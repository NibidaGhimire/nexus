The pre-insertion resistor s (PIR)  within high -voltage circuit breakers are critical component s and warm up 
by generating Joule heat when an electric current flows through  them . Elevated temperature can lead to 
temporary closure failure and, in severe cases, the rupture of PIR. To accurately predict the temperature of  
PIR, this study combines finite element simulation techniques with Support Vector Regression (SVR) 
optimized by an Improved W hale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA) approach. The IWOA includes Tent 
mapping, a convergence factor based on the sigmoid function, and the Ornstein -Uhlenbeck variation 
strategy. The IWOA -SVR  model  is compared with the SSA -SVR and WOA -SVR. The results reveal that 
the prediction accuracies of the IWOA -SVR model were 90.2% and 81.5%  (above 100° C) in the ± 3° C 
temperature deviation range and 96.3% and 9 3.4% (above 100° C) in the ± 4° C temperature deviation 
range , surpassing the performance of the comparative models. This research demonstrates  the method 
proposed can realize the online monitoring of the temperature of the PIR, which can effectively prevent 
thermal faults PIR and provide a basis for the opening and closing of the circuit breaker within a short 
period.  
 
1. Introd uction  
With the rapid economic development in China, higher demands have 
been placed on the construction of the power grid, emphasizing the signif-
icance of constructing more efficient and robust ultra -high voltage (UHV) 
and extra -high voltage (EHV) electrical networks. Concurrently, a grow-
ing number of switchgear devices, such as Gas -Insulated Switchgears 
(GIS), Hybrid Gas -Insulated Switchgears (HGIS), and tank circuit break-
ers, have widely adopted PIR in their designs [1] [2] . During the opening 
and closing operations of circuit breakers, PIR play a pivotal role in re-
ducing excitation inrush currents and transient overvoltage. Following the 
operation of opening and closing, PIR accumulate heat due to the passage 
of electrical current, leading to an increase in their internal temperature. In 
cases of frequent circuit breaker operations or the passage of substantial 
currents, excessive  temperature rise in the PIR can result in their rupture, 
preventing the normal execution of subsequent circuit breaker operations 
and posing safety risks to the power system. If the temperature of the PIR 
can be monitored online, then stop the tripping or reduce the frequency of 
tripping when the resistor temperature is too high . However, due to the 
high-voltage environment in which PIR are situated, direct temperature 
measurement is unfeasible without the incorporation of sensors. Further-
more, the heating -cooling cycle of PIR constitutes a complex, nonlinear, 
and strongly coupled process, influenced by a multitude of parameters, rendering it challenging to accurately describe through mathematical 
models.  
Nowadays artificial intelligence has been widely used in engineering 
prediction, and its classical models include SVR, Extreme Learning Ma-
chine (ELM), Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN), et al. For example,  Oktay Arikan  et al. [3] used an artifi-
cial neural network to predict the dielectric parameters of high -voltage 
cables under overvoltage to assess the short -term dielectric performance 
of the cables.  A. Ajitha  et al. [4] proposed a deep learning load forecasting 
model for the residential sector based on Recurrent Neural Network -
LSTM using real -time load data collected from local utility companies. 
The results obtained show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed 
model is better than the existing models and proves to be superior.  A. A. 
Milad et al .[5] combin ed with  random forest and multiple Markov chain 
models to predict asphalt pavement temperature . Ye Zhu  et al. [6] develops 
a model based on the integration of dual attention LSTM and autoregres-
sive moving average (ARMA)  to predict aluminum  cell temperature.  
Ephrem Chemali  et al. [7] use of deep feedforward networks for battery 
SOC estimation . Challa Santhi Durganjali  et al. [8]  used several models to 
predict PV cell performance. Among them , Kernel Ridge Regression  
(KRR ) performs the best and gives faster (within seconds), valid , and 
error -free predictions (92.23% accuracy).  Ling -Ling Li  et al.[9] proposed 
an aging degree evaluation model based on the WOA  for the Optimal 
ELM algorithm. This study investigated the use of WOA to optimize the 
input weights and hidden layer bias of ELM to improve its prediction 2  
 
performance. There are also numerous instances of AI applications in 
situations where direct temperature measurement is challenging. For in-
stance,  Boying Liu et al. [10] combined an improved cuckoo search algo-
rithm with an ELM  to predict the junction temperature of IGBTs by tak-
ing the collector -emitter saturation voltage, collector current, and number 
of cyclic aging cycles of the IGBTs as inputs.  Yuanlong Wang  et al.[11] 
used an Elman neural network (Elman NN) to estimate the temperature 
variation of lithium -ion batteries in a metal foam thermal management 
system. Zhang Shuai et  al.[12] have employed an enhanced Grey Wolf 
Algorithm  (GWO)  to optimize ELM  for predicting the coiling temperature 
of hot -rolled strip steel. Compared to traditional models, their approach 
exhibits superior accuracy and hit rates. Additionally, Zhou Jianxin et  
al.[13]  have leveraged an improved Pelican Algorithm -optimized LSTM 
for forecasting the temperature of steel billets in a heating furnace, ena-
bling precise heating, reducing energy consumption, preserving the envi-
ronment, and enhancing the quality of steel billet production. Han Xiang 
et al. [14] , on the other hand, have utilized a support vector machine  opti-
mized by the Enhanced Fish Swarm  Algorithm  to predict hotspots in 
transformer windings, effectively enhancing predictive accuracy and 
achieving favorable forecasting outcomes.  Yi Yahui et al . [15]  propose a 
digital twin (DT) technology and  LSTM -based method for real -time tem-
perature prediction. The results demonstrate that the proposed real -time 
temperature prediction framework delivers acceptable accuracy for the 
constant current  discharging and dynamic discharging conditions, which 
can complete the requirements of practical applications. This study dra-
matically reduces the response time of temperature prediction and guides 
optimizing battery thermal management systems (BTMS).  J. I. Aizpurua  
et al. [16] examined the remaining useful life  of the transformer under 
different operating conditions using an extreme gradient boosting  (XGB )-
based temperature prediction model, and collected uncertainty information 
from measurements and stochastic processes.  Chen [17]  et al.  developed a 
predictive model based on Gate Recursive Unit (GRU) that utilizes tem-
perature, fuel, and air time series to predict furnace temperatures.  
Much of the current research on PIR can be divided into the following 
categories: power  testing, switching techniques, applications in other 
scenarios, and fault analysis. H. Heiermeier  et al. [18]  provide alternative 
test methods consisting of multiple steps for power testing of PIR without 
compromising its important parameters. In order to mitigate capacitor 
bank switching transients, synchronized switches using PIR technology 
have been developed and used in ultra -high voltage transmission sys-
tems [19] . They also investigated the coupling relationship between sever-
al key factors affecting switching transients; closing target angle, resistor 
insertion time, and resistor size are all key factors in switching transients 
for both single -group and back -to-back switches. Kunal A. Bhatt et al. [20]  
minimize the level of asymmetric DC component of charging current 
during energization of a shunt reactor using a Controlled Switching De-
vice (CSD)  with a PIR-Circuit Breaker , by optimizing the insertion instant, 
value and Electrical Insertion Time of PIR. T. Eliyan et al. [21]  used the 
PIR of a conventional circuit breaker with three other link technologies to 
reduce operational overvoltage in wind farms. It was found that PIR and 
R-L smart choke successfully reduced the operational overvoltage by an 
average of 52% in wind farms with radial and star topologies.  Xiaohui 
Chen et al. [22] used PIR and CSD for AC filter circuit breakers for tran-
sient calculations and gave the optimal configuration.  Kunal A. Bhatt et al. 
[23]  proposed using CSD with PIR - Circuit Breaker  for further mitigation 
of the switching surge during energization/re -energization of Un -
compensated Transmission Line (UCTL) and Shunt reactor compensated 
Transmission Line (SCTL). Based on two PIR failure s in series and paral-lel structures, Bo Niu et al.  [24] [22]  propose methods such as dynamic 
resistance fitting, acoustic and vibration signal detection, insulation per-
formance test, and heat capacity test during operation . H. Shi et al. [25]  
simulated three types of faults, short circuit, breakdown ,and open circuit, 
in the PIR. It is found that when the  PIR is faulted, the parameters such as 
harmonic content in the closing inrush, time of occurrence of peak inrush, 
and three -phase inconsistency are significantly different from the normal 
condition, and these are applied to the PIR fault diagnosis technique.  
This paper presents an IWOA -optimized SVR model for the prediction of 
PIR temperatures, incorporating finite element simulation data as samples 
and integrating the Tent mapping, a convergence factor based on the 
Sigmoid function, and Ornstein -Uhlenbeck variation strategy. The predic-
tive accuracy of the proposed IWOA -SVR temperature forecasting model 
is compared with that of the SSA -SVR and WOA -SVR models. The re-
sults demonstrate that the proposed IWOA -SVR temperature prediction 
model exhibits superior accuracy, enabling more precise temperature 
forecasting for PIR. 
2. IWOA -SVR algorithm  
2.1. Support vector regression model  
SVR is a widely applied regression algorithm, with its core concept cen-
tered around constructing a hyperplane with a margin for regression pre-
diction. Its fundamental principle involves minimizing the distance be-
tween the hyperplane and the farthest data points while neglecting the loss 
incurred by data points within the margin, considering only those data 
points whose absolute difference from the true values exceeds a tolerance 

. To address nonlinear regression problems, SVR utilizes kernel func-
tions to map low -dimensional data into higher -dimensional spaces, effec-
tively approximating the nonlinear problem as a linear regression one. The 
objective function and constraints  [26] are represented as shown in Equa-

2.2. WOA  
WOA is an intelligent optimization algorithm that simulates the hunting 
behavior of humpback whales [27] . During the hunting process, hump-
back whales gather to encircle their prey  and subsequently spiral upwards 
while releasing numerous bubbles to form a bubble net, corralling and 
driving the prey toward the center of the bubble net before finally con-
suming it. The core of the WOA algorithm lies in mathematically model-
ing the humpback whale's actions of encircling, bubble net attack, and 
prey searching [28] . 
1)Encircling the Prey: In the encircling phase, the best whale is defined as 
the one closest to the prey. Subsequently, other whales update their posi-
tions based on the location of the best whale to achieve the encirclement 
of the prey. The equations for this process are expressed as (2) and (3):

gence factor , and will gradually decrease linearly from 2 to 0 as the and 
will gradually decrease as the increase of

bers between [0,1].  
2)Bubble Net Attack: Upon entering the bubble net attack phase, hump-
back whales not only tighten their encircling formation but also ascend in 
a spiral motion toward the prey. Assuming that the probabilities of select-
ing these two behaviors are equal, the updated positions of the whales are 
computed based on Equation (4).

3)Searching for Prey: During the prey searching phase, whales randomly 
select one whale from the population to approach, thereby enhancing the 
global search capability of the whale population [29] . The mathematical 
expression corresponding to this process is given in Equation (5).

where

2.3. Improvement of the WOA algorithm  
2.3.1.  Tent mappin g 
One of the improvement strategies for swarm intelligence algorithms is to 
achieve a more uniform initial population distribution, thereby mitigating 
the effects of uneven distributions caused by random initialization [30] . 
WOA often employs random initialization of whale positions, which can 
lead to difficulties in exploring the search space during the initial stages of 
the algorithm and may result in the algorithm getting stuck in local optima. 
To address the limitations of random population initialization, the use of 
chaotic algorithms can promote a more uniform population distribution 
throughout the search sp ace. Compared to another prevalent chaotic map-
ping, the logistic map, the tent map exhibits superior uniform traversal 
characteristics [31] . Consequently, the tent map is employed for initializ-
ing the whale population positions. The tent mapping formula is as fol-
lows:

where  
1 xx+、  are the positions of the initial whale after  
、

iterations, respectively.  
2.3.2.  Convergence factor based on sigmoid function  
In the standard WOA , the convergence factor "
a " linearly decreases 
from 2 to 0 without considering the need for a thorough search in the early 
iterations to escape local optima and rapid iterations in the later stages to 
reduce iteration time. Based on the sigmoid function, a new convergence 
factor is constructed, expressed as follows:  
 
max 6( / 1)14 0.5
1a
e−=  −+  (7) 
where  
max is the maximum number of iterations . The improved convergence factor curve is illustrated in Fig .1. In the early 
iterations, the slope of this curve is relatively low, which is advantageous 
for allowing the whales in the algorithm to explore the global optimum in 
a divergent manner. In the later iterations, the improved convergence 
factor exhibits a steep slope, enhancing the convergence speed. Compared 
to the original convergence factor, the improved convergence factor per-
forms better in seeking the global optimum and achieves a faster conver-
gence rate.  
 Fig. 1 Improved convergence factor  
2.3.3.  Incorporating the Ornstein -Uhlenbeck mutation 
strategy   
Traditional mutation choices include the normal distribution or Cauchy 
distribution [32] [33] . However, when using these distributions, as the 
probabilities are positive, the optimal values can only mutate in a positive 
direction, which does not fulfill the requirement for negative -direction 
mutations. The Ornstein -Uhlenbeck process (OU process), while main-
taining randomness, exhibits both positive and negative values [34] [35] , 
and it also possesses a certain degree of temporal correlation. An illustra-
tion of one such stochastic process is shown in Fig .2. From Fig .2, it can 
be observed that the OU process produces values that can be both positive 
and negative, falling within the range of [ -0.24, 0.24], making it a suitable 
choice for perturbations.

While the a forementioned mutations enhance the algorithm's capability to 
escape local spaces, they do not guarantee that the fitness value of the new 
position after perturbation mutation will be superior to that of the original 
position. Consequently, following perturbation mutation updates, a greedy 
rule is introduced to determine whether the position should be updated by 
comparing the fitness values of the old and new positions. The greedy rule 
is defined as follows, where 𝑓(𝑥) represents the fitness value of the posi-
tion.

2.3.4.  IWOA Implementation Steps  
The steps of IWOA incorporating the above improvements are as follows : 
Step .1 Initialize the fundamental parameters of the WOA . 
Step .2 Initialize the whale position  using the tent chaotic mapping.  
Step .3 Calculate the fitness of all individual whales and sort them.  
Step .4 Record the position of the best -performing whale in terms of fit-
ness.  
Step .5 Apply the Ornstein -Uhlenbeck mutation to the best -performing 
whale's current position, generating a mutated solution, and calculate the 
fitness of the mutated solution according to Equation (8).  
Step .6 If the fitness of the mutated solution surpasses that of the original, 
replace the original with the mutated solution.  
Step .7 Compute the magnitude of the convergence factor using Equation 
(9) and update the position vectors according to Equation (10).  
Step .8 If the algorithm satisfies the termination condition, terminate and 
output the best solution; otherwise, proceed to Step .3. 
2.4. IWOA  performance  test 
To evaluate the performance of the proposed IWOA, seven benchmark 
functions from CEC2005 were selected for algorithm comparison. The 
comparison was conducted in conjunction with the GWO, Sparrow Search 
Algorithm (SSA), and WOA. The number of whale populations is set to 
30, the dimensions of the test functions are 10, 30 and 50, the  maximum  
number of iterations is 1000, and the number of independent runs of each 
test function is 30.  Tab.1 provides information about the test functions, 
while Tab .2 presents the results of the function tests.  
Tab.1 Information  of test functions  
Label Function  Range  Optimal value  Peak value  
F1 Sphere  [-100,100]  0 single peak  
F2 Schwefel2.22  [-10,10]  0 single peak  
F3 Schwefel1.2  [-100,100]  0 single peak  
F4 Schwefel2.21  [-100,100]  0 single peak  
F5 Ackley  [-32,32]  0 multi -peak  
F6 Penalized1  [-50,50]  0 multi -peak  
F7 Penalized2  [-50,50]  0 multi -peak  
The specific results of the 4 algorithms optimizing the 7 benchmark test 
functions are shown in Tab.2  (all optimal values have been bolded .). In 
Tab.2, on the single -peak functions F1 -F4, the IWOA algorithm has a 
mean, standard deviation and optimal value of 0. The mean value is the 
theoretical optimal value, which is a large improvement compared to the 
remaining three algorithms. While on the multi -peak function F5, IWOA is close to the optimal value of WOA, but slightly inferior to the compari-
son algorithms in mean and standard deviation. On the multi -peak func-
tions F6 and F7, IWOA is better than the comparison algorithm in terms 
of mean and standard deviation.  The convergence curves for the seven test 
functions when the dimension of the test function is 30  are shown in Fig .3. 
From Fig.3, it can be seen that on the F1 -F7 functions, the convergence 
speed of IWOA is greatly improved relative to the comparison algorithm, 
especially on the F1 -F4 functions. The mean, standard deviation, optimal 
value and convergence speed of the IWOA algorithm in these seven test 
functions are significantly better than the comparison algorithm s in gen-
eral, which proves the effectiveness of the improvement strategy.

3. Simulation and Predictive Evaluation of PIR Temperatu
re Rise  
3.1. PIR temperature rise simulation  
When a high current passes through the PIR, it accumulates a significant 
amount of heat. The  PIR, which is at a temperature higher than the ambi-
ent temperature, undergoes heat conduction, convection, and thermal 
radiation interactions with its surroundings, including nearby objects and 
the environment. The entire physical field involves three main aspects: the 
electrical field, the heat field , and  the flow field . The interrelationships 
among these three physical fields are depicted in Fig .4. 
 
Fig.4 Relationship between multiple  physical fields  
In the COMSOL Multiphysics environment, a two -dimensional axisym-
metric simulation model (Fig .5) is constructed. The model comprises 35  
PIR sheets , two copper plates, an insulating rod, a tank filled with SF 6, 
and an outer steel casing [36] . Since the PIR sheets  are tightened with 
bolts, no gap is explicitly modeled between them in the simulation. How-ever, there is a necessary gap between the insulating rod and the PIR 
sheets due to their mating relationship, which affects the cooling of the 
PIR and cannot be neglected. Therefore, this gap should be included in the 
simulation, approximately set to 1 mm. The current is injected into the 
bottom  copper plate, while the topmost  copper plate is grounded.  Fig.5 
also illustrates the temperature field distribution across the PIR after simu-
lation . Tab.3 shows the physical parameters of the main substances of the 
simulation model . The parameters of the PIR are taken from the technical 
documentation provided by the manufacturer and the parameters of the 
insulated pole are taken from literatures [37] [38] , where the PIR conduc-
tivity is shown in Fig.6:

COMSOL utilizes finite element analysis, and thus, the mesh used signifi-
cantly impacts the computational results. A denser mesh can lead to a 
large computational load, while a coarser mesh may result in less accurate 
results.  Three different grid sizes are selected, i.e., each PIR sheet is di-
vided into 10*10, 15*15, and 20*20 cells. The calculation results for 
different grids are shown in Fig. 7. The results show that the change  tem-
perature is negligible when the number of grids is raised from 100 to 400. 
In order to reduce the amount of calculation, 100 grids per  PIR sheets  are 
used in this paper.  The final mesh for the model is depicted in Fig .8.

3.2. Data Set Acquisition   
There are five factors that affect the temperature of the PIR after cooling: 
the value of the closing current, the closing phase angle, the input  current 
time, the cooling time, and the initial temperature of the PIR. The closing 
current is approximated as a sinusoidal wave. 500 kV circuit breaker PIR 
sheets  for thermal capacity experiments into the larger 1600A sinusoidal 
current. PIR input time is generally 8 -12ms. In order to increase the diver-
sity of the dataset, the ranges of current and input current time were set to 
[0A,1600A] and [7ms,12ms], respectively . In accordance with State G rid 
requirements , for important lines, when single -phase reclosing is unsuc-
cessful and three -phase tripping occurs, the trial delivery time is not less 
than 30 minutes from the last tripping time interval, so the maximum 
prediction time is set to 1800s.  For the prediction of the closing phase 
angle is set to [0,2π]. The PIR sheets  require that the temperature rise 
should not exceed 125° C at an ambient temperature of 25° C.  The mini-mum initial temperature is set to 293K (ambient temperature is 20° C), and 
the maximum temperature is set to 393K, which is close to the maximum 
allowable temperature of the resistor (423K). The other factors are ig-
nored as they hardly change during the switching process. The ranges for 
the above five factors were set as Tab.4. In finite element simulation, 
since the mesh cannot be encrypted indefinitely, sometimes there are 
singular values, which may simulate inaccurate maximum values. The 
maximum  temperature of the PIR has an extremely important role in its 
state evaluation. After many experiments, the temperature distribution of 
the PIR is more uniform after cooling  (Fig.5) , i.e., the maximum value of 
the PIR is very close to the average value. Therefore, the simulation and 
prediction of the temperature value of the PIR in this paper are  the aver-
age temperature of 35 PIR sheet s.

A total of 4 ,000 sets of variables are randomly generated using tent map-

obtain the post -cooling temperatures of the PIR under 4000 different 
scenarios.  Some of the simulation data are shown in Tab .5.

3.3. Analysis of projected results   
To validate the predictive performance of the IWOA for optimizing SVR, 
a testing dataset consisting of 30% of the data is selected. Two other mod-
els, WOA -SVR and SSA -SVR, are chosen for comparison. Evaluation of 
the models is conducted using three metrics: the coefficient of determina-
tion ( R2), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). 
The results of the models are summarized in Tab .6, and the hit rate of 
each model is presented in Fig .9 and Fig. 10.

IWOA -SVR  0.99371  4.64762  1.76508  
In Tab.6 (all best values have been bolded ), it is evident that the proposed 
IWOA -SVR model outperforms the other two models. It achieves reduc-
tions in both MSE and MAE, while simultaneously increasing R2. In Fig. 9, 
the horizontal axis represents the magnitude of the difference between the 
simulated and predicted values, and the vertical axis represents the pro-
portion of the number of samples in the interval of the difference to the 
total samples, i.e., the hit rate. It can be seen that IWOA -SVR is lower 
than SSA -SVR and WOA -SVR by 1.1% and 1% in the interval [ -1,1], 
respectively. But in the other three intervals, it is IWOA -SVR that has the 
highest hit rate. Especially in the interval [ -3,3], the hit rate of IWOA -
SVR is 90.2 %, which is 3% higher than that of SSA -SVR.  The hit rate of 
IWOA -SVR is 96.3% in [ -4,4], which is 1.6% (SSA -SVR) and 1.5% 
(WOA -SVR) ahead of the other models, respectively.  
 
Fig.9 Hit ratio  
The prediction accuracy of the model in high temperature environments is 
critical for the operation of the PIR at high temperatures. The PIR sheets  
require that the temperature rise should not exceed 125° C at an ambient 
temperature of 25° C. Fig .10 illustrates the difference between the simulat-
ed temperature and the model -predicted temperature at simulated tempera-
tures above 100° C. In the [ -1,1] error interval, the hit rate of IWOA -SVR 
is slightly lower than the other two. Whereas, in the other three error 
intervals, IWOA -SVR has the highest hit rate. In particular, in the [ -4,4] 
interval, which is more concerned with practical engineering, the hit rate 
of IWOA -SVR is 6% (SSA -SVR) and 3.8% (WOA -SVR) ahead of the 
other models, respectively.  These results demonstrate the validity of the 
model and prove the high feasibility of the proposed method for high -
precision temperature prediction of PIR in the real engineering field.

4. Conclusion  
This study has made improvements to the traditional WOA in terms of 
initial population, convergence factor, and mutation algorithm. The 
IWOA -SVR  has been applied to the prediction of the PIR temperature, 
leading to the following key findings:  
1) When testing the IWOA against WOA, GWO, and SSA using seven 
test functions, IWOA outperforms the other three algorithms in terms of 
the mean, standard deviation, and best value for six of the functions. 
Moreover, IWOA exhibits a significant advantage in convergence speed 
across all seven test functions relative to the other three algorithms. This 
suggests that the IWOA  excels in convergence speed and accuracy com-
pared  to three other algorithms , and it is less prone to getting stuck in 
local optima.  Therefore, IWOA is more advantageous in finding the opti-
mal penalization factor and the hyperparameters of RBF kernel function  in 
SVR.  
2) IWOA -SVR is applied to the temperature prediction of the PIR sheets . 
Compared with  WOA -SVR and SSA -SVR , the results show that the R2, 
MSE, and MAE of IWOA -SVR are enhance d in temperature predic tion. 
The hit rat io of IWOA -SVR in predicting the temperature is 90.2%  within  
± 3° C , and 96.3%  within ± 4° C . For temperatures above 100° C, the hit 
ratio is 81.5% within ± 3° C and 93.4% within ± 4° C, which is a significant 
improvement relative to the other two models.  
3) Most of the current research es focus on the power testing, switching 
technology, application, and fault judgment of PIR. The method proposed 
in this paper can realize the online  monitoring of the temperature of the 
PIR, which can avoid thermal failure of PIR and provide reliable evidence 
for the opening and closing of the circuit breaker in the power grid in a 
short period of time.
