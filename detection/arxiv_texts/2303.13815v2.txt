IRREDUCIBLE GRADED BIMODULES OVER ALGEBRAS AND A PIERCE
DECOMPOSITION OF THE JACOBSON RADICAL
ANTONIO DE FRANC ¸A†AND IRINA SVIRIDOVA
Abstract. It is well known that the ring radical theory can be approached via language of modules.
In this work, we present some generalizations of classical results from module theory, in the two-
sided and graded sense. Let Gbe a group, Fan algebraically closed field with char(F) = 0, Aa finite
dimensional G-graded associative F-algebra and MaG-graded unitary A-bimodule. We proved that
ifA=Mn(Fσ[H]) with a canonical elementary G-grading, where His a finite abelian subgroup of G
andσ∈Z2(H,F∗), then Mbeing irreducible graded implies that there exists a nonzero homogeneous
element w∈Msatisfying M=BwandBw=wB. Another result we proved generalizes the last one:
ifGis abelian, Ais simple graded and Mis finitely generated, then there exist nonzero homogeneous
elements w1, w2, . . . , w n∈Msuch that
M=Aw1⊕Aw2⊕ ··· ⊕ Awn,
where wiA=Awi̸= 0 for all i= 1,2, . . . , n , and each Awiis irreducible. The elements wi’s are
associated with the irreducible characters of G. We also describe graded bimodules over graded
semisimple algebras. And we finish by presenting a Pierce decomposition of the graded Jacobson
radical of any finite dimensional F-algebra with a G-grading.
1.Introduction
Amitsur started in [2] the construction of the general theory of radicals. As explained by Kurosch
in his work [24], the concept of radical has great importance in the study of associative algebras and
rings. The study of radicals constitutes an important tool for the development of Ring Theory. In
[3], Amitsur presents an axiomatic foundation for radicals of rings. From this, Andrunakieviˇ c and
Rjabuhin showed in [4] that the general theory of radicals of associative rings developed by Kurosh
and Amitsur (and others) may be presented in the language of modules, and consequently in the
language of representations.
In [19], Jacobson initiated the study of bimodules1of Jordan algebras, and in [20], the author
presented a study about the structure of alternative and Jordan bimodules. In turn, Foster, in [12],
presented a study showing that the general theory of radicals of associative rings can be naturally ex-
tended to varieties of algebras where the modules are replaced by bimodules. Already in [32], Shestakov
and Trushina described the irreducible birepresentations of alternative2algebras and superalgebras.
For more details about radicals ,(bi)modules andrepresentations (of groups) , see [8, 13, 16, 26, 36].
LetRandSbe two rings, and Man (R,S)-bimodule. Remember that any ring is a Z-bimodule. In
[7], Brown and Smith examined what properties of Mare guaranteed when Rand Sare noetherian
andMis finitely generated as a left R-module and as a right S-module. The study of these noetherian
bimodules played an important role in advancing in noetherian ring theory.
Giambruno and Zaicev, on the other hand, in [14], needed to describe the Jacobson radical Jof an
algebra A=B⊕J, which is a B-bimodule, to prove their main results in the work, where B=Mn(F)

is the algebra of n×nmatrices over a field F. According to Wisbauer ([36]), one of the most important
techniques in the theory of commutative associative algebras, and which can be successfully transferred
to non-commutative associative algebras via one-sided modules, is the homological characterization of
an algebra Ain the category of (one-sided) A-modules. Once the study of module theory has been
used to describe the structure of algebras, Wisbauer devoted almost 400 pages of his book [36] to
presenting a compilation of the theory.
The problems exposed above show the importance of studying modules and radicals, and that
famous mathematicians and algebraists have studied – especially the properties of these structures
– these topics in the last decades. In this sense, we study in this work algebraic objects known as
bimodules . More specifically, here we study bimodules over algebras graded by groups . Our results
imply in a characterization of graded Jacobson radical of a suitable family of algebras.
Algebraic structures with gradings by groups ensure a very rich field of research, in ring theory,
because from a structure of grading we can deduce properties of the ordinary object (i.e. object
without grading). In [5], Theorem 3, Bahturin, Sehgal and Zaicev showed that, when Gis a group
andFis an algebraically closed field with char(F) = 0, “ any finite-dimensional G-graded F-algebra
Ais simple graded iff Ais isomorphic to Mk(Fσ[H]), where His a finite subgroup of Gandσis a
2-cocycle on H”. Based on this lastest work, in [34], Lemma 2, Sviridova presented a generalization of
Wedderburn-Malcev Theorem3for algebras graded by a (finite abelian) group. She established that, in
suitable conditions, any finite dimensional graded algebra Ais a direct sum of a maximal semisimple
graded subalgebra Mk1(Fσ1[H1])× ··· × Mkp(Fσp[Hp]), where H1, . . . , Hpare finite subgroups of G,
and its Jacobson radical J(A), which is graded. Note that J(A) is naturally a graded A-bimodule,
and obviously a graded A/J(A)-bimodule. Therefore, it is important to study graded bimodules over
simple graded algebras, and in special the graded bimodules over the matrix algebras Mr(Fσ[H])’s,
since any finite-dimensional simple graded algebras are given by matrix algebras.
In this work, our interest is to study the graded bimodules and its irreducible graded subbimodules,
as well as to apply this study to describe the graded Jacobson radical of a graded algebra. We studied
the irreducible graded subbimodules of a graded bimodule M, as well as the possibles decompositions
forMin sum of irreducible graded objects. Basically, we have answered the following question:
Problem: How to describe the irreducible graded bimodules?
In this way, we have some natural questions: how to characterize the irreducible graded bimodules?
When is possible to write a graded bimodule as sum of irreducible graded subbimodules? How do the
considered algebras interfere in the bimodules? Is it possible to present a decomposition of Jacobson
radical (of a finite dimensional graded algebra) in irreducible graded subbimodules? If so, how and
what are the consequences?
LetFbe a field, Ga group and AandeAtwo associative algebras. Consider Man (A,eA)-bimodule.
Now, consider G-gradings on AandeA, namely, A=⊕g∈GAgandeA=⊕h∈GeAh, and M=⊕t∈GMta
G-grading on M, i.e. the Mt’s are subspaces of Mwhich satisfy AgMt⊂MgtandMteAh⊂Mthfor any
t, g, h∈G. To more details, as well as an overview, about graded algebras and rings, as well as general
theory of modules, see the works [27, 28, 36] and their references.
Firstly, we record in §2 definitions and concepts necessary for the better development of this work.
The reader familiarized with objects as G-graded bimodules ,G-noetherian bimodules ,G-artinian bi-
modules ,2-cocycles on G,twisted group algebra andgroup characters , can continue reading from page
10, returning if necessary. Later, we dedicated in §3 of this work to generalize (in language of the
graded bimodules) some classic results of (one-sided) modules theory, as Jordan-H¨ older Theorem, Iso-
morphisms theorems and Correspondence Theorem. The main theorem of this first results section is
given by:
3The Wedderburn-Malcev Theorem (see [8], Theorem 72.19, p.491), which is a generalization made by Malcev, in
[25], of one of Wedderburn’s Theorem, states that for any finite dimensional algebra over a field Fsuch that A/J(A) is
separable, there exists a unique (up to the isomorphism) maximal semisimple subalgebra BofAsatisfying A=B⊕J(A).Irreducible Graded Bimodules over Algebras and a Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical 3
Theorem 3.11 : IfAandeAare weak G-artinian and weak G-noetherian, then the following conditions
are equivalent: i) Mis finitely generated; ii) Mis weak G-noetherian; iii) Mis weak G-artinian and
weak G-noetherian; iv) Mhas a graded composition series.
In the theorem above, the word “weak” refers to the chains being of (graded) subbimodules. Other
important result of this section, which is presented in the subsection 3.1, is inspired by Lemma 2 in
[14] and it is given by
Theorem 3.13 Suppose AandeAtwo unitary algebras. If Mhas a finite dimension (as vector space),
then Mcan be decomposed as M=M00⊕M10⊕M01⊕M11,where Mij’s are G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodules
such that:
i) for r= 0,1,M0ris a 0-left A-module and M1ris a unitary left G-graded A-module;
ii) for s= 0,1,Ms0is a 0-right eA-module and Ms1is a unitary right G-graded eA-module;
iii)M11is a unitary G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodule.
In addition, if A(resp. eA) is simple graded, then M1r(resp. Mr1) is faithful on the left (resp. on the
right), for i= 0,1.
In consequence from the previous result, we show in Corollary 3.14 that Mis a unitary ( A,eA)-
bimodule if and only if M=M11. In§4, we describe the unitary bimodule M.
The main results of this work are in §4. The aim of this section is to exhibit a description of
irreducible graded bimodules and a (special) decomposition of finitely generated graded bimodules.
Given Ha finite abelian subgroup of a group G,σ∈Z2(H,F∗) a 2-cocycle on H,B=Mn(Fσ[H]) the
n×nmatrix algebra over Fσ[H], and MaG-graded B-bimodule, the key object for the most important
results in this section is given by elements of the form
(1) ˆ wχ=nX
i=1 X
h∈Hχ(h)σ(h, h−1)−1ηhEi1m0E1iηh−1!
,
where χ:H→F∗is an irreducible character of H,Eij’s are the elementary matrices of Mn(F)
andηhEi1, E1iηh−1∈Mn(Fσ[H]), and m0∈Mis a nonzero homogeneous element. Here, BisG-
graded by a canonical elementary defined by an n-tuple ( g1, . . . , g n)∈Gn(i.e.B=L
g∈GBg, where
Bg=spanF{Eijηh∈B:g−1
ihgj=g}), and the elements ˆ wχ’s belong to Mand their product by the
basic (homogeneous) elements Eijηg’s ofMn(Fσ[H]) is commutative, up to a scalar. The key and more
important result of §4 is the
Theorem 4.3 : Let Gbe a group, Ha finite abelian subgroup of G, and Fan algebraically closed
field such that char(F) = 0. Consider MaG-graded unitary B-bimodule, where B=Mn(Fσ[H]) with
a canonical elementary G-grading and σ∈Z2(H,F∗). If Mis irreducible graded, then there exists a
nonzero homogeneous element w∈Msatisfying M=Bw, such that Bw=wB.
The element wdefined in the previous theorem is associated with an irreducible character of H, and
it is defined similarly to (1).
In the result below, we present a decomposition for the graded bimodules over a simple graded
algebra when such bimodules are finitely generated. In its proof we use the elements ˆ wχ’s. This result
is very important, and gives a decomposition into irreducible (subbimodules) similar to the one-sided
case of modules. Such decomposition will be used to give a characterization of Jacobson radical of a
family of the finite dimensional algebras.
Theorem 4.7 : LetFbe an algebraically closed field, Gan abelian group and Aa finite dimensional
algebra over Fwith a G-grading. Suppose that char(F) = 0, and Ais simple graded. If Mis a finitely
generated G-graded A-bimodule, then there exist nonzero homogeneous elements w1, w2, . . . , w n∈M
such that
M=Aw1⊕Aw2⊕ ··· ⊕ Awn
where wiA=Awi̸= 0 for all i= 1,2, . . . , n , and Awiis irreducible.4 DE FRANC ¸A AND SVIRIDOVA
We finalized §4 exhibiting a decomposition of bimodules over weak semisimple algebras in the form
of a Pierce decomposition (see Theorem 4.8). We prove that “ ifAandeAare weak semisimple graded,
andMis a unitary G-graded (A,eA)-bimodule, then there exist central orthogonal idempotent elements
i1, . . . ,ip∈Aandˆi1, . . . ,ˆiq∈eAsuch that A=Lp
r=1Ar,eA=Lq
s=1eAs, and M=Lp,q
r,s=1irMˆis, where
Ar=Air,eAs=eAˆis”. Moreover, we showed that each irMˆisis either equal to {0}or a faithful G-graded
(Ar,eAs)-bimodule.
We finalize this work with one (our two) application of our main results. A big problem in the
study of Ring Theory arises when we try to describe the properties of a ring R, more precisely, its
Jacobson radical. In what follows, we exhibit a decomposition of the Jacobson radical of an algebra
which can be used as a tool in future studies of the theory. For more details about Jacobson radical,
we recommend the books [16, 21, 30].
LetGbe a group and A=B⊕Ja finite dimensional algebra with a G-grading, where Bis a
maximal semisimple G-graded subalgebra of A, and J=J(A) is the Jacobson radical and a graded
ideal of A. Besides of the decomposition guaranteed by Theorem 3.13, the Theorem 5.2 states that if
B=Mk1(Fσ1[H1])× ··· × Mkp(Fσp[Hp]),Gis finite abelian, and Fis an algebraically closed field with
char(F) = 0, then
a)J11=Lp
s,r=1irJ11is, where each irJ11isis aG-graded ( Br,Bs)-bimodule, where B=Lp
i=1Bi
withBi=Mki(Fσi[Hi]). In addition, irJ11is̸= 0 implies that irJ11isis a faithful left Bi-module
and a faithful right Bj-module;
b) For each s= 1, . . . , p , there exists a G-graded vector space Ns=spanF{d1s, . . . , d rss} ⊂isJ11is
such that isJ11is=BsNsandbdis=γis(b)disb̸= 0 for any nonzero b∈βs, and i= 1, . . . , r s,
where γis∈F, and βs={Elsjsηhs∈Bs:ls, js= 1, . . . , k s, hs∈Hs}is the canonical
homogeneous basis of Bs=Mks(Fσs[Hs]). Moreover, for each i= 1, . . . , r s, we have that
Bsdisis aG-simple Bs-bimodule.
The decomposition of Jacobson radical of a finite dimensional graded algebra presented in the
previous theorem can be used to describe graded varieties4of graded algebras, which are studied in PI-
Theory. A famous problem in PI-Theory is the well known Specht’s Problem5. Kemer showed in [23]
that the Specht’s Problem has a positive solution in the variety of associative algebras of characteristic
zero. In [34], Sviridova proved the graded case (see Theorem 2, [34]). Specifically, Sviridova showed
that “ ifFis an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and Gis any finite abelian group, then
anyGT-ideal of graded identities of a G-graded associative PI-algebra over Fcoincides with the ideal
ofG-graded identities of the G-graded Grassmann envelope of some finite dimensional G×Z2-graded
associative F-algebra ”. It is important to comment that Aljadeff and Kanel-Belov proved in [1] (see
Theorem 1.3), independently of Sviridova, a similar result for any finite group. From this, to study a
graded variety WofG-graded associative algebras, it is enough to study the Grassmann envelope6
of a finite dimensional G×Z2-graded algebra of type A= 
Mk1(Fσ1[H1])× ··· × Mkp(Fσp[Hp])
⊕J,
where J=J(A) has a decomposition as the described in Theorem 5.2.
To conclude, in the conditions of Corollary 4.10, i.e. the units ir’s of the Mkr(Fσr[Hr])’s are central
inA, we have that J=J00⊕J11, where J11=i1Ji1⊕ ··· ⊕ ipJip. And thus, it is easy to see that
A∼=G(Mk1(Fσ1[H1])⊕i1Ji1)× ··· × 
Mkp(Fσp[Hp])⊕ipJip
×J00.
4A graded variety generated by S⊂F⟨XG⟩, denoted by varG(S), is the class of graded associative algebras that satisfy
anyg∈S, i.e. a G-graded algebra Abelongs to varG(S) iffg≡G0 inAfor any g∈S. For more details about (graded)
varieties of (graded) algebras, see [11], Chapter 2, or [15], Chapter 1.
5Specht’s Problem was purposed in [33] by W. Specht (1950), and it can be formulated by the following question:
given any algebra A, is any set of polynomial identities of Aa consequence of a finite number of identities of A? For
more details about Specht’s Problem, see [6].
6The Grassmann envelope of a ( G×Z2)-graded algebra Ais given by EG(A) = ( A0⊗E0)⊕(A1⊗E1), which is
naturally G×Z2-graded and G-graded. Here, E=E0⊕E1is an infinitely generated non-unitary Grassmann al-
gebra, i.e. E=⟨e1, e2, e3,··· |eiej=−ejei,∀i, j⟩isZ2-graded with E0=spanF{ei1ei2···ein:nis even }, and
E1=spanF{ej1ej2···ejm:mis odd }(see§3.7 in [15], p.80-83).Irreducible Graded Bimodules over Algebras and a Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical 5
Therefore, to study the graded variety W, and consequently its algebras, it is enough to study
the algebras EG(Mkr(Fσr[Hr])⊕irJir)’s, and more specifically, the algebras EG(Mkr(Fσr[Hr]))’s and
EG(irJir)’s.
2.Preliminary Results
In this section, we recall some concepts, although basic, which are important for our study. We
talk a little bit about the definitions of “ algebra grading by a group ”, “bimodules over algebras ” and
“graded bimodules over graded algebras ”, as well as other important definitions. Later, let us introduce
“G-graded bimodules ”, “weak G-noetherian bimodules ” and “ weak G-artinian bimodules ”, and other
definitions connected to graded bimodules. We dedicate a part of the work to recall some (important)
definitions and properties of “ 2-cocycles ”, “twisted group algebra ” and “ group characters ”. The reader
familiarized with these definitions and their main properties can continue from §3. Here, unless stated
otherwise, all the algebras Aare associative algebras over a field F, and Gis a group.
2.1.Bimodules over Algebras. Initially, let us define bimodules over algebras, as well as other
related definitions. Let us assume known the main definitions and properties of the (one-sided) modules
over algebras. For a detailed view of (one-sided) modules over algebras, we suggest reading Chapter 2
in [8], or Chapter 6 in [30].
Definition 2.1. LetFbe a field, AandeAtwoF-algebras (not necessarily unitary), and ManF-vector
space. We say that Mis an (A,eA)-bimodule if it is a left A-module and a right eA-module, and its
multiplication by scalar satisfies the associative law
r(ms) = (rm)s
for any r∈A,s∈eAandm∈M. When A=eA, we say that Mis an A-bimodule . When Aand
eAare unitary, Mis aunitary (A,eA)-bimodule iffMis a unitary left A-module and a unitary right
eA-module.
LetAandeAbe two algebras, and Man (A,eA)-bimodule. Recall that a left(resp. right )sub-
module NofMis a subspace of Mwhich is also a left A-module (resp. right ˜A-module). Take a
subset SofM. Let us denote by AS(resp. S˜A) the left (resp. right) submodule of Mgiven by
AS=spanF{rm∈M:r∈A, m∈S}(resp. S˜A=spanF{˜ms∈M:s∈˜A,˜m∈S}). Observe that
not always Sis a subset of AS(resp. S˜A). From this, we define the left(resp. right )submod-
ule of Mgenerated by S, denoted by AS(resp. S˜A), as being AS=spanF{m∈S}+AS(resp.
S˜A=spanF{m∈S}+S˜A). Observe that, necessarily, Sis a subset of AS(resp. S˜A). IfA(resp. ˜A)
is unitary, and Mis a unitary left A-module (resp. right ˜A-module), then AS=AS(resp. S˜A=S˜A),
andAS(resp. S˜A) is a unitary left A-module (resp. right ˜A-module). Already a subbimodule N
ofMis a subspace of Mwhich is also an ( A,eA)-bimodule. Let us denote by ASeAthe subbimodule
ofMgiven by ASeA=spanF{q˘mp∈M:q∈A, p∈eA,˘m∈S}. We define the subbimodule of M
generated by S, denoted by ASeA, as being ASeA=spanF{m∈S}+AS+SeA+ASeA. Observe that
ASeA⊆ASeAandS⊆ASeA, but not necessarily Sbelongs to ASeA. IfS={m}, we denote AS,S˜Aand
ASeAbyAm,m˜AandAmeA, respectively, when no confusion can arise. When AandeAare unitary,
andMis a unitary ( A,eA)-bimodule, we have that ASeA=ASeA, and ASeAis a unitary ( A,eA)-bimodule.
Definition 2.2. An(A,eA)-bimodule Mis called irreducible (orsimple ) ifAMeA̸={0}, and {0}
andMare the only subbimodules of M. Particularly, the condition AMeA̸={0}means that am˜a̸= 0
for some a∈A,˜a∈eAandm∈M.
For any irreducible ( A,eA)-bimodule M, we have M=AmeAfor any nonzero m∈M. Indeed, it is
sufficient to see that N={m∈M:AmeA={0}}is a subbimodule of M, and hence, we can conclude
that N={0}. When Mis a unitary ( A,eA)-bimodule (and hence, AandeAare unitary also), the
condition “ AMeA̸={0}” is equivalent to condition “ M̸={0}”.6 DE FRANC ¸A AND SVIRIDOVA
Notice that, given a subalgebra IofAsuch that AIA̸={0},Iis a (minimal) two-sided ideal of A
iffIis an (irreducible) A-bimodule.
Now, let us define a quotient bimodule andhomomorphism of bimodules . Let Nbe a subbimodule
of an ( A,eA)-bimodule M. The quotient (A,eA)-bimodule M/Nis defined as follow:
i)M/N={m=m+N:m∈M}is a quotient vector space;
ii)am=amfor any a∈Aandm∈M;
iii)mb=mbfor any b∈eAandm∈M.
It is clear that amb=amb=amb=amb for any a∈A,b∈eAandm∈M. By the three above items,
we have that M/Nis an ( A,eA)-bimodule naturally.
Definition 2.3. LetAandeAbe two algebras, MandeMtwo(A,eA)-bimodules and φ:M−→eM
a linear transformation. We say that φis ahomomorphism of (A,eA)-bimodules ifφsatisfies
φ(am) =aφ(m)andφ(mb) =φ(m)bfor any a∈A,b∈eAandm∈M.
2.2.Graded Bimodules over Graded Algebras. LetAbe an F-algebra and Ga group. A G-
grading on Ais a decomposition Γ : A=L
g∈GAginF-vector subspaces Ag’s of Athat satisfy
AgAh⊆Aghfor all g, h∈G.
The group algebra FGhas a natural G-grading. In general, for any group G, any algebra Ahas a
G-grading, called trivial grading , defined by Ae=AandAg={0}for any g∈G\ {e}, where eis the
neutral element of G.
Definition 2.4. AG-graded algebra Ais said to be G-simple (orsimple graded , orminimal
graded ) ifA2̸={0}andAdoes not have proper G-graded ideals, i.e. if Iis a graded ideal of A,
then either I={0}orI=A. Moreover, assuming Abe unitary, Ais aG-division (ordivision G-
graded ) algebra if all its nonzero homogeneous elements are invertible in A, i.e. for any a∈S
g∈GAg,
a̸= 0, there exists a−1∈Asuch that aa−1=a−1a= 1.
Note that for any a∈S
g∈GAg,a̸= 0, its inverse a−1is also homogeneous of degree deg(a−1) =
(deg(a))−1. Observe also that if Ais a simple algebra, thus AisG-simple. For more details about
graded algebras (rings), we indicated the references [27, 28].
Let us now define a G-grading on an ( A,eA)-bimodule M, where AandeAare two G-graded algebras
andGis a group.
Definition 2.5. LetGbe a group, AandeAtwoG-graded F-algebras and Man(A,eA)-bimodule. A
G-grading on Mis a decomposition of Min a direct sum of F-subspaces MgofM,g∈G, satisfying
AgMh⊆Mghand MheAt⊆Mht, for any g, h, t ∈G. In this case, we say that Mis a G-graded
(A,eA)-bimodule .
Analogously to the case of graded algebras, for any group G, any bimodule Mhas a G-grading,
called trivial grading , defined by Me=MandMg={0}for any g∈G\ {e}, where eis the neutral
element of G. A special case in the study of the G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodules occurs when A=eA. Such
bimodules are called G-graded A-bimodules .
A subbimodule NofMis said to be a graded subbimodule ifN=L
g∈G(N∩Mg). Observe that a
subbimodule of a graded bimodule is graded iff it can be generated as a bimodule by its homogeneous
elements.
Definition 2.6. LetMbe a G-graded (A,eA)-bimodule. We say that Misirreducible graded (or
G-irreducible ) ifAMeA̸={0}, and Mdoes not have proper graded subbimodules. This means that
Mis an irreducible G-graded (A,eA)-bimodule iff AMeA̸={0}, and {0}and Mare the only graded
subbimodules of M.
By above definition, the condition AMeA̸={0}means that am˜a̸= 0 for some homogeneous elements
a∈A,m∈Mand ˜a∈eA. Obviously, for any irreducible G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodule M, we have
M=AmeAfor any nonzero homogeneous element m∈M. In fact, it is sufficient to see that N={m∈Irreducible Graded Bimodules over Algebras and a Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical 7
M:AmeA={0}}is a graded subbimodule of M, and to conclude that N={0}, because AMeA̸={0}
andANeA={0}, and so N̸=M.
Notice that, given a graded subalgebra IofAsuch that AIA̸={0},Iis a (simple) graded two-sided
ideal of AiffIis a (irreducible) graded A-bimodule.
Definition 2.7. LetMbe a G-graded (A,eA)-bimodule and Na proper graded subbimodule of M. We
say that Nis amaximal graded (orG-maximal ) subbimodule of MifM/Nis aG-irreducible (A,eA)-
bimodule. In other words, NisG-maximal in MiffNis proper and N+A{m}eA=Mfor any m∈M\N.
It is important to note that, since any graded subbimodule NofMis still a left (and also right)
graded submodule of M, any G-maximal (resp. G-irreducible) subbimodule NofMis either a left
G-maximal (resp. left G-irreducible) of Mor is contained in (resp. contains) some.
Now, given a graded subbimodule Nof a G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodule M, we have that the quotient
(A,eA)-bimodule M/Nis naturally a G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodule. In fact, since M=L
g∈GMgand
N=L
g∈G(N∩Mg), we have the quotient space Mg/(N∩Mg) is well defined, for any g∈G. It is easy
to see thatM
N=M
g∈GMg
N∩Mg,
and thus, M/Nis aG-graded ( A,eA)-bimodule, called graded quotient (A,eA)-bimodule .
Let us now define homogeneous homomorphisms andgraded homomorphisms of (A,eA)-bimodules.
Definition 2.8. LetGbe a group, AandeAtwoG-graded algebras, MandeMtwoG-graded (A,eA)-
bimodules, and φ:M→eMa homomorphism of (A,eA)-bimodules. We say that φis ahomogeneous

for any g∈G. A finite sum of
homogeneous homomorphisms of (A,eA)-bimodules is called a graded homomorphism of (A,eA)-
bimodules .
Observe that if φis a homogeneous homomorphism of degree h0, thus either h0belongs to center of
{g∈G:φ(Mg)̸={0}}inG, and hence, eMgh0=eMh0gfor any g∈G, orφ(Mg) ={0}when gh0̸=h0g.
Notice that any homogeneous homomorphism of G-graded is also a graded homomorphism. Not
always the kernel or image of a graded homomorphism is a graded subbimodule, but kernel and image
of any homogeneous homomorphism of graded bimodules are graded subbimodules. We write M∼=GeM
when two G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodules MandeMare homogeneously isomorphic, i.e. there exists a
homogeneous isomorphism ψ:M→eM.
Next, let us talk a little bit about chain conditions for graded bimodules.
Definition 2.9. LetGbe a group, AandeAtwoG-graded algebras and MaG-graded (A,eA)-bimodule.
We say that Misweak G-noetherian (resp. weak G-artinian ) if it satisfies the ascending (resp.
descending) chain condition (ACC) (resp. (DCC)) for graded subbimodules.
When Mis a G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodule which is weak G-noetherian and weak G-artinian at the
same time, then we say that “ Msatisfies both weak chain conditions ” instead of “ Msatisfies both
chain conditions for graded subbimodules ”.
Any finite dimensional G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodules and any irreducible G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodules
are examples of graded bimodules which satisfy both weak chain conditions.
Remark 2.10. LetMbe a G-graded (A,eA)-bimodule, where Gis a group, and AandeAare two G-
graded algebras. Since any graded subbimodule of Mis also a left graded submodule, we have naturally
that if Mis left G-noetherian (resp. G-artinian), thus Mis weak G-noetherian (resp. weak G-artinian).
The “right” case is analogous.

where each Nkis a maximal graded subbimodule of Nk+1, i.e.Nk+1
Nkis an irreducible graded (A,eA)-
bimodule for each k. In this case, we say that Mhas a weak graded composition series with length r,
and we denote by l(M)the smallest length of a weak graded composition series of M.
Obviously, any G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodule which has a graded composition series is finitely generated
(as a graded bimodule).
2.3.Matrix over a twisted group algebra. Here, let us define an important object in our study:
the twisted group algebras. As previously, Gdenotes a group and e∈Gits neutral element, Fa field,
andF∗=F\ {0}.
Definition 2.12. The mapping σ:G×G−→F∗which satisfies
σ(x, y)σ(xy, z) =σ(x, yz)σ(y, z)for all x, y, z ∈G
is called a 2-cocycle onGwith values in F∗. The set of all 2-cocycles from GintoF∗is denoted by
Z2(G,F∗).
Remark 2.13. Letσ:G×G−→F∗be a 2-cocycle on G. To prove that σ(x, e) =σ(e, y)for any
x, y∈G, it is enough to put y=ein Definition 2.12. From this, it follows that σ(x, e) =σ(e, x) =
σ(e, e)for any x∈G. Again in Definition 2.12, if we replace y=x−1andz=x, we can prove that
σ(x, x−1) =σ(x−1, x), for any x∈G.
Now, consider the group algebra FG. Observe that FGis an associative algebra with unity; if Gis
commutative (resp. finite), then FGis a commutative (resp. finite dimensional) algebra. Also, FGhas
a natural G-grading. Let us consider a more general situation.
Definition 2.14. LetGbe a group, Fa field, and σ:G×G−→F∗a2-cocycle on G. Consider the
F-vector space
Fσ[G] =

X
g∈Gαgηg:αg∈F, g∈G

,
where the set {ηg}g∈Gis linearly independent over F. Consider on Fσ[G]the multiplication which
extends by linearity the product ηgηh=σ(g, h)ηgh,g, h∈G. With this multiplication, Fσ[G]is an
algebra, called a twisted group algebra .
Observe that the equality in Definition 2.12 ensures that Fσ[G] is an associative algebra. Obviously,
ifσis the trivial 2-cocycle on G, i.e. σ(g, h) = 1 for any g, h∈G, thus Fσ[G] =FG. Furthermore, we
have that A=Fσ[G] isG-graded with the natural grading defined by Ag=spanF{ηg}, for each g∈G.
Remark 2.15. Note that Fσ[G]is a unitary algebra, where its unity is given by σ(e, e)−1ηe, since
σ(e, e) =σ(e, g) =σ(g, e)for any g∈G(by Remark 2.13). Moreover, Fσ[G]is a division graded
algebra, i.e. every nonzero homogeneous element of Fσ[G]has multiplicative inverse in Fσ[H]. Note
that dim(Fσ[G])<∞iffGis a finite group.
Now, let us present some results which will be our tools in the last part of this section.
Consider the algebra B=Mn(Fσ[H]) of all n×nmatrices over the twisted group algebra Fσ[H],
where His a subgroup of a group Gandσ∈Z2(H,F∗). We have that |H|<∞implies dim(B) =
n2|H|<∞. Fix an arbitrary k-tuple ξ= (g1, . . . , g k)∈Gk. The vector subspaces defined by Bg=
spanF{Eijηh∈B:g=g−1
ihgj},g∈G, define a G-grading on B. This G-grading is called canonical
elementary grading defined by ξ.

closed field F. Suppose that either char(F) = 0 orchar(F)is coprime with the order of each finite

Fσ[H]∼=Mk(Fσ[H]), where His a finite subgroup of Gandσ∈Z2(H,F∗). The G-grading on Mk(Fσ[H])

2.4.Group Characters. In this subsection, let us recall some definitions and properties of Group
Characters , which will be important for the development of this work. Although the results in this
section are well-known, we add them here so that this work is self-contained. Here, let us denote by
Gan arbitrary finite multiplicative group with identity element 1, Fa field, and GLn(F) the group of
invertible n×nmatrices over F.
Definition 2.17. Arepresentation of Gof degree nis a homomorphism of groups Tfrom Gto

if there exists a fixed SinGLn(F)such that T′(g) =ST(g)S−1, for any g∈G.
LetT:G→GLn(F) be a representation of a group G. We say that Tisreducible if there exist
representations T1:G→GLn1(F) and T2:G→GLn2(F) ofG, with n=n1+n2, such that
T(g) andT1(g)V(g)

are equivalent, for any g∈G, where V(g) is a matrix over Fof order n1×n2for each g∈G; otherwise,
then Tis anirreducible representation . For more details, see [8, 18, 22, 31].
Theorem 2.18 (Theorem 10.8 (Maschke), p.41, [8]) .LetGbe a finite group and T:G→GLn(F)
a representation of G. If char(F)∤|G|, then there exist irreducible representations T1, . . . , T n(not
necessarily non-equivalent) of Gsuch that T=T1+···+Tn.
Definition 2.19. LetGbe a group, and T:G→GLn(F)a representation of G. The character of

T(g). We say that ζis an irreducible character when Tis an irreducible representation. The set
of all the irreducible characters of Gis called dual ofG, and denoted by bG.

representations of GoverFwith characters ζandζ1, respectively. If char(F)∤|G|, then TandT1
are equivalent iff ζ=ζ1. In addition, if Fis an algebraically closed field, then the number of distinct
irreducible characters of Gis finite.
Proposition 2.21 (Orthogonality Relations, p.219-221, [8]) .LetFbe an algebraically closed field such
that char(F)∤|G|,Ga finite group, and ζ1, . . . , ζ sall the distinct characters of G. Then

iii)For each i= 1, . . . , s , the character ζiis irreducible iffP

The next result is a consequence of Proposition 2.21.
Theorem 2.22 (Theorem 9, p.25, [31]) .LetGbe a finite group, and Fan algebraically closed field
such that char(F)∤|G|. Then Gis abelian iff all the irreducible characters of Ghave degree 1.
A consequence of previous theorem is that if Gis finite abelian, then any irreducible character of
Gis a homomorphism of groups. In other words, if ζ:G→F∗is an irreducible character of G, then
ζ(gh) =ζ(g)ζ(h) for any g, h∈G.
The proposition below is a well-known result of Character Theory of Finite Group.
Proposition 2.23 (Exercise 3.3, p.26, [31]) .IfGis a finite abelian group and Fis an algebraically

Proof. Letk1, . . . , k nbe prime powers such that G∼=Ck1×···× Ckn, where Ckiis the (multiplicative)
cyclic group of order ki. It if easy to see that bG∼=bCk1×···× bCknand|Cki|=|bCki|for all i= 1, . . . , n .
Since χ(g) is an o(g)-th root of unity, for any character χofCkiand any g∈Cki, where o(g) is the
order of g, the result follows. □10 DE FRANC ¸A AND SVIRIDOVA
3.First results on Graded Bimodules
In this section, we present some generalizations of the well-known results of the module’s theory
over algebras.
LetMbe a G-graded left A-module. Considering eAan another G-graded algebra, we have that M
is a right eA-module with the trivial product, i.e. ma= 0 for any m∈Manda∈eA, and hence, M
is aG-graded ( A,eA)-bimodule naturally. Analogously, we can assume that a right eA-module is also
a (A,eA)-bimodule. Hence, we can prove for bimodules some results for left and right modules. We
show below some results for bimodules that are originally for left (or right) modules, whose proofs are
similar to the proofs for one-sided cases. Therefore, all issues of this sections are inspired by known
results of the theory of one-sided modules.
Lemma 3.1 (Isomorphism Theorems for Graded Bimodules) .LetGbe a group, AandeAtwoG-graded
algebras, and MaG-graded (A,eA)-bimodule.
i)IfM′is a G-graded (A,eA)-bimodule and ψ:M−→ M′is a homogeneous homomorphism of

Proof. The proof is adapted from Theorems 6.19, 6.20 and 6.21, [30], p.406. □
Lemma 3.2 (Correspondence Theorem for Graded Bimodules) .LetGbe a group, AandeAtwoG-
graded algebras and MaG-graded (A,eA)-bimodule. Suppose Nis a graded subbimodule of M. Then
any graded subbimodule of the quotient bimodule M/Nis of the form P/N={x+N:x∈P}, where P
is a graded subbimodule of Msuch that N⊂P⊂M. The correspondence between graded subbimodules
ofM/Nand graded subbimodules of Mwhich contain Nis a bijection.
Proof. The proof is adapted from Theorem 6.22, [30], p.407. □
Lemma 3.3. LetGbe a group, AandeAtwoG-graded algebras and MaG-graded (A,eA)-bimodule.
LetNbe a graded subbimodule of M. Then Mis weak G-artinian (resp. weak G-noetherian) iff Nand
M/Nare weak G-artinian (resp. weak G-noetherian).
Proof. The proof is adapted from Theorem 2, [29], p.41. □
Using the ideas of the previous lemma and Lemma 3.2, we can build a descending (or an ascend-
ing) chain of graded subbimodules with a special property. Consider a G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodule M.
Suppose Mis weak G-noetherian (resp. weak G-artinian). By the previous lemma, given a graded
subbimodule NofM, we have that NandM/Nare weak G-noetherian (resp. weak G-artinian). If M
is not G-irreducible, so there exists a G-maximal (resp. G-irreducible) subbimodule N1inM. If N1
(resp. M/N1) isG-irreducible, then M=N0⊋N1⊋N2={0}(resp. {0}=N0⊊N1⊊N2=M)
with Ni+1isG-maximal in Ni(resp. Ni+1/NiisG-irreducible), for i= 0,1. Otherwise, suppose that
N1(resp. M/N1) is not G-irreducible, and hence, there exists a nonzero graded subbimodule N2of
Msuch that N2⊊N1andN2isG-maximal N1(resp. N2⊋N1andN2/N1isG-irreducible). So, we
obtain the chain M=N0⊋N1⊋N2⊋N3={0}(resp. {0}=N0⊊N1⊊N2⊊N3=M). If N2
(resp. M/N2) isG-irreducible, it follows that Ni+1isG-maximal in Ni(resp. Ni+1/NiisG-irreducible),
fori= 0,1,2. Otherwise, using this process inductively we must obtain a descending chain (resp. an
ascending chain) of graded subbimodules
(2) M=N0⊋N1⊋N2⊋···⊋{0}(resp. {0}=N0⊊N1⊊N2⊊···⊊M),
such that Ni+1is maximal in Ni(resp. Ni+1/Niis irreducible), for i= 0,1,2, . . .. Notice that we use
Lemma 3.2 to ensure that if M/Niis not irreducible, then there exists a graded subbimodule Ni+1⊋Ni
such that Ni+1/Niis irreducible.Irreducible Graded Bimodules over Algebras and a Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical 11
Now, again by Lemma 3.3, it is easy to show that the finite direct sum (internal or external) of weak
G-noetherian (resp. weak G-artinian) ( A,eA)-bimodules is a weak G-noetherian (resp. weak G-artinian)
(A,eA)-bimodule. The proof of this fact can be made by induction over the number of summands and
recursively applying the Lemma 3.3.
Notice that given a homogeneous homomorphism of graded ( A,eA)-bimodules φ:M1→M2, ifM1is
weak G-noetherian (resp. weak G-artinian), then im(φ) and ker(φ) are weak G-noetherian (resp. weak
G-artinian) subbimodules of M2andM1, respectively, since ker(φ) is a graded subbimodule of M1(see
Lemma 3.3) and im(φ)∼=GM1/ker(φ) (see Lemma 3.1) is a graded subbimodule of M2.
Lemma 3.4. LetAandeAbe two G-graded algebras, and M=N+WaG-graded (A,eA)-bimodule. If N
andWare weak G-artinian (resp. weak G-noetherian) subbimodules of M, then Mis weak G-artinian
(resp. weak G-noetherian).
Proof. By Lemma 3.1, item (ii), we have that
M
W∼=GN+W
W∼=GN
N∩W.
Since Nis weak G-artinian (resp. weak G-noetherian), it follows from Lemma 3.3 thatN
N∩Wis weak
G-artinian (resp. weak G-noetherian). Again by Lemma 3.3, it follows that Mis weak G-artinian (resp.
weak G-noetherian), because WandM
W∼=GN
N∩Ware weak G-artinian (resp. weak G-noetherian). □
Lemma 3.5. LetAandeAbe two G-graded algebras, and MaG-graded (A,eA)-bimodule. Then Mis
weak G-noetherian (resp. weak G-artinian) iff every non-empty family Sof graded subbimodules of M
contains a maximal (resp. a minimal) graded subbimodule in the family, that is, a graded subbimodule
P∈Ssuch that if N∈SandN⊃P(resp. N⊂P), then N=P.
Proof. The proof is adapted from Proposition 5.33, [30], p.312. □
By the previous lemma, it is clear that any weak G-noetherian (resp. weak G-artinian) ( A,eA)-
bimodule which is not irreducible has some maximal (resp. minimal) proper graded subbimodule.
Lemma 3.6. LetAandeAbe two G-graded algebras, and MaG-graded (A,eA)-bimodule. Then Mis
weak G-noetherian iff every G-graded subbimodule of Mis finitely generated.
Proof. First, suppose that Mis weak G-noetherian. Let Nbe any nonzero graded G-subbimodule of
M. Consider the family SNof all the finitely generated graded subbimodules of N, which is obviously
non empty. Since Nis weak G-noetherian (by Lemma 3.5), there is W∈SNmaximal in SN, i.e. there
is noeW∈SNsuch that W⊊eW. Take any homogeneous element x∈N, and consider eW=W+A{x}eA.
Note that eWis finitely generated, and hence, eW∈SN. Because Wis maximal in SN, we conclude that
W=eW, and thus x∈Wfor any x∈N. Therefore, Nis finitely generated.
Now, assume that every G-graded subbimodule of Mis finitely generated. Consider an ascending
chain of G-subbimodules of Mgiven by
N1⊆N2⊆ ··· ⊆ Nk⊆ ··· .
Put N=S
k∈NNk, which is a G-subbimodule of M. By hypothesis, Nis finitely generated, and
hence, there exist x1, x2, . . . , x s∈N, homogeneous elements, such that N=A{x1, x2, . . . , x s}eA. Let
k1, k2, . . . , k s∈Nsuch that xi∈Nkifor all i= 1,2, . . . , k . Put k0=max{k1, k2, . . . , k s}. We have
that x1, x2, . . . , x s∈Nk0, and thus N⊆Nk0. It follows that Nl=Nk0for all l≥k0. Therefore, Mis
weak G-noetherian. □
Example 3.7. LetRbe the real field, and A=R[x1, x2, . . .]a polynomial algebra (with unit) in
infinitely many (commutative) variables. We have that Ais aZ-graded A-bimodule which is not Z-
noetherian, since the subbimodule A{x1, x2, . . .}AofAis graded and cannot be finitely generated.
We present below a result inspired by the Jordan-H¨ older Theorem (see Theorem 7.3 in [30], p.526).12 DE FRANC ¸A AND SVIRIDOVA
Lemma 3.8. LetMbe a G-graded (A,eA)-bimodule, where AandeAareG-graded algebras. Suppose
that Mhas a weak graded composition series with length r. Then any graded subbimodule NofMhas
a weak graded composition series, and any weak graded composition series of Nhas length at most r.
Proof. Let{0}=M0⊊M1⊊···⊊Mr=Mbe a weak graded composition series of Msuch that
r=l(M). Take Na graded subbimodule of M. For each i= 0,1, . . . , r , consider the graded subbimodule
Ni=N∩MiofN. Since Mi+1/Miis irreducible graded, it is easy to see that Ni+1/Ni∼=GMi+1/Mi
orNi=Ni+1for all i= 0,1, . . . , r −1. Hence, {Ni}iensures a weak graded composition series of N,
whose length l(N)≤r.
The proof of the second part of this lemma is an adaptation of the proof of Theorem 1 (Jordan-
H¨ older), [29], p.33. □
The previous lemma is a key tool to prove some results in this work. Next, we present an equivalence
between a graded bimodule having a weak graded composition series and satisfying both weak chain
conditions.
Lemma 3.9. LetAandeAbe two G-graded algebras, and MaG-graded (A,eA)-bimodule. Then Mhas
a weak graded composition series iff Mis weak G-noetherian and weak G-artinian.
Proof. First, suppose that Mhas a weak graded composition series with length r. By Lemma 3.8, any
graded subbimodule WofMalso has a weak graded composition series with length at most r, and
hence, Wis finitely generated, and so, by Lemma 3.6, we have that Mis weak G-noetherian. Now, let
us show that Mis weak G-artinian. Suppose that there exists a descending chain N1⊋N2⊋N3⊋···
of graded subbimodules of Mwhich is infinite. Since Mhas a weak composition series, without loss of
generality, we can assume that Ni+1is maximal in Ni, for all i∈ {1,2,3, . . .}(see Lemma 1 (Schreier),
[29], p.34). As any graded subbimodule of Mhas a weak graded composition series with length at
most r, let{0}=eNr+s⊊eNr+s−1⊊···⊊eNr=Nrbe a graded composition series of Nr, where
s−1 =l(Nr)≤r. Hence, we have that
{0}=eNr+s⊊eNr+s−1⊊···⊊eNr=Nr⊊Nr−1⊊···⊊N2⊊N1
is a weak graded composition series of N1, whose length is r+s−1. Thus, by Lemma 3.8, it follows
thatr+s−1≤r, and hence, s≤1. Consequently, either eNr+1={0}, and so Nris irreducible graded,
orNr={0}. Anyway, we conclude that Ns={0}for all s > r . Therefore, Mis weak G-artinian.
Reciprocally, assume that Mis weak G-noetherian and weak G-artinian. If Mis not irreducible
graded, consider F1the family of all the graded subbimodules NofM, with N̸=M. Since Mis weak
G-noetherian, by Lemma 3.5, there is N1∈F1maximal in F1. Note that N1is maximal in M. IfN1is
irreducible graded, M=N0⊋N1⊋{0}is a weak graded composition series of M. Otherwise, if N1is
not irreducible graded, consider F2the family of all the graded subbimodules PofN1, with P̸=N1.
Again by Lemma 3.5, there is N2∈F2maximal in F2. Note that N2is maximal in N1. Again, if N2is
irreducible graded, M=N0⊋N1⊋N2⊋{0}is a weak graded composition series of M. Otherwise,
the above process has to continue, and so, we can construct a descending chain
M=N0⊋N1⊋N2⊋N3⊋···
of graded subbimodules of M, where Ni+1is maximal in Ni, for all i= 0,1, . . .. Since Mis weak
G-artinian, there is s0∈Nsuch that Ns=Ns0for all s≥s0. Hence, we conclude that Ns={0}.
Therefore, M=N0⊋N1⊋N2⊋N3⊋···⊋Ns={0}is a weak graded composition series for M.□
An immediate consequence of the previous lemma is that if Mis aG-graded ( A,eA)-bimodule such
that Mhas a weak graded composition series, then Mis necessarily finitely generated. For the next
result, recall that any G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodule can be generated by its homogeneous elements.
Lemma 3.10. LetAandeAbe two finite dimensional G-graded F-algebras, and MaG-graded (A,eA)-
bimodule. If Mis finitely generated, then Mis weak G-artinian and weak G-noetherian.Irreducible Graded Bimodules over Algebras and a Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical 13
Proof. Suppose that S={x1, . . . , x n}is a subset of homogeneous elements of Msuch that M=ASeA.
Since ASeA=Pn
i=1A{xi}eA, to prove that Mis weak G-artinian and weak G-noetherian is enough to
prove that each A{xi}eAis weak G-artinian and weak G-noetherian (see Lemma 3.4). Fixed any x∈S,
let us show that A{x}eAis weak G-artinian and weak G-noetherian.
First, recall that A{x}eA=spanF{x}+Ax+xeA+AxeA. Now, since AandeAare finite-dimensional
F-algebras, consider nonzero homogeneous elements a1, . . . , a r∈Aandb1, . . . , b s∈eAsuch that A=
spanF{a1, . . . , a r}andeA=spanF{b1, . . . , b s}. It is easy to see that Ax=spanF{a1x, . . . , a rx}andxeA=
spanF{xb1, . . . , xb s}, and hence, AxandxeAhave finite dimensions. Finally, given any m∈AxeA, there
exist ˆ a1, . . . , ˆat∈Aandˆb1, . . . , ˆbt∈eAsuch that m= ˆa1xˆb1+···+ˆatxˆbt. Let λ11, . . . , λ tr, γ11, . . . , γ ts∈

and so, m∈spanF{ajxbl:j= 1, . . . , r, andl= 1, . . . , s }. Consequently, AxeA=spanF{ajxbl:j=
1, . . . , r, andl= 1, . . . , s }, and thus, AxeAhas a finite dimension. From this, it follows that

i.e.A{x}eAhas a finite dimension. Therefore, we conclude that A{x}eAis weak G-artinian and weak

By the previous result, given AandeAfinite dimensional G-graded F-algebras and MaG-graded

In [35], Theorem 11, P. V´ amos proved that, if Kis an extension field of Fsuch that Kis not finitely

Proof. First, by Lemmas 3.6 and 3.10, the items (i), (ii) and (iii) are equivalent. Already the equiva-
lence of (iii) and (iv) follows from Lemma 3.9. □
Corollary 3.12. LetGbe a group, H1and H2two finite subgroups of G, and Fσ1[H1]andFσ2[H2]
two twisted group algebras, with σi∈Z2(Hi,F∗). For each i= 1,2, consider Bi=Mni(Fσi[Hi])the
algebra of ni×nimatrices over Fσi[Hi]with a canonical elementary G-grading. Any finitely generated
G-graded (B1,B2)-bimodule satisfies both weak chain conditions.
Proof. Indeed, for each i= 1,2, we have that dim(Bi) =n2
i|Hi|<∞, since Hiis finite, and so, B1
andB2have finite dimensions. By Theorem 3.11, the affirmation is immediate. □
3.1.A decomposition for graded bimodules of finite dimension. We say that a left (resp.
right) A-module Mis a 0-leftA-module (resp. 0 -right A-module ) ifAM={0}(resp. MA={0});
Mis a left (resp. right) faithful ifaM={0}(resp. Ma={0}) to imply a= 0, where a∈A. It is
important to note that, for any a=P
g∈GaginA, “aM={0}implies a= 0” iff “ agM={0}implies
ag= 0, for any g∈G”. The “right” case is analogous.14 DE FRANC ¸A AND SVIRIDOVA
Theorem 3.13. LetGbe a group, AandeAtwo unitary algebras with G-gradings, and MaG-graded
(A,eA)-bimodule, not necessarily unitary. If Mhas a finite dimension (as vector space), then Mcan be
decomposed as
M=M00⊕M10⊕M01⊕M11,
where Mij’s are G-graded (A,eA)-bimodules such that:
i)forr= 0,1,M0ris a0-leftA-module and M1ris a unitary left G-graded A-module;
ii)fors= 0,1,Ms0is a0-righteA-module and Ms1is a unitary right G-graded eA-module;
iii)M11is a unitary G-graded (A,eA)-bimodule.
In addition, if A(resp. eA) is simple graded, then M1r(resp. Mr1) is faithful on the left (resp. on the
right), for r= 0,1.
Proof. Letiandˆibe the units of AandeA, respectively, and consider the applications L, R :M−→M
defined by L(x) =ixandR(x) =xˆifor all x, y∈M, respectively. Note that LandRare homogeneous
homomorphisms of G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodules such that L2=LandR2=R, since i2=i∈Aeand
ˆi2=ˆi∈eAe. Hence, ker(L),im(L),ker(R) and im(R) are G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodules. On the other
hand, we conclude that 0 ,1∈Fare the only eigenvalues of LandR. So, we have that LandR
are diagonalizable, since their minimal polynomials can be written as the product of linear factors
(see [17], Theorem 6.4.6, p.204). Notice that R◦L=L◦R, and hence, it follows that ker(R) and
im(R) are invariant by L, and ker(L) and im(L) are invariant by R. From this, it is easy to check that
VR
0=ker(R) and VL
0=ker(L) are the eigenspaces of RandLassociated with 0, respectively, and
VR
1=im(R) and VL
1=im(L) are the eigenspaces of RandLassociated with 1, respectively.

areG-graded ( A,eA)-bimodules. Let us show that
(3) M=M00⊕M01⊕M10⊕M11.
LeteM=P
r,s=0,1Mrs. We have that
M10={x∈M:x=ix, xˆi= 0},M01={x∈M:x=xˆi,ix= 0},
M11={x∈M:x=ixˆi},M00={x∈M:ix=xˆi= 0}.
From this, if x10+x01+x11+x00= 0, where xrs∈Mrs, then
0 =i(x10+x01+x11+x00)ˆi=ix11ˆi=x11,
0 =i(x10+x01+x11+x00) =ix10+ix11=x10+x11,
0 = ( x10+x01+x11+x00)ˆi=x01ˆi+x11ˆi=x01+x11,
and hence, x11=x10=x01=x00= 0, and thus, eM=L
r,s=0,1Mrs. On the other hand, by Rank-
Nullity Theorem (see [17], Theorem 3.1.2, p.71), it follows that M=ker(R)⊕im(R) =ker(L)⊕im(L),
since dimFM<∞andker(R)∩im(R) =ker(L)∩im(L) ={0}. Take any x∈M. There exist x0∈ker(L)
andx1∈im(L) such that x=x0+x1, and hence, there exist x00, x10∈ker(R) and x01, x11∈im(R)
such that x0=x00+x01andx1=x10+x11. Notice that x00, x01∈ker(L), since 0 = ix0=ix00+ix01
andker(L)∩im(L) ={0}. Similarly, x10, x11∈im(L), since x10+x11=x1=ix1=ix10+ix11, and
sox10−ix10=ix11−x11, but ker(R)∩im(R) ={0}. Therefore,
x=x00+x01+x10+x11∈M00⊕M01⊕M10⊕M11.
This finishes the proof of (3).
Now, to show that Mrs’s satisfy items i),ii)andiii), it is enough to see that, since Mrs’s are
G-graded ( A,eA)-bimodules and iandˆiare the units of AandeA, respectively, a=ai=ia=iaiand
b=ˆib=bˆi=ˆibˆifor any a∈Aandb∈eA, and so ax= (ai)x=a(ix) and xb=x(ˆib) = ( xˆi)bfor any
a∈A,b∈eAandx∈M. Thus, the items i),ii)andiii)follow from definition of Mrs’s.
Finally, suppose A(resp. eA) simple graded. To obtain a contradiction, suppose that there exists
some nonzero homogeneous element a0∈A(resp. a0∈eA) such that a0M1r={0}(resp. Mr1a0=Irreducible Graded Bimodules over Algebras and a Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical 15
{0}). By the simplicity of A(resp. eA), we have that A=Aa0A(resp. eA=eAaeA), and hence,
AM1r= (Aa0A)M1r⊆(Aa0)M1r=A(a0M1r) ={0}(resp. Mr1eA=Mr1(eAa0eA)⊆Mr1(a0eA) =
(Mr1a0)eA={0}), which contradicts the items i)andii)of this theorem. Therefore, we conclude that
M1r(resp. Mr1) is faithful on the left (resp. on the right), for i= 0,1. □
By above theorem (and its proof), it is possible to prove that if AandeAare simple graded, then
M11is a “faithful bimodule ”, i.e. given a∈Aandb∈eA,aMb={0}iffa= 0 or b= 0.
The next result shows the importance of studying and describing the subbimodule M11ofM.
Corollary 3.14. Assume the same assumptions of Theorem 3.13. If Mis a unitary (A,eA)-bimodule,
then M=M11.
Proof. Supposing that Mis a unitary bimodule, we have that x=ix=xˆi=ixˆifor any x∈M, and
thus,
J00⊕J01⊕J10=i(J00⊕J01⊕J10)ˆi={0}.
Therefore, the result follows. □
Motivated by Theorem 3.13 and Corollary 3.14, in the next sections, let us study unitary bimodules
(over (semi)simple algebras).
A particular case of the previous theorem is given when Mis a graded algebra, in special, Mis an
ideal of the algebra A. To finally this section, let us present some results in this line.
Corollary 3.15. LetAbe an algebra with a G-grading, Ba graded subalgebra and Na graded (two-
sided) ideal, both of A. Suppose that Bis unitary and Nhas a finite dimension. Then N=L
i,j=0,1Nij,
where the Nij’s are as in Theorem 3.13 and satisfy NrqNqs⊆Nrsfor all r, p, q, s ∈ {0,1}, with
NrpNqs={0}forp̸=q.
Proof. Obviously Nis aG-graded B-bimodule, and so we can write N=L
i,j=0,1Nijas in Theorem
3.13. Now, being ibe the unit of B, since Ahas an associative product, we have that ( xi)y=x(iy)
for any x, y∈A, and hence, from the definitions of the Nij’s it follows that
N00N11=N00N10=N01N00=N10N11=N11N01=N11N00={0},
N00N00=spanF{x·y∈N:ix=xi= 0,iy=yi= 0, x, y∈N} ⊆N00,
N00N01=spanF{x·yi∈N:ix=xi= 0,iy= 0, yi=y, x, y ∈N} ⊆N01,
N10N00=spanF{ix·y∈N:ix=x, xi= 0,iy=yi= 0, x, y∈N} ⊆N10,
N10N01=spanF{ix·yi∈N:ix=x, xi= 0,iy= 0, yi=y, x, y ∈N} ⊆N11,
N01N10=spanF{xi·iy∈N:ix= 0, xi=x,iy=y, yi= 0, x, y∈N} ⊆N00,
N01N11=spanF{xi·iyi∈N:ix= 0, xi=x,iy=yi=y, x, y ∈N} ⊆N01,
N11N10=spanF{ixi·iy∈N:ix=xi=x,iy=y, yi= 0, x, y∈N} ⊆N10,
N11N11=spanF{ixi·iyi∈N:ix=xi=x,iy=yi=y, x, y ∈N} ⊆N11,
and this ensures the our affirmation. □
Corollary 3.16. Under the same hypotheses of Corollary 3.15, let ibe the unit of B. Ifi∈ ZA(Nh)
(the center of NhinA) for some h∈G, then Nh= (N00)h⊕(N11)h. In addition, i∈ Z(N)(center of
NinA) iff N=N00⊕N11.
Proof. By Theorem 3.13, we can write
N=M
g∈G((N00)g⊕(N01)g⊕(N10)g⊕(N11)g) =M
g∈G
i,j∈{0,1}(Nij)g.
Now, suppose i∈ ZA(Ah) for some h∈G, i.e. iah=ahifor all ah∈Ah. In particular, for
anyxh∈Nh⊆Ah, we have ixh=xhi. Since Nh= (N00)h⊕(N10)h⊕(N01)h⊕(N11)h, where16 DE FRANC ¸A AND SVIRIDOVA
N00={z∈N:iz= 0 = zi},N10={x∈N:ix=x, xi= 0}andN01={y∈N:yi=y,iy= 0}, it
follows that N10=N01={0}. Therefore, i∈ ZA(Ah) for h∈Gimplies Nh= (N00)h⊕(N11)h.
Consequently, if i∈ Z(A), it follows that Nh= (N00)h⊕(N11)hfor any h∈G, and so we conclude
that
N=M
g∈GNg=M
g∈G((N00)g⊕(N11)g) =N00⊕N11.
On the other hand, suppose N=N00⊕N11. Take any z=x+y∈Nwith x∈N00andy∈N11.
Since ix= 0 = xiandiy=y=yi, we have that iz=i(x+y) =ix+iy=xi+yi= (x+y)i=zi, and
the result follows. □
4.Graded Bimodules over Simple Graded Algebras
In this section, let us exhibit the main results of this work: a description of irreducible graded
bimodules and a (special) decomposition of finitely generated graded bimodules.
LetGbe a group, Ha finite subgroup of G,σ∈Z2(H,F∗) a 2-cocycle, and B=Mn(Fσ[H]) with
the canonical elementary G-grading defined by an n-tuple ( g1, . . . , g n)∈Gn, i.e.B=L
g∈GBg, where
Bg=spanF{Eijηh∈B:g−1
ihgj=g}. Recall that Bis unitary with unity 1 B=σ(e, e)−1Pn
i=1Eiiηe,
and the set {Eijηh∈B:i, j= 1, . . . , n, andh∈H}is a homogeneous basis of B. Let us consider
Ma unitary G-graded B-bimodule. In what follows, let us define elements in Mwhose product with
(homogeneous) elements of Bis similar to the product in B.
Fix a nonzero homogeneous element w0∈M. Since Mis unitary, it follows that ηeEi0i0w0Ej0j0ηe̸= 0
for some i0, j0∈ {1, . . . , n }, and hence, ηgEri0w0Ej0sηh̸= 0 for any r, s∈ {1, . . . , n }andg, h∈H
(because ηeEii=σ(g, g−1)−1EijηgEjiηg−1for any g∈Handi, j= 1, . . . , n ). Observe that all
elements ηgEri0w0Ej0sηh’s are homogeneous. Without loss of generality, we can consider the element
ηeE11w0E11ηe̸= 0 instead of w0. Given any g∈Handi, j∈ {1, . . . , n }, define the element
(4) mg
ij:=X
h∈Hσ(h, h−1g)−1ηhEi1w0E1jηh−1g,
where each ηgEr1w0E1sηh̸= 0 for any r, s∈ {1, . . . , n }andg, h∈H.
When mg
ij̸= 0 for some g∈Handi, j∈ {1, . . . , n }, observe that mg
ijhas behaviour similar to Eijηg
in relation to the product by elements of B, i.e. for any r, s∈ {1, . . . , n }andt∈H, we have

ijErsηt=δjrσ(g, t)mgt

where δij=0,ifi̸=j
1,ifi=jis the Kronecker delta. In fact, take any t∈Handr, s∈ {1, . . . , n }. It
is obvious that Ersηhmg
ij= 0 when s̸=i, and mg
ijErsηh= 0 when r̸=j. Now, if s=i, we have

rj,Irreducible Graded Bimodules over Algebras and a Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical 17
since σ(t, h)σ(th,(th)−1tg) =σ(t, g)σ(h,(th)−1tg) for any h, g, t ∈H(see Definition 2.12). And if
r=j, we have
mg

=σ(g, t)mgt
is,
since σ(h, h−1g)σ(g, t) =σ(h, h−1gt)σ(h−1g, t) for any h, g, t∈H(see Definition 2.12).
Another peculiarity of mg
ij’s is that if mg
ij̸= 0 for some i, j∈ {1, . . . , n }andg∈H, then mhg
lj=
σ(h, g)−1Eliηhmg
ij̸= 0 and mgh
il=σ(g, h)−1mg
ijEjlηh̸= 0 for any h∈Handl∈ {1, . . . , n }, since
mg
ij= (σ(e, e)−1σ(h−1, h)−1Eilηh−1Eliηh)mg
ij= (σ(e, e)−1σ(h−1, h)−1Eilηh−1)(Eliηhmg
ij),
and
mg
ij=mg
ij(σ(e, e)−1σ(h, h−1)EjlηhEljηh−1) = (mg
ijEjlηh)(σ(e, e)−1σ(h, h−1)Eljηh−1).
From this, we can deduce that mg
ij̸= 0 for some i, j∈ {1, . . . , n }andg∈Hiffmh
rs̸= 0 for any
r, s∈ {1, . . . , n }andh∈H.
Besides that, it is easy to prove that the element iM:=σ(e, e)−1Pn
i=1me
ii∈Msatisfies biM=iMb
for any b∈B.
Notice that when either deg(w0)∈ Z(G) orH⊂ Z(G), we have that mg
ijis a homogeneous element
ofMfor any g∈H, and i, j∈ {1, . . . , n }. Particularly, when deg(w0)∈ Z(G), it follows that
mg
ij∈Mg−1
iggjdeg(w0)=Mdeg(w0)g−1
iggjfor any g∈H,i, j= 1, . . . , n . By these observations, it follows
that the linear transformation ψ:B→Mwhich extends the map Eijηg7→mg
ijis a homogeneous
homomorphism of B-bimodules of degree deg(w0) when deg(w0)∈ Z(G).
Remark 4.1. LetGbe a group, Ha finite subgroup of G,Fa field, σ∈Z2(H,F∗), and B=Mn(Fσ[H])
with a canonical elementary G-grading. Let Mbe a unitary G-graded B-bimodule. Fix a nonzero
homogeneous element m0∈M, and, as in (4), define
mg
ij=X
h∈Hσ(h, h−1g)−1Ei1ηhm0E1jηh−1g,
for any g∈H, and i, j= 1, . . . , n . Recall that Ersηhmg

ijErsηh=δjrσ(g, h)mgh

for any h, g∈Handi, j, r, s ∈ {1. . . , n}, where δijis the Kronecker delta; and mg
ij̸= 0 for some
g∈Handi, j∈ {1, . . . , n }implies that mh
rs̸= 0for any h∈Handr, s∈ {1, . . . , n }.
Suppose mg
ij̸= 0for some g∈Handi, j∈ {1, . . . , n }, and Fis an algebraically closed field such
that char(F) = 0 . Take N=spanF{mg
ij:g∈H, i, j= 1, . . . , n }.Affirmation: ifdeg(m0)∈ Z(G),
then Nis an irreducible G-graded B-subbimodule of M. Indeed, consider the linear transformation
ψ:B−→Nwhich extends the map Eijηg7→mg
ij. By (5), it follows that ψis a homomorphism of
B-bimodules. Notice that ψis surjective and homogeneous of degree deg(m0). Since Bis an irreducible
graded B-bimodule (see Theorem 2.16), it follows that ψis injective ( ker(ψ)is a graded subbimodule
ofB). We conclude that ψis a homogeneous isomorphism of G-graded B-bimodules. Therefore, Nis
an irreducible graded B-bimodule. In particular, if Mis irreducible graded, then M=N.
In the above remark, it is important to comment that not always mg
ij̸= 0 for some g∈Hand
i, j∈ {1, . . . , n }. In the next result, let us present other cases of irreducible G-graded B-bimodules
(possibly when mg
ij= 0 for some g∈Handi, j∈ {1, . . . , n }), which are not isomorphic to Bas graded
B-bimodules.18 DE FRANC ¸A AND SVIRIDOVA
Proposition 4.2. LetGbe a finite abelian group, Fan algebraically closed field with char(F) = 0 ,
andB=Fσ[G]a twisted group algebra. Let Mbe an irreducible unitary G-graded B-bimodule. There
exist a nonzero homogeneous element w0∈Mand a character χ:G→F∗satisfying M=Bw0and
ηgw0=χ(g)−1w0ηgfor any g∈G.
Proof. Fix a nonzero homogeneous element m0∈M, and hence, we have that M=Bm0B. Let
χ1, . . . , χ sbe all distinct irreducible characters of G(see Corollary 2.20). Since GandbG={χ1, . . . , χ s}
are isomorphic groups (see Proposition 2.23), we have that s=|G|. For each i∈ {1, . . . , s }, define
wχi=X
h∈Gσ(h, h−1)−1χi(h)ηhm0ηh−1.
Let us show that Bwχi=wχiBandBm0B=Ps
i=1Bwχi, for all i∈ {1, . . . , s }. Observe that BwχiB
is a graded subbimodule of M, since m0is a homogeneous element, and Gis abelian.
Take any ηt∈B, and i= 1, . . . , s . We have that
ηtwχi=ηt X

h∈Gσ((th)−1, th)−1χi(h)ηthm0η(th)−1!
ηt=χi(t)−1wχiηt,
since σ(t, h)σ((th)−1, th) =σ(h, h−1)σ((th)−1, t) for any h, t∈G(it is enough to make x= (th)−1,
y=tandz=hin Definition 2.12, and σ(h, h−1) =σ(h−1, h) by Remark 2.13), and χi(ht) =χi(h)χi(t)
for any h, t∈G(see Theorem 2.22). From this, it follows that Bwχi=wχiBfor all i= 1, . . . , s .
Now, write G={g1, . . . , g s}. Since the matrix
[χ]:=
χ1(g1)χ1(g2)··· χ1(gs)

(this is a consequence of Proposition 2.21), we have that ηhm0ηh−1∈Ps

Hence, we can conclude that ηgm0ηh∈Ps

Therefore, we conclude that M=Bwχfor some irreducible character χofG, since each Bwχiis a

Below, let us show that, given a finite dimensional simple G-graded algebra A, any unitary G-
graded A-bimodule Mwhich satisfies both weak chain conditions can be written as a finite direct sum
of irreducible G-graded A-subbimodules in the form Aw, where w∈MandwA=Aw.Irreducible Graded Bimodules over Algebras and a Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical 19
Theorem 4.3. LetGbe a group, Ha finite abelian subgroup of G, andFan algebraically closed field
such that char(F) = 0 . Consider MaG-graded unitary B-bimodule, where B=Mn(Fσ[H])with a
canonical elementary G-grading and σ∈Z2(H,F∗). If Mis irreducible graded, then there exists a
nonzero homogeneous element w∈Msatisfying M=Bw, such that Bw=wB.
Proof. Ifn= 1, then the result follows from Proposition 4.2.
Assume that n >1. Let χ1, . . . , χ sbe all the distinct irreducible characters of H, where H∼=bH=
{χ1, . . . , χ s}. Fix a nonzero homogeneous element m0∈Mandi= 1, . . . , s . From the discussion in the
third paragraph of this chapter (text above of equality (4)), we can assume, without loss of generality,
thatm0=ηeE11ˆmE11ηefor some nonzero ˆ m∈M, and so Ep1ηgw0ηhE1q̸= 0 for any p, q∈ {1, . . . , n }

ˆwχi=sX

hence, Bˆwχi= ˆwχiB, for all i= 1, . . . , s .

we conclude that M=Bˆwχfor some irreducible character χofH. □
Observing the proof of Theorem 4.3, and considering the subset β={Eijηh:i, j= 1, . . . , n, h ∈H}
ofB, we have that wb=γbbw̸= 0 for any b∈β, where γb∈F∗. This means that any element of B
commutes with any element of Mup to a scalar.
Below, let us rewrite the previous theorem from its proof.
Corollary 4.4. Assume the same assumptions of Theorem 4.3. If Mis irreducible graded, then there
exist a nonzero homogeneous element m0∈Mand a character χ:H→F∗such that the element
defined by
ˆwχ=nX

satisfies M=Bˆwχ, and Epqηtˆwχ=χ(t)−1ˆwχEpqηtfor all p, q∈ {1, . . . , n }andt∈H.
Proof. It is immediate of the proof of Theorem 4.3, and of Proposition 4.2. □20 DE FRANC ¸A AND SVIRIDOVA
Observe that the element ˆ wχin Corollary 4.4 is homogeneous, and satisfies Bˆwχ= ˆwχB. Recall
thatχis an irreducible character of H.
Corollary 4.5. LetGbe an abelian group, Fan algebraically closed field with char(F) = 0 , and Aa
finite dimensional algebra over Fwith a G-grading. If Ais simple graded, then any irreducible G-graded
A-bimodule Mis equal to a G-graded A-bimodule Aw, for some homogeneous element w∈Mwhich
satisfies Aw=wA.
Proof. LetMbe an irreducible G-graded A-bimodule. By Theorem 2.16, there exist a finite subgroup
HofG,σ∈Z2(H,F∗), and a G-graded isomorphism (of algebras) ψfrom AinMn(Fσ[H]), where
Mn(Fσ[H]) is graded with a canonical elementary G-grading. Put B=Mn(Fσ[H]), and consider the
(two-sided) action from BinMdefined by b·m7→ψ−1(b)mandm·b7→mψ−1(b). From this, Mis also a
G-graded B-bimodule. Since Bis unitary and A=ψ−1(B), it follows that Mis an irreducible G-graded
unitary B-bimodule. By Theorem 4.3, there exists a homogeneous element w∈Msatisfying M=Bw,
such that Bw=wB. Therefore, because Bw=ψ−1(B)w=AwandwB=wψ−1(B) =wA, the
result follows. □
Theorem 4.6. LetGbe a group, Ha finite abelian subgroup of G,Fan algebraically closed field with
char(F) = 0 ,σ∈Z2(H,F∗), and B=Mn(Fσ[H])with a canonical elementary G-grading. Let Mbe
G-graded unitary B-bimodule. If Mis finitely generated (as bimodule), then Mcan be written as a
finite direct sum of irreducible graded subbimodules of the form Bw, where w∈Mis a homogeneous
element which satisfies wB=Bw.
Proof. By Corollary 3.12 and Lemma 3.9, we can obtain a finite sequence
(6) {0}=M0⊊M1⊊···⊊Mp−1⊊Mp=M,
where Mi’s are G-graded B-subbimodules of Msuch that Mi+1/Miis an irreducible G-graded B-
bimodule for i= 0,1, . . . , p −1.
By induction on p, let us show that there exist homogeneous elements w1, . . . , w p∈Msuch that
M=Lp
i=1BwiwithBwi=wiB̸= 0 for all i= 1, . . . , p .
First, suppose p= 1. Hence, M=M1with M/M0∼=GM G-irreducible. It follows from Theorem 4.3
that there exists a nonzero homogeneous element w1∈M1such that M1=Bw1with w1B=Bw1̸= 0.
Assume that the result is true for p=d > 1, i.e. there exist nonzero homogeneous elements
w1∈M1\M0, w2∈M2\M1, . . . , w d∈Md\Md−1satisfying
Md=Bw1⊕Bw2⊕ ··· ⊕ Bwd,
where each wiB=Bwi̸= 0 is an irreducible graded subbimodule, for all i= 1, . . . , d .
Now, for p=d+ 1, notice that Md+1=Md+BwB(by maximality of MdinMd+1) for any
w∈Md+1\Md,w̸= 0. Since Md+1/Mdis irreducible graded, by Corollary 4.4, there exist a nonzero
homogeneous element w0∈Md+1\Mdand a character χ:H→F∗such that ˆ wχdefined by
ˆwχ=nX
i=1 X
h∈Hχ(h)σ(h, h−1)−1ηhEi1w0E1iηh−1!

satisfies Md+1/Md=B( ˆwχ+Md), and Eijηg( ˆwχ+Md) = χ(g)−1( ˆwχ+Md)Eijηgfor all i, j∈
{1, . . . , n }andg∈H. Let us consider wd+1:= ˆwχ. As B(wd+1+Md)̸= 0 + Md, there ex-
istsEklηg∈Bsuch that Eklηgwd+1=χ(g)−1wd+1Eklηg/∈Md. From this, using the equality
Eklηg=σ(gh−1, h)−1σ(g, e)−1Ekiηgh−1EijηhEjlηe, for any i, j∈ {1, . . . , n }andh∈H, it is im-
mediate that Eijηhwd+1=χ(h)−1wd+1Eijηh/∈Mdfor any i, j∈ {1, . . . , n }andh∈H. Consequently,
we have that Bwd+1B=Bwd+1=wd+1BandBwd+1∩Md={0}, and so Md+1=Md⊕Bwd+1. By
Isomorphisms Theorem (see Theorem 3.1), we have that
Md+1
Md=Md⊕Bwd+1
Md∼=GBwd+1
Md∩Bwd+1=Bwd+1
{0}∼=GBwd+1,Irreducible Graded Bimodules over Algebras and a Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical 21
asG-graded B-bimodules. Therefore, we proved that Bwd+1is an irreducible G-graded B-subbimodule
ofMsuch that wd+1B=Bwd+1, and hence,
Md+1=Md⊕Bwd+1=Bw1⊕ ··· ⊕ Bwd⊕Bwd+1,
where each Bwiis an irreducible graded subbimodule of Msatisfying Bwi=wiB̸={0}for all
i= 1, . . . , d + 1. Furthermore, by induction, the result is proved. □
Under the same conditions of Theorem 4.6, take w1, . . . , w l∈Msuch that M=Ll
k=1Bwk, with
Bwk=wkBirreducible graded for all k= 1, . . . , l . By Corollary 4.4 (or by the proof of Theorem
4.3, and Proposition 4.2), for all k= 1, . . . , l , there exist a map χk:H→F∗(χkis the irreducible
character associated with wk) satisfying
Eijηgwk=χk(g)−1wkEijηg
for any g∈Handi, j= 1, . . . , n . In addition, considering the map φ:Nl×H→F∗defined by
φ(k, g) =χk(g)−1, where Nl={1, . . . , l}, we have that Eijηgwk=φ(k, g)wkEijηg, for any k= 1, . . . , l ,
g∈Handi, j= 1, . . . , n .
To conclude this section, let us present a result that combines all the previous results.
Theorem 4.7. LetFbe an algebraically closed field, Gan abelian group and Aa finite dimensional
algebra over Fwith a G-grading. Suppose that char(F) = 0 , and AisG-simple. If Mis a finitely
generated G-graded A-bimodule, then there exist nonzero homogeneous elements w1, w2, . . . , w n∈M
such that
M=Aw1⊕Aw2⊕ ··· ⊕ Awn,
where wiA=Awi̸= 0for all i= 1,2, . . . , n , and AwiisG-irreducible.
Proof. By Theorem 2.16, there exists a G-graded isomorphism ψfromAinMn(Fσ[H]), for some finite
subgroup HofGandσ∈Z2(H,F∗), and Mn(Fσ[H]) with a canonical elementary G-grading. Put
B=Mn(Fσ[H]). We have that Mis aG-graded A-bimodule via left action b·m=ψ−1(b)·mand right
action m·b=m·ψ−1(b) for any b∈Bandm∈M. Since Bis unitary, it follows that Mis unitary,
and hence, we have the same conditions of Theorem 4.6. Therefore, the result follows. □
Note that Theorem 4.7 simplifies the way in which the elements of a finitely generated G-graded A-
bimodule Mcan be presented. A priori , being x1, . . . , x m∈Ma generating set of M, given any y∈M,
there are aij, bij∈A, with i= 1, . . . , m andj= 1, . . . , k i, such that y=Pm
i=1Pki
j=1aijxibij
. Using
the previous theorem, we can write only y=a1w1+···+anwnfor some a1, . . . , a n∈A. Therefore,
Theorem 4.7 plays an important tool when it is necessary to know the structure/properties of a given
(graded) bimodule.
4.1.Graded Bimodules over Semisimple Graded Algebras. Suppose that Ais a unitary alge-
bra. If ϵ∈Ais a central idempotent element, i.e. ϵ∈ Z(A) with ϵ2=ϵ, then 1 −ϵ∈Ais also a central
idempotent element of Asuch that ϵand (1 −ϵ) are orthogonal when ϵ̸= 0, i.e. ϵ(1−ϵ) = (1 −ϵ)ϵ= 0.
Therefore, given x∈A, notice that x=xϵ+x(1−ϵ), and hence, it is not difficult to see that
A=Aϵ⊕A(1−ϵ). This decomposition is called the Peirce decomposition ofArelative to ϵ. Nat-
urally, we can extend this definition to nidempotent elements of A, as follows. Let ϵ1, . . . , ϵ n∈Abe
distinct central orthogonal idempotent elements. Without loss of generality, suppose that 1 =Pn
i=1ϵi.
Given x∈A, we have x=x1 =Pn
i=1xϵi, and hence, A=Aϵ1⊕···⊕ Aϵnis the Peirce decomposition
ofArelative to ϵ1, . . . , ϵ n.
We remember that a graded algebra Ais called left (resp. right) semisimple graded when there
exist simple graded left (resp. right) ideals Ar’s,r∈I(not necessarily finite), such that A=L
r∈IAr.
Analogously, we define a two-sided semisimple graded algebra, in the sense of two-sided ideals. More
precisely, we say that the graded algebra Aisweak semisimple graded if there exist simple graded
two-sided ideals Ar’s,r∈I(not necessarily finite), such that A=L
r∈IAr. Obviously, this last
sum is finite when Ais unitary. In fact, there exist ir1∈Ar1,. . .,irn∈Arn(not all zero) such that
1A=Pn
j=1irj∈Ln
j=1Arj. Put I0={r1, . . . , r n}, and take any y∈S
k∈I\I0Ak. Since 1 Ax=x1A=x22 DE FRANC ¸A AND SVIRIDOVA
for any x∈A, we have that 1 Ay=y, but this implies that y=y·1A=yPn
j=1irj
=Pn
j=1(yirj)
which belongs toL
l∈I0Al, because the Al’s are graded two-sided ideals of A. From this, it follows
that y= 0, since M
l∈I0Al!\
M
k∈I\I0Ak
={0}. Therefore, A=Ln
r=1Arwhen Ais unitary. It is
not difficult to prove that the algebras Ar’s are unitary.
Theorem 4.8. LetAandeAbe two G-graded unitary algebras and Ma unitary G-graded (A,eA)-
bimodule. If AandeAare weak semisimple graded, then there exist central orthogonal idempotent
elements i1, . . . ,ip∈Aandˆi1, . . . ,ˆiq∈eAsuch that M=p,qM
r,s=1irMˆis,A=pM
r=1ArandeA=qM
s=1eAs, where
Ar=AirandeAs=eAˆisareG-simple two-sided ideals. In addition, each irMˆisis either equal to zero
or a faithful G-graded (Ar,eAs)-bimodule.
Proof. Since AandeAare unitary and weak semisimple graded, there exist simple graded ideals
A1, . . . ,Ap⊂AandeA1, . . . ,eAq⊂eAsuch that A=Lp
r=1Ar,eA=Lq
s=1eAs, and we can take
central orthogonal idempotent elements i1, . . . ,ip∈Aandˆi1, . . . ,ˆiq∈eAsuch that i=Pp
r=1irand
ˆi=Pq
s=1ˆis, where ir∈Arandˆis∈eAs. Note that Ar=ArirandeAs=eAsˆis.
Since Mis unitary, we have M=iMˆi. PuteM=Pp,q
r,s=1irMˆis. Since the ir’s and ˆis’s are orthogonal
elements, it follows that eM=Lp,q
r,s=1irMˆis. Obviously, eM⊆M. On the other hand, for any x∈M, we
have x=ixˆi= (Pp
r=1ir)xPq
s=1ˆis
=Pp,q
r,s=1irxˆis∈eM.Hence, M⊆eM, and so M=eM.
Now, it is immediate that irMˆisis aG-graded ( Ar,eAs)-bimodule for all r= 1, . . . , p ands= 1, . . . , q ,
because the Ar’s and eAs’s are graded ideals of AandeA, respectively. And by the simplicities of Ar’s
andeAs’s, it follows that irMˆisis a faithful bimodule when it is nonzero. □
By Theorem 4.8, a particular case is given when there exist r0∈ {1, . . . , p }ands0∈ {1, . . . , q }such
thatAr0andAs0are finite-dimensional and graded isomorphic (as graded algebras). Hence, if the
basis field Fis algebraically closed with char(F) = 0, Gis abelian, and ir0Mˆis0is finitely generated,
then there exist homogeneous elements d1, . . . , d k(r0,s0)∈Msuch that ir0Mˆis0=Lk(r0,s0)
j=1 Ar0dj, where
Ar0djis aG-simple Ar0-bimodule with Ar0dj=djeAs0for all j= 1, . . . , k (r0,s0). In fact, assume that
ψ:Ar0→As0is a graded isomorphism of graded algebras, and put V(r0,s0)=ir0Mˆis0. Consider the
right action on V(r0,s0)given by x·a=xψ(a) for any x∈V(r0,s0)anda∈Ar0. Hence, we can see
V(r0,s0)as an Ar0-bimodule. The result follows from Theorem 4.7.
Corollary 4.9. LetGbe an abelian group, Fan algebraically closed field with char(F) = 0 ,Aa finite
dimensional unitary F-algebra with a G-grading, and MaG-graded unitary A-bimodule. If Ais weak
semisimple graded and Mis finitely generated, then there exists a decomposition of Mof the formLp
i,j=1Mij,p∈N, where each Mijis either equal to zero or a faithful G-graded A-bimodule, and each
Miican be written as a finite sum of irreducible G-graded A-subbimodules of the form Aw, for some
homogeneous element w∈Mwhich satisfies Aw=wA.
Proof. It is immediate from Theorems 4.8 and 4.7. □
It is important to comment that Mijpresented by the previous corollary is of the form irMis, as
in Theorem 4.7. Observe that if isM=Misfor some s= 1, . . . , p , thus Mis={0}for any i̸=s. In
addition, we have the following result.
Corollary 4.10. Under the assumptions of Theorem 4.8, suppose that eA=AandMis a (two-sided)
ideal of A. Then M=Lp
s=1isMisiffi1, . . . ,ip∈ ZA(M).
Proof. By Theorem 4.8 and Corollary 4.9, we have M=Lp
r,s=1Mrs, where Mrs=isMir. Suppose
is∈ ZA(M) for any s= 1, . . . , p . Hence, we can conclude that isMir={0}forr̸=s, since isxir=
(isxir)is= 0 for all x∈Mandr̸=s. From this, M=Lp
s=1isMis. Therefore, we have the result. □Irreducible Graded Bimodules over Algebras and a Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical 23
5.A Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical
The goal of this section is to present one application of the previous results concerning the Jacobson
radical of A, where Ais aG-graded finite dimensional algebra over a field F. Here, let us use some
of the main results of this work, for example the Theorems 4.6 and 4.8, to give a description of the
Jacobson radical Jof a finite dimensional algebra Awith some grading over a group Gin terms of the
concept of the Peirce decomposition and of your semisimple part B. For more details about Jacobson
radical, see [16, 21].
In [34], Sviridova presented a generalization of Theorem of Wedderburn-Malcev for algebras graded
by a (finite abelian) group. She described, in suitable conditions, any finite dimensional graded algebras
as a direct sum of a maximal semisimple graded subalgebra and its Jacobson radical, which is also
graded. More precisely, Sviridova proved:
Lemma 5.1 (Lemma 2, [34]) .LetGbe a finite abelian group, and Fan algebraically closed field of
characteristic zero. Any finite dimensional G-graded F-algebra Ais isomorphic as G-graded algebra to
aG-graded F-algebra of the form
(7) A′= 
Mk1(Fσ1[H1])× ··· × Mkp(Fσp[Hp])
⊕J.
Here the Jacobson radical J=J(A)ofAis a graded ideal, and B=Mk1(Fσ1[H1])×···× Mkp(Fσp[Hp])
(direct product of algebras) is the maximal graded semisimple subalgebra of A′,p∈N∪ {0}. The G-
grading on Bl=Mkl(Fσl[Hl])is the canonical elementary grading defined by some kl-tuple (θl1, . . . , θ lkl)∈
Gkl, where Hlis a subgroup Gandσ∈Z2(Hl,F∗)is a2-cocycle.
From this, since the algebras Mki(Fσi[Hi])’s are well known (see [5]), it is interesting to present
some properties (when possible) of the (graded) ideal J, as well as its connection with the algebras
Mki(Fσi[Hi])’s. In the next result, let us exhibit a description of the Jacobson radical of a finite
dimensional graded algebra, which is a consequence of Theorem 3.13, Corollary 3.15, Theorem 4.8,
Corollary 4.9, and Theorem 2.16.
Theorem 5.2. LetGbe a group and A=B⊕Ja finite dimensional algebra with a G-grading, where
Bis a maximal semisimple G-graded subalgebra of A, and J=J(A)is the Jacobson radical and a
graded ideal of A. Then Jcan be decomposed as
J=J00⊕J10⊕J01⊕J11,
where Jij’s are G-graded B-bimodules such that:
i)forr= 0,1,J0ris a0-leftB-module and J1ris a left G-graded faithful B-module;
ii)fors= 0,1,Js0is a0-right B-module and Js1is a right G-graded faithful B-module;
iii)JrqJqs⊆Jrsfor all r, p, q, s ∈ {0,1}, with JrpJqs={0}forp̸=q.
Moreover, if B=Mk1(Fσ1[H1])× ··· × Mkp(Fσp[Hp]),Gis finite abelian, and Fis an algebraically
closed field with char(F) = 0 , then following statements are true:
iv)J11=Lp
s,r=1irJ11is, where each irJ11isis aG-graded (Br,Bs)-bimodule, where B=Lp
i=1Bi
withBi=Mki(Fσi[Hi]). In addition, irJ11is̸= 0implies that irJ11isis a faithful left Bi-module
and a faithful right Bj-module;
v)For each s= 1, . . . , p , there exist nonzero homogeneous elements ds,1, . . . , d s,rs∈isJ11issuch
that the G-graded vector space Ns=spanF{ds,1, . . . , d s,rs}satisfies isJ11is=BsNs. The ele-
ments ds,i’s satisfy bds,i=γs,i(b)ds,ib̸= 0for any nonzero b∈βs, and i= 1, . . . , r s, where
γs,i∈F, and βs={Elsjsηhs∈Bs:ls, js= 1, . . . , k s, hs∈Hs}is the canonical homoge-
neous basis of Bs=Mks(Fσs[Hs]). Moreover, for each i= 1, . . . , r s, we have that Bsds,iis a
G-simple Bs-bimodule.
Now, let Abe an algebra satisfying the same assumptions of Lemma 5.1, and hence, consider A
with a decomposition equal to (7). This means that
A= 
Mk1(Fσ1[H1])× ··· × Mkp(Fσp[Hp])
⊕J,24 DE FRANC ¸A AND SVIRIDOVA
where k1, . . . , k p∈N,H1, . . . , HpG,σ1∈Z2(H1,F∗), . . . , σ p∈Z2(Hp,F∗), and J=J(A) is the
Jacobson radical of A. Furthermore, supposing that the conditions of Corollary 4.10 are verified, we
have that J=J00⊕J11where J11=i1Ji1⊕ ··· ⊕ ipJip. Since each ir, the unity of the Mkr(Fσr[Hr]),
commutes with A, it is easy to see that
(8) A∼=G(Mk1(Fσ1[H1])⊕i1Ji1)× ··· × 
Mkp(Fσp[Hp])⊕ipJip
×J00.
Hence, without loss of generality, we can assume that A=A1×···× Ap×J00, where Ar=Br⊕Jr, with
Br=Mkr(Fσr[Hr]) and Jr=irJir. Therefore, we can deduce some (or perhaps several) properties
ofAfrom studying each algebra Arand each Ar-bimodule Jr. By Theorem 5.2, it follows that
each algebra Aris unitary, where each Jrhas a decomposition in a finite direct sum of irreducible
graded subbimodules of the form Arw, for some nonzero homogeneous element w∈Jrwhich satisfies
Arw=wAr, and J00is anA1× ··· × Ap-bimodule which is 0-left and 0-right (as one-sided module).
5.1.An application in PI-Theory. LetGbe a group and Aa finite dimensional F-algebra with a
(G×Z2)-grading. The Grassmann Envelope ofA, denoted by EG(A), is defined by
EG(A) = (A0⊗E0)⊕(A1⊗E1),
where E=E0⊕E1is an infinitely generated non-unitary Grassmann algebra. Record that Grassmann
algebra Eis theF-algebra generated by elements e1, e2, e3, . . ., such that eiej=−ejei, for all i, j∈N,
where char(F) = 0. Naturally EisZ2-graded with E0=spanF{ei1ei2···ein:nis even }, and E1=
spanF{ej1ej2···ejm:mis odd }. Note that EG(A) is an ( A0⊗E0)-bimodule, and
EG(A) =M
g∈G 
(A(g,0)⊗FE0) + (A(g,1)⊗FE1)
defines a G-grading on EG(A). In addition, being Ba (G×Z2)-graded subalgebra of A, it is easy to
see that EG(B) is a ( G×Z2)-graded subalgebra of EG(A).
The next theorem, due to I. Sviridova, gives the positive answer to the well-known Specht’s Prob-
lem for graded varieties of graded associative algebras in characteristic zero. Recall that Specht’s
Problem asks whether, given any algebra A, any set of polynomial identities of Ais a consequence of
a finite number of identities of A. For more details, as well as an overview, about Specht’s Problem,
see [6].
Record that a GT-ideal of F⟨XG⟩is a graded (two-side) ideal of F⟨XG⟩that is invariant under all
graded endomorphisms of F⟨XG⟩. It is well known that the set of all G-graded polynomial identities
of aG-graded PI-algebra over a field Fis aGT-ideal of F⟨XG⟩.
Theorem 5.3 (Theorem 2, [34]) .LetFbe an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and G
any finite abelian group. Any GT-ideal of graded identities of a G-graded associative PI-algebra over
Fcoincides with the ideal of G-graded identities of the G-graded Grassmann envelope of some finite
dimensional G×Z2-graded associative F-algebra.
Now, assume that Ais a finite dimensional G×Z2-graded algebra as in (8), i.e. A=A1×···× Ap×J00,
where As=Bs⊕Js, with Bs=Mks(Fσs[Hs]) and Js=isJis. We have that
EG(A) =EG(A1× ··· × Ap×J00) =EG(A1)× ··· × EG(Ap)×EG(J00),
andEG(As) =EG(Bs)⊕EG(Js). Remember that B=B1× ··· × Bpis a maximal semisimple graded
subalgebra of AandJ(A) =J00×J11is the Jacobson radical of A, where J11=J1×···× JpandJ00is
aB⊕J11-bimodule which is 0-left and 0-right (as one-sided module). From this, and by Theorem 5.3,
to study any graded variety W(of graded associative algebras in characteristic zero), it is important to
study the Bs-bimodule Js, as well as the algebras EG(Js) and EG(J00). Recall that a G-graded variety
Wis a family of G-graded (associative) algebras which satisfy all the graded polynomial identities of
a given subset S⊂F⟨XG⟩.
On the other hand, in [10], De Fran¸ ca and Sviridova proved that, in finite grading, Aeis nilpotent
iffAis nilpotent (see [10], Theorem 3.9, p.237). Consequently, considering E=E0⊕E1andJ=J0⊕J1
with their Z2-gradings, since E0is commutative and J0is nilpotent (because Jis so), we have thatIrreducible Graded Bimodules over Algebras and a Pierce Decomposition of the Jacobson Radical 25
 
EG(J)
0=J0⊗FE0is nilpotent, and hence, it follows that EG(J) is nilpotent, whose nilpotency index
nd(EG(J)) is at most 2 ·nd(J). In particular, the algebras EG(Js)’s and EG(J00) are nilpotent with
nilpotency indices at most 2 ·nd(J).
Finally, assume As=Bs⊕Js, with Bs=Mks(Fσs[Hs]) and Js=isJis. By Theorem 5.2, item (v),
there exist ds,1, . . . , d s,rs∈Jssuch that Js=Lrs
i=1Bsds,i. So, we have that

Thus, to study EG(J11), we can to analyze EG(Bsds,i) =M
j∈Z2ds,i(Bs)j⊗FEls,i+j, for all s= 1, . . . , p
andi= 1, . . . , r s, where degZ2(ds,i) =li. Therefore, the decomposition presented in Theorem 5.2 can
be an important tool to study EG(J11), and, consequently, help to provide a description of EG(J) and
ofEG(A), as well as of any graded variety Wof graded associative algebras in characteristic zero.
Let us finalize this work with the following result, which is a consequence of the observations above.
Proposition 5.4. LetFbe an algebraically closed field with char(F) = 0 , and Ga finite group.
LetWbe the G-graded variety generated by subset S=
y(e), z(g)
:g∈G	
ofF⟨XG⟩. If G=
Zp, with gcd(p,2) = 1 , then any G-graded algebra of Wsatisfies the (ordinary) polynomial identity
[x1, x2, x3][x4, x5, x6]···[xn−2, xn−1, xn]∈F⟨X⟩for some n∈N.
Proof. From the observations above, there exists a finite dimensional G×Z2-graded algebra Awhich
satisfies W=varG 
EG(A)
, and hence, we can write EG(A) =EG(A1)× ··· × EG(Ap)×EG(J00), where
eachAs=Mks(Fσs[Hs])⊕JsandJ(A) =J1× ··· × Jp×J00. Since EG(A)eis central in EG(A), it is
easy to see that k1=···=kp= 1, and so As=Fσs[Hs]⊕Jsfor all s= 1, . . . , p .
On other the hand, as G=Zp, where pand 2 are coprime, we have that G×Z2is isomorphic to
Z2p. Hence, for any subgroup HofG×Z2, it follows that any 2-cocycle σ∈Z2(H,F∗) is symmetric,
i.e. σ(g, h) = σ(h, g) for any g, h∈H(for a proof of this fact, see [9], Corollary 1.2.8 , p.28).
Consequently, the algebras Fσs[Hs]’s are commutative. Observe that EG(Ar)EG(As) =EG(Ar)EG(J00) =
EG(J00)EG(Ar) ={0}for all r, s= 1, . . . , p ,r̸=s. Now, for any i= 0,1 and g, h, t∈G, we have that

(As)(g,0)⊗FE0,(As)(h,i)⊗FEi
⊆
(Fσs[Hs])(g,0),(Js)(h,i)
⊗FEi+
(Js)(g,0),(Fσs[Hs])(h,i)
⊗FEi
+
(Js)(g,0),(Js)(h,i)
⊗FEi
⊆(Js)(gh,i)⊗FEi⊆EG(Js),
and since
(As)(g,1)⊗FE1,(As)(h,1)⊗FE1
⊆(As)(gh,0)⊗FE0, it follows that

(As)(g,1)⊗FE1,(As)(h,1)⊗FE1
,(As)(t,i)⊗FEi
⊆
(As)(gh,0)⊗FE0,(As)(t,i)⊗FEi
⊆EG(Js).
From this, as EG(As) =L
g∈G 
(As)(g,0)⊗FE0+ (As)(g,1)⊗FE1
, we conclude that
EG(As),EG(As)
⊆
EG(Js), for all s= 1, . . . , p . Therefore, since EG(J00) and EG(Js) are subalgebras of EG(J) for all
s= 1, . . . , p , and EG(J) are nilpotent, the result follows. □
