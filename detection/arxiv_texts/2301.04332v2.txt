Abstract
We apply an unconstrained formulation of bosonic higher spi n ﬁelds to study interac-
tions of these ﬁelds with a bosonic ﬁeld using new method for t he deformation procedure.
It is proved that local vertices of any order containing one h igher spin sﬁeld and arbi-
trary number of scalar ﬁelds and being invariant under origi nal gauge transformations are
described with the help of one local totally symmetric ( s−2)-rank tensor of scalar ﬁelds.
This tensor is explicitly constructed for particular cases related to cubic vertices for spin
sand vertices of an arbitrary order for spin s= 4.
Keywords: deformation procedure, higher integer spin ﬁelds, local vertices

11 Introduction
Over the past forty years, the construction of interacting highe r spin ﬁelds has attracted in-
creasing interest due to important obtained results and numerous unsolved problems that arise
in this sphere of activity [1, 2, 3, 4]. Main results and understanding h ave been achieved in
studies of cubic vertices [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] using diﬀe rent approaches (deformation
procedure in the BV formalism [15, 16], BRST construction [17], light-c one formalism [18])2.
Constructions of quartic vertices [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] req uire more eﬀorts and lead to the
non-locality problem in the high spin theory. A widely used method for c onstructing interac-
tion vertices in a deformation scheme embedded in the BV formalism [1 5, 16] is the Noether
procedure (see, for instance, [8, 9, 30] and references therein ).
Recently, the new method based on systematic use of anticanonica l transformations in the
BV-formalism [31, 32] to obtain a new approach for solutions to the d eformation procedure has
been proposed [33, 34, 35]. In fact, this method opens a new way in c onstructions of gauge
models with interactions between ﬁelds. Among achievements of new method there are models
containing quartic and quintic vertices for massless spin 3, massive v ector and scalar ﬁelds
[36, 37, 38] as well as cubic vertices for massless spin 4, massive vec tor and scalar ﬁelds [39].
All these models are described in an exact and closed form in terms of local functionals of ﬁnite
orders in ﬁelds which are invariant under original gauge transforma tions.
In the present paper, we are going to extend results of papers [3 6, 37, 38, 39] to the case of
massless integer spin sﬁelds using general statements of the new method.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, an unconstrained fo rmulation of initial
action for massless integer spin and scalar ﬁelds is introduced. In se ction 3, general conditions
of anticanonical transformationsleading to gaugeinvariance of loc al part ofdeformed action are
derived. Section4isdevotedtoeliminating allauxiliaryﬁeldstoobtainc onstrainedformulation
for interactions of massless spin sﬁeld with arbitrary number of scalar ﬁelds. In section 5, two
examples of vertices for model under consideration are presente d. In section 6, concluding
remarks are given.
The DeWitt’s condensed notations [40] are systematically used. The right functional deriva-
tives are marked by special symbols ” ←”. Arguments of any functional are enclosed in square
brackets [ ], and arguments of any function are enclosed in parent heses, ( ).
2 Unconstrained action
The new method to the deformation procedure is formulated within t he BV-formalism, which
operates with gauge theories of unconstrained ﬁelds. Massless int eger high spin ﬁelds in the
Fronsdal theory [41] with spin s >3 are satisﬁed to double traceless conditions. For these cases,
direct application of the new method ia not possible. Fortunately, th ere exists an unconstrained
formulation for massless integer high spin ﬁelds [42] that allows us to a pply the new method.
The action for such ﬁelds within the unconstrained formulation has t he form

2Recently a supersymmetric extension in constructionsof cubic ver tices [19, 20, 21] and description of related
aspects [22, 23] have been proposed.

Λµ1µ2···µs−1=∂µϕµµ1µ2···µs−1−∂(µ1Fµ2µ2···µs−1) (2)

We are going to construct interactions of massless integer spin sﬁelds with a real scalar
ﬁeldφ=φ(x). We assume that the initial action has the form
S0[A] =S0[ϕ,F,α,λ (2),λ(4)]+S0[φ], (3)

3 Gauge-invariant deformations
Now, we consider possible deformations of initial action using the pro cedure which is ruled out
by the generating functions hi(A) [33]. Here, we restrict ourself by the case of anticanonical
transformationsactingeﬀectively inthesector ofﬁelds ϕµ1···µsandFµ1···µs−2oftheinitialtheory.

In construction of suitable generating functions hµ1···µs

we have to take into account the dimensions of quantities involved in t he initial action S0[A]

From Eq. (11) it follows that the matrix ( M(−1))i
j(A) can be found explicitly and in the sector
of ﬁeldsϕ,φ,Freads

Here,Eµ1···µsν1···νsare elements of the unit matrix in the space of symmetric s-rank tensors. In
particular, the presentation (12) means that in process of defor mation of the initial action the
gauge transformations (6) do not deform. In turn, the deforme d action
δ/tildewideS[A] = 0 (13)
should be invariant under original gauge transformations (6). As a result, for the model under
consideration we found explicit description of deformed action and g auge symmetry.
Consider now the local part of action Sint[A] (10),

4In fact, the action S1loc[A] depends on ﬁelds ϕ,φ,Fonly. Due to the locality of original gauge
symmetry and gauge invariance of the deformed action (13), the a ctionS1loc[A] should be
invariant under original gauge transformations as well,
δS1loc[A] = 0. (15)

at least two partial derivatives,
Kµ1µ2···µs=∂(µ1∂µ2Rµ3···µs)(17)
whereRµ1···µs−2is a local totally symmetric (s-2)-rank tensor. Then, the equation (16) rewrites

the equation (16) describing the gauge invariance of local part of t he deformed action will be

describes in exact and closed form of a local gauge invariant model c ontaining (among others)

whereξµ1···µs−1are arbitrary functions of space-time coordinates. Moreover, w e prove that
all arbitrariness in special anticanonical transformations leading in the initial model to the
existence of local part of the deformed action invariant under orig inal gauge transformations is
described by one generating function Rµ1···µs−2(φ).
54 Eliminating auxiliary ﬁelds
Usually in high spin theory interactions between ﬁelds which include at le ast one ﬁeld with spin

conditions. Mainconcreteresults inthisdirectionarerelatedtocub icvertices obtainedinlinear
approximation with respect to the deformation parameter (see, f or example, [5, 6, 7, 43, 44]).
The bridge between the standard approach and new method exists if one eliminates all
auxiliary ﬁelds appearing in the unconstrained formulation with the he lp of the equations of
motion for the initial action. They are

In this limit the action S0[ϕ,F,α,λ (2),λ(4)] (1) reduces to the Fronsdal action [41],

of the Fronsdal theory. In what follows we will use the notation ” partial on−shell” for the
result of eliminating auxiliary ﬁelds from the deformed unconstrained action.
65 Special cases of vertices
It is remarkable fact that any gauge-invariant interaction betwee n massless spin sﬁeldϕand
any number of scalar ﬁelds φis described by one ( s−2)-rank tensor Rµ1···µs−2(φ) in a simple
enough way (21) using the unconstrained formulation [42] for new m ethod [33]. Eliminating
auxiliary ﬁelds leads to the similar situation when mentioned above inter action is deﬁned by the
tensorRµ3···µs
0(φ) in the form (27). As a general result, for gauge theories under c onsideration
solutions to the problem of suitable deformations leading to local gau ge-invariant interactions
have an unique form. Modeling an explicit form of local tensors Rµ1···µs−2(φ) we arrive at the
explicit structure of vertices due to (21). These vertices will be au tomatically invariant under
original gauge transformations. Then we can reproduce the corr esponding results to the partial
on-shell due to (28). Below we are going to demonstrate some spec ial cases of vertices obtained
in this way.
5.1 Cubic vertices ∼ϕφφfor arbitrary spin s
We begin construction of consistent interactions for the case of c ubic vertices because they
belong to the simplest class of interactions in gauge theories. It is cle ar that function Rµ3···µs(φ)
should be at least quadratic in ﬁeld φand we restrict ourself by the quadratic dependence in
scalar ﬁeld of this function. To reproduce tensor structure of Rµ3···µs(φ) we have to use partial
derivatives ∂µand the metric tensor ηµνof Minkowski space-time. The minimum number
of partial derivatives cannot be less than s−2. Let us use the minimal number of partial
derivatives in construction of Rµ3···µs(φ). Then, the more general form of Rµ3···µs(φ) reads
Rµ3···µs(φ) =c0φ ∂µ3···∂µsφ+ms/summationdisplay
k=1ck∂(µ3···∂µk+2φ ∂µk+3···∂µs)φ+

whereci, di(i= 0,1,...,m s) are constants having coinciding dimensions, dim( c0) = dim(d0) =
dim(ci) = dim(di),(i= 1,2,...,m s). In Eq. (31) the notation
ms=/bracketleftigs
2/bracketrightig
−1+(−1)s
2(32)
is used. Here [ a] denotes the integer part of number a. Constructed cubic vertices (21) with
the help of (31) form a (2 ms+ 1)- parameter family of interactions between integer spin s
and scalar ﬁelds when vertices contain sderivatives. Notice that on this stage there are cubic
vertices involving auxiliary ﬁelds as well, ∼Fφφ.
Of special interest is related with consideration of cubic vertices on the partial on-shell
because usually description of interactions with higher spin ﬁelds is pe rformed in terms of the
double trace restrictions. They are described by action (27) with u sing the function
Rµ3···µs
0(φ) =c0φ ∂µ3···∂µsφ+ms/summationdisplay
k=1ck∂(µ3···∂µk+2φ ∂µk+3···∂µs)φ. (33)
These vertices∼ϕφφbelong to ms-parameter family of interactions with minimal number of
derivatives equal to s.
75.2 Vertices of any order for massless spin 4 ﬁeld
Minimal value of spin when one needs to use the unconstrained formu lation for higher spin
ﬁelds to apply the new method in constructing interactions is equal t os= 4. The more general
form of function Rµν(φ) responsible for cubic interactions reads
Rµν(φ) =c1∂µ∂νφ φ+c2∂µφ ∂νφ+d1ηµν/squareφ φ+d2ηµν∂ρφ ∂ρφ. (34)
In this case the action (21) can be written in the form
S1loc[ϕ,φ,F] = 8/integraldisplay
dx/bracketleftig
∂λ∂σϕµνλσ−2/squareFµν−2∂ρ∂µFρν/bracketrightig
Rµν(φ). (35)
This action belongs to a three-parameter family of interactions bet ween massless spin 4 and
scalar ﬁelds. Passing to the partial on-shell is performed with the h elp of function
Rµν
0(φ) =c1∂µ∂νφ φ+c2∂µφ ∂νφ (36)
with the following result for action (27)

In its turn this action belongs to one-parameter family of interactio ns. This conﬁrms the result
obtained in [39].
It is not so hard to extend the obtained result for vertices of any o rder in scalar ﬁelds. To
do this it is enough to choice the function Rµν
(n)(φ) responsible for desired interactions in the
form
Rµν
(n)(φ) =Rµν(φ)φn−2, n= 3,4,..., (38)
whereRµν(φ) is deﬁned in (34). The corresponding action is

6 Discussion
In the present paper studies of models which include high spin ﬁelds int eracting with matter
ﬁelds and admit explicit and closed descriptions have been continued. Construction of these
models is based on applications of the new method [33, 34, 35] to the d eformation procedure
8for gauge theories [15, 16]. First examples were related to massless spin 3 ﬁelds when the orig-
inal gauge actions belonged to the class of ﬁrst-stage reducible th eories in the terminology of
BV-formalism [31, 32]. On this way it was proved that cubic vertices fo r interacting spin 3 ﬁeld
with scalar and massive vector ﬁeld being invariant under original gau ge transformations were
forbidden while quartic vertices can be explicitly constructed [36, 37 ]. Later on, for the ﬁrst
time in the history of the high spin theory quintic vertices describing lo cal interactions between
spin 3 ﬁeld and scalar and vector ﬁelds in exact form were found [38]. A ll found vertices with
massless spin 3ﬁeld [36, 37,38] hadanunique formoflocalfunctiona ls which were invariant un-
der original gauge transformations. Next step in constructions o f consistent interactions within
the new method was made in [39] where the case of massless spin 4 ﬁeld interacting with scalar
ﬁeld was studied. It was found that local non-trivial cubic vertices invariant under original
gauge transformations in both unconstrained and constrained se ttings can be constructed but
in comparison with the spin 3 ﬁelds the interactions contained arbitra riness. In more inter-
esting constrained (without auxiliary ﬁelds) description this arbitra riness was deﬁned by one
parameter. This conclusion was supported in Sec. 5 of the present study when it was proved
that vertices of any order for interactions of one massless spin 4 ﬁ eld with any number of scalar
ﬁelds in constrained description depend on one parameter.
Main eﬀorts of the present studies were concentrated on the der ivation of general conditions
allowing gauge invariant interactions of massless integer spin sﬁelds with scalar ﬁeld. It was
required to use the unconstrained formulation [42] of the Fronsda l theory [41] in the framework
of new method [33]. We considered a special form of anticanonical tr ansformations which
allowedustoarriveattwoimportantproperties: a)thedeformatio nsoftheoriginalgaugeaction
will be nontrivial, b) the original gauge symmetry will be preserved du ring the deformations. It
was proved that the deformation of local part of deformed action was ruled by one ( s−2)-rank
tensor of scalar ﬁelds leading to simple enough explicit form of vertice s (22), (24). In turn,
eliminating all auxiliary ﬁelds led to the formulation of the vertices in ter ms of double traceless
spin ﬁelds of the Fronsdal theory (27), (28). General results we re illustrated by two examples.
The ﬁrst one was devoted to explicit construction of cubic vertices which describe interacting
massless integer spin sﬁelds with scalar ﬁeld using assumption about minimal number (equal
tos) of partial derivatives in vertices. Existing arbitrariness in the con strained description was
described by msconstants (32). With an increase in the value of the spin, the arbitr ariness in
vertices also proportionally increased. The second example presen ted construction of vertices
of any order describing interactions of one massless spin 4 ﬁeld with a ny number of scalar ﬁelds.
Constrained presentation of these vertices used one parameter only. Here, it is interesting to
note that after construction of models with quintic vertices [38], in the high spin theory local
gauge invariant vertices of any order are introduced.
Results obtained in the present study can be easily extended to mor e general models in-
cluding additional ﬁelds, for example, massive vector ﬁeld Aµwhen the initial theory (3) can
be extended by the action

, Fµν=∂µAν−∂νAµ (42)
for free massive ﬁeld Aµ, andthe function Rµ3···µsdeﬁning special anticanonical transformations
will depend onﬁelds φandAµ. Forexample, local vertices describing interactions of one integer
spinsﬁeld with scalar ﬁeld and s−4 massive vector ﬁelds are generated with the help of the
following function
Rµ1···µs−2(A,φ) =c1∂µ1∂µ2Aµ3Aµ4···Aµs−2φ+c2∂µ1Aµ2∂µ3Aµ4Aµ5···Aµs−2φ+
+c3∂µ1Aµ2Aµ3Aµ5···Aµs−3∂µs−2φ+c4Aµ1Aµ2Aµ5···Aµs−4∂µs−3∂µs−2φ+

+d3ηµ1µ2Aµ3Aµ4···Aµs−2/squareφ+d4ηµ1µ2∂ρAµ1Aµ2···Aµs−4ηµs−3µs−2∂ρφ.(43)
9In fact, there exist a seven-parameter family of vertices invarian t under original gauge trans-
formations. Passing in (43) to the partial on-shell leads to the fun ction
Rµ1···µs−2
0(A,φ) =c1∂µ1∂µ2Aµ3Aµ4···Aµs−2φ+c2∂µ1Aµ2∂µ3Aµ4Aµ5···Aµs−2φ+
+c3∂µ1Aµ2Aµ3Aµ5···Aµs−3∂µs−2φ+c4Aµ1Aµ2···Aµs−4∂µs−3∂µs−2φ (44)
responsible for a three-parameter family of local vertices.
Finally, we can state that all vertices containing one massless intege r spin ﬁeld interacting
with any number of massive vector and scalar ﬁelds admit a closed and exact description in
terms of local functionals invariant under original gauge transfor mations.
