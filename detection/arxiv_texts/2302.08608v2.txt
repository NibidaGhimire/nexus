ELENA KIM AND ROBERT KOIRALA
Abstract. We study ℓ∞norms of ℓ2-normalized eigenfunctions of quantum cat maps. For
maps with short quantum periods (constructed by Bonechi and de Bi` evre in [ 4]) we show
that there exists a sequence ofeigenfunctions uwith/bardblu/bardbl∞/greaterorsimilar(logN)−1/2. For generaleigen-
functions we show the upper bound /bardblu/bardbl∞/lessorsimilar(logN)−1/2. Here the semiclassical parameter
ish= (2πN)−1. Our upper bound is analogous to the one proved by B´ erard in [ 2] for
compact Riemannian manifolds without conjugate points.
1.Introduction
In this paper, we build on an existing body of work that examines the e xtreme values of
eigenfunctions of classically chaotic quantum systems. Speciﬁcally, we examine the quantum
cat map, one of the best-studied models. First introduced by Berr y and Hannay in [ 3], cat
maps are the quantization of hyperbolic linear maps in SL(2 ,Z) on the 2-dimensional torus.
The quantum cat map is a toy model in quantum chaos. Another stan dard class of quantum
chaos models is given by Laplacian eigenfunctions on negatively curve d compact manifolds
(M,g), satisfying −∆gu=λ2uandnormalizedso that /bardblu/bardblL2= 1. Estimating thesuprema of
these Laplacian eigenfunctions has been an area of great interest . For example, Rudnick and
Sarnakin[ 17]showedthatonhyperbolic3-manifolds,thereexistsasequenceo feigenstates uk
such that /bardbluk/bardblL∞≫λ1/4. In regard to upper bounds, Levitan, Avakumovi´ c, and H¨ orma nder
in [13], [1], [8], respectively, proved the well-known result that on a compact Riem annian
manifold, /bardblu/bardblL∞/lessorsimilarλn−1
2wheren= dimM. However, it is conjectured that much stronger
results hold. Speciﬁcally, in [ 9], Iwaniec and Sarnak conjectured that for surfaces of constan t
negative curvature, /bardblu/bardblL∞/lessorsimilarελεfor allε >0; in the special case of Hecke eigenfunctions
on arithmetic surfaces they obtained the bound /bardblu/bardblL∞/lessorsimilarελ5
12+ε. The best known bound
outside of the arithmetic cases is the result of B´ erard [ 2]: when ( M,g) has no conjugate
points,/bardblu/bardblL∞=O(λn−1
2/√logλ).
In this paper, we are concerned with metaplectic transformations , the quantizations of hy-
perbolic maps

1Wedecompose L2(Rn) into adirect integral ofﬁnite-dimensional spaces HN(θ), whereθ∈T2
andN∈N. As shown in Section 2, the condition that ab,cdbe even is needed to make
sure that the metaplectic map associated to Adescends to a map from HN(0) to itself. We
denote the resulting quantum cat map by MN,0. An explicit basis for each HN(θ) is given
by Lemma 3. Foru∈ HN(θ), we use /bardblu/bardblℓpto denote the standard ℓpnorms applied to
coeﬃcients of this basis. We prove Theorem 1and Theorem 2, bounds on the ℓ∞norm
of eigenfunctions on HN(0). See Figure 1for a numerical illustration. Note that due to
the normalization in the spaces ℓ2andℓ∞, the standard bound on Laplacian eigenfunctions
/bardblu/bardblL2/lessorsimilar/bardblu/bardblL∞/lessorsimilarλn−1
2/bardblu/bardblL2becomes the bound1√
N/bardblu/bardblℓ2≤ /bardblu/bardblℓ∞≤ /bardblu/bardblℓ2.
In [4], Bonechi and De Bi` evre prove that for each A, there exists a sequence of MN,0with
“short” periods. Faure, Nonnenmacher, and Bi` evre use this re sult in [6] to show that there
exists asequence ofeigenfunctions thatarelocalized, asquantiﬁe d by semiclassical measures.
We also utilize [ 4] to show there exists a sequence of MN,0with localized eigenfunctions, as
demonstrated by the following lower bound.
Theorem 1. SupposeAis a matrix satisfying (1)with positive eigenvalues, even trace, and
coprime oﬀ-diagonal terms. Then we can ﬁnd a sequence of odd i ntegersNk→ ∞such that
for allε >0, there exists k0such that for all k≥k0, there exists an eigenfunction uofMN,0
with/bardblu/bardblℓ2= 1and
/bardblu/bardblℓ∞≥1−ε/radicalbig
2logλNk. (2)
Under more general assumptions, for all odd N, we have the following upper bound.
Theorem 2. SupposeAis a matrix satisfying (1). Then for 0< ε <1, there exists N0such
that for all odd N≥N0, ifuis an eigenfunction of MN,0with/bardblu/bardblℓ2= 1then
/bardblu/bardblℓ∞≤1/radicalbig
(1−ε)logλN. (3)
Analogous statements can be proven for a sequence of even Nand any θ, using similar
proofs to those of Theorems 1and2. However, we exclude these arguments as they are
overly technical and do not introduce any novel ideas.
Theℓ∞bounds on eigenfunctions of quantum cat maps have been extensiv ely studied in
arithmetic quantum chaos, see [ 10,12,14–16]. These works have focused on Hecke eigenfunc-
tions, which are joint eigenfunctions of the quantum cat map MN,0and the Hecke operators,
constructed in this setting by Kurlberg–Rudnick [ 11]. There always exists an orthonormal
basis ofHN(0) consisting of Hecke eigenfunctions; however, due to the poss ibility of large
multiplicities of the eigenspaces of MN,0(see [11, footnote 3]) an upper bound on the ℓ∞
norm of Hecke eigenfunctions does not imply the same bound for gen eral eigenfunctions. We
list below the known bounds on ℓ2-normalized Hecke eigenfunctions u:
•Kurlberg–Rudnick [ 12] proved the upper bound /bardblu/bardblℓ∞/lessorsimilarεN−1
8+ε.
•Building on [ 12] (which handled roughly half of the prime values of N), Kurlberg [ 10]
showed that for all but ﬁnitely many primevalues of None has the upper bound

bounds from Theorems 1and2, (2logλN)−1/2and (logλN)−1/2, respectively,
give the solid red lines. The dotted blue line is the trivial lower bound N−1/2.
Finally, the large red dots correspond to the sequence Nkfrom Theorem 1.

2.Preliminaries
We begin with a review of the necessary deﬁnitions for this paper. Fir st, recall the semiclas-
sical Weyl quantization. For a∈S(R2) and a semiclassical parameter h∈(0,1],
Oph(a)f(x):=1

Deﬁne the symbol class

,
which naturally induces the seminorms /bardbla/bardblCm:= max |α|≤msupR2|∂α
(x,ξ)a|form∈N0. From
[18, Theorem 4.16], we know for a∈S(1), Oph(a) acts on both S(R) and S′(R).
3Now, let ω= (y,η),z= (x,ξ)∈R2. Deﬁne the standard symplectic form σonR2by
σ(z,ω):=ξy−xηand deﬁne the quantum translation byUω:= Oph(aω), where aω(z):=
exp(i
hσ(ω,z)). Noting that aω(z)∈S(1), we see Uωis well-deﬁned and acts on S(R). In
[18, Theorem 4.7], it is shown that
Uωf(x) =ei
hηx−i
2hyηf(x−y).
Thus,Uωis a unitary operator on L2(R) that satisﬁes the following exact Egorov’s theorem,
(4) U−1
ωOph(a)Uω= Oph(˜a) for all a∈S(1),˜a(z):=a(z+ω).
From the fact that UωUω′=ei
2hσ(ω,ω′)Uω+ω′, we deduce the following commutator formula,
(5) UωUω′=ei
hσ(ω,ω′)Uω′Uω.
Now let Sp(2 ,R) be the group of real symplectic 2 ×2 matrices. In other words, A∈Sp(2,R)
if and only if σ(Az,Aω) =σ(z,ω). Note that in this speciﬁc 2-dimensional case, Sp(2 ,R) =
SL(2,R). For each A∈SL(2,R), denote by MAthe set of all unitary transformations
M:L2(R)→L2(R) satisfying the following exact Egorov’s theorem,
(6) M−1Oph(a)M= Oph(a◦A) for all a∈S(1).
From [18, Theorem 11.9], we have both existence of these transformations and uniqueness
up to a unit factor.
Then,M:=∪A∈SL(2,R)MAis a subgroup of unitary transformations of L2(R) called the
metaplectic group and the map M/ma√sto→Ais a group homomorphism M →SL(2,R). As
a corollary of equation ( 6), we obtain the following intertwining of the metaplectic and
quantum transformations: M−1UωM=UA−1ωfor allM∈ MA,ω∈R2.
We turn our attention to quantizations of functions on the torus T2:=R2/Z2. Eacha∈
C∞(T2) can be identiﬁed with a Z2-periodic function on R2. Note that any a∈C∞(T2) is
also an element of S(1), therefore its Weyl quantization Oph(a) is an operator on L2(R).
By equation ( 5), we have the following commutation relations,
(7) Oph(a)Uω=UωOph(a) for all a∈C∞(T2), ω∈Z2.
These commutation relations motivate a decomposition of L2(R) into a direct integral of
ﬁnite dimensional spaces HN(θ), whereθ∈T2, such that Oph(a) descends onto these spaces.
From [5, Proposition 2.1], to ensure the these spaces are nontrivial, for th e rest of the paper,
we assume
h= (2πN)−1whereN∈N.
We callHN(θ) the space of quantum states . Speciﬁcally, for each θ∈T2, set
HN(θ):=/braceleftbig
f∈S′(R) :Uωf=e2πiσ(θ,ω)+NπiQ(ω)ffor allω∈Z2/bracerightbig
,
where the quadratic form QonR2is deﬁned by Q(ω) =yηforω= (y,η)∈R2. The
following lemma gives an explicit basis for HN(θ).
4Lemma 3 ([7], Lemma 2.5) .The space HN(θ)isN-dimensional with a basis {eθ

We ﬁx an inner product /an}bracketle{t·,·/an}bracketri}htHon each quantum state HN(θ) by requiring {eθ
j}to be an
orthonormal basis. It can be shown using translation idenitities for eθ
j(see [7, (2.35)]) that
although each {eθ
j}depends on the choice of the representative θx∈R, the inner product
depends only on θ∈T2. We often denote the norm deﬁned by this inner product by /bardbl·/bardblℓ2.
Using the bases {eθ
j}, we can consider the spaces HN(θ) as ﬁbers of a smooth Ndimensional
vector bundle over T2, which we call HN.
Foru=/summationtextN−1

/bardblu/bardblℓp:=/bardbl(α0,...,α N−1)/bardblℓp.
FixN∈Nanda∈C∞(T2) to deﬁne the quantization
OpN,θ(a):= Oph(a)|HN(θ):HN(θ)→ HN(θ), θ∈T2,
which depends smoothly on θ. This restriction holds by deﬁnition of HN(θ) and the com-
mutation relations given in equation ( 7).
We set
(8) A=/bracketleftbigg
a b
c d/bracketrightbigg
∈SL(2,Z)
and choose a metaplectic operator M∈ MA. Recall that for ω= (y,η),z= (x,ξ)∈Z2,
σ(z,ω) =ξy−xηandQ(ω) =yη. By [7, Lemma 2.9], there exists a unique ϕA∈(Z/2)2
such that for all ω∈Z2,Q(A−1ω)−Q(ω) =σ(ϕA,ω) mod 2Z. Using the deﬁnition of
HN(θ) and that fact that M−1UωM=UA−1ω, we can verify that M(HN(θ))⊂ H(Aθ+NϕA
2)
for allθ∈T2.
DenoteMN,θ:=M|HN(θ):HN(θ)→ HN(Aθ+NϕA
2), which depends smoothly on θ∈T2.
We require the domain and range of MN,θto be the same, in other words, we must have
(9) ( I−A)θ=NϕA
2modZ2.
Thus, when θ= 0, condition ( 9) is satisﬁed when Nis even or ϕA= 0.
We henceforth assume that ϕA= 0, which gives σ(ϕA,ω) = 0 mod Z/2. Noting that for all
ω= (y,η),
Q(A−1ω)−Q(ω) = (dy−bη)(−cy+aη)−yη=−dcy2+2bcyη−baη2,
we must have dcy2+baη2= 0 mod 2 Z. We conclude that dcandabmust be even.
Assuming condition ( 9), we have the following exact Egorov’s theorem for all a∈C∞(T2),
M−1
N,θOpN,θ(a)MN,θ= OpN,θ(a◦A).
Essential to our proof of Theorem 2is the following explicit formula for M.

We provide a short outline of this formula’s derivation; for further d etails see Theorem 11.10
and its following remark in [ 18]. Set Λ = {(x,y,ξ,−η) : (x,ξ) =A(y,η)}and note that Λ is
a Lagrangiansubmanifold of R4. Additionally, as b/ne}ationslash= 0, Λ∋(x,y,ξ,η)/ma√sto→(x,η) is surjective.
Therefore, there exists a generating function Φ( x,y) such that Λ = {(x,y,∂xΦ,∂yΦ)}. As
η=−∂yΦ andξ=∂xΦ, we know Φ( x,y) is given by ( 11). We then have ( 10), where the
coeﬃcient ensures Mis unitary, up to a unit factor.
3.Proof of Theorem 1
First, following the presentation in [ 4], in Section 3.1, we show that for a sequence Nk,MNk,0
has a large degenerate eigenspace. In Section 3.2, we then reduce the proof of Theorem 1to
a linear algebra argument.
3.1.Eigenspace of MNk,0.Consider Agiven by ( 8) such that bandcare coprime and Tr A
is even and greater than 2. Let λbe the largest eigenvalue of A. Then for each t∈N,
(12) At=ptA−pt−1I, pt+1= Tr(A)pt−pt−1,wherept=λt−λ−t
λ−λ−1∈Z.
SetTN= min{t:At=ImodN}and, fork∈N, deﬁne
N′
k:= max{N:Ak=ImodN}.
Essential to our proof of Theorem 1is the following statement from [ 4]. For the reader’s
convenience, we replicate their proof here.
Theorem 5 ([4], Prop. 11) .For each k∈N, we have N′
2k= 2pk,N′
2k+1=pk+pk+1, and
TN′
k=k.
Proof.Using equation ( 12), we see that N′
kis the greatest integer such that
/bracketleftbigg
pka−pk−1−1 pkb
pkc p kd−pk−1−1/bracketrightbigg
=/bracketleftbigg
0 0
0 0/bracketrightbigg
modN′
k.
Recall that we assumed bandcare coprime. Therefore, pk= 0 mod N′
kandpk−1=−1
modN′
k, which gives N′
k= gcd(pk,pk−1+1). We claim that for s= 0,...,k−1,
(13) N′
k= gcd(pk−s+ps,pk−(s+1)+ps+1).
6We proceed by induction. Note that p0= 0 and p1= 1, therefore, ( 13) clearly holds
fors= 0. Now suppose we know ( 13) for some s≥0. Using ( 12) and the identity
gcd(a,ca−b) = gcd(a,b), we have
N′
k= gcd(Tr Apk−s−1−pk−s−2+ps, pk−s−1+ps+1)
= gcd(Tr A(pk−s−1+ps+1)−TrAps+1−pk−s−2+ps, pk−s−1+ps+1)
= gcd(ps+2+pk−(s+2), pk−(s+1)+ps+1),
which completes the induction. We set k= 2ℓ,s=ℓin (13) to conclude
N′
2ℓ= gcd(2pℓ,pℓ−1+pℓ+1) = gcd(2 pℓ,TrApℓ) = 2pℓ,
where the last equality follows from our assumption that Tr Ais even. Similarly, setting
k= 2ℓ+1 ands=ℓin (13) givesN′
2ℓ+1=pℓ+pℓ+1.
Now note that for each k, we have
(14) Ak= 1 mod N′
k,
(15) ATN′
k= 1 mod N′
k,andATN′
k= 1 mod N′
TN′
k.
From the deﬁnition of TN′
kand (14), we see that TN′
k≤k. From the deﬁnition of N′
kand
(15), we see that N′
k≤N′
TN′
k. As{N′
k}is increasing, we conclude that TN′
k≥k. Therefore,
TN′
k=k. /square
Now, let n(N) denote the period of MN,0; speciﬁcally
n(N):= min{t:Mt
N,0=eiϕfor some ϕ∈R}.
Suppose ANis the matrix with integer entries that satisﬁes ATN= 1+NAN. From [3, (36)-
(46)], we know that n(N) =TNifNis odd or if Nis even and ( AN)12and (AN)21are even.
Otherwise, n(N) = 2TN.
Using this formula for n(N) and Theorem 5, following [ 4], we show an upper bound for n(N)
that depends only on λandN.
Corollary 6. Letλbe the largest eigenvalue of A. Then, there exists a sequence of odd Nk
such that 2logλNk+1≥n(Nk).
Proof.Using our assumption that Tr Ais even, we note that p2kis even and p2k+1is odd.
Thus,n(N′
2k+1) =TN′
2k+1= 2k+1.
We now formulate a bound for n(N′
2k+1) in terms of N′
2k+1. As TrA >2, we know λ >1.
Additionally using Theorem 5,N′
2k+1=λk+1+λk−λ−k−1−λ−k
λ−λ−1≥λk. Therefore, logλN′
2k+1≥k,
which gives 2logλ(N′
2k+1)+1≥2k+1 =n(N′
2k+1). Labeling, N′
2k+1asNk, we are done. /square
Note that the same proof ideas can be adapted for a sequence of e venN, using the fact that
N′
2kis even. However, as the odd case is the simpler of the two, our main t heorem is proven
for a sequence of odd N.

. Speciﬁcally, each plot point
corresponds to the absolute value of the ith coordinate of the eigenfunction
for 0≤i≤N−1. Note that N= 2911 is an element of the sequence Nkin
Corollary 6, whileN= 991 is not.
For ease of notation, again using Nk:=N′
2k+1, set
tk:=n(Nk).
Therefore, if uis an eigenfunction of MNk,0with eigenvalue λ,Mtk
Nk,0u=eiϕku=λtku. Thus,
each eigenvalue of MNk,0satisﬁesλtk=eiϕk, giving an eigenvalue whose multiplicity is at
leastNk
tk. In other words, MNk,0has a degenerate eigenspace with dimension at leastNk
tk.
3.2.Lower Bound. Now we are ready to state the lower bound in linear algebraic terms.
Proposition 7. SupposeVis subspace of CNwith dimension at leastN

Therefore, there exists a jsuch that /bardblΠej/bardblℓ2≥1√

which completes the proof. /square
We claim that Proposition 7implies Theorem 1. In particular, ﬁxing Vto be the degenerate
eigenspace of MNk,0with dimension at leastNk

Proposition 7implies

2logλNk+1≤1√tk≤max

For an explicit demonstration of this lower bound, see Figure 2.
3.3.Eigenfunctions in Proposition 7.We further examine the eigenspace V, which
achieved the lower bound in Proposition 7. Recall we deﬁned Π to be the orthogonal projec-
tion onto Vand examined eigenfunctions of the form Π(/summationtextN−1
j=0αje0
j). To ﬁnd a more precise
formula for these eigenfunctions, we deduce a formula for Π.
Suppose Vcorresponds to eigenvalue λ. We know that the spectrum of MNk,0is contained in
{z:ztk=eiϕk}. Therefore, for some s∈Z,λis of the form eiϕk+2πs

We conjecture that the limit of eigenfunctions ( 18) equidistributes in the sense

We examine A∈SL(2,Z) of the form ( 1). Note that the conditions on Aare less restrictive
than those in Section 3. LetNbe odd. We begin with the following dispersive estimate.
