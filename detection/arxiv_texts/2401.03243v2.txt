particle, a droplet of radius 𝑟0∼𝑎0, where𝑎0is the Bohr radius. This droplet is of vanishing pressure and traps a monopole
within its bulk at a temperature of 𝑇𝑐=7.95keV. The monopole is the Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit. It is

charge at a value of the electromagnetic fine-structure constant 𝛼of𝛼−1∼134for soft external probes. It is shown that
the droplet does not exhibit an electric dipole or quadrupole moment due to averages of its far-field electric potential over
monopole positions. We also calculate the mixing angle 𝜃W∼30◦which belongs to deconfining phases of two SU(2) gauge
theories of very distinct Yang-Mills scales ( Λe=3.6keV andΛCMB∼10−4eV). Here, the condition that the droplet’s bulk
thermodynamics is stable determines the value of 𝜃𝑊. The core radius of the monopole, whose inverse equals the droplet’s
mass in natural units, is about 1% of 𝑟0.

1 INTRODUCTION
The electroweak interactions between leptons in the Standard
Model of Particle Physics (SM) are mediated by quantised gauge
fields, associated with the group U(1) 𝑌×SU(2) W. In the SM,
asymptotic lepton states are associated with point particles whose
localisation characteristics relate to quantum states of relativistic
matter waves, described by solutions to the Dirac equation, and
which depend on the presence or absence of external potentials.
Electroweak interactions are assumed to be governed by small
gaugecouplings: 𝑔′<1forU(1)𝑌and𝑔<1forSU(2) W.TheSM
is extremely successful and efficient in delivering a quantitative
description of scattering cross-sections, decay rates, branching
ratios, production and oscillation rates, as well as bound-state
properties. Renormalisability of the electroweak sector of the SM
(’t Hooft 1971b,a; ’t Hooft & Veltman 1972) assures that correc-
tions to an asymptotic state are calculable to any desired order in
the couplings 𝑔′and𝑔without having to introduce parameters in
addition to those of the defining Lagrangian. By resummation of
renormalisedFeynmandiagrams,theseparametersevolvewiththe

speaking, a parameter value obtained at a given four-momentum
transfer𝑃can be converted to that at a different four-momentum
transfer𝑃′by a rescaling that depends on logarithms of the ratio
𝑃/𝑃′.

given resolution. One can pick resolution to be vanishing, and we
argueinthepresentworkthat,underclearlystatedassumptions,in
this limit the values of the dimensionless electroweak parameters
𝛼and𝜃Wcan be approximated thermodynamically. Such an
approach is based on ideas by Louis de Broglie providing the
foundations for wave mechanics (de Broglie 1964, 1970). Namely,
the electron as a propagating matter wave emerges by applying
a Lorentz boost to a spatially extended and internally oscillating
system (a standing wave). De Broglie also noticed that the
transformations of wave frequency and the frequency of internal
oscillation are distinct in the same way as the transformations
of particle energy and internal heat are. This, however, reveals

the existence of a close link between relativistic thermodynam-
icsandthephysicalinsightsthatareattheheartofwavemechanics.
The present work takes up these profound ideas by de Broglie,
supplementedbyconcretenotionsofwhatthesourceofoscillation,
the oscillating medium, and the boundary of this medium are
in the framework of pure SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics
in four spacetime dimensions. As we shall argue, this enables
derivations of the values of the electroweak parameters 𝛼and
𝜃𝑊. To put this into perspective, we would also like to mention
other approaches. The experimental value of 𝛼in Eq.(1) is either
represented by numerology or linked to physics beyond that of
the SM. Pure numerology without a defined physical basis can
generate an impressive proximity to the value in Eq.(1), mostly
invoking combinations of primes, and prominent transcendental
numbers in elementary functions or continued fractions. These
resultsarereviewedin(Dattoli2010).Otherapproaches,including
Dirac’slargenumberhypothesisaswellasWeyl’shypothesis,both
invoking the classical radius of the electron, Casimir’s mousetrap
model, Kaluza-Klein theories, open-string scattering, invariants
under certain ad hoc symmetries and others are reviewed in
(Jentschura & Nándori 2014). Regarding the electroweak mixing

2013). For discussions on how the Weinberg angle relates to
consistency conditions in breaking the symmetry groups of grand
unified theories (GUT) in four or higher dimensions, see (Englert
et al. 2020) and references therein.
The strength of the SM is that parameters such as 𝛼and𝜃𝑊
can be evolved accurately to describe particle transitions that
are characterised by large four-momentum transfers. To such
processes, thermodynamics is not applicable. This is already
suggested by the fact that in the center-of-mass (COM) frame of
two colliding electrons the square of COM energy is given as
𝑠=4𝑚2𝑒(1−𝑣2)−1and that the temperature 𝑇0in each particle’s
restframe is, by invariance of local entropy under Lorentz boosts
(de Broglie 1970), decreased as 𝑇=√
1−𝑣2𝑇0. Here,±𝑣are
the respective particle speeds. Letting 𝑣↗1, we notice that,
as𝑠→ ∞, the temperature of each droplet vanishes, 𝑇↘0.
This associates a strongly boosted electron with the confining
phase of SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics by depriving it of
its 3D structure. Alternatively, an observer in the center-of-mass
frame instead of seeing colliding, spherical droplets sees 2D
’pancakes’ due to a strong Lorentz contraction along the boosted
coordinate. Therefore, the deconfining phase, whose restframe
thermodynamics mainly constitutes the droplet and defines its
Lorentz invariant properties mass 𝑚𝑒and electric charge 𝑞, is
invisible in the center-of-mass frame at large 𝑠, see Secs.4 and 5.
The process of pair creation of an electron and a positron, both
separated well at late times, by a pair of initially well separated
photonsisanotherexampleoflargefour-momentumtransferduring
the transition.
Here, a highly nonthermal, intermediate state of even locally in-
homogeneous energy density is generated. This intermediate state
emerges from local energy deposition into the ground state of the
confining phase of an SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. The round-point
center vortex loops composing this ground state are stretched and
twisted by such an energy composition (Hofmann 2016). Subse-
quently, this intermediate state equilibrates into a final state, the
electron.Intherestframeoftheensuingelectron,athermaldroplet
at rest is well separated spatially from the boosted thermal droplet
– the positron. In Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and to lowestorder in𝛼the nonthermal, intermediate of a pair creation pro-
cess, where both particles are not fully developed and close by, is
described by the electron propagator connecting the two vertices
of the associated Feynman diagram. This propagator mediates off-
shellpropagationofpositiveandnegativeenergystatesforwardand
backward through limited time intervals, and it is well known how
effective and precise the associated QED cross sections describe
theexperimentaldataonpaircreation(Feynman1949).Therefore,
QED (and more generally the SM) is a powerful tool to quanti-
tatively assess collisional transitions of asymptotic particle states
whose intrinsic thermodynamics is of no use to describe such pro-
cesses. Yet, as we will argue in the present work, defining particle
properties can be obtained from a thermodynamical approach op-
erating in their restframes.
A situation that QED and the SM is unlikely to describe well,
however, is the physics of a dense and thermal2state of electrons
and positrons in terms of particle and energy transport, charge
and spin fluctuations as well as correlation functions of particle
number densities and particle speeds. An important signature to
search for in this regard is the creation of electron-positron pairs
by macroscopic droplet evaporation, in terms of their gamma-ray
annihilation lines originating outside the droplet. The formation
of such extended droplets is facilitated by localised deposition of
ultra-high energy density through compact, ultra-high contrast,
femtosecond lasers focused to relativistic intensities onto targets
composed of aligned nanowire arrays (Bargsten et al. 2017). This

a spot size of∼5𝜇m which would guarantee the creation of
macroscopic droplet dimensions.
In this paper, we consider the simultaneous presence of all phases
(deconfining/preconfining/confining) of 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills
thermodynamics within a ball-like spatial region of radius 𝑟0,
a droplet. In particular, we demonstrate how the mixing within
the deconfining phase of two SU(2) Yang-Mills theories of vastly
disparate scales, SU(2) CMBand SU(2) e, appears to yield a re-
alistic value for the electroweak mixing angle due to vanishing

SU(2) emonopole4. The thick boundary shell thus is a region of
high electric conductivity due to condensed monopoles in the
preconfining phase of SU(2) e. It is an essential assumption of the
present paper that in the limit of a static equlibirium the thick
boundary shell is sharply delineated from the bulk at ¯𝑟 < 𝑟 0.
That is, for each volume element within the thick boundary shell
contracting forces, stemming from the mixing of deconfining and
preconfining phases of SU(2) e, are cancelled by the expanding
force due to the plasma of the deconfining phase of SU(2) CMB5.
In any case, the pressure vanishes on the confining-phase side of
the Hagedorn transition in SU(2) e, that is, outside the droplet for
𝑟 >𝑟 0(Hofmann 2016).
We also assume (i) effective hydrostatic equilibrium of the thick

On the other hand, the spatial extent of the electron refers to a
dynamicalequilibriumwhichisveryclosetothestaticequilibrium
assumedin(i).Thiscanbepicturedasfollows:Thethickboundary
shell could effectively produce negative pressure by an imbalance
of the partial pressures stemming from phase mixing in SU(2) e
(negative) and gauge theory mixing with SU(2) CMB(positive).
The bulk surface would then have to impose a positive counter
pressure(homogeneousinthebulkduetothequantumcorrelation
length|𝜙|−1being much larger than the droplet’s extent),
that is𝑇 > 𝑇 0. Alternatively, the thick boundary shell could
exhibit an imbalance of partial pressures to effectively produce
positive pressure to which the bulk surface would react by pull
(negative pressure). This describes the droplet’s breathing around
a stable equilibrium where bulk and boundary-shell pressures
independently vanish. In the absence of external forces, breathing
amplitudes for the deviations of droplet radii and pressures
away from this equilibrium are small6. Therefore, assuming an
overall vanishing of pressures is justified for an initial estimate
of monopole charge distribution, bulk gauge-theory mixing, and
droplet mass. Regarding assumption (ii), we argue in Sec.4.3.1
that shortly after pair creation in each droplet Yang-Mills phases
are not segregated and that therefore, the only radial scale ¯𝑟to

This paper is organised as follows. For the benefit of readabil-
ity and better access to our derivations we review in Sec.2 the
thermal phase structure of a (3+1)-dimensional Minkowskian and
effectively quantum SU(2)Yang-Mills theory as it emergesfrom a
4-dimensional, fundamental, and classical SU(2) Yang-Mills the-
ory defined on the Euclidean cylinder R3×𝑆1. In particular, we
discuss the nature of the transitions from deconfining via precon-
fining to the confining phase and how the respective (thermal)
ground states emerge by dense packings of fundamental topologi-
caldefectswhosecentralregionsarenotresolvedintherespective
effective theories. Sec.3 is devoted to a brief review of previous
work on finite-volume SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics inside
the droplet that represents the spatial region of selfintersection of
a center-vortex loop, immersed into the confining phase. Such a
droplet traps a perturbed Bogmolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS)
monopole causing monopole and plasma vibrations. A stepwise
approach towards a droplet model capable of approximating the
experimental value of the electromagnetic fine-structure constant
𝛼isdevelopedinSec.4.Thismodel,whichisshortofmixingtwo

phases of SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics. It also uses a spher-

Moreover, the model introduces the mean of the radial position of
the monopole over the entire droplet volume to segregate a thick
boundary shell from deconfining-phase bulk thermodynamics. Fi-
nally, the droplet charge is expressed as a bulk-volume average. In

state of the preconfining phase is constituted from massless mag-
netic monopoles and antimonopoles. In physics models, these are
dually interpreted and therefore represent electric monopoles and
antimonopoles (Hofmann & Kaviani 2012).
Dense packing of monopole and antimonopole cores is described
by an effective, inert, complex scalar field 𝜑which breaks the
remaining gauge symmetry U(1) dynamically. The overlap of all
peripheries at the position of a given monopole or antimonopolecore is described by an effective pure-gauge configuration 𝑎𝐷,gs
𝜇.
In the preconfining phase, the Polyakov loop, evaluated on the
effective ground-state gauge field 𝑎𝐷,gs
𝜇, is unity in both winding
andunitarygauge.Thisisindicativeofthefactthatthepreconfining
phase already confines infinitely heavy, fundamental test charges,
although massive, propagating gauge modes can still be excited.
The pressure throughout the deconfining phase is negative. If it
were not for phase mixing, the ground state of the preconfining
phase would be a superconductor. But even in the presence of
phase mixing, electric conductance is expected to be very high for
𝜆𝑐′≤𝜆≤𝜆𝑐compared to the deconfining and confining phases.

These massless solitons, so-called thin center-vortex loops, break
the magnetic center symmetry Z2dynamically ’t Hooft (1978)

round, massless points Moosmann & Hofmann (2012). The ensu-
ing new Z2degenerate ground state, which confines fundamental
test charges and does not support thermal gauge-mode excitation
anymore, can be shown to possess no energy density and to exert
no pressure (Hofmann 2016).
The liberation of thin center-vortex loops at 𝜆𝑐′from the ground
state of the preconfining phase initiates the Hagedorn transition.
Effectively, this process is described in terms of phase changes by
±𝜋of a complex scalar field Φ.Such phase changes accompany

loopsleadtotwistingsandtheformationsofstableregionsofself-
intersections which, in their restframes, are characterised by the
droplets of radius 𝑟0that we have alluded to in Sec. 1, see also
Sec.3. The density of states Ω(𝐸)of solitons, which are subject
to an arbitrary number of selfintersections, rises more than expo-
nentially in energy 𝐸. Therefore, no partition function exists for
𝜆∼𝜆𝑐′(confining phase), and thermodynamics is not a valid de-
scription anymore. (This can already be inferred from the fact that
for𝜆↘𝜆𝑐′the entropy density vanishes which violates Nernst’s
theorem.)
2.4 Summary of phase structure of SU(2) Yang-Mills
thermodynamics
To summarise, SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics comes in three
phases, see Fig.1. The deconfining phase (phase I) breaks SU(2)
to U(1) in terms of a thermal ground state estimate which is com-
posedoftrivial-holonomyanticaloronsandcaloronsoftopological
charge𝑘=∓1. For𝜆≫𝜆𝑐rare dissociations of (anti)calorons,
induced by large holonomy shifts, create isolated monopoles and
antimonopoles which, however, are spatially not resolved in the
effectivetheory.For 𝜆∼2...3𝜆𝑐thedistancebetweenmonopoles
and antimonopoles is comparable to the spatial resolution set by
|𝜙|−1, and therefore they become explicit and isolated degrees of
freedom. In the effective theory, the collective imprint of these
monopoles and antimonopoles onto thermodynamical quantities

(Hofmann 2016)) or dispersion laws for propagating gauge modes

A thin center vortex can be understood as a chain of unresolved

a lowering of external resolution (Grayson 1989), we propose the

4 VALUE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FINE-STRUCTURE
CONSTANT: EFFECTIVE DROPLET CHARGE IN
PURE SU(2) E
4.1 Trapping a single monopole or antimonopole inside the
droplet’s bulk
Let us first discuss the simplified situation in which the physics of
a droplet is governed by a single gauge theory: SU(2) e. We aim
to derive the dual charge8of such a system. A monopole or an
antimonopole is immersed into the droplet’s bulk of deconfining
phase at temperature 𝑇0. From now on we consider the situation
of a trapped monopole only, since that of a trapped antimonopole
simply is described by sign inversions of all charges considered.
As discussed previously, 𝑇0=1.32𝑇𝑐,eis the temperature where
the pressure of the droplet vanishes Hofmann & Grandou (2022).
Due to the high conductance of the boundary shell ( ¯𝑟≤𝑟≤𝑟0)
and for ¯𝑟∼𝑟0a spherical mirror-charge construction (Zahn 2023)
can be used to approximate the droplet charge for probes of long
wavelengths. This construction is depicted in Fig.4. Here 𝑠or𝑠′
denote the respective distances between observer and monopole
or observer and mirror charge. Monopole and mirror charge are
both positioned on a radial ray pointing away from the droplet
center. As seen from the droplet center, angle 𝜃subtends the
directionoftheobserverandthedirectionofthisray.Thedistance
between observer and droplet center is denoted by 𝑜. In thin-shell
approximation, we set ¯𝑟=𝑟0.
Since a mirror charge construction for boundary conditions on a
sphericalsurfaceoperateswithCoulombpotentialsfortheinducing
and the mirror charge (Zahn 2023), it is essential to secure that a
Yukawa factor exp(−𝑠/𝑙𝑠)for the potential associated with the
monopole’s charge inside the ball can be treated as unity. Here 𝑙𝑠
denotesthechargescreeninglengththatarisesfromotherscreened
and stable dipoles in the infinite-volume plasma (Hofmann 2016).
Letusthuschecktheselfconsistencyofonlyoneexplicitmonopole
orantimonopoleinhabitatingthedropletofradius 𝑟0.Thisrequires
an estimate of 𝑙𝑠/𝑟0≫1. In (Hofmann & Grandou 2022) it was
found for a pure SU(2) etheory describing the droplet that
𝑟0=4.043
𝜋𝑇0=0.44Λ−1
e. (10)
In Sec.5.4 we derive a deviating estimate of 𝑟0which includes
the mixing of SU(2) CMBand SU(2) e. The screening length 𝑙𝑠=
71.43/𝑇wasextractedfromatwo-loopradiativecorrectiontothe
pressureatlargetemperatures, 𝑇≫𝑇0,see(Ludescher&Hofmann
2009). For an estimate, we may continue this asymptotic result to
𝑇0to obtain
𝑙𝑠
𝑟0∼55.5≫1. (11)
Therefore, for 0≤𝑠≤2𝑟0a Yukawa factor exp(−𝑠/𝑙𝑠)to
the Coulomb potential, which could arise from other explicit
monopoles and antimonopoles within the droplet, can be set equal
to unity. Thus, the assumption of a single monopole being trapped
in the bulk of the droplet indeed is selfconsistent.
4.2 Thin-shell approximation
In deriving the effective charge of the droplet at bulk temperature
𝑇=𝑇0and in the long-wavelength limit, we first analyse the lim-
its of vanishing shell thickness 𝑟0=¯𝑟and superconductivity of
the boundary shell, see Fig.3. Moreover, we neglect the effects of
monopolebreathing(Fodor&Rácz2004;Forgács&Volkov2004)

4.3 Averaging the droplet’s effective charge over monopole
locations
4.3.1 Droplet creation and thermalisation
When a droplet of radius 𝑟0, containing a trapped monopole,
forms in an SU(2) egauge theory it is a priori not thermalised,
and the monopole’s location within the droplet, which is a mixed
state of all three phases, is equally likely everywhere in the ball
apart from a thin boundary shell. A uniform a priori distribution
of monopole location in Cartesian coordinates is then cast into
a nonflat probability density 𝜌(𝑟,𝜃)in spherical coordinates for
0≤𝑟 < 𝑟 0and for a polar angle 0≤𝜃 < 𝜋, see Sec.4.3.2.
The thin boundary shell of the droplet (the radial location 𝑟∼𝑟0
where the Hagedorn transition to the confining phase takes place)
is characterised by decoupled dual Abelian gauge modes and8Meinert and Hofmann
off-Cartan modes which, due to their large masses, cannot be
redistributed into the interior of the droplet. Only after bulk
thermalisation is attained for a central radial region does an
extended boundary region materialise – a thick boundary shell
(¯𝑟=𝜉𝑟0< 𝑟 < 𝑟 0with 0< 𝜉 < 1) exhibiting a temperature
gradient and defining the transition from the deconfining via the
preconfining to the confining phase via phase mixing. As the
trappedmonopoleentersthisregion,itrapidlychangesitsidentity9.
Let us discuss this situation and its consequences in more detail.
If, after bulk thermalisation, the monopole is kicked towards the
thick boundary shell then it undergoes mass and charge reduction
untilitbecomesapartofthe(spatiallyinhomogeneous)monopole-
antimonopole condensate contributing to the phase mixture there
(Hofmann 2016). Yet, to explicitly conserve charge (or 3D wind-
ing number) and droplet mass, another monopole, formerly part
of the condensate, needs to act in place of the original monopole
in the bulk of the droplet (deconfining phase). Ignoring correla-
tions between monopoles and antimonopoles inside and close to
the condensate within the boundary shell, one may approximate
a given monopole’s probability density of location by the a priori
distribution 𝜌(𝑟,𝜃). However, the monopole’s charge 𝑞e(and its
mass) is a function of 𝑟which is flat and finite in the droplet’s
bulk (deconfining phase) but rapidly approaches zero as the radial
location approaches ¯𝑟=𝜉𝑟0. Since no length scale other than 𝑟0
characterises the a priori distribution 𝜌(𝑟,𝜃)in the limit of van-
ishing probe four-momentum transfer, we are led to associate 𝜉
withthemeanradialpositionofthemonopole(fluctuationsofthis
mean can be neglected at vanishing four-momentum transfer, see
Sec.4.3.2) according to 𝜌,
⟨𝑟⟩𝜌
𝑟0≡𝜉=3
4. (14)
Physically, the droplet’s bulk is subject to a mixing of two thermal
gaugetheories,SU(2) eandSU(2) CMB,seeSec.5.2.This,however,
does not invalidate the above argument, since the (nonthermal)
probefieldalwaysresidesinSU(2) e(Hofmann2016)andtherefore

Although this value is higher than the one of Eq.(19), it is
still quite far off the experimental value associated with Eq.(1).
One may think that this discrepancy arises because thin-shell
perfect-conductor boundary conditions were used to model a
thick boundary shell of finite conductance. Certainly, there is a
(not easy to compute) correction to Eq.(21) to compensate for
this simplification. However, a far more important conceptual
ingredient is missing in Eq.(19): Mixing effects due to the two
gauge theories SU(2) eand SU(2) CMBproviding a stable mix of
deconfining-phase plasmas in the bulk of the droplet to yield an
environment that allows the existence of an isolated monopole
for each theory. It is the SU(2) ecomponent of this mixture
whose monopole together with its mirror charge determine the
charge distribution of an electron as seen by a directed, external

(Weinberg1967;Glashow1959;Salam&Ward1964),theuniver-
sality of the two reduced couplings in Eqs.(26) and (24) (mixed

That is, in the SU(2) CMB×SU(2) emodel𝜃Wmay change as a

Also, the effective dual, massive U(1) mode of the preconfining

slightly below 𝑇𝑐,e, the masses 𝑚𝑊±and𝑚𝑍0cannot be defined10Meinert and Hofmann
thermodynamically in the SU(2) CMB×SU(2) emodel. Because of
this and since, thermodynamically, all massive gauge bosons are
solely generated in SU(2) ea definition of 𝜃Wvia Eq.(30) would
be meaningless, and we have to resort to Eq.(27) for a useful
thermodynamical definition of 𝜃W. In the absence of CP-violating
terms in the fundamental Yang-Mills action, like in the SM, there
is no theoretical basis in the SU(2) CMB×SU(2) emodel for why
only left-handed charged currents couple to the weak, massive
gauge fields. Also, lepton universality, which comprises instable
mu- and tau-leptons and their neutrinos, is a concept difficult to
describe thermodynamically by an extension of our present model
toSU(2) CMB×SU(2) e×SU(2)𝜇×SU(2)𝜏.However,certainconsid-

The Standard Model is highly efficient and successful in address-
ingallthesefeatures.Forthetimebeing,wethereforemustconfine
our discussion of electroweak physics to the electromagnetic cou-
pling of electrons to thermal photons or propagating electromag-
netic waves. Still, such limited understanding of the underpinning
of electroweak physics in the SU(2) CMB×SU(2) emodel produces

5.2 Mixing angle 𝜃W
During the creation of an electron-positron pair, we must assume
that the fundamental gauge fields that initiate the formation of the
two droplets are purely 𝐴𝜇,esince the initial two-photon state is
nonthermal ( 𝜃W=0) (Hofmann 2016). Once the droplet volumes
definethemselvesandafterinternalthermalequilibriumisattained,
there is a fixed mixing angle 𝜃W. An intriguing feature of the
Standard Model is that the value of 𝜃Wcan be computed at a
certainfour-momentumtransferfromthevalueof 𝜃Wmeasuredat
another four-momentum transfer. The intriguing feature of SU(2)
Yang-Mills thermodynamics is that the value of 𝜃Wat zero four-
momentum transfer appears to be computable independently of
whatisassumedsofarinderivingthevalueof 𝛼.Letusdemonstrate
this.

Notethetendencyofamildincreaseof 𝜃WfromEq.(44)toEq.(43)

The thermodynamically determined value of 𝜃Win Eq.(42) is our

rately from bulk thermodynamics without having to make explicit
assumptions on the finite-volume physics of the droplet’s thick
boundaryshell,whereSU(2) eandSU(2) CMBandallphasesofthe

sure of this shell as exerted onto the bulk is zero. Note that for an
infinite-volume system, where stability constraints are irrelevant,
we have𝜃W(𝜆)=45◦for the mixing of the theories SU(2) eand
SU(2) CMBin the conformal limit 𝜆≫𝜆0.
5.3 Value of 𝛼
Considering gauge-theory mixing inside the deconfining-phase

which probes the droplet charge, to reside in SU(2) e, we may use
Eq.(23) to obtain

4𝜋. (45)
Appealing to the value of 𝜃Win Eq.(42) and to the value of 𝑒(𝜆0)
in Eq.(41) yields
𝛼−1=134.3. (46)
This deviates by only 2% from the experimental value of Eq. (1).
However, in contrast to the determination of the Weinberg angle
𝜃W, which is a quantity that depends only on the stability of bulk
thermodynamics in a finite volume ( 𝑃bulk=0) and on the univer-
sality of monopole charges, the determination of the fine-structure
constant𝛼hinges in addition on phase mixing withinSU(2) eand
mixingofthegaugegroupsSU(2) eandSU(2) CMBinsidethethick
boundary shell. For this boundary shell, defined by a vanishing
monopole charge in SU(2) ewithin the radial extent ¯𝑟≤𝑟≤𝑟0
(¯𝑟=𝜉𝑟0themeanradiusw.r.t.theaprioridistributionofmonopole
location), we also had to assume vanishing pressure. To under-
stand the physics of the thick boundary shell better is the subject
of future work. An according improvement of the mirror-charge
construction used so far to define the droplet’s charge but also the
effectofdroplet revolutionontheprobability density 𝜌inEq.(15)could decrease the difference between the value of 𝛼in Eq.(46)
and its experimental value in Eq.(1).

Still,thisissufficientlylargerthanunitytojustifythemirror-charge

That is, due to mixing, the core-size of the trapped monopole,
which according to the first part of Eq.(47) is close to 𝑟𝑐Fodor
& Rácz (2004), becomes even more pointlike compared to the
droplet’s extent than for the case of a pure SU(2) emodel where
𝑟𝑐/𝑟0=1/52.40. Eq.(55) also implies that

Such a large ratio of order unity is in line with Louis de Broglie’s
proposal de Broglie (1964) that the free electron at rest repre-
sents the oscillation of a thermal plasma of finite extent and spa-
tially constant amplitude driven by a vibrating monopole. Namely,
withinthedeconfiningbulkofthedropletatrest,thesuperposition
of spherical wavelets of constant frequency and wavelength but
highly random phase and variable origin plausibly yield a plasma
oscillation of nearly constant spatial amplitude — the basic in-
sightofdeBroglie’sdeductionoftheelectron’smatterwavelength
paving the way for wave mechanics Schrödinger (1926). Note that
also outside the droplet, the spatially decaying Coulomb field 𝑎3

due to SU(2) CMBat temperatures that locally are higher than the
CMB baseline temperature within a certain, local environment of
the droplet.
6 DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
In this work we have proposed the electron to be a figure-eight
shaped soliton formed by a thin center-vortex loop in SU(2) Yang-
Mills theory where the region of selfintersection is an extended
droplet. This soliton is stable and immersed into the confining
groundstateofanSU(2)Yang-Millstheoryofscale3.60keV.More-
over, the soliton is subject to the confining ground states of other
Yang-MillstheorieswithhigherscalesandtheCosmicMicrowave
Background (CMB). In the present work, we associate the CMB
withthedeconfiningphaseofanSU(2)Yang-Millstheoryofscale
∼10−4eV (SU(2) CMB) (Hofmann 2016, 2009).
Based on the definition of the Bohr magneton, we also link
the electron’s magnetic moment to revolutions of the droplet’s
effective charge. These revolutions are induced by the unresolved
monopoles and antimonopoles moving along and constituting the
center-vortex loop. The contribution of the thin vortex lines to
the total mass of this soliton is negligible, see (Hofmann 2016).
However, vortex lines may play a role in producing nonlocal
interactions that magnetically correlate electrons in a 2D plane
(Moosmann & Hofmann 2012).

callysuperimposesacaloronandananticaloroncenterandoverlap-
ping(anti)caloronperipheries.Undertheselfconsistentassumption
that the droplet’s bulk can be represented by infinite-volume ther-
modynamics, we have derived the following statements:
(i) Bulk stability, that is, the vanishing of the thermodynamical
pressure deep inside the droplet implies a mixing angle between
theYang-MillstheoriesSU(2) eandSU(2) CMBatoneandthesame
temperature 𝑇0which practically coincides with the value of the
weakmixing(orWeinberg)angleoftheStandardModelofParticle
Physics.
(ii) The value of the electromagnetic fine-structure constant 𝛼at
vanishing energy-momentum transfer is reasonably well approxi-
matedbyamirrorchargeconstruction,suggestedbythehighelec-
tric conductivity of the droplet’s thick boundary shell. In addition,
the derivation of the value of 𝛼relies on (a) a thermodynami-
cal SU(2) eand SU(2) CMBgauge-theory mixing plus monopole
charge universality, (b) stability of the thick boundary shell by its
assumed, vanishing mean pressure, and (c) the statistical average
of the droplet’s charge over the bulk volume w.r.t. a spatially ho-
mogeneous distribution, cut off at the mean radius (condition that
thethickboundaryshellisexcludedasaregionforpositioningthe
isolated monopole of the SU(2) ecomponent of the bulk plasma).
(iii) The droplet’s mass formula, in generalisation of (Hofmann
& Grandou 2022) now considering SU(2) eand SU(2) CMBgauge-
theorymixing,predictsadropletsize 𝑟0whichiscomparablewith
the Bohr radius 𝑎0. For the core size of the monopole 𝑟𝑐(the
reduced Compton wave length (Fodor & Rácz 2004; Forgács &
Volkov 2004; de Broglie 1964)) we therefore obtain 𝑟𝑐∼𝛼𝑟0∼

a consequence, the monopole core indeed is an (unresolved) point

of a (anti)caloron which constitutes the thermal ground state.
(iv) The Yang-Mills scale Λeof SU(2) eand the critical temper-
ature𝑇𝑐,eare derived from this mass formula, applying it to the
mass of the electron 𝑚e=511keV. One has: Λe=3.60keV or𝛼,𝜃𝑊from YM Thermodynamics 13
𝑇𝑐,e=7.95keV. This implies a critical temperature 𝑇𝑐′,eof the
Hagedorntransitionas 𝑇𝑐′,e=11.57

spatio-temporal design of fusion plasmas is optimised to accom-
plishsteady-stateoperation,involvingcomparableelectrontemper-
atures (and high electron densities), these results should be taken
intoaccountindevisingmagneticandinertialplasmaconfinement
strategies.
(v) There is an environment to the stationary droplet of an
extent yet to be specified which is characterised by a plasma of
deconfining SU(2) CMBphase, slightly hotter than the CMB. This
deconfining plasma vibrates at a frequency ∼𝑚e. The monopole
of SU(2) CMBmay alternate its location from the droplet’s bulk
region into this environment and vice versa.
Let us now briefly discuss possible links of these results to
phenomena discussed in the literature. In our present approach,
we would interpret the particle at rest as the droplet whose
vibrating (standing) external Coulomb potential is transformed
into a propagating wave upon boost (de Broglie 1970), giving rise
to observable (self-)interference effects to statistically determine
the droplet’s position (Merli et al. 1976). As mentioned in
the introduction, we do expect a considerable impact of the
thermodynamical approach to the electron proposed here in
better understanding collective plasma phenomena at electron
temperatures starting at around 𝑇∼𝑇𝑐=6.6keV in experiments
with magnetic plasma confinement which were not predicted
by conventional magneto-hydrodynamics. These could include
the formation of an edge transport barrier associated with a
pressure pedestal, edge-localised modes, magnetic instabilities,
and ion-orbit losses in the high-confinement mode (Laggner et al.
2019; Stacey 2013). Note that the electron plasma density 𝑛𝑒in
conventional tokamaks and stellerators is 𝑛𝑒∼1020m−3while a
macroscopically stabilised plasma droplet at 𝑇=𝑇0=9.38keV
with an energy density of 𝜌(𝑇0)=1.77×104keV4represents a
number density of percolated electrons of 𝑛𝑒∼1.79×1028m−3.
Therefore, eight orders of magnitude in electron density are
missing in order to achieve a macroscopically stabilised plasma
state. Still, the above-mentioned effects at much lower electron
densities may point to the here-proposed model of the electron.
An important question, which arises due to a modelling of the
electroweak parameters 𝜃Wand𝛼that apparently is particular to
the electron as a thermal and stable quantum particle, concerns

spectively, disperse the energies invested in surplus to their
quantum mass, defined by a generalisation of Eq.(50), into
their surroundings and can only trap an SU(2) 𝜇or an SU(2) 𝜏
monopole, respectively, see Fig.6b) for the muon droplet. The
other monopoles are free to leave or re-enter this droplet. In case
of SU(2) CMBthis ab initio dispersion of energy does not define
new phase boundaries since the CMB represents the deconfining
phase (likely very close to the deconfining-preconfining transition
Hofmann (2016)). In case of SU(2) 𝜇or SU(2) enew droplets
are formed that embed the initial droplet, see Fig.6c) for the
case of SU(2) e. This process of (cascading) droplet formation
invokes formerly single, round-point center-vortex loops from
confining-phase ground states to define the respective droplets
as their stabilised regions of selfintersection: single center-vortex
loops thus turn into figure-eight shaped center-vortex loops. In the
Standard Model of Particle Physics, this subprocess refers to the
absorptionofanantineutrino,compareFig.6b)andFig.6f).Afterquantum equilibration, the initial droplets’ bulks exhibit defined
mixing angles for four or three deconfining SU(2) Yang-Mills
theoriesbytwoorthreecharge-universalityconditions(ingeneral:
in the droplet representing the 𝑁th lepton family there are 𝑁
charge-universality conditions fixing the 𝑁independent compo-
nentsofaunitvectorinan (𝑁+1)-dimensionalEuclideanspaceor
𝑁mixing angles), respectively, and a defined temperature by the
condition of vanishing bulk pressure. Since the according leptons
are unstable, no (temporally) coherently propagating waves in the
Cartan algeba’s of SU(2) 𝜏and SU(2)𝜇exist that could externally
probe these charges and the magnetic moments that relate to the
center-vortex loops extending from 𝜇- and𝜏-droplets. Therefore,
even though the electron droplet contains 𝜇- and𝜏-droplets and
their respective, trapped monopoles, only the trapped monopole
and the magnetic moment provided by the center-vortex loop in
SU(2) eare seen externally. For the charge of 𝜇and𝜏leptons,
we thus are back at the derivation of the charge of an electron
(or fine-structure constant 𝛼), see Sec.5.3. Their decays can be
figured as processes, where embedded droplets of much smaller

trappedmonopoles,locallyintothoseofthenonthermallydistorted
respective boundary shells. This local investment of energy into
the boundary shell can be thought of as a transient excitation of a
𝑊±-boson in the Standard Model of Particle Physics. As a result,
an energetic neutrino is emitted: a figure-eight shaped center-
vortex loop looses its droplet together with the trapped monopole
when interacting with the thick boundary shell to transform
into a single center-vortex, see Fig.6d) for 𝜇-decay and Fig.6f)

To relate hadrons to pure Yang-Mills thermodynamics is much
harder than for leptons. Hadrons are complex quantum systems of
confined (anti)quarks that are effectively and efficiently described
by Quantum Chromodynamics Gross & Wilczek (1973); Politzer
(1973). To address the emergence of (anti)quarks as electrically
fractionally charged particles within pure Yang-Mills theories of
one and the same electric-magnetic parity is impossible. Rather, a
derivation of quark properties probably would require an interplay
and mixing of electric-magnetic dual SU(3) Yang-Mills models to
allow a version of the fractional Quantum Hall effect Tsui et al.
(1982); Laughlin (1981, 1983) to take place.
In closing, we would like to state clearly that there cannot be any
doubt that the Standard Model of Particle Physics represents a
milestone development in accurately and efficiently describing the
interactions of leptons and hadrons. Essentially, this theory rests
on well organised weak-coupling expansions that implement the
gauge principle in a perturbatively consistent way Taylor (1971);
Slavnov(1972)andthatareapplicabletoanysofarprobedenergy-
momentum transfer. A thermodynamical approach to the interac-
tionsof leptons and hadrons in terms of pure Yang-Mills theory
is inferior to the Standard Model. What the Standard Model is
incapable of delivering though is a ground-state structure doing
justicetocosmologicalobservationsRiessetal.(1998);Perlmutter
et al. (1999), to provide a useful framework for thermal and non-
thermal phase transitions Choi et al. (2021), a postdiction of the
absolute values of (some of) its dimensionless parameters, and a
deepergraspofthenatureofparticle-matter-wavedualityconcern-
ingchargedleptons.Asthepresentworkintendedtodemonstrate,a14Meinert and Hofmann
computationoftwooftheStandardModel’sdimensionlessparam-
eter values appears to be feasible. The here-proposed venue is still
far from addressing other in-built features of the Standard Model
such as parity violation of the weak interactions, a derivation of
theelectron’smagneticmomentincludingtheanomalousquantum
behaviour, a quantitative grasp of the entries of the CKM matrix,
or the fractional electric charges of quarks. We hope to gain more
insight into these problems in the future.
