Efﬁcient Design for Multi-user Downlink
Beamforming with Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surface
Mohammad Ebrahimi and Min Dong, Fellow, IEEE
Abstract —This paper considers downlink multi-user transmis-
sion facilitated by a reconﬁgurable intelligent surface (R IS). First,
focusing on the multi-group multicast beamforming scenari o, we
develop a fast and scalable algorithm for the joint base stat ion
(BS) and RIS beamforming optimization to minimize the trans mit
power subject to the user quality-of-service (QoS) constra ints. By
exploring the structure of this QoS problem, we show that the joint
beamforming optimization can be naturally decomposed into a BS
multicast beamforming QoS problem and an RIS passive multic ast
beamforming max-min-fair (MMF) problem. We propose an
alternating multicast beamforming (AMBF) algorithm to sol ve the
two subproblems alternatingly. For the BS QoS subproblem, w e
utilize the optimal multicast beamforming structure to obt ain the
BS beamformers efﬁciently. Furthermore, we reformulate th e chal-
lenging RIS MMF subproblem and employ a ﬁrst-order projecte d
subgradient algorithm (PSA), which yields closed-form upd ates.
The computational complexity of the AMBF algorithm grows
linearly with the number of RIS elements and BS antennas. We
further show that the AMBF approach is also an efﬁcient metho d
for the RIS-assisted downlink multi-user unicast beamform ing
problem, providing semi-closed-form updates. Next, we stu dy the
MMF problem for the RIS-assisted downlink beamforming desi gn
and propose a PSA-based fast algorithm to compute the BS
and RIS beamforming solutions with closed-form updates per
iteration, leading to a highly computationally efﬁcient so lution.
Simulation results show the efﬁcacy of our proposed algorit hms
in both performance and computational cost compared to othe r
alternative methods.
I. I NTRODUCTION
Reconﬁgurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging tec h-
nology that can actively control and improve the wireless
propagation channel conditions and thus creates a smart re-
conﬁgurable wireless environment to enhance communicatio ns
performance [2], [3]. RIS uses a planar surface consisting o f
passive reﬂective elements to control the phase shifts of th e
reﬂected wireless signal towards the desired direction wit h little
energy usage, thus forming passive beamforming to enhance
the transmission performance. It offers a range of advantag es
over the traditional options ( e.g., base station (BS) or relay),
such as no need for signal processing, low energy consumptio n
and hardware cost, convenience for deployment, etc. Thus, R IS
is a promising technology that has been explored to support a
wide range of applications for next-generation wireless sy stems,
such as coverage extension, capacity enhancement, improve d
localization and sensing [4]–[7].
For downlink transmissions, besides the typical dedicated
unicast data transmission to each user, wireless multicast ing
has become increasingly popular to support content distrib ution
and delivery in emerging applications. RIS can be explored t o
enhance multicast transmission performance. In conventio nal
wireless systems, physical-layer multicast beamforming h as
been widely considered an efﬁcient transmission technolog y
The authors are with the Dept. of Electrical, Computer, and S oftware
Engineering, Ontario Tech University, Ontario, Canada. Pr eliminary result of
this work was presented in [1].for the BS to deliver common data to multiple users simulta-
neously. Various optimization algorithms or signal proces sing
techniques have been developed in the literature to provide
design solutions for different transmission scenarios or s ystems
[8]–[14]. For delivering common data to a group, multicast
beamforming performance is typically limited by the user in
the group with the worst channel condition. Such limitation is
dictated by the wireless prorogation environment. RIS can b e
utilized to break this barrier by adding an additional contr ol-
lable channel path. In particular, it can form passive beamf orm-
ing by controlling the phase shifts of the reﬂective element s
to improve the user channel conditions to further enhance
the overall transmission performance. Thus, it is importan t to
explore this potential for RIS-assisted multicast beamfor ming
design.
In conventional systems, downlink multicast beamforming
is a more challenging design problem than multi-user unicas t
beamforming, as the former is in general an NP-hard problem
[8]. This is also the case for the design of RIS-assisted down link
beamforming. RIS-assisted multicast beamforming design h as
recently been investigated for the single-group [15], [16] and
multi-group settings [17]–[20]. Several approaches for jo int BS
and RIS beamforming optimization have been proposed for
either maximizing sum group rate [17], [18], or minimizing
the BS transmit power subject to the user quality-of-servic e
(QoS) target constraints, i.e., the QoS problem [19], [20].
In these works, the alternating optimization (AO) techniqu e
is commonly adopted for joint BS and RIS beamforming
optimization. Depending on the speciﬁc problem formulatio n,
smoothing techniques or SDR-based approaches have been pro -
posed to solve the subproblems in each AO iteration. However ,
some limitations exist in these existing methods. For the Qo S
problem, existing studies are limited, and the efﬁcacy of th e
proposed AO approaches in [19], [20] is uncertain as there is
no guarantee of the quality of the computed solution. Also,
the above existing methods generally have high computation al
complexity, which cannot be effectively implemented for a
large number of RIS elements and BS antennas. Since RIS
is beneﬁcial only when the number of reﬂective elements
becomes large, developing an effective design with both hig h
performance and low computational complexity is crucial.
A. Contribution
In this paper, we consider the RIS-assisted downlink trans-
mission design focusing on the multicast beamforming sce-
nario. We develop our efﬁcient fast algorithms for joint BS a nd
RIS beamforming optimization for both the QoS problem and
the max-min fair (MMF) problem, where the MMF problem
refers to maximizing the weighted minimum SINR among
users subject to the BS transmit power budget. Furthermore,
we generalize our proposed approach and show that it can be2
extended to the unicast beamforming scenario, lending to a f ast
beamforming solution.
Several unique features of our proposed algorithms distin-
guish our work from the existing ones. First, we propose a
fast alternating multicast beamforming (AMBF) approach fo r
the QoS problem. Different from the existing methods that
directly apply AO to this problem, we explore the structure
of the joint BS and RIS beamforming optimization and show
that this QoS problem can be naturally broken down into
two multicast beamforming subproblems, which are solved
alternatingly: a BS multicast beamforming QoS problem and
an RIS passive multicast beamforming MMF problem. This
structure-based AMBF approach can effectively improve the
BS and RIS beamforming solutions over iterations, avoiding
the issue faced in the existing direct AO approaches.
Next, with the two subproblems identiﬁed, we can judi-
ciously exploit the optimal multicast beamforming structu re
[11] to compute a solution efﬁciently for the BS multicast
problem, whose computational complexity does not depend on
the number of BS antennas. This departs from the existing
methods that are purely based on computational optimizatio n
techniques. For the challenging RIS passive multicast MMF
problem, we develop our technique to reformulate the proble m
and adopt a ﬁrst-order projected subgradient algorithm (PS A)
[12] to solve it, which yields computationally cheap closed -
form updates and has a convergence guarantee. Finally, we
show that since our AMBF approach utilizes the structure of
the problem, it is readily applicable to the downlink multi-
user unicast beamforming scenario to compute the solution
efﬁciently. Our fast algorithm is scalable, with computati onal
complexity growing linearly with the number of RIS elements
and the BS antennas.
For the RIS-assisted downlink multicast MMF problem, we
ﬁrst show it is an inverse problem to the earlier QoS problem.
Following this, we utilize the optimal BS beamforming struc -
ture again to transform the MMF problem into an equivalent
problem, which allows us to propose a PSA-based iterative
algorithm to compute the BS and RIS beamforming solutions.
In particular, the algorithm uses closed-form updates per i tera-
tion, leading to a highly computationally efﬁcient solutio n. The
proposed algorithm is also directly applicable to the gener al
downlink RIS-assisted multi-user beamforming problem wit h
the MMF objective.
The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of ou r
proposed algorithms, in terms of the performance and compu-
tational advantage, for both the multicast and unicast scen arios
compared to the alternative methods.
B. Related Work
Multicast beamforming optimization is inherently a non-
convex and NP-hard problem [8]. The earlier literature work s
adopted the semi-deﬁnite relaxation (SDR) approach [8], [9 ]
to ﬁnd an approximate solution. With the number of antennas
increasing, the successive convex approximation (SCA) tec h-
nique has become more attractive for its lower computationa l
complexity and better performance [10]. The optimal multi-
group multicast beamforming structure was recently obtain ed in
[11]. It shows that to obtain the beamforming vectors, we onl y
need to optimize the per-user weight, which is a much smaller
optimization problem that is independent to the number of
BS antennas. This structure has been exploited to develop fa stand scalable algorithms for multicast beamforming in massi ve
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems [12]–[14] .
Several recent works have studied the RIS-assisted multi-
cast beamforming design for the single group [15], [16] and
the general multi-group settings [17]–[20]. Joint BS and RI S
beamforming optimization for maximizing sum group rate is
considered in [17], [18]. In [17], the alternating optimiza tion
(AO) technique is used, and a smoothing technique is pro-
posed along with a majorization minimization method to solv e
the subproblems. In [18], the smoothing technique is applie d
directly to the rate objective, along with a low-complexity
alternating projected gradient algorithm. The QoS problem for
the BS transmit power minimization is studied in [19], where
AO is directly applied to the problem, resulting in a feasibi lity
problem for the RIS passive beamforming design. The SDR-
based approach is then proposed to solve the subproblems. A
similar approach is also considered in [20] for an RIS-assis ted
symbiotic radio multicast system comprising the primary re -
ceivers and an internet-of-things receiver. However, as th e
feasibility problem cannot effectively search for an impro ved
solution over iteration, there is no guarantee of the qualit y of
this AO approach.
The unicast scenario for RIS-assisted downlink multi-user
beamforming has been studied in many recent works. Among
them, only a few works have studied the BS power minimiza-
tion problem [5], [21]. In [5], directly applying AO to the jo int
beamforming optimization problem is ﬁrst considered, and a
low-complexity heuristic method based on the sum of channel
gains is proposed. RIS-assisted non-orthogonal multiple a ccess
(NOMA) network is considered in [21], and the joint beam-
forming design using the direct AO approach is also adopted.
Both [5] and [21] adopt semi-deﬁnite programming (SDP) or
SDR to solve the corresponding alternating subproblems. Th e
minimum rate (or SINR) maximization problem under various
system conﬁgurations has been considered in [22]–[24]. In
[22], an iterative algorithm providing an alternating desc ent
path is proposed. The work in [23] uses asymptotic analysis
and some assumptions for the channel model to provide the
approximations to the optimal BS transmit beamformer. Then ,
a projected gradient ascent algorithm is proposed for the
RIS beamformer based on the large-scale channel statistics .
RIS-assisted multi-cell coordinated transmit beamformin g is
considered in [24], where RIS can adjust both reﬂecting phas es
and amplitudes. The AO approach is adopted, and the second-
order cone programming (SOCPs) and SDR are used to solve
the subproblems. An inexact AO approach with SCA is further
considered to reduce the computational complexity. Howeve r,
these existing approaches generally have computational co m-
plexity.

A. System Model
We consider an RIS-assisted downlink multi-group multicas t
scenario: a BS equipped with Nantennas multicasts messages
toGuser groups, and an RIS consisting of Mpassive reﬂective
elements is deployed to assist the data transmission betwee n the
BS and the users. We assume that group iconsists ofKisingle-
antenna users, and these users receive a common message from
the BS that is independent of other groups. The total number
of users is denoted by Ktot=/summationtextG
i=1Ki. The BS controls the
phases of the RIS array elements via a RIS controller to adjus t
the signals received at the RIS to the desired directions. We
denote the set of group indices by G/defines{1,...,G}, the set of
user indices in group ibyKi/defines{1,...,K i},i∈G, and the
set of RIS element indices by M/defines{1,...,M}.

B. Problem Formulation
We ﬁrst focus on the QoS problem for the RIS-assisted
multicast beamforming design. Our objective is to jointly o pti-
mize the multicast beamforming vectors wiand RIS reﬂection
coefﬁcient vector eto minimize the BS transmit power while
ensuring that the SINR target at each user is met. This joint
optimization problem is formulated as
Po: min

i=1/⌊a∇d⌊lwi/⌊a∇d⌊l2(3a)s.t. SINR ik≥γik, k∈Ki, i∈G (3b)

wherew/defines[wH

ProblemPois a non-convex quadratically constrained
quadratic programming (QCQP) problem. Note that for the
conventional downlink transmission without RIS, the multi cast
beamforming problem is already known to be NP-hard in
its general form. The joint optimization problem Pois even
more challenging with the additional RIS passive beamforme r
eaffecting SINR ikto be optimized under the non-convex
constraints in (3c) imposed. Furthermore, since the number of
RIS elements Mis expected to be large to show beneﬁt, Po
is typically a large-scale problem. Thus, our goal is to deve lop
an effective computational method to provide a solution wit h
high performance but low computational complexity.
III. RIS- ASSISTED MULTICAST BEAMFORMING DESIGN
We consider the alternating optimization (AO) technique
to solvePo,i.e., solvingPowith respect to (w.r.t.) the BS
multicast beamformer wand RIS passive beamformer eal-
ternatingly. However, directly applying AO to Pois not an
effective method. This is because the objective function in Po
is only a function of w. With given w,Pois reduced to a
feasibility problem w.r.t. e, for which the value of efrom
the previous AO iteration is already a feasible solution. Th us,
the algorithm could get stuck at the value of (w,e)after the
ﬁrst round of updates, and the quality of this solution merel y
depends on the quality of the initial point.
In our approach, we ﬁrst analyze the structure of Pow.r.t.
wandeand then utilize it to devise an effective algorithm to
solve this QoS problem.
A. QoS Problem Reformulation
To explore the structural relation between wandeinPo,
we ﬁrst convert the set of SINR constraints in (3b) into the
following equivalent constraint:
SINRik≥γik,∀k,∀i⇔SINRik
γik≥1,∀k,∀i
⇔min
i,kSINRik
γik≥1. (4)
We can replace (3b) with (4) and equivalently rewrite Poas
P1: min
w,eG/summationdisplay
i=1/⌊a∇d⌊lwi/⌊a∇d⌊l2(5a)
s.t.min
i,kSINRik
γik≥1 (5b)
|em|2= 1, m∈M. (5c)
Noticing that RIS passive beamforming vector eonly affects
SINRik’s in (5b), we can combine (5b) and (5c) and further
transformP1into the following equivalent problem:
P2: min
wG/summationdisplay
i=1/⌊a∇d⌊lwi/⌊a∇d⌊l2(6a)
s.t. max
e:|em|2=1,m∈Mmin
i,kSINRik
γik≥1. (6b)
Note that for showing the equivalence, it is straightforwar d to
showP1andP2have the same feasible set.4
ComparingP2withPo, we see that the original set of SINR
constraints in (3b) is replaced by the constraint in (6b). Th e left-
hand side of (6b) is a max-min weighted SINRs optimization
problem w.r.t. e, and the unit-modulus constraints on ein (3c)
are now the constraints for this max-min optimization probl em.
B. Alternating Multicast Beamforming Approach
Once transforming PointoP2, we notice thatP2inher-
ently contains two optimization subproblems w.r.t. wande,
respectively. As we will show below, these two subproblems
are essentially two types of multicast beamforming problem s:
1) BS multicast beamforming QoS problem w.r.t. w; 2) RIS
passive multicast beamforming MMF problem w.r.t. e. Follow-
ing this, we naturally break down P2into two subproblems
to solve alternatingly. Our overall proposed alternating m ulti-
cast beamforming (AMBF) approach includes two steps: the
alternating optimization step and a ﬁnal processing step. T he
ﬁnal processing step is to ensure a feasible solution to Po.
Below, we will ﬁrst describe the two subproblems and the ﬁnal
processing step, leaving the fast algorithm design for solv ing
the subproblems to Sections IV-A and IV-B.
1) BS Multicast Beamforming QoS Problem for w:For
given RIS passive beamforming vector e,Pois reduced to the
following BS multicast beamforming problem w.r.t. w:
Pe: min
wG/summationdisplay
i=1/⌊a∇d⌊lwi/⌊a∇d⌊l2(7a)
s.t. SINR ik≥γik, k∈Ki, i∈G. (7b)
ProblemPeis a typical downlink multi-group multicast beam-
forming QoS problem. The effective channel between the BS
and userkin groupiconsists of the direct path and the RIS-
path given by hd
ik+Gike, as shown in SINR ikin (2).
2) RIS Passive Multicast Beamforming MMF Problem for
e:Optimizing RIS passive beamformer ewith given wis the
main challenge in Po. As discussed earlier, directly applying
AO to the original problem Pois not effective. However, once
we convertPointoP2, for given w, we naturally have the
following optimization problem w.r.t. e, which is to maximize
the minimum ratio of the received SINR over its target, or the
weighted SINR, i.e.,SINRik/γik:
Sw: max
emin
i,kSINRik
γik(8a)
s.t.|em|2= 1, m∈M. (8b)
Remark 1. Note thatSwcan be viewed as a weighted MMF
single-group multicast beamforming problem, with ebeing
the beamformer to all the users in the system. However, this
problem has three key differences from the conventional MMF
multicast problem: i)This single-group multicast beamforming
problem contains self-interference, as eappears in the denomi-
nator of SINR ikin (2). ii)From the point of view of optimizing
e, SINR ikin (2) can in fact be interpreted as the signal-to-
leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) for user kin groupi. Thus,
the MMF problem Sww.r.t.eis based on an SLNR metric. iii)
Different from the conventional transmit power constraint , the
constraints in (8b) can be viewed as a non-convex per-elemen t
power constraint, where each element is required to consume
exactly one unit of power.
Due to the difference discussed above, Swis a more chal-
lenging problem to solve than the conventional MMF problem,which is a non-convex QCQP problem that is NP-hard. To
tackle this problem, we note that the constraints in (8b) are
equivalent to
|em|2≤1,m∈M;eTe=M. (9)
Thus, we replace the constraints in (8b) with (9) and transfo rm
Swinto the following equivalent problem:
Seq
w: max
emin
i,kSINRik
γik(10a)
s.t.|em|2≤1, m∈M (10b)
eTe=M. (10c)
To make the problem more tractable, we relax Seq
wby
transferring the constraint in (10c) into the objective fun ction
in (10a) as a penalty term with a penalty weight ζ >0. The
relaxed problem is given by
/tildewideSw: max
e/parenleftbigg
min
i,kSINRik
γik/parenrightbigg
+ζeHe
M(11a)
s.t.|em|2≤1, m∈M. (11b)
Remark 2. The penalty term in (11a) is to ensure that eTeis as
close toMas possible in solving /tildewideSw. Note that we choose the
penalty term in this form such that the two terms in the object ive
function are both normalized. In particular, for the weight ed
SINR term, using (w,e)fromPe, we have mini,kSINRik
γik= 1
based on (7b). Thus, we expect this term to be close to 1,
especially as the AO iteration between Peand/tildewideSwconverges.
The RIS passive beamformer norm term satisﬁeseHe
M≤1
based on (10b), and it is also expected to be close to 1as the
AO iteration converges. In this way, the two terms in (11a)
have comparable values that are both around 1, which are not
affected by the actual values of SINR or /⌊a∇d⌊le/⌊a∇d⌊l2for a speciﬁc
setup. This simpliﬁes the tuning of penalty parameter ζ, which
can remain the same for different system conﬁgurations.
Although /tildewideSwis still a non-convex QCQP problem, compared
withSw, it is more amenable to efﬁcient algorithm design to
compute a solution, which will be discussed in Section IV-B.
Thus, following the above, the ﬁrst step in our AMBF
approach is to solve the two multicast beamforming problems
alternatingly, i.e.,Pefor the BS beamformers {wi}and/tildewideSw
for the RIS beamformer e.
3) Final Processing: Let(w⋆,e⋆)denote the solution after
the above iterative procedure. Since /tildewideSwis a relaxed problem
ofSw,(w⋆,e⋆)may not be feasible to Po. Thus, based on
(w⋆,e⋆), we have the ﬁnal processing step to obtain the feasible
solution(wﬁnal,eﬁnal)as follows:
•Projecte⋆onto its feasible set: eﬁnal= exp(j∠e⋆), which
represents taking the phase component of each element in
e⋆.
•SolvePeﬁnalwitheﬁnaland obtain wﬁnal.
IV. F AST ALGORITHMS FOR THE AMBF A PPROACH
In this section, we propose our fast algorithms to solve
subproblemsPeand/tildewideSw.
A. Fast Algorithm for BS Multicast Beamforming Pe
As mentioned earlier, Peis a typical downlink multicast
beamforming QoS problem. Deﬁne ˜hik/defineshd

N×1equivalent channel from BS to user kin groupithat5
includes both the direct path and the RIS path. The received
SINR at user kin groupiin (2) can be rewritten as
SINRik=|wH
i˜hik|2
/summationtextG
j/negationslash=i|wH
j˜hik|2+σ2, k∈Ki,i∈G. (12)
Although the QoS problem Peis known to be a challenging
non-convex QCQP problem, the structure of the optimal solu-
tion is obtained in [11], which can be utilized to compute the
beamforming solution wwith high computational efﬁciency,
especially when the number of BS antennas is large M≫1.
We directly employ this optimal structure to compute w.
Speciﬁcally, the optimal wiis a weighted MMSE beamforming
given by [11]
wi=R−1(λ)/tildewideHiai, i∈G (13)
where/tildewideHi/defines[˜hi1,...,˜hiK]is the equivalent channel matrix
for groupi,aiis theK×1optimal weight vector for group

the group, and R(λ)/definesI+/summationtextG

k=1λikγik˜hik˜hikis the
noise-plus-weighted-channel covariance matrix with λikbeing
the optimal Lagrange multipliers associated with the SINR
constraint in (7b) and λbeing the vector containing all λo
ik’s.
The solution wiin (13) is given in a semi-closed form
withλand{ai}to be numerically determined. Although the
optimal value for λis difﬁcult to obtain, an algorithm to
compute (suboptimal) values of λefﬁciently using the ﬁxed-
point method is proposed in [11]. With the optimal structure
ofwiin (13) and λ,Pecan be transformed into a weight
optimization problem w.r.t. weight vectors {ai}, which is a
much smaller problem with/summationtextG
i=1Kivariables compared to
the original problem PewithGN variables for N≫Ki.
To solve this non-convex weight optimization problem for
{ai}, we can adopt the SCA approach discussed in [11].
Further improvement in the computational efﬁciency can be
considered by adopting the fast ADMM algorithm proposed
recently in [13] based on the optimal structure, which provi des
each SCA update using closed-form expressions with ultra-l ow
complexity. We omit the details and refer the readers to [11] ,
[13] for these algorithms.
B. Fast Algorithm for RIS Passive Multicast Beamforming /tildewideSw
Problem /tildewideSwis expected to be large-size, since the number
of RIS elements is large ( M≫1). Existing methods in the
literature for solving eoften adopt SDR or SCA [17], [20], but
suffer from high computational complexity. It is essential to
develop an effective low-complexity algorithm to ﬁnd a solu tion
to/tildewideSw, especially when this subproblem needs to be solved in
each AO iteration.
From Remark 1, we note that /tildewideSwis a variant of the MMF
problem. PSA is a fast ﬁrst-order algorithm recently propos ed
in [12] to solve the multi-group multicast beamforming MMF
problem in the conventional system. Although the form of the
objective function and the constraints in /tildewideSware different from
those of the conventional MMF problem considered in [12], th e
method can still be adapted to solve /tildewideSw. Thus, we propose to
apply PSA to /tildewideSwto compute a near-stationary solution of /tildewideSw
efﬁciently.1) Problem Reformulation: Based on the objective function

solution to the inner maximization problem in /tildewideS′

2) The Projected Subgradient Algorithm: Note thatf(e,y)
is concave in ybut non-convex in e. Thus, problem /tildewideS′
wis
a non-convex-concave min-max problem, which is typically
NP-hard. Furthermore, the objective function maxy∈Yf(e,y)
may not be differentiable. To solve /tildewideS′, we notice that /tildewideS′has
the same structure as the min-max problem considered in [12]
(i.e.,with objective function f(e,y)/definesφT(e)yand a convex
feasible set). Thus, we adopt PSA in [12] to ﬁnd a near-
stationary point of /tildewideS′
w.
Speciﬁcally, PSA is an iterative algorithm, with the updati ng
procedure at iteration jgiven by1

In (17),y(j)can be obtained by ﬁnding index ˆiˆksuch that

compute the gradient ∇ef(e,y(j))in (18), with a slight abuse
of notation to ease our presentation, we use φik(e)to represent
φi′k′(e)obtained in (17). Then, ∇ef(e,y(j))has the following

Thus, PSA is computationally cheap and is particularly suit able
for solving /tildewideSwwith a large value of M. Furthermore, the
convergence analysis of PSA in [12] is applicable to our
problem. It shows that the above PSA procedure is guaranteed
to converge in ﬁnite time to a point at the vicinity of a statio nary
point of /tildewideSw.
C. Discussion on the AMBF Algorithm
We summarize our proposed fast AMBF algorithm for the
RIS-assisted multicast QoS problem Poin Algorithm 1. It
consists of the proposed AMBF approach in Section III-B
and the fast algorithms in Sections IV-A and IV-B for each
subproblem. A few aspects of the algorithm are discussed
below:
1) Initialization: The AMBF algorithm requires an initial
feasible point e0that satisﬁes the constraints in (3c) for the
BS multicast beamforming subproblem Pe. It can be easily
obtained by generating a random phase for each element in e0.
In each AO iteration n, solving ˜Swby PSA also requires an
initial point e(0)for the update in (17). We should set e(0)=
en, which is from the previous AO iteration and is also used
inPein the current AO iteration.
2) Computational Complexity: Algorithm 1 consists of solv-
ing two optimization subproblems Peand/tildewideSwat each AO
iteration. We discuss the computational complexity for sol ving
each subproblem below:
a) ProblemPe:As mentioned in Section IV-A, using
the optimal beamforming structure win (13),Peis converted
into the weight optimization problem w.r.t. {ai}with total
Ktot(=/summationtextG
i=1Ki)variables, which can be solved by SCA [11].
If each SCA subproblem is solved using a typical interior poi nt
method [25] by the standard convex solver, the computationa l
complexity is O(K3
tot)per SCA iteration, which does not grow
with either MorN. We point out that this computational
complexity can be further reduced by using the fast ADMM al-
gorithm proposed recently in [26], which only involves clos ed-
form updates and has the computational complexity in the ord er
ofO(K2
tot).
b) ProblemSw:The problem is solved using PSA up-
dates in (17) and (18) per iteration. Obtaining y(j)in (17)
involves computing SINR ikin (2) for all Ktotusers and
ﬁnding the maximum φik(e), which requires GK tot(N+1)+
Ktot(MN+N+ 4) ﬂops. The required computation in (18)
is mainly at computing the gradient ∇ef(e,y(j))in (20). We
note that all the terms in (20), i.e.,qjˆiˆk,Iˆiˆk(e), andSˆiˆk(e)arepart of the SINR expression that has already been computed.
Thus, calculating∇eφˆiˆk(e)only requires 2GM+ 2Mﬂops.
Thus, the entire updates per iteration requires GK tot(N+1)+
Ktot(MN+N+ 1) + 2GM+ 2Mﬂops, with the leading
complexity being KtotN(G+M)ﬂops. As typically we expect
M≫G, the leading computational complexity is KtotNM .
Thus, the complexity of PSA grows linearly over M,N, and
Ktot. The complexity of the ﬁnal per-element projection in (19)
isO(M). Thus, the overall computational complexity in each
AO iteration of Algorithm 1 is as low as O(K2
tot+KtotMN),
which is linear in both MandN.
3) Convergence: For solvingPeand/tildewideSwalternatingly, note
that the objective of the minimization problem Peis lower
bounded and that of the maximization problem /tildewideSwis upper
bounded. Thus, the alternating procedure is guaranteed to
converge.
V. G ENERALIZATION TO RIS-A SSISTED MULTI -USER
DOWNLINK BEAMFORMING
ProblemPoin fact represents the general formulation of
downlink RIS-assisted multi-user beamforming QoS problem
that includes both multicast and unicast transmission scen arios.
Unicast transmission is the most commonly considered scena rio
in the downlink, where the BS sends data dedicated to each
user. It is a special case of multicast beamforming when K= 1
for each group, and the multicast beamforming problem is
reduced to the conventional unicast beamforming for Gusers.
Thus, our proposed AMBF algorithm in Algorithm 1 can
be directly used to solve the RIS-assisted multi-user unica st
beamforming problem.
More importantly, we note that the transformed problem P2
in (6) reﬂects the general RIS-assisted downlink beamformi ng
problem for either unicast or multicast transmissions. As a
result, the AMBF approach in Section III-B to alternatingly
solve the BS beamforming problem Peand the RIS passive
beamforming problem Swis applicable in both scenarios.
So far, we have focused on the multicast beamforming
problemPoforK >1, which is a more challenging problem
to solve than the unicast beamforming problem. For the unica st
scenario, the RIS beamforming problem Swis still a multicast
beamforming MMF problem as discussed in Remark 1 of
Section III-B2, which can be efﬁciently solved by our propos ed
algorithm in Section IV-B. On the other hand, Peis reduced
to the conventional BS multi-user beamforming problem w.r. t.
w[27], which yields a closed-form optimal solution as brieﬂy
described below.
ForK= 1, we directly denote the single user in group i∈G
as useri, with a total of Gusers. The optimal beamforming
solutionwiin (13) still holds as a special case, where the
equivalent channel matrix /tildewideHifor groupiis reduced to the
equivalent channel ˜hifor useri, and weight vector ainow
becomes a scalar, denoted as ai,i.e.,
wi=aiR−1(λ)˜hi, i∈G. (21)
The weights{ai}for allGusers can be derived in closed-
form. This is because when the transmit beamformer can be
individually designed for each user, at the optimality, all SINR
constraints in (5b) is attained with equality. Speciﬁcally , let
ci/definesR−1(λ)/tildewidehi1,i∈G, and we have the following the SINR
equality constraint

equations in (22) can be compactly written as
˜a=σ2V−11 (24)
where1is an all-one vector.
Finally, without the loss of optimality, we obtain
ai=/radicalbig
[˜a]i, i∈G. (25)
Thus, the joint optimization of (w,e)forPoby the AMBF
approach involves alternating between computing the close d-
form solution wiin (21) and solving /tildewideSwforeusing the updates
in (17) and (18).
Remark 3. RIS-assisted downlink multi-user beamforming
design for the unicast scenario has been studied in many rece nt
works. However, only a few of them considered the QoS
problem for transmit power minimization [5], [21]. Perhaps
partially this is due to the difﬁculty in using AO effectivel y
to solve the joint BS and RIS beamforming problem. In [5],
directly applying AO to the joint BS and RIS beamforming to
minimize the BS transmit power is considered. As discussed
at the beginning of Section III, direct AO renders the RIS
beamforming a feasibility problem, which can not provide an
effective solution. Thus, some modiﬁcation to the feasibil ity
problem is proposed to ﬁnd a better solution, and a low-
complexity heuristic method based on the sum of channel gain s
is also proposed. The joint beamforming design for RIS-assi sted
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks is consid-
ered in [21], where the direct AO approach is also adopted, wi th
the RIS beamforming being treated as a feasibility problem.
Both [5] and [21] adopt SDP or SDR to solve the corresponding
alternating subproblems. In our work, we ﬁrst transform the
QoS problem into P2in (6). It allows us to break the problem
into two subproblems, for which AO is effective in obtaining a
good solution. The subproblems can be solved by the closed-
form solution in (21) and the fast algorithm in Section IV-B,
which is a scalable solution for large-scale systems.
VI. RIS-A SSISTED MULTICAST MMF P ROBLEM
We now consider the weighted max-min fair (MMF) design
for the RIS-assisted multicast scenario. The objective is t o
maximize the minimum weighted SINR among users, subject to
the BS transmit power budget and the unit-modulus constrain t
for the RIS elements. The weighted SINR is the ratio between
SINR and a pre-speciﬁed SINR target, which sets certain
fairness among users. This joint optimization problem w.r. t.w
andeis formulated as

wherePis the transmit power budget. Similar to the QoS
problemPo, problemSois also non-convex and NP-hard.For the conventional downlink multicast beamforming desig n
at the BS, it is known that the QoS and MMF problems are
inverse problems [28]: the role of the objective function an d
the constraints are switched in the two problems, and we can
solve the MMF problem by iteratively solving the QoS problem
along with a bi-section search over the minimum SINR target
for the QoS problem until the total transmit power meets the
power budget in the MMF problem. Naturally, we want to
know whether such a relation also holds for the RIS-assisted
multicast beamforming design, which now also includes the
RIS passive beamformer optimization, in addition to the BS
transmit beamformers. We show below that this is indeed the
case.
Proposition 1. For RIS-assisted multicast beamforming, the
QoS problemPoand the MMF problem Soare inverse prob-
lems. In particular, we explicitly parameterize SoasSo(γ,P)
for given γandPwith the maximum objective value denoted as
to=So(γ,P), and we also parameterize PoasPo(γ)withγ
being the SINR target vector, and the minimum power obtained
asP=Po(γ). Then,Po(γ)andSo(γ,P)have the following
relations:
to=So(γ,Po(toγ)), P=Po(So(γ,P)γ). (27)
Proof: See Appendix A.
Based on the above relation, we can solve the MMF problem
Sousing Algorithm 1. In particular, by the relation in (27), So
can be solved by solving its inverse QoS problem Poiteratively
along with a bi-section search for to. However, since the size of
the RIS reﬂection elements is typically large M≫1, iteratively
solvingPowill incur relatively high computational complexity.
We need a more computationally efﬁcient algorithm to solve
the large-scale joint optimization problem So. Aiming at this
goal, we present a fast algorithm to solve Sodirectly.
A. Proposed Fast Algorithm for Solving So
For the conventional downlink scenario without RIS, as
mentioned in Section IV-B, PSA is proposed in [12] to obtain
a near-stationary solution for the multicast beamforming M MF
problem. Below, we show that we can adopt PSA to solve
the MMF problem efﬁciently for the RIS-assisted multicast
scenario directly as well.
From Proposition 1, problems PoandSoare the inverse
problems. This means the optimal structure of the BS multica st
beamformer wstill has the form given in (13). Indeed, with
givene, if we treat the RIS-assisted channel between the
BS and user kin groupias the equivalent channel ˜hik,So
reduces to the conventional multicast MMF problem, for whic h
the optimal beamforming structure is (13) [11]. However, th e
challenge for the MMF problem is that computing λinR(λ)
is not straightforward. Fortunately, the asymptotic expre ssion
ofR(λ)for largeNis obtained in closed form in [11], which
can be used as an approximate expression of R(λ)to further
simplify the computation. Speciﬁcally, let ˜hiK=/radicalBig
˜βikgik
where˜βikrepresents the large-scale channel variance and
˜gik∼CN(0,I). Then, the asymptotic expression of R(λ)has
the following simple closed form

is the harmonic mean of
the large-scale channel variance of all users. Using /tildewideRin (28),
we can replace wiin (13) with the following expression:
wi≈/tildewideR−1/tildewideHiai, i∈G. (29)
Below, we develop our fast algorithm to solve Sobased on wi
in (29) to reduce the computational complexity.
Usingwiin (29), we ﬁrst convert Sointo a joint optimization

into the following problem by moving the equality constrain t

Problem /tildewideSois similar to /tildewideSwin (11), except that /tildewideSois
a joint optimization problem for (a,e)while/tildewideSwis fore

stationary joint solution (a,e)for/tildewideSoefﬁciently, similar to
Section IV-B, as shown below.

2) The Projected Subgradient Algorithm: Problem /tildewideS′
ois a
non-convex-concave min-max problem, whose structure is th e
same as/tildewideS′
win (16). Thus, we can apply PSA with the updating
steps similar to (17) and (18). In particular, the updating
procedure at iteration jis given by
y(j)∈argmax
y∈Yg(x(j),y); (34)
x(j+1)= ΠU/parenleftbig
x(j)−η∇xg(x(j),y(j))/parenrightbig
(35)whereη>0is the step size, and ΠU(x)is the projection of x
onto the feasible set U. Since the constraints on aandeinU

SinceYis a probability simplex, an optimal solution to the

g(x,y(j)) =ϕˆiˆk(x) = max

From the above, we note that the updates in (34) and (35)
can be computed using closed-form evaluations.
3) Final Processing: Since we are solving /tildewideSo, which is
a relaxed problem of So, the computed solution e⋆may not
satisfy (26c) forSo. Thus, we require this ﬁnal processing step
to obtain a feasible solution to So. Letx⋆= [a⋆H,e⋆H]Hbe
the solution produced by the updating procedure in (34) and
(35). Ife⋆does not satisfy (26c), we have the following step
to obtain a feasible solution based on (a⋆,e⋆):
•Projecte⋆onto its feasible set: eﬁnal= exp(j∠e⋆), which
takes the phase component of each element in e⋆;

the PSA-based fast algorithm for this MMF problem is
provided in [12]. We directly apply this algorithm to
compute the solution aﬁnaltoSeq(eﬁnal). For initialization
in this algorithm, we use a⋆as a good initial point9

We summarize our proposed fast algorithm for the MMF
problemSoin Algorithm 2. Again, based on the existing
convergence analysis [12], the PSA updating procedure in (3 4)
and (35) is guaranteed to converge in ﬁnite time to a point at
the vicinity of a stationary point for /tildewideSo.
B. Discussions
1) Initialization: The proposed updating procedure in (34)
and (35) requires an initial point x(0)= [a(0)H,e(0)H]H. This
initial point can be generated randomly, as the projection ( 35)
will ensure that the subsequent points {x(n)}are feasible.
However, a good initial point improves the rate of convergen ce.
Thus, instead of a random initial point, we consider the
following approach.
We ﬁrst generate e(0)with a random phase for each element.
Givene(0),Seq
oin (30) is reduced to the MMF problem w.r.t.

equivalently written as

γik≥t, k∈Ki,i∈G (42a)
G/summationdisplay
i=1/⌊a∇d⌊l/tildewideCiai/⌊a∇d⌊l2≤P. (42b)
Note that any feasible solution to the above problem is feasi ble
to/tildewideSo. Thus, we generate a(0)in an attempt to solve this MMF
problem, which is to solve its inverse problem, i.e., the QoS
problem similar to Pein (7) for given t, along with bi-section
search over t[11], [28]. However, since our goal is only to
generate a feasible point a(0)for/tildewideSo, we only need to solve the
QoS problem2along with one round of bi-section search over
tto obtain the initial point a(0).
2) Computational Complexity: For the updates in (34) and
(35) at each iteration, the update y(j)is obtained in (37) by
ﬁnding the maximum ϕik(e)amongKtotusers, which requires
GK tot(N+ 1) +Ktot(MN+ 2N+ 4) ﬂops. The update in
(35) requires to calculate ∇aϕˆiˆk(x)and∇eϕˆiˆk(x). Note that
∇eϕˆiˆk(x)is computed using (20), which requires 2GM+2M
ﬂops as discussed in Section IV-C2.ii). To compute ∇aiϕˆiˆk(x)
in (40), we need aH
j/tildewideCH
j˜hˆiˆkforj∈G, which is part of the SINR
expression that has already been computed in ϕik(e). We also
need to calculate /tildewideCH

i˜hˆiˆk˜hH
ˆiˆk/tildewideCiai, for
i∈G. Note that /tildewideCi’s only need to be computed once before
the update procedure, and ˜hˆiˆkis already computed as part of

Gaussian randomization procedure.the SINR expression. Thus, compute /tildewideAiˆiˆkai’s fori∈Grequire
Ktot(N+1). Lastly, we need Ktot+Gﬂops to calculate the ﬁnal
value of∇aiϕˆiˆk(x)for allai’s. In summary, the complexity in
obtaining the update in (35) requires 2(G+1)M+Ktot(N+2)+
Gﬂops. Thus, the overall leading complexity of the updating
procedure in each PSA iteration is dominated by computing
y(j)in (37), which is GK totN+KtotMN ﬂops. It grows linearly
withMandN.

(Algorithm 2) is directly applicable to the general downlin k
RIS-assisted multi-user beamforming problem with the max-
min fair objective for both unicast and multicast scenarios .
Speciﬁc to the unicast case with Ki= 1,∀i, the computational
complexity per iteration in the proposed iterative algorit hm
is reduced to GMN+G2Nﬂops, which is computationally
cheap.
For the multi-user unicast scenario, the MMF problem for
RIS-assisted downlink beamforming under various system se t-
tings has been considered in the recent literature, and vari ous
approaches have been proposed [22]–[24]. In [22], for the
same setting considered in this work, an iterative algorith m that
provides an alternating descent path is proposed to maximiz e
the minimum SINR, and the computational complexity in each
iteration asO((GN)3+M4). In comparison, the computational
complexity of our proposed fast algorithm only grows linear ly
withG,M, andN. A different system model for RIS-assisted
transmission is considered in [23], where only the RIS path
is available and the channel correlation matrix between RIS
and users are assumed to be the same. Using an approximation
of the optimal BS transmit beamformer, the authors propose
an algorithm based on projected gradient ascent to obtain th e
RIS beamformer based on the large-scale channel statistics . The
computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is in th e
higher polynomial order of NandM. RIS-assisted multi-cell
coordinated transmit beamforming is considered in [24], wh ere
the RIS can adjust both reﬂecting phases and amplitudes. The
AO approach is adopted, with two subproblems being solved
by the second-order cone programming (SOCP) and SDR. An
inexact AO approach with SCA is further considered to reduce
the computational complexity. However, since these propos ed
approaches are second-order algorithms, their computatio nal
complexity is still high.
VII. S IMULATION RESULTS
We consider a downlink RIS-assisted transmission scenario
with a BS and an RIS. The locations of the BS and the
RIS using the (x,y,z)-coordinates in meters are (0,0,0)and
(70,70,0), respectively. The RIS is a rectangular surface with
the array elements placed on the (y,z)-plane. The users are
located randomly within a circle centered at the RIS with a
radius of 20m on the (x,y)-plane. We set the target SINR
γik=γ,∀i,k. Unless speciﬁed otherwise, our default system
setup is given as N= 16 antennas at the BS, and M= 10×10
reﬂective elements at the RIS, G= 2 groups,Ki=K= 2
users,∀i.
We assume a line-of-sight (LOS) channel between the BS

whereβr

toσ2=−100dBm.
For the QoS problem, we set the penalty parameter in
subproblem /tildewideSwtoζ= 0.1, and the step size for the PSA
updates in (18) as α= 10 . For the MMF problem, we set the
penalty parameter in /tildewideSotoδ= 0.1, and the step size for the
updates in (35) as η= 1.3
A. Convergence Behavior of the Proposed Algorithms
We ﬁrst study the convergence behavior of our proposed
AMBF algorithm in Algorithm 1 for the QoS problem Po,
which alternatingly solves two multicast subproblems at th e
BS and the RIS using our proposed fast algorithms. Fig. 1a
shows the convergence behavior of solving subproblem /tildewideSw
using PSA in a speciﬁc iteration of the AMBF algorithm. The
convergence behavior for three random channel realization s are
shown. We see PSA converges after 1000∼2000 iterations.
Note that the closed-form updates for PSA in each iteration
is computationally cheap, and thus, the overall computatio n
time for 1000∼2000 iterations is fast. Furthermore, denote
the total transmit power at the BS as Ptot=/summationtextG
i=1/⌊a∇d⌊lwi/⌊a∇d⌊l2.
3We have conducted extensive experiments using different va lues ofζ,α,δ,
andη, and found that ζ=δ= 0.1,α= 10 , andη= 1 in general provide
the best balance between the performance and the convergenc e rate.0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500

Fig. 1b shows the trajectory of Ptotover iterations by Algorithm
1 for three random channel realizations. We observe that our
proposed AMBF approach converges within about 6∼12
iterations, which is relatively fast, especially given tha t we use
fast algorithms for computing the solution to each subprobl em.
Fig. 2 shows the convergence behavior of the MMF problem
Sosolved by Algorithm 2 under three random channel real-
izations. We see that for two channel realizations, Algorit hm
2 converges very fast within just a few iterations. Even for a
worse scenario under the third channel realization, Algori thm
2 converges after 800iterations. Note that the PSA updates in
each iteration is closed-form and computationally cheap.
B. Performance Comparison for the QoS Problem
We now evaluate the performance of our proposed AMBF
algorithm in Algorithm 1. For performance comparison, we
consider the following methods:
i) No RIS: A conventional downlink multicast scenario
without the RIS.
ii) Random RIS: Apply random phase-shift for the RIS
elements in e. With given e, solve the BS multicast
beamforming problem Peforw.
iii) Direct AO [19]: Apply the AO approach directly to the
QoS problemPo, where the subproblem w.r.t. eis a
feasibility problem with the SINR constraints in (3b) and
the unit-modulus constraints in (3c).
iv) AMBF-SDR: Apply Algorithm 1, except that instead of
solving subproblem ˜Sww.r.t.e, we relaxSeq

the constraint in (10c) and solve the relaxed problem:

v) AMBF-SCA: Similar to AMBF-SDR that apply Algo-
rithm 1, except that we solve SRelaxed
w by SCA with bi-
section search over t. In particular, we convexify SRelaxed
w
into a sequence of convex approximation problems and
solved them using a standard convex solver.
vi) IP Method: Apply MATLAB non-linear optimization
solverFmincon toPo. It uses the interior-point (IP)
algorithm to solve Po.
1) Performance over the Number of RIS elements M:Fig. 3
shows the total BS transmit power Ptotvs. the number of
RIS elements Mby different methods, for the target SINR
γ= 10 dB. We see that the BS transmit power for random
RIS, direct AO, and IP Method remain roughly ﬂat as M
increases. This indicates that they do not provide an effect ive
RIS beamforming solution. In contrast, under Algorithm 1, t he
resulting BS transmit power is reduced substantially by 4dB as
Mincreases from 25 to 300. RIS-SCA has a nearly identical
performance to Algorithm 1, while RIS-SDR performs worse
than Algorithm 1 with a noticeable gap as large as 2dB. This is
expected, as SDR is an approximation method with a degraded
performance when there are many constraints, and the proble m
size is relatively large.
We also compare the average computation time of different
algorithms in Table I. The computational advantage of Algo-
rithm 1 over RIS-SDR, RIS-SCA, and IP Method as the number
of RIS elements Mincreases is clearly observed, demonstrating
the scalability of Algorithm 1 over M. In particular, the
computational complexity of Algorithm 1 only grows mildly
withM. Thus, Algorithm 1 provides both the best performance
and the fastest computational time than the other three meth ods,
especially for the large value of M.
2) Performance over Target SINR γ:Fig. 4 shows Ptotvs.
target SINR γby different methods. We see that direct AO,
Random RIS, and IP method provide either no or only very
small improvement over the case of No RIS. A substantial
gain can be achieved when the RIS passive beamforming
is effectively optimized to improve the channel environmen t
between the BS and users. In particular, our proposed Algo-0 2 4 6 8 10 12

γ≥4dB. Similar to Fig. 3, RIS-SCA has nearly identical
performance to Algorithm 1, while RIS-SDR performs worse
than Algorithm 1 with a noticeable 2∼3dB gap.
C. Performance Comparison for the MMF Problem
We now evaluate the proposed RIS-assisted multicast beam-
forming design for the MMF problem. For performance com-
parison, besides our proposed Algorithm 2, we consider the
following methods:
1) No RIS: A conventional downlink multi-group multicast
scenario without RIS.
2) Random RIS: Apply random phase-shift for the RIS
elements in e. With given e, solve the BS multicast
beamforming MMF problem for w.
3) Relaxed RIS-MMF: Only solve the relaxed problem /tildewideSo
in (31), i.e.,Algorithm 2 without the ﬁnal processing step
to obtain the feasible solution e. We use this method to
measure the performance loss in the ﬁnal processing step
in Algorithm 2 and quantify how good the relaxed prob-
lem/tildewideSois as an approximation of the original problem
So.
4) IP Method: Use MATLAB non-linear optimization solver
Fmincon to solve the MMF problem So.
5) The alternating projected gradient (APG) method [18]:
APG is a recently proposed iterative algorithm to max-
imize the achievable sum group-rate of all groups. The
group rate is deﬁned as the minimum rate among users
in the group, which corresponds to the minimum SINR
in the group.
Note that the design objective for the APG method [18]
is different from the max-min SINR (or rate) objective in
our MMF problem. However, for the single-group multicast
scenario when G= 1, the two objectives becomes identical.
Since there are no existing RIS-assisted methods designed
for the MMF problem, we compare Algorithm 2 with APG
in this special single-group case. Besides [18], we note tha t
[17] has also proposed the RIS-assisted multicast beamform ing
algorithms for the sum-group-rate maximization. Since it i s
shown in [18] that APG outperforms the method in [17] in both
performance and computational complexity, we choose APG as
the state-of-the-art method for comparison.
In the following simulation results, we set the BS transmit
powerP= 10 dBm.
1) Multiple Groups: Fig. 5 shows the average minimum
SINR vs. the number of RIS elements Mby different methods
forN= 30 . We see that the minimum SINR achieved by12

Algorithm 2
Fig. 6: Average minimum SINR vs. N(M= 100 ,(G,K) = (2,2)).
Algorithm 2 increases noticeably as Mincreases, signiﬁcantly
better than random RIS and IP Method, especially when
M > N . This demonstrates the effectiveness of Algorithm 2
to design RIS beamforming to improve the user channel condi-
tions. Furthermore, we see that Algorithm 2 and Relaxed RIS-
MMF provide a nearly identical performance for all values of
M. This indicates that the solution to /tildewideSoin Algorithm 2 is
mostly feasible to So, and the ﬁnal processing step causes a
negligible performance loss. This also demonstrates that t he
relaxed problem /tildewideSois a good approximation of the original
problemSo.
Fig. 6 shows the average minimum SINR vs. the number
of BS antennas Nby different methods for M= 100 . Again,
we see that the gain of random RIS and IP Method over no
RIS is very small. Our Algorithm 2 provides about 1.5∼2
dB additional SINR gain over these methods for different
values ofN. In Fig. 7, we show the average minimum SINR
vs. the number of users Kper group for N= 30 and
M= 100 . Algorithm 2 outperforms no RIS, random RIS,
and IP Method for all values of K, especially for smaller
values ofK. This is expected, since the gain of the optimized
multicast beamforming is higher for a smaller user group. Th e
gain reduces as the group size increases, and the difference
among algorithms reduces.
2) Single Group: We now compare our proposed algorithm
with other algorithms, including the APG method [18], in the
single group scenario. Fig. 8 shows the average minimum SINR
vs. the number of RIS elements MforG= 1,K= 4, andN=
30. We see that Algorithm 2 outperforms all other algorithms
signiﬁcantly. In particular, our proposed algorithm provi des1∼
2.5dB gain over APG for Mranging from 25∼300.
We also compare the average computation time of different
methods in Table II for the setting used in Fig. 8. IP method ha s
the highest computational complexity. Algorithm 2 and APG
have a similar computation time as Mincreases. Although
APG is slightly faster than Algorithm 2, the difference is no t
signiﬁcant.2 3 4 5 6 7 8

3) Unicast Scenario: We also consider the RIS-assisted
downlink beamforming in a unicast scenario with 4users
by settingG= 4 andK= 1 . Note that in this case,
Algorithm 2 and APG have different design objectives: APG
aims to maximize the sum rate of all users, while Algorithm 2
aims to maximize the minimum SINR among users. For com-
parison, we plot the average minimum SINR and the sum
rate performance over Min Figs. 9 and 10, respectively, for
N= 30 . We see that Algorithm 2 outperforms the APG method
and other methods for both the minimum SINR and the sum
rate objectives.
VIII. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we consider joint BS and RIS beamforming de-
sign for RIS-assisted downlink multi-user beamforming, ai ming
to provide efﬁcient and scalable algorithms. We have shown t hat
the joint BS and RIS beamforming optimization for the QoS
problem can be broken down into a BS multicast beamforming
QoS problem and an RIS passive multicast beamforming MMF
problem, and we have proposed an AMBF approach to solve
the two subproblems alternatingly. We have utilized the opt imal
multicast beamforming structure to solve the BS multicast
beamforming QoS problem efﬁciently. We have also developed
a PSA-based fast iterative algorithm to solve the challengi ng
RIS passive multicast MMF problem, which only contains
closed-form updates with cheap computation. We have shown
that our AMBF approach is also applicable to the unicast
scenario, making it an effective method for general RIS-ass isted
downlink beamforming. For the RIS-assisted MMF problem,
based on the relation of the QoS and MMF problems, we
have used the optimal BS beamforming structure again to13
