Seismically generated sound waves that propagate through the ocean are used to infer
temperature anomalies and their vertical structure in the deep East Indian Ocean. These
Twaves are generated by earthquakes off Sumatra and received by hydrophone stations off
Diego Garcia and Cape Leeuwin. Between repeating earthquakes, a Twave’s travel time
changes in response to temperature anomalies along the wave’s path. What part of the
water column the travel time is sensitive to depends on the frequency of the wave, so mea-
suring travel time changes at a few low frequencies constrains the vertical structure of the
inferred temperature anomalies. These measurements reveal anomalies due to equatorial
waves, mesoscale eddies, and decadal warming trends. By providing direct constraints on
basin-scale averages with dense sampling in time, these data complement previous point
measurements that alias local and transient temperature anomalies.
2Plain language summary
Taking up almost all of the excess heat trapped on Earth by anthropogenic greenhouse
gases, the ocean exerts a key control on our warming climate. Despite progress, tracking
that heat remains an observational challenge. This study presents new measurements of
ocean warming by making use of sound waves that are generated by earthquakes and prop-
agate long distances through the ocean. These sound waves propagate faster in warmer
seawater, so they arrive slightly earlier if warming has occurred. In this study, we measure
such changes in arrival time at different frequencies—or pitches—that are sensitive to dif-
ferent parts of the water column, so warming in the upper ocean can be distinguished from
warming in the deep ocean.
31 Introduction
The ocean is warming in response to accumulating greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
and its heat capacity dominates the climate system’s thermal inertia. While the warming
has been most pronounced in the surface ocean, heat transfer to the deep ocean importantly
slows the climate change experienced at the surface (e.g., Hansen et al., 1981; Gregory, 2000;
Held et al., 2010; Kostov et al., 2014). Roemmich et al. (2015), for example, estimated from
Argo ﬂoats that the top 0 .5 km of the global ocean warmed at a rate of 5 mKyr−1between
2006 and 2013, whereas the layer between 0 .5 and 2 km warmed at a rate of 2 mKyr−1. Had
the heat not been transferred below 0 .5 km depth, the top 0 .5 km would have warmed more
than twice as rapidly (excluding feedbacks with the atmosphere and radiative transfer).
It is thus important to constrain the heat transfer to the deep ocean. Because this trans-
fer is achieved by processes that depend on uncertain parameterizations in climate models
(the overturning circulation, mesoscale eddies, and diapycnal mixing), strong observational
constraints are crucial.
It remains an observational challenge to isolate the small-amplitude and large-scale cli-
mate signal in the presence of much larger-amplitude but local ﬂuctuations due to mesoscale
eddies, internal waves, and other oceanic transients. To 2 km depth and since the mid-2000s,
Argo ﬂoats have provided unprecedented coverage of the world ocean. Even with currently
about 4000 ﬂoats, however, the Argo array still aliases mesoscale eddies, and regional es-
timates of warming rates remain uncertain (e.g., Wunsch, 2016; Dushaw, 2019; Fig. 1a).
Additionally, and maybe more glaringly, Core Argo ﬂoats do not sample half of the ocean’s
volume: that below 2 km depth. While the Deep Argo array is expanding (e.g., Roemmich
et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2020), the extant record is short and limited to a few regions.
Estimates of temperature change below 2 km rely heavily on sparse hydrographic sections
that are sampled about once a decade (e.g., Roemmich and Wunsch, 1984; Purkey and John-
son, 2010; Desbruyères et al., 2016; Desbruyères et al., 2017; Volkov et al., 2017; Fig. 1a).
State estimates constrain such changes by combining available observations with an ocean
model (e.g., Wunsch and Heimbach, 2007), but the possibility of model error and the lack of
an uncertainty estimate make it difﬁcult to assess how reliable such estimates are. For ex-
ample, Wunsch and Heimbach (2014) inferred widespread cooling of the abyssal ocean using
the ECCO (v4r1) state estimate (relative to an assumed and corrected initial state), whereas
direct estimates from repeat hydrographic sections tend to indicate a dominance of warm-
ing (e.g., Purkey and Johnson, 2010; Desbruyères et al., 2017). Clearly, better observational
constraints are needed.
Recently, Wu et al. (2020) demonstrated that sound waves generated by earthquakes,
so-called Twaves, can be used to constrain basin-scale temperature change in the deep
ocean. These measurements are based on the idea of “ocean acoustic tomography,” which
was originally proposed by Munk and Wunsch (1979) and successfully demonstrated at both
planetary (Munk and Forbes, 1989) and basin scales (The ATOC Consortium, 1998). Twaves
propagate faster in warmer water, so changes in the average temperature encountered by
these waves can be detected as changes in their travel time. The use of sound waves pro-
duced by earthquakes eliminates the need to deploy synthetic sound sources. Wu et al. used

the seismic station DGAR on Diego Garcia to receive Twaves generated 2900 km away by
earthquakes near Nias Island off Sumatra (Fig. 1a). To remove uncertainties in the source
location and timing, repeating earthquakes were employed to extract the change in travel
time between two events. A key advantage of such acoustic measurements over point mea-
surements is that they intrinsically average the temperature change along the sound waves’
path and therefore suffer much less from spatial aliasing.
In an accompanying manuscript (hereafter referred to as W23), we show that Compre-
hensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) hydrophones are more sensitive
T-wave receivers than land stations like DGAR, which allows the detection of smaller earth-
quakes at the CTBTO station H08 off Diego Garcia than is possible with DGAR data. This
use of CTBTO data improves the time resolution of the inferred deep-ocean temperature
change between Nias Island and Diego Garcia. In W23, we further use Nias Island T-waves
received at the CTBTO station H01 off Cape Leeuwin to infer a time series of tempera-
ture change averaged along this 4400 km section extending into the extra-tropical ocean
(Fig. 1a).

averaged sensitivity kernels at different frequencies, (b), (e) the ﬁrst two singular vectors
obtained from these range-averaged sensitivity kernels, and (c), (f) the resolution matrices
of the SVD inversion employing the ﬁrst two singular vectors. All these are shown for the
path to Diego Garcia (top row) and that to Cape Leeuwin (bottom row).
Here, we make use of an additional advantage of the crisp arrivals of Twaves in CTBTO
hydrophone records: that changes in the travel time can be measured reliably at a number
of different frequencies (Fig. 1b, Section 2). Because Twaves at different frequencies are
sensitive to different parts of the water column, this frequency dependence in the travel time
change can be used to constrain the vertical structure of the temperature change (Fig. 2;
cf., Munk and Wunsch, 1983; Shang, 1989). This approach is similar to that employed in
remote sensing of the atmosphere (e.g., Fu et al., 2004), except that acoustic rather than
electromagnetic waves are used.
A similar vertical-slice tomography scheme has been developed for acoustic measure-
ments with synthetic sources (e.g., Munk and Wunsch, 1979, 1982; Munk et al., 1995), but it
has not been realized at a basin scale. The sources employed in the Acoustic Thermometry of
Ocean Climate (ATOC) experiment had frequencies centered on 75 Hz and were effectively
point sources at precisely known locations, allowing for a convenient eigenray description
6of the propagation from source to receiver. These rays have a known geometry and, under
certain circumstances, can be resolved and identiﬁed in arrival patterns (Spiesberger et al.,
1980; The Ocean Tomography Group, 1982; Cornuelle et al., 1993; The ATOC Consortium,
1998; Worcester et al., 1999). Relative changes in the arrival times of different rays can
then be used to infer the vertical structure of temperature change, most easily in the range
average. For example, the arrival time of steep rays that sample the surface mixed layer
undergo a larger seasonal cycle than near-axial rays that are conﬁned to the thermocline
and deep ocean. On the bottom-mounted receivers used in ATOC, however, only relatively
steep rays could be resolved and identiﬁed, and the information on the vertical structure of
the temperature ﬁeld was limited (Dushaw, 1999; Dushaw et al., 2009).
The propagation and arrival patterns of Twaves are more complicated (e.g., Okal, 2008),
but information on the vertical structure of the temperature change can still be extracted.
Sensitivity kernels quantify how the arrival time changes in response to a temperature
perturbation anywhere along the path and anywhere in the water column (Fig. 2; Wu et
al., 2020). Consistent with expectations from simpliﬁed modal calculations (Fig. S1), these
range-averaged sensitivity kernels shift upward in the water column for increasing frequen-
cies (Fig. 2). A surface-intensiﬁed warming, for example, produces a larger reduction in
travel time at high frequencies than at low frequencies. We use this frequency dependence
to estimate a rough vertical structure of the range-averaged deep temperature anomalies.
We ﬁnd that the inferred structure of the anomalies along the two sections matches expec-
tations based on the dynamics that produce the anomalies and is in general agreement with
previous estimates, although the T-wave data tends to show stronger anomalies and more
reliably captures perturbations due to mesoscale eddies (Section 3).
2 Inferring vertical structure
The starting point for the inference of vertical structure in the temperature anomalies are
the time series of travel time anomalies at a few different low frequencies, constructed from
a total of 11479 repeating pairs that arise from 3457 earthquakes in 2005 to 2018 (Fig. 1b;
W23). We choose 2 .00 Hz, 3 .00 Hz, and 4 .00 Hz for the path to Diego Garcia and 2 .50 Hz,
3.25 Hz, and 4 .00 Hz for the path to Cape Leeuwin. A slightly higher minimum frequency
is used for the latter path because 2 .00 Hz Twaves are less consistently received at Cape
Leeuwin than at Diego Garcia. Measurements at higher frequencies are not reliable because
the waveform correlation drops markedly beyond 4 Hz (e.g., Fig. 1b). For each frequency, we
apply a Gaussian ﬁlter with width 0 .5 Hz centered on that frequency before calculating the
correlation function between the T-wave arrivals of an event pair, as described in W23. How
these time series are obtained from measured travel time differences between repeating
events is described in Text S1, and the cycle skipping corrections that are applied to the
measurements are described in Text S2.
To turn the time series of travel time anomalies at different frequencies into an esti-
mate of the evolving vertical structure of temperature anomalies, we perform a singular
value decomposition (SVD) of the range-integrated sensitivity kernels (Fig. 2). The prob-
7lem is severely under-determined, so we can only hope to obtain a coarse estimate of the
vertical temperature structure. Let Kdenote the matrix whose three rows contain the
range-integrated sensitivity kernels at the three frequencies, discretized to a ∆z=50 m
grid. Then, at each event time t, we would like to invert τ(t)=KT(t)∆zforT(t), where τ(t)
contains the T-wave travel time anomalies at the three frequencies, and T(t) contains the
range-averaged temperature anomaly proﬁles on the same grid as the kernels. The SVD
K=UΛVTyields the singular values λ1=2.6 sK−1km−1,λ2=0.21 sK−1km−1, and λ3=
0.022 sK−1km−1for the path to Diego Garcia and λ1=4.6 sK−1km−1,λ2=0.30 sK−1km−1,
andλ3=0.012 sK−1km−1for the path to Cape Leeuwin (see Text S1 for details). The rapid
decay in the singular values is a result of the similarity of the sensitivity kernels at the
chosen frequencies, i.e., their being nearly linearly dependent. Small singular values am-
plify errors (we only know the estimate ˜τ, not the true τ), so a common trade-off must be
made between resolution and precision. We choose to retain the ﬁrst two singular vectors
to obtain coarse vertical resolution with acceptable uncertainty: ˜T2(t)=h−1V2Λ2−1U2T˜τ(t),
where U2andV2consist of the ﬁrst two columns of UandV, respectively, Λ2is the di-
agonal matrix containing λ1andλ2, and h=5 km is a ﬁxed reference depth. The esti-
mate ˜T2(t) is then related to the true temperature ﬁeld T(t) by ˜T2(t)=h−1V2V2TT(t)∆z+
h−1V2Λ2−1U2T[˜τ(t)−τ(t)]. In the absence of errors in ˜τ(t), the estimate ˜T2(t) is a projection
of the true state T(t) onto the ﬁrst two singular vectors, and the resolution matrix V2V2T
determines to what degree features can be resolved by the available data. For both paths,
only features between about 0 .5 and 3 km depth can be captured, and the depth resolution
is no better than about 1 km (Fig. 2). The projection coefﬁcients are estimated from the data
as˜c2(t)=h−1V2T˜T2(t)∆z=h−1Λ2−1U2T˜τ(t), with which the reconstructed temperature pro-
ﬁle is the linear combination ˜T2(t)=V2˜c2(t). (Note that the prior covariances for inferring
˜τ(t) from the travel time changes between repeating events are chosen such that the three
components of ˜c(t)=h−1Λ−1UT˜τ(t) are uncorrelated. Any phase relations between them
therefore arise entirely from the data. Details are given in Text S1.)
Taking this SVD approach to inversion, we feign complete ignorance about the vertical
structure of the range-averaged temperature anomalies. The inversion uses neither con-
straints from the physics that govern the temperature ﬁeld nor prior information, say from
previous measurements or model simulations. In particular, the inversion knows nothing
of the typically strong surface intensiﬁcation of temperature anomalies, which entails that
inverted temperature anomalies tend to reach too deep and that upper-ocean anomalies can
produce spurious oppositely signed deep anomalies (Fig. S6, S7). We nevertheless choose
this agnostic approach to illustrate most simply what information is contained in the T-
wave data. Future work should combine this information from seismic data with prior in-
formation and other observations.

prominent seasonal and sub-seasonal variations, as well as signiﬁcant decadal trends for

the path to Diego Garcia (Fig. 3a,b; 4a,b; Table 1). The ﬁrst singular vectors have a similar
shape as the kernels themselves, so their coefﬁcients represent a weighted average of the
deep temperature anomalies, with the weighting peaked at 1 .5 km and 1 .3 km for the paths
to Diego Garcia and Cape Leeuwin, respectively (Fig. 2b,e). The second singular vectors
have nodes at 1 .7 km and 1 .5 km for the two paths, so the projection onto them is more
sensitive to where in the water column the anomalies are located.
These projections inferred from T-wave travel time anomalies show general agreement
with previous products. We compare our estimates to monthly interpolated Argo data (Roem-
mich and Gilson, 2009) and daily ECCO state estimate data (v4r4; Forget et al., 2015; ECCO
Consortium, 2021). Using the sensitivity kernels, we infer travel time anomalies from the
temperature anomalies of these products, interpolate those onto our event times, and sub-
sequently treat them in the same way as the T-wave anomalies.
For the path to Diego Garcia, seasonal and sub-seasonal variations in both these pro-
jections tend to line up (Fig. 3a,b), indicating that the vertical structure inferred from the
T-wave data is broadly consistent with these previous estimates. There are notable excep-
tions. The anomalies inferred from the T-wave data are stronger on average, particularly in
the projection onto the ﬁrst singular vector (Fig. 3a, Table 1). The projection onto the second
singular vector (Fig. 3b) is more positive for the Argo product than for the T-wave data in
the latter part of the time series, and it is less negative for ECCO than for the T-wave data
in the early part of the time series, producing a stronger decadal trend in both previous
products than inferred from the T-wave data (Table 1).
For the path to Cape Leeuwin, the seasonal variations in both projections are similar be-
tween those inferred from T-wave data and those from previous products (Fig. 4a,b). In con-
trast to the equatorial path to Diego Garcia, the annual signal here is much stronger than
the semi-annual signal (Table 1). The T-wave data produces sizable spikes with a duration
on the order of a month, which are typically missed by previous data (Fig. 4a,b; S7; S9). As
discussed in W23, we interpret these spikes as resulting from mesoscale eddies traversing
11the path, most importantly those shed by the Leeuwin Current. The temperature anoma-
lies of these eddies are largely conﬁned to the thermocline (e.g., Fieux et al., 2005), which
is consistent with the anomalies in the two projections appearing in phase. At times, these
eddies happen to be captured by Argo ﬂoats (e.g., 2005-10 and 2010-10), but they are more
typically missed, as expected from the Argo ﬂoat coverage (Fig. 1). ECCO does not capture
mesoscale eddies because it has too low a horizontal resolution. The overall stronger vari-
ability along this path to Cape Leeuwin implies that decadal trends are more uncertain
(Table 1), although the uncertainties in the estimation from the three data sources are not
independent.
Time series of the temperature reconstruction ˜T2illustrate the information on the ver-
tical structure contained in the T-wave data. On the path to Diego Garcia, the inferred
temperature anomalies are strongest in the upper 2 km but reach substantially below this
depth (Fig. 3c). It cannot be inferred from the data whether these abyssal anomalies are real
or whether they arise from the insufﬁcient vertical resolution. (See Fig. S6, S7, S8, and S9
for projections of Argo and ECCO data onto the ﬁrst two singular vectors.) Nevertheless, the
anomalies display an upward phase propagation that is expected for long surface-generated
equatorial waves that have a downward energy ﬂux (e.g., Wunsch, 1977; Philander, 1978;
McPhaden, 1982; Luyten and Roemmich, 1982; Reppin et al., 1999). This upward phase
propagation is not apparent on the extratropical path to Cape Leeuwin (Fig. 4c), where
the inferred anomalies are more strongly conﬁned to above 2 km depth, consistent with
mesoscale thermocline eddies.
In interpreting these results, it should be kept in mind that the sensitivity kernels are
based on two-dimensional numerical simulations of the wave propagation from the source
to the receiver (Wu et al., 2020). These simulations depend, albeit not sensitively, on as-
sumptions about the thickness and properties of sediment layers and on the neglect of off-
geodesic effects. There is therefore representational uncertainty in our estimates of temper-
ature anomalies and their vertical structure arising from uncertainty in the kernels. More
work is needed to better understand these effects.
4 Conclusions
The data presented here demonstrate that changes in T-wave travel times contain infor-
mation on the vertical structure of the temperature anomalies encountered by these waves
along their paths. This information can be extracted from travel time anomalies at a few low
frequencies even though the sensitivity kernels at these frequencies have similar vertical
structures (Fig. 2).
We here illustrated this vertical structure using a simple SVD inversion. In the future,
theT-wave data should be combined with Argo and ship-based hydrographic data, either
using a relatively simple mapping as typically employed for Argo data or using state esti-
mation as in ECCO, which also allows one to incorporate additional constraints, for example
from altimetry and gravitometry. Twaves offer constraints on the large-scale temperature
changes that are complementary to previous data. They intrinsically average in space, so
12they do not miss mesoscale eddies like the Argo array. They offer a dense sampling in time,
which is important even for large-scale averages that still contain sizable anomalies in-
duced by equatorial waves and mesoscale eddies. Twaves offer constraints on the ocean
below 2 km depth, which has been sparsely sampled in space and time by ship-based hydro-
graphic surveys. The vertical resolution obtained from T-wave is relatively coarse, but they
nevertheless constrain the vertical structure of the large-scale temperature anomalies.
In the present work, we restricted ourselves to low frequencies because the waveform cor-
relation drops substantially at higher frequencies (Fig. 1b) and travel time changes cannot
be extracted conﬁdently. The T-wave signals have plenty of power at these higher frequen-
cies, so noise is unlikely to be the problem. Instead, we speculate that the higher-frequency
signals contain multiple vertical acoustic modes. The modes become more conﬁned in the
vertical as the frequency increases, so more modes escape interaction with the bottom and
subsequent attenuation. Different modes experience different time shifts, so the waveform
correlation drops if multiple modes contribute substantially. If this interpretation is correct,
much more detailed information on the vertical structure could be extracted if we were able
to separate the modes in the received signal, for example using a vertical hydrophone array
(D’Spain et al., 2001). Deploying such arrays is routine, so future T-wave measurements
could yield much stronger constraints on the vertical structure of the ocean’s large-scale
temperature variability.

1arXiv:2304.02791v1  [physics.ao-ph]  5 Apr 2023Text S1 Inversion for travel time anomalies
The procedure to infer travel time anomalies relative to an unknown but common reference
from measurements of T-wave arrival time changes and origin time corrections (relative
to a cataloged event time) is similar to that described in Wu et al. (2020), but here we
improve on that inversion in a number of ways. In particular, we invert for the T-wave delays
and origin-time corrections separately, which allows us to more naturally use multiple T-
wave and land stations as well as a set of T-wave frequencies. Instead of the somewhat
ad hoc regularization employed in Wu et al. (2020), we here impose a full set of prior and
noise statistics and use a Gauss–Markov estimator. See, for example, Wunsch (2006) for an
introduction to the methods employed here.
Our primary goal is to infer time series of the travel time anomalies at the observed
frequencies ω1,...,ωl, stacked into the vector
τ=
τ1
...
τl
. (1)
These travel time anomalies, ascribed to changes in the ocean’s temperature ﬁeld, are dif-
ferences between T-wave arrival anomalies and origin time corrections:
τ=Da with D=
Im −Im
......
Im−Im
 and a=
a(T)
1...
a(T)
l
a(L)
, (2)
where a(T)
icontains the T-wave travel time anomalies for each event time at the different
frequencies, and a(L)contains the origin time corrections inferred from the land stations.
Here, Imdenotes the identity matrix of size m, the number of unique events. All delays are
referenced to predicted arrival times based on the cataloged event times. The predictions
are made using the PREM solid earth model for the land stations and a constant T-wave
reference velocity of 1 .5 kms−1.
The travel time anomalies τare related to the range-averaged temperature anomalies
through the sensitivity kernel:
τ=(K⊗Im)T∆z, where K=
K1T
...
KlT
 and T=
T1
...
Tn
 (3)
are the matrices containing the range-integrated kernels as rows and a stack of the time
series of range-averaged temperature anomalies at the nvertical levels, respectively, and ⊗
denotes a Kronecker product. As described in the main text, we perform an SVD of the sen-
sitivity matrix K=UΛVT. We normalize such that UTU=I3andh−1VTV∆z=Il, where
2∆z=50 m is the vertical grid spacing and h=5 km is a reference depth. With this normal-
ization, the singular vectors are unitless and do not depend on the discretization (as long as
it is ﬁne enough). We denote the projections of the temperature anomalies onto the singular
vectors by c=h−1(VT⊗Im)T∆z, so that τ=h(UΛ⊗Im)c, which can be inverted for the time
series c=h−1(Λ−1UT⊗Im)τ.
We cannot, however, observe the travel time anomalies directly. We only observe changes
in the travel time between repeating earthquakes. The design matrix thus takes differences
of travel time anomalies between event pairs:
E=/parenleftbiggIl⊗X(T)0
0 X(L)/parenrightbigg
. (4)
The pair matrices X(T)andX(L)take these differences between events at all T-wave and
land stations involved. For example, if there were four pairs connecting ﬁve events observed
at one T-wave section, we might have
X(T)=
−1 1
−1 1
−1 1
−1 1
. (5)
If pairs 1, 2, and 4 are observed at land station 1, and pairs 1 and 3 are observed on land
station 2, the land station pair matrix would be
X(L)=
−1 1
−1 1
−1 1
−1 1
−1 1
. (6)
The observed arrival time offsets, again measured relative to the cataloged event times, are
then
δ=Ea+n with δ=
δ(T)
1...
δ(T)

δ(L)
(7)
containing a stack of the T-wave offsets measured at different frequencies and the land
offsets. The observational noise is denoted by n.
We specify prior statistics for the projections onto the singular vectors (i.e., for c), and
we assign these covariances to the T-wave anomalies a(T)

3where Σis a diagonal matrix that speciﬁed the prior variances in the time series of the
projections onto the singular vectors (Table S1). The diagonal nature of Σmeans that we
assign no prior correlations between the projections onto the singular vectors. The matrix C
speciﬁes the time correlation Ci j=e−|ti−tj|/λ, which we assume to be identical for all singular
vectors. The expected standard deviation of origin time corrections is speciﬁed as σ=5 s, and
1l+1denotes a square matrix of size l+1 ﬁlled with ones. This prescribes perfect correlation
between the origin time correction and the part of the T-wave anomalies that is due to origin
time errors.
In addition to the random process with exponential correlation function, we also include
deterministic annual and semi-annual cycles as well as a linear trend. We do so by append-
ing their coefﬁcients to the vector aand extending the matrices E,R, and D. For the design
matrix,

event. For the prior covariance matrix,
R→/parenleftbiggR 0

where Ξis a diagonal matrix containing the prior variances for the trend or seasonal am-
plitudes for the projections onto the singular vectors. Like for the random components, we
assign no prior correlation between the trends and seasonal amplitudes of these projections.
For the difference matrix,

such that the trends and seasonal variations are included in the travel time anomalies τ.
Once we specify the noise statistics N=σn2Iwith σn=0.01 s, we now have all informa-
tion required for a Gauss–Markov estimate:
˜a=PETN−1δ with P=/parenleftbig
R−1+ETN−1E/parenrightbig−1. (14)
The desired estimate of the travel time anomalies is then ˜τ=D˜a, and the posterior covari-
ance Pcan be propagated to this estimate as DPDT. Similarly, estimates of the projections
onto singular vectors ˜c, of the trends, and seasonal amplitudes of the signal can be obtained
from ˜a, and their uncertainties can be calculated from P.
The prescription σn=0.01 s is meant to capture errors due to the changes in the source
location between repeating events (Wu et al., 2020), due to noise affecting the cross-correlation

function, and due to hydrophone motion. The moored CTBTO hydrophones are displaced by
local currents, which contributes measurement error because the moorings are not navi-
gated. Nichols and Bradley (2017) estimated that the CTBTO hydrophones at Wake Island,
similar in design to the ones used here, can be displaced by 1/20 of the length of their moor-
ing lines. The mooring lines for H08S2 and H01W2 are 562 m and 570 m long, respectively,
producing maximum horizontal displacements of less than 30 m. A horizontal displacement
of 30 m corresponds to a travel time anomaly of 0 .02 s, which is equal to 2 σn. A more re-
ﬁned prescription of Nmight split the errors into their contributing factors and take the
respective error correlations into account. We leave this reﬁnement to future work.
Text S2 Cycle-skipping correction
Acoustic modes are dispersive. If the sounds speed proﬁle is perturbed, a dispersive mode’s
phase and group will shift by different amounts. If the differential shift between a mode’s
phase and group is large enough, the correlation function will peak not at the correct phase
shift but at the next peak over. The modal dispersion causes a cycle skip.
We here illustrate this process using a simple example of a Gaussian wave packet prop-
agating through Munk’s canonical sound speed proﬁle. The observed T-wave delays show a
tell-tale sign of this process, suggesting that the same process occurs in the real system. The
simple physics causing the cycle skipping allows for a robust identiﬁcation and correction
procedure, described below.
To illustrate the process causing cycle skipping, we consider modal propagation through
a range-independent ocean with slowness proﬁle S(z), following Munk et al. (1995). A signal
propagating a distance Lhas a phase travel time τ=Ls, where s=k/ωis the modal phase
slowness that equals the slowness S(z) at the turning depths. The modal structure Pis

Because variations in the slowness are much smaller than their mean values, the sensitivity
proﬁles are roughly P2/hfor the phase and [ P2+ω(P2)ω]/hfor the group.
These phase and group sensitivity proﬁles thus have different structures (Fig. S2). We
illustrate their behavior using the lowest mode at ω/2π=2.5 Hz for the canonical temperate
proﬁle of Munk (1974) and Munk et al. (1995; eq. 2.2.13). Above 1 .6 km depth, the group
sensitivity to sound speed perturbations is larger than the phase sensitivity. If the temper-
ature anomalies that cause these sound speed perturbations are dominated by this depth
range, as is typical, the group delay ∆τg=L∆sgwill exceed the phase delay ∆τ=L∆s. If the
group delay is more than a half period larger than the phase delay, cycle skipping is likely.
In this scenario, cycle skipping is always forward: the skip goes in the same direction as the
delay. It is important to correct this cycle skipping because otherwise large anomalies would
be overestimated systematically.
As an example, consider a slowness perturbation that is caused by a single low dynamical
mode (Fig. S2). For the buoyancy frequency proﬁle N=N0ez/dunderlying the canonical
sound speed proﬁle, the sound speed perturbation is proportional to N2G. The dynamical
mode Gfor vertical displacement is deﬁned by
d2G
dz2+N2
c2G=0 (20)
with G=0 at z=0 and z= −h, and a normalization/integraltext
dz N2G2=his applied. We use
h=5 km, but this has little impact on the results because neither the ﬁrst acoustic mode
nor the ﬁrst dynamical mode has much amplitude in the bottom 1 km or so. For the ﬁrst
dynamical, ∆τg/∆τ=1.61, so cycle skipping is likely for |∆τ| >0.33 s. This is about where we
observe cycle skipping to occur in the real Twaveforms received at Cape Leeuwin.
To further illustrate the cycle skipping, we consider a signal with the source function
e−σ2t2cosωt. We again use the frequency ω/2π=2.5 Hz, and we impose a bandwidth σ/2π=
0.5 Hz corresponding to the ﬁltering we use for the real data. We then propagate this signal

assuming a dispersion relation linearized around ω. We impose phase lags ∆τ=0.0 s,0.3 s,
and 0 .6 s and group lags ∆τg=1.61∆τ, corresponding to propagation through an anomaly
caused by the ﬁrst dynamical mode (Fig. S3). Correlating the delayed signals with the signal
without lag, the signal with ∆τ=0.3 s produces a maximum of the correlation function at the
correct phase lag. But the signal with ∆τ=0.6 s experiences cycle skipping: the maximum
of the correlation function shifts by one period to a lag of 1 .0 s. The secondary maximum to
the left is at the correct lag. If cycle skipping can be identiﬁed, it can easily be corrected by
picking the adjacent peak in the correlation function.
This type of cycle skipping caused by dispersive modal propagation can be identiﬁed in
the real data. If the ﬁrst acoustic mode dominates and temperature anomalies are surface-
intensiﬁed, the cycle skipping causes an increase in the magnitude of the low-frequency (say,
2.5 Hz) phase delay. At the same time, it causes a decrease in the differential delay between
a higher frequency (say, 4 Hz) and this low frequency. Plotting the measured low-frequency
and differential delays against one another reveals three distinct clusters: a center cluster
with small low-frequency delays that is not affected by cycle skipping and adjacent clus-
ters with larger-magnitude low-frequency delays that suffer from forward or backward cycle
skipping (Fig. S4, S5).

We identify pairs in these clusters by employing a Gaussian mixture model with three
components that have shared covariances. We correct pairs in the left cluster by shifting
to the next maximum of the correlation function to the right of the original maximum, and
we correct pairs in the right cluster by shifting to the next maximum to the left. We then
probe for additional cycle skips (or reversals of corrections applied after the cluster analysis)
by looking for reductions in the cost of the inversion for travel time anomalies (cf. Wu et
al., 2020). We allow such additional corrections if the Gaussian mixture model indicates a
probability greater than 0.1 % to belong to a cluster different from that identiﬁed as most
likely. For the path to Diego Garcia, this procedure corrects 40 pairs to the left and 56 pairs
to the right (out of a total of 3831 used pairs). For the path to Cape Leeuwin, cycle skipping
is more common, both because the path is longer and because travel time anomalies are
somewhat larger. Here, 230 pairs are corrected to the left, and 393 pairs are corrected to the
right (out of a total of 3032 used pairs).

low-frequency delay (s)after additional corrections (b)Figure S4: Cycle-skipping corrections for the path to Diego Garcia. Shown are the low-
frequency delays (2 .0 Hz) vs. the differential delays (4 .0 Hz minus 2 .0 Hz). The green dots
indicate identiﬁed cycle skipping that is corrected to the right, the blue dots indicate cycle
skipping corrected to the left, and orange dots indicate pairs not identiﬁed as being affected
by cycle skipping. The identiﬁcations are (a) after the cluster analysis and (b) after addition
corrections (or reversals) based on the inversion cost.
