We report continuous loading of87Rb atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) at narrow linewidth,
420 nm 5S 1/2, F= 2 →6P3/2, F= 3 blue transition (blue MOT). Continuous loading of the blue
MOT is achieved by superimposing the blue laser beam, inside a hollow core of infrared laser beam
driving the broad 5S 1/2, F= 2 →5P3/2, F= 3 transition at 780 nm. We typically load ∼108atoms
in the blue MOT in 2.5 seconds. We characterize the continuous loading of blue MOT with various
parameters such as magnetic field gradient, detuning, power and diameter of blue MOT beam and
diameter of the hollow core (spot) inside the IR MOT beam. We observe that the blue laser beam
should overfill the spot of the IR laser beam. This is because the blue laser cools the atoms to
a lower temperature even in the presence of the broad IR laser i.e. in the overlapped region and
hence helps in loading. We also present the theoretical framework for cooling atoms in the presence
of simultaneously two transitions to support the experimental result. This method of continuous
loading of the blue MOT can be useful to produce a continuous atomic beam of cold Rb atoms.
I. INTRODUCTION
Magneto-optical trapping (MOT) is the workhorse for
all cold atom experiments and is the basis of modern ar-
eas of research in quantum science and technology such
as quantum computation and simulation, and quantum
sensors. For MOT, the linewidth of transition plays an
important role. MOT at broader linewidth compared to
narrow linewidth transition provides faster loading with
higher capture velocity but the final temperature hap-
pens to be higher. In order to achieve more number of
atoms in MOT with low temperature, two steps MOT
is utilized [1–10]. In the first step, atoms are loaded
in MOT at a broad linewidth transition and in the sec-
ond step, atoms are transferred to the MOT at a narrow
linewidth transition to achieve lower temperature, which
means these two steps are separated in time. Instead of
separating these two steps in time, one can also separate
in space which results in the continuous loading of atoms
in MOT and was the key process for producing continu-
ous BEC of Sr [11]. Continuous loading of the atoms in
MOT at narrow transition can enable us to generate a
continuous beam of the cold atoms at lower temperatures
which offers a great advantage for atomic-based quantum
sensors as it eliminates dead time.
The two steps MOT has been realized in Yb [1, 2], Sr
[3, 11], Dy [4, 5, 12, 13], Er [14–16] and Cd [17] (where
the ratio of the linewidth of broad to narrow transition
is in orders of magnitude) and also in alkali elements [6–
9, 18] (where the ratio is 4 −5 times). The continuous
loading of the MOT at narrow transition pre-cooled by
broad transition has been realized for certain elements
Yb [1], Sr [11] and Dy [5]. In the case of Yb, continuous
loading of MOT at narrow transition is superior in terms
of the number of atoms and of course temperature [1, 19,
20]. Yb MOT at broader transition has less number of
∗kanhaiyapandey@iitg.ac.inatoms (even in the presence of repumper lasers [21]) as
compared to the narrow transition. The MOT for alkali
atoms at narrow transitions in Li [6], K [7], Rb [9, 18]
has been realized but continuous loading has not been
reported yet. We use core-shell MOT similar to the Yb
[19] where a huge advantage was reported. In the scheme,
a hole is created in the core of the laser beam driving the
broad transition which is filled by the laser beam at a
narrow transition. The relative dimension of the core
and the filling beam is very important and depends upon
the ratio of broad and narrow linewidth transition. In
the case of Yb, the ratio of the linewidth of broad to
narrow transition is around 150 and the core should be
just filled as in the presence of the broad linewidth laser
the weak transition laser (with intensity comparable to
the saturation intensity) does not play a significant role
in reducing the temperature. The case can be different
in alkali atoms where the linewidths of the broad and
narrow transitions are only 4-5 times. In this case, the
filling area should be bigger than the core area as in the
overlapped region, the narrow transition linewidth plays
a role in reducing the temperature even in the presence
of the broad transition.
In this paper, we present a method to load atoms con-
tinuously in the narrow-line MOT by superimposing the
narrow-line beam inside the core of the broad transition
beam. Using Rubidium atoms, we demonstrate the load-
ing of 1 .2×108atoms continuously in the blue MOT at
420 nm using 5S 1/2, F= 2 →6P3/2, F= 3 transition. We
study the behaviour of the blue MOT with various pa-
rameters such as magnetic field gradient, detuning, power
and diameter of blue MOT beam and diameter of the spot
inside the IR MOT beam.
The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we
describe the experimental set-up. In section III, we de-
scribe the theoretical model for the calculation of force,
diffusion and temperature in the presence of the two tran-
sitions at 780 nm and 420 nm. In section IV, we study the
various effects due to magnetic-field gradient, detuning,
power and diameter of the blue MOT laser and diame-arXiv:2401.08286v1  [physics.atom-ph]  16 Jan 20242
ter of the spot on the IR MOT laser. In section V, we
summarize our findings.
II. EXPERIMENTAL SET- UP
The relevant energy level diagram and corresponding
transitions utilized in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The
laser system comprises one commercially (Toptica) avail-
able 420 nm (blue) external cavity diode laser (ECDL)
and two home-assembled 780 nm (IR) ECDLs. The blue
laser is divided into two parts: one for its frequency stabi-
lization using saturation absorption spectroscopy (SAS)
and the second for trapping the atoms in the blue MOT.
Fig. 2 depicts the schematics of the SAS setup. The
probe beam is passed through one Rb vapor cell and de-
tected on a high-speed and blue color-sensitive photo-
detector (make: Thorlabs, model: APD430A2/M). The
vapor cell is kept inside an oven at 85 °C. The other part
of blue laser beam is sent through an AOM in double-
pass configuration. It is up-shifted by around +2 ×46.75
MHz and is sent through the cell as a control beam with
counter-propagating to the probe beam. This central fre-
quency is adjusted to vary the detuning (∆ B) of the blue
MOT beam. The AOM frequency is modulated at 10
kHz to generate the error signal. Note that the probe
beam is not modulated and thus gives a better signal-
to-noise ratio than when it is modulated. The laser is
locked corresponding to the 5S 1/2, F= 2 →6P3/2, F= 3
peak. A portion of the leak beam is used for monitoring
the single-mode operation and the wavelength of the 420
nm laser using a wavelength meter (make: Highfinesse
GmbH, model: WS7-60).
The second part of the blue beam is passed through
another AOM at +49 .75 MHz, and its first-order beam
is sent to the mixing scheme as shown in Fig. 3(a) after
expanding it by ten times. This AOM is used for switch-
ing the blue beam on and off and varying its power. An
iris is used for changing the diameter of the blue beam
(ϕB).
Polarization spectroscopy is employed for the two IR
laser’s frequency stabilization, as described in [9]. The IR
MOT laser is locked to 5S 1/2, F= 2 →5P3/2, F= (2 ,3)
cross-over peak and IR repumper laser is locked to 5S 1/2,
F= 1→5P3/2, F= 1 peak. Other parts of the IR MOT
and repumper lasers are sent through two different AOMs
at +123 .5 MHz and +150 MHz, respectively to address
the 5S 1/2, F= 2 →5P3/2, F= 3 and 5S 1/2, F= 1 →
5P3/2, F= 2 transitions. The first-order diffracted beams
are then expanded ten times individually and sent to the
mixing scheme, as shown in Fig. 3(a).
On the path of the IR MOT beam, a circular mask
(MA) is introduced so that a hollow core of diameter
ϕspotcan be created inside the IR MOT beam. IR beams
are then mixed on a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) and
made the same polarized using another PBS and a half-
plate. The vertical polarized beam from the PBS is
mixed with the vertical polarized blue MOT beam using

the same polarization are generated from the horizon-
tally polarized beams from the PBS using two half wave-
plates, two PBS, and two dichroic mirrors (not shown in

mum diameter is limited to 16 mm due to the limitation
set by the maximum diameter of the half wave-plates
used in this experiment.
Three arms are then made circularly polarized using

same as in [9]. Atomic Rb vapors are introduced into the
chamber by passing 2.15 A electric current to a dispenser
(AlfaSource AS-Rb-0090-2C) inside the glass chamber.
The absorption imaging technique is used to capture
the image of the atomic cloud on a CMOS camera (Thor-
labs, CS135MUN) using an imaging beam. The imaging
beam is 5 MHz red detuned from the 5S 1/2, F= 2 →
5P3/2, F= 3 transition. It is generated using double-pass
AOM and is coupled to a single-mode fiber. The camera’s
exposure time is 100 µs, and the imaging beam is turned
on for 52 µs during the imaging cycle. The temperature
of the cloud is determined from the time of flight method.
III. THEORY
In order to analyse the cooling mechanism in the pres-
ence of both transitions, we use the density matrix ap-
proach in one dimension. We consider that two (counter-
propagating) laser beams are driving the transition |1⟩
(5S1/2, F=2) → |2⟩(5P3/2, F=3) at 780 nm and two
(counter-propagating) laser beams are driving the tran-
sition |1⟩(5S1/2, F=2) → |3⟩(6P3/2, F=3) at 420 nm.
The Hamiltonian ( H) for the three level system can be

Solving the density matrix equation for the above Hin-
volves a complicated procedure [22, 23]. However, wecan approximate it as two separate V-systems, one for
laser beams 780 nm and 420 nm propagating in the pos-
itive direction with detuning δ+

13and second for
laser beams 780 nm and 420 nm propagating in the neg-
ative direction with detuning δ−

k13= 2π/420 nm and δ12andδ13are detuning of the
780 nm and 420 nm lasers for stationary atoms. The ab-
sorption of the lasers is determined by the density matrix
elements which are solved by Lindblad equation [22]. The
absorption of 780 nm laser beam propagating in positive
and negative directions are given by Im( ρ+
12) and Im( ρ−
12)
respectively, similarly for the blue beams it is given by
Im(ρ+
13) and Im( ρ−
13). The damping force on the atoms
in the presence of the two lasers can be given as

The normalized force, Fdamp/(ℏk12Γ12) vs normalized
velocity, k12v/Γ12is plotted in Fig. 4(a). The param-
eters used for this plot are δ12/Γ12=δ13/Γ13=−1/2
andI/Is= 1/2 for both the lasers. Here, Γ 12(13) is the
linewidth of the 780 (420) nm transition and Isis the sat-
uration intensity. The red (blue) dash line corresponds
to the force in presence of only 780 (420) nm laser. The
black solid line represents the net force in presence of
both the lasers. For very low velocity the, Fdamp =−βv,
where βis known as damping coefficient. From Fig. 4(a),
it is clear that β420> β 780andβ420≈βboth, where
β780(420) is the βin presence of only 780 (420) nm laser
andβbothis the βin presence of both the lasers. This
implies that once the atoms are cooled by the IR laser in
the outer region and enters into the overlapped region of
the IR and blue laser, then the atoms are further cooled
down dominantly by the blue laser.

The normalized diffusion coefficient, D/(ℏk12)2Γ12vs
normalized velocity, k12v/Γ12is shown in Fig. 4(b) for
the same parameters as in Fig. 4(a). Then the effec-
tive temperature is found using the Einstein relation,
T=D(0)/βkB, where D(0) is the diffusion coeffcient
at zero velocity and kBis Boltzmann constant[24]. The
temperature vs intensity of the 420 nm laser ( I420) is
plotted in Fig. 5 for various intensity of 780 nm laser
(I780). In absence of the 780 nm laser (dark blue line),
Tdecreases linearly with decrease in I420and reaches
the Doppler temperature ( TD) corresponding to the blue
transition, given by ℏΓ13/2kB= 34 µK.
Note that TDat 780 nm is ∼150µK. As the intensity
of the IR laser increases, the Talso increases. However,4

magnitude of the wave vector of the 780 nm laser and Γ 12is
the linewidth of the IR transition. Parameters used: δ/Γ =
−1/2 and I/Is= 1/10 for both the lasers.
Tdecreases in presence of the 420 nm laser, as shown by
the light blue curve in Fig. 5. For fixed IR laser inten-
sity ( I780/Is
780<2),Tinitially decreases with increase in
I420, reaches a minimum and then increases with further
increase in I 420. This effect is more prominent for low val-
ues of I780/Is
780. This is because at low intensity, the net
drag coeffcient in presence of both the lasers is dominated
by the β420, but net diffusion coefficient is dominated by
D780. At high intensity of the 780 nm laser, cooling by
420 nm laser is ineffective as shown by the red curve.
Note that for low intensities (in the comparison to sat-
uration intensities) of 780 nm and 420 nm lasers beams,
the V-systems behaves as two separate two levels systems
(|1⟩ → | 2⟩and|1⟩ → | 3⟩). The Tfor very less intensity

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Initially, the diameter of all the beams is kept at a
maximum, i.e. 16 mm. The diameter of the spot in-
troduced in the core of the IR MOT beam is, ϕspot=
6 mm and super imposed with the blue beam. The total
power of the IR MOT, repumper, and blue MOT beam
are 50 mW, 13 mW, and 25 mW, respectively. Detun-
ing of the respective lasers are −10 MHz, −7 MHz, and
−7 MHz, respectively. A magnetic field gradient ( B′) of
12.6 G/cm is produced using an anti-helmholtz coil. We
observe that the no. of atoms in the blue MOT ( N) sat-
urates to 1 .2×108, and its loading time is 2 .5 s. It is the
same as the loading time of the IR MOT without spot.
We study the effect of detuning of the blue laser (∆ B)
on the no. of atoms ( N) at three different magnetic field
gradient. The blue laser’s power ( PB) is 25 mW. As
shown in Fig. 6(a), Nincreases slightly to 1 .2×108at
12.6 G/cm when ∆ Bis changed from −10 MHz to −7
MHz. When ∆ Bis further varied towards resonance, N
decreases, and the MOT disappears. When the mag-
netic field gradient is increased (decreased) to 18 G/cm
(9 G/cm), Ndecreases (increases).
Next, we vary the power of the blue laser ( PB) at
∆B=−7 MHz and study its effect on Nat three differ-
ent magnetic field gradients, as shown in Fig. 6(b). At
18 G/cm (green circle), with increase in PBfrom 2.5 mW
to 10 mW, Nincreases to 6 ×107and saturates with fur-
ther increase in PB. Similar trends are observed for 12 .6
G/cm (blue circle) and 9 G/cm (orange circle). However,
PBforNto reach saturation increases with increase in
magnetic field gradients.
We then switch off the IR MOT beam and optimize
the blue MOT to decrease its temperature by lowering its
power to 5 mW and changing its detuning to −3 MHz.
After a hold time of 20 ms, the blue MOT beam and the
magnetic field are switched off. We measure the temper-
ature of the blue MOT to be around ∼90µK.

FIG. 7. (Color online) No. of atoms ( N) in the blue MOT vs
diameter of the (a) blue beam ( ϕB) and (b) spot ( ϕspot). In
(a):ϕspot= 6 mm and in (b) ϕB= 16 mm.
(ϕB), we measure the no. of atoms in the blue MOT ( N)
at different ϕB. Fig. 7(a) shows the NvsϕBdata for
the 6 mm diameter of the spot ( ϕspot). We observe that,
with increase in ϕspotfrom 4 mm to 8 mm, Nincreases
from 4 .5×107to 1.1×108. With further increase in ϕspot,
there is no significant improvement in N. A similar trend
is observed for the spot size of 3 mm. We observe that for
better loading of the continuous blue MOT, the diameter
of the blue beam should be bigger than the diameter of
the spot.
Next, we study the no. of atoms in the blue MOT
(N) for three different diameters of the spot. Fig. 7(b)
shows the variation of Nvsϕspotdata for the 16 mm
diameter of the blue beam ( ϕB). When ϕspotis 3 mm
and 6 mm, we observe similar no. of atoms in the blue
MOT (i.e. N= 1.2×108). With further increase in
ϕspotto 9 mm, Nsignificantly drops to N= 8×107.
Although Ncorresponding to ϕspot= 3 mm and 6 mm
are approximately the same, the lifetime of the blue MOT
with ϕspot= 3 mm is around three times lower than the
lifetime with ϕspot= 6 mm.
We further study the effect of the diameter of the blue
beam ( ϕB) on the lifetime ( τ) of the blue MOT. First,
we measure the no. of atoms in the blue MOT ( N) at
different hold times ( tH) of the blue MOT and fit the N

Fig. 8(a) shows the variation of NwithtHat different ϕB
for the blue MOT with spot size 6 mm. Fig. 8(b) shows
the corresponding lifetime ( τ) with ϕB. We observe that
when ϕBis 4 mm, the lifetime of the blue MOT is around
180 ms. It increases to 550 ms when ϕBis increased to 8
mm and then remains the same even after increasing the
ϕBto 16 mm.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have demonstrated the continuous
loading of87Rb atoms in the blue MOT with a typi-
cal number of 1 .2×108atoms in 2.5 s. The continuous
loading of the blue MOT is achieved by superimposing
the blue laser beam inside the hollow core (spot) of the
IR laser beam driving the broad transition. In order to
achieve maximum loading, the spot size should be 6 mm
for the total diameter of 16 mm for the IR laser beam
and the size of the blue laser beam should be more than
12 mm. This means that the blue laser beam should over-
fill the spot of the IR laser beam. We have also measured
the lifetime of the blue MOT with various diameters of
the blue laser beam and found around 500 ms for a beam
diameter of more than 8 mm. This method of continu-
ous loading of the blue MOT can be useful to produce
continuous atomic beams of cold Rb atoms.
