NICHOLAS AIDOO
ABSTRACT: For any given sum of squares domain in Cn,we reduce the complexity in Catlin’s
multitype techniques by giving a complete normalization of the geometry. Using this normaliza-
tion result, we present a more elementary proof of the equali ty of the Catlin multitype and the
commutator multitype for such domains when both invariants are ﬁnite. Finally, we reformulate
algebraically Catlin’s machinery for the commutator multi type computation at the origin for any
given sum of squares domain in Cn.
1.Introduction
The multitype introduced by Catlin in [Cat84a] is one of the s igniﬁcant CR-invariants studied
in most problems related to the boundary geometry of pseudoc onvex domains and its applications.
The deﬁnition of the multitype gives no hint how to compute it and so Catlin addresses this
issue in [Cat84a] by introducing another CR-invariant know n as the commutator multitype, which
is computed by diﬀerentiating the Levi form along certain lis ts of vector ﬁelds generated from
a geometric object known as a boundary system . He further established that the two boundary
invariants are equal for any given pseudoconvex domain. The multitype is also related to the
boundary invariant, which was initially studied by Kohn in [ Koh72] for hypersurfaces in C2and
later by Bloom and Graham [BG77] for hypersurfaces in Cn.
The goal of this paper is to give a simple and elementary proof of the equality of the Catlin
multitype and the commutator multitype at a boundary point o f any sum of squares domain in Cn
given that both boundary invariants are ﬁnite. Our ﬁrst main theorem is thus formulated below.
Theorem 1.1. Let0∈Mbe a smooth real hypersurface in Cnwith deﬁning function
r= Rez1+N/summationdisplay
j=1|fj(z2,...,zn)|2,
wheref1,...,fNare holomorphic functions near 0.Suppose that Bn(0)is a boundary system deﬁned
near the origin. Denote by C(0)andM(0),the commutator multitype and the multitype at the origin
respectively and suppose that they are both ﬁnite.
Then
C(0) =M(0).
Even with the introduction of the commutator multitype, the multitype is still quite diﬃcult to
compute. Since the multitype has many interesting properti es, we seek to obtain new ideas and
methods that can reduce the complexities in its computation and also give a simpler geometric or
algebraic characterization. For instance, obtaining an in -depth geometric or algebraic insight into

[Cat84a] is relevant to the study of global regularity and su belliptic estimates of the ¯∂-Neumann
problem on pseudoconvex domains established in [Cat84b, Ca t87]. Some works that can be di-
rectly or indirectly related to the problem of ﬁnding new tec hniques to reduce the diﬃculty in the
computation of the multitype are given below.
McNeal [McN92] proved the equality of the order of contact of the boundary with complex
analytic varieties (the D’Angelo type, see [D’A82]) and the order of contact with complex lines, for
convex domains of ﬁnite type in Cn.Boaz and Straube [BS92] gave a direct geometric proof of the
same equality for convex domains as proved by McNeal and exte nded their results to a wider class
of domains. Yu [Yu92] studied the multitype for convex domai ns and obtained a simple geometric
characterization of the multitype for convex domains in ter ms of the orders of contact of complex
lines with the boundary of the domain. Kol´ aˇ r [Kol10] intro duced a constructive algorithm for the
computation of the multitype when all its entries are ﬁnite u sing weighted homogeneous polynomial
transformations. Zaitsev in [Zai19] introduced new invari ant ideal sheaves containing functions
arising in Catlin’s boundary systems and gave a more direct c omputation of the kernels of some
newlyintroducedinvarianttensorsthatsimplifytheitera tiveconstructionofsuchboundarysystems.
Basyrov, Nicoara, and Zaitsev [BNZ18] presented a techniqu e that further reduced the complexity
of the multitype computation by establishing that the polyn omial model of every pseudoconvex
domain of ﬁnite Catlin multitype contains a simple sum of squ ares of monomials, the so-called
balanced sum of squares . Recently, the author in [Aid22] applied the Kol´ aˇ r algori thm for the
multitype computation introduced in [Kol10] to a class of ma nifolds deﬁned by sums of squares
of holomorphic functions, also referred to as special domains by Kohn in [Koh72] and proved two
results. Theﬁrstresultprovedthatthemodelofasumofsqua resdomainislikewiseasumofsquares
and the second result established that the multitype is an in variant of the ideal of holomorphic
functions deﬁning the domain. Also, in the same paper, the au thor gave an algebraic reformulation
of the Kol´ aˇ r algorithm for the multitype computation and f urther gave a method that explicitly
constructed the weighted homogeneous polynomial transfor mations needed in the Kol´ aˇ r algorithm.
An interesting discovery in [BNZ18] is the obstruction to ob taining a complete normalization of
any Catlin boundary system for a general pseudoconvex domai n via any holomorphic change of
coordinates. This failure to obtain a complete normalizati on is attributed to the occurrences of
the so-called torsionin the boundary. Obviously, any strongly pseudoconvex doma in will have no
torsion in the boundary since there always exists a maximal L evi-nondegenerate subbundle that
gives a nonsingular Levi matrix at the origin. Thus, a comple te normalization of the associated
boundary system can always be achieved for such domains. It i s therefore of crucial interest to
ﬁnd out the classes of pseudoconvex domains for which there e xist a complete normalization of the
Catlin boundary systems. In this paper, we ask the following natural questions for any given sum
of squares domain in Cn:
(i). Can torsion occur in the boundary?
(ii). Can the associated Catlin boundary system of such a dom ain be completely normalized?
We will show that anegative answer tothe ﬁrstquestion answe rs thelast question inthe aﬃrmative,
which brings us to our second main theorem:

where the partial derivatives are counted with weight −λ−1

Results from Theorem 1.2 will be crucial in our proof of Theor em 1.1. This work also constitute
a part of a broader research motivated by a question posed by J . P. D’Angelo, namely how does
the stratiﬁcation of the boundary of any sum of squares domai n by the multitype level sets look
like? As a contribution towards this research program, the a uthor in [Aid22] relies on the Kol´ aˇ r
algorithm for the multitype computation in [Kol10] to give a n ideal reformulation of the multitype
computation when all its entries are ﬁnite. Hence, another m otivation in this paper is to obtain an
ideal reformulation of Catlin’s machinery for the commutat or multitype computation. This transi-
tion allows one to compute the commutator multitype from the corresponding ideal of holomorphic
functions deﬁning the domain. The reformulation also has th e advantage of reducing signiﬁcantly
the level of diﬃculty in computing the commutator multitype of any sum of squares domain in Cn.
Thepaperisorganized asfollows: Section 2providesprelim inarynotionsanddeﬁnitionspertinent
to the discussion in the subsequent sections. In section 3, a resultwhich proves that the commutator
multitype is crossterm invariant is given. This is an import ant result needed for restating Catlin’s
machinery in terms of the ideals of holomorphic functions. S ection 4 introduces the notion of
derivatives of the ideal of holomorphic functions for a sum o f squares domain under the assumption
that its corresponding commutator multitype can be compute d. Section 5 presents an important
lemma that establishes the absence of torsion in the boundar y of any sum of squares domain. The
proofs of the main theorems are given at the end of this sectio n. In Section 6, an ideal restatement
of Catlin’s machinery for the commutator multitype computa tion is presented.
2.Definitions and Notation
We give some basic deﬁnitions related to the multitype intro duced by Catlin in [Cat84a]. We
shall also present some other related deﬁnitions as given in [Aid22].
Deﬁnition 2.1. LetD⊂Cnbe a smooth bounded domain with boundary-deﬁning function r(z)
deﬁned by
(2.1) r(z) = 2Re(z1)+N/summationdisplay
j=1|fj(z2,...,zn)|2,4 NICHOLAS AIDOO
wherefj(z2,...,zn) for allj,1≤j≤Nare holomorphic functions vanishing at the origin in Cn.
The domain D⊂Cnis called a sum of squares domain . It is also referred as a special domain (see
[Koh72]).
Denote byM⊂Cnthe hypersurface deﬁned by {z∈Cn|r(z) = 0}.
Deﬁnition 2.2. Themodel hypersurface associated to Mat the origin is deﬁned as
(2.2) M0={z∈Cn:p(z,¯z) = 0},
the zero locus of the homogeneous polynomial p(z,¯z) consisting of all monomials from the Taylor
expansion of the deﬁning function that have weight 1 with res pect to the multitype weight. We call
p(z,¯z) themodel polynomial .
Deﬁnition 2.3. A weight Λ = ( λ1,...,λ n) is an n-tuple of rational numbers with 1 ≤λj≤+∞
satisfying:
i.λj≤λj+1for 1≤j≤n−1;
ii. For each t, eitherλt= +∞or there exists a sequence of nonnegative integers a1,...,at
satisfyingaj>0 for all 1 ≤j≤tand
t/summationdisplay
j=1aj
λj= 1.
We shall denote by Γ nthe set of all weights Λ as deﬁned above. We deﬁne a lexicograp hic
ordering on Γ n,i.e. for any given Λ 1,Λ2∈Γnsuch that Λ 1= (λ1,...,λ n) and Λ 2= (λ′
1,...,λ′
n),
then Λ 1>Λ2if for some t,λj=λ′

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let Ω∈Cnbe a smooth domain with deﬁning function rand letz0be a point
on the boundary bΩ.We say that the weight Λ = ( λ1,...,λ n) isdistinguished atz0if there exists
holomorphic coordinates ( z1,...,zn) aboutz0such that
i.z0is mapped to the origin;
ii. If/summationtextn

Remark 2.5. The property (ii) of Deﬁnition 2.4 can be interpreted as follo ws: there exist holo-
morphic coordinates about z0such that the boundary-deﬁning function rin the new coordinates is
of the form
(2.3) r= Rez1+p(z2,...,zn,¯z2,...,¯zn)+oΛ(1),
wherep(z2,...,zn,¯z2,...,¯zn)is aΛ-homogeneous polynomial of weighted degree 1 without pluri har-
monic terms and oΛ(1)denotes a smooth function whose derivatives of weighted ord er less than or
equal to 1 vanish at zero.
We shall denote the set of all distinguished weights at z0by˜Γ(z0).
Deﬁnition 2.6. Themultitype M(z0) atz0is deﬁned to be the smallest weight in lexicographic
senseM(z0) = (m1,...,m n) such that M(z0)≥Λ for every distinguished weight Λ ∈˜Γ(z0).
We call the multitype M(z0) atz0ﬁnite, if the last entry mn<+∞. We also recall that each mi
of the multitype satisﬁes the inequality
mn−q+1≤∆q(M,z0),
where ∆ q(M,z0) is the D’Angelo q-type as deﬁned in [D’A82, D’A93]. Thus, th e last entry mnis
bounded above by the D’Angelo 1-type ∆ 1(M,z0).CATLIN’S BOUNDARY SYSTEMS FOR SUMS OF SQUARES DOMAINS 5

vanishing order of the boundary-deﬁning function r,it is easy to see that the order of vanishing of

i.e.m1= 1.We are most interested in the vanishing order of rin the direction of the complex
tangential variables z2,...,zn.For the rest of the paper, unless stated otherwise, for any gi ven sum

Now, consider the following deﬁnitions as given in [Aid22].
Deﬁnition 2.7. Letf∈C[z2,...,zn],be a polynomial in the variables z2,...,znwith coeﬃcients

where each∂f
∂zjis a vector. J/angbracketleftf/angbracketrightis a module over the polynomial ring C[z1,...,zn].
We associate the complex Jacobian matrix J( f) given by

3.Crossterm Invariance of Catlin’s Commutator Multitype
We refer the reader to [Cat84a] and [BNZ18] for a thorough and detailed description of Catlin’s
machinery for the computation of the commutator multitype a nd the associated boundary systems.
The commutator multitype, as deﬁned in [Cat84a], is a list of npositive rational numbers, which
are obtained via the commutator properties of a system of tan gential holomorphic vector ﬁelds. We
shall denote the commutator multitype by C(z) and let C(z) = (c1,...,cn).
We seek to reformulate Catlin’s machinery for the commutato r multitype computation for a
sum of squares domain in terms of the corresponding ideals of holomorphic functions deﬁning the
domain. This restatement in terms of ideals of holomorphic f unctions, however, can only hold if the
commutator multitype at the origin is crossterm invariant. By crossterm invariance we mean that
the value of the commutator multitype is unaltered with the i nclusion or omission of crossterms
from the expansion of the moduli squares of all generators of such domains. More particularly,
we will show that each entry of the commutator multitype can a lways be realized by the modulus
squareof some monomial from the Taylor expansion of some gen erator of the sum of squares domain
inCn.For the purposes of the material discussed in this section, w e shall recall some deﬁnitions
and notation from [Cat84a].6 NICHOLAS AIDOO
Let Ω be a smoothly bounded domain and let z0be a given point in the boundary bΩ ={r= 0}.

list of vector ﬁelds, L={L1,...,Ll}such that there exists a nonvanishing vector ﬁeld Lν∈T1,0

Denote by L∂rthe function
(3.1) L∂r(z) =L1···Ll−2∂r([Ll−1,Ll])(z)
forz∈bΩ.We know from Catlin’s construction [Cat84a] that for every ﬁ nite entry of the commuta-
tor multitype C(z0) atz0∈bΩ,there exists at least one ν-admissible ordered list L={L1,...,Ll}
of minimal length l≥3 such that L∂r(z0)/ne}ationslash= 0 and also satisﬁes the equation

Here,lkis the number of times that both Lkand¯Lkappear in the list Landc(L) denotes the
solution (3.2). The chosen list Lsatisfying the above properties is denoted by Lν.Since Lνis
ν-admissible, the solution c(L) exists and c(L)∈Q+.Finally, we deﬁne the ν-th commutator
multitype entry as
(3.3) cν= inf{c(L)|Lisν-admissible, ordered and satisﬁes L∂r(z0)/ne}ationslash= 0}.
Now, we let z0= 0.From (3.3), we see that every ﬁnite entry of the commutator mu ltitype is the
inﬁmum of the set of numbers c(L),where Lisν-admissible, ordered, and satisﬁes L∂r(0)/ne}ationslash= 0.
Thus, our goal here is to show that every number c(L1) associated to some crossterm is bounded
from below by some number c(L2) associated to a square, where L1andL2are lists of vector ﬁelds
each satisfying the condition given in (3.2) and (3.3). Now, if the condition L∂r(0)/ne}ationslash= 0 holds, then
itmust holdforat least onemonomial of theboundarydeﬁning functionrandhence L∂(m)(0)/ne}ationslash= 0,
for some monomial minr.Denote by X( m) the number c(L) associated to msuch that Lsatisﬁes

Remark 3.4. It is easy to see that X(f¯g) = X(¯fg).Also, as a consequence of Lemma 3.3, the
omission of all the crossterms from the expansion of the modu li squares of the generators does not
alter the value of the commutator multitype.
Lemma 3.3 enables us to compute the commutator multitype of a sum of squares domain from
its associated ideal of holomorphic functions. As a result o f this transition, we will give an ideal
restatement of Catlin’s machinery for the commutator multi type computation in section 6.

Jacobian matrix and its conjugate transpose respectively. We know that the commutator multitype
at 0 is obtained via diﬀerentiation of the Levi form of M at 0 alo ng certain selected directions. To

Using the complex Jacobian matrix associated to the ideal of holomorphic functions /an}b∇acketle{tf/an}b∇acket∇i}ht,we will
deﬁne the derivative of /an}b∇acketle{tf/an}b∇acket∇i}htalong directions belonging to some ordered list of holomorp hic vector
ﬁelds inT1,0M.Recall that we are interested in the derivatives of the Levi f orm along certain vector
ﬁelds. Now, let L∈T1,0M.In Catlin’s notation [Cat84a], the Levi form of M at a point 0 a long
the direction Lis given by ∂¯∂r([L,¯L])(0).For any given sum of squares domain,
(4.2) ∂¯∂r([L,¯L])(z)≡vJ(f)J∗(f)v∗(z),
wherevis the row vector associated to L.A simple veriﬁcation shows that (4.2) is likewise a sum of
squares. Speciﬁcally, vJ(f)J∗(f)v∗(z) is a sum of squares with generators Lfj=/summationtextn
l=2vl(∂fj/∂zl),
j= 1,...,Nholomorphic near the origin. So the Levi form of a sum of squar es domain in
the direction Lhas an ideal representation, which we denote by /an}b∇acketle{tLf/an}b∇acket∇i}ht:=/an}b∇acketle{tLf1,...,Lf N/an}b∇acket∇i}ht.Now,

given in (4.3) will be useful in the model domain case of the id eal reformulation of the commutator
multitype in section 6. From Lemma 3.3, we know that every ﬁni te entry of the commutator
multitype at 0 can always be realized by the modulus square of a monomial in some generator of
the ideal of holomorphic functions. Thus each entry of the co mmutator multitype can be realized
by some list L={L1,...,Ll}of vector ﬁelds where lis even. Most importantly, there exists a
listL={L1,...,Ll}such that for every t,the vector ﬁelds Ltand¯LtinLmust appear an equal
number of times. Using this fact together with the fact that vJ(f)J∗(f)v∗(z) is a sum of squares,
we shall deﬁne the derivative of an ideal of holomorphic func tions. We ﬁrst note that /an}b∇acketle{tLf/an}b∇acket∇i}ht:=
/an}b∇acketle{tLf1,...,Lf N/an}b∇acket∇i}ht,the ideal representation of the Levi form of M is precisely th e ﬁrst order derivative

to the ideal /an}b∇acketle{tLf/an}b∇acket∇i}ht.Before we deﬁne the higher order derivatives of the ideal /an}b∇acketle{tf/an}b∇acket∇i}htwe consider the
deﬁnition below:

5.Normalizing the Boundary Systems
We give the proofs of the main theorems in this section. The pr oof of Theorem 1.1 relies on the
normalization results in Theorem 1.2. The proof of Theorem 1 .2 uses results from Corollary 1.2 in
[BNZ18] and Lemma 5.2 below. For easy reference, we state wit hout proof Corollary 1.2 as given
in [BNZ18] as Corollary 5.1 below:
Corollary 5.1 ([BNZ18], pg. 3) .LetMbe a pseudoconvex smooth real hypersurface in Cnwith
0∈Mand of the Catlin multitype
Λ = (1,λ2,...,λ n), λn<∞

Then there exists a holomorphic change of coordinates at 0preserving the multitype so that the
deﬁning function for Min the new coordinates is given by

withkjj>0for alljand the degree of pin each(zj,¯zj)is not greater than 2kjj.
Before we give the proof of the complete normalization of the boundary system for a sum of
squares domain, we give an answer to question (i) in the intro duction -namely, can torsion occur in
the boundary of any sum of squares domain in Cn? The ensuing lemma gives a negative answer to
this question by establishing that no torsion can occur in th e boundary. Recall that by Theorem 1.1
in [Aid22], the model polynomial of a sum of squares domain is likewise a sum of squares. Hence,
we state the following:
Lemma 5.2. LetM0⊂Cnn≥2be a model hypersurface of a model sum of squares domain D0
deﬁned by {r0<0},where
r0= 2Rez1+N/summationdisplay
l=1|hl(z2,...,zn)|2,
andhlis a polynomial consisting of all terms from the Taylor expan sion offlof weight 1/2with
respect to the Catlin multitype at 0,
Λ = (1,λ2,λ3,...,λ n), λn<+∞.
For any monomial fwith nonzero coeﬃcients from the Taylor series expansion of the generator hl
ofr0,for1≤l≤N,the function
(5.1) F(z,¯z) =Dαf
0¯Dαfr0,
is holomorphic. Here, αf= (αf
i1,...,αf
ik)for somek≤n,is the multiindex corresponding to the
monomialfandαf
0= (αf
i1−1,αf
i2...,αf
ik).
Proof.The normalization argument in Lemma 6.2 of [BNZ18] amounts t o showing that taking one
fewer holomorphic diﬀerentiation on the model polynomial th an necessary to obtain a non-zero
quantity in the computation of the commutator multitype yie lds a holomorphic function. Showing
thatF(z,¯z) is holomorphic accomplishes the same for a sum of squares do main in this lemma.
Letfandgbe distinct monomials with nonzero coeﬃcients from the Tayl or series expansion of
some generator hlofr0forlﬁxed with 1 ≤l≤N.If there are variables in fnot present in g,then
immediately ¯Dαf¯g= 0,so we only need to consider monomials gsuch that

respectively. To show that the function F(z,¯z) in (5.1) is holomorphic, it suﬃces to show that
¯Dαf¯g≡0 and¯Dαf¯u≡0,whereuis any distinct monomial from the Taylor series expansion of a
generator diﬀerent from hlinr0.Now, if for some j,1≤j≤k,the inequality αf

ijholds, thenCATLIN’S BOUNDARY SYSTEMS FOR SUMS OF SQUARES DOMAINS 13
it is easy to see that ¯Dαf¯g≡0.Thus, we only need to examine monomials fandgas given in (5.2)
such that for every j,1≤j≤k, αf
ij≤αg
ij.We shall now break the argument into two cases:
CASE 1. Suppose that k=cin the deﬁnitions given in (5.2). Then due to the weight restr ictions
in (5.3),αf
ij=αg
ijfor allj= 1,2,...,korαf
ij/ne}ationslash=αg
ijfor somej,1≤j≤k.Note that we
cannot have αf
ij<αg
ijfor allj,1≤j≤k,since this will violate the fact that both |f|2and
|g|2are in the model. Now, we consider the following:
i. First, suppose that for all j= 1,2,...,k, αf
ij=αg
ij.Thenf=gcontradicting the
assumption that fandgare distinct.
ii. Next, if αf
ij< αg
ijfor somej,thenαf
ij′> αg
ij′for some other j′because otherwise f
andgcannot both have weight1
2as seen in (5.3). Therefore, ¯Dαf¯g≡0.
CASE 2. Suppose that k < cin the deﬁnitions given in (5.2). Then αg
ij/ne}ationslash= 0 forj=k+ 1,...,cso
αg
ij< αf
ijfor at least one j,1≤j≤ksincefandghave equal weight1
2as seen in (5.3).
Hence,¯Dαf¯g≡0.
Now, letube any distinct monomial from the Taylor series expansion of a generator diﬀerent
fromhlinr0and supposethat uandfare distinct. Then since fandgare also distinct monomials,
it follows that by arguing in the same manner with ureplacingg,we can conclude that ¯Dαf¯u≡0.
Consequently, foranygiven pairofdistinctmonomials fandgfromr0,thecorrespondingsquare |g|2
and crossterm f¯gvanish identically after applying the operator Dαf

the operator Dαf

Remark 5.3. The term Ψi1in(5.4)is independent of the variable zi1due to weight restrictions.
As hinted in the introduction of this section, the proof of ou r ﬁrst main theorem heavily relies
on Corollary 5.1 and Lemma 5.2 above. Armed with these tools w e now give the proof of Theorem
1.2.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. LetMbe a sum of squares hypersurface in Cnwith deﬁning function

l=1|fl(z2,...,zn)|2,
wherefl(z2,...,zn) is a holomorphic function near the origin and assume that th e rank of the Levi
form ofMat 0 isq.From Corollary 5.1 there exists a holomorphic change of coor dinates at 0
preserving the multitype so that the deﬁning function rin the new coordinates is given by

withkjj>0 for alljand the degree of pin each (zj,¯zj) is not greater than 2 kjj.Note that since
Mis a sum of squares domain, all holomorphic changes of coordi nates will take squares to squares.
The proof here reduces to proving that at the level of the mode l hypersurface r0= 0,where
r0= 2Rez1+p(z2,...,zn,¯z1,...,¯zn),
forq+2≤j≤n,the real-valued function rjin the boundary system Bn(0) can be transformed
into the form Re zjvia a holomorphic polynomial change of coordinates. Via a Ch ern-Moser type
argument [CM74], we assume that the Levi rank at the origin is q= 0.Also, from [Aid22] we know
thatpis a sum of squares and so let p=/summationtextN
l=1|hl(z2,...,zn)|2,wherehla holomorphic function of

(5.6) |zk22
2|2+|zk32
2zk33
3|2+···+|zkn2

and applying Lemma 5.2 to the deﬁning function r0as follows: Denote by f(j) the monomial given
by
f(j) =zkj2

3···zkjj
j,for all 2 ≤j≤n,
and letαf(j)
0= (kj2,kj3,...,kjj−1) andαf(j)= (kj2,kj3,...,kjj).Note here that the deﬁnition of
the multiindices αf(j)
0still holds since kjj>0.From Lemma 5.2,
(5.7) Dαf(j)
0¯Dαf(j)r0=Cjzj+Ψj,for all 2 ≤j≤n,
whereΨ jis aholomorphicfunction. From Remark 5.3, Ψ jis independentof zjfor eachj,2≤j≤n,

we obtain an equally ordered list Lgiven by

Hence we compute rjas
(5.8) rj=L′∂r∼ReDαf(j)

Finally, we make a holomorphic change of coordinates that pr eserves Λ : zl→˜zlfor 1≤l≤n,
where ˜zl=Clzl+Ψlforl=j,and ˜zl=zlforl/ne}ationslash=j.Thus, in the new coordinates (after normalizing
the constants to 1), the real-valued function rjin (5.8) becomes
(5.9) rj= Rezj,
for all 2≤j≤n.

We shall prove Theorem 1.1 by establishing the two inequalit iesM(0)≤C(0) andM(0)≥C(0).
The proof of the ﬁrst inequality is easy and is also given in [C at84a] Theorem 3.7, for a general
pseudoconvex domain in Cn. We are therefore interested in showing that M(0)≥C(0) for any sum
of squares domain. The proof of the second inequality for a ge neral pseudoconvex domain is also
given by Catlin in [Cat84a] via a simultaneous inductive arg ument, but the details of the proof are
very diﬃcult to read. Hence, for any given domain of sum of squ ares of holomorphic functions, we
shall present a very simple proof of the second inequality us ing results from Theorem 1.2.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let 0∈Mbe a smooth real hypersurface in Cnwith deﬁning function
r= Rez1+N/summationdisplay
j=1|fj(z2,...,zn)|2,
wheref1,...,fNare holomorphic functions near 0 and suppose that Bn(0) is the boundary system
deﬁnednear the origin. Let C(0) bethe commutator multitype at 0associated to Bn(0) and suppose
that both C(0) andM(0),the multitype at 0, are ﬁnite.
We will show that M(0)≥C(0).By deﬁnition, the multitype is the inﬁmum of all distinguish ed
weights and so M≥Λ,where Λ ∈˜Γ,the set of all distinguished weights. Therefore, it suﬃces t o
show that C(0) is a distinguished weight. From Corollary 5.1 applied in the proof of Theorem 1.2,
there exists a holomorphic change of coordinates that trans forms the deﬁning function rinto the
form given in (2.3) in Remark 2.5. The complete normalizatio n result from Theorem 1.2 ensures
that there exists a holomorphic change of coordinates, whic h maps (z1,...,zn) to the origin and
also transforms rinto the form in (2.3). Hence, the weight C(0) at 0, generated from Bn(0) is a
distinguished weight. This completes the proof of Theorem 1 .1.

6.Ideal Restatement of the Commutator multitype machinery
We reformulate Catlin’s technique for the commutator multi type computation in terms of the
ideal of holomorphic functions associated to the sum of squa res domain D.Recall that for any given
ideal of holomorphic functions /an}b∇acketle{tf/an}b∇acket∇i}ht=/an}b∇acketle{tf1,...,fN/an}b∇acket∇i}htassociated to D,J(f)J∗(f) is the Levi matrix of
M,where J(f) and J∗(f) are the complex Jacobian matrix and its conjugate transpos e respectively.
Also, recall that for every vector ﬁeld Lj∈T1,0Mwe associate the row vector vj,1≤j≤n,
wherev1= (1,0,...,0).The reader should note that if any vector ﬁeld is denoted by Lj,then its
corresponding row vector will also be denoted by vj.From (4.1), the 1 ×nmatrix [∂r1] is given by
[∂r1] :=/parenleftbig
∂z1r1∂z2r1···∂znr1/parenrightbig
.In general, we will denote by [ ∂rk] the matrix
[∂rk] :=/parenleftbig∂z1rk∂z2rk···∂znrk/parenrightbig

for somek∈Z+, rkis some real-valued function and ∂zi:=∂
∂zi.

and suppose that the rank of the Levi form of Matz0equalsq.Let/an}b∇acketle{tf/an}b∇acket∇i}ht=/an}b∇acketle{tf1,...,fN/an}b∇acket∇i}htbe an ideal
of holomorphic functions associated to Dand letC(z) = (c1,...,cn) be the commutator multitype.
Setr=r1.
The number c1is deﬁned by c1= 1,which corresponds to the weight in the z1-direction. Here, c1
is obtained from the condition [ ∂r1]vT
1,wherev1= (1,0,...,0) is the vector associated to the vector16 NICHOLAS AIDOO
ﬁeldL1=∂
∂z1∈T1,0M.Since the rank of the Levi form of Matz0isqwe getc2=···=cq+1= 2.
Hence, we choose holomorphic vector ﬁelds L2,...,L q+1such thatvj∈ker[∂r1] and such that the
q×qmatrix
(6.1) VJ(f)J∗(f)V∗(z0)
is non-singular, where V= [vkj],2≤k≤q+1,2≤j≤n,is aq×(n−1) matrix whose lth row is
vl= (vl2···vln).We denote by Lhmaxthe set of the vector ﬁelds L2,...,L q+1,which is a maximal
collection satisfying the condition in (6.1). The construc tion is done if q+ 1 =n; otherwise, we
continue the procedure in the following two steps:
STEP 1: LetT1,0
q+2denote the subbundle of T1,0Mdeﬁned by
T1,0
q+2={L|v∈ker[∂r1] andvJ(f)J∗(f)v∗
j= 0, j= 2,...,q+1},
wherevis the row vector associated to L∈T1,0M.At this point, we recall Deﬁnition 4.1
and Remark 4.2 given in section 4. Let sdenote an integer with s≥2,L={L1,...,Ll}
an equally-ordered list, and Lh={L1,...,Ls}its associated holomorphic list. Let lkbe
the number of times both vector ﬁelds Lkand¯Lkappear in Land letskbe the number of
times thatLkappear in Lh.Thenlk= 2sk.
Now, supposethat Lh={L1,...,Ls}is a list of holomorphic vector ﬁelds such that there
exists a nonvanishing vector ﬁeld L∈T1,0
q+2such thatLj=Lfor everyj,1≤j≤sand let
L′
h={L2,...,Ls}.Denote by F(z) the function
F(z) =vJ(L′
hf)J∗(L′
hf)v∗(z)
forz∈M,where J∗(L′
hf) andv∗are the conjugate transposes of J( L′
hf) andvrespectively.
IfF(z0) = 0 for all such lists, then we set ci=∞fori=q+2,...,n.LetLh={L1,...,Ls}
be a list of holomorphic vector ﬁelds that satisﬁes the condi tion that F(z0)/ne}ationslash= 0 and denote
byhτ(z) the function
(6.2) hτ(z) =v2J(L′′
hf)J∗(L′
hf)(v1)∗(z),
wherevjis the row vector associated to the vector ﬁeld Lj∈Lh(τ).IfF(z0)/ne}ationslash= 0 for some
listLh,then choose one denoted by Lh(q+2) for which sis the smallest and set cq+2= 2s,
where Lh(q+ 2) ={L1,...,Ls}.LetL′
h(q+ 2) ={L2,...,Ls}and setrq+2= Rehq+2
orrq+2= Imhq+2.We also denote by Lq+2the particular vector ﬁeld Lused to obtain
Lh(q+2).This ensures that the condition Lq+2rq+2/ne}ationslash= 0 holds.
Next, ifq+2 =n,then the construction terminates; otherwise, we ﬁnd the sub sequent
entries of the commutator multitype by following a slightly modiﬁed version of the ﬁrst step.
STEP2:Assume that for ν−1∈Z, q+ 2≤ν−1< n,the positive rational numbers c1,...,cν,
vector ﬁelds L2,...,L ν,and functions rj, j= 1,q+2,...,ν,have been constructed. Now,
we deﬁne a ν-admissible list as follows:
Deﬁnition 6.1. LetLh={L1,...,Ls}be an ordered list of holomorphic vector ﬁelds. We
say that Lhisν-admissible if lν>0 and Lhsatisﬁes the inequality

We proceed with the argument by aﬃrming that the following pr operties also hold from the
inductive hypothesis: For every j, q+2≤j≤ν−1
(i). The list Lh(j) ={L1,...,Ls}is ordered and j-admissible.

j= 0, j= 2,...,q+1},
fork= 1,q+ 2,...,ν−1.We compute the positive rational number cνby considering
j=νin properties (i) and (iii)-(v) above. We consider all order edν-admissible list Lhfor
every holomorphic vector ﬁeld Lν∈T1,0
ν.IfF(z0) = 0 for all such lists Lh,then we set
cν=···=cn=∞.IfF(z0)/ne}ationslash= 0,then we choose one with minimal length and denote it by
Lh(ν),where Lh(ν) ={L1,...,Ls}.Letskbe the number of times that Lkappear in the
listLh(ν) and letc(L) denote the solution to

Since Lh(j) isν-admissible, the solution c(L)∈Q+.LetL′

satisﬁes properties (i)-(vi). The process terminates afte r the last entry is obtained. Thus,
this procedure generates C(z0) = (c1,...,cn) the commutator multitype at z0.Letν≤nbe
the largest index such that cν<∞.We call the collection
Bν(z0) ={r1,rq+2,...,rν;L2,...,L ν}
of real-valued functions and vector ﬁelds a boundary system of rankqand codimension n−ν.
6.2.The Model Domain Case. We shall consider the Catlin’s machinery for the case where t he
domain in question is D0,the model of a sum of squares domain D.Assume that all the entries
of both the multitype and the commutator multitype are ﬁnite . LetM0⊂Cnn≥2 be a model
hypersurface of a model sum of squares domain D0deﬁned by {r0<0},where
r0= 2Rez1+N/summationdisplay
l=1|wl(z2,...,zn)|2,
andwlis a polynomial of weight 1 /2 with respect to the Catlin multitype at 0 .Assume that the
rank of the Levi form of M0isqand letz0be a point in M0.Here, we will adopt a slightly diﬀerent
approach to obtaining the holomorphic vector ﬁelds in the ma ximal collection Lhmax.We will derive18 NICHOLAS AIDOO
holomorphic functions h2,...,hq+1whose mode of construction will be consistent with methods
used to obtain the functions hkfork=q+2,...,nin ideal reformulation of the Catlin commutator
multitype machinery in subsection 6.1 above. Let /an}b∇acketle{tw/an}b∇acket∇i}ht=/an}b∇acketle{tw1,...,w N/an}b∇acket∇i}htbe the ideal of holomorphic
functions associated to the domain D0.The holomorphic functions h2,...,hq+1are constructed as
follows: We denote by Wt(z) the function
Wt(z) =vtJ(w)J∗(w)v∗
t(z),
wherevtis the row vector associated to the (1,0) vector ﬁeld Lt,for somet∈Z>0,and J∗(w) is the
conjugate transpose of J( w).Since the rank of the Levi form is q,we can always ﬁnd (1,0) vector
ﬁeldsLj∈Lhmax, j= 2,...,q+1,such that the function hj(z) given by
hj(z) =/parenleftbig
w1···wN/parenrightbig
J∗(w)v∗
j(z),
wherevjis the row vector associated to the vector ﬁeld Lj,is holomorphic. Also, each Ljsatisﬁes
the conditions that Wj(z0)/ne}ationslash= 0 andLj∈ker[∂r1].The condition Wj(z0)/ne}ationslash= 0 can be interpreted
for each vector ﬁeld Lj∈Lhmax,2≤j≤q+ 1,asvjJ(hj)(z0)/ne}ationslash= 0.It is also easy to see that
we can always choose the vector ﬁelds LjandLkfor 2≤j < k≤q+ 1,so that the condition
vkJ(hj)(z0) = 0 holds. Denote by W(z) the function
W(z) =vJ(L′
hw)J∗(L′
hw)v∗(z)
forz∈M,where J∗(L′
hw) andv∗are the conjugate transposes of J( L′
hw) andvrespectively.
By applying Corollary 5.1 and Lemma 5.2 to r0,we can always ﬁnd a list Lh(τ) ={L1,...,Ls},
q+2≤τ≤n,of holomorphic vector ﬁelds such that W(z0)/ne}ationslash= 0 holds and such that the function
hτ(z) =v2J(L′′
hw)J∗(L′
hw)(v1)∗(z)
is holomorphic. Here vjis the row vector associated to the vector ﬁeld Lj∈Lh(τ).Continuing
in a similar manner as in the construction given in section 6. 1, we obtain the following: For every
minimal list Lh(τ) ={L1,...,Ls}, q+2≤τ≤n,such that W(z0)/ne}ationslash= 0 holds, we get
cτ=c(Lh(τ)) andrτ= Rehτorrτ= Imhτ
so thatLτrτ/ne}ationslash= 0 is satisﬁed. Since hτ(z) is holomorphic, the condition that Lτrτ/ne}ationslash= 0 is equivalent
to the condition
(6.4) vτJ(hτ)(z0)/ne}ationslash= 0,
where J( hτ) is the complex Jacobian matrix of hτandvτis the row vector associated to the vector
ﬁeldLτ.Also,vjJ(hτ)(z0) = 0,ifj > τ.Finally, we shall consider an ideal generated by all the
constructed holomorphic functions. Now, let ν≤nbe the highest index such that cν<∞.Then
for any boundary system Bν,we denote by IBνthe ideal
h=/an}b∇acketle{th2,...,hν/an}b∇acket∇i}ht
generated by the holomorphic functions hj, j= 2,...,ν.We shall call IBνthe boundary-system
ideal.
