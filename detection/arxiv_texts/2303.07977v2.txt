Abstract  
Entangled multiphoton  source s are essential for both fundamental tests of quantum foundations  
and building blocks of contemporary optical quantum technologies.  While efforts over the past 
three decades  have focused on  creating multiphoton entanglement through  multiplexing existing 
biphoton sources with linear optics and postselections , our work presents a groundbreaking 
approach. For the first time, we observe genuine continuous -mode time -energy -entangled W -class 
triphotons with an unprecedented production rate directly generated through spontaneous six -wave 
mixing (SSWM) in a four -level triple - atomic  vapor cell. Utilizing  electromagnetically induced 
transparen cy and coherence control, our SSWM scheme allow s versatile narrowband triphoton 
generation with advantageous  properties , including long temporal coherence and controllable 
waveforms . This advancement is  ideal for applications like  long-distance quantum 
communications and information processing , bridging  single  photons  and neutral atoms. Most 
significan tly, our work establishes  a reliable and efficient genuine triphoton source, facilitating 
accessible research  on multiphoton entanglement.  
 
Introduction  
Generating entangled multiphoton states  (1) is pivotal to probe quantum foundations and advance 
technological innovations. Comprehensive studies have already shown that multiphoton 
entanglement (1) enables a plethora of classically impossible phenomena, most of them 
incomprehensible with any bipartite system. Unfortunately, we hitherto have at hand only biphoton 
sources based upon spontaneous parametric down -conversion (SPDC) or spontaneous four -wave 
mixing (SFWM). This has urg ed tremendous efforts on developing multiphoton sources (1−3) over 
past t hirty years. Among them, the most popular means is to multiplex existing biphoton sources 
with linear optics and postselections. This brings us the well -known exemplar of polarization -
entangled multiphotons (4−8) by constructing imperative interferometric setups. Although 
postselection might be acceptable in some protocols, it is generally deleterious for most 
applications since the action of observing pho tons alters and destroys the s tates. To avoid 
postselection, the second path considers cascaded SPDCs/S FWMs (9−12) or two SPDCs/SFWMs 
followed by one up -conversion (13, 14). In this way, polarization or time -energy entangled 
triphotons were reported by building sophisticated coincidence counting circuits. Despite no needs 
on interferometric settings, the attained states are intrinsica lly non -Gaussian due to unbalanced 
photon numbers between the  primary and secondary biphoton process, thereby making these 
sources very noisy and inefficient. Alternatively, the third technique (15−17) suggests  to 
coherently mix paired photons with singles attenuated from a cw laser to trigger triphoton events. 
Akin to the first method, this solution depends on erasing the photon distinguishability by resorting to the Hong -Ou-Mandal interference effect  (18). Though polarization -entangled multiphotons of 
inequivalent classes were experimented with postselection, th e low success rate an d required 
interferometric stabilization make this proposal not so practical. As photons are always emitted in 
pairs in SPDC/SFWM, this attribute resul ts in the fourth route (19−23) to make use of emission of 
multiple pairs by appropriately setting input pump powers. Though it seems easy to yield even -
number states, yet, dominant biphotons from lower -order perturbation of the par ametric process 
challenge detecting entangled multiphotons from higher -order perturbations. To have an 
acceptable fidelity, like the second way, a complicated detection system plus an interferometric 
setup is often inevitable in practice. What’s more, this  approach mainly allows to form polarization 
entanglement thus far. In  spite of these impressiv e achievements, all foregoing mechanisms are 
difficult to offer a reliable and efficient triphoton source for research and applications. 
Additionally, so far the re is no convincing realization of the entangled triphoton experiment in 
continuous modes. Driven by SPDC, one would expect that such photons could be naturally born 
from third -order SPDC (24, 25) by converting one pump photon of higher energy into three 
daughter photons of low energy. The idea looks simple and straightforward, but experimentally 
inaccessible owing to the lack of such a nonlinear optical material. As a result, developing a 
reliable triphoton source is still in its infancy even up to today.  
Coherent atomic media  (26), on the other hand, exhibit a wide range of peculiar properties 
including giant nonlinearities, prolonged atomic coherence, strong photon -atom interaction, and 
slow/fast light effects. Recently, these exotic properties have been skillfully employed to construct 
a novel narrowband biphoton source (27−30) basing on SFWM. Specifically, giant nonlinearities 
promise efficient parametric conversion, long atomic coherence leads to  narrowband wavepackets , 
and sharp optical response becomes a formidable  knob for shaping photon waveforms and 
temporal correlations. Unlike solid state sources, one unique feature pertinent to atomic ensembles 
arises from the dual role played by the third -order nonlinear susceptibility (3) in biphoton 
generation  (27, 31−33). That is, in addition to governing nonlinear conversion strength, the double -
resonance structure in (3) signifies the coexistence of two sets of SFWMs in light quanta radiation. 
Alternatively, entangled pho tons output from these two stochastic but coherent SFWM processes 
interfere and give rise to a nontrivial two -photon interference, namely, the damped Rabi 
oscillations. In general, their waveforms are entirely patterned by the convolution of a complex 
phase-mismatch function and (3). Other than these attributes, the nonclassical correlations shared 
by paired photons can be additionally manipulated by exploiting various coherent control 
techniques including electromagnetically induced transparency (26) (EIT ) to reshape optical 
responses. The interplay amongst diverse effects also enriches fundamental research and fosters 
technological innovations, inaccessible to other existing biphoton sources. Besides, flexible 
system layouts like backward detection geometry are more favorable to photon counting detection. 
Motivated by these adv antages, here we move one step forward and report the direct generation of 
continuous -mode triphotons entangled in time and energy from a hot atomic vapor cell. By 
utilizing the process of spontaneous six -wave mixing (SSWM)  (34, 35), we have not only obser ved 
the striking three -photon interference but also witnessed the residual two~photon correlation by 
tracing one photon  out, an intrinsic virtue of the W class of tripartite entanglement (34). By 
adjusting the system parameters, we have further achieved waveform -controllable triphoton 
generation. Together with an unprecedented production rate, our scheme has substantiated to be 
the first reliable platform that leverages multipartite entangleme nt research to an unparalleled 
level.  
 
Results   
As schematic in Figs. 1A -C, we are interested in yielding narrowband W triphotons from a 7-cm long 85Rb vapor cell with a four -level triple - atomic configuration at temperature 80C (or 
115C). The detail of the experimental setup is provided in Methods. In the presence of three 
counter -propagating cw laser beams (one weak pump ( 𝐸1,𝜔1,𝑘⃑ 1) and two strong couplings 
(𝐸2,𝜔2,𝑘⃑ 2) and (𝐸3,𝜔3,𝑘⃑ 3)), backward photon triplets ( 𝐸𝑆𝑗,𝜔𝑆𝑗,𝑘⃑ 𝑆𝑗 with 𝑗=1,2,3) are emitted 
via Doppler -broadened SSWM at an intersection angle of 𝜃≈4° to the principle 𝑧-axis along the

vapor.  (A) Conceptual schematic  of creating a W -triphoton state  via the fifth -order parametric nonlinear process. 
(B) The 85Rb energy -level diagram of the SSWM process.  (C) The experimental setup. Three coaxial input 
driving fields 𝐸1 (795 nm) , 𝐸2 (780 nm) and 𝐸3 (780 nm) are coupled into the center of an 85Rb vapor cell heated 
at 80C (or 115 C) to initiate the simultaneous generation of W -triphotons in 𝐸𝑆1, 𝐸𝑆2 and 𝐸𝑆3. An additional 
optical -pumping beam 𝐸OP is added to clean up the residual atomic population in the level |2> for preventing the 
noise from the Raman scattering . The generated photons are coupled into a data acquisition system by single -
mode fibers and jointly detected by three synchronized single -photon counting modules (SPCM) with filters (F) 
and Fabry –Perot cavities (FP) placed in front. To eliminate accidental  coincidences caused by dual biphotons 
and quadraphotons, an extra detection of the diagnosis photons 𝐸Diagnose  is applied to ensure the natural 
triphoton collection. All trigger events are then interrogated by a fast -time acquisition card with a computer.  
phase match ing direction, ∆𝑘⃑ =(𝑘⃑ 𝑆1+𝑘⃑ 𝑆2+𝑘⃑ 𝑆3)−(𝑘⃑ 1+𝑘⃑ 2+𝑘⃑ 3)=0. As depicted in Figs. 
1B and C, the three coaxial input lasers were coupled into the center of the 85Rb vapor cell with 
tunable frequency detunings ∆𝑗 and powers 𝑃𝑗; while the generated photon triplets were 
accordingly detected by three single -photon counting modules (SPCM 1 – SPCM 3) for coincidence 
counts after spatial and frequency filtering. Here, to avoid unwanted accidental trigger events 
induced by singles and dual biphotons, we placed single -band filters and narrowband etalon Fabry -
Perot cavities in front of SPCM j before detection. We notice that in three -photon joint clicks, the 
major source of accidental coincidences stems from double pairs from two different SFWMs 
simultaneously present in the detection system (Supplementary Information (SI)). Since these dual 
pairs may have similar central frequencies and polarizations as genuine triphoton modes, they 
cannot be filtered away simply by polarizers and frequency  filters. To exclude such double -pair false trigger events, in experiment we further introduced an additional SPCM d synchronized with 
SPCM 3 to serve as the diagnosis detector in conjunction with the rest two, SPCM 1 and SPCM 2. To 
ensure the atomic population to be mainly distributed in the ground level |5𝑆1

the measurement, an additional strong optical repumping beam ( 𝐸𝑜𝑝) was applied to the atomic 
transition |5𝑆1

2⟩ in alignment with 𝐸2 but without spatial overlap. With these 
preparations, we carefully adjust the system parameters, especially 𝑃𝑗 and ∆𝑗 of each input field 
𝐸𝑗, to promote the SSWM occurrence.  
Physically, the SSWM process can be understood from the effective interaction Hamiltonian

𝑉+𝐻.𝑐. (𝐻.𝑐., Hermitian conjugate),               (1) 
with three input (output) beams treated as classical (quantized) fields and 𝑉 being the interaction 
volume. In Eq. (1), 𝜒(5) denotes the fifth -order Doppler -broadened nonlinear susceptibility and 
governs the nonlinear conversion efficiency. In the Schrödinger picture, after some algebra, the 
triphoton state at the two cell surfaces can be derived from first -order perturbation t heory by 
ignoring the vacuum contribution (SI), and takes the form of

Here, ∆𝜔=∑(𝜔𝑆𝑗−𝜔𝑗)3
𝑗=1 , 𝐿 is the interaction length, ∆𝑘=∆𝑘⃑ ∙𝑧̂ is the phase (or 
wavenumber) mismatch, the phase -mismatch longitudinal function Φ(𝑥)=sinc(𝑥)𝑒−𝑖𝑥 ascribes 
the three -photon natural spectral width arising from their different group velocities. Besides 
conditioning the triphoton output rate, the 𝜒(5)-resonance profile also specifies the generation 
mechanism along with the photon intrinsic bandwidths. Overall, the state (2) outlines a few 
peculiar features yet to be experimentally verified: First, because of its non -factorization, |Ψ⟩ is 
entangled in frequency (or time), instead of polarization. Second, characterized by two 
independent variables, |Ψ⟩ conforms to the essential characteristics of the tripartite W class, that 
is, by tracing one photon away, partial entanglement still exists in the remaining bipartite 
subsystem. Third, since the triphoton waveform is defined by the convolution of Φ and 𝜒(5), two 
distinct types of Glauber third -order (as well as conditional second -order) temporal correlations 
are expected to be manifested in threefold (and conditioned twofold) coincidence counting 
measurement. Consequently, two very differing scenarios are ex pected to be revealed in triphoton 
coincidence counting measurement. Last, but not the least, the triplet production rate is linear in 
the intensity of each input laser and can be dramatically enhanced by orders of magnitude by 
optimizing system parameters . It is worth pointing out that all these striking properties have been 
well affirmed in our series of experiments. Of importance, this is the first experimental proof of 
the time -energy -entangled triphoton W state discovered a decade ago (36) but never realized.  
Experimental set up . In experiment, we optimized the SSWM phase -matching condition via 
contro lling the frequency detunings and incident angles of three driving fields so as to  effectively 
collect emitted triphotons. Upon triggering SPCM j, the temporal correlation was concealed in 
photon counting histograms saved in a fast -time acquisition card with 0.0244 -ns bin width, where, 
within in every time window of 195 ns, the detection of an 𝐸𝑆1-photon triggered the start of a 
coincidence event that ended with the detection of subsequent  𝐸𝑆2- and 𝐸𝑆3-photons. In most 
measurements, we collected the total trigger events over an hour and then analyzed the 
corresponding three -photon  coincidences from the histogram in the parameter space (𝜏21,𝜏31), 
where 𝜏21=𝜏2−𝜏1 and 𝜏31=𝜏3−𝜏1 are respectively the relative time delays with 𝜏𝑗 being the

and 𝐸3 beams are 𝑃1=4 mW, 𝑃2=40 mW, and 𝑃3=15 mW, respectively, and the corresponding frequency

Triphoton temporal correlation . As an exemplar of such, Fig. 2A displays one set of measured 
threefold coincidence counts from one recorded histogram after subtracting the accidental noise, 
giving rise to an intriguing three -dimensional temporal correlation with the 18.6 - and 19.0 -ns 
effective measurement time window along the 𝜏21- and 𝜏31-axis because of the employed dectors. 
For the 0.25 -ns time -bin width per detector, integrating all involved time bins yields the total of 
~6×103 threefold trigger events, which result in a raw triphoton generation rate of 102±9 per 
minute without account of the coupling loss and detection efficiency. This rate is orders of 
magnitude higher than any previous one, and can be further improved by applying more efficient 
SPCMs as well as optimizing the fiber coupling efficiency. From  the raw data, the background 
accidentals were estimated to be 6±1 per minute, mainly originating from the residual dual pairs 
as well as accidental coincidences of uncorrel ated singles and dark counts of the SPCMs. This low 
background noise implies that the undesired third -order nonlinear processes were well filtered out 
in the experiment. On the other hand, t he complicated pattern is a direct consequence of nontrivial 
W-triphoton interferences due to the occurrence of multiple coexisting SSWM processes in the 
regime of damped Rabi oscillations. As described previously, these processes arise from the multi -
resonance structure of 𝜒(5). According to our qualitative  dressed -state calculations (SI), there are 
four such coexisting channels, as schematic in Fig. 2B, coherently contributing to the observed 
quantum interference. To confirm that the emitted triphoton state belongs to the W class, we then 
used the acquired data to investigate the correlation properties of different bipartite subsystems. 
To do so, we integrated the coincidence counts by tracing away one photon from every triphoton 
event over that photon’s arrival time. In this way, we acquired the conditional two~photon

temporal waveforms with 𝜏21 or 𝜏31 as variables, and plotted them, respectively, in Figs. 2C and 
D. Interestingly, the conditioned 𝜏3-waveform in Fig. 2D exhibits a damped periodic oscillation 
with a period of ~6.2 ns (SI); while the 𝜏21-waveform in Fig. 2C reveals two superimposed damped 
periodic oscillations with another 1.7 -ns period in addition to the 6.2 -ns one (SI), an interference 
effect unusual to any existing biphoton source. In contrast, the triphoton waveform has flexible 
tempe ral widths, for instance, 28 ns along the direction of 𝜏21+𝜏31=15 ns (Fig. 2E). This 
contrasting phenomenon also supports our theoretical picture from alternative aspect, that the 
observed interference is caused by at least three sets of coherently coexisting SSWM processes. 
As demonstrated in SI, our qualitative analysis gives a good  account of the experimental data.  
Since the attributes of triphoton waveforms are dependent on the system parameters, this 
prompts us to manipulate and control their quantum correlations by means of tuning the input 
lasers as well as the atomic density or optical depth (OD). To this end, w e carried out a series of 
experiments to tailor temporal correlation by shaping their waveforms by varying various 
parameters. Two sets of such representative experimental data are presented in Fig. 3. In 
comparison to Fig. 2A, Fig. 3A shows the steered wa veform by reducing the power and frequency 
detuning of the input 𝐸2 laser. As one can see, the profile of the triphoton temporal correlation is 
dramatically changed in spite of the reduced generation rate 77.4±7.8 minute-1. Especially, the 
conditional two~photon coincidence counts manifest mono -periodic oscillations with the same 
period of 6.2 ns along both 𝜏21 and 𝜏31 directions, as illustrated in Figs. 3B and C . This is because, 
in this case, the Rabi frequency of 𝐸2 was tuned to be very close to that of 𝐸3. As a consequence, 
half of the multiple resonances associated with the emission of 𝐸𝑆2-photons (Fig. 2B) become 
degenerate and share the same spectrum. Likewise, the triphoton temporal coherence length along 
the 𝜏21+𝜏31=29 ns direction is enlarged to 40 ns. On the other hand, triphoton interference can 
be also modulated by altering the phase -mismatch longitudinal function Φ in Eq. (2). Akin to the  Conditional Two ~Photon

𝜏21 (black squares) and 𝜏31 (blue triangles) directions by changing 𝑃2. By increasing 𝑃2, the triphoton temporal 
correlation is shifted from the group -delay (G) regime to the Rabi -oscillation (R) region.  𝑗-Ch (𝑗=2,3,4) means 
the coherent coexistence of 𝑗 types of indistinguishable SSWMs. The experimental condition is same as that in 
Fig 2.  
biphoton generation,  the phase mismatch ∆𝑘 in Φ is determined by the linear susceptibility of each 
mode in SSWM via the EIT slow -light effect. As showcased in Fig. 3D, by augmenting the OD 
from 4.6 to 45.7, the triphoton temporal correlation is considerably modified by the dispersion 
relation of the at omic vapor and falls into the group -delay regime. In addition to raising the 
production rate to 125±11 per minute, the oscillatory curvature is markedly suppressed and 
replaced by the overall decay envelopes. This transformation becomes more evident when 
examining the conditioned two~photon coincidence counts. By comparing Fig. 3F with Figs. 3B, 
C and E, one can see that the enhanced dispersion apparently smears the damped Rabi oscillations 
along the 𝜏21-direction, implying that the narrower bandwidths defined by Φ(∆𝑘𝐿
2) regulate the 
bandwidths dictated by 𝜒(5) to obscure the interference amongst four sets of coexisting SSWM 
channels. Besides, the triphoton temporal coherence length along the direction of 𝜏21+𝜏31=50 
ns is also significantly prolonged up to 70 ns . 
To reveal the nonclassicality of the W triphoton state, we continued to examine the violation of 
the Cauchy -Schwarz inequality (37, 38)as well as the fringe visibilities of the observed Rabi 
oscillations. By normalizing the threefold coincidence events to the flat background counts along 
with the additional auto -correlation measurement of the collected 𝐸𝑆1, 𝐸𝑆2 and 𝐸𝑆3 photons, we 
found that the Cauchy -Schwarz inequality is violated by a factor of 250±55 in Fig. 2A, 154±
43 in Fig. 3A, and 79±21 in Fig. 3D. Note that here these values were optimized by filtering 
possible biphoton processes in measurement. Additionally, we observed that the fringe visibility 
of Fig. 2A can be as high as 90±5%. 
In addition to the above experiments, it is also instructive to explore the triphoton production 
rate and temporal correlation width as a function of the input pump power for further understanding 
the proposed generation mechanism. This has motivated us to  implement additional measurements 
and the experimental data is presented in Fig. 4. As one can see, indeed, the triphoton generation 
rate follows a linear growth in the input power 𝑃2 of the 𝐸2 field. For the temporal coherence 
length, we concentrated on the two~photon conditional coincidence counting along the 𝜏21 and 
𝜏31 directions. From Fig. 4, it is not difficult to find that increasing 𝑃2 results in the reduction of 
the correlation time. This stems from the reduced slow -light effect when augmenting 𝑃2. Note that 
Figs. 2A, 3A and 3D simply become one individual point in Fig. 4. Overall, our approach enables 
all-optical coherent manipulation to create the genuine triphotons with controllable waveforms.  Discussion   
In conclusion, we have for the first time observed the efficient dependable continuous -mode W -
triphoton emission directly through SSWM in a warm atomic vapor with a generation rate of about 
125±11 min-1. Moreover, due to the coexistence of multi -SSWMs, these time -energy -entangled 
W triphotons have resulted in various nontrivial three -photon temporal interferences. Furthermore, 
by manipulating the system parameters, the triphoton temporal correlations can  be flexibly 
engineered and tailored and demonstrate m any peculiar characteristics inaccessible to all previous 
mechanisms. As a reliable source, it is expected to play a vital role in probing foundations of 
quantum theory and advancing various quantum -based technologies in information processing, 
communicati ons, networking, imaging, metrology, etc.  
 
Methods  
Experimental implementation.  Experimentally, three coaxial driving beams 𝐸1, 𝐸2 and 𝐸3 are 
coupled to the center of the 85Rb vapor cell to initiate the SSWM process, as shown in Fig. 2. The 
relevant energy -level diagram is shown in Fig. 1B, where the atoms are prepared at the ground 
level |1⟩ (5𝑆1/2,𝐹=2). The other involved energy levels are |2⟩ (5𝑆1/2,𝐹=3), |3⟩ (5𝑃1/2), and 
|4⟩ (5𝑃3/2). The horizontally polarized weak probe 𝐸1 beam at the 795 -nm wavelength is applied 
the atomic transition |1⟩→|3⟩ with a large red frequency detuning ∆1 (2 GHz) so that the atomic 
population resides primarily at |1⟩. The other two strong coupling beams 𝐸2 (780 nm, horizontal 
polarization) and 𝐸3 (780 nm, vertical polarization) are near resonantly coupled to the same atomic 
transition |2⟩→|4⟩ but with changeable detunings ∆2 and ∆3. By carefully adjusting the phase 
matching conditions, the spatially separated triphotons 𝐸𝑆1, 𝐸𝑆2 and 𝐸𝑆3 with wave vectors 𝑘⃑ 𝑆1, 
𝑘⃑ 𝑆2 and 𝑘⃑ 𝑆3 are spontaneously emitted along the phase -matching directions with a small forward 
angle about 4  away from the three driving fields. Besides, we have added an additional optical -
pumping beam 𝐸𝑂𝑃 to clean up the residue atomic population in |2⟩ so that the Raman scattering 
can be suppressed from the transition |2⟩→|3⟩. To increase the fifth -order nonlinearity, the 85Rb 
vapor cell with a length of 𝐿=7 cm is heated to 80 C (or 115 C). In this regard, the reported data 
in Figs. 2 and 3A -C were collected at the temperature of 80 C; while the data presented in Figs. 
3D-F were obtained at 115 C. Also, the narrowband filters and customized interference etalon 
Fabry -Perot (FP) cavities are placed in front of each SPCM to filter the scattered driving lasers 
from the collected triphoton trigger events. After detected by SPCMs, t he trigger events are 
recorded by a time -to-digit converter, where the maximum resolution time of our recording card 
is 813 fs. In our experiment, the fiber -fiber coupling efficiency and the SPCM detection efficiency 
are 70% and 40%, respectively.  
Filtering possible biphoton processes from triphoton coincidence counts.  Although the 
triphoton generation by SSWM is the focus of the measurement, due to the larger magnitude of 
the third -order nonlinearity, it is necessary to consider the possible false counts from the biphoton 
processes. Based on the atomic level structure a nd the adopted field coupling geometry, there are 
seven crucial SFWMs (Fig. S6 in SI) that may result in accidental coincidences: (1) SFWM1 
initiated by 𝐸1 and 𝐸2, (2) SFWM2 by 𝐸1 and 𝐸3, (3) SFWM3 by 𝐸2 and 𝐸3, (4) SFWM4 by 𝐸3 
and 𝐸2, (5) SFWM5 by 2𝐸1, (6) SFWM6 by 2 𝐸2, and (7) SFWM7 by 2𝐸3. Specifically, the 
biphotons produced from the following SFWMs may contribute to the accidental joint -detection 
probability: (1) SFWM1 + SFWM2, (2) SFWM1 + SFWM3, (3) SFWM1 +SFWM4, (4) SFWM1 
+ SFWM5, (5) SFWM1 + SFWM7, (6) SFWM2 + SFWM3, (7) SFWM2 + SFWM4, (8) SFWM2 
+ SF WM6, (9) SFWM3 + SFWM4, (10), SFWM3 + SFWM5, (11) SFWM3 + SFWM7, (12) 
SFWM4 + SFWM5, (13) SFWM4 + SFWM7, (14) SFWM5 + SFWM6, and (15) SFWM6 
+SFWM7. Fortunately, the central frequency difference of the similar photons from SSWM and SFWMs are more than 3 GHz. Therefore, before being detected by SPCMs, the collected photons 
need to pass through the high -quality single -frequency band filters and the customized narrowband 
etalon Fabry -Perot cavity (with a bandwidth ~600 MHz). The bandwid th, transmission efficiency, 
and extinction ratio of the employed filters are 650 MHz, 80%, and 60 dB, respectively. After 
these measures, most of the biphoton noise can be filtered from the detection. In addition, the 
phase -matching condition for the SSWM  process is much different from those for the possible 
SFWM processes. For instance, the photons from SFWM2 have distinctive emission angles from 
those from SSWM. As a result, the three -photon coincidence counts in actual measurements are 
mainly determined  by true triphotons, uncorrelated singles, and dark counts. In practice, the 
biphotons and uncorrelated singles can be well filtered in the three -photon coincidence counting 
measurement by carefully adjusting the phase -matching conditions.   
Additional detection of diagnose photons 𝑬𝐃𝐢𝐚𝐠𝐧𝐨𝐢𝐬𝐞 . To further guarantee the detected photons 
that are really from SSWM, we have performed one additional detection of the two -photon 
coincidences 𝐸𝑆3 and 𝐸Diagnose  simultaneously in conjunction with the coincidences between 𝐸𝑆1 
and 𝐸𝑆2 by artificially introducing the diagnose photons 𝐸Diagnose . This arrangement allows us to 
greatly reduce the false three -photon trigger events from dual biphotons particularly. The 
experimental results of 𝐸𝑆3 and 𝐸Diagnose  are given in the SI. By the same reconstruction method, 
we notice that the trigger events from two pairs of biphotons can be safely removed from the data 
recording.  
The Cauchy -Schwarz inequality.   The nonclassicality of triphoton correlation can be verified by 
observing the violation of the well -known Cauchy -Schwarz inequality, which is defined by  
[𝑔(3)(𝜏21,𝜏31)]2
[𝑔𝑆1(1)]2
[𝑔𝑆2(1)]2
[𝑔𝑆3(1)]2≤1. 
Here, 𝑔(3)(𝜏2,𝜏3) is the normalized third -order correlation function with respect to the accidental 
background. 𝑔𝑆1(1), 𝑔𝑆2(1) and 𝑔𝑆3(1) are the normalized autocorrelations of the emitted photons 𝐸𝑆1, 
𝐸𝑆2 and 𝐸𝑆3 measured by a fiber beam splitter. In our experiment, the nonzero background floor 
in such as Figs. 2 and 3 is a result of the accidental coincidences between uncorrelated single 
photons. According to the measured data, we estimate that the maximum values  of 𝑔𝑆1(1), 𝑔𝑆2(1) and 
𝑔𝑆3(1) are respectively to be 1.6±0.2, 2 and 2.

I. Qualitative Theory of Time -Energy -Entangled W Triphoton Generation in Atomic Vapor  
Qualitative Derivation of Fifth -Order Nonlinear Susceptibility 𝜒(5) 
Nonlinear optics stands as a foundational pillar in the realm of generating, shaping, and 
transforming quantum light. In the pursuit of harnessing nonclassical light through the deployment 
of atomic ensembles, the optical response of these systems, encompa ssing both linear and 
nonlinear susceptibilities, emerges as a pivotal determinant shaping the characteristics of the 
resultant quantum states and waveforms. This influence is particularly pronounced when the 
interaction between light and atoms transpires in proximity to atomic resonance, and the 
nonclassical light generated is notably weaker than the input driving fields. Consequently, a 
fundamental challenge inherent in such scenarios is the derivation of linear and nonlinear 
susceptibilities governing th e interplay of the involved electromagnetic (EM) fields.  
In the realm of optical interactions, the computational landscape for determining susceptibilities 
becomes more intricate when dealing with scenarios involving multiple EM fields acting on the 
same atomic transition. In cases where only one EM field per at omic transition is implicated, 
established methods such as density -matrix formalism and master equations prove effective in 
calculating susceptibilities. Yet, as the complexity deepens, especially in the context of triphoton 
generation as examined in this study, novel strategies are necessitated.  
Wen and colleagues have contributed a valuable approach (31-33) that facilitates precise 
susceptibility calculations, particularly relevant for generating entangled photon pairs. However, 
when applied to the triphoton generation investigated herein, the methodology faces heightened 
theoretical calculations. This compl exity arises from the simultaneous presence of three EM 
fields−𝐸2, 𝐸3, and 𝐸𝑠2−within a single atomic transition |2⟩−|4⟩ (as depicted in Fig. 1B in the 
main text). Ongoing efforts are dedicated to advancing the exact derivations using this method.  
In the interim, we employ a “qualitative” technique −perturbation chain rule −to explore the 
optical response of atomic vapor in the context of triphoton emission and its associated optical 
attributes. This qualitative approach has found application in analogous atomic systems with 
comparable energy -level structures, yielding result s that align comparably. Moreover, it has been 
employed to analyze light -atom interaction (39-44) in the context of six -wave mixing (SWM) in 
the stimulated emission regime. As eluc idated below, while the derived qualitative optical 
response results  may not align seamlessly with the experimental data, they do furnish a reasonable 
framework for comprehending the observed triphoton behaviors.  
The foundation of this qualitative approach is firmly grounded in perturbation theory, which 
prioritizes the dressing steady states while overlooking the transient propagation influence. The 
initial stage involves perturbative examination of the SWM process, leveraging the framework of 
weak -field approximation. Subsequently, the dressing perturbation strategy is invoked, 
establishing a set of strongly coupled equations driven by the strong fields. This framework thus  
facilitates the determination of density -matrix elements via the perturbati on chain rule.  
Following the methodology akin to that expounded in Refs. (39-44), it is revealed that the fifth -
order nonlinear susceptibility 𝜒(5) can be approximately attained from the ensuing perturbation 
chain:  
𝜌11(0)𝜔1→ 𝜌31(1)𝜔𝑆1→  𝜌21(2)𝜔2→ 𝜌41(3)𝜔𝑆2→  𝜌11(4)𝜔3→ 𝜌41(5),            (S1) 
where 𝜔1, 𝜔2 and 𝜔3 denote the frequencies of the three input lasers, while 𝜔𝑆1, 𝜔𝑆2 and 𝜔𝑆3 
represent the frequencies of the generated triphotons. By solving the series of density -matrix  
 
3 
 equations, one can deduce the density -matrix elements 𝜌11(0), 𝜌31(1), …, 𝜌41(5) in Eq. (S1) through a 
stepwise progression. Given the nature of atomic vapor, the incorporation of Doppler broadening 
effects become imperative. After some lengthy calculations, we have finally derived the fifth -order 
nonlinear susceptibility characterizi ng the light -atom interaction, as displayed in Fig. S1. This 
susceptibility adopts the following form:  
𝜒(5)(𝛿2,𝛿3)=∫𝑑𝑣∞
−∞2𝑁𝜇13𝜇24𝜇23𝜇143𝑓(𝑣)
𝜀0ℏ5{(Γ31+𝑖Δ𝐷1)[(Γ21+𝑖𝑊𝐷−𝛿2+𝑖𝑊𝐷+𝛿3)(Γ41+𝑖𝑊𝐷−𝛿2+𝑖𝑊𝐷+𝛿3+𝑖Δ𝐷2)+|Ω2|2]
×[(Γ11+𝑖𝑊𝐷+𝛿3)(Γ41+𝑖𝑊𝐷+𝛿3+𝑖Δ𝐷3)+|Ω3|2]}.    (S2) 
Here, 𝑓(𝑣)=√𝑚Rb
2𝜋𝑘𝐵𝑇𝑒−𝑚Rb𝜐2
2𝑘𝐵𝑇 is the Maxwell -Boltzmann velocity distribution of Rb atoms in 
thermal motion, where 𝑚Rb is the mass of the Rb atom, 𝑘𝐵 is the Boltzmann constant, 𝑇 is the 
vapor temperature, and 𝜐 is the atomic kinetic velocity; 𝑁 denotes the atomic density; 𝜇𝑖𝑗 (𝑖,𝑗=
1,2,3,4) represents the electric dipole matrix element for the atomic transition |𝑖⟩→|𝑗⟩; 𝜀0 stands 
for the vacuum permittivity; Γ𝑖𝑗 is the decay or decoherence rate between levels |𝑖⟩ and |𝑗⟩; Δ𝐷1=
Δ1+𝑣𝜔31𝑐⁄, Δ𝐷2=Δ2−𝑣𝜔42𝑐⁄, and Δ𝐷3=Δ3+𝑣𝜔42𝑐⁄ are associated with the frequency 
detunings Δ1=𝜔31−𝜔1, Δ2=𝜔42−𝜔2, and Δ3=𝜔42−𝜔3, where 𝜔𝑖𝑗 is the frequency 
difference between |𝑖⟩ and |𝑗⟩; 𝑊𝐷±=1±𝑣/𝑐 depends on atomic velocity with 𝑐 the speed of 
light in vacuum; Ω2 and Ω3 are the Rabi frequencies; 𝛿2 and 𝛿3 define the spectral distributions 
with respect to the central frequencies of the emitted 𝐸𝑆2 and 𝐸𝑆3 photons, respectively. 
Additionally, it’s important to note that owing to the energy conversation in SSWM, the triggers 
for these two photons require the detection of the output 𝐸𝑆1 photon at frequency 𝜔𝑆1=𝜔1+
𝜔2+𝜔3−𝜔𝑆2−𝜔𝑆3. This alternatively implies that the spectral distributions of the entangled 
three -photon state need to satisfy the condition 𝛿1+𝛿2+𝛿3=0. 
When 𝑇=80C, the Doppler width is estimated to be approximately ∆𝐷= 555 MHz, orders of 
magnitude larger than the Rb natural linewidth. The atomic density is given by 𝑁=1.2×1011 
cm-3. The optical depth (OD), calculated as 𝑂𝐷=𝑁𝜎41𝐿, amounts to 4.6, where 𝜎41=
𝜔41|𝜇14|2
2𝜀0ℏ𝑐Γ41∆𝐷=3𝜋𝑁Γ41𝑐2𝐿/2∆𝐷𝜔412 stands for the on -resonance absorption cross -section of the 
transition |1⟩→|4⟩. At a higher temperature 𝑇=115C, the OD grows significantly to the value 
of 45.7.  
In accordance with our previous theoretical investigations (9, 27, 31-33, 39-50), the temporal 
correlations inherent in the triphoton generation are impacted by two primary factors: the spectral 
profile of the fifth -order nonlinear susceptibility 𝜒(5), as provided by Eq. (S2), and the longitudinal 
phase -mismatch function, which will be discussed in subsequent sessions. With this premise, we 
initiate our examination by delving into the at the structure of 𝜒(5). 
Similar to our earlier analyses ( 9, 27, 31-33, 39-49), the resonances originating from the 
denominator of 𝜒(5) in Eq. (S2) are centrally located around 𝛿1±=(∆𝐷2±Ω𝐸2)/2(1−𝑣
𝑐), 
𝛿2±±=(∆𝐷3−∆𝐷2±Ω𝐸2±Ω𝐸3)/2(1+𝑣
𝑐), and 𝛿3±=(−∆𝐷3±Ω𝐸3)/2(1−𝑣
𝑐). Here, the 
effective Rabi frequencies are redefined as Ω𝐸2=√∆𝐷22+4|Ω2|2+4Γ21Γ41 and Ω𝐸3=
√∆𝐷32+4|Ω3|2+4Γ11Γ41, with Ω2 and Ω3 being the original Rabi frequencies of the 𝐸2 and 𝐸3 
fields, respectively. Notably, the effective linewidths of these resonances are determined by the  
 
4 
 imaginary components of the denominator. These linewidths, Γ𝛿2=Γ21+Γ41
2+Γ21∆𝐷2
∆𝐷2+Ω𝐸2 and Γ𝛿3=
Γ11+Γ41
2+Γ11∆𝐷3
∆𝐷3+Ω𝐸3, are responsible for setting the temporal correlation lengths between generated 
triphotons. Importantly, these resonance centers and effective linewidths are both contingent on 
the velocity of the atomic motion, and are thus influenced by the Doppler broa dening effect.  
By analyzing the calculated 𝛿1±, 𝛿2±± and 𝛿3±, it is anticipated that there will generally exist 
four sets of indistinguishable SSWM processes, facilitating the production of time -energy -
entangled W -triphotons. As an illustrative instance, Fig. S2 visually presents the behavior of 𝜒(5) 
across different scenarios. A keen observation reveals that, upon velocity integration, for cases 
with low OD, four distinct resonances will typically manifest (Figs. S2A and S2B); whereas for 
high OD values, the possibility arises to coalesce four resona nces into two (Fig. S2C).  
Qualitative Derivations of Linear Susceptibilities 𝜒 
Apart from the resonance linewidths governed by 𝜒(5), the temporal correlation of triphotons 
is also dependent on dispersion, which stems from the linear optical response. By applying the 
appropriate perturbation chain rule, after some calculations we obtain the individual linear 
susceptibilities of the new  𝐸𝑆1, 𝐸𝑆2 and 𝐸𝑆3 fields, yielding the following expressions:  
𝜒𝑆1≈0,                (S3) 
𝜒𝑆2=∫𝑓(𝑣)−𝑖4𝑁𝜇242((1−𝑣
c)𝛿2+𝑖Γ22)
𝜀0ℏ[4((1−𝑣
c)𝛿2−Δ𝐷2+𝑖Γ42)((1−𝑣
c)𝛿2+𝑖Γ22)+|Ω2|2]𝑑𝑣,          (S4) 
𝜒𝑆3=∫𝑓(𝑣)−𝑖4𝑁𝜇142((1+𝑣
c)𝛿3+𝑖Γ11)
𝜀0ℏ[4((1+𝑣
c)𝛿3−Δ𝐷3+𝑖Γ41)((1+𝑣
c)𝛿3+𝑖Γ11)+|Ω3|2]𝑑𝑣.          (S5) 
Eq. (S3) is amply substantiated by the utilization of a weak input 𝐸1 beam coupled with an 
exceedingly large red detuning ∆1=−2 GHz from the transition |1⟩→|2⟩. This outcome 
indicates that the group velocity of the 𝐸𝑆1 photons closely approximates the speed of light in 
vacuum, 𝑐. To enhance understanding, Fig. S3 encompasses numerical simulations of 𝜒𝑆2 and 𝜒𝑆3, 
elucidating the features of their profiles. Consequently, the group velocities experienced by the 
𝐸𝑆2 and 𝐸𝑆3 photons are routinely derived using the formula:  
𝑣𝑆2=(𝑑𝑘𝑆2
𝑑𝜔)−1
=𝑐
1+𝛿2(𝑑𝑛𝑆2
𝑑𝛿2),             (S6) 
𝑣𝑆3=(𝑑𝑘𝑆3
𝑑𝜔)−1
=𝑐
1+𝛿3(𝑑𝑛𝑆3
𝑑𝛿3),             (S7) 
where 𝑛𝑆2=√1+Re[𝜒𝑆2] and 𝑛𝑆3=√1+Re[𝜒𝑆3] are refractive indices. The imaginary parts 
of 𝜒𝑆2 and 𝜒𝑆3 ascribe the linear Raman gain or absorption undergone by the 𝐸𝑆2 and 𝐸𝑆3 photons 
during their traversal through the medium. Armed with this insight, the computation of the 
longitudinal phase mismatch in the SSWM process becomes apparent. This mismatch is defined 
as 
Δ𝑘(δ2,δ3)=𝑘𝑆1−𝑘𝑆2+𝑘𝑆3−𝑘1+𝑘2−𝑘3,           (S8) 
where 𝑘𝑗=𝑘𝑗̅+𝜔
𝑣𝑗 (𝑗=1,2,3,𝑆1,𝑆2,𝑆3), and 𝑘𝑗̅ denotes the central wavenumber. Equation (S8) 
underscores the inherent spectral width of  the generated triphoton state, thereby serving as a natural  
 
5 
 determinant for the temporal coherence time due to the influence of light propagation within the 
atomic vapor.  
    To offer insights into the behavior of 𝜒𝑆2 and 𝜒𝑆3, we present an illustrative example in Fig. S3, 
showcasing their real and imaginary components post the Doppler integration. As one can see, 𝜒𝑆2 
and 𝜒𝑆3 typically exhibit two resonance structures, as visualized in Figs. S3A −D. This divergence 
from the four resonances observed in 𝜒(5) (depicted in Figs. S2A and S2B) can be attributed to the 
qualitative model employed for the calculation of linear (and nonlinear) susceptibilities. We are 
presently engaged in refining this understanding by undertaking precise theoretical computations 
of both linear and nonlinear optical responses, leveraging the accurate model ( 31-33) pioneered by 
Wen et al. The outcomes of this ongoing effort are slated for publication in an upcoming venue. 
Meantime, we are open to the emergence of alternative theories f rom the community, as the 
associated mathematics is highly complex. We enthusiastically welcome the development of new 
theories that can accurately characterize these optical responses. We are optimistic that this 
complexity presents an opportunity for our  work to inspire novel theoretical advancements. Unlike 
previous protocols that comfortably fit within the existing theoretical framework, our approach 
challenges it and encourages fresh theoretical development.  
Derivation of the Triphoton State |Ψ⟩ 
To calculate the resultant three -photon state stemming from the SSWM process at the output 
surface of the medium, we shall work in the Schrödinger picture. We commence with the following 
effective interaction Hamiltonian,  
𝐻=∫𝑑𝑧𝜀0𝐿
0𝜒(5)𝐸1(+)𝐸2(+)𝐸3(+)𝐸𝑆1(−)𝐸𝑆2(−)𝐸𝑆3(−)+𝐻.𝑐.,          (S9) 
where 𝐻.𝑐. means the Hermitian conjugate. Here, the generated 𝐸𝑆1, 𝐸𝑆2 and 𝐸𝑆3 photons are 
described by the quantized electric fields,  
𝐸𝑆𝑗(+)=∑𝐸𝑆𝑗𝑎𝑗𝑒𝑖(𝑘𝑆𝑗𝑧−𝜔𝑆𝑗𝑡)
𝑘𝑆𝑗,           (S10)  
where 𝑎𝑗 symbolizes the annihilation operator for the mode with the wavenumber 𝑘𝑆𝑗 and angular 
frequency 𝜔𝑆𝑗. Additionally, 𝐸𝑆𝑗=𝑖√ℏ𝜔𝑆𝑗/2𝜀0𝑛𝑆𝑗2𝐿. On the other hand, the three input 
continuous -wave (cw) lasers 𝐸1, 𝐸2, and 𝐸3 are taken as classical plane waves,  
𝐸1(+)=𝐸1𝑒𝑖(𝑘1𝑧−𝜔1𝑡), 𝐸2(+)=𝐸2𝑒𝑖(−𝑘2𝑧−𝜔2𝑡), and 𝐸3(+)=𝐸3𝑒𝑖(𝑘3𝑧−𝜔3𝑡).      (S11)  
The state vector of the triphotons can then be ascertained through first -order perturbation theory 
(9, 27, 31-33, 39-51): 
|Ψ⟩=−𝑖
ℏ∫𝑑𝑡𝐻+∞
−∞|0⟩,            (S12)  
with |0⟩ being the initial vacuum state. By applying Eqs. (S9) −(S12) and ignoring the vacuum 
term that has no effect in photon clicks, the triphoton state (S12) can be formulated as:  
|Ψ⟩=∑∑∑𝐹(𝑘𝑆1,𝑘𝑆2,𝑘𝑆3) 𝑘𝑆3 𝑘𝑆2 𝑘𝑆1𝑎𝑘𝑆1†𝑎𝑘𝑆2†𝑎𝑘𝑆3†|0⟩,        (S13)  
where the three -photon spectral function 𝐹 is defined as  
𝐹(𝑘𝑆1,𝑘𝑆2,𝑘𝑆3)=𝐴𝜒(5)Φ(Δ𝑘𝐿)𝛿(𝜔1+𝜔2+𝜔3−𝜔𝑆1−𝜔𝑆2−𝜔𝑆3),      (S14)   
 
6 
 with 𝐴 being a grouped constant. In Eq. (S14), the Dirac 𝛿 function comes from the time integral 
in the steady -state approximation, ensuring the energy conservation in the SSWM process. From 
the perspective of atomic population, this energy conservation implies that after a triphoton 
generation cycle, the populat ion returns to its initial ground state |1⟩. Φ(Δ𝑘𝐿) is the so -called 
longitudinal phase -mismatch function, taking the form of:  
Φ(Δ𝑘𝐿)=1−𝑒−𝑖Δ𝑘𝐿
𝑖Δ𝑘𝐿=sinc(Δ𝑘𝐿
2)𝑒−𝑖Δ𝑘𝐿/2.          (S15)  
Due to the Doppler effect in 𝜒(5) and Δ𝑘, an exact analytical expression for the triphoton state 
(S13) becomes challenging. Instead, hereafter we will rely on numerical analysis to unveil the 
triphoton properties.  
Derivations of Temporal Correlations of W Triphotons  
The optical properties of the W -type triphotons can be comprehensively understood by 
examining their photon statistics through photon -counting measurements. Consequently, we delve 
into the temporal correlation of triphotons by evaluating the Glauber second -order and third -order 
correlation functions. This exploration then prompts us to carry out the analysis of conditioned 
two~photon coincidence counts and three -photon coincidence counts.  
In line with the experimental setup illustrated in Fig. 1 of the main text, the average triphoton 
coincidence counting rate is expressed as:  
𝑅3=lim
𝑇→∞1
𝑇∫𝑑𝑡1𝑇
0∫𝑑𝑡2𝑇
0∫𝑑𝑡3⟨Ψ|𝑇
0𝐸𝑆1(−)(𝜏1)𝐸𝑆2(−)(𝜏2)𝐸𝑆3(−)(𝜏3)𝐸𝑆3(+)(𝜏3)𝐸𝑆2(+)(𝜏2)𝐸𝑆1(+)(𝜏1)|Ψ⟩, 
                          (S16)  
and the conditional two~photon coincidence counting rate is:  
𝑅2=lim
𝑇→∞1
𝑇∫𝑑𝑡1𝑇
0∫𝑑𝑡2𝑇
0⟨Ψ|𝐸𝑆2(−)(𝜏2)𝐸𝑆3(−)(𝜏3)𝐸𝑆3(+)(𝜏3)𝐸𝑆2(+)(𝜏2)|Ψ⟩,      (S17)  
assuming, for instance, that the 𝐸𝑠1 photons are traced away. In Eqs. (S16) and (S17), 𝐸𝑆𝑗(+)(𝜏𝑗) 
(𝑗=1,2,3) is the positive frequency part of the free -space electric field evaluated at the spatial 
coordinate 𝑟𝑗 of the 𝑗th detector alongside with its trigger (or click) time 𝑡𝑗, with 𝜏𝑗=𝑡𝑗−𝑟𝑗/𝑐. 
For simplicity, we consider the efficiencies of all involved single -photon detectors to be unity. In 
addition, given that the narrow bandwidths (less than GHz) of the triphotons in question are 
comparable to or smaller than the spectral resolving width o f the utilized single -photon detectors 
in our experiment, we can simplify Eqs. (S16) and (17) to:  
𝑅3=|⟨0|𝐸𝑆3(+)(𝜏3)𝐸𝑆2(+)(𝜏2)𝐸𝑆1(+)(𝜏1)|Ψ⟩|2
=|𝐴3(𝜏1,𝜏2,𝜏3)|2,       (S18)  
𝑅2=∑|⟨0|𝑎𝑘𝑆1𝐸𝑆3(+)(𝜏3)𝐸𝑆2(+)(𝜏2)|Ψ⟩|2
𝑘𝑆1=∑|𝐴2(𝜏2,𝜏3)|2
𝑘𝑆1,       (S19)  
where 𝐴3(𝜏) is often referred to as the three -photon amplitude or triphoton waveform. Notably, 
𝐴2(𝜏) also represents the three -photon amplitude, even though one subsystem is not detected in 
the experiment. It’s essential to emphasize that both 𝐴3(𝜏) and 𝐴2(𝜏) are defined with reference 
to photon detections. By plugging Eq. (S13) into Eq. (S18), we attain:  
𝐴3(𝜏1,𝜏2,𝜏3)=𝐴3∑∑∑𝑒−𝑖(𝜔𝑆1𝜏1+𝜔𝑆2𝜏2+𝜔𝑆3𝜏3)𝐹(𝑘𝑆1,𝑘𝑆2,𝑘𝑆3) 𝑘𝑆3 𝑘𝑆2 𝑘𝑆1,      (S20)  
where all slowly varying terms and constants have been absorbed into 𝐴3. Similarly, by 
substituting Eq. (S13) into Eq. (S19), we get:   
 
7 
 𝐴2(𝜏2,𝜏3)=𝐴2∑∑𝑒−𝑖(𝜔𝑆2𝜏2+𝜔𝑆3𝜏3)𝐹(𝑘𝑆1,𝑘𝑆2,𝑘𝑆3) 𝑘𝑆3 𝑘𝑆2,        (S21)  
where again, all the slowly varying terms and constants have been grouped into 𝐴2. Furthermore, 
to evaluate the Dirac 𝛿 function in 𝐹 (S14), we replace the summation over wavenumber with an 
angular frequency integral as usual,  
∑→𝑘𝑆𝑗𝐿
2𝜋∫𝑑𝜔𝑆𝑗𝑑𝑘𝑆𝑗
𝑑𝜔𝑆𝑗=𝐿
2𝜋∫𝑑𝜔𝑆𝑗
𝑣𝑆𝑗.           (S22)  
Using Eqs. (S13) and (S22), the three -photon amplitude (S20) becomes  
𝐴2(𝜏21,𝜏31)=𝐴3∫∫𝑑𝛿2𝑑𝛿3𝜒(5)(𝛿2,𝛿3)sinc[Δ𝑘(𝛿2,𝛿3)𝐿
2]𝑒−𝑖𝛿2(𝜏21+𝐿/2𝑣𝑆2)𝑒−𝑖𝛿3(𝜏31+𝐿/2𝑣𝑆3). 
        (S23) 
The three -photon coincidence counting rate (S18) is simply modulus squared of 𝐴3(𝜏21,𝜏31), i.e.,  
𝑅3=|𝐴3(𝜏21,𝜏31)|2. 
From Eq. (S23), it is evident that the three -photon amplitude 𝐴3(𝜏21,𝜏31) is the convolution of 
the fifth -order nonlinear susceptibility 𝜒(5)(𝛿2,𝛿3) and the longitudinal phase -mismatch function 
Φ(Δ𝑘𝐿). Physically, this implies that the triphoton temporal coherence is jointly determined by 
these two factors. As a consequence, we anticipate the appearance of two distinct regions in three -
photon temporal correlation measurements, characterized by the damp ed Rabi oscillation regime 
dominated by 𝜒(5) and the group -delay regime dominated by Φ(Δ𝑘𝐿). These regions have been 
explored in the experiment, and the recorded data are presented in Figs. 2 −4 of the main text, as 
well as in Supplementary Figs. S11 and S12 (below). For qualitative comparison, Fig. S4 provides 
the corresponding theoretical simulations. It is apparent that both Figs. S4A and S4B exhibit the 
three -photon coincidence counts in the  damped Rabi oscillation regime, while Fig. 4C displays the 
case in the group -delay region, qualitatively explaining the experimental observations in Figs.  2A, 
3A, and 3D of the main text . 
Similarly, we can demonstrate that the conditioned two~photon coincidence counting rate can 
be computed as:  
𝑅2(𝜏23)=𝑅2∫𝑑𝛿3|∫𝑑𝛿2𝜒(5)(𝛿2,𝛿3)sinc[Δ𝑘(𝛿2,𝛿3)𝐿
2]𝑒−𝑖𝛿2(𝜏23+𝐿/2𝑣𝑆2)|2
,      (S24)  
where 𝜏23=𝜏2−𝜏3 and 𝑅2 is a grouped constant. As evident from Eq. (S24), 𝑅2(𝜏23) is a 
function of 𝜏23, indicating the presence of partial entanglement between the remaining 𝐸𝑆2 and 
𝐸𝑆3 photons after tracing away the 𝐸𝑆1 photon. This unequivocally signifies the tripartite W -class 
property.  
In Eq. (S24), the second integral inside the modulus squared is a convolution between 𝜒(5) and 
Φ(Δ𝑘𝐿). Similarly, the functional profile of 𝑅2(𝜏23) is in general determined by both factors. 
However, if one of these factors predominates, 𝑅2(𝜏23) will showcase two distinctive scenarios: 
the damped Rabi oscillation regime and the group -delay regime. Other configurations for 
conditional two~photon coincidence counts can be calculated using the same logic. Here, we 
refrain from reiterating those comp utations and leave them as an exercise for the reader. In Figs. 
2C and 2D, as well as Figs. 3B, 3C, 3E, and 3F in the main text, we present examples of such 
measured conditional two~photon coincidence counts. For qualitative comparison, Fig. S5 
provides t he corresponding theoretical simulations. It is evident that our theoretical framework 
aligns qualitatively with the experimental results.  However, when comparing qualitative 
calculations with actual experimental data, significant differences become apparent. Wen and his  
 
8 
 colleagues have recently advanced in precise calculations of linear and nonlinear optical responses 
using the harmonic expansion method he developed. Initial calculations indicate promising 
agreement between theory and experiment. Further verification is u nderway, and the detailed 
results will be published in a separate publication.  
Triphoton W State Entangled in Other Degrees of Freedom  
While the primary focus of this study revolves around time -energy -entangled W triphotons, it 
is important to acknowledge that these W -class triphotons can also be readily entangled in other 
degrees of freedom, encompassing space -momentum, polarization, and  orbital angular 
momentum. In other words, our work uniquely provides a dependable genuine W -class triphoton 
source, capable of generating a range of three -photon W states entangled across diverse degrees 
of freedom without involving additional interferome try setups or postselection. For example, our 
triphoton source can effortlessly yield triphotons entangled in space or momentum due to phase 
matching. Our source can also directly produce polarization -based W triphotons, without 
necessitating an interferom eter, by inputting three linearly polarized cw lasers. The heightened 
SSWM process facilitated by atomic coherence enables the exploration of diverse forms of three -
photon entanglement based on different degrees of freedom. This would be challenging or eve n 
unattainable using previously proposed schemes or methods.  
Furthermore, our system exhibits the capability to generate triphoton hyperentangled states, 
entangling more than one degree of freedom of light. This introduces a significant technical 
challenge for any multiphoton generation platform reported thus far. W hile the system layouts and 
theoretical calculations concerning these triphoton entangled states are beyond the scope of this 
work, they will be elaborated upon in the forthcoming discussions.  
Significantly, triphotons entangled in distinct degrees of freedom offer unique opportunities for 
quantum technological applications. For instance, the W -type triphotons endowed with spatial 
correlations (52-54) can be harnessed for quantum imaging and remoting sensing, enabling sub -
Rayleigh superresolution  that is both beyond the capabilities of biphotons (or entangled photon 
pairs) and classical light. This solidifies the fundamentally quantum nature of these phenomena 
and their potential to redefine quantum technologies.  
Beyond the primary focus on the continuous -mode scenario explored in this study, our system 
seamlessly extends its capabilities to encompass the continuous variable (CV) regime. Within this 
framework, the generation of non -Gaussian tripartite states become s a tangible achievement, 
facilitating their utilization across a spectrum of CV -based quantum information and computing 
protocols (55). This underscored adaptability and versatility inherent in our triphoton source stand 
as distinguishing features, settin g it apart from many preceding methodologies overviewed in the 
main text.  
Addressing Misconceptions: Clearing Up Common Misunderstandings  
In what follows, we would like to clarify some misconceptions prevalent in studies related to 
multiphoton generation. Through careful examination of the existing literature, we are aware of 
several prevalent misunderstandings in the realm of multiphoton entanglement generation:  
• Equating multiphoton source with specific multiphoton state .  A prevalent misconception 
arises when the community conflates an “entangled multiphoton source” with “the realization 
of a specific entangled state.” It's crucial to discern the fundamental distinction between these 
two concepts. The former encompasses the latter comprehensively, while the latter represents 
only a singular instance. Our work’s significance lies in introducing a reliable genuine W -class 
triphoton source, capable of generating dive rse three -photon W states entangled across various 
degrees of freedom —eliminating the need for additional interferometry and postselection.  
 
9 
 Although we demonstrated time -energy triphoton entanglement, our source effortlessly 
produces triphotons entangled in space or momentum due to phase matching. This starkly 
contrasts with most prior multiphoton state demonstrations, which only achieve detec tion 
potential without acting as dependable multiphoton sources. Our approach, in contrast, ensures 
exclusive production of desired states due to the unique phase matching, guaranteeing 
confident, high -purity, and high -fidelity triphoton generation.  
• Comparing incompatible classes .  Recognizing the essential incongruity between the GHZ and 
W classes is paramount. This divergence underscores the importance of contextualizing the 
superiority of one class over the other within specific problems or applications. Without this 
contextual  framework, any comparison lacks substantive relevance, rendering it incapable of 
enriching our understanding of multipartite entanglement. Furthermore, this inherent 
incompatibility leads to an intriguing consequence: any end eavor to transform a given class 
into its opposite counterpart demands the incorporation of supplementary interferometric 
setups and postselection measurements. Failing to do so renders such conversions unattainable.  
• Multiphoton production utilizing cascaded SPDCs/SFWMs .  the utilization of cascaded SPDCs 
or SFWMs for generating time -energy triphotons has demonstrated constrained dependability 
and suboptimal fidelity. This issue stems from the necessity of preserving over thousands of 
single photons resulting from the in itial SPDC or SFWM process, awaiting the emergence of 
a singular pair from the subsequent process. As a consequence, in the absence of sophisticated 
detection systems, ensuring consistent production of a  solitary triphoton entity remains elusive. 
This inherent limitation renders the feasibility of these methodologies ineffectual for 
establishing a dependable and authentic triphoton source.  
• Comprehending multiphoton entanglement with biphoton knowledge .  While our physics 
research typically begins by comprehending low -dimensional and simple scenarios before 
attempting to generalize to high -dimensional and complex situations, it is crucial to be mindful 
of the limitations of this approach when studying m ulti-photon entanglement. One significant 
challenge, as repeatedly emphasized, arises from the fact that, unlike the biphoton case, the 
triphoton scenario involves two incompatible classes. Unde rstanding these properties goes 
beyond the knowledge derived from the biphoton context.  
It also comes to our attention that even though multiphoton polarization -based GHZ state 
(including the four -photon case) can be derived from SPDC or SFWM processes —given that these 
processes generate photons in pair —one must recognize that these multiphot on outputs arise from 
higher -order perturbation terms. To effectively detect such photon states, the construction of 
sophisticated detection systems becomes imperative in order to mitigate accidental counts 
stemming from dual photon pairs. Without effectiv ely mitigating these prevalent photon trigger 
events originating from lower perturbations, the viability of establishing a reliable source using 
this scheme remains unattainable.  
All in all, despite the multitude of protocols proposed over the last two decades for generating 
multiphoton entangled states, as comprehensively discussed in the main text, our perspective 
suggests that none of these protocols have matured into dependable  multiphoton sources. This 
sentiment is rooted in the presence of inherent limitations and external challenges within these 
methodologies. Conversely, our devised scheme emerges as the most promising candidate to date 
for realizing a genuinely practical W -class triphoton source, bringing us notably closer to 
achieving this elusive goal.  
II. Further Insights into Experimental Measurements and Data Processing   
 
10 
 In the subsequent subsections, we would like to delve into the experimental measurements and 
data processing with greater depth. Additionally, we will present an extended collection of 
experimental data on triphoton coincidences, offering further evidence that the suggested SSWM 
process within coherent atomic ensembles efficiently produces genuine triphotons of exceptional 
quality and reliability. Notably, these supplementary findings, combined with the data presented 
in the main text, provide a comprehensi ve illustration of the source’s versatility. This versatility 
holds the potential to unlock novel technological advancements that are currently beyond the reach 
of existing photon resources.  
Possible Biphoton Processes  
As outlined in the Methods section, a significant source of accidental coincidence noise in the 
three -photon correlation measurements mainly stem from the simultaneous occurrence of two pairs 
of biphotons, originating from distinct spontaneous four -wave mi xing (SFWM) processes, 
detected by the single -photon detectors. Fortunately, these SFWMs exhibit differing phase 
matching conditions, deviating from the one pertinent to the SSWM process. Furthermore, the 
biphotons resulting from these SFWMs possess distin ct central frequencies in contrast to those of 
the desired triphotons.  
By meticulous manipulation of the phase matching conditions and the implementation of 
narrowband filters, the false trigger events from these biphotons can be effectively eliminated from 
the authentic triphoton coincidence counts. For a visual representati on of these biphoton generation 
scenarios, Fig. S6 provides a schematic depiction of all possible SFWM processes. Leveraging the 
level structure, seven such SFWM processes have been identified and visually presented in Figs. 
S6B–H. It’s worth noting that t he biphotons originating from these SFWMs constitute the primary 
source of accidental coincidences impacting the actual measurements. In the Methods section, we 
have extensively expounded upon the potential combinations of these SFWM processes that could 
lead to error -triggering events.  
While it is theoretically possible to generate entangled quadraphotons  through higher -order 
nonlinear wave mixing processes, the likelihood of their emission remains considerably low. 
Consequently, they do not pose a significant noise source for triphoton detection. Given this 
context, we will refrain from delving further in to the discussion of entangled quadraphotons in this 
context.  
Coincidence Counts obtained by Background Accidental Subtraction  
Figures 2 and 3 in the main text showcase the recorded data alongside background accidental 
counts. In the corresponding Figs. S7 and S8, we present the same measured data after background 
accidental counts have been subtracted. A comparison between Figs. 2 and 3 and Fig. S7 and S8 
underscores that the crucial characteristics remain well -preserved in both instances.  
In Figs. S7C, S7D, S8B, S8C, and S8F, we have incorporated green and red dashed lines based 
on the measured data to highlight the oscillation periods referenced in the main text. By 
juxtaposing Figs. S7C, S7D, S8B, S8C, S8E, and S8F with Figs. S4A1 –C2, we acknowledge that 
our qualitative optical response model can only furnish a qualitative interpretation of the 
experimental outcomes. Nonetheless, this approach effectively reveals fundamental features 
within the measurements.  
For a more comprehensive grasp of both conditional two~photon coincidences and conditional 
three -photon coincidences, we have extended our analysis beyond Figs. 2A, 3A, and 3D in the 
main text. By carefully removing the corresponding background accidental counts and exploring 
varied scenarios, we gain deeper insights. Figure S9 serves as an illustrative example of this 
processed experimental data, meticulously organized to adhere to specific conditions. Within these  
 
11 
 figures, it becomes evident that the coherence length of the residual temporal correlation for the 
two~photon scenario is not fixed; rather, it varies contingent upon the specific measurement 
conditions. This variability similarly extends to the coherence length of the conditional three -
photon temporal correlation. Importantly, these dynamic features were not discernible in prior 
demonstrations. From an alternative perspective, this observation also substantiates the 
adaptability and adjustability inherent in the generated three -photon state —a crucial attribute for 
its diverse range of applications.  
As a W state, the outcome of tracing out the 𝐸𝑆1-photons raises an intriguing question. Figures 
S10A -C respectively report the resulting conditioned two~photon coincidence counts between the 
remaining 𝐸𝑆2 and 𝐸𝑆3 photons for the cases shown in Figs. 2A, 3A, and 3D of the main text. Upon 
observation, we find that these profiles starkly differ from those illustrated in Figs. 2C, 2D, 3B, 
and 2F of the main text, as well as Figs. S7C, S8B, S8E, S8F, S9A1 -C1, SBA2 -C2, S12B, S12C, 
S13B, and S13C within the SI. The profiles manifested in Fig. S10 below are indeed anticipated, 
as the 𝐸𝑆1-photons do not experience the slow -light effect. As a result, the residual temporal 
correlations between the remaining 𝐸𝑆2 and 𝐸𝑆3 photons assume a nearly symmetrical distribution 
around the origin of time ( 𝜏32=0). 
Procedure for Reconstructing Triphoton Coincidence Counts  
Unlike standard two -photon correlation measurements, it’s worth noting that a commercially 
available generic three -photon coincidence circuit is absent in the current market landscape. 
Consequently, research groups are tasked with constructing their own de dicated three -photon 
coincidence circuits. As depicted in Fig. S11, we establish a detection system based on two -photon 
coincidence circuits. Specifically, within a predetermined three -photon correlation time window, 
we reconstruct three individual single -photon trigger events from SPCM 1, SPCM 2, and SPCM 3. 
This reconstruction is achieved through the simultaneous detection of two pairs of two -photon 
coincidence counts, namely {𝐸𝑆1,𝐸𝑆2} and {𝐸𝑆1,𝐸𝑆3}, facilitated by an additional diagnostic 
SPCM D.  
In practical experimentation, for each recorded three -photon coincidence count, the 𝐸𝑆1-photon 
click serves as a shared start trigger, initiating two electronic pulses I1 from SPCM 1. One of these 
pulses is subjected to a 150 -ns delay, as depicted in Fig. S11A. Concurrently, the detections of the 
𝐸𝑆2-photon and 𝐸𝑆3-photon serve as the stop trigger. Here, the electronic pulse I3 from SPCM 3 is 
delayed by 150 ns relative to the electronic pulse I2 from SPCM 2. With these intricate setups, the 
measurement of 𝐸𝑆1 and 𝐸𝑆2 photons is conducted first as a function of 𝜏21, followed by the 
recording of 𝐸𝑆1 and 𝐸𝑆3 photons after a 150 ns interval, captured as a function of 𝜏31. This 
methodology allows for the capture of three -photon temporal correlations within the context of 
coincidence counting measurements.  
To illustrate the functioning of each two -photon coincidence counting component, Fig. S11B -
D showcases a representative set of experimental data collected over a span of 5 minutes, 
employing a time bin width of 0.25 ns for each SPCM. It is evident that the  joint detection of 𝐸𝑆1 
and 𝐸𝑆2 photons elicits a two -photon temporal correlation, varying according to the relative time 
difference 𝜏21 between the clicks of the involved single -photon detectors, SPCM 1 and SPCM 2 
(Fig. S11B). Similarly, the joint detection of 𝐸𝑆1 and 𝐸𝑆3 photons unveils a residual temporal 
correlation, contingent upon the relative triggering time difference 𝜏31 between the clicks of the 
engaged single -photon detectors, SPCM 1 and SPCM 3 (Fig. S11C). As the diagnostic single -photon 
detector SPCM D is triggered by artificial electronic signals, coincident counting between 𝐸𝑆3 
photons and these artificial diagnose signals yields no exact temporal correlation, as demonstrated 
in Fig. S11D.   
 
12 
 Experimentally, capturing authentic triphotons through detection hinges critically on optimizing 
the phase -matching conditions of the SSWM process. This optimization is achieved by controlling 
the wavelengths and injection angles of the three input optical  driving beams, alongside the 
directions of triphoton collection. Beyond these arrangements, an additional layer of assurance is 
established to confirm that the detected triphotons originate exclusively from the intended SSWM 
process.  
This assurance is accomplished by implementing coincident counting detection. Here, the 𝐸𝑆3 
photons are jointly measured with artificially introduced diagnostic signals originating from 
SPCM D. This joint measurement transpires concurrently with the combined detection of 𝐸𝑆1 and 
𝐸𝑆2 photons. Utilizing the same reconstruction method outlined earlier, we obtain merely a few 
accidental coincidences per minute when employing the two -photon coincidences {𝐸𝑆1,𝐸𝑆2} and 
{𝐸𝑆3,𝐸𝐷} to construct the three -photon histogram. This outcome underscores the absence of any 
authentic quantum correlation within any two pairs of unrelated two -photon coincidences.  
Supplementary Experimental Data  
In the experimental domain, we conducted a series of three -photon coincidence counting 
measurements while varying system parameters. In addition to the data depicted in Figs. 2 and 3 
in the main text, we present an additional set of measured data. Illustra ted in Fig. S12, we 
accumulated three -photon coincidence trigger events over the course of 1 hour, utilizing a time bin 
width of 2.0 ns for each SPCM. Most experimental parameters remain consistent with those 
detailed in Fig. 2A of the main text, except fo r 𝑃2 (7 mW), 𝑃3 (7 mW), and 𝑂𝐷 (45.7).  
From the recorded data, it emerges that the triphoton production rate is 100 ± 11 per minute, 
accompanied by background accidentals of 8 ± 3.1 per minute. Notably, even in this scenario, the 
triphoton temporal correlation remains within the group -delay reg ime. This is substantiated by 
evaluating the conditional two~photon correlations, achieved by tracing away one photon from 
each triphoton. Fig. S12B and S12C present these conditional two~photon coincidence counts. It 
is evident that the previously observe d Rabi oscillations almost diminish in these two figures.  
Illustrated within Fig. S13, we present an additional series of measurements within the group -
delay region. A direct comparison with Fig. S12 reveals a significant reduction in the amplitude 
of the small oscillations observed in the preceding figures.  
III. Summary of Diverse Mechanisms for Multiphoton Generation  
In this section, we have consolidated the primary experimental demonstrations showcasing the 
generation of entangled three -photon and multiphoton states, which have been documented up to 
this point. We’ve compiled their essential parameters and resulting optical properties in TABLE 
I, providing a convenient point of reference. It is important to acknowledge that our intention is 
not to list every single experimental report within this compilation. Nonetheless, the reports 
included here serve as somewhat representative examples of the br oader landscape.  
IV. Extended Discussion on the Reported Triphoton Source  
It is illuminating to investigate the feasibility of the reported triphoton source in generating 
GHZ -type triphotons entangled in time -energy (and other degrees of freedom) (56, 57). To our 
current understanding, the literature lacks any single proposal for the direct creation of continuous -
mode time -energy -entangled GHZ triphotons. This absence stems from the requirement that, in 
order to establish such a three -photon GHZ state, two  of the photons must be degenerate in all 
degrees of freedom (54, 56, 57).

With regard to  our proprietary triphoton source, you might be intrigued by the possible outcome 
achieved through the arrangement of two of these photons into a degenerate state. Could such an 
arrangement potentially yield a GHZ state? In theory, such a scenario is indee d plausible. 
However, from a practical perspective, the execution of an experiment of this nature would present 
substantial challenges. Moreover, considering an alternative perspective, the development of a 
scheme for the direct generation of continuous -mode triphoton and multi -photon states entangled 
in time -energy and space -momentum domains still necessitates additional in -depth research 
efforts.

Fig. S 1. 
Energy -level diagram of hot 85Rb atoms illustrating direct time -energy -entangled W -class 
triphoton generation. This four -level triple --type atomic configuration features two ground states 
|1⟩ and |2⟩, as well as two excited states |3⟩ and 4⟩. Initial atomic population is established in state 
|1⟩. To prevent residual atomic population in |2⟩, an additional resonant optical pumping beam 
𝐸𝑂𝑃 is introduced for the atomic transition |2⟩⟷|3⟩. A weak cw pump laser  𝐸1 is directed 
towards |1⟩→|3⟩ with a large, fixed red frequency detuning Δ1. Meanwhile, another two strong 
cw control fields, 𝐸2 and 𝐸3, are concurrently applied to the same atomic transition |2⟩→|4⟩, but 
with different frequency detunings Δ2 and Δ3. By adhering to the required phase -matching 
conditions, the spontaneous six -wave mixing (SSWM) process is facilitated, enabling the direct 
and efficient emission of continuous -mode time -energy -entangled W -type triphotons —𝐸𝑆1, 𝐸𝑆2 
and 𝐸𝑆3—from their respective atomic transitions. This emission process is visually depicted in 
the diagram.
