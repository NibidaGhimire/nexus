ABSTRACT  
Despite spin (SAM) and orbital (OAM) angular momentum dynamics are well -studied in 
demagnetization processes, their components receive less focus. Here, we utilize the non -
collinear spin version of real -time time -dependent density functional theory (rt -TDD FT) to 
unveil significant x and y components of SAM and OAM induced by circularly left ( σ+) and 
right ( σ−) polarized laser  pulse in Ferromagnetic Fe, Co and Ni. Our results show that the 
magnitude of OAM is an order of  magnitude larger than that of SAM, hi ghlighting a stronger 
optical response from the orbital degrees  of freedom of electrons compared to spin. Additionally, 
we observe a marked dependency of the oscillations of the x and y components on the helicity 
of the pulse. Intriguingly, σ+ and σ− pulses induce chirality in the precession of SAM and OAM, 
respectively, with clear associations with laser  frequency and duration. Finally, we demonstrate 
that the time scale of OAM and SAM precession occurs even earlier than that of the 
demagnetization process  and OISTR effect. Our investigation provides detailed insight into the 
dynamics of SAM and OAM of electron during and shortly after a circularly polarized laser 
excitation.  2 
 
 
 Introduction  
Beaurepaire et al. [1] made a groundbreaking discovery, showcasing ultrafast 
demagnetization of ferromagnetic nickel within a subpicosecond timescale through 
femtosecond laser pulses — a process three orders of magnitude faster than that achievable with 
magnetic fields alone.  This discovery not only has profound implications for fundamental 
science but also heralds potential breakthroughs in technological applications.[2, 3] With 
advancements in generating ultrashort laser pulses, the timescale for spin manipulation has now 
reached femtosecond and even attosecond domains.[4 –7] Recently, Dewhurst et al. [8] proposed 
a new mechanism for ultra - fast spin manipulation, termed the optically induced intersite spin 
transfer (OISTR) effect, which has since received experimental corroboration.[9 –13] The 
OISTR effect demonstrates that optical excitation can cohere ntly and efficiently redistribute 
spins among distinct magnetic sublattices within tens to a mere few femtoseconds, positioning 
it as the most rapid method for controlling spin in  magnetic materials.[7]  
While the OISTR effect originates from light - induced spin -dependent charge excitation 
on femtosecond timescales and predominantly emphasizes the magnitude of spin transfer and 
its consequent demagnetization,[7, 8] it does not extensively address the chang es in spin 
component. This leads to pertinent questions: (i) How does the laser pulse influence the spin 
angular momentum (SAM) components during the OISTR effect? (ii) What role does the orbital 
angular momentum (OAM) play in the OISTR process? Addressing  these  questions is of 
paramount importance to gain a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies involved in the 
OISTR effect and its potential implications for ultrafast magnetization phenomena.  
Spin-orbit (SO) interactions play a fundamental role in the dynamics of demagnetization 
processes. This relativistic interaction breaks the conservation of the total electronic SAM 
(defined as S), potentially leading to a transfer between SAM and OAM (defined as L).[14, 15] 
Such transfers are critical processes that determine the speed of ultrafast magnetization 
phenomena. However, despite its paramount importance, the experimental evidence on the 
interchange between SAM and OAM re - mains ambiguous, as high lighted by studies using 
magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and x -ray absorption spectra (XAS).[16 –20] For instance, 3 
 
 
 Boeglin et al. [21] indicate that OAM might change even faster than spin in experiments. 
Conversely, recent theoretical studies offer insights supporting the transfer of SAM into 
OAM.[22]  
While much of the research has primarily concentrated on quantifying the transfer of SAM 
and OAM —demonstrating an initial angular momentum flow of L and S, which holds potential 
for experimental observation.[19 –21] However, the temporal evolution of the components of 
SAM and OAM, especially the x and y components, have been overlooked for a long time. The 
components of SAM could be brought about by photo - induced spin -polarized currents and the 
OAM of electrons is gaining prominence in the realm of orbitron ic devices.[23 –25] Pivoting 
back to the core issue of demagnetization dynamics, several important questions remain 
unanswered: (i) How do the directions of SAM and OAM evolve during the demagnetization 
process? (ii) What is the time scale for components of S AM and OAM (iii) How do their 
respective components of angular momentum interact and transfer via spin -orbit coupling 
(SOC)? Addressing these questions is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the 
microscopic processes underlying demagnetization d ynamics.  
To address the aforementioned issues,  in this work,  we present a detailed study of the time -
dependent components of SAM and OAM dynamics under the influence of a circularly 
polarized laser pulse, utilizing first-principles calculations.  We proposed the concept of chirality 
of spin and orbital precession and subsequently dissect the disparity in precession angles 
between OAM and SAM. Furthermore,  we explored the influence  of laser parameters on the 
precession for OAM and SAM .  
We employ the real -time time -dependent density func - tional theory (rt -TDDFT) to study 
the spin and orbital dynamics of Fe, Co and Ni metals. Previous applications of rt -TDDFT have 
successfully elucidated ultrafast spin dynamics in metals, Heusler compound s, metallic alloy - 
ing, and 2D magnets.[7 –10, 26 –29] The foundation of rt - TDDFT is the Runge –Gross 
theorem,[30] which posits that a time -dependent external potential uniquely de - fines the 
functional of time -dependent density, contin - gent upon the initia l state. In a fully non -collinear 
spin- dependent version, time -dependent Kohn –Sham (KS) orbitals are Pauli spinors governed 4 
 
 
 by the Schrodinger equation (refer to details in Ref.[31]):  
 
where 𝚨𝐞𝐱𝐭(𝑡)  and σ represent a vector potential and Pauli matrices. The KS effective 
potential 𝜐𝑠(𝐫,𝑡)  = 𝜐𝑒𝑥𝑡(𝐫,𝑡)+𝜐𝐻(𝐫,𝑡)+𝜐𝑥𝑐(𝐫,𝑡)  can be decomposed into the external 
potential  𝜐𝑒𝑥𝑡, the classical Hartree potential 𝜐𝐻, and the exchange -correlation (XC) potential 
𝜐𝑥𝑐, respectively . The KS magnetic field can be written as 𝚩𝐬(𝐫,𝑡) = 𝚩𝐞𝐱𝐭(𝐫,𝑡)+𝚩𝐱𝐜(𝐫,𝑡), 
where 𝚩𝐞𝐱𝐭 and 𝚩𝐱𝐜 represent the magnetic field of the applied laser pulse plus possibly an 
additional magnetic field and XC magnetic field, respectively.  The last term in Eq. (1) stand 
for the SOC.  We only time propagate the electronic system while keeping the nuclei fixed.  
   All calculations were employed by a fully non -collinear spin version[31] of rt -TDDFT by 
implemented through the full -potential augmented plane -wave ELK code.[32] We utilized a 12 
× 12 × 1 regular mesh in k -space, and the rt -TDDFT simulations were conducted with a time  
step of ∆ t= 0.1 a.u.  The smearing width was set to  0.027 eV . The laser pulses employed in our 
analyses were circularly polarized. Additionally, all calculations adhered to the adiabatic local 
spin density approximation (ALSDA), consistent with methodologies established in previous 
works.[8 –13] 
The circularly polarized field s can be written as  𝑨=(𝐴𝑥,𝐴𝑦,0),  
𝐴𝑥(𝑡)={𝐴0 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜔𝑡)𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜋𝑡
𝑇),
0,              𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 0≤𝑡≤𝑇                  (2)

𝑇),
0,              𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 0≤𝑡≤𝑇              (3) 
where 𝜑 is the polarization angle  and 𝜑 = ±90° are used for circularly  σ+ and σ− polarized 
laser  pulses . The second sinusoidal term  of Eq. ( 2) and Eq. ( 3) constitutes the temporal envelope 
of the pulse, in which T is a duration.  
5 
 
 
 We first consider a multilayer system of ferromagnetic  Fe, Co, and Ni, consisting of a total 
of six monolayers (ML). Subsequently, a circularly polarized σ+ and σ− pulse with a duration 
(fwhm ) of 9.68 fs, 1.63 eV (395THz) frequency and fluence of 7.1 mJ/cm2 was employed to ex 
cite the multilayer system. While the time scale for this  laser pulse aligns with that employed 
in the OISTR experiment as referenced in Ref.[7], it notably remains considerably shorter than 
the durations typically utilized in experiments probing the distinct responses of SAM and OAM 
dynamics.  The ground -state SAM and OAM of  the top layer of Co are presented in FIG. 1, 
accompanied  by the temporal evolution of these moments  under the  influence of σ+ and σ− pulse. 
We exclusively showcase  the SAM and OAM dynamics in the top ML due to the  similar 
properties exhibited by the other ML. The other  ML exhibits similar properties.  
 
 
FIG. 1. SAM and OAM dynamics are presented for the x, y, and z components under σ+ and σ− pulse 
excitations. The pulses are polarized with a full width at half maximum (fwhm)  of 9.68 fs, central 
6 
 
 
 frequency of 1.63 eV , and an incident fluence of 3.55 mJ/cm2. (a) Normalized orbital angular  
momentum, Lz (t)/Lz (0)−1, and spin angular momentum, Sz (t)/Sz (0)−1, are depicted for Co. The light 
gray and yellow oscillating lines correspond to the Ax and Ay components of the vector potential  of the 
pump pulse, respectively. Time -dependent x (magenta line) and y (blue line) components of SAM 
dynamics under the σ+ (c) and σ− (d) pulses. For SAM, x (pink line) and y (olive line) components 
under the σ+ (e) and σ− (f) pulse excitations are shown.  
 
We now turn our attention to the x and y components (defined as Lx, Ly, Sx and Sy) of both SAM 
and OAM. In their ground states, Lx, Ly, Sx and Sy are minimal values. OAM generally quenched 
due to the motion of electrons in lattice. Interestingly, our results unequivocally demonstrate 
that a circularly polarized laser pulse induces substantial enhancements in the x and y com- 
ponents of both SAM and OAM for Fe, Co, and Ni, as depicted in FIG. 1c -f. (refer to FIG. S1 
and S2 in the  supporting materials for Fe and Ni) These metals man - ifest analogous responses 
when subjected to σ+ and σ− pulses. From FIG. 1, We generally observed Lx, Ly, Sx and Sy 
demonstrate significant rapid oscillations associated with the frequency of laser ( flaser). And Lx, 
Ly, Sx and Sy show a general increase in the amplitude of oscillation after laser pulse excitation 
peaking at the culmi - nation of the pump pulse. Subsequently, the oscillations begin to decay 
and ultimately leading to disorganized behavior following the pulse concludes . For OAM, the 
decay for amplitudes of Lx and Ly oscillation induced by  both σ+ and σ− pulses are nearly 
identical. However, for  SAM, the Sx and Sy manifest strong helicity -dependent oscillation 
behaviour. Specifically, σ+ induced oscillated  amplitude of Sx and Sy quickly decay, while those 
induced by σ− exhibit a notably slower decay. Importantly,  we note that the OAM amplitudes 
are approximately 20 times larger than those of SAM, demonstrating that the orbital degree of 
freedom of electrons have stronger optical response than that of spin. FIG. 1 clearly illustrates 
that the oscillations of the x and y components precede  the reduction of z-component of both 
SAM and OAM. These results indicate that the x and y components pl ay an important role in 
the early stages of demagnetization dynamics.  
 7 
 
 
 The x and y components of both spin and orbital an - gular momenta for Fe, Co and Ni 
exhibit a regular oscillation, strongly suggesting an optical helicity -driven precession. FIG. 2 
provides visual evidence of this phenomenon, (refer to FIG. S3 and S4 in the supporting  
materials for Fe and Ni) where σ− light induces a regular left -handed (LH) helix, while σ− light 
induces a corresponding right -handed (RH) helix in the x and y components of spin and orbital 
angular momentum. Notably, these helices originate from the orig in and steadily in - crease in 
amplitude until the laser pulse reaches its peak intensity. Subsequently, the helices tend to return 
to the origin: we also can observe the oscillatory decay in the x and y components of spin and 
orbital angular momenta as shown in FIG. 1. Furthermore, our observations indicate that σ+ 
pulse induces a larger amplitude of precession in spin compared to the precession induced by 
σ− pulse. That means the spin dynamics show the optical  helicity -dependent precession. We can 
also see that the amplitude of orbital for precession is significantly larger than that of spin, 
which suggest that OAM will has the larger obliquity of precession than SAM. These findings 
reveal physical pictures of early dynamics of SAM and OAM under the infl uence of circularly 
polarized light, which is important for understanding ultrafast demagnetization processes in 
magnetic materials.

circularly polarized pulse. Pan - els (a) and (b) depict the LH and RH precession of SAM under  
σ+ and σ− pulses, respectively. Panels (c) and (d) illustrate the LH and RH precession of OAM 
under σ+ and σ− pulses, respectively. The color maps indicate the time scale from the  
start to the end of the pulse.  
 
FIG. 3.  Laser -induced torques and obliquity of precession  for L, S and J. (a) direction -

precession obliquity for (b) SAM θS , (c) OAM θL and (d) total angular momentum θJ induced by 
σ+ (purple line) and σ− (blue line) laser pulse. Inserted schematic illustrations repre - sent the σ+ 
and σ− laser pulse induced left -handed (LH) and right -handed (RH) precession of L, S and J, 
respectively. The  green and blue dash lines with marks at 5 fs and 10 fs denote the estimated initial 
times for precession and demagnetization, respectively.  
 
The precession of both L and S results from a torque  (T) induced by the laser, which can be 
9 
 
 
 written as TS=dS/dt and TO=dL/dt for spin and orbital, respectively. The direction -dependent 
torque is plotted as a function of time in FIG. 3a. The pulse induces significant large torque for 
in x and y components of SAM, while z-component of OAM and all directions of SAM exhibit 
minimal torque. This observation aligns with the aforementioned results for the pronounced 
magnitudes of Lx and Ly in FIG. 1. The x and y components of torque for both L and S regularly 
oscillate, corresponding to the precession behaviour of L and S. Subsequently,  we further 
calculated time -dependent obliquity dynamics as illustrated in FIG. 3. For L, during early time 
from 0 fs to 8 fs, the obliquity ( θL) of OAM presession exhibits slowly  increase, then from 8 fs 
to 18 fs exponentially enhance to maximum saturate value (around 70◦). The helicity - dependent 
dynamics of the θL can also be clearly seen in FiG. 3b: the enhancement induced by σ+ surpasses 
that induced by σ−. However, the σ+ and σ− only induced  a minute spin obliquity ( θS). FIG. 3c 
demonstrates that  the maximum saturate value of θS is around 0.5◦. Despite σ+ induces a larger 
θS angle than σ−, the θS angle is  two orders of magnitude smaller than θL. Consequently,  θS is 
unlikely to substantially influence the obliquity ( θJ ) of total angular momentum as evident in 
FIG. 3d. Notably, the trends for θJ and θL exhibit remarkably similarity, with  both σ+ induced  θJ 
and θL are larger than  that of σ-. On the other hand, even though the θL is considerable, but the 
magnitude of L is markedly smaller than counterpart of S, leading to a relatively moderate θJ 
value according to vector sum. Overall, the difference between the θL and θJ from two helicities 
is much more pronounced for σ+ pulses as compared to σ− pulses. We found that the initiation 
time for angular momentum precession (beginning at around  5 fs) is evidently earlier than that 
of demagnetization (comencing around 10 fs).   
Next, we will examine how changing the laser param - eters affects the dynamics of 
SAM and OAM. Firstly, if we look at a longer pulse with fwhm = 26.6 fs, the SAM and the 
OAM will have precession in a longer time as shown in Figure 4. In FIG. 1, we can clearly see 
that the frequencies ( ωp) of SAM and OAM precession essentially coincide with the applied 
laser frequency ( flaser) of 395 THz (1.63 eV). Therefore, we will investigate whether the ωp of 
SAM and OAM depend on the flaser. We consider different incide nt flaser, including 66, 197, 395, 
658, 1316 THz, where the fluence and duration of the laser were fixed as shown in FIG. 4. Here, 
 
 Tgm  aid)  dSM  10 
 
 
 the determi - nation of ωp for SAM and OAM is accomplished through Fourier transformation 
of their respective temporal dy - namics. For FIG. 4a, as flaser increases, we can observe that both 
ωp of L and S increase linearly, and the ωp for S and L are almost identical. Employing a linear 
regression analysis, it is established that the precession frequencies for S and L are in direct 
proportion to the incident flaser. 
To further analyse the frequency dependence of SAM and OAM dynamics, we calculated 
the obliquity ( θS and θL) of SAM and OAM within different flaser ranging from 66 Thz , to 1316 
THz (See FIG. 4dc). Our finding show that the higher flaser laser pulse generally leads to a 
notable reduction in θS and θL, while conversely, lower flaser laser pulses tend to yield larger 
values of θS and θL. Notably, for OAM, as the flaser reaches 1316  THz, the θL gradually increases 
from 0◦ to about 10◦, and at this frequency, it can give rise to a θL approaching 90◦. Since the 
flaser is directly proportional to the ωp of SAM and OAM, lower frequency lasers result in  a 
slower ωp, thereby leading to an increase in the precession angle. Such behavior parallels that 
of classical gyroscope precession, where a decrease in precession an - gular frequency lead to 
an increase in precession angle.  consequently, when a sufficiently high flaser laser pulse is 
applied, it drives the precession angle to towards 90◦, resulting in an unstable precession. In the 
case of gyroscope precession, an increase in the precession angle or a decrease in ωp also lead 
to an unstable motion in precession. Regard ing SAM, we similarly observe a substantial 
influence of flaser on the θS. However, unlike the OAM, the SAM only exhibits a small precession  
angle. For example, a high flaser of 1316 THz yield a maximum θS of merely 0.05◦. While a low 
flaser can enhance the θS by approximately 30 -fold, reaching 1.5◦, it still remains  smaller in 
comparison to OAM. Our finding illustrates the flaser can effectively manipulate the precession 
of both SAM and OAM.

respectively. Frequency -dependent precession obliquities for (b) θS , (c) θL are displayed. The 
unstable state in low frequency flaser=66 THz is also indicated in (b). Panels (d) and (e) depict the 
LH and RH precession  of SAM under σ+ and σ− pulses with fwhm=26.6 fs, respectively. Panels (f) 
and (g) illustrate the LH and RH precession of OAM under σ+ and σ− pulses with the same 
parameter, respectively. The color maps indicate the time scale from the start to the end of the 
pulse.  
 
Previous studies have primarily focused on analyzing the dynamics of the z-component of 
angular momentum, regarding them as the primary factors contributing to both demagnetization 
and angular momentum transfer. However, the x and y components of both SAM and OAM, 
which have received comparatively less attention, may exert significant influence over 
magnetization dynamics. Recent theoretical works have showcased distinct spin dynamics in 
magnetic or non -magnetic materials induced by a  circularly polarized l aser pulse; [33,34]  
however, chiral spin precession and oscillated transverse magnetism have not been reported  
to date.  Notably, our findings demonstrate that a circularly polarized laser pulse induces a 
considerably larger component of OAM compared to SAM, signifying a more robust optical 
response from OAM. From Figure S5, we can also see that the OAM has a stronger optica l 
12 
 
 
 response  than the SAM as the amplitude of the pulse changes. These results suggest that the 
angular momentum of a circularly polarized laser may predominantly transfer to the orbital 
component, driving spin precession through the SOC. The dynamics of x and y components of 
SAM and OAM in Co are shown for SOC scaled by factors of  1.5 and 2.0. (See Figure S6) It 
is clear that an increase in SOC leads to an increased SAM but no change in OAM. Moreover, 
it is worth noting that theoretical calculations have repor ted the induction of OAM components 
of electrons through femtosecond laser pulses in Co/Cu(100) interfaces.[3 5, 36] and Pt films [37] 
and metallic cluster [38]. Consequently, the significant generation of OAM components by light 
demonstrates consider - able potential in the emerging field of orbitronics .[23, 25]  
The OISTR effect proposes that light can directly and coherently interact with spin, 
representing the fastest means of controlling spin. This is achieved through light - induced spin -
selective charge excitation within the sublattice of magnetic materials. O ur results demonstrate 
that the time scale of OAM and SAM precession occurs extremely rapidly ( <10 fs), even 
preceding that of the OISTR effect and demagnetization. This is supported by the corresponding 
time scale of the x and y components of SAM and OAM,  as illustrated in Figure 1c -f and Figure 
3. The orientation of SAM and OAM plays a crucial role in comprehending the microscopic 
mechanisms involved in laser -induced demagnetization. Moreover, it’s important to note that 
our simulations were specifically focused on the early spin dynamics, thus limiting the time 
scale to within 100 fs. However, in the time scale of 50 to 100 fs, electron -phonon coupling 
will play a crucial role in influencing the precession of SAM and OAM, leading to a complex 
angular mome ntum transfer involving phonons. Recently, Tauchert et al. [3 9] observed 
circularly polarized phonons or chiral phonons in the demagnetization process due to angular 
momentum transfer from spin systems. The angular momentum transfer between polarized 
phonon and chirality of SAM and OAM dynamics presents an intriguing open question 
warranting further investigation.  
 
In summary, we employed rt -TDDFT simulations to  explore the SAM and OAM dynamics in 
ferromagnetic Fe, Co, and Ni, subjected to circularly σ+ and σ− polarized laser pulses. We 13 
 
 
 unveiled pronounced x and y components for both SAM and OAM, with the OAM components 
exhibiting an order of magnitude larger magnitude than their SAM counterparts. This 
observation emphasizes a more substantial optical response emanating from the electrons’ 
orbital degrees of freedom  in comparison to their spin. Furthermore, we noted a clear 
dependence  of the x and y of component oscillations on the optical helicity. Intriguingly, σ+ and 
σ- pulses were observed to induce distinct chirality  in the precession  of SAM and  OAM: the σ+ 
pulse results in regular LH helical dynamics, while the σ− pulse fosters a RH helical dynamics 
of both SAM and OAM. These chiral precession dynamics  show a strong correlation with the 
laser’s frequency and duration. Our results reveal an exceptionally rapid precession of OAM 
and SAM, outstripping the timescale of the demagnetization process and the OISTR effect. 
Such chirality of spin and orbital dynam ics could be important for the circularly polarized 
phonon in the demagnetization p rocess.
