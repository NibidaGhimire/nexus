We consider two heavy particles immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate in three dimensions
and compute their mutual interaction induced by excitations of the medium. For an ideal Bose
gas, the induced interaction is Newtonian up to a shift in distance which depends on the coupling
strength between impurities and Bosons. For a real BEC, we find that on short distances, the induced
potential is dominated by three-body physics of a single Boson bound to the impurities, leading to an
Efimov potential. At large distances of the order of the healing length, a Yukawa potential emerges
instead. In particular, we find that both regimes are realized for all impurity-boson couplings and
determine the corresponding crossover scales. The transition from the real to the ideal condensate at
low gas parameters is investigated.
I. INTRODUCTION
Interactions between particles in fundamental physics
emerge by local excitations of fields. When the particles
are sufficiently slow, the field’s degrees of freedom can
be integrated out, leading to an effective action-at-a-
distance, which may be described by a distance-dependant
potential. The properties of the induced potential depend
on properties of the field and become highly non-trivial
when the field itself consists of interacting particles.
Recent progress in the creation and control of ultracold
gas systems has enabled experiments where the influence
of such interacting media of particles on impurities can
be studied. In the case where the medium is a Bose-
Einstein condensate (BEC), the impurities are known as
Bose polarons and have been realized experimentally [ 1–4]
and studied in and out of equilibrium [5–15].
A number of theoretical works have studied interactions
induced by a BEC. [ 16] applies Bogoliubov theory to
study how the Efimov hierarchy generated by a single
Boson is modified if a whole condensate is present. In
[17], a variational wave function with a single Bogoliubov
excitation led to a Yukawa potential for weak impurity-
boson (IB) coupling and to an Efimov potential near a
resonance. A perturbative treatment in momentum space
was given in [ 18], a path-integral approach in [ 19]. [20]
investigates the formation of bipolarons. [ 21] discusses the
case of an ideal condensate, including finite temperature.
In [22], general superfluids with a linear dispersion were
considered, which, when applied to a BEC, treats the case
of impurity separations large compared to the healing
length. It was shown that first-order effects in the gas
parameter, which would lead to a Yukawa potential, are
dominated at these scales by second-order effects and a
van-der-Waals potential emerges. [ 23] consider a soft IB
potential while in [ 24,25], the impurities are ionic and
interact via an r−4potential and in [ 26], a spinor BEC is
investigated. Also related are works on 1d condensates
[27–32] and on Fermi polarons [33–37].
In this paper, we consider the experimentally relevant
case of a short (though finite) range potential. We em-
ploy Gross-Pitaevskii theory (GPT) as well as a recently
developed non-local extension (NLGPT, [ 9]) to be able to

The color gradient indicates how well the induced potential
matches the Efimov or Yukawa scaling forms (see Figs. 2,

state is formed, which has an Efimov scaling Eb∼d−2for
d≪ |aIB|where aIBis the impurity-boson scattering length.
At separations comparable to the healing length, the induced

treat large deformations of the condensate. We find that
the Efimov and Yukawa scaling of the induced potential,
previously found at different coupling strengths [ 17], in
fact exist at every coupling but at different impurity sep-
arations as depicted in Fig. 1. For an ideal BEC, on the
other hand, the potential is shown to be Newtonian up to
a shift in distance. Approaching the ideal gas case by a
weakly interacting condensate, we show that the Newto-
nian potential emerges only at very weak gas parameters
of order 10−15in an intermediate distance regime.arXiv:2303.01916v2  [cond-mat.quant-gas]  7 Jun 20232

medium-induced interaction
Vind(d) =Ed−E∞. (2)
A. Basic properties
Before turning to the methods applied to the Hamil-
tonian, let us recall some elementary analytical results,
which serve as a reference.
a. Single-Boson Problem. The three-body problem
of a single Boson and two stationary impurities can be
solved in the case of an IB contact potential. Clearly, the
effective potential formed by the two impurities is the
stronger the closer the impurities are. One finds, that
a bound state exists whenever a−1
IB>−d−1(compared
toa−1
IB>0 for a single impurity) with binding energy of
Eb=κ2/2mBwhere
κ=1
aIB+1
dW0(e−d/aIB) (3)
andW0is the principal branch of the Lambert W function,
i.e. the inverse of wewdefined on [ −1/e,∞) [33,36]. At
short distances or resonant coupling a−1
IB= 0, the binding
energy takes the form Eb∼d−2, which is reminiscent of
Efimov physics and admits a tower of bound states. We
may expect to find the same behaviour at small distances
in the many-body problem [ 38], as a single boson gets
bound to the impurities and repels the other bosons, c.f.
[13].
b. Ideal BEC. In absence of BB interactions, the
ground state of (1)is a product state with all bosons
being in the ground state of the single-boson problem. If
this problem allows for a bound state, the many-body
ground state energy will be −∞as all bosons enter the
bound state and the BEC collapses. Otherwise, all bosons
are in the zero-mode, i.e. the lowest scattering state, and
the ground state energy will be finite [ 12]. It is not zero,however, because in finite volume Ω, the lowest scattering
state has an energy of order 1 /Ω, which, when occupied
Ntimes, does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit.
Again, the problem can be solved explicitly for contact
interactions. Regarding the two impurities as forming
a single effective potential of scattering length aeff, the
ground state energy is given by E= 4πaeffn/2mB(c.f.
[12]). The zero mode ϕ0defines aeffviaϕ0(x)→1−
aeff/|x|as|x| → ∞ . It reads1
ϕ0
x= 1−α
|x−xI,1|−α
|x−xI,2|
where α= 1/(a−1
IB+d−1), so we obtain aeff= 2αand
Ed=8πn/2mB
a−1
IB+d−1.
This formula has already been derived by a different
method in [ 21] and leads to a “shifted Newtonian” induced
attractive potential
Vind(d) =Ed−E∞=−8πa2
IBn
2mB1
aIB+d
whenever aeff<0, i.e. aIB<0 and |aIB|< d(otherwise,
Vind=−∞because a bound state exists which can be
entered by all bosons).
Note that the regions of applicability of the single-boson
analysis vs. the ideal BEC analysis are complementary:
the former requires a bound state to have any effect,
while the latter requires absence of a bound state lest the
BEC collapses. It is for this reaseon that the Newtonian
potential does not reproduce the Efimov effect: it is
applicable only at d >|aIB|, aIB<0, while Efimov scaling
occurs at d <|aIB|.
B. Methods
For the full interacting problem, we employ Gross-
Pitaevskii theory (GPT) as well as its non-local extension
(NLGPT) developed recently in [9].
GPT. If the boson density varies on a length scale
larger than the BB interaction range, a local density
approximation can be applied, and the zero temperature
condensate can be described by a single condensate wave
function ϕ. Using that the ground state energy density
of a BEC is 4 πaBBn2/2mB, this leads to the well-known
Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional
1Indeed, one easily checks that this formula fulfils

Most results of this work are obtained by minimizing this
functional. To justify the local density approximation,
the IB potentials must not be too sharp [ 9]: For instance
for a contact potential, ϕwould have poles 1 /|x−xI,i|
and the BB term would diverge. At a gas parameter of
na3
BB= 10−6, we employ a Gaussian potential VIB(r)∼
exp(−r2/σ2) of range σ= 0.01n−1/3. Since then σ=aBB
is not small compared to aBB, this is, in principle, not soft
enough for GPT to be applicable and indeed, we observe
differences in energy compared to NLGPT with the same
parameters. However, this error is almost constant in d,
such that GPT yields the correct result for the induced
potential (2)for large separations even for this rather
small value of σ.

we have shown in [ 9] how to extend GPT to a non-local
theory by not integrating out the local BB correlations.

mizing ENLGP with the same IB interaction potential VIB
as for GPT to assert the validity of the latter at large
distances as well as to obtain additional results for smaller
distances. Still, we limit ourselves to d≳σwhere the
resulting scaling of Vindis universal.
III. RESULTS
A. Scaling behaviour of the induced potential
Minimizing the GP and NLGP energy functionals at
different impurity separations d, we obtain the induced
potential shown in Fig. 2. It exhibits the following scaling
behaviour:

large distances, the induced potential falls off like a

and two different coupling strengths (more can be found in the
appendix). The circles are the results of the GP simulation
and have a Yukawa scaling at large impurity separation. The
non-local GPT (diamonds) confirms the applicability of GPT
in this regime and remains valid at shorter separations, where
GPT results are off by a factor of about 1.5. Here, the three-
body binding energy Ebis approached, which exhibits Efimov
scaling ∼d−2ford≪ |aIB|.
In GPT, this can be seen as follows: The energy of
a single impurity in a flat BEC is proportional to n.
At large impurity separation, each impurity feels an
almost flat density modulation caused by the other
impurity, so we should have Ed∼n(d) where n(d)
is the density profile of a BEC with one impurity
at zero while n0denotes the unperturbed density.
n(d) is obtained from the zero-energy GPE with
one impurity: At distances larger than the potential
range, it reads (see also [39])

where we have set ϕ(d) =√n0+δϕ(d). This is

2δϕ. The linear approximation in δϕis valid when
δϕis small, which is typically the case for distances
on the order of ξ, except at weak coupling, in which
case distances large compared to aIBare sufficient.
Note that this argument does not require GPT to
be valid close to an impurity, as it is only used
to determine the density profile far away from one
impurity.
It must be noted though that the assumption of
a finite-range impurity-boson potential was crucial
for the derivation: if VIBhas power-law tails, an
additional term 2 mBVIB√nappears in (6). At radii
large compared to ξ, the asymptotic solution is then
δϕ≃ −ξ2mB√nVIB, such that Vind(d)∼VIB(d).
This effect can bee observed in Ref. [ 24] where ions
in a BEC interact via an r−4potential, resulting in
anr−4tail in the induced interaction2. Also, since
the analysis is based on Gross-Pitaevskii theory, only
the leading order in the gas parameter is captured.
At distances large compared to the healing length,
sub-leading terms eventually become dominant as
the Yukawa potential vanishes [22].
(b)Short-distance behaviour: Efimov regime. At small
distances, the induced potential approaches the
three-body binding energy Eb. This indicates that a
single Boson gets bound to the impurity and blocks
the bound state for the others due to its repulsion
as described in [ 13]. When dis small against aIB,
Eband thus also Vindscale like d−2as in the Efimov
effect. At resonance (second panel in Fig. 2), Eb
is directly proportional to d−2even for larger dis-
tances. Nonetheless, we find that the Efimov regime
in the many-body system has a finite range of the
order of the mean particle distance. This is natural
since the picture of one molecule surrounded by a
bath breaks down as the size of the Efimov trimer
increases and extends into the bath [38].
We are not interested here in even shorter ranges of
d < σ , where the scaling of the potential becomes non-
universal and starts to depend on the shape of VIB.
Comparing to the results of [ 17], we thus also find re-
gions of Yukawa and Efimov scaling, but they are not
delimited by the scattering length alone. Instead, we
always find both regimes but for different impurity sep-
arations while the scattering length controls the size of
these regimes. A sketch of this is shown in Fig. 1. The
length scale that delimits the Efimov regime is, for weak
coupling, the scattering length aIB[16], since the three-
body binding energy scales like d−2only for d≪ |aIB|, see
(3). If the impurity separation becomes comparable to the
2The above analysis with the weak-coupling single-impurity en-
ergy E(n) = 4 πaIBn/2mBactually leads to a slightly different

aIBis replaced by its Born approximation.mean boson distance ∼n−1/3, the picture of an individual
boson mediating the interaction no longer applies. Thus,
d≪n−1/3is another condition delimiting the Efimov re-
gion and it becomes the dominant one near the resonance.
The Yukawa regime, on the other hand, starts when the
local density variation δϕfrom the treatment above be-
comes sufficiently small for the linear approximation in
(6)to be applicable. This is the case when dis of the
order of the healing length ξ, or, if 0 <−aIB≪ξ, when
d≫ |aIB|. More quantitatively, we find good agreement
ford⪆ξ/2 ord⪆20|aIB|. The first condition dominates
in the parameter region considered in Fig. 1. In the ap-
pendix, we show results at aIB=−0.01n−1/3exhibiting
a larger Yukawa regime.
We note that when dis large compared to ξ, [22] finds
that the quickly decaying Yukawa potential becomes domi-
nated by second-order effects, which lead to van-der-Waals
scaling.
B. Approach to ideal BEC
In the beginning, we have shown that attractively cou-
pled impurities in an ideal BEC lead to a shifted New-
tonian potential. This matches neither the Efimov nor
the Yukawa potential found for the real BEC, so one
may wonder how the Newtonian regime emerges as an
ideal BEC is approached. In Fig. 3, we solve the GPE
at fixed impurity coupling aIBfor a sequence of BEC gas
parameters na3
BB. As it is lowered, the ideal gas result is
approached in an intermediate distance regime, which is
bounded by |aIB|from below and ξfrom above. However,
the approach is very slow and gas parameters of the order
of 10−15are required for it to be visible. This is a conse-
quence of the slow splitting of length scales in a BEC: the
healing length in units of n−1/3scales with order −1/6 in
the gas parameter, so very small values of the latter are
required to push the Yukawa regime to sufficiently large
distances to make room for an intermediate Newtonian
scaling regime.
IV. CONCLUSION
We have investigated the problem of a force between
particles induced by an interacting Bose-Einstein con-
densed medium by minimizing local and non-local Gross-
Pitaevskii energy functionals. We found that both the
Efimov and Yukawa scaling of the mediated potential can
be observed in certain distance regions with an interme-
diate cross-over regime (Fig. 1). This is in contrast to
previous studies predicting either one or the other de-
pending on the coupling strength. Our result, valid for
impurity separations up to the order of the healing length,
complements a recent study treating separations larger
than the healing length [ 22]. A non-interacting conden-
sate, on the other hand, was shown to induce a shifted
Newtonian potential. The cross-over from interacting to5

non-interacting condensate was found to take place at
low gas parameters of order 10−15, where the Newtonian
behaviour emerges in an intermediate-distance regime.
Experimentally, induced interactions are expected to leadto an energy shift depending on impurity concentration,
which may be probed by radio-frequency spectroscopy [ 1–
4]. To investigate the distance dependence, the impurities
can be confined to individual microtraps [ 24]. For future
work, it will be interesting to investigate the influence
of finite impurity mass in a region where it is still large
compared to the Boson mass, such that the picture of
mediated forces can be applied.
