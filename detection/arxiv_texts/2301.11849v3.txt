Abstract
We study the complexity of computing equilibria in binary public goods ga mes on undi-
rected graphs. In such a game, players correspond to vertices in a graph and face a binary
choice of performing an action, or not. Each player’s decision depen ds only on the number
of neighbors in the graph who perform the action and is encoded by a per-player binary
pattern. We show that games with decreasing patterns (where pla yers only want to act up
to a thresholdnumber ofadjacentplayersdoingso) alwayshavea p ure Nashequilibrium and
that one is reached from any starting proﬁle by following a polynomially bounded sequence
of best responses. For non-monotonic patterns of the form 10k10∗(where players want to
act alone or alongside k+1 neighbors), we show that it is NP-hard to decide whether a pure
Nash equilibrium exists. We further investigate a generalization of th e model that permits
ties of varying strength: an edge with integral weight wbehaves as wparallel edges. While,
in this model, a pure Nash equilibrium still exists for decreasing patter s, we show that the
task of computing one is PLS-complete.
1 Introduction
Public goods are resources that can be freely accessed and simultaneousl y used by many in-
dividuals. In the physical world, they comprise abundant na tural resources like sunlight and
breathable air alongside artiﬁcial goods such as cultural h eritage, public art, or early warning
systems. Public goods have become ubiquitous in the informa tion age, when data can be re-
produced at a negligible cost, yet remains valuable to its us ers. Examples from this domain
are open source software, public databases, radio transmis sions, and the diﬀusion of scientiﬁc
knowledge through open channels. However, not all public go ods are universal: a population
warning system proﬁts a region, herd immunity to a virus is en joyed on the basis of human con-
tact, and a scientiﬁc manuscript may be legible only to a grou p of peers. For these scenarios,
the possibility of access may be represented by a graph, wher e a vertex can only enjoy goods
that are provided by itself or by one of its neighbors. In the c lassical setting of Bramoull´ e and
Kranton [2], each vertex may produce any amount of a ﬁxed good and experiences utility based
on the total amount of the good that is available in the closed neighborhood, minus a cost
associated with local production. In the public goods game , vertices aim to conﬁgure their own
production to maximize the resulting utility. Whether such strategic decisions allow for a stable
arrangement and, if so, how one can be found and proposed to th e actors are natural questions
for policy makers. Bramoull´ e and Kranton show for strictly concave beneﬁts and linear costs
the existence of specialized equilibria , in which the production of each vertex is either zero or
a ﬁxed, positive amount. This motivates the study of a binary variant of the game, wherein
vertices have only two options: to be activeand produce (one unit of) the good, or to remain
inactive [7, 8, 10, 15, 16]. In general, costs and utility fun ctions can be deﬁned in a way that
allows vertices to be indiﬀerent to this choice. Yang and Wang [15] use this to show that it

isNP-hard to decide whether an equilibrium exists, already for a monotone beneﬁt function
common to all agents. In response, Maiti and Dey [10] introdu ce—and Gilboa and Nisan [7]
shift the focus towards—restricted games in which every ver texialways has a strict preference
with respect to its options. As this preference depends only on the number of active neighbors,
we may encode it by an inﬁnite, indexed-from-zero binary seq uenceTi, called a best response
pattern[7], where Ti
ℓis the activity response of ito exactly ℓactive neighbors. When there is a
single pattern common to each vertex, this is called the fully homogeneous case [16], otherwise
we call the game inhomogeneous.
1.1 Our results
We investigate the computational hardness of deciding whet her a game admits a pure Nash
equilibrium, for two natural classes of patterns for which t his question was unresolved [7].
Decreasing patterns are those that start with a positive num ber of ones and are zero there-
after. We show that for this class, even the inhomogeneous bi nary public goods game is equiv-
alent to a congestion game. We use this equivalence to show th at best-response dynamics
converge to a pure Nash equilibrium in polynomial time. For a n extension of the game in which
edges have an integral weight, however, we show that ﬁnding a n equilibrium is PLS-complete.
We call a picky pattern one where Tℓ= 1 if and only if ℓ∈ {0,k+1}, for some k≥1. Here,
vertices wish to act only alone or alongside k+1 neighbors. For example, when k= 1 for every
vertex, then theGraphinducedby theactive vertices of aneq uilibriumconsists of singletons and
cycles. We show that deciding the existence of such an equili brium is an NP-complete problem,
even in the fully homogeneous case. A notable corollary is th e following: While deciding the
inﬁnite alternating sequence T= (1,0,1,0,...) is inP[13], any truncation of this sequence in
which it is zero after alternating at least two times corresp onds to a hard problem.
Table 1 shows a summaryof our results for homogeneous patter ns alongside previous results.
1.2 Related work
LetG= (V,E) be an undirected graph and denote the open neighborhood of vertex i∈Vby
N(i):={j∈V:{i,j} ∈E}. Bramoull´ e and Kranton [2] study a model where each vertex i s
a player whose strategy is to pick a production eﬀort si∈Si:=R≥0. For a strategy vector
s= (s1,...,sn), the utility of each player is given by ui(s):=b(si+/summationtext
j∈N(i)sj)−csi, where
b:R≥0→R≥0is a beneﬁt function with b(0) = 0, b′>0 andb′′<0, and where c >0 denotes
the cost of production. The authors show the existence of a pa rticular kind of Nash equilibrium,
2swithsi∈ {0,(b′)−1(c)}, that they call a specialized equilibrium . They translate this result
also to the more general case where biandcidepend on the player i. Pandit and Kulkarni [12]
discuss the eﬃciency of specialized equilibria and give con ditions under which they attain the
maximum social welfare, maximum production eﬀort, and minim um cost achieved by a general
Nash equilibrium.
Yu et al. [16] study a binary variant of the game with Si:={0,1}and where they allow for
arbitrary non-decreasing and player-speciﬁc bi, and for player-speciﬁc ci. They aim to show that
in this setting, deciding the existence of a pure Nash equili brium is an NP-complete problem.
Yang and Wang [15] point out a ﬂaw in the proof and provide a cor rected version. They further
extend this result to homogeneous games where all functions biand all parameters ciare equal.
As noted by Gilboa and Nisan [7], the hardness result of Yang a nd Wang hinges on the fact
that some players are indiﬀerent to their binary decisions, i .e.,b(k+ 1)−b(k) =cfor some
value ofk. Gilboa and Nisan exclude this possibility by studying best-response patterns . These
are binary sequences that explicitly give the best response of a player ibased on the number
of neighbors j∈N(i) withsj= 1. The authors settle the complexity for a number of pattern s,
including some that start with 0, for which they consider non-trivial equilibria . They also show
that hard patterns that start with 1 remain hard when they are preﬁxed with (1 ,0). See Table 1
for previous results on patterns starting with 1. In indepen dent and concurrent work, Gilboa [6]
gives an alternative proof of Theorem 5.11 and settles the co mplexity of all remaining ﬁnite (i.e.,
T∈.∗0+) and non-monotone patterns, which complements our results on monotone patterns
to a full characterization of the ﬁnite and homogeneous case . Maiti and Dey [10] provide a
parametrized complexity perspective wherein they study na tural graph parameters such as the
maximum degree and the treewidth.
L´ opez-Pintado [9] initiates the study of public goods game s on directed graphs. The author
analyzes a restricted binary model where each agent iprefers to play si= 1 if and only if none
of their in-neighbors jplayssj= 1. Papadimitriou and Peng [13] perform a complexity analys is
of the binary variant on directed graphs for more general uti lity functions. They investigate in
particular the setting where all players share a utility fun ction that is monotone in the number
of in-neighbors jwho play sj= 1. This allows for a pattern-wise analysis akin to that of Gi lboa
and Nisan [7]. Here the authors provide a complete character ization by showing that only
the trivial all-zero and all-ones patterns as well as the inﬁ nite alternating sequence starting
with 1 are polynomial-time decidable. They further provide aPPAD-hardness result for the
computation of approximate mixed Nash equilibria.
Kempe et al. [8] are interested in modifying the graph in such a way that one element of
a given set of strategy vectors is a pure Nash equilibrium of t he binary game. The motivation
behind this is to enforce a socially preferable equilibrium through the intervention of a policy
maker. Finally, Galeotti et al. [4] study a variant of the gam e where players have only partial
knowledge of the network structure.
2 Preliminaries
Forn∈Z≥1we write [ n] short for {1,...,n}. For a set A, we write 1Afor the indicator function
ofA, that is1A(x):= 1, ifx∈A, and1A(x):= 0, ifx/\e}atio\slash∈A. For an undirected and simple graph
G= (V,E), we write ∆( G) for its maximum vertex degree, deg( v) for the degree of v∈V,
G[X] for the subgraph induced by X⊆V,NG(v) for the open neighborhood of v∈V, and
NG(X):={v∈V\X| ∃x∈X:{v,x} ∈E}for the open neighborhood of X⊆V. We drop
suﬃxes when the graph in question is clear.
Whens∈ {0,1}nwithn=|V|denotes a strategy proﬁle of the binary public goods game
played on G= (V,E) with best-response pattern T, then we say that a vertex v∈Visactive
(ins), ifsv= 1, and inactive, ifsv= 0. We further write degs(v):=|{u∈NG(v)|su= 1}|
and call this the active degree ofv. Finally, we say that a vertex v∈Visbest-responding (in s)
3ifsv=Tdegs(v).
2.1 Response pattern notation
We use regular expressions (REs) over the alphabet A:={0,1}to describe classes of best
response patterns. We ﬁrst deﬁne their syntax: Every c∈Aand the dot .are RE. If eandf
are REs, then so are the concatenation ef, thek-fold concatenation of ewith itself, ( e)k, the
zero-or-more operation ( e)∗, and the one-or-more operation ( e)+. Parentheses may be omitted:
superscripts then take precedence over concatenation, for example 10∗= 1(0)∗/\e}atio\slash= (10)∗.
The language L(e) generated by an RE eis the following: For the dot we have L(.):=
{(a)|a∈A}. Forc∈A, it isL(c):={(c)}. For REs eandf, it isL(ef):=L(e)×L(f),
L(ek):=L(e)k,L(e+):=/uniontext∞
i=1L(e)iandL(e∗):=L(e+)∪{()}, where () is the empty sequence
overAand where ( c) =cis a sequence of length one.
Extensible REs end in ( e)∗or (e)+for some sub-expression e. For the set of best response
patterns P(e) generated by an extensible RE e, we have ( x)∞
i=1∈P(e) if and only if there
is a threshold Nsuch that ( x)n
i=1∈L(e) for all n≥N. For example, P(1∗0+) =P(1∗00∗)
contains all inﬁnite sequences that start with a nonnegativ e, ﬁnite number of ones and are zero
thereafter, while P(1∗0∗) contains in addition the inﬁnite sequence of ones. In the fo llowing, we
writeT∈eshort for T∈P(e). We also write T=einstead of T∈eto signify that |P(e)|= 1.
2.2 Best-response games, strategic games, and consistent r epresentations
In the following we make explicit the relation between the bi nary public goods game that
is speciﬁed by the players’ best-response behaviors and the classical deﬁnition where players
associate a utility value with their two choices. This work a dopts the former representation as
abest-response game that captures precisely the strict[10] public goods games on graphs. To
still leverage established notions of game equivalence tha t are based on utility functions, we
introduce the notion of a consistent representation of a best-response game as a strategic game
in which players experience utility. We start the introduct ion of these concepts with the class
of best-response games:
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Best-response game) .A best-response game (BRG) is described by a triple
(n,(Si)n
i=1,(βi)n
i=1) where nis the number of players, Siis the strategy set of player i∈[n],
andβi:/producttexti−1
j=1Sj×/producttextn
j=i+1Sj→Siis a function such that βi(s−i) denotes the best response of
playerigiven that the other players play s−i.
For a strategy proﬁle s∈/producttextn
j=1Sjandi∈[n], we write s−ishort for/producttexti−1
j=1{sj}×/producttextn
j=i+1{sj}
and we call sapure Nash equilibrium (PNE) if βi(s−i) =sifor alli∈[n].
It is straightforward to formalize the binary public goods g ame as a BRG.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Binary public goods game) .For an undirected simple graph G= (V,E) with
nvertices V= [n] and for best-response patterns Ti= (τi
ℓ)∞
ℓ=0for alli∈V, we call the
best-response game ( n,({0,1})n
i=1,(βi)n
i=1) withβi(s−i):=Ti
xi(s−i)andxi(s−i):=/summationtext
j∈NG(i)sj
a (binary) public goods game (PGG). We also refer to just Gand theTias a PGG.
IfTi=Tfor alli∈Vand for some pattern T, then we refer to the associated PGG as a
homogeneous PGG with pattern T.
While in a best-response game a player’s response is deﬁned u niquely, in strategic games
players choose a strategy among all that maximize a utility f unction:
Deﬁnition 2.3 (Strategic game) .A strategic game is a triple ( n,(Si)n
i=1,(ui)n
i=1) wherenis
the number of players, Siis the strategy set of player i∈[n], andui:/producttextn
j=1Sj→Qis a
function such that ui(s) denotes the utility experienced by player i∈[n] when the strategy
proﬁles∈/producttextn
j=1Sjis played.
4For a strategy proﬁle s∈/producttextn
j=1Sj,i∈[n], anda∈Si, we write ( s−i,a) short for/producttexti−1
j=1{sj}×
{a}×/producttextn
j=i+1{sj}. We call a strategy proﬁle s∈/producttextn
j=1Sjwithui(s)≥ui(s−i,a) for alli∈[n]
and alla∈Siapure Nash equilibrium (PNE).
With a suitedutility function, wecan represent any BRG as as trategic game withequivalent
best-response dynamics (cf. [10]):
Deﬁnition 2.4 (Consistent representation) .LetA= (n,(Si)n
i=1,(βi)n
i=1) be a BRG. We call a
strategic game B= (n,(Si)n
i=1,(ui)n
i=1) aconsistent representation ofAif for all s∈/producttextn
j=1Sj
and alli∈[n], it isui(s−i,a)> ui(s−i,a′) for all a′∈Si\{a}wherea:=βi(s−i) is the best
response of iinA.
Consistent representations are closely related to the noti on of aweak isomorphism between
strategic games [3]. In particular, they also preserve the s tructure of pure Nash equilibria:
Lemma 2.5. LetA= (n,(Si)n
i=1,(βi)n
i=1)be a BRG and B= (n,(Si)n
i=1,(ui)n
i=1)a consistent
representation of A. Then,s∈/producttextn
j=1Sjis a PNE of Aif and only if sis a PNE of B.
Proof.Let ﬁrst sbe a PNE of Aand consider a player i∈[n] ofAand their best response
a:=βi(s−i). SinceAis a PNE, it is a=si. As further B is a consistent representation,
ui(s) =ui(s−i,si) =ui(s−i,a)> ui(s−i,a′)
for alla′∈Si\{a}. Thus,ui(s)≥ui(s−i,a′′) for alla′′∈Si, sosis a PNE of B.
Let next sbe a PNE of Band consider a player i∈[n] ofBplayinga:=si. Assume towards
a contradiction that si/\e}atio\slash=βi(s−i) =:b. SinceBis a PNE, ui(s−i,a) =ui(s)≥ui(s−i,a′) for all
a′∈Si. Fromb∈Si, it follows in particular that ui(s−i,a)≥ui(s−i,b). AsBis a consistent
representation and a/\e}atio\slash=b,ui(s−i,b)> ui(s−i,a), a contradiction. Hence, si=βi(s−i), sosis a
PNE ofA.
We are further interested in the dynamics that may lead to a PN E:
Deﬁnition 2.6 (Better-response sequence) .For a best-response game ( n,(Si)n
i=1,(βi)n
i=1), a
better-response sequence is a sequence of strategy proﬁles (si)N
i=1such that for all i∈[N−1],
it issi+1= (si
−j,a) for some j∈[n] anda∈Sjwithβj(si
−j) =aanda/\e}atio\slash=si
j.
For astrategic game ( n,(Si)n
i=1,(ui)n
i=1), a better-responsesequenceis asequenceof strategy
proﬁles ( si)N
i=1such that for all i∈[N−1], it issi+1= (si
−j,a) for some j∈[n] anda∈Sj
such that uj(si
−j,a)> uj(si).
It is immediate from Deﬁnition 2.4 that consistent represen tations preserve better-response
sequences:
Lemma 2.7. IfAis a BRG and Ba consistent representation of A, then any better-response
sequence in Ais also a better-response sequence in B.
Note that the converse does not hold: While the better respon se of a player in a best-
response game is unique, there may be multiple unilateral st rategy changes that improve the
utility of the deviating player in a strategic game.
2.3 Game isomorphisms
We will make use of the following notion of equivalence of str ategic games:
Deﬁnition 2.8 (Strong isomorphism [3]) .Two strategic games A= (n,(Si)n
i=1,(ui)n
i=1) and
B=/parenleftbig
n,(S′
i)n
i=1,(u′
i)n
i=1/parenrightbig
are called (strongly) isomorphic when there are bijections π: [n]→[n]
andφi:Si→S′
π(i)for alli∈[n] such that for all players i∈[n] (ofA) and strategy proﬁles
s∈/producttextn
j=1Sj, it isui(s) =u′
π(i)(φ(s)) where φ(s):=/parenleftbig
φπ−1(j)(sπ−1(j))/parenrightbign
j=1.
5Note that for π= id[n], it isφ(s) = (φj(sj))n
j=1. Informally, an isomorphism describes a
one-to-one mapping between the players and strategy proﬁle s of two games that preserves the
players’ utility and, by extension, the players’ strategy p references and the PNE structure of
both games. In particular:
Lemma 2.9. If two games AandBare isomorphic and Aadmits a PNE, then so does B.
Proof.IfA= (n,(Si)n
i=1,(ui)n
i=1) has a PNE s∈/producttextn
i=1Si, thenui(t)≤ui(s) for alli∈[n] and
t∈/producttextn
j=1Sj. AsAandBare isomorphic, there exist bijections πandφsuch that
u′
π(i)(φ(t)) =ui(t)≤ui(s) =u′
π(i)(φ(s))
for alliandtas above. As both πandφare surjective, s′is a PNE of B.
2.4 Encoding
ForthehomogeneousPGG,weassumeinlinewithpreviouswork thatthecommonbestresponse
pattern is part of the problem deﬁnition and not of the proble m input. For the inhomogeneous
variant, this approach is not adequate as each player might h ave a distinct pattern, so here we
assume that the patterns are part of the input and give the enc oding explicitly.
3 Existence of equilibria for decreasing patterns
Decreasing best-response patterns are those that begin wit h a positive number of ones and are
zero thereafter. They arise naturally in scenarios where pu blic goods have a constant cost to
produce and provide diminishing returns (to the producer an d its neighbors alike), expressed
through a concave utility function. We show that for this fam ily of patterns, formally P(1+0+),
the public goods game is equivalent to a congestion game :
Deﬁnition 3.1 (Congestion game) .LetEbe a set of goods equipped with a delay function
de:Z≥1→Qfor every e∈E. Then, we call a strategic game ( n,(Si)n
i=1,(ui)n
i=1) withSi⊆E
andui(s) =−/summationtext
e∈side(xs(e)) withxs(e):=/summationtextn
j=11sj(e) for alli∈[n] a congestion game.
More precisely, we show equivalence in the following sense:
Proposition 3.2. The binary public goods game on undirected graphs with best-r esponse pat-
ternsTi∈1+0+,i∈V, has a consistent representation that is isomorphic to a con gestion
game.
In the proof we construct a congestion game as follows: Every edge and every vertex of the
public goods game G= (V,E) is represented by a congestible good in the congestion game C.
A player i∈Vremaining inactive in Gis represented by the associated player i∈[n] choosing
the singleton strategy {i}inC, which has a constant cost just below the number of ones in the
player’s pattern, ki. The alternative strategy of iinCcorresponds to ibeing active in Gand
amounts to selecting the set of all edges incident to iinG. The cost of this strategy in Cis the
number of edges that are used by both players who have the edge in their strategy. The idea
is that players will strictly prefer the “edge” strategy as l ong as less than kiof its neighbors do
so, and the “vertex” strategy otherwise.
Proof of Proposition 3.2. LetG= (V,E) be an instance of the PGG with patterns Ti= 1ki0∗,
ki≥1, for all i∈V= [n]. Deﬁne the strategic game Γ := (n,(Si)n

We ﬁrst show that Γ is a consistent representation of G. Lets∈ {0,1}nbe a strategy proﬁle
andi∈Va player of G. Let further a:=βi(s−i) be the best response of ianda′:= 1−aits

This observation allows us to state the main theorem of this s ection, which answers the ﬁrst
out of two open questions in [7]:
Theorem 3.3. The binary public goods game on undirected graphs with best-r esponse patterns
Ti∈1+0+,i∈V, always admits a PNE; the associated decision problem is thu s inP.
Proof.As every congestion game has a PNE [14], the claim follows fro m Lemma 2.9 and Propo-
sition 3.2.
Additionally, the representation as a congestion game brin gs with it convergence guarantees:
Corollary 3.4. In the game of Theorem 3.3, best-response dynamics converge to a PNE after

Proof.Letkmax:= max i∈Vki. Any vertex can have at most ∆( G) active neighbors, so the game
forkmax>∆(G)+1is equivalent to theonefor kmax= ∆(G)+1. Let thus kmax≤∆(G)+1≤n,
without loss of generality.

which has decreasing potential.
4 Hardness of decreasing patterns with weighted edges
We next investigate a natural extension of the publicgoods g ame, in which ties can have varying
importance:

(V,E) withnvertices V= [n], edge weights we∈Z≥1for alle∈E, and best-response

j∈NG(i)w{i,j}sjan (edge-)weighted binary public goods
game.
We ﬁrst notice that a straightforward adaptation of the proo f of Proposition 3.2 yields that
also games with weighted edges are isomorphic to a congestio n game:
Proposition 4.2. The weighted binary public goods game on undirected graphs wi th best-
response patterns Ti∈1+0+,i∈V, has a consistent representation that is isomorphic to
a congestion game.
8Proof (Sketch). We use the same construction as in the proof of Proposition 3. 2 except that the
utilities in the deﬁnition of Γ (Eq. (1)) are given by ui(s):=−xi(s−1) forsi= 1 and the delay
functions are deﬁned as de(x):=we(x−1) for all e∈E.
In Corollary 3.4, we have shown that best-responsedynamics converge in polynomial time to
aPNEforunweighted binarypublicgoods games. Incontrast, weshowthat for weighted games,
the computation of a PNE is PLS-complete. For the proof, we use a straightforward reductio n
from the problem of computing a pure Nash equilibrium in a thr eshold game, a particular kind
of congestion game where each player has two strategies only . (Not to be confused with another
“threshold game” introduced in [13], where players pick the ir strategy from the unit interval.)
The only non-trivial part in the reduction is the fact that in a threshold game, a player may
be indiﬀerent between their two strategies, while in a weight ed binary public goods game this
cannot occur. Intuitively, the absence of indiﬀerence makes the computation of equilibria for
public goods games only harder. For the proof, we formalize t his intuition.
Theorem 4.3. Computing a pure Nash equilibrium of a weighted binary public goods game on
an undirected graph with patterns Ti∈1+0+for alli∈[n]isPLS-complete when patterns are
encoded through the number of leading ones as a binary number .
Proof.We ﬁrst sketch membership in PLS: Feasible solutions of a weighted binary public goods
game arestrategy proﬁles, encodedas binaryvectors of size n. Theirvaluemay bedeﬁnedasthe
potentialvalueofthecongestiongamethatisisomorphicto thegame’sconsistentrepresentation,
which can be computed in polynomial time. As an initial solut ion one may choose an all-zero
vector; the neighborhood of a solution is just the ﬂip-neigh borhood of size n.
Ackermann et al. [1, Theorem 4.1] have shown that the computa tion of a pure Nash equilib-
rium for a threshold game is PLS-complete. A threshold game is a congestion game where the
set of goods Eis partitioned into two disjoint sets EinandEout. The set Eout:={ei|i∈[n]}
contains a good eifor every player i. The set Eincontains a good ei,jfor every unordered pair
of players {i,j} ⊆[n] withi/\e}atio\slash=j. The delay function of the goods ei∈Eoutis constant, i.e., for
every player ithere is a constant θi∈R>0such that dei(x) =θifor allx∈Z≥1. As explained
in [1, Remark 4.2], the proof of [1, Theorem 4.1] only uses del ay functions of the form
dei,j(x) =ai,j(x−1) for all {i,j} ⊆[n] withi/\e}atio\slash=j, whereai,j>0. (2)
A closer examination of the proof further reveals that the va luesai,jcan in fact be chosen to
be integer. Thus, the PLS-completeness also holds for this special case. The set of st rategies of
each player iis given by Si={sout
i,sin
i}withsout
i={ei}andsin
i={ei,j|j∈[n],j/\e}atio\slash=i}.
For the reduction, let an instance of a threshold game with th e delay functions as in (2)
be given. We construct a corresponding instance of a weighte d binary public goods game as
follows. The game is played on a complete graph G= (V,E) with edge weights we=ai,j∈Z≥1
for alle={i,j} ∈E. We further set Ti:= 1⌊θi⌋0∗for alli∈[n]. Letsbe a pure Nash
equilibrium of the thus deﬁned weighted binary public goods game. We claim that ¯ sdeﬁned
for alli∈[n] as ¯si=sout
i, ifsi= 0, and ¯ si=sin
i, ifsi= 1, is a pure Nash equilibrium of the
threshold game. By the deﬁnition of ¯ sand the fact that sis a pure Nash equilibrium of the
weighted binary public goods game, we have ¯ si=sout
iwhenever xi(s−i)≥ ⌊θi⌋+1 and ¯si=sin
i
whenever xi(s−i)≤ ⌊θi⌋. A player iwith ¯si=sout
ihas utility −θi. After a deviation to sin
i, the
utility would be −xi(s−i)≤ −(⌊θi⌋+1)≤ −θi, so that this deviation is not proﬁtable. On the
other hand, a player iwith ¯si=sin
ihas utility −xi(s−i). After a deviation to sout
i, the utility
would be −θi≤ −⌊θi⌋ ≤ −xi(s−i), so that also this deviation is not proﬁtable. This conclud es
thePLS-reduction.
95 Hardness of the picky pattern
In a picky pattern, players want to perform the action if eith er none or a particular number of
neighbors also does so, formally T= 10k10∗withk≥1. We deﬁne a number of graph gadgets
thatareusedinapolynomial-timereductionfromthe NP-hard[5]POSITIVE-1IN3-SAT problem:

withli

a set of boolean variables and where ⊥denotes unconditional falsity. The problem is to decide

.
A closely related problem was also used in a reduction to a bin ary public goods game in [7].
In the reduction, the literals of a POSITIVE-1IN3-SAT instance (either non-negated variables
or falsity) are represented by literal vertices and truth assignments to the underlying boolean
variables are encoded by these vertices’ strategies. The ga dgets represent logical operators and
connect the literal vertices in such a way that the resulting graph admits a PNE if and only if
thePOSITIVE-1IN3-SAT formula is satisﬁable. To this end, every gadget has a set of operand
verticesthat are identiﬁed with a subset of the literal vertices; no o ther gadget vertex has an
edge leaving the gadget. We refer to gadget vertices that are adjacent to the operator vertices
asmembrane vertices . Three out of four gadgets are constructed in such a way that m embrane
vertices are inactive in any PNE on a graph containing the gad get. We call this property safety
as it rules out potential side eﬀects when the gadget is added t o a graph. In particular, this
ensures that adding a gadget to a graph that admits no PNE will not allow a PNE to exist in
the resulting graph:
Lemma 5.2. LetG◦= (V◦,E◦)be a graph gadget with operand vertices X⊆V◦and membrane
verticesM:=NG◦(X)such that for all graphs G′= (V′,E′)withV′∩V◦=X, for all PNE s
on(V′∪V◦,E′∪E◦), and for all m∈M, it issm= 0. Let further G= (V,E)be a ﬁxed graph
withV∩V◦=Xthat admits no PNE. Then, also H= (V∪V◦,E∪E◦)admits no PNE.
Proof.LetG◦,X,M,G, andHas in the lemma and assume towards a contradiction that
Hadmits a PNE s. Consider the strategy proﬁle tobtained by limiting sto vertices in G. If
degt(v) = degs(v)forallv∈V, thensisaPNEon G, sothereisa v∈Vwithdegt(v)/\e}atio\slash= degs(v).
IfNH(v)⊆V, then degt(v) = degs(v) by construction of t, so there is further a u∈NH(v)\V
withsu= 1. Since u/\e}atio\slash∈V,{u,v} /\e}atio\slash∈E, so{u,v} ∈E◦, implying u,v∈V◦. Fromv∈Vit
follows that v∈Xand from u∈NH(v) it follows that u∈NG◦(v) and thus u∈NG◦(X) =M,
contradicting su= 1.
5.1 The NEAR-OR gadget
TheNEAR-OR gadget (Fig. 1) is used to ensure (under the assumption that a PNE exists) that at
least one literal in each clause of a POSITIVE-1IN3-SAT instance evaluates to true. The “near”
in its name stems from the fact that, when used to represent an ℓ-ary logical operator with
ℓ > k, the gadget cannot distinguish between a total of 0 or k+1 operands evaluating to true;
in both cases the gadget will prevent a PNE. The gadget furthe r appears as a building block in
other gadgets, where we make use of this property. We call the NEAR-OR gadget for ℓ= 1 the
TRUEgadget as it forces its single operand vertex to be active in a ny PNE.
The following lemma implies that the NEAR-OR gadget forbids a PNE in which none of its
operand vertices are active.
Lemma 5.3. TheNEAR-OR gadget with operand vertices removed admits no PNE.

Proof for k= 1.LetGbe the graph of Fig. 1a without the vertices in Xand assume towards a
contradiction that Gadmits a PNE s. Assume further that degs(v)≥4 for some v∈V. Then,
vis a vertex with deg( v) = 4 and vis inactive in s. Consider {u,v} ∈Ewith deg( u) = 2. Then,
uis active with degs(u) = 1 as N(u) ={v,v′} ∈E, contradicting that sis a PNE. We have
thus degs(v)≤3 for all v∈V. In particular, v∈Vis active if and only if degs(v) is even. Let
nextA⊆Vactive and I=V\Ainactive. Since/summationtext
a∈Adegs(a)+/summationtext

a∈Adeg(a)
is even, also |I|and by extension |A|= 6− |I|are even. The cases of |A| ∈ {0,6}are easily
ruled out, so either |A|= 2 or|I|= 2. If A={a1,a2} ∈E, degs(a1) = 1 contradicts a1
active. If A={a1,a2} /\e}atio\slash∈E, diam(G) = 2 implies an i∈IwithA⊆N(i) so that degs(i) = 2
contradicts iinactive. If I={i1,i2} ∈E, thenG[A] is either the paw graph or the union of a
P3and a singleton. Both have a vertex of degree one, implying a∈Awith degs(a) = 1, which
contradicts abeing active. Finally, if I={i1,i2} /\e}atio\slash∈E, then degs(i1) = deg(i1)∈ {2,4}. As we
ruled out degs(i1) = 4 earlier, this contradicts i1inactive.
Proof for k≥2.LetGbe the graph of Fig. 1b without the vertices in Xand assume towards
a contradiction that Gadmits a PNE s. If both yandzare inactive, then wand all vertices
inYand inZhave no active neighbors and are active. This contradicts ybeing inactive,
as degs(y) =|Y|+ 1 =k+ 1. If both yandzare active, then degs(v)∈ {1,2}for allvin
{w}∪Y∪Z, soall vertices other than yandzare inactive. Thus, degs(y) = 1, which contradicts
ybeing active. If exactly one of yandzis active, say y, then all vertices in Yare inactive and
all inZare active. If further wis inactive, then degs(z) =k+1 contradicts zbeing inactive.
If however wis active, then degs(y) = 1 contradicts ybeing active.
The next lemma states that the NEAR-OR gadget also forbids a PNE in which exactly k+1
of its operand vertices are active.
Lemma 5.4. LetG∨= (V∨,E∨)an instance of the NEAR-OR gadget,G= (V,E)a graph
withV∩V∨={xi|i∈[ℓ]}, andH:= (V∪V∨,E∪E∨). Then, Hadmits no PNE swith/summationtextℓ
i=1sxi=k+1.
Proof for k= 1.Assume towards a contradiction that sis a PNE of Hwith/summationtextℓ
i=1sxi=k+1.
Ifwis active, then both yandzare inactive as otherwise degs(w)> k+ 1. If further qis
inactive, then both y′andz′are active as degs(y′) = degs(z′) = 0. This contradicts qinactive,
as degs(q) = 2, so qis active. If y′is inactive, then degs(y) = 2 contradicts yinactive. So y′
11must be active, contradicting degs(y′) = 1. If wis inactive, then degs(w)> k+ 1, soyorz
or both are active. If both yandzare active, then exactly one of y′andqmust be active,
otherwise degs(y)∈ {1,3}. Ifqis active, degs(y′) = 2 contradicts y′inactive. If y′is active, this
contradicts degs(y′) = 1. Thus, exactly one of yandzis active, say y. Since degs(y)∈ {0,2}
withzandwboth inactive, it follows that y′andqare either both active or both inactive.
If both are active, this contradicts zinactive as then degs(z) = 2. If both are inactive, it is
degs(z′) = 0, so z′is active. This again implies degs(z) = 2, contradicting zinactive.
Proof for k≥2.Assume towards a contradiction that sis a PNE of Hwith/summationtextℓ
i=1sxi=k+1.
Analogous to the proof for k= 1, we have that either wis active and both yandzare inactive,
or thatwis inactive and at least one of yandzis active. In the former case, all vertices in Y
have no active neighbors and are active, contradicting yinactive as degs(y) =|Y|+1 =k+1.
In the latter case, if both yandzare active, then all vertices in Yare inactive, contradicting
yactive as degs(y) = 1. If only zis active, then all vertices in Yare active, contradicting y
inactive as again degs(y) =|Y|+1. A symmetric argument rules out that only yis active.
Next, we show that the NEAR-OR gadget permits a PNE in every other case.
Lemma 5.5. LetG∨= (V∨,E∨)an instance of the NEAR-OR gadget,G= (V,E)a graph with
V∩V∨=X, andH:= (V∪V∨,E∪E∨). Then, if Gadmits a PNE swith/summationtextℓ
i=1sxi/\e}atio\slash∈ {0,k+1},
then also Hadmits a PNE twithtv=svfor allv∈V.
Proof for k= 1.We claim that twith
tv:=

sv,ifv∈V,
1,ifv∈ {q},
0,ifv∈V∨\(X∪{q}).
is a PNE on H. Sincetv=svand, due to tw= 0, also degt(v) = degs(v) holds for all v∈V
by construction, it remains to show that vertices in ( V∪V∨)\V=V∨\Xare best-responding.
This is the case as degt(q) = 0 and qis active, degt(w) =m/\e}atio\slash∈ {0,k+1}andwis inactive, and
for allv∈ {y,z,y′,z′}, degt(v) = 1 and vis inactive.
Proof for k≥2.LetQ:=Y∪Z. We claim that twith
tv:=

sv,ifv∈V,
1,ifv∈Q,
0,ifv∈V∨\(X∪Q).
is a PNE on H. Again, we only need to show that vertices in V∨\Xare best-responding. This
is the case as for all q∈Q, degt(q) = 0 and qis active, degt(w) =m/\e}atio\slash∈ {0,k+ 1}andwis
inactive, and degt(y) = degt(z) =kandyandzare both inactive.
Additionally, we argue that the NEAR-OR gadget is safe.
Lemma 5.6. LetG∨= (V∨,E∨)an instance of the NEAR-OR gadget,G= (V,E)a graph with
V∩V∨=X, andH:= (V∪V∨,E∪E∨). Then, Hadmits no PNE in which w, the unique
vertex in NG∨(X), is active.
Proof for k= 1.Lettbe a PNE of Hand assume towards a contradiction that tw= 1. By
Lemmas 5.3 and 5.4,/summationtextℓ
i=1txi=:m/\e}atio\slash∈ {0,k+1}. Sincewis active and degt(w)≥m >0, it is
degt(w) =k+1 = 2. Therefor, at least one of yandzmust beactive, as otherwise degt(w) =m.
If bothyandzare active, then neither y′norqcan be active as otherwise degs(y)>2. An
analogous argument rules out that z′is active. This implies deg( q) = 2, contradicting qinactive.

Thus, exactly oneof yandzis active, say y. Iffurther qis active, also y′is active as degs(y′) = 2
but this contradicts yactive as then degs(y) = 3. So qis inactive, implying that z′is active
due to degs(z′) = 0. If further y′is inactive, then degs(q) = 2 contradicts qinactive, so also y′
is active, contradicting degs(y′) = 1.
Proof for k≥2.Lettbe a PNE of Hand assume towards a contradiction that tw= 1. By
analogy with the proof for k= 1, we have degt(w) =k+1> mso that at least one of yandz
must be active. If yis active, then degt(y′) = 1 for all y′∈Y, so all vertices in Yare inactive
and degt(y)∈ {1,2}. Since 2 < k+1, this contradicts yactive. An analogous argument rules
out that zis active.
Finally, we summarize the behavior of the NEAR-OR gadget.
Corollary 5.7. LetG∨= (V∨,E∨)an instance of the NEAR-OR gadget,G= (V,E)a graph with
V∩V∨=X, andH:= (V∪V∨,E∪E∨). Then:
1.NEAR-OR is permissive: If Gadmits a PNE swith/summationtext
x∈Xsx/\e}atio\slash∈ {0,k+ 1}, then also H
admits a PNE twithtv=svfor allv∈V.
2.NEAR-OR is restrictive: If Hadmits a PNE t, then/summationtext
x∈Xtx/\e}atio\slash∈ {0,k+1}.
3.NEAR-OR is safe: In any PNE tonHand for all m∈NG∨(x),tm= 0.
Proof.Permissiveness was shown in Lemma 5.5, restrictiveness is t he sum of Lemmas 5.3
and 5.4, and safety follows from Lemma 5.6.
5.2 The FALSEgadget
In aPOSITIVE-1IN3-SAT instance, literals are either non-negated boolean variabl es or falsity
(⊥). To represent the latter, we introduce a gadget that forces a vertex to be inactive in any
PNE (Fig. 2a).
Lemma 5.8. LetG⊥= (V⊥,E⊥)an instance of the FALSEgadget,G= (V,E)a graph with
V∩V⊥={x}, andH:= (V∪V⊥,E∪E⊥). Then:
1.FALSEis permissive: If Gadmits a PNE swithsx= 0, then also Hadmits a PNE twith
tv=svfor allv∈V.
2.FALSEis restrictive: If Hadmits a PNE t, thentx= 0.
133.FALSEis safe: In any PNE tonHand for all m∈NG⊥(x),tm= 0.
Proof. Permissiveness. LetGadmit a PNE swithsx= 0. Then, the partial strategy proﬁle p
withpv=sv, for allv∈V, andpyi= 1, for all i∈[k], can be extended to a PNE for Hby the
permissiveness of the NEAR-OR gadget.
Restrictiveness. Assume towards a contradiction that Hadmits a PNE twithtx= 1.
SinceTRUEis restrictive, tyi= 1 for all i∈[k]. This contradicts NEAR-OR being restrictive, as
tx+/summationtextk
i=1tyi=k+1.
Safety.Follows from the safety of the NEAR-OR gadget as xis identiﬁed with an operand
vertex of the ( k+1)-ary NEAR-OR gadget in G⊥.
5.3 The EQUIVgadget
Next, we introduce a gadget to identify equal variables in di stinct clauses (Fig. 2b).
Lemma 5.9. LetG↔= (V↔,E↔)an instance of the EQUIVgadget,G= (V,E)a graph with
V∩V↔={x1,x2}, andH:= (V∪V↔,E∪E↔). Then:
1.EQUIVis permissive: If Gadmits a PNE swithsx1=sx2, then also Hadmits a PNE t
withtv=svfor allv∈V.
2.EQUIVis restrictive: If Hadmits a PNE t, thentx1=tx2.
3.EQUIVis safe: In any PNE tonHand for all m∈NG⊥({x1,x2}),tm= 0.
Proof. Permissiveness. LetGadmit a PNE swithsx1=sx2. We ﬁrst show that the strategy
proﬁlepwith
pv:=

sv,ifv∈V,
0,ifv=y,
1,ifv∈ {zi|i∈[k]},
is a PNE in the graph G′that is obtained by removing all vertices in V↔\/parenleftbig
{x1,x2,y}∪{zi|
i∈[k]}/parenrightbig
fromH. Sincepy= 0, allv∈Vare best-responding in p, so it remains to show that
alsoyandzifori∈[k] are best-responding. This is the case as for all i∈[k], degp(zi) = 0 and
ziis active, while degp(y)∈ {k,k+ 2}withk≥1 andyis inactive. Since pis a PNE on G′,
it follows from the permissiveness of the TRUEandFALSEgadgets that also Hadmits a PNE t
withtv=pv=svfor allv∈V.
Restrictiveness. Assume towards a contradiction that Hadmits a PNE twithtx1/\e}atio\slash=tx2.
Without loss of generality let tx1= 1 and tx2= 0. By the restrictiveness of the TRUEandFALSE
gadgets, ty= 0 and tzi= 1 for all i∈[k]. Thus, degt(y) =k+1, contradicting yinactive.
Safety.ItisNG⊥({x1,x2}) ={y}and, in any PNE tonH,ty= 0 asFALSEis restrictive.
5.4 The CLAUSEgadget
Finally, we represent each clause of a POSITIVE-1IN3-SAT instance by a CLAUSEgadget (Fig. 3).
Here, we do not require the familiar trio of properties. Inst ead, the gadget is designed to admit
three symmetric PNE, each of which has one distinct vertex fr om{t1,t2,t3}in active state. We
prove a slightly weaker claim, which is suﬃcient for the redu ction.
Lemma 5.10. LetGbe an instance of the CLAUSEgadget. Then,
•for every t∈ {t1,t2,t3},Gadmits a PNE swithst= 1, and
•in any PNE sonG,st1+st2+st3= 1.

(a) ANEAR-OR gadget whose operand vertices t1,t2, andt3are pairwise connected by three
parallel paths with one inner vertex each. (b) A triangle wit h the same operand vertex labels.
Proof.The case of k≥2 is trivial: Exactly the proﬁles in which exactly one of the t hree vertices
is active are PNE. Let thus k= 1 in the following.
We show the ﬁrst claim only for t=t2as the other cases are analogous. We claim that the
partial strategy proﬁle swith
sv:=/braceleftBigg
1,ifv∈ {t2, z1,z2,z3},
0,ifv∈ {t1,t3, x1,x2,x3, y1,y2,y3},
can be extended to a PNE on G. We ﬁrst argue that sis a PNE on the graph obtained
by removing all non-operand vertices of the NEAR-OR gadget from G. On this graph it is
degs(t2) = 0 and t2is active while degs(t1) = degs(t3) = 3 and both t1andt3are inactive.
Further, degs(z) = 0 and zis active for every z∈ {z1,z2,z3}while degs(v) = 1 and vis inactive
for allv∈ {x1,x2,x3, y1,y2,y3}. Sincet1+t2+t3= 1/\e}atio\slash∈ {0,k+1}, it follows from Lemma 5.5
thatscan be extended to a PNE on G.
Next, let sbeany PNE on Gand assumetowards a contradiction that ℓ:=st1+st2+st3/\e}atio\slash= 1.
The cases of ℓ= 0 and ℓ= 3 are ruled out by the restrictiveness of the NEAR-OR gadget, so it
remains to rule out ℓ= 2. Without loss of generality let st1=st2= 1 and st3= 0; the other
cases are analogous. Then, degs(xi) = 2 and xiis active for all i∈[3]. Thus, degs(t1)≥3,
contradicting t1active.
5.5 Reduction
With our assortment of gadgets, we can prove the main result o f this section, which answers
the second open question posed in [7]:
Theorem 5.11. The homogeneous binary public goods game equilibrium decisi on problem on
undirected graphs with best-response pattern T∈10+10∗isNP-complete.
Proof.Containment in NPis obvious. For NP-hardness, we describe a polynomial-time re-
duction from POSITIVE-1IN3-SAT . In the following, we consider the best-response pattern
T= 10k10∗for a ﬁxed k≥1. To ease notation, we write s(v) instead of svto denote the
strategy of a vertex vin a strategy proﬁle s.
LetI:=/braceleftbig
{li

withli
j∈X∪ {⊥}for all (i,j)∈[ℓ]×[3],ℓ∈Z≥1, and
X={ξ1,...,ξm}a set of boolean variables, be an instance of POSITIVE-1IN3-SAT . Recall that
Iis ayes-instance if and only if the formula

is satisﬁable. We construct an instance G= (V,E) of the binary public goods game that
has a PNE if and only if this is the case. Starting from the empt y graph, we introduce a
15disjointCLAUSEgadgetCi= (Vi,Ei) for every {li
1,li
2,li
3} ∈I, whose vertices we relabel with a
superscript i. We call the resulting graph G′. Note that for some i/\e}atio\slash=i′∈[ℓ] andj,j′∈[3], it
may be the case that li
j=li′
j′∈Xwhileti
j/\e}atio\slash=ti′
j′are disjoint vertices. For every such quadruple
(i,j,i′,j′), we add an EQUIVgadget on fresh non-operand vertices whose operand vertice s are
identiﬁed with ti
jandti′
j′. We call the graph at this point G′′. Next, for every ( i,j)∈[ℓ]×[3]
withli
j=⊥, we add a FALSEgadget on fresh non-operand vertices whose operand vertex w e
identify with ti
j. This yields the graph G. Clearly, the number of vertices added is polynomial
in the number of clauses ℓ, so that this construction can be accomplished in time polyn omial in
the size of I. In the following we show decision equivalence.
Let ﬁrst Ibe ayes-instance. Then, there is a truth assignment σ:X→ {0,1}satisfying Φ.
We claim that the partial strategy assignment s0with
s0(ti
j):=/braceleftBigg
σ(ξ),ifli
j=ξ∈X,
0,ifli
j=⊥,
for all (i,j)∈[ℓ]×[3] can be extended to a PNE on G. To this end consider ﬁrst the CLAUSE
gadgets and the associated subgraph G′ofG. Since Φ is satisﬁed, we have s0(ti
1) +s0(ti
2) +
s0(ti
3) = 1 for every i∈[ℓ]. By Lemma 5.10, it follows that G′admits a PNE s′withs′(ti
j) =
s0(ti
j) for all ( i,j)∈[ℓ]×[3]. Consider next the EQUIVgadgets and the associated subgraph
G′′ofG. Letti
jandti′
j′be the operand vertices of an EQUIVgadget. Then, li
j=li′
j′∈Xby
construction so that s′(ti
j) =s0(ti
j) =s0(ti′
j′) =s′(ti′
j′) by deﬁnition of s′ands0. From the
permissiveness of the EQUIVgadgets (applied iteratively), it follows that G′′admits a PNE
s′′withs′′(ti
j) =s′(ti
j) =s0(ti
j) for all ( i,j)∈[ℓ]×[3]. Consider next the FALSEgadgets in
G. Letti
jbe the operand vertex of such a gadget. Then, by construction ,li
j=⊥and thus
s′′(ti
j) =s0(ti
j) = 0. By the permissiveness of the FALSEgadgets (applied iteratively), we have
thatGadmits a PNE as required.
Let next Gadmit a PNE s. We show that the truth assignment σ:X→ {0,1}given by
σ(li
j):=s(ti
j) for all ( i,j)∈[ℓ]×[3] withli
j∈Xsatisﬁes Φ. First, we show that σis well-deﬁned.
To this end assume towards a contradiction that there are ( i,j)/\e}atio\slash= (i′,j′)∈[ℓ]×[3] such that
li
j=li′
j′buts(ti
j)/\e}atio\slash=s(ti′
j′). By construction, there is an EQUIVgadget in Gwith operand vertices
ti
jandti′
j′, whose restrictiveness contradicts sbeing a PNE. Next, we show that Φ is satisﬁed.
Leti∈[ℓ] index a clause {li
1,li
2,li
3} ∈Iand consider the associated CLAUSEgadgetCiwith
operand vertices Vi={ti
1,ti
2,ti
3}. SinceEQUIVandFALSEare safe gadgets, implying s(v) = 0
for allv∈NG(Vi), it follows that slimited to Viis a PNE on G. By Lemma 5.10, this implies
s(ti
1)+s(ti
2)+s(ti
3) = 1. Without loss of generality, assume that s(ti
1) = 1 and s(ti
2) =s(ti
3) = 0.
We establish that li
1∈X. To this end assume towards a contradiction that li
1=⊥. Then, by
construction, there is a FALSEgadget in Gwhoseoperand vertex is ti
1. SinceFALSEis restrictive,
s(ti
1) = 1 contradicts sbeing a PNE. Since li
1∈X, we have σ(li
1) =s(ti
1) = 1, so/parenleftbig
li
1∨li
2∨li
3/parenrightbig
is satisﬁed by σ. It remains to show that both li
2andli
3arefalseunderσ. We do so for li
2; the
argument for li
3is analogous. The case of li
2=⊥is clear, so let li
2∈X. Then,σ(li
2) =s(ti
2) = 0.
It follows that also ¬/parenleftbig

and, by extension, Φ is satisﬁed by σ.
In [7] it was shown that any NP-hard pattern starting with a 1 remains NP-hard when it is
preﬁxed with the sequence 10. This lets us identify another n atural family of patterns that is
NP-hard to decide, that of all truncated alternating sequences:
Corollary 5.12. The homogeneous binary public goods game equilibrium decisi on problem on
undirected graphs with best-response pattern T∈(10)+10∗isNP-complete.
What makes this family interesting is that its “limit case”, the alternating sequence T=
(10)∗, is polynomial-time decidable already for the more general case of directed graphs [13].
166 Conclusions
We studied equilibria of the binary public goods game from th e perspective of computational
complexity. We have resolved two open questions posed by Gil boa and Nisan [7] that concern
the best-response patterns 1k0∗fork≥3 and 10k10∗fork≥1. For the former family, we
discovered a connection to congestion games, which guarant ees the existence of equilibria and
yields a straightforward polynomial time algorithm to comp ute one: any sequence of better
responses will converge to an equilibrium after at most O(n2) steps. While this holds already
for the inhomogeneous case where each player may follow a diﬀe rent pattern from this family,
the problem becomes PLS-complete when we consider in addition links of varying stre ngth. For
the latter family of patterns, we proved that it is NP-hard to decide whether an equilibrium
exists. The special case of 1010∗together with a result in [7] shows that the family of truncat ed
alternating patterns, (10)+10∗, also induces a hard problem. This complements nicely a posi tive
result for (10)∗given in [13]. In concert with concurrent work by Gilboa [6], these results settle
the computational complexity of computing equilibria for t he homogeneous binary public goods
game on general undirected graphs when players share a ﬁnite best-response pattern.
