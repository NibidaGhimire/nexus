ABSTRACT
Context. Thanks to more than 20 years of monitoring, the radial velocity (RV) method has detected long-period companions (P >
10yr) around several dozens of stars. Yet, the true nature of these companions remains unclear because of the uncertainty as to the
inclination of the companion orbital plane.
Aims. We wish to constrain the orbital inclination and the true mass of long-period single companions.
Methods. We used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Ô¨Åtting algorithm to combine RV measurements with absolute astrometry
and, when available, relative astrometry data.
Results. We have lifted the sin( i) indetermination for seven long-period companions. We Ô¨Ånd true masses in the planetary mass range
for the candidate planets detected in the following systems: Epsilon Indi A, HD 13931, HD 115954, and HD 222155. The mass of
HD 219077 b is close to the deuterium-burning limit and its nature is uncertain because of the imprecise mass of the host star. Using
additional RV measurements, we reÔ¨Åne the orbital parameters of HIP 70849 b and Ô¨Ånd a mass in the planetary range. By combining
RV data with absolute and relative astrometry, we signiÔ¨Åcantly improve the characterization of HD 211847 B and properly determine
its mass, which appears to be in the low-mass star range. This work illustrates how Gaia and Hipparcos allow for the orbital properties
and masses of long-period RV companions to be further constrained.

1. Introduction
In the last decade, several long-period giant planets have been
detected using the radial velocity (hereafter RV) method thanks
to the increasing temporal baselines of di erent surveys (Mayor
et al. (2011), Wittenmyer et al. (2020), Rosenthal et al. (2021)).
Yet, a precise determination of the orbital parameters and mass
of the planets is very di cult when the orbital period is much
larger than the RV time baseline. As a consequence, the radial
distribution of planets beyond 8-10 au ‚Äì such as those found by
Fernandes et al. (2019) and Fulton et al. (2021) based on the
results of the two long RV surveys of Mayor et al. (2011) and
Rosenthal et al. (2021), respectively ‚Äì are questionable. This
unfortunately prevents an accurate comparison with formation
model outputs from being made.
Combining RV data with other methods such as relative or
absolute astrometry can, in principle, improve the orbital charac-
terization of these companions. Furthermore, it can also remove
the uncertainty of the orbital inclination and then allow us to de-
termine the true mass of the planets.
Coupling RV data with relative astrometry from direct imag-
ing (hereafter DI) or interferometry has been, however, limited
to very few cases since high-contrast imaging (hereafter HCI)
or interferometry observations favor young systems to minimize
the Ô¨Çux contrast between the star and its companion while RV
?Please send any requests to Ô¨Çorian.philipot@obspm.frobservations favor old and inactive stars which produce low RV
jitters. However, when possible, such a coupling is very e cient.
An illustration is the HD 7449 system for which the outer com-
panion was Ô¨Årst reported as a planet candidate using only RV
data (Mayor et al. (2011), Wittenmyer et al. (2019)), and it was
then identiÔ¨Åed as a low-mass star by combining RV data with
HCI observations (Rodigas et al. 2016).
In the 2000s, the combination of RV data and absolute
astrometry, thanks to the Fine-Guidance-Sensor onboard the
Hubble Space Telescope, also allowed for the inclination of
a few stellar systems to be constrained and a few candidate
planets to be conÔ¨Årmed (Benedict et al. (2002), Benedict et al.
(2006)), while others were Ô¨Ånally identiÔ¨Åed as brown dwarfs
or low-mass stars (Bean et al. (2007); Benedict et al. (2010)).
Today, the position and proper motion measurements obtained
with the telescopes Hipparcos (Perryman et al. (1997), van
Leeuwen (2007)) and Gaia (Gaia Collaboration 2020) allow us
to combine the RV data and more precise absolute astrometry
for a large number of systems. Since the publication of the Ô¨Årst
Gaia data release (DR1), a few studies have proven the e ciency
of combining RV data with absolute and /or relative astrometry
to improve the constraints on the orbital parameters and mass
of a companion (Grandjean et al. (2019), Brandt et al. (2019),
Damasso et al. (2020), Lagrange et al. (2020), Nielsen et al.
(2020), Venner et al. (2021), Brandt et al. (2021a), Brandt et al.

(2021b), Kiefer et al. (2021), Li et al. (2021), Feng et al. (2022)).
In this paper, we focus on seven long-period single com-
panions detected by the RV method, and combine the available
RV data with Hipparcos and Gaia early data release 3 (hereafter
EDR3) absolute astrometry and, when available, relative astrom-
etry, to improve the orbital parameters and determine the true
mass of these companions. In Section 2, we describe our target
selection method and present the RV , HCI, and astrometric data
used in our study. Section 3 presents the method used to per-
form the orbital Ô¨Åtting and, there, we provide the new orbital
parameters and mass found for each target. Finally, we discuss
the results in Section 4.
2. Target selection and data
2.1. Target selection
We Ô¨Årst selected the planetary systems in the exoplanet.eu cat-
alog (Schneider et al. 2011) for which a single companion has
been reported with a semi-major axis greater than 5 au using the
RV method. Twenty-Ô¨Åve companions were found with such cri-
teria. For nine of them (HD 13724 B, HD 25015 b, HD 181234
b, and HD 219828 B (Feng et al. 2022); HD 92987 B (Venner
et al. 2021); HIP 36985 B (Biller et al. 2022); and HD 98649 b,
HD 196067 b, and HD 221420 B (Li et al. 2021)), the orbital
parameters and the true mass have already been properly deter-
mined in previous studies. We, therefore, do not consider them
in the present study.
We Ô¨Årst discarded the HD 95872 system because no Hip-
parcos data were available. We then discarded four systems for
which the available RV time series did not cover both extrema
of the RV variations and the orbital period could not be prop-
erly determined (HD 26161, HD 120066, HD 150706, and HD
213472). In those four cases, the combination of RV and abso-
lute astrometry did not allow us to constrain the orbital param-
eters, the orbital inclination, or the true mass of the companion.
Finally, we discarded four systems for which the orbital period
was well covered by the RV data, but the coupling with absolute
astrometry did not allow us to constrain the orbital inclination
(HD 136925, HD 190984, HD 220773, and HD 238914). Indeed,
the variations in position and acceleration of the proper motion
of these stars were too small to constrain the orbital inclination
of the companion due to the low mass of the companion ( <2
MJup) and/or the distance of the system.
Thus, we were left with seven systems for which the addi-
tion of absolute astrometry and /or new RV measurements and /or
relative astrometry measurements allowed us to determine the
exact nature of the companion: Epsilon Indi Ab, HD 13931, HD
1159554, HD 211847, HD 219077, HD 222155, and HIP 70849.
For three of these companions (Epsilon Indi Ab, HD 211847 B,
and HD 219077 b), a Ô¨Årst estimation of their orbital inclination
and true mass has been obtained by combining RV data and ab-
solute astrometry. Yet, thanks to additional data or more precise
astrometric measurements, we obtained more precise and sig-
niÔ¨Åcantly di erent results from those reported in the previous
studies for six of these companions. In the case of HD 219077 b,
the di erences were mainly found for the mass of the compan-
ion. They are mainly due to the uncertainties as to the host star‚Äôs
mass.2.2. RV data
The RV data used in this study were obtained with di erent spec-
trographs between 1997 and 2021. The HARPS (Mayor et al.
2003) data were taken from the ESO archives; the ELODIE
(Baranne et al. 1996) and SOPHIE (Perruchot et al. 2008)
data were retrieved from the OHP archives; and the CORALIE
(Queloz et al. 1999), the HIRES (V ogt et al. 1994), the UVES
(Dekker et al. 2000), the AAT (Diego et al. 1990), the CES
(Enard 1982) long camera (LC), and the CES very long camera
(VLC) data were taken from the literature.
As instrument upgrades can lead to new RV o sets, the same
instrument before and after a major upgrade is considered as two
dierent instruments. Consequently, HARPS data obtained be-
fore and after the optical Ô¨Åber upgrade in 2015 (Lo Curto et al.
2015) are referred to as H03 and H15, respectively. The SO-
PHIE data obtained before and after the spectrograph upgrade in
2011 (Bouchy et al. 2013) are referred to as SOPHIE and SO-
PHIE +, respectively. The HIRES data obtained before and af-
ter the upgrade of the spectrograph in 2004 (Tal-Or et al. 2019)
are referred to as Hir94 and Hir04, respectively. Finally, the
CORALIE spectrograph had two major upgrades in 2007 (S√©-
gransan et al. 2010) and in 2014. The data obtained before 2007
and after 2014 are referred to as C98 and C14, respectively, and
the data obtained between 2007 and 2014 are referred to as C07.
2.3. Direct imaging data
In three cases, HCI data are available in the SPHERE archive
and can provide relative astrometry. The three targets were ob-
served in angular (and spectral) di erential imaging (A(S)DI,
Marois et al. (2006)) using the telescope in pupil tracking mode.
The standard observing mode of SPHERE was used, with IRDIS
(Dohlen et al. 2008) dual band images at H2 and H3 (K1 and
K2, respectively) and IFS (Claudi et al. 2008) data covering the
YJ (YJH, respectively) bands. The observing log is given in Ta-
ble.1. Whenever possible, the robust PACO A(S)DI algorithm
(Flasseur et al. (2020a), Flasseur et al. (2020b)) was used. The
processing step takes advantage of the developments made to the
COBREX data center pipeline (the prereduction improvement as
well as the improvement of the detection capability of PACO). If
a dataset did not su ciently cover the Ô¨Åeld-of-view rotation to
apply ADI-based algorithms, the SPECAL (Galicher et al. 2018)
No-ADI algorithm was used.
In those three systems, only one companion was detected
(HD 211847 B). The detected companion is characterized in Ta-
ble.2. No detection above 5 was found around HD 219077. Six
sources were detected around HIP 70849 but, given their posi-
tion in a color-magnitude diagram and their separations, they are
likely background sources.
2.4. Absolute astrometry
We used measurements from Hipparcos obtained around epoch
1991.25 and from Gaia EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. (2016),
Gaia Collaboration et al. (2021)) obtained around epoch 2016.0.
For each target, the stellar acceleration was determined from the
proper motion and the position values were measured by Hip-
parcos and Gaia with an interval of about 25 years. We con-
sidered the proper motion values published by Brandt (2021) in
the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA). More-
over, a more accurate tangential proper motion ( Hip EDR 3) was
estimated by the di erence between the position measurements
obtained by Hipparcos and Gaia divided by the time interval be-

3. Updated orbital parameters and mass
3.1. Orbit Ô¨Åtting
Orbits were Ô¨Åtted using a custom MCMC tool, based on the em-
cee 3.0 python package (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). It uses
a mixture of move functions (such as the di erential evolution
move function) to alleviate potential multimodality issues. The
Hipparcos /Gaia data processing uses the HTOF package (Brandt
et al. 2021) and borrows large sections of the orvara code (Brandt
et al. 2021) for the likelihood computation. The HTOF package
(Brandt et al. 2021) was used to Ô¨Åt the intermediate astrometric
data (IAD) from Hipparcos, based on the 1997 (Esa 1997) and
2007 (van Leeuwen 2007) reductions and from Gaia, thanks to
the Gaia Observation Forecast Tool (GOST) which allowed us
to obtain the estimated Gaia observations and scan angles for
each target, in order to reproduce proper motion and position of
each observation. Using the Hipparcos and Gaia positions and
the temporal baseline, the algorithm derived a tangential proper
motion value that allowed us to better constrain the orbital Ô¨Åt
when combined with RV data.
We considered ten free parameters for each system: the semi-
major axis ( a), the eccentricity, the orbital inclination ( i), the host
star mass, the companion mass, the longitude of ascending node
(
), the argument of periastron ( !), the phase, a stellar jitter, and
the distance of the system. In addition, to combine data from
dierent instruments, we added an instrumental o set for each
instrument as a free parameter of the model (see above). Finally,
we considered uniform priors for all Ô¨Åtting parameters, except
for the host star mass and the distance of the system for which
we considered Gaussian priors.
3.2. Results
3.2.1. Epsilon Indi A
Epsilon Indi is a triple system with a 0 :760:04 M , K2V star
(Epsilon Indi A) and a binary composed of a 75 :00:8 M Jup,
T1.5 brown dwarf (Epsilon Indi B) and a 70 :10:7 M Jup, T6
brown dwarf (Epsilon Indi C) separated by about 2.6 au (Di-
eterich et al. 2018). The projected separation between the binary
brown dwarfs and the star is about 1460 au. Combining RV dataand absolute astrometry based on Hipparcos and the Gaia data
release 2 (DR2) measurements, Feng et al. (2019) reported a gi-
ant planet with a semi-major axis of 11 :55+0:98
 0:86au, a mass of
3:25+0:39
 0:65MJup, an inclination of 64 :25+13:80
 6:09¬∞, and an eccentric-
ity of 0:26+0:07
 0:03. Yet, the Gaia EDR3 proper motion and posi-
tion measurements are signiÔ¨Åcantly more precise compared to
the Gaia DR2 measurement and they signiÔ¨Åcantly improve the
characterization of Epsilon Indi Ab.
We used 4278 RV measurements obtained with the HARPS
spectrograph between 2003 and 20161, 163 RV measurements
obtained with the UVES spectrograph between 1996 and 2017,
72 RV measurements obtained with the LC spectrograph be-
tween 1992 and 1997, and 53 RV measurements obtained with
the VLC spectrograph between 2000 and 2006. We also com-
bined these RV data with absolute astrometry based on Hippar-
cos and the Gaia EDR3 measurements (Fig.1). We found sig-
niÔ¨Åcantly di erent orbital parameters with a semi-major axis of
8:8+0:2
 0:1au, a mass of 3 :00:1 M Jup, an inclination of 91+4
 5¬∞, and
an eccentricity of 0 :480:01. It is important to note that if we
consider only the 539 HARPS RV data with a signal-to-noise
ratio greater than 110 and thus remove the high cadence obser-
vations made in August 2011, we Ô¨Ånd similar solutions.
3.2.2. HD 13931
HD 13931 is a 1 :020:05 M (Rosenthal et al. 2021), G0V
star. Based on 66 RV measurements obtained with the HIRES
spectrograph between 1998 and 2019, Rosenthal et al. (2021)
reported a giant planet with a semi-major axis of 5 :3230:091
au, a minimum mass of 1 :911+0:077
 0:076MJup, and an eccentricity of
0:02+0:021
 0:014.
We combined these RV data with absolute astrometry
(Fig.2). As the RV baseline is much larger than the orbital pe-
riod, the orbital parameters are well-constrained. As expected,
we found a semi-major axis and an eccentricity very close to
those reported by Rosenthal et al. (2021) with a=5:330:09
au and e <0.04. Using, in addition, the absolute astrometry, we
found an orbital inclination of either 39+13
 8¬∞ or 141+9
 18¬∞ and a true
mass of 3:1+0:8
 0:7MJup.
3.2.3. HD 115954
HD 115954 is a 1 :180:06 M , G0V star (Demangeon et al.
2021). Based on four RV measurements obtained with the
ELODIE spectrograph between 2004 and 2005 and 45 RV mea-
surements obtained with the SOPHIE spectrograph between
2009 and 2018, Demangeon et al. (2021) reported a giant planet
1The 3636 RV data obtained between Julian days 2455790 and
2455805 were obtained to study high-frequency oscillations of the star.
These data were measured with high cadence, which led to a signiÔ¨Å-
cantly lower signal-to-noise ratio compared to the other data.

3.2.4. HD 211847
HD 211847 is a 0 :940:04 M , G5V star (Sahlmann et al. 2011).
Sahlmann et al. (2011) reported a brown dwarf candidate orbit-
ing around HD 211847 based on 31 RV measurements obtained
with the CORALIE spectrograph between 2002 and 2009. How-
ever, only one minimum of the HD 211847 B RV curve was
covered by the dataset. Thus, the orbital parameters and min-
imum mass reported in this study are poorly constrained. Us-

ing the Levenberg-Marquardt method, they found ranges corre-
sponding to a 3 conÔ¨Ådence interval for the semi-major axis,
the eccentricity, and the minimum mass of 4.6‚Äì42 au, 0.48‚Äì0.95,
and 16.3‚Äì24.3 M Jup, respectively. Moutou et al. (2017) obtained
one HCI detection with SPHERE of HD 211847 B for a pro-
jected separation of 11.3 au. Using the BT-Settl models (Allard
2014), they Ô¨Åt the HD 211847 B spectrum and found a low stel-
lar mass of 155 9 M Jupassuming an age of 3 Gyr for the host
star. Based on the result of Sahlmann et al. (2011), Moutou et al.
(2017) estimated the inclination of the companion orbit to be
around seven¬∞. Recently, combining the CORALIE RV measure-
ment and the absolute astrometry, Feng et al. (2022) reported HD
211847 B as a brown dwarf with a semi-major axis of 4 :514+0:458

We combined the RV dataset used by Sahlmann et al. (2011),
the relative astrometry observation obtained with SPHERE in
June 2015, and the absolute astrometry (Fig.4). Adding one rel-
ative astrometry observation allowed us to properly constrain the
orbital parameters and the mass of HD211847 B with results sig-
niÔ¨Åcantly di erent from those reported by Feng et al. (2022). We
found a semi-major axis of 6 :780:08 au and an eccentricity of
0:59+0:01
 0:02. Using, in addition, the absolute astrometry, we found
an orbital inclination of 172 :3+0:05
 0:04¬∞ and a true mass of 148 5
MJup. We note that by taking only RV data and absolute astrom-
etry into account, we found very poorly constrained solutions
with large uncertainties as to the semi-major axis (16 - 30 au)
and mass (80 - 140 M Jup). Moreover, the solutions found are not
in agreement with those reported by Feng et al. (2022) or with
the solutions found when adding the HCI data.

3.2.5. HD 219077
Based on 63 CORALIE RV measurements obtained between
1999 and 2012 and 30 HARPS RV measurements obtained be-
tween 2003 and 2012, Marmier et al. (2013) reported a very ec-
centric giant planet with a semi-major axis of 6 :220:09 au
and a minimum mass of 10 :390:09 M Jup. It is important to
note that the RV data used by Marmier et al. (2013) are not pub-
licly available. Based on 72 pieces of RV data obtained with the
AAT spectrograph between 1998 and 2015, Kane et al. (2019)
reported slightly di erent properties for HD 219077 with a semi-
major axis of 7 :03+0:20
 0:21au and a minimum mass of 13 :40+0:76
 0:78MJup. These di erences are probably due to the di erent assump-
tions on the mass of the star. Indeed, Marmier et al. (2013) used
the values reported by Hipparcos (M ?=1:050:02 M ) while
Kane et al. (2019) used the values reported in Valenti & Fischer
(2005) (M ?=1:510:13 M ). Recently, Feng et al. (2022) com-
bined the AAT RV measurements used by Kane et al. (2019)
and 33 HARPS RV measurements obtained between 2003 and
2012 with the absolute astrometry based on Hipparcos and the
Gaia EDR3 measurements and found a semi-major axis close to
Marmier et al. (2013), an orbital inclination of 90 :178+9:527
 9:462¬∞, and
a true mass of 9 :620+1:001
 0:733MJup. The prior on the mass of the star
is not given.
For this study, as the data used by Marmier et al. (2013)
are not available, we considered the HARPS and AAT RV mea-
surements used on Feng et al. (2022) and the 65 CORALIE RV
measurements available on the DACE archive2obtained between
1999 and 20123. For the mass of the star, we considered the value
given by Kervella et al. (2022) based on the Gaia DR3 results
(M?=1:150:06 M ). We combined the RV data with the ab-
solute astrometry (Fig.5). We found a semi-major axis and an
eccentricity close to those reported in the previous studies with
a=6:40:1 au and e =0:7690:002 and an orbital inclination
close to that of Feng et al. (2022) with either i=833¬∞ or i=
973¬∞. Considering the star mass found by Kervella et al. (2022),
we found a planetary mass at 11 :30:4 M Jup. However, consid-
ering that the mass used in Valenti & Fischer (2005) would lead
to a mass close to the deuterium-burning limit, Mb=13:60:5
MJup. Due to the uncertainties on the mass of the host star, it is
not possible to determine the exact nature of HD 219077 b.
3.2.6. HD 222155
HD 222155 is a 1 :130:11 M , G2V star (Boisse et al. 2012).
Based on 44 RV measurements obtained with the ELODIE spec-
trograph between 1997 and 2005 and 67 RV measurements ob-
tained with the SOPHIE spectrograph between 2007 and 2011,
Boisse et al. (2012) reported a giant planet with a semi-major
axis of 5:1+0:6
 0:7au, a minimum mass of 1 :90+0:67
 0:53MJup, and an
eccentricity of 0 :38+0:28
 0:32.
We considered 31 additional pieces of SOPHIE RV data ob-
tained between 2011 and 2016. We combined the RV data with
the absolute astrometry (Fig.6). We found orbital parameters
within the error bars associated with the values found by Boisse
et al. (2012) with a=4:70:1 au and e =0:340:09. As the RV
baseline is now much larger than the orbital period, the orbital
parameters are better constrained. Using, in addition, the abso-

available on the ESO archive cover the same time base as those used by
Marmier et al. (2013).

3.2.7. HIP 70849
HIP 70848 is a 0 :630:03 M , K7V star (S√©gransan et al. 2011).
S√©gransan et al. (2011) reported the Ô¨Årst detection of HIP 70849
b based on 18 RV measurements obtained with the HARPS spec-
trograph between 2006 and 2010. However, only one minimum
of the HIP 70849 b RV curve was covered by the dataset. The
observations carried out by S√©gransan et al. (2011) led to poorly
constrained orbital parameters and minimum mass. Using a ge-
netic algorithm followed by MCMC simulations, they reported
a semi-major axis between 4.5 and 36 au, a minimum mass be-
tween 3 and 15 M Jup, and an eccentricity between 0.47 and 0.96
with ranges corresponding to a 3 conÔ¨Ådence interval.

We considered 39 additional pieces of HARPS RV data ob-
tained between 2011 and 2021. We combined the RV data with
the absolute astrometry (Fig.7). With these additional observa-
tions, the dataset then covered two minimum and one maximum
of the RV curve of HIP 70849 b and this allowed us to prop-
erly constrain the properties of the companion. We found a semi-
major axis of 3 :99+0:06
 0:07au and an eccentricity of 0 :65+0:02
 0:01. Using,
in addition, the absolute astrometry, we found an orbital inclina-
tion of 96 16¬∞ and a true mass of 4 :5+0:4
 0:3MJup.
4. Summary and concluding remarks
Combining RV measurements from various spectrographs with
absolute astrometry based on Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 data
and, when available, relative astrometry, we determined the or-
bital parameters and, in particular, the orbital inclination and the

true mass of seven long-period single companions detected by
the RV method. Figure 8 summarizes the true mass and the semi-
major axis of the companions and compares them with the previ-
ous estimations. Clearly, Gaia EDR3 data allow for a better de-
termination of these companions‚Äô orbital parameters and mass.
All of these companions have true masses of 2 M Jupor more and
orbit between 3.9 - 9 au from their stars. Absolute astrometry
would probably help to determine the true mass of planets with
a period larger than the duration of Gaia DR3 observations (P
>1000 d) down to 1 M Jup, provided the RV variations are
well covered and the variations in position and acceleration of
the proper motion of the star are large enough. In practice, in
most cases, when the period is not well constrained by the RV
data, the impact of the coupling of RV data with absolute as-
trometry is more limited. An illustration of this is the case of
HD 211847 B for which, by combining RV data that cover only
a minimum of the RV variations with absolute astrometry, Feng

Notes: The results were obtained by combining RV , absolute astrometry, and, when available, relative astrometry. We provide 68%
conÔ¨Ådence intervals for each parameter and the median is only given when the probability distribution has a proÔ¨Åle close to a
Gaussian distribution.
Fig. 8: Update of the orbital parameters and masses of the seven
analyzed systems thanks to the combination of absolute astro-
metric and RV data and, when available, absolute astrometry

et al. (2022) reported a mass of about 55 M Jup, corresponding to
a brown dwarf. Yet, HCI revealed a companion and the Ô¨Åt of the
RV and the relative and absolute astrometry leads to a mass of
about 150 M Jupinstead.
We conclude that Gaia /Hipparcos can help to further con-
strain the orbital parameters of long-period RV planets, provid-
ing good coverage of the RV variations is available. Otherwise,
additional information is needed, such as relative astrometry,
provided by DI or interferometry.
