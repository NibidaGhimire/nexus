Abstract
An operator formalism is used on the wavefunction of baryons to co mpute their
charge radii and quadrupole moments. Total anti-symmetric wave function in spin,
color and ﬂavor space is framed for JP=1
2+nucleons and JP=3
2+hyperons. To
understand the importance of sea, statistical model is used in con jugation with the
detailed balance principle. Within the statistical approach, the impor tance of sea
with quarks and gluons are studied using the relevant probabilities th at are associ-
ated with spin, ﬂavor, and color space. The present work also focu ses on individual
contributions of valence and sea which contains terms of scalar, ve ctor and tensor sea.
The obtained results are in agreement with available theories and few experimental
outcomes. Our computed results may provide important informatio n for upcoming
experimental ﬁndings.
1 Introduction
The main goal for particle physicists is to understand the st ructure of hadrons. The study
of electromagnetic properties of baryons over the last two d ecades enhances our under-
standing of the internal structure of baryons and gives new d irections about the properties
of matter. Various discoveries of proton suggest that quark s-antiquarks carry 30% of the
total proton spin. Further, it has been predicted [1] that th e orbital angular momentum of
quarksand gluons also make asigniﬁcant contribution tothe proton’s spinandother static
properties [2] of the baryons like magnetic moment, masses, etc. It is also conﬁrmed that
there is a signiﬁcant eﬀect from the strange quarks [3, 4] whic h are assumed to be present
in the sea. Usually, the ’sea’ is a combination of virtual glu ons and quark-antiquark pairs.
It may contain light quarks as well as heavy ones and plays a vi tal role in determining
the hadronic structure. Therefore, to go into deeper detail s of the structure of baryons, it
1becomes mandatory to investigate their low energy properti es. The most common prop-
erties to study the structure of hadrons are magnetic moment s, masses, semi-leptonic
decays, charge radii, quadrupole moment and spin distribut ion etc. Although, Quantum
Chromodynamics(QCD) is the fundamental theory of strong in teractions of hadrons but
presently these properties can not be predicted directly fr om QCD. The study of hadronic
structure is complicated due to the non-perturbative inter action between the fundamental
constituents (i.e. quarks and gluons). To get an interior im age of the baryons, the the-
orist depends upon phenomenological models and eﬀective the ories. Over the past years
[5, 6, 7], we have witnessed remarkable discoveries in the ar ea of phenomenology. The
charge radii and quadrupole moments are important observab les of hadrons that contain
information about their quark-gluon structure. These are d irectly related to the spatial
charge and current distribution in baryons. Various scatte ring experiments [8] have been
made measurements for the charge radii of the proton, neutro n and Σ−giving values rp
= 0.8409 ±0.0004 fm, r2
n= -0.115 ±0.0017 fm2and Σ−= 0.78±0.10 fm listed in
PDG [7]. On reviewing the previous literature, many theoret ical models like the quark
model [9, 10, 11], light cone QCD sum rules [12, 13], the Skyrm e model with bound-state
approach [14], QCD parametrization method [15, 16], the 1/N cexpansion method[17, 18],
lattice QCD [19, 20] and chiral constituent quark model ( χQM) [21, 22, 23] analysed the
various properties of baryons such as magnetic moment, char ge radii, octupole moments,
quadrupolemoments etc. By using the QCD sum rule approach in ref. [12, 13], the author
estimated the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and ma gnetic octupole moments of
∆-baryons. In ref. [17, 18], the authors predicted the charg e radii and quadrupole mo-
ment of decuplet baryons by 1/ Ncexpansion method. In ref. [19, 20], the charge radii of
decuplet baryons have been studied in lattice QCD. In ref. [2 1, 22, 23], the charge radii,
quadrupole moment of (1
2)+octet, (3
2)+decuplet baryons and spin (3
2)+→(1
2)+tran-
sitions are calculated in the framework of χCQM using general parameterization (GP)
method. An enormous amount of experimental information [7] is available now, which
caters to the need of detailed comparisons between theory an d experimental data. Also,
the decuplet to octet transition moment plays an important r ole in studying the internal
structure of the spin. The quadrupole transition moment(∆+→N) measured by LEGS
[24] and Mainz [25] collaborations ( −0.018±0.009±0.034 fm2and−0.0846±0.0033 fm2)
respectively [26] brings to the conclusion that the nucleon and ∆+baryon are intrinsically
deformed.
There are many theoretical approaches in the literature to s tudy electromagnetic prop-
erties. But the results from diﬀerent theoretical models are not consistent with each
other. In order to have a clear understanding, we study these electromagnetic properties
(quadrupole moment and charge radii) in the framework of the statistical model with the
principle of detailed balance. In this model, hadrons are as sumed to consist of valence
quarks which are associated with a virtual dynamic sea where quark-antiquark pairs are
multi-connected through gluons. Singh & Upadhyay et al. [27 ] used the statistical model
to ﬁnd the quark contribution to the spin of the nucleons. The statistical model with
the inclusion of ’sea quarks’ successfully explains the low energy hadronic properties like
2masses [28], spin distribution [29], magnetic moments [30] of octet and decuplet baryons,
and importance of sea contribution to nucleons [31]. As this approach has been proven to
be quite eﬀective in the calculation of static properties of b aryons. So, we extended the
statistical model along with the principle of detailed bala nce by computing the quadrupole
moments and charge radii of the ground state nucleons and ∆-h yperons.
This paper is organised in the following order: In sec. 2, a br ief overview of octet and
decuplet baryons wavefunction with sea components is given . Sec. 3, presents the expla-
nation of quadrupole moment and charge radii operator. In Se c. 4, the statistical model
with the detailed balance principle is discussed. The impor tance of statistical parameters
to the static properties of baryons is also explained. In Sec . 5, we discuss the calculated
charge radii and quadrupole moment, and compare the compute d values to the recent
available experimental and theoretical data. The conclusi on is given in the sec. 6.
2 Preliminaries
The naive valence picture of the hadron structure is conside red as a ﬁrst-order approx-
imation to the real system. With the extension of the naive qu ark model, baryons are
assumed a composite system of valence quark (qqq) and a ’sea’ , where sea contains glu-
ons and virtual quark-antiquark pairs [32, 33]. Sea is chara cterized by its total quantum
number consistent with the quantum number of valence quarks . The valence quark wave-
function of the baryon [34] is written as:
Ψ = Φ(|φ >|ξ >|χ >|ρ >)
where|φ >,|ξ >,|χ >and|ρ >represent the ﬂavor, spin, color and space q3wave func-
tions respectively. Here, the spatial part |ρ >is symmetric under the exchange of any
two quarks. The other three parts ﬂavor-spin-color must be a nti-symmetric in order to
maintain the overall anti-symmetrization of the baryons. T he three valence quarks each
having spin-1
2will lead to the possibility of JP=1

andbeingthegroundstateparticles, thesequarks(fermion s)havepositiveparitywhich
is given by ( −1)l. We take into consideration a ﬂavorless sea having spin (0, 1 , 2) and
color (1, 8, ¯10). Let H0,1,2andG1,8,¯10represent the spin and color sea wave functions
respectively which satisfy the condition: < Hi|Hj>=δij,< Gk|Gl>=δkl. The ’sea’ is
supposed to be comprised of a gluon or a q¯qpair, or more complicated, with multi-gluon
state (gg, ggg), multi- q¯qpairs or gluon(s) plus ( q¯q) pairs. The spin (H) and color (G)
combination of sea having two gluons, q¯qor multi q¯qpairs can be present as:

the scalar sea whereas the coeﬃcients b1,b8,b10,c8andd8are from the vector and tensor
sea respectively. Similarly, in the decuplet wavefunction , the coeﬃcient a0comes with the
contribution of scalar sea and the coeﬃcients b1,b8andd1,d8come with the contribution
of vector and tensor sea respectively. These coeﬃcients ( a0,a8,a10,b1,b8,b10,c8,d8) are
associated with each state in the wavefunction has their own importance. They contain
information about the various properties of hadrons like ma sses, magnetic moment, spin
distribution etc. The details of all the terms of above-ment ioned wave function can be
found in refs. [34, 35].
43 Quadrupole Moment and Charge radii
Charge radii ( r2
B) and quadrupole moments ( QB) are the lowest order moments of the
charge density ρin a low-momentum expansion. They are used to characterize t he total
charge, spatial extension, and shape of the baryons. Here, i ntrinsic quadrupole moment
means the one obtained in a body-ﬁxed-coordinate system tha t rotates with the nucleon.
The nucleonic vertex function in terms of Electromagnetic D irac and Pauli form factors
F1(Q2) andF2(Q2) is represented as:
Γµ=F1(Q2)γµ+κF2(Q2(iσµνqν
2m)) (3)
whereκis the anomalous part of the magnetic moment, γµare Dirac matrices and σµν=
i(γµγν−γνγµ)/2. Further, the electric and magnetic Sach form factors GE(Q2) and
GM(Q2) [36] can be related as:
GE=F1−τκF2 (4)
GM=F1+κF2 (5)
whereκ= (Q
2m)2. The study of electromagnetic form factors of hadrons has re ceived a lot
of attention over the past years. The Fourier transform of th e elastic form factors provide
insights about the radial variation of the charge ρ(r) and current j(r) densities [37]. The
observation by the physicists suggests that the ratio betwe en electric and magnetic form
factors decreases sharply for 1 < Q2<6GeV2[38]. The experimental evidence shows that
thereisavariation of chargedistributionfromsphericals ymmetry. Itwassuggested earlier
that the quadrupole moment of nucleon should vanish on accou nt of spin-1
2nature which
is the subject of theoretical and experimental activity. In addition, quadrupole moments
of the decuplet baryons are still not clear. The transition a mplitude in the γ+p→∆+
gives us information about photon absorption amplitudes, t he magnetic dipole GM1and
electric quadrupolemoment from GE2andGC2[39] respectively. Electric quadrupole( E2)
matrix elements, including quadrupole moments provide a pr incipal measure of nuclear
deformation, rotation, and related collective structure. The recent data from the collabo-
rations [41] like Jlab, Mainz predicts a non-zero value of qu adrupole moment. The ratio of
electric quadrupole to the magnetic dipole amplitude i.e.E2
M1=−0.025±0.005. Similarly,
the measurements made by LEGS and Mainz collaboration [26, 4 2] conclude that nucleon
and ∆+baryons have a deformity from spherical symmetric distribu tion. The geometrical
shape of baryons can be measured from intrinsic quadrupole m oments [43]:
Qp
0=/integraldisplay
d3rρp(r)(3z2−r2) (6)
whereρp(r) is not necessarily spherically symmetric charge density o f proton. If the charge
density is concentrated along the z-direction (symmetry ax is of the particle), the term
proportional to 3 z2dominates, Q0is positive, and the particle is prolate. If the charge
density is concentrated in the equatorial plane perpendicu lar to z, the term proportional
5tor2prevails, Q0is negative, and the particle is oblate. The most general for m of the
multipole expansion of the charge density ρin the spin-ﬂavor space can be expressed as:
ρ=Aσ3
i=1eiI−B (7)
In order to ﬁnd the quadrupole moment of baryon, a general QCD unitary operator and
QCD eigen states |B/an}bracketri}htare deﬁned explicitly in terms of quark and gluons. The quadr upole
moment operator in terms of spin-ﬂavor space can be expresse d as [44]:

The z-component of the Pauli spin (isospin) matrix σiis denoted by σizandeiis the
charge of the i-th quark where i = (u,d,s). The expanded form o f the quadrupole moment
operator of octet and decuplet baryons [22] can be written as :

In the operator formalism [18, 45], the charge radii operato r can be expressed in terms of

Here/hatwider2
1/2and/hatwider2

respectively. The unknown parameters A, B and C arise in the e xpansion of quadrupole
moment and charge radii operators including the contributi on of orbital and color space
[16-18]. These constants (A, B and C) are determined from the experimental data on
charge radii and quadrupole moments.
For a better understanding of the internal structure of bary ons, an approach based on
operator formalism is employed. In this formalism, a suitab le operator which is associated

as listed in Table 1 and 2. One corresponds to the parameters u sed in operator formalism
(A, B and C). The values of these parameters (A, B and C) are ﬁtt ed by taking the
available experimental data on quadrupole moment and charg e radii as input. The other
ones are statistical coeﬃcients ( a0,a8,a10,b1,b8,b10,c8,d8) that plays a pivotal role in
determining the static properties of baryonic systems. As w e know, there is a dynamic
sea present with the valence quarks in the structure of baryo ns, where sea is a cluster
consisting of gluons and quark-antiquarks pairs. The contr ibution of sea in spin, ﬂavor
and color space are determined in terms of these parameters ( a0,a8,a10,b1,b8,b10,c8,d8).
In order to calculate these parameters, we apply a statistic al approach with the detailed
balance principle.

The statistical model assumes the decomposition of baryoni c state in various quark-gluon
Fock states such as |qqq/an}bracketri}ht|g/an}bracketri}ht,|qqq/an}bracketri}ht|gg/an}bracketri}ht,|qqq/an}bracketri}ht|q¯q/an}bracketri}htwith the possibility of gluon splitting into
q¯qpairs and the annihilation of quark-antiquark pairs into gl uons. The octet and decuplet
wavefunction of baryons includes the ﬂavor, color, and spin space. To ﬁnd the individual
contribution of ﬂavor, spin and color space, we calculate th eir relative probabilities. For
the relative probability in ﬂavor space, we depend upon the p rinciple of detailed balance
[46]. This principle proposed by Zhang et al. [47], based on t he assumption that every
two subensembles balance with each other in a way:
ρi,j,k|{q3},{i,j,k}/an}bracketri}htbalance⇐= = =⇒ρi′,j′,k′|{q3},{i′,j′,k′}/an}bracketri}ht
The basic assumption of balancing any two ensembles is that t he probability of ﬁnding
8hadrons in any Fock state should not change over time. The “go out” probability balance
the “come in” probability for any Fock state.

transition subprocesses such as q ⇔qg, g⇔q¯qand g⇔gg are considered to calculate the
transition probability of diﬀerent Fock states in ﬂavor spac e can be found in ref. [29, 47].
The transition probability talks about the chances of gluon (s)⇔u¯u,d¯d,s¯soru¯u⇔d¯d
states etc. This approach will change the Fock state & hence c hange the probability.
The transition probabilities RA→B,RB→Awork on the same principle. This principle
has been successfully explain the ﬂavor asymmetry of hadron s [27], Parton distribution
functions [48]. Moreover, the probabilities in spin and col or space are calculated from the
multiplicities in the statistical model. The multipliciti es for all Fock states are computed
in the form of ρp,qwhere the relative probability for valence part has ’Spin p’ and sea
carries ’Spin q’ such that the resultant spin should come out as 1/2 for octet baryons
and 3/2 for decuplet baryons. Similarly, the probabilities for the color spaces can be
calculated which yields the color singlet state. Detailed c alculations of these multiplicities
are discussed in ref. [27]. Further, the product of probabil ities in spin and color space
can be written in terms of a common multiplier “c” computed in the form of “nc”, where
n is the multiplicity factor for each Fock state [29]. The sum of the total probabilities
in spin and color space will give the coeﬃcients a0,a8,a10,b1,b8,b10,c8,d8to the total
wavefunction. These coeﬃcients give us the contribution of sea quarks in computing
the diﬀerent properties of baryons. The main part within the s tatistical model which
fascinates us that all the properties of baryons such as mass es, spin distribution, magnetic
moment etc. are interrelated with these probabilities (ﬂav or, spin and color). Detailed
information for the calculation of all the parameters using the statistical model is given in
Refs. [27, 35]. The statistical model in combination with th e principle of detailed balance

5 Results and Discussion
Low-energy electromagnetic properties of baryons like cha rge radii and quadrupole mo-
ments are very important to probetheir internal structure. Theseproperties arecomputed
by taking the eﬀect of scalar (spin 0), tensor (spin 2) and vect or (spin 1) sea. Individual
contribution suggests the dominancy of sea (scalar, vector & tensor) to the quadrupole
moment and charge radii of baryons. To examine the separate c ontribution of sea, we
assumea0,8,10/ne}ationslash= 0 and b1,8,10,c8,d8= 0 for scalar sea; whereas for vector sea b1,8,10,c8/ne}ationslash= 0
anda0,8,10,d8= 0; for tensor sea contribution, d8/ne}ationslash= 0 and b1,8,10,c8,a0,8,10= 0 for octet
9baryons. In similar manner, the individual contribution of sea (scalar, vector and tensor)
can be obtained for decuplet particles. It is worthy to menti on that the statistical coeﬃ-
cients (a0,8,10,b1,8,10,c8,d1,8) demonstrate the importance of scalar, vector and tensor se a
for determining the properties (charge radii and quadrupol e moment) of baryons. These
parameters are used as an input in the present work which is ta ken from the ref. [27, 35].
Diﬀerent forms (Model C, P and D) of the statistical model help to ﬁnd the role of sea dy-
namics to several static properties. We analyzed the proper ties (charge radii, quadrupole
moment) by using Model D which is stated by Singh & Upadhyay [2 7] that the contri-
bution of states with higher multiplicities is suppressed. The suppression is based on the
assumption that probability of a system in spin and color sta te is inversely proportional
to the multiplicity (both in spin and color spaces) of the sta te. We would also like to
mention that by taking the available experimental data on ch arge radii and quadrupole
moment as input, we ﬁt the parameters A, B and C by using χ2minimization. The set of
parameters (A, B and C) obtained after ﬁtting are presented i n Table 3 and 4.
5.1 Charge radii
To study the internal structure of hadrons, we are concerned with the two major crisis
’proton spin’ and ’proton charge radius’ which still remain unresolved. The proton ra-
dius puzzle has motivated new theoretical and experimental work. Recently PRad, an
electron-proton scattering experiment at Jeﬀerson Lab [49] , reported a proton charge ra-
dius of 0.831±0.007stat.±0.012sys.fm. Moreover, in the three most recent H-spectroscopy
measurements [50-52], two experimentsfoundasmall radius (rp= 0.833±0.010 fm)[50,52]
and another one supports a larger value of charge radii ( rp= 0.877 fm) of proton [51]. The
electric charge radii are related to the spatial distributi on of charged constituents (quarks)
and provide information about the size of the hadrons. Using the statistical method, we
present the calculated numerical values of electric charge radii of nucleons ( JP=1
2+) and
∆-hyperons ( JP=3
2+) in Table 3. In order to get the signiﬁcant contribution of se a, the
statistical parameters ( a0,8,10,b1,8,10,c8,d1,8) combine with valence part and the value of
charge radii of baryons are determined. For nucleons (p, n), the dominancy of vector sea
can be easily observed. Since the sea part is dominated by the emission of virtual gluons,
we can expect the major contribution coming from the vector s ea parameters ( b1,b8,c8)
to the charge radii of nucleons. For JP=3
2+particles, we observed that the scalar sea
is an active contributor from the total sea. This might be due to the larger multiplicities
of valence quark spin states when combined with the sea quark s spin (i.e. spin- 0,1 and
2). The probability of having spin-3
2is more when coupled with spin-0 (scalar sea) as
compared to spin-1 (vector sea). For both octet and decuplet baryons, the tensor sea
appears to be less dominating due to the quark spin-ﬂip proce ss but its eﬀect cannot be
neglected. For ∆0, only vector sea contributed while pure scalar and tensor se a impact is
zero. Because the contribution of valence quark across the s calar sea ( a0) and tensor sea
(d1,d8) term is zero.
The importance of sea lies in the suppression of higher multi plicities of the quark-gluon
10Fock states. However in case, when the sea is excluded in the s tatistical model, the charge
radii deviates more than 50% from the computed value. The dev iation is maximum for
the proton and ∆++is evident in Table 3. On the contrary, if the total sea (scala r, vec-
tor, and tensor) is taken, the charge radii of nucleons is pre tty close to the experimental
value [7]. On comparison our predicted value of charge radii shows good agreement in
sign and magnitude with diﬀerent phenomenological models [1 8, 21-23, 53-55]. Various
theoretical models [18, 21] show the same sign for both parti cles ∆+,∆−. Although, the
diﬀerence in sign of charge radii of ∆+,∆−matches with the Lattice QCD predictions [56]
within the error of 20%. Also, the three parameters A, B and C a re essential for valence
quark distribution in charge radii. In order to understand t he individual contribution of
one-, two- and three-quark term, we calculated the charge ra dii corresponding to one- and
two-quark terms by taking the value of C=0. After putting C=0 , the results are aﬀected,
as charge radii decreases in case of nucleons and for decuple t baryons, predicted values
are increased upto 40%. It indicates that a small variation i n ’C’ leads to a considerable
change in charge radii values.

5.2 Quadrupole moment
Quadrupolemomentsaresigniﬁcantforprovidingevidencef orthenon-sphericityofbaryons.
They are important for determining the shapeof baryons. Wit hin the statistical approach,
we present the computed values of quadrupole moments in Tabl e 4. The individual con-
tributions of scalar, vector and tensor sea are also present ed in the Table 4. For nucleons
(p, n), vector sea is the only active contributor from the tot al sea. This means that the
quadrupole moment is mainly aﬀected by vectorial sea paramet ers (b1,b8,c8) having spin
1. For decuplet baryons (∆++,∆+,∆−), the scalar sea contribution is greater as compared
11to vector and tensor sea. Due to the quark spin-ﬂip process, t he tensor sea has negligible
contribution. The valence quark coupled with spin 0,1 and 2 ( scalar, vector and tensor sea
respectively) resulting into a large no. of spin states. The estimated multiplicities from
spin states suggests that the higher multiplicity have a low er probability of survival. This
might indicate that the chances of having spin-3
2+is more with the scalar sea (spin-0) as
compared to vector and tensor sea. In case of ∆0, neither vector nor scalar sea contributes,
but a little bit of contribution comes from the tensor sea.
In general, when the sea is completely excluded in the statis tical model, the value of
quadrupole moment shows a large deviation from the computed value which shows the
active participation of sea quarks. A considerable change o ccurs only in the magnitude
of the quadrupole moment but not in the sign. From this, we con cluded that the im-
pact of sea quarks do not directly aﬀect the shape of baryons bu t rather it inﬂuences the
overall structure of baryons. The sea contribution in quadr upole moment are given in
Table 4 from diﬀerent models. As there is no experimental info rmation available for the
quadrupole moments of baryons, we compare our ﬁndings with o ther theoretical predic-
tions [16, 55, 57, 58] and they are consistent with the ref. [2 1, 23]. In the statistical model,
the value of quadrupolemoment observed an oblate shape for p , n, ∆++,∆0baryons while
a prolate shape for ∆+,∆−baryon. The quadrupole moment of ∆+,∆−show strange be-
havior with respect to the parameter ’C’ which includes the c ontribution of three-quark
term. If we put C=0, a -ve sign for ∆+and a +ve sign for ∆−observed which is consistent
with other theoretical models [16, 21, 53]. Although, a cons iderable change in the value
of quadrupole moment observed after putting C=0. This shows the importance of three-
quark term parameter ’C’ to the quadrupole moment values. Si milarly, by putting B=0,
the contribution corresponding to the three-quark term can be calculated. The results are
presented in the table below:

126 Conclusion
In the present paper, a statistical approach with the princi ple of detailed balance is used
to calculate the electromagnetic properties i.e. charge ra dii and quadrupole moments of
the nucleons and ∆-hyperons. Our main purpose is to study the impact of sea quarks
on the properties of baryons in the framework of statistical model with detailed balance
principle. It is important to study the sea because we expect the sea to be a decisive fac-
tor for determine the properties of baryons. A suitable anti -symmetric wavefunction for
baryons written in spin, color, ﬂavor space is operated with charge radii and quadrupole
moment operator. Since the sea contains quark-gluon Fock st ates, the statistical prin-
ciple determine the probabilities for these Fock states in t erms of statistical parameters
(a0,a8,a10,b1,b8,b10,c8,d8). With the help of these parameters, we deeply explore the
individual sea contribution to the charge radii and quadrup ole moment of baryons. The
parameter ’C’ considerably contributes to the spin-spin in teraction term of three-quarks.
The quadrupole moment and charge radii are associated with t he spin contribution and
spatial charge distribution of the particles respectively . And the sea spin contribution is
reﬂected in the results of these properties. Based on our ana lysis of the quadrupole mo-
ment, we conclude that the sea quarks have a pronounced impac t on the overall structure
of baryons, without directly inducing any changes in their s hape. Also, our numerical
analysis appreciated the presence of sea (scalar, vector an d tensor) and gives crucial infor-
mation about the geometrical structure of baryons. It is imp ortant to mention that our
calculations performed in a non-relativistic frame and hol d good for the hadronic energy
scale of order 1 GeV2.
