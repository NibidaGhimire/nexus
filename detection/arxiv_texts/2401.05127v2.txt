A vectorial optical mode converter that can transform an orthogonal set of multiple input vector
beams into another orthogonal set of vector beams is attractive for a wide range of applications in
optics and photonics. While multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) and metasurface (MS) technolo-
gies have been explored to individually address multiple spatial mode conversion and polarization
mode manipulation, there has been no universal methodology to simultaneously convert a set of
multiple vectorial modes, having non-uniform spatial distributions in both their complex amplitude
and polarization, to another set of multiple vectorial modes. In this paper, we demonstrate versatile
devices based on the MPLC concept incorporating multi-layer locally birefringent MSs and present a
general design formalism for complete vectorial mode conversion in arbitrary cases. The effectiveness
of our proposed method is confirmed experimentally by demonstrating a 6-mode (3 spatial modes
×2 polarization modes) multiplexer, fabricated on a compact chip with a ∼0.65 mm2lateral size
in a folded MS configuration. Additionally, we verify its applicability to more advanced functional
devices through numerical demonstration of a mode-division-multiplexed dual-polarization coherent
receiver and spatial-mode-multiplexed vectorial holography. The versatility of our protocol makes
it suitable for designing a myriad of multi-input-multi-output devices, providing a powerful tool for
realizing universal optical mode converters for a wide range of applications.
Every linear optical component can be considered as a mode converter that transforms a specific set of input orthog-
onal modes into another set of output orthogonal modes [1]. The optical modes generally provide the fundamental
basis for describing complex optical systems in an explicit and economical manner [2]. To enjoy the maximum degrees
of freedom (DoFs) of light in a given optical system, therefore, full usage of optical modes, including the spatial and
polarization modes in addition to the wavelength, is essential. In space-division multiplexed (SDM) optical communi-
cation, for example, a large number of dual-polarization spatial modes are multiplexed in an optical fiber to increase
the transmission capacity [3–8]. The use of multiple vectorial optical modes with non-uniform spatial profiles in both
their complex amplitude and polarization, such as cylindrical vector beams (CVBs) [9], has also been explored to boost
the information density of free-space optical (FSO) communication [10–13] and holographic imaging [14–18] systems.
It is, therefore, of paramount interest in optics and photonics to develop a universal converter that can transform
an arbitrary set of orthogonal vectorial modes with generally non-uniform polarization profiles into another set of
orthogonal vectorial modes. In particular, an ideally lossless device that achieves unitary multi-input-multi-output
(MIMO) vectorial mode conversion is attractive for diverse applications.
To this end, multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) is a promising approach that has been successful in achieving uni-
versal spatial mode conversion for scalar optical fields [19–21]. Through a succession of transverse phase manipulation
and free-space propagation, an arbitrary orthogonal set of spatial modes can be converted into another set of spatial
modes in a unitary manner [19]. Using a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a multi-reflecting mirror, highly scalable
mode (de)multiplexers for hundreds of optical modes have been demonstrated [22, 23]. Such MPLC concept has also
been demonstrated on integrated photonic platforms, where various types of multi-input optical mode mixers were
employed to replace free-space propagation [24–28]. Owing to the inherent scalability and excellent performances,
MPLC devices have widely been used for various applications, including optical communication [6, 20, 21, 28–33],
quantum optics [34], and optical computing [26, 35].
Despite these advantages, however, conventional MPLC schemes have been limited to the conversion of scalar optical
fields. While a polarization-diversity scheme can be employed to apply independent spatial mode conversion to two
polarization states [36, 37], such an approach cannot transform non-uniform spatial distributions of polarization in
an arbitrary manner, which is insufficient to achieve complete conversion of multiple vector beams in general cases.
On the other hand, all-dielectric metasurfaces (MSs) have been studied actively over the past decade as efficient
flat optical devices that can manipulate the polarization properties of incident beams [38–40]. They are composed
of two-dimensional (2D) arrays of sub-wavelength scatterers called meta-atoms, each of which generally has asym-
metric geometries and functions as an ultra-small birefringent material. Through judicious design of meta-atoms,
therefore, a variety of polarization-dependent properties can be obtained, such as polarization beam splitting and
polarization-dependent holographic imaging [18, 41–46]. Whereas these previous demonstrations using mono-layer or
bi-layer MS devices employed an input beam with a single spatial mode, simultaneous conversion of multiple vectorial

modes with arbitrary spatial and polarization profiles requires beam propagation through cascaded layers of MSs.
However, versatile multi-layered MS devices to achieve universal and simultaneous MIMO vectorial mode conversions
for arbitrary cases have not been demonstrated to our knowledge.
In this paper, we present a fully vectorial mode converter using a multi-layer MS and provide a general design
formalism to realize desired MIMO vectorial mode conversions for arbitrary cases. We combine the concepts of
MPLC and MS by replacing the scalar phase masks in conventional MPLC devices with locally birefringent MSs. As
a result, the conventional MPLC theory is extended to include multiple stages of Jones matrices. We then derive an
explicit inverse design protocol based on the adjoint method to optimize all the meta-atoms in each MS layer so that
a target mode conversion is obtained. The presented concept is validated experimentally by demonstrating a 6-mode
(3 spatial modes ×2 polarization modes) multiplexer using a 4-layer MS, fabricated on a compact ∼0.65 mm2chip
with a folded MS configuration. Furthermore, the applicability of our scheme to more advanced functional devices
is verified numerically by demonstrating a mode-division-multiplexed (MDM) dual-polarization coherent receiver and
spatial-mode-multiplexed vectorial holography with excellent performances. Owing to the versatility of the presented
formalism, a variety of vectorial mode converters can be realized to utilize the full DoFs of optical beams for diverse
applications.
MULTI-INPUT VECTORIAL MODE CONVERTER USING A MULTI-LAYER METASURFACE
Figure 1a shows the schematic of the vectorial mode converter using Llayers of MSs. By repeating multiple
stages of lightwave conversion through the birefringent MS and propagation through the free space, we can achieve
simultaneous conversions of Morthogonal input vectorial modes to Mdesired output vectorial modes, including
their polarization profiles. In practice, this device can be implemented by a single compact chip with the folded MS
configuration [47–49] as shown in Fig. 1b.
The input vectorial field of the m-th mode ( m= 1,2, . . . , M ) can be written in a Jones-vector form as

where r= (x, y)tdenotes the in-plane position and ain
m,X/Y(r) represents the X/Y -polarized components of the field.
(Note that we employ uppercase XandYto represent the polarization and lowercase xandyto represent the in-plane
position in this paper to avoid confusion.) Here, we assume that the in-plane variation of the field is gradual compared
with the wavelength so that the zcomponent of the electromagnetic field can be ignored. For convenience, we use
the Dirac notation to represent the input field as

1,2, . . . , N ;p=X, Y) represents the orthonormal basis in terms of position and polarization. For convenience, rn
are matched to the center positions of periodically placed meta-atoms. Following successive free-space propagation

XandYpolarization components of light independently follow the Helmholtz equations as they propagate through
a uniform medium, they do not couple during free-space propagation. We thus have ⟨n, p|ˆF(l)|n′, p′⟩= 0 ( p̸=p′).

In Eq. (7), α(l)(rn) and β(l)(rn) represent the phase shifts for the eigenmode waves polarized along the slow and
fast axes of the meta-atom, respectively, and γ(l)(rn) is the angle of orientation. Arbitrary phase shifts αandβcan
be obtained by judiciously selecting the dimensions of the meta-atom ( Dα, Dβ) along the two axes as shown in the
bottom inset of Fig. 1a [46, 51]. Therefore, each meta-atom can be described using three design parameters: α,β,
andγ.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
To validate the generalized formalism and the optimization method presented in the previous section, we first
consider a simple example of a 6-mode (3 spatial modes ×2 polarization modes) multiplexer. Figure 2a shows the
schematic of the device. It is composed of a row of four reflective MS sections integrated on one side of a 625- µm-thick
fused silica (SiO 2) substrate and a total-reflection mirror layer with input/output apertures on the other side. Figure
3a shows the reflective meta-atom employed in this work, which consists of a Si nanopost with a height of 0.57 µm,
capped with a polyimide layer and a gold mirror layer. The lateral dimension of each MS section is chosen to be
300µm×360µm, which is sufficiently larger than forward-propagated beams at the first MS layer and backward-
propagated beams at the last MS layer for all modes. The incident light transmitted through the input aperture is
reflected back and forth between the MS and mirror layers and exits through the output aperture. We aim to design
each MS section so that six X-polarized Gaussian beams ( m= 1, ...,6) arranged on an equally spaced 2 ×3 array at
the input plane are converted into polarization-multiplexed spatial modes at the output plane. As the output spatial
modes, we assume LP modes inside a few-mode fiber (FMF) with a mode field diameter (MFD) of 15 µm, supporting
three spatial modes (LP 01, LP 11a, and LP 11b) at 1550-nm wavelength. As shown in the left and right insets of Fig. 2a,
X-polarized input beams at m= 1, 3, and 5 (2, 4, and 6) are converted to X-polarized ( Y-polarized) LP 11b, LP 01,
and LP 11amodes, respectively, centered at the same position. Owing to the folded MS configuration, simultaneous
MIMO vectorial mode conversion can be achieved using a single compact chip.
Figures 2b and 2c respectively show the MS parameters of the optimized design and the simulated vectorial field dis-
tributions at the output plane for each input mode (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 2 for the design procedure).
We can confirm that each input mode is transformed to the desired spatial and polarization mode. For quantitative
evaluation, we employ the coupling efficiency matrix C, whose components are defined as Cmm′=|⟨atar
m|aout
m′⟩|2. The
calculated Cfor the optimized MS design is shown in Fig. 2d. The insertion loss and crosstalk are suppressed below
0.95 dB and −30 dB for all six modes.
Figure 3b shows the microscope images of the fabricated device (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 3 for the
details of the fabrication process). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the MS before capping the polyimide
layer are shown in Fig. 3c. The lateral dimension of the entire device is 1.8 mm ×0.36 mm ∼0.65 mm2.
The fabricated device was characterized at 1550-nm wavelength using the setup shown in Fig. 3d (see Methods6

for the details). Figure 3e shows the X- and Y-polarized intensity profiles, which were observed for each input fiber
position. We can confirm that each input mode was converted to the corresponding LP and polarization mode as
designed. The total transmission loss from the input SMF to the output light was measured to be 4.0 dB for all
six inputs. The coupling efficiency matrix was calculated using the complex field profiles measured by the off-axis
holography (detailed explanation is given in Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4). The total coupling
loss to the designed LP modes was in the range of 13.8 to 17.7 dB. This relatively large modal mismatch may result
from various reasons. First, fabrication errors of MS, such as variations in Si nanopost geometries and the polyimide
layer thickness, should have caused undesired scattering and non-perfect conversion of optical modes. In addition,
various issues in the experiment, such as the deviation of the incident beam from the ideal Gaussian beam assumed in
the design, possible misalignment particularly in the incident angle, and undesired reflection at the input facet, should
have increased the error from the ideal case. There is, therefore, a large room for improvement through optimizing
the device fabrication and measurement system.7
APPLICATIONS TO FUNCTIONAL MULTI-MODAL DEVICES
To further investigate the efficacy of our scheme for more advanced applications, we design and numerically demon-
strate fully vectorial MIMO devices for two other use cases: (i) MDM dual-polarization coherent receiver and (ii)
spatial-mode-multiplexed vectorial holography.
MDM dual-polarization coherent receiver
MDM technology using a multi-mode fiber (MMF) is promising for future optical communication systems to break
the limit of transmission capacity through an SMF [3, 4]. In a polarization-multiplexed coherent MDM system, the
receiver requires complex optical components to demultiplex all space/polarization modes and interfere each of them
with the LO light through an optical hybrid before the detection by balanced photodiodes (PDs). While we have
recently demonstrated the use of a mono-layer MS to achieve simultaneous detection of spatially separated multiple
coherent signals from a multi-core fiber [53], the same approach cannot be applied to demodulate MDM signals from
an MMF that overlap heavily in space. Conventionally, therefore, MDM coherent receivers were implemented using
three separate devices: a spatial mode demultiplexer, a polarization-beam splitter (PBS), and an optical hybrid for
each mode [5–8]. Recently, Wen et al. have proposed a scalar MPLC-based device that combines a spatial mode
demultiplexer and 90◦optical hybrids for a single polarization [30, 31]. However, a single device that can receive
dual-polarization MDM coherent signals has never been demonstrated to our knowledge.
Here, we demonstrate a novel optical receiver frontend using our proposed vectorial mode converter that achieves
all of the above functionalities, namely, a spatial mode demultiplexer, a PBS, and optical hybrids for all spa-
tial/polarization modes, in one device. Figure 4a shows the configuration of the proposed MDM dual-polarization
coherent receiver. We assume six layers of MSs ( L= 6) with 400- µm-square area and a negligible thickness, each
separated by 1 mm. In practice, the entire device can be implemented in a folded MS structure, offering a cost-effective
solution to realize compact MDM coherent receivers.
Similar to the case considered in the previous section, we assume an FMF with an MFD of 15 µm that supports
dual-polarization signals in the three spatial modes (LP 01, LP 11a, and LP 11b) at 1550-nm wavelength. As the LO
light, we assume X-polarized LP 01mode from an SMF, having an MFD of 10 µm. These fibers are placed at the input
plane, with a separation of 127 µm. For convenience, we define m= 1, ...,6 to represent the six space/polarization
modes of the signals and m= 7 to represent the LO mode as shown in Fig. 4b.
Through adjoint optimization of meta-atoms, all lightwaves are converted to Xpolarization and focused on 24
distinct points at the output plane, as shown in Fig. 4c. Here, each signal mode ( m= 1, ...,6) is focused on four
vertically aligned points along its corresponding column. The optical phases at these four points are shifted by π/2.
In contrast, the LO beam ( m= 7) is split into 24 points with equal optical power and phases. As they interfere,
therefore, we obtain the functionality of a 90◦optical hybrid for each signal mode so that six coherent signals can be
demodulated simultaneously by placing PDs at these 24 positions.
Figure 4d shows the obtained objective function Eas a function of iteration, which shows good convergence after
around 200 iterations. Figures 4e and 4f show the MS parameters of the optimized design and the vectorial field
distributions at the output for each input mode, respectively (the evolution of vectorial field at each MS plane is
provided in Supplementary Fig. 5). We can see that all modes are focused onto the well-defined positions with desired
phases.
For quantitative evaluation, Table I summarises the performances of our designed MDM coherent receiver. Rigorous
definitions and derivations of all metrics are given in the Methods section. We can see that the insertion loss is less
than 0.9 dB for all modes with a low MDL of 0.1 dB. The crosstalk to other undesired PDs is suppressed below
−25 dB, showing excellent spatial/polarization mode demultiplexing functions. Furthermore, the phase error and
power imbalance within the four spots of each mode, which characterize the performance of the optical hybrid, are
suppressed below 1.4◦and 0.6 dB, respectively. In addition, our device is confirmed to exhibit fairly robust operation
across the entire C-band (1530-1565 nm) without significant degradation in performance. Furthermore, increasing the
number of layers generally leads to enhanced performance, owing to the larger degrees of freedom. (The wavelength
dependence and effect of increasing the number of MS layers are examined in detail in Supplementary Notes 3 and 4,
respectively.)
Spatial-mode-multiplexed vectorial holography
MS-based holography has been actively studied as a unique method to generate different images depending on the
input and output polarization states [14, 15, 18, 44, 45, 50, 51, 54, 55]. By tuning the birefringence of each meta-atom,8

we can independently control the optical phase (and amplitude) distributions of X- and Y-polarization components
and thereby synthesize separate images for respective polarizations at a desired plane. While the prior demonstrations
mostly presumed an input beam with a single spatial mode, multiple spatial beams, such as Fourier modes [56–58]
and optical angular momentum (OAM) modes [59–62], could also be used to produce spatially multiplexed images.
Such spatial-mode-multiplexed holography, however, has been restricted to specific input modes that possess some9

sort of spatial symmetry to enable simultaneous conversion using a mono-layer MS. Universal conversion of multiple
beams, including their polarization profiles, for an arbitrary case of input vectorial modes would require transmission
through multiple layers of MSs. Here, we design our multi-layer MS device to demonstrate such an ultimate case of
spatial-mode-multiplexed vectorial holography with high efficiency for the first time.
Figure 5a shows the configuration of the entire system, where the output image varies depending on the input
vectorial mode and the analyzed polarization state. In this work, we select two CVB modes [9] with the topological
orders ( q) of +1 and +2 as the input spatial modes. Each CVB mode at 1550-nm wavelength is polarization-10
multiplexed so that we have four input modes ( m= 1,2,3,4) in total, as shown in the left inset of Fig. 5a. The input
beam diameter is set to 100 µm for all modes. After propagating through four layers of MSs ( L= 4), two different
holographic images per each CVB mode are created depending on the analyzed polarization states, PmandP′
m. Here,
PmandP′
mrepresent the orthogonal polarization states that are analyzed for the m-th mode. We should note that
the orthogonal polarization pair for each mode ( Pm,P′
m) can be freely selected, which is not possible with mono-layer
MSs in principle [63]. To demonstrate the versatility of our scheme, therefore, we set all four of them to be different
elliptical polarization states; the Stokes parameters S= (S1, S2, S3)tofPmandP′
m(m= 1,2,3,4) are selected to
constitute a regular hexahedron as shown in Fig. 5b.

m,Pm(r)|2and|atar
m,P′m(r)|2represent
them-th target holographic images for two orthogonal analyzing polarization states. Since we have the freedom to
choose arbitrary phase profiles of the images, the phase distributions of atar
m(r) are sequentially updated to match
those of the output vectorial fields aout
m(r) after each forward calculation. More specifically, atar
m(r) is replaced to
atar
m(r)eiϕ(r)in every iteration, where ϕ(r)≡arg[{atar
m(r)}†aout
m(r)] is the phase difference between the output and
target fields. This operation corresponds to the Gerchberg–Saxton (GS) algorithm [64] and automatically ensures
orthogonality between different target modes. Other parameters and optimization methods are the same as in the
previous section.
Figures 5c and 5d show the optimized MS parameters and simulated vectorial holographic images |aout

aperture array at the output plane, unlike previously demonstrated OAM-multiplexed holography [59–61]. We can
confirm that eight independent holographic images, including the fine texts and complex ginkgo mark of the University
of Tokyo, are successfully generated. The holography efficiency, defined as |⟨atar

m⟩|2, is as high as 93.5%, 93.4%,
88.8%, and 86.8% for m= 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
We have proposed and demonstrated a universal vectorial mode converter based on the MPLC concept with a
multi-layer MS. The Jones matrix formalism was incorporated inside the conventional MPLC theory to enable local
control of the polarization profiles of multiple beams in addition to their wavefronts. We then constructed a versatile
inverse design algorithm based on the adjoint method to realize desired MIMO conversions of fully vectorial modes
for arbitrary cases. The presented method was verified experimentally by demonstrating a 6-mode (LP 01, LP 11a, and
LP11bmodes in XandYpolarization states) multiplexer using a 4-layer MS. We designed and fabricated a compact
device based on the folded MS configuration, and confirmed fully vectorial mode conversion of six X-polarized input
beams to desired LP and polarization modes at the output plane. Furthermore, the applicability of our scheme to more
advanced MIMO devices was numerically demonstrated for two other use cases. First, a novel optical receiver frontend
for MDM dual-polarization coherent signals was demonstrated; with the optimized MSs, we achieved simultaneous
balanced homodyne detection of six coherent signals with excellent performances, such as 0.9-dB insertion loss, 0.1-
dB MDL, and 25-dB crosstalk suppression for all modes. Second, we successfully demonstrated unique spatial-mode
multiplexed vectorial holography using four CVB input beams and two arbitrary analyzing polarization states to
generate eight independent images with more than 86% efficiencies.
We should stress that such devices, capable of converting a set of multiple vectorial modes to another set of vectorial
modes with arbitrary polarization profiles, are theoretically not possible with a mono-layer MS. This work, therefore,
provides the first explicit and general formalism to realize universal MIMO vectorial mode converters. Moreover, we
expect that independent wavelength-mode manipulation could also be incorporated into our device by using dispersive
meta-atoms [47, 48, 62, 65, 66]. Owing to the versatility of the presented method, it can be applied to a variety of
cases, paving the way toward the utilization of full DoFs of optical beams for diverse applications, including optical
communication, imaging, and computing.

METHODS
Metasurface design for mode multiplexer
To design the MS for mode multiplexing shown in Fig. 2a, we first numerically derived the spatial distributions of
design parameters ( α,β, and γ) required at four MS sections. The discretization spacing of the position rnin the
simulation was set to 1.2 µm (i.e., N= 250 ×300), which corresponded to twice the actual meta-atom spacing to be
fabricated (0.6 µm) to save the optimization cost. Thus, the entire device contained 900,000 (= 4 ×250×300×3)
parameters. From the thickness of the SiO 2substrate (625 µm) and the size of each MS section (300 µm), we set the
incident angle to be tan−1{300µm/(2×625µm} ∼13.5◦. For calculating the wave propagation at an oblique angle,
we employed the shifted angular spectrum method (ASM) [67]. After iterative optimization (see Supplementary Fig. 1
for the detailed flow), we obtained Fig. 2b.
We then derived the actual dimensions ( Dα, Dβ, γ′) of each meta-atom as shown in Fig. 3a to achieve the optimal
parameters given in Fig. 2b. Note that due to the oblique incidence to the MS, γdefined in Eq. (7) is not exactly the
same as the geometrical in-plane rotation angle γ′of meta-atoms. We, therefore, distinguish them using the prime
symbol. The meta-atoms were placed on a square lattice with a lattice constant of 0.6 µm, which was less than the
wavelength to avoid higher-order diffraction. Therefore, new Jones matrix profiles J(l)(r′
n) on the square grid with
0.6µm spacing ( r′
n) were obtained by interpolating the optimal Jones matrices J(l)(rn) on the 1.2- µm-spacing grid
(rn) given in Fig. 2b. Since J(l)(r′
n) is not unitary in general, we approximated it with the unitary matrix U(l)(r′
n),
which was obtained through polar decomposition of J(l)(r′
n). The Jones matrix J(Dα, Dβ, γ′) of the reflected light
from a periodic array of meta-atoms was simulated using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) [68] for s- and
p-polarization input at 1550-nm wavelength. The refractive indices of SiO 2, Si, polyimide, and Au were set to 1.444,
3.48, 1.574, and 0.38+ i10.75, respectively. Simulated Jones matrices in some parameters ( Dα, Dβ, γ′) are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 2. Using these results, we derived geometrical parameters ( Dα, Dβ, γ′) of the meta-atom at r′

Device fabrication
The fabrication flow is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. The folded MS device was fabricated on a silicon-on-quartz
(SOQ) substrate with a Si thickness of 0.57 µm. Positive EB resist (ZEP520A-7) was spin-coated, as well as the
anti-charging conductive polymer (ESPACER 300Z). The MS pattern was written on the resist using an EB writer
(ADVANTEST F7000S), the anti-charging layer was removed in de-ionized (DI) water, and the pattern was developed
in a resist developer (ZED-N50). Then, the pattern was transferred to the Si layer using RIE with SF 6and C 4F8gas,
known as the Bosch process, followed by O 2ashing process. After the polyimide (Toray LT-S5181C) was spin-coated
on the Si pattern, the device was annealed under a nitrogen atmosphere at 220◦C for 1 hour for a cure. In preliminary
experiments, we have confirmed the polyimide layer was embedded well, and the thickness of the polyimide layer on
Si was around 1 µm. Subsequently, a 200-nm-thick gold layer was deposited on the sample using a radio-frequency
(RF) sputtering process. Then, the sample was flipped and cleaned by O 2plasma ashing. The aperture patterns for
input and output were written on the spin-coated photoresist using a laser writer with the back-side alignment to
the MS patterns and then developed. Finally, mirror patterns were formed by a liftoff process after the deposition of
silver and gold layers (200 and 50 nm) using an EB evaporator.
Measurement
The laser light at 1550 nm was incident to the device from a fiber facet at an angle of 19.7◦after the input
polarization was set to Xpolarization by a polarization controller (PC). The input mode ( m) was controlled by
moving the SMF using a 6-axis fiber stage to the corresponding position. The emitted beam at the output plane
was magnified at ten times by using a 4-f system with an objective lens (Mitsutoyo: M Plan Apo NIR) and a tube
lens (Thorlabs: TTL200-S8) and imaged by an InGaAs camera (Artray: ARTCAM-991SWIR). To image the output
intensity profiles for XandYpolarization, we inserted a polarizer.15
Performance metrics for MDM dual-polarization coherent receiver
Coupling coefficients
We define the coupling coefficient to an output spot at the u-th row ( u= 1,2,3, and 4, corresponding to relative
phase shifts of 0, π,π/2, and 3 π/2) and the v-th column ( v= 1,2, . . . , 6) with X-polarization as

m⟩is the X-polarized output field at rnfor the m-th input mode.
Insertion loss
The total insertion loss (IL) for the m-th mode signal is derived from the sum of the coupling efficiencies to the
four corresponding spots. We thus define IL as
ILm≡1/4/summationdisplay
u=1|cu,v=m,m|2. (17)
For the LO ( m= 7), IL is defined as
ILLO≡1/4/summationdisplay
u=16/summationdisplay
v=1|cu,v,m =7|2. (18)
Phase error
The phase error for the m-th mode signal is defined as the deviation from the ideal case of a 90◦optical hybrid,
which has π/2 phase difference between the in-phase and quadrature components [31]. We thus have
|∆ϕm| ≡ |∠(c4,m,m−c3,m,m)−∠(c2,m,m−c1,m,m)−π/2|. (19)
For the LO beam, the phase error in the output spots for the m-th mode is written as
|∆ϕLO,m| ≡ |∠(c4,m,m +c3,m,m)−∠(c2,m,m +c1,m,m)|. (20)
Then, we define the phase error for the LO as
|∆ϕLO| ≡ max
m∈{1,2,...,6}|∆ϕLO,m|. (21)
Power imbalance
The power imbalance for the m-th mode signal is defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum values
of the coupling efficiencies at the four spots in the corresponding column:
ξm≡max
u|cu,v=m,m|2
min
u|cu,v=m,m|2. (22)
For the LO, the imbalance in the output spots for the m-th mode is written as
ξLO,m≡max
u|cu,v=m,m =7|2

u|cu,v=m,m =7|2. (23)
Then, we define the imbalance for the LO as
ξLO≡ max

Supplementary Note 2. MEASUREMENT OF COMPLEX FIELD PROFILES AND COUPLING
MATRIX USING OFF-AXIS HOLOGRAPHY
To characterize the complex field profile of the output beam from the mode multiplexer, we employed the off-axis
holography method. The measurement setup is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4(a). A continuous wave (CW) from
a tunable laser source (TLS) at 1550 nm was split to the signal and reference paths through the 50/50 coupler.
The signal light was incident to the device after the input polarization was set to Xpolarization by a polarization
controller (PC). The position and angle of input SMF were controlled by a 6-axis fiber stage. The signal at the output
plane was magnified at ten times using a 4-f system with an objective lens (Mitsutoyo: M Plan Apo NIR) and a tube
lens (Thorlabs: TTL200-S8). Then, it was combined with the reference beam at a tilted angle by a beam splitter to
generate interference fringes at an InGaAs camera (Artray: ARTCAM-991SWIR). The polarization of the reference
light was switched to XorYby using a PC to select each polarization component.
From the captured fringe patterns, we retrieved the complex field profiles aout,meas
m,p (r) as shown in Supplementary
Fig. 4(b). Using these results, we calculated the coupling matrix C′, where C′
mm′=|⟨atar
m|aout,meas
m′⟩|2. Supplementary
Fig. 4(c) shows the calculated coupling matrix.
Supplementary Note 3. WAVELENGTH DEPENDENCE
We investigate the wavelength dependence of the MDM polarization-diversity coherent receiver designed in the
main text. Supplementary Fig. 6 shows the simulated performances as a function of wavelength. Here, we ignore the
wavelength dependence of each meta-atom, which is a valid assumption for the wavelength range (1530-1570 nm) of
our interest. Insertion loss, phase error, power imbalance, and crosstalk are suppressed below 3.5 dB, 11◦, 2.1 dB,
and –19 dB at all wavelengths from 1530 to 1570 nm. These wavelength dependencies are expected to be improved
further by employing the optimization at multiple wavelengths simultaneously.
Supplementary Note 4. DEPENDENCE OF THE NUMBER OF METASURFACE LAYERS
We investigate the dependence of the number of metasurface layers on the performance of the MDM polarization-
diversity coherent receiver. Supplementary Fig. 7 shows the simulated performances as a function of the number of
metasurface layers. We can confirm that the performance generally improves by increasing the metasurface layers L.
In practice, however, optical insertion loss and sensitivity to fabrication errors increase as we increase the number of
layers. There is, therefore, an optimal number of layers to maximize performance under actual conditions.3

Supplementary Fig. 1. Optimization flow of deriving the metasurface parameters. Initially, the MS parameters of
α(l)(rn),β(l)(rn) and γ(l)(rn) are uniformly set to 0, π/2, and π/4, respectively, to prevent zero gradients in this
work. In each iteration of optimization, we first calculate |a(l)
m⟩for each mode by computing the forward propagation
given by Eq. (3) and derive Eusing Eq. (9). Similarly, back-propagated fields |b(l)
m⟩are obtained by computing
Eq. (14). Here, we use the angular spectrum method (ASM) [1, 2] in the calculation of the free-space propagation.
Then,∂E
∂θ(l)(rn)are calculated using Eq. (13). Finally, we update the parameters through Eq. (12). In this work, we
use the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) algorithm [3] as an optimizer for efficient updating of parameters.
These procedures are repeated until the objective function converges4
