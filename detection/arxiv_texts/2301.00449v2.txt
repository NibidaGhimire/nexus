The eects of magnetic elds on accretion disks around compact objects are of high importance
in the study of their general properties and dynamics. Here we analyze the inuence of magnetic
elds on thick accretion disks around rotating boson stars. We assume a uniform constant specic
angular momentum distribution and a polytropic equation of state. The purely hydrodynamical
thick disk solutions are extended to magnetized solutions by adding a toroidal magnetic eld and
then analyzed in terms of a magnetization parameter mc. We consider one-centered solutions as
well as two-centered solutions and focus on retrograde tori, since they are more distinctive due to
their unique properties. Our computed solutions indicate that strong magnetic elds inuence the
characteristics of thick disks around rotating boson stars and possibly aect their unique features.
1. INTRODUCTION
Accretion disks are formed around various astrophysical objects ranging from supermassive active galactic nuclei
to coalescent stellar mass black holes and neutron star binaries. Converting gravitational energy into radiation they
harbor many high-energy astrophysical phenomena and thus can serve as a natural arena for probing the gravitational
physics around compact objects. With the development of the imaging techniques we are now able to observe directly
the accretion disks in the nearby galactic targets M87 and Sgr A*, which provides a unique opportunity for gaining
knowledge about the nature of the compact objects in their centers and the physical processes in the accreting plasma
[1{3].
The interpretation of the astrophysical observations relies considerably on the accretion disk modeling. Currently
general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations are developed which are able to integrate numeri-
cally the coupled Einstein-Euler equations thus providing a precise description of the self-gravitating accreting system.
Although the computations can be simplied by assuming axial symmetry or using a test-uid approximation, these
simulations produce a complicated picture depending on many parameters which can be hard to disentangle and
interpret. In this respect simplied semi-analytical models can be extremely useful since they may capture the main
eects from the non-linear treatment with less computational cost and oer more physical intuition and predictability.
Some of the basic constructions which describe geometrically thick accretion disks are the so called Polish doughnuts .
They represent the simplest solutions to the relativistic Euler equations assuming a non-selfgravitating perfect uid
and neglecting the electromagnetic, viscosity and radiation terms. Thus, they provide the equilibrium states of the
relativistic matter orbiting on non-geodesic trajectories around the compact object, which result from the balance of
the pressure gradients and the gravitational and centrifugal forces.
The theory of the equilibrium tori has a long history dating back to the classical works [4{6] where the equilibrium
tori for the Kerr black hole were obtained. Assuming an isentropic or barotropic equation of state for the perfect uid
it was demonstrated that in this case the constant angular velocity and the constant angular momentum surfaces
coincide. This statement, known as the von Zeipel theorem, represents an integrability condition for the relativistic
Euler equation and therefore it allows the construction of analytical solutions.
Various equilibrium tori can be constructed possessing a dierent prole of the specic angular momentum [7, 8].
Solutions with a constant angular momentum play a fundamental role since despite their simplicity they already

capture the main qualitative features of the more general congurations. The physical conditions can be further
extended by adding a toroidal magnetic eld which allows for the construction of analytical solutions under the
same integrability conditions [9] (see also [10] and [11] for non-constant angular momentum congurations). This
generalization is particularly important for the astrophysical applications since magnetic elds play a dynamical role
in astrophysical scenarios and the magnetized equilibrium congurations provide suitable initial conditions for the
GRMHD simulations of the accretion process or jet formation (see e. g. [12, 13]). Magnetized tori can be further
generalized by including shear viscosity eects [14].
Although the accretion disk theory was developed considering mainly the Kerr black hole, fundamental physics
suggests that more diverse compact objects may exist in nature. This motivates the construction of accretion disk
models in more exotic spacetimes with the view of confronting the simulations with observational data and searching
for astrophysical signatures of new fundamental objects [15{18]. In this line of research thick accretion disks around
black holes in the modied theories of gravity were studied [19{22], equilibrium congurations in de Sitter background
[23, 24] or interacting with an external matter distribution [25, 26], as well as thick disks in naked singularity spacetimes
[27, 28].
In our work we concentrate on boson stars. Boson stars represent compact scalar eld condensates which form as
equilibrium states resulting from the gravitational collapse of a self-gravitating massive scalar eld [29{31]. They
produce a strong gravitational eld and negligible electromagnetic emission, in this way they are mimicking the
properties of black holes. Various boson star congurations have been constructed [32{41], and their properties were
investigated such as stability [42{45], geodesic motion [46{51] and tidal eects in the motion of gas clouds around
them [52, 53]. Since they are horizonless compact objects, which are not characterized by a solid boundary but rather
by a decaying prole of the scalar eld density towards innity, the particles and light propagation in their vicinity
is specic leading to phenomenological signatures. For example, boson stars may possess only bound circular orbits
which extend into the inner regions with high density of the scalar eld distribution [49]. In addition, photon rings
may be absent which prevents the formation of a shadow in the strict sense. Yet, if we assume the presence of an
accretion disk, a central dark region will be observed similar to black holes which corresponds to the lensed image of
an accretion disk's inner edge [15{18].
The perfect uid equilibrium tori around boson stars also possess distinctive morphology compared to the Kerr black
hole [49, 54]. The equilibrium tori in the Kerr spacetime are characterized by two dierent types of solutions, which
are distinguished by the presence of a cusp located at the inner edge. Solutions with a cusp emerge if the specic
angular momentum of the disk lies between the specic angular momenta corresponding to the marginally stable
and the marginally bound orbit [5, 55]. In contrast, the equilibrium congurations for boson stars constructed in
the literature do not form an inner cusp. This distinction has implications on the possible scenarios for dynamical
evolution of the accretion disk such as the formation of run-away instabilities [8, 55, 56]. Boson stars can further
support topologically non-trivial congurations like two-centered tori which can be disjoint or connected by a cusp.
These topologies are absent for the Kerr black hole, although they occur for other exotic compact objects like naked
singularities [23, 24]. Another interesting feature is the formation of static surfaces for counter-rotating equilibrium
tori around boson stars [40, 54]. These surfaces are dened as the cross-sections where the uid is at rest with respect
to a zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO) at innity. Thus, they serve as a boundary separating regions where
the uid moves in prograde and retrograde direction, respectively.
The aim of our work is to study the equilibrium tori in boson star spacetimes in the presence of a toroidal magnetic eld.
We construct constant angular momentum congurations and analyse how their properties are modied with respect
to the purely hydrodynamical case. In particular we describe the qualitative eects which are induced by the magnetic
eld and may have observational implications. These include modications in the location of the predominant disk
density and its compactness, as well as variation of the characteristic geometry of the equidensity surfaces. Another
interesting phenomenon is that the magnetic eld can trigger topological transitions between dierent thick disk
congurations. Thus, after a certain magnitude of the magnetic eld, two-centered disks may lose their outer center
and become one-centered.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe the boson star solutions which we consider and
some of their relevant properties. In section 3 we briey review the equilibrium tori congurations, which are possible
in boson star spacetimes in the purely hydrodynamical case. In section 4 we describe the construction procedure
of magnetized tori for a perfect uid with polytropic equation of state. In section 5 we present our results and the
analysis of the properties of the magnetized thick disk, which are illustrated on a range of representative examples.
Section 6 contains our conclusions.3
2. BOSON STARS
We consider a complex scalar eld without self-interaction. The boson stars (BSs) are obtained from the Einstein-
Klein-Gordon equations, derived from the action S

and a conserved Noether charge Q, which is the bosonic particle number given by Q=Rp gjtd3x.
The variation of the action (1) leads to the coupled set of Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations,

A harmonic time-dependence is already needed for the classical non-rotating BSs in order to obtain stable localized
solutions. The presence of rotation implies an additional harmonic dependence of the scalar eld on the azimuthal

Due to the condition ('= 0) =('= 2) the winding number kmust be an integer ( ksignals the strength of
the angular excitations since it counts the nodes, 2 k, of the real and imaginary parts of the scalar eld along the
azimuthal direction).
The angular momentum Jof the BSs is given by a quantisation law [37],
J=kQ; (7)
thus it is an integer multiple of the charge Q. This law follows directly from the relation Tt
'= kjtwith@'= ik.
The harmonic Ansatz for the scalar eld yields a stress-energy tensor that does not depend on the coordinates tand
'. Thus solutions with a stationary and axially symmetric metric result, implying the presence of two Killing vectors
of the metric associated with these two coordinates. The line element of the BS spacetime metric can then be written
as,

Substituting the harmonic Ansatz (6) into the eld equations leads to a coupled set of partial dierential equations for
the functions, which were solved numerically. The BSs constructed are asymptotically at.Thus the metric approaches
asymptotically Minkowski spacetime and the scalar eld vanishes exponentially proportional to e p
m2 !2r=r. The
solutions were computed with the FIDISOL/CADSOL package, which is a PDE solver which employs a nite dier-
ence method of discretization together with a Newton-Raphson scheme to linearize the resulting system of algebraic
equations [57]. Solutions exist only for a set of angular frequencies !.4

Here we consider only rotating BSs with winding number k= 1. Furthermore, we focus only on solutions without
ergoregions. Therefore the minimal angular frequency taken into account is != 0:655. Solutions with smaller angular
frequencies would possess ergoregions [48]. It should be noted, that the equations feature a scaling symmetry, which
we exploit to go to dimensionless quantities by scaling with the boson mass m, i.e., ~r=rm, ~!=!
mand ~M=Mm.
In the following we omit the tilde again for brevity.
The solutions with lower angular frequencies !are more relativistic solutions, whereas the angular frequencies near 1
are close to vacuum solutions. Since the amplitude of the scalar eld becomes higher for lower angular frequencies
and for small values of the radial coordinate r, the corresponding accretion disk solutions can be more compact and
located closer to the center compared to those of BSs with higher angular frequencies.
3. EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL AND KEPLERIAN ANGULAR MOMENTUM
Unmagnetized thick disks can be computed from an eective potential W, which acts as a combination of the gravi-
tational and centrifugal potential of a uid particle rotating around a central gravitating object. Wcan be derived by
integrating the relativistic Euler equations and assuming the von Zeipel theorem as a necessary integrability condition,

withutas the covariant four-velocity (and  utthe mass-normalized energy), `the specic angular momentum, the
rest-mass density, hthe specic enthalpy and pthe thermodynamic pressure. The eective potential at the inner edge
of the disk,Win, is taken as a free parameter, as its value determines the boundary of the disk. Choosing Win<0
leads to tori for which the outermost equipotential surface is closed, while Win>0 represents open equipotential
surfaces. In this work we choose Win= 0 which corresponds to an equipotential surface closed at innity. Assuming a
constant specic angular momentum distribution the integral term containing `vanishes, and by assuming furthermore
a polytropic equation of state, p=K , withKand   being the polytropic constant and exponent, the rest-mass
density can be rewritten to

wheredepends only onW.
The equidensity surfaces coincide with the equipotential surfaces and therefore the disk geometry can be studied
by analyzing the eective potential. The location of the accretion disk center rcis given by the maximum of the
rest-mass density and therefore the minimum of W. A local maximum of Wcorresponds to a self-intersection of an
equipotential surface and is called a cusp. Since@W
@rj(r=frc;rcuspg;=
2)= 0 the motion at the accretion disk center and
at the accretion disk cusp follows a geodesic on the equatorial plane. Due to the axisymmetry of the BS spacetime,
the geodesic corresponds to a Keplerian circular orbit. The specic angular momentum `at the center and cusp is
therefore identical to the Keplerian specic angular momentum `K. Considering the von Zeipel theorem, the specic
angular momentum `can be expressed as,

Some of the retrograde accretion disk solutions, possess locations where the uid stays at rest for a ZAMO at innity.
Those locations are called static surfaces and are dened by the three dimensional generalization of the so called6
static rings, which represent orbits remaining at rest [51]. They are realised in the shape of toroidal surfaces located
inside the accretion disk. Outside of the surfaces the uid ows in a retrograde motion, while inside these surfaces
the uid ows in a prograde motion. Since the uid stays at rest at these surfaces, the angular velocity 
 is zero and
therefore the specic angular momentum at the surface is given by the rest specic angular momentum `r:= gt

Disk solutions containing static surfaces occur when 9r:`0=`r(r). Fig. 3 shows the equatorial rest specic angular
momentum distribution for various BS solutions.

The rest specic angular momentum is signicantly smaller for the less relativistic BS solutions, therefore static
surfaces are more likely to appear for the more relativistic BSs.
4. MAGNETIZED THICK DISKS
In order to construct magnetized torus solutions we follow the procedure employed in [9, 19]. We extend the hydro-
dynamical thick disk model by adding a toroidal magnetic eld. The fundamental conservation laws of relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics need to be solved under the assumption,

Since eq. (22) is a transcendental equation for the rest-mass density , it needs to be solved numerically at every

non-magnetized disk to c= 1, while in the case of two-centered solutions the densest center will be chosen. Rewriting
eq. (22) with respect to the torus center and expressing the specic enthalpy hin terms of the rest-mass density, we

of= 10 15between the last and second to last iteration step.8
5. RESULTS
We now present our results for magnetized thick tori, discussing rst the one-centered disks and then the two-centered
ones. The selected BS solutions are based on [54] and intended to be exemplary for the spectrum of possible disk
types. For less relativistic BS solutions != 0:960 was chosen, for mildly and highly relativistic != 0:798 and
!= 0:671. To conduct a more comprehensible analysis of the magnetized disks, we dene the density center and
the density cusp of a disk solution as the radial location where the equatorial density has a local maximum and
local minimum, respectively. The density and thermodynamic pressure gradients vanish at these locations. Since the
eective potential is not aected by the magnetization parameter, density center and density cusp only coincide in
non-magnetized solutions with the accretion disk center and disk cusp dened by the minima and maxima of the
eective potential. Therefore we will from now on distinguish between them in the magnetized solutions and refer
withrcto the density center and with rcuspto the density cusp. In pursuit of a more precise study of the one-centered
solutions we dene an eective equatorial columnar radius ~Rand the corresponding mean equatorial columnar density

5.1. One-centered Disks
For the one-centered disks the selected solutions are: A.!= 0:960;`0= 4:5M,B.!= 0:960;`0= 0:1M, and

dashed horizontal line illustrates the chosen `0value. The lower part of the gures shows the corresponding eective potential
W. Black vertical lines indicate the radial location of the disk and (non-magnetized) density center.
A.!= 0:960;`0= 4:5M: This solution is representative for the less relativistic BS solutions, the accretion
disk consists of an one-centered far-reaching torus, since the slope of the density curve attens with increasing radial
value (Fig. 5). The density center is represented by the maximum of the density curves. With higher magnetization
the maximum density increases and the location of the density center shifts closer to the center of the BS. For all
radial values smaller than the disk center for the non-magnetized case, the density of the magnetized disks is higher
compared to the non-magnetized solution. In contrast to this, the density in the magnetized solutions becomes smaller
for larger values of rcompared to the non-magnetized case, scaling up to several orders of magnitude dierence for
large values of r. The eective equatorial columnar radius ~Rdecreases with a higher magnetisation, implying a more
compact mass distribution, whereas the mean equatorial columnar density  remains similar, which is a consequence
of the denser center and steeper slope of the density curve. As seen in Fig. 6, the disk gets compressed for a strong
magnetization, leading to a more elliptic shape of the equidensity surfaces. Most of the accretion disk mass is located9
in a smaller volume around the disk center, since the mass distribution decreases even more rapidly with increasing
magnetization. We conclude that strong magnetic elds lead to a compactication of the torus, while the general
shape and geometry of the torus is preserved for the less relativistic BS solutions.
B.!= 0:960;`0= 0:1M: This example represents a special set of solutions, which are also known as fat tori ,
they occur for small values of the specic angular momentum. Since the specic angular momentum is suciently
small in these solutions, the tori are capable of possessing static surfaces. As seen in Fig. 7 the density center for
strongly magnetized disks is located closer to the center of the BS and the maximum density is approximately two
orders of magnitude higher compared to the maximum density of the non-magnetized disk. The mean columnar
density and eective columnar radius ~Rare signicantly higher/lower for the strong magnetized case, indicating
a very compressed disk and a more longitudinal mass distribution. Furthermore the density at the static surface
decreases, resulting in less matter located inside and at the static surface. In the magnetized solution the static
surface lies completely outside the volume in which approximately 50% of the mass is contained (Fig. 8). As seen
in Fig. 8 strong magnetic elds compress the equidensity surfaces parallel to the equatorial plane in the direction of
the BS center, resulting in extremal tori with a cylindrical shape centered around the rotational axis. The geometry
mimics a sharp ellipsoid centered around the BS center, where most of the mass is located close to the BS center
and alongside the rotational axis. We conclude that strong magnetic elds have a signicant eect on fat tori, highly
compactifying and elongating them alongside the rotational axis.
C.!= 0:798;`0= 0:4666M: For the mildly relativistic BS solutions the non-magnetized disk is already relatively
compact compared to the previous solutions and located close to the center of the BS. The static surface is located
close to the disk center, with the inner intersection with the equatorial plane being located at the disk center. As
in the other solutions, magnetization compresses the disk leading to a higher density around the torus center and
a shift towards the BS center. This shift is relatively small, since the non-magnetized center location is already
close to the BS center. The decrease of ~Rand increase of  indicate again a further compactication and elongated
density distribution (Fig. 9). The density at the outer intersection of the static surface with the equatorial plane is
approximately one order of magnitude lower compared to the non-magnetized solution (Fig. 9), in the high magnetized
case it lies only partially in the volume which contains half the accretion disk mass, as shown in Fig. 10. In general
the disk gets characteristically more compressed, with sharp edged contour lines forming equidensity surfaces with a
smaller diameter, resulting in a torus geometry similar to a sharp ellipsoid which is centered around the BS center
with most of the mass located close to the center (Fig. 10).10

5.2. Two-centered Disks
In contrast to the Kerr black hole, it is possible for mildly and highly relativistic BSs to shelter accretion disk solutions
with more than one center (albeit solutions with two centers are shown to exist for Kerr black holes with scalar hair
[21, 22]). These two-centered solutions dier quite strongly from those analyzed so far, they either possess a cusp,
which connects the two centers of the disk or they have no cusp. In the latter case the accretion disk consists of
two separated tori, one inner torus and one outer torus. For the two-centered disks we have selected the following
4 representative examples: A.!= 0:798;`0= 4:5M,B.!= 0:671;`0= 4:5M,C.!= 0:671;`0= 5Mand
D.!= 0:798;`0= 4:75M. Fig. 11 illustrates the normalized Keplerian specic angular momentum and eective
potential of these solutions.
(a)!= 0:798;`0= 4:5M
 (b)!= 0:671;`0= 4:5M
 (c)!= 0:671;`0= 5M
(d)!= 0:798;`0= 4:75M
Fig. 11. The upper part of the gures shows the normalized Keplerian specic angular momentum ` 
K, black curve sections
represent the radial coordinates for which only unbound orbits are possible. Dashed horizontal lines illustrate the chosen `0
value. The lower part of the gures shows the corresponding eective potential W. Solid vertical lines indicate the disk and
(non-magnetized) density center locations, with rcias the inner disk and density center and rcoas the outer disk and density
center. Dotted vertical lines indicate the position of the cusp.
A.!= 0:798;`0= 4:5M: This solution is in the non-magnetized case composed of a two-centered disk connected
by a cusp. As shown in Fig. 12, the equatorial density of the mildly and strong magnetized solution only possesses
one maximum and no minimum. Therefore the density cusp and outer density center vanish, resulting in a change
of disk morphology from a two-torus solution to a one-torus solution. For all radial values greater than the inner
disk center of the non-magnetized solution, the density is monotonically decreasing in correspondence to the magne-
tization parameter. Since the local extreme points vanish for strongly magnetized disks, there must be a threshold
value0, below which only one-torus solutions exist, the disk topology is therefore dependent on the magnetization
parameter. Fig. 13 shows an analysis of density curves for magnetization parameters close to this threshold value.
The density cusp and outer density center converge to one location for the threshold value 01:757, which marks
a saddle point of the density curve (Fig. 13 (b)). As seen in Fig. 14 the disk gets compactied towards the inner
density center and the contour lines of the equidensity surfaces close to the center are of circular shape and smaller in
diameter compared to the contour lines of lower density, which have a greater extent and possess a teardrop-like shape.17
B.!= 0:671;`0= 4:5M:The solution presented in Fig. 15 is highly relativistic and composed of a two-centered
disk connected by a cusp with a static surface. A high magnetization does not aect the torus geometry around the
inner center considerably. Similar to the other solutions it gets denser and more compressed, thus the density center
is located closer to the BS center as compared to the non-magnetized case. In contrast, the geometry around the cusp
and outer center is more aected by strong magnetic elds. The density cusp is located slightly further away from
the BS center, whereas the outer density center moves closer to it, therefore the distance between density cusp and
outer center decreases signicantly, as shown in Fig. 16. The distance between them converges for low magnetization
parameters to  rrco rcusp= 1:09. Furthermore the corresponding density values are similar for a high magneti-
zation. The dierence between them converges to  c0 cusp= 6:9310 10. Since the dierence of the densities
is signicantly small, the physical properties of the disk between density cusp and outer center would be similar,
leaving it hard to distinguish between them. It should be noted that the density in general is very small around the
outer torus center, having a magnitude around 10 7in the strong magnetized case. Equidensity surfaces around the
outer center become smaller in diameter for a low magnetization parameter, as seen in Fig. 17. In general we con-
clude that strong magnetic elds are suppressing the outer density center. Since the static surface is located close to
the inner density center, the properties in and at the static surface are only slightly inuenced by strong magnetization.
C.!= 0:671;`0= 5M:Considering the same BS solution as in example B. and setting the specic angular
momentum to `0= 5Mleads to a two-centered solution without a cusp, as presented in Fig. 18. The outer density
center moves closer to the BS center for a low magnetization parameter and the density values of the outer torus are
for the most part more than two orders of magnitude lower compared to the non-magnetized case, meaning there is
almost no matter in the outer torus (in comparison to the inner torus), with density levels around 10 9(Fig. 17).
The inner torus with the static surface behaves similarly to the solution with the cusp.
D.!= 0:798;`0= 4:75M:Looking at the != 0:798 BS solution, there exist also two-centered solutions with
a cusp, which are composed of a denser outer disk center, as seen in Fig. 20. In the high magnetized solution the
inner density center as well as the outer density center become denser compared to the non-magnetized solution,
with the inner one being denser than the outer one. For all radial values smaller than the outer disk center of the
non-magnetized solution, the equatorial density of the magnetized disks is higher compared to the non-magnetized
solution. As a consequence there are higher density values at and around the density cusp. Fig. 22 shows the
two-dimensional density distribution. The locations of the inner density center and density cusp are not signicantly
inuenced by strong magnetization. The outer density center moves closer to the BS center and the cusp. Considering
that the inner center becomes denser for a strong magnetization, there must be a threshold value 0, below which the
outer center has lower density. Fig. 21 presents solutions close to this threshold value. Since 0marks the intersection
between the density of the inner and outer center, a two-centered magnetized disk solution with the same density at
both centers is possible for this magnetization parameter.18

6. CONCLUSION
In this work we investigate the properties of non-selfgravitating magnetized thick disks in rotating boson star space-
times. For the boson stars we here employ a massive complex scalar eld without self-interactions, minimally coupled
to gravity. For such rotating boson stars a nonaxisymmetric dynamical instability has been found in [44]. However,
when the boson star frequency !approaches its upper limit given by the boson mass m, the growth rate of this insta-
bility scales like/(1 !=m), and thus the growth rate approaches zero in the Newtonian limit [45]. Furthermore,
when appropriate nonlinear scalar self-interactions of the scalar eld are included also the instability of the boson
stars on the relativistic branch is quenched [45]. Thus also highly compact rotating boson stars may be dynamically
stable on relevant astrophysical scales, and possibly exhibit similar features for magnetized accretion disks as the ones
observed here.
We construct the equilibrium congurations as solutions to the relativistic Euler equations assuming the presence
of a toroidal magnetic eld and constant angular momentum of the disk. We further describe the accreting plasma
by a perfect uid with polytropic equation of state. The inuence of the magnetic eld is evaluated by considering
models with dierent degree of magnetization quantied by the ratio of the thermal and magnetic pressure, which
serves as a magnetization parameter. In order to compare to the purely hydrodynamical case we choose several
representative boson star solutions ranging from less to highly relativistic, which are characterized by a qualitatively
dierent morphology of the equilibrium tori. Then we analyse the impact of the magnetic eld by exploring certain
distinctive features such as modications in the disk compactness, location of the density cusps and density centers,
distribution of the predominant uid density, transitions in the geometry or topology of the equilibrium congurations.
We observe the following systematic behavior. Mildly and less relativistic boson stars, which in the purely hydrody-
namical case support equilibrium tori with a single center and no cusp preserve the disk morphology when a magnetic
eld is present. However, when the magnetization increases the disks become more compact and the predominant
matter distribution shifts inwards towards the boson star center. This is manifested quantitatively by a range of
features. In particular, the location of the density center moves closer to the boson star, the maximum density of
the torus increases, and the predominant uid density concentrates in smaller regions of the disk. In addition, for
strong magnetic elds the disk can become highly compressed towards the rotational axis and the geometry of the
equidensity surfaces can change from oblate to prolate. Due to the steep density gradients, these solutions could be
unstable when time-evolved. In general the described eects are consistent with the studies of magnetized equilibrium
tori around black holes, where similar qualitative behavior is observed [19, 20].
In the case of highly relativistic boson stars we observe some qualitatively new features induced by the magnetic
eld. In the purely hydrodynamical case these solutions are characterized by two-centered equilibrium tori which
can be either disjoint or connected by a cusp. We demonstrate that a suciently strong magnetic eld can cause
a transition in the disk topology. After a certain critical value of the magnetization parameter, some congurations
lose their outer density center and become one-torus solutions. For other congurations the outer density center
does not disintegrate in the strict sense but it moves inwards and the uid density decreases so much in this region
that it becomes insignicant. In these cases the ratio of the maximum uid density at the inner and outer density
center reaches eight orders of magnitude. Another phenomenon which we observed is a shift of the predominant uid
density between the torus centers. Congurations in which the uid density is concentrated at the outer center in
the purely hydrodynamical case can turn into congurations with dominant matter distribution at the inner center
under a suciently strong magnetic eld. The described eects can be interpreted as a manifestation of the same
physical behavior as for the mildly relativistic boson stars. They illustrate further the trend that the presence of
magnetic eld leads to denser and more strongly compactied equilibrium congurations which are concentrated
closer to the gravitational eld center. The non-linear evolution of the described equilibrium tori and their impact as
initial conditions for the GRMHD simulations may be subject to further investigations.
