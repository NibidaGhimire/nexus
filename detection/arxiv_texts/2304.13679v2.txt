A major challenge in the study of active matter lies in quantitative characterization of
phases and transitions between them. We show how the entropy of a collection of active
objects can be used to classify regimes and spatial patterns in their collective behavior.
Specifically, we estimate the contributions to the total entropy from correlations between
the degrees of freedom of position and orientation. This analysis pin-points the flocking
transition in the Vicsek model while clarifying the physical mechanism behind the transi-
tion. When applied to experiments on swarming Bacillus subtilis with different cell aspect
ratios and overall bacterial area fractions, the entropy analysis reveals a rich phase diagram
with transitions between qualitatively different swarm statistics. We discuss physical and
biological implications of these findings.
I. INTRODUCTION
Active matter is composed of motile objects which continuously consume energy to generate
propulsion [1, 2]. Such systems have been extensively studied in the past two decades. They are of
particular relevance to biology, describing the collective motions of a wide variety of entities [3],
ranging from swarming bacteria [4, 5] and migrating cells [6] to flocks of birds [7], marching
locusts [8], and human crowds [9]. Numerous types of inanimate particles, such as light-activated
∗arielg@math.biu.ac.ilarXiv:2304.13679v2  [cond-mat.soft]  18 Jun 20232
colloids [10] and chemically-activated diffusiophoretic particles [11], exhibit similar behaviors.
With its perpetual energy dissipation, active matter provides examples of far-from-equilibrium
steady states with intriguing statistical-mechanical aspects [1, 2, 12, 13]. These include: (a) break-
down and modification of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [13–15]; (b) giant number fluctua-
tions and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem [1, 2, 16]; and (c) the inadequacy of temper-
ature [17, 18], pressure [19, 20], and chemical potential [12, 18] as thermodynamic state variables.
In contrast, entropy remains well-defined out of equilibrium through its connection to informa-
tion. The entropy quantifies the information content of the system’s statistics through Shannon’s
formula [21],
H=−X
XpXlnpX=−Z
dXp(X) lnp(X), (1)
where pX(p(X)) is the probability (density function) to obtain the discrete (continuous) microstate
X. Entropy-based considerations have been effective for identifying and characterizing changes in
material properties, e.g., in equilibrium phase transitions [22–24], pattern formation [25], and self-
assembly [26]. Yet, they have rarely been applied to active systems. The main reason is seemingly
technical — estimation of entropy out of equilibrium has proven challenging. Direct sampling of
p(X)to be used in Eq. (1) is often either inapplicable or unreliable in high-dimensional, continuous
phase spaces (see, for example, Refs. [27–29]). As a result, there is an ongoing effort to find
reliable entropy estimators, in particular, for experimental data [30–35].
Several earlier works considered aspects of entropy (or effective free energy) of active systems.
Some involved coarse-grained theories based on stochastic equations [36–39]. Another work used
entropy estimation of interlaced frames using the lossless-compression method [40], thus also
incorporating temporal information. Lastly, a dynamical inference approach addressed both the
static and dynamic (caliber) entropies, which were maximized under the constraint of a given
orientations correlation function (CF) [41]. Interestingly, in the latter, the estimation based only
on steady-state entropy (relying on spatial correlations) failed to describe real bird flocks. The
current work builds on the structure-based entropy inference presented in Refs. [34, 35]. The
method has been successfully applied to several non-equilibrium systems. Here we apply it to two
active systems.
Recent works on active matter have dealt with entropy production (e.g., Refs. [13, 42–45]).
While entropy is a state property, not requiring a unit of time, entropy production is a dynamic
quantity related to the heat dissipation per unit time. Out of equilibrium energy may constantly3
flow into the system, and heat dissipation (i.e., entropy production) is necessary to sustain a steady
state. At that steady state, properties such as the entropy are constant. In this context, other forms
of dynamical entropy approaches are worth mentioning, such as estimating the ϵ-entropy and the
Kolmogorov-Sinai entorpy [46], the maximum-caliber principle [41, 47], and using the entropy as
a Lyapunov function [48]. Here we concentrate only on the steady-state entropy, associated with
the steady-state distribution of microstates (e.g., positions and orientations).
Significant theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted to obtaining phase diagrams
of active matter, i.e., characterizing the observed regimes and transitions between them. In most
cases an appropriate order parameter (OP) is defined and measured or calculated. However, espe-
cially in active matter, a single OP or a few OPs may not capture the entire behavior of interest.
For example, common OPs relate to the particles’ orientations or velocities and do not reflect the
details of their spatial arrangement, let alone more subtle cross-correlations between orientations
and positions. This is despite the fact that spatial heterogeneities are known to play a major role
in active systems [1, 2, 12]. Indeed, different observables and statistical attributes, such as cluster
size distributions, have been used. Such attributes (e.g., the cluster size) are not always sharply
defined [4, 16, 49, 50].
Correlation functions are well-defined higher-level descriptors of particle arrangement com-
pared to mean OPs. They are applicable out of equilibrium and routinely extracted from exper-
iments and simulations. We focus on the information content (entropy) of CFs, following the
approach of Refs. [34, 35]. The idea is to measure or compute different pair correlation functions
corresponding to different degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the particles. Using these (Fourier-
transformed) CFs as constraints, we apply the functional developed in Refs. [34, 35] to obtain an
upper bound for the system’s entropy. In other words, we estimate how much information has
been gained by measuring the CF. By constraining different CFs, or their combinations, one can
identify the DOFs that dominate a certain regime or transition [35]. We will specifically use the
two-point position CF (i.e., the structure factor) and the orientations CF.
In the following Sec. II we specialize the method to the systems studied here — particles mov-
ing in two dimensions (2D) whose DOFs are position and orientation (either polar or nematic).
In Sec. III we apply the method to the Vicsek model [51], a canonical minimal model where the
particles are cognizant of their neighbors’ velocity direction in the presence of uniform noise.
This model is known to exhibit a flocking transition with decreasing noise. In Sec. IV we use the
method to re-analyze experiments on swarming bacteria [4]. The experiments have shown that4
elongated mutants undergo a swarming transition with qualitatively different dynamics compared
to the native, less elongated bacteria. We discuss our findings and future perspectives in Sec. V.
II. METHOD
The two systems of interest consist of Nparticles in 2D, whose DOFs are their positions {rn=
(xn, yn)}and orientations {θn}. Both systems are known to exhibit transitions involving changes
in the spatial and orientational arrangements of the particles.
For the positions, the typical two-point CF is the structure factor,
S(q) =*
1
NNX
n=1NX
m=1e−iq·(rn−rm)+
, (2)
which is the Fourier-transformed two-point correlation of the particle number density. The angular
brackets denote an ensemble average (over samples), and the factor N−1ensures that S(q) = 1
in the ideal-gas limit (uncorrelated positions). This factor appears inside the brackets to treat
cases where the number of particles varies between samples (as in Sec. IV). The wavevector q
is discretized by the system’s size (box of side L) according toP
q(·) = ( L/2π)2R
dq(·). The
uniform mode ( q=0) is excluded throughout.
Similar to the case of particle number density, one can define a two-point correlation of the
orientation density field. The angle DOF can be transformed using spherical harmonics, which in
2D are Yl(θ) =eilθ,l= 0,1, . . .. In this sense, S(q)is the 0th harmonic correlator. The next
harmonic is l= 1for a polar DOF ( θ∈[−π, π)), and l= 2for a nematic DOF ( θ∈[−π/2, π/2)).
The orientations CFs are then 2×2matrices,
Dl(q) =*
2
NNX
n=1NX
m=1e−iq·(rn−rm)ˆn(lθn)ˆn†(lθm)+
, (3)
where ˆn(θ) = (cos θ,sinθ)and†denotes transpose and complex conjugation. The prefactor 2N−1
ensures that Dl(q) =Ifor an ideal gas ( Ibeing the identity matrix).
Our goal is to find the information content encoded in the CF. This is the minimal excess Shan-
non entropy with respect to the ideal gas (i.e., uniform distribution with the same mean density)
that any system can have given the measured CF. In other words, we find the maximum-entropy
model with the CF as a constraint. Following Ref. [35], we denote the excess entropy per particle,
hex=⟨(HN−Hid
N)/N⟩, where HNis the system’s entropy for Nparticles, Hid
Nis the ideal gas5
entropy for Nparticles, and the average ⟨·⟩here is over the number of particles (for example, in
analyzing the experiments with swarming bacteria below or in grand-canonical ensembles).
For homogeneous systems (i.e., no symmetry-breaking external field), the upper bound of hex
using the structure factor as the CF is given by [34]
hex[S] =1
2⟨N⟩X
q̸=0[lnS(q) + 1−S(q)]. (4)
Similarly, the entropy’s upper bound as a functional of the orientations CF is [35]
hex[Dl] =1
2⟨N⟩X
q̸=0
ln detDl(q) + 2−trDl(q)
. (5)
The lower of the two entropy bounds given by Eqs. (4) and (5) should point to the dominant DOF.
We will also use a mixed CF defined as the 3×3matrix,
M(q) =A−1*
1
NNX
n=1NX
m=1e−iq·(rn−rm)f(lθn)f†(lθm)+
, (6)
where f(θ) = (1 ,cosθ,sinθ), andA−1= diag(1 ,2,2)is the normalization matrix ( Abeing the
ideal-gas limit of the expression in angular brackets). The corresponding upper bound for the
entropy is
hex[M] =1
2⟨N⟩X
q̸=0[ln det M(q) + 3−trM(q)]. (7)
Note that M11(q)is the structure factor S(q), while the block Mij,i, j= 2,3, forms Dl(q). The
off-diagonal terms, M12(q) =M∗
21(q)andM13(q) =M∗
31(q), are the position-orientation cross-
correlations. Since the spherical harmonics form an orthogonal basis, hex[M]is guaranteed to be
smaller than both hex[S]andhex[Dl]. The maximum hex[M], obtained for uncorrelated positions
and orientations, is hex[S] +hex[Dl]. One may similarly include more CFs corresponding to
additional spherical harmonics, which will obviously reduce the entropy bound further.
III. VICSEK MODEL
The Vicsek model [51] is a minimal model for active matter, in which the dynamics of self-
propelled objects leads to collective behavior and flocking. See Fig. 1 for typical snapshots. It is
an example of the interplay between local alignment interactions and disordering noise. In this
section we apply the method described in Sec. II to simulations of the Vicsek model. We obtain6
the excess entropy for different values of system parameters and resolve the role of each DOF in
the collective dynamics.
In the Vicsek model, particle velocities {vn}have a fixed magnitude v, such that vn=
v(cosθn,sinθn). Initially (at t= 0), particle positions are uniformly distributed on a square
L×Lwith periodic boundary conditions. At each simulation time step, the orientation is up-
dated to the direction of the average velocity of all neighbors up to an interaction distance r,
tan[θn(t)] =⟨sin(θm(t))⟩|rn−rm|<r/⟨cos(θm(t))⟩|rn−rm|<r, plus added (intrinsic) noise ηn(t), uni-
formly distributed on [−ηπ, ηπ ], with η∈[0,1]. Positions are updated deterministically given the
velocities. The equations of motion are summarized as
θn(t+ 1) = θn(t) +ηn(t), (8a)
rn(t+ 1) = rn(t) +vn(θn(t)). (8b)
The control parameters are the density, ρ=N/L2, and the temperature-like noise η(where η= 0
corresponds to T= 0, and η= 1 toT→ ∞ ). Throughout this section, the values of r= 1 and
v= 0.1are fixed, and the density is controlled by changing Lat fixed N.
The order parameter (OP) is defined as θav=|⟨eiθ⟩|, with θav= 1 corresponding to perfect
orientational order, and θav= 0 to complete disorder. Upon varying ρandη, the OP shows a
transition which sharpens with increasing NandLat constant ρ[51, 52]. Most transitions in
active systems involve not only alignment but also clustering [1, 2]. The OP as defined above,
however, does not capture the spatial arrangement of particles. Common remedies are to define
clusters and study their size distribution [49, 50], or consider various CFs [53–55].
We performed simulations of the Vicsek model with N= 104particles and 100 runs for a range
of densities and noise amplitudes. From each run we took 10 snapshots interspaced by more than
the initial relaxation time, resulting in a total of 103samples. Each sample shas the configuration
{xs
n, ys
n, θs
n}(n= 1, . . . , 104). From these samples we compute three CFs according to Eqs. (4)-
(6): (a) the structure factor, S(q); (b) the polar orientations CF, D1(q); and (c) the “mixed” CF,
M(q), imposing simultaneously both S(q)andD1(q)and including also position-orientation
cross-correlations. Note that for Ksamples with Nparticles, all three CFs can be computed
inO(NK)efficiency. In particular, the double sums over Ncan be avoided by calculating for
each sampleP
ne−iq·rn,P
ne−iq·rnˆn(lθn)orP
ne−iq·rnf(θn), and multiplying by the transposed
conjugate.
The entropy contributions obtained from the three CFs, along with the OP, are shown in Fig. 27

density, the (spatial) flocking and (orientational) alignment become more pronounced. For lower noise the
transition occurs earlier. See Fig. 2 for the corresponding entropy contributions. The vertical lines separate

Fig. 2, the choice of where to put these ‘transitions lines’ would have been uncertain.
for varying densities at constant noise amplitude, and in Fig. 3 for varying noise amplitudes at
constant density. The OP increases with increasing density, as more and more particles are located
within the interaction radius. The OP decreases with increasing noise amplitude, as particle ori-
entations become less and less correlated. These are the expected trends, in line with the common
view of the order-disorder transition in the Vicsek model as arising from a competition between
mutual alignment and noise. To establish the existence of a phase transition and characterize it
(e.g., whether it is first- or second-order) requires more than these monotone trends in the OP.
One should demonstrate numerically the existence, in the thermodynamic limit, of a critical noise
ηc(ρ)and critical density ρc(η)such that for η > η corρ < ρ cthe OP vanishes. The order of
the transition can be inferred from the presence or absence of a jump in the OP, the extraction of
critical exponents [51], or Binder cumulants [56]. Indeed, there is still uncertainty concerning the8

order of the transition in the Vicsek model depending on the implementation details (e.g., intrinsic
vs. extrinsic noise) [3, 51, 56, 57].
The excess entropy contributions give a richer account of the transition. They provide an alter-
native point of view concerning the interplay between positional and orientational DOFs. Consider
the dependence of entropy on density at fixed noise amplitude, Fig. 2. Alignment reduces the en-
tropy of the orientational DOF. At low densities, the alignment requires clustering, which reduces
also the positional entropy. Thus stronger alignment and tighter clusters at low density make the
entropy decrease with density. At high density, on the other hand, alignment no longer requires
clustering, as every particle has many neighbors even in an ideal-gas distribution. The system can
“afford” a broad distribution of particle positions without affecting much the alignment, and the9

Symbols and parameters are the same as in Fig. 2.
entropy increases with density. (Recall that Figs. 2 and 3 show the excess entropy over that of the
ideal gas, which removes the trivial reduction in entropy due to the decreasing system size L.) Put
together, these two trends lead to a well-defined critical density where the slope of hex(ρ)changes
sign. As seen in Fig. 2, this point marks the transition much more sharply than the OP, especially
for small system sizes. The minimum in hex(ρ)is clearly observed even for N= 100 (not shown).
These transitions involve the formation of traveling bands [52, 58], appearing much more promi-
nently for N= 104(not shown). In our simulations, the bands moved strictly perpendicular to
the box boundaries, suggesting that they may have been boundary-related. Nevertheless, we find
that the entropy is lower still for the small-but-dense clusters than for the traveling-bands phases;
hence the steady rise of entropy with increasing ηin Fig. 3. The continuous entropy minimum as
a function of density, and its sharpening with increasing N(not shown), support a second-order
transition, at least within the range of parameters studied here.
All entropy contributions shown in Figs. 2 and 3 increase with noise amplitude, as expected.
Yet, the different contributions do not increase to the same extent. Since the noise acts directly on10
the orientational DOF, the distribution of this DOF is affected by changes in noise amplitude more
strongly than that of the translational DOF. Consequently, at a certain noise amplitude, the entropy
contributions from the positional and orientational DOFs switch order. Compare the panels for η=
0.4andη= 0.6in Fig. 2. This crossover from an orientation-dominated regime to a translation-
dominated regime does not appear to coincide with the order-disorder transition itself (see Fig. 3),
implying the existence of another transition. This may be related to the previously reported two
transitions, one being the well-known flocking transition (here consistent with a second-order
transition [51]), and the other indicating the gradual loss of orientational order while keeping some
positional order (i.e., transition from homogeneous patches to bands). See, e.g., the two curves
in Fig. 2(e) of Ref. [58], and the two critical noises ηb,cin Fig. 7 of Ref. [40]. The latter work
inferred the transition from entropy through a time-interlaced estimation algorithm, i.e., including
temporal information. For the range of parameters and system sizes studied here, the crossover
occurs in the range η= 0.4–0.5, independent of density.
Figures 2 and 3 show also the entropy contribution derived from the mixed CF, M(q). This
contribution is always more negative than the sum of the ones obtained from S(q)andD1(q)
separately, as mentioned in Sec. II. In the Vicsek model we find that the excess entropy from
hex[M]is only about 1percent lower than hex[S]+hex[D1]. Thus, in this model, cross-correlations
between particle positions and orientations do not contribute appreciably to the entropy.
IV . SWARMING BACTERIA
Bacterial swarming is a rapid mass-migration in which thousands of cells move collectively,
forming coherent patterns. Physically, swarming is a natural example of active particles consuming
energy to generate collective motion. Accordingly, understanding the constraints that physics
imposes on these dynamics is essential for clarifying the mechanisms underlying swarming [5, 59].
Here, we revisit experiments on swarming Bacillus subtilis cells with different aspect ratios and
at different area fractions — two physical parameters known to affect collective behavior [4]. See
Fig. 4.
Previous analysis of these experiments revealed three qualitatively distinct swarming regimes,
describing how cell shape and population density govern the dynamical characteristics of the
swarm. Strains with small aspect ratios, such as the wild-type (WT), exhibited rapid mixing,
homogeneous density, and no preferred direction of motion, for all tested values of area fraction.11

FIG. 4. Experimental snapshots showing swarming Bacillus subtilis bacteria with different aspect ratios
and at different area fractions. Reproduced from Ref. [4]. The scale bar is 50 µm.
The absence of qualitative differences over the range of area fractions suggests a single phase.
Long mutants showed different swarming statistics. In particular, two phases were identified — a
dilute phase consisting of small moving clusters, and a denser phase, in which large moving clus-
ters of the size of the viewing area caused strong number fluctuations in time [4]. Importantly,
the differences between the phases were identified using the cluster size distribution — an ad hoc
measurement which is not well defined (the definition of a bacterial cluster is not unique) — and
the temporal dynamics. Spatial correlation functions were not indicative of a phase transition.
In Ref. [4], a custom algorithm enabled tracking of individual cell trajectories and orientations.
We use the same data to obtain the CFs: the structure factor S(q), orientations CF D2(q)(correla-
tions between the nematic DOFs of the rod-like bacteria1), and their mixed CF M(q). The entropy
contributions of the corresponding DOFs are then inferred according to Sec. II. We concentrate on
the WT and the longest mutant, with aspect ratios of 7 and 19, respectively.
Figure 5 shows the excess entropy per particle, hex, as inferred from the three CFs mentioned
1Rod-like Bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis swarm cells are usually described as polar particles, rather than nematic
ones [5, 16, 59]. However, analyzing single images, one cannot distinguish the bacterial ‘head’ from its ‘tail’. For
this reason, we treat cells as nematic particles.12

FIG. 5. Excess entropy per particle hexas a function of area fraction ρfor the wild-type (left) and mutant
(right) bacteria. Different symbols show hexas obtained from the different correlation functions: structure
factor S(q)(orange circles), nematic orientations correlation function D2(q)(blue squares), and mixed
correlation function M(q)(red triangles). Also shown is the net entropy of position-orientation cross-
correlations (gray diamonds). Full symbols correspond to points obtained from 250–300 samples, and
empty symbols to less reliable points obtained from less than 250 samples. The dashed vertical line in
the right panel marks a first-order transition. The gray area and dashed vertical line in the left panel may
indicate hitherto unrecognized transitions.
above, as a function of the area fraction, for the WT (left panel) and long mutant (right panel). We
plot also the entropy contribution of cross-correlations, hcross=hex[M]−(hex[S] +hex[D2]).
For the elongated mutant (Fig. 5, right), a sharp jump in all entropy contributions around ρ=
0.18indicates a first-order transition. (The relative jump is similar for all four entropies; it is
less evident in Fig. 5 for the smaller contributions from S(q)andD2(q).) This agrees with the
observations in Ref. [4]. The transition from a lower excess entropy in the dilute phase to a
higher one in the dense phase is counter-intuitive. One expects a higher area fraction to lead to
stronger alignment and thus to lower entropy. As we have seen in the Vicsek model, however,
this is not always the case. At low area fractions isolated cells are immobile, possibly because
single cells cannot form a hydrated layer necessary to move [5]. As a result, the alignment of cells
that are close to one another (and therefore moving together) is significantly higher, resulting in
strong position-orientation cross-correlations. Indeed, these cross-correlations give the dominant
contribution to the entropy (gray diamonds in Fig. 5, right panel). The first-order transition implies
coexistence of the two states — stationary isolated cells and small moving clusters. The motion13
of the clusters makes the two ‘phases’ mix spatially.
For the WT (Fig. 5, left), the entropy reveals subtle phenomena and possibly new transitions,
which the standard CF analysis did not identify [4]. First, there is a gap between ρ= 0.27and
ρ= 0.33, reflecting a very small number of samples in this range, which did not allow entropy
calculation.2The entropy contributions of alignment and cross-correlations show a jump across
the gap, possibly indicating a first-order transition. These observations may again be rationalized
by the coexistence of two phases. Unlike the elongated mutant, WT cells can move at low area
fraction, and their spatial distribution is locally homogeneous at all area fractions. Hence, the
swarm segregates into locally homogeneous, mobile domains of low and high area fraction. Sam-
ples whose mean area fraction falls in the coexistence range would be found only when the field of
view covers an intermediate region separating the two phases, which explains the scarcity of such
samples.
Thus the first-order transition is seen for both the WT and mutant strains; yet, because WT cells
can move at low area fraction while the mutants cannot, the transition is manifested differently.
The mutant undergoes the transition at a lower area fraction. This may hint at an active isotropic-
to-nematic transition, which is promoted by the mutant’s large aspect ratio.
The second interesting observation concerning the WT cells is the sharp minimum at ρ= 0.41,
which may indicate a second-order transition. The non-monotone dependence on area fraction
is manifested in all entropy contributions. It is reminiscent of the entropy variation across the
flocking transition in the Vicsek model (cf. Fig. 2), involving a competition between positional
and orientational entropies.
V . DISCUSSION
This work has two goals. The physical goal has been to identify and characterize hitherto un-
recognized features of two canonical active systems — the Vicsek model and bacterial swarming.
A more general, technical goal has been to demonstrate the applicability and advantages of the
entropy-bounds method.
In the Vicsek model we have found further evidence for an order-disorder transition of con-
tinuous (second-order) nature. We have clarified the interplay between positions and orienta-
tions before and after the transition while pin-pointing its critical density for varying noise ampli-
2The data are sufficient for inferring a correlation length [4].14
tude. Our method has also allowed the identification of a crossover from orientation-dominated
to position-dominated collective dynamics above a certain noise amplitude (consistent with pre-
vious studies [40, 58]), which is insensitive to density. In bacterial suspensions we have found
clear-cut evidence for a discontinuous, first-order transition, associated with separation into coex-
isting domains of different density and mobility. At higher area fraction we have identified another
transition, continuous (probably second-order) in nature, with entropy dependence resembling the
Vicsek flocking transition.
Concerning the second goal, we have established the ability of the entropy-bounds method
to distill the information contained in structural correlations into a single useful number while
resolving the different contributions coming from different microscopic DOFs. This ability has
led to the new observations mentioned above. The method has another crucial advantage which
has not been used here. We have measured the CFs from ‘microscopic’ configurations obtained
by simulation or microscopy. These configurations could be fed into alternative, computational
entropy-estimation methods. However, CFs are coarse-grained properties which can be obtained
by macroscopic measurements without direct access to the particles’ DOFs. For example, the CFs
could be obtained by scattering and birefringence. Thus we hope that the entropy-bounds method
will become a wide-spread useful tool for identifying and characterizing transitions of diverse
systems in and out of equilibrium.
