Energy dissipation is of fundamental interest and crucial importance in quantum systems. How-
ever, whether energy dissipation can emerge without backscattering inside topological systems re-
mains a question. As a hallmark, we propose a microscopic picture that illustrates energy dissipation
in the quantum Hall (QH) plateau regime of graphene. Despite the quantization of Hall, longitudi-
nal, and two-probe resistances (dubbed as the quantum limit), we find that the energy dissipation
emerges in the form of Joule heat. It is demonstrated that the non-equilibrium energy distribution
of carriers plays much more essential roles than the resistance on energy dissipation. Eventually,
we suggest probing the phenomenon by measuring local temperature increases in experiments and
reconsidering the dissipation typically ignored in realistic topological circuits.
Introduction. — Topology is a basic concept to classify
quantum matter of which the electronic band structure
is associated with a topological invariant [1–5]. One dra-
matic consequence of such unique electronic systems is
the presence of edge or surface states within the band gap
and such gapless excitations can support quantized trans-
port response [2]. Moreover, the corresponding quan-
tized transport could be robust in the sense that the edge
states are topologically protected against local perturba-
tions [3]. As a symbol, two-dimensional topological in-
sulators with time-reversal symmetry breaking, such as
integer quantum Hall (QH) [6–8] and quantum anoma-
lous Hall (QAH) insulators [9–15], are characterized by
Chern number and essentially possess one-dimensional
chiral edge states accompanied by exact quantized Hall
resistance and zero longitudinal resistance. The chiral
edge states contributing to the exactly quantized charge
transport are regarded as dissipationless within the con-
ductor, along which electric currents flow unidirection-
ally and backscattering is forbidden by topological pro-
tection [15, 16]. As such, the topological insulators are
promising candidates in the next-generation dissipation-
less electronic devices [17–19]. However, the connection
between dissipation and topological protection has not
been adequately elucidated in complex topological sys-
tem [20–24]. Local dissipation within topological devices
can result in undesirably high temperatures that can neg-
atively impact device safety, reliability, and performance.
Thus, we pose the question of whether the topological
edge states are immune from heat dissipation in topolog-
ical quantized charge transport.
A preliminary answer provided by conventional meso-
scopic transport theory seems affirmative [see Fig. 1]. For
a topologically trivial ballistic conductor with one elastic
barrier in Fig. 1(a), the total resistance ( R= 1/(1−r))
in the units of h/e2is the sum of the barrier resistance
FIG. 1. (a) Single-channel conductor with an elastic bar-
rier and (b) energy distribution of right-moving (+ k) elec-
trons F+k(E) with reflection probability r. The symbols in
(a) represent electron distribution at various positions, cor-
responding to the lines in (b). In (a), heat is generated in
both the contacts and the conductor. The elastic barrier in-
duces a highly non-equilibrium + kstate, and heat arises from
energy relaxation processes that return this state to a Fermi-
distributed state. (c) QH/QAH system with an elastic bar-
rier, and (d) energy distribution of + kelectrons. The chiral
edge channel bypasses the barrier and maintains a Fermi dis-
tribution. Consequently, heat generation occurs solely within
the contacts. In the main text, we find that the conven-
tional interpretation in (a-d) is insufficient to explain the
relationship between dissipation and topological protection.

(R0=r/(1−r)) and the intrinsic contact resistance
(Rc= 1), where spin degeneracy is neglected [25–28].arXiv:2303.07692v2  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  11 Jan 2024ii
Considering inelastic processes, nonequilibrium electrons
relax [see Fig. 1(b)] and energy dissipates in both the
contacts and the conductor, which satisfies the Joule’s
law (Q=I2R) [29]. However, for a QH case with ν= 1
[see Fig. 1(c)], the right-moving (+ k) state will bypass
the barrier, leading to a barrier resistance of R0= 0 [16].
Here still exists a minimum contact resistance of h/e2
which is general and inevitable [27]. Meanwhile, the
topological system enters the quantum limit. It seems
that in the quantum limit, energy dissipation only gener-
ates within the contacts rather than inside the conductor.
However, a recent experiment investigating the QH ef-
fect reported unexpected heat dissipation at graphene
boundaries which challenges the above statement [20].
Although several theoretical studies proposed some mi-
croscopic explanations [22–24], they at most demonstrate
dissipation can occur under certain backscattering, while
the backscattering can keep the Hall conductance quan-
tized but cause additional two-probe resistance. One
advantage of chiral edge states is topological protection
against backscattering, which in principle leads to a mini-
mum and quantized contact resistance. Such a minimum
resistance is always inevitable [27]. Thus, whether en-
ergy dissipation can occur in such a situation is not only
unresolved, but also more fundamental and important.
In this work, we propose a microscopic picture in topo-
logical systems that illustrates energy dissipation without
undermining the quantum limit [see Fig. 1(e)]. Specifi-
cally, we investigate the transport properties of graphene
in the QH plateau regime in which the Hall, the lon-
gitudinal, and the contact/two-probe resistances are all
quantized [see Fig. 2(c) and 2(d)]. However, in such a
typical scenario, the energy dissipation unexpectedly ap-
pears along the propagation of QH edge states, as shown
by spatially resolved energy dissipation in Fig. 2(b). Fur-
thermore, we elucidate where and how the energy dissi-
pation takes place by analyzing the energy distribution
of electrons along the QH edge channels [see the bub-
bles in Fig. 1(e)]. To be specific, in the presence of a
scattering barrier, electrons are scattered between the
channels induced by edge reconstruction. Such scatter-
ing does not induce any extra two-probe resistance but
transforms electrons into non-equilibrium which is nec-
essary for energy dissipation. Through energy relaxation
processes, the non-equilibrium electrons dissipate their
energy in the form of heat. Ultimately, we discuss the
experimental realization and the energy dissipation in ex-
isting topological circuits.
Emergent dissipation in effective model — We con-
sider a six-terminal Hall measurement device based on
graphene [see Fig. 2(a)], of which the spinless tight-
binding Hamiltonian reads [15, 22, 30–33],

is the hopping parameter. An external magnetic field Bz
is included, which is manifested by the Peierls phase ϕmn
on the hopping parameter t[34, 35]. For convenience,
the magnetic field is expressed in terms of a dimension-
less quantity Φ B=Bza2
0/Φ0, with Φ 0=h/|e|being the
magnetic flux quantum and a0being the lattice constant
of graphene [36].
To simulate the elastic scattering process in real de-
vices, we introduce a long-range scattering barrier Vn
near the bottom edge of graphene [37]. Besides, the edge
reconstruction is ubiquitous along the graphene edges in-
duced by charge accumulation [20, 38–42]. To incorpo-
rate its effect, an electrostatic potential Eedge
nis added
in the vicinity of the graphene boundary [see the orange
region in Fig. 2(a)]. This approach has demonstrated
successful implementation in numerical simulations of
giant nonlocality in graphene [21]. Energy relaxation
processes, such as electron-phonon interaction [43, 44]
and electron-electron interaction [45–47], are also widely
present. Under B¨ uttiker-probe scheme, the complex en-
ergy relaxation processes are effectively reduced to a
single-particle picture with couplings between electrons
and environmental reservoirs [48, 49]. Thus, these pro-iii
cesses are involved by attaching B¨ uttiker probes to lattice
sites, which manifests itself as an appropriate self-energy

Transport of charge and energy is analyzed via non-
equilibrium Green’s function method and multi-terminal
Landauer-B¨ uttiker formalism, which is expressed under

real contacts and B¨ uttiker probes [55]. Tpqrepresents the
total transmission from terminal qto terminal p.Vp(q)
andTp(q)refer to the voltage and temperature of terminal
p(q), respectively.
Thus, based on the six-terminal device and Eq. (2), we
numerically calculate the Hall resistance Rxyand the lon-
gitudinal resistance Rxx, which shows the system exhibits
a perfect QH effect [see Fig. 2(c)]. Without loss of gen-
erality, we assume the dissipated energy is totally trans-
ferred to the environmental reservoir via B¨ uttiker probes
rather than raises the local temperature, i.e., Tp=T0for
all terminals with the background temperature T0= 0.
Under such boundary conditions, the dissipated energy
appears around the boundary of graphene [see Fig. 2(b)].
To reveal how energy dissipation affects the two-probe re-
sistance R2p, we choose perfect contacts which electrons
can enter without suffering reflections [44, 56]. Here, R2p
still reaches a minimum value h/e2in the presence of heat
dissipation [see Fig. 2(d)], which indicates the dissipa-
tion inside the conductor is compatible with the quantum
limit.
Mechanism of energy dissipation under quantum
limit— Initially, we figure out the trajectory of electrons
that carry charge and energy in Fig. 2(b). The local elec-
tric current J(X, Y ) [29, 57–59] in Fig. 3(a) captures the
flow of electrons in Fig. 2(b) [see S6 of the Supplemental
Material for more details]. Due to the presence of edge
potential Eedge
n, there exists a pair of QH edge channels
as inferred by experiments [20]. When a bias is applied
(µL> µ R), electrons exit from the left contact, enter the
central conductor, and populate the outer edge channel.
The scattering barrier Vnaround the bottom edge in-
duces the mixing between the inner and outer edge chan-
nels. After the barrier, the electric current splits into twoparts: one moves rightwards along the outer edge channel
and the other propagates along the inner channel, both
of which end up in the right contact. Despite the pres-
ence of scattering, the total transmission probability of
electrons from left to right is still 1, which leads to the
quantum limit of the two-probe resistance R2p=h/e2in
Fig. 2(d).
By tracing the path of the electric current, we consider
the spatially resolved energy distribution of electrons,
F(n, E), to quantitatively address the issue of where and
how heat dissipation occurs. Generally, F(n, E) is de-
fined as [22, 29]
F(n, E) = Tr[ Ge
n,n]/Tr[An,n] (3)
where A= i[Gr−Ga] is the spectral function and Ge
n,n=
−iG<
n,ndescribes the electron density (times 2 π) per unit
energy [44]. To concisely show the underlying physics,
B¨ uttiker probes are only placed in the rectangle region
[see Fig. 3(b)] [60].
First, we trace the outer channel at the bottom edge,
as marked by colored squares in Fig. 3(b), and plot the
distribution in Fig. 3(c). To the left of the barrier, the
right-moving channel is fully populated by electrons from
the left contact since the contact is “perfect” [44, 56].
These electrons stay in equilibrium with the left contact,
i.e., a zero-temperature Fermi distribution with chemical
potential µL[61]. This semiclassical analysis is consis-
tent with the numerical result in Fig. 3(c) at x≲60a0
which is exactly a step function F(E) =θ(µL−E). Un-

der the action of the barrier, electrons from the outer
channel with a chemical potential µLare scattered with a
probability into the inner channel where electrons are ini-
tially in equilibrium with a chemical potential µR(< µ L),
Thus, the scattered right-moving state is partially occu-
pied within the energy interval ( µR,µL), which means the
distribution function is no longer a step function. Such
a non-equilibrium distribution is numerically confirmed
in Fig. 3(c) at x≳100a0. The above elastic scattering
induced by the barrier generates non-equilibrium elec-
trons which are necessary to heat generation [62]. We
also investigate a case without the elastic barrier Vnin
the Supplemental Material [29], in which the absence of
heat dissipation confirms that the energy dissipation is
indeed sourced from the edge states.
Next, we consider the inner channel marked by col-
ored dots in Fig. 3(b) which passes through the rectangle
region attached with B¨ uttiker probes. Similarly, elec-
trons in the inner channel after the barrier are also out
of equilibrium. In the rectangle region, non-equilibrium
electrons exchange their energy instead of particles with
environmental reservoirs. Through this irreversible pro-
cess, equilibrium reestablishes and the corresponding dis-
tribution of electrons is expected to gradually restore to
a Fermi function with a new chemical potential. Mean-
while, the energy dissipates into the environmental reser-
voirs in the form of heat. Such a relaxation process is ver-
ified by distribution functions in Fig. 3(d) at x≳20a0
where F(E) gradually evolves back to a step function
atx≈200a0. The dissipated energy is also presented
in Fig. 3(b). In brief, we demonstrate that energy dissi-
pation is compatible with the quantum limit.
Experimental routines and discussions — On the exper-
iment side, the energy dissipation inevitably leads to an
increase in local temperature, due to the finite thermal
conductivity between the device and the environment.
Thus, measuring the variation of local temperature ∆ T
is a feasible scheme to verify our picture. Recently, a
scanning nano-thermometer has been reported to probelocal temperature variations with high sensitivity at low
temperature, which utilizes a superconducting quantum
interference device on a tip, or namely, SOT [63, 64]. As
for experimental routines, we consider a concrete model
in Fig. 4(a) which depicts a thermometer SOT placed
above the six-terminal graphene device.
To simulate the variation of local temperature, we ran-
domly assign some of the B¨ uttiker probes with poor ther-
mal conductivity, i.e., Qp= 0 and Tp̸=T0for certain
p. Utilizing the boundary conditions and Eq. (2), the lo-
cal temperature variation ∆ Tis illustrated in Fig. 4(b),
while the device maintains quantized resistance of h/e2
in the quantum limit. Notably, the region where tem-
perature increases in Fig. 4(b) basically corresponds to
the region where energy dissipates, as shown in Fig. 2(b).
The commonly accepted view that heat generation in the
quantum limit occurs only at the contacts and not within
the conductor is challenged by the rise in local tempera-
ture inside the conductor.
Quantitatively, the enhancement of local temperature
∆Tin Fig. 4(b) is up to three orders of magnitude
less than the background temperature T0= 4.2 K [65].
Remarkably, ∆ Tcan be captured by the micro-kelvin
sensitivity of the nano-thermometer SOT [20, 64]. Be-
sides, the width of edge reconstruction in graphene ex-
periments is about several hundreds of nanometers, for
instance, about 260 nm in the QH transport [20] and
200 nm-width edge charge accumulation region in the
nonlocal transport [21]. Experimentally, it is feasible to
reversibly write high-resolution doping patterns and ar-
tificially tune the edge potential [66]. Under an external
magnetic field, B∼1 Tesla, the width scale of QH edge
states is in the magnitude order of the magnetic length
lB=/radicalbig
ℏ/|e|B∼60 nm. Thus, it is feasible to fabricate a
device as in Fig. 4(a) and probe the emergent energy dis-
sipation by quantifying the local temperature increments
as anticipated by our theoretical framework.
On the practical side, our analysis provides further in-
sight into topological circuit designs. Recently, several
groups have reported the realization of a QAH junction
with different Chern numbers [67, 68]. Such Chern in-
sulator junctions can function as a chiral edge-current
divider, and even facilitate the development of topolog-
ical circuits [17–19]. As an example, we perform a cal-
culation on one of the devices in the Supplemental Ma-
terial [29]. While the quantization of charge transport
may not be compromised by the scattering among multi-
ple chiral channels, as reported in recent studies [67, 68],
energy dissipation can still appear according to our pic-
ture [29]. In other words, for many topological devices
in the quantum limit [18, 19, 69–72], energy dissipation
can still emerge inside the conductors, which is beyond
Ref. [22]. Local dissipation inside topological devices may
cause excessive temperature which is harmful to their
safety, reliability, and performance. As such, it still re-
quires careful attention to energy dissipation in topolog-v
ical quantum systems and topological quantum compu-
tation.
Conclusion. — To summarize, we find that the energy
of electrons can dissipate without backscattering, while
chiral edge states reduce the resistance to a minimum and
quantized value. In the QH plateau regime of graphene,
energy dissipation emerges in the form of heat. Remark-
ably, the generation of energy dissipation takes place in
the quantum limit, i.e., R2p=h/e2,Rxy=−h/e2and
Rxx= 0. The analysis of electron energy distribution re-
veals that electrons can evolve between equilibrium and
non-equilibrium states which causes energy dissipation
along the QH edge states without introducing any extra
two-probe resistance R2p. Such dissipation can be probed
by measuring local temperature increase. Furthermore,
our work demonstrates that energy dissipation without
backscattering is especially for the application of topo-
logical materials in low-dissipation electronic devices.

S1. SEMICLASSICAL ANALYSIS OF JOULE’S HEAT
FIG. S1. (a) Single-channel ballistic conductor with one elastic barrier. Energy distribution of the right-moving (+ k) electrons
F+k(E) (b) and the left-moving electrons F−k(E) (c) with reflection probability r. In (a), the generation of heat occurs in both
the contacts and the conductor. The elastic barrier makes the + kand−kstates highly non-equilibrium and the heat occurs
through energy relaxation processes which evolve the highly non-equilibrium state back into a Fermi-distributed state.
To reveal how energy dissipates in the form of Joule heat, we choose perfect contacts which electrons can enter
without suffering reflections [1–4]. In the following analysis, we will neglect interference effects and treat the electrons
as semiclassical particles. In Fig. S1, the + kstates to the left of the barrier are occupied only by electrons coming in
from the left contact. At zero temperature, the distribution function reads [black line in Fig. S1(b)]
F(1)
+k(E) =fleft(E) =θ(µhigh−E) (+ kbefore scattering) (1)
Similarly, the chemical potential of particles occupying −kstates to the right of the barrier is equivalent to that of
the right contact. Hence, the distribution function of −kis given by [black line in Fig. S1(c)]
F(1)
−k(E) =fright(E) =θ(µlow−E) ( −kbefore scattering) (2)
For + kstates after scattering but before energy relaxation, the states between µlowandµhighare partially filled with
probability (1 −r) (the transmission probability 1 −r), so that [yellow line in Fig. S1(b)]
F(2)
+k(E) =θ(µlow−E) + (1 −r) [θ(µhigh−E)−θ(µlow−E)] (+ kafter scattering but before energy relaxation)
(3)
Similarly, for −kstates after scattering but before energy relaxation, the states between µlowandµhighare partially
filled with probability ( r), so that [yellow line in Fig. S1(c)]
F(2)
−k(E) =θ(µlow−E) +r[θ(µhigh−E)−θ(µlow−E)] ( −kafter scattering but before energy relaxation) (4)
F(2)
+k(E) and F(2)
−k(E) are highly non-equilibrium distributions. After energy relaxation, they become [red line
in Fig. S1(b)]
F(3)
+k(E) =θ(µ−E) (+ kafter energy relaxation) (5)
and [red line in Fig. S1(c)]
F(3)
−k(E) =θ(µ′−E) ( −kafter energy relaxation) (6)
Due to the conservation of particles, i.e., the total number of electrons is invariant, the new µandµ′reads
µ=µlow+ (1−r)(µhigh−µlow) (7)
µ′=µlow+r(µhigh−µlow) (8)S3
The electric current flows from the left contact to the right contact is determined by

h(1−r)∆V(9)
Here, −e∆V=µhigh−µlowande <0. Thus, the total resistance R= 1/(1−r) in the unit of h/e2which can be
written as a series combination of contact resistance ( Rc= 1) and the barrier resistance ( R0=r/(1−r)).
Next, we analyze the energy dissipation which consists of four different parts, including relaxation of + kstates in
the interior of the conductor ( Q+k), relaxation of −kstates in the interior of the conductor ( Q−k), relaxation at the
interfaces near the left ( QL) and right ( QR) contacts.
1.Relaxation at the interfaces near the left contact, QL
According to the semiclassical analysis of the distribution functions, + kelectrons with F(1)
+k(E) flows out of
the left contact and −kelectrons with F(3)
−k(E) flow into the left contact. For instance, electrons with positive
momentum + kflowing in the conductor with energy Eare injected from the left contact with energy µhigh.
Here, the left contact serves as an electron reservoir with chemical potential µhigh. In this process, the loss of
energy µhigh−Eis dissipated. Thus, from Eq. (1) and Eq. (6) the power of energy dissipation is

2.Relaxation at the interfaces near the right contact, QR
Similarly, −kelectrons with F(1)
−k(E) flows out of the right contact and + kelectrons with F(3)
+k(E) flow into the
right contact. Thus, from Eq. (5) and Eq. (2), the power of energy dissipation is

3.Relaxation of +kstates in the interior of the conductor, Q+k
It refers to the evolution of the non-equilibrium distribution F(2)

From Eq. (3) and Eq. (5) the power of energy dissipation is

4.Relaxation of −kstates in the interior of the conductor, Q−k
It refers to the evolution of the non-equilibrium distribution F(2)
−k(E) to the Fermi distribution F(3)
−k(E).
From Eq. (4) and Eq. (6) the power of energy dissipation is

In other words, the total power of energy dissipation satisfies Joule’s law. Moreover, the power of energy dissipation

(1−r)e2is the barrier resistance(15)
According to Eq. (15), as long as r̸= 0 (i.e., backscattering exists), Q0>0, and energy dissipation will occur
within the conductor. From the conventional viewpoint, topological systems with chiral edge states can eliminate
local resistance (i.e., r= 0 and R0= 0) and leave only quantized contact or terminal resistance. In this way, it is
claimed that dissipation-free transport can be realized. However, the validity of this assertion remains an unanswered
question which also constitutes the primary focus of our research.S5
S2. A CASE IN THE ABSENCE OF THE ELASTIC BARRIER Vn
FIG. S2. (a). Schematic plot of a six-terminal Hall device in graphene. In contrast to Fig. 2 in the main text, the absence of the
elastic barrier Vnis taken into account. An edge electrostatic potential Eedge
nis applied in the orange region, which simulates
the edge reconstruction in realistic materials. The chemical potential of contact L(R) is represented by µL(µR). (b) The local
electric current J(X, Y) and (c) the local energy current Qφ(X, Y) in the quantum Hall plateau regime with Rxy=−h/e2.
Here, EF= 0.05 eV and Φ B= 0.004. The B¨ uttiker probes are randomly distributed all over the graphene sample and the
numerical simulation is averaged over 1280 B¨ uttiker-probe configurations. The energy distribution of electrons Fas a function
of normalized energy ( E−µR)/|e|V2p(0 for the right contact and 1 for the left contact) in (d) refers to the sites marked by
colored squares in (b).
In the main text, we introduce an elastic barrier denoted as Vn, which is positioned at the lower edge of graphene.
The scattering barrier takes the form of a Gaussian-shaped long-range potential, with its mathematical expression as
follows:
Vn=V0e−|Rn−R0|/Λ(16)
where Rn= (xn, yn) labels the coordinate of lattice site n,R0denotes the potential center and V0describes the
scattering strength. In calculations, R0≈(105a0,29.7a0),V0=−0.35eV and Λ = 10 a0. Here, in Fig. S2, the absence
of the elastic barrier Vnis taken into account. Then, the electric current directly flows from the left contact into the
right contact [see the local current density J(X, Y) in Fig. S2(b)]. Following the semiclassical analysis in the main
text, electrons occupying the outer channel stay in equilibrium with the left contact, i.e., a zero-temperature Fermi
distribution with chemical potential µL. As in Fig. S2(d), the energy distribution of electrons F(n, E) is exactly a step
function F(E) =θ(µL−E). Even though the energy relaxation processes are included, the electrons in equilibrium do
not dissipate their energy into environmental reservoirs, which is consistent with the numerical result of local energy
current Qφ(X, Y) in Fig. S2(c).
In this context, energy dissipation does not occur because non-equilibrium electrons are absent. We show that the
elastic barrier in the main text causes mixing between the inner and outer edge channels, which enables the production
of non-equilibrium electrons that are crucial for heat generation. In real devices, elastic scattering processes simulated
by the barrier Vnare ubiquitous.S6
S3. A CASE WITH THE ELASTIC BARRIER VnIN THE BULK
FIG. S3. (a). Schematic plot of a six-terminal Hall device in graphene. In contrast to Fig. 2 in the main text, the elastic
barrier Vnis placed within the bulk. An edge electrostatic potential Eedge
nis applied in the orange region, which simulates
the edge reconstruction in realistic materials. The chemical potential of contact L(R) is represented by µL(µR). (b) The local
electric current J(X, Y) and (c) the local energy current Qφ(X, Y) in the quantum Hall plateau regime with Rxy=−h/e2.
Here, EF= 0.05 eV and Φ B= 0.004. The B¨ uttiker probes are randomly distributed all over the graphene sample and the
numerical simulation is averaged over 1280 B¨ uttiker-probe configurations. The energy distribution of electrons Fas a function
of normalized energy ( E−µR)/|e|V2p(0 for the right contact and 1 for the left contact) in (d) refers to the sites marked by
colored squares in (b).
Compared with the previous section and the main text, we introduce an elastic barrier denoted as Vn, which is
positioned in the bulk of graphene. In calculations, the potential center R0≈(105a0,110a0) and a0is the lattice
constant of graphene. The electric current directly flows from the left contact into the right contact [see the local
current density J(X, Y) in Fig. S3(b)]. Following the semiclassical analysis in the main text, electrons occupying
the outer channel stay in equilibrium with the left contact, i.e., a zero-temperature Fermi distribution with chemical
potential µL. As in Fig. S3(d), the energy distribution of electrons F(n, E) is exactly a step function F(E) =θ(µL−E).
Even though the energy relaxation processes are included, the electrons in equilibrium do not dissipate their energy into
environmental reservoirs, which is consistent with the numerical result of local energy current Qφ(X, Y) in Fig. S3(c).
The absence of heat dissipation confirms that the energy dissipation is indeed sourced from the edge states.S7
S4. DISSIPATION ANALYSIS OF A CHERN JUNCTION
FIG. S4. (a) Schematic plot of the chiral current divider reproduced from the Fig. 3b of the reference (Nat. Commun. 14, 770
(2023) [5]). (b) The calculated result of local energy dissipation which is averaged over 216 B¨ uttiker-probe configurations.
Regarding two recent experiments [Nat. Commun. 13, 5967 (2022); Nat. Commun. 14, 770 (2023)], they have
reported the realization of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) junctions with different Chern numbers and observed
quantized charge transport. Upon these findings, they claim that junctions composed of Chern insulators can operate
as dissipation-free current dividers, and hold potential dissipationless topological devices.
In the last paragraph of the section “ Experimental routines and discussions ” in the main text, we predict that
energy dissipation without backscattering can still emerge inside the conductors in these experimental devices [e.g.,
Nat. Commun. 13, 5967 (2022); Nat. Commun. 14, 770 (2023)]. To make such a statement more solid, we apply our
theory to one of the devices [see Fig. S4(a)] which is a junction consisting of Chern insulators. In this device, terminal
2 and 3 are grounded and a chemical potential difference is applied between terminal 1 and them. The two-resistance
(from terminal 1 to ground) is also quantized ( R2p=h/e2), i.e., there is no backscattering and chiral edge transport
eliminates local resistivity leaving only quantized contact resistance. However, significant energy dissipation emerges
at the domain wall of the junction as well as its downstream region [see Fig. S4(b)].
An intuitive and semiclassical explanation is consistent with the physical picture in our manuscript [see the schematic
of the transport process and qualitative energy distributions of electrons in Fig. S4(a)]. The red channel to the left of
the domain wall is occupied only by electrons coming in from the left contact. Hence these states are in equilibrium
and have the same electrochemical potential as the left contact [see the schematic of fully occupied energy levels at
the bottom-left of Fig. S4(a)]. At the domain wall, electrons are scattered between two chiral edge channels. Hence, in
the energy range between µlowandµhigh, the states are filled partially [see the schematic of partially occupied levels
at the bottom-middle of Fig. S4(a)]. Such a distribution is a highly nonequilibrium one. Through inelastic processes
such as phonon emission, the electrons will settle down to lower energies and a Fermi distribution will be established
[see the schematic of occupation in new equilibrium at the top-middle of Fig. S4(a)]. This evolution process leads toS8
the dissipation of energy. Thus, the energy dissipation in the quantum limit is universal in topological devices and is
especially important for the application of topological materials in dissipationless electronic devices.S9
S5. RECURSIVE GREEN’S FUNCTION METHOD
The primary physical quantities can be represented in terms of Green’s functions. Generally speaking, to obtain
Green’s functions, it is necessary to compute the inverse of large matrices, which is usually infeasible in practice.
However, the recursive Green’s function method is an efficient algorithm for calculating Green’s functions [6, 7].
For a tight-binding model, the effective Hamiltonian, /hatwideHeff, that includes real leads and B¨ uttiker probes, reads
/hatwideHeff=/hatwideH+/hatwideΣϕ,
where /hatwideHrefers to the Hamiltonian consisting of the contacts, the central region and the hopping matrix between
contacts and the central region. /hatwideΣϕ, as in the main text, represents the self-energies accounting for the inclusion of
B¨ uttiker probes.
By partitioning the device into Nslices and doing mathematical derivation, one can obtain the following specific
form [7]. For the diagonal blocks, we have

bond located at ( X, Y). In a graphene device, each carbon-carbon bond connects a pair of carbon atoms iandj. So,
J(X, Y) is actually the quantity Ji→jcalculated by (22).S13
S7. ENERGY CURRENT TRANSPORT
A. Energy current
Firstly, we can define the energy flow. Intuitively, electric current can be defined as
J=e/summationdisplay
αnαvα
where αlabels the quantum states. Electric current represents the number of electrons passing through a unit area
in a unit of time. Each particle carries a charge e. Thus, the energy current density can be similarly defined as

where charge eis replaced with the energy ϵαcarried by the particle. The multi-terminal Landauer formula of energy

B. Local energy dissipation
Under the B¨ uttiker-probe scheme, local energy dissipation is defined as the difference between the energy current
flowing into terminal p,JEp, and the energy current in the environmental reservoir, µpJp,
Qp=µpJp−JEp

h/summationdisplay

The local energy dissipation Q(X, Y) in the Fig. 2(b) of the main text refers to the net energy current flowing into
the B¨ uttiker probe pwhich is located at ( X, Y). The Fig. 2(b) in the main text shows the averaged Q(X, Y) over
different B¨ uttiker-probe configurations.
S8. ENERGY DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRONS
With Green’s functions, the energy distribution of electrons can be defined intuitively as [10],
F(n, E) =Tr/bracketleftbig
Ge
n,n(E)/bracketrightbig
Tr [A n,n(E)]. (23)
The spectral function is An,n(E) =i/bracketleftbig

, which tells us the nature of the allowed electronic states,
regardless of whether they are occupied or not. Ge
n,n(E) =−iG<
n,n(E) is the electron correlation function which tells
how many of these states are occupied or empty. Thus, the ratio of them reflects the distribution probability. Here,S14

S9. LOCAL DENSITY OF STATES
A. Theoretical formula
In terms of Green’s function, the local density of states ρat a given position rand a given Fermi energy EFis
defined as follows:
ρ(r, E) =1
2πtr [A(r, E)] (25)
where the spectral function is A(E) =i[Gr(E)−Ga(E)]. The diagonal elements of the spectral function give the
local density of states.
B. Relevant analysis about our model
FIG. S5. (a) Schematic plot of the graphene device attached with semi-infinite left and right contacts. An edge electrostatic
potential Eedge
n = 0.1 eV, as in the main text, is applied in the orange region with EF= 0.05 eV and Φ B= 0.004. (b)
Local density of states (LDOS) of the central region without B¨ uttiker probes and the scattering barrier. (c) Chern numbers of
different regions in (a).
we consider the device as depicted in Figure 2(a) of the main text, without the inclusion of side electrodes, as shown
in Fig. S5(a). Within our physical framework, in contrast to perfect graphene, an electrostatic potential Eedge
nis added
in the vicinity of the graphene boundary [see the orange region in Fig. S5(a)]. To better illustrate the structure of
edge states, the long-range scattering potential barrier has been removed. Under a magnetic field, Landau levels will
form in the device. By recursive Green’s function method, the local density of states at a given position and a given
Fermi energy can be calculated by Eq. (25).
The calculation results are presented in Fig. S5(b), where the edge potential results in the existence of edge states
on both the inner and outer sides of the sample, i.e., the inner and outer channels. If there were no edge potential
barrier, the system would be in a phase with a Chern number of 1. However, due to the presence of the edge potential
barrier, the energy in the orange region is shifted, leading to a phase with a Chern number of -1. According to the
bulk-edge correspondence, the environment outside the device is equivalent to vacuum, resulting in one edge state
along the outer boundary of the device. Additionally, two edge states are found at the domain wall within the device’s
interior.
