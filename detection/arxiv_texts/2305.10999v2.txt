MEAN SQUARE TEMPORAL ERROR ESTIMATES FOR THE 2D STOCHASTIC
NAVIER–STOKES EQUATIONS WITH TRANSPORT NOISE
D. BREIT, T.C. MOYO, A. PROHL, AND J. WICHMANN
Abstract. We study the 2D Navier–Stokes equation with transport noise subject to peri-
odic boundary conditions. Our main result is an error estimate for the time-discretisation
showing a convergence rate of order (up to) 1/2. It holds with respect to mean square
error convergence, whereas previously such a rate for the stochastic Navier–Stokes equa-
tions was only known with respect to convergence in probability. Our result is based on
uniform-in-probability estimates for the continuous as well as the time-discrete solution
exploiting the particular structure of the noise.
Eventually, we perform numerical simulations for the corresponding problem on bounded
domains with no-slip boundary conditions. They suggest the same convergence rate as
proved for the periodic problem hinging sensitively on the compatibility of the data. We
also compare the energy profiles with those for corresponding problems with additive or
multiplicative Itˆ o-type noise.
1.Introduction
Model and motivation. In this paper we study the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equa-
tions with a suitable multiplicative noise of transport type on the torus T2⊂R2. Let
Q:= (0 , T)×T2with T > 0, the system describes the time evolution of a homogeneous
fluid where the unknowns are the velocity field u: (0, T)×T2→R2and the pressure
π: (0, T)×T2→R, and it reads


du=µ∆udt−(u· ∇)udt− ∇πdt+PK
k=1(σk· ∇)u◦dWkinQ,
divu= 0 in Q,
u(0) = u0 inT2,(1.1)
on a filtered probability space (Ω ,F,(Ft),P). The quantity µ >0 denotes the fluid viscosity
andu0is a given initial datum. Here ( Wk) are independent real-valued Wiener processes and
σk∈R2are constant vectors.
The motivation for transport noise is twofold:
•In turbulence theory one is often confronted with resolved large-scale, slow-varying,
unresolved small-scale and fast varying components of the velocity field. With the
aim of modelling these effects Holm derived in [14, 25, 26] models with transport noise
in fluid dynamics from a physical perspective.
•Transport noise can have regularisation effects as demonstrated in [19] for the trans-
port equation and very recently in [20] for the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equa-
tions. In fact, it is shown in [20] that the blow up of the solution can be delayed.
Unfortunately, it does not seem possible to restore uniqueness, cf. [24, 30].

Rigorous derivations of stochastic Navier–Stokes equations with transport noise can be found
in [16, 21, 22].
Stochastic forcing. Most of the literature associated with the stochastic Navier–Stokes
equations is concerned with stochastic forcing in the sense of Itˆ o, where the noise can be
additive or multiplicative. In the 2D case classical results are given in [12] and [13], where
the existence of a unique pathwise solution is shown. Also the spatial regularity of solutions
is well-known and can be proved by deterministic estimates, at least in the case of periodic
boundary conditions, see; e.g., [27]. By now many deterministic results on the analysis of
Navier–Stokes equations have found their stochastic counterparts, and the literature on the
numerical approximation is also growing. First convergence rates for the temporal (and
spatio-temporal) approximation of the 2D stochastic Navier–Stokes equations were proved in
[11]. In particular, it was shown that for any ξ >0 and α <1/4

→0 (1.2)
as ∆t→0. This result was eventually improved in [6] to all α <1/2, which seems optimal,
given the low regularity of the driving Wiener process. In (1.2) we denote by umthe solution
to the time-discrete problem with discretisation parameter ∆ t=T/M , and tm=m∆tfor
some M∈Nandm= 1, . . . , M . In this scheme the convective term is treated fully implicitly,
whereas the multiplicative Itˆ o-type noise is treated explicitly. Note that (1.2) is an estimate
for the error with respect to convergence in probability. It seems an intrinsic feature of
SPDEs with non-Lipschitz nonlinearity such as (1.1) that this is the correct error measure
(for first results in this direction see [31]) and that a similar result with respect to mean
square convergence is in general out of reach. However, a convergence rate in mean square
for the 2D stochastic Navier–Stokes equations has been established in [2] with a logarithmic
convergence rate, and in [3] under an assumption concerning the ratio between the viscosity
and the strength of the noise.
Transport noise. From a mathematical point of view the most evident advantage between
stochastic forcing and transport noise as in (1.1) (with solenoidal vector fields σk) is that the
latter conserves energy of each trajectory whereas the former pushes constantly energy into
the system. Under the assumption of constant vector fields the noise does not even effect
estimates in higher order Sobolev norms. Hence one easily obtains pathwise estimates; see
(2.7) below. As far as the time-discretisation is concerned, it is important that a corresponding
algorithm preserves these properties of the continuous solution. With this in mind (and with
u0given) we seek um+1as the solution to

which makes the error analysis much more complicated compared to the Itˆ o-case. We obtain
a discrete counterpart of the uniform-in-probability (higher order) energy estimates, see (3.4)
below. Though (2.7) and (3.4) are just simple observations exploiting the particular structure
of the noise, they have striking consequences: we are able to prove the error estimate

for any α < 1/2; see Theorem 3.1 for the precise statement. Estimate (1.4) yields a con-

previously such a rate was only known for the error with respect to convergence in probability.
In fact, one had to exclude large values of uandum(in a certain norm) by either neglecting
certain sample sets of small probability [6, 11], working with stopping times [7, 8] or truncat-
ing the nonlinearity [31]. Thanks to our pathwise estimates these large values cannot occur
as long as the initial datum is sufficiently regular.
Numerical simulations. In Section 4 we perform numerical simulations for the correspond-
ing problem on bounded domains with no-slip boundary conditions and spatially coloured
noise ( i.e., the driving vector fields σkdepend on space). We implement a finite-element
based space-time-discretisation in the spirit of (1.3). Again, we must solve a nonlinear prob-
lem in each time step to ensure stability of the algorithm. A key question is if one can expect
the same convergence result as for the periodic problem although our theoretical analysis does
not apply anymore. Our numerical experiments provide an affirmative answer to this question
as long as the data (initial condition and driving vector fields) comply with the constraints,
incompressibility and vanishing trace. In fact, our simulations even show that these data
conditions are sharp. If initial velocity and noise datum satisfy the constraints, then velocity
approximations converge with the theoretically predicted rate from (1.4). Conversely, if ei-
ther initial velocity or noise datum does not satisfy the constraints, then this has a decreasing
effect on the convergence rate or it even destroys the convergence.4 D. BREIT, T.C. MOYO, A. PROHL, AND J. WICHMANN

Figure 2. Graphical illustration of the results of SOE–1: empirical approx-
imation (based on 1,000 trajectories) of the stationary distributions of the
kinetic energy for additive ( ), multiplicative ( ) and transport ( )
noise. The deterministic stationary energy level is indicated by a black ( )
vertical line. Details on the numerical simulation are given in Section 4.
Additionally, we investigate the time evolution of the kinetic energy and compare the results
for transport noise with those of the same problem with additive noise and multiplicative
noise, see Figure 1. Different to the latter two cases transport noise is energy-conservative
and thus the kinetic energy is significantly smaller. In fact, transport noise even leads to a
lower mean energy level compared to the deterministic kinetic energy. Initially, dissipation
is dominant for transport noise as can be seen by the absence of fluctuations and small
standard deviations. At the same time as the deterministic solution reaches its stationary
state, randomness becomes more dominant. The same observation follows from a comparison
of the densities of the stationary distributions, see Figure 2. Additive noise exclusively leads
to high energy levels: The density of the stationary distribution attains its maximum at the
deterministic stationary energy level, which seems to be a lower bound for each trajectory’s
energy level. Even if they reach the energy level at an earlier time, they cannot surpass it.
Multiplicative noise leads to fairly centred energy levels with occasional exceptions; and the
energy of transport noise is mostly concentrated below the deterministic one.
2.Mathematical framework
2.1.Tensor calculus. We limit ourselves to 2D space. The system (1.1) is formulated using
standard notations in continuum mechanics. To make the formulation of the problem acces-
sible to all readers we introduce the gradient of a vector field. The gradient of a vector fieldNAVIER–STOKES EQUATIONS WITH TRANSPORT NOISE 5
uis defined to be the second-order tensor
∇u=∂u
∂xj⊗ej=∂ui
∂xjei⊗ej.
In matrix notation,
(2.1) ∇u="
∂u1
∂x1∂u1
∂x2∂u2
∂x1∂u2
∂x2#
.
Using (2.1) the equivalence relation ( ∇u)u= (u·∇)uis obvious. To distinguish between the
products of vectors and matrices we adopt the following notation. Let u∈R2andv∈R2
be two vectors, then u·vdenotes the product of vectors. Next, for A,B∈Rn×nwe use the
notation A:B=B:Ato denote trace (AB⊤), that is, the product of matrices. Let Tbe a
tensor field, the divergence of a tensor is defined to be the vector
divT=∇T:I=∂T
∂xiei=∂(Tjkej⊗ek)
∂xiei=∂Tij
∂xjei (2.2)
For the study of our problem we need the following identity for tensors
div(u⊗v) = (∇u)v+ (div v)u.
2.2.Function spaces. All functions spaces are defined over the two-dimensional torus T2
with respect to periodic boundary conditions and zero mean, i.e.R
T2fdx= 0. We do not
distinguish between scalar- and vector-valued functions. However, vector-valued functions
will usually be denoted in bold case. We denote by Lp(T2) and Wk,p(T2) for p∈[1,∞] and
k∈N, the usual Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces over T2. We consider the subspace W1,p
div(T2)
of divergence-free vector fields which is defined accordingly. The space Lp
div(T2) is defined as
the closure of the set of smooth solenoidal functions in Lp(T2).We will use the shorthand
notations Lp
xandWk,p
xforLp(T2) and Wk,p(T2). For any pair of separable Banach spaces
(X,∥ · ∥X) and ( Y,∥ · ∥Y) with X⊂Y, we write X ,→YifXis continuously embedded in
Y, that is ∥ · ∥Y≤C∥ · ∥X. Here and in what follows, for simplicity, we shall use a generic
positive constant Cwhen computing estimates. It can change its value from line to line.
For a separable Banach space ( X,∥ · ∥ X), we denote by Lp(I;X), the set of (Bochner-)
measurable functions u:I→Xsuch that the mapping t7→ ∥u(t)∥Xbelongs to Lp(I). The
setC(I;X) denotes the space of functions u:I→Xwhich are continuous with respect
to the norm topology on ( X,∥ · ∥ X). For α∈(0,1] we write C0,α(I;X) for the space of
H¨older-continuous functions with values in X. Similarly, for a probability space (Ω ,F,P)
and a separable Banach space ( X,∥ · ∥ X) and p∈[1,∞] we write Lp(Ω,F,P;X) or short
Lp(Ω;X) for the set of (Bochner-) measurable functions v: Ω→Xsuch that the mapping
ω7→ ∥v(ω)∥Xbelongs to Lp(Ω,F,P).
2.3.Probability setup. Let (Ω ,F,(Ft)t≥0,P) be a stochastic basis with a complete, right-
continuous filtration and let ( Wk)K
k=1be mutually independent real-valued standard Wiener
processes relative to ( Ft). We consider smooth solenoidal vector fields σk:T2→R2. If
u∈L2(Ω;L2(0, T;W1,2(T2))) is ( Ft)-adapted the stochastic integrals
Zt
0(σk· ∇)udWk, k = 1, . . . , K
are well-defined in the sense of Itˆ o with values in L2(T2). If we only have u∈L2(Ω;L2(0, T;L2(T2)))
one can use the equality ( σk· ∇)u= div( σk⊗u) and define the stochastic integrals
Zt
0div(u⊗σk) dWk, k = 1, . . . , K6 D. BREIT, T.C. MOYO, A. PROHL, AND J. WICHMANN
with values in W−1,2(T2). We define the Stratonovich integrals in (1.1) by means of the

2.4.The concept of solutions. In two dimensions, pathwise uniqueness for weak solutions is
known; we refer the reader for instance to [29]. Consequently, we may work with the definition
of a weak pathwise solution.
Definition 2.1. Let(Ω,F,(Ft)t≥0,P)be a given stochastic basis with a complete right-continuous
filtration, (Wk)K
k=1being mutually independent real-valued standard Wiener processes relative
to(Ft), and σk∈R2,k= 1, . . . , K . Let u0be anF0-measurable random variable. Then uis

div(T2). Then there exists a unique weak

The proof of this theorem uses the error at integer times em+1:=u(tm+1)−um+1rather
than the arithmetic mean of consecutive errors em+1/2:=1
2(em+1+em), which is in contrast
to the derivation of the discrete stability that relies on the arithmetic mean (see e.g. Equa-
tion (3.2)); this approach in combination with the proper balancing of noise and diffusion (see
Condition (3.5)) then allows control of the stochastic terms.
Proof. Letm∈ {0, . . . , M −1}. Subtracting (3.1) from (2.4) yields the local error equation

Identity (3.7) is a time local error identity, which forms the starting point of our error analysis.
Before we move on to obtain a time global error estimate (by summing the local error identity
for different time instances), we rewrite the first term on the left-hand-side in the desired form
of our claimed Inequality (3.6). To do so, let us recall the following algebraic identity that is
valid for all inner-products (we present it here for vectors a,b∈R2):
(a−b)·a=1

We are ready to move on to the time global error analysis: Let n∈ {1, . . . , M }. We sum the
local error equation (Equation (3.7)) for m∈ {0, . . . , n −1}. Due to the telescopic structureNAVIER–STOKES EQUATIONS WITH TRANSPORT NOISE 11

make sure that the coefficients of the other terms are non-negative. We even impose positivity
of the coefficients, since this allows us to additionally derive error estimates for the gradient

Notice that δ >0 is still to our disposal, which allows us to choose βclose to 2 /3. To do
this rigorously, let ε >0. Now, we use the ansatz β:=2
3−εand check the constraints on δ
that are imposed by the Inequalities (3.11a) and (3.11b). The first inequality imposes δ <ε

The Terms R5(m) and R7(m) enjoy accelerated time convergence since they depend on time

Instead we notice that R6(m) is a centred L2
x-valued random variable. We will use martingale
inequalities to estimate this term eventually.

It remains to check the Cases η= 1 and η= 6. Both rely on the same argument:

4.Numerical simulations
In this section, we conduct two sets of numerical experiments: the first set of experi-
ments (SOE–1) is motivated by the use of different noises for the modelling of stochastic
fluids. While the convergence analysis of our algorithm for additive and multiplicative noises
is left open, we numerically explore the effect of these noise types on the kinetic energy;
the second set of experiments (SOE–2) generates numerical evidence on possible extensions
of Theorem 3.1 to fully discrete algorithms as well as relaxed data assumptions. The main
research questions are:
(a) Can the torus T2be replaced by a Lipschitz domain D ⊂R2?
(b) Can periodic boundary conditions be replaced by no-slip boundary conditions?
(c) Can constant transport fields σk,k= 1, . . . , K , be replaced by non-constant ones?NAVIER–STOKES EQUATIONS WITH TRANSPORT NOISE 21
We implement a fully discrete algorithm based on the time-discretisation (3.1), and combined
with the mixed Finite Element Method with anti-symmetrised (non-)linear convection. We
test the algorithm on various parameter configurations, alternating initial conditions and
transport fields. We monitor the sensitivity of the algorithm with respect to the temporal
discretisation, while keeping the spatial discretisation fixed. This allows us to determine the
algorithm’s temporal rate of convergence experimentally.
The implementation of the algorithm as well as the code used for conducting the exper-
iments is available at https://github.com/joernwichmann/NSE-Transport; it uses the open-
source finite element package Firedrake [23], which itself heavily relies on PETSc [1].
The section is structured as follows: we first introduce the fully discrete algorithm; then we
provide details on the experiments, i.e., we specify concrete choices for the parameters, explain
what solution statistics are collected as well as how the experiments’ data are generated; we
close the section by presenting the results and relating them to the research questions.
4.1.Fully discrete algorithm.
4.1.1. Finite Element Method. Details on the Finite Element Method can be found e.g. in the
books [10, 9, 17] and the references therein. We shortly introduce our notation. Let D ⊂R2
be a Lipschitz domain.
LetThdenote a regular partition (triangulation) of D(no hanging nodes), which consists
of closed n-simplices called elements . For each element ( n-simplex) K∈ Th, we denote by hK
the diameter of K. We define the maximal mesh-size by h:= max K∈ThhK.
Forr∈N0, letPr(K) denote polynomials on Kof degree less than or equal to r; we
define the vector-valued finite element spaces by
Xh:={v∈W1,∞(D) :v|K∈(Pr(K))2∀K∈ Th}, (4.1a)
Vh:=Xh∩W1,2
0(D). (4.1b)
Similarly, we define the scalar-valued finite element spaces by
Yh:={q∈L∞(D) :q|K∈Pr(K)∀K∈ Th}, (4.2a)
Qh:=Yh∩
q∈L∞(D) :Z
Dqdx= 0
. (4.2b)
The vector-valued and scalar-valued finite element spaces are the approximate spaces for
velocity and pressure, respectively. Additionally, the spaces VhandQhincorporate no-slip
boundary conditions for the velocity and mean-value free condition for the pressure, respec-
tively. The space of discretely divergence-free velocity is given by:
V◦
h:=
v∈Vh:∀q∈QhZ
Ddivvqdx= 0
.
A mixed finite element pair ( Vh, Qh) is called stable if the so-called Ladyshenskaya–Babuska–
Brezzi (LBB) condition is satisfied, i.e., there exists a constant β >0 (independent of h) such
that
inf
q∈Qh\{0}sup
v∈Vh\{0}R
Ddivvqdx
∥∇v∥L2x∥q∥L2x≥β. (LBB)
The (LBB) condition is a necessary condition for showing well-posedness of mixed formula-
tions. Without it, it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct the pressure once the velocity has
been constructed.22 D. BREIT, T.C. MOYO, A. PROHL, AND J. WICHMANN
4.1.2. Recovering the energy identity. We have seen that the analytic and semi-discrete solu-
tions satisfy pathwise energy identities; see (2.5) and (3.2). However, these identities heavily
rely on the incompressibility of the solutions uand (um)M
m=1, and the transport fields σk,
k= 1, . . . , K . Mixed finite elements generally fail to preserve the (pointwise) incompressibil-
ity constraint, which hinders an extension of the pathwise energy identities to fully discrete
algorithms. We recover the energy identity by replacing the tri-linear term
B(u,v,w) :=Z
D(u· ∇)v·wdx, u∈L∞(D), v,w∈W1,2(D)
with
C(u,v,w) :=1
2Z
D(u· ∇)v·wdx−1
2Z
D(u· ∇)w·vdx. (4.3)
This approach was originally introduced by Temam in [33]. Most importantly, C(u,·,·) is anti-
symmetric independently of the incompressibility of the transport field u. Additionally, the
change has no effect for incompressible transport fields that vanish on the boundary; indeed, if
divu=0anduvanishes on the boundary, then integration by parts shows that B(u,v,w) =
C(u,v,w) for all v,w∈W1,2(D).
4.1.3. The algorithm. Let ( Vh, Qh) be a stable mixed finite element pair. The fully dis-
crete algorithm reads as follows: Iteratively construct the sequence of approximate veloc-
ity (uh

m=1⊂Vhand pressure ( πh

same way as for the semi-discretisation (3.1). Moreover, the approximate velocity satisfies
the same pathwise energy identity as the solution to the semi-discretisation, which can be
seen by choosing φh=uh
m+1/2in (4.4a). Indeed, this choice yields

is monotonically decreasing. The enhanced energy consists of two terms: the kinetic energy
and an algorithmically induced energy. Since the algorithmically induced energy is scaled by
the time step size, it will become negligible eventually.
4.2.Experiment setup. The presentation of this section follows Section 7 of the last author’s
article [28].NAVIER–STOKES EQUATIONS WITH TRANSPORT NOISE 23
Figure 3. Triangulation of the unit square that is used in all experiments.
4.2.1. Model parameters. We use the following fixed model parameters:
•two-dimensional unit square D= (0,1)2;
•final time T= 1;
•viscosity µ= 1;
•single stochastic transport field K= 1.
4.2.2. Spatial discretisation. We discretise space with Taylor–Hood elements – a stable mixed
finite element pair; see e.g. [32] – generated by the triangulation presented in Figure 3. The
pair consists of continuous velocity and continuous pressure approximate spaces, which are
given by (4.1a) and (4.2a) with r= 2 and r= 1, respectively. Taylor-Hood elements are
merely discretely divergence free; thus, generally violating the incompressibility constraint.
4.2.3. Sampling strategy. We employ a Monte-Carlo approach for the discretisation of the
probability space.
LetM, L∈Nbe the number of time-steps and samples, respectively. Realisations of the
random vector (∆ mW(ωℓ))M
m=1,ℓ= 1, . . . , L , are replaced by
Zℓ
m≈∆mW(ωℓ), m = 1, . . . , M, ℓ = 1, . . . , L, (4.5)
which are generated independently by a pseudo-random number generator.
4.2.4. Implemented algorithm. We slightly modify the setting in (4.4) by adding a determin-
istic force f. Given an initial condition u0, a noise coefficient σand a deterministic forcing f,
we implement the fully discrete system of equations:
•(Initialise) For all ℓ= 1, . . . , L , setuℓ

•(Time-stepping) For all m= 0, . . . , M −1 and ℓ= 1, . . . , L , define uℓ

–(transport noise) Ξ( σ,u,φ) =C(σ,u,φ) where Cis given by (4.3) or
–(no noise) Ξ( σ,u,φ) =0.
The proposed fully discrete algorithm uses a semi-implicit time stepping scheme, which re-
quires us to solve a quadratic non-linear system of equations in each iteration. While this
increases the solving time, we gain more control on the generated velocity approximation due
to the pathwise energy identity. Designing efficient solvers for non-linear system of equations
is in itself an important research field. However, it isn’t the scope of this article to discuss
the algorithm’s solve step; instead we assume the solve is done by an oracle. Later we will
give details on the oracle used in our numerical simulations.
4.2.5. Monitored statistics. Motivated by Theorem 3.1, we exclusively trace the dependence
of velocity and pressure on the time resolution either expressed in terms of the number of
steps M, or the step size ∆ t=T/M . We monitor two statistics: kinetic energy evolution and
time convergence.
We will trace the time evolution of the expected kinetic energy

pressure distances:

The velocity distances are the natural extensions of the error measures introduced in Theo-
rem 3.1. It should be noted, the time convergence in the pressure is still an open problem. The
observation of the pressure distances provides us with numerical evidence for convergence.
Numerically, the kinetic energy as well as the velocity and pressure distances are inacces-
sible for two reasons: expectations can only be computed approximately and the analytic
solution is unknown. We overcome these issues by using an empirical approximation of ex-
pectations and replacing the analytic solution by a more refined approximation.
4.2.6. Lifting vectors to functions. The dependence of the function spaces on the time resolu-
tion can be removed by first lifting vectors to functions and afterwards comparing functions
instead of vectors.
LetEbe a vector space and M∈N. Let U= (um)M
m=0withum∈Efor all m∈ {0, . . . , M }.

mation at a fixed time resolution and the (unknown) analytic solution, we replace the analytic
solution by a more refined approximation.

4.2.9. Simultaneous sampling on different time scales. We need to ensure that coarse and
fine approximates are computed on the same pseudo-random event. Notice that the pseudo-
random numbers defined in (4.5) depend on the time resolution. In particular, different time
resolutions cannot be sampled independently, as can be seen on the analytic level: the random
vectors
(∆mW)Mc
m=1 and (∆ mW)Mf
m=1
are correlated, requiring us to modify the generation of the pseudo-random numbers to account
for dependencies on different time scales. If Mf=rMcfor some r∈N, then we can write
the coarse increments in terms of the fine ones, yielding a simple reconstruction rule:
Zℓ,c
m=rX
n=1Zℓ,f
(m−1)r+n, m = 1, . . . , M c, ℓ= 1, . . . , L. (4.10)
In other words, the fine pseudo-random numbers fully determine the values of the coarse ones.26 D. BREIT, T.C. MOYO, A. PROHL, AND J. WICHMANN

4.2.10. Varying parameters. We run two sets of experiments: the time evolution of kinetic
energy for different noise types and the algorithm’s time convergence for transport noise.
Before we can state the chosen parameters in each experiment, we need to introduce some
vector fields and operators.
Let
Poly( x, y) =
x2(1−x)2(2−6y+ 4y2)y
−y2(1−y)2(2−6x+ 4x2)x
,
Poly noBC(x, y) = Poly( x, y) +1
1
,
Poly noDiv(x, y) = Poly( x, y) +x(1−x)y(1−y)
x(1−x)y(1−y)
.
The first vector field is smooth, divergence-free and vanishes on the boundary of D. The sec-
ond and third vector fields violate boundary conditions and the incompressibility constraint,
respectively. Moreover, let
Trig( x, y) =sin(2πx) sin(4 πy)
−sin(4πx) sin(2 πy)
.
This vector field is smooth and vanishes on the boundary; but it isn’t incompressible.
Additionally, we use the L2-projection onto discretely divergence free velocity with vanish-
ing trace given by
L2
x∋w7→Pvel
hw:= arg min
v∈V◦
h∥v−w∥L2x.
We access this projection by implementing the discrete Helmholtz decomposition Ph=
(Pvel
h,Ppre
h) :L2(D)→Vh×Qhdefined by
∀φh∈Vh:Z
DPvel
hw·φhdx−Z
DPpre
hwdivφhdx=Z
Dw·φhdx,
∀qh∈Qh:Z
DdivPvel
hwqhdx = 0.
The first component of this vector-valued operator is the aforementioned L2-projection; the
second component is the projection onto discrete gradients.
SOE–1: Experimental time evolution of kinetic energy for different noise types. The first
set of experiments investigate the influence of different noise types on the kinetic energy.
We conduct four experiments by switching between additive, multiplicative, transport or
no noise. In Table 1 we present noise coefficients used for each noise type. In all cases, we
choose the same noise datum, initial condition and deterministic forcing. We project them
to the space of discrete velocities by calling the firedrake.project function, which we treat as
a blackbox. The noise datum equals the vector field Poly scaled by the factor 103; the initial
condition is set to be the L2-projection of the vector field Poly onto the space of discretely
divergence-free velocity. We additionally scale the initial velocity by a factor of 103; theNAVIER–STOKES EQUATIONS WITH TRANSPORT NOISE 27

SOE–2: Experimental time convergence for transport noise. The second set of experiments
test the algorithm’s time convergence for different choices of initial conditions and noise data.
In Table 2 we state our choice of initial velocity and noise datum in each experiment.
We project initial velocity and noise datum to the space of discrete velocities by calling the
firedrake.project function. In Experiments 1, 2 and 3 we additionally invoke the L2-projection
to project the initial condition onto the space of discretely divergence-free velocity. Finally,
the noise datum is scaled by a factor of 103in all experiments and no deterministic forcing
(f= 0) is present.
4.2.11. Summary. We are ready to present the algorithm used for the sample generation
of approximate velocity and pressure, the computation of the (mean) kinetic energy, and
the time convergence test for velocity and pressure. The implementation is available at
https://github.com/joernwichmann/NSE-Transport.
The spatial discretisation is fixed in all experiments (see Section 4.2.2). The first set of
experiments SOE–1 uses M= 29time steps and a sample size of L= 105. The second set of
experiments SOE–2 uses a fine time resolution of Mf= 29time steps, coarse time resolutions
ofMc∈ {22,23, . . . , 28}time steps and a sample size of L= 104.

For actually solving (4.6), we rely on the firedrake.solve function that internally uses the
nonlinear solver PETSc.SNES with 10−8as absolute and relative tolerance parameters, and
the parallel sparse direct solver MUMPS .
4.3.Results.
4.3.1. SOE–1: Kinetic energy. The influence of different types of noise (additive, multiplica-
tive, transport and no-noise) on the kinetic energy are shown in Figures 1, 2 and 4: Figure 1
displays the time evolution of individual energy trajectories as well as their statistics (empirical
mean and standard deviation); Figure 2 shows an empirical approximation of the stationary
distributions; and Figure 4 illustrates the effect of each noise structure on the kinetic energy
evolution and its stationary distribution individually. We summarize our observations:
The deterministic system monotonically dissipates its kinetic energy until it reaches its
stationary state, indicated by the constant energy level of around 0 .042 at time 0 .13.
Transport noise leads to a lower mean kinetic energy compared to the deterministic energy:
it is scaled by a factor of approximately 1 /3. Initially, dissipation is dominant for transport
noise as can be seen by the absence of fluctuations and small standard deviations. At the
same time as the deterministic solution reaches its stationary state, randomness becomes more
dominant (the standard deviation is approximately 0 .008). Overall, the energy of trajectories
rarely overcomes the deterministic stationary energy level.
Multiplicative noise leads to a higher mean energy level compared to the deterministic one:
it is scaled by a factor of approximately 3. We observe an initial mean energy peak, which
is caused by rare trajectories with high energy levels. Large standard deviations indicate
dominant stochastic behaviour for short times. After some time, the energy is dissipated
and eventually reaches its stationary level at time 0 .32. Its stationary distribution is almost
symmetrically distributed (with respect to a logarithmic scale) around the deterministic sta-
tionary energy level. Even though reaching the stationary state, many fluctuations in the
mean energy are still visible, which indicate sensitivity of the empirical approximation with
respect to rare events. Its standard deviation is approximately 0 .1.
Additive noise leads to a substantially higher mean energy compared to the no-noise case:
it is scaled by a factor of approximately 12. Right from the start, dissipation dominants the
energy dynamics. While the deterministic solution reaches its stationary state, randomness
becomes more influential (the standard deviation is approximately 0 .4). The density of the
stationary distribution attains its maximum at the deterministic stationary energy level, which
seems to be a lower bound for each trajectory’s energy level. Even if they reach the energy
level at an earlier time, they cannot surpass it.
4.3.2. SOE–2: Time convergence. The results of the time convergence experiments are pre-
sented in Figure 5: it displays the time convergence of velocity, gradient of velocity, pressure,
and time-integrated pressure. We observed the following:
Velocity convergence on L2 
Ω;L∞(0, T;L2(D))
fails in all experiments but Experiment 1.
In this case, interestingly, we also observe an accelerated convergence of rate 1 instead of
the theoretically predicted rate 0 .5. Experiments 1, 2 and 5 show velocity convergence on
L2 

with rate 0 .6, 0.2 and 0 .33, respectively. Initially, Experiment 1
reports velocity convergence with rate 0 .8, which eventually reduces to 0 .4. No convergence
is detected in Experiments 3 and 4.

gence is restored on the weaker norm L2 

4.4.Conclusions. Different noises lead to different dynamics of the kinetic energy and different
stationary distributions. While the dynamics in cases of transport and additive noise are
controlled at all times by the energy dissipation, the multiplicative noise seems to be largely
influenced by random effects and rare events; especially at short times. The densities of
the stationary distributions show that additive noise exclusively leads to high energy levels
(compared to the deterministic stationary energy level); multiplicative noise leads to fairly
centred energy levels with occasional exceptions; and the energy of transport noise is mostly
concentrated below the deterministic one. Depending on the modelling of the given situation
it seems physically reasonable to choose a noise which does not affect the energy balance.1
1In some complex situations such as weather forecast it might also be beneficial to consider a combination
of additive and transport noise.NAVIER–STOKES EQUATIONS WITH TRANSPORT NOISE 31
Since the energy is below the deterministic one in the case of transport noise there must be
more dissipation. However, we currently do not understand the mechanism behind this.
In the beginning of this section we asked: (a) can the torus be replaced by a Lipschitz
domain, (b) can periodic boundary conditions be replaced by no-slip boundary conditions
and (c) can constant transport fields be replaced by non-constant ones? Our numerical
experiments provide an affirmative answer to these questions as long as the data (initial
condition and noise datum) comply with the constraints, which are incompressibility and
vanishing trace. In fact, our simulations even show that these data conditions are sharp: if
initial velocity and noise datum satisfy the constraints, then velocity approximations converge
with the theoretically predicted rate of Theorem 3.1.
Conversely, if either initial velocity or noise datum does not satisfy the constraints, then
this has a decreasing effect on the convergence rate or it even destroys the convergence.
Interestingly, our simulations don’t provide numerical evidence for the necessity of As-
sumption (3.5). The transport field and viscosity, which we used in the time convergence
experiments, violate this assumption by several orders of magnitude (Γ σ≈106≫1 =µ).
Still, we observe convergence, numerically. Therefore, we ask: is it possible to rigorously
establish the convergence of our proposed algorithm without assuming (3.5)?
In some experiments we observe convergence of pressure on L2 
Ω;W−1,2(0, T;L2(D))
. A
theoretical explanation of this convergence has not been derived yet and is an interesting
topic for future research. Only recently, related results for fully discrete algorithms for the
stochastic Stokes system (no convection) forced by multiplicative noise have been derived by
Feng, Vo and the third author [18]. In this case, they established an error estimate of pressure
onL2 
Ω;W−1,2(0, T;L2(D))
with rate 0 .5, which coincides with our experimentally observed
convergence rate. Whether their methods can also be applied for the Navier–Stokes equations
remains to be investigated. From an analytical point of view, the regularity of the pressure is
the most important prerequisite for the occurrence of pressure convergence. In [34], the last
author proved for generalized Stokes systems (the classical Stokes system is included) with
multiplicative noise that pressure is more regular than L2 
Ω;W−1,2(0, T;L2(D))
: in fact,
pressure almost belongs to the space L2 
Ω;W−1/2,2(0, T;L2(D))
. The differentiability gap
between the spaces, in which the convergence is measured and the regularity is available, can
be made arbitrarily close to 0 .5. For specific algorithms, this gap can be used to verify the
convergence of pressure, ultimately leading to a theoretically justified pressure convergence
with rate 0 .5 as done in [18]. In this article, we experimentally observe pressure convergence
for almost all experiments in SOE–2. Therefore, it seems natural to ask: what are sufficient
conditions for the initial condition and the noise coefficient such that pressure is regular?
