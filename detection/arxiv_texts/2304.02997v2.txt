The seesaw mechanism with three right-handed neutrinos has one as a well-motivated dark matter
candidate if stable and the other two can explain baryon asymmetry via the thermal leptogenesis
scenario. We explore the possibility of introducing additional particles to make the right-handed
neutrino dark matter in thermal equilibrium and freeze out through a forbidden annihilation channel.
Nowadays in the Universe, this forbidden channel can be reactivated by a strong gravitational
potential such as the supermassive black hole in our galaxy center. The Fermi-LAT gamma ray
data and dark matter relic density require this right-handed neutrino dark matter to have mass
below 100 GeV and the existence of an additional boson ϕthat can be tested at future lepton
colliders.
Introduction – The heavy right-handed Majorana
neutrinos are widely considered as a key ingredient be-
yond the Standard Model of particle physics. They ex-
plain not only the observed tiny neutrino masses via the
seesaw mechanism [1–4], but also the Universe’s baryon
asymmetry through leptogenesis [5]. Normally, we as-
sume three heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHN). How-
ever, two heavy Majorana neutrinos are sufficient to
explain the observed neutrino oscillation data and the
baryon asymmetry in our Universe [6–10]. One remain-
ing right-handed neutrino can be either very heavy or
very light [11–15]. In this letter, we explore the latter
option that provides us with interesting consequences at
low energies.
If the remaining right-handed neutrino is as light as
O(100) GeV, it can be a good candidate of dark matter
(DM) [13–18]. However, we have strong constraints from
cosmic microwave background (CMB) if they annihilate
into the SM particles and the subsequent electromagnetic
energy injection affects the ionization history of the uni-
verse [19–29]. Therefore, we consider a forbidden-type
DM [30–33] whose freeze-out production is through the
annihilation channel to a heavier dark sector partner or
SM particles. In other words, DM annihilation is kine-
matically forbidden. The only way out is the thermal
energy that can overcome the mass difference between
the initial and final states. This can happen at the early
Universe but ceases when the temperature cools down
with the Universe expansion. Around the last scatter-
ing of CMB photons, the temperature has dropped to eV
scale which is negligibly small for any reasonable forbid-
den DM model. So forbidden DM can avoid those CMB
constraints.
Without annihilation at present time, it is very difficult
for observation to verify the existence of this forbidden
scenario. The indirect detection is intrinsically forbidden.
Interestingly, a strong gravitational source, such as a su-
permassive Black Hole (SMBH), can reactivate the for-
bidden DM and make the DM annihilate around it [34].The subsequent decay of forbidden channel final states
into SM particles, especially visible photons, can give a
unique indirect detection signature today. The gamma
ray from the DM forbidden annihilation only appears in
the vicinity around the SMBH, but not anywhere else in
the sky. A naive fit with the Fermi-LAT data for Sgr A*
shows quite good sensitivity on the thermally averaged
annihilation cross section there.
Although the Fermi-LAT constraint is consistent with
the DM relic density requirement with naive assignments,
a concrete model is necessary to demonstrate the realistic
possibility of constructing such a forbidden DM theory.
In this paper, we show our right-handed neutrino DM
model and its parameter space to generate the correct
DM relic density and at the same time provide reacti-
vated annihilation signal. Comparing with the Fermi-
LAT data, we find the right-handed neutrino DM mass
is below 100 GeV and the presence of an additional boson
ϕis required in the almost same mass region. Finally, we
point out that the possible test at future lepton collider.
The Right-Handed Neutrino Forbidden DM –
We assume a Z2parity acting only on the right-handed
neutrino Nto decouple it from all the SM particles.
Then, Nbecomes stable and a good DM candidate [35]
(If it is the case, we have an anthropic reason for the
presence of three families of quarks and leptons [36].)
However, its production is uncertain since it decouples
completely from the SM particles. It may be produced
in the early Universe through interactions with unknown
heavy particles, but its abundance is undetermined by
low energy physics.
A possible solution is to introduce a fermion χand a
boson ϕto couple with the DM N,ϕNχ. Notice here that
all fermions, Nandχ, are left-handed two component
Weyl fermions. The DM neutrino Nis assumed to carry
odd parity under the Z2. Ifϕis even (and χis odd), it
can couple to a pair of the SM Higgs bosons, HandH†,
viaϕH†H. Thus, the interaction Lagrangian is,
Lint= (yϕNχ +h.c.) +λmϕϕH†H, (1)arXiv:2304.02997v2  [hep-ph]  8 Nov 20232
where mϕis the mass of ϕ. The coupling λwith the SM
Higgs boson renders ϕin thermal equilibrium with the
SM particles in the early Universe.
To maintain equilibrium, the decay rate of ϕto SM
fermions, Γ ∼1
32πλ2m2
fm3
ϕ/(m2
h−m2
ϕ)2, should be larger
than the Hubble constant H∝T2
f/Mplwhere MPl
is the Planck mass. Suppose the ϕdecoupling hap-
pens around Tf∼mϕ/25, thermal equilibrium requires
λ≳(10−8∼10−7) depending on the scalar mass mϕ.
Even lower limit is possible if mϕapproaches the Higgs
mass to reduce the denominator m2
ϕ−m2
hof the decay
width formula. Further through the Yukawa term and
the resulting NN↔ϕϕscatterings, Ncan also get in
the thermal equilibrium.
All these new particles are singlets of the SM gauge
group and have mass terms,
L=mN
2NN+mχ
2χχ+m2
ϕ
2ϕ2. (2)
For a forbidden scenario, the DM mass should be lighter
than its annihilation final-state particles, mN< m ϕ.
Otherwise, the RHN Ncan pairly annihilate into a pair
ofϕat the late time and then ϕdecays to SM particles
through the mixing with the SM Higgs boson. For ϕ
mass larger than O(1) GeV, the dominated decay chan-
nel is ϕ→f¯f, where f=b, τ. Ifϕmass is ≲O(1) GeV,
ϕcan still decay through the di-photon channel ϕ→γγ
that is induced by triangle diagrams in the similar way as
the SM Higgs boson [37]. These processes are strongly
constrained by the CMB [38] and high energy gamma
ray data [39]. Therefore, we concentrate our discussion
on the case that the boson ϕis heavier than the DM N,
mϕ> m N. Although the DM Nmay annihilate into SM
fermions by exchanging a virtual Higgs, NN→ϕ+h∗
andh∗→f¯f, this three-body final state is naturally sup-
pressed by a phase factor 1 /16π2∼10−2and the Yukawa
coupling between Higgs and fermions y2≲10−3. In to-
tal, it has a O(10−5) suppression relative to the two body
annihilation so that the CMB constraint can hardly ap-
ply. We also consider that the mass of χis sufficiently
heavy, mχ> m ϕ+mN, such that χcan decay and does
not contribute to the DM relic density. Below we focus
on the density evolution of the right-handed neutrino for-
bidden DM N.
In the beginning, the DM Nis also in thermal equi-
librium. It gradually freezes out through the forbidden
annihilation channel N+N↔ϕ+ϕby exchanging a
t-channel χ. The number density evolution is governed
by the Boltzmann equation,
˙nN+ 3HnN=−⟨σNNv⟩h
n2
N−(neq
N)2i
, (3)
where nN(neq
N) is the number density of right-handed
neutrino N(in equilibrium). Since the kinematic thresh-
old of the forbidden channel cuts the allowed range of the
center-of-mass energy√s, the total cross section cannoteasily find an analytical formula. It is more convenient
to evaluate the cross section ⟨σϕϕv⟩of the reversed pro-
cessϕϕ→NN first and express ⟨σNNv⟩according to
detailed balance [30],
⟨σNNv⟩ ≡

Being a function of the mass difference δ≡(mϕ−
mN)/mNand temperature parameter x≡mN/T,
the exponential suppression e−2xδcomes from the
ratio of number densities in equilibrium, neq=
g(mT/2π)3/2exp(−m/T), where g= 2 and 1 for Nand
ϕ, respectively. The Boltzmann equation can be solved

cients of the thermally averaged cross section ⟨σϕϕv⟩for
thesandpwaves, ⟨σϕϕv⟩ ≡a+bx−1[40]. The DM relic
density is related to YNas,
ρDM=mNs0YN,ΩDMh2=ρDM
ρc/h2, (6)
where s0= 2891 .2 cm−3is today’s entropy density and
ρc= 1.05×10−5h2GeV/cm3is the critical density of the
Universe.
We also solve the Boltzmann equation numerically
with MicrOMEGAs [41]. The allowed parameter space to
produce the correct relic density Ω DMh2= 0.12 is shown
in Fig. 1. The two key mass parameters of the forbidden
channel are shown in terms of the right-handed neutrino
mass mNand the relative mass difference δas horizontal
and vertical axes, respectively. The whole mN–δparam-
eter space is all allowed by tuning the Yukawa coupling
yto match the DM relic density. In other words, the
value of yis given as a function of mN,δ, and Ω DM. Al-
though the partner fermion χalso has an adjustable mass
mχthat can enter the annihilation cross section, tuning
its value affects the DM relic density in the early Uni-
verse and the reactivated forbidden annihilation at cur-
rent days simultaneously. This resembles the effect of the
Yukawa coupling y. Tuning the value of either Yukawa
coupling yormχis sufficient for our purpose. For sim-
plicity, we take fixed mχ= 2(mϕ+mN) for illustration.
Fig. 1 indicates that the DM relic density naturally limits
its mass within the range of mN≲100 GeV. A smaller
coupling constant yprefers smaller DM mass mNand
mass difference δ. This is because when the annihilation3
cross section becomes smaller, DM freezes out earlier and
its number density becomes larger. Since the DM relic
density is inversely proportional to the annihilation cross
section ⟨σv⟩, it scales with m2
N/y4. A smaller coupling
requires a lighter DM. On the other hand, a smaller mass
difference can increase the annihilation cross section to
compensate the effect of a small coupling.
The Forbidden DM Signature – The forbidden DM
scenario has an intrinsic difficulty of being probed via in-
direct detection. Nowadays, the DM Boltzmann distri-
bution with typical O(100) km/s velocity in our galaxy
can no longer support the forbidden channel. Such a
non-relativistic velocity v∼10−3can only overcome the
mass threshold δ∼v2∼10−6. Although direct detec-
tion and collider experiments may provide complemen-
tary searches and even measure the DM mass, the for-
bidden nature of DM is still missing. In other words, the
theoretical models of forbidden DM can in principle exist
but is not testable. This is a very serious issue.
To reopen the forbidden channel, it is necessary to ac-
celerate the DM particles. Around a black hole, espe-
cially the SMBH in the galaxy center, a particle can be
accelerated to become relativistic because of the strong
gravitational force [34]. This can help the DM Nto anni-
hilate into heavier dark sector particle ϕnear the SMBH.
The unstable ϕthen decays to SM particles through its
mixing with the Higgs particle. The decay products are
either gamma photons or charged particles. While the di-
photon decay channel gives mono-energetic gamma rays
in the ϕrest frame, the charged particles produce pho-
tons through final-state radiation or meson decays with
continuous spectrum. These allow using gamma ray that
can point straightly back to the SMBH as signal for test-
ing our model of right-handed neutrino DM.
The gamma ray intensity highly depends on the
DM density and velocity dispersion profiles around the
SMBH. In our scenario, DM Nhas no self-interaction.
Thus, its density follows the CDM density profile [42].
For the innermost region, r < 4GM≡r0where Mis
the BH mass, all particles are attracted to fall into the
SMBH so that the DM density is 0 therein. On the other
hand, the DM halo simply follows the NFW profile when
the gravitational influence of the SMBH no longer dom-
inates which roughy happens at rb≡0.2GM/v2
0with v0
being the DM velocity dispersion there. In between, a
DM density spike forms,

ρsp(r)ρin(t,r)
ρsp(r)+ρin(t,r), r 0≤r < r b,(Spike),

Naively thinking, the DM density profiles keeps increas-
ing when going towards the SMBH. However, the DM
density cannot increase forever. In addition to self-
interaction, annihilation can also suppresses the growth
of DM density. This naturally puts an upper bound

on the DM density profile and forms a density plateau
around the SMBH. Going inward from the spike re-
gion boundary rb, the DM density profile increases very
fast initially as ρsp(r)≡ρb(rb/r)γspwith γsp≡(9−
2γc)/(4−γc). The density coefficient ρb≡ρD(D/r b)γc
with γc= 1 is scaled according to the NFW profile [43],
ρ(r)∝1/rforr≪26 kpc [44, 45], from the density
around the Solar system with ρD= 0.3 GeV cm−3
andD= 8.5 kpc. When reaching the SMBH vicin-
ity,r≳r0, the DM density increases much slower as
ρin(r, t)≡ρann(t)(r/rin)−γinwith γin= 1/2. The den-
sityρannis the so-called annihilation plateau density
ρann≡mN/⟨σNNv⟩t. With ρ=ρspρin/(ρsp+ρin),
its value approaches ρspforρsp≪ρinandρinin the
opposite. Since ρsp(r)∝r−7/3andρin(r)∝r−1/2, the
DM density profile almost becomes a plateau in the inner
spike region. The division rinatρsp=ρannis determined
by the DM annihilation cross section ⟨σNNv⟩.
In its vicinity, the SMBH dominates the gravitational
potential and consequently the DM velocity dispersion
follows a simple scaling v2
d(r)∼GM/r . In reality,
the DM particles inside the spike region are thermal-
ized to a Juttner distribution [46, 47] Pr(Vr, Vc, x(r))
where Vris the relative velocity and Vcis the centre-
of-mass velocity of a two-particle collision system [34].
To get the energy spectrum of the gamma production

d(r) and dNγ/dEγis the boosted
photon spectrum from ϕdecay. For the mass range
mϕ>10 GeV considered in this paper, the dominate
channels are ϕ→b¯b,τ¯τ, and gg. We use the PPPC4DMID
package [48] to generate the photon spectra of ϕdecay
at rest and HDECAY [49] to obtain the branching ratios.
After that, we boost the spectrum to the galaxy frame
[38, 50].

In principle, the integration upper limit rBshould be as
large as possible to include all contributions. However,
those DM particles at larger radius have a smaller ve-
locity dispersion and consequently only the tail of the
Juttner distribution contributes. To make efficient nu-
merical evaluation, we only include those regions that,

This means that only less than 1% of the DM phase space
can contribute at radius larger than rB.
Indirect Detection with Fermi-LAT – The photon
flux from the forbidden annihilation is localized around
the SMBH. Uniquely identifying the right-handed neu-
trino DM scenario requires not just observing the photon
spectrum but also good angular resolution. The Fermi-
LAT satellite observatory is an all-sky γ-ray telescope
with excellent energy and angular resolutions on the γ-
ray point source from the GC [51, 52]. We analyze a
square region of 10◦×10◦around Sgr A∗and find several
γ-ray point sources, of which 4FGL J1745.6-2859 is the
brightest and closest one to Sgr A∗in the Fourth catalog
of Fermi-LAT sources (4FGL) [53, 54]. This point source
is usually considered as the manifestation of Sgr A∗in the
MeV-to-GeV range [55]. We use 14 years of Fermi-LAT
data from August 4, 2008 to October 26, 2022 in this
paper. To be specific, the Pass 8 SOURCE-class events
from 100 MeV to 1000 GeV are binned to a pixel size of
0.08◦.
A universal model can describe the γ-ray spectrum
from point sources. To be specific, this universal
4FGL J1745.6-2859 spectral model is a log-parabola in
the 4FGL Catalog [53, 54],

, (11)where N0is normalization, E0a scale parameter, αthe
spectral slope at E0, and βthe curvature of the spec-
trum. Since E0does not vary much, its value is fixed
to 4074 MeV in our fit while the other three can freely
adjust.
For a given DM mass mNand mass difference δ, the
Yukawa coupling constant yis fixed by the DM relic den-
sity as explained earlier. This means that the predicted
photon flux around the SMBH is also determined for ev-
ery parameter space point in Fig. 1. We fit the Fermi-
LAT data with the following χ2function,

In each bin, Ndata
i is the data point, Nbkg
ithe back-
ground, NNP
ithe expected events due to new physics
(NP) contribution, and σithe error bar for each data
point.
Fig. 1 shows the 95% C.L. limit as red lines and the re-
gion above are excluded. Since the realistic background
is not determined and the parameters in Eq. (11) are
free, we do the fit in two possible ways. We first fix
the background to its best-fit values obtained from the
background-only hypothesis with N0= 2.519×10−12,
α= 2.489, and β= 0.1553. In this case, the back-
ground model can fit data very well and consequently
the resulting limit on the signal parameters (red solid
line) are quite stringent. The allowed DM mass is be-
low≲60 GeV and the mass difference δcannot be larger
thanO(10−5). For comparison, we also fit the data by
changing both the prediction and background parame-
ters. The corresponding result (red dashed line) allows
much larger parameter space with a mass difference as
large as 10−3. Both methods require the mass difference
within a quite narrow range at the leave of O(10−5) and
O(10−3), respectively for DM mass mN≳30 GeV.
Conclusion and Discussion – In this paper, we pro-
pose a model with dark sector including two Majorana
fermions Nandχ, as well as a Higgs-portal scalar parti-
cleϕ. Among them, the right-handed neutrino Nis the
lightest one and hence can serve as DM. Its freeze-out
production in the early Universe is through the forbid-
den annihilation channel N+N↔ϕ+ϕ. Although
this annihilation channel is nowadays forbidden, it can
reopen around a strong gravitation source. Thus, the
SMBH located at the galaxy center can accelerate Nto
make it annihilate into its heavier partner ϕ. The sub-
sequent decay of ϕto SM particles can bring detectable
photon flux. The current Fermi-LAT data requires the
right-handed neutrino mass mNsmaller than 100 GeV,
and the mass difference O(10−5)≲δ≲O(10−3).
Such a light right-handed neutrino can be tested at fu-
ture lepton colliders such as CEPC [56], ILC [57], FCC-
ee [58], and CLIC [59]. If the masses of Nandχsat-
isfymχ+mN< m h, the SM Higgs particle can de-5
cay invisibly, h→χ+N. For illustration, the pro-
jected sensitivity BrBSM
inv <0.3% at CEPC translates
toλ≲5×10−2. With our parameter assignments,
mϕ> m Nandmχ>2(mN+mϕ), this Higgs invisi-
ble decay constraint applies for mN<25 GeV as shown
with verticle black dashed line in Fig. 1. Besides, the
dark sector particle ϕcan also be directly produced at
future Higgs factories through Higgsstrahlung-like pro-
cesse++e−→Z+ϕ[60–66].
In addition to the current model assignments discussed
in this paper, there is another possibility of removing
the dark sector particle χand assigning the right-handed
neutrino DM Nplay its role. Then the forbidden an-
nihilation NN→ϕϕarises from a much simpler flavor-
conserving Yukawa coupling yϕNN . One side effect of
this model is introducing DM self-scattering NN↔NN
by exchanging a scalar mediator ϕ. Consequently, DM
has much a smaller density profile in the spike region.
This leads to a weaker constraint on the annihilation
cross section [67].
