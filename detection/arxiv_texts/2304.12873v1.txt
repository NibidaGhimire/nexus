Abstract. Bell’s inequality plays an important role with respect to th e Einsteinian
question about the physical reality of quantum theory. Whil e Bell’s inequality
is usually viewed within the geometric framework of a Hilber t space quantum
model, the present note extends the theory of Heisenberg mea surements to quan-
tum systems with representations in general orthogonal geo metric spaces and, in
particular, the Minkowski spaces of relativity theory. A Fe ynmanian numerical
example exhibits two measurements that admit a joint probab ilistic interpretation
in Minkowski space while they are not jointly observable in H ilbert space.
The analysis shows that probabilistic interpretations of q uantum measurements
may depend not only on the measuring instruments and the syst em states but also
on the geometric space in which the measurements are conduct ed. In particu-
lar, an explicit numerical example is given of a Heisenberg m easurement with a
complete set of common observables that violates Bell’s ine quality in Minkowski
space but, mutatatis mutandis , satisﬁes it in Hilbert space.

1 Introduction
In the well-known EPR Gedankenexperiment , Einstein, Rosen and Podolsky [8] ques-
tion the world-view of quantum theory because of missing hidden states that would
imply deterministic properties of particles to be measured . Assuming that propagation
of information cannot exceed the speed of light, a particle s hould be in a well-deﬁned
state, whether it is measured or not. According to quantum th eory, this local realism
may not always be guaranteed. In order to decide the issue, Be ll [2,3] devised an in-
equality and an experiment which quantum theory predicts to violate, Einstein’s view,
however, would expect to satisfy.Bell’s inequality has been tested in various practical expe riments and always found
violated. So the currently held belief in physics is that Ein stein was wrong1. Yet, Bell’s
proposed solution to the EPR objection keeps posing a philos ophical puzzle. Models of
hidden states and extensions of classical statistics to a th eory of quantum statistics have
been developed in order to solve it (see, e.g., [5], [6], [1,15]).
Indeed, things may be not so clear. The derivation of Bell’s i nequality assumes that
a set of pairwise commuting Heisenberg observables, based o n a common deterministic
property of a state, should behave like the marginal process es of an underlying (classi-
cal) stochastic variable. A violation of the inequality wou ld thus be evidence that such
a hidden state cannot exist.
While Bell’s theoretical assumption can be justiﬁed in the s tandard Hilbert space
model of quantum theory, conclusions from pratical experim ents have to be taken with
grains of salt since the experiments are conducted in the env ironment of Minkowski
spaces of relativity theory and not necessarily in pure Hilb ert spaces. So Heisenberg
measurements need to be studied not only in Hilbert but also i n Minkowski space.
The present note provides an extended theoretical model for Heisenberg measure-
ments on (ﬁnite-dimensional) relativistic quantum systems. Such systems do not refer
to special physical systems but to the representation of sys tem states as spacelike events
in Minkowski space or, more generally, in orthogonal geomet ries. Hilbert spaces model
precisely those orthogonal geometries in which the density function of a Heisenberg
measurement is guaranteed to be positive semideﬁnite (whic h justiﬁes Bell’s assump-
tion for his inequality). All other geometric environments (and thus Minkowski spaces
in particular), admit density functions with possibly nega tive values.
So probabilistic conclusions from Heisenberg measurement s must be handled with
care. Their interpretation in abstract Hilbert space may be subject to larger eigenvalue
bounds in Bell’s inequality than in Minkowski space. In fact , the Bell bound depends not
only on the eigenvalues of the Heisenberg measuring matrix b ut also on the geometric
environment of the measurement. A measurement with a comple te set of observables
may violate the (stricter) Bell inequality in Minkowski spa ce while it complies to the
(larger) Bell bound in Hilbert space. In fact, we present a nu merical example of such a
situation in Section 5 below.
Each physical measurement constitutes an interaction betw een the measuring device
and the object to be measured and thus depends on both the prop erties of the measuring
device and on the properties of the object ( cf.Section 4.4). Seeming randomness of
measurement observations could either reﬂect incomplete i nformation on part of the
observer or an inherent randomness on part of the object ( cf.[16]). Or both. The issue
appears open to individual interpretations2.

and matrices (see, e.g., [17]).Rdenotes the ﬁeld of real and Cthe ﬁeld of complex
scalars. As usual, i∈Cis the imaginary unit with the property i2=−1.z=a−ib
is the conjugate of the complex scalar z=a+ ibwitha,b∈R. Wherex∈Cn
is ann-dimensional parameter vector with coordinates xi,xdenotes the vector with
coordinates xi=xi. We think of an element x∈Cntypically as a column vector and
writex∗=xTfor the row vector with the coefﬁcients x∗
i=xi.

3 Relativistic quantum systems
We assume an n-dimensional geometric space G,i.e., ann-dimensional vector space
Vwith the complex ﬁeld Cof scalars, endowed with a (hermitian) scalar product (or
metric )(x|y)such that for all x,y,z∈ V and scalars λ∈C,
(y|x) =(x|y)
(x|y+λz) = (x|y/an}bracketri}ht+λ(x|z).Vectorsx,y∈ Gareorthogonal if(x|y) = 0 . The associated quadric norm onGis the
real-valued function
/bardblx/bardbl2= (x|x) (x∈ V).
If/bardblx/bardbl2≥0, we refer to /bardblx/bardbl=/radicalbig
/bardblx/bardbl2as the length ofxinG. In view of /bardblλx/bardbl=λ/bardblx/bardbl
for all real λ≥0, the characteristic surface
S={x∈ G |(x|x) = 1}
represents the 1-normalized elements of Gof positive length. A system Sis called a
relativistic quantum system if its states are represented by the elements of the charac-
teristic surface Sof a geometric space G.
3.1 Signed decomposition
Relative to the metric of the geometric space G, the Spectral Theorem guarantees the
existence of a basis E={e1,...,en}and indices 0≤r≤s≤nsuch that
(ei|ej) =

0ifi/ne}ationslash=jori > s ,
+1ifi=jandi≤r,
−1ifi=jandr+1≤i≤s.
and hence
/bardblx/bardbl2=|x1|2+...+|xr|2−|xr+1|2−...−|xs|2,
wherex∈Cnis the coordinate vector of xrelative to E. Consequently, Gdecomposes
naturally into the sum
G=V+⊕V−⊕V0
of the pairwise orthogonal subspaces
V0=span{ei|s < i≤n}
V+=span{ei|0< i≤r}
V−=span{ei|r < i≤s}.
Assuming a non-empty characteristic surface S /ne}ationslash=∅, we have V+/ne}ationslash=∅. In view of
S ⊆V+⊕V−,
we furthermore assume s=nwithout loss of generality. So for every x∈ G, there are
unique vectors x+∈V+andx−∈V−such that
x=x++x−and/bardblx/bardbl2=/bardblx+/bardbl2+/bardblx−/bardbl2.Bell Inequality 5
Example 1 (Hilbert spaces) AHilbert space His a geometric space with V+=V
(i.e.,r=n). All elements of a Hilbert space have a nonnegative quadric norm
/bardblx/bardbl2
2=|x1|2+...+|xn|2,
where the xiare the coordinates of xrelative to the basis E. The scalar product of a
Hilbert space is denoted by
/an}bracketle{tx|y/an}bracketri}ht=x1y1+...+xnyn.
For a general geometry Gwith characteristic subspaces V+andV−, the restriction
G+ofGtoV+is a Hilbert space, while V−becomes a Hilbert space relative to the
negative of the scalar product:
/an}bracketle{tx|y/an}bracketri}ht=−(x|y).
Hence the quadric norm of Gcan be expressed in terms of the Hilbert norm:
/bardblx/bardbl2=/bardblx+/bardbl2+/bardblx−/bardbl2=/bardblx+/bardbl2
2−/bardblx−/bardbl2
2. (1)
Example 2 (Minkowski spaces) An (n-dimensional) Minkowski space Mis a geo-
metric space with r=n−1and thus the quadric norm
µ(x) =|x1|2+...+|xn−1|2−|xn|2.
Minkowski spaces yield models for relativity theory where e lementsx∈ M are time
tagged events . Eventsxwith positive norm µ(x)>0arespacelike . For any x∈ M ,
the afﬁne subspace
M(x) ={y∈ M |yn=xn}.
consists of the events with the same time tag xn.
3.2 Isometries, Galilei and Lorentz transformations
Anisometry of the geometry Gis a metric preserving linear operator T:G → G :
(Tx|Ty) = (x|y/an}bracketri}htholds for all x,y∈ G.
Remark 1 An isometry Tcorresponds to a transition to a new reference basis
E′=T(E) ={Te1,...,Ten}={e′
1,...,e′
n}
that exhibits the same geometric structure.The isometries of the Hilbert space Hare the so-called unitary operators. If the
scalars of Hare restricted to the real coefﬁcient ﬁeld R, its isometries are also known
asGaliliei transformations . Unitary operators yield typical examples of isometries in a
general geometry Gas follows:
LetU+andU−be unitary operators on V+andV−respectively, then
Ux=U+x++U−x−
is a unitary isometry of G.
Isometries of Minkowski spaces are Lorentz transformations . A Lorentz transfor-
mation of Mthat ﬁxes the last (time) coordinate, for example, arises fr om a unitary
operator on the n−1dimensional Hilbert space V+in this fashion.
4 Heisenberg measurements
Consider a relativistic quantum system Sin a geometry Gand an×kmatrixWwith
rowsWiand coefﬁcients Wij∈R.Wis the eigenvalue matrix of the measuring instru-
ment to be deﬁned. Any x∈ G with coordinates xirelative to the basis Edecomposes
into a sum of pairwise orthogonal vectors xw:

Wi=wxiei. (2)
With the eigenvalue decomposition (2) of xone associates a density as the function

with the property

Rkdqx(w) =/summationdisplay
wqx(w) = 1 for allx∈ S,
which yields
W(x) =/integraldisplay
Rkw dqx(w) =r/summationdisplay
i=1Wi|xi|2−n/summationdisplay
j=r+1Wj|xj|2.
Remark 2 A density is a signed measure in the sense of mathematical measure theory3.
It can always be expressed as the difference of two nonnegati ve measures, in complete
analogy with (1).
3see,e.g., [7]Bell Inequality 7
AHeisenberg measuring instrument onSis a pairH(W,T)with an eigenvalue ma-
trixWas above and Tan isometry of G.H(W,T)produces ksimultaneously measured
real parameters as the components of the vector
h(x) =W(Tx) = (h1(x),...,h k(x))∈Rk
whenSis in the state x.
Thehj(x)are single-valued Heisenberg measurements of the form H(Wj,T)in
their own right, each with respect to the same isometry T. In this sense, the marginal
Heisenberg measurement functions
x/ma√sto→hj(x) (j= 1,...,k)
constitute a complete set of common observables on the relativistic quantum system S.
Remark 3 Note that the eigenvalue decomposition of xrelative to Wis a common
reﬁnement of the eigenvalue decompositions of xrelative to the kcomponent measure-
ments.
4.1 Matrix representations
With reference to the basis E={e1,...,en}ofV, one may identify any x∈ V with
its vector x∈CnofE-coordinates xi. In particular, an isometry TofGbecomes a
n×nmatrix. Letting
Λ(j)=diag(W1j,...,W nj) (j= 1,...,k),
thekmarginal measurements of the Heisenberg measuring instrum entH(W,T)can
then be expressed in matrix notation as
hj(x) =x∗A(j)xwithA(j)=T∗Λ(j)T. (3)
Note that the matrices A(j)are hermitian, which means that single-valued Heisen-
berg measurements in Gare also Heisenberg measurements in the the standard model
of quantum theory.
Moreover, if Tis a unitary matrix ( i.e., ifT−1=T∗), then the measurement matri-
cesA(j)commute pairwise:
A(j)A(ℓ)=A(ℓ)A(j)for allj,ℓ= 1,...,k. (4)
Remark 4 By the Spectral Theorem, a matrix Ais hermitian if and only if there exist
a real diagonal matrix Λand a matrix Tsuch that A=T∗ΛT.Tdoes not have to be
an isometry.
Example 3 (Observables in Hilbert space) A setA={A(1),...,A(k)}ofkpair-
wise commuting hermitian matrices A(j)admits a representation of type (3) with a
common unitary matrix Tand suitable real diagonal matrices Λ(j).
Any isometry Tof a Hilbert space is described by a unitary matrix. Conseque ntly,
the commutativity condition (4) characterizes complete se ts of common observables in
Hilbert space.4.2 Stochastic interpretations
Say that the Heisenberg measurement H(W,T)ispositive semideﬁnite in the relativistic
quantum state s∈ S if the associated density qTsis nonnegative and, therefore, a
probability distribution. In this case, the measurement ca n be interpreted as the expected
value
E(X) =/integraldisplay
Rkw dqx(w) =W(x)withx=Ts
of a stochastic variable Xwith the probability distribution
Pr{X=w}=qx(w).
Example 4 Heisenberg measurements in Hilbert space are positive semi deﬁnite in any
quantum state and, therefore, always allow the interpretat ion of the measurement result
as an expected value of eigenvalues.
In fact, every Heisenberg measurement admits a stochastic i nterpretation. At least in
principle. To this end, make the eigenvalue matrix Wdepend on the state xand deﬁne
Wxas the modiﬁed matrix with rows

W(x) =n/summationdisplay
i=1Wx
ipi(x) (5)
as the corresponding expected value of the rows of Wx.
Remark 5 While the stochastic model (5) shows that Heisenberg measur ements on
relativistic quantum systems may be analyzed with standard methods of mathematical
statistics, it is of problematic use if one wants to check exp erimentally theoretically pre-
dicted properties which depend on the a priori eigenvalues o f the measuring instrument.
4.3 Measurement functions and hidden states
Ann-dimensional hidden state model of a system Sassumes the existence of a set
Ω={ω1,...,ω n}
ofndeﬁnite (but possibly ”hidden”) ground states ωi. In this context, a measurement
function is just a function
X:Ω→R.
A(general) state ofSis a linear superposition of ground states and thus correspo nds
to a coefﬁcient vector s∈Cn. Within appropriate geometries, these coefﬁcient vectors
obey certain metrics. The particular superposition of the g round states is thought to
govern stochastic aspects of the measurement viaX. Thus, general states are typically
normalized to length /bardbls/bardbl= 1relative to the relevant geometry.Bell Inequality 9
Example 5 The standard model of quantum computation (cf.[19]) is a hidden state
model. It assumes a Hilbert space as its geometric environme nt.
Feynman [13] (see also [21]) describes a spin 1/2system with 4ground states
ω1,ω2,ω3,ω4. Assume that XandYmeasure the spin around the x−and they−axis
relative to the ground states with the returns
ω1ω2ω3ω4
X−1−1 +1 +1
Y−1 +1−1 +1,(6)
which corresponds to the Heisenberg measurement matrices
A=diag(−1,−1,+1,+1)
B=diag(−1,+1,−1,+1).
It can be argued that the following observation probabiliti es are possible:
Pr{X= +1}= 1/4,Pr{X=−1}= 3/4
Pr{Y= +1}= 0,Pr{Y=−1}= 1.
It is easy to see that there is no 4-dimensional Hilbert space quantum state that
would imply these probabilities. However, the relativisti c quantum state
s= (/radicalbig
5/8,/radicalbig
1/8,/radicalbig
3/8,/radicalbig
1/8)
in4-dimensional Minkowski space (with metric (x|y)) is positive semideﬁnite for the
eigenvalue matrix
W=/bracketleftbigg−1−1−1 +1
−1 +1−1 +1/bracketrightbiggT
.
SoXandYare jointly observable in the (Minkowski) state swith the probabilities as
above and the expected values
E(X) = (s|As) =−1/2andE(Y) = (s|B) =−1.
Since/bardbls/bardbl2=√
5/2, an interpretation as a joint measurement in Hilbert space
according to (5) would re-scale sto the vector
˜s=s
/bardbls/bardbl2=2s√
5of Hilbert norm /bardbl˜s/bardbl2= 1.
With the re-scalded measurement matrices
A′′=diag(−√

B′′=diag(−√

one then computes relative to ˜sin Hilbert space:
/an}bracketle{t˜s|A′′˜s/an}bracketri}ht= (s|As) =E(X)and/an}bracketle{t˜s|B′′˜s/an}bracketri}ht= (s|Bs) =E(Y).4.4 Interactions and Schr ¨odinger type evolutions
Ann-dimensional interaction system assumes patterns of pairwise interactions of npar-
ticlesi,jthat are described by (real) interaction coefﬁcients Jij. An interaction pattern
is thus represented by an n×nreal matrix J.Jhas a unique decomposition
J=J(0)+J(1)
into a symmetric matrix J(0)and a skew-symmetric matrix J(1), which gives rise to a
(complex) hermitian matrix
ˆJ=J(0)+iJ(1). (7)
In fact, (7) establishes an isomporphism between the vector space of all real n×nma-
trices and the space of all hermitian n×nmatrices (over the real ﬁeld R). So any her-
mitiann×nmatrixAreﬂects the superposition of a symmetric and a skew-symmetr ic
interaction pattern of nparticles. Consequently,
x∗Ax=/summationdisplay
i,jAijxixj
is the total value of interaction if the particles iinteract with intensity levels xiaccording
to the pattern represented by A.
LetTbe an isometry of the geometric space Gand consider for the relativistic state
x∈ S the sequence of values
ϕt(x) =x∗[(Tt)∗ATt]x= (Ttx)∗A(Ttx) (t= 0,1,...) (8)
This sequence admits interpretations that are dual to each o ther. The Schr ¨odinger
picture suggests a constant interaction pattern Arelative to an evolution of states
x0,x1,...,xt,xt+1... withxt+1=Txt.
The Heisenberg picture , on the other hand, sees an evolution of interaction pattern s
relative to a constant state x:
A0,A1,...,A t,At+1,... withAt+1=T∗AtT.
Either way, and without any assumptions on a probabilistic n ature of a Heisenberg
measurement, one can derive ( cf.[12]) the analogue of von Neumann’s theorem :
(•)The sampling averages of the ϕt(x)converge if the Hilbert norm of Tis bounded.
Remark 6 The idea of pairwise interaction is fundamental in a wide var iety of mathe-
matical application models ( cf.[10]).Bell Inequality 11
5 The Bell inequality
We ﬁrst note an inequality that goes back to Bell [2] for sets o f sets of three common
Heisenberg observables. We deﬁne the Bell number of the corresponding eigenvalue
matrixW∈Rn×3as its maximum norm
|W|∞= max
ij|Wij|.
Letsbe a member of some n-dimensional geometry Gwith quadratic norm
/bardbls/bardbl2=n/summationdisplay
i=1gi|si|2= 1 wheregi∈ {−1,+1}
and the associated density relative to W:
qs(x,y,z) =/summationdisplay
Wi=(x,y,z)gi|si|2.
We consider the measurement values
W(XY) =/summationdisplay
Wi=(x,y,z)xy gi|si|2=/summationdisplay
(x,y,z)∈R3xy qs(x,y,z)
W(YZ) =/summationdisplay
Wi=(x,y,z)yz gi|si|2=/summationdisplay
(x,y,z)∈R3yz qs(x,y,z)
W(XZ) =/summationdisplay
Wi=(x,y,z)xz gi|si|2=/summationdisplay
(x,y,z)∈R3xz qs(x,y,z).
Lemma 1. If the density qsis nonnegative, then the measurements satisfy the inequali ty
|W(XY)−W(YZ)|+W(XZ)≤ |W|2
∞. (9)
Proof. Any row triplet (x,y,z)∈Wsatisﬁes the inequality
|xy−yz|+xz≤W2
∞.
Ifqsis nonnegative, and hence a probability distribution on the nrows ofW, the mea-
surement values are the corresponding expectations of the c omponent products, which
implies
|W(XY)−W(YZ)|+W(XZ)≤W(|XY−YZ|+XZ)≤W2
∞.
/squaresolid
Lemma 1 immediately yields:
Theorem 2 (Bell inequality). LetW∈Rn×3be an eigenvalue matrix of a Heisenberg
measurement and x∈ Sa relativistic quantum state with a nonnegative density fun ction
qx. LetX,Y,Z be the associated stochastic component variables so that
W(x) =/integraldisplay
R3w dqx(w) = (E(X),E(Y),E(Z)).Then the expected values of the pairwise products satisfy th e inequality
|E(XY)−E(YZ)|+E(XZ)≤ |W|2
∞. (10)
For an illustration of the Bell inequality in the Minkowski s paceM5relative to the
coordinate space C5, consider the three hermitian and pairwise commuting measu re-
ment matrices
A=diag(−1,+1,+1,+1,+1)
B=diag(−1,+1,−1,−1,+1)
C=diag(−1,−1,−1,+1,+1)
with the Bell bound |W|∞= 1on the eigenvalues. For any x∈ M , one has
(Ax)5= (Bx)5= (Cx)5=x5.
So an associated Heisenberg measurement Hwith the identity T=Ias the trivial
isometry and components
h(x) = (x∗Ax,x∗Bx,x∗Cx)
takes place in the 4-dimensional subspace M5(x)of events with the same time tag.
There is no time loophole to be considered. For a concrete example, ﬁx
s=√
3
3(1,1,1,1,1).
Becauseµ(s) = 1 ,srepresents a relativistic quantum state in M5. Moreover, each pair
of measurements is positive semideﬁnite in the state s. For the expected values of the
pairwise products of the corresponding stochastic variabl esX,Y,Z , one computes
E(XY) =−1/3, E(XZ) = +1, E(YZ) =−1,
which violates the Bell inequality however:
|E(XY)−E(YZ)|+E(XZ) = 2/3+1>1 =|W|2
∞.
This shows that the hypothesis of positive semideﬁnitenes o f the joint measurement
ofallthree measurements in Theorem 2 cannot be dropped in general .hrepresents a
complete set of three common observables. Yet, his not positive semideﬁnite for the
complete set in the state s.
In view of /bardbls/bardbl2
2= 5/3, on the other hand, the stochastic Hilbert space measuremen t
model (5) refers to the measurement matrices
A′′=diag(−5/3,+5/3,+5/3,+5/3,−5/3)
B′′=diag(−5/3,+5/3,−5/3,−5/3,−5/3)
C′′=diag(−5/3,−5/3,+5/3,+5/3,−5/3)Bell Inequality 13
with the Bell number |W′′|∞= 5/3. For the corresponding stochastic variables X′′,
Y′′,Z′′, one obtains
E(X′′Y′′) =E(X′′Z′′) =E(Y′′Z′′) = 25/9,
which satisﬁes the pertaining Bell inequality
|E(X′′Y′′)−E(Y′′Z′′)|+E(X′′Z′′) = 25/9 =|W′′|2
∞.
Remark 7 The example in the present section shows that a seeming viola tion of the
Bell inequality may result from the stochastic interpretat ion of the measurement model
and the geometric environment in which the measurement is ca rried out. It is not nec-
essarily an indication of an underlying physical reality pe r se.
6 Final Remarks
The facts that the Minkowski norm may take on negative values and that densities are
signed measures makes it natural to study physical phenomen a with a stochastic ap-
pearence in mathematical models where the descriptive para meters can be ”negative
probabilities”. Although still not standard in quantum the ory, this modeling approach
was already taken by Wigner [24] and recommended by Feynman [ 13] (see also [4,21],
for instance).
A fundamental model in applied statistics assumes that stoc hastic phenomena are
sequentially observed according to a Markov chain with inte rnal and possibly hidden
states ( cf.([9]). Markov chains do not appear to ﬁt under the umbrella of Schr¨ odinger
quantum state evolutions. Permitting ”negative probabili ties”, however, one is lead to a
unifying theory of statistical evolutions.
The statistical model [11], for example, admits stochastic processes that are de-
scribed by evolutions under the action of Riesz operators on Banach spaces. Riesz mea-
surements generalize Heisenberg measurements. Moreover, mean ergodic evolutions
can be characterized in this generality. Classical Markov c hains and quantum random
walks ( cf.[22]) as well as (discrete) Schr¨ odinger evolutions ﬁt into this context as spe-
cial cases. Similarly, the theory of quantum information an d computing ( cf.[19]) ap-
pears to extend accordingly. (The algebraic model [14] for a statistical generalization
of Schr¨ odinger evolutions seems to aim into a different dir ection.)
