The dark matter puzzle is one of the most important open problems in modern physics. The
ultra-light axion is a well-motivated dark matter candidate, conceived to resolve the strong-CP
problem of quantum chromodynamics. Numerous precision experiments are searching for the three
non-gravitational interactions of axion-like dark matter. Some of the searches are approaching
fundamental quantum limits on their sensitivity. This Perspective describes several approaches
that use quantum engineering to circumvent these limits. Squeezing and single-photon counting
can enhance searches for the axion-photon interaction. Optimization of quantum spin ensemble
properties is needed to realize the full potential of spin-based searches for the electric-dipole-moment
and the gradient interactions of axion dark matter. Several metrological and sensing techniques,
developed in the ﬁeld of quantum information science, are ﬁnding natural applications in this area
of experimental fundamental physics.
I. DARK MATTER - THE SIGNATURE OF
PHYSICS BEYOND THE STANDARD MODEL
Only six parameters are needed to ﬁt all experimen-
tal data gathered on the behavior of our universe at
cosmological scales [1]. The resulting ΛCDM model
(Lambda cold dark matter) is rich, yet strange. It as-
sumes that general relativity and the Standard Model
of particle physics describe the basic physics of the uni-
verse throughout its history. Yet, at present time, only
≈5%of the universe’s energy density is in the form of
nucleons, electrons, photons, or neutrinos – the particles
that are described by the standard model [2]. Most of
the energy in the universe appears to be in the form of
dark energy that drives the accelerating expansion of the
universe. The best-studied possibility is that this accel-
eration is due to the Einstein cosmological constant Λ,
equivalent to the vacuum energy of empty space [3, 4].
Most of the matter in the universe is in the form of dark
matter, which is non-baryonic and has feeble interactions
(or none at all) with the standard model particles, aside
from gravity.
The early evidence for dark matter long predates the
ΛCDM model. A detailed account of the long history of
the dark matter concept can be found in Ref. [5]. Today,
evidence for dark matter is based on numerous observa-
tions, including galaxy rotation curves, baryonic acoustic
oscillations, and temperature anisotropies of the cosmic
microwave background [6, 7]. The fact that none of thestandard model particles can explain these observations
is an indication that dark matter represents evidence for
physics beyond the standard model. Since it has only
been observed through its gravitational eﬀects, there is a
wide range of darkmatter candidates, spanning90 orders
of magnitude in mass [8, 9].
The weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is a
well-known candidate that has inspired a large number of
ultra-sensitive experiments of increasing complexity and
scale [10, 11]. To date, there has been no unambiguous
detection, and fundamental backgrounds (neutrino ﬂoor)
will soon start to limit the sensitivity of direct WIMP
searches [2, 12–14]. Additionally, recent experiments at
the LHC, as well as laboratory-scale experiments sen-
sitive to permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) of
atoms and molecules, have placed stringent constraints
on theoretical frameworks, such as supersymmetry, that
support WIMP dark matter [15–18]. Nevertheless, the
WIMP concept can be expanded, and broadly-deﬁned
WIMPs remain viable dark matter candidates [8].
Axions and axion-like particles are in the class of ultra-
light dark matter candidates that has attracted increas-
ing attention in the last decade [19]. Quantum Chromo-
dynamics (QCD) axions are considered to have the best
theoretical motivation, because they solve the strong-CP
problem [20]. This problem is brieﬂy formulated as fol-
lows. Strong interactions, described by QCD, are allowed
to violate the combined charge-conjugation C and spa-arXiv:2304.11797v1  [hep-ph]  24 Apr 20232
tial inversion (parity) P discrete symmetries. Such vio-
lation is quantiﬁed by the θparameter that enters the
QCD Lagrangian, and would give rise, for example, to
a permanent EDM of the neutron [21]. Yet, stringent
experimental limits on the neutron EDM and other CP-
violating strong interactions, indicate that this violation
is a factor≈1010smaller than expected [22, 23]. This
constitutes the strong-CP problem. The Peccei-Quinn
mechanism solves this problem, by introducing a new
scalar ﬁeld that changes the QCD Lagrangian so that
instead ofθbeing a constant, it takes on a dynamical ef-
fective value which is driven to zero due to spontaneous
symmetry breaking [24, 25]. The elementary excitation
of this ﬁeld corresponds to the QCD axion, the pseudo-
Goldstone boson of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry [26, 27].
Since its inception, the axion concept has had a deep
impact on theoretical physics, emerging naturally from
grand uniﬁed theories, models with extra dimensions,
and string theory [28]. A plentitude of light pseu-
doscalar bosons ( axion-like particles, ALPs ) arise readily
in string-theory compactiﬁcations, as a result of symme-
tries broken at large energy scales fa[28–30]. Generic
expectations from string theory predict large values for
fa, up to the grand uniﬁed ( ∼1016GeV) and Planck
(∼1019GeV) scales [29, 31–34].
There are many other dark matter candidates, includ-
ing relaxions and other scalar ﬁelds [35], hidden pho-
tons [36], superﬂuid dark matter [37], Planck-scale dark
matter [38], sterile neutrinos [39], and primordial black
holes [40, 41]. Arguments can be made about the de-
gree of theoretical motivation of each speciﬁc candidate,
but the lack of unambiguous experimental evidence of
non-gravitational dark matter interactions signiﬁes the
importance of keeping the dark matter search as broad
as possible [8, 42, 43].
Dark matter is not the only way to resolve puzzles
in astrophysical observations, such as galactic rotation
curves. Other potential solutions modify the theory of
gravitational interactions and dynamics [44, 45]. How-
ever these modiﬁed gravity theories suﬀer from several
problems, and most scientists in this ﬁeld pursue the cold
dark matter paradigm [46].II. THE ROLE OF QUANTUM SCIENCE IN
FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERY
The idea to try to detect non-gravitational interactions
of dark matter in a laboratory is many decades old [5].
Yet, despite numerous sensitive experimental searches of
increasing complexity and scale, there has been no un-
ambiguous detection. One way to guide our eﬀorts to-
wards a potential discovery is to consider recent tech-
nological advances that may allow experiments to probe
previously unexplored territory. Quantum information
science (QIS) is at the forefront of technological inno-
vation [47]. Originating at the foundations of quantum
mechanics, the ﬁeld of quantum science was stimulated
by its convergence with information science, when it was
realized that quantum mechanical machines can perform
certain information-processing tasks faster than any clas-
sical computer. It is still unknown if and how truly large-
scale quantum machines can be built, beyond the noisy
intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices [48]. But
the concepts and tools of QIS have already inspired a
broad spectrum of novel applications, in the ﬁelds rang-
ing from life sciences to materials science [49, 50]. Quan-
tum metrology and quantum sensing are already making
a signiﬁcant impact on fundamental physics [51].
A. What is “Quantum”?
Do we need to deﬁne what is meant by “quantum”, in
order to consider how quantum science can be used to
search for dark matter? After all, it is the scientiﬁc reach
of a particular technology that ultimately determines its
promise, rather than an arguably arbitrary attribute of
“quantumness” [52]. Is a photomultiplier a quantum sen-
sor? It counts photons, quanta of electromagnetic ﬁeld,
with sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit of a
linear ampliﬁer measuring the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Is
a SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference De-
vice) a quantum sensor? It makes use of the Josephson
eﬀect - the quantum interference of the superconduct-
ing wavefunction, split into two paths, interrupted by
Josephson junctions. And it has the word “quantum”3
in the acronym. Answers to such questions are matters
of perspective, but, inevitably, they do guide the scope
of this Perspective. However, it is important to keep in
mind that the ultimate focus is on the potential sensitiv-
ity improvements, the feasibility, and the scientiﬁc merit
of an approach.
Let us loosely deﬁne the “ﬁrst quantum revolution”,
whichgavebirthto“quantum1.0”technologies, basedon
lasers, semiconductor, and superconductor devices. The
promise of the “second quantum revolution” is the de-
velopment of “quantum 2.0” technologies, with the po-
tential to result in impressive performance leaps. For
example, a number of approaches aim to evade the Stan-
dard Quantum Limit (SQL) of measurement, by making
use of entanglement, squeezing, back-action evasion, or
strong correlations. More broadly, QIS has developed
many ideas for how to optimize preparation, transmis-
sion, control, and measurement of correlated quantum
states in systems such as spin ensembles, atomic interfer-
ometers and clocks, color centers, and superconducting
devices.
B. The pioneering eﬀorts
The search for gravitational waves by the Laser Interfer-
ometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is the
pioneering example of how “quantum 2.0” technologies
can make a direct impact on fundamental physics dis-
coveries. Injection of squeezed light into the interfer-
ometer improves the photon shot-noise limit to the sen-
sitivity of the Advanced LIGO detectors [53]. At fre-
quencies above 50 Hzthe sensitivity improvement is up
to3 dB, which corresponds to a 40−50%increase in
the expected gravitational wave event detection rate [54].
At lower frequencies, sensitivity is degraded by quan-
tum back-action, as radiation pressure induces motion
ofinterferometermirrors. However, frequency-dependent
squeezing can achieve a broadband reduction of quantum
noise [55, 56]. These quantum technologies are crucial to
the scientiﬁc reach of the gravitational wave observing
programs [57]. Indeed there is an intriguing possibility
that merger events observed by terrestrial gravitationalwave detectors are due to primordial black holes, which
could contribute a signiﬁcant fraction, if not the entirety,
of the dark matter abundance [40, 41, 58, 59].
The pioneering eﬀorts of incorporating quantum tech-
nologies into gravitational wave detectors have been a
key inspiration for the rapid growth of research activ-
ity in the ﬁeld of quantum sensing and metrology [51].
There are also numerous potential applications for quan-
tum sensors, in ﬁelds ranging from chemistry and bi-
ology, to medicine and geology [60]. Even within fun-
damental physics, there are many diverse ideas for how
quantum technology can be applied. One example is the
development of high-eﬃciency pattern recognition algo-
rithms, based on quantum annealing, in order to speed
up track reconstruction analysis and jet identiﬁcation in
sub-atomic collider experiments [61–63]. Another area
of opportunity is the application of quantum computa-
tional resources to simulate high-energy quantum ﬁeld
theories [64], perform nuclear structure calculations [65],
and model neutrino-nucleus scattering [66].
This Perspective focuses on a speciﬁc area of intense
search for new fundamental physics: the use of quan-
tum technologies to accelerate direct searches for ultra-
light axion-like dark matter. Many of the ongoing and
proposed experiments in this ﬁeld are approaching, or
have already reached, sensitivity levels where quantum
resourcesareneededtoachievetheirscientiﬁcgoals. This
is also where several of the quantum approaches, having
matured in QIS, can ﬁnd a natural application. Thus
there is both a need and an opportunity to use quan-
tum science and engineering. Notably, there are other
avenues for sensitivity improvements that are also being
pursued, suchasdevelopmentofhigh-magneticﬁeldtech-
nologies [67] and high quality factor resonators [68–71].
III. NON-GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTIONS
OF AXION-LIKE DARK MATTER
TheBigBangcosmologyoftheaxiondependsonwhether
the spontaneous breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symme-
try occurs before, during, or after inﬂation [72–75]. Ax-
ions can be produced in the early universe non-thermally4
via the misalignment mechanism [76–78], and via ther-
mal production through axion couplings to the Standard
Model plasma [79, 80]. The misalignment mechanism
dominates for large values of the Peccei-Quinn symme-
try breaking energy scale, generating a coherent oscil-
lating axion ﬁeld a=a0cos (2πνat). The oscillation
frequency corresponds to the axion Compton frequency
νa=mac2/h, wheremais the axion mass, and his
the Planck constant. The ﬁeld amplitude determines
the stored energy density. If we assume that this ax-
ion ﬁeld is the primary component of dark matter, then
its amplitude on Earth can be calculated from the local
galactic dark matter energy density: m2
aa2
0/2 =ρDM≈
4×10−42GeV4[9, 81]. Kinetic energy of the axion-like
dark matter ﬁeld introduces small corrections to its fre-
quency spectrum. The standard halo model predicts the
spectral shape with linewidth (v2
0/c2)νa≈10−6νa, where
v0≈220 km/sis the circular rotation speed of the Milky
Way galaxy at the Sun’s location [82–84].
Symmetry restricts the interactions that axions and
ALPs can have with the particles of the standard model
(such as electrons, photons and nuclei) [19, 81]. There
are three possible interactions. The deﬁning axion inter-
action that solves the strong-CP problem is the coupling
to the gluon ﬁeld [85]. At low energies this leads to the
nucleon electric dipole moment (EDM) interaction
HEDM =gdaE∗·/σ, (1)
wheregdis the coupling strength, σis nucleon spin, and
E∗is an eﬀective electric ﬁeld [86]. This corresponds
to a parity- and time-reversal-violating nucleon EDM,
given byd=gda. Since the axion ﬁeld oscillates at
the Compton frequency νa, this is not a constant, but
an oscillating EDM. Recalling the strong-CP problem,
we note that this corresponds to an oscillating QCD θ
parameter: θ(t) =a(t)/fa, withgdinversely propor-
tional tofa[81, 87]. The EDM coupling generates axion
mass, and for the QCD axion ma≈Λ2
QCD/fa, where
ΛQCD≈200 MeV is the QCD conﬁnement scale [81, 88].
Axions and ALPs can couple to standard model
fermions, such as nucleons or electrons, via the gradientinteraction with Hamiltonian
Hgr=ggrra·, (2)
whereggris the coupling strength and σis fermion spin.
The ﬁnal interaction is with electromagnetic ﬁelds,
commonly written in terms of the Lagrangian
Laγγ=gaγγaE·B, (3)
wheregaγγis the coupling strength and E, Bare electric
and magnetic ﬁelds.
Generically, axionsandALPscanpossessallthesecou-
plings. Direct experimental searches for dark matter can
be thought of as transducers, whose goal is to detect the
eﬀects of an interaction of a speciﬁc dark matter can-
didate with the experimental apparatus, by converting
them into an electromagnetic signal, that is calibrated to
give some information about this interaction. We con-
sider separately the experiments searching for the elec-
tromagnetic interaction of axion-like dark matter with
FIG. 1. Potential QCD axion dark matter mass range
(bottom scale) and corresponding Compton frequencies
(top scale). The ADMX experiment aims to cover the
mass range between 2.5 - 8.3µeV, and future modiﬁca-
tions will seek to double the upper end to 16.5µeV[89–
91]. This is only a small fraction of the possible mass
range. Approaches based on quantum engineering are
an important part of the eﬀorts to broaden the search.

photons, eq. (3), and interaction of axion-like dark mat-
ter with spins, eqs. (1,2).
The possible mass range of axion-like dark matter
is extremely broad. An approximate estimate of the
mass range where existence of axion-like particles is
theoretically and experimentally allowed is 10−19eVto
10−1eV[2]. Focusing on the QCD axion, this window
narrows somewhat to 10−12eV-10−1eV[19]. Only a
tiny fraction of this window has been explored in labora-
tory experiments. The ADMX experiment has searched
for the electromagnetic interaction of axion dark matter
in the mass range 2.66 - 3.31µeV[89, 90], and there is
a program for extending the upper range to 16.5µeV.
There are many other ideas for how to cover a much
broader swath of axion masses [92]. Approaches based
on quantum engineering are an important part of these
eﬀorts, ﬁg. 1.
IV. QUANTUM-ENHANCED SENSORS OF
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
Searches for the electromagnetic interaction of axion-like
dark matter are based on the coupling between the dark
matter ﬁeld and an electromagnetic ﬁeld sensor, such as
a microwave cavity, an optical resonator, or a lumped-
element circuit coupled to a sensitive detector [93]. This
coupling takes place via the interaction in eq. (3). Mi-
crowave cavity-based haloscopes search for conversion of
the axion-like dark matter ﬁeld into photons within a
high quality-factor resonant cavity, placed inside a strong
magnetic ﬁeld, ﬁg. 2. The ADMX experiment is the
most mature search of this type. It has achieved a level
of sensitivity suﬃcient to search for dark matter axions
with masses between 2.66 and 3.31µeVand, under the
assumption that all of dark matter is in the QCD ax-
ion ﬁeld, excluded the QCD axion-photon couplings pre-
dicted by plausible models for this mass range [89, 90].
A number of cavity-based axion dark matter searches are
in development or already exploring ALP masses up to
≈50µeV [23, 94–102]. In order to search for lower-mass
axions and ALPs coupled to photons, it is possible to
use lumped-element circuits [103–110]. This concept is
FIG. 2.Conceptual schematic of the ADMX haloscope.
A resonant cavity is placed in a strong magnetic ﬁeld
created by a superconducting magnet inside a dilution
refrigerator. Dark matter axions are converted to pho-
tons via the electromagnetic interaction in eq. (3). The
resulting electromagnetic signal occupies a narrow band
near the axion Compton frequency νa. It is coupled out
of the cavity and into a sensitive ampliﬁer and detec-
tion chain. The search for the unknown axion mass is
performed by tuning the cavity resonance.
based on a modiﬁcation of Maxwell’s equations by the
gaγγaE·Binteraction: in the presence of a large static
magnetic ﬁeld B0, axion-like dark matter acts as a source
of an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld whose amplitude is pro-
portional to B0[93, 111].
A. Electromagnetic squeezing
For a microwave cavity haloscope, the estimate for the
axion-induced power that has to be detected at the
Compton frequency is ≈10−24W[112]. Experiments
have to be designed to operate at ultra-cold tempera-
tures, to minimize the impact of thermal noise. Zero-
point quantum ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
are a fundamental source of noise at the level of hν/2,
wherehis Planck’s constant and νis the frequency
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld mode. This noise limits
the reach of microwave cavity haloscopes at frequen-6
FIG. 3. (a) Conceptual schematic of the HAYSTAC haloscope. The detection scheme is similar to the ADMX,
consisting of a resonant cavity in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. HAYSTAC operates at microwave frequencies, where zero-
point quantum ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld are the dominant noise source. (b) Frequency-dependence
of Johnson-Nyquist noise originating in the cavity ( N1) and reﬂected from the cavity ( N2), plotted as a function of
detuning from cavity resonance. Noise spectral density is in units of single-quadrature vacuum noise hνc/4, whereνc
is the cavity frequency. The grey band indicate the range of frequencies where internal cavity noise dominates. (c) By
squeezing one of the quadratures of the vacuum state incident on the cavity, HAYSTAC is able to reduce the reﬂected
noise and overcouple the cavity, which broadens the frequency band over which internal cavity noise dominates (grey
region; note that the x-axis spans the same scale as in panel (b)). This increases the sensitive bandwidth at each
cavity tuning step, and therefore speeds up the axion search.
cies above a few GHz. Vacuum squeezing can circum-
vent this limit, and speed up the frequency sweep rate
of a resonant search [113]. This has been implemented
by the HAYSTAC collaboration, which demonstrated a
doubling of their search rate [94, 100]. The HAYSTAC
approach can be understood using a noise model with
two main contributions: N1andN2.N1is the noise
sourced by the internal cavity loss, as a consequence of
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. Its spectral shape is
Lorentzian, with spectral width determined by the cavity
quality factor. N2is the noise incident on, and reﬂected
from, the cavity. This is the Johnson-Nyquist noise, orig-
inating from a 50 Ωtermination, held at cryostat base
temperature, ﬁg. 3 (a) [114]. In the limit where these two
contributions dominate over the noise of the subsequent
ampliﬁer chain, the width of the band of potential axion
masses that are simultaneously probed for a given cavity-
tuning step is determined by the range of frequencieswhereN1dominates over N2, ﬁg. 3 (b). In HAYSTAC
the cavity output port is coupled to two Josephson Para-
metric Ampliﬁers (JPAs) via a non-reciprocal element
(circulator). The noise N2is coupled into the cavity via
one of the circulator ports. The ﬁrst JPA (labeled ‘sq’)
squeezes one of the quadratures of this vacuum state be-
fore it enters the cavity, where it can be displaced by the
interaction with the axion dark matter ﬁeld. The second
JPA (labeled ‘amp’) unsqueezes the state after it exits
the cavity, amplifying the previously-squeezed quadra-
ture. Squeezing does not aﬀect the ratio of the axion-
induced signal Sto the intrinsic cavity noise N1, which
dominates near the cavity resonance. But it does reduce
the contribution from the noise N2, which makes it bene-
ﬁcial to overcouple the cavity and broaden the frequency
bandoverwhich N1dominatesover N2, andthereforethe
band of potential axion masses that are simultaneously
probed for a given cavity-tuning step, ﬁg. 3 (c). This7
allows larger tuning steps, and speeds up the search at
a given axion coupling sensitivity [113]. The HAYSTAC
collaboration search for the electromagnetic interaction
of axion dark matter placed stringent limits on axions
with mass near 17µeV[100].
A closely-related method that has been proposed to
speed up an axion search scan is to couple the axion-
sensitive cavity to an auxiliary resonant circuit via two-
mode squeezing and state-swapping interactions [115].
We should note that both this approach and single-mode
squeezing can enhance the scan rate at lower frequencies,
where the axion-sensitive cavity has appreciable thermal
photon population [113, 116]. Thus they are promising
experimental directions in this regime. At higher fre-
quencies, however, the technique of photon counting can
completely evade the standard quantum limit applicable
to linear measurements of electromagnetic ﬁelds.
B. Photon counting
Photon counting surpasses the standard quantum limit
by measuring only the amplitude and not the phase
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. For cavity-based experi-
ments searching for the electromagnetic interaction of
axion dark matter this means replacing the linear am-
pliﬁer and detection chain in ﬁg. 2 with a photon de-
tector. The detector dark count rate becomes the key
ﬁgure of merit, as the Poisson ﬂuctuations in the back-
ground count rate limit the experimental sensitivity.
At optical and infra-red frequencies photo-multipliers,
avalanche photodiodes, and superconducting nanowire
single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are well-established
technologies [117, 118]. For example, SNSPDs have re-
cently been used to place limits on dark photon dark
matter in the electron-volt mass range [119]. However
such sensors are not suited to detecting lower-energy mi-
crowave quanta.
One possibility for detecting microwave photons is to
use highly-excited Rydberg states in alkali atoms [120,
121]. This approach has recently seen renewed inter-
est [122]. Another approach, spurred by advances in su-
perconducting device technology, has led to the develop-mentofsinglemicrowavephotondetectorsinwhichinput
photons are coupled to a superconducting qubit, whose
stateismeasuredtodetect, andevencount, theincoming
photons [123–125]. Such devices have already found ap-
plications for magnetic resonance spectroscopy of small
ensembles of electron spins [126]. Using microwave pho-
ton counting for an ultralight dark matter search was ex-
ploredinrecentwork, thatimplementedquantumnonde-
molition measurements of cavity photons [127]. A cavity
photon shifts the transition frequency of the transmon
qubit due to the qubit-cavity interaction. The Ramsey
protocol is repeatedly applied to the qubit, performing
a quantum non-demolition cavity photon number parity
measurement [51, 124]. The resulting detection eﬃciency
is≈41%, and the false positive probability, proportional
to the dark count rate is ≈4×10−4[127]. This detector
was used in a proof-of-principle search, which set limits
on the kinetic mixing parameter of hidden photon dark
matter with mass near 25µeV[127]. However, no axion
limits were set, because searching for axion dark mat-
ter requires the presence of strong magnetic ﬁeld, which
would interfere with detector operation. A possible way
forwardistoseparatetheaxion-sensitivecavity, placedin
a strong magnetic ﬁeld, from the detector readout cavity.
Achieving this while maintaining low dark current rate
and high detection eﬃciency is the formidable technical
challenge that remains to be overcome [128].
The squeezing and the microwave photon counting are
complementary approaches. Squeezing should be de-
ployed at low frequencies (axion masses), where it can
accelerate an axion search even in presence of thermal
photons, which would be a deleterious background for
a photon counting device. At high frequencies photon
counting is more eﬀective. It eliminates noise due to vac-
uum ﬂuctuations, since no real photons are generated
by vacuum. Photon counting is also more robust than
squeezing against loss, because vacuum ﬂuctuations in
lossy components add elecromagnetic ﬁeld noise, but do
not generate real photons. The crossover frequency de-
pends on the technical of each approach, but can be es-
timated to be≈10 GHz[112]. Both the squeezing the
photon counting approaches need to solve the technical8
challenges that arise from fundamental incompatibility
of superconducting quantum devices with high magnetic
ﬁelds.
C. Radiofrequency quantum sensors and atomic
systems
In the lower mass range, at radio-frequencies, thermal
noise dominates over zero-point quantum ﬂuctuations.
The cross-over is set by the typical dilution refriger-
ator experiment temperature ≈100 mK, which corre-
sponds to 2 GHz. Nevertheless, the experimental sen-
sitivity of lumped-element resonant axion dark matter
searches beneﬁts from low readout ampliﬁer noise, all
the way down to the standard quantum limit [129]. The
reason for this can be understood with the argument sim-
ilar to the description of the HAYSTAC squeezing ap-
proach. Lower readout ampliﬁer noise does not change
the on-resonance ratio of a potential axion signal to the
thermal noise, but it does increase the sensitivity band-
width over which thermal noise dominates over readout
noise, and therefore speeds up the axion search frequency
scan [116]. SQUIDs have been used as readout ampli-
ﬁers in several lumped-element axion-like dark matter
searches [107, 109, 110], and they can be optimized to
achieve near-quantum-limited performance [130]. The
DM Radio collaboration is developing a Radiofrequency
Quantum Upconverter (RQU) device, with tunable noise
impedance, and compatibility with high-quality-factor
operation of the LC-resonator that couples to axion dark
matter [104, 116]. The ultimate goal is not only to
achieve the standard quantum limit on ampliﬁcation, but
to develop an approach that goes beyond this limit, mak-
ing use of backaction evasion to increase the sensitivity
bandwidth.
Atomic systems provide an alternative approach to
quantum sensing of electromagnetic ﬁelds. As mentioned
previously, Rydberg atoms are sensitive detectors of mi-
crowave electric ﬁelds [131, 132]. A number of experi-
ments have explored entanglement and squeezing in or-
der to make optimal use of quantum resources [133].
One of the applications most relevant for dark mattersearches is sensing of radiofrequency electric ﬁelds, which
can be sourced by hidden photons or the axion-photon
interaction. A recent experiment has demonstrated
240 nV m−1/√
Hzsensitivity, using a two-dimensional
trapped-ion crystal with ≈150ions [134]. The device
measures the center-of-mass motion of the trapped ion
crystal, probed via the collective electronic spin of the
9Be+ions. Entanglement between these two degrees of
freedom allows measurements that evade quantum back-
action and thermal noise, achieving electric ﬁeld sensi-
tivity≈4 dBbelow the standard quantum limit. The
demonstrated sensitivity compares favorably to Rydberg
atom electrometers. Another favorable feature of the
trapped ion technology for an axion dark matter search is
the inherent presence of the strong magnetic ﬁeld, that is
necessary to convert axion dark matter into electromag-
netic ﬁeld. This is in contrast to superconducting detec-
tor technologies, which must be operated near zero mag-
netic ﬁeld. The most signiﬁcant limitation of the trapped
ion approach would be the disadvantage of detecting os-
cillating electric ﬁeld, compared to magnetic ﬁeld, by the
suppressionfactorthatscalesastheratioofexperimental
size and the axion Compton wavelength. Nevertheless, if
the trapped-ion platform can be scaled up, it has the
potential to be competitive with existing limits on the
electromagnetic interaction of axion-like dark matter in
the neV range.
V. SPIN SENSORS
Historically, experiments sensitive to axion-photon inter-
action have dominated searches for ultra-light axion-like
dark matter. However, as noted in section III, there are
two other non-gravitational interactions, which can be
used to detect axion dark matter. These interactions

trons, nucleons, or nuclei. Quantum engineering of spin
systems has been an active research direction in the ﬁeld
of quantum science, so it is natural to ask how these tools
can aid the search for these interactions.
Both of the interactions in eqs. (1,2) can be written in
the following way:9
Hσ=~γB∗·, (4)
whereγis the gyromagnetic ratio and B∗is an os-
cillating pseudo-magnetic ﬁeld that exerts a torque on
spin. Note that this pseudo-magnetic ﬁeld does not
obey Maxwell’s equations; it is sourced by the axion
dark matter ﬁeld. In the case of the gradient interac-
tionB∗
gr=ggrra/(~γ), and in the case of the EDM
interactionB∗
EDM =gdaE∗/(~γσ)[135]. In both cases
B∗oscillates at the Compton frequency νaof the ax-
ion ﬁeld. The objective of experiments that search for
these interactions is to detect the eﬀect of this oscillat-
ing pseudo-magnetic ﬁeld on the evolution of the spin
ensemble under study.
There are two approaches: detecting the energy de-
posited by the dark matter ﬁeld via spin ﬂips, and de-
tecting coherent evolution or energy shift of spins as a
result of the eﬀective interaction in eq. (4). The QUAX
experiment takes the former approach, measuring the en-
ergy deposited by electron spin ﬂips in permeable mate-
rial yittrium iron garnet (YIG) inside a microwave cav-
ity [136–138]. There are related experiments and pro-
posals, making use of interaction with magnons and with
atomic electrons in rare earths [139–141]. The coher-
ent approach is typically used to search for lower ax-
ion masses, in experiments that use nuclear spins. The
Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiments (CASPEr)
use nuclear magnetic resonance to search for the EDM
and the gradient interactions of axion-like dark matter
with nuclear spin ensembles [86, 142–147]. The closely-
related co-magnetometer experiments search for the gra-
dient interaction with nuclear spins [148–150]. Stringent
limits on interaction (4) at low axion masses can also
be extracted from analysis of static EDM experimental
data [151, 152].
Most of the existing spin-based experimental ap-
proaches can be thought of as extensions of an experi-
mental scheme that searches for the axion electromag-
netic coupling, but with a spin ensemble acting as the
transducer between the axions and the electromagnetic
detector. For instance, the QUAX experimental schemeis similar to a microwave cavity axion search shown in
ﬁg. 2, with a YIG spin sample placed inside the cav-
ity [138]. The CASPEr experimental scheme is similar
to a lumped-element circuit search at radio-frequencies,
with a nuclear spin sample acting as the transducer. In
co-magnetometer experiments the role of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld detector is often played by a laser polarimeter.
On the one hand, using spins as transducers increases ex-
perimental complexity, since in addition to all the tech-
nical parameters in an electromagnetic search (such as
sensornoiseandcoupling), oneneedstocalibrateandop-
timize spin ensemble characteristics. On the other hand,
this creates more freedom and opportunity to utilize ma-
terialsandspinensemblecontroltechniquesthatcandra-
matically improve sensitivity.
The interaction Hamiltonian (4) gives rise to a torque
on each spin, whose magnitude is quantiﬁed by the Rabi
frequency Ωa=γB∗/2. In a resonant coherent detec-
tion experiment, the spin ensemble is placed in an ex-
ternal bias magnetic ﬁeld B0. Resonance occurs if the
spin Larmor frequency γB0/(2π)matches the oscillation
frequency of the pseudo-magnetic ﬁeld B∗, which is the
axion Compton frequency νa. If the initial spin orienta-
tion is along the bias magnetic ﬁeld B0, then the torque
tilts them away from this direction. The experimental
observable is the oscillating transverse magnetization
Ma=uM 0ΩaT2cos (2πνat), (5)
whereM0=p~γnis the equilibrium magnetization of
the spin ensemble with polarization fraction pand num-
ber density n,T2is its spin coherence time, and uis a
dimensionless spectral factor that takes into account the
inhomogeneous broadening of the spin ensemble and the
detuning between the axion Compton frequency and the
spin Larmor frequency [147]. One of the ways to mea-
sure the transverse magnetization Ma, is with a pickup
coil that inductively couples the spin ensemble to an elec-
tromagneticsensor, ﬁg.4. Thereareother, morecomplex
detection methods, that make use of atomic magnetome-
ters or co-magnetometers [144 ?, 145].

FIG. 4.Conceptual schematic of the CASPEr search for
the EDM and gradient interactions of axion-like dark
matter. The axion-like dark matter ﬁeld interacts with
the spin ensemble via the oscillating eﬀective magnetic
ﬁeldB∗. Experiments search for the resulting tilt and
precession of the spin ensemble magnetization M, when
the spin Larmor frequency is on resonance with the ax-
ion Compton frequency νa. The search for the unknown
axion mass is performed by varying the leading ﬁeld B0,
which tunes the spin Larmor frequency.
the scheme described above. There is still the standard
quantum limit on the sensitivity of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld sensor that measures the spin magnetization Ma.
This SQL, and the approaches that can circumvent it,
hasbeendiscussedinsectionIVinthecontextofsearches
for the axion-photon coupling. In addition, there is now
another standard quantum limit – in the context of spins
this is called spin-projection noise (SPN) [153]. A sim-
ple way to understand SPN is to consider the following
thought experiment. Suppose a single spin-1/2 is pre-
pared in the “spin-up” state, namely the quantum state
with thesz= 1/2spin projection along the z axis. Then
a measurement of the syspin component is performed.
There are two possible outcomes: sy= +1/2,−1/2, and
they are equally likely. If this sequence is repeated N
times, or the experiment is performed on Nuncorrelated
spins, then the (random) mean value of the syspin com-
ponent is normally distributed, with mean 0 and stan-
dard deviation√
N/2. The uncertainty in the trans-
verse spin projection corresponds to a δθ≈1/√
Nun-
certainty in the polar angle of the spin, or the spin en-
semble. In a spin ensemble with number density n, there
areN=nVspins in volume V, and the SPN magneti-
zation is given by MSPN≈(~γ/V)√
N=~γ/radicalbig
n/V. As
a benchmark, for proton nuclear spins in V= 1 cm3ofwater,µ0MSPN≈10 fT.
The existence of SPN has been noted by Bloch in 1946,
and it has been measured in macroscopic spin ensembles
in a number of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) ex-
periments [154–156]. For spin-based axion dark matter
searches, conversion of SPN limits to the relevant cou-
pling strength, ggrorgd, is analyzed in ref. [157]. Some
of the existing experimental eﬀorts are now approach-
ing SPN-limited sensitivity [147, 149]. Technical chal-
lenges that have to be overcome include the necessity of
a low magnetic ﬁeld noise environment, the requirement
ofprobingabroadrangeofLarmorfrequenciesand,when
searching for the EDM interaction, the need to work with
staticsolidcrystals[147]. Theseareunusualregimesfrom
the point of view of NMR spectroscopy, where experi-
ments are usually done at a ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld, and
solid-state NMR is usually done with magic-angle spin-
ning [158, 159]. Nevertheless, spin-based axion dark mat-
ter searches are likely to reach SPN-limited sensitivity in
the next few years [157]. Accomplishing this will require
quantum engineering of the spin ensemble properties, in-
cluding polarization and coherence time, as well as opti-
mization of the electromagnetic sensors that are used for
ensemble evolution readout. For example, the problem
of readout back-action on the spin ensemble (somewhat
misleadingly called “radiation damping” in NMR spec-
troscopy) will have to be addressed, especially for gra-
dient interaction searches [157]. Spin-based experiments
are likely to beneﬁt from some of the accomplishments
described in section IV. For instance, superconducting
microwave photon detectors have already been used for
magnetic resonance spectroscopy of small ensembles of
electron spins [126]. In the near future, the RQU de-
vices, with their tunable noise impedance and potential
SQL-limited sensitivity, will play an important role in
optimized spin ensemble readout at radio-frequencies.
Is it possible to use quantum engineering to go beyond
the SPN? This question has inspired intense research, in-
cluding ideas such as spin squeezing, entangled states,
and quantum error correction [133, 160, 161]. There are
also long-standing arguments that assert that many of
these approaches can not make signiﬁcant improvements11
to the signal-to-noise ratio of an optimized experiment
with SPN-limited sensitivity [162, 163]. However, even
if this is true, there may be other ways to engineer spin
ensembles in order to improve such experiments. For ex-
ample, in sec. IV we described how squeezing can achieve
an improvement in the useful bandwidth of a search for
axion-like dark matter, and therefore speed up the search
over the axion Compton frequencies. Speciﬁc spin en-
semble quantum engineering schemes will be explored in
the next 3-5 years. Maximizing sensitivity to small back-
ground ﬁelds necessitates the use of macroscopic spin en-
sembles, on the order of one mole, which leads to un-
precedented technical challenges (listed in the previous
paragraph), compared to much smaller-scale demonstra-
tion experiments. Nevertheless, there are grounds for
signiﬁcant optimism, given the ﬂexibility that is created
by choosing the spin ensemble with optimal properties,
such as coherence, and combining it with state-of-the-art
precision sensors and metrology techniques. If funda-
mental sensitivity limits, imposed by thermal and quan-
tum noise, can be reached, we are likely to see important
scientiﬁc breakthroughs in spin-based axion dark matter
searches within the next 5-10 years.
VI. OUTLOOK
The dark matter puzzle is one of the most compelling
leads in our search for physics beyond the standard
model. After decades of searching for the WIMP, there
is a rapidly growing recognition that experimental eﬀorts
should be broadened, and the QCD axion is a very well-
motivated target. The nature of experimental searches
for axion-like dark matter oﬀers clear opportunities for
the powerful toolbox of quantum science to expand thescientiﬁc reach of these searches. Some of these oppor-
tunities are sketched in ﬁg. 1. The ADMX haloscope is
searching for the QCD axion, and is projected to cover
the 2.5 - 8.3µeVmass range by 2025. Quantum tech-
nologies create opportunities to expand the search range
by orders of magnitude, potentially 1 peVto1 meV. The
approaches covered in this perspective include quantum
spin ensembles, whose optimal sensitivity is at lower ax-
ion masses, radiofrequency quantum sensors, electromag-
netic cavity squeezing and entanglement, and microwave
photon counting using qubits. Whether or not one of
these searches discovers the axion depends, of course, on
its unknown mass and interactions. Perhaps unexpected
discoveries will be made. Quantum science is letting us
lookinplaceswherenoonehaseverlookedbefore. What-
ever the outcome of the search for axion-like dark matter,
there is no doubt that development of quantum precision
measurement methods will lead to new devices, sensors,
and technologies, which may ﬁnd diverse applications in
fundamental and applied science. After all, quantum en-
gineering is already a key driving force behind innova-
tion and scientiﬁc progress in disciplines ranging from
computer science to systems engineering and the life sci-
ences.
