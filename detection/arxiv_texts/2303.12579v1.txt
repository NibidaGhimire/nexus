ABSTRACT
Core-collapse supernova remnants are structures of the interstellar medium (ISM) left behind the explosive death of most
massive stars ( .40 M). Since they result in the expansion of the supernova shock wave into the gaseous environment shaped
by the star’s wind history, their morphology constitutes an insight into the past evolution of their progenitor star. Particularly,
fast-moving massive stars can produce asymmetric core-collapse supernova remnants. We investigate the mixing of materials
in core-collapse supernova remnants generated by a moving massive 35 Mstar, in a magnetised ISM. Stellar rotation and the
windmagneticﬁeldaretime-dependentlyincludedintothemodelswhichfollowtheentireevolutionofthestellarsurroundings
from the zero-age main-sequence to 80 kyrafter the supernova explosion. It is found that very little main-sequence material is
present in remnants from moving stars, that the Wolf-Rayet wind mixes very eﬃciently within the 10 kyrafter the explosion,
while the red supergiant material is still unmixed by 30%within 50 kyrafter the supernova. Our results indicate that the faster
the stellar motion, the more complex the internal organisation of the supernova remnant and the more eﬀective the mixing of
ejecta therein. In contrast, the mixing of stellar wind material is only weakly aﬀected by progenitor motion, if at all.
Key words: MHD – stars: evolution – stars: massive – ISM: supernova remnants.
1 INTRODUCTION
High-mass stars are deﬁned as stellar objects of mass 𝑀★heavier
than 8 M(Salpeter 1955; Kroupa 2001), and they represent 1%
ofallstarsintheMilkyWay.Theyformindenseandhighlyopaque
giant molecular clouds, as a result of the local free-fall gravitational
collapseofdensecoldgas(Shu1992).Theyfollowaformationsce-
nariothatisascaled-upversionofthatoflow-massstars(Vorobyov
& Basu 2006; Vorobyov 2009, 2010), and which is well-described
by the so-called burst mode of accretion in star formation (Meyer
et al. 2017, 2021a). When the infalling molecular material lands
onto a centrifugally-balanced accretion disc, it undergoes gravita-
tional instability and gaseous clumps can form and inward-migrate
onto stellar surface, adding mass to the young massive star (Meyer
et al. 2019). Once massive protostars are hot enough, their ionizing
feedbackdissipatetheirsurroundingmolecularenvironmentandthey
release strong supersonic winds from the stellar surface (Vink et al.
2000)tointeractdirectlywiththeinterstellarmedium(ISM),giving
birth to stellar wind bubbles (Weaver et al. 1977).
As a function of multiplicity (Sana et al. 2012), metallicity (Brott
et al. 2011a,b) and rotation properties (Maeder & Meynet 2000;
Szécsi et al. 2022), massive stars evolve from a long initial main-
sequence phase by undergoing several evolutionary phases, char-
acterised by abrupt surface properties changes, alternating be-
tween hot, fast-winded with cold, slow-winded phases (Langer
2012).Althoughexoticevolutionaryphasesexist(Smith2014;Groh
★E-mail: dmameyer.astro@gmail.comet al. 2014), a high-mass star typically goes through a red super-
giant phase (Levesque 2010; Davies 2017), followed, in the case
𝑀★>30 M, by a Wolf-Rayet phase (Underhill 1968; Hamann
1992;Crowther2007),beforeexplodingasasupernova(Woosley&
Weaver 1986; Weiler & Sramek 1988; Smartt 2009). The circum-
stellar medium of massive stars is the region of the ISM directly
surrounding high-mass stellar objects and it adopts morphologies
and emission properties reﬂecting both the stellar feedback and the
ambient medium properties.
The surroundings of young massive stellar objects are massive
accretion discs of radius 1000 au(Johnston et al. 2015; Ilee et al.
2016;Ahmadietal.2018)thatareevaporatedandblownbytheradi-
ation ﬁeld and the wind of zero-age main-sequence high-mass stars.

larwindbubbledescribedinWeaveretal.(1977),whichisdistorted

et al. 2016, 2017) to the high-energies (Benaglia et al. 2010; del
Valle et al. 2013; De Becker et al. 2017). When the star evolves to
the red supergiant phase, the wind interacts either with the interior
of the main-sequence wind bubble (Garcia-Segura et al. 1996b,a;
Freyer et al. 2006), or directly with the ISM if the star moves fast
enough(Brighenti&D’Ercole1995b;Chitaetal.2008;Herbstetal.

the ﬁngerprint of its past life onto the ISM, and, it constitutes the
location of the supernova explosion. The supernova remnants left
behind the death of high-mass stars are shaped by the interaction of
thesupernovashockwavewiththecircumstellarmedium(Weiler&
Sramek 1988). Unfolding them permit to reconstruct the past evolu-
tion and to constrain the properties of its progenitor star.
Supernova remnants of massive progenitor stars, or core-collapse
supernova remnants, are characterised by the presence of circum-
stellar material enriched in the heavy elements synthetised by the
progenitor released as stellar winds. They reveal the presence of el-
ements such as Fe (Uchida et al. 2009), that have been produced in
the core of the progenitor and by the possible presence of a neutron
star left inside of the supernova remnant (Zavlin et al. 1998; Gvara-
madze 2006), ultimately leading to the formation of pulsar wind
nebulae(Olmi&Bucciantini2023,2019).Thesupernovaexplosion
is closely connected to non-thermal physical mechanisms such as
the anisotropic liberation of neutrinos (Kifonidis et al. 2006; Müller
etal.2012;Müller&Janka2015)andtheproductionofgravitational
waves (Jardine et al. 2022). Models from the early instants (Aloy &
Obergaulinger 2021) up to the ﬁrst year of core-collapse event has
been subject to numerical modelling in Gabler et al. (2021). The
interaction of the liberated supernova shock wave with the last wind
of the progenitor generates characteristic lightcurve functions of the
windproperties,whichhavebeenobservedandmodelled(Chevalier
1982;Chevalier&Liang1989;Truelove&McKee1999).Theprop-
agating shock wave interacts with the circumstellar material before
further expanding into the interstellar medium (Tutone et al. 2020),
leading to the production of non-thermal emission (Orlando et al.
2019;Dasetal.2022).Awell-documentedexampleofsuchmecha-
nismisthatofCassiopeiaA(Finnetal.2016;Holland-Ashfordetal.
2020).
Once the shock wave further expands, its propagation is con-
strained by the distribution of circumstellar material shaped by the
supernovaprogenitor,seee.g.thecaseofthehistoricalcore-collapse
supernova remnant Kes 73 (Katsuda et al. 2018). The reﬂection to-
wards the center of the explosion of the shock wave against its own
circumstellar matter produces a central region emitting thermal X-
rays that is surrounded by a radio shell. This class of supernova
remnants is called mixed-morphology supernova remnant (Yusef-
Zadeh et al. 2003; Arias et al. 2019; Chiotellis et al. 2019; Derlopa
etal.2019).Mostevolvedsupernovaremnantsexhibitmorphologies
deviating from sphericity. These asymmetries might have many ori-
gins,suchastheintrinsicasymmetryoftheexplosion(Orlandoetal.
2020), but also the aspherical distribution of circumstellar material
like an asymmetric (Blondin et al. 1996) wind or a bow shocks gen-
erated by runaway massive stars. The organised magnetic ﬁeld of
the ISM imposes stellar wind bubbles of massive stars an elongated
morphology(vanMarleetal.2015),which,initsturn,imposesrect-
angularshapestothesupernovaremnants(Meyeretal.2022).Onthe
long term, they can reﬂect in the subsequent pulsar wind nebulae of
plerioniccore-collapsesupernovaremnants(Meyer&Meliani2022;
Bandiera et al. 2023).
In this study, we explore by means of 2.5D MHD simulations
themorphologyandemissionpropertiesofcore-collapsesupernova
remnants generated by runaway massive stars, including the rota-
tion and magnetisation of the stellar winds. Furthermore, our ap-
proach made of high-resolution simulations using a uniform cylin-
drical grid (Meyer et al. 2015, 2020a, 2021b) is updated with theinclusion of a system of passive scalar tracers which permit us to
time-dependentlyfollowthematerialssuccessfullyexpelledfromthe
stellar surface throughout the many evolutionary phases undergone
by the high-mass star. The circumstellar medium of the supernova
progenitor isﬁrst simulated fromthe zero-age main-sequenceof the
star until the supernova time using methods similar to that of Com-
erón & Kaper (1998); van Marle et al. (2005, 2007, 2011); Mackey
etal.(2012);vanMarleetal.(2014);Meyeretal.(2014,2016,2017,
2020b); Green et al. (2019). Then, the early supernova-wind inter-
action is calculated in a one-dimensional fashion (Chevalier 1982;
Truelove&McKee1999;Dwarkadas2005,2007;Whalenetal.2008;
van Marle et al. 2010; Telezhinsky et al. 2012a,b, 2013; Chiotellis

(1990,1991);Velázquezetal.(2006);vanVeelenetal.(2009);Vigh
et al. (2011); Chiotellis et al. (2012); Toledo-Roy et al. (2014); van
Marleetal.(2015);Fangetal.(2017);Chiotellisetal.(2020,2021).
By performing a resolution study, we discuss the internal organisa-
tion of the supernova remnants, such as the mixing of material at
work therein, and, by radiative transfer calculation, we predict their
non-thermal appearance by synchrotron emission.
This paper is organised as follows. First, the numerical methods
usedtomodelmagnetisedcore-collapsesupernovaremnantsofrun-
away, rotating, magnetised Wolf-Rayet-evolving massive stars are
presented in Section 2. We detail the internal properties of the su-
pernova remnants of a runaway 35 Mprogenitor in Section 3. We
further discuss our results in Section 4 and ﬁnally draw our conclu-
sions in Section 5.

In this section we present the methods used to simulate the core-
collapse supernova remnants of a runaway rotating magnetised
35 Mmassive star.

et al. 2007, 2012; Vaidya et al. 2018) using a Godunov-type solver
composed of the shock-capturing HLL Rieman solver (Harten et al.
1983) and the eight-wave ﬁnite-volume algorithm (Powell 1997) for

medium of evolving and dying massive stars (Meyer et al. 2021c).
Furthermore, the numerical scheme uses a third-order Runge-Kutta
time integrator, the minmod ﬂux limiter and the WENO3 interpola-
tion scheme for the reconstruction of the primitive variables of the
system. The time-marching algorithm is controlled by the Courant-
Friedrich-Levy rule that is initialised to 𝐶cﬂ=01(Meyer 2021).

cylindrical coordinate system (R,z) and a »0; 100¼»  50; 50¼pc2
computational domain of 80008000grid zones. The stellar wind
of the massive star is injected at the surface of a sphere of radius

to be the proﬁle

where¤𝑀is the mass-loss rate of the massive star, 𝑣wthe terminal
wind velocity of the star and 𝑟the radial direction. As in the previ-
ous papers of this series, the stellar wind nebula developing around
the star is calculated in its reference frame. The stellar motion is
mimiced by imposing a gas ﬂow 𝑣= 𝑣★at the outer boundary of
the computational domain at 𝑧=50 pc, with𝑣★=20 pcthe stellar
speed through the ISM, see also Comerón & Kaper (1998); Green
et al. (2019); Meyer et al. (2020b). The uniform ambient medium is

and a magnetisation of 𝐵ISM=7𝜇Gtaken to be parallel to the 𝑂𝑧
symmetry axis of the computational domain (Meyer et al. 2017).

the stellar evolution model of the /g.pc/e.pc/n.pc/e.pc/v.pc/a.pclibrary2(Ekström et al.

The time-dependence of the stellar surface magnetic ﬁeld 𝐵★¹𝑡º
is estimated by assuming a typical ﬁeld strength for each individual
evolutionary phase of the massive star. The main-sequence ﬁeld is
takento𝐵★=500 G(Fossatietal.2015;Castroetal.2015;Przybilla

etal.2002,2005;Kervellaetal.2018).Finally,weassumethead-hoc
value of𝐵★=100 Gfor the ﬁnal Wolf-Rayet phase (Meyer 2021).
These assumed values are reported in Fig. 2a and permit to build
a magnetic ﬁeld history at any radius of the stellar wind boundary

happening therein.
3.1 The pre-supernova circumstellar medium
Fig. 3 displays circumstellar medium at the supernova time in our
MHD simulations of massive runaway stars moving with velocity
𝑣★=20 km s 1(panel a) and 𝑣★=40 km s 1(panel b). The ﬁgures

where𝜃is the angle from the direction of stellar motion (Wilkin

apex of the bow shock. A series of contours trace the regions made
of50%in number density of each kind of material, such as the
main-sequence stellar wind (blue), the red supergiant (red) and the
Wolf-Rayet (purple) stellar winds as well as the supernova ejecta
(green).
The cone of the bow shock behind the star is more opened in the
caseofthestarmovingwith 𝑣★=20 km s 1(Fig.3a)thaninthecase
ofthefaster-movingstar(Fig.3b).TheWolf-Rayetwind,fasterthanthe speed of stellar motion 𝑣★, forms a shell of evolved stellar wind
and swept-up ISM gas when interacting bow shock (Brighenti &
D’Ercole 1995a,b). The circumstellar medium of the faster-moving
star is aﬀected by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, both ahead of the
bow shock where large eddies are seen, and in the tubular cavity in
the wake of the star, which close it and separate the main-sequence
material from the other winds (Fig. 3b). The environment of the
slower-moving stellar object displays a region of red supergiant ma-
terial(red)separatingthemain-sequencewind(blue)fromtheWolf-
Rayet material (purple). Hence, the mixing of post-main-sequence
materials is also at work before the supernova explosion when the
star moves slowly, because of the size and unstable character of the
low-density channel (Fig. 3a). Conversely, the supernova ejecta of
thefast-movingstararereleasedinaclosedbubbleofradius 10 pc
centered onto the location of the defunct star (Fig. 3a), whereas the
directenvironmentofthesupernovaoftheslowlymovingstarisopen

3.2 Supernova remnants
The next panels of Fig. 3 show the evolution of the supernova rem-
nants at times 8 kyr( middle line) and at time 80 kyrfor the model
with𝑣★=20 km s 1(left) and𝑣★=40 km s 1(right). They plot
the reverberation of the supernova shock wave against the walls of
the asymmetric Wolf-Rayet cavity at work in the remnants, together
with the subsequent game of reﬂections and transmissions of waves
happening in it. The imprint of the morphology of that Wolf-Rayet
cavity already strongly modiﬁes the geometry of the expanding for-
ward shock at time 8 kyr. The ejecta ﬁlled the region between the
center of the explosion and the former termination shock of the pre-
supernovabowshock,andthereverberatedshocktowardsthecenter

to eﬃciently mix with the Wolf-Rayet material (purple) in the di-
rection opposite of that of the progenitor’s motion. Note that the red
supergiant material distributes, because of the morphology of the
instabilities of the pre-supernova circumstellar medium, as knots in
the case of our faster-moving progenitor (Fig. 3d).

seeFig.4a.Thewindcontributionisgovernedbytheredsupergiant
material. Then, the ejecta kinetic energy diminishes because of the
deceleration of the blastwave which enters the Sedov-Taylor phase
once it interacts with the circumstellar medium of the progenitor
and sweeps up more of that material than the mass of the ejecta.
Thesituationissimilarinthemodelwithprogenitor’svelocity 𝑣★=
40 km s 1, although we note an energetically more important main-
sequence wind in the ﬁrst 15 kyrof the remnant’s life (Fig. 4d).
This is due to the thinner, more unstable cavity of unshocked stellar
wind left behind the progenitor in the case of a fast-moving star,
whichpreventstheejectatointeractdirectlywiththemain-sequence
material, see Fig. 3.
The magnetic energy 𝐸magof the gas constituting the supernova
remnant is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the kinetic
energy𝐸kin.Withinthemanymaterialsinsideofthesupernovarem-
nant, the ejecta contributes less than one per cent to 𝐸mag, because
in our models the unshocked supernova material is initially unmag-
netised (Section 2.3). The shocked ejecta compress the stellar wind
andthecircumstellarmagneticﬁeldlines,whichmixwiththeejecta
as the blastwave does through the material of the wind-blown bub-
ble. The contribution from the stellar wind is governed by the red
supergiant material, while the main-sequence gas, and, to an even
largerextendtheWolf-Rayetmaterialarenegligibletothemagnetic
energy(𝐸RSGmag¡𝐸MSmagand𝐸RSGmag¡𝐸WRmag).Thedensersurroundings
generated by the progenitor moving with velocity 𝑣★=40 km s 1
induce a slightly more magnetised remnant (Fig. 4e). The internal
contribution to the total energy of the supernova remnant is very
small(Fig.4c,f).ItisregulatedbytheshockedISMmaterial( 90%),
the red supergiant material weights for 1%of the internal energy
while the other winds (main-sequence and Wolf-Rayet) have negli-
gible contributions to 𝐸int.
3.4 X-rays luminosities
Fig. 5 displays the hard (top) and soft (bottom) X-ray lightcurves
of the supernova remnants of the progenitors moving with velocity
𝑣★=20 km s 1(left) and𝑣★=40 km s 1(right). As in Fig. 4, the
diﬀerent stellar winds, the supernova ejecta, and the ISM material
are separated using the system of passive scalar tracers. For a given
species, the X-ray luminosity at energy 𝐸>𝛼keVis estimated as,

where𝑗Xis the emissivity for diﬀuse ISM obtained with the /x.pc/s.pc/p.pc/e.pc/c.pc

𝑣★=20 km s 1accountsfor10%ofthesoft𝐿X,whiletheISMand
the ejecta represent 40%each. In the model with 𝑣★=40 km s 1,
the wind contribution is more important, especially at the moment
of the reﬂection of the shock wave inside of the remnant, when it
can reach up to40%and exceed that of the ISM plus ejecta (thin
lines of Figs. 5a,b). On the contrary, the total soft X-ray luminosity
increases and reaches a plateau largely governed by the radiation
from ISM material which exceeds the luminosity in hard X rays
by several orders of magnitude. Note that the ejecta contribution
to the soft X-ray luminosity is about 20%as its temperature is too
hot (𝑇>106K) and that the stellar wind contribution is nebligible
once the shock wave has interacted with the circumstellar medium
(at times 5 kyr).

3.5 Mixing of materials in the supernova remnant
Fig.6plotsthevolumeevolutionoftheremnantswhoseprogenitors
are moving with velocity 𝑣★=20 km s 1(top) and𝑣★=40 km s 1
(bottom). Each ﬁgure distinguishes the components from the main-
sequence(dashedblueline),redsupergiant(dotteddashedblueline),
Wolf-Rayet (solid blue line) stellar winds, the supernova ejecta (or-
ange), and the ISM material (dashed dotted black line). Most of the
supernovaremnantsareﬁlledwithshockedISMmaterial(seedashed

of its volume, all the other species representing about 10 20%of
theremainingvolume.Thevolumeoftheremnantisconstantinour

circumstellar medium, which does not evolve much after the time
of the explosion. However, the volume ﬁlled by the ejecta quickly
increases after the explosion during the freely expanding phase of
the blastwave ( 65 kyrafter the explosion) and its proportion of oc-
cupied volume reaches 15%in the model with 𝑣★=20 km s 1
(Fig. 6a) and10%𝑣★=40 km s 1(Fig. 6b) since the cavity of
the slowly-moving progenitor is larger than that of the fast-moving
one(Fig.3).Theotherstellarwindmaterials,whichveryinitiallyﬁll
more space than the ejecta, quickly shrink as the blastwave propa-
gates and mixes with the Wolf-Rayet stellar wind. At time 610 kyr
this induces a transition between the wind material in the remnant
being mostly made of Wolf-Rayet gas to a stage in which the red
supergiant gas dominates.

and where the denominator is the initial mass of that same material,
see Orlando et al. (2005). For 𝑓=0no mixing at all has taken
place inside of the remnant while for 𝑓=1most ejecta material isdispersed into volume elements to which it contributes 50%in
number density.
Atthebeginningofthesimulation,themain-sequencematerialis
already fairly mixed to a fraction >95%, regardless of the motion
of the progenitor star (Fig. 7a). We consider only the circumstellar
medium at distance 50 pcfrom the location of the explosion and
use it to initialise the simulations, which ignores the long trail of
main-sequence material behind the star (Fig.3). Hence, the main-
sequence material in the computational domain only represents that
expelled by the star before the onset of the red supergiant phase.
The mixing factor increases 15 20kyr after the explosion, when
the ejecta, channelled into the low-density cavity, pushes the main-
sequence wind out of the box, and 𝑓MS=1for𝑣★=20 km s 1,
see Fig. 7a. Conversely, the red supergiant material is distributed
between the Wolf-Rayet gas and the main-sequence bow shock, and
it is compressed and mixed as the blastwave propagates. Since the
ring produced by the Wolf-Rayet material is out of its stellar wind
bubble, the space velocity of the progenitor star matters very little,
and the evolution of 𝑓RSGis similar in both cases, see Fig. 7b.

by the bow shock, which permits the shock wave to rapidly undergo

The reason for this is the proximity of the center of the supernova

other kinds of stellar wind being largely melted with each other. At
this time, the supernova ejecta are almost entirely dispersed into the
remnant.

of ejecta does not depend on the progenitor speed since we used the
same explosion properties for both models (Fig. 9 a,c), diﬀerences
beingexclusivelyinthedistributionofthecircumstellarmaterialand
shocked ISM. The stellar wind material (especially red supergiant)
already exhibits a diﬀerent level of mixing because a faster motion
of the star induces more mixing. In the model with 𝑣★=20 km s 1,
thisdichotomyincreasesatlatertimes,whentheredsupergiantma-
terial enters the low-density cavity and the density distribution ofthe stellar wind and the gas distribution splits into two components
(Fig.9b),whereasthedistributionofWolf-Rayetgasappearssimilar

in the density distribution is the manner the main-sequence and red
supergiant gas melt into the supernova remnant with the other kind
of materials, see solid and dotted lined histograms of Fig. 9b,d. The
slightly more peaked distribution of supernova ejecta in the fast-
moving model reﬂects the diﬀerent reverberation properties of the
supernovashockwaveagainstthecircumstellarmedium(Fig.9b,d).

should also be investigated in future studies as this may be a key
factor in the shaping of middle-age supernova remnants (Ferreira &
de Jager 2008; Rathjen et al. 2021). Last, several physical mecha-
nismsmustbeincorporatedintothesimulationsofourstudy,suchas
anisotropic heat conduction (Bedogni & D’Ercole 1988; Velázquez
et al. 2004; Orlando et al. 2005; Vieser & Hensler 2007; Balsara
et al. 2008a,b) or an explicit treatment of the photoionization of the
progenitorstarinordertosimulatethedegreeofionizationofthegas
in the remnant (see e.g. García-Segura et al. 1999; van Marle et al.
2004; Arthur & Hoare 2006; Toalá & Arthur 2011).
4.2 Eﬀects of spatial resolution
Fig. 10 repeats the analysis presented in Fig. 7 by investigating the
eﬀect of spatial resolution on the time evolution of the mixing of
the diﬀerent materials in the supernova remnant models with stellar
velocity𝑣★=20 km s 1. The panels show the mixing eﬃciency in
simulationsperformedwithspatialresolutions 10002000(dashed
redline), 20004000(dotteddashedblueline), 40008000(dashed
dotted orange line) and 800016000(solid black line). The tracers
in the simulation are used to separate the mixing eﬃciency during
theearly 50 kyrafterthesupernovaexplosionforthemain-sequence
(a), red supergiant (b), Wolf-Rayet (c) stellar winds and for the su-
pernova ejecta (d), respectively. No notable diﬀerences in terms of
mixingeﬃciencyofthemain-sequencematerialhappens,especially
becausemostofthiskindofgashasleftthecomputationaldomainat
times>25 kyr. Note that because of the deﬁnition that we adopted,
the mixing factor equals to unity once all the material has left the
computational domain (Fig. 10a). The mixing of the red supergiant
materialisthemostsensitivetospatialresolution.Thevariabilityof
the mixing factor diminishes with the increasing spatial resolution,
and its value is slightly overestimated when the resolution is too
coarse (Fig. 10b). The models show that it has not yet converged,
except at longer times >45 kyr, and that even higher-resolution
simulationsareneededtocarefullytrackthemixingofthedustysu-
pergiantmaterialintosupernovaremnants.Inversely,theWolf-Rayet
gas mixes quickly into the remnants, and has already converged in
ourlow-resolutionmodels(Fig.10c).Theejectamixingbehavesdif-
ferently: the mixing eﬃciency increases by a factor of 2when the
resolutionismultipliedbyafactorof4(Fig.10d).High-resolutionis
therefore a key ingredient of core-collapse supernova mixing mod-
elling (Orlando et al. 2019).

remnant is much older ( 80 kyr), the manner the blastwave reﬂected

thestellarwinds.Massivebowshockshavestoppedtheblastwaveaf-

where the supernova shock wave interacted with the circumstellar

post-main-sequence materials (Fig. 11c). In the other model with
40 km s 1, the red supergiant gas ﬁlls the lower ( 𝑧  0) region of
the supernova remnant, in which clumps of Wolf-Rayet-rich gas are
scattered. This is a major diﬀerence between remnants from slow-
and fast-moving progenitors, which has observable consequences.

ues this numerical eﬀort by exploring the bulk motion of the same
Wolf-Rayet-evolving progenitor. The zero-age main-sequence rota-
tionrateofthemassivestarusedtosimulateoursupernovaremnants
is taken to 10%of its break-up velocity. It is necessary to include
rotation in the simulations otherwise the toroidal component of the
stellar magnetic ﬁeld vanishes and only the insigniﬁcantly weak ra-
dial component will remain. This will let the unshocked supernova

5 CONCLUSION
This paper investigates the evolution of young to middle-age core-
collapsesupernovaremnantsgeneratedbya 35 Mmassiverunaway
star with particular emphasis on the mixing of materials. Our 2.5D
magneto-hydrodynamical numerical simulations account for the ro-
tation (Ekström et al. 2012) and magnetisation (Meyer et al. 2021c;
Baalmann et al. 2020, 2021) of the progenitor star that is mov-
ing through the warm, uniform, magnetised phase of the interstellar
medium of the Milky Way. A system of passive scalar tracers per-
mitsustofollowtheadvectionofthediﬀerentkindofwindmaterials
throughout the pre-supernova evolution of the progenitor. The sim-
ulations are conducted in the fashion of the precedent papers of this
series, by ﬁrst modelling the detailed circumstellar medium of the
progenitor star at the pre-supernova time, and by releasing into it a
separatelycalculatedsolutionfortheejecta-windthatissimulatedup
to100 kyr,see(Meyeretal.2015,2020a,2021b).Thehigh-resolution
calculations are performed using the /p.pc/l.pc/u.pc/t.pc/o.pccode (Mignone et al.
2007, 2012; Vaidya et al. 2018) that has been validated for circum-
stellar medium and supernova remnants studies (Meyer et al. 2014,
2017).
It is found that the manner the stellar winds associated to the
various evolutionary phases of the progenitor, as well as the su-
pernova ejecta, distribute into the supernova remnant diﬀers greatly
depending on the bulk motion of the star, the level of wind mixing
increasingwithit,i.e.faster-movingprogenitorsgenerateolderrem-
nants hosting more complex, dense ﬁlamentary internal patterns of
mixed species, where wind mixes less but ejecta does it better. Very
little main-sequence material ( 65%) is present in the remnants, as
itischannelledintothetubularlow-densitycavityofwindproduced
bytheprogenitor’sstellarmotion.Theredsupergiantmaterialisthe
leastmixedspecies,whiletheWolf-Rayetgaseﬃcientlymixesinthe
early 20 kyrafter the explosion.
Our results show that the spatial distribution of the post-main-
sequence stellar winds depends on the progenitor’s spatial motion.
Atlatertimesafterthesupernovaexplosion( ¡40 kyr),thereﬂection
of the supernova blastwave spreads wind material to the interior of
the remnant nebula, distributing Wolf-Rayet clumps inside of it, if
theprogenitor’smotionisimportant( 𝑣★=40 km s 1).Theenrichedstellar wind material remains in the region of the pre-supernova
circumstellar medium for slower progenitors ( 𝑣★=20 km s 1). In-
terestingly, the mixing eﬃciency of ejecta is less important in the
context of runaway progenitors than in the case of a massive star
(Meyer et al. 2022). The spatial resolution is very important in the
numerical study of mixing processes into core-collapse supernova
remnants, as a low resolution tends to overestimate that of the red
supergiant and Wolf-Rayet stellar winds and underestimates that of
thesupernovaejecta.Indeed,theregionsﬁlledbythewindsturnedto
be isolate islands located around the shell made of the circumstellar
medium shocked by the blastwave, where the material is both sub-
sonicandsuperalfvenic.Suchworkshouldbeextendedtothestellar
clusters made of multiple massive stars (Badmaev et al. 2022).
