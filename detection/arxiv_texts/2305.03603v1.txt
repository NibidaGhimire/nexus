Abstract: Neutron stars are the densest objects in the Universe. They have microscopically homogeneous
core and heterogeneous crust. In particular, there may be a speciﬁc layer inside neutron stars, the mantle,
which consists of substantially non-spherical nuclei immersed in a background of relativistic degenerate
electrons and quasi-free neutrons. In this paper we reconsider transverse shear modulus for cylindrical
phases of the mantle within the framework of compressible liquid drop model. We demonstrate that
transverse shear affects the shape of nuclear clusters: their cross-section becomes elliptical. This effect
reduces respective elastic constant. Using a simple model we perform all derivations analytically and
obtain the expression for the transverse shear modulus, which can be useful for astrophysical applications.
Keywords: neutron stars; dense matter; elastic properties; pasta phase.
1. Introduction
The mantle is a speciﬁc microscopically inhomogeneous layer of neutron star, where
nuclear clusters’s shapes are essentially non-spherical. This layer was predicted for the ﬁrst
time in [ 1,2] by considering a set of symmetrical pasta-like nuclear shapes – cylinders, plates,
and their inverse conﬁgurations – along with spherical nuclei and spherical holes. This set has
become canonical and was considered in a large number of subsequent papers (e.g., [ 3–23]),
while some papers suggested more complex structures on the base of numerical simulations
[24–26]. In this paper we limit ourselves to cylindrical nuclear shapes (both inverse and
normal).
The mantle affects neutron star evolution (e.g., [ 27] for review), through its effect on the
transport properties (e.g., [ 28–33]) and neutrino emissivity (e.g., [ 34–37]). However, in this
paper we concentrate on another aspect of the mantle properties: the elasticity. Indeed, each
pasta-like layer of the mantle is similar to liquid crystal and can support shear stresses (see [ 38],
for example). Its elastic properties can affect present-days observations (e.g., quasi-periodic
oscillations, observed after magnetar ﬂares [ 39–41] as well as constraints on quadrupole ellip-
ticity supported by the crust [ 40]), and, as a part of the crust elasticity, can potentially affect
observations of the third generation of gravitational wave detectors (e.g. [ 42], see, however,
critique in [43]).
The seminal work on the elastic properties of the mantle was the paper [ 38]. Therein, the
authors calculated elastic constants for cylindrical and planar nuclear shapes in the framework
of compressible liquid drop model (CLDM). Most of results were obtained analytically, using
some simpliﬁed assumptions. Elastic properties of the mantle were also studied by molecular
dynamics [ 44] and relativistic-mean-ﬁeld model [ 45]; special attention were paid to the problem
of effective shear modulus in a realistic case in which non-spherical nuclei are not well ordered,
considering global hydrodynamical scales of a star, i.e. the mantle has ‘polycrystalline’ structure
[46].
In this paper we elaborate CLDM for elasticity of the mantle. Namely, we use our recent
work [ 47], where we have demonstrated that shear deformation of neutron star crust induces
quadrupole deformation for the initially spherical nuclei and this effect reduces the effectivearXiv:2305.03603v1  [astro-ph.HE]  5 May 20232 of 12
shear modulus. Here we generalize the approach of [ 47] for cylindrical pasta phases and
consider transversal shear, i.e. shear deformations in the plane, perpendicular to the symmetry
axis of the cylinders. As for spherical nuclei, we demonstrate that the respective elastic constant
(coefﬁcient Cin notations of [ 38]) can be analytically calculated within simpliﬁed Wigner-Seitz
approximation and the result agrees well with accurate lattice-based calculations [ 38], if the
same assumption (enforced circular shape of the cluster cross-section) is applied. As pointed
in [38], shape of nuclear clusters can be affected by transversal shear. We take into account
this effect analytically, allowing nuclear clusters to adjust their shape to minimize energy in
response to the shear of the lattice. We demonstrate that shear deformation indeed enforces
nuclei clusters to have elliptical cross-section and, if one accounts for this effect, one gets 25%
reduction of the respective elastic constant at the most relevant parameters. In Section 2, we
present our formalism and derive the expression for transverse shear modulus for cylindrical
clusters. In Section 3, we show our results and compare them with previous works. In Section
4 we present a brief summary of the results.
2. Formalizm
Nuclear clusters in the mantle have microscopical structure similar to that of liquid crystals
resembling an intermediate state between solids and liquids in terms of elastic properties
[38,44,46]. In what follows, we use terminology and notation of Ref. [ 38]. For the considered
cylindrical phase, three elastic constants B,C, and K3are generally required to describe shear
deformations (the compression is described by the forth constant, the bulk modulus, which
can be easily calculated from the equation of state). The constant Bcharacterises the response
to elongation along the cylindrical axis accompanied by compression in radial direction, K3is
associated with bending, while Cdescribes transverse shear. In this paper we limit ourselves
to the elastic constant C.

boundaries of the Wigner–Seitz cell, dashed lines are circular/elliptical approximations of the cell. Change
of the cluster cross-section in response to the applied shear is schematically shown at the right panel.
To calculate the elastic constant C, we proceed in the same way as in [ 47]. First, we note
that straightforward consideration of deformation for a system of cylindrical clusters, ordered
into perfect static two-dimensional hexagonal lattice (as it was done in [ 38]), is equivalent to
deformation of one unit cell with periodic boundary conditions. It is obvious because the
whole crystal (for both undeformed and deformed states) can be presented as a set of periodic3 of 12
copies of the unit cell. Second, we replace a precise unit cell (regular hexagon) with a smoother
ﬁgure: cylinder with a circular cross-section with radius rcand apply shear deformation
x! x(1+#) (1)
y! y/(1+#) (2)
z! z (3)
for this cell. Here zaxis is along the cylindrical axis and #is an inﬁnitesimally small strain
parameter. As a result of this volume-conserving deformation, the approximate unit cell for
deformed state becomes a cylinder having an elliptical cross-section with semi-axes rc(1+#)
andrc/(1+#)(see Figure 1). High accuracy of the approach based on approximate unit cell is
conﬁrmed below by comparison with the results of [ 38] (for this aim we provide additional
estimate of C, with enforced circular shape of the cluster cross-sections, as it was assumed in
[38]).
By deﬁnition (see equation (11) in [ 38]), for the speciﬁed deformation (equations 1–3), the
energy density change is coupled with the elastic constant Cby
dw=2C#2. (4)
Thus, it is enough to calculate the energy density change dwto estimate C.
To calculate the energy density in deformed and undeformed states we apply compressible
liquid drop model (CLDM) in the same way as in [ 48], i.e. we parametrize surface parameters
for plain interface by neutron chemical potential mn, taking into account neutron adsorption
(adsorption of protons vanishes due to the choice of the reference frame, see supplementary
material in [ 48] for details), but neglect curvature corrections. Below we provide derivations
for non-inverted cylindrical phase,1i.e., we consider a cell with neutron-proton cluster (with
number densities nniand npi) located in a central part, surrounded by neutron matter with
number density nno(see ﬁgure 1). In comparison with [ 38], we allow the cluster cross-section
in the x,yplane to response to the applied shear. As long as we consider inﬁnitesimal deforma-
tions, the cross-section in deformed state can be treated as ellipsoidal with semi-axes rp(1+#p)
andrp/(1+#p). Here #pis an inﬁnitesimal parameter, which allows us to adjust cluster shape
to minimize energy density. Below we consider the case when semi-axis rp(1+#p)of cluster
cross-section lies along x. We have checked that it is this conﬁguration, which corresponds to
the minimal energy density within more general treatment, which allows the cluster deforma-
tion to be oriented arbitrary. Note that, the volume fraction, occupied by the cluster depends
neither on #nor on #pand can be written as u(rp/rc)2. As usual, we assume the cell to be
quasi-neutral, ﬁlled by degenerate electrons with uniform density in the whole cell. As a result,
the energy density is
w=uwb(nni,npi) + ( 1 u)wb(nno,npo=0) +wS+wC+we(ne). (5)
Here, wb(nn,np)is the bulk energy density of uniform nuclear matter at neutron and proton
number densities nnand np,we(ne)is the energy density of degenerate electrons with the
number density ne=u npi. Finally, wSis energy density associated with surface energy of
the cluster and wCis the Coulomb energy density (averaged over cell). These quantities are
derived below.
As usual, within CLDM models, we assume that the internal parameters ( nni,npi,nno,rc,
rp,#p) are adjusted to minimize the energy density at given external parameters. In the case
1Derivations for the inverted phase can be performed straightforwardly by substituting u!1 u, and treating rp
as the linear radius of the neutron phase, located in the center.4 of 12
of deformed lattice, the external parameters are the baryon number density nband the shear
parameter #.
To derive the energy density associated with surface energy wS, we remind that the surface
energy per unit area is s+mnnS, where sis the surface tension, nsis the surface number density
of the adsorbed neutrons (see [ 49,50], for example). The area of the cylindrical cluster is given
by the product of the cluster height 2Hto the perimeter (circumference) of the cluster cross-
section P. It allows to write down the energy density, associated with surface energy, in the
form
wS=(s+mnnS)P
pr2c. (6)
As written above, we assume cluster cross-section to be an ellipse with semi-axes rp(1+#p)
andrp/(1+#p). Assuming #p>0, the major semi-axis is rp(1+#p)and
P=4rp(1+#p)Zp/2

It is easy to check that the same equation also holds true for #p<0(for this aim it is enough to
repeat derivations in this passage, taking into account that the major semi-axis for #p<0is

1 (1+#p)4).
Within CLDM, calculation of the Coulomb energy density wCreduces to the essentially
electrostatic problem: calculation of the energy of neutral system composed of positively
uniformly charged cylinder (protons inside the cluster) inserted into a negatively charged
cylinder (electrons). The Coulomb energy density can be written in the form

where the integrals are taken over vector rin the x,yplane, jp(r)andje(r)are electrostatic
potentials, created by protons and electrons respectively; rp(r)andre(r)are charge densities
of protons and electrons respectively. While considering this electrostatic problem we assume
rp(r) =e npiinside the internal cylinder (cluster) and outside the internal cylinder rp(r) =0;
similarly, re(r) = e neinside the external cylinder (cell) and re(r) =0outside the external
cylinder. Here eis elementary charge.
To apply (9), it is sufﬁcient to know electrostatic potential inside a uniformly charged
(charge density r) cylinder with elliptical cross-section (semi-axes axand ayalong xand y
respectively). This potential can be written as (e.g. [53]):

should be, His cancelled out in the ﬁnal expression.
Now, it is easy to write down equations for internal variables by minimizing the energy
density at ﬁxed nband#. As in the case of spherical nuclei, considered in [ 47], the majority of
internal variables ( nni,npi,nno,rc,rp) can be derived at #=0 up to corrections of order of #2,3

Equations for #=0are well known (e.g., [ 48] in case of spherical nuclei); their physical
meaning are chemical equilibrium within the cell, beta-equilibrium, pressure balance for the
cluster, and the equation for equilibrium size of the cell. The latter is often called virial theorem
(see, for example, [ 1,2]), and it is the only equation, which would be required below in explicit
form:su

Virial theorem allows to exclude s, removing explicit dependence of the subsequent results
on the nuclear physical model. Indeed, the bulk contributions to the total variation of energy

In the case of #=0, considered in [ 6], it agrees with the sum of equations (6)-(9) from that work.

#p=2u

It is worth to stress, that the ¶2dw/¶#2
p, calculated at the optimal value of #p, is positive for
arbitrary ﬁlling factor. Thus the clusters can indeed adjust their shape and become stable with
respect to additional inﬁnitesimal deformations. Stability of cylinders in undeformed lattice
(#=0) was proven in [ 6]. A similar result was obtained in Ref. [ 54], according to which the
spherical nuclei in the crust are stable with respect to inﬁnitesimal quadrupole deformations,
and thus transition from the crust to the mantle is not associated with absolute instability of
spherical nuclei.
3Thanks to minimization procedure over internal variables, corrections of order of #2contribute to the energy at
order of #4, and thus can be neglected6 of 12
To compare our approach with the results of Ref. [ 38], we also consider approximation of
enforced circular shape of cluster cross-section ( #p=0, not adjusted to the deformation). It
leads to a simpliﬁed estimate of transverse shear modulus

comparison, the dotted line indicates similar ratio for spherical clusters, which was obtained
in Ref. [ 47]. One can see that this ratio depends on the shape of the clusters. In particular, for
u0.2, which is typical for transition from spherical to cylindrical clusters (e.g., [ 13]), the
shape of spherical clusters is approximately two times more sensitive to the shear deformations,
than the shape of cylindrical clusters.7 of 12

corresponds to the ﬁt from [45].

shear modulus, normalized to the Coulomb energy density in the non-deformed state w0
C
(see Eq. (11) for #=#p=0) as a function of ﬁlling factor u. The solid line represents our
ﬁnal expression (16), while the long-dashed line is for Eq. (17) ignoring the change of the
cross-section shape. The latter agrees well with the ﬁt provided in [ 38] (see short dashes), which
was based on calculations with accurate treatment of hexagonal (honeycomb) lattice, but with
ﬁxed circular cross-section of the cylindrical clusters. Note, that the authors of [ 38] ﬁtted their
numerical results for reasonable ﬁlling factor u0.20.3 (e.g., [2,13]).
Recently the authors of Ref. [ 45] analysed elastic properties of nuclear pasta in a full three-
dimensional geometry. Their calculations were performed within Thomas-Fermi approach
based on relativistic-mean-ﬁeld model, and thus should include change of the cluster cross-
section shape with increasing deformation. The ﬁt for the transversal shear modulus suggested
in [45] is shown by dotted line in Fig. 3. Obviously, it predicts much smaller suppression of C,
than our result (16).
However, we should note that rather large deformations (from a hexagonal to a simple
lattice) were applied to extract Cin [45]. Namely, the authors of [ 45] performed numerical
simulations for a wide set of deformation parameters at ﬁxed baryon number density and ﬁt the
results by their equation (13). As a result, their equation (13) reproduces well the deformation
energy for the whole deformation path from a hexagonal to another hexagonal lattice via
simple lattice (see ﬁgure 3 in [ 45]). But it has only one ﬁtted parameter (elastic constant, which
we will be denoted as C13). It seems to be mostly affected by the energy difference between
hexagonal and simple lattices (which is indeed perfectly reproduced, according to ﬁgure 3 in
[45]), but not to the details of inﬁnitesimal deformations of hexagonal lattice.
Let us note, that there should be no elliptical deformation of the cluster cross-sections for
both simple and hexagonal lattices due to symmetry. Thus the energy difference between these8 of 12
lattices can be reasonably estimated assuming circular cluster shape. As a result, the effects
of elliptical deformation of cluster cross-section can be suppressed in C13, overestimating the
elastic constant C. Indeed, our attempt to directly ﬁt numerical data, shown in ﬁgure 3 of
[45] for small transversal shear, leads to C0.8C13, i.e. 20% smaller than the estimate of the
shear modulus suggested in [ 45] (the red line at the same plot). Thus, we expect that the actual
transversal shear modulus for inﬁnitesimal deformation of hexagonal lattice can be smaller
than that given by the ﬁnal ﬁt presented in [45] being closer to our Eq. (16).
Unfortunately, we cannot check this hypothesis directly because the ﬁlling factor for
the baryon number density nb=0.06 fm 3, analyzed in their ﬁgure 3, is not quoted in [ 45].
However, we can estimate the ﬁlling factor using ﬁgures in Ref. [ 13]. Indeed, ﬁgure 3 in [ 45]
is plotted for the slope of the symmetry energy L=41.34 MeV . Thus, according to ﬁgure 4
of [13],nb=0.06 fm 3should be close to the transition from spherical to cylindrical clusters,
and according to ﬁgure 3 of same work it should correspond to u0.2. In this case, our Eq.
(16) predicts Cto be suppressed by 6.5% with respect to results for ﬁxed (circular) cluster
cross-section, which almost coincides with C13foru0.2. Formally, it disagrees with the
estimate C0.8C13mentioned above, and suggests that our Eq. (16), in fact, overestimates C.
However, due to qualitative nature of estimates in this passage we prefer to treat this conclusion
as very tentative.
As discussed in [ 19], the actual shape of nuclear clusters at given number density is rather
model dependent, even if nucleon interaction model is ﬁxed. For example, for Skyrme Lyon
nucleon interaction model SLy4 [ 55], which was analyzed in [ 19], the cylindrical clusters are
the most energetically favourable at baryon number density 0.056 fm 3.nb.0.075 fm 3, if
energy density is calculated within ETF approach, while CLDM predicts it to be favourable only
in a narrow region 0.074 fm 3.nb.0.076 fm 3. Thus, to illustrate our results in physical
units (see ﬁgure 4) we use rather wide nbregion; following [ 19], we applied SLy4 nucleon
interaction model for numerical estimates. As in ﬁgure 3, the solid line represents our ﬁnal
expression (16), while the long-dashed line is for equation (17), which ignores the change of the
cross-section shape. Short dashes correspond to the ﬁt provided in [ 38], while dotted line is for
ﬁt [45]. Note, that both ﬁts present the ratio of Cto the Coulomb energy density and in our
calculations we apply CLDM [ 48] to calculate the latter. The upper panel demonstrates cluster
volume fraction u. As discussed in [ 50], the latter quantity can be estimated in so-called bulk
approximation, being weakly dependent on the shape of the clusters and the applied approach
(ETF or CLDM).
For the whole indicated density region our results predict transversal shear modulus C
to be lower, than according to ﬁts from Refs. [ 38] and [ 45]. For low baryon number density
nb.0.065 fm 3it is associated with low volume fraction u.0.15, where ﬁt [ 45] almost
coincides with [ 38]. However, the latter overestimates original numerical calculations of that
work for u.0.15 (see ﬁgure 2 in [ 38]). Thus, we expect that our equation (16) is, in fact, more
accurate than ﬁts of Refs. [ 38] and [ 45] at least for low density region. The larger the density, the
larger is effect of relaxation of the cluster cross-section. For nb&0.07 fm 3it leads to decrease
ofCwith increase of nb, in spite of the fact that Csp, calculated neglecting this effect, increases
with increase of nb.
For comparison, in ﬁgure 4 we also plotted effective shear modulus mfor inner crust
matter, assuming spherical shape of the clusters [ 47]. Thin solid line was calculated taking
into account relaxation of the cluster shape, while dashed line neglects this effect. One can
see that effective shear modulus mis lower than the transversal shear modulus Cfor the
same baryon number density. In principle, it can lead to a jump of elastic properties at the
inner crust/mantle boundary. However, one should take in mind, that it is rather tricky to
estimate effective shear modulus of “polycrystalline” pasta phases (see [ 46] for discussion).
In particular, it can vanish, if pasta elements are spatially uniform (it is because the elastic9 of 12

dashes represent the ﬁt [ 38]; the dotted line corresponds to the ﬁt [ 45]. In addition, thin lines represent
effective shear modulus for spherical nuclear clusters, as it was calculated in [ 47]. Namely, thin solid line
accounts for nuclei deformation (equation 9 in [ 47]), while thin dashed line neglects this effect (equation
6 in [ 47]). The upper panel represents cluster volume fraction u. SLy4 nucleon interaction model [ 55]

[19]).10 of 12
constant, responsible for deformation along the pasta structure, is zero in a strictly uniform
case). So we refrain from speculation on possible observational consequences of the difference
between Candm.
4. Summary and discussion
We analytically derived transversal shear modulus Cfor the sphaghetti phase of nuclear
pasta (see Eq. 16, result for the inverted phase can be obtained using footnote 1). Following
to the predictions of Ref. [ 38], we demonstrated that shear deformation affects the shape of
nuclear clusters (the transversal cluster cross-section becomes elliptical) and we took this effect
into account. It is worth to note, that our ﬁnal expression for Cis explicitly independent of the
parameters of inter-nucleon interaction.
Our results agree with the well-known ﬁt [ 38], if one neglects cluster deformation, as it
was done in [ 38]. Accounting for cluster deformation reduces C(for example, Cis reduced
by 25% at the ﬁlling factor u0.3). However, the practical ﬁt, suggested in the recent paper
[45] on the base of numerical simulations in fully three-dimensional geometry, predicts much
smaller reduction of Cthan in Ref. [ 38]. As we argued in Section 3, this difference can be
associated with numerical procedure in [ 45]. Namely, the practical expression in [ 45], in fact,
suggests a parameter for their equation (13), which allows one to describe deformation energy
for strong transversal deformations, but is not, however, very precise for smaller deformations.
Finally, we should remind that our approach is not exact by construction, being based
on two simpliﬁcations: (1) we neglect curvature corrections to surface tension; (2) we apply
ellipsoidal approximation for the cell cross-section. Both of these approximations can affect C,
and we plan to check their importance in subsequent studies.
