We investigate statistics and scaling laws of avalanches in two-dimensional frictional particles
by numerical simulations. We ﬁnd that the critical exponent for avalanche size distributions is
governed by microscopic friction between the particles in c ontact, where the exponent is larger and
closer to mean-ﬁeld predictions if the friction coeﬃcient i s ﬁnite. We reveal that microscopic “slips”
between frictional particles induce numerous small avalan ches which increase the slope, as well as
the power-law exponent, of avalanche size distributions. W e also analyze statistics and scaling laws
of the avalanche duration and maximum stress drop rates, and examine power spectra of stress drop
rates. Our numerical results suggest that the microscopic f riction is a key ingredient of mean-ﬁeld
descriptions and plays a crucial role in avalanches observe d in real materials.
I. INTRODUCTION
Amorphous solids, e.g. granular materials and glasses,
are ubiquitous in nature and understanding of their me-
chanical properties is crucial to engineering science [1].
When amorphous solids are continuously sheared, one
observes that the system reaches a steady state after the
yielding [2–5], where the increase of stress is (suddenly)
truncated by a plastic event such that the stress ﬂuctu-
ates around its mean value. Such a plastic or stress drop
event is often called avalanche in the literature [6, 7] and
its statistical properties have been widely investigated in
the context of non-equilibrium phase transition [8] such
as the self-organized criticality [9].
Among many theoretical studies, conventional mean
ﬁeld (MF) descriptions have well explained statistics of
avalanches in amorphous solids [10–13]. These MF ap-
proachesarebasedontheanalogybetweenavalancheand
thedepinning transition ofelastic faultsin heterogeneous
media, where interactions between dislocation pairs are
considered as long-ranged [10–13]. Strikingly, power-law
distributionsofthesizeofavalanche,i.e. P(S)∼S−τ,are
predicted by the MF theories, where the MF prediction,
τ= 3/2, is conﬁrmed in a broad range of materials, from
nanocrystals to earthquakes [6, 14–17]. The MF theories
also predict power-law distributions of avalanche dura-
tion (i.e. life time of a stress drop event) as P(T)∼T−κ,
where the theoretical prediction κ= 2 is observed in
experiments [18]. In addition, the scaling of power spec-
tra of stress drop rates is described as P(ω)∼ω−2in
the MF theories, which is well reproduced by the ex-
periments of bulk metallic glasses [19] and astrophysical
objects [18]. Furthermore, scaling laws of the avalanche
sizeS, avalanche duration T, and maximum stress drop
rateMare given by T∼S1/2andM∼S1/2in the MF
descriptions, where both well agreewith experimental re-
sults [18–20].
On the other hand, the power-law exponent τevalu-
ated by numerical simulations tends to be smaller than
the MF prediction ( τ= 3/2). For instance, an ex-
tremely small value for distributions of potential en-ergy drop, i.e. P(∆U)∼∆U−τwithτ= 0.7, was
found in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of two-
dimensionalfoam undershear[21, 22]. In addition, τ= 1
for avalanchesize distributions was reported by athermal
quasi-static (AQS) simulations of two-dimensional soft
particles, whereinteractionsbetweenthe particlesin con-
tact are modeled by a harmonic potential [23]. Moreover,
the exponent seems to be sensitive to particle properties:
Two exponents, τ= 1.15 and 1.25, forP(S) are obtained
from diﬀerent types of the Lennard-Jones potentials [24],
while it can be controlled in the range 1 ≤τ≤1.5 by
the eﬀect of particle inertia [25, 26]. These numerical
results indicate that the concept of universality class of
avalanches [6] is violated in the sense that the critical
exponent τdepends on microscopic details.
In addition to the atomistic (MD and AQS) simula-
tions, mesoscopic elastoplastic (EP) models [7] predict
the exponent in the range 1 .2≤τ≤1.35 depending
on the spatial dimensions [27–33]. Diﬀerent from the
conventional MF approaches, the EP models employ an
anisotropic propagator in the governing equation of local
stress, where the propagator is long-ranged and obeys
quadrupolar symmetry in the shear plane (as Eshelby’s
inclusion) [7]. Then, on the basis of the analogy between
avalanche and the yielding transition , Lin et al. sug-
gestedscaling relations , where the exponent τis given
by the spatial dimension d, fractal dimension df, and
power-law exponent for distributions of local distance to
yield stress θ[30, 31]. Note that the recent study of
discrete dislocation dynamics also pointed out dissimi-
larities between the MF descriptions (i.e. the analogy to
the depinning) and avalanches [34]. Furthermore, recent
experiments and simulations of two-dimensional granu-
lar materials reported similar power-law distributions of
avalanche energy, i.e. P(E)∼E−1.24andE−1.43, respec-
tively [35].
Because of the discrepancy in the MF theories, exper-
iments, atomistic simulations, and mesoscopic models,
many factors, e.g. system sizes [24, 36, 37], driving rates
[29], and temperature [38, 39], have been examined by
numerical studies of avalanches. However, much less at-
tentionhasbeen paidtothe eﬀectof microscopic friction ,2
i.e. the dynamical or Coulomb friction between the par-
ticles in contact [40]. The microscopic friction is intrinsic
to amorphous solids in nature, e.g. granular materials,
and thus it is important to clarify how the microscopic
friction aﬀects the statistics of avalanches (especially the
exponent τ) and scaling laws.
In this paper, we numerically investigate statistics and
scaling laws of avalanches in two-dimensional frictional
particles. By using the frictional contact model [40], we
implement the microscopic friction into MD simulations.
We ﬁnd that the statistics and scaling laws approach the
MF predictions if the friction coeﬃcient is ﬁnite. Inter-
estingly, the exponent τis well described by the scaling
relationsproposedby Lin etal. [30, 31] ifthe microscopic
friction is absent, i.e. if the system is frictionless . How-
ever, they do not hold in frictional systems. We show
that the drop of tangential stress contributes to the pop-
ulation of small avalanches, which eventually increases
the exponent τin frictional systems.
In the following, we explain our numerical methods in
Sec. II and show our numerical results in Sec. III. In Sec.
IV, we discuss and conclude our ﬁndings.
II. METHODS
We study two-dimensional soft athermal particles by
MD simulations. To avoid crystallization, we use 50 : 50
binary mixtures of Nparticles, where diﬀerent kinds of
particles have the same mass mand diﬀerent diameters
(their ratio is 1 .4) [41]. The force between the parti-
cles in contact is divided into normal and tangential di-
rections [40]: The normal force fnis modeled by a lin-
ear spring-dashpot, where the spring constant and vis-
cosity coeﬃcient are given by knandηn, respectively.
The tangential force ftis also described by the linear
spring-dashpot with the same spring constant and vis-
cosity coeﬃcient, i.e. kt=knandηt=ηn, respectively.
However, it switches to dynamical friction µ|fn|with
the friction coeﬃcient µif it exceeds a threshold, i.e. if
|ft|> µ|fn|. We adjust the spring constant and viscosity
coeﬃcient as the normal restitution coeﬃcient is given
bye= exp(−π//radicalbig
2knη−2n−1)≃0.7 [40]. In addition,
we introduce a time unit as t0≡ηn/kn=ηt/kt.
We randomly distribute the Nparticles in an L×L
square periodic box, where the area fraction of the parti-
cles is given by φ= 0.9. We then apply simple shear de-
formationstothe systemunderthe Lees-Edwardsbound-
ary condition [42]. In each time step, every particle
position ri= (xi,yi) is replaced with ( xi+δγyi,yi)
(i= 1,...,N) and equations of translational and rota-
tional motions are numerically integrated with a small
time increment δt[43]. Here, we use δγ= 10−7for the
strain increment.
In the following analyses, we control the parameters, µ
andN, and scale every mass, time, and length by m,t0,
and the mean particle diameter d0, respectively. In ad-
dition, we only analyze the data in a steady state, wherethe amount of shear strain exceeds unity γ >1.
III. RESULTS
In this section, we show our numerical results of stress-
strain curves (Sec. IIIA) and explain stress drop events
(Sec. IIIB). We examine the MF predictions of statistics
of avalanches (Sec. IIIC) and scaling laws of avalanches
(Sec. IIID) with the focus on the inﬂuence of microscopic
friction. Then, we discuss the system size dependence of
our results and explain the characteristic exponent for
avalanche size distributions (Sec. IIIE).
A. Stress ﬂuctuations
We measure mechanical responses of the system to the
applied strain γby the shear stress σ. Neglecting kinetic
contributions to the stress, we calculate the stress tensor
according to σαβ=−L−2/summationtext
i<jfijαrijβ(α,β=x,y),
wherefijαis theα-component of the force between the
particles ( iandj) in contact and rijβis theβ-component
of the relative position between them. The shear stress
is deﬁned as the average of the oﬀ-diagonal elements, i.e.
σ≡(σxy+σyx)/2. Note that the α-component of the
force consists of the normal and tangential forces, i.e. fn
andft(see Sec. II). Accordingly, the shear stress can be
decomposed into two parts as
σ=σn+σt, (1)
whereσnandσtare the normal and tangential parts of
the shear stress, respectively [44]. If the system is fric-
tionless ( µ= 0), we ﬁnd σ=σnandσt= 0, whereas
σt∝negationslash= 0 in frictional systems ( µ >0). Because the tan-
gential force does not exceed the threshold µ|fn|,σtis
smaller than σnas long as µ <1, where we conﬁrmed
that the mean values in a steady state satisfy the follow-
ing relation,
∝angbracketleftσt∝angbracketright ≪ ∝angbracketleftσn∝angbracketright ≃ ∝angbracketleftσ∝angbracketright. (2)
To study statistics of avalanches, we carefully look at
ﬂuctuations of the stress, i.e. δσ≡σ−∝angbracketleftσ∝angbracketright,δσn≡σn−
∝angbracketleftσn∝angbracketright, andδσt≡σt−∝angbracketleftσt∝angbracketright, in a steady state. Figure 1(a)

(Fig. 1(b)), the normal part is strongly correlated with
the total shear stress. On the other hand, uandutare

B. Stress drop events
As shown in Fig. 1(a), the stress in a steady state ﬂuc-
tuates around its mean value such that numerous stress
drop events, or avalanches , can be observed. To quantify
such stress drop events, we calculate a stress drop ampli-
tude as ∆ σ≡σ(γ)−σ(γ+T)>0, where the shear stress
starts decreasing at the strain γand stops decreasing at
γ+T[45]. Here, Tis the so-called avalanche duration
[12, 18, 20] and the avalanche size is introduced as an
extensive quantity, S≡L2∆σ, as usual [25–27, 29].
The avalanche duration Tis also deﬁned such that the
stress drop rate is negative, i.e. dσ/dγ < 0, in the strain
rangebetween γandγ+T[45]. Therefore,wecanextract
themaximum stress drop rate during an avalanche [19,
20] as
M≡ −/parenleftbiggdσ
dt/parenrightbigg
max. (6)
We also introduce the avalanche interval ∆γsuch thatthe stress drop rate is positive, i.e. dσ/dγ > 0, in the
strain interval between γandγ+∆γ.
C. Statistics of avalanches
To clarify the eﬀects of microscopic friction on statis-
tics of avalanches, we examine the MF predictions of
avalanche size distributions (Sec. IIIC1), distributions
of the avalanche duration (Sec. IIIC2), and power spec-
tra of stress drop rates (Sec. IIIC3).
1. Avalanche size distributions
First, we analyzestatistics of avalanchesizes S. Figure
2(a) displays probability distribution functions (PDFs)
of avalanche sizes, or avalanche size distributions ,P(S),
where the friction coeﬃcient µincreases as indicated by
the arrow (and listed in the legend). If the avalanche size
is not too small ( S >10−4), the avalanche size distribu-
tions exhibit the power-law decay,
P(S)∼S−τ(7)
with the exponent τ. The power law (Eq. (7)) is followed
by a “bump” in large avalanche sizes ( S >1) due to the
particle inertia as reported in Refs. [25–27]. Therefore,
thescaling regime [18], where the avalanchesize distribu-
tions exhibit the power law, is in the range 10−4< S <1
in our MD simulations.
The exponent τhas been extensively studied by the
theories [10–13, 46], experiments [14, 15, 18–20], and nu-
merical simulations [7, 21–26] (as reviewed in Sec. I).
Here, we estimate τby ﬁtting the power law (Eq. (7)) to
the data of P(S) in the scaling regime, 10−4< S <1.
We ﬁnd that τ≃0.98 (dotted line) for frictionless parti-
cles (µ= 0), while τ≃1.33 (solid line) for the frictional
system with µ= 0.1. The exponent for the frictionless
system agrees with the previous result of soft athermal
particlesundershear[23]. Ontheotherhand,thatforthe
frictional particles is much closer to the MF prediction,
i.e.τ= 3/2 [10, 12–15, 18, 19], and results of EP models,
i.e.τ≃1.35 [30, 31]. Increasing the friction coeﬃcient
fromµ= 0 to 0 .1, we observe that the avalanche size
distribution develops a “plateau” in small avalanches,
S <10−4(Fig. 2(a)). Meanwhile, the exponent exhibits
a transition from τ≃0.98 to 1.33. Therefore, the micro-
scopic friction strongly aﬀects the statistics of avalanche
sizes and seems to play an important role in the MF ap-
proach to avalanches [6].
2. Distributions of the avalanche duration
Next, we examine statistics of the avalanche duration
T. The MF theory predicts that PDFs of the avalanche
duration show the power-law decay,
P(T)∼T−κ(8)4
with the exponent κ= 2 [12, 18]. Figure 2(b) displays
our numerical results of the PDFs, where we increase
the friction coeﬃcient µas indicated by the arrow (and
listed in the legend). In this ﬁgure, we can hardly see the
power-law behavior of P(T) in frictionless particles ( µ=
0). However, increasing µ, we observe that the PDFs
changetheir shapesand exhibit the powerlaw(solid line)
in the case of µ= 0.1. We estimate the exponent as
κ= 1.30 by ﬁtting the power law (Eq. (8)) to the data
ofP(T) in the scaling regime, 10−6< T <10−4. Note
that our exponent, κ= 1.30, is smaller than the MF
prediction, κ= 2 [12, 18]. In addition, the power law
(Eq. (8)) is followed by a bump in the large avalanche
duration ( T >10−4) as in the case of avalanche size
distributions (Fig. 2(a)).
3. Power spectra of stress drop rates
We also examine the power spectrum of stress drop
rateF(ω)≡ |ˆf(ω)|2, where ˆf(ω) =/integraltext∞
0(−dσ/dt)e−iωtdt
withthefrequency ωistheFouriertransformofthestress
drop rate in a steady state [47]. Figure 2(c) shows our
numerical results of the power spectra, where both the
dashed and solid lines represent the MF prediction, i.e.
F(ω)∼ω−1/σνz(9)
with the exponent 1 /σνz= 2 [12, 13, 18, 19]. Increasing
the friction coeﬃcient µ(as indicated by the arrow and
listed in the legend), we observe that the lower bound of
the powerlaw(Eq. (9)), i.e. the corner frequency [48], de-
creases. For instance, the power-lawdecaybegins around
ω= 10−1(10−3) ifµ= 0 (0.1). Therefore, the scaling
regime for Eq. (9) shifts to lower frequencies in frictional
particles.
D. Scaling laws of avalanches
The MF theory also predicts that both the avalanche
duration Tand maximum stress drop rate Mscale as the
square root of the avalanche size S, i.e.
T∼S1/2, (10)
M∼S1/2. (11)
The MF predictions (Eqs. (10) and (11)) were conﬁrmed
by experiments of bulk metallic glasses and granular ma-
terials [20]. We also examine Eqs. (10) and (11) with the
focus on the inﬂuence of microscopic friction. In Figs.
3(a) and (b), we test the scaling laws of TandM, re-
spectively, for the case of frictional system with µ= 0.2.
Here, the data of S,T, andMare taken from 106stress
drop events in a steady state and the symbols (circles)
are the averages of (a) Tand (b) Min each bin of S.
The solid lines represent the scaling laws, Eqs. (10) and
(11), which well describe our numerical results in the
scaling regime, 10−2< S <102. In Fig. 3(a), the lowerbound of the avalanche duration is given by the strain
increment, i.e. T≥δγ= 10−7. If the avalanche dura-
tion equals δγ, the maximum stress drop rate is given by
M= ∆σ/δt=S/L2δt(see Eq. (6)) so that Mis linear
in the avalanche size S. Therefore, the maximum stress
drop rates for small avalanchesare bounded by the linear
scaling,M∝S(dashed line in Fig. 3(b)).
To examine the inﬂuence of microscopic friction on
the scaling laws (Eqs. (10) and (11)), we plot the ra-
tios,T/S1/2andM/S1/2, i.e.shape indexes [20], in Figs.
3(c) and (d), respectively. In these ﬁgures, we vary the
friction coeﬃcient from µ= 0 to 0 .1 as indicated by
the arrow (and listed in the legend). The ratios are al-
most ﬂat in the scaling regime (10−2< S <102) regard-
less ofµso that the scaling laws are quite insensitive
to the microscopic friction. However, T/S1/2(M/S1/2)
exhibits a “dip” (“peak”) around S= 10−4whenµin-
creases. Therefore, the scaling law overestimates (un-
derestimates) T(M) in frictional systems outside of the
scaling regime, S <10−2.
E. System size dependence and the exponent for
avalanche size distributions
As shown in the previous sections, the most strik-
ing diﬀerence between frictionless ( µ= 0) and frictional
(µ >0) systems is the exponent τfor the avalanche size
distributions P(S). Toclarifytheoriginofthisdiﬀerence,
westudythesystemsizedependenceofavalanchesinfric-
tionless (Sec. IIIE1) and frictional particles (IIIE2).
1. Frictionless particles
To explain the exponent τfor the frictionless system
(µ= 0), we demonstrate the ﬁnite size scaling of the
mean avalanche size ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketrightand interval ∝angbracketleft∆γ∝angbracketright, which has
been well established by EP models [30, 31, 49]. We
calculate the mean values, ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketrightand∝angbracketleft∆γ∝angbracketright, by taking the
averages of avalanche size and interval over 106stress
drop events in a steady state. Figure 4 displays (a) ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketright
and (b)∝angbracketleft∆γ∝angbracketrightin the frictionlesssystem asfunctions ofthe
system size (the number of particles) N, where we con-
ﬁrm the power laws, ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketright ∼Nαand∝angbracketleft∆γ∝angbracketright ∼N−χ(solid
lines). The power-law exponents are given by α≃0.31
andχ≃0.62, which reasonably agree with the scaling
relationin Refs. [49],
α+χ= 1. (12)
We also calculate the cutoﬀ size as [49]
Sc≡∝angbracketleftS2∝angbracketright
∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketright. (13)
As shown in Fig. 4(a) (dotted line), the cutoﬀ size ex-
hibits the power law Sc∼Ndf/dwith the spatial dimen-
siond= 2 and fractal dimension df≃0.58. By using5

the arrows and listed in the legends. The dashed (solid) line in (a) indicates the power-law decay P(S)∼S−τ(Eq. (7)) with
the exponent τ≃0.98 (1.33). The solid line in (b) represents P(T)∼T−κ(Eq. (8)) with κ= 1.30. Both the dashed and

positions to prevent overlap.
another scaling relation [49],
τ= 2−αd
df, (14)
we can estimate the exponent τfromαanddf. We ﬁnd
τ≃0.93 from Eq. (14) which reasonably agrees with
τ≃0.98 obtained by ﬁtting Eq. (7) to the data of P(S)
(dotted line in Fig. 2(a)). Therefore, the exponent τfor
avalanche size distributions in the frictionless system can
be explained by the ﬁnite size scaling of ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketright,∝angbracketleft∆γ∝angbracketright, and
Sc[30, 31, 49].
2. Frictional particles
The system sizedependence ofthe mean avalanchesize
∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketrightand interval ∝angbracketleft∆γ∝angbracketrightin frictional systems is entirely dif-
ferent from that in the frictionless system. In Appendix
, we examine the dependence of the mean values, ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketright
and∝angbracketleft∆γ∝angbracketright, on the system size Nand friction coeﬃcient
µ. We ﬁnd that their dependence on Nis sensitive to
µso that the scaling relations established for the case of
µ= 0 (Eqs. (12) and (14)) arenot applicable to frictional
particles, µ >0 (see Appendix ).
To reveal how the microscopic friction alters the ex-
ponentτfor avalanche size distributions P(S), we ana-
lyzenormalandtangentialcontributionstotheavalanche
sizeS. As shown in Sec. IIIA, the shear stress σis di-
vided into the normal and tangential parts as σnandσt,respectively (Eq. (1)). Accordingly, we distinguish the
avalanche size as Sn≡L2∆σnandSt≡L2∆σt, and
avalanche interval as ∆ γnand ∆γt. Figure 5(a) displays
the mean avalanche sizes, ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketright,∝angbracketleftSn∝angbracketright, and∝angbracketleftSt∝angbracketright, as func-
tions of the friction coeﬃcient µ. As can be seen, the
mean avalanche size of normal part is one to two decades
larger than that of tangential part, where a relation,
log10∝angbracketleftSt∝angbracketright<log10∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketright<log10∝angbracketleftSn∝angbracketright,(15)
holdsregardlessof µ(weuse log10tonotice the diﬀerence
in logscale). In frictional systems, microscopic “slip” be-
tween the particles in contact, i.e. the switch from the
tangential force |ft|to Coulomb friction µ|fn|, is respon-
sible for the avalancheof tangential part St. Ifµis small,
thefrictionalparticlescaneasily“slip”sothat theenergy
to be released at a tangential stress drop is small. Thus,
the mean avalanche size ∝angbracketleftSt∝angbracketrightdecreases with the decrease
ofµas shown in Fig. 5(a). On the other hand, the mean
size of normal part ∝angbracketleftSn∝angbracketrightincreases with the decrease of µ
such that the mean avalanche size ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketrightis quite insensitive
to the strength of microscopic friction. In addition, the
mean avalanche intervals satisfy
log10∝angbracketleft∆γt∝angbracketright<log10∝angbracketleft∆γ∝angbracketright<log10∝angbracketleft∆γn∝angbracketright(16)
regardless of µ(Fig. 5(b)). Therefore, microscopic slips
which trigger small avalanches of tangential part Stare
more frequent than normal stress drop events. This
means that numerous small avalanches happen in fric-6

tion of small Sin the avalanche size distribution P(S).
Accordingly, the exponent τbecomes larger (and closer
to the MF prediction) than that in the frictionless case.
To conﬁrm our interpretation on the exponent τfor
frictional systems, we compare the PDFs of normal
and tangential parts, i.e. P(Sn) andP(St), with the
avalanche size distribution, P(S). Figure 6 displays the
PDFs,P(S),P(Sn), andP(St), where we use N= 8192
frictional particles with µ= 0.1 (note that a similaranalysis has recently been proposed in Ref. [50]). In
this ﬁgure, both the plateau of P(S) in small avalanches
(S <10−4) and power-law decay of P(S) in the scal-
ing regime (10−4< S <1) are well represented by the
PDF of tangential part P(St), where the solid line is the
power-law decay (Eq. (7)) with the exponent τ= 1.33 as
in Fig. 2(a). On the other hand, both the bump of P(S)
in large avalanches ( S >1) and tail of P(S) correspond
to those of the PDF of normal part P(Sn). Because the
normalandtangentialpartsofthestressareuncorrelated
(Sec. IIIA), we crudely estimate P(S)∼P(St)+P(Sn),
where the power-law exponent is solely determined by
the PDF of tangential part, i.e. P(St)∼S−τ
t.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this study, we have numerically investigated stress
drop events, or avalanches, in two-dimensional frictional
particles under shear. Our focus was the eﬀect of micro-
scopicfrictiononstatistics(Sec. IIIC)andscalinglawsof
avalanches (Sec. IIID). Based on the MF predictions, we
examined the avalanche size distributions P(S), PDFs
of the avalanche duration P(T), and power spectra of
stress drop rates F(ω). We found that the avalanche size
distributions exhibit the power law, P(S)∼S−τ(Eq.
(7)), in the scaling regime 10−4< S < 1, where the7

solid line indicates the power-law decay (Eq. (7)) with the e x-
ponentτ= 1.33 as in Fig. 2(a). The system size and friction
coeﬃcient are given by N= 8192 and µ= 0.1, respectively.
power-law exponent for frictional particles, τ= 1.33, is
larger and closer to the MF prediction ( τ= 3/2) and
results of the EP models ( τ= 1.35) than that for fric-
tionless particles, τ= 0.98. If the friction coeﬃcient is
ﬁniteµ >0, the PDFs of the avalanche duration also
show the power-law decay P(T)∼T−κ(Eq. (8)) in the
scaling regime 10−6< T <10−4though the exponent
κ= 1.30 is smaller than the MF value κ= 2. On the
other hand, we cannot observe the power-law behavior of
P(T) if the system is frictionless µ= 0. The MF theory
well explains our numerical results of the power spectra,
i.e.F(ω)∼ω−2, regardless of µ. However, we found
that the lower bound of the power law (i.e. the corner
frequency) decreases with the increase of µsuch that the
scaling regime (for the spectra) shifts to lower frequen-
cies in frictional systems. We also examined the scaling
laws of the avalanche duration and maximum stress drop
rate, i.e. T∼S1/2andM∼S1/2(Eqs. (10) and (11)),
and found that both are correct in the scaling regime10−2< S <102regardless of µ. The inﬂuence of mi-
croscopic friction emerges outside of the scaling regime
(aroundS= 10−4); the small dip and peak appear in the
shape indexes, T/S1/2andM/S1/2, respectively. The
most striking diﬀerence between the frictionless and fric-
tionalsystemsisthediﬀerentexponentsfortheavalanche
size distributions, τ. To clarify the origin of the diﬀer-
ence, we demonstrated the ﬁnite size scaling (Sec. IIIE).
If the system is frictionless µ= 0, the exponent τis
well explained by the scaling relations between the spa-
tial dimension, fractal dimension, and power-law expo-
nents for the mean avalanche size ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketrightand interval ∝angbracketleft∆γ∝angbracketright
(Eqs. (12) and (14)). However, the scaling relations do
not hold in frictional systems µ >0 and cannot explain
the exponent τwhich is closer to the MF prediction. To
understand the exponent for frictional systems, we an-
alyzed the avalanches of normal and tangential parts of
the shearstress. We found that the tangentialpart of the
stress contributes to small sized avalanches. In addition,
the avalanches of tangential part are more frequent than
those of normal part. Because the normal and tangential
partsareuncorrelated(Sec. IIIA), weconcluded that nu-
merous small avalanches of the tangential stress increase
the slope of the avalanche size distribution, which even-
tually increases the power-law exponent τfor frictional
particles.
A. The role of microscopic friction in the MF
approach to avalanches
From our numerical results, we ﬁnd that the statistics
ofavalanches(especiallytheexponent τ) in frictionalsys-
tems are close to the MF prediction and results of the
EP models. Both the MF theory [10–13] and EP models
[7, 27, 29] are based on non-local constitutive equations
of stress, where the elastic propagator of local deforma-
tions is assumed to be long-ranged (though anisotropic
quadrupolar symmetry is introduced to that in the EP
models). It is known that, if the microscopic friction is
present, the system exhibits a sudden increase of stress
suchasshear jamming [51]anddiscontinuous shear thick-
ening[52–60], where force chains are percolated through
the system under shear. The percolated force chains are
reminiscent of long-range spatial correlations and analo-
gous to the propagatorin the MF theory and EP models.
Therefore, we suppose that the microscopic friction is a
key ingredient of the MF approach and plays a crucial
role in avalanches observed in real materials.
B. Future works
In our MD simulations, we ﬁxed the area fraction of
the particles to φ= 0.9 which is far above the jamming
transition density φJ≃0.8433 [61–63]. However, me-
chanical properties of soft athermal particles drastically
change if the system approachesthe onset of unjamming,8
i.e.φ→φJ[64–69]. Thus, it is an important next step
to study how the avalanche statistics and scaling laws
are aﬀected by the proximity to jamming. We also ﬁxed
the strain increment to δγ= 10−7, where the shear rate
is given by ˙ γ≡δγ/δt= 10−6t−1
0in our unit. However,
it is known that the shape of avalanche size distribution
[70], as well as the exponent τ[29], is sensitive to ˙ γ.
Therefore, it is also important to investigate the eﬀects
of driving rate [71] or time resolution [72] on our numer-
ical results. We employed the spring-dashpot model for
the interaction between the particles in contact (Sec. II)
as a canonical model of granular materials [40]. How-
ever, interaction forces drastically change the ﬂow be-
havior of soft athermal particles, e.g. the force law of
viscous damping controls the shear thinning/thickening
[73] and the ﬂow curves are nonmonotonic if one intro-
duces cohesive forces [74, 75]. Therefore, it is interesting
to examine how the interaction forces alter the avalanche
statistics and scaling laws. In addition, we had not ana-
lyzed spatial structures of the system such as non-aﬃne
displacements of the particles [76–88] and spatial corre-
lations of the stress [89–92]. Thus, detailed studies of the
link between statistics and spatial structures are left for
future. Similarly, anisotropy induced by shear [93–99],
e.g. shear-bands, should be examined in future. More-
over, further studies in three dimensions are crucial to
practical applications of our results [100].

Appendix: Finite size scaling in frictional systems
In this appendix, we explain how the microscopic fric-
tion alters the ﬁnite size scaling established for the fric-
tionless system and discuss the frictionless limit .
Figure 7 displays (a) the mean avalanche size ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketrightand
(b) mean avalanche interval ∝angbracketleft∆γ∝angbracketrightas functions of the fric-
tion coeﬃcient µ >0, where we change the system size
Nas listed in the legend of (a). As can be seen, the
system size dependence of ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketrightand∝angbracketleft∆γ∝angbracketrightis sensitive to
µso that the scaling relations established for the case ofµ= 0 (Eqs. (12) and (14)) are not applicable to µ >0.
In this ﬁgure, we also show (c) the mean avalanche dura-
tion∝angbracketleftT∝angbracketrightand (d) mean maximum stress drop rate ∝angbracketleftM∝angbracketrightas
functions of µ. All the mean values signiﬁcantly deviate
from the frictionless cases (horizontal dashed lines) if the
friction coeﬃcient exceeds the critical value µc∼10−5.
Here, the critical value can be estimated as follows: In
each time step, the strain increment δγis applied to the
system, where the tangential displacement between the
particles in contact is roughly estimated as d0δγwith
