ABSTRACT . In this note, we consider the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equat ion with constant mobility and singular
potential in three dimensional bounded and smooth domains. Given any global solution (whose existence and
uniqueness are already known), we prove the so-called instantaneous anduniform separation property: any
global solution with initial ﬁnite energy is globally conﬁn ed (in the L∞metric) in the interval [−1+δ,1−δ]
on the time interval [τ,∞)for anyτ >0, whereδonly depends on the norms of the initial datum, τand the
parameters of the system. We then exploit such result to impr ove the regularity of the global attractor for the
dynamical system associated to the problem.

1. I NTRODUCTION AND MAIN RESULTS
We study the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation (see [ 13,17,18])
∂tφ= ∆(F′(φ)−J∗φ)inΩ×(0,∞), (1.1)
whereΩis a smooth and bounded domain in R3. The state variable φrepresents the difference of the
concentrations of two ﬂuids. This equation is commonly rewr itten as
∂tφ= ∆µ, µ=F′(φ)−J∗φinΩ×(0,∞), (1.2)
which is equipped with the following boundary and initial co nditions
∂nµ= 0 on∂Ω×(0,T), φ(·,0) =φ0inΩ, (1.3)

The analysis of the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with lo garithmic potential ( 1.20) (actually a more
general class of singular potentials) has been ﬁrstly studied in [ 13] (see also [ 11] for another proof of exis-
tence and [ 15] for the viscous case). In particular, the authors in [ 13] proved the existence and uniqueness
of global weak solutions and their propagation of regularit y for positive times (see proof of Theorem 1.2
below for more details). Such solutions satisfy
φ∈L∞(Ω×(0,∞))with|φ(x,t)|<1for a.e.x∈Ω,∀t >0. (1.6)
Such property has an important physical meaning since the so lutionφtakes value in the signiﬁcant interval
[−1,1](cf. deﬁnition of φ). Concerning the regularity of the global solutions, a main task consists in estab-
lishingLpestimates of F′′(φ)andF′′′(φ), which are needed to prove the existence of classical solutions.
This is a difﬁcult question due to the growth conditions
F′′(s)≤CeC|F′(s)|,|F′′′(s)| ≤CF′′(s)2, (1.7)
which prevent the possibility to control F′′(φ)orF′′′(φ)inLpspaces in terms of some Lpnorms of F′(φ)
(as possible in the case of potential with polynomial growth ). However, although Lpestimates of F′′(φ)
andF′′′(φ)can be useful, this is not sufﬁcient (in many cases) to prove h igher order regularity, and it is
necesssary to show the instanteneous (also called strict )separation property : for any τ >0, there exists
δ=δ(τ)∈(0,1)such that
|φ(x,t)| ≤1−δ,for all(x,t)∈Ω×(τ,∞). (1.8)
We point out that the separation property is expected due to t he gradient ﬂow structure of the Cahn-Hilliard
model, which drives the dynamics towards stationary states of the free energy consisting of separated
functional minima. In [ 13], a ﬁrst proof of ( 1.8) has been established in [ 13, Theorem 5.2] in the two
dimensional case. The argument hinges upon an iterative Ali kakos-Moser argument for the powers of F′(φ)
combined with Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequal ities and the Trudinger-Moser inequality. A new
proof of such result admitting a more general class of singul ar potentials has been proposed in [ 14, Section
4]. The latter relies on a De Giorgi’s iterative argument. Th is method is usually employed to obtain an
L∞estimate of the solution to a second order PDE, thereby the ma in achievement in [ 14] was to recast the
method in order to get a speciﬁc bound (cf. ( 1.8) with ( 1.6)). More recently, the separation property hasON THE NONLOCAL CAHN-HILLIARD EQUATION IN THREE DIMENSIONS 3
been proven in three dimensions in [ 28], which allowed to show the convergence to stationary state s. The
author in [ 28] improved the method in [ 14] in two ways: the truncated functions φn(see proof of Theorem
1.2below) are shown to be bounded by 2δ(instead of 1as in [ 14]) and a Poincar´ e type inequality for time-
dependent functions is employed to avoid the integrals of φn(see term Z2in [14, Section 4]). However, a
main drawback of the argument, which is due to the latter ingr edient, is that the value of δin (1.8) depends
on the particular solution. More precisely, δcannot be estimated only in terms of norm of the initial data and
the parameters of the system. The purpose of this work is to de monstrate that the De Giorgi iterative scheme
in [14] and the observation /ba∇dblφn/ba∇dblL∞≤2δare sufﬁcient to achieve ( 1.8) with a value δwhich depends on τ,
the initial energy ENL(φ0)) and the parameters of the system (e.g. F,Ω,J). Beyond its intrinsic interest,
this allows us to improve the regularity of the global attrac tor for the dynamical system associated to the
system ( 1.2)-(1.3).
In order to present the main results of this work, let us formu late the assumptions for the admissible class
of potentials:
(A1)F∈C([−1,1])∩C2(−1,1)such that lim|s|→1F′(s) =±∞ andF′′(s)≥θ >0for alls∈
(−1,1).
(A2) There exists ε0>0such that F′′is monotone non-decreasing on [1−ε0,1)and non-increasing in
(−1,1+ε0].
(A3) There exist ε1∈(0,1
2)andCF≥1such that
1
F′(1−2δ)≤CF
|ln(δ)|,1
F′(−1+2δ)≤CF
|ln(δ)|,∀0< δ≤ε1 (1.9)
and1
F′′(1−2δ)≤CFδ,1
F′′(−1+2δ)≤CFδ,∀0< δ≤ε1. (1.10)
Remark 1.1. The assumptions ( A1)-(A3) are satisﬁed by the convex part of the Flory-Huggins potent ial
(1.4).
The main result reads as follows
Theorem 1.2. Assume that ( A1)-(A3) hold. Let JbeW1,1
loc(R3)such that J(x) =J(−x)for allx∈R3.
Assume that φ0∈L∞(Ω)such that /ba∇dblφ0/ba∇dblL∞(Ω)≤1and|φ0|=|Ω|−1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraltext
Ωφ0(x)dx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle<1. Then, for any
τ >0, there exists δ∈(0,1)such that the unique global solution to (1.2)-(1.3)satisﬁes
|φ(x,t)| ≤1−δ,for a.e.(x,t)∈Ω×[τ,∞). (1.11)
In addition, there exists three positive constants C1,C2,C3andα∈(0,1)such that
sup
t≥τ/ba∇dblµ(t)/ba∇dblL∞(Ω)≤C1,sup
t≥τ/ba∇dbl∂tµ/ba∇dblL2(t,t+1;L2(Ω)≤C2, (1.12)
and
|φ(x1,t1)−φ(x2,t2)| ≤C3/parenleftbig
|x1−x2|α+|t1−t2|α
2/parenrightbig
, (1.13)
for any(x1,t1),(x2,t2)∈Ωt=Ω×[t,t+1], for anyt≥τ. The values of δ,C1,C2,C3andαonly depend
onτ,δ, the initial energy ENL(φ0), the initial mean φ0and the parameters of the system (i.e. F,J,Ω).
Remark 1.3. A combination of the separation property (1.11)and the H ¨older regularity (1.13)gives the
following stronger result
|φ(x,t)| ≤1−δ,∀(x,t)∈Ω×[τ,∞). (1.14)4 ON THE NONLOCAL CAHN-HILLIARD EQUATION IN THREE DIMENSION S
As a direct consequence of Theorem 1.2, we infer additional features of the longtime behavior of th e
solutions of system ( 1.2)-(1.3). Let us introduce the dynamical system associated with pro blem ( 1.2)-(1.3).
For any given m∈(0,1), we deﬁne the phase space
Hm=/braceleftbig
φ∈L∞(Ω) :/ba∇dblφ/ba∇dblL∞(Ω)≤1and−1+m≤φ≤1−m/bracerightbig
(1.15)
endowed with the metric
d(φ1,φ2) =/ba∇dblφ1−φ2/ba∇dblL2(Ω). (1.16)
The pair(Hm,d)is a complete metric space. Then, we deﬁne the map
S(t) :Hm→ Hm, S(t)φ0=φ(t),∀t≥0,
whereφis the global (weak) solution (see [ 13, Theorem 3.4]) originating from the initial condition φ0.
It was shown in [ 13, Section 4] that (Hm,S(t))is a dissipative dynamical system and S(t)is a closed
semigroup on the phase space Hm(see [ 27]). Furthermore, the existence of the global attractor Amwas
proven in [ 13, Theorem 4.4]. In particular, it is shown that Amis a bounded set in Hm∩H1(Ω). Our next
result is concerned with the regularity of the global attrac torAm.
Theorem 1.4. Let ( A1)-(A3) hold. Assume that J∈W1,1
loc(R3)such that J(x) =J(−x)for allx∈R3.
Consider the connected global attractor Amassociated with the dynamical system (Hκ,S(t)). Then,Am⊂
BL∞(Ω)(0,1−δ)and is bounded in Cα(Ω).
Before proceeding with the proofs of the main results, it wor th presenting a wider picture about the
validity of the separation property for other Cahn-Hilliar d equations. First, we recall the nonlocal Cahn-
Hilliard equation with non-constant degenerate mobility
∂tφ= div/parenleftbig
(1−φ2)∇µ/parenrightbig
, µ=F′(φ)−J∗φinΩ×(0,∞), (1.17)
which is completed with ( 1.3). In this case, the separation property has been previously proven by [ 23] in
both two and three dimensions (see also [ 10]). Next, we consider the (local) Cahn-Hilliard equation [ 2–4]
(see also [ 9,26]) with constant mobility
∂tφ= ∆(−∆φ+Ψ′(φ)) inΩ×(0,T), (1.18)
subject to the classical boundary and initial conditions
∂nφ=∂n∆φ= 0 on∂Ω×(0,T), φ(·,0) =φ0inΩ, (1.19)
whereΨis the Flory-Huggins potential deﬁned by

The separation property ( 1.8) for ( 1.18)-(1.19) was ﬁrst established in [ 7] and [ 25] in one and two dimen-
sions, respectively. The argument has been subsequently si mpliﬁed in [ 19] and [ 20]. More recently, it
was extended to a more general class of potential in [ 14]. In three dimensions, the separation property has
been shown only in [ 1] on the time interval [Ts,∞), whereTscannot be computed explicitly (see also [ 23]ON THE NONLOCAL CAHN-HILLIARD EQUATION IN THREE DIMENSIONS 5
for a class of singular potentials different from ( 1.20)). However, it still remains a major challenge to
demonstrate the separation property for ( 1.18)-(1.19) for all positive times in three dimensions. Finally, we
mention some recent results regarding the nonlocal-to-loc al asymptotics obtained in [ 5,6,16], That is, the
weak solution to the nonlocal Cahn-Hillliard equation conv erges to the weak solution of the local Cahn-
Hilliard equation, under suitable conditions on the data of the problem and a rescaling of the interaction
kernelJ.
2. S EPARATION PROPERTY AND H¨OLDER REGULARITY
In this section we provide an improved proof of the separatio n property for the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard
equation in three dimensional domains. Then, we derive some consequences on the regularity of the solu-
tion.
Let us ﬁrst recall the following well known result.
Lemma 2.1. Let{yn}n∈N0⊂R+satisfy the relation

for someC >0,b >1andǫ >0. Assume that y0≤C−1

yn≤y0b−n
ǫ,∀n≥1.
In particular, yn→0asn→ ∞ .
Proof of Theorem 1.2.Let us report the well-posedness results from [ 13, Theorems 3.4 and 4.1]: there
exists a unique weak solution φ: Ω×[0,∞)→Rto the system ( 1.2)-(1.3) satisfying
φ∈L∞(Ω×(0,∞)) :|φ(x,t)|<1a.e. inΩ,∀t >0,

where the positive constant C0only depends on ENL(φ0),φ0,Ωand the parameters of the system. The
positive constant C1(τ)also depends on the same quantities as C0, in addition to τ. Furthermore, the
constants C0andC1are uniformly bounded in φ0ifφ0lies in a compact set of (−1,1).
In the ﬁrst part of the proof, we show the separation property (1.11). To this end, we now introduce the
iteration scheme ` a la De Giorgi devised in [ 14, Section 4]. Let τ >0be ﬁxed. We consider three positive6 ON THE NONLOCAL CAHN-HILLIARD EQUATION IN THREE DIMENSION S

precise value of /tildewideτandδwill be chosen afterwards. We deﬁne two sequences

Notice that
t−1< tn< tn+1< T−/tildewideτ,∀n≥0,such that tn→t−1+2/tildewideτ=T−/tildewideτasn→ ∞, (2.8)
and
1−2δ≤kn< kn+1<1−δ,∀n≥0,such that kn→1−δasn→ ∞. (2.9)
Forn≥0, we introduce ηn∈C1(R)such that
ηn(t) =/braceleftBigg

/tildewideτ. (2.10)
Next, for n≥0, we consider the function
φn(x,t) = max{φ(x,t)−kn,0}= (φ−kn)+.
Consequently, we introduce the sets
In= [tn−1,T]andAn(t) ={x∈Ω :φ(x,t)−kn≥0},∀t∈In.
Ift∈[0,tn−1), we setAn(t) =∅. We observe that we have
In+1⊆In,∀n≥0, I n→[T−/tildewideτ,T]asn→ ∞, (2.11)
and
An+1(t)⊆An(t),∀n≥0, t∈In+1. (2.12)
The last ingredient is

SinceF′(φ)∈L∞(τ,∞;H1(Ω)) and|{x∈Ω :|φ(x,t)|= 1}|= 0for allt≥τ, we deduce from [ 24] that
hk(F′(φ))∈L∞(τ,∞;H1(Ω)∩L∞(Ω)), where
hk:R→R, hk(s) =

Then, it follows that hk(F′(φ))→F′(φ)almost everywhere in Ωand for all t≥τ, and∇(hk(F′(φ))) =
F′′(φ)∇φ1{|F′(φ)|<k}(·)→F′′(φ)∇φalmost everywhere in Ωand for all t≥τ. Thus, by the monotone

for allt≥τ. As consequence, it is easily seen that ∇F′(φ) =F′′(φ)∇φin distributional sense. Thanks to
this, we rewrite ( 2.13) as

This is actually a correction of the argument in [ 13] and [ 28] where/ba∇dbl∇J/ba∇dblL1(Ω)appears in the estimate
analogous to the one above, instead of /ba∇dbl∇J/ba∇dblL1(BM1). In order to handle the term I2, we recall the main
observation in [ 28]:

We are left to show that ( 2.22) is satisﬁed. Recalling ( A3), (2.5) andy0=/integraltextT

Now, set T=τ+/tildewideτ
2. Up to eventually reducing δto get/tildewideτeven smaller, we clearly have τ−5/tildewideτ
2≥τ
2.
Therefore, by ( 2.23), we deduce that /ba∇dbl(φ−(1−δ))+/ba∇dblL∞(Ω×(τ−/tildewideτ
2,τ+/tildewideτ
2))= 0. We point out that the value of
/tildewideτis independent of the choice of T. Thus, repeating the same argument on intervals of size /tildewideτ, we conclude
that/ba∇dbl(φ−(1−δ))+/ba∇dblL∞(Ω×(τ−/tildewideτ
2,∞)= 0. Finally, repeating the same argument for (φ+ (−1 +δ))−, we
arrive at the desired conclusion ( 1.11). It is important to highlight that the value of δonly depends on F,J,
Ω,ENL(φ0)andτ.
The rest of the proof is devoted to the additional regularity results ( 1.12) and ( 1.13) that can be inferred
once the separation property is established. Firstly, by de ﬁnition of µin (1.2), we observe that
sup
t≥τ/ba∇dblµ(t)/ba∇dblL∞≤sup
t≥τ/parenleftbig
/ba∇dblF′(φ(t))/ba∇dblL∞(Ω)+/ba∇dblJ∗φ(t)/ba∇dblL∞(Ω)/parenrightbig

Let us observe that

−J∗∂h
tφ(·),0< t≤T−h. (2.27)
By ( 1.11),/ba∇dblsφ(·+h) + (1−s)φ(·)/ba∇dblL∞(Ω×(τ,∞))≤1−δfor alls∈(0,1). Then, exploiting that
/ba∇dbl∂h
tφ/ba∇dblL2(0,T−h;L2(Ω))≤ /ba∇dbl∂tφ/ba∇dblL2(0,T;L2(Ω)), we infer from ( 2.4) thatsupt≥τ/ba∇dbl∂h
tµ/ba∇dblL2(t,t+1;L2(Ω))≤C2,where
C2>0depends on C0,τ,δandJ, but is independent of h, . This implies that ∂tµ∈L2(0,T;L2(Ω)) for
anyT >0, andsupt≥τ/ba∇dbl∂tµ/ba∇dblL2(t,t+1;L2(Ω)≤C2.
Secondly, we study the H¨ older continuity in both time and sp ace. We notice that ( 1.1) is a quasi-
linear equation with principal part in divergence form. Fol lowing the notation in the book [ 21], we deﬁne
al(x,t,u,p) =/tildewideF′′(u)pl−(∂lJ∗φ(·,t))(x), where/tildewideFis the restriction of Fin[−1+δ,1−δ]. In light of
the convexity of Fand|/tildewideF′′(s)| ≤ |F′′(1−δ)|, for alls∈[−1+δ,1−δ], we deduce that
al(x,t,u,p)pl≥θ
2|p|2−1
2θ/ba∇dbl∇J/ba∇dblL1(BM1),|al(x,t,u,p)| ≤ |F′′(1−δ)||p|+/ba∇dbl∇J/ba∇dblL1(BM1).
We also note that the solution φsatisfying ( 2.1)-(2.6) is a bounded generalized solution in the sense of [ 21,
Chapter V]. Thus, by [ 21, Theorem 1.1, Chapter V], we deduce that ( 1.13) holds in Ω′×[t,t+ 1] , for
anyt≥τandΩ′⊂Ωseparated from ∂Ω. In order to achieve ( 1.13) up to the boundary, we makeON THE NONLOCAL CAHN-HILLIARD EQUATION IN THREE DIMENSIONS 11
use of [ 8, Corollary 4.2], which provides the desired conclusion und er the same assumptions. It is worth
noticing that the constant C3and the parameter αfrom both [ 21] and [ 8] only depends on δ,θ,/ba∇dbl∇J/ba∇dblL1(BM1)
andΩ. This completes the proof. /square
3. O N THE REGULARITY OF THE GLOBAL ATTRACTOR
This section is devoted to some regularity properties of the global attractor Amfor the dynamical system
(Hm,S(t))stated in Theorem 1.4.
Proof of Theorem 1.4.Let us consider φ⋆∈ Am. It is clear that /ba∇dblφ⋆/ba∇dblL∞(Ω)≤1such|φ⋆| ≤1−m
and/ba∇dblφ⋆/ba∇dblH1(Ω)≤N1, whereN1is a universal constant (namely, it does not depend on φ⋆). We observe
that|ENL(φ⋆)| ≤N2, whereN2is a universal constant depending only on /ba∇dblJ/ba∇dblL1(BM1)(cf. ( 2.14)) and
maxs∈[−1,1]|F(s)|. Then, applying Theorem 1.2, we deduce that
/ba∇dblS(t)φ⋆/ba∇dblL∞(Ω)≤1−δ,∀t≥[1,∞). (3.28)
Here,δdepends on the constants in ( 2.26). In particular, since |φ⋆| ≤1−m, it is easily seen that
C(ENL(φ⋆),1)≤N3, whereN3is a universal constant. This implies that δis a universal constant. Thanks
to the arbitrary of φ⋆in the above argument, we deduce that
Am=S(1)Am⊂BL∞(Ω)(0,1−δ).
Next, by the second part of Theorem 1.2, we infer from ( 1.13) and ( 1.14) that
/ba∇dblS(t)φ⋆/ba∇dblCα(Ω)=/ba∇dblS(t)φ⋆/ba∇dblC(Ω)+ sup
x,y∈Ω,x/ne}ationslash=y|(S(t)φ⋆)(x)−(S(t)φ⋆)(y)|
|x−y|α≤1−δ+C3=:N4.
Notice that N4is a universal constant which depends only on N2,δ,mand the parameters of the system
(namely, F,J,Ω). Thus, since the constant are independent of φ⋆, we conclude that Am=S(1)Am⊂
BCα(Ω)(0,N4). The proof is complete. /square
