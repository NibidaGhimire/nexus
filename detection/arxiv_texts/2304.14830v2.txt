We derive a theory of quantum gravity containing an AdS 3isometry/qubit duality. The theory is
basedonasuperalgebrageneralizationoftheenvelopingalgebraofthehomogeneousAdS 3spacetime
isometry group and is isomorphic to the complexified octonion algebra through canonical quantiza-
tion. Its first three quaternion generators correspond to an ℏ-quantized AdS 3embedded spacetime
and its remaining four non-quaternion generators to a G-quantized embedding 2 + 2Minkowski
spacetime. The quaternion algebra’s expression after a monomorphism into the complexified Clif-
fordalgebraproducesatwo-dimensionalconformaloperatorproductexpansionwithacentralcharge
anomaly, which results in an area-law ℏGscaling satisfying the holographic principle and defines
an “arrow of time”. This relationship allows us to extend the theory through supersymmetry- and
conformal-breaking O(G)transformations of the embedding to produce perturbed AdS 3spacetimes
and derive a resolution to the black hole information paradox with an explicit mechanism.
The relationship between general relativity and quan-
tum theory has benefited recently from the study of
the correspondence between anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-
time and conformal field theories (CFTs) [1–3] and par-
ticularly promising results have been found regarding
the thermodynamic and entropic properties of black
holes [4–6]. This correspondence elegantly encapsulates
the holographic principle, wherein the properties of a
larger dimensional bulk geometry are encoded in a lower-
dimensional field theory that resides on its boundary [6–
11].

correspondence. b) The embedding and embedded space
for the AdS 3isometry/qubit correspondence. In the con-
jectured AdS 3/CFT 2correspondence, the AdS 3bulk space-
time asymptotes to a Minkowski spacetime. Therein, the
Minkowski spacetime inherits the AdS 3SO(2,2)isometry
group of the bulk and corresponds to a conformal field the-
ory symmetric under SO (2,2). The correspondence is exact
at this asymptotic boundary, where it is equivalent to em-
bedding a hyperboloid onto a larger-dimensional Minkowski
embedding spacetime that inherits its isometries and defines
an AdS 3embedded spacetime. The latter is the setting for
the algebraic AdS 3isometry group/qubit correspondence pre-
sented here.
AdS/CFT dualities are based on approximate postu-
lates that form a sort of “dictionary” [12–17]. Here we
present a quantum gravity theory with an AdS 3isom-
etry group/qubit duality that produces a very simi-
lar dictionary but instead depends on relations betweenfinitely-many Lie superalgebra generators corresponding
to spacetime and spin quantized degrees of freedom (see
Figure 1). This is a supersymmetric (SUSY) extended
modelproducedbyconsideringtheembeddingofaspace-
time in one of higher dimension [18–20]. It is also a su-
peralgebrageneralizationofacanonical(anti-)commuta-
tion relation (CAR/CCR) algebra using the complexified
Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(C), which provides a basis-free for-
mulation of the commutation relations of the indefinite
special orthogonal Lie groups SO (n, m)and the canoni-
cal qubit anticommutation relations. This proves to be
a natural way to link the geometric covariant formula-
tion of general relativity to a similar basis-independent
formulation of quantum mechanics.
Our results can be summarized into the finding that
the quaternion subalgebra of the octonion algebra emer-
gently defines an AdS 3spacetime on an embedding space
and that a perturbed AdS 3spacetime can be derived as
anO(G)transformation of this embedding space.
We offer a short technical summary highlighting our
particular contributions in Section A for the benefit of
readers well-versed with Clifford algebras and would like
to quickly evaluate how our results compare to prior
work.

oftherelationshipsbetweentheseCliffordalgebras. Note
that there is really only one unique Clifford algebra in
most of this construction since all are either isomorphic
to the Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(R)or its complexification.
More specifically, in Section B we introduce the
SL(2,R)symmetry group that covers the symmetry
group of non-unitary qubit quantum mechanics and the
AdS 3isometry group, SO+(2,2)/SO+(1,2), in terms of
the basis elements of the complexified quaternion algebra
H⊗C. In the Sections C we establish an monomorphism
from the Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(C)toH⊗C∼=Cl3,0(R)
that is dependent on a dimensionless constant ℏWe de-
rive how to relate the elements of Cl 3,0(C)under this
monomorphism by orders of ℏand define the associated
Lagrangians and expectation values in this Clifford al-
gebra that are equivalent to their quantum mechanical
analogs. In Section D we derive an operator product ex-
pansion (OPE) in Cl 3,0(C)that is isomorphic to multipli-
cation in the quaternion algebra. We show how express-
ingthisinCl 3,0(C)afterthe ℏ-dependentmonomorphism
makes this OPE equivalent to the commutation relations
of the Virasoro algebra, i.e. the OPE is conformal and ex-
hibits the expected central charge anomaly dependent on
ℏ. In Section E, we formally establish how this Clifford
algebra respects conformal symmetry in its complexified
Clifford algebra.
InSection Fweintroducetheoctonionalgebraasasu-
persymmetric G-extension of the ℏ-quantized quaternion
algebra. We define the monomorphism from Cl 2,0(C)∼=

3,0(R)subalgebra of Cl[0]
4,0(C)to Cl[0]
4,0(C). This al-
lows us to define a dual operator product expansion in
this larger Cl 4,0(C)algebra. In Section G we show how
the holographic principle is present in the octonion the-
ory. In Section H we summarize the “dictionary” of the
AdS 3/qubit correspondence.
This isomorphic dual super-subalgebra allows us to
find that the central charge anomaly necessarily intro-
duces eternal large black holes in AdS 3through Killing
horizons and singularities. Upon Wick rotation into
imaginary time to produce a dual AdS Euclidean space-
time, the thermal AdS state becomes a Euclidean BTZ
black hole. We also show that the octonion theory sat-isfies the property that large thermodynamically stable
black holes in AdS 3are eternal and relate it to the renor-
malized subalgebra’s complete description at O(G0).
In Section I we derive a perturbed AdS 3spacetime
through a O(G)perturbative transformation of the oc-
tonion algebra. In Section J we extend this to derive
the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for AdS 3and the perturbed
AdS 3spacetime. In Section K we discuss how evolution
in the dual formalism is irreversible when the RG flow is
takenintoaccount, effectivelydefiningan“arrowoftime”.
We discuss more general properties of the full theory in
Section L.
In this part we link radiative black holes with O(G)
perturbations of homogeneous curved spacetime. Prior
constructions have required a bath-coupling at the CFT
boundary [21, 22] to render eternal AdS black holes evap-
orative. This added construct in prior efforts can lead to
uncertainty in its interpretation [23–26]. The O(G)per-
turbation of the embedding spaced requires no such cou-
pling and allows for an explicit derivation of a mechanism
for the turnaround of the Page curve, thereby providing
a mechanistic resolution of the black hole information
paradox. In particular, we show that Hawking pair pro-
duction at the event horizon must be accompanied by
wormhole creation along perpendicular isometries.
This approach also allows us to formally justify the
maximin principle used to define quantum extremal sur-
faces when calculating RT surfaces. We show that as
evaporation proceeds along the Page time the quantum
extremal surfaces transition to higher-dimensional sur-
faces that loop progressively more times around singu-
larities. We accomplish this by relating the Page time to
the magnitude of the evaporating holographic area. This
allowsustouniquelydefinewhichorderinasemiclassical
Gℏexpansion duality is dominant, equivalent to critical
points in the associated RG flow. Since RG flow is irre-
versible in two-dimensions, this also specifies an “arrow
of time”.

A. Technical Summary
We present here a technical high-level summary of the
results presented in this paper, highlighting the novel
contributions that we make, which we roughly organize
into seven results.
We begin by generating the universal cover SL (2,R)
of SO+(2,2)in the usual manner, with a mix of even
and odd Grassmann elements of the Clifford algebra (the
Pauli algebra) Cl 3,0(R),ξ1,ξ2,ξ1ξ2, expressed in the
larger complexified Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(C). We con-
sider the complexified algebra because it also contains
the Witt algebra generators that are closely related to
the conformal symmetry group. Therefore, we consider a3

FIG. 3. The qubit quaternion theory can be expressed in
Cl3,0(C)with three Grassmann generators through an ℏ-
dependent monomorphism to the Pauli algebra Cl 3,0(R)iso-
morphic to the complexified quaternions. This is a confor-
mal theory when expressed in Cl 3,0(C)since it contains the
Witt algebra and the monomorphism centrally extends it to
the Virasoro algebra. This monomorphism is defined by ℏ-
quantization that produces a conformal operator product ex-
pansion (OPE), which when expressed in Cl 3,0(C)produces
anO(ℏ0)and conformal anomaly O(ℏ1)term, where ℏis
proportional to the central charge. This also defines an ir-
reversible two-dimensional renormalization group (RG) flow,
whereℏplays the role of running coupling. This means that
OPEs are dominated by their O(ℏ0)term in early evolution
andO(ℏ1)term in later evolution, defining an evolution “di-
rection”. The Pauli algebra is isomorphic to Cl 2,0(C), which
when expressed as a subalgebra of Cl[0]
4,0(C), produces a dual
algebra that is a universal cover of the AdS 3isometry group.
This is defined through a G-dependent monomorphism from
Cl[0]
4,0(C)to Cl 2,0(C)that allows the conformal OPE to be
equivalently expressed in terms of O(G−1)andO(G0)terms.
The direct sum of the Cl[0]
3,0(C)and dual Cl 2,0(C)algebras
contain the complexified octonion algebra. An O(G)trans-
formation can extend Cl 2,0(C)to the full Cl[0]
4,0(C)algebra.

cluded. These basis elements of H⊗Care the quantized
Grassmann generators we denote {ˆξi}3
i=1with non-zero
anticommutator we define to be the dimensionless con-
stantℏ. Since H⊗Chas a non-zero anticommutator
proportional to ℏ, the isomorphism relates the even and
odd terms of Cl 3,0(R)(and thus Cl 3,0(C)after complex-
ification) by powers of ℏand allows us to show that a
conformal operator product expansion (OPE) of this al-
gebra can be written in Cl 3,0(C)equivalent to the prod-
uct of the H⊗Calgebra. This OPE produces a finite
series with an O(ℏ0)andO(ℏ1)term (see Eq. 108). We
identify ℏ/2as the central charge associated with the
algebra’s Casimir operator and show that the monomor-phismtoCl 3,0(R)producesanextensionoftheWittalge-
bra to the Virasoro algebra in Cl 3,0(C), where the O(ℏ1)
term is the central charge anomaly. This identifies ℏas
the running constant in an irreversible renormalization
group flow of the two-dimensional conformal symmetry
group SO+(2,2). See Figure 3 for a sketch of these mor-
phisms. We believe this relationship with ℏmarks the
firstnovelresultofthispaper, thoughsimilarresultshave
been found in other contexts [27].
SL(2,R)is also the universal cover of the homoge-
neous AdS 3isometry group. This can be shown by not-
ing that Cl 3,0(R)is also isomorphic to Cl 2,0(C), which
can be expressed as a subalgebra of Cl 4,0(C)to define a
non-associative extension of the three complexified ba-
sis elements of H⊗Cto four new elements ˆξµ=4,...,7,
ˆξ1=αˆξ4ˆξ5=αˆξ7ˆξ6,ˆξ2=αˆξ4ˆξ6=αˆξ5ˆξ7, and ˆξ3=
αˆξ4ˆξ7=αˆξ6ˆξ5. These elements have an anticommuta-
tor set to a new non-zero dimensionless constant, we de-
fine to be G. Taking into account the first commutator
relation for the H⊗Calgebra, this sets α=i√
2ℏ/G.
We show that these ˆξµˆξνcorrespond to the isometries of
AdS 3spacetime when written as a homogeneous sym-
metric space, which is symmetric under the quotient
group SO+(2,2)/SO+(1,2)and isomorphic to SL (2,R).
Considering the remaining algebraic multiplication rules,
iˆξµ=ˆξiˆξν, this identifies the ˆξµas the translations in the
embedding space, as has been found before in supersym-
metric extensions [18–20].
However, by restricting to the homogeneous symmet-
ric spacetime, we are further able to find that together
the elements {ˆξi}3
i=1and{ˆξµ}7
µ=4define the complexi-
fied octonion algebra, O⊗C. As far as we can find in
prior literature, this is the first time that this associa-
tion has been noticed and so we believe this marks the
second novel result of this paper. This insight proves
key to transforming this extension to spacetimes with
non-negative curvature while preserving the property of
a norm. [Moreover, as we shall show, the quotient struc-
ture of the symmetric spacetimes reduces the number of
asymptotically timelike Killing vectors to one, which al-
lows for a well-defined time-conjugate energy and thus
stress-energy tensor.]
By showing that ℏcan be interpreted as a dimension-
less Planck’s constant due to a relationship between con-
textuality and classical integrable probability theories,
we are then able to show that this larger octonion Lie
superalgebra’s nested anti-commutation relations satisfy
the two-dimensional holographic principle if Gis inter-
preted as a dimensionless gravitational constant. This
marks the third novel result of this paper.
We can then define an expansion in the Cl 2,0(C)sub-
algebra of Cl[0]
4,0(C)in terms of only the dual constant
Gthat is isomorphic to the ℏ-dependent monomorphism
from Cl 3,0(C)that we defined before (see Eq. 166). This
transforms the O(ℏ0)andO(ℏ1)terms in Cl 3,0(C)’s op-
erator product expansion to O(G0)andO(G1), respec-
tively. This is the fourth novel result of this paper.4
Using this dual to the operator product expansion, we
can find the dual of entanglement entropies in terms of
the subalgebra Cl[0]
4,0(C)(see Eq. 212). We obtain agree-
ment with the Ryu-Takayanagi generalized formula and
Page curve for AdS 3black holes with an explicit mecha-
nism for the turn-around based on wormhole formation.
We show that states in the dual subalgebra can be asso-
ciated with symplectic areas defined by isometry group
elements, which allows us to show that new quantum ex-
tremal surfaces are associated with each term of the dual
operator product expansion. This is the fifth novel result
of this paper.
We then proceed to show that, when considering the
full octonion algebra, O(G)transformations on the ˆξµ
produce isometries that define a perturbed AdS 3space-
time. This extends the dual algebra from Cl[0]
4,0(C)to
Cl4,0(C)and adds a third O(G1)term to the dual op-
erator product expansion. This is the sixth novel result
of this paper and ultimately allows us to derive our final
novel result: a mechanistic resolution to the blackhole
information paradox.
B. SL (2,R)Symmetry in the Octonions
We begin by briefly reviewing unitary qubit quantum
mechanics, which is generally more familiar compared to
the non-unitary quantum theory. Unitary qubit quan-
tum mechanics is defined within SU (2). An important
rotation group is doubly covered by this unitary qubit
group:
SU(2)≈SO(3), (1)
where ≈denotes a surjective homomorphism (i.e. a dou-
ble cover).
This can be shown by identifying real-valued linear
combinations of the Wick rotated quaternions of unit
norm (i.e. multiplied by i) as a parameterization of
SU(2):
ˆg=X0ˆξ0+iX1ˆξ1+iX2ˆξ2+iX3ˆξ3 (2)

, (3)
where

2+X2
3= 1, (4)
Xi∈R, and (ˆξ1,ˆξ2,ˆξ3)≡(ˆσx,ˆσz,ˆσy)are the Pauli oper-
ators.
Eq. 4 is a restriction on a four-dimensional embed-
ding space with metric signature (++++) to a three-
dimensional embedded manifold (a sphere).
We can now identify R3with the span of {ˆξi}3
i=1, and
show that v∈R3is rotated around X≡(X1, X2, X3)
with angle 2θ, where cosθ=X0and|sinθ|=XTX, by
ˆgvˆg−1= (−ˆg)v(−ˆg)−1∈R3. (5)Complexification of the corresponding algebra su(2)
produces sl(2,C)and reveals that the universal cover of
this space is spanned by the basis
ˆT3=−i
2ˆξ2, (6)
ˆT±=1
2(ˆξ1±iˆξ3). (7)
This produces the Casimir operator
ˆC2=ˆT+ˆT−+ˆT2
3−T3. (8)
Invariance under a Casimir operator (whose highest-
weight eigenvalue is called the central charge) is the main
property of conformal field theories that exhibit space-
time duals. However, such a spacetime duality requires
the Casimir operator to correspond to a symmetry group
that is non-Euclidean (i.e. its metric signature cannot
have the same signs like (+ + +) for SO (3)).
We can obtain such a non-Euclidean space with spin-
1/2qubits by noting that a non-unitary subspace can be
defined on their Hilbert space by Wick rotating only two
of their basis elements.
In particular, replacing iˆσxandiˆσzwith ˆσxandˆσz,
respectively, produces
SL(2,R)∼=SL(2,R)×SL(2,R)
SL(2,R)(9)

∼=SO+(1,2)×SO+(1,2)

where
SL(2,R)≡ {A∈GL(2) : det A= 1}.(12)
This relationship can be proven by verifying the fol-
lowing correspondence between group elements:

where
(Kij)kl=δikδjl+δilδjk (16)5
are boosts on a spacetime with metric signature (−+−+)
and
(Jij)kl=ϵij(δikδjl+δilδjk) (17)
are rotations on the same spacetime [18].
The Lorentz group SO+(2,2)/SO+(1,2)is the homo-
geneous symmetry group of AdS 3spacetime without par-
ity or time reversal [28]. The same correspondence can
be found by cyclically permuting the ˆξiw.r.t. the coeffi-
cient i. Therefore, Eqs. 13-15 mean that the algebra de-
fined by a non-normalized (spin- 1/2) qubit on a Hilbert
space contains three overlapping universal covers of AdS 3
spacetime.
Spin(3)is defined to be the three even elements
Cl[0]
3,0(R)of the Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(R)(defined in Sec-
tion C). These are the three generators of the four-
dimensional quaternion algebra, H:{iˆξ1, iˆξ2, iˆξ3}. The
odd elements of Cl 3,0(R)do not form a subalgebra. The
generators of the one-dimensional real algebra Rand
the two-dimensional complex algebra Ccan be simi-
larly shown to be the even elements of Cl 1,0(R)and
Cl2,0(R), respectively. Considering larger Clifford alge-
bras Cl n,0(R)reveals that the only remaining normed
division algebra must have eight dimensions [29, 30].
Thus, these three Clifford subalgebras, Cl[0]
1,0(R),
Cl[0]
2,0(R)andCl[0]
3,0(R), canbeassociatedwiththenormed
division algebras R,CandH. The same association does
not hold for the largest eight dimensional normed alge-
bra, but we shall see its corresponding lower dimensional
Clifford algebra, Cl 3,0(R), can still be used to build it in
a different manner after complexification.
Identifying iˆξ3≡ˆξ1ˆξ2, it is clear from Eqs. 13-15 that a
mix of even and odd elements of Cl 3,0(C)form the group
SL(2,R):{ˆξ0≡ˆI2,ˆξ1,ˆξ2,ˆξ1ˆξ2}. Since these possess an
irreducible direct sum representation given by Eqs 13-
15, it is possible to construct a larger normed algebra by
introducing four new elements ˆξ4,ˆξ5,ˆξ6, and ˆξ7, where
ˆξ2
µ= 1, and non-associatively equate them (with pro-
portionality constants ±1and−i) to these irreducible
elements of SL (2,R):
−iK01=ˆξ4ˆξ5 (18)
−iK32=ˆξ7ˆξ6 (19)
−iK21=ˆξ6ˆξ5 (20)
−iK03=ˆξ4ˆξ7 (21)
J02=ˆξ4ˆξ6 (22)
−J13=ˆξ5ˆξ7. (23)
This is equivalent to assigning the multiplication rules
−iˆξ1=

spanned by the ith and jth elements. We will drop
this notation and have the subspace implied by the bare
equality henceforth.
By construction, these inherit a norm and (thus in-
verses) from the norm of the elements on the left-hand-
side (which as we stated before, are elements of the
normed algebra Cl[0]
3,0(R)∼=H). For example,

where in line 27 we used Eq. 24, in line 28 we used Eq. 25,
and in line 31 we used Eq. 26 (in between we also used
thealternate property of these non-associative elements:
(ˆξiˆξj)ˆξρ=−ˆξi(ˆξjˆξρ)). In this manner the norm is depen-
dent on the fullirreducible direct sum structure of the
multiplication rules assigned in Eq. 24-26. All remaining
multiplication rules in this normed algebra can be found
from these:
iˆξ4=ˆξ1ˆξ5=ˆξ2ˆξ6=ˆξ3ˆξ7, (34)
iˆξ5=ˆξ4ˆξ1=ˆξ2ˆξ7=ˆξ6ˆξ3, (35)
iˆξ6=ˆξ7ˆξ1=ˆξ4ˆξ2=ˆξ3ˆξ5, (36)
iˆξ7=ˆξ1ˆξ6=ˆξ5ˆξ2=ˆξ4ˆξ3. (37)
Taking into account the imaginary constants in Eqs. 18-
21 that relate these to the spacetime, it follows that
−(iˆξ4)2=−(iˆξ6)2=ˆξ2
5=ˆξ2
7= 1andwewillseethatthis
defines the metric signature (−+−+)of the embedding
space.
The resulting algebra can be identified as the complex-
ified octonion algebra O.
It is perhaps not surprising that such a construction
cannot be iterated once more since these elements can
be found to contain no new irreducible subgroups; the
octonionalgebra Oisthelargestnormedalgebrapossible.
Wehavethusseenthatthecorrespondinglowerdimen-
sional Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(R)of the octonion algebra O
can still be used to construct it, but this requires an asso-
ciation to both its even and odd complexified elements.
Specifically, Eqs. 24-26 define Cl[0]
2,0(C)(as can be seen
by noting that ξ1,ξ2andξ1ξ2are sufficient to define the
equalities), which is isomorphic to Cl 3,0(R).
As we noted before, representations of the algebra
sl(2,C)producesoperatorswhichpossessweightsandare
invariant under a Casimir operator. sl(2,C)is also the
universal enveloping algebra of SL (2,R), and so can be
used to produce its representation too.6

tion on a four-dimensional embedding space with met-
ric signature (+−+−)to a three-dimensional embedded
manifold (a hyperboloid) (see Figure 1b).
Complexification of its algebra produces sl(2,C)and
reveals that the universal cover of this three-dimensional
hyperboloid is spanned by the basis [31]
ˆT3=−i
2ˆξ3, (41)
ˆT±=1
2(ˆξ2±iˆξ1). (42)
This produces the Casimir operator
ˆC2=1
2(ˆT+ˆT−+ˆT−ˆT+)−ˆT2
3. (43)
In this sense, there is a correspondence between every
two-dimensional qubit’s associated conformal symmetry
group and three-dimensional AdS spacetime’s symmetry
group. Applying these relationships to continuous field
theories with actions that are invariant under SL (2,R)
and with metrics d s2=−dX2
−1−dX2
0+dX2

produces the AdS 3/CFT 2correspondence. One such ex-
ample is the bosonic string theory on AdS 3×Mand the
SL(2,R)WZW model [31], where Mis compact.
This exposition reveals that the symmetry group
SL(2,R)underlying the AdS 3/CFT 2correspondence is
inherently part of the octonion algebra O;SL(2,R)de-
fines the multiplication rules of the octonion algebra’s
quaternion algebra generators and also of the remaining
non-quaternion generators. The former define (generally
non-pure) qubit quantum mechanics and the latter define
the isometries of an AdS 3spacetime. In this sense, we
call this an AdS 3/qubit correspondence.
We will use this observation in the following to develop
a representation of qubit quantum mechanics through a
Majorana-to-qubit mapping that produces a monomor-
phism from the complexified Clifford algebra, Cl 3,0(C)
(the complexified Pauli algebra), to the complexified
quaternion algebra, Cl[0]
3,0(C)∼=H. Working with the
larger complexified Clifford algebra instead of directly
with the quaternions will allow us to define operator
product expansions similar to those in conformal field
theory. This will allow us to derive an isomorphism to
a dual algebra after we extend this algebra by four gen-
erators to produce the octonion algebra. The operatorproduct expansion in the dual algebra proves key in de-
riving many of the gravitational results here, as well as
the further extension to a perturbed anti-de Sitter space-
time. The differing contextuality or conformal anomaly
of the two-dimensional field theory compared to the full
octonion theory will also guide us on how quantization
related subsets of elements in this algebra.
C. The Clifford Algebra Cl 3,0(C)
This section reviews the basics of interest to us of su-
peralgebra generalizations of CCR/CAR algebras.
We begin with a definition of the Clifford algebra
Cln,0(K)over the field K:
Definition 1 (Clifford algebra Cl n,0(K))We define
the Clifford algebra Cl n,0(K)to be an associative algebra
over the field Kwith nGrassmann generators {ξi}n
i=1
that have an antisymmetric multiplication operation,
{ξi, ξj} ≡ξiξj−ξjξi= 0, (44)
called their anticommutator where i∈ {1, . . . , n }.
This subset of Clifford algebras are also called exterior
or Grassmann algebras. They are associative algebras,
which means that multiplication simply produces higher
order monomials. However, Eq. 44 implies that ξ2
i= 0
and so any monomial cannot have higher than quadratic
order in any particular generator. For ngenerators, this
means that the maximal monomial power is n.
In the following part of this section we will begin by
considering the Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(R), which is gener-
ated by three Grassmann generators.
Anyelement g∈Cl3,0(R)canberepresentedasafinite
sum of homogeneous monomials consisting of these three
generators:
g(ξ) =g0ξ0+3X
i=1giξi+3X
i,j=1gijξiξj+3X
i,j,k=1gijkξiξjξk,
(45)
where g0, gi, gij, gijk∈R.
Grassmann-valuedfieldsarecommonlyusedinfermion
quantum field theories where the number of their inde-
pendent modes is taken to be infinite and they are also
often paired into independent sets associated with a cre-
ationandannihilationoperators[32,33]. Instead, wewill
only use a single Grassmann algebra with three genera-
tors (per qubit).
See Appendix A for an introduction into Cl 3,0(R).
1. The Monomorphism from Cl 3,0(C)to the Complexified
Quaternion Algebra Cl[0]
3,0(C)
We can define an isomorphism from the Clifford al-
gebra Cl 3,0(R)to the complexified quaternion algebra7
H⊗C∼=Cl[0]
3,0(C)by quantizing the Clifford algebra
Cl3,0(R)in the usual manner by replacing its “Poisson
bracket” by an anti-commutator and setting it equal to
a non-zero (dimensionless) constant that we set to be ℏ:
iX
j 
ξk⃗∂
∂ξj! ⃗∂
∂ξjξl!
≡ {ξk, ξl}P.B.→ {ˆξk,ˆξl}=ℏδkl.
(46)
Thisproducesthecomplexifiedquaternionalgebra H⊗C.
At the moment, we do not mean to imply anything
physical by assigning ℏto be this dimensionless constant.
We will justify its interpretation as a dimensionless ana-
log to Planck’s constant in Appendix C5.
This anticommutation group structure means that the
ˆξiare proportional to the Pauli group elements (opera-
tors),
ˆξk=r
ℏ
2ˆσk, (47)
which obey
{ˆσk,ˆσl}= 2δkl. (48)
Thus we can make the identification: ˆξ1≡X,ˆξ2≡Z,
andˆξ3≡Y.
All these relations can be summarized with the usual
(rescaled) Pauli operator identity:
ˆξjˆξk=

ˆξj ifk= 0
ˆξk ifj= 0
δjkˆξ0−iϵjklˆξlotherwise .(49)
Therefore, this quantization simply transforms any el-
ement g(ξ)∈Cl3,0(R)given by Eq. 45 to
ˆg=g0ˆξ0+3X
i=1giˆξi+3X
i,j=1gijˆξiˆξj+3X
i,j,k=1gijkˆξiˆξjˆξk.(50)
This allows us to find a relationship between the even
and odd elements in the Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(R)and
even and odd powers in Hthat we can use to define this
isomorphism between Cl 3,0(R)andHwithout appealing
to quantization directly:
ˆξ0=i2
ℏˆξiˆξjˆξk, (51)
ˆξiˆξj=ir
ℏ
2ˆξk. (52)
In Cl 3,0(R), this can be equivalently expressed using
the Berezin calculus by defining the Grassmann Fourier
transform to be
˜g(ρ) =F(g(ξ)) =r
ℏ
2Z
ei√
2/ℏξ·ρg(ξ)d3ξ,(53)and its inverse to be
g(ξ) =F−1(˜g(ρ)) =r
2
ℏZ
e−i√
ℏ/2ξ·ρ˜g(ρ)d3ρ.(54)
˜g(ρ)∈Cl3,0(R)has the same form as g(ξ)as we have
defined it so far, namely
˜g(ρ) = ˜g0ρ0+3X
i=1˜giρi+3X
i,j=1˜gijρiρj+3X
i,j,k=1˜gijkρiρjρk.
(55)
The Grassmann Fourier transform relates the odd co-
efficients of ˜g(ρ)to the even coefficients of g(ξ)in the
following manner:
ip
ℏ/2˜g1=
F−1(g32−g23),(56)
ip
ℏ/2˜g2=
F−1(g13−g31),(57)
ip
ℏ/2˜g3=
F−1(g21−g12),(58)
˜g123−˜g132+ ˜g312
−˜g321+ ˜g231−˜g213=
F−1−iℏg0/2.(59)
Expressions for the even coefficients of ˜g(ρ)in terms of
the odd coefficients of g(ξ)can be found by removing
the tildes on the left-hand-side and adding them to the
right-hand-side.
This means that
F−1:Cl[1]
3,0(R)→iCl[0]
3,0(R). (60)
As a result, Cl3,0(R)can be shown to be isomorphic to
Cl[0]
3,0(C)by using the inverse of the Grassmann Fourier
transform F:
Cl3,0(R)≡Cl[0]
3,0(R)⊕Cl[1]
3,0(R) (61)
∼=Cl[0]
3,0(C)≡Cl[0]
3,0(R)⊕ F−1(Cl[1]
3,0(R))∼=H⊗C.(62)
Note that Cl[0]
3,0(C)forms a subalgebra while Cl[1]
3,0(C)
does not.
In other words, the Grassmann Fourier transform cap-
tureshowthecomplexifiedquaternionalgebra, consisting
of all products and sums of the Pauli matrices with coef-
ficients in C, is isomorphic to Cl 3,0(R). The real parts of
the linear combinations of Pauli operators correspond to
the odd monomials and the imaginary parts correspond
to the even monomials in the isomorphic Cl 3,0(R)alge-
bra.
Thismeansthatthereisnolossofinformationfromre-
stricting g(ξ)to consist solely of even-dimensional mono-
mials after complexification.
We proceed to define g(ξ)∈Cl[0]
3,0(C)instead of
Cl3,0(R):
g(ξ) =g0+ (g12ξ1ξ2+g23ξ2ξ3+g13ξ1ξ3(63)
+g21ξ2ξ1+g32ξ3ξ2+g31ξ3ξ1),
Applying the Grassmann Fourier transform to this ele-
ment now defines a redundant element consisting solely8
of odd monomials with complex coefficients, ˜g(ρ)∈
Cl[1]
3,0(C):
˜g(ρ) =˜g1ρ1+ ˜g2ρ2+ ˜g3ρ3
+ (˜g123ρ1ρ2ρ3+ ˜g132ρ1ρ3ρ2+ ˜g312ρ3ρ1ρ2(64)
+˜g321ρ3ρ2ρ1+ ˜g231ρ2ρ3ρ1+ ˜g213ρ2ρ1ρ3),
This can be used to define a further map from Cl[0]
3,0(C)
to Cl 3,0(C):
Cl[0]
3,0(C)ℏ>0,→Cl3,0(C)≡Cl[0]
3,0(C)⊕ F(Cl[0]
3,0(C)).(65)
Since ˜g∈Cl[1]
3,0(C)is redundant, this is an injective
map, i.e. a monomorphism. We note that since Fis
ℏ-dependent, this monomorphism is ℏ-dependent.
Even elements are sometimes called Weyl elements in
other literature due to the historical development of this
algebra in the Wigner-Weyl-Moyal formalism, where it
is related to a Wigner formulation of quantum mechan-
ics [34–36]. In the Fourier-sense, their dual elements
can be interpreted as the characteristic function of the
Weyl symbol, but are also the basis elements of the Clif-
ford algebra Cl 3,0(C). It is for this reason that this is
called a superalgebra generalization of a CCR/CAR al-
gebra in other literature [37] and can be related to C∗-
algebras [38, 39] an operator-algebraic formulation [40].
Yet another way to refer to the even elements g(ξ)∈
Cl[0]
3,0(C)and the odd elements ˜g(ρ)∈Cl[1]
3,0(C), is as
the Bosonic and Fermionic superpartners with respect
to a supersymmetry algebra. Cl 3,0(C)is a Lie superal-
gebra and therefore defines such an algebra. The even
elements commute with each other and the odd elements
anti-commute. As we shall see, this turns out to be a
supersymmetric embedding space [18–20].
Note that the supersymmetry present in the quater-
nionic algebra does not suggest that superpartners are
observable as meaningfully different particles when in-
terpreted in quantum mechanics. As we have seen in
Eqs. 56-59, the superpartners simply correspond to anti-
symmetrized Wick rotations of the complexified quater-
nion algebra that makes up the (generally non-pure)
qubit Hilbert space. There is no real sense that these
are separate observable particles.
2. Symplectic Dynamics and Action
Any (unitary or non-unitary) qubit operation can be
decomposed into Paulis: UC=P3
i=0ciˆξiwhere ci∈C.
Thus
ˆξj→ˆUCˆξjˆU†
C (66)
=3X
k,l=0ckc∗
lˆξkˆξjˆξl (67)
=3X
k,l=0ckc∗
lℏϵjlnϵknmˆξm/2. (68)Since dequantization of an operator (not written as a
product of operators) simply involves removing the hats
from the ˆξiin any expression, it follows that the Grass-
mann version of Hamilton’s equation must be
dξk
dλ=ℏ
2{H, ξk}P.B.=iℏ
2H⃗∂
∂ξk. (69)
where the most general form for a one-particle Hamilto-
nian in this Grassmann algebra is
H(ξ) =−i
2X
k,l,mϵklmbkξlξm. (70)
Given our definition of involution from before, Hamilto-
nians are real-valued for unitaries, as expected.
This means that the equations of motion are
dξk
dλ=ℏ
2X
l,mϵklmblξm, (71)
which matches Eq. 68 when solved for a particular λ.
Note that we cannot strictly interpret the evolution pa-
rameter λto be time, since like ℏit is dimensionless.
The presence of a non-zero ℏcoefficient, when inter-
preted as Planck’s constant later, may be strange to see
in an equation that purports to be a Grassmann version
of Hamilton’s equations. However, as we have seen, it is
imposed by our quantization rule. We will soon see that
this is intimately related to why the classically efficiently
simulable unitary qubit Clifford stabilizer subtheory is
contextual.
Nevertheless, the ℏcanbefactoredoutwhentheevolu-
tion is solved for periods λthat produce only single terms
on the right-hand-side of Eq. 71 (i.e. evolutions that take
the Grassmann generators to themselves [41, 42]). In
this case, the ℏfactor can be effectively ignored as they
are not relative constants, and the evolution becomes
O(ℏ0). These evolutions turn out to be unitary Clifford
gates, which as we shall see are non-contextual [41] in
Appendix C3.
Hamilton’s equation is conventionally written in terms
of two conjugate degrees of freedom, xµandπµ:
dxµ
dλ=∂H
∂πµ,dπµ
dλ=−∂H
∂xµ. (72)
This implies that for the Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(C), the
Grassmann elements are conjugate under inversion: ξk≡
−ixk=iπk.
The Lagrangian, L, is related to the Hamiltonian,
L ≡X
µπµdxµ
dλ−H. (73)
This means that for Cl 3,0(C),
L=X
kξk 
H⃗∂
∂ξk!
−H. (74)9
Given the form of a general Hamiltonian (Eq. 70), this
implies that the Lagrangian is just the negative of the
Hamiltonian:
L=−iX
k,l,mϵklmblξkξm−H=i
2X
k,l,mϵklmbkξlξm=−H.
(75)
This means that Cl 3,0(C)exhibits symplectic dynam-
ics, which means that it preserves the “area” defined by
any pair of the threeconjugate degrees of freedom. The
two-form that defines this symplecticity is implicit in the
anti-commutation of the Grassmann generators or their
Poisson bracket, which as we saw, generates the Pauli
anti-commutation relation:
d
dλ{ξi, ξj}P.B.={˙ξi, ξj}P.B.+{ξi,˙ξj}P.B.= 0.(76)
See Appendix B for a derivation of the associated gen-
erating action of these Lagrangians.
3. Inner Products in Cl 3,0(C)Define the Qubit Hilbert
Space
In Section C1, we defined how to isomorphically
map between elements in Cl 3,0(R)and the complexi-
fied quaternion algebra H⊗C. We did this by quan-
tizing the algebraic elements by ℏand reconstructing an
equivalent procedure using the ℏ-dependent Grassmann
Fourier transform, which used Berezin calculus on the
Grassmann generators of the Clifford algebra.
In this section we will find that we can also impose
a Hilbert space inner product on the Clifford algebra
Cl3,0(R)(and thus its complexification) by similarly us-
ing the Berezin calculus. Instead of reconstructing an
equivalent procedure to the quantized Poisson bracket,
we will reconstruct an equivalent procedure to the trace
in Hilbert space using a free commutative product of the
quaternion algebra and the Clifford algebra,
ˆT(ρ) = exp
i3X
j=1ˆξjρj
∈H⊗C∗Cl3,0(R).(77)
We can use this as a map from Cl 3,0(C)to the quaternion
algebra by integrating out the Grassmann part of the free
commutative product.
This allows us to concisely define the quantized op-
erator ˆg(given by Eq. 50) to simply be the quantized
Grassmann Fourier transform of the element in Cl 3,0(C):
ˆg=Z
ˆT(ρ)˜g(ρ)d3ρ. (78)
This may seem like a lot more work than simply tak-
ing an element g∈Cl3,0(C)and adding hats to all of
Grassmann elements, but it turns out that ˆT(ρ)is group-
theoretically very useful for evaluating products of oper-
ators and concisely deriving many operations on Cl 3,0(C)
from their Hilbert space expressions.This is because ˆT(ρ)satisfies the properties of a trans-
lation operator:
ˆT(ρ′)ˆT(ρ′′) = exp
3X
j=1ρ′
jρ′′
j
ˆT(ρ′+ρ′′),(79)
and
TrˆT(ρ) = 2(1 + iδ(ρ)). (80)
Note that if gis defined to be in Cl[0]
3,0(R)and˜gin
Cl[1]
3,0(R), then the trace of ˆT(ρ)produces
Tr
ˆT(−ρ)ˆg
= 2(i˜g(ρ) +g(iρ)).(81)
This reflects the fact stated earlier that g(iρ)contains
the real coefficients while ˜g(ρ)contains their antisym-
metrized Wick rotation. The same identity holds after
complexification.
We can now see how the Hilbert space inner product
(i.e. traces) are expressed in terms of Grassmann inte-
grals. Using Eq. 78 and ˆT’s translation identities, expec-
tation values can be found to be [41]
[CHECK 2 pi hbar PREFACTORS BELOW!]
Tr(ˆOˆρ) =i
2πℏZ Z
ρ(ξ)e−iP

= (2πℏ)−1Z
ρ(ξ)˜O(ξ)d3ξ (83)
= (2πℏ)−1Z
O(ξ)˜ρ(ξ)d3ξ. (84)
Commonly,thestructureofaninnerproductorHilbert
space is imposed on a Grassmann algebra by defining
an even number 2kgenerators {ξi}k
i=1and{ξ∗

i=1, and
setting the inner product to be [32, 33]
Z Z
ξ1. . . ξ kξ∗
1. . . ξ∗
kdkξdkξ∗= 1.(85)
Since we are primarily considering the algebra Cl 3,0(C)
consisting of even and odd products of real-valued Grass-
manns (i.e. invariant under involution, whereas ξ∗
iisξi
under involution in Eq. 85), we see that Eq. 82 involves
both even elements and odd elements (i.e. Grassmann
Fourier transformed elements) in order to satisfy Eq. 85.
In particular, Eq. 82 satisfies the form of Eq. 85 if the
substitution iρk→ξ∗
kis made, which as we saw in Sec-
tion C1 is also how the Grassmann Fourier transform
maps between the even Cl[0]
3,0(C)elements and the odd
Cl[1]
3,0(C)elements. Therefore, this Hilbert space inner
productinvolvescomplexconjugationandanoveralldou-
ble integral over 2kvariables (where k= 3) as expected.
So for instance a density matrix corresponding to the
|0⟩⟨0|computation basis state, ˆρ=1
2(ˆI+ˆZ), has as-
sociated element ρ(ξ) =1

Again, using Eq. 78 and ˆT’s translation identities, the
element in Cl[0]

ˆO=ˆO1ˆO2can be found to be [41]

This will prove useful later on for when we semiclassically

subalgebra.
It also proves useful for defining correlation functions:
Tr(ˆO1ˆO2ˆρ) =Z

D. Operator Product Expansion in Cl 3,0(C)
In this section we will derive an operator product ex-
pansion (OPE). The OPE relates products of elements in
Cl3,0(C)to an exact truncating series [43] and will be de-
fined so that it is isomorphic to the ℏ-quantized product
in the quaternion algebra. We will show later in Sec-
tion E3 that this is a basis-independent formulation of
OPEs in continuous conformal field theories, which are
usually presented for holomorphic functions but here will
directly apply to the Cl 3,0(C)algebra elements itself.
Note that in the language of the Wigner-Weyl-Moyal
CARalgebra, theOPEiscalledtheGroenewoldrule[44].
1. Qubit Cl 3,0(C)Operator Product Expansion
We will indicate the the product of two elements in
Cl3,0(C)isomorphic to the product in the complexified
quaternion algebra by ⋆. It is clear right away that this
will likely involve the Berezin calculus and powers of ℏ
through Grassmann Fourier transforms; without supple-
menting with the Berezin calculus, the Grassmann prod-
uct in Cl 3,0(C)by itself will otherwise set all quadratic
products to zero.
Generally, for even elements
W1⋆ W2(ξ) =Z
e2
ℏ(ξ·ξ1+ξ2·ξ+ξ1·ξ2)W1(ξ1)W2(ξ2)d3ξ1d3ξ2.(89)This is the integral representation of this identity and
can be rewritten instead in terms of its odd elements:
W1⋆ W2(ξ) =Z
e2i
ℏ(ρ1·ξ+ρ2·ξ+ρ1·ρ2)fW1(ρ1)fW2(ρ2)d3ρ1d3ρ2.(90)
Now, following the similar treatment in [44] for the two-
generator formalism, we can define
′W1⋆ W2′(ξ1,ξ2)≡Z
e2i
ℏ(ρ1·ξ1+ρ2·ξ2+ρ1·ρ2)fW1(ρ1)fW2(ρ2)d3ρ1d3ρ2,(91)
such that′W1⋆ W2′(ξ,ξ) =W1⋆ W2(ξ).
This analytically continued function allows us to
obtain an expansion in orders of ℏby expanding
exp(2i
ℏρ1ρ2)and then setting ξ1=ξ2=ξ:

ξ1=ξ2=ξ.(95)
It is instructive to write out all three terms of the ℏex-
pansion:
W1⋆ W2(ξ)

Therefore, the O(ℏ0)termhandlesPaulitimesidentity,
theO(ℏ1)term handles Pauli times Pauli (not including
the identity), and the O(ℏ2)term handles Pauli squared
operations.
TheO(ℏ1)nature of Pauli times Pauli operation for
even Cl[0]
3,0(C)elements can also be seen by noting that
ˆξiˆξjˆξiˆξk=ℏˆξkˆξj/2. (98)11

Again, it is instructive to write out all three terms:

This shows how for the odd Cl[1]
3,0(C)elements, the
O(ℏ0)term still handles the Pauli times identity oper-
ations, but the two higher order terms are flipped in
their role compared to the OPE for the even Cl[0]
3,0(C)
elements: the O(ℏ1)term handles Pauli squared, and
theO(ℏ2)term handles Pauli times Pauli (not including
the identity).
TheO(ℏ)nature of Pauli squared operations for odd
elements can also be seen by noting that
ˆξiˆξi=ℏ
2. (107)
Note how the OPE expression for the even elements of
Cl3,0(C)(Eq.96)showhowtoreplacetheinsertionoftwo
“nearby” operators by a series of single “local” operators,
where by this we mean that two operators defined on two
separate algebras spanned by ξ1andξ2are expressed bya series of single operators evaluated on a single algebra
spanned by ξ. This interpretation does not strictly hold
for the odd expansion (Eq. 105) since the overall Fourier
transform on the terms in that series require a “global
definite” integration. Thisisanothermanifestationofthe
subalgebrapropertyoftheevenelementscomparedtothe
odd elements. Strictly speaking, this means that only the
expansion for Cl[0]
3,0(C)is a proper OPE in the conformal
theory sense. We formally show this more precisely in
Section E.
This shows how restricting to the isomorphic complex-
ified even subalgebra of Cl 3,0(R), Cl[0]
3,0(C), than the cor-
responding OPE that is O(ℏ2)with two terms supple-
menting the O(ℏ0)term. However, if we perform the
monomorphism to the larger algebra Cl 3,0(C), then we
can lower our algebra’s OPE dependence by one order of
ℏby using the odd term O(ℏ1)term for Pauli squared
instead of the even algebra’s O(ℏ2)term.
Written in terms of the even subalgebra, this will re-
move one of its overall Grassmann Fourier transforms. If
expressing everything within the even subalgebra is not
important (i.e. if you consider both the even and odd ele-
ments of Cl 3,0(C)to be local terms), then the even OPE
can be written fully at O(ℏ1)by replacing its O(ℏ2)term
by the Fourier transform of the O(ℏ1)odd expansion:
W1⋆ W2(ξ)
≡O(ℏ0) +O(ℏ1) +O(ℏ1) (108)
=W1(ξ)W2(ξ)

i⃗∂ξ1iW1(ξ)⃗∂ξ2iW2(ξ) (109)
−ℏi
2X
i⃗∂ρ1ifW1(ρ)⃗∂ρ2ifW2(ρ).
This means that the Cl 3,0(C)OPE of all single-
qubit operations (decomposable into unitary gates, non-
unitary channels, and single-qubit projections) are ex-
pressed in the Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(C)as linear combi-
nations of O(ℏ0)andO(ℏ1)terms involving products of
either even or odd elements. The number of such terms
generally proliferate exponentially if BQP ̸=BPP.
Note that in quantum field theory there is often an
implicit renormalization performed of the fields ξi→
ξi/√
ℏ[45]. This means that their even-dimensional su-
perpartners should be rescaled as ξiξj→ξiξj/ℏ. This
transforms the orders in Eq. 108 from O(ℏ0) +O(ℏ1)to
O(ℏ−1) +O(ℏ0).
As can be seen in Appendix C3, the Clifford algebra
Cl3,0(C)is actually able to capture the unitary single-
qubit unitary Clifford stabilizer subtheory with a single
O(ℏ1)term (and generallya polynomial number of O(ℏ1)
terms for nqubits, though we do not show this here).
This OPE written in terms of both even an odd
elements of Cl 3,0(C)will be enormously important in
the upcoming sections. Its use necessitates using the
full Cl 3,0(C)algebra in the mapping from complexified12
quaternions, instead of just the even elements Cl[0]
3,0(C)of
Cl3,0(C), which is otherwise sufficient. By incorporating
the full Cl 3,0(C)algebra we are able to lower the OPE to
first order in O(ℏ1), which we will see in the next section
makes it equivalent to the conformal Virasoro algebra.
This form of the OPE will be crucial in later allowing us
to produce entanglement entropies that agree with the
Ryu-Takayanagi formula for AdS spacetime.
E. Conformal Symmetry
In this section we will show how the OPE found in Sec-
tion D is a conformally symmetry OPE. By this we mean
that we will find the OPE is equivalent to the Witt alge-
bra commutation relations at O(ℏ0)and that the O(ℏ1)
terms are generated by a central charge anomaly and
extend the Witt algebra to the infinite-dimensional Vi-
rasoro algebra. But first, we begin with a general discus-
sion of conformal symmetry in Cl 3,0(R), when expressed
in Cl 3,0(C), and its Casimir operator.
We present a similar parallel presentation in Ap-
pendix C for how expressing the Clifford stabilizer
subtheory within Cl 3,0(C)respects the dimensional-
dependence of contextuality for qubits and qutrits. Con-
textuality(definedtherein)isequivalenttotheconformal
or central charge anomaly.
1. Action Invariance
The complexification of Cl 3,0(R)that allows for the
Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(C)to exhibit conformal symme-
try after the monomorphism from Cl 3,0(R). One way to
see this is that the inclusion of a third generator iξ3, to
complement ξ1andξ2defines a two-dimensional special
orthogonalgroupthatisaconformalsymmetrygroup(as
discussed in Section B) and Cl 3,0(C)contains all three
permutations of such bases.
Consider a Lagrangian of the general form given by
Eq. 75 with only one term, L=i
2ξlξm. We define a
new Lagrangian ˜Lrelated to Lby a conformal factor
containing the Grassmann element that it is independent
of:
˜L ≡eαξkiℏ
4ξlξm
=eαξkL, (110)
where α∈R. The Euler-Lagrange equations for this
conformal coordinate ξkare then
∂ξk
∂λ=−ieαξkL⃗∂
∂ξk=−α˜L, (111)
indicating that this Lagrangian’s corresponding equa-
tions of motion are related to the old one’s by just an
overall rescaling. Therefore, ˜L(and trivially Lby set-
tingα= 0) exhibit conformal symmetry.Similarly, considering a general generating action
within the Cl[0]
3,0(C)algebra,
S(ξ;t)=X
l,mϵklmtan(bkt/2)ξlξm,(112)
it follows that any transformation ξk→ξk+ϵ(ξk)leaves
this action unchanged.
Notice that this conformal symmetry requires a third
generator to be defined; given a Lagrangian or generating
action written in terms of two generators, ξlandξm, the
conformal coordinate will always be the third ξk. A two-
generator formalism with generators momentum pand
position q, as is common for finite odd-dimensional sys-
tems, cannot generally exhibit such conformal symmetry.
Also notice that any rotation between the three Grass-
mann generators simply redefines the third conformally
invariant element. It is always possible to actively
(rigidly)rotatethegeneratorsinaLagrangian L=i
2ξlξm
to a general quadratic form,
L=i
2(bkξlξm+blξmξk+bmξkξl),(113)
where b2

m= 1, by evolving them under the
dynamics of a Hamiltonian
H=X
i,jcijξiξj/2, (114)
where cijis antisymmetric, andP
i<jcij= 1. After
evolution for t=π,ξk→clξm−cmξl,ξl→ −ckξm+clξk,
andξm→ckξl−clξkand so we can identify bk=c2
k,
bl=ckcl, and bm=ckcl.
This means that in terms of these new rotated three-
generators the Lagrangian is conformally related to ˜L ≡
eξ′
kLwith conformal coordinate ξ′
k≡clξm−cmξl.
2. Central Charge Anomaly

the conformal group defined by the Cl 3,0(C)is

ford subalgebra Cl[0]
3,0(C)toO(ℏ1)produces
C2=1
4(ξ2
3) =ℏ
8. (116)
It follows that the central charge (using the usual rescal-
ing in physics) is c=ℏ
21
2.
Therefore, for ℏ= 0, the central charge is c= 0. In
condensed matter, this is typically associated with crit-
ical systems where second order phase transitions occur13
with quenched disorder [46]. At this value, the central
charge is non-informative about solutions of any confor-
mal field theory. This makes sense, since the Clifford
algebra Cl 3,0(C)becomes divergently disassociated with
the qubit quantum theory at this value.
Typically, for ℏ>0, the value is set to ℏ= 2to re-
produce the Pauli matrices in physics. This sets the cen-
tral charge to be c= 1/2, which is the central charge
associated with the free Majorana fermion representa-
tion. Note that the Majorana mapping that produces
the Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(C)does not correspond to this
free Majorana representation, since it produces bound
Hamiltonians for non-zero ℏ.
(We note that ℏ>0and the semiclassical limit ℏ→0
istypicallynotmeanttobeinterpretedasactuallychang-
ingℏ, but rather the set of equations under consideration
thatdependonit. Forexample, inOPEsitreferstowhen
its series expansions in terms of powers of ℏis dominated
by the lower order terms because the symplectic area ∆3
(see Eq. 87) is far larger than ℏso that ℏis effectively a
“small” but still fixed constant.)
3. Witt Algebra Centrally Extended to the Virasoro Algebra
Let us choose a preferred element of the Cl[0]
3,0(C)that
correspondstoaprojectorontoa(generally)mixedstate,
T(ξ)≡T0ξ0+T3ξ1ξ2+T2ξ1ξ3+T1ξ2ξ3,(117)
where T0̸= 0and at least one Ti̸= 0.
Borrowing the language of conformal field theory, this
is a “secondary field” since the OPE between Tand some
other element Vgiven in Eq. 95 can be rewritten as
′T ⋆ V′(ξ1,ξ2) =T0
V(0) +3X
j,k,l=1ϵijk⃗∂ξ2j˜V(ξ2)ξ2kξ2l

(118)
−iℏ
2T·⃗∂ξ2
V(ξ2) +˜V(ξ2)
,
where T≡(T1, T2, T3). Thus, Eq.118definesalocalfield
T(ξ1)that does not depend on ξ2and in general (with
other secondary fields) it will have on non-zero term in
its final line proportional to the central charge. Elements
Vthat produce a zero term proportional to the central
charge are called “primary fields” according to the con-
vention of conformal field theory.
Note that according to Eq. 118 a non-zero ℏis neces-
sary to both construct the conformal Witt algebra, since
the second term’s ˜V(ξ2)in the first line requires the ℏ-
dependent Grassmann Fourier transform, andthe (quan-
tum) conformal anomaly defined by the final term. This
effect of both defining the conformal algebra and a de-
viation from it can be attributed to Cl 3,0(C)’s feature of
being a cover of SL (2,R)instead of an isomorphism, as
discussed in Sections A-B.The OPE defined by Eq. 118 is equivalent to a basis-
independent formulation or representation of the com-
mutation relations of the Virasoro algebra, which is com-
monly defined in a basis on the ring C[z, z−1]:
[Lj, Lk] = (j−k)Lj+k+c
12(j3−j)δj+k,0,(119)
for
Lj≡ −zj+1∂z. (120)
This is satisfied by setting L±1≡ −(ˆξ1±iˆξ3)/2and
L0=ˆξ2/2and the algebra multiplication [·,·]to the
commutator (or, equivalently, by setting Lito the Killing
vectors Vµin Appendix E and the algebra multiplication
to their Lie bracket).
Assuming that fields V(z)are dependent on their posi-
tion through L−1V(z), this implies that the stress-energy
fieldT(y)can be defined holomorphically as T(y)V(z) =P
n∈ZLnV(z)
(y−z)n+2and implies that the OPE of the stress-
energy tensor with itself is
T(y)T(z) =c/2
(y−z)4+2T(z)
(y−z)2+∂T(z)
(y−z)+O(1),(121)
which canbecomparedto thebasis-independent Eq.118.
4. Trace Anomaly
Since we have identified the Grassmann Fourier trans-
form is an O(ℏ)operation (Eq. 53) it follows that its
trace (Eq. 82) of the stress-energy tensor T(ξ)(Eq. 117)
exhibits a trace anomaly []:
iZ
T(ξ)F(ξ0)d3ξ= 2/ℏZ
ξ0ξ1ξ2ξ3d3ξ= 2/ℏ(122)
Similarlyto ℏbeingproportionalthethecentralcharge
anomaly for the OPE with the stress-energy tensor, this
identifies ℏ−1>0as proportional for the trace anomaly
for the stress-energy tensor.
F. Bi-Quantized Seven-Generator Grassmanns and
Octonions
We established that the complexified quaternion alge-
bra is isomorphic to Cl[0]
3,0(C)in Section D and defined an
OPE equivalent to the Virasoro algebra through Eq. 108
in the larger Cl 3,0(C)algebra.
We have so far used two Clifford algebras that are iso-
morphic to the complexified quaternion algebra, Cl 3,0(R)
and Cl[0]
3,0(C), and expressed them after an ℏ-dependent
monomorphism in the larger Cl 3,0(C)algebra.
This larger Cl 3,0(C)algebra is itself also isomorphic
to another Clifford algebra: Cl[0]
4,0(C). However, this
isomorphism is “non-canonical”, i.e. the isomorphism is14
generally shown with respect to the orthogonal idempo-
tents of their isomorphic matrix algebras over C(using
the Wedderburn-Artin theorem [47]), which requires ar-
bitrarily choosing a basis or representation, instead of by
a “basis-independent” element-to-element morphism.
This non-canonical aspect of the isomorphism suggests
we can express one physical theory in terms of another,
or mathematically-speaking, in terms of a dual algebra
that produces an extension of the original algebra.
Luckily, there is another Clifford algebra that is
isomorphic to the complexified quaternion algebra,
Cl2,0(C), from which it is particularly straight-forward
to define a monomorphism to Cl[0]
4,0(C), as we saw in Sec-
tion B.
Following this intuition, we would like to create an ex-
tension of the quaternion algebra by the algebra Cl 2,0(C)
monomorphically mapped to Cl[0]
4,0(C). Our intuition
seems to be justified by the fact that the only non-trivial
normed division algebra that can be an extension of the
quaternion algebra must contain twice the number of el-
ements and be eight-dimensional [29, 30]. This means
that if we are committed to only dealing with Clifford
algebras, we mustexpress Cl 2,0(C)as a subalgebra in
Cl[0]
4,0(C)∼=Cl3,0(C)to double the dimension appropri-
ately and produce a normed division algebra.
This mapping from Cl 2,0(C)will require a new
monomorphism, and we choose for it to depend on a
newdimensionlessquantizationconstant, G. Wewillfind
that this produces the octonion algebra as discussed in
Section B.
We define this new G-dependent monomorphism in a
similar manner to the ℏ-dependent one by first defining a
quantization of the Poisson bracket of Clifford algebra el-
ements to the complexified quaternion algebra. However,
note that here the Poisson bracket we quantize will actu-
allybeinCl 4,0(C),insteadofCl[0]
4,0(C)∼=n.c.Cl3,0(C),though
we will subsequently focus on the latter subalgebra of the
former. WequantizethePoissonbracketwithinthe(even
larger) Cl 4,0(C)algebra because we want to quantize four
generators so that they become the four new elements to
extend our normed division algebra, not three.
1. Canonical Quantization
Forµ,ν∈ {4,5,6,7}, we define
{ξµ, ξν}P.B.→ {ˆξµ,ˆξν}=Gδµν,(123)
At this point we do not mean to imply anything physical
by selecting our quantization variables to be G, and this
constant should just be treated similarly to ℏ: a dimen-
sionless parameter. We will not justify its interpretation
as a dimensionless analog to the gravitational constant
until Section G.This means that
ˆξµˆξν=(ˆξνifµ= 0
ˆξµifν= 0.(124)
When we quantized the Poisson bracket in Cl 3,0(R)
we produced Pauli operators and the quaternion alge-
bra, which is an algebra that is considerable less esoteric
in the physics community compared to the octonion al-
gebra. Since the non-quaternion quantized operators are
likely less familiar to many readers, we will explore their
relations here in more detail.
Since Cl[0]
3,0(C)∼=Cl2,0(C), it follows that the three
quaternion ℏ-quantized generators ˆξiand the four non-
quaternion G-quantized generators ˆξµsatisfy the follow-
ing multiplication rules
ˆξµˆξν=n
δµνˆξ0−ϵµνρˆξρifµ, ν̸= 0,(125)
where ϵµνρis a completely antisymmetric tensor with
value 1when µνρ= 123,145,176,246,257,347,365(an
arbitrary choice of convention), and we have temporarily
setℏ=G= 2.
We can find the appropriate proportionality factor by
noting that since ˆξµˆξνis proportional to ˆξi,
(ˆξµˆξν)2=−ˆξ2
µˆξ2
ν=−G2/4 (126)
=⇒ˆξµˆξν=±ip
G2/2ℏˆξi.(127)
For future reference, we rewrite the full octonion mul-
tiplication rules with ℏandGshown:

ˆξµ ifν= 0

where ϵµνρis a completely antisymmetric tensor with
value 1when µνρ= 123,145,176,246,257,347,365.
ThecorrespondingoctonionrelationsareshowninFig-
ure 4.
For completeness, we can also note that since ˆξiˆξµis
proportional to a ˆξν, it follows that
(ˆξiˆξµ)2=−ˆξ2
iˆξ2
µ=−ℏG/4 (129)
=⇒ˆξiˆξµ=±ip
ℏ/2ˆξν. (130)
Finally, since ˆξµˆξνis proportional to ˆξρˆξσforµ̸=ν̸=
ρ̸=σ.
(ˆξµˆξν)2=−ˆξ2
µˆξ2
ν=−G2/4 (131)
=⇒ˆξµˆξν=±ˆξρˆξσ. (132)
Along with ϵijkˆξiˆξj=−ip
ℏ/2ˆξk, this completes all
possiblemultiplicationruleswiththeirexplicitconstants.
ˆξµextend the algebra to a non-associative algebra.
This means that there is no matrix representation of ˆξµ,15
FIG. 4. The octonion multiplication rules are shown at
the top by arrows (this is called an octonion Fano plane
mnemonic [48]). Below that are listed one order of the cor-
responding octonion multiplication identities and how they
split up in the AdS/qubit duality.

unlike the case for ˆξi, which we showed could be repre-
sented by the Pauli matrices in two-dimensions.
WesawinSection Bthattheevenproductsofthenon-
quaternion operators, ˆξµˆξν, correspond to AdS 3isometry
group operations. To see what the single non-quaternion
operatorscorrespondto, consider (1+1) ×(1+1)tensored
Minkowskispacetimewithcoordinates (t, x, t′, x′). These
are the coordinates of the four-dimensional embedding
spacetime with Minkowski metric.
The following identities, which mix ˆξiand ˆξµ, hold
from the octonion algebra:
ip
G2/2ℏˆξ4=ˆξ1ˆξ5=ˆξ2ˆξ6=ˆξ3ˆξ7,(133)
ip
G2/2ℏˆξ5=ˆξ4ˆξ1=ˆξ2ˆξ7=ˆξ6ˆξ3,(134)
ip
G2/2ℏˆξ6=ˆξ7ˆξ1=ˆξ4ˆξ2=ˆξ3ˆξ5,(135)
ip
G2/2ℏˆξ7=ˆξ1ˆξ6=ˆξ5ˆξ2=ˆξ4ˆξ3.(136)
As found in Section B, taking into account the imag-
inary constants in Eqs. 18-21 that relate these to thespacetime, it follows that −(iˆξ4)2=−(iˆξ6)2=ˆξ2
5=ˆξ2
7=
1and this defines the metric signature (−+−+)of the
embedding space.
Thus, (ˆξ4,ˆξ5,ˆξ6,ˆξ7)can be interpreted as the quanti-
zation of translations along (t, x, y, z ),
(ˆξ4,ˆξ5,ˆξ6,ˆξ7)≡dt
dλ,dx
dλ,dt′
dλ,dx′
dλ
.(137)
These identities can be interpreted as a relationship
between spin degrees of freedom and time boosts and
space shifts in special relativity. For example, consider
the spin-flip operation ˆXassociated with ξ1, when acting
on a spin in the z-direction. The first line (Eq. 133) of
the identities above imply that boosting a spin in t−
x, which we found in the prior subsection is given by
the Lorentz element ξ4ξ5(the embedded space inherits
the isometries of the embedding space), is equivalent to
flipping its spin, i.e. ξ1≡X. See Figure 5 for a depiction
of this relationship and how a shift in time tand a shift
in space xreverses the perpendicular components of a
z-spin.
Similarly, rotating in the t−t′plane or boosting along
t−x′is equivalent to ξ2≡Zandξ3≡Y, respectively.
Flipping the order of ξiξνabove introduces a minus
sign and corresponds to time reversal for ξ4andξ6and
space parity reversal for ξ5andξ7.
2. Monomorphism from Cl[0]
4,0(C)to Cl 2,0(C)⊆Cl[0]
4,0(C)
We examine the identity from the octonion algebra
that relates the non-quaternion generators to the quater-
nion generators:
1√
2ℏˆξi=−i1
Gˆξµˆξν. (138)
Similarly, the even elements are related by
1
ℏˆξiˆξj=1
Gˆξρˆξµ. (139)
This is a convenient identity since as mentioned in Sec-
tion D, in quantum field theory these fields are renormal-
izedξiξj→ξiξj/ℏand in string theory a similar renor-
malization is frequently performed: ξµξν→ξµξν/G.
With this in mind, we define an isomorphism σbe-
tween Cl[0]
3,0(C)and a subalgebra of Cl[0]
4,0(C)isomorphic
to Cl 2,0(C)∼=Cl[0]
3,0(C)∼=Cl3,0(R), by identifying the
corresponding elements:
ξ0σ↔¯ξ0, (140)
√
2ℏiξ1, ξ2ξ3σ↔¯ξ4¯ξ5=¯ξ7¯ξ6 (141)
√
2ℏiξ2, ξ1ξ3σ↔¯ξ4¯ξ6=¯ξ5¯ξ7 (142)
√
2ℏiξ3, ξ1ξ2σ↔¯ξ4¯ξ7=¯ξ6¯ξ5. (143)
Notice that even though there are two even non-
quaternion terms that are equal to every quaternion even16
term, they are meant to be defined on different subspaces
so this is still a bijective map and thus an isomorphism.
We denote the elements of this subalgebra of Cl[0]
4,0(C)
by bars, instead of without any overhead modifier, to
take into account that they are dependent on bothℏand
G, as we shall shortly see.
This map can be trivially extended to apply to the
complexified larger algebra, Cl 3,0(C), and thereby de-
fine a monomorphism from the Cl 2,0(C)subalgebra of
Cl[0]
4,0(C)to Cl[0]
4,0(C)using the monomorphism from
Cl[0]
3,0(C)to Cl 3,0(C)defined in Section C1:
Cl[0]
4,0(C)⊇Cl2,0(C)σ↔Cl[0]
3,0(C)ℏ>0,→Cl3,0(C)σ↔Cl[0]
4,0(C).
(144)
If we define a four-generator element in the Cl[0]
4,0(C)
algebra to be
¯g(¯ξ) = ¯g0¯ξ0+7X
µ,ν=4¯gµν¯ξµ¯ξν+7X
µ,ν,ρ,σ =4¯gµνρσ¯ξµ¯ξν¯ξρ¯ξσ,
(145)
we can similarly define a dual to this non-quaternionic
¯g(¯ξ)through the Grassmann Fourier transform restricted
to these four generators:
¯g(¯ξ) =¯F(¯˜g(ρ))≡2
GZ
ei√
G/2P7
k=4¯ξk¯ρk˜¯g(¯ρ)d¯ρ7d¯ρ6d¯ρ5d¯ρ4.
(146)
Therefore, the inverse Grassmann Fourier transform on
these four generators must be,
˜¯g(¯ρ) =¯F−1(˜g(¯ξ)) (147)
≡2
GZ
e−i√
G/2P7
k=4¯ξk¯ρk¯g(¯ξ)d¯ξ7d¯ξ6d¯ξ5d¯ξ4.(148)
In Section C1 the Grassmann Fourier transform al-
lowed us to express the monomorphism Cl[0]
3,0(C)ℏ>0,→
Cl3,0(C)withoutreferringtothequantizationofthePois-
son bracket. Similarly, here we will be able to use the
Grassmann Fourier transform restricted to Cl[0]
4,0(C)to
notonlydefinethemonomorphismgivenbyEq.144with-
out referring to the quantization of its Poisson bracket,
but also without referring to the intermediate map σ
through Cl[0]
3,0(C).
As we have defined it so far, ˜¯g(¯ρ)has the same form
as¯g(¯ξ), namely
˜¯g(¯ρ) =˜¯g0¯ρ0+7X

µ,ν,ρ,σ =4˜¯gµνρσ¯ρµ¯ρν¯ρρ¯ρσ.
(149)
When defined over three generators, we found that the
Grassmann Fourier transform related odd and even co-
efficients. Here, we can find that the Grassmann Fourier
transform relates same-grade coefficients of ˜¯g(¯ρ)to thethose of ¯g(¯ξ)in the following manner:
˜¯g45−˜¯g54= ¯g67−¯g76,(150)
˜¯g47−˜¯g74= ¯g56−¯g65,(151)

We will refer to ¯g(¯ξ)as theAdS dual element and ˜¯g(¯ξ)
as its Grassmann Fourier transform. As we have defined
it, the AdS dual element is related to quadratic products
of only three of the four generators. Thus, it is clearly
isomorphic to Cl[0]
3,0(C)∈Cl2,0(C).
Itfollowsthatwecanequivalentlydefinethemonomor-
phism given in Eq. 144 by
Cl2,0(C)G>0,→Cl[0]
4,0(C)≡Cl2,0(C)⊕ F(Cl2,0(C)),(158)
where by Cl 2,0(C)in Eq. 158 we mean to imply the
Cl2,0(C)subalgebra expressed within Cl[0]
4,0(C). We note
that the monomorphism defined by Eq. 158 can only be
applied to ¯g(¯ξ)∈Cl2,0(C)⊆Cl[0]
4,0(C)much like the case
for the monomorphism defined from Cl[0]
3,0(C)to Cl 3,0(C),
which only applied to g(ξ)∈Cl[0]

mann Fourier transforms.
Since we have defined the AdS dual element to be
quadratic products of only three of the four generators, it

must have an additional Grassmann integral to run over

AdS dual elements ˜¯g.17

duces the same expansion as found for Cl[0]

It is easy to verify that the O(G0)term captures
Paulitimesidentity, the O(G1)termcapturesPaulitimes
Pauli, and the O(G2)term captures Pauli squared terms.
These identifications can also be seen by examining
their quantized products:
ˆξµˆξνˆξ0=ˆξµˆξν∈ O(G0), (163)
ˆξµˆξνˆξµˆξρ=−iG
2ˆξρˆξν∈ O(G1),(164)
(ˆξµˆξν)2=G2
4ˆξ0∈ O(G2). (165)
However, taking the full Cl[0]
4,0(C)algebra into account
to reduce the order of the last term can be reduced to
O(G1)produces a different form:
¯W1⋆¯W2(¯ξ)

Notice that the second O(G1)term involves a
global Grassmann Fourier transform unlike the OPE
in Cl 3,0(C). This means it is not strictly an OPE in
the conformal sense, i.e. it is not equivalent to the Vi-
rasoro algebra. This can be explained with the re-
minder that Cl[0]
4,0(C)∼=n-cCl3,0(R), where∼=n-cdenotes a non-
canonical isomorphism. Therefore, term-by-term, this
non-canonical isomorphism maps the OPE in Cl 3,0(C)
to a non-conformal form in Cl[0]
4,0(C).
Finally, note again that in string theory, much like in
quantum field theory, there is often an implicit renor-
malization performed of the fields ξµξν→ξµξν/G. This
transforms the orders in Eq. 166 from O(G0) +O(G1)to
O(G−1) +O(G0).4. Symplectic Structure
Here we will find that we can define a Lagrangian
as a quadratic function of ¯ξµin Cl[0]
4,0(C)similar to La-
grangians in Cl 3,0(C):
L=−7X
µ,ν,ρ =4ϵρµνgµν¯ξµ¯ξν. (168)

nion Lagrangian,

fully at O(ℏ1), are

O(G1)can be found from these to be

reveals that the Lagrangian L=−Hin terms of the dual
non-quaternion generators is
−L ≡ − (¯L+˜¯L) =i(¯ξρ¯ξµ+¯ξσ¯ξν).(180)
This can also be found by performing the isomorphism
from the prior Lagrangian in Cl 3,0(C)and including both
equal non-quaternion terms in a uniformly weighted lin-
ear combination.
AswemotivatedinSection BandshowinAppendixE,
¯ξµ¯ξνare equal to the Killing vectors, {Kρ

dinates x(the subscript (µ, ν)indexes the Killing vectors
and is in parentheses so as not to be mistaken for a tensor
index).
Therefore, while we can associate the Lin Cl 3,0(C)as
the Lagrangian of spin equations of motion, the isomor-
phicLinCl[0]
4,0(C)canbeequivalentlyassociatedwiththe
Lagrangian of isometry generator equations of motion.
G. The holographic principle
The quantization of three (of seven) generators by ℏ
andtheremainingfourby Geffectivelydefinedtwodiffer-
ent monomorphisms, the first from Cl 3,0(R)to Cl 3,0(C)
and the second from Cl 2,0(C)⊆Cl[0]
4,0(C)to Cl[0]
4,0(C).
We identify ℏwith a dimensionless analog to Planck’s
constant in Appendix C5. Here we will also justify iden-
tifying the quantization variable of the extension of the
quaternion algebra, G, with a dimensionless analog to
the gravitational constant (technically G(3)
N, the Newton
constant in 2 + 1spacetime).
The full algebra can be defined by the triply-nested
anticommutator
(n
ˆξµ{ˆξi,ˆξj}o
,ˆξν)
=Gℏδijδµν.(181)
Thisdefinesthethreedifferentproductspossiblebetween
the two quantized groups of generators.
Eq. 181 reveals that Gℏis a conserved area in the
sense that the full quantum gravity theory can be for-
mulated semiclassically in terms of linear combinations
ofO(ℏ1G1)stationary phase points each corresponding
to the symplectic dynamics of the seven-generator Grass-
mann algebra, which individually preserve area Gℏ. This
is the same as the quantum subtheory, which can be
formulated semiclassically in terms of O(ℏ1)stationary
phase points corresponding to the symplectic dynamics
ofthethree-generatorGrassmannalgebra, whichindivid-
ually preserve the area ℏ[41].
For a two-dimension CFT the Planck length, lP= ℏG
c31/2and Planck time, tP= ℏG
c51/2, is constant.
Here, for a 2 + 1bulk spacetime, area corresponds to
lengthtimestime, whichisthusproportionalto ℏG. This
means that this quantization into ℏandGis really just
enforcing the area law and holographic principle, as ex-
pected from a 2Dconformal field theory, and thereby
defines the Gquantization variable as the gravitational
constant.
As a result, here we can finally formally associate Gto
be a dimensionless analog to the gravitational constant
and we do so henceforth.H. Dictionary
We would like to summarize the findings from Sec-
tions F-G here and formally establish the “dictionary”
of the AdS 3/qubit correspondence presented. To do this
it is instructive to review three steps in the quantization
procedure above, and how they each produce a specific
field:
1. Quantization of ξibyℏproduces fields correspond-
ingtogeneratorsofsingle-qubitspindegreesoffree-
dom (represented by the Pauli matrices): ˆξi↔ˆσi
2. Quantizationof ξµbyGproducesfieldscorrespond-
ing to generators of translation along the degrees
of freedom of an embedding spacetime with a (2,2)
signature: ˆξµ↔dxµ
dλ
3. Imposing the octonion algebraic multiplication
rules upon the non-quaternion elements produces
O(G0)fields ¯ξµ¯ξνcorresponding to generators of
spacetime isometries (i.e. Killing vectors) of the
embedded AdS 3spacetime with (1,2)signature:
¯ξµ¯ξν↔xµ∂xν±xν∂xµ
We proceed to highlight how the usual consequences of
this duality in the continuous AdS/CFT correspondence
appearhereintermsofaconformal/isometrydualityand
a strong/weak duality.
1. Conformal Theory/SO+(2,2)Isometries of AdS 3
We found in Section E that Cl 3,0(C)is able to capture
the multiplication rules of the Cl[0]
3,0(C)enveloping alge-
bra of the SO+(2,2)/SO+(1,2)isometry group in terms
of an operator product expansion that is equivalent to
the Virasoro algebra. This is similar to the CFT/AdS
duality of the eponymous correspondence.
2. Strong/Weak Duality
We found in Section F2 (Eq. 139) that
ℏ
Gˆξµˆξν=ˆξiˆξj. (182)
Therefore, taking ℏ→0and fixing G >0is equivalent
to taking G→ ∞and fixing ℏ>0. Similarly, taking
ℏ→ ∞and fixing G > 0is equivalent to taking G→0
and fixing ℏ>0.
Consider L=ξiξjand the isomorphic L=¯ξµ¯ξν+¯ξρ¯ξσ.
It follows that taking ℏ→0and fixing G >0produces

Therefore, in the limit that ℏ→ ∞theℏcoupling
between the Majoranas given by H=i
2P
ijkϵijkbiξiξj
becomes strong and in this limit the equations of motion
for¯ξµ¯ξνcorrespond to classical equations of motion for
isometry generators in AdS 3.
On the other hand, in the limit that ℏ→0theℏ
coupling between the Majoranas in the qubit Hamilto-
nians H=i
2P
ijkϵijkbiξiξjbecomes weak (sincedξi
dλ=
(ℏ/2)H⃗∂ξi) and in this limit the equations of motion for
¯ξµ¯ξνcorrespond to non-classical equations of motion for
coupled isometry generators in AdS 3.
Note that ℏ→ ∞does not correspond the the equa-
tions become more quantum, as this is a rescaling that
also changes the effective Planck’s constant (action area).
Indeed, the simplification that occurs in the dual algebra
reveals that the effective Planck’s constant actually van-
ishes in this limit. In fact, its equations of motion can
be associated with the trivial dynamics of a maximally
mixed thermal state at the center of the Bloch sphere.
3. Bulk/Boundary Correspondence
The AdS 3algebra elements ˆξµproduce a larger-
dimensional space corresponding to the Minkowski 2 + 2
embedding space. They define a lower-dimensional space
spanned by ˆξiwherein the SO(2,2)isometry conformal
group is defined. In this sense, there is a bulk/boundary
correspondence. However, as discussed in Figure 1, in
the AdS/CFT correspondence the AdS bulk only corre-
sponds to a CFT at conformal infinity where it becomes
a Minkowski spacetime. Here we are associating the bulk
with a global Minkowski spacetime.
4. Supersymmetry
In the original AdS/CFT conjecture [1], N= 4SYM
theory, which is maximally symmetric, was conjectured
to be dual to AdS 5×S5space, which is a maximally su-
persymmetric solution of ten-dimensional supergravity.
The32Killing spinors corresponded to the supercharges
ofN= 4SYM generated by complex Majoranas, along
with similar correspondences among the other symme-
tries and fields. As discussed in Section B, Section F
and Section H, the ξigenerators expressed in Cl 3,0(C)
are similarly supersymmetric Majorana fields that are
isomorphic to Killing vectors ¯ξµ¯ξνexpressed in Cl[0]
4,0(C).I. Perturbed AdS 3Spacetime
AdS dis a maximally symmetric spacetimes and so con-
tainn(n+ 1)/2isometries (i.e. Killing vectors). There-
fore, AdS 3has six isometries. By expressing AdS 3as a
homogeneoussymmetricspace, thesixisometriesofAdS 3
arepairedintothreeequivalentisometries(corresponding
to clockwise and counter-clockwise isometry transforma-
tions found in Appendix E).
We would like to explore non-maximally symmetric
spacetimes that are perturbatively close to AdS 3. One
way to accomplish this is by introducing a perturbation
that removes one of the isometries. Here, we will ac-
complish this through a O(G)transformation that corre-
sponds to an infinitesimal symmetry-breaking boost be-
tween xandx′(in terms of the coordinates defined in
Section F).
As discussed before, the Paulis ξi=ξµξνand the iden-
tity element ξ0, together constituting the quaternion al-
gebra, generate the isometries of the AdS 3spacetime.
Rigid rotations take these isometries to linear combina-
tions of the original isometries.
For instance, as we show in Appendix D, the rotation
effected by evolution under the Hamiltonian H=ξ1ξ3
for time π/2produces the Tgate magic state, |T⟩⟨T|=
(I+ (X+Y)/√
2)/2. These are characterized by con-
sisting of two O(ℏ1)terms. Supplementing the stabilizer
states and including Pauli measurements, this produces
a universal set of states for measurement-based quantum
computation [49].
This set, along with equivalent axial magic states, is
sketched in Figure 6.

FIG. 6. Isometries of AdS space without magic (black), and
with magic states (grey). In either case, there exists at least
one Killing horizon (red) with a black hole corresponding to
the Bloch sphere origin.
Notice that the inclusion of a quantum magic state
such as |T⟩⟨T|through a rotation of one of the generators
by Eq. 114 does not supplement the stabilizer states with
the remaining generators, as they are also rigidly rotated
sothattheymaintaintheirmutualrelations(seeEqs.D3-20
D5).
Such a transformation does not change the number of
isometries; the group of the spacetime remains the same,
and so the spacetime remains AdS 3after the transforma-
tion.
Atransformationthatproducesisometriescorrespond-
ing tobothstabilizer states and magic states requires a
Hamiltonian (Eq. 114) over three generators that are not
restricted to ξ1,ξ2andξ3. This cannot be effected by
a transformation to any order in ℏwithout higher order
than (G0), as such quantum transformations are still re-
strictedtobeconformal(i.e. respecttheVirasoroalgebra
commutation relations). However, as we shall see, this is
possible with a O(G)transformation.
Consider the transformation
ˆξ5→cosh( δτ)ˆξ5+ sinh( δτ)ˆξ7(187)
=⇒ˆξ5=ˆξ5+δτℏˆξ7+O(δτ2), (188)
ˆξ7→cosh( δτ)ˆξ7+ sinh( δτ)ˆξ5(189)
=⇒ˆξ7=ˆξ7+δτℏˆξ5+O(δτ2). (190)
This is not a O(G0)symplectic transformation and so
cannot be associated with a Hamiltonian in Cl 3,0(C).
Since it involves the octonion algebra addition, it is a
O(G1)transformationandcanbeconsideredtobethere-
sult of a linear combination of two Hamiltonians evolved
forτ=π—H1=iξ0andH2=i√
2(ξ5ξ6+ξ6ξ4+ξ4ξ5+
ξ7ξ4)—the identity that leaves ˆξ5andˆξ7unchanged and
a rotation that exchanges them. Note that these two
evolutions together form a Lorentz boost in this non-
quaternion sub-algebra, which is not a symplectic (area-
preserving) transformation for usual two-forms relating
conjugate degrees of freedom.
Notice that this differs from the O(ℏ1)transformation
that produces the T gate. The T gate can be viewed as
a symplectic transformation to a linear combination of
O(ℏ1)terms in Cl 3,0(C). On the other hand, Eq. 187 is
anO(G)non-symplectic transformation to a linear com-
bination of O(G1)terms in the non-isomorphic larger
algebra Cl 4,0(C). We will see that this its ℏ-dependence
will be O(ℏ2).
Restricting to the subalgebra Cl[0]
4,0∼=n.c.Cl3,0(C), this
O(G)transformation has the effect of splitting the two-
fold correspondence between ˆξµˆξν,ˆξρˆξτandˆξi:
ˆξ4ˆξ5→ˆξ4ˆξ5+δτˆξ4ˆξ7+O(δτ2), (191)
ˆξ7ˆξ6→ˆξ7ˆξ6+δτˆξ5ˆξ6+O(δτ2), (192)
ˆξ4ˆξ6→ˆξ4ˆξ6, (193)
ˆξ5ˆξ7→ˆξ5ˆξ7+δτGℏ2ˆξ0+O(δτ2),(194)
ˆξ4ˆξ7→ˆξ4ˆξ7+δτˆξ4ˆξ5+O(δτ2), (195)
ˆξ6ˆξ5→ˆξ6ˆξ5+δτˆξ6ˆξ7+O(δτ2), (196)
The former ˆξ5ˆξ7isometry obtains a grade-zero compo-
nent under this transformation and thus ceases to be an
isometry.Notice that this transformation between ξ5and ξ7
(corresponding to xandx′) produces an algebra non-
canonically isomorphic to sl(2,R).sl(2,R)is generated
byˆξ0,−ˆξ1=K01⊕K32,−ˆξ2=K21⊕K03, and
−iξ3=J02⊕J13, where ˆξµˆξν=−iGˆξj/√
2ℏ. This
means that only two of the isometries are equal to ˆξµˆξν
with a real-valued constant: ˆξ5ˆξ7=J02andˆξ4ˆξ7=J13.
Thismeansthatthereal-valued O(G)termabovefor ˆξ5ˆξ7
remains real-valued. A similar transformation between
ξ4andξ6(corresponding to tandt′) would similarly
preserve sl(2,R). On the other hand, non-hyperbolic
rotations between the other non-quaternion generators
(which would now correspond to simply rotations instead
of boosts) would introduce an imaginary-valued O(G)
term because they are equal to iKµinstead of Kµ. Such
transformations would no longer preserve sl(2,R).
Eqs. 191-196 can be more succinctly written just in
terms of the quaternions:
ˆξ′
1≡ˆξ1+δτˆξ2+O(δτ2), (197)
ˆξ′′
1≡ˆξ1−δτˆξ2+O(δτ2), (198)
ˆξ′
3≡ˆξ3+O(δτ2), (199)
ˆξ′′
3≡ˆξ3+δτGℏ2ˆξ0+O(δτ2), (200)
ˆξ′
2≡ˆξ2+δτˆξ1+O(δτ2), (201)
ˆξ′′
2≡ˆξ2−δτˆξ1+O(δτ2). (202)
Notice that ˆξi̸=ˆξ′
i̸=ˆξ′′
i. This means that this O(G)
transformation splits every isometry into two isometries
except for ξ3. The latter is split into itself and a lin-
ear combination that includes a term proportional to the
identity, which is no longer an isometry. Therefore, the
five new isometries are no longer Clifford-isomorphic to
the Paulis. Recall that quantum magic state transforma-
tions preserved the three isometries Clifford-isomorphic
to the Paulis due to the restriction that the theory is
conformal when expressed in terms of three generators.
This means that the ˆξ′
iandˆξ′′
ino longer define a con-
formally invariant field theory. This can also be seen by
finding that there is no way to express a Lagrangian that
is independent of all the new isometries, since they all
sequentially overlap with each other.
TakingacloserlookatEqs.197-202, thetangenttothe
Killing horizon ξ1is now split into ξ′
1andξ′′
1which have
oppositecomponentsalongtheKillinghorizonnormal ξ3.
These correspond to trapping and escaping isometries as
they lie on either side of the Killing horizon. ξ2has been
accordingly split as well into ξ′
2andξ′′
2.
As already discussed, the normal to the Killing hori-
zon, ξ3, has been split into itself, ξ′
3, and ξ′′
3. This is
a non-normalized linear combination for any non-zero ℏ
since ξ′′
3has a component on ξ0with coefficient propor-
tional to Gℏ2. This is reflective of the non-conformality
of this field theory after the O(G)transformation and
can be interpreted as indicating that this is a higher or-
derGℏ2non-unitary effect.21
As we shall see, the ξ′
3term corresponds to a product
of the Killing horizon with an even linear combination
of escaping and trapping isometries. We will find that
it is responsible for Hawking radiation from pair produc-
tion before the Page curve turning point. Similarly, we
will see that the ξ′′
3term corresponds to a product of the
Killing horizon with a linear combination of these isome-
tries along with a term proportional to the identity. We
will see that this last term allows ξ′′
3to be interpreted
as possessing a “wormhole” term, which is an O(ℏ2G1)
“uniformizing” term, wherein the two isometries interact
with each other through the identity or origin term.
These associations can be made explicit by noticing
that the usual Pauli product rule ˆξ3=ip
ℏ/2ˆξ1ˆξ2can be
rewritten in terms of these new isometries,
ˆξ′
3=ip
ℏ/2(ˆξ′
1+ˆξ′′

ˆξ′′
3=ip
ℏ/2(ˆξ′
1+ˆξ′′
1)ˆξ2+δτGℏ2ˆξ0+O(δτ2).(204)
Eq. 203 is similar to the solution of the Airy function
when the area subtended by two stationary phase points
islargecomparedto ℏgivenbyEq.G4(seeAppendixG).
Eq. 204 is similar to the uniformized solution when the
area subtended by the two stationary phase points be-
come on the order of ℏGgiven by Eq. G6.
This means that both ξ′
3andξ′
3isometries are a prod-
uct of the escaping and trapping isometries. However, as
explained in Appendix G, instead of “interacting” with
the origin, for ξ′′
3these two isometries interact with each
other.
Moreover,the ˆξ′
iandξ′′
iisometriescanberelatedtolin-
ear combinations of particle/anti-particle isometries by
noting that
ˆξi=(ˆui+ ˆu∗
i)/2, (205)
ˆξµ=−(ˆui−ˆu∗
i)/2, (206)
where ˆuiand ˆu∗
iare the Fermi annihilation and cre-
ation operators introduced in Appendix C5 (Eqs. C3-
C4). Therefore, you can associate these isometries with
probabilistic quantum operations on both particles and
anti-particles. This means that some of the particles can
be inside the black hole with probability pand outside
the black hole with probability 1−p(and vice-versa for
the anti-particles) depending on the linear combination
(i.e. magnitude of δτor of the Lorentz boost generally).

This implies that creating a particle from vacuum in
thejth state is the same as creating an antiparticle from
vacuum in the jth state and reveals that such a Fermi
particle is entangled with its anti-particle. This entangle-
ment property is what leads to the information paradox
given that these isometries lie on opposite sides of the
Killing horizon [51, 52].
The isometries are sketched in Fig. 7.
Notice that performing the O(G)transformation given
by Eq. 187 in any other rotation direction will still pro-
duce the same qualitative isometries above. Only the
coefficients will be changed.

FIG. 7. Isometries of perturbed AdS 3space after O(G)trans-
formation given by Eq. 187.
It is important to note that any O(G)transforma-
tion that splits an isometry from being tangential to
the Killing horizon to two isometries that lie on opposite
sides will necessarily introduce a “wormhole”-containing
ξ′′
3term to the normal isometry. This is because the nor-
mal isometry must contain one ξµξνthat is unaffected by
the transformation and another ξρξτthat is. Since the
two must lie at equal angles to the original isometry and
ξµξνremains the same, it follows that ξµξνmust remain
colinear and can only develop a new component along ξ0.
Therefore, this O(G)transformation’s production of
escaping and trapping isometries (which produces a ther-
modynamically stable evaporative black hole and per-
turbed AdS 3spacetime) necessarily produces a “worm-
hole” term. The two phenomena are inseparable in this
formalism.22
J. The RT Formula for AdS 3
1. General Formula

S(ρA) =−Tr(ρAlogρA) =−Z
(ρA⋆logρA)(ξ)ξ3ξ2ξ1d3ξ,
(211)
where ρA≡TrBρ.
As it is written in the Cl 3,0(C)algebra in Eq. 211, this
is an integral over a product of two operators. We would
like to express this product as a dual AdS OPE in the
Cl[0]
4,0(C)subalgebra using Eq. 166. Since we are taking
a Grassmann four-generator integral of (ρA⋆logρA)(ξ)
with ξ7ξ6ξ5ξ4, it follows that the integral is only non zero
for the O(ℏ0G0)identity squared term and the second
O(G1ℏ1)Pauli squared term of the OPE:
S(ρA) =−Z

IfρA(ξ)isO(ℏ0G0), the first term in Eq. 212 is
O(ℏ0G0)and the second is O(ℏ1G1). We shall see that
this is the case for quantum theory within AdS 3space-
time.
The Ryu-Takayanagi formula [7, 8] for the entropy of
ρAis
S(ρA) = Tr( ρLA) +Sbulk(ρϵA) +O(ℏ0),(213)
where ρAis a boundary CFT state on boundary Aof
a larger ρCFT state b, and LAis a local operator in
the bulk integrated over γA, and Sbulk(ρϵA)is the bulk
von Neumann entropy in ϵA. At leading order in G,
LA=Area(γA)/4G. Accounting for ℏ−1G−1implicit
normalization, the first term in Eq. 213 is O(G0ℏ0)and
the second is O(G1ℏ1)[53].
With these order expansions, we can relate the cor-
responding terms in Eq. 212 to the terms in Eq. 213,
assuming ρA(ξ)isO(ℏ0):
Tr(ρLA) =−Z
¯ρA(¯ξ)logρA(¯ξ)¯ξ4¯ξ5¯ξ6¯ξ7d3¯ξ(214)

Entanglement between subsystem A and traced out
degrees of freedom will produce a mixed state after the
trace. Any mixed state on a qubit can be written as a
convex combination of pure states corresponding to sta-
bilizer states and (quantum) magic states. We will nowproceed to examine these two cases of pure states ob-
tained by tracing out to subsystem A, with the expec-
tation that they correspond to a single term in such a
convex decomposition. We will also examine the case of
a “gravitational” magic pure state corresponding to the
O(G1)transformation in Section I.
2. RT Applied to Stabilizer States
Consider a stabilizer state ˆρA= (ˆξ0+iˆξiˆξj)/2(see
Appendix C1 for their derivation). This has AdS dual
element
¯ρA(¯ξ) = ( ¯ξ0+¯ξµ¯ξν)/2≡¯ξ0/2 +i¯LA(¯ξ)/2(216)
= ¯ρA(0)ei¯LA(¯ξ). (217)
TheO(G0)term of the RT formula is

µ,ν∈S|¯LA((¯ξµ=1,¯ξν=1))|2

+O(G2). (226)
As seen from the previous section with Eqs. 214-215, the
first term is O(G0)and the second is O(G1), which be-
comeO(G−1)andthesecondis O(G0)intheusualrenor-
malized convention used in CFT and string theory.
We take the holographic area to be proportional to
ℏGas discussed in Section G and adapt the argument23
motivated in Appendix G for the Airy function to this
situation: smaller holographic areas maker higher-order
terms dominate semiclassical expansions. This suggests
that we interpret the O(G0)≡ O(ℏ0G0)term (where
we have included the redundant ℏdependence) as corre-
sponding to the entropy of the young black hole in AdS
when it is large, and the O(G1)≡ O(ℏ1G1)term as cor-
responding to the entropy of the intermediate-age black
hole after it has evaporated off some of its initial area.
Notice that, unlike for the Airy function, there is no
higher O(ℏ2)orO(G2)term here to perform a uni-
formization. This means that the area of the black hole
does not change after intermediate evolution. For AdS 3,
thermodynamicallystablelarge(BTZ)blackholesdonot
evaporate away, so this makes sense. (They still radiate
and initially shrink, but the open boundary conditions
also bathe them in their own radiation leading them to
a thermodynamically eternally radiating state [21, 22].)
Moreover, this result captures the correct behavior of
small black holes in AdS, which evaporate away but
whose entanglement entropy never reaches the later de-
creasing part of the Page curve.
Thissuggeststhatthoughstabilizerstatecontextuality
producesblackholes,thermodynamicallystable radiating
black holes require something more to evaporate away.
We will see that this is still true with O(ℏ1)quantum
magic states since they do not affect the AdS 3symmetry
of spacetime.
3. RT Applied to Quantum Magic States
Consider the quantum magic state ρA= (¯ξ0+ (¯ξi¯ξj+
¯ξj¯ξk)/√
2)/2(see Appendix D for their derivation). This
has the dual AdS element
¯ρA=(¯ξ0+ (¯ξµ¯ξν+¯ξµ¯ξρ)/√
2)/2.(227)
≡¯ξ0/2 +i¯LA(¯ξ)/2. (228)
Given the similar form, the entanglement entropy of
this state can be expressed similarly to the one found for
the stabilizer state in the previous section,
S(ρA) =−¯ρA(0)
log ¯ρA(0)−G
2X
µ,ν∈S|LA((¯ξµ=1,¯ξν=1))|2

+O(G2). (229)
The value of this entanglement entropy is equal to the
one found for the stabilizer state. However, it contains
twoO(G1)terms compared to the one for the stabilizer
state. (In general, as long as BQP ̸=BPP, the num-
ber of these terms will increase exponentially with the
number of qubits.)
This reveals that while the dual of this state is a black
hole with more terms required to express its isometries,
it is still eternal (i.e. its area does not decrease after in-
termediate times) since it does not possess higher order
O(ℏ2)orO(G2)terms.4. RT Applied to Gravity Magic States in Perturbed AdS 3
Now we consider the state corresponding to the fourth
isometry ξ′′
2inEq.197-202afterthe O(G)transformation
defined in Section I and write it in the even Clifford
algebra Cl 3,0(C)representation:
ˆξ′′
1ˆξ′′
3=ˆξ1ˆξ3+Gδτℏ2ˆξ0+O(δτ2).(230)
The corresponding “gravitational” magic state is
¯ρA(¯ξ) =(¯ξ0+¯ξ4¯ξ6+Gδτℏ2¯ξ0)/2 +O(δτ2),(231)
It follows that
¯ρA(0) = 
1 +Gδτℏ2
/2 +O(δτ2).(232)
but otherwise the state is the same as a stabilizer state
or quantum magic state: ¯ρ(¯ξ) = ¯ρA(0)eiLA(¯ξ).
Given that the O(G)transformation is performed in
the larger algebra Cl 4,0(C)(though we are restricting
ourselves to its Cl[0]
4,0(C)subalgebra, as discussed in Sec-
tion I), the terms in the OPE depend on both the ℏ
andGparameters (i.e. the OPE is no longer conformal
and they are no longer equivalent expansion parameters).
Hence, the terms that were formerly found to be O(ℏj)
orO(Gj)now become O(ℏjGj).
Given the dual AdS ¯ρ(¯ξ)state’s similarity to a stabi-
lizer state or magic state, its entanglement entropy will
contain a term that scales as O(ℏ0G0)andO(ℏ1G1)like
before for the stabilizer and magic states. However, there
will also now be a term that scales as O(ℏ2G1)due to the
additional ℏ2G-dependent term in ¯ρA(0).
This changes the former leading order term for the
entanglement entropy S(ρA)to be
−Z
¯ρA(¯ξ) log ¯ρA(¯ξ)¯ξ4¯ξ5¯ξ6¯ξ7d4¯ξ
=−log2(¯ρA(0))¯ρA(0) (233)
=−log2((1 + Gδτℏ2)/2)(1 + Gδτℏ2)/2(234)
=1/2 +G(1−log−1(2))δτℏ2/2 +O(δτ2),(235)
where log−1(2)is an (inverse) natural logarithm (to base
e). This means that the leading order term now contains
bothaO(ℏ0G0)andO(ℏ2G1)term for any finite rotation
δτthat produces a gravitational magic state. Note that
1−log−1(2)<0, and so the O(ℏ2G1)term has opposite
sign compared to O(ℏ0G0)term.
The remaining O(ℏ0G0)sub-leading term is
G
2X
µ,ν∈S|LA((¯ξµ= 1,¯ξν= 1))|2=G
2.(236)24
Adding everything together produces
S(¯ρA) =1/2 +G(1−log−1(2))δτℏ2/2√
2(237)
+G
2X
µ,ν∈S|LA((¯ξµ= 1,¯ξν= 1))|2
+O(δτ2)
≡O(ℏ0G0) +O(ℏ2G1) +O(ℏ1G1)(238)
+O(δτ2).
As the black hole area—proportional to ℏGin three-
dimensional spacetime—reduces due to evaporation, its
entropy S(¯ρA)is dominated by the first O(ℏ0G0)term
when the black hole is young and the O(ℏ0G0) +
O(ℏ2G1) +O(ℏ1G1)terms when it is old. Since the sec-
ond term has opposite sign to the other two, if the third
term preceeds the second term in dominance, this pro-
duces values for the entanglement entropy that follow the
Page curve, sketched in Figure 8. We discuss how this is
similar to the quantum extremal surface prescription in
Appendix H.
FIG. 8. Page curve for (radiating) black holes in perturbed
AdS 3if theO(ℏ2G1)term is treated as the sub-sub-leading
term. See Appendix G for an explanation of what the bot-
tom part refers to (i.e. semiclassical uniformization). A re-
minder that (as found in Section D) in quantum field the-
ory bosonic fields are often implicitly normalized by ℏand in
string theory fields are often implicitly normalized by G, and
so the three terms above become O(ℏ−1G−1),O(ℏ0G0), and
O(ℏ1G0), from left-to-right.K. Irreversibility of Evolution
Consider the reversal of dynamics w.r.t. λ,
−d(iξk)
dλ=− 
−iℏ
2H⃗∂
∂(−iξi)!
=−iH⃗∂
∂(iξi),(239)
where reversal is performed by flipping the sign of the
momentum analog −iξjof the real Grassmann degree of
freedom (as we found in Section C2) and complex conju-
gating. This is clearly distinguishable from the forward
evolution,d(iξk)
dλ=H⃗∂
∂(iξi), buta priori there is no rea-
son that dynamics should run with increasing λinstead
of decreasing λ, or vice-versa; dynamics in the λdegree
of freedom is reversible.
We established the central charge operator of the Ma-
jorana mapping in Section E2. We have also related
this mapping to a representation of a double cover of
SO+(2,2)/SO+(1,2), which is the symmetry group of
two-dimensional conformal transformations. Thus, we
might expect that the property of an irreversible renor-
malization group of two-dimensional conformal field the-
ories holds here as well.
Specifically, for coupling constant ℏ, per the c-
theorem [54], we search for a function c(α)≥0with
coupling constant αsuch that
dc(α)
dλ≤0, (240)
where critical fixed points (stationary points) saturate
the above equality and are found at values of the cen-
tral charge cthat correspond to the (scaled) coefficient
of the second term in the Virasoro algebra relations in
Eq. 119 [54].
Since we know that we have two critical values for the
central charge— c= 0when we get the Clifford algebra
Cl3,0(C)without a well-defined Fourier association be-
tween its even and odd terms, and c= 1/2when we do
have a well-defined ℏ= 2Fourier association whose as-
sociated multiplication rules we can use to extend the
quaternion algebra to the octonion algebra O—we can
identify our coupling constant α≡ℏand find
dc(ℏ)
dλ=ℏ(ℏ−1/2)df(λ)
dλ+O(ℏ2), c(0) = 0 , c(2) = 1 /2,
=⇒c(ℏ) =ℏ(ℏ−1/2)f(λ) +ℏ/4 +O(ℏ2),(241)
where f(λ)is some function of λindependent of ℏ. Ex-
pressing this equation to O(ℏ2)is sufficient for our pur-
poses here.
(As we noted in Section E2, though we frequently
have not set ℏ= 2in prior Sections and simply leave
it asℏ>0, this is merely to allow for easier explana-
tion when lower O(ℏ)terms (such as in OPE series ex-
pansions) dominate because the symplectic area ∆3(see
Eq.87)isfarlargerthan ℏsothat ℏiseffectivelya“small”
but still a fixed constant, or vice-versa when higher O(ℏ)
terms dominate.)25
The c-theorem states that evolution w.r.t ℏis irre-
versible and must occur in the direction of increasing
ℏ, since it is the coupling constant of (an irreversible)
two-dimensional RG flow. Increasing ℏcorresponds to
reverse RG flow. Forward evolution must be associated
with the reverseRG flow since the forward process is dis-
sipative [54] since the number of degrees of freedom de-
creases; evolution in the opposite direction would mean
that information would actually be lost as the physical
properties from prior value of ℏwould be unrecoverable
from the present ℏvalue’s fewer degrees of freedom.
This theorem agrees with our construction: for ℏ= 0
our monomorphism from Cl[0]
3,0(C)to Cl 3,0(C)is unde-
fined and our theory is thus defined over the full uncon-
strained Cl 3,0(C)algebra. For ℏ= 2, the monomorphism
means that we are effectively dealing with fewer degrees
of freedom encapsulated by the smaller Cl[0]
3,0(C)subalge-
bra of Cl 3,0(C).
In other words, for the case of black hole evolution
in AdS 3, theO(ℏ0)term (or equivalently the dual O(G0)
term) of the RT formula is associated with Cl 3,0(C)while
theO(ℏ1)term (or equivalently the dual O(G1)term) is
associated with Cl[0]
3,0(C).
Therefore, even if evolution in λreverses for a given
value of ℏ, it is not necessarily related to evolution at
a “prior” smaller value of ℏby a sign, since it is now
potentially dealing with a higher number of O(ℏ)terms.
For instance, in the case of evaporating black holes, we
see that the dynamics of evaporation must progress along
increasing ℏ.
This suggests that evolution is irreversible when λ
andℏ—which become dimensionful conjugates of each
other in any continuous theory (corresponding to time
and action, respectively)—are considered together as a
parameterization of evolution. The c-function given by
Eq. 241 captures how they should perhaps be considered
together. Heuristically, this suggests that the direction
of the “arrow of time” must lie along ℏ, and therefore is
not sign agnostic.
The situation changes for perturbed AdS 3. The O(G)
transformation acts on the largest Cl 4,0(C)algebra and
increases the size of relevant algebra from the Cl 2,0(C)
subalgebra of Cl[0]
4,0(C)to the full Cl[0]
4,0(C)algebra, which
is no longer canonically isomorphic to a subgroup of
Cl3,0(C). This means that its resultant OPE is not
equivalent to the Virasoro algebra and as a result the
c-theorem no longer holds.
However, its O(ℏ0G0)andO(ℏ1G1)terms (multiply-
ing together the dual ℏandGorders) that are associated
with the increasing Page curve are still fully supported
in Cl 3,0(C), while the O(ℏ2G1)term associated with the
decreasing Page curve is not. This interestingly paral-
lels the derivation of the Page curve (see Appendix F),
wherein the increasing Page curve is due to quantum uni-
taritywhilethedecreasingPagecurveisduetoathermo-
dynamicargument. Thissuggeststhatthe O(ℏ2G1)term
associated with information escape through a wormholemechanism is probabilistic and can occur at any point in
the evolution after the formation of the black hole (the
O(hbar0G0)term).
L. Discussion
Conformal field theories have often been applied to
holographic systems corresponding to continuum quan-
tum field theories without a clear notion of qubits (or
qudits) by taking a continuum limit over algebraic gener-
ators (or modes): ξi→ξx=ξ(x). As we have seen, keep-
ingisupported over a finite discrete set {ξi}ithrough a
Majorana mapping proved key to produce operator prod-
uct expansion that is equivalent to the Virasoro alge-
bra commutation relations and thereby satisfy the holo-
graphic principle.
While many finite Nagreements have been found with
the AdS/CFT correspondence [1, 12, 13, 55], they are
mostly defined by string (or M-)theories that produce
compactified spacetimes with corresponding boundary
CFTs with continuous degrees of freedom. The corre-
spondence we demonstrate here requires no such depen-
dence on string theory and is based on a finite number of
algebraic generators. Other efforts have also used mod-
els that are not directly related to string theories to ex-
plain gravitational phenomena [56–58]. Perhaps the re-
sults here will help unify these efforts.
Nevertheless, there is a notion of compactified degrees
of freedom in the theory presented here related to the
larger dimensional embedding spacetime expressed by
the non-quaternion elements of the octonion elements.
We found that O(G1)transformations in these “hid-
den” degreesoffreedomdeterminewhethertheembedded
spacetime is AdS 3or perturbed AdS 3.
We have found that the AdS 3isometry/qubit corre-
spondence at the heart of the AdS 3/CFT 2correspon-
dence inherently defines the octonion algebra when it is
treated as a homogeneous symmetric space. This oc-
tonionic theory treats gravity in AdS spacetime as an
emergent phenomenon exhibiting a conformal anomaly
(similar to contextuality or non-classicality). Similar re-
lationships to non-classical properties have been postu-
lated elsewhere [59, 60].
Therefore, a fundamental relationship we have estab-
lished here is that the ubiquity of the central charge
anomaly in quantum mechanics can be directly related to
the ubiquity of singularities within general curved space-
times. This means that, in the dual sense, the double
cover property of qubits in SU (2)is equivalent to the
ubiquitous presence of black holes in general relativity
spacetimes.
In terms of practical application, we note that the
strong/weak duality between the ℏ-dependent formula-
tion in Cl 3,0(C)and the G-dependent formulation in
Cl[0]
4,0(C)does not seem to seem to lead to a practi-
cally useful easier solution in the strong-coupling limit
using the G-dependent formulation, as has been found in26
casesofthecontinuouscorrespondenceincondensedmat-
ter [61] and high-energy [62]. This is because the strong
“coupling” means that ℏ→ ∞, which is not meaning-
fully related to coupling between qubits but rather cou-
pling between Majoranas. As we found in Section H, the
quantum strong coupling limit of ℏ→ ∞is equivalent
toG→0and makes the dual equations of motion be-
come uncoupled. Such uncoupled equations necessarily
correspond to maximally mixed state dynamics.
In terms of predictive capability, this theory is as pre-
dictiveasquantummechanics. Inparticular, asdiscussed
in Section G, much like any quantum mechanical process
can be written as a finite series of O(ℏ1)terms, so can
anyquantumgravitationalprocessintheoctoniontheory
be written in a finite series of O(ℏ1G1)terms.
In terms of novel predictions made in this paper, the
most significant of course are the O(G1)mechanistic res-
olution to the black hole information paradox related to
wormhole formation. There are also unexplored conse-
quences from “back-action” effects when O(Gℏ)trans-
formations of the G-quantized generators act on the ℏ-
quantized generators or vice-versa (i.e. spacetime-matter
interactions). We leave these for future work.
Perhaps the most pressing future direction of study
is the extension of this theory to more than one qubit.
Naively, adding more qubits adds exponentially more
units of ℏGin this phase space. Tracing out degrees
of freedom in calculations of the entanglement entropy
would produce the particular profile of the Page curve
for a given subsystem.
M. Conclusion
There is much to be said about the AdS/CFT cor-
respondence and its validity in various regimes as well
as the approximative and conjectural nature of its “dic-
tionary”. Here we have provided an explicit non-
approximative octonionic theory of quantum gravity that
relates generally non-pure quantum states with gravi-
tationally curved spacetime. We have shown how the
presence of the ubiquitous central charge anomaly leads
to the development of this theory as a superalgebra
generalization of algebras defined through ℏ- and G-
quantization. The result reveals how intimately linked
the central charge anomaly is to the ubiquity of singular-
ities in curved spacetime. We then offered a resolution
of the information paradox from black hole radiation by
showing that old radiative black holes in perturbed AdS 3
produce O(ℏ2G1)wormholes.
We summarize the concepts that we have found arevery closely related in this formalism:
•qubit contextuality, central charge anomaly, and
supersymmetry,
•the qubit holographic principle, symplectic area
conservation, and unitarity,
•RG fixed critical points, central charge critical
points, and operator product expansion terms
(semiclassical expansion orders),
•the two-dimensional renormalization group, central
charge as a running coupling, and the irreversibility
of evolution,
•uniformization and wormholes,
We found that the quaternion subalgebra of the octonion
algebra emergently defines an AdS 3spacetime on an em-
bedding space.
As we discussed, the octonion algebra can be viewed
as built up from progressively larger normed division
algebras, wherein each step removes a property. (The
complex algebra loses trivial involution, the quaternion
algebra loses commutativity, the octonion algebra loses
associativity.) Extending the octonion algebra further
necessarily introduces zero divisors and produces a non-
normed algebra. The fact that it is not possible to ex-
tend this theory further without losing normalizability
suggests that it is in that sense complete. There are im-
pressive results formulating the Standard Model in terms
of the octonion algebra [50, 63–67], which if joined to-
gether with the quantum gravity theory presented here,
suggests that it is an excellent candidate for a unified
theory of physics.

Appendix A: Algebraic Preliminaries of Pauli
Algebra Cl 3,0(R)as Classical Canonical Variables
We define ξ1,ξ2andξ3to be three real generators of
the Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(C)with identity ξ0, which is
isomorphic to the Pauli algebra. This means that the
maximal monomial power of this algebra is three.
Anyelement g∈Cl3,0(C)canberepresentedasafinite
sum of homogeneous monomials consisting of these three
generators:
g(ξ) =g0ξ0+3X
i=1giξi+3X
i,j=1gijξiξj+3X
i,j,k=1gijkξiξjξk.
(A1)
We define an involution operation that is analogous to
complex conjugation:
(g∗)∗=g, (αg)∗=α∗g∗, (A2)
where α∈C.
An element g∈Cl3,0(C)is real if g∗=g. Since the
generators are defined to be real ( ξ∗
i=ξi),gis real if and
only if the coefficients of its polynomials are real.
Since this is an exterior algebra, polynomials of Grass-
mann generators serve as sufficient building blocks to de-
fine all operations on it. Moreover, since this algebra
has an associated topology (discussed in Section B) that
possesses a compact subspace and connectedness, the op-
eration of integration can be defined. Since ξ2
i= 0, inte-
gration needs to be defined a little differently compared
to other normed algebras, such as the real or complex
numbers. Integration is defined to satisfy
Z
ξ0dξi= 0,Z
ξidξi= 1. (A3)This means that
Z
ξk1ξk2ξk3dξ3dξ2dξ1=ϵk1k2k3,(A4)
and
Z
g(ξ)d3ξ=X
kϵk1k2k3gk1k2k3,(A5)
where ϵk1k2k3is the Levi-Civita tensor.
This definition is perhaps non-intuitive since we have
framed it as an indefinite integration by not putting lim-
itsontheintegralsymbols, andfromourintuitiondealing
with regular calculus on other algebras we expect indefi-
nite integration to raise the power of polynomials instead
of lowering them. Nevertheless, this definition is a topo-
logical generalization and can also be justified by its con-
sequences [68], which is to say that it could be considered
to be an operation that we are calling “integration” be-
cause we will see that we can write a Grassmann version
of Fourier transforms, exponential integrals, Gaussian in-
tegrals, etc., in a manner equivalent to other algebras in
terms of this integration operation. In fact, it is perhaps
more intuitive to consider this definition of Grassmann
integration as a definiteintegral over the full (curiously
unspecified) domain (like −∞to∞for the real algebra).
Due to the anti-commutation relation between Grass-
mann generators, derivatives can be defined as the fol-
lowing left- and right-handed operations:
⃗∂ξiξk1···ξkm=δk1i···ξkm−δk2iξk1ξk3···ξkm
+. . .+ (−1)mδkmiξk1···ξkm−1,(A6)
and
ξk1···ξkm⃗∂ξi=δkmiξk1···ξkm−1−δkm−1iξk1···ξkm−2ξkm
+. . .+ (−1)mδk1iξk2···ξkm.(A7)
Again, this is chosen due to a posteriori reasons, most
notably that it allows for a similar Grassmann version of
a Taylor series expansion of any element g∈Cl3,0(C):
g(ξ) =g(0)ξ0+3X
i=1⃗∂ξig(ξ)|ξ=0ξi (A8)
+3X
i,j=1⃗∂2
ξi,ξjg(ξ)|ξ=0ξiξj+3X
i,j,k=1⃗∂3
ξi,ξj,ξkg(ξ)|ξ=0ξiξjξk.
This is very useful, as it will allow for the definition of
Grassmann versions of the exponential function
exp(g(ξ))≡ξ0+∞X
n=1(n!)−1gn(ξ),(A9)
and the logarithm function,
log(−ξ0+g(x))≡ −∞X
n=1n−1gn(ξ),(A10)30
which will turn out to satisfy the expected usual proper-
ties. The Grassmann exponential function can even be
used to define a Grassmann version of the delta function
when paired with Grassmann integration:
iZ
exp(i3X
j=1ρkξk)d3ρ=ξ1ξ2ξ3≡δ(ξ1)δ(ξ2)δ(ξ3),
(A11)
since
Z
g(ξ)ξ1ξ2ξ3d3ξ=g(0). (A12)
Note that ρjare also Grassmann elements, and should
be considered to be an extension of the ξjGrassmann
elements; ξjandρjanti-commute.
Notice that the definitions for Grassmann integration
does not have an intuitive or formal “anti-derivative”
property.
As alluded to, these definitions allow us to define a
Grassmann Gaussian integral as
Z
eP3
i,j=1aijξiξjd3ξ=pf(2aij) =q
det(2 aij),(A13)
where aij=−ajiand pf (A)is the Pfaffian of matrix A
– the determinant of a skew-symmetric matrix is equal
to the square of a polynomial of its elements. Notice
thatthisresultproducesadeterminantinthenumerator,
instead of the denominator as for the real algebra.
ForA=
0 a12a23
−a12 0a23
−a23−a130
, pf(A) = 0, and
in general the Pfaffian is only non-vanishing for even-
dimensional square matrices.
These definitions for integration and derivative in the
Grassmann Gnalgebra are sometimes called the Berezin
calculus [69].
The definition for differentiation given by Eqs. A6-A7
allows for a “Poisson bracket” to be defined:
iX
j 
ξk⃗∂
∂ξj! ⃗∂
∂ξjξl!
≡ {ξk, ξl}P.B.=iδkl.(A14)
In this way, the Grassmann generators can be treated
as conjugate classical canonical variables. However, to
ascribeanevolution(fromaHamiltonian)tothesecanon-
ical variables, we will want to ensure that any such evo-
lution satisfies the expected quantum evolution under
quantization.
Appendix B: Action
GivenanyrealquadraticHamiltonian H, anassociated
symplectic matrix can be produced from exponentiation,
Eij(λ) = exp 
iℏ
2H⃗∂2
∂ξi∂ξjλ!
, (B1)which determines the evolution for all λ:
ξ′=E(λ)ξ. (B2)
However, this is not a complete map between symmet-
ric matrices (i.e. quadratic Hamiltonians) and symplectic
matrices [44].
A more useful definition can be made by associating
a symplectic matrix Ewith an antisymmetric matrix A
through the Cayley parameterization,
E= (A−iI)(A+iI)−1. (B3)
ForEgiven by Eq. B1,
Ajk=X
iϵijkbk
|b|tan(|b|t/2). (B4)
We can identify this as the quadratic part of the usual
generating action
S(ξ;t) =X
jkAjkξjξk, (B5)
which generates translations,
ξ′
i=ξi−ℏ
4S⃗∂ξi. (B6)
This is easy to verify by substituting the definition of S
(Eq. B5) into this equation and obtaining Eq. B2. This
is the action Sthat we will associate with a given La-
grangian L.
The action can also be seen in the general qubit uni-
tary [70]:
ˆU(ξ, t) = cos( bt/2) exp
−2i
ℏX
k,l,mϵklmbk
btan(bt/2)ˆξlˆξm
.
(B7)
We can identify the generating action (Eq. B5) in the ex-
ponentscaledby ℏanditssecondderivativeintheoverall
prefactor. This identifies this expression as a O(ℏ1)ex-
pansion of a full Feynman path integral [70]. This agrees
with our finding that anyqubit quantum evolution can
be represented by a quadratic Grassmann Hamiltonian
H=−i

are generically O(ℏ). Upon quantization, we must set
ℏ= 2to produce the conventional relationship to Pauli
matrices.
Appendix C: The Clifford Stabilizer Subtheory,
Contextuality, and Relationship to Central Charge
1. The Clifford Stabilizer Subtheory
Note that the Clifford stabilizer subtheory is unrelated
to the Clifford algebras.31
We begin by defining the Pauli algebra in the tradi-
tional manner with respect to Pauli operators and then
proceed to define the Clifford stabilizer subtheory.
We define Pauli operators to be the basis of SU (2),
which is three-dimensional as a real manifold. One
common representation is ˆσ0≡
1 0
0 1
,ˆσ1≡ˆσx=

0 1
1 0
,ˆσ2≡ˆσz=
1 0
0−1
, and ˆσ3≡ˆσy=iˆσxˆσz.
Note that {ˆσi,ˆσj}=δijσ0. We define the Pauli group
Pnto consist of ntensor products of Paulis operators
multiplied by ±1.
Stabilizer states |ψ⟩onn-qubits are defined by n
(non-unique) generating commuting Pauli group ele-
ments {ˆPi}n
i=1such that ˆPi|ψ⟩=|ψ⟩. Thus, every n-
qubit stabilizer state can be equivalently represented by
ncommuting Pauli operators. This is the operational
representation of stabilizer states called the Heisenberg
representation [71].
The Clifford group Cnconsists of the Pauli group Pn
and unitary operators that take Pauli group elements to
themselves. This means that Clifford unitaries take sta-
bilizer states to other stabilizer states.
Pauli group elements are also closed under themselves,
and so are trivially a subgroup of the Clifford group.
SincestabilizerstatesareuniteigenvectorsofPauligroup
elements, it follows that Pauli measurements also take
stabilizer states to other stabilizer states.
Adding Pauli measurements to the Clifford group and
restricting initial states to be stabilizer states produces a
complete quantum subtheory consisting of initial states,
a unitary gateset, and measurements. This subtheory of
the full quantum theory is called the Clifford stabilizer
subtheory.
We have only discussed the Clifford stabilizer subthe-
ory for two-dimensional systems, but a similar construc-
tion can be made in odd- and infinite-dimensions [70].
However, a difference exists between the two-dimensional
theory and these others, which is that the qubit Clifford
stabilizer subtheory exhibits quantum contextuality .
2. Contextuality
Examiningdimension-dependentpropertiesoftheClif-
ford stabilizer subtheory is a useful alternative way of
characterizing the central charge anomaly in the com-
plexified Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(C)when mapped under
theℏ-dependent monomorphism to the Pauli algebra
Cl3,0(R). In particular, qubits (two-dimensional Hilbert
spaces) exhibit the unique property that they require
non-classical anomalous terms in their operator prod-
uct expansions in order to express the Clifford stabilizer
subtheory of quantum theory. This phenomenon can be
equivalently referred to as quantum contextuality. We
will define this subtheory and contextuality here, and
elaborate on this equivalence.This is in contrast to the Clifford subtheory for odd-
dimensional qudits and the harmonic Gaussian sub-
theory for infinite-dimensional systems, which are non-
contextual. As we shall see here, contextuality generally
indicates non-classicality, so this difference is often cited
as peculiar since both subtheories are equally classically
computationally simulable (as per the Gottesman-Knill
theorem [72]).
Contextuality is defined to exist if, given a set of mea-
surements on a state, their measurement outcomes de-
pend on which independent set is measured first [73–75].
More formally, this is the definition of state-independent
measurement contextuality, but it will suffice for us. It
is a uniquely quantum phenomenon, and is a necessary
(though not sufficient) resource for universal quantum
computation.
Contextuality is perhaps best introduced through an
example. WechoosethePeres-Merminsquare[75], which
consists of four Pauli measurements on two qubits: XI,
IZ,IX, and ZI. The can be divided into two mutu-
ally anti-commuting sets consisting of commuting mea-
surements. These are given by the rows and columns of
Table I.

TABLE I. The Peres-Mermin square.
The outcomes of these measurements are ±1. Regard-
lessofthegivenstateonthetwoqubits, themeasurement
outcomes of the measurements in any row or column are
independent of each other since they commute. Further-
more, it follows that the outcome of the third element in
the row or column is known given the outcomes of the
first two, since they are separable and multiply together
to form the third.
It is easy to show that given a measurement on XI,
whether a subsequent measurement on ZIproduces out-
comes ±1will depend on whether IZorIXis measured
first. In other words, the measurement outcome of ZI
depends on which independent set is measured first: the
top-most row or the left-most column. In this way, the
context of the measurement on ZIaffects its outcome.
This contextuality can be made algebraically apparent
in the Peres-Mermin square by noticing that the sign of
the final Y Yproduct of the third elements depends on
whetheritisobtainedfrommultiplyingtogetherthethird
column or row.
Since all these measurement operators are Paulis,
which are in the Clifford stabilizer subtheory, the Peres-
Mermin square construction demonstrates that the qubit
Clifford stabilizer subtheory exhibits contextuality re-
gardless of the state measured.
Wewillsoonseethatthisstate-independentcontextual
property of the qubit Clifford subtheory is related to the
ubiquitous singularities that are present in curved space-32
time when we extend a quantum formalism described by
the Paulis (the quaternion algebra) to the full octonion
algebra.
3. Clifford Subtheory Captured at O(ℏ1)
We have now established a well-defined mapping be-
tween the Majorana fermions that produce the Clifford
algebra Cl 3,0(C)and the Hilbert space of a (generally
non-pure) qubit. In particular, the map can be expressed
through the ˆToperator mapping given by Eq. 78. This
mappingisveryusefulbecauseitallowsustoformallyin-
troduce a convergent OPE finite-term series expansions
in terms of a parameter ℏ. We have also interspersed
the last few sections with demonstrations that this is
also technically possible to do strictly working in Hilbert
space without the Majorana mapping, but is far less nat-
ural as the parameter ℏis really only defined w.r.t. the
quantization of the Clifford algebra Cl 3,0(C).
As we discussed in Section C1, the Clifford stabilizer
subtheory is defined to contain the closed set of Clifford
unitary gates with final Pauli measurements, both act-
ing on initial stabilizer states. Clifford gates are defined
to consist of all unitaries that take stabilizer states to
themselves. As we mentioned in Section C2, they have
corresponding (quadratic) Hamiltonians in the Cl 3,0(C)
algebraandperiodsofevolution λsuchthattheytakethe
elements of Cl[0]
3,0(C)to themselves. We found that this
means that their overall ℏdependence can be factored
out and this procedure can be handled at order ℏ0.
On the other hand, this ceases to be true for multi-
qubit Pauli measurements. This is shown in detail for
the Clifford algebra Cl[0]
3,0(C)in [41], and we will only
summarize the main point by saying that relative phases
±ibecome important between commuting sets of Paulis
in the Heisenberg representation. Since all Pauli multi-
plication rules can be performed at order ℏ1if both ele-
mentsinCl[0]
3,0(C)andtheirGrassmannFouriertransform
in Cl[1]
3,0(C)are calculated as in Eq. 108, this means that
the overall Clifford stabilizer subtheory can be captured
atorder ℏ1withintheCliffordalgebra(withasingleterm
for a single qubit).
There is nothing fundamentally non-classical about
tracking a distribution or its characteristic Fourier trans-
formation. However, the necessity of using the Fourier
transform after Pauli measurements to determine how
to update the probability distribution Cl[0]
3,0(C)from its
dual Cl[1]
3,0(C)(or vice-versa) isnon-classical as they
are related by a global Fourier transformation. This
is a non-classical update rule (incompatible with Kol-
mogorov’s axioms for classical probability distribution
update rules [42], for instance), but it is still classically
efficiently simulable.
The importance of the Fourier transform’s imaginary
number can also be found in the well-known efficient
tableau algorithm for classically simulating the qubit

theories. i= 1, j= 2, k= 3andµ= 4, ν= 5, ρ= 6, σ= 7,

Clifford stabilizer subtheory. Therein, calculating the
“parity bit” requires mod 4arithmetic [72] for rowsum’s
update of the phase, whereas for the odd-dimensional
case, mod parithmetic suffices [70].
This is in contrast to the odd- and infinite-dimensional
case, wheresimilarformalismsareabletoaccomplishthis
atO(ℏ0)with only the equivalent of the even subalge-
bra [70].
Note that this means that the Grassmann Fourier
transform is itself an O(ℏ)operation. We have thus
almost established ℏto be a dimensionless analogue to
Planck’s constant. But we refrain from declaring it so
until we do a bit more work.
A sketch of the dual elements of the full theory can be
found in Figure 9. As we have seen, expressing every-

algebra elements’ role in the full theory.
4. Interpretation
We make a small digression in this section. In partic-
ular, we will examine how the qubit Clifford stabilizer
subtheory’s contextuality, apparent in the Cl 3,0(C)alge-
bra with its Ω(ℏ1)description, can be fundamentally at-
tributedtothepropertythatdefiningaclassicalprobabil-
ity space commensurate with qubit stabilizer states must
be double-covered if they are to describe Pauli measure-33
ment outcomes properly. This double-covering manifests
itself in the Clifford algebra through the superpartners
that must both be tracked. This alternative perspective
on the omnipresence of contextuality in quantum theory
offers us the first hint of the AdS black hole geometry
that we will soon formalize: doubly-covered spaces are
particularly well-suited to minimally express particle and
anti-particle creation or dynamics across null-separated
distancesofspacetime(i.e.acrosseventhorizons)because
they naturally possess supersymmetric formulations that
provide superpartners for this task.
Single-qubit stabilizer states, which are are eigenstates
of the Paulis, exhibit a quaternion (SU (2)) topology un-
der unitary evolution and Pauli measurements. This
means that a classical probability theory with an event
space (defining a topological space) consisting of the sta-
bilizer states must be doubly larger than the classically
natural SO (3)group structure. Elements in Cl[0]
3,0(C)cor-
responding to stabilizer states have non-negative real co-
efficients and so can be interpreted as (classical) proba-
bility distributions [41]. A doubly-covered space still al-
lows for classical probability theories, with non-negative
real-valued probability distributions and positive state-
independent maps, but the double cover may require
tracking which “cover” is indicated (more precisely, which
cover is indicated for one qubit relative to another
since (measurement) contextuality requires more than
one qubit). For the non-unitary SL (2,R)group, this
is also true but with regards to the double cover of
SO+(2,2)/SO+(1,2). In terms of Cl 3,0(C), this mani-
fests itself in the requirement to track the probability
distribution and dual characteristic function. We make
this clearer shortly.
Overlaps between probability functions and their char-
acteristic function necessarily require introducing the
imaginary constant in intermediate arithmetic, even
though the final result is real. This is because such dual
functions are related by a Fourier transform, which is
necessarily a function in complex space. As we showed in
Section C3, the Fourier transform is a O(ℏ)transforma-
tion. Together the Weyl symbols and their duals serve as
a double-cover of the two-dimensional Clifford group, un-
liketheodd-orinfinite-dimensionalCliffordgroup, which
necessitates introducing the imaginary constant.
More precisely, in the three-generator formalism, the
presence of the double cover can be found in the Clif-
ford subtheory by noting that since stabilizer states have
non-negative real coefficients in their Cl[0]
3,0(C)subalge-
bra, it follows that their coefficients in Cl[1]
3,0(C)are all
imaginary. Hence we can restrict to only looking at the
unsigned elements of Cl[0]
3,0(R)
{ξ0} ⊕ { ξpξq, ξqξp, ξpξr, ξrξp, ξqξr, ξrξq},(C1)
and when considering their Grassmann Fourier elements
we can just look at unsigned elements of i×Cl[1]
3,0(R)
{iξpξqξr, iξqξpξr} ⊕ { iξp, iξq, iξr},(C2)where we organized the elements by their common grade.
For single-qubit states (projectors), which consist of a
linear combination of the left- and right-hand elements
in the equations above, the elements in Cl[0](R)only
track the sign of the right-hand-side elements through
their anti-commuting order and the elements in Cl[1](R)
only track the sign of the left-hand-side elements. To in-
corporate a global sign, as necessary to calculate Pauli
observable outcomes (but not Clifford unitary evolu-
tion), it is necessary to take their mutual overlaps, which
as we can see above, requires introducing a parity-four
(i.e. signed imaginary number) phase through the Grass-
mann Fourier transform. This tracking of both represen-
tations is equivalent to tracking which cover of a double
cover a state is on.
This is auseful way to characterize thedifferentbehav-
ior of the qubit stabilizer Clifford subtheory compared to
the odd- and infinite-dimensional case because it makes
it clear how the qubit subtheory’s non-classicality is due
to the mathematical quirkiness of its space being double-
covered. This property does not prevent it from being as
efficiently simulatable as the classical odd- and infinite-
dimensional cases since we have shown that it can be
accomplished using the usual efficient classical functions
(i.e. classical probability distributions and their charac-
teristic functions) as long as one permits the use of the
imaginary number with a polynomial number of Θ(ℏ1)
terms. In other words, despite being strictly outside clas-
sical theory, it is intuitively clear that taking overlaps
between classical probability functions and their duals
should be properly contained by universal quantum the-
ory as a non-universal subtheory.
5. The Θ(ℏ0)Qutrit Clifford Stabilizer Theory
As discussed in Appendix C3, rotations between
{ξi}3
i=1∈Cl3,0(C)Grassmann elements correspond to
Clifford operations, which we showed can be described
by anO(ℏ0)refactoring within the Cl 3,0(C). Considering
the full octonion algebra, rotations between {ξµ}7
µ=4∈
Cl4,0(C)Grassmann elements similarly correspond to
O(G0)operations as their Hamiltonians and evolutions
λare equivalent. It is also easy to see that rotations be-
tween the sets {ξi}3
i=1and{ξµ}7
µ=4Grassmann elements
also correspond to O(ℏ0, G0)operations.
This last set of rotations allows us to form the “split
octonion units”:
u0=1
2(ξ0+iξ7) (C3)
uj=1
2(ξj+iξj+3), (C4)
and their complex conjugates, for j={1,2,3}.34
Upon quantization, these satisfy the properties [50, 63]
ˆu2
0=ˆu0, (C5)
ˆu0ˆu∗
0=0, (C6)
ˆu0ˆuj=ˆujˆu∗
0= ˆuj, (C7)
ˆujˆu0=ˆu∗
0ˆuj= 0, (C8)
ˆuiˆuj=ϵijkˆu∗
k, (C9)
ˆujˆu∗
k=−δjkˆu0, (C10)
and the complex-conjugate equations. This means that
these ˆu1,ˆu2,ˆu3(ˆu∗
1,ˆu∗
2,ˆu∗
3) operators are Fermi annihi-
lation (creation) operators of SU (3)andˆu0is the vacuum
state. Their non-associativity means that they have no
matrix representation.
It then follows that we can construct qutrit shift X
and boost Zoperators
ˆX=3X
i=1ˆuiˆu∗
((i−1)⊕1)+1 (C11)
ˆZ=−3X
i=1ωi−1ˆu∗
iˆui, (C12)
where ω≡exp 2 πi/3and⊕indicatesadditionmodulus 3.
These act by “shifting” and “boosting” the computational
basis states:
ˆXˆu∗
iˆu0|0⟩=ˆu∗
i⊕1ˆu0|0⟩, (C13)
ˆZˆu∗
iˆu0|0⟩=ωi−1ˆu∗
iˆu0|0⟩, (C14)
where |0⟩is the ordinary vacuum acted upon by complex
fields. Since they are quadratic operators of ˆui, which
take ˆuito themselves, it follows that their action can be
captured at O(ℏ0)by the Euler-Lagrange equations of
the unquantized Grassmann algebra by factoring out the
ℏdependence, in the same manner as we did for the qubit
Cliffordunitarygates. However, unlikeforthequbitcase,
this can also be done for measurements of these general-
ized Pauli operators as well, by constructing the Weyl-
Heisenberg group H3(Z/3Z)from these shift and boost
operators [27, 70]. This means that the full Clifford sta-
bilizer subtheory can be described non-contextually at
O(ℏ0)using these operators.
Note that ˆXand ˆZhave matrix representations [27];
quadratic products of the non-associative uiproduces
associative operators. Also note again that we would
not have been able to factor out the ℏdependence for
the qutrit Clifford stabilizer subtheory if we had not ex-
pressed the operator product expansion in terms of both
the even and odd elements of Cl 3,0(C)so as to make it
truncate at O(ℏ1).
We deem that we are now justified in associating ℏas
a dimensionless analog to Planck’s constant and we do
so henceforth.
Insummary, wehaveshownthatthefullCliffordstabi-
lizer subtheory for qutrits can be treated at O(ℏ0). This
neatly accords with the non-contextuality of the odd-
dimensional Clifford stabilizer subtheory.Appendix D: Quantum Magic Gates and States
SupplementingtheCliffordstabilizersubtheory—con-
sisting of Clifford gates acting on stabilizer states with
Pauli measurements — with magic states extends the
subtheory to a full quantum implementation [49]. This
is convenient as it allows us to consider only a single ad-
ditional single-qubit gate to sufficiently analyze the full
quantum subtheory.
Quantum Tmagic gates are unitaries defined by the
Hamiltonian
H=−(i/2)ξpξr (D1)
which produces the following Hamilton equations:
d
dλ(ξp, ξqξr) =−ℏ(ξr,0,−ξp)/4.(D2)
When evolved for λ=π/2(by the exponential map)
these produce
ξp→(1−ℏ/4)ξp−ℏξr/4, (D3)
ξq→ξq, (D4)
ξr→(1−ℏ/4)ξr+ℏξp/4. (D5)
The above transformations on ξpandξqcontain two
ℏ-dependent terms. Therefore, the overall evolution is
O(ℏ1)and cannot be reduced through factorization to
beO(ℏ0)like for Clifford unitary evolution. The evolu-
tion is still unitary and so described by a quadratic real
Hamiltonian.
Ingeneral, given BQP ̸=BPP, thesenumberof O(ℏ1)
terms will proliferate exponentially with respect to the
number of qubits. (This is true even if approximating T
gate Pauli measurement outcomes to additive error).
Due to the two ℏ-dependent terms, it is also possible to
consider this T gate evolution as a linear combination of
evolution under two different Clifford Hamiltonians. For
instance, in the above H=−iξ0andH=−iξqξr. We
will see that this perspective proves useful later when we
consider “gravitational” magic gates.
We will also see in Appendix G that these O(ℏ1)
terms cannot be combined (or “uniformized” [76], as this
is called in continuous stationary phase approximation
or steepest descent extensions) into fewer higher O(ℏ2)
terms and that the dual of this explains why large ther-
modynamically stable BTZ black holes in AdS 3space-
time are eternal (i.e. do not evaporate).

AdS dis a maximally symmetric spacetime and so con-
tainn(n+ 1)/2isometries (i.e. Killing vectors). There-
fore, AdS 3has six isometries, Vµ, that it inherits from
its embedding space: K01,K32,K21,K30,J02, and
J13, where K01=t∂x+x∂t,K23=t′∂x′+x′∂t′,
K12=x∂t′+t′∂x,K03=t∂x′+x′∂t,J02=t∂t′−t′∂t,
andJ13=x∂x′−x′∂x. (Expressing AdS 3as a symmetric
space,SO+(1,2)×SO+(1,2)
SO+(1,2), pairs these six isometries into
three isometries.) To find these isometries in the global
coordinates, we need to calculate
χµ=Pν
µVν, (E8)
where Pν
µ=∂Xν
∂Rµis the projection tensor.
Notably, this produces
J02=−l2cosh2(ρ)∂τ, (E9)
and
J13=l2sinh2(ρ)∂ϕ. (E10)
Also, note that the isometry generated by ˆY=ˆξ3=
i(J02+J13), which contains a global factor of i. The
factor of iis important as it will require us to Wick rotate
into imaginary time.
The metric in global coordinates is independent of ϕ
andτ. Therefore, itfollowsthatKillingvectorsexistthat
are coaxial with ∂ϕand∂τ, which indeed we identify with
J02andJ13, respectively. However, the ϕcoordinate is
periodic on [0,2π)while τis defined on the unbounded
interval (−∞,∞). This means that ∂τis also associated
with a Killing horizon since it changes sign at τ= 0.
The global metric of AdS reveals that it is a static
spacetime. Such spacetimes are understood to contain
aneventhorizon Σthatcorrespondstoanasymptotically
timelike Killing vector field (∂τ)µ[77]. Therefore, if we
perform a Wick rotation into imaginary time τ→ −iτ,
then we obtain a Killing horizon from ˆξ3=i(J02+J13).Such a Wick rotation generates a metric that is related

Appendix F: The Information Paradox
We take a moment to give a quick overview of what
is frequently called the black hole information paradox.
This section is meant mainly for non-specialists, for the
sake of completeness. Many more in-depth reviews can
be found elsewhere [80, 81].
BlackholeswereproposedbyBekenstein[82]topossess
an entropy that scales with the area of its event horizon.
Since classically black holes do not radiate, this generally
means that the classical entropy of black holes must be
a non-decreasing function.
However, this characterization changed after Hawk-
ing’s discovery that black holes radiate when quantum
effects are taken into account [51]. Since black holes can
evaporate, their area can decrease, and so according to
Bekenstein’s proposition, black hole entropy should be a
decreasing function. However, Hawking showed that the
total entropy of a black hole consists of a linear com-
bination of the classical Bekenstein term and the semi-
classical Hawking correction from radiation. This latter
contribution from external radiation will be an increasing
function.
Though the precise nature of Hawking radiation is
still undetermined, pairwise entangled modes have been
shown to be a characteristic feature of horizons [52]. One
memberofthepairwillbeinfallingandeventuallyhitthe
singularity. The other can escape to infinity. An external
observer will only measure these external Hawking radi-
ation modes and see a highly mixed final state with large
entropy. This presents a contradiction if the initial state
of the black hole is a pure state, which has zero entropy.
A full quantum mechanical system cannot become mixed
without violating unitarity.
Page argued [80, 81, 83] that this information lost
about the system must eventually escape past the event
horizon and thereby restore the unitarity of the dynam-
ics. As a result, though an evaporating black hole that
starts out as a pure state will have an entropy that fol-
lows Hawking’s increasing curve when it is young since36
FIG. 10. The Page curve which follows Hawking’s bound ini-
tially as the black hole external radiation modes accumulate
and then subsequently follows Bekenstein’s bound to preserve
quantum unitarity. This requires the information entropy
of the matter inside the event horizon to somehow escape,
thereby posing an information paradox.
theentropyoftheexternalradiationwillincreaseasmore
and more modes radiate, when the entropy of the radia-
tion is the same as the entropy of the horizon, its entropy
will subsequently follow Bekenstein’s classical decreasing
bound proportional to the decreasing area of the evapo-
rating black hole (see Figure 10). This means that the
early radiation must in some way purifythe later radia-
tion. Since the event horizon is supposed to present an
inescapable barrier, the lack of mechanism for this to be
accomplished presents an information paradox.
As mentioned, pairwise entangled modes have been
shown to be a characteristic feature of horizons [52].
However, their form prevents them from sharing their
entanglement across the event horizon and resolving the
information paradox [84, 85] without a significant O(1)
contribution. It has also been found that small correla-
tions between early and later Hawking radiation is also
insufficient. It is deemed unlikely that a remnant from
evaporation of Planckian scale could resolve the para-
dox [86].
Appendix G: Area Subtended by Stationary Phase
Points and Uniformization
This section will motivate how higher order ℏterms
in a stationary phase approximation correspond to thecorrect solution when the holographic area subtended by
stationary phase points becomes smaller, as occurs dur-
ing black hole evaporation.
We consider the continuous case of a function with
symmetric stationary phase points around the origin of
the integral [44, 87, 88]:
f(α) =Z∞

tive to be

This solution is only formally correct with the station-
ary phase solutions are far from the energy shell. Other-
wise it diverges.
To handle this case, we can perform a uniformization
by doubling the range of integration so that the two sta-
tionary phase points interact with each other instead of
with the origin [44]:

A similar symplectic area association in Cl 3,0(C)can
be made by using the integral representation of the OPE

full evaluation of line G8.
The argument to the exponential can be rewritten
∆3(ξ,ξ1,ξ2)≡ξ·ξ1+ξ2·ξ+ξ1·ξ2(G12)
=(ξ1−ξ)·(ξ2−ξ), (G13)which can be interpreted as the “area of a triangle” with
midpoints ξ,ξ1andξ2(seeFigure12). Byputtingparen-
theses around “area of a triangle”, we mean the Grass-
mann analog of a signed area associated with a quadratic
exterior product. Here this signed area is Grassmann-
valued.
FIG. 12. The symplectic area associated with ∆3(ξ, ξ1, ξ2)
This means that the O(ℏ0)term has null Grassmann
symplectic area associated with it, while the O(ℏ1)term
has a non-zero Grassmann symplectic area.
Notice that unlike for the continuous-variable Airy
function example, there is no O(ℏ2)term and the two
O(ℏ1)terms cannot be combined (uniformized) to be-
come such a term. We will see that this captures the
property that large thermodynamically stable BTZ black
holes in AdS 3spacetime do not evaporate when we con-
sider the dual AdS OPE.
Appendix H: Quantum Extremal Surfaces
The Ryu-Takayanagi formula was recently extended to
include quantum extremal surfaces χ[9, 53, 89–91]:

(H1)
This is a maximin definition, wherein the minimal
maximal surface is selected. When radiating black holes
are young, the first term A(χ)/4GNdominates and is a
classical term corresponding to the area subtended by a
classicalsurface χ. Inintermediateages, thesurface χre-
mains classical and a quantum (semiclassical) correction
Σradisaddedcorrespondingtotheexteriorradiationout-
sidetheclassicalarea χ. Inlateages, theminimalsurface
χitself changes due to quantum corrections, though it is
still classical. The entropy now has a different classical
A(χ)/4GNterm and a new quantum (semiclassical) cor-
rection Σrad∪Σint, which contains an influence from the
interior of the black hole’s event horizon.
This narrative is very similar to the changes that occur
in the dominance of the O(ℏ0G0)classical and O(ℏ1G1)38
quantum (semiclassical) terms in Section I for the radi-
ating black hole in perturbed AdS 3spacetime. The late

as it is also zero degree (i.e. proportional to ξ0) and so
can be considered to modify the original area O(ℏ0G0)
A(χ)/4GNterm, Since it is a gravitational O(G1)term,
it is a gravitational correction to the classical term inline
with a quantum extremal surface. This association as an
interior contribution to the entropy of entanglement is
strengthened by the reminder that it can be interpreted
as joining the two stationary phase points on either side
of the event horizon, as described in Appendix G.
We now make some of these associations more con-
crete.
As we saw in Section F4, the AdS dual Lagrangian
forCliffordHamiltoniansassociatedwithstabilizerstates
±ξiis−L=H=i(¯ξµ¯ξν+¯ξρ¯ξσ). Similarly, in Section J3
we found that the associated Hamiltonian (and thus La-
grangian) for quantum magic gates is the same as for
the Cliffords, just evolved for a different period. So the
isometries remain the same.
Since these Lagrangians all have zero O(ℏ0G1)term,
this means that the quantum extremal surfaces associ-
ated with their early evolution are null surfaces. On
the other hand, their non-zero O(ℏ1G1)terms identifies
isometries that define quantum extremal surfaces for in-
termediate and late lifetimes. Since there are no more
termsintheexpansion, itfollowsthattheassociatedarea
to their quantum extremal surfaces never decreases.
For the O(G)transformation that produces perturbed
AdS 3spacetime in Eq. 187, the Lagrangian during early
evolution is similarly L= 0and during intermediate
evolution it is also similarly a superposition of L= 0
andH=−L=i(¯ξ4¯ξ6+¯ξ5¯ξ7). Therefore, it is in-
distinguishable from evolution associated with a stabi-
lizer state or quantum magic state. However, during late
evolution we showed that it was associated with evolu-
tion under a superposition of the prior Lagrangians and
aδτcontribution from H=−L=iℏ2Gξ0. This last
Lagrangian can be rewritten as the AdS dual element
H=−L=iℏ2G¯ξ4¯ξ5¯ξ6¯ξ7and therefore corresponds to
gravitational actions that are non-linear.
These quantum extremal surfaces for the O(G1)trans-
formation are sketched in Figure 13. Therein, we spec-
ulate that this last term is similar to the final quantum
extremal surface that wraps around the singularity [90]
associatedwithanevaporatingAdSblackholewithCFT-
bath coupling [21, 22]. If this holds, this explains how the
black hole entropy decreases after the Page turning point
due to two discontinuous geodesics forming a quantum
extremal surface that subtends a smaller overall area.

and Perturbed AdS
It may be worth spending a bit of time discussing the
lack of presence of any particle or field directly responsi-

ble for gravitation here, i.e. a graviton. The quaternion
generators of the full octonion algebra do define a par-
ticle, namely a qubit in SU (2), and the full seven octo-
nion generators also define a particle, namely an entan-
gled qutrit particle and anti-particle in SU (3). It is only
through the internal dualities present within this particle
and anti-particle that spacetime is present, namely be-
tween the quaternion generators and the non-quaternion
generators.
In this sense, for AdS 3, the quaternion generators
define an “emergent” spacetime through their algebraic
identityrelationswiththenon-quaterniongenerators,the
propertiesofwhicharedefinedbythequantumstatethey
define. As a result, for AdS 3the non-quaternion gener-
ators are not strictly explicitly necessary to define the
spacetime isometries as they can simply be written in
terms of the quaternion generators using these identity
relations. The non-quaternion generators are not adding
anything without O(G)transformations.
On the other hand, the perturbed AdS 3spacetime
is formed by a O(G)(i.e. gravitational) magic gate or
(equivalently) state. The associated spacetime isome-
tries explicitly require the non-quaternion generators to
express this spacetime’s isometries in terms of the en-39
tangled particle/anti-particles. Therefore, for perturbed
AdS 3the spacetime is still an emergent phenomenon, but
defined from the full octonion set of generators.
Just to drive the point home, a graviton needs to bespin2, and no such particle or field exists in this octonion
algebra theory. There is no explicit graviton present in
this theory.
