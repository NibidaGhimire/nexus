ABSTRACT  
Objectives:  We hypothesize that multistate models are beneficial in analyzing transitions 
through kidney states and understanding the underlying processes influencing the course of 
kidney health . Specifically, w e aim to  quantify  longitudinal acute kidney injury ( AKI) trajectories 
and to describe transitions through progressing  and recover y states and outcomes among 
hospitalized patients.  
Methods:  In this large , longitudinal cohort study, 138,449  adult patients admitted to a 
quaternary care hospital between January 2012 and August 2019 were staged  based on Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) serum creatinine criteria  as No AKI, Stage 1, 
Stage 2, Stage 3 , and Stage 3 with renal  replacement therapy  (RRT)  AKI for the first 14 days of 
their hospital stay . We fit and examined multistate models to es timate  probability of being in a 
certain  clinical state at a given time after entering each one of the AKI stages . We investigated 
the effects of age, sex, race, admission comorbidities , and prolonged intensive care unit  (ICU)  
stay on transition rates via Cox proportional hazards regression model s.  
Results:  Twenty  percent  of hospitalized encounters  (49,325 /246,964) had AKI; among patients 
with AKI, 66% (n = 32,739) had Stage 1 AKI, 18% (n = 8, 670) had Stage 2 AKI , and 17%  (n = 
7,916) had AKI Stage 3  with or without RRT. At seven days following Stage 1  AKI, 69% (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 68.8%-70.5%) were either  resolved to No AKI or discharged , while 
smaller proportions of recover y (26.8%, 95% CI: 26.1%-27.5%) and discharge (17 .4%, 95% CI: 
16.8%-18.0%) were observed following AKI Stage 2 . At fourteen days following Stage 1 AKI , 
patients with more frail conditions (Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 3 and had prolonged ICU stay)  
had lower proportion of transitioning to No AKI  or discharge states , while  No AKI patients  with 
these two  conditions had higher probability of either developing AKI or death.   
Discussion : Development of  AKI with various severities  occurs  during early periods of the 
patients’  hospitalization. M ultistate analyses showed that  the majority of Stage 2 and higher  
3 
severity AKI patients could not resolve within seve n days ; therefore , strategies preventing the 
persistence or progression of AKI would contribute to the patients’ life quality.  
Conclusions:   It is essential to identify patients at risk of developing AKI at any stage to guide 
treatment -related decisions.  We demonstrate  multistate model ing framework’s  utility as a 
mechanism for a better understanding  of the clinical course of AKI  with the potential to facilitate  
treatment and resource planning.

 INTRODUCTION  
Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in almost 25%  of hospitalized patients and up to 60% of 
patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).1-3 Persisten ce of  AKI or insufficient recovery of renal 
function exacerbates risk for chronic critical illness with reduced long-term survival and life  
quality .4, 5 To optimize  and tailor  clinical actions  and their timely delivery, it is imperative to 
understand clinical course of AKI  in terms of severity  and recovery  during  hospitaliz ation .  
Conventional  survival analysis methods have been utilized  to describe AKI trajectories 
and associated outcomes .4, 6, 7 These models have the capacity to deal with time -to-event type 
data and censored subjects , where a subject being censored refers to failing to experienc e the  
study’s event of interest or being dropped out of the s tudy by the end of the observation period 
or follow -up time.8, 9  Despite its significant merits, traditional survival analysis  methods , such as 
Kaplan -Meier methods , have certain  limitation s. For instance,  censoring action used in these 
models could be considered as uninformative since in real -world scenarios patients are subject 
to several competing risks. Competing risks model s could deal with aforementioned  structures ; 
however , both approaches treat all states as absorbing  and therefore lack inclusion of patients’ 
history. For analyses that involve  patient histories consist ing of experiencing  several events of 
interest , multistate models could be used to characteriz e the competing risks.  Applications of 
multistate models could be found  for various care levels10, 11 and different patient groups such 
as kidney dise ase12, diabetic13, surgical14, cancer15, COVID -1916, and geriatric17 cohorts . 
Multistate models ar e specifically beneficial in analyzing temporal changes and present 
an alternative approach with considerable potential in research studies with longitudinal nature ; 
however, multistate models require  precise and detailed records of transitions between the  
identified states. In that regard, w e performed a retrospective, longitudinal study on a large 
cohort consist ing of 242,643 adult hospitalizations , 48,915 of which were diagnosed with AKI 
based on KDIGO criteria .18 Our objectives in this study could be summarized as: 1) to  
 
 
 understand the  clinical course of AKI among hospitalized adult patients by estimating  probability 
of being in a certain clinical state  at a given time after entering each one of the AKI stages , and 
2) to investigate the effect s of age, sex, race, comorbidities , and prolonged ICU stay on 
transition rates via Cox proportional hazards regression models.  
METHODS  
Study design  
The study was designed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the 
University of Florida and the University of Florida Privacy Office (IRB 201901123). The 
University of Florida Health (UFH) Integrated Data Repository acted as  Honest Broker, a sin gle-
center, longitudinal dataset was curated from the electronic health records of 156,699 adult 
patients admitted to UFH between January 1, 2012 , and August 22, 2019. We excluded patients 
with end stage renal disease (ESRD),  encounters with no serum creat inine measurement to 
determine AKI status during hospitalization and within 48 hours of hospital admission , and 
encounters discharged within 24 hours  of admission . Our final cohort included 245,663  hospital 
encounters from 1 28,271 patients (Supplemental Figure 1, Supplemental Methods). 
Assessment of kidney function  and study outcomes  
In identifying and staging the AKI, we used  a validated computable phenotyp ing 
algorithm19 that relies on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) serum 
creatinine criteria .18, 20, 21  Reference creatinine was determined using preadmission records22 or  
estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD -EPI) Study 
equation  refit without race multiplier , as per recommendations , with a baseline estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (e GFR) assumption of  75 ml/min/per 1.73 m2 (Supplemental 
Methods) .18, 23 -25 We identified primary clinical outcomes as  No AKI, AKI Stage 1, AKI Stage 2, 
AKI Stage  3, AKI Stage 3 with RRT , hospital death , and discharge . Details regarding  
 
 
 assumptions and the phenotyping algorithm pipeline  can be found in Ozrazgat -Baslanti et al. 
(2019) .19 
Multi state analyses  
Multistate models allow intermediate events to change the risk of reaching a terminal 
state simultaneously.13 In defining and fitting a multistate model, two main component sets are 
required: state set and transition set. In this context, state set represents temporal status of a 
patient whereas transition set defines possible movements between states. States cou ld be 
categorized as absorbing (or terminal) if leaving that particular state is impossible. In other 
words, if a subject moves in to an absorbing state, the subject stays in that state forever. On the 
contrary, a state is considered transient if moving fro m that state or transitioning to another one 
is possible. Basically, state set of a multistate model is a collection of initial state(s), transient 
state(s) , and terminal state(s). Initial states could be considered as the time point of the 
subject ’s entry  into the model and returning to an initial state is not possible after the state  was 
left. Apart from absorbing and initial states, remaining transient states could be visited several 
times. The c ollection of states and transitions presents the framework for designating a 
statistical model for hazard function for each of the transition identified.  
Multistate models assist in quantifying separate transition intensities for switching from 
one particular state to another state and in quantifying the present p roportion of the patients 
occupying a specified state at a given time point. Therefore, these models allow estimating the 
probability of a clinical event occurring after an entrance to a particular state over an extended 
time. We refer the reader for relev ant background of the non -parametric or semi -parametric 
models to Andersen et al.26, Thernau et al.27, and Geskus et al . 28. 
 We developed two separate multistate models by using a large dataset that assembles 
both time -varying and static information of the patients. We identif ied eight mutually exclusive 
states based on patients’ clinical condition at each time point. These states are enumerated and  
 
 
 listed as follows: 0) Admission, 1) No AKI, 2) AKI Stage 1, 3) AKI Stage 2, 4) AKI Stage 3, 5) 
AKI Stage 3 with RRT, 6) Death, and  7) Discharge (Figure 1A). States were discretely 
determined by considering the worst AKI condition a subject experienced within 24 -hour time 
periods.  
 
Figure 1: State space diagram for clinical states used in multistate analysis (A) and daily 
transitions in the cohort (B) (Black and blue connections in left panel indicate unidirectional 
and bidirectional relations, respectively.)  
 
We first quantified the transition probabilities using an Aalen -Johansen estimation -based 
non-parametric multistat e model where the covariate effects were ignored in estimating 
transition probabilities from one state to another. Following that  estimate , in describing the 
covariate effects on the hazards, we fit a Cox model in the multistate semi -parametric 
framework. This approach aids in specifying distinct covariate effects for distinct transitions in 
the terminal states either with or without inclusion of intermediate events. We included age, sex, 
 
 
 
 race, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) , and prolonged ICU stay as the  covariate s.29 We 
presented the clinical course of the AKI patients via alluvial plots where we stratified the patients 
by considering their movements between the specified states throughout their hospitalization 
(Figure 1B).30  
We calculated instantaneous hazard rates for particular events from predetermined  
states without considering intermediate events.  Specifically,  the instantaneous hazard rates 
from No AKI, AKI Stage 1, AKI Stage 2 , and AKI Stage 3 states to these predetermined states 
including death state  were calculated . For all analyses performed, we considered time 0 as the 
entrance moment into a certain state. Patients were censored at hospital discharge , death , or at 
the end of 14 -day of observation period , whichever c ame first. Patient characteristics were 
presented  in terms of their means and standard deviations (SD), medians with interquartile 
ranges (IQR), or frequencies with percentages , as appropriate . Kruskall -Wallis test or chi -
square tests were performed to compare the data between groups , where appropriate. 
Threshold was set to 0.05 for a p -value to indicate statistical significance. All data processing 
and analyses were performed using Python 3.8 and R 4.1.2. We conducted modeling and 
statistical analyses using mstate and survival packages.31-34   
RESULTS  
Clinical characteristics of patients  
Subjects were categorized with respect to the worst AKI severity outcome during their 
hospitalization. Cohort characteristics and their statistical comparisons were reported in Table 1. 
Average age for No AKI patients was 55 and was significantly lower  than AKI groups  (Table 1). 
Female and male sex were approximately equally distributed in patient groups , except AKI 
Stage 3 with RRT group  for which a verage CCI was the highest. Hospital length of stay was 
significantly lower for No AKI cohort. Similarly, time period with mechanical ventilation and ICU 
length of stay was  lower for No AKI group .

AKI trajectory analyses  
Figure 2 demonstrates d aily transitions in the cohorts for each AKI stage. Patients 
admitted with AKI Stage 1 had the highest proportion for early resolution or discharge with the 
lowest percentage for AKI progress ion (Figure 2 A). Patients admitted with worse AKI severity  
had almost consistently lower proportions for resolution and discharge compared to AKI Stage 1 
group . Similarly, patients with more severe AKI groups  on their early day s of hospitalization had  
higher percentages for maintain ing their initial AKI stage  (Figure 2 B -D). 
Within  24 hours following the admission, 8.1% of the patients had AKI , a majority of 
which  had Stage 1 AKI (Figure 3, Table 2). From seven days after admission, 3.95% (95% CI, 
3.87%-4.02%) of the cohort had Stage 1 AKI whereas 2.12% (95% CI, 2.05 %-2.20%) 
experienced Stage 2 or more severe AKI. At that point, 35.07% (95% CI, 34.90 %-35.25%) of 
the cohort were dis charged and the probability for terminal state of death was 0.39% (95% CI, 
0.37%-0.42%). On day 7 following AKI  Stage 2 , proportion of  progress ion to higher  stages of 
AKI  (3.84% (95% CI, 3.30 %-5.85%)) was higher than  the proportion of progress ion from AKI 
Stage 1 (3.45% (95% CI, 3.20 %-3.72%)).   
 
 
  
Figure 2:  Number of patients transitioning  on consecutive  days shown for 14 days of hospitalization 
for AKI Stage 1 (A), AKI Stage 2 (B), AKI Stage 3 (C) , and AKI Stage 3 with RRT (D) patients.  The 
horizontal axis of the figures in the panels represent the days in hospital and the vertical axis 
displays the number of patients.  
 At that time point, resolved or discharged percentage of the patients with an initial status 
of AKI Stage 1 was the highest (69.68% (9 5% CI, 68.86 %-70.51%)) than cohorts  with AKI Stage 
2, 3 and 3 with RRT. Among AKI patients without RRT requirement, Stage 3 patients has the 
highest percentage for persisting condition ( 53.90% [95% CI, 52.46 %-55.37% ]). 
 
 
 
  
Figure 3: Estimated proportions of  the patients in each state on any day following admission.  
 
Patients with No AKI diagnosis had the highest transition rates to AKI Stage 1 state 
throughout the hospitalization (Figure 4 A). For those patients, first peak was observed between 
day six and day seven , whereas the second peak transfer rate to AKI Stage 1 was observed 
near end of the 14 -day hospital stay. Transfer rates to death repeated a similar pattern of peaks 
and lows with transfer hazards to AKI Stage 1 with lower rates. AKI Stag e 1 patients were more 
likely to start resolving between day two and three (Figure 4 B). Among AKI Stage 1 patients, 
top transfer rates occurred for resolving state and the second top transfer rates indicated to next 
advanced AKI stage which is Stage 2. Th ese two top processes had slightly different timings for 
jumps occurred in a 14-day time period.

Figure 4:  Instantaneous hazard rates of outcomes from clinical states in hospitalized patients 
based on multistate analysis.  
 
AKI Stage 2 cohort had the highest transition rates for regression to AKI Sage 1 and 
resolution (Figure 4 C). Among patients with AKI Stage 2, hazard rate s for transitioning to AKI 
Stage 1  were higher for the first seven days, and  followed an  irregular path thereafter with  
several declines  and a peak  near completion of two -week l ength of stay. Apart from that  
irregularity , risk for progressing to AKI Stage 3 was elevated in the period between day five and 
day ten. AKI Stage 3 patients were more likely to transfer to AKI Stage 2 compared to 
transitions to AKI Stage 1 and No AKI states (Figure 4 D).  Transition rates from AKI Stage 3 to 
AKI Stage 2, AKI Stage 1 , and No AKI were at their highest around day six. Competing risk for 
transfer to death reached top between day eight and nine.  
 
 
 
 We fit a Cox model that involves transition -specific covariates for each specified transfer 
form a given to another. In that model , the patient’s  age, sex (female vs male), race (African -
American vs non –African  American), CCI, and prolonged ICU stay were included. Age was 
dichotomized as age  < 65 and age ≥ 65 years old and CCI was dichotomized as  CCI < 3 and 
CCI ≥ 3 . Prolonged ICU was indicated with a length of stay longer than 48 hours in ICU. We 
reported the Cox regression model coefficients and p -values for these covariates in 
Supplementary Table 1. According to the results, these covariates were statistically significant in 
a majority of the identified transitions.  
Estimated percentages of patients for each state at any given day during hospital stay 
were mainly differe nt with respect to th eir accompanied admission comorbidities and need o f 
prolonged ICU stay  (Figure 5, 6, Supplemental Figures 2,  3, 4). Among AKI Stage 1 cohort, 
patients accompanied with the most severe  conditions (i.e., CCI ≥ 3 and ICU length of stay ≥ 48 
hours) had greater proportion of patients for sustained AKI Stage 1 severity and  progress ion to 
AKI Stage 2 and AKI Stage 3 and lower discharge percentage compared to  patients with milder 
conditions  (i.e., CCI < 3 and ICU length of stay < 48 hours ) (Figure 5  and 6) . Proportion of 
transfer to death condition from AKI Stage 1 were more pronounced among male patients with 
age ≥ 65 near the end of the 14 -day period of hospi tal stay. Considering the cohorts with more 
frail conditions, percentage of AKI Stage 3 progression was slightly higher for African -American 
male patients compared to non –African  American subjects. In addition, s imilar to non -
parametric analyses presented in this st udy, more advanced AKI stages were observed with 
higher tendency towards either maintaining current AKI condition or regressing to its neighbor 
AKI Stage compared to AKI Stage 1 group  (Supplementary Figures 2 -4).

 DISCUSSIO N 
We considered a large cohort of hospitalized patients and retrospectively characterized 
subjects’ AKI trajectory by using multistate models that consider the cohort’s longitudinal 
outcomes. Specifically, we  fit multistate models for a state -spac e framework that indicates the 
clinical status in addition to feasible transitions between them , and we described  the transition 
dynamics in terms of  hazard rates and transition probabilities.35 In this cohort, a ny stage AKI 
was developed among 20% of the patients , where the majority of AKI outcome was labeled as 
Stage 1.  Tabulated admission comorbidity frequencies were higher  among patients with AKI  
compared to No AKI stratum . Specifically,  CCI value greater than three  was associated with 
more advanced AKI stage , where there  were significant  and gradual  increases in its occurrence  
for patients with No AKI ( 26%), AKI  Stage 1  (46%), AKI Stage 2 (47%), AKI Stage 3 (53%) , and 
AKI Stage 3 with RRT  (62%). Additionally,  more advanced AKI trajector ies were also associated 
with longer mechanical ventilation period, ICU stay , and hospitalization.  
  In order to understand the transition process es between clinical states regarding the AKI  
status , death , and discharge , we modeled the patients’ experiences over the course of the first 
14 days of h ospitalization. Towards that aim, w e first calculated  Aalen -Johansen estimators via 
non-parametric multistate model s and estimated the instantaneous hazard rates  of each 
transition occurrence  in addition to the probability of being in certain states at a given time point. 
This granular and time -dependent analyses demonstrated AKI Stage 1 as the AKI condition with 
the lowest tendency towards developing more advanced  stages. To clari fy, after seven days 
following initiation of AKI Stage  1, 69% of this patient group had either  resolved AKI or were 
discharged. In contrast, seven days following AKI Stage 2, estimated proportion of patients 
either being discharged or with no AKI was 33.23% , and if regression to AKI Stage 1 was also 
included, the outcome with more desirable conditions increased to 64.38%.    
 
 
 We expanded the initial multistate analysis by modeling transitions’ hazard rates with Cox -type 
regression models to investigate the effect of a set of covariates that are potentially associated 
with events of interest . According to Cox -type models, the covariates indicate the severity of the 
overall condition of the subjects (i.e., CCI and prolonged ICU stay) heavily in fluenced the 
probability of being at a resolving or discharge. To clarify, near the end of a 14 -day period of 
hospitalization with a Stage 1 AKI  initiated at the beginning , patients admitted with a higher 
number of comorbidities with prolonged ICU stay had  highe r percentage  for being at AKI Stage 
1 state and transitioning to either progressed AKI stages or death states. In line with that, No 
AKI patients admitted with a higher number of comorbidities and who stayed ICU longer than 48 
hours had higher probab ility of being in either AKI stage or death . 
The motivation  for performing this study was that the clinical  course  of AKI for 
hospitalized patients had not been sufficiently described  with multistate models that exploit 
granular and longitudinal structures , despite  similar work ha ving been performed for smaller 
patient populations.  In a retrospective analysis of critically ill COVID -19 patients , a cohort of 367 
subjects  were considered and their AKI transitions were described with multistate models.36 In 
this study, Lyons et al. presented the estimated probabilities of being in a specified clinical 
status where the AKI related states  rely on the worst AKI sta ge within 12 -hour blocks.  Another 
recent multistate modeling application for investigating kidney disease progression was given 
for a cohort of 225 patients  who were  prescribed colistin.37 In addition to AKI, a retrospective 
study for modeling transitions between CKD stages via multistate methods was given for a 
cohort of 117 hospitalized and no n-hospitalized patients.38 To our knowledge, this study is the 
first large -scale, gra nular application of multistate methods for describing the characteristics 
influencing the transitions towards progressed or regressed AKI stages in addition to discharge 
and death states.  With the aid of a large, diverse cohort of hospitalized subjects , we utilized 
multistate methods in modeling the longitudinal outcomes regarding the patients’ AKI status.   
 
 
 Multistate models developed in this study output a probabilistic way to describe  clinical 
course of AKI among hospitalized patients . Those estimations  could be utilized in  planning 
prevention  decisions , resource usage , and timely intervention  of AKI. Despite our use of  a large 
and diverse cohort in building the multistate models, the cohort relies on a single  institution . 
Therefore, this single -center  design limits generalizability to other practice settings. The timing 
precision of a transition relies on the serum creatinine measure date and time , so a future work 
could be based on defining AKI conditions considering hourly basis urine output criteria , which 
also allows more  precise and timely monitoring  as well as  transition time records.  
CONCLUSIONS  
Harnessing the  granular and longitudinal information processing capability of multistate 
model s, we estimated possible pathways in clinical trajectories  of AKI among hospitalized 
patients , thus stressing  the ability of this approach to convey  insights into AKI course from a 
probabilistic perspective. Moreover,  the large and diverse cohort  was expected to assist  mitigat ing 
the bias in fitting the model. Precise and timely identification of patients at elevated risk for AKI 
progress or other terminal states may facilitate the delivery  of tailored treatments that prevent 
adverse outcomes  or foster  kidney  recovery to improve life quality and optimize resource 
planning .
