ABSTRACT
Context. The surface properties of rotating stars can vary from pole to equator, resulting in anisotropic stellar winds which are not
included in the currently available evolutionary models.
Aims. We developed a formalism to describe the mass and angular momentum loss of rotating stars which takes into account both the
varying surface properties and distortion due to rotation.
Methods. Adopting the mass-loss recipe for non-rotating stars, we assigned to each point on the surface of a rotating star an equivalent
non-rotating star, for which the surface mass ﬂux is given by the recipe. The global mass-loss and angular momentum loss rates are
then given by integrating over the deformed stellar surface as appropriate. Evolutionary models were computed and our prescription
is compared to the currently used simple mass-loss enhancement recipes for rotating stars.
Results. We ﬁnd that mass-loss rates are largely insensitive to rotation for models not a ected by the bi-stability jump. For those
aected by the bi-stability jump, the increase in mass-loss rates with respect to time is smoothed. As our prescription considers the
variation of physical conditions over the stellar surface, the region a ected by the bi-stability jump is able to grow gradually instead
of the whole star suddenly being a ected.
Conclusions. We have provided an easy to implement and ﬂexible, yet physically meaningful prescription for calculating mass
and angular momentum loss rates of rotating stars in a one-dimensional stellar evolution code which compares favourably to more
physically comprehensive models.
The implementation of our scheme in the stellar evolution code MESA is available online: https://zenodo.org/record/7437006

1. Introduction
All massive stars su er from the e ects of stellar winds. For O-
type stars, the winds can be so strong that a signiﬁcant portion
of the star evaporates and the evolutionary pathway is altered
dramatically, for example forming a Wolf-Rayet star (Maeder &
Meynet 1987; de Koter et al. 1997). In contrast, lower-mass stars
typically lose only a negligible fraction of their mass to winds.
However even a non-magnetic wind carries angular momentum
away from a star, and a star’s spin evolution can even be a ected
by weak winds (Langer 1998).
In the simplest sense, the density and velocity structure and
thus also the mass-loss rate of a radiation-driven wind is deter-
mined by the opposing e ects of gravity and radiative accel-
eration. Gravity serves to bind material to the stellar surface,
while radiation, through both continuum and line opacities, pro-
vides a force to overcome gravity (Castor et al. 1975; Pauldrach
et al. 1986). Rotation directly a ects both the gravitational ﬁeld
strength and the radiation ﬁeld (von Zeipel 1924), with both
varying over the stellar surface, in turn resulting in an anisotropic
wind (Poe & Friend 1986; Cranmer & Owocki 1995; Curé &
Rial 2004).
For an anisotropic wind, attention needs to be paid to angu-
lar momentum loss since mass lost at the equator carries a larger
speciﬁc angular momentum than mass lost near the poles, espe-
cially so for stars that are signiﬁcantly deformed from sphericity.Owing to internal structural changes, stars born with moderate
rotation may evolve to become extremely fast rotators (Hastings
et al. 2020b), so the e ects of rotation on stellar winds have the
potential to be relevant to a large portion of stars.
For a number of decades, massive star modelling e orts
(Heger et al. 2000; Brott et al. 2011; Paxton et al. 2013) have
described the e ects of rotation on mass loss by increasing the
mass-loss rate of an equivalent non-rotating star by a factor that
depends on the rotation rate (Friend & Abbott 1986). Such a
formulation is lacking due to two issues. Firstly, it is assumed
that, independent of the wind recipe used, rotation always in-
creases mass-loss rates by the same relative amount. This is not
a fair assumption because two of the major e ects of rotation
on the surface of a star are to weaken the gravitational ﬁeld
and to reduce the surface-averaged e ective temperature (von
Zeipel 1924). These two e ects generally, though not always,
serve to counteract each other, with winds being enhanced by
weaker gravities but diminished by lower e ective temperatures.
It is unclear which e ect dominates. Both the dependence of the
mass-loss rate on temperature and the assumed temperature pro-
ﬁle across the stellar surface (gravity darkening law) will govern
whether rotation enhances or reduces mass loss, meaning that the
enhancement ought to be model dependant (cf. Müller & Vink
2014).
Secondly, some of the mathematical functions used to pro-
vide the mass-loss enhancement diverge as the star approaches

the critical velocity. While this behaviour is used in stellar evo-
lution calculations merely to prevent models from exceeding
critical rotation (Heger et al. 2000; Petrovic et al. 2005), it is
unphysical not least because it is usually1only material at the
equator which achieves the critical rotation velocity, and strictly
the equator covers an inﬁnitesimally small surface, while gravity
does manage to keep the star bound over the rest of the surface.
Angular momentum loss from massive stars plays a role in
several active research topics such as the study of Be stars (Curé
2004; Curé et al. 2005; Ekström et al. 2008; Hastings et al.
2020b); the occurrence of chemically homogeneous evolution,
relevant to double black-hole mergers (Marchant et al. 2016) and
gamma-ray burst progenitors (Yoon et al. 2006; Aguilera-Dena
et al. 2020); wind-driven orbital evolution in massive binary stars
(MacLeod & Loeb 2020; Sen et al. 2021); and of course the ro-
tation rates of stars in general. Improved modelling of the winds
of rotating stars would be beneﬁcial to the advancement our un-
derstanding of stellar physics.
Various studies concerning winds from rotating massive stars
have been performed (e.g. Poe & Friend 1986; Poe et al. 1989;
Owocki et al. 1994; Cranmer & Owocki 1995; Pelupessy et al.
2000; Petrenz & Puls 2000; Curé et al. 2012; Müller & Vink
2014; Gagnier et al. 2019b), although the results of which have
not been adopted for use in stellar evolution codes. Our aim is to
provide a simple and easily implementable scheme that improves
upon the popular rotationally enhanced mass-loss schemes. We
applied our scheme to the one-dimensional stellar evolution code
MESA and provide the ﬁles necessary to compute models using
it2.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 details the
derivation of our stellar wind prescription. In Section 3 we com-
pare the results of our new wind model to the commonly used
rotationally enhanced mass-loss prescription. A brief discussion
of uncertainties is given in Section 4. Section 6 hosts a compar-
ison of our results to more sophisticated approaches. Lastly, our
conclusions are put forward in Section 7.
2. Method
2.1. Anisotropic wind model
Our basic philosophy is to apply a one-dimensional wind recipe
to every point on the surface of a rotating star. For every point
on the stellar surface, the given wind recipe uses the local phys-
ical conditions to provide a surface mass-ﬂux, which when inte-
grated results in global mass and angular momentum loss rates.
We shall now determine the surface properties of a rotating star.
2.1.1. Surface properties of a rotating star
A rotating star with mass M, polar radius Rp, equatorial radius
Re, luminosity Lis assumed to be rotating rigidly with angular
velocity 
. In reasonable agreement with detailed stellar models
(Maeder 2009), we assume that the polar radius is not a ected
by rotation. The contribution of radiative acceleration to the to-
tal gravity shall be ignored, as we focus primarily on stars with
luminosities below the Eddington luminosity. The critical veloc-
ity, or break-up velocity is then the Keplerian angular velocity,
at which the gravitational force matches the centrifugal force at

ity) and a near-Eddington luminosity, material becomes unbound over
the whole surface of the star (Maeder & Meynet 2000).

Kep: (2)
Recent two-dimensional models of rotating stars suggest that
the rotation velocity at which material becomes unbound from
the stellar surface is very close to the Keplerian velocity (Gag-
nier et al. 2019a). However, these models only cover two sep-
arate values of the stellar mass (15 and 40 M ) at one point in
their evolution. Therefore we cannot exclude that for very lumi-
nous stars, radiation might play a signiﬁcant role in unbinding
material from the surface and thus reducing the critical rotation
velocity. This issue is discussed further in Sec. 2.2.
We note that several di erent working deﬁnitions of the criti-
cal velocity velocity exist (see discussion in Section 2.3.1 of Riv-
inius et al. 2013 and their Eqns. 3 and 4 ). Our choice is made
to be consistent with the stellar evolution code MESA (Paxton
et al. 2019).
In the co-rotating frame of a rotating star, the centrifugal
force is perpendicular to the rotation axis, which causes the ef-
fective surface gravity to to become latitude-dependant. Follow-
ing from the varying surface gravity , e ective temperature also
varies across the surface (von Zeipel 1924). Also e ected is the
star’s shape, evidenced by a bulging equator. These three e ects
shall now be quantiﬁed in order.
As massive stars are centrally condensed, the use of the
Roche potential is justiﬁed (Collins 1965; Rieutord 2016). We
deﬁne the e ective surface gravity as the sum of self-gravitation
and centrifugal forces which is

cause we assume that every point on the surface can be treated as
an equivalent non-rotating star (i.e. we wish to reduce the two-
dimensional problem of a rotating star to one dimension), and
that the ﬂux vector is nearly perfectly aligned with the gravity
vector in a rotating star (Espinosa Lara & Rieutord 2011), the
magnitude of the gravity vector is the quantity of interest, not
the gravitaional ﬁeld strength in the radial direction.

The e ective temperature proﬁle is given by the model of Es-
pinosa Lara & Rieutord (2011), which assumes a Roche poten-
tial and that the ﬂux at the surface of a star is well approximated
by
# F()= f(r;)# ge; (6)
which requires the energy ﬂux to be anti-parallel to the e ective
gravity. This condition is fulﬁlled in stars with convective en-
velopes and is also valid to within a very ﬁne tolerance in stars
with radiative envelopes (Espinosa Lara & Rieutord 2011). The
function f(r;) is found by demanding that no heat is generated

Alternative gravity darkening laws are available (Slettebak 1949;

note that the gravity darkening model of Espinosa Lara & Rieu-
tord (2011) predicts that the equatorial ﬂux of a critically rotating
star is zero, which might be unphysical.

2.1.2. Mass and angular momentum ﬂux

Calculating the surface mass ﬂux of a rotating massive star re-
quires not only knowledge of the general mechanics of radiation-
driven winds but also of several rotation speciﬁc phenomena and
their interplay in driving a wind. As of yet, general mass-loss
recipes exist only for non-rotating stars, and even those di er
signiﬁcantly depending on methods and assumptions. It is felt
that although the use of a non-rotating wind recipe cannot cap-
ture the ﬁne details of physical processes in rotating stars, their
use in describing rotating star winds is still beneﬁcial and above
all represents an improvement over the almost exclusively used
rotationally enhanced mass-loss scheme.
Using the e ective surface gravity proﬁle, e ective temper-
ature proﬁle and surface shape of a rotating star, we may assign
an equivalent non-rotating star to each co-latitude of the rotating
star, for which the mass-loss rate is given by a chosen recipe.
This equivalent non-rotating star is deﬁned to have the same ra-
dius, e ective temperature and surface gravity as a given latitude
on the rotating star. The surface mass-ﬂux is then, in general
˙m()=˙M(j# ge()j;Te();r();:::)

where ˙Mis the function provided by the non-rotating wind
recipe. The only requirement for the recipe is that it is a func-
tion of, or can be manipulated to be a function of, at least the
eective surface gravity, e ective temperature and radius.
For the calculations in this work, we shall use the mass-loss
recipe of Vink et al. (2001), although in principle any recipe can
be used. Here the mass-loss rate is a function of the stellar mass,
eective temperature, luminosity and metallicity, Z. For our pur-
poses, we ﬁrst need to modify the input parameters of the recipe.
The mass and luminosity of a non-rotating star can be de-
scribed using the e ective surface gravity and e ective tempera-
ture, provided the radius is known. This means that at each lati-
tude of a rotating star, an equivalent non-rotating star would have
a dierent mass (following from the radius and surface gravity of
the rotating star) and a di erent luminosity (following from the
eective temperature and radius). To account for this, the mass-
dependence must be expressed instead in terms of the surface
gravity and radius. As luminosity is determined by the Stefan-
Boltzmann law, an e ective luminosity for each colatitude on a
rotating star can be deﬁned as
Le()=4r()2Te()4: (15)
This equivalent luminosity represents the luminosity that a non-
rotating star, with equal surface properties of a given colatitude,
would have. It is therefore this quantity that must be used in place
of the luminosity in the mass-loss recipe, which becomes

2.2. Critical rotation velocity
For a star, there exists a critical (or break-up) rotation velocity
at which material becomes unbound from the stellar surface. Al-
though a simple concept, there are several nuances which shall
be discussed here. In this work we assume that the critical ve-
locity is attained when the centrifugal and gravitational forces
balance, however in general this is likely only an approximation.
In massive stars the force from radiation itself contributes
to the force balance, and thus has been proposed to reduce the

critical velocity (Langer 1997). The acceleration produced by
radiation is proportional to the ﬂux and opacity, which are both
eected by rotation. As ﬁrst argued by Glatzel (1998), when a
luminous star rotates very quickly, gravity darkening causes the
equatorial ﬂux to weaken strongly, suggesting that the appro-
priate limit is the Keplerian one. Although analysis by Maeder
& Meynet (2000) determined that below a threshold luminosity
(around 60% of the Eddington luminosity), the radiation force
indeed plays no role in unbinding material from the surface, the
issue is still not clear cut, as discussed in the following.
Gravity darkening is traditionally described by V on Zeipel’s
Law, which states that e ective temperature is proportional to
eective gravity to the power of , with=0:25. Interferomet-
ric observations of rapidly rotating stars have demonstrated that
gravity darkening is not as strong as predicted by V on Zeipel’s
Law, with lower values for faster rotators (Monnier et al. 2007;
Zhao et al. 2009; Che et al. 2011; Domiciano de Souza et al.
2014). These observations are generally consistent with two-
dimensional numerical models (Espinosa Lara & Rieutord 2013)
and analytic gravity darkening models (Espinosa Lara & Rieu-
tord 2011), but one star, Cassiopeiae, appears to exhibit much
weaker gravity darkening than expected (Che et al. 2011), per-
haps exposing weaknesses in our understanding of gravity dark-
ening. Weaker gravity darkening would result in a stronger ra-
diative force at the equator, hence helping to reduce the critical
velocity.
The surface opacity of a rotating star is also uncertain.
Maeder & Meynet (2000) assumed that the region with the high-
est opacity would be the equator, as this is the coldest part of the
surface. However, the centrifugal force also causes a decrease
in the matter density at the equator, consequently decreasing the
opacity. Two-dimensional numerical models of stars on the zero-
age-main-sequence suggest that the e ect of decreasing density
dominates, thus a fast rotating star is predicted to have a lower
equatorial opacity than an equivalent non-rotating star (Gagnier
et al. 2019a), meaning that radiative acceleration is unable to
contribute to the force balance. However there may be some ex-
ceptions. Firstly stars may su er the e ects of opacity bumps
caused by recombination of certain species (notably hydrogen,
helium and iron; Iglesias & Rogers 1996), that could drastically
alter the opacity proﬁle over the surface of the star. Secondly in
very hot stars, where the opacity is dominated by electron scat-
tering, the surface opacity is largely independant of temperature
and thus spatially uniform. Such a case would need careful study
to determine whether the break-up velocity is a ected.
Classical Be stars are fast rotators with a decretion disc,
which are believed to be typically rotating at approximately 70%
of the Keplerian velocity (Porter 1996; Rivinius et al. 2013;
Zorec et al. 2016; Dufton et al. 2022), and in some cases even
lower (Huang et al. 2010; Zorec et al. 2016). It may be reason-
ably supposed that an outﬂowing disc will a ect the structure of
its host star, such that the surface ﬂux and opacities may be dif-
ferent when a disc is present, thus altering the break-up velocity.
There is evidence to suggest that the threshold rotation rate for
the Be phenomenon, assumed to be the true break-up velocity,
varies with e ective temperature (Cranmer 2005; Huang et al.
2010), with hotter Be stars rotating more slowly than their cool
counterparts. It is well understood that hotter stars are closer to
the Eddington limit, which may suggest that indeed in the hot-
ter Be stars, radiative acceleration does play a role in unbinding
material.2.3. Numerical method
In order to investigate the e ect of our prescription on the evo-
lution of both mass and angular momentum loss rates of rotat-
ing stars, we employ the one-dimensional detailed stellar evolu-
tion code MESA (Paxton et al. 2019), version 12115. The ﬁles
required to compute models presented in this work are avail-
able online3. The adopted physics is largely identical, except
for the stellar winds, to that of Brott et al. (2011) and imple-
mented in MESA as by Schootemeijer et al. (2019). The models
include internal angular momentum transport achieved by mag-
netic torques (Spruit 2002) which enforce near solid-body rota-
tion during most of the main-sequence evolution.
We run two sets of models, one using the rotationally en-
hanced mass-loss scheme as it is usually implemented in MESA
(named the standard scheme), where the mass-loss rates are ﬁrst
calculated using the recipe of Vink et al. (2001) and then follow-

: (17)
The second set uses mass-loss rates set by the method out-
lined in Sec. 2.1 and is named the local scheme. Both sets rely on
the wind mass-loss recipe of Vink et al. (2001). This wind recipe
includes the bi-stability jump e ect (ﬁrst found by Pauldrach &
Puls 1990), where mass-loss rates are theorised to increase dra-
matically during the transition to temperatures cooler than ap-
proximately 22kK owing to the recombination of Fe IV in the at-
mosphere (Vink et al. 1999). The impact of the bi-stability jump
on mass-loss rates is not certain, with Björklund et al. (2022)
noting that ’the drastic ˙Mincrease found in earlier models in
this region might simply be an artefact of not being dynamically
consistent around the sonic point, and not allowing properly for
the feedback between radiative and velocity acceleration’. The
quantitative behaviour of models near the jump is also contested
(Markova & Puls 2008; Vink 2018; Krti ˇcka et al. 2021). We
stress that our method is not conﬁned to a particular mass-loss
recipe and that several others could be used, for example those of
Kudritzki et al. (1989); Sundqvist et al. (2019); Björklund et al.
(2022).
For the standard scheme, stellar winds are assumed to be
isotropic with the angular momentum loss ˙L, given by
˙L=jsurf˙M; (18)
where jsurfis the speciﬁc angular momentum of the distorted
surface and ˙Mthe global mass-loss rate (Paxton et al. 2019).
The local scheme computes angular momentum loss according
to Eqns.12 and 13, taking into account both the anisotropic wind
and surface deformation caused by rotation.
We compute models with a chemical mixture representing
the Large Magellanic Cloud as in Brott et al. (2011). Two ini-
tial masses of 10 M and 20 Mare chosen to straddle the bi-
stability jump. We run models with an initial equatorial rotation
velocity of 300 km s 1until core hydrogen depletion, deﬁned as
a central hydrogen mass fraction of 1 10 4. The chosen rota-
tion velocity represents the typical value for early B-stars found
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (Dufton et al. 2013) and corre-
sponds to an initial critical rotation fraction of around 0.45 for
both masses.

Article number, page 4 of 12Hastings et al.: A model of anisotropic winds from rotating stars for evolutionary calculations
It is also useful to assess numerical models with varying
rotation rates at a ﬁxed point in their evolution. To this end
we run models with very small timesteps until the model has
burnt 3% by mass of its initial supply of hydrogen in the core
(Xc=0:7169). This is approximately the earliest point at which
the model ﬁnds itself in thermal and nuclear equilibrium and
hence is a good point in the star’s evolution to investigate. We
shall term the point when Xc=0:7169 the zero-age-main-
sequence.
Our models are numerically stable until initial critical veloc-
ity fractions, !, of around 0.65, so to investigate stars with faster
rotation, an extrapolation is performed. The local wind scheme
requires as inputs the stellar mass, rotation rate, polar radius and
luminosity .
The polar radius is assumed to be invariant to rotation, so
this is known from a non-rotating model. For the luminosity, we
extrapolate from the slower rotating models as described in Ap-
pendix B up to !=0:9. Using the four named quantities, the
eective gravity and e ective temperature proﬁles can be calcu-
lated (as outlined in Sec. 2.1.1), and resultingly the surface mass-
ﬂux. Thus we may investigate the behaviour of our scheme for
very fast rotating stars on the zero-age-main-sequence despite
not having stellar models at these rotations. Stars born with mod-
erate rotation may evolve to rotate at high critical velocity frac-
tions owing to internal structural changes (Hastings et al. 2020b),
so it is important to check the behaviour of our scheme at near
critical rotations.
3. Results
3.1. Mass loss on the zero-age-main-sequence
Figure 1 shows the surface mass ﬂux as a function of colatitude
for 10 Mand 20 Mmodels rotating at various rates. All mod-
els displayed have a central hydrogen mass fraction of 0.7169,
equating to 97% of the initial hydrogen mass fraction. It is seen
that for slow rotation, mass ﬂux is stronger at the poles and
weaker at the equator. This occurs because rotation results in a
hotter pole, relative to the non-rotating case, and a cooler equa-
tor, and stellar winds are very sensitive to e ective temperature
changes.
For faster rotating 10 M models, mass-ﬂux experiences a
jump at colatitudes between 60 and 80caused by the bi-stability
jump. Moving from pole to equator across the stellar surface,
eective gravity and hence e ective temperature decrease. At
some point, the e ective temperature subceeds the ’jump tem-
perature’ at which Fe IV recombines to Fe III causing a sud-
den, dramatic increase in the mass ﬂux, as evidenced in the left
panel of Fig. 1. The 20 M model does not undergo the same
phenomenon as here the e ective temperature always exceeds
the jump temperature.
The global mass-loss rate depends on both the surface mass-
ﬂux and the stellar surface area. For the wind recipe of Vink
et al. (2001) used in this work, provided the ionisation equi-
librium does not change signiﬁcantly, faster rotation is seen to
cause a decreasing surface mass-ﬂux at the equator. Also rota-
tion increases the surface area of the equatorial region due to
the equatorial bulge. These two e ects can o set one another,
causing the global mass-loss rate to be roughly independent of
rotation, as exempliﬁed by models shown in Fig. 2. We note that
because of the relatively small area covered by the polar region,
the polar surface mass-ﬂux does not contribute signiﬁcantly to
the global mass-loss rate.For the 10 M model in the local scheme, mass loss de-
creases slightly with faster rotation, until the bi-stability jump
comes into e ect at!0:5 and drives mass-loss rate up. In con-
trast, the 20 M model displays almost no change in mass-loss
rates until!0:3 and then a small increase thereafter, due to the
eect of the growing surface area of the equator dominating over
the diminished equatorial surface mass-ﬂux. We note that, except
for models a ected by the bi-stability jump, our local scheme
produces slightly weaker winds than the standard scheme. Our
models show that excluding the e ects of the bistability jump,
mass-loss rates of a rotating star are not predicted to be signiﬁ-
cantly di erent to that of an equivalent non-rotating star.
At very high initial rotation rates, our estimates of the mass-
loss rate from extrapolation of the luminosity show that for the
20 Mmodel, the increase in mass-loss rate is modest, 10% at
most. Whereas the cooler 10 M model displays mass-loss rate
enhancement of a factor 9 at !=0.9. We are thus conﬁdent that
our scheme behaves reasonably at near-critical velocities.
3.2. Evolutionary models
Our evolutionary models are presented in Fig. 3 where panels
a) and b) show the evolution of global mass-loss rates. In the
standard scheme the bi-stability jump is implemented as a sharp
jump, however in the local scheme the jump is more gradual,
owing to the fact that as the star cools, the region of the surface
aected by the jump grows, causing the mass-loss to also grad-
ually increase.
Panels c) and d) of Fig. 3 show the normalised speciﬁc an-
gular momentum loss of our evolutionary models, given as
˙L
2
3˙M
R2eq: (19)
This is a unitless quantity that describes the strength of angular
momentum loss independently of the rotation rate and mass-loss
rate. A spherical star with an isotropic wind (i.e. a slowly rotat-
ing star) has a normalised speciﬁc angular momentum loss of 1.
Values larger than unity imply that the star is losing more an-
gular momentum per unit mass than the spherically symmetric
case and that spin-down will occur more rapidly. This quantity
is sensitive to both the anisotropy of the wind and the deforma-
tion of the star. We see that away from the bi-stability jump tem-
peratures, models using the local scheme su er lower angular
momentum losses than the standard scheme. This reduced nor-
malised speciﬁc angular momentum loss means that stars may be
able to maintain faster rotation rates. The opposite is true when
mass-ﬂux across the stellar surface is increased due to the bi-
stability jump, because the model loses large quantities of mass
from the equatorial regions.
Panels e) and f) of Fig. 3 show the equatorial velocities of
our models. Comparing the velocities near the end of the main-
sequence, we see that the local scheme displays larger rotational
velocities, due to the generally lower mass-loss and normalised
speciﬁc angular momentum losses as shown in the upper two
panels. The e ect is greatest in the 20 M model, with velocities
increased by roughly 10% compared to the standard scheme.
4. Uncertainties
When attempting to describe a two-dimensional phenomenon
with a one-dimensional model there are inevitably shortcomings.
Most stellar evolution codes compute the structure of a rotat-
ing star by applying certain corrections to the stellar structure

equations that are designed to produce the average properties
along an isobar (for a detailed description see Heger et al. 2000).
This approximation may break down under certain conditions,
for example when the surface temperature at the equator is cool
enough for helium-I to form yet the pole it is not, the opacity
will vary greatly over the stellar surface causing di erent phys-
ical conditions at the equator and pole. In such a case, averagequantities will not capture this diversity and may lead to di erent
structures as computed by one and two-dimensional models.
A weakness of our wind scheme is that to determine the
local mass-ﬂux, we use a mass-loss recipe that was calculated
for non-rotating stars. Such a recipe naturally ignores rotational
phenomena like non-spherical geometry and the e ects of limb-
darkening. What is more, the ionisation of the wind is expected
to be sensitive to radiation from various latitudes on the stellar
Article number, page 7 of 12A&A proofs: manuscript no. le1
surface (Petrenz & Puls 2000), which could e ect the mass-loss
rates.
A fundamental assumption of our scheme is that the wind
is launched from the stellar surface and moves parallel to the
photon ﬂux (which is assumed to correspond to the direction of
the eective gravity). In reality, a wind is continually accelerated
until it reaches the terminal wind velocity and during this accel-
eration a wind particle may be inﬂuenced by photons streaming
at an oblique angle to the stellar surface. This would introduce
a non-radial line force (particularly in combination with a polar-
angle dependent velocity ﬁeld), which may alter the wind struc-
ture and angular momentum content (Owocki et al. 1996; Gay-
ley & Owocki 2000). What is more, in our model the e ective
gravity, and hence ﬂux, have a nonradial direction, while most
one-dimensional mass-loss recipes assume a purely radial ﬂux.
When running models at large critical velocity fractions, cau-
tion must be exercised, as one may be extrapolating from the
non-rotating wind recipe. For any given wind recipe, there are
bounds in which the input parameters are valid and it is entirely
possible that under extreme rotation the local surface conditions
fall outside of the prescribed bounds. Should this occur, a second
suitable wind recipe could be used to give the local mass ﬂux for
the eected regions, for example a cool star wind recipe may be
appropriate for describing the equatorial wind.
5. Applicability of the local mass-loss scheme
The pre-requisites for the mass-loss scheme presented here are
that the star’s shape needs to be well described by the Roche po-
tential and the gravity darkening law of Espinosa Lara & Rieu-
tord (2011) must be valid. This is in general true for both con-
vective and radiative stars that do not have near-Eddington lumi-
nosities and are rotating sub-critically (Espinosa Lara & Rieu-
tord 2011), however there are further cases where these condi-
tions are not met and other special cases which will be discussed
here.
For very luminous stars, the radiative acceleration may facil-
itate the unbinding of material from the stellar surface at lower
rotation velocities than the Keplerian velocity. As this e ect is
ignored in our formalism, our scheme is not appropriate for very
luminous objects. In light of the ﬁndings of Maeder & Meynet
(2000), we would conservatively advise the limit of applicability
to be 60% of the Eddington luminosity. Improved gravity dark-
ening laws and a more detailed account of the stellar surface
opacity could possibly allow for applying our scheme also at
higher Eddington factors, but this still needs to be investigated
(see Sec. 2.2).
Furthermore, luminous stars may su er the e ects of inﬂa-
tion whereby radiation pressure "inﬂates" the star, producing a
very tenuous, extended envelope (Ishii et al. 1999; Sanyal et al.
2015). If the radiation pressure deviates from spherical sym-
metry, then the strength of inﬂation will vary according to lat-
itude, suggesting that the star’s shape is not well described by
the Roche potential. Our mass-loss scheme is therefore not ap-
plicable to inﬂated stellar models. Inﬂation is expected to occur
at masses above 30 M for stars with galactic metallicity, but for
much higher masses at lower metallicities (Sanyal et al. 2017).
A star may su er the e ects of additional forces which can
alter the surface e ective gravity beyond the Roche potential.
Examples include radial pulsations, accelerations from rapid ex-
pansion or contraction and a close binary companion. Such cases
would need to be dealt with separately, although our scheme
could be extended to them.While our scheme may be applied to rapid rotators, once a
star reaches critical velocity, evolutionary models demand that
the star lose enough angular momentum to maintain sub-critical
rotation. It is not entirely clear how this may happen, there are
several possibilities. The star may undergo a "mechanical mass-
loss episode", losing the required angular momentum through
increased mass loss at the equator only (Granada et al. 2013).
The other extreme is to lose angular momentum via an isotropic
wind, as is currently done in MESA models, but one may also
prescribe for mass to be lost from the surface in any conﬁgura-
tion. For at least some fast rotating stars in nature, a circumstel-
lar decretion disc forms that can e ciently drain angular mo-
mentum from the star (Krti ˇcka et al. 2011). For lower-mass stars
(M/10M), the required angular momentum loss rates, and cor-
respondingly required mass loss rates are low (Granada et al.
2013), hence the evolution of the star is largely insensitive to
the mechanics of angular momentum loss at the critical velocity.
This is not true for more massive stars, which can lose upwards
of 10% of their initial mass from rotating critically (cf. Table 1
of Granada et al. 2013), so how exactly angular momentum is
drained from a critical rotator becomes important. Therefore we
advise caution when stellar models achieve critical rotation.
A crucial aspect of our formulation is that it demands that
the wind is sensitive only to the local conditions of where on
the surface it was launched from. An example where this con-
dition is violated is the dust-driven winds of asymptotic giant
branch stars. Global pulsations may lead to dust formation in the
outer atmosphere, which is essential for the wind driving (Win-
ters et al. 2000).
6. Comparison to other studies
Several authors have investigated the problem of stellar winds
and rotation by directly taking into account rotation speciﬁc
physics. The prescription presented here is better described as
an adaptation of a wind model for non-rotating stars, so it is use-
ful to compare our results to previous studies.
It has been reported that radiation-driven winds are most
strongly a ected by gravity darkening directly beneath the point
from which the wind was launched (Cranmer & Owocki 1995).
This suggests that the wind is only sensitive to the point form
which it is launched, justifying our use of a non-rotating wind
model as our basis. It is also encouraging as limb-darkening,
which is not accounted for in our prescription, is deemed unim-
portant (Cranmer & Owocki 1995).
Petrenz & Puls (2000) calculated wind models using the con-
cept of a mean irradiating atmosphere and found the winds to
have a prolate structure, with increased mass-ﬂux at the pole.
Furthermore, for B-type stars, rotation is predicted to diminish
mass-loss rates, with models rotating at around 80% of critical
velocity displaying mass-loss rates a few percent lower than cor-
responding non-rotating models (c.f Table 4 of Petrenz & Puls
2000). Similarly, we predict a very weak rotation dependence on
mass-loss rates (away from the bi-stability jump), although our
models can show enhanced or reduced winds depending on the
stellar parameters. Müller & Vink (2014) also ﬁnd that mass-loss
actually diminishes due to the e ects of rotation, in contrast to
the rotationally enhanced wind schemes.
Pelupessy et al. (2000) focused on B[e] stars using models
including the bi-stability jump e ect. They report that rotation,
in general, enhances mass-ﬂux from the poles but hardly changes
that of the equator. The spatial variation in mass-ﬂux predicted
by Pelupessy et al. (2000) shows a discontinuity owing to the
bi-stability jump, albeit not as steep as in our results (c.f. Fig. 9
Article number, page 8 of 12Hastings et al.: A model of anisotropic winds from rotating stars for evolutionary calculations
with our Fig. 1). Pelupessy et al. (2000) predict the winds of a
20 Mstar to grow stronger with rotation, with rotation at 60%
of critical velocity boosting mass-loss by 16% compared to the
non-rotating case (c.f. Table 3).
The works mentioned above computed only stationary mod-
els, however di erent stellar parameters were used in each case.
For example the 20 M model of Petrenz & Puls (2000) had a
radius of 20 R , while that of Pelupessy et al. (2000) was more
than twice as large, 47 R . The fact that the resulting relation-
ships between rotation and mass-loss rates disagree is therefore
not surprising.
The work of Gagnier et al. (2019a) di ers from this study
twofold. Firstly, the two-dimensional ESTER code (Espinosa
Lara & Rieutord 2013) was used to compute the stellar struc-
ture, whereas here we rely on a one-dimensional code. Sec-
ondly, the local mass-ﬂux was calculated by calibrating the one-
dimensional CAK theory (Castor et al. 1975) to the wind recipe
of Vink et al. (2001). Given that models presented here and in
Gagnier et al. (2019a) are based on the same wind recipe of Vink
et al. (2001), a comparison between the two will highlight di er-
ences in the underlying methods.
To compare our scheme to that of Gagnier et al. (2019a),
a 15 Mmodel has been computed with solar metallicity as in
Brott et al. (2011) and initial critical angular velocity fraction,
!=0:5. Fig 4 compares the results of the two methods. Firstly,
we see that the equatorial e ective temperatures predicted by
both models agree to within around 2000K, and to within several
hundred Kelvin during the early evolution. This discrepancy can
largely be credited to the di erences of the structures predicted
by two and one-dimensional models and the implementation of
rotational mixing.
A disadvantage of the method of Gagnier et al. (2019a) is
that the required calibration of the surface mass-ﬂux is sensi-
tive to the strength of surface gravity, meaning that properly, (as
stars evolve to lower surface gravities) a new calibration must be
made at every timestep (see Sec. 4.2 of Gagnier et al. 2019b).
However, as the calibration is onerous, it was only carried out
for models on the zero-age-main-sequence, meaning that "the lo-
cal mass-ﬂux may be underestimated by a factor 1.7 at most".
Our scheme does not su er from this issue, which may explain
partly why our model predicts slightly higher mass-loss rates in
panel a of Fig. 4. Both models however show the same general
trend, with a gradual increase in mass-loss rates once the equa-
torial e ective temperature cools below 22-23kK. The relative
increase in mass-loss rates brought about by the bistability jump
is approximately the same in both models. The jump temperature
diers slightly in the two models because the jump temperature
is sensitive to the stellar luminosity (see Eq. 16 of Gagnier et al.
2019a). Both models naturally have di erent luminosities owing
to their di erent structures, as mentioned earlier. We ﬁnd it en-
couraging that our relatively simple scheme behaves similarly to
a two-dimensional, more advanced model.
7. Conclusions
We have presented a new and simple to implement prescrip-
tion for the mass and angular momentum loss rates of rotating
massive stars. This represents an improvement over the widely
used rotationally enhanced mass-loss schemes as we calculate
the two-dimensional mass-ﬂux over the stellar surface and are
able to compute the angular momentum loss resulting from an
anisotropic wind originating from a distorted star. Our method
involves using a mass-loss recipe for non-rotating stars to de-
termine the local mass-ﬂux across the surface of a rotating star,which is then integrated to give global mass and angular momen-
tum loss rates.
In general we notice that, away from the bi-stability jump
temperature, mass-loss rates are slightly diminished compared
to the rotationally enhanced mass-loss scheme. The local mass-
ﬂux scheme has the e ect of smoothing out the bi-stability jump
as the increase in mass-loss rate is implemented locally on the
star’s surface, not globally, also observed in the models of Gag-
nier et al. (2019a). Our models show that the presence of the
bistability-jump causes a strong relationship between rotation
and mass-loss. If the bistability-jump does not infact operate in
nature, as suggested by theoretical wind models of Björklund
et al. (2022), moderate and even fast rotation is not predicted to
strongly alter mass-loss compared to the non-rotating case. We
see evidence that the detailed relationship between rotation and
wind strength is complex, with mass-loss rates being either de-
creased or increased depending on the surface properties of the
star.
Our aim to provide a scheme for one-dimensional stellar evo-
lution codes will of course mean that simpliﬁcations must be
made. In spite of our scheme’s shortcomings, comparisons with
similar, more physically comprehensive works deliver a broad
agreement in global mass-loss rates.
Our methods are relevant to several areas of stellar astro-
physics where the evolution of angular momentum plays a deci-
sive role. For example, Be stars are known to be fast rotators, so
are expected to have strongly anisotropic winds and large distor-
tions. Models such as those presented here may therefore be used
to investigate evolutionary properties of Be stars. Secondly, the
evolution of models along a chemically homogeneous pathway
can be interrupted by spin-down caused by stellar winds (Yoon
et al. 2006). The calculations presented here suggest that angu-
lar momentum loss has been generally overestimated in stellar
models, suggesting that chemically homogeneous evolution (e.g.
Hastings et al. 2020a) may be more common or easier to main-
tain than previously thought. In the future, our wind prescription
may be implemented in the next grids of stellar evolution mod-
els in order to gain further insights into the physics of rotating
massive stars.

Appendix A: Shapes of rotating stars
Here we derive the shape of the surface of a rotating star. We assume that the star is well described as a point mass enclosed by a
massless envelope and that the polar radius in una ected by rotation. The surface of the star is then an equipotential given by the
Roche potential and reads
GM
r()+1
2
2r()2sin2()=constant; (A.1)
with Mrepresenting the stellar mass, 
the angular velocity (which is assumed to be constant across both the surface and through
the interior of the star), r() the radial co-ordinate and the co-latitude. We parameterise the strength of rotation with the Keplerian
angular velocity, deﬁned using the equatorial radius Reas

Appendix B: Surface properties of fast rotators close to the zero-age-main-sequence
Our numerical models are unable to compute the structure of a rotating star with initial rotation exceeding around 70% of the
critical velocity. However the wind properties of very fast rotating stars on the zero-age-main-sequence may be determined via
extrapolation. The wind scheme presented in this paper requires knowledge of the e ective gravity and e ective temperature proﬁle
of a star. To calculate these proﬁles, only the polar radius, luminosity, mass and rotation rate are required.
To calculate the luminosity of fast rotators on the zero-age-main-sequence, we extrapolate linearly from our models with initial
critical fractions between 0.4 and 0.6. We extrapolate the luminosity normalised to the value of the non-rotating model against the
intial fraction of critical velocity, where all values are deﬁned at the point when the central hydrogen mass fraction decreases by
3% from its initial value (this we term the zero-age-main-sequence, as it is the earliest point in which the models ﬁnd themselves
in equilibrium). This extrapolation is shown in Fig. B.1 for 10 and 20 M models. We ﬁnd that rotation rate and luminosity are
inversely proportional. This e ect is rather weak, with luminosity decreasing by approximately 6% at 60% of critical rotation. The
extrapolations suggest that at up to 90% of the critical velocity, the luminosity is reduced by no more than 10% compared to the
non-rotating case.
In line with the assumptions of the Roche potential, the polar radius is not a ected by rotation, so this value may be assumed
from a non-rotating MESA model, depicted graphically by the horizontal dashed yellow line in Fig. B.1. Indeed, as evidenced by
Fig. B.1 the numerical models predict that to within a few percent, the polar radius remains unchanged by rotation.
The results of our extrapolations compare favourably to the computed stellar structures of Ekström et al. (2008). One-
dimensional models of a 20 M star predict that the luminosity decreases by around 8% over the course of being spun up from
stationary to critical rotation (Ekström et al. 2008, Fig. 5). While the polar radius is judged to shrink very slightly with increasing
rotation, but this is at most a 2% e ect (Ekström et al. 2008, Fig. 2), thus justifying the assumption of the Roche potential.
