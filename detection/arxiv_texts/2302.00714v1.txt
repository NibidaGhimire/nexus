Abstract
Based on a microscopic model, we use a functional integral ap-
proach to evaluate the quantum interaction energy between two neu-
tral atoms. Each atom is coupled to the electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld
via a dipole term, generated by an electron bound to the nucleus via
a harmonic potential. We show that the resulting expression for the
energy becomes the Van der Waals interaction energy at the ﬁrst non-
trivial order in an expansion in powers of the ﬁne structure constant,
encompassing both the long and short distance behaviours. We also
explore the opposite, strong-coupling limit, which yields a result for
the interaction energy as well as a threshold for the existence of a
vacuum decay probability, manifested here as an imaginary part for
the eﬀective action.
In the weak-coupling limit, we also study the eﬀect of using a
general central potential for the internal structure of the atoms.
1 Introduction
A celebrated manifestation of the existence of vacuum ﬂuctuations are the
Casimir, Van der Waals, and related interactions [1, 2, 3]. The second is a
well-known example of an attractive force, between two neutral atoms, which
results from the correlation between their dipole-moment ﬂuctuations. That
correlation, on the other hand, is mediated by the (vacuum) electromagnetic
(EM) ﬁeld.
1arXiv:2302.00714v1  [quant-ph]  1 Feb 2023In this paper, we use a microscopic model to derive the interaction energy
between two neutral atoms, each one described by a static nucleus, to which
an electron is bound by a harmonic potential. The coupling of each atom to
the EM ﬁeld is, on the other hand, implemented by a dipole term. In the
approach that we follow, we evaluate the interaction energy by calculating
the Euclidean (imaginary time) eﬀective action resulting from the integration
of the quantum ﬂuctuations of the electrons and the EM ﬁeld. The vacuum
energy obtained thusly, may be thought of as the result of taking the zero-
temperature limit of the thermal free energy.
This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we introduce the model
we use to describe the system, and the tools used to evaluate the interaction
energy, in particular, its imaginary-time eﬀective action. Then, in Sect. 3,
we evaluate the static interaction energy between the two atoms, discussing
diﬀerent limits. We also derive an expression for the imaginary part of the
energy, and interpret it in terms of a vacuum decay probability. We conclude
the section by studying the case of a general central potential for the atoms,
in the weak-coupling regime.
Finally, in Sect. 4, we present our conclusions.
2 The system and its eﬀective action
2.1 The model
The model that we consider in this work deals with two atoms, labeled by 1
and2, having their centres of mass at r(1)andr(2), while the electrons are
located at the positions x(1)andx(2), relative to r(1)andr(2), respectively.
The actionS, a functional of the gauge ﬁeld Aalso, is given by:
S(x(1),x(2), A;r(1),r(2)) =Sa
0(x(1)) +Sa
0(x(2)) +Sa
I(x(1), A;r(1))
+Sa
I(x(2), A;r(2)) +SEM
0(A), (1)
whereSa
0(x)is the action for an electron in the presence of the bounding
potential,SEM
0(A)the one for the free EM ﬁeld, and Sa
Icontains the coupling
of an electron to the EM ﬁeld. The r(1)andr(2)vectors, which appear in the
action, are to be regarded as external parameters: the ones upon which the
eﬀective action will depend.
For the sake of simplicity, the action for each orbiting electron, having
massmand position x(t)relative to the nucleus, is taken to be of the form:
Sa
0(x) =m
2/integraldisplay
dt/parenleftBig
˙x2−Ω2x2/parenrightBig
, (2)
2since it will allow for the exact evaluation of the interaction energy. Note,
however, that it may be applied to some real physical systems, like heavy
muonic atoms [4, 5].
The interaction with the EM ﬁeld is assumed to be given by the dipolar
term:

Indices from the middle of the Latin alphabet: i, j, k,... run from 1to3,
while Greek ones are assumed to run from 0to3. Besides, we shall later on
useα,β,..., taking values 1and2, corresponding to the two atoms.
We follow Einstein’s convention: throughout this paper, a sum over re-
peated indices is assumed unless explicitly stated otherwise.

consisting of the standard (vacuum) Maxwell term, plus a covariant gauge-
ﬁxing term ( λ/negationslash= 0). We use natural units ( c= 1,~= 1) and the metric
signature (+,−,−,−).
2.2 Eﬀective action
A rather convenient way to obtain the quantum interaction energy for a
system composed of two or more objects is by means of its imaginary-time
eﬀective action, Γeﬀ. Indeed, by considering a static conﬁguration, one can
extract the vacuum energy by taking the limit:
EI= lim

, (5)
whereTdenotes the extent of the (imaginary) time interval [6]. Γeﬀresults
from the integration of the quantum ﬂuctuations, yielding as a result a func-
tion of the remaining, classical degrees of freedom. Since we are interested
in the interaction part of the energy, we shall subtract the self-energy contri-
butions, which are the ones that survive when the objects are inﬁnitely far
apart.

gauge ﬁeld propagator one sees that, due to the coupling to the EM ﬁeld, Ω
in the harmonic term of each atom’s action gets renormalized. Keeping the
same notation, Ω, now for the renormalized frequency, we see that

only through their distance: r≡|r|.
Finally, we integrate out the electrons’ coordinates relative to each atom.
This is still a Gaussian functional integral which, by converting to Fourier
space also the integration measure, becomes an inﬁnite product of decoupled
ordinary integrals. This means that the integral

63.1 Weak coupling and Van der Waals interaction
This corresponds to situations where, keeping a few terms in the power se-
ries expansion: log(1−x) =−/summationtext
n=1xn
n+1for each one of the logs above, is a
reliable approximation.
Moreover, we also assume here that that is achieved by means of the
two (independent) conditions:q2
2π/lessmuchm/Ω, andr/greatermuch1/Ω. The ﬁrst one is
essentially a constraint on the maximum value of the coupling constant or,
equivalently, on the size of the electric dipole ﬂuctuations on each atom.
Under those two assumptions, the leading term in the expansion is:

The integral from (25) can be computed exactly, for that we introduce the
two auxiliary functions:
f(x)≡Ci(x) sin(x)−si(x) cos(x), (26)
g(x)≡−(Ci(x) cos(x) +si(x) sin(x)), (27)
where si (x)≡Si(x)−π

The next-to-leading term at long distances corresponds to the London
limit [11, 1]. This can be picked up by extracting the next negative power
of the distance or, equivalently, by evaluating the frequency integral in (22)

The ratio between this term and the asymptotic one at long distances is
O(Ωr), as it should be.
3.2 Strong coupling: short distances and imaginary
part of the energy
One should expect the interaction energy to be real. Note, however, that
due to the presence of the logarithms, the interaction will have both real and
imaginary parts. The existence of imaginary parts for the logarithms may
be seen to depend on the value of the dimensionless ratio:
g≡q2
2π1
mΩ2r3. (32)
8The existence of an instability at short distances, and therefore of an
imaginary part in the eﬀective action, may be understood by an argument
based on the form of the intermediate eﬀective action Seﬀ, and its short
distance behaviour: the London limit. We recall that it is a quadratic form
in the electrons’ coordinates, with a frequency-dependent kernel K(ab)
ij(ν). At
suﬃciently small distances r, we may use the instantaneous approximation
for the gauge ﬁeld propagator, namely, assume that r/lessmuchλ, and therefore use
rν/similarequal0(see [1] & references there in).
This is in fact equivalent to replacing the gauge-ﬁeld propagator by its
Coulomb form. Therefore,

In this limit, transforming back the electrons ﬂuctuations from frequency to
time,Seﬀbecomes local in time, and may thus be interpreted as an action.
That action involves the original six harmonic modes (one for each x(α)
i)
with identical oscillation frequency Ω, plus anr-dependent term which cou-
ples them. Altogether, they produce a potential which we denote by Veﬀ, and
is still quadratic:

behaviour observed in the plot of the imaginary part of the energy as a
function of r. Indeed, besides the clear existence of the ﬁrst threshold at
r=r1, we also see the emergence of the second one at r=r2. Note also that
the existence of two modes for the latter is reﬂected in the steepest rise for
r<r 2. The real and imaginary parts of the interaction energy are shown in
Fig. 2.
The physical interpretation of the imaginary part of the energy is that
of a non-vanishing probability of vacuum decay, understanding as vacuum
the one used in the calculation of the eﬀective action. Regarding the atoms,
that vacuum is the tensor product of the two respective ground states. On
the other hand, when the two atoms are suﬃciently close to each other, it
is clear the true vacuum should be closer to the one of two electrons in a
molecule. That is not a tensor product of the two: rather, it should be closer
to a linear combination of two atomic orbitals. That is indeed what may be
seen from the form of the normal coordinates obtained in (36): the modes
that destabilize the vacuum correspond to x(+)=x(1)+x(2)√

3.3 General central potential
Let us consider here the case of a more general central potential V, in such a
way that the action for each atom, rather than having the speciﬁc form (2)
is now assumed to fall under the more general form:

In the special case of the three-dimensional harmonic potential we just con-
sidered before, we have,/tildewideG(0) =1

Finally, note that we can also ﬁnd the result for the London limit in the
case of a general central potential, since in that approximation we get:

which again produces the right result for the harmonic potential case.
4 Conclusions
We have presented a derivation of some known expressions for the Van der
Waals interaction energy between two atoms, based on a microscopic descrip-
tion of the system, and applying functional methods: the energy is obtained
by functional integration of the degrees of freedom in the Euclidean formal-
ism, in order to obtain the vacuum energy from the resulting eﬀective action.
We have analyzed the region where the description begins to fail, namely,
when the atoms are too close, and the dipole interaction may overcome the
binding energy of the electrons to their respective nuclei. This phenomenon
shows up as the emergence of an imaginary part in the energy, and the
consequent vacuum decay probability per unit time.
We suggest that beyond such a limit a molecular description should be
the proper framework to describe the physics of the system.
Our results may be interpreted as providing a lower bound for the dis-
tances to which one can apply the usual Van der Waals description, in terms
of parameters related to the structure of the atoms (in our case, mandΩ),
and the electromagnetic coupling ( q). For distances larger that what we de-
noted byr1, an eﬀective description for the interaction energy like the one
we have used should be reliable.
