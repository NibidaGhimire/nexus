ABSTRACT
The drift periods /u1D4432and/u1D4433were searched for using the summed power spectra of 41 pulsar s observed at declinations from −9◦
to+42◦. The power spectra of pulses with a given period, pulse width and drift behavior have been simulated, the applicability
of such a method for estimating drift parameters is shown. Fo r most pulsars, the distribution of harmonic amplitudes in t he
power spectra corresponds to the expected distribution for these pulsars without drift. At the same time, it was found th at for a
number of sources, the summed power spectra accumulated ove r a long period of time give the same drift parameters as those
determined by other methods. For 11 pulsars we have deﬁned or redeﬁned the drift period /u1D4432. For 8 sources the drift period /u1D4433
has been determined or redeﬁned. The drift direction of subp ulses was redeﬁned for them.

1 INTRODUCTION
Individual pulsar pulses consist of one or more subpulses ap pearing
at certain longitudes in the average proﬁle window. Practic ally since
the discovery of pulsars, for some of them, a change in the pos ition
of the subpulses was detected over time inside the window of t he
average proﬁle, that is, the drift of subpulses ( Drake & Craft ,1968).
The drift manifests itself in a regular shift of the subpulse phase
when observing a sequence of pulses. The subpulses form “dri ft
bands”, the horizontal separation between them correspond s to the
period/u1D4432. This period has a range from several to hundreds of
milliseconds. The position of the subpulse in the window of t he
average proﬁle is repeated after a period of time that is expr essed in
pulsar periods /u1D4431. This interval, which is generally not an integer
number, is called a period /u1D4433. Obviously, to get estimates of periods
/u1D4432and/u1D4433it is necessary to register individual pulses over a long
time interval, which is a problem, since the observed intens ity of
individual subpulses is usually low. Subpulse drifting is o bserved in
more than a third of known pulsars ( Weltevrede et al. (2006) here
and further on W06, (Song et al. (2023)). The largest number of /u1D4432
and/u1D4433estimations based on observations of individual pulses wer e
done in the paper W06. Of the 187 pulsars observed in Westerbork
at the frequency of 1,400 MHz, 170 pulsars have diﬀerent kind s of
subpulse modulation, and 68 pulsars, that is, about one thir d of them,
show drift behavior. In the paper W06 according to the drift behavior,
pulsars are divided into 3 classes: Coh, Dif and Dif* dependi ng on
the width of the spectral details in 2DFS spectra. If the deta il in
the spectrum is narrow (less than 0.05 of cycle for a period), then
the drift is coherent (Coh). Pulsars showing wide diﬀuse det ails are
divided into Dif* (the details are close to the beginning or t he end
★E-mail: serg@prao.ru (SAT)of the spectrum) and Dif (diﬀuse detail are far from the edges of the
spectrum).
Presumably, the drift behavior of pulsar subpulses is an int ernal
feature of their radiation mechanism, therefore, its study is an im-
portant physical problem. The estimation of /u1D4432and/u1D4433periods can
be inﬂuenced by diﬀerent factors. One of them is nulling, tha t is, the
skipping of successive pulses. In case of nulling, the radia tion mecha-
nism is “switched oﬀ”, and the drift velocity can become less and then
return to the previous value in some cases ( Janssen & van Leeuwen ,
2004). Another eﬀect observed for a number of pulsars is switch-
ing a mode (shape) of the integral proﬁle. When switching mod es,
the drift velocity may change ( Huguenin et al. ,1970;Izvekova et al. ,
1982). Up to now, several models are known to explain the drift be-
havior of pulsars. The most widely used one is sparking gap mo del
(Ruderman & Sutherland ,1975), developed in the works of many
authors ( Gil et al. ,2003;Qiao et al. ,2004). According to this model,
the drift behavior can be explained by the presence of rotati ng dis-
charges which circulate around the magnetic axis under the a ction of
E×Bdrift. In such a model, the arrival times of the pulses should
shift in the window of the average proﬁle, and pulsars should show
certain periods of circulation. In a number of works, the per iodicity
in the modulation of the amplitude of subpulses has been inte rpreted
as caused by the regular rotation of plasma “sub-beams” arou nd the
magnetic axis (carousel model), and the time of such circula tion
was determined ( Deshpande & Rankin ,2001;Gupta et al. ,2004) for
several pulsars.
As a rule, to measure drift periods /u1D4432and/u1D4433the spectra from the
amplitude time variations of the subpulses at diﬀerent long itudes of
the average proﬁle are used. Obviously, getting estimates o f/u1D4432and
/u1D4433is technically challenging task, since this requires obser vations of
individual pulses with a good signal-to-noise ratio ( /u1D446//u1D441) and, there-
fore, a high ﬂuctuation sensitivity of the radio telescope i s needed.

Analysis of integral two-dimensional (by time and longitud e) ﬂuc-
tuation spectra (2DFS) allowed to study the drift behavior o f a large
number of pulsars ( Edwards & Stappers ,2002;Edwards & Stappers ,
2003), (W06).
In the paper ( Malofeev & Tyul’bashev (2018) (here and further
onM18) another method of /u1D4432and/u1D4433evaluation was used. When
searching for pulsars at the frequency 111 MHz in the monitor -
ing data from Large Phased Array (LPA) of the Lebedev Physics
Institute (LPI) power spectra from time series of pulsed pul sar
emission summed over many days were used to increase sensiti vity
(Tyul’bashev et al. ,2017). It turned out that there may be character-
istic features in the power spectra the observed frequency o f which
is associated with periods of subpulse drift /u1D4432and/u1D4433. The ampli-
tude of successive harmonics, the ﬁrst of which is determine d by the
pulsar period /u1D4431, can decrease sometimes to the level of the noise,
then it begins to grow and decrease again. There are often sev eral
such “humps”. In the paper M18, such modulation was associated
with the drift period /u1D4432. The second feature in the power spectra
is harmonics-satellites, when an additional harmonic appe ars near
to the main harmonics. The spacing between the satellite har monic
and the main harmonic was related to the drift period /u1D4433. Using
the summed power spectra of 27 strongest pulsars in the decli nation
range+21◦< /u1D6FF <+42◦, in the work of M18 were obtained the
estimations of /u1D4432for 26 pulsars, and /u1D4433for 13 pulsars.
In this paper, the search for drift periods /u1D4432and/u1D4433is carried
out from the summed power spectra of 41 pulsars observed on de -
clinations from −9◦to+42◦. Summation of power spectra makes it
possible to signiﬁcantly increase S/N and identify weak det ails in the
power spectrum for a weak pulsars. As will be shown in our work ,
the analysis of the summed power spectrum makes it possible t o de-
termine the most frequently implemented drift parameters, including
the drift direction, most characteristic of a pulsar. It is k nown that for
a number of pulsars, the direction and drift parameters for s ub-pulses
can change over time W06 (Edwards & Stappers ,2003), which sig-
niﬁcantly complicates the overall picture. Our method allo ws, unlike
other methods, to determine the average parameters of pulsa r drift
over a long- time span. The simulation of the drift behavior o f pulses
from selected pulsars and the calculation of power spectra f rom them
was done, taking into account: the time interval of observat ions used
in one session, the period of pulsar, width of subpulses and t he mod-
ulation of the ﬂux density from pulse to pulse. The simulated power
spectra were compared with the power spectra obtained as a re sult of
summing the power spectra over many observation sessions, a nd/u1D4432
and/u1D4433were determined. We also revised the early estimates of /u1D4432
and/u1D4433from the paper M18.
2 MONITORING PROGRAM OF OBSERVATIONS AT THE
LPA LPI
LPA LPI antenna is an array built on wave dipoles. The signal c om-
ing from the dipole lines comes to the ﬁrst level of the ampliﬁ ers and
multiplies into four outputs. This makes it possible to crea te four inde-
pendent radio telescopes based on one antenna array. Of the a vailable
four outputs, one output is used for maintenance and quality control
of the antenna, and two outputs are used for scientiﬁc purpos es. That
is, two independent radio telescopes are currently operati ng on the
basis of one antenna. One of the radio telescopes is operatin g under a
long-term monitoring program. This radio telescope has 128 beams
located in the meridian plane and overlapping declinations from−9◦
to+55◦. For 96 beams, digital receivers were made in 2014 along
with the completion of the LPA upgrade, and the remaining bea mswere connected to the receivers in test mode less than a year a go.
LPA is a meridian type telescope. The observation time for on e day
(one session) is limited by the time the source passes throug h the
meridian and is approximately 3.5 minutes at half the power o f the
radiation pattern. Since monitoring is daily and round-the -clock, it
was possible to accumulate about ﬁve days of data for each poi nt in
the sky for an interval of 5.5 years (2057 power spectra).
The same monitoring data are used for research in two sci-
entiﬁc areas. Firstly, daily observations of several thous and radio
sources scintillating on the interplanetary plasma provid e a funda-
mental opportunity to predict “Space Weather” using an ante nna
array ( Shishov et al. ,2016). Secondly, observations are used to
search for pulsars and rotating radio transients ( Tyul’bashev et al. ,
2016;Tyul’bashev et al. ,2018) within the framework of the project
Pushchino Multibeams Pulsar Search (PUMPS, ( Tyul’bashev et al.
(2022)).Two modes are used simultaneously for the monitoring pro -
gram. In the ﬁrst mode, the recording is in the band 2.5 MHz in
six-channel mode with channel width 415 kHz and the sampling fre-
quency 10 Hz. In the second mode, data are recorded in thirty- two
channels in the 2.5 MHz band with a channel width of 78 kHz and
the sampling frequency of 80.0461 Hz. The time interval of ea ch
individual record is: /u1D447=204.682 s and, accordingly, the length of
the record is 16,384 points. The main task for this mode is to s earch
for pulsars and transients of the RRATs type. In this paper, w e use
the data obtained in the second mode. For each record we have a
sequence of pulses with a pulsar period /u1D4431. For each such record, we
calculated the power spectrum using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
As a result, we had 8192 points of the power spectrum for each s es-
sion, the ﬁrst (main) harmonic of which has the position /u1D447//u1D4431. The
time resolution was 12.4928 ms.
To increase the sensitivity, the search for pulsars is carri ed out us-
ing power spectra summed up over all monitoring data after ex clud-
ing records corrupted by interference and the ionosphere. I t turned
out that for some strong pulsars, more than 100 harmonics can be
observed in a summed power spectrum ( M18).
3 CRITERION FOR THE SELECTION OF POWER
SPECTRA
In the power spectrum, the ﬁrst “hump”, associated with the m od-
ulation of the main harmonics of the power spectrum and possi bly
caused by drift, can fall at the end of a power spectrum. For ex ample,
the position of the main harmonic in the power spectrum is deﬁ ned
as/u1D447//u1D4431, and for a pulsar with a period /u1D4431=100 ms it will be at
2,047 point. In total we have 8,192 points in the power spectr um.
Therefore the second harmonic will be at 4,094 point and only 4 har-
monics will be included in the full power spectrum. For a conﬁ dent
determination of /u1D4432, it is necessary to have more than 5 harmonics
to see modulation. For pulsars with a period less than 100 ms, the
search for /u1D4432in the monitoring data will be impossible. The cri-
terion for selecting pulsars to search for drift is using pul sars with
/u1D4431>200 ms, for which more than 8 harmonics can be observed in
the power spectrum for possible detection of harmonic modul ation.
In this case we can detect at least two “humps”. A total of 41 pu lsars
with/u1D446//u1D441 >10 were chosen for the ﬁrst harmonic in the power spec-
trum observed on declinations from −9◦to+42◦(the list of pulsars
see in the Appendix 7).
To obtain the summed power spectrum, high-quality data was
selected, and the rest was discarded. To do this, we calibrat ed the raw
data in the frequency channels using a calibration signal, w hich is
recorded 6 times a day in all beams. After that, the standard d eviations
MNRAS 000, 000–000 ( , 2023)Drift periods from summed power spectra 3
were evaluated and only those power spectra that improve the S/N
were selected for summation. All these procedures are reﬂec ted in
detail in the paper by ( Tyul’bashev et al. (2020).
4 DATA ANALYSIS
To obtain estimates of pulsar drift periods, we used the summ ed
power spectra after dispersion removal and gain equalizati on in fre-
quency channels. Before calculating the power spectra, the data were
cleaned from interference and the noise level was estimated . A cali-
bration signal of a known temperature is recorded every four hours.
This allows to calibrate data for diﬀerent days in the same un its. The
average value of noise sigma ( /u1D70E/u1D441) using the calibrated signal was
evaluated for each source independently and, if in this reco rd/u1D70E/u1D441
exceeded the speciﬁed noise level for this direction (see de tails in
the paper ( Tyul’bashev et al. (2020), then it was not used for further
processing. For each selected record, the power spectrum wa s calcu-
lated by the Fast Fourier Transform method (FFT). Then the po wer
spectra were summed up for all the observation sessions. As a result,
we had/u1D441/2 points of the average power spectrum with a resolution
ofΔ/u1D453=0.004886 Hz. The total number of power spectra summed
over ranged between 700 to 2,000.
4.1 Pulses drift model
For analysis of the summed up pulsar power spectra, we used th e
following model. A sequence of pulses with a pulsar period /u1D4431was
formed on the time interval /u1D447. It was assumed that the pulses have
a Gaussian shape, their amplitude and half-width at the leve l of 1/2
of the amplitude ( /u1D44A0.5) were set as a parameters. All pulsars studied
by us have small dispersion measures: less than 51 pc/cm3, so pulse
broadening due to scattering in interstellar plasma at a fre quency of
111 MHz is less than our time resolution (12.5 ms) and therefo re does
not aﬀect the shape of the pulse. The pulse amplitude distrib ution was
also a parameter. We considered 2 options: 1) constant pulse ampli-
tude with the value A, 2) randomly distributed pulse amplitu des,/u1D44E/u1D456,
according to the equation: /u1D44E/u1D456=(/u1D45F/u1D44E/u1D45B/u1D451−0.5) ×2/u1D434×0.01/u1D460/u1D45A/u1D45C/u1D451+/u1D434,
where/u1D460/u1D45A/u1D45C/u1D451 is the percentage of modulation (from 0 to 100%) and
/u1D45F/u1D44E/u1D45B/u1D451 is a random number from 0 to 1. We used here the random
number generator. The mean value of /u1D434used for simulation is 10
(in arbitrary units). /u1D4432can be either positive or negative. A negative
value of/u1D4432means that the subpulses appear earlier in successive
pulses (subpulses are shifted to the left, negative driftin g) or to the
right (/u1D4432is positive, positive drifting). Signs of /u1D4432therefore corre-
spond to the drift direction, such that a positive sign corre sponds to
positive drifting. One or two subpulses with a spacing betwe en them
equal to/u1D4432ms were set in each period having equal half-width and
amplitude. The phase shift of the pulses during one pulsar pe riod was
determined by the ratio /u1D4432//u1D4433, that is, after every /u1D4433pulsar periods
the phase of the next pulse returns to the initial position be fore the
shift. The direction of drift in the simulation was one of the parame-
ters. In the presence of one subpulse, 2 options were conside red: 1) in
the absence of the drift, it was assumed that /u1D4432is equal to zero, and
it does not shift in time; 2) the subpulse shifts with a veloci ty/u1D4432//u1D4433.
Based on the received sequence of pulses with or without drif t, the
power spectrum was calculated using FFT, and a comparison wa s
made with the resulting summed up power spectrum. In the powe r
spectrum /u1D4432will manifest itself as a periodic modulation of the main
harmonics of the power spectrum with a period /u1D458/u1D45D2=/u1D447//u1D4432./u1D4433will
appear as additional harmonic satellites at a spacing /u1D45F=/u1D447/(/u1D4433×/u1D4431)
from the main harmonics ( /u1D45Fis the spacing expressed in points, and/u1D458/u1D45D2is the number of points in the power spectrum of the ﬁrst “hump ”
of modulation).
Since we have a ﬁnite length of the data record /u1D447and, in most
cases, the ratio /u1D447//u1D4431is not an integer number, there is an additional
modulation of the harmonic amplitudes of the power spectrum . The
harmonic amplitude increases as /u1D458×(/u1D447//u1D4431)approaches to an integer
number (/u1D458is harmonic number). Let’s explain it with an example. If
/u1D447//u1D4431were an integer number, then the amplitude of harmonics in
the power spectrum would decrease in accordance with the Gau ssian
envelope, the half-width of which is proportional to the inv erse width
of the initial pulses. Fig. 1shows an example of such a model power
spectrum for a sequence of pulses with /u1D4431=2.0468 s, multiple of
/u1D447, and pulses half-width /u1D44A0.5=12.5 ms. For the point number in
the power spectrum /u1D45B≥6,000 the amplitude of harmonics drops
by more than 250 times, and it is possible to detect modulatio n as-
sociated with drift only for very strong pulsars. Fig. 2b shows an
example of a model power spectrum from a sequence of pulses wi th
the period /u1D4431=2.0915 s without drift (the period corresponds to
PSR J0928+3037) and /u1D44A0.5=12.5 ms. In this case /u1D447//u1D4431=97.845
and 6th, 7th, 8th harmonics, and also multiples of them, have the
values of the position of harmonics closest to an integer num bers
/u1D458/u1D447//u1D4431: 587.07, 684,92,782.76, which leads to their local maxima.
Accordingly, periodic modulation of harmonic amplitudes a ppears,
which is not associated with pulses drift. Fig. 2a shows the summed
up power spectrum obtained from observations, on which the s ame
harmonic modulation is visible. The absence of the thirteen th har-
monic is caused by interference and it was deleted. For model pulses,
the half-width /u1D44A0.5=12.5 ms, is mainly used, which adequately
characterizes the real width of individual pulses (25 ms tot al width
at the level of 1 /2 of maximum) at our sampling time 12.5 ms. The
pulse width does not aﬀect the simulation results. However w e should
point that the amplitude of harmonics will be modiﬁed depend ing
on width, which should have some eﬀect on the power spectral p rop-
erties. The amplitude of the harmonics will go as ∼/u1D44A2
0.5and the
half-width of the harmonic distribution in the power spectr um will
be proportional to 1 //u1D44A0.5. This was veriﬁed by simulating pulses
with diﬀerent /u1D44A0.5. Even the width shows variation between dif-
ferent data and pulsars, the summed up power spectrum reﬂect s an
average width of the pulses in the observation range.
Modeling has shown that random variations in the amplitudes of
the initial pulses have little eﬀect on the distribution of t he amplitudes
of the power spectrum harmonics (see Fig. 3). It can be seen from the
ﬁgure that the model arrays describe the observations quite well.
4.2 The occurrence of drift in power spectra
Fig.4shows an example of the summed up power spectrum (Fig. 4a)
and model power spectra for J1313+0931: without drift (Fig. 4b) and
with drift (Fig. 4c). The value of /u1D4432corresponds to the harmonic
with the number /u1D447//u1D4432=1,895, at which the ﬁrst maximum in the
distribution of harmonics is observed. Since there are no ad ditional
harmonic satellites in the observed power spectrum next to t he main
ones, it means that /u1D45F(distance to the main harmonic in points) ≤2 (we
just won’t see the extra harmonic), accordingly /u1D4433>/u1D447/(2/u1D4431), this is
true for this model ( /u1D447/(/u1D4433/u1D4431)=1.98), but there is a deep modulation
of harmonics. It can be seen from the simulation that the drif t-free
model agrees much better with the observations. Let us note t hat
in the presence of a two-component structure of the average p roﬁle,
even without pulse drift, a deep modulation of harmonics ass ociated
with the distance between subpulses will also be observed in the
power spectrum. It is obvious that the observed “humps” in th e power
spectra can be associated with the real drift of subpulses, b ut this is

not a suﬃcient condition for a conclusion about drift. Modul ation
of the amplitudes of the power spectrum harmonics can also oc cur
due to the fact that /u1D447//u1D4431is not an integer number, as shown above
(see Fig. 2). When deﬁning parameters /u1D4432and/u1D4433, it is necessary to
take into account these eﬀects. As the simulation shows, the drift
manifests itself in a power spectrum as the appearance of add itional
harmonics to the left or right of the main harmonics, dependi ng
on the direction of drift. Sometimes additional harmonic sa tellites
appear both to the left and to the right of the main harmonic, b ut their
amplitudes can diﬀer signiﬁcantly. Period sign /u1D4432is determined by
a harmonic with a larger amplitude.

ture of a average proﬁle with a distance between the componen ts at a
frequency of 111 MHz equal to190 ms and a half-width componen ts
equal to 22 ms ( Smirnova et al. ,2009). The simulation calculation
of the power spectrum for the 2-component structure with a di stance
of 190 ms without drift (Fig. 5b) and with drift to the beginning of
the proﬁle (Fig. 6) shows a visible good agreement with the summed
up power spectrum for both models. However, the inclusion of drift
leads to a rapid decrease in the amplitude of the main harmoni cs
and to the dominance of harmonics shifted from the main ones b y

the second “hump”, only the shifted harmonics remain and the main
harmonics are practically not visible. The appearance of di splaced

if there is a regular drift. In the paper M18,/u1D4432and/u1D4433have been
determined for this pulsar, they correspond to the paramete rs used by
us for the model with drift (Fig. 6). InM18 a smaller accumulation of
power spectra was used, and in their Fig. 4there is a weak harmonic
to the right of the main one, located at a distance correspond ing to
/u1D4433, and, consequently, the direction of drift is towards the be ginning
of the proﬁle ( /u1D4432is negative). This pulsar, as noted in the paper W06
(Table 2), belongs to the class Dif* and has diﬀerent drift di rections
and signiﬁcantly diﬀerent values of /u1D4432for two proﬁle components.
The model describes well the obtained power spectrum with pa ram-
eters:/u1D4432=−190±16 ms and /u1D4433=4.9±0.2/u1D4431agree well with

ponents of the average proﬁle. In W06 was noted that for the other
component, the drift goes in the other direction ( /u1D4432is positive), and
the analysis gives a wide component in a two-dimensional spe ctrum.
The model we use assumes a regular drift, which is not observe d in

On the top is a part of this power spectrum without nulling. On the bottom is
the same for modelling pulses with 45% nulling duration. The designation of
the axes is the same as in Fig. 1
visible on the right near the main one, and we do not have it wit h a
large averaging of the power spectra.
The pulsar B0525+21 has a nulling fraction of 25% ( Wang et al. ,
2007). Our model can account for this eﬀect. Simulation of pulses
with diﬀerent nulling durations (up to 50%) and drift parame ters
showed that the amplitude distribution of harmonics and the position
of satellites in the power spectrum does not change, but the a mplitude
of all harmonics decreases depending on the nulling length. Sessions
with a small fraction of nullings will have the greatest cont ribution to
the power spectrum accumulated over many sessions. The exam ple of
spectra for modelling pulses with 45% nulling duration and w ithout
it can be seen from Fig. 7. Oﬀ-pulse emission has been reported for
this pulsar ( Basu et al. (2011) but ( Marcote et al. (2019) conducted
very-high-resolution radio observations of B0525+21 and c oncluded
that the oﬀ-pulse emission should be less than 0.4% of the per iod-
averaged pulsed ﬂux density. In any case, adding a constant l evel of
radiation outside the pulses will not aﬀect the power spectr um.
In the summed up power spectrum of the pulsar J0034-0721
(B0031-07) (Fig. 8) both the modulation of the main harmonics (be-
low) and the satellite harmonics (above) are clearly visibl e. The
period/u1D4433is determined by the distance /u1D45Ffrom the main harmonic:
/u1D4433=/u1D447/(/u1D45F/u1D4431). On the obtained power spectrum in the range of point
numbers up to 2,700, additional harmonics are not visible. T he am-
plitude of the main ones becomes noticeable, and at the same t ime
additional harmonics appear on the right at /u1D45B >2,700 the amplitude
of which is about 2 times higher than the main harmonics. The c enter
of the wide modulation envelope falls on n =3,255 which corre sponds
to/u1D4432=−63 ms. The satellite harmonics are located to the right of
the main harmonic at a distance of /u1D45F=16 points which corresponds
to the value of /u1D4433=13.6/u1D4431and the drift occurs towards the begin-
ning of the pulse, i.e. /u1D4432is negative. The analysis of the summed
up power spectra shown in Fig. 8gives the value /u1D4433=13.6±0.4/u1D4431,
corresponding to the drift A mode. Diﬀerent drift modes for t his
pulsar will be discussed in Section 5.
The simulation shows that always when the direction of the dr ift
of the pulses goes to the beginning of the proﬁle ( /u1D4432is negative)
the satellite harmonic with higher amplitudes appears to th e right
of the main harmonic, and when the drift is towards the end of
it (/u1D4432is positive) – to the left. Fig. 9demonstrate this behavior of
satellite harmonics. Here an example of models with paramet ers

= 0.943 s, /u1D4432= -63 ms, /u1D4433= 13.6/u1D4431. On the top, it is a part of this power
spectrum with satellite harmonics to the right of the main ha rmonics. The
main harmonics are smaller than the modulation ones by about two times.
The designation of the axes is the same as in Fig. 1
for J0034-0721 is shown for two cases: with a drift towards th e
beginning of the proﬁle ( /u1D4432=−63 ms (Fig. 9b)) and towards the
end of the proﬁle ( /u1D4432=+63 ms, Fig. 9c),/u1D4433=13.6/u1D4431. Panel b in
Fig.9corresponds to the summed up power spectrum. In Fig. 9b,c, the
ﬁrst harmonics of the power spectrum are shown, increased in scale
by 4 times, with the same scale for the horizontal axis. The sh ifted
harmonics associated with the drift period /u1D4433, have a signiﬁcantly
lower amplitude compared to the main harmonics at the beginn ing
of the power spectrum. For /u1D4432=−63 ms, the satellite harmonic is
located to the right of the main harmonic at a distance of 16 po ints,
and for/u1D4432=63 ms, it is to the left at the same distance as it should be
when the drift is in diﬀerent directions. In Fig. 9a the power spectrum
is shown in a wider range. For this power spectrum in the modul ation
“hump”, only harmonics with oﬀset by /u1D45F=16 points are visible,
the amplitude of which exceeds the main harmonics by 10 times or
more.
Consequently, the most accurate deﬁnition of /u1D4433is determination
of the shifted harmonics position to the right or left from th e main
ones associated with the period /u1D4431. The position /u1D45Fis determined with
the precision of a discrete bin (up to one point), therefore, we will
assume that it is no worse than ±1/2 of the discrete bin. Our each
discrete bin is 0.004886 Hz (1 //u1D447). Accuracy of /u1D4432determination is
related to the accuracy of ﬁnding the centers of the “humps” o f the
slow modulation of the power spectra. We assume that the erro r in/u1D4432
is determined with an accuracy of ±one harmonic from the center
position of the modulation envelope. The obtained paramete rs for/u1D4432
and/u1D4433with their errors are given in Table 1.
5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the paper M18 where the new technique was proposed and tested,
it was found that almost all the pulsars studied have modulat ion of
the amplitudes of the main harmonics in the power spectra. Th is
was interpreted as the presence of subpulses drifting and us ed to
determine the value of /u1D4432. The detection of satellites of harmonic
peaks in power spectra made it possible to measure the period /u1D4433.

and the time interval /u1D447has shown that determined period /u1D4432inM18
from modulation of power spectrum harmonics is not associat ed
with drift for 18 pulsars. The amplitude distribution of har monics
for them is explained by the corresponding value of /u1D45B=/u1D458/u1D447//u1D4431.
This eﬀect was considered in Section 4.1. The list of these pul-
sars is as follow: J0613+3721, J0826+2637, J0928+30, J1136 +1551,
J1635+2418, J1741+2758, J1758+3030, J1813+4013, J1907+4 002,
J1912+2525, J2018+2839, J2055+2209, J2113+2754, J2139+2 242,
J2208+4056, J2234+2114, J2305+3100, J2317+2149. In the pa per
M18, the sign of the drift period /u1D4432was not determined, and in
this work, we present it for pulsars in which the values of /u1D4433are
measured.
The presence of modulation in the power spectrum indicates e ither
drift or the presence of subpulses with a distance between th em which
corresponds to the position of the maximum of this modulatio n. There
may be cases when the drift may be present, but it is not regula r or is
very slow with /u1D4433/greaterorsimilar/u1D447/(2/u1D4431)and we cannot see shifted harmonics
relative to the main ones ( /u1D45F/lessorsimilar2). Note that for J1921+2153, we
got only the upper estimate of /u1D4432but we cannot exclude values of
/u1D4432/lessorsimilar40 ms because in this case /u1D458/u1D45D2/greaterorsimilar5000 and amplitude will
be small. We got the value of /u1D4433=4.1/u1D4431which correcpondings to
the satellite harmonic shifted to the right of the main harmo nics (/u1D4432
is negative). The obtained power spectrum of PSR J1921+2153 is
shown in Fig. 10. PSR J0826+2637 has a satellites of a small equal
amplitude (Fig. 10top). On both sides of the main harmonics and
we have deﬁned /u1D4433indicated in Table 1. There is no modulation
corresponding to period /u1D4432(Backer ,1970) found that this pulsar
shows drifting in bursts, but the drift direction is diﬀeren t for diﬀerent
bursts. Our value of /u1D4433is in a good agreement with the value of
W06. The postcursor and interpulse known for this pulsar have sm all
amplitudes: 30 and 65 times less than the amplitude of the mai n pulse
at a frequency of 111 MHz ( Toropov et al. ,2024). In addition, the
postcursor does not separate well from the main pulse with ou r time
resolution of 12.5 ms. Therefore, these proﬁle components d o not
aﬀect the total power spectrum.

are also shown in the table.
As can be seen from Table 1, for those sources for which there
are no harmonic satellites in the power spectrum, we only giv e the
value of /u1D4432without sign, while for pulsars with a positive value
of/u1D4432, we put the sign “+” (for case we got the value for /u1D4433). For
J0304+1932, J1136+1551 and J2046+1540 in the paper W06 pe-
riod/u1D4433was determined, whereas it could not be determined from
observations on the LPA. These three pulsars belong to the cl ass
“Dif*” and, therefore, have unstable drift and wide details in the
2DFS spectrum. For J1136+1551 and J0528+2250 measured valu es
of/u1D4432correspond to the distance between the components at our
frequency, as indicated above. Only one pulsar J0323+3944 f rom
the table belongs to the class “Coh”, and for it, the drift par ame-
ters are consistent within the error limits with the data in t he pa-
perW06. Fig. 11shows part of the summed up power spectrum for
PSR J0323+3944. In this power spectrum, it is clearly seen th at
while the amplitude of the main harmonics is falling, the amp litude
of the left-shifted harmonics associated with /u1D4433don’t decrease and
they become predominant. For 11 pulsars: J0034-0721, J0304 +1932,
J0323+3944, J0528+2200, J1136+1551, J1239+2452, J1532+2 745,
J1722+35, J1921+2153, J2046+1540, and J2227+3030 we have d e-
ﬁned or redeﬁned the drift period /u1D4432. For 7 sources: J0034-0721,
J0323+3944, J0611+3016, J0826+2637, J1239+2452, J1921+2 153,
and J2234+2114 drift direction and /u1D4433value were determined.
For 9 pulsars from Table 1, estimates of /u1D4432were previously ob-
tained in the paper W06, and only for four of them (J0323+3944,
J0528+2200, J1239+2452, and J1921+2153) our estimates coi ncide
within the error limits. For J1921+2153 our upper limit for /u1D4432doesn’t
contradict with a value from W06. J0034-0721 and J0304+1932 have
a large errors for /u1D4432inW06 so it is diﬃcult to compare its values.
In the paper W06 seven of these 9 pulsars were identiﬁed as “Dif”
or “Dif*”, that is having no coherent drift. An unusual power spec-
trum is observed for J0611+3016. It can be seen from Fig. 12that
the harmonics due to the periodic emission of the pulsar have a low-
level detail shifted to the left of the fundamental harmonic . The shift
was deﬁned as the diﬀerence from the maximum of it. According
to its shift, /u1D4433period was determined, listed in Table 1. The period
/u1D4432could not be determined because there is no expressed modula -

tion in the power spectrum. There appears to be an irregular d rift of
subpulses towards the tail of the proﬁle.
We used the simplest assumptions about subpulse drift to det er-
mine by simulated power spectra. In reality, drift behavior can be
signiﬁcantly more complicated. It is known that drift can be non-
linear: two subpulses can have diﬀerent velocities and dire ction,
jumps in the phase of subpulses ( Edwards & Stappers ,2003), also
the speed and direction of the drift can change over time. Pul sar
J0034-0721 is known to have 3 drift modes A, B, C ( Huguenin et al. ,
1970), and the slope of the drift bands may vary from one band
to another. In the paper ( Huguenin et al. ,1970) parameters /u1D4432and
/u1D4433have been determined for these modes: /u1D4432=−56±6 ms,
/u1D4433=12.5±0.5/u1D4431(A mode); /u1D4432=−58±10 ms,/u1D4433=6.8±0.8/u1D4431
(B mode); /u1D4432=+56±12 ms,/u1D4433=4±0.5/u1D4431ms (C mode). The
rarest was “C” mode. In the paper W06 it is noted that in “A” drift
mode, pulsar has higher power ( /u1D4433=12/u1D4431) and signiﬁcantly lower
power in “B” mode ( /u1D4433=6/u1D4431), and there is no detail corresponding
to “C” mode. Pulsar J0034-0721 has a mode-changing behavior and
the range in /u1D4432quoted in W06 is most likely because of that. The
paper of the ( McSweeney et al. ,2019) also indicates 3 drift modes,
of which A mode has the same period /u1D4433=12.5±0.8/u1D4431as we have
(/u1D4433=13.6±0.4/u1D4431). J0034-0721 has a nulling fraction of 45%
(McSweeney et al. ,2019). Nullings can be for 50 or 150 pulsar peri-
ods and then for 400 /u1D4431they are not (Fig. 3 from ( McSweeney et al.
(2019)). Our one session has a duration of 3.4 minutes and diﬀerent
nulling duration will be implemented on diﬀerent days. With the ac-
cumulation of power spectra, the days with the smallest frac tion of
nulling during the observation will make the greatest contr ibution to
the total power spectrum. Simulation of pulses with obtaine d drift
parameters for J0034-0721 ( /u1D4432= -63 ms and /u1D4433= 13.6/u1D4431) and a
nulling of 45% showed that nulling does not aﬀect the analysi s of our
power spectrum (see Fig. 7). It is clear that our simple model does
not describe the complex behavior of drifting subpulses, bu t it ex-plains the resulting summed up power spectrum quite well, co rrectly
determines the drift direction and position of the harmonic satellites
relative to the main harmonics. The power spectrum accumula ted
over a long period of time reﬂects the most frequently realiz ed drift
parameters. In this case, the obtained drift parameters are consistent
with the drift mode “A”, which means that it is most often mani fested
for J0034-0721.
For J0304+1932 in the paper W06 there is a wide drift detail in
2DFS for the tail component of the proﬁle till the boundary of the
spectrum (2 /u1D4431, Nyquist frequency), but there is no drift in the main
component. For J1136+1551, period /u1D4433also has a value close to 2 /u1D4431,
and as for J0304+1932, /u1D4432, determined in W06, have large values
of/u1D4432which most likely indicate amplitude modulation, not phase
modulation as it was pointed in W06. Nonlinear drift or random
changes in the direction of drift during observation can als o lead to
large values of /u1D4432. As noted in W06, J2046+1540 has a wide drift
detail for the tail component, as well as the value of /u1D4433may vary
relative to the average value during observations. In our pa per/u1D4433is
not determined.
For four sources: J0928+3037, J1635+2418, J2018+2839, and
J2305+3100, observed in M18, period /u1D4433is not conﬁrmed in
our analysis. J0928+3037 and J1635+2418 were not reported i n
W06. J2018+2839 has 2 diﬀerent drift modes in W06. For PSR
J2305+3100, the detail in the power spectrum ( W06) splits in the
vicinity of the Nyquist frequency: /u1D4433=2/u1D4431, and this is interpreted
as the presence of two directions of drift. The direction of d rift
changes during observation. Out of the 41 pulsars in our list , 9 have
measurements of /u1D4433inW06. We did not detect /u1D4433for three of them.
All these sources belong to the class “Dif*” and have a comple x
pattern of drift. For 5 pulsars from our Table 1we have a good agree-
ment/u1D4433values with W06 and (Huguenin et al. (1970). The literature
provides an analysis of the drift behavior of pulsars based o n single
observations over a period of several hours at best. Based on such
MNRAS 000, 000–000 ( , 2023)Drift periods from summed power spectra 9
observations, it is diﬃcult to conclude what part of the time the pul-
sar is in one or another drift mode for a long time. As a rule, ou r total
power spectrum reﬂects the most frequently realized drift m ode over
an interval of about 5 years (total observation time).
6 CONCLUSIONS
For the search of drift periods, the summed up power spectra o f
known pulsars, obtained by us as a result of processing monit oring
data, were considered. Our work is devoted to the study of the drift
behavior of pulsar pulses. It is a logical development of the method
of using the summed up power spectra of pulsars to measure the drift
periods of subpulses ( M18). Our analysis showed that drift behavior
was not detected for most of the pulsars studied. The distrib ution of
the amplitudes of the main harmonics in many cases does not di ﬀer
from their distribution without the presence of drift. The s ummed
up power spectra of pulsars in the presence of drift are also w ell
described by the proposed model. In the later case, the drift is man-
ifested by the presence of modulation of the main harmonics i n the
power spectrum, with the frequency inverse to /u1D4432. The period /u1D4433
manifests itself in the summed up power spectra as additiona l har-
monics shifted from the main harmonics in one direction or th e other.
The amplitude of these harmonics may exceed the amplitude of the
main ones. The presence of these harmonics on the left means t hat
the subpulses drift to the beginning of the proﬁle ( /u1D4432is negative). A
shift to the right means that the drift occurs towards the end of the
proﬁle(/u1D4432is positive).
The drift parameters obtained from the accumulated power sp ectra
correspond to the drift behavior most often realized over a l ong
period of observations. Apparently, there are few pulsars w ith regular
coherent drift. This follows from the paper W06, in which out of 42
pulsars with drift behavior, only 19 show narrow details in t wo-
dimensional spectra (class “Coh” – coherent), moreover, 7 o f them
have 2 values of /u1D4432signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each other, but having
the same /u1D4433. Accordingly, the rate of displacement of subpulses
changes quite sharply over time. In the power spectra accumu lated
over many days, such drift behavior, of course, will not give a clear
picture. Our analysis showed that the model power spectra of pulsars
without drift describe well the summed up power spectra obta ined for
18 pulsars in M18 and, thereby, signiﬁcantly reduced the number of
sources with a conﬁrmed period /u1D4432that was reported by M18. Using
the considered technique, it was possible to determine the p eriod/u1D4432
for 11 out of 68 pulsars were studied on LPA LPI. The drift dire ction
and/u1D4433value we got for 7 pulsars. Among 13 sources common with
paper W06, for ﬁve sources /u1D4432is not determined, for ﬁve pulsars the
values coincide with the previously reported measurements , and for
three pulsars they do not coincide. The period /u1D4433could be measured
for 9 pulsars. Among these out of 8 sources common with the wor k
ofW06, the period coincides for 5 sources, and for three it is not
determined.
