Abstract. We investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium of white dwarfs within the framework
of Rastall-Rainbow gravity, aiming to explore the effects of this modified gravitational theory
on their properties. By employing the Chandrasekhar equation of state in conjunction with
the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we derive the mass-radius relations for
white dwarfs. Our results show that the maximum mass of white dwarfs deviates significantly
from the predictions of general relativity, potentially exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.
Furthermore, we discuss other properties of white dwarfs, such as the gravitational redshift,
compactness and dynamical stability, shedding light on their behavior within the context of
this modified gravitational framework.

1 Introduction
Einstein’s general relativity (GR), proposed a century ago, is a successful theory of gravity
which has helped us understand many aspects of the universe. In particular, some experi-
mental tests from weak gravity, as well as recent observations like the shadows of black holes
and gravitational waves by binary stars mergers, have strongly supported GR. Nonetheless,
there are some phenomena at the larger (cosmological) scale that are not well described in
the context of GR. For example, GR fails to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe
without further refinement. To overcome this limitation, two possibilities were proposed. One
is that there is a large amount of dark energy with negative pressure in the universe. The
other is that GR’s predictions may be biased on the cosmological scale, so alternative theo-
ries of gravity were proposed, such as massive gravity [1], Brans-Dicke gravity [2] and f(R)
gravity [3].
Additionally, Rastall [4] proposed a possible modified theory of gravity. Rastall ar-
gued that current experiments merely verified the vanishing of the covariant derivative of
the energy-momentum tensor in flat spacetimes, without necessarily holding true in curved
spacetime. Thus, Rastall replaced the energy-momentum tensor conservation law in GR by
assuming that the covariant divergence of the energy-momentum tensor varies proportionally
to the gradient of the Ricci scalar. In the past few years, Rastall gravity has attracted atten-
tion from researchers due to its potential to explain some phenomena in the universe [5–8].
Recently, several works have been done to test Rastall gravity by studying compact stars with
strong gravitational fields. Some solutions of black hole in the Rastall gravity are obtained
in Refs. [9–14], as well as various physical properties of these black holes have been exten-
sively studied [15, 16]. Oliveira et al., [17] first obtained the modified equilibrium equation in
this gravity, and discussed the effects of Rastall parameter on the structure of neutron stars.
Ghosh et al., [18] investigated gravastars in Rastall gravity. In the literatures [19, 20], the
authors studied anisotropic compact stars in Rastall gravitational framework using Karori-
Barua metric or Tolman-Kuchowicz metric. Quark stars and quintessence compact stars were
discussed in Refs. [21, 22].
– 1 –Rainbow gravity was proposed by Magueijo and Smolin [23], who incorporate double
specialrelativityintotheframeworkofGR.Recently, Motaetal.[24]combinedRastallgravity
with Rainbow theory and employed the modern equation of state (EoS) of nuclear matter
to derive models of neutron stars. They concluded that slight changes in both parameters
of this theory of gravity have a substantial impact on the structure of the neutron star.
Subsequently, anisotropic neutron stars in this gravitational background was studied [25].
Charged anisotropic strange stars and charged gravastars in Rastall-Rainbow gravity were
investigated in Refs. [26, 27].
White dwarfs are extraordinarily dense celestial bodies that formed from the collapse of
stellar stars following the complete depletion of their nuclear fuel within the central region.
The study of white dwarfs has been crucial in advancing our understanding of stellar evolution
and the physics of compact objects. In the past few years, a lot of researches have been
conducted on the relationship between the mass and radius of white dwarfs, revealing that the
existence of an upper mass limit known as the Chandrasekhar mass limit [28, 29]. However,
some recently observed peculiar over-luminous type-Ia supernovae, such as SN 2007if, SN
2006gz, SN 2003fg and SN 2009DC [30, 31], predicted the existence of white dwarfs with
masses ranging from 2.1 M⊙to 2.8 M⊙(M⊙is the mass of the Sun) [32–35]. In order to
explain the formation mechanism of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs, extensive research
investigated white dwarfs in various contexts, such as super strong uniform magnetized white
dwarfs [36–40], white dwarfs in modified theories of gravity [41–51], electrical charged white
dwarfs [52, 53] and rotating white dwarfs [54, 55]. In this work, we explore the behavior of
white dwarfs within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity, specifically investigating the
potential existence of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs within this modified gravitational
theory.
This article is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly review Rastall gravity and
Rainbow gravity, and proceed to derive the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV)
equation within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. In Sec. III, we recall the Chan-
drasekhar EoS. In Sec. IV, we solve modified TOV equation numerically and present the
mass-radius relations for white dwarfs in Rastall-Rainbow gravity. In Sec. V, some prop-
erties of white stars are investigated, including the gravitational redshift, compactness and
dynamic stability. Finally, summary is given in Sec. VI.
2 Basic equations of Rastall-Rainbow gravity
2.1 Rastall-Rainbow gravity
Double special relativity was proposed due to the existence of the minimum observable length,
which requires the speed of light and the Planck energy remain constant in the low energy
limit. Consequently, the energy-momentum dispersion relation for a particle of mass mcan
be written in the following general form
E2∆2(ε)−p2Θ2(ε) =m2, (2.1)
where ε=E/E pis the ratio of the particle’s energy Eto the Planck constant Ep.pis the
particle’s momentum. ∆(ε)andΘ(ε)are known as the rainbow functions, and they satisfy
the conditions
lim
ε→0∆(ε) = 1 ,lim
ε→0Θ(ε) = 1 ; (2.2)
– 2 –Magueijo and Smolin integrated the double special relativity into the framework of general
relativity to propose Rainbow gravity. In this proposal, the modified metric can be written
as
g(ε) =ηabea(ε)⊗eb(ε), (2.3)
where ea(ε)andeb(ε)are the energy-dependent orthonormal frame fields, and their expres-
sions are as follows
e0(ε) =1
∆(ε)e0, e i(x) =1
Θ(ε)ei; (2.4)
According to the above description, the spherical symmetry metric in Rainbow gravity can
be written as
ds2=−e2ν
∆(ε)2dt2+e2λ
Θ(ε)2dr2+r2
Θ(ε)2(dθ2+ sin θ2dϕ2), (2.5)
where e2νande2λare radial functions. Obviously, the spherically symmetric metric is related
to the rainbow function, so it depends on the energy of the probe particle.
According to Rastall’s proposal, the conservation law for the energy-momentum tensor
may not hold true in curved spacetime, and it should be rewritten as
∇µTµν=1−κ
16πG∇νR , (2.6)
where κis a constant called Rastall parameter, which measures the deviation from GR and
describes the affinity of the matter field to couple with geometry. The field equation in
Rastall’s gravity can be written as
Rµν−κ
2gµνR= 8πGT µν; (2.7)
2.2 Hydrostatic equilibrium equation in Rastall-Rainbow gravity
Mota et al [8] first combined the above two modified gravitational theories and derived the
Hydrostatic equilibrium equations. Next, we introduce the modified TOV equation in this
gravitational theory. The field equations in Rastall-Rainbow is
Rµν(ε)−κ
2gµνR(ε) = 8 πG(ε)Tµν(ε) ; (2.8)
In this investigation, we consider the isotropic perfect fluid whose energy-momentum tensor
is
Tµν= (P+c2ρ)UµUν−Pgµν, (2.9)
where Pandρdenote the pressure and the energy density of the fluid, respectively, while Uµ
corresponds to the four-velocity.
By employing Eqs. (2.5) and (2.9), we can express the components of the energy-
momentum tensor in the four-dimensional spacetime as

0=ρc2, T1
1=T2
2=T3

Here we assumed that χ=κ−1. The differential equations Eqs. (2.11)-(2.13) are similar to
those obtained in GR. Thus, the expression of the function e−2λcan be obtained by directly
integrating Eq. (2.11), as
e−2λ= 1−2Gm(r)

where m(r)is the gravitational mass within the sphere of radius r. An additional equation
related to the metric function ν(r)is obtained from Eq. (2.6) and reads

The expression for dν/dris derived from Eqs. (2.11) and (2.17), and it is brought into
Eq. (2.18), one can obtain the modified TOV equations in Rastall-Rainbow gravity as

Naturally, by setting the parameter χ= 0, that is, α= 1andβ= 0, the modified TOV

GR is recovered.

4 Numerical results
Some recently observed peculiar over-luminous SNIa predict the mass of white dwarfs to be
between 2.1 M⊙and 2.8 M⊙. Therefore, the upper limit of the white dwarf’s mass is still
an open question. In the following, we delve into the properties of white dwarfs within the
context of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. The objective is to determine whether this gravitational
model can account for the existence of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. In this section,
the results for white dwarfs are presented using the Chandrasekhar EoS given in the previous
subsection. The mass and radius of white stars are obtained by numerically integrating the
modified TOV equations Eqs. (2.19) and (2.20). Here, we set the boundary conditions at the
center of the star (r= 0)as
ρ(0) = ρc, and M (0) = 0 , (4.1)
where ρcis the central energy density. The integral is interrupted on the surface of the white
dwarf, where the pressure disappears ( P(R) = 0), the corresponding RandM(R)are the
radius and total mass of the white dwarf. First, Fig. 1 shows the behavior of the mass against
the radius from the center to the surface of the star for ρc= 1×1012kg/m3. Our results
indicate that as the radius increases, the mass of the white dwarf increases. Furthermore, the
mass obtained in the case of GR is the smallest compared to other scenarios.
Next, we present the mass-radius relations for white dwarfs within the framework of
Rastall gravity, depicted in the left panel of Fig. 2. Here, we consider a fixed rainbow param-
eter∆ = 0, while varying the parameter χin the range of 0to6×10−5. Notably, for χ= 0
(the blue solid line), the mass and radius of the white dwarf return to the results obtained in
the general relativity, where the maximum mass M= 1.41M⊙is close to the Chandrasekhar
limit. The other three curves represent the Rastall gravity case, which demonstrates that
the maximum mass of white dwarfs exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit and increases with an
increase in χ. For example, in the case of χ= 4×10−5, the maximum mass increases to
1.48M⊙. The right panel of Fig. 2 shows the mass-center density relations, and the black dots

in the figure mark the position of the maximum mass. According to the Harrison-Zeldovich
Novikov criterion, dM/dϵ c>0corresponds to a stable configuration, while dM/dϵ c<0is
unstable one. The results show that in the scenario where χ <6×10−5, the mass of the white
dwarf increases with the center density until reaching the maximum mass, indicating a state
of stability. Beyond this point, the mass exhibits a decreasing trend with the center density.
It is notable that, for χ= 6×10−5, the mass decreases monotonically with the central density,
implying that these white dwarf models are unstable. Consequently, the Chandrasekhar limit
in Rastall gravity is estimated to be M≈1.51M⊙, with detailed data provided in Table 1.
Finally, we investigate the effect of the rainbow parameter ∆on the properties of white
dwarfs, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Here we fix χ= 2×10−5and vary the value
of∆. The results indicate that when considering the effect of the Rainbow parameter ∆,
the maximum mass of white dwarfs is larger compared to that in Rastall gravity. It can be
seen that super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs can be obtained for some specific values of the
Rainbow parameters. For example, in the case of ∆ = 1 .5, the maximum mass of the white

dwarf is 2.14M⊙. Meanwhile, considering the upper limit of the super-Chandrasekhar white
dwarf mass as 2.8M⊙, we can constrain the value of the rainbow parameter to ∆upper = 2. In
this scenario, the maximum mass reaches 2.86M⊙. For more detailed analysis, Fig. 4 shows
theequi−Mmaxcontours in ∆−χplane. It can be observed that larger values of χand
∆facilitate the attainment of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs, and ∆upperexhibiting a
decrease as the Rastall parameter χincreases.
5 Structure properties of white dwarfs
5.1 Gravitational redshift and compactness
The gravitational redshift provides a direct measurement of the gravitational field strength
near the compact star, aiding in a understanding of gravitational properties under extreme
conditions. Moreover, it serves as a significant probe for investigating the EoS of compact

where σis the compactness of compact stars, which is defined as

The compactness and gravitational redshift of white dwarfs are given in the last two columns
of Table 1 and 2. As can be seen from the above two tables, the gravitational redshift and
compactness decrease with the increase of parameter χ, while the rainbow parameter ∆has
no significant impact on these properties.
5.2 Dynamical stability

the stability of white dwarfs. Chandrasekhar first studied the dynamical stability of stellar
models against infinitesimal radial adiabatic perturbation [56]. Heintzmann and Hillebrandt
conducted calculations [57] and established that for compact objects to be dynamically stable
at any position, the adiabatic index must exceed4

the different values of the parameters χand∆are over 1.33, which means that these white
dwarf models are dynamically stable.

6 Summary
Super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs are compact stellar remnants that exceed the standard
mass limit. The supernova explosions triggered by these unusually massive white dwarfs
exhibit distinct spectral and luminosity characteristics, making them significant for studying
theirproperties. InRefs[41–51],authorsobtainedmassivewhitedwarfsbyconsideringvarious
modified gravitational theories. Motivated by this, we investigate white dwarfs in Rastall-
Rainbow gravity.
We numerically solve the modified TOV equation with Chandrasekhar EoS, resulting in
the derivation of the mass-radius relations for white dwarfs under varying parameters of χand
∆. It was demostrated that the parameters of Rastall-Rainbow gravity have significant effects
on the structure of white dwarfs. In the realm of Rastall gravity, when χ > 1×10−5, the
maximum mass of white dwarfs exhibits a substantial deviation from the predictions of GR,
with a noticeable upward trend as χincreases. For the case of χ= 4×10−5, the maximum
mass increases to 1.48M⊙, which is larger than the Chandrasekhar limit. Based on the fact
that the structure of white dwarfs is unstable at χ > 6×10−5, we can conclude that the
Chandrasekhar limit in Rastall gravity is Mmax= 1.51M⊙. Futhermore, we fix χ= 2×10−5
and vary the value of rainbow parameter ∆. the results show that super-Chandrasekhar white
dwarfs can be obtained by increasing the value of rainbow parameter ∆. We can constrain
∆<2due to that the upper limit of the super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf’s mass is 2.8M⊙.
Next, we investigate the gravitational redshift and compactness of white dwarfs and find
thattheydecreasewiththeincreaseoftheparameter χ, buthavenosignificantdependenceon
the rainbow parameter ∆. Finally, we confirm that these white dwarf models are dynamically
stable by analyzing the adiabatic index.
