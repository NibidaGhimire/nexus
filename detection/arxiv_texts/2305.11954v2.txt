A cyclically dominating three-species ecosystem, modeled within the framework of rock-paper-
scissor game, is studied in presence of natural death and an effect of the environment. The
environmental impact is parameterized along with the death rates in the rate equation of the
species densities. Monte-Carlo simulations on this system reveal that the population density bears
the signature of first-order and second-order phase transitions in different regimes of the parameters
representing natural deaths of the species. The connection of this phenomena with the phase
transitions is also supported by the behavior of the basin entropy calculated for the system. The
density of total population evidently becomes an order parameter with respect to the change in
environmental impact on the system.

I. INTRODUCTION
A balanced ecosystem consists of a number of species ex-
isting simultaneously. However, within such an ecosys-
tem each of the constituent species has to fight against
numerous adversities to avoid extinction [1–3]. The ad-
versities that may put the existence of the species at risk,
can have different mode of operations. Sometimes one or
a few species within the system become vulnerable to-
wards such effect. For example, outbreak of an infectious
disease suddenly increases the death rate of some species.
On the other hand the adversities can have global impact
on the entire ecosystem. Any kind of harmful environ-
mental effect can be thought of as such an agent. Cli-
mate change, global warming, environmental pollution
are some of them that imparts direct and indirect effects
on the species [1, 4, 5]. For example, the risk of species
extinction increases with the increment of warming of the
environment. Increasing pollution also affects the lifes-
pan of each species in the ecosystem. The role of these
adverse parameters in the maintenance of biodiversity is
evidently an important theme of study.
The game theoretic approach towards the issue of pre-
serving biodiversity opens an avenue for mathematical
study in this regard [6–9]. To study an ecosystem accom-
modating diverse populations, cyclically interacting mod-
els particularly seem to be quite useful as they demon-
strate coexistence effectively [10–19]. Mapping such
model onto a lattice further opens up the possibility of
carrying out stochastic simulation [20]. The simplest
form of this model is the rock-paper-scissor (RPS) model
which contains three species having cyclic inter-species
predation and prey [21, 22]. The RPS model has been
studied, both analytically and numerically, from different
perspectives to understand various effects acting on and
emerging from an ecosystem. In general the state of co-
∗sirs.bh@gmail.comexistence are maintained by a set of parameters. These
parameters control the increase or decrease of the popula-
tion [23]. Combined effect of these parameters according
to their strengths gives rise to coexistence. Various inves-
tigations have been done within and beyond RPS frame-
work to understand coexistence from different outlooks
like the impact of mobility [22], spatial patterns formed
during coexistence [24–27], the effect of mutation [28–30]
etc. From a mathematical point of view, the models can
be described by non-linear coupled rate equations which
are mean-field approximations to the stochastic system.
The interactions like predation, reproduction, different
types of death etc. act as rate constants. The exact
solution of these rate equations are unfeasible most of
the time unless the system is excessively simple which
is again unrealistic. However the stability of the system
with respect to the rate constants or the properties of
the population fluctuations can be studied by statistical
mechanical treatment [31].
Out of different parameters (implemented as rate con-
stants in the rate equations) the rate of death of a species
has been found to play an important role in preserv-
ing coexistence [32–36]. The impacts of conditional [37]
and natural deaths [38, 39] have been studied in spatial
and non-spatial models. Even in presence of other inter-
species and intra-species interactions like predation and
reproduction, the natural death rate has been shown to
be the majorly contributing factor in bringing an ecosys-
tem to coexistence or single-species existence [38]. In ad-
dition to the internal effects, an ecosystem faces external
impacts as well.
Another important aspect of this system which has
been recently revealed through interdisciplinary study
is its connection with the topological phases of matter
[40–43]. In the field of statistical and condensed matter
physics, the topological phase transition has a pivotal
role in understanding the phases of matters that lack in
local symmetry and cannot be explained by Landau the-
ory. Surprisingly, rock-paper-scissor model sometimes
carry signatures of topological phase transitions underarXiv:2305.11954v2  [cond-mat.stat-mech]  27 Feb 20242
certain influences. One of the earliest studies on this
matter finds such a transition by defining vortices as the
points where three species meet [40]. In another study,
the RPS models driven by certain parameters show be-
havioral changes which are characteristically similar to
topological phase transitions [41].
Apart from the topological phase transition, ecosys-
tems mimic the phase transitions classified by Ehrenfest
[44] as well. These types of phase transitions are ex-
plainable in the Landau framework. The general concept
of these phase transitions is manifested in diverse fields
including biological systems [45, 46], biological networks
[47] or the formation of flocks and patterns [48] etc. Talk-
ing about phase transition in particular, the idea that
biological systems may possess a criticality is quite well-
established [49]. Experimental evidences are there in the
groups of human, mice and trees that correlations in-
creases under stress when the group leave the comfort
zone. After the stress crosses some critical value, the cor-
relations decrease and the group goes to crisis zone [50].
This scenario also depicts the phenomena of 2nd order
phase transition. Studies on active to absorbing phase
transitions have also been made on Lotka-Volterra sys-
tems [51]. Another interesting work reports phase tran-
sition originated through a transcritical bifurcation in
a metapopulation model under mean-field diffusive cou-
pling [52]. Phase transition is therefore a widely inves-
tigated phenomena in the field of population dynamics
[53]. Not only the equilibrium phase transitions, stud-
ies have been made to obtain dynamical phase diagram
also for RPS systems out of equilibrium in presence of
mobility [54].
Motivated by these interdisciplinary studies, our
present work searches for further evidences that may con-
nect the system’s behavior with stastical and condensed
matter phenomena. An ecosystem with cyclically pre-
dating species along with reproduction and natural death
rates is exposed to a global impact to which all the species
are equally vulnerable. The system is driven to coexis-
tence or single species survival or even null population
for different values of interaction parameters. As a re-
sult of changing the strength of this impact, the pop-
ulation of the system shows discontinuous and continu-
ous phase transitions depending on the internal setup of
inter-species interactions. However it may be noted that
change of the impact does not mean a varying environ-
ment. Rather, we consider a constant environment (in
space and time) but with multiple different impacts on
the species. We identify an order-parameter-like behav-
ior in the density of total population in these two types of
phase transitions. It is always interesting to observe the
phenomena of phase transitions beyond the field of sta-
tistical and condensed matter physics. Our work demon-
strates such phenomena in a simple 3-species RPS model
and also draws a phase diagram having tricritical point.
The remaining part of the paper is divided in three
more sections. Section II describes the model and the
method of numerical simulation. The related rate equa-tions and the corresponding stabilities have also been dis-
cussed here. Section III demonstrates the results which
are categorized as that of the discontinuous and the con-
tinuous phase transitions. Finally in section IV we con-
clude with the discussion and the viewpoint on the ob-
tained results.
II. THE MODEL AND THE RATE EQUATIONS
We construct a 2-dimensional lattice consisting of three
species interacting in a cyclic pattern through nearest
neighbour interaction. It mimics the RPS model for evo-
lutionary dynamics. In addition, the elements of the
species may increase their numbers by reproduction. The
death parameter tends to decrease the population on the
other hand. Here the act of death (due to aging or due
to accident) is not actually an interaction in the sense
that it does not depend on the presence or absence of
any other member of the system. As the death rate cre-
ates a vacant site, we follow the May-Leonard formula-
tion [13] where vacant sites are also there in addition
to three species and the total number of individuals is
not conserved. The predation strategy creates a vacant
site in the adjacent neighbor whereas the reproduction
fills a vacant site with an individual [55]. Let us assume
that the densities of species A,BandCareρa,ρband
ρcrespectively. These three densities, along with the
density of vacant sites ( ρv), follow the conservation rule:
ρa+ρb+ρc+ρv= 1. We can write the cyclic predation
strategy in the following way
{A, B, C }+{B, C, A }rate p{a,b,c }− − − − − − − − → { A, B, C }+V(1)
where V denotes a vacant site. The reproduction equa-
tions may be written as
{A, B, C }+Vrate r{a,b,c }− − − − − − − − → 2{A, B, C } (2)
In addition to these two interactions, we take into ac-
count the effect of the environment on the existence of
the species. In our model we assume that the external
impact due to the environment is homogeneous and acts
on all the three constituent species by increasing or de-
creasing their death rates. This may be represented as
{A, B, C }rate ε·d{a,b,c }− − − − − − − − − → V (3)
where da,b,care the death rates of the three species and
the parameter εinfluences all the death rates in similar
manner.
We plan to study the stochastic dynamics primarily
by Monte-Carlo simulation on the above model in a 2-
dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions
applied. Our previous works [38, 39] report the signifi-
cance of the death rates in the maintenance of coexistence
and emergence of the spiral patterns in spatial distribu-
tions. As discussed earlier, an individual has to struggle3
with the environment in addition to confronting other
species. We focus on those effects of environment that
endanger the existence of life in an ecosystem. There-
fore, in this present work we mimic this effect by the
parameter ε, which controls the natural death of all the
constituent species and investigate the dynamics of the
population.
The Monte-Carlo simulation is based on the interac-
tion with any one of four individuals in the von Neumann
neighborhood at one Monte-Carlo step. The simulation
starts from a randomly constructed initial configuration
of three species. At each Monte-Carlo step, we first select
a primary non-empty site randomly and then one of its
four nearest neighbors. For a non-empty nearest neigh-
bor, predation-prey is performed with probabilities, pa,b,c
as the case may be. On the other hand, reproductions
take place with probabilities ra,b,cif the chosen nearest
neighbor site is empty. A typical case of predation is
shown schematically in figure 1. Along with the preda-
tion and reproduction, the individual residing in the pri-
mary site abolish with a probability ε·da,b,cmaking the
corresponding site vacant. Technically at each Monte-
Carlo step, we randomly select a non-empty site as a pri-
mary site and also select one site out of its four nearest
neighbors randomly. Then one of the three actions i.e,
death, predation and reproduction is performed at a step
with corresponding probabilities assigned. As a result,
the species in the primary site may abolish with proba-
bility da,b,c, or predation-prey may occur for non-empty
nearest-neighbor site with probability pa,b,c, or the indi-
vidual in the primary site may attempt reproduction with
probability ra,b,cin case the nearest neighbor is found to
be empty. After each Monte-Carlo step, the chosen site
and the chosen nearest neighbor are updated accordingly.
The results obtained here are averaged over 10 different
initial configurations. The time unit of our calculation is
defined by NMonte-Carlo steps, where Nis the system
size (i.e. the lattice size which is also equal to the sum of
the numbers of three species and vacancy, because each
site can be occupied by one individual only or remain
vacant).
The temporal evolution of the densities of the three
species can also be obtained from the rate equations de-
rived after mean-field approximation. We can construct
them in the form of coupled non-linear differential equa-
tions involving predation, reproduction, death and envi-
ronmental impact as rate constants. These differential
equations looks like
∂ρa
∂t=ρa(t) [raρv(t)−pcρc(t)−ε·da]
∂ρb
∂t=ρb(t) [rbρv(t)−paρa(t)−ε·db]
∂ρc
∂t=ρc(t) [rcρv(t)−pbρb(t)−ε·dc] (4)
where ρa(t),ρb(t),ρc(t) and ρv(t) are the densities of
species A,B,Cand vacancy respectively at time tand
ρv(t) = 1 −ρa(t)−ρb(t)−ρc(t). We get three sets offixed points for equation (4). The following sets of fixed
points are obtained for the above rate equations [38]
I. Trivial fixed point: ρa=ρb=ρc= 0.
II. Single species fixed points:
(a)ρa= 1−ε·da
ra,ρb=ρc= 0.
(b)ρb= 1−ε·db
rb,ρa=ρc= 0.

The system moves to a feasible fixed point depending on
the values of the parameters. The dynamics obtained
from the Monte-Carlo simulation also equilibrates to the
same densities here.
III. RESULTS
The model ecosystem evolving with assigned predation,
reproduction and death rates with environmental im-
pact shows different temporal behaviors of the species
densities in different regimes of the values of parame-
ters. We denote the density of the entire population as
ρ=ρa+ρb+ρcand observe its behavior in different
situations. The reason behind such observation will be
more clear subsequently when the phase transitions will
be indicated by this quantity with respect to the external
impact ε. We mainly focus in two different regimes de-
pending on the death rates of the species, keeping the pre-
dation rates and reproduction rates same for all the three
species, i.e., pa=pb=pc= 0.2 and ra=rb=rc= 0.4
throughout the entire work. We keep the system size
N= 100 ×100 in all the results shown here. However,
keeping in mind the impact of finite-size effects on dy-
namic phase transitions [56] we checked that in our case,
further increase of system size only reduces the small fluc-
tuations in the density profile and does not affect the key
observations.

FIG. 1. Schematic representation of the lattice and one arbitrary Monte-Carlo step: Species A,B,Cand vacant sites are
distributed in the 2-D lattice. Then one site is chosen randomly (marked in red color). The four nearest neighbors of the
chosen site are marked in blue color. Out of these four, one is chosen for interaction (encircled by yellow dashed line). Then
the interaction takes place with corresponding probability. In this figure, Apredates its chosen nearest neighbor B.
behind taking such values lies in the fact that this criteria
enforces the survival of single species Ain absence of
the environmental effect [38]. However, in the present
observation, we find that even after this criteria being
fulfilled, the system shows coexistence for small values of
ε.
Figure 2 shows the temporal behaviors of the densities
of each species for different values of εkeeping da= 0.02
anddb=dc= 0.1. In this case, for ε <1, we get coexis-
tence in the long-time behavior of the density. However,
the existence of single species Aprevails for ε≥1. So
the system changes its position from coexistence to single
species survival at a transition point εt= 1. This value
ofεtwhere the system changes its state is obviously de-
pendent on other parameters (see figure 3).
Now if we plot the total density, ρevaluated long time
after the equilibration against the parameter ε, we obtain
what is shown in figure 3(a). The total density shows an
abrupt change at εt= 1. In figure 3(b), we plot the
same for a different set of death values and show that
the abrupt change in the density occurs at a different
value of εt.
This transition occurs because it is observed in Monte-
Carlo simulations that the system equilibrates towards
a coexistent state although it is an unstable fixed point
in view of the stability analysis [38]. For ε < ε tthe
system possesses two valid sets of fixed points (i.e. pos-
sible sets of fixed points available to the system for the
given parameter values): type II and type III. Here the
system equilibrates to the type III fixed point which is
the coexistent state. The fixed point densities decays
with increasing εand at one stage ( ε≥εt) at least one
(or more) of them becomes zero. This situation pushes
the system towards the type II fixed point giving single
species survival state. The switch over from one fixed
point to another is captured by the abrupt change in to-
tal population density.
It has been observed that for further increase of εde-
creases the total density which is obvious. Therefore the
system ultimately goes to the void state (having zero
population). The transition from the single species sur-
vival state to the void state shows a continuous changein the total density. We have elaborated this part in
section III D.
B. Transition from coexistence to void state
In this case, along with the previous predation and re-
production rates, we set the three death values equal as
well. It ensures the coexistence of the three species ini-
tially for ε= 1 [38]. Here, instead of jumping to a single
species survival state the system always remains in coex-
istence. However the total density decays with increasing
ε. figure 4 shows the time variation of the densities of
the three species for different values of ε. It is evident
that the total population decreases with increasing ε.
In figure 5 we plot the sum of the final densities for
each εand find that after a certain value of εc, the total
density becomes zero indicating a null state. This critical
value (beyond which the population vanishes) depends on
the values of other parameters. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) are
for different sets of such values. The variation of ρwith ε
resembles the curve for an order parameter in 2nd order
(continuous) phase transition [44].
Here the system, residing in the coexistent state for
ε < ε c, gradually sheds off the fixed point densities with
increasing ε. All these densities become zero for ε≥εc
denoting the null state which is again the trivial fixed
point of type I.
The behavior of the population density of the model
ecosystem resembles both the 1st order and 2nd order
phase transitions in two different situations. In the field
of thermodynamics and statistical physics, Ehrenfest’s
classification of the phase transitions was based on the
behavior of the thermodynamic free energy [44]. Ac-
cording to this the phase transitions were categorized by
the lowest discontinuous derivative of the free energy at
the transition point. 1st order phase transitions exhibit
a discontinuity in the first derivative of the free energy,
one of which is the entropy of the system. In case of the
freezing of water, entropy changes discontinuously at the
transition point. On the other hand, second-order phase
transitions show continuous change in entropy across5

the critical point. However, the specific heat i.e. the
second derivative of free energy has discontinuity at that
point. In all these cases a measurable quantity is marked
as order parameter which differentiates two phases by
its value. The density difference in case of freezing of
water or the magnetization in case of magnetic material
are the order parameters of respective transitions. In
similar manner the population density in our present
work may be designated as the order parameter of both
the transitions of state.
C. Basin Entropy
The notion that the jump from coexistence to single
species in case of first-order transition and from coex-
istence to void state in case of second-order transition
can somehow be captured by the symmetry of the distri-
bution of species motivates to connect it with the change
of basin entropy. To look into the similarity explicitly, let
us calculate the basin entropy of our model ecosystem.
Following previous works [57, 58], we can calculate the
basin entropy in case of our model ecosystem. For this
we divide the entire system into Lnumber of blocks andcalculate the entropy in each block by
Sl=−4X
i=1pilogpi (5)
Here the sum runs over the three species and the vacancy
andpiis the probability of occupation of each species or
vacancy within one block. The basin entropy is obtained
by the average entropy for all blocks within the system,
i.e.
S=1
LLX
l=1Sl (6)
Although in principle the basin entropy should be de-
pendent on the size of the blocks, there is no qualitative
difference among them. Therefore we show the entropy
obtained by dividing the systems into 25 ×25 blocks.
The results are shown in both cases (sections III A and
III B) in figures 3(c),(d) and figures 5(c),(d) respectively.
In this system, the entropy is maximum when all
the species including vacancy has equal occupation
probability. On the other hand the entropy becomes
zero when all the sites are occupied by one species (or
vacancy) only. In terms of symmetry, the former state
is less symmetric than the later one. In figures 3(c) and6

may note that the entropy does not become zero as
in the single species state there are vacant sites also.
However, in figures 5(c) and (d) the entropy shows
continuous transition towards zero at ε=εc. That the
change is continuous can be more clearly understood7

from figures A2(c) and (d) in Appendix A. The above
behavior of entropy, as defined in this system, bears its
direct connection with the phenomena of 1st and 2nd
order phase transitions.
D. Phase diagram
We further explore the phase diagram for the system
in the ε−daplane. For this we keep dbanddcfixed.
We observe that, if we increase dabeyond the point
da=db=dc, where only the continuous transitions
occur, the system transits from coexistence to survival
of single species Band then to the void state with in-
creasing ε. The first transition is discontinuous and the
second transition is continuous.
Therefore when da< db=dc, the system moves from
coexistence to existence of single species Avia first-order
transition and then from single species Ato void state
via second-order phase transition with increasing ε.
Similar phenomena occurs for da> db=dcwith only
the phase of single species Abeing replaced by that of
B. Right at the point da=db=dc, the system has only
second-order phase transition from coexistence to void
state. The complete picture can be perceptible from the
3D plot in figure 6(a) showing variation of ρwith εand
dafor a fixed value of dbanddc(da=db= 0.1). Herethe discontinuous jumps in ρindicate the first-order
transitions and the second-order transitions are marked
byρbecoming zero. A phase diagram on the da−ε
plane corresponding to the 3D plot is also drawn in

da=db=dc(= 0.1 here) is a tricritical point where
the first-order and the second-order lines meet having
coexistence of three phases (coexistence, single species
survival and void state).
IV. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
The aim of our present study was to explore the role of
a global impact that affects all constituent species in an
ecosystem in a similar way. We therefore assigned a sin-
gle parameter which can control all the death rates in a
three-species ecosystem modeled by cyclically dominat-
ing rock-paper-scissor interaction. Considering the total
population density as the main observable, we find this
quantity showing two different types of phase transitions
(first-order and second-order) with the change of the con-
trolling parameter in two different regimes of death rates.
The first-order phase transition drives the system from
coexistence to single species survival state beyond a tran-8

The second-order transitions occur when the densities become zero. The red colored line for da= 0.1 has only second-order
transition at ε= 2.0. (b) Phase diagram of the system in the plane of daandεfordb=dc= 0.1. The line in red color shows
the first-order transition and the blue colored line shows the second-order transition. The two lines touch at the tricritical point

on 50×50 lattices and it has been further checked that the results do not change for higher system sizes.
sition point whereas the system goes to a zero-population
state beyond a critical value through the second-order
phase transition. Based on these observations, the envi-
ronmental hazards appears to have twofold impact on the
ecosystem: Besides diminishing densities of the species
the coexistence may be suddenly jeopardized or the en-
tire population may be abolished gradually.
Although the deterministic equations sometimes yield
more than one set of viable fixed point for a particular
parameter set, it is the stochasticity of the system
that ultimately decides which fixed point to go for.
Thus the stochasticity also plays the main role in the
transition from one fixed point to another, similar to the
role of fluctuation in triggering phase transition. It is
also intriguing to find an underlying similarity between
two apparently different mechanisms: population in an
ecosystem and phase transition in a thermodynamic
system. Symmetry within the distribution of the species
plays the connecting role through the entropy in both the
systems. It is percievable that when the system transits
from a coexistent state to single species state the change
is abrupt because of two of the species being completely
eradicated and the remaining one having considerable
density. On the other hand, when the system transits
directly to a void state from coexistence, densities of
all the species decrease gradually to zero. This change
seems to be continuous therefore. The quantity that
can somehow relate to both these phenomena must have
some connection with how all the species are distributed
within the system. That is why the basin entropy which
involves the occupation probabilities of the species,
shows behavioral similarity in these circumstances. In
case of an ecosystem the occupation probabilities of allthe species being comparable enhances the entropy and
hence affects the symmetry of the system. It is enhanced
once the system faces dominance of one species or the
vacancy. Therefore, in an ecosystem also, we can think
of one kind of symmetry breaking to culminate in the
phase transition. Thus the understanding of collective
behavior in matter at thermal equilibrium, especially
the concept of phase transition, surprisingly provides
our cognition on some behavioral changes observed in
Earth’s ecosystem as well. The study made so far also
provides room for further investigation in future on
the behavior of species correlations in different phases.
Search for any kind of universality class can also be
made for further characterization of the system.
APPENDIX A
We further investigate for more precise location of the
critical points εtandεcby giving smaller increment of ε
(δε= 0.01) around the critical points. Due to the heavy
numerical cost the areas close to the critical points have
been probed. The results - ρvsεgraphs, basin entropy
vsε, both for first-order and second-order phase transi-
tions are shown in figure A1 and figure A2 respectively.
The sharp changes both in density and basin entropy are
clearly visible in case of the first-order transition whereas
the second-order transition shows continuous changes in
these two quantities.9
