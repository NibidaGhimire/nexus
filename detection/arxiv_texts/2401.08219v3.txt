Abstract. Extensions of Stone-type dualities have a long history in algebraic logic and
have also been instrumental for proving results in algebraic language theory. We show
how to extend abstract categorical dualities via monoidal adjunctions, subsuming various
incarnations of classical extended Stone and Priestley duality as special cases. Guided
by these categorical foundations, we investigate residuation algebras, which are algebraic
models of language derivatives, and show the subcategory of derivation algebras to be
dually equivalent to the category of profinite ordered monoids, restricting to a duality
between boolean residuation algebras and profinite monoids. We further refine this duality
to capture relational morphisms of profinite ordered monoids, which dualize to natural
morphisms of residuation algebras. As a special case of the discrete version of the duality
between monoids and complete residuation algebras, we obtain a novel concrete description
for the dual of the category of all small categories and functors.
1.Introduction
Marshall H. Stone’s representation theorem for boolean algebras [ Sto36], the foundation for
the so called Stone duality between boolean algebras and Stone spaces, manifests a tight
connection between logic and topology. It has thus become an ubiquitous tool in various
areas of theoretical computer science, not only in logic, but also, for example, in domain
theory and automata theory.
From algebraic logic arose the need for extending Stone duality to capture boolean alge-
bras equipped with additional operators (modelling quantifiers or modalities). Originating in
Jónsson and Tarski’s representation theorem for boolean algebras with operators [ JT51,JT52],
a representation in the spirit of Stone was proven by Halmos [ Hal58]; the general categorical
picture of the duality of Kripke frames and modal algebras is based on an adjunction between
operators and continuous relations developed by Sambin and Vaccaro [SV88].
In the context of automata theory, the need for extensions of Stone duality was only un-
veiled in this millenium: while Pippenger [ Pip97] has already shown that the boolean algebra
of regular languages on an alphabet Σcorresponds, under Stone duality, to the Stone space cΣ∗
of profinite words, Gehrke et al. [ GGP08] discovered that, under Goldblatt’s form of extended
Priestley duality [ Gol89], theresiduals of language concatenation dualize to multiplication
on the space of profinite words. But while categorical frameworks have identified Stone-type
dualities to be one of the cornerstones of algebraic language theory [ UACM17 ,Sal17], the
correspondence between residuals and multiplication via extended duality has not yet been

placed in the categorical big picture. One reason is that, despite some progress in recent
years [BKR07,HN15], extended (Stone) dualities for (co-)algebras are themselves not fully
understood as instances of a crisp categorical idea.
In the present paper, we introduce a simple categorical framework for extending any
categorical duality C≃opbCviamonoidal adjunctions . More specifically, for a given
adjunction on Cwith a strong monoidal right adjoint U, we establish a dual equivalence
between the category of U-operators on Cand the category of operators in the Kleisli category
of the monad on bCarising from the dual of the given adjunction. We then demonstrate how
to instantiate this abstract extended duality to Priestley duality, which not only recovers
Goldblatt’s original duality for distributive lattices with operators [ Gol89] but also applies
more generally to bialgebraic operators with relational morphisms.
Guided by our categorical foundations for extended Stone duality, we subsequently
investigate the correspondence between language derivatives and multiplication of profinite
words in the setting of residuation algebras originally studied by Gehrke [ Geh16b]. The
key observation is that on finite distributive lattices, the residuals are equivalent to a
coalgebraic operator on the lattice, and we show how to lift this correspondence to locally
finite structures, i.e. structures built up from finite substructures. By identifying suitable
non-full subcategories – derivation algebras and locally finite comonoids, respectively –
and an appropriate definition of morphism for residuation algebras, we augment Gehrke’s
characterization of Stone-topological algebras in terms of residuation algebras to a duality
between the categories of derivation algebras and that of profinite ordered monoids:
Der∼=Comon lf≃opProfOrdMon . (1.1)
The above duality clarifies the relation between Gehrke’s results and the duality by Rhodes
and Steinberg [RS09] between profinite monoids and counital boolean bialgebras.
The abstract theory of extended duality now suggests that the dual equivalence between
profinite ordered monoids on the one side and locally finite comonoids as well as derivation
algebras on the other side extends to a more general duality capturing morphisms of relational
type of profinite ordered monoids. To this end, we identify a natural notion of relational
morphism for residuation algebras and comonoids, and we use our abstract extended duality
theorem to obtain the dual equivalence
RelDer ∼=RelComon lf≃opRelProfOrdMon
which extends (1.1)to relational morphisms. To our knowledge, this is the first duality result
for relational morphisms of profinite monoids, which have become an ubiquitous tool in
algebraic language theory [Pin88] and semigroup theory [RS09].
Finally, we combine the ideas underlying these results to derive a novel duality between
the category of all small categories and the category of categorical residuation algebras :
Cat≃opCatResCABA . (1.2)
To obtain it, we instantiate the abstract extended duality to the discrete duality between sets
and complete atomic boolean algebras (CABAs) and combine it with two observations: first,
small categories are equivalent to certain relational monoids ; second, the discrete version of
the duality (1.1)admits an extension to a duality between relational monoids and residuation
CABAs. We then prove that the composite of these equivalences restricts to (1.2).EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 3
Related Work. The present paper is a completely revised and extended version of our
conference paper [ BMU24] presented at FoSSaCS 2024. Besides providing detailed proofs
of all results, we have included additional material: Proposition 3.13 simplifies dualiziation
of composite operators, and it is used in Section 4.3 to show how to derive results from
modal correspondence theory in a categorical way, by encoding modal formulas as morphisms.
We added Proposition 5.38 to complete the picture relating profinite ordered monoids and
Priestley monoids similarly to the unordered case. Finally, the dual characterization of the
category Catof small categories (Section 6) is a new application of our abstract methods.
Duality for (complete) boolean algebras with operators goes back to Jónsson and
Tarski [JT51,JT52]. This duality was refined by the topological approach via Stone spaces
taken by Halmos [ Hal58], which allowed to characterize the relations arising as the duals of
operators, namely boolean relations . Halmos’ duality was extended to distributive lattices with
(n-ary) operators by Goldblatt [ Gol89] and Cignoli [ CLP91]. Kupke et al. [ KKV04] recognized
that boolean relations elegantly describe descriptive frames as coalgebras for the (underlying
functor of) the Vietoris monad on the category of Stone spaces; notions of bisimulation for
these coalgebras were investigated by Bezhanishvili et al. [ BFV10]. Bonsangue et al. [ BKR07]
introduced a framework for dualities over distributive lattices equipped with a theory of
operators for a signature, which are dual to certain coalgebras. Hofmann and Nora [ HN15]
have taken a categorical approach to extend natural dualities to algebras for a signature
equipped with unaryoperators preserving only some of the operations prescribed by the
signature; they relate these to coalgebras for (the underlying functor of) a suitable monad T.
In their framework, Tis a parameter required to satisfy certain conditions for the duality to
work, while in our work Tis determined by the adjunction. The recent work by Bezhanishvili
et al. [BHM23] clarifies the relation between free constructions on distributive lattices and
the different versions of the Vietoris monad to derive several dualities between distributive
lattices with different types of operators and their corresponding Priestley relations.
Residuated boolean algebras, i.e. boolean algebras with a residuated binary operator,
were explicitly considered by Jónsson and Tsinakis [ JT93] to highlight the role of the residuals
in relation algebra. Gehrke et al. [ GGP08] exposed the connection between the residuals
of the concatenation of regular languages and the multiplication on profinite words and
investigated applications to automata theory, most notably a duality-theoretic proof of
Eilenberg’s variety theorem [ Eil76]. The duality theory behind the correspondence of general
residuation algebras and Priestley-topological algebras was developed by Gehrke [ Geh16b]
via canonical extensions [ Geh09,GP07] and Goldblatt’s extended Stone duality [ Gol89].
Gehrke [Geh16b] also provides conditions under which the dual relations of the residuals is
functional; Fussner and Palmigiano [ FP19] have shown that functionality of the dual relation
is not equationally definable in the language of residuation algebras.
2.Preliminaries
Readers are assumed to be familiar with basic category theory, such as functors, natural
transformations, adjunctions and monoidal categories, see Mac Lane [ ML98] for an introduc-
tion. We briefly recall the foundations of Stone duality [ Sto36] and Priestley duality [ Pri70].
By the latter we mean the dual equivalence DL≃opPriestbetween the category DL
of bounded distributive lattices and lattice homomorphisms, and the category Priestof
Priestley spaces (ordered compact topological spaces in which for every x̸≤ythere exists a
clopen upset containing xbut not y) and continuous monotone maps. The duality sends a4 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
distributive lattice Dto the pointwise-ordered space DL(D,2)of homomorphisms into the
two-element lattice (equivalently, prime filters, ordered by inclusion), and topologized via
pointwise convergence. In the reverse direction, it sends a Priestley space Xto the distribu-
tive lattice Priest (X,2)of continuous maps into the two-element poset 2 ={0≤1}with
discrete topology (equivalently, clopen upsets), with the pointwise lattice structure. Priestley
duality restricts to Stone duality BA≃opStonebetween the full subcategories BAof
boolean algebras and Stoneof Stone spaces (discretely ordered Priestley spaces). Moreover,
it restricts to Birkhoff duality [ Bir37]DLf≃opPos fbetween finite distributive lattices and
finite posets, sending a finite distributive lattice to its poset of join-irreducibles and a poset
to its lattice of upsets – note that the pointwise order on homomorphisms induces the reverse
order on join-irreducibles. For a comprehensive introduction to ordered structures and their
dualities, see the first two chapters of the classic textbook by Johnstone [Joh82].
3.Extending Dualities
We present our first contribution, a general categorical framework for extending Stone-type
dualities via monoidal adjunctions. It is motivated by the extension of Priestley duality to
operators due to Goldblatt [ Gol89] (which is recovered in Section 4) and serves as the basis
for several concrete duality results derived subsequently.
Notation 3.1. (1) Given functors U:C→DandF:D→C, we write
F:D⊣C:U
(or simply F⊣U) ifFis left adjoint to U. We denote the unit and counit by
η: Id→UFand ε:FU→Id; (3.1)
the transposing isomorphisms are denoted by
(−)+:D(C, UD )⇄C(FC, D ) :(−)−
Hence, for every f:C→UDandg:FC→Dwe have
f+=εD·Ff, and g−=Ug·ηC.
(2)For dually equivalent categories CandbCwe denote the equivalence functors in both
directions by
(b−):C≃− − →bCand (b−):bC≃− − →C.
Moreover, if F:C→Dis a functor and bDis dual to D, then we denote the dual of Fby
bF= (b−)·F·(b−):bC→bD.
(3)The Kleisli category of a monad (T, η, µ )on the category Cis denoted by CT. It has
the same objects as CandCT(X, Y) =C(X, TY ); the composition of Kleisli morphisms

A Kleisli morphism f:C→TDispureiff=ηD·f′for some f′:C→DinC.
We write JT:C→CTfor the usual functor mapping f:A→BtoηB·f:A→TB.
Convention 3.2. To lighten notation, we omit subscripts indicating components of natural
transformations when they are clear from the context, e.g. we write η:A→TAforηA.EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 5
Assumption 3.3. We fix monoidal categories C,Dwith dually equivalent categories bC,bD;
we regard bC,bDas monoidal categories with tensor products b⊗dual to the tensor products ⊗
ofC,D. Moreover, we fix an adjunction F:D⊣C:Uwith unit ηand counit ε(3.1), and
we assume that Uis astrong monoidal functor with associated natural isomorphisms
λ:UX⊗UY∼=U(X⊗Y)and ϵ:ID∼=UIC.
Remark 3.4. (1) The isomorphism λcan be extended to an isomorphism
λ:nO
i=1UXi∼=U(nO
i=1Xi)for all finite n,
which we denote by the same letter λ.
(2)The dual functor bU:bC→bDis a strong monoidal leftadjoint to bF, and the unit and
counit of the adjunction bU⊣bFare given by ˆεandˆη, respectively.
Notation 3.5. We denote the monad dual to the comonad FUbyT=bFbU.

T⊢bU(3.2)
The unit and multiplication of Tare given by
e= ˆε: Id→Tand m=bFˆηbU:TT→T.
Remark 3.6. (1) Since bUis strong monoidal w.r.t. the isomorphisms
ˆϵ:bID∼=bUbICand ˆλ:bUXb⊗bUY∼=bU(Xb⊗Y),
its right adjoint bFis (lax) monoidal (see e.g. [ SS02, p. 17]) w.r.t. the natural transformations
(ˆε−1)−:bIC→bFbIDand ((ˆηb⊗ˆη)·ˆλ−1)−:bFXb⊗bFY→bF(Xb⊗Y).
This makes bU⊣bFa monoidal adjunction, inducing a monoidal monad T=bFbUonbC. Let
ˆδ:TXb⊗TY→T(Xb⊗Y)
denote the witnessing natural transformation, which also extends to any arity, that is, for
every n-tuple of objects X1, . . . X n, we obtain a natural transformation
TX1b⊗···b⊗TXn→T(X1b⊗···b⊗Xn).
(2)The tensor product b⊗ofbClifts to the Kleisli category bCT; the lifting sends a pair
(f:X→TY, g :X′→TY′)ofbCT-morphisms to the bCT-morphism
ˆδ·(fb⊗g):Xb⊗X′→TYb⊗TY′→T(Yb⊗Y′).
This makes bCTitself a monoidal category [ Sea53, Prop. 1.2.2] with tensor b⊗and the canonical
left adjoint JT:bC→bCTa strict monoidal functor.

equivalent to the category of (n, k)-aryJT-operators:

Proof.The desired equivalence of categories is given by the functor
Φ: Opn,k
JT(bC)→Opk,n
U(C) (3.3)
which maps an (n, k)-aryJT-operator

and an operator morphism bf: (bA,ba)→(bB,bb)tof−:UB→UA.
Let us first verify that the definition of Φmakes sense on morphisms, i.e. that f−is an
operator morphism from (B, λ−1·b−·λ)to(A, λ−1·a−·λ). Unfolding the definitions of
composition and monoidal structure in the Kleisli category, we see that bfis a morphism

The multiplication mof the monad is the dual of FηU, so the dual diagram of (3.5)is the

powers, and note that the choice of the order in which we compose λ, λ−1and the associators
is irrelevant by the Coherence Theorem [ML98, Sect. VII.2] for monoidal categories.)

Since the counit ε=id+is the adjoint transpose of the identity and transposition is
natural, transposing the outer paths of the above diagram yield the inner square of the

By pre- and postcomposition of this square with λandλ−1, respectively, and replacing a−

simply becomes the square

We have shown that Φis indeed a functor, now we verify that it is an equivalence.
The (natural) isomorphisms
D(UA, UB )∼=C(FUA, B )∼=bC(bB,bFbUbA) =bC(bB, TbA)
given by the duality and the adjunction F⊣Uensure that this functor is fully faithful.
To see that it is essentially surjective, pick any U-operator c:(UC)⊗k→(UC)⊗n. We
have to show that it is isomorphic to an operator of the form (3.4). Since the original duality8 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS

Then Uh: (UC, c )→(UˆX, λ−1·a−·λ)is a pure operator isomorphism.
Remark 3.10. The definition of Φ(3.3)can be slightly generalized to yield a dual corre-
spondence between morphisms a:(UA)⊗k→(UB)⊗nofDand morphisms ρ:ˆBb⊗n→ˆTAb⊗k
ofbD: the dual of ais given by ρ=ch+, where h=λ·a·λ−1:UA⊗k→UB⊗n.
Our approach to extending dualities is compositional on two levels: first, compositionality
of adjunctions allows us to dualize certain operators more precisely; second, on the object
level, U-operators themselves admit a compositional structure under morphism composition
and tensor product, leading to simplercalculations of dual operators. We will use the first
and second version of compositionality in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, respectively.
We elaborate on the first point: Let Ebe a monoidal category with monoidal adjunctions
F1:E⊣C:U1and F2:D⊣E:U2
whichsplit F⊣U(i.e.F=F1F2,U=U2U1), and suppose that the monoidal structure of
Uis given by λ=U2λ1·λ2U1. The compositionality of adjunctions leads to the following
lifting property, applying to both operators and operator morphisms by setting A=Band
k=n= 1, respectively, in the following proposition. Here we say that, for a monoidal
functor G, a morphism f:(GX)⊗i→(GY)⊗jlifts along G, if there exists a morphism
g:X⊗i→Y⊗jwith f=λ−1·Gg·λ. The morphism gis called a liftingoff.
Proposition 3.11. Leta:(UA)⊗k→(UB)⊗nbe a morphism in Ddual to ρ:bBb⊗n→TbAb⊗k

(1)alifts along U2, that is,

(2)ρfactorizes through the monad morphism bF1ˆε2bU1:T1→T(where T1=bF1bU1), that is,
ρ=bF1ˆε2bU1·σfor some σ:bBb⊗n→T1bAb⊗k.
Proof.The dual of the morphism a:(U2U1A)⊗k→(U2U1B)⊗nunder the abstract extended

Now assume thatcg♯1:bBb⊗n→T1bAb⊗k=bF1bU1bAb⊗kis a morphism in bCsuch that we have a

using naturality of the isomorphisms ♭1, ♭2. The dual of the JT1-operatorcg♯1under the

This is equivalent to aadmitting the lifting b, that is, a=λ−1

Remark 3.12. (1)A special case of Proposition 3.11 proves that extended dualities preserve
purity: splitting F⊣UintoF1=Id⊣Id=U1andF2=F⊣U=U2, we see that a
U-operator (or operator morphism) ais pure iff its dual fis pure as a Kleisli morphism, that
is, it factorizes through the unit ˆεof the monad T.
(2)The right adjoint U2often is faithful and in this case ˆF1ˆε2ˆU1is monic, that is, T1is a
submonad of T: indeed, faithfulness of U2is equivalent to having an epic counit ε2, hence
ˆε2bU1is monic, and the right adjoint ˆF1preserves monos. In particular, if Tis ‘powerset-like’,
thenbCTis a category of relations, and we think of U-operators (or operator morphisms) of
the form a=λ−1
2·U2b·λ2as dualizing to ‘more functional’ relations. This idea is illustrated
by the examples in Section 4.2.
The compositionality on the level of U-operators manifests itself as follows:
Proposition 3.13. Leth, g:UA→UAbeU-operators with respective duals ρ, σ:bA→TbA.
On objects the abstract extended duality of Theorem 3.9 preserves
(1) Tensor products of operators:
h⊗g:UA⊗UA→UA⊗UAis dual to ˆδ·(ρb⊗σ):bAb⊗bA→TbAb⊗TbA→T(bAb⊗bA).
(2) Composition of operators:

(3) Identity operators:

Its outside commutes using the definition of the adjoint transpose α+, and the upper part also
commutes by adjoint transposition. The right-hand and lower parts commute by naturality
ofλandε, respectively. The middle part commutes trivially by the definition of δ. Thus,
the left-hand triangle commutes. This shows that, under the duality C≃opbC, the dual of
α+is equal to the dual of (h+⊗g+)·δ, which in turn is given by ˆδ·(ρb⊗σ).

As a first application of our adjoint framework, we investigate the classical Priestley duality
(Section 2) and derive a generalized version of Goldblatt’s duality [ Gol89] between distributive

Categories. The upper duality is Hofman-Mislove-Stralka duality [ HMS74] between the
category of join-semilattices with bottom and the category of Stone semilattices (i.e. topo-
logical join-semilattices with bottom whose underlying topological space is a Stone space)
and continuous semilattice homomorphisms. The duality maps a join-semilattice Jto the
Stone semilattice JSL(J,2)of semilattice homomorphisms into the two-element semilattice,
topologized by pointwise convergence. Equivalently, JSL(J,2)is the space Idl(J)ofideals
(downwards closed and upwards directed subsets) of J, ordered by reverse inclusion, with
topology generated by the subbasic open sets σ(j) ={I∈Idl(J)|j∈I}and their comple-
ments for j∈J. In the other direction, a Stone semilattice Xis mapped to its semilattice
StoneJSL (X,2)of clopen ideals, ordered by inclusion.EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 11
Functors. The functor U:DL→JSLis the obvious forgetful functor. Its left adjoint
F:JSL→DLmaps a join-semilattice Jto the set U∂
fg(J)of finitely generated upsets of J,
ordered by reverse inclusion. The dual right adjoint bFofFis the forgetful functor mapping
a Stone semilattice to its underlying Priestley space. Indeed, since F⊣U, we compute for
the carrier set |X|of a Stone semilattice Xthat
|bFX|=|dFbX|∼=|DL(FbX,2)|∼=|JSL(bX, U2)|=|JSL(bX,2)|∼=|X|,
and this bijection is a homeomorphism. The dual left adjoint and variants thereof are
computed in detail in recent work by Bezhanishvili et. al. [ BHM23]: The left adjoint
bU:Priest →StoneJSL maps a Priestley space Xto the Stone join-semilattice
dUbX=JSL(U(Priest (X,2)),2)∼=Idl(Cl ↑X)
of ideals of clopen upsets of X. This space is isomorphic to the (downset) Vietoris hyperspace
V↓XofXcarried by the set of closed downsets of X. The isomorphism is given by
Idl(Cl ↑X) ∼=V↓X
I 7→\
U∈IX\U
{U∈Cl↑X|C⊆X\U} ← [ C.
The topology of pointwise convergence on JSL(U(Priest (X,2)),2)translates to the hit-or-
miss topology onV↓Xgenerated by the subbasic open sets
{A⊆Xclosed |A∩U̸=∅}for U∈Cl↑X
and their complements. Note that for a Stone space X, the Stone join-semilattice V↓Xis
thefree Stone join-semilattice onX, as observed by Johnstone [ Joh82, Sec. 4.8]. The monad
induced by the adjunction is the (downset) Vietoris monad ; its unit e:X→V↓Xis given by
x7→ ↓xand multiplication is given by union [ HN15]. The monad V↓restricts to the Vietoris
monadVon the category Stoneof Stone spaces.
Remark 4.1 (Continuous Relations) .Continuous maps in Priestof the form
ρ:X→V↓Y
are known in the literature under a variety of names; we call them as Priestley relations as in
[CLP91,Gol89], orStone relations ifX, Yare Stone spaces. We write x ρ yfory∈ρ(x), and
sometimes identify ρwith a subset of X×Y. Let us note that some authors (e.g. [ RS09])
call a relation R⊆X×Ybetween topological spaces continuous if it is closed as a subspace
ofX×Y. Every Priestley relation is continuous. The converse generally fails: for instance,
consider any non-discrete Stone space Xand let C⊆Xbe a subset that is closed but not
open. The relation C×1⊆X×1is closed, but the corresponding map ρ:X→V1(given by
ρ(x) = 1ifx∈Candρ(x) =∅otherwise) is not continuous because ρ−1[1] = Cis not open.12 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
Monoidal Structure. The category JSLof join-semilattices has a tensor product ⊗that
represents join-bilinear maps, that is, maps J×J′→Kbetween join-semilattices preserving
joins and ⊥in each argument when the other argument is fixed:
Bilin( J×J′, K)∼=JSL(J⊗J′, K).
Join-bilinear maps J×J′→Kand their corresponding JSL-morphisms J⊗J′→Kare
often tacitly identified. The tensor product ⊗makes JSLa monoidal category with unit
2, i.e. 2⊗J∼=J. The standard presentation of J⊗J′as a join-semilattice is given by the
generators {j⊗j′|j∈J, j′∈J′}with equations
j1⊗0 = 0⊗j′
1= 0,(j1∨j2)⊗j′=j1⊗j′∨j2⊗j′and j⊗(j′
1∨j′
2) =j⊗j′
1∨j⊗j′
2
ranging over j1, j2∈Jandj′
1, j′
2∈J′. We call (the equivalence class of) a generating element
j⊗j′apure tensor . IfD, D′are bounded distributive lattices then so is UD⊗UD′[Fra76],
with meet given on pure tensors by (d⊗d′)∧(e⊗e′) = ( d∧e)⊗(d′∧e′). Moreover, the
lattice UD⊗UD′is the coproduct of D, D′inDL: the coproduct injections are given by
ι(d) =d⊗1′and ι′(d′) = 1⊗d′
ford∈D, d′∈D′, and the copairing of lattice homomorphisms f:D→E, f′:D′→Eis
given by the extension of the join-bilinear map
∧ ·(f×f′):D×D′→E, (d, d′)7→f(d)∧f(d′).
Taking coproducts yields a monoidal structure on DL, and since U(D+D′) =UD⊗UD′,
the functor Uis strong monoidal.
Lemma 4.2. The dual monoidal structure ˆδofV↓is given by product:
ˆδ:V↓X×V↓Y→V↓(X×Y), (C, D)7→C×D.
Proof.LetC∈V↓X, D∈V↓Ybe closed downsets. We first represent them by their respective
ideals IC, IDofCl↑X, which are equivalently JSL-morphisms
c:UCl↑X→U2, d:UCl↑X→U2.
The dual of the distributive law ˆδis
δ:DL(FUCl↑X+FUCl↑X,2)→DL(FU(Cl↑X+ Cl↑X),2)
mapping [c+, d+]to the transpose of
U[c+, d+]·(η⊗η):U(Cl↑X+ Cl↑X)
∼=U(Cl↑X)⊗U(Cl↑X)→UFU Cl↑X⊗UFU Cl↑X
∼=U(FUCl↑X+FUCl↑X)→U2.
The latter map sends a pure tensor A⊗B∈U(Cl↑X+Cl↑X)to its ‘product’ c(A)∧d(B).
Therefore the closed set ˆδ(C, D)corresponding to U[c+, d+]·(η⊗η)contains a pair (x, y)iff
x∈Candy∈D.
Spelling out Definition 3.8, the category Opn,k
JV↓(Priest )is given as follows:EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 13
Definition 4.3. A ((n, k)-ary)relational Priestley space consists of a carrier Priestley
space Xand a Priestley relation ρ:Xn→V↓Xk. Arelational morphism from a relational
Priestley space (X, ρ)to a relational Priestley space (X′, ρ′)is given by a Priestley relation
β:X→V↓Ysuch that, for all x∈Xn,y∈Xk, and y′∈X′k,
xρy∧(∀i:yiβ y′
i) =⇒ ∃x′: (∀i:xiβ x′
i)∧x′ρ′y′,
and, for all x∈Xn,x′∈X′n, and y′∈X′k,
(∀i:xiβ x′
i)∧x′ρ′y′=⇒ ∃y:xρy∧(∀i:yiβ y′
i).
We denote by Opn,k
JV↓(Priest )the category of (n, k)-ary relational Priestley spaces and
relational morphisms.
Then Theorem 3.9 instantiates to the following result:
Theorem 4.4 (Extended Priestley duality) .The category of (k, n)-ary U-operators of
distributive lattices is dually equivalent to the category of (n, k)-ary relational Priestley spaces
and relational morphisms:
Opk,n
U(DL)≃opOpn,k
JV↓(Priest ).
By taking n= 1and restricting the operator morphisms on both sides to be pure
(Remark 3.12(1)), we recover Goldblatt’s duality [ Gol89]. In the latter work, pure relational
morphisms are called bounded morphisms andn-aryU-algebras (UD)⊗n→UDinJSLare
called n-aryjoin-hemimorphisms .
Corollary 4.5 (Goldblatt duality) .The category of distributive lattices with n-ary join-
hemimorphisms, and pure morphisms between them, is dually equivalent to the category of
(1, n)-relational Priestley spaces and bounded morphisms.
4.1.Deriving Concrete Formulas. We proceed to show how an order-enriched extension
of our adjoint framework can be used to methodically derive concrete (i.e. element-based)
formulas for the dual join operator of a continuous relation and vice versa. Let us first
observe that all involved categories are order-enriched if we equip the homsets with the
usual pointwise order on functions. Moreover, from the definitions it is clear that the
transposing isomorphisms of the adjunction F⊣Uand the duality DL≃opPriestare
order-isomorphisms.
Second, we can represent an element ˆxof a Priestley space bXas a continuous function
ˆx∈Priest (1,bX); on the lattice side, elements jof a join-semilattice Jcorrespond bijectively
toJSL-morphisms j∈JSL(2, J), using that 2is the free semilattice on a single generator.
For the rest of this subsection let us fix a U-algebra hand its dual Priestley relation ρ:
h: (UX)⊗n→UXand ρ:bX→V↓bXn.
We first show how to express ρin terms of h. Viewing ρas a relation from bXtobXn
(Remark 4.1), two elements ˆx∈bX,ˆ x∈bXnare related by ρ(i.e.ˆx ρˆ x) iff the inequality14 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
e(ˆ x) =↓ˆ x≤ρ(ˆx)holds, equivalently, iff the left diagram below commutes laxly as indicated:

The duals of ˆx,ˆxiareDLmorphisms x, xi:X→2. Under duality and transposition
the left diagram corresponds to the right diagram where ∇is the codiagonal given by
n-fold conjunction, i.e. it sendsNn
i=1xitoVn
i=1xi. Writing Fz=z−1(1)for the prime
filter corresponding to a morphism z∈DL(X,2)the right diagram yields Goldblatt’s
formula [Gol89, p. 186] for the dual Priestley relation of an algebra h: we have
ˆx ρˆ xiff h[Y
iFxi]⊆Fx.
Conversely, toexpress hintermsof ρ, itsufficestodescribe h(x)forapuretensor x∈(UX)⊗n
by the universal property of the tensor product. We factorize
x=O
ixi· ∇−1:U2∼=(U2)⊗n→(UX)⊗n
to see that the element h(x)corresponds to the following morphism representing an element
of the join-semilattice UX:
h·O
ixi· ∇−1:U2∼=(U2)⊗n→(UX)⊗n→UX.
Its dual is the characteristic function

where Ci=cx+
iis the clopen upset of bXdual to
xi∈JSL(U2, UX)∼=DL(FU2, X)∼=Priest (bX,V↓1)∼=Priest (bX,2).
This shows that h(x)∈X∼=Cl↑bXcorresponds to the clopen upset
h(x) ={a∈bX| ∃(b1, . . . , b n)∈ρ(a):∀i:bi∈Ci=cx+
i} ∈Cl↑(bX),
so we derived Goldblatt’s formula [Gol89, p. 184] for the dual algebra of a relation ρ.
4.2.Functional Properties of Priestley Relations. As a further application of the
adjoint framework to extended Stone duality, we show how to recover the characterization of
those operators on distributive lattices whose dual Priestley relation is a partial function or
a total relation, respectively. As outlined in Remark 3.12, we achieve this by considering
suitable splittings of the adjunction F:JSL⊣DL:Uto obtain submonads of V↓on which
we instantiate Proposition 3.11.EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 15
Partial Functions. We split the adjunction F⊣Uinto
F1:DL0⊣DL:U1and F2:JSL⊣DL0:U2,
where DL0is the category of distributive lattices that are only bounded from below, and
U1, U2are forgetful functors. The tensor product of objects of DL0is given by the tensor
product of their underlying join-semilattices. The left adjoint F1adds a top element to a
lattice in DL0.
Lemma 4.6. The submonad T1onPriestdual to the adjunction F1⊣U1is given by the
partial function monad
T1X=X+{∅}.
Proof.The submonad T1=bF1bU1,→V↓onPriestis given by
bF1bU1bD∼=\F1U1D∼=DL(F1U1D,2)∼=DL0(U1D, U 12).
Every morphism f∈DL0(U1D, U 12)either satisfies f(⊤) =⊤, in which case f∈bDis prime;
orf(⊤) =⊥, but then fis the constant zero map ⊥!:U1D→U12. The map ⊥!is the
bottom element in the pointwise ordering of DL0(U1D, U 12), so the monad bF1bU1just freely
adjoins a bottom element to a Priestley space.
In particular, the dual category of DL0is readily seen to be equivalent to Priest 0,
the category of Priestley spaces with a bottom element, and bottom-preserving continuous
monotone maps. A Kleisli morphism ρ:X→T1X ,→V↓Xis apartial continuous function ,
and a U-operator lifts along U2iff it preserves non-empty meets. Proposition 3.11 thus
recovers the following result (for the unary version see [Hal58, HN15]).
Corollary 4.7. The dual Priestley relation of a U-operator is a partial function iff the
operator preserves non-empty meets.
Total Relations. We split the adjunction F⊣Uinto
F′
1:JSL 1⊣DL:U′
1and F′
2:JSL⊣JSL 1:U′
2,
where JSL 1is the category of join-semilattices with both a bottom and top element with
morphisms preserving joins, bottom, and top. The right adjoints U′
1, U′
2are forgetful functors,
and the tensor product of objects of JSL 1is given by the tensor product of their underlying
join-semilattices. The left adjoint F′
1maps J∈JSL 1to the distributive lattice U∂
fg+Jof
non-empty finitely generated upsets of J, ordered by reverse inclusion.
Lemma 4.8. The submonad T′
1onPriestdual to the adjunction F′
1⊣U′
1is given by the
non-empty Vietoris monad
T′
1X=V+
↓X.
Proof.We have
bF′
1bU′
1bD∼=DL(F′
1U′
1D,2)∼=JSL 1(U′
1D, U′
12).
The only ideal f∈JSL(UD, U 2)that is not an element of JSL 1(U′
1D, U′
12)is the trivial
ideal⊥!:d7−→ ⊥: iff(⊤)̸=⊤thenf(⊤) =⊥, sofsends all elements to ⊥by monotonicity..
The trivial ideal corresponds to the empty set ∅ ∈V↓bD. Thus T′
1X=V↓X\ {∅}.
Kleisli morphisms X→T′
1Ytherefore are simply totalPriestley relations. Moreover, a
U-operator lifts along U′
2iff it preserves the top element. Proposition 3.11 then yields the
following result (for the unary version see [Hal58, HN15]).16 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
Corollary 4.9. The dual Priestley relation of a U-operator is a total relation iff the operator
preserves the top element.
4.3.Equational Properties of Operators. In Section 4.2 we have shown how to use
factorizations of the adjunction F⊣Uto obtain more precise dualities for operators with
additional properties. However, spelling out and computing the factorizing adjunctions and
their dual monads for the desired operator property individually is tedious, and there often
is a simpler method: If an operator property can be described equationally , we can use the
fact that inequations of operators translate to inequations of their dual relations to obtain
additional information under dualization.
The results we recover in this section are usually associated with modal correspondence
theory, but we emphasize that our proofs do not require any first-order logic but are purely
algebraic in nature, using only manipulation of operator (in-)equations.
Proposition 4.10. Leth:UA→UAbe an operator on a boolean algebra Awith dual
Priestley relation ρ:bA→V↓bA. The following statements are equivalent:
(1)ρis reflexive iff ∀a∈A:a≤h(a).
(2)ρis symmetric iff ∀a, b∈A:a∧h(b)≤h(h(a)∧b).
(3)ρis euclidean iff ∀a, b∈A:h(a)∧h(b)≤h(a∧h(b)).
(4)ρis transitive iff ∀a, b∈A:h(a)∧h(b)≥h(a∧h(b)).
(5)ρis total iff h(⊤) =⊤.
(6)ρis empty iff ρiffh(⊤) =⊥.
The proof follows a simple pattern: (a) translate the inequation into a inequation between
operators, (b) dualize the inequation between operators to an inequation between Priestley
relations and (c) convert the relational inequality into the corresponding first-order property.
Proof.First we dualize some canonical operators whose combinations we can then du-
alize using Proposition 3.13. Recall from Proposition 3.13(3) that the identity oper-
ator idUA:UA→UAdualizes to the unit e:bA→V↓bA. The conjunction operator
∧:UA⊗UA→UAis equal to the conjugate
λ·U∇ ·λ−1:UA⊗UA∼=U(A+A)→UA∼=UA
and thus dualizes to the diagonal function ∆:bA→bA×bA.
Now let h:UA→UAbe a unary operator with dual Priestley relation ρ:bA→V↓bA.
(1)The condition ∀a∈A:a≤h(a)is equivalent to the operator inequality idUA≤h. The
dual inequality is given by e≤ρ:bA→V↓bA, that is, ∀x∈bA:{x} ⊆ρ(x), which states
precisely that ρis reflexive.
(2)The condition ∀a, b∈A:a∧h(b)≤h(h(a)∧b)is equivalent to ∧·(id⊗h)≤h·∧·(h⊗id).
The left side dualizes to
ˆδ·(e×ρ)·∆:bA→bA×bA→V↓bA×V↓bA→V↓(bA×bA)
which is given by x7→ {(x, y)|y∈ρ(x)}, while the right side dualizes to
m·ˆδ·V↓(ρ×e)·V↓∆·ρ:bA→V↓bA→V↓(bA×bA)→V↓(V↓bA×V↓bA)→V↓V↓(bA×bA)→V↓(bA×bA)EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 17
which is given by x7→ {(z, y)|y∈ρ(x), z∈ρ(y)}. On elements this inequality of relations
reads
∀x, y, z ∈bA:y∈ρ(x)⇒x∈ρ(y),
which states precisely that ρis symmetric.
(3), (4) The proof is analogous to part (2) and left as an exercise to the reader.
(5)Here we have to use two auxiliary operators that exist on every boolean algebra: the
‘bottom’ operator
z:UA→UA, x 7→ ⊥ whose dual is the empty relation ζ:bA→V↓bA, x 7→ ∅.
and the ‘top’ operator
t:UA→UA, x 7→(
⊥ifx=⊥
⊤otherwise,whose dual is τ:bA→V↓bA, x 7→bA.
The equation h(⊤) =⊤holds iff the equation h·t=t:UA→UAof operators holds. The
left side dualizes to
m·V↓τ·ρ:bA→V↓bA→V↓V↓bA→V↓bA, x 7→[
y∈ρ(x)τ(y) =(bAifρ(x)is non-empty ,
∅else.
The right side is simply τ:bA→V↓bA, x7→bA, and these relations are equal iff ρis total, that
is,ρ(x)is non-empty for every x.
(3)One has h(⊤) =⊥iff the operator equation h=zholds. Its dual equation ρ=ζsimply
states that ρ(x)is empty for every x.
Using Proposition 4.10 we recover a further result from the literature: Halmos [ Hal58]
calls an operator h:UA→UAaquantifier if it satisfies the (in)equations
h(⊤) =⊤, x ≤h(x)and h(x)∧h(y)≤h(x∧h(y)).
Corollary 4.11 (Halmos).An operator on a boolean algebra is a quantifier if and only if its
dual relation is an equivalence relation.
5.Profinite Ordered Monoids and Derivation Algebras
We shall now present the main application of our abstract extended duality (Theorem 3.9): we
derive a novel categorical duality between profinite ordered monoids andderivation algebras ,
a non-trivial restriction of Gehrke’s duality [ Geh16a,Geh16b] between Priestley-topological
algebras and residuation algebras. Our result emerges from a combination of two ingredients:
our framework for extended Priestley duality from the previous sections and an isomorphism
between residuation algebras and certain lattice coalgebras. The latter is first established for
finite algebras via an operator on complete lattices we call tensor implication ; extending it
to locally finite algebras (Definition 5.25) then yields the desired duality with the category
of profinite ordered monoids. To this end we introduce the notion of residuation morphism
(Definition 5.9). The abstract extended duality then allows us to extend our results to
relational morphisms of profinite ordered monoids and residuation algebras.18 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
5.1.The Tensor Product of Distributive Lattices Revisited.
Notation 5.1. In the following, by a latticewe mean a bounded distributive lattice, i.e.
an object of DL. We write deford∧e. The dual lattice of D, obtained by reversing the
order, is denoted D∂. The category of meet-semilattices with a top element is denoted MSL.
Analogous to JSL, it has a monoidal structure given by tensor product ⊠of meet-semilattices.
The category MSLis dual to the category of Stone meet-semilattices [ HMS74]. From now
on we denote the forgetful functors from DLtoJSLandMSLbyU∨andU∧, respectively,
to avoid ambiguity; however, if it is clear from context we tacitly may omit the forgetful
functors U∧andU∨for notational brevity and just write the join- and meet-semilattice tensor
products of the underlying semilattices of lattices D, D′asD⊗D′andD⊠D′, respectively.
Remark 5.2. The monad induced by the dual of F∧⊣U∧sends a Priestley space Xto
its hyperspace V↑Xof closed upsets[BHM23]. The respective comonads on DLof the
adjunctions F∧⊣U∧andF∨⊣U∨are not isomorphic but conjugate :F∧U∧∼=(F∨U∨(−)∂)∂.
Their restrictions to the category of boolean algebras are isomorphic since their dual monads
onStonesatisfyV↓=V=V↑. On the category of finite Priestley spaces (which are simply
posets), the monad V↓restricts to the downset monad, which further restricts to the finite
powerset monad on the category of finite Stone spaces (which are simply finite sets).
Remark 5.3 (Adjunctions on Lattices) .It is well known that a monotone map f:D→D′
between complete lattices preserves all joins if and only if it has a right adjoint f∗:D′→D,
which is then given by f∗(d′) =W
f(d)≤d′d; dually, it preserves all meets iff it has a left
adjoint f∗:D′→D, given by f∗(d′) =V
d′≤f(d)d. Since finite lattices are complete, every
monotone map fbetween finite lattices has a left and a right adjoint. The join-irreducibles
JDof a finite lattice Dare precisely those elements p∈Dwhose characteristic function
χp:D→2(mapping x∈Dto1iffp≤x) is a lattice morphism. The left adjoint of χp, also
denoted p: 2→D, is the join-semilattice morphism defined by 17→p.
Lemma 5.4. (1)The join- and meet-semilattice tensor products of distributive lattices D, E
yield isomorphic lattices, i.e. there exists an isomorphism
ω:U∨D⊗U∨E∼=− − → U∧D⊠U∧E.
(2)Adjunctions on lattices ‘compose horizontally’: Given adjunctions f:D⊣E:gand
f′:D′⊣E′:g′on lattices we get adjunctions:
E⊠E′D⊠D′
E⊗E′D⊗D′g⊠g′⊣

ω−1 ω ⊣

ω−1 ω

If the right adjoints gandg′preserve finite joins, then this simplifies to
f⊗f′⊣g⊗g′=ω−1(g⊠g′)ω.
Dually, ω(f⊗f′)ω−1=f⊠f′, iffandf′preserve finite meets.
Proof.(1)We have already seen that for lattices D, EtheirJSLtensor product U∨D⊗U∨E
is their coproduct in DL. By order-duality, the tensor product U∧D⊠U∧Ein the category
of meet-semilattices therefore gives a representation of the coproduct D+EinDL: itsEXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 19
inclusions ˆι1,ˆι2map d∈D, e∈Etoˆι1(d) =d⊠0andˆι2(e) = 0⊠e, respectively. By the
universal property of the coproduct we obtain a unique lattice isomorphism
ω:U∨D⊗U∨E→U∧D⊠U∧Esuch that ω·ιi= ˆιifori= 1,2.
We now show that ωis given by the following concrete formula:

By definition, the canonical isomorphism ωis the coparing ω= [ˆι1,ˆι2]of the inclusions of
the meet-semilattice tensor product. Therefore on pure tensors ωmaps d⊗e7→d⊠0∧0⊠e,
which extends to general elements of D⊗Evia distributivity as

(2)We only need to prove that one of the squares is an adjunction, since we obtain all others
by suitable composition with ωand its inverse. We show this for the third diagram, that is,
we show that there is an adjunction
(f⊗f′)·ω−1⊣(g⊠g′)·ω
by verifying the unit and counit inequalities

We only prove the counit inequality; the proof of the unit inequality is dual. Recall that
the right adjoint gpreserves meets. Given a finite index set Awe write xA=W

As for the last statement, if gandg′preserve finite joins, then g⊗g′is defined (otherwise

Proposition 5.5. LetDbe a finite distributive lattice.
(1)For every x∈Dthe join-semilattice homomorphism
x⊗(−):D→D⊗D, y 7→x⊗y,
has a right adjoint
x⊸(−):D⊗D→ D
T 7→_
x⊗y≤Ty
calledtensor implication . It can be extended to a binary function
(−)⊸(−):D∂⊠(D⊗D)→D.
Analogously, (−)⊗x:D→D⊗Dhas a right adjoint (−)⊸x:D⊗D→D.
(2)Ifp∈ JDis join-irreducible then p⊸(−)is a lattice homomorphism that can be
computed as
λ·(χp+ id): D+D→2 +D∼=D,_
i∈Ipi⊗qi7→_
p≤piqi.
(3)Every adjunction l⊣rbetween finite distributive lattices satisfies
x⊸ω−1(r⊠r)ω(T) =r(l(x)⊸T)
as well as
l(x⊸T)≤l(x)⊸(l⊗l)(T)and r(x⊸T)≤r(x)⊸ω−1(r⊠r)ω(T),
where the latter inequality holds with equality if ris order-reflecting.
Proof.(1)The function x⊗(−)preserves finite joins by definition, so its right adjoint
x⊸(−)exists and is given by T7→W
x⊗y≤Ty. We can write x⊗(−)as
x⊗(−) =λ−1·(x⊗id):D∼=2⊗D→D⊗D.EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 21
By Lemma 5.4(2), this has the right adjoint λ·ω−1·(χx⊠id)·ω. The extension to a binary
function (−)⊸(−):D∂⊠(D⊗D)→Dis an instance of an adjunction with a parameter
(cf. [ML98, Ch. IV.7]).
(2)Ifx=p∈ JDis join-irreducible, then χppreserves joins. Hence, p⊸(−)simplifies to
λ−1·(χp⊗id):D⊗D→2⊗D∼=2,_
ipi⊗qi7→_
p≤piqi,
which is a lattice morphism since λ−, χpandidare.
(3) Let T∈D⊗Dandx∈E. Then for all y∈Ewe have
y≤x⊸ω−1(r⊠r)ω(T)⇐⇒ x⊗y≤ω−1(r⊠r)ω(T)
⇐⇒ l(x)⊗l(y)≤T
⇐⇒ l(y)≤l(x)⊸T
⇐⇒ y≤r(l(x)⊸T).
So the first statement follows. Using this we compute
x⊸T≤x⊸ω−1(r⊠r)ω(l⊗l)(T) =r(l(x)⊸(l⊗l)(T)),
which by adjunction is equivalent to
l(x⊸T)≤l(x)⊸(l⊗l)(T).
Similarly,
r(x⊸T)≤r(l(r(x))⊸T) =r(x)⊸ω−1(r⊠r)ω(T),
and the first step is an equality if l·r=id, which is equivalent to rbeing order-reflecting.
5.2.ResiduationAlgebras. Weproceedwithrecallingthedefinitionofresiduationalgebras,
which are distributive lattices equipped with two additional operations to be thought of as
abstractions of language derivatives (Example 5.8.(4)).
Definition 5.6. (1)A(boolean) residuation algebra consists of a (boolean) lattice R∈DL
equipped with MSL-morphisms \:R∂⊠R→Rand/:R⊠R∂→R, theleftandright
residual, satisfying the residuation property :b≤a\c⇐⇒ a≤c / b.
(2) A residuation algebra Risassociative if it satisfies
x\(z / y) = (x\z)/ yfor all x, y, z ∈R,
and it is unitalif there exists a join-irreducible element e∈ JRwhich is a unit:
e\z=z=z / e.
Remark 5.7. Units are unique: If e, e′are units, then e=e′\esince e′is a unit, so by the
residuation property e′≤e / e =e. Analogously we have e≤e′, soe=e′.
As indicated above, residuals serve as algebraic generalizations of language derivatives,
but as the following examples indicate they are not limited to this interpretation.
Examples 5.8. (1)Every Heyting algebra is an associative residuation algebra with residu-
alsa\c=a→candc / b =b→c.
(2)Every boolean algebra Bis a non-associative residuation algebra with x\1 = 1and
x\z=¬xforz̸= 1. IfBis non-trivial, then it is not unital by the first equality.22 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS

A\C={x∈X| ∀a∈A:f(a, x)∈C},
C / B ={x∈X| ∀b∈B:f(x, b)∈C}.
(4)The set RegΣof all regular languages over a finite alphabet Σforms an associative
boolean residuation algebra with residuals given by left and right extended derivatives :
K\L={v∈Σ∗|Kv⊆L}, L / K ={v∈Σ∗|vK⊆L}.
The unit is the singleton {ε}, where εis the empty word. This example is a special case
of (3): take as (X, f)thefree profinite monoid onΣ, which is the Stone dual of Reg Σ.
We now introduce the notion of a residuation morphism between residuation algebras
and also its relational generalization.
Definition 5.9. (1)A lattice morphism f:R→Sbetween unital residuation algebras is a
(pure) residuation morphism if it satisfies the conditions
∀x, z∈R:f(x\z)≤f(x)\f(z)andf(z / x)≤f(z)/ f(x) (Forth)
∀(y, z)∈S×R:∃xy,z∈R:y≤f(xy,z)andy\f(z) =f(xy,z\z) (Back)
∀(y, z)∈S×R:∃xy,z∈R:y≤f(xy,z)andf(z)/ y=f(z / x y,z) (Back’)
∀x∈R:e≤x⇔e′≤f(x) (Unit)
where eande′are the units of RandS. The morphism fisopenif, additionally, it has a
left adjoint. Unital residuation algebras and residuation morphisms form a category Res.
(2)A(lax) relational residuation morphism from a unital residuation algebra Rto a unital
residuation algebra Sis a morphism ρ∈JSL 1(R, S)satisfying
ρ(x\z)≤ρ(x)\ρ(z)and e′≤ρ(e).
Unital residuation algebras with relational residuation morphisms form a category RelRes.
Notation 5.10. We use the convention that for a subcategory CofResorRelRes we
denote the full subcategory of Cwith boolean carriers by BC.
Remark 5.11. Let us provide some intuition behind Definition 5.9.
(1)The notion of residuation morphism is derived from a result by Gehrke [ Geh16b,
Thm. 3.19], where it is shown to capture precisely the conditions satisfied by the duals
of morphisms of binary Stone algebras.
(2)We speak about relational morphisms of residuation algebras since for finite algebras
these will dualize precisely to relational morphisms of finite monoids. Recall that a relational
morphism from a finite monoid MtoNis a total relation ρ:M→ P+Nsatisfying
ρ(x)ρ(y)⊆ρ(xy)and 1N∈ρ(1M). (5.1)
Relational morphisms represent inverses of surjective monoid homomorphisms [ RS09, p. 38].
More precisely, the inverse relation h−1of a surjective monoid homomorphism h:N↠Mis
a relational morphism; conversely, if a relational morphism h−1:M→ P+Nis the inverse of
a function h:N→M, then his a surjective monoid homomorphism.
Categorically, we can consider an inverse relation e−1:M→ PNof a surjective map
e:N↠Mas is itsright adjoint in the order-enriched category Rel≃SetPof sets andEXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 23
relations: as relations they satisfy idN≤e−1·eande·e−1≤idM. Under duality the
composition is reversed, so an inverse relation e−1dualizes to a left adjointde−1⊣be. Since
left adjoints between finite lattices are precisely the join-preserving functions, this justifies
our choice that relational morphisms of residuation algebras preserve finite joins (and not
necessarily meets). Note also that totality of e−1is equivalent to surjectivity of e, which by
Corollary 4.9 dualizes to the property thatde−1preserves the top element.
(3)Thisisalsotherationalebehindthenamingfor openresiduationmorphisms: if e:M↠N
is a continuous surjection between Stone monoids then e−1:N→VMis continuous precisely
iffeis an open map.
For open residuation morphisms the three conditions (Back),(Forth),(Unit)can be
replaced by two equivalent, yet much simpler conditions. Over finite residuation algebras
this is particularly convenient since every residuation morphism is open.
Lemma 5.12. LetR, Sbe unital residuation algebras. A lattice morphism f:R→Swith a
left adjoint f∗:S→Ris an open residuation morphism iff it satisfies the equations
f∗(e′) =e, ∀y∈S, z∈R:y\f(z) =f(f∗(y)\z), (Open)
and the same equation for the right residual /.
In the proof below we omit mentioning the right residual because the arguments for it are
completely analogous. This will be the case in most of the subsequent proofs involving
properties of residuals.
Proof.We first show that if fsatisfies(Open), then it is an open residuation morphism. The
(Forth) condition follows from f∗·f≤idand contravariance of \in the first argument:
f(x\z)≤f(f∗(f(x))\z) =f(x)\f(z).
For the(Back)condition, given y∈Sandz∈Rwe choose the element xy,z=f∗(y)∈R
(independently of z). The unit of the adjunction yields y≤f(f∗(y)) =f(xy,z), and using
(Open) we obtain
y\f(z) =f(f∗(y)\z) =f(xy,z\z).
For the other direction, we prove that every open residuation morphism satisfies the
condition (Open). Let (y, z)∈S×R. By the (Back)condition, there exists xy,z∈Rsuch
thaty≤f(xy,z)andy\f(z) =f(xy,z\z). This implies f∗(y)≤xy,z, and using (Back)and
contravariance of \in the first argument, we obtain
y\f(z) =f(xy,z\z)≤f(f∗(y)\z).
On the other hand, the adjunction unit y≤f(f∗(y)),(Forth)and contravariance of \yield
f(f∗(y)\z)≤f(f∗(y))\f(z)≤y\f(z).
This proves that findeed satisfies (Open).
For the respective unitality conditions we have by f∗⊣fthat
∀x:e≤x⇔e′≤f(x)⇔f∗(e′)≤x,
which is equivalent to e=f∗(e′).24 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
Example 5.13. LetΣand∆be finite alphabets. Every substitution f0:Σ→∆∗can be
extended to a monoid homomorphism f:Σ∗→∆∗, and for regular languages L∈RegΣ
andK∈Reg∆, both f[L]andf−1[K]are also regular. Then f−1: Reg ∆→RegΣis
an open residuation morphism. Indeed, its left adjoint is given by the direct image map
f[−]: Reg Σ →Reg ∆, satisfying f[{ε}] ={f(ε)}={ε}and
K\f−1[L] ={w|Kw⊆f−1[L]}={w|f[K]f(w)⊆L}=f−1(f[K]\L).
5.3.Finite Residuation Algebras. We will now characterize finiteresiduation algebras,
and then generalize the results to locally finite residuation algebras in Section 5.4. This
approach allows us to first introduce the key concepts and constructions of the duality on a
finite level, and then extend them to more general structures by forming appropriate free
completions. All results of this section apply more generally to structures with a complete
and completely distributive lattice, respectively, as carrier and will be used in their complete
form in Section 6.
Construction 5.14. (1)Every U∨-algebra U∨D⊗U∨D→U∨Don a finite lattice Dhas a
right adjoint γ:U∧D→U∧(D⊗D)that can be extended, by using the isomorphism ωfrom
Lemma 5.4, to a U∧-coalgebra
¯γ=U∧ω·γ:U∧D→U∧(D⊗D)∼=U∧(D⊠D) =U∧D⊠U∧D.
We refer to both versions γand¯γascomultiplication orcoalgebra structure . Conversely, we
obtain a U∨-algebra from a comultiplication γ:U∧D→U∧(D⊗D)by taking its left adjoint.
(2)In a finite residuation algebra Rthe partially applied residuals have respective left
adjoints µ(x,−)⊣(x\ −)andµ(−, y)⊣(−/ y)that can be combined into a U∨-algebra
structure µ:U∨R⊗U∨R→U∨Rthat we call multiplication . By part (1), the multiplication
µinduces the comultiplication γ:U∧R→U∧(R⊗R), or¯γ:U∧R→U∧R⊠U∧R.
Each of the operators /,\,µ,γdetermines the others uniquely due to the equivalences
x≤z / y ⇐⇒ y≤x\z⇐⇒ µ(x⊗y)≤z⇐⇒ x⊗y≤γ(z).
The following lemma provides the concrete formulas.
Lemma 5.15. LetRbe a finite residuation algebra.
(1)The residuals can be calculated from the comultiplication:
x\z=x⊸γ(z)and z / y =γ(z)⊸y,
where⊸and ⊸are the tensor implications given by Proposition 5.5.
(2)The comultiplication can be calculated from the residuals:
γ(z) =_
x∈Rx⊗(x\z) =_
p∈JRp⊗(p\z).
Proof.(1) For all x, y, z ∈Rwe have
y≤x\z⇐⇒ µ(x⊗y)≤z⇐⇒ x⊗y≤γ(z)⇐⇒ y≤x⊸γ(z),
and analogously x≤z / y =γ(z)⊸y.EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 25

p≤xp⊗x\z≤_

where pranges over JRand we use contravariance of (− \z)in the last step.
We now investigate when the comultiplication is a pure, that is, lifts to a lattice morphism
R→R+Rand thus corresponds to a pure multiplication.
Lemma 5.16. For a finite residuation algebra R, the following are equivalent:
(1)The comultiplication is pure: γ(0) = 0andγ(x∨y) =γ(x)∨γ(y).
(2)For all p∈ JRwe have p\0 = 0 = 0 / p, and the following equations hold:
p\(x∨y) =p\x∨p\yand (x∨y)/ p=x / p∨y / p.
(3)For all x, y∈R:µ(x⊗y) = 0 ⇐⇒ x= 0∨y= 0, and µ[J(R+R)]⊆ JR.
Proof.(1)⇐⇒(3). First, we have
γ(0) = 0 ⇐⇒ γ(0)≤0
⇐⇒ ∀ T:T≤γ(0)⇒T≤0
⇐⇒ ∀ T=_
ixi⊗yi:µ(T) =_
iµ(xi⊗yi)≤0⇒ ∀i:xi⊗yi≤0
⇐⇒ ∀ x, y:µ(x⊗y) = 0⇒x⊗y= 0
⇐⇒ ∀ x, y:µ(x⊗y) = 0⇔x= 0∨y= 0,
where we use in the penultimate equivalence that µ(0) = 0, and in the last equivalence that
x⊗y= 0iffx= 0ory= 0. To show that γpreserves joins, note that the join-irreducibles
ofR⊗Rare given by pure tensors of p⊗qof join-irreducibles p, q∈ JRand that in a
distributive lattice an element jis join-irreducible iff it is is join-prime :j≤x∨yimplies
j≤xorj≤y. Given x, y∈R, we compute:
γ(x∨y) =γ(x)∨γ(y)
⇐⇒∀ a, b∈ JR:a⊗b≤γ(x∨y)⇒a⊗b≤γ(x)∨γ(y)
⇐⇒∀ a, b∈ JR:a⊗b≤γ(x∨y)⇒[a⊗b≤γ(x)ora⊗b≤γ(y)]
⇐⇒∀ a, b∈ JR:µ(a⊗b)≤x∨y⇒[µ(a⊗b)≤xorµ(a⊗b)≤y]
⇐⇒∀ a⊗b∈ J[R⊗R] :µ(a⊗b)∈ JR.

(p\ −) =p⊸γ(−)forp∈ JR; and if every (p\ −)preserves finite joins, then so does
γ=W
p∈JRp⊗p\(−).
Next we show how structural identities like (co-)associativity or unitality translate
between γ,µand the residuals. . Note that while the statements are to be expected, the proof
is non-trivial due to the complication introduced by the seemingly innocent isomorphism
ω:R⊗R∼=R⊠R. Recall that a coalgebra c:U∧R→U∧R⊠U∧Riscoassociative if
(c⊠id)·c= (id⊠c)·candcounital if it is equipped with a counit ε∈DL(R,2)satisfying
(ε⊠id)·c=id= (id⊠ε)·c. Diagrammatically, these equations are dual to the well-known
monoid equations:
U∧C U∧C⊠U∧C U∧C⊠U∧C U∧C U∧C⊠U∧C
U∧C⊠U∧C U∧C⊠U∧C⊠U∧C U∧C⊠2 U∧C 2⊠U∧Cc
c id⊠c id⊠εc c
ε⊠id
c⊠id ∼=∼=
Lemma 5.17. The following are equivalent for a finite residuation algebra R:
(1)The comultiplication on Ris coassociative and has a counit.
(2)The residuals are associative and Rhas a unit.
(3)The multiplication µis associative and has a unit, that is, there exists a join-irreducible
element e∈ JRsatisfying µ(e⊗ −) = id = µ(− ⊗e).
Proof.For the proof we only use ‘adjunctional calculus’. The equivalence (3) ⇐⇒(2) follows
from uniqueness of adjoints; to see this, we write associativity of µas
∀x, y:µ(− ⊗y)·µ(x⊗ −) =µ(x⊗ −)·µ(− ⊗y)
and associativity of the residuals as
∀x, y: (x\ −)·(−/ y) = (−/ y)·(x\ −).
Since the respective left and right sides of the above equalities are adjoint, and adjoints are
unique, it is clear that one of the equations hold iff the other one does. The equivalence of
the (co-)unit properties is analogous.
The equivalence (1) ⇐⇒(3) is shown similarly, but we have to be careful, since µ
and¯γare adjoint only up to composition with the isomorphism ω:R⊗R→R⊠R. ByEXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 27
Lemma 5.4(2), we have the following diagram of adjunctions:
R

The left and right diamonds come from the horizontal composition of adjunctions under
the respective tensor products. The bottom diamond is easily seen to commute. If µis
associative the top inner diamond commutes, and so by uniqueness the outer big diamond
commutes by uniqueness of adjoints, proving ¯γcoassociative. Dually, if ¯γis coassociative,
then µis associative. The unit of µis the left adjoint of the counit of gamma.
These lemmas suggest the following definitions.
Definition 5.18. (1)A finite residuation algebra Rispureif it satisfies one of the equivalent
conditions of Lemma 5.16.
(2)Afinite derivation algebra is a pure finite residuation algebra that satisfies the equivalent
conditions of Lemma 5.17. We denote the respective full subcategories by

(3)AU∧-coalgebra ¯γ:U∧C→U∧C⊠U∧Cis aU∧-comonoid if its coassociative and counital,
and acomonoid if¯γis pure.
In order to extend the correspondence of (finite) residuation algebras and U∧-coalgebras
to a categorical equivalence we introduce appropriate morphisms.
Definition 5.19. (1)Apure morphism from a counital U∧-coalgebra (C,¯γ, ϵ)to(C′,¯γ′, ϵ′)

The category of counital U∧-coalgebras with pure morphisms is denoted by Coalg (U∧)
and its full subcategory of U∧-comonoids by Comon (U∧), again with the full subcategory
Comon of comonoids.28 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
(2)LetCandC′be comonoids. A (lax) relational morphism from CtoC′is a morphism

Comonoids with relational morphisms form a category RelComon .
Recall from Lemma 5.12 that over finite residuation algebras every residuation morphism
is open.
Proposition 5.20. LetRandR′be finite residuation algebras with unit.
(1)A lattice morphism is a pure coalgebra morphism iff it is an residuation morphism.
(2)IfRandR′are comonoids, then ρ∈JSL 1(R, R′)is a relational comonoid morphism iff
it is a (unital) relational residuation morphism.
Proof.(1) First, let fbe a pure coalgebra morphism. Then

Postcomposition with ωagain yields ¯γ′f≥(f⊠f)¯γ. Hence, we obtain ¯γ′f= (f⊠f)¯γ,
sofis a pure coalgebra morphism. Moreover, it is clear that the counit condition from
Definition 5.19(1) is equivalent to the unit conditions from (Open), since (1) e⊣ϵand
f∗(e)⊣ϵ′·f, and (2) adjoints are unique, so either equations holds iff the other one does.

Theorem 5.21. The following categories are isomorphic:
Coalgf(U∧)∼=Res f,Comon f∼=Der fand RelComon f∼=RelDer f.
Proof.The three isomorphisms are given on objects by swapping between residuals and
comultiplication (note that the residual unit is a left adjoint of the counit of the comultipli-
cation), and act as identity on morphisms. Lemma 5.16 and 5.17 and Proposition 5.20 show
that they are well-defined.30 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
From Theorem 5.21 we obtain a dual characterization of finite ordered monoids; it
restricts to a duality between finite (discrete) monoids and finite boolean derivation algebras.
Theorem 5.22. (1)The category of finite ordered monoids is dually equivalent to the category
of finite derivation algebras (or finite lattice comonoids):
OrdMon f≃opComon f∼=Der f.
(2)The category of finite ordered monoids and relational morphisms is dually equivalent to the
category of finite derivation algebras (or finite lattice comonoids) and relational morphisms:
RelOrdMon f≃opRelComon f∼=RelDer f.
Here, arelational morphism of ordered monoids MandNis a total relation ρ:M→ DN

Proof.The first statement is a trivial extension of Theorem 5.21 by (finite) Priestley duality
since finite ordered monoids dualize to finite lattice comonoids. For the second statement,
letρ:M→ DNbe a relational morphism of finite ordered monoids. If we view Nas a finite
Priestley space, then DN=V↓N, so the dual of ρunder (order-enriched) extended duality
is a relational morphism bρ−∈JSL 1(bN,cM)of finite lattice comonoids, or equivalently by
Proposition 5.20, a relational residuation morphism.
5.4.Locally Finite Residuation Algebras. We now generalize the results from Section 5.3
to infinite (but locally finite) structures. The main challenge arises from the reliance on
adjoints in the finite case, whose existence is of course not ensured for non-finite distributive
lattices. We start with the motivating example from automata theory: the residuation
algebra on regular languages from Example 5.8.(4).
Example 5.23. It is well known that the boolean algebra RegΣof regular languages dualizes
under Stone duality to the Stone space Σ∗ofprofinite words1(see e.g. Pippenger [ Pip97]).
The space Σ∗can be constructed as the limit in the category of Stone spaces of the diagram
of all finite quotient monoids of Σ∗, regarded as discrete spaces. It is equipped with a
continuous monoid structure µ:Σ∗×Σ∗→Σ∗extending the concatenation of words. We
calculate below that its dual comultiplication on regular languages under Stone duality is
given as follows:
γ: Reg Σ → Reg Σ + Reg Σ
L 7→_
[v]∈SynL[v]⊗[v]\L,(5.2)
where SynLis thesyntactic monoid ofL; its elements are the equivalence classes of the
syntactic congruence relation relation on Σ∗defined by
[v] = [w]iff ∀K, K′⊆Σ∗:v∈K\L / K′⇐⇒ w∈K\L / K′.
1This space is commonly denoted cΣ∗in the literature; we use the notation Σ∗to avoid a clash with
notationd(−)for the dual equivalence.EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 31
The Stone monoid Σ∗isprofinite, that is, it is the (cofiltered) limit of the diagram of its
finite continuous monoid quotients. Therefore, by duality, RegΣis the filtered colimit of
its finite sub-coalgebras PM∼=cM ,→cΣ∗∼=Reg Σdual to finite monoid quotients Σ∗↠M.
This means that, given a regular language L, we can compute the value of γ(L)using Syn(L)
as in the following diagram:
Reg Σ Cl(Σ∗) Cl(Σ∗×Σ∗) Cl(Σ∗)+Cl( Σ∗) Reg Σ+Reg Σ

The key to extending the ‘finite’ duality of Theorem 5.22 is the notion of residuation ideal
of a residuation algebra. It was introduced by Gehrke [ Geh16b] to characterize quotients
of Priestley topological algebras. In particular, she has shown [ Geh16a, Thm. 15] that the
Stone monoid quotient SynLofΣ∗dualizes to the residuation ideal generated by L∈RegΣ
Definition 5.24. Aresiduation ideal of a residuation algebra Ris a sublattice I ,→Rclosed
under derivatives w.r.t. arbitrary elements of R:
∀z∈R, x∈I:x\z∈Iandz / x∈I.32 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
In particular, every residuation ideal is a residuation subalgebra of R. We denote the
residuation ideal generated by a subset X⊆Rby\X/.
Example 5.23 suggests a path to extending our constructions of Section 5.3 from finite
to infinite residuation algebras: extend them locally, that is, by considering suitable finite
substructures. Note that in the formula (5.2)for the comultiplication on regular languages it
is crucial that the residuation ideal \{L}/generated by a single regular language Lisfinite,
so that the join (#)is defined.
Definition 5.25. (1)A residuation algebra Rislocally finite if every finite subset of Ris
contained in a finite residuation ideal of R.
(2)AU∧-coalgebra Cislocally finite if every finite subset of Cis contained in a finite
subcoalgebra of C. The category of locally finite comonoids is denoted Comon lf.
Note that not every residuation algebra is locally finite, consider for example an infinite
boolean algebra in Example 5.8.(2).
Proposition 5.26. (1)Every locally finite residuation algebra Rinduces a locally finite
U∧-coalgebra γ\:U∧R→U∧(R⊗R)where
γ\(z) = (ιA⊗ιA)(γA(z)) =_
x∈AιA(x)⊗ιA(x\z) =_
p∈JAιA(p)⊗ιA(p\z),
for every finite residuation ideal ιA:A ,→Rcontaining z(here γAis the comultiplication
onAas in Construction 5.14).
(2)Every locally finite U∧-coalgebra (C, γ)induces a locally finite residuation algebra where
x\γz=ιA(x⊸γ(z)), z / γx=ιA(γ(z)⊸x),
for every finite subcoalgebra ιA:A ,→Ccontaining x, z(here\Ais the residual on Aas
given by Construction 5.14). The residuals have a canonical presentation as
x\γz=ιz(ι∗
z(x)\z)and z /γx=ιz(z / ι∗
z(x))
where ιz:⟨z⟩ →Cis the smallest (finite) subcoalgebra containing z.
(3)These constructions are mutually inverse:
γ\γ=γand \γ\=\.
Proof.(1a)We first show that the comultiplication γ\= (ιA⊗ιA)(γ(z))is well-defined, that
is, it does not depend on the residuation ideal Acontaining z. We first prove an auxiliary
statement:
Lemma 5.27. IfιI=ιK·ι:I ,→K ,→Rare finite residuation ideals containing z, then
(ιI⊗ιI)(γI(z)) = ( ιK⊗ιK)(γK(ι(z))). (5.3)
Proof.Since I⊆K, it is clear that
(ιI⊗ιI)(γI(z)) = ( ιI⊗ιI)(_
x∈Ix⊗x\z)
≤(ιK⊗ιK)(_
x∈Kx⊗x\z)
= (ιK⊗ιK)(γK(ι(z))).EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 33
For the reverse inequality, note that for every join-prime q∈ JKwe find p∈ JIsuch that
q≤ι(p), since
q≤ ⊤=ι(⊤) =ι(_
p∈JIp) =_
p∈JIι(p)
andqis join-irreducible. We use this to calculate
(ιK⊗ιK)(γK(ι(z))) =_

p∈JIιI(p)⊗ιI(p\z) ( ∗∗∗)

For step (∗), we use that for p∈ JI, q∈ JKsuch that q≤ι(p), the following holds:
ιK(q\ι(z)) =ιK(q)\ιK(ι(z))
=ιK(q)\ιI(z)
=ιI(ι∗

=ιI(ι∗(ι∗
K(ιK(q)))\z) ιI=ιKι
=ιI(ι∗(q)\z) ιKembedding.
Simlarly, for step (∗∗)we use have
ιK=ιK·id≤ιK·ι·ι∗=ιI·ι∗.
Lastly, for step (∗∗∗)note that for every q∈ JKwe have ι∗(q)∈ J(I): indeed, ι∗(q)≤x∨y
inIimplies q≤ι(x)∨ι(y)inK, hence q≤ι(x)orq≤ι(y), soι∗(q)≤xorι∗(q)≤y. In
particular for all q∈ JKwe find some p∈ JIwith
ιIι∗(q)⊗ιI(ι∗(q)\z) =ιI(p)⊗(ιI(p)\z),
which implies (∗∗∗).
Now, for well-definedness of γ\, ifI, I′are finite residuation ideals containing zthey
are both contained in a finite residuation ideal K, since that Ris locally finite; we write
ι:I ,→K←- I′:ι′for the inclusion maps. Now we have
(ιI⊗ιI)(γI(z)) = ( ιK⊗ιK)(ι⊗ι)(γ(z)) (5.3)
= (ιK⊗ιK)(γK(ι(z))) ιcoalgebra morphism
= (ιK⊗ιK)(γK(ι′(z))) ι, ι′subcoalgebras of K
= (ιI′⊗ιI′)(γI′(z)) backwards.
This shows that the mapping
γ\:R7→R⊗R, z 7→(ιI⊗ιI)(γ(z))
does not depend on the choice of the residuation ideal I.34 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
(1b)We show that the mapping γ\indeed yields a U∧-coalgebra structure, that is, it preserves
finite meets. Let F⊆Rbe a finite subset. By local finiteness we find a residuation ideal I
containing F. Now we simply use that both the comultiplication on IandιI⊗ιIpreserve
finite meets:
γ\(^
x∈Fx) = (ιI⊗ιI)(γ(^
x∈Fx)) =^
x∈F(ιI⊗ιI)(γ(x)) =^
x∈Fγ\(x).
(1c)The coalgebra is easily seen to be locally finite, since for every finite subset X⊆Rwe
find a finite residuation ideal Icontaining X, and the corresponding coalgebra structure
onIis by definition a subcoalgebra of (R, γ\).
(2a) We first show that for finite subcoalgebras A, A′ofRcontaining both x, zwe have
ιA(x\z) =ιA′(x\z).
First, let ιB·ι:A ,→B ,→Rbe finite subcoalgebras. Then
ιA(x\z) =ιA(x⊸γ(z))
=ιB(ι(x⊸γ(z)))
=ιB(ι(x)⊸(ι⊗ι)(γ(z))) embeddings preserve ⊸
=ιB(ι(x)⊸γ(ι(z))) ιcoalgebra morphism
=ιB(ι(x)\ι(z)).
From this it follows that
ιB(x\ι(z)) =ιB(x⊸(ι⊗ι)(γ(z))) = ιB(ι(ι∗(x)⊸γ(z))) = ιA(ι∗(x)\z).(5.4)
Now let A ,→Cbe a finite subcoalgebra containing xandz. Then Acertainly contains the
(finite) subcoalgebra ⟨z⟩generated by z; we write ι:⟨z⟩,→Afor its inclusion into A. We
now obtain the canonical expression, where the last step uses (5.4)
x\γz=ιA(x\z) =ιA(x\ι(z)) =ι⟨z⟩(ι∗(x)\z)
For general finite subcoalgebras A, A′,→Rcontaining x, zwe find an upper bound ι:A ,→
B←- A′:ι′and compute
ιA(x\z) =ιB(ι(x)\ι(z)) =ιB(ι′(x)\ι′(z)) =ιA′(x\z).

(2c)The residuation algebra structure induced by γis locally finite: Since the coalgebra
(C, γ)is locally finite, every finite subset F⊆Cis contained in a finite subcoalgebra A ,→C.
The finite residuation algebra structure on Agiven by Lemma 5.15(2) makes Aa residuation
subalgebra of (C,\γ)containing F.EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 35

(3)The translations are inverse since they are liftings of the translations between the
operators on the finite substructures: We first show that γ\γ=γ. For every z∈R, the
subcoalgebra ιz:⟨z⟩,→Rgenerated by zis a residuation ideal of \γ: For all x∈R, we have
x\γz=ιz(ι∗
z(x)⊸γ(z))∈ ⟨z⟩.
We can therefore choose it as a residuation ideal containing zin the definition of γ\γto get
γ\γ(z) = (ιz⊗ιz)(γ\γ(z)) = ( ιz⊗ιz)(γ(z)) =γ(z).
An analogous argument proves \γ\=\.
Proposition 5.26 shows that every locally finite residuation algebra carries a unique
U∧-coalgebra structure and vice versa. We may thus translate at will between the residuals
and comultiplication as in the finite case and omit the subscripts. We extend Lemmas 5.16
and 5.17 to locally finite structures:
Lemma 5.28. LetRbe a locally finite residuation algebra.
(1)Finite residuation ideals correspond to finite subcoalgebras.
(2)The residuals are associative iff the comultiplication is coassociative.
(3)The residuals have a unit iff the comultiplication is counital.
(4)The comultiplication is pure iff every finite residuation ideal is pure (see Definition 5.18).
Proof.(1)IfιI:I ,→Ris a finite residuation ideal, then by definition its comultiplication
makes Ia subcoalgebra of (R, γ).
In the reserve direction, let A ,→Rbe a finite subcoalgebra. The residuation algebra
structure on Adue to Lemma 5.15(1) together with the definition x\z=ιA(x\z)of the
residuation algebra structure on Rshow that Ais a residuation subalgebra of R. To show
that Ais a residuation ideal, let x∈Randz∈A. There exists a finite subcoalgebra B
containing x, z; we denote the inclusion map by ι:A ,→B. By (5.4) we then have
x\z=ιB(x\z) =ιA(ι∗(x)\z),
which states that x\zlies in A.
(2)First, let γbe the coassociative comultiplication, and let x, y, z ∈R. By local finiteness
these elements are contained in a finite coassociative subcoalgebra ιA:A ,→R. Then by
Lemma 5.28(1), ιA, is an associative finite residuation ideal of R, whence
x\(z / y) =ιA(x\(z / y)) =ιA((x\z)/ y) = (x\z)/ y.36 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
The other direction works analogous: if the residuals are associative and z∈R, then it is
contained in a finite associative residuation ideal ιI:I ,→R. So Iis a finite associative
subcoalgebra of Rand we have
(¯γ⊠id)(¯γ(ιI(z))) = ( ιI⊠ιI⊠ιI)((¯γ⊠id)(¯γ(z)))
= (ιI⊠ιI⊠ιI)((id⊠¯γ)(¯γ(z)))
= (id⊠¯γ)(¯γ(ιI(z))),
proving that ¯γis associative.
(3) Let ϵ:R→2be a counit for the comultiplication
¯γ=ω·γ:U∧R→U∧(R⊗R)∼=U∧R⊠U∧R
with left adjoint element e∈JSL(2, R)∼=R. Note that ϵ·ιAis a counit for every subcoalgebra
ιA:A ,→R: Let z∈A, then, since ϵis a unit for ¯γ, we have
ιA(((ϵ·ιA)⊠idA)(¯γ(z))) = ( ϵ⊠id)(ιA⊠ιA)(¯γ(z)) = ( ϵ⊠id)(¯γ(ιA(z))) = ιA(z).
But by the implication (1) ⇒(2) of Lemma 5.17 this means that the left adjoint eA:=
ι∗
A(e)∈Aofϵ·ιAis a unit for the finite residuation ideal AofR. So for all z∈Rwe have
e\z=ιz(ι∗
z(e)\z) =ιz(ez\z) =ιz(z) =z,
soeis a unit for the residuals. The case for the right residual /is dual.
For the other direction let e∈Rbe a unit for the residuals with right adjoint ϵ:R→2.
For every residuation ideal ιI:I ,→Rthe element ι∗
I(e)∈Iis the unit of I: The embedding
trivially is an open residuation morphism, and we have
ιI(ι∗
I(e)\z) =e\ιI(z) =ιI(z)for every z∈I.
So the subcoalgebra structure Ihas the counit ϵ·ιI. Now given z∈R, we pick a residuation
ideal Icontaining zusing that Ris locally finite. Then we have
(ϵ⊠id)(¯γ(z)) = ( ϵ⊠id)(¯γ(ιI(z)))
= (ϵ⊠id)((ιI⊠ιI)(¯γ(z)))
=ιI((ϵιI⊠id)(¯γ(z)))
=ιI(z) =z.
This shows that ϵis a counit for ¯γ.
(4)If the comultiplication is pure, associative and has a counit, then this holds for every
finite subcoalgebra. Every finite residuation ideal IofRis a finite pure subcoalgebra, which
therefore is a derivation algebra.
Conversely, if every finite residuation ideal is a derivation algebra, then we only have
to show that the comultiplication preserves finite joins, since it already is coassociative and
has a counit. The join of finitely many elements is taken in some finite subcoalgebra A.
ButAis a finite residuation ideal and therefore by assumption a derviation algebra, and the
comultiplication preserves finite joins.
Remark 5.29. Lemma 5.28(4) characterizes locally finite residuation algebras with a pure co-
multiplication. By extended duality, its dual Priestley relation is functional. Gehrke [ Geh16b,EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 37
Prop. 3.15] has presented a necessary and sufficient condition for a general residuation
algebra Rto have a functional dual relation, namely join-preservation at primes :
∀F∈DL(R,2):∀a∈F:∀b, c∈R:∃a′∈F:a\(b∨c)≤(a′\b)∨(a′\c).
One can indeed show that every locally finite residuation algebra with a pure comultiplication
(Lemma 5.28(4)) is join-preserving at primes: If Fis a prime filter on Canda∈F, then we
obtain by local finiteness for all b, c∈Ca finitepureresiduation ideal ι:I ,→Ccontaining
a, b, c. In this residuation ideal we have a=WKfor join-irreducibles K⊆ JI⊆C. Since F
is prime, some a′∈Klies in F, and it satisfies
a\(b∨c) =ι(a\(b∨c))
=ι((_
K)\(b∨c))
≤ι(a′\(b∨c)) ( −)\xantimonotone
=ι(a′\b∨a′\c) Iis pure
=ι(a′\b)∨ι(a′\c)
= (a′\b)∨(a′\c) a′, b, c∈I.
This shows that the residuals are join-preserving at primes.
Definition 5.30. A residuation algebra Ris aderivation algebra if it is locally finite,
associative, unital and every finite residuation ideal Iis pure. This yields full subcategories
Der,→Res and RelRes ,→RelDer .
Note a derivation algebra with a finite carrier is precisely a finite derivation algebra as
defined in Definition 5.18(2).
Proposition 5.31. LetR, R′be locally finite residuation algebras with units.
(1)A lattice morphism f∈DL(R, R′)is a residuation morphism iff it is a counital morphism
ofU∧-coalgebras.
(2)IfR, R′are comonoids, a finite join-preserving function ρ∈JSL(R, R′)is a relational
residuation morphism iff it is a relational comonoid morphism.
Proof.(1)First, let f:R→R′be a residuation morphism. For z∈Rwe choose a finite
residuation ideal I′,→R′containing f(z). Since fis a residuation morphism we have by
the(Back)condition that for every y∈I′there exists some xy,zwith y≤f(xy,z)and
y\f(z) =f(xy,z\z). We now choose a finite ideal I ,→Rcontaining zand all xy,zfor
y∈I′. We therefore have

For the reverse inequality let z∈Rbe contained in the finite residuation ideal I. We choose
a finite residuation ideal J ,→R′containing f(z)and all f(x), x∈I, and use (Forth):
(f⊗f)(γ\(z)) =_

This proves that fis a morphism of U∧-coalgebras.
Conversely, let f:R→R′be a morphism of U∧-coalgebras. For every z∈Rthe
morphism frestricts to the finite subcoalgebras generated by z, f(z)asfz:⟨z⟩ → ⟨ f(z)⟩.
If we denote the respective inclusions by ιz:⟨z⟩,→Randιf(z):⟨f(z)⟩,→R′, then this is
equivalent to saying that f·ιz=ιf(z)·fz. From the unit of ιzwe thus get
f≤f·ιz·ι∗
z=ιf(z)·fz·ι∗
z,
which under transposition is equivalent to

(2)Now let R, R′be comonoids and let f∈JSL(R, R′)be a relational comonoid morphism.
Forx, z∈Rwe choose a finite subcomonoid ι:I ,→Rthat contains x, zand a finite
subcomonoid ι′:I′,→R′(with comultiplication γ′) containing ρ[I]. Then ρrestricts to
a relational morphism ρ:I→I′of finite comonoids. By Theorem 5.21 ρis a relational
morphism of finite residuation algebras, so it satisfies ρ(a\γb)≤ρ(a)\γ′ρ(b)for all a, b∈I.
We therefore get
ρ(x\γz) =ρ(ι(x\γz)) =ι′(ρ(x\γz))≤ι′(ρ(x)\γ′ρ(z)) =ρ(x)\γ′(z).
which proves that fis a relational residuation morphism. To verify e′≤ρ(e)we again choose
finite subcoalgebras A, A′with e∈Aandρ[A]∪ {e′} ⊆A′. Since ρis counital it satisfies
ϵ≤ϵ′·ρand therefore also ϵ·ιA≤ϵ′·ρ·ιA=ϵ′·ιA′·ρ. As ϵ·ιAandϵ′·ιA′are the
counits for AandA′, respectively, its restriction ρ:A→A′is thus also counital and whence
satisfies ι∗
A(e)≤ρ(ι∗
A′(e′))for the corresponding units of the residuals on A, A′. But e∈A
ande′∈A′, so this equation simplifies to the desired e≤ρ(e′).
Conversely, if fis a relational residuation morphism choose for z∈Ra finite residuation
ideal ι:I ,→Rcontaining zand a finite residuation ideal ι′:I′,→Rcontaining ρ[I]. Then
we have
(ρ⊗ρ)(γ(z)) = ( ρ⊗ρ)(γ(ι(z)))
= (ρ⊗ρ)(ι⊗ι)(γ(z))
= (ι′⊗ι′)(ρ⊗ρ)(γ(z))
≤(ι′⊗ι′)γ(ρ(z))
=γ(ρ(z)),
soρis a relational residuation morphism. To show that ϵ≤ϵ′·ρ, take z∈Rwith ideals I, I′
chosen as before. Recall that ι∗(e)is a unit of the residuation ideal Iandϵ·ιis a counit for
the corresponding subcoalgebra. Since ρis unital it satisfies
e′≤ρ(e)≤ρ(ι(ι∗(e))) = ι′(ρ(ι∗(e)))
which is equivalent to ι′∗(e′)≤ρ(ι∗(e)). Since ρ:I→I′is a relational residuation morphism
it is relational morphism of the coalgebra structures on I, I′and we thus get
ϵ(z) =ϵ(ι(z))≤ϵ′(ι′(ρ(z))) = ϵ′(ρ(ι(z))) = ϵ′(ρ(z)).
Remark 5.32. The proof of Proposition 5.31 gives an alternative formulation of the (Back)
condition for locally finite residuation algebras as
y\f(z) =f((ιz·f∗
z·ι∗
f(z))(y)\z).40 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS

Compare this with Equation (Open)satisfied by open residuation morphisms, where the

independently of z.
We then have the following extension of Theorem 5.21 to locally finite structures:
Theorem 5.33. (1)The category of locally finite residuation algebras and residuation mor-
phisms is isomorphic to the category of locally finite unital U∧-coalgebras and pure coalgebra
morphisms.
(2)This isomorphism restricts to an isomorphism between the full subcategories of derivation
algebras and locally finite comonoids.
(3)The category of derivation algebras and relational residuation morphisms is isomorphic
to the category of locally finite comonoids with relational morphisms.
Proof.Immediate from Lemma 5.28 and Proposition 5.31.
Combining this characterization with our approach to extended Priestley duality we
establish a duality between profinite ordered monoids and derivation algebras and extend
it to relational morphisms. Conceptually, this general duality is an extension of the finite
duality OrdMon f≃opComon f∼=Der fby forming suitable completions.
Remark 5.34. TheInd-completion (orfree completion under filtered colimits ) of a small
category Cis given by a category Ind(C)with filtered (equivalently directed) colimits and a
full embedding I:C,→Ind(C)such that every functor F:C→Dinto a category Dwith
filtered colimits extends to a functor F: Ind (C)→D, unique up to natural isomorphism,
such that F=F·I. To show that a category Dis the Ind-completion of a full subcategory
C, it suffices to prove the following (see e.g. [ACMU21, Thm. A.4]):
(1)Dhas filtered colimits,
(2) every object of Dis a filtered colimit of objects of C, and
(3)every object CofCis finitely presentable in D, that is, the functor D(C,−):D→Set
preserves filtered colimits.
ThePro-completion (orfree completion under cofiltered limits ) ofCis defined dually.
Profinite ordered monoids form the Pro-completion of the category of finite ordered
monoids. Dually, lattice comonoids (and therefore also derivation algebras by Theo-
rem 5.33(2)) form Ind-completions of their respective subcategories of finite objects:EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 41
Proposition 5.35. The category of locally finite comonoids forms the Ind-completion of the
category of finite comonoids:
Comon lf≃Ind(Comon f).
Proof.(a) We first show that filtered colimits of lattice comonoids are formed in Set. First,
since DLis a category of algebras over a finitary signature, filtered colimits in DLare
formed in Set. Second, since +:DL×DL→DLis a finitary functor (colimits commute
with colimits) filtered colimits in the category of +-coalgebras are also formed in Set. As
comonoids are a full subcategory of +-coalgebras it suffices to show that the filtered colimit in
+-coalgebras of lattice comonoids is again a comonoid, which is a straightforward verification:
Letdi:Di→Di+Di, i∈Ibe a cofiltered diagram of comonoids, and let d:D→D+D
be their colimit in the category of +-coalgebras with colimit injections κi:Di→D. Since
the colimit Dis formed in Set, there exists for every x∈Dsome i∈Iandxi∈Diwith
κi(xi) =x. But then
(d+ id)( d(x)) = ( d+ id) d(κi(xi))
= (d+ id)( κi+κi)(di(xi)) κicomonoid morphism
= ((d·κi) +κi)(di(xi))
= ((( κi+κi)·di) +κi)(di(xi)) κicomonoid morphism
= (κi+κi+κi)(di+ id)( di(xi))
= (κi+κi+κi)(id + di)(di(xi)) dicomonoid
=··· backwards
= (id + d)(d(x)),
soDis coassociative. Counitality works similarly for ϵ:D→2withϵ(x) =ϵ(κi(xi)) =ϵi(xi).
This proves that filtered colimits of comonoids are formed in Set.
(b) To prove that the category Comon lfis the Ind-completion of its full subcategory
Comon f, we verify the conditions of Remark 5.34:
(1)Comon lfhas filtered colimits: filtered colimits of comonoids are formed in Setby (a).
Moreover, a filtered colimit ci:Ci→C(i∈I) of locally finite comonoids is locally finite:
Given x∈Cone has x=ci(xi)for some i∈Iandxi∈Ci. Thus xi∈C′
ifor some finite
subcomonoid C′
iofCi, and so xilies in the finite subcomonoid ci[C′
i]⊆C.
(2)Every locally finite comonoid is the directed union of the diagram of all its finite
subcomonoids. This follows again from (a), since this is clearly a directed union in Set.
(3)Every finite comonoid is finitely presentable: A finite comonoid can be regarded as a
coalgebra C→2×(C+C)for the functor FX= 2×(X+X)onDLby pairing its counit
and comultiplication. Every finite F-coalgebra is finitely presentable in the category of
allF-coalgebras [ AP04, Lemma 3.2]. This implies the corresponding statement for finite
comonoids since they form a full subcategory of the category of F-coalgebras.
On the dual side, we require a property of Priestley monoids (Proposition 5.38 below),
namely that every Priestley monoid is profinite, that is, it is a cofiltered limit of finite ordered
monoids with the discrete topology. The corresponding result for (unordered) Stone monoids
is well known [ Joh82, Thm. VI.2.9]; its ordered version is analogous, and we give a full proof
for the convenience of the reader.42 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
We need some auxiliary results: First, we recall a well-known characterization for
quotients of ordered algebras, see e.g. [ MU19, Sec. B.2]. Recall that a preorder ⊑on an
ordered monoid Aisstableif⊑refines the order on A(i.e.≤is included in ⊑) and the
multiplication is monotone: a⊑b, a′⊑b′implies aa′⊑bb′.
Lemma 5.36. LetXbe an ordered monoid. Then ordered monoid quotients of Xare in
bijective correspondence with stable preorders on X.
Proof.A quotient e:A↠Binduces a stable preorder by putting a⊑a′iffe(a)≤e(a′)for
a, a′∈A. Conversely, from a stable preorder ⊑onA×Awe obtain an equivalence relation on
Aby identifying a∼a′iffa⊑a′anda′⊑a. Monotonicity of the multiplication then ensures
that multiplication on equivalence classes is well-defined. The refinement property ensures
that the canonical projection that sends an element to its equivalence class is order-preserving.
It is a routine verification to check that these constructions are inverses.
Lemma 5.37. LetXbe a Priestley monoid. If x̸≤y, then there exists a finite Priestley
monoid quotient f:X↠Msuch that fx̸≤fy
We modify the proof of a corresponding statement for Stone algebras given by John-
stone [Joh82, Ch. VI, Sec. 2.7].
Proof.Letx̸≤ybe elements of a Priestley monoid X, we show that there exists a quotient of
f:X↠Minto some finite discretely-topologized ordered monoid Msatisfying f(x)̸≤f(y).
Since the underlying Priestley space of Xis profinite, there exists a continuous surjection
e∈Priest (X, A)such that Ais a finite discretely topologized poset, satisfying e(x)̸≤e(y).
We denote the preorder on Xinduced by eby⊑(i.e.x⊑yiffe(x)≤e(y)). We define ⪯by
x⪯yiff∀u, v∈X:uxv⊑uyv,
and denote its corresponding equivalence relation by ≈.
(1) We prove that ⪯is a stable preorder. First we show that ⪯refines ≤: ifx≤y, then
∀u, v∈X:uxv≤uyvsince the multiplication is monotone. Moreover, we have uxv⊑uyv
for all u, v∈X, since ≤is contained in ⊑. It follows that multiplication is ⪯-monotone: if
x⪯yandx′⪯y′, then for all u, v∈Xwe have
u(xx′)v=ux(x′v)⊑uy(x′v) = (uy)x′v⊑(uy)y′v=u(yy′)v,
whence xx′⪯yy′.
(2a) We prove that the equivalence relation ≈ ⊆X×Xis open. The equivalence relation
induced by ⊑is denoted by ≡, that is, x≡yiffx⊑y⊑xiffe(x) =e(y). Note that ≡
is open since it is the preimage of the (open) diagonal of Aunder e×e. Now let m≈n.
By openness of ≡and continuity of the multiplication we obtain for all u, v∈Xopen
neighbourhoods Uu, Uv, Vu,vandWu,vofu, v, m, n , respectively, such that
∀u′∈Uu, v′∈Uv, m′∈Vu,v, n′∈Wu,v:u′m′v′≡u′n′v′. (5.6)
By compactness of Xwe have X×X=S
u,vUu×Uv=Sn
i=1Uui×Uvifor some nandui, vi.
Now set V=Tn
i=1Vui,viandW=Tn
i=1Wui,vi. Then V×Wis an open neighbourhood of
(m, n)satisfying V×W⊆ ≈: for (m′, n′)∈V×Wwe have for all u′, v′∈Xsome iwith
(u′, v′)∈Uui×Uvi. Using (5.6) we have u′m′v′≡u′n′v′, proving m′≈n′.
(2b) We prove that every equivalence class [x]≈is open. For every y∈[x]≈, there exists,
since≈is open by (2a), a basic open U×V⊆ ≈with (x, y)∈U×V. For every y′∈VweEXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 43
have (x, y′)∈U×V⊆ ≈, soVis an open neighbourhood of ythat is contained in [x]≈,
proving that ≈is open.
(3) It follows that the quotient finduced by ⪯has the desired properties: (3a) It is a
homomorphism of ordered monoids by Lemma 5.36, since ⪯is a stable preorder. (3c) The
codomain X/≈is finite and discrete, since equivalence relations with open equivalence classes
are discrete, so X/≈is finite by compactness. (3d) Finally we show that forder-separates
xandy: For the sake of contradiction suppose f(x)≤f(y). By definition we have x⪯y,
implying x= 1x1⊑1y1 =y, a contradiction.
Proposition 5.38. Every Priestley monoid is profinite:
PriestMon ∼=ProfOrdMon .
Proof.For every X∈PriestMon we prove that X∼=limDX, where DXis the canonical
codirected diagram for Xover all finite discretely-topologized ordered monoid quotients of X;
in particular, this shows that Xis profinite.
First note that the limit of a diagram DinPriestMon is formed by taking the limit
L=lim|D|of the underlying diagram | − | · DinStoneMon and equipping it with the
product order. Then all projections are monotone, and this order makes Ltotally order-
disconnected: if (xe)e,(ye)e∈Lwith (xe)e̸≤(ye)ethen there exists by definition of the order
some quotient e:X↠Xewith xe̸≤ye. Hence p−1
e[↑xe]is a clopen upset of Lcontaining
(xe)ebut not (ye)e. This shows that Lis a Priestley monoid, and it is easy to verify that it
satisfies the universal property in PriestMon .
We have to prove that the canonical homomorphism ϕ:X→limDXis an isomorphism
of Priestley monoids, or equivalently, that it is a continuous surjective order-embedding.
Continuity and order-preservation are given since ϕis a morphism in Priest.
That ϕisanorder-embeddingfollowsfromitbeingorder-reflecting: ϕ(x)≤ϕ(y)⇒x≤y.
Bycontrapositionitsufficestoshow x̸≤y⇒ϕ(x)̸≤ϕ(y), buttherightsideoftheimplication
is equivalent to finding an ordered monoid quotient f:X↠Ainto a finite Priestley monoid
with f(x)̸≤f(y). This is precisely the content of Lemma 5.37.
To show that ϕis surjective, we use a general property of codirected limits of compact
Hausdorff spaces [ RZ10, Lemma 1.1.5]: if fi:X↠Xiis a compatible family of surjections
into a codirected diagram Xi, then the induced mapping f:X→limXiis surjective.
By duality we immediately obtain the following result:
Corollary 5.39. Every comonoid is locally finite: Comon ∼=Comon lf.
Definition 5.40. LetXandYbe Priestley monoids. A Priestley relational morphism
X→Yis a total Priestley relation ρ:X→V↓Ysuch that
ρ(x)ρ(x′)⊆ρ(xx′)and 1N∈ρ(1M).
Theorem 5.41. (1)The category of derivation algebras is dually equivalent to the category
of Priestley monoids
Der∼=Comon ≃opPriestMon .
(2)The duality from item (1) extends to Priestley relational morphisms:
RelDer ∼=RelComon ≃opRelPriestMon .
Proof.(1)We assemble all the steps of the (dual) equivalences: The category of profinite
ordered monoids is the Pro-completion of the category of finite ordered monoids [ ACMU21 ,44 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
Prop. 2.10]. Since the category of finite ordered monoids is dual to the category of finite
comonoids (Theorem 5.22), the Pro-completion of the former is dual to the Ind-completion
of the latter. By Proposition 5.35, the latter is equivalent to the category of locally finite
comonoids – but this category is, by Theorem 5.33(2), equivalent to the category of derivation
algebras:
PriestMon ≃Pro(OrdMon f)≃opInd(Comon f)≃Comon lf≃Der.
(2)A Priestley relational morphism from MtoNis precisely a total Priestley relation
ρ:M→V↓Nsuch that the following diagrams commute laxly as indicated.

V↓N×V↓N V↓(N×N) V↓N N V↓N·M
ρ×ρ ρ1M
1N ρ

V↓(·N)≤

Recall that V↓∼=bF∨bU∨forU∨:DL→JSL, so under extended duality ρdualizes
precisely to a relational morphism of comonoids:
U∨ˆM⊗U∨ˆM U∨ˆM 2 U∨ˆM
U∨ˆN⊗U∨ˆN U∨ˆN U∨ˆNU∨(ˆ·M) U∨(ˆ1M)
ˆρ−⊗ˆρ−≤ ˆρ−
U∨(ˆ·M)≤ ˆρ−
U∨(ˆ1N)
Together with Theorem 5.33(3) this extends the duality established in item (1).
Remark 5.42. (1)Theorem 5.41 restricts to a duality between the category profinite
monoids and Stone relational morphisms and the category of boolean derivation algebras
and relational residuation morphisms.
(2)All results of Section 5.4 hold analogously for the extension of the ‘discrete’ duality
between posets (or sets) and algebraic completely distributive lattices (or completely atomic
boolean algebras) along the free-forgetful adjunction between completely distributive lattices
andcomplete join-semilattices . This yields a duality between the category of all (discretely)
ordered monoids and complete, completely distributive (boolean) derivation algebras with
open residuation morphisms. Moreover, this duality also can be extended to relational
morphisms. Its extension to relational operators is treated in Section 6.
6.Duality for the Category of Small Categories
As a final application of the abstract extended duality framework, we derive a concrete
description of Catop, the dual of the category of small categories and functors. This
application emphasizes the versatility of our framework of extending dualities. We instantiate
the parameters of Assumption 3.3 as follows:
D bD
C bC≃op
F bF
≃opU⊣
T⊢bU =CSLVCSLW
CABA Set≃op
P V
≃opUV⊣
P⊢P(6.1)EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 45
Categories. The category CABA is the category of complete atomic boolean algebras
(CABAs): its objects are complete boolean algebras in which every element is the join of all
atoms below it, and the morphisms are the complete lattice homomorphisms, that is, they
preserve all meets and joins. It is well known that CABA ≃opSet: in one direction, the
dual equivalence maps a set Xto its powerset CABA PX, and, in the other direction, a
CABA Bis mapped to the set A(B)of its atoms.
The category CSLW(CSLV) consists of complete join (meet) semilattices with mor-
phisms preserving all joins (meets). Every complete join- or meet-semilattice Xalso has all
meets and joins, respectively, given by
^
detA=_
{x| ∀a∈A:x≤a},_
detA=^
{x| ∀a∈A:x≥a}.
The categories CSLWandCSLVare dual to each other by swapping joins for meets and
taking right, respectively left adjoints of morphisms. This duality is often stated equivalently
asCSLW≃opCSLW, if the duality also reverses the order on objects.
Functors and Monoidal Structure. The functor P:Set→CSLWsending a set to
its free complete join-semilattice is left adjoint to the forgetful functor V:CSLW→Set.
The category CSLWis equipped with the tensor product ⊗Cof complete join-semilattices
(representingW-bilinear maps). This makes Pa strong monoidal left adjoint:
P(X×Y)∼=PX⊗CPY.
The induced monoidal structure for the powerset monad on Setis given by taking products
of subsets:
ˆδ:PX× PY→ P(X×Y),(A, B)7→A×B.
The Kleisli category of Pis the category Relof sets with relations as morphisms. We
denote the lifting of the cartesian structure of SettoRelby¯×: on objects of Relwe have
X¯×Y=X×Y, and the tensor r¯×r′of relations r:X→ PY, r′:X′→ PY′is defined as
ˆδ·(r×r′):X×X′→ PY× PY′→ P(Y×Y′),(x, x′)7→ {(y, y′)|y∈r(x), y′∈r(y)}.
On the dual side, the left adjoint to the forgetful functor UV:CABA →CSLVis also
given by powerset; the unit of this adjunction is given by
ηM:M→ PM, x 7→ {y|y≤x}.
If we respectively equip CABAandCSLVwith coproduct +and tensor product ⊠Cof
complete meet-semilattices as monoidal structures, then the forgetful functor (CABA ,+)→
(CSLV,⊠C)is strong monoidal, analogous to the forgetful functor (DL,+)→(MSL ,⊠)of
Notation 5.1. A straightforward verification shows that these adjunctions are indeed dual to
each other: bV∼=UVandbP∼=P. For details we refer to Bezhanishvili et al. [BCM22].
6.1.Relational Monoids and Small Categories. It is well known that small categories
can be described in an object-free way as partial monoids [ ML98,FJSZ23,SS67] with an
additional localitycondition. For our purposes it will be convenient to describe partial
monoids more generally as monoids in the monoidal category Rel.46 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
Notation 6.1. Given a ternary relation r:X×Y→ PZ, we have the relation
[
·P(r)·ˆδ:PX× PY→ P(X×Y)→ PP Z→ PZ, (A, B)7→[
x∈A,y∈Br(x, y).(6.2)
Abusing notation, we denote the map (6.2)also by r:PX× PY→ PZ. We write r@(x, y)
ifr(x, y)̸=∅, and similarly x r@yifris used as an infix operator. Furthermore, we identify
singleton sets {x} ⊆Xwith their unique inhabitants x∈X.
Definition 6.2. (1)Arelational monoid consists of a carrier set M, a subset E ,→Mof
identities and amultiplication relation ◦:M×M→ PMsuch that the following diagrams
commute in Rel:
M¯×M¯×M M¯×M
M¯×M Mid¯×◦
◦¯×id ◦
◦1¯×M M M¯×1
M¯×M M M¯×M∼=
E¯×id id∼=
id¯×E
◦ ◦
Using Notation 6.1, the diagrams above read
∀x, y, z ∈M: (x◦y)◦z=x◦(y◦z), E ◦x=x=x◦E.
(2)A relational monoid is a partial monoid if◦is single-valued, and it is local[FJSZ23] if it
satisfies
x◦@yandv∈y◦z=⇒x◦@v.
(3)Afunctorial morphism h:(M,◦, E)→(M′,◦, E′)of partial monoids is a pure morphism
of binary JP-operators (that is, P(h)(x◦y) =h(x)◦h(y)) satisfying h(E)⊆E′. The category
of relational monoids and functorial morphisms is denoted by RelMon .
Every monoid is obviously also a relational monoid. A example of a partial monoid that
is not local is given by (P(X),◦,∅),|X| ≥1, with A◦B=A+BifA, Bare disjoint and
A◦B=∅otherwise.
Remark 6.3. (1)The full subcategory of RelMon consisting of local partial monoids is
equivalent to the category of small categories [ML98, FJSZ23, SS67]:
RelMon fun,loc≃Cat.
From right to left, a small category Cis mapped to the relational monoid MorCwith
identities {idC|C∈C}. It is easy to see that MorCis a local partial monoid.
For left to right, one first has to show that in a partial monoid Mevery element f∈M
has unique left and right units el
f, er
f∈E. The equivalence then sends a monoid Mto the
category whose objects are given by the units Eand with morphisms
hom( e, e′) ={f∈M|e=el
f, e′=er
f}.
(2)While the multiplication of the relational monoid corresponding to a small category is
single-valued, that is, it factorizes as
Mor(C)×Mor(C)→Mor(C) +{∅},→ P(Mor( C)),
its set of units can be any element of P(Mor(C)). This is the reason why we work with the
full powerset in our assumptions (6.1) in lieu of the maybe submonad.
Like in the finitary case, relational monoids correspond to (complete) residuation algebras,
so it remains to single out the images of local partial monoids.EXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 47
Definition 6.4. (1)Aresiduation CABA is a boolean residuation algebra Rwhose underly-
ing boolean algebra is a CABA and whose residuals respect arbitrary joins and meets in the
first and second component, respectively, that is, they are of the types
\:R∂⊠CR→Rand /:R⊠CR∂:→R.
(2)A residuation CABA is functional if for all atoms a∈ A(R)theCSLV-morphisms
a\(−):R→Ralso preserve non-empty joins. It is localif it satisfies x?\x?=⊤, where
(−)?∈CSLW(R, R), x 7→ ¬(x\ ⊥).
A residuation CABA is categorical if it has a (not necessarily atomic!) unit e∈Rand is
associative, functional and local.
(3)A (non-unital) morphism from a residuation CABA RtoR′is a complete residuation
algebra morphism h:R→R′, that is, hpreserves all joins and meets and satisfies x′\f(z) =
f(f∗(x′)\z). IfR, R′are unital residuation CABAs, then a morphism is lax unital if it
satisfies e′≤f(e).
We denote the category of residuation CABAs by ResCABA and its subcategory of
categorical residuation CABAs and lax unital morphisms by CatResCABA .
Theorem 6.5. The category of small categories is dually equivalent to the category of
categorical residuation CABAs:
Cat≃opCatResCABA .
Proof.All constructions and results on finiteresiduation algebras from Section 5 hold more
generally for complete andcompletely distributive lattices and complete lattice homomor-
phisms: the constructions and proofs do not inherently rely on finiteness of the lattice
but only on being complete and completely distributive, which is satisfied for every finite
distributive lattice. Elongating the operator duality from Theorem 3.9 (restricted to pure
morphisms as explained in Remark 3.12(1)) by the isomorphism between UV-coalgebras and
residuation algebras from Theorem 5.21 we obtain a duality between binary JP-algebras
with pure operator morphisms and residuation CABAs:
Op2,1
JP(Set)≃opOp1,2
UV≃ResCABA . (6.3)
(Here we abuse notation: the first two categories are the subcategories given by pure
morphisms of the ones in Theorem 3.9.) The dual of a JP-algebra ◦:M×M→ PMis given
by the residuation CABA cM∼=P(M)with left residual
\:P(M)∂⊠CP(M)→ P(M), A ⊠C7→ {b|A◦b⊆C}.
It remains to show that this duality restricts to a duality between the category of local partial
monoids and functorial homomorphisms, and the category of categorical residuation CABAs
and lax unital morphisms.

(1a) The residuation CABA cMis functional iff its UV-coalgebra structure preserves non-
empty joins (Lemma 5.16). The discrete version of Corollary 4.7 states that a UW-operator
preserves non-empty meets iff its dual relation is a partial map; by order-duality a UV-
operator preserves non-empty joins iff its dual relation is a partial map. Combining these48 F. LENKE, H. URBAT, AND S. MILIUS
two equivalences we get that the residuation CABA cMis functional if its dual relation

A?=¬(A\ ⊥) ={n| ¬(A◦n⊆ ∅)}={n|A◦@n}={n| ∃m∈A:m◦@n}.(6.4)
In particular, on atoms m∈cMmembership in m?simplifies to the condition
n∈m?⇐⇒ m◦@n. (6.5)
We rewrite the locality condition using the adjunction B◦(−)⊣B\(−):
A?\A?=M⇐⇒ M⊆A?\A?⇐⇒ A?◦M⊆A?, (6.6)
where ◦:cM⊗CcM→cMis the UW-algebra structure on cMcorresponding to the extension
PM× PM→ PMof the partial monoid multiplication.
We start with the direction that if cMsatisfies (6.6), then Mis local: For this, let
x, y∈Msuch that x◦@yandv∈y◦z. We have to show that x◦@v. We first apply (6.5)to
x◦@yto obtain y∈x?. Monotonicity of ◦in both arguments then yields the first inclusion
below and (6.6) the second one:
v∈y◦z⊆x?◦M⊆x?.
But by (6.5) this means that x◦@v, as required.
For the other direction, we prove that if Mis local, then cMis local. By (6.6)it suffices
to prove ∀A∈cM:A?◦M⊆A?. Let v∈A?◦M. Then there exist y∈A?,z∈Msuch that
v∈y◦z. Since y∈A?, there exists, by (6.4), some x∈Awith x◦@y. Locality of Mnow
implies that x◦@v, sov∈A?as required using (6.4) again.
(2)Finally, we show that the duality in (6.3)restricts on morphisms as claimed. Let
f:M→M′be a pure morphism of JP-algebras with dual morphism h=f−1:cM′→cMof
residuation CABAs. We have to show that fis functorial iff his lax unital: By (1b) the
unitEof a partial monoid Mdualizes to the residual unit E∈cM. Now fis a functorial
morphism of partial monoids iff f[E]⊆E′iffE⊆f−1[E′] =h(E′)iffhis lax unital.
7.Conclusion and Future Work
We have presented an abstract approach to extending Stone-type dualities based on adjunc-
tions between monoidal categories and instantiated it to recover classical extended Stone and
Priestley duality, along with a generalization of it to relational morphisms. Guided by these
foundations, we investigated residuation and derivation algebras, leading to a new duality for
Priestley monoids, and extended this duality to include relational morphisms. In addition,
we derived a new dual characterization of the category of small categories.
Relational morphisms are an important tool in algebraic language theory, notably for
charaterizing language operations algebraically. For instance, aperiodic relational morphismsEXTENDED STONE DUALITY VIA MONOIDAL ADJUNCTIONS 49
aretightlyconnectedtotheconcatenationproductandthestaroperationonregularlanguages.
In future work, we intend to apply the new duality-theoretic insights on relational morphisms
to illuminate such connections, much in the spirit of the duality-theoretic perspective of
Eilenberg’s Variety Theorem by Gehrke et al. [GGP08].
Another goal is to apply our abstract duality framework beyond classical Stone and
Priestley dualities. Specifically, we aim to develop an extended duality theory for the recently
developed nominal Stone duality [ BMU23], which would enable a generalization of our
present results on residuation algebras to the nominal setting and uncover new results about
data languages.
A conceptually rather different dual characterization of the category of profinite monoids
and continuous monoid morphisms in terms of semi-Galois categories has been provided by
Uramoto [ Ura16]. Extending this result to relational morphisms, similar to our Theorem 5.41,
is another interesting point for future work.
Potential applications of our abstract approach to extended Stone duality are not limited
to algebraic language theory. In Section 4.3 we used the compositionality of extended (Stone)
duality to recover results from modal correspondence theory in a purely algebraic fashion,
suggesting that extended Stone duality could serve as a bridge between algebraic modal logic
and modal correspondence theory. In future work we will investigate the expressiveness of
this categorical version of correspondence theory, that is, study which relational properties
can be captured by inequations of operators. Applying this approach to more complex modal
axioms that, e.g., involve negation or implication or combine multiple modalities, can be
expected to be non-trivial.
Our applications so far were based on Stone and Priestley duality, but the general
framework of abstract extended duality applies far beyond this setting. For instance, Furber
and Jacobs [ FJ15] showed how to extend the duality between C∗-algebras and compact
Hausdorff spaces (‘Gelfand duality’) to a probabilistic version (‘probabilistic Gelfand duality’)
which emerges by employing a weaker notion of morphism between C∗-algebras and by
replacing the category of compact Hausdorff spaces by the Kleisli category of the Radon
monad. This result seems to fit perfectly into our approach of extending dualities. A thorough
instantiation of the results from [ FJ15] to our framework could not only place these results
in a larger categorical context, but also uncover new results in probabilistic duality theory.
