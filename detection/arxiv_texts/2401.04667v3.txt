Abstract
This paper investigates the estimation of the interaction f unction for a class
of McKean-Vlasov stochastic diﬀerential equations. The es timation is based on
observations of the associated particle system at time T, considering the scenario
where both the time horizon Tand the number of particles Ntend to inﬁnity.
Our proposed method recovers polynomial rates of convergen ce for the resulting
estimator. This is achieved under the assumption of exponen tially decaying tails
for the interaction function. Additionally, we conduct a th orough analysis of the
transform of the associated invariant density as a complex f unction, providing
essential insights for our main results..

11 Introduction
The foundation of stochastic systems involving interacting particle s and the devel-
opment of nonlinear Markov processes, initially introduced by McKea n in the 1960s
[42], can be traced back to their roots in statistical physics, particula rly within the
domain of plasma physics. Over subsequent decades, the signiﬁcan ce of these systems
in probability theory has steadily grown. This area has witnessed the development of
fundamental probabilistic tools, including propagation of chaos, ge ometric inequali-
ties, and concentration inequalities. Pioneering contributions from researchers such as
M´ el´ eard [ 43], Malrieu [ 40], Cattiaux et al. [ 13], and Sznitman [ 9] have played a crucial
role in shaping this ﬁeld.
However, formulating a modern statistical inference program for these systems
remained challenging until the early 2000s, with few exceptions, suc h as Kasonga’s
early paper [ 36]. Several factors contributed to this challenge. Firstly, the adva nced
probabilistic tools required for estimation were still under developme nt. Secondly, the
microscopic particle systems originating from statistical physics we re not naturally
observable, making the motivation for statistical inference less ap parent. This situa-
tion began to change around the 2010s with the widespread adoptio n of these models
in various ﬁelds where data became observable and collectable. Applic ations expanded
into diverse ﬁelds, including the social sciences (e.g., opinion dynamics [14] and coop-
erative behaviors [ 10]), mathematical biology (e.g., structured models in population
dynamics [ 44] and neuroscience [ 3]), and ﬁnance (e.g., the study of systemic risk [ 23]
and smile calibration [ 29]). Mean-ﬁeld games have emerged as a new frontier for sta-
tistical developments, as evident in references [ 12,20,28]. This transition has led to
a growing need for a systematic statistical inference program, wh ich constitutes the
primary focus of this paper. Recently, this interest has manifeste d in two primary
directions. On one front, statistical investigations are rooted in t he direct observation
of large interacting particle systems, as evidenced in works [ 2,15,16,18,19,47]. On
the other front, statistical inference revolves around the obse rvation of the mean-ﬁeld
limit, the McKean-Vlasovprocess,asexempliﬁed in [ 24,25,51]. Concerningstationary
McKean-Vlasov SDEs, the literature is relatively sparse. To the bes t of our knowl-
edge, only a handful of references exist, including [ 48] and [26], which focus on the
special McKean-Vlasov model without a potential term. In [ 27], a more general model
is explored.
This paper focuses on statistical inference for an interacting par ticle system
described by the following stochastic diﬀerential equation:

is to estimate the interaction function W′based on observations X1,N

Tof the
2particles, which are solutions of the system ( 1). Our approach hinges on the analysis
of the associated inverse problem concerning the underlying statio nary Fokker-Planck
equation,relyingon variousresultsrelated tothe probabilisticprop ertiesofthe model.
Our research is closely connected to a recent study [ 5] that discusses estimation
of the interaction function with a speciﬁc semiparametric structur e. The authors in
[5] develop an estimation procedure, demonstrating convergence r ates that critically
depend on the tail behavior of the nonparametric part of the inter action function W.
Speciﬁcally, assuming a polynomial decay of the tails, they establish lo garithmic con-
vergencerates,provento be optimal in that context. This natur ally raisesthe question
of whether polynomial rates can be achieved under a diﬀerent set o f conditions. Our
paper aims to address this question, and our key ﬁnding is that, by a ssuming exponen-
tial decay of the interaction function W, we can introduce an estimator that achieves
polynomial convergence rates, as demonstrated in Theorem 7.
Compared to the framework proposed in [ 5], our model features some distinctions.
The smoothness of the conﬁnement potential Vemerges as a crucial factor inﬂu-
encing the achieved convergence rate. Additionally, the regularity of the invariant
densityπof the associated McKean-Vlasov equation and the analysis of its Fo urier
transform F(π) are vital for establishing the asymptotic properties of our estima tor.
Notably, a lower bound on F(π) is required, presenting one of the primary challenges
in our paper. We address this challenge using Hadamard factorizatio n, leading to the
desired lower bound under mild assumptions on the model. Furthermo re, we provide
an example demonstrating how a non-smooth conﬁnement potentia lVresults in
the Fourier transform F(π) exhibiting a polynomial decay. As another interesting
situation, we consider the case of non-smooth potential Wand show that even in
this case the Fourier transform of πdecays exponentially fast. Further technical
tools include the extension of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein dual the orem to functions
lacking Lipschitz continuity, presented in Theorem 3, and an extension of the uni-
form propagation of chaos in the L2p-norm without convexity assumption for W, as
demonstrated in Proposition 4.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the model assump-
tions. This section also oﬀers a concise overview of interacting part icle systems, and
the relevant tools about Fourier and Laplace transforms. Crucially , we present key
probabilistic results that lay the groundwork for our main ﬁndings. S ection3is ded-
icated to formulating our primary statistical problem and the assoc iated estimation
procedure. Additionally, we establish upper bounds on the L2risk of the proposed
drift estimator. The proof of our main results is provided in Section 4, where we delve
into the detailed veriﬁcation of our key ﬁndings. Finally, in Section 5, we explore the
suﬃcient conditions necessary to ensure that the transforms sa tisfy the requirements
for our main results. All remaining proofs are collected in Section 6.
Notation
All random variables and stochastic processes are deﬁned on a ﬁlte red probability
space (Ω ,F,(Ft)t≥0,P). Throughout the paper, we use the symbol cto represent
positive constants, although these constants may vary from one line to another. For
3any function f:R→R, we denote its supremum as ∝⌊ard⌊lf∝⌊ard⌊l∞:= supy∈R|f(y)|. The
notation xn/lessorsimilarynsigniﬁes the existence of a constant c >0, independent of n, such
thatxn≤cyn. The derivativesofa function fare denoted as f′,f′′,...,orf(k),k≥1.
We useCk(R) to denote the space of ktimes continuously diﬀerentiable functions. For
a complex number z∈C, we denote its complex conjugate, real part, and imaginary
part asz, Re(z), and Im( z), respectively. For a∈R, we use the notation
La:={y+ıa:y∈R}.
2 Model and assumptions
We start our analysis by introducing a set of assumptions on the con ﬁnement poten-
tialVand the interaction potential W. It will become evident that the smoothness of
Vplays a pivotal role in our asymptotic analysis. Our investigation enco mpasses two
distinct scenarios: (a) The conﬁnement potential of inﬁnite smoot hness takes the form
V(x) =αx2/2 for a positive constant α, (b) The conﬁnement potential is expressed
asV(x) =αx2/2 +/tildewideV(x), where α >0 and/tildewideVis a known function characterized
by non-smooth features, as elucidated below. We assume that VandWsatisfy the
following hypothesis:
Assumption 1. The potentials W:R→RandV:R→Rare non-negative functions
such that
•The interaction potential W∈C2(R)is even with bounded derivatives W′∈L1(R)
andW′′such that infx∈RW′′(x) =−CWfor some CW>0.
•The conﬁnement potential Vis given by
V(x) =α
2x2+/tildewideV(x), α+ inf
x∈R/tildewideV′′(x) =CV>0
whereCVandCWsatisfy the relation CV−CW>0./tildewideVis given by either
A1./tildewideV= 0, or
A2./tildewideVis even, has polynomial growth and there exists J∈N, J≥2such that/tildewideV∈
CJ(R)and/tildewideV∝\e}atio\slash∈CJ+1(R). Furthermore, for each 2≤j≤J,supx∈R|/tildewideV(j)(x)|=
˜cj<∞.
Additionally, the initial distribution admits a density µ0(dx) =µ0(x)dxwhich satisﬁes
/integraldisplay
Rexp(cx)µ0(x)dx <∞,∀c∈R,/integraldisplay
Rlog(µ0(x))µ0(x)dx <∞.(2)
Discussion
(i) We would like to emphasize that we do not assume convexity of the in teraction
potential W, as is commonly done in most works. Instead, our assumption is that
W′′is bounded below by a constant −CW<0. While the geometric convergence
of the distribution of the system ( 1) to the invariant distribution for t→ ∞now
4follows from [ 11, Theorem 2.1], Proposition 4establishes a uniform (in time) prop-
agation of chaos under the above assumptions. Note also that A1 c an be seen as a
special case of A2, where J=∞.
(ii) The presence of the quadratic term in the conﬁnement potentia lVis required to
control the decay of the invariant density (cf. Lemma 1). A similar semi-parametric
assumption has been considered in [ 5].
(iii) In the scenario of a non-smooth conﬁnement potential /tildewideVas described in A2, we
obtainanexplicitpolynomiallowerboundonthedecayofthecharact eristicfunction
of the invariant density (cf. Example 2). This is vital for the statistical analysis.

The invariant density can be upper and lower bounded under our ass umptions,
according to the following lemma. Its proof can be found in Section 6.
5Lemma 1. Suppose that Assumption 1 holds true. Then, for any x∈R, there exist
two constants c1, c2>0such that
c1exp(−/tildewideCx2)≤π(x)≤c2exp(−CVx2),
with/tildewideC:=α+˜c2andCVand˜c2are as in Assumption 1 . Furthermore, it holds that
|π(n)(x)| ≤c(1+|x|)nexp(−CVx2),0≤n≤J.
A crucial tool in our estimation procedure consists in the result whic h combines uni-
form in time propagation of chaos for ( 1) with convergence to the equilibrium of (3).
In order to state it we start by introducing the Wasserstein metric . TheWasserstein

where the inﬁmum is taken over all the possible couplings ( X,Y) of random variables
XandYwith respective laws µandν.
The following result combines Point (iv) of Theorem 2.1 in [ 11] with Theorem
5.1 in [41] or Theorem 3.1 in [ 13], adapted to the current framework, see also our
Proposition 4 below.

whereλ=CV−CW>0, andCVandCWhave been introduced in Assumption 1 .
The aforementioned bound asserts that the invariant distribution Π of the mean ﬁeld
equation can be accurately approximated by the empirical measure ΠN,T, while pro-
viding an associated error bound for this approximation. In the upc oming estimation
procedure all convergence rates will be measured in terms of NT. In the following,
we will present and prove a similar result, but from a dual perspectiv e, involving the
6Laplace transforms of Π N,Tand Π. We opt to replace the use of Fourier transform, as
seen in [5], with the Laplace transform. This choice is made with a similar intent as
the authors of [ 4], allowing for greater ﬂexibility and the inclusion of diverse scenarios.
Before we proceed further, let us now introduce some notation an d properties con-
cerning the Laplace transform. For any locally integrable function φ, we deﬁne the
bilateral Laplace transform as follows:
/hatwideφ(z) :=/integraldisplay
Rφ(t)exp(−zt)dt. (6)
Moreover, we deﬁne the Fourier transform on Cas follows:
F(φ(z)) =/integraldisplay
Rφ(z)exp(izt)dt.
The Laplace transform /hatwideφ(z) is an analytic function within the convergenceregion Σ φ,
which typically takes the form of a vertical strip in the complex plane:
Σφ:=/braceleftBig
z∈C:x−
φ≤Re(z)≤x+
φ/bracerightBig
for some x−
φ,x+
φsuch that −∞< x−
φ≤x+
φ<∞. The convergence region Σ φ
can degenerate to a vertical line in the complex plane, in such case it is Σφ:=
{z∈C: Re(z) =xφ}, withxφ∈R. Ifφis a probability density, then the imaginary
axis always belongs to the convergence region Σ φ. In this case the Fourier transform
ofφ
/hatwideφ(−ıy) =F(φ)(y) :=/integraldisplay
Rφ(t)exp(ıyt)dt, y ∈R,
is the characteristic function of φ. This degenerate case pertains to distributions
whose characteristic function lacks the ability to be analytically exte nded to a strip
surrounding the imaginary axis in the complex plane.
We are now ready to state a propagation of chaos type result for t he Fourier
transforms that is reminiscent of Theorem 2by means of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein
theorem. In particular, we can demonstrate that the transform of Π can also be eﬀec-
tively approximated by the transform of the empirical measure Π N,T. The proof can
be found in Section 4.
Theorem 3. UnderAssumption 1 , there exists a constant c >0such that, for any
z∈ L±a,
E[|F(Π)(z)−F(ΠN,T)(z)|2]≤c|z|2N−1
T.
Remark 1. Note that for z∈R, this theorem is a direct implication of the
Kantorovich-Rubinstein dual formulation, applicable to 1-Lipschitz functions. How-
ever, when dealing with z∈ L±a, the function exp( iz) no longer possesses Lipschitz
continuity, thereby rendering the use of the Kantorovich-Rubins tein dual formulation
unfeasible. This motivates us to establish this analogous formulation .
7Some crucial results will be instrumental in the derivation of the the orem above.
Speciﬁcally, we present an extension of the propagation of chaos t heorem, as stated in
Proposition 4below, in the L2pnorm, for p≥1. For the detailed proof of this result,
we refer to Section 6.

3 Statistical Framework and Main Results
3.1 The Estimation Procedure
Supposeweobservethedata X1,N
T,...,XN,N
Tintheasymptoticframeworkwhereboth
NandTtend towards inﬁnity. Our goal is to estimate the interaction funct ionW′.
In particular, we will propose an estimator W′
N,Tand study its performance by con-
sidering the associated mean integrated squared error, aiming to a chieve polynomial
convergence rates.
The estimation procedure is semiparametric in the sense that it cons ists of four
diﬀerent steps, involving both parameter estimation and nonparam etric estimation
techniques.
1. The ﬁrst step consists in the estimation of the derivative of the lo g-density which
we denote as l(y):
l(y) := (log π)′(y) =π′(y)
π(y), y∈R.
This will be achieved by the introduction of kernel estimators for bo thπandπ′.
LetKbe a smooth kernel of order m≥2, that is
/integraldisplay
RK(x)dx= 1,/integraldisplay
RxjK(x)dx= 0, j= 0,...,m−1,/integraldisplay
RxmK(x)dx∝\e}atio\slash= 0.
It is worth noting the choice of the kernel order, denoted by m, is ﬂexible and
can be determined by the statistician. As we will see later on, the cho ice ofmis
determined by the regularity of V: a smooth conﬁnement potential allows us to
choose an arbitrary m∈N. On the other hand, if Vis non-smooth as described
inAssumption 1 , A2, we need to additionally assume that m≤J. Indeed, this
is a standard restriction on the order of the kernel when estimatin g non-smooth
functions. Let us also introduce the bandwidths hi:=hi,N,T,i= 0,1, which satisfy
hi→0 forN,Tgoing to ∞and the notation Kh(x) =1
hK(x
h). Then, we can deﬁne
8the kernel estimators πN,Tandπ′
N,Tforπandπ′, respectively, as below:
πN,T(y) :=1
NN/summationdisplay
i=1Kh0(y−Xi,N
T), π′
N,T(y) :=1
Nh1N/summationdisplay
i=1K′
h1(y−Xi,N
T), y∈R.
An estimator for the derivative of the log-density l(y) is then given by
lN,T(y) :=π′
N,T(y)
πN,T(y)1{πN,T(y)>δ},
whereδ=δN,T→0 asN,T→ ∞.
2. In the second step, we estimate the parameter α >0 appearing in the conﬁnement
potential. This is based on the identity
l(y) =−2αy−2/tildewideV′(y)−W′⋆π(y)
and on a contrast function method. Indeed, since W′∈L1(R), we know that
|W′⋆π(y)| →0 as|y| → ∞, which allows us to construct a minimal contrast
estimator for α. In particular, for any ǫ∈(0,1) arbitrarily small, we can introduce
an integrable weight function wwith support on [ ǫ,1] and a parameter U=UN,T,
which satisﬁes U→ ∞forN,T→ ∞. Then, we can deﬁne the estimator αN,Tfor
αas
αN,T:= argmin

R/parenleftBig
lN,T(y)+2αy+2/tildewideV′(y)/parenrightBig2
wU(y)dy,
wherewU(·) := (1/U)w(·/U).
3. Using the results in the previous step we can construct an estima tor ΨN,Tof Ψ :=
−W′⋆ π. Indeed, given the estimators lN,TandαN,Tconstructed above, we can
deﬁne
ΨN,T(y) :=/parenleftBig
lN,T(y)+2αN,Ty+2/tildewideV′(y)/parenrightBig
1{|y|≤ǫU}, y∈R.
4. The last step consists in applying the deconvolution and the invers e Laplace trans-
form to obtain an estimator for W′. Note that because we want to consider
values of F(Π) in the strip of analyticity (e.g. to escape zeros of F(Π)), we can
not use the standard regularization techniques of deconvolution p roblems consist-
ing of cutting oﬀ the estimates outside bounded intervals on real line , see [54].
Instead, we are going to employ Tikhonov-type regularization. Mor e speciﬁcally,
for some a≥0, choose a sequence of entire functions ρN,Tsuch that for z∈ L±a,
|F(ΠN,T)(z)+ρN,T(z)| ≥εN,T>0, where εN,T→0 forN,T→ ∞. Then, we
deﬁne the estimator W′
N,Tvia
F/parenleftbig
W′
N,T/parenrightbig
(z) :=−F(ΨN,T)(z)
F(ΠN,T)(z)+ρN,T(z). (7)
9Observe that the right hand side is well-deﬁned since Ψ N,T∈L1(R)∩L2(R).
Additionally, for all z∈ L±a,|F(W′
N,T)(z)| ≤ε−1
N,T|F(ΨN,T)(z)|, such that W′
N,T,
as the inverse Fourier transform of the right hand side, is well-deﬁn ed.
Remark 2. The use of Tikhonov-type regularization in ( 7), instead of more common
hard-thresholding-type regularizations in deconvolution problems , is motivated by the
fact that we want to consider the estimate F/parenleftbig
W′
N,T/parenrightbig
on the complex plane. This,
in turn, makes it possible to weaken our assumptions on the zeros of F(Π) and, in
particular, allows for zeros on the real line. For example, the Fourie r transform of the
densityπ(x)∝exp(−/summationtextp
k=1ckx2k) withck>0 corresponding to polynomial potential
W, has only real zeros for all natural p >1 (see Theorem 20 in [ 17]) and hence it is
reasonable to consider integration contours Lawitha >0 in this situation. We refer
to [4] for a similar approach, where the problem of singularities in the deco nvolution
estimates was overcome by considering general integration conto urs in the complex
plane when computing the inverse Fourier transform. In fact, Tikh onov regularization,
also known as ridge regularization, is a commonly used technique to st abilize the
solution of inverse problems, including deconvolution problems, see [ 7].
It is natural to draw a comparison between our proposed estimatio n approach with
the one presented in [ 5], particularly in scenarios where the interacting drift exhibits
polynomialtails.Althoughtheoverallstepsintheestimationproces ssharesimilarities,
our context introduces several novel considerations.
Our estimation procedure can be divided into two parts, depending o n whether
we are addressing the ﬁrst case with inﬁnite smoothness, where /tildewideV= 0, or the less
smooth case where /tildewideVadheres to condition A2. The model distinction arises from the
absence of the potential function V(x) in [5]. Instead, the interaction potential in [ 5]
comprises two components: the potential, encompassing trigonom etricand polynomial
functions, and the non-parametric component of W. Despite this diﬀerence, it does
not signiﬁcantly impact the estimation procedure. The parametric c omponent in [ 5]
playsarolesimilarto the conﬁnementpotential in ourcontext,and b oth areestimated
through a contrast function, yielding comparable results in Steps 1 and 2 for both
cases.
The deviation becomes evident in Step 3, where the constraint on ex ponential
tails ofW′results in polynomial convergence rates (see Theorem 6), a contrast to the
logarithmic convergence rates for Ψ in [ 5] due to polynomial tails of W′.
The divergence continues into the fourth and ﬁnal step, where th e estimation pro-
cedure takes on entirely diﬀerent forms. The primary challenge lies in analyzing the
joint decay of the transforms of W′andπ, introducing the condition
/integraldisplay
La/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleF(W′)(z)
F(Π)(z)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2
dz <∞.
Analyzing such a condition proves to be a complex task. Notably, the analysis hinges
on studying the zeros of the transform of π, leading us to use the Laplace transform
instead of the Fourier transform. It is worth noting that selecting a= 0 inLaallows
10obtaining the Fourier transform from the Laplace transform. A co mprehensive expla-
nation regarding the fulﬁllment of the mentioned constraint can be f ound in Section
5.
3.2 Main Results: Convergence Rates
Let us start with the ﬁrst step, which consists in the estimation of l. We remark again
that the order of the kernel can be chosen arbitrarily in the case o f/tildewideV= 0, whereas
for/tildewideVas inAssumption 1 , A2, we require the condition m≤J. In the sequel the
bandwidth h0forπN,Tis chosen as
h0:=N−1
2(m+1)
T. (8)
Similarly, for the estimation of πN,Twe choose
h1:=N−1
2(m+2)
T. (9)
Finally, the threshold parameter is chosen as
δ:=c1
2exp(−/tildewideCU2), (10)
wherec1,/tildewideCare the constants appearing in Lemma 1. We remark that the choice of
h0andh1is the same as in [ 5] while the choice of δis due to our lower bound on πas
presented in Lemma 1.

We now proceed to estimate αin Step 2, employing the estimator αN,T. In our current
context, this step is less challenging than it was in the previous work c ited as [5],
thanks to the speciﬁc model under consideration. In particular, t he estimation of α
essentially involves simplifying Step 2 from [ 5] to the scalar case, where an additional
potential/tildewideVhas been introduced. However, this potential is already known, an d it can
be chosen in a way such that it does not contribute to the converge nce rate at this
stage of the analysis.

11The dependence of the convergence rate for Ψ N,Ton the tail behavior of the function
W′is evident in Theorem 6. In particular, when the tails of W′exhibit exponen-
tial decay, the subsequent corollary, which directly follows from th e previous result,
provides a precise bound.
Corollary 1. In the setting of previous theorem, let p > CVand assume that

Remark 3. One might question why the convergence rate above depends on th e aux-
iliary parameter ǫ∈(0,1) introduced in the second step of our estimation procedure.
By following the proof of Theorem 6, it is easy to verify that when the value of αis
known and does not require pre-estimation, the results still hold wit hǫ= 1. However,
when estimating the parameter α, we lose the option of setting ǫ= 1 and can only use
ǫ∈(0,1), which slightly aﬀects our convergence rate. The optimal choice is to take ǫ
as close to 1 as possible, resulting in a convergence rate γequal to
m
2(m+2)1
1+4/tildewideC
CV−˜ǫ
for any arbitrarily small ˜ ǫ.
The estimation of Ψ leads us to the estimation of W′as stated in the following
theorem. In this context, an assumption regarding the decay of t he transforms of π
andW′will be crucial.
Assumption 2. Recall that La={y+ıa:y∈R}for some a≥0. There exists an
a≥0such that/integraldisplay

F(Π)(z)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2
dz <∞. (16)
We will further analyze this assumption in Section 5 . In such section, we will employ
tools from complex analysis to establish a lower bound on F(Π)(z), allowing us to
verify that Assumption 2 holds true in speciﬁc situations. Additionally, at the conclu-
sion of Section 5, we provide an example illustrating how a non-smooth conﬁnement
potential implies polynomial decay in the transform of the invariant d ensity. This
12example assists us in verifying the validity of Assumption 2 as mentioned earlier.

From a quick look at Theorem 7, it is easy to see that it provides the ﬁnal convergence
rate for the estimation of W′.

2
T. Thanks to Hadamard representation we will
see in Section 5we can obtain such result if F(Π)(z) does not have zeros on the real
line (see Theorem 12below). In Theorem 7, we consider a more general case, where
we allow the function F(Π)(z) to have real zeros. The crucial condition is indeed that
there exists at least one line parallel to the real axis on which such fu nction does not
have any zeros. Let us stress that this condition is much weaker th en one requiring no
zeros ofF(Π)(z) on the real axis (¯ a= 0) since there is a large class of densities with
Fourier transforms vanishing only on the real line, see, e.g. [ 8]. We refer to Section 5
for more details.
Remark 5. Even when Assumption 2 holds for ¯ a∝\e}atio\slash= 0, the observed convergence
rate, as determined in the aforementioned theorem, remains polyn omial. This out-
come arises from the dominance of the polynomial term over the exp onential term in
Theorem 7.
Remark 6. Itisimportanttohighlightthatthe convergencerateoutlinedinThe orem
7is contingent upon the smoothness of the conﬁnement potential /tildewideV. Speciﬁcally, in
the scenario of smooth potentials, we have the ﬂexibility to set the p arameter mto
be arbitrarily large. Additionally, it’s noteworthy to mention that ǫ∈(0,1) with the
optimal choice being in close proximity to 1. This choice results in γbeing close to
1/(2(1+4/tildewideC/CV)).
In contrast, when dealing with a conﬁnement potential of smoothn essJ, we
encounter the constraint m≤J. In this case, the optimal choice is to set m=J,
leading to γbeing close to J/(2(J+2)(1+4/tildewideC/CV)).
3.3 A Lower Bound
In this section, we establish a lower bound for our statistical proble m in the non-
smooth setting. To this end, we consider a simpliﬁed statistical mode l described as
13follows:
X1,...,X Nare i.i.d. ∼π, π(x) =1
Zπexp(−2V(x)−W ⋆π(x)).
We denote the corresponding law by P⊗N
V,W. We assume that the conﬁnement potential
Vis ﬁxed and takes the form V(x) =αx2/2+/tildewideV(x), where α >0 is a known constant,
and/tildewideVsatisﬁes Assumption A2. Next, we introduce the functional class Ar,p,J,r=

forp >0. We remark that the space Ar,p,Jis non-empty. In particular, existence of
conﬁnement potential V, which guarantees the validity of the last condition on F(π),
is shown in Example 2. The main result of this section is the following statement.

We recall that the convergencerate ofour estimator introduced in the previoussection
is given by N−γ/2(up to log terms) with
γ=J
2(J+2)(1+4/tildewideC/CV).
While the latter does not match the lower bound of Theorem 8, the rate N−γ/2is
getting close to N−1/4for large JandCV.
4 Proof of the Main Results
Let us introduce some notation and properties of the Laplace tran sform, as deﬁned in
(6), that will be useful in the following section. The inverse Laplace tra nsform is given
by the following formula

Moreover, the following identities will prove to be useful. Let φbe a locally integrable

such that E[exp(tZ)]≤exp(K2t2/2) for all t∈R. For suﬃcient conditions ensuring

i=1δi(z),
where
δ1(z) =|F(Π)(z)−F(ΠT)(z)|2, δ 2(z) =E/bracketleftBig

let us deal with δ1(z). We introduce a random vector ( XT,X) withL(XT) =ΠT,
L(X) = Π which attains E[|XT−X|2] =W2
2(ΠT,Π). Then, using again ( 18), it is
δ1(z)1

2|z|E[|XT−X|(exp(−aXT)+exp(−aX))]
Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we obtain
E[|XT−X|(exp(−aXT)+exp(−aX))]/lessorsimilarW2(ΠT,Π)
since the moments and the exponential moments of XT,Xare uniformly in Tﬁnite
by Lemma 9and the fact that L(X) = Π is the invariant law of the McKean-
Vlasov stochastic diﬀerential equation. Theorem 1.4 in [ 41] ensures that there exist
two constants candλ:=CV−CW>0 such that
W2(ΠT,Π)≤cexp(−λT).
It yields that
δ1(z)/lessorsimilar|z|2exp(−2λT). (21)

Our reasoning easily extends to z∈ L−a, thereby concluding the proof of the theorem.
174.2 Proof of Proposition 5
The proof of Proposition 5follows closely the proof of Proposition 4.1 in [ 5]. Recall
thatlN,T(x) is a kernel estimator of
l(x) =π′(x)
π(x)=−2V′(x)−W′⋆π(x). (22)
Let us decompose its error into the sum
|lN,T(x)−l(x)|=|l(x)|1{πN,T(x)≤δ}+r(x) (23)
where
r(x) :=|lN,T(x)−l(x)|1{πN,T(x)>δ}
≤δ−1/parenleftbig
|π′
N,T(x)−π′(x)|+|l(x)||πN,T(x)−π(x)|/parenrightbig
. (24)
Under our assumptions, we have that |V′(x)| ≤c(1 +|x|+|/tildewideV′(x)|)≤c(1 +|x|),
where we have used that /tildewideV′(0) = 0 and /tildewideV′′is bounded. Moreover, |W′⋆ π(x)| ≤
∝⌊ard⌊lW′∝⌊ard⌊l∞∝⌊ard⌊lπ∝⌊ard⌊l1=∝⌊ard⌊lW′∝⌊ard⌊l∞<∞, which imply
sup
|x|≤U|l(x)|/lessorsimilarU.
Next, Lemma 1gives the lower bound π(x)≥c1exp(−/tildewideC|x|2), which in turn implies
π(x)≥2δfor all|x| ≤U. It follows that for all |x| ≤U,
P(πN,T(x)≤δ) =P(π(x)−πN,T(x)≥π(x)−δ)
≤P(∝⌊ard⌊lπ−πN,T∝⌊ard⌊l∞≥δ)≤δ−2E/bracketleftbig

.
Finally, consider
πN,T(x)−π(x) =r0(x)+r1(x)
with
r0(x) =Kh0⋆(ΠN,T(x)−Π)(x), r1(x) =Kh0⋆Π(x)−π(x),
where recall Kh0(x) =h−1
0K(h−1
0x) is a scaled kernel. We get
|r0(x)| ≤ch−1
0W1(ΠN,T,Π)
by applying the Kantorovich-Rubinstein theorem, moreover, E[W2
1(ΠN,T,Π)]≤cN−1

because of Theorem 2. After substitution, we have that
r1(x) =/integraldisplay
R(π(x+h0y)−π(x))K(y)dy,

k!(yh0)k+π(m)(x+τyh0)

for some 0 ≤τ≤1. Recall that Khas order m. Moreover, the bound in Lemma 1
ensures that |π(m)(x)| ≤c, hence,
|r1(x)| ≤chm

LetLa:={y+ıa:y∈R}for some a≥0. Assume Re( F(Π)(s))>0 for all
s∈ La. Recall that we deﬁned a sequence of entire functions ρN,T(s) :=F(Π)(s)−
F(ΠN,T)(s)+εN,T,s∈C, for some εN,T>0. Note that for all s∈ La
|F(ΠN,T)(s)+ρN,T(s)|=|F(Π)(s)+εN,T| ≥εN,T>0 (31)

4.6 Proof of Theorem 8
We will apply the two hypotheses method described in [ 52, Theorem 2.2]. For this
purpose we introduce functions
f0(x) :=ı√
2πexp/parenleftbigg
−x2
2/parenrightbigg
(exp(ıx)−exp(−ıx)),
fδ,m(x) :=ıδ√
2πexp/parenleftbigg
−x2
2/parenrightbigg
(exp(ımx)−exp(−ımx)).
The quantities δ→0 andm→ ∞will be chosen later. Note that both functions are
real-valued and odd. We set
W′
0(x) :=f0(x) and W′
1(x) :=f0(x)+fδ,m(x).
Consequently, the interaction potentials W0andW1are even functions. We ﬁx the
same conﬁnement potential Vin both cases as suggested in Section 3.3. Finally, we
associate the density function πk(resp. probability measure Pk) with the pair ( V,Wk)
fork= 0,1.
First, we check that W0,W1∈ Ar,p,Jfor some ( p,r) under appropriate conditions
on parameters ( ρ,m). For this purpose we set
δ=N−1/4andm=cδ−1
J+2, (38)
for some constant c >0. We obtain that
f′
0(x) =ı√

(x(exp(−ımx)−exp(ımx))+ım(exp(ımx)+exp(−ımx))).
Sinceδm→0 due to ( 38), we deduce that
inf
x∈RW′′
k(x)∈[−r1,−r2], k= 0,1,
26for some r1,r2>0. On the other hand, we deduce for some constant C >0 that

Asδ→0, we conclude that

isensuredbythechoiceoftheconﬁnementpotential V(x) =αx2/2+/tildewideV(x)(cf.Example

In view of these identities, we obtain

for some constants Cr5,Cc,r5>0. This proves that W0,W1∈ Ar,p,Jfor some ( p,r).
Next, we compute the norm ∝⌊ard⌊lW′
0−W′
1∝⌊ard⌊lL2(R). We obtain that
/integraldisplay
Rf2

for some constant c>0. Hence, we deduce that
∝⌊ard⌊lW′

1∝⌊ard⌊lL2(R)> c1/2δ.
27In the last step, we compute the Kullback-Leiblerdivergence K(P⊗N

0). Following
the arguments of the proof of [ 5, Theorem 5.1], if ∝⌊ard⌊lW′∝⌊ard⌊l∞<√CV−CW, we deduce
the inequality
K(P⊗N

0)/lessorsimilarN/integraldisplay
R(fδ,m⋆π0)2(x)π1(x)dx.
Consequently, we conclude that

Due to (38), we ﬁnally deduce that

The statement of Theorem 8now follows from [ 52, Theorem 2.2].
5 On the Fourier transforms
We have observed that Assumption 2 is crucial in order to obtain the polynomial con-
vergence rate stated in Theorem 7. However, this assumption may appear somewhat
unclear at ﬁrst. The objective of this section is to investigate suﬃc ient conditions that
guarantee the validity of Assumption 2 . Given our focus on the super-smooth case, it
seems natural to require that the transform of the function W′we aim to estimate
decaysexponentiallyfast.Verifyingthe condition( 16),however,entailsseekingalower
bound for the transform of π, which will be the main objective of this section. We will
thus commence by examining the properties of the Fourier transfo rm ofπ, with the
clear intention of studying the set of zeros and ﬁnding a lower bound outside that set.
Remark that it is the same whether considering the transform of th e distribution Π
or the density π, and it is
F(Π) =F(π) =/integraldisplay
Rexp(ızx)π(x)dx.
5.1 Properties of F(π)
We will use tools from complex analysis to study F(π) as a function deﬁned on C.
More speciﬁcally, our aim is to represent the entire function F(π) via the Hadamard
factorisation theorem. For deﬁnitions of the terminology used in th is work, we refer
to [32]. We begin by deriving an upper bound of the order of F(π), which stems from
the fact that πhas Gaussian tails. Let us recall that the order of an entire functio n
f(z) is the inﬁmum of all msuch that f(z) =O(exp(|z|m)) asz→ ∞.
28Theorem 10. LetAssumption 1 hold and πbe as in(5). The map
F(π):C→C, z∝ma√sto→/integraldisplay
Rexp(ızx)π(x)dx (39)
is an entire function which coincides with the characterist ic function of πonR.
Moreover, the order of F(π)does not exceed 2.
Proof.The integral in ( 39) exists and deﬁnes a continuous function at any z=a+

CF(π)(z)dz=
0 for any closed contour Cwhich follows from the Cauchy theorem applied to the
function z∝ma√sto→exp(ızx).By Morera’stheorem, F(π) is an entire function. To determine
the order of F(π), we use the inequality
|zx| ≤1

such that, for any z∈C,

π(x)dx.
Recall that according to Lemma 1 ,π(x)/lessorsimilarexp(−CVx2). Hence, the above integral is
ﬁnite ifx∝ma√sto→exp(−(CV−c/2)x2) is integrable on R, which is the case for CV> c/2.
As a result, the order of F(π) does not exceed 2.
Now that we have that F(π) is an entire function of ﬁnite order, we will ﬁnd
an expression for the function using Hadamard’s factorisation the orem. For this, we
denote the zeros of F(π) as (aj)j∈Nand order them by increasing modulus. Note that
the zeros are symmetric around the imaginary axis, in other words, ifajis a zero
ofF(π), then so is its negative conjugate −aj. Moreover, F(π) has no zeros on the
imaginary axis because F(π)(ıa)>0 for all a∈R, see [38, Corollary 1 to Theorem
2.3.2].Let us introducethe critical exponentofconvergence ρ1ofthe sequence( aj)j∈N:
ρ1= inf

r >0 :/summationdisplay

.
We denote the order of F(π) asρand make the following
Assumption 3. F(π)satisﬁes either ρ1< ρorρ1=ρ <2.
29We will use the Hadamard canonical factors
Ed(z) =/braceleftBigg
1−z, d = 0,
(1−z)exp(z), d= 1,
deﬁned for z∈C, to study the inﬁnite product representation of F(π).
Theorem 11. LetAssumption 1 andAssumption 3 hold and πbe as in(5)andF(π)
as in(39). Then, there exist p1∈Randp2≥0such that for all z∈C,
F(π)(z) = exp(−p2z2+ıp1z)/productdisplay
j∈NE1/parenleftbiggz
aj/parenrightbigg
. (40)
Proof.Firstly, we consider the case ρ1< ρ. Then ρis either 2 or 1 by [ 32,
Lemma 4.10.1]. The representation in ( 40) follows from [ 38, Remark, page 42]. We
note that if F(π) is of order ρ= 2, then p2>0 because p2= 0 would lead to the
contradiction ρ≤max(1,ρ1) by [38, Theorems 1.2.5, 1.2.7, 1.2.8]. However, if F(π) is
of order ρ= 1 then its representation may be reduced to
F(π)(z) = exp( ı/tildewidep1z)/productdisplay
jE0/parenleftbiggz
aj/parenrightbigg
,/tildewidep1:=p1+/summationdisplay
jIm/parenleftbigg1

.(41)
Next, we turn to the case ρ1=ρ <2. According to Hadamard’s factorizationtheorem,
F(π)(z) = exp(q1z+q0)/productdisplay
jE1/parenleftbiggz
aj/parenrightbigg
for some q1,q0∈C. We note that q0= 0 since F(π)(0) = 1. In order to say something
aboutq1, we note that Xwith a probability density function πsatisﬁesE[|X|]<∞.
Moreover, E[X] = 0, whence
0 = Re/parenleftbiggF(π)′(0)

z=0= Re(q1).
We conclude that ( 40) holds true with p2= 0,p1= Im(q1).
Remark 7. We have p2>0 only if ρ1< ρ= 2. IfF(π) has no zeros then πmust
be a density of a normal distribution with mean zero by [ 38, Corollary to Theorem
2.5.1], since ρis ﬁnite.
The following step consists in bounding the inﬁnite product in ( 40). If⌊ρ1⌋= 0,
the term/producttext
j∈Nexp(z/aj) is well-deﬁned, and the representation becomes
F(π)(z) = exp(−p2z2+ı/tildewidep1z)/productdisplay
j∈NE0/parenleftbiggz

30where/tildewidep1is the same as in ( 41). Let us now use [ 22, Lemma 4.12]. For all z∈Coutside
∪jBǫj(aj), where ǫj= 1/|aj|ρ1+εandε >0,ρ1+ε≤2, we get

aj/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/greaterorsimilarexp(−cπ|z|ρ1+ε).
It leads us to the following theorem.
Theorem 12. LetAssumption 1 andAssumption 3 hold. Then there exist cπ>0and
a family of positive numbers (ǫj)j∈Nsuch that, for any z∈Coutside∪j≥1Bǫj(aj), it
holds that
|F(π)(z)|/greaterorsimilarexp(−cπ|z|2). (42)
Remark 8. Note that without any additional assumption on F(π) one can prove a
rougher bound of the form
|F(π)(z)|/greaterorsimilarexp(−cπ|z|2+ε). (43)
forzoutside∪j≥1Bǫj(aj) whereεis an arbitrary positive number. This follows from
the fact that the order of F(π) does not exceed 2 and some estimates for the canon-
ical products, see Section 12.1 in [ 37]. As a result, the condition ( 16) is satisﬁed if
|F(W′)|/lessorsimilarexp(−c|z|2+ε) for some c > cπ.
The above theorem can be combined with the Hardy Uncertainty Prin ciple (HUP).
HUP is a fundamental result in harmonic analysis and mathematical ph ysics, extend-
ing the ideas of the classical Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Intr oduced by the
British mathematician G. H. Hardy in 1933, it provides a precise condit ion under
which a function and its Fourier transform cannot both decay too r apidly unless the
function is identically zero or a speciﬁc type of Gaussian function. Th e principle can
be stated as follows.
Theorem 13. Letfbe a function in L2(R), and letF(f)denote its Fourier transform.
Suppose there exist positive constants αandβsuch that:
|f(x)| ≤Cexp(−αx2)and|F(f)(u)| ≤Cexp(−βu2)
for all real numbers xandu, whereCis a positive constant. Then:
1. Ifαβ >1
4: The only solution is the trivial function f(x) = 0almost everywhere.
2. Ifαβ=1
4: The function f(x)must be a Gaussian function, speciﬁcally of the form:
f(x) =Cexp(−αx2)
whereCis a constant.
3. Ifαβ <1
4: There exist non-trivial functions that satisfy the decay c onditions.
This result gives us an upper bound on cπin (42). Indeed, if ∪j≥1Bǫj(aj)∩L0=∅,
that is, all zeros of F(π) are outside real line, then CVcπ<1/4 since
π(x)≤c2exp(−CVx2)
31due to Lemma 1. This implies the upper bound cπ<1/(4CV).
Thanks to Theorem 12, we can explicitly describe a scenario where condition ( 16)
is satisﬁed, assuming that we are in the super-smooth case where t he tails of the
transform of the interaction function are exponential.
Let us introduce slowly varying functions s(t), fort≥0 (see also [ 50]). These are
positive and measurable functions such that, for each λ >0, the following holds as
t→ ∞:s(λt)/s(t)→1.
Assumption 4. Let(aj)j∈N,cπ, and(ǫj)j∈Nbe as in Theorem 12 . Assume that
∪j≥1Bǫj(aj)∩ L0=∅. Furthermore, there is a slowly varying function ssuch that
liminf z→∞s(z)> cπfor which the following holds true on L0:
|F(W′)(z)|=O(exp(−|z|2s(|z|)))as|z| → ∞. (44)
Note that in the aforementioned assumption, we assert that the t ransform of W′
exhibits a decay that is almost Gaussian. This observation aligns with o ur expec-
tations, given the nature of the model under consideration, wher e the conﬁnement
potential is driven by x2.
It is noteworthy to observe that Theorem 5 in [ 49], speciﬁcally in the scenario where
¯a= 0,furnishesboth necessaryand suﬃcientconditionsforthe exis tenceofnon-trivial
functions exhibiting an almost Gaussian nature, accompanied by an a lmost Gaussian
Fourier transform as deﬁned in Equation ( 44). Furthermore, according to Theorem 1
in [30], if both W′and its Fourier transform F(W′)(z) follow the asymptotic behavior
O(|z|sexp(−1
2z2)) asz→ ∞, then each can be expressedasa ﬁnite linear combination
of Hermite functions. This provides concrete examples that satisf y our assumptions.
Corollary 2. LetAssumption 1 -Assumption 4 hold. Then, we have
/integraldisplay
L0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleF(W′)(z)
F(π)(z)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2

Proof.The corollary is a straightforward consequence of Theorem 12andAssump-
tion 4. We have indeed
/integraldisplay

L0exp(−|z|2s(|z|)+cπ|z|2)dz,
which is bounded due to Assumption 4 .
We can conclude by noting that, under the assumptions of Corollary 2,Assumption 2
is clearly satisﬁed. This implies that we can achieve a polynomial conver gence rate for
the estimation of W′, as stated in Theorem 7.
Example 1. In some cases we can directly derive the bound of the form ( 42). Let
V(x) =σ2x2/4 for some σ2>0.Suppose that W∈L∞(R) satisﬁes
π ⋆W′(x)>0, π ⋆W′′(x)<0, π⋆W (−x) =π ⋆W(x), x >0.
32We have for any ǫ∈(0,σ),
F(π) =c
Zπexp(−·2/(2(σ2−ǫ2)))⋆F(fǫ)
for some absolute constant c >0 where
fǫ(x) = exp(−x2ǫ2/2−π⋆W(x)).
We have
f′
ǫ(x) = (−xǫ2−π ⋆W′(x))fǫ(x)<0,
f′′
ǫ(x) =/bracketleftbig
−ǫ2−π ⋆W′′(x)+(xǫ2+π ⋆W′(x))2/bracketrightbig

for allx >0 and small enough ǫ >0.Hence

potentials V.
Example 2. Here we provide an example demonstrating how a non-smooth con-
ﬁnement potential leads to an invariant density with a Fourier trans form exhibiting
polynomial decay. We have that
π(x) =1
Zπexp(−2V(x)−W ⋆π(x)),
whereV(x) = (α/2)x2+/tildewideV(x) andW(x) satisfy Assumption 1 . In addition, assume
thatW,/tildewideVare inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable respectively on R,R\ {0}and there exist
33/tildewideV(J+1)(0±) := lim x→0±/tildewideV(J+1)(x)<∞such that
/tildewideV(J+1)(0+)∝\e}atio\slash=/tildewideV(J+1)(0−).
Furthermore, /tildewideV(j), 2≤j≤J+ 2, are bounded on R\ {0}. It provides that πis
inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable on R\ {0}and there exist π(J+1)(0+)∝\e}atio\slash=π(J+1)(0−). Then,
iteratively integrating by parts we obtain
F(π)(z) =1
(−ız)(J+1)(I−(z)+I+(z)),
where
I−(z) :=/integraldisplay0
−∞exp(ızx)π(J+1)(x)dx, I +(z) :=/integraldisplay∞
0exp(ızx)π(J+1)(x)dx.
If we integrate by parts once more, we obtain
I+(z) =1
ız/parenleftbigg
−π(J+1)(0+)−/integraldisplay∞
0exp(ızx)π(J+2)(x)dx/parenrightbigg
(45)
sinceπ(J+1)(x)→0 asx→ ∞andπ(J+2)is integrable, which in turn follow using the
same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 1. By Riemann’s lemma, the last integral
in (45) tends to zero and so
I+(z) :=−1
ızπ(J+1)(0+)+o/parenleftbigg1
z/parenrightbigg
asz→ ∞. Clearly an analogous reasoning applies to I−(z). It yields that for all large
enoughz,
|F(π)(z)| ≥c
|z|J+2.
Hence, the Fourier transform of πhas in this case a polynomial decay, as claimed.
Note that the absence of zeros on real line can be studied as in Exam ple1.
6 Proofs of technical results
This section is devoted to proofs of our technical lemmas. We start by providing the
proof of Lemma 1.
6.1 Proof of Lemma 1
We can write the invariant density π(x) in the following equivalent ways:
π(x) =1
Zπexp(−2V(x)−W ⋆π(x)) (46)
34=1
Z0exp(−2V0(x)−W0⋆π(x)), (47)
whereZπ,Z0are the normalizing constants and
V0(x) :=/integraldisplayx
0V′(u)du=V(x)−V(0),
W0(x) :=/integraldisplayx
0W′(u)du=W(x)−W(0),
satisfyW0(0) =V0(0) = 0 and W′
0(x) =W′(x),V′
0(x) =V′(x) for allx∈R. Note
W0⋆π(x) =W ⋆π(x)−W(0)
and
W0⋆π(x)−W0⋆π(0) =/integraldisplayx
0W′⋆π(u)du=W ⋆π(x)−W ⋆π(0).
To obtain the upper and lower bounds on π(x) let us use the representation ( 47).
According to Assumption 1 we have ∝⌊ard⌊lW′∝⌊ard⌊l1<∞. We deduce that for all x,
|W0(x)| ≤/integraldisplay|x|
0|W′(u)|du≤ ∝⌊ard⌊lW′∝⌊ard⌊l1,
hence,
|W0⋆π(x)| ≤ ∝⌊ard⌊lW0∝⌊ard⌊l∞∝⌊ard⌊lπ∝⌊ard⌊l1≤ ∝⌊ard⌊lW′∝⌊ard⌊l1.
We get that for all x,
π(x)≤1
Z0exp(−2V0(x)+∝⌊ard⌊lW′∝⌊ard⌊l1)/equalorsimilarexp(−2V0(x)) (48)
and
π(x)≥1
Z0exp(−2V0(x)−∝⌊ard⌊lW′∝⌊ard⌊l1)/equalorsimilarexp(−2V0(x)).
As we have assumed that there exists a CV>0 such that V′′≥CVwe obtain, for all
x≥0,
V0(x) =/integraldisplayx
0(V′(u)−V′(0))du+V′(0)x
≥CV
2x2+V′(0)x
and
V0(−x) =/integraldisplay0
−xV′(u)du
35=/integraldisplay0
−x(V′(0)−V′(u))du−V′(0)x
≥CV
2x2−V′(0)x.
In conclusion, for all x∈R, we deduce that
V0(x)≥CV
2x2+V′(0)x. (49)
Recall that V′(0) = 0 under both A1 and A2 as /tildewideV= 0 or/tildewideV∈C2(R) is assumed to
be even. The proof about the upper bound of πis therefore concluded.
Regarding the lower bound, we have that
π(x)≥cexp(−αx2−2/tildewideV(x)). (50)
Observe that, similarly as above, we can take advantage of the fac t that˜V′′≤˜c2to
obtain, for all x≥0,
/tildewideV(x)−/tildewideV(0) =/integraldisplayx
0(/tildewideV′(u)−/tildewideV′(0))du+/tildewideV′(0)x
≤˜c2/integraldisplayx
0udu=˜c2
2x2,
having also used that /tildewideV′(0) = 0. An analogous reasoning holds true for x≤0. It
implies that, for any x∈R,/tildewideV(x)≤/tildewideV(0)+˜c2
2x2. Replacing it in ( 50) we obtain
π(x)≥cexp(−αx2−˜c2x2−2/tildewideV(0)) =cexp(−/tildewideCx2)
with/tildewideC=α+˜c2, as we wanted.
Let us move to the proof of the upper bound on the derivatives of π. More speciﬁ-
cally, we want to prove by induction that for every natural number n≤Jthere exists
c >0 such that
|π(n)(x)| ≤c(1+|x|)nπ(x). (51)
Let us begin with the base case n= 1. Then π=−ϕ′π, whereϕ′:= 2V′+W′⋆π. Note
that|ϕ′(x)| ≤c(|x|+1), where |V′(x)| ≤c|x|follows from ∝⌊ard⌊lV′′∝⌊ard⌊l∞<∞andV′(0) = 0.
Now assume the claim ( 51) holds for all natural numbers up to and including n < J.
Then the ( n+1)-th derivative of πis
π(n+1)= (π′)(n)=−n/summationdisplay
k=0/parenleftbiggn
k/parenrightbigg
ϕ(k+1)π(n−k). (52)
The inductive hypothesis ensures that |π(n−k)(x)| ≤c(1 +|x|)(n−k)π(x). Moreover,
we have that |ϕ(k+1)(x)| ≤c(1 +|x|) since∝⌊ard⌊lW′⋆ π(k)∝⌊ard⌊l∞≤ ∝⌊ard⌊lW′∝⌊ard⌊l1∝⌊ard⌊lπ(k)∝⌊ard⌊l∞<∞,
36whereas |V(k+1)(x)| ≤c(1+|x|) follows from ∝⌊ard⌊lV(j)∝⌊ard⌊l∞≤c, 2≤j≤J. We conclude
by replacing it in ( 52), which yields
|π(n+1)(x)| ≤cn/summationdisplay
k=0(1+|x|)(1+|x|)(n−k)π(x)≤c(1+|x|)n+1π(x)
as we wanted, for n+1≤J.
6.2 Proof of Proposition 4

Taking the expectation and derivative gives

i=1E[2Ai(t)+Bi(t)+Ci(t)]. (53)
37Using the assumption V′′≥CV>0 and the mean value theorem gives
−E[Ai(t)]≤ −CVE[|Xi

t|2p]. (54)
The analysis of Bi(t) makes use of the symmetry of Wand the exchangeability of
(Xi

By the mean value theorem, the assumption −W′′≤CWgives

because of the independence of Xi

E[W′(Xi

k, then the 2 p-fold product vanishes. In other words, in order for a term to con tribute
to the sum in Ri(t), for every index jkthere must be another j/tildewideksuch that jk=j/tildewidek.
We can have at most Npof these combinations of indices. We recall we have assumed
∝⌊ard⌊lW′∝⌊ard⌊l∞<∞, which implies E[|W′(Xi

Sinceβ(0) =y(0) = 0 and CV−CW>0, the conclusion follows by integrating this
Gr¨ onwall-like diﬀerential inequality, which provides β(t)≤c/√
Nuniformly in t.

hence, it suﬃces to study the asymptotic growth rate of its even m oments in order to

Let us start by looking at E[exp(±cXi,N

−E[(Xt)2k−1W′⋆Πt(Xt)]≤ ∝⌊ard⌊lW′∝⌊ard⌊l∞E[|Xt|2k−1].
Thus, we obtain the inequality ( 59) forE[|Xt|2k] instead of E[|Xi
