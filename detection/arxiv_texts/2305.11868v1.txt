Abstract
We propose an adaptive algorithm for identifying the unknow n parameter in a linear exponentially stable single-input s ingle-output
inﬁnite-dimensional system. We assume that the transfer fu nction of the inﬁnite-dimensional system can be expressed a s a ratio of
two inﬁnite series in s(the Laplace variable). We also assume that certain identiﬁ ability conditions, which include a persistency of
excitation condition, hold. For a ﬁxed integer n, we propose an update law driven by real-time input-output d ata for estimating the
ﬁrstn+1 coeﬃcients in the numerator and the denominator of the transfer f unction. We show that the estimates for the transfer
function coeﬃcients generated by the update law are close to the true value s at large times provided nis suﬃciently large (the
estimates converge to the true values as time and ntend to inﬁnity). The unknown parameter can be reconstructe d using the transfer
function coeﬃcient estimates obtained with nlarge and the algebraic expressions relating the transfer f unction coeﬃcients to the
unknown parameter. We also provide a numerical scheme for ve rifying the identiﬁability conditions and for choosing nsuﬃciently
large so that the value of the reconstructed parameter is clo se to the true value. The class of systems to which our approac h is
applicable includes many partial di ﬀerential equations with constant /spatially-varying coe ﬃcients and distributed /boundary input
and output. We illustrate the e ﬃcacy of our approach using three examples: a delay system wit h four unknown scalars, a 1D heat
equation with two unknown scalars and a 1D wave equation with an unknown spatially-varying coe ﬃcient.
Keywords: Adaptive identiﬁcation, ﬁnite-dimensional approximatio n, irrational transfer function, partial di ﬀerential equation,

1. Introduction
Linear inﬁnite-dimensional systems are widely used to
model physical plants and identifying the unknown paramete r
in these models is a problem of fundamental interest in many
areas of engineering. There are two distinct approaches to p a-
rameter identiﬁcation: non-adaptive and adaptive. In the n on-
adaptive approach input-output data of the plant is collect ed
over a speciﬁc time-interval. A scalar cost function quanti fying
the diﬀerence between the collected output and the output of
a plant model which uses a parameter estimate is constructed .
Then an iterative minimization algorithm is employed to ﬁnd
the value of the parameter estimate which minimizes the cost
function and this minimizer is expected to be the true value o f
the parameter. In the adaptive approach, a di ﬀerential equa-
tion in time called the parameter update law is driven by the
real-time plant input-output data and generates estimates for
the unknown model parameter. These estimates are guaran-
teed to converge to the true value asymptotically in time pro -
vided certain persistency of excitation conditions are sat isﬁed
[11]. While more complex parameter estimation problems can
potentially be considered in the non-adaptive framework, t he

adaptive algorithms use real-time input-output data they c an be
used to track a slowly time-varying parameter and also to ide n-
tify sudden jumps in the parameter value [3], [15, Chapter 4] ,
[18]. Secondly, unlike non-adaptive algorithms, adaptive al-
gorithms are typically accompanied by persistency of excit a-
tion conditions which guarantee global parameter converge nce
[24]. Finally, adaptive parameter estimation algorithms c an po-
tentially be used in the design of adaptive controllers [5], [20].
In this work, we propose a novel adaptive parameter identiﬁ-
cation algorithm for a class of exponentially stable single -input
single-output (SISO) inﬁnite-dimensional systems.
Early works on the adaptive parameter identiﬁcation of
inﬁnite-dimensional systems, see [5], [12], [14], [24] and refer-
ences therein, assumed that the full state of the system can b e
measured. These works introduced and formally established
the notion of persistency of excitation for parameter conve r-
gence in the context of inﬁnite-dimensional systems. Build ing
on these works [7] and [20] proposed adaptive identiﬁcation al-
gorithms assuming only partial state measurements, which i s
also restrictive in the inﬁnite-dimensional setting. Unde r the
more realistic assumption that ﬁnite-dimensional outputs are
measured, adaptive identiﬁcation algorithms have been dev el-
oped for certain types of inﬁnite-dimensional systems in th e fol-
lowing papers (and the references therein): [13] and [21] ha ve
considered SISO ﬁnite-dimensional systems with unknown de -
lays; 1D hyperbolic partial di ﬀerential equations (PDEs) with
unknown constants in the boundary have been considered in [1 ]
and [6]; positive real inﬁnite-dimensional systems have be en
Preprint submitted to Elsevier May 22, 2023considered in [10] and 1D parabolic PDEs have been consid-
ered in [27, Chapter 12] under the structural condition that the
measured output multiplies the unknown parameter.
The recent set of works [16], [17] and [18] have proposed
adaptive identiﬁcation algorithms assuming ﬁnite-dimens ional
(often scalar) outputs that are applicable to a larger class of
inﬁnite-dimensional systems than those considered so far i n the
literature. In [18], a baseline algorithm and a simpliﬁed al go-
rithm with harmonic excitation are presented. Both the algo -
rithms are local in nature and require the initial guess of th e
unknown parameter to be su ﬃciently close to its actual value.
The adaptation law in both the algorithms contains a gradien t
term which can be computed only if a closed-form expression
of the system transfer function is known. So these algorithm s
cannot be applied to PDEs with spatially-varying coe ﬃcients.
In [16] the adaptation law in the baseline algorithm is suita bly
normalized to obtain ﬁnite-time convergence of the parame-
ter estimates and in [17] it is shown that the duration of con-
vergence (ﬁnite-time) can be decreased by introducing time -
varying adaptation gains.
A natural approach to the design of control /estimation al-
gorithms for an inﬁnite-dimensional system is to approxima te
it using nth-order ﬁnite-dimensional systems, then design al-
gorithms for the nth-order systems and ﬁnally show that the
algorithm designed for nsuﬃciently large can be applied to
the inﬁnite-dimensional system to achieve the desired con-
trol/estimation objective. This approach has been used in the lit -
erature for stabilization [2], [4], [8], [19] and motion-pl anning
[9], [28]. In this work we apply it to estimate the unknown
parameter in a class of exponentially stable SISO inﬁnite-
dimensional systems. We suppose that the transfer function of
the system can be expressed as a ratio of two inﬁnite series in s
(the Laplace variable). Considering the nth-order transfer func-
tion obtained by truncating these series suitably, we propo se
an update law (a di ﬀerential equation) for estimating the ﬁrst
n+1 coeﬃcients in the numerator and the denominator of the
original transfer function. The update law is implemented u s-
ing real-time measurements of the input and the output of the
inﬁnite-dimensional system. Under certain assumptions, w hich
include a persistency of excitation condition, we show that asn
tends to inﬁnity the asymptotic (in time) estimates of the tr ans-
fer function coeﬃcients generated by the update law converge
to the actual values. Using the estimates obtained by imple-
menting the update law with nsuﬃciently large and the alge-
braic expressions relating the transfer function coe ﬃcients to
the unknown parameter, we then reconstruct the unknown pa-
rameter. We remark that typically only the ﬁrst few transfer
function coeﬃcients are used for parameter reconstruction.
The class of inﬁnite-dimensional systems that can be con-
sidered using our approach described above includes many li n-
ear exponentially stable PDEs with constant /spatially-varying
coeﬃcients and distributed /boundary input and output. We re-
mark that when the unknown parameter in the PDE is spatially-
varying we can still employ our identiﬁcation algorithm to o b-
tain estimates for the transfer function coe ﬃcients, and these
estimates will be accurate provided certain assumptions ho ld.
However, in this case, reconstructing the unknown paramete rfrom the transfer function coe ﬃcients will be diﬃcult. The rea-
son for this is that the relationship between the transfer fu nc-
tion coeﬃcients and the unknown parameter, while simple in
the case of a constant parameter, can be very complicated in t he
case of a spatially-varying parameter. We illustrate all th is us-
ing an example in Section 5 which addresses the reconstructi on
of a linearly-varying parameter. The initial condition for the
update law in our approach described above can be chosen ar-
bitrarily; this is useful from a practical standpoint. Unli ke many
earlier works, we also provide a numerical scheme for verify -
ing the persistency assumptions under which our convergenc e
results hold. This scheme also enables us to choose an nsuch
that the estimates for the transfer function coe ﬃcients obtained
using the update law designed for the chosen nare close to their
actual values.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 con-
tains the detailed problem statement. We present our identi ﬁca-
tion algorithm in Section 3 and a numerical approach in Secti on
4 for verifying the main assumption in Section 3. In Section 5
we illustrate our results using three examples: the ﬁrst exa mple
is a second-order system with unknown scalars and unknown
output delay, the second example is a 1D heat equation with
constant (in space) unknown di ﬀusion and reaction coe ﬃcients
and boundary input and output and the third example is a 1D
wave equation with unknown linearly-varying (in space) ela s-
tic rigidity and boundary input and output. We present some
concluding remarks and directions for future work in Sectio n 6.

2. Problem Statement
Consider an exponentially stable single-input single-out put
linear time-invariant system Σwhose state evolution is gov-
erned by a diﬀerential equation on a possibly inﬁnite-
dimensional state space. We make the following natural as-
sumptions aboutΣ:
2(i) In the absence of input, the output of Σcorresponding to
any given initial state is in L2
γ([0,∞);R) for someγ<0.
(ii) When the input to Σis sin(ωt) for someω≥0, its output is
the sum of asin(ωt+φ) for some a,φ∈Rand a function
inL2
γ([0,∞);R) for someγ<0.
Suppose thatΣhas a transfer function Gwhich is a bounded (in
the sup-norm) analytic function on C+
γfor someγ <0. So for
any input u∈L∞([0,∞);R), the output yofΣcorresponding to
this input and zero initial condition satisﬁes
ˆy(s)=G(s)ˆu(s)∀s∈C+.
Here hatdenotes the Laplace transform. We also suppose that
there exist coeﬃcients pk,qk∈Rsuch that
G(s)=/summationtext∞
k=0pksk
/summationtext∞
k=0qksk∀s∈C+ (2.1)
and constants c0,c>0 such that
|pk|+|qk|≤c0ck
k!∀k≥0. (2.2)
The transfer function of many PDE models, including transpo rt
equations and stable 1D heat and wave equations with appropr i-
ate input and output, can be expressed in the form of the ratio
shown in (2.1) with the coe ﬃcients satisfying the estimate in
(2.2) for some c0,c>0, see examples in Section 5. Note that
(2.2) guarantees the convergence of the series in the numera tor
and denominator in (2.1) for each s∈C+.
LetΣcontain an unknown (time-invariant) parameter Θ.
Then some of the coe ﬃcients pkandqkofGin (2.1) may de-
pend onΘand will therefore be unknown. We address the fol-
lowing identiﬁcation problem in this paper.
Problem 2.1. Identify the unknown coe ﬃcients p kand q k
in(2.1) using only the input u (chosen appropriately) and
the corresponding output y of Σand reconstructΘusing
the identiﬁed coeﬃcients.
We remark that the above problem cannot be solved by let-
ting all the coeﬃcients pkandqkto be unknown since if there
exists one set of coe ﬃcients such that (2.1) and (2.2) hold, then
there exist inﬁnitely many such sets of coe ﬃcients. However,
when some of the coe ﬃcients in (2.1) are known, then there
may exist a unique set of unknown coe ﬃcients such that (2.1)
and (2.2) hold and this would render the above problem mean-
ingful (see Remark 3.2 for more details).
In Section 3 we propose an adaptive identiﬁcation algorithm
for estimating the unknown coe ﬃcients pkandqkofGunder
certain assumptions. We demonstrate the e ﬃcacy of our algo-
rithm and the reconstruction of the unknown parameter Θ(from
the identiﬁed coeﬃcients of G) using three inﬁnite-dimensional
systems in Section 5.
3. Identiﬁcation Algorithm
In this section, we present an approach for identifying the
unknown coeﬃcients pkandqkofGin (2.1). In our approach,we ﬁx an integer n>0 and driveΣusing an appropriate in-
put signal u=un(which has certain properties determined by
n) and denote the corresponding output yofΣbyyn. We pro-
pose an adaptive identiﬁcation algorithm, obtained by modi fy-
ing the one with an integral cost function presented in [15, S ec-
tion 4.3.5], for estimating the unknown coe ﬃcients multiplying
skwith k≤nin (2.1). The algorithm uses only the input signal
unand the output signal yn. We show in Theorem 3.5 that un-
der certain conditions, which include a persistency of exci tation
condition, the estimates for the coe ﬃcients of Gobtained using
our algorithm converge to their actual values as n→∞ .
First we present our identiﬁcation algorithm. Fix n∈Nand
someωn>0. Take the input of Σto be
un(t)=n+1/summationdisplay
m=1sin(mωnt)∀t≥0. (3.1)
Letynbe the output ofΣcorresponding to this input and zero
initial condition, i.e.
ˆyn(s)=G(s)ˆun(s)∀s∈C+. (3.2)
From the properties of Σit follows that yn=yn,ss+yn,tr, where
yn,tr∈L2
γ([0,∞);R) for someγ<0 and
yn,ss(t)=n+1/summationdisplay
m=1|G(jmωn)|sin(mωnt+∠G(jmωn))∀t≥0.
We refer to yn,ssas the steady-state of yn. LetΛnbe an ( n+1)th-
order stable linear system with single input, ( n+1) outputs and
transfer function matrix given as
Fn(s)=((n+1)ωn)n+1/bracketleftBig
1s··· sn/bracketrightBig⊤
(s+(n+1)ωn)n+1. (3.3)
We deﬁneΦunandΦynto be the outputs of Λnwhen the inputs
areunandyn, respectively, and the initial condition is zero. So
ˆΦun(s)=Fn(s)ˆun(s) and ˆΦyn(s)=Fn(s)ˆyn(s) for all s∈C+. Let
Φn(t)=/bracketleftBiggΦun(t)
−Φyn(t)/bracketrightBigg
∀t≥0. (3.4)
Then naturally
ˆΦn(s)=/bracketleftBiggFn(s)ˆun(s)
−Fn(s)ˆyn(s)/bracketrightBigg
∀s∈C+. (3.5)
Since unand the steady-state of ynare periodic functions and Λn
is a stable ﬁlter it follows that Φn=Φ n,ss+Φ n,tr, whereΦn,ssis
the periodic steady-state of ΦnandΦn,tr∈L2
γ([0,∞);R2n+2) for
someγ<0.
We collect the coeﬃcients in the numerator and denominator
ofGin (2.1) up to order nin a single vector βn:
βn=[p0p1···pnq0q1···qn]⊤. (3.6)
Let the estimated value of the vector βnat time tbe
¯βn(t)=[ ¯p0(t) ¯p1(t)···¯pn(t) ¯q0(t) ¯q1(t)···¯qn(t)]⊤,(3.7)
where ¯ pi(t) and ¯ qi(t) are estimated values of piandqiat time t.
If a coeﬃcient piis known, then we take ¯ pi(t)=piand if qiis
3known, then we take ¯ qi(t)=qi. Letαnbe the vector obtained
by dropping all the known coe ﬃcients from βn. So we get
αn=[pa1pa2···par1(n)qb1qb2···qbr2(n)]⊤, (3.8)
where 0≤a1<a2<···ar1(n)≤nand 0≤b1<b2<···br2(n)≤
n. Let r(n)=r1(n)+r2(n). The estimated value of the vector
αnat time t(obtained by dropping entries from ¯βn(t)) is
¯αn(t)=[ ¯pa1(t) ¯pa2(t)···¯par1(n)(t)
¯qb1(t) ¯qb2(t)···¯qbr2(n)(t)]⊤. (3.9)
In Example 5.1 in Section 5 we consider a system for which
all the coeﬃcients in the numerator and two of the coe ﬃcients
in the denominator of (2.1) are unknown. In Examples 5.2 and
5.3 we consider systems for which only the coe ﬃcients in the
denominator of (2.1) are unknown.
Consider the following cost function:
Jn(t)=¯β⊤
n(t)/bracketleftbigg/integraldisplayt
t−2π
ωnΦn(τ)Φ⊤
n(τ)dτ/bracketrightbigg
¯βn(t) (3.10)
for all t≥0. In the above expression we take Φn(t)=0 for
t<0. We update our estimates ¯ pi(t) and ¯ qi(t) for the unknown
coeﬃcients piandqiinαnvia the following update law:
˙¯αn(t)=−Γ/bracketleftBigg∂Jn(t)
∂¯αn(t)/bracketrightBigg⊤
∀t≥0, (3.11)
where the scalarΓ>0 is the adaptation gain.
Next we present the assumption under which we prove our
main convergence result in Theorem 3.5. Recall pkandqkfrom
(2.1),Φn(t)∈R2n+2in (3.4) and r(n) deﬁned below (3.8). Let
φn(t)∈Rr(n)be the vector obtained by dropping the entries
ofΦn(t) from the same positions from which the entries of βn
were dropped to obtain αnin (3.8). Then φn=φn,ss+φn,tr,
whereφn,ssis the 2π/ω n-periodic steady-state of φnandφn,tr∈
L2
γ([0,∞);Rr(n)) for someγ<0.
Assumption 3.1. For some known sequence of frequen-
cies(ωn)∞
n=1satisfying (n+1)ωn≥1for all n, there exist
sequences of positive scalars (κn)∞
n=1and (Tn)∞
n=1and an
integer N>0such that

While (3.12) is similar to the usual persistency of excita-
tion condition in the adaptive identiﬁcation literature, ( 3.13)
imposes constraints on the level of persistency κnin terms of
the coeﬃcients pkandqkand the frequency ωn. Since there is
no analytical approach for estimating κn(this is true even in a
ﬁnite-dimensional setting), Assumption 3.1 cannot be veri ﬁed
analytically. However, it can be veriﬁed numerically witho ut
generating input-output data when the unknown coe ﬃcients arepresent either only in the numerator or only in the denominat or
ofGin (2.1), see Section 4 for details. When the unknown co-
eﬃcients are present both in the numerator and in the denomi-
nator of G, then input-output data is required for verifying the
assumption. We have illustrated the numerical veriﬁcation of
the above assumption using three examples in Section 5.
Remark 3.2. The no pole-zero cancellation condition guaran-
tees a unique representation for the transfer function of ﬁn ite-
dimensional systems as a rational function whose denominat or
is a monic polynomial. This renders the problem of identify-
ing the transfer function coe ﬃcients meaningful. However, the
same condition does not guarantee a unique representation f or
the irrational transfer function of inﬁnite-dimensional s ystems
as a ratio shown in (2.1) . For example, the transfer function e−s
of a delay system can be expressed as a ratio shown in (2.1) with
no common roots between the numerator and the denominator
in two diﬀerent ways:
G1(s)=/summationtext∞
k=0(−s)k
k!
1, G2(s)=1
/summationtext∞
k=0sk
k!.
When an irrational transfer function is written as a ratio sh own
in(2.1) with some of the coe ﬃcients known, then it is possi-
ble that the rest of the coe ﬃcients are uniquely determined. In
this case the problem of identifying the unknown coe ﬃcients in
(2.1) becomes meaningful. While there is no simple test (like
the pole-zero cancellation condition) for verifying the ab ove
unique determination, Assumption 3.1 guarantees it indire ctly
by permitting the identiﬁcation of the unknown coe ﬃcients, see
Theorem 3.5.
We now present a simple lemma. Recall the coe ﬃcients pk
andqkfrom (2.1).

yss(t)=|G(jω)|sin(ωt+∠G(jω)). Then

Proof. LetNandDdenote the numerator and denominator, re-
spectively, of Gin (2.1). It follows from (2.2) that N(s) and
D(s) are well-deﬁned for any s∈C+and
D(jω)|G(jω)|ej∠G(jω)=N(jω). (3.15)
A simple calculation using the expressions for uss,yssgives

Expanding sin( ωt+∠G(jω)) and cos(ωt+∠G(jω)) in (3.17) in
terms of sin( ωt) and cos(ωt) and using (3.15) it is easy to verify
that the expression on the right sides of (3.16) and (3.17) ar e
the same, i.e. (3.14) holds.
4RecallΦn,ssintroduced below (3.5) and βnin (3.6). The last
n+1 entries ofΦn,ss(determined by the output yn) are related
to the ﬁrst n+1 entries ofΦn,ss(determined by the input un)
via the coeﬃcients pkandqkin (2.1). In the next proposition
we express this relation in the form of a linear regression mo del
in which the coeﬃcients vector βnappears linearly and multi-
pliesΦn,sswhich is known (this is called the plant parametric
equation in ﬁnite-dimensions [15]). Since the transfer function
Gin (2.1) is irrational, the regression model contains a resi due
δnwhich, under Assumption 3.1, converges to zero as n→∞ .
This model is the motivation for considering the cost functi on
Jdeﬁned in (3.10). Recall φn,ssintroduced above Assumption
3.1 andκnin Assumption 3.1.

Φn,sscontains up to nth-order derivatives of vn,ssandzn,ss, see
(3.21), and recall that φn,ssis obtained by dropping some entries

The limit in (3.19) now follows directly from the above esti-
mate, (3.26) and (3.13).
Recall the coeﬃcient vector αnin (3.8) and its estimate ¯ αn(t)
in (3.9). Note that ¯ αn(t) is determined by the choice of ωn. We
now present the main result of this section.
Theorem 3.5. Suppose that Assumption 3.1 holds for a
sequence of frequencies (ωn)∞
n=1. Then the estimates ¯αn(t)
forαnobtained via the update law (3.11) satisfy

Proof. From the deﬁnitions of ¯βnin (3.7), ¯αnin (3.9),Φnin
(3.4) andφnintroduced above Assumption 3.1, it is easy to
see that the constant matrix Ln=/bracketleftbig∂¯βn

ﬁesLnΦn=φn. Let ˜αn=¯αn−αn. From (3.10) and (3.11) we

We remark that since φnandhnare continuous functions of

LetNandTnbe as in Assumption 3.1. Note that /bardbl˜αn(t)/bardbl2

2Vn(t). Using this and (3.12) to bound the terms on the right-
side of (3.33), we get that
˙Vn(t)≤−4ΓκnVn(t)+/bardblhn(t)/bardbl2/radicalbig
2Vn(t) (3.34)
for all n>Nandt>Tn. Choose n>N,sn>Tnand let
dn=/parenleftBiggsupt∈[sn,∞)/bardblhn(t)/bardbl2√

.
From (3.34) it follows that ˙Vn(t)≤ − 2ΓκnVn(t) whenever
Vn(t)≥dnandt>sn. This immediately implies that Vn(t)≤dn
for all tsuﬃciently large. Therefore, using Vn(t)=/bardbl˜αn(t)/bardbl2
2/2,
we get
lim sup
t→∞/bardbl˜αn(t)/bardbl2≤supt∈[sn,∞)/bardblhn(t)/bardbl2
Γκn.
Taking lim sn→∞on both sides of the above inequality and using
(3.30)-(3.31) it follows that
lim sup

The limit in (3.28) now follows from (3.19) and (3.35).
Remark 3.6. From Theorem 3.5 it follows that if n is su ﬃ-
ciently large, then the error ˜αn(t)in the estimates for the co-
eﬃcients is small for large t. (For a discussion on how such
an n can be chosen in practice, see Remark 4.4.) So given an
integer m>0we can obtain good estimates for the unknowncoeﬃcients p kand q kfor k∈{0,1,...m}by choosing n suﬃ-
ciently large. Since p kand q kdepend on and can often be ex-
pressed as a simple function of the unknown parameter Θ, we
can reconstructΘusing the obtained estimates. The choice of
m depends on the dimension of Θ, i.e. the number of unknown
scalars being estimated. We have illustrated the reconstru ction
of an unknown parameter in the case of a delay, 1D heat and
1D wave equations in Section 5.
4. Numerical veriﬁcation of Assumption 3.1
In this section, we present an approach for verifying Assump -
tion 3.1 numerically without generating input-output data when
the unknown coeﬃcients are present either only in the numera-
tor or only in the denominator of Gin (2.1). More speciﬁcally,
given a sequence of frequencies ( ωn)∞
n=1, we derive an expres-
sion for computing κnfor each n∈Nsuch that the inequality
in (3.12) holds with this κnfor all t>Tnand some Tn>0, see
Propositions 4.2 and 4.3. (We remark that when the unknown
coeﬃcients are present both in the numerator and the denomi-
nator of G, one must compute/integraltextt
t−2π
ωnφn(τ)φ⊤
n(τ)dτusing input-
output data and then ﬁnd κnsuch that (3.12) holds, see Example
5.1.) Using the computed κnand the known upper bounds for
|pk|+|qk|, see the assumption below, it can be veriﬁed whether
the ratio inside the limit in (3.13) is su ﬃciently close to zero
when nis suﬃciently large. When the ratio is close to zero for
a certain n, the error in the estimates for the coe ﬃcients gener-
ated by our adaptive identiﬁcation algorithm which uses tha tn
will also be close to zero at large times, see Remark 4.4. Con-
sequently, by running our algorithm with that nwe can obtain
good estimates for the coe ﬃcients pkandqkofGin (2.1).
Assumption 4.1. There exist known sequences of scalars
(pu
k)∞
k=0and(qu
k)∞
k=0and constants c 0and c such that
|pk|≤pu
k≤c0ck
k!,|qk|≤qu
k≤c0ck
k!∀k≥0.(4.1)
Since some of the coe ﬃcients pkandqkcan depend on the
unknown parameter Θ, to verify the above assumption it is nec-
essary to assume certain bounds on Θ. As illustrated in the ex-
amples in the next section, see Figure 5, the bounds for Θcan
often be chosen arbitrarily and do not inﬂuence the veriﬁcat ion
of Assumption 3.1. However, choosing tighter bounds leads t o
more eﬃcient implementation of the identiﬁcation algorithm,
see Section 5.1.
Recall G,un,ΦnandEnfrom (2.1), (3.1), (3.4) and (3.20).
Using (3.2), (3.3) and (3.5) we get that ˆΦnand ˆ unsatisfy
ˆΦn(s)=HΦn(s)ˆun(s) for all s∈C+, where HΦn(s)∈C2n+2
is deﬁned as
HΦn(s)=En(s)/bracketleftBig
[1s s2···sn]−G(s)[1s s2···sn]/bracketrightBig⊤.
Recall that αn∈Rr(n)in (3.8) is obtained by dropping the
known coeﬃcients of Gfromβn∈R2n+2in (3.6). Let Hn(s)∈
Cr(n)be the vector obtained by dropping the entries of HΦn(s)
from the same positions from which the entries of βnwere
6dropped to obtain αn. So when all the coe ﬃcients in the de-
nominator of Gare known then
Hn(s)=En(s)/bracketleftBig
sa1sa2sa3··· sar1(n)/bracketrightBig⊤(4.2)
and when all the coe ﬃcients in numerator of Gare known then
Hn(s)=−G(s)Sn(s), (4.3)
with Sn(s)=En(s)/bracketleftBig
sb1sb2··· sbr2(n)/bracketrightBig⊤. Here r1(n),r2(n),
a1,a2,...ar2(n)andb1,b2,...br2(n)are as introduced in the deﬁ-
nition ofαn.
The next proposition presents an expression for computing
κnwhen all the coeﬃcients in the denominator of Gare known.
Proposition 4.2. Suppose that all the coe ﬃcients q kin the
denominator of Gin(2.1) are known so that Hnis given
by(4.2) . Then for each n∈Nandωn>0the inequality in
(3.12) holds with

(4.4)
for all t>Tnand some T n>0.
Proof. Note that Re/parenleftbigHn(−jω)Hn⊤(jω)/parenrightbigis a real symmetric
positive semideﬁnite matrix for any ω > 0. Soκndeﬁned in
(4.4) is non-negative. Clearly (3.12) holds for all t≥0 if this
κnis zero. So to complete the proof of this proposition, in the
discussion below, we suppose that κnin (4.4) is positive. Re-
call the following simple trigonometric identities: for k,m∈N,
θk,θm∈Randωn>0,

Fixn∈Nandωn>0. Since all the coe ﬃcients in the de-
nominator of Gin (2.1) are known, from the deﬁnitions of φn
andφn,sspresented above Assumption 3.1 and (3.21) it follows
that
φn,ss(t)=[v(a1)
n,ss(t)v(a2)
n,ss(t)···v(ar1(n))
n,ss(t)]⊤, (4.5)
where vn,ssis as deﬁned above (3.21). Using the deﬁnition of
vn,ssand the above trigonometric identities we get via a simple
calculation that

sion is equal to the real part of the ( i,k) entry of the matrix

(4.7)
Any real symmetric matrix minus its minimum eigenvalue mul-
tiplied with the identity matrix is positive semideﬁnite. A pply-
ing this property to the matrix on the right side of the above
expression it follows using the deﬁnition of κnin (4.4) that
/integraldisplayt

ωnφn,ss(τ)φ⊤

Sinceφn=φn,ss+φn,tr, whereφn,ssis a bounded periodic func-
tion andφn,tr∈L2
γ([0,∞);Rr1(n)) for aγ < 0 (see discussion
above Assumption 3.1), it is easy to see that

t→∞/integraldisplayt
t−2π
ωn/parenleftbigφn(τ)φ⊤

So, sinceκnin (4.4) is positive (see the beginning of this proof),
there exists Tn>0 such that

ωn/parenleftbigφn(τ)φ⊤
n(τ)−φn,ss(τ)φ⊤

inequality that the inequality in (3.12) holds with κnin (4.4) for
each n∈Nandt>Tn.
The following proposition presents an expression for κnwhen
all the coeﬃcients in the numerator of Gare known.
Proposition 4.3. Let Assumption 4.1 hold. Suppose that
all the coeﬃcients p kin the numerator of Gin(2.1) are
known so that Hnis given by (4.3) . For eachω> 0, let

Proof. Note that Re/parenleftbigHu

n⊤(jω)/parenrightbigis a real symmetric
positive semideﬁnite matrix for any ω > 0. Soκndeﬁned in
(4.9) is non-negative. Clearly (3.12) holds for all t≥0 if this
κnis zero. So to complete the proof of this proposition, in the
discussion below, we suppose that κnin (4.9) is positive.
Fixn∈Nandωn>0. Since all the coe ﬃcients in the nu-
merator of Gin (2.1) are known, from the deﬁnitions of φnand
φn,sspresented above Assumption 3.1 and (3.21) it follows that
φn,ss(t)=−[z(b1)
n,ss(t)z(b2)
n,ss(t)···z(br2(n))
n,ss(t)]⊤,
7where zn,ssis as deﬁned above (3.21). Mimicking the steps fol-
lowed to derive (4.7) for the φn,ssdeﬁned in (4.5) using the def-
inition of vn,ss, we can derive the following expression for the
φn,ssdeﬁned above using the deﬁnition of zn,ss:

(4.10)
From the deﬁnitions of Gin (2.1) and Guin the statement of
this proposition, it is easy to see that |G(jω)|≥|Gu(jω)|for any
ω > 0. Using this and the deﬁnitions of Hnin (4.3) and Hu
nin
the statement of this proposition we get Re ( Hn(−jω)H⊤
n(jω))≥

From this inequality, using the property of symmetric matri ces

/integraldisplayt

Finally, using the arguments presented below (4.8) we can co n-

equality that (3.12) holds with κnin (4.9) for all t>Tn.
Remark 4.4. For a given n, recall that ˜αn(t)is the error in the
estimates for the coe ﬃcients generated by our adaptive identi-
ﬁcation algorithm at time t using that n. Denote the ratio ins ide
the limit in (3.13) byρnand denote the same ratio, but with
|pk|+|qk|replaced with pu
k+qu
kfrom Assumption 4.1, by ρu
n. So
ρu
n≥ρn≥0. The limit lim n→∞ρn=0in Assumption 3.1 can-
not be veriﬁed analytically and must be veriﬁed numerically ,
see the discussion below the assumption. Naturally, numeri -
cal veriﬁcation entails computing the upper bound ρu
nofρnfor
several values of n and ascertaining that ρu
nis small when n
is large. This practical approach to the veriﬁcation of the l imit
turns out to be suﬃcient for the purposes of the estimation prob-
lem addressed in this paper. Indeed, using (3.26) and(3.27) in
(3.35) it follows that lim supt→∞/bardbl˜αn(t)/bardbl2≤4√
2πC2ρn, where
C=1+sups∈C+|G(s)|is independent of n. So if ρnis suﬃciently
small for some integer n >0, then the coeﬃcients estimation er-
ror˜αn(t)will also be small at large times for that n. Therefore
to apply the identiﬁcation algorithm in Section 3 to a given s ys-
tem we ﬁrst construct a plot of ρu
nversus n and then ﬁx an n
for whichρu
n(and consequently ρn) is close to zero. We have
illustrated this using three examples in Section 5, see Figu re 1.
5. Numerical examples
Recall from Section 2 the linear system Σ, its transfer func-
tionGin (2.1) and the unknown parameter ΘinΣ. In this sec-
tion, we use the identiﬁcation algorithm proposed in Sectio ns 3
and 4 to address Problem 2.1 introduced in Section 2 for threediﬀerent systems. For each system, we ﬁrst verify the hypoth-
esis onΣand whether the ratio inside the limit in (3.13) is suf-
ﬁciently close to zero for nsuﬃciently large. Then by running
our adaptive identiﬁcation algorithm with a su ﬃciently large n,
we estimate the transfer function coe ﬃcients pkandqkofG
and simultaneously reconstruct the unknown parameter Θfrom
these estimated coe ﬃcients.
The ﬁrst example considers a second-order system with out-
put delay. The system has four unknown scalars and the transf er
function Gof the system, written as a ratio shown in (2.1), has
unknown coeﬃcients both in the numerator and the denomi-
nator. The second example considers a 1D heat equation with
2 unknown scalars. We illustrate in simulations that our alg o-
rithm can be used to reconstruct these unknown scalars even
when they are slowly-varying in time. The third example con-
siders a 1D wave equation with an unknown linearly-varying
(in space) coeﬃcient. The presented examples address Prob-
lem 2.1 for the systems that they consider.
Example 5.1. LetΣbe the linear system with the following
state space model: for t≥0,

Here [ x1(t)x2(t)z(t)]∈R×R×L2(−τ,0) with [ z(t)](s)=
x1(t−s) for each s∈(0,τ) is the state, u(t)∈Ris the in-
put,y(t)∈Ris the output, the output delay τ=0.1,a=0.3,
b=1 and K=1.5. Clearly all the eigenvalues of/bracketleftBig
0 1
−b−a/bracketrightBig
have a negative real part and so Σis an exponentially stable
system which satisﬁes the assumptions (i) and (ii) presente d at
the beginning of Section 2. Let the parameters K,a,bandτbe
unknown, i.e.Θ= [K a bτ]. The transfer function of Σis
G(s)=Ke−τs/(s2+as+b) which can be written as
G(s)=/summationtext∞

unknown parameters K,a,bandτso as to verify Assumption
4.1 (see the discussion below the assumption): |K|≤10,|a|≤5,
|b|≤10 and|τ|≤0.2. Then clearly Assumption 4.1 holds with

Recallκnfrom (3.12) and ρu
nfrom Remark 4.4. Since un-
known coeﬃcients are present both in the numerator and the
denominator of Gin (5.1), the results in Section 4 cannot be
used to verify Assumption 3.1. Instead we use input-output d ata
for the veriﬁcation as follows. We ﬁrst ﬁx a sequence ( ωn)∞
n=1
withωn=1/(n+1). Then for n∈N, we driveΣby letting
its input uto be ungiven in (3.1) and denote the correspond-
ing output ybyyn. Using the input un, output ynand the ﬁlter
in (3.3) we obtain Φndeﬁned in (3.4) and from that we get φn
(which is deﬁned above Assumption 3.1). We then compute

Att=200 seconds we have ¯K(t)=1.503, ¯τ(t)=0.097,
¯a(t)=0.304 and ¯b(t)=1.002.
We implement our identiﬁcation algorithm in Section 3 on Σ
by taking n=11 sinceρu

In the update law (3.11) we take Γ = 50 and ¯α11(0) to be a
vector of appropriate dimension with each of its elements be ing
0.01. Using the estimates for the coe ﬃcients p0,p1,q0andq1
generated by the update law and the expressions
p0=K,p1=−Kτ,q0=b,q1=a
obtained from (5.1), we generate estimates for the unknown p a-
rameters K,a,bandτ. Figure 2 shows that our estimates for the
unknown parameters approach the actual parameter values at
large times, as predicted by our theoretical analysis in The orem
3.5 and Remark 4.4.Example 5.2. Consider the following 1D heat equation govern-
ing the temperature evolution in a rod of unit length: for t≥0,
Tt(ξ,t)=θTξξ(ξ,t)−λT(ξ,t)∀ξ∈(0,1), (5.2)
Tξ(0,t)=0, Tξ(1,t)=u(t). (5.3)
Here T(ξ,t) is the temperature at the location ξon the rod, u(t) is
the input and θ,λ> 0 are unknown parameters, i.e. Θ= [θ λ].
The output is
y(t)=T(0,t). (5.4)
The heat equation (5.2)-(5.3) along with the output equatio n
(5.4) can be written as an abstract evolution equation Σon the

˙x(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t), y(t)=CΛx(t). (5.5)
Here x(t)∈L2(0,1) is the state. The state operator Ais deﬁned

Agenerates an exponentially stable semigroup on L2(0,1), the
triple ( A,B,C) is regular and so Σin (5.5) is a regular linear
system. (All this has been discussed in detail in [22, Sectio n
IV] forθ=λ=1.) It follows from the properties of regular
linear systems [22, Section II] that Σis exponentially stable and
satisﬁes assumptions (i) and (ii) presented in the beginnin g of
Section 2. Taking the Laplace transform on both sides of (5.2 )-

Next we verify Assumption 3.1 for Σin (5.5). Recall κnfrom
(3.12) andρu
nfrom Remark 4.4. Fix a sequence ( ωn)∞
n=1with
ωn=1/(n+1). Since the unknown coe ﬃcients are present only
in the denominator of Gin (5.6), we can use (4.9) in Proposition
94.3 along with qu

computeρu

Suppose that the actual value of λis 1.5 andθis as follows:
θ=5 ift≤100 andθ=6+0.0005 tift>100. Soλand
θsatisfy the bounds assumed above (5.8). We implement our
identiﬁcation algorithm in Section 3 on Σby taking n=9 since
ρu

takeΓ=30 and each entry of the vector ¯ α9(0) to be 0.1. Using
the estimate for the coe ﬃcient q0generated by the update law
and the expression q0=/radicalBig

Example 5.3. Consider the following 1D wave equation gov-
erning the vibration of a string of unit length whose elastic
rigidity EIvaries linearly in space: for t≥0,
wtt(ξ,t)=(EI(ξ)wξ(ξ,t))ξ∀ξ∈(0,1), (5.9)
wξ(0,t)=wt(0,t), w(1,t)=u(t). (5.10)
Here w(ξ,t) is the displacement of the string at the location ξ,
u(t) is the input and EI(ξ)=a+bξwith a=20 and b=10.
The initial condition is w(ξ,0)=wt(ξ,0)=0 for allξ∈[0,1].
The measured output is
y(t)=w(0,t). (5.11)
We suppose that the strictly positive linearly-varying fun ction
EIor equivalently the scalars a,bare unknown, i.e.Θ= [a b].It is diﬃcult to formulate the wave equation (5.9)-(5.10)
along with the output equation (5.11) as an abstract evoluti on
equation. But if the input uis twice diﬀerentiable, like the in-
puts used for identiﬁcation in this work, then we can transfo rm
(5.9)-(5.11) to a simpler equation which can be written in th e
abstract form. So we suppose that uis twice diﬀerentiable and
deﬁne v(ξ,t)=w(ξ,t)−ξ2u(t) for all t≥0 andξ∈[0,1]. It
then follows from (5.9)-(5.11) that
vtt(ξ,t)=(EI(ξ)vξ(ξ,t))ξ+2(EI(ξ)ξ)ξu(t)−ξ2¨u(t),(5.12)
vξ(0,t)=vt(0,t), v(1,t)=0, (5.13)

linear operators from RtoXandCis a bounded linear operator
from XtoRit follows that ( A,[B1B2],C) is a regular triple and
soΣin (5.16) (or equivalently (5.12)-(5.14)) is an exponentia lly
stable regular linear system which satisﬁes assumptions (i ) and
(ii) mentioned in the beginning of Section 2.
Taking Laplace transform on both sides of (5.12)-(5.14) and

Next we verify Assumption 3.1 for Σin (5.16). Recall κn
from (3.12) and ρu
nfrom Remark 4.4. Fix a sequence ( ωn)∞
n=1
withωn=1/(n+1). Since the unknown coe ﬃcients are present
only in the denominator of Gin (5.21), we can use (4.9) in
Proposition 4.3 along with qu
kdeﬁned above to compute κn.
Then we can compute ρu

From the ﬁgure it is evident that ρu
nis close to 0 for nlarge.
We implement our identiﬁcation algorithm in Section 3 on Σ
by taking n=16 sinceρu
16=3.84×10−6, see Remark 4.4. In
the update law (3.11) we take Γ= 50 and the vector ¯ α16(0) as
follows: ﬁrst two entries of ¯ α16(0) are 0.02 and the rest of the
entries are 0. Computing q1andq2using the expressions given

ausing the ﬁrst expression in (5.24). Figure 4 shows that our

To verify Assumption 4.1 we have assumed certain arbitrary
bounds on the unknown parameter Θin Examples 5.1, 5.2 and
5.3. These bounds determine the values of pu
kandqu
kin (4.1)
and through them a ﬀect the computation of ρu
n(deﬁned in Re-
mark 4.4) and thereby inﬂuence the numerical veriﬁcation of
Assumption 3.1. However, as seen in the examples, changing
the bounds onΘonly changes certain powers in the numera-
tor of pu
kandqu
kand leaves the factorials in the denominator
unchanged. It is these factorials that enable the veriﬁcati on of
Assumption 3.1. To illustrate this we consider the followin g
less conservative bounds for Θin Examples 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3
and plot the corresponding ρu
nin Figure 5: We take |K|≤25,
|a|≤20,|b|≤25 andτ≤2 in Example 5.1, θ≥0.2 andλ≤20
in Example 5.2 and EI(0)≤150 and EI(ξ)≥2 for allξ∈[0,1]
in Example 5.3. As seen in Figure 5, similarly to Figure 1, ρu
nis
close to 0 for nlarge. So choosing less conservative bounds for
11Θdoes not invalidate the veriﬁcation of Assumption 3.1. How-
ever, it leads to larger values of pu
kandqu
kand therefore of ρu
n.
So an nselected for implementing our identiﬁcation algorithm
(such thatρu
nis less than a certain value) using Figure 5 will be
larger than an nselected using Figure 1. Thus assuming tighter
bounds onΘleads to a more eﬃcient and less complex (i.e.
smaller n) implementation of our algorithm.
6. Conclusions
In this paper we have proposed an adaptive algorithm for
identifying the transfer function coe ﬃcients of exponentially
stable single-input single-output inﬁnite-dimensional s ystems.
Our algorithm is implemented using real-time measurements of
the input and the output, and these measurements can be eithe r
distributed or boundary-valued. Using three examples, we h ave
demonstrated that an unknown (and possibly spatially-vary ing)
parameter in certain 1D PDEs can be reconstructed from the
transfer function coe ﬃcients identiﬁed using our algorithm. In
the examples, we have considered constant and linearly-var ying
parameters. While our identiﬁcation algorithm itself does not
preclude the consideration of a more complex spatially-var ying
parameter, the challenge lies in the reconstruction of the p aram-
eter from the identiﬁed transfer function coe ﬃcients. Prelimi-
nary studies indicate that increasing the number of outputs and
utilizing optimization algorithms at the reconstruction s tage are
two promising approaches for addressing this challenge. Bo th
these approaches will beneﬁt from an increase in the speed of
convergence of the identiﬁcation algorithm. We plan to expl ore
these ideas in a future work.
Appendix A.
Here we brieﬂy sketch a proof of the exponential stability of
the state operator Aintroduced below (5.16) in Example 5.3.
Our proof mimics those presented in [23, Section 5].
Recall that EI(ξ)=20+10ξ. Suppose that the input u=0.
Then since Agenerates a semigroup on X, it follows that for
any given initial state x(0)=/bracketleftBigv(·,0)
vt(·,0)/bracketrightBig
∈X, there exists a unique
state trajectory x(t)=/bracketleftBigv(·,t)
vt(·,t)/bracketrightBig
∈Xfor (5.12)-(5.13) starting from
x(0). Along the state trajectory deﬁne V(t)=H(t)+η(t) with

Clearly using Young’s inequality we have 0 .5H(t)≤V(t)≤
2H(t) for all t≥0. Diﬀerentiating Vwith respect to time and
using (5.12)-(5.13) (with u=0) it follows after a simple calcu-
lation via integration by parts that
˙V(t)≤−0.5H(t)−14.75v2
t(0,t)≤−0.25V(t),
which implies that
V(t)≤V(0)e−0.25t∀t≥0. (A.1)Strictly speaking, we can di ﬀerentiate Vonly along diﬀeren-
tiable state trajectories of (5.12)-(5.13). But we can show us-
ing regularity results (such as Theorem 1.5 in Chapter 6 of
[25]) that the estimate in (A.1) is valid along all state tra-
jectories of (5.12)-(5.13) (when u=0). It now follows us-
ing (A.1) and the expression 0 .5H(t)≤V(t)≤2H(t) that
H(t)≤4H(0)e−0.25t. So from (5.15) we get that along state tra-
jectories/bardblx(t)/bardbl≤2/bardblx(0)/bardble−0.125tfor all t≥0, i.e. Agenerates
an exponentially stable semigroup.
