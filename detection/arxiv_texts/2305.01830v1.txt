Abstract . This paper focuses on the study of the ﬁnite-time consensus (FT C) and ﬁxed-time consensus
(FXC) issues of multi-agent systems (MASs) driven by parabolicpar tial diﬀerential equations(PDEs). Com-
pared with the study in the existing literature, the topic of FTC and F XC control is ﬁrst embodied in MASs
driven by parabolic PDEs. Based on the Lyapunov theorems, the FT C and FXC controllers are devised to
ensure that the MASs converge to a stable state with external dis turbance. Furthermore, we simplify the
controllers to guarantee the FTC and FXC of MASs without externa l disturbance. Finally, two illustrative
examples are given to verify the feasibility of controllers.

1 Introduction
In recent decades, multi-agent systems (MASs) have aroused th e extensive interest of researchers in
many areas, especially in computer science, neural network, and c ooperative control. The research on
MASs provides necessary theoretical support for the practical application in engineering, such as control
problems of complex systems [ 1], UAV formation [ 2], and target tracking [ 3]. It is well known that consensus
problem is an essential research subject in MASs research, and its purpose is to make multiple agents
achieve agreement under the control protocol. Because of its wid e applications in modern industry, this part
of the research has a long history. Reynolds [ 4] ﬁrst proposed the Boid model according to the behavioral
characteristics of groups (such as sheep, cattle and school), wh ich was the earliest MASs model. Later,
Vicsek et al. [ 5] took a diﬀerent approach and ﬁrst established the model of MASs from the statistical point
of view, which provided a powerful tool to study the group moveme nt behavior. In 2004, Olfatid-Saber

1and Murray [ 6] proposed a general approach to solve the asymptotical consen sus issue of MASs based on
ﬁrst-order integrators. Recently, asymptotical consensus co ntrol for MASs has inspired extensive research
interest such as for second-order MASs [ 7], for high-order MASs [ 8], for fractional-order MASs [ 9], and so
on. More literature about asymptotical consensus issues, see [ 10–15] and the references therein.
However, most of the results in previous works of literature have a limitation, that is, the terminal time
cannot be controlled within a limited range. In practical applications, we often need a faster convergence
speed and hope MASs to reach consensus in ﬁnite time [ 16–18]. Therefore, it is vital to investigate the
ﬁnite-time consensus (FTC) issue of MASs. In order to make the sy stems reach the equilibrium point in
ﬁnite time, ﬁnite-time control theory was proposed [ 19]. Cortes [ 20] extended the theory of nonsmooth
stability analysis to study the FTC problem of MASs and proposed a dis continuous FTC controller. Wang
and Xiao [ 21] proposed a state feedback controller to solve the FTC issue of ﬁr st-order MASs. Li et al. [ 22]
studied second-order MASs with external disturbance and design ed a non-smooth FTC control protocol
using the backstepping method. Guan et al. [ 23] used the homogeneity theory to study the FTC problem
of second-order MASs with a leader in ﬁxed and switched topologies. For high-order systems, Fu et al. [ 24]
designed an observer-based FTC protocol. Recently, Duan et al. [ 25] solved the bipartite FTC problem for
heterogeneous MASs using ﬁnite-time observer based on event tr iggering mechanism. However, the initial
valuemaynotbe knownandusedinadvance, whichmakesthe FTCtec hnologyunworkable. Inordertomake
the terminal time independent of the initial condition, the ﬁxed-time control theory was also proposed [ 26].
Parsegovetal. [ 27]applied the ﬁxed-timecontroltheoryto ﬁrst-orderlinearMASs a nddesignedadistributed
controller to achieve the ﬁxed-time consensus (FXC). In addition, Defoort et al. [ 28] considered the FXC
problem of ﬁrst-order nonlinear leader-following MASs. When the ag ent’s dynamic behavior is nonlinear to
some extent, the leader’s state can be tracked by the followers’ s tate via designing corresponding ﬁxed-time
control protocols. Zuo [ 29] studied the FXC problem of second-order leader-following MASs an d designed
a FXC protocol using the sliding mode control method to make the sy stems achieve consensus in ﬁxed-
time. Zuo et al. [ 30] analyzed MASs with interference and designed a robust FXC proto col to enhance the
systems’ robustness. Zuo et al. [ 31] reviewed the theoretical researchresults of ﬁxed-time cooper ative control
in recent years. Compared with the traditional asymptotical cons ensus control theory, the FTC and FXC
control methods can achieve higher control accuracy, faster c onvergence speed, and better control eﬀect.
Recently, various theoretical results and applications have been s tudied extensively for the FTC and FXC
problems in the literature; for instance we refer the reader to [ 32–41] and references therein.
It is worth to be noted that most of the current research results on the FTC and FXC are obtained under
the assumption that dynamical systems of agents are driven by or dinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs).
However, in many cases, the dynamics system of agents is not only r elated to time but also aﬀected by
spatial location, such as the spread of infectious diseases, the ve hicle formation, the traﬃc management of
large-scale UAV systems, the urban traﬃc networks, the noise co ntrol, the temperature control in industrial
production, and so on, see [ 42–47]. Thus, it is more suitable to use partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs ) to
modelthesedynamicssystemsthantouseODEs. Recently, Pillonie tal.[48]investigatedthesynchronization
problem of MASs described by boundary-controlled heat equations and designed a consensus controller
through a nonlinear sliding-mode method eliminating the inﬂuence of bo undary disturbance. Yang et al.
[49] took into account the synchronization problem of nonlinear spatio -temporal MASs based on boundary
controllers and gave suﬃcient conditions to ensure systems’ cons istency. And Yang et al. [ 50] investigated
the output synchronization problem for parabolic partial diﬀerent ial systems and designed the feedback
controller according to output information to ensure the synchro nization. Very recently, Wang et al. [ 51]
2considered a special kind of ﬁrst-order hyperbolic systems and de signed the boundary protocol to reach the
FTC. Nevertheless, in some practical cases, it is necessary to con sider MASs based on parabolic PDEs with
external disturbance having the following form:
yi,t(x,t) =kyi,xx(x,t)+ui(x,t)+di(x,t), (1.1)
whereyi(x,t)∈Ris the state variable of the ith agent,ui(x,t)∈Ris the protocol of the ith agent,
di(x,t)∈Ris unknown external disturbance, and k >0 is a constant. Let us illustrate this fact with the
following food web network example introduced by Wang and Wu [ 52].
A food web can be described by a complex network model in which node s represent each species.
In limited habitats, the distribution of species is usually uneven, with d iﬀerent spatial densities of species
leading to corresponding diﬀerent migration. The spatial distributio n of species can be described as state
variables of nodes in parabolic partial diﬀerential systems, which de pends on both spatial and temporal
variables. In particular, a simple food web network model can be obt ained from [ 52] as follows:
wi,t(x,t) =kwi,xx(x,t)+ui(x,t), (1.2)
wherewi(x,t)∈Ris the spatial density of the ith species,ui(x,t)∈Ris the control input of the ith species,
andk>0 is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Clearly, MASs ( 1.2) is a special case of MASs ( 1.1) withdi(x,t)≡0. It
should be noted that the state of nodes in MASs may not be accurat ely measured in general since they are
often destroyed by various disturbances and noise. Inspired by t his fact and taking into account the external
disturbance, we consider MASs ( 1.1) based on parabolic PDEs with external disturbance in this work.
The abovementioned observations show that it is very important fo r agents to complete all planned tasks
in a limited time in engineering applications. On the other hand, there is a lack of uniﬁed results addressing
the FTC and FXC issues for MASs described by PDEs. Thus, how to de sign the controllers to solve the
FTC and FXC issues for PDE systems is still an open problem, which mot ivates this study.
The overarching goal of this paper is to investigate the FTC and FXC issues for MASs described by
parabolic PDEs with external disturbance. Compared with the stud y in the existing literature, the main
contributions of this paper can be listed as follows.
(1) A new model of MASs driven by parabolic PDEs with external distu rbance is proposed, which can
be used to describe the heat process utilized in science, engineering and practical experience in chemical and
biochemical engineering. It is the ﬁrst time that the FTC and FXC dist ributed controllers are designed to
satisfy diﬀerent control eﬀects in MASs with external disturbanc e.
(2) Compared with other works on FTC and FXC control for MASs wit h ODEs, the main diﬃculties in
studying MASs with PDEs are to construct the Lyapunov function, to estimate the state variables, and to
design the controllers. In order to overcome such diﬃculties, we ﬁr st construct the Lyapunov function in the
integral form to avoid the estimation of multivariate Lyapunov func tions. Because the state variables are
correlated with xandt, it is inevitable to estimate the state variables’ ﬁrst and second par tial derivatives
with respect to x. We then use the integration by parts method and Wirtinger’s inequa lity to transform the
estimationsofthe ﬁrst andsecond partialderivativesofthe stat evariablesinto the onesofthe state variables,
which can be estimated via some known inequalities in [ 6,21,53,54]. Finally, we design the controllers using
the Lyapunov method for PDEs [ 19,26].
(3) Diﬀerent from the research on consensus control for MASs d riven by PDEs, the control objective
considered in this paper is to achieve consensus in ﬁnite time or ﬁxed t ime, which is more diﬃcult to use the
3information of neighboring agents to improve the convergencespe ed. A systematic approach is ﬁrst proposed
to accelerate the convergence speed and improve the control eﬀ ect by adding a new control coeﬃcient to
each controller.
The remainder of this work is structured as follows. The next sectio n recalls some critical lemmas, and
formulates the FTC and FXC problem. After that in Section III, we a nalyze the FTC and FXC of MASs
with external disturbance via the controllers. Before summarizing the results in Section V, we provide two
simulation examples to demonstrate the feasibility of controllers in Se ction IV.

2.3 Problem Formulation
In this work, we will consider the FTC and FXC problems of parabolic pa rtial diﬀerential MASs with
external disturbance. Assume that MASs including Nagents have the following form:


yi,t(x,t) =kyi,xx(x,t)+ui(x,t)+di(x,t),
yi(0,t) =yi(L,t) = 0,
yi(x,0) =y0
i(x), i= 1,2,···,N,(2.4)
wherex∈[0,L] is the location, t∈ {0}/uniontextR+is the elapsed time, yi(x,t)∈Ris the state variable of the ith
agent,y0
i(·) is the initial condition of the ith agent such that y0
i(·) is bounded and continuous with respect
tox,ui(x,t)∈Ris the protocol of the ith agent,di(x,t)∈Ris the unknown external disturbance, and
k>0 is a constant.
Assume that di(x,t)∈Rsatisﬁes the following conditions:
(i)di(x,t) is continuous with respect to xandt;
(ii)|di(x,t)| ≤dmaxfor any given x∈[0,L],t∈[0,+∞) andi= 1,2,···,N, where the upper bound dmax
is a known constant.
Deﬁnition 2.4. MASs (2.4) achieves the FTC if there exists a ﬁnite time t∗for any given x∈[0,L] and
i,j= 1,2,···,Nsatisfying
lim
t→t∗|yi(x,t)−yj(x,t)|= 0.
Moreover, MASs ( 2.4) achieves the FXC if the ﬁnite time t∗<Tmax, whereTmaxis a positive constant and
independent of the initial condition.
Remark 2.1. It is worth mentioning that the control objectives of MASs ( 2.4) are to design the correspond-
ing controllers to achieve the FTC or the FXC.
For the sake of simplicity, let’s note ξij(x,t) =yi(x,t)−yj(x,t). To achieve the FTC, we design the
controllerui(x,t) via state values by setting
ui(x,t) =−N/summationdisplay
j=1aij/parenleftBigg/integraldisplayL

/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
(II), (2.5)
where 0<α<1,aij≥0 and¯d>0 are given constants.
6Remark 2.2. In the controller ( 2.5), Part (I) ensure the FTC and the role of Part (II) is to countera ct the
inﬂuence of external disturbance.
To reach the FXC, we design the controller ui(x,t) via state values by setting
ui(x,t) =−N/summationdisplay

(III), (2.6)
where 0<α<1,β >1,aij≥0 and¯d>0 are given constants.
Remark 2.3. Compared with the controller ( 2.5), Part (II) of controller ( 2.6) is to make the ﬁnite terminal
time independent of the initial condition.
Remark 2.4. Noting that the FXC problem can be considered as an evolution of the FTC problem. In
fact, the FTC and the FXC controllers ensure the systems to achie ve consensus in ﬁnite time, but they have
the diﬀerent convergence rates and the diﬀerent estimations for the ﬁnite terminal time.
Obviously, if di(x,t)≡0, then MASs ( 2.4) is reduced to the following form:


yi,t(x,t) =kyi,xx(x,t)+ui(x,t),
yi(0,t) =yi(L,t) = 0,
yi(x,0) =y0
i(x), i= 1,2,···,N.(2.7)
In other words, MASs ( 2.7) is a special case of MASs ( 2.4).
To achieve the FTC, we design the controller ui(x,t) via state values by setting
ui(x,t) =−N/summationdisplay
j=1aij/parenleftBigg/integraldisplayL
0ξij(x,t)2dx/parenrightBiggα−1
ξij(x,t), (2.8)
where 0<α<1 andaij≥0 are constants.
Similarly, to achieve the FXC, we design the controller ui(x,t) via state values by setting
ui(x,t) =−N/summationdisplay
j=1aij/parenleftBigg/integraldisplayL
0ξij(x,t)2dx/parenrightBiggα−1

0ξij(x,t)2dx/parenrightBiggβ−1
ξij(x,t), (2.9)
where 0<α<1,β >1 andaij≥0 are constants.
Remark 2.5. Since MASs ( 2.7) is a special case of MASs ( 2.4) withdi(x,t)≡0, we can simplify the
controller ( 2.5) as the controller ( 2.8) to reach FTC via omitting the Part (II). Similarly, we can obtain the
ﬁxed-time controller ( 2.9) of MASs ( 2.7).
72.4 Unique Solvability of MASs (2.4)
Proposition 2.1. Suppose that graph Gis undirected and connected. Then MASs ( 2.4) with the controller
(2.5) (or (2.6)) has a unique solution.
ProofFor convenience, the variables ( x,t) are omitted in the following proof. We ﬁrst prove that the
following system ( 2.10) has a unique solution


yt=yxx+d,
y(0,t) =y(L,t) = 0,
y(x,0) =y0(x),(2.10)
wherey= [y1,···,yN]T,d= [d1,···,dN]T, andy0(x) = [y0
1(x),···,y0
N(x)]T. In fact, since y0(x) anddare
continuous, it follows from Lemma 2.6that the system ( 2.10) has a unique solution.
Next we show that the following system ( 2.11) has a unique solution


yt−kyxx=u(y),
y(0,t) =y(L,t) = 0,
y(x,0) =y0(x),(2.11)
wherey= [y1,···,yN]Tandy0(x) = [y0
1(x),···,y0
N(x)]T. Indeed, since y0(x) is bounded and continuous
with respect to x, we know that y0(·)∈ L∞([0,L],Rn). Noting that the controllers ( 2.5) and (2.6) include
sign functions, we can set the signal switching times to be tmwith 0 =t0<t1<···<tm<···. Thus, it
follows that u(·) is continuously diﬀerentiable with respect to yon [tm,tm+1). From Lemma 2.7, there exists
a constant TM,m>0 such that the system ( 2.11) has a unique solution on [0 ,L]×[tm,min{tm+1,TM,m}).

8Thus, one has V(t)≤V(0)<∞. According to Lemma 2.7, we haveTM,m=∞form= 0,1,2,···and
so the system ( 2.11) has a unique solution on [0 ,L]×[tm,tm+1) form= 0,1,2,···, which means that the
system (2.11) has a unique solution in the whole domain.
Thus, by the unique solvability of systems ( 2.10) and (2.11), we know that MASs ( 2.4) with the controller
(2.5) (or (2.6)) has a unique solution. This completes the proof.
Remark 2.6. Since MASs ( 2.7) is a special case of MASs ( 2.4), it follows from Proposition 2.1that MASs
(2.7) with (2.8) (or (2.9)) has a unique solution.

Since MASs ( 2.7) is a special case of MASs ( 2.4), we have the following corollaries which show the FTC

From Theorem 3.1, it is easy to see that MASs ( 4.22) with (4.25) and (4.26) via the controller ( 4.23) can
achieve the FTC at t∗andt∗≤7.746. Fig. 2and Fig. 3show the states and the sections of MASs ( 4.22)
with (4.25) and (4.26) via the controller ( 4.23) atx= 0.5,1.0,1.5, respectively. Fig. 6displays the sections
of MASs ( 4.22) without control at x= 0.5,1.0,1.5, respectively. Thus, the controller ( 4.23) can ensure the
FTC of MASs ( 4.22) with (4.25) and (4.26).
It follows from Theorem 3.2that MASs ( 4.22) with (4.25) and (4.26) via the controller ( 4.24) can reach
the FXC at t∗andt∗≤Tmax= 7.226. Fig. 4and Fig. 5indicate the states and the sections of MASs ( 4.22)
with (4.25) and (4.26) via the controller ( 4.24) atx= 0.5,1.0,1.5, respectively. Therefore, the controller
(4.24) can guarantee the FXC of MASs ( 4.22) with (4.25) and (4.26).

/braceleftBigg
yi,t= 10−3·yi,xx+ui,
yi(0,t) =yi(2,t) = 0, i= 1,2,3,(4.29)
the FTC controller can be formulated as

It is worth mentioning that the distributed consensus controller co nsidered in [ 57] was given by

and the consensus boundary controller studied in [ 48] was designed as follows

From Theorem 3.3, it is easy to see that MASs ( 4.29) with (4.32) via the controller ( 4.30) can achieve the
FTC att∗andt∗≤4.15. Fig.12and Fig. 13show the states and the sections of MASs ( 4.29) with (4.32) at
x= 0.5,1.0,1.5, respectively. Fig. 16displays the sections of MASs ( 4.29) without control at x= 0.5,1.0,1.5,
respectively. Thus, the controller ( 4.30) can ensure the FTC of MASs ( 4.29) with (4.32).
It follows from Theorem 3.4that MASs ( 4.29) with (4.32) via the controller ( 4.31) can reach the FXC at
t∗andt∗≤Tmax= 3.92. Fig.14and Fig. 15indicate the states and the sections of MASs ( 4.29) with (4.32)
atx= 0.5,1.0,1.5, respectively. Therefore, the controller ( 4.31) can guarantee the FXC of MASs ( 4.29) with
(4.32).
20The sections of MASs ( 4.29) with (4.32) via the controllers( 4.33) and (4.34) atx= 0.5,1.0,1.5are shown
in Fig.17and Fig. 18, respectively. By Fig. 13, Fig.15, Fig.17and Fig. 18, we can see that the controllers
(4.30) and (4.31) have faster convergence speed than the controllers ( 4.33) and (4.34). Moreover, Fig. 13
and Fig. 17display that the convergence speed of the controller ( 4.33) is faster than the one of the controller
(4.30) in the ﬁrst half but it decreases in the second half.

5 Conclusions
This paper studies the FTC and FXC issues of MASs driven by parabolic PDEs. We design the FTC and
FXCdistributedcontrollerstosatisfydiﬀerentcontroleﬀects inM ASswith externaldisturbance. Theoretical
analysis shows that agents can reach the FTC and FXC under an und irected and connected graph or a
directed, s-con, and d-bal graph. We also simplify controllers to so lve the FTC and FXC issues of MASs
without external disturbances. This work provides theoretical s upport for solving the FTC and FXC control
problems of MASs described by parabolic PDEs. Furthermore, it give s some technical guidance towards
the design of the controller to satisfy diﬀerent control eﬀects in M ASs with/without external disturbance.
However, for MASs driven by parabolic PDEs under event-triggerin g scheme or cyber attacks, how to ensure
the reliability of the controller is still an open problem.
Notingthat, insomerealsituations, it is necessaryand importantt oco-considerothercontrolproblemsin
MASs such as the event-triggered control problem, the fuzzy fa st-tracking control problem, the cyber attack
problem and so on. Our future work will consider designing ﬁnite-time event-triggered and observer-based
control strategies to solve the FTC and FXC problems of MASs drive n by more general PDEs.
