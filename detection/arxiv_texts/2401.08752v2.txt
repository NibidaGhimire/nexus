We present a framework to compute amplitudes for the gravita tional analog of the Raman process,
aquasi-elastic scatteringofwavesoﬀcompactobjects, inw orldline eﬀectiveﬁeldtheory(EFT).Asan
example, we calculate third post-Minkowskian (PM) order ( O(G3)), or two-loop, phase shifts for the
scattering of a massless scalar ﬁeld including all tidal eﬀe cts and dissipation. Our calculation unveils
two sources of the classical renormalization-group ﬂow of d ynamical Love numbers: a universal
running independent of the nature of the compact object, and a running self-induced by tides.
Restricting to the black hole case, we ﬁnd that our EFT phase s hifts agree exactly with those from
general relativity, provided that the relevant static Love numbers are set to zero. In addition, we
carry out a complete matching of the leading scalar dynamica l Love number required to renormalize
auniversal short scale divergence in the S-wave. Our result s pave the way for systematic calculations
of gravitational Raman scattering at higher PM orders.
Introduction. – Recent advances in gravitational wave
astronomyhavespurredthedevelopmentofeﬃcienttech-
niques forprecisioncalculationsofbinary dynamics. One
such technique is worldline eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT)
for compact binaries [ 1–6], wherein a compact object (a
neutron star or black hole) is represented at large dis-
tances as a point particle, and which provides a system-
atic programforthe perturbative computationofinspiral
waveforms. More generally, the EFT paradigm enables
an accurate description of a variety of physical eﬀects:
tides and dissipation [ 2,7,8], spin [4,9,10], Hawking
radiation [ 11,12], self-force [ 13–16], etc.
In thisLetter, we use the EFT framework to calculate
mildly inelastic gravitational scattering of massless ﬁelds
oﬀ compact objects. This is a direct gravitational analog
of Raman scattering of photons that is commonly used
to elucidate the internal structure of molecules. Here we
explore its gravitational counterpart to probe the nature
of compact relativistic objects.
In the worldline EFT the ﬁnite-size structure of com-
pact objects is captured by multipole moments on the
particle’s worldline non-minimally coupled to the grav-
itational ﬁeld [ 1,2]. The associated Wilson coeﬃcients

‡jpm@phas.ubc.ca
§zihanz@princeton.eduprovide a gauge-invariant deﬁnition of the tidal deforma-
bility of the objects, also known as Love numbers [ 1,17–
24]. These are free parameters in the EFT which have to
be either measured from data or extracted from a match-
ing calculation to a microscopic theory, if the latter is
available. Once the values of matching coeﬃcients are
determined they canbe used to make further predictions.
The universality and consistency of the EFT thus guar-
antee its predictability.
Scattering amplitudes are particularly suitable for
matchingcalculations: theyaresimple,manifestlygauge-
invariant, and ﬁeld-redeﬁnition independent objects [ 1,
3,25–29]. In addition, in the post-Minkowskian (PM)
regime (formal perturbation theory in Newton’s constant
G) they can be directly compared to known amplitudes
in full classical general relativity (GR). These matching
calculations also provide new insights into the general
structure of gravitational scattering amplitudes by con-
fronting them with exact non-perturbative results from
black hole solutions. In this vein, partial results on the
calibration of Love numbers from scattering amplitudes
exploiting the so-called near-far factorization were given
in [28,29]. A numerical estimation of tidal eﬀects from
scattering of a pointlike particle with scalar charge by
black holes at 4PM order was carried out in [ 30]. Finally,
the scattering of photons and gravitons oﬀ compact ob-
jects is, in principle, an observable phenomenon relevant
in astrophysics and cosmology, see e.g. [ 31–34].2
We present a general framework for systematic com-
putations of EFT amplitudes for gravitational Raman
scattering at high PM orders. Our approach makes use
of the background ﬁeld method and advanced multiloop
integration techniques. We demonstrate its power by ex-
plicitly calculating the amplitudes for spin-0 ﬁelds scat-
tering oﬀ a non-spinning compact object through 3PM
order,O(G3), where ﬁnite-size eﬀects ﬁrst appear. We
ﬁnd that the amplitude exhibits ultraviolet (UV) diver-
gences, whose renormalization requires contact worldline
operators. They are scalar analogs of the “dynamical
Love number,” a coeﬃcient that sets the strength of the
multipole moment tidally induced by an external time-
dependent ﬁeld. We show that dynamical Love num-
bers undergo renormalization group running due to two
diﬀerent eﬀects. The ﬁrst source of renormalization is
the gravitational “dressing” of the point particle action.
As such, this running is universal for any compact ob-
ject. The second source of the running is the gravita-
tional “dressing” of the static Love number. We call
such running “self-induced”, as its strength is set by the
amplitude of lower order tidal Wilson coeﬃcients (see
also [29,35–37] for similar discussions).
Assuming that a compact object is a black hole,
and using results from black hole perturbation theory
(BHPT)[ 28,38–46],theEFTscatteringamplitudesallow
for a complete order-by-order matching of tidal eﬀects,
including dissipation. Matching the 3PM scattering am-
plitudes to BHPT, we prove explicitly that the leading
static tidal coeﬃcient is zero and does not run, in agree-
mentwithpreviousoﬀ-shellcalculations[ 22,23,47]. This
also implies the vanishing of the self-induced tidal coef-
ﬁcients. In addition, we completely match the leading
spin-0 dynamical Love number. Finally, we compute the
running of the scalar dissipation operators thus extend-
ing the previous calculations from [ 7,26,29,48]. Our
results set the stage for forthcoming spin-2 calculations.
Worldline EFT and power counting. – The ﬁrst ingre-
dient of the worldline EFT is the “bulk” action for the
massless scalar and gravitational ﬁelds

tic point-particle action and Sfsis an action encoding
ﬁnite size eﬀects. As mentioned in the introduction, in
the language of eﬀective ﬁeld theory the latter appear
as higher-dimension operators on the worldline and cou-
plings of the ﬁelds to dynamical multipole moments de-
scribing the internal degrees of freedom of the compact
object,QL. For scalars, this action reads [ 2,7]

where in the EFT the multipoles, QL, are composite op-
erators,Lis a multi-index denoting the symmetric trace-
less combination ℓindices, and ∂= (gµν+uµuν)∂µ, with
uρthe object’s 4-velocity, is the spatial derivative in the
rest frame of the compact object. Sct
fsis the counterterm
action discussed shortly. The dynamical dipole coupling/integraltext
dτQ·∂φis analogous to the familiar dipolar electro-
magnetic interaction. In the EFT we are ignorant about
the microscopic nature of the multipoles. Instead, we
are interested in their correlation functions, such as the
Fourier transformed time-ordered two-point function,
/integraldisplay

which at low frequencies takes the form
Fℓ(ω) =Cℓ,ω0+iCℓ,ω|ω|+Cℓ,ω2ω2+···(5)
The corresponding Wilson coeﬃcients Cℓ,ωnare collec-
tively known as Love numbers. The static Love num-
bers (n= 0) describe the response of the compact ob-
ject to time-independent ﬁelds (static tides) with dif-
ferent multipolar proﬁle. These have been extensively
studied for neutron star and black holes [ 18,19,49,50],
which yielded a surprising result that they vanish for
black holes in D= 1 + 3 [ 20–24,51] (symmetry expla-
nations were proposed in [ 47,52–54]). The coeﬃcients
Cℓ,ω2n(n>0) are called “dynamical Love numbers,” as
they describe the response to time-dependent ﬁelds. We
refer toCℓ,ω2n+1as dissipation numbers.
Real parts of Fℓare analytic functions that describe
conservative ﬁnite-size eﬀects. As such, they can be fully
absorbed into the local worldline counterterm action,

massless scalar, i.e., C0,ω0= 0.
In contrast, Im Fℓdescribes the dissipative part of the
response and cannot be written in terms of local world-
line operators. This will capture inelastic eﬀects, e.g. ab-
sorption or tidal heating. Note that formally Fℓare cor-
relators of renormalized multipole moments that receive
scale-dependence through gravitational dressing [ 55,56].

second expansion parameter independent of Gm.
EFT Scattering Amplitudes. – The eﬀective action ( 1)-
(2) can be used to calculate the quantum amplitudes
for scalars scattering oﬀ a compact object. We com-
pute the full EFT amplitudes following the approach
of [16,57], i.e. expanding the eﬀective action around a
background solution given by the worldline moving in a
straight trajectory, xµ(τ) =uµτ, and the metric given by
the large-distance expansion of the Schwarzschild metric
in isotropic coordinates,

(D−2)-dimensional sphere. Famously, this expansion
resums the perturbative solution to Einstein’s equation
with a point source [ 58], which corresponds to an inﬁnite
number of worldline Feynman diagrams. The recoil of
the worldline is subleading in the low-frequency limit,
and the metric ﬂuctuations arenot relevant for the scalar
ﬁeld amplitude, so we will also ignore them henceforth.
The full scalar amplitude is simply given by iterative
scattering against the background plus the scattering oﬀ
the dynamical multipole moments. The correspondingbackground-ﬁeld Feynman diagrams are

We will compute all integrals in dimensional regulariza-
tion withD= 4−2ǫ. Using integration-by-parts (IBP)
identities [ 59] we can reduce any integral in such family
to a basis of master integrals given by

G1101100,G1110100,G1111100,G2111100}.(14)
where we use the notation in Eq. ( 12). Their dependence
on the frequency ωis ﬁxed by the dimensional analysis,
so they are only non-trivial functions of the scattering
angle, which we parameterize by x= sinθ
2. We compute
the dependence on xby using the method of diﬀerential4
equations for Feynman integrals [ 60–62]. Indeed, it is
not diﬃcult to ﬁnd a basis /vectorf={fi=1,···,8}which satisﬁes
canonical diﬀerential equations [ 63,64]

The boundary conditions are ﬁxed by requiring the ab-

of our partial wave expansion. The partial wave co-
eﬃcients are parameterized in terms of real scattering
phase shifts δℓand inelasticity parameters ηℓ(equiva-
lently, ∆ηℓ≡1−ηℓ). In our basis, an operator with a
multipole number ℓcontributes only to the ℓ’th wave.

The IR divergence and the ¯ µIRdependence in the ﬁrst
two terms of Eq. ( 18) are unobservable [ 66,67] because
they appear multiplicatively in the S matrix and hence
do no aﬀect the physical cross-section. The third term is
a sum of the ﬁnite Feynman diagrams. The last term in
the ﬁrst line of Eq. ( 18) contains the UV singularity in
the single insertion of the background metric at O(G3)
and the relevant tree-level worldline counterterms (Love
numbers), displayedin Eq.( 20). Since therearenodiver-
gences in the P-wave at O(G3),C1,ω0is just a constant.
In contrast, C0,ω2(¯µ) is a running coupling, which we use
to renormalize the S-wave divergence in the MS scheme.
Itsβ-function is given by
dC0,ω2(¯µ)
dln ¯µ=−4π(2Gm)3. (22)
It is convenient now to absorb all local counterterms into
the real part of internal multipole moments deﬁned in
Eq. (3). Then we can write down a uniﬁed expression for
the two-loop beta function of all scalar tidal operators:
dFℓ(ω; ¯µ)
dln ¯µ=−(2Gmω)2/bracketleftbigg4νℓ

πFℓ(ω; ¯µ)+8πGmδ [0ℓ]/bracketrightbigg
,
(23)
whereδ[ℓℓ′]is the Kronecker delta. The ﬁrst term in the
r.h.s. above describes the running of self-induced tidal
eﬀects, both conservative and dissipative. The EFT ele-
gantly explains this homogeneity: both eﬀects stem from
the correlators /an}bracketle{tQQ/an}bracketri}htthat pick up the same running from
gravitational2-loopdiagramsattachedtothem. Interest-
ingly, the two-loop beta function is proportional to the
one-loop (2PM) phase shift νℓ
2. This can be explained by
the fact that unitarity ﬁxes the coeﬃcient of the ln ω2in
the dressed correlator in terms of the lower-PM ampli-
tude. In contrast, the rightmost term above is a univer-
salconservative contribution which arises from the PM
expansion. The EFT dictates that this part does not
depend on the nature of the compact object.
Matching to black holes. – Let us compare our EFT
phase shift ( 18) with the analytic expression known from5
BHPT in GR [ 38–44,46]. Truncating this expression at
3PMandintroducingtheSchwarzschildradius rs= 2Gm
as the only scale of static black holes, we ﬁnd

As a ﬁrst check of our calculation, we verify that in-
frared divergences in the EFT match those in the full
theory by choosing ¯ µIR= 1/rs. A second important ob-
servation is that the coeﬃcients in front of the UV logs
in the EFT expression ( 20) match those in GR ( 25,27),
as expected by consistency of the EFT. Matching the P-
wave (ℓ= 1) phase shift we obtain the vanishing of the
scalar dipole static Love number, C1,ω0= 0, consistent
with previous results [ 22–24,28]. This is the ﬁrst rig-
orous on-shell proof of the vanishing of Love numbers.
The contribution of the dipolar dynamical Love number
C1,ω2in Eq. (20) shifts to 5PM for black holes, which is
beyond the scope of our work.

shift is known, the physical interpretation of individual
terms in it, especially logarithms, is diﬃcult. In con-
trast, the EFT clearly classiﬁes all logs into IR and UV
ones, and also distinguishes universal and self-induced
tidal eﬀects. Finally, the EFT nicely explains the appar-
ent conspiracy between coeﬃcients in front of dissipative
logs and conservative phase shifts at lower loop orders.
Generalizations.– Our method can be used to study
tides in higher spacetime dimension D. For general D,
it is trivial to match ﬁnite-size couplings because tidal
eﬀects do not scale as integer powers of G[22,23,28,29].
UVdivergencesandnon-trivialmatchingconditionsarise
if 2ℓ/(D−3) is integer. In particular, in D= 5 we ﬁnd
divergences for both S and P-waves,

The beta-function for C1,ω0matches the known results
from GR [ 22,23,28]. The running part of the dynam-
ical LNC0,ω2is obtained for the ﬁrst time. Since full
BHPT results are not readily available in the literature
forD= 5, we leave a complete matching for future work.
Conclusions.– We have presented a new systematic
framework to match tidal responses of compact objects
from probability amplitudes of massless waves to scatter
oﬀ these objects. Our method is free of gauge depen-
dence and ﬁeld-redeﬁnition ambiguities that plague the
standard oﬀ-shell matching techniques commonly used
to extract tidal eﬀects (Love numbers). We illustrated
the power of our approach by calculating a full 3PM am-
plitude for a scalar ﬁeld to quasi-elastically scatter oﬀ a
generic compact object. Our technique leads to rich im-
plications for black holes, for which analytic GR results
are available for comparison. In particular, we clariﬁed
the IR and UV origin of diﬀerent terms in the GR ex-
pressions. Overall, our ﬁndings presented here give new
insights into the form of gravitational scattering ampli-
tudes, and serve as a prototype for the upcoming spin-2
Raman scattering calculations.
Note added : The previous version of this paper con-
tained an error in the constant part of the S-wave 3PM6
dynamical Love number. The error originated from a
subtlety in evaluating the S-wave phase shift. In partic-
ular, formulas for general ℓcannot be trusted at integer
ℓ < ℓ∗ifℓ∗appears as a Regge pole, even if there is no
singularity in the partial wave at such integer ℓ. In our
case, there is a Regge pole at ℓ∗= 1/2, invalidating the
naive analytic continuation of the general- ℓformula to
ℓ= 0. This gave rise to a discrepancy between the (mis-
takenly) analytically-continued general- ℓresult toℓ= 0
and the direct calculation of the S-wave phase shift. We
are grateful to M. Correia, S. Caron-Huot, G. Isabella,
and M. Solon for pointing out a disagreement with theirupcoming work, which lead us to identify this error.

Supplemental Material
1. PARTIAL WAVE EXPANSION
In this appendix, we derive the partial wave expansion for the quan tum amplitude of scalar ﬁelds scattering oﬀ a
compact object. The four-dimensional partial waves contain infr ared divergences which we regularize by working in
D= 4−2ǫIRdimensions, i.e., we will work with the analog of ( 17) in general dimension, D.
We consider the following scalar 1-to-1 S-matrix on the background sourced by the compact object
/an}bracketle{tk2|(S−1)|k1/an}bracketri}ht=iM(k1→k2)·(2π)δ(u·(k1+k2)). (S1)
The direction of kitransverse to uis denoted by ni. By projecting the above amplitude onto the traceless symmetric
irreducible representation ρof SO(D−1) using the projector |L/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tL|, we obtain the partial wave expansion

ℓ(ηℓe2iδℓ−1)/an}bracketle{tn2|L/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tL|n1/an}bracketri}ht. (S2)
The vertex /an}bracketle{tL|n/an}bracketri}htcan be ﬁxed by the SO( D−1) symmetry up to a kinematic normalization N(ω)

To determine the normalization, we recall that the normalization of o ne-particle state is /an}bracketle{tk2|k1/an}bracketri}ht=
2ω(2π)D−1δD−1(k1−k2), thereby yielding the following completeness relation

Given that the dimension of the irreducible representation can be de termined by the group trace of the projector
Tr|L/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tL|, we obtain the following relation
dimρ=(2ℓ+D−3)Γ(D+ℓ−3)
Γ(D−2)Γ(ℓ+1)= Tr|L/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tL|=(2ω)D−3VolSD−2

The above relation then completely determines the normalization in th e partial wave expansion, and we end up with

As already mentioned, the amplitude contains both infrared diverge nces and singularities in the forward limit,
which are regularized by working in D= 4−2ǫIRdimensions1. The partial wave transform of power-law forward
singularities can be obtained for general ℓvia the inversion formula

Some care is required when performing the partial wave expansion o f logarithmically divergent terms, e.g. ln( z−1).
More concretely, the limit ǫIR→0 does not commute with the forward limit z→1. Fortunately, the diﬀerential
equations in Eq. ( 15), provide a systematic way of expanding around the forward limit wit h ﬁxedǫIR, with the leading
behavior/vectorf∼xǫIRA0∼(z−1)ǫIRA0.
The aboveexpressionis to be used in conjunction with the analytical continuationof ℓ[S22,S28,S46,S47,S68] valid
for suﬃciently largeorbital numbersthanks to the unitarity. This c an be seen from the Froissart-Gribovformula [ S69],
which not only proves the analyticity for ℓ≥ℓ0, but also provides a shortcut to compute the phase shift from the
t-channel cut (where t= 2ω2(z−1)) of the amplitudes

The Froissart-Gribov representation is well suited for an expansio n around large ℓ, which is dominated by the lower
limit of the integral, i.e., z→1, and hence conveniently computed given the forward expansion o f the amplitude.
Furthermore, as it only features the discontinuity in zof the amplitude, the computation of the general- ℓpartial
waves is greatly simpliﬁed. For instance, out of the eight master inte grals in Eq. ( 14) only the four in the second
line are non-analytic in the scattering angle, and hence contribute t o the discontinuity. The restriction ℓ≥ℓ0arises
from the underlying Regge limit of the amplitudes in the complex t-plane, characterized by lim |t|→∞|M|<|t|ℓ0.
This restriction appears during the contour deformation of the am plitudes in the complex t-plane when deriving the
Froissart-Gribov formula, because it is necessary for the integra nd at complex inﬁnity to decay suﬃciently fast so
that it can be dropped given Q(D)
ℓ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
z→∞∼1/zℓ+D−3(see e.g. [ S70]). Let us note that the Froissart-Gribov formula
produces spurious poles for physical ℓ∈NatO(G2ℓ+3). These are similar to the spurious poles encountered in GR
calculations of static Love numbers or higher dimensional Schwarzs child black holes in [ S22] and dynamical Love
numbers of Kerr black holes in [ S24]. In that case, we use the partial wave transformation for ﬁxed in tegerℓ.
2. PARTIAL WAVE AMPLITUDES FOR GENERAL ℓ-WAVES
