Abstract. We ﬁrst survey the current state of the art concerning the dyn amical properties
of multidimensional continued fraction algorithms deﬁned dynamically as piecewise fractional
maps and compare them with algorithms based on lattice reduc tion. We discuss their con-
vergence properties and the quality of the rational approxi mation, and stress the interest for
these algorithms to be obtained by iterating dynamical syst ems. We then focus on an algorithm
based on the classical Jacobi–Perron algorithm involving t he nearest integer part. We describe
its Markov properties and we suggest a possible procedure fo r proving the existence of a ﬁnite
ergodic invariant measure absolutely continuous with resp ect to Lebesgue measure.

The usual regular continued fractions are known to provide e xtremely good (and even the best)
rational approximations for positive real numbers [Khi63, Cas72]. The situation is more complic-
ated in higher dimension. Indeed, there is no canonical exte nsion of regular continued fractions
to higher dimensions (see Section 4.1), and the zoology of ex isting algorithms is particularly rich
(see Section 4.5 as an illustration). The main advantage of m ost classical (unimodular) continued
fractions is that they can be expressed as dynamical systems whose ergodic study has already
been well understood (such as described in Section 4.4). Erg odic theory allows a precise descrip-
tion of the long-range statistical properties of the expans ions that are produced e.g. their mean
behavior. Indeed, ergodic theory extends basic laws of larg e numbers in probability by dropping
the assumption of intertemporal independence. Thus, it rel ates spatial averages/integraltext
Xf dµ to time
averages1
n/summationtext
0≤i<nf◦Tialong trajectories, and the system has the same behavior whe n averaged
over time as averaged over the whole space.
However, the main disadvantage of these algorithms relies, ﬁrstly, in the fact that the behavior
of the continued fraction expansion of a given d-tuple αcan be diﬃcult to grasp (it might not
behave in a generic way), and secondly, in the quality of the r ational approximations that are
produced. Indeed, the convergence of multidimensional con tinued fractions is governed by their
(ﬁrst and second) Lyapounov exponents (see [Lag93]), which describe the asymptotic behavior of
the singular values of large products of matrices, under the ergodic hypothesis. More precisely,
their approximation exponent can be expressed as 1 −λ2
λ1according to [Lag93] ( λ1andλ2being the
two largest Lyapunov exponents of the associated dynamical system). It has to be compared with
Dirichlet’s exponent 1+1 /d(see Theorem 3.1 in Section 3.1). However, there is numerica l evidence
[BST21] that the second Lyapunov exponent is not even negati ve in higher dimensions for most
classical algorithms such as the Jacobi–Perron [Ber71, Per 07, Sch73], Brun [Bru19, Bru20, Bru58]
or Selmer [Sel61] algorithms, which prevents strong conver gence of these algorithms. In a nutshell,
strong (resp. weak) convergence refers to the convergence o f quantities of the type |||q(n)α|||
(resp., ||α−p(n)/q(n)||). These algorithms converge weakly usually, but they fail t o have strong
convergence (see Section 3.3 for the deﬁnitions of weak and s trong convergence).
In terms of the quality of rational approximations that are p roduced, there is a second strategy
which relies on lattice reduction, where rational approxim ations are obtained by exhibiting short
vectors in a lattice attached to some given d-tuple α. Lattice reduction algorithms aim to ﬁnd
reduced basis of Euclidean lattices, formed by short and alm ost orthogonal vectors. The most
celebrated one is the LLL algorithm, designed by Lenstra, Le nstra and Lovász in 1982 [LLL82].
It relies heavily on the use of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalizat ion. Its overall algorithmic structure
is simple and yet, its general probabilistic behavior is far from being understood; this includes
the gap between its practical performances and its proved wo rst-case estimates. Hence, although
ﬁnding rational approximations work quite well in practice , the average behavior of such a strategy
is not well understood. In particular, the lack of a descript ion of reduction algorithms as dynamical
systems prevents the use of tools from ergodic theory.
In the expository part of the paper, we focus on the two main cl asses of algorithms that
produce rational approximations as discussed above. The ﬁr st type of algorithms can be expressed
via dynamical systems deﬁned on a compact set (usually of the form [0 ,1]d). Such an algorithm
associates with some given vector an inﬁnite sequence of mat rices, and one can consider the quality
of convergence of this product of matrices. The most classic al examples of such algorithms are
the Jacobi–Perron [Ber71, HJ68, Per07, Sch73], the Brun [Br u19, Bru20, Bru58], or the Selmer
algorithms (the last of which is conjugate on the absorbing s implex to Mönkemeyer’s algorithm
[M¨54, Pan08]). They are described e.g. in [Bre81, Sch00, Lag93 ]. The second type of algorithm
is based on lattice reduction algorithms, such as the LLL alg orithm (see Section 5). We focus on
these two families since they share as a common feature the fa ct that they rely on a basis of the
integer lattice Zd.
We then illustrate in Section 7 the dynamical approach with t he ergodic study of a version of
the Jacobi–Perron algorithm based on the use of the nearest i nteger part. One motivation for
studying the nearest integer Jacobi–Perron algorithm is to conﬁrm the idea that working with
the nearest integer part improves the quality of continued f raction algorithms, such as indicatedRATIONAL APPROXIMATIONS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINUED F RACTIONS 3
numerically by the experimental results from Steiner [Ste] (see Section 7.2). The partial quotients
produced by the usual Jacobi–Perron algorithm satisfy a sim ple Markovian rule. In the case of
the nearest integer Jacobi–Perron algorithm the descripti on of the admissible sequences of digits
is much more involved. Hence, a simple modiﬁcation – such as c hanging the choice of the integer
part – leads to much more delicate conditions for the descrip tion of the algorithm. As a ﬁrst step
toward a theoretical conﬁrmation of the above-mentioned es timates, we prove the existence of a
Markov partition for the nearest integer Jacobi–Perron alg orithm and suggest a possible procedure
for proving the existence of a ﬁnite ergodic invariant measu re absolutely continuous with respect
to Lebesgue measure.
Let us sketch the contents of this paper. Section 2 recalls ba sic notions concerning classical
continued fractions. We present their main properties that we will use as a guideline for possible
generalizations to higher-dimensional case. We then focus in Section 3 on the two main strategies
that can be used for producing rational approximations in an eﬀective way. Section 4 focuses on
the classical dynamical unimodular continued fraction alg orithms. Algorithms based on the lattice
reduction algorithms and homogeneous dynamics are conside red in Section 5. We brieﬂy discuss
applications and possible ways to improve algorithms in Sec tion 6. Lastly, in Section 7 we focus
on the nearest integer Jacobi–Perron algorithm. We describ e its associated Markov partition and
provide a strategy for proving the existence of an absolutel y continuous invariant measure.

2.Continued fractions
In this section we brieﬂy recall the main properties of the us ual regular continued fractions.
They will serve us a guideline for the discussion on the highe r-dimensional case. For general
references on continued fractions, see e.g. [Bil78, DK02, H W79, IK02, Khi63]. For any positive
real number α∈[0,1], its continued fraction expansion is
α=1
a1+1
a2+1
a3+...,
where the digits anare positive integers, called partial quotients . The rational numbers pn/qn,
where pn,qnare coprime positive integers deﬁned as
pn
qn=1
a1+1
a2+...+1
an,
are called convergents . The sequence of rational numbers pn/qnapproximates αup to an error of
order 1 /q2
n: one has
|α−pn/qn| ≤1
q2nfor all n.
Dynamically, continued fraction expansions can be obtaine d by applying the Gauss map TG:
[0,1]→[0,1] deﬁned by
TG(0) = 0 and TG(α) ={1/α}ifα/\⌉}atio\slash= 0,
where {·}is the fractional part of a real number. If for an α∈(0,1] we write TG(α) ={1/α}=
1
α− ⌊1
α⌋=1
α−a1, then α=1
a1+TG(α). Now, by setting an=⌊1
Tn−1
G(α)⌋forn≥1, one gets the
digits in the the continued fraction expansion of α.4 V. BERTHÉ, K. DAJANI, C. KALLE, E. KRAWCZYK, H. KURU, AND A. T HEVIS
Note that the Gauss map is closely related to Euclid’s algori thm: starting with two (coprime)
positive integers ℓ(0)andℓ(1)Euclid’s algorithm works by subtracting as often as possibl e the
smallest of both numbers from the largest one (that is, one pe rforms the Euclidean division of the
largest one by the smallest); this yields ℓ(0)=ℓ(1)⌊ℓ(0)
ℓ(1)⌋+ℓ(2),ℓ(1)=ℓ(2)⌊ℓ(1)
ℓ(2)⌋+ℓ(3), etc., until
we reach ℓ(m+1)= 1 = gcd( ℓ(0), ℓ(1)). By setting, for n∈N,α(n)=ℓ(n)
ℓ(n+1)andan=⌊α(n)⌋, one
getsα(n−1)=an−1+1
α(n),and
α(0)=ℓ(0)

by using the classical relations between convergents and pa rtial quotients, namely q−1= 0, p−1=

qn+1=an+1qn+qn−1, pn+1=an+1pn+pn−1.
The matrix/bracketleftbigg
pn−1pn
qn−1qn/bracketrightbigg
is a square matrix with integer entries that has determinant of absolute
value 1, which is to say that it is unimodular . We denote the set of unimodular matrices by
GL(d,Z). (We also use the following standard notations: GL( d,R) stands for the set of d×d
invertible matrices with real entries, SL(d,N) stands for the set of d×dmatrices of determinant
1 with non-negative integer coeﬃcients.) Note that the entr ies of this matrix are even positive.
To understand the convergence of such a sequence of matrices one can use generalizations of the
Perron–Frobenius theorem, such as Theorem 3.2 below.
Dynamically, the Gauss map TGgoes with the map
(2.1) AG: [0,1]→GL(2 ,N), α/ma√sto→/bracketleftbigg0 1
1⌊1/α⌋/bracketrightbigg
.
Such a map is called a cocycle in the terminology of (random) dynamical systems (see e.g. [ Arn95,
Arn98a, Via14]). Let us set A(n):=A(Tn
G)(α) for all positive n. The line directed by the vector
(α,1) inR2belongs to the sequence of nested cones A(1)· · ·A(n)R2
+,i.e.,
(α,1)∈/intersectiondisplay
nA(1)· · ·A(n)R2
+=/intersectiondisplay
nA(TG)(α)· · ·A(Tn
G)(α)R2
+.
One has even more: this sequence of nested cones converges to the line directed by ( α,1). The
convergence is said to be weak if the angles between the (column) vectors of the product mat rices
A(1)· · ·A(n)tend to 0 (as n→ ∞ ), and strong if the distances between the vectors tend to 0.
Continued fractions can thus be seen as producing dynamical ly inﬁnite convergent sequences of
unimodular matrices. We revisit the notions of convergence of inﬁnite products of matrices in
Section 3.3 in more detail.
3.On simultaneous approximation
This section is devoted to simultaneous rational approxima tions. In Section 3.1 we ﬁrst recall
Dirichlet’s theorem. We then describe in Section 3.2 the two main strategies for producing such
approximations that we consider in this survey. We focus on t he quality of approximations in
Section 3.3.RATIONAL APPROXIMATIONS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINUED F RACTIONS 5
3.1.Dirichlet’s bound. Let us recall Dirichlet’s theorem; it can be obtained as a dir ect applic-
ation of the pigeonhole principle (see e.g. [HW79]) or of Min kowski’s ﬁrst theorem.
Theorem 3.1 (Dirichlet’s theorem) .For any (α1,· · ·, αd)∈Rdand any Q, there exists a positive
integer qwith q≤Qdand integers pisuch that
max
1≤i≤d|qαi−pi|<1

Theorem 3.1 immediately implies that for any ( α1,· · ·, αd)∈Rdthe system of inequalities/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglepi
q−αi/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle<1
q1+1
d,fori= 1,2, . . . , d,
admits inﬁnitely many integer solutions ( p1, . . . , p d, q).
The exponent 1 + 1 /dis optimal as shown in [Per21], see also [Cas72, Sch96a]. The Dirich-
let’s theorem provides the existence of “good” approximati ons. One can thus make an exhaustive
search, though this is not an eﬃcient algorithmic method. Se e [NV10, Chapter 6] for a dis-
cussion on eﬀective methods. See also [Lag85], where the com putational complexity concerning
simultaneous Diophantine approximations is investigated . When the dimension dis ﬁxed, [Lag85]
gives algorithms which, for a given N, ﬁnd a good rational approximation with denominator
1≤q≤Nwith respect to a speciﬁed accuracy, or which ﬁnd all best app roximations in [1 ,· · ·, N]
in polynomial-time (using methods based on the LLL algorith m). Note that the following problem
is proved to be NP-hard: for a given vector α∈Qd, positive integer Nand accuracy s1/s2, is there
an integer Qwith 1 ≤Q≤Nsuch that |||Qα||| ≤ s1/s2? (The distance to the nearest integer
is expressed here with respect to the supremum norm.) In a sim ilar ﬂavor, see also [HJLS89]
concerning the problem of ﬁnding integer relations, and [BJ MadH88].
Continued fractions are known to provide good (and even the b est) rational approximations of a
given real number αin [0,1] (see e.g. [Cas72, Khi63]). One would desire to have simila r algorithms
yielding good rational approximations with the same denomi nator of d-tuples of positive real
numbers. That is, for a given α= (α1,· · ·, αd)∈[0,1]d, one looks for sequences of positive
integers ( qn)nand positive integer d-tuples p(n)= (p(n)
1,· · ·, p(n)
d)nsuch that
limp(n)
i/qn=αi, i= 1,· · ·, d
with a good quality of rational approximation of α. Geometrically, this corresponds to looking
for approximations of a line in Rd+1by points in Zd+1. Dual problems consist of looking for small
values of linear forms and small linear relations.
More precisely, given a norm || · ||onRd, let||| · ||| stand for the distance to the nearest integer.
The usual norms that are considered are the supremum and the E uclidean norm. The quality
of the approximation is measured by1
q(n)|||q(n)α|||, to be compared with Dirichlet’s bound, i.e.,
|||q(n)α|||has to be compared with ( q(n))−1/d. One can thus consider the approximation exponent
lim sup
n−log/⌊ar⌈⌊lα−p(n)

q(n)
i/⌊ar⌈⌊l

and compare it to the Dirchlet’s bound 1 + 1 /d.
3.2.How to produce rational approximations. We focus here on two main approaches for
producing rational approximations. The ﬁrst one is based on the generation of inﬁnite convergent
sequences of matrices obtained dynamically by iteration of a map acting on a compact space,
as illustrated with the Gauss map TGfor usual continued fractions in Section 2. This will be
discussed further in Section 4. The second one is based on the existence of small vectors picked
in well chosen lattices; we will discuss it in Section 5.
The ﬁrst strategy associates with some element α= (α1,· · ·, αd)∈Rda sequence of square
matrices ( A(n))n∈Nof size d+1 with integer entries. It can be produced for instance via a dynamical
system ( X, T) with a map Aas follows (see also 2.1):
(3.1) T:X→X, A :X→GL(d+ 1,Z),andA(n)=A(Tn(x)).6 V. BERTHÉ, K. DAJANI, C. KALLE, E. KRAWCZYK, H. KURU, AND A. T HEVIS
If the matrices belong to GL(d+ 1,Z), then the corresponding algorithm is called unimodular .
Matrices A(n)play the role of partial quotients and the product matrices A(1)· · ·A(n)produce
convergents. Convergents aim at providing Diophantine app roximations (via their column vectors)
of the direction ( α,1). We write
(3.2) A(1)· · ·A(n)=

p(n)
d,1· · · p(n)

.
The last element of each column of A(1)· · ·A(n)is a denominator for the associated simultaneous
rational approximation. The rows of the convergent matrice s are meant to provide the numerators
of the simultaneous approximations, i.e., one considers
/parenleftigg
p(n)
j,1
q(n)
j,· · ·,p(n)
j,d
q(n)

.
The integers q(n)
jplay the role of nth convergents, and the vector ( p(n)
j,1,· · ·, p(n)
j,d, q(n)
j) is called an
nth convergent vector. The convergence of these matrices mea ns that they contract in the direction
of the vector ( α,1). We discuss more precisely their convergence in Section 3 .3 by considering
products A(1)· · ·A(n)asngoes to inﬁnity.
We now describe the second approach based on the existence of small vectors in well chosen
lattices, as described in the seminal paper [LLL82]. This ap proach yields a very fruitful compromise
between the quality of approximation (a good approximation is deduced from a small vector) and
the eﬃciency (this small vector is obtained in polynomial ti me). Let α= (α1,· · ·, αd)∈Rdbe
a vector to approximate. One works here again in a d+ 1-dimensional space, by introducing a
one-parameter family of lattices (Λ t)t>0with positive parameter ttending to 0. More precisely,
let Λ tbe the lattice generated by the columns of the matrix
Mt:=
1 0 · · · 0−α1
0 1 · · · 0−α2
...............
0 0 · · · 1−αd
0 0 · · · 0 t
.
Note that det( Mt) =t, hence, the lattice Λ tchanges at each step of the algorithm. Let us stress
the fact that this strategy diﬀers from the previous one wher e, in the unimodular case, one works
with bases of the ﬁxed lattice Zd+1. We will take tsmall, the parameter Qof Dirichlet’s theorem
being connected to tas follows: Q=t−1
d+1.
One of the main features of the LLL algorithm is that it produc es in polynomial time a non-zero
vector b= (b1,· · ·, bd+1) of the lattice Λ tsuch that
(3.3) ||b||2≤2d/4det(Mt)1/(d+1)= 2d/4t1/(d+1).
Note that the geometry of numbers, and more precisely Minkow ski’s ﬁrst theorem, guarantees the
existence of a “small” non-zero vector x∈Λt, i.e., such that
(3.4) ||x|| ≤/radicalbig
(d+ 1)( d+ 5)/4 (vol(Λ t))1/(d+1)=/radicalbig
(d+ 1)( d+ 5)/4t1/(d+1).
Let ( ei)i=1,...,d +1stand for the canonical basis of Zd+1. There exist integers p1, . . . , p d, qsuch
that
b=p1e1+p2e2+· · ·+pded+q(−α1e1− · · · − αded+ted+1)
= (p1−qα1)e1+· · ·+ (pd−qαd)ed+qted+1.
One deduces from (3.3) that for all 1 ≤i≤d
|pi−αiq| ≤2d/4t1/(d+1)RATIONAL APPROXIMATIONS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINUED F RACTIONS 7
and
qt≤2d/4t1/(d+1),i.e., t1
d+1≤21/4
q1/d.
For all i, we deduce that
|pi−αiq| ≤2(d+1)/4
q1/d,
with
|q| ≤2d/4t−d/(d+1)= 2d/4Qd.
The quality of approximation is the quality that is expected (according to Dirichlet’s theorem)
up to a multiplicative factor 2(d+1)/4which depends exponentially on the dimension. We could
have used the inequality (3.4) which would have given a diﬀer ent multiplicative factor, but the
same quality ( q1/d). Nevertheless, the interest of a lattice reduction algori thm such as the LLL
algorithm is that the small vector that is used is found in pol ynomial time.
For a given t >0, the smallest vector of the lattice Λ tproduces the best approximation. One
can ask whether it is possible to devise a continued fraction algorithm from this. Note that one has
to recompute everything from the beginning when one changes t. This will be discussed further
in Section 5. Algorithms deﬁned dynamically with maps such i n (3.1) are on the contrary called
memory-less (see Section 4).
3.3.Convergence and Lyapunov exponents. One important feature of the ﬁrst strategy
(based on the generation of inﬁnite products of matrices) fr om Section 3.2 is that we are still
able to measure the quality of approximation that is produce d in view of Dirichlet’s theorem. To
do this, we need to measure the quality of convergence of inﬁn ite products of matrices; this can be
done using Lyapunov exponents. One can either measure the co nvergence of a given product of
matrices or consider the generic behavior of products of mat rices generated by a dynamical system.
Lyapunov exponents allow, among other things, the descript ion of the growth of the logarithm of
the angles between column vectors of products of matrices M0· · ·Mn.
We state now the deﬁnitions concerning convergence. The nor m/⌊ar⌈⌊l · /⌊ar⌈⌊l refers to the Euclidean
norm and the distance d below refers to the usual associated d istance of a point to a line. Let
M= (Mn)n∈Nbe a sequence of square matrices of size dand let ℓ∈Rd. Let ( e1,· · ·,ed) stand
for the canonical basis of Rd. We say that Misweakly convergent toℓif
lim
n→+∞d/parenleftbiggM0· · ·Mn−1ei
/⌊ar⌈⌊lM0· · ·Mn−1ei/⌊ar⌈⌊l,ℓ/parenrightbigg
= 0 for all i∈ {1, . . . , d }.
We say that Misstrongly convergent toℓif
lim
n→+∞d(M0· · ·Mn−1ei,Rℓ) = 0 for all i∈ {1, . . . , d }.
Lastly, we say that Misexponentially convergent toℓif there exist C, γ > 0 such that
d(M0· · ·Mn−1ei,Rℓ)< Ce−γfor all n∈Nand for all i∈ {1, . . . , d }.
Exponential convergence is a ﬁrst step in the direction of go od rational approximations. The
constant γthen has to be compared with Dirichlet’s bound.
Theorem 3.2 below gives a suﬃcient condition for the sequenc e of cones M0· · ·MnRd
+to nest
down to a single line as ntends to inﬁnity for square matrices Miwith non-negative entries.
It can be seen as a generalization of the classical Perron–Fr obenius theorem. This statement is
particularly useful in the present context since multidime nensional continued fraction algorithms
often generate non-negative matrices. Hence, weak converg ence is usually not an issue for multi-
dimensional continued fraction algorithms.

Let us now focus on strong convergence by ﬁrst recalling the d eﬁnition of the Lyapunov ex-
ponents of a sequence of matrices. For a matrix Min GL( d,R), the singular values δ1, . . . , δ d
are the eigenvalues of the matrix (tMM )1/2. Let us order these (positive and real) values as
δ1≥δ2≥ · · · ≥ δd. Given a sequence M= (Mn)n∈Nof matrices in GL(d ,R), the i-th Lyapunov
exponent θiis then deﬁned as the limit
θi:= lim
n→∞1
nlog(δi(n)),
if this limit exists, with δi(n) being the i-th singular value of M0· · ·Mn−1. The Lyapunov expo-
nents can also be deﬁned recursively using exterior powers ( see for example [Arn98a, Proposition
3.2.7]) by
θ1+· · ·+θk= lim
n→∞1
nlog/⌊ar⌈⌊l∧kM0· · ·Mn−1/⌊ar⌈⌊l, k = 1, . . . , d,
provided that the limit exists. One has θ1≥θ2≥ · · · ≥ θd. A suﬃcient condition for strong
convergence can then be stated as follows (see [Arn98a, Prop osition 3.4.2 (ii)] and [ABM+23]):
LetM= (Mn)n∈Nbe a sequence of non-negative matrices in GL( d,N) for which the Lyapunov
exponents exist; if Msatisﬁes the growth condition lim supn→∞1
nlog/⌊ar⌈⌊lMn/⌊ar⌈⌊l ≤0 together with the
condition θ1>0> θ 2, then strong convergence holds.
Lyapunov exponents can be also deﬁned for random products of matrices, where the randomness
can be provided by putting some distribution on the set of mat rices or by iterating measurable
dynamical systems that produce matrices with a cocyle map su ch as in (2.1). The ﬁrst results in
this direction were stated for sequences of independent ran dom matrices with a given distribution
function, with the Furstenberg–Kesten theorem (see [FK60, Fur63]); these results have then been
reﬁned via Kingman’s subadditive ergodic theorem and lastl y via Oseledets’ multiplicative ergodic
theorem (see for instance [Arn95, Arn98a, Via14]) proving t hat the limits (involved in the deﬁnition
of Lyapunov exponents) exist almost surely and take almost e verywhere the same value.
Let us give a ﬂavour of such results. We will come back to this a lso in Section 4.4. We
ﬁrst recall a few elements from ergodic theory. The (left) shift Sacts on a sequence ( Mn)n∈N
asS((Mn)n) = ( Mn+1)n(i.e. the ﬁrst term of the sequence ( Mn)nis deleted). Let Mbe a
ﬁnite set of matrices in GL( d,Z).LetD⊂ MNbe a closed shift-invariant subset of GL( d,Z)N.
A probability measure νonDis called invariant if ν(S−1A) =ν(A) for every measurable set
A⊂D. An invariant probability measure on Disergodic if any shift-invariant measurable set
has either measure 0 or 1. We have seen (see (3.1)) that such a s et of matrices can be obtained
by considering a measurable map Tacting on some compact metric space and a measurable map
A:X→GL(d,Z).The sequences of matrices are then of the form A(Tn(x)) and one studies the
existence and the almost everywhere behavior of limits of th e form

4.Higher-dimensional dynamical continued fractions
We now focus on multidimensional continued fraction algori thms. Their non-canonicity is
discussed in Section 4.1. Section 4.2 recalls what is usuall y expected from a continued fraction
algorithm. We then focus on algorithms obtained by iteratio n of a dynamical system, which yieldRATIONAL APPROXIMATIONS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINUED F RACTIONS 9
the so-called memory-less algorithms. The interest of thei r dynamical description is highlighted
in Section 4.4. Lastly, we give examples of such algorithms i n Section 4.5.
4.1.Non-canonicity in higher dimension. The aim of this section is to present several facts
sustaining the claim that there is no canonical multidimens ional continued fractions algorithm.
Firstly, (usual) continued fractions rely on Euclid’s algo rithm: starting with two numbers, one
subtracts the smallest from the largest (see Section 4). If w e start with at least three numbers,
it is not clear how to decide which operation has to be perform ed, hence the diversity of existing
generalizations. For instance, Brun’s algorithm can be des cribed as subtracting the second largest
entry from the largest one. See Section 4.5 for more details.
Moreover, the speciﬁc algebraic structure of SL(2,N) plays an important role for one-dimensional
continued fractions algorithms. Indeed, the matrices prod uced in the case of usual continued frac-
tions are unimodular matrices with non-negative integer co eﬃcients (see Section 2). The algebraic
structure of SL(2,N) is particularly simple: SL(2,N) is a free and ﬁnitely generated monoid; it
admits
(4.1)/bracketleftbigg
1 0
1 1/bracketrightbigg
and/bracketleftbigg
1 1
0 1/bracketrightbigg
as generators; any matrix in SL(2,N) thus admits a unique decomposition in terms of the matrices
given in (4.1). This decomposition is a matricial translati on of Euclid’s algorithm, and the con-
tinued fraction expansion of αcan be recovered from the unique decomposition of matrices
(−1)n/bracketleftbigg
pn+1qn+1
pn qn/bracketrightbigg
, n ≥0
in the free monoid SL(2,N). This explains why most one-dimensional continued fracti on al-
gorithms are closely related.
The situation is completely diﬀerent for SL(3,N) which is not ﬁnitely generated. Consider e.g.
the family of matrices
Mn:=
1 0 n
1n−1 0
1 1 n−1
.
According to [Pyt02, Chap. 12] these matrices are undecompo sable for n≥3: they are not equal
to an even permutation matrix, and, for any pair of matrices A, B ∈SL(3,N) such that Mn=AB,
AorBis an even permutation matrix.
Another approach for generalizing continued fractions cou ld rely on properties of best approx-
imation.
Deﬁnition 4.1.A rational number p/qis said to be a best approximation of a real number αif
every p′/q′with 1 ≤q′≤q,p/q/\⌉}atio\slash=p′/q′satisﬁes
|qα−p|<|q′α−p′|.
Convergents in the continued fraction expansion of αand best approximations are known to
coincide [Cas72, Khi63]. Nevertheless, this notion is not s o satisfying for deﬁning continued frac-
tions in higher dimensions as stressed in [Lag82a, Lag82b]. Firstly, best approximations depend
on the choice of a norm [Lag82a], and secondly, the unimodula rity property is lost. More precisely,
one has the following.
Deﬁnition 4.2.Letα∈[0,1]d. Let || · || be a given norm in Rdand let ||| · ||| denote the distance
to the nearest integer. The sequence of best approximations ofαwith respect to the norm || · || is
deﬁned as the increasing sequence of non-negative integers (q(n))n∈Nsuch that |||q(n)α|||<|||qα|||
for any qwith 1 ≤q < q(n).
The existence of an inﬁnite sequence of best approximations can be derived in a classic way from
Dirichlet’s theorem or from Minkowski’s ﬁrst theorem. Best approximations fail to be unimodular
[Lag82b]. More precisely, consider the square matrix Mnof size d+ 1 whose rows are given by
successive best approximations vectors vn= (p(n)
1,· · ·, p(n)
d, q(n)) providing |||q(n)α|||. Let Dn10 V. BERTHÉ, K. DAJANI, C. KALLE, E. KRAWCZYK, H. KURU, AND A. THEVIS
stand for the determinant of this matrix. It is proved in [Lag 82b] that for any norm in dimension
d≥2, there exists α∈Rd, with dim Q[1, α1,· · ·, αd] =d+ 1, such that for any positive integer N,
there exists an nfor which Dn=Dn+1=· · ·=Dn+N= 0. Arbitrarily large determinants can
even occur in dimension d= 2 with the supremum norm. For more on best approximations an d
multidimensional continued fractions, see the survey [Che 13]; see also [Mos07] and Section 5.
4.2.What is expected? We brieﬂy recall here the main properties expected from a con tinued
fraction expansion. For a general discussion on the quest fo r suitable higher-dimensional continued
fractions, see [Bre81]. See also [Gra92] for a discussion on their limitations. We already discussed
the fact that a continued fraction algorithm is expected to y ield simultaneous better and better
rational approximations with the same denominator for d-tuples α= (α1,· · ·, αd) in [0 ,1]d, in
an eﬀective way and with a good approximation quality. More p recisely, it has to produce a se-
quence of positive integers ( q(n))nsuch that the distance to the nearest integer |||q(n)α|||converges
exponentially fast to 0 with respect to q(n), and ideally in ( q(n))−1
d(as predicted by Dirichlet’s
theorem).
From an arithmetic viewpoint, a multidimensional continue d fraction algorithm is also expected
to detect linear relations between 1 , α1,· · ·, αd, and to give algebraic characterizations of periodic
expansions. Furthermore, using such an algorithm, one coul d hope to determine fundamental
units (e.g. of a cubic number ﬁeld), and to solve Diophantine equations (as the ones described in
Section 6). The formalism of multidimensional continued fr actions based on the Klein polyhedra
and sails developed in [Arn89, Lac93, Kor94, Arn98b] is well -suited for the detection of periodic
expansions in terms of algebraic number ﬁelds by providing g eneralized Lagrange’s theorem. For
more on the subject and its history, see e.g. [Lac98a, Lac98b ], the references in [Kar09], and the
book [Kar13], which also includes a review of various genera lizations of continued fractions.
Concerning the properties of best approximations, we have s een in Section 4.1 that the sequence
of best approximations (see Deﬁnition 4.2) depends heavily on the chosen norm and that the
associated transformations are no longer unimodular [Lag8 2b, Mos07]. However, it is possible to
use the action of the diagonal ﬂow on the space of unimodular l attices to better understand their
behavior [Lag94, KLDM07, CCa]. See also Section 5.
From a dynamical viewpoint, continued fraction algorithms are also expected to have reasonable
ergodic properties such as the ones described in Section 4.4 . For instance, we would like to have
control over the (almost sure) behaviors concerning the gro wth of the convergents, the distribution
of the partial quotients, or the speed of convergence via Lya punov exponents. Famous examples
of algorithms expressed dynamically as piecewise linear fr actional transformations are the Jacobi–
Perron, Brun or Selmer algorithms. Their description is the object of Sections 4.3 and 4.5 below.
4.3.Dynamical continued fraction algorithms. We recall here the main concepts related to
dynamical continued fraction algorithms, expanding the br ief description from Section 3.2. This
dynamical formalism covers the most classical multidimens ional continued fraction algorithms
discussed in the classical references [Sze70, Bre81, Sch00 ], see [Lag93] for more details. See also
[Lag93] for a description of the most classical multidimens ional continued fraction algorithms
together with the results concerning their Lyapunov expone nts.
We consider here algorithms that produce the sequence of mat rices ( A(n))n∈Nin a dynamical
way. We take mostly a measure-theoretical viewpoint: the al gorithms will be deﬁned almost
everywhere with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [0 ,1]d. We focus on the unimodular case,
since this allows a geometric interpretation in terms of bas es of the integer lattice Zd+1.
LetX⊂[0,1]d. (Usually Xis simply [0 ,1]dbut some algorithms can be also deﬁned on sets
of the form {x= (x1,· · ·, xd)∈[0,1]d|0≤x1≤ · · · ≤ xd≤1}.) Ad-dimensional unimodular

The maps AandTplay the main role in the algorithm; the role played by the map θis minor: it
serves as a renormalization.
The associated continued fraction algorithm consists of iteratively applying the map Tto a
vector α∈X. This yields a sequence of matrices ( A(Tn(α)))n≥1, called the continued fraction
expansion ofα. One has/bracketleftbigg

.
Such an algorithm is said to be ‘without memory’ . Indeed, the (n+ 1)-th step of the algorithm
depends only on the map Tand on the value Tn(α). This is in contrast with the algorithms based
on lattice reduction that we will discuss in Section 5.
In most classical examples of such algorithms the continued fraction map Tis piecewise con-
tinuous, or even a piecewise homography (see Section 4.5). F urther, many of them are positive ,
that is, all the matrices appearing as the images of the map Aare non-negative.
We illustrate this formalism with the regular continued fra ction case. Considering/bracketleftbiggα

one gets

G(α) =|qn−1α−pn−1|,
where pn/qnstands for the n-th convergent of α, and TGstands for the Gauss map. We see with
this example that the map θwhich allows the renormalization with respect to the last co ordinate
(set to 1) is of an arithmetic nature.
We now revisit this formalism more geometrically in terms of lattice bases following [Bre81].
One approximates the vectorial line in Rd+1directed by the non-zero vector ( α,1) by a se-
quence of integer lattice bases ( b(n))n∈NofZd+1, namely the d+ 1 columns of the matrices
A(α)· · ·A(Tn−1(α)). The lattice bases generate cones that are expected to con verge toward the
line directed by ( α,1). Moreover, if the algorithm is positive, then these cones are nested and
(α,1) belongs to the positive cone generated by the vectors b(n)
i,i= 1, . . . , d + 1, i.e.,
(α,1)∈

/summationdisplay
1≤i≤d+1λib(n)
i|λi≥0 for all i= 1,· · ·, d+ 1

.
In fact, (4.2) implies that the coeﬃcients ( λi)1≤i≤d+1are proportional to the vector ( Tn(α),1).
The algorithm thus produces a sequence of bases of the lattic eZd+1that all determine a homo-
geneous cone in Rd+1that contains the ray {λ(α,1)|λ≥0}. This is the viewpoint developed for
instance in [Bre81]; in fact, the algorithms there are desig ned in this way.
We recall that the continued fraction map Tacts on parameters αliving in an ambient d-
dimensional space. In view of what precedes, it is also natur al to start directly with a general line
ℓ= (ℓ1,· · ·, ℓd+1) inRd+1and to have an algorithm with such a line as an input. But then, there is
no canonical way to ‘projectivize’ the algorithm, i.e., to g o from the line ℓto ad-dimensional vector
αworking in a compact set Xon which a dynamical system Tacts. One can set e.g. αi=ℓi/ℓd+1
fori= 1,· · ·, d(e.g. if the line belongs to the positive cone of Rd+1and if ℓd+1is the largest
entry). Usual ways to go from some ℓ∈Rd+1
+to some α∈[0,1]dconsists in setting ℓd+1= 1, and
working with entries ℓi∈[0,1]dfor 1 ≤i≤d, or else, in working with the simplex/summationtextd+1
i=1ℓi= 1,
with ℓi≥0 for all i. See for instance [Sch00] for more details. One can also choo se to work
directly on the projective space P(Rd) by associating with each element [ y1:y2:· · ·:yd−1:yd]
the representative deﬁned by max yi= 1 and by working with projectivizations of matrices in
GL(d,Z). This possibility of having diﬀerent choices for a same pie cewise d+ 1-dimensional linear
map explains the abundance of existing algorithms (as illus trated in Section 4.5).
Let us discuss now the possible steps of the algorithms, i.e. , the operations that can be performed
on the bases together with the choices allowed for partial qu otient matrices A(n). An algorithm is12 V. BERTHÉ, K. DAJANI, C. KALLE, E. KRAWCZYK, H. KURU, AND A. THEVIS
said to be additive if all the matrices belong to a ﬁnite set, i.e., the map Afrom (3.1) takes ﬁnitely
many values. As an illustration, the additive version of the Gauss map is given by the Farey map
x/ma√sto→

x
1−xfor 0 ≤x≤1/2,
1−x
xfor 1/2≤x≤1.
Dynamically, this creates non-trivial changes; indeed, th e Gauss map is known to have a ﬁnite
ergodic invariant measure, which is not the case for the Fare y map.
One convenient way to get an additive algorithm is to restric t the range of the map Ato the
set of elementary and permutation matrices with entries in {0,1}. A matrix is called elementary
if it has 1’s on the diagonal, one entry equal to 1 elsewhere, a nd all other entries equal to 0. In
geometric terms (still following the geometric formalism f rom [Bre81]) the allowed operations on
the bases at each step nare of elementary types (they correspond to integer transve ctions): for
every n, there exist i/\⌉}atio\slash=j(with i, jdepending on n) and c(n)∈Nsuch that
(4.3) b(n+1)
i =b(n)
i+c(n)b(n)
j,b(n+1)
k=b(n)
kfork/\⌉}atio\slash=i.
This restriction is not a severe one and most of the algorithm s discussed in the present survey enter
this framework, by allowing also permutation rules between the vectors. Algorithms for which the
choice of the coeﬃcients i, jandc(n)depend only on the cofactors of ℓwith respect to b(n), i.e.,
the integers a(n)
isuch that
ℓ=a(n)
1b(n)
1+· · ·+a(n)

d+1,
are called vectorial in [Bre81]. They are memory-less algorithms. In particular , with the notation
of (3.1), if, for some αthe matrix A(α) is equal to an elementary matrix, then the entries of
T(α,1) are obtained (modulo the renormalization produced by the map θ) by subtracting an
entry from another one; it is obtained by performing subtrac tions.
The terminologies additive vs. multiplicative or division vs. subtractive algorithm are commonly
used: see e.g. [Bre81] where an algorithm is said to be subtra ctive if c(n)= 1 in (4.3), and additive
ifc(n)is chosen as the maximal possible number allowing the line to stay within the positive cone
generated by the convergent vectors b(n)
ifori= 1, . . . , d . Additive and multiplicative versions
for a same type of rule can lead to very distinct behaviors. Se e for instance [Bre81], where it
is shown that the multiplicative form of Selmer’s algorithm is not able to be accelerated. The
underlying cause of this is the fact that the group of matrice s generated by positive transvections
and permutations is not commutative.
4.4.The eﬀectiveness of ergodic theory. Having an underlying dynamical system oﬀers a
wide range of mathematical tools, including ergodic theory and thermodynamic formalism via
transfer operators. Ergodic theorems describe the limitin g behavior of ergodic sums of the form
1
n/summationtextn−1
k=0f◦Tk. In probabilistic terms, the random variables f◦Tnsatisfy the strong law of large
numbers under the ergodic hypothesis on T. Ergodic sums1
n/summationtextn−1
k=0f◦Tkallow the expression of a
wide set of algorithmic and arithmetic parameters, and ergo dic theorems allow the understanding
of their mean behaviors. Besides ergodic theory, transfer o perators provide a description of the
evolution of probability density functions, by transporti ng the action of the map Tfrom a dynam-
ical system to the densities. If initial conditions ( xi) for trajectories are distributed according to
a probability density function, then the new collection of p oints ( T(xi)) is distributed according
to a new probability density function, obtained by applying a transfer operator.
Ergodic theory has been quite an eﬀective tool in understand ing the typical behavior of vari-
ous expansions of numbers and their quality of approximatio n. To name a few, we mention
β-expansions, Lüroth series and various one and multi-dimen sional continued fractions.
We ﬁrst illustrate it with the Gauss map. For general ergodic aspects of the Gauss map, see
e.g. [Bil78, DK02, EW11]. The statistics of occurrences of p artial quotients in continued fraction
expansions are deduced from the ergodic theorem applied to t he Gauss map, and having an ergodicRATIONAL APPROXIMATIONS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINUED F RACTIONS 13
absolutely continuous invariant measure then provides met ric results that hold almost everywhere
with respect to the Lebesgue measure.
To explain this in more detail, let us recall basic ergodic pr operties of the Gauss map. We endow
the dynamical system ([0 ,1], TG) with a structure of a measure-theoretic dynamical system. A
measure-theoretic dynamical system is deﬁned as a system ( X, T, µ, B), where µis a probability
measure deﬁned on the σ-algebra Bof subsets of X, and T:X→Xis a measurable map which
preserves the measure µ, i.e. µ(T−1(B)) = µ(B) for all B∈ B. In this case one also says that the
measure µisT-invariant . Here, we endow ([0 ,1], TG) with the Gauss measure µGwhich is a Borel
probability measure absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure deﬁned via the
following density function
µG=1
log 2/integraldisplay1
1 +xdx.
One checks that this measure is TG-invariant. The Gauss map is ergodic with respect to the Gauss
measure, that is, every Borel subset Bof [0,1] such that T−1
G(B) =Bhas either zero or full
measure. This implies that almost all orbits are dense in [0 ,1]. Ergodicity yields furthermore the
following striking convergence result. Indeed, measure-t heoretic ergodic dynamical systems satisfy
Birkhoﬀ’s ergodic theorem , also called individual ergodic theorem , which relates spatial means to
temporal means.
Theorem 4.3 (Birkhoﬀ’s ergodic theorem) .Let(X, T, µ, B)be an ergodic measure-theoretic dy-
namical system. Let f∈L1(X,R). Then the sequence (1

For example in the case of continued fractions, using this th eorem one is able to describe the
distribution of the digits.
Theorem 4.4. For a.e. α∈[0,1]the digit joccurs in the continued fraction expansion of αwith
density1
log 2(2 log(1 + j)−logj−log(2 + j)).
One can even show the digits have the mixing property, as well as give a short and elegant
proof of Lévy’s theorem which states that
(4.4) lim

for Lebesgue almost every point x. With the help of a dynamical construction called the nat-
ural extension (which is basically a way to make the dynamics invertible), o ne can describe the
asymptotic behavior of the approximation coeﬃcients
Θn(x) =q2
n|x−pn
qn|.
As an illustration, we mention the ergodic proof of Bosma, Ja ger and Wiedijk ([BJW83]) of the
famous Doeblin-Lenstra conjecture which says that for almo st all xthe limit

n#{1≤j≤n: Θ j(x)≤z},where 0 ≤z≤1,

In [Jag86], Jager used ergodic tools to describe the simulta neous distribution of two consecutive
Θ’s by determining for almost all xthe exact value of
lim
n→∞1
n#{1≤j≤n: Θ j−1(x)≤z1,Θj(x)≤z2},where 0 ≤z1, z2≤1.
As a third example we mention that it can be proven with the hel p of ergodic theory that for
each real irrational number xand each integer n≥1 one has
(4.6) min(Θ n−1,Θn,Θn+1)<1/radicalig

and
(4.7) max(Θ n−1,Θn,Θn+1)>1/radicalig

For a generalization of these results in the setting of best a pproximations, see [CCb, CCa], and
also Section 5. Inequality (4.6) is a generalization of a res ult by Borel [Bor03], which states that
min(Θ n−1,Θn,Θn+1)<1√
5.
A great number of people independently found (4.6), see for e xample [Obr50, BM66, Sen60].
Inequality (4.7) is due to Tong [Ton83]. In fact, ergodic the oretic methods yield easy proofs of
generalizations of a great number of classical results by Fu jiwara, Segre and others like LeVeque,
Szüzs, and Segre; see [JK89, DK02] for more results and detai ls.
In a diﬀerent direction, ergodic theoretic methods can also be used to prove (generalizations of)
Lochs’ theorem which compares the amount of information giv en by the digits of diﬀerent types
of number expansions. The original statement of Lochs [Loc6 4] compared the regular continued
fraction digits to decimal digits. For an x∈(0,1) let ( ak)k≥1denote its regular continued fraction
digits and ( dk)k≥1its decimal digits and for each n≥1 let mn(x) denote the largest number
of digits akthat can be determined from knowing d1, . . . , d n. Then Lochs proved the following
statement.
Theorem 4.5. For a.e. x∈(0,1),limn→∞mn(x)
n=6 log 2 log 10
π2 .
See [LW08, BI08] for similar results for other types of expan sions. Lochs’ theorem was placed
in a dynamical setting in [BDK99] and developed further in [D F01]. It became apparent that the
number6 log 2 log 10
π2 is related to the measure theoretic entropies h(TG) =π2
6 log 2andh(T10) = log 10
of the transformations TGandT10(x) = 10 x(mod 1) that generate regular continued fractions and
decimal expansions, respectively. Later Lochs’ theorem wa s extended and generalised in several
directions, e.g. in [KVZ22] for random dynamical systems an d in [BCRS22] to include systems
with zero entropy.
Let us consider now the case of multidimensional continued f raction algorithms. For a general
description of their ergodic properties, see [Sch00]. A ﬁrs t step in the ergodic study of a continued
fraction algorithm consists of proving the existence of the so-called a.c.i.m (absolutely continu-
ous invariant measure). Note that a very eﬃcient way to ﬁnd a. c.i.m. ’s for continued fraction
transformations is via the natural extensions; see e.g. [AN 93, AL18, AS19, EINN19, KLMM20].
Let us now consider more closely convergence properties fro m a dynamical viewpoint. Lyapounov
exponents of classical algorithms such as the Jacobi–Perro n algorithm or the Brun algorithm have
been thoroughly studied in [Bro96, BAG01]; see also [FS21] f or the simplicity of the spectrum.
In particular, the a.e. exponential (strong) convergence o f the Brun [FIKO96, Mee99, Sch01] and
Jacobi–Perron algorithm [BAG01] (see also [Lag93, Sch96b] ) holds in dimension d= 2: there

We have seen already in Section 3.3 that the quality of ration al approximations provided by
continued fraction algorithms obtained dynamically by an i teration of a map can be expressed
in terms of the two ﬁrst Lyapunov exponents. There is, in fact , a strong link with the uniform

The computation of Lyapunov exponents is a challenging prob lem. For numerical results, see
[BST21]. In practice, ergodic theorems provide eﬃcient way s of estimating Lyapunov exponents
numerically by following trajectories and then taking aver ages over truncated trajectories. This has
been developed e.g. in [HK02, BN96] for continued fractions or in [Zor97] for interval exchanges.
Transfer operators are eﬃcient ways to reach them, such as de veloped e.g. in [Pol10, JPV18], by
getting in some cases exact computations for the top Lyapuno v exponents of random products of
matrices using transfer operators. Indeed, transfer opera tors come with the analogue of Perron–
Frobenius theory for non-negative matrices. They are well s uited to provide approximations by
working in ﬁnite dimension, for instance by truncating Tayl or expansions of analytic functions
[DFV97, Lho04]. See also [ST19] for lower and upper bounds fo r the Lyapunov exponents for
random products of square matrices with determinant 1 havin g real and non-negative entries.
4.5.Classical examples. With this section we want to illustrate the variety of contin ued frac-
tions algorithms deﬁned according to the formalism of Secti on 4.4, as well as to focus on two
classical algorithms, namely the Brun and the Jacobi–Perro n algorithms.
Consider an algorithm based on elementary matrices, i.e., o n subtractions, such as described in
Section 4.4. In order to stress the simple rules that govern t hem, we express them in dimension
d+ 1 = 3. We thus start with parameters ( ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3)∈R3
+. We have to decide which number has
to be subtracted, and with respect to which number it has to be done. Usually numbers ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3
are sorted in increasing (or decreasing) order. We stress th e subtraction rule but it is usually
preceded and followed by a sorting operation.
For Jacobi–Perron, we subtract the second entry from the oth er ones, with the entries being
ordered in such a way that the ﬁrst entry is the largest one. Fo r Brun, we subtract the second
largest from the largest one. For Poincaré, we subtract the s econd largest entry from the largest
one, the third largest from the second largest, etc. For Selm er, we subtract the smallest (positive)
entry from the largest one. For the Fully subtractive algori thm, we subtract the smallest (positive
entry) from all the larger ones.
We also recall that given an algorithm described at the level of ad+ 1-dimensional space, there
exist several possible projectivizations. This is the case of the various forms taken by the Brun
algorithm. In particular, the Brun algorithm is also called modiﬁed Jacobi–Perron algorithm: the
modiﬁed Jacobi–Perron algorithm introduced by Podsypanin in [Pod77] is a two-point extension
of the Brun algorithm.
Consider now the Jacobi–Perron algorithm (that will be hand led in more details with respect to
the nearest integer part in Section 7). The linear form of the Jacobi–Perron algorithm is deﬁned16 V. BERTHÉ, K. DAJANI, C. KALLE, E. KRAWCZYK, H. KURU, AND A. THEVIS
on{(y0, y1, y2)∈R3\ {0}:y0≥y1, y2≥0}by
(y0, y1, y2)/ma√sto→(y1, y2− ⌊y2/y1⌋y1, y0− ⌊y0/y1⌋y1).
If we set
x1:=y1/y0, x2:=y2/y0,
we recover its projective version deﬁned on [0 ,1]2as
(x1, x2)/ma√sto→({x2/x1},{1/x1}).
Let us stress the diﬀerence between Brun’s and Jacobi–Perro n’s rule. The Brun algorithm is
a space-ordering algorithm according to the terminology in troduced in [HK01]. (Note that it is
called ordered Jacobi–Perron in [HK00].) Furthermore, eac h step of the Brun algorithm produces
only one digit. This helps in computing the natural extensio n and the invariant measure of the
Brun algorithm (see e.g. [AN93]). Contrary to the Brun algor ithm, the role played by y1and
y2(in the description above) is not determined by a comparison between both parameters in
the Jacobi–Perron case; this might explain the fact that an e xplicit expression of the natural
extension of this algorithm is still not known. Nevertheles s, the framework of S-expansions and
the so-called techniques of Insertion and Singularization (see [IK02]) allow one to relate both
algorithms as shown in [Sch07]; see also [Sch08]. Both algor ithms (Brun and Jacobi–Perron) are
known to have an invariant ergodic probability measure equi valent to the Lebesgue measure (see
for instance [Sch90] and [Sch00]). However, this measure is not known explicitly for Jacobi–Perron
(the density of the measure is shown to be a piecewise analyti c function in [Bro96]), whereas it
is known explicitly for Brun [AN93, FIKO96]. Note that the Bu rn algorithm can be considered
as an additive algorithm [BLV18], where it is proved that par tial quotients tend to be equal to 1.
Lastly, let us quote [Nog01] for Borel-Bernstein type theor ems on the growth of partial quotients.
5.Lattice reduction and rational approximations
We now focus on the second approach discussed in Section 3.2 b ased on lattice reduction. Lat-
tice reduction methods induce indeed a particularly fruitf ul way of exhibiting good simultaneous
approximations, or else small values for linear forms. Algo rithms based on lattice reduction theory
are based on the following idea: lattice reduction algorith ms do not produce a priori the smallest
vector of a lattice, but a reasonably small vector. That is, a vector that is small enough for guar-
antying Diophantine approximation properties that can be c ompared with Dirichlet’s quality up
to an approximation factor exponential in the dimension. We can thus consider these algorithms
as providing eﬀective versions of Dirichlet’s theorem, yie lding a satisfying compromise between
eﬃcient computation and sharpness of the obtained bounds, t hat is, between algorithmic issues
and Diophantine quality.
Let us stress the fact that the range of applications of latti ce reduction is quite wide for the
following reasons. They play a central algorithmic role in c ryptology, computer algebra, integer
linear programming and algorithmic number theory. They are particularly versatile in terms both
of existing variants and algebraic contexts where they can b e developed, see e.g. [FS10, Cam17,
Nap96]. They are eﬃcient: LLL has a polynomial runtime with r espect to the dimension). In
particular, in the present context, they produce eﬃcient gc d algorithms (see e.g. [HMM98])
and there exist promising attemps in order to devise continu ed fractions upon them (see [Lag94,
BS13, Beu14]). However, there remains much to understand co ncerning their executions and the
geometry of the outputs [NS06, YD18].
Lattice reduction is based on the following elementary basi s transformations: they can be
described in terms of size reduction (the vector biof the basis ( b1, . . . , bd+1) is replaced by
bi−λbjwith 1 ≤j < i ), and of exchange steps, also called swaps (one exchanges biandbi+1).
These operations are decided with respect to the Gram-Schmi tdt orthogonalization of the basis b.
More precisely, let ( b∗
i) stand for the basis obtained via the Gram-Schmidt orthogon alization
from the basis ( b1, . . . , bd+1), i.e., b∗
iis the orthogonal projection of bion the orthogonal of
the space generated by bi,· · ·,bi−1.One writes b∗

The factor 3 /4 can be replaced by a parameter twith 3 /4< t < 1. The LLL algorithm consists
of two steps.
•First, make the basis proper by replacing bibybi−/⌊ar⌈⌊lµij/⌊ar⌈⌊lbj, forj < i , where /⌊ar⌈⌊lµij/⌊ar⌈⌊lstands
for the distance to the nearest integer;
•if for some i, Lovasz’ condition is not satisﬁed, then swap biandbi+1and go the previous
step.
Recall that we have sketched the basic strategy underlying t he use of lattice reduction in this
framework in Section 3.2. One starts with the lattice Λ tgenerated by the columns of the matrix
Mt:=
1 0 · · · 0−α1
0 1 · · · 0−α2
...............
0 0 · · · 1−αd
0 0 · · · 0 t
.
Note that det( Mt) =t, hence, the lattice Λ tchanges at each step of the algorithm. One lets t
tend to 0. Let us stress the fact that this strategy diﬀers fro m the one discussed in Section 4.5
where one worked with bases of the ﬁxed lattice Zd+1.
Lattice reduction algorithms such as LLL then perform a succ ession of permutations and sub-
tractions on the matrix Mt, i.e., it multiplies the matrix Mtby elementary matrices and permuta-
tion matrices. This is a common feature between unimodular c ontinued fraction algorithms and
algorithms based on lattice reduction, namely that they are made of a succession of permutations
and subtractions. The decisions are taken for classical uni modular continued fractions by com-
paring entries, whereas lattice reduction involves quadra tic comparisons in the sense that they
depend on the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.
For more on the way, lattice reduction provides best approxi mations of a real number, see
[NV10, p.226,267], and for a survey on the overall strategy f or getting constructive type results
in Diophantine approximation based on LLL, see [NV10, p. 222 ]. Nevertheless, note that even in
dimension 2, when using the Gauss algorithm whose eﬃciency h as been largely proved, one has
‘little control on the convergent which is returned; in part icular, this is notthe largest convergent
with denominator less than 2/radicalbig
C/3’, as quoted in [NV10, p.226 Example 1]; the bound 2/radicalbig
C/3
comes from Theorem 7 of [NV10, Chapter 6].
Several attempts already exist in order to use lattice reduc tion to get simultaneous approxim-
ations. Let us quote [FF79, Fer87, Lag82c, Lag85, Jus89, Jus 90, Jus92] for strongly convergent
algorithms; however they do not present the same advantages as more classical memory-less al-
gorithms. Let us quote also [Lag85] and [Lag94] based on Mink owski lattice reduction. This
approach is not eﬀective, but it produces best approximatio ns (which are known to be NP-hard to
locate in an interval [Lag85]). This study is extended in [GL 01] and in [Che13]. Let us quote also
[Beu14, BS13] built upon LLL. In [BS13] an iterated LLL algor ithm is designed that is obtained
by decreasing the parameter tfrom the lattice Λ t, by dividing it by a given constant (including
also experimental data). In [Beu14], the conditions that oc cur in LLL are proved to be linear in
the parameter t(tending to 0). The idea at step kis to consider the smallest parameter tkfor
which Λ tkis reduced, and then perform a reduction with tk−ε.
An eﬃcient way to input some dynamics with this reduction vie wpoint is to rely on homogeneous
dynamics with the (left) action of the diagonal ﬂow ( gt) deﬁned by
/bracketleftbiggetId 0
0 e−dt/bracketrightbigg
on the space of unimodular lattices, i.e., on the homogeneou s space SL(d+1,R)/SL(d+1,Z). This
is a very fruitful way to combine lattice reduction with the s trength of dynamical methods such as
highlighted in the survey [Che13]. This amounts to changing the parameter t. See e.g. [KLDM07].
This is particularly relevant for continued fractions deﬁn ed in terms of best approximations. In18 V. BERTHÉ, K. DAJANI, C. KALLE, E. KRAWCZYK, H. KURU, AND A. THEVIS
[CCb, CCa], Levy’s result about the almost sure growth rate o f the denominators of the convergents
from (4.4) is extended to the best Diophantine approximatio ns (see Deﬁnition 4.2). The value of
the limit is given by an integral over a codimension one subma nifold in the space of lattices
SL(d+ 1,R)/SL(d+ 1,Z).An analogue of the Doeblin-Lenstra discussed in Section 4.4 is also
given in [CCb]. As highlighted in [CCb], the section is provi ded by lattices whose ﬁrst two minima
of lattices are equal and the ﬁrst return map of the geodesic ﬂ ow in the transversal play the role of
an invertible extension of the missing Gauss map. The main id ea is to relate shortest and so-called
minimal vectors of the lattice Λ twith best approximations (see [Che13, Lemma 8]) together wi th
a suitable choice of a norm (see [Che13, Section 3.2] and [Che 11]).
6.Some applications of continued fractions
In this section we give a diverse range of applications of con tinued fractions in arithmetics,
cryptography and symbolic dynamics. In the next section we t hen propose possible hints for
improvements of dynamical unimodular continued fraction a lgorithms.
We start with arithmetical applications. Continued fracti ons play also an important role in
the arithmetic of algebraic curves. The relation between th e geometry of the elliptic curve y2=
x4−6ax2−8bx+cand the continued fraction of ywith respect to the x−1-adic valuation is given
in [AR80] and [Abe26]. The given elliptic curve has two ratio nal points at inﬁnity, call them P
andO, such that Ois the origin of Mordell-Weill group of the elliptic curve. T hen the order of
the image of P, which is called the inﬁnity divisor of the curve, in the Jaco bian is ﬁnite if and
only if the continued fraction of yis periodic. Moreover, the order depends on the period of the
continued fraction. This result has been generalized for th e hyperelliptic curves in [PF17]. The
torsion order of the inﬁnity divisor is given as the sum of the degrees of all partial fractions from
0 to the period of the continued fraction of yin [AR80, VdPT00, PVDP05]. Furthermore, thanks
to the periodic continued fraction of y, for a given even degree hyperelliptic curve y2=f(x), the
Pell equation for fis proved to have a non-trivial solution, i.e., there exist p, qink[x], pnot a
constant, such that p2−q2f= 1, in [AR80, PF17].
Cryptography is another ﬁeld where continued fractions occ ur in various places. First of all,
continued fractions can be used in cryptanalysis, e.g., to a ttack the RSA cryptosystem. This
cryptosystem is based on the mathematical problem of factor ing a natural number that is a
product of two large prime numbers. It is an asymmetric crypt osystem, i.e., a publicly known key
is used for encryption and a secret key is used for decryption . If the secret key is chosen too small,
one can use continued fraction expansions to eﬃciently comp ute the private key and break the
cryptosystem. This attack is known as Wiener’s attack (see [ Wie90]). Apart from cryptanalysis,
there is a connection between stream ciphers and continued f raction expansions. Stream ciphers are
symmetric cryptosystems, i.e., the same key is used for encr yption and decryption. A stream cipher
generates a pseudorandom bit string. To encrypt a message, e ach bit of the pseudorandom bit
string is combined with a bit of the secret message (e.g. with the XOR operation). Niederreiter uses
continued fraction expansions of generating functions to a nalyze the randomness of pseudorandom
sequences (see [Nie88]). In [Kan09], Kane constructs a stre am cipher using continued fractions. A
rather indirect connection to cryptography is the shared in terest in lattice reduction algorithms.
As described in Section 5, these algorithms compute relativ ely short vectors of lattices. Various
cryptosystems such as Frodo, Dilithium and Kyber are based o n the problem of ﬁnding short
vectors in lattices. Hence, the study of lattice reduction a lgorithms such as the LLL algorithm is
important for the security analysis of lattice-based crypt osystems.
We also note that due to its simplicity, the Brun algorithm ap pears in various application ﬁelds.
See [dR95], where eﬃcient exponentiation using addition ch ains is used. Note that continued
fractions were already used for addition chains; see e.g. [B BBD89]. See also the survey [WSJM11]
for application of lattice reduction and of the Brun algorit hm in wireless communications and
statistical signal processing.
We now consider some applications in (symbolic) dynamics wi th the seminal example of Stur-
mian dynamical systems, introduced by Morse and Hedlund in [ MH40]. There is an impressive
literature devoted to their study and to their possible gene ralizations in word combinatorics, andRATIONAL APPROXIMATIONS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINUED F RACTIONS 19
in digital geometry [RK01]. This is due to several factors. T hey provide symbolic codings for the
simplest arithmetic systems, namely the irrational transl ations on the circle, they also code dis-
crete lines and are unidimensional models of quasicrystals [BG13]. Moreover, the scale invariance
of Sturmian dynamical systems allows their description usi ng a renormalization scheme governed
by usual continued fractions via the geodesic ﬂow acting on t he modular surface. Renormalization
schemes can often be interpreted as continued fractions [Yo c06]. This was crystallized later with
the study of interval exchanges in relation with the Teichmü ller ﬂow, through the work, among
others, of Veech, Masur, Yoccoz and Avila. Similarly as for c ontinued fractions, there is no canon-
ical generalization of Sturmian words. Episturmian words, also called Arnoux-Rauzy words, have
attracted a lot of attention. See in particular [CFM08, AHS1 6a, AHS16b] for the study of associ-
ated continued fractions on the Rauzy gasket. It has been a lo ng-standing problem to ﬁnd good
symbolic codings for translations on the d-dimensional torus that enjoy the beautiful properties of
Sturmian sequences. Symbolic codings in terms of multidime nsional continued fraction algorithms
are deﬁned in [BST22]. In particular, given any exponential ly convergent continued fraction al-
gorithm, these sequences lead to renormalization schemes w hich produce symbolic codings of toral
translations. This yields symbolic codings for almost ever y translation of T2[BST22], and for
almost all 3-dimensional toral translations, paving the wa y for the development of equidistribu-
tion results for the associated Kronecker sequences. These results rely on the strong properties
provided by the fact that the second Lyapunov exponent is pos itive; this explains why they hold
only in small dimensions.
In view of the non-positivity of the second Lyapunov exponen t, there is a need to design
strongly convergent continued fractions algorithms in hig h dimensions. In fact, positivity of the
second Lyapunov exponent has only been proved in dimension d= 2 for classical algorithms, d= 3
for the Brun algorithm. One natural approach for the design o f continued fractions consists in
trying to derive continued fraction algorithms from lattic e reduction algorithms using the fact that
they compute short vectors and that they reach Dirichlet’s b ound (up to a constant depending
exponentially on the dimension). The design of continued fr actions will go along with the dynam-
ical modeling of lattice reduction algorithms (and more spe ciﬁcally LLL) for their probabilistic
analysis. There is also a need to improve existing algorithm s of a dynamical nature by taking
advantage of their dynamical properties.
For other types of number expansions, in particular for β-expansions, it turned out to be very
fruitful to introduce a random dynamical system to produce t he expansions. Where a determ-
inistic system is deﬁned as a pair ( X, T), arandom dynamical system makes use of a family of
transformations ( Ti:X→X)i∈I(for some index set I) all deﬁned on the same domain X, where
each map is chosen with a certain probability. One then studi es the compositions of the form
Tin◦ · · · ◦ Ti1(x), i j∈I,
instead of Tn(x). For β-expansions, i.e., expansions of real numbers xof the form/summationtext
k≥1bk
βkwith
β >1 a non-integer and each bian integer between 0 and β, a corresponding random dynamical
system was ﬁrst introduced in [DK03]. Applications of rando mβ-expansions with respect to ra-
tional approximations of real numbers were then described b y Daubechies et al. [DDGV06], see
also [DGWYl10, KHTA12], in relation to analog-to-digital c onversion and in [JMKA13, JM16] in
relation to random number generation. Random one-dimensio nal continued fraction algorithms
and their invariant measures were studied in [KKV17, BRS20, DKM21, TC21, KMTV22]. Of-
ten, in terms of dynamics and the corresponding approximati on properties, such a random sys-
tem performs comparably to the best performing determinist ic system present in the family
(Ti:X→X)i∈I, but with the added ﬂexibility that real numbers now have man y diﬀerent
expansions assigned to them. Even though it is not quite clea r at the moment whether pla-
cing multidimensional continued fraction algorithms in a r andom framework could yield similar
advantages, it might be of interest to study this further.20 V. BERTHÉ, K. DAJANI, C. KALLE, E. KRAWCZYK, H. KURU, AND A. THEVIS
7.Improving Jacobi–Perron algorithm
In 1981 both Ito and Tanaka in [TI81] and Nakada in [Nak81] int roduced the notion of α-
continued fractions for α∈[1/2,1]. This was done by replacing ⌊1
x⌋in the deﬁnition of the Gauss
map TGby⌊1
x+ 1−α⌋in [TI81] and by ⌊1
|x|+ 1−α⌋in [Nak81]. For the setup of Nakada the
convergents of the corresponding α-continued fraction of a point form a sub equence of its regul ar
convergents, and hence provide better approximations. In p articular, for α∈[1
2,√
5−1
2], all the
corresponding α-continued fraction algorithms are isomorphic and provide better approximations
than the ones given by the regular continued fractions. See i n particular [KSS12] for results on the
entropy. One can use a similar idea to improve the convergenc e properties of the Jacobi–Perron
algorithm. To keep the exposition simple we will consider th e nearest integer case, corresponding
toα=1
2, and we will not take absolute values inside the ﬂoor functio n (so the digits generated
could be negative).
It is well known that when it comes to convergence speed, in on e dimension the nearest integer
algorithm performs best. See e.g. [BDV02]. Dynamically the algorithm is given by the map
T(x) =1
x− |||1
x|||, where ||| · ||| denotes the distance to the nearest integer as before. The ma p is
well deﬁned on the interval [ −1
2,1
2]. The possible continued fraction digits for this algorith m are
all integers nwith |n| ≥2. In higher dimensions a nearest integer version of the Jaco bi–Perron
algorithm has attracted some attention. See Section 7.2 for numerical values for the nearest
integer Jacobi–Perron algorithm from [Ste]. We also recall that the Markov conditions on the
digits produced by the classical Jacobi–Perron algorithm h ave a very simple form and that the
piecewise analyticity of the density of its invariant measu re has been proved in [Bro96].

Figure 2. The Markov partition for the NIJP map for d= 2.
Theorem 7.1. Letd= 2. Let Pbe the collection of disjoint subsets of Cbounded by the ten lines
x1= 0,x2= 0,x2=±x1,x2=±2x1,x2=±1±2x1. Then Pis a Markov partition for T0.
Proof. To show that Pfrom Figure 2 is a Markov partition, we need to consider the im age under
T0of all sets P∩Ca,bforP∈ Pand cylinder set Ca,b∈ C. Due to symmetry, it is enough to only
consider the sets in the ﬁrst quadrant. We label the sets of PbyEi, Fi, Gi, Hi, Ji, 1≤i≤4, as
shown in Figure 2 and use Ca,b,P to denote the set P∩Ca,bwith P∈ P andCa,b∈ C. Figure 3
shows several of these sets in the ﬁrst quadrant. Based on the images of the sets Ca,b,P we
distinguish 15 types, indicated by the diﬀerent colors in Fi gure 3. Hence, to prove that T0admits
a Markov partition for d= 2 we need to compute the image under T0of each of these types of
sets. We describe what happens to the set C2,0,H1.
OnC2,0,H1the map T0is given by T0(x1, x2) = (x2
x1,1
x1−2). The boundary of C2,0,H1is the
union of three sets (we take all intervals open, because the e ndpoints of the intervals have no
impact on the Lebesgue measure of the sets):
∂1=/braceleftbigg
(x1, x2)∈C:x2= 0, x1∈/parenleftbigg2

∂2=/braceleftbigg

∂3=/braceleftbigg
(x1, x2)∈C:x1∈/parenleftbigg2
5,1

, x2= 1−2x1/bracerightbigg
.
Then
T0(∂1) =/braceleftbigg
(x1, x2)∈C:x1= 0, x2∈/parenleftbigg
0,1
2/parenrightbigg/bracerightbigg
,
T0(∂2) =/braceleftbigg

,
T0(∂3) =/braceleftbigg
(x1, x2)∈C:x2=x1, x1∈/parenleftbigg
0,1
2/parenrightbigg/bracerightbigg
.
From this we can conclude that T0(C2,0,H1) =E1∪F1∪G1. A similar computation can be done
for each of the sets Ca,b,P. Table 1 lists the images of each type of set Ca,b,P in the ﬁrst quadrant.
See also Figure 4. By symmetry, similar results are obtained for sets Ca,b,P in the other quadrants,
from which we can deduce that the collection Pis a Markov partition for T0with d= 2. /squareRATIONAL APPROXIMATIONS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINUED F RACTIONS 23

From Table 1 we can deduce the restrictions that apply to appl ications of the matrices from
(7.1). For example, from the ﬁrst two lines we read that the di git (2 ,0) can only be followed by
a digit ( a, b) with a, b≥0. Some restrictions are more complicated to describe and ca rry further.
For example, the digit (3 ,2) can be followed by the digits ( −2,0), (−2,−1), (−3,−1), (−3,−2)
and ( −4,−2). The digit ( −2,0) can in principle be followed by any digit ( a, b) with a, b≤0, but if
one sees (3 ,2) followed by ( −2,0) then this can only be followed by those digit ( a, b) with a, b≤0
such that Ca,b∈H3∪J3. Knowing which sequences of digits are allowed, tells us whi ch matrix
products involving matrices of the form (7.1) we have to anal yze in order to obtaining numerical
information about the approximation properties of the near est integer Jacobi–Perron algorithm.
Giving a fuller description of the allowed digit sequences f rom the results in Table 1 would be a
ﬁrst step in this direction.
Having a Markov partition can also help in ﬁnding invariant m easures for the dynamical system
given by T0. Here we describe a diﬀerent approach that might lead to an in variant measure that is
absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure . To prove the existence of an a.c.i.m,
we follow the book of Schweiger [Sch00, Chapter 4], where he a nalyzed the ergodic properties
of the Jacobi–Perron algorithm (see also [May84, BAG01]). T he analysis is similar, we will be
brief. First notice that only cylinders of type 15 are full, i .e.T0([a, b)]) = Cup to sets of zero
Lebesgue measure. All other types are non-full. However, af ter at most three iterations, any
non-full cylinder is mapped to a region containing at least a ﬁxed positive proportion, say q, of
full cylinders. This implies that every non-full cylinder c an be written as a countable union of
disjoint full cylinders of higher rank (i.e. where more digi ts are speciﬁed), so that the collection of
full cylinders generate the Borel σ-algebra. This then allows one to deﬁne a jump transformatio n
with full cylinders and satisfying the conditions of Rényi [ R´57] (see also Theorem 8 in [Sch00]).
From this one concludes that the jump transformation admits an absolutely continuous invariant
ergodic measure. Then, Theorem 11 (see also Theorem 18) of [S ch00] implies that T0admits a
ﬁnite absolutely continuous invariant ergodic measure.
7.2.Experimental data. We now provide some experimental data due to Steiner [Ste] th e
Jacobi–Perron and the nearest integer Jacobi–Perron algor ithms indicating a better behaviour
for the nearest integer Jacobi–Perron algorithm in terms of Lyapunov exponents than for its usual
version.
For the nearest integer Jacobi–Perron algorithm (on the lef t) and the usual Jacobi–Perron
algorithm (on the right), one gets the following experiment al data.RATIONAL APPROXIMATIONS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINUED F RACTIONS 25
