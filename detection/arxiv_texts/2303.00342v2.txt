We revisit a cosmological scenario based on the classically conformal U(1)B−L-extension of the
Standard Model. Our focus is on the mechanism of reheating after inflation and the constraints on
the model parameters. In this scenario, the inflationary dynamics is driven by the U(1)B−LHiggs
field that is nonminimally coupled to gravity and breaks the U(1)B−Lsymmetry spontaneously as
it acquires a vacuum expectation value through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. It is found
that the reheating process proceeds stepwise, and as the decay channels of the U(1)B−LHiggs field
are known, the reheating temperature is evaluated. The relation between the e-folding number
of inflation and the reheating temperature provides a strong consistency condition on the model
parameters, and we find that the recent cosmological data gives an upper bound on the U(1)B−L
breaking scale vBL≲1012GeV. The lower bound is vBL≳106GeV, obtained as the condition for
successful reheating in this model. The prediction for the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
spectrum of this model fits extremely well with today’s cosmological data. The model can be tested
and is falsifiable by near future CMB observations, including the LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Standard Model of particle physics may be re-
garded as an outcome of gauging the global symmetries
that were initially introduced for classification of parti-
cles. The U(1)Yhypercharge originates from the work
of Nakano, Nishijima [1, 2] and Gell-Mann [3], while the
SU(2)Lsymmetry dates back to the work of Heisenberg
[4] who introduced the concept of isospin. The SU(3)c
quantum numbers were introduced in the 1960s for the
analysis of hyperons [5, 6] (see also [7]). This view may
be useful for investigating a theory beyond the Standard
Model. Indeed, there exists a U(1)B−L(baryon number
minus lepton number) global symmetry in the Standard
Model, which is usually considered accidental. Gauging
theU(1)B−L, one obtains a theory beyond the Standard
Model, that is the U(1)B−Lgauge extended Standard
Model. It is endowed with a new U(1)B−Lgauge boson
Z′. Breaking of this gauge symmetry at low energy is ac-
complished by a new complex scalar field Φ, which plays
the role of the Higgs boson for the U(1)B−Lsymmetry.
Furthermore, theoretical consistency requires three chi-
ral fermions (right-handed neutrinos) for anomaly can-
cellation. The minimal matter contents of the U(1)B−L
extended Standard Model are thus the Standard Model
particles, plus three right-handed neutrinos NRand the
U(1)B−LHiggs boson Φ, as listed in Table I.
The Standard Model is known to have several issues,
and interestingly, many of them find natural solutions
in the U(1)B−Lextention. The small but nonvanishing
(left-handed) neutrino masses indicated by neutrino os-
cillations, for example, are naturally generated through
∗kawai@skku.edu
†okadan@ua.eduthe seesaw mechanism as the right-handed neutrinos ac-
quire Majorana masses when the U(1)B−Lsymmetry is
spontaneously broken. Lepton asymmetry can also be
generated by the decay of the right-handed neutrinos,
which may later be converted into the baryon asym-
metry of the Universe in the so-called baryogenesis via
leptogenesis scenario. Cosmic inflation may also be ex-
plained in the framework of the U(1)B−L-extended Stan-
dard Model, as the U(1)B−LHiggs field Φ can play the
role of the inflaton , the field responsible for the dynam-
ics of inflation. A simple, observationally viable and phe-
nomenologically well-motivated model of cosmic inflation
is constructed by allowing the Φ field to nonminimally
couple to gravity. The model has been a subject of much
attention and has been studied actively from various as-
pects [8–13].
In this article, we examine the U(1)B−LHiggs infla-
tion model focusing on the reheating process after in-
flation. In inflationary cosmology, it is common to use
the number of e-folds, Nk, as a parameter that quantifies
the expansion of the Universe during inflation, or more
specifically, between the horizon exit of the scale of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the end of in-
flation. The typical range of Nkis between 50 to 70;
some uncertainly is usually assumed due to the model-
dependent specifics of the reheating process. Once the
scenario of particle cosmology is specified, however, this
Nkis calculable in principle. The purpose of the paper
is to carry out the computation of Nkin the case of the
U(1)B−LHiggs inflation model. The structure of the
model is that the inflationary dynamics is controlled by
two parameters, the breaking scale of the U(1)B−Lsym-
metry vBLand the U(1)B−Lgauge coupling gIat low en-
ergy. We will find the relation between the e-folding num-
ber and those two parameters of the U(1)B−L-extended
Standard Model, and show, by solving the renormaliza-
tion group equations and eliminating the uncertaintiesarXiv:2303.00342v2  [hep-ph]  2 Jul 20232

associated with the reheating process, that the prediction
for the CMB spectrum is determined by vBLandgI. At
present, those parameters are largely unconstrained, nei-
ther by collider experiments or by CMB observations. We
argue that these parameters will be severely constrained
by near future precision measurements of the CMB spec-
trum, or the U(1)B−LHiggs inflation scenario will be
ruled out entirely.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We review
theU(1)B−LHiggs inflation model in next section and
examine the reheating process of this model in Sec. III.
In Sec. IV we discuss the ranges of the model parame-
tersvBLandgIthat are of interest to us. We solve the
cosmological evolution together with the renormalization
group (RG) equations in Sec. V to find the prediction of
the inflationary scenario. We conclude in Sec. VI with
brief comments. The appendices contain supplementary
mathematical details and technical notes.
II. HIGGS INFLATION IN THE
U(1)B−L-EXTENDED STANDARD MODEL
We consider the minimal U(1)B−Lextension of the
Standard Model, with the gauge group SU(3)c×
SU(2)L×U(1)Y×U(1)B−L. The particle contents are the
Standard Model particles supplemented by three genera-
tions of singlet leptons (the right-handed neutrinos) and
a complex scalar with the U(1)B−Lcharge 2, as listed
in Table I. We consider the classically conformal model,
that is, the scalar potential is given by
V=λΦ(Φ∗Φ)2+λH(H†H)2−eλ(Φ∗Φ)(H†H),(1)
where λΦ,λHandeλare dimensionless couplings. We
assume the mixing is small, 0 <eλ≪1, so that thedynamics of Φ and Hare separate during inflation. We
may decompose the complex scalar Φ into two real scalars
ϕandχas
Φ =1√
2(ϕ+iχ). (2)
The real component ϕis assumed to have a large initial
value and drive inflation, that is, it plays the role of the
inflaton . The χfield does not play any significant role be-
low. Including the nonminimal coupling of Φ to gravity,
the Jordan frame action for the inflaton sector is

Asat the pivot scale k. The scalar spectral index and
the tensor-to-scalar ratio are expressed using the slow roll
parameters as,
ns= 1−6ϵV+ 2ηV, r = 16ϵV. (12)
The coupling λ(µ) is subject to the RG flow. We focus
on the regime where the effects of the Yukawa couplings
yi
Mand the running of the nonminimal coupling ξare
negligible. Then the RG equations for the self coupling λ
and the U(1)B−Lgauge coupling gare, at 1-loop order,
βλ≡dλ
dlnµ=20λ2+ 96g4−48λg2
16π2, (13)
βg≡dg
dlnµ=12g3
16π2. (14)
We interpret the quantum corrections in the presence of
nonminimal coupling as follows [17]. The renormalization
scale of the Jordan frame, in which the theory is defined,
is given by the field ϕ. The renormalization scale (of
mass dimension one) is then appropriately rescaled in the
Einstein frame, in which measurements are made. Thus
the renormalization scale µthat appears in the effective
potential in the Einstein frame (8) takes the form [18]
µ=ϕ
Ω(ϕ)=MPϕp
M2
P+ξϕ2. (15)
This is also the renormalization scale µused in the RG
equations (13) and (14). Note that the scale µasymptote
to a constant value µ→MP/√ξat large ϕ, thus the
RG running slows down and stops at high energy. This
behavior is in accord with the presumed UV finiteness of
the theory near the Planck scale; there the metric and
hence the length scale is blurred by the quantum gravity
effects and above certain energy the concept of scale loses
its meaning.
At low energy, the U(1)B−Lgauge symmetry is broken
by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The symmetry
breaking vacuum ϕ=vBL(where we live) satisfies the
stationarity condition
dVE
dϕ
ϕ=vBL= 0. (16)
We suppose that the symmetry breaking scale is much
lower than the inflationary scale ( vBL≪MP/√ξ). Then
the renormalization scale is µ≈ϕnear ϕ=vBL, see
(15), thus the distinction between the Einstein frame and
the Jordan frame is unimportant at low energy. The
condition (16) gives a relation between λandg,

it should in the symmetry breaking minimum. The mass

up to the scale µrelevant for the inflationary dynamics.
Using (22), the RG equation for the self coupling (13)
can be numerically integrated so that the effective po-
tential of the inflaton (8) can be evaluated. The slow roll
parameters are then given by (9), (10) as functions of ϕ.
To find the field value ϕ=ϕeat which inflation ends,
we use the condition that one of the slow roll parame-
ters becomes unity, ϵV(ϕe) = 1. The horizon exit of the
CMB scale takes place at a larger value of the inflaton
field ϕ=ϕk, and there the amplitude of the curvature
perturbation (11) at the pivot scale kis normalized by
the observational value [16]. This normalization fixes the
nonminimal coupling ξ. The number of e-folds for the
cosmic expansion between the horizon exit of the CMB
scale and the end of inflation is

In the standard slow roll paradigm of inflationary cos-
mology, it is a common practice to consider this e-folding
number Nkas a free parameter reflecting the uncertainty
of the reheating process. In the next section we ex-
amine the concrete reheating process of the inflationary
model based on the U(1)B−L-extended Standard Model
and evaluate the e-folding number.4
III. REHEATING AFTER CLASSICALLY
CONFORMAL U(1)B−LHIGGS INFLATION
A salient feature of this cosmological model based on
the classically conformal potential (1) is that the quartic
term dominates the potential at high energy, as the mass
term is generated by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism
only at the scale where the U(1)B−Lsymmetry is bro-
ken. Thus, at the end of inflation when the amplitude of
ϕis still large, the potential is essentially quartic. The
symmetry breaking mass term becomes important as the
oscillating amplitude of ϕbecomes small due to redshift.
The reheating process thus proceeds stepwise: after in-
flation, the inflaton oscillates in the potential which is
approximately quartic, and as the amplitude of the os-
cillations is damped by the redshift the inflaton starts to
feel the presence of the mass term (19), and then starts to
oscillate in the approximately quadratic potential about
the symmetry breaking minimum ϕ=vBL. Eventually,
as the Hubble expansion rate Hbecomes comparable to
the decay rate Γ of the inflaton, the energy deposited in
the inflaton is converted into the radiation of relativis-
tic Standard Model particles and the Universe becomes
thermalized.
The transition from the oscillations in the quartic-like
potential to the oscillations in the quadratic-like poten-
tial is important, since the expansion rate of the Uni-
verse changes there and the prediction of the inflation-
ary model is affected. At the transition, the inflaton that
was swinging with a large amplitude fails to go over the
central maximum of the double well potential. This sit-
uation is characterized by the condition that the kinetic
term of the inflaton becomes comparable to the potential
hight at the central maximum VE(ϕ= 0) = V0. Thus the
inflaton energy density at this moment is approximately
ρ⋆≃V0=3
128π2m4
Z′. (24)
We assume that the decay of the inflaton and the ensu-
ing thermalization of the Universe takes place after this
quartic-quadratic transition. This condition is written
Γ≲H⋆, (25)
with H⋆the Hubble expansion rate at the transition from
the quartic oscillation regime to the quadratic oscillation
regime. If the decay rate Γ is larger than H⋆, the in-
flaton will decay immediately after the transition and
thus corresponds to the case when the condition (25) is
saturated. One may also consider possible decay of the
inflaton condensate into radiation during the oscillations
in the quartic potential [19]. We discuss this effect in
Appendix B. It is found that this effect is negligible if a
condition slightly weaker than (25) is satisfied.
Using the Friedman equation and (24), the condition
(25) is rewritten, up to a factor of O(1), as
Γ≲m2
Z′
8πMP. (26)We will see how this condition constrains the model pa-
rameters in Sec. IV.
A. The number of e-folds
We now evaluate the number of e-folds based on this
picture, assuming otherwise the standard thermal history
of the Universe. We denote the comoving wave number
of the CMB scale by k. Then the scale factor akand the
Hubble parameter Hkat the horizon exit of the CMB
scale are related by k=akHk. We write the scale factor
at the end of inflation as ae, at the quartic-quadratic
transition as a⋆, at the thermalization of the Universe
(end of reheating) as ath, at the matter-radiation equality
asaeq, and the scale factor today as a0. Then one obtains
an obvious relation
k
a0H0=akHk
a0H0=ak
aeae
a⋆a⋆
athath
aeqaeq
a0Hk
H0, (27)
where H0= 100 hkm s−1Mpc−1with h= 0.674 [20] is
the Hubble parameter today. The logarithm of the first
factor Nk≡ln(ak/ae) is the e-folding number of infla-
tion that we wish to evaluate. From the end of infla-
tion to the quartic-quadratic transition, we may write
ae/a⋆= (ρ⋆/ρe)1/4, where ρ⋆is (24) and ρeis the en-
ergy density at the end of inflation, which is roughly
twice the potential energy, ρe≃2Ve. We used the
fact that when a scalar field oscillates in a quartic po-
tential the Universe undergoes a radiation-dominant like
expansion. Likewise, from the quartic-quadratic transi-
tion to the thermalization of the Universe we may write
a⋆/ath= (ρth/ρ⋆)1/3, where ρthis the energy density
at thermalization and we have used the fact that when a
scalar field oscillates in a quadratic potential the Universe
undergoes a matter-dominant like expansion. The eval-
uation of the remaining factors is standard, e.g. [21, 22].
From the thermalization to the matter-radiation equality,
entropy conservation and the Stefan-Boltzmann law give
ath/aeq= (ρeq/ρth)1/4(geq
∗/gth
∗)1/12, where ρeqis the en-
ergy density at the matter-radiation equality and gth
∗,geq
∗
are the numbers of relativistic degrees of freedom at the
thermalization and the matter-radiation equality, respec-
tively. The factor aeq/a0= 1/(1 +zeq) is the redshift of
the matter-radiation equality. We use the slow roll Fried-
man equation to write the Hubble parameter at the time
of the horizon exit of the wave number kin terms of the
the potential Vk, asHk=p
Vk/(3M2
P). Assembling all
those pieces we find the e-folding number Nkbetween the

Apart from the uncertainly of the reheating temperature

is determined by the potential (8) and can be evaluated
once the dynamics of the U(1)B−LHiggs field is known2.
In order to evaluate the reheating temperature we need
to consider the decay modes of the inflaton.
B. Decay of the inflaton
Eq. (19) shows that the Z′mass is heavier than the
inflaton mass in the perturbative regime ( g≲1). Thus
the decay of the inflaton into the Z′boson is kinemati-
cally forbidden3. Also, the inflaton is a Standard Model
singlet and it cannot decay through the Standard Model
gauge interactions. Thus the dominant decay channel of
the inflaton is through the Standard Model Higgs field.
Let us use the unitary gauge

3It has been pointed out in [23] that for λ≳3×10−4, violent
preheating into the longitudinal mode of the gauge boson may
take place in the first few oscillations of the inflaton, due to spike-
like features of the conformal factor Ω. This potentially leads
to an issue of unitarity as the decay products have extremely
high momenta ∼√
λMP. In our model this unitarity bound
corresponds to gI≲0.13, which is somewhat stronger than the
bound from perturbativity (see (45) and Fig. 1 below).
4For example, λH≃0.1 and its quantum corrections are
O(g4
2/16π2), which is negligible.The Higgs mass is mh= 125 .25 GeV [24]. Now we may
think of two separate cases, (i) when the inflaton mass is
heavier than twice the Higgs mass mϕ>2mh, and (ii)
when the inflaton mass is lighter than twice the Higgs
mass mϕ<2mh. Let us discuss those two cases in turn.
Below in this section we consider the fields shifted about
the minimum h→h+vH,ϕ→ϕ+vBL.

where the factor of 4 is to take into account the effects
of mass mixing [25–28]. According to the standard per-
turbative picture of reheating5, the inflaton starts to de-
cay when the Hubble parameter becomes smaller than
the decay rate Γ ϕ. Assuming that the thermalization
is instantaneous6, we have Γ ϕ≃Hthandρthin (28) is

In the second case, when the inflaton is lighter than
2mh, the process ϕ→hhis kinematically forbidden. If
the mass range is mh< m ϕ<2mh, the process ϕϕ→
hhis possible, but reheating through this process is not
possible as the decay rate Γ( ϕϕ→hh) redshifts faster
than the Hubble expansion rate. When mϕ<2mh, the
inflaton may instead decay through the mixing with the
Higgs boson. The mass matrix of the scalars

picture is sufficient for typical examples [19].
6Although the completion of thermalization and the start of ra-
diation dominance are not exactly the same, the distinction is
insignificant in our evaluation of (28).6

perature is similar to (39), with Γ ϕnow replaced by Γ eϕ.IV. CONSTRAINTS ON THE PARAMETERS
Before discussing the cosmological prediction of the in-
flationary model in the next section, let us summarize the
constraints on the two parameters vBLandgI.
First of all, we assume that perturbative quantum field
theory is valid up to the scale of inflation. As the condi-
tion of perturbativity we demand that the gauge coupling
is perturbative up to the Planck scale7
g(µ=MP)<1. (44)
Using the solution (22) of the RG equation this condition
is written, with µI=µ(ϕ=vBL)≃vBL,
gI<1q
1 +3
2π2lnMP
µI. (45)
Other conditions concern the decay of the inflaton, so
let us consider the two separate cases as we did in the
previous section.
1.mϕ>2mh
7It may be somewhat more natural to consider α≡g2/4π < 1
atµ→MP/√ξas the criterion of perturbativity. We however
use the slightly tighter condition (44) for the sake of practical
convenience, as it is ξ-independent and leaves some margin from
the singular regions that are numerically difficult to handle.7
Using (19), the condition mϕ>2mhis written
gI≳2πmh√
6vBL1

The condition (25) that the inflaton decay after the
quartic-quadratic transition is written using (37) as
gI≳ 
πMPm4
h

BL!1

. (47)
It can be checked that (46) is a stronger constraint
than (47) when vBL>1.23×107GeV.
2.mϕ<2mh
In this case the condition mϕ<2mhis written
gI≲2πmh√
6vBL1
2
, (48)
and the condition that the inflaton decays after the
transition (25) reads
Γeϕ≲m2
Z′
8πMP, (49)
where Γ eϕis evaluated using (42) and (43).
Fig. 1 shows the constraints on the symmetry break-
ing scale vBLand the gauge coupling at low energy gI
as described above. The green region is excluded by the
perturbativity condition (45) and the blue region is ex-
cluded by the requirement that the decay of the inflaton
takes place after the quartic-quadratic transition, (47) for
the left panel and (49) for the right panel. The orange
region is excluded by the condition on the inflaton mass,
mϕ>2mhfor the left panel and mϕ<2mhfor the right
panel. Light inflaton mϕ≲106TeV is excluded in both
cases, and there are both upper and lower bounds for gI
in the mϕ>2mhcase, whereas in the mϕ<2mhcase
gIis only bounded from above.
Let us also comment on the bounds that come from
the collider experiments. Fig. 2 shows the bounds on vBL
andgIobtained from the search for high-mass dilepton
resonance by the ATLAS detector in the Large Hadron
Collier [33] (139 fb−1proton-proton collisions at a center
of mass energy√s= 13 TeV). The lower left region to
the red curve is excluded. Also shown are the green and
orange lines, that are the perturbativity bound and the
mϕ= 2mhline as in Fig. 1. Comparing Fig. 2 and Fig. 1,
the bounds from the ATLAS experiments are seen to pro-
vide no further constraints on the parameter space of the
inflationary model as the region is already excluded by
the condition H⋆<Γϕ(in the case of mϕ>2mh) or
H⋆<Γeϕ(in the case of mϕ<2mh).

V. CMB SPECTRUM OF THE U(1)B−LHIGGS
INFLATION MODEL
Let us now discuss the prediction of the cosmological
model.
A. Numerical method
In order to determine the set of parameters that meet
the consistency requirements and to calculate the result-
ing spectrum of the CMB, we employ the following pro-
cedure to solve the slow roll equation of motion and the
RG equations. For a specified value of the symmetry
breaking scale vBL, we choose a set of parameters N(test)
k
andgIso that ( vBL, gI) is within the allowed parameter
region discussed in Sec. IV. Then the slow roll equation
and the RG equations can be numerically integrated, us-
ingN(test)

field value ϕkat the horizon exit of the CMB scale. The
value of the nonminimal coupling ξis adjusted so the the
amplitude of the curvature perturbation PRmatches the
Planck normalization value [16] at the pivot scale. Then
the cosmological evolution is determined by the set of
three parameters ( vBL, N(test)
k, gI), and we may evaluate
the e-folding number defined by the formula (28), which,
in general, differs from the value of N(test)
k. We then
make a scan of the parameter gI(but vBLandN(test)
k
kept fixed) to see if Nkof (28) can be adjusted to be8

is found in the range of Sec. IV, then the solution meets
all consistency requirements. If this procedure fails, then
that means there is no cosmological solution compatible
with the reheating consistency requirement.
We carried out the parameter scan within the allowed
regions of Fig. 1, and have found solutions satisfying
these requirements. In the case of mϕ>2mh, for
vBL≳106GeV there exist consistent cosmological so-
lutions between the upper and lower bounds of gI. In
contrast, when mϕ<2mhwe only found consistent solu-
tions in narrow vicinities of mϕ=mh, where the mixing
angle between ϕandhbecomes θ=π/4. While this
situation may be of some phenomenological interest, it
is outside of our initial assumption that the inflaton dy-
namics is independent of the Standard Model Higgs field
during inflation, and we thus will not examine this case
further.
B. Numerical results
We thus discuss the results for the mϕ>2mhcase
below. Fig. 3 shows the solutions. The left panel is
the prediction for the CMB spectrum, the primordial
tiltnsagainst the tensor-to-scalar ratio rfor the con-
sistent solutions as described above. The curves indi-
cate solutions for fixed values of vBL= 106GeV to 1012
GeV and the background contours shaded in blue are the
68% and 95% confidence level constraints of the recent
Planck+BICEP/Keck 2018 constraints [34]. It is seen
that the prediction of the model comfortably sits inside
the 68% contour, up to vBL≲1012GeV. The right panelshows the same set of solutions on the ns-gIplane. In
both panels, the endpoints marked with a filled/blank
circle correspond to the lower/upper bound of gIshown
on the left panel of Fig. 1. The vBL= 106GeV solution
is seen to be trimmed by the Γ ϕ< H ⋆constraint, as one
can see by comparing with Fig. 1, left panel.
In Fig. 3, the prospect constraint contours by the Lite-
BIRD and CMB-S4, for a r= 0 fiducial model are shown
in green and red. The prediction of the cosmological
model studied here is clearly outside the 2- σcontours,
and thus would be strongly disfavored if those projects
bring null results. If, on the other hand, the tensor
mode is detected, the measurements of the CMB spec-
trum would give significant constraints on the parameter
space of the U(1)B−LHiggs inflation model.
VI. FINAL REMARKS
We have examined the reheating process of the infla-
tionary scenario based on the U(1)B−Lextension of the
Standard Model, and formulated the condition of consis-
tency in terms of the number of e-folds. We then solved
the equation of the inflationary dynamics along with the
RG equations to identify solutions that meet these re-
quirements. The results show that the predictions of the
CMB spectrum are in excellent agreement with current
observational constraints. It is also suggested that the
proposed model could be tested by future experiments,
such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4. Our aim was to address
the previously overlooked aspects of model construction
and to provide a clearer prediction for cosmological ob-
servables by incorporating the consistency condition from9
the reheating process.
The primary focus of this paper has been the anal-
ysis of a simple inflationary model, which is character-
ized by two key parameters: the U(1)B−Lbreaking scale
(vBL) and the U(1)B−Lgauge coupling ( gI) at low en-
ergy. The U(1)B−Lextension of the Standard Model
is a well-motivated theory beyond the Standard Model,
and this example may be considered as one of the best
candidate cosmological scenarios based on particle phe-
nomenology. Clearly, our analysis can be extended to
more involved cosmological models. For instance, the
U(1)B−Lmodel can be extended to the U(1)Xmodel
that allows for the mixing of the U(1)B−LandU(1)Y
gauge symmetries without violating the anomaly cancel-
lation condition, as described for example in [13]. Ad-
ditionally, inflationary models based on supersymmetric
extensions of the Standard Model, such as those discussed
in [37, 38], may also be worthy of exploration. As upcom-
ing observational cosmology projects are poised to bring
new results in the near future, particularly with regards
to the CMB B-model polarization, it is a promising time
to re-evaluate the reheating dynamics of these inflation-
ary scenarios.

Appendix A: Evaluation of the slow roll parameters
In our computation, the slow roll parameters (9), (10)
are used to identify the field value at the end of infla-
tion, to find the normalized amplitude of the curvature
perturbation, as well as to evaluate the spectrum of the
CMB. The expressions of (9) and (10) involve VE(8) as
well as its ϕ-derivatives. The concrete expressions of the
first and second derivatives of VEemployed in our anal-
ysis are obtained using the RG equations (13), (14) and
the relation (15) for µ(ϕ). These are

Appendix B: Inflaton decay during oscillations in
the quartic potential
In the main text we did not consider the decay of the
inflaton when it is oscillating in the quartic potential. As
discussed e.g. in [19], the oscillating inflaton may be in-
terpreted to form a condensate obtaining its mass from
the averaged periodic motions, and decay into radiation
during this regime. Here we discuss this effect, first eval-
uating the criteria for which the decay can be efficient,
and then give an alternative picture of it based on parti-
cle scattering.
1. Efficiency of the energy depletion
We consider the classically conformal effective action
(1) of the U(1)B−LHiggs inflation model
V=λ|Φ|4+λH(H†H)2−eλ|Φ|2(H†H) + (1-loop) ,
(B1)
and decompose Φ in the unitary gauge into a lowly vary-
ing background field ϕoand the field ϕon that back-
ground,
Φ =1√
2(ϕo(t) +ϕ). (B2)
In this regime, the field ϕhas a time-dependent effec-
tive mass

Thus the depletion of the inflaton energy by the decay

in the quadratic potential. Using (B7) and evaluating

This is seen to be a slightly weaker condition than (47).
2. Scattering picture
Instead of the decay ϕ→H†H, one may alternatively
consider the scattering process ϕϕ→H†H. The initial
ϕ’s are assumed to be condensed, at rest with energy ωϕ.
The number density of the inflaton quanta ϕmust then
obey the Boltzmann equation

as

We shall show that (B17) is equivalent to (B9), up to a
numerical factor.
We first note that nϕ=ρϕ/ωϕ, and that ωϕredshifts
asωϕ∝ϕo∝1/a, so that
