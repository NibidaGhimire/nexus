Parallel operations are important for both near-term quant um computers and larger-scale fault-
tolerant machines because they reduce execution time and qu bit idling. We propose and implement
a pairwise-parallel gate scheme on a trapped-ion quantum co mputer. The gates are driven simulta-
neously on diﬀerent sets of orthogonal motional modes of a tr apped-ion chain. We demonstrate the
utility of this scheme by creating a GHZ state in one step usin g parallel gates with one overlapping
qubit. We also show its advantage for circuits by implementi ng a digital quantum simulation of the
dynamics of an interacting spin system, the transverse-ﬁel d Ising model. This method eﬀectively
extends the available gate depth by up to two times with no ove rhead apart from additional initial
cooling when no overlapping qubit is involved. This is becau se using a set of extra modes as addi-
tional quantum degrees of freedom is nearly equivalent to ha lving the trap heating rate, doubling
the laser and qubit coherence time, and extending the contro ller memory depth by up to a factor of
two. This scheme can be easily applied to diﬀerent trapped-i on qubits and gate schemes, broadly
enhancing the capabilities of trapped-ion quantum compute rs.
I. INTRODUCTION
In order to create quantum computers that can tackle
problems of practical value, it is essential to make op-
timal use of the quantum resources available in a given
technology. Realizing quantum gatesin parallelis impor-
tant for scaling quantum devices since it speeds up the
implementation of quantum circuits and allows for more
operations to be executed within the coherence time.
Trapped ions are one of the most advanced quantum
computing platforms due to their high-ﬁdelity quantum
operations, all-to-all connectivity, and long coherence
times [1, 2]. Parallel entangling gates have been re-
ported in trapped-ion experiments [3–6]. However, these
schemes require extra classical overhead to calculate spe-
ciﬁc gate solutions for each unique combination of gates.
They also need extra optical power or longer gate times,
and, as a result, come with a loss in ﬁdelity compared to
sequential gates.
In harmonically trapped ion chains, entanglement gen-
eration between the spin qubits is mediated by the col-
lective motion of the ion crystal [7], which can be ex-
cited with laser beams [8, 9], microwaves [10], or radio
frequency waves [11]. In all trapped-ion entangling gate
schemesrealizedsofar,parallelorsequential,onlyoneset
of motional modes is considered, correspondingto the di-
rection of strongest overlap between the driving ﬁeld and
a principle trap axis. However, the ion chain has multi-
ple sets of independent motional modes along orthogonal
directions in space. The other sets of motional modes
are usually ignored, or decoupled by a rotation of the
trap principle axes. While used in a few analog quantum
simulations [12, 13] and considered in cost estimation for
error correction [14], this resource remains untapped for
entangling gates and digital quantum circuits. In this
work, we use an additional set of modes to implement
two entangling gates on arbitrary pairs of ions in paral-lel, including cases where there is one overlappingion be-
tween the two pairs, with Raman laser beams [2]. Since
the two sets of modes are orthogonal, there is no need
to calculate unique parallel gate pulses, as existing laser
pulse designs can simply be applied simultaneously. For
addressing beam arrays, no extra laser power is required
when there is no overlapping ion since idle energy in the
laser beams is used. For overlapping pairs, this scheme
may require twice the laser power of a single entangling
gate on the shared ion, but typically less than that. The
idea is directly applicable to any addressed entangling
gate scheme that uses the ion motion [3–6, 8, 9, 15–22].
It can also be extended to the third motional direction.
II. PARALLEL GATE SCHEME
In a linear Paul trap, the ions form a chain. In the ra-
dial directions, i.e. the plane perpendicular to the chain,
the ions are trapped in a pseudo-potential well that is
approximately harmonic along the two radial principal
axes,xandy. The ions experience a weaker harmonic
conﬁnement along the chain, in the axial zdirection [23].
TheNions in the chain act as a set of coupled harmonic
oscillatorsalongeach principal axis as a result ofthe con-
ﬁning potential and the Coulomb repulsion between the
ions. This gives rise to Nnormal motional modes along
each of the x,y, andzdirections. Normal modes on
diﬀerent principal axes are independent [23, 24].
Figure1shows the concept for running pairwise par-
allel gates. In the depicted setup, the ion chain is illu-
minated by an array of individual addressing beams and
one counterpropogatingglobal beam for driving coherent
operations, and the beam directions overlap with the two
radial principle axes. We use the Mølmer-Sørensen (MS)
scheme as our two-qubit gates. Using diﬀerent frequen-
cies, one pair of beams drives an MS gate on the x-modes2
FIG. 1. Experimental setup for parallel MS gates on orthog-
onal motional modes. A chain of ions is trapped in a linear

used as qubits. x,y, andzare the three principal axes of the
trap. The harmonic oscillator modes along the x- andy-axis
are shown in purple and green, respectively. Transitions ar e
driven by pair of Raman beams consisting of a global beam
(pink) and a counter-propagating addressing array. The col -
ors of the individual beams indicate diﬀerent detunings for
exciting motional modes along diﬀerent principal axes. Thi s

gate on the second and fourth ion via the ymotional modes.
(shown in green), and another pair simultaneously does
the same on another pair of ions on the y-modes (shown
in purple). This protocol can be applied to addressed
trapped-ion chains in any trap geometry, not limited to
the one shown in Figure 1, provided that the driving ﬁeld
has non-zero projections along multiple principal axes.
Other gate schemes can also be used, as noted in the
introduction.
Here we describe our experiment and protocol as an
example. We trap171Yb+ions in a linear Paul trap. The
qubit states |0/an}bracketri}htand|1/an}bracketri}htare encoded in the two hyperﬁne
ground states |F= 0,mF= 0/an}bracketri}htand|F= 1,mF= 0/an}bracketri}htin
the2S1/2manifold. The laser beams used for coherent
operationsarederivedfromamode-lockedlaseranddrive
a Raman transition between the two qubit states [25].
The beat-notes between the two beams are at ω0±µ,
which are closely detuned from blue and red motional
sidebands [2], where ω0is the carrier frequency. In order
to disentangle the modes from the qubits at the end of
the gate, modulation schemes for the amplitude, phase,
frequency of the laser pulse or a combination of these are
employed, leaving only the qubit states of the ion pair in
entanglement [26–30]. We use amplitude modulation [31]
for this demonstration, but any of the above schemes can
equally be used. The unitary representingan MS gate on
the qubit pair {p,q}isU= exp(iχpqσp
xσq
x), where σp
xis
the Pauli- Xoperator acting on qubit p, andχpqis the
gate angle which can be varied arbitrarily by applying a
scale factor to the amplitude of laser pulse.
While one MS gate on the pair {p,q}is driven on the
xmotional modes, we simultaneously drive another MS
gate via the ymodes on the qubit pair {m,n}. This si-multaneous gate can be implemented in the same way
as described above with the beat-notes of the counter-
propagating Raman beams tuned to ω0±µ′, which are
closely detuned from the motional side-bands of the y
modes. We now show that these simultaneous opera-
tions do not introduce cross-couplings. In the interac-
tion picture and the Lamb-Dicke regime, neglecting the
oﬀ-resonant carrier term, the Hamiltonian describing the
interactions present during the parallel gate (PG) is
HPG(t) =Hx(t)+Hy(t), (1)

In order to calculate the evolution unitary, we expo-
nentiate Eq. ( 1) using the Magnus expansion. Looking
at the ﬁrst two terms in the Magnus series, we have
UPG(τ) =e−i/integraltextτ
0dtHPG(t)−1
2/integraltextτ
0dt2/integraltextdt2
0dt1[HPG(t2),HPG(t1)],

whereτis the gate time. Expanding the commutator
yields
[HPG(t2),HPG(t1)] =[Hx(t2),Hx(t1)]+[Hy(t2),Hy(t1)]
+[Hx(t2),Hy(t1)]+[Hy(t2),Hx(t1)].
(3)
Note that, σi
xcommutes with σj
x, and since the xandy
modes are orthogonal akanda†
kcommute with bk′and
b†
k′. As a result, [ Hx(t1),Hy(t2)] = 0 at any time as well
as the last two terms in Eq. ( 3), which are the cross-
coupling terms between xandy. We emphasize that the
scheme also applies to cases where the two qubit pairs
share an ion since [ σi
x,σj
x] = 0 includes the case of i=j.
Either remaining term in Eq. ( 3) contains motion in the
x- direction only or the y-direction only. Same as the
case of one MS gate, the dependence on motion even-
tually vanishes in Eq. ( 3) due to the commutation re-
lations between the motional operators. Therefore, the
higher-order terms not shown in the Magnus expansion
in Eq. (2) are also zero. We can rewrite Eq. ( 2) as3

be treated separately. The Rabi frequencies Ω i(t)(i∈

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Using a chain of seven ions, we experimentally demon-
strate parallel MS gates on diﬀerent qubit pairs, includ-
ing the case where one qubit is shared between the two
pairs. We then show their beneﬁt for long circuits by
running a digital quantum simulation of a paradigmatic
spin model, the transverse ﬁeld Ising model.
A. Parallel gate ﬁdelity
For twoparallel MS gates ofangle π/4 implemented on
two non-overlapping pairs of qubits, we estimate the ﬁ-
delityofeachMS gatebymeasuringthe even-paritystate
populations of the output state and the parity contrast
[32, 33]. The parity contrast is extracted by appending
single-qubit π/2 rotations to the MS gate and varying
their phases. The results are shown in Fig. 2. We ﬁnd
that the performance of our parallel gates is overall very

are statistical.

similar to that of our sequential gates (see Table I), indi-
cating that no detectable error, such as motional cross-
talk between the two sets of radial modes due to trap
non-linearities, is added by the parallel operation. Yet,
the reduction in execution time will improve the ﬁdelity
of a complete circuit implementation with parallel gates.
We also estimate the degree of entanglement of the cross-
pairs. This could occur as a result of optical cross-talk
or motional cross-talk. Parity measurements plotted in4

B. Three-qubit entanglement
We use our scheme to entangle three ions in one step,
generatinga three-qubit GHZ state. The circuit is shown
in Fig.3(a). It consists of a three-qubit entangling gate
followed by π/2 phases gates and Hadamard gates.
Fig.3(b) shows the populations and parity contrast of
the GHZ state prepared with parallel MS gates on qubits
{3,5}and{2,5}. We estimate the ﬁdelity using parity
contrast and even-parity state populations again to ﬁnd
FGHZ= 97.6(3)%, which is as good as the three-qubit
GHZ of 97 .1(1)% ﬁdelity prepared on the same system
with sequential MS gates and improves upon the three-
qubit GHZ state prepared with global parallel gates re-
ported on another trapped ion experiment [6]. Since the
laser pulses for both MS gates are summed up on the
overlapping ion, in the worst case scenario, it will require
the sum of the power of the two gates to implement them
in parallel. However, it can often be done with less power
because the gate pulse segments with the highest amountof power in the two gate pulse shapes do not alwaysover-
lap.
C. Transverse ﬁeld Ising model with parallel gates
Quantum spin models can describe a wide range of
quantum many-body dynamics and are suitable for im-
plementation on diﬀerent hardware platforms [34, 35].
They can be used to study a variety of classically in-
tractable problems in condensed matter physics, such as
quantum magnetism [36], spin glasses [37], and others
[38]. We demonstrate the experimental advantage of our
parallel gate scheme over sequential gates by digitally
simulating the dynamics of 1D Transverse Field Ising
Model (TFIM) of ﬁve spins with nearest-neighbor inter-
actions. The Hamiltonian can be written as
H=−J4/summationdisplay
i=1σi
xσi+1

i=1σi

whereJandBcharacterize the strength of interaction
between the neighboring spins and the magnitude of the
external ﬁeld, respectively. The spin | ↑/an}bracketri}ht(| ↓/an}bracketri}ht) state is
mappedtothequbit |+/an}bracketri}ht(|−/an}bracketri}ht)state. Allqubitsareinitial-
ized in the |0/an}bracketri}ht=1√
2(| ↑/an}bracketri}ht+| ↓/an}bracketri}ht) state. The time-evolution
unitaryisTrotterizedanddecomposedintogates[39,40].
Circuits representingone Trotterstep areshown in Fig. 4
(a). Both circuits consist of MS gates, applied in se-
quence or in parallel, and single-qubit z-rotations. After
NTrotter steps, the qubits are measured in the zbasis,
and the total magnetization along z,m=/summationtext5
i=1σi
z, is
calculated. Since the single-qubit z-rotations are done as
instantaneous classical phase advances on the controller,
the circuit execution time with sequential MS gates is
twice as long as that with parallel MS gates.5
The results are plotted in Fig. 4(b). In the experi-
ment, the sequential gates are also done on both xandy
motional modes, consistent with the parallel gates, to en-
sure a fair comparison. The same MS gate pulse is used
for each qubit pair in both the parallel implementation
and the sequential implementation. For points of high-
magnetization, for which the observable is most sensitive
to errors, we see a reduction in error by up to a factor of
two in the parallel gate implementation as a consequence
of halving the circuit run time using parallel gates. This
demonstrates that there is an advantage in using parallel
gates, even for shorter circuits.
IV. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
While employing these pairwise-parallel gates in an
ion trap quantum computer does not reduce algorithm
complexity, it can provide a signiﬁcant ﬁdelity boost to
anycircuitimplementationsandshouldbeusedwhenever
possible. The only cost is a ﬁxed overhead for ground-
statecoolingtheadditionalsetofmodes, whichisalready
cooled to below the Doppler limit by the high-intensity
laser sideband cooling of the ﬁrst set of modes. There is
no calibration overhead in the parallel implementation.
In fact, the required number of calibrations is usually
reduced as gates can be calibrated in parallel. In the
worst case, where a gate for each qubit pair needs to be
calibrated with both sets of modes, the number of cali-brations is the same as in the sequential case.
This parallel gate is easily transferable to other linear
trap geometries. It can be generalized to any MS gate
pulse modulation and addressing schemes, provided that
the controllers can target multiple ions in space and mul-
tiple modes in frequency. It could alsobe extended to the
axial direction and be combined with other parallel gate
schemes that use motional modes only along one princi-
pal axis[3, 4, 6] to further increasethe maximumnumber
of simultaneous two-qubit gates. Finally, other entan-
gling gate mechanisms, such as light shift gates [9, 22],
those driven by a synthetic σzspin-dependent force [20],
the multi-qubit gate based on the Cirac-Zoller scheme
with ancillary motional states [21], or gates based on
mode squeezing via second-sideband driving [17, 19] can
be pairwise-parallelized in the same way.
