Taking the Noether gauge symmetry approach into account, we ﬁnd spherically symmetric static
black hole solutions of the non-minimal gauge-gravity Lagr angian of the RβF2model. At ﬁrst, we
consider a system of diﬀerential equations for the general n on-minimal couplings of Y(R)F2type,
and then, we regard a particular RβF2non-minimal model to ﬁnd the exact black hole solution
and analyze its symmetries. As the next step, we calculate th e thermodynamical quantities of the
black hole and study its interesting behavior. Besides, we a ddress thermal stability and examine
the possibility of the van der Waals-like phase transition.

I. INTRODUCTION
Undoubtedly, Einstein’s theory of gravity is one of the most beautif ul theories of physics. Although Einstein’s
theory of gravity has successfully addressed some essential que stions, it still has very important astrophysical and
cosmological problems such as dark matter and dark energy. To ov ercome these puzzles, various approaches have
been considered to propose alternative gravitational theories su ch as modiﬁed gravity models. The eﬀorts to modify
Einstein’s theory of gravity have recently increased by studying so me interesting models such as f(R) gravity [1, 2],
scalar-tensor gravity [3], and vector-tensor gravity. Besides, r egarding the electromagnetic nature of some gravitating
systems such as galaxies, galaxy clusters, stars and planets [4–9], we have to connect the Maxwell Lagrangian to
gravity model for giving an accurate description of the mentioned s ystems.
The modiﬁcation of Einstein’s gravity motivates us to think about the possible generalization of the Einstein-
Maxwell theory in non-minimal form, especially, in regions of spacetim e with very strong gravitation and gauge ﬁelds
like near the compact astrophysical objects with a high mass densit y such as the neutron stars or black holes. In
such cases, the gravitational ﬁeld behaves as a nonlinear medium in w hich the electromagnetic ﬁeld propagates, and
therefore, there is the possibility that gravity and electromagnet ic are coupled with each other through non-minimal
coupling. The non-minimal couplings, in general, can aﬀect the Maxwe ll and the Einstein ﬁeld equations: Its eﬀect on
the Maxwell equations can result in the magnetization and the polariz ation of a speciﬁc medium while its impact on
the Einstein equations may lead to important modiﬁcations to the spa cetime metric. If such eﬀects exist, it may be
possible to explain some unexpected observations of gravity such a s dark matter, dark energy, and Pioneer anomaly
[10–13].
The ﬁrst attempts in the area of non-minimal modiﬁcations were mad e by introducing non-minimal couplings of
the form RF2to get more information about the relationship between spacetime c urvature and the conservation of
electric charge [14, 15]. Later, they were extended to the genera l couplings in RmF2-type couplings to generate the
primordial magnetic ﬁelds in the inﬂation phase of the universe [16]. O n the other hand, the modiﬁed f(R) gravity
which has been proposed to explain the late-time acceleration of the universe has some black hole solutions in the
presence of electromagnetic ﬁelds which are not asymptotically ﬂat [17]. To have a well-deﬁned asymptotical behavior
and to explain the late-time accelerationand inﬂation of the universe , the extensions of f(R) gravityto the models like
f(R)-Maxwell [18, 19] and f(R)-Yang-Mills gravity [20] were studied. Moreover, general non-min imalf(R)-matter
couplings may explain the rotation curves of test particles gravitat ing around galaxies by producing the dark matter
eﬀect [21–23].
In most cases, considering the nonlinearity of the modiﬁed theories , direct method of solving the ﬁeld equations
cannot help us to obtain solutions. In this regard, the symmetry me thods like the Noether symmetry approach can
be regarded as a powerful tool to calculate the solutions of the ﬁe ld equations. The Noether symmetry approach
which is outlined in [24, 25] is based on the fact that there is a conserv ed quantity for every corresponding continuous

symmetry [26]. Making use ofthe Noether symmetryapproach, it is p ossible to obtainconservedquantitiesconcerning
the symmetries of the Lagrangian. The importance of the conserv ed quantities lies in the fact that they describe the
physical features of diﬀerential equations possessing a Lagrang ian in terms of conservation laws admitted by them.
Therefore, with the conservation relation in hand, the exact solut ions of the ﬁeld equations can be found. The key
role of the Noether symmetry as a geometric criterion to constrain alternative theories of gravity has been recently
received increasing attentions in cosmological and astrophysical s cales [27]. In this regard, the Noether symmetry
approach has been applied to study various cosmological scenarios including scalar-tensor cosmologies [28–31], f(R)
theories [32, 33], nonlocal f(T) gravity [34–36], f(R,T) theories [37] and the theory of f(G) [38]. Moreover, the
authors in [39, 40] have studied the exact solutions for potential f unctions, scalar ﬁeld and the scale factors in the
Bianchi models. Apart from the context of cosmology, this approa ch has also been useful to ﬁnd exact solutions in
spherically and axially symmetric spacetime [33, 41–44].
It is also worth noticing that the Noether symmetry can be consider ed in two ways: ﬁrst, the Noether symmetry
approach without a gauge term called strict Noether symmetry that is a kind of symmetry in which LX= 0, where
LXindicates the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian arises from the metric of interest along a vector ﬁeld X[45–49].
On the other hand, the Noether symmetry approach with a gauge t erm known as Noether gauge symmetry is the
generalization of strict Noether symmetry in the sense that the No ether symmetry equation includes a divergence of
a functional boundary term referred to the gauge function [50–5 4]. Both approaches are useful in a variety of physical
problems as well as applied mathematical ones. However, the key po int is that which approach leads to a conserved
quantity. The advantage of Noether gauge symmetries is that it dir ectly gives conserved quantities or conservation
laws [26]. This is while the strict Noether symmetry approach express es the relationship between Noether’s theorem
and cyclic variable. Although the conserved quantities are also relat ed to the existence of cyclic variables into the
dynamics by the strict Noether symmetry, there is an ambiguity in th e choice of cyclic variables and it is usually
required a clever choice of them. Therefore, the equations for th e change of coordinates have not a unique solution.
Recently, concerning the non-minimal f(R)-matter couplings and in the context of strict Noether symmetry , the
general couplings in Y(R)F2form were discussed in [55]. Here, we use the Noether gauge symme try approach
to study the existence of Noether symmetries of gravitational th eories which involved non-minimal coupling with
electromagnetic ﬁeld. We try to determine possible symmetries as we ll as corresponding conserved quantities and
evaluate exact solutions for a particular non-minimal model, i.e. RβF2.
This paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we consider t he general non-minimal coupling between
electromagneticﬁeld and modiﬁed gravityin the form of Y(R)F2and try to obtain the system ofdiﬀerential equations
using Noether gauge symmetry approach. In Sec. III, we extrac t the exact black hole solution and its symmetries
and investigate the geometrical properties of the obtained black h ole solution. Section IV is devoted to study the
thermodynamical properties of the solution. We calculate the ther modynamic quantities and examine the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics. We also explore the stability and thermal phase tr ansition of the solutions. In the conclusion part,
we give a summary and some concluding remarks. Finally, in Appendix A, we provide a brief review of the Noether
gauge symmetry approach as complementary information.
II. SYSTEM OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS COMING FROM NOETHER SY MMETRY
CONDITION FOR THE NON-MINIMAL MODEL
In this section, we consider the non-minimal coupling between electr omagnetic ﬁeld and gravity in the form of
Y(R)F2which may arise in the presence of a medium with very high density elect romagnetic ﬁeld and their eﬀects
can be signiﬁcant even far from the source [13]. The action for the m entioned non-minimal model can be expressed
as
S=/integraldisplay

, (1)
whereκ2is the universal Newtonian coupling constant of gravity and F≡FµνFµνin which Fµνis the Faraday
tensor which is constructed using the U(1) gauge ﬁeld AνasFµν= 2∂[µAν]. Regarding the spherically symmetric

where the prime (′) represents the derivative with respect to r.
Here, we use the gauge Noether symmetry approach given in Appen dix A to ﬁnd an exact solution. To this end,
canonical Lagrangian plays an important role. To construct the ca nonical Lagrangian for the considered metric 2, we
choose the suitable Lagrange multiplier and after integrating by par ts, the Lagrangian Lbecomes canonical. Thus
the point-like canonical Lagrangian is derived as follows [55]

where we have assumed that the electromagnetic tensor has only t he electric potential φ(r), i.e.Aµ(r) = (φ(r),0,0,0).
The conﬁguration space of (4) is Qwhich has the generalized coordinates qi≡ {f,B,φ,R}and its tangent space
TQ≡ {qi,q′i}. Using the Euler-Lagrange equations

By inserting the Ricci scalar Rgiven by (3) into the above Eqs. (6)-(9), one can easily verify that variational ﬁeld
equations are equivalent with those obtained from the tensorial fo rm of the ﬁeld equation.
Taking into account the variables of the conﬁguration space, the N oether symmetry generator will be as follows
X=ξ(r,f,B,φ, R)∂r+η1∂f+η2∂B+η3∂φ+η4∂R, (10)
whereηi=ηi(r,f,B,φ, R). Using Eqs. (A15)-(A18) and imposing the Noether symmetry con dition A19
X[1]L+L(Dtξ) =Dth, (11)
for the canonical Lagrangian (4), we obtain the following system of partial diﬀerential equations
ξ,f= 0, ξ,B= 0, ξ,R= 0, ξ,φ= 0,

wherehdenotes the gauge function (see Appendix A for more detail). The a bove system clearly depends on the form
of the function Y(R) and so, by solving it, one can get a wide class of non-minimal models wh ich are compatible with
spherical symmetry. In the following, we will consider a special case ofY(R) to search the Noether symmetries.4
III. NON-MINIMAL RβF2-COUPLED ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD TO GRAVITY
In this section, by choosing a functional form of the non-minimal co upling between the electromagnetic ﬁeld and
gravity, i.e. RβF2, we try to obtain an exact solution with black hole interpretation. Th en, we investigate some
geometrical properties of the black hole solution.
A. The exact solution and its symmetry
It follows from the Noether symmetry equations given by (12) that for an arbitrary form of the function Y(R), the
system of partial diﬀerential equations reduces to the following eq uations
ξ,f= 0, ξ,B= 0, ξ,R= 0, ξ,φ= 0,
η1,R= 0, η1,φ= 0,
η2,f= 0, η2,R= 0, η2,φ= 0,

Solving the above diﬀerential equations show that the components of the Noether generator Xare

which yields ﬁveNoether symmetries as
X1=3
2r∂r+ 3f ∂f−3
2B∂B+φ∂φ,
X2=∂r, X3=∂φ,
X4=rB−κ
2∂f,X5=B−κ

with the following Lie algebra
[X2,X1] =3
2X2,[X3,X1] =X3,[X4,X1] = (6−3κ
4)X4,
[X5,X1] = (3−3κ
4)X5,[X2,X4] =X5. (16)
Then the corresponding ﬁrst integrals of X1,X2,X3,X4andX5are

whereI1,I2,I3,I4andI5are constants of motion. It is notable that the integration consta ntI3corresponds to the
electric charge of the source which is determined by the Gauss integ ral
q=1
4π/integraldisplay
S2√−gY(R)FµνdSµν, (18)
which clearly represents the relation between the electric charge a nd the spacetime curvature. It is also possible to
ﬁnd solutions to the Noether symmetry equations (12) for some sp eciﬁc functions of Y(R).
Let us consider the function Y(R) in the following form
Y(R) =1
1−(a0R)β, (19)
wherea0is a coupling constant with dimension [ L]2andβis a real number. This type of non-minimal couplings
between electromagnetic ﬁeld and gravity was ﬁrst proposed by T. Dereli et. al. in [13]. They derived the ﬁeld
equations by a ﬁrst order variational principle using the method of L agrange multipliers for the spherically symmetric
static metric [13]. Here, we also try to ﬁnd the solutions from Noethe r symmetry approach. In other words, we
investigate the possible Noether symmetries of the spherically symm etric solution for this non-minimal model.
We ﬁnd from the system (12) that the components of the Noether generator Xfor this case are
ξ=c1r+c2, η1= 2c1f+ (c3r+c4)B−κ
2, η2=−c1B, η 3=2
3c1φ+c5, η4= 0,
h=2
κ2c1r−2
κ2(κ−2)c3B(1−κ
2)+c6. (20)
Hence, we arrive at the following Noether symmetries
X1=r∂r+ 2f ∂f−B∂B+2
3φ∂φ,
X2=∂r, X3=∂φ,
X4=rB−κ
2∂f,X5=B−κ
2∂f, (21)
which gives rise to the ﬁrst integrals as
I1=f B′
κ2−Bf′
κ2+I3φ−2
κ2r
I2= 0, I 3= 2BY(R)φ′
I4=rI5+2
κ2(κ−2)B(1−κ

I5=B′
κ2B−κ
2. (22)
Also, the corresponding Lie algebra of Noether symmetries has the following non-vanishing commutators
[X2,X1] =X2,[X3,X1] =X3,[X4,X1] = (1−κ
2)X4,
[X5,X1] = (2−κ
2)X5,[X2,X4] =X5. (23)
In what follows, we will use the above Noether symmetries to derive e xact solutions for this non-minimal model.
Before going further, it should be mentioned that since the equatio n of motion (6), describing the evolution of the
metric potential B, does not depend on the other coordinates, it can be explicitly solve d in terms of B. Thus, this
metric function will be obtained as follows
B(r) =b1(r+b2)2. (24)
whereb1andb2are the integration constants. Without loss of generality, we choo seB(r) =r2and ﬁnd that the
Noether symmetry generators (22) result in the following constan ts of motion
I1=2fr
κ2−r2f′
κ2+I3φ−2
κ2r
I2= 0, I 3= 2r2Y(R)φ′, (25)6
Considering (18), we can set I3=−4qand then by solving the system of diﬀerential equation, we ﬁnd that

whereC1=/parenleftbig

1−βis the integration constants. Going back to minimally coupled Einstein- Maxwell ﬁeld
equations and checking the solution, we ﬁnd that the constant of m otionI1has a dimension of mass. It is important
to mention that the metric function (26) that we get from the Noet her symmetry approach is completely in agreement
with the one that obtained using the method of Lagrange multipliers in [13]. Regarding the excluding values of β, we
ﬁnd that by considering the function Y(R) in the form of (19) for β= 1 and−1
3and solving the system of diﬀerential
equations (25) the following solutions will be obtained
•β= 1:
φ(r) =4q

f(r) = 1+I1κ2

An important point that matters concerned with the obtained solut ion is the fact that we expect to get the Reissner-
Nordstr¨ om (RN) solution in the asymptotic behavior of parameter a0. In this way, the obtained solution for β= 1
satisﬁes the expected behavior. However, the solution regarding β=−1
3does not meet the well-behaved asymptotic
RN behavior and hence we do not consider it as an appropriate solutio n for the theory. In the following, we will study
the obtained solution of the theory for β/ne}ationslash= 0,1,−1
3.
Before going further, it is worth mentioning one point concerning th e physical importance of the obtained solution.
Indeed, choosing some special values of parameters can result in e xplaining the eﬀects of dark matter. Let us consider
the region where ris large. Hence, for −1< β <−1
3, the last term of f(r) in (26) dominates and we can approximate
f(r) as
f(r)≈1−Cr−γ, (29)
whereC=C1(β−1)2
4a0β(3β+1)andγ=2β+2
1−β. One can choose some values of parameters βanda0such that we have C<0
and 0< γ <1. Therefore, (29) shows that the matter particle experiences t he potential proportional to r−γ, which
means the force strength is proportional to r−1−γ.C<0 guarantees the force is attractive and for 0 < γ <1 the
force is stronger than the one produced by Newton’s potential fo r larger. Hence, these solutions might explain the
rotation curves of the galaxies and some eﬀects of dark matter.
B. Properties of the solution
Here, we investigate diﬀerent properties of the obtained metric fu nction (26). Before we start, it should be noted
that the existence of (singular) black holes has two conditions: the presence of curvature singularity and the existence
of an event horizon covering it. To begin with, we examine the existen ce of the singularity for the obtained solutions.
In this regard, we calculate the Kretschmann scalar and ﬁnd that

whereA= 2(3β+ 1)2β2a02[256βa0q2]1/(β−1)andB= 3β4+ 2β3+ 10β2+ 10β+ 7. According to this relation,
we ﬁnd that the Kretschmann scalar diverges at the origin, and hen ce, there is a curvature singularity located at
r= 0. However, the asymptotic behavior of this curvature invariant at inﬁnity depends on the value of parameter β
as follows
lim
r→∞K=

0β <1

Besides, studying the behavior of the Kretschmann invariant in larg eβshows that the curvature of spacetime has
a nonzero ﬁnite value when rgoes to inﬁnity:

. (32)
Now, we try to study some physical properties of the solution in spe cial case. First of all, the basic features of the
spacetime geometry is completely dependent on the value of the par ameterβ:
•The obtained solution tends to the Schwarzschild solution for q= 0 and β <1.
•This solution is asymptotically ﬂat for the values of β/ne}ationslash= 0,−1
3in the range of −1< β <1. For this case, the
behaviorof f(r) is sketched for diﬀerent model parametersin Figs 1. According to these ﬁgures one ﬁnds that by
selecting the value of parameter βfrom the mentioned interval and depending on the other metric par ameters,
this solution could represent a black hole with two horizons, an extre me black hole with a degenerate horizon
or a naked singularity.

FIG. 1: Behavior of f(r) with respect to r8
•Regarding β <−1, the solution is neither asymptotically ﬂat nor (A)dS. Strictly spea king, although the
Kretschmann scalar vanishes in large r, the metric function is not asymptotically ﬂat due to the fourth ter m of
Eq. (26) which leads f(r) to tend to inﬁnity as r→ ∞. The behavior of the corresponding metric function has
been shown in Fig. 2. Regarding this ﬁgure, we ﬁnd that increasing (d ecreasing) the value of parameter m, (q)
leads to changing the number of horizons from zero to two.
•Choosing the parameter βin the range of β >1 results in black holes with cosmological horizon. Indeed,
solution with this condition meets the de Sitter (dS)-like behavior at r→ ∞. Also, depending on the other
metric parameters, the corresponding black hole could admit up to t hree horizons: a cosmological horizon r++,
a black hole horizon r+, and an internal horizon r−. To be more clear, we have provided Fig. 3 in which
the behavior of the metric function in terms of rhas been plotted for a set of model parameters. However,
the number of horizon can change by varying the values of model pa rameters which are depicted in Figs. 4.
According to this ﬁgures, two horizons r−andr+coincide at a certain value of parameters. Besides, for another
set of model parameters, the other two horizons r+andr++will coincide each other. We also investigate the
eﬀect of increasing the value of parameters a0andβon the geometric feature of the spacetime. To this regard,
we have provided Figs 5. As it is clear from these ﬁgures, increasing ( decreasing) the value of a0, (β) leads to
increasing the number of horizon from one to two (two to three).

IV. BLACK HOLE THERMODYNAMICS AND THERMAL STABILITY
One of the most important steps in the transition from the classic as pect of gravitation to quantum gravity is
analyzing black hole thermodynamics. To study the thermodynamic p roperties of the solution, the starting point is
the temperature calculation. The Hawking temperature of the blac k holes at the event horizon r+can be obtained
through the surface gravity interpretation [56]

The typical behavior of temperature is depicted in Figs. 6 and 7 for d iﬀerent parameters of our model. Calculations
show that for the negative values of a0andβthe temperature is not positive for all horizon radii, and therefore , there
will be a constrain on the r+to have the physical solution as it is shown in Fig. 6. Besides, the eﬀec t of changing
the parameter qhas been investigated for this case. As shown in this ﬁgure, by incre asingq, the starting point of
physically acceptable range of black hole will be at a larger horizon rad ius. Concerning the positive values of a0and
β, we ﬁnd that depending on the parameters βandq, the positive range of temperature can change. According to
Fig. 7, it is shown that we encounter to three diﬀerent cases: the H awking temperature can be positive everywhere,
it can be limited to a speciﬁc range, or we have no acceptable physical range.
The next interesting quantity in black hole thermodynamic context is entropy that can be obtained by using the10

area law in the case of Einsteinian black holes [57, 58]. Therefore, the entropy of the obtained black hole becomes
S=πr2
+. (34)
Here, it is necessary to pause and explain about using the area law re lation for the entropy; Indeed, the direct
coupling between matter and geometry components results in the f act that the matter stress tensor is no longer
conserved and there is an energy transfer between the two comp onents. To be more clear, one can get the ﬁeld
equation for the action (II). Variation with respect to the metric gµνyields the modiﬁed Einstein equations of motion
as follows

in which the matter energy-momentum tensor is, as usually, deﬁned by
Tµν=−2√−g/parenleftbig√−gF2/parenrightbig
gµν. (36)
Now, taking into account the covariant derivative of the obtained ﬁ eld equation and the Bianchi identities as well as
the identity ( /square∇ν−∇ν/square)YR(R) =Rµν∇µYR(R), imply the non-(covariant) conservation law

and, as expected, in the limit YR(R) = 1, one recovers the conservation law ∇µTµν= 0. Due to the energy transfer
between the two components, the system will be a dynamical syste m. It has been shown that one way to investigate
the thermodynamic properties of dynamical black hole is working in th e limit of weak gravity and consider the non-
minimal term as a perturbation around the Einstein gravity, known a s the linearized amplitude expansion [59]. In
the context of the ﬁeld equation, , we can recast the ﬁeld equation (35) in a way that the higher order corrections are
written as an energy-momentum tensor of geometrical origin desc ribing an eﬀective source term on the right hand
side of the standard Einstein ﬁeld equations, namely
Gµν=Tm

. (40)
Therefore, it seems reasonable to use area law formula for the ent ropy of the black hole in this model and examine it
via the ﬁrst law and Smarr formula.12
In order to calculate the electric potential of the black hole, we use the fact that it is the electrostatic potential
diﬀerence between the horizon and the boundary at inﬁnity [60]
Φ =Aµχµ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
r→∞−Aµχµ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
r=r+. (41)
Hence, by considering the Killing vector χµ= (−1,0,0,0) as the null generator of the horizon, the electric potential
of the black hole is obtained as follows
Φ(r+) =4q
r++C1β−1
3β+1r3β+1

Moreover, for obtaining the mass of solution, one can evaluate the metric function on its event horizon f(r=r+) = 0
which results in the following relation for our black hole solution
M(r+,q) =r+

Now, it is logical to examine the validity of the ﬁrst law of black hole ther modynamics and the Smarr formula for
the obtained black hole. It is a matter of calculation to show the Smar r formula is
M= 2TS+ΦQ+2Va0, (43)
where the electric charge per unit volume Qcan be found by calculating the ﬂux of the electric ﬁeld at inﬁnity which
yieldsQ=q/4π. Besides, this relation states that in addition to SandQ,a0is also a thermodynamic variable which
its conjugate will be as follows

Havingconservedand thermodynamicquantities, it s easytoshowt hat the obtainedthermodynamic quantities satisfy
the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
dM=TdS+ΦdQ+Vda0. (45)
As a next step, we are going to investigate thermal stability and look for possible phase transition of our solution.
In the canonical ensemble, the positivity of heat capacity ensures the local stability in regions where black hole
temperature is positive, while the opposite stands for the unstable black holes which may undergo phase transition
to be stabilized. Regarding the obtained black hole solution, the heat capacity function is calculated as

It is well known that in the presence of positive temperature, the p oints at which black hole heat capacity diverges
(vanishes) may correspond to the phase transition. Since the tem perature is a smooth polynomial function and does
not blow up, the divergence point of heat capacity is located at the p oints of vanishing its denominator. For arbitrary
values of βit is not possible to ﬁnd, analytically, the root(s) of heat capacity an d its denominator, and therefore, we
have to provide numerical analysis as is shown in Figs. 8 for more deta ils.
Regarding the positive numbers of parameters a0andβ, the heat capacity experiences one divergence point in the
presence of positive T(see Fig. 8). We call this special point as r+d. Therefore, if the radius of the event horizon
is between root of temperature and the divergence point of the he at capacity, the black hole is thermally stable and
meets a necessary criterion for viable solutions. On the other hand , black holes whose horizon radius are larger than
r+dexperience the negative heat capacity which means that a phase tr ansition occurs at r+=r+dbetween physical
and unphysical black holes. The mentioned admissible domain of the bla ck hole can be altered by changing the model
parameter a0. According to Fig. 8(c), increasing the values of this parameter lea ds to make the admissible domain
larger. However, in the case of negative numbers of parameters a0andβ, the heat capacity meets two divergences. It
shows that black hole with these parameters experiences a second order phase transition [61] between small and large
ones. Therefore, middle black holes are not allowed for this class of p arameters.13
Now, by calculating the free energy of the system, we complete our discussion on criticality. The free energy can
be obtained using the Legendre transformation or calculating the o n-shell action as follows

The qualitative behavior of free energy as a function of temperatu re is depicted in the Fig. 9.
(a)β=−1,q= 0.07 (b)β=−10
FIG. 9: Behavior of the free energy with respect to temperatu re fora0=−1 andβ=−10
According to Fig. (9), one can see diﬀerent behavior of free energ y depending on the metric parameters. Fig. (9(a))
is plotted according to metric parameters of Fig. (8(a)) which show s that free energy is multi-valued when horizon
radius belongs the interval (0 .2< r+<0.3). It is notable that in the mentioned interval the heat capacity div erges
and it changes to negative value. On the other hand, Fig. (9(b)) sh ows that the energy is single-valued for large
values of charge parameter and decreases monotonically with the in creasing temperature and is locally stable. In the
case of small q, it becomes multi-valued which is famous as swallow-tail behavior that indicating a ﬁrst order phase
transition between small and large black holes. It is more or less the s ame as van der Waals ﬂuid which in our system
occurs for smaller values of charge parameter. The blue curve indic ates a second-order phase transition where Ais
single-valued and continuous, but is non-analytic (diﬀerentiable eve rywhere).
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied the black hole solution of a particular m odel of non-minimally coupled gravity
to electromagnetic as Y(R)F2. For an arbitrary Y(R), we have used the Noether symmetry approach to ﬁnd ﬁve
generators and related symmetries with corresponding Lie algebra . Then, we have chosen a special class of Y(R),
and obtained diﬀerent generators and related Lie algebra.
Regarding the Noether symmetry approach, we have found exact solutions of the non-minimal gauge-gravity cou-
pling with black hole interpretation. The paper was concentrated on two aspects of these black holes including
solutions and geometrical properties as well as thermodynamic beh avior and possible phase transition.
We have considered RβF2type non-minimal coupling between gravity and electromagnetic ﬁeld . By using the
Noether gauge symmetry approach, we have investigated the pos sible symmetries as well as corresponding conserved
quantities to ﬁnd the exact solutions for this model. The exact metr ic function was obtained and it was shown that:
I) The Kretschmann scalar admitted the existence of singularity. I I) Depending on the values of the model parameters
β,a0,qandm, the obtained solution could enjoy from zero up to three roots for the metric function.

Appendix A: A Review on Noether Gauge symmetry approach
Noether symmetry which is deﬁned in the context of dynamical syst ems provides a fascinating procedure to ﬁnd
symmetries of diﬀerential equations and use them to derive an exac t analytic solution of proposed models at a
fundamental level, including modiﬁed gravity theories. This approac h opens the way to ﬁnd the solution either by
reducing the dynamic system’s degrees of freedom or determining t he unknown functions of the system. The aim of
this appendix is to provide a brief overview on this approach.
To begin with, we consider the one parameter point transformation , also called coordinate transformation,
(x,y)→(¯x,¯y) (A1)
in which
¯x= ¯x(x,y;ε),¯y= ¯y(x,y;ε). (A2)
whereεis an arbitrary real parameter. The ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion of the inﬁnitesimal transformation (A2)
aroundε= 0 yields
¯x(x,y;ε) =x+ε∂¯x
∂ε/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
ε=0=x+εξ(x,y) (A3)
¯y(x,y;ε) =y+ε∂¯y
∂ε/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
ε=0=y+εη(x,y). (A4)
where the functions ξ(x,y),η(x,y), which is called the inﬁnitesimal generator of the transformation, are the compo-
nents of the tangent vector X,i.e.
X=ξ(x,y)∂
∂x+η(x,y)∂
∂y. (A5)
Since our goal is to see how diﬀerential equations are aﬀected by th ese transformations, we have to extend/prolong
them to the derivatives. Therefore, by means of the following relat ions
¯y′≡d¯y(x,y;ε)
d¯x(x,y;ε)=y′(∂¯y/∂y)+(∂¯y/∂x)
y′(∂¯x/∂y)+(∂¯x/∂x)= ¯y′(x,y,y′;ε), (A6)
¯y′′≡d¯y′
d¯x= ¯y′′(x,y,y′,y′′;ε), (A7)
...
the prolongation/extensionof the tangent vector, involving the nthderivatives, can be computed. Using the ﬁrst-order
Taylor expanding around ε= 0 and substituting Eqs. (A3) and (A4) into Eqs. (A6) and (A7), th enthderivatives of
the transformed coordinates are obtained as follows
¯y′=y′+ε/parenleftbiggdη
dx−y′dξ
dx/parenrightbigg
=y′+εη[1], (A8)
...
¯y(n)=y(n)+ε/parenleftbiggdη(n−1)
dx−y(n)dξ
dx/parenrightbigg
=y(n)+εη[n], (A9)
where
η[n]≡dη(n−1)
dx−y(n)dξ
dx=dn
dxn(η−y′ξ)+y(n+1)ξ (A10)15
is thenthprolongation function of η. Therefore, the nthprolongation of the generator Xreads
X[n]=X+η[1]∂y′+...+η[n]∂y(n). (A11)
It is worth mentioning that we referred only to one parameter point transformations so far. However, the procedure
followed to deﬁne multi parameter point transformations on variab les, their derivatives, as well as their generators, is
the same.
Now, we are ready to study the behavior of diﬀerential equation un der the action of point transformations. A group
of point transformations that maps solutions into another solution s is called a symmetry of the diﬀerential equations.
A speciﬁc class of Lie point symmetries are the so-called Noether sym metries. They are restricted to dynamical
systems coming from a Lagrangian. The Lagrangian function L=L(t,qi,˙qi)1, is a function of time t, the generalized
coordinates qi=qi(t) and their time derivatives ˙ qi(t) which contains information about the dynamics of a system.
Having the Lagrangian function in hand, the system’s equations of m otion are given by the Euler-Lagrange equations
d
dt/parenleftbigg∂L
∂˙qi/parenrightbigg
−∂L
∂qi= 0. (A12)
where it is obtained by the variation of the action integral
A(qi,˙qi) =/integraldisplayt2
t1L(t,qi,˙qi)dt. (A13)
Noether symmetries use the fact that when we add a total derivat ive to the Lagrangian
A′(q′i,˙q′i) =A(qi,˙qi)+/integraldisplayt2
t1dh(t,qi,˙qi)
dtdt (A14)
the equations of motion do not change and therefore, the set of s olutions remains the same. The function his called
the Noether or the gauge function.
The Lagrangian-related Noether vector Xand the ﬁrst prolongation vector ﬁeld X[1]can be built as follows
XL=ξ(t,qk)∂L
∂t+ηi(t,qk)∂L
∂qi, (A15)
X[1]L=XL+ ˙ηk(t,ql,˙ql)∂L
∂˙qk, (A16)
where
˙ηk(t,ql,˙ql) =Dtηk−˙qkDtξ, (A17)
and
Dt=∂/∂t+ ˙qk∂/∂qk, (A18)
is the total derivative operator. In this regard, the vector Xwill act as a symmetry generator that constructs the
conserved quantities if there exists a gauge function, h(t,qk), such that
X[1]L+L(Dtξ) =Dth. (A19)
The signiﬁcance of Noether symmetry comes from the following ﬁrst integral of motion which asserts that if Xis the
Noether symmetry generator corresponding to the Lagrangian L(t,qi,˙qi), the conserved quantity associated with this
generator will be as follows
I=−ξEL+ηi∂L
∂˙qi−h,

whereELis the energy functional or the Hamiltonian of the Lagrangian Lwhich is deﬁned by
EL= ˙qi∂L
∂˙qi−L. (A20)
As a ﬁnal comment, it should be mentioned that the ﬁrst integral pla ys a remarkable role to obtain physically viable
solutions for the theory’s system of diﬀerential equations.
