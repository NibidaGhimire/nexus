In this paper, we report the bifurcations of mode-locked periodic orbits occurring in maps of three or higher
dimensions. The ‘torus’ is represented by a closed loop in discrete time, which contains stable and unstable
cycles of the same periodicity, and the unstable manifolds of the saddle. We investigate two types of ‘doubling’
of such loops: in (a) two disjoint loops are created and the iterates toggle between them, and in (b) the length
of the closed invariant curve is doubled. Our work supports the conjecture of Gardini and Sushko, which says
that the type of bifurcation depends on the sign of the third eigenvalue. We also report the situation arising
out of Neimark-Sacker bifurcation of the stable and saddle cycles, which creates cyclic closed invariant curves.
We show interesting types of saddle-node connection structures, which emerge for parameter values where the
stable ﬁxed point has bifurcated but the saddle has not, and vice versa.
I. INTRODUCTION
Mode-locked periodic orbits occur when a dynamical sys-
tem has two commensurate frequencies that are not harmoni-
cally related to each other. Such cycles always occur as stable-
unstable pairs, and are located on a closed invariant curve
formed by the unstable manifolds of the saddle. Such closed
invariant curves occurring in maps represent tori in continu-
ous time. In this paper we investigate bifurcations of such
‘resonant tori’ in three-dimensional maps.
Much of the earlier work on the bifurcation of tori fo-
cused on ergodic tori or quasiperiodic orbits. The doubling
of quasiperiodic orbits was ﬁrst reported by Kaneko [1] and
Arneodo et al. [2] in the dynamics of some three- and four-
dimensional maps. Since then, such bifurcations have been re-
ported in maps resulting from the discretization of continuous-
time systems such as impulsive Goodwin’s oscillator [3],
3-dimensional Lotka-V olterra model [4, 5], vibro-impacting
systems [6], four coupled oscillators [7], radiophysical sys-
tems [8], etc. Sekikawa et al. demonstrated a sequence of
length-doublings [9, 10] ﬁnally resulting in chaos.
Torus doubling critical point is a special point in the pa-
rameter space where the regions of occurrence of torus, dou-
bled torus, and strange non-chaotic attractor meet. Such crit-
ical points were found in a nonlinear electronic circuit with
quasiperiodic drive [11]. Scaling laws applicable in the vicin-
ity of a critical point were obtained for a forced logistic map
[12].
For a better understanding on the bifurcations of invari-
ant tori, iterative schemes for computation and continuation
of two-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds of mode-
locked orbits were proposed in [13, 14]. In piecewise-smooth
maps, the birth of a bilayered torus via border-collision bifur-
cation was reported in [15] and bifurcation of such a torus via
heteroclinic tangencies was discussed. Recently, a review on
the dynamical consequences of torus doublings resulting in
the formation of Shilnikov attractors were discussed in [16].
After Grebogi, Ott and Yorke [17] showed that three-
frequency quasiperiodicity can be stable over a parameterrange, its occurrence, observed in the form of a torus in the
discrete-time phase space, has been reported in many sys-
tems including symmetrical rigid tops [18], vibro-impacting
systems [19], four coupled Chua’s circuits [20], a simple au-
tonomous system [21], and a ladder of four coupled van der
Pol oscillators [22].
The merger and disappearance of a stable and an unstable
closed invariant curves was found to be responsible for the
creation of strange nonchaotic attractors [23–25]. Behaviors
close to tori-collision terminal points were studied in [26].
These observations have been summarized in [4], by show-
ing that a stable quasiperiodic orbit can bifurcate in four pos-
sible ways. These are illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1(a) and (b)
show two ways of ‘doubling’: in (a) two disjoint loops are
created and the iterates toggle between them, and in (b) the
length of the closed invariant curve is doubled. The bifurca-
tion shown in Fig. 1(c) leads to a torus in discrete time which
represents three-frequency quasiperiodicity. Fig. 1(d) shows a
situation where a stable and an unstable tori merge and disap-

pear (or are created if the parameter is varied in the opposite
direction). Banerjee et al. explained these bifurcations based
on the method of ‘second Poincaré section’ [4].
The above lines of work concern bifurcations of quasiperi-
odic orbits. However, mode-locked periodic orbits represent a
generic case. Such orbits possess rational rotational numbers
and appear as shrimp shaped regions in two-dimensional pa-
rameter space [27] that cover a larger range of parameters than
the quasiperiodic orbit. Therefore, in this paper we explore the
ways in which mode-locked periodic orbits may bifurcate.
Although much research has been done on the doubling of
quasiperiodic orbits, much less research attention has been de-
voted to the doubling of resonant tori or mode-locked periodic
orbits. Gardini and Sushko [28] proposed a conjecture regard-
ing the conditions for different types of doubling bifurcations
of closed invariant curves related to mode-locked periodic or-
bits. However, to date these have not been tested using sys-
tems that exhibit these bifurcations. In this paper we ﬁll that
gap and validate their conjecture.
We also explore the birth of a third frequency in a mode-
locked periodic orbit, which results in the occurrence of more
than two closed invariant curves in the phase space and the
iterates cyclically move among them.
Both types of torus doubling are related to the occurrence of
period doubling bifurcation and the birth of multiple loops is
related to the occurrence of a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation in a
ﬁxed point. Since a saddle cycle as well as a stable cycle occur
on the closed invariant curve, an interesting situation emerges:
it is possible that one of them undergoes a bifurcation but the
other does not. Such situations lead to atypical structures of
the closed invariant curve, which are also reported in this pa-
per.
The paper is organized as follows: In §II, we recapitulate
the conjecture and discuss the mechanism behind the dou-
bling of mode-locked orbits in three-dimensional maps. In
§III, we give an example of the doubling phenomenon of
a mode-locked periodic orbit in a three-dimensional smooth
map where two disjoint loops are formed. In §IV, we provide
example of the case where the length of manifold doubles and
they lie on a non-orientable Möbius strip. In §VII, collision of
two closed invariant curves formed out of a saddle-node con-
nection and a saddle-saddle connection is discussed. §VIII
presents the conclusions and future research questions arising
out of this paper.
II. QUALITATIVE THEORY OF DOUBLING OF
MODE-LOCKED ORBIT
Closed invariant curves are born through Neimark-Sacker
bifurcation of a stable ﬁxed point. This can lead to a few sce-
narios:
1. A supercritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation leading to
the formation of a stable closed invariant curve.
(a) There are a dense set of points on the curve, which
implies an irrational frequency ratio. This leads to
the formation of a quasiperiodic orbit.(b) There are a ﬁnite number of stable and saddle
points and the invariant closed curve is composed
of a union of these points and the unstable mani-
folds of the saddle points. This leads to the forma-
tion of a mode-locked periodic orbit.
2. A subcritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation leading to an
unstable closed invariant curve.
(a) The unstable closed invariant curve may be a
quasiperiodic orbit;
(b) The unstable closed invariant curve may be a
mode-locked periodic orbit.
In this paper we consider the bifurcations of a closed invari-
ant curve related to Case 1(b).
Let us consider a three-dimensional map with a stable cy-
cle (say CN) and saddle cycle (say CS). The union of these
points and the unstable manifolds of the saddle cycles form
the closed invariant curve (see Fig. 2). Let us denote the eigen-
values of the stable periodic orbit as lN
i,i=1;2;3 and the
eigenvalues of the saddle periodic orbit as lS
i,i=1;2;3.

FIG. 2. Schematic structure of a closed invariant curve for a mode-
locked periodic orbit. The stable cycle is marked by blue triangles
and the saddles by red rectangles. The directions associated with
eigenvalues 1, 2 and 3 of the stable cycle are shown for one of the
points.
In order for the closed invariant curve to exist, one of the
three eigenvalues must be positive. Let the positive eigenval-
ues be denoted by lN
1;lS
1for the node and saddle periodic
points, respectively. The corresponding stable manifolds of
the nodes and the unstable manifolds of the saddles form the
saddle-node connections on the closed invariant curve.
Following [28], let us ﬁrst consider the case of doubling of
the closed invariant curve. In order for a doubling to occur,
there must be a ﬂip bifurcation, i.e., one of the eigenvalues
should pass through  1. Let this eigenvalue be denoted as lN
2
for the node and as lS
2for the saddle. These eigenvalues, asso-
ciated with the saddle and the node, need not pass through  1
at the same parameter value. Indeed, the saddle and the node
can undergo ﬂip bifurcation at different parameter values. We
will see this in two explicit examples considered later in this
paper.
Consider a situation where both the saddle CSand the node
CNhave undergone ﬂip bifurcation (see Fig. 3). A dou-
bled stable orbit (say C2N) has emanated from CN, which has
turned into a ﬂip-saddle with one unstable direction. A sim-
ilar scenario occurs with the saddle periodic point CS, which3
doubles by making another of its branches unstable (two in-
dependent unstable directions). Two saddle points (say C2S)
emanate on both sides of the previous saddle ( CS). Two dis-
tinctly different stable behaviors can result from this bifurca-
tion. Gardini and Sushko [28] conjectured that the shape of
the resulting manifold is determined by the third eigenvalue
lN
3;lS
3. The sign of the third eigenvalue classiﬁes the bifurca-
tion into two types.
A. Positive third eigenvalue ( lN
3>0;lS
3>0)
If the third eigenvalue associated is positive, then the trajec-
tories will be converging on one side of the manifold and will
give a geometric structure like Fig. 3(a). This leads to the for-
mation of two disjoint cycles G2a;G2b. We note that the two
disjoint cycles are cyclically invariant, i.e., the trajectory on
the periodic orbits toggle between the upper cycle G2aand the
lower cycle G2b. The two disjoint closed loops are invariant in
the sense that they act as a single loop for the second iterate
of the map.
The two attracting disjoint cycles bound a strip or a man-
ifold whose shape is topologically a cylinder. The mani-
fold (topological cylinder) consists of the unstable closed cy-
cleGand the two stable disjoint cycles G2a, and G2b. The
cylinder manifold is orientable. Each of the node and sad-
dle periodic points ( CN;CS;C2N;C2S) have three independent
eigen-directions, which are represented in Fig. 3 with different
colours.
B. Negative third eigenvalue ( lN
3<0;lS
3<0)
If the third eigenvalue is negative, the shape of the invariant
set is a Möbius strip (a non-orientable manifold). The bound-
ary of the Möbius strip constitutes the saddle-node connection
of the doubled saddle and node mode-locked periodic orbits.
This is qualitatively shown in Fig. 3(a).
We now illustrate the above bifurcations with a few exam-
ples.
III. EXAMPLE: DISJOINT TWO-LOOP MODE-LOCKED
ORBIT
In this section we consider the Mira map studied in [29],
which is a three-dimensional map given by
x0=y;
y0=z;
z0=Bx+Cy+Az y2;(1)
The Jacobian of the map (1) is
J=2
40 1 0
0 0 1
B C 2y A3
5; (2)whose determinant is det (J) =B. For B<0, the map is
orientation-reversing everywhere, and for B>0, the map is
orientation-preserving everywhere. We have observed dis-
joint two-loop mode-locked periodic orbit in the orientation-
reversing regime. In [22], authors have mentioned that such
disjoint doublings of quasiperiodic orbit can be found in
orientation-preserving systems as well but in higher dimen-
sional systems of dimensions greater than or equal to four.
From the one-parameter bifurcation diagram with the vari-
ation of parameter B, see Fig. 4(a), we observe that a ﬁxed
point undergoes a Hopf bifurcation to a quasiperiodic orbit
and then through a saddle-node bifurcation, a mode-locked
period-ﬁve orbit is formed. It then doubles to a period-10
mode-locked orbit. With further increase in the parameter B,
we observe subsequent doublings of mode-locked orbit, after
which it transits to chaos.
The doubling of the mode-locked orbit can be better under-
stood when we continue the saddle and stable mode-locked
periodic orbits with respect to the parameter B. We have used
the multidimensional Newton-Raphson method to locate the
saddle cycle. Fig. 4(b) shows that the saddle doubles ﬁrst,
followed by the doubling of the node. The computation of the
eigenvalues over the same parameter range of a(see Fig. 5)
reveals that, as the parameter Bincreases, the second eigen-
value reaches 1 atB= 0:5627. In Fig. 5(b), we see that
the second eigenvalue of the node reaches  1 atB= 0:55
and hence the stable period-ﬁve orbit bifurcates to a period-ten
orbit.
AtB= 0:58, a stable period-5 mode-locked orbit exists
along with a period-5 saddle. We compute the unstable man-
ifolds of the saddle cycle using the method of fundamental
domains [30], which form a saddle-node connection. The re-
sulting invariant closed curve is shown in Fig. 6(a).
As we increase the parameter B, a stage is reached where
the saddle has doubled but the stable periodic orbit has not. At
B= 0:555, the saddle period-10 orbit coexists with a stable
period-ﬁve orbit. The manifolds of the saddle point are shown
in Fig. 6(b). We notice a complex structure in which two loops
have formed, but these are joined by branches that connect
with the stable period-5 orbit.
Next, we consider a parameter where both the saddle and
stable mode-locked periodic orbit have doubled. At B=
 0:54, we see a mode locked period-10 orbit and the unsta-
ble manifolds of the period-doubled saddle cycle shows two
disjoint loops (Fig. 6(b)).
Note that this disjoint mode-locked periodic orbit does not
imply bistability, rather the periodic points of the disjoint
loops are cyclically visited. The second iterate of the map
shows a single loop.
The eigenvalues of the saddle and stable periodic points be-
fore the bifurcation are shown in Table I. We note that be-
fore the torus doubling bifurcation, l1is positive, l2is neg-
ative (which subsequently crosses  1), and l3is positive.
Thus, our observation supports the conjecture by Gardini and
Sushko.4

where a;bare the parameters. Fig. 7(a) shows a one-
parameter bifurcation diagram for this system considering a
as the parameter, with bﬁxed at 0.1. A period-1 orbit bifur-
cates to a quasiperiodic orbit at a0:78 as evidenced by the
maximal Lyapunov exponent being zero (Fig. 7(b)). A stable
period-4 orbit emerges at a1:08.
Fig. 8 shows the saddle period-4 orbit with black squares
and the stable period-4 orbit with blue triangles. We observe
that they indeed form a saddle-node connection forming a sin-
gle loop. Thus, the orbit existing for a=1:2 is a mode-locked
period-4 cycle.
We now investigate what happens to this cycle as the pa-
rameter ais varied. A one-parameter bifurcation diagram ob-
tained using a continuation algorithm for both the saddle and
stable cycles, is shown in Fig. 9. It shows that the two or-
bits bifurcate at different parameter values. There is a range,
approximately [1.205, 1.29], where the stable orbit has bifur-
cated but the saddle has not.
Continuation of the eigenvalues of both the saddle and sta-
ble mode-locked periodic orbits as a parameter varies, is pre-
sented in Fig. 10. Fig. 10(a) and (b) show that with increase
of the parameter, at a=1:204, l2reaches 1, which leads to
the period doubling.
When the stable cycle has already doubled but the saddle
one has not (Fig. 11(a)), the unstable manifolds of the saddle
points (red line) form a single closed loop structure connecting
all the points. Branches emerge from the saddle period-4 cycle
(which was earlier the node) to connect the stable period-8
points.
We next consider a parameter value a=1:3,b=0:1, at
which the saddle and stable period-eight orbits coexist. The
period-eight orbit cyclically visits each of its points. Consid-
ering both branches of the unstable manifold, we observe that
the closed invariant curve winds around twice and its length
has doubled, see Fig. 11(b).

V . FROM MODE-LOCKED ORBITS TO CYCLIC
INVARIANT CLOSED CURVES
It is known that when a third frequency is born from a
quasiperiodic orbit, it creates a torus in discrete time. In this
section we present the mechanisms of generation of a third
frequency from a mode-locked periodic orbit. We ﬁnd that it6

TABLE II. The eigenvalues of stable and saddle cycles for a=
1:2;b=0:1, i.e., before the bifurcation
can result in two types of orbits. The resulting orbit can be
a collection of quasiperiodic loops located on a torus in the
discrete-time phase space (schematically shown in Fig. 12),
and the iterates visit them cyclically. The resulting orbit can
also be a mode-locked periodic orbit where the points are con-
nected by cyclic closed invariant curves.
FIG. 12. Multiple loops located on a torus
How can such structures be created? Since the birth of a
third frequency is caused by a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation,
i.e., a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues exiting the unit
circle, the starting point in such a transition has to be a closed
invariant curve created out of a saddle-focus connection. If
a closed invariant curve is composed of a saddle-node con-
nection as shown in Fig. 2, with the change of a parameter a
pair of real eigenvalues have to turn complex conjugate, thus
creating a saddle-focus connection.
The saddle-focus connection can be of two types. The un-
stable manifold of the saddle cycle can either connect with
the one-dimensional stable manifold associated with the real
eigenvalue or with the two-dimensional stable manifold asso-ciated with the complex conjugate eigenvalues of the focus.
It depends on the rate of convergence along the manifolds.
If the 1D manifold associated with the real eigenvalue is the
slow one, the unstable manifold connects with it (Fig. 13(a)).
An example of this situation was presented in [32]. If the 2D
manifold is the slow one, the unstable manifold of the saddle
spirals into the node along this manifold (Fig. 13(c)).
The Neimark-Sacker bifurcation occurring in these two
types of saddle-node connection are shown in Fig. 13. In both
cases, if there are npoints in the stable cycle, ncyclic closed
invariant curves are created.
In the ﬁrst case, the repelling focus creates a loop around
it and the saddle-focus connection through the 1D manifold
remains intact (see Fig. 13(b)). In the second case, the unsta-
ble manifolds of the saddle connect with the closed loops (see
Fig. 13(d)). Note that in bifurcations of saddle-focus loops
also, the saddle and the focus may bifurcate at different pa-
rameter values. Fig. 13 shows situations where the focus has
bifurcated but the saddle has not.
We now give a few examples of the birth of cyclic closed in-
variant curves from saddle-focus connections in physical sys-
tem models.
A. 3D Lotka-Volterra model
In this section, we provide an explicit example of the sit-
uation schematically depicted in Fig. 13(c) and (d) using the
three-dimensional Lotka-V olterra map [5] given by
x0=x+Rx(1 x ay bz);
y0=y+Ry(1 bx y az);
z0=z+Rz(1 ax by z);(4)
where R;a;bare the parameters of the system.
ForR=1;a=1;b= 0:59, we observe a stable period-
six orbit and a saddle period-six orbit. Considering the one-
dimensional unstable manifold of each saddle periodic point,
we observe a saddle-node connection in Fig. 14 (a). As b
is decreased to 0:91, two eigenvalues of the stable periodic
point become complex conjugate, while the third one remains
real, all of which have modulus less than one. The saddle cy-
cle has two complex conjugate eigenvalues with modulus less
than one and a real eigenvalue greater than one. Computa-
tion of the one-dimensional unstable manifolds of each saddle
periodic point reveals formation of a saddle-focus connection
(see Fig. 14(b)).
As the parameter bis further decreased to  1, we observe
that the period-6 stable cycle has undergone a Neimark-Sacker
bifurcation and we can observe six cyclic closed invariant
curves, see Fig. 14(c).
The variation of the eigenvalues of both saddle and stable
periodic point with respect to the parameter bis shown in
Fig. 15. It shows that two eigenvalues of the stable cycle
become complex at b= 0:646. The modulus crosses 1 at
b= 0:968. Subsequently we see the onset of a six cyclic
closed invariant curve.7

colours (magenta, red, black). The other parameters are R=1;a=1.
B. Three-dimensional border collision normal form
Piecewise smooth maps occur in many physical and engi-
neering systems. It has been shown that, in the neighborhood
of a border-crossing ﬁxed point, such systems are aptly rep-
resented by a piecewise linear ‘normal form’ map [33]. For
three-dimensional piecewise smooth systems, the 3D border
collision normal form is given by

the parameter dR(Fig. 17) shows that for dR=1:4, both the
saddle cycle and the stable cycle have two complex conjugate
eigenvalues and a real eigenvalue. At dR=1:455, the com-
plex conjugate eigenvalues cross the unit circle, and a 7-piece
cyclic closed invariant curve is born.

VI. BIRTH OF THREE-FREQUENCY RESONANT TORUS

by the one-dimensional unstable manifolds of a period-10 sad-
dle cycle. When a=27:408, we observe each of the stable
periodic points undergo a supercritical Neimark-Sacker bifur-
cation resulting in the formation of ten-disjoint cyclic closed
loops, see Fig. 19(b).
The system develops two coexisting stable period-20 orbit
fora2(27:461;27:6)(this is not shown to avoid the ﬁgure
becoming messy). At a=27:46, ten disjoint cyclic closed
loops are formed via a saddle-node bifurcation of a pair of
stable and saddle period-20 orbits. Fig. 20 shows the bifur-9
cation diagram in this parameter range. For clarity, we show
the occurrence of saddle-node bifurcation for the cycles lying
on a single loop (two stable period-2 and two saddle period-2
cycles). The concerned loop is shown in Fig. 19(d).
Similar saddle-node bifurcations occur in all 10 loops. At
a=27:5210, there are 10 closed invariant curves formed
through saddle-node connections. These are, in turn, located
on two loops. The iterates toggle between the two bigger
loops and move cyclically among the smaller loops. The re-
sulting phase space is shown in Fig. 19(c). Note that the
saddle and stable periodic orbits form cyclic disjoint loops
connected via their one-dimensional unstable manifold. A
zoomed-in version of one of the cyclic closed loops is shown
in Fig. 19(d).

of closed invariant loops are observed comprising two stable period-
20 orbits and two saddle period-20 orbits at a=27:5210. In (d), a
magniﬁed version of a single closed loop is shown.
VII. COLLISION OF SADDLE-NODE AND
SADDLE-SADDLE CONNECTIONS
It has been reported in [4], that there can be situations where
a stable torus and an unstable torus collide and disappear (see
Fig. 1(d)). If the parameter is varied in the opposite direction,
one can see the birth of a torus out of nothing. Such bifur-
cations, involving ergodic tori have been reported in power
electronic systems.
The question is, can such a bifurcation involve resonant tori,
i.e., mode-locked periodic orbits? In Fig. 21, we schemat-
ically show how such a collision between saddle-node con-
nection G1and saddle-saddle connection G2can take place.
The three eigendirections are shown in different colours and
arrows.

AsG1andG2approach each other as the parameter varies,
they may collide and annihilate each other. If the parameter
varies in the opposite direction, there is a sudden appearance
of two closed invariant curves, one with a saddle-node con-
nection and the other with a saddle-saddle connection. This
is a topologically feasible scenario, but we have not yet found
any physical system that exhibits this phenomenon.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have explored four scenarios related to the
bifurcations of mode-locked periodic orbits and their associ-
ated closed invariant curves:
1. The birth of two disjoint closed invariant curves
2. The doubling of the length of the closed invariant curve
3. The birth of a few pieces of cyclic closed invariant
curves10
4. Merger and disappearance of two closed invariant
curves, one involving a saddle-node connection and the
other involving a saddle-saddle connection.
We have provided prototypical examples of three-
dimensional maps in which bifurcation phenomena 1, 2, and
3 above can be observed. Through numerical simulations, we
have validated the conjectures proposed in [28]. In addition,
we have shown the interesting structures of the invariant man-
ifolds when the node has bifurcated and the saddle has not,
and vice versa.
We have explored the transitions from mode-locked peri-
odic orbits to the formation of cyclic closed invariant curves.
There can be two mechanisms of the creation of an n-piece
closed invariant curve out of a period- nmode locked orbit. We
have presented examples of such bifurcations from a saddle-
focus connection.
The situation depicted in Fig. 21 is mathematically
possible, where two closed invariant curves—one with asaddle-node connection and the other with a saddle-saddle
connection—merge and disappear. We have not yet found
physical examples of such bifurcations, which remains an
open problem.
