ABSTRACT
By applying the holographic method, we study a non-perturba tive renormalization group (RG) ﬂow
triggered by a gluon condensate. After introducing a bulk sc alar ﬁeld in an AdS space related to the
gluon condensate, we investigate the trace anomaly proport ional to the gluon condensate. The holo-
graphic calculation reproduces the one-loop trace anomaly known in the lattice QCD. We also show that
higher loop corrections give rise to additional contributi ons and modify the one-loop trace anomaly.

After the proposal of the AdS/CFT correspondence (or hologr aphy) [ 1–4], there were many attempts
to understand strongly interacting systems by using the hol ographic method. One of the important
features in the holography is that non-perturbative quantu m nature of a quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT)
can be realized by a one-dimensional higher classical gravi ty. In this case, a dual QFT lives at the
boundary of a bulk geometry and the boundary position is rein terpreted as the energy scale observing
the dual QFT. In the holographic studies, therefore, we can i nvestigate the energy scale dependence of
QFT nonpertubvatively by varying the boundary position [ 5–18] or by increasing the system size [ 19–
23]. The energy scale dependence of a QFT is called a renormaliz ation group (RG) ﬂow. In QFT, in
general, it is very hard to ﬁnd a non-perturbative RG ﬂow exac tly because of inﬁnitely many higher loop
corrections. However, the AdS/CFT correspondence may prov ide us a new chance to obtain information
about the non-perturbative RG ﬂow of the dual QFT. In this wor k, we will holographically investigate
the trace anomaly triggered by the gluon condensate in QCD [ 24,25]. This proceeding paper is based
on Ref. [ 26].
When a marginal operator deforms a conformal ﬁeld theory (CF T), the deformed theory still re-
mains conformal at the tree level. This feature can be explai ned by a tree-level β-function [ 27]
βtree=−(d−∆)λ, (1.1)
whereλmeans a coupling constant. For a marginal operator whose con formal dimension is given by
∆ =d, the tree-level β-function automatically vanishes, βtree= 0. This indicates that a deformed theory
is independent of the energy scale due to the scale invarianc e. When we consider quantum corrections,
this is not the case because quantum corrections can provide nontrivial contribution to the β-function.
In the UV region, the modiﬁed β-function is expressed as
β=βtree+βq, (1.2)
whereβqmeans small quantum corrections. At the quantum level, ther efore, a tree-level marginal
operator depending on the sign of βqchanges into one of a marginally relevant, truly marginal an d
marginally irrelevant operators. In this case, a marginall y relevant operator gives rise to a nontrivial RG
ﬂow along which a UV CFT ﬂows into a new IR theory.
It has been well known that QCD is asymptotic free. This means that QCD becomes a CFT at a UV
ﬁxed point. The trace of the stress tensor for a CFT automatic ally vanishes, /angbracketleftTµµ/angbracketright= 0. However, if
QCD has a nonvanishing gluon condensate, it can have a nonvan ishing trace. This is because the gluon
condensate is a marginally relevant operator. In the lattic e QCD, the trace of the stress tensor at the
one-loop level is given by [ 24,25]
/angbracketleftTµ
µ/angbracketright=−Nc
8πβλ
λ2/angbracketleftG/angbracketright, (1.3)
whereλis a ’t Hooft coupling constant. This was known as the trace an omaly triggered by the gluon
condensate [ 24,25,28–30]. In this work, we take into account the holographic dual of t he gluon
condensate and investigate its holographic RG ﬂow holograh ically.
12 Holographic renormalization group ﬂow
The AdS/CFT correspondence has claimed that a strongly inte ractingd-dimensional CFT has a one-to-
one map to a gravity theory in a (d+1)-dimensional AdS space. In this case, a CFT lives at the bound ary
of a bulk AdS space and the boundary position is reinterprete d as the energy scale observing the dual
CFT. For example, a ﬁve-dimensional Euclidean AdS space is g overned by the following action
SAdS=−1
2κ2/integraldisplay
d5X√g(R−2Λ)+1
κ2/integraldisplay
∂Md4x√γ K. (2.1)
Here the last term called the Gibbons-Hawking term is requir ed to obtain a well-deﬁned an equation of
motion. A metric satisfying the equation of motion is given b y an AdS geometry
ds2=R2
z2/parenleftbig
dz2+δijdxidxj/parenrightbig
, (2.2)
whereRis an AdS radius and i, jrun from1to4. This gravity solution is the dual of a four-dimensional
CFT whose β-function automatically vanishes.
In order to investigate a QFT depending on the energy scale no ntrivially, we have to modify the bulk
action by adding appropriate bulk ﬁelds. We take into accoun t the following scalar ﬁeld deformation
S=SAdS+1
2κ2/integraldisplay
d5X√g/parenleftbigg1
2gMN∂Mφ∂Nφ+1
2m2
R2φ2/parenrightbigg
, (2.3)
which is the dual of a deformed CFT by a scalar operator. The gr avitational backreaction of the scalar
ﬁeld modiﬁes the background AdS space, which is reinterpret ed as a nontirival RG ﬂow caused by a
scalar operator on the dual ﬁeld theory side. In the asymptot ic region ( z→0), the scalar ﬁeld allows
the following perturbative expansion
φ(z) =c1z4−∆(1+···)+c2z∆(1+···), (2.4)
with
∆ = 2+√
4+m2, (2.5)
wherec1andc2are two integral constants. On the dual ﬁeld theory side, c1andc2are reinterpreted as
a source (or coupling constant) and vev of a deformation oper ator having the conformal dimension ∆
[2–4]. With the gravitational backreaction of φ, the resulting metric has the following form
ds2=R2
z2/parenleftbig
dz2+f(z)δijdxidxj/parenrightbig
, (2.6)
wheref(z)has to satisfy equations for the scalar ﬁeld and metric simul ataneously.
From the CFT point of view, ∆ = 4 withm2= 0 corresponds to the conformal dimension of a
marginal operator, which does not modify the CFT at the tree l evel. On the contrary, an operator with
20<∆<4is called a relevant operator which deforms a CFT and generat es a new IR theory even at the
tree level. This feature becomes manifest when we consider a β-function. At the tree level, a β-function
is given by [ 27]
βtree≡µ∂λ
∂µ=−(d−∆)λ, (2.7)
whereλandµindicate a coupling constant and energy scale, respectivel y. If we further take into account
quantum corrections, a β-function in the UV region modiﬁes into
βλ=−(d−∆)λ+βq, (2.8)
whereβqmeans small quantum corrections. It is worth to note that thi s decomposition is possible only
in the UV region. In the IR region, a general β-function becomes non-perturbative, so that we cannot
clearly distinguish tree and quantum contributions. Due to this reason, from now on we focus on the
Einstein-scalar gravity in the UV region and compare it with a CFT deformed by the gluon condensate.
In order to realize the general β-function ( 2.8) in the dual gravity theory, we introduce a normal
coordinate z=Re−y/R. Then, the AdS metric is rewritten as
ds2=dy2+e2y/Rδijdxidxj. (2.9)
The normal coordinate is convenient because the scale trans formation of a ﬁeld theory is represented
as the translation in the y-direction. Assuming that the AdS boundary is located at y= ¯y, the energy
scale of the dual CFT is expressed as µ=e¯y/R/R. When an AdS space is deformed by a scalar ﬁeld,
its gravitational backreaction modiﬁes the metric into the following form
ds2=dy2+e2A(y)δijdxidxj, (2.10)
whereA(y)is a function of y. In this case, the energy scale of the dual ﬁeld theory is deﬁn ed as
µ=eA(¯y)/R. Now, we discuss the connection between the bulk ﬁeld and a de formation operator of
the dual ﬁeld theory. The bulk ﬁeld, as mentioned in ( 2.4), allows the perturbative expansion in the
asymptotic region, which corresponds to a UV region on the du al ﬁeld theory side. In this UV region,
a coupling constant and vev of an operator are distinguishab le. However, they are indistinguishable in
the IR region (or in the interior region of the dual geometry) because of mixing of them. Therefore,
it becomes unclear what a coupling constant is at the low ener gy scale. To overcome this issue, we
identify the bulk scalar ﬁeld φ(¯y)at the boundary with a coupling constant λ(µ)relying on the energy
scaleµ. We will show later that this identiﬁcation is consistent wi th identifying c1andc2with a coupling
constant and vev in the UV region.
On the gravity side, in general, the scalar ﬁeld and metric ar e governed by second-order differential
equations
0 = 24˙A2−˙φ2+4Λ+m2
R2φ2, (2.11)
0 = 12¨A+24˙A2+˙φ2+4Λ+m2
R2φ2, (2.12)
0 =¨φ+4˙A˙φ, (2.13)
3where the dot means a derivative with respect to y. In this case, the ﬁrst equation is a constraint and
the others describe dynamics of the metric and scalar ﬁeld. O n the contrary, the RG equation is usually
described by the ﬁrst-order differential equation. To rela te the bulk equations to the RG equation, we
need to rewrite the bulk equations as the ﬁrst-order forms. T o do so, we apply the Hamilton-Jacobi
formulation [ 9–12,14,15]. Let us consider the following general metric
ds2=N2dy2+γij(y)dxidxj, (2.14)
whereNandγµνare a lapse function and induced metric on a hypersurface at a giveny. IfN= 1and
γij(y) =e2A(y)δij, this general metric reduces to the previous one in ( 2.10). Note that, since the lapse
function plays a role of a Lagrange multiplier, we can set N= 1, without loss of generality, after all
cacluation. Using this general metric, the action ( 2.3) can be rewritten as a functional of the extrinsic
curvature [ 9–11]

where the extrinsic curvature is given by
Kij=1

Now, we assume that the bulk geometry has a ﬂat boundary at y= ¯y. Then, the bulk geometry
extends only to −∞< y≤¯yandγij(¯y)becomes an induced metric of the boundary. In this case, sinc e
we assume the ﬂat boundary, the curvature scalar on the bound aryR(4)becomes zero. After introducing
the canonical momenta of φandγij, the above action is rewritten as the ﬁrst-order form

the boundary action

, (2.21)
where∂Mindicates the boundary at y= ¯y. According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, this boundary
actionSBcan be regarded as a generating functional of the dual ﬁeld th eory.
It is worth noting that the above boundary action even for the AdS space with A(¯y) = ¯y/R suffers
from a divergence when ¯y→ ∞ . Recalling that the limit of ¯y→ ∞ corresponds to a UV limit of the
dual ﬁeld theory, the divergence at ¯y→ ∞ is associated with a UV divergence of the dual ﬁeld theory
which must be renormalized by adding an appropriate counter term. Denoting a counterterm as
Sct=−1
2κ2/integraldisplay
d4x√γLct, (2.22)
the renormalized generating functional is given by
Γ[γµν,φ;¯y] =SB−Sct, (2.23)
whereγµνandφare the values at the UV cutoff. In this setup, since the UV cut off is artiﬁcial, the
generating functional must be independent of ¯y
0 =dΓ
d¯y. (2.24)
This is also true at any scale of ¯y. Reinterpreting ¯yas a RG scale, the generating functional independent
of the RG scale leads to the following RG equation
0 =µ∂Γ
∂µ+∂γij
∂logµ∂Γ
∂γij+∂φ
∂logµ∂Γ
∂φ, (2.25)
whereµ=eA(¯y)/Rdenotes the RG scale of the dual ﬁeld theory. Here, we regards the boundary metric
as a coupling constant coupled to the energy-momentum tenso r. This prescription is useful to study the
conformal anomaly of a QFT deﬁned on a curved spacetime [ 31,32].
Using the following relation
dγij
dlogµ=−2γij, (2.26)
the RG equation can be rewritten as the usual form
0 =µ√γ∂Γ
∂µ+γij/angbracketleftTij/angbracketright+βφ/angbracketleftO/angbracketright, (2.27)
5where the β-function and vev of the operator are deﬁned as

∂φ. (2.30)
Before closing this section, there are several remarks. The RG equation in ( 2.27) is the generalization
of the QFT’s RG equation. When the boundary metric is ﬁxed, th e generalized RG equation reproduces
the QFT’s result
0 =µ√γ∂Γ
∂µ+βφ/angbracketleftO/angbracketright. (2.31)
Above, the generating functional in ( 2.23) depends only on the coupling constants. In this case, the ve v
of the deformation operator is determined as a derivative of the generating functional with respect to the
coupling constant, as shown in ( 2.29) and ( 2.30).

whereλ=Ncg2
YMis the ’t Hooft coupling constant and βλmeans the β-function of λ. At the tree level,
sinceGis a marginal operator with ∆ = 4 , the tree-level β-function automatically vanishes. Therefore,
the trace anomaly in ( 3.2) corresponds to the quantum effect. Now, we describe the tra ce anomaly in
the holographic dual gravity which may provide more informa tion about a non-perturbative RG ﬂow. In
order to describe the gluon condensate holographically, we need to introduce a massless scalar ﬁeld, φ
withm2= 0, because it is the dual of a marginal operator with ∆ = 4 according to ( 2.5). In order to
identify the dual operator of φwith the gluon condensate ( O=G), the value of φat the boundary has
to be identiﬁed with the coupling constant φ= 1/(4g2
YM) =Nc/(4λ)in (3.1).
Introducing a superpotential satisfying for convenience [ 12,33–38]
W(φ) = 6˙A. (3.3)

These three ﬁrst-order differential equations are consist ent with the canonical momenta in ( 2.19) and

with
u=Re−y/R, (3.10)
whereyindicates the radial position of the boundary and φ0andφ1are two arbitrary integral constants.
In this case, φ0correspond to the coupling constant at a UV ﬁxed point ( u→0). Here we choose φ1
as a non-negative value, φ1≥0, so thatη=±1means the sign of φ1. Relying on the value of η, a
marginall operator at the tree level changes into a marginal ly relevant or marginally irrelevant one at the
quantum level.
Since the boundary action suffers from a UV divergence, as me ntioned before, we need to renor-
malize it. Adding the following counterterm
Lct=6
R. (3.11)
we easily check that the renormalized boundary action becom es ﬁnite even at the UV ﬁxed point ( y→
∞)
Γ[γµν,φ;¯y] =SB−Sct, (3.12)
7which on the dual ﬁeld theory side is reinterpreted as the ren ormalized generating functional. As a
result, the RG equation of the dual ﬁeld theory is governed by
0 =µ√γ∂Γ

Near the asymptotic region ( u→0), the bulk scalar ﬁeld has the following expansion
φ=φ0−ηφ1
4R4u4+···. (3.17)
This is consistent with ( 2.4) for a marginal operator with ∆ = 4 . Atu= 0,φ0is identiﬁed with the
coupling constant at the UV ﬁxed point. At the tree level, a ma rginal operator gives rise to a vanishing
β-function, βtree= 0 in (2.7). However, the β-function in ( 3.14) can have a nonvanishing value. This
implies that βφin (3.14) is a non-perturbative result involving all quantum correc tions. To see more
details, we ﬁrst take η= 1which leads to a marginally relevant deformation satisfyin gβλ<0in (3.6).
Using the superpotential in ( 3.7), theβ-function and the vev of operators in the UV region allows the
following perturbative expansions

There are several remarks we should note. First, since we con sider a marginal operator, its β-function
must vanish at the tree level. However, βφin (3.18) does not vanish. This indicates that the nonvanishing
βφcomes from quantum (loop) effects. Second, ( 3.19) shows that the vev of the gluon condensate is
proportional to φ1. Therefore, identifying φ1with the gluon condensate in the UV region is consistent
with identifying the boundary value of φwith the coupling constant relying on the RG scale. Lastly, t he
obtained quantities satisfy the following relation
/angbracketleftTµ
µ/angbracketright=−Nc

λ2/angbracketleftG/angbracketright+O/parenleftbig

8This up to a numerical factor is consistent with the one-loop trace anomaly ( 3.2) derived in the lattice
QCD [ 24,25]. The holographic result further shows that the trace anoma ly (3.2) is valid only at the
one-loop level. Higher order quantum corrections provide a dditional contributions to the trace anomaly
and modify the one-loop level trace anomaly, relation betwe en the trace anomaly and gluon condensate.
4 Conclusion
In the present work, we have studied the holographic RG ﬂow tr iggered by the marginal gluon conden-
sate. In the lattice QCD, it was known that the gluon condensa te generates a trace anomaly [ 24,25].
In the UV region, the trace anomaly at the one-loop level is pr oportional to the vev of the gluon con-
densate. In the traditional QFT, it is very difﬁcult to calcu late all higher order quantum effects because
of inﬁnitely many higher loop corrections. In this situatio n, the holographic method may be useful in
understanding non-perturbative feature of QCD. According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the non-
perturbative quantum nature of a QFT can be realized by a clas sical gravity theory.
To study the gluon condensate holographically, we introduc ed a massless scalar ﬁeld in the bulk,
which maps to a marginal operator. In the holographic RG ﬂow p rocedure, the boundary position of a
bulk geometry can be regarded as the energy scale observing t he dual QFT. In this case, the boundary
value of a bulk ﬁeld is reinterpreted as a coupling constant c oupled to the dual operator. In general,
there are many marginal operators in QCD. Here, we identiﬁed a bulk ﬁeld with the coupling constant
of a gauge ﬁeld’s kinetic term to consider the gluon condensa te. Then, we investigated the coupling
constant depending on the energy scale by varying the bounda ry position of the bulk geometry. Using
this holographic RG ﬂow procedure, we reproduced the one-lo op trace anomaly of the lattice QCD. In
addition, we calculated higher order quantum corrections p erturbatively in the UV region. We showed
that higher loop corrections provide additional trace anom aly which modiﬁes the one-loop trace anomaly
known in the lattice QCD.
In this work, we have focused on the holographic RG ﬂow in the U V region in order to compare
the holographic result with the QCD result known in the UV reg ion. It would be also interesting and
important to investigate IR behavior. However, the gravity theory considered here is IR incomplete. To
investigate IR physics, we have to take into account a more ge neral gravity theory having an IR ﬁxed
point. We hope to report some interesting results related to the holographic description of an IR physics
in future works.
