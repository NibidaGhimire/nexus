11 Introduction
The hypermatrix is an extension of the matrix to the higher order ca se (order d≥3).
It has found wide application in many ﬁelds, including computer science [24], signal
processing [ 17], statistics [ 16], etc. We refer to [ 21] for a systematic introduction to
the hypermatrices, and to [ 1,18] for some later developments.
A generalizedmatrix product, called the semi-tensor product (STP ), was proposed
two decades ago [ 2]. Since then it has been rapidly developed both in theoretical
aspects and in variousapplications [ 4,5]. Forexample, it hasbeen applied to the study
of Boolean and ﬁnite-valued networks (see survey papers [ 19,20,22,23]); ﬁnite games
(see survey paper [ 11]); ﬁnite automata (see survey paper [ 25]); dimension-varying
systems [ 7,8], etc.
Later, in addition to the original matrix-matrix STP, the matrix-vec tor STP was
proposed[ 9]andappliedtodimension-varyingdynamic(control)systems[ 8].Recently,
the STP of hypermatrices has also been introduced [ 14]. It seems possible that some
new unknown STPs will appear in the future. In the early days, the ( matrix-matrix)
STP is said to be a generalization of the conventional matrix product . With the
appearance of new STPs, this explanation does not seem to be suﬃc ient.
The purpose of this article is to show that in essence, STPs are repr esentations of
multilinear mappings over hypermatrices. More precisely, the hyper matrices are ﬁrst
expressed in their matrix forms. Then the multilinear mappings over t hem can be
executed by STP over their matrix expressions. For this purpose, the conversion of
diﬀerent matrix expressions of hypermatrices plays an important r ole.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 considers ho w to transform
a hypermatrix into its distinct matrix expressions. The permutation matrix is also
introduced for transforming among diﬀerent matrix expressions. Section 3 shows how
to realize the contracted product of hypermatrices over their ma trix expressions. In
Section 4, the STP is used to perform the contractionproduct of h ypermatrices, which
shows that STPs are essentially multilinear operators over hyperma trices.

2 Matrix Expression of Hypermatrices
2.1 Set-based Hypermatrix
Deﬁnition 1. [21] Forn1,···,nd∈N, a function f:/a\}bracketle{tn1/a\}bracketri}ht×···×/a\}bracketle{t nd/a\}bracketri}ht →Fis called a
hypermatrix (over F), or an order dhypermatrix or a d-hypernatrix. A d-hypermatrix
is also denoted by A= [ai1,···,id].
From a set point of view, a hypermatrix consists of two ingredients:
(i) a set of data
DA:={ai1,···,id|is∈ /a\}bracketle{tns/a\}bracketri}ht, s∈ /a\}bracketle{td/a\}bracketri}ht}; (1)
(ii) an order over DA, which makes DAa totally ordered set. In other words, each
element in DAhas a ﬁxed position, just as in the case of a matrix.
To make the order of DAprecise, we introduce a set of ordered indices, ID, as
follows:
ID(iα1,···,iαd;nα1,···,nad),
which stands for a set of data as in ( 1), where ( α1,···,αd) is a permutation of /a\}bracketle{td/a\}bracketri}ht.
The order of ID is determined as follows: ap1,···,pd≺aq1,···,qdif and only if there is an
s∈ /a\}bracketle{td/a\}bracketri}ht, such that pi=qi,i < sandps< qs.
If (α1,···,αd) = (1,2,···,d), the corresponding ordered set of indices is called a
natural order, denoted by i/a\gbracketleftd/a\gbracketright.
Based on the above argument, a hypermatrix can be deﬁned altern atively as
follows.
Deﬁnition 2. Forn1,···,nd∈N, a hypermatrix (over F), is a set of order ddata
as in (1) with an IDasID(i/a\gbracketleftd/a\gbracketright;n1,···,nd).
To apply classical matrix analysis to hypermatrices, the matrix expr ession of
hypermatrices is a key issue.
Letr= (r1,r2,···,rd) be a set of indices, and
r= (ri1,ri2,···,rip)∪(rj1,rj2,···,rjq) :=r1∪r2 (2)
3be a partition, where r1∩r2=∅, andp+q=d. For ease of notation, we will assume
that the elements in two subsets inherit the element order of the or iginal set, unless
otherwise stated.
Deﬁnition 3. Given a hypermatrix A= [ar1,r2,···,rd]. For each partition
r/a\gbracketleftd/a\gbracketright={ri1,ri2,···,rip}∪{rj1,rj2,···,rjq}:=r1∪r2, (3)
there is a matrix expression of A, denoted by
Mr1×r2
A∈Fs×t, (4)
where
s=p/productdisplay
k=1nik, t=q/productdisplay
ℓ=1njℓ.
Moreover, the elements in Mr1×r2
Aare{ar1,r2,···,rd}, which are arranged by
ID(r1;nri1,nri2,···,nrip)for rows, and by ID(r2;nrj1,nrj2,···,nrjq)for columns.
Remark 1. (i)pis called the contra-variant order of Mr1×r2
Aandqis called the co-
variant order of Mr1×r2
A.
(ii) Ifp= 0, then we set s= 1, and ifq= 0, then we set t= 1.
(iii) Particularly, in ( 3) we require a natural order unless elsewhere is stated. That is,
ri1< ri2<···< rip,
rj1< rj2<···< rjq.
Thus ad-hypermatrix has 2ddiﬀerent matrix expressions with the natural order. The
matrix expressions Mr1×r2
Acan be brieﬂy expressed as Mr1
A, if there is no possible
confusion.

Deﬁnition 4. (i)VA:=M∅
Ais called the (row) vector expression of hypermatrix A.
(ii)MA:=M(1)
Ais called the contra-variant one matrix expression (brieﬂy , matrix-1
expression) of hypermatrix A.
Deﬁnition 5. Letxi∈Fni,i∈ /a\}bracketle{td/a\}bracketri}ht.
(i)
x:=⋉d
i=1xi (5)
is called a hypervector of order d.
(ii) The set of order dhypervectors with corresponding dimensions is denoted by
Fn1⋉···⋉nd.
Note that the components of xcan be expressed as
com(x) :=/braceleftbig
xi1,···,id=xi1
1xi2
2···xid
d|ij∈ /a\}bracketle{tnj/a\}bracketri}ht,j∈ /a\}bracketle{td/a\}bracketri}ht/bracerightbig
,
wherexirris their-th component of xr. Hence it is clear that com(x) (or brieﬂy
hypervector x) is a hypermatrix of order d. Moreover, it is obvious that
Proposition 1.
Fn1⋉···⋉nd⊂Fn1×···×nd(6)
is a subset of hypermatrices.
2.2σ-transpose of Hypermatrices
Deﬁnition 6. [21]
(i) Given a d-hypermatrix A= [aj1,j2,···,jd]∈Fn1×n2×···×nd, and assume σ∈Sd. The
σ-transpose of Ais
Aσ:=/bracketleftbig
ajσ(1)···jσ(d)/bracketrightbig
∈Fnσ(1)×···×nσ(d). (7)
(ii) If a d-hypermatrix A∈Fd/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright
n×···×n, thenAis said to be d-hypercubic.
(iii) Ad-hypercubic A∈Fd/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright
n×···×nis said to be symmetric if ∀σ∈Sd,Aσ=A;Ais
said to be skew-symmetric if ∀σ∈Sd,Aσ= sgn(σ)A.
5It is obvious that a matrix is a 2-hypermatrix, so the above general deﬁnitions
coincide with the corresponding deﬁnitions for matrices.
Proposition 2. A2-hypercubic A∈Fn×nis (skew-)symmetric, if and only if, MAis
(skew-)symmetric.
Proposition 3. LetA∈Fn1×···×ndandr⊂d=/a\}bracketle{td/a\}bracketri}ht. Then

Remark 2. The above arguments stand true even when Fis a set of perfect hyper-
complex numbers (PHNs) [ 12]. In fact, most of arguments throughout this paper also
hold for PHNs.
Next, we recall the permutation matrix [ 10], which is a generalization of swap
matrix.
Deﬁnition 7. Letn=/producttextd
i=1ni,ni≥2,σ∈Sn. A logical matrix Wσ
[n1,n2,···,nd]∈
Ln×n, called a σ-permutation matrix, is constructed as follows:
•Step 1: Deﬁne

δj1nσ(1)δj2nσ(2)···δjdnσ(d)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleji∈ /a\}bracketle{tnσ(i)/a\}bracketri}ht,i= 1,2,···,d/bracerightig
.
•Step 2: Arrange {σ(i)|i∈[1,d]}into an increasing sequence as
1 =σ(i1)< σ(i2)<···< σ(id) =d.
That is,
ij=σ−1(j), j∈[1,d].
Set an index order as
ID := ID/parenleftbig
ji1,ji2,···,jid;nσ(i1),nσ(i2),···,nσ(id)/parenrightbig
= ID/parenleftbig
jσ−1(1),jσ−1(2),···,jσ−1(d);n1,n2,···,nd/parenrightbig
.
•Step 3:
Wσ
[n1,n2,···,nd]:=/bracketleftig
δj1nσ(1)δj2nσ(2)···δjdnσ(d)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglearranged by the order of ID/bracketrightig

Wσ
[2,3,5].
(1)σ1=identity (i.e.,[1,2,3]→[1,2,3]): We have Wσ1=I30.

Since this kind of permutation matrices are of particular importance , some of them
are listed in the Appendix.
Some basic properties of permutation matrices are presented in th e following
proposition, which follows from deﬁnition immediately.

We call this kind of product the onto contracted product. They ar e of particular

This contracted product is called a binary operator on Fn1×···×nd.

4 STP Realization of Contracted Product of
Hypermatrices
This section shows that a fundamental role of STP is to realize the co ntracted product
of hypermatrices. This factor may help us to understand what is th e essential meaning
of STP. For this purpose, the hypermatrices are ﬁrst expressed in their matrix expres-
sions. The STPs are operators on matrices. When the hypermatric es are transformed
into their matrix forms, the action of operators (especially certain contracted prod-
ucts) on their objective hypermatrices can be realized by the actio n of STPs on the
matrix expressions of the corresponding hypermatrices. Figure 1shows this process.
Since there aremanypossible multilinearoperators,including contra ctedproducts,
overdiﬀerenthypermatrices,thecorrespondingoperatorsove rtheirmatrixexpressions
are also diverse. To express these operators, the STPs are also d iverse.
4.1 Classical STPs
From linear algebra one sees that the matrix product has two funda mental types:
(1) Matrix-Matrix Product: It represents the composition of two linear mappings. (2)
Matrix-Vector Product: It realizes a linear mapping over a vector s pace (or between
two vector spaces). Fortunately, when the dimension-matching c ondition is satisﬁed,
the classical matrix product can realize these two functions simulta neously.
When the conventional matrix product is extended to STP, where t he dimension-
matching condition is not satisﬁed, an STP cannot realize these two f unctions
simultaneously. Therefore, we need to distinguish between M-M STP and M-V
products. First, we review the classical STPs [ 8]:
Deﬁnition 12. (i) LetA∈Fm×n,B∈Fp×qandt= lcm(n,p). The matrix-matrix
(M-M) STP of AandBis deﬁned as
A⋉B:=/parenleftbig
A⊗It/n/parenrightbig/parenleftbig
B⊗It/p/parenrightbig
. (39)
13(ii) LetA∈Fm×n,x∈Fpandt= lcm(n,p). The matrix-vector (M-V) STP of Aand
xis deﬁned as
A/vector⋉x:=/parenleftbig
A⊗It/n/parenrightbig/parenleftbig
x⊗1t/p/parenrightbig
. (40)
(iii) Let x∈Fm,y∈Fnandt= lcm(m,n). The vector-vector (V-V) STP of xandyis
deﬁned as
x/vector·y:= (x⊗1t/m)T(y⊗1t/n)∈F, (41)
Deﬁne
M=∞/uniondisplay
m=1∞/uniondisplay
n=1Mm×n,R∞=∞/uniondisplay
n=1Rn.
Then the M-M STP can be considered as the product over M; the M-V STP
can be considered as the action of MonR∞; and the V-V STP can be considered
as an inner product over R∞. It is obvious that they are the generalizations of the
corresponding matrices with matrix-matrix or matrix-vector prod uct, or vectors with
vector product. Furthermore, they satisfy the following genera l properties.
Proposition 14. (i) (Associativity)
(A⋉B)⋉C=A⋉(B⋉C), A,B,C ∈ M.
(A⋉B)/vector⋉x=A/vector⋉(B/vector⋉x), x∈R∞.
(ii) (Distributivity) For A,B,C∈ M,x,y,z∈R∞,
(A+B)⋉C=A⋉C+B⋉C,
C⋉(A+B) =C⋉A+C⋉B;
(A+B)/vector⋉x=A/vector⋉x+B/vector⋉x,
A/vector⋉(x+y) =A/vector⋉x+A/vector⋉y;
(x+y)/vector·z=x/vector·z+y/vector·z,
z/vector·(x+y) =z/vector·x+z/vector·y.
Remark 3. M-V and V-V STPs are not so commonly used as M-M STP. We explain
it a little bit more.
•Topology on R∞:
Consider x∈Rp,y∈Rq, (x,y∈R∞),t= lcm(p,q). Deﬁne
x/vector±y:=/parenleftbig
x⊗1t/p/parenrightbig
±/parenleftbig
y⊗1t/q/parenrightbig
,
thenR∞becomes a (pseudo-) vector space.
Furthermore, we deﬁne
(i) (Inner Product):
/a\}bracketle{tx,y/a\}bracketri}htV:=1
t(x/vector·y).
14(ii) (Norm):
/bardblx/bardblV:=/radicalbig
/a\}bracketle{tx,x/a\}bracketri}htV.
(iii) (Distance):
d(x,y) =/bardblx/vector−y/bardblV.
With this distance R∞becomes a topological space [ 8].
•Linear Dynamic Systems over R∞:
A linear dynamic system over R∞is deﬁned by
x(t+1) =A/vector⋉x(t).
It is a cross-dimensional system [ 13].

Remark 4. (i) Roughly speaking, in classical sense, an STP of matrices is a multilin-
ear operator over hypermatrices. To be precise, when the hyp ermatrices are expressed
into their matrix forms, the STP works as a matrix product.
(ii) Since multilinear mappings over hypermatrices can be v arious, there can also be
various STPs.
(iii) When partial arguments are known, an operator becomes a restricted operator over
the remaining arguments. In this case, STP combined with per mutation matrices
becomes more powerful.

We give two examples for this.

Then

Example 7. [21] In statistical mechanics, the Yang-Baxter equation is giv en as
follows: Let R= [ri1,i2,i3,i4]∈FN×N×N×N. Then we have (in our notation):
/parenleftbig

(3,4)R=R×(1,2)
(3,4)×/parenleftbig
R×4

. (44)
We express ( 44) into matrix form as follows:
Expressing R×4
1Rinto matrix form, we have
MT:=M(1,2,3)×4
RM1×(2,3,4)
R∈FN3×N3, (45)
17where its rows are indexed by ID(i1,i2,i3;N,N,N), which represents the original
(i1,i2,i3)ofR; its columns are indexed by ID(i4,i5,i6;N,N,N), which represents the
original(i2,i3,i4)ofR.
For the product on the LHS of ( 44), we convert MTintoM(i1,i3,i4,i5)×(i2,i6)
T . Deﬁne
σs:/a\}bracketle{t6/a\}bracketri}ht →(1,3,4,5,2,6).
Then we have

Similarly, for the product on the LHS of ( 44), we convert MTinto

5 Conclusion
In this paper, the matrix expression of hypermatrices was ﬁrst pr oposed. As an aux-
iliary tool, the permutation matrices have also been discussed in deta il. It is used to
revealcertain properties of the matrix expression of hypermatr ices.Then it was shown
that the STPs of matrices are essentially the multilinear operators o f hypermatrices
(includinghypervectors).Theoperatorsoverhypermatricesinc ludingcontractedprod-
ucts, arerealizedby STPs through the matrix expressionof hyper matrices.In fact, the
actions of STP over hypermatrices can be considered as a generaliz ation of the actions
of the conventional matrix product over matrices. This fact can b e demonstrated by
Figure2.
