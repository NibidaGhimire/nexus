Biophotons are an ultra -weak emission of photons in the visible energy range from living 
matter.  In this work we study the emission from germinating seeds using an experimental 
technique designed to detect light of extremely small intensity. The emission from lentil 
seeds and sin gle bean  was analyzed during the whole germination process in terms of both 
the differe nt spectral components through low pass filters and the different count distributions 
in the various stages of the germination process. Although the shape of the emission spectrum 
appears to be very similar in the two samples used in our experiment, our an alysis is able to 
highlight the differences present in the two cases.  In this way it was possible to correlate the 
various types of emissions to the degree of development of the seed during germination.  
 
Keywords:  biophotons; complexity; data analysis  1. Introduction  
Nearly an hundred years ago, the Russian biologist A. Gurwitsch, [1,2] doing 
experiments with onion plants by measuring their growth rate, observed that this was 
strongly influenced by the fact that the various seedlings were close or not and that  this 
behavior remained even if any possibility of bio -chemical exchange had been eliminated. 
On this basis he hypothesized the presence of a weak electromagnetic field emitted by the 
plants that somehow is the responsible for the regulation of cell growth . This interesting 
observation was completely forgotten by the scientific community for many years and 
only in the 1950s an electromagnetic emission from living organisms was highlighted 
with the work of Colli and Facchini  [3,4]. Later, in the 80s , F.A. Po pp [5] did an 
extensive work in this field to understand in details the origin and the meaning of such 
ultra-weak emission, hereby called bio -photons.  They are an endogenous production of 
ultra-weak photon emission in and from cells and organisms, and this  emission is 
characteristic of alive organisms. This emission is completely different from the normal 
bioluminescence observed in some simple as well complex organisms, it is at least 1000 
times weaker and it is present in all living organism, from plants to human beings . It is 
also different from the thermal radiation because its intensity is many orders of 
magnitude higher than the one calculated by Planck’s law in the visible energy range at 
room temperature.  The fact that this emission ends when the or ganism dies completely 
excludes the possibility that it is the product of either some radiative decay produced by 
traces of radioactive substances present in the organism or by the passage of cosmic rays.  
The main characteristic of biophotons [5,6] is a total intensity of the order of one 
hundred photons/sec with a practically flat emission within the energy range between 200 
and 800 nm. After any type of stress due, for example, to some chemical agents or  
excitation by light, the emission increases of almost a factor ten and relaxes to the normal 
values quite slowly, following hyperbolic functions rather than an exponential law.  
Despite the wealth of experimental results, the questions of what biophotons are, how 
they are generated and how they are invo lved with life are still open. There are two 
hypotheses about it  [5,6]. The first sees the emission as the random radiative decay of 
some molecules excited by metabolic events while the second hypothesis assigns the 
emission to a coherent electromagnetic f ield generated within and between the cells by 
some biochemical reactions in which, perhaps, oxygen atoms are involved.  
At the same time, there are several experimental evidences that such radiation carries 
important biological information  [7,8] , for examp le, the radiation emitted by growing 
plants or organisms can increase the cell division rate in simil ar organisms by as much as 
30%, the so -called mitogenetic effect [9,10 ,11]. 
Typically our group deals with bio -photon emission from the germination of seed s of 
various kinds.   The experimental set -up to measure the bio photon emission of germina t-
ing seeds is based on photomultiplier techniques and it is constituted by a dark chamber 
and a photomultiplier sensitive to the visible energy range. The detector works as a ph o-
ton counter and the data are recorded as the number of photons detected, within a well-
defined and adjustable time window of measurement, as a function of time. The mea s-
urements are taken during periods varying from few hours to several days, depending on 
the sample. For this reason, t he typical photon -counting data set is a time series  where the 
number of counted photons is reported in the ordinate axis as function of time measured 
starting from a time zero which can be chosen at will, and typically is the moment in 
which the measurement is started after having closed the dark chamber. Details can be 
found in the next section and ref. 12 .   
In a recent work our group proposed the Diffusion Entropy Analysis (DEA) approach 
to analyze the time series produced by the photon counting  of germinating lentils . The 
method of diffusion entropy analysis was introduced in 2001 in ref. [13] and is based on 
the diffusion approach to evaluate the Kolmogorov complexity . The Kolmogorov co m-
plexity is turned into a scaling η, that is expected to depart from the ordinary va lue η = 
0.5. The experimental time series, like the emission we record with our experimental set -
up, is converted into a diffusional trajectory . The complexity of the signal is derived 
through the evaluation of the Shannon entropy associated to the diffusi onal trajectory  
[12,13,14 ]. The main result of ref. 11 is that the biophoton emission shows conditions of 
anomalous diffusion  with a substantial deviation of the scaling coefficient from the ord i-
nary value η = 0.5 . Always in this work it is highlighted as at the beginning of germin a-
tion the condition of anomalous diffusion in realized with the clear presence of crucial 
events . On the other side , when the seeds generate roots the complexity of the biophoton 
signal changes completely its nature  and the departure from the condition o f random di f-
fusion is due to Fractional Brownian Motion  (FBM) [15]. This result yield s an impressive 
similarity with  which found by the authors of Ref.  16, who analyzed the heartbeats of 
patients under the influence of autonom ic neuropathy . In this case the increasing severity 
of this disease has the effect  of moving from a complexity condition generated by crucial 
events to a complexity condition characterized by the FBM infinite memory.   
In the bio -photon emission of germinat ing lentils, the transition from a complexity 
characterized by crucial events to a condition dominated by FBM could indicate the tra n-
sition from a normal physiological condition to one of stress due to the lack of light in the 
experimental chamber but also  the fact that the behavior of plants during the growth pr o-
cess is completely different from that of human beings  [11,12 ]. Plants do not have well -
defined organs, only at the beginning of the germination process there is a differentiation 
process that may require the presence of crucial events. In other words, we cannot rule 
out that the kind of criticality involved by the germination process requires a form of 
phase transition that is not yet known. It has  to be stressed that Mancu so [17 ] and Ma n-
cuso and Viola [18 ] use the concept of swarm intelligence with reference to the non -
hierarchical root network. Thus, it may be beneficial to supplement their observations 
noting that the initial region of germination may have to do with the birth of this surpri s-
ing root intelligence.  
In this work we present a new analysis of the bio -photon emission in terms of both the 
various spectral components and of the photo -counting distribution functions in various 
conditions both for lentil seeds and for the new experimental  data relating to a single 
bean.  
 
2. Experimental data and comparison  
Our experimental set -up is formed by a germination chamber and a photon counting 
system. Seeds are kept in a humid cotton bed put on a Petri plate. The photon counting 
system consists of an  Hamamatsu ( H12386 110) counting head placed on top of the ge r-
mination chamber and an ARDUINO board driven by a PC with Lab -View program. The 
acquisition time window is fixed at 1 second. The germination chamber is built with 
black PVC to avoid any contami nation of the light from outside. The whole system has a 
dark current of about 2 photon/sec at room temperature. Without any seeds or germin a-
tion there is a monotonic decrease of photon emission which arrives in few hours to the value of the electronic noi se. This emission tail comes from the residual luminescence of 
the materials, consequence of the light exposure of the experimental chamber.  
The experiment was done using lentil seeds (76 seeds) and a single bean seed.  The r e-
sults are shown in figure 1. P anel a) shows the emission of the 76 lentils while panel b) 
shows the signal coming from the single bean.  
 
 
 
Figure1 – biophoton emission of the lentil seeds (panel a) and single bean (panel b). 
The black curves are  the counts per second  averaged over 1 minutes.  
 
In both cases the emission is characterized by the initial tail of residual luminosity 
which ends in a few hours and then by a rise which indicates the beginning of germin a-
tion and the subsequent development of the roots and then  of the leaves.  Note how the 
time scale is completely different in the two cases.  
In figure 2 we present the compa rison between the two emissions.  For clarity, only a 
single time scale has been used and the figure shows the emissions in the unit of the 
counts per second averaged over 1 minute. To use a single time scale we chose to align 
the two maximum s of the emission (peak s C), this led to multiply the time scale for the 
single bean by the factor 0.164. The two curves have been moved further to have the  zero 
of the time scale positioned in the first minimum. This means that the value 10 and the 
value 100 respectively for the lentils and for the single bean have been subtracted from 
the original time scale.  
To have the same number of counts in peak s C the values of the counts relating to the 
single bean were  multi plied by a factor 2.28.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 – Comparison between the biophoton emission of the single bean (orange 
curve) with the emission of the 76 seeds of lentil. For clarity, the curve relating to  the 
emission of  lentils has been moved upwards and it has been used the time scale of the 
lentils emission. To get the time scale of the single bean multiply the numbers by the fa c-
tor 6.1 and add 100 hours.  
It is interesting to note that the two types of seeds have a very similar form of emi s-
sion. In the time phase between 0 and 20 the lentil emission presents two peaks (B and C) 
separated by about 5  hours, the same two peaks (B 'and C) are present in the emi ssion of 
the single bean but here they are separated by about  14 hours.  The biophotonics emission 
of the bean shows a further peak (peak A) about 43  hours after the minimum positioned 
at zero in the scale.  This peak is absent in the lentil emission.   It should also be noted that 
in the germination phase, between zero and peak C, the growth phase of the emission 
presents at least two slopes.  
This type of temporal evolution of the light emission seems  to be a general behavior 
of biophotons coming from seeds in the germination phase, emissions of common wheat 
[19] (Triticum aestivum) and of seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana [20] have very similar b e-
havior of what presented here in figures 1 and 2.   
By renormalizing the emissions by the number of seeds, we can find the ratio b e-
tween the number of photons emitted for each single seed  of different type . In this expe r-
iment the ratio between the number of photon emitted by the lentils and the number of 
photon emitted by the single bean is about 133⁄ , number very clo se to the ra tio between 
the averaged weight of single seed  [21].  
 
3. Data analysis  I – Probability distribution functions  
In this paragraph, we report the analysis of the emitted light in terms of the 
probability distribution function 𝑷𝒎(𝑻) of finding m  counts in a given acquisition time 
window T. In a semiclassical picture of the optical detection process the phototube 
converts the continuous cycle -averaged classical intensity 𝑰̅(𝒕) in a series of discrete 
photocounts. Thus the number m of photocount o btained in an integration time T is 
proportional to the intensity of the light that arrives on  the detector  [22].  
A photocount experiment consists of a sufficiently large number of measurements  of 
the number of photocounts  in the same integration period T . The result of the 
measurement is expressed by the function 𝑷𝒎(𝑻) which represents the probability of 
obtaining m counts in the acquisition time T.  The purpose of this measurement is to 
determine, if possible, the statistical properties of light throug h the properties of the 
distribution function , considering that, at least in some particular cases , there is a direct 
correspondence between the functional form of the 𝑷𝒎(𝑻) and the statistical properties  
we are looking for.  
In a real experiment it is practically impossible to repeat the same experiment many 
times, in particular in our case where we have a system that is germinating and which 
therefore changes over time although with much longer times than acquisition time 
window T, which is 𝟏 𝒔𝒆𝒄 in our experiment.  The distribution function is thus 
determined by means of a series of observations of duration T, i.e. we detect the 
number of photons arriving in the phototube in one second and do this for the w hole 
duration of the experiment, typ ically from one hour to the whole time interval of the 
data set.   
The required photocounts distribution function is obtained as an average over 
successive starting time t of the function  
 
𝑃𝑚(𝑡,𝑇)=[𝜉𝐼̅(𝑡,𝑇)𝑇]𝑚
𝑚!exp[−𝜉𝐼̅(𝑡,𝑇)𝑇]  (1) 
 
where 𝜉 is the detector efficiency and 𝐼 ̅(𝑡,𝑇) is the mean intensity of the light field on 
the phototube in the period from 𝑡 to 𝑡+𝑇 [22].  So 𝑃𝑚(𝑇)=〈𝑃𝑚(𝑡,𝑇)〉 and the ave r-
age is done as previously described. On this basis , the mean number of counting is eas i-
ly obtained as 〈𝑚〉=∑𝑚 𝑃𝑚(𝑇) 𝑚  as well the different moments and the variance  of 
the distribution. It has been assumed that the emission is stationary.  In our case this is  
not strictly true but this assumption becomes a good approximation for time intervals of 
the order of an hour or especially after the growth phase at the beginning of germin a-
tion. 
There are only some special cases where the average can be done in an analytical 
form.  The simplest is that of a stable classic light wave where 𝐼̅(𝑡,𝑇)=𝐼̅, i.e. the cycle -
averaged intensity has a fixed value independent on the time [22] . In this case the di s-
tribution 𝑃𝑚(𝑇) has Poissonian form like  
 
𝑃𝑚(𝑇)= 〈𝑚〉𝑚
𝑚!exp(−〈𝑚〉)    (2) 
 
where  〈𝑚〉=𝜉𝐼̅𝑇. A Poisson distribution is a sign of a system in a coherent state which 
corresponds to a classical electromagnetic waves  [22,23] , but, at the same time, this di s-
tribution also occurs for experiments where the integration time 𝑇  is much longer than 
the characteristic time of the intensity fluctuations  of the light beam . For Poisson di s-
tribution the variance is equal to the average 𝜎2=〈𝑚〉, any departure from the Poisson 
distribution is an indication of a non -classical nature of the light and can be measured 
by the Fano factor  [23] 𝐹 defined as 𝜎2=𝐹 〈𝑚〉.  
The photocount s distribution can be also derived for a complete chaotic light [22] and 
it results equal to the photon distribution in a single mode of a thermal source:  
 
𝑃𝑚(𝑇)=〈𝑚〉𝑚
(1+〈𝑚〉)1+𝑚     (3) 
 
and can be applied to any chaotic light  of almost any type [22] . This e xpression can be 
generalized for thermal source with M modes  [23]: 
 
 
𝑃𝑚(𝑇,𝑀)=(𝑚+𝑀−1)!
𝑚!(𝑀−1)!(1+𝑀
〈𝑚〉)−𝑚
(1+〈𝑚〉
𝑀)−𝑀
  (4) 
 
Thermal states are classical and there is the relation  
 
𝜎2=〈𝑚〉+〈𝑚〉2
𝑀      (5) 
 
between the average number of count and the variance. I n general the coefficient 𝑀can 
be very large, this means that the variance becomes almost equal to the average value  and 
we find the same relationship valid for the Poisson distribution . As consequence, for very 
large 𝑀 (greater than 20) [23] the thermal  photocount distribution approaches the Poisson 
distribution.  This implies that it is very difficult to discriminate  between coherent and 
thermal states when many modes are present, in agreement with the discussion of Ref. 
[23]. 
We start our analysis from the counts coming from the dark, i.e. the counts measured 
with the black cap. In other word it is just the noise measured by the Hamamatsu coun t-
ing head. In Fig.3 we report the comparison between the experimental 𝑃𝑚(𝑇) (red square ) 
and two fits usin g equations 2  (blue line) and equation 3  (green line) respectively. The 
experimental average value is 〈𝑚〉=1.56 and the variance is 𝜎2=2.24 [12], the distr i-
bution  turns out to be of super Poissonian type with a Fano factor 𝐹=1.43, slight bigger than one. The t wo fits are almost equivalent in terms of agreement with the experi mental 
data having an almost equal 𝜒2 [24], although they produce a different value of the ave r-
age counts, 〈𝑚〉=0.827 ±0.03 for the Poisson case and 〈𝑚〉=1.16±0.17 for the ot h-
er case. This last  value is much more in agreement with the experimental 〈𝑚〉 and both 
values are consistent with the dark count data of this phototube [25].  
  
 
Figure 3 - Comparison between the experimental counting distribution function (red 
squares) and two fit performed with a Poisson function (blue line) and a single mode 
thermal state distribution function  (green line) .  
We then proceeded with the same type of analysis of the emission in the presence of 
seeds. In the reference [12] the count probability di stribution functions 𝑷𝒎(𝑻) for the 
case of lentils have been derived using 1 hour of emission at different germination time. 
The result of that analysis was to have a slight tendency to super Poisson distributions  in 
all cases, this being typical of chaot ic or partially coherent sources.   
In this paper we present a similar analysis but using different size of the  emission 
period , up to the entire measured data. The analysis relating to the single bean will also 
be presented.  
In Fig.4 we show the comparison  between the experimental 𝑃𝑚(𝑇) for the 76 lentils 
(panel a) and the single bean (panel b) with different type of fits. The measurement time 
period used to obtain the count probability distribution function  is from time 10 (hours) 
and time 83 (hours) to the end for the lentils and the single bean respectively. See Fig.1 
for clarity. In other words, we did not consider in both cases the first period where we 
could have contaminations due to the residual lumin escence, and we waited for the first 
hints of rising in the counts that indicated (especially in the single bean) the beginning of 
the germination process.  The experimental average value of the counts is 〈𝑚〉=23.5 in 
the case of lentils while the single bean  gives a value 〈𝑚〉=7.9, the var iance is equal to 
39.9 and 20.2  for lentils and single bean respectively. In both cases this value is much 
bigger than the average count.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 4 - .Comparison between the experimental count probability distribution fun c-
tion (red squares) of the lentil seeds (panel a) and the single bean (panel b) with three 
type  of fits. The green line refers to a Poisson distribution function, the blue line to the 
multi -mode distribution function and the black line in panel a) to a Gau ssian distribution 
function.  
It is interesting to note how the distribution relative to the single bean is strongly 
asymmetric, and it is impossible to have a good fit of it using both a Poissonian functio n-
al form and a multi -modal thermal type. On the co ntrary , the distribution relative to le n-
tils can be optimally fitted with both a Gaussian function and a multi -modal thermal fun c-
tion. In both cases the fit with a Poisson function is very bad, but this is not surprising 
considering the experimental differ ence between the mean values and variances  and that 
the stationarity hypothesis is only weakly satisfied having considered the entire time i n-
terval of measurement.   
The fact that the distribution of the 76 lentil seeds is strongly symmetrical and can be 
optimally fitted with a Gaussian is a clear indication that the various seeds have different 
germination times which therefore give rise to emissions that are not in phase with each 
other.  
The use of a shorter time period for the calculation of the probability distribution 
function makes the hypothesis of stationarity more easily satisfied. In the case of a single 
bean data,  u sing a shorter emission period for the calculation of the function 𝑃𝑚(𝑇), we 
observe a transition to more symmetrical  distributions. As an example, i n Fig. 5 we report 
the comparison between the experimental count probability distribution function (red 
squares) , relative to the period from 200 (hours) to the end, with two fits using a Poi s-
sonian fit (green line)  and a mu lti-mode thermal  func tion (blue line).   
 
Figure 5 – Comparison between the experimental count probability distribution fun c-
tion (red squares) relative to the single bean emission with two fit using a Poisson fun c-
tion (green line) and a multi -mode thermal function (blue line). Here the emission period 
is between 200 (hours) and the end of the experiment.  
In this case the experimental average counts is 〈𝑚〉=11.33 and the variance is 
𝜎2=12.93, value much closer to the average number of count  than that found in the 
previous case.  The quality of the two fits is totally equivalent producing a practically 
identical 𝜒2 value, in the Poissonian case we obtain a value of the average counts equal to 
〈𝑚〉=11.24±0.05, while the multi -mode thermal function gives 〈𝑚〉=11.3±0.03 
and 𝑀=50.0±0.03.  It is interesting to note that in this last case the eq. 5 is almost 
satisfied.  
We performed this type of analysis for both the single bean and the 76 lentil seeds u s-
ing emission periods ranging from one hour to several hours, up to the total, as shown 
previously..  Some of  this work is summarized in table 1 where the distribution asy m-
 
metry 𝑆 index is reported only for some of the time intervals considered in the analysis . 
The asymmetry index 𝑆 is defined as  
 
𝑆=𝜇3
𝜎3    (6) 
 
where 𝜇3 is the  central moment of order 3  and 𝜎 is the standard deviation. A perfect 
symmetrical  distribution has t he value 𝑆=0.

Table -1 S values for different time intervals for lentils seeds and single bean. The 
time interval are measured in hours. Refer to Fig.1 for details.  
This analysis confirms that t he count probability distribution functions related to the 
lentil seeds are much more symmetrical than those relative to the single bean in almost all 
the different time intervals .  This may be due both to a different characteristic of the 
seeds but also to the fact that in the case of lentils we used 76 seeds to have a good signal 
/ noise ratio.  
When possible, typically for short time window, the distributions can be fitted with e i-
ther a Poissonian or a multi -mode ther mal function, in any cases the experimental var i-
ance is always bigger than mean value 〈𝑚〉, this indicates a super -Poissonian type of b e-
havior that is  typical of either thermal emission or an emission with a very short cohe r-
ence time compared to the time wi ndow of the measurement.  This makes very difficult 
to discriminate  between coherent and thermal states using the photo counting distribution 
analysis, in agreement with the discussion of Ref. [23].  
 
 
4. Data analysis II – the different spectral components.  
 
The use of the a   turnable wheel holding a few long pass glass color  filters makes po s-
sible an analysis in terms of the different spectral components of the emission. The wheel  
with the filters is placed between the germinating seeds and the detector. The wheel has 
eight positions. Six are used for the color  filters, one is empty and the last one is closed 
with a black cap  [12]. 
The transmission coefficients of our filters and the efficiency of t he photo tube as a 
function of the wavelength of light are shown in Fig.6. The transmission coefficients are 
essentially theta functions positioned at the wavelengths written in the figure , thus  only 
light with wavelengths greater than the cutoff value show n in the figure can pass. The 
sensitivity of our phototube allows us to see the emission from near ultra -violet to ye l-
low-orange with good sensitivity.   
 
Figure 6 – Transmission coefficients of the different filters used in our experiment  and 
photo tube efficiency . The wavelengths  of the different cutoffs  are reported in the figure .  
The tot al number of counts at time t without filters can be written  
 
𝑀𝑡𝑜𝑡(𝑡,𝑇)=∫ 𝑚(𝜆,𝑡,𝑇) 𝛼(𝜆) 𝑑𝜆𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝜆𝑚𝑖𝑛    (7) 
 
where 𝑚(𝜆,𝑡,𝑇) is the number of photon em itted from the sample at time t within the 
integration window of size T a t a given wavelength, and 𝛼(𝜆) is the efficiency of the 
phototube. Inserting a filter with a transmission coefficient 𝑓𝑛(𝜆) the number of count 
𝑀𝑛(𝑡,𝑇) becomes  
 
𝑀𝑛(𝑡,𝑇)=∫ 𝑚(𝜆,𝑡,𝑇) 𝑓𝑛(𝜆) 𝛼(𝜆) 𝑑𝜆𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝜆𝑚𝑖𝑛   (8) 
In Fig.7 we report the quantities 𝑀𝑛(𝑡,𝑇) related to the different filters for both the le n-
til seeds and the single bean. The counts without any filters is also show for comparison.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 7 – counts  per second averaged over 1 minutes for the different spectral comp o-
nents. Panel a) is related to the lentil seeds while panel b) refers to the single bean.  
 
It is difficult to follow in details the emission with filters, generally speaking we can 
say that  they almost follow the emission without any filters. To see some possible diffe r-
ent behavior of the various spectral components we can do a kind of monochromatization  
calculating the difference between the counts obtained using two filters with adjacent 
cutoffs , in this way we have almost a monochromatic signal with an energy  resolution of 
the order of 0.1% .  
The number of counts  detected in the wavelength range defined by two filters with a d-
jacent cutoffs is written as  
 
𝑀𝑛,𝑠(𝑡,𝑇)=∫ 𝑚(𝜆,𝑡,𝑇)𝛼(𝜆)[𝑓𝑛(𝜆)−𝑓𝑠(𝜆)]𝑑𝜆𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝜆𝑚𝑖𝑛  (9) 
supposing now that the number of photons emitted from the sample in this wavelength 
window has a slight dependence on the wavelength , the average number of photon  
𝑚̅𝑛,𝑠(𝑡,𝑇)  in a given wavelength interval can easily derived  as   
 
𝑀𝑛,𝑠(𝑡,𝑇)≅𝑚̅𝑛,𝑠(𝑡,𝑇)∙∫ 𝛼(𝜆)[𝑓𝑛(𝜆)−𝑓𝑠(𝜆)]𝑑𝜆= 𝑚̅𝑛,𝑠(𝑡,𝑇)∙𝐼𝑛,𝑠𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝜆𝑚𝑖𝑛 (10) 
 
𝑚̅𝑛,𝑠(𝑡,𝑇)=𝑀𝑛,𝑠(𝑡,𝑇)
𝐼𝑛,𝑠      (11) 
 
The value of the 𝐼𝑛,𝑠 integral can calculate numerically and the average counts can be 
found on the basis of the differences  using Eq.11 .  In Fig.8 we show the ratio between the 
different average counts 𝑚̅𝑛,𝑠(𝑡,𝑇) and t he total signal without filters, for both lentils and 
single bean. As usual panel a) refers to the lentil seeds while panel b) shows the result for 
the single bean. Because of the small counts in the case of single bean , the ratio has been 
smoothed to clarify the behavior as function of time . In the figure the different letters 
indicate the position in time of the main em ission peaks between 0 and the maximum and 
correspond to the same  letters of figure 2 .  
In both cases the different ratios shown changes as a function of time, in other words, 
according to the moment of germination, the total signal is formed by different spectral 
components which change in the relative intensity.  
In the case of lentil seeds, the best signal / noise ratio allows us to say that the dom i-
nant components are those of orange (600 -645 nm) and yellow -green (550 -600 nm), in 
agreement with the results of Colli and Facchini [4].  It is interesting to observe how while 
the high -energy components remain constant for the entire time of the measuremen t, the 
lower -energy parts clearly change in the relative intensity along all the duration of the 
measurement . In particular in the temporal region between 0 and peak B the orange com-
ponent is constant at first and then slight  decreases , this behavior is  associated with a 
simultaneous increase in the yellow -green component of the spectrum .  Here we are in 
the temporal region where germination began  and where DEA analysis tells us that cr u-
cial events are present.  
The emission curve between 0 and peak C is characterized by having two distinct 
slopes, one in the time region between 0 and the first maximum (peak B), another b e-
tween this and the second maximum (peak C).  These two temporal regions have different 
behavio rs of the various spectral components of the emission. We have already described 
the part between 0 and peak B,  in the second region  (B-C) the yellow -green component is 
practically constant while the orange component decreases considerably.  In other words,  
the change in slope is associated with a change in the relative weight of the orange and 
yellow -green spectral components.

wavelength windows are reported in the figure with different colors.  
The behavior in the case of the single bean is not so obvious  because the signal to 
noise ratio is not good in this case . We can certainly say that in this  case the main co m-
ponents are those of orange and blue -green, with the yellow -green component that b e-
comes important in the last phase of germination, where the intensity of emission is at its 
maximum. In any case, it should be noted that this component gr ows throughout the dur a-
tion of the experi ment, while the high -energy component (455 -500 nm) grows consider a-
bly in the region between 0 and peak A and then remains constant in the region between 
this peak and peak B '. This may possibly be associated with th e slope cha nge in the 
growth of biophoton  emission.  
 
 
5. Conclusion and suggestions for future works  
 
In this work we have analyzed in detail the emission of biophotons from lentil seeds 
and from a single bean throughout the germination period. We have highlighted the r e-
markable similarities in the form of emission although the emission associated with the 
bean is characterized by the presence of an extra peak in the time period delimited by the 
0 and the maximum of the emission (peak C) , see Fig. 2  and Fig. 8.  
Data were analyzed both in terms of the probability distribution functions of counts, u s-
ing time windows of different sizes, and in terms of the different spectral components of 
the biophoton emission.   
In the case of probability distribution functions, the procedure and the results obtained 
have been described in detail in paragraph 3. Although this method of analysis has intri n-
sic difficulties in obtaining reliable information on the statistical properties of the emitted 
light, it is clear  how it should be used mainly in cases where the emission from a single 
seed is observed to avoid the problems related to the different times of germination of the 
seeds and which significantly conditions the shape of this distribution as shown in the 
figure  4 (lower panel).  
The analysis of the various spectral components clearly shows how these change 
throughout the germination period.  We have shown how these change their relative 
weight in the total emissions and how this is in some way connec ted with the details of 
the emission, in particular the different slopes observed in the spectra. This behavior 
could be a clear signal that during the germination period the parts of the seed involved in 
the emission process change according to the development of the plant s.   
All this connected must be connected with the information obtainable from the DEA in 
order to build a credible model for this fascinating natural phenomenon.   
It is absolutely essential to increase the signal to noise ratio. This can only be achi eved 
by increasing the solid angle of acceptance of the detector. One possible way is to inte r-
pose F resnel lenses between the sample and the phototube. This method has the a d-
vantage of being very cheap . We are carrying out a series of tests to understand t he gain 
in terms of signal.  
 
 
 
 
Note  - During the preparation period for this work our friend and colleague M. Lucci 
passed away. It is with great pain and sadness that we report this news. This work also 
wants to be a way to honor Massimiliano's work and life.
