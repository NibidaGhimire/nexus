ABSTRACT
Estimating the quality of remote speech communication is a
complex task inﬂuenced by the speaker, transmission channel,
and listener. For example, the degradation of transmission
quality can increase listeners’ cognitive load, which can in-
ﬂuence the overall perceived quality of the conversation. This
paper presents a framework that isolates quality-dependent
changes and controls most outside inﬂuencing factors like
personal preference in a simulated conversational environ-
ment. The performed statistical analysis ﬁnds signiﬁcant rela-
tionships between stimulus quality and the listener’s valence
and personality (agreeableness and openness) and, similarly,
between the perceived task load during the listening task and
the listener’s personality and frustration intolerance. The ma-
chine learning model of the task load prediction improves the
correlation coefﬁcients from 0.48 to 0.76 when listeners’ indi-
viduality is considered. The proposed evaluation framework
and results pave the way for personalized audio quality as-
sessment that includes speakers’ and listeners’ individuality
beyond conventional channel modeling.

1. INTRODUCTION
Task load is a measurement of human performance that
broadly refers to the difﬁculty levels an individual encounters
when executing a task [1]. With the recent shift to hybrid
work, virtual interaction can come with a cognitive cost for
creative idea generation [2]. However, cognitive load predic-
tion is still an unsolved research (and engineering) problem,
although recent audio analysis [3] and video quality assess-
ment [4, 5, 6] ﬁndings are promising.
When investigating the perception of real-time conversa-
tions, such as quality assessments, researchers usually end up
with two options: asking people how they liked it or how
they felt about it after the fact (following, for example, ITU-T

P.800 [7] in case of speech quality assessment). Such sub-
jective listening tests give us an individual rating, but at the
cost of temporal resolution, and it is only an overall score for
the entire trial. Alternatively, we can employ objective in-
trusive or non-intrusive methods pre-trained on thousands of
ratings. Such systems allow us to evaluate a comm link in
real-time, suggesting reasons for audio distortions [8] but at
the cost of individuality. Since those models are trained on
average ratings for many individuals, their output is a mean-
opinion-score that might be true for a grand average but ne-
glects individual differences in users.
We hypothesize that overall quality is factorized by the
speaker (spoken content, speaker’s familiarity), channel (cod-
ing distortions, transmission drops), and listener (personality,
mood). For example, the degradation of transmission qual-
ity can increase listeners’ cognitive load, which can inﬂuence
the overall quality of the conversation. Figure 1 shows a di-
rect inﬂuence of a stimulus’ quality on the listener’s perceived
task load. This relationship was recorded in the user study de-
scribed in 2.1. As the stimuli’ quality drops (level 1 was best
and 4 was worst), listeners perceive a greater mental load thanarXiv:2303.00630v1  [cs.HC]  1 Mar 2023the stimulis’ best quality. More mental resources are needed
to be able to understand the content of the stimuli. Task load
is directly related to quality and other stimuli-dependent mea-
sures of the users’ perception.
In line with other reports, the audio quality – task load
relationship allows us to use knowledge regarding the stim-
uli’s quality to estimate users’ perceived mental load while,
e.g., following a conversation [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In our ex-
ample above, this simple relation explains a good amount of
variance (R2: 0:235). However, we want to investigate if
additional information about the individuals can increase the
amount of variance explained. For example, information on
the users’ personality and frustration (in)tolerance might help
to estimate better someone’s perceived task load.
In this work, we thus explore cognitive task load predic-
tion and claim that its personalization, i.e., incorporating the
listener’s personality, frustration, and emotional levels, can
signiﬁcantly impact its accuracy. We validate our person-
alized task load prediction by solid statistical analysis and
justify further the ﬁndings by machine learning experiments.
Intrusive audio quality assessment methods are perceptually
limited [14], and we thus base our experiments on non-
intrusive speech quality assessment methods.
We hypothesize that knowledge of the listeners’ per-
sonalities improves the prediction of their perception. This
manuscript demonstrates an improvement of a subjectively
perceived dimension throughout a simulated video tele-
phony scenario. The simulation allows us to isolate quality-
dependent changes and control most outside inﬂuencing fac-
tors like personal preference in a real conversational envi-
ronment. We showcase good prediction performance using
the (degraded) audio channel alone as an input and then
gradually improve this prediction by adding more personal-
ity/trait dimensions of the respective listener. While focusing
on perceived task load, we discuss applications to various
dimensions, like perceived quality, valence, or arousal.
2. METHODS
To increase the prediction accuracy of any perception dimen-
sion, we need a theoretical model, a valid approach, a predic-
tion system, and data to test. While we outlined the theoreti-
cal model in the introduction, the following describes how we
obtained data for this experiment, how we tested the concept
statistically, and we describe the machine learning pipeline
that we employ to predict subjectively perceived task load.
2.1. Data collection
We collected data through a controlled lab study at the Tech-
nical University of Berlin, including 46 participants (30
years of median age, 22-57y), ethics board of Faculty IV

FR2022 03). Participants were handed the NEO-FFI ques-

tionnaire [15], a standardized inventory to assess the person-
ality dimensions agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness,
extraversion, and neuroticism. Additionally, we employed
the Frustration Discomfort Scale (FDS) [16] to assess one’s
ability to accept and cope with frustration. Both scales were
used to quantify the participants’ personalities.
In the main task, participants watched a series of short
video clips (10-12s each). The clips show realistic quality
distortions [17]; quality levels were chosen at random. Par-
ticipants watched thirty video clips and answered question-
naires after each trial: Task-load ratings were obtained using
the NASA-TLX questionnaire [18], and valence ratings were
obtained through the affect grid. Participants were compen-
sated for their time with 15 Euros/h. This procedure yielded
thirty task-load scores per participant. However, due to one
person not responding to the personality questionnaires and
several missing values (treated as missing completely at ran-
dom), we obtained 1,279 complete samples from 45 partici-
pants.
2.2. Statistical analysis
The dataset contains TLX score values ranging [0;20], va-
lence ratings ranging [0;1], audio-MOS scores (obtained us-
ing POLQA [19]) ranging [0;4:79], frustration intolerance
score ranging [1;5], and ﬁve personality scores, ranging [1;5].
All values are continuous. A path analysis, a Structural Equa-
tion Model without a measurement model, used to describe
directed dependencies among a set of variables, allows us to
account for possible mediation effects between valence and
the task load.
We ran a path analysis to understand the relationship
between stimulus quality (audio MOS), perceived task load
(TLX score) and valence, and individual characteristics of our
participants (frustration intolerance and all personality dimen-
sions). The analysis was carried out using lavaan [20] with
the Robust Maximum Likelihood estimator in Jamovi/R [21,
22, 23], see Figure 2.2.3. Machine learning-based analysis
The machine learning experiment assesses whether providing
a model with information about each individual would help
predict the task load participants perceived for a certain stim-
ulus. Therefore, we trained models to predict TLX scores
using a raw audio signal and information about the listener as
input. The latter consists of frustration intolerance, personal-
ity measures, and participants’ perceived valence ratings. We
experiment with all permutations of these dimensions to see
which would yield the most explanatory power in predicting
TLX scores.
The model used to perform these experiments is visu-
alized in Figure 3. First, features are extracted from the
raw audio using the Hybrid BYOL-S/CvT model from [24],
which was shown to be effective for a wide range of speech
tasks. We extract utterance-level embeddings, meaning that
the whole raw audio is reduced to a 1D feature vector of
dimension 2048. The Hybrid BYOL-S features and the
chosen individuality dimensions then go through Multilayer
Perceptrons (MLP), each of which has one hidden layer of di-
mension 512 and an output layer of size 128. The ReLU layer
is used as a non-linearity. The two outputs are concatenated
and fed to a ﬁnal MLP that has one hidden layer of dimension
512 and outputs the predicted TLX values.
The data is normalized for these experiments. The model
is trained using the ADAM [25] optimizer, a batch size of 8, a
learning rate = 1e 5, and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
loss. We calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefﬁcient (PCC)
and MAE metrics to assess the model’s performance. We ad-
dress potential overﬁtting by using a 5-fold cross-validation
for evaluation and calculate the mean PCC and MAE values
across all folds.
3. RESULTS
The structural model estimates two variables; valence as a
mediator and TLX as an endogenous variable. For valence,
we modeled frustration intolerance, all ﬁve personality di-
mensions, and the audio MOS as exogenous variables. To
estimate TLX, we used the same exogenous variables as for
valence but also added valence as an additional input variable.
We further speciﬁed several covariances between the exoge-
nous variables to optimize the overall model ﬁt. See Section 5
for full covariance and correlation tables.
The resulting structural model obtained good ﬁt with 2
= 85.049; df = 11; p <0:001; SRMR = 0.054; CFI = 0.977;
RMSEA = 0.073. Given our dataset, these ﬁt indices attest
general validity of the modeled structure. Therefore, it is a
valid tool for investigating our hypothesis. The variance ex-
plained isR2= 0:71for valence and R2= 0:404for TLX.
Table 1 provides resulting parameter estimates.
For valence, three of the seven exogenous variables signif-
icantly inﬂuence the model: the MOS score of each clip has

the strongest inﬂuence with a of 0.839. Regarding the per-
ceived task load, all but two variables contribute signiﬁcantly
to the resulting regression model. The personality dimension
neuroticism only tends to inﬂuence the TLX, while the au-
dio quality does not contribute signiﬁcantly to the TLX. The
mediator valence has the strongest loading of -0.551.
The machine learning-based analysis results are shown in
Table 2. Feeding individuality information into the model as
input helps it to predict perceived TLX signiﬁcantly better
than the audio-only experiment. When only one set of in-
dividuality dimensions is fed to the model, we can see that
FDS values and personality dimensions are comparably good
at improving the model’s results. Meanwhile, adding the va-
lence dimension also shows a signiﬁcant improvement. When
two individuality dimensions are used as input, combining
the FDS and personality scores allows the model to improve
further. Finally, combining all three dimensions allows the
model to achieve its overall best performance.
4. DISCUSSION
The raw audio quality alone determines the perceived valence
of the users to a large degree. Only the personality dimensions
of agreeableness and openness signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the va-
lence ratings further. However, comparing the -loadings ofTable 1 . Parameter estimates of the structural model. Abbre-

the two personality dimensions with the MOS score reveals
a rather small effect of personality on valence. The other
three dimensions and the frustration discomfort score do not
provide statistically meaningful explanations for the valence
dimension. Besides negligible other inﬂuences, valence is
mostly determined through the content’s quality. In compari-
son, a distorted connection decreases the perceived positivity
of the listeners, and good quality yields signiﬁcantly more
positive perceptions among participants.
Regarding TLX, the more valence people perceive, the
lesser the mental load they report. In contrast, a low valence
score is correlated with an increased mental load. MOS score
does not contribute signiﬁcantly to the task load estimation,
although it is the strongest factor in a model without valenceas a mediator. However, most of its explanatory power seems
to be masked by valence. Concluding the statistical analy-
sis, the information about personality and frustration intoler-
ance help explain much variance in the listeners’ responses.
Adding information about someone’s traits provides a much
clearer understanding of their responses and how they felt
during the listening task. During the modeling phase, we also
tested a variant using TLX as a mediator to valence. However,
such a model showed less favorable ﬁt indices, so we settled
with the model described above.
Similar to our statistical analysis, the analysis of our ML-
model approach shows strong gains by adding personality and
frustration intolerance dimensions over only using the audio
ﬁles alone to predict the perceived task load. Both the cor-
relation of the model’s output got stronger, while the average
error shrank. Adding knowledge of the participant’s ratings
of the clips enables us to generate individualized predictions.
In applications, these individualized signal analyses allow for
targeted estimations instead of the same output offered to ev-
eryone if only the input quality is the same.
4.1. Conclusions
We have provided a framework to demonstrate how individ-
uality metrics, here personality and frustration intolerance,
greatly improve signal analyses of perception dimensions.
We conducted a statistical and ML-model-based analysis
and found several signiﬁcant inﬂuences, on the one hand,
increased correlation coefﬁcients (from 0.48 to 0.74) and re-
duced errors (from 0.73 to 0.53 score points) in the prediction
of perceived task load on the other hand. While the dataset
and presented analyses are a good case study to demon-
strate the relevance of subject knowledge, this manuscript
is foremost a motivation towards individualized perception
estimation.
Our analyses are suitable for discussing individuality in
signal processing and perception predictions. However, more
studies must be conducted to substantiate our claim and iden-
tify the areas of strongest inﬂuence. Further investigations
could use crowd-sourced research to obtain a magnitude more
responses than this ﬁrst introduction study has. Because the
present dataset is fairly small, overﬁtting is a potential limita-
tion of this work. However, we will continue investigating the
stated relationships and substantiate our ﬁndings over time.
