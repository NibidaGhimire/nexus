ABSTRACT
Stellar spectra contain a large amount of information about the con ditions in stellar atmo-
spheres. However, extracting this information is challenging and de mands comprehensive numer-
ical modelling. Here, we present stellar spectra synthesized using t he recently developed state-
of-the-art MPS-ATLAS code on a ﬁne grid of stellar fundamental p arameters. These calcu-
lations have been extensively validated against solar and stellar obse rvations and can be used
for various astrophysical applications. The spectra are available a t the Max Planck Digital
Library (MPDL, https://edmond.mpdl.mpg.de/dataset.xhtml?persis tentId=doi:10.17617/3.NJ56TR)
and have been also incorporated into the ExoTiC-LD python packag e (https://github.com/Exo-
TiC/ExoTiC-LD/ which returns stellar limb darkening coeﬃcients used for the software package Ex-
oplanet Timeseries Characterisation (ExoTic).

INTRODUCTION
Libraries of stellar synthetic spectra and their center-to-limb var iations are often needed in the analysis of observed
spectroscopic and photometric data for various applications, e.g. for determining stellar fundamental parameters and
characterizing their orbiting planets. A number of spectral librarie s have been developed, e.g. ATLAS9 ( Kurucz
1993), NextGen ( Hauschildt et al. 1999 ), MARCS ( Gustafsson et al. 2008 ), Phoenix: G¨ ottingen Spectral Library
(Husser et al. 2013 ), and STAGGER ( Magic et al. 2015 ). In this paper, we present a new library of stellar speciﬁc
intensity spectra at diﬀerent disk positions as well asdisk-integrat edﬂux spectra computed with the MPS-ATLAS code
(Witzke et al. 2021 ). We use the same grid of eﬀective temperatures ( Teﬀ), metallicities ( M/H), and surface gravities
(logg) asKostogryz et al. (2022) who recently used MPS-ATLAS to calculate stellar limb darkening coe ﬃcients. This
grid is substantially ﬁner than other published grids especially in metallic ity values.
ATMOSPHERIC MODELS AND STELLAR SPECTRA
We have recently developed the one-dimensional (1D) Merged Para llelized Simpliﬁed ATLAS code (MPS-ATLAS
Witzke et al. 2021 ). It is based on the two codes ATLAS9 ( Kurucz 1993 ) and DFSYNTHE ( Castelli 2005 ;Kurucz
2005) which we have greatly updated. MPS-ATLAS has been intensively te sted against solar and stellar observations
and incorporates improved molecular and atomic data ( Witzke et al. 2021 ;Kostogryz et al. 2022 ). It incorporates the
implementation of the optimized opacity distribution functions (ODF, Cernetic et al. 2019 ;Anusha et al. 2021 ) as well
as MPI parallelization, which allowed us to perform calculations on a ﬁne grid of stellar fundamental parameters.
Kostogryz et al. (2022) presented a new stellar limb darkening library which demonstrates e xcellent agreement
with available solar ( Neckel & Labs 1994 ) and stellar data Maxted(2018,2023). InKostogryz et al. (2022) we only
provide limb darkening coeﬃcients computed for passbands of broa dband photometric missions, such as Kepler, TESS,
CHEOPS,andPLATO1.Inthispaper,weprovidethestellarspectraat24positionsfromt hediskcentertothelimband

disk-integrated spectra (obtained from spectra calculated at diﬀ erent disk positions) together with the corresponding
atmospheric models. The spectra are calculated on 1221 spectral intervals taken from Kurucz(1993). The calculations
are performed on an extensive and ﬁne grid of fundamental stellar parameters. Namely, the temperature grid covers
the rangefrom 3500K to 9000K with a step of100K. We further con siderthe rangeof gravityvalues 3 .0≤logg≤5.0,
which corresponds to stars from dwarfs to sub-giants. The most extensive grid is on stellar metallicity and covers a
range from −5.0 to 1.5 with a step of 0 .05 for−1≤M/H≤0.5, a step of 0 .5 forM/H≤ −2.5, and a step of 0 .1 for
the remaining metallicity values. A detailed description of the grid is give n inKostogryz et al. (2022).
We present two sets of model atmospheres and spectra, ‘set 1’ is based on the chemical element composition by
Grevesse & Sauval (1998) and ‘set 2’ on the composition by Asplund et al. (2009). We used mixing-length parameter
of 1.25 for ‘set 1’ and implemented values from Viani et al. (2018) for ‘set 2’. We allowed a convective overshoot of one
pressure scale height for most of the models. Line blanketing was ta ken into account by using the Opacity Distribution
Function(ODF) approach ( Carbon 1984 ;Cernetic et al. 2019 ). For the ODF computations we considered more than
100 million atomic and molecular transitions from Kurucz(2005). The shape of spectral lines is approximated by the
Voigt proﬁle and broadened using a micro-turbulent velocity of 2 km/ s (seeKurucz 2005 ;Witzke et al. 2021 ). We
include the continuum opacity contributions from both absorptiona nd scattering processes (see details in Witzke et al.
2021;Kostogryz et al. 2022 ).
Both sets of stellar model atmospheres and spectra are publicly av ailable on the MPDL
(https://edmond.mpdl.mpg.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10 .17617/3.NJ56TR). In addition to the atmosphere
structure (i.e. column mass, pressure and temperature) the mod els contain important input parameters, such as
stellar parameters, overshoot, mixing-length parameter, and ab undances of all chemical elements. We also include
the convergence criteria, which are given by the maximum temperat ure change over all depth points between the two
last iterations of the atmospheric structure calculations. For the subsequently computed spectra, we use the same
settings, namely the same ODF, continuum opacity, equation-of-s tate and abundances, as were used for computing
the atmospheric models.
INTEGRATION INTO EXOTIC-LD
ExoTiC-LD ( Grant & Wakeford 2022 ) is a package developed from ExoTiC-ISM ( Laginja & Wakeford 2020a ,b). It
produces stellar limb-darkening coeﬃcients for speciﬁc instrument s, stars, and wavelength ranges based on ATLAS9
(Claret 2000 ) and STAGGER ( Magic et al. 2015 ) libraries. We have incorporated our library (both ‘set 1’ and ‘set 2’)
into ExoTiC-LDallowing users to obtain limb darkening coeﬃcients with r educed errorsfor many stars (due to the ﬁne
grid of fundamental parameters we used and high accuracy of our calculations, see Witzke et al. 2021 ;Kostogryz et al.
2022;Maxted 2023 ). Recently, Maxted (2023) obtained stellar limb darkening coeﬃcients from Keplerand TESS
observations and compared them to the coeﬃcients computed with diﬀerent existing spectra libraries. He found
that MPS-ATLAS ‘set 1’ leads to a better agreement with the obser ved stellar limb darkening curves. Therefore, in
ExoTiC-LD v3.0.0 ( Grant & Wakeford 2022 ) we set the MPS-ATLAS ‘set 1’ to be the default limb darkening library .
