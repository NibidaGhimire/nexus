ABSTRACT
We report initial results from an ongoing spectroscopic survey of central stars of faint planetary nebulae (PNe), obtained with
the Low-Resolution Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The six PN nuclei (PNNi) discussed here all have strong

lines, we estimate them to have eÔ¨Äective temperatures of order 170,000 K. The central star of Kn 15 has a Wolf-Rayet-like
spectrum, with strong and broad emission lines of He /i.pc/i.pc, C/i.pc/v.pc, N/v.pc, and O /v.pc-/v.pc/i.pc. We classify it [WO2], but we note that the N /v.pc

these stars would be of interest, given the large fraction of pulsating variables seen among PG1159 and [WO] PNNi.

1 INTRODUCTION: NUCLEI OF PLANETARY NEBULAE
Planetarynebulae(PNe)markthetransitionofanasymptotic-giant-
branch (AGB) star across the HR diagram to the onset of the white-
dwarf (WD) cooling sequence. At the end of the AGB stage, the
outer layers of the star (initial masses in the range 0.8‚Äì8ùëÄ) are
ejected, and the remnant core rapidly evolves to higher temperature.
When the star reaches an eÔ¨Äective temperature of 30,000 K, its
ultraviolet (UV) radiation ionizes the surrounding ejecta, producing
the PN‚Äîwhich lasts a few times 104yr before dissipating. For a
recent review of PNe, see Kwitter & Henry (2022). The central
stars of PNe‚Äîplanetary-nebula nuclei (PNNi)‚Äîshow a remarkable
range of spectroscopic and photometric phenomena. These include
the eÔ¨Äects of binary companions, unusual chemical compositions,
pulsations, and stellar winds.
In recent years, deep-sky surveys have revealed numerous new
low-surface-brightnessPNe.AnexampleisthevisualsearchofDig-
itized Sky Survey (DSS) images by the ‚ÄúDeep-Sky Hunters‚Äù (DSH)

ters, but as a byproduct discovered about two dozen PN candidates

about 100 new candidate PNe; see Jacoby et al. (2010), where the
search techniques are described. Six years later, the number of PN
candidates from the DSH survey had grown to more than 250 (Kro-
nberger et al. 2016). Meantime, a large group of amateurs, located
primarily in France, has discovered more than 200 new PNe, plus
hundredsoffurthercandidates(LeD√ªetal.2022),usingavarietyof
techniques including long-exposure CCD and CMOS imaging with
small telescopes. A website1maintained by P. Le D√ª and T. Petit

ManyofthenewlydiscoveredPNehavefaint,andoftenblue,stars
near their centres, but relatively little is known about these candi-
date PNNi. In response to these discoveries, in 2019 H.E.B. began
a spectroscopic survey of these potentially new central stars. The
surveyismodeledontheearlyworkofNapiwotzki&Schoenberner
(1995),whoobtainedandclassiÔ¨Åedspectraof 3dozenfaintPNNi.
In a subsequent followup, about 200 spectral types for PNNi were
assembled from the literature by Napiwotzki (1999). More recently,

The aim of the present survey is to obtain spectra of modest res-
olution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), for the purposes of spectral
classiÔ¨Åcation, and to identify objects worthy of followup at higher
resolutionformoredetailedanalysis.InthisÔ¨Årstpaperfromthesur-

central stars with strong emission lines of O /v.pc/i.pc, described in detail

dozen additional objects.
2 OBSERVATIONS
Spectroscopic observations for the survey are obtained with the
second-generation Low-Resolution Spectrograph (LRS2) of the 10-
m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET; Ramsey et al. 1998; Hill et al.
2021), located at McDonald Observatory in west Texas, USA. The
LRS2instrumentisdescribedindetailbyChonisetal.(2014,2016),
but we give an overview here.
LRS2 provides integral-Ô¨Åeld-unit (IFU) spectroscopy with 280
0¬ï006-diameter lenslets that cover a 1200600Ô¨Åeld of view (FOV)
on the sky. LRS2 is composed of two arms: blue (LRS2-B) and red
(LRS2-R).Allofourobservationsaremadewiththetargetplacedin
theLRS2-BFOV.TheLRS2-Barmemploysadichroicbeamsplitter
to send light simultaneously into two spectrograph units: the ‚ÄúUV‚Äù
channel (covering 3640‚Äì4645 √Ö at resolving power 1910), and the
‚ÄúOrange‚Äùchannel(covering4635‚Äì6950√Öatresolvingpower1140).
HET observations are carried out in a queue-scheduling mode
(see Shetrone et al. 2007). We submitted a lengthy list of candidate
targets, selected primarily from the sources described in ¬ß1. Our
PNNi survey belongs to the lowest priority level (P4) in the queue,
meaning that data are obtained when schedule gaps and/or marginal
weather or seeing conditions preclude higher-priority observations.
Thus the observed targets are eÔ¨Äectively chosen at random from the
input list. We generally obtain several observations of each target,
allowing the data for each object to be combined, increasing the
SNR of the Ô¨Ånal spectrum. Moreover, multiple observations allow
us to search for spectral changes, such as those due to stellar-wind
variations,binarycompanions,orspectacularmass-losseventssuch
as those seen in the central star of Lo 4 (Bond 2014).
3 DATA REDUCTION
Raw LRS2 data are processed with Panacea3, an automated reduc-
tionpipelinewrittenbyG.R.Z.(Zeimannetal.,inpreparation).Initial
processingincludesbiasandÔ¨Çat-Ô¨Åeldcorrectionandwavelengthcal-
ibration. Panacea uses a spatial and spectral point-spread-function
Ô¨Ålter to identify the highest-SNR object separately in each channel
(UV and Orange). In this paper we discuss the spectra of six cen-
tral stars, described in detail below. For four of the six targets, the
brightest object in the Ô¨Åeld was our desired central star; however,
for the objects Kn 12 and Kn 15 there was a neighboring and cooler
companionthattheautomaticpipelineselectedinsteadintheOrange
channel. Wediscuss those cases inthe next paragraph. Forthe other
objects,afterthetargetisidentiÔ¨Åed,skyÔ¨Åbersareselectedtobe ¬°300

Flux calibration is based on default response curves generated from
standard stars observed over many nights, measures of the mirror
illumination, and the exposure throughput from guider images.
As noted, Kn 12 and Kn 15 posed special problems because of
nearby Ô¨Åeld stars falling within the LRS2-B FOV. After the initial
reduction, we used LRS2Multi4, apythoninterface, to perform
advancedreductionstepsandcalibrationsfor Panacea products.We
manually identiÔ¨Åed the target PNN in each exposure, and deÔ¨Åned
extractionapertureswithradiiof 2¬ï005and1¬ï005forKn12andKn15,

This was done in order to subtract the nebular emission consistently
fromallofthetargetspectra.FortheÔ¨Ånalspectraofallofthetargets,
we masked the strongest PN emission lines, as well as the night-sky
emission lines at 5577 √Ö and 6300 √Ö. We used a 6 √Ö window and
6 √Ö Gaussian kernel to interpolate over the masked regions.
4 ‚ÄúO /v.pc/i.pc‚Äù PLANETARY NUCLEI
The majority of PNNi have hydrogen-rich atmospheres, but about
one-third are hydrogen-deÔ¨Åcient (see, for example, the Weidmann
et al. 2020 catalogue). Among hydrogen-poor central stars, a small

(e.g., Smith & Aller 1969; Aller 1975; Heap 1975, 1982; Kaler &
Shaw 1984). Kaler et al. (1991) recognized two subtypes of O /v.pc/i.pc
central stars: those in which the O /v.pc/i.pcdoublet is well resolved, and
those in which the O /v.pc/i.pcemission comes from a stellar wind having
such a high velocity that the doublet is blended into a single strong,
broad feature at3820 √Ö.
Hydrogen-deÔ¨Åcient PNNi are generally considered to belong to
an evolutionary sequence of evolved post-AGB stars that have expe-
rienced a late or very late thermal pulse. The re-ignition of helium
shell burning returns the star to an earlier stage of low temperature
and large radius‚Äîa ‚Äúborn-again‚Äù red giant‚Äîand in the process the
surfacehydrogenisburned.TheH-deÔ¨Åcientstarthenretracesitspre-
vious post-AGB evolution, proceeding Ô¨Årst to higher temperatures,
andeventuallybeginningitsdescentoftheWDcoolingsequence.As
the star evolves, an initially dense stellar wind gradually diminishes
and fades away. See M√©ndez et al. (1986), Werner et al. (2003a),
Werner & Herwig (2006), L√∂bling et al. (2019), Weidmann et al.
(2020), and references therein, for discussions of such evolutionary
scenarios.
Post-thermal-pulse central stars with dense, hydrogen-deÔ¨Åcient
stellar winds have spectra that resemble those of massive carbon-
typeWolf-Rayet(WR)stars.Inmodernspectral-classiÔ¨Åcationtermi-
nology, such PNNi are assigned to spectral type [WC], the brackets
distinguishing them from massive WR stars. These stars can have
spectral types as late as [WC11] or [WC12] (e.g., Margon et al.
2020). Their subsequent evolution takes them through earlier [WC]
types, to extremely hot [WO] stars (an alternative terminology for
O/v.pc/i.pcnuclei),andthencetothe‚ÄúPG1159‚ÄùhotWDs.See,forexample,
Figure1inWerner&Herwig(2006)andFigure2inWeidmannetal.

quence of spectral types. The PG 1159 WDs are, in turn, the likely
progenitors of the cooling sequence of hydrogen-deÔ¨Åcient DO, DB,
and DQ WDs (e.g., B√©dard et al. 2022, and references therein).
The spectra of PG 1159 WDs are characterized by a distinctive
blend of He /i.pc/i.pcand C /i.pc/v.pcfeatures in an absorption ‚Äútrough‚Äù at 4650‚Äì

5 FIVE PG 1159 CENTRAL STARS
At this writing, we have obtained LRS2-B survey spectra for about
four dozen faint PNNi. The present paper focuses on the six of
them that have strong O /v.pc/i.pcemission. To our knowledge, they have
not been recognized previously as O /v.pc/i.pcPNNi (although one was
already known to belong to the PG 1159 class). Table 1 lists these
objectsandtheirPNGdesignations,alongwithcelestialandGalactic

Table 1, and are discussed below. Details of our LRS2-B exposures
are presented in Table 2.
In one of the targets, Kn 15, the O /v.pc/i.pcdoublet is extraordinarily
strong and blended; this remarkable object is described in the next
section. In the spectra of the other Ô¨Åve objects, the O /v.pc/i.pcemission

All Ô¨Åve spectra in Figure 2 are remarkably similar.8In addition
to the O /v.pc/i.pcdoublet, all Ô¨Åve stars have strong emission at C /i.pc/v.pc5801‚Äì

and 4945 √Ö. Several of the spectra have an emission line at 4340 √Ö,
and all Ô¨Åve have one at 6068 √Ö; these features were identiÔ¨Åed with
Ne/v.pc/i.pc/i.pc/i.pcin a sample of PG 1159 stars by Werner et al. (2007).9All
Ô¨Åve spectra have interstellar absorption at Ca /i.pc/i.pc3933‚Äì3968 √Ö and

Numerous absorption lines are seen in the spectra. These are due
to He /i.pc/i.pc, C/i.pc/v.pc, and O /v.pc/i.pc, and are typical of the features seen in stars
of the PG 1159 class. The 4650‚Äì4690 √Ö absorption feature in all

In the next Ô¨Åve subsections we give details of each target and its
surrounding PN. Our highest-SNR spectrum is that of the brightest
target, Abell 72. In ¬ß5.6 we compare it with a model-atmosphere
synthetic spectrum, in order to make approximate estimates of its
parametersandcomposition.GiventhesimilaritiesoftheÔ¨Åvespectra,
these parameters should roughly apply to all of the objects.

This faint PN was discovered by amateur N. Outters during deep
CCD imaging of a neighboring Galactic H /i.pc/i.pcregion, as reported by
Ackeretal.(2012).Thenebulaisroughlyspherical,withadiameter
of about 8000. DSS images show a faint ( ùê∫=19¬ï27) blue star lying
at the center, and our HET spectra are of this object. The star was
also noted as a candidate WD or PNN during searches of Gaia
data by Gentile Fusillo et al. (2019) and Chornay & Walton (2020),
and was identiÔ¨Åed as the central star more recently by Ritter et al.
(2022). Nebular spectra obtained by Acker et al. (2012) and Ritter
et al. (2022) show strong He /i.pc/i.pc4686 √Ö emission, implying a high
temperature for the central star.

8The apparent broad emission feature at 4660 √Ö in Kn 12 is probably
spurious; see ¬ß5.3.

spectrum.DeMarcoetal.(2015)wereunabletoprovideadeÔ¨Ånitive
explanation for the remarkable photometric behavior. They did note
that a WD with similar eruptive behavior exists: WD J1916+3938
(Hermes et al. 2011; Bell et al. 2015). Moreover, Bell et al. (2016)
found two more outbursting WDs in their examination of WDs in
theKeplerÔ¨Åeld,andyetanothercasewasfoundduringtheextended
Keplermission by Hermes et al. (2015). But all of these erupting
WDs are hydrogen-rich DA stars, having eÔ¨Äective temperatures of
11,000 K, much cooler than the central star of Kn 61; thus the
phenomena may be unrelated.
5.3 Kn 12
Kn 12 was classiÔ¨Åed as a possible PN in an early publication by the
DSH team (Kronberger et al. 2006). A deep H ùõºimage is given by
Jacoby et al. (2010), showing a clumpy nebula with dimensions of
about 54004700; these authors called Kn 12 a probable PN. Our
inspection of DSS images showed a conspicuous blue star near the
center,whichwasalsonotedasacandidateWDorhotsubluminous

to show a broad emission feature at 4660 √Ö, in the vicinity of
several lines of C /i.pc/v.pc. This feature is likely spurious, as it lies at the
junction of the UV and Orange channels; at this location, the LRS2

transmission function of the dichroic beamsplitter is temperature-
sensitive. Only two out of our three visits to Kn 12 showed this
apparent emission feature.5.4 Abell 72

servatory Sky Survey (POSS) for faint nebulae by Abell (1966),

Ball Nebula Kn 61 is noted in the HASH catalogue. There are nu-
merous studies of the nebula in the literature, but to our knowledge
the only published spectroscopic study of the central star is by De
Marco et al. (2013), who simply state that an ‚ÄúUltraviolet Visual
Echelle Spectrograph spectrum suggests a temperature in excess of
120,000 K.‚Äù

5.6 Atmospheric Parameters and Compositions
In this subsection, we make an exploratory exploration of the atmo-
spheric parameters and chemical compositions for these Ô¨Åve stars,
which, as noted above, all have very similar spectra.
The presence of emission lines from the 3s‚Äì3p doublets of C /i.pc/v.pc,
N/v.pc,andO /v.pc/i.pcat5801‚Äì5012,4604‚Äì4620,and3811‚Äì3834√Ö,respec-
tively,inourÔ¨ÅvePG1159centralstarsimplieseÔ¨Äectivetemperatures
well in excess of 100,000 K. As a typical example, in Figure 3 we
compare the spectrum of Abell 72 with that of a non-LTE model-
atmosphere synthetic spectrum having ùëáeÔ¨Ä=150¬ñ000K. Note that
the model includes no stellar wind; the emission doublets of C /i.pc/v.pc,
N/v.pc, and O /v.pc/i.pcarise in the photosphere. The model is taken from
the grid introduced by Werner et al. (2014), in which the T√ºbin-
gen Model-Atmosphere Package (TMAP; Werner et al. 2003b) was
usedtocomputenon-LTEplane-parallelmodelsinradiativeandhy-
drostatic equilibrium. The compositions of the model atmospheres
include He, C, N, and O. They do not include Ne, although it is
detected in all Ô¨Åve stars. The wings of the He /i.pc/i.pcabsorption lines
in our Ô¨Åve targets indicate that their surface gravities are of order
logùëî'6¬ï5.
As noted in the Figure 3 caption, the atmosphere of Abell 72 is
found to be composed almost entirely of helium and carbon. The
oxygen abundance is diÔ¨Écult to estimate from the current spectra;
however, it could be as low as 1% by mass, because otherwise
we would see broad and shallow absorption wings accompanying
the O /v.pc/i.pcemission line at 5290 √Ö (Werner et al. 1991). The oxygen
abundance in PG 1159 stars isoften found to be signiÔ¨Åcantly higher
(of the order 10%) than it is in Abell 72 (and the other four stars);
however,similarlylowabundanceshavebeenfoundinafewobjects
inpreviousstudies(e.g.,Werner&Rauch2014;L√∂blingetal.2019).
As usual in a number of PG 1159 stars, the presence of N /v.pclines
pointstoanitrogenabundanceoftheorderof1%bymass(Werner&
Herwig 2006). Although not included in the model, the same likely
holds for neon, for which we identify a number of Ne /v.pc/i.pc/i.pclines in
Abell 72 and the other central stars. The Ne /v.pc/i.pc/i.pc/i.pcemission lines at
4340 and 6068 √Ö indicate that this star, and the other four, have
eÔ¨Äective temperatures even higher than that of the model, perhaps
close to 170,000 K (Werner et al. 2007).

6 THE [WO2] NUCLEUS OF Kn 15
6.1 Spectrum
Kn15wasnotedasapossiblePNinavisualsurveyofPOSSplatesby
Romanetal.(2000).TheDSHteam(Kronbergeretal.2006)likewise
catalogued it as a candidate PN, as did Viironen et al. (2009) in a
search of the INT Photometric H-alpha Survey (IPHAS) catalogue.
Jacoby et al. (2010) considered it a probable PN, presenting an H ùõº
image, and giving dimensions of 30002300. The central star is a
conspicuous 17th-magnitude blue star.
Figure 4 plots our mean spectrum of the nucleus of Kn 15. This
is an equally weighted combination of our eight exposures obtained
overfourepochs,normalizedtoaÔ¨Çatcontinuum,with3-pointboxcar
smoothing. The spectrum shows an extremely strong and blended
O/v.pc/i.pc3811‚Äì3834 √Ö doublet, as well as prominent emission features
of He /i.pc/i.pcand C /i.pc/v.pc. O/v.pc5590 √Ö emission is strong, as is N /v.pc4604‚Äì
4620 √Ö. Weaker emission due to Ne /v.pc/i.pc/i.pc-/v.pc/i.pc/i.pc/i.pcis also present.
This spectrum is similar to that of the star Sanduleak 3 (Sand 3),
whose very strong O /v.pc/i.pcemission was discovered Ô¨Åve decades ago
on an objective-prism plate by Sanduleak (1971). Until recently,
Sand 3 was not known to be surrounded by an optically detectable
PN.However,Gvaramadzeetal.(2020)pointedoutthatmid-infrared
images from the Wide-Ô¨Åeld Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) show
a bright clumpy nebula with a diameter of 10, surrounded by a
much fainter circular halo with a diameter of 60. These authors also
detected several hydrogen-deÔ¨Åcient optical knots lying within the
clumpymid-IRnebula.The22 ùúámWISEimageofKn15(available
at the HASH website) shows that it is likewise surrounded by a
conspicuous mid-IR nebula, with hints of a faint circular outer halo
similartothatofSand3.Itwouldbeofinteresttodeterminewhether
therearehydrogen-deÔ¨ÅcientknotswithintheKn15PN,inadditiontotheÔ¨ÅlamentaryH ùõºstructuresseenintheimagepresentedbyJacoby
et al. (2010).
Optical and UV spectroscopy of Sand 3 was discussed by Barlow
et al. (1980) and Barlow & Hummer (1982). Although its spectrum
superÔ¨Åcially resembles that of a massive WO-type Wolf-Rayet star,
Sand3liesataGalacticlatitudeof ¬∏12;Barlow&Hummer(1982)

abundances in [WO] and [WC] central stars‚Äîsimilar to what is
observed in PG 1159 stars (see Werner & Herwig 2006).
6.2 Spectral Variability
To investigate whether the spectrum of Kn 15 varies with time, we
intercompared our individual observations, obtained at four widely
separated epochs between 2019 and 2022 (see Table 2). We Ô¨Ånd
evidencethatthespectrumdoesvary.InFigure5weplotthespectra

widths of the C /i.pc/v.pc5801‚Äì5811 √Ö blend and O /v.pc5590 √Ö, by factors
of1.5 and 1.4, respectively. However, the O /v.pc/i.pc5290 √Ö line is
essentially non-variable. This is also true of the strong O /v.pc/i.pc3811‚Äì
3834 √Ö doublet in the UV channel (not plotted). By examining the
spectra in absolute Ô¨Çux units, we veriÔ¨Åed that it is the emission
linesthatarevarying;thecontinuumlevelschangebymuchsmaller
amounts, if at all.
Variations in emission-line proÔ¨Åles in PNNihave been noted pre-
viously(e.g.,Balicketal.1996;Grosdidieretal.2000,2001).How-
ever, these have generally been seen in late-type [WC] PNNi, such
as the central star of NGC 40, and they have amplitudes of only a
fewpercent.Barlowetal.(1980)reportedevidencefortimevariabil-
ity of line proÔ¨Åles in their spectra of Sand 3, but the changes were
likewise considerably more subtle than those we see in Kn 15. To
our knowledge, emission-line equivalent-width changes by a factor
of1.5 have not been seen previously in a PNN, with the exception
of the unique spectroscopic outbursts of the O /v.pc/i.pc/PG 1159 nucleusofLo4(Bond2014).Theyareindicativeofvariationsorclumpiness
in the stellar-wind outÔ¨Çow.
Our only constraint on the rapidity of the variations in Kn 15
comes from the two individual exposures that we obtained on four
nights. These were typically spaced 6 minutes apart; none of them
showed signiÔ¨Åcant variations over that brief time span.

We present initial results from an ongoing spectroscopic survey of
centralstarsoffaintPNe.Thesixstarsdiscussedhereallshowstrong

tral class, exhibiting strong absorption lines of He /i.pc/i.pcand C /i.pc/v.pc. In an
exploratory examination of the data, we compare Abell 72 with a
synthetic model-atmosphere spectrum. We conclude that its eÔ¨Äec-
tive temperature (and by inference that of our other four PG1159
stars) is of order 170,000 K, as indicated by the presence of Ne /v.pc/i.pc/i.pc/i.pc

for our four epochs of HET/LRS2 observations. As in Figure 4 the spectra
are normalized to a Ô¨Çat continuum, and 3-point smoothing has been applied.
Some of the emission lines, including C /i.pc/v.pc5801‚Äì5811 √Ö and O /v.pc5590 √Ö,
vary in equivalent width by factors of as much as 1.5, but others are nearly

amounts of helium and carbon, with small amounts ( 0.5‚Äì1%) of
nitrogen, oxygen, and neon.
The sixth star, the nucleus of Kn 15, has a spectrum resembling
those of massive Wolf-Rayet stars, with strong and broad emission
at the O /v.pc/i.pcdoublet, as well as conspicuous emission due to He /i.pc/i.pc,
C/i.pc/v.pc, N/v.pc, and O /v.pc. The spectrum is similar to those of the [WO]
central stars of Sand 3 and NGC 6905. We assign a spectral type of
[WO2]toKn15,butwenotethatN /v.pcisstrikinglystrong,indicating
a relatively nigh nitrogen abundance. We urge spectroscopy of all
sixstarsathigherspectralresolution,fordetailedmodel-atmosphere
analyses.
Bycomparingspectra ofKn15takenat fourdiÔ¨Äerentepochs,we
see variations in the equivalent widths of some emission lines by
factors of as much as 1.5. These spectrum variations are the largest
seen in any PNN, to our knowledge (other than the rare outbursts of
theO /v.pc/i.pc/PG1159nucleusofLo4),anddeservedetailedmonitoring.
Sand3,thecentralstarofNGC6905,andseveralotherearly-type
[WO] PNNi are multiperiodic pulsating variables (e.g., Bond et al.
1991;Ciardullo&Bond1996);thustime-domainphotometryofthe
Kn 15 nucleus would be of interest.
Similarly, about one-third of planetary nuclei and isolated WDs
that have PG1159 spectral types have been found to be pulsatingvariables, belonging to the GW Vir class (e.g., Ciardullo & Bond
1996; Werner & Herwig 2006; Althaus et al. 2010). For example,
bothoftheÔ¨ÅrsttwopulsatingPNNitobediscovered,K 1-16(Grauer
& Bond 1984) and Lo 4 (Bond & Meakes 1990), have PG 1159
spectra with the O /v.pc/i.pcdoublet in emission (e.g., Stanghellini et al.
1994; Bond 2014). Hence high-time-resolution photometry of our
Ô¨Åve PG1159 stars would be useful.
