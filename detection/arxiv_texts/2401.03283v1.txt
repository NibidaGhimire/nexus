 Abstract:  130 years ago, Omori formulated the first law of earthquake physics. The essence of 
the law is that the frequency of aftershocks decreases hyperbolically over time. 100 years ago, Hirano doubted the universality of Omori's law and proposed a power law for the evolution of 
aftershocks. Our paper is devoted to these two outstanding events, which played a significant 
role in the development of seismology. The paper also contains a brief summary of the modern 
approach to the construction of a phenomenological theory of afters hocks. Within the framework 
of the phenomenological approach, the epoch of harmonic evolution of the source, “cooling down” after the main shock, the bifurcation of the source, the cumulative effect of a round- the-
world echo, the modulation of global seism icity by spheroidal oscillations of the Earth, mirror 
triads, migration of aftershocks, and a number of other previously unknown geophysical 
phenomena were discovered. It is emphasized that the phenomenological theory has been formed 
in recent years on the  basis of a thorough analysis of the fundamental research of the pioneers 
who laid the foundations of modern seismology.

Introduction 
100 years ago, Hirano proposed a power law for the evolution of aftershocks from a 
strong earthquake [1], having doubted the universality of the hyperbolic law proclaimed by 
Omori 130 years ago [2]. Before describing these two outstanding events that played a 
significant role in the development of seismology, we will briefly outline the modern approach to 
constructing a phenomenological theory of aftershocks [3].  2 
  Let us define the earthquake source as a rock mass inside the convex shell of the 
aftershock envelope. Let us introduce the phenomenological parameter ()tσ , which generally 
characterizes the state of the source at time t. We will call the quantity σ the the source 
deactivation coefficient. We will assume that the σ value  indicates the rate at which the source 
loses its ability to excite aftershocks. Let us replace t with the so -called proper time as follows:  
 
()
0t
t dttσ′′=∫.     (1)  
 
Let's try to find the equation for the evolution of the source in the form of a differential equation 
() /0dn d f ntt+=, which describes the change in the frequency of aftershocks n over time. 
For obvious reasons, we will not be able to derive the equation of evolution from first principles. However, the equation can be guessed, and then the guess can be tested in an experiment. 
 It is known that the frequency of aftershocks on average decreases over time more slowly 
than e xponentially [4]. Therefore, the choice of a linear equation does not suit us. Let's try to use 
the simplest nonlinear equation  
 
20dnndt+= .      (2)  
 
 The choice [5] of the equation with quadratic nonlinearity turned out to be extremely 
successful. First, the evolution equation (2) allows for interesting generalizations [3, 6]. 
Secondly, and this is the main thing, it allows a new approach to the processing and analysis of 
aftershocks.  
Let us rewrite (2) in the form  
 
20dnndtσ+= ,     (3)  
 
and pose the inverse source problem for equation (3). The essence of the inverse problem is to 
calculate the deactivation coefficient ()tσ  from the aftershock frequency ()nt known from 
observations [7].  3 
 The procedure for calculating ()tσ  is simple. We introduce an auxiliary function 
()()1 1
0 gt n t n− −= − , where ()0 0 nn=  We rewrite (3) in the form of an integral relation  
 
()()
0t
t dt g tσ′′=∫.     (4)  
 
The formal solution to the task is obvious: /dg dtσ= . However, this solution is unstable, since 
the inverse problem is formulated incorrectly, as is usually the case when setting inverse 
problems in geophysics. The incorrectness is associated with rapid fluctuations of the function 
()nt. Regularization in this case comes down to smoothing the auxiliary function. As a result we 
have  
 
dgdtσ= ,      (5)  
 
where the angle brackets indicate the smoothing procedure.  
Within the framework of the phenomenological approach, a number of interesting 
geophysical phenomena have been discovered:  harmonic evolution of the source [8], source 
bifurcation [9], cumulative effect of round- the-world echo [10, 11], modulation of globa l 
seismicity by free vibrations of the Earth [12], mirror triads and solitary strong earthquakes [13], migration of aftershocks [14].  
We emphasize that, following Hugo, we recognize that the new is based on the previous. 
And we fully understand that the phenomenological theory of aftershocks [3] was formed under 
the strong influence of the works of the founders of seismology [1, 2] . 
 
Omori (1894)  
It is best to start describing the outstanding events of a century ago from afar. In 1850, 
John Milne was born in Liverpool, who in the future was to become a famous geophysicist, one 
of the founders of modern seismology [15]. He was educated in London, worked as a mining 
engineer in Newfoundland, as a geologist in the Sinai Peninsula, and from 1875 to 1895 worked 
in Tokyo at the invitation of the government of the Japanese Empire. It is curious that in search 
of adventure, Milne traveled to Tokyo for three months, mostly by land (via Siberia). In 1880, he 
created a horizontal pendulum seismograph -  the first easy -to-use and sufficiently sensitive 
instrument for recording earthquakes.  4 
  
 In 1887 Milne was elected a member of the Royal Society. He manages to convince the 
Society to allocate funds for the creation of a world network of seismic stations equipped with his instruments. Japan highly appreciated Milne's services to the country and the world. Emperor 
Meiji awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun and awarded him a lifetime pension of 1,000 yen. The University of Tokyo elected him honorary professor.  
 Fusakichi Omori was a student of John Milne. He enjoyed the encouraging support of his 
teacher, as did all young Japanese seismologists of that time. On October 28, 1891, the 
earthquake with a magnitude of M  = 8 occurred.  Milne's seismographs recorded numerous 
aftershocks. Analysis of these aftershocks allowed Omori to formulate the law that bears his 
name [2]. It is worth mentioning that he was 26 years old at the time.  
 Omori's Law states that after a strong earthquake, the frequency of aftershocks, i.e. 
tremors fo llowing the main shock, on average, decreases hyperbolically over time:  
 
()kntct=+.      (6)  
 
Here 0k>, 0c>, 0t≥. This was the first law of earthquake physics, if we keep in mind the 
chronological sequence of outstan ding discoveries in seismology.  
 Intuition tells us that the Omori formula (6) has the characteristics of a fundamental law 
of nature. Let's explain what was said. Firstly, (6) can be rewritten in the equiv alent form 
/ n kt= , where 0k>, 0t>. In fact, contrary to popular belief, the parameter in (6) is free due 
to the homogeneity of the flow of time t. In other words, Omori’s law is one -parameter: the 
value of k generally characterizes the source of an earthquake over the entire history of the 
evolution of aftershocks. 
Secondly, according to Omori 2/ 1/dn dt t∝− , which immediately causes us to associate 
with the nonlinear equation for the evolution of aftershocks (2). It becomes clear that Omori's 
law, if it is true, is a very specific solution of the more general law (2). Let's find the state of the 
source in which Omori's law (6) directly follows from the fundamental phenomenological 
equation (2).  
 The general solution of equation (2) is  
 
()0
01nnntt=+.     (7)  5 
  Taking (1) into account, it is easy to see that Omori’s law (6) follows from (7) under the 
condition onstcσ= . In this case 1/kσ= , 01/cnσ= . In other words, Omori's law is satisfied 
provided that the  deactivation coefficient remains unchanged throughout the entire history of 
aftershock excitation.  
 The found condition for the applicability of the Omori law is tough. Is it carried out 
experimentally? To answer the question, we compiled the Aftershock A tlas [8], which presents 
solutions to the inverse source problem. The characteristic size of the source was determined 
according to the method [16].  
 Analysis of solutions for several dozen events indicates that in all cases, at the first stage 
of the evol ution of aftershocks, immediately after the main shock, the source deactivation 
coefficient remains unchanged within the limits of measurement accuracy. We call the time 
interval during which constσ=  the Epoch of Hyperbolic Evolution (EH E) , or Omori epoch. 
The duration of EHE varies from case to case from a few days to several months. Figure 1 shows  
a case of a fairly long EHE, almost equal to 100 days. There is a tendency for σ to decrease 
with increasing magnitude of the main shock [17].

with magnitude М = 6.7 at a depth of H=18.2 km in Southern California on 1994.01.17 
(Northridge earthquake ). 
 
 The discovery of the Omori epoch is extremely significant. At the end of the epoch, the 
state of the source changes. Let's introduce parameter /d dtθσ= . In the Omori epoch, 0θ=. 
The transition to a new state is indicated by a sharp jump in parameter θ (Figure 2).  This 
suggests that the end of the Omori epoch is accompanied by a bifurcation of the earthquake 
source.

Fig. 2. Piecewise linear approximation of the deactivation coefficient (left) and its time 
derivative (right). The event occurred on November 23, 1984 in Northern California. The 
magnitude of the main impact is M  = 6, the depth of the hypocenter is 10 km. 
 
A convincing illustration of this is Figure 3. It shows the result of processing and 
analyzing eight events. The transition from one mode of source deactivation to a qualitatively 
different mode is abrupt in the sense that its duration is much less than the dura tion of the Omori 
epoch.

earthquake source after the end of the Omori epoch (see text). The vertical axis shows the 
deactivation factor minus the value of this factor at the beginning of the Omori epoch. The 
critical point is aligned with zero point in time.  
 
Let us summarize the preliminary results of studying the evolution of aftershocks by 
solving the inverse problem:  
1. The Omori formula (6) has the status of a law that is fulfilled with good accuracy in a 
real geophysical process.  
7 
 2. The applicability of Omori's law is strictly limited to the epoch of harmonic evolution 
of the earthquake source.  
3. At the end of epoch of harmonic evolution, the source experiences a bi furcation.  
To conclude the section devoted to Fusakichi Omori, let us return to formulas (6) and (7). 
The law of aftershocks (7) formally differs from law (6) only in that in it time t is replaced by 
proper time t. The concept of proper time and the corresponding term were introduced into 
physics only at the beginning of the 20th century. It would seem that Omori simply did not have 
the opportunity to use the concept of proper time in order  to give formula (6) the flexibility and 
physical meaning that our formula (7) has. In this regard, we want to clarify that the source 
proper time (1) is not directly related to the relativistic proper time. Formulas of the form (1) 
express the uneven func tioning of any dynamic system immersed in a nonstationary environment 
or located in nonstationary external force fields. In our case, formula (1) takes into account the 
non-stationary state of the source that experienced the main shock of the earthquake.  
 
Hirano (1924)  
100 years ago, an event occurred that determined for a long time the style of studying the 
evolution of aftershocks: Hirano published an article [1], in which he proposed replacing 
Omori’s law (6) with a power law of the form  
 
()
()pknt
ct=
+.     (8)  
 
 The years went by. In 1938, the famous mathematician and geophysicist Jeffreys drew 
attention to Hirano's formula [19]. Another couple of decades passed. And so, thanks to the 
efforts of Utsu [20 –22], formula (8) final ly attracted the close attention of seismologists. Since 
then, formula (8) has become firmly established in the practice of aftershock research. It was 
found that the exponent is on average 1.1.p= , but varies from case to case within wide limits 
(approximately from 0.7 to 1.5). 
 Formula (8), like Omori formula (6), is one -parameter. In fact, we have already spoken 
about the parameter c in connection with formula (6). As for the parameter k, it does not have 
any physical meaning for Hirano, since it does not have a fixed dimension. The dimension k 
depends on the value p, and this is not accepted in physics. Thus, the Hirano- Utsu formula (8) 
does not have the status of a geophysical law, but nothing prevents us from considering it as a 
completely acceptable fitting formula for approximating observational data.  8 
 We would like, with the greatest respect to the discoverer, to express directly our opinion 
that Hirano's search for a correct aftershock formula, different from the Omori formula, was 
justified, since the Omori formula (6) is not universal. Another thing is that the choice of 
Hiroano's formula ( 8) turned out to be unsuccessful. However, it would be a mistake to think that 
we do not appreciate Hirano's creative efforts. After all, we always take risks, since our main 
method of searching for scientific truth is trial and error. One way or another, the long search in 
this direction, begun by Milne and Omori in the century before last, continued by Hirano and 
Utsu in the last century, has finally been successfully completed. The universal one -parameter 
formula for the evolution of aftershocks (7) has been found.  It differs from the Omori f ormula 
(6) in that it takes into account the difference between the proper time t and the world time t. 
 And finally, one more historical observation. It is quite clear that formulas (6) –(8) are not 
only pictograms that schematically reflect one or another seismologist’s idea of the direction of 
the evolution of aftershocks. These formulas are primarily and m ainly tools for processing and 
analyzing observations in order to calculate the phenomenological parameters of the earthquake 
source. Omori formula (6) allows you to calculate the parameter k. The Hirano- Utsu formula (8) 
allows you to calculate parameter p. Formula (7), by which we calculate the source deactivation 
factor σ, turned out to be logically more justified and much more effective.  
 
Discussion  
We believe that the arguments in favor of the phenomenological theory of aftershocks are 
stronger and more convincing than the arguments in favor of the old theory based on the Hirano -
Utsu formula. One of the arguments in favor of a differential evolution equation containing 
quadratic nonlinearity is that the form of the equation suggests natural and very effective 
generalizations.  
An obvious generalization of (2) is the inhomogeneous differential equation  
 
()2 dnn ftdt+= .     (9)  
 
The free term ()ft  can be used to formally describe the triggers that induce aftershocks. Here 
we remember two endogenous triggers, one of which is pulsed ( ()() ft tδ∝ ), and the second 
sinusoidal ( ()() sin ft t ω∝ ). The idea is that the main shock of an earthquake excites two non -9 
 trivial triggers, namely, a round- the-world seismic echo and free vibrations of the Earth, which 
can affect the dynamics of t he “cooling” earthquake source.  
With some stretch, the theory of the two triggers we have indicate d could be called semi -
phenomenological, since at least the echo delay time and the period of free oscillations of the 
Earth are calculated within the framework of the fundamental theory of elastic oscillations of the 
Earth. In the future, we expect that t he phenomenological parameters and, above all, the source 
deactivation coefficient will be calculated on the basis of first principles, just as the gas temperature is calculated within the framework of kinetic theory. But the theory of aftershocks is 
still very, very far from such an ideal.  
 Generally speaking, generalization (9) is quite trivial. And it only designates exogenous 
and endogenous triggers, helps to classify them and the like . A nontrivial generalization of 
equation (2) is the logistic equatio n for aftershocks [23]  
 
()dnnndtγσ= −      (10)  
 
This equation is well known in biology, chemistry, sociology and other sciences. Here γ is the 
second phenomenological parameter of our theory.  Its approximate estimate can be made using 
the formula nγσ∞= , where n∞ is the frequency of tremors in the background seismicity regime, 
𝑛𝑛∞≪𝑛𝑛0. 
It should be noted that we were led to the logistic equation (9) by the research of Faraoni 
[24], who saw a remarkable analogy between the aftershocks equation (2) and one of Friedman’s equations, which describes the expanding Universe. Equation (9) describes the evolution of 
aftershocks under conditions of limited infl ux of free energy and negative entropy into the 
source. An interesting perspective opens up when considering the stochastic analogue of the logistic equation for aftershocks. 
We started with the simplest nonlinear evolution equation (2), carefully substant iated its 
applicability for describing aftershocks, and with great care made minimal generalizations 
reflecting certain features of the source dynamics, while trying not to destroy the basis of our 
phenomenological theory.  Now we want, with all the necessary reservations, to make a radical 
generalization and consider the source as a spatially extended object [3, 7, 14, 25]. To do this, we 
replace the frequency of aftershocks ()nt  with the distribution density of aftershocks (),ntx, 
where (),,xyz=x  are the coordinates of the hypocenter. If the distribution of epicenters is 
analyzed, then (),xy=x  should be set and the origin of the coordinate system should be aligned 10 
 with the epicent er of the main shock. Finally, sometimes the epicenters of aftershocks are located 
predominantly in the vicinity of a long fault in the earth's crust. In this case, a simplified 
description of the distribution of aftershocks using the function (),ntx  is acceptable, with the 
distance x measured along the fault.  
To describe space -time dynamics, we need a partial differential equation. Trying to make 
minimal changes to the logistic equation for the evolution of aftershocks, we add to its right side 
an additional term of the form ()ˆ , Lntx, in which L is a linear differential operator. Let's take 
22 ˆ / Lx= ∂∂  and get the equation for the spatiotemporal evolution of aftershocks  
 
()2
2nnn nDtxγσ∂∂=−+∂∂.     (11)  
 
Here D is the third phenomenological parameter of our theory.  
 The nonlinear diffusion equation (11) is known in mathematics as the Kolmogorov–
Petrovsky –Piskunov equation [26]. It has solutions in the form of stationary waves propagating 
with velo сity 𝑉𝑉~�𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷. Knowing V and γ, we can estimate the diffusion coefficient D. 
Along this path, the complex task of experimentally searching for directional migration of 
aftershocks was formed. The problem was first successfully solved in [14] (see also [3, 25]). The 
difficulty is this. We want to consider the source as a kind of track detector. We will monitor the 
movement of aftershocks and try to estimate the velocity of movement. But we talk about the 
movement of aftershocks only figuratively. Each discontinuity that excites an aftershock occurs 
locally. In fact, the localzation of the sequence of ruptures moves underground. 
 Leaving aside subtle conceptual issues, we want to make quite convincing only the very 
fact of the slow systematic removal of aftershocks from the epicenter of the main shock. To do 
this, we need a large amount of observational data. We extracted information on 138 events from 
the USGS/NEIC catalog for the years 1973–2019. Mai n shocks with magnitude M  > 7.5 were 
selected. We processed 34627 aftershocks that were observed within 100 days after the main 
shocks. The processing consisted, firstly, in synchronizing events according to the time of the 
main shock. Secondly, a non- standard technique for ordering aftershocks was used, proposed by 
one of the authors (Oleg Zotov): aftershocks were combined into clusters, each of which was 
determined by the aftershock serial number. Clustering smooths out sharp differences in the 
deactivati on coefficient, on which the rate of flow of proper time in the source depends. Finally, 11 
 the average distance 22r xy= +  between the aftershocks and the main shock was calculated 
for each cluster. The result is shown in Figure 4. Red line  
 
[]km 0.08 67.9rj= +      (12)  
 
approximates experimental points. Here j is the cluster number. The correlation coefficient is 
0.78. Undoubtedly, aftershocks move away from the main shock over time.  
 
 
Fig. 4. Removal of aftershock epicenters from the main shock epicenter over time during the 
evolution of the earthquake source.  
 
Recognizing that the flow of aftershocks moves away from the main shock is a big step 
toward understanding earthquake mechanics. Here the key results have not yet been obtained. 
We still have to learn how to calculate the flow of Umoff’s mechanical energy in the source of 
earthquake. We need to understand the mechanism of formation of the Umoff flow velocity in a 
rock mass . Intuition tells us that the divergent flow of aftershock energy may correspond to a 
converging flow of foreshock energy, and we still have to test this hypothesis experimentally.  
 So, 130 years have passed since the search for the law of aftershock evolution began. The  
process turned out to be complex and contradictory. And, of course, one cannot say that the 
process has already been completed. But we can make a number of statements quite definitely:  
– the law of aftershock evolution has the form of a differential equat ion containing 
quadratic nonlinearity,  
– Omori’s law is fulfilled, but has a time -limited range of applicability,  
12 
 – at the end of the Omori epoch, the state of the source as a dynamic system changes 
sharply, which probably indicates the phenomenon of bifur cation,  
– there is a slow removal of the epicenters of aftershocks from the epicenter of the main 
shock. 
 
Conclusion  
So, at the end of the century before last in Japan, the birth of modern seismology 
occurred due to the fact that at this time and in this place the urgent need of society, state support 
and human genius miraculously united. We recalled the background and briefly told the story of 
the discovery of the first law of earthquake physics. 
At the beginning of the last century, Hirano drew attention to the fact that the Omori 
formula does not always satisfactorily describe the flow of aftershocks, and proposed his own 
version of the law of evolution. Several decades later, Utsu carried out a series of studies using 
Hirano's formula to process and ana lyze observations. 
 The results obtained by Utsu aroused keen interest, were continued, and generated an 
extensive literature. A thorough study of research carried out using the Utsu method led us to the 
idea of constructing a phenomenological theory of af tershocks, starting from the simplest 
differential evolution equation with quadratic nonlinearity.  
Within the framework of the phenomenological approach to the physics of aftershocks, it 
was possible to obtain a number of previously unknown results. In conclusion, we list some of 
them again:  
1. It has been established that Omori’s law is true, but only for a limited period of time after 
the main shock, 
2.  The phenomenon of bifurcation at the end of the epoch of harmonic evolution of the 
source was discovered,  
3. The Hirano -Utsu formula has been analyzed and shown that it can be used as a fitting 
formula, but does not have the status of a geophysical law,  
4. The cumulative effect of round- the-world seismic echo was predicted and discovered,  
5. Modulation of global seismici ty by spheroidal oscillations of the Earth was discovered,  
6. The phenomenon of aftershock migration was discovered, and an interpretation of 
migration was proposed within the framework of the Kolmogorov -Petrovsky -Piskunov 
theory of nonlinear diffusion waves.  
 
 The work was carried out according to the plan of state assignments of Schmidt Institute 
of Physics of the Earth, Russian Academy of Sciences . 13
