Abstract
Advances in hybrid fractional quantum Hall (FQH)-superconductor platforms pave the
way for realisation of parafermionic modes. We analyse signatures of these non-abelian
anyons in transport measurements across devices with Z6parafermions (PFs) coupled
to an external electrode. Simulating the dynamics of these open systems by a stochastic
quantum jump method, we show that a current readout over sufficiently long times con-
stitutes a projective measurement of the fractional charge shared by two PFs. Interaction
of these topological modes with the FQH environment, however, may cause poisoning
events affecting this degree of freedom which we model by jump operators that describe
incoherent coupling of PFs with FQH edge modes. We analyse how this gives rise to a
characteristic three-level telegraph noise in the current, constituting a very strong sig-
nature of PFs. We discuss also other forms of poisoning and noise caused by interaction
with fractional quasiparticles in the bulk of the Hall system. We conclude our work with
an analysis of four-PF devices, in particular on how the PF fusion algebra can be observed
in electrical transport experiments.

1 Introduction
Experimental advances in the field of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems and their inte-
gration with superconducting elements [1, 2]have sparked hope to engineer parafermionic
zero-energy modes. These modes, for brevity also called parafermions (PFs), are emergent
topological low-energy excitations that obey non-abelian braiding statistics. This makes them
an interesting building block for engineering phases of matter with exotic kinds of topological
order and potential candidates to encode quantum information in a non-local way [3]. PFs
are predicted to be localised at domain walls between e.g. a superconductor (SC) and a fer-
romagnet, each inducing a gap in the same counterpropagating fractional edge modes [4–9].
Promising signals of the required superconducting coupling and the related crossed Andreev
reflection have been reported in Ref. [2]. Here a superconducting thin finger of niobium ni-
tride was positioned in the trench of a graphene Hall bar encapsulated in boron nitride, and
a negative Hall resistance was measured for several FQH states including the incompressible
liquid with filling ν=1/3. In what follows, we focus on this specific filling factor.
It has been argued that the effects of dissipation via single-electron tunnelling into SC vor-
tices may play an important role for these experimental observations [10], which therefore
constitute a promising but not conclusive indication of the onset of PFs. Alternative and more
direct experimental investigations of hybrid FQH-SC systems are thus desirable to verify the
appearance of these fractional low-energy modes. To this purpose, Ref. [11]proposed FQH-SC
setups to study the physics of PFs based on electronic transport measurements. The simplest
scenario is offered by devices hosting a pair of these non-abelian anyons, the state of which
can be characterised by their shared number of fractional ( e/3) electron charges modulo one
Cooper pair. When coupling them to a normal metallic lead, their fractional charge mod 1 e
and thus their fusion channel can be detected indirectly by transport spectroscopy: the con-
ductance reveals the energy spectrum of the two-PF system which, in turn, depends on their
conserved charge ˜qe/3, where ˜q=0, 1, 2 is the reduced charge number.
The ideal topological protection of this degree of freedom is broken if fractional quasiparti-
cles enter or leave the PF system and change the charge by ±e/3. Such quasiparticle poisoning
could, for example, originate from a coupling with the gapless edge modes of the FQH liquid.
If the related poisoning rate is weak with respect to all other energy scales of the system, the
onset of a three-level telegraph noise in the conductance signal is expected [11]. In this work,
we build a framework to study the features of the transport dynamics and noise of these PF
systems out of equilibrium. We distinguish the case in which PFs are incoherently poisoned
2SciPost Physics Submission
by a fractional quasiparticle bath from the case of PFs coherently coupled to fractional parti-
cles in the system as, for instance, in the presence of antidots formed in the bulk of the FQH
liquid [12,13 ]. In both cases the shared fractional charge ˜qis not conserved, and for coherent
couplings, the state of the PFs must be described, in general, by a linear superposition of the
different charge states. We will adopt a quantum jump method [14, 15 ]to model how the
continuous current readout in a two-PF device turns into a projective measurement of this
degree of freedom for sufficiently long times. The same method will allow us to study the
onset of a telegraph noise present both when including incoherent sources of fractional par-
ticles and when the coherent dynamics of the system competes with the continuous current
measurement.
We will present the limitations and timescales over which the fusion of pairs of PFs can
be measured in systems with more than two PFs. This is crucial for engineering protocols for
the manipulation and measurement of larger sets of PFs with the potential applications to-
wards topological quantum computation in mind. In particular, both the investigation of the
associativity of the anyonic fusion rules, and the braiding, must be based on the possibility
of manipulating (at least) four PFs and measuring their fusion outcomes (see, for instance,
Refs. [16, 17 ]). We will propose a proof-of-principle protocol to detect the associativity rules
restricted to the fractional charge ˜qthrough transport measurements and estimate its limita-
tions in terms of timescales as dictated by the out-of-equilibrium quantum jump simulations.
The structure of this work is as follows: In Sec. 2 we present the basic setup to study the
dynamics of PFs coupled to an external electrode and introduce in Sec. 2.1 the quantum jump
method to describe the evolution of this open system. We discuss in Sec. 2.2 the measurement
induced projection of superpositions of states into separate charge sectors and give estimates
for the current within each of these in Sec. 2.3. In Sec. 3 we include a coupling to the external
edges of the FQH system and use the same quantum jump technique to model poisoning by
including jump operators associated with fractional quasiparticles. We find that the current
displays three-level telegraph noise corresponding to e/3 charges entering or leaving the PF
system. In Sec. 4 we consider an antidot as a coherent poisoning source and discuss the
resulting two-level telegraph noise. In Sec. 5 we extend the description to a system of four PFs
and investigate their fusion algebra and a possible protocol for studying its associativity rules
in Sec. 5.1. In Sec. 5.2 we propose a construction to realise tunability of the PF couplings.
We present our conclusions in Sec. 6. The appendices provide an overview of the physical
parameters (App. A), technical details of the quantum jump method (App. B), the extension
of jump operators to fractional modes (App. C), numerical results for strong environment
interaction (App. D) and details on the associativity matrix of Z6PFs (App. E).

2 Readout dynamics of two parafermions
A minimal setup for studying transport readouts of PFs is sketched in Fig. 1. A thin SC is placed
in a trench of the ν=1/3 FQH liquid (a graphene, boron nitride and graphite heterostructure
in Ref. [2]) and induces superconducting pairing between counterpropagating edge modes in
the presence of strong spin orbit coupling (as in niobium nitride). At the ends of the SC the
edge modes are backscattered by the quantum Hall gap and, from a low-energy field theory
description of the system, one Z6PF is expected to emerge at each end of the SC [5,7]. Each PF
is described by an effective operator αi, such thatα1α2=eiπ/3α2α1. One of the PFs is coupled
to a normal metallic lead at a voltage bias Vbwith respect to the grounded SC. The state of
the two PFs can be characterised by a parity operator e−iπ/6α†
2α1=e−iπq/3[18]where the

At each end of the SC there is a localised PF (red stars) and the two couple with a

number operator qcounts the fractional charges e/3 modulo one Cooper pair in the segment
of edge modes gapped by the SC. Analogously to Majorana modes in a topological SC, the two
PFs interact via a coupling ϵ, exponentially suppressed with their distance. Consequently, the
sixfold degenerate groundstate of the system is split by
H2pf=−2ϵcos(πq/3+φ), (1)
where the phase φdepends on the chemical potential of the edge modes and the length of the
SC[19,20 ]. For a single pair of PFs this splitting, and thereby q(mod 3), can be read indirectly
by a conductance measurement where a current runs between the lead and the grounded SC,
through the PFs.
To discuss this readout procedure, we describe the coupling with the lead by the Hamil-
tonian Hc=iηα3

, whereηis the coupling strength between the lead and the left PF ,
andlis the annihilation operator for an electron at the end of the lead [21–25 ].Hcincludes
both charge-conserving processes in which one electron in the lead is decomposed into three
fractional quasiparticles (see, for instance, Ref. [26]) and Andreev-like processes that addi-
tionally involve the creation or annihilation of a Cooper pair in the SC. Due to the lead-PF
coupling Hc,qis no longer a conserved quantity, but the six PF states are divided into three
sectors labelled by the fractional charge ˜q=qmod 3, which is a degree of freedom protected
against the electron tunnelling. The Hamiltonian thus separates into three independent non-
interacting models. At resonance for a given ˜qsector, eVb=4ϵcos(4π˜q/3+φ)≡∆ϵ(˜q), the
zero-temperature conductance is quantized to G˜q=2e2/h. In general, the conductance can
assume three different values depending on ˜qfor suitableη,Vb,ϵand temperature T. These
values can be resolved as long as the phase φresults in sufficiently different energy splittings
for each ˜qsector [11]. In this work we present data for the optimal point φ=arctan (1/p
27),
but our results do not qualitatively depend on this specific choice.
Based on the results in Ref. [19], the estimates of the PF energy splitting in Ref. [11]and
realistic parameters in hybrid graphene FQH-SC devices [2], it is convenient to introduce the
energy scaleλ=2π·2.4 GHz, which we will refer to throughout this work. Unless otherwise
specified we take ϵ=λandT=λ/3.
2.1 Electron jump operators for a two-parafermion system
To obtain reliable predictions that can be tested in future experiments, we analyse the dynamics
of an open system in which the PFs are coupled to the external environment provided by the
4SciPost Physics Submission
metallic electrode. In this work, we focus on the electrical current signatures of such effects.
To study the coupling with the metallic lead, we assume that this electron reservoir behaves
as a Markovian bath, i.e. the correlation time of electrons in the lead is the shortest timescale
in the system dynamics [27]. An ideal tool to calculate the evolution of such systems is the
stochastic quantum jump method [14,15,28–30 ]. With that, we can calculate trajectories for
different initial states of the PF system and estimate the evolution of the fractional charge ˜q
and the current through the normal lead. To this end, we introduce jump operators Le
+and
Le
−that move a charge efrom the lead to the PFs and vice versa. Following [27,30 ]we define
them as
Le
±=i5X
q=0q
ΓJ±(Ξq,Vb)|q〉〈q+3|,Γ=2πνl|η|2, (2)
where the coupling rate Γdepends on the density of states in the lead νl, and J+(−)is the two-
point correlation function of the l(l†) operator evaluated at the energy Ξq=4ϵcos(πq/3+φ).
This energy describes transitions between eigenstates with charge numbers qandq±3 ofH2pf
in Eq. (1). In terms of the Fermi-Dirac distribution, nF(ω,Vb) = ( 1+exp[(ω−eVb)/T])−1,
the correlation function reads:
J±(Ξq,Vb) =nF(−Ξq,±Vb). (3)
Our definition of the jump operators relies on an assumption of immediate projection of elec-
trons in the lead, meaning that the application of Le
±directly corresponds to a charge moving
back or forth. This allows us to obtain an estimate of the current by keeping track of the
number of times the two jump operators are applied under the evolution of the PF state. We
quantify the current signal by averaging the difference of electron jumps in and out of the PF
system over a time window tavg. The trajectories of the quantum jump method are calculated
with Monte Carlo simulations where the state evolution is divided into small time steps δt
with respect to 2 πΓ−1. Within each time step, there is a small probability ∝Γδtthat one of
the jump operators is applied to the state thereby changing the PF charge q→q±3. Further
details of the protocol are described in App. B, and the source code is available online [31].
We do not include the Lamb shift in the treatment of the PF systems since there are no near-
degeneracies in H2pf(avoidingφclose to multiples of π/6), and it only gives an overall shift
of the spectrum and small corrections ≲3νl|η|2≈Γ/2[27]. We stress the advantage of
the quantum jump technique for the purpose of calculating distinct trajectories, relevant for
comparing with experimental outcomes, whereas the Lindblad master equation [27]would
provide only an ensemble average over the individual trajectory realisations.
2.2 Projection of charge sectors
With the method outlined above, we investigate now the time evolution of a two-PF system
described by the Hamiltonian H2pfin Eq. (1). We focus on the reduced charge ˜qand investigate
how it is projectively measured by the current. We fix the coupling rate to Γ=0.1λfrom here
on.
If the initial state |ψi〉is an eigenstate of ˜q, i.e. a linear superposition of the states |q〉and
|q+3 mod 6〉, the time-evolved state remains within the same charge sector. If instead the
initial state is a superposition of states with different ˜q, the current measurement modelled by
the jump operators projects to a fixed, but random ˜qfor sufficiently long times. To test a "worst-
case" scenario, we take as the initial state an equal superposition of all the charge states, |equal〉

jump of an electron between the lead and the PFs consists a weakly projective measurement
and on average,〈˜q〉should with equal probability 1 /3 evolve into 0 or 2 or remain 1. Fig. 2(a)
depicts the evolution of 〈˜q〉(colour scale) in a single random trajectory for different values of

the voltage bias Vb. We observe that on a timescale of order 2 πΓ−1≈4 ns, the interaction
with the lead is not sufficient to project the state into a given ˜qsector except from a few
cases for voltages around the resonance energies Ξq. Inspired by the inverse participation
ratio, we introduce the following quantitative measure of the projection of a general state

This is 1 /3 for the initial state |equal〉and evolves towards 1 when the state is progressively
projected into only one of the charge sectors. In Fig. 2(a) we mark by a red dot the time tproj
whenζon a trajectory reaches the value ζ∗=0.9. The many red dots in the top are to illustrate
that our projection measure has not reached this threshold within the simulation time. This
supports our interpretation of the uneven distribution among charge sectors as a consequence
of the fact that the state is not projected on this timescale and remains a superposition of ˜q
sectors.
On a much longer timescale of O(103(2πΓ−1)), we see better the projection of states
(Fig. 2(b)). Still, the projection is slowest at voltages away from Ξqaccording to both 〈˜q〉
and ourζ∗measure. In additional simulations that we do not show here, both estimates indi-
cate that the projection time is shortened with an increase in temperature as one would expect.
We remark that the projection time is highly sensitive to the initial state and that it decreases
considerably for the simpler superposition of charge sectors1p
3(|q=0〉+|q=1〉+|q=2〉),
as shown in App. B. Furthermore, the projection times depicted in Fig. 2(b) show that the
current measurements should be performed at voltages around the Ξqresonances in order to
minimize the readout time of the charge ˜q. The qualitative behaviour of the projection time as
a function of VbandTcan also be estimated by analysis of the decay rates of the wave function
components which characterise the continuous part of the evolution during a stochastic tra-
jectory. In App. B we argue on this basis that, as mentioned above, the state |equal〉represents
a worst-case scenario in terms of projection time for the purpose of a readout of ˜q.

2.3 Current behaviour of a two-parafermion system
As described in Sec. 2.1, we can obtain an estimate of the current trajectories in the metallic
lead connected to the PFs by the quantum jump method. Here we present predictions for the
current signal including noise for experimental situations where the reduced charge number
˜qis a conserved quantity. As a benchmark of our method, we compare our results for the
average current and noise to the ones of the Landauer-Büttiker formalism [32,33 ].
In Fig. 3(a) we plot estimates of the current within the three different charge sectors
˜q=0, 1, 2: for different values of the bias Vb, we initialise the PFs in an equal superposition
of|q=˜q〉and|q=˜q+3〉and consider a single random trajectory as dictated by the quantum
jump method. For each ˜q, the PF state remains a superposition of |˜q〉and|˜q+3〉. At the dif-
ferent voltages, we report the average value of the current I˜qnumerically observed during a
time window tavg=0.1µs (see App. B for further details). From Fig. 3(a) the current signals
of the different sectors appear to be distinguishable for certain ranges of Vb.
We now compare this with the non-perturbative result of the Landauer-Büttiker formalism,
applicable for effectively non-interacting systems like the two-PF setup treated in this section.
We state below the zero-temperature differential conductance, the finite-temperature current
and the zero-frequency noise, respectively:

sector. In Fig. 3(b) we plot these expressions for current and noise with the same parameters as
in Fig. 3(a) and one sees that they agree well with the numerical estimates. From these results
we conclude that it is possible to distinguish the signals from each sector for appropriate values
of the voltage bias.
The results discussed so far rely on the conservation of the charge ˜qin the open two-PF
system. Two important aspects, however, must be further considered. First, a realistic exper-
imental scenario will be characterized by fractional quasiparticle poisoning. Such poisoning
is, for instance, responsible for the onset of telegraph noise in FQH Fabry-Perrot interferom-
eters [34](see also the related simulations in Ref. [35]). In order to successfully perform a
transport readout of the PF state, it is necessary that any poisoning time is much larger than
the projection times estimated in this section. Second, to obtain a linear superposition of states
with different charge ˜q, it is necessary to include in the analysis of the PF setup a further sub-
system that can coherently exchange fractional quasiparticles with the PFs. In the following
sections, we address these important points.
3 Quasiparticle poisoning and three-level telegraph noise
The setup presented in the previous section is inspired by the hybrid FQH-SC systems anal-
ysed in Refs. [1,2](see also the theoretical setups in Ref. [36]). These platforms can in general
be subject to two sources of fractional quasiparticle poisoning that affect the stability of the
fractional charge ˜q. The first is given by quasiholes and quasiparticles in the bulk of the in-
compressible Hall liquid. Since these fractional excitations are characterised by an energy
gap∆FQH, it is expected that they become localised in a glass state by disorder effects at low
temperatures [35]. This scenario is consistent with the interferometry experiments in GaAs
platforms (see, for instance, Refs. [34,37,38 ]), and suggests that bulk excitations provide only
a minor contribution to poisoning events for T≪∆FQH. The second source is more relevant
and is constituted by the chiral gapless edge modes in the system. To include this source of poi-
soning in our analysis, we consider the external edge of the system as a reservoir of fractional
quasiparticles, and we assume a weak incoherent coupling between the chiral gapless modes
and one of the two PFs. This is illustrated in Fig. 4. Specifically, we assume the coupling to be
Hc,edge =ηe/3(α2ψ†
e/3+ψe/3α†
2), (8)
whereψe/3is the edge mode annihilation operator taken at a given position along the edge,
and only the right PF ( α2) couples to this gapless mode. More general interactions coupling
both PFs with an extended region of the edge can be considered but do not qualitatively affect
our results. We expect the tunnelling amplitude ηe/3of the fractional quasiparticles to decrease
with the distance of α2from the edge and with the energy gap ∆FQH.
Based on the coupling in Eq. (8), we now introduce two additional jump operators Le/3

the projection happens very fast, O(10 ns ), at the specific voltage. The blue, orange
and green horizontal lines correspond to the mean value of the current in the sectors
˜q=0, 1 and 2, respectively, in the absence of poisoning. Jumps between the current
levels are due to a charge e/3 entering or leaving the PF system via the outermost FQH
edge. For the FQH gap in graphene we use the typical value ∆FQH=1.7 meV [42,43 ]
and we setµ=0.
describing incoherent jumps of e/3 charges from the edge into the PF system and vice versa.
These operators are derived in App. C by extending the procedure in Refs. [27,30 ]to the case of
fractional charge operators in ideal Laughlin edge states. They depend on the anyonic spectral
function ˜dwhich results from the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation function in
time of the operator ψe/3. In particular, we consider the explicit expression for this spectral
function presented in Refs. [39,40 ], and by including ∆FQHas an ultraviolet cutoff we obtain:

where we introduced the fractional poisoning rate Γe/3=2π|ηe/3|2β, and Eqlabels the eigen-
values of H2pfin Eq. (1). Eq. (10) implies that the average rate of poisoning events is affected
by the anyonic distribution ˜d. It is important to notice that, as the Bose-Einstein distribu-
tion,β˜ddiverges at E=µin the zero-temperature limit due to anyonic condensation [39].
Therefore, in the special resonant cases where Eq∓1−Eq=±µ, the low-temperature limit of
Eq. (10) would give rise to a dramatic increase of the effective poisoning rate, and the as-
sumptions necessary for applying the quantum jump method would no longer be valid. These
zero-temperature resonances, however, are on one side easily avoided by small shifts of µ
which can be controlled by varying the potential of the edge. On the other side, they have
only a negligible effect at experimentally relevant temperatures ≥10 mK and for a FQH gap
∆FQH=1.7 meV (see App. C for further details).
Using the quantum jump method with the two jump operators in Eq. (10) together with
the ones in Eq. (2), we can get numerical estimates of the current from the external lead to the

system also in the presence of poisoning effects. Again, our results rely on the assumption that
the edge modes relax on a short timescale like the lead modes (Markovian approximation). In
Fig. 5 we show a stochastic trajectory of the current as a function of time at fixed voltage for a
weak poisoning rate Γe/3≈0.002Γand the initial state |equal〉. We observe jumps between the
three current levels of ˜q=0, 1, 2 that are otherwise well-separated and stable. Furthermore,
we recognise that the jumps can happen from one level to any of the other two. For the chosen
parameters the poisoning time is 2 πΓ−1
e/3=1.8µs and much longer than the projection time
which is O(10 ns ). The example of current evolution in Fig. 5 displays less frequent occupation
of the ˜q=0 sector than of the other two. We quantify this and confirm that it is a general
trend for the chosen parameter values by considering the Lindblad master equation [27]for
the steady state density matrix ρ0:

The steady state obtained with the parameters stated in Fig. 5 yields probabilities 0.17, 0.44
and 0.39 for the charge sectors ˜q=0, 1 and 2, respectively, which fits well the example in
Fig. 5. By increasing the fractional rate Γe/3we find that Γe/3≈0.02Γis an approximate
upper bound for the three-level telegraph behaviour to remain observable assuming a time
averaging window of tavg=0.1µs. This corresponds to a coupling strength ηe/3three times
the one used in Fig. 5, and we show an example of the related current evolution in App. D.
For stronger poisoning rates, it becomes difficult to distinguish the current signal of the ˜q=0
sector from noise. A clear observation of the three-level telegraph noise relies indeed on both
a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, and on the fact that all charge sectors must be populated
for sufficiently long times with respect to the poisoning time. An exhaustive analysis of the
necessary conditions to observe the three-level telegraph noise is beyond our scope, given
the non-trivial dependence of the system dynamics on all the physical parameters. We can,
however, identify important qualitative features; in general, the signal integration time and the
choice of the bias voltage of the lead are instrumental to achieve a sufficiently large signal-to-
noise ratio, whereas the temperature, FQH edge voltage and FQH gap concur in determining
the poisoning rates and thus the occupation of the different charge sectors.
From our numerical results, we conclude that if the poisoning rate Γe/3is weak compared
to the measurement rate Γ 
Γe/3≲0.02Γ
, the current signal will jump between all three levels
that correspond to the different charge sectors ˜q, given that the voltage is tuned appropriately
(see Fig. 3). On a timescale that is long compared to the poisoning time (and thereby also the
measurement time) the signal will therefore show a three-level telegraph noise behaviour. We
emphasise that this behaviour is a strong signature of PFs unlikely to be confused with trivial
alternatives such as Andreev bound states.
4 Coupling with an antidot
Another source of poisoning could be impurities or electric potential hills trapping fractional
charges in the bulk of the FQH liquid. These are commonly referred to as antidots (see, for
instance, Ref. [44]). We consider a coherent form of quasiparticle poisoning and include one
antidot in a simplified manner as a two-level system [45]described by the operators (a,a†),
fulfilling a2= (a†)2=0. The two levels correspond to two different charges on the antidot,
QadandQad+e/3, split in energy by δad≪ϵ,Γ. This approximation is meant to describe small
antidots with two almost-degenerate states separated in energy from further excited states by
strong interactions. We require the commutation relations aαi=eiπ/3αiaand[αi,Qad] =0,

Based on this definition and the matrix elements 〈q′|α(†)

elements of the total system Hamiltonian are

The jump operators for electrons tunneling to or from the normal lead have to be extended
to take into account the extra degree of freedom from the antidot. Importantly, the current
measurement can still only sense the charge of the PFs and does not change the state of the
antidot. In the new basis, the jump operators are then given by
˜Le

q,qadq
ΓJ±(Ξq,Vb)|q,qad〉〈q+3,qad|. (15)
The dynamics of the PF and antidot system, coupled to the external electrode, still preserves
the total fractional charge mod eof the system. The 12 states in Eq. (13) are therefore split
into three charge sectors, each including four states that, importantly, are characterised by two
different values of the PF charge ˜qdue to the possible leakage of charge into the antidot. As a
result, the new 12 ×12 Hamiltonian and the corresponding jump operators yield current signals
as those exemplified in Fig. 7. They show telegraph noise behaviour, but now only between
two˜qsectors since the antidot can only host charge QadorQad+e/3. For example, the initial
state in Fig. 7(b) is the superposition1p
2(|0, 0〉+|3, 0〉)with charge Qadon the antidot. The
current signal in the ˜q=0 sector is a few pA for the chosen parameters. However, due to
Hpf−ad, the state evolves into a superposition of the states |5, 1〉and|2, 1〉with one e/3 charge
moved to the antidot and thus a current signal around 120 pA emerges. The behaviour is

2(|q=˜q, 1〉+|q=˜q+3, 1〉). The onset of the two-
level telegraph noise is due to the competition between the weak coherent coupling ηad,iwith
the antidot and the stronger incoherent coupling Γwith the normal lead (with ηad,i=0.05Γin
Fig. 7). Increasing the coupling ηad,ithe jumps between current levels become more frequent.
Once one reaches the regime ηad,i≳Γ, the currents for the three initial states used in Fig. 7
instead become stable again like in Fig. 7(a), but at different values. We refer to App. D for
such a plot. The three new levels correspond to the leading transition within each of the three
fractional charge sectors: (˜q+qad)mod 3.
In conclusion, our simulations suggest that, when the coherent coupling with the anti-
dot is weaker than Γ, the current measurement provides a reliable estimate of the PF state,
provided that the readout occurs over sufficiently short timescales. Importantly, even though
2π|ηad,i|−1≲tproj≲tavgfor the parameters adopted in the previous calculations (the projec-
tion time is inferred from the data in Fig. 2(b) around eVb=2.6λ), we find that less than 2%
of the trajectories display jump events between the current levels for times t<2π|ηad,i|−1.
Given our analysis of quasiparticle poisoning and telegraph noise, which are determined
both by the FQH edge and by the coupling with antidots in the bulk, we conclude that the
readout of the state of two PFs through the coupling with an external lead can be performed as
long as|Ξ˜q−Ξ˜q′|>Γ,TandΓ≫Γe/3,|ηad,i|, such that tproj≲Γ−1

we consider the ideal case of readouts fast enough to avoid poisoning of the PF charge.
5 Four-parafermion devices
Most of the properties of non-abelian anyons require systems with more than two of these
quasiparticles to be studied. Therefore we now extend our analysis to four Z6PFs. We consider
a device with two thin SC islands analogous to the previous proposals such that in total, four
PFs{α1, . . . ,α4}become accessible. Additionally, we assume for simplicity that couplings to
antidots and external edges of the FQH system are negligible.
To manipulate the quantum states of a four-PF system, we must consider a device in which
the couplings can, in general, be controlled in time. To this purpose we focus on the device
depicted in Fig. 8, closely related to setups discussed in Refs. [45–47 ]. We present a detailed
discussion of this system in Sec. 5.2. For the moment, we focus on the effective PF model
sketched in the dashed box in the top of Fig. 8. The couplings between α1andα2, and between
α3andα4, are of electrostatic origin. We assume that they are tunable and label them with ϵL
andϵR, respectively. The modes α2andα3are instead coupled with a strength J, modelling
a fractional Josephson interaction [7, 48, 49 ]. Additionally, we consider a global charging
energy interaction ϵLRthat depends on the total charge of the system. The corresponding
four-PF Hamiltonian reads (see Sec. 5.2 for details)

The phasesφLandφRplay a role analogous to φintroduced in Sec. 2. θis instead deter-
mined by the large magnetic field in the device and can be tuned by small variations of this. It
yields a similar effect in determining the energy levels associated with the fractional Josephson
term. Like in the setups analysed in the previous sections, the fusion of α1andα2is charac-
terised by their shared fractional charge which we now label qLfor clarity. Similarly, there
exists an operator qRcounting the number of charges shared by α3andα4. For an isolated
system, the total charge mod 2 eof the four PFs, (qL+qR)e/3≡Qe/3, must be conserved.
13SciPost Physics Submission
Hence, the 36-dimensional Hilbert space of H4pfsplits into six sectors corresponding to differ-
entQe/3=0,e/3, . . . , 5 e/3, each of six states. The eigenstates of H4pfcan thus be labelled by
the total charge and their energy level E(Q)

The Hamiltonian in Eq. (16) corresponds to a two-site quantum clock model where the PF
operators are related to the Z6clock operators τiandσi,i=L,R, by a generalised Jordan-
Wigner transformation [4]:

L. Before analysing the
features of the resulting quantum trajectories, let us consider different limits of the PF cou-
plings. Based on that, we suggest a protocol for experimentally investigating the associativity
of the fusion rules of the PFs and use the quantum jump technique to make predictions for the
related current signatures in Sec. 5.1.
We begin with the limit J≪ϵL,ϵRwhere the two SCs simply act as copies of the origi-
nal two-PF setup with each their charge number conserved. The set {|qL,qR〉}approximates
the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian up to corrections of O(J/minqL(EQ,qL−EQ,qL+1)), where
EQ,qL|Q,qL〉=H4pf(J=0)|Q,qL〉. A current readout with the lead coupled to α2at a strength
Γ≫Jresults in the behaviour reported in Fig. 3(a) with qR"frozen", analogously to the mea-
surement dynamics discussed in Sec. 4: the coupling with the normal lead competes with the
fractional Josephson energy Jthat may cause jumps between current readouts corresponding
to different values of ˜qL. This would manifest itself in a telegraph noise of the current signal
14SciPost Physics Submission
between two or three values depending on the level spacing of the right SC. In special cases
where e.g.φR=−π/6, such that the right SC has degenerate levels for qR=0 and qR=1, the
limit J≪Γ≪ϵL≪ϵRtranslates to the two-PF and antidot case treated in Sec. 4 with respect
to the left SC where Jcorresponds to ηad,i. If instead Γ≪J≪ϵL,ϵR, the tunnelling spec-
troscopy across the normal lead reflects the complex energy spectrum of H4pfand no telegraph
noise is observed.
In the limitϵL,ϵR≪J, the charges qL,qRare not separately conserved and the eigenstates
of the PJoperator,{PJ|Q,j〉=e−iπ
3j|Q,j〉}, approximate the eigenstates of H4pf(again, up to
corrections of O(max(ϵL,ϵR)/minj(EQ,j−EQ,j+1))with EQ,j|Q,j〉=H4pf(ϵL=ϵR=0)|Q,j〉).
The eigenenergies are grouped into six subsets each containing six almost-degenerate levels
with splitting of the order max (ϵL,ϵR), and the situation simplifies to the two-PF case for
ϵL=ϵR=0 withα1andα4isolated. For finite ϵL,ϵR, a current measurement through α2with
ϵL,ϵR≪Γ≪Jis expected to show three-level telegraph noise as in Sec. 3, corresponding to
jumps between different |˜j〉states where ˜jis theZ3part of j, analogously to ˜qi.
Regardless of the limits taken above, the role of ϵLRis to shift the resonance energies
(corresponding to ∆ϵ(˜q)defined in Sec. 2) and thereby also the optimal voltage range for the
readouts discussed above.
5.1 Associativity relations of the anyonic parafermion fusion
The associativity relations of the algebraic fusion rules of a collection of anyons constitute a
crucial element to define their non-abelian character [50, 51 ]. In the following, we present
a protocol to experimentally verify that the PFs in the setup depicted in Fig. 8 are indeed
anyons characterised by non-abelian fusion rules. This corresponds to showing that any pair
of PFs defines a degree of freedom that can assume 6 different values, and that the degrees
of freedom obtained by coupling the same PF with different partners, for instance, α2with
α1andα3, obey specific algebraic rules, and do not depend on the first PF ( α2) alone. In
particular, given the set of four PFs depicted in Fig. 8, the interactions labelled by ϵLandJare
related to the fusion of α2withα1andα3, respectively. The outcomes of these two different
fusion processes are represented by the eigenstates of PLandPJ, respectively, and the related
associativity relations are described by a unitary transformation, usually called the F-matrix,
that maps the eigenstates of PJ,|Q,j〉, into the eigenstates of PL,|Q,qL〉.
As mentioned in Sec. 2, the outcome of the fusion of two Z6PFs (for instance, the eigen-
states of PL) can be characterized by considering a Z2fermionic parity, which is constantly
scrambled by the interaction with the normal lead, and the more robust Z3fractional charge
˜q. This structure is a general mathematical feature, and it holds also for the fusion of the
PFsα2andα3belonging to different SC islands. The Z6fusion algebra is indeed natu-
rally decomposed in these two degrees of freedom. Ref. [5]showed, for instance, that the
braiding operations of Z2mPFs can be decomposed into the tensor product of a 2 ×2 Ma-
jorana braiding matrix with an m×munitary matrix affecting the fractional degree of free-
dom. In the following, we show that also the associativity F-matrix splits into the tensor
product of two associativity matrices for the different sectors. To this end, we introduce the

Here F(2)is recognised as the Majorana F-matrix [50]and relates pLandpJ(the fermionic par-
ity degrees of freedom). F(3)†is aZ3PFF-matrix that relates the fractional degrees of freedom
˜qLand˜j(see App. E for details). We introduce the reduced density matrices ˜ρL=TrpL[ρL]
and ˜ρJ=TrpJ[ρJ]which describe the ˜qLand˜jdegrees of freedom, respectively; they are
obtained by tracing the full density matrices expressed in the eigenbasis of qLandjover the
related parities. As an effect of the decomposition of F(6)into the parity and fractional sectors,
these reduced density matrices are related by
˜ρL=F(3)†˜ρJF(3). (24)
In App. E we derive this relation explicitly.
A current readout allows us, in the different limits discussed above, to measure the frac-
tional charges ˜qLand˜j. Therefore, Eq. (24) implies that, in a series of consecutive fusions,
the probability of measuring the outcome ˜j, conditioned to the fact that the previous mea-
surement returned ˜qL, is given by|F(3)
˜j,˜qL|2. However, the square amplitude of all elements in
F(3)is 1/3, hence any of the |˜qL〉states will lead to an outcome of ˜jthat is 0, 1 or 2 with
the same probability 1 /3. The same holds true the other way around. Similar results were
proposed for Majorana modes in Ref. [53]. The equal probability of all outcomes in these al-
ternating measurements is a strong indication of the non-abelian character of PFs as it derives
from the non-trivial commutation rules between the observables PLandPJ. Such a probability
distribution would be different from measurement outcomes related to most non-topological
degrees of freedom localised in proximity of the lead. For instance, if the PFs in our system
were replaced by a single antidot with a localised fractional charge, the current readout would
always return the same outcome (up to random poisoning events).
The current readout schemes presented in the previous sections can be adopted to exper-
imentally observe the probabilities |F(3)
˜j,˜qJ|2in a way reminiscent of measurement-based topo-
logical quantum computation [54]. To this end, we propose a quantum quench protocol to
first initialise the four-PF system in a state with a well-defined ˜qLand then measure ˜j, thereby
obtaining statistics of the amplitude of the reduced associativity matrix F(3)†. The protocol re-
quires the ratios ϵL/JandϵR/Jto be tunable in order to apply a suitable tunnel spectroscopy
readout of ˜j. In the next subsection, we present a strategy to vary the couplings ϵiover several
orders of magnitude.
We consider the device in Fig. 8, such that a normal metallic lead is connected to α2with a
coupling rate Γ, as described in the previous sections. We assume that the fractional Josephson

through the current across the lead, as discussed in the previous sections. This measurement,
however, is not strictly necessary with a strong ϵini

same mechanism analysed in Sec. 4, and we read out the corresponding current signal. On
average, we expect to measure ˜j=0, 1 and 2 with equal probability 1 /3.
To evaluate this protocol, we use again the quantum jump method and stochastically
evolve the system within a sector with well-defined Qmod 3. We initialise the evolution
in the groundstate of the Hamiltonian H4pf(t<0)and adopt the jump operators defined in
Eq. (21) using the eigenstates of H4pf(t>0). With the same procedure and time interval
(tavg=0.1µs) as for the two-PF scenarios, we calculate the current evolution at a fixed
voltage bias of the lead. Specifically, for H4pf(t<0)we useϵini

The voltage bias is fixed to eVb=2.6λsimilarly to Secs. 3 and 4. In Fig. 10(a) we show a
histogram of the mean value of the current 〈I〉, numerically observed in the interval tmfrom
t=0.1µs tot=2µs (tm=456·2πΓ−1≈23·2π|ϵquench

pA and 250 pA. These values approximately correspond to the mean current of the system
withϵquench
i=0 when initialised in the eigenstates of ˜j;〈I〉˜j=0=4.5 pA,〈I〉˜j=1=237 pA and
〈I〉˜j=2=108 pA (calculated by averaging over 50 µs). In an ideal case where the fractional
Josephson coupling is turned off completely at times t<0 and only acquires a finite value at
t=0, and whereϵquench
i=0, the distribution among the sectors ˜j=0, 1, 2 is indeed equal
with 1/3 probability for each. In the more realistic scenario simulated here, we observe two
different deviations from the ideal result. Firstly, the finite Jatt<0 implies that the initial
groundstate is not a perfectly defined |qL〉eigenstate, and this is the reason for the uneven dis-
tribution among sectors despite the large number of simulations. Secondly, a finite background
of counts appears at intermediate 〈I〉between the three values of 〈I〉˜j. This reflects that jumps
between different |˜j〉states take place in some of the trajectories within the tm=1.9µs that
the current is averaged over, due to the finite ϵquench
i. Indeed, tmis considerably larger than the
scale 2π|ϵquench
i|−1, and the quasiparticle poisoning determined by the coherent ϵquench
iper-
turbations is not negligible (we stress that tm̸=tavg=0.1µs). Despite this, the distribution
in Fig. 10(a) displays three clearly-separated peaks with only a weak background of counts.
In Fig. 10(b) we show an example of the current trajectory over long times compared to
the time interval tm(indicated by the shaded area). Indeed, we see a three-level telegraph
noise just as in the two-PF case of Sec. 3, which typically occurs on timescales longer than tm.
Finally, we note that based on our findings in Sec. 2.2 the projection into one of the ˜jsectors
happens on a timescale much shorter than 0.1 µs, such that the current readout provides clear

Inspired by Refs. [18, 46–48, 55 ], we propose in this section a construction of a four-PF sys-
tem with tunable nearest-neighbour PF coupling, based on transmon technology. Referring
to Fig. 8, each of the two SC islands display a charging energy EC,i,i=L,Ras they are not
directly connected to ground. In addition, they have also a mutual charging energy ECCde-
termined by a cross capacitance. The two SCs are connected through a fractional Josephson
coupling Jmediated by the PFs α2andα3[7, 48, 49 ]. Both islands are also coupled through
an integer Josephson coupling EJ,ito a background grounded SC. We assume that the Joseph-
son couplings EJ,ican be tuned, for example, by using a gate-controlled nanowire junction
(gatemon) [56–58 ]. The related Hamiltonian reads

is the tunable charge induced in the SC iby an external voltage gate and eqi/3 is the charge
of the PF pair in this island. The phase θ=πΦ/3Φ0is proportional to the magnetic flux Φ
threading the superconducting circuit composed by the two SC islands and the background
SC in Fig. 8. It can thus be tuned by small variations of the magnetic field which do not affect
the state of the FQH system. Φ0is the magnetic flux quantum. The fractional Josephson
junction term proportional to Jincludes operators e±iϑiδqi,0that account for the creation and
annihilation of a Cooper pair resulting from the tunnelling of a charge e/3 when the PFs
in island ishare, respectively, the state qi=5 or qi=0 (see Refs. [59, 60 ]for analogous
constructions with Majorana modes).

By generalising the Majorana calculation in Refs. [55, 60 ]we obtain that, in the trans-
mon regime EJ,i≫EC,i, the low-energy dynamics of the system can be approximated by the
semiclassical effective Hamiltonian in Eq. (16) with the following parameters:

=EC.ϵiis calculated based on the 2 πphase slip of island iand neglecting the ECCpairing.
More refined results can be found in Ref. [55]. The termϵLR, instead, accounts for the simul-
taneous phase slip by 2 πof both the islands estimated by imposing the freezing of the phase
differenceϑL−ϑR=0, and it becomes sizeable for devices with large ECC. The phasesφiin
Eqs. (16) and (18) are proportional to the charges induced in the two SC islands and can in
principle be controlled through suitable voltage gates. All the previous estimates have been
derived by neglecting the fractional Josephson term J≪EJ. Importantly, this semiclassical
analysis shows that the couplings ϵiin Eq. (26) can be exponentially varied by changing the
ratio EJ,i/EC,i, as common in transmon devices.
To estimate realistic bounds for the variation of the couplings ϵiwe observe that the Joseph-
son energies reported for SC-semiconductor hybrids in Ref. [56]can reach 1 THz, and we con-
sider charging energies around 0.1 meV ≈24 GHz [61]for aluminium islands of similar width
as the SC electrodes in Refs. [1, 2]. This yields a maximal ratio in the exponent of Eq. (26)
around EJ/EC≈40 which guarantees the possibility of decreasing the parameters ϵito negli-
gible values by tuning the Josephson energies in Eq. (26). Specifically, the PF couplings ϵican
be reduced by many orders of magnitude from their maximal values of the order of ECby using
voltage gates to pinch off or open the Josephson junctions as in gatemon devices [56]. This
justifies the conservative ratios ϵquench
i/ϵini
i≈10−4adopted to derive the data in Fig. 10(a).
Alternative four-PF devices with tunable couplings can be used for similar quench and
readout protocols such as, for instance, PFs embedded in fluxonium circuits [49]. Furthermore,
systems with a tunable coupling rate Γbetween the lead and the PFs could be exploited to
perform more efficient measurement protocols for the associativity rules and to extend the
validity of our analysis to a broader range of parameters.
6 Discussion and conclusions
We have analysed the transport signatures of Z6PFs in hybrid FQH-SC devices coupled to a
normal electrode and demonstrated that current readouts can reveal the fractional character
of these modes in suitable ranges of parameters. Differently from previous works focusing on
the transport of fractional charges [45, 48, 62–66 ], all the measurements proposed here rely
on the tunnelling spectroscopy of PF systems mediated by electrons. Our analysis is based on a
quantum jump approach to simulate single stochastic trajectories; it shows that current signals
can distinguish the different values of the fractional charge shared by two PFs under realistic
conditions, thus providing a readout method alternative to interferometric techniques [17,45 ].
The quantum jump simulations allowed us to derive how the current measurements become
projective measurements of the parafermionic degree of freedom, to estimate the time required
for this readout and to investigate the related noise.
We extended the jump operator formalism to describe also the incoherent coupling with a
bath of fractional charges. In particular, this enabled us to model the fractional quasiparticle
poisoning caused by the interaction of the PFs with the external edge modes of the FQH system,
19SciPost Physics Submission
modelled as a chiral Luttinger liquid. As a result, we confirmed the onset of an expected
three-level telegraph noise [11]of the current for weak poisoning rates reflecting the jumps
of fractional charges to and from the PF system over time. A telegraph current noise signal
could also be observed when coherently coupling the pair of PFs to an antidot. For small
antidots the result is a two-level noise signal. Inspired by Ref. [45], we remark that a deliberate
construction of an antidot in the FQH platform (as demonstrated in Ref. [12]) can be used to
extend the results and protocols presented in Secs. 4 and 5 to detect further signatures of PFs
and manipulate them. For example, devices with tunable antidot energy levels ( δadin our
model) could be used to dynamically control the transitions between the charge states of the
PFs; the related manipulation protocols would be similar to the ones proposed to observe a
topological blockade effect in non-abelian FQH states [67], or to evolve the states of Majorana
modes through their coupling with quantum dots [68–70 ]. Moreover, additional transport
signatures of the presence of PFs based on the devices presented in Sec. 4 can be offered by
the comparison of antidots of different sizes: the two-level telegraph noise behaviour of the
current for weak PF-antidot coupling would evolve into the three-level noise when enlarging
the antidot, thus lowering its energy splittings and involving more charge states in the system
dynamics.
To study the anyonic properties of parafermionic modes, we expanded the analysis to de-
vices with four PFs. We proposed a quench protocol to test the associativity rules of the fusion
ofZ6PFs and, using again the quantum jump method, we obtained statistics on the ampli-
tude of the F-matrix corresponding to their fractional Z3degree of freedom. Our protocol is
based on the possibility of tuning some of the couplings between the PFs, and we presented
a physical device based on transmon-like elements to achieve the required control over these
interactions.
In general, our simulations are suitable to study also more general noise effects, relevant
for experimental implications, including the consequences of drifting parameters such as the
magnetic flux.
Our results provide indications for the design of hybrid FQH-SC platforms aimed at detect-
ing PFs and studying some of their anyonic features. Furthermore, the readout schemes we
analysed can be integrated in more complex setups to implement their braiding [16,17 ]thus
offering additional tools for their study.

We summarise here the parameters used in this work and briefly explain the respective as-
sumed values.

an expected value for the PF coupling ϵ.
ϵ– Coupling strength between two PFs in the device with a grounded SC. Expected range:

B The quantum jump method
Here we describe the quantum jump method, including the Monte Carlo technique, used to
calculate trajectories and the quantities derived from these.
The total time of the simulation is divided into small time steps δtsuch thatδt≪2πΓ−1.
Within each interval the probability that an electron enters or leaves the PF system through
the metallic lead is thus much smaller than 1. As stated in the main text, the coupling rate is
taken to be Γ=2π·0.24 GHz and we therefore use δt=0.1 ns. With the Hamiltonian H2pf
in Eq. (1) and the jump operators in Eq. (2) we define the no-jump evolution operator
U=exp
−iδt

s=± 

. (29)
We need this to calculate the trajectories for which the protocol is:
Step 0: The state is initialised in a superposition of charge eigenstates |ψ(t=0)〉=P
qcq|q〉
with coefficients cqthat may all be non-zero.
Step 1: The no-jump evolution operator in Eq. (29) is applied to the state |ψ(t)〉with sub-
sequent renormalisation due to the non-unitarity of U. The renormalised state is labelled
|ψ(t+δt)〉.
Step 2: We draw two random numbers from a uniform distribution, ps=±∈[0, 1], and we
furthermore randomly order Le
+andLe
−.
Step 3: We calculate the jump probabilities Ps(t+δt) =〈ψ(t+δt)|(Le
s)†Le
s|ψ(t+δt)〉δt.
By the order set in step 2, we first check if ps′<Ps′(t+δt)where s′is the sign set by the
random ordering. If this is the case, we apply the corresponding jump operator Le
s′to the
state|ψ(t+δt)〉and renormalise. If not, we check the probability of a jump in the opposite
direction (−s′) and if p−s′<P−s′(t+δt)we apply the jump operator Le
−s′with subsequent
renormalisation. In case neither of the conditions are fulfilled, we keep the state |ψ(t+δt)〉.
The protocol is repeated from step 1 with the state obtained in step 3 until the final simulation
time is reached. The assumption of Markovianity of the electron bath means that the distribu-
tion function of the lead is not changed by a jump, but remains the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac
function.
We note that this approach is distinct from the stochastic Schrödinger equation [15]in
the way that the randomly applied jump operators yield an immediate, discontinuous state
transition from|ψ(t+δt)〉toLe
±|ψ(t+δt)〉whereas in the stochastic Schrödinger equation,
the jump operators act as weak projections yielding a continuous state transition.
At every time step of the trajectories we can calculate the expectation value of the charge
〈ψ(t)|q|ψ(t)〉as well as the participation ratio ζintroduced in Eq. (4). Furthermore, by
keeping count of the times that the jump operators are applied, we can also estimate the
current. We introduce the number jdiff(t)which is 0 at t=0 and increases by one whenever
Le
+is applied to the state and decreases by one if Le
−is applied. The current in the lead is
simply obtained by I(t) =|e|(jdiff(t)−jdiff(t−tavg))/tavgwhere tavgis an integration time
which we set to tavg=0.1µs. This is how Fig. 3(a) has been obtained.
23SciPost Physics Submission
In the system analysed in Sec. 3, the coupling with the edge modes is introduced through
the use of the two additional jump operators Le/3
±in Eq. (10). In this case, we apply the same
approach described by the steps 0-3, with a randomised ordering of all four jump operators in
steps 2 and 3.
To give a rough estimate of the ˜qprojection time discussed in Sec. 2.2, we analyse the
continuous part of the wave function evolution and consider in particular the part of Uthat
contains the product of jump operators Le
±. This term in the exponent is diagonal with elements

at the (q,q)entry and thus leads to a decay which partly compensates for the fact that the jump
operators themselves, when applied in step 3, project with different weights into the different
states|q〉. The operator Uallows us to determine the projection time for the special trajectory
in which no jumps occur by comparing the decay rates ˜λ(q)of all the charge eigenstates. The
two states with the lowest ˜λ(q)are|q=0〉and|q=5〉; hence, in the absence of jumps, the

Eq. (31) provides a qualitative indication of the behaviour of the projection time as a function
of the voltage bias and temperature which, as expected, is proportional to Γ−1. In Fig. 11(a)
we compare the trend for a no-jump evolution with the data obtained for stochastic trajectories
by superimposing the function (˜λ(5)−˜λ(0))−1, scaled by a numerical factor 1.45 ·10−3, on
the data of Fig. 2(b). Indeed there is a qualitative agreement between this estimate and the
inferred projection time from the 〈˜q〉andζmeasures at voltages |eVb|≲|Ξq|. The discrepancy
at larger energies is due to fact that this estimate disregards the actual quantum jumps which
dephase the state. As mentioned in the main text the state |equal〉is a worst case example
for the projection time since it includes all six charge eigenstates which have competing decay
rates. The projection of the simpler initial state1p
3(|q=0〉+|q=1〉+|q=2〉)into one of
the charge sectors is faster which we see already on the short O(2πΓ−1)timescale (compare
Fig. 11(b) with Fig. 2(a)).
C Fractional jump operators and anyonic distribution function
We derived the modelling of fractional quasiparticle poisoning in Sec. 3 from the effective
tunnelling of fractional charges between the quantum Hall edge and the PFs given by Hc,edge
in Eq. (8). To model this coupling, we introduced the FQH edge operator associated with the
ideal Laughlin edge modes:

The operatorψe/3annihilates a charge e/3 at an arbitrary position x=0 of the FQH edge, and
it is expressed as the vertex operator of a suitable chiral bosonic field ϕr(x)[71]. Assuming
that the coupling with the PFs is sufficiently weak, such that it does not affect the edge mode

Experimental observations of the heat flow of FQH edge modes in GaAs suggest consid-

such that we treat them as a Markovian bath. By following Ref. [27]we can thereby define

Pilo[39]and by redefining d(E,µ) =β˜d(E,µ)we derive Eq. (9). The explicit expression
for Eq. (34) depends on the specific choice of the PF charge eigenstates |q〉. We adopt the
convention|q〉= (α†
1)q|q=0〉. In this case, the inner products appearing in Eq. (34) read
〈q|α2|q′〉=eiπ/6eiπ(q′−1)/3δq,q′−1, (36)
〈q|α†
2|q′〉=e−iπ/6e−iπq′/3δq,q′+1, (37)
and, replacing these expressions in Eq. (34), we obtain Eq. (10). The Eqs. (36) and (37) are
also used to obtain the matrix elements in Eq. (14).
The anyonic distribution function d(E,µ)for particles with charge e/3 displays, at finite
temperature, the typical behaviour depicted in Fig. 12. It is characterized by a peak in E=µ,
which diverges as ∆−1/3
FQH(µ−E)−2/3Θ(µ−E)in the zero-temperature limit β→∞ . This
divergence is analogous to the divergence of the Bose-Einstein distribution for bosonic con-
densates. Eq. (10) allows us to examine the impact of this divergence on the quasiparticle

Eq. (38) indicates that the zero-temperature resonances can be avoided by tuning the system
to sufficiently large δµ. Specifically, the data presented in Fig. 5 are calculated by consider-
ing a typical FQH gap of graphene ∆FQH=1.7 meV [42],Γ=λ/10 andηe/3=3.5·10−3λwith

At finite temperatures, however, the resonances simply correspond to peaks of d(E,µ)as
in Fig. 12 and their effect is thus limited. In particular, by considering an explicit resonant

For the previous choice of the physical parameters, this corresponds to T≫0.04 mK which is
fulfilled by more than two orders of magnitude in realistic experimental conditions ( T≳10
mK).
The scaling exponent of ∆FQHβin Eqs. (9) and (33) can deviate from 1 /3 if non-universal
effects, such as interactions among different edge modes, drive the system away from the
ideal Laughlin case (see, for instance, the analysis related to quantum point contacts in Refs.
[73–75 ]). We observe, however, that even changing considerably the related exponents in the
previous expression away from β1−ν∆−ν
FQH, the inequality (39) is always fulfilled for realistic
experimental temperatures. Thus, interaction effects in the edge modes will simply result in a
weak renormalisation of dthat does not yield important consequences in the current readout
of the PFs.

D Strong environment coupling
This appendix provides additional figures presenting current signatures where the coupling
between the PFs and the environment is stronger than in the figures of the main text, both for
the incoherent coupling with edge modes and for the coherent coupling with an antidot.
In Fig. 13(a) we show the current trajectory for the system described in Sec. 3 with the
same parameters as in the main text except from the coupling strength to the fractional edge
modesηe/3which is increased by a factor of 3 such that Γe/3≈0.02Γ. At this coupling rate,
the˜q=0 sector is occupied for periods so short, compared to the integration time, that it
becomes problematic to distinguish this current signal from noise.
In Fig. 13(b) current trajectories are shown for the three initial states1p
2(|0, 0〉+|3, 0〉)
(blue),1p
2(|1, 0〉+|4, 0〉)(orange) and1p
2(|2, 0〉+|5, 0〉)(green) where the coupling strengths
between the PFs and the antidot are ηad,1=ηad,2=10Γ. Apart from this, all parameters
are the same as in Fig. 7. The three levels of the current correspond to the most dominant
transition within each of the sectors with conserved total fractional charge: (˜q+qad)mod 3.
E Details on the F-matrix
The permutation Uintroduced in Sec. 5.1 swaps the states |qL=1〉=|pL=1,˜qL=1〉and
|qL=4〉=|pL=0,˜qL=1〉and likewise in the |j〉basis. It reads
U=
1
0 1
1
1
1 0
1
. (40)
Thus, it reorders from the basis {|qL〉}={|0〉,|1〉,|2〉,|3〉,|4〉,|5〉}to the ordering
{|pL,˜qL〉}={|0, 0〉,|0, 1〉|0, 2〉,|1, 0〉,|1, 1〉,|1, 2〉}and likewise for the |j〉and|pJ,˜j〉states.

Since the current measurements detect only the fractional part of the PF state, we need to
trace out the fermionic degree of freedom, pJorpL, to obtain a 3×3 reduced density matrix as
a function of the fractional charge ˜jor˜qLonly. In the following, we show that is it possible to
define a reduced 3 ×3 matrix Fredsuch that ˜ρL=Fred˜ρJF†
redand that Fred=F(3)†, as assumed
in the main text. Based on the definition of the matrix F(6)in Eq. (22), this would correspond
to
X
pL=0,1〈pL|F(6)ρJF(6)†|pL〉=Fred 
X
pJ=0,1〈pJ|ρJ|pJ〉!
F†
red. (41)
To demonstrate that this relation indeed matches Eq. (24), we explicitly write out the reduced
density matrix related to ˜qL,˜ρL, which is obtained by tracing the full density matrix of the
four-PF system over pL:
˜ρL=TrpL[ρL] =TrpL
U 
F(2)⊗F(3)†
U†ρJU 
F(2)†⊗F(3)
U†
=F(3)†X
pL〈pL| 
F(2)⊗1
U†ρJU 
F(2)†⊗1
|pL〉
F(3)
=F(3)†X
pJ〈pJ|U†ρJU|pJ〉
F(3)=F(3)†˜ρJF(3). (42)
In the second line, we have used that the trace over pLis independent of the cyclic permutation
of U (which only interchanges states with the same ˜qL) and that U†=U−1. Furthermore, we
adopt the convention that ρJandρLare expressed in the |j〉and|qL〉bases, respectively,
whereas the explicit summation over pLis done with the states ordered in the |pL,˜qL〉basis.
F(3)is not affected by the reordering of the pLdegrees of freedom within the ˜qL=1 sector (by
the permutation U), and it can be moved out of the partial trace on both sides. In the third
line, we have used F(2)to transform from the |pJ〉to|pL〉basis and are left with the reduced
density matrix ˜ρJin the basis{|˜j〉}={|0〉,|1〉,|2〉}. The above equation confirms that F(3)†is
the associativity mapping between the reduced degrees of freedom ˜qLand˜j.
