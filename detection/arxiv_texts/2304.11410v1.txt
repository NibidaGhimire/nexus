Abstract
The principle of DEPENDENCY LENGTH MINIMIZATION ,
which seeks to keep syntactically related words close in a sen-
tence, is thought to universally shape the structure of human
languages for effective communication. However, the extent
to which dependency length minimization is applied in human
language systems is not yet fully understood. Preverbally, the
placement of long-before-short constituents and postverbally,
short-before-long constituents are known to minimize overall
dependency length of a sentence. In this study, we test the
hypothesis that placing only the shortest preverbal constituent
next to the main-verb explains word order preferences in Hindi
(a SOV language) as opposed to the global minimization of
dependency length. We characterize this approach as a least-
effort strategy because it is a cost-effective way to shorten all
dependencies between the verb and its preverbal dependen-
cies. As such, this approach is consistent with the bounded-
rationality perspective according to which decision making is
governed by ‘fast but frugal’ heuristics rather than by a search
for optimal solutions. Consistent with this idea, our results in-
dicate that actual corpus sentences in the Hindi-Urdu Treebank
corpus are better explained by the least effort strategy than by
global minimization of dependency lengths. Additionally, for
the task of distinguishing corpus sentences from counterfactual
variants, we ﬁnd that the dependency length and constituent
length of the constituent closest to the main verb are much
better predictors of whether a sentence appeared in the cor-
pus than total dependency length. Overall, our ﬁndings sug-
gest that cognitive resource constraints play a crucial role in
shaping natural languages.

Introduction
Human working memory is viewed as a limited capacity sys-
tem, where there is pressure to minimize the cognitive load
by not retaining information longer than necessary. Simon
(1982, 1990, 1991) proposed the idea of bounded ratio-
nality in decision making which incorporates the aforemen-
tioned cognitive limitation and proposed that human’s abil-
ity to make rational decisions has adapted to making choices
that are satisfactory rather than optimal. In language, speak-
ers’ decisions are inﬂuenced by the context in which the
decision is made— availability of information, cognitive re-
sources, and the limited response time . This tension naturally
exerts a challenge for speakers and constrains them to adopt
certain strategies to formulate sentences that are most efﬁ-
cient for communication. For example, choosing word-order
patterns that are most common in daily discourse or placing
the words/phrases early in the sentence that are more accessi-
ble or salient in working memory. In this work, we examinewhether word order variation in Hindi can be seen as a re-
sult of the pressures for efﬁcient communication within the
constraints of bounded rationality.
Prior work has investigated the role of phrase length on
the constituent ordering of sentences (Bock & Warren, 1985;
Arnold, Wasow, Losongco, & Ginstrom, 2000; Hawkins,
1994; Yamashita & Chang, 2001; Choi, 2007; Faghiri &
Samvelian, 2020). The ﬁndings suggest that SVO languages
(e.g., English) have a preference for short-before-long lin-
guistic structure such that shorter phrases are more acces-
sible and get realized before relatively less accessible or
longer ones (Arnold et al., 2000). In contrast, for SOV lan-
guages (e.g., Japanese), long-before-short ordering is preva-
lent, i.e.,longer phrases tend to be shifted ahead of shorter
ones with a view that long phrases are semantically rich
and conceptually salient, and thus realized before than the
shorter ones (Yamashita & Chang, 2001). In this vein, Gib-
son’s Dependency Locality Theory provides a uniﬁed ex-
planation for constituent ordering patterns in both SOV and
SVO languages (Gibson, 2000). The theory prefers con-
stituent order that minimizes the overall dependency length
of the sentence irrespective of language. Preverbally, long-
before-short and postverbally, short-before-long constituent
ordering minimize the overall dependency length in the sen-
tence (Hawkins, 2004).
The principle of DEPENDENCY LENGTH MINIMIZATION
(DLM), is believed to reduce the cognitive load on work-
ing memory by reducing the distance between syntactically
related words in the sentence for both speakers and hear-
ers (Gibson, 1991; Hudson, 1995; Gibson, 1998, 2000;
Ferrer-i-Cancho, 2004; Temperley, 2007). This has been
shown to be the case in natural languages, which tend to
have shorter overall dependency lengths than those produced
randomly (Futrell, Mahowald, & Gibson, 2015; Liu, Xu, &
Liang, 2017; Temperley & Gildea, 2018; Futrell, Levy, &
Gibson, 2020). The DLM hypothesis has therefore been
demonstrated to be an essential characteristic of efﬁcient
word order by virtue of communicative efﬁciency in human
language (Gibson et al., 2019). However, the extent to which
the minimization of dependency length is applied to human
language systems in not yet fully understood. This serves
as our primary motivation, for which we apply the idea of
bounded rationality to DLM and investigate how well it ex-
plains word-order preferences in Hindi.arXiv:2304.11410v1  [cs.CL]  22 Apr 2023(1) a. maa=ne

Hindi, a Indo-Aryan language from the Indo-European lan-
guage family, has subject-object-verb ( SOV) as the basic word
order and has a rich case-marking system (Kachru, 1982). In
contrast to English, Hindi exhibits greater ﬂexibility in the
arrangement of words within a sentence, as illustrated in Ex-
ample 1. Example 1a has 4 preverbal constituents and is con-
sidered the most preferred syntactic choice since it originally
appeared in the corpus as opposed to all variants (4! = 24)
that are possible with this sentence.
In this work, we test our hypothesis that speakers adopt
a least-effort strategy to determine the word order choices
in Hindi as opposed to global minimization of dependency
length. We deﬁne least-effort strategy as the placement of
shortest preverbal constituent closest to the main verb as this
is the most economical way of reducing all the dependencies
between the verb and its preverbal dependents (see Figure
3 for an illustration). We generated different counterfactual
variants by randomly rearranging their preverbal constituents
(see Examples 1b-1c to list a few) for each reference sentence
(1a) in Hindi-Urdu Treebank corpus of written text. Next, we
conducted a quantitative analysis of those variants and their
corresponding corpus reference sentences. We then deployed
a logistic regression classiﬁer to distinguish the corpus ref-
erence sentence from the artiﬁcially generated variants based
on the dependency length and constituent length of prever-
bal constituents, and overall dependency length of the sen-
tence. The primary motivation behind choosing constituent-
level predictors was to test the efﬁcacy of the least-effort strat-
egy (see Figure 3d) against global minimization constraint
(see Figure 3b) under the purview of bounded rationality. As
the number of preverbal constituents increases (say from 3
!5), the number of possible variants also increases signiﬁ-
cantly (3! = 6!5! = 120); overburdening the speakers to
make choices. A boundedly rational speaker would then ap-
ply a heuristic strategy that identiﬁes a satisfactory solution
that does not necessarily minimize total dependency length
(Newell & Simon, 1972; Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011).
Our main contribution through this work is that we show
the impact of dependency length minimization on word or-
der choices in Hindi using large-scale naturalistic data rather
than the constructed experimental stimuli and offer cross-
linguistic evidence essential for the advancement of cognitive
theories (Jaeger & Norcliffe, 2009).
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We
ﬁrst brieﬂy describe the data and methods used to investigate
the hypothesis, followed by the results in this work. Towards
the end, we discuss the broader implications of our ﬁndings
with a conclusion and future directions.Method
Our data set consists of 7,586 declarative sentences from the
Hindi-Urdu Treebank (HUTB) corpus of written text belong-
ing to the newswire domain (Bhatt et al., 2009). For each ref-
erence sentence in the corpus, we created artiﬁcial variants by
randomly permuting the preverbal constituents whose head
was immediate child to the root verb in their projective depen-
dency tree (see Figure 3). In instances where there were more
than 100 variants (an arbitrary cutoff1to keep our computa-
tion tractable), we randomly selected 99 of them. Our variant
generation approach resulted in 184818 competing variants in
total, for the reference sentences in our dataset. Refer to Ex-
ample 1 for an illustration. Figure 1 depicts the percentages
of reference-variant sentences for each number of preverbal
constituents. Due to insufﬁcient data points for sentences
with 7 or more preverbal constituents, we only present the
corpus analysis results for sentences with up to 6 preverbal
phrases. However, for the binary classiﬁcation task presented
in the later section of this work, we used the entire dataset to
compute our results2.
Corpus analysis
Previous corpus studies in Hindi have revealed a predomi-
nance of long-before-short constituent orders preverbally, and
smaller head-dependent distances (Sharma, Futrell, & Hu-
sain, 2020; Ranjan, Rajkumar, & Agarwal, 2022). To test
our hypothesis of least-effort strategy, we investigated the
role of all preverbal constituents in minimizing the overall
dependency length of the sentence. Consistent with previous
studies, we also found that long-before-short constituent or-
ders are dominant in Hindi (Ranjan et al., 2022). In addition,
we also observed a wide distribution of long-before-short and
short-before-long constituents in corpus sentences with vary-
ing preverbal constituents (see Figure 2). Crucially, the plot
in Figure 2 suggests the constituent closest to the main verb
has a strong tendency to be the shortest among all the pre-
verbal constituents in the sentence. This is consistent with
the predictions of the least effort principle, because moving
the shortest constituent to the main verb minimizes not just
that constituent’s dependency length but also the dependency
lengths of all other preverbal dependents of the main verb,
therefore striking a favorable cost-beneﬁt ratio.
Interestingly, Figure 2 also shows that the pressure to move
shorter constituent to the main verb increases with the num-
ber of preverbal constituents, thus suggesting that speakers
may dynamically balance production cost and comprehen-
ders’ cognitive constraints.3To further test support the idea
that speakers adopt a least-effort strategy (i.e. place short-
est constituent next to the main verb), we compared the to-
tal dependency length of reference sentences (attested in the

variants and found that our ﬁndings were consistent with those re-
ported below.

corpus) to four alternatives with different constituent orders
illustrated in Figure 3 for example sentence 1a:
1. A SCENDING ORDER : Arrange the preverbal constituents in their
increasing order of constituent lengths. This arrangement leads
to maximal dependency length of the sentence (See Figure 3a).
2. D ESCENDING ORDER : Arrange the preverbal constituents in
their decreasing order of constituent lengths. This arrangement
globally minimizes the dependency length of the sentence (See
Figure 3b).
3. R ANDOM ORDER : Arrange the preverbal constituents randomly
(See Figure 3c).
4. L EAST -EFFORT ORDER : Start with a random order of preverbal
constituents and then simply move the shortest constituent next
to the main verb (See Figure 3d).
Our results in Figure 4 show that the dependency length
of sentences in the corpus generally tracks the dependency
length of the least-effort solution for sentences with three or
more preverbal constituents. Only sentences with two prever-
bal constituents deviate from the least-effort order. This may
be because the memory pressure is so low in these cases that
the system does not optimize dependency length at all, not
even with the least effort heuristic. Consistent with previousstudies, the plot also conﬁrms that corpus reference sentences
on average have lower dependency length than the sentences
with random word orders (Liu, 2008; Gildea & Temperley,
2010; Futrell et al., 2015, 2020).
These results further corroborate the idea that dependency
length minimization in Hindi, and thus constituent order, are
governed by a least-effort strategy. This is consistent with
the bounded rationality view of decision making, based on
which we would expect that speakers consider only a limited
search space when planning sentences (Gigerenzer, Hertwig,
& Pachur, 2011).
In the next section, we further test and validate the least-
effort hypothesis using a decision task with a goal to distin-
guish reference sentences from random variants (Gildea &
Temperley, 2010; Temperley & Gildea, 2018).
Computational simulation
We set up a binary classiﬁcation task to distinguish the ref-
erence sentence amidst the artiﬁcially generated variants.
Our original dataset had a signiﬁcant class imbalance, with
184818 variants compared to only 7586 reference sentences.
To address this imbalance, we applied the technique sug-
gested by Joachims (2002) which transforms the task of clas-
sifying a sentence as either reference or variant into a task of
ranking reference sentence against each of its variants (pair-
wise ranking) by training the classiﬁer on the difference be-
tween the feature vectors of variant sentence and correspond-
ing paired reference sentence (see Equations 1 and 2).
wf(re f erence )>wf(variant ) (1)
w(f(re f erence ) f(variant ))>0 (2)
Equation 1 represents the objective of a standard binary
classiﬁer where corpus reference sentence is preferred against
its corresponding variant sentence. The classiﬁer must deter-
mine a feature weight ( w) such that the dot product of wand
the reference feature vector ( f(re f erence )) is greater than the
dot product of wand the variant feature vector ( f(variant )).
This objective can be rephrased as Equation 2 where the dottoffee maa nebaajaar jaate samaye rote hue bacche ko di

product of wand the difference between the feature vectors
must be greater than zero. The dataset was structured such
that each variant sentence was paired with its corresponding
reference sentence, with the order being balanced across these
pairs. For instance, Example 1 would give (1a-1b) and (1c-
1a). Feature vectors were subtracted and binary labels were
assigned to each transformed data point. The “Reference-
Variant” pairs were labeled as “1” and “Variant-Reference”
pairs were labeled as “0”, thus balancing the previously im-
balanced classiﬁcation task. Post Joachims’s transformation,
we had in total 184818 data points for our classiﬁcation task.
See Ranjan et al. (2022) for more details.
We used the glm function in R to test the stated hy-
pothesis at the outset (dependent variable independent
variables): choiceddependency length and choice
dconstituent length . Here, choice is a binary choice de-
pendent variable (1 stands for reference sentence preference,
and 0 denotes the variant sentence preference). The delta ( d)
refers to the difference between the feature vectors of refer-
ence sentence and its paired variant. The classiﬁer predicts la-
bel “1” if corpus reference sentence outranks a variant paired
with it and “0” if variant outranks its paired reference sen-
tence. All the independent variables were normalised to z-
scores, i.e., the predictor’s value (centered around its mean)
was divided by its standard deviation. We estimated indepen-dent variables as below (also see Figure 3 for illustration):
1.TOTAL DEPENDENCY LENGTH : Summation of head-dependent
distances in a dependency tree of a sentence. And the head-
dependent distance was estimated by counting the number of in-
tervening words between them.
2.CONSTITUENT DEPENDENCY LENGTH : Number of words
spanned between the head of the preverbal constituent and the
main root on which the constituent is dependent.
3.CONSTITUENT LENGTH : Total word counts in the constituent.
Regression analysis
In this section, we test our main hypothesis that speakers op-
timize word order choices in Hindi by adopting least-effort
strategy (i.e., shifting the shortest constituent closest to the
main verb) under the constraints of dependency length min-
imization. Figure 1b depicts the distribution of variants
with varying preverbal constituents. Since our classiﬁca-
tion dataset is dominated by reference-variant pairs with 5
preverbal constituents, we test the least-effort hypothesis on
the transformed version of our dataset with 5 preverbal con-
stituents only (87143 data points) using a logistic regression
model. We estimated the dependency length and constituent
length of all 5 preverbal constituents and introduced them as
predictors in our regression models ( choicedconst 1+
dconst 2+dconst 3+dconst 4+dconst 5). However, before123

doing so, we ﬁrst deployed the Recursive Feature Elimina-
tion Cross-validation algorithm (Guyon, Weston, Barnhill, &
Vapnik, 2002, RFECV) to ﬁnd the best predictors among ﬁve
preverbal constituents and then reported the regression results
using the obtained optimal features.
Tables 1 and 2 display the results of our regression analy-
sis. Negative regression coefﬁcients in Tables 1 and 2 suggest
that reference sentences tend to have lower constituent-level
dependency length and the length of constituent, respectively,
than their paired variant. The larger magnitude of the regres-
sion coefﬁcient of the last two preverbal constituents closest
to the verb ( const 4 & const 5) as opposed to other prever-
bal constituents in the model suggests their greater role in
minimizing overall dependency length of reference sentence
than the paired variants. Notably, our results were consistent
across reference-variant sentences with 2 to 6 preverbal con-
stituents, indicating that our ﬁndings are not limited to rare
constructions, but are applicable to frequent ones as well in
the Hindi natural corpus. In sum, these ﬁndings suggest that
speakers indeed, apply the least-effort strategy to optimize for
word orders such that the preverbal constituents closest to the
verb are shorter and also have lower dependency length.
Classiﬁcation analysis
Based on the insights from the previous section, we de-
ployed the last two preverbal constituent’s dependency
length and constituent length (closest to the main verb:
2nd last &last constituents ) as predictors into the classiﬁ-
cation model aimed at predicting reference sentences amidst
the counterfactual variants. We make use of our entire dataset
(184818 reference-variant pairs) and conduct 10-fold cross-Predictor Estimate Std-Error z-value

the referent sentence over a paired variant. Tables 3 and 4
present the prediction performance of our models. As illus-
trated in Table 3, in terms of individual classiﬁcation accu-
racy, the dependency length of the last constituent turned out
to be the best predictor (72.70%), thus validating the efﬁcacy
of the proposed least-effort principle. Interestingly, this mea-
sure supersedes the performance of the overall dependency
length measure (62.69%) of the sentence as well.
Over a baseline model containing the last constituent’s de-
pendency length, adding the 2nd last constituent’s depen-
dency length induced a signiﬁcant increase of 4.47% in the
classiﬁcation accuracy (p <0.001 using McNemar’s two-
tailed test). We ﬁnd similar results when the constituent
lengths of the last two constituents were deployed as predic-
tors in the classiﬁer, as shown in Table 4. These ﬁndings lend
credence to the idea that speakers adopt least-effort strategy,Predictor Estimate Std-Error z-value

Discussion and conclusion
Our main ﬁndings demonstrate that speakers in Hindi choose
optimal word orders by placing the shortest phrase closest
to the main verb, consistent with the central ideas of the
bounded rationality view of decision making. This least ef-
fort approach not only reduces the overall dependency length
but also enables a selective search procedure in a vast search
space where ﬁnding the optimal solution is difﬁcult. There-
fore the sentence planning system uses a simple yet powerful
heuristic. Additionally, as depicted in Figure 2, the pressure
to shorten the constituent closest to the main verb increases
as the length of the sentence increases. We also observed
that sentences that originally appeared in the corpus had de-
pendency lengths distribution similar to the proposed least-
effort solution evincing the efﬁcacy of bounded rationality in
choosing the appropriate word order in Hindi (See Figure 4).
In addition, the HUTB corpus sentences had lower overall de-
pendency length than the random word orders consistent with
the earlier studies (Liu, 2008; Futrell et al., 2015, 2020).
The prediction performance of two distinct classiﬁcation
models aimed at distinguishing reference sentences amidst ar-
tiﬁcially generated variants using just the constituent lengths
(70.28%) and just the dependency lengths of the last two pre-
verbal constituents that are nearest to the main verb (77.17%)
emphasizes the signiﬁcance of the proposed least-effort strat-
egy in shaping the constituent order (Liu et al., 2017; Tem-
perley & Gildea, 2018; Futrell et al., 2020). It’s also interest-
ing to note that the overall dependency length (62.69%) per-
forms poorly in predicting corpus reference sentences (amidstPredictor(s) Accuracy

variants) than the least-effort strategy (last preverbal con-
stituent’s dependency length = 72.70%; last preverbal con-
stituent length = 69.62%). As a part of future work, we plan
to examine the effectiveness of our proposed least-effort mea-
sure across various languages from different language fam-
ilies. Studying how languages may differ in the way they
implement bounded rationality strategies can provide further
insight into the relationship between language and cognition.
The broader implication of our work is that word order
choices can be seen as a result of the pressures for efﬁcient
communication within the constraints of bounded rational-
ity (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996; Gigerenzer, 2015). The
speaker’s attempt to minimize dependency length is one such
frugal strategy to deal with limited cognitive resources and
the complexity of the task. Given that we often lack the cog-
nitive and computational resources to solve problems exactly,
we tend to use approximation methods as a more viable strat-
egy, leading to bounded rationality (Simon, 1990; Gigerenzer
& Selten, 2002). According to Simon, the following mech-
anisms are used by people to deal with complex problems
and make decisions under the constraints of bounded ratio-
nality – pattern recognition, heuristic search, andextrapo-
lation . Along similar lines, in the case of language, com-
municative efﬁciency can be achieved by using most com-
mon word-order patterns , doing selective search among pos-
sible word orders that place the syntactically related words
close together or salient/predictable words early in the sen-
tence to overcome the memory load. In addition, speakers can
make use to certain properties of languages , such as word-
order ﬂexibility, which provides helpful cues to the listener
for improved understanding. From the listener’s perspective,
ﬂexibility in word order can be challenging, and relying on
various language-speciﬁc cues could be a rational strategy
for them to navigate this challenge within the constraints of
bounded rationality. Therefore, our results and interpreta-
tions of bounded rationality hold from both speaker as well
as hearer perspectives. A thorough investigation from these
perspectives will pave the way for better understanding. To
make more tangible claims about language production in gen-
eral, it will also be necessary to investigate the efﬁcacy of the
least-effort principle on spoken data.
Although bounded rationality may not fully account for all
aspects of language, it may provide an explanation for certain
aspects, such as the extent of dependency length minimiza-
tion, word-order patterns, individual differences in decision-
making processes, and the cognitive mechanisms involved inlanguage use. Future work needs to investigate how different
factors, such as context, task demands, and individual cog-
nitive differences, may affect how speakers and listeners use
boundedly rational strategies.
Overall, our results suggest that within the constraints of
bounded rationality, dependency length minimization is a sig-
niﬁcant predictor of Hindi word order patterns.
