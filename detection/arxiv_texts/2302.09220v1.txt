This note is devoted to show a simple proof of a tight lower bound of
the parameterized compact set packing problem, based on ETH. To see
a more comprehensive study on this problem, we refer to [1].
Notice that according to the well-known sparsiﬁcation lemma [2],
ETH implies that sparse 3-SAT can’t be solved in time 2o(n). “Sparse”
means the number of clauses mis at most linear in n, i.e.m=O(n).
Deﬁnition 1. (Linear) Parameterized Compact Set Packing
Instance: Universe U, set family S, parameter r.|U|=f(r)Θ(log|S|).
Question: Is there rpair-wise disjoint sets from S?
1 A Tight Lower Bound from ETH
A brute-force algorithm for this problem runs in time |S|O(r)|U|O(1), we
provide a lower bound of the form |S|Ω(r).
Theorem 1. There is no algorithm running in time |S|o(r)for Compact
Set Packing, whose instances satisfy |U|=r3Θ(log|S|).
To prove this theorem, we devise a reduction from sparse 3-SAT to
compact set packing.
Lemma 1. For allra computable function of n, there exists a reduc-
tion such that, given a sparse 3-SAT instance φ, a Compact Set Packing
instance Iis created such that φis satisﬁable if and only if Ihas an
r-set packing. The reduction running in time 2O(n/r)poly(n,r), andIhas
Θ(nr2)-size universe and Θ(r2O(n/r))sets.
Proof.Given a 3-SAT instance φ, in which there are nvariables and
m=O(n) clauses. Let rbe an integer. We create a Set Packing instance
in the following.
1Huairui Chu Compact Set Packing
Partition the clauses into rdisjoint sets C1,C2,...,Crsuch that ||Ci| −
m
r| ≤1 for all i∈[r]. Letv(Ci) be the variables that appear in any
clause in Ci. For each i∈[r], letAibe all the partial assignment from
v(Ci) to{0,1}such that each clause in Ciis satisﬁed. There are at most
2|v(Ci)|= 2O(n/r)such assignments.
For each variable x, letGx= (Ux∪Vx,Ex) be a complete bipartite graph
whereUx={ux
1,ux
2,...,ux
r},Vx={vx
1,vx
2,...,vx
r}. For each i∈[r] and
eachpartialassignment a∈Ai, weaddaset Sa. Foreach x∈domain(a),
ifa(x) = 0, we add ( ux
i,vx
j) for all j∈[r] toSa, ifa(x) = 1, we add
(ux
j,vx
i) for allj∈[r] toSa. LetSibe the sets {Sa|a∈Ai}.
EachSicontains at most 2O(n/r)sets, and O(nr) elements. For each Si
we create an ISS of universe size O(n/r) containing |Si|pairwise disjoint
sets. Join each set Sa∈ Sito a unique set in the ISS. To be speciﬁc,
letσibe an injection from Sito the sets of the ISS, we create a new set
familyS′
i={Sa∪σ(Sa)|Sa∈ Si}.
LetXbe the variable set of φ. The set packing instance we created is
(U,S) whereS=∪i∈[r]S′
iandU=∪x∈XEx. The parameter is set to be
r. It’s not hard to see the correctness. The universe size is Θ( nr2), the
set family size is O(r2O(n/r)).
To make it a compact instance, we can add sets such that the set
family size is Θ( r2O(n/r)). One possible way for adding such sets is to
consider a set Dof Θ(nlogr/r) dull elements to the universe. We just
addU ∪Das a new set, for all D⊆ D. So that the ﬁnal instance is
(U′,S′) whereU′=U ∪D,S′=S ∪{U ∪ D|∀D⊆ D}.
Based on Lemma 1, if Compact Set Packing admits |S|o(r)time algo-
rithm, there will be a ro(r)2o(n)+2O(n/r)poly(n,r) algorithm for (linear)
3-SAT for all r. Setrto⌈logn⌉, a contradiction to ETH. This indi-
cates that there is no algorithm running in time |S|o(r)for Compact Set
Packing instances where |U|=r3Θ(log|S|). Thus Theorem 1 is proved.
