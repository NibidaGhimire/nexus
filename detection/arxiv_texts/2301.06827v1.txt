1 Introduction
In the middle of twenth century, the usual idea of convergenc e was extended into statistical convergence by
Fast [13](see also Steinhaus [25]) using the concept of natu ral density of sets. After remarkable works of Fridy
[15] and salat [24], statistical convergence has become an a ctive area of research in last ﬁfty years. In 1985,
Fridy [14] introduced the concept statistically Cauchy seq uences in the following way:
A sequence {xn}n∈Nis said to be statistically Cauchy if for each ǫ(>0)there exists a number N(depending
onǫ) such that the set K(ǫ) ={n∈N:|xn−xN| ≥ǫ}has natural density zero, where the natural density of a
subsetKofNis given as follows: Let Kndenotes the set {k∈K:k≤n}and|Kn|stands for the cardinality
ofKn.The natural density of Kis deﬁned by d(K) = lim
n|Kn|
nif the limit exists.
In 2000, after the introductory work of weak statistical con vergence by cannor et al. [9], Bhardwaj et al. [1]
studied on weak statistically Cauchy sequences in a normed s pace and proved that weak statistically Cauchy
sequences are the same as weak statistically convergent seq uences in a reﬂexive space.
Using the notion of the ideal Iof subsets of the set Nof positive integers, the concepts of ideal conver-
gence (namely IandI∗-convergence) was introduced as a natural generalization o f statistical convergence by
Kostyrko et al.[17, 18]. The idea of I-Cauchy condition and I∗-Cauchy condition in metric spaces were studied
by Dems [10] and Nabiev et al. [20] respectively. In 2010, Das et al.[12] investigated some further results on
I-Cauchyness and established an inter relation between IandI∗-Cauchy condition using AP condition. They
also introduced the concept of IandI∗-divergence and studied on equivalency between them in [20] . In 2010,
Pehlivan et al. [22] studied on weak I-convergence and weak I-Cauchy sequences in a normed space investi-
gating their basic properties. Later Pal et al. [21] studied on the idea of weak IandI∗-divergence in normed
linear spaces and made some important observations. The ide a of weak* ideal convergence of sequences of
functionals was studied by Bhardwaj et al. [2].
In 2010, The idea of IK-convergence as a common generalization of I∗-convergence of sequences was given
by Macaj et al. [19]. In 2014, Das et al. [11] studied on IK-Cauchy and IK-divergence and strengthen the
importance of AP( I,K ) condition in the study of summability theory through doubl e ideals. Later many works
onI-convergence were done in metric spaces [4, 5, 6, 7]. Recentl y, in [8] the idea of weak and weak* IK-
convergence of sequences were studied in a normed space.
In this paper we study the idea of weak IK-Cauchy condition as a generalization of weak I∗-Cauchy condition.

1Next we show the interrelation between weak I-Cauchy and weak IK-Cauchy using the AP (I,K)-condition.
Also we study the idea of weak* IK-Cauchy condition of sequences of functionals and investig ate on weak
IK-divergence as a generalization of weak I∗-divergence.
2 Basic deﬁnitions and notations
Deﬁnition 2.1. LetXbe a non void set and a class I⊂2Xof subsets of Xis said to an ideal if
(i)A,B∈IimpliesA∪B∈Iand (ii)A∈I,B⊂AimpliesB∈I.
It is easy to observe from condition (ii) that φ∈I.Iis said to be nontrivial ideal if I/\e}atio\slash= 2X,{φ}. A
nontrivial ideal Iis called admissible if it contains all the singletons of X. A nontrivial ideal Iis said to be
non-admissible if it is not admissible.
IfIis a non-trivial ideal on a non-void set XthenF=F(I) ={A⊂X:X\A∈I}is clearly a ﬁlter on
Xwhich is called the ﬁlter associated with the ideal I. Throughout the paper, Ndenotes the set of all positive
integers and Xdenotes a normed linear space and X∗is the dual of X.

K(ǫ) ={k∈N:||xk−l|| ≥ǫ}has natural density zero.
Deﬁnition 2.3. [9] A sequence {xn}n∈NinXis said to be weakly statistically convergent to x∈Xif for any

Deﬁnition 2.9. [19] LetKbe an ideal N. We denote A⊂KBwhenever A\B∈K.IfA⊂KBandB⊂KA

3 Weak IK-Cauchy
Deﬁnition 3.1. [10] A sequence {xn}n∈Nis said to be I-Cauchy if for each ǫ >0there exists a number N
(depending on ǫ) such that the set {n∈N:|xn−xN| ≥ǫ} ∈I.
Deﬁnition 3.2. [22] A sequence {xn}inXis said to be a weak I-Cauchy provided that for each ǫ >0and
f∈X∗, there exists a possetive integer N=N(ǫ,f)such that {n∈N:|f(xn)−f(xN)| ≥ǫ} ∈I.
Note 3.1. It is easy to show that if IandI1are any two ideals on Nsuch that I⊆I1then for a sequence {xn}
w−I−limxn=ximpliesw−I1−limxn=x.
Lemma 3.1. (cf [11]) Let Xbe a normed space and let Ibe an ideal on N. Then for any sequence {xn}the
following conditions are equivalent:
(i){xn}is weakI-Cauchy.
(ii) For any ǫ >0there is an integer Nsuch that {n∈N:|f(xn)−f(xN)|< ǫ} ∈F(I).
(iii) For every ǫ(>0)there exists a set A∈Isuch that m,n /∈Aimplies|f(xm)−f(xn)|< ǫ.
Lemma 3.2. A weakly I-convergent sequence {xn}is weakI-Cauchy.
Proof. The proof is straightforward and so omitted.
In this paper, our main aim is to generalize the notion of weak I∗-Cauchyness of sequences. The deﬁnition
of weakI∗-Cauchy sequences as introduced in[20] is as follows.
Deﬁnition 3.3. ([20]) A sequence {xn}n∈NinXis said to be weak I∗-Cauchy if there exists a set M={m1<
m2< ... < m k< ...} ∈F(I)such that the subsequence {f(xmk)}is Cauchy in the ordinary sense for each
f∈X∗.
Deﬁnition 3.4. LetI,K be two ideals on the set N. A sequence {xn}n∈NinXis said to be weak IK-Cauchy if
there exists a set M∈F(I)such that the sequence {xn}n∈Mis weakK|M-Cauchy, where K|M={A∩M:
A∈K}
Lemma 3.3. Every weakly IK-convergent sequence is weak IK-Cauchy.
- The proof is directly follows from the deﬁnition and so is om itted.
3Proposition 3.1. LetXbe a normed space. Let I,I1,K,K1be ideals on the set Nsuch that I⊆I1and
K⊆K1.
(i) If{xn}is weakIK-Cauchy then it is also weak IK
1-Cauchy.
(ii) If{xn}is weakIK-Cauchy then it is also weak IK1-Cauchy.
Proof. If{xn}is weakIK-Cauchy then there exists a subset M∈F(I)such that {xn}n∈Mis weakK|M-
Cauchy.
(i) Now as I⊆I1soF(I)⊆F(I1). Then we have M∈F(I1)and so{xn}is also weak IK
1-Cauchy.
(ii) Since K⊆K1soK|M⊆K1|M. So from the lemma3.1, we get that if {xn}n∈Mis weakK|M-Cauchy
then it is also weak K1|M-Cauchy. Hence {xn}is weakIK1-Cauchy
Lemma 3.4. IfIandKare ideals on Nand if a sequence {xn}n∈Nis weakK-Cauchy, then it is also weak
IK-Cauchy.
Proof. If we take M=NthenM∈F(I), in this case K|M=K, hence{xn}n∈Mis weakK|M-Cauchy.
This shows that {xn}is weakIK-Cauchy.
Proposition 3.2. A sequence {xn}n∈N∈Xis weakII-Cauchy if and only if it is weak I-Cauchy.
Proof. Since{xn}is weakII-Cauchy so there exists an M∈F(I)such that the sequence {xn}n∈Mis weak
I|M-Cauchy i.e. for each ǫ(>0)there isF∈F(I)such that m,n∈F∩M⇒ |f(xm)−f(xn)|< ǫ. Since
the setF∩M∈F(I), this shows that {xn}is weakI-Cauchy.
Converse part follows from the lemma 3.4 by taking K=I.
Corollary 3.1. LetI,K be two ideals on N. For a sequence {xn}inX, weakIK-Cauchyness implies weak
I-Cauchyness if K⊂I.
Proof. If the sequence is {xn}weakIK-Cauchy then it follows from the proposition 3.1(ii) that it is weak
II-Cauchy. So by previous theorem we get that {xn}is weakI-Cauchy.
For any two ideals I,K onN, the setI∨K={A∪B:A∈I,B∈K}is an ideal on Nand this the smallest
ideal containing both IandK, The dual ﬁlter is F(I∨K) =F(I)∨F(K) ={F∩G:F∈F(I),G∈F(K)}
Theorem 3.1. LetI,K be ideals on a set N. A sequence {xn}inXis weakIK-Cauchy if and only if it is
weak(I∨K)K-Cauchy.
Proof. SinceI⊂(I∨K)so by proposition 3.1(i) we get that weak IK-Cauchyness implies weak (I∨K)K-
Cauchyness of {xn}.
Conversely, assume that {xn}is weak(I∨K)K-Cauchy so there exists a set M∈F(I∨K)such that
{xn}|n∈Mis weakK|M-Cauchy that is for every ǫ(>0)and for every f∈X∗there exists F∈F(K)such
thatm,n∈F∩M⇒ |f(xn)−f(xm)|< ǫ. Again it is obvious that M=M′∩Gfor some M′∈F(I)
andG∈F(K). If we put F′=F∩GthenF′∈F(K)andF′∩M′=F∩G∩M′=F∩Mwhich gives
n,m∈F′∩M′⇒ |f(xn)−f(xm)|< ǫ. So{xn}is weakIK-Cauchy.
Theorem 3.2. LetXbe a normed space and I,K be ideals on Nthen a weak I-Cauchy sequence {xn}inX
is weakIK-Cauchy if and only if AP (I,K)condition holds.
First suppose that AP (I,K)condition holds. Since {xn}is weakI-Cauchy, so for every r∈N, we
can ﬁnd a set Gr∈Isuch that s,t /∈Grimplies|f(xs)−f(xt)|<1
r. LetA1=G1,A2=G2\G1,
A3=G3\(G1∪G2)...etc. Then {Ai:i∈N}is a countable family of mutual disjoint sets in I. Since
AP(I,K ) condition holds, there exists a family of sets {Bi:i∈N} ∈Isuch that B=∪i∈NBi∈Iand for
everyj∈Nwe haveAj△Bj∈Ki.e.Aj△Bj=N\Cjfor some Cj∈F(K). LetM=N\Bandǫ >0
be given. Choose r∈Nsuch that1
r< ǫ. Now,Gr∩M=Gr\B⊆ ∪r
i=1(Ai\Bi)⊆ ∪r
i=1(N\Ci) =N\C,
whereC=∩r
i=1Ci∈F(K). ThenGc
r∩M∩C⊇M∩C(for otherwise there is an s∈M∩Cbuts /∈Gc
rthat
isB∈Grand sos∈Gr∩M∩C⊆N\Cwhich is a contradiction.) This shows that s,t∈C∩Mimplies
s,t∈Gc
rwhich implies |f(xs)−f(xt)|<1
r< ǫ. ButC∩M∈F(K|M)i.e.{f(xn)}n∈MisK|M-Cauchy
i.e.{xn}n∈Mis weakK|M-Cauchy. Hence the sequence {xn}n∈Mis weakIK-Cauchy.
4Theorem 3.3. LetXbe a normed space and I,K be ideals on N. Suppose that every weak I-Cauchy sequence
is weakIK-Cauchy. Then the condition AP( I,K ) holds.
Proof. Letx0∈Xbe a point such that x0is not an isolated point and let {yn}n∈Nbe a sequence of distinct
points in Xsuch that {yn}convergent to x0. Let{Ai:i∈N}be a sequence of mutually disjoint non-empty
sets from I. We deﬁne a sequence {xn}by
xn=/braceleftbigg
yjifn∈Aj
x0ifn /∈Ajfor anyj
Letf∈X∗be arbitrary and ǫ(>0)be given. Choose k∈Nsuch that |f(yn)−f(x0)|<ǫ
2for eachn≥k.
Now the set D={n∈N:|f(yn)−f(x0)| ≥ǫ}has the property that D⊆A1∪A2∪...∪Akand soD∈I
and such that s,t /∈Dimplies|f(xs)−f(xt)| ≤ |f(xs)−f(x0)|+|f(xt)−f(x0)|< ǫ. This shows that
f(xn)isI-Cauchy i.e. {xn}is weakI-Cauchy. Then by our assumption {xn}is weakIK-Cauchy. Hence
there is a set M∈F(I)such that {xn}n∈Mis weakK|M-Cauchy. Let Bj=Aj\M. ThenBj∈Ifor each
jand∪jBj⊆N\M∈I, clearlyAj△Bj=Aj\Bj=Aj∩Mfor every j. There may arrise two cases.
Case-1: If Aj∩M∈Kfor allj∈Nthen AP(I,K)holds. If Aj∩M /∈Kfor at most one j, sayj0, then
redeﬁning Bj0=AJ0,Bj=Aj\Mwhenj/\e}atio\slash=j0, we again observe that the condition AP( I,K ) holds.
Case-2: Finally if possible suppose that Aj∩M /∈Kfor at least two j′s. Letl1andl2be two such indices.
We shall show that this is not possible. We have C1=Al1∩M /∈KandC2=Al2∩M /∈Kwherel1/\e}atio\slash=l2.
Now any E∈F(K|M)is of the form E=C∩MwhereC∈F(K). NowC∩C1/\e}atio\slash=φ( otherwise we will
haveC1⊆N\C∈K, which is not the case. By similar reasoning C∩C2/\e}atio\slash=φ.) Then there is an s∈Esuch
thats∈Al1i.e.xs=yl1and at∈Esuch that t∈Al2i.e.xt=yl2. Now choosing 0< ǫ0<|f(yl1)−f(yl2)|
3
we observe that for every E∈F(K|M)there exist points s,t∈Esuch that |f(xs)−f(xt)|> ǫ0or, in other
words, for this ǫ0, there does not exists any D∈K|Msuch that s,t /∈Dimplies|f(xs)−f(xt)|< ǫ0. But
this contradicts the fact that {xn}n∈Mis weakIK-Cauchy. Hence case-2 can not arise.
4 Weak* I-Cauchy
Deﬁnition 4.1. A sequence {fn}inX∗is said to be weak* I-Cauchy sequence if for each ǫ(>0)andx∈X
there exists a positive integer Nsuch that {n∈N:|fn(x)−fN(x)| ≥ǫ} ∈I.
Deﬁnition 4.2. A sequence {fn}inX∗is said to be weak* I∗-Cauchy sequence if there exists a set M=
{m1< m2< m3< ... < m k< ...} ∈F(I)such that {fmk(x)}is Cauchy in ordinary sense for every
x∈X.
Theorem 4.1. LetXbe a normed space with dual X∗and{fn}be a sequence in X∗. If{fn}is weak*
I∗-Cauchy then it is weak* I-Cauchy.
Proof. Let{fn}be a weak* I∗-Cauchy sequence in X∗. Now from the deﬁnition we have there exists a set
M={m1< m2< m3< ... < m k< ...} ∈F(I)such that {fmk(x)}is Cauchy in ordinary sense for
everyx∈X, that is, for every ǫ(>0)there exists a positive integer k0such that |fmk(x)−fmp(x)|< ǫ
for allk,p > k 0. LetN=N(ǫ,x) =mk0+1then we have |fmk(x)−fN(x)|< ǫ whenk > k 0. Now
M0=N\M∈IandA(ǫ,x) ={n∈N:|fn(x)−fN(x)| ≥ǫ} ⊂M0∪{m1,m2,...,mk0} ∈I. Hence the
result follows.
Theorem 4.2. LetXbe a norm space with dual X∗. If a sequence {fk}inX∗is weakI-Cauchy then it is
weak*I-Cauchy.
Proof. Let{fk}be a weak I-Cauchy in X∗.Then for each ǫ(>0)andg∈X∗∗there exists a positive
integerNsuch that {n∈N:|g(fn)−g(fN)| ≥ǫ} ∈I→(1). Letx∈Xandgx=C(x)where
C:X→X∗∗is the cannonical mapping. So we have, gx(fn) =fn(x)andgx(fN) =fN(x)and therefore ,
by (1),{n∈N:|gx(fn)−gx(fN)| ≥ǫ} ∈I. Hence{fk}is weak* I-Cauchy.
5Theorem 4.3. LetXbe a reﬂexive Banach space. If a sequence {fk}inX∗is weak*I-Cauchy then it is weak
I-Cauchy.
Proof. LetXbe a reﬂexive space. Since {fk}is weak* I-Cauchy then for each x∈Xandǫ(>0)there
exists positive integer Nsuch that the set {n∈N:|fn(x)−fN(x)| ≥ǫ} ∈I. Letg∈X∗∗. SinceXis
reﬂexive, g=C(x)for some x∈XwhereC:X→X∗∗is a cannonical mapping. Since g(fn) =fn(x)and
g(fN) =fN(x)we have{n∈N:|g(fn)−g(fN)| ≥ǫ} ∈Ifor eachǫ >0. Since the result is true for every
g∈X∗∗,{fk}is weakI-Cauchy.
Deﬁnition 4.3. LetI,K be two ideals on the set N. A sequence {fn}inX∗is said to be weak* IK-Cauchy if
there exists a set M∈F(I)such that the sequence {fn}|Mis weak* K|M-Cauchy where K|M={A∩M:
A∈K}
Theorem 4.4. LetXbe a normed space. If a sequence {fk}inX∗is weakIK-Cauchy then it is weak*
IK-Cauchy.
Proof follows directly from the deﬁnition and Theorem 4.2.
Note 4.1. It is easy to observe that using deﬁnition of weak* IK-convergence and theorem 4.3, converse of the
above theorem also holds when Xis a reﬂexive Banach space.
5 Weak IK-divergence
Deﬁnition 5.1. [11] A sequence {xn}n∈Nin a normed space Xis said to be I-divergent if there exists an
elementx∈Xsuch that for any positive real number G,
A(x,G) ={n∈N:|xn−x| ≤G} ∈I.
Deﬁnition 5.2. [11] A sequence {xn}n∈Nin a normed space Xis said to be weak I-divergent if for each
f∈X∗,{f(xn)}n∈NisI-divergent i.e. there exists an element x∈Xsuch that for any positive real number
G,
A(f(x),G) ={n∈N:|f(xn)−f(x)| ≤G} ∈I.
Deﬁnition 5.3. [11] A sequence {xn}n∈Nin a normed linear space Xis said to be I∗-divergent if there exists
a setM∈F(I)such that {xn}n∈Mis properly divergent i.e. there exists an x∈Xsuch that |xn−x| →0as
n→ ∞ .
Deﬁnition 5.4. A sequence {xn}n∈Nin a normed space Xis said to be weak I∗-divergent if for each f∈X∗
there exists a set M∈F(I){f(xn)}n∈Mis properly divergent.
Deﬁnition 5.5. LetKandIbe two ideals on N. A sequence {xn}n∈Nin a normed space Xis said to be
IK-divergent if there exists a set M∈F(I)such that {xn}n∈MisK|M-divergent.
Deﬁnition 5.6. LetKandIbe two ideals on N. A sequence {xn}n∈Nin a normed linear space Xis said to be
weakIK-divergent if for each f∈X∗there exists a set M∈F(I)such that {f(xn)}n∈MisK|M-divergent.
Lemma 5.1. If a sequence {xn}is weakK-divergent then it is also weak IK-divergent.
Proof. If we consider M=N∈F(I)andK|M=Kthen the proof follows from deﬁnition directly.
Lemma 5.2. If a sequence {xn}is weakK-divergent then it is also weak IK-divergent.
