Abstract
The limit q-Durrmeyer operator, D∞,q,was introduced and its approximation proper-
ties wereinvestigated byV. Guptain 2008 duringastudyof q-analogues fortheBernstein-
Durrmeyer operator. In the present work, this operator is in vestigated from a diﬀerent
perspective. More precisely, the growth estimates are deri ved for the entire functions com-
prising the range of D∞,q. The interrelation between the analytic properties of a fun ction
fand the rate of growth for D∞,qfare established, and the sharpness of the obtained
results are demonstrated.

1 Introduction
The signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the Bernstein polynomials on modern math ematics - not only the-
oretical, but also applied and computational - brought about the em ergence of its numerous
versions and modiﬁcations. See, for example, [2, 3, 12]. While the Be rnstein polynomials serve
to approximate the continuous functions on [0 ,1], the Kantorovich polynomials constructed
with respect to the Bernstein basis are applicable for the approxima tion of integrable func-
tions. Kantorovich’s breakthrough idea was further developed by Durrmeyer [7] and Derriennic
[6]. The latter proved that the Bernstein-Durrmeyer polynomials ap proximate functions in
L1[0,1], and also generate self-adjoint operators in L2[0,1].
1With the increasing role of the q-Calculus (see, e.g. [1, 4, 5, 15]), the q-analogues of various
Bernstein-type operators have come to the fore. The reader is r eferred to [3, 8, 14]. New
versions of these operators, targeting a wide spectrum of variou s problems, are continuously
coming out.
In 2008, V. Gupta [9] introduced a simple q-analogueof the Bernstein-Durrmeyer operators,
denotedby Dn,q,andstudieditsapproximationproperties. Oneofthepropertiesth atheproved
was that {Dn,q}converges to the limit operator D∞,qin the strong operator topologyon C[0,1].
More results on the q-Durrmeyer operator have been obtained in [10, 13].
In the present work, further investigation is carried out concern ing the limit q-Bernstein-
Durrmeyeroperator. Distinctfromthepreceding studiesonthes ubject, thispaperisfocusedon
the analytic properties that the image of f∈C[0,1] possesses under the operator D∞,q. Here,
it is proved that, for each f∈C[0,1], the function D∞,qfadmits an analytic continuation from
[0,1] to the whole complex plane C. The growth estimates of the entire function D∞,qfare
provided, along with the interconnection between the growth of D∞,qfand the behaviour of f.
The sharpness of the obtained results is demonstrated.
To present the results, let us recollect the necessary notation an d deﬁnitions. The q-
Pochhammer symbol denotes, for each a∈C,
(a;q)0:= 1,(a;q)n=n−1/productdisplay
j=0(1−aqj),(a;q)∞=∞/productdisplay
j=0(1−aqj).

[11], is deﬁned as

j=0qjf(aqj). (1.3)
Deﬁnition 1.1. [9] Letq∈(0,1),f∈C[0,1].The limit q-Durrmeyer operator is deﬁned by
(D∞,qf)(x) :=D∞,q(f;x) =/braceleftBigg/summationtext∞

As coeﬃcients (1.4) form a bounded sequence whatever f∈C[0,1] is, the function D∞,qf
admits an analytic continuation from [0 ,1] to open disc {z:|z|<1}.Taking into account (1.3),
A∞k(f) can also be expressed as

Throughout the paper, letter C - with or without subscripts - deno tes a positive constant
whose speciﬁc value is of no importance. Subscripts, when used, ind icate the dependence of C
on certain parameters. It should be pointed out that the same lett er may stand for diﬀerent
values. Moreover, if fis analytic in the closed disc ∆ r:={z:|z|/lessorequalslantr},the notation
M(r;f) := max
z∈∆r|f(z)|
will be employed.
The article is organized asfollows: InSection 2, the mainoutcomes ar estated, while Section
3 contains the auxiliary technical lemmas. Finally, the proofs of the m ain results appear in
Section 4.
2 Statement of Results
Theorem 2.1. For each f∈C[0,1], the function (D∞,qf)(x)admits an analytic continuation
from[0,1]as an entire function given by
(D∞,qf)(z) =∞/summationdisplay
j=0f(qj)qj
(q;q)j∞/summationdisplay
n=0(−1)nqn(n+1)/2
(q;q)n(z;q)n+j. (2.1)
The proof of Theorem 2.1 presented in Section 4 yields, apart from ( 2.1), the following
corollary:
Corollary 2.2. The growth of D∞,qf, for each f∈C[0,1], enjoys the following estimate:
M(r;D∞,qf) =O((−r;q)∞), r→ ∞. (2.2)
3It is worth pointing out that coeﬃcients (1.6) can be viewed as the va lues of the function
g(z) := (qz;q)∞ρ(z) at points z=qk,k= 0,1,..., where
ρ(z) =∞/summationdisplay
j=0f(qj)qj
(q;q)jzj. (2.3)
Since (qz;q)∞is entire and the series converges in the disc {z:|z|<1/q}for anyf∈C[0,1], it
followsthat gisanalyticinthatdisc. Clearly, theradiusofconvergence for ρcanbegreaterthan
1/q. The representation below of D∞,qwith the help of divided diﬀerences of gis important.
Theorem 2.3. Givenf∈C[0,1], letg(z) = (qz;q)∞ρ(z), whereρis deﬁned by (2.3). Then,
(D∞,qf)(z) =∞/summationdisplay
k=0(−1)kqk(k−1)/2g[1;q;...;qk]zk, z∈C.
Here,g[x0;...;xk]stands for the divided diﬀerence of gat the distinct nodes x0,...,x k.
This representation allows us to not only reﬁne the estimate of Coro llary 2.2, but also
establish a connection between the behaviour of fand the growth of its image under D∞,q.
Theorem 2.4. LetR >1be such that ρis analytic in ∆R. Then,
M(r;D∞,qf) =o/parenleftbigg(−r;q)∞
rλ/parenrightbigg
, r→ ∞,
for every λ <(lnR)/ln(1/q).
As a consequence of Theorem 2.4, the crude estimate (2.2) can be im proved. Since ρis
analytic in {z:|z|<1/q},it is possible to assume λ= 0 in Theorem 2.4 and obtain the
following result.
Corollary 2.5. For anyf∈C[0,1],
M(r;D∞,qf) =o((−r;q)∞), r→ ∞.
Corollary 2.6. Iff(qj) =O(qαj),j→ ∞, for some α >0, then
M(r;D∞,qf) =o(r−λ(−r;q)∞), r→ ∞, (2.4)
for allλ <1+α.
Indeed, in this case, ρis analytic in {z:|z|< q−1−α}.
Corollary 2.7. If, for every α >0, the estimate f(qj) =o(qαj),j→ ∞holds, then, for every
λ/greaterorequalslant0,(2.4)is true.
4The estimate in Theorem 2.4 is sharp as demonstrated by the assert ion below.
Theorem 2.8. For every λ >1,there exists f∈C[0,1]such that
M(r;D∞,qf)/greaterorequalslantCr−λ(−r;q)∞, r→ ∞.
Theorem 2.4 and Corollaries 2.5-2.7 establish the connection between the radius of conver-
gence for series (2.3) and the rate of growth for D∞,qf.In the general sense, the greater the
radius is, the slower the growth becomes. Approaching the problem from a diﬀerent angle, the
dependence of the growth on the diﬀerentiability of fat the origin is addressed in the next
assertion. The statement makes it possible to obtain better estima tes forM(r;D∞,qf) than
those guaranteed by Theorem 2.4 when fis diﬀerentiable at 0 even though the series (2.3)
converges solely in the smallest admissible disc.
Theorem 2.9. Letfbemtimes diﬀerentiable at 0from the right. Then,
M(r;D∞,qf) =o(r−λ(−r;q)∞), r→ ∞, (2.5)
for allλ <1+m.
Corollary 2.10. Iffis inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable at 0from the right, then (2.5)holds for all
λ >0.In particular, (2.5)is valid whenever fis analytic in a neighbourhood of 0.

In what comes next, the function τgiven by

plays a key role.
Lemma 3.1. The function τadmits an analytic continuation from the open unit disc as an
entire function.
Proof.Consider

(q;q)∞.
By (1.1), with z=qk+1,one has

By virtue of (1.2), it follows that

n=0(−1)nqn(n+1)/2

Consequently, one obtains
τ(z) =1
(q;q)∞∞/summationdisplay
n=0(−1)nqn(n+1)/2
(q;q)n(z;q)∞
(qnz;q)∞
=1
(q;q)∞∞/summationdisplay
n=0(−1)nqn(n+1)/2
(q;q)n(z;q)n,|z|<1. (3.1)
Now, ifz∈∆R,then

n=0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(−1)nqn(n+1)/2

n=0qn(n+1)/2
(q;q)n(1+R)n<∞.
Hence,τ(z) is analytic in ∆ Rfor eachR >0 and (3.1) is valid for all z∈C. Therefore, τ(z) is
an entire function.
Lemma 3.2. LetR >1be such that ρgiven by (2.3)is analytic in {z:|z|/lessorequalslantR}. Then,
/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg[1;q;...;qk]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/lessorequalslantCqλk
for every λ <(lnR)/ln(1/q).
Proof.It is known that (see for example, [12, Section 2.7., p.44, Eq. (4)])
g[a0;...;ak] =1
2πi/contintegraldisplay
Lg(ζ)dζ
(ζ−a0)...(ζ−ak),
whereLis a positively-oriented, simple and closed curve encircling the distinct pointsa0,...,a k
andgis analytic anywhere on and inside L.
6Therefore,
g[1;q;...;qk] =1
2πi/contintegraldisplay
|ζ|=Rg(ζ)dζ
(ζ−1)(ζ−q)...(ζ−qk).
Now, given λ0such that 0 < λ0<(lnR)/ln(1/q),that is, 1 < q−λ0< R.The two cases will be
considered:
Case 1. Ifq−λ0/lessorequalslantR−1,theng[1;q;...;qk] can be estimated as
/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg[1;q;...;qk]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/lessorequalslant1
2π·M(R;g)
(R−1)(R−q)...(R−qk)·2πR
/lessorequalslantM(R;g)R
(R−1)k+1/lessorequalslant2M(R;g)qλ0k.
Case 2. IfR−1< q−λ0/lessorequalslantR,then opt for m0∈N0such that R−qm> q−λ0whenever
m/greaterorequalslantm0.Then, for k/greaterorequalslantm0,one has
/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg[1;q;...;qk]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/lessorequalslantM(R;g)R
(R−1)···(R−qm0−1)(R−qm0)···(R−qk)
/lessorequalslantM(R;g)R
(R−1)···(R−qm0−1)·1
(R−qm0)k−m0+1
/lessorequalslantCR,q,g1
(R−qm0)k< Cqλ0k, k/greaterorequalslantm0.
As a result,/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg[1;q;...;qk]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/lessorequalslantCqλ0kfor allk,possibly with a diﬀerent C.
Combining the outcomes of the two cases yields/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg[1;q;...;qk]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/lessorequalslantCqλ0k,and, in turn,/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg[1;q;...;qk]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/lessorequalslantCqλkfor allλ/lessorequalslantλ0.Sinceλ0has been chosen arbitrarily, it follows that the
latter inequality holds for all λ <(lnR)/ln(1/q) as stated.

By (3.1),
τ(qjz) =1
(q;q)∞∞/summationdisplay
n=0(−1)nqn(n+1)/2
(q;q)n(qjz;q)n,
and, hence,
(D∞,qf)(z) =∞/summationdisplay
j=0f(qj)qj
(q;q)j(z;q)j∞/summationdisplay
n=0(−1)nqn(n+1)/2
(q;q)n(qjz;q)n

j=0f(qj)qj
(q;q)j∞/summationdisplay
n=0(−1)nqn(n+1)/2
(q;q)n(z;q)j+n,|z|<1. (4.1)
Since, for R >0 andz∈∆R, one has |(z;q)j+n|/lessorequalslant(−R;q)∞for allj,n∈N0, the series in (4.1)
converges uniformly in any closed disc ∆ R.Therefore,
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∞/summationdisplay
n=0(−1)nqn(n+1)/2
(q;q)n(z;q)j+n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/lessorequalslant(−R;q)∞∞/summationdisplay
n=0qn(n+1)/2
(q;q)n= (−R;q)∞(−q;q)∞
which implies that, when z∈∆R,

j=0|f(qj)|qj
(q;q)j/lessorequalslant/bardblf/bardblC[0,1](−R;q)∞(−q;q)∞
(q;q)∞=:Cf,q(−R;q)∞.
Consequently, ( D∞,qf)(z) is analytic in any disc of radius R >0. Thus, ( D∞,qf)(z) is entire.
This completes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 2.3. Starting from (1.6), one arrives at
A∞k(f) = (qk+1;q)∞∞/summationdisplay
j=0f(qj)q(k+1)j
(q;q)j= [(qz;q)∞ρ(z)]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

8Therefore,
(D∞,qf)(z) = (z;q)∞∞/summationdisplay
k=0g(qk)zk
(q;q)k,|z|<1/q.
Application of Euler’s identity (1.1) leads to

j=0(−1)kqk(k−1)/2g(qj)zk+j

zk,|z|<1/q.
Employing [12, p. 44, formula (3)] with xj=qj, one arrives at
g[1;q;...;qk] =k/summationdisplay
j=0(−1)−jg(qj)
qj(j−1)/2(q;q)jqj(k−j)(q;q)k−j.
Therefore, formula
(D∞,qf)(z) =∞/summationdisplay
k=0(−1)kqk(k−1)/2g[1;q;...;qk]zk
holds for |z|<1/qand also in every disc where D∞,qfpossess an analytic continuation.
Applying Theorem 2.1, one completes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 2.4. By Theorem 2.3,
(D∞,qf)(z) =∞/summationdisplay
k=0(−1)kqk(k−1)/2g[1;q;...;qk]zk, z∈C.
Selectλ <(lnR)/ln(1/q) and take µsuch that λ < µ < (lnR)/ln(1/q). Now, the growth of
D∞,qfmay be estimated with the help of Lemma 3.2, which implies |g[1;q;...;qk]|/lessorequalslantCqµk.
Therefore,
|(D∞,qf)(z)|/lessorequalslantC∞/summationdisplay
k=0qk(k−1)/2(qµ|z|)k/lessorequalslantC∞/summationdisplay
k=0qk(k−1)/2
(q;q)k(qµ|z|)k,
9and, hence,
M(r;D∞,qf)/lessorequalslantC(−qµr;q)∞.
Recall [17, formula (2.6)] that, for rlarge enough,
C1exp/braceleftBigln2r
2ln(1/q)+lnr
2/bracerightBig
/lessorequalslant(−r;q)∞/lessorequalslantC2exp/braceleftBigln2r

.
Consequently,
C1(−r;q)∞
rµ/lessorequalslant(−qµr;q)∞/lessorequalslantC2(−r;q)∞
rµ(4.2)
forrlarge enough.
As a result,
M(r;D∞,qf) =O/parenleftbigg(−r;q)∞
rµ/parenrightbigg
, r→ ∞,
=o/parenleftbigg(−r;q)∞
rλ/parenrightbigg
, r→ ∞,
as stated.
Proof of Theorem 2.8. Forλ >1,setα=qλ−1∈(0,1) and
sj=j/summationdisplay
k=0αk
(q;q)j−k, j∈N0.
Obviously, the sequence {sj}is bounded. In addition, it is increasing because, for j∈N0,
sj+1−sj=j/summationdisplay
k=0αk/parenleftbigg1
(q;q)j+1−k−1
(q;q)j−k/parenrightbigg
+αj+1>0.
Consequently, {sj}converges. Now, let f∈C[0,1] be such that f(qj) = (q;q)jsj.This is
possible due to the fact that {(q;q)jsj}is convergent as a product of two convergent sequences.
For thisf, one has
ρ(z) =∞/summationdisplay
j=0sj(qz)j.
Evidently, ρis analytic in {z:|z|<1/q}and
ρ(z) =∞/summationdisplay
j=0/parenleftBiggj/summationdisplay
k=0αk
(q;q)j−k/parenrightBigg
(qz)j=∞/summationdisplay
j=0(qz)j
(q;q)j∞/summationdisplay
k=0(αqz)k=1
(qz;q)∞·1
1−αqz,|z|<1/q.
10Hence,g(z) =ρ(z)(qz;q)∞= 1/(1−αqz),whencegis analytic in {z:|z|<1/(αq)}.Plain
calculations reveal:
g(k)(z) =(αq)kk!
(1−αqz)k+1, k∈N0.
By the Intermediate Value Theorem,
g[1;q;...;qk] =g(k)(ξ)
k!, ξ∈(qk,1).
Since all g(k)(x) are increasing on [0 ,1],there holds
g[1;q;...;qk]/greaterorequalslantg(k)(qk)
k!=(αq)k
(1−αqk+1)k+1/greaterorequalslant(αq)k, k∈N0.
As a result,
M(r;D∞,qf) =∞/summationdisplay
k=0qk(k−1)/2g[1;q;...;qk]rk/greaterorequalslant(q;q)∞∞/summationdisplay
k=0qk(k−1)/2
(q;q)k(αqr)k= (q;q)∞(−αqr;q)∞.
Writingα=qλ−1and using (4.2), one obtains
M(r;D∞,qf)/greaterorequalslantCr−λ(−r;q)∞, r→ ∞,
which completes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 2.9. By Taylor’s Theorem, one can write
f(x) =Tm(x)+Sm(x)
whereTm(x) is a polynomial of degree at most mandSm(x) =o(xm) asx→0+. SinceD∞,q
maps a polynomial to a polynomial of the same degree (see [9, Remar k 3]), there holds
(D∞,qf)(z) =Pm(z)+(D∞,qSm)(z),
wherePm(z) is a polynomial of degree at most mand, as such,
M(r;Pm) =o(r−λ(−r;q)∞), r→ ∞,
for allλ >0. As for M(r;D∞,qSm), it can be estimated by means of Corollary 2.6 with
α=m.
