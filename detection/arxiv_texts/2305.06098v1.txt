Abstract
Relaxation modulus and creep compliance corresponding to fractional anti-Zener and Zener models are
calculated and restrictions on model parameters narrowing thermodynamical constraints are posed in order
to ensure relaxation modulus and creep compliance to be completely monotone and Bernstein function
respectively, that a priori guarantee the positivity of stored energy and dissipated power per unit volume,
derived in time domain by considering the power per unit volume. Both relaxation modulus and creep
compliance for model parameters obeying thermodynamical constraints, proved that can also be oscillatory
functions with decreasing amplitude. Model used in numerical examples of relaxation modulus and creep
compliance is also analyzed for the asymptotic behavior near the initial time instant and for large time.
Key words : thermodynamically consistent fractional anti-Zener and Zener models, energy balance prop-
erties in time domain, stored energy and dissipated power per unit volume, relaxation modulus and creep
compliance, completely monotonic and Bernstein functions
1 Introduction
Fractional anti-Zener and Zener models, that are the subject of the energy balance analysis in time domain, are
formulated in [33] by considering the rheological schemes corresponding to the classical anti-Zener and Zener
models having the classical spring replaced by the fractional element whose stress-strain relation is assumed in
terms of fractional integral, as well as having the classical dash-pot replaced by the Scott-Blair element, i.e.,
element whose stress-strain relation is assumed in terms of fractional derivative. Note, the classical anti-Zener
model is also referred to as the Jeﬀrey model, as discussed in [52] reviewing classical and fractional models
of viscoelasticity. Some of the ﬁrst to use the Scott-Blair element in posing the constitutive equations using
classical rheological schemes are [51], while some of the most widely used fractional order models of viscoelastic
body derived using the rheological schemes containing Scott-Blair element are reviewed in [36, 50]. Rheological
scheme of the Burgers model with the classical dash-pot replaced by the Scott-Blair element is adopted in [40],
in order to fractionalize the classical Burgers model. Inﬁnite number of springs and dash-pots in the rheological
scheme is used in [18, 23, 24] in order to formulate the Bessel model, while the setting of fractal rheological
models is used in [29].
The analysis of thermodynamical consistency of constitutive models in the steady state regime, i.e., by
requesting non-negativity of the storage and loss modulus for any frequency, is given in [10]. This method is used
in [33] for formulation of thermodynamical restrictions on model parameters appearing in the fractional anti-
Zener and Zener models, as well as in [40] and [12] for the fractional Burgers model, where the fractionalization
is performed by replacing the classical dash-pot element with the fractional one in the former, as well as by
replacing the ordinary derivatives with the fractional ones in the classical Burgers model in the latter one.
Constitutive models of viscoelastic body having the orders of fractional derivatives not exceeding the ﬁrst order
areexaminedforthermodynamicalconsistencyin[5]. Consideringtimedomain, thedissipationinequalityisalso
used in order to pose thermodynamical restrictions on model parameters, see for example [3, 4], while the energy
balance properties of the fractional wave equations are examined in [53]. Dissipation of energy in viscoelastic
media of Bessel type, the wave equation thermodynamical consistency and the requirements guaranteeing the
complete monotonicity, as well as the analysis of the Zener wave equation are presented in [19, 22, 31, 39]. The
extensive account on thermodynamics of hereditary materials can be found in [2].

1arXiv:2305.06098v1  [math.AP]  10 May 2023A priori energy balance properties of fractional anti-Zener and Zener models, that are formulated in [33] and
analyzed for thermodynamical consistency in the steady-state regime, are discussed in time domain and it is
proved that the power per unit volume consists of two terms: the time derivative of the energy per unit volume
stored in the viscoelastic body and dissipated power per unit volume. The stored energy per unit volume,
expressed through strain, consists of the instantaneous term, that is of the same form as the potential energy of
elastic body in which the relaxation modulus plays the role of the Young modulus, as well as of the hereditary
type term, where the time derivative of the relaxation modulus represents the memory kernel of the diﬀerence of
current strain and strain in the previous time instant. Dissipated power per unit volume, expressed in terms of
strain, also consists of the instantaneous and hereditary type terms, respectively containing the ﬁrst and second
time derivative of the relaxation modulus. The positivity of stored energy and dissipated power per unit volume
is guaranteed if the relaxation modulus is a positive monotonically decreasing and convex function, or moreover
a completely monotone function. Note, the relaxation modulus is a function representing the time evolution of
stress in a stress relaxation experiment, occurring as a consequence of the sudden and later constant strain, i.e.,
strain prescribed as the Heaviside step function.
The stored energy per unit volume can also be expressed through stress, when there is only the hereditary
type term, having the time derivative of the creep compliance as the memory kernel multiplying the time
evolution of stress, while the dissipated power per unit volume consists of the instantaneous and hereditary type
terms, respectively containing the ﬁrst and second time derivative of the creep compliance. Again, the positivity
of stored energy and dissipated power per unit volume is guaranteed if the creep compliance is a positive
monotonically increasing and concave function, or moreover a Bernstein function. Note, the creep compliance
is a function representing the time evolution of strain in a creep experiment, occurring as a consequence of the
sudden and later constant stress, i.e., stress prescribed as the Heaviside step function.
The important property of relaxation modulus being completely monotonic and creep compliance being a
Bernstein function is discussed in [36]. On the other hand, the complete monotonicity of relaxation modus in the
case of distributed-order fractional Zener model is studied in [11], while [37] deals with the fractional Burgers
model in creep and stress relaxation tests. The relaxation modulus and creep compliance corresponding to the
eight thermodynamically consistent fractional Burgers models formulated in [40] are examined in [41], where
the thermodynamical requirements are narrowed in order to ensure the complete monotonicity of the relaxation
modulus and to ensure that creep compliance is a Bernstein function. The role of Fox function is underlined
in [25, 26] in seeking the responses of fractional constitutive models if stress or strain is assumed to be given.
The experimental data, obtained in creep and stress relaxation experiments on biological tissues, is used for
curve ﬁtting in [21, 28]. In [38], the creep compliances in the steady state regime are reviewed in the case of
integer-order models of viscoelasticity. Considering the inertial eﬀects of the one-dimensional viscoelastic body,
the displacement and stress in stress relaxation and creep tests are analyzed in [8, 9] when material is described
by the distributed-order fractional model, while in [32] the thermodynamically consistent fractional Burgers
models are used.
The qualitative characteristics of relaxation modulus and creep compliance play a crucial role in energy
balance properties of the viscoelastic body, and therefore their explicit form is calculated and used in order to
pose the conditions guaranteeing that the relaxation modulus is a completely monotone function and that creep
compliance is a Bernstein function. Previously mentioned conditions prove to narrow the thermodynamical
restrictions on model parameters appearing in the fractional anti-Zener and Zener models, that are obtained in
[33]. Thethermodynamicalconditionsactuallyallowfortherelaxationmodulusandcreepcompliancetobenon-
monotonic and even oscillatory functions with exponentially decreasing amplitude, which does not necessarily
violate the positivity of stored energy and dissipated power per unit volume.

The use of constitutive models in modeling wave propagation is extensive, where some of the ﬁrst studies
of viscoelastic materials of fractional order is performed in [16, 17]. Damped oscillations and wave propagation
in viscoelastic materials modeled by the Zener, modiﬁed Zener, and modiﬁed Maxwell models is conducted in
[44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. Waves in fractional Zener and distributed type media are investigated in [13, 34] and in
[14, 35], while in [43] wave propagation in the fractional Burgers type material is considered. Multidimensional
generalizations of the fractional Zener model and its application in wave propagation is studied in [1, 20, 42].
Fractional order constitutive equations of viscoelastic media, along with the wave propagation, dispersion, and
attenuation processes are reviewed in [6, 7, 30, 36, 49], while [15] surveys the propagation of acoustic waves in
complex media.
2 Models’ dissipativity properties in the time domain
In order to investigate energy balance properties of the one-dimensional viscoelastic body, the constitutive
equation in the Laplace domain (1) is rewritten either as
~(s) =s~sr(s) ~"(s);or as ~"(s) =s~"cr(s) ~(s); (4)
using the relaxation modulus (2) and creep compliance (3) in the Laplace domain, so that, after performing the
inverse Laplace transform in (4), the constitutive equation in time domain reads either
(t) =d
dt(sr(t)"(t));or"(t) = _"cr(t)(t); (5)
since (sr(t)"(t))jt=0= 0and"(g)
cr="cr(0) = 0. The former holds true if the relaxation modulus tends to
inﬁnityasapower-typefunctionforsmalltime, i.e., if sr(t)Kt ;ast!0with2(0;1), aswellasifstrain
is bounded at zero by "0, since then sr(t)"(t) =Rt
0sr(t0)"(t t0) dt0K"0Rt

ast!0, while the latter holds true, since the glass compliance "(g)

for all considered models.
The power per unit volume, expressed by
P(t) =(t) _"(t); (6)
can be written either in terms of strain as

occurring in (7) and (8) respectively, can be interpreted as the energy per unit volume stored in the viscoelastic
body, taking into account the memory of strain, respectively stress, weighted by the derivative of relaxation
modulus, respectively creep compliance, carrying the information about material properties, while the ﬁrst term
in (9) resembles to the potential energy of the elastic body with Young’s modulus replaced by the relaxation
modulus. On the other hand, the terms

occurring in (7) and (8) respectively, can be interpreted as the dissipated power per unit volume having two
types of contributions: the ﬁrst one being instantaneous and depending on a material dependent positive
and decreasing function  _sr, respectively _"cr, and the second contribution being of hereditary type with
material dependent kernel. The positivity of energy and dissipativity of power is guaranteed by the properties
of the relaxation modulus and creep compliance, namely by requesting the relaxation modulus to be completely
monotonic function, i.e.,
sr(t)>0and ( 1)kdk
dtk_sr(t)60;fort>0; k2N0;
as well as by requesting the creep compliance to be Bernstein’s function, i.e., a positive function with completely
monotonic ﬁrst derivative.
Introducing the energy and dissipated power per unit volume, the power per unit volume can be rewritten
as
P(t) =d
dtW(t) +P(t);
where the ﬁrst term corresponds to the elastic type properties of viscoelastic body, while the second term
corresponds to its properties of viscous type.
The expression (7) for the power per unit volume follows from
P(t) =d

3 Stress relaxation and creep
Relaxation modulus and creep compliance play a crucial role in energy balance properties of viscoelastic body,
since being a completely monotonic function and a Bernstein function respectively, they guarantee the positivity
of the energy stored in viscoelastic body, see (9) and (10), as well as the positivity of the dissipated power, see
(11) and (12). Therefore, the relaxation modulus and creep compliance, given by (2) and (3) in the Laplace
domain, are calculated in the time domain and their properties are investigated, yielding that the relaxation
modulus and creep compliance are completely monotonic and Bernstein functions respectively, if the model
parameters satisfy narrowed thermodynamical restrictions in addition to request that the relaxation modulus
and creep compliance in the Laplace domain (2) and (3) do not have poles, while the character of relaxation
modulus and creep compliance in time domain changes if their counterparts in the Laplace domain have poles.
Namely, in the case of negative real pole there exists an additional term decaying exponentially in time, while
if there exists a pair of complex conjugated poles with negative real part, then there is an additional term
displaying damped oscillatory character.

If the function ";appearing in the creep compliance in the Laplace domain (3), consists of two terms, as it
is the case for models ID.ID, ID.DD+, IID.ID, IDD.DD+, I+ID.ID, and IDD+.DD+, see Table 1, then the creep

where the inequality (45) 3narrows the thermodynamical restriction (169) if 62+  < 1;and it is

Figure 3 presents time evolution of the relaxation modulus for diﬀerent values of model parameters given in
Table 4, so that in the case when model parameters are such that the relaxation modulus in Laplace domain
does not have poles and additionally satisfy narrowed thermodynamical requirements (139) - (141), the relax-
ation modulus from Figure 3a, obtained according to (143) with function (NP)
srgiven by (144), is completely
monotonic, while the complete monotonicity of the relaxation modulus from Figure 3b, obtained according to
29(143) with function (RP)
srgiven by (145), is not guaranteed, although its form is seemingly such, since model
parameters do not satisfy narrowed thermodynamical requirements (139) - (141). Figures 3c and 3d, obtained
according to (143) with function (CCP)
srgiven by (146), present oscillatory relaxation modulus having amplitude
exponentially decreasing in time, displaying the signiﬁcant damping and the negative stress for a certain time
interval, however stress being positive and decreasing to zero for large time. Short and long time behavior of
the relaxation modulus, as obvious from all graphs from Figure 3, is governed by the asymptotic expressions
(149) and (150).

Figure 4 presents time evolution of the creep compliance for diﬀerent values of model parameters, so that the
creep compliance from Figure 4a, obtained according to (154) for the same set of parameters as the relaxation
modulus from Figure 3a, is a Bernstein function, while the creep compliance from Figure 4b, obtained for the
set of parameters in Table 4 guaranteeing that function ~srhas a pair of complex conjugated poles, is obviously
not a Bernstein function, since it is a convex, rather than a concave function. Creep compliance curves from
Figure 4, obtained according to the integral representation (154), perfectly overlap with the creep compliance
curves represented by dots, that are calculated according to the Mittag-Leﬄer representation (155). Finally,
short and long time asymptotic expressions (156) and (157) generate curves that show satisfactory overlapping
with the creep compliance curves.

7 Conclusion
Theanalysisoftheenergybalanceofone-dimensionalviscoelasticbodymodeledbythefractionalanti-Zenerand
Zener models, conducted in Section 2, yields two expressions for the power per unit volume of the viscoelastic
body, where the ﬁrst one is expressed through the strain (7) and the second one is expressed through the stress
(8), both of them containing information about the elastic properties of material, represented by the energy per
unit volume stored in the viscoelastic body (9) and (10), as well as about the viscous properties of the material,
represented by the dissipated power per unit volume (11) and (12).
The positivity of stored energy and dissipated power per unit volume, both of them consisting of the
instantaneous and hereditary terms and depending either on the relaxation modulus and its derivatives, or on
the creep compliance and its derivatives, is guaranteed if the relaxation modulus, respectively creep compliance,
is a completely monotone function, respectively a Bernstein function, and therefore the Laplace transform
method is used in Section 3 in order to obtain the explicit forms of the relaxation modulus sr;expressed
by (15) in terms of functions (NP)
sr; (RP)
sr;and(CCP)
sr;given by (16), (17), and (18), as well as of the creep
compliance "cr, expressed by (27) in terms of functions "(NP)
cr; "(RP)
cr;and"(CCP)
cr;given by (28), (29), and (30),
allowing for the relaxation modulus and creep compliance to be non-monotonic and even oscillatory functions
with exponentially decreasing amplitude. These qualitative properties are due to the existence of poles of the
relaxation modulus and creep compliance in the Laplace domain (2) and (3), examined in Section 6. The
relaxation modulus is proved to be a completely monotone function, as well as the creep compliance proved to
be a Bernstein function, if additional restrictions on model parameters, derived in Section 4 and narrowing the
thermodynamical restrictions on the parameters of fractional anti-Zener and Zener models, listed in Appendix
A, are posed.
In Section 5, the time evolution of relaxation modulus and creep compliance for model I+ID.ID is examined
numerically for the set of parameters from Table 4 and presented in Figures 3 and 4 along with the short and
long time asymptotics, displaying a good agreement. In the case of model I+ID.ID, the relaxation modulus
can be a completely monotone function, as obvious Figure 3a, as well as a function resembling to a completely
monotone function, because of the choice of model parameters not guaranteeing the mentioned property, see
Figure 3b, and moreover an oscillatory function having exponentially decreasing amplitude, see Figures 3c and
3d. On the other hand, the creep compliance can be at most a non-monotonic function, with the possibility to
be a Bernstein function, see Figure 4a, and a function that is positive, monotonically increasing and a convex
rather than a concave function, see Figure 4b. The creep compliance curves, obtained according to the integral
representation (154) because of convergence reasons rather than (152), are compared with the ones obtained by
the Mittag-Leﬄer representation (155) and showed a good agreement.
