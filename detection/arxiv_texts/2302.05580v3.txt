Multipartite entangled states are an es-
sentialresource forsensing, quantumerror
correction, and cryptography. Color cen-
ters in solids are one of the leading plat-
forms for quantum networking due to the
availability of a nuclear spin memory that
can be entangled with the optically active
electronic spin through dynamical decou-
pling sequences. Creating electron-nuclear
entangled states in these systems is a dif-
ficult task as the always-on hyperfine in-
teractions prohibit complete isolation of
the target dynamics from the unwanted
spin bath. While this emergent cross-talk
can be alleviated by prolonging the en-
tanglement generation, the gate durations
quickly exceed coherence times. Here we
show how to prepare high-quality GHZ M-
like states with minimal cross-talk. We in-
troduce the M-tangling power of an evo-
lution operator, which allows us to verify
genuine all-way correlations. Using exper-
imentally measured hyperfine parameters
of an NV center spin in diamond coupled
to carbon-13 lattice spins, we show how to

1 Introduction
Generating and distributing entanglement is one
of the most fundamental yet non-trivial require-
ments for building large-scale quantum networks.
Entanglement is the key ingredient of quan-
tum teleportation, robust quantum communica-
tion protocols, or alternative quantum computa-
tion models such as the one-way quantum com-
puter [1, 2, 3], or fusion-based quantum compu-
tation [4]. In the context of cryptography, en-
tangled states ensure secure communications via
quantumkeydistributionorquantumsecretshar-
ing protocols [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Error detec-
tion [12, 13] and correction [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
schemes are based on the encoding of informa-
tion onto entangled states, such that errors can
be detected or corrected by utilizing correlations
present in entangled states. At the same time,
distributed entanglement increases the sensitiv-
ity and precision of measurements [20, 21].
Defect platforms offer an electronic qubit fea-
turing a spin-photon interface that enables the
generation of distant entanglement [22, 23, 24],
as well as nuclear spins that serve as the long-
lived memories needed for information storage
and buffering. Several protocols based on re-
mote entanglement or entanglement within the
electron-nuclear spin system have already been

tum teleportation [25], quantum error correc-
tion [17, 18, 19], enhanced sensing [26, 27, 28],
and entanglement distillation [29]. The electron-
nuclear spin entanglement is usually realized
through dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences;
large entangled states can be created by applying
consecutive sequences with the appropriate inter-
pulse spacings. By tuning the interpulse spac-
ings, one can select different nuclear spins to par-
ticipate in entangling gates while decoupling the
electron from the remaining always-on coupled
nuclear spin bath [30].
A major issue is that entangled states often
decohere faster than product states [31, 32], so
entanglement must be preserved for long enough
times to complete quantum information tasks.
Additionally, in defect platforms, the unwanted
spin bath sets a lower bound on the duration of
entangling gates, which should be long enough
to suppress unwanted interactions that lower the
quality of target entangled states. Despite this
challenge, generation of electron-nuclear entan-
gled states has been realized experimentally in
NV [33], in SiV centers in diamond [34, 35], and
in SiC defects [36]. In particular, Bradley et al.
demonstrated experimentally in an NV defect in
diamond electron-nuclear GHZ states involving
up to 7 qubits [33] by combining DD sequences
with direct RF driving of the nuclear spins, ac-
companied by refocusing pulses to extend the en-
tanglement lifetime. This direct driving was nec-
essary to improve the selective coupling of indi-
vidual nuclear spins. Although successful, this
method introduces experimental overhead and
heating of the sample due to the direct RF driv-
ing of the nuclei, potentially creating scalability
issues. Another problem is that as the number
of parties contributing to the entangled state in-
creases, a larger gate count and longer sequences
are needed, exacerbating dephasing. Failure to
provide optimal isolation from unwanted nuclei
further deteriorates the electron-nuclear entan-
gled states. Therefore, a more efficient approach
to generating electron-nuclear spin entanglement
withintimeconstraintsandverifyingitsexistence
is necessary for large-scale applications.
Inthispaper,weaddressthesechallengesbyin-
troducing a framework for preparing high-quality
GHZ states of up to 10 qubits within time con-
straints. Using experimental parameters froma 27 nuclear spin register well-characterized by
Taminiau et al.[37], we show how to improve
sequential entanglement generation methods by
minimizing the cross-talk induced by the un-
wanted nuclear spin bath. We find that it is
possible to prepare GHZ-like states with max-
imal all-way correlations in excess of 95%and
gate errors lower than 0.05 %due to residual en-
tanglement with unwanted nuclei. We show how
to prepare GHZ-like states with single-shot op-
erations, reducing the gate times at least two-
fold compared to the sequential scheme while of-
fering decoupling capabilities comparable to the
latter. We present a closed-form expression for
theM-tangling power of the evolution operator
and use this to develop a method for verifying
genuine multipartite entanglement. Remarkably,
this metric depends only on two-qubit Makhlin
invariantsandiscloselyrelatedtotheone-tangles
we introduced in Ref. [38]. This simplification
allows us to systematically determine the DD se-
quences that maximize all-way correlations as de-
siredforgeneratingmultipartiteentangledstates.
Further, we analyze the entanglement of mixed
electron-nuclear states and derive a non-unitary
M-tangling power that captures residual entan-
glement links arising from unwanted nuclei. We
incorporate electronic dephasing errors into the
M-tangling power and derive a simple closed-
form expression. Finally, we study the impact of
pulse control errors on the M-way correlations.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we
discuss methods for generating electron-nuclear
spin entangled states using DD sequences. In
Sec. 3, we introduce the M-tangling power of
an evolution operator. In Sec. 4, we show how
to prepare GHZ M-like states through sequential
or single-shot entanglement protocols. In Sec. 5,
we quantify the entanglement of electron-nuclear
mixed states by tracing out unwanted spins. In
Sec. 6, we study the non-unitary M-tangling
power of the electron-nuclear target subspace,
which encodes correlations arising from the en-
tire electron-nuclear system. Finally, in Sec. 7
we study the effect of electronic dephasing errors
as well as pulse control errors on the M-tangling
power.

2 Establishing electron-nuclear entan-
glement
One way to generate electron-nuclear entangle-
ment is through DD sequences, which are trains
ofœÄ-pulses applied on the electron spin that are
interleaved by free evolution periods. These se-
quences are constructed by concatenating a basic
œÄ-pulse unit of time ta certain number of iter-
ations,N. Well-known examples are the Carr-
Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) [39, 40, 41, 42]
and Uhrig (UDD) [43, 44] sequences, which
have been used experimentally for example in
Refs. [45, 30, 17, 33, 46], or proposed for defects
in Ref. [47]. In the defect-nuclear spin system,
DD sequences serve a two-fold purpose; i) they
average out the interactions between the electron
and unwanted nuclei and, ii) under so-called reso-
nance conditions, they selectively entangle a tar-
get nuclear spin with the electron [30]. These
resonances correspond to specific values of t, and
they are generally distinct for each nuclear spin,
as they depend on the hyperfine (HF) parameters
of each nucleus. By composing consecutive se-
quenceswithdifferentparameters(i.e., unittimes
tand iterations N), we can thus create entangle-
ment between the electron and multiple nuclei.
We refer to this standard experimental approach
of entangling one nuclear spin at a time with the
electron as ‚Äúsequential". In Ref. [38], we showed
that alternatively single-shot operations can be
used to entangle the electron with a subset of nu-
clei from the register, significantly reducing gatetimes compared to the sequential approach. Fig-
ure 1 summarizes the two approaches to generat-
ing electron-nuclear entanglement.
Figure 1(a) depicts the multi-spin scheme im-
plemented by a single-shot entangling opera-
tion, and Fig. 1(b) shows the sequential scheme
which requires M‚àí1entangling gates to pre-
pare GHZ M-like states. The M‚àí1entangling
gates are realized by composing sequences of dif-
ferent interpulse spacings and iterations of the
unit, such that a different nuclear spin is selected
from the register based on the resonance condi-
tion.
GHZMstates are created by initializing the
electron in the|+‚ü©state, polarizing the nuclear
spins in the|0‚ü©state [48, 17], and then perform-
ing electron-nuclear entangling gates via DD se-
quences. Probabilistic (deterministic) initializa-
tion of the nuclear spins in |0‚ü©can be achieved
through measurement-based (SWAP-based) ini-
tialization [49]. After state initialization, one can
performaDDsequencetogenerateentanglement.
Setting the sequence unit time tto be a nuclear
spin resonance time forces that nuclear spin to
rotate along an axis conditioned on the electron
spin state. If the axes are anti-parallel and along
the¬±xdirection, and the unit is iterated an ap-
propriate number of times, the nuclear spin can
accumulate a rotation angle of œï=œÄ/2, real-
izing a CR x(¬±œÄ/2)electron-nuclear entangling
gate [30]. Repeating this process by changing the
unit timetand iterations Nof the subsequent se-
quence (and assuming the k-th target spin is ro-

For example, if all the gates are CR x(œÄ/2), then
the resulting state is (|0‚ü©|‚àíy‚ü©‚äók+|1‚ü©|y‚ü©‚äók)/‚àö
2.
This is the idea behind the sequential entangle-
ment protocol. The multi-spin entanglement pro-
tocol produces a more complicated state since the
electron-nuclear evolution now becomes a CR xz
gate (see Ref. [38]), but the resulting state is still
locally equivalent to GHZ M. In this latter setup,
multiple nuclei are simultaneously entangled with
the electron via a single-shot operation.
Quantifying the quality of GHZ M-like states
using a fidelity overlap is computationally costly
since we would need to optimize over local gates.
This optimization becomes more difficult for
larger entangled states. In the following section,
we introduce an entanglement metric that allows
us to quantify genuine all-way correlations in an
arbitrarily large electron-nuclear spin system, us-
ingonlytheinformationoftheevolutionoperator
generated by œÄ-sequences. With this analysis we
are able to translate the M-tangling capability of
such an evolution operator irrespective of the to-
tal system size, into simple spin-spin correlation
metrics between the central spin and each of the
M‚àí1nuclear spins. Our analysis throughout the
paper is completely general and is not restricted
by the choice of DD sequence or by the choice of
the defect system. It is further generically valid
for any type of nuclear spins present in the regis-
ter (provided they have spin I= 1/2). The code
used to simulate all our following results can be
found in [50].
3M-tangling power
Genuine multipartite entanglement of GHZ M-
like states can be verified with metrics such
as entanglement witnesses [51, 52, 53], concen-
tratable entanglement [54], or the so-called M-
tangles [55, 56, 57]. We choose to work with thelatter, which are usually defined in terms of a
state vector (or, more generally, a density opera-
tor). TheM-tangles,œÑM(|œà‚ü©)‚àà[0,1], distinguish
the GHZ entanglement class from other entangle-
ment classes. For example, the three-tangle satu-
rates to 1 for the GHZ 3state, whereas it vanishes
for the|W‚ü©= 1/‚àö
3(|100‚ü©+|010‚ü©+|001‚ü©)state.
TheM-tangles are invariant under permutations
of the qubits and SLOCC, and are entanglement
monotones1[58]. Since they are defined based on
a state vector, their calculation requires that we
make an assumption about the initial state of the
register, which is then evolved under the œÄ-pulse
sequence. We circumvent this issue by focusing
instead on the capability of a gate to saturate all-
way correlations and thus prepare states locally
equivalent to GHZ M.
We introduce the M-tangling power of a uni-
tary, which we define to be the average of the M-
tangleœµp,M(U) :=‚ü®œÑM(UœÅ0U‚Ä†)‚ü©, over all initial
productstates, œÅ0. Theformulasof M-tanglesex-
pressed in terms of the state vector can be found
in Appendix A.1 and in Refs. [55, 57, 56].
In our system, the total evolution operator (of
the electron and M‚àí1nuclear spins) produced
by DD sequences has the form:

evolution is controlled only on the electron, we
find that we can compactly express the M-tangle
of a given state as [see Appendix A.2]:

tricesœÅobtained by any arbitrary U, whereas
for oddM, Eq. (3) holds strictly for states ob-
tained by CR-evolutions. (We verified this nu-
merically, comparing with the exact expressions
ofœÑMthat hold for states obtained by arbitrary
evolutions.) By averaging Eq. (3) over all prod-
uct initial states, we prove that the M-tangling
power of an operator Uhas the simple expression
[Appendix A.2]:

exact for any arbitrary U(M), forMeven and

type evolution operators of the form of Eq. (2).
The simple structure of CR-type evolution oper-
ators generated by œÄ-sequences allows us to de-
rive analytically a closed-form expression for the
M-tangling power for an arbitrarily large nuclear
spin register coupled to the electron. In Ap-
pendix A.3, we prove that the M-tangling power
of the operator Uof Eq. (2), is given by:

to the bipartition entangling power of the nuclear
spin with the remaining register, i.e., the nuclear
one-tangle given by œµnuclear
p = 2/9(1‚àíG1)[38].The nuclear one-tangle is a faithful metric of se-
lectivity; its minimization ensures that the spin is
decoupled from the register, while its maximiza-
tion implies that the particular spin attains max-
imal correlations with the register.
The remarkable simplicity of Eq. (6) allows
us to check whether a controlled unitary of the
form of Eq. (2) is capable of preparing GHZ M-
like states. Saturating the bounds of all-way cor-
relations between the electronic defect and the
nuclear register translates into minimizing G1
(or, equivalently maximizing œµnuclear
p) of the nu-
clei that will be part of the GHZ state, and
implies that the maximum M-tangling power is
[d/(d+ 1)]M.
At this point, we should mention a caveat
of theM-tangle metric. In Ref. [56] it was
mentioned that the four-tangle cannot discrim-
inate the entanglement of a GHZ 4-like state from
that of bi-separable maximally entangled states,
e.g.,|Œ¶+‚ü©‚äó2, where|Œ¶+‚ü©is one of the four
Bell states; in both cases the four-tangle is 1.
Similarly,œÑ6(|GHZ 6‚ü©) = 1 = œÑ6(|Œ¶+‚ü©‚äó3), but
œÑ6(|GHZ 3‚ü©‚äó2) = 0. Analogously, the even M-
tangle cannot discriminate the entanglement of
a GHZMstate from the entanglement of M/2
copies of two-qubit maximally entangled states
|Bell‚ü©‚äóM/2(see also Ref. [60]). Nevertheless, in
our system we have the extra condition that G1
of allM‚àí1nuclei should be minimized to satu-
rate all-way correlations. Hence, if we fail to min-
imize at least one out of the M‚àí1{G1}quan-
tities, we know that the evolution operator will
never be able to prepare genuine multipartite en-
tanglement between all Mparties. Another way
to understand this is to consider the example of
4 qubits, and the entangling gate CR x(œÄ/2)‚äó3=
œÉ00‚äó3
i=1Rx(œÄ/2) +œÉ11‚äó3
i=1Rx(‚àíœÄ/2). If we act
with CRx(œÄ/2)‚äó3on arbtirary initial states, we
can at most prepare a GHZ 4-like state, but we
will never be able to prepare two individual Bell
pairs, since correlations are constrained to be dis-
tributed among all parties connected by the elec-
tron (since we are dealing with a central spin type
system). Similar statements hold for the multi-
spin method that utilizes CR xzgates. There-
fore, we can safely use the M-tangle metrics to
detect genuine multipartite electron-nuclear (and
nuclear-nuclear) spin entanglement.
Let us further comment that the M-tangling
power is derived by averaging over all product

dynamics of Ucan saturate the all-way correla-
tions of pure product states. No conclusion can
be made, however, if one has a statistical mixture
of such states (i.e., a mixed state).
In the following section, we show how to op-
timize the sequential or multi-spin schemes and
guide the selection of nuclei from the register to
generate genuine all-way correlations within time
constraints.

4.1 Sequential scheme for GHZ 3states
WefirstbeginwiththetaskofgeneratingGHZ M-
like states using the sequential scheme, which re-
quiresM‚àí1consecutive gates. Hereafter, we
refer to the collection of M‚àí1entangling gates
as the composite evolution.
Under this scheme, to entangle the nuclei with
the electron, we need to ensure that during each
evolution we rotate conditionally only one par-
ticular nuclear spin, meaning we maximize its
one-tangle. At the same time, all other nuclear
one-tangles should be minimal in each evolution,
so that we suppress cross-talk arising from the
nuclear spin bath. The procedure of identifying
optimal nuclear spin candidates and sequence pa-
rameters is shown in Fig. 2 and explained in moredetail in Appendix G. Depending on the size of
the GHZ state, we set different tolerances for un-
wanted/target one-tangles, and gate time restric-
tions within T‚àó
2of the nuclei (see Table 2 of Ap-
pendix G). At the end of this procedure, we are
left with different options for selectively entan-
gling a single nuclear spin with the electron.
After identifying the optimal sequence param-
eters and nuclear spin candidates, we compose
theM‚àí1entangling gates and create a ‚Äúcase‚Äù of
a composite evolution operator, from which we
can extract the Makhlin invariants G1associated
with the evolution of each nuclear spin. This pro-
cess allows us to calculate the M-tangling power
of the composite gate (using Eq. (6)) and verify
if it can prepare genuine multipartite entangle-
ment. Further, as we showed in Ref. [38], we can
analytically calculate the induced gate error due
to residual entanglement links with the unwanted
nuclei. This unresolved entanglement could make
the target gate deviate from the ideal evolution,
which we take to be the composite M‚àí1en-
tangling operations in the absence of unwanted
spins; minimization of this gate error thus en-
sures a better quality of the GHZ-like states that
we produce.
We start with the simplest case of generat-
ing GHZ 3-like states using the sequential scheme.
Throughout the rest of the paper, we focus on the
CPMG sequence (t/4‚àíœÄ‚àít/2‚àíœÄ‚àít/4)N, where
tis the unit time, œÄrepresents a œÄ-pulse, and N
is the number of iterations of the basic unit. For
concreteness, we consider an NV center in dia-
mond and define the qubit states of the electron
to be|0‚ü© ‚â° |ms= 0‚ü©and|1‚ü© ‚â° |ms=‚àí1‚ü©.
We further use the hyperfine parameters of the
13C nuclear spins from the 27 nuclear spin reg-
ister characterized by the Taminiau group [37],
and following their conventions we label the nu-
clear spins as C jwithj‚àà[1,27]. Despite these
choices, the analysis that follows is general and
valid for any œÄ-sequence or electronic defect in
diamond or SiC, and for nuclei with spin I= 1/2
(e.g.,13C in diamond,13C and29Si in silicon car-
bide).
In Fig. 3(a), we show the nuclear one-tangles
(scaled by the maximum value of 2/9) for 39 dif-
ferent composite evolutions (labeled as ‚Äúcases‚Äù)
that can prepare GHZ 3-like states. Each realiza-
tion corresponds to a unique nuclear spin com-

text above the bars indicates which13C nuclear
spins are involved). The first (second) bar of
each case corresponds to the one-tangle of the
first (second) target nuclear spin at the end of
the composite evolution of two entangling gates.
Each entangling gate is implemened using an op-
timal unit time tof the sequence and an optimal
numberNof iterations of the unit. Since we op-
timizetclose to the resonance time of the respec-
tive nuclear spin, the dot product of the nuclear
axes is n0¬∑n1‚âà‚àí1. Thus, the maximization of
the first (second) one-tangle happens when the
first (second) nuclear spin rotates by œï=œÄ/2
[see Eq. (7)], during the first (second) evolution.
(NotethatforeachCPMGevolutionitholdsthat
œï0=œï1‚â°œï, see also Ref. [38]).
The composition of the two entangling opera-
tions gives rise to total rotation angles œï0Ã∏=œï1
for each nuclear spin. The nuclear rotation an-
glesœï:=œï0are shown in Fig. 3(b), and the
dot products of the rotation axes are depicted
in Fig. 3(c). Due to the composite evolution, the
total nuclear rotation angles deviate from œÄ/2,
and the rotation axes are no longer anti-parallel
for all cases. However, as we noted in Ref. [38],G1can be minimized as long as n0¬∑n1‚â§0. Due
to the unwanted one-tangle tolerances we impose,
we ensure that only one out of the M‚àí1gates
will conditionally rotate the target spin we in-
tend to entangle with the electron. The remain-
ing evolutions will approximately leave the en-
tanglement of that specific spin with the elec-
tron intact. For example, the first (second) tar-
get spin will evolve approximately trivially (i.e.,
in an unconditional manner) during the second
(first) evolution, hence preserving the high en-
tanglement between all parties at the end of all
the gates. This behavior is confirmed in Fig. 3(d)
where we show the M-tangling power (scaled by
[d/(d+ 1)]M, which is higher than 0.99 across all
different cases. In Fig. 3(e), we further show the
total gate time, which we have restricted to less
than 2 ms so that we are within the coherence
times of the nuclei ( T‚àó
2‚àà[3,17]ms; see Ref. [61]).
Further, in Fig. 3(f), we show the gate error due
to residual entanglement of the target subspace
with unwanted nuclei. We note that for vari-
ous realizations, the gate fidelity can exceed 95 %
(e.g., cases ‚Äú2‚Äù, ‚Äú7‚Äù, ‚Äú19‚Äù, ‚Äú23‚Äù,‚Äú30‚Äù, ‚Äú37‚Äù), imply-
ing small levels of cross-talk with the remaining

4.2 Multi-spin scheme for GHZ 3states
Next, we proceed with the multi-spin scheme,
which can prepare GHZ 3-like states with a single-
shot entangling operation. To identify optimal
nuclearspincandidatesandsequenceparameters,
we follow a slightly different procedure, shown in
Fig. 2 and explained more in Appendix G. In this
case, we require that two nuclear one-tangles are
maximized for the same sequence parameters and
under the gate time restriction of 2 ms. At the
same time, we require small values of unwanted
one-tangles to minimize the cross-talk with the
remaining nuclear spin bath. We summarize the
results of this method in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4(a), we
show the one-tangles of two nuclei that are max-
imized by a single-shot gate for 15 different DD
sequences. To accept these cases as ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù,
we require that the target one-tangles are greater
than a threshold, here set to 0.9. Figure 4(b)
shows the nuclear rotation angles, and Fig. 4(c)
shows the dot products of the nuclear rotation
axes for each case. Since now the sequence unit
time will not in principle coincide with the res-
onance of both target spins (since their HF pa-
rameters are distinct), the nuclear rotation axes
will not be anti-parallel for both nuclei. However,
when n0¬∑n1‚â§0for a particular nuclear spin,
then if it is also rotated by the appropriate angle,
the one-tangle can be maximal (see for example
cases ‚Äú2‚Äù, ‚Äú7‚Äù, ‚Äú8‚Äù, ‚Äú11‚Äù and Ref. [38] for a more
detailed explanation). Thus, the feature of non-
antiparallel axes can be compensated by rotating
thenuclearspinsbyanglesthatdeviatefrom œÄ/2.
On the other hand, if n0¬∑n1>0,G1cannot go
to 0, and the one-tangle can never be 1 (see case
‚Äú4‚Äù, for nuclear spin C5). In Fig. 4(d) we show
theM-tangling power (scaled by [d/(d+ 1)]M)
of the multi-spin gate. As expected, the M-
tangling power saturates to 1 when the nuclear
one-tangles are also maximal. In Fig. 4(e), we
show the gate time of the multi-spin operation,
and in Figure 4(f), the gate error. We note that
for various cases, the multi-spin gate duration is
at least two times shorter (see for example, cases
‚Äú4‚Äù, ‚Äú11‚Äù, ‚Äú22‚Äù ) compared to the sequential one.
Thus, the multi-spin gates can be equally reliable
as the sequential gates, but with the additional
advantage of being significantly faster compared
to the latter.4.3 Generating GHZ Mstates
We can use similar ideas to extend the size of the
GHZM-like states. In Fig. 5(a), we show the M-
tangling power of composite evolutions that can
prepare GHZ M-like states up to M= 10qubits.
The nuclear one-tangles for all different realiza-
tions are provided in Appendix H. Figure 5(b)
shows the gate error of the composite evolution
due to the presence of the remaining 27‚àí(M‚àí1)
nuclear spins, whereas Fig. 5(c) shows the total
gate time of the composite sequences. As the size
of the GHZ-like states increases, it becomes more
difficult to eliminate the cross-talk between the
target nuclei since we need to ensure that only
one out of the M‚àí1evolutions rotates condi-
tionally one of the M‚àí1target nuclei. However,
we still find acceptable cases that can prepare up
to GHZ 10-like states with M-tangling power over
0.95. The infidelity tends to increase as we per-
form more entangling gates because it becomes
more likely that at least one of the M‚àí1en-
tangling operators will induce cross-talk between
the target subspace and the remaining nuclear
spin bath. However, it is still possible to create
GHZ 6-like states within ‚àº2ms, and even GHZ 9-
or GHZ 10-like states within 4ms, a significant
improvement compared to gate times reported in
Ref. [33], which could be as high as 2.371 ms for
controlling only a single nuclear spin.
We also study the possibility of creating
GHZM-like states for M > 3via the multi-spin
scheme. In principle, due to the more constrained
optimization that requires the simultaneous max-
imization of M‚àí1nuclear one-tangles, we expect
that we will find fewer acceptable cases that re-
spect the bounds we set for target/unwanted one-
tangles. In Fig. 6(a), we show the nuclear one-
tangles for various cases of single-shot entangling
operations, which can create up to GHZ 9-like
states. Figure 6(b) shows the M-tangling power
of the single-shot gate, whereas Fig. 6(c) shows
the gate error. We note that the infidelity can
in principle be less than 0.1, but the M-tangling
power is not high enough in all cases, due to im-
perfect entanglement between target nuclei and
the electron.
Figure 6(d) shows the gate time of the multi-
spin operation. Once again, the gates are signifi-
cantly faster compared to the sequential scheme.

multi-spin operations follow a different trend. To
understand this, note that the sequential scheme
requires higher-order resonances (i.e., longer unit
times) to suppress unintended couplings with un-
wanted nuclei. Higher-order resonances are also
neededtoensurethatonlyonetargetnuclearspin
is rotated conditionally by each of the M‚àí1se-
quential gates. Thus, increasing the GHZ size
makes the requirement to resort to higher-order
sequences, in principle, more stringent. On the
other hand, increasing the size of the GHZ M-like
state in the multi-spin protocol means that we
need to gradually reducehow well we decouple
the electron from the spin bath and allow inter-
actions of the electron with increasingly more nu-
clear spins. In contrast to the sequential scheme,
wethusneedtoshortentheunittime, whichgives
usacceptablecasesofrealizingGHZ M-likestates.
Of course, the duration of the single-shot gate
also depends on the number of times, N, we re-
peat the unit and on the constraints we impose
on the target all-way correlations and unwanted
nuclear one-tangles. In principle, a shorter ba-
sic unit can lead to faster operations. For exam-
ple, it is remarkable that multi-partite entangled
states can be prepared within 1 ms or even faster
with only one entangling gate (see for example,
the case of the GHZ 8-like state). Experimentally,
depending on the nuclear HF parameters, this
method could be highly beneficial for preparing
entangled states involving nuclear spin clusters
fast, whereas the entanglement could be boosted
using distillation protocols [29].
Overall, both the sequential and multi-spin
protocols can generate high-quality GHZ M-like
states with reasonable gate times. Our formal-
ism based on the M-tangling power allows us to
identify optimal scenarios of preparing entangled
states with minimal cross-talk. Interestingly, a
hybrid entanglement generation scheme involving
both single-shot and sequential gates could offer
a more realistic path to scalability by drastically
reducingthenumberofentanglingoperationsand
gate times.
5 Entanglement of mixed states
So far we have made no assumption about the
initial state of the system and focused instead
on the capability of the gates to produce entan-gled states. We have used the gate error due
to residual entanglement links and the unwanted
nuclear one-tangles as a metric of mixedness in
the GHZM-like states prepared by DD sequences.
We now work with a density matrix for the total
system and inspect the entanglement of a target
subspace after we trace out the unwanted nuclear
spins. This partial trace operation will result, in
general, in a mixed state for the target subspace,
for which we cannot use directly the M-tangles
that are defined for pure states.
In the case of mixed states, the M-tangles
are calculated via so-called convex roof construc-
tions [55, 62]:
œÑM(œÅ) =min/summationdisplay
ipiœÑ(|œài‚ü©), (8)
where the minimum is taken over all ensembles
with probabilities piand pure states|œài‚ü©that re-
construct the mixed state density operator. The
ensemble that gives the minimum value of the
tangle is known as optimal. Such convex roof
extensions are necessary to ensure an entangle-
ment monotone, but since the minimum of a
sum of convex functions is not always convex, we
need to take the convex hull of Eq. (8) (see also
Refs. [63, 62]).
Finding the optimal ensemble is a non-trivial
task as it entails searching over all possible de-
compositions of the mixed state. This task be-
comes even harder when the rank of the reduced
density matrix is large. However, for our prob-
lem, we find that starting from an arbitrary pure
stateofthetotalsystemandtracingoutanynum-
ber of nuclei, the maximum rank of the reduced
density matrix is 2. This is due to the form of
the total evolution operator, which can produce
at most GHZ M-like states (if extra single-qubit
gates are not allowed) given the appropriate ini-
tial state. Further, the maximum rank proves
that the creation of |W‚ü©-like states is impossi-
ble if one allows only entangling gates generated
by DD sequences. In Appendix I we derive the
eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the density ma-
trix, of which two are nonzero, provided the elec-
tron starts from a superposition of |0‚ü©and|1‚ü©.
The analytical expression of the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix
of the target subspace allows us to find the opti-
mal ensemble that minimizes the M-tangle of the
mixed state. This can be done using the meth-
ods developed in Ref. [62]. The first step is to di-
Accepted in Quantum2024-02-28, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 11agonalize the reduced density matrix of the sys-
tem. Based on the eigendecomposition we can
then construct the trial state:
|œàtrial‚ü©=/radicalÔ£¨ig
Œª+|v+‚ü©‚àíeiœá/radicalÔ£¨ig
1‚àíŒª+|v‚àí‚ü©,(9)
where|v¬±‚ü©are the eigenvectors of the rank-2
mixed state and Œª¬±the two nonzero eigenvalues.
Since any ensemble can be obtained by acting
with unitaries on the diagonalized reduced den-
sity matrix, minimizing the entanglement of the
trial state by varying the angle œáimplies that we
obtain the entanglement of the optimal ensemble
that reconstructs the mixed state. The angle œá
controls the relative phase of the eigenvectors.
Our system consists of 28 qubits, so simulating
the total density matrix is computationally hard.
The fact that we obtain the reduced density ma-
trix analytically [see Appendix I] allows us to find
the impact of the unwanted spins on the target
subspace. Working with a density matrix neces-
sitates that we specify the system‚Äôs initial state.
In the literature, it is often assumed that the nu-
clear spin bath starts from the maximally mixed
state. This assumption, however, would result
in maximal entanglement in the target subspace
(provided we perform close to perfect gates and
once the electron-nuclear target register is pu-
rified) free from cross-talk, since the maximally
mixed state of the unwanted spins would remain
invariant under any unitary evolution. This is far
from true since the target subspace suffers from
cross-talk from unwanted nuclei introduced by
the entangling gates. On the other hand, consid-
ering a pure state for the entire electron-nuclear
register is again unrealistic, but we choose this
convention to find how classical correlations due
to the partial trace operation manifest in the tar-
get subspace.
For the following analysis, we will use the 39
caseswefoundforcreatingGHZ 3-likestates(gen-
eralization to larger dimension of the target sub-
space is straightforward) from Sec. 4 via the se-
quential scheme. We further use the analytical
expression of the three-tangle, first introduced in
Ref. [55]. To prepare an entangled state with
genuine all-way correlations, we need to find the
appropriate initial state for the target subspace,
upon which we act with the entangling oper-
ations. In most cases, this state needs to be
|+‚ü©|0‚ü©‚äóM‚àí1. (Recall that the CR x(œÄ/2)gates
are locally equivalent to CNOT.) If this initialstate does not give rise to a three-tangle of at
least 0.95, we then optimize over the initial three-
qubit state (we assume a sampling of 0.05œÄfor
Œ∏‚àà[0,œÄ]and0.1œÄforŒ≥‚àà[0,2œÄ]for each qubit
state|Œæ‚ü©= cos(Œ∏/2)|0‚ü©+eiŒ≥sin(Œ∏/2)|1‚ü©). It is
thus possible that other initial states might give
slightly larger three-tangles than the ones we will
show later on. We further assume that the initial
state of the bath is |0‚ü©‚äó27‚àí(M‚àí1).
We begin with the following setup. In Sec. 4,
we found 39 cases of preparing GHZ 3-like states
using the sequential scheme, via the composition
of two consecutive DD sequences. The composite
evolution rotates both target and unwanted nu-
clei. Some unwanted spins might evolve slightly
conditionally on the electron. Thus, we need to
update the initial state of all spins under the
composite evolution. Using the analytical expres-
sion of the reduced density matrix, we obtain its
eigenvalues and eigenvectors and arrange the 39
cases in increasing value of the largest eigenvalue,
p=Œª+.
(a)(b)

subspace ignoring unwanted nuclei (purple), and three-
tangle of either eigenvector (blue) of the mixed state for
each of the 39 cases of Fig. 3. The 39 cases are sorted
in terms of largest eigenvalue, Œª+=p, shown along the
x-axis. (b) Three-tangle of the mixed electron-nuclear
state (red), obtained by minimizing the entanglement of
the trial state of Eq. (9) for each value of p. The dashed
line shows the convex hull.
In Fig. 7(a), we show the three-tangle of the
pure state prepared using the composite evolu-
tions of Fig. 3 by ignoring the presence of un-
wanted nuclei. Using the three-tangle, we ver-
ify that all-way correlations are maximal across
all cases, as expected based on the fact that we
Accepted in Quantum2024-02-28, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 12approximately saturated the M-tangling power
(and we also use the appropriate three-qubit ini-
tial state). We further show the three-tangle of
the two eigenvectors, |v¬±‚ü©, as a function of the
largest eigenvalue p, obtained by diagonalizing
the mixed state (after tracing out unwanted nu-
clei). The three-tangle of |v+‚ü©coincides with
the three-tangle of |v‚àí‚ü©, which means that the
unwanted bath creates a mixture of two terms,
which both have the same M-way entanglement
and are GHZ 3-like states. Another feature we
observe is that the all-way correlations of the
eigenvectors|v¬±‚ü©coincide with those of the pure
GHZ 3-likestateofthetargetelectron-nuclearreg-
ister. Hence, tracing out the unwanted spins
makes the reduced state classically correlated,
but the amount of entanglement in each term of
the mixed state is unaffected.
In Fig. 7(b), we then use the two eigenvectors
to build the trial state and find the minimum of
the three-tangle as we vary œáfor each value of
p. Since we are tracing out 25 unwanted nuclei,
we see that the entanglement of the mixed state
reduces substantially. One simple way to under-
stand this feature is to think of a trial (pure) two-
qubit state which is a superposition of two Bell
states. When we have the equal superposition,
the two-qubit concurrence goes to 0, whereas for
different weights between the two terms, the con-
currence is 0< C (|œà‚ü©)‚â§1. A similar thing
happens here, with the difference that the su-
perposition terms are two GHZ 3-like states. In
Appendix J, we show that the three-tangle of the
superposition of two orthogonal GHZ 3states is
muchmoresensitivecomparedtotheconcurrence
of the superposition of two orthogonal Bell states
for the two-qubit case. Even for large values of p
(i.e.p= 0.9)theminimumthree-tangleisaround
‚àº0.64for the GHZ 3mixture compared to the
minimum concurrence which is ‚àº0.8for the Bell
mixture. In Fig. 7(b), we further show the convex
hull of the minimum value of the three-tangle. In
the scenario we are studying, the minimum value
of the three-tangle is not convex since the pure
state of the target subspace does not have per-
fect correlations due to slightly imperfect gates
(i.e., gates that cause over- or under-rotation of
the nuclei). If the gates create perfect all-way
entanglement then both eigenvectors are perfect
GHZ 3-like states, and the minimum of the three-
tangle is convex in terms of p, and is given byœÑmin(p) = (1‚àí2p)2(see Appendix J).
We should further comment that our results
depend highly on the initial state of the system.
Since the evolution is conditional on the electron,
if the initial state of the unwanted spins is not the
appropriate one to generate the maximum possi-
ble entanglement, cross-talk will be suppressed.
Also, as the system‚Äôs initial state is generically
mixed, the rank of the reduced density matrix
after tracing out unwanted nuclei will be larger
than 2. However, the simple model we assumed
in this section captures qualitatively how the M-
way entanglement changes as the target subspace
becomes more mixed, as a result of residual en-
tanglement with unwanted nuclei.
In the next section, we show another way
of understanding the unwanted residual entan-
glement in terms of the non-unitary entangling
power of the entire quantum channel, where now
the partial trace operation is translated into the
operator-sum representation [64].
6 Non-unitary entangling power
An alternative way to include the impact of un-
wanted nuclei on the target subspace is to use the
Kraus operators associated with the partial trace
channel. In Ref. [38], we derived the Kraus oper-
ators for an arbitrary number of nuclei coupled to
a single electron spin. Here, we use this result to
derivetheM-tanglingpoweroftheevolutionthat
the target system undergoes due to the presence
of the unwanted nuclei. Because this is a gener-
alization for non-unitary dynamics, we will refer
to this metric for brevity as the non-unitary M-
tangling power.
The density matrix of the total system evolves
under the unitary Ugiven by Eq. (2). If we
trace out the unwanted nuclei, the target sub-
space evolves under the quantum channel E(œÅ) =/summationtext2L‚àíK‚àí1

The equality is satisfied when the unwanted sub-
space evolves trivially (i.e., irrespective of the
electron‚Äôs state), in which case it holds that
G(j)
1= 1andW(j)= 0,‚àÄj. Therefore, whenever
œµp,M(E)< œµp,M(U), we know that the unwanted
spin bath possesses nonzero correlations with the
target subspace. This is an alternative way to see
that the entanglement of the mixed state is lower
compared to the pure case, a feature we already
observed in Sec. 5.

panels, the dark blue bars show the unitary M-tangling
power, the pink bars the non-unitary M-tangling power,
whereas the green bars show an approximation of the
latter.The remarkable simplicity of Eq. (11) allows
us to obtain full information of the entanglement
distribution within the electron-nuclear register,
irrespective of the total number of qubits in the
system, or number of nuclear spins we are trac-
ing out. Using œµp,M(E), we can find how well
the gate we design saturates the M-way cor-
relations of the target subspace, given the fact
that there might be residual unwanted correla-
tions linking the target subspace with unwanted
spins; those unwanted correlations are encoded
in the Kraus operators. An extra advantage of
this approach is that we never need to assume
an initial state of the electron-nuclear register, as
we did for example in Sec. 5. To compare the
non-unitary M-tangling power against œµp,M(U),
we consider as an example the optimal cases we
identified for preparing GHZ 4-like states from
Sec. 4 for either the sequential or the multi-spin
schemes. The results for the sequential scheme
are shown in Fig. 8(a). The dark blue bars show
the unitary M-tangling power across 29 realiza-
tions, and the pink bars show the non-unitary M-
tangling power. As expected, œµp,M(E)is lower in
all cases due to unresolved crosstalk, and this de-
viation is enhanced when the gate error is larger
[see Fig. 5(b)]. A similar feature is observed
in Fig. 8(b) for the 7 cases of preparing GHZ 4-
like states using the multi-spin scheme. Specifi-
cally, for case ‚Äú5‚Äù, for which we found the lowest
gate error emerging from residual entanglement
across the 7 cases [see Fig. 6(b)], the non-unitary
M-tangling power is closer to the unitary one.
Hence, this verifies our previous observation that
the mixed electron-nuclear states we create in the
target subspace remain GHZ M-like, but their en-
tanglement is reduced whenever correlations be-
tween the target subspace and the unwanted spin
bath are present.
In Fig. 8, we also display with green bars an
approximate expression for œµp,M(E), where we set
W(j)= 0,‚àÄj. We note that the approximate ex-
pression agrees very well with the exact expres-
sion ofœµp,M(E).
Finally, let us discuss the computational com-
plexity related to the various entanglement met-
rics we introduced. The calculation of the G1
Makhlin invariants and hence of target/unwanted
one-tangles scales linearly with the number of nu-
clear spins, since each G1quantity describes the
evolution of a single nuclear spin. Thus, the M-

out computational difficulty. Similarly, œµp,M(E)
scales linearly with the size of the total size of the
register (including target and unwanted nuclei),
and can also be calculated without difficulty. The
infidelity of the target gate due to the presence of
unwanted spins requires a summation over 2L‚àíK
Kraus operators. Therefore, the starting point to
identify optimal cases for preparing GHZ M-like
states is to calculate the target/unwanted one-
tangles in order to maximize (minimize) target
(unwanted) correlations. To further inspect the
optimal cases in terms of gate error, one can then
proceed with this metric to obtain full informa-
tion about the dynamics of the system.
7 Additional error analysis
In this section, we study the effect of pulse con-
trol errors and dephasing errors that can occur on
the electronic qubit. To find the impact of those
errors, we consider only their contribution to the
M-tangling power of the target subspace.
7.1 Target subspace M-way entanglement un-
der electronic dephasing
We begin by considering dephasing errors for the
electronic qubit. The dephasing error can be rep-
resented via the Kraus operators [66]:

In Appendix B, we prove that the ‚Äúdephased‚Äù
M-tangling power of the target subspace (con-
sisting of the electron and target nuclei) has a
simple closed-form expression. In particular, for
a CPMG decoupling sequence of unit time, t, and
ofNiterations, it takes the form:

We verify that in the limit of Œª0= 1andŒª1= 0,
we recover the ideal œµp,M(U)for the target sub-
space. Wefurtherfindthatthe M-tanglingpower
in the presence of electronic dephasing errors is
bounded from below by 50%.
We begin by studying the impact of the elec-
tronic dephasing for the 39 cases of preparing
GHZ 3-like states via the sequential scheme. The
results are shown in Fig. 9(a), where we consider
Œª0= 0.98,Œª1= 1‚àíŒª0, and dephasing angles
ranging from Œ∏‚àí1= 400¬µs toŒ∏‚àí1= 50¬µs. We
see that for Œ∏‚àí1= 400¬µs, we preserve high M-
tangling power over 90 %for most realizations.
For a dephasing angle Œ∏‚àí1= 100¬µs, we find
several cases with M-tangling power around 80-
85%. For a dephasing angle Œ∏‚àí1= 50¬µs, the
M-way correlations can drop to less than 60%
across many cases.
In Fig. 9(b), we repeat the calculations for the
27 cases of preparing GHZ 3-like states using the
multi-spinprotocol. The M-tanglingpowerofthe
multi-spin protocol remains higher in the pres-
ence of electronic dephasing compared to the se-
quential scheme. We even observe that for the
smallest dephasing angle of Œ∏‚àí1= 50¬µs, we have
several cases which exceed 80 %M-way correla-
tions. This behavior is expected since the multi-
spin scheme is, in principle, faster than the se-
quential protocol, and hence it is less sensitive to
electronic dephasing errors.
Figure9(c)showsthe M-tanglingpowerofcase
‚Äú1‚Äù of the sequential scheme, as a function of Œª0
andŒ∏‚àí1, whereas Fig. 9(d) shows the M-tangling
power of case ‚Äú1‚Äù of the multi-spin scheme. In the
sequential scheme, we control the nuclei C1 and
C18 (with a gate time ‚àº1843.2¬µs), whereas, in
the multi-spin protocol, we control the nuclei C1
and C2 (with a gate time ‚àº1366.5¬µs). Although
theresultsofFig.9(c)andFig.9(d)shouldnotbe
compared directly due to the different total tim-
ings, we note that the multi-spin scheme is more
robust to dephasing errors. In Appendix C, we
provide another example where we compare the

quential, but now for case ‚Äú16‚Äù. Although case ‚Äú7‚Äù
ofthemulti-spinschemehasatotalsequencetime
longer than the sequence time of the sequential
scheme, we find again that the multi-spin scheme
is more robust to dephasing. We attribute this
feature to the more complicated dephasing chan-
nel of the sequential scheme. The expression of
œµp,M(Edeph)for the sequential scheme is described
by different unit times tjand iterations Njsince
we are composing CPMG sequences to control
each nucleus. We believe that this feature can
potentially lead to M-way correlations that are
more sensitive to electronic dephasing errors.
7.2 Target subspace M-way entanglement un-
der pulse errors
We now consider the effect of pulse errors dur-
ing the control of the electronic spin. We as-
sume that the pulse error results in an over- or
under-rotation along the ÀÜx-axis of the electron.
We model such errors by modifying the perfect
Rx(œÄ)acting on the electron into Rx(œÄ+œµ) =
e‚àíiœÄ/2(1+œµ)œÉx.Such rotation angle errors yield
an evolution operator which is no longer block-
diagonal. Consequently, we cannot use the M-
tangling power we found in Eq. (6). Addition-
ally, we cannot study the M-tangling power for
an odd-sized system since, as we mentioned in
Sec. 3, the expression of Eq. (5) is only applicable
to CR-type evolution operators. This difficulty
in describing the M-way correlations on the evo-
lution operator level for odd Marises from the
fact that averaging over all initial states is not
straightforward due to the expression of the odd
M-tangle we start with. Nevertheless, by model-
ing the rotation angle error in this way, we still
preserve unitary dynamics, and we can find the
impact of such errors on the M-tangling power of
even-sized systems numerically by making use of
Eq. (5).
First, we consider systematic errors and study
their impact on the cases of preparing GHZ 4-
like states via the sequential or multi-spin pro-
tocols. In Fig. 10(a) and Fig. 10(b), we show
theM-tangling power for the 29 cases of prepar-
ing GHZ 4-states, assuming a systematic over-
rotation of œµ= 2%andœµ= 8%respectively. The
dark blue bars depict the error-free case. The
light blue bars correspond to the XY2 sequence,
whereas the orange bars to the CPMG sequence,including the over-rotation errors. In the case of
2%error, we see that CPMG can provide high
values ofM-way correlations only for a few cases
(e.g., case ‚Äú5‚Äù, case ‚Äú11‚Äù, case ‚Äú17‚Äù, case ‚Äú24‚Äù).
However, if we consider the XY2 sequence whose
one unit ist/4‚àí(œÄ)X‚àít/2‚àí(œÄ)Y‚àít/4, we find
that the impact of the error on the quality of the
GHZ states is negligible. For an over-rotation er-
ror of 8%, theM-way correlations accumulated
via the CPMG sequence are lower than 50%,
whereas the XY2 sequence still provides high en-
tanglement across almost all cases (all cases be-
sides case ‚Äú9‚Äù and case ‚Äú20‚Äù).
We observe a similar behavior of systematic
over-rotation errors for the multi-spin scheme.
We depict the results for the multi-spin proto-
col in Fig. 10(c) and Fig. 10(d), where we assume
a systematic over-rotation error of 2%and8%,
respectively. For 2%error, we find that œµp,M(U)
obtainedviatheXY2schemeisextremelyrobust,
although the pulse iterations per case are in gen-
eral high:N= 128for case ‚Äú1‚Äù, N= 76for case
‚Äú2‚Äù,N= 124for case ‚Äú3‚Äù, N= 136for case ‚Äú4‚Äù,
N= 78for case ‚Äú5‚Äù, N= 223for case ‚Äú6‚Äù, and
N= 243for case ‚Äú7‚Äù. For an 8%error shown
in Fig. 10(d), case ‚Äú6‚Äù and case ‚Äú7‚Äù display the
most prominent reduction in M-way correlations
across all cases, which is consistent with the large
number of decoupling unit iterations.
The robustness of XY-sequences to pulse errors
has already been reported extensively in the lit-
erature [42, 67, 68, 69]. In Ref. [69], a quantum
process tomography protocol called boostrap was
used to determine control pulse errors for the œÄ
andœÄ/2pulses. Itwasmentionedthereinthatthe
œÄ/2pulses show twice as much variation than œÄ-
pulseerrorsindicatingthatthepulseedgeshavea
larger impact on shorter pulses. The pulse errors
were taken as constant during each run and the
same for different runs. The reported error val-
ues forœÄ-pulses were œµx=œµy=‚àí0.02(rotation
errors forœÄXandœÄYpulses),qx= 0.005(ÀÜx-axis
component of œÄYrotation),qy= 0(ÀÜy-axis com-
ponent ofœÄXrotation) and qz=¬±0.05(ÀÜz-axis
component of œÄXandœÄYrotations). More im-
portantly Ramsey, spin-echo, XY4, CPMG, and
UDD simulations with those parameters were in
strong agreement with experimental data. The
estimated pulse error was 1%. In Ref. [68] XY-
sequences were used to cancel out the systematic
pulseerrors, suppressdecoherenceoftheelectron,

range ofœµp,M(U)where we run 500 trials per case, with different random samplings per sequence iteration. In (b),
we perform 1000 random trials per case to display the error bars.

noise, which was introduced in the same stripline
that was used for the control pulses. The fidelity
of a singleœÄ-pulse on the electron was again es-
timated to be 99 %using calibration techniques
from Ref. [41, 67]. Therefore, since the œÄ-pulse
microwave control can typically exceed 99 %for
defect platforms, we expect that the M-tangling
power we evaluate for the 2%systematic rotation
error will be close to the experimentally observed
one. In Appendix E, we perform another simu-
lation with the aforementioned error parameters
and verify that the M-tangling power we obtain
for the ideal CPMG sequence is close to the one
obtained via the XY2 sequence in the presence of
pulse imperfections. This reveals that combining
our protocols with the XY2 decoupling sequence
is sufficient to prepare high-fidelity GHZ Mstates
in the presence of realistic experimental errors.
We continue the pulse error analysis, assuming
random over-/under-rotation pulse errors, which
we sample from a normal distribution with stan-
dard deviation œÉ= 0.01. In Fig. 11(a), we show
the meanM-tangling power for the XY2 (light
bluebars)andfortheCPMG(orangebars), using
the 29 cases of preparing GHZ 4-like states with
the sequential scheme. In each case, we run 500
independent trials where we sample anew from
the normal distribution (per iteration of the de-
couplingunit), andweevaluatethemean œµp,M(U)
across the 500 trials. For comparison, we also
display the ideal œµp,M(U)per case. CPMG and
XY2 perform on par when random pulse errors
are present. The error bars mark the range of
œµp,M(U)for the 500 trials per case. We observe
that for the sequential scheme, the M-tangling
power in the presence of random pulse errors is
higher than 0.7 across all cases.
In Fig. 11(b), we show the mean M-tangling
power for the 7 cases of preparing GHZ 4-like
statesusingthemulti-spinscheme. Wesampleer-
rors from the normal distribution with standard
deviationœÉ= 0.01and repeat the calculation
500 times per case to collect statistics and eval-
uate the mean M-tangling power. Once again,
we observe that the XY2 and CPMG sequences
perform on par in the presence of random over-
/under-rotation errors. The error bars per case
correspond to the range of œµp,M(U)for a total of
500 random trials.
Overall, we find that the generation of high-quality GHZ Mstates is possible with the current
state-of-the-art experimental control and con-
straints. Our formalism provides a detailed anal-
ysis of the entanglement generation in the pres-
ence of errors and allows us to address the prob-
lem of designing optimal entangling gates that
saturate all-way correlations.
8 Conclusions
Genuine multipartite entangled states are an
essential component of quantum networks and
quantum computing. Exploiting the full poten-
tial of nuclear spins in defect platforms for large-
scale applications requires precise and fast entan-
glement generation. We showed under what con-
ditions decoupling sequences produce gates capa-
ble of maximizing all-way correlations and quan-
tified the entanglement capability of the gates
through the M-tangling power. Using this for-
malism, we guided the selection of sequence pa-
rameters and nuclear spin candidates to prepare
high-quality GHZ M-like states by appropriate
driving of the electron spin. We improved the se-
quential entanglement generation scheme, push-
ing the gate time to as low as 4 ms for preparing
GHZ-likestatesofupto10spins. Wealsostudied
the possibility of direct entanglement generation,
whichperformsonparwiththesequentialscheme

tage that the latter approach drastically reduces
the gate count and speeds up the entanglement
generation. Further, westudiedtheentanglement
of mixed states, revealing that the M-way corre-
lations of a target subspace are sensitive to resid-
ual entanglement with the unwanted nuclei. We
introduced a non-unitary M-way entanglement
metric, which additionally captures correlations
between the target subspace and the unwanted
nuclei and showed that it is upper-bounded by
theunitary M-tanglingpower. Wederivedanon-
unitaryM-tangling power for the target subspace

vealing that the multi-spin protocol can have in
principle superior performance compared to con-
ventional schemes due to its shorter implemen-
tation time. Finally, we studied the impact of
pulse errors on the target subspace M-tangling
power and showed that our protocols combined
with XY decoupling sequences can provide high-
fidelity preparation of GHZ states in the presence

the way for the systematic and efficient creation
of multi-partite entanglement in spin defect sys-
tems for quantum information applications.

œÑ3(|œà‚ü©) : =|‚ü®œà|œÉx‚äóœÉy‚äóœÉy|œà‚àó‚ü©|2
=Tr[œÅ(œÉx‚äóœÉy‚äóœÉy)œÅ‚àó(œÉx‚äóœÉy‚äóœÉy)].
(22)
We can linearize the above formula by noticing
that we can write the three-tangle by extending
the Hilbert space into a 6 qubit system:
œÑ3(|œà‚ü©) = 23Tr[œÅ‚äó2P(+)
143/productdisplay
i=2P(‚àí)
i,i+3]. (23)
The above expression can be understood as a
‚Äúvectorized‚Äù form of Eq. (22), since we note that
|œÉy‚ü©=vec(œÉy) =‚àíi(|01‚ü©‚àí|10‚ü©), which means
P(‚àí)= 1/2(1‚àíSWAP )between the sectors iand
i+Mcanberepresentedas P(‚àí)=1

œÑM(|œà‚ü©) = 2MTr[œÅ‚äó2P(+)

i=2P(‚àí)
i,i+M].(24)
The most general expression for the odd M-
tangle for states that undergo arbitrary unitary
evolution can be found in Ref. [57]. We also veri-
fied by numerical inspection that Eq. (24) agrees
with the definition of the odd tangle of Ref. [57]
when the evolution is CR-type.
A.2 Entangling power of multipartite gates us-
ingM-way entanglement metrics
We define the M-tangling power as the average
of theM-tangleœµp,M=‚ü®œÑM(UœÅ0U‚Ä†)‚ü©, where the
averageistakenoverallinitialproductstates |œà0‚ü©ofMqubits, with œÅ0=|œà0‚ü©‚ü®œà0|. To combine
both the even Mand oddMcases, we define ÀúP
as:
ÀúP=Ô£±
Ô£≤
Ô£≥/producttextM
i=1P(‚àí)
i,i+MevenM
P(+)
1,1+M/producttextM
i=2P(‚àí)
i,i+ModdM.(25)
In order to perform the average we consider the
uniform distribution of product states |œà0‚ü©ofM
qubits. For example, for a single-qubit state
cos(Œ∏/2)|0‚ü©+eiœïsin(Œ∏/2)|1‚ü©, the uniform distri-
bution isP(Œ∏,œï) = 1/(4œÄ) = (/integraltextsinŒ∏dŒ∏dœï )‚àí1.
Averaging over the uniform distribution in
HM2, we find that the M-tangling power reads:
œµp,M(U) = 2M‚ü®Tr[U‚äó2œÅ‚äó2
0(U‚Ä†)‚äó2ÀúP]‚ü©|œà0‚ü©‚äó2
= 2MTr[U‚äó2‚ü®œÅ‚äó2

= 2MTr[U‚äó2‚Ñ¶p0(U‚Ä†)‚äó2ÀúP],
(26)
where ‚Ñ¶p0= (d+ 1)‚àíM/producttextM
i=1P(+)
i,i+M, withd= 2
andP(+)
i,i+M= 1/2(12M√ó2M+SWAPi,i+M). To
prove the expression for ‚Ñ¶p0, it suffices to note
that the uniform distribution of product states
factorizes, and hence we can consider the total
average as averages of the sectors iandi+M,
‚àÄi. Thus, we have ‚Ñ¶p0=/producttextM
iœâi,i+M. Since ‚Ñ¶p0
is symmetric under the exchange of iandi+M,
we then have œâi,i+M=cP(+)
i,i+M, wherecis a con-
stant equal to c= (d+ 1)‚àí1(see also Ref. [72]).
Alternatively, the combined integral of the sec-
torsiandi+Mcan be expressed in terms of an
integral over the unitary group where the initial
state is fixed and we vary the unitary acting on i
andi+Msystems:

A.3 Proof of M-tangling power for CR-
evolution
Before going into the proof, it will be use-
ful to find the action of products of sym-
metric/antisymmetric projectors (which
project onto the sectors iandi+M) on
a trial product state. Suppose we have a
collection of states {|œïl‚ü©,|œïl+M‚ü©}M
l=1. Sup-
pose further that we have the ordered ket
|œï1‚ü©1...|œïM‚ü©M|œï1+M‚ü©1+M...|œï2M‚ü©2M :=/producttextM
l=1|œïl‚ü©l|œïl+M‚ü©l+M. If we act with the projec-
tors ÀúP(¬±)=/producttextM
i=1P(¬±)
i,i+M, on the above state we
find:
2MÀúP(¬±)M/productdisplay
l=1|œïl‚ü©l|œïl+M‚ü©l+M=
M/productdisplay
l=1/bracketleftbig|œïl‚ü©l|œïl+M‚ü©l+M¬±|œïl+M‚ü©l|œïl‚ü©l+M/bracketrightbig.(28)Note that for the above equality to hold it is im-
portant that both the kets and the symbols inside
the kets are labeled by an index; otherwise if the
kets are not labeled the above expression holds
only up to re-ordering of the unlabeled kets.
To derive a closed-form expression for the M-
tangling power of CR-type gates in defect sys-
tems, we start by considering odd M. For odd
M, we start from the general expression:
œµp,M(U) = 2MTr[U‚äó2‚Ñ¶p0(U‚Ä†)‚äó2ÀúP], (29)
and we define the vector |m;m+M‚ü©=
|m1‚ü©1...|mM‚ü©M|m1+M‚ü©1+M...|m2M‚ü©2M. The
action of the projectors P(+)
1,1+M/producttextM
l=2P(‚àí)
l,l+Mon
the above vector yields:
ÀúP|m;m+M‚ü©=1
2M(|m1‚ü©1|m1+M‚ü©1+M+|m1+M‚ü©1|m1‚ü©1+M)M/productdisplay

A.4M-tangling power of non-unitary quan-
tum evolution
In this section we consider a setup where we have
Lnuclear spins with Kof them being the target
ones, andL‚àíKbeing the unwanted spins. Thus,
the target subspace has M=K+ 1qubits, con-
sisting of the electron and Ktarget nuclear spins.
In Ref. [38] we showed that the Kraus operators
associated with the partial trace operation of the
L‚àíKunwanted spins have the closed form ex-
pression:

nj|0‚ü©, (46)
where for the i-th Kraus operator, the first prod-
uct is taken over the unwanted spins comprising
the environment that are in |0‚ü©, and the sec-
ond product is taken over the unwanted spins
that are in|1‚ü©. If all spins are in |0‚ü©, then
the second product is 1, whereas if all spins arein|1‚ü©the first product is 1. Further, we have

2‚àíinj,zsinœïj
2and‚ü®1|Rnj|0‚ü©=

2(nx,j+iny,j).
The evolution of the target subspace is thus de-
scribed by the Kraus operators via the quantum
channelE(œÅ) =/summationtext

k. To include the im-
pact of the unwanted subspace into the M-way
entanglement that is generated by the quantum
evolution, we define the M-tangling power of the
non-unitary quantum channel:

We note that the expressions for even/odd num-
ber of qubits in the target subspace are identical.Further, the non-unitary M-tangling power is up-
per bounded by the unitary M-tangling power.
Let us now simplify the expression that appears due to the summation over Kraus operators. We
first define the set S={1,2,...,L‚àíK}of unwanted spin indices. Let P(S)be the power set of S,
i.e.:
P(S) : =/braceleftÔ£¨ig
{},{1},{2},...,{L‚àíK},...
{1,2},{1,3},...,{1,L‚àíK},...
{1,2,...,L‚àíK}/bracerightÔ£¨ig
.(55)
This power set is useful in order to write down which unwanted spins are in |0‚ü©or|1‚ü©in the Kraus
operators. Let p‚ààP(S)be an element of the power set and l‚ààpbe an unwanted spin index within
the subsetp. We now start from:

BM-tangling power of target sub-
space under dephasing channel
In this section, we extend our formalism to in-
clude dephasing errors that can occur on the elec-
tron during the entanglement generation. The
dephasing on the electron can be expressed via
the following Kraus operators [66]:
K0(Àút) =/radicalbig
Œª0/parenleftÔ£¨igg
eiŒ∏Àút0

K1(Àút) =/radicalbig
Œª1/parenleftÔ£¨igg
e‚àíiŒ∏Àút0
0eiŒ∏Àút/parenrightÔ£¨igg
, (62)
whereŒª0+Œª1= 1. Assuming that dephas-
ing occurs during the free evolution periods, theelectron-nuclear spin register evolves under the
new Kraus operators:

We label the Kraus operators of one unit with the bitstring m= (m1,m2,m3), where each mjcan
take the value of 0 or 1. The only non-zero terms occur for (q,j,r ) = (0,0,1)and(q,j,r ) = (1,1,0),
respectively. Thus, the Kraus operator reads:

dephasing, i.e., Œª0= 1,Œª1= 0andŒ∏= 0, theonly Kraus operator that survives corresponds to
the bitstring of m= [0,..., 0]T, and we recover
the unitary channel. We can verify this from the

C Comparison of sequential with
multi-spin schemes in the presence of
electronic dephasing
In this section, we compare the performance
of the multi-spin with the sequential scheme in
the presence of electronic dephasing errors. In
Fig. 12(a) we show œµp,M(Edeph)of case ‚Äú16‚Äù of
preparing GHZ 3-like states for the sequential
scheme. In Fig. 12(b) we show again œµp,M(Edeph)
of case ‚Äú7‚Äù of preparing GHZ 3-like states for the
multi-spin scheme. The nuclei we control with
the sequential scheme are C5 and C13, and with
the multi-spin scheme, C4 and C5. The to-
tal sequence time for the sequential scheme is1357.9¬µs, and for the multi-spin is 1916.6¬µs.
Although the multi-spin scheme requires slightly
longer time than the sequential one, it is again
more robust to dephasing errors. This feature
could be attributed to the different unit times tj
and sequence iterations Njthat enter the expres-
sionofœµp,M(Edeph)forthesequentialschemesince
we are composing CPMG sequences of different
timings and iterations in the sequential protocol.
D Comparison of XY2 and CPMG per-
formance to pulse errors
In this section, we study over-/under-rotation er-
rors for the electronic control pulses. We consider
the optimal cases we found in the main text for
preparing GHZ 4-like states via the sequential or
multi-spin scheme. The systematic pulse errors
are simulated as Rx/y(œÄ+œµ) =e‚àíiœÄ/2(1+œµ)œÉx/y
for the CPMG and XY2 sequences. We calcu-
late the deviation between the M-tangling power
of the target subspace in the absence of errors,

ent colored lines correspond to each one of the
7 cases, and the labels correspond to the num-
ber of total sequence iterations. We see that
for small pulse errors ( ‚â§3‚àí4%), the devia-
tion in estimating this quantity is on the order
10‚àí3‚àí10‚àí2. Additionally, we expect that as the
number of pulses increases, the deviation is, in
principle, enhanced [e.g., see dark red line versus
green line]. This feature, however, does not al-
ways hold since the dynamics are case-dependent
and tend to corrupt the GHZ preparation differ-
ently. In Fig. 13(b), we repeat the same calcu-
lation assuming the CPMG sequence for a range
of systematic pulse errors from 0.1‚àí0.8%. As
expected, the ability of the CPMG sequence to
prepare high-quality GHZ 4-like states is severely
impacted by the pulse errors.

E Rotation angle and rotation axis er-
rors
In this section we consider the effect of rotation
angle and rotation axis errors on the M-tangling
power. We consider as an example the 7 cases
of preparing GHZ 4-like states via the multi-spin
scheme. To showcase the robustness of the XY2
decoupling sequence, we consider both rotation
axis and rotation angle errors, assuming the esti-
mated parameters from Ref. [69], which we also
mentioned in Sec. 7.2. In particular, we model
the erroneous œÄXandœÄYpulses as:
Rx(œÄ+œµx) =e‚àíi(œÄ+œµx)/2(‚àö
1‚àíq2zœÉx+qzœÉz),(74)
Ry(œÄ+œµy) =e‚àíi(œÄ+œµy)/2(qxœÉx+‚àö
1‚àíq2x‚àíq2zœÉy+qzœÉz).
(75)In Fig. 14 we show the ideal M-tangling power
(dark blue bar) assuming a perfect CPMG decou-
pling sequence. The light blue bars correspond to
the XY2 decoupling sequence which includes the
errorsœµx=œµy=‚àí0.02,qz= 0.05,qx= 0.005.
We observe that the deviation in the expected
M-way correlations in the presence of both rota-
tion axis and rotation angle errors is sufficiently
small, and hence the XY2 decoupling sequence
can be reliably used in experiments to prepare
high-fidelity GHZ states.

the presence of pulse and rotation axis errors. The dark
blue bars show the œµp,M(U)we find via the ideal CPMG
sequence for the 7 cases of preparing GHZ 4-like states
via the multi-spin scheme. The light blue bars show
theœµp,M(U)obtained via the XY2 decoupling sequence
assuming both rotation axis and rotation angle errors.

and additionally shift the HF parameters Aand
Bof the target nuclear spins by 0.01 or 0.05 kHz.

for the cases of preparing GHZ states up to 6
qubits for the sequential scheme in Fig. 15(a) and
for the multi-spin scheme in Fig. 15(b). We ob-
serve that the presence of a 0.01 kHz uncertainty
in the HF parameters only produces a negligi-
ble uncertainty on the order of 10‚àí3relative to
Accepted in Quantum2024-02-28, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 34our ideal calculations for œµp,M(U). In Fig. 16,
we repeat the same calculations for the sequen-
tial scheme in Fig. 16(a) and for the multi-spin
scheme in Fig. 16(b), assuming a shift of the HF
parameters by 0.05 kHz. We note that the error
in the estimation of œµp,M(U)is on the order of
10‚àí2‚àí10‚àí3. Thus, based on the experimentally
achievable accuracy in the measured HF param-
eters [37], we can estimate the M-tangling power
to a relatively narrow confidence interval. Opti-
mization within a small range of the optimal pa-
rameterst‚àóandN‚àóthatwefindfordefinitevalues
of HF parameters can guide the experimental cal-
ibration of the timing of the pulses and optimal
sequence iterations.
G Optimization process for GHZ M-like
generation
Here we highlight the optimization procedure for
generating GHZ M-like states using the sequen-
tial or multi-spin protocols. In Fig. 2 of the main
text, we show a diagram of the optimization pro-
cedure for the sequential protocol. First, we need
to provide as inputs:
‚Ä¢the size of the GHZ-like state we want to
prepare (|GHZ|),
‚Ä¢the maximum resonance number ( kmax) to
search for each nuclear spin,
‚Ä¢the maximum time for the total sequence
and of individual gates ( Tmax),
‚Ä¢the tolerances of unwanted/target nuclear
one-tangles,
‚Ä¢the gate error tolerance.
Then, for each nuclear spin, we search over all
resonances by varying the unit time around each
resonance by Œ¥t=¬±0.2¬µs, and with a time step
of5√ó10‚àí3¬µs and select as optimal the unit time
twhere n0¬∑n1is as close as possible to the value
‚àí1. Having fixed the unit time, we then use the
analyticalexpressionsfortheminimaof G1which
give us the number of iterations that maximize
the nuclear one-tangle [see Ref. [38] for the ex-
pressions of the minima]. Since G1is periodic,
there are multiple numbers of iterations that can
minimizeG1, and so we usually truncate to about15maximaoftheone-tangles, whichwealsopost-
select such that N¬∑t‚â§Tmax. Note that here
Tmaxcould be the gate time restriction we impose
for the gate time of a single decoupling sequence,
rather than the total gate time restriction for the
composition of all sequential gates. We then in-
spect all elements in the sets of {t,N}and keep
those that give a sequence with gate time smaller
thanTmax. After this step, we calculate the re-
maining nuclear one-tangles and check if they are
smaller than the unwanted one-tangle tolerance.
If this is not satisfied, we reject that particular
(t,N)case, whereas if this is satisfied, we store
the unit time and number of iterations. We re-
peat this process for each nuclear spin, such that
we have all the possible unit times and iterations
that can give maximal entanglement of the tar-
get spins with the electron while keeping the un-
wanted one-tangles minimal. At this stage, we
have multiple unit times and iterations that sat-
isfy these requirements.
We then combine the unit times and iterations
corresponding to sets associated with the selec-
tion of any|GHZ|‚àí1nuclei out of the entire nu-
clear register, such that the total decoupling se-
quencedoesnotexceedthemaximumtime, Tmax.
Foreachsuchnuclearspincombination, weevolve
all nuclei individually under the composite evolu-
tion and obtain their nuclear one-tangles. At this
step, each nuclear spin combination is associated
with multiple unit times and iterations that we
could consider, so we need to choose which tand
Nwe keep for each distinct nuclear spin combina-
tion. We choose those tandNwhich give rise to
a maximalM-tangle at the end of the composite
|GHZ|-1 entangling gates. Different choices could
be made here, e.g., selecting the tandNthat
givetheshortestgatetimeorpenalizingbothgate
time and the deviation from the maximal possi-
bleM-tangle using an appropriate cost function.
At this stage, we have narrowed down nuclear
spin candidates and associated each nuclear spin
combinationwithaparticularsequencecomposed
of timestjand iterations Njthat gives rise to
maximalM-way entanglement. For each of these
cases, we inspect whether the unwanted nuclear
one-tangles of the composite evolution are below
theunwantedone-tangletoleranceweimposed. If
this is satisfied, we accept this case and proceed
with the calculation of the gate error. Finally,
we accept this case if the gate error is lower than

the gate error tolerance. In Table 2, we provide
the tolerances and relevant parameters we set for
each GHZ size.
Regarding the multi-spin protocol, we are not
composing gates since we are interested in a
single-shot operation that generates direct en-
tanglement of the electron with multiple nuclei.
We explain here the procedure we follow accord-
ing to the flowchart of Fig. 2. We start with
one nuclear spin selected from the entire register
and find its resonance time for some particular
resonance number k. We vary the unit time t
within¬±0.25¬µs and define an upper bound for
the maximum number of iterations that respects
the gate time restriction for the particular unit
time. Then, for all unit times and N‚àà[1,Nmax]
we obtain all the nuclear one-tangles using the
knowledge of rotation angles and the dot product
ofthenuclearaxesforeachnucleusgivenoneiter-
ation. Then, for all possible times and iterations,
wecheckhowmanyone-tanglesareabovethetar-
get one-tangle tolerance and how many are below
the unwanted one-tangle tolerance. If we have
|GHZ|‚àí1one-tangles above the target one-tangle
tolerance, and all other nuclear one-tangles are
below the unwanted one-tangle tolerance, then
we accept this case. We repeat this process by
choosing a different resonance number k, up to
somekmax. Then, we select a different nuclear
spin from the register as our starting point and
repeat all the aforementioned steps.
Aftercompletingtheabovestage, wehavemul-
tiple times and iterations for which we maximize
|GHZ|‚àí1target one-tangles simultaneously. We
then rearrange all these cases corresponding to
different unit times and iterations in terms of
unique spin combinations. For each spin com-bination, we select the time and iterations of
the single-shot operation, which give the maxi-
malM-tangle. Similar to the sequential scheme,
the choice of narrowing down particular tand
Ncould be based on minimal gate time or a
cost function that both minimizes gate time and
maximizes the M-tangle for the particular spin
combination. Finally, for each spin combination
we evolve all unwanted nuclear spins individually,
such that we pass this information to the calcu-
lation of the gate error. If the gate error is below
the tolerance we imposed, we then accept this
case.
H One-tangles of Sequential Scheme
for generation of GHZ M-like states
Here we present the nuclear one-tangles corre-
sponding to the sequential entanglement scheme
of Fig. 5. The nuclear one-tangles for all different
realizations of entangling M‚àí1nuclei with the
electron to prepare GHZ M-like states are shown
in Fig. 17. The labels above each bar of each
case refer to some13C nuclear spin of the register
labeled as C j, withj‚àà[1,27].
I Eigendecomposition of mixed state
To keep the discussion general, we consider Lnu-
clear spins, with Kof them being the target ones
and hence, L‚àíKbeing the unwanted nuclei. To
derive the optimal ensemble for the calculation
of entanglement of the mixed state, we make the
assumption that the initial state of the system is
any arbitrary product pure state:
|œà0‚ü©=|œàel‚ü©‚äóL
l=1|œà(l)
nuc‚ü©, (76)

Fig. 5. Each case corresponds to a distinct DD sequence that selects different nuclei from the nuclear spin register.
Each bar shows the one-tangle of a particular nuclear spin, and the text above the bars corresponds to the nuclear
spin labels. From top to bottom, we show the nuclear one-tangles for the generation of GHZ 4-like up to GHZ 10-like
electron-nuclear entangled states.
where|œàel‚ü©=Œ±|0‚ü©+Œ≤|1‚ü©, withŒ±,Œ≤‚ààCand
|Œ±|2+|Œ≤|2= 1. Under a CR-type evolution the
electron-nuclear system evolves into:

j‚àà{0,1}œÉjj|œàel‚ü©‚äóL
l=1R(l)

(77)
Thus, the full density matrix reads:
œÅ=/summationdisplay
j,k‚àà{0,1}œÉjjœÅelœÉkk‚äólR(l)

nuc(R‚Ä†

Next, suppose that we wish to trace out the last
L‚àíKspins from the density operator (assuming
that we have ordered the basis such that these
appear last in the Kronecker product):
œÅred=/summationdisplay

interested in finding the eigenvectors and eigen-
values of the reduced density matrix. To do so,
we apply the inverse CR gates on the target
subspace of the electron and Ktarget nuclei to
find:
œÅ‚Ä≤

|Œ±|2Œ±Œ≤‚àóf01
Œ±‚àóŒ≤f10|Œ≤|2/parenrightÔ£¨igg
‚äólœÅ(l)
nuc.(80)
Thus, we can easily find the eigenvalues of the
electron‚Äôs reduced density matrix which read:
Œª¬±=1
2/parenleftÔ£¨ig
1¬±/radicalÔ£¨ig
(|Œ±|2‚àí|Œ≤|2)2+ 4|Œ±|2|Œ≤|2|f01|2/parenrightÔ£¨ig

(81)
whereas the eigenvectors are given by:

‚àí|Œ≤|2‚àíŒª¬±

, (82)
withc=Œ±‚àóŒ≤f10(providedcÃ∏= 0). Now, to find
the eigenvectors of the total reduced density ma-
trix, we need to reapply the controlled gates of

are the two eigenvectors:
[|v‚Ä≤

‚àí‚ü©]T=U[|v+‚ü©‚äól|œà(l)
nuc‚ü©,|v‚àí‚ü©‚äól|œà(l)
nuc‚ü©]T.
(83)
Thus, we now have the diagonalized density op-
erator:
œÅdiag=Œª+|v‚Ä≤
+‚ü©‚ü®v‚Ä≤
+|+Œª‚àí|v‚Ä≤
‚àí‚ü©‚ü®v‚Ä≤
‚àí|, (84)
which means that we can use the trial state:
|œàtrial‚ü©=/radicalÔ£¨ig
Œª+|v‚Ä≤
+‚ü©‚àíeiœá/radicalÔ£¨ig
1‚àíŒª+|v‚Ä≤
‚àí‚ü©,(85)
to find the entanglement of the mixed reduced
density matrix of the electron and the target nu-
clei. Note that given arbitrary initial states, the
highest rank that the reduced density matrix can
have (irrespective of the initial pure state of the
system, the number of total nuclei, or the number
of nuclei we trace out) is 2, due to the form of the
controlled evolution operator.
Inthecasewhentheelectronstartsfromanon-
superposition state e.g., when Œ≤= 0, we find that
the two eigenvalues are Œª+= 1andŒª‚àí= 0. The
corresponding eigenvectors are |v+‚ü©=|0‚ü©and
|v‚àí‚ü©=|1‚ü©, which after reapplying the controlled
gates read:
[|v‚Ä≤

‚àí‚ü©]T=U[|0‚ü©‚äól|œà(l)

(86)
Inthisscenario,since Œª‚àí= 0,thereduceddensity
matrix corresponds to a pure product state.
J Concurrence and three-tangle
Here we compare the entanglement of rank-2
mixed states involving two qubits with the en-
tanglement of rank-2 mixed states involving three
qubits. For two-qubit pure states the concur-
rence is defined as C(œÅ) =/radicalÔ£¨ig
2(1‚àíTr[œÅ2
A]) =/radicalÔ£¨ig
2(1‚àíTr[œÅ2
B]), whereœÅA(B)is the reduced den-
sity matrix of system A (B). The entanglement
of a mixed two-qubit state can be computed with
similar methods as in the main text by minimiz-
ing the concurrence of a trial state. We assume
that we have a trial state of the form:
|œàtrial,2‚ü©=‚àöp|Œ¶+‚ü©+/radicalbig
1‚àípeiœá|Œ¶‚àí‚ü©,(87)
where|Œ¶¬±‚ü©= 1/‚àö
2(|00‚ü©¬±|11‚ü©)are the two Bell
states. We further consider a rank-2 mixed three-
qubitstatewhichisthemixtureoftwo |GHZ¬±‚ü©=1/‚àö
2(|0‚ü©‚äó3¬±|1‚ü©‚äó3)states. Thus, similarly to the
main text, we define the trial state:
|œàtrial,3‚ü©=‚àöp|GHZ+‚ü©+/radicalbig
1‚àípeiœá|GHZ‚àí‚ü©.
(88)
For each value of p‚àà[0,1]we vary the rela-
tive phase of the two terms, œá, for both|œàtrial,2‚ü©
and|œàtrial,3‚ü©, and obtain the minimal concur-
rence, or three-tangle, respectively. We plot the
results as a function of pin Fig. 18. We ob-
serve that the minimum concurrence, as well as
the minimum three-tangle are both convex func-
tions. In fact, the minimum concurrence is given
byC= 2|p‚àí1/2|and the minimum three-tangle
by(1‚àí2p)2. We note that for all values of p(ex-
cept forp= 1/2where we have maximal mixed
states) the minimum three-tangle is lower than
the minimum concurrence, and hence the three-
way entanglement is more sensitive to the rela-
tive ratio of the superposition terms in the mixed
state than the concurrence of two-qubit mixed
states.
Figure 18: Minimum concurrence of a mixture of Bell
states (blue), and minimum three-tangle of a mixture
of|GHZ¬±‚ü©states (red). The black dashed line is the
analytical expression of the minimum three-tangle.
