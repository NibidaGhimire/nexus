Non-Hermitian band theory distinguishes between line gaps and point gaps. While point gaps
can give rise to intrinsic non-Hermitian band topology without Hermitian counterparts, line-gapped
systems can always be adiabatically deformed to a Hermitian limit. Here we show that line-gap
topology and point-gap topology can be intricately connected: topological line-gapped systems in
ddimensions induce nontrivial point-gap topology on their (d−1)-dimensional boundaries when
suitable internal and spatial symmetries are present. Since line-gapped systems essentially realize
Hermitian topological phases, this establishes a correspondence between Hermitian bulk topology
and intrinsic non-Hermitian boundary topology. For the correspondence to hold, no non-Hermitian
perturbations are required in the bulk itself, so that the bulk can be purely Hermitian. Concomi-
tantly, the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations in the bulk does not affect any results as long as
they do not close the bulk line gap. On the other hand, non-Hermitian perturbations are essential
on the boundary to open a point gap. The non-Hermitian boundary topology then further leads
to higher-order skin modes, as well as chiral and helical hinge modes, that are protected by point
gaps and hence unique to non-Hermitian systems. We identify all the internal symmetry classes
where bulk line-gap topology induces boundary point-gap topology as long as an additional spatial
symmetry is present, and establish the correspondence between their topological invariants. There
also exist some symmetry classes where the Hermitian edge states remain stable, in the sense that
even a point gap cannot open on the boundary.
I. INTRODUCTION
Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors
in the ten Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) symmetry classes [1]
are gapped in their d-dimensional bulk but exhibit gap-
less edge states on ( d−1)-dimensional boundaries [2–
4]. These edge states are protected by the bulk gap and
symmetries and cannot be removed by local symmetry-
preserving perturbations without a phase transition. In
non-Hermitian (NH) systems, two notions of gap, line
gaps and point gaps, are fundamental for topological
phases [5–7]. While line-gapped systems are always de-
formable to either a Hermitian (real line gap) or anti-
Hermitian (imaginary line gap) gapped limit, point-
gapped systems may not have any gapped Hermitian
or anti-Hermitian counterparts. Correspondingly, point-
gapped systems, as well as line-gapped systems that only
have an anti-Hermitian limit, may realize a radically dif-
ferent kind of topology that is intrinsic to NH systems. In
the following, we use the term NH topology for these new
topological equivalence classes that arise when a point
gap or imaginary line gap is kept open. At the same time,
we refer to real line gap topology as Hermitian topology ,
as it can be obtained by perturbing around gapped Her-
mitian systems. Similar to Hermitian topological phases,
nontrivial NH topology in ddimensions is reflected by a
gap closing on ( d−1)-dimensional boundaries. In many
cases, this gap closing induces a NH skin effect [8, 9],
where a macroscopic number of eigenstates are localized
at the system boundaries [10–16]. Some NH systems in
two dimensions (2D) and three dimensions (3D) may fur-
thermore avoid a skin effect on (almost all) boundariesand instead exhibit anomalous NH boundary dispersion
such as unpaired exceptional points [17–21].
Here, we uncover an intricate connection between Her-
mitian topology in ddimensions and NH topology on
their ( d−1)-dimensional boundaries that is guaranteed
by spatial symmetry. We consider Hermitian topological
insulators and superconductors in the presence of small
NH perturbations. The perturbations are chosen such
that they preserve a given NH symmetry which reduces
to the appropriate AZ symmetry in the Hermitian limit.
This requirement ensures that the edge states of the orig-
inal phase cannot acquire a real line gap. Conversely,
the perturbations generically open either a point gap or
an imaginary line gap on the boundary. In a geometry
with open boundary conditions (OBC) in one direction
and periodic boundary conditions (PBC) in the ( d−1)
remaining directions (the “slab geometry”), the NH per-
turbed system can therefore in principle realize the intrin-
sic NH topological phase of a ( d−1)-dimensional bulk NH
system. We solidify this possibility by proving that in the
presence of pseudo-inversion symmetry (a simple spatial
symmetry that is compatible with nontrivial NH topol-
ogy [22–24]), nontrivial NH topology is guaranteed on
the boundaries of certain Hermitian topological phases.
This statement holds irrespective of the choice of specific
model parameters or boundary terminations, and only
relies on the presence of a point gap in the slab geome-
try. Thus, while the mere opening of a point gap does
not necessarily lead to NH topology, we demonstrate that
the combination of a point gap and Hermitian topology
in the bulk must give rise to boundary NH topology, as
long as pseudo-inversion symmetry is preserved. We de-arXiv:2304.03742v2  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  2 Aug 20232

rive the resulting mapping between NH boundary topo-
logical invariants and Hermitian bulk invariants in all AZ
symmetry classes and their NH extensions (Tabs. I and
II). We also show that d-dimensional Hermitian topolog-
ical phases in the presence of small NH perturbations
host, via their boundary-induced ( d−1)-dimensional NH
topology, ( d−2)-dimensional higher-order NH gapless
states such as higher-order skin modes and chiral or hinge
modes protected by a point gap and pseudo-inversion
symmetry. This phenomenon constitutes a novel kind
of Hermitian-NH hybrid higher-order topology. Unlike
previous Hermitian and NH examples of higher-order cor-
ner and hinge states [25–33], the higher-order skin modes
arising from this mechanism do not appear on opposite
boundaries.
We note that Ref. 34 recently discussed NH topological
phases at the boundaries of 2D systems. However, the
nontrivial point-gap topology discussed in Ref. 34 does
not rely on the presence of a 2D bulk but can instead be
viewed as that of an independent one-dimensional (1D)
NH system. This is not the case for our work, where
each boundary carries an anomalous half[35] of a ( d−1)-
dimensional NH system that is stabilized by the presence
of ad-dimensional bulk with Hermitian topology. Fur-
thermore, Refs. 36–38 recently studied the corner skin
effect of NH Chern insulators. However, Refs. 36–38 did
not find a connection between the Hermitian topology in
the 2D bulk and the NH topology in the 1D boundaries.
Here, we clarify this connection and further generalize
it to arbitrary AZ symmetry classes and spatial dimen-
sions. Notably, the NH topology in 2D surfaces can leadTABLE II. Correspondence between 3D bulk line-gap topol-

metry, as summarized in Table I for 2D and Table II for
3D.
II. 2D CHERN INSULATOR (CLASS A)
We begin with the simplest case: Hermitian AZ class
A (no symmetry) in 2D. This class of systems is charac-
terized by an integer-valued topological invariant, given
by the Chern number C∈Z. As a consequence of this
Chern number in the bulk, chiral edge modes appear un-
der OBC. Below, for both continuum and lattice systems,
we show that these chiral edge modes exhibit point-gap
topology in the presence of certain NH perturbations,
leading to the second-order skin effect at corners (Fig. 1).
A. Continuum theory
The elementary topological phase in class A has |C|=
1. In a Hermitian Chern insulator under PBC in the
x-direction and OBC in the y-direction (the “slab geom-
etry”), each boundary hosts a single gapless chiral mode
with dispersion E(kx) =±vkx, where vis the Fermi ve-
locity and the sign choice + ( −) applies to the top (bot-
tom) edge. The low-energy continuum Hamiltonian for3
the full slab geometry is then given by
H0(kx) =vkxτz, (1)
where we use 2 ×2 Pauli matrices τi(i= 0, x, y, z ) such
thatτz= +1 ( −1) corresponds to the top (bottom) edge.
We assume that the two edges are sufficiently separated
so that terms multiplying τxandτyin the Hamiltonian
are forbidden by the requirement of locality. We also fix
the Fermi level to lie at EF= 0 for simplicity.
We next add local NH perturbations. In general, we
obtain the perturbed Hamiltonian
H(kx) = iaτ0+ (vkx+ ib)τz, (2)
with a, b∈R. Depending on the values of aandb, this
Hamiltonian may or may not have a nontrivial spectral
winding number [6, 7]
W(E) =Z∞
−∞dkx
2πid
dkxlog det [ H(kx)−E],(3)
where E=EFis chosen as the real Fermi energy of the
Chern insulator ( EF= 0 in our Dirac theory). Notably,
Eq. (2) coincides with the continuum limit of the Hatano-
Nelson model [39, 40], in which bdenotes the asymmetry
of the hopping amplitudes. While the Pauli matrices τi
in the Hatano-Nelson model describe the valley degrees
of freedom, τiin our model describe the different flavors
of chiral edge modes at the different boundaries. We
also note that this definition involves integration bounds
atkx→ ±∞ that are appropriate for the low-energy
continuum theory in Eq. (2). For a microscopic lattice
model, we should instead integrate over the 1D Brillouin
zone kx∈[0,2π) and include the contributions from the
bulk modes. In such a case, the chiral edge modes con-
nect with the bulk modes, making the complex-spectral
winding number W(E) well defined and consistent with
the continuum description.
While the complex-spectral winding number W(E) can
be nonzero in general, we now show that additional spa-
tial symmetry can guarantee W(E)̸= 0. In particular,
we require pseudo-inversion symmetry
IH(k)I†=H(−k)†, (4)
which exchanges the top and bottom edges. In the par-
ticular Dirac model in Eq. (2), we have I=τx. Inver-
sion symmetry is fundamental for topological phases by
yielding symmetry indicators [41] and protecting topolog-
ical crystalline phases [42]. Pseudo-inversion symmetry
is a generalization of inversion symmetry in NH systems
and similarly relevant to NH topological phases [22–24].
Pseudo-inversion symmetry is respected by the NH chiral
edge modes as long as it is respected by the NH Chern
insulator in the 2D bulk, and is compatible with other
internal and spatial symmetries, as well as the nontriv-
ial Chern number. In the presence of pseudo-inversion
symmetry, we must have a= 0 while bcan be arbi-
trary. In this case, the winding number W(0) is always
abcdC2D=1W1D=1W1D=1+=W1D=−1
OBCFIG. 1. Skin effect at the boundaries of a non-Hermitian
Chern insulator. (a) A Chern insulator with periodic bound-
ary conditions is characterized by a 2D Hermitian topological
invariant, the Chern number C. We here consider the case
forC= 1. (b) With open boundary conditions in the verti-
cal direction (slab geometry), the Chern insulator hosts two
counter-propagating edge modes, one for each edge. In the
presence of small non-Hermitian perturbations and pseudo-
inversion symmetry, these edge modes acquire opposite life-
times (i.e., their energies develop opposite imaginary parts),
here indicated in blue and yellow. Viewing the Chern insu-
lator slab as an effective 1D system extending along the hor-
izontal, this induces a nontrivial 1D non-Hermitian topolog-
ical invariant, the complex-spectral winding number W= 1.
(c) In open boundary conditions along both directions, W= 1
induces a skin effect that manifests at two corners of the
system, here indicated in red. (d) Gluing a Hatano-Nelson
chain (shown in black with unidirectional hopping indicated
by the arrows) to each of the the two edges reduces the non-
Hermitian winding number Wby 2. Hence, W=Cholds
only modulo 2. This illustrates the importance of pseudo-
inversion symmetry (with the inversion center indicated by
the gray cross in the center panel): without pseudo-inversion
symmetry, it would be possible to couple a single Hatano-
Nelson chain to the boundary and thereby trivialize the non-
Hermitian winding number Wand skin effect.
nonzero and given by W(0) =−sign(vb), as long as there
is a point gap at E= 0 (that is, as long as b̸= 0).
While we cannot predict the sign of the winding number,
we have thereby shown |W(0)|= 1 as long as pseudo-
inversion-symmetric NH perturbations are present. We
also note that the complex-spectral winding number van-
ishes in the presence of conventional inversion symmetry
IH(k)I†=H(−k) [7, 23].
By the bulk-boundary correspondence of NH topologi-
cal systems, the complex-spectral winding number W(E)
in Eq. (3) leads to the skin effect under OBC [8, 9].
Consequently, W(E)̸= 0 for the NH chiral edge modes
results in second-order skin modes localized at the cor-
ners. Importantly, this corner skin effect is guaranteed
by the NH topology in the 2D bulk—the intricate com-
bination between the line-gap topology (i.e., Chern num-4
ber) and the NH perturbation that opens the point gap,
supplemented with pseudo-inversion symmetry (see also
Appendix A). Hence, it is stable against, for example,
symmetry-preserving continuous deformations at bound-
aries. It should also be noted that the corner skin effect
manifests itself in a semi-infinite system that is concerned
solely with one boundary. In other words, the corner skin
effect can be captured by pseudospectra instead of spec-
tra [43], as is also the case for the conventional (i.e., first-
order) skin effect [9]. In a finite system with open bound-
aries, by contrast, the two NH chiral edge modes can be
coupled with each other, and the skin modes may appear
in arbitrary boundary segments, as shown with a lattice
model shortly. Still, when the sample is cut into a rect-
angular geometry of linear extent L,O(L) chiral modes
generically accumulate at corners rather than edges in
the absence of fine tuning, analogous to 2D higher-order
topological insulators that feature gapless 1D edges only
for certain fine-tuned edge alignments [44].
Let us now turn to a system with C= 2. The unper-
turbed low-energy Hamiltonian is given by
H0(kx) =vkxτzσ0, (5)
where σi(i= 0, x, y, z ) is another set of Pauli matrices
that acts on the two chiral modes of each edge. Preserv-
ing pseudo-inversion symmetry I=τxσ0, NH perturba-
tions may for instance result in the NH Hamiltonian
H(kx) =vkxτzσ0+ iaτzσ0+ ibτzσz, (6)
with a, b∈R. For a > 0 and b= 0, we now ob-
tainW(0) = 2, while for a= 0 and b >0, we obtain
W(0) = 0, realizing a counter-example to the naive con-
jecture that the boundary NH winding number may be
fully determined by the bulk Chern number. This exam-
ple is sufficient to establish that pseudo-inversion symme-
try only fixes the slab geometry winding number mod-
ulo 2, consistent with the topological classification [7].
The same observation may also be understood as follows
[Fig. 1 (d)]. Without undergoing a bulk phase transition,
we can glue a Hatano-Nelson chain with W(0) = ±1
to the top boundary of the sample ( y > 0). Pseudo-
inversion symmetry then implies that we should also
glue another Hatano-Nelson chain with the same wind-
ing number to the bottom boundary ( y <0). This adia-
batic process changes the net winding number of the slab
geometry by ±2. Correspondingly, W(0) can be deter-
mined only modulo 2 from a bulk topological invariant
in the presence of pseudo-inversion symmetry.
As a consequence, the 1D NH winding number W(E)
of the slab geometry satisfies
W(EF) =C(mod 2) (7)
for a NH insulator in class A that is point-gapped at
the Fermi level EFand preserves pseudo-inversion sym-
metry (Tab. I). Correspondingly, each edge of a Chern
insulator realizes an anomalous halfof a Hatano-Nelson

chain. Around the Fermi level Re E=EF, the Hatano-
Nelson chain gives rise to two valley degrees of freedom
(i.e., right and left movers), whose imbalance in lifetime
is caused by non-Hermiticity. Notably, the NH chiral
edge modes in Eq. (2) have the same complex spectrum
and topological features as the Hatano-Nelson chain in
the long wavelength limit. Specifically, in the slab ge-
ometry, each of the NH chiral edge modes, as well as
each of the valley degrees of freedom in the Hatano-
Nelson chain, gives rise to the complex-spectral wind-
ing number |W(EF)|= 1/2, the sum of which yields
|W(EF)|= 1/2×2 = 1. An important difference is,
however, that the NH chiral edge modes appear only at
the boundaries, leading to a new type of NH boundary
phenomena—a higher-order skin effect.
B. Lattice model
We confirm the above continuum description by a NH
Chern insulator on a square lattice, described by [5, 13,
45–47]
H(k) = (m+tcoskx+tcosky)σx
+ (tsinkx+ iγ)σy+ (tsinky)σz (8)5
with t, m, γ ∈R. Under PBC, the complex spectrum is
obtained as [Fig. 2 (a)]
E(k) =±h
(m+tcoskx+tcosky)2
+ (iγ+tsinkx)2+ (tsinky)2i1/2
.(9)
This NH lattice model indeed respects pseudo-inversion
symmetry in Eq. (4) with I=σx. Furthermore, it is
also invariant under the combination of time reversal†
and reflection along the x-direction:
MyH(kx, ky)M†
y=H(kx,−ky)†, (10)
where My=σxKis an antiunitary operator with com-
plex conjugation K. Notably, this symmetry forbids the
skin effect along the y-direction in the bulk [7]. On the
other hand, no such constraints are present along the
x-direction. We will later discuss the effect of relaxing
this symmetry, which is not necessary for Eq. (7) but
convenient for our numerics since it allows us to clearly
separate bulk and boundary skin effects.
In the absence of the NH perturbation (i.e., γ= 0),
this model is characterized by the nontrivial Chern num-
berC= sgn ( m/t) for|m/t|<2 and no Chern number
C= 0 for |m/t|>2. Also in the presence of the NH
perturbation, the topologically nontrivial phase persists
as long as the real line gap is open. Consequently, a
pair of chiral edge modes appears under PBC along the
x-direction and OBC along the y-direction [Fig. 2 (b)],
whose energy dispersion is exactly obtained as [46]
E(kx) =±(tsinkx+ iγ). (11)
Here, the sign ±changes depending on the different
boundaries, and the momentum cutoff |coskx+m/t|<1
is imposed. These chiral edge modes on a lattice reduce
to Eq. (2) in the continuum limit kx→0, where tandγ
correspond to vandb, respectively. Consistent with the
continuum description, one of the chiral edge modes has
a positive imaginary part of eigenenergy and the other
has a negative imaginary part, leading to the opening of
a point gap around E= 0. The combined system of the
bulk and chiral edge modes contributes to the complex-
spectral winding number |W|= 1 in Eq. (3). We note
that no skin effect occurs for the bulk modes under PBC
along the x-direction and OBC along the y-direction due
to the extra symmetry Myin Eq. (10).
As a consequence of the complex-spectral winding, the
skin effect occurs in full OBC (i.e., OBC along both x
andy-directions). We obtain the complex spectrum for
full OBC [Fig. 2 (c)]. An extensive number of eigenstates
in the bulk are subject to the skin effect, but localized
only in the x-direction and delocalized in the y-direction.
This skin effect of bulk modes originates from the 1D
weak point-gap topology [9, 48]. In fact, the bulk com-
plex spectrum with fixed kyforms loops in the complex-
energy plane, leading to the nontrivial complex-spectral
winding as a function of kxfor each fixed ky. By con-
trast, the 1D weak point-gap topology is trivial alongthey-direction. This is due to the spatial symmetry
in Eq. (10), which forbids the skin effect along the y-
direction in the bulk. The different localization proper-
ties can be distinguished, for example, by the inverse par-
ticipation ratiosP
x,y|ϕn(x, y)|4/P
x,y|ϕn(x, y)|22
,
where the bulk skin modes (corner skin modes) have
O(1/Ly) [O(1)] inverse participation ratios. Some spe-
cial eigenmodes at the edges of the bulk spectrum are lo-
calized at the corners. Since they are intermediate eigen-
modes between the bulk modes and chiral edge modes,
they are not expected to exhibit general or universal be-
havior.
On the other hand, the NH chiral edge modes also
exhibit the skin effect. While their spectrum is com-
plex in the slab geometry, it becomes entirely real in full
OBC [compare Fig. 2 (c) with Fig. 2 (b)]. All of these
gapless modes that cross the real line gap are localized
along the x-direction as a consequence of the nontrivial
complex-spectral winding number in the slab geometry
[Fig. 2 (d)]. By contrast, they can be delocalized along
they-direction in our model. As also discussed above,
this is not a general feature but due to the symmetry in
Eq. (10) that is not necessary to establish the correspon-
dence in Eq. (7). The NH chiral edge modes exhibit the
corner skin effect if further generic perturbation terms
that break this symmetry are added to the Hamiltonian.
In fact, if a term +i γ2σzis added to Eq. (8), which re-
spects pseudo-inversion symmetry and is the only con-
stant NH perturbation other than the existing term mul-
tiplying γ, the reflection-type symmetry in Eq. (10) is
broken. In this case, a generic NH skin effect appears
when open boundaries are introduced in the y-direction.
Importantly, however, the point gap of the slab spec-
trum remains open and its nontrivial winding number
|W|= 1 remains quantized. Correspondingly, when OBC
are also introduced in the x-direction, a topologically-
protected higher-order NH skin effect occurs for which
almost all bulk modes are localized at a corner. Notably,
such an anomalous localization only at a single corner
is compatible with pseudo-inversion symmetry, because
this symmetry maps not between right eigenvectors of
the NH Hamiltonian but rather maps between right and
left eigenvectors.
The skin effects of bulk modes and chiral edge modes
arise from different topological origins and hence can be
compatible with each other in a single system. While
the former originates from the 1D weak point-gap topol-
ogy, the latter originates from our correspondence be-
tween the Hermitian bulk and NH boundary. Below,
we show that this correspondence is generally applica-
ble and yields several different types of NH boundary
phenomena. Owing to the different topological origins,
the two types of skin effect can be clearly separated. One
convenient way is to add the NH perturbations only at
boundaries, while we have hitherto focused on homoge-
neous NH perturbations throughout the system. In such
a case, a point gap can be open only at the boundaries,6
and hence only the corner skin effect arises. This pro-
cedure generally applies to the subsequent examples in
this work, for arbitrary symmetry classes and arbitrary
spatial dimensions.
III. 2D Z2-CLASSIFIED TOPOLOGICAL
INSULATOR (CLASS AII)
While time-reversal symmetry renders the Chern num-
ber trivial C= 0, it can instead give rise to a Z2-valued
topological invariant ν∈ {0,1}[2–4, 49–51]. This Z2
topological invariant, protected by time-reversal symme-
try, physically induces the quantum spin Hall effect ac-
companied by the emergence of helical edge modes. Here,
we study 2D time-reversal-invariant Hermitian systems
in class AII and the corresponding NH boundary phe-
nomena.
At low energy, the Hermitian slab Hamiltonian hosts
a pair of helical edge modes at each boundary described
by
H0(kx) =vkxτzσx. (12)
Here, the Pauli matrix σidescribes the spin degree of
freedom, and time-reversal symmetry is represented by
TH0(k)T†=H0(−k) (13)
withT= iτ0σyKand complex conjugation K. Similarly
to the previous case, τz= +1 ( τz=−1) describes a pair
of the helical edge modes at the top (bottom) boundary.
We again set the Fermi energy at EF= 0.
Time-reversal symmetry in Eq. (13) is generalized to
NH systems in two manners [7]. One is time-reversal
symmetry in Eq. (13), which corresponds to class AII in
NH systems. The other is time-reversal symmetry†,
TH(k)T†=H(−k)†, (14)
which corresponds to class AII†in NH systems. While
Eqs. (13) and (14) are equivalent to each other for Her-
mitian Hamiltonians, this is not the case for NH Hamil-
tonians. Notably, different topological invariants apply
to the two different symmetry classes. Consequently, the
helical edge modes induce different types of NH skin ef-
fect in classes AII and AII†, as shown below.
A. NH class AII
NH Hamiltonians in class AII are defined to respect
time-reversal symmetry in Eq. (13). The general NH
perturbation in this symmetry class is
H(kx) =vkxτzσx+ iX
i=x,y,z(aiτ0+biτz)σi, (15)
with ai, bi∈R. This Hamiltonian has a spectrum

number in Eq. (3) vanishes, W(0) = 0. We here note
that the complex-spectral winding number W(0) can be
trivial even in the presence of a point gap [8, 9], as is
also the case for our Dirac Hamiltonian with ax̸= 0 and
bx= 0. On the other hand, for ax= 0 and bx̸= 0,
we find W(0) = −2 sign( vbx). Correspondingly, impos-
ing pseudo-inversion symmetry with I=τxσ0leads to
ai= 0 for all i=x, y, z and protects the nontrivial spec-
tral winding. The result |W(0)|= 2 is compatible with
the 2Zclassification of 1D NH systems in class AII, where
the odd winding numbers are forbidden [7].
As a consequence, the 1D complex-spectral winding
number W(E) of the helical edge states in the slab ge-
ometry satisfies
W(EF) = 2 ν(mod 4) (17)
for a NH system in class AII that is point-gapped at the
Fermi level EFand preserves pseudo-inversion symmetry
(Tab. I).
B. NH class AII†
NH Hamiltonians in class AII†are defined to respect
time-reversal symmetry†in Eq. (14). The general NH
perturbations in class AII†now result in the low-energy
slab Hamiltonian
H(kx) =vkxτzσx+ iaτ0σ0+ ibτzσ0, (18)
with a, b∈R. Because of time-reversal symmetry†in
Eq. (14), the complex-spectral winding number in Eq. (3)
always vanishes, which is compatible with the Z2topo-
logical classification in terms of point gaps [7]. In fact,
we have W(EF) = 0 for Eq. (18), and instead have the
nontrivial Z2topological invariant
(−1)ν(E)= sgnPf [H(kx=π)T]
Pf [H(kx= 0)T]
×exp"
−1
2Zkx=π
kx=0dlog det [ H(kx)T]#)
.(19)
Depending on the values of aandb, the Z2topological
invariant may be trivial or nontrivial. This ambiguity is
again resolved by imposing pseudo-inversion symmetry
I=τxσ0, which sets a= 0. We then find ν(0) = 1 as
long as the point gap at E= 0 is open (that is, as long
asb̸= 0).
As a consequence, the 1D Z2topological invariant ν(E)
of the helical edge states in the slab geometry satisfies
ν(EF) =ν (20)
for a NH system in class AII†that is point-gapped at
the Fermi level EFand preserves pseudo-inversion sym-
metry (Tab. I). This relationship is guaranteed also by
K-theory [7].7

The system sizes are chosen as (a) 200 ×30 sites and (b, c,

Notably, as a consequence of the different topological
invariants, different types of corner skin effect appear. In
class AII, the NH helical edge states are characterized by
the complex-spectral winding number in Eq. (3), simi-
larly to the chiral edge states in a NH Chern insulator in
Sec. II. Hence, the skin modes are localized at the same
side of the sample in full OBC. In class AII†, on the other
hand, the NH helical edge states are no longer character-
ized by the winding number in Eq. (3) but exhibit the Z2
topological invariant in Eq. (19). An important feature
of the skin effect induced by this Z2topological invariant
is the presence of skin modes at both boundaries, de-
pending on the spin degree of freedom [9]. Consequently,
in contrast to class AII, the skin effect occurs at all the
corners in full OBC. Below, we confirm these different
types of corner skin effect in a NH lattice model.
C. Lattice model
As a lattice model for the above continuum description,
we study the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model [52]

with t, m∈R. The BHZ model respects time-reversal
symmetry in Eq. (13) with T= iτ0σyKand exhibits
theZ2-nontrivial ( Z2-trivial) topological invariant ν= 1
(ν= 0) for |m/t|<2 (|m/t|>2). Consequently,
under PBC along the x-direction and OBC along the
y-direction, a pair of helical edge states appears at
each boundary, which reduce to the energy dispersion
in Eq. (12) in the low-energy limit kx→0. The BHZ
model also respects inversion symmetry in Eq. (4) with
I=τxσ0.
Now, we add NH perturbations to the BHZ model that
preserve certain symmetries. First, we consider the NH
perturbations
∆HAII= iγy0τyσ0+ iγzyτzσy (22)
with γy0, γzy∈R. The combined NH system H0(k) +
∆HAIIrespects time-reversal symmetry in Eq. (13) with
T= iτ0σyKand hence belongs to class AII. It also re-
spects pseudo-inversion symmetry in Eq. (4) with I=
τxσ0, as well as the spatial symmetry in Eq. (10) with
My=τxK. Under OBC only along the y-direction, a
pair of helical edge modes appears, and a point gap is
open, further leading to the skin effect under full OBC
(Fig. 3). Similarly to the NH Chern insulator in 2D class
A, the NH helical edge modes are generically localized at8
an edge, instead of the corners. As also discussed above,
this is due to the additional spatial symmetry; under fur-
ther generic perturbations, the NH helical edge modes are
localized at the corner and exhibit the second-order skin
effect.
Next, we consider the NH perturbations that preserve
different symmetry,
∆HAII†= iγyxτyσx+ iγyzτyσz (23)
with γyx, γyz∈R. Instead of time-reversal symmetry
in Eq. (13), this NH generalization of the BHZ model,
H0(k) + ∆ HAII†, respects time-reversal symmetry†with
T= iτ0σyKand hence belongs to class AII†. It also
respects pseudo-inversion symmetry in Eq. (4) and the
spatial symmetry in Eq. (10). Similarly to the previous
cases, a point gap is open under OBC only along the y-
direction, and the skin effect occurs in full OBC (Fig. 4).
A unique feature of this symmetry class and the Z2topo-
logical invariant manifests itself in the locations at which
the skin modes are localized. In fact, depending on the
spin degree of freedom, the skin modes appear at both
edges. In the semi-infinite boundary conditions, a recip-
rocal pair of second-order skin modes appears at different
corners.
IV. 3D Z-CLASSIFIED TOPOLOGICAL
INSULATOR (CLASS AIII)
Similarly to the 2D case, boundary modes of a 3D
topological insulator or superconductor generally exhibit
point-gap topology in the presence of NH perturbations.
In general, 3D Hermitian systems can host Ztopological
phases in AZ symmetry classes AIII, DIII, and CI, and
Z2topological phases in symmetry classes AII and CII
(see Tab. II). As a prototypical example of the Ztopo-
logical phase, we here study the Dirac surface modes of
a 3D topological insulator protected by chiral symme-
try in class AIII (Fig. 5). In contrast to the 2D case,
the NH boundary modes do not exhibit the skin effect
but form chiral hinge modes. These chiral hinge modes
are stabilized by a point gap, rather than the line gap
of second-order Hermitian topological insulators, and are
hence unique to NH systems. In Sec. V, we separately ex-
plore non-Hermiticity in Z2-classified topological phases
in 3D for symmetry class AII.
A. Continuum theory
The topological invariant of 3D Hermitian systems in
class AIII is the 3D winding number W∈Z[2–4, 53].
Here, Hermitian Hamiltonians in class AIII are defined
to respect chiral symmetry
CH0(k)C†=−H0(k), (24)
with a unitary matrix C. For the simplest nontrivial case
W= 1, the low-energy continuum Hamiltonian in the

ical insulator with chiral symmetry (class AIII). (a) In pe-
riodic boundary conditions, a 3D topological insulator pro-
tected by chiral symmetry is characterized by the Hermitian
3D winding number W. We here consider the case for W= 1.
(b) With open boundary conditions along the z-direction, the
3D topological insulator hosts two Dirac surface modes, one
for each surface (indicated in purple). In the presence of non-
Hermitian perturbations, the two surface modes together pos-
sess a point gap and exhibit the nontrivial 2D non-Hermitian
topological invariant, C= 1 [7]. (c) In open boundary condi-
tions along both zandy-directions, C= 1 leads to the emer-
gence of chiral hinge modes, here indicated in blue and yellow.
(d) Gluing a 2D point-gapped non-Hermitian model (shown in
black) to each of the two surfaces reduces the non-Hermitian
topological invariant Cby 2. Hence, C=Wholds only mod-
ulo 2. This illustrates the importance of pseudo-inversion
symmetry (with the inversion center indicated by the gray
cross in the center panel): without pseudo-inversion symme-
try, it would be possible to couple a single 2D point-gapped
non-Hermitian model to one of the surfaces and thereby triv-
ialize Cand the chiral hinge modes.
slab geometry [Fig. 5 (b)] is given by the Dirac surface
modes
H0(k) =vkxτzσx+vkyτ0σy, (25)
where the Pauli matrices σidescribe the internal degree
of freedom at each surface, and τz= +1 ( −1) corresponds
to the top (bottom) surface. These surface modes indeed
respect chiral symmetry in Eq. (24) with C=τ0σz.
We now consider NH perturbations in class AIII, which
respect [7]
CH(k)C†=−H(k)†. (26)
As in the 2D phases considered before, we again impose
pseudo-inversion symmetry in Eq. (4) with I=τyσx.
As an example of NH perturbations that preserve both
chiral and pseudo-inversion symmetries, we study
H(k) =vkxτzσx+vkyτ0σy+δτ0σx+ iv′kxτ0σ0(27)9
with δ, v′∈R. Here, the Hermitian perturbation δτ0σx
shifts the Dirac point at each surface, and the NH per-
turbation i v′kxτ0σ0results in an imaginary-valued energy
dispersion. As a combination of these perturbations, a
point gap opens around E= 0. In fact, the complex
spectrum is obtained as
E(k) =±vq
(kxτ+δ/v)2+k2y+ iv′kx, (28)
where τ= +1 ( τ=−1) corresponds to the top (bottom)
surface [Fig. 6 (a)]. Importantly, the NH Dirac surface
modes exhibit the nontrivial topology in terms of the
point gap around E= 0. In general, 2D point-gapped
NH Hamiltonians H(k) with chiral symmetry are char-
acterized by the Chern number of the Hermitian matrix
iH(k)C[7]. For our NH Dirac surface Hamiltonian, we
have
iH(k)C=vkxτzσy−vkyτ0σx+δτ0σy−v′kxτ0σz,(29)
which reduces to a continuum limit of a Hermitian Chern
insulator and hence yields C(0) = −sgn (δvv′). More-
over, the only local and k-independent NH perturbations
to Eq. (25) allowed by symmetry read +i m1τ0σz, which
does not open a gap in i H(k)C, and +i m2τzσ0, which
again results in |C|= 1. Correspondingly, we find the
general relation
C(0) = W(mod 2) (30)
between the 3D Hermitian topological invariant Win
class AIII and the 2D NH topological invariant C(0) in
class AIII, evaluated at the reference energy E= 0 within
the point gap as fixed by chiral symmetry (Tab. II).
In contrast to the complex-spectral winding number in
Eq. (3) and its Z2counterpart in Eq. (19), this point-gap
topological invariant has an analog in the line-gap topol-
ogy and does not lead to the skin effect. In fact, un-
der the open boundary conditions along the y-direction,
the boundaries host the chiral hinge states with the
imaginary-valued dispersion
E(kx) = iv′kx, (31)
which are protected by the point gap and chiral sym-
metry [Figs. 5 (c) and 6 (b)]. We note that while chiral
symmetry can also be generalized to NH Hamiltonians
by Eq. (24), which corresponds to class AIII†, Eq. (24)
cannot give rise to any point-gap topology in 2D [7].
B. Lattice model
We also confirm the above continuum theory by the
NH lattice model in 3D,
H(k) = [m+t1(coskx+ cos ky+ cos kz)]τyσ0
+t2τx[(sinkx)σx+ (sin ky)σy+ (sin kz)σz]

open boundary conditions along the (a) z-direction and (b) y
andz-directions [ v=v′=δ= 1.0 in Eq. (27)]. The or-

Dirac surface modes at the different boundaries along the
z-direction, and the blue line denotes the spectrum of the
chiral hinge modes E(kx) = i v′kx. (c, d) Complex spectra

Eq. (32)]. The system sizes are chosen as (c) 200 ×200×30
sites and (d) 200 ×30×30 sites.
with t1,t2,m,δ,γ∈R. This NH lattice model re-
spects chiral symmetry in Eq. (26) with C=τzσ0and
pseudo-inversion symmetry in Eq. (4) with I=τyσ0.
The complex spectrum for PBC is obtained as
E(k) = (33)
±q
[∆(k)±δ(coskx+ cos ky)]2+t2
2sin2ky+ iγsinkx,
with ∆( k):= [(m+t1(coskx+ cos ky+ cos kz))2+
t2
2(sin2kx+ sin2kz)]1/2. The real line gap at Re E= 0
is open for δ=γ= 0 and remains open for small δand
γ. For δ=γ= 0, the 3D winding number is obtained as
|W|= 2 for |m|<|t1|,|W|= 1 for |t1|<|m|<3|t1|,
and|W|= 0 for 3 |t1|<|m|[53]. Consequently, for
|t1|<|m|<3|t1|(|m|<|t1|), one flavor (two flavors) of
Dirac surface modes appears under OBC, which reduce
to Eq. (25) around Re E= 0.
We obtain the complex spectrum under OBC along the
z-direction [Fig. 6 (c)]. We note that no skin effect occurs
in this model. As a consequence of the nonzero 3D wind-
ing number in the bulk, the Dirac surface states appear
at each boundary along the z-direction. Here, an exten-10
sive number of eigenstates are delocalized through the
bulk, and the Dirac surface modes are generally delocal-
ized in the xyplane but localized at the boundaries along
thez-direction. Owing to the NH perturbations for δ̸= 0
andγ̸= 0, the line-gapless points of the two Dirac surface
modes at the different boundaries are shifted, and a point
gap is open around E= 0, consistent with the continuum
theory. Furthermore, these NH Dirac surface modes ex-
hibit the nontrivial point-gap topology, i.e., a nonzero
Chern number |C(0)|= 1 of i H(k)C. Consequently, chi-
ral hinge modes appear under OBC along both yand
z-directions [Fig. 6 (d)]. The chiral hinge modes due to
the NH point-gap topology are delocalized only along the
x-direction and localized in the yzplane.
C. Dimensional reduction
The imaginary-valued dispersion of chiral hinge modes
in Eq. (31) is closely related to the anomalous dispersion
of an isolated exceptional point [17–20] via dimensional
reduction. To see this, let us consider a four-dimensional
(4D) Chern insulator [54, 55] with non-Hermiticity in a
similar manner to the previous cases for 2D and 3D topo-
logical phases. Under OBC along one direction, each
boundary hosts a single Weyl mode
H0(k) =v(kxτzσx+kyτ0σy+kzτ0σz), (34)
where τz= +1 ( τz=−1) denotes the top (bottom)
boundary.
As a possible choice of NH perturbations that preserve
locality and pseudo-inversion symmetry with I=τyσx,
we consider
H(k) =v(kxτzσx+kyτ0σy+kzτ0σz)
+δτ0σx+ iv′kxτ0σ0.(35)
These perturbations shift the Weyl points and open a
point gap around E= 0, akin to the 2D NH Dirac sur-
face modes considered in Eq. (27). In general, 3D NH
systems are characterized by the 3D winding number W3
of the complex spectrum [7]. Around the reference energy
E= 0, the above NH Weyl Hamiltonian indeed realizes
W3̸= 0, which leads to the emergence of the anomalous
boundary modes [17–20]
E(k) = ikx+kz (36)
under OBC along the y-direction. This complex-valued
energy dispersion coincides with that of an exceptional
point. Importantly, if we perform a dimensional reduc-
tion by setting kz= 0 in the 4D Chern insulator and 3D
NH Weyl modes, and further impose chiral symmetry in
Eq. (26), the complex-valued dispersion in Eq. (36) re-
duces to the imaginary-valued dispersion in Eq. (31). In
this manner, the higher-order boundary modes protected
by the boundary point-gap topology in different spatial
dimensions are related to each other via dimensional re-
duction. While such a dimensional hierarchy is similarto that in Hermitian topological phases [2–4, 53, 55–57],
the interplay of point gaps and line gaps, as well as the
bifurcation of symmetry, enriches the boundary physics
of NH topological phases.
V. 3D Z2-CLASSIFIED TOPOLOGICAL
INSULATOR (CLASS AII)
3D Hermitian systems can generally host Z2topologi-
cal phases in classes AII and CII, in which time-reversal
symmetry in Eq. (13) with T2=−1 is respected. Simi-
larly to the Ztopological phase protected by chiral sym-
metry in Sec. IV, Dirac surface modes appear on each
boundary for OBC along the z-direction, so that the low-
energy Hamiltonian is Eq. (25) with time-reversal sym-
metry T= iτ0σyK. In contrast to the previous case, the
Dirac point is fixed at the time-reversal-invariant mo-
mentum and cannot be shifted by symmetry-preserving
perturbations, consistent with the Z2topological phase.
In particular, the perturbation δτ0σxin Eq. (27) breaks
time-reversal symmetry and is forbidden in the presence
of time-reversal symmetry.
Note that no point-gap topology is well defined in 2D
class AII, in contrast to 2D class AII†[7]. We therefore
consider NH perturbations in class AII†, in which time-
reversal symmetry†in Eq. (14) is respected. The generic
perturbed NH Hamiltonian in class AII†that preserves
locality and pseudo-inversion symmetry reads
H(k) =vkxτzσx+vkyτ0σy+ iγτzσ0 (37)
with γ∈R. The NH perturbation i γτzσ0opens a point
gap for E= 0, around which the Z2topological invariant
takes a nontrivial value, ν(0) = 1 [7]. Since this is the
only symmetry-allowed constant NH perturbation, the
2DZ2topological invariant ν(E) of the Dirac surface
states in the slab geometry (OBC only in one direction)
satisfies
ν(EF) =ν (38)
for a NH system in class AII†that is point-gapped at EF
and preserves pseudo-inversion symmetry (Tab. II).
Importantly, this Z2topological invariant is intrinsic
to NH systems and leads to the skin effect, in contrast to
theZtopological invariant protected by chiral symmetry
that has a counterpart in anti-Hermitian systems and
hence leads to the emergence of chiral hinge modes. The
skin effect is unique to 2D systems and can be probed
by adding a magnetic flux [9, 58]. Here, when we reduce
the spatial dimension along the y-direction, the NH Dirac
surface modes in Eq. (37) reduce to the NH helical edge
modes in Eq. (18). Correspondingly, the skin effect can
also be understood by dimensional reduction.11
VI. GENERAL CLASSIFICATION
While we have so far studied some prototypical models,
our discussions can be generalized to arbitrary symme-
try classes and spatial dimensions. For Hermitian sys-
tems in each dimension, ZandZ2topological phases ap-
pear in 5 symmetry classes out of the 10 AZ symmetry
classes [2–4, 53, 56, 57]. As also discussed before, each
AZ symmetry in Hermitian systems has different gener-
alizations in NH systems, which culminate in the 38-fold
symmetry classification [7, 59, 60]. Notably, boundary
modes in Hermitian topological insulators and supercon-
ductors always exhibit nontrivial point-gap topology in
the presence of NH perturbations in the AZ†symmetry
classes, in which time-reversal and chiral symmetries are
defined by Eqs. (14) and (26), respectively. This general
correspondence exists because the classification of point-
gap topology in ( d−1) dimensions for an AZ†symmetry
class coincides with that of Hermitian topology in ddi-
mensions for the corresponding AZ symmetry class [7].
This relationship was previously applied to dynamical
phenomena of NH systems [61, 62]. On the other hand,
in the presence of NH perturbations in the AZ symmetry
classes, in which time-reversal and chiral symmetries are
respectively defined by Eqs. (13) and (26), 3 classes out
of the 5 classes can exhibit nontrivial point-gap topology.
Here, using continuum Dirac Hamiltonians, we ex-
plicitly derive the mapping between the Hermitian bulk
topology and NH boundary topology in 2D and 3D for
all the remaining AZ symmetry classes, as summarized in
Tabs. I and II. Some symmetry classes exhibit NH topol-
ogy different from the models studied in Secs. II, III, IV,
and V. For example, in 2D class D and 3D class DIII, no
point gap is allowed to be open because of the Hermitian
topology in the bulk. In addition, in 3D class CII†, NH
boundary topology can lead to the emergence of helical
hinge modes protected by point-gap topology. It is also
notable that the classification in arbitrary dimensions is
related to each other via dimensional reduction; the gen-
eralization to higher dimensions is also straightforward.
A. 2D Class D
The topological invariant of 2D Hermitian systems in
class D is the Chern number C∈Z, similar to 2D class A
(see Sec. II). For the simplest nontrivial case C= 1, the
low-energy continuum Hamiltonian in the slab geometry
is therefore given by
H0(kx) =vkxτz, (39)
which satisfies particle-hole symmetry:
PH0(k)P†=−H0(−k), (40)
withP=τ0K. We choose τ0rather than τzin the defi-
nition of Pbecause particle-hole symmetry is an internal
symmetry that is unaffected by spatial transformations
such as those that exchange the two edges.1. NH class D
NH systems in class D are defined to respect
PH0(k)P†=−H†
0(−k), (41)
with an antiunitary operation Pthat satisfies P2= 1.
Notably, Eq. (39), which describes one chiral mode per
edge, cannot become real-line-gapped under any pertur-
bations that preserve locality. In fact, for the case with
C= 1, even a point gap cannot open. Keeping the defini-
tionP=τ0K, the only NH mass term for Eq. (39) that
satisfies Eq. (41) is i mτy, which couples the two edges
and is therefore nonlocal.
ForC= 2, on the other hand, two pairs of chiral edge
modes appear in the slab geometry, which read
H0(kx) =vkxτzσ0. (42)
Here, the Pauli matrices σidescribe the two flavors of chi-
ral modes at each edge. In this case, the generic NH per-
turbations that preserve particle-hole symmetry, pseudo-
inversion symmetry, and locality are
H(kx) =vkxτzσ0+ ibτzσy (43)
with b∈R. The complex spectrum is obtained as
E(kx) =τ(vkx+ ibσ), (44)
where τ= +1 ( τ=−1) denotes the chiral edge modes
at the top (bottom) boundary, and σ= +1 ( σ=−1)
denotes the different flavors of the chiral edge modes at
each boundary. Notably, a point gap is open around
E= 0 for b̸= 0, which contrasts with the previous case
forC= 1. This should be related to the Z2classification
of both point-gap and line-gap topology in 1D class D [7].
2. NH class D†
We now consider NH perturbations in class D†. This
symmetry class is characterized by the particle-hole con-
straint in Eq. (40), and the allowed NH perturbations
are
H(kx) = iaτ0+ (vkx+ ib)τz, (45)
with a, b∈R. In contrast to class D, a point gap is open
in class D†. Again, pseudo-inversion symmetry I=τx
results in a= 0 and protects a nonzero winding number
|W(0)|= 1 for b̸= 0. In a similar manner to 2D class A
in Sec. II, we find that the 1D winding number W(E) of
the chiral edge states in the slab geometry (OBC only in
one direction) satisfies
W(0) = C(mod 2) , (46)
this time for a NH system in class D†that is point-gapped
atE= 0 and preserves pseudo-inversion symmetry.12
B. 2D Class DIII
We have seen in Sec. VI A that the addition of particle-
hole symmetry Pto class A, which results in Hermitian
class D and NH class D†, does not change the derivation
of the boundary spectral winding in Sec. II. Similarly, the
derivation in Sec. III is fully compatible with additional
particle-hole symmetry P=τ0σ0Kthat upgrades Her-
mitian class AII to Hermitian class DIII and NH class
AII†to NH class DIII†, respectively. As a consequence,
we again find that the 1D Z2topological invariant ν(E)
of the helical edge states in the slab geometry satisfies
ν(0) = ν (47)
this time for a NH system in class DIII†that is point-
gapped at E= 0 and preserves pseudo-inversion symme-
try.
C. 2D Class C
The minimal nontrivial topological phase of 2D Her-
mitian systems in class C is an insulator or a gapped
superconductor with the Chern number C= 2, which
has two co-propagating chiral edge modes in the slab ge-
ometry described by [cf. Eq. (5)]
H0(kx) =vkxτzσ0. (48)
This Hamiltonian satisfies particle-hole symmetry in
Eq. (40) with P=τ0σyK. In contrast to class D, the
particle-hole operation in class C satisfies P2=−1.
We now consider NH perturbations in class C†, because
this is the only NH generalization of Hermitian class C
that allows for nontrivial point-gap topology in 1D [7].
This symmetry class is characterized by the particle-hole
constraint in Eq. (40), and the allowed NH perturbations
are
H(kx) = iaτ0σ0+ (vkx+ ib)τzσ0, (49)
with a, b∈R. Again, pseudo-inversion symmetry I=
τxσ0results in a= 0 and protects the nonzero winding
number |W(0)|= 2 for b̸= 0.
We next study a system with the Chern number C= 4.
At low energies and in the slab geometry, the system
hosts two pairs of the chiral edge states described by
H0(kx) =vkxτzσ0ρ0, (50)
where ρi(i= 0, x, y, z ) is another set of Pauli matrices
that acts on the different flavors of the chiral modes at
each edge. Particle-hole symmetry is now represented by
P=τ0σyρ0K. One example of NH perturbations in class
C†is given by
H0(kx) =vkxτzσ0ρ0+ iaτzσ0ρ0+ ibτzσ0ρz, (51)
with a, b∈R. For a > 0 and b= 0, we now obtain
W(0) = 4, while for a= 0 and b >0, we obtain W(0) =0. Hence, pseudo-inversion symmetry allows us to fix the
boundary winding number only modulo 4.
As a consequence, the 1D NH winding number W(E)
of the pairs of the chiral edge modes in the slab geometry
(OBC only in one direction) satisfies
W(0) = C(mod 4) (52)
for a NH system in class C†that is point-gapped at E= 0
and preserves pseudo-inversion symmetry.
D. 3D class DIII
Similarly to class AIII, the topological invariant of
3D Hermitian systems in class DIII is the 3D winding
number W∈Z. Correspondingly, for the simplest non-
trivial case W= 1, the low-energy continuum Hamilto-
nian in the slab geometry is given as the Dirac surface
modes in Eq. (25), which respect time-reversal symme-
try in Eq. (13) with T= iτ0σyKand chiral symmetry
in Eq. (24) with C=τ0σz. Class DIII in Hermitian sys-
tems can be generalized to NH systems in two manners,
classes DIII and DIII†[7]. As shown below, while the
topological invariant Win the 3D bulk leads to point-
gap ingappability in class DIII, it induces a skin effect or
the emergence of chiral hinge modes in class DIII†.
1. NH class DIII
NH systems in class DIII are defined to respect time-
reversal symmetry in Eq. (13) and chiral symmetry in
Eq. (26). Similar to the NH chiral edge modes in 2D
class D, no point gap can open in the NH Dirac sur-
face modes in class DIII with W= 1. More specifically,
the generic NH Dirac surface modes that preserve time-
reversal and chiral symmetries, as well as locality and
pseudo-inversion symmetry with I=τyσx, are of the
form
H(k) =vkxτzσx+vkyτ0σy+ iγτ0σz (53)
with γ∈R. The spectrum is obtained as
E(k) =±q
v2k2x+v2k2y−γ2, (54)
which exhibits a loop of exceptional points at k2
x+k2
y=
(γ/v)2in momentum space and possesses no point or line
gaps.
2. NH class DIII†
In class DIII†, NH systems are defined to respect time-
reversal symmetry†in Eq. (14) and chiral symmetry in
Eq. (26). In general, such systems are characterized by
aZtopological invariant [i.e., Chern number C(0) of the13
Hermitian Hamiltonian i H(k)Cevaluated for the refer-
ence energy E= 0] in the presence of a point gap [7].
IfC(0) is odd, the skin effect occurs [9, 20]. On the
other hand, even C(0) does not lead to the skin effect
but the appearance of chiral hinge modes. Consequently,
the surface Dirac cone in Eq. (25) in class DIII†, which
corresponds to C(0) = ±1, only exhibits the skin effect
rather than chiral hinge modes. Specifically, the only NH
perturbation in class DIII†preserving pseudo-inversion
symmetry with I=τyσxis
H(k) =vkxτzσx+vkyτ0σy+ iγτzσ0, (55)
with γ∈R. Notably, this NH Dirac surface Hamiltonian
has a net nonzero Chern number of C(0) = 1. This leads
to the skin effect that is unique to 2D systems and can
be probed by a magnetic flux [9, 58].
On the other hand, when the original 3D topologi-
cal insulator exhibits the 3D winding number W= 2,
two different flavors of the Dirac surface modes appear
at each boundary. These Dirac surface modes could in
principle yield a Chern number of C(0) = 2 protected
by chiral symmetry, which would result in two flavors of
chiral hinge modes under OBC. However, such an even
number of the Chern number cannot be fixed solely by
pseudo-inversion symmetry—there are other symmetry-
preserving perturbations that lead to C(0) = 0—so that
we can only deduce
C(0) = W(mod 2) (56)
in general.
E. 3D class CI
The minimal nontrivial topological phase of 3D Her-
mitian systems in class CI is a gapped superconductor
with the winding number W= 2 that hosts two Dirac
surface modes, so that the low-energy slab Hamiltonian
reads
H0(k) =v(kxτzσx+kyτ0σy)ρ0. (57)
This Dirac Hamiltonian satisfies particle-hole symmetry
in Eq. (40) with P= iτ0σxρyKand chiral symmetry in
Eq. (24) with C=τ0σzρ0. Notably, this is a pair of the
Dirac surface modes in Eq. (25) with the same chirality.
We now consider NH perturbations in class CI†, be-
cause this is the only NH generalization of class CI that
allows for nontrivial point-gap topology in 2D [7]. One
possible choice of NH perturbations that preserve time-
reversal and chiral symmetries, as well as locality and
pseudo-inversion symmetry with I=τyσxρ0, is
H(k) =v(kxτzσx+kyτ0σy)ρ0
+τ0(δσx+ iv′kxσ0)ρz (58)
with δ, v′∈R. This NH Dirac surface Hamiltonian pos-
sesses a point gap around E= 0, for which the Chernnumber of i H(k)Cis nontrivial, i.e., |C(0)|= 2. As
a consequence, it hosts the two flavors of chiral hinge
modes with the imaginary-valued dispersion in Eq. (31).
Moreover, the only local and k-independent NH per-
turbations to Eq. (57) allowed by symmetry are of the
form +i m1,iτ0σzρi(i=x, y, z ), which do not open a
gap in i H(k)C(i.e., they are not Dirac mass terms), and
+im2τzσ0ρ0, which again results in |C(0)|= 2. In con-
clusion, the 2D Chern number C(0) of the NH Dirac
surface modes in the slab geometry (OBC only in one
direction) must satisfy
C(0) = W(mod 4) (59)
for a NH system in class CI†that is point-gapped at
E= 0 and preserves pseudo-inversion symmetry.
F. 3D class CII
The nontrivial topological phase of 3D Hermitian sys-
tems in class CII is characterized by a Z2invariant ν= 1.
The low-energy Dirac Hamiltonian at the boundaries of
such a system is
H0(k) =v(kxτzσx+kyτ0σy)ρx, (60)
which respects chiral symmetry in Eq. (24) with C=
τ0σ0ρzand time-reversal symmetry in Eq. (13) with
T= iτ0σyρ0K. While 2D NH point-gapped systems
in class CII are classified by a 2 Ztopological invariant,
those in class CII†are classified only by a Z2topologi-
cal invariant. Owing to this difference, an even number
of chiral hinge modes appear in class CII, while helical
hinge modes appear in class CII†, as shown below.
1. NH class CII
We first consider NH perturbations in class CII, which
are defined to respect time-reversal symmetry in Eq. (13)
and chiral symmetry in Eq. (26). One possible choice of
NH perturbations that preserve time-reversal and chiral
symmetries, as well as locality and pseudo-inversion sym-
metry with I=τyσxρx, is
H(k) =v(kxτzσx+kyτ0σy)ρx
+τ0(δσyρy+ iv′kxσ0ρ0) (61)
with δ, v′∈R. This NH Dirac surface Hamiltonian pos-
sesses a point gap for E= 0, around which the Chern
number of i H(k)Cis nontrivial, i.e., |C(0)|= 2. As a
consequence, it hosts two flavors of chiral hinge modes
with the imaginary-valued dispersion in Eq. (31).
Moreover, the only local and k-independent NH per-
turbations to Eq. (60) allowed by symmetry are of
the form i m1τ0σxρz, im2τ0σyρ0, im3τ0σzρ0, im4τzσxρ0,
im5τzσyρz, im6τzσzρz. Of these, only the last serves as
a Dirac mass in i H(k)Cand leads to C(0) =±2, and the14
remaining terms do not open a gap. In conclusion, the
2D Chern number C(0) of the NH Dirac surface modes
in the slab geometry (OBC only in one direction) must
satisfy
C(0) = 2 ν(mod 4) (62)
for a NH system in class CII that is point-gapped at
E= 0 and preserves pseudo-inversion symmetry.
2. NH class CII†
We next consider NH perturbations in class CII†,
which are defined to respect time-reversal symmetry†
in Eq. (14) and chiral symmetry in Eq. (26). Be-
cause of time-reversal symmetry†for the NH Hamil-
tonian H(k), the Hermitian matrix i H(k)Calso re-
spects time-reversal symmetry and hence must have the
vanishing Chern number. Instead, i H(k)Chosts the
well-defined Z2topological invariant protected by time-
reversal symmetry†[7]. In fact, one possible choice of
NH perturbations in class CII†forI=τyσxρxreads
H(k) =v(kxτzσx+kyτ0σy)ρx
+τ0(δσyρy+ iv′kxσzρz).(63)
This NH Dirac surface Hamiltonian possesses a point gap
around E= 0, and we have
iH(k)C=vkxτzσxρy+vkyτ0σyρy
−δτ0σyρx−v′kxτ0σzρ0, (64)
which exhibits the nontrivial Z2invariant ν(0) = 1 eval-
uated for the reference energy E= 0 as fixed by chiral
symmetry. Correspondingly, under OBC along both y
andz-directions, the NH Dirac surface modes host the
helical hinge modes
H(kx) = iv′kxτ0σz. (65)
Moreover, the only local and k-independent NH pertur-
bations to Eq. (60) allowed by symmetry are now of the
form i m1τ0σ0ρzand i m2τzσ0ρ0. Of these, the first one
does not open a gap in i H(k)Cwhile the second term
again results in ν(0) = 1. In conclusion, the 2D Z2topo-
logical invariant ν(0) of the NH Dirac surface modes in
the slab geometry (OBC only in one direction) must sat-
isfy
ν(0) = ν (66)
for a NH system in class CII†that is point-gapped at
E= 0 and preserves pseudo-inversion symmetry.
VII. DISCUSSION
Perturbing a gapped Hermitian system with small NH
terms generally results in a line-gapped spectrum thatcan be adiabatically deformed back to the Hermitian
limit. To realize intrinsic NH topology, one must there-
fore perturb a gapless system or make sure that the NH
terms are significantly larger than the gap energy scale.
We have found that Hermitian topological phases allow
us to avoid such fine tuning because they are guaranteed
to host gapless states on their boundaries. Moreover, we
have shown that the resulting boundary NH topological
invariants are determined by the bulk Hermitian invari-
ants in the presence of pseudo-inversion symmetry.
Besides generalizing our framework to other spatial
symmetries beyond pseudo-inversion symmetry, a nat-
ural follow-up question is to consider the effect of NH
perturbations on the gapless boundary states of topologi-
cal crystalline insulators. For instance, NH perturbations
should transform the gapless hinge states of second-order
3D topological insulators and superconductors into third-
order skin effects appearing at the corners of samples
terminated in all three directions. It is also worthwhile
to study NH boundary topology in Floquet topological
insulators [63].
Another natural question is to investigate boundary
NH topology from a field-theoretic perspective. For in-
stance, each edge of a Chern insulator in the presence
of NH perturbations (Sec. II) realizes half of a Hatano-
Nelson chain [39, 40] and cannot be regularized in a
1D lattice system. Here, the presence of the chiral
edge states is supported by the quantum anomaly of the
Hermitian bulk system in 2D. On the other hand, the
complex-spectral winding number and the concomitant
skin effect are relevant to another quantum anomaly that
is unique to NH systems and formulated in terms of spa-
tial, rather than spatiotemporal, degrees of freedom [19].
It is of interest to study the interplay of these two types
of quantum anomaly.
After the initial submission of this work, the corner
skin effect of chiral edge modes in a NH Chern insula-
tor was experimentally observed in a lossy gyromagnetic
photonic crystal [64]. Other NH models in our work,
such as the 3D model studied in Sec. IV, should also
be realizable in similar open classical and quantum syn-
thetic materials. Furthermore, our work is also relevant
to topological insulators and superconductors in solid-
state materials. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the
NH topology and concomitant skin effect were recently
demonstrated in the conductance matrix for the meso-
scopic edge transport of a quantum Hall device [65].
Note added.— In the final stages of completion of this
work, we became aware of a recent related work [66]. This
related work investigates the skin effect of a chiral edge
mode in a NH Chern insulator, which is consistent with
our discussions in Sec. II. We also note another related
work [67] that appeared after the submission of this work.
Our results are consistent where they overlap.15

Appendix A: Relation between Chern higher-order
NH skin effect and Hermitian fragile topology
We here give an equivalent proof of the higher-order
skin effect in NH Chern insulators that only relies on bulk
topology and does not make use of the slab geometry.
Consider a Chern insulator with C̸= 0 (mod 2) that
is gapped at the Fermi energy EF. We now show that
taking into account pseudo-inversion symmetry
IH(k)I†=H(−k)†,I2= 1, (A1)
implies that a second-order skin effect must occur as long
as the point gap at EFis open. For this, we note that
the extended Hermitian Hamiltonian
¯H(k) =0 H(k)
H(k)†0
(A2)
inherits conventional inversion symmetry
¯I=
0I
I0
,¯I¯H(k)¯I†=¯H(−k). (A3)
Moreover, ¯H(k) always enjoys chiral (sublattice) symme-
try
¯Σ =
10
0−1
,¯Σ¯H(k)¯Σ†=−¯H(k). (A4)
by construction.
¯Isymmetry gives rise to a Z4-valued symmetry indi-
cator topological invariant [68]
¯κ="
2¯nocc+1
2X
k∈HSMsX
n∈occ¯λn(k)#
(mod 4) ,(A5)where ¯ noccis the number of occupied bands, HSMs
are the four inversion-symmetric (“high-symmetry”) mo-
menta of the 2D Brillouin zone, and ¯λn(k) are the ¯I-
eigenvalues of the occupied (negative-energy) eigenstates
of¯H(k). All trivial (atomic insulator) band structures
satisfy ¯ κ= 0. It is also known that the Chern number ¯C
of the extended Hamiltonian ¯H(k) satisfies
¯C= ¯κ(mod 2) , (A6)
so that the odd values ¯ κ= 1,3 must correspond to Chern
insulators. Moreover, if an insulator has ¯ κ= 2 but ¯C= 0,
it must belong to an inversion-protected fragile topolog-
ical phase , which hosts 2 + 4 l(l∈Z) corner states for
full OBC [35, 69]. Due to ¯Isymmetry, they appear at
opposite corners, and due to chiral symmetry [Eq. (A4)],
they are pinned to zero energy.
We now compute ¯ κin the situation where H(k) [but
not¯H(k)] realizes a Chern insulator with C̸= 0 (mod
2). For simplicity, we first adiabatically deform H(k) to
its Hermitian limit H(k)†=H(k). We may then rotate
to a basis where
¯H(k) =
H(k) 0
0−H(k)
,¯I=
I0
0−I
.(A7)
We see that the occupied subspace of ¯H(k) is formed
by the “occupied” subspace of H(k) (the states below
EF= 0), together with the “empty” subspace of H(k)
(the states above EF= 0). Importantly, for the latter set
of states, the sign of inversion is flipped. Since the sum of
occupied and empty subspaces of any lattice model has
vanishing Chern number, we deduce ¯C= 0. Moreover,
we compute
¯κ= 2κ= 2 (mod 4) , (A8)
where we use the fact that the symmetry indicator κof
H(k) must satisfy κ= 1 (mod 2) due to Eq. (A6).
Correspondingly, a model H(k) with C̸= 0 (mod 2)
and in the presence of pseudo-inversion symmetry has
an extended Hermitian Hamiltonian ¯H(k) that realizes
an inversion-symmetry-protected fragile phase with two
stable corner-localized zero modes. Since zero modes in
¯H(k) induce a skin effect in H(k) [9], we deduce that
H(k) has a higher-order skin effect due to its first-order
boundary-induced point gap topology. It is worthwhile
to further study the relevance of this discussion to the
second-order skin effects in Refs. 26, 30, and 31.
