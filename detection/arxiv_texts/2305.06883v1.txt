ABSTRACT
In online advertising (Ad), advertisers are always eager to know
how to globally optimize their budget allocation strategies across
different channels for more conversions such as orders, payments,
etc. Ignoring competition among different advertisers causes ob-
jective inconsistency, that is, a single advertiser locally optimizes
the conversions only based on its own historical statistics, which
is far behind the global conversions maximization. In this paper,
we present a cross-channel Advertising Coordinated budget alloca-
tion framework ( AdCob ) to globally optimize the budget allocation
strategy for overall conversions maximization. We are the first to
provide deep insight into modeling the competition among differ-
ent advertisers in cross-channel budget allocation problems. The
proposed iterative algorithm combined with entropy constraint is
fast to converge and easy to implement in large-scale online Ad sys-
tems. Both results from offline experiments and online A/B budget
bucketing experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AdCob .

1 INTRODUCTION
Budget management is essential for e-commerce search Advertising
(Ad) systems [ 2,3], which simultaneously and deeply impacts the
revenues of platforms and the performances of the advertisers [ 13].
As shown in Fig. 1(a), the overall traffic is composed of different
channels according to the Ad display-ends such as mobile, laptop,
etc. If advertisers do not heuristically distribute their budgets, the
Ad systems will roughly apply a first-come-first-served strategy.
Under this situation, a first-come channel with poor quality may pre-
empt the budgets of late-come channels with better quality, which
leads to a conversions decrease within limited budgets. Advertisers
are thus eager to know how to reasonably distribute their limited
budgets across different channels to obtain more conversions.
There is indeed some research working on optimizing the cross-
channel budget allocation strategy for a single advertiser [ 7,9,10,
21]. They assume that all the other advertisers are stationary, that
∗Both authors contributed equally to this research.
†Corresponding Authoris, maintaining their original allocation strategy. These works focus
on one advertiser and optimize one’s own conversions only based
on local historical statistics. None of them provide insights into
modeling the competition among different advertisers. Ignoring
this competition causes objective inconsistency , that is, the
Ad system is in a state of imperfect information competition. We
argue that under this situation, the Ad system will converge to
a local optimal point of an inconsistent objective. The local op-
timal point can be arbitrarily different from the global objective
depending upon the proportion of advertisers adopting a greedy
allocation strategy. Specifically, if most advertisers greedily allocate
their budgets to a small number of channels that they prefer, this
will lead to such channels being allocated excessive budgets which
may be beyond the upper bound that these channels can handle,
i.e., excessive competition (please refer to Fig. 1(e)). Such excessive
competition not only leads to increasing costs for advertisers who
have won the exposure opportunities in such channels but also lose
potential exposure chances in other channels.
In this paper, we focus on the prosperity of the market, coordi-
nating all advertisers (as shown in Fig. 1(c)) to optimize the global
budget strategy across different channels for overall conversion
maximization while maintaining platform revenue as much as pos-
sible. To solve this problem, we cast the overall budget allocation
problem as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem [ 6,14,16] and pro-
pose Advertising Co ordinated b udget allocation ( AdCob )ap-
proach, which satisfies the constraints of the advertiser’s budgets
and the channels’ cost upper limits at the same time1. As shown in
Fig. 1(d,e,f), based on the cost matrix2,AdCob "transfers" advertisers’
budgets to different channels with minimal "conversion cost" under
bilateral constraints, which is more in line with the global optimal
objective, i.e., global conversion maximization. Almost all the ad-
vertisers can enjoy a better utility as the unreasonable competition
(both excess and lack) is mitigated (Please refer to Fig. 1(f)). With
a controllable entropy variable, AdCob largely enhances objective
consistency while preserving high search efficiency by searching
space reduction [4, 11].
Our main contributions are summarized below:
•We propose the global cross-channel budget allocation and
cast it as Optimal Transport, which provides the first insight
into modeling the competition among different advertisers
and coordinating their budgets.
1The offline simulation first estimates the cost upper limits that different channels can
undertake in one budget period (please refer to Fig. 1(e,f) cost upper limit curve).
2As shown in Fig. 1(g), the averaged cost per conversion of a campaign on a channel
can be regarded as the cost matrix in the OT problem.arXiv:2305.06883v1  [cs.GT]  9 May 2023Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Guangyuan Shen, Shenjie Sun, Dehong Gao, Shaolei Li, Libin Yang, Yongping Shi, and Wei Ning

•We employ the iterative algorithm with entropy constraint
which accelerates the training convergence and ensures
large-scale implementation. Thanks to its simple framework,
AdCob can be easily deployed to other Ad systems with cross-
channel budget management needs.
•We have deployed the AdCob framework in an online adver-
tising system. The results from the offline experiments and
the online A/B budget-bucketing experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
2 RELATED WORK
A recent strand of literature has considered different aspects of bud-
get management in cross-channel Ad auctions. The main difference
to our work is that these works focus on a single advertiser, which
is different from our global advertiser coordination.
Earlier literature [ 21] introduces the Multiple- Choice Knapsack
(MCK) [ 12,15] model to solve the cross-channel budget allocation
of one single advertiser. Some researchers take traffic fluctuations
caused by time into consideration, and they cast the time-considered
allocation as a reinforcement learning-based MCK problem [ 7,10].
On this basis, the interactions among sub-campaigns3are modeled
in the allocation model [ 9]. All these methods ignore the inter-
actions among a tremendous number of advertisers, that is, only
working under the assumption that all the other advertisers keep
the static strategy. These methods seem not suitable for real online
Ad systems where millions of users bid to show their ads.
Besides, pacing methods are another series of budget manage-
ment focusing on how to allocate the budget over the time blocks
of a channel [ 19] or how to adjust the budget cost rate according
to the budget usage [ 1]. Pacing methods can also be regarded as
cross-channel budget allocation by distributing the budgets across
different time segmentations (channels).

3.1 Optimal Transport Problem
Optimal transport (OT) is the problem of moving goods from one
set of warehouses to another set of destinations while minimizing
certain cost functions [ 11] (please refer to Eq. 1). For example, sup-
pose that we have 𝑁warehouses (located by {𝑥𝑖}𝑁
𝑖=1), the number
of goods in each warehouse is {𝐺𝑖}𝑁
𝑖=1, and need to be moved to
𝑀different places (located by {𝑦𝑗}𝑀
𝑗=1). The quantity of demanded
goods of each destination is {𝐷𝑗}𝑀
𝑗=1, and the unit transportation
cost between the 𝑖𝑡ℎwarehouse and the 𝑗𝑡ℎdestination constructs
the cost matrix C,{𝑐(𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑗)}𝑁,𝑀
𝑖,𝑗=1. Then, the OT problem can be
formulated as follows,
𝐿=arg min
Γ𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝑀∑︁
𝑗=1Γ𝑖𝑗𝑐 𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑗(1)
𝑠.𝑡.∀𝑖∈{1,..,𝑁}∑︁
𝑗Γ𝑖𝑗=𝐺𝑖
∀𝑗∈{1,..,𝑀}∑︁
𝑖Γ𝑖𝑗=𝐷𝑗
where Γis the transport matrix to optimize, and Γ𝑖𝑗denotes the
number of goods sent from the 𝑖𝑡ℎwarehouse to the 𝑗𝑡ℎdestination.
Moreover, we must haveÍ
𝑖𝐺𝑖=Í
𝑗𝐷𝑗, since the total quantity
of goods will not change. If we are in the unbalance situation
whereÍ
𝑖𝐺𝑖≤Í
𝑗𝐷𝑗, we can set a virtual warehouse (located in
𝑥𝑖+1) with|Í
𝑖𝐺𝑖−Í
𝑗𝐷𝑗|goods stored in. When we set the cost
between the(𝑁+1)𝑡ℎwarehouse and the 𝑗𝑡ℎdestination equal to 0,
i.e.,∀𝑗,𝑐(𝑥𝑖+1,𝑗)=0, we can convert the unbalance OT to balance.
3.2 Budget Allocation via Optimal Transport
In an online Ad system, advertisers are allowed to create Ad cam-
paigns and the budget allocation in this paper refers to the budget al-
location of each campaign. We reformulate the global cross-channel
budget allocation as an unbalanced OT. Campaigns’ budgets areCross-channel Budget Coordination for
Online Advertising System Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY
viewed as the goods in warehouses while the channel cost upper
limits are viewed as the demanded goods at each destination.
Suppose that we have 𝑁Ad campaigns with budgets 𝒃:={𝑏𝑖}𝑁
𝑖=1,
and have𝑀channels with different daily cost upper limits 𝒉:=
{ℎ𝑗}𝑀
𝑗=1(the cost upper limit estimation refers to Sec. 4.1). We try
to maximize the number of conversions by optimizing the budget
allocation matrix P:={P𝑖,𝑗}𝑁,𝑀
𝑖=1,𝑗=1, where P𝑖,𝑗denotes the budget
that the𝑖𝑡ℎcampaign distributes to the 𝑗𝑡ℎchannel. When the
total budget is fixed, the objective converts to minimize the global
CPC ( CostPerConversion), i.e., minimize the linear combination of
different CPC𝑖,𝑗with weight P𝑖,𝑗. Here C:={CPC i,j}𝑁,𝑀
𝑖=1,𝑗=1denotes
the CPC of the 𝑖𝑡ℎcampaign on the 𝑗𝑡ℎchannel (please refer to
Eq. 2). Faced with the sparse nature of Ad conversion action, the
calculation of the cost matrix is difficult (for more details, please
refer to Sec. 4.2). Moreover, in practice, the sum of the cost upper
limits of all channels is always greater than the sum of all the
budgets. We can make up a virtual campaign with virtual budget
𝑏𝑁+1:=|Í
𝑖𝑏𝑖−Í
𝑗ℎ𝑗|to bridge the budget gap and simply set
the CPC of this campaign on each channel as 0, i.e., ∀𝑗,C𝑁+1,𝑗:=
CPC𝑁+1,𝑗=0. The formal problem formulation is as follows:
𝐿=arg min
P𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝑀∑︁
𝑗=1P𝑖,𝑗C𝑖,𝑗 (2)
𝑠.𝑡.∀𝑖∈{1,..,𝑁+1}∑︁
𝑗P𝑖,𝑗=𝑏𝑖
∀𝑗∈{1,..𝑀}∑︁
𝑖P𝑖,𝑗=ℎ𝑗
Obviously, this is a large-scale linear programming problem with
tremendous numbers of constraints. The complexity of the greedy
solution isO(𝑁3𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑁)[11], the iteration speed is too slow to meet
the model iteration requirements of large-scale Ad scenarios.
3.3 Iterative Solution with Entropy Constraint
The problem in Eq. 2 is a special linear programming problem,
and advanced linear programming solving algorithms can be used
to solve it. However, when faced with such large-scale problems
in online Ad, the advanced algorithm based on the interior point
method [ 8] still has great limitations [ 11]. Some researchers served
that, the problem above can be solved in a practical and scalable
way by adding an entropy penalty and using the matrix scaling
Sinkhorn algorithm [4]. The new objective of the problem is

where entropy H(P):=−Í
𝑖Í
𝑗P𝑖,𝑗(log(P𝑖,𝑗)−1), and𝜖is the
coefficient of entropy regularization. Since the objective in Eq. 3 is
an𝜖-strongly convex function, it has a unique optimal solution [ 11].
Introducing two dual variables f∈R𝑁+1,g∈R𝑀for each marginal
constraint, the Lagrangian of Eq. 3 reads

the solution Pbudget allocation matrix satisfies the bilateral con-
straints. We alternately satisfy the campaigns’ budget constraints
and channel cost upper limit constraints by alternately iterating
the sequences{𝑓𝑙}and{𝑔𝑙}, respectively.
The𝜖controls the strength of the regularization. As the 𝜖goes to
zero, more accurate solutions can be obtained while the campaign’s
budget will be centrally allocated to certain channels bringing nu-
merical instability. We present the auction results with different 𝜖
parameters in the experiment part, please refer to Sec. 5.1.4 .
4 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
4.1 Estimated Cost Upper Limit
We use an offline simulated auction system [ 17] to estimate the
cost upper limit of each channel. By removing budget constraints
for all Ad requests, all matching campaigns will be recalled as the
impression candidate, and the bidding, uGSP auction [ 5,18,20] will
be executed in order. The average cost of each channel in the past
30 days is counted as the estimated cost upper limit of the channel.
4.2 Estimate Cost Matrix
For large-scale model deployment, we make statistics of the 30 days
CPC of a campaign on a channel as the cost C𝑖,𝑗to construct the
cost matrix C𝑖,𝑗:=CPC𝑖,𝑗=𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 30𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑖,𝑗
𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 30𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑖,𝑗. In practice,
we face two challenges and the corresponding solutions are
•Conversion actions are inherently sparse , i.e, there are
many campaign-channel pairs possessing no conversion ac-
tion. We use a combination of estimated conversion rate and
real conversion to count the number of conversions, so as to
alleviate the sparsity of the conversion itself.
•Partial cold start campaign , i.e., some Ad campaigns have
no cost on some channels. We use the average cost per con-
version of the Ad campaign itself as its cost matrix
5 EXPERIMENT
5.1 Offline Setting.
We experimentally evaluate our cross-channel budget allocation
method ( AdCob ) in an offline setting using a simulated auctionConference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Guangyuan Shen, Shenjie Sun, Dehong Gao, Shaolei Li, Libin Yang, Yongping Shi, and Wei Ning
system [ 17] and real-world datasets collected from our real online
advertising system without any sampling.
5.1.1 Baselines. Apart from the plainest first-come-first-served
(FCFS) method, two other relevant budget allocation methods termed
IDIL [ 9] and unified budget allocation [ 21] have been introduced to
our experiments. All these prior methods focus on only one adver-
tiser, so we directly use these budget allocation methods for 40 %,
80%advertisers, regardless of whether these advertisers will gen-
erate unreasonable competition, resulting in a decline in platform
revenue. In addition, we did small treatments on them, for example:
•IDIL [ 9]: we ignore the strategy of allocating different bud-
gets on different days since we focus on cross-channel budget
allocation in this paper.
•Unified budget allocation [ 21]: We use a linear model to
approximate the ROI curve.
5.1.2 Data set. We evaluate our method with an advertising data
set that was collected from a real-world Internet e-commerce com-
pany, where all advertises compete for more conversion, such as
purchase behavior, and inquiry behavior. The real dataset covers
nearly two hundred thousand campaigns. The real dataset contains
tens of millions of records with the following auction information:
•Predicted ClickThrough Rate (pCTR), predicted ConVersion
Rate (pCVR) that describe user preferences for different
items, predicted by Deep Interest Network [22].
•Real bid price, generated by OCPC [ 23] bidding strategy
based on pCTR, pCVR, etc.
•Click action, click or not.
•Conversion action, conversion or not.
•Advertiser overall budget and remaining budget.
Each auction includes 5, 10, and 20 ad slots and 500 or 750 adver-
tisers bidding for impressions. Different channels have different
numbers of ad slots. In contrast, previous work only considers 5
slots and 10 advertisers bidding on a synthetic data set. We will re-
lease the desensitized data set to help researchers better understand
our method.
5.1.3 Simulation system and metrics. In our offline simulated auc-
tion system, we will traverse each traffic record block by block
according to its timestamp. Each block contains all traffic records
within fifteen minutes. For each record, we implement a strict Gen-
eralised second-price auction [ 5]. Before executing the auction, we
rigorously check that the whether the recalled ad campaign has
run out of its budget. If this ad campaign runs out of its budget, it
will be offline immediately and will not participate in subsequent
auctions.
The goal of global budget allocation is to maximize the overall
conversions of winning impressions from all the Ad campaigns.
Here we report the averaged CostPerConversion (CPC), total
Conv ersions (Conv) and platform total Revenue (Rev) in a budget
period4. Because we cannot know the real click conversion behav-
ior in the offline experiment, we will use the estimated display
revenue of all ad campaigns that have received ad impressions as
Revenue (Rev), and the sum of the conversion rates as the number
of conversions (Conv). In order to avoid the leakage of sensitive
4A budget period is generally 24 hours.data, we normalize all the metrics, i.e., set the base method to 1.00
and report the percentage change when different budget strategies
are turned on.
5.1.4 Offline results. We run extensive experiments on the real
dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Tab. 1
presents the offline benefit of revenue, conversions, and CPC by
using our method. Fig. 2 captures the impact of the coefficient of
entropy regularization 𝜖. As the results show:
CPC Reduction. The reason behind CPC reduction is that we
coordinate all advertisers to optimize their conversion, fully con-
sidering the interaction among different advertisers, where we can
effectively avoid excessive competition. Almost all advertisers can
achieve more conversions within a prefixed budget.
Revenue and Conversion Increase. In this paper, we focus
on optimizing the conversions of all advertisers while maintaining
the revenue of the platform. The overall revenue has also increased
even though we did not optimize revenue, as the budget utilization
rate of some Ad campaigns has increased. There are two kinds of
ad campaigns existing in the ad platform, the former always has
a relatively high bid and can easily run out of the budget, and the
latter’s bids are relatively low and may be in some unpopular track,
barely able to spend their budget. In the past, such Ad campaigns
with relatively low bids cannot spend their budgets as there are
unreasonable competition. With the help of global budget manage-
ment, the head campaigns (such campaigns with relatively high
bids) will give priority to more suitable traffic channels, thus giving
up some unsuitable channels. The display opportunities on such
"unsuitable" channels are obtained by the Ad campaigns in the mid-
dle and tail, improving their budget utilization rate. The increase in
conversions is caused by the overall CPC decreases and the budget
utilization rate increase.
Local Methods Cannot Work Well. When the proportion of
advertisers who use local allocation [ 9,21] in the entire Ad platform
increases, the corresponding number of overall conversions and
revenue will decrease. This is because there is excessive competition
in some channels, as too many advertisers greedily distribute their
budgets based on their local historical data preferences.
The Impact of Entropy Coefficient 𝜖.In Fig. 2, we use differ-
ent budget allocation matrix P𝑖,𝑗that are computed by different 𝜖
to conduct auction simulations. As the 𝜖gradually increases, the
total number of conversions first increases and then decreases. We
analyze that this is because as the entropy term keeps getting big-
ger, the budget allocation becomes less sparse, but the solution
(allocation strategy) also deviates more from the optimal solution.
Therefore, in our real online deployment, we will select the most
appropriate 𝜖based on the offline experiment results.
5.2 Online Setting
5.2.1 Online Budget Bucketing A/B Test. In a typical A/B test, in
order to compare control A with a treatment B, members are ran-
domly split into two groups with one group receiving the control
and the other group receiving the treatment. This approach is not
directly applicable to what we wanted to test.

bucket B but impose no budget restrictions in bucket A, bucket ACross-channel Budget Coordination for

will consume more budget than Budget B, i.e., getting a negative re-
sult. Here we introduce a simple yet effective experiment paradigm
for correctly showing the impact of budget management. Learning
from the work of other platform5, we will not only divide the whole
traffic into two parts but also divide the total budget of a campaign
into two parts. As shown in Fig. 3(b), if a traffic hits bucket A, then
it only uses the budget of bucket A without affecting that of bucket
B, which ensures that the experimental and control bucket do not
compete for the budget.
5.2.2 Online results. Here we report the real results that we collect
the traffic record from our online advertising system for 30 days.
With OT budget allocation, we can help advertisers spend their
budgets on high-quality conversion traffic while considering the
interaction among different advertisers and avoiding excess com-
petition on certain channels. To our best knowledge, we are the

6 DISCUSSION
This paper presents a cross-channel budget management frame-
work where we coordinate all competing advertisers to allocate
a limited budget to different channels in order to maximize the
overall conversion. In other words, we focus on market-making
(which is very important for the ad platform) while maintaining
or promoting platform revenue as much as possible. In the future,
we plan to present a more comprehensive theoretical analysis of
the Nash equilibrium efficiency with game theory. We also have an
interest in combining the RL-based method to enhance our frame-
work by dynamically adjusting the cost matrix. As for the limitation,
the method we propose is more suitable for advertisers who use
auto-bidding techniques like OCPX [ 23]. For those advertisers who
bid independently, they might adjust their behavior (i.e., lower their
offer or increase their offer) as a function of maximizing their own
utility. We currently only apply our method on ad campaigns with
automatic bidding, and we will work hard to be compatible with
those who might adjust their behavior in the future.
