The Schrodinger equation with a Yukawa type of potential is s olved analytically. When diﬀerent
boundary conditions are taken into account, a series of solu tions are indicated as Bessel function, the
ﬁrst kind of Hankel function and the second kind of Hankel fun ction, respectively. Subsequently,
the scattering processes of K¯K∗andD¯D∗are investigated. In the K¯K∗sector, the f1(1285)
particle is treated as a K¯K∗bound state, therefore, the coupling constant in the K¯K∗Yukawa
potential can be ﬁxed according to the binding energy of the f1(1285) particle. Consequently, a
K¯K∗resonance state is generated by solving the Schrodinger equ ation with the outgoing wave
condition, which lie at 1417 −i18MeV on the complex energy plane. It is reasonable to assume that
theK¯K∗resonance state at 1417 −i18MeV might correspond to the f1(1420) particle in the review
of Particle Data Group(PDG). In the D¯D∗sector, since the X(3872) particle is almost located at
theD¯D∗threshold, the binding energy of it equals to zero approxima tely. Therefore, the coupling
constant in the D¯D∗Yukawa potential is determined, which is related to the ﬁrst zero point of
the zero order Bessel function. Similarly to the K¯K∗case, four resonance states are produced as
solutions of the Schrodinger equation with the outgoing wav e condition. It is assumed that the
resonance states at 3885 −i1MeV, 4029 −i108 MeV, 4328 −i191MeV and 4772 −i267MeV might
be associated with the Zc(3900), the X(3940), the χc1(4274) and χc1(4685) particles, respectively.
It is noted that all solutions are isospin degenerate.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Schrodinger equation in a central force potential can be solve d with the method of separation of variables,
and the eigenenergy is only relevant to the radial part of the Schro dinger equation. In the S-wave approximation,
where the quantum number of the orbital angular momentum is zero , the centrifugal potential term disappears, and
the radial Schrodinger equation takes the same form as the one-d imensional Schrodinger equation with appropriate
function substitution.
If the wave function vanishes at the inﬁnity, the solution of the Sch rodinger equation corresponds to a bound state
of the system. This is a typical problem in the textbook of quantum m echanics. However, here we will try to study
a scattering process that the particle comes into the potential fr om the inﬁnity, or goes out of the potential directly,
which implies that the wave function will not disappear at the inﬁnity. I n this situation, complex eigenenergies of the
Hamiltonian are obtained when the Schrodinger equation is solved. Ac tually, these solutions are associated with the
complex poles of the scattering matrix, and they correspond to diﬀ erent types of resonance states, respectively[1].
Thef1(1285) and f1(1420) particles are assumed to be quark-antiquark states in a th ree-ﬂavor linear sigma model
although their masses are above 1GeV[2]. Meanwhile, the f1(1285) particle has been studied in the unitary coupled-
channel approximation by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation, an d it is asserted that the f1(1285) particle should
be aK¯K∗orK∗¯Kbound state since its mass is lower than the K¯K∗threshold[3], while the f1(1420) particle is
related to a triangle singularity of K∗¯KK[4]. However, in Ref. [5], where the longitudinal part of the vector m eson
propagator is taken into account in the intermediate loop function w hen the Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved, a peak
appears in the vicinity of 1400MeV, which is above the K¯K∗threshold, and no other peaks are detected. Therefore,
it is assumed that this peak might correspond a K¯K∗resonance state and is identiﬁed with the f1(1420) particle.
Apparently, these two articles show diﬀerent results from each ot her.

The proton-neutron resonance states have been obtained by so lving the Schrodinger equation under the outgoing
wave condition[6], where an one-pion-exchanging potential is assum ed, just as done in Re. [7]. In this work, the K¯K∗
interaction is investigated by solving the Schrodinger equation unde r the outgoing wave condition. An one-pion-
exchange potential in the K¯K∗system is assumed, which is diﬀerent from the kernel used in the unit ary coupled-
channel approximation, where a vector meson exchange potentia l is dominant according to the SU(3) hidden gauge
symmetry. Weassumethe f1(1285)particleisa K¯K∗boundstate, andthenthe K¯K∗couplingconstantisdetermined.
Sequently, a K¯K∗resonance state around 1400MeV is obtained as a solution of the Sc hrodinger equation under the
outgoing wave condition. Apparently, it’s more possible that the K¯K∗resonance state in the vicinity of 1400MeV
might correspond to the f1(1420) particle in the review of Particle Data Group. Therefore, th e relation between
theK¯K∗bound state f1(1285) and the K¯K∗resonance state f1(1420) is established. At this point, it is diﬀerent
from those calculation results by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equat ion, where only one pole of the T−amplitude is
generated dynamically on the complex energy plane.
In sequence, this method is extended to study the D¯D∗system reasonably by replacing the s−quark into the c−
quark. Ever since the X(3872) particle was discovered by Belle collaboration ﬁrstly in 2003[8], more charmonia have
been found in the facilities around the world, and more detailed iterat ions can be found in recent review articles[9–16].
On the structure of the X(3872)with JPC= 1++(also named as χc1(3872) in Ref. [17]), there are diﬀerent theoretical
interpretations, such as the conventional twisted χc1(2P) charmonium[18, 19], the compact tetraquark state[20–23],
the hybrid state[24], the D¯D∗/D∗¯Dbound state[25–33], the virtual state of D¯D∗/D∗¯D[34, 35], the mixture of c¯cand
D¯D∗/D∗¯Dbound state[36–43]. Especially, the X(3872) particle is also studied with the method of pole counting
rule, and it is concluded that two nearby poles are essential to desc ribe the experimental data[44, 45].
Inthepresentwork,the K¯K∗andD¯D∗systemsarestudiedrespectivelybysolvingSchrodingerequationa nalytically
in the one-pion exchanging potential, and some resonance states a re obtained, and more of them have a counterpart
in the review of Particle Data Group(PDG)[17].
The whole article is organized as follows. In Section II, the framewor k is evaluated in detail. the K¯K∗andD¯D∗
systems are analyzed in Sections III and IV, respectively. Finally, a summary is given in Section V.
II. THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION WITH A YUKAWA POTENTIAL
If the interaction of two particles is realized by exchanging a pion, th e potential of them can be indicated as a
Yukawa type, i.e.,
V(r) =−g2e−mr
d, (1)
wheremis the mass of the pion, gis the coupling constant, and the distance rin the denominator has been replaced
with the range of force d= 1/mapproximately. It is apparent that the potential in Eq. (1) is reaso nable in the range
of force, and it is equal to the original Yukawa potential asymptot ically at the inﬁnity. Under this approximation, the
Schrodinger equation can be solved analytically.
Supposing the radial wave function R(r) =u(r)
r, the radial Schrodinger equation with l= 0 can be written as
−/planckover2pi12
2µd2u(r)
dr2+V(r)u(r) =Eu(r), (2)
whereµis the reduced mass of the two-body system.
With the variable substitution
r→x=αe−βr,0≤x≤α, (3)
and
u(r) =J(x), (4)
the radial Schrodinger equation in Eq. (2) becomes
d2J(x)
dx2+1
xdJ(x)
dx+/bracketleftbigg2µg2
dβ2x
α1
dβ1
x2+2µE
β21
x2/bracketrightbigg
J(x) = 0. (5)
Supposing
α= 2g/radicalbig
2µd, β =1
2d, (6)3
and
ρ2=−8d2µE, E ≤0, (7)
the radial Schrodinger equation becomes the ρth order Bessel equation, i.e.,
d2J(x)
dx2+1
xdJ(x)
dx+/bracketleftbigg
1−ρ2
x2/bracketrightbigg
J(x) = 0, (8)
and its solution is the ρth order Bessel function Jρ(x).
For the bound state, when r→+∞, the radial wave function R(r)→0, which implies that u(r) =Jρ(αe−βr) =
Jρ(0) withρ≥0. On the other hand, when r→0,u(r)→0, and it means
Jρ(α) = 0. (9)
Therefore, if only one bound state of the two-body system has be en detected and the binding energy is given, the
order of the Bessel function ρin Eq. (9) can be determined according to Eq. (7), and then the cou pling constant gin
the Yukawa potential is obtained with the ﬁrst zero point of the Bes sel function Jρ(α), which takes a form of
g2=α2
8µd. (10)
The Hankel functions H(1)
ρ(x) andH(2)
ρ(x) are also two independent solutions of the Bessel equation. Actua lly,
H(1)
ρ(x)e−iωtrepresents a wave along the positive direction of the xaxis, while H(2)
ρ(x)e−iωtcorresponds to a wave
along the negative direction of the xaxis. When a scattering process of two particles is investigated, th e general
solution of Eq. (8) can be written as
u(r) =DH(1)
ρ(x)+D′H(2)
ρ(x). (11)
By requiring D′= 0, only the outgoing wave H(1)
ρ(x) is left. Similarly, with D= 0, the incoming wave H(2)
ρ(x) is
conserved.
When the coeﬃcient D′is set to zero in Eq. (11), D′= 0, the ﬁrst kind of Hankel function H(1)
ρ(x) represents a
wave coming in from r=∞. Whenr→+∞,u(r)∼H(1)
ρ(αe−βr)→H(1)
ρ(0). whenr→0,u(0)→0, which implies
H(1)
ρ(α) = 0. (12)
Actually, the incoming wave condition in Eq. (12) is equivalent to the bo und wave condition in Eq. (9) since the zero
points ofH(1)
ρ(α) are the same as those of Jρ(α) respectively when the value of ρis determined. Therefore, either by
Eq. (9) or by Eq. (12), the same value of the coupling constant gin the Yukawa potential can be obtained with the
ﬁxed binding energy.
When the coeﬃcient Dis set to zero in Eq. (11), D= 0, the second kind of Hankel function H(2)
ρ(x) represents
a wave going out from the coordinate origin r= 0. When r→+∞,u(r)∼H(2)
ρ(αe−βr)→H(2)
ρ(0). whenr→0,
u(0)→0, which implies
H(2)
ρ(α) = 0. (13)
If the ﬁrst zero point of the Bessel function Jρ(α) has been obtained according to the binding energy of the two-bod y
system, which indicates the coupling constant gin the Yukawa potential is determined, the energies of the two-bod y
resonance states can be calculated with the outgoing wave conditio n in Eq. (13). Apparently, the energy of the
resonance state is related to the order of the second kind of Hank el function, and takes a complex value E=M−iΓ
2,
where the real part represents the mass of the resonance stat e, while the imaginary part is one half of the decay width,
i.e., Γ = −2iImE, as discussed in Ref. [1].
III.K¯K∗INTERACTION
Hence we try to study the possible bound or resonance states of t heK¯K∗system by solving the Schrodinger
equation, just as done in the case of the proton-neutron system [6]. The potential of the kaon( anyikaon) and the
vector antikaon(kaon) takes the Yukawa type as that in Eq. (1), where the range of force is the reciprocal of the pion4

mass, i.e.,d=1
mwithm= 139.57MeV. Since the mass of the f1(1285) particle is 105MeV lower than the K¯K∗
threshold, it can be regarded as a K¯K∗bound state. Similarly to the case of the proton-neutron system, the order of
Bessel function in Eq. (9) can be obtained with the binding energy E= 105MeV, which takes a value of 3 .703, and
then the ﬁrst zero point of Jρ(α) is found to be α= 7.1831, as shown in Fig. 1. Supposing the f1(1285) particle is a
bound state of the K¯K∗system, the coupling constant of the K¯K∗potentialgis assumed to be relevant to the ﬁrst
zero point of Bessel function. Thus the coupling constant gin theK¯K∗potential can be determined according to
Eq. (10), i.e., g= 1.682.
In follows, with the same value of αbeing the zero point, the order of the second kind of Hankel funct ion will be
evaluated according to Eq. (13). The order of the second kind of H ankel function might be complex, which implies
that the complex eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian might correspond to a resonance state of the system. As to the K¯K∗
system, the corresponding eigenenergy is listed in Table I. Note tha t the value of K¯K∗threshold has been included
in the real part of the energy.
The resonance state appears at 1417 −i18MeV,as labeled in Fig. 2, where the function of 1 /|H(2)
ρ(α)|2is calculated
at diﬀerent complex energies. Apparently, a pole of 1 /|H(2)
ρ(α)|2corresponds to a zero point of H(2)
ρ(α). It is higher
than theK¯K∗threshold, and might correspond to the f1(1420) particle. Therefore, by solving the Schrodinger
equation with diﬀerent boundary condition of the wave function at r→0, thef1(1285) and f1(1420) particles are
generated in the S-wave approximation, which can be regarded as a bound state and a resonance state of the K¯K∗
system, respectively. In a word, it is assumed that the K¯K∗interaction is realized by exchanging a pion, which
is diﬀerent from the assertion of hidden gauge symmetry, where th e ﬂavorSU(3) symmetry of hadrons is breaking
spontaneously and a vector meson is assumed to transfer betwee n the kaon and the vector anti-kaon, such as ρ,ωor
φ[5].5

ρ(α), which represents a K¯K∗resonance state, as labeled in the ﬁgure.
IV.D¯D∗INTERACTION
In this section, we study the properties of charmonia by solving the Schrodinger equation of the Dand¯D∗mesons.
Supposing that the D¯D∗potential takes a Yukawa type, as given in Eq. (1), where m= 139.57MeV, the D¯D∗
interaction is realized by exchanging a pion. In order to determine th e coupling constant g, theX(3872) particle is
assumed to be a D¯D∗bound state. Since the mass of X(3872) particle almost lies at the D¯D∗threshold, the order of
Bessel function is zero according to Eq. (7). Therefore, the valu e of theD¯D∗coupling constant is related to the ﬁrst
zero point of Bessel function J0(α), which is 2 .405, thus the coupling constant in the D¯D∗potential can be obtained
according to Eq. (10), i.e.,
g= 0.323. (14)
Withα= 2.405 as a zero point, the order of the second kind of Hankel functio n can be obtained by solving Eq. (13),
which is a complex number, and is relevant to the energy and decay wid th of theD¯D∗resonance state. The
corresponding energies of the D¯D∗resonance states are listed in Table II, moreover, the possible PDG counterparts
are also depicted correspondingly.
Altogether there are four resonance states generated by solvin g Eq. (13), as depicted in Fig. 3, the ﬁrst one lies at
3885−i1MeV on the complex energy plane, which is higher than the D¯D∗threshold and might correspond to the
Zc(3900) particle. That is to say, if the X(3872) particle is a bound state of Dand¯D∗mesons, the Zc(3900) particle
would be a resonance state of D¯D∗. In the calculation of this work, the isospin of the state can not be d istinguished,
therefore, all states generated dynamically are isospin degenera te.
In addition to the resonance state at 3885 −i1MeV,there are other three resonance states generated dyna mically at
4029−i108MeV, 4328 −i191MeV and 4772 −i267MeV as listed in Table. II, and it’s more possible that the last two
resonance states correspond to the χc1(4274) and χc1(4685) particles, respectively. Although the mass of the state
at 4029−i108MeV is close to the ψ(4040) particle, this state owns a positive parity, while the parity of theψ(4040)
particle is negative. The D¯D∗system is investigated in the framework of the constituent quark m odel[46–49], Lattice
QCD[50] and the DD∗interaction[51, 52],respectively, and a partner state of X(3872) with JPC= 1++is predicted in6

these articles, which might correspond to the X(3940) particle listed in the PDG data[17]. In our calculation, a D¯D∗
resonance state appears at 4029 −i108MeVon the complex energy plane, which might correspond to the partner state
of theX(3872) particle mentioned in these articles. Anyway, we have given a hint to look for this possible resonance
state by the experimental collaboration in future. Consequently, it is concluded that all these four resonance states
are radial excitation states of D¯D∗in the S-wave approximation.

TABLE II: The complex energy of the possible D¯D∗(¯DD∗) resonance state with the outgoing wave condition in Eq. (13 ) and
the possible counterpart in the PDG data. All are in units of M eV.
Since theX(3872) particle almost lies at the D0¯D∗0threshold, the X(3872) particle has been treated as a D¯D∗
bound state and the binding energy is set to zero. Therefore, the zero point of the zeroth order Bessel function is
evaluated in the calculation, which is relevant to the coupling constan t in theD0¯D∗0Yukawa potential. However, the
D−D∗+andD+D∗−channels also contribute to the production of X(3872)[33], which is about 8.11MeV lower than
theD−D∗+orD+D∗−threshold[17], so the X(3872) particle can also be regarded as a D−D∗+orD+D∗−bound
state with a binding energy of 8.11MeV. Along this clue, the order of t he Bessel function in Eq. (9) takes a value of
1.796, and the ﬁrst zero point of the corresponding Bessel funct ion lies atα= 4.8583. Therefore, the D−D∗+coupling
constant in the Yukawa potential can be determined according to E q. (10), i.e., g= 0.6520, which is about twice of
theD0¯D∗0coupling constant. With the zero point of α= 4.8583, the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian can be obtained
according to Eq. (13). Consequently, two resonance states are generated as solutions of the Schrodinger equation.
which lies at 3880 −i24MeV and 3947 −i256MeV on the complex energy plane, as shown in Fig. 4. It is reasona ble
to assume the resonance state at 3880 −i24MeV correspond to the Zc(3900) particle, while the resonance state at
3947−i256MeVrepresent the X(3940) particle in the PDG data[17]. In addition, no other solutions ar e found at the
higher energy region. Although the binding energy becomes larger w hen theX(3872) particle is treated as a D−D∗+
bound state, it indicates that the decay width of the resonance st ate does not decrease inevitable with the binding
energy of the bound state increasing.7

V. SUMMARY
TheK¯K∗andD¯D∗systems are studied by solving the Schrodinger equation under diﬀe rent boundary conditions of
the wave function. By ﬁtting the binding energy of the f1(1285) particle, which is regarded as a K¯K∗or¯KK∗bound
state in this work, the coupling constant in the K¯K∗interaction is determined. Sequently, a K¯K∗resonance state is
generated as a solution of the Schrodinger equation under the out going wave condition, which might correspond to
thef1(1420) particle in the PDG data. Similarly, this method is extended to s tudy theD¯D∗interaction. Supposing
that theX(3872) is aD¯D∗bound state, several resonance states are obtained as solution s of the Schrodinger equation
when the outgoing wave condition is taken into account. Therefore , the relation between the bound state and the
corresponding resonance state is established by solving the Schro dinger equation.
Especially, it is found that the one-pion exchanging potential plays a n important role in order to produce the K¯K∗
andD¯D∗resonance states, while the interaction via a vector meson exchan ging is excluded in the calculation. The
eigenenergy of the Hamiltonian can be complex when the outgoing wav e condition is taken into account, which implies
that the inelastic scattering process is a non-Hermitian problem act ually. Thus it would be an important method to
study the properties of hadronic resonance states.
In summary, the K¯K∗andD¯D∗systems are studied by solving the Schrodinger equation with diﬀere nt boundary
conditions. It is found that the one-pion-exchange potential play s an important role in the interaction of these two
systems. By ﬁtting the coupling constant with corresponding bindin g energy of the bound state, some resonance
states are generated dynamically when the outgoing wave condition is taken into account, and most of them have a
counterpart in the PDG data. Therefore, the calculation results m anifest that there are intrinsic relations between
the bound state and resonance states of the system.
