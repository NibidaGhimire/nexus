Abstract
We consider the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) for the nonleptonic decay rates of heavy
hadrons, and compute the NLO QCD corrections to power terms up to order 1 /m2
Q. We
neglect the masses of the final-state quarks, so the application of our result is mainly for
charmed hadrons. Our result can be applied also to bottomed hadrons as they constitute the
main effect to this order up to corrections of O(mc/mb) and contributions due to penguin
operators. We discuss the impact of our result for the lifetimes of heavy hadrons.arXiv:2304.08964v2  [hep-ph]  29 Jun 20231 Introduction
With the development of the heavy quark expansion (HQE) [1–4], the theoretical description of
inclusive decay rates of heavy hadrons (i.e. of hadrons containing a single heavy quark Q) has
been advanced significantly. The HQE allows us to describe their decay rates Γ and spectra as a
systematic expansion of the form [5–9]
Γ =∞X
n=0Γn1
mQn
, (1)
where the Γ n∝Λn
QCDinvolve non-perturbative parameters, the so called HQE parameters, with
coefficients that can be computed perturbatively as a power series in αs(mQ).
Over the last decades, this method has been continuously improved and refined, in particular by
computing higher-order corrections in Λ QCD/mQas well as higher-orders in αs(mQ). For inclusive
semileptonic decays and motivated by the possibility to determine Vcbwith a high precision, the
HQE has been investigated very intensively, while for inclusive nonleptonic rates the HQE has been
pushed to a similar level.
The most inclusive quantities are the lifetimes of heavy hadrons, which can be computed in the
HQE. Its main prediction is that the leading contribution to the heavy hadron lifetime is described
by the decay rate of the corresponding free heavy quark. To this end, the HQE thus predicts that all
heavy-hadron lifetimes are equal up to corrections of order (Λ QCD/mQ)2, since the term linear in the
expansion parameter is absent due to heavy quark symmetries. In fact this was an embarrassment
in the early days of the HQE, since at that time only measurements of lifetimes of charmed hadrons
were available. The current numbers are [10]

which are in contrast to the expectation of a few percent. This clearly shows that this simple picture
is too naive in the case of charm, leaving us with some doubt on the applicability of the HQE for the
charm quark [11]. Within the HQE, the large lifetime differences are tracked by matrix elements of
four quark operators which have Wilson coefficients that are enhanced by a 16 π2phase-space factor
and scale as 16 π2(ΛQCD/mc)3relative to the leading term [12]. In the case of charm, these terms
can become comparable to the leading term. The successful applications of the HQE to charm are
all related to observables where the matrix elements of these four quark operators are suppressed
for some physical reason. The HQE for charmed hadrons have been extensively used to explore its
applicability, e.g in [13–17].
In contrast, for the bottom quark this picture seems to be more realistic, since one finds for the
bottom hadrons [10]

which is a clear motivation for considering also higher order corrections to the HQE of lifetimes,
whose current status has been presented in [18–22].
1As for the current knowledge of the perturbative QCD corrections to the coefficients of the HQE
of the rate, the situation is the following:
•Semileptonic decays : The leading power coefficient is known at N3LO [23, 24]. The co-
efficients of the first power correction are known at NLO [25–27]. From the second power
correction onwards four-quark operators start to appear. For the second power correction the
coefficients of the two-quark and four-quark operators are known at NLO [28–31]. Finally,
the coefficients of the third and fourth power corrections are known at LO [32, 33] for the
two-quark operators.
•Nonleptonic decays : The leading power coefficient is known at NLO [34–37] and at NNLO
in the massless case for the color-singlet ∆ B= 1 operator [38]. The coefficients of the first
power correction are known at LO [6,39,40]. The coefficients of the second power correction are
known at LO for the two-quark operators [41–43] and at NLO for the four-quark operators [44,
45]. Finally, the coefficients of the third power correction are known at LO for the four-quark
operators [46].
In the present paper we extend the existing calculations for nonleptonic widths by computing
αscorrections to power suppressed terms at next-to-leading power. We present an analytical result
for the nonleptonic width at order αs(mQ)(ΛQCD/mQ)2for the case of vanishing final state quark
masses.
The main application of our result is Dhadron decays as it corresponds to the Cabibbo-
Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) favoured decay channel c→s¯du. To some extent, our results can
be applied to Bhadron decays. To order αs(mQ)(ΛQCD/mQ)2they constitute the main effect in
the CKM favoured decay channel b→c¯udup to corrections of O(mc/mb). The same is true for
the CKM favoured decay channel b→c¯csup to corrections of O(mc/mb) and up to the effect of
penguin operators, which is not considered in this paper.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss the effective electroweak Lagrangian
and the choice of the renormalization scheme. In section 3 we set the definitions for the HQE. In
section 4 we describe our method for the computation. Finally, we collect the results and discuss
their impact in section 5.
2 The effective electroweak Lagrangian
In this section we discuss the effective Lagrangian describing nonleptonic transitions and provide
the main definitions needed for this paper. At low momentum transfer compared to the W-boson
mass MW, the nonleptonic heavy quark decay Q→q1¯q2q3can be described by an effective Fermi
Lagrangian

q1Q(C1O1+C2O2) + h.c , (4)
where GFis the Fermi constant, Vqq′are the corresponding matrix elements of the CKM matrix and
C1,2are matching coefficients. We start from the standard operator basis O1,2with color singlet
2and color rearranged operators [47]
O1= ( ¯QiΓµqj

O2= ( ¯QiΓµqi

where Γ µ=γµ(1−γ5)/2 =γµPL, (i, j) are color indices, and q1,2,3are the final state quarks which
we take to be massless in the following. We assume for simplicity that the three final-state quarks
have different flavors, so we do not need to consider QCD penguin operators.
However, for the calculation we address in this paper, it is convenient to chose a different operator
basis for our effective Lagrangian in Eq. (4)

withO±= (O2± O 1)/2 and C±=C2±C1. The advantage is that this basis is diagonal under
renormalization. In the MS renormalization scheme

Nc∓1
. (8)
where the subindex Bstands for bare quantities and those without subscript stand for renormalized
ones, Nc= 3 is the number of colors and γ±is the LO anomalous dimension of the operators O±.
An important technical issue here is to retain the same scheme for the calculation of correlators
and for the calculation of the short distance Wilson coefficients C±appearing in the effective La-
grangian. The point is that the renormalization of the operators O±is additionally complicated by
the fact that they involve left-handed fields and require the special treatment of γ5in dimensional
regularization. There are several possibilities like dimensional reduction [34], the ’t Hooft-Veltman
scheme [35], or Naive Dimensional Regularization (NDR) with anticommuting γ5[36].
We decide to closely follow the approach used by [36] and chose to work in NDR within the
scheme of evanescent operators that preserves Fierz symmetry [47–53]. Such evanescent operators
are defined in ref. [47], where the two-loop anomalous dimension required for the running of C±
at NLO is also computed. This definition respects the Fierz transformation which in general is
valid only in four-dimensional space-time. This choice is very handy as it allows, by using an
appropriate Fierz transformation, to avoid closed fermionic loops, which are known to lead to
algebraic inconsistencies when using anticommuting γ5inDdimensions.
The freedom in the choice of evanescent operators is connected to the freedom in the choice of
the renormalization scheme. Such a freedom is represented by the shift

proportional to the LO anomalous dimensions γ±of the operators O±.
In the following we give the definition for the coefficients C±in NDR within the scheme of
evanescent operators that preserves Fierz symmetry. The Wilson coefficients C±with NLO precision
(including also the renormalization group improvement at NLO) are given by [34,36,47]

3which have been calculated at the scale µ=MWand then evolved down to scales µ≪MWby solving
the corresponding renormalization group equations. The equation above splits the coefficients into
a scheme-independent part proportional to R±and a scheme dependent part proportional to B±,

where nfis the number of light flavours and B= 11 in NDR with anticommuting γ5[47]. The

of order α2

equal to the corresponding matrix elements calculated with the full standard model Lagrangian.
Eventually, the scheme-dependence absorbed in B±has to cancel against the scheme-dependence

3 HQE for nonleptonic decays of heavy flavors
This section briefly describes the theoretical framework used for the calculation of inclusive nonlep-
tonic decays of heavy hadrons within the HQE and provides the main definitions. We follow the
approach introduced in [26,27,30].
By using the optical theorem one obtains the inclusive decay rate Γ from taking an absorptive
part of the forward matrix element of the leading order transition operator T
T=iZ
d4x T{Leff(x)Leff(0)}, Γ(HQ→X) =1
MHQIm⟨HQ|T |HQ⟩, (13)
where MHQis the heavy hadron mass and |HQ⟩its quantum state. Since the heavy quark mass
mQis a large scale compared to the QCD hadronization scale Λ QCD(mQ≫ΛQCD), the forward
matrix element contains perturbatively calculable contributions. These can be separated from
the non-perturbative pieces using the method of effective field theory. For a heavy hadron with
momentum pHQand mass MHQ, a large part of the heavy-quark momentum pQoriginates from a
pure kinematical contribution due to its large mass. We split the heavy-quark momentum according
topQ=mQv+ ∆ with v=pHQ/MHQbeing the velocity of the heavy hadron. The residual
momentum ∆ ∼ O(ΛQCD) describes the soft-scale fluctuations of the heavy quark field near its
mass shell.
This decomposition of the quark momentum is implemented by re-defining the heavy quark field
according to
Q(x) =e−imQv·xQv(x), (14)
so that i∂Q v(x)∼∆.
4We set up the HQE as an expansion in Λ QCD/mQby matching the transition operator Tin
QCD to an expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass, using operators defined in Heavy
Quark Effective Theory (HQET) [54–57].
Generally, the HQE for heavy hadron weak decays takes the form

C0,CµπandCµGcan be computed as a power series in αs(µ) and depend, in case of neglecting
the final-state quark masses, on logarithms of µ/m Q, where µis the matching scale. Therefore, for
µ=mQthe coefficients are pure numbers. The parameters µ2

where again the coefficients C0,Cv,CπandCGcan be computed as a power series in αs(µ). The
local operators Oiin the equation above are ordered by their mass dimensionality and are given
by∗

where πµ=iDµ=i∂µ+gsAa
µTais the covariant derivative of QCD and πµ=vµ(vπ) +πµ
⊥.
Note that the field hvdenotes the static quark field moving with the velocity vas defined in
HQET. Furthermore, it is convenient to trade the leading term operator O0in Eq. (16) by the local
QCD operator ¯Q/vQ, since its forward hadronic matrix element is normalized to unity. Expanding
¯Q/vQup to the desired order in 1 /mQwe get

will be of higher order in the HQE after using equations of motion of HQET.

In order to obtain the total rate, we have to take the forward matrix element of Eq. (16). For this
we use the full QCD states |HQ(pHQ)⟩, where HQis the 0−ground state meson with a single heavy
quark Q. This introduces a dependence of the HQE parameters on the quark mass mQthrough the
states which is nevertheless irrelevant to the order we are working on. The HQE parameters are
defined as [58]

4 Outline of the calculation
The first step is to insert the effective Lagrangian Eq. (7) into the optical theorem Eq. (13) to
perform the operator product expansion and obtain the total rate in the form of Eq. (15). In terms
of the coefficients obtained from the matching calculation Eqs. (16) and (21), in combination with
the EOM Eq. (22), we get

where we have defined ¯Ci≡Ci−C0˜Cias the difference between the coefficients of the HQE of the
transition operator and the current multiplied by C0.
The computation of the coefficients follows our previous work [30,31] where we take the corre-
sponding Feynman amplitude, expand to the necessary order in the small momentum k, and project
to the corresponding HQET operators Eqs. (17), (18) and (20).
The Feynman diagrams contributing to the leading power coefficient C0at LO-QCD and NLO-
QCD are two-loop and three-loop quark to quark self-energy-like diagrams. The ones contributing
to the coefficients of power corrections ¯Cvand ¯CGat LO-QCD and NLO-QCD are two-loop and
three-loop quark to quark-gluon scattering diagrams.
The Feynman diagrams contributing to the coefficients C0,¯Cvand ¯CGof the HQE of the
nonleptonic decay rate up to NLO are shown in Fig. [1]. For the computation of the leading
power coefficient C0only diagrams (a-p) without gluon insertions have to be considered. For
the computation of the next-to-leading power coefficient ¯CGand the auxiliary coefficient ¯Cvall

after taking into account all possible one-gluon insertions. Four-fermion vertices correspond to O±
insertions of Leff.
diagrams (a-t) containing one-gluon insertions have to be considered. Overall there are 14 diagrams
contributing to C0up to NLO, 1 to LO and 13 to NLO. There are 128 diagrams contributing to ¯Cv
and ¯CGup to NLO, 7 to LO and 121 to NLO.
By using LiteRed [59, 60] the corresponding amplitudes are reduced to a combination of the
master integrals given in appendix A. The LO diagram Fig. 1-(a) can be reduced to the two-
loop master integral Fig. 4-(a). The diagrams Fig. 1-(a,e,j-n) can be reduced to a combination of
the massless three-loop master integrals Fig. 4-(b,c). Finally, the diagrams Fig. 1-(b-d,f-i) can be
reduced to a combination of the massive three-loop master integrals Fig. 4-(d,e).
7We use standard dimensional regularization in D= 4−2ϵspace-time dimensions with γ5treated
in NDR. This forces us to chose a renormalization scheme with evanescent operators preserving
Fierz symmetry to the necessary order. In this way, we can use Fierz symmetry to write all
Feynman diagrams as a single open fermionic line without γ5problem. Nevertheless, the explicit
expressions for the coefficient functions of the HQE in terms of C±are scheme-dependent. This
scheme dependence cancels with the corresponding scheme dependence of the coefficients C±.
For the algebraic manipulations including Lorentz and Dirac algebra we use Tracer [61]. For the
color algebra we use ColorMath [62]. Expansion of Hypergeometric functions is done with the help
of HypExp [63, 64]. The computation is performed in Feynman gauge and we use the background
field method to compute the scattering in the external gluonic field.
For renormalization we adopt the MS renormalization scheme for the strong coupling constant
αs(µ) and the renormalization of the HQET Lagrangian. The heavy quark is renormalized on-shell

Therefore, we will quote our results in the on-shell (pole mass) scheme for the heavy quark mass mQ.
For most precise predictions one usually chooses for the bottom quark a low-scale short distance
mass such as the kinetic or the 1 Smass, and thus one needs to convert the on-shell mass into such
a mass scheme for which the known one-loop expression will be sufficient.
5 Results and discussion
In this section we provide the results for the coefficients of the HQE of the nonleptonic decay rate
in Eq. (15) up to NLO-QCD. Note that the reparametrization invariance of the HQE ensures that
to all orders in αs(µ) we have C0=Cµπ, so Eq. (15) takes the form

where in the second equalities we have replaced Nc= 3.
Note that the coefficient functions multiplying the C±coefficients are in general dependent on
the scheme used for γ5and the choice of evanescent operators. This scheme dependence cancels
with the scheme dependence of the coefficients C±. Therefore, the results written above together
with the definitions given in Eqs. (10), (11) and (12) are scheme-independent. In addition we note
that only two structures ( C2
++C2
−) and ( C2
+−C2
−) appear. In the basis of Eq. (4) this is translated
into the two structures ( C2
1+C2
2) and C1C2. This is implied by Fierz symmetry.
The result obtained for the C0coefficient agrees with [36] which also was obtained in NDR and
using Fierz symmetry. This result also agrees with [34] and [35], where this coefficient has been
computed in dimensional reduction and the ’t Hooft-Veltman scheme, respectively.
For the power suppressed terms, we re-calculated the expression obtained for the CµGcoefficient,
and our result agrees with the result known from [6, 39, 40]. The new result of this calculation is
the next-to-leading order contribution to the CµGcoefficient.
We may also switch to a reparametrization invariant basis as discussed in [58], where the HQE
parameters are defined using the operators of full QCD as in Eq. (14)

The NLO contributions to the coefficients are expected to reduce the dependence of the coef-
ficients on the renormalization scale µ, so we look at the µdependence of C0andCµG. In Fig.[2]
we show this dependence, varying µin the range mQ/2< µ < 2mQfor both, the bottom- and the
charm-quark cases. For illustration we take mb= 4.7 GeV, mc= 1.6 GeV, MZ= 91.18 GeV and
αs(MZ) = 0 .118, from which we obtain αs(MW) = 0 .120 at MW= 80.4 GeV. For the running of
the strong coupling αs(µ) we use RunDec [65] to run it down from MWtombwith nf= 5, and
from mbtomcwith nf= 4. The two-loop running coupling is used.
9As one would expect, the coefficients at NLO show a much weaker µ-dependence than their LO
counterparts. This is important phenomenologically since it will allow to reduce the uncertainty
due to the choice of the scale µ. This is specially true for the CµGcoefficient, where the uncertainty
due to the choice of µis very large.

As a consequence of the strong µ-dependence of CµG, NLO corrections to the CµGcoefficient are
expected to be very large in general and should also strongly dependent on the value of µ. The sum
of LO and NLO contributions is, however, almost independent of µ. Therefore, NLO corrections
happen to be very important and they stabilize the numerical value of the coefficient.
Note that for the bottom case, the leading-order chromomagnetic operator coefficient has a zero
for a value of µ≈3.8 GeV, leading to a large uncertainty for this particular contribution. However,
including the NLO contribution improves the situation significantly, leaving us with a negative
contribution, lowering the total value of the width (increase the size of the lifetimes).
Finally we illustrate the impact of the new contribution to the nonleptonic width by looking at
10the quantity
δΓNL
µG,NLO(µ)
ΓNL(µ), (39)
as a function of µin the range mQ/2< µ < 2mQ. In Fig.[3] we show its µdependence, inserting
µ2
G= 0.35 GeV2andµ2
π= 0.5 GeV2.
Based on this, we estimate a correction due to the new contribution to the nonleptonic width,
and correspondingly to the lifetimes. We find a decrease of the rate of roughly ( −5±5)% for the
charm case, while the effect for the bottom case seems to be much smaller, roughly ( −0.5±0.5)%.
However, the bottom case has to be taken with a grain of salt, since we did not take into account
theO(mc/mb) effects.

6 Conclusions
In this paper we have computed αscorrections to the chromomagnetic operator coefficient in the
HQE of the nonleptonic decay rate. This calculation represents the first attempt to include QCD
corrections to power suppressed terms in nonleptonic decays. We present an analytical result for the
nonleptonic width to order αs(mQ)(ΛQCD/mQ)2for the case of vanishing final state quark masses.
The main application of our result is for charm-hadron decays since our considerations correspond
to the CKM favoured decay channel c→s¯du. To some extent, our results can be applied to B
hadron decays. They constitute the main effect to order αs(mQ)(ΛQCD/mQ)2in the CKM favoured
decay channel b→c¯udup to corrections of O(mc/mb). The same is true for the CKM favoured
decay channel b→c¯csup to corrections of O(mc/mb) and up to the effect of penguin operators,
which are not considered in this paper.
Our main result is that the inclusion of the NLO terms significantly reduces the dependence on
the renormalization scale µ. While at leading order one finds a strong dependence, including the
NLO terms turns out to have almost no µdependence for the relevant range of µ. This stabilizes
the numerical predictions significantly.
11While our result can be directly applied to the case of the charm quark, where we can safely
neglect the light quark masses, the case of the bottom quark is more involved, since the charm-
quark mass cannot be neglected and the coefficients will depend on mc/mb. It is known from the
semileptonic case that the effects of the charm mass can be large. This will be subject of future
investigations.
Finally we point out that the methods used here can be extended to the next power in 1 /mQ,
i.e. to a calculation of the NLO contribution to the Darwin operator coefficient, at least for the
charm case where the final state quarks can be treated as massless.

of the HQE [66]. These master integrals are two- and three-loop 1 →1 topologies with on shell

After using IBP reduction four master integrals appear. Two of them are the completely massless
master integrals represented in Fig. [4]-(b,c) and the other two contain one massive line of mass mQ
and they are represented in Fig. [4]-(d,e). Fig. [4]-(b,e) are five propagator topologies with zero and
one massive lines, respectively. Fig. [4]-(c) is a massless three-loop sunset topology and Fig. [4]-(d)
is a two-loop sunset topology with a massive tadpole of mass mQ. The explicit expressions for the
master integrals to the necessary order in the ϵexpansion are

B The EOM operator coefficient
The coefficient ¯Cvappears in the matching calculation of the transition operator. The corresponding
operator is redundant, and it can be removed by using the EOM. However, its coefficient is required
in the calculation as it shifts the coefficients of higher order operators. Therefore, presenting its
explicit NLO expression might be useful. We split the result as follows

Note that the color structure is the same that appears in the leading power coefficient. The reason
is that one can compute ¯Cvby running a small momentum through the diagrams that contribute
toC0, instead of considering diagrams with one-gluon insertions.
