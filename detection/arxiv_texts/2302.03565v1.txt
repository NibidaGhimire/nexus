Abstract : First discovered by Ernest Abbe in 1873, the resolution limit of a far -field microscope 
is considered determined by the numerical aperture and wavelength of light , approxima tely 𝜆
2𝑁𝐴. 
With the advent of modern fluorescence microscopy and nanoscopy methods over the last 
century , it is recognized that Abbe's resolution definition alone could not solely characterize the 
resolving power of the microscope system . To determine the practical resolution of a 
fluorescence microscope , photon noise remains one essential factor yet to be incorporated  in a 
statistics -based theoretical framework . Techniques such as confocal allow trading photon noise 
in gaining its resolution limit, whic h may increase or worsen the resolvability towards 
fluorescently tagged targets. Proposed as  a theoretical measure of fluorescence microscopes'  
resolving power with finite photons, we quantify the resolvability of periodic structures in 
fluorescence microscopy  systems considering both the diffraction limit  and photon statistics . 
Using the Cramer -Rao Lower Bound of a parametric target , the resulting precision lower  bound  
establishes a practical measure of the theoretical resolving power for various modern  
fluore scence microscopy methods in the presence of  noise.  
One-Sentence Summary:  The resolving power  of a far-field fluorescence mi croscope is 
determined by its diffraction limit  only when infinite photons are considered . To determine  the 
resolvability of a specimen, photon noise , however,  remains one essential factor yet to be 
considered  statistical ly. We proposed an information -based  resolution measure quantifying the  
2 
 theoretical  resolving power  of a fluorescence microscope  in the condition of  finite photons . The 
developed approach  allow s us to quantify the practical resolution  limit  of varieties of 
fluorescence and super -resolution  microscopy modalities , and further for microscop y 
development s, may be used to predict the achievable resolution  of a microscopy design  at 
various photon levels .

 Introduction   
In 1873 , Abbe published his work stating that microscop y resolution solely depend s on the 
numerical aperture and wavelength of the light  (1, 2), a statement later verified theoretically  (3, 
4). This limit is often sufficient for traditional microscopes where transmission , reflect ion, or 
scattered  light is collected as signal s (5), for which the signal -to-noise ratio can be increased by 
adjusting the illumination power . However, for fluorescence microscope s, photons —the sole 
source of molecular information generated by individual fluorescent probes —are limited due to 
the photobleaching and photochemical enviro nment of the fluorophores  (6, 7). 
Due to the discrete nature of light, the photon counting noise is inherent following Poisson 
distribution , where the signal -to-noise  ratio will decrease with a decreasing number of detected 
photons . As a result, at low  photon levels , it would be difficult to determine whether the captured 
intensity differences are from underlying structure  or noise  fluctuations, thus preventing 
microscopy methods from achieving their theoretical resolution limit  (8–12). 
In search of a practical resolution, researchers  have attempted to create a measure  based on the 
channel capacity  in Shannon’s information theorem  (13), where noise can be included  (14–17). 
The general concept is that the channel capacity of the microscope system  indicates its resolving 
power  and can be calculated from the noise level and the systems’  configurations . While these 
works provide the theoretical  relationship between  the channel capacity of the microscope  and 
signal -to-noise (SNR) ratio , numerical aperture , etc., achieving high resolution  requires specific  
information  encoding -decoding scheme . Moreover , the noise is assumed  to be (frequency ) band 
limited , which photon noise does not satisfy.  
Another approach to quantify noise effect on the resolution  is by evaluating the  noisy images  
directly  (8, 9). For instance, b y quantifying the contrast between two closely spaced point 
object s, Stelzer (8) discussed the noise influence on practical resolution in confocal and wide -
field systems, which represents one of the first demonstrations of the critical difference between 
practical resolvability in the presence of noise and Abbe’s resolution limit. However,  these 
empirical methods rely on existing microscopy data and well-controlled specimens . To date, a  
theoretical resolution measure  incorporating  photon statistics  remains  missing .  
4 
 Here, we propose a quantitative and theoretical measure of the resolving power of microscopes 
considering  numerical aperture, emission wavelength, and photon s tatistics . Specifically , we 
consider the grating’s  phase  estimation precision as a measure of the resolvin g power of the 
imaging system . Based on an adjustable criterion of the achievable precision lower bound, we 
define d the information -based resolution (IbR) and used it in evaluating and distinguish ing the 
significant resolving power difference s among various  conventional and super -resolution  
imaging modalities  including wide -field microscopy , confocal microscopy (18, 19), structure d 
illumination microscopy (SIM) (20, 21), and image scan ning microscopy (ISM) (22–24). We 
expect IbR to be a useful measure  in estimat ing the noise -considered resolution to guide and 
validate the design of newly  developed or proposed imaging modalit ies.

Results  
Model

 Inspired by Abbe’s experiment al approach  based on the visibility of the gratings under 
microscope s (1), we examine the achievable phase estimation uncertainty of theoretical 2D 
sinusoidal patterns under microscope s through Fisher information  (25, 26). 
Consider a 2D grating object expressed as  
𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝑥,𝑦)=𝑈𝑎𝑣𝑒[1+𝛼sin(2𝜋𝑘𝑙𝑥 +𝜙)].    (1) 
Here (𝑥,𝑦) are pixel index in two dimension s, 𝑈𝑎𝑣𝑒 is the average photon count per pixel, 𝑙 is the 
pixel length, 𝛼 is the relative amplitude, 𝑘 is the spatial frequency  of the grating  along the x -axis, 
and 𝜙 is the initial phase of the grating  at 𝑥=0.  
The definition of Fisher information  is: 
𝐼(𝜃)=E[(𝜕𝐿(𝜃)
𝜕𝜃)(𝜕𝐿(𝜃)
𝜕𝜃)𝑇
],     (2) 
where 𝜃=[𝛼,𝑘,𝜙]𝑇  are the parameters to be estimated and  𝐿(𝜃) is the log -likelihood function 
of 𝜃. E[∙] is taking an expectation over all possible outcome s (possible noisy images) . Assuming 
detected photons from the above object through a particular  microscope  system  follow  Poisson 
distribution due to photon counting noise, we calculate the Fisher information as (27, 28) 
 𝐼(𝜃)=∑1
𝑢𝑖(𝜕𝑢𝑖
𝜕𝜃)(𝜕𝑢𝑖
𝜕𝜃)𝑇
𝑖 ,     (3) 
where 𝒖=[𝑢1,…,𝑢𝑖,…,𝑢𝑁] represents data obtained from 𝑜𝑏𝑗 through different imaging 
modalities and 𝑢𝑖 represents the expected photons of individual pixels. For wide -field and 
confocal  systems ,  𝒖 would be the ideal image ( Methods ). For conventional SIM, 𝒖 represents 9 
frames of ideal images with different structure d illumination patterns ( Methods ). For ISM, 𝒖 
would be images of emission patterns at different scanning positions ( Methods ). 
Variance l ower bound on the phase estimation, as well as frequency and relative amplitude,  can 
be calculated through Cramér –Rao lower bound (CRLB ) (26, 27) as the inverse of  the Fisher 
information matrix  𝐼(𝜃),  
6 
 𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝜃̂)≥𝐶𝑅𝐿𝐵 (𝜃)=𝐼−1(𝜃).    (3) 
The inequality indicate s the difference between two matrices  is positive semidefinite .  
As Fisher information 𝐼(𝜃) is additive, the same object imaged in a larger  field of view (FOV) 
would result in larger Fisher information  (smaller CRLB) , assuming photon flux per area is 
constant ( Fig. S1 ). Therefore, we limit our investigation throughout t he work to a FOV of 10 
μm×10 μm. To further  simplify this problem , we use the square root of CRLB of phase -𝜎𝜙, the 
phase estimation precision limit  as a scalar measure  indicating the m icroscope’s resolving power  
(higher 𝜎𝜙 means worse resolving power).   
To define  a resolution  limit , one need s a criterion of  ‘resolved .’ For example, Rayleigh ’s 
criterion , 0.61𝜆
𝑁𝐴, is defined as the distance of two points where their point spread f unction (PSF)  
first minima reach each other ’s center  (29). Sparrow  et al., defines two points resolvable when 
the mid -point of their joint intensity profile shows a minimum  (30). In search of a noise -
considered resolution criterion , we examined the visualization of noisy image s of wide  range  
frequencies, photon  densities , and phase estimation precision limits 𝜎𝜙 (Fig. S2 ). Through  visual 
comparison, we decided to set the threshold of phase estimation uncertainty 𝜎𝜙 at 0.04 rad as the 
resolving criterion.  Subsequently, IbR is defined as the reciprocal of the highest frequency the 
imaging modality could resolve  given the above criterion  (colored dashed line in Fig. 2a ).  
We want  to note that the definition of IbR  and 𝜎𝜙 criteri on is for the ease of interpretation , while 
other criteria such as  𝜎𝛼, 𝜎𝑘, or Fisher information per area can also be formed . Using Fisher 
information per area as resolving power measure will forgo the need to a fixed FOV when 
defining a resolution criterion  (Fig. S3 ). Howe ver, in cont rast to 𝜎𝜙-which can be stated as  the 
best achievable uncertainty of phase, Fisher information does not have a direct physical meaning . 
Moreover, the correlation between all three parameters would not be considered if using Fisher 
information  scalar term . As for  other parameters —relative amplitude 𝛼 and frequency 𝑘, we 
consider the  phase 𝜙 has a closer relationship to resolution. Besides, all three parameters share a 
similar trend in our simulation ( Fig. S4 ).

 Achievable resolving power in the presence of noise  
In IbR, photons are the information currency for resolving power.  In extreme cases, when no 
photons are detected, i mage s would  not be formed, leaving  no information (infinite 𝜎𝜙) for all 
imaging modalities. In contrast, when photons are unlimited (noise negligible) , IbR of various 
imaging modalities would reach  their conventional (Abbe) resolution  limit s (Fig. 2a, 2 c). With a 
limited photon (defined as the number of photons emitted per area, hereafter referred to as 
photon density), imaging modalities can no longer achieve their traditional limit due to Poisson 
noise.  Instead , their practical resolving power differ s drastically , and their differences also 
depend on the complexity of the imaging target  (e.g., spatial frequency of the target) . Using the 
developed approach , we investigate  wide -field microscopy , confocal  microscopy , SIM , and ISM , 
four commonly  used imaging modalities , quantifying their resolving power in the presence of 
noise towards objects of frequencies  ranging from 0 to 4𝑁𝐴
𝜆. 
The general trend of resolving power of the wide -field system , confocal  system , SIM , and ISM 
targeting objects of different frequencies  is demonstrated in Fig . 2a. At low frequencies, well 
within the diffraction limit, ISM achieves significantly superior resolving power surpassing all 
other modalities , whereas the wide -field system and SIM perform  similarly . For example, w ithin 
a low-frequency  range ([0,𝑁𝐴
𝜆]), ISM has phase estimation precision limit  𝜎𝜙 up to 1.5 times  
lower than  that of  the wide -field system  and SIM  (Fig. 2a ). This can be explained by ISM’s 
effective usage of small area pixel detectors which extends its OTF while the multi -pixel based 
PSF detection ensured no photon loss . In comparison,  the confocal  system  has the worst 
resolving power at low frequencies among all m odalities quantified  due to photon loss by 
pinhole rejection . At frequency 0.2𝑁𝐴
𝜆, a confocal system  has a 1.5 times higher (worse)  phase 
estimation precision limit  𝜎𝜙 value than that of a wide -field system  (Fig. 2a ).  
At high er frequencies, while the wide -field system reach es diffraction  limit  at frequency  2𝑁𝐴
λ 
resulting in an infinite 𝜎𝜙,  the confocal  system , SIM and ISM demonstrate capacity overcoming 
the diffraction limit  of the wide -field system  (Fig. 2a ). SIM showed the highest reso lving power 
given a limited photon level.  For a photon density of 5000  photons /μm2 (Fig. 2a ), SIM achieves 
an IbR of 170 nm, surpassing the conventional diffraction limit resolution 250  nm while ISM,  
9 
 confocal and wide -field systems achieved IbR of 220 nm , 270 nm  and 315 nm, respectively 
(color dashed line in Fig. 2a ). Such superiority results from the  SIM-enabled shift of  object’s 
frequency component  from outside the OTF boundary  to the center of OTF  which enhance its 
transfer magnitude (Fig. S7, S8). 
The above results can also be demonstrated from the view  of photon requirement.  To achieve a 
specific practical resolution (IbR), imaging modalities would require different minimum  
number s of photons ( Fig. 2c ). To resolve an object with a frequency as low as 0.2𝑁𝐴
𝜆 , a confocal 
system requires 90 photons/ μm2. In comparison, others require less than 40 photons/ μm2, a more 
than 2 -fold difference. To resolve an object of frequency 𝑁𝐴
𝜆, ISM require s 150 phot ons/μm2 
while other modalities require at least 380 photons/ μm2 emitted from the specimen. At a higher  
frequency 1.85𝑁𝐴
λ (slight ly below the diffraction limit),  a wide -field system requires 1 25,000 
photons/ μm2. A confocal system requires 5580 photons/μm2, roughly 20 times less than a wide -
field system , while ISM and SIM require 2 orders fewer photons at 1147 photons / μm2 and 600 
photons/ μm2. To resolve an object of  significantly higher frequency  3.5𝑁𝐴
𝜆, SIM requires the least 
amount of photo n density  of 24,800 photons/ μm2 compared  to 4,607,000 photons/ μm2 
requirement for ISM, more than 2 orders of magnitude difference. In contrast, even with one 
billion photons/ μm2, a confocal system can’t resolve  such a structure , although the structure is 
theoretically resolvable by the confocal  system  based on its optical transfer function  (19, 31).  
The phase estimation precision limit  𝜎𝜙 has an inverse square root relationship with photon 
counts ( Fig. 2 d). This is because as each incoming photon is considered as an event in Fisher 
information calculation, the Fisher information matrix (inverse of CRLB) is linearly proportional 
to photon counts  in the absence of background fluorescence.   
In microscopy ima ging, the background is the unwanted  photon  signal which increas es noise  
(12). To quantify background influence on resolving power, w e separate the target  object  and the 
assumed uniform b ackground  by reformulat ing Eq. 1 as 𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝑥)=𝑈𝑎𝑣𝑒′[1+sin(2𝜋𝑘𝑙𝑥 +𝜙)]+
𝑏𝑔. Here 𝑈𝑎𝑣𝑒′ is the photon density  emitted by the target structure . 𝑏𝑔 is the photon density  from 
the background . At low frequencies, ISM is better tolerant of background photon s while others 
perform similarly . Given a signal level 𝑈𝑎𝑣𝑒′ 1000 photons/ μm2, to resolve an object of relative ly  
10 
 low frequency as 0.95𝑁𝐴
𝜆, wide -field system , confocal system , and SIM can tolerate background 
up to 500 0 photons/ μm2, while ISM could tolerate  background up to 12 ,000 photons/ μm2. At 
high frequencies, SIM and ISM are supe rior to the others . To resolve an object of relative ly high 
frequency as 1.85𝑁𝐴
𝜆, a frequency close to the diffraction limit,  SIM can tolerate  background of up 
to 800 photons/ μm2 while ISM could only resolve the structure when the background is  close to  
zero. On the other hand, given the limited photon level , the wide -field system and the confocal 
system cannot resolve the structure even in a background -free environment ( Fig. S5).

 NA and emission wavelength influence on resolving power  
While in Abbe’s resolution limit (𝜆
2𝑁𝐴), numerical aperture  (NA)  and emission wavelengths share 
an equally important role . Their influence on IbR  (noise considered resolution ), however,  differ s. 
In addition to the effect on OTF , increasing NA also increase s the photon collection angle , thus 
making NA a more critical  factor than the wavelength  in IbR . For an object of frequency 
1
0.4 𝜇𝑚−1, quantified through  𝜎𝜙 in ISM, the precision limit  improved 5.96 times when 
increasing NA from 0.6 to 0.8 , whereas an equivalent change in detection wavelength from 0.8 
to 0.6 μm only improves it by 2.45 times ( Fig. 3 a, 3b ).  
Given a specific  photon densit y, IbR also enables us to  calculate the minimum requirement of 
NA and emission wavelength for various imaging modalities to resolve a n object . As an 
example, we examine a grating object  with a frequency of 1
0.4 𝜇𝑚−1 (peak to peak  interval of the 
grating object is 0.4 μm) with photon density 50 00 photons/ μm2 as an instance . When the 
emission wavelength is fixed as 700  nm, it is theoretically resolvable with NA greater than 0.9 in 
a wide -field system without noise . However, when considering noise , a wide -field system  
require s an NA of 1.15  and thus requir es an  oil/water  immersion objective . In contrast, c onfocal  
system , ISM , and SIM have much relaxed  requirement  with a minimum NA of 0.95, 0.75, and 
0.65, respectively  (Fig. 3 a). When the NA of the microscope is fixed  (e.g., 0.8 in air), wide -field 
system , confoca l system , ISM , and SIM require  emission wavelength s smaller or equal to 480 
nm, 530  nm, 720  nm, and 900  nm to resolve the structure (Fig. 3b ).

immer sion medium refractive index as 1.5 and emission wavelength as 0.7 μm. Camera pixel size in the wide -field 
system and scanning intervals in the confocal systems are set to 0.1  μm. 
 
Pinhole size influence on confocal  system  
In confocal imaging, shrinking  pinhole  size affects the resolving power in two opposite ways —
improving it by broadening effective OTF while worsening it by decreasing photon detection due 
to photon rejections  of the pinhole  (19, 24) (Supplement Note , Fig. S6). When the pinhole 
radius  is too large ( e.g., 2 Airy disk unit s (AU)), the confocal  system ’s performance  would be 
close to that of a wide -field system  (Fig. 4a ) (6,7). As the pinhole radius shrink s, the confocal   
13 
 system  tends to have better resolving power . For instance, confocal  system s with pinhole radi i of 
1 AU  (𝐴𝑈=1.22𝜆
𝑁𝐴)  and 0.5 AU result  in IbR of 300 nm and 270 nm compared to that of the 
wide -field system at  315 nm (Fig. 4a ). However, when pinhole size shrinks even smaller, the 
resolving power of confocal  system  decay rapidly due to photon rejection of pinhole . For 
example, a confocal system with a pinhole radius  of 0.1 AU results in an  IbR of 500 nm. The 
tradeoff  between improvement and deterioration of the confocal system’s resolving power , often 
balanc ed by pinhole size from experience , can now be quantified through phase estimation 
precision  limit 𝜎𝜙 to find the optimal pinhole radius. We found o ver a large range frequency, 0.5 
AU radius of pinhole size reaches  the lowest 𝜎𝜙 in general , suggesting  that it is a proper setting 
for confocal  system s in most cases which is in agreement with the common practice  in confocal  
system s (24). To seek an optimal  resolv ing power for an object at specific frequenc ies, Fig. 4b 
demonstrates  the optimal pinhole radius to achiev e the lowest 𝜎𝜙 given four grating objects of 
different frequencies.  For objects of frequency 0.5𝑁𝐴
𝜆, 𝑁𝐴
𝜆, 1.5𝑁𝐴
𝜆 and 2𝑁𝐴
𝜆, the optimal pinhole 
radius is 1.2, 0.9, 0.6, 0.5 AU, respectively . Generally, a small pinhole radius suits object s of 
high frequenc ies, while a large pinhole radius suits object s of low frequenc ies.

 Pixel size influence on the wide -field microscope  
The pixel size of the digital image detector , often  considered irrelevant to the conventional 
resolution limit , however,  has an impact on IbR. Generally, while ignoring the camera readout  
noise  (instrument noise) , a smaller pixel size provides greater resolving power ( better  IbR). We 
show this trend even  when pixel size gets smaller than that required by  the Nyquist sampling 
theore m (32, 33). Taking wide -field microscopy as an example , the phase estimation precision 
limit  𝜎𝜙 increase s twice from 0.05  rad to 0.1 rad while changing  pixel size  from  0.2 μm (Nyquist 
sampling pixel size ) to 0.28 μm, indicating the importance of using  pixel size smaller than 
Nyquist sampling requirement   (Fig. 5 ). In addition, we investigated  IbR in  situation s of 
applying a pixel size  even smaller than that required by Nyquist sampling . We found that f urther 
reducing pixel size to 0.1 μm would decrease 𝜎𝜙 by roughly 30% compared to a Nyquist 
sampling pixel size  of 0.2 μm, approaching its limit of 0.029 rad when using infinite small pixel 
size ( approximated as  0.01 μm). The above results indicate that binning pixels as equivalent to 
using larger pixel sizes in a microscope will reduce the effective resolving power of the imaging 
system  when instrument noise is negligible . This is understood as  each pixel being  a photon 
bucket that integrates all photons  falling in to its active area, the pixelization process function as  a 
low pass filter  (34) (Supplement Note ).

𝜆  are shown on the

immersion medium refractive index as 1.5, and emission wavelength as 0.7 μm. The c amera pixel size in S IM is set 
to 0.1 μm. 
Influence of the s tructure d illumination frequency on SIM  
In aberration -free systems, it is a common intuition that complex objects (objects with high-
frequency  components) are harder to resolve. In terms of IbR , imaging modalities generally 
achieve  greater resolving power (lower 𝜎𝜙) at lower frequencies than that at higher frequencies  
(Fig. 2a) . However, there are exception s while  using  SIM in some frequency range s that a higher 
frequency structure is better resolved than a lower frequency  one. Taking SIM with  an 
illumination frequency 𝑘𝑠𝑡=2𝑁𝐴
𝜆 as an example  (blue curve in Fig. 6 ), phase estimation 
precision limit 𝜎𝜙 at frequency 2𝑁𝐴
𝜆 is smaller  (0.013  rad) than that at frequency 1.5𝑁𝐴
𝜆 (0.016 rad, 
Fig. 6 ). Since  the emission from structure d illuminated object  contains information from both its 
original and shifted spatial frequenc ies, with increasing the object’s  frequency, the transfer 
amplitude of its origin al frequency would decrease as it approaches the boundary of OTF. 
Meanwhile, the transfer amplitude of its shifted frequency would increase as it approaches the 
center of OTF  (Fig. S7, S8). As both original and shifted frequency contribute s to the phase 
estimation, the opposite trend of their  resulting transfer amplitudes causes variation s in the 
relationship between phase estimation precision limit 𝜎𝜙 and object’s frequency 𝑘. 
As the frequency composition of a structure d illuminated obje ct is influenced by its structure d 
illumination frequency -𝑘𝑠𝑡, we ask how SIM of different structure d illumination would influence 
its resolving power. We tested SIM with four illumination frequencies. The general trend 
suggest s a higher  illumination fr equency -𝑘𝑠𝑡 provides lower phase estimation precision 𝜎𝜙 
(better resolving power) over the most  range of object’s frequencies ( Fig. 6 ). This  agrees that the 
common ly used illumination frequency in SIM is at the OTF boundary (20, 21). However, in 
some  cases , a lower illumination frequency could improve the  resolving power compar ed to that 
of a higher  frequenc y, contradicting th is comm on practice. For example, while imaging an object 
of frequency 1.5𝑁𝐴
𝜆,  𝜎𝜙 of SIM is worse when using an illumination frequency of  𝑘𝑠𝑡=2𝑁𝐴
𝜆, a  
16 
 frequency at the OTF boundary, than that of a lower illumination frequency ( e.g., 𝑘𝑠𝑡=1.4𝑁𝐴
𝜆, 
Fig. 6a). Above results indicate that in theory using higher structure d illumination frequency in 
SIM is generally beneficial  but not always . 
In conventional SIM,  the structure d illumination pattern is a 1 D sinusoidal  wave pattern that only 
shifts the object’s frequency along one direction. The common practice is to apply a set of three 
patterns , each having 60-degree s orientation  difference , to cover the 2 D frequency plane, which 
causes an uneven resolution distribution along different direction s (20, 21).  Quantifying through 
our phase estimation precision limit 𝜎𝜙, we measured  this orientation -dependent resolution in 
Fig. S9 . In the condition of  photon density  5000 photons/μm2, 30 degree s difference in the initial 
orientations of structured illumination pattern s set could alter IbR of SIM  from 150 nm  to 192 
nm along one direction . Increas ing the number of  illumination pattern orientation s in a set could  
alleviate the uneven distribution . In the above conditions, w e tested that applying a set of six 
illumination patterns  instead of three  in SIM achieve d an IbR of 170 nm  for all initial 
orientations  (Fig. S9 ).  
Discussion  
The purp ose of IbR is to create a noise -considered resolution limit predicting the performance of 
imaging modalities  with finite photon count s. The concept of IbR relies on  the ideal image 
formation of a periodic  object . In our calculation , we assumed the  fluorescence  respon se is 
linear, meaning the emission  intensity is proportional to the illumination power. Thus, o ur IbR 
cannot be directly applied to some of the super -resolution imaging modalities , such as single -
molecule localization microscopy (SMLM)  (35–38) and stimulated emission depletion (STED) 
microscopy  (39, 40), which rel y on nonlinea r fluorescence  response . For example, SMLM 
requires the ‘blinking’ of individual emitters. Howe ver, the emitter s switch  stochastic ally, and 
thus,  the resolution limit of SMLM relies on the exact on -off time sequence s of imaged single 
molecules , which is challenging to summarize for IbR. The resolution  of STED  depends on the 
power of the depletion laser  and its PSF . In an ideal situation  where the depletion PSF has a 
perfect donut shape  and infinite power, the resolution of STED can reach the molecule’s size  
(40). IbR could potentially provid e a method for assessing its practical resolution when  provided 
the properties of the non-linear behavior of the probe and its  physical model during  depletion.  In  
17 
 addition, ano ther limitation of IbR is that it only quantifies the lateral resolution in a 2D sample 
at the current stage. Without considering the actual 3D environment in the sample, IbR cannot 
measure the ability to resist  out-of-focus background, for which the confo cal system  is designed.   
Fisher information allowed us to consider photon noise  in our resolution measure , and the phase 
estimation precision limit 𝜎𝜙 can be understood as the uncertainty of lateral positioning of the 
grating pattern. Although CRLB does not guarantee any estimators approaching it, it is often 
considered the best achievable precision of a parameter . This is because the variance of an 
unbiased maximum likelihood estimat or (MLE ) asymptotically approach es CRLB  (26).  
In modern microsco py methods , the raw data are often post -processed  to form the image for 
visualization. A question naturally arises as to whether data post-process ing could increase the 
information and, therefore  resolution  (e.g., IbR). To this end, o ur theoretical derivation  
(Supplement Note ) shows  that no Fisher information could be increased through deterministic 
data post -processing method s. Therefore, post -processing  method s including image 
reconstruction  algorithms , could either  keep  IbR constant or  worsen IbR.  
IbR provide s a new measure  of quantifying the practical  resolving power of microscop y imaging 
modalit ies considering finite photons . The noise -consider ed resolution  measure  could  provide a 
theoretical  and statistical  reference for fluorescence microscope imaging modalities in photon -
limited conditions  and also serve as a guide for the further development of novel microscopy 
methods .

 Methods  
2D periodic structure  generation  and microscope imaging system simulation  
We simulate a 2D single -tone sinusoidal  wave grating object by Eq. 1  in a 20 μm×20 μm region , 
which contains 4000×4000 pixels  (5 nm per pixel) . Throughout the simulation  except for when 
background level is specifically examined , the relative amplitude 𝛼 is set to 0.95  (95% signal, 
5% background) , and the initial phase 𝜙 is set to 0. The ideal image is simulated as projected on  
the object plane , so the magnification is unitary . We simulate the ideal image formation process 
based on Fresnel approximation (4) without optical aberrations . This process can be viewed as 
object convolution with PSF  (4). To generate PSF, we first create a pupil function of circular  
shape with radius  𝑁𝐴
𝜆 in the Fourier space. In Fourier space, each pixel denotes frequency interval  
1
𝐿 where 𝐿=20 𝜇𝑚 is the length of the image.  The radius of the p upil function in terms of the 
number of pixels is 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 (𝑁𝐴
𝜆∗𝐿), where 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑  function make 𝑁𝐴
𝜆∗𝐿 an integer. PSF is the 
magnitude square of the Fourier transform of the pupil function . The ideal image simulation 
conditions for each figure are listed in the figure caption, including  the numerical aperture of the 
objective, refractive index of the immersion media, fluorescence emission wavelength , and 
expected photon density.  
Wide -field m icroscopy simulation  
In wide -field microscopy simulation, we directly convolve the object with the PSF to obtain the 
ideal image. After convolution, to avoid the simulation error at the boundary , we crop the central 
region 10 μm×10 μm from  the ideal image  to form the FOV . The cropped image  is subsequently 
binned to 100 pixels ×100 pixels to mimic the pixel integration effect of  camera detection , except 
for Fig. 5 , where pixel size in the wide -field system  is specifically examined . In the 100 pixels 
×100 pixels image, t he camera pixel size is 0.1  μm.  The binned  image representing  𝒖 in Eq. 1 , is 
used to further calculate the Fisher information matrix . 
Confocal microscopy simulation   
19 
 In confocal  system  simulation, we assume the excitation  laser focus is diffraction limited , 
sharing  the same numerical aperture with the  emission detection . Although the emission 
wavelength is typically larger than the excitation wavelength due to Stokes shift of the 
fluore scence emission , for simplicity of mathematical calculation, we assume d the excitation 
shares the same wavelength  as emission. This assumption allows us to waive one additional 
parameter, simplifying the simulation model. As a result, the excitation PSF is  identical to the 
emission PSF  throughout our simulation . At the image plane, we simulate a circular pinhole  in 
the conjugate pla ne with the center of the excitation PSF . The radius of the pinhole we simulated 
in each figure are listed in the figure captions.  The image recording sensor is simulated as  a 
bucket photon detector which integrates  the photons collected for each scanning  position. For 
each position, we dot product the object with the excitation PSF to generate the excited object  
fluorescence distribution . Subsequently, we convolve this excited object with PSF to form the 
image before the pinhole. We dot product the image with the pinhole mask (1 within the pinhole 
radius, 0 otherwise), sum the result , and assign it to the scannin g position. Throughout the 
simulation, we set the total number of scanning positions to 100×100 covering  the central  10 
μm×10 μm region with a scanning interval  of 0.1 μ m. The image recorded with 100*100 
scanning points  representing 𝒖 in Eq. 1  is used to further calculate the Fisher information matrix.  
Image scanning microscopy simulation  
ISM simulation follows the same steps as the confocal system simulation except using an array 
detector instead of a bucket detector with a physical pinhole . We record the image at each 
scanning position with a camera of 10 pixels ×10 pixels with a pixel size of 0.2 μ m, whereas the 
maximum pixel size according to Nyquist sampling is 0.25 μm. We set the total number of 
scanning positions  to be  100×100 covering  the central  10 μm×10 μm region with a scanning 
interval of 0.1 μ m. Therefore, in total , 104 frames of images of different scanning positions 
formed the data 𝒖 in Eq. 1 , which is used to further calculate Fisher information.  
Structured illumination microscopy simulation  
In SIM, to form the ideal image, we first applied the structured illumination pattern on the object 
to form a structur ally-illuminated object.  Throughout the work, we used the structure d  
20 
 illumination pattern of a single -tone sinusoidal wave. The oscillation range of the structure d 
illumination intensity is from 0 to 2 , such that applying the pattern to the object would not affect 
the total number of photons the object emits.  The frequencie s of the structure d illumination 
pattern simulated in each figure are listed in the figure captions. We convolve the structur ally-
illuminated  object with PSF to form the ideal image. Like wide -field microscopy, we crop the 
central region 10 μm×10 μm of the  ideal  image , and t hen the cropped image is binned to 100 
pixels ×100 pixels to mimic the actual camera detection , where the  camera pixel size is 0.1  μm. 
In total , we collect images with three  structure d illumination  orientations  of 60o difference , and 
each orientation contain s three  patterns with a phase s difference of 2𝜋
3. A total of nine image 
frame s with different structure illumination orientation s and phases are collected  as data 𝒖 in Eq. 
1, which is used to further calculate Fisher information.  
Fisher information calculation  
When a random variable ( in this case: pixel value) follows Poisson distribution, the Fisher 
information can be  calculated by Eq. 3, which requires the derivative of 𝒖 with respect to 𝜽=
[𝛼,𝑘,𝜙]. We calculate it numerically  by the difference of the 𝒖 function  with a small increment 
and decrement  on the specific parameter . For example, we calculate 𝜕𝑢𝑖
𝜕𝛼=
𝑢𝑖(𝛼+∆𝛼,𝑘,𝜙)−𝑢𝑖(𝛼−∆𝛼,𝑘,𝜙)
2∆𝛼 where  we set  ∆𝛼 equal  to 0.01 in our simulation  where 𝛼 is the 
modulation amplitude  (𝛼∈[0,1]) of the periodic object . Respectively, we use ∆𝜙=0.01 and 
∆𝑘=1
𝐿 where 𝐿=20 𝜇𝑚 is the total length of the image , which are both smaller than 2% of our 
typical simulations’ range . By arranging ∆𝑘 this way , we will ensure  that in the frequency 
domain, the Fourier transform of a single -tone sinusoidal pattern provides isolated frequen cy 
peak s in single pixel s.

Note  1: Data post -processing influence on Fisher information  
Supposing we have 2 random variables which are 𝐽 and 𝐾 denoting raw data and processed 
data. 𝐾 is determined by 𝐽 by function 𝐾=𝐻(𝐽) where  𝐻 is a deterministic function. Consider 
the chain rul e of Fisher information (41) 
𝐼𝐽,𝐾(𝜃)=𝐼𝐽(𝜃)+𝐼𝐾|𝐽(𝜃). 
The conditional Fisher information is  
𝐼𝐾|𝐽(𝜃)=𝐸𝑗[𝐼𝐾|𝐽=𝑗(𝜃)]. 
By Fisher information definition we have  
𝐼𝐾|𝐽=𝑗(𝜃)=𝐸𝑘[(∂log(𝑝(𝐾|𝐽=𝑗;𝜃))
𝜕𝜃)2
], 
where 𝑝(𝐾|𝐽=𝑗;𝜃) is the conditional probability density function. Since 𝐾=𝐻(𝐽) is 
determined  as 
𝑝(𝐾|𝐽=𝑗;𝜃)={1     𝐾=𝐻(𝑗)
0   𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒, 
above equation indicates the conditional probability density function is determined on condition 
but irrelevant to any pa rameter 𝜃. Thus, the partial derivative is zero resulting in  
𝐼𝐾|𝐽=𝑗(𝜃)=0,∀𝑗, 
𝐼𝐾|𝐽(𝜃)=𝐸𝑗[𝐼𝐾|𝐽=𝑗(𝜃)]=0. 
Comb ining first equation we have  
𝐼𝐽(𝜃)=𝐼𝐽,𝐾(𝜃)=𝐼𝐾(𝜃)+𝐼𝐽|𝐾(𝜃)≥𝐼𝐾(𝜃). 
Last step of inequality comes from fact that any Fisher informat ion is greater or equal to 0  
(26). If the processing is deterministic, then Fisher information in the processed data 𝐾 would 
always be smaller or equal to raw data 𝐽. In another word, deterministic image post -processing 
cannot increase Fisher information  of any parameter. Note that this statement is under condition 
that image processing is deterministic. If other prior information could be accessed, this 
relationship would not stand.  
 
Note  2: Pixel binning effect  
Pixel binning effect is stated in work ( 33). However, to the best knowledge of the author, I 
did not find a clear derivation on the pixel binning effect. We derive this effect as follows.

 Supposing we have a 2D image with coordinate (𝑥,𝑦), the image is recorded with discrete 
pixel index [𝑛,𝑚]. The function of each individual pixel is to integrate all photons falls within 
the pixel

Here (𝑥𝑛,𝑦𝑚) is the coordinate which is  at the center of pixel [𝑛,𝑚] and 𝑑 is the pixel size. 
𝐼𝑚𝑔 (𝑥,𝑦) is photon distribution function.  𝐼𝑚𝑔 [𝑛,𝑚] is the image value at each pixel. We create 
a function defined as  
𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)=1

From expression, function 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦) is function  𝐼𝑚𝑔 (𝑥,𝑦) frequency filtered by two sinc 
functions. The image pixels’ value 𝐼𝑚𝑔 [𝑛,𝑚] is the sampling on function 𝑓(𝑥𝑛,𝑦𝑚). Pixel size 
𝑑 not only affects the sampling process but also affects the frequency filter applied on the image.

Diagram of  a confocal microscope.  
The OTF derivation of confocal can be found in works ( 19,24 ). For completeness and 
reference, we provide our version of derivation below.  
The fluorescence distribution on the object plane is  
𝐼𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝜉,𝜂)=𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝜉,𝜂)∙𝑃𝑆𝐹 𝑒𝑥(𝜉−𝜉0,𝜂−𝜂0)∙𝜅, 
where 𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝜉,𝜂) is the fluorophore density distribution, 𝑃𝑆𝐹 𝑒𝑥(𝜉,𝜂) is the excitation PSF, 
(𝜉0,𝜂0) denotes the scanning position and 𝜅 is the excitation to emission coefficient we assumed 
to be 1 for simplicity.  We also assumed the magnification is 1 for simplicity.  
Forming the ideal image before pinhole we have  
𝐼1(𝑥,𝑦)=∬ 𝑃𝑆𝐹 (𝑥−𝜉,𝑦−𝜂)𝐼𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝜉,𝜂)𝑑𝜉𝑑𝜂+∞
−∞. 
The ideal image after pinhole would be  
𝐼2(𝑥,𝑦)=𝐼1(𝑥,𝑦)∙𝐼𝑝ℎ(𝑥−𝑥0,𝑦−𝑦0), 
where 𝐼𝑝ℎ(𝑥,𝑦) is the pinhole function  either zero or one , (𝑥0,𝑦0) is the conjugate position of 
scanning position on the image plane. Since magnification is 1, the conjugate relationship would 
be (𝑥0,𝑦0)=(−𝜉0,−𝜂0).  
In confocal imaging, a bucket photon detector would collect all photons for each scanning 
position and for m a value. Therefore, the ideal image value of confocal at (𝑥0,𝑦0) would be  
𝐼𝑖𝑚𝑔(𝑥0,𝑦0)=∬ 𝐼2(𝑥,𝑦)𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦+∞
−∞  
=∬ 𝐼1(𝑥,𝑦)∙𝐼𝑝ℎ(𝑥−𝑥0,𝑦−𝑦0)𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦+∞

−∞. 
Exchange  the integration order we have  
=∬ [∬ 𝑃𝑆𝐹 (𝑥−𝜉,𝑦−𝜂)𝐼𝑝ℎ(𝑥−𝑥0,𝑦−𝑦0)𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦+∞
−∞]∙𝐼𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝜉,𝜂)+∞

If we assume the pinhole function is symmetric, we have

Let 𝑥′=𝑥−𝜉 and 𝑦′=𝑦−𝜂, the equation becomes

−∞]∙𝐼𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝜉,𝜂)+∞
−∞𝑑𝜉𝑑𝜂 . 
The integration in the bracket above  is considered as a convolution between 𝑃𝑆𝐹 and 𝐼𝑝ℎ 
taking the value at (𝑥0+𝜉,𝑦0+𝜂), then the equation becomes  
=∬ (𝑃𝑆𝐹 ⨂𝐼𝑝ℎ)(𝑥0+𝜉,𝑦0+𝜂)∙𝐼𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝜉,𝜂)+∞

Consider the conjugate relationship (𝑥0,𝑦0)=(−𝜉0,−𝜂0) and we have  
=∬ (𝑃𝑆𝐹 ⨂𝐼𝑝ℎ)(𝜉−𝜉0,𝜂−𝜂0)∙𝐼𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝜉,𝜂)+∞
−∞𝑑𝜉𝑑𝜂 . 
Expand the fluorescence distribution expression  we ha ve 
=∬ (𝑃𝑆𝐹 ⨂𝐼𝑝ℎ)(𝜉−𝜉0,𝜂−𝜂0)∙𝑃𝑆𝐹 𝑒𝑥(𝜉−𝜉0,𝜂−𝜂0)∙𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝜉,𝜂)+∞

=∬ (𝑃𝑆𝐹 ⨂𝐼𝑝ℎ∙𝑃𝑆𝐹 𝑒𝑥)(𝜉−𝜉0,𝜂−𝜂0)∙𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝜉,𝜂)+∞
−∞𝑑𝜉𝑑𝜂 . 
If we consider 𝑃𝑆𝐹 and 𝑃𝑆𝐹 𝑒𝑥 are also symmetric,  the equation becomes  
=∬ (𝑃𝑆𝐹 ⨂𝐼𝑝ℎ∙𝑃𝑆𝐹 𝑒𝑥)(𝜉0−𝜉,𝜂0−𝜂)∙𝑜𝑏𝑗(𝜉,𝜂)+∞

Writing in this expression allows us to identify the ideal image formation in confocal as 
object convolution with an effective PSF where  
𝑃𝑆𝐹𝑒𝑓𝑓=𝑃𝑆𝐹 ⨂𝐼𝑝ℎ∙𝑃𝑆𝐹 𝑒𝑥. 
The corresponding effective OTF w ould be Fourier transform on the PSF expression  
𝑂𝑇𝐹𝑒𝑓𝑓=𝑂𝑇𝐹 ∙𝐹𝑇{𝐼𝑝ℎ}⨂𝐹𝑇{𝑃𝑆𝐹 𝑒𝑥}. 
Figures of effective OTF of confocal  with different pinhole radii  are plotted in Fig. S 6.
