ABSTRACT
Intensity interferometry is a re-emerging interferometry tool that alleviates some of the challenges of amplitude interferometry
at the cost of reduced sensitivity. We demonstrate the feasibility of intensity interferometry with fast single photon counting
detectors at small telescopes by utilising a telescope of diameter of merely 0.5 m. The entire measurement setup, including
collimation, optical filtering, and two single photon detectors, is attached directly to the telescope without the use of optical
fibres, facilitated by the large area of our single photon detectors. For digitisation and timing, we utilise a Time-To-Amplitude-
Converter.Observing 𝛼Lyrae(Vega)foratotalexposuretimeof 32.4 hoverthecourseofsixnights,anauto-correlationsignal

1 INTRODUCTION
For image formation, direct astronomical imaging as well as ampli-
tude interferometry utilising arrays of telescopes need to preserve
phase coherence throughout the optical setup (Monnier 2003). This
condition can be kept in both cases even at turbulent atmospheric
conditions employing adaptive optics and appropriate delay lines,
yet at the cost of considerable technological complexity and strain.
Nonetheless, amplitude interferometry has been fruitfully imple-
mented at interferometers like VLTI and CHARA with baselines
up to 127 m(Haubois & Mieske 2021) and 331 m(ten Brummelaar
et al. 2005), respectively.
Intensity interferometry, on the other hand, correlating light in-
tensities rather than amplitudes, offers a way to avoid some of the
technical challenges of amplitude interferometry. Intensity interfer-
ometry’s relative simplicity in principle facilitates baselines much
larger than the ones of current amplitude interferometers, up to a
fewkilometres(seee.g.,Dravinsetal.(2013)).Intensitycorrelation
measurements of starlight were first carried out with telescopes by
Hanbury Brown & Twiss (1956), determining the diameter of Sir-
ius toa thenunprecedented precision.Expanding on previouswork,

In recent years, interest in intensity interferometry for astronomy
hasresurgedduetoadvancesinphotondetectiontechnology.Forthe
first time since the decommissioning of the Narrabri Stellar Inten-
sityInterferometer,temporal(Guerinetal.2017)andspatial(Guerin
et al. 2018)) intensity correlations of light from three bright stars
were measured at the C2PU facility on the Plateau de Calern site of
ObservatoiredelaCôted’Azur.Atthesameobservatorythedistance
toPCygniandRigolwasestimatedbycombiningintensityinterfer-
ometryandspectroscopy(Rivetetal.2020;deAlmeidaetal.2022).
Further temporal and spatial intensity correlations were carried out
since 2017, at telescopes and with arrays varying widely in size and
geometry. utilising two telescopes of diameter 1.8 mand1.2 m, re-
spectively,andmountingtheAQUEYE+andIQUEYEinstruments,
Zampieri et al. (2021) measured spatial and temporal intensity cor-
relations in the light of 𝛼Lyrae (Vega), at zero baseline and with
a fixed baseline of over 1 km. Correlating light from up to three
0.6 mDobsonian telescopes, Horch et al. (2021) performed spatial
intensity correlation measurements for five bright stars. While all
experiments mentioned so far employ conventional optical imaging
telescopes, Acciari et al. (2019) measured intensity correlations for
three bright stars using the two telescopes of the MAGIC array, be-
longing to the class of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescops
(IACTs).PerformingintensityinterferometrywithanarrayofIACTs
has been intensively studied in the past and is seen as a promising
route for constructing very sensitive modern intensity interferome-

ters (Dravins et al. 2013). In a first step towards this goal, all four
telescopes of the VERITAS array were used to accurately measure
stellardiameterswithintensityinterferometryforthefirsttimesince
the Narrabri Intensity Interferometer by Abeysekara et al. (2020).
Other than the results described by Horch et al. (2021), all in-
tensity interferometry experiments referenced so far have been per-
formed at larger-scale astronomical facilities. Modern single photon
counting equipment however allows for intensity interferometry at
smaller, commercially available telescopes, reducing the cost of an
intensity interferometer greatly. We report on successful temporal
intensitycorrelationmeasurementsofVegaintheBbandtakenwith
a commercially available 0.5 mdiameter telescope. In this paper we
summarise briefly the theory of intensity correlations in section 2.

2 SECOND ORDER INTENSITY CORRELATIONS
The second order correlation function

accounts for the loss of coherence due to averaging over 𝑁spatial,
spectroscopic, or polarization modes, and 𝑔(1)(𝜏)denotes the first
order correlation function, sometimes called the complex degree of
coherence. The second part of eq. (1), relating first and second or-
der correlation functions and thus field and intensity correlations, is
called the Siegert relation and holds only for thermal light sources
(TLS), e.g. for stars (Siegert 1943). The first order correlation func-
tionisrelatedtothenormalizedspectrum 𝑠(𝜔)ofthesourceviathe
Wiener-Khintchine theorem (Mandel & Wolf 1995):
𝑔(1)(𝜏)=∫∞

For a TLS, the second order correlation function displays a peak
with𝑔(2)(𝜏=0)>1,centeredaroundzerotimedelay,droppingtoa

tionpeakisproportionaltothesourcecoherencetime 𝜏𝑐.Withinthe
coherence time, a TLS thus displays bunching, meaning it is more
likely to detect two photons arriving at the detector coincidentally
rather than separated by times 𝜏 >0. While in the field of quantum
optics, one would conventionally define the coherence time 𝜏𝑐as
the inverse spectral bandwidth, we choose a definition related to the
correlation peak integral:

3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
3.1 Telescope and optical setup
For our experiment, we used a commercially available 0.5 mdiam-
eter Corrected Dall-Kirkham telescope (Planewave CDK 20). The
telescope is located at the Dr. Karl Remeis-Observatory of the As-
tronomicalInstituteoftheUniversityofErlangen-Nürnberg,located
in the city of Bamberg at latitude 49 °53’04.4" North and longitude
10°53’17.3" East. The telescope has a primary mirror diameter of
508 mm, a secondary mirror obstruction of 15.2%of the primary
mirror aperture, and a focal ratio of 𝑓/6.8. We mounted an inte-
grated rotating focuser directly to the telescope providing a travel
range of 30 mm. This rotating focuser allows for the direct attach-
ment of a 9 kgload. The telescope mirror efficiencies are specified
bythemanufacturerto96percent,whereasnodatafortheefficiency

a secondary refractive telescope attached to the telescope tubus.
The optical setup attached to the telescope is sketched in fig. 1.

In general terms, a TAC acquisition system offers more degrees
of freedom to the user than a standard TDC correlation system,
e.g., the bin-width can be tuned. To obtain sufficient counts per bin
for correlation experiments with TLS, we chose the TAC readout
parameters to yield a bin size Δ𝜏bin=12.2 ps, while employing the
highestpossiblereadoutnoisesuppression.Toaccuratelymeasurethe
timing resolution of the complete Becker&Hickl setup, we however
changed these parameters to yield a bin size Δ𝜏bin=1.1 ps. Since
the TAC detection system lacks channel symmetry and introduces
systematics near the TAC range edges, we induce a channel delay
between the CFD and the SYNC channel. This channel delay was
implemented by a difference in cable length of 3 mbetween both
detectors,whichtogetherwithinternalTACdelaysandopticalsetup
delays yields a total channel delay of 34.5 ns.

The measurement result shown in fig. 5 is obtained after an

electronics was kept on to accurately characterize the entire system
performance during the course of the night. In later evaluations, the

6 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have presented results of temporal intensity in-
terferometry with light from Vega using a commercially available
PlanewaveCDK20telescope.Therequiredopticalcomponentsand
single photon counting hybrid detectors were all attached directly
to the telescope focuser exit. After six nights of measurement, a
bunching peak with an amplitude of 9.5×10−3,a coherence time
of(0.34±0.12)psand a SNR of 2.8was obtained. To our knowl-
edge, this measurement constitutes the first time that single photon
countingdetectorswereusedforintensityinterferometryintheblue,
and the first time that bunching was measured at a telescope of
a diameter of merely 0.5 m. Our results agree well with both the

full setup to 5.5%. We thus implemented a cost-effective, but sen-
sitive, intensity interferometry experiment using a 0.5 mdiameter
telescope.

per time interval is proportional to the count rate squared (Brown
et al. 1957), and the detected rate is proportional to the area of the
telescope, whose diameter we doubled. If, as suggested in Trippe

wavelength multiplexed Dobsonians would serve as a cost-effective
wayofimplementinganintensityinterferometer.Firststepsintothis
direction have already been taken by Horch et al. (2021).
Mirrors even larger in diameter are currently already in use for
intensityinterferometryexperimentsatIACTs.Duetothehighfluxes
obtained at these large telescopes, these experiments currently rely
on correlating the photo-current of photomultiplier tubes. Recently,
prototypes single photon counting detectors with up to GHzburst
rates,largeareas,lowtimingjitter,andhighquantumefficiencieshave
beenrealisedbyOrlovetal.(2019).Theuseofsuchdetectorscould
be especially beneficial at telescopes like MAGIC or the Cherenkov
Telescope Array’s Large Size Telescopes, which have an intrinsic
telescope timing jitter on the order of 100 ps(Shayduk et al. 2005).
