Abstract —We aims to provide an interpretation of the the
design background, motivation, and key innovations of FreeRider
[1]. The technique utilized by FreeRider enables tags to transform
codewords present in commodity signals into another valid ones
from the same codebook during reﬂection. As a result, the
backscattered signal remains valid as commodity radios such
as ZigBee or Bluetooth. By using commodity radios, FreeRider’s
backscatter system addresses the issue of specialized hardware
requirements, thereby expanding its potential applications across
various ﬁelds such as smart homes, healthcare, and industrial
environments.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Backscatter communication is a wireless link that allows
Internet-of-Things devices to connect while consuming ultra-
low power. Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) is a simple
yet effective technology used by businesses, governments, and
individuals alike for various purposes such as inventory man-
agement, tracking assets, monitoring production processes,
and security applications [2]–[4]. At its core, RFID consists
of two key components: a reader and a tag. Tags contain
a unique identiﬁer or code that is transmitted wirelessly to
the reader when the tag comes within range. The reader then
captures this signal and decodes the information stored in the
tag. Compared to active transmissions, passive RFID requires
no internal power source and only consumes microwatts of
power during data transmission because they use the received
electromagnetic waves to recharge, then send messages or
modify stored data.
As an extension to RFID, the backscatter system consists
of a separate excitation signal generator and receiver shown
in Fig. 1. Backscatter communication enables battery-free
sensors to transmit data using existing commodity radios for
they passively reﬂect and modify wireless signals without
any decoding and codeword translation operations to embed
information. The advantage of commodity radio backscatter
technology over RFID is that it reduces the complexity and
cost of deploying battery-free sensors as data from their tags
can be read using existing commodity infrastructures rather
than requiring specialized exciters and readers. Therefore,
the potential for wider deployment of this technology exists
as it leverages existing infrastructure, reducing costs and
complexity.In order to avoid reader exclusivity, FreeRider [1] has
designed and implemented a backscatter system that can
communicate using commodity signals that are not fully
dedicated to backscatter devices. In other words, tags don’t
need to generate excitation signal while transmitters (gateway
or terminal) can directly use the radio communicating with a
non-backscattering device as the excitation signal for backscat-
tering.
In the following section, we will look in detail at why
FreeRider chose its technical solution, starting with the tech-
nical background. Based on its solution, we perform a brief
veriﬁcation test of the decoding on the receiving end. We will
also describe what practical values FreeRider achieves and
what their future challenges are.

II. D ESIGN BACKGROUNDS AND GOALS
While designing a new backscatter system that works on
commodity radios, there are aspects to be considered on all
three components: the excitation signal generator, the tag and
the receiver.
A. As Exciter
There have been previous attempts to move away from
the speciﬁcity of RFID (or backscatter) readers. Passive WiFi
[9] tags achieve communication by absorbing and reﬂecting
existing WiFi signals, which makes passive WiFi tags ideal
for battery-free IoT devices. Though passive WiFi shows thearXiv:2305.10316v1  [cs.DC]  17 May 2023compatibility with existing wireless networks, the transmit-
ters have to provide the necessary empty radio strength for
communication to take place. This is a feature not available
on commodity WiFi access points or terminals as the 802.11
protocol stack performs whitening operations when sending
data.
It has been shown that the performance of IoT devices is
already generally affected by ISM band congestion [7]. Due to
the limitations of the communication principle in some low-
power implementations of backscattering technology, the tags
send data at a lower rate on the carrier waves than its normally
encoded data. This implies light amounts of data from the
detector, which also generates a relatively heavy channel load.
Regardless of whether it is a backscatter device or not, we
don’t expect new technologies to continue to increase the
congestion in the ISM band.
The disadvantage of traditional backscatter technology (such
as RFID) is that it is limited by distance and requires a
dedicated RF signal. It requires the reader to generate and
send an RF signal, then it is expected that the label would
receive, obtain energy from induced currents, and reﬂect the
radio wave back to the reader. The wireless radio fades during
the send-and-turn process. As a result, there is a loss both
in the path and at the tag, and the effective communication
distance is only several meters [5], [6]. However, without
considering the design of the tag internals, it is not necessary
for the transmitter to play the role of the receiver [8].
One key advantage of RFID technology is its ability to track
and manage large numbers of items quickly and accurately. It
enables businesses to automate their inventory processes and
track the location of items in real-time, reducing manual errors
and labor costs. In addition, RFID also provides enhanced
security measures by accurately identifying and tracking the
movement of items, preventing theft and unauthorized access.
We hope that the new backscatter system technology will
retain this key advantage.
For these considerations above, on the excitation signal
generator (or transmitter) side, we would like to exlore the
possibility that:
Carrier waves available for backscattering are also able to
communicate productively with existing non-backscatter
clients. This reduces the level of communication conges-
tion.
Separating the deployment of the excitation side and the
receiver side, thus increasing the ﬂexibility of the device
and bringing about a potential increase in communication
distance.
Sending control message to tags that tags can recognise
them in a low-power state. MAC protocol gives the
backscatter system the ability to coordinate dozens or
more tags.
B. As Tag
In general, an IoT system consists of a number of low-
energy and power-rich devices, and so does backscatter sys-
tems. A bottleneck in the development and popularity of theInternet of Things is the issue of energy for sensors [11]. Most
commodity IoT sensors require a stored power supply, such as
battery or using solar power. They are not durable or reliable
enough if there is a lack of manual maintenance.
Power consumption can be reduced if the tag does not need
to generate its own carrier waves. We can start by looking at
how passive RFID tags reﬂect signals. RFID readers transmit
a continuous waveform as carrier and demodulate the reﬂected
signal, while tags do not contain any RF Generator. The tag
converts a portion of the signal into energy to maintain the
integrated circuit running at the tag, then reﬂects another
portion of the signal to the reader. The tag modulates the
message onto the carrier sine wave by switching the impedance
of the antenna.
Fig. 2. Passive RFID tag structure for reﬂecting signals
The backscattered waveform received at the reader is in-
ﬂuenced by two relatively independent factors: the antenna
structure and the antenna impedance. Geometrical and material
characteristics of the antenna do affect the pattern of scattered
signal, but can be detached from the effect of the antenna
impedance. By switching the impedance of the antenna, the
tag will send backscattered signal with difference phase and
amplitude. The reader demodulates the reﬂected signal to
recover the information from the tag. As shown in Fig. 2, the
tag embeds information into the incident continuous waveform
by switching its inner impedance between several impedance
states.
To understand how the impedance affects the backscattered
signal, the antenna structure of the tag can be transformed
into an equivalent circuit according to Thevenin’s theorem, as
shown in Fig. 3.
The impedance of the tag antenna includes the antenna
impedanceZA=RA+jXAand the tag impedance ZT=
RT+jXTwhich is controllable for the integrated circuit.
The reﬂection coefﬁcient is deﬁned as   =ZT Z
A
ZT+ZA, whichFig. 3. Equivalent RLC circuit for the tag antenna impedance
determines the relationship between the incidence ﬁeld and
scattering ﬁeld [12]. Maximum transmission strength (   = 0 )
can be achieved by matching the tag impedance to the antenna
(ZT=Z
A). In Fig. 2, the tag enables the binary modulation
of analogue signals by switching the tag impedance between
ZT=Z1andZT=Z2. We can also accomplish higher
order modulation by setting a larger set of tag impedance
values. Radio waves carry information with nothing more
than amplitude, frequency and phase. The switching approach
consumes ultra low energy, and it is ideal for application on
other commodity radios.
In order to design backscattering tags on commodity radios,
we want the backscatter modulation transforms one valid
codeword to another valid one. If the standard waveform
carries bits by amplitude, a tag can modify its amplitude,
and this is also true for frequency and phase. The ultimate
aim of this is to enable the commodity receivers to decode
backscattered bits, rather than forced to equip bespoke ends.
The speciﬁc ways in signal modiﬁcation is described in section
III–IV.
Another step that generates signiﬁcant energy consumption
is the demodulation and decoding of the received signal. The
tag only sends data for a short time and its communication
module is mostly dormant. However, for reasons of function-
ality and fault tolerance, it is necessary to coordinate with the
backscatter controller when to send sensor data. This requires
the tag to keep listening for control messages on the target
channel all the time.
Fortunately, tags can get control message from the coordi-
nator without demodulation and decoding. FreeRider passes
control messages to tags via the envelope detector, which
detects the length of a packet. An envelop detector consumes
much less power than a demodulator [1]. It is often ﬁsible
for the coordinator or exciter to vary the packet length
somewhat freely during productive communications, as most
commodity radio protocols support sending data in segments
and reassembling it, and the length of physical layer packets
is not visible to application layer data.
Overall, the tag plays a low-energy role, then there are a
number of ways in which we can reduce the power consump-tion during communications:
Eliminates the demand to generate carriers at the tag. This
is achieved by reﬂecting existing commodity waveforms
using RFID-like methods.
Eliminates the need for demodulation or decoding at the
tag. This is achieved by transmitting control messages in
packet lengths rather than modulated codewords.
C. As Receiver
The precursor work has given a solution to improve the
effective communication distance between the tag and the
receiver by deploying the excitation generator and the receiver
separately [13]. Because power-rich receivers for commodity
signals are often numerous in the environment, it is beneﬁcial
to make full use of them to improve the success rate of
backscatter communications.
If the packet length modulation mentioned in section II-B is
used, the coordinator has to be specialized for changing packet
lengths, but the receiver does not. Packets with packet length
modulation can be aggregated normally by non-backscatter
devices.
Ideally, by getting error reports in the received data packets
from physical layer, any receivers in the local area network
(LAN) can co-operate in obtaining the embedded data from
the tag, as shown in Fig. 4.
Fig. 4. (1) RFID style backscatter system. (2) Deploying the excitation
generator and the receiver separately [13]. (3) FreeRider Design [1].
According to the tag design discussed in section II-B, since
tags are not aware of what information is encoded in the ex-
citation signal, and unable to distinguish the temporal bound-
aries of the modulated symbols, some destructions of symbol
waveform structure is inevitable in the received backscattered
signal, as shown in Fig. 5. In order for commodity receivers
be able to decode the tag data, the backscattered signal should
contain at least a majority of valid codewords. We can achieve
this by specifying the tag to embed data bits at a lower rate.
The exact time of arrival of the tag bits is not known at the
receiver, creating a greater overhead for tag data demodulation.Nevertheless, these complexities lead to a simpliﬁcation on
tags, while they are not a problem for power-rich devices.
If backscatter is performed on a commodity radio, we
should take advantage of these following conveniences:
A receiver does not necessarily need to take on the task
of coordinating tags. Separating them from the exciter or
coordinator is an option.
Power-rich commodity devices in dispersed physical lo-
cations that can collaborate to obtain tag data over a LAN.
Any commodity device in the environment can become
a receiver with minor software changes.
Power-rich receivers are responsible for the simplicity
of tags. The receiver should be able to decode tag bits
correctly, even if the tag produces some bad symbols.
Fig. 5. Bad symbol occurs in backscattered signals. Using FSK as an
illustration.
III. P RODUCTIVE CARRIER WAVEFORMS
We have to understand how productive commodity wave-
forms are modulated and demodulated before modifying them
with tag bits. Our goal is that the signal after tag modulation
still contains the majority of valid codewords of the same
protocol, allowing non-backscatter devices to recognise these
packets.
A. Amplitude Shift Keying
A tag can implement ASK on an existing continuous
waveform in a simple and low-power way. For example, a
passive RFID tag, described in section II-B, modulates the
amplitude by switching the antenna impedance. By doing so,
a continuous waveform will be converted into two different
amplitudes before it is correctly decoded by the reader. The
carrier amplitude is constant, so different modiﬁcation in
amplitude represent the corresponding codewords.
However, if we want to use a signal that has been amplitude-
modulated as a carrier, remember that there is no way for
a tag to know exactly what each symbol in the carrier
contains. Any ASK standard modulates the signal to a ﬁnite
number of different amplitudes. Once the reﬂection coefﬁcient
  =ZT Z
A
ZT+ZAvaries, it derives at least one additional different
amplitude unless it makes the amplitude zero and it represents
a valid codeword. Non-zero amplitude modiﬁcation by tags
either produce bad codewords or is ignored as an attenuation
at the receiver.
A productive signal would never be a continuous waveform,
and we do not have an effective means of performing expectednon-zero amplitude alternation. It is preferable to avoid impos-
ing amplitude modulation at the tag if zero amplitude is not a
legal symbol in the original transmission.
B. Frequency Shift Keying
In binary frequency shift keying, a bit ‘1’ is transmitted at
a higher frequency f1, while a bit ‘0’ is transmitted at a lower
frequencyf0. At a frequency interval f=f1 f0, The
baseband waveform moves back (  f
2) and forth ( +f
2) on
a circle to represent bit zero and one.
As we all know, a mixer is a non-linear circuit that generates
a new frequency from the two input signals. A mixer produces
in the output signal a component of the product of the two
inputs.
cos(2ft)cos(2ft)
=1
2cos(2(f+ f)t) +1
2cos(2(f f)t)(1)
The mixer therefore spreads the frequency finto two
new frequencies f+ fandf f[14]. To make the
demodulation unambiguous, we want only one of these two
derived frequencies to be a valid symbol (Fig. 6). Fortunately,
this can be guaranteed under certain conditions, even if the
tag is unaware of the exact frequency carrier symbols.
Fig. 6. A mixer spreads one frequency into a upper one and a lower one.
Only one of them is a valid codeword.
In Fig. 6, consider an alphabet of size n, wherenis an
even number. Adjacent frequencies in the alphabet are equally
spaced. For a particular frequency, without loss of generality,
letkn
2. Then for the mixer input f, We wantfk f
to be a valid codeword, but fk+ fis not. We can achieve
this by simply setting ftofn
2 f0for allfk.
The invalid frequency generated by the tag can be elim-
inated with a bandpass ﬁlter at the tag or the receiver. In
Bluetooth,n= 2, and any frequency components outside the
target ISM radio channel is considered as interference and
ignored. That is, as long as f1+f >fHandf0 f <fL,
the demodulator then automatically ignores these unintended
components. For an ISM channel bandwidth w=fH fL, as
a rule the modulation indexf1 f0
wis0:5, so it is feasible not
to purposely eliminate unintended frequencies from a tag.
Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) aims to smooth
the transitions of the modulated signal. One signiﬁcant ad-
vantage of this ﬁlter is its ability to reduce sideband powerand interference with neighboring channels. Though Gaussian
ﬁltering increases the inter symbol interference (ISI), it does
not change the central frequency, and there is no need to
reconﬁgure frequency shift operations of the tag.
C. Phase Shift Keying
PSK transmits bits with phase differences. For M-PSK, the
symbols can be expressed as:
S(t) =Acos (2(i
M+ft));
wherei= 0;1;:::;M  1(2)
Fig. 7. Constellation diagram of the QPSK symbol change trajectory.
4-PSK, also known as QPSK, is a form of M-PSK. Fig. 7
shows that on a constellation diagram, bits are represented by
four symmetrical points located around a circle. In (3), we can
transform one to another valid codeword at the tag by delaying
the signal in the time domain, and the value of kcorresponds
to the tag bits in the alphabet.
S0(t) =S(t tT)
=Acos (2(i
M+f(t tT)))
=Acos (2i k
M);
wheretT=1
fk
Mandk= 0;1;:::;M  1(3)
The presence of 180° phase shifts causes the envelope
of the signal to pass through zero instantaneously, which is
reﬂected in the spectrum as a broadening. The Offset QPSK
modulation method gives a solution that prohibits 180° phase
shifts, as at most one of the in-phase signal and the quadrature
signal toggles its polarity at the same symbol boundary after
introducing a half-bit offset between I and Q bit sequences.
There is a conﬂiction between modifying the OQPSK signal
at the tag and preserving the validity of the symbol sequence,
since based on our design goals discussed in II-B, generating
180° phase shifts in the backscattered signal is unavoidable.
Thankfully a tag is only expected to ensure that most of
Fig. 8. OQPSK avoids 180° phase shifts by introducing a half-bit offset
between two orthogonal BPSK signals.
the symbol sequence is decodeable, so that the receiver can
recognise them.
A signiﬁcant proportion of devices today modulates OQPSK
signals by minimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation. MSK
uses one sine wave of constant amplitude similar to FSK to
modulate the phase, as shown in Fig. 9, rather than a rectangle
from OQPSK symbol switching. It leads to a more constant
envelope than two BPSK signals stacked.
Fig. 9. MSK waveform representing consecutive symbols: 00, 01, 01.
In MSK, the current phase and the upcoming bit determines
whether the waveform goes forward or backward. The reason
why two frequencies +fand fare enough for keeping in
phase with OQPSK modulated signal, is that the polarity of
the two orthogonal components changes in turn. There is no
such codeword sequence as “00, 01, 00”.
Though OQPSK has been implemented with minimum-shift
keying, it is still not appropriate for the tag to do phase shifting
in a frequency shift manner. As we introduced in section III-B,
a mixer always produces an unexpected frequency component.
This causes interference and ambiguity in phase. If a tag
toggles its mixer input to perform a 90 degrees phase shift,
the expected behaviour is that it will invert the trajectory of
the original waveform. but it results in two different phases inone symbol when non-minimum frequencies are not ﬁltered.
If performing a 180 degrees phase shift, it is prone to produce
consecutive decoding failure and conﬂict with the minimum
frequency. Therefore, applying time domain delays rather than
frequency shifting is the appropriate method for phase shift
keying.
IV. B ACKSCATTER PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTATION
A. Frequency Modulation on Bluetooth
In Bluetooth, two available symbols means that there are
two states of the reﬂection on the tag: Applying a frequency
f=f2 f1or0to the mixer. One state represents one
tag bit. In order to keep the structure of most symbols for
decodability, we would like to keep the send rate of tag data
down, i. e. multiple symbols carry one tag bit.
The Bluetooth modules on receivers will decode the signal
from a backscatter device in a normal way. Receivers knows
that the tag embeds with bit ‘0’ if the backscattered codeword
is the same as the carrier’s original codeword, or bit ‘1’
if it is different. There is no need to worry about some
decoding errors for multiple symbols carrying one bit. We
get a maximum transfer rate of (1000=n)Kbps ifnsymbols
carrying one tag bit.
B. Phase Modulation on ZigBee
Based on section III-C, we can introduce at most four differ-
ent modiﬁcations 0;
2;;3
2on QPSK or OQPSK modulated
signals. The phase shift will cause decoding errors since a
symbol sequence contains simultaneous reversal of polarity is
not valid in OQPSK.
Notice that if we only enable 0andphase delays, the
modiﬁed signal has a good property that the decoded bit
sequence still has a continuous inverse taken. This is obvious
while considering that the signal is a stack of two BPSK
signals, meanwhile we have another way to view what would
happen ifphase shift applied.
A codeword ‘00’ (or ‘11’) stands for consecutive zeros
(ones), and it is converted to ‘11’(or ‘00’).
A codeword ‘01’ (or ‘10’) stands for a ﬂip in the bit
sequence, and it is converted to ‘10’ (or ‘01’).
So ideally we would get an exactly reversed decoded bit
sequence. This provides facilitation on decoding and error
correction. In this case it is meaningful to make multiple
symbols carrying one tag bit, not only does it reduce decoding
failures caused by corrupting phase continuity, but sidesteps
the difﬁculty of tag bits recovery due to undesirable inversions
on the tag bit boundary.
To take advantage of this concise property, we now make
a convention that only a phase delay of 0 or 180 degrees are
allowed at the tag. And we will utilize this for decoding at the
receiver in section IV-C.
C. Decoding Tag Bits at Receivers
We have described the criteria for generating FSK and
OQPSK backscatter signals in section IV-A and IV-B, so
naturally there are corresponding decoding processes for thereceiver. It is anticipated that the bit error rate (BER) is close
to 0 in an ideal noise-free channel. To verify that the tag bits
are correctly decoded in line with expectations, a simulation
was run on Matlab based on the following constraints:
The exciters and receivers are connected in a rela-
tively reliable commodity network, so bit errors in non-
backscatter communication are corrected by the software.
In realistic scenarios, backscatter communications are
difﬁcult to succeed if non-backscatter ones are no longer
stable.
We simply assume that if more than half of the carrier
bits in which one tag bit locates is ﬂipped, the receiver
treats it as bit ‘1’, otherwise ‘0’.
Fig. 10. Decoding BER in frequency shift modulation while embedding one
tag bit into N= 4 or8symbols.
Fig. 11. Decoding BER in offset phase shift modulation while embedding
one tag bit into N= 4 or8symbols.
Note that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) baseline is deﬁned
on non-backscatter communication, i. e. the carrier wave. In
Fig. 10 and 11, adjusting Nfrom 4 to 8 signiﬁcantly improved
the BER performance. However continuing to increase Nwill
no more make a sharp improve. For example, when SNR =
 8in FSK, changing Nfrom 8 to 16 only reduces the BER
from approximately 12% to 10%, as there are already too
many bit errors in the carrier signal. N= 16 similarly showed
attenuated improvement in offset QPSK.
N= 8 performs greater performance improvement in
OQPSK than FSK, partly due to N= 4’s difﬁculty in dealingwith destruction of phase continuity caused by phase delay
at the tag.
V. C ONCLUSION
The innovation of FreeRider is that its backscatter system
works on productive commodity radio, which is supposed
to reduce the collisions and congestions in the target radio
band. At the same time, the hardware requirements were
simpliﬁed for a software-conﬁgured commodity gateway or
terminal can serve as an exciter or coordinator [1]. While
an exclusive hardware at the exciter is no longer forced, it
complicates the decoding process at the receivers. Another
thing is that although the exciter does not need to produce
non-productive (or backscatter-only) communications, packet
length modulation as required by a MAC protocol still re-
quires an coordinator with speciﬁc software functionality. So
compared with previous works [9], [10], it is a compromise
plan that does not beneﬁt both the transmitter and the receiver.
In a crowded environment with devices, FreeRider’s interfer-
ence avoidance sheme [1] may be ineffective, and therefore
may have difﬁculty truly improving radio band efﬁciency in
production environments.
