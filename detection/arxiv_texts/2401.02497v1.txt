Abstract  
The deformation behavior of nearly full y pear litic, bainitic and martensitic steels during severe plastic 
deformation is summarized in this paper. Despite their significant ly different yield stress es and their  
microstructure s, their hardening behavior  during SPD  is similar. Due to the enormous hardening 
capacity the SPD deformation is limited by the strength of the tool materials. The microstructure at 
the obtainable limit of strain are quite similar, which is a nanocrystalline  structure in the order of 10 
nm, depend ent on the obtainable st rain. The nanograins are partially  supersaturated with carbon and 
the grain boundaries are stabilized by carbon. A nother  characteristic feature is the anisotropy in grain 
shape which results in an anisotropy of strength, ductili ty and fracture toughness. The results are 
important for the development of ultra -strong materials and essential for this type of steels which are 
frequently used for application where the behavior under rolling contact and slidin g contact is 
important.

1 Motivation  
Carbon -based steels, such as pearlitic, bainitic  and martensitic ones, have played an important role in 
the industrial development of our society and are widely used in a n enormous  number of applications. 
Among application fields, such in construction, civil or mechanical engineering, these “simple” ste els, 
mainly consisting of iron and carbon, are a backbone of the railway transportation sector. In this field 
particularly  pearlitic and bainitic qualities are used  for rails and crossings. The degradation and lifetime 
of rails is controlled by the typical  stress state. In certain service situations high contact forces 
combined with shear forces act in the contact zone between rail and wheel and lead to so-called rolling 
contact fatigue (RC F) [1,2] . Typical RCF related def ects, such as headchecks and squats  can arise and 
endanger the traffic safety [3]. 
Field investigations showed that these conditions also lead to drastic material modifications on the rail 
surface with widely unkn own mechanical property changes, which will dictate the RCF -behavior  [4,5] . 
It was found that by means of Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) such structures can be experimentally 
simulated to study the microstructural evolution and connected mechanical changes under better 
experime ntal control providing well defined strains and environmental conditions  [6,7] . Therefore, 
beside other emerging application fields of SPD -processed materials, for example as medical implants, 
the modification of rail steels by high pressure to rsion (HPT) represents an indirect industrial 
application field. This is not only restricted to  rail steels  but can find a more general application where 
high contact pressure and shear forces dominate the stress state and material degradation. F or 
instanc e, in bearings  or gear wheels  often consisting of martensitic qualities , similar damage events 
and material modification such as the occurrence of white etching layers can be found, which threaten 
the safe operation of machines [8,9] . The near surface deformation during rolling contact of these 
components can be considered as  a SPD surface treatment.  2 
 The importance of the microstructural changes of such steels for the understanding of the material 
strengthening, but also the connected changes in ductility and fracture resistance motivated us to give 
an overview on the most important structural features  and changes  of pearlitic, bainitic and 
martensitic steels  during SPD.  
2 Structural evolution of steels during SPD   
2.1 Pearlitic steels during  wire drawing  
Although wire drawing has been practiced for hundreds of years  [10], the theoretical framework to 
understand the underlying mecha nical and metallurgical processes was just built in the past 60 years. 
To date, cold -drawn pearlitic steels belong to the best studied steels in SPD. Since the seminal work of 
Embury and Fisher in 1966 [11] on pearlitic steels , the evolution of structural features during wire 
drawing was extensively studied. The authors revealed decreasing ferrite cell size with smaller wi re 
diameter, which is the  source for the strengthening with increasing drawing strain. The flow stress , σf, 
can be predicted from  the imposed drawing strain, εd, using  a model based on Hall -Petch hardening  
with th e initial ferrite spacing , d0, and the empi rically developed Hall-Petch constant , k:  
𝜎𝑓=𝜎𝑖+𝑘
√2√𝑑0exp⁡(𝜀𝑑
4)        (Eq. 1) 
Because of the strong correlation between drawing strain and grain refinement [12], the strength can 
be directly linked to the square root of the ferrite lamellae spacing, d, with the mean shear modulus 
of ferrite and cementite, G, and the respective burgers vectors for a dislocation in cementite , bcm, and 
ferrite, b , and a constant, α = 0.7:  
𝜎𝑓=𝜎𝑖+0.35𝐺√𝑏𝑐𝑚
𝑑+αG𝑏
𝑑       (Eq. 2) 
Thus, t he strength is controlled by the average slip distance of a dislocation in ferrite . This knowledge 
built the cornerstone of describing strengthening in severely drawn pearlite for a long time.

The ferrite lamellae spacing  prior to drawing is  typically in the range of 100-300 nm and refines to 
values well below 1 0 nm  for the highest drawing strains of εd = 6.52 [15]. This goes along with an overall 
transition from a colony structure into a nanolamellar compound  of ferrite and cementite aligned 
along the drawing direction [13,14,16 –18]. Thereby, the  cementite  phase  considerably affects the 
structural evolution . Though, its intermetallic nature would suggest a brittle behavior, it can plastically 
deform if it is thin enough [11,19,20] . Below 10 nm thickness it undergoes large plastic deformation 
[12,21,22]  and thereby promotes str uctural refinement. During wire drawing the cementite may 
fragment or deform  [23], which  depends also on the initial alignment within the colony with respect 
to the drawing direction  [14,22,24] . The refinement of the lamellae in colonies being aligned parallel 
to the drawing direction is most efficient ( Figure 1a), as a realignment of the cementite is not required 
and the imposed strain mainly causes a thinning of the lamellae. In colonies where the lamellae are 
aligned perpendicular to the wire axis, the largest re -orientation needs to be realized and t herefore 
the interlamellar spacing appears  larger at moderate drawing strains. The zig -zag structure is a 
consequence of compressive straining , yielding and buckling of the ceme ntite in case of fine pearlite. 
However, brittle fragmentation without considerable thinning  of the cementite would be observed for 
coarser pearlite . The realignment of cementite lamellae  is accompanied  with the evolution of a curling 
structure ( Figure 1b) perpendicular to the drawing a xis [14,25] . Thus , efficient grain refinement and 
strengthening in such wires relies on an optimum starting structures, e.g. optimum rolling and cooling 
parameters during pre -manufacturing or lea d patenting is necessary [26].  
 
Figure 2 Decohesion  along the wire drawing 
axis for the lamellar architecture ( εd=3.1) as 
well as for the nanograined one ( εd=6.52) 
emphasizes the importance of the elongated 
interfaces for mechanical properties [27]. 
 
 
 
In accordance to the knowledge gain ed over the past decades, the wire drawing procedure could be 
optimized so that diameter reductions down to  20 µm thickness are accessible, i.e. drawing strains of  
εd = 6.52  [15]. This yields a tensile strength of 6.8 GPa  and makes nanostructured pearlitic steels the 
strongest structural material to date. This exceptional strength is a consequence of the severe 
refinement down to 8 nm ferrite spacing ( Figure 1c). Yet, at this stage of deformation the structural 
architecture has changed completely. Instead of a lamellar compound of ferrite and cementite, a 
ferriti c subgrain structure with carbon either supersaturated in the matrix or segregated to boundaries 
develops. This  change in structure  is because severe deformation removes  carbon from the cementite  
[15,17,28 –32]. It thereby becomes off -stoichiometric already at lower drawing strains  due to 
dislocation drag of carbon atoms [33], which then  segregate to the interface [34]. Similarities in the 
fracture surfaces at εd = 3 (nanolamellar composite) and εd = 6.52  (nanograined  ferrite) suggest, that 
still the interfaces in the drawing direction largely control mechanical properties ( Figure 2) [27]. They 
are source for delamination upon failure, irrespective whether the cementite is stoichiometric [35], 
becoming non -stochiometric [36,37]  or already transforms to a carbon film along the interface [27]. 
However, t he transfer of a lamellar architecture to a single -phase nanocrystalline alloy reduces  
ductility and toughness [27,38] , albeit deformability remains notably high with respect to its 
4 
 exceptional strength. It is therefore an outstanding example for SPD of steels and an inspiring role 
model for other methods o f severe plastic deformation, such as HPT, equal channel angular pressing 
and accumulative roll bonding.   
2.2 HPT deformation of pearlitic steels  
Despite the differences in the deformation mode t he structural changes, when pearlitic  steels are 
deformed by quasi -constrained HPT, are  very similar to wire drawing ( Figure 3, first row)  [39–42]: i) 
the initially random colony structure is transformed into  a lamellar nanocomposite with the ferrite and 
cementite lamellae fully aligned along the shearing direction of the HPT disc  (εv = 11); ii) the 
realignment of the cementite proceeds faster in colonies already being aligned parallel to the HPT 
shearing direction (very fine lamellar spacing at εv = 3), while in colonies being initially perpendicular ly 
oriented,  a zig -zag structure is present  (coarse structure at εv = 5); iii) the cementite becomes off -
stoichiometric because of the dissolution of carbon atoms in the ferrite matrix  [43]. Due to the high 
hydrostatic pressure compared to wire drawing, the initial thickness of cementite is less important for 
the successful processing.  
 
Figure 3 Structural evolution during HPT with increasing equivalent strain , εv,  for different steel grades during high pressure 
torsion: pearlite ( R260, first row ,[44]),  bainite ( Dobain, second row), martensite ( Ck10, third row).   
Despite these similarities in the deformation procedure the final structure of HPT -processed pearlitic 
steels remains a nanocomposite at drawing strains of  εv = 16 ( Figure 4) instead of a nanograined ferritic 
steel . Thereby,  transmis sion electron microscopy ( TEM ) images reveal a two -fold nature of the pearlitic 
structure. In regions, where the initial lamellar alignment parallel to HPT shearing direction enables 
continuous thinning of the cementite, a perfect ly lamellar compound of fe rrite and cementite with an 
interlamellar spacing of 10 -15 nm develops  (Figure 4a). Contrast changes suggest that the ferrite phase 
is potentially  subdivided into subgrains  at moderate strains of εv = 1.2  (Figure 4d) and are most like ly 
still present at  higher degree of deformation , but unfortunately  not experimentally accessible due to 
the limited resolution of focused ion beam . However, this substructure is  significantly larger in length 
with respect to the lamellar thickness which s hould  make the latter  the strength controlling spacing. 
The second region consists of a slightly coarser structure, where elongated ferrite grains dominate 
(Figure 4b). This structure might evolve  either  from already initially imperfect regions or from former 
5 
 colonies in which the cementite is unfavorably aligned with respect to the shearing direction and  rather 
breaks or plastically ruptures. Still , the  scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) images  in Figure 3 suggest 
that the lamellar structure predomina tes, which is reflected also in a pronounced anisotropy of 
mechanical properties [38,41,45] . Unlike to drawn wires , during HPT a planar alignment of the 
structural features is observed perpendicular to the main deformation direction (e.g. in TAN view, 
Figure 4c).

architecture: a) perfectly lamellar arrangement of 
cementite and ferrite and b) elongated nanocrystalline 
ferrite grains when cementite is disrupted  [41].

Electron energy loss spectroscopy reveal s that the cementite becomes off -stoichiometric in these 
lamellar regions [43]. According to atom probe tomography (APT) analysis [47] the carbon 
concentration in the lamellae drops to values below 10 at% and gets redistributed to the ferrite matrix 
and its boundaries  (Figure 5a). Thereby, the carbon concentration continuously decreases over the 
interface from the former cementite to the ferrite. This suggests, that processes such as dislocation 
drag or wear, initiating a continuous detachment of carbon atoms, govern the dissolution of lamellar 
cementi te [47,4 8]. Yet, the non -stoichiometry of cementite increases with strain and it thereby 
transforms into a carbon -rich phase, that might have different mechanical properties as compared to 
the original cementite [45]. Earlier HPT approaches, using an unconstrained setup and thereby 
imposing nominal strains of εv = 245 to a pearlitic steel [49], even report a complete dissolution of 
cementite according to x-ray diffraction ( XRD) and thermomagnetic measurements. However, at the 
highest strains viable by quasi -constrained HPT ( εv = 16) only a moderate loss of carbon appears and  a 
two-phase nanolamellar architecture 
prevails.

 Comparing the interlamellar spacing and the structural architecture at the maximum drawing strains 
of the different SPD techniques  suggests diff erent efficiencies in refining pearlitic steels. While for cold 
drawing comparatively smaller strains of εd = 6.52 are sufficient to achieve ferrite subgrains with 8 nm 
spacing, during quasi -constrained HPT such small spacings cannot be achieved even at hi gher 
equivalent strains of εv = 16. The ferrite spacing of roughly 15 nm and the moderate dissolution of the 
HPT structure correlates to drawing strains between εd = 2 (minor dissolution, 30 nm ferrite spacing, 
Figure 1c) and εd = 4 (distinct carbon enrichment in the matrix and at subgrain boundaries, 12 nm 
ferrite spacing Figure 1c) [15,17,50] . Even during unconstrained HPT nominal  strains as high as εv = 245 
are necessary to achieve prevalence  of a single phase structure, e.g. 10 nm ferrite grains wit h C 
stabilizing the interfaces ( Figure 5b) [49].

HPT process, albeit a zig -zag 
structure remains.   
The decelerated structural evolution as a function of strain is a consequence of differences in the strain 
path during wire drawing and HPT and partly of the differen t initial lamellar spacing . For co -
deformation of the ferrite and the cementite  during HPT , the lamellae spacing for the most efficient 
starting arrangement for refinement,  e.g. cementite lame llae parallel to the torsion axi s and the radial 
direction, at large  shear strain s, γ, is: 
   𝑑=𝑑0
𝛾          (Eq. 3)  
For wire drawing the most efficient  lamella e arrangement for refinement is parallel to the drawing 
axis,  and the spacing during can be calculated according to:  
𝑑=𝑑0
𝑒𝜀𝑑2⁄          (Eq. 4)  
For this si mplified assumption and for the considered cases a ferrite lamellae spacing of 4 nm and 8  
nm could be estimated for wire drawing and HPT, respectively. The deviation by a factor of two is 
mainly caused from the initial random oriented lamellae within the colonies.  The existence of  a strain 
path dependenc y has been reported earlier [51] and is supported also by the structural evolution 
obtained during cyclic high pressure torsion ( CHPT, Figure 6) [39]. In addition to differences in the 
inter lamellar spacing the realignment of the structural features proceeds at slower  rates  during CHPT . 
While at εv = 8 most of the lamellae are aligned along the shearing direction during quasi -constrained 
HPT, ruptured carbides  (Δεeq = 0.5 , second column ) or a zig -zag structure  (Δεeq = 4, third column ), still 
dominate for CHPT , depending on the strain amplitude imposed per cycle.  Especially for low  cyclic  
amplitudes deformation of cementite is negligible, even at elevated strains of  εeq = 32. The lamellar 
refinement at large amplitudes better resembles the monot onic HPT structure, albeit a  full lamellar 
alignment  is still not accessible at εeq = 32 .  
7 
 Thus, a refinement of the pearlitic  structure to below 10 nm and the dissolution of the cementite 
phase, as observed for wire drawing is to date not accessible by HPT. One of the first HPT works in this 
field [49] observed a non -linear increase in hardness over shear strain and reported hardness values 
of more than 10 GPa at strains of εv = 245 ( Figure 5c). Yet, a one to one co mparison with quasi -
constrained HPT, causing linearly increasing hardness values (data from Figure 7b converted to GPa in 
Figure 5c for comparison ), might not be straight forward with respect to the rate of carbon dissolution 
and structural evolution. Regarding deformation of such high -strength materials the possibility of 
slippage between anvil and sample always should be considered.  Also for quasi -constrained HPT a 
structure more closely to the one achieved by wire drawing [15] or unconstrained HPT [49] would be 
accessible, if higher strains could be applied. However, the tool steel anvils restrict maximum 
deformability for quasi -constrained HPT to below 800 HV. This is clearly seen in the maximum 
achievable hardness values of the pearli tic steel grades, which do not exceed the anvil hardness ( Figure 
7) [44,52] . Once the deformed steels reach the hardness of the anvils, either slippage of the sample 
within the cavity of the HPT anvils or deformation of the anvil itself occurs. Thus, although the material 
might also get deformed beyond this hardness regime, the strict correlation between imposed HPT 
deformation angle and measured strain level gets lost. This should be always taken into account when 
HPT data a re presented for a higher strains. Yet, from the current state an alternative anvil material 
could be a prospective solution, as for instance drawing dies either out of hard metal or polycrystalline 
diamond that provide high hardness and therefore enable h igh drawing strains.

2.3 Structural evolution of quenched steels  
Although  HPT deformed high carbon steels deformed with conventional steel anvils cannot reach the 
outstanding strength of 6.8 GPa of severely drawn pearlitic steels with the quasi-constrained  setup, 
the HPT technique is applicable to a wider range of steel grades. In contrast to c old drawing of wires , 
HPT does not  rely on a n optimized starting structure providing sufficient ductility to prevent cracking 
of the wires. Instead , steel grades with  limited deformation capabilities, such as bainitic and 
martensitic steels, can also be processed . This is possible  by the hydrostatic pressure, which suppresses 
large scale cracking in the samples up to a certain degree of deformation . 
As an example, Figure 3 shows the deformation of a  lower bainit ic steel , initially consist ing of ferrite 
plates and carbide precip itates [53]. The bainitic plates are a couple of microns wide  and t he carbides 
are evenly distributed within the ferrite plate s but randomly in the overall structure ( Figure 3, second 
row, εv = 0). The ferrite plates deform uniforml y, forming a lamellar shape similar as observed in the 
pearlitic steel. However, the carbides  fragment  (εv = 1), realign along the shearing direction of the HPT 
disc ( εv = 4), but their thickness does not refine  considerably ( εv = 8). Continuous thinning is inhibited 
by their larger  size and their discontinuous nature  compared to the cementite lamellae of pearlite, 
preventing  co-deformation of the two phases . Nonetheless, the final structure  is constituted by 
8 
 nanostructured ferrite gra ins lengthened  along the HPT shearing direction and delineated by a carbon 
phase, which is very similar to drawn  pearlitic wires despite the ir different starting architecture . Also  
the maximum achievable hardness does not exceed 770 HV ( Figure 7a), thus further refinement and  
strengthening is restricted again by the tool  steel  anvils. 
Deformation of a quenched lath martensite is also possible  by tool steel anvils as long as the carbon 
concentration is low enough. For the Ck10  martensitic low carbon steel , consisting of ferrite laths being 
200 nm in width , a similar structural evol ution as  shown  for bainitic steels  takes place  (Figure 3, third 
row εv = 0). This is a  consecutive  realignment of the initial lath structure towards the shearing direction 
of the HPT disc ( εv = 5), followed by a refinement of the already aligned fe rrite laths (εv = 9) and a 
transformation into a lamellar ferrite structure ( εv = 14). The fully aligned ferrite structure revealed by 
TEM at εv = 15 (Figure 9) is identical to the lamellar regions of HPT deformed pearlitic steel grades 
(compare Figure 4a) [54], besides the absenc e of a d elineating, continuous carbon -rich film . 
Nevertheless, the nanolamellar structure is stabilized by carbon at the grain boundaries.

column ) and after HPT deformation (seco nd column)  of different

and c) high carbon steel 100Cr6 , reprinted from  [56] with

Usually, HPT deformation of single phase materials 
yields such elongated grains only if boundary 
migration processes, sustaining a more globular 
grain shape, are suppressed  under specific 
deformation temperatures [57,58] . As HPT was 
carried out at room temperature, the formation of 
such a lamellar ferrite arch itecture is therefore only 
possible, because th e boundaries are stabilized by 
the segregated  carbon atoms [54]. APT 
measurements re vealed that almost the entire 
carbon atoms, dissolved in the martensitic matrix in 
the as -quenched condition , were transferred t o the 
ferrite grain boundaries  by strain induced 
segregation. However, the realignment of the martensitic structure requires a higher degree of HPT 
deformation.  In Figure 3a nearly  full alignment is observed at εv = 4 and 5 for the pearlitic and bainitic 
grades, respectively, while strains as high as εv = 14 are required for the martensitic steel.  Probably, 
the need to transfer carbon atoms dissolved in the matrix  from regions insid e the ferrite laths to the 
boundaries by solute drag of dislocations [34] requires higher strain levels compared to the 
realignment of cementite and carbide in pearlite and bainite, respectively. S till, it is notable that small 
carbon concentration of only 0.1  wt% are sufficient to synthesize a mean ferrite lamellae spacing of 
only  about  30 nm yielding  750 HV at strains of εv = 15 (Figure 9a). This is about one order of magnitude 
smaller as the mi nimum structural size obtained in  ARMCO  iron ( 200nm  subgrains  [59] and 310nm 
grains [60]). Thus, also with such lean -alloyed steels the critical  hardness limit  inherent to deformation 
with tool steel anvils, a s usually observed for eutectoid  steels , is attained.   
It should be mentioned that deformation of inherently more brittle materials like  high -carbon  
martensitic steels is possible and yields exceptional strength values  [54,61] , however, it goes alon g 
with crack formation at elevated strains . Deformation to even higher strain levels is therefore impeded 
9 
 not only by the hardness of the tool steel anvils but also by deformation -induced cracking , often 
related to stress relief during unloading . Based on the results o f the Ck10 , deformation of marten sitic 
steels with even higher carbon concentrations would promise further  strengthening, in case that the 
additi onal carbon -content stabilizes an even finer microstructure [62]. Indeed , a hardness of 1025  HV 
is achieved at εv ~ 32 after HPT  with 0.6 wt% carbon  (Figure 9b at r = 3 and 720° ), but the strengthening 
upon deformation, e.g. increasing deformation angle, is not pronounced. This is  a consequence of the  
already  initial  high  hardness of  825 HV  for the Ck60  in the as -quenched state ( Figure 9b). Unlike the 
Ck10, exhibiting only 425 HV ( Figure 9a), the Ck60 exceeds the hardness of the tool steel anvil already 
prior to deformation. A realignment and consecutive refinement of the lath structure is therefore not 
pronounced  (Figure 8b), as rather slippage between sample and anvil or deformation of the anvil itself 
takes place.   
For the observed hardness increase of the Ck60 by 200 HV two points are assumed to be  essential. 
First, smaller HPT discs (diameter of 6 mm for Ck60 instead of 8 mm for Ck10) enabled a higher 
hydrostatic pressure. Slippage and  propensity for crack initiati on, usually inhibiting further  
deformation of the structure , could  thereby  be retard ed. S econd, the Ck60 contains  in the as -quenched 
state  of about 5%  of retained austenite. Due to the softer nature of this phase  it could  be further 
deformed  (e.g. at least  substructure formation) . In addition, the austenite is transform ed into 
marten site during deformation, thus, contri buting to the hardness increase  by a deformation -induced 
phase transformation . Yet , more investigations are required to analyze the contribu tions of these two 
effects .

gray bars indicate the 
hardness of the as -quenched 
state.  
 
 
Even if high hydrostatic pressure prevents slippage and crack formation, the applied strain is split into 
deformation of the sample and the anvils in an uncontrolled way if the strength of the sample is equal 
or even larger than the strength of the anvils.  Well -defined  HPT deformation of martensitic grades 
with elevated carbon -content is therefore only possible, when the hardness of the anvil is considerably 
higher than the starting material to ensure its deformation . A prospective solution is the use of ha rd 
metal anvils. This is shown for a 100Cr6 steel, deformed by HPT after oil quenching and  subsequent  
tempering , leading to a  plate  martensitic matrix with homogenously distributed  spheroidal cementite 
[56]. Compared to the Ck10 the starting structure is significantly coarser, as the plates have thicknesses 
between 160 nm and 1.2 µm.  Despite a high initial hardness of roug hly 825 HV and usage of a quasi -
constrained setup the matrix refines with similar  efficien cy (Figure 8c) as the martensitic Ck10 ( Figure 
8a) and pearlitic R260 ( Figure 4a) steel grades. An architecture with nanolayered ferrite grains of 20 -
40 nm spacing is achieved [56], yielding a hardness of 1050 HV after only 0.75 revolutions or εv = 9.3 
[63]. Thus, usage of hard metal anvils is a feasible  strategy to overcome the current  hardness limits of 
HPT deformed steels.

 2.4 Strengthening mechanisms in nanolamellar steels  
2.4.1 Hardness evolution with shear strain  
Altogether, the structural evolution of steels dur ing HPT yields in a lamellar architecture  (Figure 10) 
with carbon playing a crucial role in stabilizing ferrite interfaces [52]. Yet, the efficiency to achieve 
structural refinement and so high strength depends on the steel grade that varies in starting 
architecture (lamellar cementite vs. random carbides), initial grain spacing or chemical composition. 
This also complicates a straightforward  comparison of the different synthesis routes (e.g. wire drawing, 
unconstrained HPT, quasi -constrained HPT) as the discussed steel grades also differ in chemical 
composition (compare Table 1). 
According to hardness measurements (see Figure 7a) starting architecture has the larger impact o n the 
hardness evolution than chemical differences. The chemical differences in conjunction with the 
processing parameters are significant for the starting structure.  The hardness of all bainitic grades not 
only surpasses the pearlitic steels at the same strain level, but also attains the anvil hardness (800 HV) 
at lower strain values. This might either be related to the easier alignment of the shorter carbides in 
lower bainite (no co -deformation of ferrite -cementite required) and thus, to a more efficient  
refinement of the ferrite grains, or the coarser cementite -carbides that prevail in the final structure 
additionally contribute to the hardness ( Figure 3, second row).  
 
Figure 10 Schematic illustration of the structural evolution of pe arlitic, bainitic  and martensitic starting materials during quasi -
constrained HPT up to its current limits.  
With focus on pearlitic steels, a smaller initial interlamellar spacing is a further source for improved 
strain hardening. The  hardness of the  finer pearlitic grade (120 nm, see R350HT in Figure 7a) attains 
the anvil hardness already at εv = 12 ( Figure 7a), while the same hardness level requires considerably 
higher strains of εv = 16 for a coarser starting structure (250 nm, see R260 in Figure 7b) [44]. Assuming 
that confined plasticity within the lamellae largely controls the hardness, efficient refinement of its 
spacing could explain this behavior. It relates well to earlier results, revealing th at cementite 
deformability improves with decreasing thickness, thus, interlamellar spacing [12]. The fine cementite 
may accelerat e the realignment of unfavorably aligned  colonies and thereby promotes the overall 
refinement of the composite.  
The impact of alloying on the hardening behavior of pearlitic structures can be seen in the comparison 
of the R350HT and R450HT grades in Figure 7a. Both have an initial lamellar spacing of about 110 nm, 
11 
 but R450HT contains higher carbon, chromium and manganese concentrations. The enhanced alloying 
gives rise for another hardness boost to 750 HV at εv = 5 ( Figure 7a). Also the strain level at which the 
maximum hardness is achieved drops to strains below εv = 6, which is only one third of the strain 
necessary to achieve the same hardness with the standard grade (R260). The hardness increase stems 
thereby from a higher overall cementite fraction, that may reduce the initial lamellar spacing,  due to 
elevated carbon and chromium concentrations, while manganese mainly contributes by solid solution 
hardening [44,64] .

Nevertheless, high hardness and strength values are also accessible for lean alloyed steels. For 
insta nce, despite the low carbon content of only 0.1 wt% in a Ck10 strain hardening is limited by the 
anvil hardness ( Figure 9a) similar to its eutectoid pearlitic counterpart (R260 in Figure 7b). This means, 
that an eight times lower carbon concentration as compared to the pearlitic steel is sufficient to 
stabilize a ferrite grain structure of 30 nm ( Figure 8), capable of reaching 750 HV microhardness at 
strains of εv = 15 (e.g. r = 4 mm in Figure 9a). Carbon segregat ion at the interfaces , but no cementite 
precipitat ion is  found by  XRD and APT measurements after HPT [54]. Yet, an increase in the carbon 
concentration by a factor of six in the Ck60 further boosts the hardness to a maximum of 1050 HV 
(Figure 9b). However, if this is related to a further refinement of the structure [62], solid solution 
hardening [49] or a stronger distortion of the laths leading to  increased internal stresses, has not been 
studied so far. As clearly visible from the only moderate hardness increase with increasing strain , strain 
hardening is not efficient anymore due to experimental r estrictions. As mentioned before, when the 
hardness of the anvil material (tool steel, about 800 HV) is exceeded, slippage and anvil deformation 
minimizes further structural refinement in the sample.    
2.4.2 Strengthening mechanisms in lamellar architectures  
It is still nota ble that despite the different carbon -level and phase distribution, the martensitic Ck10 
and the pearlitic R260 attain simil ar anisotropic strength levels [45,54,66] . This raises the question on 
the nature of ha rdening contributions to such lamellar structures. While for nanopearlitic steels in the 
past mainly the ferrite grain spa cing was considered (compare Eq . 1 in [12]), earlier approaches sum 
up the individual hardening contributions to derive the flow stress σ(ε) with increasing strain [13]: 
𝜎(𝜀)=𝜎0+𝜎(𝑏)+𝜎(𝜌)+𝜎(𝑠𝑠)       (Eq. 5) 12 
 Boundary strengthening, σ(b), increasing dislocation density σ(ρ) and carbon in solid solution, σ(ss), to 
the ferrite friction stress, σ0, contribute to the total strengthening effect . However, according to 
anisotropic deformation experiments on such pearli tic nanocomposites [45,54]  this approach might 
be too simplified. A straight  forward  comparison of different lamellae spacings  by micro compression 
experiments emphasized the importance of dislocation confinement for strengthening [45]. This is 
furthe r supported, when considering that deformation mechanisms in these nanostructures rely on 
emission and accommodation of dislocation within the interfaces [67–69], followed by movement of 
half loops through the lamellar channel in elongated grains. The latter is known as confined layer slip 
and is a well -studied feature in multilayers  [17,70 –75] causing an exceptional strain hardening capacity 
[76] and therefore ductility [38] in such architectures.  
Confined layer slip also controls the flow stress in uniaxial experiments. Aligning the elongated 
structure under an angle inclined to the imposed load, e.g . lamellae parallel to maximum shear stress, 
τ, yields a flow stress that is reflected by the Orowan stress, σor, with the shear modulus in ferrite, G, 
the burgers vector in ferrite, b, Poisson’s ratio,  ν, and ferrite lamellae spacing, d, similar to [76,77] : 
𝜎𝑜𝑟~3𝜏=𝐺𝑏
𝜋(1−𝜐)𝑑ln𝑑
2𝜋𝑏        (Eq. 6) 
Strength levels of 2.8 GPa are achieved in nanopearlitic steels ( d = 15 -20 nm) deformed to εv = 14 by 
quasi -constrained HPT [45]. For this specific loading situation, deformation of the cementite is not 
required, as the overall compression of the sample is realized by localized slip in ferrite. However, this 
is also the weakest loading direction of a lamellar structure. When the la mellae are aligned 
perpendicular or parallel to the imposed load, the elastic response of the non -stoichiometric cementite 
enables strain hardening within the ferrite up to way higher strength levels of roughly 3.5 GPa. This is 
a fingerprint of nanocomposi tes [78], when the lamella r spacing below 50 nm [70] favors motion of 
dislocation half loops along the channels. For pearlitic grades in particular, the crucial role of the 
interface for plasticity was highlighted in MD -simulations [79–81], revealing that the interface type 
controls not only the type of emitted dislocations, how they contribute to slip transfer from fer rite to 
cementite, but also their accommodation in the interface governs strength and ductility. Recent 
approaches aim to unite confined layer slip  theory with the classical Hall -Petch concept by directly 
correlating the flow strength, τ, to the dislocatio n density stored in the interface, ρint, [82]  
𝜏=𝛼𝐺𝑏√𝜌𝑖𝑛𝑡
𝑑          (Eq. 7) 
Yet, it is interesting to note that the prevalence of a second harder phase might not be required to 
observe anisotropic deformation characteristics in nanolamellar structures. Despite the completely 
different interface  structure  in the HPT -deformed Ck10 ( i.e. carbon -enriched grain boundaries instead 
of continuous lamellar second phase), compression of an inclined structure yields also lower yield 
strength as compared to parallel and perpendicular loading  [54]. This implies that a second phase and 
its concomitant elastic response might not be necessary to achieve anisotropic strength levels, when 
the grain boundary provides sufficient resistance for dislocation absorption  or transmission. 
Nevertheless, the reduced strain hardening capacity as well as stronger tendency for strain localization 
in the nanolamellar Ck10 (30nm grain thickness, single phase, carbon -stabilized interfaces) and also in 
the nanograined pearlitic wir e (8 nm subgrain size, single phase, carbon -stabilized interfaces) in 
contrast to the nanolamellar pearlite (15 -20nm, ferrite -cementite interface) highlight the importance 
of a two -phase architecture to obtain ductility in ultrastrong structures [38].  
These results imply that a deeper understanding of mechanical properties of nanolamellar structures 
requires extended efforts to reveal basic dislocation -interface processes [67,83] . How plasticity 13 
 changes with the interface type (e.g. chemistry, misorientation, orientation r elationships in case of 
composites) determines nanomaterials ’ properties but is also a clue how to tailor grain architecture s 
in the absence of alloying elements  [57]. This will not only allow to design strong nanomaterials with 
exceptional toughness [27,84]  and ductility [38], but also to provide insights and solutions for steels 
that are prone to contact -fatigue issues like white etching layers during in servi ce.  
2.5 Conclusion  
SPD of nearly full y pearlitic, bainitic and martensitic steels is summarized in this paper  with a focus on 
HPT and wire drawing, because of their particular suitability  to deform materials of  high  hardening  
capacity . The following conclusion s can be drawn:   
» The strongest steels accessible to date are cold drawn pearlitic steels.  
» A similar structural evolution is obtained during HPT and wire drawing  of pearlitic steels . 
However, HPT requires significantly  larger equivalent strains to  achieve the same structural 
sizes and degrees of carbon -dissolution as compared to wire drawing.  
» The strength of the anvil materials and available  hydrostatic pressure is currently a major limit 
in HPT deformation of these steels.  
» SPD deformation of diffe rent steel types yields in a similar final architecture, which is 
elongated ferrite with carbon stabilizing its grain boundaries. Yet, for pearlitic steels elevated  
strain levels are necessary for a transition from a nanolamellar to a nanograined structure . 
» Similarities in anisotropic mechanical properties of SPD deformed pearlitic and martensitic 
steels highlight the importance of grain architecture for mechanical properties. However, the 
role of the interface in controlling deformation, strength and fract ure is similarly important 
and requires increasing scientific  attention in future studies.
