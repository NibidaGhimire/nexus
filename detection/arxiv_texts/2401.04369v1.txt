ABSTRACT   
Air pollution stands as the fourth leading cause of death globally. While extensive 
research has been conducted in this domain, most approaches rely on large datasets  
when it comes to  prediction. This limits  their applic ability in low -resource settings  
though more vulnerable . This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel machine 
learning approach for accurate air quality prediction using two months of air quality data. By leveraging the World Weather Repository, the meteorological, air pollutant, and Air Quality Index features from 197 capital cities were considered to predict air 
quality for the next day. The evaluation of several machine learning models  
demonstrates  the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm i n generating reliable 
predictions, particularly when applied to classification rather than regression , approach 
which enhances the model's generalizability by 42%, achieving a cross -validation score 
of 0.38 for regression and 0.89 for classification.  To instill confidence in the predictions, 
interpretable machine learning was considered . Finally , a cost estimation comparing 
the implementation of this solution in high -resource and low -resource settings is 
presented  including a tentative of technology licensi ng business model . This research 
highlights the potential for resource -limited countries to independently predict air 
quality while awaiting larger datasets to further refine their predictions.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Air pollution, which consists of harmful chemicals or particles in the air, poses a 
significant risk to the health of humans, animals, and plants, making it a complex issue  to tackle. As reported by ( “Nationale Geographic,” n.d.) -(Jillian Mackenzie 
& Jeff Turintine, 2023) , air pollution is now the world’s fourth- largest risk factor for 
early death, causing approximately 4.5 million deaths in 2019 due to exposure to outdoor air pollution and nearly 2.2 million deaths from indoor air pollution. This issue is particularly pre valent in large cities where emissions from various sources are 
concentrated. Moreover, climate change exacerbates the production of allergenic air pollutants, necessitating urgent action. Current mainstream research in this field is 2 
 primarily focused on understanding the health effects of air pollutants in the short and 
long term, especially on vulnerable populations. There is also a strong emphasis on the use of technology and big data to innovate in health science and enhance our understanding of the impact of air pollution. Monitoring air quality through observations and instrumentation, as well as modeling air quality, is considered crucial for making accurate projections, informing policy decisions, and guiding public health interventions and communica tion strategies. These strategies are being 
developed to effectively convey information about air pollution risks and the necessary interventions. In terms of technology use, machine learning is seen as a game- changer. By leveraging large datasets, it provides valuable insights from the 
wealth of information available, aiding in the development of robust responses to this hazard.  For instance, the research of (Méndez et al., 2023)  review machine learning 
algorithms applied in forecasting air quality fr om 2011 up to 2021 giving more insight 
on the features considered and the effectiveness of algorithms considered. Research of (Hasnain et al., 2022)  provided the result for the prediction of both short and long 
term of air quality in the Jiangsu province in Ch ina based on Prophet forecasting in 
forecasting the concentration of air pollutants. The estimation of PM2.5 levels in air was conducted in (Garg & Jindal, 2021)  where ARIMA, Facebook Prophet, 1D 
CNN and LSTM was compared. Their results showing the good performance of LSTM in terms of mean absolute percentage error. In (Kumar & Pande, 2023) , 
several machine learning algorithms were com pared to predict air quality in India 
showing the good performance of the XGBoost compared to the naïve Bayesian and support vector machine. In (Maduri et al., 2023) , the LightGBM, GBM and Random 
Forest were used to predict air quality using physical parameters and showing how they outperform deep learning algorithms in predicting the level of contaminations in the nearby area. According to (Yang et al., 2022) , meteorological features wield 
significant influence in forecasting air quality when integrated with air pollutant features. Utilizing explainable machine learning, specificall y the Shapley Additive 
Explanation method, the analysis reveals that enhancements in air quality are not 
solely achieved through the incorporation of meteorological features. Instead, the synergy between meteorological features and certain pollutant featur es proves pivotal, 
highlighting the importance of their interactive effects in achieving improved air quality. Current trend and challenges in the prediction of air quality is discussed in (Sokhi et al., 2022)  where the use of different source of information is considered as 
relevant to integrate the results of predictions wh ich is of a high importance for polic y 
makers.   
While a variety of promising solutions are being offered, countries with limited resources often struggle to analyze and implement their own tools to anticipate hazardous air quality even though they are more  exposed to these hazards compared 
to developed countries (Méndez et al., 2023) . There are several tools available 
globally that can provide such information, but in some regions, certain information is not accessible due to these limitations, making these countries more susceptible to this risk. Moreover, the use of machine learning often requires extensive datasets to be effective. However, countries with limited resources may lack the necessary resources or time to develop robust solutions to this ever -increasing hazard. This underscores 
the importance of the current study, which a ims to provide a straightforward yet 
effective method for achieving very short -term air quality projections using two 
months of data. By leveraging the unique information source provided by the world weather repository, a reliable projection of air quality using the air_quality_gb- defra- index
1 was accomplished, and the results were generalized to 
various countries. To bolster confidence in the results, an explainable machine learning approach was employed, incorporating the use of Local Interpretable Model -agnostic Explanation (LIME) (Zhu et al., 2023) , Explain like I am 5 
(Eli5) (Gezici & Tarhan, 2022) , and Partial Dependent Plots (PDPs) (Nduwayezu et

al., 2023) , thereby validating the results as authentic and worthy of consideration. The 
remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section two is dedicated to the 
methodology, while section three discusses the results. The conclusion is presented last. 
2. METHODOLOGY  
2.1. Dataset  
The World Weather Repository (NIDULA ELGIRIYEWITHANA, 2023) , a 
real-time dataset publicly accessible which offers over 40 environmental and 
weather -related features for approximately 197 capit al cities worldwide  was utilized . 
Data recording commenced on August 29, 2023, and continues to be regularly updated. The air quality index (AQI) to predict is the air_quality_gb- defra -index, 
developed in the United Kingdom. This index provides a range of values for air 
quality, from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating low air pollution and 10 indicating very high 
air pollution. The da taset had missing information (not missing values) for some 
countries, representing one percent of the entire dataset. To ensure robustness and reliability, the dataset was used as is. Three types of features were considered for prediction: meteorological (Temperature_celsius, Wind_mph, Wind_degree, Wind_direction, P ressure_mb, Precipitation_mm, Humidity, Cloud, 
Feels_like_celsius, Visibility, UV_index and gust_mph) 12 in total, the air quality index, one (1), and air pollutant Air_quality_Carbon_Monoxide, Air_quality_Nitrogen _Monoxide, Air_quality_Ozone, Air_quality_suylphur_dioxide, Air_quality_PM2.5, Air_quality_PM10, 6 in total, bri nging the number of features to 
19. Among the meteorological features, Feels_like_celsius (Rajat Lunawat, 2022)  
was added to evaluate the impact of subjectivity in the model performance. 
2.2. Exploratory data analysis  
Two overlapping clusters of countries for the period under consideration was observed, 
the first consist ing of 166 countries, while the second comprises 197 cou ntries. The 
distinction between the m resides in the fact that both the meteorological and AQI 
indices are higher in the second cluster compared to the first, which represent days with 
more extreme weather conditions compared to the first cluster. These conditions include higher temperatures, stronger winds, more precipitation, etc. Conversely, the lower levels of air pollutant features in the second cluster indicate better air quality 
compared to the first cluster. This suggests that the second cluster repr esents days with 
cleaner air. Consequently, all capital cities have experienced varying degrees of poor air quality, even those that have demonstrated a very good AQI during this period. In this study, these cities are categorized as ‘differences’, totalin g 31 in number . Fig 1 and 
Table 1 illustrate this . 
            Fig 1: AQI by cluster  
 Table 1: AQI frequency by cluster

AQI 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
Cluster 1  2018  1144  554 188 148 101 73 66 44 353 
Cluster 1  5338  1025  424 125 107 61 36 50 38 382 
Differenc es 1528  172 68 20 14 9 3 4 4 73 
 
Based on these, there is a higher number of good air quality compared to poor ones. 
However, the high occurrence of AQI equal to 10 highlights on the high probability to have extreme air quality compared to other values (b etween 4 and 9), providing a 
ground to understand the relevance of preparedness of to face this hazard which tends to increase overtime. Yet there is an interaction among those features, however, a correlation analysis shows that there is no correlation am ong the category of features 
(Fig 2)  
              Fig 2: Correlation table  
 
There is a strong correlation among some air pollutant features to the AQI 
air_quality_PM2(0.94), air_quality_PM10 (0.92) and air_quality_carbon_monoxyde 
(0.84), while others are  lowly correlated [air_quality_ozone ( -0.068), 
air_quality_Nitrogen_dioxyde (0.57) and air_quality_sulfur_dioxyde (0.3)] , but not 
with AQI and meteorological feature.  
2.3. Machine learning algorithms considered  
Several regressors and Classifiers were considered  based on their good performance 
in similar cases. These regressors were utilized: Linear Regression (Huang, 2023) , 
Ridge (Singh et al., 2023) , Decision Tree Regressor (Luo et al., 2021) , Random Forest 
Regressor(El Mrabet et al., 2022) , XGBoost Regressor (Patel et al., 2022) , Light 
GBM Regressor(Khawaja et al., 2023) , and Support Vector Regressor (Khawaja et 
al., 2023) . For classification, the classifiers used were: Logistic 
Regression (Wichitaksorn et al., 2023) , Random Forest Classifier (Schonlau & Zou, 
2020) , Decision Tree Classifier (Charbuty & Abdulazeez, 2021) , KNeighbors 
Classifier (Alkaaf et al., 2020) , XGBoost Classifier (Swathi & Kodukula, 2022) , 
Light GBM Classifier (Naim et al., 2022)  and (Alam et al., 2020) . This makes a total 
of 14 algorithms. 
2.4. Metrics  
Our approach to evaluating each algorithm involved two rounds of metric as sessments. 
The initial round was designed to assess the algorithm’s performance on future or 
unseen data for projection purposes. Following the selection of the most effective algorithm, the second round was conducted to evaluate its performance on the tra ining 
data. For regression tasks, the first round of metrics included the Mean Squared Error(Hodson et al., 2021) , R squared(Karch, 2020) , Cross-Validation Score (Yates et 
al., 2023)  using 5 folds, and Residuals (Zhang et al., 2018) . The second round 5 
 considered the normalized mean squared error (Handel, 2018) (nRMSE), with a 
threshold below 10 percent for  each country to be deemed as a satisfactory prediction. 
For classification tasks, the first- round metrics included the Cross -Validation Score 
(Yates et al., 2023)  using 5 folds, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (AMAN 
KHARWAL, n.d.) . The second round utilized the (Chicco & Jurman, 2020) , 
Classification Report (AMAN KHARWAL, n.d.) , and Confusion Matrix (Heydarian et 
al., 2022) . Given that the primary focus of our work is on projection, the 
Cross -Validation Score (Yates et al., 2 023) serves as a particularly useful metric in 
determining which algorithm is likely to perform better on unseen data. This 
comprehensive evaluation process ensures a robust assessment of each model’s performance.  
2.5. Explainable Machine learning 
To enhance t rust in prediction provided by the algorithm, three popular but powerful 
interpretability tools were employed, namely, the LIME for instance -based 
interpretation, ELI5 to visualize the contribution in terms of weights of each feature to the prediction, the reby offering a comprehensive view of the model’s performance 
and lastly, PDPs to visualize the pattern of contribution of each variable to the prediction of the target.  
2.6. Research design  
The dataset was prepared for one -day projection by grouping information by country 
either for regression and or classification task. This preparation excluded the last information of each group (information of 2023- 10-30) to be used as scenario for 
projection of the next day (2023- 10-31). For the classification approach, the  Air 
Quality Index (AQI) was grouped according to the categories present in the dataset before grouping information by country and preparing data for a time series 
classification. This p rocess ensures that the data is appropriately structured for both 
regression and classification tasks.  The prepared data was subsequently utilized to train 
the considered regressors and classifiers, with each model’s performance being evaluated accordingly. The model that demonstrated a good cross -validation score and 
performed well on other metrics was selected to generate a scenario for projecting the next day’s air quality. To assess the model’s performance, a country from among the low-resource countrie s was chosen, and the information for the last day was withheld. 
The r emaining information was then fed into the model to predict its value. Given that 
the data used for prediction, minus the last day’s information, will yield a result for the hidden day, this hidden day’s information is later used as a scenario to predict t he next 
non-existent day. Despite the inherent uncertainty of climate, this approach allows for a 
certain level of confidence to be built in the model’s performance. Lastly, the 
explaina ble machine learning components were implemented to enhance confidence  in 
the prediction results. This was done before comparing the two approaches (regression and classification) to determine which one provides the highest level of confidence for rapid implementation. Thanks to this design, one can leverage these models and place 
trust in the outcomes they provide. The result of analysis and projections are available 
on my GitHub

The two T ables  illustrate the super ior performance of the Random Forest algorithm. O n 
the regression approach, the LGBM model provided the best cross -validation score 
(0.39). However, in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE) (0.02) and coefficient of 
variation (0.65), it was unable to surpass t he performance of the Random Forest model 
(0.0067 and 0.91 respectively). The Decision Tree model, on the other hand, was found to overfit the data.  In the classification task, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and 
the Random Forest model both achieved t he highest cross -validation score (0.89). 
However, considering other metrics, the Random Forest model outperformed the SVC, making it the most suitable model for both cases despite a slight risk of overfitting, as indicated by the residuals ( -0.004).  
3.2. Model  selection  
In the second round of evaluation using the best model, the average nRMSE on the 
trained data was 0.089, and the mean residuals were 0.03. The number of capital cities 
having a nRMSE above the threshold of 10% was 73, with values ranging between  11 
and 32 percent. This represents 37% of the total capital cities. For the classification task, despite the imbalanced classes, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient was 1.0,  
suggesting a perfect classification. T he classification report and confusion met rics 
illustrates this result in T able 4.

A 42% improvement in generalizability was observed when using classification over 
regression, the cross -validation sc ore being respectively for regression and 
classification 0.38 | 0.89. This result suggests that the classification approach using Random Forest model is more suitable for this case. Actually, The, through its multiple decision trees constructed during trai ning using a process known as bootstrap 
aggregating or bagging, this model was able to better predict the mode of the class (which is the c lass itself) or the mean prediction for regression, of the individual trees. 
This was achieved while maintaining a good balance between bias and variance, which is crucial to prevent overfitting or underfitting. An average nRMSE above 10 indicates a significant degree of inaccuracy in the predictive model. This inaccuracy could potentially lead to a lack of preparedness for exposure to substandard air quality, a situation that poses a substantial health risk. Indeed, when it value is below 10, this 
indicate s that there could me error but in the range of 1 to 2 units which is actually 
acceptable since not far from the real ity. Such prediction will improve preparedness 
and have the potential to mitigate the impact of poor air quality. When this value is above 10, the range of error increases largely making such approach not suitable for real case application.  Traditionally, regression models have been employed to predict 
continuous air quality values. However, the study demonstrates that classification models c an outperform regression models in this context, achieving a better result. 
This improvement in performance suggests that classification models could be a more effective approach for short -term air quality forecasting in resource -constrained 
settings . Indeed, the use of classification models offers several advantages over 
regression models. First, classification models a re generally simpler to interpret, 
which can be beneficial when working with limited data. Second, classification models are less sensitive  to outliers and noise, which can be common in air quality 
data. Finally, classification models can be more computati onally efficient, which can 
be important when working with limited resources . 
3.3. Case study  
The Democratic Republic of Congo which is among the low resource country was considered. According to the dataset, for each category, the number of instances observed were: 0 = 2, 1 = 53, 2 = 7, 3 = 1.  It is evident that the Air Quality Index 
(AQI) in Kinshasa is typically moderate, although there was an instance when it reached a very high level. By utilizing the data from October 28 and 29, 2023, to predict subsequent values, the models accurately predicted the AQI for October 29, 2023. This confirms that the model is well -trained and capable of providing a 
projection for October 30, 2023. The same methodology was applied for classification. The time series plot of th ese results, provided in the Fig 3, offers a better visual of the 
situation  8

Fig 3: Projection using classification (a) and regression (b)  
 
The projected values for classification ( b) are 1 for both dates. For regression ( a), the 
value is 3.28 for October 29, 2023, which matches the actual value for that date, and 
3.61 for October 30, 2023, which is the projected value. Therefore, both results fall within the same category of moderate AQI. Th is indicates that the model could 
accurately predict the AQI category for these dates

 The best model considered on regression provided a strong contribution of the AQI 
followed by air pollutant features while the visibility on the other hand contributed the least. Among the meteorological features, gust_mph contributed the most followed by 
feels_like_celsius. Applied on classification, the category contribute d the most and the 
uv_index on the other hand contributed the least . The pollutants features contributed 
more after the category and among the meteorological features, the feels_like_cel sius 
contributed the most. 
3.4.3. Partial Dependents Plots  
 
On the regression approach, the temperature, wind_mph, wind_degree, wind direction, 
pressure_mb, precipitation_mm, humidity, feels_like_celsius indicate that both low 
and high values of the feature lead to high values of the predicted outcome. The AQI, air_quality_PM10, precipitation shows a rising trend meaning the positive correlation between them to the target. For the remai ning variable, the trend is not well defined, 
sometimes decreasing, increasing and varying in different directions, meaning a 
comple x and non -linear relationship to the target. On classification, each class depicted 
a different dependence. For classes I an d 3, the temperature, wind_mph, wind_degree, 
humidity, feels_like_celsius, gust_mph, air_quality_PM10 shows both low and high 
values of the feature lead to a high probability of a certain class, while medium values 
of the feature lead to a low probability of that class. The remaining features  start high 
and then decrease, remaining low over time, suggests that higher values of the feat ure 
are associated with a lower probability of predicting a certain class, indicating a 
possible negative effect of the feat ure to the predicted class. These features show a 
U-shaped relationship with the predicted class suggesting that extreme conditions 
(either low or high) of these weather factors are associated with the occurrence of the 
predicted class. The remaining featu res indicate a possible negative effect of these 
features on the predicted class. In other words, as these features increase, the li kelihood 
of the predicted class decreases.   For the class 2, the 'temperature_celsius', 
'wind_mph', 'wind_degree', 'wind_dir ection', 'pressure_mb', ‘humidity’, 
'feels_like_celsius', 'gust_mph’ suggests  that both low and high values of the feature 
lead to a low probability of a certain class, while medium values of the feature lead to a 
high probability of that class. The other features depict a positive correlation to the 
target. The inverted U -shaped relationship with the predicted class suggests that 
moderate conditions of these weather factors are associated with the occurrence of the 
predicted class. For the other features, they show an increasing trend over time 
indicating a possible positive effect of these features on the predicted class. In other words, as these features increase, the likelihood of the predicted class increases. Finally for the class 3, the 'temperature_celsius', 'wind_degree', 'humidity', indicate a possibl e 
negative effect on the predicted class. 'gust_mph', 'air_quality_Carbon_Monoxide' suggests that as the value of the feature increases, the probability of a certain class (as predicted by the model) de creases. This mean that the features have a negative 
correlation with the predicted class. The higher values of the feature make the predicted 
class less likely. Others depict a nonlinear relationship to the target class meaning to 
have a complex relations hip to the target. the influence of each feature on th e target 
variable can fluctuate, depending on the specific aim of the prediction being either regression or classification case. Despite the utilization of diverse methodologies, it 
was discerned that t he Air Quality Index (AQI) feature predominantly impacts the 
prediction for the subsequent day. This is followed by the pollutant index and 11 
 meteorological features, with the ‘feels like’ temperature demonstrating a particularly 
significant impact in compar ison to other meteorological features. In the context of 
classification, the category assumes a substantial role in forecasting, succeeded by the AQI feature and pollutant features. Notably, the ‘feels like’ temperature once again exhibits a considerable c ontribution, surpassing other meteorological features. This 
highlights the critical role of the perceived temperature in both regression and 
classification tasks within this context. The integration of the three types of features 
considered in this study, which includes the ‘feels like’ temperature within the  
meteorological features, underscores the significant role of subjective environmental conditions in the forecasting of AQI. This insight could prove instrumental in 
enhancing the  accuracy and reliabili ty of future air quality forecasts not only useful for 
understanding predictions but also for validating the  model and ensuring its proper 
functionality. 
3.5. Estimates on resource settings  
The cost of building a machine learning -based solution can vary signifi cantly 
depending on the specific requirements and resources available (Jon Reilly & , 2023) . 
However, in general, it is more expensive to develop and deploy such solutions in 
high- resource settings than in low -resource settings. High -resource  settings  typically 
have access to a wider range of resources, including the abundance of data from various 
source, the availability of computational resources and human talents (ITRex, 2023) . As 
a result, developi ng and deploying such  solutions in high- resource settings may involve 
costs associated to each of the above- mentioned aspects. Low-resource  settings  may 
have limited access to these resources, which can lead to lower upfront costs but may 
also affect the accuracy and scalability of the solution. In such settings, consider using open- source tools, cloud computing services, and collaborative approaches to reduce 
costs and maximize resource utilization (webfx.com, 2023) . Based on the experts point 
of vue, it is quite diffic ult to provide a provide a fixed price for such solution but only 
an estimate since considering the specificity of each case. Table 6, provide an estimate for each setting.

Estimation provided in Table 7 are a compilation of several sources  and m ostly 
consider the United States average hour . Considering the different average hours, an 
estimation of low resource settings followed the same path. Based on these , Table 8 
presents  a comparison of the cost estimates for building air quality prediction s olutions 
in high- resource and low -resource settings:  12 
  
Table 8: Comparison of cost estimation between high resource and low resource setting  
Category  High -Resource Setting  Low-Resource Setting  
Data acquisition and preparation  $ 10.000 ~ $100.000  $1.000 ~$1 0.000  
Model development and training  $100.000 ~ $1.000.000  $10.000 ~ $100.000  
Model Deployment and maintenance  $5.000 ~ $15.000  $1.000 ~ $10.000  
Unexpected costs (10% of total)  $11.500 ~ $111.500  $1.200 ~ $12.000  
Total estimate  $126.500 ~ $1. 226.500 $13.200 ~ $1 32.000 
This estimate  shows that cost of implementation of such solution is around ten times 
more in high resource  settings com pared to low resource  settings. However,  the 
market growth in some of those countries represent a unique opportunity to build 
promising business. C onsidering the case of the Democratic Republic  of Congo, the 
telecom market size is growing. Valued in 2022 at $1.6 billion, it is expected to gro w 
at a CAGR of more than 21% considering the forecast period from 2022 to 2027. This 
represents a huge growth in vue of the population size(Global Data, 2023) .

Copyright  50 100 150

Taking into account the varying costs associated with intellectual property protection  
presented in Table 9 , the average licensing agreement cost of around $92, and the 
research and development investment which ranges between 3% to 6% of revenue, 
coupled with licensing fees that fluctuate betw een 0.1% and 25%, the construction of 
such a solution presents a promising opportunity (Simon Kemp, 2023a, 2023b) . This 
venture could yield significant benefits for all stakeholders involved. For investors, it offers a potentially lucrative return on investment given the substantial market demand for  reliable air quality prediction tools. For the host country, it provides a 
valuable tool that can help safeguard public health and improve the quality of life for its citizens.  Moreover, the societal implications are profound. Access to reliable air 
quali ty information, regardless of location, empowers individuals to make informed 
decisions about their health and well -being. It also raises public awareness about 
environmental issues and can drive policy changes towards more sustainable practices . 
4. Conclusio n  
The prediction of air quality has become a topic of high interest in recent times, 
considering its significant impact on society. This study provides a robust approach that could be utilized by countries with limited resources to develop their own proje ction tools  inclu ding the possibility to take advantage of this to run a lucrative 
business  with costs estimations . By combining limited data with the mature 
technology of machine learning, reliable projections can be made. To enhance trust in this approac h, an explainable machine learning method was proposed, providing 
convincing evidence of the reliability of the obtained results. While these results are promising, there are some limitations to this study. The locations considered are only the capital cit ies. Although this gives a broad idea of the level of pollution, as there 
are often more people and activities in capital cities, it does not represent the pollution level of the entire country. In some cases, industrial regions could be more pollutant than the capital. Therefore, these results should be considered as representing the level 
of pollution only for the specified locations. Furthermore, in the set of features, meteorological, AQI, and pollutant features have been considered based on existing 13 
 research. However, to deepen our understanding of the topic, it could be relevant to 
consider economic factors and human activity factors. These factors could be based 
on the time of exposure to the sun and the moon, as some activities with the potential to pollute air quality are strongly connected to these phases. Our results unfold the 
acknowledged capability of machine learning to provide reliable projections even with limited data but having a good level of granularity. Despite the limitations, this study marks a significant step forward in the use of machine learning for air quality prediction, particularly in resource -limited settings. Future research could build upon 
these findings by incorporating more diverse data and refining the machine learning models used
