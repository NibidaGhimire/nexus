Abstract  
The ground state search of the Ising model can be used to solve many combinatorial 
optimization problems.  Under the current computer architecture, an Ising ground state search 
algorithm suitable for hardware computing is necessary for solving practical problems.  
Inspired by  the potential energy conversion of springs , we propose  a point  convolution al 
neural  network  algorithm  for ground state search  based on spring  vibration model , called  
Spring -Ising Algorithm . Spring -Ising Algorithm regard s the spin as a moving mass point 
connected to a spring  and establish the equation of motion  for all spins.  Spring -Ising 
Algorithm  can be mapped on the GPU or AI ch ips through the basic structure of the neural 
network for fast and efficient parallel computing.  The algorithm has very productive results 
for solving the Ising model and has been test  in the recognized test benchmark  K2000. The 
algorithm introduces the concept of dynamic equilibrium to achieve a more detailed local 
search by dynamically adjusting the weight of the Ising model in the spring oscillation model.  
Finally, there is the simple hardware test speed evaluation. Spring -Ising Algorith m can provide 
the possibility to calculate the Ising model on a chip which  focuse s on accelerating neural 
network calculations.  
Introduction  
Combinatorial optimization problems, a subfield of optimization  with discrete variables,  
are ubiquitous  in many fie lds of research . In many  cases , we can find a mapping to the 
decision form of the Ising model with a polynomial number of steps  for the NP C (Non-
deterministic Polynomial  Complete)  problem [1], [2], [3], [4]. Therefore, many optimization 
problems can be formulated as Ising models to find the ground state , or the lowest energy  
 2 / 15 
 configuration . So that, solving the Ising model becomes a general method for solving many 
NP problems, like partitioning problems [2], linear programming [1], [3], [5], inequality 
problems [6], coloring problems [2], [7] and so on. However, the Ising model is known to be  
NP-hard ( Non-deterministic Polynomial  Hard)  problem [8]. So, it is difficult but important to 
find the ground state of the Ising model quickly and accurately.  
The Ising model is mainly used in statistical physics and scientific computing.  In statistical 
physics, the Ising model is widely used to study the phase transition phenomenon  [9], [10], 
[11]. In scientific computing, the actual combinatorial optimization problem is mapped to the 
Ising model for finding the ground  state in the N spins state space  [12], [13], [14]. With N 
spins, there are 2N spin state to search  the global minimum of the energy  state, whic h is a 
great challenge  for using conventional computing  [15]. Special -purpose  hardware devices for 
the ground state search, known as Ising machines, have recently a ttracted attention because 
of their potential to substantially  speed up the solution of optimization problems  [16]. Various 
schemes have been proposed and demonstrated  for the Ising model , including quantum 
annealers  [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], coherent Ising machine  [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], 
[29], [30], [31] and so on . Limited by current technology , the above methods have difficulties 
such as large -scale expansion and complicated parameter configuration . Quantum computer 
is expected to solve exponential combinatorial optimization problems, but related work is still 
in its infancy  [32]. 
The CMOS  implementation s [16], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37] are easy to integrate and 
expand, which means that it is a more suitable strategy for mapping and solving large -scale 
practical Ising model problem . In application, CMOS Ising machine has adv antages such as 
tiny size, flexible expansion , high integration , low system power consumption  and so on  [36]. 
Most CMOS chips are based on non -fully connected  structures , like lattice graph [15], [33], 
[35], [36], king graph [34], [38], [39], [40], and Hexagonally graph  [41]. All-to-all connected 
Ising models are more practical value than sparse ones, but c ommunication and 
synchronization  between the spins degrade the speed performance in CMOS [16]. As the 
result of that , the spin scale of a CMOS chip based on a n all-to-all connected topology desig n 
is very limited.  The non -uniform design limits the popularization of CMOS  chips and increases 
the design cost of ASIC  for Ising model . 
AI (Artificial Intelligence ) chips have numerous computing resources , which are used for 
training and Inference of vari ous AI algorithms . and are important available resources for 
computing large -scale problems.  At present, AI chips have solved many problems such as 
classification, detection, and tracking by virtue of their powerful computing power [42], [43]. 
Commercial AI chips have the characteristics of high energy efficiency, high paralle lism, and 
high scalability . These chips , which are optimized for communication and synchronization , 
have been used in a large number of large models.  The computing architecture of the AI chip 
sets the computing engine for the multiply accumulate  operation  and realizes the parallel 
computing through efficient scheduling, thereby reducing computing time and off -chip 
storage access  [44]. Using these computing hardware resources to solve the Ising model with 
numerous  parameters  is an extremely effective method since  we have not yet achieved 
quantum computer s.  
The paper is or ganized as follows. In this paper,  we propose a new algorithm , Spring -
Ising Algorithm , that  can solve the all-to-all connected Ising model directly on the AI chip .  
 3 / 15 
 Frist, we introduce how Spring -Ising Algorithm  inspired by spring vibrations can be used to 
find the ground state of the Ising model . Then, we design the algorithm as a network structure 
based on point convolution  and residual modules, which implements the solution iteration of 
the Ising model through  point convolution and residual modules . Through our method, the 
optimization problem is transformed into the general formula of AI chip s calculation by 
constructing the Ising model paradigm  and AI chip s accelerate Spring -Ising Algorithm for the 
ground state finding .  Finally , the network structure is demonstrated on AI chip  architecture  
from Ref . [45] to solve the Max -cut problem  and both numerical and a nalytical investigation 
are conducted . 
Result 
In this chapter, we propose  the physical prototype of Spring -Ising Algorithm  and how to 
apply  Lagrange's equations  to iterate spin states by symplectic method . Spring -Ising 
Algorithm  is inspired by physical phenomena , spring vibrations . The detail of physical 
prototype is introduced as follow.  
 
1. Spring  vibration  model  
The Ising model is defined as  follow:  
ùêª=‚àí ‚àë ùêΩùëñùëóùúéùëñùúéùëó‚àí 
1‚â§ùëñ<ùëó‚â§ùëÅ‚àë ‚Ñéùëñùúéùëñ 
1‚â§ùëñ‚â§ùëÅ (1) 
The discrete variable ùúéùëñ is the ùëñth Ising spin state such that ùúéùëó‚àà {‚àí1,+1}. In Pauli 
matrices , the variable ùúéùëñ assigns values {‚àí1,+1} to spin values {‚Üì,‚Üë} [17]. ùêΩùëñùëó denote s a 
coupling coefficient between the ùëñth and ùëóth spins and ‚Ñéùëñ is an external magnetic coefficient 
for the ùëñth spin. ùêª is the total energy of the Ising model and it tends to the lowest energy.  
Inspired by the steady -state analysis of multiple mass -spring system  in analytical 
mechanics, the ground state  research  method of the Ising model in this paper is designed.  In 
Ising model, the state  of the ùëñth spin ‚Üë(‚Üì) is encoded as a discrete variable corresponding to 
a value of +1(‚àí1). We regard the discrete variable as the continuous change of the mass 
point in the macroscopic position, which is defined as the generalized coordinate ùëûùëñ‚àà[‚àí1,1]. 
On this basis, the spring model i s designed by considering a mass point  connected at an ideal 
spring with no initial length  and the spring force on the mass point is always pointing to one 
point, called the origin point . As shown in  Fig. 1(a), the spring is fixed at  the origin point , and 
the other end  is the mass  point represent ing the state of spin . Since the initial length of the 
spring is zero, when the mass point moves away from the origin, it is pulled by the spring.  In 
this model, the mass point is above (below ) the origin to represent the spin ‚Üë(‚Üì), and the 
distance is represented as a degree of confidence.  According to the coupling coefficient and 
spin state, the Ising model produces a number of forces along a line along the ùëûùëñ axis. 
Therefore, the direction  of the resultant force is also on the  ùëûùëñ axis, as shown in Fig . 1(b).   
 4 / 15 
  
Fig 1. Spring vibration model  based on Ising model.  The red sphere represents the spin, and the arrow in it indicates the 
spin state. The four bright red spheres on the upper left represent the four spins mapped by the Ising model.  The green 
connection  line between the red spheres represents the coupling rel ationship . The fuzzy sphere in the gray dashed box 
represents the opposite spin  state of the blue dashed box.  The two dashed boxes are used to represent the same spin in 
two spin states, expressing the two particle positions of the spring model . Correspondingly, the gray part in the spring 
model is another spin state . (a) The spin of Ising model is mapping to the position of the mass point on the spring 
vibration model . Take the part in the blue dashed box as an example, the spin state is up, the mass point  is above the 
origin.  The blue dashed box vice versa . (b) The distance between the mass point and the origin point  is effect ed by the 
coupling relationship and the spring . 
In the model, while a  spin considered as a mass point is called  the target spin , the other 
spins are call ed the source spins providing external force to the target spins . The magnitude 
and direction of ùêπùëñ depend on the combined effect of multiple source spins but  have nothing 
to do with the state of the target spin . Fig. 2(a) gives a specific example, when the state of 
source spin is +1, if the coupling coefficient is positive , an upward force will be generated. 
The greater the coupling coefficient, the greater the force generated. In the same way,  if the 
coupling coefficient is negative , a downward force will be generated. When the coupling 
coefficient is zero, the source spin  provides no force. The superposition of all the forces 
provided by the source spin  is the force of the Ising model coupling relationship for the mass 
point ùëñ. When the state of origin spin is ‚àí1, the direction of the force is opposite, as shown in 
Fig. 2(b).  
 
Fig 2. The specific example  shows  that the coupling relationship between spins affects the external force received on the 
mass point . ùúéùëñ is the ùëñth spin which is regarded as  the target spin and ùúéùëó is the ùëóth spin which is regarded as  the source 
spin. The blue line between the spins means that the coupling relationship of the two spins is positive, the green line is 
negative . The force on the mass point  is the resultant force produced by the sum of all coupling relations.  (a) When the 
source spin ùúéùëñ is +1, the coupling relationship produces multiple forces on the mass  point ùëñ. (b) When the spin state ùúéùëñ is 
‚àí1, the direction of the force is opposite .  
 
 5 / 15 
 The generalized coordinate introduced by the model is a continuous variable, which 
means that the magnitude of the force is also affected by the absolute value of the 
generalized coordinate from the  source  spin. So, the source spin is changed to the source 
spin generalized coordinate: ùúéùëñ‚àà{‚àí1,1}‚Üíùëûùëñ‚àà[‚àí1,1]. When the absolute value of the 
generalized coordinates is greater, the spring potential energy contained in the spring 
vibration model is greater.  For the Ising model, th e greater  source spin has a greater overall 
influence on the system to the target spin  and vice versa . Therefore, the discrete Ising model 
energy in Eq.  (1) is set to the continuous Ising model energy in the spring vibration model . 
 
2. Ground state search method  
After establishing the spring vibration model, the following is how to use the model to 
find the ground state  of Ising model . This method regards the potential energy of the Ising 
model as the ordinary potential energy and converts the potential energy of the Ising model 
into the potential energ y of the spring and the kinetic energy of the system. The Ising model 
energy gradually decreases and transforms into the potential energy of the spring.  Then, due 
to the constraints of generalized coordinates and generalized velocity , the energy originally  
converted into spring potential energy, continuous Ising model energy and kinetic energy is 
absorbed by the inelastic wall.  The energy of the whole system gradually decreases and thus 
converges to the spring potential energy and the energy of the Ising mo del near the ground 
state . 
According to the various constraints of this system, the Lagrangian equation is 
constructed as follows:  
ùêø(ùëûùëñ,ùëûùëñÃá,ùë°)=‚àëùëöùëûùëñÃá2 
ùëñ‚àí‚àë1
2ùëò(ùëûùëñ‚àíùëû0)2 
ùëñ‚àíùúÅùêªùêºùë†ùëñùëõùëî (ùíí) (2) 
Where ùëö is the mass coefficient, ùëò is the elastic coefficient, and ùúÅ is the scaling coefficient 
of the Ising model energy. The three terms  of the mass  point  in Eq . (2) are the kinetic energy 
term, the spring potential energy term and the continuous Ising model energy term . In the 
spring vibration model, the generalized coordinates are independent of ùë°. It can be seen from 
the formula that the movement of  the mass point s is affected by the potential energy of the 
spring and the energy of the Ising model.  The movement of the mass points is manifested as 
a continuous vibration on the ideal springs.  From another perspective, it can be considered 
that when the spring is doin g simple harmonic motion, a set of external forces are applied 
from the outside. Affected by the coupling coefficient of the Ising model, the oscillation s of 
the mass points  are biased towards the lower  Ising model  energy.  
 
3. Symplectic method  
 Since the size of the Ising model depends on the number of spins, the solution scale is 
quite large. Therefore, it is very difficult to solve the Lagrangian equation  directly and 
accurately. In this paper, referring to the Hamiltonian and symplectic method  [46], the 
numerical iterative calculation of the spring vibration model is carried out.  The Hamiltonian  
describes the total energy of the system and can be used t o describe the system's dynamic 
behavior.  Symplectic method is numerical method used to solve Hamilton's equations  and it  
preserve s energy conservation  of the system .

 According to the definition, the generalized momentum ùëùùëñ is obtained as  ùúïùêøùúïùëûÃá‚ÅÑ =ùëöùëûùëñÃá. 
The Hamiltonian of the system is obtained by performing the Legendre transformation on the 
Lagrangian quantity:  
ùêª(ùëû,ùëù,ùë°)=‚àëùëûùëñÃáùëùùëñ
ùëñ‚àíùêø(ùëûùëñ,ùëûùëñÃá,ùë°)=‚àë1
2ùëûùëñÃáùëùùëñ
ùëñ+‚àë1
2ùëò(ùëûùëñ‚àíùëû0)2
ùëñ+ùúÅùêªùêºùë†ùëñùëõùëî (ùíí) (3) 
Get Hamilton's equation:  
ùëûùëñÃá=ùúïùêª
ùúïùëùùëñ 
ùëùùëñÃá=‚àíùúïùêª
ùúïùëûùëñ=‚àíùëò(ùëûùëñ‚àíùëû0)+ùúÅ‚àëùë§ùëñùëóùëûùëó
ùëó (4) 
Use the symplectic algorithm to solve the Hamiltonian system, and set the system origin 
to ùëû0: 
ùëûùëñ(ùë°ùëõ+1)=ùëûùëñ(ùë°ùëõ)+ŒîùëûùëñÃá(ùë°ùëõ)=ùëûùëñ(ùë°ùëõ)+Œî
ùëöùëùùëñ(ùë°ùëõ) 
ùëùùëñ(ùë°ùëõ+1)=ùëùùëñ(ùë°ùëõ)+ŒîùëùùëñÃá(ùë°ùëõ)=ùëùùëñ(ùë°ùëõ)‚àíŒîùëòùëûùëñ(ùë°ùëõ)+ùúÅŒî‚àëùêΩùëñùëóùëûùëó(ùë°ùëõ)
ùëó (5) 
Where ùë°ùëõ is the ùëõth iteration. It can be seen from the above formula that  ùëûùëñ(ùë°ùëõ) and 
ùëùùëñ(ùë°ùëõ) depend on the value of the previous state. With the iteration of the value, the energy 
is continuously converted . As the energy of the Ising model decreases, the solution is 
gradually approaching the ground state of the Ising model.  Dimensional issues are not 
considered in numerical calculations, so parameters can be combined.  The Eq. (5) is called 
the iterative formula of  Spring -Ising Algorithm . 
 
4. Point  convolutional neural network  
 In the iterative calculation of the algorithm, the most important calculation is 
multiplication  of ùêΩùëñùëó and ùëûùëñ(ùë°ùëõ). A method of iterative calculation us ing point convolution to 
replace the product of vector and matrix is proposed, so that the algorithm can be used in 
high-bandwidth computing chips, like GPU and AI chip.  Moreover, the point convolution is 
optimized in the hardware design to reuse the convolution kernel and reduce data access  to 
accelerate the computation in parallel . Fig. 3 shows an alternative way of turning the iterative 
equation into the neural network architecture  computation . ùëûùëñ(ùë°ùëõ) of a single test is assigned 
at fixed coordina te of the feature map, so the number of generalized coordinates and feature 
maps are the same.  The size of the point convolution kernel also depends on the coupling 
relationship matrix of the Ising model  so that  the number  of convolution kernel  is ùëõ, and the 
number of convolution kernel channels is ùëõ. The rest of the architecture is the addition module, 
which can be completed through the residual structure in the neural network and  is supported 
in mainstream AI chips.

the feature map affects the number of parallel tests for th e algorithm . Using a 2√ó2 feature map is four independent 
iterative calculations . The value of the feature map is the generalized coordinate value, and the point convolution kernel 
is the weight data of the Ising model.  The ùëû‚Ä≤ùëõ is the temporary variable . On the right is the entire point convolution 
network architecture . 
Discussion  
In this chapter, we show the experimental results based on the spring vibrati on model . 
Then we introduce how to implement the above algorithm through point convolution and 
residual network and  implement it on the CASSANN -v2 architecture.  
To demonstrate the effect of Eq . (1), the algorithm is tested on the K 2000 benchmark 
instance , which is a random undirected  graph with 2000 vertices and 1999000 edges [23]. The 
K2000 has been used many times  to solve  maximum -cut problems (MAX -CUT)  for Ising model 
comparison of performance  [23], [47], [48].  
 
1. Qualitative result  
When the kinetic energy is large enough, it can cross the local minimum value by the 
local oscillation ; but at the same time, if the kinetic energy is too large, it cannot stay in any 
minimum value. So that, the following constraints are added each time ùëûùëñ is updated:   
ùëûùëñ‚Üêùëì(ùëûùëñ)={‚àí‚àö2,
ùëûùëñ,
‚àö2, ùëûùëñ<‚àí‚àö2 
‚àí‚àö2‚â§ùëûùëñ‚â§‚àö2 
ùëûùëñ>‚àö2 (6) 
Where ùëì(‚àó) describes the boundaries of ùëûùëñ. For the spring to vibrate, the boundary is slightly 
than the original setting [‚àí1,1] so that set ùëûùëñ‚àà[‚àí‚àö2,‚àö2]. After combining the boundary 
conditions, the equation describes the motion law of the spin.  
The mass point vibration result of running the spring  vibration model algorithm  in 10000 
iterations is shown in Fig . 4. The benchmark  has 2000 spins, of which the first twenty are 
selected in the figure for visualization. In the early stage of the algorithm, because the mass 
points are initialized at origin and only given a small disturbance , the energy of the Ising 
model has a long -term decline process. It can be clearly seen in the figure that, the polylines 
are very dense, which means that the mass  points are oscillating violently. In this time, the 
energy of Ising model is also rapidly oscillating and declining. In the middle, there are many 
 
 8 / 15 
 mass  points attached to the boundary gradually which have been at the lower energy point. 
Finally, only some mass  points are still oscillating to search for the optimal and the energy of 
the Ising model has tended to the ground state and the detai l of the energy change is shown 
in the inset of Fig. 4(a). Also, it can be seen that a few spin flips bring fluctuations of Ising 
energy.  
 
 
Fig 4. The spring vibration model algorithm on the K 2000 in 10000 iterations . The parameter configuration is as follows : k = 
0.5, Œ∂ = 0.8Œ∂0 -> 10Œ∂0, Œî = 0.2, m = 1.  (a) The energy change curve of  the Ising model.  The mass point  position s in 
Spring -Ising Algorithm  are initialized near the origin, so the energy starts from 0 and decreases rapidly.  Before 
Nstep=2000, the energy is descending in a violent shock. After that,  vibrate slightly to search for the energy minimum. (b) 
The mass point (the first twenty ) vibration . The very dense parts of the graph are the effect  of multiple mass points  
oscillations.  When the system completes the basic search, it tends to be stable . Most of the mass points  tend to be stable  
and only some of them perform local search  (like after N step=5000 ). 
 
2. Quantitative result  
It can be easily predicted that the potential energy  of the spring  is lost within the 
limitation of the boundary conditions  as time progresses.  Therefore, in the later stages of 
evolution, it is necessary to compensate for the lost energy.  In order to further search the 
ground state of Ising model accurately, Spring -Ising Algorithm  introduces the concept of 
energy dynamic balance to increase the energy proportion of Ising model and improve the 
 
 9 / 15 
 search efficiency.  To compensate for the energy loss, Spring -Ising Algorithm sets the ùúÅ as a 
linear variable ùúÅ(ùë°). In order to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, this variable is 
regarded as a constant in the calculation of the Lagrangian equation, which means that the 
time-varying effect in the Lagrange equation is not considered. Through further analysis and 
solution of this equation,  the ground state  finding  of the Ising model system is obtained.   
 
Fig 5. The effect of different Œ∂ on the average results  of K 2000. Œ∂0  is the base value. Œ∂0 = 0.05. The first and second sets of 
data (green curve and blue curve ) indicate that the current Œ∂ is fixed at 0.8 Œ∂0 or 10Œ∂0, respectively . The third  and fourth  set 
of data  (orange curve and red curve ) indicates that the Œ∂ is set from 0.8Œ∂0 to 10Œ∂0 with different step lengths . (Nstep = 200 
or 1000 ) 
 This test is based on the same  small disturbance  for initializing with different strategies 
of ùúÅ. As shown in Fig. 5, no matter what the value  of Œ∂ is fixed, the ground state search of the 
Ising model is easy to fall into a local optimum.  Although the larger ùúÅ quickly leads to better 
local results  (the blue line) , it is difficult to search further to get better results. By gradually 
changing the value of Œ∂, further searches can be performed after the spring model has entered 
local stabilit y. The red line and the orange line  can be clearly seen each time steady state is 
established and further searches . This result is very similar to sufficiently slow cooling in 
simulated annealing. When the step length is short  enough, better search results  can be 
obtained.  
The probability density function (CDF) is an important way to judge the performance of 
algorithms for solving Ising models . Fig 6. shows the cumulative distributions of the cut value 
of the K 2000. The algorithm is compared with the HdSB and HbSB algorithm  [47], and there are 
partial similarities under different modeling methods.  It shows that the spring  vibration model 
algorithm  within the specified number of steps can search for better cut value. The inset  shows 
that the algorithm can find the optimal value more effectively and the number of optimal 
solutions accounts for 2.9% of all solutions, which is on ly about 1.2% solved by HbSB and HdSB.

value . The red curve illustrate that the Spring -Ising Algorithm  has better suboptimal  distribution results  and more 
optimal values than HdSB  and HbSB  for the overall search results . 
 
3. Hardware implementation  
The test platform of this algorithm is a personal computer  (Intel 8700K and NVIDIA GTX 
2080ti)  and the AI architecture  (CNN accelerator ) developed  by Institute of Semiconductors , 
CAS [45]. By GTX 2080ti  testing in the PyTorch framework , when the size of Ising model is 
2000 and the number of tests is 1000, the calculation time is 9.95s/10000 steps , which means 
that a sample  time of 10,000 -step tests is 9.95ms.  But when the number of tests is 100, the 
time is 2.30ms/10000 steps.  The GPU has a shorter average single -sample test time at more 
massive tests . The average power consumption of the 2080Ti is 60 .6W. By the AI architecture , 
the size of Ising model is 2000 and the number of tests is 49 (7√ó7 feature map) , the calculation 
time is 381.15ms/10000 steps, which means that a sample  time of 10,000 -step tests  is 7.78ms. 
The average power consumption of the CASSANN -v2 is lower than 10W. 
Methods  
1. Numerical iteration  
First, regard the spin of the Ising model as ùëû and the coupling coefficient weight as ùêΩ. 
The ground state search process of the Ising model is solved under the mass point s oscillation 
process . Based on the spring vibration model, the vibration equation combined with the Ising 
model is constructed  and transformed into the following Hamiltonian .

According to the equations of motion, all mass points  are initialized near the origin, and 
then all mass points  are made to start moving under the joint action of the spring and the 
Ising model. According to the symplectic method, the positions of the mass  points  at each 
 
 11 / 15 
 time step are found.  The final spin state of the Ising model is obtained by tracking the mass 
points (numerical iteration).

ùëó (8) 
 Œî, ùëò and ùúÅ are independent adjustable variables . Then, Eq. (8) has the following 
constraints , like the perfectly  inelastic walls work  [47], ùëûùëñ‚àà[‚àí‚àö2,‚àö2],  ùëùùëñ‚àà[‚àí2,2]. ùúÅ(ùë°ùë†ùë°ùëíùëù) is 
a function linearly related to the number of iterations . For simple calculation, ùúÅ(ùë°ùë†ùë°ùëíùëù) is set as 
a piecewise constant function.  Eq. (8) iterates the specified number of times to get the result 
of the Ising model ground state.   
  
2. Hardware implementation  
 For an Ising model with ùëõ spins, generalized coordinates  ùëû are mapped to feature maps . 
The number of feature map pixels is the number of simultaneous iterations.  The coupling 
coefficient matrix of the Ising model is mapped to the point convolution kernel . Divide the ùêΩ 
into ùëõ 1√ó1 convolution kernels with ùëõ channels by row. Through the residual structure, the 
addition operation r equired in the algorithm is completed.  By continuously calling this 
network structure  (Fig. 3), the numerical calculation of ùëû and ùëù in the eq. (8) is updated . After 
an artificially set time step  or calculation time, the ùëû is sampled, which is the current low 
energy state of the Ising model.
