BI-ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AND BIHARMONIC MAPPINGS
MING-SHENG LIU AND SAMINATHAN PONNUSAMY
Abstract. In this paper, we establish three new versions of Landau-type the orems for
bounded bi-analytic functions of the form F(z) = ¯zG(z) +H(z), where GandHare
analytic in the unit disk |z|<1 withG(0) =H(0) = 0 and H′(0) = 1. In particular, two
of them are sharp while the other one either generalizes or improves the corresponding
result of Abdulhadi and Hajj. As consequences, several new sha rp versions of Landau-
type theorems for certain subclasses of bounded biharmonic mapp ings are proved.
1.Introduction and Preliminaries
One of the open problems in classical complex analysis is to obtain the p recise value
of the Bloch constant for analytic functions in the unit disk. In [5], C hen et al, and
Guathier considered the analogous problem of estimating the Bloch c onstant for planar
harmonic mappings. See also the work of Chen and Guathier [6] for pla nar harmonic
and pluriharmonic mappings. Motivated by the work from [5], this topic was dealt by a
number of authors with considerable improvements over the previo usly known Landau-
type theorems. These will be indicated later in this section. In this ar ticle, we consider
bi-analytic and biharmonic mappings and establish several new sharp versions of Landau-
type theorems for these two classes of mappings.
1.1.Deﬁnitions and Notations. A complex-valued function fis a bi-analytic (resp.
harmonic) on a domain D⊂Cif and only if fis twice continuously diﬀerentiable and
satisﬁes the bi-analytic equation f¯z¯z(z) = 0 (resp. Laplacian equation fzz(z) = 0) in D,
where we use the common notations for its formal derivatives:
fz=1
2(fx−ify),andfz=1
2(fx+ify), z=x+iy.
Note also that
∆f= 4fzz=∂2f
∂x2+∂2f
∂y2.
It is well-known that every bi-analytic function fin a simply connected domain Dhas
the representation (cf. [1])
f(z) = ¯zg(z)+h(z),

wheregandhare complex-valued analytic functions in D. Similarly, every harmonic
function fin a simply connected domain Dcan be written as f=h+gwithf(0) =h(0),
wheregandhare analytic on D(for details see [11]).
A complex-valued function Fis said to be biharmonic on a domain D⊂Cif and
only ifFis four times continuously diﬀerentiable and satisﬁes the biharmonic e quation
∆(∆f) = 0 in D. It is well-known (cf. [3]) that a biharmonic mapping Fin a simply
connected domain Dhas the following representation:
F(z) =|z|2G(z)+H(z),
whereGandHare harmonic in D.
A domain D⊂Cis said to be starlike if and only if the line segment [0 ,w] joining the
origin 0 to every other point w∈Dlies entirely in D.
Deﬁnition 1. (cf. [23, 24, 25]) A continuously diﬀerentiable function FonDis said to
be fully starlike in Dif it is sense-preserving, F(0) = 0,F(z)/\e}atio\slash= 0 inD\{0}and the curve
F(reit) is starlike with respect to the origin for each r∈(0,1). The last condition is same
as saying that
∂argF(reit)
∂t= Re/parenleftbiggzFz(z)−¯zF¯z(z)
F(z)/parenrightbigg
>0
for allz=reitandr∈(0,1).
For a complex-valued function finD, its Jacobian Jf(z) is given by Jf(z) =|fz(z)|2−
|fz(z)|2. We say that a harmonic mapping fis locally univalent and sense-preserving if
and only if its Jacobian Jf(z)>0 forz∈D(cf. [16]). For continuously diﬀerentiable
function f, let
Λf(z) =|fz(z)|+|fz(z)|andλf(z) =/vextendsingle/vextendsingle|fz(z)|−|fz(z)|/vextendsingle/vextendsingle.
Throughout Dr={z∈C:|z|< r}denotes the open disk about the origin so that
D:=D1is the unit disk. Forthe convenience of the reader, let us ﬁx some ba sic notations.

Deﬁnition 2. A function fin a family is said to belong to S(r;R)if it is univalent in
Drand the range f(Dr)contains a univalent disk DR.
1.2.Landau and Bloch theorems. The classical theorem of Landau states that if
f∈ BM∩ Afor some M >1, thenf∈ S(r;R) withr= 1/(M+√
M2−1) and
R=Mr2. This result is sharp, with the extremal function f0(z) =Mz1−Mz
M−z.Landau-type theorems for bi-analytic functions and biharm onic mappings 3
The Bloch theorem asserts the existence of a positive constant nu mberbsuch that if
f∈ A1, thenf(D) contains a schlicht disk of radius b, that is, a disk of radius bwhich
is the univalent image of some subregion of the unit disk D. The supremum of all such
constants bis called the Bloch constant (see [5, 13]).
In 2000, under a suitable restriction, Chen et al. [5] ﬁrst establishe d two non-sharp
versions of Landau-type theorems for bounded harmonic mapping on the unit disk which
we now recall with the help of our notation.
Theorem A. ([5, Theorem 3]) Iff∈ BH0

r1=π2

wherem≈6.85is the minimum of the function (3−r2)/(r(1−r2))for0< r <1.

thenf∈ S(r2;r2/2), wherer2=π
4(1+Λ).
Theorems A and B are not sharp. Better estimates were given in [12] and this topic
was later dealt by a number of authors (cf. [6, 9, 7, 10, 14, 15, 18 , 20]). In 2008,
Abdulhadi and Muhanna established two versions of Landau-type t heorems for certain
bounded biharmonic mappings in [2]. For later developments on this top ic, we refer to
[8, 9, 17, 19, 22, 26]. In particular, sharp versions of Theorem B ha ve been established in
[15, 18, 20], and the corresponding sharp versions of Landau-typ e theorems for normalized
bounded biharmonic mappings have also been established in [21].
Theorem C. ([21, Theorem 3.1]) Suppose that Λ1≥0andΛ2>1. LetF∈BiHand
F(z) =|z|2G(z)+H(z), whereG,H∈ H0,λF(0) = 1,ΛG(z)≤Λ1andΛH(z)<Λ2for

This result is sharp.

However, the sharp version of Landau-type theorem for normaliz ed bounded harmonic
mappings or Theorem A for the case of the bound M >1 has not been established. In
2022, Abdulhadi and Hajj established the following non-sharp Land au-type theorem for
certain bounded bi-analytic functions.
Theorem E. [1]LetF∈BiA0andF(z) = ¯zG(z) +H(z), whereG,H∈ A ∩ B Mfor

Theorem E is not sharp too.
1.3.Two natural question on Landau-type theorem. From the discussion above,
a couple of natural questions arise.
Problem 1. Can we establish some sharp versions of Landau-type theorem s for certain
bounded bi-analytic functions?
Problem 2. Whether we can further generalize and/or improve Theorem E?
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present stateme nts of four theorems
out of which one of them improves Theorem E. In addition, we provide several sharp
versionsofLandau-typetheoremsforcertainboundedbi-analyt icfunctions, whichprovide
an aﬃrmative answer to Problems 1 and 2. In particular, as consequ ence, we also obtain
four sharp versions of Landau-type theorems for certain bound ed biharmonic mappings.
In Section 3, we state a couple of lemmas which are needed for the pr oofs of main results
in Section 4.
2.Statement of Main Results and Remarks
We ﬁrst establish the following sharp version of Landau-type theor em for certain sub-
class of bounded bi-analytic functions.
Theorem 1. Suppose that Λ1≥0andΛ2>1. LetF∈BiA0andF(z) = ¯zG(z)+H(z),
whereG∈ A0,H∈ A,|G′(z)| ≤Λ1and|H′(z)|<Λ2for allz∈D. ThenF∈ S(ρ1;σ1),

This result is sharp, with an extremal function given by F1(z).
For the case Λ 1≥0 and Λ 2= 1, we will prove the following sharp version of Landau-
type theorem for certain subclass of bounded bi-analytic function s.Landau-type theorems for bi-analytic functions and biharm onic mappings 5
Theorem 2. Suppose that Λ≥0. LetF∈BiA0andF(z) = ¯zG(z) +H(z), where
G∈ A0,H∈ A,|G′(z)| ≤Λ, and|H(z)|<1or|H′(z)| ≤1for allz∈D. Then
F∈ S(ρ2;σ2), where

andσ2=ρ2−Λρ2
2. This result is sharp.
Remark 1. Note that G∈ A0implies that G(z) =zG1(z) withG1(z) being analytic
inD. Thus the bi-analytic function F(z) = ¯zG(z) +H(z) reduces to the form F(z) =
|z|2G1(z)+H(z)whichisclearlyabiharmonicmappings. Hence, weconcludethefollowin g
corollaries from Theorems 1 and 2.
Corollary 1. Suppose that Λ1≥0andΛ2>1. LetF(z) =|z|2G(z) +H(z)belong to
BiH, whereG∈Hol(D)andH∈ A.
(1)If|G(z)+zG′(z)| ≤Λ1, and|H′(z)|<Λ2for allz∈D, thenF∈ S(ρ1;σ1)where
ρ1andσ1are given by (2.1)and(2.2), respectively. This result is sharp, with an
extremal function F1(z)given by (2.2).
(2)If|G(z) +zG′(z)| ≤Λ1, and|H(z)|<1or|H′(z)| ≤1for allz∈D, then
F∈ S(ρ2;σ2)whereρ2andσ2are as in Theorem 2. This result is sharp, with an
extremal function given by F2(z) = Λ1|z|2+z.
If we replace the condition “ |G(z) +zG′(z)| ≤Λ1for allz∈D” by the conditions
“G(0) = 0 and |G′(z)| ≤Λ1for allz∈D” in Corollary 1, then, by Theorems C and D,
we have the following sharp versions of Landau-type theorems for the special subclasses
of bounded biharmonic mappings.
Corollary 2. Suppose that Λ1≥0andΛ2>1. LetF(z) =|z|2G(z) +H(z)belong to
BiH, whereG∈Hol(D)andH∈ A.
(1)If|G′(z)| ≤Λ1, and|H′(z)|<Λ2for allz∈D, thenF∈ S(r3;R3), wherer3and
R3are as in Theorem C. This result is sharp, with an extremal fun ction given by
F0(z) = Λ2

.
(2)If|G′(z)| ≤Λ1, and|H(z)|<1or|H′(z)| ≤1for allz∈D, thenF∈ S(r4;R4),
wherer4andR4are as in Theorem D. This result is sharp. This result is sharp ,
with an extremal function given by F2(z) = Λ1|z|2+z.
Now we improve Theorem A by establishing the following results.
Theorem 3. LetF∈BiA0andF(z) = ¯zG(z) +H(z), whereG∈ BM1∩ AandH∈
BM2∩Afor some M1>0andM2>0. ThenF∈ S(ρ3;σ3), whereρ3is the unique root

Remark 2. If we set M1=M2= 1 in Theorem 3, then it is clear that G(z) =zand
H(z) =zby Schwarz lemma. Thus, ρ3=1
2andσ3=1
4are sharp, with an extremal
function F3(z) =|z|2+z. Moreover, if we set M1=M2=Min Theorem 3, then one can
easily gets an improved version of Theorem E.
Furthermore, as with Remark 1, we easily have the following.
Corollary 3. LetF(z) =|z|2G(z) +H(z)belong to BiH, whereG∈ BM1∩ Aand
H∈ BM2∩Afor some M1>0andM2>0. ThenF∈ S(ρ3;σ3), whereρ3andσ3are as
in Theorem 3.
Remark 3. Again, if M1=M2= 1, then we have ρ3=1
2andσ3=1
4with an extremal
function F3(z) =|z|2+z.
Finally, we improve Theorem 3 by establishing the following theorem.
Theorem 4. LetF∈BiA0andF(z) = ¯zG(z) +H(z), where0/\e}atio\slash≡G∈ BM1∩ Aand
H∈ BM2∩Afor some M1>0andM2>0. ThenFis sense-preserving, univalent and
fully starlike in the disk Dρ3, whereρ3is the unique root in (0,1)of Eq.(2.3).

This proves the univalency of Fin the disk Dρ1.
Next, we prove that F(Dρ1)⊇Dσ1, whereσ1is deﬁned by (2.2). First we note that
F(0) = 0, for z′∈∂Dρ1withw′=F(z′)∈F(∂Dρ1) and|w′|= min{|w|:w∈F(∂Dρ1)}.
By (4.1) and Lemma 1, we have that
|w′|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle¯z′G(z′)+H(z′)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≥ |H(z′)|−Λ1ρ2

Now, we prove the sharpness of ρ1andσ1. To this end, we consider the bi-analytic
functionF1(z)whichisgivenby(2.2). Itiseasytoverifythat F1(z)satisﬁesthehypothesis
of Theorem 1, and thus, we have that F1(z) is univalent in Dρ1, andF1(Dρ1)⊇Dσ1.
To show that the radius ρ1is sharp, we need to prove that F1(z) is not univalent in Dr
for eachr∈(ρ1,1]. In fact for the real diﬀerentiable function h0(x) given above, we have
h′
0(x) =2Λ1x2−Λ2(2Λ1+Λ2)x+Λ2
Λ2−x
which is continuous and strictly decreasing on [0 ,1] withh′
0(ρ1) = 0. It follows that
h′
0(x) = 0 for x∈[0,1] if and only if x=ρ1. Soh0(x) is strictly increasing on [0 ,ρ1) and
strictly decreasing on [ ρ1,1]. Since h0(0) = 0, there is a unique real ρ′
1∈(ρ1,1] such that
h0(ρ′

By the mean value theorem, there is a unique δ∈(0,ρ1) such that x2:=ρ1−δ∈(0,ρ1)
andh0(x1) =h0(x2).
Letz1=x1andz2=x2. Thenz1, z2∈Drwithz1/\e}atio\slash=z2and observe that
F1(z1) =F1(x1) =h0(x1) =h0(x2) =F1(z2).
HenceF1is not univalent in the disk Drfor each r∈(ρ2,1], and thus, the radius ρ1is
sharp.
Finally, note that F1(0) = 0 and picking up z′=ρ1∈∂Dρ1, by (2.2), (4.2) and (4.3),
we have
|F1(z′)−F1(0)|=|F1(ρ1)|=|h0(ρ1)|=h0(ρ1) =σ1.
Hence, the radius σ1of the schlicht disk is also sharp. /squareLandau-type theorems for bi-analytic functions and biharm onic mappings 11
4.2.Proof of Theorem 2. The assumption on H, namely, H∈ B1∩ A, clearly gives
thatH(z)≡zinD(by Schwarz’s lemma). Thus, Freduces to the form F(z) = ¯zG(z)+z.
Nowweprove Fisunivalentinthedisk Dρ1. Tothisend, forany z1,z2∈Dr(0< r < ρ 2)
withz1/\e}atio\slash=z2, by the condition G(0) = 0 and |G′(z)| ≤Λ for allz∈D, and (4.1), it follows
that|G(z)| ≤Λ|z|inD. Consequently,
|F(z1)−F(z2)| ≥ |z1−z2|−/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
[z1,z2]¯zG′(z)dz+G(z)d¯z/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
≥ |z1−z2|(1−2Λr)>0
which proves the univalency of Fin the disk Dρ2, whereρ2is given in the statement of
the theorem.
Noticing that F(0) = 0, for any z=ρ2eiθ∈∂Dρ2, we have
|F(z)|=|¯zG(z)+z| ≥ |z|−ρ1|G(z)| ≥ρ2−Λρ2
2=σ2.
Hence,F(Dρ2) contains a schlicht disk Dσ2.
Finally, for F2(z) = Λ|z|2+z, a direct computation veriﬁes that ρ2andσ2are sharp.
This completes the proof. /square

Next, we prove that F(Dρ3)⊇Dσ3, whereσ3is as in the statement. Indeed, note that
F(0) = 0 and for any z′∈∂Dρ3withw′=F(z′)∈F(∂Dρ3), it follows from (4.4) that
