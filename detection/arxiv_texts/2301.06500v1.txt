FACTORIZATION OF CERTAIN MACDONALD
LITTLEWOOD-RICHARDSON COEFFICIENTS
KONSTANTIN MATVEEV AND YUCHEN WEI
Abstract. We nd and prove a factorization formula for certain Macdonald Littlewood-
Richardson coecients c
(q;t). Namely, we consider the case that the Kostka number K;−
is 1. This settles a particular case of a more general conjecture of Richard Stanely, [St89]. This
conjecture proposes that a factorization formula exists whenever the corresponding regular
Littlewood-Richardson coecient c
is 1.

1.1.Preliminaries.
1.1.1. Macdonald functions. P=P(q;t)is a Macdonald symmetric function, [Mac99]. {P}
withranging over partitions is a basis of the algebra of symmetric functions over C(q;t).

interested in studying these structure constants c
(q;t), i.e. Macdonald Littlewood-Richardson
coecients.
1.1.2. Schur functions. Pforq=tbecomes the Schur function S, which doesn't depend on
q=t. Forn≥`()polynomial S(x1;x2;:::;xn)can be viewed as the character of the Schur

1.1.3. Littlewood-Richardson rule. c
counts the number of semistandard skew tableaux Tof
shape/slash.leftwith weight and additional property that w(T)is a lattice word. Here word w(T)is
obtained by reading symbols in Tfrom right to left in successive rows, starting with the top row.
A word of length Nin the symbols 1 ;2;:::;n is said to be a lattice word if for 1 ≤r≤Nand 1≤
i≤n−1, the number of occurrences of the symbol iin the rstrletters ofwis not less than the
number of occurrences of i+1. This is the celebrated Littlewood-Richardson rule, [LR34], [F97,
chapter 5], [Ste02]. c
also enumerates other families of combinatorial objects: Berenstein-
Zelevinsky patterns, [BZ92], Knutson-Tao honeycombs/puzzles/hives, [KT99], [KTW04], [B00],
Vakil checkergames, [V06].
1.1.4. Pieri formulas. For one-row =(r)or one-column =1rthe corresponding Macdonald
Littlewood-Richardson coecients are given explicitly by the Pieri formulas.

Richardson coeecients are positive for −1<q;t<1 and become 1 for q=t, the Schur case.
1.1.5. Formulas for Macdonald Littlewood-Richardson coecients. [S11] uses interpolation Mac-
donald polynomials to nd an expression for c
(q;t), [Y12] uses nonsymmetric Macdonald
polynomials and combinatorics of alcove walks to nd another formula. However, both ex-
pressions are very complex. We are interested in nding special cases when the corresponding
coecients easily factorize. More precisely, we are looking for triples of partitions (;;)such
thatc
(q;t)is a product of terms /parenleft.alt21−qatb+1

are such triples whenever /slash.leftis a vertical r-strip,(;(r);)are such triples whenever /slash.leftis a
horizontalr-strip. By commutativity, same holds for (1r;;)and((r);;).FACTORIZATION OF CERTAIN MACDONALD LITTLEWOOD-RICHARDSON COEFFICIENTS 3
1.1.6. Stanley's conjecture. Settingq=timplies that triples with factorization of this kind
must satisfy c
=1. Richard Stanley conjectured in [St89, Conjecture 8.5] that the converse
is also true. More precisely, his conjecture was for Jack functions which can be obtained
from Macdonald functions by setting q=tandt→1. But it transfers to the more general
Macdonald case in a straightforward way. As far as we know, the conjecture in general remains
open. Stanley also suggested that the factorization formula must belong to a specied nite
family. However, it remains unclear how in general to chose the correct element of this family.
[N16] proved Stanley's conjecture for the special case `();`();`()≤3. In this paper we
identify another family of special cases for which we can prove factorization.
1.2.Results.
1.2.1. Kostka numbers. The Kostka number Kfor a partition and a composition is
the number of semistandard Young tableaux of shape and weight . Suppose that =
(1;2;:::;n), where some of the i's might be zeros. `();`()≤n,=(1+1;2+2;:::;n+
n), where alli≥0 and∑n
i=1i=/divides.alt0/divides.alt0. We start with the following corollary of the Littlewood-
Richardson rule.
Proposition 1.2. c
≤Kwith equality, in particular, when /slash.leftis a horizontal strip.
See section 2 for the proof of proposition 1.2. Note that i−i+1≥`(′)for any 1 ≤i≤n−1
guarantees that /slash.leftis a horizontal strip. Thus for with large row gaps the Littlewood-
Richardson coecient turns into the corresponding Kostka number.
1.2.2. Unique semistandard tableaux. [BZ92] explicitly describes pairs (;)withK=1. We
prove a related result
Proposition 1.3. Given a semistandard tableau Twithnboxes, the following are equivalent:
(Cn):Tis unique of its shape and weight.
(C′
n):For any two columns in T, the later one is either obtained from the former by changing
at most one value, or is a subset of the former.

See section 2 for the proof of proposition 1.3.
1.2.3. Macdonald Littlewood-Richardson coecient as a rational function. LetXi∶=qit1−i.
Then the Pieri multiplicity  ′
/slash.leftcan be expressed as
/product.disp
1≤j<k≤n∶j=j; k=k+1Xk−Xjtq−1
Xk−Xj⋅Xk−Xjt−1
Xk−Xjq−1: (1.3)
Note that the denominator of (1.3) doesn't vanish for general q;tand any composition . If
is a partition, then the numerator of (1.3) for general q;tvanishes precisely when fails to be
a partition. Now we can express Pas a polynomial in er's and repeatedly use (1.3) to express
c
(q;t)as a rational function in X1;X2;:::;Xn. This approach breaks the symmetry between
and, but allows to study all 's at the same time by means of the same rational function.4 KONSTANTIN MATVEEV AND YUCHEN WEI
We originally encountered the folrmulas (1.4) below by studying such rational functions in
Mathematica .
1.2.4. Factorization formula. LetTbe a unique semistandard tableau with entries from 1 ;2;
:::;n . Call a triple (j;k;m)admissible if 1≤j<k≤n, and them-th column of Tcontains
kbut does not contain j. Denote by a(j;k;m)the number of columns of Tamong the rst
(m−1)columns that also contain k, but do not contain j. Denote by b(j;k;m)the number of
columns of Tamong the rst (m−1)columns that contain j, but do not contain k. Denote
by T(q;t)the -weight of the tableau Tas in the formula P(x)=∑T T(q;t)xT. Our main
result is the following.
Theorem 1.4. Suppose that K=1. LetTbe the corresponding unique semistandard tableau.
Then the Macdonald Littlewood-Richardson coecient c
(q;t)is given by

whereXi∶=qit1−i.
1.2.5. Example. IfTis a one-column tableau, it is always unique of its shape and weight. Then
a(j;k;1)=b(j;k;1)=0, so (1.4) becomes the vertical Pieri formula (1.3). If Tis a one-row
tableau, it is also always unique of its shape and weight. This case corresponds to the horizontal
Pieri-formula, see subsection 3.4 for more details. Here is an example that is not a Pieri formula.
Letn=3,=(3;2),1−1=2−2=1;3−3=3. The corresponding unique semistandard
tableau is shown on the left of Figure 1. The formula (1.4) in this case becomes
(1+q)(1−t)
1−qt⋅(X3−q−1tX2)(X3−t−1X2)
(X3−X2)(X3−q−1X2)⋅(X2−tX1)(X2−t−1X2)

(X3−q−1X1)(X3−q−2X1)⋅(X3−q−1tX2)(X3−t−1X2)
(X3−X2)(X3−q−1X2)
1.2.6. Connection with Stanley's conjecture. Let
U(a;l)=1−qa+1tl; L(a;l)=1−qatl+1
denote the upper hook length and the lower hook length, respectively. Let sdenote a box in
a partition, and let a(s)(respectively, l(s)) be the arm(respectively, leg) length at s. We show
that
Proposition 1.5. Under the assumption of Theorem 1.4, we have
/parenleft.alt4/product.disp
s∈L(a(s);l(s))/parenright.alt4⋅/parenleft.alt4/product.disp
s∈L(a(s);l(s))/parenright.alt4⋅/parenleft.alt4/product.disp
s∈U(a(s);l(s))/parenright.alt4⋅c
(q;t) (1.5)
is a polynomial in L;U, moreover, the number of factors in the form of Uequals the number of
factors in the form of L.
See section 4 for the proof of proposition 1.5.
Note that Stanley's conjecture is about the Jack polynomials and requires the weaker assump-
tion thatc
=1. However, the Jack case can be viewed as a specialization of the Macdonald
case by letting q=tandt→1. If we apply the L'H^ opital's rule in the limit of c
(t;t)as
t→1, and replace U(a;l)(respectively, L(a;l)) by(a+1)+l(respectively, (a)+l+1), then
we get the Stanley's conjecture.FACTORIZATION OF CERTAIN MACDONALD LITTLEWOOD-RICHARDSON COEFFICIENTS 5
The proof of proposition 1.5 follows directly from theorem 1.4. The idea is to rewrite factors
in 1.4 into the form of lower and upper hook lengths and cancel the repeated factors.

Note that the fractionU(2−4−1;1)
L(2−4−1;1)corresponds to a \ctitious ipper"(to be discussed in
section 4) in the sense that there is no box in the second row of with leg length one, however,
we can pair it with its reciprocalL(2−3−1;1)
U(2−3−1;1).
The fractionL(1−2;1)
U(1−2;1)correspond to a \ctitious ipper" since there is no box in the rst
row ofwith leg length one, however, we pair it with its reciprocalU(1−3−1;1)
L(1−3−1;1).
Likewise, the fractionU(1−4−1;2)
L(1−4−1;2)is a \ctitious ipper" since there is no box in the rst row
ofwith leg length two, however, we pair it with its reciprocalL(1−3−1;2)
U(1−3−1;2).
All the section 4 is devoted to showing that whenever we have a \ctitious ipper", it is
guaranteed to nd its reciprocal in the expression of c
(q;t). The way that we examine this
fact is by comparing for each xed triple of integers (i;j−1;j)such thati<j−1, the number
of \ctitious ippers" in the form ofU
Lwith leg length (j−i)−1(respectively,L
Uwith leg length

This picture demenstrates that all the potential \ctitious ippers" located in the i-th row with \c-

1.2.8. Proof outline of Proposition 1.3. We do induction on the total number nof boxes in a
given semistandard tableau T.
To show that (Cn)/Leftrightline⇒(C′
n), for arbitrary two columns in T, we identify seven dierent
cases characterized by the relative positions of the lowest boxes in these two columns as well as
the appearances of the largest integer lofTin these two columns. By the induction hypotheses,
we can quickly go through the rst ve cases.
When the sixth case happens, we use induction to argue that (C′
n)must hold, namely, [′
j]
is a subset of [′
i]in this particular case. It turns out that this further boils down to showing
that when′
i=′
j+1, we must have [′
j]=[′
i]/uni2216{l}for anyi<jsatisfying Case 6. Proceed by
proving by contradiction. Assume on the contrary that i=′
j+1 and[′
j]≠[′
i]/uni2216{l}for some
i<jin Case 6, then after doing a counterclockwise shift of a sequence of boxes(the notations
are dened in the proof):
(T(′
j−h;S);T(′
j−h+1;s);T(′
j−h+2;s);:::;T(′
i;s);T(′
i;s+1);:::;
T(′
i;m);T(′
j;S);T(′
j−1;S);:::;T(′
j−h+1;S))
we will get a new tableau. This contradicts (Cn).
It remains to show that Case 7 is impossible. After ruling out the simple case where T(′
i;i)>
T(′
j−1;j)we claim that doing a clockwise shift of the boxes:
(T(′
j−h+1;i);T(′
j−(h−1)+1;i);:::;T(′
j;i);T(′
j;j);T(′
j−1;j);:::;T(′
j−h+1;j))
yields a new tableau, contradicting (Cn).
To show that (C′
n)/Leftrightline⇒(Cn), we prove by contradiction. Assume that we have two distinct
tableaux with the same shape and weight, we rst show that the weights of each corresponding
vertical rectangular blocks must be the same. This implies that the positions of lare xed.
Then we observe that C′
n−/parallel.alt1L/parallel.alt1holds which implies that the rest of the tableaux are also the
same. This concludes the proof.
Suppose tableau Tis unique of its shape and weight. It is comprised of a sequence of
rectangular blocks of decreasing heights. Each of these blocks must also be unique of its shape
and weight by proposition 1.3. Consider such block of size k×m. Then proposition 1.3 implies
that weights of its columns are sets of size kand any two of these sets dier by at most one
element.

See section 3 for the proof of the proposition 1.6. Note that some rectangular blocks can be
both of the second kind and the third kind. One row tableau is either of the rst kind, or of
the second kind. The idea is to prove theorem 1.4 individually for rectangular blocks of each
kind and then put everything together with the help of induction. The main tool is vertical
Pieri formulas 1.1.

i]denote the set of boxes in the i-th
column of′. Since the column is lled with dierent integers, we identify the integers with
their corresponding boxes in the same column. For example, if lis an integer appeared in the
i-th column, we write l∈[′
i]. LetT(r;c)denote the box in the r-th row and the c-th column.)
Clearly, it is true if Thas only one box. Proceed by doing induction on the number of boxes
ofTand assume that it holds for all integers less than n.

Case 7
Let[′

the pictures above.
Case 1 :′
i=′
j,l∈[′
i],l∈[′
j]. By induction, [′
j]/uni2216{l}is obtained from [′
i]/uni2216{l}by changing
at most one value. It follows that the same is true for [′
i]and[′
j].
Case 2 :′
i=′
j,l∉[′
i],l∈[′
j]. By induction, [′
j]/uni2216{l}is a subset of [′
i]. It follows that
[′
j]is obtained from [′
i]by changing its unique element not in [′
j]/uni2216{l}tol.
Case 3 :′
i=′
j,l∉[′
i],l∉[′
j]. By induction, [′
j]is obtained from [′
i]by changing at most
one value.
Case 4 :′
i>′
j,l∈[′
i],l∈[′
j]. By induction, [′
j]/uni2216{l}is a subset of [′
i]/uni2216{l}. It follows
that[′
j]is a subset of [′
i].
Case 5 :′
i>′
j,l∉[′
i],l∉[′
j]. By induction, [′
j]is a subset of [′
i].
Case 6 :′
i>′
j,l∈[′
i],l∉[′
j]. If′
i>′
j+1, then by induction, [′
j]is a subset of [′
i]/uni2216{l}.
It follows that [′
j]is a subset of [′
i].
If′
i=′
j+1, then by induction, there are two possibilities: [′
j]=[′
i]/uni2216{l}or[′
j]is obtained
from[′
i]/uni2216{l}by changing one value. If [′
j]=[′
i]/uni2216{l}, then[′
j]is a subset of [′
i]. We show
that this is the only possibility.
Otherwise, suppose that ′
i=′
j+1 and[′

Tableau 2
It is clear that the above tableaux have the same shape and weight. Also, note that the
Tableau 1 restricted to the shape (8;7;7;7;7;1;0)satisesC′
8+7+7+7+7+1.
Leti=2,j=5, then′
i=6=′
j+1 and[′
2]/uni2216{7}≠[′
5]. Observe that moving the circled
integers (5;6;7;7;6)in Tableau 1 counterclockwise leads to Tableau 2.
To carry this out in general, let the s-th column be the leftest column of length ′
isuch that
T(′
i;s)=l. Let theS-th column be the rightest column of length ′
jsuch thatT(′
j;S)<l.
By our assumptions, both sandSexist. Moreover, s≤iandS≥j. Let them-th column be
the rightest column of length ′
i. So,i≤m<j.
IfT(′
j;s)<T(′
j;S), then moving the integers
(T(′
j;S);T(′
i;s)=
l;T(′
i;s+1)=
l;:::;T(′
i;m))=
l
in the tableau counterclockwise will generate a new tableau. One can easily check that we
are simply interchanging T(′
j;S)andT(′
i;s)=lin this case. To see that this gives us a
new tableau, it suces to show that T(′
i;s−1)≤T(′
j;S)ifs>1, asT(′
j;S+1)=lif
′
S+1=′
j, ensures the validity of replacing T(′
j;S)byl. By induction, the denition of S, and
T(′
j;s)<T(′
j;S), we have [′
S]/uni228A[′
s−1],[′
s]/uni2216{l}/uni228A[′
s−1]and Card ([′
S]∪([′
s]/uni2216{l}))≥′
i.
However, max {[′
S]∪([′
s]/uni2216{l})}=T(′
j;S). It follows that T(′
i;s−1)≤T(′
j;S).
In general, since [′
j]≠[′
i]/uni2216{l}, there must exist a smallest h∈{0;1;:::;′
j−1}such
thatT(′
j−h;s)<T(′
j−h;S). We have just shown that when h=0, doing the above
counterclockwise shifting leads to a new tableau. For h>0, we will show that moving the
integers:
(T(′
j−h;S);T(′
j−h+1;s);T(′
j−h+2;s);:::;T(′

T(′
i;m);T(′
j;S);T(′
j−1;S);:::;T(′

in the tableau counterclockwise leads to a new tableau.
Note that
{T(′
i;s);T(′
i;s+1);:::;T(′
i;m)}={l};10 KONSTANTIN MATVEEV AND YUCHEN WEI
it suces to show that the new tableau is weakly increasing from the S-th column to the
(S+1)-th column if there are more than Scolumns, and from the (s−1)-th column to the s-th
column ifs>1.
By induction, [′
S+1]/uni2216{l}/uni228A[′
S]if there are more than Scolumns. If ′
S+1<′
j−h, then
we are done. Otherwise, we claim that T(′
j−h′+1;S)≤T(′
j−h′;S+1)for all max {′
j−
′
S+1;1}≤h′≤h. Indeed, by induction, [′
S+1]/uni2216{l}/uni228A[′
S],[′
S+1]/uni2216{l}/uni228A[′
s]/uni2216{l}, and
by our assumption, [′
S]≠[′
s]/uni2216{l}, and by the denition of h, we haveT(′
j−h;S)∉[′
s]
andT(′
j−h;S)>max{T(1;s);T(2;s);:::;T(′
j−h;s)}. So,T(′
j−h;S)<T(′
j−h;S+1)
andT(′
j−h;S+1)∈[′
S]∪{l}. It follows that T(′
j−h+1;S)≤T(′
j−h;S+1). Since
T(′
j−h+1;S+1)>T(′
j−h;S+1)andT(′
j−h+1;S+1)∈[′
S]∪{l}, it follows that
T(′
j−h+2;S)≤T(′
j−h+1;S+1). Similarly, T(′
j−h′+1;S)≤T(′
j−h′;S+1)for
all max {′
j−′
S+1;1}≤h′≤h. And we have shown that the new tableau is indeed weakly
increasing from the S-th column to the (S+1)-th column.
Moreover, by denition we have
T(′
j−h;s)<T(′
j−h;S)<T(′
j−h+1;S)=T(′
j−h+1;s);
and the fact that [′
S]/uni228A[′
s−1],[′
s]/uni2216{l}/uni228A[′
s−1], it follows that T(′
j−h+1;s−1)≤T(′
j−h;S).
Similar to our argument above, one can see that T(′
j−h+h′;s−1)≤T(′
j−h+h′−1;s)for
all 2≤h′≤h+1. Hence, we have shown that the new tableau is weakly increasing from the
(s−1)-th column to the s-th column.
Case 7 :′
i>′
j,l∉[′
i],l∈[′
j]. We show that this is impossible.
Suppose not, by induction, we know that [′
j]/uni2216{l}⊂[′
i]. Write [′
j]=(c1<c2<:::<cm<l)
and write [′
i]/uni2216[′
j]=(x1<x2<:::<xm′),m′>0.
We rst study the case where j=i+1. Ifxm′>cm, then interchanging xm′andlgives a new
tableau. Contradiction.
Otherwise, xm′<cm. If we take out xm′from[′
i]with other integers in [′
i]undisturbed,
move every integer below the previous xm′one level up, move the lin[′
j]to the last box
of[′
i], and nally insert xm′into an appropriate position in [′
j]. One can easily check that
this new arrangement is compatible with the remaining tableau. And we have a new tableau.
Contradiction.

Now we study the case where j>i+1. Proceed by doing induction on the distance (j−i)of
two columns. Suppose we have shown that Case 7 is impossible for all pairs of (i;j)such that
0<j−i<qin any tableau of nboxes, then we can assume without loss of generality that the
cardinality of the set {′
i;′

ito the right of the i-th column contains l. Again,
we look at an example:

Tableau 4
In the above tableaux, i=1;j=4 andl=6. Every column to the right of column 1 is a subset
of[′

clockwise.
To carry this out in general, if T(′
i;i)>T(′
j−1;j), then interchange T(′
j;j)=land
T(′
i;i). By induction, the result is still a tableau. Contradiction.
Otherwise, set T(0;j)=0 and lethbe the smallest integer such that T(′
j−h;j)<T(′
i−
h+1;i). Then we move the integers:
(T(′
j−h+1;i);T(′
j−(h−1)+1;i);:::;T(′
j;i);T(′
j;j);T(′

in the tableau clockwise. By induction, [′
q]/uni2216{l}/uni228A[′

construction gives another tableau. Contradiction.
Hence, Case 7 is impossible and we have proved the necessity.

the lastgdcolumns of T. Let(d)be the weight of T/divides.alt0(d). We claim that (d)is also the weight
ofT′/divides.alt0(d).
Suppose not, there must exist an integer zthat appears in T/divides.alt0(d)more often than it does in
T′/divides.alt0(d), asT/divides.alt0(d)andT′/divides.alt0(d)have the same shape. Since Tsatises (C′

Similarly, we conclude that the i-th rectangular tableaux T/divides.alt0(i)andT′/divides.alt0(i)have the same weight

3.Proving factorization
3.1.Three kinds of rectangular tableaux. A rectangular tableau Twithmcolumns and
krows is unique of its shape and weight if and only if one of the following is true:
(1) All columns of Tare identical.(rst kind)
(2) The intersection of all columns of Thas cardinality (k−1).(second kind)
(3)Thas(k+1)distinct integers in total.(third kind)
This follows directly from proposition 1.3 and proposition 1.6 whose proof is the following.
Once theorem 1.4 is proved for each of the three kinds of the rectangular tableaux, the general
case follows from doing induction on the number of rectangular blocks in .
Proof of Proposition 1.6. Deleting one of the repeated sets doesn't change kind. So we can
without loss of generality assume that (S1;S2;:::;Sm)are all distinct. If m=1, it is the case
of the rst kind. If m=2, it is the case of both the second kind and the third kind. Suppose
m≥3./divides.alt0S1∩S2/divides.alt0=k−1 and/divides.alt0S1∪S2/divides.alt0=k+1. There are two cases: S3/slash.left⊂S1∪S2andS3⊂S1∪S2.
SupposeS3/slash.left⊂S1∪S2. ThenS1∩S2∩S3=S1/slash.right{a}=S2/slash.right{b}=S3/slash.right{c}for some distinct a;b;c ,
so/divides.alt0S1∩S2∩S3/divides.alt0=k−1. If any other Siwas to miss an element of S1∩S2∩S3, then it would
have to contain all a;b;c and would have size ≥(k−2)+3>k. Contradiction. So in this case
/divides.alt4m

i=1Si/divides.alt4=/divides.alt0S1∩S2∩S3/divides.alt0=k−1, hence it is the case of the second kind. Suppose now that S3⊂S1∪S2.
If there was any other Si/slash.left⊂S1∪S2, then we would arrive to contradiction as in the previous
case by switching S3andSi. So in this case any Si⊂S1∪S2, hence /divides.alt4m

A rectangular tableau with

Denition 3.1 (Intrinsic) .Suppose that Tis an arbitrary rectangular tableau. If a box of T
contains an integer that appears in every column of T, then delete it and move every box below
it one level up. The resulting rectangular tableau is called the intrinsic tableau of Tand we
denote it by Int (T).

Claim 3.2. The homogeneous degree mcomponent of P(mk)(1;:::;1;xk;:::;xk+m−1)is equal to

Note that∑k+m−1

i=1Ti=m(k−1). Moreover, since Ti≤mfor alli, we know
thatT1=T2=/uni22EF=Tk−1=min order to have degree min the right side of (3.3). Hence, the
intersection of weights of all columns of Tcorresponding to terms of degree min (3.3), which is
{1;2;:::;k−1}, has cardinality (k−1). It follows that the intrinsic tableau Int (T)ofTmust be
a horizontal strip with weight (kTk;:::;(k+m−1)Tk+m−1). By the denition of  (q;t), it is clear
that T(q;t)= Int(T)(q;t). Therefore, we conclude that the homogeneous degree mcomponent
ofP(mk)(1;:::;1;xk;:::;xk+m−1)is equal toP(m)(xk;:::;xk+m−1). 

ce(x1;:::;xk+m−1)
is the elementary symmetric polynomial expansion of P(mk)(x1;:::;xk+m−1).
Claim 3.3. For each/uni22A2(mk)such that the least monomial degree in e(1;:::;1;xk;:::;xk+m−1)
ism,cis equal to the coecient of e^in the elementary symmetric polynomial expansion of
P(m)(x1;:::;xm), where ^=(1−(k−1);:::;m−(k−1)).16 KONSTANTIN MATVEEV AND YUCHEN WEI
Proof. By formula 3.1, we may assume that =(1≥2≥/uni22EF≥m≥0). If the least monomial
degree ine(1;:::;1;xk;:::;xk+m−1)ism, then we claim that m≥k−1, since otherwise the least
monomial degree in e(1;:::;1;xk;:::;xk+m−1)would be no less than mk−[(m−1)(k−1)+(k−2)]=
m+1. Thus, ^=(1−(k−1);:::;m−(k−1))is a valid expression. Notice that the least
homogeneous degree component in e(1;:::;1;xk;:::;xk+m−1)is exactlye^(xk;:::;xk+m−1), which
is of degree m. For a/uni22A2mksuch that it contains a term of degree min the elementary
symmetric polynomial expansion of P(m)(1;:::;1;xk;:::;xk+m−1)implies that the least monomial
degree ine(1;:::;1;xk;:::;xk+m−1)ism. Thus, by claim 3.2 we know that
P(m)(xk;:::;xk+m−1)=/summation.disp
ce^(xk;:::;xk+m−1);
where the summation ranges over /uni22A2(mk)such that the least monomial degree in
e(1;:::;1;xk;:::;xk+m−1)
ism. Since the map that sends to ^is a bijection between the set of partitions of (mk)with
exactlymparts and each part being no less than (k−1)and the set of partitions of m, the
claim follows once we change the variables xi/uni21A6xi−(k−1),k≤i≤k+m−1. 
Vertical Pieri's formulas as Quadruples
Notice that if we multiply Pby a sequence of elementary symmetric polynomials and apply
the vertical Pieri's formula 1.1 repeatedly, then the desired coecient in the nal expansion is
completely determined by a set of quadruples such as (i;j;qi;qj),i<j, representing the hook
whose arm lies in the i-th row and whose leg ends in the j-th row.qi(respectively qj)is the
number of boxes already attached to the i(respectively j)-th row of the original tableau, before
the vertical strip to be attached(to the j-th row). Hence, we may use quadruples to represent
the corresponding  ′'s.
Note that two quadruples (i;j;qi;qj)and(I;J;qI;qJ)represent the same element in
Q(q;t;X 1;X2;:::)
if and only if 0 =i−I=j−J=(qi−qj)−(qI−qJ). This can be easily veried by the denition
of ′.
Claim 3.4. Theorem 1.4 holds for all rectangular Twithmcolumns and krows, and the
intersection of weights of all columns has cardinality (k−1).
Proof. Suppose that r1</uni22EF<rk−1are the common integers throughout all columns in T, and
Int(T)has weight (1Int(T)1;:::;lInt(T)l), wherelis the largest integer in T. Dene the sets
LInt∶={i∈[l]∶Int(T)i>0};Lr∶={r1;:::;rk−1};L0∶=[l]/uni2216(LInt∪Lr).
For tableau T, by extra quadruples (i;j;qi;qj)we mean quadruples satisfying {i;j}/uni2288LInt
and(i;j)∉L0×LInt.
When we are multiplying PbyP(mk), we can write P(mk)in its elementary symmetric
function expansion. Similarly, we can do this for P(m). By corollary 3.3, we are able to identify
the common factors as well as comparing the unique factors in these two related processes of
multiplying a sequence of elementary symmetric functions, or the two processes of attaching
vertical strips. And it boils down to keeping track of the extra quadruples induced by efrom
P(mk)and the corresponding e^fromP(m), respectively since the quadruples are the same if the
quadruples are not extra. Clearly, ∑l
i=1Int(T)i=m.
For tableau T, the extra quadruples (i;j;qi;qj)can be classied into the following disjoint

A rectangular tableau with

By the denition of  T(q;t), we can rename all distinct integers u1</uni22EF<uhas 1</uni22EF<hin
Twithout changing the value of  T(q;t). Particularly, in the case that we are considering, we
may assume without loss of generality that an integer tcan only appear either in the t-th row
or in the (t−1)-th row. As a result, we only need to keep track of the number of boxes to the
right of a particular box, since at each step of attaching a horizontal strip, there are no boxes
below any box in the horizontal strip which implies that b(s)is completely determined by the
arm length.
In the following computation, suppose that there are zkyij's such that yij=k. And we use
the arm lengths to represent the corresponding b(s). Let \a∼b" denote

All rectangular tableaux Tconsidered below are unique of its weight and shape with m
columns and krows.
Denition 3.7 (Complement) .If a rectangular tableau Thasmcolumns and krows with
(k+1)distinct integers, then each column misses exactly one of the (k+1)integers. Suppose
thatlis the largest integer in T, and the column jmisses integer yj,1≤j≤m, then the
horizontal tableau with weight (l+1−y1;l+1−y2;:::;l+1−ym)is called the complement of T.
We denote it by TC.
Denition 3.8 (Reversal) .Let=(1;:::;n)be a partition. Suppose that a rectangular tableau
Thasmcolumns and krows whose largest integer is l. For anyN>1, dene the reversal of
relative toTandNto beN(T)=(N−l;:::;N−1).
Claim 3.9. If the(k+1)distinct integers in Tare exactly: 1;2;:::;k+1, then the Macdonald
Littlewood-Richardson coecients c(;T;q;t )andc(N(T);TC;q;t)are equal for any given
N>1.
Proof. By corollary 3.6, it suces to nd for each partition of(mk), a bijection between
each summand in the coecient of P(T), from the expansion of P⋅P(mk), originating from
successively applying the vertical Pieri's formula 1.1 to the sequence of elementary symmetric
polynomials: e1;e2;:::;em, and each summand in the coecient of P(TC), from the expansion
ofPN(T)⋅P(m), originating from successively applying the vertical Pieri's formula 1.1 to the
sequence of elementary symmetric polynomials: ek+1−1;ek+1−2;:::;ek+1−m.
Suppose that at step s∈[m], the vertical strip with length sis missing rows of with
indicesv1</uni22EF<vl−s. LetVs∶={v1;:::;vl−s}. Letl(=k+1)be the largest integer in T. The

1−qi−j+qi−qjtj−i;
which is the same factor represented by the quadruple (i;j;qi;qj). Hence there is a bijection
between S1andS2. Since we have assumed that the (k+1)distinct integers in Tare exactly
1;2;:::;k+1,S2can be viewed as the set of quadruples induced by a summand in the elementary
symmetric polynomial expansion of P(m)in the specied way.
Remark: The reason that this bijection only works when l=k+1is that∑m
i=1(k+1−s)=m
whenl=k+1. Ifl>k+1, then∑m
i=1(l−s)>mand we are not able to claim that \ S2can be
viewed as the set of quadruples induced by a summand in the elementary symmetric polynomial
expansion of P(m)", since there would be more than madd-ons attached to N(T), but eache′
in the elementary symmetric polynomial expansion of P(m)satises′/uni22A2m. 
Corollary 3.10. Theorem 1.4 holds for all rectangular tableaux Twithmcolumns and krows
with(k+1)distinct integers.
Proof. Suppose that the (m−i+1)-th column of the tableau Tmisses integer yi,i∈[m],
then claim 3.5 shows that  T(q;t)= (yi1;:::;yim)(q;t). SinceP(m)is a symmetric polynomial, it
follows that  (yi1;:::;yim)(q;t)= (l+1−yim;:::;l+1−yi1)(q;t). If we add rows of identical integers less
thanlthat have never appeared in T, such that this new tableau satises the premise of claim
3.9, theniis in column cofTif and only if (l+1−i)is not in column cofTCfor anyi∈[l].
Denote this new tableau by T∗. Moreover, each factor on the right of 1.4 corresponding to the
admissible triple (i;j;t)forT∗is the same as the factor corresponding to the admissible triple
(l+1−j;l+1−i;t)N(T)forTC. It follows that we can keep track of those admissible triples or
quadruples originated from attaching vertical stripes to exclusively without involving N(T).
We are interested in the additional and missing admissible triples of Tcompared to T∗as well
as quadruples. Though we may state \compared to TC" below, the reader should keep in mind
that this is the same thing as \compared to T∗".

and we proceed by induction on d.
By formula 3.1, Pieri's formulas 1.1 and the idea of truncated expressions, we know that
P1⋅P0=P+/summation.disp

applying formula 3.1 for the special case where the partition is 1, a rectangle, we have ′
1>k1
in the summation above. We also note that ′/uni22B3′by formula 3.1.
So,
P=P1⋅P0−/summation.disp

01(q;t)P:
It follows from proposition 1.3 and the denition of  T(q;t)that for a tableau T(), unique
of its shape and weight,  T(q;t)is multiplicative in terms of the rectangular blocks of T():
 T()(q;t)= T(0)⋅ T(1)(q;t):
We rst compute the coecient of PinP⋅P1⋅P0=(P⋅P1)⋅P0. We claim that
the intermediate Macdonald polynomial Pfrom the product P⋅P1must correspond to theFACTORIZATION OF CERTAIN MACDONALD LITTLEWOOD-RICHARDSON COEFFICIENTS 23
tableauT(1)in order to get Pin the expansion of P⋅P0. Otherwise, since there will be
(m1×k1)add-ons in total compared to after multiplying P1, by proposition 1.3, there must
exist either an integer Icontained in T(0)such that the I-th row ofhas more than m1's
add-ons compared to , or an integer Jcontained in T(1)/uni2216T(0)such that the J-th row of
has more than Card (J)add-ons compared to , where Card (J)is the number of times that J
has appeared in T(1), which is also equal to the number of times that Jappears inT(). We
know that the latter case will not yield Pin the end, but the former case contradicts formula
3.1.
Let the weight of tableau T(1)be(1n1;2n2;:::;), where for any i∈Z>0,niis the number of
times thatihas appeared in T(1).
Therefore, by induction and the fact that  T(q;t)is multiplicative in terms of rectangular
blocks whenever Tis unique of its shape and weight, we compute the coecient ~ c

Assume that c(;T())=1>0 andTis unique of its shape and weight, then the Littlewood-
Richardson tableau is uniquely determined by T(). In particular, the weight of each row is
exactly the same as if we assume rows of are far apart. Namely, from left to right in each
row and from top to bottom, we rst ll the boxes with integer 1 until 1 is used up, then we
ll the boxes with integer 2 until 2 is used up,......
Proof. Ifj−1∈Int(T), then both the (j−1)-th row and the j-th row in/slash.leftare lled with
the same integer. In order that c(;T)=1>0, there should be no overlap. We deduce that
j−1−(j+cj)≥0.
Ifj−1∉Int(T), then the last ∑t<j−1ctboxes in the (j−1)-th row of /slash.leftand thej-th
row of/slash.leftare lled with the same integer. In order that c(;T)=1>0, there should be no
overlap in the last ∑t<j−1ctboxes of the (j−1)-th row with the j-th row. We deduce that

If a pair (i;j)appears in an admissible triple, then by proposition 1.6, the associated bw

containing (i;j)byNi;j. Note that aw
i;jcontinuously takes values 0 ;1;:::;Ni;j−1:The rst factor
in the parenthesis of the expression 4.3 suggests ip the Ni;jconsecutive boxes: (i;j−Ni;j+
1);(i;j−Ni;j+2);/uni22EF;(i;j)in thei-th row of. At the same time, the second factor suggests
ip theNi;jconsecutive boxes: (i;j+1);(i;j+2);/uni22EF;(i;j+Ni;j);in thei-th row of. In
particular, we note that the leg lengths (j−i)appeared in the rst factor is never equal to
zero. This hints that the ips in caused by factors from  T(q;t)does not conict with those
caused by the rst factor in 4.3.
Indeed, by Lemma 4.1 and Lemma 4.2, it is easy to see that we are guaranteed to ip the
cr, whenTis of the second kind(respectively, xr+1, whenTis of the third kind.), boxes in the
r-th row(or boxes in rows directly under the r-th row if there is any overlap) of wherecr;xr
are dened below. We elaborate as follows:FACTORIZATION OF CERTAIN MACDONALD LITTLEWOOD-RICHARDSON COEFFICIENTS 27
IfTis of the second kind, and if every row are far apart, then obviously we are done.
Otherwise, if 0 <cr;cr+1<m, then by the second inequality of Lemma 4.1, we have crboxes
with zero leg length. It remains to check for cr+1=mwhile 0<cr<m. Sincer+1 does
not contribute factors in  T(q;t), we can freely ip boxes in rows under the r-th row with m
add-ons until we reach the rst row with less than madd-ons under the r-th row. Denote this
row by row f. The rst inequality of Lemma 4.1 tells us that (f−1+m)−(f+cj)≥crif we
letiber. So, we can ip the boxes located in the lower right corners of those rows with m
add-ons under the r-th row.
IfTis of the third kind, and again, if every row are far apart, we are done. Otherwise, it
follows from Lemma 4.2 that for r;r+1∈T,
(r+m−xr)−(r+1+m−xr+1)≥xr+1
which enables us to ip xr+1boxes with zero leg length in the r-th row of.
Ifr+1∉T, and rowfis the rst row below the r-th with at least one add-on and less than
madd-ons(since if an integer appears throughout columns, then it will not contribute factors
in T(q;t)), then since xf<m−xr, we are able to ip xfboxes of zero leg length in the r-th
row of.
Thus, we can keep our discussion of  T(q;t)to a minimum from now on.
Now we are ready to work out all the details based on the above ideas. It suces to show that
only those fractions in 4.2 and 4.3 that correspond to real arm and leg lengths combinations in
;; will survive. We study the three kinds of rectangular tableaux.
•Tis of the rst kind. Suppose that Tis on shape withmcolumns. Let ibe an integer that
has never appeared in T. Then elements in {(i;j;w)∶j∈T;j>i;w∈[m]}are all admissible
triples whose rst entry is i.
Because of  T(q;t)=1, we do not ip any box in .
For boxes in , we can naturally regard factors in the form of U/slash.leftLin 4.3 as ippers of boxes
from lower to upper. Unless the desired arm-leg lengths combination does not exist in , then
we call a fraction in 4.3 ctitious if there is no box in with the corresponding arm and leg
lengths combination. A necessary condition for a fraction with leg length j−i−1 being ctitious
is that there are add-ons in both the (j−1)-th and the j-th row. We can write down all the
ctitious ippers of as

Note thatj−1 must also belong to Tif there exists a ctitious ipper of whose corresponding
admissible triple has (i;j)as the rst two entries.

It follows that
i−j−1−(m−xi)≤i−j−(m−xi) andi−j−1−1=i−j−1−1:
We know that there is no U/slash.leftLippers in the reduced form of 4.3.

So,
i−j−(m−xi)=i−j−(m−xi) andi−j−1−1=i−j−1−1:
We conclude that there is no ctitious ipper in the reduced form of 4.3.
Now we study the general case where Tthat is not necessarily rectangular.
In order to show that the Proposition 1.5 is true, we use induction on the number of vertical
blocks in.
Since we have already settled the case where only has one block, assuming that we have
shown Proposition 1.5 for all with less than dblocks, it suces to argue that Proposition 1.5 is
true forwithdblocks. Denote the rightest block in bydand the set-theoretic complement
ofdinby−
d. Denote the corresponding unique tableau on shape (respectively, d,−
d) by
T()(respectively, T(d),T(−
d)). Denote by −
dthe larger partition corresponding to T(−
d).
The induction hypothesis tells us that

d(q;t) (4.4)
is a polynomial in L;U and the number of factors in the form of Uequals the number of factors
in the form of Land the last factor in 4.4 is assimilated into the rst three factors as a sequence
of ippers characterized by their arm and leg lengths. Compare 4.4 and 1.5 as well as Theorem
1.4, since we have pointed out in the proof of the general case of Theorem 1.4 that  T(q;t)is
multiplicative in terms of the rectangular blocks whenever Tis unique of its shape and weight,
we only need to manage to realize the remaining factors of 4.3 as ippers in andand make
sure that they do not clash with the existing ippers, and nally, migrate the existing ippers
from−
dto.
To work this out, we notice that there are two cases for an admissible triple (i;j;w)inT(d)
determined by either iis inT(d).
Ifi∈T(d), then both i;jappear in every column of T(−
d)which implies that iandjcannot
appear as the rst entry of any admissible in T(−
d), therefore the new ippers will not clash32 KONSTANTIN MATVEEV AND YUCHEN WEI
with the existing ippers. Moreover, both a(i;j;w)T(d)andb(i;j;w)T(d)take the same values
as their counterparts a(i;j;w)T()andb(i;j;w)T(), respectively. Thus, we can ip the hooks
in;as if we are doing this for a rectangular discussed above, and migrate the existing
hooks without any trouble.
Ifi∉T(d), then thei-th row of−
dhas the same length as the i-th row. So, we do not have
any trouble migrating the existing hooks in the i-th row of−
d. We note that b(i;j;w)T(d)=
b(i;j;w)T(). Moreover, since the smallest a(i;j;w)T()is equal to the largest a(i;j;w)T(−
d)
plus one, we know that we can just keep ipping the corresponding hooks in the i-th row of
as well asfrom where they are left towards the right. And this nishes the proof.
