1. Introduction
Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a rapidly growing
ﬁeldwithmanyapplicationsinﬁeldssuchashealthcare,cus-
tomer service, media, education, and forensics. While deep
learning (DL) has shown promise in developing SER sys-
tems, their performance is still limited by the scarcity of
emotion datasets [20, 24]. Existing SER corpora are small
since the process of creating emotional data is costly and
time-consuming, as multiple annotators have to manually
listentoandannotatethematerial[26,31]. Toincreasedata
size,somestudieshaveusedmultiplecorpora,butthenum-
berofstandardbenchmarkdatasetsisalsolimited,hindering
progress in SER systems [19].
Researchershavelongbeeninterestedincreatingnatural-
sounding TTS systems. TTS technology has come a long
way from early TTS systems that often used pre-recorded
waveforms pieced together based on input text [11]. Such
systems were prone to boundary artefact issues and statis-
tical techniques were later developed to generate smoothed
audiofeaturesforthevocodertosynthesisespeech[37,44].
Morerecently,end-to-endneuralnetwork-basedapproaches
havebeenproposedthatcansynthesisemorenatural-sounding

are trained using DL algorithms in an end-to-end fashion,
withpopularmodelsincludingTacotron[41],Deepvoice[3],
Fastspeech [33, 34], Fastpitch [18], to name a few.
Unlike traditional systems, end-to-end TTS models can
learn to generate a spectrogram directly from text without
any complex pre-processing. These models, however, are
currentlyonlyabletosynthesisenaturalspeech. Usinggen-
erative DL techniques such as generative adversarial net-
works (GANs) [8] for emotional speech synthesis is also
challenging, as it requires a large amount of time-aligned
data of a single speaker speaking the same content in dif-

or complex pre-processing of input data. Inspired by the
success of end-to-end TTS models, we adopt a similar ar-
chitecture to Tacotron. We propose to use a condition en-
coder to control the speakers’ voices and emotions in the
output speech. We generate speaker voice feature vectors
usingtheencodernetwork. Thesefeaturevectorsaremodu-

we trained our model and hyper-parameters are provided in

Inthissection,wereviewtheliteraturethathasemerged
around(1)theuseofTacotronforTTS,andfor(2)emotional
speech synthesis, and (3) the process of augmenting SER.
2.1. Tacotron Based TTS Systems
ManyrecentstudieshavefocusedonmodifyingtheTacotron
model in order to better control the output of TTS systems.
For instance, [13] presented a Tacotron-based model that
synthesisesmulti-speakerspeechbyconditioningtheTacotron
onthespeaker’svoiceembedding,whichwasgeneratedfrom
aspeakerveriﬁcationmodel[40]. [42]introducedaTacotron
variant that can change the speaking style, by learning dif-
ferent styles and saving them as vectors or tokens. These
tokens are obtained by clustering similar accents and repre-
senting each cluster with an average. During synthesis, the
Tacotron is conditioned on one of these tokens to produce
speech with a speciﬁc style. [35] presented a multi-speaker
Tacotron that can change accents (e.g., American, Indian,
British). Their model uses two encoder networks with the
Tacotron and requires two audio samples (one for the ac-
cent and one for the speaker’s voice) as input to generate
the desired output. [36] proposed a Tacotron model that is
trainedwithencodedoutputaudiofromavariationalautoen-
coder as input. This not only improves the multi-speaker
performanceofTacotronbutalsoallowsforcontroloverthe
energy of the generated audio through the mean-variance
property of the variational autoencoder. [43] developed a
Tacotron model that can learn more complex vocalisations
by using the self-attention mechanism in Tacotron to learn
complex dependencies related to pitch in diﬀerent accents.
They claim that their model outperforms traditional end-to-
endapproachesforlanguageswithmorepitch-dependentac-
cents, such as Japanese. Our proposed model also gener-
atesspeechinamulti-speakersettingandincludesadditional
control over the emotions in the output.
2.2. Tacotron Based Emotional TTS Systems
Severalpreviousworkshaveattemptedtogenerateemo-
tional speech using TTS systems. For example, [38] devel-
opedanemotioncontrolmethodforaTTSsystembasedon
the GST-Tacotron network [35], and demonstrated its eﬀec-
tivenessinsynthesisingemotionalspeechinasingle-speaker
settinginKorean. [27]alsoevaluatedaTacotron-basedemo-
tionalspeechsynthesizerinKorean,andfoundimprovements
in the quality of the generated speech for a single speaker.
Other studies, such as [15, 17], have also proposed meth-
odsforcontrollingemotionalspeechsynthesis,buttheseap-
proachesonlysynthesiseemotionalspeechinasinglespeaker’s
voice. In contrast, our proposed method achieves control
over emotional speech synthesis for multi-speaker TTS and
we also evaluate the quality of the synthesised data to aug-
ment the SER system.
2.3. Augmenting Techniques for SER
Speed perturbation [16] is a popular data augmentation
technique that has been widely studied in diﬀerent contexts[2,23]. Ithasbeenfoundtoimprovespeechemotionrecog-
nition (SER) performance by creating copies of input data
withdiﬀerentspeedeﬀects. Mixup[45]isanotherdataaug-
mentation technique that generates augmented samples as a
linear combination of original samples from the input data.
Severalstudieshavedemonstratedtheeﬀectivenessofmixup
inSER,includingLatifetal.[25],whousedthetechniqueto
augmentanSERsystemandachieveimprovedperformance
androbustness. ArecentmethodcalledSpecAugment[30],
originally proposed for automatic speech recognition, has
alsobeenappliedtoSER[4]. Inthisstudy,theauthorsaug-
mented the SER system with duplicate samples by a factor
of two and found that SpecAugment improved model per-
formance. Other studies [2, 21, 23] have also achieved im-
proved performance by using input perturbation-based data
augmentation techniques to increase the training data.
Further research is required to explore data-driven ap-
proachestoincreasethetrainingdataforSER.Inthispaper,

3. Proposed Framework
WeproposetogeneratesyntheticspeechusingaTacotron-
based emotional TTS system. We use synthetic speech data
toaugmentthespeechemotionclassiﬁer. Thedetailsofboth
emotional TTS and classiﬁer are presented next.
3.1. Emotional Speech Synthesis

fromagiventextandembeddingvector,whileaWave-RNN-
based vocoder is used to generate an audio signal from the
Mel-spectrogram
3.1.1. Condition Encoder
We propose using a condition encoder to create an em-
bedding that represents both speaker identity and emotion.
To do this, we use a speaker identiﬁcation model presented
in[40],whichcreatesaﬁxed-dimensionalembedding,known
asad-vector[10,39],usingasequenceofMel-spectrograms

ding as well. Thus, the condition encoder is optimised to
maximise the cosine similarity between embeddings of the
same speaker with diﬀerent emotions and to minimise the
similarity between diﬀerent emotions and diﬀerent speak-
ers. Inthisway,themodellearnstogenerateafeaturevector

The condition encoder consists of three LSTM layers
with 768 cells each, and a ﬁnal 256-length fully connected
layer. TheinputtothemodelistheMel-spectrogramgener-
ated from a speech utterance of a reference speaker’s audio
sample, and its output is an embedding vector of size 256
which represents the speaker’s identity. After training the
model, we use it to extract speaker and emotional informa-
tion from a given audio. To separate the emotion from thespeaker’s voice, we generate vectors that only contain emo-
tionalinformationbyusingthetrainedconditionencoderto
generate embedding vectors for both the neutral and emo-
tional voices of the same speaker. The neutral embedding
vectoristhensubtractedfromtheemotionalonesusingEqua-
tion (4), resulting in a vector that only contains emotional
information. This vector can be used at inference time to
control the emotion of the synthesised audio.

dio embedding (voice in which we want our output sample
to be synthesised) and emotional embedding are added to
generate a ﬁnal embedding vector.

Finally, the modulated embedding vector and text are fed
to Tacotron, which generates the Mel-spectrograms. These
Mel-spectrograms are converted to the time domain using a
vocoder, resulting in an audio signal.

tion layers, which learn longer-term context like an n-gram.
The output of these convolution layers is passed to a single

dependencies from these n-gram-like features. The LSTM
layer returns an encoded vector that fully represents the in-
puttextsequence. Thisvectorisconcatenatedwithavector

cludes a location-sensitive attention mechanism that trans-
forms the input embedding into a ﬁxed-length vector. The

is passed through a 5-layer convolution network called the
PostNet to improve overall reconstruction.
3.1.3. Vocoder
Traditionally, the Griﬃn-Lim algorithm [9] was used to
generate time-domain audio from a spectrogram, but it was
slow and the output speech lacked naturalness. To address
this, we use a vocoder based on the WaveRNN architecture
[14],whichisafasterandmorepowerfulrecurrentnetwork
for sequential modelling of high-ﬁdelity audio. It employs
residual convolutions and GRU layers to generate a time-
domainaudiosignalframebyframefromaMel-spectrogram.
3.2. Emotion Classiﬁer
Toevaluatethesynthesisedemotions,wetrainedadeep
neural network (DNN) for SER. We implemented a convo-
lutionalneuralnetwork(CNN)-basedclassiﬁerthatconsists
of a convolutional layer, a batch normalisation layer, and a
denselayerbeforethesoftmaxlayer. Mel-frequencycepstral
coeﬃcients (MFCCs) are used as the input to the classiﬁer.
TheCNNlayerslearnhigh-levelfeaturesfromtheinputfea-
tures, which are then transformed by the dense layer into a
more discriminative space for better emotion classiﬁcation
after passing through the normalisation layer.
4. Experimental Protocol
This section describes the details of the dataset, input
feature, and model training.4.1. Datasets
We used the Librispeech dataset [29] to train our TTS
model. Itconsistsof1000hoursofspeechdatafromvarious
speakers, sampled at 16 kHz. For the emotion embeddings,
we used the Emotional Voices Database (EVD) [1] and the
TorontoEmotionalSpeechSet(TESS)[7],whichcontainsix
diﬀerent speakers reading diﬀerent sentences with diﬀerent
emotions. We conducted multiple experiments to evaluate
the performance of our model. For emotion classiﬁcation
experiments, we used the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database
ofEmotionalSpeechandSong(RAVDESS)[28]andTESS.
Forcross-corpusemotionclassiﬁcation,weusedtheCREMA-
D[6],SAVEE[12],EmoDB[5],andsynthesisedaudio. The
details of these datasets are presented in Table 1. We used
one speaker from Librispeech, as well as all the speakers
from EVD and TESS with two samples that were not in-
cluded in the training set, to determine the mean opinion
score. Foremotionclassiﬁcationexperiments,weusespeaker-

zontal axis as in a previous work [32].
4.3. Speech Synthesis Models Training
First, the encoder is trained on the Librispeech dataset
to learn to generate a speaker embedding that is distinct for
each speaker. It takes a Mel-spectrogram as input and out-
puts an embedding vector of size 256. From these embed-
dingvectors,asimilaritymatrixisconstructedsuchthateach
column contains an embedding vector for a unique speaker,
andcosinesimilarityismaximisedinallcellsofthecolumns
and minimised in all cells of the rows. Cosine similarity is
maximised along the columns because they contain audio
embeddings for the same person, whereas it is minimised

along the rows because they contain audio embeddings for
diﬀerent people. In this way, the embeddings of the same
people are similar and those of diﬀerent people are diﬀer-
ent.
After training the encoder on the Librispeech data, it is
ﬁne-tuned on the EVD and TESS datasets to generate dis-
tinct embedding vectors for diﬀerent emotions. This time,
a similarity matrix is constructed such that a column con-
tains embedding vectors generated for a single emotion for
the same speaker, and other emotions are placed in other
columns. Thisisdoneforallspeakers,andthencosinesim-
ilarity is maximised along a column and minimised across
columns. This is done to increase the distance between dif-
ferent emotions of the same person, so cosine similarity is
minimised by adding it across columns rather than within
the same columns. We used a batch size of 30 and a learn-
ing rate of 10*4.
Duringtraining,thesynthesizermodelisﬁrsttrainedon
the Librispeech data so that it can learn to generate audio
of diﬀerent speakers from a diverse range of text. This is
becausetheEVDandTESSdatasetscombinedonlyhavesix
speakers. Once the synthesizer is trained enough that it can
generate audio resembling the reference speaker, we ﬁne-
tune it to generate diﬀerent emotional Mel-spectrograms by
trainingitontheEVDandTESSdatasets. Weusealearning

The teacher forcing ratio is set to 1 (meaning the original
previous sequence is shown to the model for prediction of
the next sequence). The mean squared error is minimised
for the predicted Mel-spectrogram.
5. Results
In this section, we evaluate the performance of our pro-
posed model in terms of the similarity of the synthesized
speakers and the granularity of synthesized emotions.

achieved an EER of 0.16% when using the proposed model
for both emotion and voice conversion. The EER on real
samples using the approach in [13] was 0.04%. We have
compared the EER of these models in Table 2.
5.1.2. Listening Experiments
We performed mean opinion score (MOS) evaluations

ing to the audio based on the following standard: 1 = Bad;
2 = Poor; 3 = Fair; 4 = Good; and 5 = Excellent. The re-
sults, shown in Table 3, indicate that the proposed model
can synthesise high-quality emotional speech compared to
the baseline model. The proposed model signiﬁcantly im-
proves the MOS score for emotions including angry, sad,
and happy compared to the baseline. However, it achieves
slightly lower MOS scores for natural speech compared to
the baseline. This may be because the baseline model is
speciﬁcally designed to generate natural speech and there-
fore performs better for neutral speech. Nevertheless, our

racy not only on the SAVEE and EMODB datasets without
ﬁne-tuning the model but also on the CREMA-D test set as
well.
5.2.3. Changing Gender and Speaker Distributions
In this experiment, we compare the results of data aug-
mentation with new speaker voices that are not present in
the given corpus. For instance, the SAVEE corpus has four
malespeakers,andsyntheticdatacanbecreatedeitherinthe

model, which was trained without any augmentation, and
also with the application of speed perturbation to the train-

tional TTS system for synthetic speech generation in dif-
ferent speaker voices and use it for data augmentation in
speech emotion recognition to improve performance. The
results showed that the proposed TTS system can generate
high-quality emotionally discriminative samples. When we
