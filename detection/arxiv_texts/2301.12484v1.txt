M. PRIMC
Abstract. In this note we conjecture Rogers-Ramanujan type colored pa rti-
tion identities for an array Nodd
wwith odd number of rows wsuch that the
ﬁrst and the last row consist of even positive integers. In a s trange way this
is diﬀerent from the partition identities for the array Nwwith odd number of
rowswsuch that the ﬁrst and the last row consist of odd positive int egers—the
partition identities conjectured by S. Capparelli, A. Meur man, A. Primc and
the author and related to standard representations of the aﬃ ne Lie algebra of
typeC(1)
ℓforw= 2ℓ+1. The conjecture is based on numerical evidence.
This note is dedicated to Marko Tadi´ c at the occasion of his 7 0th birthday.
1.Introduction
We write a partition of positive integer nin terms of frequencies fj—the number
of occurrences of the part jin the partition
(1.1) n=/summationdisplay
j∈Nfj·j= 1+···+1/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
f1times+2+···+2/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
f2times+... .
It is clear that fj= 0 for all but ﬁnitely many j∈Nand that the partition (1.1) is
determined by its sequence of frequencies ( fi|i∈N).
The partition identities of Rogers (1894), Ramanujan (1913) and S chur (1917)
fork= 1, and the partition identities of Gordon (1961) for k≥2, can be stated as:
Let0≤a≤k. The number of partitions of nsuch that
(1.2) fj+fj+1≤kfor alljand
(1.3) f1≤a
equals the number of partitions of ninto parts /ne}ationslash≡0,±(a+1) mod (2 k+3).
Theconditions(1.2)onfrequenciesoftwoadjacentnumbersarec alledthe diﬀerence
conditions , and the condition (1.3) on the frequency of number 1 is called the initial
condition . There are some other similar partition identities stating that the nu mber
of partitions of nsatisfying certain diﬀerence & initial conditions is equal to the
number of partitions of nwith parts satisfying certain congruence conditions; these
identities are often called the classical Rogers-Ramanujan type identities—see [A].
On the other side, some parts of representation theory of aﬃne K ac-Moody Lie
algebras lead to Rogers-Ramanujan type coloredpartition identities.
LetN1,...,N r,r≥2, be non-empty subsets of the set of positive integers N
and letNbe the multiset
(1.4) N=N1∪···∪Nr.

If a positive integer aappears in several subsets Ni, thenaappears in the multiset
Nseveral times. To see these elements in Nas diﬀerent, for each positive integer
awe may “color” a∈Njwith a “color” jby writting aj= (a,j)∈Nj×{j}, and
then write (1.4) in terms of sets as
(1.5) N= (N1×{1})∪···∪(Nr×{r})⊂N×{1,...,r}.
We say that elements in the multiset Nappear in rcolors. In this note a colored
partition of positive integer non the multiset Nis
(1.6) n=/summationdisplay
a∈Nfa·a.
It is clear that fa= 0 for all but ﬁnitely many a∈ Nand that the partition (1.6)
is determined by its “sequence” of frequencies ( fa|a∈ N).
Example 1.1. LetN=N1∪N2, where
N1={j∈N|j≡2,8 mod 10 }, N2={j∈N|j≡1,2,4,5,6,8,9 mod 10 }.
Then parts aof colored partitions (1.6) for N=N1∪N2appear in two colors, 1
and2: parts≡2,8 mod 10 appear in both colors, and parts ≡1,4,5,6,9 mod 10
appear only in color 2. Note that the generating function for colored partitions ( 1.6)
is the inﬁnite periodic product with modulus 10:

j≡1,2,2,4,5,6,8,8,9 mod 10(1−qj)−1.
Lepowsky and Wilson gave in [LW] a Lie theoretic interpretation of th e classi-
cal Rogers-Ramanujan type partition identities in terms of charac ters of standard
modules LA(1)
1(Λ) for aﬃne Kac-Moody Lie algebra of the type A(1)
1. After their
discovery it was expected that for each standard module Lg(A)(Λ) for any aﬃne Lie
algebrag(A) (cf. [K]) there is a Rogers-Ramanujan type partition identity, wh ere
A(1)
1is just “the smallest one” on the list of all aﬃne Lie algebras:

In [CMPP] Rogers-Ramanujan type partition identities are conject ured for all
standard C(1)
ℓ-modules, statingthatthenumberofcoloredpartitionsof nwithparts
satisfying certain congruenceconditions is equal to the number of coloredpartitions
(1.6) for a multiset N=N2ℓ+1composed of ℓcopies of Nand an additional copy
of (2N+ 1), satisfying diﬀerence & initial conditions similar to (1.2)–(1.3) , bu t
much more complicated. Moreover, in [CMPP] another series of simila r partition
identities is conjectured for a multiset N=N2ℓcomposed of ℓcopies of N, sat-
isfying certain diﬀerence & initial conditions, but with no obvious conn ection to
representation theory of aﬃne Lie algebras.
In this note we conjecture yet another Rogers-Ramanujan type colored partition
identities for a multiset N=Nodd
2ℓ−1, somewhat similar to the conjectured identities
for standard C(1)
ℓ-modules, but again with no obvious connection to representation
theory of aﬃne Lie algebras.NEW PARTITION IDENTITIES FOR ODD WODD 3
2.Arrays with odd width wand even first row
LetN=Nodd
5be the colored array of natural numbers with 5 rows
(2.1)21416181
11315171
22426282
12325272
23436383... .
Nis a multiset composed of 2 copies of Nand an additional copy of 2 N, but its
elements are arranged in such a way that in the ﬁrst row are even nu mbers and
that numbers increase by one going to the right on any diagonal.
We consider colored partitions
(2.2) n=/summationdisplay
a∈Nfa·a,
wherefais the frequency of the part a∈ Nin the colored partition (2.2) of n. It
is clear that fa= 0 for all but ﬁnitely many a∈ Nand that the colored partition
(2.2) is determined by its array Fof frequencies
(2.3) F=f21 f41 f61 f81
f11 f31 f51 f71
f22 f42 f62 f82
f12 f32 f52 f72
f23 f43 f63 f83... .
We say that two elements in the array Fareadjacent if they are simultaneously
on two adjacent rows and two adjacent diagonals. For example, f51andf71in the
second row are adjacent to f61in the ﬁrst row and, just as well, adjacent to f62in
the third row. We say that the set1{a1,a2,a3,...}is a downward path Zin the
arrayFifaiis in the i-th row and if ( ai,ai+1) is a pair of two adjacent elements
for alli. For example, Z={f61,f51,f62,f72,f63}is a downward path in Fand
there are altogether 24downward paths through f61in the ﬁrst row.
Letkbe a positive integer. We say that the frequency array Fsatisﬁes level k
diﬀerence conditions if
(2.4)/summationdisplay
m∈Zm≤kfor all downward paths ZinF.
Note that the level kdiﬀerence conditions for a frequency array Fis similar to
diﬀerence conditions (1.2) for a sequence of frequencies ( fi|i∈N), but much more
complicated.
Letk0,k1,k2,k3∈N0,k=k0+k1+k2+k3>0. We say that an array of
frequencies Fis(k0,k1,k2,k3)odd-admissible ifthe extended array of frequencies

F(k0,k1,k2,k3)odd=k3 f21 f41 f61 f81

satisﬁes the level kdiﬀerence conditions, that is
(2.6)/summationdisplay
m∈Zm≤kfor all downward paths ZinF(k0,k1,k2,k3)odd.
Note the diﬀerence between (2.4) and (2.6): ( k0,k1,k2,k3)odd-admissible frequency
arrayFsatisﬁes the level kdiﬀerence conditions (2.4), but in addition to that there
are new conditions on the frequencies at the beginning of the array , somewhat
similar to initial condition (1.3), but much more complicated. For examp le,f11
in the second row must be ≤k2because of (2.6) for the downward path Z=
{k3,f11,0,k1,k0}.
We say that colored partitions (2.2) with ( k0,k1,k2,k3)odd-admissible arrays of
frequencies (2.3) are ( k0,k1,k2,k3)odd-admissible colored partitions .
Up till now we discussed the colored array of natural numbes N=Nodd
5with 5
rows, but all the notions can be extended to arrays Nodd
wwithw= 2ℓ−1 rows for
ℓ= 2,3,4,...with initial “imaginary frequences” being (from the bottom row to
the top row):
•(k0,k1,k2)odd= [k0,k1,k2] for ℓ= 2,w= 3,
•(k0,k1,k2,k3)odd= [k0,k1,0,k2,k3] for ℓ= 3,w= 5,
•(k0,k1,k2,k3,k4)odd= [k0,k1,0,k2,0,k3,k4] for ℓ= 4,w= 7,
• ...
•(k0,k1,...,k ℓ−1,kℓ)odd= [k0,k1,0,k2,0,k3,0,...,0,kℓ−1,kℓ] forℓ≥5.
We say that colored partitions (2.2) on N=N2ℓ−1with (k0,k1,...,k ℓ−1,kℓ)odd-
admissible arrays of frequencies (2.3) are ( k0,k1,...,k ℓ−1,kℓ)odd-admissible colored
partitions .
Conjecture 2.1. Letℓ≥2andk0,k1,...,k ℓ∈N0,k=k0+···+kℓ>0. Then the
generating function for (k0,k1,...,k ℓ−1,kℓ)odd-admissible colored partitions can be
expresed as an inﬁnite periodic product with modulus 2ℓ+2k.
This conjecture is based on numerical evidence: we calculate2the number an
of (k0,k1,...,k ℓ−1,kℓ)odd-admissible colored partitions of nand then use Euler’s
factorization algorithm to write the generating function of partitio ns/summationtextanqnas an
inﬁnite periodic product—the Python code is available at
https://github.com/mirkoprimc/odd_w_odd
Bellow are listed some results, where
•“[1, 0, 0] product: [2, 3, 4] mod 6” means that the conjectured ge nerating
function for (1 ,0,0)odd-admissible colored partitions is

Remark 2.2. From the list above we see that we may expect Roger-Ramanujan
type colored partition identities for most of (k0,k1,...,k ℓ−1,kℓ)odd-admissible para-
meters—like the conjectured product formula (1.7) for the g enerating function of
(1,2,0)odd-admissible colored partitions. It seems that for all the ot her param-
eters there is no inﬁnite periodic product; the ﬁrst possibl e case are parameters
