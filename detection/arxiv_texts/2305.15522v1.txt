Abstract
We characterize all real matrix semigroups satisfying a mil d boundedness assump-
tion, without assuming continuity. Besides the continuous solutions of the semigroup
functional equation, we give a description of solutions ari sing from non-measurable so-
lutions of Cauchy’s functional equation. To do so, we discus s the primary decomposi-
tion and the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition of a matrix sem igroup. Our motivation
stems from a characterization of all multi-dimensional sel f-similar Gaussian Markov
processes, which is given in a companion paper.

1 Introduction
It is a classical fact that all continuous matrix-valued functions g: [0,∞)→Rn×nsatisfying
the semigroup property
g(x+y) =g(x)g(y), x,y≥0, (1.1)
g(0) = 1, (1.2)
are given by the maps g(x) = exp( Mx), where M∈Rn×nis arbitrary. See, e.g., Prob-
lem 2.1 in [4] and the subsequent discussion. To the best of our knowle dge, few authors have

1considered non-continuous solutions of (1.1) in the multidimensional cased >1. Kuczma
and Zajtz [8] determine all matrix semigroups ( g(x))x∈Rwherex/ma√sto→g(x) is measurable.
Zajtz [12] characterizes the matrix semigroups ( g(x))x∈Qindexed by rational numbers. The
one-dimensional case, which is equivalent to Cauchy’s functional eq uation,
f(x)+f(y) =f(x+y), f:R→R, (1.3)
is well studied, on the other hand (see [1, 2]). Our motivation to inves tigate non-continuous
matrix semigroups stems from probability theory: In a companion pa per, we develop a char-
acterization of all self-similar Gaussian Markov processes. By self- similarity, the bivariate
covariance function of such a multi-dimensional stochastic proces s can be transformed to a
matrix function of a single argument, which must satisfy (1.1). See S ection 2 for some more
details. Our main result (Theorem 2.6) determines all solutions of (1.1 ) which satisfy a mild
boundedness assumption. In Section 3, we provide a decomposition of the vector space into
invariant subspaces, and establish some useful properties of the decomposition. The main
proofs (in Section 5) are preceded by a discussion of the Jordan–C hevalley decomposition
of a semigroup, in Section 4. In Appendix A, we give two auxiliary result s on Cauchy’s
functional equation.
2 Preliminaries and main result
To motivate our investigation, we ﬁrst recall some facts about Gau ssian Markov processes
(see, e.g., [9, 10] for more information). Let X= (Xt)t≥0be ad-dimensional real centered
Gaussian process. The covariance of Xis a matrix-valued function ( s,t)/ma√sto→R(s,t)∈Rd×d
satisfying
vTR(s,t)u=E[XT
svXT
tu], s,t≥0, u,v∈Rd,
and uniquely characterizes the law of the process. Suppose that Xis self-similar, and that
R(1,1) = id is the identity matrix. In terms of the covariance function, se lf-similarity means
thatR(as,at) =a2HR(s,t) fora,s,t >0 and some self-similarity parameter H >0. By a
classical criterion [3, Theorem V.8.1], Xis a Markov process if and only if its covariance
function satisﬁes
R(s,t)R(t,t)−1R(t,u) =R(s,u),0≤s≤t≤u. (2.1)
Upon introducing g(x) :=R(e−x,1), self-similarity allows to reduce (2.1) to
g(x)g(y) =g(x+y), x,y,≥0.
This observation has been used in dimension d= 1 to prove that certain Gaussian processes
do not have the Markov property (see, e.g., [10, Theorem 2.3]). Un ifying and generalizing
these results in a companion paper, we obtain a classiﬁcation of all d-dimensional self-similar
Gaussian Markov processes. A full classiﬁcation requires ﬁnding all solutions of (1.1), with-
out assuming continuity. The boundedness assumption 2.5 stated b elow causes no problems,
though. To state our main result, deﬁne the rotation matrix

consisting of k/2 rotation matrices. In our statements, νwill denote some non-measurable
(equivalently, non-continuous)solutionof (1.3). Thefollowingassu mptionisinforcethrough-
out the paper.
Assumption 2.1. In the following, Vdenotes a real d-dimensional vector space equipped
with an inner product /an}bracketle{t·,·/an}bracketri}ht.
Deﬁnition 2.2. We write L(V)for the set of linear maps from Vto itself. The operator
norm induced by the inner product /an}bracketle{t·,·/an}bracketri}htis denoted by /bardbl ·/bardblop. If the basis is clear from the
context, we will identify elements of L(V)andd×dmatrices.
Deﬁnition 2.3. We say that g:R≥0→L(V)is a semigroup if g(0) = idand
g(x+y) =g(x)g(y)
for allx,y≥0. Semigroups acting on VC, the complexiﬁcation of V, are deﬁned by the same
property.
Deﬁnition 2.4. We say that a semigroup (g(x))x≥0inL(V)is elementary if there exists an
orthonormal basis such that
g(x) = exp(Mx), x≥0,org(x) =Qν
d(x)exp(Mx), x≥0,
for some non-continuous νsatisfying Cauchy’s equation (1.3)and some matrix M∈Rd×d.
Assumption 2.5. The semigroup g(x)x≥0satisﬁes /bardblg(x)/bardblop≤f(x),x≥0, wheref:
[0,∞)→Ris locally bounded, right-continuous at 0and satisﬁes f(0) = 1.
We can now state our main theorem, which will be proven at the end of Section 5.
Theorem 2.6. Let(g(x))x≥0be a semigroup satisfying Assumption 2.5. Then there exists
an orthogonal decomposition V=/circleplustextn
i=1Visuch that each Viis invariant under g(x), and
eitherg(x)is elementary on Viorg(x)|Vi= 0forx >0.
3 Primary decomposition of semigroups
Deﬁnition 3.1. LetSbe a linear operator on the vector space V. A subspace U⊆Vis
calledS-invariant if SmapsUintoU.
The primary decomposition theorem from linear algebra [11, Theore m 1.5.1] decomposes
a vector space into invariant subspaces for a given operator. On e ach subspace, the operator
has a single real eigenvalue or a pair of conjugate complex eigenvalue s. Instead of a single
operator, we need the following version for semigroups.
3Theorem 3.2 (Primary decomposition) .For any semigroup (g(x))x≥0of linear maps acting
onVthere exists a decomposition V=/circleplustextn
i=1Viwithdim(Vi)≥1such that each Viis
g(x)-invariant for all x≥0, and for all ione of the following holds:
(1) For all x≥0,g(x)has one eigenvalue λ(x)≥0onVi,
(2) For all x≥0,g(x)has eigenvalues λ(x),λ(x)∈ConVi. They may coincide (and thus
be real) for some values of x, but not for all x≥0.
Proof.It is known that the primary decomposition extends to commuting se ts of matrices.
Indeed, the decomposition V=/circleplustextn
i=1Viinto invariant subspaces follows from Theorem 5
on p. 40 in [7], applied to the span of the semigroup ( g(x))x≥0. Thus, we only need to
argue why (1) or (2) follows from the semigroup property. Assume that each g(x) has
only one eigenvalue λ(x)∈Ron some Vi. Since the g(x) commute, they share a common
eigenvector vi, and thus we have λ(x)λ(y) =λ(x+y) forx,y≥0. Suppose λ(x0)<0
for some x0>0. Then we have λ(x0) =λ(x0/2)2, and hence λ(x0/2)/ne}ationslash∈R, contradicting
λ(x)∈Rfor allx≥0. Hence λ(x)∈R≥0for allx≥0.
Theorem 3.3. Consider a semigroup g= (g(x))≥0acting on VC, the complexiﬁcation of V.
Then there exists a decomposition VC=/circleplustextn
i=1Viwithdim(Vi)≥1such that, for each iand
allx≥0, the space Viisg(x)-invariant and g(x)has only one eigenvalue λ(x)∈ConVi.
Proof.This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 5 on p. 40 in [7] (cf. the p receding
proof).
Deﬁnition 3.4. We call the decomposition from Theorem 3.2 simultaneous rea l primary
decomposition (SRPD), omitting “w.r.t. g” if the semigroup is clear from the context. The
component Viis of ﬁrst type in case (1), and of second type in case (2). Simi larly, the
simultaneous primary decomposition (SPD) is the decomposi tion from Theorem 3.3.
Lemma 3.5. Letgbe a semigroup acting on V, and let Vi⊆Vbe a subspace of ﬁrst type
from the SRPD of V. Then there exists a common eigenvector v∈Vsuch that g(x)v=λ(x)v
for allx >0.
Proof.We present an algorithm which yields the subspace of common eigenve ctors. If Vi=:
V(0)
iitself is this subspace, then we are done. Otherwise there exists x0>0 such that the
eigenspace V(1)
iofg(x0) is a strict subspace of Vi. For any y >0 and any v∈V(1)
iwe have
0 =g(y)0 =g(y)[λ(x0)v−g(x0)v]
=λ(x0)[g(y)v]−g(x0)[g(y)v].
It follows that V(1)
iisg(x)-invariant for all x >0. Now either V(1)
iconsists of common
eigenvectors, or we can again ﬁnd x1>0 such that the eigenspace V(2)
iofg(x1) inV(1)
iis a
strict subspace of V(1)
i. Repeating this argument yields a sequence of nontrivial subspace s
V(n)
iwhose dimensions are strictly decreasing, hence it has to terminate . Clearly, the ﬁnal
vector space in this sequence is the space of common eigenvectors of the semigroup.
4Lemma 3.6. Letgbe a semigroup acting on V, and let Vibe a subspace from the SRPD
ofVsuch that there exists x0>0withλ(x0) = 0. Then we have λ(x) = 0for allx >0.
Furthermore Vi⊆ker(g(x))for allx >0.
Proof.By the previous lemma there exists a common eigenvector v∈Vi. (Since commuting
matrices are simultaneously triangularizable it follows that they shar e a common eigenvector
v∈VC.) We have
λ(x+y)v=g(x+y)v=g(x)g(y)v=λ(x)λ(y)v.
Henceλsatisﬁesλ(x)λ(y) =λ(x+y). Since λ(x0) = 0 we have λ(x0/n) = 0 for all n∈N
sinceλ(x0/n)n= 0. Let y >0, then there exists n∈Nsuch that x0/n < y. We obtain
λ(y) =λ(x0/n)λ(y−x0/n) = 0.
Sinceλ(y) = 0 for all y >0 it follows that the characteristic polynomial of g(y) satisﬁes
χg(y)(Z) =Zdim(Vi)and hence, by the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, g(y)dim(Vi)≡0. Forv∈Vi
we obtain
g(y)v=g(y/dim(Vi))dim(Vi)v= 0.
Corollary 3.7. Letgbe a semigroup acting on V, with SRPD V=/circleplustextn
i=1Vi. For any x >0
we haveker(g(x)) =/circleplustext
i∈IVi, where
I={i|Viof type 1 with λ≡0}.
Proof.IfVi⊆ker(g(x)), then 0 = λ(x)∈Rfor allx≥0 and hence Viis of type 1. By the
previous lemma we have
ker(g(x))⊇/circleplusdisplay
i∈IVi.
If the inclusion was strict, then there would exist Vjwithj/ne}ationslash∈Isuch that ker( g(x))∩Vj/ne}ationslash=∅.
But since g(x) is invertible on Vjthis gives a contradiction, hence we have equality.
Corollary 3.8. Letgbe a semigroup acting on V. Then there exists a decomposition V=
V1⊕V2, such that g(x)|V1is invertible for all x≥0andg(x)|V2≡0forx >0.
4 MultiplicativeJordan–Chevalleydecompositionofsemi-
groups
DuetoCorollary3.8, fromnowonweassume inmost ofourstatement s thatg(x)isinvertible
for allx≥0. A standard result from linear algebra, the Jordan–Chevalley dec omposition,
asserts that any matrix Acan be uniquely decomposed as A=D+N, whereDis diagonal-
izable,Nis nilpotent and DandNcommute. If Ais invertible, then we can express it as
A=D(id+D−1N) :=DTwithTunipotent and commuting with D.
Deﬁnition 4.1. For an invertible linear map AonKdwithK∈ {R,C}, the multiplicative
decomposition A=DTinto commuting factors with Ddiagonalizable and Tunipotent, is
called the multiplicative Jordan–Chevalley decompositio n.
5For background on the (multiplicative) Jordan–Chevalley decompos ition, we refer to
Section 15.1 in [6]. We now analyze the structure of the multiplicative Jo rdan–Chevalley
decomposition of a semigroup.
Theorem 4.2. Let(g(x))x≥0be a semigroup of invertible linear maps acting on Kdwith
K∈ {R,C}and letg(x) =D(x)T(x)be the multiplicative Jordan–Chevalley decomposition
of eachg(x). Then((D(x))x≥0)and(T(x))x≥0each form a semigroup, and the two families
commute with each other, i.e. T(x)D(y) =D(y)T(x)for allx,y≥0.
Proof.We can w.l.o.g. assume that K=C, since by uniqueness of the Jordan–Chevalley
decomposition D(x)∈Rd×dandT(x)∈Rd×difg(x)∈Rd×dforx≥0. Take the SPD
from Theorem 3.3, V=/circleplustextk
i=1Vi, so that each g(x) has only one eigenvalue on Vi. Denote
byg(x)|Vi=Di(x)Ti(x) the multiplicative Jordan–Chevalley decomposition g(x) restricted
toVi. Denote by λi(x) the eigenvalue of g(x) onVi. Clearly, Di(x) =λi(x)id. Since the
(gi(x))x≥0are a commuting family of matrices, they share a common eigenvecto rvi∈Vi.
We have
λi(x)λi(y)vi=gi(x)gi(y)vi=gi(x+y)vi=λi(x+y)vi,
and hence ( Di(x))x≥0is a semigroup. Since each Di(x) is a multiple of the identity, it
commutes with every linear map and hence
Ti(x)Ti(y) =1
λi(x)λi(y)gi(x)gi(y) =1
λi(x+y)gi(x+y) =Ti(x+y),
which shows that ( Ti(x))x≥0is also a semigroup. The result then follows, since by uniqueness
(/circleplustextDi(x))⊗(/circleplustextTi(x)) is the multiplicative Jordan–Chevalley decomposition of g(x).
Theorem 4.3. Let(g(x))x≥0be a semigroup of invertible linear maps acting on Vand let
g(x) =D(x)T(x)be its multiplicative Jordan–Chevalley decomposition. Th en there exist
commuting real diagonalizable linear maps J(x)and commuting real nilpotent linear maps
N(x)satisfying
1.J(x)+J(y) =J(x+y)
2.N(x)+N(y) =N(x+y)
3.J(x)N(y) =N(y)J(x)for allx,y≥0
such that
D(x) = exp(J(x)), T(x) = exp(N(x))
and
g(x) = exp(J(x)+N(x)).
Proof.LetV=/circleplustextn
i=1Vibe the SRPD and let gi(x) :=g(x)|Vi. Assume ﬁrst that Viis of ﬁrst
type and λi(x) is the single positive eigenvalue of gi(x). Then the multiplicative Jordan–
Chevalley decomposition on Viisgi(x) =λi(x)idTi(x). Deﬁne Ji(x) := log(λi(x))id. Since
Ti(x)−id is nilpotent, we have
Ni(x) := log(Ti(x)) =d−1/summationdisplay
k=11
k(id−Ti(x))k.
6Notice that since the logarithm converges for all unipotent matrice s the exponential map
between the Lie algebra of nilpotent matrices and the Lie group of un ipotent matrices is
bijective (see p. 35 in [5]). Since Ti(x) is a semigroup we have
exp(Ni(x))exp(Ni(y)) = exp( Ni(y))exp(Ni(x)) = exp( Ni(x+y)).
Rewrite this as
exp(Ni(y))−1exp(Ni(x))exp(Ni(y)) = exp/parenleftbig
exp(Ni(y))−1Ni(x)exp(Ni(y))/parenrightbig
= exp(Ni(x)).
Since exp( Ni(y))−1Ni(x)exp(Ni(y)) is nilpotent and exp is bijective we have
exp(Ni(y))−1Ni(x)exp(Ni(y)) =Ni(x).
For anyt∈RsetNt
i(x) :=tid+Ni(x).Nt
i(x) is invertible for t/ne}ationslash= 0. Clearly
Nt
i(x)exp(Ni(y)) = exp( Ni(y))Nt
i(x).
Applying the same idea again yields
exp(Nt
i(x)−1Ni(y)Nt
i(x)) = exp( Ni(y)).
Again by uniqueness we obtain
Nt
i(x)Ni(y) =Ni(y)Nt
i(x)
or equivalently
Ni(x)Ni(y) =Ni(y)Ni(x).
By commutativity we obtain
exp(Ni(x)+Ni(y)) = exp( Ni(x))exp(Ni(y)) = exp( Ni(x+y))
and hence, again by uniqueness, we have Ni(x) +Ni(y) =Ni(x+y). It follows that Ji(x)
andNi(x) satisfy the required conditions.
In the second case Viis of second type. By Theorem 3.3 and since gi(x) is real, Vi
decomposes over CasVi=U1⊕U2wheregi(x) has only one eigenvalue on each UjandU1
is isomorphic to U2with isomorphism given by u∈U1/ma√sto→u∈U2. By taking the principal
branch of the logarithm, in the same manner as in the real case we ob tain commuting J,N
onU1andJ,NonU2satisfying Cauchy’s equation such that
gi(x) = exp(J(x)+N(x))⊕exp(J(x)+N(x)).
Notice that J(x) = (µ(x)+iν(x))id, where i=√−1 andν(x) satisﬁes Cauchy’s functional
equation on R/[−π,π). By Lemma A.1, we can lift any solution on R/[−π,π) to a solution
onRsuch that linearity is preserved. From now on denote by ν(x) this lift. Hence if we
choose any basis of U1and its complex conjugate on U2we obtain that gi(x) is similar to

85 Proof of the main result
After providing some ﬁnal preparatory results, this section ends with the proof of Theo-
rem 2.6. Consider again the SRPD from Theorem 3.2. Now on each Vi,g(x) has either one
positive eigenvalue λi(x) =eµi(x)or two complex conjugate eigenvalues λi(x) =eµi(x)+iνi(x)
andλi(x) =eµi(x)−iνi(x), where it is possible that νi(x) =πfor some values of x. IfViis of
ﬁrst type, set νi(x) = 0. Each νiis a solution to Cauchy’s functional equation. Consider then
the set{f|f=νiorf=−νifor some 1 ≤i≤n}and partition it into equivalent solutions,
according to Deﬁnition A.2. This then gives a partition of the index set {1,...,n}=/uniontextk

Deﬁnition 5.1. We call the decomposition V=/circleplustextk
i=1Withe partitioned SRPD of V.
Furthermore associate with each Wjone solution ηjsuch that ηj∼νiwithi∈Ij. Ifηj
is linear we always take ηj≡0. Notice that for i/ne}ationslash=j ηi/ne}ationslash∼ηj, hence there can be at most
oneWiwithηi= 0 and furthermore this is the only Wiwhich can have odd dimension since
it contains all Vjof type 1 (recall Deﬁnition 3.4).
Theorem 5.2. Let(g(x))x≥0be a semigroup of invertible linear maps acting on Vand

In both cases Gi(x) :Wi→Wiis a commuting family of matrices on Wisatisfying Cauchy’s
functional equation. Furthermore if vis a common eigenvector of (Gi(x))x≥0such that
Gi(x)v= [µ(x)+iν(x)]v, thenνis linear in x.
Proof.Assume ﬁrst that ηi, the associated solution of Cauchy’s functional equation, is non-
continuous. For each Wiwe have the decomposition Wi=/circleplustext

By construction the common eigenvalues of exp( Gi(x)) satisfy λ(x) =eµj(x)±icjx. Ifηi≡0,
then by Theorem 4.3 there exists Gi(x) such that g(x)|Wi= exp(Gi(x)). By the deﬁnition
ofWi, it follows that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of Gi(x) have to be equivalent
toηi≡0, hence they have to be linear.
Theorem 5.3. Letgbe a non-degenerate semigroup acting on Vwhich satisﬁes Assump-

Clearly,/bardblgi(x)/bardblop≤ /bardblg(x)/bardblop≤f(x). For each eigenvalue λi(x) =eµi(x)+iνi(x)onViwe have
|λi(x)| ≤ /bardblgi(x)/bardblop≤f(x).
Sinceλi(x)λi(y) =λi(x+y), we have |λi(x)||λi(y)|=|λi(x+y)|. Moreover, µi(x) =
log(|λi(x)|), and so µi(x)≤log(f(x)) forx≥0 andµi(x) +µi(y) =µi(x+y). It follows
thatµiis locally bounded and hence that µi(x) =aixfor some ai≥0. As in the proof
of Theorem 4.3, on Viwe have gi(x) = exp( Ji(x))Ti(x) whereJi(x) is diagonalizable with
eigenvalues aix±iνi(x), and thus
/bardblTi(x)/bardblop≤f(x)e−aix.
As in Theorem 4.3, set
Ni(x) := log(Ti(x)) =d−1/summationdisplay
k=11
k(id−Ti(x))k.
10Then, since /bardblid−Ti(x)/bardblop≤1+f(x)e−aix, we obtain

whereF(x) is again locally bounded. Since the operator norm in ﬁnite dimensions is equiv-
alent to the L∞-norm, it follows that each entry of Ni(x) is locally bounded and satis-
ﬁes Cauchy’s functional equation. Thus, there exists a nilpotent lin ear map Pisuch that
Ni(x) =Pix. LetV=/circleplustextk

The real part of the eigenvalues of Jj(x) is linear in xand by Theorem 5.2 also the com-
plex parts have to be linear since νi≡0. Since Jj(x) is diagonalizable and all its eigen-
values are continuous in x,Jj(x) is continuous in xand hence Jj(x) =˜Mjx. Setting
Mi:=/circleplustext
j∈Ii(˜Mj+Pj) andSi(x) = id yields g(x)|Wi=Si(x)exp(Mix). By Theorem 5.2
and (5.1), we have for Wiwithηinon-continuous
g(x)|Wi=AiQηi
di(x)A−1
iexp(Gi(x))
with
Gi(x) =/circleplusdisplay

Hence, setting Mi:=/circleplustext

g(x)|Wi=AiQηi
di(x)A−1

Next we show that Si(x) :=AiQηi

iis an isometry on Wi. Since/bardblg(x)/bardblop≤f(x), we
have
/an}bracketle{tv,v/an}bracketri}ht−1

Fix an arbitrary x0≥0, and set θ0:=ηi(x0). The graph of ηiis dense in R×R(see
Appendix A), and so there is a sequence of positive reals xnwith lim n→∞xn= 0 such that
limηi(xn) =θ0. Then, for v∈Wiwe obtain

11where lim1
f(xn)= 1 since fis right-continuous at 0. Choose (˜ xn) such that lim˜ xn= 0 and
limηi(˜xn) =−θ0. Then, since S(x0)v∈Wi, we obtain

/an}bracketle{tv,v/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tS(x0)v,S(x0)v/an}bracketri}ht,
which implies that S(x0) is an isometry on Wi. Next we show that all Wiare pairwise
orthogonal. Let v∈Wiandu∈Wjfori/ne}ationslash=j. By Lemma A.3, there exists w.l.o.g.
a sequence ˆ xnsuch that limˆ xn= 0, lim ηi(ˆxn) =πand limηj(ˆxn) =θ∈(−π,π). Hence
limS(ˆxn)|Wi=−idandlim S(ˆxn)|Wj=AjQdj(θ)A−1
jwithθ∈(−π,π). Wehave theidentity
Qdj(φ)+Qdj(−φ) = 2cos( φ)id. Applying this to φ:=θ/2 we obtain
id+Qdj(θ) = 2cos( θ/2)Qdj(θ/2).
Hence we have (id+ Qdj(θ))−1= (2cos( θ/2))−1Qdj(−θ/2). Set ˜u:=A−1
j(id+Qdj(θ))−1Aju.
Then ˜u∈Wj, and applying (5.3) to v+ ˜uand taking the limit along ˆ xnyields
0≤ /an}bracketle{tv+ ˜u,v+ ˜u/an}bracketri}ht−/an}bracketle{tlimS(ˆxn)(v+ ˜u),limS(ˆxn)(v+ ˜u)/an}bracketri}ht

where the last equality follows from the fact that each S(ˆxn) is an isometry on WiandWj.
Since the inequality above also holds for v−˜u, we obtain the equality
0 =/an}bracketle{tv,˜u/an}bracketri}ht−/an}bracketle{tlimS(ˆxn)v,limS(ˆxn)˜u/an}bracketri}ht

j˜u/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tv,u/an}bracketri}ht.
Sincev,uwere arbitrary, this shows orthogonality. Hence the decompositio nV=/circleplustextk
i=1Wi
is orthogonal, and since Si(x) is an isometry on Wi, it follows that S(x) :=/circleplustextk
i=1Si(x) is in
SO(d). Setting M=/circleplustextk
i=1Mi, we obtain
g(x) =S(x)exp(Mx).
Corollary 5.4. Assume that S(x) =AQν
d(x)A−1is a semigroup with Abeing an invertible
matrix such that S(x)is an isometry for each x≥0. Then there exists an orthogonal matrix
Usuch that
S(x) =UQν
d(x)UT.
Proof.One can easily verify the identities S(x)+S(x)T= 2cos(ν(x))id and sin( ν(y))S(x)−
sin(ν(x))S(y) = sin(ν(x)−ν(y))id. Choose x >0 such that sin( ν(x))/ne}ationslash= 0. Such an xclearly
exists since νis linear on Qx. Choose any v∈Vof unit length and set
u:=S(x)v−cos(ν(x))v
sin(ν(x)).
12The deﬁnition of uis invariant under the choice of xas long as sin( ν(x))/ne}ationslash= 0. This can be
seen by noticing that
sin(ν(y))S(x)−sin(ν(x))S(y) = sin(ν(x)−ν(y))id
⇐⇒S(x)v−cos(ν(x))v
sin(ν(x))=S(y)v−cos(ν(y))v
sin(ν(y)).
Hence we obtain S(x)v= cos(ν(x))v+sin(ν(x))u. We have
/an}bracketle{tu,v/an}bracketri}ht=1
sin(ν(x))/an}bracketle{tS(x)v−cos(ν(x))v,v/an}bracketri}ht=1
sin(ν(x))/parenleftbig
/an}bracketle{tS(x)v,v/an}bracketri}ht−cos(ν(x))/parenrightbig
= 0,
where the last equality follows from
2/an}bracketle{tS(x)v,v/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tS(x)v,v/an}bracketri}ht+/an}bracketle{tS(x)Tv,v/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tS(x)v+S(x)Tv,v/an}bracketri}ht= 2cos(ν(x)).
Similarly we can show that uis also of unit length. Set H:= Span( u,v). Clearly, His
invariant under ( S(x))xand hence so is H⊥since each S(x)∈SO(d). In this manner we can
construct an orthonormal basis, and we denote by Uthe matrix associated with this change
of basis. Then we have
Ug(x)UT=UAS(x)A−1UTexp(UMUTx) =Qν
d(x)exp(UMUTx).
Lemma 5.5. Suppose that the semigroup g, acting on V, satisﬁes Assumption 2.5. Let
V=V1⊕V2be the decomposition of Corollary 3.8 such that g|V1is invertible. Then, for any
v∈V1we have
lim
x→0/bardblg(x)v/bardbl
/bardblv/bardbl= 1.
Proof.By Theorem 5.3, we have g(x)|V1=S(x)exp(Mx). SinceS(x)∈SO(V1), we obtain
/an}bracketle{tg(x)v,g(x)v/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{texp(Mx)v,exp(Mx)/an}bracketri}ht, v∈V1,
which is continuous in x. Hence
lim
x→0/bardblg(x)v/bardbl= lim
x→0/bardblexp(Mx)v/bardbl=/bardblv/bardbl.
Corollary 5.6. Suppose that the semigroup g, acting on V, satisﬁes Assumption 2.5. Then
the decomposition from Corollary 3.8 is orthogonal.
Proof.LetV=V1⊕V2withg(x)|V1being non-degenerate and g(x)|V2≡0. Assume V1is
not orthogonal to V2. Then there exists v∈V1such that pV2(v)/ne}ationslash= 0, where pV2denotes the
orthogonal projection onto V2. By Lemma 5.5, we have
lim
x→0/bardblg(x)v/bardbl
/bardblv/bardbl= 1.
Calculating the same limit for v−pV2(v) we obtain
lim
x→0/bardblg(x)(v−pV2(v))/bardbl
/bardblv−pV2(v)/bardbl= lim
x→0/bardblg(x)v/bardbl
/bardblv/bardbl/bardblv/bardbl
/bardblv−pV2(v)/bardbl=/bardblv/bardbl
/bardblv−pV2(v)/bardbl.
13Since/bardblv/bardbl2=/bardblv−pV2(v)/bardbl2+/bardblpV2(v)/bardbl2and/bardblpV2(v)/bardbl /ne}ationslash= 0, we have/bardblv/bardbl
/bardblv−pV2(v)/bardbl>1. Hence
lim
x→0/bardblg(x)(v−pV2(v))/bardbl
/bardblv−pV2(v)/bardbl>1,
but this contradicts /bardblg(x)/bardblop≤f(x). Hence V1⊥V2.
Proof of Theorem 2.6. By Corollary 5.6, we have the orthogonal decomposition V=˜V1⊕˜V2
withg(x)|˜V2≡0 andg(x)|˜V1non-degenerate. Applying Theorem 5.3 to g(x)|˜V1yields the
result.
A Cauchy’s functional equation
It is classical that all continuous solutions of the equation (1.3), f(x)+f(y) =f(x+y), are
linear, and that the non-linear solutions are not continuous, even n ot Lebesgue measurable,
and have dense graphs. For this, and further references, we re fer to [2, Section 1.1]. In
this section, we provide two auxiliary results on Cauchy’s equation. T hey concern lifting
solutions from an interval to the real line, resp. the joint behavior of two solutions that diﬀer
by a non-linear function.
Lemma A.1. Letf:R→R/[−a,a)be a solution to Cauchy’s functional equation (1.3)
onR/[−a,a)witha >0. Then there exists a solution ˜f:R→Rof Cauchy’s functional
equation such that f(x)≡˜f(x) mod [−a,a). The solution ˜fis linear if and only if fis
linear.
Proof.Take a Hamel basis ( ri)i∈IofRsuch that ri∈[−a,a) for every i∈I. This is clearly
possible by rescaling every basis element if necessary. For any x∈Rthere exists a ﬁnite
subsetIx⊂Iandci∈Qsuch that x=/summationtext
i∈Ixciri. Set˜f(x) =/summationtext
i∈Ixcif(ri), then clearly
f(x)≡˜f(x) mod [−a,a). Iffis linear then clearly ˜fis linear as well. If fis not linear
then there exist two basis elements r1andr2such that f(r1)−r1
r2f(r2)/ne}ationslash= 0, and hence ˜fis
also not linear.
Deﬁnition A.2. We say that two solutions νandηof Cauchy’s functional equation are
equivalent if ν−ηis linear.
Lemma A.3. Letf,g:R→Rbe two non-equivalent solutions of Cauchy’s functional
equation. Then there exists a sequence (xn)n≥0inR≥0, converging to 0, such that either
limnf(xn) =πandlimng(xn) =θwith|θ|< πor vice versa.
Proof.Choosex,y∈R>0suchthatthetwovectors v1= (x,f(x),g(x))andv2= (y,f(y),g(y))
are linearly independent andf(x)
x−f(y)
y/ne}ationslash=g(x)
x−g(y)
y. This is possible, since
f(x)
x−f(y)
y=g(x)
x−g(y)
y
for allx,y >0 would imply that f−gis linear. Assume w.l.o.g. that/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef(x)

y/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle>/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg(x)
x−g(y)
y/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. Sincefandgare both linear on QxandQyandv1andv2are linearly in-
dependent, there exist sequences qn∈Qandrn∈Qsuch that qnx−rny≥0 for every
14n, limqnx−rny= 0 and lim nf(qnx−rny) = lim nqnf(x)−rnf(y) =π. We show that
xn=qnx−rnyhas the required property. Clearly limrn
