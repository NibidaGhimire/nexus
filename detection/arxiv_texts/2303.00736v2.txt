Abstract
We develop the concept of twisted ambidexterity in a paramet rized presentably symmetric
monoidal ∞-category, which generalizes the notion of ambidexterity b y Hopkins and Lurie and
the Wirthm¨ uller isomorphisms in equivariant stable homot opy theory, and is closely related to
Costenoble-Waner duality. Our main result establishes the parametrized ∞-category of genuine
G-spectra for a compact Lie group Gas the universal example of a presentably symmetric
monoidal ∞-category parametrized over G-spaces which is both stable and satisﬁes twisted
ambidexterity for compact G-spaces. We further extend this result to the settings of orb ispectra
and proper genuine G-spectra for a Lie group Gwhich is not necessarily compact.
1 Introduction
A well-known phenomenon in representation theory, sometimes ref erred to as ambidexterity , is
that ifHis a subgroup of a ﬁnite group G, the restriction functor from G-representations to H-
representations admits a left adjoint indG
Hand a right adjoint coindG
Hwhich are naturally equivalent
to each other. An analogue of this result in stable equivariant homot opy theory was established by
Wirthm¨ uller [ Wir74]: there is an equivalence indG
H≃coindG
Hbetween the induction and coinduction
functors from genuine H-spectra to genuine G-spectra.
The situation becomes more interesting when Gis a non-discrete compact Lie group. For a closed
subgroup H/lessorequalslantG, the induction and coinduction functors are only equivalent up to a ‘t wist’: for
every genuine H-spectrum Xthere is a natural equivalence of genuine G-spectra
indG
H(X⊗S−L)∼−−→coindG
H(X),
called the Wirthm¨ uller isomorphism , whereS−Lis the inverse of the representation sphere of the
tangentH-representation L=TeH(G/H). The construction of the comparison map in this case is
geometric in nature and therefore substantially more involved than in the case of ﬁnite groups, see
for example Schwede [ Sch18, Section 3.2]. As a result, it is not immediately clear how to extend
it to more general settings, like that of proper equivariant homoto py theory [ DHL+23] or that of
orbispectra [ Par23], where some of the required geometric constructions are not ava ilable.
In [MS06], May and Sigurdsson approach the Wirthm¨ uller isomorphism using th e language of
parametrized homotopy theory . They split up the construction of the isomorphism into two steps:
(1) The ﬁrst step is formal: inspired by workof Costenoble and Wane r [CW16], May and Sigurdsson
set up a notion of parametrized duality theory called Costenoble-Waner duality . This theory
1provides an entirely categorical construction of a genuine H-spectrum DG/Hequipped with a
natural transformation
indG
H(−⊗DG/H) =⇒coindG
H(−).
This transformation is an equivalence if and only if SHisCostenoble-Waner dualizable , in which
case its Costenoble-Waner dual is given by DG/H.
(2) The second step is geometric: May and Sigurdsson use a parame trized form of the Pontryagin-
Thom construction to produce explicit duality data that exhibit the g enuineH-spectrum S−L
as Costenoble-Waner dual to SH. As a consequence, one obtains an equivalence DG/H≃S−L
and the resulting map indG
H(X⊗S−L)→coindG
H(X) is an equivalence.
A key advantage of separating the construction into these two st eps is that the ﬁrst step does not
need any geometric input and works in much greater generality: it is a n instance of a notion we call
twisted ambidexterity . This allows for the construction of similar transformations in a wider range
of contexts, including proper equivariant homotopy theory. It fu rther allows one to formulate the
Wirthm¨ uller isomorphisms as a property of a parametrized homotopy theory, making it possible to
talk about the universal example of a parametrized homotopy theo ry satisfying this property.
Twisted ambidexterity in parametrized homotopy theory
The concept of twisted ambidexterity comes up in homotopy theory in the setting of local systems
on spaces. For a space A, let SpAdenote the functor category Fun( A,Sp), also known as the ∞-
category of local systems of spectra on A. The constant local system functor A∗: Sp→SpAadmits
both a left adjoint A!= colim A: SpA→Sp as well as a right adjoint A∗= lim A: SpA→Sp.
Although A∗does not preserve colimits in general, it can be universally approximat ed from the left
by a colimit-preserving functor via a twisted norm map
NmA:A!(−⊗DA) =⇒A∗(−),
as shown by Nikolaus and Scholze [ NS18, Theorem I.4.1(v)]. The parametrized spectrum DA∈SpA
is thedualizing spectrum of A, introduced and studied by John Klein [ Kle01].1In caseAis a
compact space, the functor A∗already preserves colimits, and the twisted norm map Nm Ais an
equivalence. When A=Mis a compact smooth manifold, DM=S−TMis the inverse of the
one-point-compactiﬁcation of the tangent bundle of M, and the resulting equivalence between the
cohomology of Mand a shift of the homology of Mrecovers twisted Poincar´ e duality.
In this article, we introduce a frameworkfor twisted ambidexterity which generalizesthe above story
for local systems of spectra in two ways. As a ﬁrst generalization, we replace the∞-categoryof spec-
tra by an arbitrary presentably symmetric monoidal ∞-categoryC, in which case the transformation
A!(−⊗DA):CA→Cis the universalC-linear colimit-preserving approximation of A∗:CA→C. As
a second generalization, following Ando, Blumberg and Gepner [ ABG18], we consider homotopy
theories parametrized over an arbitrary ∞-toposBin place of the∞-category of spaces, allowing for
applications in equivariant homotopy theory. The role of Cis now played by certain limit-preserving
functorsC:Bop→CAlg(PrL) known as presentably symmetric monoidal B-categories , see Deﬁni-
tion2.15. Given an object A∈B, one can enhance A!andA∗toparametrized functorsCA→C, and
1Klein considered connected spaces A=BGfor topological groups G, and wrote DGrather than DBG.
2one can again construct an object DA∈C(A) and a twisted norm map Nm A:A!(−⊗DA)→A∗uni-
versally approximating A∗by aC-linear colimit-preserving parametrized functor; see Proposition 3.7
for a precise statement. If Nm Ais an equivalence, we will say that AistwistedC-ambidextrous .

see Proposition 3.16.

Twisted ambidexterity in equivariant homotopy theory
The Wirthm¨ uller isomorphism in equivariant homotopy theory discuss ed before may be understood
as a special case of twisted ambidexterity. Given a compact Lie grou pG, we work in the setting
ofG-categories , deﬁned as∞-categories parametrized over the ∞-topos of G-spaces. There is a G-
categorySpGofgenuine G-spectra,whichassignstotheorbitspace G/Hofaclosedsubgroup H/lessorequalslantG
the∞-categoryofgenuine H-spectra. The G-categorySpGispresentablysymmetricmonoidalandis
ﬁberwise stable, meaning that the ∞-categorySpG(A) is stable for every G-spaceA. Furthermore, it
follows from results of [ MS06] that every compact G-space is twisted SpG-ambidextrous in the sense
discussed above. The main result of this article is that SpGis in fact universal amongG-categories
satisfying the above properties:
Theorem A (Theorem 4.9).For a compact Lie group G, theG-category SpGis initial among
ﬁberwise stable presentably symmetric monoidal G-categoriesCsuch that all compact G-spaces are
twistedC-ambidextrous.
In fact, it suﬃces to require that the orbit G/His twisted ambidextrous for every closed subgroup
H/lessorequalslantG. In this case, the resulting twisted ambidexterity isomorphism spec ializes to a formal
Wirthm¨ uller isomorphism of the form
NmG/H: indG
H(−⊗DG/H)∼−−→coindG
H(−).
Therefore, Theorem Amay be interpreted as saying that genuine equivariant spectra for m the
universal theory of stable G-equivariant objects which admit formal Wirthm¨ uller isomorphisms.
For the proof of Theorem A, we relate twisted ambidexterity for compact G-spaces to invertibility of
representation spheres. If Cis a pointed presentably symmetric monoidal G-category, one can show
that the underlying ∞-categoryC(1) ofCcomes equipped with a canonical tensoring by pointed
G-spaces, and thus the representation spheres SVact onC(1).
Theorem B (Theorem 4.8).LetGbe a compact Lie group and let Cbe a ﬁberwise stable presentably
symmetric monoidal G-category. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) For any G-representation V, the representation sphere SVacts invertibly on C(1);
(2) Every compact G-space is twistedC-ambidextrous;
(3) For every closed subgroup H/lessorequalslantG, the orbit G/His twistedC-ambidextrous.
3SinceSpGisinitialwithrespecttocondition(1), Theorem AisasadirectconsequenceofTheorem B.
For the proof of Theorem B, we show in Section 3.3that twisted ambidexterity can be formulated in
terms of Costenoble-Waner duality , a parametrized form of duality theory. The main ingredient for
the implication (1) = ⇒(2) is then a result of May and Sigurdsson [ MS06] about Costenoble-Waner
duality in equivariant stable homotopy theory. The main ingredient fo r the implication (2) = ⇒
(1) is a result of Campion [ Cam23], recalled in Appendix B, which roughly says that dualizability
of compact G-spaces implies invertibility of the representation spheres.
Our methods directly extend to the contexts of orbispectra andproper genuine G-spectra. We refer
to Section 4.3and Section 4.4for precise deﬁnitions of the words appearing in the following two
theorems:
Theorem C (Theorem 4.21).The orbicategory OrbSpof orbispectra is initial among ﬁberwise
stable presentably symmetric monoidal orbicategories Csuch that every relatively compact morphism
of orbispaces is twisted C-ambidextrous.
Theorem D (Theorem 4.30).For a Lie group Gwhich is not necessarily compact, the proper G-
category SpGof proper G-spectra is initial among ﬁberwise stable presentably symm etric monoidal
properG-categoriesCsuch that every relatively compact morphisms of proper G-spaces is twisted
C-ambidextrous.
In particular, Theorem Dshows that for every closed subgroup Hof a Lie group Gwith compact
orbit space G/Hthere is a formal Wirthm¨ uller isomorphism
NmG/H: indG
H(−⊗DG/H) =⇒coindG
H(−).
The methods developed in this article also allow us to give a formal desc ription of the∞-category
of proper genuine G-spectra of Degrijse et al. [ DHL+23] in case the Lie group Ghasenough bundle
representations in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.31: it is obtained from the ∞-category of pointed proper
G-spaces by inverting the sphere bundles Sξassociated to ﬁnite-dimensional vector bundles ξover
the classifying orbispace BG, see Corollary 4.35.
Organization
In Section 2, we introduce the setting of parametrized higher category theor y we will use in this
article. Several foundational deﬁnitions and results from [ Mar21,MW21,MW22] are recalled in
Section2.1. In Section 2.2, we provide for every parametrized presentably symmetric monoid al
∞-categoryCa classiﬁcation of C-linear functorsCA→CBin terms of objects of C(A×B), where
AandBare objects of the base ∞-topos. Section 2.3contains a discussion of formally inverting
objects in parametrized symmetric monoidal ∞-categories.
In Section 3, we introduce the notion of twisted ambidexterity in a parametrized presentably sym-
metric monoidal∞-categoryC. The twisted norm maps Nm f:f!(−⊗Df)⇒f∗(−) for a morphism
f:A→Bin the base∞-topos are constructed in Section 3.1, where also their universal property is
established. In Section 3.2, we relate twisted ambidexterity to the notion of ambidexterity by [ HL13]
and to the notion of parametrized semiadditivity by [ Nar16,CLL23]. In Section 3.3we discuss the
relation between twisted ambidexterity and Costenoble-Waner dua lity.
In Section 4, we apply our methods in the context of equivariant homotopy theo ry. Section 4.1
introduces the parametrized ∞-category of genuine G-spectra for a compact Lie group G, and
4Section4.2establishes its universal property in terms of twisted ambidexterit y. In Section 4.3and
Section4.4we extend this to the contexts oforbispectraand properequivar iantspectra, respectively.
Relation to other work
Our treatment of twisted ambidexterity draws on ideas from a wide r ange of prior work. The
main inspiration is the concept of Costenoble-Waner duality in parame trized homotopy theory,
introduced by Costenoble and Waner [ CW16] under the name ‘homological duality’ and further
developed by May and Sigurdsson [ MS06]. The untwisted notion of ambidexterity appeared in the
works of Hopkins and Lurie [ HL13] and has been further studied by Harpaz [ Har20] and Carmeli,
Schlank and Yanovski [ CSY22,CSY21]. A treatment in the context of representation theory was
given by Balmer and Dell’Ambrogio [ BD20]. In the case of local systems on spaces, the universal
propertyofthe twisted norm map resemblesclassicalassemblymap s; see, forexample, the discussion
following Theorem I.4.1 of Nikolaus and Scholze [ NS18]. The dualizing object in this case is the
dualizing spectrum introduced by Klein [ Kle01] and studied by Bauer [ Bau04] and Rognes [ Rog08].
A parametrized version of the assembly map was ﬁrst introduced by Quigley and Shah [ QS21]
for equivariant genuine spectra. Other sources of inspiration are the ‘ambidexterity isomorphisms’
of Hoyois [ Hoy17] and Bachmann and Hoyois [ BH21], and the ‘purity equivalences’ of Cisinski
and D´ eglise [ CD19]. Although similar in appearance, our approach is diﬀerent from the f ormal
Wirthm¨ uller isomorphisms of Fausk, Hu and May [ FHM03] and Balmer, Dell’Ambrogio and Sanders
[BDS16], where no parametrized homotopy theory is involved.
Our characterizationof genuine equivariant spectra in terms of ﬁb erwise stability and formal Wirth-
m¨ uller isomorphisms is heavily inspired by work of Blumberg [ Blu06], who described the cate-
gory of genuine G-spectra for a compact Lie group Gin terms of continuous functors that sat-
isfy excision and have (geometrically deﬁned) Wirthm¨ uller isomorphis ms. For ﬁnite groups, a
parametrized universal property for genuine G-spectra in terms of stability and Wirthm¨ uller equiv-
alences indG
H(−)≃coindG
H(−) was outlined by Nardin [ Nar16], and a similar result in the context
of global homotopy theory was proved by Lenz, Linskens and the a uthor in [ CLL23].

52 Parametrized category theory
We start by recalling the setup of parametrized category theory w e are working in, and establishing
some analogues of well-known results in non-parametrized categor y theory. Our main references are
the articles[ Mar21], [MW21] and [MW22] of Martini and Wolf; see in particular[ MW22, Section 2.6]
for a short overview of the theory. An earlier framework for para metrized category theory was given
by Barwick, Dotto, Glasman, Nardin and Shah [ BDG+16a,BDG+16b,Sha23,Nar16].
Convention 2.1. Since most of the ∞-categories we will be working with are presentable, we will
by convention take all ∞-categories to be large unless explicitly speciﬁed that they are small. In
particular, Cat ∞denotes the (very large) ∞-category of large ∞-categories; in [ MW22], this is
denoted by /hatwidestCat∞instead.
2.1 Recollections on parametrized category theory
Throughout this section, we ﬁx an ∞-toposB.
Deﬁnition 2.2. AB-category is a sheaf of∞-categoriesonB, i.e., a limit-preserving functor Bop→
Cat∞. Itsunderlying∞-category Γ(C) is the∞-categoryC(1), where 1∈Bis the terminal object.
Given twoB-categoriesCandD, aB-functor is a natural transformation C→D. We let Cat(B)⊆
Fun(Bop,Cat∞) denote the (very large) ∞-category ofB-categories andB-functors.
By [Mar21, Proposition 3.5.1], a B-category may equivalently be encoded as a (large) category
internal toB, which is the perspective used in [ Mar21,MW21,MW22].
WhenBis the∞-topos Spc of spaces (a.k.a. ∞-groupoids or animae), the underlying category
functor provides an equivalence
Γ: Cat(Spc)≃−−→Cat∞;
its inverse sends an ∞-categoryCto the functor Spcop→Cat∞:A/m⊣psto→Fun(A,C). More generally,
whenB= PSh(T) is the∞-topos of presheaves on some small ∞-category T, restriction to the
representable objects induces an equivalence Cat(PSh( T))∼−−→Fun(Top,Cat∞), and the theory of
B-categories reduces to that of T-∞-categories studied by Barwick et al. [ BDG+16b]. Since all the
examples of∞-topoi considered in this article will be presheaf topoi, the reader u ncomfortable with
the language of∞-topoi may replace Bby PSh(T) throughout.
Example 2.3 (B-groupoids) .Every object A∈Bcan naturally be regarded as a B-category via
the Yoneda embedding B֒→FunR(Bop,Spc)⊆FunR(Bop,Cat∞). TheB-categories of this form are
calledB-groupoids .
Example 2.4 (Base change) .Any geometric morphism f∗:A⇄B:f∗induces an adjunction
f∗: Cat(A)⇄Cat(B) :f∗, see [Mar21, Section 3.3], [ MW21, Section 2.6]. The right adjoint f∗is
explicitly given by precomposing a B-categoryC:Bop→Cat∞withf∗:Aop→Bop.
Example 2.5 (Locally constant B-categories) .Applying Example 2.4to the geometric morphism
LConst: Spc ⇄B:Γ, we obtain an adjunction LConst: Cat ∞⇄Cat(B) :Γ, where Γ is the under-
lying∞-category functor. The B-categories in the image of LConst are called locally constant .2
2In [MW21] these are simply called constant .
6Example 2.6 (Passing to slice topoi) .For an object B∈B, applying Example 2.4to the ´ etale
geometric morphism −×B=π∗
B:B⇄B/B:(πB)∗, we get an adjunction
π∗
B: Cat(B)⇄Cat(B/B) :(πB)∗.
ForC ∈Cat(B), theB/B-category π∗
BCis given by precomposing Cwith the forgetful functor
B/B→B, as this is a left adjoint to −×B:B→B /B.
Example 2.7 (Parametrized functor categories) .By [Mar21, Proposition 3.2.11], the ∞-category
Cat(B) ofB-categories is cartesian closed: for all C,D∈Cat(B) there is an internal hom-object3
FunB(C,D), called theB-category ofB-functors fromCtoD. We let Fun B(C,D) denote the under-
lying∞-category of FunB(C,D). Its morphisms are called B-transformations .
Deﬁnition 2.8. Asymmetric monoidal B-category is a commutative monoid in the ∞-category
Cat(B), or equivalently a limit-preserving functor C:Bop→CMon(Cat ∞). ForB∈B, we denote
the tensor product and monoidal unit of C(B) by−⊗B−and1B, respectively.
PresentableB-categories
We give a brief overview of the theory of presentable B-categories, developed by Martini and Wolf
[MW22].
Deﬁnition 2.9. AB-categoryC:Bop→Cat∞iscalledﬁberwise presentable ifit factors(necessarily
uniquely) through the subcategory PrL⊆Cat∞of presentable∞-categories and colimit preserving
functors. We say that Cispresentable if it is ﬁberwise presentable and additionally satisﬁes the
following two conditions:
(1) (Left adjoints) For every morphism f:A→BinB, the restriction functor f∗:C(B)→C(A)
has a left adjoint f!:C(A)→C(B);
(2) (Left base change) For every pullback square
A′A
B′Bα
f′f
β
inB, the Beck-Chevalley transformation f′
!α∗⇒β∗f!is an equivalence.
IfCandDare presentableB-categories, we say that a B-functor F:C→Dpreserves (parametrized)
colimits if the following two properties are satisﬁed:
(1) For every object B∈B, the functor F(B):C(B)→D(B) preserves small colimits;
(2) For every morphism f:A→BinB, the Beck-Chevalley transformation f!◦F(A) =⇒F(B)◦f!
is an equivalence.
3Martini [ Mar21] denotes FunB(C,D) by [C,D].
7By [MW22, Theorem A] and [ MW21, Proposition 4.2.3], these deﬁnitions agree with the deﬁnitions
of Martini and Wolf [ MW22].
Remark 2.10. For a presentable B-category, the restriction functor f∗:C(B)→C(A) is assumed
to admit a right adjoint f∗:C(A)→C(B) for every morphism f:A→B. By passing to right
adjoints in condition (2) in Deﬁnition 2.9, we see that also the other Beck-Chevalley transformation
β∗f∗⇒f′∗α∗isanequivalence. It followsthat anypresentable B-categoryadmitsall(parametrized)
limits and colimits.
The next deﬁnition introduces the presentable B-category Ω B, theB-parametrized analogue of the
∞-category of spaces.
Deﬁnition 2.11. The target functor d0:B∆1→Bis a cartesian ﬁbration, and by [ Lur09, Theorem
6.1.3.9] is classiﬁed by a limit-preserving functor
ΩB:Bop→PrL, B/m⊣psto→B/B,(f:A→B)/m⊣psto→(f∗:B/B→B/A).
The pullback functors f∗:B/B→B/Ahave left adjoints f◦−:B/A→B/Bwhich satisfy the Beck-
Chevalley condition, so Ω Bis a presentableB-category. We call Ω BtheB-category ofB-groupoids .4
Remark. WhenB= PSh(T) is a presheaf topos, the B-category Ω Bcorresponds to the T-category
SpcTfrom [Sha23] and [CLL23, Example 2.1.11].
Deﬁnition 2.12. Let PrL(B) denote the (non-full) subcategory of Cat( B) spanned by the pre-
sentableB-categories and the colimit preserving B-functors. For presentable B-categoriesCandD,
we let FunL
B(C,D) denote the subcategory of Fun B(C,D) spanned by those B-functorsC→Dthat
preserve colimits.
Recall from [ MW21, Deﬁnition 2.7.2] that the ∞-categoriesCat(B/B) assemble into a (very large) B-
category Cat B. The subcategories PrL(B/B)⊆Cat(B/B) assemble into a parametrized subcategory
PrL
B⊆CatB, see [MW22, Deﬁnition 6.4.1].
Proposition 2.13 ([MW21, Proposition 4.5.1], [ MW22, Deﬁnition 6.4.1, Remark 6.4.2, Corol-
lary 6.4.11]) .TheB-categories CatBandPrL
Bare complete and cocomplete, and the inclusion PrL
B֒→
CatBpreserves limits.
Corollary 2.14. For each B∈Bthe adjunction π∗
B: Cat(B)⇄Cat(B/B) :(πB)∗from Example 2.6
restricts to an adjunction π∗
B: PrL(B)⇄PrL(B/B) :(πB)∗.
Proof.The functor π∗
B: Cat(B)→Cat(B/B) restricts to presentable categories since PrL
B⊆CatB
is a parametrized subcategory. The adjunction π∗
B⊣(πB)∗restricts to presentable categories since
the parametrized subcategory PrL
B⊆CatBis closed under (parametrized) limits.
Tensor products of presentable B-categories
Given two presentable B-categoriesCandD, there exists a presentable B-categoryC⊗Dcalled
thetensor product ofCandD, which is characterized by the property that colimit-preserving B-
functors into a third presentable B-categoryEcorrespond toB-functorsC×D→E which preserve
4It is called the universe for groupoids by Martini [ Mar21].
8colimits in both variables, see [ MW22, Section 8.2]. The tensor product equips PrL(B) with the
structure of a symmetric monoidal ∞-category PrL(B)⊗whose monoidal unit is Ω B. In fact, in
[MW22, Proposition 8.2.9] it is shown that a parametrized version of this con struction equips the
(very large)B-category PrL
Bof presentableB-categories with the structure of a symmetric monoidal
B-category. In particular, the restriction functor π∗
B: PrL(B)→PrL(B/B) is symmetric monoidal
for every object B∈B.
By [MW22, Proposition 8.2.11], a formula for the tensor product of two prese ntableB-categoriesC
andDis given byC⊗D≃ FunR
B(Cop,D), the full sub-B-category of FunB(Cop,D) spanned by the
limit-preservingB-functorsCop→D. For a third presentable B-categoryE, there is an equivalence
FunL
B(C⊗D,E)≃FunL
B(C,FunL
B(D,E)),
and it follows in particular that the B-functorC⊗−: PrL
B→PrL
Bpreserves colimits.
Deﬁnition 2.15 ([MW22, Deﬁnition 8.2.10]) .Apresentably symmetric monoidal B-category is a
commutative algebra object in the symmetric monoidal ∞-category PrL(B)⊗.
As PrL(B)⊗is a subcategory of Cat( B)×, a symmetric monoidal B-categoryCis presentably sym-
metric monoidal if and only if Cis presentable and the tensor product B-functor−⊗−:C×C→C
preserves colimits in both variables. Unwinding deﬁnitions, this boils do wn to the following two
non-parametrized conditions:
(1) (Fiberwise presentably symmetric monoidal) For every B∈B, the tensor product functor −⊗B
−:C(B)×C(B)→C(B) ofC(B) preserves small colimits in both variables.
(2) (Left projection formula) For every morphism f:A→BinBand all objects X∈C(B) and
Y∈C(A), the exchange morphism f!(f∗(X)⊗AY)→X⊗Bf!(Y) is an equivalence.
In particular, the dataofa presentablysymmetric monoidal B-categoryis the same asthat ofa limit-
preserving functor C:Bop→CAlg(PrL) such that all the symmetric monoidal restriction functors
f∗:C(B)→C(A) admit left adjoints that satisfy base change and satisfy the left p rojection formula.
Such structure has also been called a Wirthm¨ uller context5[ABG18, Deﬁnition 6.7, Proposition 6.8]
or apresentable pullback formalism [DG22, Deﬁnition 4.5].
EmbeddingB-modules into presentable B-categories
The∞-toposBcomes equipped with a presentably symmetric monoidal structure g iven by cartesian
product, and thus we may consider left modules over it in PrL, which we will refer to as B-modules .
It was shown in [ MW22, Section 8.3] that the B-modules embed fully faithfully into presentable
B-categories:
Proposition 2.16 ([MW22, Proposition 8.3.2, Lemma 8.3.3, Proposition 8.3.5, Proposition 8.3.6]) .
There is a symmetric monoidal fully faithful functor
−⊗BΩB: ModB(PrL)֒−−→PrL(B)
which admits a right adjoint Γlin: PrL(B)→ModB(PrL)whose composition with the forgetful functor
ModB(PrL)→PrLis the global section functor Γ: PrL(B)→PrL.
5In [ABG18], the Beck-Chevalley conditions and the left projection fo rmula were not taken as part of the axioms.
9Given aB-moduleD, the presentableB-categoryD⊗BΩBis given at an object B∈Bby the relative
tensor productD⊗BB/Bin PrL. The functoriality of this expression in Bis informally described
as follows: given a morphism f:A→BinB, one considers the composition functor f!:B/A→B/B
as aB-linear functor in PrL, tensors it with DoverBto get a mapD⊗BB/A→D⊗ BB/B, and
then passes to its right adjoint. We refer to [ MW22, Section 8.3] for a precise construction.
It follows directly from Proposition 2.16that every commutative B-algebraDin PrLgives rise to a
presentably symmetric monoidal B-categoryD⊗BΩB:
Corollary 2.17. The adjunction from Proposition 2.16induces an adjunction
−⊗BΩB: CAlgB(PrL) CAlg(PrL(B)) :Γlin.
We will also need a C-linear version of this result:
Lemma 2.18. For every presentably symmetric monoidal B-categoryC, the adjunction from Propo-
sition2.16induces an adjunction
−⊗Γ(C)C: ModΓ(C)(PrL)⇄ModC(PrL(B)) :ΓC.
Furthermore:
(1) the left adjoint −⊗Γ(C)Cis fully faithful and symmetric monoidal;
(2) the right adjoint ΓCpreserves colimits and satisﬁes the projection formula: th e canonical map
D⊗Γ(C)ΓC(E)→ΓC((D⊗Γ(C)C)⊗CE)
is an equivalence for every Γ(C)-moduleDandC-moduleE.
Proof.The adjunction is obtained as a concatenation of the following two ad junctions:
ModΓ(C)(PrL) Mod Γ(C)⊗BΩB(PrL(B)) Mod C(PrL(B).−⊗BΩB
Γlin−⊗Γ(C)⊗BΩBC
fgt
The ﬁrst adjunction is an instance of [ Lur17, Example 7.3.2.8] while the second adjunction is the
base change adjunction of the counit map Γ( C)⊗BΩB→C. As both left adjoints are symmetric
monoidal, so is their composite −⊗CΓ(C).
To show that the functor ΓC: ModC(PrL(B))→ModΓ(C)(PrL) preserves colimits, it suﬃces to show
that the functor Γ: PrL(B)→PrLpreserves colimits, as colimits in module categories are computed
underlying. As PrL(B)≃(PrR(B))opby [MW22, Proposition 6.4.7], we may pass to opposite cate-
gories and instead show that ΓR: PrR(B)→PrRpreserves limits. By [ MW22, Proposition 6.4.10]
the inclusion PrR(B)֒→Cat(B) preserveslimits, hence it suﬃces to show that the evaluation func tor
Γ = ev 1: Cat(B)→Cat∞preserves limits. This is clear, as limits in Cat( B) = FunR(Bop,Cat∞)
are computed pointwise.
We next show that the functor ΓCsatisﬁes the projection formula. Recall that this is automatic
wheneverDis dualizable in Mod Γ(C)(PrL), see for example [ FHM03, Proposition 3.12] or [ CCRY22 ,
Lemma 4.15]. Since we already showed that ΓCcommutes with colimits, it will suﬃce to show
10that the∞-category Mod Γ(C)(PrL) is generated under colimits by dualizable objects. Since the free
Γ(C)-module functor Γ( C)⊗−: PrL→ModΓ(C)(PrL) is symmetric monoidal and its image generates
ModΓ(C)(PrL) under colimits, it suﬃces to show that PrLis generated under colimits by dualizable
objects. This holds by [ RS22, Lemma 7.14].
Finally, we show that the left adjoint −⊗Γ(C)Cis fully faithful, or equivalently that the unit
D→ΓC(D⊗Γ(C)C) of the adjunction is an equivalence. This is a special case of the pro jection
formula applied to E=C.
For generalC-modulesDandEin PrL(B), it is not clear in general how the parametrized relative
tensor productD⊗CElooks like. The situation improves when Dcomes from a Γ(C)-module in PrL:
Corollary 2.19. LetC∈CAlg(PrL(B)), letD,E∈ModC(PrL), and assume that D=D0⊗Γ(C)Cfor
someD0∈ModΓ(C)(PrL). Then there is for every A∈Ban equivalence of C(A)-linear∞-categories
D(A)⊗C(A)E(A)∼−−→(D⊗CE)(A).
Proof.By passing to the slice category B/A, we may assume that Ais terminal inB. In this case,
Lemma2.18provides equivalences of Γ( C)-linear∞-categories
D(1)⊗C(1)E(1) = ΓC(D)⊗Γ(C)ΓC(E)∼← −D0⊗Γ(C)ΓC(E)∼− →ΓC(D⊗CE) = (D⊗CE)(1).
2.2 Classiﬁcation of C-linear functors
Given a presentably symmetric monoidal B-categoryC∈CAlg(PrL(B)), one may deﬁne for every
objectA∈Ba presentableB-categoryCAgiven byCA(B) =C(A×B). It comes equipped with
a natural tensoring over Cin PrL(B). The goal of this section is to give a classiﬁcation of C-linear
B-functors F:CA→CBfor objects A,B∈B: we will show in Theorem 2.32below that evaluation
at the object ∆ !1A∈C(A×A) =CA(A) determines an equivalence
ev∆!1: FunC(CA,CB)∼− →C(A×B),
whose inverse sends an object D∈C(A×B) to theB-functor (prB)!(pr∗
A(−)⊗D):CA→CB.
TheB-category ofC-linearB-categories
Fix a presentably symmetric monoidal B-categoryC∈CAlg(PrL(B)), and consider the ∞-category
ModC(PrL(B)) of leftC-modules in PrL(B). We refer to the objects of Mod C(PrL(B)) asC-linear
B-categories and to the morphisms as C-linearB-functors . In particular,C-linearB-functors will
always preserve colimits by convention.
For any object B∈B, we obtain an object π∗
BC∈CAlg(PrL(B/B)). By [MW22, Deﬁnition 7.2.2],
the∞-categories Mod π∗
BC(PrL(B/B)) assemble into a B-category Mod C(PrL
B). By [MW22, Proposi-
tion 7.2.7], we have:
(1) TheB-category Mod C(PrL
B) is complete and cocomplete;
(2) TheB-functor Mod C(PrL
B)→PrL
Bpreserves limits and colimits;
11(3) The relative tensor product −⊗C−: ModC(PrL
B)×ModC(PrL
B)→ModC(PrL
B) preserves colimits
in both variables.
Since PrL(B) is closed symmetric monoidal, so is Mod C(PrL(B)): for every pair of C-linearB-
categoriesDandE, there exists an internal hom object FunC(D,E). We let Fun C(D,E) denote its
underlying∞-category, whose objects are the C-linearB-functors F:D→E, and whose morphisms
will be referred to as C-linear natural transformations . Given twoC-linearB-functors F,F′:D→E,
we let Nat C(F,F′) denote the mapping space from FtoF′in Fun C(D,E).
Deﬁnition 2.20. AC-linearB-functorF:D→Eis called an internal left adjoint in ModC(PrL(B))
if there is aC-linearB-functor G:E→Dequipped withC-linear transformations ε:FG⇒id and
η: id⇒GFsatisfying the triangle identities.
We have the following characterization of internal left adjoints:
Lemma 2.21. AC-linearB-functor F:D→Eis an internal left adjoint in ModC(PrL(B))if and
only if its right adjoint G:D→EinCat(B)preserves colimits and satisﬁes the projection formula:
for every B∈B, everyC∈C(B)and every E∈E(B), the canonical map C⊗BG(E)→G(C⊗BE)
is an equivalence in D(B).
Proof.By Proposition A.5, the right adjoint GofGis a right adjoint internal to Mod C(Cat(B)) if
and only if Gsatisﬁes the projection formula. The adjunction lifts further to M odC(PrL(B)) if and
only ifGpreserves colimits.
The property for a C-linear functor Fto be an internal left adjoint can be checked locally in B:
Proposition 2.22. LetF:D→Ebe aC-linearB-functor and assume that B։1is an eﬀective
epimorphism inB. ThenFis an internal left adjoint in ModC(PrL(B))if and only if π∗
BFis an
internal left adjoint in ModC(PrL(B/B)).
Proof.LetG:E→Dbe the right adjoint of F. Since PrL
Bis a parametrized subcategory of Cat B
and thus satisﬁes descent w.r.t. eﬀective epimorphisms, Gpreserves colimits if and only if π∗
BG
does. By Lemma 2.21, it thus remains to show that Gsatisﬁes the projection formula if and only
ifπ∗
BGdoes. This is true because checking that for objects A∈B,C∈C(A) andE∈E(A) the
mapC⊗BG(E)→G(C⊗BE) is an equivalence in D(A) can be done after pulling back along the
eﬀective epimorphism A×B։A.
Free and cofree C-linearB-categories
Continue to ﬁx a presentably symmetric monoidal B-categoryC. We will next associate to every
objectA∈BtwoC-linearB-categoriesC[A] andCA, thefreeandcofreeC-linearB-categories on
A, and prove that they are in fact equivalent, see Corollary 2.29below. The arguments are entirely
analogous to those of [ CCRY22 , Section 4.1].
Deﬁnition 2.23. LetD∈ModC(PrL(B)) be aC-linearB-category. For an object A∈B, we deﬁne
theC-linearB-categoriesD[A] andDAby
D[A] := colim AD= (πA)!π∗
AD andDA:= lim AD= (πA)∗π∗
AD,
12theA-indexed colimit and limit of the constant diagram on Din theB-category Mod C(PrL
B). For a
morphism f:A→BinB, we denote by
f!:D[A]→D[B] and f∗:DB→DA
the inducedC-linearB-functors, obtained by plugging the appropriate unit or counit. Th eir right
adjoints in Cat(B) are denoted by
f∗:D[B]→D[A] and f∗:DA→DB.
Since the forgetful functors Mod C(PrL
B)→PrL
B→CatBpreservelimits by [ MW22, Proposition7.2.7]
and [MW22, Proposition 6.4.9], the underlying B-category ofDAis theB-category ( πA)∗π∗
AD=
D(A×−):Bop→Cat∞, alternatively described as the parametrized functor category F unB(A,D).
Corollary 2.24. There is a natural equivalence of C-linearB-categories
FunC(C[A],D)∼−−→DA.
Proof.The internal hom B-functor FunC(−,D): Mod C(PrL
B)op→ModC(PrL
B) turns colimits in
ModC(PrL
B) into limits and returns Dwhen evaluated at the monoidal unit C ∈ModC(PrL(B)),
hence we have
FunC(C[A],D) = FunC(colim AC,D)≃limAFunC(C,D)≃limAD=DA.
Lemma 2.25. For objects A,B∈B, there is an equivalence
C[A]⊗CD[B]≃D[A×B].
Proof.Since−⊗C−preserves colimits in both variables and C⊗CD≃D, this follows from the ob-
servation that colim AcolimB≃colimA×B: both sides are left adjoint to the diagonal Mod C(PrL
B)→
FunB(A×B,ModC(PrL
B)).
Proposition 2.26. LetDbe aC-linearB-category.
(1) For every morphism f:A→BinB, theC-linearB-functor f!:C[A]→C[B]admits aC-linear
right adjoint f∗:C[B]→C[A];
(2) For every pullback square in Bas on the left, the induced square of C-linearB-functors as on
the right is (vertically) right adjointable in ModC(PrL(B)):
A′A

(3) For every morphism f:A→BinB, theC-linearB-functor f∗:DB→DAadmits aC-linear
left adjoint f!:DA→DB;
13(4) For every pullback square in Bas on the left, the induced square of C-linearB-functors as on
the right is (vertically) left adjointable in ModC(PrL(B)):
A′A
B′Bα

(5) For every morphism f:A→BinB, there are naturally commutative squares of C-linearB-
functors

FunC(C[A],D)DA−◦f!≃
f∗
≃andFunC(C[A],D)DA
FunC(C[B],D)DB.−◦f∗≃
f!
≃
Proof.Parts (3) and (4) follow immediately from (1) and (2) because of the natural equivalence
FunC(C[A],D)≃DA. For (5), the left-hand square is simply naturality in Aof the equivalence
FunC(C[A],D)≃DA, and the right-hand square is obtained from this by passing to inter nal left
adjoints in Mod C(PrL(B)). For parts (1) and (2), consider the base change functor C⊗ΩB−: PrL
B≃
ModΩB(PrL
B)→ModC(PrL
B). It is a colimit-preserving symmetric monoidal 2-functor, and thu s we
haveC[A]≃C⊗ ΩBΩB[A]. It thus suﬃces to show the claim when C= ΩB. In this case we have
an equivalence Ω B[A]≃PShΩ(A) by [MW21, Theorem 6.1.1], and by [ MW21, Lemma 6.1.3] the
functorf!: PShΩ(A)→PShΩ(B) is given by left Kan extension. The right adjoint f∗: PShΩ(B)→
PShΩ(A) off!is therefore just the restriction functor, which is a morphism in PrL(B), proving (1).
For part (2), it suﬃces to check that for every object C∈B, evaluating the square at Cgives a
vertically right adjointable square of ∞-categories. In the case at hand, this square looks like
B/A′×CB/A×C
B/B′×CB/B×C,(α×1)◦−
(f′×1)◦− (f×1)◦−
(β×1)◦−
which is adjointable as Bsatisﬁes base change.
Corollary 2.27. For every object A∈B, theC-linear pairing
C[A]⊗CC[A]≃C[A×A]∆∗
−−→C[A]A!−→C
is part of a duality datum in ModC(PrL(B)), exhibiting theC-linearB-categoryC[A]as self-dual.
Proof.The coevaluation is given by CA∗
−−→C[A]∆!−→C[A×A]≃C[A]⊗CC[A]. The ﬁrst triangle
14identity follows from the following commutative diagram:
C[A×A×A]
C[A×A] C[A×A]
C[A] C[A] C[A],(∆×1)∗
∆∗(1×∆)!
(pr2)! pr∗
1 ∆!
where the square commutes via the Beck-Chevalley equivalence. Th e other triangle identity is
analogous.
Lemma 2.28. Letf:A→Bbe a morphism in B. Then the following diagrams commute:
C[B]C[A]
C[B]∨C[A]∨≃f∗
≃
(f!)∨andC[A]C[B]
C[A]∨C[B]∨.≃f!
≃
(f∗)∨
Proof.We will prove the left diagram. The proof for the right diagram is analo gous and is left to
the reader. Expanding the deﬁnition of ( f!)∨by plugging in the explicit evaluation and coevaluation
maps from Corollary 2.27, we see it is given by the composite
C[B](prB)∗
−−−−→C [B×A](1×(f,1))!−−−−−−→C [B×B×A](∆×1)∗
−−−−−→C [B×A](prA)!−−−−→C[A].
Observe that the maps 1 ×(f,1) and ∆×1 ﬁt into a pullback square
A B ×A
B×A B×B×A,1×(f,1)
∆×1(f,1)(f,1)
and thus it follows from base change that the above composite is hom otopic to
C[B](prB)∗
−−−−→C [B×A](f,1)∗
−−−−→C[A](f,1)!−−−→C[B×A](prA)!−−−−→C[A].
But this composite is the functor f∗:C[B]→C[A], as desired.
Under the equivalence Fun C(C[A],CA)≃CA(A) =C(A×A), the object ∆ !1Acorresponds to a
C-linearB-functorC[A]→CA.
Corollary 2.29. For every object A∈B, theB-functorC[A]→CAis an equivalence of C-linear
B-categories. Furthermore, for every map f:A→BinB, the following diagrams commute:
C[B]CB
C[A]CA≃
f∗ f∗
≃andC[A]CA
C[B]CB.≃
f!f!
≃
15Proof.By Corollary 2.27, the pairingC[A]⊗CC[A]→Cadjoints over to an equivalence C[A]∼−−→
FunC(C[A],C). Composing this with the equivalence FunC(C[A],C)≃CAfrom Corollary 2.24gives
an equivalenceC[A]∼− →CA. It remains to show that this is the B-functorC[A]→CAclassiﬁed by
∆!1A∈CA(A). Adjoining over once more, it suﬃces to show that the dual C→CA×Aof the pairing
C[A×A]→Cis classiﬁed by the object ∆ !1A∈C(A×A). But by Proposition 2.26(5) and the
construction of the pairing, this is the composite CA∗
−−→CA∆!−→CA×A. This proves the ﬁrst claim.
The two commutative diagrams follow from a combination of Lemma 2.28and Proposition 2.26(5).
Classiﬁcation of C-linear functors
As a result of Corollary 2.29, theC-linearB-categoryCAis, in a precise sense, the free C-linearB-
category on A: anyC-linearB-functorCA→Dto anotherC-linearB-categoryDis fully determined
by where it sends the object ∆ !1A∈C(A×A) =CA(A).
Corollary 2.30. For an object A∈Band aC-linearB-categoryD, the composite
FunC(CA,D)(−)A
−−−→FunC(CA×A,DA)ev∆!1A−−−−−→DA
is an equivalence of C-linearB-categories, where the last map denotes evaluation at ∆!1A∈C(A×A).
Proof.LetU∈C[A](A) denote the object classiﬁed by the identity C[A]→C[A] under the equiv-
alence Fun C(C[A],C[A])≃C[A](A). By Corollary 2.29, it suﬃces to show the statement for C[A]
instead ofCA: the composite
FunC(C[A],D)(−)A
−−−→FunC(C[A]A,DA)evU−−→DA
is an equivalence of C-linearB-categories. We claim that this composite is simply the equivalence
FunC(C[A],D)∼− →DAfrom Corollary 2.24. Indeed, as both are functorial in Dit suﬃces to show
they agree for the identity functor on D=C[A], in which case it holds by deﬁnition of the object
U.
Observation 2.31. Since the functor ( −)A: PrL(B)→PrL(B) is lax symmetric monoidal (as it
is the composite of the symmetric monoidal functor π∗
A: PrL(B)→PrL(B/A) and its right adjoint
(πA)∗), theB-categoryDAis canonically tensored over CA. We claim that the inverse of the equiva-
lence ofCorollary 2.30is adjoint to the composite DA⊗CCA−⊗A−−−−−→DAA!−→D. To see this, it suﬃces
to show that the composite DA→FunC(CA,D)∼− →DAis equivalent to the identity. Expanding
deﬁnitions, this composite is given by
DApr∗
1−−→DA×A≃DA×A⊗C1⊗∆!1A−−−−−→DA×A⊗CCA×A−⊗A×A−−−−−−−→DA×Apr2!−−→DA.
By the projection formula, this is equivalent to the composite
pr2!∆!(∆∗pr∗
1(−)⊗A1A):DA→DA,
which is equivalent to the identity since ∆: A→A×Ais a section of both projections pr1,pr2:A×
A→A.
16Specializing toD=CB, we arrive at the main result of this subsection:
Theorem 2.32. For objects A,B∈B, evaluation at ∆!1A∈CA(A)induces an equivalence of
C-linearB-categories
FunC(CA,CB)∼−−→CA×B.
The inverse is adjoint to the composite
CA×B⊗CA1⊗pr∗
A−−−−→CA×B⊗CA×B−⊗A×B−−−−−−−→CA×BprB!−−−→CB.
Deﬁnition 2.33. LetD∈ModC(PrL(B)) be aC-linearB-category and let F:CA→Dbe aC-
linearB-functor. We deﬁne DF:=FA(∆!1A)∈D(A). Conversely, for an object D∈D(A), we let
FD:CA→Ddenote theC-linearB-functor FD=A!(−⊗AD):CA→D.
Moreinformally, Corollary 2.30saysthat everyC-linearB-functorF:CA→Dis naturallyequivalent
to theB-functor A!(−⊗ADF). One should be a bit careful with the interpretation of these symb ols
“A!” and “⊗A”, as they depend on D. For example, in the case of Theorem 2.32, whereD=
CBfor some B∈B, the statement is that every C-linear functor F:CA→CBis equivalent to
prB!(pr∗
A(−)⊗A×BDF) for a unique DF∈CB(A) =C(A×B).
Corollary 2.34. LetA∈B, letDbe aC-linearB-category and let F,G:CA→Dbe twoC-linear
functors. Evaluation at ∆!1Ainduces an equivalence of spaces
NatC(F,G)∼−−→HomD(A)(DF,DG).
Proof.This follows immediately from the fact that evaluation at ∆ !1Ais an equivalence from
FunC(CA,D) toD(A) by Corollary 2.30, so that it in particular induces equivalences on mapping
spaces.
2.3 Formal inversions
IfCis a presentably symmetric monoidal ∞-category and Sis a small subcategory of C, there is
another presentably symmetric monoidal ∞-categoryC[S−1] equipped with the universal morphism
C→C[S−1] in CAlg(PrL) out ofCwhich sends all objects in Sto invertible objects, see Robalo
[Rob15, Section 2.1] and Hoyois [ Hoy17, Section 6.1]. The goal of this subsection is to discuss a
parametrized variant of this construction.
Deﬁnition 2.35 (Formal inversion) .LetCbe a presentably symmetric monoidal B-category, and
letS⊆Cbe a full subcategory. A morphism p:C→C′in CAlg(PrL(B)) is said to exhibitC′as a
formal inversion of SinCif for every other D∈CAlg(PrL(B)) the map of spaces
HomCAlg(PrL(B))(C′,D)→HomCAlg(PrL(B))(C,D)
given by precomposition with pis a monomorphism hitting those path components corresponding to
B-functors F:C→Dwhich invert the objects of S: for every A∈B, the functor FA:C(A)→D(A)
sends every object X∈S(A) to an invertible object in D(A).
17If such formal inversion p:C→C′exists, it is uniquely determined by this universal property and we
will denote it by p:C→C[S−1]. It is not clear to the author in what generality parametrized forma l
inversions can be expected to exist. In this article, we will contend o urselves with some speciﬁc
situations in which the formal inversion can be shown to exist.
A ﬁrst such situation is when the subcategory Sis generated by a (non-parametrized) full subcate-
goryS0⊆C(1), in the following sense:
Deﬁnition 2.36. LetCbe aB-categoryand let S⊆Cbe a subcategory. Given a small subcategory
S0⊆Γ(S)⊆Γ(C), we will say that Sis generated by S0if the following condition is satisﬁed: for
everyX∈S(B), there exists an eﬀective epimorphism f:A→BinBand an object Y∈S0⊆
C(1) = Γ(C) such that f∗X≃A∗Y.
Note that in this case, a morphism F:C→Din CAlg(PrL(B)) inverts the objects of Sif and only
if the underlying functor Γ( F): Γ(C)→Γ(D) inverts the objects of S0.
Deﬁnition 2.37. LetC ∈CAlg(PrL(B)) and let S⊆Cbe a symmetric monoidal subcategory
which is generated by a small subcategory S0⊆Γ(C). Let Γ(C)[S−1
0] denote the (non-parametrized)
formal inversion of S0in Γ(C). We deﬁne the commutative C-algebraC[S−1
0] in PrL(B) as the image
of Γ(C)[S−1
0] under the adjunction
−⊗Γ(C)C: CAlgΓ(C)(PrL)⇄CAlgC(PrL(B)) :ΓC
from Lemma 2.18.
Proposition 2.38. LetC ∈CAlg(PrL(B))and letS⊆Cbe a symmetric monoidal subcategory
which is generated by S0⊆Γ(C). Then the symmetric monoidal left adjoint C→C[S−1
0]is a formal
inversion of SinC.
Proof.LetF:C→Dbe morphism in CAlg(PrL(B)). By the adjunction between −⊗Γ(C)Cand ΓC,
there is a one-to-one correspondence between morphisms C[S−1
0]→Dof commutativeC-algebras
and morphisms Γ( C)[S−1
0]→Γ(D) of commutative Γ( C)-algebras. The claim thus follows from the
universal property of the formal inversion Γ( C)→Γ(C)[S−1
0], combined with the fact that the B-
functorF:C→Dinverts the objects of Sif and only if the underlying functor Γ( F): Γ(C)→Γ(D)
inverts the objects of S0.
Observation 2.39. InthesituationofDeﬁnition 2.37, itfollowsdirectlyfromfullyfaithfulnessofthe
functorC⊗Γ(C): ModΓ(C)(PrL)֒→ModC(PrL(B)) that the underlying ∞-category ofC[S−1
0] is given
by the non-parametrized formal inversion Γ( C)[S−1
0] ofS0in Γ(C). In particular, Proposition 2.38
not only shows that the formal inversion of SinCexists, but also that its underlying morphism in
CAlg(PrL) is a non-parametrized formal inversion.
More generally, evaluating the map C→C[S−1
0] at an object A∈Bgives a symmetric monoidal left
adjoint
C(A)→C[S−1
0](A)
which exhibitsC[S−1
0](A) as a non-parametrized formal inversion of S(A) inC(A). Indeed, this
follows immediately by applying the above observation to the slice cate goryB/A, where we use that
passing to slices preserves formal inversions by Proposition 2.47below.
18The upshot of Observation 2.39is that the formal inversion in the above setting can be obtained as
apointwise formal inversion, in the sense that C[S−1] is given at B∈Bas the non-parametrized
formalinversionC(B)[S(B)−1]. Thisobservationwillleadtotheconstructionofparametrizedfor mal
inversions in more general situations. We start by recalling the func toriality of the formal inversion
construction in the non-parametrized setting.
Deﬁnition 2.40. We deﬁne Cat ∞,augas the full subcategory of Ar(Cat ∞) = Fun(∆1,Cat∞)
spanned by the morphisms in Cat ∞corresponding to a fully faithful functor ιS:S ֒→C, where
Sis a small∞-category. The functor ιS:S ֒→Cis called an augmentation of the∞-categoryCand
the pair (C,ιS) is called an augmented∞-category . We will often abuse notation and write ( C,S)
for (C,ιS), identifying Swith its image in C.
Note that the forgetful functor Cat ∞,aug→Cat∞,(C,S)/m⊣psto→Cis faithful: for another augmented
∞-category(D,T), a morphism (C,S)→(D,T) in Cat ∞,augmay be identiﬁed with a functor C→D
which sends the full subcategory S⊆CintoT⊆D.
Deﬁnition 2.41. We deﬁne the∞-category CAlg(PrL)augofaugmented presentably symmetric
monoidal∞-categories as the pullback
CAlg(PrL)aug Cat∞,aug
CAlg(PrL) Cat ∞.
Its objects are pairs ( C,S) of a presentably symmetric monoidal ∞-categoryCequipped with an
augmentation ιS:S ֒→C.
We deﬁne a section ( −)inv: CAlg(PrL)→CAlg(PrL)augof the forgetful functor by equipping a
symmetric monoidal Cwith its collection of invertible objects.
Lemma 2.42. The functor (−)inv: CAlg(PrL)→CAlg(PrL)augadmits a left adjoint
L: CAlg(PrL)aug→CAlg(PrL)
given on objects by sending a pair (C,S)to the formal inversion C[S−1].
Proof.It suﬃces toshowthat foreverypair( C,S), the formalinversion C[S−1] isaleft adjointobject
to (C,S) under the functor ( −)inv: CAlg(PrL)→CAlg(PrL)aug. This follows from the universal
property ofC[S−1]: for everyD∈CAlg(PrL), precomposition with the functor C→C[S−1] induces
an inclusion of path components
HomCAlg(PrL)(C[S−1],D)֒→HomCAlg(PrL)(C,D)
whose image precisely consists of those functors C→Dwhich send all objects of Sto invertible
objects inD, i.e. the space of maps in CAlg(PrL)augfrom (C,S) toDinv.
We will now construct the pointwise formal inversion L(C,S) in caseB= PSh(T) is a presheaftopos.
19Construction 2.43. LetTbe a small∞-category, letB= PSh(T) and letCbe a presentably
symmetric monoidal B-categoryequipped with a small full subcategory S⊆C. We let (C,S):Top→
CAlg(PrL)augdenote the lift of the functor C:Top→CAlg(PrL) which equips the ∞-categoryC(B)
with the augmentation S(B) for every B∈T. Composing with the functor Lgives rise to a new
functor
L(C,S):Top→CAlg(PrL),
given on objects by B/m⊣psto→ C(B)[S(B)−1]. This uniquely extends to a limit-preserving functor
L(C,S):Bop→CAlg(PrL).
We claim that under suitable conditions, L(C,S) is a presentably symmetric monoidal B-category
modeling the parametrized formal inversion C[S−1]. To this end, we need some basic properties of
(non-parametrized) formal inversions.
Lemma 2.44. LetC∈CAlg(PrL)be a presentably symmetric monoidal ∞-category and let S⊆S′
be two small subcategories of C. Assume that for every object X′∈S′there exists objects X∈S
andY∈Csuch that X≃X′⊗Y. Then any formal inversion p:C→C[S−1]ofSinCalso exhibits
C[S−1]as a formal inversion of S′inC.
Proof.This is immediate from the observation that any symmetric monoidal le ft adjoint F:C→D
which inverts Smust also invert S′: ifX≃X′⊗Y, we getF(X)≃F(X′)⊗F(Y) and thus if F(X)
is invertible, so must be F(X′) andF(Y).
Lemma 2.45. LetF:C→Dbe a morphism in CAlg(PrL)and letS⊆Cbe a small subcategory.
Then the canonical map
D⊗CC[S−1]→D[F(S)−1]
obtained by adjunction from the C-linear functorC[S−1]→D[F(S)−1]is an equivalence.
Proof.It follows from spelling out the adjunctions and universal propertie s that both sides are D-
algebras in PrLwhich admit a (necessarily unique) symmetric monoidal D-linear map into another
D-algebraEif and only if the unit map D→Ecarries the objects of F(S) to invertible objects in
E. The claim thus follows from the Yoneda lemma.
We are now ready to prove that in certain cases the pointwise forma l inversionL(C,S) represents
the parametrized formal inversion C[S−1].
Proposition 2.46. LetB= PSh(T)be the∞-topos of presheaves on some small ∞-category T. Let
Cbe a presentably symmetric monoidal B-category equipped with a full subcategory S⊆C. Assume
that the following property is satisﬁed:
(∗)For every morphism f:A→BinT⊆Band every object X∈S(A), there exists objects
Y∈S(B)andZ∈C(A)such that f∗Y≃X⊗Z∈C(A).
Then the functor L(C,S):Bop→CAlg(PrL)is a presentably symmetric monoidal B-category and
the mapC=L(C,∅)→L(C,S)exhibitsL(C,S)as a formal inversion of SinC.
20Proof.We ﬁrst show that L(C,S) is a presentably symmetric monoidal B-category and that the
mapC →L(C,S) preserves colimits. This may be proved by pulling back Cto the slice topos
PSh(T)/B≃PSh(T/B) for every B∈T, hence we may assume that Tadmits a terminal object B.
In this case, consider the full subcategory S′⊆Cgiven at A∈Tby
S′(A) :={f∗X∈C(A)|X∈S(B)},
wheref:A→Bis the unique map to the terminal object. Note that S′⊆S, asSis a parametrized
subcategory ofC. It is immediate from the deﬁnition that S′is generated by S0:=S(B), in the
sense of Deﬁnition 2.36, and thus Proposition 2.38provides a formal inversion F:C→C[S−1
0] of
S′inC. As in the proof of Lemma 2.44, the assumption ( ∗) guarantees that Feven inverts all the
objects in S, and it follows that the map C→C[S−1
0] uniquely extends to a map
L(C,S)→C[S−1
0]
inFun(Top,CAlg(PrL)). ItfollowsfromObservation 2.39andLemma 2.44thatthismapis pointwise
an equivalence and hence that it is an equivalence of symmetric monoid alB-categories. Since C[S−1
0]
is presentably symmetric monoidal, it follows that so is L(C,S). Similarly we deduce that the map
C→L(C,S) preserves colimits.
We will now verify that C→L(C,S) is indeed a formal inversion. Assume that Dis a presentably
symmetric monoidal B-category. Because of the adjunction ( −)inv⊣L, ﬁberwise-colimit-preserving
symmetric monoidal B-functors G:L(C,S)→Dcorrespond to ﬁberwise-colimit-preserving sym-
metric monoidal B-functors G′:C→Dinverting the objects in S. It thus remains to show that
ifG′preserves allB-colimits, then so does its extension G. This may be tested after passing to
the slice topoi PSh( T)/B≃PSh(T/B) forB∈T, and since the construction of L(C,S) commutes
with passage to slice topoi we may assume that Tadmits a terminal object. In this case, there is a
symmetric monoidal equivalence L(C,S)≃C[S−1
0], and sinceC[S−1
0] is a formal inversion of SinC
it follows that G′admits a unique colimit-preserving symmetric monoidal extension to C[S−1
0]→D.
This in particular preserves ﬁberwise colimits, so must agree with G, ﬁnishing the proof.
We ﬁnish the section by proving that parametrized formal inversion s are preserved under passing to
slice topoi.
Proposition 2.47. LetF:C→C′be a morphism in CAlg(PrL(B))which exhibitsC′as a formal
inversion of a small subcategory SinC. Then for every object B∈B, the inducedB/B-functor

BSinπ∗
BC.
Proof.ConsiderD∈CAlg(PrL(B/B)). Because of the adjunction
π∗
B: PrL(B)⇄PrL(B/B) :(πB)∗
from Corollary 2.14and symmetric monoidality of π∗
B, a morphism F:π∗
BC→Din CAlg(PrL(B/B))
is the same as a morphism F′:C→(πB)∗Din CAlg(PrL(B)). Since the unit C→(πB)∗π∗
BCand
the counit π∗
B(πB)∗D→Dare symmetric monoidal, it follows that Finverts the objects of π∗
BSif
and only if F′inverts the objects of S. Since the map
HomCAlg(PrL(B/B))(π∗
BC′,D)→HomCAlg(PrL(B/B))(π∗
BC,D)
21given by precomposition with π∗
BFcorresponds under the adjunction to the map
HomCAlg(PrL(B))(C′,(πB)∗D)→HomCAlg(PrL(B))(C,(πB)∗D)
given by precomposition with F, we conclude that π∗
BFexhibits π∗
BC′as a formal inversion of π∗

3 Twisted ambidexterity
Fix an∞-toposBand a presentably symmetric monoidal B-categoryC. In Section 3.1, we will
associate to every morphism f:A→BinBarelative dualizing object Df∈C(A) together with
atwisted norm map Nmf:f!(−⊗Df)⇒f∗(−), which informally speaking exhibits f!(−⊗Df)
as the universal parametrized C-linear approximation to f∗. We will show in Section 3.2that
whenfisn-truncated for some n, the twisted norm map reduces to the (untwisted) norm map
Nmf:f!⇒f∗from Hopkins and Lurie [ HL13] whenever the latter is deﬁned, and use this to express
ambidexterity in terms of twisted ambidexterity. In Section 3.3we will explain the close relation
between twisted ambidexterity and Costenoble-Waner duality , a parametrized form of monoidal
duality due to [ CW16,MS06].
3.1 The twisted norm map
To deﬁne the twisted norm map Nm f, we will ﬁrst treat the case where the target Boffis the
terminal object of B. The case for arbitrary Bwill be obtained by passing to the slice topos B/B.
Deﬁnition 3.1. For an object A∈Bwe deﬁne the dualizing object DA∈C(A) ofAas
DA:= pr1∗∆!1A∈C(A),
where pr1:A×A→Ais the ﬁrst projection and ∆: A→A×Ais the diagonal of A. We let
cA: pr∗
1DA→∆!1Adenote the counit.
Under the equivalence Fun C(CA,C)≃C(A) of Theorem 2.32, the object DA∈C(A) corresponds to a
C-linearB-functor A!(−⊗DA):CA→C. As a special case of Corollary 2.34we immediately obtain
the following corollary:
Corollary 3.2. For an object A∈B, evaluation at ∆!1Ainduces an equivalence of spaces
NatC(A∗A!(−⊗ADA),idCA)∼−−→HomC(A×A)(pr∗
1DA,∆!1A). (1)
Proof.By naturality inDof the equivalence FunC(CA,D)∼−−→DAfrom Corollary 2.30, evaluating
A∗A!(−⊗ADA):CA→CAat ∆!1Agives pr∗
1DA. The statement then follows from Corollary 2.34,
since all three functors A∗,A!and−⊗ADAare canonicallyC-linear.
Deﬁnition 3.3. ForA∈B, we deﬁne aC-linearB-transformation
/tildewidestNmA:A∗A!(−⊗ADA) =⇒idCA
22astheC-linearB-transformationcorrespondingundertheequivalence( 1)tothecounitmappr∗
1DA=
pr∗
1pr1∗∆!1A→∆!1A. We will refer to /tildewidestNmAas theadjoint twisted norm map forA. We deﬁne
thetwisted norm map
NmA:A!(−⊗ADA) =⇒A∗(−)
as theB-transformation between B-functorsCA→Cadjoint to /tildewidestNmA.
Deﬁnition 3.4. An object A∈Bis called twistedC-ambidextrous if the twisted norm map Nm Ais
an equivalence.
A relative version of twisted ambidexterity is obtained by passing to s lices ofB:
Deﬁnition 3.5. For a morphism f:A→BinB, deﬁne the relative dualizing object Df∈C(A) off
asDf:= pr1∗(∆f)!1A∈C(A), where pr1:A×BA→Ais the ﬁrst projection and ∆ f:A→A×BA
is the diagonal of f. We deﬁne the twisted norm map
Nmf:f!(−⊗ADf) =⇒f∗(−)
as theB/B-transformation between B/B-functors ( π∗
BC)A→π∗
BCas in Deﬁnition 3.3. We will say
thatfistwistedC-ambidextrous if the transformation Nm fis an equivalence.
We may obtain an explicit formula for the transformation /tildewidestNmAas follows.
Lemma 3.6. ForA∈B, the transformation /tildewidestNmA:A∗A!(−⊗ADA)⇒idCAis equivalent to the
composite
A∗A!(−⊗ADA)l.b.c.≃pr2!pr∗
1(−⊗ADA)
≃pr2!(pr∗

1DA)
⇒pr2!(pr∗
1(−)⊗A×A∆!1A)
l.p.f.≃pr2!∆!(∆∗pr∗
1(−)⊗A1A)
≃idCA.
Herel.b.c.denotes the left base change equivalence, l.p.f.denotes the left projection formula equiva-
lence, and the non-invertible arrow in the middle is induced by the counit pr∗
1DA= pr∗
1pr1∗∆!1A→
∆!1A.
Proof.Bydeﬁnition, the adjointtwisted normmap /tildewidestNmAisdeﬁned tobe the mapwhoseimageunder
the equivalence Fun C(CA,CA)∼−−→C(A×A) from Theorem 2.32is the counit map pr∗
1DA→∆!1A.
Recall that an inverse to this equivalence is given by sending D∈C(A×A) to theC-linearB-functor
pr2!(pr∗
1(−)⊗A×AD):CA→CA. It follows that morphism /tildewidestNmAin Fun C(CA,CA) is equivalent to
the map pr2!(pr∗
1(−)⊗A×Apr∗
1DA)→pr2!(pr∗
1(−)⊗A×A∆!1)A) induced by the counit. Unwinding
deﬁnitions, the identiﬁcations of the source and target of these m aps happens through the left base
change equivalence and the left projection formula, giving the claim.
The twisted norm map Nm Aexhibits theB-functor A!(−⊗DA):CA→Cin a suitable sense as
the universalC-linear approximation of the B-functor A∗:CA→C. More precisely, the dual adjoint
norm map /tildewidestNmAexhibits A!(−⊗DA) as terminal among C-linearB-functor F:CA→Cequipped
with aC-linear transformation A∗F→id:
23Proposition 3.7 (Universal property twisted norm map) .For aC-linear functor F:CA→C, the
composite
NatC(F,A!(−⊗DA))A∗◦−−−−−→NatC(A∗F,A∗A!(−⊗DA))/tildewidestNmA◦−−−−−−→ NatC(A∗F,idCA)
is an equivalence of spaces.
Proof.Observe that the three instances of the equivalence of Corollary 2.34ﬁt in the following
commutative diagram:
NatC(F,A!(−⊗DA)) Nat C(A∗◦F,A∗◦A!(−⊗DA)) Nat C(A∗◦F,idCA)

1DF,∆!1A).ev∆!1A ≃A∗◦− /tildewidestNmA◦−
ev∆!1A ≃ ev∆!1A ≃
pr∗
1c∗
pr1◦−
The left square commutes by naturality of the equivalence Fun C(CA,D)≃D(A) inDand the right
square commutes because an equivalence of categories preserve s composition. It thus remains to
show that the bottom composite in the diagram is an equivalence. But this is clear since it is given
by the adjunction equivalence on hom-spaces for the adjunction p r∗
1⊣pr1∗.
As a consequence of the universal property of Nm A, we may express twisted ambidexterity in terms
ofinternal left adjoints in Mod C(PrL(B)), in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.20:
Proposition 3.8. The object Ais twistedC-ambidextrous if and only if the C-linearB-functor
A∗:C→CAis an internal left adjoint in ModC(PrL(B)).
Proof.Note that Ais twistedC-ambidextrous if and only if the adjoint twisted norm map
/tildewidestNmA:A∗A!(−⊗ADA) =⇒idCA
exhibitsA!(−⊗ADA) as aC-linear right adjoint of A∗, so that one implication is clear. Conversely,
ifA∗is an internal left adjoint with C-linear right adjoint A∗, theC-linear counit A∗A∗→id equips
A∗with the same universal property of A!(−⊗DA) of Proposition 3.7: for everyC-linearB-functor
F:CA→C, the composite
NatC(F,A∗)A∗◦−−−−−→NatC(A∗F,A∗A∗)/tildewidestNmA◦−−−−−−→ NatC(A∗F,idCA)
is an equivalence of spaces. It follows that A!(−⊗ADA) andA∗are equivalent asC-linearB-functors
CA→C, necessarily via the twisted norm map.
Remark 3.9. Applying Proposition 3.8to the slicetopos B/B, it followsthat amorphism f:A→B
inBis twistedC-ambidextrous if and only if the C-linearB/B-functor f∗:π∗
BC→(π∗
BC)Ais an
internalleft adjointin Mod C(PrL(B/B)), i.e. the rightadjoint f∗preservesB/B-parametrizedcolimits
and satisﬁes the projection formula. Applying the criterion Lemma 2.21to the slice topos B/B, this
can be made explicit in terms of non-parametrized criteria: fis twistedC-ambidextrous if and only
if for every pullback diagram

Conditions (1) and (2) correspond to the assumption that the B/B-functor f∗preservesB/B-
parametrized colimits, while condition (3) is equivalent to the condition f∗isC-linear.
Example 3.10. WhenB= Spc is the∞-topos Spc of spaces and C= Sp is the∞-category of
spectra, the universal property of the twisted norm map appear s as [NS18, Theorem I.4.1(v)]. Since
every colimit-preserving functor between stable presentable ∞-categories is Sp-linear, the universal
property simpliﬁes to the statement that the twisted norm map colim A(−⊗DA)⇒limA(−) exhibits
its source as the universal colimit-preserving approximation of its t arget. The object DA∈SpAis
called the dualizing spectrum ofA, and was studied by Klein [ Kle01]. As a functor A→Sp, it may
be identiﬁed with the composite
Aa/maps⊔o→MapA(a,−)−−−−−−−−−→ SpcAΣ∞
+−−→SpAlimA−−−→Sp.
Example 3.11. LetGbe a compact Lie group and let B= SpcGbe the∞-topos of G-spaces. For
C= SpGtheB-categoryof genuine G-spectra, to be introduced in Deﬁnition 4.2below, the universal
propertyofthetwisted normmapwasestablishedbyQuigleyandSha h[QS21, Theorem5.47]. Again
the statement simpliﬁes due to SpG-linearity being automatic.
Example 3.12. LetB= Spc be the∞-topos of spaces and let Cbe a presentably symmetric
monoidal∞-category. By Proposition 3.8, a space Ais twistedC-ambidextrous if and only if it
isC-adjointable in the terminology of [ CCRY22 , Deﬁnition 4.17]. In particular, the following are
examples of twisted C-ambidextrous spaces:
(1) IfCis stable, then every compact space is twisted C-ambidextrous, [ CCRY22 , Example 4.24].
(2) IfCism-semiadditive for some m≥−2, then every m-ﬁnite space is twisted C-ambidextrous,
[CCRY22 , Example 4.22].
(3) ItCis ann-category (i.e., its mapping spaces are ( n−1)-truncated), then every n-connected
space is twistedC-ambidextrous, [ CCRY22 , Example 4.23].
(4) LetC= PrL
κbe the∞-category of κ-presentable∞-categories for a regular cardinal κ. Then
everyspace is twistedC-ambidextrous, [ CCRY22 , Example 4.26].
25The twistedC-ambidextrous morphisms form a well-behaved class of morphisms in B:
Proposition 3.13. The collection of twisted C-ambidextrous morphisms is
(1) closed under composition;
(2) closed under arbitrary disjoint unions;
(3) closed under base change;
(4) closed under cartesian products;
(5) a local class of morphisms in B, in the sense of [ Lur09, Deﬁnition 6.1.3.8]. Equivalently, it is
closed under disjoint unions, and for every pullback square
A′A
B′Bf′α
f
β(2)
inBsuch that f′is twistedC-ambidextrous and β:B′։Bis an eﬀective epimorphism, also f
is twistedC-ambidextrous.
Proof.(1) For closure under composition, let f:A→Bandg:B→Cbe twistedC-ambidextrous
morphisms. We may write the B/C-functor ( gf)∗: [C,C]C→[A,C]Cas a composite of g∗: [C,C]C→
[B,C]Candf∗: [B,C]C→[A,C]C. These are both left adjoints internal to Mod C(PrL(B/C)) by
Remark3.9, and thus so is ( gf)∗. Another application of Remark 3.9then shows that gfis twisted
C-ambidextrous as well.
(2) Closure under disjoint unions follows directly from Remark 3.9, using the equivalence C(/unionsqtext
iAi)≃/producttext
iC(Ai). (3) Closure under base change is immediate from Remark 3.9. (4) Closure under cartesian
products follows from closure under base change and closure unde r composition.
(5) We check that the twisted C-ambidextrous morphisms form a local class in B. We showed
closure under disjoint unions in part (2). Consider a pullback square (2), where f′is twistedC-
ambidextrous and β:B′։Bis an eﬀective epimorphism. We have to show that also fis twistedC-
ambidextrous,i.e. the B/B-functorf∗:π∗

BC)AisaninternalleftadjointinMod C(PrL(B/B)).
By Proposition 2.22, it suﬃces to check this after pulling f∗back along βto the sliceB/B′. But
there it becomes the condition that the B/B′-functorf′∗:π∗
B′C→(π∗
B′C)A′is an internal left adjoint
in Mod C(PrL(B/B′)), which holds by assumption on f′.
Corollary 3.14. ForB= Spc, the∞-topos of spaces, a map f:A→Bis twistedC-ambidextrous
if and only if each of its ﬁbers are twisted C-ambidextrous.
Proof.This is immediate from parts (2) and (5) of Proposition 3.13, since there exists an eﬀective

263.2 Relation to ambidexterity and parametrized semiadditi vity
In[HL13, Construction4.1.8,Remark4.1.12],HopkinsandLurieintroducefor every‘Beck-Chevalley
ﬁbration’ q:C→Ba collection ofC-ambidextrous morphisms f:A→BinB, each of which come
equipped with a norm equivalence Nm f:f!∼−−→f∗. In this subsection, we will compare this notion
of ambidexterity with our notion of twisted ambidexterity. As a cons equence, we relate twisted
ambidexterity with the notion of parametrized semiadditivity introdu ced by Nardin [ Nar16] and
Lenz, Linskens and the author [ CLL23].
Deﬁnition 3.15 (Iterated diagonals) .Letf:A→Bbe a morphism in B. Thediagonal ∆(f) off
is the map (1 ,1):A→A×BA. Theiterated diagonals ∆k(f) offare deﬁned inductively by letting
∆0(f) :=fand ∆k+1(f) := ∆(∆k(f)).
The functorC:Bop→Cat∞can be unstraightened to a cartesian ﬁbration /tildewideC→B. SinceChas
parametrized colimits, this is a Beck-Chevalley ﬁbration, in the sense of [HL13, Deﬁnition 4.1.3].
Proposition 3.16. Letf:A→Bbe a morphism in Band assume that fisn-truncated for some
natural number n.
(1) The morphism fisC-ambidextrous (in the sense of [ HL13, Construction 4.1.8] applied to the
Beck-Chevalley ﬁbration /tildewideC→B) if and only if each of the iterated diagonals ∆k(f)fork=
0,1,...,n+1is twistedC-ambidextrous (in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.5).
(2) Similarly, fis weaklyC-ambidextrous (in the sense of [ HL13, Construction 4.1.8] applied to
the Beck-Chevalley ﬁbration /tildewideC →B) if and only if each of the iterated diagonals ∆k(f)for
k= 1,...,n+1is twistedC-ambidextrous.
(3) Iffis weaklyC-ambidextrous, then there is an equivalence Df≃1Abetween the dualizing object
Dfand the monoidal unit 1A∈C(A), and the composite
f!(−)≃f!(−⊗ADf)Nmf−−−→f∗(−)
is equivalent to the norm map f!→f∗of [HL13, Remark 4.1.12].
Proof.We prove the three claims by simultaneous induction on n. Forn=−2,fis an equivalence
and parts (1) and (2) are vacuous as every equivalence is both C-ambidextrous as well as twisted
C-ambidextrous. In this case, f!andf∗are both inverse to f∗and therefore admit a canonical
equivalence Nm f:f!≃f∗of parametrized functors CA→C, which agrees with the norm map of
Hopkins and Lurie. Evaluating this equivalence at ∆ !1A∈C(A×A) =CA(A) gives an equivalence
1A≃DfinC(A), and the last statement of (3) then holds by construction.
Now assume that n≥−1. The diagonal ∆( f) offis (n−1)-truncated, so by part (1) of the
induction hypothesis it is C-ambidextrous (that is, fis weaklyC-ambidextrous) if and only if all the
iterated diagonals ∆k(f) fork= 1,...,n+1 are twistedC-ambidextrous, proving part (2). In this
case, there is an equivalence
Df= pr1∗∆!1ANm∆−−−→
≃pr1∗∆∗1A=1A∈ C(A).
27Plugging in (the inverse of) this equivalence in the twisted norm map Nm fand using the description
of Nm fgiven in Lemma 3.6(applied to the slice topos B/B), one sees that the composite in (3) is
adjoint to the following composite:
f∗f!(−)≃pr2!pr∗
1(−)u∗
∆−−→pr2!∆∗∆∗pr∗
1(−)Nm∆←−−−
≃pr2!∆!∆∗pr∗
1(−)≃id◦id = id.
But this composite is precisely (a parametrized version of) the map ν(n+1)
f:f∗f!→id of [HL13,
Construction 4.1.8], and its adjoint f!→f∗is the norm map of [ HL13, Remark 4.1.12], ﬁnishing the
proof of (3).
Finally we deduce part (1) from (2) and (3). Given (2), we may assum e thatfis weaklyC-
ambidextrous, and we need to show it is twisted C-ambidextrous if and only if it is C-ambidextrous.
In other words, we need to show that the twisted norm map is an equ ivalence if and only if the norm
mapf!→f∗of Hopkins and Lurie is an equivalence. This is immediate from part (3).
Specializing the result of Proposition 3.16to the case where Bis the∞-topos of spaces, we obtain
the following corollary:
Corollary 3.17. LetCbe a presentably symmetric monoidal ∞-category and let Abe a connected
n-truncated space. Then the following conditions are equiva lent:
(1) The space AisC-ambidextrous in the sense of [ HL13, Deﬁnition 4.3.4];
(2) Each of the objects A,ΩA,...,Ωn+1Ais twistedC-ambidextrous in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.4.
Proof.Lettingf:A→pt denote the map from Ato the point, we observe that each of the ﬁbers
of the iterated diagonal ∆kfis given by the k-fold loop space ΩkA. It follows from Corollary 3.14
that ΩkAis twistedC-ambidextrous if and only if the iterated diagonal ∆kAofAis twistedC-
ambidextrous. The claim thus follows from Proposition 3.16.
As a consequence, we obtain a characterizationof higher semiaddit ivity in terms of twisted ambidex-
terity. An advantage of this characterization over the usual deﬁ nition of ambidexterity is that all
the twisted norm maps are a priori deﬁned rather than through an inductive process.
Corollary 3.18. LetCbe a presentably symmetric monoidal ∞-category and let −2≤m≤∞.
ThenCism-semiadditive if and only if each m-ﬁnite space is twisted C-ambidextrous.
Proof.This is immediate from Corollary 3.17, as the iterated loop spaces of an m-ﬁnite space are
againm-ﬁnite.
Corollary 3.19. LetCbe a presentably symmetric monoidal B-category, let A∈Band let−2≤
m≤∞. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
(1) the∞-categoryC(A)ism-semiadditive;
(2) the fold map colimXA→Ais twistedC-ambidextrous for every m-ﬁnite space X.
28Proof.For an object A∈B, consider the (unique) colimit-preserving functor LA: Spc→Bsending
the point to A, given on objects by X/m⊣psto→colimXA. The∞-categoryC(A) is encoded as a Spc-
category by the composite
SpcopLA−−→BopC− →PrL.
SinceLApreserves pullbacks, a morphism f:X→Yof spaces is twisted C(A)-ambidextrous if and
only if the map LA(f):LA(X)→LA(Y) is twistedC-ambidextrous. Applying this to Y= pt shows
thatX→∗is twistedC(A)-ambidextrous if and only if the map colim XA=LA(X)→Ais twisted
C-ambidextrous. The claim now follows from Corollary 3.18.
In [Nar16] and [CLL23], parametrized notions of semiadditivity were introduced. By Propo si-
tion3.16, these may be expressed in terms of twisted ambidexterity:
Corollary 3.20. LetTbe a small∞-category and let P⊆Tbe an atomic orbital subcategory, in the
sense of [ CLL23, Deﬁnition 4.3.1]. Let Cbe a presentably symmetric monoidal PSh(T)-category.
ThenCisP-semiadditive in the sense of [ CLL23, Deﬁnition 4.5.1] if and only if Cis ﬁberwise
semiadditive and every morphism p:A→BinPis twistedC-ambidextrous.
Proof.By [CLL23, Corollary4.5.7], CisP-semiadditive if and only if it is ﬁberwise semiadditive and
the norm map Nm p:p!→p∗from [CLL23, Construction 4.3.8] is an equivalence for every morphism
p:A→BinP. By [CLL23, Remark 4.3.9], this norm map agrees with the norm map Nm pdeﬁned
by Hopkins and Lurie, which in turn agrees with the twisted norm map N mpby Proposition 3.16.
This ﬁnishes the proof.
Corollary 3.21. LetTbe an atomic orbital ∞-category, in the sense of [ Nar16, Deﬁnition 4.1].
LetCbe a presentably symmetric monoidal PSh(T)-category. ThenCisT-semiadditive in the sense
of [Nar16, Deﬁnition 5.3] if and only if Cis ﬁberwise semiadditive and every morphism f:A→B
inTis twistedC-ambidextrous.
Proof.This follows immediately from the previous corollary for P=T, since by [ CLL23, Proposi-
tion4.6.4]thenormmapfrom[ CLL23, Construction4.3.8]isequivalenttothenormmapconstructed
in [Nar16, Construction 5.2].
3.3 Costenoble-Waner duality
There is a close link between twisted ambidexterity and Costenoble-W aner duality, a form of duality
theory in parametrized homotopy theory introduced in the early 20 00’s by Costenoble and Waner
[CW16] and subsequently developed in more detail by May and Sigurdsson [ MS06]. The goal of this
subsection is to introduce a general form of Costenoble-Waner du ality in an arbitrary presentably
symmetric monoidal B-categoryCand explain its relationship with twisted ambidexterity.
Recall that an object Xof a symmetric monoidal ∞-categoryDis called dualizable if there exists
another object Y∈D, called the dualofX, together with an evaluation map ε:X⊗Y→1and a
coevaluation map η:1→Y⊗Xsatisfying the triangle identities:
X⊗Y⊗X
X⊗1X 1⊗Xε⊗X X⊗ηandY⊗X⊗Y
1⊗Y Y Y ⊗1.Y⊗ε η⊗Y
29It is not diﬃcult to see that this is equivalent to the D-linear functor X⊗−:D→Dadmitting a
D-linear right adjoint, necessarily of the form Y⊗−:D→D, withD-linear unit and counit.
In our approach to Costenoble-Waner duality, we will generalize the above perspective to the
parametrized setting. In place of the correspondence between o bjectsX∈DandD-linear functors
D→Din the non-parametrized setting, we will use the equivalence Fun C(CA,CB)≃C(A×B) from
Theorem 2.32in the parametrized setting, where Cis a presentably symmetric monoidal B-category.
In particular, any object X∈C(A×B) determines aC-linearB-functor FX:CA→CBgiven by the
composite
FX:CApr∗
A−−→CA×B−⊗A×BX−−−−−−→CA×BprB!−−−→CB,
and everyC-linearB-functor F:CA→CBis of this form for a unique object DF∈C(A×B).
Convention 3.22. Whenever we write X∈C(A×B), we think of Xas being directed from A
towardsB. If we wish to think of Xas being directed from BtowardsA, we will write X∈C(B×A)
instead. This also applies when B= 1 is the terminal object of B, meaning that we distinguish
between X∈C(A) =C(A×1) andX∈C(A) =C(1×A).
Deﬁnition 3.23 (cf. [MS06, Construction 17.1.3, Proposition 17.1.4]) .For an object A∈B, we
deﬁneUA:= ∆!1A∈C(A×A). Forobjects A,B,C∈Bandobjects X∈C(A×B)andY∈C(B×C),
theircomposition product Y⊙X∈C(A×C) is deﬁned as
Y⊙X:= (prAC)!(pr∗
ABX⊗pr∗
BCY),
where prAB:A×B×C→A×Bdenotes the projection and similarly for prBCand prAC. This
gives rise to a functor −⊙−:C(B×C)×C(A×B)→C(A×C).
The followinglemma may be regardedasa justiﬁcation for the deﬁnitio n ofthe compositionproduct:
Lemma 3.24. In the above situation, there are natural equivalences
FUA≃idCA∈FunC(CA,CA),
FY⊙X≃FY◦FX∈FunC(CA,CC).
Proof.The ﬁrst equivalence is immediate, as the equivalence Fun C(CA,CA)≃C(A×A) of Theo-
rem2.32is given by evaluation at ∆ !1A. For the second equivalence, plugging in the deﬁnition of
Y⊙Xand using the projection formula for prAC!shows that FY⊙Xis given by the composite
CApr∗
A−−→CA×Cpr∗
AC−−−→CA×B×C−⊗pr∗
ABX⊗pr∗
BCY−−−−−−−−−−−−−→CA×C×BprAC!−−−−→CA×CprC!−−−→CC.
Using symmetric monoidality of the functors pr∗
ABand pr∗
BCand using the base change equivalence
pr∗
BprB!≃prBC!pr∗
AB, this is equivalent to the composite
CApr∗
A−−→CA×B−⊗X−−−→CA×BprB!−−−→CBpr∗
B−−→CB×C−⊗Y−−−→CB×CprC!−−−→CC.
But this is simply FY◦FX, ﬁnishing the proof.
30We will frequently use Lemma 3.24to deduce properties of the composition product which can be
somewhat tedious to prove by hand. For example, it follows directly f rom Lemma 3.24that the
composition product is associative and unital up to homotopy. The o bjectsUA= ∆!1A∈C(A×A)
serve as identities with respect to the composition product: for an objectX∈C(A×B) there are
equivalences
X⊙UA≃X and UB⊙X≃X.
For brevity, we will mostly suppress the associativity and unitality eq uivalences from the notation
and treat them as identities, just like we do for functors.
We may now introduce a parametrized analogue of monoidal duality, ﬁ rst discovered by Costenoble
and Waner [ CW16] in the context of equivariant homotopy theory.
Deﬁnition 3.25 (cf. [MS06, Deﬁnition 16.4.1, Chapter 18]) .An object X∈C(A×B) is called left
Costenoble-Waner dualizable if there is another object Y∈C(B×A), called the left Costenoble-
Waner dual of X, together with morphisms
ε:X⊙Y→UBand η:UA→Y⊙X
inC(B×B) resp.C(A×A) satisfying the triangle identities
X⊙Y⊙X
X⊙UAX U B⊙Xε⊙X X⊙ηandY⊙X⊙Y
UA⊙Y Y Y ⊙UB.Y⊙ε η⊙Y
Conversely, we call Xtheright Costenoble-Waner dual ofY. Sometimes we say left dual andright
dualfor brevity. Note that X∈C(A×B) is left Costenoble-Waner dualizable if and only if it is
right Costenoble-Waner dualizable when treated as an object X∈C(B×A).
Warning 3.26. In [MS06], the phrase ‘Costenoble-Waner duality’ is only used when Ais the
terminal object of B. When Bis the terminal object, they use the phrase ‘ﬁberwise duality’,
compare also Lemma 3.34below.
Due to the translation from Lemma 3.24between the composition product and composition of
C-linearB-functors, we can express Costenoble-Waner duality in terms of in ternal adjunctions in
ModC(PrL(B)), in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.20.
Lemma 3.27. An object X∈C(A×B)is left Costenoble-Waner dualizable if and only if the C-
linearB-functor FX:CA→CBassociated to Xis an internal left adjoint in ModC(PrL(B)). In this
case, theC-linear right adjoint of FXis given by FY:CB→CA, whereY∈C(B×A)is a left6
Costenoble-Waner dual of X.
Proof.IfXis left Costenoble-Waner dualizable with right dual Y, we may use Lemma 3.24to turn
the evaluation and coevaluation εandνintoC-linear counit and unit maps FX◦FY→idCBand
idCA→FY◦FX, respectively. The triangle identities for the Costenoble-Waner du ality between X
andYtranslate into the triangle identities of an internal adjunction FX⊣FYin Mod C(PrL(B)).
Conversely, if FXis an internal left adjoint internal to Mod C(PrL(B)) withC-linear right adjoint
G:CB→CA, then it follows from Theorem 2.32thatGis of the form FYfor some object Y∈
6The fact that leftduals correspond to rightadjoints is unfortunate but seems to be the standard convent ion.
31C(B×A), and by Lemma 3.24the unit and counit of the adjunction give rise to the coevaluation
and evaluation satisfying the triangle identities, and thus providing d uality data between Xand
Y.
Remark 3.28. May and Sigurdsson [ MS06, Section 16.4] deﬁne Costenoble-Waner duality as a
special case of a notion they call duality in a closed symmetric bicategory , applied to a certain
bicategoryExof parametrized equivariant spectra [ MS06, Construction 17.1.3]. From our perspec-
tive, one might think of their bicategory Exas the full subcategory of the homotopy 2-category of
ModC(PrL(B)) spanned by objects of the form CAforA∈B. Indeed, due to Theorem 2.32and
Lemma3.24, we obtain the following more explicit description of this bicategory:
•The objectsCAcorrespond to objects AofB;
•GivenA,B∈B, the category of morphisms CA→CBcan be identiﬁed with the homotopy
category Ho(C(A×B));
•The identity morphisms are given by UA∈C(A×A);
•The composition is given by the composition product −⊙−:C(B×C)×C(A×B)→C(A×C).
When applied to the ∞-topos SpcGofG-spaces for a compact Lie group Gand to the G-category
SpGof genuine G-spectra, to be deﬁned in Section 4.1below, this is essentially the bicategory Ex
of May and Sigurdsson.
We get the following reformulation of twisted ambidexterity in terms o f Costenoble-Waner duality:
Proposition 3.29. An object A∈Bis twistedC-ambidextrous if and only if the monoidal unit
1A∈C(A) =C(1×A)is left Costenoble-Waner dualizable. In this case, the left dual of 1Ais given
by the dualizing object DA∈C(A) =C(A×1).
Proof.TheC-linearB-functor F1A:C → CAassociated to 1AisA∗:C → CA. It follows from
Lemma3.27that1Ais Costenoble-Waner dualizable if and only if A∗:C→CAis an internal left
adjoint in Mod C(PrL(B)), which by Proposition 3.8is true ifand only if Ais twistedC-ambidextrous.
In this case, the right adjoint of A∗is classiﬁed by the object DA∈C(A) =C(A×1).
Characterizations of Costenoble-Waner duality
Forlateruse, werecallvariousalternativecharacterizationsofC ostenoble-Wanerdualityfrom[ MS06]
and [CW16].
Lemma 3.30 (cf. [MS06, Proposition 16.4.6]) .Consider objects X∈C(A×B)andY∈C(B×A)
and letε:X⊙Y→UBbe a morphism in C(B×B). Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) The object Yis a left Costenoble-Waner dual of Xwith evaluation map ε.
(2) For every C∈Band objects W∈C(A×C)andZ∈C(B×C), the map
HomC(A×C)(W,Z⊙X)−⊙Y−−−→HomC(B×C)(W⊙Y,Z⊙X⊙Y)ε− →HomC(B×C)(W⊙Y,Z)
is an equivalence;
32(3) Condition (2) holds for C=A,W=UA,Z=Yand forC=B,W=X,Z=UB.
Proof.Given (1), an inverse to the map in (2) is given by
HomC(B×C)(W⊙Y,Z)−⊙X−−−→HomC(A×C)(W⊙Y⊙X,Z⊙X)η− →HomC(A×C)(W,Z⊙X).
It is clear that (2) implies (3). Given (3), we may take C=A,W=UA,Z=Yand deﬁne the
coevaluation η:UA→Y⊙Xto be the inverse image of the identity on Yunder the equivalence
from (2). One of the triangle identities holds by construction. For t he other one, we take C=B,
W=XandZ=UB, and observe that both id X:X→Xas well as ( X⊙ε)◦(η⊙X):X→Xare
sent to the map ε:X⊙Y→UBby the equivalence from (2), implying that they are homotopic.
Deﬁnition 3.31. If the equivalent conditions of Lemma 3.30hold, we say that εexhibitsYas a
left Costenoble-Waner dual of X.
Any object X∈C(A×B) admits a weakdual. For simplicity, we will only introduce this when A
is the terminal object of B.
Deﬁnition 3.32 (cf. [CW16, Deﬁnition 2.9.1]) .LetB∈Band consider an object X∈C(B) =
C(1×B). We deﬁne the weak Costenoble-Waner dual ofXto be
DCW
B(X) := pr2∗HomB×B(pr∗
1X,∆!1B)∈ C(B),
where ∆: B→B×Bis the diagonal of B, and pr1,pr2:B×B→Bare the two projections.
Note that for any object Y∈ C(B) =C(B×1), there is a one-to-one correspondence between
morphisms Y→DCW
B(X) inC(B) and morphisms X⊙Y= pr∗
1X⊗B×Bpr∗
2Y→∆!1B=UBin
C(B×B). In particular, the identity on DCW
B(X) gives rise to a map ε0:X⊙DCW
B(X)→UB.
Lemma 3.33 (cf. [CW16, Theorem2.9.5]) .An object X∈C(B) =C(1×B)is left Costenoble-Waner
dualizable if and only if the map ε0:X⊙DCW
B(X)→UBexhibitsDCW
B(X)as a left Costenoble-
Waner dual of X.
Proof.The “if” direction is obvious. For the “only if”, assume that Xis left Costenoble-Waner
dualizable with left dual Y∈C(B×1) and let ε:X⊙Y→UBandη:UA→Y⊙Xbe evaluation
and coevaluation maps exhibiting this duality. The map εadjoints over to a map Y→DCW
B(X)
and it will suﬃce to show that this is an equivalence. Indeed, a reason ably straightforward diagram
chase shows that an inverse is given by the composite
DCW
B(X) =UA⊙DCW
B(X)η⊙1−−→Y⊙X⊙DCW
B(X)1⊙ε0−−−→Y⊙UB=Y.
Lemma 3.34 (cf. [MS06, Proposition 18.1.1]) .An object X∈C(A) =C(A×1)is left Costenoble-
Waner dualizable if and only if it is dualizable in the symmet ric monoidal∞-categoryC(A). Its left
Costenoble-Waner dual in C(A) =C(1×A)is given by the monoidal dual in C(A).
Proof.Consider objects X∈C(A) =C(A×1) andY∈C(A) =C(1×A). Unwinding deﬁnitions,
we see that X⊙Y≃A!(X⊗AY)∈C(1). It follows that a morphism ε:X⊙Yε− →U1=1inC(1)
is the same data as a morphism ε′:X⊗AY→A∗1=1AinC(A). We claim that εexhibits Yas
a left Costenoble-Waner dual to Xif and only if ε′exhibits Yas a dual of XinC(A). Using some
diagram chasing, this follows from Lemma 3.30. As the proof is entirely analogous to the proof of
[MS06, Proposition 18.1.1], we will omit it.
33Preservation properties of Costenoble-Waner duality
Costenoble-Waner dualizable objects are preserved under a varie ty of constructions.
Lemma 3.35. LetF:C→Dbe a symmetric monoidal left adjoint between presentably sy mmetric
monoidalB-categories. Then Fpreserves left/right Costenoble-Waner dualizable object s.
Proof.It suﬃces to observe that Fcommutes with the composition products on CandD, which is
immediate from the deﬁnition.
Corollary 3.36. LetF:C→Dbe a symmetric monoidal left adjoint between presentably sy mmetric
monoidalB-categories. Then any twisted C-ambidextrous object in Bis also twistedD-ambidextrous.
Consequently, any twisted C-ambidextrous morphism in Bis also twistedD-ambidextrous.
Proof.SinceFpreserves monoidal units, the ﬁrst statement is a consequence o f Lemma 3.35and
Proposition 3.29. The second statement follows by passing to slice topoi B/B.
Lemma 3.37. IfX∈C(A×B)andX′∈C(B×C)are left Costenoble-Waner dualizable with left
dualsYandY′, then so is their composition product X′⊙X∈C(A×C), with left dual Y⊙Y′.
Proof.This is immediate from Lemma 3.27, since internal adjunctions compose.
Lemma 3.38. LetX∈C(A×B)be left Costenoble-Waner dualizable with left dual Y∈C(B×A)
(1) For a map f:A′→A, the object (f×1)∗X∈C(A′×B)is left Costenoble-Waner dualizable,
with left dual given by (1×f)∗Y.
(2) For a map g:B→B′, the object (1×g)!X∈C(A×B′)is left Costenoble-Waner dualizable,
with left dual given by (g×1)!Y.
(3) For a twisted C-ambidextrous map f:A→A′, the object (f×1)!X∈C(A′×B)is left Costenoble-
Waner dualizable, with left dual given by (1×f)!Y.
(4) For a twisted C-ambidextrous map g:B′→B, the object (1×g)∗X∈C(A×B′)is left Costenoble-
Waner dualizable, with left dual given by (g×1)∗Y.
Proof.In each case, the claim follows from Proposition 2.26(5) and the fact that adjunctions com-
pose, using that for a morphism f:A→B, theB-functor f!:CA→CBis always an internal left
adjoint, while f∗:CB→CAis an internal left adjoint whenever fis twistedC-ambidextrous.
Corollary 3.39. Assume that X∈C(1×A)is left Costenoble-Waner dualizable with left dual
Y∈C(A×1). ThenA!X∈C(1)is a dualizable object with dual A!Y.
Corollary 3.40. AssumeA∈Bis twistedC-ambidextrous. Then the object A!1A∈C(1)is dualiz-
able, with dual A!DA.
Proof.Combine the previous corollary with Proposition 3.29.
Proposition 3.41 (cf. [MS06, Proposition 16.8.1]) .For every object every B∈B, the collection of
left Costenoble-Waner dualizable objects in C(1×B)is closed under retracts. If Cis ﬁberwise stable,
then these objects form a stable (and hence thick) subcatego ry ofC(1×B).
34Proof.By Lemma 3.33and Lemma 3.30, an object X∈C(1×B) is left Costenoble-Wanerdualizable
if and only if for all C∈B,W∈C(1×C) andZ∈C(B×C), a certain map
HomC(1×C)(W,Z⊙X)→HomC(B×C)(W⊙DCW
B(X),Z)
is an equivalence. Since this map is natural in X, it follows that the collection of objects for which
it is an equivalence is closed under retracts.
IfCis ﬁberwise stable, we can lift the above map to a map at the level of ma pping spectra. In
that case both sides are exact in X, and it follows that the collection of objects for which it is an
equivalence forms a stable subcategory.
Corollary 3.42. The collection of twisted C-ambidextrous objects of Bis closed under retracts. If
Cis ﬁberwise stable, then the collection of twisted C-ambidextrous objects of Bis also closed under
ﬁnite colimits.
Proof.Consider a retract diagram As− →Br− →AinB, i.e. we have rs= idA. Assume that Bis
twistedC-ambidextrous. It follows from Proposition 3.29that1B∈C(B) is left Costenoble-Waner
dualizable, so by Lemma 3.38alsor!1Bis left Costenoble-Waner dualizable. Since 1A∈C(A) is a
retract of r!1B, it is left Costenoble-Waner dualizable by Proposition 3.41, and thus Ais twisted
C-ambidextrous by Proposition 3.29.
Now assume that Cis ﬁberwise stable. Since C(∅) =∗, it follows from pointedness of Cthat the
initial object∅is twistedC-ambidextrous. Consider a pushout diagram in B
A B
C D,fg
h
k
and assume that A,BandCare twistedC-ambidextrous. We need to show that Dis twisted
C-ambidextrous. By descent, the functors h∗andk∗induce an equivalence ( h∗,k∗):C(D)∼− →
C(B)×C(A)C(C). It follows that the monoidal unit 1D∈C(D) sits in a coﬁber sequence
(hg)!1A→h!1B⊕k!1C→1D:
the fact that ( hg)!1Ais a pushout of h!1Bandk!1Calong 1Dtranslates under the adjunction
equivalences to the description of hom-spaces in C(D) as a pullback of the hom-spaces in C(B) and
C(C) overC(A). By Proposition 3.29, the objects 1A,1Band1Care left Costenoble-Waner dualiz-
able, and thus by Lemma 3.38so are (hg)!1A,h!1Bandk!1C. It thus follows from Proposition 3.41
that1Dis left Costenoble-Wanerdualizable, hence Dis twistedC-ambidextrousby Proposition 3.29.
This ﬁnishes the proof.
4 Equivariant homotopy theory
The goal of this section is to investigate the notion of twisted ambide xterity in stable equivariant
homotopy theory. Throughout the section, we will use the termino logy ‘G-category’ to refer to
aB-category whenBis the∞-topos SpcGofG-spaces. Since SpcGis equivalent to the presheaf
35category of the orbit ∞-category Orb GofG, aG-category may equivalently be encoded as a functor
C: Orbop
G→Cat∞. We let PrL
G:= PrL(SpcG) denote the (very large) ∞-category of presentable
G-categories.
In Section 4.1, we introduce the G-category SpGof genuine G-spectra, informally given by sending
an orbit G/Hto the∞-category SpHof genuine H-spectra. In Section 4.2we prove that SpGis the
initial stable presentablysymmetric monoidal G-categoryfor which all compact G-spaces aretwisted
ambidextrous. In Section 4.3and Section 4.4, we extend this result to the contexts of orbispectra
andproper equivariant homotopy theory , respectively. In particular, we will obtain for every (not
necessarily compact) Lie group Gand cocompact subgroup Ha Wirthm¨ uller isomorphism
indG
H(−⊗DG/H)≃coindG
H(−)
in the∞-category of proper genuine G-spectra.
4.1 Parametrized genuine G-spectra
LetGbe a compact Lie group, ﬁxed throughout this subsection. The goa l of this subsection is to
introduce the G-category SpGof genuine G-spectra and discuss its universal property in terms of
inverting representation spheres.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let{SV}be a set of representation spheres, where Vruns over a set of represen-
tatives for the isomorphism classes of ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible G-representations.7We deﬁne
the presentably symmetric monoidal ∞-category SpGofgenuineG-spectraas the formal inversion
SpG:= (SpcG
∗)[{SV}−1]
of the representation spheres SVin the∞-category SpcG
∗of pointed G-spaces, see [ Rob15, Deﬁni-
tion 2.6] or Section 2.3.
By Gepner and Meier [ GM20, Corollary C.7], the ∞-category SpGis equivalent to the ∞-category
underlying the model category of orthogonal G-spectra with the stable model structure constructed
in [MM02, Section III.4]. References on equivariant orthogonal spectra in clude [HHR16], [Sch20],
[Sch18].
The∞-categories SpcG
∗and SpGare presentably symmetric monoidal and come equipped with a
symmetric monoidal left adjoint from SpcG, making them into commutative SpcG-algebras in PrL.
We may now use the fully faithful functor
−⊗SpcGΩSpcG: CAlgSpcG(PrL)֒→CAlg(PrL
G)
from Corollary 2.17to regard them as presentably symmetric monoidal G-categories:
Deﬁnition 4.2. We deﬁne presentably symmetric monoidal G-categories SpcG, SpcG
∗and SpGas
SpcG:= ΩSpcG,SpcG
∗:= SpcG
∗⊗SpcGΩSpcG,SpG:= SpG⊗SpcGΩSpcG,
called the G-categories of G-spaces,pointedG-spacesandgenuineG-spectra, respectively. We let
(−)+: SpcG→SpcG
∗and Σ∞
+: SpcG→SpG
denote the induced maps, which are the unit maps for the algebra st ructures of SpcG
∗and SpGin
PrL
G. Unwinding deﬁnitions, we see that these G-categories are given at a G-spaceBas follows:
7Running over allﬁnite-dimensional G-representations gives an equivalent ∞-category.
36•The∞-category SpcG(B) is the slice SpcG
/BofG-spaces over B.
•The∞-category SpcG
∗(B) is the relative tensor product SpcG
/B⊗SpcGSpcG
∗, which by [ Lur17,
Example 4.8.1.21] is equivalent to the ∞-category (SpcG
/B)∗ofretractive G-spacesoverB.
•The∞-category SpG(B) is the relative tensor product SpcG
/B⊗SpcGSpG. As SpGis pointed,
this is equivalent to the relative tensor product (SpcG
/B)∗⊗SpcG
∗SpG, which by Lemma 2.45
is in turn equivalent to (SpcG
/B)∗[{SV

/B)∗.
WhenB=G/His an orbit for some subgroup H/lessorequalslantG, there are equivalences
SpcG(G/H)≃SpcH,SpcG
∗(G/H)≃SpcH
∗,and SpG(G/H)≃SpH.
Indeed, the slice of SpcGoverG/His equivalent to SpcHby taking the ﬁber over eH, giving the
ﬁrst two equivalences. For the third equivalence, we observe that by Lemma 2.44the∞-category of
genuineH-spectra can be obtained from the ∞-category of pointed H-spaces by just inverting the
restricted representation spheres resG
H(SV) for irreducible G-representations V, as every irreducible
H-representation is a direct summand of the restriction to Hof an irreducible G-representation, see
Br¨ ocker and tom Dieck [ BtD95, Theorem 4.5].
TheG-categories SpcG, SpcG
∗and SpGadmit the following universal properties:
Proposition 4.3. LetCbe a presentably symmetric monoidal G-category.
(1) There exists a unique symmetric monoidal left adjoint G-functor F: SpcG→C;
(2) The G-functor Ffrom (1) extends to a symmetric monoidal left adjoint F′: SpcG
∗→Cif and
only ifC(1)is pointed, in which case the extension F′is unique.
(3) IfC(1)is pointed, the G-functor F′from (2) extends to a symmetric monoidal left adjoint
F′′: SpG→Cif and only if the functor F′(1): SpcG
∗→C(1)inverts the representation spheres
SV, in which case the extension F′′is unique.
Proof.Part (1) is immediate as SpcGis the monoidal unit of PrL
G. Parts (2) and (3) follow by
combining the adjunction from Corollary 2.17with the analogous universal properties of SpcG
∗≃
SpcG⊗Spc∗and SpG= SpcG
∗[{SV}−1] in PrL.
For aG-spaceB, the functor FB: SpcG
/B→C(B) from part (1) sends a morphism f:A→Bto the
objectf!1A∈C(B). The functor F′
B: (SpcG
/B)∗→C(B) sends a morphism f:A→Bwith section
s:B→Ato the coﬁber of 1B≃f!s!s∗1A→f!1AinC(B).
4.2 Twisted ambidexterity for genuine G-spectra
We continue to ﬁx a compact Lie group G. The presentably symmetric monoidal G-category SpGof
genuineG-spectra is ﬁberwise stable , meaning that it takes values in the subcategory PrL
st⊆PrLof
stable presentable ∞-categories. Moreover, one can show that SpGsatisﬁes twisted ambidexterity
37for all compact G-spaces. The goal of this section is to show that SpGis in a precise sense universal
with these two properties, see Theorem 4.9below.
We start by recalling a result of May and Sigurdsson [ MS06] on Costenoble-Waner duality for G-
spaces, based on ideas of Costenoble and Waner [ CW16].
Construction 4.4 (cf. [Sch18, Construction 3.2.7]) .LetH/lessorequalslantGbe a closed subgroup of the
compact Lie group G, and let L=TeH(G/H) denote the tangent H-representation of G/H. Choose
an embedding i:G/H ֒→VofG/Hinto a ﬁnite-dimensional orthogonal G-representation V, and
letW:=V−(di)eH(L) denote the orthogonal complement of the image of LinV. By scaling, we
may assume that the map j:G×HD(W)→Vgiven by [ g,w]/m⊣psto→g·(v0+w) is an embedding, where
D(W) is the unit disc of W; see [Bre72, Ch.0, Thm. 5.2, Ch. II, Cor. 5.2] for proofs that these
choices are possible. The map jgives rise to a G-equivariant collapse map c:SV→G+∧HSW.
Passing to genuine G-spectra and smashing with S−Vthen gives a map of genuine G-spectra
η:SG→G+∧H(S−V∧SW)≃G+∧HS−L.
Working in the G-category SpG, we may regard S−Las an object of SpH= SpG(G/H×1), and
similarly considering SH∈SpG(1×G/H) we see that G+∧HS−Lis equivalent to the composition
product S−L⊙SH∈SpG(1×1) = SpG.
Theorem 4.5 ([MS06, Theorem 18.6.5]) .LetH/lessorequalslantGbe a closed subgroup of a compact Lie group
G. Then the map η:SG→S−L⊙SHfrom Construction 4.4exhibitsS−L∈SpHas left Costenoble-
Waner dual to SH∈SpH.
Warning 4.6. May and Sigurdsson use diﬀerent foundations on parametrized sta ble homotopy
theory than we do, based on orthogonal spectrum objects in ret ractive topological spaces over B.
For this reason, we need to be careful when citing results from [ MS06]. Although one cannot strictly
speaking cite [ MS06, Theorem 18.6.5] in the case of Theorem 4.5, one observes that their proof
carries through verbatim in our setting: May and Sigurdsson const ruct the relevant duality data
already at the level of topological G-spaces using a notion of V-duality, see [MS06, Section 18.6],
and the same commutative diagrams prove Theorem 4.5.
Remark 4.7. Using Corollary 3.39, we see that the previous theorem is a parametrized strengthen-
ing of the well-known statement that the genuine G-spectrum Σ∞
+G/His dualizable with dual given
byG+∧HS−L. The correspondingtwisted normmap takesthe form indG
H(−⊗S−L)∼−−→coindG
H(−),
and is known as the Wirthm¨ uller isomorphism .
We can now prove our main result.
Theorem 4.8. LetGbe a compact Lie group and let Cbe a ﬁberwise stable presentably symmetric
monoidal G-category. Let F′: SpcG
∗→Cbe the unique symmetric monoidal left adjoint provided by
Proposition 4.3(2). Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) The functor F′(1): SpcG
∗→C(1)inverts the representation sphere SVfor every G-representation
V;
(2) The G-functor F′extends8to a symmetric monoidal left adjoint F′′: SpG→C;
8If an extension exists, it is necessarily unique.
38(3) For every pair of closed subgroups K/lessorequalslantH/lessorequalslantG, the map of G-spacesG/K→G/His twisted
C-ambidextrous;
(4) For every closed subgroup H/lessorequalslantG, the orbit G/His twistedC-ambidextrous;
(5) Every compact G-space is twistedC-ambidextrous;
(6) The functor F′(1): SpcG
∗→C(1)sends compact pointed G-spaces to dualizable objects.
If the group Gis ﬁnite, these conditions are moreover equivalent to:
(7) The G-categoryCisG-semiadditive, in the sense of [ Nar16, Deﬁnition 5.3];
(8) The G-categoryCisG-stable, in the sense of [ Nar16, Deﬁnition 7.1].
The condition in part (4) of the theorem says that for every closed subgroup H/lessorequalslantG, the twisted
norm map indG
H(−⊗DG/H)→coindG
H(−) is an equivalence of G-functorsCG/H→C. In light of
Remark 4.7, we may think of this condition as saying that Cadmits formal Wirthm¨ uller isomor-
phisms.
Proof.The implication (1) = ⇒(2) wastreated in Proposition 4.3. Forthe implication (2) = ⇒(3),
it suﬃces by Corollary 3.36to show that the morphism G/K→G/His twisted SpG-ambidextrous.
Identifying the slice SpcG
/(G/H)with the∞-category of H-spaces, the morphism G/K→G/H
corresponds to the H-spaceH/K, and thus we need to show that H/Kis twisted ambidextrous
for theH-category π∗
HSpG≃SpH. Using Proposition 3.29, this is an instance of Theorem 4.5,
applied to K/lessorequalslantH. The fact that (3) implies (4) is clear. The implication (4) = ⇒(5) follows
from Corollary 3.42, since every compact G-space is a retract of a ﬁnite G-CW-complex, and ﬁnite
G-CW-complexes are built from the orbits G/Husing ﬁnite colimits. The implication (5) = ⇒(6)
holds by Corollary 3.40, asF′(1)(B) is the coﬁber of the map 1→B!1Band dualizable objects in
C(1) are closed under coﬁbers. The implication (6) = ⇒(1) holds by Theorem B.1. This shows
that conditions (1)-(6) are equivalent.
IfGis a ﬁnite group, conditions (7) and (8) are equivalent since Cis already assumed to be ﬁberwise
stable. SinceCis in particular ﬁberwise semiadditive, it follows from Corollary 3.21that conditions
(3) and (7) are equivalent. This ﬁnishes the proof.
Theorem 4.9. LetGbe a compact Lie group. Then the G-category SpGis initial among ﬁberwise
stable presentably symmetric monoidal G-categoriesCsuch that all compact G-spaces are twisted
C-ambidextrous.
Proof.This is immediate from the equivalence between (2) and (5) in Theorem 4.8.
Theorem 4.10. LetGbe a ﬁnite group. Then the G-category SpGis the initial presentably sym-
metric monoidal G-category which is G-stable in the sense of [ Nar16].
Proof.This is immediate from the equivalence between (2) and (8) in Theorem 4.8.
394.3 Orbispectra
In this subsection, we will study a global analogue of the results est ablished in the previous sub-
section: instead of working only with subgroups of a ﬁxed compact L ie group G, we work with an
indexing category Orb containing all compact Lie groups and injective group homomorphisms.
The global orbit category
We start by recalling the deﬁnition of the global orbit category Orb.
Deﬁnition 4.11. Let TopGrpd1denote the ordinary category of topological groupoids. It is nat-
urally enriched over itself via the internal mapping objects. Using th e ﬁnite product preserving
geometric realization functor
|−|: TopGrpd1֒→sTop|−|−−→Top,
we obtain a topological enrichment on TopGrpd1. Explicitly, the geometric realization |G|of a
topological groupoid Gis given by the coend
|G|=/integraldisplay[n]∈∆
∆n×Gn∈Top,
where ∆ndenotes the topological n-simplex and where Gn=G1×G0G1×G0···×G0G1. We let
TopGrpd denote the homotopy coherent nerve of the topologically enriched category TopGrpd1.
Deﬁnition 4.12 (Global indexing category) .Given a topological group G, we letBGdenote the
associated one-object topological groupoid. We deﬁne the ∞-category Glo as the full subcategory
of TopGrpd spanned by the topological groupoids BGfor compact Lie groups G. We call Glo the
global indexing category .
Given compact Lie groups HandG, the mapping space Hom Glo(BH,BG) is the homotopy type
of the geometric realization of the topological groupoid Hom(BH,BG). This topological groupoid
is equivalent to the action groupoid of the topological G-space Hom Lie(H,G) of continuous group
homomorphisms from HtoG, withG-action given by conjugation. As a consequence, we get an
identiﬁcation
HomGlo(BH,BG)≃HomLie(H,G)hG∈Spc.
Deﬁnition 4.13 (Global orbit category) .We let Orb⊆Glo denote the wide subcategory, whose
morphism spaces
HomOrb(BH,BG)⊆HomGlo(BH,BG)
consist of those components corresponding to injective group homomorphisms H ֒→G. We call Orb
theglobal orbit category . We denote the presheaf category PSh(Orb) by OrbSpc and refe r to this as
the∞-category of orbispaces . We refer to OrbSpc-categories as orbicategories .
Remark 4.14. Our deﬁnitions of Glo and Orb agree with those of [ Rez14, 2.2] and [ LNP22, Deﬁ-
nition 6.1]. A close analogue of the deﬁnition was originally given by Gepne r and Henriques [ GH07,
Section 4.1] for arbitrary topological groups, where both Glo and O rb were denoted as Orb. A slight
diﬀerence with the deﬁnition of [ GH07] is that they use the fat realization||−||: TopGrpd→Top
as opposed to the usual (‘thin’) geometric realization. As ||−||does not preserve ﬁnite products
on the nose, deﬁning composition is slightly subtle, but when taking su ﬃcient care the resulting
∞-categories will be equivalent; see [ K¨ or18, Remark 3.10] for a more detailed discussion.
40Crucial for the comparison with equivariant homotopy theory for a compact Lie group Gis the
statement that the slice of Orb over BGis equivalent to the orbit category Orb GofG. This was
proved at the level of simplicially enriched categories by [ GM20, Proposition 2.15], and at the level
of∞-categories by [ LNP22, Lemma 6.13]. It follows that there is an equivalence of ∞-categories
SpcG≃OrbSpc/BG
between the∞-category of G-spaces and the∞-category of orbispaces over BG. Given a G-spaceA,
we denote its associated orbispace by A//G, so that∗//G=BG. By restricting along the functor
−//G: SpcG→OrbSpc, any orbicategory Chas an underlying G-category which we will denote by
π∗
GC.
The orbicategory of orbispectra
We will now deﬁne the orbicategory of orbispectra, informally given b y the assignment BG/m⊣psto→SpG,
and prove its universal property in terms of twisted ambidexterity .
Deﬁnition 4.15. Deﬁne the presentably symmetric monoidal orbicategories OrbSpc and OrbSpc ∗
oforbispaces resp.pointed orbispaces as
OrbSpc:= ΩOrbSpc, OrbSpc ∗:= OrbSpc∗⊗OrbSpcΩOrbSpc,
usingthefully faithful embedding −⊗OrbSpcΩOrbSpc: CAlgOrbSpc(PrL)֒→CAlg(PrL
Orb)fromPropo-
sition2.16. Explicitly, they are given at an orbispace Bby
OrbSpc(B) = OrbSpc/B, OrbSpc ∗(B) = (OrbSpc/B)∗.
Deﬁnition 4.16. We letS⊆OrbSpc ∗denote the subcategory spanned by those objects X∈
(OrbSpc/B)∗whose restriction along any map BG→Bcorresponds to a G-representation sphere
in (OrbSpc/BG)∗≃SpcG
∗. We deﬁne the presentably symmetric monoidal orbicategory OrbS pof
orbispectra as
OrbSp:=L(OrbSpc ∗,S)∈CAlg(PrL
Orb),
using Construction 2.43. We deﬁne the orbifunctor Σ∞: OrbSpc ∗→OrbSpas
Σ∞: OrbSpc ∗=L(OrbSpc ∗,∅)→L(OrbSpc ∗,S) = OrbSp .
We let OrbSp denote the underlying ∞-category of OrbSp , referred to as the ∞-category of orbis-
pectra. For an orbispace B, we also write OrbSp(B) for OrbSp (B) and call it the ∞-category of
orbispectra parametrized over B.
Pardon [ Par23] has previously deﬁned a notion of orbispectra in the setting of top ological stacks.
Although his deﬁnition seems close in spirit to our deﬁnition, the precis e mathematical connection
is not known to the author.
Proposition 4.17. The orbicategory OrbSpis presentably symmetric monoidal and the orbifunctor
Σ∞: OrbSpc ∗→OrbSpexhibits it as the formal inversion of the representation sp heres inOrbSpc ∗.
Proof.This is an instance of Proposition 2.46. The condition (∗) of that proposition is satisﬁed: for
a closed subgroup H/lessorequalslantG, every irreducible H-representation is a direct summand of the restriction
toHof an irreducible G-representation, see Br¨ ocker and tom Dieck [ BtD95, Theorem 4.5].
41The orbicategory OrbSp recovers the G-category SpGof genuine G-spectra for every compact Lie
groupG:
Lemma 4.18. For every compact Lie group G, theG-category π∗
GOrbSpunderlying the orbicategory
OrbSpof orbispectra is equivalent to the G-category SpGof genuine G-spectra.
Proof.Both come equipped with a symmetric monoidal left adjoint from SpcG
∗exhibiting them as
formal inversions of the G-representation spheres. For SpGthis is by Proposition 2.38, while for
π∗
GOrbSpthis is by Proposition 2.47.
Remark 4.19. The functor OrbSp : Orbop→CAlg(PrL) is the restriction along Orb ֒→Glo of
the functor Sp•: Gloop→CAlg(PrL) constructed by [ LNP22, Section 10]. Indeed, they con-
struct a natural transformation Σ∞
•:S•,∗→Sp•, where the functor S•,∗: Gloop→Cat∞con-
structed in [ LNP22, Construction 6.16] restricts to the functor OrbSpc ∗using the natural equiva-
lence PSh(Orb /−)≃PSh(Orb) /−. Furthermore, it is shown in [ LNP22, Proposition 10.5] that this
transformation Σ∞
•is pointwise given by the standard suspension spectrum functor Sp cG
∗→SpG,
so that it exhibits its target as a pointwise formal inversion of its sou rce.
From the results of Section 4.2we may deduce a universal property of OrbSp in terms of twisted
ambidexterity. To this end, recall that a morphism f:A→Bin an∞-topos is called relatively
compact ifforeverycompactobject KinBandeverymorphism K→B, thepullback A×BK→Kis
a compact object in the slice B/K(or equivalently in Bby [GHK22, Lemma 3.1.5]). If B= PSh(T) is
a presheaftopos, it suﬃces to checkthis when Kis a representableobject. In particular, a morphism
of orbispaces f:A→Bis relatively compact if and only if for every compact Lie group Gand every
mapBG→Bof orbispaces, the pullback A×BBGcorresponds to a compact G-space.
Proposition 4.20. LetCbe a ﬁberwise stable presentably symmetric monoidal orbica tegory. Then
the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) The unique symmetric monoidal left adjoint F′: OrbSpc ∗→Cinverts the representation spheres:
for every compact Lie group Gand every G-representation V,F(SV)∈C(BG)is invertible;
(2) The functor F′: OrbSpc ∗→ Cextends (necessarily uniquely) to a symmetric monoidal lef t
adjointF′: OrbSp→C;
(3) For every compact Lie group Gand every compact G-spaceA, the map A//G→∗//G=BGof
orbispaces is twisted C-ambidextrous;
(4) Every relatively compact morphism f:A→Bof orbispaces is twisted C-ambidextrous.
Proof.The equivalence between (1) and (2) is immediate from the universal property of OrbSp .
Note that condition (1) is satisﬁed if and only if each of the G-functors π∗
GF′:π∗
GOrbSpc ∗→π∗
GC
satisﬁes condition (1) of Theorem 4.8, while (3) is satisﬁed if and only if the G-category π∗
GCsatisﬁes
condition (5) of Theorem 4.8, so the equivalence between (1) and (3) holds by applying Theorem 4.8
totheG-category π∗
GCforevery G. Theequivalencebetween(3)and(4)holdsbyProposition 3.13(5)
and the above characterization of relatively compact morphisms in O rbSpc.
Theorem 4.21. The orbicategory OrbSpis initial among ﬁberwise stable presentably symmetric
monoidal orbicategories Csuch that every relatively compact morphism of orbispaces i s twistedC-
ambidextrous.
42Proof.This is immediate from the equivalence between (2) and (4) in the prev ious proposition.
4.4 Proper equivariant stable homotopy theory
For a Lie group G, not assumed to be compact, Degrijse et al. [ DHL+23] introduced an∞-category
SpGofproper genuine G-spectra. Inthissubsection,wewillseethatthis ∞-categorycanbeidentiﬁed
with the∞-category of orbispectra parametrized over a certain orbispace BG. As an application,
we show that when Ghasenough bundle representations , the∞-category SpGmay be obtained
from the∞-category of pointed proper G-spaces by inverting the sphere bundles Sξassociated to
ﬁnite-dimensional vector bundles ξoverBG, see Proposition 4.34.
Deﬁnition 4.22. For a Lie group G, we deﬁne its proper orbit category as the full subcategory
Orbpr
G⊆OrbGspanned by the orbits G/Kfor compact subgroups K/lessorequalslantG. We deﬁne the ∞-
category SpcG
profproperG-spacesas the presheaf category PSh(Orbpr
G). AproperG-category is a
SpcG
pr-category, equivalently encoded by a functor (Orbpr
G)op→Cat∞.
We start by identifying the ∞-category of proper G-spaces with a slice of the ∞-category of orbis-
paces.
Deﬁnition 4.23 (Classifying orbispace of a Lie group) .In analogy with Orb ⊆TopGrpd, we deﬁne
the∞-category Orb′⊆TopGrpd as the (non-full) subcategory whose objects are the on e-point
topological groupoids BGfor (not necessarily compact) Lie groups G, and whose mapping spaces
HomOrb′(BH,BG)⊆HomTopGrpd(BH,BG)≃HomLie(H,G)hG
consist of those path components corresponding to injective continuous group homomorphisms H→
G. It is immediate that Orb′contains Orb. Given a Lie group G, we deﬁne its classifying orbispace
BGas the composite
BG: Orbop֒→(Orb′)opHomOrb′(−,BG)−−−−−−−−−−→ Spc.
Note that when Gis compact, this is just the representable presheaf on BG∈Orb.
Construction 4.24. For a Lie group G, let Orb /BGdenote the full subcategory of Orb′
/BGspanned
by the morphisms of the form BK→BGfor compact subgroups K/lessorequalslantG. At the level of topological
categories, one can deﬁne a topologically enriched functor from Or bGto Orb′by sending an orbit
G/HtoBH, which induces a functor of ∞-categories between their homotopy coherent nerves. As
OrbGadmits a terminal object G/G, this canonically gives rise to a functor Orb G→Orb′/BG,
which is easily seen to restrict to a functor Orbpr
G→Orb/BG.
Lemma 4.25. For a Lie group G, the above functor Orbpr
G→Orb/BGis an equivalence.
Proof.We will argue just like [ LNP22, Lemma 6.13]. The functor is essentially surjective by deﬁni-
tion, so we must show it is fully faithful. Consider two objects G/HandG/Kin Orbpr
G, where we
(non-canonically)chooserepresentatives H,K⊆Gofthe conjugacyclasses[ H] and[K]ofsubgroups
ofG. We have to show that the square
(G/H)KHomTopGrpd(BK,BH) Hom( H,K)hK
∗ HomTopGrpd(BK,BG) Hom Lie(H,G)hG≃
≃
43is homotopy cartesian. The argument for this is identical to that of [LNP22, Lemma 6.13], so we will
not repeat it here. Note that the quotient map G→G/C(H) used in that proof is still a ﬁbration,
as it is a locally trivial ﬁber bundle by [ Pal61, Corollary 4.1].
Corollary 4.26. For every Lie group G, there is an equivalence OrbSpc/BG≃SpcG
prbetween the
∞-category of orbispaces over BGand the∞-category of proper G-spaces.
Proof.By Lemma 4.25, there is an equivalence SpcG
pr= PSh(Orbpr
G)≃PSh(Orb /BG). The∞-
category Orb /BGis equivalent to the subcategory of OrbSpc/BGspanned by the maps BK→BGfor
compact Lie groups K, since both embed fully faithfully into PSh(Orb′)/BGwith the same image.
It follows that there is an equivalence PSh(Orb /BG)≃OrbSpc/BG, ﬁnishing the proof.
Deﬁnition 4.27. LetGbe a Lie group. By restricting along the forgetful functor SpcG
pr≃
OrbSpc/BGfgt−−→OrbSpc, any orbicategory Cgives rise to a proper G-category π∗
G. We deﬁne the
properG-category of proper genuine G-spectraSpGas
SpG:=π∗
GOrbSp,
the underlying proper G-category of the orbicategoryof orbispectra. When Gis compact this agrees
with the G-∞-category of genuine G-spectra SpGby Lemma 4.18.
Proposition 4.28 (Linskens-Nardin-Pol [ LNP22, Theorem 12.11]) .For every Lie group G, the
underlying∞-category of the proper G-category SpGis equivalent to the ∞-category SpGof proper
genuineG-spectra deﬁned by [ DHL+23].
Proof.The underlying∞-category of SpGis given as the limit of the functor SpG: (Orbpr
G)op→
Cat∞. By Remark 4.19, this functor is equivalent to the composite
(Orbpr
G)op≃Orbop
/BG→Orbop֒→GloopSp•−−→Cat∞.
The limit of this diagram was shown by [ LNP22, Theorem 12.11] to be equivalent to SpG, ﬁnishing
the proof.
Corollary 4.29. The proper G-category SpGsatisﬁes twisted ambidexterity for all relatively compact
morphisms of proper G-spaces. In particular, if H/lessorequalslantGis a cocompact subgroup, meaning that G/H
is a compact topological space, then there is a formal Wirthm ¨ uller isomorphism
indG
H(−⊗DG/H)≃coindG
H(−): SpH→SpG.
Proof.The ﬁrst statement is immediate as SpGis the restriction of the orbicategory OrbSp to
the slice Orb /BGand OrbSp satisﬁes twisted ambidexterity for all relatively compact morphisms of
orbispaces. Thesecondstatement followsfromthe observationt hat the mapoforbispaces BH→BG
is relatively compact, by compactness of G/H.
Theorem 4.30. The proper G-category SpGis the initial ﬁberwise stable presentably symmetric
monoidal proper G-category satisfying twisted ambidexterity for all relati vely compact morphisms of
properG-spaces.
44Proof.Just like in Proposition 4.20, one deduces from Theorem 4.8that twisted ambidexterity for
relatively compact morphisms of proper G-spaces is equivalent to the invertibility of representation
spheres. The claim follows, since SpGis a formal inversion of representation spheres in SpcG
∗by
Proposition 2.47.
Enough bundle representations
Our results on formal inversions allow us to prove that in certain cas es the∞-category of proper
genuineG-spectra may be obtained from the ∞-category of pointed proper G-spaces by inverting
the sphere bundles of vector bundles over BG.
Deﬁnition 4.31. Let Rep: Orbop→Cat∞denote the functor which sends BGto the ordinary
category of ﬁnite-dimensional G-representations. We may limit-extend this to a functor
Vect: OrbSpcop→Cat∞,
and we refer to Vect( B) as the category of vector bundles over B. We say that an orbispace Bhas
enough bundle representations if for any compact Lie group G, any map of orbispaces BG→B
and any G-representation V, there exists a vector bundle ξ∈Vect(B) such that the restriction
ξ|BG∈Vect(BG) = Rep( G) contains Vas a direct summand.
Example 4.32. For every compact Lie group G,BGhas enough bundle representations by Br¨ ocker
and tom Dieck [ BtD95, Theorem 4.5].
Example 4.33. LetGbe a discrete group and assume that BGis a ﬁnite orbispace, that is, it lies
in the subcategory of OrbSpc generated under ﬁnite colimits by the BKfor compact Lie groups K.
ThenBGhas enough bundle representations. Indeed, under the identiﬁca tion OrbSpc/BG≃SpcG
pr,
the orbispace BGcorresponds to the universal proper G-spaceEG, and by the assumption this is
a ﬁnite proper G-CW-complex. Given a ﬁnite subgroup K/lessorequalslantG, the unique map ϕ:G/K→EG
is a map of ﬁnite proper G-CW-complexes, hence by L¨ uck and Oliver [ LO01, Lemma 3.7] any K-
representation is a direct summand of the restriction along ϕof aG-vector bundle VoverEG. Since
Vin particular gives rise to a vector bundle over the orbispace BG, this ﬁnishes the proof.
For every compact Lie group Gand every G-representation V, we may consider its associated
representation sphere SV∈SpcG,∗≃OrbSpc(BG)∗. Since this assignment is functorial in both V
andG, we obtain a natural transformation S(−): Rep→OrbSpc(B−)∗of functors Orbop→Cat∞,
which uniquely extends to a natural transformation S(−): Vect→OrbSpc ∗of functors OrbSpcop→
Cat∞.
Proposition 4.34. Assume the orbispace Bhas enough bundle representations. Then the ∞-
category OrbSp(B) of orbispectra parametrized over Bis equivalent to the formal inversion of sphere
bundles{Sξ|ξ∈Vect(B)}in the∞-category (OrbSpc/B)∗of retractive orbispaces over B:
OrbSp(B)≃(OrbSpc/B)∗[{Sξ}−1].
Proof.LetB= OrbSpc/Bbe the∞-topos of orbispaces over B. By Proposition 2.47, theB-
functorπ∗
BOrbSpc ∗→π∗
BOrbSpis a formal inversion of the representation spheres SV∈SpcG
∗≃
45π∗
BOrbSpc ∗(BG) for every compact Lie group Gand a map of orbispaces BG→B. By the as-
sumption that Bhas enough bundle representations, the parametrized subcateg ory of represen-

A Symmetric monoidal unstraightening
LetBbe an∞-topos and letO⊗be an∞-operad. In this appendix, we recall unstraightening
techniques from Lurie [ Lur17] and Drew and Gallauer [ DG22, Appendix A] to describe O-algebras
in the∞-category Cat(B) ofB-categories in terms of suitable cocartesian ﬁbrations.
Recall from [ Lur17, 2.1.2.13] that an O⊗-monoidal∞-category is an∞-categoryC⊗equipped with
a cocartesian ﬁbration p⊗:C⊗→O⊗such that the composition C⊗→O⊗→Fin∗exhibitsC⊗
as an∞-operad. AnO-monoidal functor is a morphism of operads over O⊗which preservesO⊗-
cocartesian edges. We let CatO⊗
∞⊆CAlg(Cat ∞)/O⊗denote the (non-full) subcategory of O⊗-
monoidal∞-categories.
Proposition A.1 ([DG22, Corollary A.12]) .LetO⊗=Bop,⊔:= (Bop)⊔denote the symmetric
monoidal category corresponding to Bopequipped with the cocartesian monoidal structure. Then
straightening/unstraightening induces an equivalence
CatBop,⊔
∞≃Fun(Bop,CAlg(Cat ∞)).
Given a functorC:Bop→CAlg(Cat ∞), the resultingBop,⊔-monoidal∞-category p⊗:C⊠→Bop,⊔
may informally be described as follows:
•The objects ofC⊠are pairs ( B,X) whereBis an object inB, andXis an object inC(B).
•Amorphism( B,X)→(B′,X′) inC⊠consists ofa morphism f:B′→BinB, and a morphism
f∗X→X′inC(B′).
•The tensor product of ( B,X) and (B′,X′) is the “external product”
X⊠X′:= pr∗
BX⊗B×B′pr∗
B′X′∈ C(B×B′),
where prB:B×B′→Band prB′:B×B′→B′are the canonical projections in B.
Conversely, if p⊗:C⊠→Bop,⊔is aBop,⊔-monoidal∞-category, we may straighten the underlying
cocartesian ﬁbration p: (C⊠)1→Bopto a functorC:Bop→Cat∞, sending B∈Bto the ﬁber of
poverB. The symmetric monoidal structure on this ﬁber C(B) may be described as follows: given
46X,X′∈C(B), their tensor product is the object ∆∗(X⊠X′) where ∆ denotes the diagonal map
B→B×BinB.
As there is an equivalence Fun( Bop,CAlg(Cat ∞))≃CAlg(Fun(Bop,Cat∞)), it follows from Propo-
sitionA.1that we may regard every symmetric monoidal B-categoryC∈CAlg(Cat(B)) as a co-
cartesian ﬁbration C⊠→Bop,⊔. We will now discuss how one may describe O-algebras in Cat(B)
for an arbitrary∞-operadO⊗in a similar fashion.
Deﬁnition A.2. We deﬁne the∞-operadBop,Ovia the following pullback diagram:
Bop,OBop,⊔
O⊗Fin∗.q p
Being the pullback of a cocartesian ﬁbration, the map q:Bop,O→O⊗is a cocartesian ﬁbration.
Proposition A.3. There is an equivalence
AlgO(Fun(Bop,Cat∞))≃CatBop,O
∞,
natural inO⊗, which forO⊗=Comm⊗reduces to the equivalence of Proposition A.1.
Proof.This follows from the following equivalences:
AlgO(Fun(Bop,Cat∞))≃Fun(Bop,AlgO(Cat∞))
≃AlgBop,O(Cat∞) [ Lur17, Theorem 2.4.3.18]
≃CatBop,O
∞. [Lur17, Remark 2.4.2.6]
ForO⊗=Comm⊗, this reduces to the equivalence of Proposition A.1given in [ DG22, Corol-
lary A.12].
We are mainly interested in the case O⊗=LM⊗in order to describe left C-modules in Cat(B).
Corollary A.4. ConsiderC∈CAlg(Cat(B))and letC⊠∈CatBop,⊔
∞denote the associated Bop,⊔-
monoidal∞-category. The equivalence of Proposition A.3restricts to an equivalence
LMod C(Fun(Bop,Cat∞))≃CatBop,LM
∞×CatBop,⊔
∞{C⊠}.
The full subcategory LMod C(Cat(B))of the left-hand side is equivalent to a full subcategory of t he
right-hand side spanned by those Bop,LM-monoidal∞-categoriesM⊠→Bop,LMwhose pullback
along the inclusion Bop֒→Bop,LMis corresponds to a B-category (i.e., its straightening Bop→Cat∞
preserves limits).
From this description of C-modules in Cat( B) in terms of cocartesian ﬁbrations, we can deduce a
non-parametrized criterion for a C-linearB-functor F:D→Eto have aC-linear right adjoint.9
9In this appendix, contrary to the convention used in the body of the text, C-linearB-functors are not assumed to
preserve colimits.
47Proposition A.5. LetCbe a symmetric monoidal B-category, letDandEbeB-categories tensored
overC, and let F:D→Ebe aC-linear functor. Assume that Fadmits a parametrized right adjoint
G:E→Dsatisfying the following projection formula: for every B∈B, everyC∈C(B)and every
E∈E(B), the map C⊗BG(E)→G(C⊗BE)adjoint to the composite
F(C⊗BG(E))≃C⊗BF(G(E))C⊗Bunit−−−−−−→ C⊗BE
is an equivalence in D(B). Then the right adjoint Gadmits canonical C-linear structure and the
adjunction enhances to an adjunction in ModC(Cat(B)).
Proof.By Corollary A.4, we may identify the C-module structures on DandEwith cocartesian
ﬁbrations overBop,LMwhose restriction to Bop,⊔isC⊠. The map Fthus corresponds to a map
D⊠E⊠
Bop,LMF⊠
of cocartesian ﬁbrations. If F:D→E has a parametrized right adjoint, then in particular F⊠
has ﬁberwise right adjoints, and by [ Lur17, Proposition 7.3.2.1] these assemble into a relative right
adjointG⊠:E⊠→ D⊠overBop,LMwhich moreover is a map of ∞-operads. In particular G
preserves inert maps. Our goal is to show that Gin fact preserves all cocartesian edges. By the
product description of the mapping spaces in an ∞-operad, we may restrict attention to cocartesian
morphism inE⊠whose target lies over /⊣n}br⊣cketle{t1/⊣n}br⊣cketri}ht∈Fin∗. Given such morphism, let ( B1,...,B n)→Bbe
the image inBop,LM.10This map is a composite of two maps ( B1,...,B n)→B1×···×Bn→B,
so we may assume without loss of generality that either n= 1 or that the map is cocartesian for
the cocartesian ﬁbration Bop,LM→Fin∗. Whenn= 1, this is just the condition that G:E→Dis
a parametrized functor, by assumption on F. So assume the map ( B1,...,B n)→Bis cocartesian
forBop,LM→Fin∗. When Blies over a∈LM, the claim is clear since Fis the identity over
Assoc⊆LM. So we may assume without loss of generality that Blies over m∈LM, and moreover
thatBnlies over mwhile all the other Bilie overa. By induction, we may assume that n= 2, so
that the map inBop,LMtakes the form ( B1,B1)→B1×B2and lies over the map ( a,m)→min
LM. A cocartesian edge in E⊠over this map has the form ( C,E)→C⊠E. The condition that the
induced map G(C,E) = (C,G(E))→G(C⊠E) is again cocartesian is equivalent to the condition
that the map C⊠G(E)→G(C⊠E) is an equivalence in D(A×B). Since for C∈C(A),E∈E(B)
andE′∈E(A) there are equivalences
C⊠E≃π∗
AC⊗A×Bπ∗
BE
C⊗AE′≃∆A∗(C⊠E′),
andsince Gcommuteswith basechange, it followsthat thisconditionis equivalent tothe assumption
onG.
B Duality in equivariant stable homotopy theory
LetGbe a compact Lie group. In his PhD dissertation, Campion [ Cam23] proved a universal
propertyofthe∞-categorySpGofgenuine G-spectra: thesuspensionspectrumfunctorΣ∞: SpcG
∗→
10This notation is abusive: the LM⊗-component is hidden in the notation.
48SpGin CAlg(PrL) is initial among symmetric monoidal left adjoints F: SpcG
∗→Dinto a stable
presentably symmetric monoidal ∞-categoryDsuch that F(X) is dualizable for every compact
pointedG-spaceX. Since we know from [ GM20, Corollary C.7] that Σ∞is initial among functors
Fthatinvert representation spheres , the crux of Campion’s result is that these two conditions on
F: SpcG
∗→Dare in fact equivalent:
Theorem B.1 (cf. Campion [ Cam23, Section 5]) .LetGbe a compact Lie group, let D∈CAlg(PrL
st)
be a stable presentably symmetric monoidal ∞-category, and let F: SpcG
∗→ Dbe a symmetric
monoidal left adjoint. Then the following are equivalent:
(1) For every orthogonal G-representation V, the functor Fsends the representation sphere SVto
an invertible object of D;
(2) For every compact pointed G-spaceX∈SpcG
∗, the object F(X)is dualizable inD;
(3) For every orthogonal G-representation V, the functor Fsends the representation sphere SVto
a dualizable object of D.
For completeness, we will include a proof of this theorem. While we pre sent both the statement and
the proof slightly diﬀerently, the core ideas are taken from Campion ’s thesis [ Cam23]. The ﬁrst core
idea is that certain dualizable objects are already close to being inver tible:
Deﬁnition B.2 (Campion [ Cam23, Deﬁnition 2.1.2]) .LetDbe a presentably symmetric monoidal
∞-category, let T∈Dbe an object and let t:T→Tbe an endomorphism of T. We say that T
hast-twisted trivial braiding if the twist morphism σT,T:T⊗T→T⊗Tis homotopic to the map
1⊗t:T⊗T→T⊗T.
Proposition B.3 (cf. Campion [ Cam23, Proposition 2.3.1]) .LetT∈Dbe a dualizable object.
Assume that Thast-twisted trivial braiding for some endomorphism t:T→T. Then the morphism
T⊗T∨⊗T1⊗ev−−−→T
is an equivalence.
Proof.Since 1⊗evTalways admits a right-inverse given by coev T⊗1:T→T⊗T∨⊗T, it remains
to show that 1⊗evTalso admits a left-inverse. We claim that in fact already the evaluation map
evTitself admits a left-inverse, given by the following composite:
1Dcoev−−−→T⊗T∨t⊗T∨
−−−→T⊗T∨σT,T∨−−−−→T∨⊗T.
Indeed, this follows from the following string diagram:
T T∨
t
T∨Tε
η
σT,T∨≃T T∨
t
T∨Tεη
σT,T∨(1)≃T T∨
T∨Tεη
σT,T∨σT,T
≃T T∨
T∨Tεη≃T T∨
T∨T
49Here we have abbreviated ε= evTandη= coev T. Each of the ﬁve diagrams represents a composite
of morphisms in D, where each downward pointing arrow denotes a tensor factor of Twhile an
upward pointing arrow denotes a tensor factor of T∨. For example, the third diagram is to be read
as the following composite:
T∨⊗T1⊗η−−→T∨⊗T⊗T⊗T∨1⊗σT,T⊗1−−−−−−−→ T∨⊗T⊗T⊗T∨1⊗σT,T∨−−−−−−→ T∨⊗T⊗T∨⊗Tε⊗1−−→T∨⊗T.
The equivalence labelled (1) holds because of the assumption that Thas at-twisted trivial braiding.
The other equivalences are easy manipulations of string diagrams. T his ﬁnishes the proof.
Lemma B.4 (Campion [ Cam23, Example 2.1.6]) .For every G-representation V, the representation
sphereSV∈SpcG
∗has(−1)-twisted trivial braiding, where −1:SV→SV:v/m⊣psto→−v.
Proof.Consider the family of linear G-equivariant maps H: [0,1]→EndG(V×V) sending tto the
matrix
/parenleftbigg−sin(π
2t) cos(π
2t)
cos(π
2t) sin(π
2t)/parenrightbigg
:V×V→V×V.
We have H0(v1,v2) = (v2,v1) andH1(v1,v2) = (−v1,v2). Since Htis invertible at all times, it
induces a pointed map SHt:SV×V→SV×V. AsSV×V∼=SV∧SV, it follows that the twist map of
SVin SpcG
∗is homotopic to the map ( −1)∧id as desired.
To continue, we need the notion of G-spaces concentrated at a single conjugacy class. We ﬁx a
compact Lie group Gand a conjugacy class ( H) of subgroups of G.
Deﬁnition B.5. We say that a pointed G-spaceX∈SpcG
∗isconcentrated at Hif we have XK=∗
for any subgroup K⊆Gthat is not in the conjugacy class of H.
LetW=WG(H) =NG(H)/Hdenote the Weyl group of HinG. Observe that the full subcategory
of the orbit category Orb Gspanned by G/His equivalent to the classifying space BWofW, asW
is equivalent to the endomorphism space of G/Hin Orb G. It follows that the H-ﬁxed point functor
(−)H: SpcG
∗= Fun(Orb G,Spc∗)→Fun(BW ,Spc∗) becomes an equivalence when restricted to the
pointedG-spaces concentrated at H.
We letS{H}denote a copy of S0concentrated at Hcorresponding:
(S{H})K=/braceleftBigg
S0Kconjugate to H;
∗otherwise.
Note that the functor −∧S{H}: SpcG
∗→SpcG
∗is a localization onto the pointed G-spaces concen-
trated at H.
Lemma B.6. LetVbe aG-representation and let n:= dim(VH). Then there is an equivalence of
pointedG-spacesSV∧S{H}∧G/H+≃Σn(S{H}∧G/H+).
Proof.Since both sides are concentrated at H, the equivalence can be checked after forgetting to
Fun(BW,Spc∗) after passing to H-ﬁxed points. As the H-ﬁxed points of G/H+areW+, this follows
from the sequence of equivalences
(SV)H∧W+≃SVH∧W+≃Sn∧W+= Σn(W+).
50Here the second equivalence uses the shear isomorphism for W-spaces, using that the underlying
pointed space of SVHisSn.
We are now ready for the proof of Theorem B.1.
Proof of Theorem B.1.LetF: SpcG
∗→Dbe a symmetric monoidal left adjoint as in the statement
of the theorem. We prove that 1), 2) and 3) are equivalent. The imp lication (2) =⇒(3) is
obvious. For the implication (1) = ⇒(2), note that (1) implies by the universal property of
SpG= (SpcG
∗)[{SV}−1] thatFuniquely extends to a symmetric monoidal left adjoint /tildewideF: SpG→D.
Since the suspension functor Σ∞
+: SpcG
∗→SpGsends compact G-spaces to dualizable objects, the
same follows for F.
It remains to show that 3) implies 1). Let Vbe aG-representation and assume that F(SV) is dualiz-
able. To prove that F(SV) is invertible, we need to show that the evaluation map ev F(SV):F(SV)⊗
D(F(SV))→1Dis an equivalence, or equivalently that the coﬁber
Q:= coﬁb( F(SV)⊗D(F(SV))evF(SV)−−−−−→ 1D)
is zero inD. We will inductively show that Q⊗F(X) is zero for a large family of G-spacesX.
Step 1:We have seen in Lemma B.4thatX=SVhas twisted trivial braiding, and since the functor
Fissymmetricmonoidalitfollowsthat F(SV)alsohastwisted-trivialbraiding. Proposition B.3then
gives us that the map ev F(SV):F(SV)⊗D(F(SV))→1Dbecomes an equivalence after tensoring
withF(SV). In particular, Q⊗F(SV) = 0.
Step 2: We will show that Q⊗F(S{H}) = 0 for every subgroup HofG. By step 1, we know
thatQ⊗F(SV∧S{H}∧G/H+)≃Q⊗F(SV)⊗F(S{H}∧G/H+) = 0. From the equivalence of
LemmaB.6and exactness of Q⊗F(−), it follows that
0 =Q⊗F(SV∧S{H}∧G/H+)≃Σn(Q⊗F(S{H}∧G/H+)),
so that also Q⊗F(S{H}∧G/H+) = 0 by stability of D. SinceQ⊗F(−) commutes with homotopy
orbits, we get
Q⊗F(S{H})≃Q⊗F/parenleftBig
(S{H}∧G/H+)hW/parenrightBig
≃/parenleftBig
Q⊗F(S{H}∧G/H+)/parenrightBig
hW= 0.
Step 3:We show that Q= 0. For a family Fof subgroups of Gwe letEFdenote the universal
G-space withF-isotropy, characterized by the property that
(EF)K=/braceleftBigg
∗K∈F;
∅otherwise.
We letEF,+:= (EF)+. ConsiderUbe the poset of all families Fof subgroups of Gfor which
Q⊗F(EF,+) = 0. Our goal is to show that the family of allsubgroups is contained in U, as in that
case we have EF,+=S0so thatQ⊗F(EF,+) =Q⊗F(S0)≃Q⊗1D≃Q.
Note thatUcontainsF=∅sinceEF=∅andQ⊗F(−) preserves the initial object. Furthermore,
for a chainF1⊆F2⊆F3⊆...of nested families in Uwith unionF, we have EF= colim iEFi, as
is easily checked on K-ﬁxed points for every K/lessorequalslantG. AsQ⊗F(−) preserves colimits, it follows that
51alsoF∈U. ThusUsatisﬁes the conditions of Zorn’s lemma and thus contains a maximal e lement
Fm.
We claim thatFmmust contain all subgroups of G. Assume that a subgroup His not contained
inFm. Since the poset of subgroups of Gis well-founded, we may assume that His minimal with
this property, i.e. every strict subgroup of His inFm. We now deﬁneF′as the family of subgroups
either contained in Fmor conjugate to H. This is indeed a family by assumption on H. We then
have a coﬁber sequence
EFm,+→EF′,+→S{H}.
in SpcG
∗. SinceQ⊗F(−) preserves coﬁber sequences, the sequence
Q⊗F(EFm,+)→Q⊗F(EF′,+)→Q⊗F(S{H})
is again a coﬁber sequence in D. SinceFm∈U, the left term is zero, and by step 2) also the
right term is zero. It follows that the middle term is zero and thus F′∈U. This contradicts the
maximality ofFm. We conclude that Hmust have already be contained in Fmand thus thatFm
contains all subgroups of G. This ﬁnishes the proof of the implication (3) = ⇒(1), thus ﬁnishing
the proof of the theorem.
