Abstract —Near field computational imaging has been recog-
nized as a promising technique for non-destructive and highly
accurate detection of the target. Meanwhile, reconfigurable in-
telligent surface (RIS) can flexibly control the scattered electro-
magnetic (EM) fields for sensing the target and can thus help
computational imaging in the near field. In this paper, we propose
a near-field imaging scheme based on holograghic aperture RIS
for both 2D and 3D targets. Specifically, we first establish an end-
to-end EM propagation model from the perspective of Maxwell
equations. To mitigate the inherent ill conditioning of the inverse
problem in the imaging system, we design the EM field patterns
as masks that help translate the inverse problem into a forward
problem. Next, we utilize RIS to generate different virtual EM
masks on the target and calculate the cross-correlation between
the mask patterns and the electric field strength at the receiver.
We then provide a RIS design scheme for virtual EM masks by
employing a regularization technique. The cross-range resolution
of the proposed method is analyzed based on the spatial spectrum
of the generated masks. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method can produce satisfactory imaging results for
both 2D and 3D targets. Moreover, the imaging quality can be
improved by generating more virtual EM masks, by increasing
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver, or by placing the
target closer to the RIS.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Electromagnetic (EM) imaging technology is non-contact,
non-invasive, and could provide high-resolution images of the
object [1]–[5]. EM imaging can be used for inspection and
visualization of the human body, which meets the increasing
demands from social security, rescue activity, and medical
applications. Conventional EM imaging techniques include
optimization-based imaging [6], confocal radar-based imaging
[7], and EM tomography [8]. In optimization-based imaging,
the exact nonlinear diffraction relation between the measured
scattered field and the complex permittivity is found iteratively

transmitted to detect strong scatterers inside the inspected
region [7]. In EM tomography, the transmitted signals in
multiple planes intersect the imaged object and are used to
reconstruct 2D slice images in different planes [10]. However,
conventional EM imaging typically demands changeable EM
sources such as scanning antennas and dynamic metasurface
antennas [11], [12]. When the EM source is unchangeable,
conventional EM imaging methods may not be applicable. In
this case, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has recently
been used to reflect EM waves from the source and generate
multiple probing signals in imaging systems [13].
The use of RIS for imaging has several advantages. Firstly,
RIS is a flexible and cost-effective solution that can be easily
integrated into existing imaging systems [14]–[17]. Secondly,
RIS can operate over a wide range of frequencies, e.g., from
GHz waves to THz waves, making it suitable for a variety
of applications [18]–[23]. Thirdly, by precisely controlling
the wavefront of EM waves, RIS can potentially enhance the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the resolution of the imaging
system [13], [24]–[27].
However, most existing literature about near-field imaging
applies discrete aperture RIS, which can not achieve high
spatial resolution and energy efficiency. Holographic aperture
RIS, in particular, could alter the reflection coefficients con-
tinuously and could generate complex wavefronts with a high
degree of control and flexibility [28]–[30]. As a result, the
holographic aperture RIS can potentially provide even higher
resolution and accuracy in near-field imaging [31], [32].
Despite these promising advantages, the use of holographic
RIS for near-field imaging is still a relatively new area and
faces many challenges, including optimizing the design and
configuration of the holographic RIS to achieve the desired
imaging performance, as well as developing effective signal
processing algorithms to extract useful information from the
received signals. A more intractable challenge is the inherent
ill conditioning of the inverse problem in the imaging system,
which brings numerical errors and large computation overhead.
Therefore, while there is much excitement surrounding the po-
tential applications of holographic RIS in near-field imaging,
more investigation is needed to fully understand its capabilities
and restrictions.
In this paper, we develop a novel imaging scheme that
utilizes RIS to build virtual EM masks on the target. The
method is applicable to both 2D and 3D objects. Specifically,
we first establish an end-to-end EM propagation model from
the perspective of Maxwell equations. To mitigate the inherent
ill conditioning of the inverse problem in the imaging systemarXiv:2304.11510v2  [eess.IV]  8 Mar 20242
[33], we design the EM field patterns as masks that help
translate the inverse problem into a forward problem. Next, we
utilize RIS to generate different virtual EM masks on the target
and calculate the cross-correlation between the mask patterns
and the electric field strength at the receiver. We then provide
a RIS design scheme for virtual EM masks by employing
a regularization technique. The cross-range resolution of the
proposed method is analyzed based on the spatial spectrum
of the generated masks. The proposed method translates the
original inverse problem into a forward problem and has the
advantage of simplifying the imaging process and reducing
the computation complexity. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method can achieve high-quality imaging.
Moreover, the imaging quality can be improved by generating
more virtual EM masks, by increasing the SNR at the receiver,
or by placing the target closer to the RIS.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II presents the system model and formulates the imaging
problem. Section III derives the end-to-end electromagnetic
propagation formula. Section IV elaborates the strategy of
reconstructing the image with multiple measurements. Sec-

way to generate those masks by the RIS. Section VI provides

conclusion.

II. S YSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. System Model
As shown in Fig. 1, we consider a holographic RIS-aided
computational imaging system, which consists of a single-
antenna transmitter, a holographic RIS, a 2D target, and a
single-antenna receiver. Suppose the transmitter is located in
the far field of the RIS, such that the incident waves on the
RIS becomes planar waves. Assume the receiver is located in
the far field of the target and detects the electrical intensity
of the EM waves scattered by the target. Since the detailed
patterns of the target can not be recognized in the far field
of the RIS due to the resolution limit, the target should be
placed in the near field. Meanwhile, we assume that there is
an obstacle between the transmitter and the target, which is
thick and is composed of dielectric, such that the EM waves
transmitted through the obstacle can be neglected.
Specifically, we consider the RIS as a rectangular plane
S1with length ainx-axis and length biny-axis, whose
center is located at the origin. Suppose the wave number
isk= 2π/λ where λis the wavelength. As in [34], [35],
the holographic RIS can realize a continuous reflection with
Fig. 1. The imaging system model is composed of a transmitter, a RIS, a
target, and a receiver.
coefficient function Γ(x, y) =τ(x, y)ejβ(x,y), where τ(x, y)
is the amplitude coefficient and β(x, y)is the phase shift at
the point (x, y,0)on the RIS. Denote the distance from the
target to the RIS as z′and denote (x′, y′)as the horizontal
coordinate when z=z′. Moreover, the lengths of the target in
x-axis and in y-axis are a′andb′, respectively. Normally, the
target is relatively small in size compared to RIS, i.e., a′< a
andb′< b.
The RIS is considered active, which has been introduced
in prior literature about wireless communication systems [36],
[37]. Different from passive RIS that passively reflects signals
without amplification, the key feature of active RIS is their
ability to actively reflect signals with amplification, which can
be realized by integrating reflection-type amplifiers into their
reflecting elements [38], [39]. Note that, in active RIS it is
possible that τ(x, y)>1thanks to the integrated reflection-
type amplifier. Denote the total amplification rate at RIS as PI,
which is the ratio of the power of the incident wave on the
RIS to the power of the reflected wave on the RIS. Thus, the
overall power restriction of the active RIS can be expressed
as
ZZ
S1|Γ(x, y)|2dxdy≤abPI. (1)
For 2D target reconstruction, we assume that the target is
thin, i.e., its dimension along the zdirection is much smaller
thana′andb′. The obvious restriction here is that, the target
must lie in a virtual plane more or less parallel to the RIS for
proper reconstruction [40]. Specifically, we place the target
on the virtual plane S2parallel to xyplane whose center is
located at (0,0, z′). The scattering density of the target can
be described by the function T(x′, y′), which is in the form
of a piecewise constant function. If the target covers the point
(x′, y′, z′), then T(x′, y′) = 1 ; otherwise T(x′, y′) = 0 . Since3
the target is in the near field of the RIS, then there is [41]:
z′<2(a2+b2)
λ. (2)
The upper bound of the near-field region, i.e., the right hand
side of (2) is called the Rayleigh distance for the RIS. Let dt
denote the distance between the transmitter and the center of
the RIS, and let drdenote the distance between the receiver
and the center of the target. Then the far field restriction for the
locations of the transmitter and the receiver are respectively
given by [41]:
dt>2(a2+b2)
λ, d r>2(a′2+b′2)
λ. (3)
B. Formulation for Imaging Problem
The imaging problem is equivalent to the estimation of
T(x′, y′). Since it is hard to capture T(x′, y′)on the target
all at once, we should produce multiple measurements by
altering the reflection coefficients on the RIS. In different
measurements, the reflected waves cause various EM field
patterns on the target surface to capture different target fea-
tures. Since the EM field patterns encrypt T(x′, y′), we refer
to these EM field patterns as virtual EM masks. In order to
encrypt T(x′, y′)efficiently, the virtual EM masks should be
elaborately designed. The designs of the virtual EM masks
and the corresponding RIS coefficients are conducted offline
before the measurements. In the process of the measurements,
the receiver records the electrical intensity corresponding
to different virtual EM masks. After all measurements are
completed, T(x′, y′)can be estimated at the receiver on the
basis of the correlation between virtual mask patterns and the
received electrical intensity.
III. M ODELING THE END-TO-ENDELECTROMAGNETIC
PROPAGATION
A. Scattering on the RIS
We assume the EM field configuration of the incident wave
is the transverse magnetic ex, i.e., the E-field is parallel to ex
while the H-field lies in the plane spanned by eyandez.
Since the transmitter is located in the far field, the EM waves
incident on the RIS are considered as planar waves that have
the electric and the magnetic field distributions:
Ein=E0e−jk(sin(θin)y−cos(θin)z)ex, (4)
Hin=−E0
η(cos ( θin)ey+ sin ( θin)ez)e−jk(sin(θin)y−cos(θin)z),
(5)
where η=pµ
εis the characteristic impedance of the medium,
while µandεseparately represent the magnetic permeability
and the electric permittivity.
The outgoing EM waves scattered by the RIS are defined
asEoutandHout, respectively. According to the EM reflection
theorem [42], EoutandHoutsatisfy the relations
Eout|z=0= Γ( x, y)Ein|z=0(6)
ez×Hout|z=0=−Γ(x, y)ez×Hin|z=0. (7)Since the thickness of the RIS is always negligible compared
to its length and width, we suppose that the RIS can be
replaced by an imaginary surface. Denote the transmitted fields
below the imaginary surface by EtrandHtr, respectively.
According to the physical equivalent theorem [42], Einand
Hinabove the imaginary surface can be removed. Then, an
equivalent electric current density Jeand a magnetic current
density Meshould be imposed on the imaginary surface to
satisfy the boundary conditions [42], which can be separately
expressed as
Je=ez×(Hout|z=0−Htr|z=0), (8)
Me=−ez×(Eout|z=0−Etr|z=0). (9)
Conventionally, the RIS can be assumed as a perfect elec-
trical conducting (PEC) surface [19], where Etr,Htr, andMe
become zero. Hence, only Jecontributes to the scattered fields.
Next, the physical equivalent theory is applied to remove the
PEC surface and to derive an unbounded environment [42].
The equivalent electric current density Jfis expressed as
Jf= 2Je= 2Γ( x, y)ez×Hin|z=0
= 2E0
ηcosθine−jksin(θin)yΓ(x, y)ex∆=JxΓ(x, y)ex.
(10)
We then calculate the scattered EM fields of the RIS by
first computing the magnetic vector potential, denoted as A. In
order to derive the relationship between AandJfin a concise
form, we apply Lorenz Gauge [42] throughout this paper. Then
the following expression holds true for the magnetic vector
potential Aat a near-field observation point on the target
(x′, y′, z′)[42]:
A=µ

S1Jfe−jkR
Rdxdy, (11)
where R=q
(x′−x)2+ (y′−y)2+ (z′)2is the distance
from point (x, y,0)to(x′, y′, z′). Then, Houtcan be derived
as
Hout=1

S1∇ ×e−jkR

In order to simplify the integrand in (12), we utilize the
vector identity and obtain
∇ ×e−jkR
RJf
=∇e−jkR
R

+e−jkR
R(∇ ×JxΓ(x, y)ex). (13)
Since the nabla operators take the partial derivative with
respect to x′,y′, and z′,∇ × JxΓ(x, y)exequals 0. Thus,
we can compute the three rectangular components of Houtas

(16)4
Note that, only when the target is placed in the near field
of RIS would Houtvaries significantly on different points of
the target. Thus, Houtcan be used as masks to detect the
target and then the imaging of the target can be achieved. In
order to capture possibly more information of the target, we
need to elaborately design the EM field distribution as virtual
masks, in which we need to find out a proper distribution
ofΓ(x, y)that can generate the desired EM fields. However,
calculating the distribution of Γ(x, y)with a given Hz
outor
Hy
outis an inherently ill-conditioned inverse problem, where
small perturbations in the measured field data cause large
perturbations in the recovered distributions of Γ(x, y)[33].
In general, we utilize the method of moments (MoM) [42] to
discretize the continuous function of Houtover both S1and
S2. Discretization has a regularizing effect in the sense that
the discrete formulation admits a bounded inverse though it
is highly unstable. Therefore, discrete regularization is a nec-
essary procedure in order to recover a physically meaningful
solution.
The discretization process is conducted by sampling on S1
and on S2, where the numbers of sampled points are denoted
byNandM, respectively. Define ∆xand∆yas the intervals
of the sampled points on S1inxandydirections, respectively.
Denote rn= (xn, yn,0)Tas the nth sampled point on S1and
denote r′
m= (x′
m, y′
m, z′)Tas the mth field point on S2. Since
only the tangential components of Houtwill induce electric
current on the target and since Hx
out= 0, we only focus on the
discretization of Hy
out. The formula in (16) can be simplified
to
Hy

letZ∈CM×Ncollect all Z(r′

further written as
y=Zp. (18)
Note that, yneeds to be elaborately designed for the imaging
problem. With the discrete form, the power restriction in (1)
should be expressed as
∥p∥2≤NPI. (19)
B. Scattering on a 2D Homogeneous Target
To perform the near field computational imaging, the
concrete expression of the EM waves scattered from the target
must be determined. Hence, in this subsection, we will analyze
the scattering process on a 2D homogeneous target, taking the
scattered waves from the RIS as the incident waves.
We first replace the role of the target with equivalent
electric current density J′
f. Denote the reflected magnetic field
ofHoutasHr. Then, the physical equivalent current density
on the surface of the target is
J′
f=−ez×Htotal|z=z′=−ez×(Hout|z=z′+Hr|z=z′).
(20)HereHrcan be represented as Hr=−Γ′Hout, where Γ′is the
reflection coefficient of the surface. Then J′
fcan be written as
J′
f=−(1−Γ′)ez×Hout|z=z′= (1−Γ′)Hy
out|z=z′ex
∆=J′
x(x′, y′)ex. (21)
From the fact Hx
out= 0 andHy
out̸= 0, we assert that J′
fonly
has the component in exdirection. The reflection coefficient
Γ′is determined by the surface impedance and can be assumed
as a constant across the surface of the target. Specifically, Γ′
is equal to −1for a PEC surface.
If we want to determine the scattered fields of the target,
then the vector potential Arat the receiver rr= (xr, yr, zr)
should be written as [42]
Ar=µ
4πZZ
S2T(x′, y′)J′
fe−jkR′
R′dx′dy′, (22)
where R′=q
(x′−xr)2+ (y′−yr)2+ (z′−zr)2is the
distance from point (x′, y′, z′)to(xr, yr, zr). Note that Ar
is intrinsically influenced by the target scattering density
T(x′, y′)because the equivalent current can only exist on the
area that is covered by the target. Then, Ercan be derived
as
Er=1
jk√µε∇ ×(∇ ×Ar) =1
jk√µε 
∇(∇ ·Ar)− ∇2Ar
=1
jk√µε 
∇(∇ ·Ar) +k2Ar
. (23)
The last equality in (23) holds because with the absence of
the electric current source, Arsatisfies the vector Helmholtz
equation ∇2Ar+k2Ar=0. For the last equality in
(23),∇(∇ ·Ar)only contributes variations of the order
O(1
R′2),O(1
R′3),O(1
R′4), etc, while k2Arcontains variation
of the order O(1
R′)[42]. Considering that the receiver is
located in the far field of the target, the dominant variation
is of the order1
R′and is contained in the k2Arterm. Thus,
when the receiver is located in the far field of the target, (23)
reduces to
Er≈k

where K(x′, y′)∆=k√µ
4πj√εe−jkR′
R′is the point spread function
(PSF). Substituting J′
x= 2Hy
out|z=z′into (24), we can further
compute Erwith the knowledge of Hout, which is determined
byΓ(x, y). Since Eronly consists of the x-axis component,
the scalar electric intensity at the receiver can be calculated as
|Ex

S2K(x′, y′)T(x′, y′)J′

When the incident wave on the RIS is fixed, |Ex

ofΓ(x, y)andT(x′, y′). Thus, the end-to-end electromagnetic
propagation mechanism can be determined.5

C. Scattering on a 3D Inhomogeneous Target
In this subsection, we will analyze the scattering process
on a 3D inhomogeneous dielectric target. With the equality
Eout=−jωA−j1
ωµε∇(∇ ·A)and (11), we can derive the
three rectangular components of Eoutas (26)-(28) at the top
of this page.
Assume prior knowledge has determined that the 3D target
is contained within a detection region D. For 3D target imag-
ing, it is equivalent to reconstructing the difference between
the complex relative permittivity and the complex relative
permittivity of air at each point r′in region D, denoted as
χ(r′). Since the complex relative permittivity of air is approx-
imately equal to 1, we can formulate the contrast function as
χ(r′) =ϵr(r′) +jσ(r′)/(ϵ0ω)−1, where ϵr(r′)is the real
relative permittivity at point r′,σ(r′)is the conductivity at
point r′,ϵ0is the vacuum permittivity, and ω= 2πfis the
angular frequency of EM waves. The distribution of χ(r′)is
the target that needs to be recovered in imaging problems.
For a 3D inhomogeneous dielectric target, the scattered field
at the receiver can be expressed by the following Lippmann-
Schwinger equation [43], [44]
Er(rr,r′) =k2ZZZ
DG(rr,r′)χ(r′)Etot(r′)dr′,(29)
where G(rr,r′)is the tensor electric field Green function

In (30), ˆRis the unit vector from r′torr, and the scalar Green
function is defined as g(rr,r′) =ejkR′
4πR′. The tensor G(rr,r′)
could be rewritten in a matrix form, i.e.,
G(rr,r′) =
Gxx(rr,r′)Gxy(rr,r′)Gxz(rr,r′)
Gyx(rr,r′)Gyy(rr,r′)Gyz(rr,r′)
Gzx(rr,r′)Gzy(rr,r′)Gzz(rr,r′)
.
(31)
Considering the Born approximation (BA) widely used in
imaging problems [45], we assume Etot=Eout. Suppose the
receiver can only measure the scalar electric field componentin the xdirection, which can be formulated according to (29)
and based on BA as

After discretizing B(r′, x, y)overMsampled points in Dand
Γ(x, y)overNsampled points on S1, the formula in (34) can

where the matrix Yrepresents the discretized integral kernel in
(34), while the vectors bandpcollect B(r′, x, y)andΓ(x, y)

IV. C OMPUTATIONAL IMAGING BY VIRTUAL EM M ASKS
In order to recover the image of the target, i.e., to determine
the unknown T(x′, y′), we need to exploit the relationship
between virtual EM masks and the received electric field
intensity in each measurement.
A. Imaging Method for a 2D Homogeneous Target
Denote |Ex
r|andJ′
x(x′, y′)in the ith measurement as |Ex
r,i|
andJ′
x,i(x′, y′), respectively. On the basis of the second order
correlation theory [46], the unknown T(x′, y′)can be recov-
ered by calculating the correlation between |Ex
r,i|,J′
x,i(x′, y′),
andK(x′, y′)after Itimes sampling measurements. Intu-
itively, we define the function G1(x′, y′)by summing the6

The unknown T(x′, y′)can be recovered from (36) by solving
the integral equation, which is too complicated and thus needs
to be simplified. In order to simplify the expression in (36),
we need to exchange the orders of integral, summation, and
taking the amplitude operation, which requires the phase of
the integrand being a constant in the region of integration.
Specifically, when the condition K(˜x′,˜y′)J′
x,i(˜x′,˜y′)∈R,∀i
holds true, the operation |·|can be omitted directly. To satisfy
the phase of the integrand being a constant, we should design
the RIS properly such that
∠J′
x,i=−∠K(˜x′,˜y′) =π
2+kR′,∀i. (37)
Then the integrand in (36) becomes a real number, and (36)
reduces to (38) at the top of this page.
Denote R′

tively small compared to R′

In order to calculate T(x′, y′)from (38), one needs to solve
a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, which will
bring heavy computation burden and considerable numerical
error. To circumvent this problem, we manage to decouple the
contribution of T(x′, y′)in (38). One effective approach is
to design the RIS properly, such that the weights multiplied
onT(x′, y′)become Delta function. In other words, we willdesign the current pattern J′
x,i(x′, y′)generated by the RIS to
satisfy

=c(x′, y′)δ(x′−˜x′, y′−˜y′), (41)
where c(x′, y′)is a real scalar value. Then (38) reduces to
G1(x′, y′) =c(x′, y′)|K(x′, y′)|T(x′, y′). (42)
Thus, the contributions of T(x′, y′)on different points are de-
coupled, and T(x′, y′)can be straight forwardly reconstructed
by using G1(x′, y′),c(x′, y′), and K(x′, y′). Although we
successfully find a straight forward solution to avoid solving
the first-kind Fredholm integral equation in (38), the price
is that we need to design J′
x,ithat satisfies (37) and (41)
beforehand.
By substituting the definition of G1(x′, y′)into (42), the
image of the target is reconstructed as
ˆT(x′, y′) =PI

|Ex
r,i| − ⟨|Ex

|J′
x,i(x′, y′)|
Ic(x′, y′)|K(x′, y′)|.(43)
Considering the fact that J′
x,i(x′, y′)is induced by different
distribution of Hy
out, which actually plays the role of masks
that encode the information of the target, we refer to Hy
out
asvirtual EM masks in the following context. Note that the
demanded properties of virtual EM masks, i.e., (37) and (41),
are independent from the image T(x′, y′). Thus the same set
of virtual EM masks can be repeatedly used for different
targets. After designing a fixed set of masks to satisfy (37)
and (41), we then inversely compute Γ(x, y)that can generate
the required masks on the plane of the target.
Note that those virtual masks together with the corre-
sponding Γ(x, y)are all computed offline, which does not
increase computation burden for image reconstruction. Hence,
the computation complexity in imaging process only comes
from computing T(x′, y′)onMdifferent sampled points by
(43), which is O(MI). However, the conventional methods
to solve this inverse problem with Munknowns typically
have computation complexity as high as O(M3)[47]. Since
IandMare usually of the same order of the magnitude,
the proposed reconstruction method can be accomplished with
relatively small computation overhead.
In practice, the ideal function of δ(x′−˜x′, y′−˜y′)in (41)
is impossible to be realized. The approximated Delta function
can be realized by truncating the spatial spectrum of δ(x′−
˜x′, y′−˜y′)in a finite region. Assume that the wavenumbers
inxandydirections are bounded by kx∈[−km
x, km
x]and7
ky∈
−km
y, km

, respectively (for target symmetrical with
respect to the origin). The spatial spectrum of δ(x′−˜x′, y′−˜y′)
is computed by Fourier transform (FT) as
F(kx, ky) =ZZ
S2δ(x′−˜x′, y′−˜y′)e−jkxx′−jkyy′dx′dy′
=e−jkx˜x′−jky˜y′. (44)
Then the approximation of δ(x′−˜x′, y′−˜y′)is computed by
truncating the spatial spectrum and applying inverse Fourier
transform as
˜f(x′, y′) =Zkm

(45)
where sinc [a]∆= sin( a)/a. The first zeros of the sinc functions
occur at x′−˜x′=π/km
x∆=δxandy′−˜y′=π/km
y∆=δy. Two
different points on the target have to be separated by more
thanδxandδyinxandydirections respectively, such that
their correlation function defined in (41) can be 0. Thus, δx
andδydefine the cross-range resolutions in xandydirections,
respectively.
Moreover, km
xandkm
yare determined based on the re-
flection path from RIS to the target. Denote θR
xandθR
yas
the angles subtended by the RIS along xandydirections,
respectively. Since the size of the target is relatively small
compared to the RIS, θR
xandθR
yare regarded as two constants
for any point on the target. Let us first show how to compute
km
x. The maximum phase shift between x′and˜x′occurs
when the EM waves travel from the edge of the RIS and
equals k(x′−˜x′) sin(θR
x/2)under the condition x′−˜x′≪z′.
Therefore, km
x=k(x′−˜x′) sin(θR
x/2)/(x′−˜x′) =ksin(θR
x/2)
and the cross-range resolution is
δx=π
kmx=π
ksin(θRx/2)=λ
2 sin( θRx/2). (46)
Since the center of the target is located at (0,0, z′), there is
sin(θR
x/2) =s
(a/2)2
(a/2)2+z′2=a√
a2+ 4z′2. (47)
The discussion for the resolution in the ydirection is similar.
Since the images are reconstructed using a weighted sum
of the masks, the cross-range resolution of the images is
the same as the cross-range resolution of the masks. Note
that the resolution is irrelevant to the location of the re-
ceiver. Even though the receiver is located in the far field
of the target, the resolution less than the wave length can
still be achieved, which is contrary to the common sense.
Physically speaking, the incident and the scattered waves
on the target both consist of evanescent waves and propa-
gating waves. The evanescent waves carry the high-spatial-
frequency components, while the propagating waves carry
the low-spatial-frequency components. Upon scattering on the
target, conversions take place from evanescent-wave spectrum
into propagating-wave spectrum. The high-spatial-frequency
components in the evanescent spectrum of the virtual EMmasks are encoded into propagating spectrum of the scattered
waves and thus can reach the far field. Therefore, the far-field
receiver can sense the high-spatial-frequency components of
the virtual EM masks and thus achieve resolution less than the
wave length.
Remark 1. The inspiration of reconstructing T(x′, y′)by
the cross correlation between |Ex
r,i|and|J′
x,i(x′, y′)|comes
from the ghost imaging technique in optics [46], [48]–[51].
However, there are two main differences between the proposed
approach and the ghost imaging technique. First, in the
conventional ghost imaging technique the random speckle
patterns are measured by a charge coupled device or a
scanning pinhole detector. While in the proposed approach, the
speckle patterns are calculated through rigorously derived EM
formulas. Second, the conventional ghost imaging technique
needs a changeable light source such as a digital micromirror
device (DMD) to generate pre-designed speckle patterns and
to project the speckle patterns onto the object. While in this
paper, the EM source is fixed and unchangeable, and we
propose a RIS design scheme to generate the desired masks
instead.
B. Imaging Method for a 3D Inhomogeneous Target
When imaging a 3D inhomogeneous dielectric target, both
the amplitude and the phase of Ex
rare indispensable. Denote
Ex
randB(r′)in the ith measurement as Ex
r,iandBi(r′),
respectively. Similar to the 2D imaging method, we define the
function G2(r′)as

(48)
In this case, Bi(˜r′)plays the role of the virtual masks that
should satisfy
⟨Bi(˜r′)Bi(r′)⟩I− ⟨Bi(˜r′)⟩I⟨Bi(r′)⟩I
=c(r′)δ(r′−˜r′,r′−˜r′), (49)
where c(r′)is an arbitrary scalar value. Then (48) reduces to
G2(r′) =k2c(r′)χ(r′). (50)
Thus, the image of the target is reconstructed as

V. D ESIGN AND GENERATION OF VIRTUAL EM M ASKS
The holographic active RIS can provide massive degrees
of freedom to modulate the phase, amplitude, polarization
together with multiple parameters of EM waves within sub-
wavelength resolution [28], [29], [36], [37]. Thanks to these
properties, we can generate virtual masks by properly design-
ing the holographic active RIS to satisfy the reconstruction
prerequisites, i.e., (37) and (41).8
A. Design of 2D Virtual EM Masks
For the ith measurement, let qi= [qi,1,···, qi,M]T∈RM
andgi∈RMcollect amplitude and phase of J′
x,i(x′, y′)over
Msampled points on S2, respectively. In the following, we
separately design giandqiin detail to satisfy the prerequisites
of the proposed reconstruction method, which are listed in (37)
and (41).
For different measurements, giis invariant and can be di-
rectly computed according to (37). After the sampling process,
the requirement for amplitude in (41) can be rewritten in the
discretized form as
1
IIX
i=1qi,mqi,n−1
I2IX
i=1qi,mIX
i=1qi,n=Cn,mδnm.(52)
To satisfy (52), we generate qiby using the partial columns
of the Hadamard matrix H. Each column of His utilized
to generate the mask value on a corresponding target point.
Hence, the order of the Hadamard matrix Hshould be equal to
the number of measurements I, while the number of the partial
columns should be equal to the number of the sampled points
M. Since the first column of His only composed of 1, using
the first column to generate qiwill make J′
x(x′, y′)a constant
on the first sampled point, which provides no information of
the scattering density at this point. Thus, we abandon the first
column of Hand assign the (i, m+ 1) th entry of Htoqi,m
(m= 1,···, M). According to the property of Hadamard
matrix, there are
IX
i=1qi,mqi,n=Iδnm, (53)
IX
i=1qi,m= 0. (54)
Because of (53) and (54), (52) can be satisfied with Cn,m= 1.
Moreover, because the Hadamard matrix His a square matrix
whose order can only be an integer multiple of 4,Imust be
chosen as an integer multiple of 4, too.
Since the elements of qiare amplitudes of J′
x,i(x′, y′)that
should be non-negative values, we transform the elements of qi
from−1to0. In other words, the magnetic fields are supposed
to interfere destructive at points where qi,m= 0. Apparently,
the transformation of qi,mfrom−1to0is equivalent to (1 +
qi,m)/2, which does not influence the orthogonal property of
(52) with Ci,m= 1/4after the transformation.
It is essential that the information provided by each qi
should be as different as possible, which places demands on
the prerequisite in (53). The property of (53) is defined as
theorthogonality between masks [52]. Generally speaking,
the sharper orthogonality would yield more information of
the target. Note that although we use Hadamard masks as
an example, qican also be designed using other patterns
satisfying (53), such as Gaussian random patterns and Fourier
patterns.
B. Generating 2D Virtual EM Masks by the RIS
According to (21), J′
x,i(x′, y′)is equal to (1−Γ′)Hy
out,
where (1−Γ′)is assumed to be a constant over the target
Fig. 2. Singular value spectrum of Z
composed of homogeneous material. Thus, we aim to control
the distribution of Hy
outby designing pin (18). Note that the
ignorance of the specific value of Γ′does not influence the
synthesis of EM fields.
Denote piand yiaspand yin the ith measurement,
respectively. With the knowledge of yiandZ, we can acquire
the corresponding piby solving the linear equations in (18).
The calculation of piby using conventional least squares
techniques, however, can become ill-conditioned as Nand
Mgrow relatively large. To circumvent this ill-conditioned
problem, we may reformulate the least squares problem by
applying Tikhonov regularization as
min
pi 
∥Zpi−yi∥2
2+γ∥pi∥2
2
, (55)
where γis a positive regularization parameter that decides the
weight of regularization term in (55).
In practical implementation, (55) can be solved by con-
structing another matrix, ZTik, which acts as a pseudo-inverse
operator. Denote singular value decomposition (SVD) of Zas
Z=UΣVH. The key of Tikhonov regularization is to find
the inverse of Σmodified by the regularization term in (55).
LetΛ∈CN×Mdenote the regularized pseudo-inverse of Σ
and let Σdiagdenote the diagonal components of Σ. Then the
diagonal elements of Λcan be computed as
Λdiag=Σdiag
Σ2
diag+γ. (56)
Next, the regularized pseudo-inverse of Zis computed as
ZTik=VΛUH. (57)
When we compute Σas a regularized inverse of Λ, the
singular values much larger than γdo not have any significant
modification, whereas the singular values much smaller than
γmake negligible contribution to the solution of ZTik. Thus,
Λdiagcan be set directly as 0when Σdiagdrops to a certain
threshold that is much less than γ, e.g., 10−5γ. When the
relatively small Λdiagare removed, we only need to utilize
the major current patterns on the RIS to generate the desired
EM masks. Therefore, the rank of ZTikis reduced, and the
computational efficiency is improved.9

 (b) the amplitude of reflecting coefficients on the RIS
Fig. 3. Phase and amplitude of the coefficients on the RIS when generating one of the virtual masks, where we choose N= 16384 ,PI= 1.
To provide a visual example of the distribution of singular
values, we show the values of the 200largest Σdiagin Fig. 2
when M= 4096 andN= 16384 . It is seen that Σdiagdecays
rapidly in a staircase curve with the growth of singular value
index. The sharp decay of the singular values leads to an
enormous condition number of Z, which makes it necessary
to apply Tikhonov regularization. The well-coupled modes for
RIS and target planes correspond to those large singular values,
whose number is small compared to MandN. When z′
becomes larger, Σdiag decays more sharply, and the number
of dominant singular values is smaller.
After computing ZTikby (57), pican be obtained directly
according to the Moore-Penrose solution as
˜pi=ZTikyi. (58)
Considering the total amplification rate PIat RIS, the imple-
mented reflection coefficient should be normalized as
pi=p
NPI˜pi
∥˜pi∥. (59)
In order to provide a visual example of the 2D virtual EM
mask generated by RIS, we show the phase and the amplitude
of the RIS in Fig. 3 and compare the ideal mask with the
generated mask in Fig. 4. The system parameters are set as
PI= 1,xr= 15 m,yr= 25 m,zr=−30m,N= 16384 ,
M= 4096 ,λ= 0.01m,a=b= 1 m, and a′=b′= 0.5m.
The Tikhonov regularization parameter is set as γ= 10−12
andγ= 10−15forz′= 2m and z′= 8m, respectively. It is
seen from Fig. 3 that both the phase and the amplitude of the
RIS vary sharply in order to generate a complicated pattern
of the virtual mask. The points with |Γ(x, y)|<1represent
that there is power flow from the incident EM waves into the
RIS, while the points with |Γ(x, y)|>1represent that there
is power flow from the RIS to the reflected EM waves.
It is seen from Fig. 4 that, there are differences between
the ideal mask and the generated mask, while such differences
become more significant with the increase of z′because the
EM fields are harder to manipulate in the farther zone. As
shown in Fig. 4(a)-Fig. 4(c), the phases of the ideal virtual
mask change almost linearly with respect to x′andy′, which
verifies the approximation made in (39). Although the phasesof the generate virtual masks have some local differences
compared with Fig. 4(a), the linear variation trend can still
be observed in both Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c). Despite the
amplitude discrepancy, the patterns in Fig. 4(e) are almost
the same as those in Fig. 4(d) but have the difference that
the image contrast in Fig. 4(e) is less than the sharp 0-1
contrast in the ideal Hadamard mask. The lower contrast leads
to a smaller Cm,nin (52), while it does not severely weaken
the orthogonality among the virtual masks. When z′= 8 m,
even the patterns in Fig. 4(f) are also distorted. The mismatch
between the ideal mask and the generated mask will degrade
the orthogonality among masks, thereby reducing the imaging
quality.
Since the errors are caused by the finite-sized RIS and
finite sampled points on the holograghic RIS, the quality of
generated field can be improved by increasing the overall size
of RIS, which however, is limited by the manufacturing capa-
bility. A more practical approach to enhance the orthogonality
among the masks is to decrease z′.
In order to show the orthogonality property among the
generated masks, we calculate the correlation function with
respect to the central point of the target according to the left-
hand side of (52) in Fig. 5, with the same set of parameters
in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. It is seen from Fig. 5 that the correlation
function is not a strict Delta function due to the imperfect
generated masks. However, the correlation function is still
close to 0except for a small region around the central point.
Forz′= 2 m, the non-zero regions are more concentrated
than those for z′= 8 m, and the correlation function is more
similar to Delta function. This is because when z′is smaller,
θR
xandθR
ywill be larger, leading to a smaller cross-range
resolution δxandδyaccording to (46).
C. Design and Generation of 3D Virtual EM Masks
Define bias the 3D virtual EM mask vector bin (35) from
theith measurement. Similar to the design of qiin (52)-(54),
biis generated by using Mcolumns of the Hadamard matrix
H∈RI×I. Each column of His utilized to generate the mask
values on a corresponding sampled point such that (51) can10

VI. S IMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
Since the holographic RIS is still a type of hardware
under study and several key challenges in manufacturing
process remain to be solved [53], we are temporarily unable to
conduct experimental measurements. Instead, we use the 3D
EM simulation software Ansys HFSS to simulate the imaging
process and to generate the received signals, which are used
in reconstructing the image of the object. In the simulations,
we consider a square RIS of size a=b= 2 m. The total
amplification rate at RIS is set as PI= 1. The elevation
angle of the incident EM waves on the RIS is θin= 30◦. The
wavelength is λ= 0.01m, i.e., the frequency is 29.9GHz.
The size of the target is a′=b′= 0.5m, and the distance
between the target and the RIS is adjusted in the region z′∈
[2,8]m. Correspondingly, there is sin(θR
x/2),sin(θR
y/2)∈
[0.7071,0.2425] and the cross-range resolution is computed
from (46) as δx, δy∈[0.0071,0.0206] m. We set the location
of the receiver as (xr, yr, zr) = (40 ,40,−10) m, which
guarantees that the line-of-sight path of waves reflected from
the target to the receiver will not be blocked by the RIS, andthe receiver is located within the far field of the target, i.e.,
dr>2(a′2+b′2)
λ= 50 m.
The source of noise in the simulation is thermal noise on
the receiver load. We consider a system that uses a bandwidth
B= 1 MHz , while the power spectral density of the thermal
noise is N0=−174 dBm /Hz. Consequently, the thermal
noise power is σ2
n=N0B=−114 dBm and the SNR at the
receiver is defined as SNR =Pr/σ2
n. Let the vector t∈CM
collect T(x′, y′)orχ(r′)on the Msampled points for the 2D
or the 3D target respectively. We then introduce the normalized
mean square error (NMSE) as the criterion to quantitatively
describe the quality of imaging performance:
NMSE =t−ˆt2

A. Imaging Performance for a 2D Homogeneous Target
The material of the 2D target is set as PEC, i.e., Γ′=−1.
We choose the number of sampled points as N= 128 ×
128 = 16384 andM= 64×64 = 4096 , respectively. The
Tikhonov regularization parameter is set as γ= 10−12,10−14,
and10−15forz′∈[2,3],(3,5], and (5,8]m, respectively.
Each sampled point on the target can be regarded as a pixel
in the image, i.e., the picture is composed of M= 64×11

64 = 4096 pixels. The interval of the adjacent pixels is thus
a′/64 = b′/64 = 0 .0078 m, which is of the same order of
magnitude as δxandδy. More pixels could hardly improve
the imaging quality due to the resolution limit.
1) Imaging Performance versus the Number of Measure-
ments
We explore the NMSE versus the number of measurements
I, as shown in Fig. 7. We set SNR at the receiver as 20dB
and the distance of the target as z′= 2,4,and8m. The target
“SEU” shown in Fig. 6(a) is used in test. The generations
of Hadamard matrices for different Iare accomplished by
Sylvester’s construction, Paley construction, or the Turynconstruction.
To illustrate the imaging result vividly, we present the
reconstructed images of two target patterns when z′= 4 m
and SNR = 20 dB. The first target, “SEU”, is the abbreviation
for Southeast University, and the second target is the school
badge of Tsinghua University. The first target pattern is simple,
with more low-frequency components, while the second target
pattern is complex, with more high-frequency components.
As shown in Fig. 6, all reconstructed images reproduce the
general shapes of the targets accurately. If Iis equal to the
total number of pixels, i.e., I= 4096 , then the restored
image will have obvious speckles, making the images blurry.12
Fig. 7. NMSE versus the number of measurements I, with SNR = 20 dB
However, when Iis4times more than the total number of
pixels, i.e., I= 16384 , the imaging result is clear, with only
the background not matching the original target. It is then
evident that the reconstruction algorithm works well for a large
number of measurements that compensate for the distortion of
the generated masks.
It is seen from Fig. 7 that, as Iincreases, the NMSE
will decrease, indicating that a larger number of measurements
improves the quality of the imaging system. When Iis small,
the measurements are sparse, and there is insufficient infor-
mation to accurately reconstruct the object. As Iincreases,
more information of the target will be captured, and the
reconstructed image becomes more accurate. Additionally,
when the distance between the target and the RIS is reduced
to2m, the NMSE becomes smaller than that at the distances
of4m and 8m, indicating that the imaging performance is
superior for targets in closer proximity to the RIS.
2) Imaging Performance versus SNR
To illustrate the imaging result vividly, we present the
reconstructed images of two target patterns when z′= 4 m
andI= 16384 . As shown in Fig. 8, when SNR = 10 dB,
the high-spatial-frequency speckles caused by noise cover the
reconstructed image, making the target almost unrecognizable.
When SNR = 30 dB, the reconstructed images are generally
in good agreements with the targets. The only difference is
the slight discrepancy between the background of the image
and that of the original target.
The NMSE versus SNR with different z′is shown in
Fig. 9, where I= 4096 is selected, and the target “SEU”
is used in test. It is seen that, the NMSE decreases with
the increase of SNR for all z′, and the best performance is
achieved when z′= 2 m. When SNR is smaller than 5dB,
the NMSE is large and decreases slowly with the increase
of SNR. In this stage, the differences among the NMSE for
different z′are not pronounced. The NMSE decreases rapidly
when SNR increases from 5dB to 20dB. When SNR reaches
the threshold of 20dB, the NMSE decreases to the error
floor and no longer changes. At this point, the restriction of
imaging quality is no longer the noise at the receiver, but is
the lack of the orthogonality among the masks used for each
measurement. As the target gets farther away from the RIS,the discrepancy between the practical EM field distribution
patterns and the ideal Hadamard masks becomes greater. Thus,
the orthogonality among the actual generated virtual masks
becomes weaker, leading to a larger error floor in imaging.
Moreover, an error floor is reached at lower SNR levels.
B. Imaging Performance for a 3D Inhomogeneous Target
The imaging domain Dis chosen as a cubic box whose
length is 0.5m in each dimension. We choose the number of
sampled points on RIS as N= 128 ×128 = 16384 and the
number of sampled points in DasM= 32×32×8 = 8192 ,
where there are 8discrete slices along the zaxis. The
Tikhonov regularization parameter is set as γ= 10−14. In
order to compare with the images of the 2D scenario, the 3D
target is columnar “SEU” made of inhomogeneous materials
as shown in Fig. 10(a) and Fig. 10(d). Both the relative
permittivity and conductivity of the target increase with the
increase of z′and change linearly along the xandydirections.
We present the reconstructed images through the relative
permittivity and conductivity on three cross section planes
with z′∈[2,2.5]m and I= 32768 . As shown in Fig. 10,
the reconstructed images reflect the approximate shape of the
target on each cross section plane. When SNR = 10 dB,
the edges of the images are blurry and the reconstructed
values of relative permittivity and conductivity have a large
deviation. There are points not in line with physical reality, i.e.,
with relative permittivity less than 1 or negative conductivity.
Besides, the differences among the images on the three planes
are not clearly reflected. When SNR = 30 dB, the edges are
sharper and the reconstructed images are generally in good
agreements with the targets. Moreover, the changes of relative
permittivity and conductivity along zaxis are resolved in the
reconstructed images. In general, compared to the images of
the 2D homogeneous target, the images are more blurry and
the contrast of images is less significant due to the inaccuracy
of BA.
The NMSE versus SNR is shown in Fig. 11 with I=
32768 . It is seen that, the NMSE decreases with the increase
of SNR, and the best performance is achieved when z′∈
[2,2.5]m. When SNR is smaller than 10dB, the NMSE is
large and decreases slowly with the increase of SNR. In this
stage, the differences among the NMSE for different z′are
not pronounced. When SNR reaches a threshold, the NMSE
decreases to an error floor. The error floor mainly comes from
the mismatch between BA and the real scattering process as
well as the lack of orthogonality among the actual generated
virtual masks. Since the 3D image is composed of more
sampled points compared to the 2D image, the number of the
measurements is larger correspondingly. However, the NMSE
of the 3D target is still generally larger than that of the 2D
homogeneous target due to the disparity between BA and the
real scattering process of the 3D inhomogeneous target.
VII. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a novel imaging scheme that
employs holographic active RIS to create virtual EM masks
on the target. This method simplifies the process and reduces13

the computation costs compared to the conventional methods.
To implement the approach, the RIS generates various virtual
EM masks on the target, and the cross-correlation between
the mask patterns and the electric field strength at the receiver
is then calculated to extract information from the target and
produce high-quality images. We then propose a RIS design
criterion for generating the proposed virtual EM masks. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is
effective and robust for both 2D and 3D targets. Moreover, the
quality of the images could be further enhanced by properly
adjusting SNR, the number of generated masks, as well as the
distance between the target and the RIS.REFERENCES
