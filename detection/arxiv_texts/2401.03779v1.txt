ABSTRACT
Context. Recent observations of protostellar cores suggest that most of the material in the protostellar phase is accreted along stream-
ers. Streamers in this context are defined as velocity coherent funnels of denser material potentially connecting the large scale envi-
ronment to the small scales of the forming accretion disk.
Aims. Using simulations which simultaneously resolve the driving of turbulence on the filament scale as well as the collapse of the
core down to protostellar disk scales, we aim to understand the e ffect of the turbulent velocity field on the formation of overdensities
in the accretion flow.
Methods. We perform a three-dimensional numerical study on a core collapse within a turbulent filament using the RAMSES code
and analyse the properties of overdensities in the accretion flow.
Results. We find that overdensities are formed naturally by the initial turbulent velocity field inherited from the filament and subse-
quent gravitational collimation. This leads to streams which are not really filamentary but show a sheet-like morphology. Moreover,
they have the same radial infall velocities as the low density material. As a main consequence of the turbulent initial condition, the
mass accretion onto the disk does not follow the predictions for solid body rotation. Instead, most of the mass is funneled by the
overdensities to intermediate disk radii.

1. Introduction
While the classical picture of star formation assumes the gravi-
tational collapse of an isolated spherical stellar core similar to a
Bonnor-Ebert or singular isothermal sphere (Larson 1969; Pen-
ston 1969; Shu 1977; Foster & Chevalier 1993), it is now well
supported that most star forming cores lie within filaments of
molecular clouds (André et al. 2014). Consequently, stars do not
form in isolation but can accrete actively from their environment.
This picture also has been established by observations with the
emergence of streamers, velocity coherent non-isotropic accre-
tion structures, which have been detected during all stages in the
evolution of young stellar objects (Pineda et al. 2023).
During the disk build-up in embedded protostellar class-0 /I
objects, non-isotropic accretion streams have been observed in
dust (Le Gouellec et al. 2019) and molecular emission (Cabedo
et al. 2021; Murillo et al. 2022; Valdivia-Mena et al. 2022; Kido
et al. 2023). Typically, the measured sizes are around a few
thousand AU with accretion rates of around 1 .0×10−6M⊙yr−1.
However, there have been cases of streamers extending up to
10000 AU (Pineda et al. 2020) and accretion rates exceeding
1.0×10−5M⊙yr−1(Valdivia-Mena et al. 2023). Most observa-
tions show an one major accretion stream onto a single core.
Nonetheless, there have been detections of more complex struc-
tures such as multiple streamers (Thieme et al. 2022) and stream-
ers accreting onto binary system (Hsieh et al. 2023).
Non-isotropic infall has a major impact on the forming pro-
toplanetary disk, potentially leading to various substructures and
instabilities (Bae et al. 2015; Lesur et al. 2015; Ku ffmeier et al.
2021; Kuznetsova et al. 2022). This raises the fundamental ques-tion if planet formation already begins during the build-up of the
disk in the class-0 phase in contrast to an isolated unperturbed
disk in the class-II phase which is often assumed (Testi et al.
2014; Lesur et al. 2022). Not only was it shown by Dr˛ a˙ zkowska
& Dullemond (2018) that planetesimals may form during infall,
but there is even growing observational evidence that planet for-
mation may start at an earlier stage. Submillimeter observations
of disks in the class-II phase show insu fficient dust masses to ex-
plain the formation of exoplanetary systems (Najita & Kenyon
2014; Ansdell et al. 2017; Manara et al. 2018) in contrast to dust
masses of disks in the class-0 /I phase (Greaves & Rice 2011;
Tychoniec et al. 2018; Tobin et al. 2020; Tychoniec et al. 2020).
Additionally, there are indications of dust growth in the early
phases of disk formation (Kwon et al. 2009; Harsono et al. 2018;
Hsieh et al. 2019; Segura-Cox et al. 2020). Finally, the isotopic
distribution in meteorites (Kruijer et al. 2014; Van Kooten et al.
2016; Kruijer et al. 2017) and lack of water in the inner Solar
System (Morbidelli et al. 2016) suggest the early formation of a
dynamical barrier such as Jupiter.
Several numerical studies have also shown that the large
scales play an essential role for the distribution of mass accre-
tion onto the disk. Models of collapsing cores including turbu-
lence and magnetic fields usually lead to the formation of ac-
cretion channels onto the disk (Walch et al. 2010; Joos et al.
2013; Seifried et al. 2013, 2015; Matsumoto et al. 2017; Lam
et al. 2019; Hennebelle et al. 2020). These can have a major
impact on the accretion source function which specifies where
accreted material enters the disk. For example, Lee et al. (2021)
detected larger accretion rates towards the centre than expected
from angular momentum conservation of solid body rotation.

Fig. 1: Projection of the core at 93 .2 kyr before its collapse and sink particle creation. The left hand side shows the projection of the
whole box with a size of 0 .4 pc. The right hand side shows a zoom onto the core with a radius of 7500 AU. One can see that the core
shows substructure as it inherits turbulent motions from the large scale filament.
Some studies were also able to self-consistently resolve the dy-
namical range from molecular clouds down to the disk using
either adaptive mesh refinement (Ku ffmeier et al. 2017, 2018,
2019; Lebreuilly et al. 2021; Pelkonen et al. 2021; Ku ffmeier
et al. 2023) or SPH methods (Bate 2018). Despite the di fferent
set-ups and physics used, all of the simulations stress that the
inhomogeneous accretion via streamers is highly dependent on
the environment and leads to instabilities, disk misalignment and
even late replenishment of the disk (Ku ffmeier et al. 2023).
While star formation can take place in molecular clouds in
various di fferent environments, the purpose of this paper is to
explore the case of a collapsing core within a turbulent fila-
ment. The turbulent environment of the core is generated self-
consistently by gas accretion onto the filament. As we do not
resolve the full physics needed to explore the disk evolution, we
concentrate on the analysis of the accretion onto the disk itself.
The paper is organised as follows: first we present the numeri-
cal simulation and initial condition in section 2. Thereafter, we
present the results in section 3 and its various subsections. We
compare our simulation to other numerical studies in section 4
and conclude in section 5.
2. Numerical set-up
The simulation was run with the code ramses by Teyssier
(2002) using the MUSCL scheme (Monotonic Upstream-
Centred Scheme for Conservation Laws, van Leer 1977), a
second-order Godunov scheme for solving the discretised Euler
equations in conservative form on a Cartesian grid. As Riemann
solver we used the HLLC-Solver (Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact,
Toro et al. 1994) together with the multidimensional MC slope
limiter (monotonized central-di fference, van Leer 1979).
We set up a forming filament in a radially converging flow as
defined in Heigl et al. (2020) as an large-scale initial condition.
The simulation consists of an isothermal 3D box of size 0 .1 pc
with periodic boundary conditions in the filament direction, in
this case the x-axis. The isothermal temperature is set to 10 .0 K
and a molecular weight of µ=2.36 which results in a sound
speed of around 0 .19 km s−1. We define a cylindrical inflow in
a cylindrical shell at the edge of the box onto the central x-axis
with a fixed density and radial velocity which are constantly re-
set at every time-step. In order to break the symmetry the densityin the inflow region is varied on a cell-by-cell basis with a ran-
dom value which varies around the mean with a maximum of
50%. The inflow density and the density inside the domain is set
to 3.92×10−22g cm−3which corresponds to a particle density of
about 1.0×102cm−3and the inflow velocity is set to Mach 6.0
for the isothermal gas which equals a velocity of 1 .13 km s−1.
The mass accretion rate per length onto the filament therefore
corresponds to ˙M/L=8.4 M⊙pc−1Myr−1. This flow not only
acts as an external pressure to confine the filament material but
also drives turbulence inside the filament which quickly settles
to a constant level. As shown in Heigl et al. (2018), the turbu-
lence velocity is around 0 .23 km s−1, or Mach 1.18, for an inflow
velocity of Mach 6.0. This value is independent of the accretion
flow density itself as well as the strength of its random variation
as kinetic energy is converted to turbulent energy. However, the
turbulent velocity does show an anti-correlation to the density
profile with the centre of the filament showing lower values than
the surface.
The minimum resolution of the simulation is 2563cells
which is equivalent to 1 .56×10−3pc or about 323 AU. How-
ever, we heavily make use of adaptive mesh refinement in or-
der to resolve the scales down to the creation of an accretion
disk with a maximum resolution of 163833cells corresponding
to 2.44×10−5pc or 5.04 AU. In order to minimise dissipation
across refinement levels and to resolve thin streamer structures
in a large region around the forming disk, we employ an ag-
gressive refinement criterion where the Truelove criterion for the
maximum density has to be fulfilled by a factor of 128 (Truelove
et al. 1997).
As soon as the maximum refinement level reaches a density
of 1.83×10−13g cm−3where the Jean’s length is not resolved
by at least four cells, a sink particle is placed in the centre if the
region fulfills several conditions. In the standard version of ram-
sesthese conditions consist mainly of the gravitational potential
dominating over the thermal and kinetic support. We also allow
mass accretion onto the sinks by using the implemented Bondi
accretion algorithm with the standard setting of the accretion ra-
dius of four cells. The amount and distribution of sink particles
strongly depend on the formation conditions and the subsequent
accretion. However, as this paper’s main focus is the creation of
streamers and as we do not include enough physics to properly
describe the processes inside of the disk, we will explore the sink
population in a future paper. In this study, the main purpose of

the simulation running. Doing so, their impact on the streamers
are minimal.

3.1. Core collapse and disk formation
Over time a turbulent filament forms inside the box constrained
by the accretion pressure of the radial flow. As soon as the fila-
ment’s line-mass reaches close to critical values given by

with csbeing the isothermal sound speed and Gbeing the grav-
itational constant, a core begins to form as shown in Figure 1.
We do not impose any overdensity in the initial condition or the
accretion flow and the location where the core forms is only de-
termined by the initial seed for the random number generator.
The core itself shows turbulent motions and substructure. Before
its collapse, the core’s density profile closely follows a Bonnor-
Ebert distribution as shown in the upper panel of Figure 2. The
measured mean density in each radial bin is given by the solid
line together with its standard deviation shown as the gray area.
We compare it to the isothermal Bonnor-Ebert profile shown as

This velocity is shown as solid line in the bottom panel of Fig-
ure 2. One can see that the turbulent velocity is relatively con-
stant throughout the Bonnor-Ebert sphere at a value with a mean
of 0.096 km s−1which we use for our turbulent Bonnor-Ebert
profile in the upper panel given by the dotted line. The actual
density seems to match the turbulent profile better, the error bars
however are too large to distinguish between the isothermal and
turbulent profile.
We also check if there is an overall rotation of the core which
provides the angular momentum for the formation of a disk and
which can potentially influence the formation of streamers. For
a core with solid body rotation there are analytic models which
predict the accretion rate onto the disk as a function of time and

radius (Ulrich 1976; Hueso & Guillot 2005). Therefore, we also
plot the total specific angular momentum in the upper panel of
Figure 3. We calculate the total specific angular momentum as
jtot=Pρv×rPρ, (3)
where we use the density ρ, the velocity vand the radial position
rof each cell. We determine the total specific angular momen-
tum of each radial shell individually, shown as the solid line, as
well as cumulatively for all cells within a given radius, shown
by the dashed line. As the total angular momentum is non-zero,
there is some bulk rotation which, however, is very small com-
pared to overall turbulent motion.
Both curves, the one calculated per radius and the cumulative
one, seem to scale close to linearly with the radius as indicated
by the fit to the former value given by the dotted line with a
slope of 1.10±0.02. This is due to the fact that the bulk veloc-
ity is relatively constant with radius, similar to the turbulent ve-
locity. Observations of the cumulative total angular momentum
rather suggest a scaling with radius to the power of 1.5 (Good-
man et al. 1993; Caselli et al. 2002; Pirogov et al. 2003; Chen

et al. 2007; Tobin et al. 2011; Yen et al. 2015). This scaling was
proposed by Burkert & Bodenheimer (2000) as a consequence
of sampling the turbulent velocity field at di fferent scales and we
also show it in the plot as dashed-dotted line. One can see, that it
does not seem to match the total profiles as good as the linear fit.
However, if we limit the fitted area to typical scales used in ob-
servations of above 1000 AU, the slope is slightly steeper with a
slope of 1.21±0.02 which matches both scalings similarly well.
While there seems to be some bulk rotation, the core shows
no signs of solid body rotation which would suggest the total an-
gular momentum to be proportional to the radius squared. More-
over, the bulk motion is not necessarily rotating in the same di-
rection throughout the core as shown by the lower panel. Here,
we plot the direction of the angular momentum vector for each
radial shell. As one can see the azimuthal and polar angle are
constantly changing throughout the core which proves that there
is no ordered overall rotation.
After a short time, the core begins to collapse and a sink par-
ticle forms in its centre. Over time, more and more material falls
onto the sink particle and, as not all of it is accreted directly, a
disk forms around it. This situation is shown in Figure 4 which
shows a face and edge-on projection of the density within a box
of 4000 AU centred around the central sink particle. The sink
has reached a mass of 0 .68 M⊙and the disk a mass of 0 .09 M⊙
at 24.32 kyr after the sink formation. Depending on the column
density contrast, one can clearly make out denser streams of ma-
terial of lengths of up to several thousand AU flowing onto the
disk. They do not necessarily settle to the disk plane before hit-
ting the disk, but also seem to be accreted within the disk. For the
further analysis of the streamer properties, we will concentrate
on this snapshot.
In order to investigate the geometry of the streamers, we cut
a spherical shell out of the three-dimensional density distribution
at a radius of 400 AU from the central sink particle and project it
on a map using a Hammer projection as shown in Figure 5. One
can see, that most of the area is filled by low density material of
around 1.0×10−18g cm−3and that the denser material of more
than 1.0×10−16g cm−3forms concentrated, distinct structures. If
the streamers would be filamentary by nature, they would appear
as point-like density enhancements where they cross the shell.
However, most of the higher density structures show a large ex-

tent in one direction which is typical of sheet-like structures.
This also becomes apparent when looking at the density projec-
tion around the disk in di fferent angles which show vastly dif-
ferent configurations of density enhancements which is caused
by the projection of sheets along the line-of-sight. The sheet-like
geometry of the overdensities was already noted in Ku ffmeier
et al. (2017) and is consistent to large radii, however the den-
sity contrast also becomes weaker which can be seen below in
Figure 12 where we show the density maps for larger distances.
We also note, that the Hammer projections are created from an
interpolation on a grid of regular angle spacing. However, the
statistical analysis shown in the next sections is performed on a
Healpix map (Gorski et al. 1999) which uses an equal-area and
iso-latitude pixelisation in order to circumvent an oversampling
of high latitudes.
3.2. Infall velocities and accretion
In order to measure the infall, we calculate the mean density and
mean radial velocity at every radius which we show in Figure 6
as the solid blue and red line together with the standard deviation
of the radial velocity shown as the shaded red area. The standard
deviation of the density is quite large, especially for small radii
as the density varies over three orders of magnitude. Therefore,
we do not show it in order to keep the plot legible. We compare
the resulting profiles to the expected density and velocity of free-
fall collapse given by the dashed blue and red line, respectively.
The free-fall velocity is given by
vff=r
2G(M∗+Mdisk)
r, (4)
with M∗andMdiskbeing the mass of the central sink particle
and the disk and rbeing the radius. The free-fall density is then
calculated assuming that the mass accretion rate
˙M=4πr2ρvff (5)
is constant, at least for small radii, as there is no mass build-up
in a radial shell. We also observe that the mass accretion rate is
roughly constant at around 2 .6×10−5M⊙yr−1which we use to

One can see that both, the density and velocity, follow closely
the free-fall model. For small radii below 280 AU, the density
shows a strong increase which is the accretion shock onto the
outer radius of the disk where the infall velocity also reaches a
maximum. For larger radii above 3000 AU, we see that the free-
fall model is not a good description of the infall anymore which
is where pressure e ffects start to play a larger role and where we
have a transition to the filament material.
An interesting aspect of the collapse is whether the density
enhancements have a di fferent radial and angular velocity com-
pared to the low density regions. As material is concentrated into
denser structures, its angular momentum could add up and force
it onto more non-radial dominated orbits or the angular momen-
tum could cancel out, forcing it onto more radial orbits. How-
ever, there does not seem to be a strong trend which we show
in Figure 7. At a distance of 400 AU, we calculate the mean ra-
dial and absolute angular velocity within sixteen di fferent log-
arithmic density bins, given by the solid red and orange line,
respectively. In addition, we also calculate the median value as
the distribution of the velocity within each density bin is not nec-
essary Gaussian. As one can see the radial velocity is relatively
independent of the density, despite it spanning three orders of
magnitude. Overall, it is slightly lower but very close to the free-
fall velocity given by the dashed red line of about 1 .8 km s−1.
The o ffset could be due to the reason that the disk at this dis-
tance cannot be approximated as a point-like gravitational source
which should lead to a slightly lower free-fall velocity at small
radii. There is a small decrease of the mean radial velocity in the
very low density bin and a very shallow trend to lower velocities
at the very high density bins. The reason for this at very low den-
sities could be that the material can be more easily diverted onto
non-radial orbits due to the gravitational attraction of the denser

gas. We investigate this by looking at the mean absolute non-
radial velocity component given in each density bin by the or-
ange solid line in Figure 7 with a standard deviation depicted by
the orange shaded area. The non-radial motions are much slower
than the radial collapse with values of around 0 .75 km s−1. And
indeed, the lowest density bin shows a slight increase in non-
radial motions indicating that there is a process forcing material
onto non-radial orbits. We also see a general trend to slower ve-
locities for larger densities which could be caused by the colli-
mation of material into sheets where there is some canceling of
angular momentum.
A consequence of a relatively uniform infall velocity is that
the mass accretion rate scales with the density. This means
that most of the mass which lands in the disk is accreted via
the denser structures. We visualise this fact in Figure 8 where
we plot the surface fraction in dark blue and the mass accre-
tion rate in light blue in the same density bins as in Figure 7.
While most cells show a low density, with the maximum being
at around 6 .0×10−18g cm−3, it is the high density cells above
2.0×10−17g cm−3where most mass is accreted. Focussing only
on the very dense structure above 1 .0×10−16g cm−3shows that
close to half of the total mass accretion rate through the shell,
namely 1.24×10−5M⊙Myr−1of 2.58×10−5M⊙Myr−1, is ac-
creted in only a fraction of 0.1 of the total surface. Therefore,
the dense accretion structures play an essential role in bringing
in material to small scales. Moreover, given that Figure 7 shows
that the angular velocity and thus the specific angular momentum
is relatively constant in each density bin. Therefore, the accre-
tion of absolute angular momentum shows the same distribution
as the mass accretion rate.
Additionally, it is vital to understand where the material en-
ters the disk as not all material is accreted at the outer radius.
We measure the mass accretion rate onto the disk at each radius
by azimuthally summing up the flux through the surfaces located
10 cells above and below the central plane using the velocity per-
pendicular to the disk. We show the resulting total mass accretion
rate in Figure 9 as the black solid line together with its side of
origin, either the top or bottom face, as red and teal dashed lines.

with a steep drop towards smaller and larger radii up to the max-
imum extent of the disk of about 280 AU. The integral over all
radii equals the total mass accretion rate of 2 .58×10−5M⊙Myr−1
which we already measured on larger scales. While this only rep-
resents one measurement for this particular point in time, we do
observe this pattern of accretion onto intermediate radii to be rel-
atively stable over timescales of several ten thousand years when
normalising for the disk size.
The accretion itself is highly asymmetrical which can be seen
in the separate accretion rates for the di fferent sides of the disk.
While it is dominated at large radii by accretion coming from be-
low the disk, the accretion at lower radii is mainly coming from
above. This can also be observed in the projection plots of Fig-
ure 4 and implies that the angular momentum is not distributed
isotropically. Looking at the split-up between low and high den-
sity, one can also see that the bulk of the mass accretion consists
of high density material. This could already be seen from Fig-
ure 8, but shows that the density enhancements continue down
onto the disk itself. Interestingly, the low density regime does
not display the same strong tendency for a preferred accretion
radius but shows a more distributed, albeit negligible, accretion
with a similar rate at all radii.
We also include predictions from two di fferent models for the
mass accretion rate of a core under solid body rotation. Although
we already showed that the initial core does not rotate as a solid
body, this is the only model for which an analytic description of
the mass accretion rate exist. The dashed-dotted line shows the
model by Ulrich (1976) which assumes that every mass element
of a radial shell hits the disk under a parabolic orbit according
to its angular momentum with the central sink being in its focus.
This leads to the so-called source function, the mass accretion

The dotted line uses the model by Hueso & Guillot (2005) which

In principle, the mass accretion rate and the centrifugal radius
both depend on time. However, in the case of free-fall, the mass
accretion rate is constant and the evolution of centrifugal radius
can be described analytically. In our case, where we do not start
with solid body rotation, we cannot calculate the centrifugal ra-
dius as function of time. Therefore, we use the radial extent of
the disk of 280 AU as an estimate for the models. As expected,
the measured mass accretion rate deviates strongly from the solid
body rotation case which predicts larger accretion rates towards
the centre and close to the centrifugal radius. The deficit of ma-
terial coming in at small radii is a consequence of the accreted
material lacking very low angular momentum. For solid body ro-
tation this is the material close to the rotational axis. However,
due to the turbulent initial condition, there is no ordered rotation
and therefore not much gas with very low angular momentum.
The same argument is valid inversely for the mass accretion rate
at very large radii. For solid body rotation this is given by the
material in the plane of rotation. However, in our case, the max-
imum angular momentum is limited by the random motion of
the gas which is statistically more unlikely to reach large values
consistently.

velocity divergence [km s1 AU1]
Fig. 11: Hammer projection of the velocity divergence of the
non-radial velocity components at 400 AU distance from the
central sink particle. Areas in red show structures where material
is compressed due to the velocity field.
As the core is collapsing essentially in free-fall and each shell
is accreted consecutively with larger and larger angular momen-
tum, the mean main accretion radius should be set by the to-
tal angular momentum of the shell where the gas originated. As
not all mass of the shell is combined into one accretion stream,
there should be some spread in angular momentum of the indi-
vidual overdensities. However, this spread should be around the
total angular momentum of the original shell. We can test this
by determining the original radius in two di fferent ways. On the
one hand, we can compare the angular momentum of the current
mean main accretion to the initial angular momentum distribu-
tion. One the other hand, we can calculate the distance the cur-
rent main accretion travelled under the assumption of free-fall
collapse.
To estimate the total angular momentum we use the mass ac-
cretion peak at 80 AU and the angular velocity of the dense gas of
around 0.6 kms−1to get a rough value of 7 .0×1019cm2s−1. Com-
paring this value to Figure 3 this means that the material is com-
ing from a shell of roughly two to three thousand AU. The dis-
tance the gas would travel due to the free-fall time in about 25 kyr
also equals around two thousand AU. This means that here the
main accretion radius indeed seems to be set by the shell’s angu-
lar momentum. If the angular momentum of accretion streams is
always distributed around the shells original total angular mo-
mentum, the mean main accretion radius should expand over
time as its value is increasing with further distance. However,
because the angular momentum of each individual shell is not
always aligned to the other shells, accretion is also able to heav-
ily disrupt the disk. We also observe this in our simulation where
the disk size can change quite drastically over time.
3.3. Residual velocities
From the analysis of the radial velocity it is clear that essentially
all material is falling onto the central sink in a free-fall man-
ner. This only leaves the residual motions perpendicular to the
infall as cause of the collimation of material into denser sheets.
Therefore, we analyse the residual velocities in more detail. In
Figure 10, we show the same map as in Figure 5 with the perpen-
dicular motions displayed on top where we use the azimuthal and

polar velocity components to determine the direction and mag-
nitude of the flow. As one can see, the density enhancements
coincide either with strong changes in magnitude of the flow or
where two flows converge. This means that the main locations
of the formation of accretion sheets are given by where gas withdifferent angular momentum collides and forms shock-like den-
sity enhancements.
In order to emphasise this point, we also calculate the veloc-
ity divergence of the residual motions which we show in Fig-
ure 11. Note that this map only takes into consideration the az-
imuthal and polar velocities and neglects the radial velocity com-

ponent. Negative values of the velocity divergence shown in red
are areas where material is being compressed and positive val-
ues in gray show areas where material is being diluted. Compar-
ing the map to the density map of Figure 10, one can clearly
see that the areas of compression coincide with overdensities
which shows again that it is the flows of the residual motions
during free-fall which bring material together into denser accre-
tion sheets.
During infall, there will be a wide range of angular momen-
tum. Gas with more eccentric orbits will at some point cross the
orbits of the more radially dominated orbits of the denser accre-
tion sheets. This means the density enhancements will accumu-
late more and more material along their way, leading to fewer but
even denser structures. We show this e ffect in Figure 12. From
top to bottom we plot the density and velocity divergence at fur-
ther and further distances. As one can see, as the size and contrast
of structures visible in the density goes down the farther out we
go, the residual motions define more and more small scale con-
vergence zones. Even at large distances, where radial collapse
has not yet collimated a lot of material and the residual motions
are still dominated by the turbulent velocity field of the filament,
one can already observe convergence zones. This suggests that
the initial seeds of overdensities are given by the turbulent mo-
tions on large scale. In order to verify that it is the turbulent ve-
locity field which creates this pattern, we also plot the velocity
divergence around the core of Figure 1 at 93 .2 kyr before the
collapse in Figure 13. Here, the forming core only consists of an
overdensity of a factor of two. As one can see, even at this early
stage where their is no radial collapse yet, a very similar pattern
is visible. This means that the initial turbulence on large scales
indeed sets the formation pattern of the dense accretion sheets.
One can also measure the collimation of material during in-
fall in the density probability distribution at di fferent distances
as shown in Figure 14. From light to dark blue, we plot the den-
sity probability distribution of spherical shells starting from large
distances down to close to the disk. One can see a systematic
trend where the density at large distances follows a log-normal
distribution with a dispersion of σ=0.62±0.02, whereas if one
goes closer to the disk, one can see the development of a power-

law tail. In that regard, the evolution from larger to smaller radii
follows a similar process as the density in a turbulent box under
gravitational collapse. The longer gravity is able to compress the
material, the more pronounced the power-law tail becomes. This
suggests the same process is happening during the infall onto the
central sink. Indeed, if we fit a power-law to the high-density tail
we get a similar but slightly smaller index of −1.33±0.03 as
in simulations of turbulent boxes which vary around -1.5 up to
-2.5 (Kritsuk et al. 2011; Federrath & Klessen 2013). This sug-
gests that gravity plays an essential role for the evolution of the
overdensities which we will explore in the following subsection.

3.4. Are the overdensities gravitationally dominated?
In order to explore the question if the overdensities gravitation-
ally dominate their local environment, we calculate the diver-
gence of the acceleration field analogously to the velocity field
and show the results in Figure 15. Negative values coloured
in red show areas where material is gravitationally compressed
while positive values coloured in blue show areas where mate-
rial is being gravitationally pulled apart. Very prominent is the
gravitational attraction of the disk itself, pulling material into
the central plane. It dominates over the gravitational pull of the
streamers except for the area towards the right hand side of the
viewing direction. Here it is interrupted by the gravitational field
of one of the densest streamers and a close-by sink particle whichpull the gas stronger into their direction, turning their vicinity
blue. Compared to Figure 5, one can see that there is a one-to-
one correspondence of the highest overdensities to areas with
large negative divergence of the acceleration. However, not all
structures are able to gravitationally pull material together. Some
overdensities visible in the density map have no correspondence
in the acceleration divergence map. We investigate this further
in Figure 16 where we show the mean and median acceleration
divergence as function of the density using the same bins as in
Figure 7. As one can see, only the very dense structures above
around 1.0×10−16g cm−3show a significant negative acceler-
ation divergence which means only the densest fraction of the
overdensities are able to gravitationally concentrate material at
this radius.
This pattern remains the same going to larger distances until
the gravitational pull onto the central axis of the filament domi-
nates as can be seen in Figure 17. Compared, to the small scale
velocity divergence at large distances visible in Figure 12, the
missing gravitational divergence of small scale structure means
that overdensities are mainly initialised by the velocity field.
During infall, they are collimated and accrete enough material
to gravitationally dominate their vicinity and gather even more
material. This explains the increase in non-radial orbits of low
density material which can be easily pulled towards the dense
streamers seen in Figure 7 as well as the development of a power-
law tail in the density probability function observed in Figure 14.
4. Comparison to related work
Our main finding that the accretion is set by the large-scale en-
vironment agrees with other simulations such as Ku ffmeier et al.
(2017), Bate (2018) and Lebreuilly et al. (2021). We show that
the formation of overdensities occurs naturally in a turbulent en-
vironment due to the initial velocity field. We find that this has a
strong influence on where mass is accreted onto the disk. How-
ever, this e ffect may depend strongly on the included physics.
For example, the simulation of Lee et al. (2021) which includes
magnetic fields finds a centrally concentrated mass accretion.
Although the general outcome of overdensity formation dur-
ing collapse is robust for di fferent initial conditions, we made
several simplifications in our simulations. We conducted this
work in order to set a baseline to compare future parameter stud-
ies to. Of major importance would be the inclusion of magnetic
fields. Depending on the strength of the magnetic field, it can
have a significant impact on the gas dynamics, potentially lead-
ing to a reduction of overdensities. Magnetic fields also have a
strong e ffect particularly on the sizes of disks due to magnetic
braking and outflows (Allen et al. 2003; Galli et al. 2006; Price
& Bate 2007; Hennebelle & Fromang 2008; Du ffin & Pudritz
2009; Commerçon et al. 2010; Seifried et al. 2011, 2012b) which
typically leads to rather small disk radii. While we deliberately
did not analyse the disk properties in this study, we do find a
rather large disk. However, it is still in a very dynamic stage
where the size can vary quite drastically. Moreover, depend-
ing on dust properties and cosmic-ray ionisation rates, non-ideal
MHD e ffects can reduce the impact of strong magnetic fields,
which again leads to more frequent disk formation and larger
disk sizes (Shu et al. 2006; Tsukamoto et al. 2015a; Masson et al.
2016; Zhao et al. 2016, 2018; Wurster & Bate 2019). Further-
more, there is also evidence that the e ffect of magnetic breaking
can be reduced by non-idealised initial conditions where turbu-
lence plays an essential role, not necessarily for magnetic re-
connection, but by misaligning the angular momentum from the
magnetic field vector (Hennebelle & Ciardi 2009; Seifried et al.
Article number, page 10 of 12S. Heigl et al.: Protostellar disk accretion in turbulent filaments
2012a, 2013; Joos et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013; Wurster et al. 2019;
Hirano et al. 2020). A comparison of the accretion including
MHD e ffects will be the focus of a future study.
In addition, while many studies include a barotropic
equation-of-state in order to mimic thermal e ffects of the disk
above the opacity limit, radiative feedback from the star has been
shown to a ffect the temperature structure and therefore the frag-
mentation of the disk (Commerçon et al. 2010; Tsukamoto et al.
2015b). Moreover, thermal pressure is able of driving outflows
even in the complete absence of magnetic fields (Bate 2011; Bate
et al. 2014). To which extent radiative feedback has an e ffect on
overdensities in the accretion flow has to be explored in future
simulations
5. Conclusions
In this study, we simulated the collapse of a core which forms
self-consistently within a turbulent filament in order to anal-
yse the origin and properties of overdensities in the accretion
flow. We analysed the morphological, kinematic and gravita-
tional properties of the core before and during the collapse in
great detail and are able to draw the following conclusions:
1. Overdensities in the accretion flow are created naturally as
a consequence of the initial turbulent velocity field. This ve-
locity field is set on large scales and is already present before
the collapse.
2. Instead of having a filamentary morphology, we find that the
overdensities in our simulation are rather sheet-like where
the observable accretion pattern depends on the line-of-sight
projection. This morphology follows from the shock-like
convergence of residual motions during collapse.
3. The collapse is essentially in free-fall with no significant dif-
ference in the radial velocity of the high and low-density gas
despite it spanning several orders of magnitude. We only see
a slight tendency for lower angular velocities, e.g. more di-
rect radial infall, of the high density gas and higher angular
velocity, e.g. more eccentric infall, of the low density gas.
4. The mass accretion onto the disk di ffers drastically from an
idealised initial condition of a core with solid body rotation.
This is due to the fact that the core inherits a turbulent veloc-
ity distribution from its environment with no generally or-
dered rotation.
5. The turbulent velocity field defines a log-normal probability
density function at large radii which develops a power-law
tail at smaller radii, similar to the gravitational collapse in a
turbulent box.
6. Both, the increase in angular velocity at low densities and
the development of a power-law tail at large densities, are
a consequence of the gravitational pull of the most massive
overdensities which are able to gravitationally dominate their
local environment. This leads to more and more collimated
structures over time during the infall.
