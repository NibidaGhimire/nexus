The gravitational lensing effect at higher order under weak-field approximation is believed to be
important to distinguish black holes and other compact objects such as wormholes. The deflection
angle of a generic wormhole is difficult to solve analytically; thus approximation methods are im-
plemented. In this paper, we investigate the weak-field deflection angle of a specific wormhole, the
Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, up to the 1 /b4order. We use different approximation formalisms, study
their precision at 1 /b4order by a comparison to a purely numerical result, and finally rank these
formalisms by their accuracy. Moreover, we find that certain formalisms are sensitive to the choice
of coordinate system; thus it is important to choose the coordinate system appropriately for the
evaluating of lensing physics.
I. INTRODUCTION
Gravitational lensing is an important probe to study
the physics of compact objects [1, 2]. The recent as-
trophysical discovery, such as the observation of gravita-
tional waves from compact objects [3], made it possible
to detect compact objects through lensing physics in the
near future. Thus, there is a growing interest in the study
of gravitational lensing, and some up-to-date work can be
found in [4–19].
The lensing effect is extensively studied for different
lenses [20–25]. Unfortunately, it turns out to be difficult
to distinguish black holes (BHs) and other compact ob-
jects such as wormholes (WHs)[26, 27] and boson stars
[28]. Those compact objects can mimic the behavior of
a black hole [29–33], and we are unable to observation-
ally exclude their existence at the present stage [34–37].
In view of the theoretical importance of black holes as
well as other compact objects, it is essential to search for
distinctive features of these compact objects [38–46].
There are two motivations for us to consider the lensing
effect from a wormhole. On the one hand, recent devel-
opments on the light ring reveal unavoidable instabilities
for a large variety of horizonless compact objects (and
∗tcaiac@connect.ust.hk
†zwangdq@connect.ust.hk
‡hyat@mail.bnu.edu.cn
§mzhuan@connect.ust.hkthus exclude the possibility for them to be astrophysi-
cally observed), while wormholes might be free from these
instabilities [47–49]. On the other hand, lensing effect
from higher-order contributions might be eligible to dis-
tinguish black holes and their correspondent wormholes
in the weak-field limit [50, 51]. However, it is gener-
ically difficult to analytically resolve the deflection an-
gle for lenses with a complicated metric. Approximation
methods are then developed to simplify the evaluation
procedure, for example, the Amore-Diaz (AD) formal-
ism [52], the formalism through Gauss-Bonnet theorem
(GBT) [53], and the post-post-Newtonian (PPN) meth-
ods developed by Keeton and Petters [54]. While these
methods yield rather accurate results at leading order,
their predictions on higher-order contributions are dif-
ferent from each other. Unfortunately, recent research
pointed out that contributions from higher-order terms
are important to distinguish different lens objects, for
example, the black holes and their mimicker (see, e.g.,
[51]). Thus, it is important to clarify the precision of the
gravitational lensing effect with different approximation
methods.
In view of the above argument, we study the higher-
order gravitational lensing effect with different approx-
imation methods, in an exemplified wormhole. One of
the most well-known wormhole solutions is the Ellis-
Bronnikov wormhole (EBWH), discovered in 1973 [55–
57]. It is based on the theory of Einstein gravity coupled
to a free scalar field, which is referred to as a “phan-
tom field.” This field is defined by flapping the sign ofarXiv:2302.13704v2  [gr-qc]  1 Aug 20232
its kinetic term in the Lagrangian. It was originally be-
lieved that this phantom field causes instability in the
EBWH, but a recent study has argued that the instabil-
ity can be cured [58]. Additionally, another study sug-
gests that slow rotation can stabilize the EBWH [59]. As
a simple yet significant model of a traversable wormhole,
the gravitating lensing effect of the EBWH has garnered
widespread attention in the scientific community. Most
studies on the lensing effect have focused on a special case
of the EBWH, where the wormhole mass is zero [60–70].
In this work, we extend the study to the full EBWH
metric and evaluate the deflection angle up to the 1 /b4
±
order in the weak-field limit ( b±is the rescaled impact
parameter). We find that the PPN result is the most ac-
curate one. When the weak-field condition is better sat-
isfied, the GBT formalism is more precise than the AD
formalism. When the weak-field limit is less satisfied,
the AD formalism might yied better accuracy; however,
in this case the formalism based on weak field approxima-
tion might not be applicable. Moreover, we find that for
AD and GBT formalisms, the results are sensitive to the
choice of coordinate system when the corresponding de-
flection angle approaches 0 in the negative-mass branch
of universe.
The paper is organized as follows. We discuss the Ellis-
Bronnikov wormhole in Sec. II, then briefly introduce the
lensing physics in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, we make a peda-
gogical introduction to the approximation formalism, us-
ing the massless EBWH as an example. We present our
main result, the deflection angle for general EBWH up
to second order in different formalisms, in Sec. V, and
discuss the precision of different methods. We conclude
in Sec. VI.
Throughout this paper, we will adopt the Planck units
so that 8 πG=c= 1. We use the ( −,+,+,+) convention.
II. BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO
ELLIS-BRONNIKOV WORMHOLE
A. Theory and metric
One of the simplest ways to construct a wormhole so-
lution is by introducing a free phantom scalar field as
exotic matter in general relativity, namely
L=√−g(R+1
2(∂ϕ)2), (1)
where Ris the scalar curvature and ϕis a phantom scalar
field. The EBWH was discovered independently by Ellis
and Bronnikov in 1973 and is a spherically symmetric
solution. The line element of EBWH can be written as
ds2=−h(r)dt2+h(r)−1dr2+R2(r)dΩ2
2,
h=e−m
qϕ, R2=r2+q2−m2
h,
ϕ=2qp
q2−m2arctan(rp
q2−m2), (2)where ( m, q) are two integration constants. Here dΩ2
2
represents the unit solid angle for two dimensions. The
wormhole throat, which connects two asymptotic flat
spacetime regions, is located at the minimum of R(r)
and is at r=−m. These regions can be referred to as
Universe I where r∈(−∞,−m) and Universe II where
r∈(−m,+∞). When m̸= 0, the metric denotes an
asymmetric wormhole because Universe I is not a copy
of Universe II.
Specifically, the two universe would observe the worm-
hole with opposite signs and different absolute values:
M±=±me±πm/(2√
q2−m2). (3)
Ifm≥0 and q≥0, Universe I has a positive wormhole
mass while Universe II has a negative one. For more
details on the global structure of EBWH, refer to Ref.[71].
Later on, we may simply use the ±sign to refer to
the universe with an observed positive/negative mass,
if convenient. Moreover, we see the gravitational prop-
erty of the wormhole seen by Universe II is equivalent
to that by Universe I, as long as we make a transforma-
tionm→ −m. Thus, we may set m≥0 without loss of
generality. Although the two universes are asymmetric,
in our convention (3) they are written as symmetric as
possible, differing only by a transform m→ −m.
We mention that, the horizonless condition for EBWH,
i.e. the metric component g00is everywhere negative, is
imposed by q2> m2. Since we have set m≥0, the
condition can be simply written as q > m .
B. Special cases
When m= 0, the metric (2) reduces to the well-known
symmetric EB wormhole:
ds2=−dt2+dr2+ (r2+q2)dΩ2
2, (4)
where the light ring locates at r= 0 and without ISCO
in the whole spacetime.
In principle, the horizonless condition q2> m2forbids
the possible q→0 limit. However, if we naively set q= 0
in the metric (2), we may recover the Schwarzschild black
hole with mass m(see, e.g., [71] for more details). This is
in agreement with our intuition: the condition q2> m2
forbids the existence of a horizon, so when we take q= 0
andm̸= 0, we expect a black hole to come to exist.
III. BASICS ON GRAVITATIONAL LENSING
PHYSICS
A. Lensing geometry
For simplicity, we start with a static spherically sym-
metric metric
ds2=−P(r)dt2+Q(r)dr2+R2(r)dΩ2
2. (5)3
FIG. 1. The geometry of a lensing with a pointlike len.
We depict the lens geometry in Fig. 1. We may treat
the lens object (in our case the wormhole W) to be a
point, as long as the scale of lensing geometry is much
larger than the lens object. A light ray is emitted at an
angle βfrom the source S, but deflected by the lens such
that the observer Oreceived it at an angle θ. We use the
deflection angle αto measure the deflection of light. In
the metric (5), the deflection angle has the following ex-
pression (the formulas are generalized by [72], compared
to the simple case, say, e.g., [73]):
α= 2Z∞
r0p
Q(r)/R(r)drq
R2(r)
R2(r0)P(r0)
P(r)−1−π , (6)
where r0is the distance of the closest approach of the
light to the center of the gravitational attraction.
Sometimes it is more convenient to use the impact pa-
rameter binstead of r0to describe the light ray. The
impact parameter bis defined as
b=R(r0)/p
P(r0). (7)
With the help of (6), we can relate the angle θandβ
by the lensing geometry. In the weak-field limit we have
Dlsα=Ds(β−θ), (8)
which gives a function β(θ). Observables may then be
evaluated from the function β(θ). For example, the mag-
nification is determined by the ratio between the solid
angles
|µ|=dΩO
dΩS=β
θdβ
dθ−1
. (9)
We see that the deflection angle αis essential in the
lensing physics. In the following, we shall restrict our-
selves to the property of α. Moreover, we are interestedin the weak-field regime, where we require bto be much
larger than any wormhole parameters (in our case b≫m
andb≫q). Thus, we expect the deflection angle to be
a series of m/b andq/b. In the current paper, we will
evaluate αup to the 1 /b4order.
B. Deflection angle for special cases
As pointed out in Sec. II B, the asymmetric EBWH
reduces to the Schwarzchild black hole and symmetric
EBWH in the limits q= 0 and m= 0, respectively.
Since the lensing physics of the latter two objects are
thoroughly studied, it would be important to compare
our result in the two limiting cases to the previous study.
For our purpose, we will take the massless EBWH as a
tool to illustrate different approximation methods in Sec.
IV. So we shall simply present the deflection angle for a
Schwarzschild black hole in the weak-field limit [74, 75]

IV. MASSLESS EBWH AS AN ILLUSTRATION
FOR DIFFERENT FORMALISMS
This section is a pedagogical introduction for the ap-
proximation methods, with the massless EBWH metric
ds2=−dt2+dr2+ (r2+q2)dΩ2
2, (12)
where qis the throat radius and dΩ2
2stands for the two-
dimensional unit sphere. The gravitational lensing effect
of massless EBWH is extensively studied in the literature
(see, e.g., [60–70]). The deflection angle for the metric
(12) is an elliptic function:
α= 2Kq
b
−π , (13)
where K(u) is the elliptic integral of the first kind, de-
fined as
K(u)≡Z1
0dxp
(1−x2)(1−u2x2). (14)
We can write the deflection angle (13) in the form
α=π∞X
n=1(2n−1)!!

where !! denotes the double factorial. Since we are in-

, (16)
We shall keep the result (16) as fiducial. In the follow-
ing sections, we shall evaluate the deflection angle of the
massless EBWH (12) with the three different formalisms,
and compare it with (16).
A. The AD formalism
The AD formalism [52] converts the complicated inte-
grals into a rapidly convergent series of solvable integrals.
Starting from (6), we make a change of variable z≡
r0/r, and an auxiliary function
V(z)≡z4
r2
0R2(r0/z)
Q(r0/z)+P(r0)r2
0
R2(r0)
−z4
r2
0R4(r0/z)P(r0)
Q(r0/z)P(r0/z)R2(r0), (17)
and the expression for αbecomes
α=Z1
0dzp
V(1)−V(z)−π . (18)
Up to now, the formalism is accurate. Now we write
the function V(z) as
Vδ(z) =V0(z) +δ(V(z)−V0(z)), δ∈(0,1).(19)
where V0(z) is some function that makes (18) solvable
(for example V0=λz2). If V(z) is of the form V(z) =P∞
n=1vnzn, we can expand the integral as a series of δ,
and integrate it term by term. The result, after taking
δ= 1, is
α=3π
2√
λ−1
λ3/2∞X
n=1vnzn−π . (20)
Finally, we shall assume that the αget the most accu-
rate values when dα/dλ = 0, i.e. the principle of minimal
sensitivity (PMS). The final result is
α=πrπ
2P∞
n=1vnzn−1
. (21)
We elaborate the procedure with the massless EBWH
(one may refer to [76] for more details). Here −g00=
g11= 1 and g22=r2+q2,so the deflection angle is
α= 2Z∞
r0p
r2
0+q2drp
r2+q2p

and the function V(z) becomes
V(z) =b2−2q2
b2z2+q2
b2z4. (23)From the expression (21), we can directly write
α=π"s

. (25)
The result is accurate in the first order, but disagrees
with (16). The difference is noticed in [62], and explained
as the failure of PMS near the throat r= 0.
B. The GBT formalism
The GBT formalism has been widely applied to lens-
ing physics since it manifests the physics in a topological
viewpoint. Here we show the lensing geometry in Fig. 2
from [53].
FIG. 2. The lensing geometry in weak-field approximation.
The two geodesics γ1andγ2represent light rays from the
source Sto the observer. The domain D1contains the lens
Lwhile L /∈D2. The two domains intersect at γ1, and we
require D2to be asymptotically flat at least in the neighbor
ofSandO. Finally, we need an auxiliary curve γLenclosing
L, and γP, which is the boundary curve of D2.
The strategy of GBT formalism is as follows. First,
the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a domain Dis
ZZ
DKdS +Z
∂Dκdt+X
iϕi= 2πχ(D). (26)
Here, Kandκare Gaussian curvature and geodesic cur-
vature. The angle αiare the exterior angles, while χ(D)
is the Euler characteristic number. The line integral is
done with respect to the affine parameter t(not to be con-
fused with the tcoordinate). The exterior angle is related
to the interior angle by θS=π−ϕSandθO=π−ϕO.
For our case, we shall assume the lens is nonsingular
so that χ(D) = 1. Notice that the geodesic curvature5
for a geodesic vanishes, so that κ(γ1) =κ(γ2) = 0. The
formula (26) for domain D1then gives
θS+θO=ZZ
D1KdS , (27)
which may help us to intuitively judge whether the lens
is convex or concave.
Applying the formula (26) to the domain D2, we choose
sufficiently remote SandOsuch that θS≃θO≃π/2, so
that
Z
γPκ(γP)dt=π−ZZ
D2KdS . (28)
Finally, for asymptotically flat domain D2, we have
κ(γP)dt/dα = 1, so the line integral is
Z
γPκ(γP)dt=Z
γPdα=π+α , (29)
so the deflection angle can be directly obtained by
α=−ZZ
D2KdS . (30)
Before proceeding, we shall mention that, the relation
between the deflection angle αfrom GBT formalism (30)
and the conventional one (6) is not clear at first glance.
Fortunately, there are vast literatures on the topic, where
the equivalence of the two deflection angle is established
in generic spacetime [77–86]. Therefore, in the EBWH
case, we can simply take the deflection angle evaluated
by (30) to be identical to the conventional one (6).
It is generically convenient to evaluate the surface in-
tegral in the optical metric. We elaborate the process by
the massless EBWH. For convenience we fix θ=π/2 due
to the spherical symmetry, so the null geodesic ds2= 0
gives
dt2=dr2+ (r2+q2)dφ2. (31)
The next step is to write the null geodesics in the form
dt2=habdλadλb=du2+ζ2(u)dφ2, (32)
and for massless EBWH, we already have u=r,ζ(u) =p
u2+q2, so the Gaussian optical curvature is

It is common to use straight line approximation, i.e.
rOE=b/sinφ, which is precise at leading order. Un-
fortunately, the straight line approximation will causeconsiderable deviation at higher order [67]. Since we are
interested in the higher-order correction to the deflection
angle, we need to introduce u= 1/rand expand it into
higher-order series of 1 /b[87] in our calculation. After
some straightforward calculations, we have

and we see that the improved result (36) also deviates
from the precise result in massless case (16). However, in
later sections we will show that, the improved GBT for-
malism in isotropic coordinates will result in an accurate
result up to q4/b4in massless limits.
C. The PPN formalism
The PPN formalism is based on a simple observation
that, in the weak-field limit, a wild range of physical
quantities can be expressed as a series of the effective
Newtonian potential. For a gravitational lens with mass
M, the effective Newtonian potential is Φ = M/r. No-
tice that we have used Planck units with 8 πG= 1, so in
principle, the coefficient Gin the definition of Φ should
lead to a factor of 1 /8π. However, since 1 /8πis only a
constant, we may suppress it for convenience by a rescal-
ing. This is equivalent to transfer the 1 /8πfactor from
Φ into the coefficients of Φ in the PPN series.
Before proceeding, we shall clarify some tricky issues.
First, as we shall see from (3), the gravitational masses
observed in Universes I and II are different. Thus we
shall specify which universe we are working with before
proceeding. Besides, for a complicated metric such as
EBWH, the expression for Φ is not obvious. For example,
the physical radius of EBWH is Rinstead of the rfrom
(2), so it is not clear whether we should use rorRin the
definition of Φ. Besides, the form of mass could change
in different conventions. For example, in some studies,
e.g., [88], the convention for EBWH is chosen such that
the Kepler mass in one side is mand in the other side is
−meπm/√
q2−m2. Thus if we apply different conventions,
the definition for Φ seems to be varying.
In view of the above argument, we need to be more
careful about what is an effective Newtonian potential.6
In the standard treatment of PPN formalism, we start
with the isotropic metric
ds2=−A(l)dt2+B(l) 
dl2+l2dΩ2
2
. (38)
The isotropic coordinate is defined such that the spatial
part of the metric is conformally flat, so that the light
cone appears round. In the rest of this paper, we will
uselto represent the radial coordinate as long as we are
working with isotropic coordinates.
Let us illustrate how the PPN formalism works in
the massless case. The metric for massless EBWH in
isotropic coordinate is (see appendix A for more details)
ds2=−dt2+
1 +q2
4l22 
dl2+l2dΩ2
2
. (39)
As one can see, we can simply define the effective New-
tonian potential Φ ∝q2/l2. Notice that Φ shows a q2/l2
dependence, instead of the conventional q/lone. This
is expected since the deflection angle (16) contains only
q2/b2term. Let’s naively take Φ = q2/4l2, and the metric
coefficients become
A(Φ) = 1 , B(Φ) = 1 + 2Φ + Φ2. (40)
Under the isotropic metric above, the deflection angle
should be expressed as
α= 2Z∞
r01
r2s
AB
1/b2−A/r2dr−π . (41)
Finally, only the nonzero even order terms remain. So
the deflection angle in PPN formalism is
α=π
4q

+9
64πq
b4
+Oq
b6
. (42)
Compared to (16), the result in PPN formalism is rela-
tively accurate considering the massless case.
From the above argument, it seems that we need two
PPN parameters to describe the massive EBWH, since
it contains two model parameters, qandm. Fortunately,
as we shall see in Sec. V C, it is still possible to use one
single PPN parameter to describe the lensing physics in
one side of EBWH.
V. DEFLECTION ANGLE OF MASSIVE EBWH
Now we come to the generic EBWH. Our strategy is
as follows. We use the AD formalism, the GBT formal-
ism, and the PPN formalism to evaluate the deflection
angle up to second order, in Sec. V A, V B and V C, re-
spectively. Then, we numerically evaluate the deflection
angle, and compare the numerical result to the above
methods in Sec. V D.Before proceeding, we mention that the metric compo-
nent in the isotropic coordinate is (see Appendix A for
details)

with the dimensionless constant being
γ≡mp
q2−m2. (45)
For the AD and GBT formalism, it would be useful
to do the calculation in the two coordinate system as a
consistency check.
Finally, when presenting the final result, we will meet
the following combination:
(±1)α+βmαqβ
bα+βe(±1)α+βmπ√
q2−m2. (46)
Such a combination seems more complicated than ex-
pected, and that is because the metric coefficients on
each side of the wormhole cannot be simultaneously set
to asymptotic unity. For simplicity we define the rescaled
impact parameter as
b±≡ ±be±mπ√
q2−m2, (47)
where ±correspond to wormhole sides with posi-
tive/negative mass as mentioned above. Now the expres-
sion (46) just simplifies to
mαqβ
bα+β
±. (48)
Compared to the massless case, the mass is introduced
and the impact parameter is rescaled in massive results.

In both cases, the results (51) and (52) agree with the

limit. Compareing the results (51) and (52) to the precise
one: in the q= 0 limit, they differ from (11) at the order

results in different coordinate systems at the 1 /b3

even if the underlying metrics are the same.

As we shall see, the results (55) and (58) differ at the
order 1 /b3

Before proceeding, let’s briefly comment on the result.
From (16) we see that, in the massless limit m= 0, the
accurate coefficient of the q4/b4term is 9 π/64, while the
GBT method in conventional coordinate and isotropic co-
ordinate yield 39 π/64 and −3π/64, respectively. There-
fore, we can intuitively deduce that the GBT formalism
is more accurate in the isotropic coordinate.
C. The PPN formalism
To proceed with the PPN formalism we need to know
the Newtonian potential Φ. However, it appears tricky
to define Φ in our case. Recall that the throat is located8
atr=−m, i.e., l= (q−m)/2; and the two asymptotic
region r→ ±∞ corresponds to l= 0 and l→ ∞ , re-
spectively. Thus, simple expressions such as Φ = m/2l
would not work for both sides. In fact, by the conven-
tional treatment, we shall define a Newtonian potential
that vanishes at a flat region. However, we cannot set
the two sides of the universe in (2) to be asymptotically
flat simultaneously. Therefore, we cannot expect a global
Newtonian potential satisfying both Φ( l= 0) = 0 and
Φ(l→ ∞ ) = 0.
Therefore, we shall use an alternative approach. We
shall define the two Newtonian potential, Φ −corresponds
to the r >−muniverse with negative mass, and Φ +
corresponds to the r <−muniverse with positive mass.
Moreover, as we see in Appendix A, Universe II can be
transferred to Universe I by a change of variable l→
(q2−m2)/4l. So without loss of generality let us first
work out the Φ −case.
In the Φ −casel >(q−m)/2 , and the weak-field limit
is valid at the region l≫q. Now for the large l, the
arctan function in (43) approximates to π/2, so let us
rewrite the coefficient A(l) as
A(l) = exp
γ

. (59)
Notice that at the asymptotic region A(∞) =
exp(−γπ)̸= 1, this is the cost we have to pay for the
metric (2), where the two sides are written as symmetric
as possible. Now, one may simply define
Φ−=−m
2γl, l∈(q−m
2,∞), (60)
and we may expand the metric components as

D. Numerical evaluation
Before proceeding, we shall set a “fiducial” result for
α, by expanding (6) as a series of q/b±andm/b±by

Not surprisingly, the result (68) coincides with the PPN
result (67). In PPN formalism we expand the deflection
angle as a series of Φ ±, and Φ ±itself can be seen as
a series of m/b±andq/b±. Therefore, the procedure
should be equivalent to expand αwith respect to m/b±
andq/b±directly, and we then recover (68).
Surely, we have no reason to claim (68) to be precise
up to the order 1 /b4
±. However, as we shall show in the
following, the result (68) shows the least deviation on
the numerical result, so we may comprehensively under-
stand the error in different methods, by comparing their
coefficients with that in (68).
As shown in Fig. 3, the approximation of analytical ex-
pansion (68) is satisfying, while the relative error quickly
decreases as parameters m/b±andq/b±decrease. In
isotropic coordinates the analytical expansion is identi-
cal, and thus Fig. 3 still fits.
The upper triangle region of Fig. 3 is the negative mass
side, and the lower region represents the positive mass9

pared with numerical result αnumfor both sides of EBWH.
side. On the positive mass side the relative error changes
smoothly, while on the other side it does not. There is
a light thin line on the negative mass side at which the
relative error is larger than neighboring regions, which is
because the deflection angle reaches zero and changes its
sign when crossing this line, causing the machine error to
dominate around this area. There is also a dark line on
the negative mass side, and this is simply the area where
analytical expansion reaches its best approximation. We
will see similar patterns for other approximation meth-
ods.
We depict the numerical results from AD formalism in
Fig. 4 and GBT formalism in Fig. 5, respectively. The
PPN result is already presented in Fig. 3. We show the
results of AD and GBT formalisms in both metrics, while
the PPN result only appears in the isotropic coordinate,
since the effective Newtonian potential is better defined
in the isotropic coordinate.
Let’s first come to the choice of coordinate system.
From Fig. 4, the AD formalism yields almost identical
results in the two coordinate system, except for the up-
per triangle region in the negative-mass branch, which
corresponds to a relatively large |q/b−|>10−2and a
relatively small |m/b−|<10−2.5. We comment that the
upper triangle region is exactly near the “critical line”,
where the absolute value of αapproaches 0 and the ma-
chine error may be important, as that in the analytical
case, Fig. 3. Therefore, the relative error in this region
is naturally inaccurancy. Thus we conclude that the AD
formalism is insensitive to the coordinate choice in most
of the parameter space.
On the other hand, one may directly see from Fig.
5 that the GBT method is much more accurate in the
isotropic coordinate. There seems to be a specific region
(the deep blue line in the upper channel of Fig. 5, cor-
responding to q/b−≃m/b−), where the relative error is
highly small in the original coordinate. Unfortunately,

theq=mcase would result in a apparent divergent
scalar field ϕ(2) and a divergent mass (3), so the pa-
rameter space may not be physically relevant. Thus we
conclude that it would be better to apply GBT formal-
ism in the isotropic coordinate in our exemplified EBWH
case.
Now let us come to the relative error in different meth-
ods. From Fig. 3, 4 and 5, we see that for the case of
EBWH, the PPN method is the most precise one. For
the reader’s convenience, we depict the difference of rel-
ative errors between AD and GBT formalisms in Fig. 6.
It is clear that, in original coordinates, the AD formal-
ism is more precise for large |q/b|and|m/b|, while the
GBT formalism is more accurate in weaker field limit.
However, in isotropic coordinates, the GBT formalism is
generally more accurate than AD formalism, except for
a minor parameter space.
A nice property about GBT formalism is that the
weak-field condition is better satisfied. We may naively
understand the result by comparing the AD and GBT
results to the analytic results. The leading deviation be-
tween the AD result (51), (52) and the analytic result10

The leading deviation between the GBT result (55), (58)
and the analytic result (68) occurs at the m3/b3
±term.
In other words, the GBT formalism has no error at the
m2/b2
±order, while the AD formalism starts to show er-
ror.
We conclude that, for the EBWH case, the PPN for-
malism is the most accurate one, while the accuracy of
AD and GBT formalisms depend on the parameter space.
However, we can always turn to the isotropic coordinate,
and then the GBT formalism becomes more precise than
the AD formalism in most of the parameter space.
VI. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
The higher-order effect in gravitational lensing may be
important to distinguish compact objects such as black

holes and wormholes. For complicated metrics, the de-
flection angle may be hard to evaluate, and the approxi-
mation methods are thus implemented. Although differ-
ent approximation methods give the same results on the
leading order, their predictions on higher order are dif-
ferent, so it is important to clarify which methods should
be more precise. In this work, we study the gravitational
lensing effect in the EBWH wormhole under the weak-
field limit to higher order. We evaluate the deflection
angle to the 1 /b4
±order, using the AD formalism, the
GBT formalism, and the PPN formalism, respectively.
By a direct comparison to the numerical result, we find
that the PPN formalism provides the most accurate re-
sult. Generically, the GBT formalism is more accurate in
the weaker field limit, while the AD formalism becomes
more precise in the presence of a stronger field. We also
find that AD formalism is insensitive to the choice of co-
ordinate, while the accuracy of the GBT formalism de-
pends highly on the coordinate system. Combining all
the above result, we find that the improved GBT formal-
ism [87] in the isotropic coordinate gives the most accu-
rate approximation, compared to GBT in the ordinary11
coordinate and the AD formalism.
Although in our case the PPN formalism yields the
best result, it might be complicated to figure out all PPN
parameters for sophisticated wormhole solutions. There-
fore, it is still valuable to estimate the deflection angle
using other formalisms at a higher order. In the EBWH
case, we find that the improved GBT formalism in the
isotropic coordinate is a good approximation, whose er-
ror appears at the 1 /b3order, thus we may attempt to
apply this formula for complicated wormhole metrics, if
the PPN formalism is too difficult to apply. However,
since we only considered the EBWH wormhole, it would
be too early to judge which formalism is better from our
result. It would be interesting to compare results from
different formalisms in a more generic wormhole metric
and decide which formalism should be better.
It is also interesting to improve the formalism, based
on the current result. For example, the AD formalism
gives different predictions in the original coordinate (2)
and isotropic coordinate (38). The difference may arise
from the PMS, where the condition dα/dλ is different
for different metrics. Would it be possible to improve
the accuracy of AD formalism by changing PMS to some
other principles that are coordinate-free? Besides, in the
GBT formalism, the lens is simply treated as a point
mass, which has no influence on the spacetime topology.
However, the wormhole is a geometric structure whose
existence may greatly change the spacetime topology. We
may study if the topological structure of the wormhole
shall be taken into account in the GBT formalism, and
if the change could improve the precision of the method.
Finally, to distinguish wormholes and other compact
objects, we need to evaluate astrophysical observables
such as magnification and event rate. It is possible that,
although the deflection angle differs for different compact
objects, the resulting observable signals are still highly
degenerate, whose difference is so small and below the
resolution of current experiments. Thus, it is important
to extend our result to astrophysical observables in con-
crete models, in the future.
