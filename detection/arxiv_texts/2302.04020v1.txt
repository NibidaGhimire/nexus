Abstract
In this paper, we give a suﬃcient and necessary condition for a regular element of a quantum
cluster algebra Oq(X) to be universally polynomial. This resolves several conje ctures bythe ﬁrst
author on the polynomiality of the cluster realization of qu antum group generators in diﬀerent
families of positive representations.

11 Introduction
Letgbe a semisimple Lie algebra. The quantum group Uq(g) was originally deﬁned by Drinfeld
[Dri90] and Jimbo [Jim85], which is a Hopf algebra deforming the universa l enveloping algebra U(g).
The Drinfeld’s double D(g) corresponds to the double of the Borel part Uq(b). To study the struc-
ture of quantum groups, one can embed them into simpler algebras s uch as a quantum torus algebra
Cq[T] or its skew ﬁeld of rational functions Cq(T). This was explored by Gerasimov–Kharchev–
Lebedev–Oblezin in [GKL05] and [GKLO05] by generalizing the Gelfand– Tsetlin representations
originally deﬁned for classical Lie groups, and they obtained an embe dding of Uq(sln) intoCq(T).
The Feigin’s homomorphism also provides an embedding of the positive B orel part Uq(b+) to the
quantum torus algebra [Ber96]. However, the embedding of the who le quantum group Uq(g) into
Cq[T] is more diﬃcult. For type An, this was solved by Kashaev–Volkov [KV98].
Meanwhile, these embeddings are related to quantum Liouville theory in physics, where the
Chevalley generators of Uq(g) act as positive self-adjoint operators on L2(R). TheUq(sl2) case was
studied by Schm¨ udgen [Sch96], Ponsot–Teschner [PT99][PT01].
To study this problem for general Lie types, Frenkel and the ﬁrst author introduced the notion
of positive representations for split real quantum groups in [FI14]. Split real quantum groups were
developed by Faddeev in [Fad95] and extended to its modular double in [Fad99], motivated from
string theory and conformal ﬁeld theory. Based on the idea by Sch rader–Shapiro in the case of
typeAn[SS19], by forgetting the real structure the positive representa tions lead to an embedding
of the quantum group Uq(g) of general Lie type into a quotient of a certain quantum torus alge bra
Oq(XD(i0)) associated to a quiver D(i0) [Ip18]. The quiver D(i0) is mutation equivalent to the
quiver for the moduli space of framed G-local systems PG,⊙, where⊙denotes the once punctured
disk with two special points on the boundary [GS22]. In later works, t his embedding was modiﬁed
in [Ip20] and [IM22] to give positive representations which are relate d to the quantization of the
classical parabolic induction, and certain degeneration of the gene ralized Casimir operators.
It was conjectured in [Ip18, Section 1.1] and [Ip20, Conjecture 7.1 ] that the images of Chevalley
generatorsof Uq(g) arepolynomialsinthe clustervariablesforanyclusterinthe mutatio nclassofthe
quantum torus algebra. It is also suspected that the same statem ent is true for the homomorphisms
introduced in [IM22]. The main goal of this paper is to resolve these co njectures.
Main Theorem (Theorem 4.9) .For the homomorphisms
κ:Dq(g)→ Oq(X)
κ:Dq(g)→ Oq(X)
κ0:Dq(g)→ Oq(X0)
described in Section 3.3, the image of the Chevalley generat orsEi,Fi,Ki,K′
iare all polynomials in
the quantum cluster variables with coeﬃcients in N[q±1]for any cluster in the mutation class.
The idea of the proof is to use candg-vectors, which are known to be sign coherent for skew-
symmetric seed data [GHKK14]. This allows us to control the degree o f the cluster X-variables after
each mutation, and leads directly to the proof.
It will be important to understand the geometric meaning of the poly nomiality of the image of
quantum groupsin the quantum cluster algebra. Just as the ringof Laurent polynomials C[Xk,X−1
k]
2describes regular functions on the torus, the polynomial ring C[Xk] is usually associated to regular
functions on the aﬃne space . Therefore we can expect an interpretation of the quantum grou ps to
be generalized from elements of the quantum torus algebra to eleme nts associated to quantum plane ,
motivated by [Ip13], in which C∗-and von Neumann algebraictechniques can be utilized to study the
multiplier Hopf structures of their images, thus building a new connec tion between Drinfeld–Jimbo
type quantum groups and non-commutative geometry.
Furthermore, it will be interesting to understand the combinatoria l description of the polynomial
images, where the coeﬃcients are expected to count certain cano nical objects associated to a given
cluster seed. In [SS17], this is answered explicitly for type Anquantum groups in the case of the
standard embedding, in which the coeﬃcients of the polynomial image s of the Borel part Uq(b) gives
a weighted count of the homologycycles aroundthe dual planarbipo lar graph of the associatedbasic
quivers. The Lusztig’s braid group action Ti0described in [GS22] can be interpreted as a sequence
of mutations which provides an S3action to the quantum group embedding for each triangle on the
surface, and the results of this paper shows that these embeddin gs remain a polynomial. For exam-
ple, in type E8and starting with the Coxeter words as initial seed, by a heavy brut e force check, the
f0generator is mutated up to a polynomial of 825887337 terms befor e reducing to the ﬁnal conﬁgu-
ration, with very curious coeﬃcients in N[q±1] represented in terms of ratios of q-numbers [Ip20]. It
will beimportanttogiveamorecombinatorialdescriptionofthesepo lynomialsandtheircoeﬃcients.
Finally, in [IM22], we proposed a program to classify the regular positive representations as
described in Section 5. One of the deﬁning conditions is that we have a homomorphism of the
quantum group into universally Laurent polynomials of some quantum cluster variety. The results
of this paper shows that all the classes considered so far have the image of quantum group lies in the
universally polynomial part of the quantum cluster variety, and it will be essential to unde rstand
whether this is characterization of such class of representations , or there are examples in between
that is yet to be discovered.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give the deﬁnition o f cluster varieties and
quantum cluster algebra in general. In Section 3, we give the deﬁnitio n of quantum groups. Then
we provide a summary of the works by the ﬁrst author and Man [Ip18 ], [Ip20], [IM22], as well as
the works by Goncharov and Shen [GS22], [She22] on embeddings of Uq(g) into cluster algebras. In
Section4, weusethesigncoherenceof c-vectorstogiveasuﬃcientconditionforaregularelementofa

provide some generalizations of the main theorem, including the amalg amation of multiple copies of

notion of regular positive representations introduced by Ip and Ma n in [IM22], in view of the new
results obtained in Section 4.
32 Preliminaries on cluster algebras
2.1 Basic deﬁnitions and properties
Wemainlyfollowthenotationin [FG09]and[GHK13]forthe AandXclustervarieties. However,
we slightly modify the deﬁnitions following [Nak21, Section 6], so that th e mutation formulas for
theAandXvariables match that used by the ﬁrst author in [Ip18], [Ip20] and a lso the original
deﬁnitions in [FZ02]. (See Remark 2.8.)
Deﬁnition 2.1. Aﬁxed data Γ consists of
•A ﬁnite rank lattice Nwith a skew-symmetric bilinear form
{·,·}:N×N→Q. (2.1)
•Anunfrozen sublattice Nuf⊂Nwhich is saturated , i.e. ifkn∈Nuffor some k∈Zandn∈N,
thenn∈Nuf. IfNuf=N, we say the ﬁxed data has no frozen variables.
•An index set Iwith|I|=n:= rankNand a subset Iufwith|Iuf|= rankNuf.
•Positive integers diwithi∈Iwith greatest common divisor 1.
•A sublattice N◦⊂Nof ﬁnite index such that {N◦,Nuf} ⊂Zand{Nuf∩N◦,N} ⊂Z. This
sublattice N◦depends on dias described in Deﬁnition 2.2 below.
•Lattices M:= Hom( N,Z) andM◦:= Hom( N◦,Z).
Deﬁnition 2.2. For any ﬁxed data Γ, a seeds:= (ei)i∈Iis a labeled collection of elements of N
such that {ei}i∈Iis aZ-basis of N,{ei}i∈Iufis aZ-basis of Nuf, and{diei}i∈Iis aZ-basis of N◦.
Given a seed s, we obtain a dual basis {e∗
i}forM, and a basis {fi}ofM◦given by
fi:=d−1
ie∗
i. (2.2)
We deﬁne the exchange matrix by
εij:=di{ei,ej}, (2.3)
which belongs to Zif at least one of i,jbelong to Iuf. The exchange matrix is skew-symmetrizable
with left skew-symmetrizer diag( d−1
i).
The exchange matrix correspondsto a quiver Qwhose vertices are labeled by I. For each i,j∈I,
if{ei,ej}>0, there are {ei,ej}arrows from itoj, and if{ei,ej}<0, there are −{ei,ej}arrows
fromjtoi.
Deﬁnition 2.3. The map
n/mapsto→ {·,n} (2.4)
is well deﬁned as maps p1:Nuf→M◦andp2:N→M◦/N⊥
uffrom the conditions {N◦,Nuf} ⊆Z
and{Nuf∩N◦,N} ⊆Zrespectively. Here taking dual of Nuf∩N◦→N◦gives the surjection
M◦→Hom(Nuf∩N◦,Z)withkernel N⊥

forp2. We choose a map p:N→M◦compatible with both p1andp2by restriction or quotient.
4Let [a]+:= max(0 ,a) and [a]−:= min(0 ,a).
Deﬁnition 2.4. Given a seed sandk∈Iuf, we deﬁne the mutation µk:N→Nby
µk(ei) =/braceleftigg
ei+[εki]+eki/\e}atio\slash=k
−ek i=k. (2.5)
It is obvious that {µk(ei)}i∈Iis still a basis for N,{µk(ei)}i∈Iufis still a basis for Nuf, and
{diµk(ei)}is still a basis for N◦. Then for the new seed µk(s) :={µk(ei)}i∈I, one checks that
µk(fi) :=d−1
iµk(ei)∗=/braceleftigg
fi i/\e}atio\slash=k
−fk+/summationtext
j[−εjk]+fji=k, (2.6)
and the exchange matrix changes as
µk(εij) :=di{µk(ei),µk(ej)}=

εij εikεkj≤0,k/\e}atio\slash∈ {i,j}
εij+|εik|εkjεikεkj>0,k/\e}atio\slash∈ {i,j}. (2.7)
Notethat thismatrixmutationcoincideswith themutationoftheexc hangematrixdeﬁned in[FZ02].
It can also be written as
µk(εij) =/braceleftigg
−εij k∈ {i,j}
εij+εik[εkj]++[−εik]+εkjk/\e}atio\slash∈ {i,j}. (2.8)
LetTbe the inﬁnite oriented rooted tree with |Iuf|outgoing edges from each vertex, labeled by
the elements of Iuf. We will label the root of Tbyt0, and we attach a seed s0tot0, called the
initial seed . Each node t∈Tcorresponds to a sequence of mutations and a seed stobtained from
the initial seed. We will use subscript t∈Tto specify which seed various terms are obtained from,
and we might omit the subscript for t=t0if we do not need to emphasize the seed. For example,
ift0k− →t1, thenεij;t1:=µk(εij).
Letkbe aﬁeld ofcharacteristiczero. Foranylattice NwithM= Hom(N,Z), the algebraictorus
TNoverkis the scheme TN:= Speck[M] wherek[M] is isomorphic to the group ring consisting of
k-linear combinations of zmform∈Mwherezis a formal variable.
For a given seed s, we consider the algebraic tori
Xs:=TM,s= Speck[N] (2.9)
As:=TN◦,s= Speck[M◦], (2.10)
where the subscript sindicates the choice of seed.
Deﬁnition 2.5. Fork∈Iufwe deﬁne the birational maps
µk:Xs/axisshort/axisshort/arrowaxisrightXµk(s)
µk:As/axisshort/axisshort/arrowaxisrightAµk(s)

wherevk=p(ek) ={·,ek} ∈M◦and/a\}bracketle{t·,·/a\}bracketri}htis the pairing between N◦andM◦. Note that these
maps implicitly depend on the choice of s= (ei)i∈I.
5ForXi:=zei,Ai:=zfi,X′
i:=zµk(ei), andA′
i:=zµk(fi), the mutation formulas are equivalent
to

As explained in the beginning, these formulas diﬀer from the mutation formulas for cluster variables
and universal rational functions deﬁned in [FZ02] and [FZ07] by a tr anspose of εjk.
Deﬁnition 2.6. TheFock-Goncharov A,Xcluster varieties is obtained by gluing the AsandXs

The map p:N→M◦induces a map p:A → Xgiven by p∗(zn) =zp(n), by directly checking

whereAis a product of Akover frozen k∈I\Iuf, which depends on the choice of p.
The Laurent phenomenon is a well-known result on the regularity of f unctions on AandX. For
a proof, see [FZ02], [GHK13, Section 3].
Theorem 2.7 (Laurent phenomenon) .For any seed s,
1. Letzm∈k[M◦]such that /a\}bracketle{tm,diei/a\}bracketri}ht ≥0for each i∈Iuf. Thenzm∈ O(A).
2. Letzn∈k[N]such that {ei,n} ≥0for each i∈Iuf. Thenzn∈ O(X).
In particular, any cluster A-variable Ai:=zfiis a regular function on A.
Such functions are called global monomials in [GHKK14]. In other literature, they are called
cluster monomials forAandstandard monomials forXrespectively.
Finally, we recall the tropicalization X(Ztrop) as follows. Let Ztropbe the semiﬁeld ( Z,+,min),
andQsf(M) be the set of subtraction-free rational functions in the ﬁeld of f ractions of k[N], which is
a semiﬁeld. We deﬁne TM(Ztrop) := Hom sf(Qsf(M),Ztrop). Since the monomials {zn}n∈Ngenerate
Qsf(M), we get a bijection
Homsf(Qsf(M),Ztrop)→Homgroup(N,Z) =M.
By the mutation formula, each mutation µ∗
konk[N] is invertible and involves only subtraction-free
expressions, so it induces an isomorphism on Qsf(M). This allows us to glue the TM(Ztrop) to give
X(Ztrop). Each choice of vertex in Tgives an identiﬁcation X(Ztrop) =M.
6We ﬁx using an initial seed s0for this identiﬁcation, which ﬁxes a choice of e∗
i∈ X(Ztrop). For
eacht∈T, let
xij;t:=e∗
i(µ∗
t(Xj;t))∈Ztrop, (2.16)
whereµtis the composition of pullbacks determined by t. Then for tk− →t′inT, applying e∗
ito the
mutation formula gives
xij,t′=/braceleftigg
−xik;t ifj=k
xij;t+[εkj;t]+xik;t+εkj;t[−xik;t]+ifj/\e}atio\slash=k. (2.17)
We also give another way of tropicalizing. Instead of ﬁxing the initial s eed and e∗
i∈ X(Ztrop),
we let
yij;t:=e∗
i;t((µ−1
t)∗(Xj))∈Ztrop.
Heree∗
i;tchanges with t, but we ﬁx the cluster monomials Xjin the initial seed.
Remark 2.8. Onthelevelofcluster A-andX-variables,thedeﬁnitionsusedhereandthedeﬁnitions
in [FG09] and [GHKK14] are related by taking a transpose of the exch ange matrix ( εij) introduced
in detail in [FG09, Section 1]. However, for the study of G-local systems, the two notations give
exactly the same cluster algebras because of the diﬀerent choice o f the Cartan matrix, which is also
oﬀ by a transpose.
2.2candg-vectors
In this section, we introducethe candg-vectors,which wereoriginallyintroducedin [FZ07] to de-
scribe the mutationofcluster algebraswith principalcoeﬃcients. H erewe followthe reinterpretation
in[GHKK14], whichallowedthem toprovethesign-coherenceconject uresintheskew-symmetrizable
case.
We ﬁrstneed todeﬁne the principalﬁxeddata, whichconstructst he clustervarietywith principal
coeﬃcients.
Deﬁnition 2.9. Given a ﬁxed data Γ, the principal ﬁxed data Γprinis the ﬁxed data with:
•/tildewideN=N⊕M◦with the Q-valued skew-symmetric bilinear form
{(n1,m1),(n2,m2)}={n1,n2}−/a\}bracketle{tn1,m2/a\}bracketri}ht+/a\}bracketle{tn2,m1/a\}bracketri}ht. (2.18)
Here the pairing M◦×N◦→Zis be extended to M◦×N→Qby/a\}bracketle{tei,m/a\}bracketri}ht=d−1
i/a\}bracketle{tdiei,m/a\}bracketri}ht.
•/tildewideNuf=Nuf⊕0⊂/tildewideN.
•/tildewideN◦=N◦⊕M.
•/tildewiderM=M⊕N◦,/tildewiderM◦=M◦⊕N.
•The index set /tildewideIis the disjoint union of two copies of I, withdithe same as in Γ. The unfrozen
indices is the original Iufin the ﬁrst copy of I.
7Deﬁnition 2.10. For any choice of initial seed s= (e1,···,en) for Γ, the initial seed of /tildewidesfor Γprin
is chosen to be
/tildewides:= ((e1,0),···,(en,0),(0,f1),···,(0,fn)) (2.19)
and gives a mutation class [ /tildewides]. For each t∈T, we will denote by /tildewidestthe mutation of /tildewidesalong the
sequence of unfrozen indices deﬁned by t.
We will denote the corresponding AandXcluster varieties for Γ prinbyAprinandXprinrespec-
tively.
Note that for st= (e1;t,···,en;t), it is not true that
/tildewidest= ((e1;t,0),···,(en;t,0),(0,f1;t),···,(0,fn;t)).
However, by deﬁnition of the mutation rule the ﬁrst half is still corre ct. Thus we still have a lift
Ai;t=zfi;tfromAst⊂ AtoAprin,st⊂ Aprin, where we identify fi;twith (fi;t,0)∈/tildewiderM◦.
We will denote the indices in the second copy of Ibyi′, corresponding to each iin the ﬁrst copy
ofI. In terms of the quiver Q, this corresponds to adding a frozen vertex i′for each iinQand an
arrowi′→isince{(ei,0),(0,fi)}=−1 by deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.11. For each t∈T, theC-matrixCtforstis then×n-matrix with entries
cij=/tildewideεi′j;t:=di{ei′,ej}, i,j∈I (2.20)
The column vectors cj;tofCtare called the c-vectors.
Forg-vectors, consider the surjection /tildewiderM◦→M◦given by ( m,n)/mapsto→m−p(n). This gives torus
action of TN◦onT/tildewideN◦. Explicity, let m−p(n) =/summationtext
i∈Icifi∈M◦. Then a point ( ai)∈TN◦acts by
(ai)·z(m,n)=/productdisplay
i∈Iaci
iz(m,n).
This action is compatible with mutation 2.12 since we have {·,(ek,0)}= (p(ek),ek), soz{·,(ek,0)}
has weight 0. Thus we get a torus action of TN◦onAprin. Clearly any cluster monomial z(m,n)is a
TN◦-eigenfunction under this action with weight m−p(n).
Deﬁnition 2.12. Theg-vectorgj;tis theTN◦-weight of the lift of Aj;ttoAprin. It is identiﬁed
with a vector in Znusing the basis ( f1,···,fn).
The following theorem on the sign coherence of candg-vectors is conjectured in [FZ07, Section
6] and proved in [GHKK14, Section 5].
Theorem 2.13. For each j∈I, the entries of cj;tare either all non-negative or all non-positive.
For each i∈I, thei-th coordinate of gj;tfor anyj∈Iare either all non-negative or all non-positive.
For later use, it is convenient to have an explicit mutation formula for thecandg-vectors, which
is originally given in [FZ07].
Lemma 2.14. Thec-vectors are given by the initial condition
cij;t0=δij (2.21)
and the mutation formula

8Proof.Immediate from the mutation formula in 2.7 and the initial conditions in 2 .9.
Lemma 2.15. Theg-vectors are given by the initial condition

and the mutation formula

Note that Al′;t=Al′;t0is ﬁxed under mutation because l′is frozen.
The two monomials in the mutation formula above must have the same TN◦-weight because
µ∗
k(Aj;t′) and each Al;t,Al′;tareTN◦-eigenvectors. Thus we can calculate the weight using the ﬁrst
term. By deﬁnition clk;t=εl′k;t, and the weight of Al′;t0=z(0,el)is−p(el). Hence the TN◦-weight
ofAj;t′is given by
gj;t′=−gj;t+/summationdisplay

l∈I[clk;t]+p(el;t0).
On the root t0∈T, theficoeﬃcient of p(el) is
di/a\}bracketle{tei,p(el)/a\}bracketri}ht=di{ei,el}=εil,
and the result follows.
Remark 2.16. By calculating using the second term instead, the mutation formula 2 .24 can also
be written as

Finally, we note that the mutation of c-vectors in 2.22 agreeswith the tropicalized mutation 2.17.
Thus we get the following lemma
Lemma 2.17. For any t∈T,xij;t=cij;t.
Meanwhile, using [NZ12, Eq. (1.13)] and Theorem 2.13, we get the follo wing lemma
Lemma 2.18. Letg†

for anyt∈T,
yij;t=g†

92.3 Quantization
To deﬁne quantum cluster algebras, we quantize the deﬁnitions in Se ction 2.1 as follows:
Deﬁnition 2.19. Letqbe a formal parameter. For any ﬁnite rank lattice Nwith1
dZ-valued skew-
symmetric bilinear form {·,·}, thequantum torus algebra kq[N] is deﬁned to be the noncommutative
algebra over kq=k[q±1/d] generated by znforn∈N, subject to the relations

ForOq(Xs) :=kq[N] andOq(As) :=kq[M◦], the quantization of the mutations 2.11 and 2.12 are
given by the pullback maps, and the image are elements on the division r ing (well deﬁned by the
Ore condition):

Ψq(x) :=∞/productdisplay
r=11

while Ad Ψis the conjugation by Ψ.
In parallel to the deﬁnition of XandA, we deﬁne the quantum upper cluster algebras Oq(X)

fori1,···,ik∈I. Note that Xi1,···,ik/\e}atio\slash=Xi1···Xik.
Many of the good properties in classical cluster algebras can be ext ended to quantum cluster
algebras. For example, we still have the injection p∗:Oq(X)→ Oq(A). The quantum Laurent
phenomenon is proved in [BZ05] for Avariables, and is extended to Xvariables using p∗in [GS22].
10Theorem 2.20 (Quantum Laurent phenomenon) .For any seed s,
1. Letzv∈kq[M◦]such that /a\}bracketle{tv,ei/a\}bracketri}ht ≥0for each i∈Iuf. Thenzv∈ Oq(A).
2. Letzv∈kq[N]such that {ei,v} ≥0for each i∈Iuf. Thenzv∈ Oq(X).
In particular, any quantum cluster A-variable Ai=zfibelongs to Oq(Aq).
ThetropicalizationintroducedinSection2.1canbe extendedto Oq(X) byrestrictingtothe semi-
ﬁeld homomorphisms that send q±1/Dto 0. Then it is checked easily that the tropical mutation for
quantum Xvariables agree exactly with the classical ones.
2.4 Amalgamation
Another important construction of cluster algebras is amalgamatio n, which corresponds to the
gluing of two quivers along frozen variables. This construction intro duced in [FG06] appears natu-
rally in the study of cluster algebras arising from higher Teichm¨ uller t heory, since we glue quivers
associated to triangles along their boundaries to get quivers for a g eneral surface.

We also have the simple positive coroots {α∨

j/a\}bracketri}ht=aij, and the fundamental
weights{Λi}i∈Isuch that /a\}bracketle{tΛj,α∨

The Weyl group Wis the group of isometries of Φ generated by the simple reﬂections si:=sαi.
It has a unique longest element w0, which induces an involution ∗:I→Isuch that
αi∗=−w0(αi). (3.3)

1This deﬁnition of diis the inverse of the one deﬁned in [Ip18] to match the multipl iers in the ﬁxed data. The
parameter qiagrees so the deﬁnitions of the quantum cluster algebras and quantum groups are the same as in [Ip18].
12Deﬁnition 3.3. The quantum group Uq(g) is given by the quotient
Uq(g) =Dq(g)//a\}bracketle{tKiK′
i= 1/a\}bracketri}hti∈I. (3.15)
Note that Dq(g) can be identiﬁed with the Drinfeld’s double of the Borel part Uq(b) of the
quantum group.
3.3 Cluster realizations of Dq(g)
3.3.1 Punctured disk realization
In [Ip18], the ﬁrst author constructed a quiver D(i0) for any reduced word i0ofw0, and showed
that there is an embedding Dq(g) into the quantum cluster algebra Oqfor this quiver. The image of
Fiare telescoping sums along certain Fi-paths, and the image of the K′
igenerators are monomials
along the Fi-paths. When i0is appropriately chosen, for example if iN=iwhereN=l(w0), so are
the images of EiandK′
i.
Theorem 3.4 ([Ip18, Theorem 4.14]) .Given a reduced word i0of the longest element of the Weyl
group, there is a quiver D(i0)of rank2l(w0)+2rgiving a quantum torus algebra Oq(XD(i0)), with
an embedding
ι:Dq(g)֒→ Oq(Xq,D(i0)), (3.16)
which descends to an embedding
ι:Uq(g)֒→ Oq(Xq,D(i0))//a\}bracketle{tι(Ki)ι(K′
i) = 1/a\}bracketri}hti∈I. (3.17)
These embeddings a priori depend on the choice of reduced word i0. In [Ip18, Section 7], it is also
shown that for diﬀerent choices of i0, the corresponding quivers D(i0) are related by mutations for
each braid relation. Based on this observation, the ﬁrst author su spected that there are embeddings
Dq(g)֒→ Oq(X), Uq(g)֒→ Oq(X)/I, (3.18)
which would be independent of i0.
This conjecture is proved in [GS22]. Goncharov and Shen construct ed the moduli space of G-
local systems PG,S, whereGis a split semisimple adjoint group over QandSis a decorated oriented
surface satisfying some mild conditions. A G-local system in PG,Sis a principal G-bundleLonS
with ﬂat connection with the following extra data:
1. Atboundaryspecialpoint m, aﬂatsectionoftheassociateddecoratedﬂagbundle LA=L×GA
on a small neighborhood of m.
2. At each puncture p, a ﬂat section of the associated ﬂag bundle LB=L ×GBon a small
neighborhood of p.
It is shown in [GS22, Section 10] that PG,Scarries a cluster Poisson structure, i.e. corresponds
to a cluster X-variety. There is an atlas for each choice of ideal triangulation for S, along with a
choice of vertex and also a choice of reduced word of w0for each triangle of the ideal triangulation.
Each of these atlases are related by a sequence of mutations. We t hen quantize this cluster algebra
and obtain the quantum upper cluster algebra Oq(PG,S).
There are functions Ws,i,Ks,i∈ Oq(PG,S) for each boundary special point sandi∈I, con-
structed geometrically from the G-local system deﬁnition of PG,S, then lifted to the quantum clus-
ter algebra. The functions Ws,iare called potential functions , which are conjectured to be the
Landau-Ginzburg potentials in mirror symmetry.
13WhenS=⊙is the once punctured disk with two boundary special points s,t, the quiver for
PG,⊙is mutation equivalent to the quiver constructed in [Ip18]. There is an outer monodromy map
µout:PG,⊙→H,
such that the condition µout= 1 corresponds to Ks,iKt,i∗= 1 for all i∈I. By [GS22, Lemma
15.5], the functions Ws,iandKs,ibecome monomials after a sequence of mutations, which satisfy
the assumptions in Theorem 2.20. Therefore, Ws,i,Ks,i∈ Oq(PG,⊙), and we have the following
maps into the usual quantum upper cluster algebra Oq(PG,⊙) and also Oq(PG,⊙)µout=1, improving
Theorem 3.4.
Theorem 3.5 ([GS22, Theorem 3.21]) .There is a canonical embedding
κ:Dq(g)→ Oq(PG,⊙) (3.19)
given by Ei/mapsto→ Ws,i,Fi/mapsto→ Wt,i∗,Ki/mapsto→ Ks,i,K′
i/mapsto→ Kt,i∗, which descends to an embedding
κ:Uq(g)→ Oq(PG,⊙)µout=1. (3.20)
The image is in fact invariant under a Weyl group action at the punctu re deﬁned in [GS22,
Section 13], but we do not need it and we will not describe it in detail her e.
In [She22], it is shown that when gis simply laced, the embedding κ:Uq(g)→ Oq(PG,⊙)
descends to an isomorphism
Uq(g)≃ Oq(LG,⊙),
where LG,⊙is obtained from PG,⊙by ﬁrst forgetting the framing at the punctures giving the space
LocG,⊙, then taking the ﬁber µ−1
out(1) over the identity 1 ∈H. This is also conjectured to be true
for general g. Note that the map forgetting the framing
PG,⊙→LocG,⊙
is a Galois W-cover, so the map κdescends to Oq(LocG,⊙) exactly by the fact that the image of
Uq(g) is invariant under the Weyl group action.
3.3.2 Parabolic realization
Based on Theorem 3.4, the ﬁrst author constructed a cluster rea lization of Dq(g) for each
parabolic subgroup PJ⊂Gfor any subset J⊂Iof Dynkin nodes [Ip20]. The simple reﬂec-
tions (sj)j∈Jgenerate the parabolic subgroup WJ⊂Wof the Weyl group. Let wJbe the longest
element of WJ. Then we can decompose w0as
w0=wJw
for a unique w∈W, and any reduced word iforwgives a quiver D(i).
LetOq(X) be the quantum cluster algebra associated to D(i).
Theorem 3.6 ([Ip20, Theorem 5.2]) .There is a homomorphism
κ:Dq(g)→ Oq(X). (3.21)
143.3.3 Zero Casimirs realization
In [SS17], Schrader and Shapiro described a mutation sequence for D(i), where g=sln+1and
i= (1,2,1,3,2,1,···,n,n−1,···,1), (3.22)
such that the new quiver contains a symmetric part with n+1 variables. Based on this mutation
sequence, the ﬁrst author and Man performed folding of these va riables and obtained a new quiver
and new quantum cluster algebra Oq(X0) [IM22]. In view of the embedding in 3.16, the folding of
cluster variables are related to the Casimir operators CkinDq(g), which gives the following result:
Theorem 3.7 ([IM22, Theorem 4.5]) .There is an embedding
κ0:Dq(sln+1)//a\}bracketle{tCk= 0/a\}bracketri}ht → O q(X0). (3.23)
Using an inclusion of a parabolic Akpart for general Lie types g, the embedding 3.23 can be
generalized as follows:
Theorem 3.8 ([IM22, Theorem 5.1]) .For any parabolic subgroup PJ⊂Gof typeAk, there is a
homomorphism
κ0:Dq(g)→ Oq(X0). (3.24)
whereOq(X0)is obtained by folding the symmetric part of the parabolic Akpart of the quiver D(i0).
4 Polynomial conditions
4.1 Main results
To prepare for the main theorem, we ﬁrst discuss the suﬃcient con ditions for monomials or poly-
nomials in the cluster X-variables for one seed to be universally monomial or universally polyn omial.
Consider a ﬁxed data Γ with a ﬁxed initial seed s0= (ei)i∈Ias in Deﬁnition 2.1–2.2.
Lemma 4.1. Letzv∈kq[N]be such that {ei,v}= 0for eachi∈Iuf. Thenzvis always a monomial
in the quantum cluster variables for any seed in the mutation class ofs0.
Proof.Sincezvandz−vboth satisfythe assumptionsin Theorem2.20, they areLaurentpo lynomials
in the cluster variables for any seed in the mutation class, hence the y must be monomials.
Proposition 4.2. For any seed st,t∈T, let
v=/summationdisplay
i∈I−Iufaiei;t,
for some ai∈Z≥0, and suppose {ej;t,v} ≥0for eachj∈Iuf. Thenzv∈kq[N]remains a polynomial
in the quantum cluster variables for any seed in the mutation class.
Proof.It suﬃces to check at the initial seed. By Theorem 2.20, µ∗
t(zv) is a Laurent polynomial.
Meanwhile, consider the tropicalization (2.16). For each l∈I, using Lemma 2.17 we get
e∗
l(µ∗
t(zv)) =/summationdisplay
i∈I−Iufaixli;t=/summationdisplay
i∈I−Iufaicli;t.
Since the frozen vertices i∈I−Iufare never mutated, cii;t= 1 by deﬁnition. By sign coherence of
c-vectors, cli;t≥0 for all l∈I. This shows that e∗
l(µ∗
t(zv))≥0 for all l∈I, so the power of each
Xlinµ∗
t(zv) is non-negative and µ∗
t(zv) is a polynomial.
15The condition in Proposition 4.2 is suﬃcient but not necessary. For ex ample, for the quantum
cluster algebra associated to the Markov quiver (without frozen v ertices), the monomial X1X2X3is
invariant under mutation, hence universally polynomial.
It is interesting to ask exactly which standard monomials are univers ally polynomial, or more
generally, what exactly is the subring of universal polynomials in O(X) orOq(X). A necessary
condition is given as follows.
Fix an initial seed s0with the corresponding cluster X-variables X1,···,Xn. Letf∈ Oq(X) be
a polynomial in Xi, such that each monomial appearing in fdetermines a vector /vector vinZn
≥0. Let/tildewideGt
be the matrix for g†
ji;tas described in Lemma 2.18.
Proposition 4.3. fis universally polynomial if and only if /tildewideGt/vector v∈Zn
≥0for allt∈Tand all/vector v.
Proof.The forward direction is proved in the same as Proposition 4.2. Conve rsely, suppose /tildewideGt/vector v/\e}atio\slash∈
Zn
≥0for some t∈Tand/vector v. By [NZ12, Proposition 4.2] and Theorem 2.13, /tildewideGtis invertible, so /tildewideGt/vector vis
distinct for diﬀerent /vector v. Recall from Lemma 2.18 and the deﬁnition of yij;tthat/tildewideGt/vector vcorresponds to
the lowest degree term with respect to st. This shows that its negative powers do not cancel and f
has a term with negative powers in the seed st.
While Proposition 4.3 characterizes all universal polynomials, we do no t know a good way to
compute the exact condition, as there are in general inﬁnitely many /tildewideGtwhentranges through
T. However, using the language of [GHKK14], g-vectors are generators of the chambers in the
cluster complex ∆+(Z), which is the collection of cluster chambers, each of which is a cone in the
tropicalization A∨(Ztrop). Thus we can reinterpret the condition as follows.
Corollary 4.4. Letf∈ Oq(X). Thenfis universally polynomial if and only if for each monomial
znappearing in fin some seed s,/a\}bracketle{tn,m/a\}bracketri}ht ≥0for each m∈∆+(Z).
Example 4.5. IfAhas a large cluster complex, ∆+(Z) does not lie in a half space, so there are no
non-trivial universal polynomials in Oq(X). This happens if for example Ahas an acyclic seed, or
has a seed with a maximal green sequence [GHKK14, Corollary 8.30].
This shows that in many cases, including the moduli space of local sys temsPG,Sin [GS22,
Theorem 2.13], frozen variables are necessary for Oq(X) to have non-trivial universal polynomials.
Example 4.6. Consider the standard quiver described in Section 3.3 for the embed ding ofDq(2)
in Figure 1, where 1 ,3 are frozen.

234
Figure 1: The quiver for Xstd

It is easy to compute that
O(X) =k[X±
2,X±
4,(X1X3)±,X3(1+X4),X1(1+X2)]. (4.1)
16This quiver is skew-symmetric, so the transposed seed is just itself . The matrices /tildewideGtfor the 4
possible seeds are

1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
,
1 0 0 0

1 0 0 0
1−1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 1 −1

respectively, so the condition in Proposition 4.3 is just d1≥d2andd3≥d4for each monomial
Xd1
1Xd2
2Xd3
3Xd4
4with alldi≥0. Then the subring of universal polynomials is given explicitly by
k[X1(1+X2),X3(1+X4),X1X3,X1X2X3,X1X3X4,X1X2X3X4], (4.2)
which can also be written as (using′to denote the variables in mutated seeds)
k[X1X3,µ∗
2(X′
1),µ∗
2(X′
1X′
3),µ∗
4(X′′
3),µ∗
4(X′′
1X′′
3),µ∗
2µ∗
4(X′′′
1X′′′
3)].
Thus in this case the monomials in Proposition 4.2 generate the univers al polynomials.
Remark 4.7. In Proposition 4.3, the criterion does not determine whether f∈kq[X1,···,Xn]
belongs to Oq(X), so we need to assume f∈ Oq(X). It raises the question on the exact size of
O(X) orOq(X), for example whether it is generated by standard monomials. This q uestion on
theX-side parallels the question whether a cluster algebra coincides with it s upper cluster algebra,
which happens on the A-side [BFZ05].
The following lemma gives a class of functions which are universally polyn omial.
Lemma 4.8. LetXbe a cluster variety deﬁned by a quiver Q. Suppose Qcontains a type An
subquiver Q′indexed by 1,...,n, where the vertices 1andnare frozen and there is an arrow (i→
i+1)for each i= 1,...,n−1. Suppose for any unfrozen vertex v∈Q−Q′,
•there are no arrows (1→v),
•for anyv′∈Q′, there is at most one arrow (v→v′)or(v′→v),
•whenever there is an arrow v→v′, there is another v′′∈Q′with(v′′> v′)with an arrow
(v′′→v), andvis non-adjacent to any vertices in Q′betweenv′andv′′.

are universally polynomial.

Proof.Starting from Figure 2, we ﬁrst mutate at 2 to get the quiver in Figur e 3.
By direct computation,
µ∗
2(X′
1+X′
1,3+X′
1,3,4+···+X′

µ∗
2(X′
1,3,4,···,n) =X1,2,···,n.
Then we mutate at 3 ,···,n−1 to get the quiver in Figure 4.
Inductively, we get the result
µ∗(X′′
1) =X1+X1,2+···+X1,2,···,n−1,
µ∗(X′′
1,n) =X1,2,···,n.
In order to apply Proposition 4.2, we need to descibe the arrows bet ween 1,nand vertices in
Q−Q′. For any v∈Q−Q′, initially if there are arrows between vand 1, it must be a single arrow
(v→1), then by assumption there is another v′∈Q′with an arrow ( v′→v). Then the arrow
(v→1) cancels after mutating at (2 ,3,...,v′). Similarly, all arrows between vandncancel after
mutation. Thus the only arrows involving 1 and nat the last step of the mutations are ( n→n−1)
and (n−1→n) only as seen in Figure 4, and the assumption in Proposition 4.2 is satisﬁ ed.
Finally, we introduce and prove the main theorem of this paper.
Theorem 4.9. For the homomorphisms
κ:Dq(g)→ Oq(X)
κ:Dq(g)→ Oq(X)
κ0:Dq(g)→ Oq(X0)
described in Section 3.3, the image of the Chevalley generat orsEi,Fi,Ki,K′
iare all polynomials in
the quantum cluster variables with coeﬃcients in N[q±1]for any cluster in the mutation class.
Proof.The image of FiandK′
iinOq(X) are given by
Fi/mapsto→X(i
−ni)+X(i
−ni),(i
−ni+1)+···+X(i
−ni),···,(i
ni−1),
K′
i/mapsto→X(i
−ni),(i
−ni+1),···,(i
ni−1).
18Here/parenleftbigi
k/parenrightbig
are the indices used in [GS22], where each icorresponds to a positive simple root αi, andni
is the number of times αiappears in the reduced expression of w0used when choosing the seed for
X. By construction, the quiver D(i) is amalgamated from triangular quivers based on the Dynkin
diagram, thus the assumptions in Lemma 4.8 is satisﬁed, and Fi,K′
iare mapped to polynomials in
the cluster variables for any cluster in the mutation class.
ForEiandKi, we can choose a reduced word iforw0such that iN=i. Then it is known
[Ip18] that the image of EiandKiare mutation equivalent to the telescopic sum and monomial
respectively as in (4.3)–(4.4), along the Ei-path, which is just an A3quiver. Lemma 4.8 again shows
thatEi,Kiare mapped to polynomials in the cluster variables for any cluster in th e mutation class.
For the parabolic representations, the argument for FiandK′
iis the same since the Fipaths
remain type An. ForEiandKi, we might no longer be able to choose freely the reduced word
iN=idue to restriction by the decomposition w0=wJw. We instead use the mutations involved
in the proof of [Ip20, Lemma 5.18], which shows that the image of Ei,Fi,Ki,K′
iare regular. It is
shown that there is a sequence of quantum cluster mutations that send the images into a monomial
(a single variable in the case of EiandFi) having the same adjacency to the quiver of D(i) in the
standard embedding κ. Therefore, the images also satisfy the conditions in Proposition 4.2 , and the
same conclusion follows for Oq(X).
For the zero Casimir representations, the result follows immediately from a general property of
cluster folding Corollary 4.14, which we will discuss in Section 4.2.
As for the coeﬃcients, the result follows from the main theorem of [D M21], where Davison and
Mandelshowedthatforskew-symmetricquantumclusteralgebra s,the quantumthetafunctions have
coeﬃcients in N[q±1] in any seed. Since standard monomials are theta functions, this imm ediately
implies our result when Gis simply laced. For general G, we can unfold the cluster algebra to
obtain a skew-symmetric one. Standard monomials in the folded clust er algebracome from standard
monomials in the unfolded one, so they also have coeﬃcients in N[q±1] in any seed.
Example 4.10. For any simple g, the generalized Casimir elements [KS98] are given by
Ck:= (1⊗tr|q
Vk)(RR21) (4.5)
where
•Vkis thek-th fundamental representation of Uq(g) fork= 1,···,n,
•tr|q
Vkis the quantum trace over Vk, and
•Ris the universal R-matrix.
The generalized Casimir elements lie in /hatwideUq(g) :=Uq(g)[K±1
h
i], where his the Coxeter number of g,
and they generate the center of /hatwideUq(g). We can modify this construction to Dq(g) as well, and it can
be shown that in /hatwideDq(g),
Ck=KkCk (4.6)
for each k, whereKkis the Cartan part consists of product of rational powers of Ki,K′
i, whileCk
is a polynomial in Ei,Fi,Ki,K′
i. Then Theorem 4.9 shows that the polynomial part is universally
19polynomial in Oq(X).
For example, in sl2, the unique generalized Casimir element is given by
C=FE−qK−q−1K′. (4.7)
There is no Cartan part here, and Cis indeed a polynomial in Ei,Fi,Ki,K′
i.
In the standard embedding Dq(sl2)֒→ Oq(X), the image of CisX1,2,3,4+X1,3which is indeed
universally polynomial as shown in (4.2).
4.2 Cluster folding
The positive representations with zero Casimirs involves cluster fold ing, originally deﬁned in
[FG09, Version 3 Section 6] and [FG06, Section 3.6] to apply folding of r oot systems to the moduli
spaces of G-local systems. To apply Theorem 4.9, we will deﬁne a slightly more res trictive version
requiring more symmetry to obtain better properties.
Deﬁnition 4.11. For any ﬁxed data Γ with seed s= (ei)i∈I, suppose there is a ﬁnite group Σ
acting on Ipreserving Iuf⊂Isuch that
{eσ(i),·}={ei,·} (4.8)
for alli∈Iandσ∈Σ. Clearly Σ induces an automorphism of N. Then we deﬁne the foldingof Γ
to be a ﬁxed data ΓΣconsisting of:
•The index set I:=I/Σ,Iuf:=Iuf/Σ,di:=di/|O(i)|, whereO(i) is the orbit of i∈Iunder Σ.
•NΣis the invariant sublattice generated by s= (ei)i∈Iwhere
ei:=/summationdisplay
j∈O(i)ej, (4.9)
withNΣ
ufgenerated by ( ei)i∈Iuf, and (NΣ)◦generated by ( diei)i∈I.
•The skew-symmetric bilinear form on NΣis inherited from that on N, so
{ei,ej}:=|O(i)||O(j)|{ei,ej}. (4.10)
•Lattices MΣ:= Hom( NΣ,Z), (MΣ)◦:= Hom(( NΣ)◦,Z).
Fromthedeﬁnition, itisobviousthattherequirements {(NΣ)◦,NΣ
uf} ⊂Z,{NΣ
uf∩(NΣ)◦,NΣ} ⊂Z
are always satisﬁed. The numbers dimight not be integers, but this does not aﬀect any of our cal-
culations and we can always ﬁx this by rescaling if necessary.
In the remainder of this section, we will always assume that Γ has a fo ldingΓ deﬁned using the
initial seed s0.
Deﬁne analogously fi:=d−1
ie∗
i,εij:=di{ei,ej}and the cluster varieties XΣ:=XΓΣ,AΣ:=AΓΣ
and similarly Oq(XΣ),Oq(AΣ) respectively.
LetTbe the inﬁnite oriented rooted tree for ΓΣ. We deﬁne an injection ι:T→Tas follows:
201. The root t0ofTis mapped to the root t0ofT.
2. Inductively, suppose ι(t) is already deﬁned and tk− →t′inT. We choose an arbitrary or-
derk1,···,k|O(k)|of the orbit O(k) ofkand move from ι(t) along the edges labeled by
k1,···,k|O(k)|in such order giving the vertex ι(t′).
The following lemma shows that the folding ΓΣis independent of the seed stfort∈ι(T).
Lemma 4.12. For anyt∈T, the seed sι(t)also deﬁnes a folding. Then NΣ
t=NΣ, and the following
diagram commutes
NΣN
NΣNµt µι(t)
where the horizontal maps are inclusions.
Proof.We reduce to the case t0k− →tby induction.
By the assumption in Deﬁnition 4.11 and the mutation formulas in Sectio n 2.1, if iandjhave
the same orbit, the mutations µiandµjare identical up to swapping iandj. In this case, εij= 0,
and it is also well known that the mutations µiandµjcommute. Thus we still have
{µiµj(ei),·}={µiµj(ej),·}.
This shows that the assumption in Deﬁnition 4.11 is still satisﬁed and ind uctively sι(t)also deﬁnes
a folding.
The condition NΣ
t=NΣis immediate since mutation sends NΣinto itself. Let µO(k)be the
composition of the commuting mutations µlover alll∈O(k). Then
µO(k)(ei) =/braceleftigg
ei+[εki]+eki/\e}atio\slash∈O(k)
−ei i∈O(k),
so we have
µO(k)◦(ei) =/braceleftigg
ei+|Oi|[εki]+eki/\e}atio\slash∈O(k)
−ei i∈O(k).
Since
|O(i)|εki=|O(i)|dk{ek,ei}=εki,
we getµt=µι(t)onNG.
The inclusion NΣ→Nalso induces an injection ι:kq[NΣ]→kq[N]. Unlike for Nabove, the
mutations for Xdoes not commute with ι, so we cannot glue them to an injection Oq(XΣ)→ Oq(X)
globally.
However, we note that the image of ιlies the the invariant subring kq[N]Σ. It is well known that
kq[N]Σis generated over kqbyEi,afori∈I,|a| ≤ |O(i)|, whereEi,ais the elementary symmetric
polynomial of degree |a|in the variables Xjfora >0 andX−1
jfora <0, over all j∈O(i). We have
ι(Xi) =Ei,|O(i)|.
Then by extending the map ιand the mutation maps to the completion of kq[NG] andkq[N]Σ
with respect to the ideal generated by the cluster variables Xi, we can still salvage the following
fact:
21Proposition 4.13. The injection ι: Frac(/hatwiderkq[NΣ])→Frac(/hatwiderkq[N]Σ)has akq-linear inverse πsuch
that the following diagram commutes
Frac(/hatwiderkq[N]Σ) Frac(/hatwiderkq[NΣ])
Frac(/hatwiderkq[N]Σ) Frac(/hatwiderkq[NΣ])π
µι(t) µ
π
Proof.For anyj∈O(i) andk/\e}atio\slash∈O(i) withεki≤0, we have
XkXj=q−2{ek,ej}XjXk=q2|εki|
kXjXk.
This shows that for i1,···,ia∈O(i),
µ∗
k(X′

We also have similar formulas when εik≥0.
Then the mutation µ∗

Note that qk=q|O(i)|
k. A direct comparison shows that ιidentiﬁes the mutation of Xiwith the
terms of the mutation of Ei,|O(i)|in Frac(/hatwiderkq[N]G) involving only Ej,|O(j)|forj∈I. This shows that
thekq-linear map πsendingEi,b|O(i)|toXb
iand all other Ei,ato 0 is the inverse of ιand commutes
with mutation.
We immediately get the following corollary which completes the proof of Theorem 4.9.
Corollary 4.14. Suppose f∈kq[N]is a polynomial in the quantum cluster variables for any seed
in the mutation class of s. Then so is π(f)for any seed in the mutation class of s.
224.3 Extension to general G-local systems
Our result can be extended to embeddings of Dq(g) intoOq(PG,S) for general G-local systems.
The main example is ⊙n, the disk with n-punctures and two boundary special points. The relation
between quantum groups and multiple punctured disk is ﬁrst investig ated in [Kas01] for n= 2,
[SS19] for general nandg=slr+1, and in [GS22] for general g.
Geometrically, ⊙nis obtained by gluing ncopies of ⊙along boundary intervals, thus by amal-
gamation, the cluster algebra Oq(PG,⊙n) is a subalgebra of the tensor product Oq(PG,⊙)⊗n. For
example, one checks that for n= 2,
Ws,i,⊙2=Ws,i,⊙⊗1+Ks,i,⊙⊗Ws,i,⊙ (4.13)
Ks,i,⊙2=Ks,i,⊙⊗Ks,i,⊙ (4.14)
and the formula for general ncan be derived inductively. Combining with the embedding κ, we
obtain the formula for the coproduct in Uq(g).
Corollary 4.15. Ws,i,⊙nandKs,i,⊙nremain polynomials in the quantum cluster variables with
coeﬃcients in N[q±1]for any cluster in the mutation class.
Proof.For each i, the cluster X-variables appearing in Ws,i,⊙nandKs,i,⊙nare still in the conﬁg-
uration of a type Anquiver. Therefore, the polynomiality result follows from Lemma 4.8. T he
statement about the coeﬃcients again follows from the main theore m of [DM21].
Remark 4.16. Note that the proof for the parabolic case in 4.9 also relies on mutatio ns into
polynomialsonly involvingfrozenvariables, and folding can be applied to eachOq(PG,⊙) separately.
Therefore, the same result still holds if for some copies of ⊙, the quiver for Oq(PG,⊙) is replaced
by the parabolic or zero Casimir variant.
For general marked surfaces, we no longer have the symmetry in ⊙or⊙n, so for any boundary
special point s, the embedding is restricted to only
Uq(b)→ Oq(PG,S),
where the choice of Borel subalgebra bis determined by the Borel subgroup from the framing at s
[GS22, Theorem 3.21]. Lemma 4.8 again shows that the image of EiandKiare also universally
polynomial in this case.
As mentioned in [GS22, Remark 15.3], the above result can be generaliz ed to arbitrary Kac-
Moodyb, where the map is no longer injective and the RHS is deﬁned directly us ing a quiver
without using G-local systems. Our polynomiality result extends naturally as well. Fu rthermore,
our result also applies to the rare example [Ip20, Proposition 4.10] wh ich maps the whole quantum
aﬃne algebra Uq(/hatwidesln+1) to certain quantum cluster algebra via the evaluation module.
5 Regular positive representations
AfterprovingTheorem4.9,wewouldliketodiscussanotherconject ureproposedin[IM22,Section
6]. The ﬁrst author and Man introduced the notion of regular positive representations , which are
positive representations PofUq(g) that are induced from a homomorphism Uq(g)→ Oq(X) to the
regular functions of some cluster variety X, with a suitable polarization of a quantum torus algebra
Oq(Xs) for some seed s.
It was shown in [Ip18], [Ip20] and [IM22] that the following list of irredu cible regular positive
representations is known:
23(1) The standard representation Pλ,
(2) The parabolic representation PJ
λforWJ⊂W,
(3) The degenerate representation P0,J
λforWJ⊂Wof typeAk1×···×Akm,
(4) The modular double P0,J
/tildewideλofP0,J
λ,
(5) A mixture of type (2)-(4) for disconnected subsets of Dynkin indices.
By construction, all these representations stem from the stand ard representation. It is conjec-
tured in [IM22, Section 6] that the above list is complete.
To give some intuition, recall the isomorphism
Uq(g)≃ Oq(LG,⊙)
for simply laced gand conjectured for general g. Based on this isomorphism, it is natural to guess
that all irreducible regular positive representations must come fro m the standard one. However, it
is hard to determine if there are other modiﬁcations we can do to the standard representation, and
generate more irreducible regular positive representations.
Combining Theorem 4.9, we conjecture that for any irreducible regu lar positive representation,
the homomorphisms Uq(g)→ Oq(X) must send the Chevalley generators to universal polynomials.
Even if there are other representations missed by the list, it is inter esting to ask whether universal
polynomiality always hold.
