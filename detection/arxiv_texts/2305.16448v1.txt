This work presents a study on the nonrelativistic quantum motion of a charged particle in a rotating frame,
considering the Aharonov-Bohm effect and a uniform magnetic field. We derive the equation of motion and the
corresponding radial equation to describe the system. The Schrödinger equation with minimal coupling incor-
porates rotation effects by substituting the momentum operator with an effective four-potential. Additionally,
a radial potential term, dependent on the average radius of the ring, is introduced. The analysis is restricted to
motion in a two-dimensional plane, neglecting the degree of freedom in the z-direction. By solving the radial
equation, we determine the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, allowing for an explicit expression of the energy.
The probability distribution is analyzed for varying rotating parameter values, revealing a shift of the distribution
as the rotation changes, resulting in a centrifugal effect and occupation of the ring’s edges. Furthermore, nu-
merical analysis demonstrates the significant rotational effects on energy levels and optical properties, including
optical absorption and refractive coefficients.
I. INTRODUCTION
The behavior of Two-Dimensional Electron Gas (2DEG) in
quantum rings at the mesoscopic scale, under the influence
of specific types of confinement potential, Aharonov-Bohm
potential, and external magnetic fields, has been extensively
investigated. These conditions give rise to various physical
phenomena that affect the electronic properties of the system.
Notably, the Landau levels are modified due to the influence
of a radial potential, leading to an increase in magnetization,
and persistent current [1, 2]. Additionally, quantum rings ex-
hibit non-linear optical properties, as demonstrated through
calculations of the Optical Absorption Coefficients (OACs)
and Refractive Index Changes (RICs). These properties can
be influenced by external magnetic fields, Confinement Po-
tential, and Aharonov-Bohm effect [3–5]. Quantum rings re-
main an active and open field of exploration, attracting signifi-
cant interest and extensive research due to their physical back-
ground and applications. These include the study of effects on
optical properties of cylindrical quantum dots influenced by
temperature and pressure [6], calculation of optical properties
of spherical quantum dots with combined confining potentials
[7], and search of optical properties of quantum disk with az-
imuthal distortion that may be beneficial in designing of op-
toelectronic devices [8]. Applications of quantum rings also
include the utilization of quantum rings in nano-flash memo-
ries [9], photonic devices [10], qubits for spintronic quantum
computing [11, 12], as well as magnetic random access mem-
ory, recording medium, and other spintronic devices [13].

¶Cleverson Filgueiras - cleverson.filgueiras@ufla.brlong history of extensive research. For instance, the Coriolis
force in a rotating frame of reference is known to be analogous
to the Lorentz force on a charged particle due to a magnetic
field [14]. Tsai and Neilson [15] also showed that the quan-
tum interference effect in rotating frames is analogous to the
well-known Aharonov-Bohm effect [16]. Gaining a deeper
comprehension of how rotation influences quantum systems
offers valuable insights into the fundamental behavior of par-
ticles. However, investigating rotational effects in systems
like quantum rings is a recent topic. Analytical investigations
have recently addressed the rotational effects in quantum ring
systems [17, 18]. Furthermore, recent numerical investiga-
tions have showcased notable rotational effects on electronic
states, persistent currents, and magnetization in quantum rings
[19, 20]. Overall, the impact of rotating in the study of quan-
tum rings has interesting implications on energy levels and
the fundamental quantum behavior of the system. Therefore,
studying the spatial distribution of particles and optical prop-
erties of quantum rings under rotational effects is still an open
topic. Future investigations in this topic advance our theoreti-
cal understanding and hold promise for progressing areas such
as quantum optics, optoelectronics, and their applications.
From this standpoint, this work investigates the impact of
rotation on the nonrelativistic quantum motion of a charged
particle within a rotating frame, explicitly considering the
Aharonov-Bohm effect and a uniform magnetic field. In this
study, we derive the equation of motion and the correspond-
ing radial equation to describe the system. The analysis em-
ploys the Schrödinger equation with minimal coupling, where
rotation effects are incorporated by substituting the momen-
tum operator with an effective four-potential. We introduce a
radial potential term that depends on the average radius of a
ring. While not included in this manuscript, the potential un-
der consideration also enables the study of optical properties,
such as conductance measurement [21] and photoionization
cross-section [22]. It is important to note that the present in-
vestigation is limited to two-dimensional motion, neglectingarXiv:2305.16448v1  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  25 May 20232
the degree of freedom in the z-direction. By determining the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, our objective is to unravel the
intricate relationship between rotation and quantum behavior.
The probability distribution is analyzed for various values of
the rotating parameters. Furthermore, we perform numerical
analysis to investigate the rotational effects on energy levels
and optical properties, including optical absorption and re-
fractive coefficients. These are crucial in understanding the
system’s behavior under rotation.
This article is organized as follows: Section II provides an
in-depth analysis of the equation of motion, presenting its so-
lution and introducing the concept of the quantum ring. The
derivation of the equation of motion and its implications for
the system under rotation is discussed in detail. In Section III,
we present the numerical results obtained from the implemen-
tation of rotations and provide a comprehensive discussion of
these results. The effects of rotation on energy levels, optical
properties, and probability distributions are examined, shed-
ding light on the intricate relationship between rotation and
quantum behavior. Finally, in Section IV, we draw conclu-
sions based on our findings and highlight the significance of
the explored rotation effects in quantum mechanics.
II. THE EQUATION OF MOTION
In this section, we study the nonrelativistic quantum mo-
tion of a charged a particle of mass mein a rotating frame
in the presence of both the Aharonov-Bohm effect and uni-
form magnetic field without considering the particle’s spin ef-
fects. We shall obtain the equation of motion and its corre-
sponding radial equation of motion. Subsequently, we must
solve it and determine the particle’s eigenenergies and wave
functions. Evidently, for our purposes, we shall only con-
sider the Schrödinger equation with minimal coupling, which
we follow the model presented in Chapter 17 of Ref. [23].
The rotational and electromagnetic effects are included in the
Schrödinger equation by substituting
pυ→pυ−µAυ

where Aυ

we shall specify below, the effective vector potential Aeleis
given in terms of the Aharonov-Bohm potential and the po-
tential due to a uniform magnetic field in the z-direction, with
∇·Aele=0 and A0

where Ωis the angular velocity. Here, we assume that Ωhas
only the zcomponent so that in cylindrical coordinates, the
coordinate vector reads r=ρˆρ, and consequently, we write
Ω×r=Ωρˆϕ. Furthermore, it is well known in the literature
that the Aharonov-Bohm problem has translational invariance
in the z-direction, so we can exclude the zdegree of freedom
by imposing pz=z=0 [24–26]. Thus, we shall study the
motion of the electron constrained to move only in the plane.
Therefore, we must study the combined effects involving the
rotation Ω, the potentials A1andA2, and the field B2. The
equation of motion to be solved is written as

where ρ0defines the average radius of the ring and also rep-

quantity ω0characterizes the strength of the transverse con-
finement. Besides characterizing an exactly soluble model,
the radial potential (6) describes a localized ring of finite
width, providing a convenient theoretical tool to study elec-
tronic states, as well as their dependence on the magnetic field
in a 2D ring [1, 2].

In this section, we numerically investigate the results ob-
tained in Section II for the case of a 2D quantum ring with
an average radius of ρ0=20 nm and ¯hω0=40 meV . We use
the data collected from a 2D GaAs heterostructure, which can
easily be found in the literature. We complete our analysis
by studying the impact of rotation on the linear and nonlin-
ear optical properties of an electron in a 2D quantum ring.
All calculations were performed using the following physi-
cal parameters [1, 4]: µ=0.067µe, where µe=9.1094×
10−31eV/c2is the electron mass, nr=3.2 is the refractive in-
dex,ε0=8.854×10−12F/m is the permittivity of free space
andc=2.99×108m/sis the speed of light. We have also
considered the specific values: the incident optical intensity
I=40 GW/m2, the relaxation time Γ0=1/0.2ps, the den-
sity of states σν=5.0×1022m−3and the permeability of the
system µ0=4π×10−7T m/A [3, 27].
Using the normalized eigenfunction (10), we can evaluate
the probability distribution of finding the particle in certain
states nandm. This allows us to analyze the system’s behav-
ior and understand its properties. Figure 2 illustrates how the
probability distribution changes with a positive rotating pa-
rameter for the states with ( n=0,m=0) and ( n=2,m=1)
(on the top, we have a 3D visualization of the probability pro-
file). As Ωincreases, the distribution shifts towards lower
values, indicating that the particle is more likely to be found
closer to the inner radius of the ring (inner edge) for higher
rotations. The probability amplitude becomes more concen-
trated with less spacing between adjacent values as Ωin-
creases. Additionally, the eigenfunction occupies the edges of
the ring as mincreases giving rise to a centrifugal effect, with
the particle having greater probability to be find at the outer
edge. For n=2, the amplitude of the third wave peak exceeds
that of the preceding ones as we move along the horizontal
axis. We then observe a symmetrical increase in the ampli-
tudes that were previously decreasing. This phenomenon ap-
pears to occur for all ngreater than or equal to 1. This be-
havior is expected since the potential in equation (6) approx-
imates that of a pure Quantum Harmonic Oscillator [28] for
larger values of ρ(i.e., greater outer radius), see Figure 1.
Similarly to the behavior observed in positive rota-
tions, Figure 3 demonstrates how the probability distribu-
tion changes when negative rotating parameters are applied
to states with ( n=0,m=0) and ( n=2,m=1) (on the top we
have a 3D visualization of the probability profile). As the ro-
tation rate Ωdecreases, the distribution shifts towards higher
values, indicating that the particle is more likely to be found
closer to the outer radius of the ring (outer edge) for lower
rotation rates. The probability amplitude becomes less con-
centrated, with greater spacing between adjacent values as Ω
decreases. As the value of mincreases, the eigenfunctions
tend to occupy the edges of the ring, with greater probability
to be find at the outer edge.
By examining the energy spectrum given by equation (12),
we can see that the electronic states of the system are depen-
dent on the rotation parameter (Figure 4). For the observed
states and range of rotation values considered, we find that4

the energy levels increase with the strength of the rotation. In
the rotation range used in this work, we can see that the en-
ergy of the state (n=0,m=0)can surpass states with larger
quantum numbers as the value of Ωincreases. For instance,
in the range with positive rotations, the lowest energy level
is not (n=0,m=0). In this case, states with higher wave
numbers like (n=2,m=1)has a greater probability closer
to the center of the ring due to the centrifugal effect caused
by the quantum number m. Also, for the quantum ring we are
studying here, the probability distribution of finding the elec-
trons shows that the electrons are more likely to be found at
the edges of the ring instead of being concentrated at the cen-
ter of it (see Figures 2 and 3). This is expected as we consider
various physical parameters in our calculations. However, the
rotating parameter has a significant effect on the energy spec-
trum, as we can see from the states shown in Figure 4. This
rotational dependence on the energy spectrum is an important
system feature and will be further analyzed in the context of
Optical Properties.
By following the References [4, 29], in which the theory
of the OACs and RICs are developed, we present the mathe-
matics of optics necessary for our purposes in this work. In
a two-level system approach with the dipole-allowed optical
transitions being the states ∆m=±1 [30], we choose the en-
ergy levels and the wavefunctions participating in the transi-
tion as:
ψ1=ψ00,ψ2=ψ21,∆E=E21−E00. (14)

Assuming the polarization of the incident radiation along the
in-plane x-axis, the electric dipole transition matrix elements
are
M21=⟨ψ2|ρcosϕ|ψ1⟩, (15)
and considering that the electric dipole selection rules for M11
andM22it will appear in terms ofR2π
0cosϕdϕ=0 (due to the
azimuthal symmetry of the system), hence
M11=M22=0. (16)5

In Figure 5, we numerically calculate the OACs and the
RICs as a function of photon energy for four different values
of the rotation parameter Ω, i.e., Ω=0,Ω=30THz, Ω=
50THz and Ω=80THz. Our calculations focus on the optics
involved in the transition between states with ( n=0,m=0)
and ( n=2,m=1). Figure 5(a) shows the linear, third-order
non-linear, and total optical absorption coefficients as a func-
tion of incident photon energy for varying rotation values.
The linear coefficient dominates, while the third-order coef-
ficient has a small contribution. As the rotation parameter Ω
increases, the resonant peaks (also known as transition fre-
quency) at ¯hω=∆Eshift to higher energies, and the ampli-
tudes of all the OACs decrease. Figure 5(b) shows the linear,
third-order non-linear, and total refractive index for varying
rotation values. The RICs exhibit the same behavior concern-
ing rotation effects as the OACs, with peak positions shifting
to higher energies and resulting in a blue resonance shift in
a two-dimensional quantum ring. The peak intensities of all
RICs decrease as Ωincreases. Notably, the RICs are located
at the resonant peak ¯hω=∆Eof the OACs, as expected. Fur-6
thermore, the influence of the rotating parameter is evident
in Figure 5(a)-(b), where the curves with rotation effects (col-
ored) are separated from those without rotation effects (black).
In Figure 6, we also present numerical calculations of the
OACs and the RICs as a function of photon energy for the
transition between states with ( n=0,m=0) and ( n=2,m=
1). Here, the calculations are performed for four different val-
ues of the rotation parameters, including negative rotations:
Ω=0,Ω=−20 THz, Ω=−25 THz, and Ω=−30 THz.
The Figure 6 reveals a similar trend to what was observed in
Figure 5. However, it is evident that as the rotation parameters
decrease (negative rotations), the effects of non-linear optics
become more pronounced (see the third-order non-linear co-
efficients (dotted line) in Figure 6).
IV . CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have investigated the nonrelativistic quan-
tum motion of a charged particle in a 2D quantum ring un-
der the influence of rotation. By deriving the equation of
motion using the minimal coupling procedure and consider-
ing the Aharonov-Bohm effect and a uniform magnetic field,
we obtained the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, providing in-
sights into the energy levels and spatial distribution of the par-
ticle. Our analysis of the probability distribution revealed a
distinct shift towards lower values along the radial coordinate
as the rotation increased. This shift indicates a higher likeli-
hood of finding the particle closer to the inner and outer radii
(edges) of the system rather than in the average region ρ0.
These results are consistent with the observed occupation of
electrons at the system’s edges, emphasizing the singular de-
pendence of electronic states on the rotation parameter. Fur-
thermore, we examined the optical properties of the system,
including optical absorption and refractive coefficients. Ourfindings demonstrated that rotational effects have a significant
impact on the system’s behavior. In both cases, we observed
a shift towards higher values of the resonant energy peak, ac-
companied by a decrease in the amplitude of the peaks with in-
creasing rotational effects. The insights gained from this study
deepen our understanding of the intricate relationship between
the rotation and quantum behavior in quantum rings. The ob-
served concentration of electrons at the system’s edges and the
significant rotational effects on optical properties may con-
tribute to the development of quantum optics, optoelectronics,
and related technologies. The investigations presented in this
work provide valuable insights into the behavior of charged
particles in rotating quantum ring systems, shedding light on
the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics and opening
avenues for further exploration.
To conclude, we would like to emphasize that our analysis
considers significant rotational effects, typically on the scale
of several terahertz (THz). These high rotation rates are neces-
sary to achieve compelling visualizations of the rotational ef-
fects, as discussed in [20], when compared to scenarios where
rotations are absent. However, it is worth noting that in quan-
tum systems such as 2D quantum rings, rotational effects exist
even at much lower rotation rates.
