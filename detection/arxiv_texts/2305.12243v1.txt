Abstract  
Diamond single crystals showing Infra -red features of pressurized CO 2-I phase were 
studied using T ransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and tomography. Numerous O -
containing precipitates with sizes up to 45 nm are observed. The absolute majority of these 
precipitates decorate dislocation loops or are located inside them; individual scattered 
precipitates are also present. Morphology of the precipitates varies from qu asi-isometric 
octahedra to highly flattened elongated ones. Close association of the precipitates with the  
dislocation  loops implies their formation by exsolution of oxygen impurity from diamond lattice ; 
the size distribution of the precipitates suggests t hat the equilibrium state is not yet reached . 
Presumably, the morphology and precise chemical composition depend on P -T-t evolution of the 
diamond crystal and corresponding changes in oxygen supersaturation in the lattice. The CO 2-containing diamonds often  contain micron -sized hexagonal lamellar inclusions.  TEM 
investigation of a lamellae reveals that it consists of high quality graphite  showing partial 
epitaxial relation with comprising diamond . The gap between the graphite and diamond may be 
enriched with  oxygen impurity.  
Keywords: diamond; oxygen nanoprecipitate, impurity exsolution, CO 2 inclusion  
 
1. Introduction  
Despite years of research, existence  of oxygen as a lattice impurity in diamond remains 
debatable . Since early analyses using m ass spectrometry  [1] and nuclear probes [2,3] , presence 
of oxygen was established in several  diamond samples in concentrations up to 1000 at.ppm. 
However, since oxygen is an important constituent of most minerals and fluids , contribution of 
corresponding inclusions , possi bly nanosized,  is extremely difficult to rule out  in these analytical 
methods . Computational studies [4-6] suggest that oxygen may form point defects in diamond 
lattice  and spectroscop y provide s some support for this hypothesis . Obviously o xygen ions may 
be driven into diamond lattice by ion implantation . Small amount s of luminescent [7], 
paramagnetic [8] and, possibly, electrically active  [9] O-related defects  were formed during post -
irradiation annealing . For the purpose of the present  work, it is more im portant to consider 
incorporation of O ions during diamond growth  or during plasma treatment . Oxygen is believed 
to enter defects responsible for an optical absorption band with a peak at 480 nm [1 0], a peak at 
1060 cm-1 in infra -red ( IR) [11,12 ], the 566 nm luminescence band [1 2] and several 
cathodoluminescence features [13,14]; paramagnetic defects  are also ascribed to this impurity 
[5,15,16] . Despite all these studies, behavior of oxygen in diamond lattice is highly controversial 
and poorly understood .  
Infra -red spectra of some natural diamond single crystals reveal absorption bands by CO 2 
entities  [17,18 ]. Significant variations in shape and position of corresponding spectral features 
both between samples  and, sometimes, even within individual crystals were reported [ 10,18]. 
Recent detailed study revealed that the changes in the CO 2 spectral features  across individual 
samples follow regular patterns  [19]. It was suggested that the observations are explained by 
gradual changes in shape and/or chemical composition of nanosized CO 2-based  inclusions , 
presumably, trapped during diamond growth . In the current study, we extend the work [ 19] by 
Transmission Electron Microscopy investigation of samples extracted from different parts of the CO 2-containing diamond single crystals. The results of this work show that in the studied 
samples the CO 2-containing  inclusions do not result f rom entrapment of a growth medium, 
instead, they were likely formed by decay of supersaturated solid solution of oxygen in diamond 
lattic e. In addition, we report results of investigation of unusual type of graphitic inclusions 
encountered in these samples  and rather common for CO 2-containing diamonds in general .  
 
 2. Materials and methods  
 Two natural diamond single crystals (FN7112 and F N7114) with strong CO 2-related 
bands in IR spectra were studied. The samples are described in detail in [19]. In short, they 
represent double -sided plates cut from gems and were treated at 6 GPa and 2100 °C for 10 
minutes; the treatment did not influence t he color and CO 2-related infra -red bands  [10]. Despite 
being a single crystal, the sample FN7114 comprises two parts with markedly different 
coloration  (“dark” and “ transparent ”, see Fig. 1a ); this zoning is also obvious in IR spectra. 
Using focused  Ga+ ion beam (FIB) thin foils were extracted from the “dark” and “transparent” 
parts of the specimen. Microstructural analyses of the FIB foils was performed using  an OSIRIS 
TEM/STEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) equipped with a high angle annular (HAADF) 
electron detector (Fischione, USA) and Bruker energy -dispersive X -ray microanalysis system 
(Bruker, USA) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Image processing was performed using a 
Digital Micrograph (Gatan, USA) and TIA (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) softwar e.  
Both foils from the FN7114 specimen were also studied using TEM tomography to get 
information about 3D morphology of the precipitates. 10 nm g old nanoparticles  (Colloidal Gold 
Labeled Protein A, UMC Utrecht, Netherlands) were used as fiducial markers f or the alignment 
of tilt -series projection images. A 3 µL droplet of the suspension was applied on one side of the 
microscope grid, and then blotted to remove excess liquid and allowed to air dry.  The 
tomographic study was carried out with a Titan Krios 60 –300 TEM/STEM (FEI), equipped with 
TEM direct electron detector Falcon II (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and Cs image corrector 
(CEOS, Heidelberg, Germany), at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Datasets were collected 
automatically with Tomography4 (Ther mo Fisher Scientific, USA) software with 18000 × 
magnification  with the defocus value around – 0.5 μm by tilting the specimen within the −60° to 
60° range with 1° step. Cross -correlation alignment and tomography restoration were perf ormed using IMOD software  [20] by weighte d back -projection (WBP) method. Final visualization was 
made  with UCSF Chimera [21] and IMOD.  Note that tomographic reconstructions of the 
smallest precipitates is complicated by contribution of stress fields from dislocation loops and 
the selected threshold value is somewhat arbitrary.  
An interesting feature of the studied diamond FN7112 is the presence of abundant small 
plate -like inclusions visible in optical microscope and special care was applied to extract an 
additional TEM foil containing such inclusion. Although the total number of the inclusions in the 
specimen is high, it is v ery difficult to find them in a thin (few microns) subsurface layer 
accessible for FIB  sampling . The search for a suitable location was made using 3D optical 
microscope Keyence VHX -1000, which permits to make high quality images from a given depth 
in the s ample. Scanning Electron microscopy  showed that the inclusions exposed to the surface 
look like a thin crack. Upon examination of the polished diamond surface around the cracks,  
related band s with a negative surface relief may be traced, indicating that di amond was more 
efficiently removed by the polishing procedure immediately after the inclusion opening. The FIB 
foil was oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the platelet.  
 
3. Results  
 3.1. Oxygen -containing precipitates  
Numerous nanosized inclusions we re observed in the TEM foils. Their s hape s and 
localization differ both between the samples and even in different parts of FN7114 diamond , 
where optically dark and bright parts are present ( Fig. 1A). 
 In the optically dark part of the sample  FN7114 , as wel l as in the sample FN7112 , 
numerous dislocation loops 50-100 nm in diameter  are observed  (Fig. 1) . Many loops are 
decorated by precipitates  (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Movies 3,4) . The precipitates are also 
encountered inside the dislocation loops or may be present as scattered individual entities. In 
some cases a loop is not immediately obvious, but rather dense localization of the precipitates 
(e.g., in the upper right part of the Fig. 1 C) likely indicate that the loop was initially present. 
Tomography rule s out a hypothesis that the scattered “individual” inclusions are associated with loops oriented perpendicularly the observation plane in TEM images ( Fig. 1H,  Supplementary 
Fig. S1 and Movie SM1).  
The tomographic slices shows rather wide scatter in shapes  of the precipitates, which 
vary between almost perfect octahedra to elongated ones  (Fig. 1  and Supplementary Movie 2),. 
The size distribution of the precipitates is shown in Fig. 1H and was calculated as (a+b)/2, where 
a, b – distances between the opposit e (111) faces of a precipitate as observed in bright field TEM 
images (e.g., Fig. 1 C). The error in the inferred size is mostly defined by uncertainty in 
determination of the precipitate edges in cases where strain -related contrast  is sufficiently strong  
to blur the image. The overall uncertainty of the size is estimated as ~2 nm. Note that extraction 
of the size distribution from the tomographic images would gave much larger statistics, but the 
contrast issues definitely limits the precision, making the si ze determination more subjective. 
Most scattered “individual” precipitates are 7 -10 nm in size ; those associated with the dislocation 
loops are somewhat larger : the majority are between 7 and 15 nm. Diagonals of t he largest 
precipitates reach 45 nm.  
Appea rance of the precipitates resemble N -containing voidites  known in natural 
diamonds subjected to prolonged annealing. Voidites are often located within dislocation loops 
resulting from decomposition of platelet defects (e.g., [2 2,23]), or, in some diamonds,  are 
unrelated to dislocations [2 4]. IR spectroscopy reveals low N content and absence of platelets in 
this part of the FN7114 specimen ([1 9], see also Fig s. 1B and 3 ). Chemical mapping shows that 
the inclusions contain oxygen whereas nitrogen is not detec ted (Fig. 1M -O). In combination with 
infra -red spectroscopy data we consider the TEM observations as a strong support of a CO 2-
based nature of the inclusions.  In all cases the filling of the precipitates appears to be either 
amorphous or, possibly, poorly crystalline, since no hints for diffraction spots were found.

of the precipitates on th e loops. K, L - tomographic slices of individual precipitates with various 
elongation. M-O – HAADF image and maps of N and O distribution in a domain with the 
precipitates.  Another TEM foil was extracted from the optically bright transparent part of the di amond 
specimen (Fig. 2). Infra -red spectra of the corresponding location (Fig. 1D) indicate presence of 
N-containing platelet defects. Their peak is  at 1365 cm-1, corresponding to sizes ~ 40 nm [25]. 
Although complexity of one -phonon region of this crystal precludes detailed analysis, the 
presence of the platelets and of the B -defects suggest that the diamond is “regular” in Woods’ 
classification [26] and N -related voidites are not expected  to be present in substantial amounts . 
No platelets were observed in our TEM images, reflecting their low overall concentration. In this 
foil morphology of t he CO 2-related inclusions markedly differ from those described above , see 
Fig. 2. The dislocation loops are present, but the main fraction of the decorating precipitate s are 
not (quasi)isometric . Instead, most of them are represented by highly elongated and flattened  
octahedra with t he long axis reaching 40-45 nm  and with 4-8 nm smaller axes ; size distribution 
of the precipitates is shown in Fig. 2G -I. The conclusions ma de from analysis of 2D images  are 
fully supported by electron tomography  (Fig. 2 J,K, Supplementary Movies 5 -7). Whereas 
chemical mapping in the foil from the optically dark part of the diamond (see above) showed 
clear correlation of the precipitates with o xygen impurity, in the “ transparent ” part of the 
specimen the concentration of this impurity is lower. Nevertheless, EDX line scans across the 
dislocation loops show presence of oxygen and absence of N (Fig. 2 E,F).  
Two foils were also extracted from the s econd diamond, FN7112. Whereas the principal 
attention was directed towards planar inclusions  (see below), the O -related precipitates were also 
studied. Their morphology is generally close to isometric octahedra, although the elongated ones 
are also presen t (Fig. 1D -F).  
The CO 2-related IR bands  often show large variations in spectral envelope [10,18,19]. To 
explain these observations,  two main hypotheses were proposed  [19]: influence of a chemical 
impurity  in the CO 2 ice and dependence of the envelope on m orphology and internal structure 
(for example, core-shell) of the CO 2 ice nanoparticles. Comparison of IR spectra of regions 
analyse d by TEM in both diamonds  (Fig. 3)  shows absence of obvious correlation between the 
CO 2-related IR absorption bands and morp hology of the precipitates. Consequently, the scatter in 
IR manifestations of the CO 2 are more likely explained by the presence of a chemical impurity  
such as  water, nitrogen  or oxygen .

contribution of diamond lattice  absorption is subtracted to highlight the CO 2-bands; main 
components are shown (see also [1 9]). Dotted line is a linear background.  
 
3.2. Graphite platelets  
A remarkable feature of the studied samples and of CO 2-diamonds in general is the 
presence of smal l (5-10 µm) black (quasi)hexagonal inclusions with thickness below resolution 
of an optical microscope, i.e. less than ~0.5 µm [ 27,28]. Some of these inclusions apparently 
consist  of several parallel hexagons (see Fig. 4A). Analysis of crystallographic rel ationships of 
the inclusions with the diamond matrix lead Lang and coauthors  [27] to suggestion that the 
lamellas are graphitic. In the same time, our repeated attempts to detect Raman spectrum  from 
the lamellae  using various excitation wavelengths in conf ocal mode or to observe their X-ray 
diffraction pattern failed to identify the phase(s) present in the inclusions.   
The TEM image of the FIB foil containing the lamellae in shown in Fig. 4. Electron 
diffraction and direct imaging of interlayer spacing indi cate that the lamellae is indeed pure 
graphite  (Fig. 4 G,H) , comprising at least two parallel subdomains. Mottled contrast in some 
regions and streaks between the diffraction spots indicate  disorder . The crystallographic 
orientation of the graphite -diamond  is close to G[001] -D[111]. The contact between the graphitic 
sheet and the diamond matrix differs between the “upper” and “bottom” parts of the lamellae as 
shown in Fig. 4C-F. In the bottom part, the contact was likely (quasi)epitaxial . As discussed in 
detail in [29]  the misfit in the interface G(001)/D(111) is only ~2% at normal conditions . The 
mismatch strain caused slight undulation of the graphite manifested as regular detachments between the two phases. In the upper part, the graphite lamellae is sepa rated from the diamond 
matrix by a ~10 nm gap. Chemical mapping reveals presence of oxygen in the gap  (Fig. 4I -L). It 
is unlikely to be a n atmospheric contamination, since if this would be the case , oxygen would be 
present in many other spots, for example,  at the contact of the graphitic lamellae with the 
diamond surface exposed by mechanical polishing (upper right  corner of the image). Moreover, 
such a contamination should contain nitrogen, which is not observed. In our view , the oxygen 
precipitation in the gap may be one of the reasons for partial local graphitization of diamond  or 
its consequence , see Discussion.

4. Discussion.  
4.1. Formation of the oxygen -containing precipitates  
Disloca tion loops are not very common in as-grown diamond. Degradation of the N-
containing platelets occur ring due to insufficiently  understood reasons is, perhaps, a most 
common process producing the loops in natural diamond . The former platelets are often marke d 
by dislocation loops, frequently  surroundung  abundant nanosized precipitates of relatively low 
electronic density , called  voidites. The v oidites contain N- or N-H species, presumably inherited 
from the parent platelets ; exact composition and degree of cr ystallinity appears to be sample -
dependent . Sometimes voidites are strongly elongated  [22], similar  to precipitates in the 
transparent  part of FN7114 (Fig.  2). As discussed above, the precipitates observed by us are 
generally larger  than the voidites , cont ain oxygen instead of nitrogen and, in most cases, are 
directly attached to a dislocation  loop rather than being dispersed inside. The precipitates are also 
unrelated to the N-containing platelets .  
Inclusions of trapped CO 2 with sizes reaching several mic rons in size are known in 
natural [17, 18, 31-33] diamonds as well as in some synthetic single crystals [12]. There is little 
doubt that such inclusions were trapped during diamond growth or fill healed cracks. We suggest 
that the precipitates observed by us were formed by fundamentally differ ent mechanism:  
exsolution of oxygen impurity present in diamond lattice . The f ormation of nanosized impurity 
precipitates decorating dislocation loops is a common phenomenon in supersaturated solid 
solutions (e.g., in heavily doped semiconductors) and in irradiated materials. Upon cooling, 
concentration of intrinsic and /or extrinsic defects may exceed respective solubility limit s and 
thus precipitation of impurit ies and/or vacancies occurs. In these  instances , formation  of 
dislocation loops is a result of agglomeration of excess vacancies  or interstitials . The loops can 
also be generated by a precipitate  itself to decrease mechanical stresses, but in this situation , 
undecorated nested loops are commonly formed .  
In our v iew, the only feasible explanation of all observations of  the O-rich precipitates 
decorating dislocation loops is the decay of supersaturated solid solution of oxygen in diamond 
lattice. This hypothesis explicitly implies presence of an oxygen impurity in as-grown diamond. 
In silicon – a material with diamond lattice – the morphology of the SiO x precipitates depends both on exact precipitate composition and on supersaturation of oxygen in silicon lattice . Based 
on experimental observations and conception of  equilibrium growth morphology, it was 
suggested that the SiO x precipitates form platelets at low temperatures and high supersaturations, 
and octahedra at high T’s and low supersaturation s [34]. Exact chemical composition, degree of 
crystallinity and inter nal structure of the precipitates also depend on temperature and on 
properties (impurities, type of conductivity, etc.) of the silicon sample. Similar trends could be 
expected for oxygen in diamond.  Thermal history of the diamond sample FN7114 obtained fro m 
IR-active defects indicates that the dark part of the sample grew at lower temperatures, than the 
bright one. This scenario fits well the transition from the (roughly) octahedral CO 2 precipitates to 
platelets -like: the latter ones form in the cooler envi ronments .  
 According to theory of precipitate formation in solid solution s [35], the asymptotic  
(reduced ) size distribution of the precipitates does not depend  on initial state of the system and a 
limiting value of a reduced size should be reached. Althou gh it is possible that we underestimate 
population of the smallest precipitates, the overall shape of the size distribution (Figs. 1G and 
2G) function clearly shows a pronounced tail towards larger precipitates. Assuming applicability 
of the model from [3 5], we conclude that the process of oxygen precipitation from diamond 
lattice has not yet reached a steady state. The presence of rare large precipitates may reflect 
interaction between them, which is especially plausible in view of high density of the prec ipitates 
decorating the loops.   
Although total concentration of oxygen and nitrogen  in diamond  may be correlated [36], 
spectroscopically -active nitrogen is always anti -correlated with the IR-observable CO 2 [10,19] . 
Since the amount of the nitrogen and hydr ogen impurities and their speciation change across the 
diamond specimen FN7114, it is plausible that exact chemical composition of the precipitates 
may vary both in different  parts of heterogeneous diamonds (e.g., in dark and transparent  parts of 
FN7114) a nd between individual samples. This hypothesis is supported by comparison of the 
TEM and IR data, see Fig. 3.  
 The formation of the CO 2-based precipitates by the exsolution of oxygen from diamond 
lattice has important implications for reconstruction of P -T history of a diamond specimen from 
pressure -induced shift s of IR or Raman bands. As discussed in [19], the observed evolution of 
the inferred residual pressure across diamond samples clearly indicate that the shift of spectr al lines is not always confined  to the pressure effects; morphology and exact chemical composition 
of the precipitates may also contribute with different signs. The current work adds another 
important parameter: if the precipitate s were formed by the exsolution of impurity atoms, their 
composition, structure and morphology and, consequently, apparent shift of the spectral lines , 
depend on solubility and speciation of the relevant impurity in the crystalline lattice. These 
factors, in turn, depend on large number of poorly constrained par ameters related to diamond 
growth medium composition and P -T-fO2 conditions. As an extreme example, one may recall 
high residual pressures observed in crystalline precipitates of noble gases produced in ion-
implanted materials, which were always kept at am bient pressure  (e.g., [37]). Similar to the 
formation of CO 2-precipi tates studies by us, v oidites in diamond are produced by exsolution of 
excess N from the diamond lattice. Consequently, the shifts of N 2 [38] and CO 2-related 
IR/Raman bands as well observa tion of compression of the lattice fringes [39] in these 
precipitates are not necessarily applicable to depth of formation of comprising diamonds.  
 The CO 2-diamonds possess number of absorption bands in one -phonon region of IR 
spectra [10] , Fig. 3 . Whereas  some of them are associated with silicates and carbonates (see 
maps in [19]), the bands peaked at ~980 -990, 1050 -1060, 1120 -1140, ~1240, ~1300 cm-1 remain 
unassigned. In all spectra of these diamonds, a sharp peak at diamond Raman frequency of 1332 
cm-1 is present. Its importance stems from the fact that local perturbation of diamond symmetry 
is a prerequisite of its appearance in the IR spectrum  [40]. Whereas the assignment of these 
bands to a particular defect (s) is impossible at present, we tentatively suggest that the reported 
absorptions might be related to oxygen -related defect (s) in the diamond lattice.  
 
4.2. Graphite platelets  
A remarkable feature of substantial number  of CO 2-containing diamonds is the presence 
of tiny graphite lamellae in the cryst al bulk . The concentration of these defects varies widely : 
whereas in the FN7112 they are filling the main fraction of the sample volume, in FN7114 they 
form very small scattered clusters (Fig. 4A,B) . Based on  a comprehensive review by 
Khokhraykov and Nech aev [41], we classify the inclusions as syngenetic. Although both studied 
crystals were HPHT annealed in the diamond stability field, no changes in visual appearance 
and/or spectroscopic features were observed. Moreover, the graphitic lamellae may be abund ant even in untreated natural diamonds  [27,28] . Consequently, their formation suggests growth of 
such crystals close to the diamond -graphite equilibrium line. As suggested in [42], heating of a 
mineral inclusion in diamond may lead not only to local cracki ng of the diamond due to 
differences in thermal expansion  coefficient s, but also may release some oxygen . This gas may, 
in turn,  promote graphitization of the crack surfaces.  In the case of the CO 2 diamonds , mineral 
inclusions are few. High magnification o ptical microscopy  shows absence of a correlation 
between spatial distribution of  the graphitic lamellae and the inclusions. In the studied sample  
FN7112 , the gap between the graphite  lamellae  and the diamond matrix show s enrichment in 
oxygen. In close vici nity to the lamellae  abundant O -containing nanosized precipitates are 
present . This coexistence suggests that formation of the sp2-C phase and the precipitates were 
independent processes, but the gap may  have  trapped some of the diffusing oxygen atoms.  
 
5. Conclusions  
 Transmission electron microscopy of diamond singe crystals manifesting strong CO 2-
related absorption in IR spectra reveals presence of numerous O -rich nanosized precipitates; 
often associated with dislocation loops. Joint consideration of th e current TEM results and 
detailed IR study [19] strongly suggest a direct link between the CO 2-related IR features and the 
precipitates. It is highly likely that both the O - and N -containing nanoprecipitates, the later 
known as voidites, were formed by a common mechanism: exsolution of oxygen (nitrogen) 
impurity from the diamond lattice.  Variations of morphology of the precipitates – plate -like or 
octahedral - is likely governed by temperature of their formation. This model explicitly implies 
that in some diamonds oxygen impurity enters lattice sites. However, their spectral identification, 
if any, remains elusive.  
The driving force for nucleation and subsequent growth of the precipitates is determined 
by difference between the impurity incorporation rate d uring crystal growth and its equilibrium 
solubility at given thermodynamic conditions. Both of these parameters depend on large number 
of parameters. Consequently,  in the case of the  CO 2-precipitates as well as in case of N -related 
voidites, the shift of s pectral IR/Raman lines cannot be used for reconstruction of pressure of the 
diamond formation.    Detailed investigation of dark hexagonal plates common for CO 2-diamonds 
unambiguously proves their assignment to very thin graphite lamellae , most likely, of s yngenetic 
origin . The gap between the graphite and enclosing diamond may contain oxygen impurity . 
However, at present it is unclear, whether this correlation is of  genetic significance or is a 
coincidence .
