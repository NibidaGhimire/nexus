Abstract The decay of sunspot plays a key role in magnetic ﬂux transpor tation in solar
active regions (ARs). To better understand the physical mec hanism of the entire decay process
of a sunspot, an α-conﬁguration sunspot in AR NOAA 12411 was studied. Based on the
continuum intensity images and vector magnetic ﬁeld data wi th stray light correction from
SDO/HMI, the area, vector magnetic ﬁeld and magnetic ﬂux in t he umbra and penumbra are
calculated with time, respectively. Our main results are as follows: (1) The decay curves of the
sunspot area in its umbra, penumbra, and whole sunspot take a ppearance of Gaussian proﬁles.
The area decay rates of the umbra, penumbra and whole sunspot are -1.56 MSH day−1, -
12.61MSH day−1and -14.04 MSH day−1, respectively; (2) With the decay of the sunspot,
the total magnetic ﬁeld strength and the vertical component of the penumbra increase, and the
magnetic ﬁeld of the penumbra becomes more vertical. Meanwh ile, the total magnetic ﬁeld
strength and vertical magnetic ﬁeld strength for the umbra d ecrease, and the inclination angle
changes slightly with an average value of about 20 degrees; ( 3) The magnetic ﬂux decay
curves of the sunspot in its umbra, penumbra, and whole sunsp ot exhibit quadratic patterns,
their magnetic ﬂux decay rates of the umbra, penumbra and who le sunspot are −9.84×
1019Mx day−1,−1.59×1020Mx day−1and−2.60×1020Mx day−1, respectively. The
observation suggests that the penumbra may be transformed i nto the umbra, resulting in the
increase of the average vertical magnetic ﬁeld strength and the reduction of the inclination
angle in the penumbra during the decay of the sunspot.

1 INTRODUCTION
The decay of sunspot plays an important role in the magnetic ﬁ eld evolution of the active region (AR,
Wallenhorst & Howard 1982 ;Wallenhorst & Topka 1982 ) and the magnetic ﬂux transportation on the so-
lar surface ( DeV ore et al. 1984 ;Wang et al. 2002 ). It also affects the solar radiation ( Willson et al. 1981 ;
Lean 2013 ). Thus, it is a hot topic of solar physics. Many early studys m ainly studied the sunspot area de-
cay law based on sunspot catalogs (e.g. Greenwich Photoheli ographic Results and Mount Wilson sunspot
data), and rarely included the decay law of the sunspot magne tic ﬁeld ( Howard 1992 ;Lustig & Wohl 1995 ;
Javaraiah 2011 ,2012 ). With the development of the observation equipment and spe ctral inversion technol-
ogy, the magnetic ﬁeld on the Sun’s surface can be measured mo re precisely. Therefore, the decay laws
of sunspots have been widely studied ( Norton et al. 2017 ;Benko et al. 2018 ;Verma et al. 2018 ;Li et al.
2021 ). However, the evolution of sunspot from its peak period to d isappearance is rarely reported, and the
sunspot decay mechanism has not been well understood.
The area decay is an important aspect for a decaying sunspot. The decay law of the sunspot area is
generally considered to be linear ( Chapman et al. 2003 ;Li et al. 2021 ), while several observations indicate
that it is quadratic ( Petrovay & van Driel-Gesztelyi 1997 ;Litvinenko & Wheatland 2015 ).Li et al. (2021 )
studied the decay of eight α-conﬁguration sunspots, and discovered that the area decay ofα-conﬁguration
sunspots could be approximately linear, and the decay rate w as not a constant. Benko et al. (2021 ) obtained
a linear decay law for the area of umbra and a quadratic decay l aw for the penumbra respectively by an-
alyzing the evolution of a decaying sunspot. Solanki (2003 ) proposed that over 90% of decaying sunspots
showed a linear decrease in area. A parabolic decay law was di scovered by Litvinenko & Wheatland (2015 ),
and was supported by the research of Petrovay & Moreno-Insertis (1997 ). Many studies show that different
decay laws may correspond to different decay mechanisms ( Meyer et al. 1974 ;Krause & Ruediger 1975 ;
Petrovay & Moreno-Insertis 1997 ;Litvinenko & Wheatland 2015 ;Xue et al. 2021 ). The Umbra-Penumbra
area ratio (U/P) of sunspot is also an important parameter du ring the decay of sunspot, which is tightly
correlated with the magnetic ﬁeld ( Jin et al. 2006 ).Hoyt & Schatten (1998 ) suggested that the higher U/P
value means the higher convective velocity and faster sunsp ot decays, since the convective velocity is pro-
portional to the sunspot decay. Chapman et al. (2003 ) also discovered that the total area of sunspots and the
U/P value are strongly correlated to the sunspot decay rate. Martinez Pillet et al. (1993a ) concluded that the
U/P value is nearly a constant.
The magnetic ﬁeld is an important parameter for the sunspot d ecay. Many researches have shown
that the magnetic ﬁeld of the penumbra becomes more vertical at the beginning of the sunspot decay
(Watanabe et al. 2014 ;Bellot Rubio et al. 2008 ). By studying the rapid decay of a penumbra after solar
ﬂares, Wang et al. (2004 ) discovered that the magnetic ﬁeld in the sunspot inclined t o be more vertical,
and a part of penumbral magnetic ﬁeld tend to convert into the umbral magnetic ﬁeld. Verma et al. (2018 )
studied the decay process of AR NOAA 12597 and found that, a da rk region ﬁlled with umbra dots was
observed in the penumbral ﬁlaments. The velocity and magnet ic properties of this dark region were sim-
ilar to those of the umbra, and the magnetic ﬁeld of the penumb ra became more vertical. Jurˇ c´ ak (2011 )
selected the inner penumbra boundaries of 10 sunspots, and p roved that the vertical magnetic ﬁeld of the
inner penumbra boundary was a constant. And then, Jurˇ c´ ak et al. (2018 ) reinforced this conclusion, andThe evolution of a decaying sunspot 3
found that this constant value was almost 1867 G by analyzing 88 scans of 79 active regions observed
with spectropolarimeter on board the Hinode satellite. Schmassmann et al. (2018 ) also supported the con-
clusion of Jurˇ c´ ak (2011 ) by analyzing vector magnetic ﬁeld data for Active Region (A R) NOAA 11591
from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Schou et al. 2012 ) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO, Scherrer et al. 2012 ), but the constant was considered to be 1693 G. Whereas, Benko et al. (2018 )
discovered that the vertical magnetic ﬁeld of the inner penu mbra boundary of a decaying sunspot tended to
decrease during the ﬁrst 4 days and increases again during th e last stages of the decay.
It is a common knowledge that the change of the magnetic ﬂux ac ts a signiﬁcant role in the decay
process of sunspots. In general, the magnetic ﬂux of decayin g sunspots decreases linearly ( Verma et al.
2012 ;Rempel 2015 ).Li et al. (2021 ) suggested that the magnetic ﬂux of α-conﬁguration sunspots decrease
linearly based on vector magnetic ﬁeld data observed by SDO/ HMI. And their decay rates are between
−1.4×1020Mxday−1and−4.9×1020Mxday−1.Sheeley et al. (2017 ) studied the magnetic ﬂux decay
of 36 sunspots, and found that the magnetic ﬂux of some sunspo ts decreases linearly. Their decay rates
are2∼4×1020Mx day−1. Some studies have shown that the emergence of the magnetic ﬂ ux around
sunspots has an important inﬂuence on the formation ( Schlichenmaier et al. 2010 ;Rezaei et al. 2012 ) and
decay ( Verma et al. 2018 ) of the penumbra. Additionally, the moving magnetic featur es (MMFs) are usually
observed in the vicinity of decaying sunspots, and it transp orted magnetic ﬂux to surrounding network
during the sunspot decay ( Verma et al. 2012 ;Deng et al. 2007 ).
To better understand the whole decay mechanism of sunspots, the evolution of an α-conﬁguration
sunspot is studied in this paper. Observations and Methods a re described in section 2. In section 3, the
results of the sunspot decay are analyzed. At the end, conclu sions and discussion are shown in section 4.
2 OBSERV ATIONS AND METHODS
The basic information on the decay process of an α-type sunspot is listed in the Table 1, which includes the
AR number of the sunspot, beginning and ending time of the cho sen data, and the position of the sunspot,
respectively.

The analysis is based on the data observed with SDO/HMI. The h mi.sharp cea720s data is a se-
ries of Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) dat a taken by SDO/HMI. Its temporal ca-
dence and pixel scale are 720s and 0.5”, respectively ( Bobra et al. 2014 ;Hoeksema et al. 2014 ). The
hmi.sharp cea720s dconS data is based on the hmi.sharp cea720s data with stray light correction1.
The temporal cadence and pixel scale of the hmi.sharp cea720s dconS data are the same as that of
the hmi.sharp cea720s data. The continuum intensity images and vector magnet ic ﬁeld data from the
hmi.sharp cea720s dconS data are selected to study the decay process of the suns pot. The temporal ca-
dence of the selected data is set to be 1 hour. The vector magne tic ﬁeld data are obtained by inversion
14 Y . Peng et al.
from six sample points on the Fe I 6173.3 ˚A spectral line. The vector magnetic ﬁeld data consists of th ree
components, namely, BR,BP,BT. TheBP,BT,BRrepresent φ(westward) component of the Cylindrical
Equal-Area (CEA) projection vector magnetic ﬁeld in the dir ection of solar rotation, θ(southward) compo-
nent of the CEA vector magnetic ﬁeld, radial (out of photosph ere) component of the CEA vector magnetic
ﬁeld, respectively ( Hoeksema et al. 2014 ).
The umbra and penumbra of the sunspot on the photosphere are d etermined through the following
process: First, an average continuum intensity of the solar quiet region around the sunspot is calculated as I0.
Next, the intensities of continuum images are normalized by I0. The umbra and penumbra are determined
according to following two criteria respectively: Iumbra/lessorequalslant0.55I0and0.55I0< Ipenumbra /lessorequalslant0.94I0,
whereIumbra andIpenumbra are continuum intensity values of the umbra and penumbra, re spectively. The
identiﬁcation method of the inner and outer boundaries of th e penumbra is similar to that of Li et al. (2021 ),
and the threshold is ﬁne-tuned to adapt better to the inner an d outer boundaries of the penumbra on the
continuum intensity images. Once more, the region grow meth od is used to determine the penumbra region.
Finally, the hole ﬁlling method is used to remove the wrong id entiﬁcation region in the penumbra. Fig. 1
shows the identiﬁcation boundaries of the inner (the red cur ves) and outer (the green curves) boundaries of
the penumbra in continuum images based on the above process.

3 RESULTS
The decay process of the α-type sunspot is shown in Fig. 1. The continuum intensity, total magnetic ﬁeld
strength, horizontal and vertical magnetic ﬁeld strength, the inclination angle maps are displayed in Fig.
1from the top row to the bottom row. The polarity of the sunspot is negative. In the early stage of the
sunspot decay, it owns an annular penumbra, a bright bridge g radually forms in the umbra (see panel a2),
and the vertical magnetic ﬁeld strength map (panel d2) show t he vertical magnetic ﬁeld of the bright bridge
is weaker than that of the umbra. A lot of Moving Magnetic Feat ures (MMFs) are seen around the sunspot in
magnetic ﬁeld strength maps. From the vertical magnetic ﬁel d strength maps, a large number of MMFs come
out of the sunspot. A part of a network gradually presents in p anel d3. In the end, there is an obvious network
around the sunspot (see panel d4). Some studies suggested th at MMFs transported the magnetic ﬂux of
decaying sunspots to the surrounding network ( Deng et al. 2007 ;Verma et al. 2012 ), and they are carried
out of the decaying sunspot by moat ﬂow ( Harvey & Harvey 1973 ). With the evolution of the sunspot, the
average transverse magnetic ﬁeld strength of the umbra is we aker than that of the penumbra. For the averageThe evolution of a decaying sunspot 5
vertical magnetic ﬁeld strength, the umbra is stronger than the penumbra. After 6:00 UT on September 12,
2015, the sunspot shatters into several pieces. Since the pr ogram do not work well for identifying subsequent
process after that time, the follow-up tracking is not conti nued.

data from September 6 to September 7 are added. The area unit i s set to millionths solar hemisphere (MSH),
and 1 MSH=3.32 M m2. The observational data in the three panels take appearance of Gaussian proﬁles. A
standard Gaussian function is used to ﬁt the area as follows: A(t) =ae−(t−b

represents time (day), area (MSH), maximum area value, star ting time to decay and standard deviation of
the decaying area, respectively. The function steepness at the median of maximum and minimum of the area
is considered to be the decay rate of the area, marked as DA ( Murak¨ ozy et al. 2014 ). All ﬁtting parameter
values are placed in each subgraph. To compare with previous studies which have shown quadratic decay of
the area of the sunspot, a classical quadratic ﬁtting is perf ormed to the area data between the beginning of
observation and the inﬂection point (a point whose the secon d derivative is equal to zero) on the right side
of the symmetry axis of the Gaussian ﬁtting, and the quadrati c ﬁtting curves are the magenta curves in the
Fig.2. The peak values for the decay of the area in the umbra, penumb ra, whole sunpot determined by the
quadratic ﬁtting are 10.01 MSH, 53.02 MSH and 63.44 MSH, resp ectively. The quadratic ﬁtting curves are
in good agreement with the scatter plots in the early stages o f the sunspot decay on different components
of the sunspot, and there will be big deviations between them in the late stages of the sunspot decay. We
take the moments at which the Gaussian ﬁtting vertexes are lo cated as the starting times for the decay of
different sunspot components. The area of the umbra is about 9.70 MSH at the beginning of the observation,
and increases to the peak (10.04 MSH), then decreases rapidl y to 7 MSH. After that, it decreases slowly.
The umbra has an area of 4.30 MSH at the end of observation. The area of the penumbra is 47 MSH at the
beginning of obsevation, and increases to the peak (54 MSH), then quickly decreases to 30 MSH. Finally,
it decays slowly to 8.70 MSH. For the whole sunspot, the area i ncreases from 57 MSH to 63.84 MSH at theThe evolution of a decaying sunspot 7
beginning, it starts to decay at 63.84 MSH, reduces rapidly t o 35 MSH, and then slowly decays to the end
of the observation. The area of the whole sunspot has a value o f 12.30 MSH at the end of the observation.
The Gaussian ﬁtting results show the umbra begins to decay ea rlier than the penumbra from parameter
b.Li et al. (2021 ) also found that, in some α-conﬁguration sunspots, the umbra ﬁrst starts to decay. The
standard deviations (from parameter c) of the umbra and penumbra are 5.53 MSH and 3.67 MSH, implying
that the penumbra decay process is more continuous. The area decay rates of the umbra, penumbra and
whole sunspot are -1.56 MSH day−1, -12.61MSH day−1and -14.04 MSH day−1. The penumbra decays
faster than the umbra.

The average change rate ( dr) for each panel is deﬁned as the steepness of the ﬁtting curve at the median
of the maxima and minima. Its unit is G day−1ordegree day−1. We describe the change of sunspot
magnetic ﬁeld parameters from the beginning of observation , and take the moments at which the peaks of
the quadratic ﬁtting curves as the starting times of the corr esponding magnetic ﬁeld parameter to decay.
The red vertical lines represent the moments at which the pea ks of the quadratic ﬁttings curves. The mean
magnetic ﬁeld strength of the umbra is 2200 G at the beginning of the observation, then it decreases slowly
ﬁrst and rapidly decreases to 1720 G at the end. The mean magne tic ﬁeld strength of the penumbra drops
slowly from 1090 G to a minimum value of 1075 G ﬁrst, it starts t o increase slowly from 1075 G and then
fast increases to 1380 G. The mean magnetic ﬁeld change rate o f the umbra and penumbra are -130.52
G day−1and 73.08 G day−1, respectively. Evidently, the mean magnetic ﬁeld strength change rate of the
penumbra is smaller than that of the umbra. The transverse ma gnetic ﬁeld of the umbra slowly increases
from 750 G to 755 G in the initial stage, while that of the penum bra increases slowly from 867 G to 870
G. The transverse magnetic ﬁeld strength for umbra and penum bra are 755 G and 870 G at the peaks,
decrease slowly at the beginning and then rapidly. The trans verse magnetic ﬁeld strength for the umbra
and the penumbra have values of 540 G and 765 G at the end. The ma ximum transverse magnetic ﬁeld
strength values for the umbra and the penumbra are 755 G and 87 0 G, respectively. The decay rates of the
transverse magnetic ﬁeld strength for the umbra and penumbr a are -60.99 G day−1and -33.17 G day−1,
respectively. The transverse magnetic ﬁeld strength of the umbra is weaker than that of the penumbra all
the time, and the transverse magnetic ﬁeld strength of the um bra decay faster than that of the penumbra.
The vertical magnetic ﬁeld strength of the umbra starts with a value of 2063 G, decreases slowly ﬁrst and
then rapidly to 1620 G. On the other hand, the vertical magnet ic ﬁeld strength of the penumbra decreases
slowly from 580 G to the valley (566 G) during the beginning st age of observation, and begins to increase
slowly ﬁrst and then rapidly to 1030 G. The change rate of the v ertical magnetic ﬁeld strength of the umbra
and penumbra are respectively -111.06 G day−1and 143.73 G day−1. Therefore, the vertical magnetic
ﬁeld strength of the umbra is rapidly decaying, while that of the penumbra is rapidly increasing. And
furthermore, the vertical magnetic ﬁeld value of the penumb ra changes faster than that of the umbra. With
the decrease of the mean magnetic ﬁeld strength of the sunspo t umbra, both the mean transverse magnetic
ﬁeld and mean vertical magnetic ﬁeld of the umbra decrease. I t suggests that the magnetic ﬁeld of the umbra
is gradually decreasing. The average inclination angle of t he umbra varies slightly. The mean value and
standard deviation of the inclination angle of the umbra are calculated as 20.36◦and0.9◦, respectively. It
indicates the magnetic ﬁeld inclination angle does not chan ge signiﬁcantly although the average magnetic
ﬁeld strength in the umbra decreases, and the magnetic ﬁeld h as been in a relatively vertical state. The
penumbra inclination angle increases slowly from 60◦to its peak ( 62◦) , then decreases to 38◦with a decay
rate of−7.30◦day−1. It clearly speciﬁes that the penumbra magnetic ﬁeld increa ses rapidly and becomes
more vertical during the sunspot decay. During the process o f decay, the variation trends of the magnetic
ﬁeld parameters in the whole sunspot are similar to that of th e penumbra, since the area of the penumbra is
much larger than that of the umbra.The evolution of a decaying sunspot 9

evolution of the magnetic ﬂux in the umbra, penumbra, and who le sunspot with time, respectively. The
quadratic curves are used to ﬁt the change trends of the magne tic ﬂux in the three regions of the sunspot,

The sunspot magnetic ﬂux with time is shown in Fig. 4. The magnetic ﬂux in the three regions of the
sunspot all show quadratic decay trends with time. The quadr atic function is used to ﬁt the change trend of
the magnetic ﬂux in the three regions of the sunspot, express ed as:Φ(t) =p1(t−p2)2+p3.Φ(t)is the
magnetic ﬂux (Unit: Mx) at time tin unit of day, the sign of the p1, and the p2,p3evaluates the opening
direction, the moment of maximum magnetic ﬂux, and the verte x value of the quadratic curve, respectively.
The steepness of the curve at the median of the maximum and min imum values is deﬁned as the decay rate
of the magnetic ﬂux (marked as DΦand its unit is Mx day−1). The magnetic ﬂux of the umbra decreases
slowly from 7.20×1020Mx at 00:00 UT on September 7, and then decreases fast to 2.10×1020Mx at
3:00 UT on September 12. At 00:00 UT on September 7, the magnet ic ﬂux of the penumbra is measured
to be a value of 10.04×1020Mx. It decreases slowly at ﬁrst, and then decrease fast to 2.90×1020Mx.
The change of magnetic ﬂux of the umbra is relatively discret e, while that of the penumbra is relatively
continuous. The magnetic ﬂux of the whole sunspot decreases from17.60×1020Mx at the beginning of
observation to 5.30×1020Mx at the end. Its process is still a slow decrease ﬁrst and the n a fast decrease.
The decay rates of magnetic ﬂux in the umbra, penumbra and who le sunspot are −9.84×1019Mxday−1,
−1.59×1020Mx day−1, and−2.60×1020Mx day−1, respectively. The magnetic ﬂux of the penumbra
decay faster than that of the umbra.
4 CONLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
The decay process of an α-conﬁguration sunspot has been studied. The quantitative e volution of the area,
magnetic ﬁeld properties, and the magnetic ﬂux of the sunspo t are calculated, respectively. The following
main results are obtained:
(1) The area decay of the sunspot in its umbra, penumbra, and w hole sunspot can be described by the
Gaussian-variation. The area decay rate of the umbra, penum bra and whole sunspot are -1.56 MSHday−1,
-12.61−1and -14.04−1, respectively.10 Y . Peng et al.
(2) With the decay of the sunspot, the total magnetic ﬁeld str ength and vertical magnetic ﬁeld strength of
the penumbra enhances, and the magnetic ﬁeld of the penumbra becomes more vertical. Meanwhile, the
magnetic ﬁeld strength and vertical magnetic ﬁeld strength for the umbra decays continuously. The mag-
netic ﬁeld inclination angle of the umbra changes slightly a nd is around 20 degrees.
(3) The magnetic ﬂux decay of the sunspot in the umbra, penumb ra, and whole sunspot behaves quadrati-
cally. The magnetic ﬂux decay rate of the umbra, penumbra and entire region are −9.84×1019Mxday−1,
−1.59×1020Mxday−1and−2.60×1020Mx day−1, respectively.
The previous studies have shown that the area decay process o f the sunspot is linear ( Solanki 2003 ;
Li et al. 2021 ) or quadratic ( Litvinenko & Wheatland 2015 ).Murak¨ ozy et al. (2014 ) studied the area growth
rates of 399 sunspot groups based on the solar and Heliospher ic Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager -
Derecen Data (SDD) sunspot catalogue, and found that asymme tric Gaussian function well ﬁtted the growth
and decay process of these sunspot groups. Murak¨ ozy (2020 ) also studied the relationship between the
decay rate of umbral and penumbral area and their total area b ased on SDD sunspot catalog, and concluded
that asymmetric Gaussian function also ﬁtted well the decay process of these sunspot groups. In our study,
the area decay of sunspots is ﬁtted well by Gaussian function , similar to that of Murak¨ ozy et al. (2014 ).
On the other hand, the quadratic ﬁtting curves are in good agr eement with the scatter plots in the early
stages of sunspot decay, however, there are big deviations b etween them in the late stages of the sunspot
decay. It indicates that the quadratic ﬁtting may be better f or the early decay stage of the sunspot, while the
Gaussian ﬁtting is better for the entire decay of the sunspot . The area decay rates of the umbra, penumbra,
and whole sunspot are -1.56 MSH day−1, -12.61MSH day−1and -14.04 MSH day−1, respectively. This
result is similar to the study of Li et al. (2021 ), but slightly smaller than the research of Martinez Pillet et al.
(1993b ).
Verma et al. (2018 ) studied penumbral decay of AR NOAA 12597 observed by GREGOR , and found
that a darkened region whose magnetic ﬁeld properties are si milar to that of an umbra was observed in
the penumbral ﬁlament. It indicated that the magnetic ﬁeld i n the penumbra became more vertical due to
ﬂux emergence. Wang et al. (2004 ) researched a rapid penumbral decay following three ﬂares a nd observed
that the magnetic ﬁeld in penumbra became more vertical. The y suggested that magnetic ﬁeld of part of
the penumbra was converted into magnetic ﬁeld state of the um bra. By studying the penumbra of several
delta sunspots, Wang et al. (2012 ) found that the magnetic ﬁeld of the penumbra tended to be mor e vertical
during ﬂares. It was attributed to the magnetic ﬁeld reconst ruction related to the ﬂares. In our observation,
the average magnetic ﬁeld of the penumbra becomes stronger, and the magnetic ﬁeld becomes more ver-
tical. However, the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the umbra show s a decline, and its inclination angle keeps a
constant. Maybe due to the submergence of the horizontal mag netic ﬁeld in the penumbra during sunspot
decay ( Rempel 2015 ), while relatively vertical magnetic ﬁeld still leaves in t he photosphere, and thus the
magnetic ﬁeld in the penumbra becomes more vertical on avera ge. The horizontal magnetic ﬁeld carries
more brightness and heat than the vertical magnetic ﬁeld, an d when the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld is lost
in the penumbra, the penumbra will either become dark or the c onvection within a more vertical magnetic
ﬁeld which resemble regular granulation will dominate the p enumbra (e.g. around pores). The observations
indicates that the penumbra may be transformed into umbra du ring sunspot decay.The evolution of a decaying sunspot 11
The decay process of the umbral magnetic ﬂux is relatively di screte, and exhibits a quadratic trend.
The decay process of the penumbral magnetic ﬂux also takes ap pearance of quadratic proﬁle, which is
consistent with Benko et al. (2021 ). The decay rates of magnetic ﬂux in the umbra, penumbra and w hole
sunspot are −9.84×1019Mxday−1,−1.59×1020Mx day−1, and−2.60×1020Mxday−1. The decay
rate of magnetic ﬂux in whole sunspot is consistent with the r esult of Sheeley et al. (2017 ). In the process
of the sunspot decay, there will be a lot of moving magnetic fe atures (MMFs) coming out from sunspot.
The magnetic ﬂux decay of the sunspot may be attributed to MMF s. The previous researches suggest that
the magnetic ﬂux in the sunspot is transported by MMFs to the s urrounding network during sunspot decay
(Verma et al. 2012 ;Deng et al. 2007 ). Some scholars believe that the MMF is a prolongation of the evershed
ﬂow in the penumbra ( Cabrera Solana et al. 2006 ;Schlichenmaier 2002 ).
