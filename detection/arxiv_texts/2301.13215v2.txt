Black hole evaporation is generally considered inevitable for low-mass black holes, yet there is
no confirmation of this remarkable hypothesis. Here, we propose a phenomenological model that
appeals to the possible survival of light quasi-extremal primordial black holes as a significant dark
matter component and show that the related cosmological and astrophysical constraints disappear
for reasonable degrees of quasi-extremality. The results obtained are general, conservative and
should be taken as a proof of principle for future, model-specific analyses.
I. INTRODUCTION
Since first postulated in the late ‘60s [1–4], primor-
dial black holes (PBHs) are regarded as a viable dark
matter (DM) candidate, albeit over a highly constrained
mass range (see e.g., [5–8]). The most appealing exam-
ple is given by a range roughly between 1017and 1022g,
bounded from below by constraints coming from the im-
pact of the energy injection following Hawking evapora-
tion of the PBHs [9] on observables such as cosmic mi-
crowave background (CMB) anisotropies [10–13], cosmic
rays [14], and 21 cm lines [15].
These bounds on PBH evaporation are, however, de-
rived under the assumption that the PBHs are non-
rotating and neutral, which maximizes their evapora-
tion rate. In fact, it is well known that if the BHs
were charged and/or spinning, their Hawking temper-
ature would decrease, and consequently so would their
mass loss rate and luminosity. In the limit where the
temperature approaches zero one has what are referred
to as quasi-extremal PBHs (qPBHs). Since increasing
degrees of quasi-extremality can be reached, this implies
that the aforementioned mass range could be extended
to lower masses by decreasing Hawking evaporation.
Nevertheless, the formation and survivability of qPBHs
is clearly a contentious issue. The acquisition of extreme
spin-to-mass ratios is astrophysically forbidden for BH
growth by accretion in thin [16] or thick disks [17]. Even
if the PBHs had a spin at formation, it would be lost
more efficiently than its mass [18, 19], making quasi-
extremality impossible to obtain over extended periods
of time. A similar discussion also applies to the case of
charged BHs [20].
One can, however, invoke other processes to justify the
existence of qPBHs at lower masses. For instance, accre-
tion and Schwinger pair production can reduce the BH
charge Q, but Hawking evaporation can counter these
effects and augment the charge-to-mass ratio [21]. Such
relics have often been considered as DM candidates [22–
25]. Indeed, small quantized BHs have a fundamentalstable state defined by a mass equal to the Planck value
and a spin J=ℏ[26]. We emphasize furthermore that
PBHs can form deep in the radiation era where stabilized
qPBHs are possible DM candidates if their fractional
abundance at formation is as low as ∼10−25, and the ap-
plication of extreme value statistics leads to the expecta-
tion that some of the DM may plausibly include a qPBH
component [27]. The motivation for the rarity of ex-
tremely light qPBHs comes from the equilibrium charge
distribution [28] once the emission of charged particles
of random sign is included, P(Q)∼exp[−4πα(Q/e)2],
where αis the electromagnetic coupling and the PBHs
rms charge satisfies Q/e = 1/√
8πα≈6. Also PBHs
living in an higher-dimensional space are DM candi-
dates [29, 30]. Provided that the scale of the extra di-
mension is of the order of the gravitational radius, we
show below that such BHs may be quasi-extremal. Fur-
thermore, as shown in [31], even Schwarzschild BHs may
depart from Hawking evaporation after the Page time
due to the so-called memory burden effect. If this is the
case then the BH evolution is non-Markovian and the
evaporation rate is suppressed.
More generally, we argue that since Hawking radiation
has never been tested experimentally or even unambigu-
ously demonstrated to occur from a rigorous theoretical
perspective, one can treat the approach to extremality
as a phenomenological constraint on the Hawking tem-
perature and the associated Hawking evaporation rate.
The argument that there are no robust mechanisms for
generating quasi-extremality is fallacious in that it rests
on our ignorance, and most notably we provide several
counterexamples above. We show that useful insights
into different types of PBHs are provided by testing the
degree of quasi-extremality with cosmological and astro-
physical data.
It is therefore not unreasonable to expect qPBHs to
exist in a realistic cosmological scenario. Yet, the impact
that such quasi-extremality would have on the commonly
imposed cosmological and astrophysical constraints on
PBH evaporation has not been systematically consideredULB-TH/23-01

in the literature so far. Here we address this task and
propose a very general phenomenological analysis to be
taken as a proof of principle for future, more specific
studies. As a result, in our simplified and yet conservative
scenario, we find that for values of the quasi-extremality
parameter ε(defined in terms of e.g., the PBH charge
Qand mass Masε2= 1−Q2/M2) lower than ≲10−3
all cosmological and astrophysical constraints allow for
PBHs to make up for the totality of the DM, and that
they become stable over cosmological times for masses as
low as ∼1011g. This implies that for sufficiently low
values of ε, qPBHs are a viable DM candidate.
Moreover, another reason for being interested in the
possibility that qPBHs could be observable is recent
progress in string theory and quantum gravity, suggest-
ing that extremal and nearly-extremal BHs could be
more exotic objects than previously thought. For (near-
)extremal BHs, although one can take the classical limit
in gravity, MP→ ∞ , there is a special class of quantum
gravity effects that do not decouple [32–34]. Therefore,
(near-)extremal BHs are probably the best magnifying
lenses that one can use to observe quantum gravitational
effects. Hence possibilities for observing them are truly
exciting.
This work is organized as follows. In Sec. II we
discuss both how such levels of quasi-extremality can
be reached and maintained over cosmic times, and how
they affect the standard picture of Hawking evaporation.
In Sec. III we overview the many cosmological and as-
trophysical observables affected by the presence of this
quasi-extremality and suggest simple ways to recast ex-
isting bounds in the quasi-extremal limit. In Sec. IV we
present the resulting constraints on qPBHs as a function
of both the quasi-extremality parameter and the frac-
tional abundance of the PBHs. In Sec. V we conclude
with a summary and closing remarks.
II. QUASI-EXTREMAL PRIMORDIAL BLACK
HOLES
In this section we provide a brief overview of scenarios
that can generate quasi-extremal BHs. We do so by high-
lighting the general features that they share and how the
analysis presented here can be considered as a proof of
principle for other, more specific examples. We further-
more also discuss how this general scenario would affect
the standard picture of BH evaporation.
A. Representative examples
A first well-known example of qPBHs is given by highly
charged BHs, in particular Reissner-Nordstrom (RN)
BHs. In this case, to parameterize the degree of quasi-extremality we can define the parameter εsuch that1
1−Q2
M2=ε2≪1, (1)
where Mis the mass and Qis the electric charge of the
BH. RN BHs have two horizons: the outer, corresponding
to the event horizon, and the inner, the Cauchy horizon,
defined by the zeros of the lapse function, that is
r±=M"
1±r
1−Q2
M2#
=M(1±ε). (2)
The size of the outer horizon should never be smaller than
the BH-associated Compton wavelength. This condition
gives the Planck mass as the smallest PBH mass.
The notion of the dual horizon also applies to Kerr
BHs, which represent a second possible qPBH solution
should they spin to a high degree. Here the similar hori-
zon structure is now characterized by
r±=M"
1±r
1−a2
M2#
=M(1±ε), (3)
where ais the dimensionless spin parameter (related to
the angular momentum Jviaa=J/M), and, analo-
gously to Eq. (1), we can then also define
1−a2
M2=ε2, (4)
which shows a similar mass dependence of the relation
between εand the model-specific parameters Qanda.
It is therefore clear that much of the model dependence
of the aforementioned scenarios can be captured by the
single parameter ε, which represents the degree of ex-
tremality of the BH. In the following discussion we will
then only make use of εso as to be as general as possible
in our conclusions.
In a realistic cosmological scenario, however, it is well
known that any charge or spin would be lost very quickly
by any BH population of primordial origin. Quasi-
extremal primordial RN or Kerr BHs are therefore not
expected to exist today. Based on these models, it is nev-
ertheless possible to envision a scenario where the BH is
charged, but instead of standard electromagnetism (EM)
the BH is charged under a generic EM-like dark charge
whose carriers are always much heavier than the temper-
ature of the BH [25]. In this way, one obtains the same
mathematical setup as for a RN BH, but with the dif-
ference that the charge Qdoes not get evaporated away
from the BH and remains therefore constant.
From Eq. (1), however, one can infer that a constant
Qdoes not necessarily imply a constant ε. In fact, since
initially the charge will always be smaller than the mass
1Here and henceforth we assume G=c=ℏ=kB= 1.3
of the BH, εwill always be larger than zero and the BH
will radiate its mass at the rate discussed in the following
section. Nevertheless, the smaller the mass (i.e., the more
the BH evaporates) the more εwill approach the zero
value and the slower the mass loss rate becomes. This
means that a constant charge with Q < M leads to a BH
that naturally approaches extremality over cosmic times.
On the other hand, Eq. (1) shows that if both Qand
Mare radiated away at the same rate, εstays constant.
This means that in a setup where the initial charge-to-
mass ratio is very close to unity and both quantities get
radiated at the same rate, the BH can maintain extremal-
ity indefinitely. However, contrary to the constant-charge
example mentioned above, this scenario would require a
larger degree of fine-tuning, as one would need to fix the
characteristics of the charged dark particles to be exactly
such that the BH loses charge and mass at the same rate.
Another possibility to obtain (and maintain) quasi-
extremality that does not depend on charge or spin but
that presents very similar features in terms of εis given
by higher dimensional BHs [29, 30]. One could, in fact,
consider the 5D gravitational theory compactified on a
circle of radius Rwith R≲1µm, although the notion
of quasi-extremality is generalizable to ddimensions. In
that case, BHs with a horizon size smaller than Rbehave
as 5D BHs while those with size larger then Ras 4D BHs.
One can then show (see App. A) that the evaporation
of all Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of a d-dimensional BH
leads to an effective degree of extremality
ε−4
eff= 3(d−3)
(d−1)S4
Sd2πR
rs2(d−4)
. (5)
A “large” BH with rs≫Revaporates following the 4D
decay equation until its horizon becomes rs≃R. From
that point on, it decays as a higher-dimensional BH at
a rate that is slower than in 4D. This implies that a
higher-dimensional BH would tend to quasi-extremality
the more it evaporates, qualitatively just like a constant-
charge BH.
In summary, in the discussion above, we have high-
lighted different ways to justify the existence of qPBHs
which can all be phenomenologically described by the
evolution of εin the respective scenarios. For simplicity,
hereafter we will solely focus on the aforementioned (RN
BH) case with a constant εvalue. With respect to the
other possibilities, this choice is conservative in the sense
that, for the same initial value of ε, in the other scenarios
the degree of extremality would only increase and hence
they would be covered by the results obtained for the
constant εcase (see [24, 25, 29, 30] for related but rel-
atively limited discussions). Furthermore, we point out
that, although based on a slightly less realistic scenario,
ours has to be taken as a useful proof of principle to be
applied to more specific examples in the future.B. Evaporation
Given these possible sources of quasi-extremality, it is
interesting to consider how one might observe the decay
of these quasi-extremal BHs and set constraints on their
modified evaporation emission.
The key quantity that is modified by the quasi-
extremality of the BHs is their evaporation temperature
T, which now reads (assuming e.g., a RN BH, but with
no loss of generality)
T=1
4πr+
1−Q2
r2
+
=1
8πM22ε
(1 +ε)2, (6)
where εencapsulates the deviations from the standard
Hawking temperature. Once the temperature is defined,
it becomes possible to determine the luminosity Lof the
BH via the Stefan-Boltzmann black body formula2,
L=AσT4∝r2
+T4∝26ε4
(1 +ε)6M2, (7)
where A= 4πr2
+is the area of the BH and σis the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This simple dependence of
the luminosity is however strictly speaking only valid as
long as the BH evaporates at a constant rate. Neverthe-
less, since different particles can be emitted at different
BH temperatures, it is more convenient to interpret the
luminosity as the energy emission rate with explicit de-
pendence on the mass loss rate d M/dt, such that
L=−dM
dt26ε4
(1 +ε)6, (8)
where the εdependence needs to be introduced for con-
sistency with Eq. (7).
The mass loss rate of an evaporating BH is commonly
defined in terms of the total energy carried away by
the emitted particles (due to energy conservation argu-
ments), i.e., following the relation
dM
dt=−ZX
jdNj
dtdEEdE , (9)
where d Nj/dtdEis the number of emitted particles jof
spinsin the energy interval between ( E,E+ dE) and is
defined as
dNj
dtdE=1
2πΓj
e(E−µj)/T−(−1)2sj. (10)
2Near extremality the Stefan-Boltzmann formula is modified by
important grey-body factors that tend to suppress emission (see
e.g., [35] for a related discussion). We do not consider such fac-
tors and therefore our formulae should be considered as upper
bounds on Hawking emission near extremality in the RN case.
In the higher-dimensional case such factors are not important.4
Here, Γ jis the dimensionless absorption probability of
the given emitted species, which, in full generality, de-
pends on both Mandε. The presence of charge and spin
can in fact enhance or reduce the probability of charged
particles or particles with spin (mis-)aligned with that
of the BH to be emitted from the system. For stan-
dard RN BHs charged under EM, [28] found that the
impact of the charge on Γ jis of the order of a few per-
cent. In Eq. (10), µjrefers to the chemical potential of
a given emitted particle and generally depends on ε. For
instance, in the case of standard charged BHs, it would
take the form µj∝qjp
(1−ε)/(1 +ε), where qjis the
charge of the particle. In our simplified scenario, how-
ever, we assume that the particles carrying the charge of
the quasi-extremal BH are not emitted from the BH at
all (or at least very slowly) and we can therefore neglect
these ε-dependent contributions to Γ jandµj.
Under this simplifying assumption, the only way εaf-
fects the mass loss rate is via the exponential dependence
of dNj/dtdQon the BH temperature T. This determines
what particles are kinematically available at a given tem-
perature Tand it therefore makes sense for it to be de-
pendent on the temperature of the system only, regard-
less of the characteristics of the BH reaching that tem-
perature. One can then simply extend the validity of the
results found in [36, 37] according to which
dM
dt=−5.34×1025f(T)
M2g/s, (11)
where f(T) defines the number of emitted species and can
be expressed as in Eq. (9) of [37] (see also [11, 12] for
additional details, updated coefficients and contributions
beyond the QCD phase transition).3
With this definition of the mass loss rate it is then
possible to compute the lifetime of the BH by integrating
Eq. (8). Following again [37], one obtains
tev= 6.24×10−27M3
f(T)(1 +ε)6
26ε4s. (12)
III. IMPACT ON THE OBSERVABLES
Once the mass loss rate due to the PBH evaporation
and the related luminosity have been defined, it is pos-
sible to analyse how the emission of particles from the
PBH affects various cosmological and astrophysical ob-
servables such as the CMB anisotropies as well as the
cosmic and γ-ray spectra. Since all of these probes are
3Concretely, focusing for instance on the left panel of Fig. 10
of [12] for a graphical representation, the only aspect of the plot
that would be modified by the presence of a non-zero εwould be
the relation between the two horizontal axis, reporting the PBH
mass Mand the corresponding Tvalues, with the latter being
shifted more and more to the left the higher the value of ε.sensitive to different epochs of the universe, they also con-
strain different mass ranges, allowing us to cover a wide
region of parameter space. In the following sections, we
describe all of the constraints and explain how they are
affected by the presence of evaporating qPBHs.
A. BBN
The first observable we focus on is Big Bang Nu-
cleosynthesis (BBN), which covers the period of light-
element formation, such as deuterium and helium, in the
early universe [38]. The predictions of standard BBN
are in extremely good agreement with measurements of
the corresponding abundances in the first galaxies, where
galactic dynamics and star formation have not had the
time to affect the primordial abundances yet [39]. In-
ferred quantities such as the baryon energy density, the
baryon-to-photon ratio and the primordial helium abun-
dance are also consistent with CMB measurements [40].
Given the success of the standard BBN model, this
probe has been often employed to constrain beyond-the-
standard-model (BSM) physics, such as annihilating or
decaying DM [41, 42] or PBH evaporation [13, 43], typ-
ically delivering the most stringent constraints on these
types of models prior to recombination. In fact, BBN
can constrain BSM models in a variety of ways, from the
impact that they might have on the expansion of the uni-
verse (changing e.g., the number of relativistic degrees of
freedom) to the photo-disintegration of the light elements
after BBN is completed.
Precisely this richness of constraints, however, prevents
us from deriving simple and general limits that can be
recast for any value of ε. This is due to the fact that,
for instance, εaffects both the overall and the relative
amount of injected species (via the modification to f(T))
as well as the lifetime of the PBHs. Therefore, different
aspects of the standard BBN picture might be modified
in non-trivial ways, affecting the magnitude and shape
of the constraints. BBN bounds on qPBH evaporation
would then have to be derived with dedicated analyses.
For this reason, the accurate inclusion of the BBN con-
straints in the following discussion goes beyond the proof-
of-principle type of study conducted here and will not be
considered any further. We note, however, that, albeit
the scaling of the constraints is not directly proportional
toεas for the probes discussed below, we do expect a
significant suppression of the constraints the lower the
value is of εand that the results of this work will not be
affected by the non-inclusion of the BBN constraints.
B. CMB
1. CMB anisotropies
CMB anisotropies are very well known to be affected
by exotic energy injections during the dark ages (see5
e.g., [10] for a thorough discussion). In fact, in that
period of the thermal history of the universe, the cos-
mic medium was almost perfectly neutral, allowing the
CMB photons to travel straight from the last scatter-
ing surface (at z≃1100) to us. Any injection of parti-
cles with enough energy to ionize the abundant hydrogen
atoms would have increased the amount of free electrons,
thereby enhancing the probability of further scattering
of the CMB photons. This modification of the so-called
visibility function would in turn affect the shape of the
CMB anisotropy power spectra (both temperature and
polarization). Since the observed spectra are in perfect
agreement with the ΛCDM model in the absence of any
energy injection [40], the CMB anisotropies can be used
to constrain processes such as the evaporation of PBHs.
In order to estimate the extent to which PBH evapora-
tion affects the CMB anisotropies one needs to determine
the energy injection rate, which in this case is given by
dE
dtdV
inj=ρcdmfPBHL
M, (13)
where fPBHis the (primordial) fractional abundance of
PBHs with respect to the DM. This injected energy does
not, however, necessarily coincide with the effectively de-
posited energy. In fact, for instance, part of the injected
energy might be in form of non-electromagnetically in-
teracting particles and not all of it is spent to ionize the
medium (some of this energy would heat up or excite
the plasma). These contributions are commonly taken
into account by deposition efficiency feffand deposition
fraction per channel χc, respectively [10–12, 44–46]. Ex-
plicitly, this implies
dE
dtdV
dep,c=dE
dtdV
injfeffχc. (14)
A graphical representation of the heating rate due to
PBH evaporation is displayed in Fig. 5 of [12]. The con-
sequent impact of PBH evaporation on the free electron
fraction can be seen in e.g., Fig. 6 of [10]4, while that in
relation to the CMB power spectra can be found in Fig. 6
of [11]. Some important remarks can be drawn from the
figures. First of all, the majority of the energy injection
takes place around the lifetime of the PBH, similarly to
the DM decay scenario. This means that the injection
time can be roughly approximated to coincide with the
lifetime of the PBHs. Secondly, only PBHs with masses
larger than 1013g evaporate after recombination and can
therefore be constrained with CMB anisotropies.
Based on Sec. II B, the energy deposition rate has a
dependence on the PBH parameters of the form
dE
dtdV
dep∝fPBHf(T) 26ε4
M3(1 +ε)6. (15)
4From the left panel of the figure it becomes clear that heating
and ionization rates are rather correlated, so that the heating
rate shown in [12] is also indicative of the ionization rate.In the ε= 1 case, f(T) is almost constant for masses
above 1013g (it varies at most by a factor 3, see e.g.,
Fig. 10 of [12]) meaning that the energy deposition rate
has a simple dependence of the form fPBH/M3. This
implies a proportionality of the constraints on the PBH
abundance as M3, which is perfectly recovered in the
bounds shown in e.g., [11–13].
On the other hand, the simple proportionality of
Eq. (15) also allows us to take into account the contri-
bution of εby simply rescaling the bounds on fPBHby a
factor f(Tε=1)(1 + ε)6/(f(T)26ε4), where f(Tε=1) is the
value of f(T) in the ε= 1 case (i.e., for a Schwarzschild
BH). The overall order of magnitude of the rescaling is
given by the chosen value of ε, with the f(T) ratio in-
troducing a further enhancement of at most the order
of a few (and never more than ten). At the same time,
since the constraints are time-sensitive – in this case, for
instance, they are most stringent for PBH masses corre-
sponding to tevaround the time of recombination – also
the PBH mass needs to be rescaled. Explicitly, qPBHs
survive longer the lower the value of ε. Since the evap-
oration time tevis proportional to the PBH mass, this
implies that for a qPBH with ϵ < 1 and a PBH with
ε= 1 to evaporate at the same time one needs to assume
a lower mass in the qPBH case. The proportionality fac-
tor is the one given in Eq. (12), i.e., the same as for fPBH
above. The combination of the rescalings of fPBHandM
enables us to recast existing constraints, such as the ones
derived in e.g., [11–13], for any value of ε.
Here we rely on the bounds derived in [13], which are
based on Planck 2015 data [47]. Corresponding con-
straints employing Planck 2018 data [40] have been de-
rived in [12] and seem to be approximately one order of
magnitude more constraining than those of [13]. Never-
theless, [12] employed a simplified thermal history and
made use of a mock likelihood instead of real data. For
this reason, and for sake of being conservative, we choose
to focus on the results of [13]. Furthermore, compared to
other results based on Planck 2015 data such as [11, 48],
the findings of [13] overlap well for PBH masses cor-
responding to lifetimes longer than recombination but
improve upon them at lower masses, where the PBHs
evaporate before recombination. This is due to a better
analysis of the delay between the energy injection and its
deposition which extends the constraints down to evap-
oration redshifts of the order of z≃5×103.
2. CMB spectral distortions
In brief, CMB spectral distortions (SDs) are any type
of deviation of the CMB energy spectrum from a pure
black body [12, 49–51]. They are typically created by
the injection of energy or photons in the thermal bath,
although they can also be produced by effects such as the
dissipation of acoustic waves and adiabatic cooling. Com-
plementary to the CMB anisotropies, CMB SDs are very
sensitive to the thermal history of the universe prior to6
recombination, up to redshifts of the order of z≃2×106.
In the context of PBH evaporation, as in the case of
the CMB anisotropies, their shape is determined by the
amount of injected energy defined in Eq. (14). A key
difference is, however, that for CMB SDs it is the heat-
ing rate that needs to be considered and not the ioniza-
tion rate (which would anyway be zero before recombi-
nation). This implies that the same rescaling of existing
bounds (see e.g., [12, 52–54]) discussed in the previous
section can be employed for SDs as well. Here we fol-
low the results of [53] based on FIRAS data [55, 56],
which perfectly overlap with the more recent and exact
calculations of [54] at very high evaporation redshifts (or,
equivalently, for very low PBH masses), but extend them
until recombination.
C. 21 cm
Another cosmological observable that can be employed
to constrain the evaporation of PBHs are the 21 cm ab-
sorption lines (see e.g., [57–59] for reviews of the observ-
able and [15, 60–62] for PBH-related discussions). These
lines are generated whenever a neutral hydrogen atom
undergoes a spin-flip transition and are therefore a very
important tracker of the neutral hydrogen distribution
across space and time. The probability of this transition
to happen is proportional to the relative abundance of the
two spin levels, which in turn depends on what is known
as the spin temperature TS. Since TSis determined by
the CMB and gas temperature, any process that affects
the latter inevitably modifies also the 21 cm signal.
This logic has been applied to constrain several
beyond-ΛCDM models (see e.g., [58] and references
therein for a recent overview), and here we focus on the
case of PBH evaporation [15]. As extensively explained
in the references, the relation between energy injection
and modified 21 cm signal is dictated by the same equa-
tions discussed in the previous section in the context of
CMB anisotropies. This similarity is qualitatively con-
firmed, for instance, in Fig. 4 of the reference, where the
same fPBH∝M3proportionality is shown for the 21 cm
constraints. Therefore, in analogy to the previous section
also in the 21 cm case we can simply recast the existing
bounds of [15] to account for the role of ε.
D. Diffuse γ-ray background
Next we move to constraints of astrophysical origin,
i.e., focusing on the evaporation of PBHs in the local
environment. Firstly, we consider the case of the diffuse
extra-galactic γ-ray background. The idea in this context
is then to consider the observed γ-ray fluxes, observed
by e.g., Fermi LAT [63] and HAWC [64], and to im-
pose the condition that the flux of photons emitted from
the cosmological PBH population does not exceed this
limit. This exercise has been performed in e.g., [43, 65–67] (see Fig. 5 of [43]) including a number of observations
and found that this probe is particularly constraining for
PBH masses around 1015g. The constraints from the
galactic flux have been computed in [68, 69] and most
recently in [70], but turn out to be subdominant with
respect to the aforementioned 21 cm constraints in the
relevant mass range and will therefore be neglected here.
Since these extra-galactic constraints depend on the
flux of photons emitted from the PBHs, i.e.,
ϕγ=1
4πZ
LγnPBHdt∝fPBH
tev, (16)
where Lγis the emitted luminosity in form of photons
andnPBHis the PBH number density, also in this case the
constraints have a power-law dependence on ε4/(1 +ε)6,
which allows for a straightforward rescaling of the afore-
mentioned bounds derived in [43].
E. Cosmic rays
A similar discussion can be also carried out for galactic
cosmic rays, such as electrons and positrons [71–73]. The
observational difficulty in this case is, however, that low-
energy charged particles are significantly affected by the
heliosphere of the sun and this limits the amount of infor-
mation that can be extracted from the data. This prob-
lem has been overcome with the exit from the heliosphere
of the Voyager 1 spacecraft [74] and now it is therefore
possible to combine Voyager 1 [75] and AMS-02 [76] data
to constrain the cosmic ray flux over an energy range
between a few MeV and hundreds of GeV.
These data sets have been employed by [14] to bound
the PBH abundance in the mass range between 5 ×1014−
3×1016g, where they are also the most constraining to
date. As for the γ-rays, also in this case the limits rely
on the definition of the flux of particles from the PBHs,
so that the same εrescaling applies here as well.
F. Diffuse high-energy neutrino background
Finally, the observation of the neutrino flux at facilities
such as IceCube [77] and Super-Kamiokande [78] would
enable us to constrain the PBH abundance in the local
environment. However, so far the current sensitivity of
these experiments has not been able to set competitive
bounds with respect to the aforementioned ones [79]. We
will therefore not consider these observations in the fol-
lowing discussion, but point them out as a promising
avenue for the future.
G. Comment on non-evaporation constraints
On top of the constraints that can be imposed on PBHs
via their Hawking evaporation, also other bounds can be7

derived via e.g., eventual gravitational effects, astrophys-
ical arguments as well as the accretion of matter onto the
BHs (see e.g., [7] for a recent review). Typically, all of
these limits apply to masses well above 1020g, where
the lifetime of the PBHs is much larger than the age of
the universe. In this regime, the effect of Hawking evap-
oration is greatly suppressed and the mass loss rate is
negligible. As a consequence, these constraints are in-
sensitive to the quasi-extremal origin of the PBHs and
are not modified by the value of ϵ.
A possible exception would be the limits due to the
assumed formation mechanism. In fact, as mentioned
above the production of qPBHs would require very spe-
cific characteristics that could affect the evolution of the
universe aside from the consequent Hawking evaporation.
Nevertheless, since these bounds would be strongly model
dependent, we do not consider them any further in this
work.
IV. RESULTS
The collection of the cosmological and astrophysical
constraints on the PBH abundance discussed in the pre-
vious section is summarized in the left panel of Fig. 1.
There, we also display the BBN constraints derived in
[13, 43] for reference (solid green line), although they are
not rescaled as the others and are only to be relied upon
for the ϵ= 1 case. We remark, however, that the con-
clusions drawn below do not depend on this limitation of
the analysis.
In the figure, the solid lines represent the cases with
ε= 1, while dashed, dashed-dotted and dotted lines refer
respectively to the ε= 0.1,0.01 and 0.001 cases. As ex-pected, the constraints are significantly suppressed and
shifted to lower masses the lower the value of ε. In fact,
as argued in the previous section the upper bound on
the PBH abundance relaxes roughly proportionally to
ε4/(1 + ε)6both vertically and horizontally, which in
turns means that the largest mass allowed by evapora-
tion constrains for fPBH = 1 reduces to approximately
3×1015g for ε= 0.1, to 3 ×1013g for ε= 0.01 and all
PBH masses are allowed for ε≲10−3.
We also show as vertical lines the PBH masses whose
lifetime would correspond to the age of the universe (with
the same line style as above). This sets the threshold
above which the PBHs are still present in the universe
today (or, alternatively, below which they are already
evaporated). While in the ε= 1 this corresponds to
approximately 4 .1×1014g, this value scales as in Eq. (12),
i.e., approximately as ( ε4/(1 +ε)6)1/3. This means that
forε∼10−3even PBHs as light as ∼1011g would
survive until today.
The combination of these two conclusions, i.e., that
qPBHs with ε≤10−3can match the correct DM abun-
dance and that they would still be present today, opens
the door to the interesting possibility that such light
qPBHs could be the DM. Of course, this will need to
be developed in the context of more refined qPBH mod-
els, but can still act as a useful (conservative) benchmark
for such scenarios.
Interestingly, for relatively small values of ε, the
bounds presented in the left panel of Fig. 1 can be ap-
proximated to be on the parameter combination fPBHϵ4
(neglecting the dependence on f(T) and on the second
order εterm, see Eq. (15)). This allows for a very simple,
order-of-magnitude reinterpretation of the constraints for
any value of ε. Furthermore, it also allows us to present8
the limits in the ε−Mplane for fixed values of fPBH,
which can be useful for realistic models where the qPBHs
are predicted to be a given sub-component of the DM.
We perform this exercise (with the exact dependence of
Eq. (15)) in the right panel of Fig. 1 for the representa-
tive cases of fPBH= 1,10−4,10−8. The figure confirms
the aforementioned discussion.
V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The analysis carried out here focuses on PBHs in the
mass range between ∼1010−1017g. The allowed abun-
dance of such PBHs is mostly constrained by the impact
of their evaporation on cosmological and astrophysical
observables such as the CMB, the 21 cm lines and cosmic
rays. Nevertheless, these stringent limits are derived as-
suming non-spinning, neutral (i.e., Schwarzschild) BHs,
a scenario that maximizes the evaporation efficiency. If
one assumes instead that the BHs are e.g., charged, spin-
ning or even living in a higher-dimensional space, their
evaporation temperature decreases, and consequently so
does their luminosity. This approach can be pushed to
the limit where the evaporation stops completely, leading
to what are known as extremal BHs.
In this work we consider so-called quasi-extremal
PBHs and show that indeed the assumption of quasi-
extremality can greatly suppress the aforementioned con-
straints on the PBH evaporation. Concretely, we anal-
yse the case of a general and conservative scenario where
the degree of quasi-extremality is captured by a model-
independent parameter ε, which we assume to be con-
stant for simplicity. In the context of charged BHs, for
instance, this quasi-extremality parameter would be de-
fined as ε2= 1−Q2/M2, where QandMrepresent
charge and mass of the PBH, respectively. As a result,
we find i)that all constraints vanish for ε≲10−3and
ii)that for these values of εall PBHs with masses larger
than∼1011g would still be present today. The combina-
tion of these conclusions implies that such light qPBHs
are a viable DM candidate.
However, the question of observability remains. In
fact, given the dependencies on εof the constraints dis-
cussed in Sec. III we do not expect that upcoming ex-
periments such as CMB-S4 [80, 81] and SKA [82] (see
e.g., [12, 83] for related forecasts) would be able to sig-
nificantly change the current picture since qPBHs with
ε≲10−3would still largely evade them. Further-
more, even if a survey did observe a signature compati-
ble with the energy injection following the evaporation of
PBHs, it would be impossible to disentangle the case of a
Schwarzschild PBH population from that of a more abun-
dant population of lighter qPBHs. Therefore, cosmolog-
ical and astrophysical probes testing Hawking evapora-
tion are a priori not sensitive enough to uniquely prove
the existence of qPBHs and complementary observations
would become fundamental.
For instance, while microscopic PBHs might make upfor most of the DM if they are quasi-extremal, there
may also be a high mass tail, which would provide a
unique gravitational wave (GW) signature observable by
future observatories such as LISA [84]. In fact, the de-
gree of quasi-extremality has an impact on the GW sig-
nature in the case of a merger and values of 1 −a(and,
similarly, of ε) as small as 10−9may be detectable in
the waveform measurable by LISA for extreme mass ra-
tio merger events [85]. Such BH-BH interactions might
also leave unique signatures in the early universe, as
would be the case for opposite charge BH encounters,
although we leave a more accurate investigation of this
possibility for future work. Another avenue to disentan-
gle Schwarzschild and qPBHs in a potential cosmological
observation is to determine the PBH mass independently,
which can be achieved by e.g., gravitational direct detec-
tion [86] and other direct detection techniques [24].
In summary, in this work we have shown that light,
quasi-extremal PBHs can be the DM and argued that
with the help of complementary GW observations, an
accurate determination of their characteristics might be
within reach. The results found here are general and
conservative, and should be taken as the basis for future,
model-specific studies.

Appendix A: More details on the properties of
four-dimensional and higher-dimensional black holes
In this appendix we collect some useful formulae
that pertain to the properties of 4D as well as higher-
dimensional Schwarzschild BHs.

where

c2ℏ3(A5)
is the standard Stefan-Boltzmann coefficient. This for-
mula is also valid for massive particles emitted, provided
their mass mc2≪TH. For the Standard Model (SM)
of particle physics plus Gravity, this means photons and
gravitons, For M≫2.5×1018g we can neglect there-
fore the emission of other SM particles. For 5 ×1012g
≪M≪2.5×1018g, one should also include the three
SM neutrinos. For 2 .5×1010g≪M≪5×1012g one
should include electron emission, and so on.
Solving Eq. (A4) we obtain for the evolution of the
mass

The evaporation formulae above are assuming massless
photons. Including gravitons doubles the rate. Grey-
body factors are ignored as they are not important for
standard Schwarzschild BHs as absorption cross sections
are geometrical in the IR and suppressed in the UV
regime.
2. General dimension d≥4
We now move to dspacetime dimensions with d≥4
and we set ℏ=c= 1. In this case, the definitions of
Schwarzschild radius and Hawking temperature can be
generalized as

In that case the 4D, G, and d-dimensional Newton con-

Simple physical arguments indicate that when the BH is
much smaller in size than R, i.e., with
rs≪R , (A16)
then it behaves as a d-dimensional BH. From Eq. (A8)
we obtain that kTH≫1
Rand therefore the BH can ra-
diate all Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of the graviton and
other fields. Its lifetime from Eq. (A15) is much longer
than a 4D BH of the same mass. Moreover, if rs≪R
then during the evaporation process, the horizon radius
becomes smaller and smaller and the whole evaporation
process happens in the d-dimensional regime.

In the extreme case, R≃1µm, we obtain

If on the other hand we have a BH with a horizon
radius rs≫R, in this case the BH behaves as 4D BH.
The temperature is much smaller than the KK mass scale
and none of the KK states can be emitted. While it
is evaporating, it will start doing so by using the 4D
formula, but as its horizon radius becomes smaller than
R, then it starts evaporating as a d-dimensional BH. The
transition mass M∗is given by rs=R,
2G M∗=R⇒ M∗=MPR
2MP (A19)
with
MPR≲1028. (A20)
In the extreme case of R= 1µm, we obtain
M∗≃1023gr. (A21)
Simplifying, we assume that the evaporation process
happens as 4D, until Mreduces to M∗and as higher d
when M < M ∗, and we obtain,
