Abstract
We considera(pseudo)Riemannianmanifoldofarbitrarydim ension. TheHamil-
ton–Jacobi equation for geodesic Hamiltonian admits compl ete separation of vari-
ables for some (separable) metrics in some (separable) coor dinate systems. Separa-
ble metrics are very important in mathematics and physics. T he St¨ ackel problem is:
“Which metrics admit complete separation of variables in th e geodesic Hamilton–
Jacobi equation?” This problem was solved for inverse metri cs with nonzero di-
agonal elements, in particular, for positive deﬁnite Riema nnian metrics, long ago.
However the question is open for indeﬁnite inverse metrics h aving zeroes on diag-
onals. We propose the solution. Separable metrics are divid ed into equivalence
classes characterised by the number of Killing vector ﬁelds , quadratic indecompos-
ableconservation laws for geodesics, andthenumberof cois otropic coordinates. The
paper contains detailed proofs, sometimes new, of previous results as well as new
cases. As an example, we list all canonical separable metric s in each equivalence
class in two, three, and four dimensions. Thus the St¨ ackel p roblem is completely
solved for metrics of any signature in any number of dimensio ns.
1 Introduction
Many important and interesting problems in mathematical physics ar e related to analy-
sis of geodesics on a (pseudo)Riemannian manifold. In its turn, integ ration of geodesic
equations often reduces to solution of the corresponding Hamilton –Jacobi equation. Mod-
els admitting complete separation of variables in the Hamilton–Jacobi equations are of
particular interest because, in this case, there are nindependent conservation laws in
envolution for ndimensional Hamiltonian system, and geodesic equations are integra ted
in quadratures. Therefore ﬁnding metrics which admit complete sep aration of variables
is of great importance. This problem is interesting both for Riemannia n (positive deﬁ-
nite) metrics and metrics of Lorentz signature, the latter case be ing important in gravity
models.

1In 1891, St¨ ackel raised the question: “Which metrics admit comple te separation of
variables in the respective Hamilton–Jacobi equation?” [1, 2, 3, 4], and gave the answer in
thecaseofdiagonal(orthogonal)metricsinthepresence ofonlyq uadraticindecomposable
conservation laws. These metrics are called St¨ ackel or separable . The problem attracted
much interest of mathematicians and physicists and became classica l. It is clear that if
the metric has enough symmetry then it may admit nenvolutive conservation laws. At
the same time some St¨ ackel metrics admit complete separation of v ariables even without
any symmetry.
Manyinteresting andimportant results fororthogonalseparable metricswere obtained
in papers [5, 6, 7, 8], but we focus our attention on nondiagonal met rics.
The separating action functions were found for nondiagonal metr ics of arbitrary sig-
nature under the assumption that all diagonal elements diﬀer from zero in [9, 10, 11].
This is always true for Riemannian positive deﬁnite metrics. The corre sponding separa-
ble metrics were derived in [12, 13]. These results were culminated in [14 ] (see also [15])
were necessary and suﬃcient conditions for complete separation o f variables were found
for more general Hamiltonians depending on time and containing the t erm linear in mo-
menta and potential, again under the assumption that all diagonal e lements of separable
metrics diﬀer from zero.
A diﬀerent technique was used in [16, 17] (see also [18]) for obtaining separable met-
rics including the case when the diagonal inverse metric components include zeroes (the
corresponding coordinate lines were called there “essential coord inates of type I” and we
call them “coisotropic coordinates” for brevity). However the fu ll list of separating ac-
tion functions and conservation laws in Hamiltonian formulation was no t derived. This
general problem was also attacked in [19, 20] and many important ex amples especially
with coisotropic coordinates were considered in [21, 22]. In the pres ent paper, we solve
this problem using another technique which allows us not only to derive separable metrics
but, in addition, the full set of separating action functions and con servation laws in the
Hamiltonian formulation.
The coordinate free formulation of separability criteria in general c ase was proposed
in [23].
It turns out that St¨ ackel metrics and complete multiplicative sepa ration of variables
in the respective Laplace–Beltrami, Helmholtz, and Schr¨ odinger eq uations are closely re-
lated. Namely, complete multiplicative separation of variables in the lat ter equations pro-
vides suﬃcient conditions for complete additive separation of variab les in the Hamilton–
Jacobi equation [12, 13]. This observation increases the importanc e of separable metrics.
Separable metrics of Lorentzian signature are of great importanc e in gravity models.
Usually, one assumes existence of a largesymmetry groupfor metr ic to reduce the number
of independent components which allows to obtain exact solutions of Einstein’s equations
in many cases. As a rule, such solutions admit complete separation of variables in the
geodesic Hamilton–Jacobi equation. This approach can be inverted . One may assume
complete separability ofmetricwhich alsoreduces signiﬁcantly thenu mber ofindependent
metric components yielding a hope of obtaining exact solutions of gra vity equations.
Such solutions are very attractive because the respective geode sic equations are Liouville
integrable, andthishelpsustounderstandglobalstructureofre spectivespace-times. This
ideawassuccessfullyimplementedin[24]forseparablemetricsadmitt ingtwocommutative
Killing vector ﬁelds and two indecomposable quadratic conservation la ws. A large class of
exact solutions was described in this way including Schwarzschild, Reis sner–Nordstr¨ om,
2Kerr, and many others.
It turns out that all nonzero components of separable metrics ar e given by ﬁxed func-
tions of the set of arbitrary functions of single coordinates. This m eans that vacuum
Einstein’s equations reduce to a system of nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations. This
feature enhances the hope of obtaining exact solutions.
Complete separation of variables for the geodesic Hamilton–Jacobi equation occurs in
the presence of Killing vectors and Killing second rank tensors. The im portance of second
rank Killing tensors for linear Hamiltonian systems is discussed in [25]. So me topological
properties of complete separation of variables for Killing tensors ar e discussed in [26].
In the present paper, we propose complete solution of the St¨ ack el problem for metrics
of any signature in any dimensions including cases of zero diagonal inv erse metric com-
ponents. Our proofs in many cases diﬀer from others. At the end o f the paper, we give
complete lists of canonical separable metrics in two, three, and fou r dimensions.
2 Separation of variables
We consider n-dimensional topologically trivial manifold M≈Rncovered by a global
coordinate system xα,α= 1,...,n. Let there be a geodesic Hamiltonian (function on the
phase space ( x,p)∈T∗(M))
H0(x,p) :=1
2gαβ(x)pαpβ, (1)
wheregαβ(x) is the inverse metric on Mandpαare momenta. It is well known that it
yields Hamiltonian equations for geodesics on a (pseudo)Riemannian m anifold (M,g). All
functions are assumed to be suﬃciently smooth, and we shall not me ntion this in what
follows. Moreover we often say simply “metric” instead of “inverse m etric”.
If metric is positive deﬁnite then Hamiltonian (1) describes motion of a point particle
on Riemannian manifold ( M,g). For Lorentzian signature metric, Hamiltonian (1) descri-
bes worldlines of point particles on space-time ( M,g). Both cases are of considerable
interest from mathematical and physical points of view, and many p roperties of such
mechanical systems do not depend on the signature of the metric. We shall consider
metrics of arbitrary signature, transition to positive deﬁnite metr ic being usually trivial.
TheHamilton–Jacobiequationforthetruncatedactionfunction( characteristicHamil-
ton function) W(x) is
H0/parenleftbigg
x,∂W
∂xα/parenrightbigg
=1
2gαβ∂αW∂βW=E, E =const. (2)
Deﬁnition. A solution of Hamilton–Jacobi equation (2) W(x,c) depending on ninde-
pendent parameters (integration constants) ( ca)∈V⊂Rn,a= 1,...,n, such that
det∂2W
∂xα∂ca/ne}ationslash= 0, (3)
is called complete integral .
It is not a general solution of Eq.(2) which has functional arbitrarin ess. However any
solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation can be obtained from a com plete integral by
3variation of parameters (see, e.g., [27], Ch. IX, §3). Therefore, if complete integral is
known, then the problem may be considered as solved.
Note that there are inﬁnitely many complete integrals of the Hamilton –Jacobi equa-
tion, if they exist. Therefore our aim is not to ﬁnd all complete integr als but only one.
The domain c∈Vdepends on the metric and therefore is not speciﬁed. It should be
found in every particular case, and requires some investigation. In general, constant E(c)
(energy) in the Hamilton–Jacobi equation depends on parameters . In particular, it can
be considered as one of them.
It is clear that any solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is deﬁne d up to addition
of arbitrary constant. This constant cannot be chosen as one of the parameters cbecause
condition(3)isviolated. Thereforealladditive integrationconstan tsofWwillbedropped
as inessential.
We use Latin indices a,b,...for enumeration of independent parameters cthough
they run the same values as the Greek ones. This is done to stress im portant diﬀerence:
tensor components with Greek indices are transformed under coo rdinate transformation
whereas with Latin indices are not. For example, functions ∂aW:=∂W/∂c aare scalars
while partial derivatives ∂αW:=∂W/∂xαare components of covector.
Deﬁnition. Coordinates xα, if they exist, are called separable , if Hamilton–Jacobi equa-
tion (2) admits additive separation of variables in this coordinate sys tem, i.e. the action
function is given by the sum
W=n/summationdisplay
α=1Wα(xα,c) (4)
where every summand Wαis a function of only one coordinate xαand parameters ca,
taking values in some domain V⊂Rn. We require
det∂2W
∂xα∂ca= det∂2Wα
∂xα∂ca/ne}ationslash= 0 (5)
for allxandc. Metric in separable coordinate system is called separable . Functions Wα
in the sum (4) are called separating .
Individual summand in the action function (4) may depend only on som e part of
parameters, but the whole action function depends on all nparameters.
For brevity, we use notation
∂aW:=∂W
∂ca, W′
α(xα,c) :=∂αWα(xα,c).
Then requirement (5) is written as
det(∂aW′
α)/ne}ationslash= 0. (6)
The problem of complete separation of variables in Hamilton–Jacobi e quation (2) is
as follows. We have to describe all metrics gαβ(x), depending only on coordinates x,
for which there is a constant E(c)/ne}ationslash= 0 and functions W′
α(xα,c), depending on only one
coordinate xαand parameters csuch that det ∂aW′
α/ne}ationslash= 0 and equation
gαβW′
αW′
β= 2E (7)
4holds. During solution of this problem we ﬁnd admissible form of separa ting functions W′
α
which, as we shall see, deﬁne independent envolutive conservation laws in the correspond-
ing Hamiltonian systems. Thus, we have to solve functional (not diﬀe rential) equation
(7) with respect to gαβ(x) andW′
α(xα,c), which are supposed suﬃciently smooth both on
xandc.
All functions Wαis the sum (4) are scalars with respect to coordinate transformat ions
onMthough they have the coordinate index α. Covector is deﬁned by partial derivatives
W′
α:=∂αWα. If the Hamilton–Jacobi equation admits complete separation of va riables,
then the corresponding Hamiltonian equations are Liouville integrable , the solution being
given in quadratures. Requirement (6) means that nfunctions Wαare functionally inde-
pendent and can be chosen as new coordinates. These are the act ion-angle coordinates in
the corresponding Hamiltonian formulation.
Consider an important example of mechanical system in which metric h as no Killing
vectors but admit complete separation of variables in the Hamilton–J acobi equation.
Example 2.1 (The Liouville system). Consider a conformally ﬂat metric
gαβ= Φ2ηαβ⇔gαβ:=1
Φ2ηαβ,Φ2:=φ1+...+φn>0, (8)
where every function φα(xα) (no summation) depends on single coordinate, and ηαβde-
notes (pseudo)Euclidean metric of arbitrary signature. This metr ic deﬁnes the Hamilto-
nian
H:=ηαβpαpβ

Here we added potential energy Uof special type for generality
U:=Θ2
Φ2=θ1(x1)+...+θn(xn)
φ1(x1)+...+φn(xn),
every function θα(xα) being depended on single coordinate. Hamiltonian equations of
motion are

were the dot denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to the evolution p arameter τ∈R(time),
and summation on lower indices αis absent. Here and in what follows, we denote this
circumstance by special symbol ns(α) on the right of equations for brevity. Summation
over other repeated indices is performed as usual. The correspon ding Lagrangian is
L:=pα˙xα−H=φ1+...+φn
2ηαβ˙xα˙xβ−θ1+...+θn
φ1+...+φn.
Sure, energy Efor every trajectory is conserved,
E:=H/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

5Multiply Hamilton–Jacobi equation (7) by the conformal factor:

Separation of variables for the Liouville system happens in the way

The action function has the form

.
Certainly, the radicand is assumed to be positive. This complete integ ral satisﬁes the
Hamilton–Jacobi equation multiplied by the conformal factor:
δαβ∂αW∂βW= 2EΦ2, (12)
where multipliers ηααare included in the action function W.
In the Hamiltonian formalism, we have nquadratic conservation laws
ηααp2
α+2θα−2Eφα=cα. (13)
This can be easily checked by straightforward computation:
˙cα= 2ηααpα˙pα+2˙θα−2E˙φα=ηααpα2H∂αφα
Φ2−2E˙xα∂αφα=ηααpα2(H−E)
Φ2∂αφα= 0,
becauseH=Ealongevery trajectory. Fornontrivial functions θandφthese conservation
laws are indecomposable, parameters satisfying the condition c1+...+cn= 0. Indeed,
sum all conservation laws (13) taking into account the deﬁnition of H amiltonian (9):
c1+...+cn= (2H−2E)(φ1+...+φn) = 0. (14)
This is the sole relation between parameters. It shows that only n−1 conservation laws
among (11) are independent. The last independent conservation la w is also quadratic

It depends on all momenta and coordinates. The complete set of ind ependent parameters
is, for example, c1,...,c n−1,2E.
Thus, all canonical pairs of variables are separated. The particula r feature of this sep-
aration is that conformally ﬂat metric (8) has no Killing vector for non constant functions
φα(xα). Besides, variableswereseparatedonlyaftermultiplicationofthe Hamilton–Jacobi
equation by the conformal factor. Separation of variables for th e Liouville system does
not depend on the metric signature.
63 Separation of variables and Hamiltonian formalism
Inthissection, weshowwhathappensinHamiltonianformalismforcom pleteseparationof
variables in the Hamilton–Jacobi equation. Remind that we are consid ering Hamiltonian
(1) yielding equations of motion
˙xα=[xα,H0] =gαβpβ,
˙pα=[pα,H0] =1
2∂αgβγpβpγ.(16)
Suppose that relations
Gα(xα,pα,c) :=pα−W′
α(xα,c) = 0,∀α, ns(α),(17)
hold, where ( W′
α) is an arbitrary solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation (7) depen ding
onnindependent parameters. Due to inequality (6), these equations c an be locally solved
with respect to c:
ca=Fa(x,p), (18)
whereFaare some functions on canonical variables x,ponly.
Theorem 3.1. Relations (18) hold along every trajectory of the Hamiltoni an system.
These ﬁrst integrals of Hamiltonian equations are in involu tion.
Proof.Compute
˙ca=∂Fa
∂xα˙xα+∂Fa
∂pα˙pα. (19)
To ﬁnd partial derivatives of functions Fa, we do the following. Take the diﬀerential of
Eq.(17):
dpα−∂αW′
αdxα−∂aW′
αdca= 0, ns(α).
These equations can be solved with respect to dca:
dca=n/summationdisplay
α=1(∂aW′
α)−1/parenleftbig
dpα−∂αW′
αdxα/parenrightbig
, (20)
because of inequality (6). On the other hand, the diﬀerential of Eq .(18) yields
dca=∂Fa
∂xαdxα+∂Fa
∂pαdpα.
Comparing Eqs.(19) and (20), we conclude that
∂Fa
∂xα=−(∂aW′
α)−1∂αW′
α,∂Fa
∂pα= (∂aW′
α)−1, ns(α).
Now Eq.(19) yields:

evolution parameter τ.
On the other hand, diﬀerentiate Hamilton–Jacobi equation (7) with respect to xγ:

α=−∂γgδǫpδpǫ+2pγ∂γW′
γ= 0,
where Eq.(17) is used. Therefore ˙ ca= 0, and the ﬁrst statement of the theorem is proved.
Now compute the Poisson bracket of two conservation laws with indic esa/ne}ationslash=b

= 0.
This proves that conservation laws are in involution.
We see that, if variables are completely separated in the Hamilton–Ja cobi equation,
then the corresponding Hamiltonian system admits nindependent conservation laws (18)
which are in involution, and, consequently, it is Liouville integrable. This statement is
proved for the geodesic Hamiltonian H0. Moreover, it is valid in a general case.
Ifsummands W′
α(xα,c) arefound, then conservationlaws (18)areobtainedby solution
of Eqs. (17) with respect to parameters in explicit form. Luckily, th is can be always done
for geodesic Hamiltonian.
If a complete integral of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is known, th en one can always
go to the action-angle coordinates at least implicitly.
Theorem 3.2. Let us perform the canonical transformation (x,p)/ma√sto→(X,P)with generat-
ing function S2(x,P) :=W(x,P), where momenta are substituted instead of parameters:
(ca)/ma√sto→(Pa). Then Hamiltonian equations for new variables take the form
˙Xa=∂H
∂Pa=∂H
∂pα∂a∂αW,
˙Pa=0,⇒Pa=ca=const,(21)
where the substitution x=x(X,P)andp=p(X,P)is performed on the right hand side.
Proof.If the generating function of the canonical transformation depe nds on old coordi-
nates and new momenta, then old momenta and new coordinates are given by formulae
(see, e.g., [28])
pα=∂αW, Xa=∂aW. (22)
The last equality can be solved with respect to old coordinates at leas t locally due to
inequality (3), and we ﬁnd x=x(X,P). Substitution of this solution in the ﬁrst equality
deﬁnesp=p(X,P).
Take the diﬀerential of Eqs. (22):
dpα=∂2
αβWdxα+∂a∂αWdPa,
dXa=∂a∂αWdxα+∂a∂bWdPb.(23)
8This deﬁnes diﬀerentials
dxα=(∂a∂αW)−1(dXa−∂a∂bWdPb),

αβW(∂a∂αW)−1dXa+/bracketleftbig
∂a∂αW−∂2

Consequently, partial derivatives are
∂xα
∂Xa=(∂a∂αW)−1,
∂xα
∂Pa=−(∂b∂αW)−1∂a∂bW,
∂pα
∂Xa=∂2
αβW(∂a∂βW)−1,
∂pα
∂Pa=∂a∂αW−∂2
αβW(∂b∂βW)−1∂a∂bW.(25)
On the other hand the Hamilton–Jacobi equation implies
H/parenleftbigg
x,∂W(x,P)
∂x/parenrightbigg
= 2E(P).
Diﬀerentiate this equality by xα:
∂H
∂xα+∂H
∂pβ∂pβ
∂xα=∂H
∂xα+∂H
∂pβ∂αβW= 0. (26)
Now we see that equalities
∂H
∂Xa≡0,∂H
∂Pa=∂H
∂pα∂a∂αW,
hold where H=H/parenleftbig
x(X,P),p(X,P)/parenrightbig
.
Separable coordinates, when they exist, are not uniquely deﬁned, and there is a func-
tional arbitrariness related to coordinate transformations. To is olate it, we give
Deﬁnition. Two separable coordinate systems xandXonMareequivalent , if there
is a canonical transformation ( x,p)/ma√sto→(X,P) of respective Hamiltonian systems, such
that new coordinates X(x) depend only on old ones but not on momenta p. Moreover,
separable coordinate systems are equivalent in case when paramet ers are related by non-
degenerate transformation c/ma√sto→˜c(c) which do not involve coordinates. Manifold Mwith
metricgwhich admits separable coordinates for Eq. (2) in some neighbourho od of each
point related by this equivalence relation in overlapping domains is called St¨ ackel.
Righthandsides ofconservation laws (18) arescalars under canon ical transformations:

x(X),p(X,P)/parenrightbig
.
Conservation laws are transformed into conservation laws andthe ir involution survives
under arbitrarycanonical transformationbecause thelatter pr eserves the Poisson bracket.
We shall use canonical transformations in what follows to bring sepa rable metrics to the
most simple (canonical) forms and eliminate inessential functions.
9There may occur inequivalent separable coordinate systems for on e and the same
metric. In next sections, we obtain necessary and suﬃcient condit ions for existence of
separable coordinate systems and present explicit form of canonic al separable metrics in
each class of equivalent separable metrics. Before solution of the S t¨ ackel problem, we
consider the simple instructive example.
Example 3.1. Consider Euclidean space Rnwith metric δab,a,b= 1,...,nin Cartesian
coordinates ya. The Hamilton–Jacobi equation
δabW′
aW′
b= 2E
admits complete separation of variables
W′
a=ca=const,
the energy 2 E=cacabeing the dependent parameter. The action function is
W=yaca, (27)
where we dropped inessential additive integration constant. It de pends on nindependent
parameters c1,...,c n. Consequently, action function (27) is the complete integral of th e
Hamilton–Jacobi equation, and the problem is solved. Complete sepa ration of variables
(27) implies nconservation laws in the Hamiltonian formulation:
pa=ca,
which means conservation of all momenta. We see that Cartesian co ordinate system in
Euclidean space is separable. Vector ﬁelds ∂aare Killing vector ﬁelds. At the same time
most of curvilinear coordinates in Rnare not separable.
Indeed, let us go to curvilinear coordinates ya/ma√sto→xα(y),α= 1,...,n. Then inverse
functions ya(x) deﬁne vielbein (Jacobi matrices) and functions W′
α(x,c) are
W′
α=eαaca, e αa:=∂αya,
because they are covector components. It is necessary and suﬃ cient for new coordinates
to be separable that vielbein components eαa(xα) depend only on one coordinate xα. It
means that transition functions must be speciﬁc
ya=n/summationdisplay
α=1kαa(xα),
where all elements of each row of the matrix kαadepend only on one coordinate xα. Then
the vielbein is
eαa(xα) =∂αkαa=:k′
αa
with the sole condition det k′
αa/ne}ationslash= 0. Now we compute metric gαβ, and variables in the
Hamilton–Jacobi equation are separated:
W=n/summationdisplay
α=1Wα, W α:=/integraldisplay
dxαeαa(xα)ca, ns(α).
10In the Hamiltonian formulation, we have nindependent conservation laws:
pαeα
a(x) =ca.
Note that the inverse vielbein components eαa(x), in general, depend on all coordinates.
After the inverse transformation xα/ma√sto→ya, the conservation laws take simple form
pa=cawhich correspond to ncommuting Killing vectors ∂a(translations along Cartesian
coordinates).
All coordinate systems obtained in this way and only they (this will be p roved in
section 4) are equivalent. To see this, we make canonical transfor mation ( xα,pα)/ma√sto→
(ya,pa) with generating function depending on old coordinates and new mom enta
S2(xα,pa) :=n/summationdisplay
α=1kαa(xα)pa.
Then
pα=∂S2
∂xα=k′
αapa=eαapa, ya=∂S2
∂pa=n/summationdisplay
α=1kαa, (28)
and we are led to previous formulae. Thus, if we solve functional equ ation (7), then
its general solution contains many arbitrary functions. In our cas e, there are n2inessen-
tial functions kαa(xα) describing transformations between equivalent separable coord inate
systems. We see that the problem can be essentially simpliﬁed by makin g canonical trans-
formations. Therefore it is suﬃcient to choose the most simple sepa rable metric in each
classofequivalent metricswhichiscalledcanonical. Inthepresent ca se, itistheEuclidean
metric, all other equivalent separable metrics are related to it by su itable canonical trans-
formation. We note that transformation of momenta (28) is linear. Therefore linear and
quadratic conservation laws are transformed into linear and quadr atic ones, respectively.
At the same time, separation of variables in Euclidean space may happ en in a diﬀerent
way. Consider Euclidean plane in polar coordinates ( ya) = (r,ϕ)∈R2. In Cartesian
coordinates, we have two linear conservation laws
p1=c1, p 2=c2,
corresponding to two commuting Killing vectors ∂1and∂2. In polar coordinates,
x:=y1=rcosϕ, y :=y2=rsinϕ.

r2= 2E,
These are conservation of angular momentum and energy. Thus va riables are also sepa-
rated in polar coordinates, but now we have one linear and one indeco mposable quadratic
conservation laws.
Though variables are separated both in Cartesian and polar coordin ates, these coordi-
nate systems are not equivalent in the sense of our deﬁnition. Inde ed, the transformation
of coordinate does exist but it is not canonical because conservat ion laws do not transform
into conservation laws.
In polar and Cartesian coordinates, parameters ( E,cϕ) and (c1,c2) constitute full sets
of parameters, respectively, for the complete action functions. We have 2 E=c2
1+c2
2, but
parameter cϕcannot be expressed entirely through c1andc2. Really, momenta in polar
and Cartesian coordinates are related by transformation
pr= cosϕp1+sinϕp2, p ϕ=−rsinϕp1+rcosϕp2.
It implies expression for the angular parameter
cϕ=−rsinϕc1+rcosϕc2=−yc1+xc2.
That is transformation of parameters ( c1,c2)/ma√sto→(E,cϕ,x,y) necessarily include coor-
dinates. We see that transformation between full sets of indepen dent parameters may
include coordinates, and separation of variables does depend on ou r choice.
Considered examples teach us the following. First, a general solutio n of the St¨ ackel
problem contains many functions parameterizing transformations between equivalent sep-
arable coordinate systems. In conﬁguration space we have ordina ry coordinate trans-
formations which do not alter geometric invariants, e.g. scalar curv ature or squares of
curvature tensor. These functions are inessential, and can be elim inated by suitable
canonical transformation. Note that these transformations do not exhaust the whole
group of diﬀeomorphisms. Second, transformation of one full set of parameters to the
other (ca)/ma√sto→(˜ca,x) may include coordinates. In this case, separation of variables hold s
diﬀerently, and corresponding separable coordinates are not equ ivalent.
4 Linear conservation laws
Example3.1showsthatseparationofvariablesandconservationlaw sdependonthechoice
of complete set of parameters. The right hand side of the Hamilton– Jacobi equation (7)
12depends on one constant Ewhich therefore is distinguished. In this section, we choose
“symmetric” set of independent parameters which does not include E. This is done as
follows.
Fix a point p∈Mand introduce parameters
ca:=W′
α=a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p.
Here we change indices into Latin ones, α/ma√sto→ato stress that the set of parameters ( ca)
after coordinatetransformationsismultiplied by theinverse Jacob i matrixata ﬁxed point
p. The Hamilton–Jacobi equation at this point is
gabcacb= 2E, gab:=gαβ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p,α=a,β=b,
where subscript pmeans restriction of metric to this point. That is E(c) becomes the
dependent parameter. Now we choose the collection ( ca),a= 1,...,n, as the complete
set of independent parameters. Moreover metric gabat point pcan be transformed into
diagonal form with ±1 on the diagonal depending on the signature of the metric by
suitable linear coordinate transformation. Denote this matrix by
ηab:=diag(1,...,1,/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
r−1,...,−1/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
s), r+s=n, (30)
where the pair ( r,s) designates the signature of the metric. Then the Hamilton–Jacob i
equation takes the “symmetrical” form
gαβW′
αW′
β=ηabcacb, (31)
where each function W′
α(xα,c) depends on single coordinate xαand, probably, on the full
set of parameters c. The left hand side of this equation is a geometric invariant. Therefo re
we can regard metric components gαβand functions W′
αas transforming by usual tensor
transformation rules under coordinate changes while all quantities with Latin indices
remain unchanged.
The geometric meaning of this set of parameters is as follows. One an d only one
geodesic goes through each point pin every direction. Therefore the set of parameters
(xp,c) yields the Cauchy data and uniquely deﬁnes geodesic line in some neigh borhood of
pointp. In the Hamiltonian formulation, the set ( ca) represent momenta at a ﬁxed point
p.
Now we derive necessary and suﬃcient conditions for complete sepa ration of variables
for “symmetric” choice of parameters in Hamilton–Jacobi equation (31). There is a global
vielbeineαa(x) on every topologically trivial manifold M≈Rn:
gαβ=eα
aeβ
bηab,
which is deﬁned up to local O(r,s) (pseudo)rotations which include coordinate reﬂections.
The inverse vielbein is denoted by eαa(eαbeβb=δβ
α,eαaeαb=δa
b). Then Eq. (31) is
rewritten as
ηabW′
aW′
b=ηabcacb, W′
a:=eα
aW′
α.
It implies that covectors W′
aandcaare necessarily related by some (pseudo)rotational
matrixS∈O(r,s):
W′
a(x) =Sab(x)cb.
13multiply this expression by inverse vielbein eαaand obtain
W′
α= ˜eαaca,where ˜ eαa:=eαbSba.
For complete separation of variables in the Hamilton–Jacobi equatio n, it is necessary and
suﬃcient that the right hand side of this relation depends solely on xα. Drop the tilde
sign and formulate the result.
Theorem 4.1. Variables in Hamilton–Jacobi equation (31) with ”symmetri c“ set of in-
dependent parameters (ca)are completely separated if and only if there exists the viel bein
eαa(xα)such that its components with ﬁxed αdepend solely on one coordinate xαfor all
values of index a. Then every term in action function (4) is a primitive
Wα(xα,c) :=/integraldisplay
dxαeαa(xα)ca, ns(α). (32)
In the Hamiltonian formulation, there are nlinear in momenta conservation laws
eα
a(x)pα=ca (33)
for alla.
Corollary. Covariant components of the separable metric for Hamilton–Jacob i equation
(31)
gαβ(xα,xβ) =eαa(xα)eβb(xβ)ηab
depend only on two coordinates.
The proof is evident. Sure, components of the inverse metric gαβ(x) and vielbein
eαa(x) depend on all coordinates in general. That is conservation laws (33 ) are linear in
momenta but depend on all coordinates.
Example 4.1. Complicate the problem considered in example 3.1. Suppose that rota -
tionally symmetric metric is given in polar coordinates on a plane ( r,ϕ)∈R2
gαβ=/parenleftbiggf20
0r2/parenrightbigg
, gαβ=/parenleftbigg1
f20

r2/parenrightbigg
, (34)
wheref(r)>0 is some function of radius only. Then the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in
polar coordinates is
W′2
r
f2+W′2
ϕ
r2= 2E,
and variables are completely separated:
W′
ϕ=cϕ,W′2
r
f2+c2
ϕ
r2= 2E.
Parameters cϕandE, as before, correspond to conservation of the angular momentu m
and the energy.
14Let us look what happens in Cartesian coordinates ( x,y)∈R2. In polar coordinates
vielbein can be chosen in diagonal form
eαa=/parenleftbigg
f0
0r/parenrightbigg
, eα
a=/parenleftbigg1
f0

r/parenrightbigg
.
In Cartesian coordinates it is written as
exa=/parenleftigx
rf,−y
r/parenrightig
, e ya=/parenleftigy
rf,x
r/parenrightig
.
Vielbein components exaexplicitly depend on y, and variables are not separated. Accord-
ing to theorem 4.1, separable coordinates exist if there is the vielbein
˜eαa=eαbSba, S ba=/parenleftbiggcosω−sinω
sinωcosω/parenrightbigg
∈SO(2),
whereω(x,y) is some rotational angle, such that vielbein components ˜ exa(x) and ˜eya(y)
depend only on xandy, respectively.
Proposition 4.1. Iff2≡/1, then there is no rotational matrix Ssuch that components
of the ﬁrst row of vielbein ˜exadepend solely on xfor alla= 1,2, and components of the
second row ˜eyadepend solely on y.
Proof.Two components of vielbein in Cartesian coordinates after the rota tion are
˜ex1=x
rfcosω−y
rsinω,
˜ex2=−x
rfsinω−y
rcosω.
Their independence on yis given by equations
∂y˜ex1=−xy
r3fcosω+xy
r2f′cosω−x
rfsinω∂yω−x2
r3sinω−y
rcosω∂yω= 0,(35)
∂y˜ex2=xy
r3fsinω−xy
r2f′sinω−x
rfcosω∂yω−x2
r3cosω+y
rsinω∂yω= 0,(36)
wheref′:=df/dr. Take the linear combination of theses equations
(35)sinω+(36)cos ω=−x
rf∂yω−x2
r3= 0 ⇒f∂yω=−x
r2
and substitute in Eq. (35). Finally, we obtain equation for f
rff′−f2+1 = 0.
Its general solution is
f2= 1+Cr2, C=const.
Now we write the independence of the second row of the vielbein on x,∂x˜eya= 0, and
make the same calculations as for Eqs. (35) and (36). Then we obta in
f∂xω=y
r2
15with the same function f. Consequently, the rotation angle is deﬁned by the system of
equation
∂xω=y
r2f, ∂ yω=−x
r2f.
It is easily checked that integrability conditions are not fulﬁlled for f2/ne}ationslash= 1, and therefore
function ω(x,y) does not exist. Therefore variables for metric (34) are separat ed in
Cartesian coordinates only for f2≡1.
Thus variables in the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for metric (34) are c ompletely sepa-
rated in polar coordinates but not in Cartesian. This is a natural res ult because metric
(34) is not translationally invariant.
The moral of this example is that if the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is no t separable
for ”symmetric“ choice of parameters, then it does not mean that separability does not
happen for other choices of independent parameters. Conseque ntly, theorem 4.1 does not
exhaust all possibilities of variable separations.
Conservation laws (33) can be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed by canonical tra nsformation
(xα,pα)/ma√sto→(Xa,Pa) with generating function depending on old coordinates ( xα) and new
momenta ( Pa)
S2:=n/summationdisplay
α=1Iα, I α:=/integraldisplay
dxαeαa(xα)Pa, ns(α),(37)
whereIαare primitives. Then
pα=∂S2
∂xα=eαaPa, Xa=∂S2
∂Pa=n/summationdisplay
α=1/integraldisplay
dxαeαa.
This is exactly the coordinate transformation ( xα)/ma√sto→/parenleftbig
Xa(x)/parenrightbig
. Indeed, the Jacobi matrix
is
∂αXa=eαa,
and momenta components are transformed as covariant vector. In new coordinates, the
Hamiltonian is
H0=1
2ηabPaPb.
It implies nindependent linear conservation laws
Pa=ca (38)
(all momenta are conserved). Since metric components are const ant in these coordinates
then there is the maximal number nof linearly independent commuting Killing vectors
∂aonM. In this way, we proved
Theorem 4.2. Variables in the Hamilton–Jacobi equation (31) with the “sy mmetric”
choice of parameters are completely separable if and only if there exist nlinearly indepen-
dent at each point commuting Killing vector ﬁelds on (M,g). Then there is a coordinate
system in which metric components are constant, and conserv ation laws have form (38).
16This result is not surprising. Indeed, if vielbein components eαa(xα) depend on single
coordinate xαfor alla, then curvature tensor vanishes. These calculations are most ea sily
performed in Cartan variables. The nonholonomicity components ar e identically zero
cαβa:=−∂αeβa+∂βeαa≡0.
Therefore the corresponding SO(r,s) connection is also zero, and, consequently, curvature
vanishes. Therefore manifold Mis locally (pseudo)Euclidean. This is enough for complete
separation of variables in Cartesian coordinates. Thus, if complete separation of variables
occursfor“symmetrical” choiceofindependent parameters, the nmanifold Misnecessarily
locally ﬂat.
5 Quadratic conservation laws and coisotropic coor-
dinates
Now we consider another possibility of complete variables separation of variables in the
Hamilton–Jacobi equation. Remember that our aim is not to ﬁnd all co mplete integrals,
which are inﬁnitely many, but to ﬁnd at least one of them for a given ty pe of separable
metric. Therefore our strategy is the following.
1. Describe all possible types of separable metrics.
2. Choose independent parameters.
3. Specify the class of separating functions in each case.
4. Solve the functional Hamilton–Jacobi equation.
5. Choose the canonical separable metric in every equivalence class , ﬁnd the complete
integral and the full set of conservation laws.
6. Prove that any additional conservation law is functionally depend ent on the full set
of previously obtained conservation laws at least locally.
First, we introduce notation, choose parameters, and prove the simple lemma which
is important for further analysis. Suppose that we have exactly 0 ≤n≤ncommuting
Killing vector ﬁelds and not more, and variables are nevertheless com pletely separated.
We assume that variables corresponding to Killing vectors are separ ated, and they are the
ﬁrstncoordinates. There areonlytwo possibilities left: diagonal compone nts of separable
metricscandiﬀerfromzeroorvanish, whichispossibleonlyforindeﬁn itemetrics. Assume
that the number of nonzero diagonal metric components is equal t o 0≤m≤n, and they
precede zero components. We shall see in what follows that the ineq uality
n−n−m≤n⇔2n+m≤n (39)
must hold, otherwise the metric becomes degenerate.
A curvexα(τ),τ∈Ris called isotropic if the tangent vector dxαis null, i.g. gαα≡0.
By analogy, we call the coordinate line coisotropic ifgαα≡0. Sure, coisotropic lines exist
only on pseudoriemannian manifolds. Thus the last n−n−mcoordinates are coisotropic.
17We shall see in what follows that the nonzero diagonal metric compon ents correspond to
indecomposable quadratic conservation laws.
Introduce notation. Divide all coordinates on three groups ( xα,yµ,zϕ)∈M, where
indices from the beginning, middle, and end of the Greek alphabet tak e the following
values:
α,β,...=1,...,n (commuting Killing vectors) ,
µ,ν,...=n+1,...,n+m(quadratic conservation laws , gµµ/ne}ationslash= 0),
ϕ,φ,...=n+m+1,...,n(coisotropic coordinates , gϕϕ≡0).(40)
In this way we described all possible types of separable metrics.
Suppose that all variables corresponding to Killing vector ﬁelds are s eparated, and the
ﬁrstncoordinates are chosen cyclic. Then the corresponding separatin g functions and
conservation laws are
W′
α=cαandpα=cα.
All parameters are also divided into three groups ( c,d,a). Parameters care already
introduced and parameters dandaare deﬁned as follows. In a ﬁxed point p∈M, we set
dii:=W′2
µ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p,µ=i, i=n+1,...,n+m,
ar:=W′
ϕ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
p,ϕ=r, r=n+m+1,...,n.(41)
which isalways possible. Forconvenience, weconsider parameters diiasdiagonalelements
of matrix d= (dij),dij= 0 fori/ne}ationslash=j(to preserve the number of independent parameters).
Sure, all diagonal elements are positive, dii>0. Parameters dfor quadratic conservation
laws and afor coisotropic coordinates are enumerated by Latin indices from t he middle
and end of the alphabet, respectively.
At a ﬁxed point p, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation becomes
gαβ
pcαcβ+2gαi
pcα/radicalbig
dii+2gαr
pcαar+gij
p/radicalbig
diidjj+2gir
p/radicalbig
diiar+grs
paras= 2E,
wheregrr= 0. Therefore parameters ( c,d,a) andEare simply related. Choose the
independent set of parameters in the following ways.
Case 1. Energy Ecorresponds to the coisotropic coordinate. Redeﬁne an:= 2E.
Then the set of independent parameters is
(cα,dij,an+m+1,...,a n−1n−1,an:= 2E). (42)
Case 2. Energy Ecorresponds to the indecomposable quadratic conservation law.
Redeﬁne dn+mn+m:= 2E. Then the set of independent parameters is
(cα,dn+1n+1,...,d n+m−1n+m−1,dn+mn+m:= 2E,ar). (43)
This is always possible because redeﬁnition of parameters ananddn+mn+mleads to
multiplication of separating functions W′
nandW′
n+mon some nonzero constants.
We are looking for solutions of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for sep arating functions
W′2
µandW′
ϕwithin the class functions linear in parameters danda:
W′2
µ:=bµµij(yµ,c)dij+bµµr(yµ,c)ar+kµµ(yµ,c)>0, (44)
W′
ϕ:=bϕij(zϕ,c)dij+bϕr(zϕ,c)ar+lϕ(zϕ,c), (45)
18wherebµµii(yµ,c),bµµr(yµ,c),bϕii(zϕ,c), andbϕr(zϕ,c) are some functions of single co-
ordinate and, possibly, the ﬁrst group of parameters c. We suppose that matrices bµµii
whose elements are enumerated by pairs of indices µµandii, andbϕrare nondegenerate.
This choice is justiﬁed by the result: the functional Hamilton–Jacob i equation has solu-
tion within this class of separating functions, and our aim is to ﬁnd at le ast one solution.
Then the Hamilton–Jacobi equation becomes
gαβcαcβ+2gαµcαW′
µ+2gαϕcαW′
ϕ+gµνW′
µW′
ν+2gµϕW′
µW′
ϕ+gϕφW′
ϕW′
φ= 2E.(46)
This equality must hold for all values of coordinates and parameters . For terms quadratic
ina, we have
gϕφbϕrbφsaras≡0⇒gϕφ≡0,
because matrix bϕris nondegenerate. That is the whole metric block for coisotropic
coordinates must be equal to zero: gϕφ≡0 for allϕandφ.
There are irrational function on don the left hand side of Eq. (46) which cannot be
cancelled. Therefore the equalities gαµ≡0 andgµϕ≡0 must hold. In addition block gµν
must be diagonal. Thus we have proved
Lemma 5.1. If independent parameters are chosen as in Eqs. (42) or (43) a nd separating
functions have form (44), (45), then separable metric has bl ock form
g∗∗=
gαβ(y,z) 0 gαφ(y,z)
0gµν(y,z) 0
gϕβ(y,z) 0 0
, (47)
where block gµνis diagonal, and the star takes all values: ∗:= (α,µ,ϕ).
In this way, three items of our strategy are met.
Weshallseeinwhatfollowsthatvariablesareseparateddiﬀerentlyd ependingonwhich
group of parameters contains energy E: eitheran= 2E(case 1), or dn+mn+m= 2E(case
2). Therefore each separable metric belongs to one of the equivale nce class [ n,m,n−
n−m]1,2, where the index shows the location of E, if it is considered as independent
parameter, i.e. if m/ne}ationslash= 0 and/or n−n−m/ne}ationslash= 0. All Riemannian positive deﬁnite metrics
belong to classes [ n,n−n,0]2.
One and the same metric in diﬀerent separable coordinates can be th e member of
diﬀerent classes. For example, the Euclidean metric on a plane in the C artesian and polar
coordinates belong to classes [2 ,0,0] and [1,1,0]2, respectively (see example 3.1).
In the Hamiltonian formalism, the complete variables separation leads tonindepen-
dent conservation laws in involution. For their derivation in explicit for m, we have to
replaceW′
µ/ma√sto→pµ,W′
r/ma√sto→prand solve equalities (44), (45) with respect to parameters dii
andar. This introduces some restrictions on matrix bwhich will be put later.
Now we solve functional Hamilton–Jacobi equation with respect to s eparating func-
tions and metric components for diﬀerent values of mandn.
5.1 Quadratic conservation laws
Suppose that variables in the Hamilton–Jacobi equation are complet ely separated, but
Killing vectors and coisotropic coordinates are absent. Then n= 0,m=n, and the
Hamilton–Jacobi equation is
gµνW′
µW′
ν= 2E, (48)
19where separating functions W′
µ(yµ,d) depend on single coordinate yµand, in a general
case, on all independent parameters
d:= (dij) =diag(d11,...,d n−1n−1,dnn:= 2E). (49)
Due to lemma 5.1 the separable metric must be diagonal. Separating fu nctions have the
form (44)
W′2
µ(yµ,d) =bµµij(yµ)dij>0, (50)
wherebµµii(yµ) is some invertible ( n×n)-matrix, whose rows depend on single coordinate,
and the inequalities restrict the form of matrix bfor given parameters d. Without loss of
generality, we assume
bµνij/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
i/negationslash=j≡0, b µνij/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
µ/negationslash=ν≡0, (51)
because the parameter matrix dijand metric gµνare diagonal.
Diﬀerentiate the Hamilton–Jacobi equation (48) with respect to all parameters. As
the result, we obtain the system of nlinear equations for ndiagonal metric components:

/ne}ationslash= 0. (53)
in our case. Consequently, the system of equations (52) has uniqu e solution.
To ﬁnd metric components, we substitute Eqs. (50) in the left hand side of the
Hamilton–Jacobi equation (48):
gµνbµνijdij= 2E. (54)
Sincednn= 2E, it implies that diagonal metric components are
gµµ=bnnµµ, (55)
wherebnnµµ(y) is the last row of the inverse matrix biiµµ:

whose elements depend on all coordinates in general. In addition, we must require that
all elements of the last row of matrix (55) diﬀer from zero, otherwis e the metric becomes
degenerate.

Integration constants in the last equalities are inessential becaus e the action function is
deﬁned up to a constant.
Equalities (50) imply nquadratic conservation laws
biiµνpµpν=dii (56)
in the Hamiltonian formulation. In general, the left hand side depends on all coordinates
and momenta. These conservation laws correspond to Killing tensor s of second rank.
Rewrite Eq. (56) in the form
p2
µ=bµµijdij.
It implies that quadratic conservation laws are indecomposable if and only if each row
of matrix bµµiicontains at least two nonzero and not proportional elements. Oth erwise,
the square root can be taken, and linear conservation law appears , which contradicts the
assumption on the absence of Killing vectors.
Thus we have proved
Theorem 5.1. If all diagonal inverse metric components diﬀer from zero, gµµ/ne}ationslash= 0,
and Killing vector ﬁelds and coisotropic components are abs ent, then there exist such
independent parameters (49) and separating functions (50) , that all conservation laws
are quadratic, and the Hamilton–Jacobi equation admits com plete separation of variables
if and only if when inverse metric gµνis diagonal with components (55), where biiµµis
the inverse matrix to an arbitrary nondegenerate matrix bµµii(yµ), whose rows depend
on single coordinate yµand contain at least two nonzero not proportional elements. In
addition, inequalities bnnµµ/ne}ationslash= 0must hold for all values of index µ, and arbitrary functions
bµµiimust be chosen in such a way that the system of equations for se parating functions
W′
µ(50) have real solutions for given values of parameters d.
Consequently, diagonalmetriccomponentsareparameterizedby n2arbitraryfunctions
onsinglecoordinate bµµii(yµ), satisfying threeconditions: det bµµii/ne}ationslash= 0,bnnµµ/ne}ationslash= 0forall µ,
and each row of matrix bµµiimust contain at least two nonzero not proportional elements.
Note that components of the inverse matrix biiµµ(y) depend on all coordinates in general.
In fact, we prove the following. The right hand sides of Eqs. (50) co ntain arbitrary
functions of single coordinates linear and homogeneous in d. Therefore the separable
metric is found for arbitrary indecomposable quadratic conservat ion laws. All restrictions
onarbitraryfunctions intheconservation lawsfollowfromnondege neracy ofthe separable
metric, indecomposability of the quadratic Killing tensors, and existe nce of solutions for
separating functions W′
µin Eqs. (50).
IntheHamiltonianformulation, wehave ninvolutive quadraticconservationlaws(56).
Consequently, the Hamiltonian system is Liouville integrable.

If, for example, d11>0andE >0, then
φ12>−d11
2E, φ 22>d11
2E.
Consequently this example is the particular two dimensiona l case of the Liouville system
for Riemannian metric considered in example 2.1.
22Now put φ11≡ −1andφ21≡ −1. Then
bµµii:=/parenleftbigg
−1φ12(y1)
−1φ22(y2)/parenrightbigg
⇒biiµµ:=1
φ12−φ22/parenleftbigg
φ22−φ12

.
These matrices imply conformally Lorentzian metric
gµν=1
φ12−φ22/parenleftbigg
1 0
0−1/parenrightbigg
. (62)
The respective Hamilton–Jacobi equation is
W′2
1−W′2
2= 2E(φ12−φ22),
and variables are separated:
W′2
1=−d11+2Eφ12, W′2
2=−d11+2Eφ22.
They are indecomposable for d11/ne}ationslash= 0,E/ne}ationslash= 0, and nonconstant functions φ12,φ22. The
conservation laws are quadratic:
1
φ12−φ22/parenleftbig

2/parenrightbig
=d11,1
φ12−φ22/parenleftbig
p2

= 2E. (63)
The parameter domain of deﬁnition and the form of arbitrary f unctions are deﬁned by
inequalities:
−d11+2Eφ12>0,−d11+2Eφ22>0.
IfE >0, then there are two possibilities when φ12−φ22/ne}ationslash= 0:
φ12> φ22>d11
2E, φ 22> φ12>d11
2E,
forg11>0andg11<0, respectively. This is also two-dimensional Liouville sys tem
considered in example 2.1 but for Lorentzian signature metr ic.
Letφ12≡0andφ21≡ −1. Then
bµµii:=/parenleftbigg
φ11(x) 0

⇒biiµµ:=1

.
The conditions of theorem 5.1 are not fulﬁlled because the ﬁr st row of matrix bµµiicontains
only one nonzero element. The respective inverse metric is
gµν=1
φ11φ22/parenleftbigg
1 0
0φ11/parenrightbigg
. (64)
The Hamilton–Jacobi equation for this metric
W′2
1+φ11W′2
2= 2Eφ11φ22,
admits complete separation of variables:
W′2
1=φ11d11, W′2
2=−d11+2Eφ22.
23The conservation laws are quadratic:
1
φ11φ22p2
1=d11,1
φ11φ22/parenleftbig
p2
1+φ11p2
2/parenrightbig
= 2E. (65)
The parameter domain of deﬁnition and admissible form of arb itrary functions are deﬁned
by inequalities:
φ11d11>0,−d11+2Eφ22>0.
Ford11>0andE >0, for example, they restrict arbitrary functions:
φ11>0, φ 22>d11
2E.
In this case the ﬁrst conservation law (65) is decomposable: it is the square of linear
conservation law p1/√φ11φ22=√d11. Consequently, we have in fact one linear and one
quadratic conservation law.
Now we simplify the form of matrix bµµiiusing the canonical transformation. It turns
out that one of nonzero elements in each row of matrix bµµiican be transformed to unity.
For example, let bµµii/ne}ationslash= 0 for given µandi. For deﬁniteness we assume that it is the
diagonal element, µ=i. Choose the generating function of canonical transformation fo r
one pair of canonically conjugate variables ( yµ,pµ)/ma√sto→(Yi,Pi) as
S2(y,P) :=/integraldisplay
dyµ/radicalig
|bµµii|Pi, ns(µ,i). (66)
Note that it must be linear in P, because otherwise the coordinate transformation x/ma√sto→
X(x) depends on momenta which contradicts the equivalence relation. T hen we get for
ﬁxedµ:
pµ=∂S2
∂yµ=/radicalig
|bµµii|Pi, Yi=∂S2
∂Pi=/integraldisplay
dyµ/radicalig
|bµµii|, ns(µ,i),
and Eq. (50) becomes
|bµµii|˜W′2
i=bµµiidii+/summationdisplay
j/negationslash=ibµµjjdjj
for transformed separating function ˜Wi. Dividing it by |bµµii|, we obtain the quadratic
equality
˜W′2
i=±dii+/summationdisplay
j/negationslash=i˜biijjdjj (67)
with some new functions ˜biijj(Yi). Similar transformation can be performed for each row.
So, without loss of generality, one of nonzero elements in each row c an be set to unity
because signs ±1 can be attributed to parameters d. It means that canonical separable
metric is parameterized by n2−nfunctions of single coordinates.
In fact, this statement is evident. Indeed, Eq. (50) depends only on single coordinate,
and one of nonzero elements can be transformed to ±1 by coordinate transformation
yµ/ma√sto→˜yµ(yµ).
245.2 Linear and quadratic conservation laws
Assume that metric admits exactly 1 ≤n< nand not more commuting Killing vec-
tor ﬁelds, and coisotropic coordinates are absent, n−n−m= 0. There is one linear
conservation law for each Killing vector. Then we need additional n−nindependent in-
volutive conservation laws to provide complete integrability. These c onservation laws are
quadratic as was shown in the preceeding section. Now we have two g roups of coordinates
(xα,yµ)∈Mand two groups of independent parameters candd(43). Separable metric
(47) in this case is block diagonal
g∗∗=/parenleftbigg
gαβ0
0gµν/parenrightbigg
, (68)
where the lower block gµνis diagonal.
Functions kinequality(44)mustbequadraticin castheconsequenceoftheHamilton–
Jacobi equation. Therefore separating functions are
W′2
µ=bµµijdij+kαβ
µµcαcβ>0, (69)
wherebµµii(yµ)issomenondegeneratematrixwhoseelements ineachrowdependo nsingle
coordinate corresponding to the number of the row, and function skαβ
µµ(yµ) are arbitrary
and symmetric in indices αandβbut can be nondiagonal in them. Their indices can be
written one under another because they will never be lowered or ra ised.
There is the new property. We shall see that the term kαβ
µµcαcβin Eq. (69) must not
vanish for nondegenerate metric. Therefore the requirement th at each row of matrix bµµii
contains at least two not proportional elements is unnecessary.
After separating the ﬁrst group of coordinates, the Hamilton–Ja cobi equation becomes
gαβcαcβ+gµν(bµνijdij+kαβ
µνcαcβ) = 2E, (70)
where matrix gµνis diagonal. We get previous expression (55) for elements in the seco nd
block because dnn:= 2E. Therefore
gαβcαcβ+gµνkαβ
µνcαcβ= 0. (71)
Thisequality must befulﬁlledforall c, anddeﬁnestheupper blockoftheinverse separable
metric (68):
gαβ=−kαβ
µνgµν, (72)
wherekαβ
µµ(yµ) are arbitrary functions on single coordinates providing nondegen eracy of
gαβand positivity of right hand sides of Eqs. (69). Thus we have proved
Theorem 5.2. If separable metric admits exactly 1≤n< nand not more commuting
Killing vector ﬁelds, and coisotropic coordinates are abse nt,n−n−m= 0, then there exists
such set of independent parameters (43) and separating func tions (69), that separable
inverse metric has block form (68). The lower block is diagon al with elements (55),
wherebiiµµ(y)is the matrix inverse to matrix bµµii(yµ)whose elements in each row depend
only on single coordinates, and all elements of the last row d iﬀer from zero, bnnµµ/ne}ationslash= 0.
The upper block has form (72) with arbitrary functions kαβ
µµ(yµ) =kβα
µµ(yµ)depending on
single coordinates. In addition, the upper block (71) must b e nondegenerate and provide
25positiveness of right hand sides of Eqs. (69). In the Hamilto nian formulation, there are
n−nindecomposable quadratic conservation laws:
pα=cα,
biiµν/parenleftbig
pµpν−kαβ
µνcαcβ/parenrightbig
=dii.(73)
Quadratic conservation laws (73) appear after contraction of Eq s. (69) with inverse
matrixbiiµµ.
Thus the canonical separable inverse metric of type [ n,n−n,0]2has block diagonal
form
g∗∗=/parenleftbigg−kαβ
µνgµν0
0gµν/parenrightbigg
, (74)
where the lower block gµνis diagonal (55), and stars denote all indices ∗= (α,µ).
We can also simplify matrix bµµiiusing canonical transformation (66) from previous
section. Therefore one of nonzero elements in each row of matrix bcan se set to unity
without loss of generality.
Example 5.2. Consider the simplest example, when separable metric admits only one
indecomposable quadratic conservation law, i.e. n=n−1 anddnn= 2E. In this case,
there is only one coordinate y, which may not be enumerated. Matrix bµµiiconsists of
only one element b(y)/ne}ationslash= 0, and its inverse is 1 /b. Due to theorem 5.2, the most general
canonical separable metric (74) is block diagonal:
g∗∗=/parenleftbigggαβ(y) 0

b(y)/parenrightbigg
=/parenleftigg
−kαβ(y)1
b(y)0

, α,β = 1,...,n−1,(75)
where the ( n−1)×(n−1) block gαβ(y) can be arbitrary nondegenerate matrix if we
include arbitrary function b(y)/ne}ationslash= 0 in the deﬁnition of kαβ(y). Variables are separated as
W′
α=cα, W′2
n= 2Eb+kαβcαcβ>0,
where the inequality restricts functions bandkfor ﬁxed Eandc. The respective conser-
vation laws are
pα=cα,1
b/parenleftbig
p2
n−kαβcαcβ/parenrightbig
= 2E. (76)
To simplify metric (75) we perform the canonical transformation ( y,pn)/ma√sto→(Y,Pn)
with the generating function
S2:=/integraldisplay
dy/radicalbig
|b(y)|Pn,
leaving remaining variables xα,pαuntouched. Then
pn=∂S2
∂y=/radicalbig
|b|Pn, Y=∂S2
∂Pn=/integraldisplay
dy/radicalbig
|b|,
and the quadratic conservation law takes the form
±P2
n+gαβcαcβ= 2E,
After this transformation of variables, the canonical separable m etric becomes
g∗∗=/parenleftbigg
gαβ(y) 0
0±1/parenrightbigg
, (77)
where the sign choice depends on the signature of the metric.
265.3 Coisotropic coordinates
We showed in section 4 that linear conservation laws for the “symmet ric” choice of inde-
pendent parameters correspond to Killing vector ﬁelds. However, if energy Ein the right
hand side of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is considered as independ ent parameter, linear
conservation laws not related to Killing vectors may appear. This pos sibility arises only
for indeﬁnite metrics having coisotropic coordinates. For Riemannia n positive deﬁnite
metrics linear conservation laws are always related to Killing vector ﬁe lds.
Existence of these linear conservation laws can take place only when suﬃcient number
of commuting Killing vectors are simultaneously present. Suppose th atm= 0, i.e. we
have only Killing vector ﬁelds and coisotropic coordinates. then we ha ve two groups of
coordinates ( xα,zϕ)∈M, where indices take the following values
α,β,...= 1,...,n;ϕ,φ,...=n+1,...,n;n
2≤n< n. (78)
By assumption, there are independent parameters
{c1,...,c n,an+1,...,a n−1,an:= 2E}. (79)
Separable metric of type [ n,0,n−n]1has block form (47)
g∗∗=/parenleftbigggαβ(z)gαφ(z)
gϕβ(z) 0/parenrightbigg
. (80)
This metric must be nondegenerate, therefore the number of Killing vectors cannot be
less then the number of coisotropic coordinates
n≥n−n⇔n≥n
2, (81)
which wasassumed at thevery beginning (78). Inaddition, therank ofrectangularmatrix
gαφis equal to n−n, otherwise separable metric is degenerate.
After separation of cyclic coordinates condition (6) becomes
det/parenleftbig
∂rW′
ϕ/parenrightbig
/ne}ationslash= 0, (82)
and Hamilton–Jacobi equation (7) for metric (80) takes the form
gαβcαcβ+2gαϕcαW′
ϕ= 2E. (83)
Separating functions W′
ϕ(45) are linear in parameters a:
W′
ϕ=bϕr(zϕ,c)ar+lϕ(zϕ,c), (84)
wherebϕris some nondegenerate matrix, whose elements in each row depend o nly on
single coordinate zϕand, possibly, on the ﬁrst group of parameters ( cα), andlϕare some
functions also on single coordinate and ﬁrst group of parameters. Equating terms with E
in Eq. (83), we obtain
2gαϕcα=bnϕ, (85)
27wherebnϕis the last row of matrix brϕ, which is inverse to bϕr:brϕbφr=δϕ
φ. This equality
implies that the last row of matrix bnϕ(z,c), whose elements depend in general on all
coordinates z, are linear in cα. Let
bnϕ:=bnαϕcα, (86)
wherebnαϕ(z) is a set of arbitrary functions on z, such that matrix ( brαϕcα) is not degen-
erate. Equality (85) must hold for all values of cα, therefore
2gαϕ=bnαϕ. (87)
Now we substitute the expression for separating functions W′
ϕ(84) and use Eq. (85) in
the Hamilton–Jacobi equation (83):
gαβcαcβ+bnαϕcαlϕ= 0. (88)
It implies that functions lϕare linear and homogeneous in cα:
lϕ=lα
ϕ(zϕ)cα, (89)
wherelα
ϕ(zϕ) are some functions depending on single coordinate. Indices here c an be
written one over the other because they will be never raised or lowe red. Then Eq. (88)
deﬁnes the square block for Killing vectors
2gαβ=−bnαϕlβ
ϕ−bnβϕlα
ϕ. (90)
Thus Hamilton–Jacobi equation (83) is solved, and the separable me tric is
g∗∗=1

−bnαχlβ
χ−bnβχlα
χbnαφ
bnβϕ0/parenrightigg
, (91)
where the star denotes all indices, ∗= (α,ϕ).
To simplify the separable metric, we perform the canonical transfo rmation with gen-
erating function
S2:=xαPα+zϕPϕ+n/summationdisplay
ϕ=n+1/integraldisplay
dzϕlα
ϕ(zϕ)Pα. (92)

The metric transforms as follows g∗∗/ma√sto→˜g∗∗with
˜gαβ= 0,˜gαφ=gαφ,˜gϕφ= 0,
28where equality gϕφ≡0 was used. After this transformation the separable metric is

This metric is always degenerate except for n= 2n. Then

Nowweareleft withtheproblemtoﬁndsuchmatrix bϕr(z,c) inEq. (84), thatequality
(87) be satisﬁed for all coordinates zand parameters c. In other words we have to extract
explicitly the dependence of matrix elements bϕronparameters, because Eq. (86) contains
elements of the inverse metric.
Proposition 5.1. Matrix elements (bϕr)in Eq. (84) satisfying equality (87) must have
the form
bϕr(zϕ,c) =φϕr
hαϕcα, ns(ϕ), (94)
whereφϕr(zϕ)is the nondegenerate matrix, whose elements of each row depe nd on single
coordinate and contain unity, and hα
ϕ(zϕ)is a set of arbitrary nonzero functions depending
on single coordinates.
Proof.Parameterise matrix ( bϕr) as
bϕr(zϕ,c) :=φϕr(zϕ,c)
hϕ(xϕ,c), ns(ϕ),
wherehϕare some nonzero functions, and
(φϕr) :=
1φn+1n+2φn+1n+3···φn+1n

φn+3n+1φn+3n+21···φn+3n
...............
φnn+1φnn+2φnn+3···1
. (95)
This matrix has unities on the diagonal, and each row of matrix ( bϕr) is the quotient of
the row ( φϕr) byhϕ.
Multiply Eq. (87) by matrix bϕrand sum over ϕ:
gαϕcαbϕr=n/summationdisplay
ϕ=n+1gαϕcαφϕr
hϕ=δr
n.
This equality must be fulﬁlled for all coordinates and parameters. Th erefore
φϕr(zϕ,c) =φϕr(zϕ), h ϕ(xϕ,c) =hα
ϕ(zϕ)cα,
wherehα
ϕ(zϕ) are some functions on single coordinate. It means that matrix (95 ) must
not depend on c, and functions hϕbe linear in c.
29It implies that matrix ( bϕr) and consequently canonical separable metric is parame-
terized by 2 n2−narbitrary functions, and
2gαϕ=bnαϕ=φnϕhα
ϕ, ns(ϕ), (96)
where (φrϕ) is the matrix inverse to ( φϕr). Thus we have found canonical separable metric
in the case of only Killing vector ﬁelds and coisotropic coordinates.
Theorem 5.3. If separable metric admitexactly nand not more commuting Killing vector
ﬁelds, and all other coordinates are coisotropic, then ther e exists such set of parameters
(79) and separating functions (84), that the Hamilton–Jaco bi equation admit complete
separation of variables if and only if the dimension of the ma nifold is even, n= 2n,
and canonical separable metric has block form (93). The oﬀ di agonal blocks are given by
Eqs. (96), where (φnϕ)is the last row of the matrix inverse to arbitrary nondegener ate
matrix (95), whose rows depend on single coordinates, and th e diagonal consists of unities.
All conservation laws are linear:
pα=cα,/summationdisplay
ϕφrϕhα
ϕcαpϕ=ar.(97)
The second conservation law (97) is linear in momenta only after sepa ration of cyclic
coordinates. If this is not done, then it is quadratic
/summationdisplay
ϕφrϕhα
ϕpαpϕ=ar.
The respective Killing tensor is indecomposable in general.
The Hamilton–Jacobi equation for canonical separable metric (93) is

ϕ= 2E, (98)
and variables are completely separated
W′

The unusual feature of this separation is that parameters cappear in the denominator.
Finally, using canonical transformations we simplify the form of the c anonical separa-
ble metric by setting one of the nonzero elements in each row of matr ixhα
ϕto unity.
5.4 General separation of variables
If separable metric admits simultaneously commuting Killing vector ﬁeld s, indecompos-
ablequadraticconservationlaws, andcoisotropiccoordinates, th encoordinatesaredivided
into three groups ( x,y,z)∈Mdescribed in section 5. There are two possibilities for full
sets of independent parameters: (42) and (43), and separable m etric must have block
form (47). Separable functions are given by Eqs. (44) and (45).
30First, we consider case 2, when energy enters parameters for qu adratic conservation
laws,dn+mn+m:= 2E. Without loss of generality, we set
bµνij/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
i/negationslash=j≡0, b µνij/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
µ/negationslash=ν≡0, b µνr/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
µ/negationslash=ν≡0, k µν/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
µ/negationslash=ν≡0,
because metric gµνand matrix of parameters dijare diagonal. The respective Hamilton–
Jacobi equation is

Consider ( n−n)×(n−n) matrix

bϕii(zϕ,c)bϕr(zϕ,c)/parenrightbigg

whose elements of each row depend on single coordinate and, possib ly, the ﬁrst group of
parameters c. It must be nondegenerate, as we shall see. The inverse metric is

Note that elements of the inverse matrix depend in general on all co ordinates y,z, and
parameters c. Matrix Bmust be nondegenerate in order for Eq. (99) to have unique
solution, and
gµµ=bn+mn+mµµ(y,z),2gαφcα=bn+mn+mφ(y,z,c), (102)
31because constant Eenters the left hand side of Eq. (99) only through parameter dn+mn+m.
This implies that elements bn+mn+mµµdo not depend on c, andbn+mn+mφare linear in c:
bn+mn+mφ=bn+mn+mαφcα.
Substitution of obtained expressions gµνandgαφcαinto the Hamilton–Jacobi equation
(99) yields
gαβcαcβ+bn+mn+mµνkµν+bn+mn+mαφcαlφ= 0, (103)
which must be fulﬁlled for all c. Therefore functions kµµandlφmust be quadratic and
linear in c, respectively. It is suﬃcient to choose them homogeneous
kµµ=kαβ
µνcαcβ, l ϕ=lα
ϕcα, (104)
where functions kαβ

can diﬀer from zero for α/ne}ationslash=β. Indices of kandlare written one over the other because
they will never be raised or lowers.
To simplify separable metric, we perform canonical transformation (xα,zϕ,pα,pϕ)/ma√sto→
(Xα,Zϕ,Pα,Pϕ) with generating function
S2:=xαPα+zϕPϕ+/integraldisplay
dzϕlα
ϕPα,ns(ϕ). (105)
Then

ϕPα,
Xα=∂S2
∂pα=xα+/integraldisplay
dzϕlα
ϕ, Zϕ=∂S2
∂pϕ=zϕ,ns(ϕ).(106)
Afterwards relation (45) in the Hamiltonian formulation becomes
Pϕ=bϕijdij+bϕrar,
where equalities pα=Pα=cαare used. Therefore we can set lα
ϕ≡0 without loss of
generality. Now nontrivial blocks of inverse metric (102) take the f orm
gαβ=−bn+mn+mµνkαβ
µν,
gµµ=bn+mn+mµµ,
2gαφ=bn+mn+mαϕ,(107)
where functions kαβ

bymatrix(101). Notethatblock gαβmaybedegenerateduetothepresence ofrectangular
blockgαϕ. In section 5.2 this is not allowed because metric (74) becomes degen erate.
Moreover, using the canonical transformation of type (66), one of nonzero elements in
each row of matrix bµµiican be set to unity.
Thus we have solved the functional Hamilton–Jacobi equation.
Theorem 5.4. Let separable metric be of type [n,m,n−n−m]2. Then there is such set
of parameters (43) and separating functions (44), (45), tha t canonical separable metric
has block form (47) with blocks (107), where functions kαβ
µν(yµ) =kβα
µν(yµ)are arbitrary,
and functions bn+mn+mµµandbn+mn+mαϕare elements of the (n+m)-th row of the matrix
32inverse to matrix B(101). Matrix Bmust be nondegenerate with arbitrary elements, such
that elements of each row depend on single coordinates and pa rameters (cα)in such a way
that all elements of the (n+m)-th row of matrix B−1are nonzero, elements bn+mn+mµµ
do not depend on (cα), and elements bn+mn+mφare linear in parameters (cα). Arbitrary
functions must also produce nondegenerate separable metri c and provide real solutions of
Eqs. (44) for W′
µandW′
ϕ. In addition, conservation laws in the Hamiltonian formula tion
have the form
pα=cα,
biiµν/parenleftbig

+biiϕpϕ=dii,

+brϕpϕ=ar.(108)
In general, there are nlinear and n−nquadratic conservation laws for separable
metrics of type [ n,m,n−n−m]2form≥1.
Let us consider separable metrics of type [ n,m,n−n−m]1, i.g. energy Eenters the
group of parameters for coisotropic coordinates (42). Then solu tion of the Hamilton–
Jacobi equation repeats all previous steps. The only diﬀerence is t he change of relations
(102). Blocks of separable metric after the canonical transform ation (105) become
gµµ=bnµµ(y,z),2gαφ=bnαφ(y,z). (109)
Therefore we only formulate the result.
Theorem 5.5. Let separable metric be of type [n,m,n−n−m]1. Then there is such set
of parameters (42) and separating functions (44), (45), tha t canonical separable metric
has block form (47) with blocks
gαβ=−bnµνkαβ
µν,
gµµ=bnµµ,
2gαϕ=bnαϕ,(110)
where functions kαβ
µν(yµ) =kβα
µν(yµ)are arbitrary, and functions bnnµµandbnnαϕare el-
ements of the n-th row of the matrix inverse to matrix B(101). Matrix Bmust be
nondegenerate with arbitrary elements such that elements o f each row depend on single
coordinates and parameters (cα)in such a way that all elements of the last row of matrix
B−1are nonzero, elements bnnµµdo not depend on (cα), andbnnφare linear in param-
eters(cα). Arbitrary functions must also produce nondegenerate sepa rable metric and
provide real solutions of Eqs. (44) for W′
µandW′
ϕ. In addition, conservation laws in the
Hamiltonian formulation have form (108).
Thus we looked over all possible classes of separable metrics, introd uced sets of inde-
pendent parameters and separating functions and explicitly separ ated all variables. The
used method is constructive and allows to write down all nconservation laws (108) for
geodesics. We showed that there exists such choice of independen t parameters and sep-
arating functions in complete integrals that conservation laws are a t most quadratic in
momenta: (i), there are linear conservation laws corresponding to commuting Killing
vector ﬁelds; (ii), there are indecomposable quadratic conservat ion laws; (iii), there may
exist linear conservation laws for coisotropic coordinates which are not related to Killing
33vectors. The last possibility arises only for indeﬁnite metrics which ma y have zeroes on
the diagonal.
We see that constructed conservation laws are at most quadratic .
Theorem 5.6. Let the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for geodesics (2) admit co mplete separa-
tion of variables. Then there exists such choice of independ ent parameters and separating
functions in complete integrals that corresponding conser vation laws are at most quadratic
in momenta.
This statement is important because for another choice of parame ters and separating
functions we cannot guarantee the absence of higher order cons ervation laws.
At the end we prove that any additional conservation law is a functio n of conservation
laws described in theorems (5.4) and (5.5). To this end we square equ alitypα=cα.
Then all conservation laws become quadratic (remember that func tionsbiiϕandbrϕare
linear in cαand, consequently, in momenta pα). Part of these conservation laws may be
decomposable but this is not essential. We simplify notation:
(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(qα),
(pα,pµ,pϕ)/ma√sto→(pα),
(c2
α,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(ca),
where indices in the right hand sides take all values from 1 to n:α= 1,...,nand
a= 1,...,n. The conservation laws take the form
ca=Fa(q,p) =1
2fαβ
apαpβ,
wherefαβ
a(q) are some functions only on coordinates q. They contain the Hamiltonian
among themselves: for separable metrics of type 1 and 2, it is FnandFn+m, respectively.
Perform the canonical transformation( qα,pα)/ma√sto→(Qa,Pa) with generating functions S2:=
W(q,P) to action-angle variables. Then
Fa=Pa,∀a= 1,...n,
in new variables. Assume that there is additional involutive conserva tion law
G:=n/summationdisplay
a=1Ga(Q)Pm
a=const, m∈R,
with some diﬀerentiable functions Gaonly from new coordinates, and where mis some
real number. In particular, Gmay be homogeneous polynomial of any order mon new
momenta. Involutivity means that
[G,Fa] = [G,Pa] =n/summationdisplay
b=1∂Gb
∂QaPm
b= 0.
This equality must hold for all momenta and values of index a. Therefore functions Ga
do not depend on coordinates and, consequently, there is functio nal dependence between
integrals( Fa,G)because thenumber offunctions Fainmaximal andequalstothenumber
ofmomenta, i.e. anyadditional conservation lawissome functiononin tegrals(Fa) atleast
locally,G=G(F). Thus we proved
34Theorem 5.7. Let variables in the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for geodesic s be completely
separable, and all conservation laws Faare found according to theorems (5.4) and (5.5).
Then any additional involutive conservation law Gfor geodesics is some function G=
G(F)at least locally.
This solves completely the St¨ ackel problem for metrics of arbitrar y signature on mani-
folds of any dimension. All separable metrics are divided into equivalen ce classes. Metrics
in each class are related by canonical transformations and nondeg enerate transformations
of parameters which do not involve coordinates. There is the canon ical (the simplest)
separable metric in each equivalence class. Its form is given by theor ems 5.4 and 5.5.
Corresponding conservation laws are at most quadratic in momenta . For other choices of
parameters conservation laws may have higher order but they are functionally dependent
on conservation laws listed in theorems 5.4 and 5.5 due to theorem 5.7. MatrixBin
general theorems is constructed as matrix (94). The proved the orems are constructive. In
next sections we list all separable metrics in two, three, and four dim ensions as examples.
6 Separation of variables in two dimensions
Two dimensional manifolds provide the simplest examples of separable metrics for the
Hamilton– Jacobi equation for geodesics which have important feat ures present in higher
dimensions. Separation of variables in two dimensions is considered in e xample 5.1 in
detail. Therefore we only formulate results.
There are only three classes of diﬀerent separable metrics.
1)Class[2,0,0].Two commuting Killing vectors. Coordinates and parameters:
(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(x1,x2),(cα,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(c1,c2).
This case is described by theorem 4.2. In canonical form, the invers e separable metric is
(pseudo)Euclidean:
gαβ=ηαβ, (111)
whereηαβis either Euclidean or Lorentzian metric. The Hamilton–Jacobi equat ion has
the form
ηαβW′
αW′
β=ηαβcαcβ.
Variables are separated as
W′
α=cα.
The system has two linear conservation laws:
pα=cα, (112)
and respective coordinates x1,x2are cyclic. Separable metric (111) has two independent
commuting Killing vector ﬁelds ∂1and∂2.
2)Class[1,1,0]2.One Killing vector and one indecomposable quadratic conservation
law. Coordinates and parameters:
(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(x1:=x,y2:=y),(cα,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(c1:=c,d22:= 2E).
35This case in more generality is considered in example 5.2. Canonical sep arable (pseudo)-
Riemannian metric has form (77)
g∗∗=/parenleftbigg
−k(y) 0
0 1/parenrightbigg
, (113)
wherek(y)/ne}ationslash= 0 is an arbitrary function. For k <0 andk >0, we have Riemannian and
Lorentzian metrics, respectively. The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is
−kW′2
1+W′2
2= 2E.
Variables are separated in the following way
W1=c, W′2
2= 2E+kc2>0.
In the Hamiltonian formulation, we have one linear and one quadratic c onservation laws:
p1=c, p2
2−k(y)c2= 2E.
Canonical separable metric (113) is parameterized by one arbitrar y function k(y)/ne}ationslash= 0,
satisfying inequality 2 E+kc2>0 for ﬁxed Eandc.
3)Class[0,2,0]2.Tow quadratic conservation laws. Coordinates and parameters:
(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(y1,y2),(cα,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(d11:=d,d22:= 2E).
This case is described by theorem 5.1. In canonical form, the separ able metric is given by
Eq. (59). Variables are completely separated (50), where matrix bis given by Eq. (57).
Conservation laws are quadratic (56). The canonical separable me tric is parameterized
by four arbitrary functions φ11(y1),φ12(y1),φ21(y2), andφ22(y2), whose restrictions are
described inexample5.1indetail. Thisclassofmetrics containstwo dime nsional Liouville
systems (8).
4)Class[1,0,1]1.One Killing vector and one coisotropic coordinate. Coordinates
and parameters:
(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(x1:=x,z2:=z),(cα,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(c1:=c,a2:= 2E).
Appearance of zeroes onthe diagonal is possible only for Lorentzia n signature metrics and
one Killing vector. This case is described by theorem 5.3. Canonical se parable metric has
form (93) where oﬀ diagonal block bnαφis reduced to one nonzero function b(z), which
can be transformed to unity by the canonical transformation, i.e.
g∗∗=/parenleftbigg0 1
1 0/parenrightbigg
. (114)
This metric produces two linear conservation laws
p1=c, cp 2=E (115)
We see that separation of variables in two dimensions corresponds t o two commuting
Killing vectors ∂xand∂z, i.e. coordinates x,zare null. Therefore separable metric (168)
is equivalent to the Lorentz metric, and respective classes are also equivalent [1 ,0,1]1∼
[2,0,0].
All three classes of separable metrics were known already to St¨ ac kel [1]. However the
case 4) with coisotropic coordinate was not described. Moreover, we proved that there no
other separable metrics.
367 Separation of variables in three dimensions
There are six diﬀerent classes of separable metrics.
1)Class[3,0,0].Three commuting Killing vectirs. Coordinates and parameters:
(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(x1,x2,x3),(cα,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(c1,c2,c3).
In canonical form, the separable metric is (pseudo)Euclidean. Sep aration of variables
and conservation laws have the same form as in two dimensions in case [2,0,0], but now
indicesα= 1,2,3 take three values, and all Cartesian coordinates xαare cyclic.
2)Class[2,1,0]2.Two commuting Killing vectors and one quadratic conservation
law. Coordinates and parameters:
(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(x1,x2,y3:=y),(cα,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(c1,c2,d33:= 2E).
Canonical separable metric has the form (77):
g∗∗=/parenleftbigggαβ(y) 0
0 1/parenrightbigg
, α,β = 1,2, (116)
wheregαβis an arbitrary symmetric nondegenerate matrix. The Hamilton–Jac obi equa-
tion and separation of variables are as follows
gαβW′
αW′
β+W′2
3= 2E,
W′
α=cα, W′2
3= 2E−gαβcαcβ.
Conservation laws are
pα=cα, gαβ(y)pαpβ+p2
3= 2E. (117)
Inthiscase, thecanonicalseparablemetricisparameterizedbyth reearbitraryfunctionsof
single argument in matrix gαβwith restriction det gαβ/ne}ationslash= 0. Moreover, condition W′2
3≥0
also restricts arbitrary functions for ﬁxed Eandc. Depending on matrix gαβseparable
metric (116) may have arbitrary signature. In particular, when ma trixgαβis constant,
we return to class [3 ,0,0].
3)Class[1,2,0]2. One Killing vector and two quadratic conservation laws. Coordi-
nates and parameters:
(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(x1,y2,y3),(cα,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(c1:=c,d22:=d,d33:= 2E).
This case is described by theorem 5.2. It is new, and we consider it in mo re detail. First,
we deﬁne matrix b:
bµµii=/parenleftbigg
φ22(y2)φ23(y2)
φ32(y3)φ33(y3)/parenrightbigg
, b iiµµ=1
detb/parenleftbigg
φ33−φ23
−φ32φ22/parenrightbigg
,
where det b=φ22φ33−φ23φ32/ne}ationslash= 0. After canonical transformation of type (66), One
element in each row of matrix bcan be transformed to ±1. Let
φ22= 1, φ 32=−1.
Then
bµµii=/parenleftbigg
1φ23
−1φ33/parenrightbigg
, b iiµµ=1
detb/parenleftbigg
φ33−φ23
1 1/parenrightbigg
, (118)
37wheredet b=φ23+φ33. Diagonalmetricelements correspondingtoquadraticconservat ion
laws are
g22=b3322=1
φ23+φ33, g33=b3333=1
φ23+φ33. (119)
Element g11of inverse metric has form (74)
g11=−bµν
33k11
µν=−1
φ23+φ33(k11
22+k11
33).
Simplify notation
φ23(y2) :=φ2(y2), φ33(y3) :=φ3(y3), k11
22(y2) :=−k2(y2)k11
33:=−k3(y3).
Now the canonical separable metric takes the form
g∗∗=1
φ2+φ3
k2+k30 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
. (120)
Variables in the Hamilton–Jacobi equation

are completely separated:
W′
1=c,
W′2
2=d+2φ2E−k2c2,
W′2
3=−d+2φ3E−k3c2.(121)
These relations yield conservation laws

p2

k2+k3/parenrightbig

Thus canonical separable metric (120) is parameterized by four fu nctions of single ar-
gumentφ2,3andk2,3. They have to produce nondegenerate metric, and Eq. (121) mus t
admitrealsolutionsforseparatingfunctions W′

4)Class[1,1,1]2.One Killing vector, one indecomposable quadratic conservation
law, and one coisotropic coordinate. Coordinates and parameters :
(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(x1:=x,y2:=y,z3:=z),(cα,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(c1:=c,d22:= 2E,a3:=a).
This case is described by theorem 5.4. As always, we start with arbitr ary (2×2) matrix
(101). To simplify notation, let
b2222≡1, b 223≡φ2(y), b 322≡φ3/c, b 33≡1/c.

The dependence on cfollows from the independence of metric components on parameter s.

Canonical separable metric (124) is parameterized by three arbitr ary functions φ2(y),
φ3(z), andk2(y). Determinant of the inverse metric (124) is

4(1−φ2φ3)3/ne}ationslash= 0,∞.
Arbitrary functions must be restricted φ2/ne}ationslash= 0 and φ2φ3/ne}ationslash= 1, because otherwise the
determinant is degenerate. Moreover functions φ2andk2are to be chosen in such a way
as to provide real solution for the ﬁrst equation (125) with respec t toW′

arbitrary functions the separable metric may any signature.
5)Class[1,1,1]1.One Killing vector, one indecomposable quadratic conservation
law, and one coisotropic coordinate. Coordinates and parameters :
(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(x1:=x,y2:=y,z3:=z),(cα,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(c1:=c,d22:=d,a3:= 2E).
This case is given by theorem 5.5. Matrix Bhas the same form as in case [1 ,1,1]2(123),
however the canonical separable metric is deﬁned by the last row of matrixB−1:
g∗∗=1
1−φ2φ3
φ3k20 1/2

39After substitution W′

φ3k2c2−φ3W′2

Variables are separated as

So, canonical separable metric (127) is parameterized by three ar bitrary functions
φ2(y),φ3(z), andk2(y). They are restricted by nondegeneracy of the determinant
detg∗∗=φ3
4(1−φ2φ3)3/ne}ationslash= 0,∞
whichimply φ3/ne}ationslash= 0andφ2φ3/ne}ationslash= 1. Moreover, functions φ2andk2havetoprovideexistence

separable metric may have any signature.
6)Class[0,3,0]2.Absence ofKilling vectors andcoisotropiccoordinates. Coordinate s

(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(y1,y2,y3),(cα,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(d11:=d1,d22:=d2,d33:= 2E).
This case is described by theorem 5.1. After the canonical transfo rmation with generating

Five of six separable metrics in three dimensions were listed in [29], wher e diﬀerent
technique is used. Types of metrics coincide with respect to the num ber of Killing vectors,
quadratic conservation laws and coisotropic coordinates. Howeve r computations of the
present section allowed us to ﬁnd explicitly separable functions W′
α,α= 1,...,3. In
addition, we give more detailed classiﬁcation indicated by indices 1 ,2, and separable
metric of class [1 ,1,1]1is not mentioned in paper [29].
8 Separation of variables in four dimensions
Separable metrics in four dimensions are of great importance in grav ity models, in par-
ticular, in general relativity. These metrics has Lorentzian signatu re, and coisotropic
coordinates may appear. There are ten classes of diﬀerent separ able metrics in four di-
mensions.
1)Class[4,0,0].Four Killing vectors. Variables are separated in the same way as in
lower dimensions. Canonical separable metric and conservation laws have form (111) and
(112), respectively, but now indices run over all four values, α,β= 1,2,3,4.
2)Class[3,1,0]2.ThreecommutingKillingvectorsandoneindecomposablequadratic
conservation law. Asinthree dimensions, thecanonical separable m etric andconservation
41laws have form (116) and (117), but indices α,β= 1,2,3 take more values. The canonical
separable metric is parameterized by six arbitrary functions.
The Kasner solution [30] lies in this class.
3)Class[2,2,0]2.Two commuting Killing vector ﬁelds and two indecomposable
quadraticconservationlawswithoutcoisotropiccoordinates. Coo rdinatesandparameters:
(xα,yµ,zϕ)/ma√sto→(x1,x2,y3,y4),(cα,dij,ar)/ma√sto→(c1,c2,d33:=d,d44:= 2E).
This case is described by theorem 5.2. Matrix band diagonal metric elements g33andg44
have form (118) and (119) with replacement (2 ,3)/ma√sto→(3,4). The block of inverse metric
gαβ,α,β= 1,2, is

whereφ3(y3),φ4(y4), andkαβ

Thus canonical separable metric has the form

must be chosen in such a way that equations for W′(138) have real solutions.
This class of separable metrics includes the Schwarzschild, Reissner –Nordstr¨ om, Kerr,

separable metric of type [2 ,0,2]1can be only (++ −−).

For example, the Friedmann metric [31] belongs to this class.

This case is described by theorem 5.4. We parameterize matrix Bin the following way

△23=φ34φ42−φ32,△33=1−φ24φ42, △43=(φ32φ24−φ34)hc,
△24=φ43φ32−φ42,△34=φ42φ23−φ43,△44=(1−φ23φ32)hc.
Equations (107) imply components of separable metric

9)Class[1,2,1]1.One Killing vector, two indecomposable quadratic conservation

Now the separable metric is deﬁned by the last row of inverse matrix B−1. Equations

Note that metric components, as in the previous case, do not depe nd on parameters c.

Thus canonical separable metric (166) of class [0 ,4,0]2is parameterized by twelve arbi-
trary functions of single coordinates entering matrix b(165) with condition △/ne}ationslash= 0. More-
over, arbitrary functions must provide real solution W′
µof Eqs. (167) for ﬁxed values of
parameters d1,2,3, andE. In addition, every row of matrix bµµiimust have at least one
nonconstant function, because otherwise a Killing vector ﬁeld appe ars.
The list of all separable metrics in four dimensions appeared in [32]. Se ven of ten
separable metrics were found in [21].
9 Conclusion
So the St¨ ackel problem is completely solved for metrics of arbitrar y signature in arbitrary
dimensions n. Allseparablemetrics aredivided into equivalence classes [ n,m,n−n−m]1,2,
49characterized by the number nof commuting Killing vector ﬁelds, number mof indecom-
posable quadratic conservation laws, and the number n−n−mof coisotropic coordinates,
indices 1 and 2 denoting the group of parameters (coisotropic or qu adratic, respectively)
to which energy Ebelongs. Within each equivalence class separable metrics are related
by canonical transformations and by nondegenerate transform ations of parameters which
do not involve coordinates. There is canonical (the most simple) sep arable metric in each
class. In general, its form is deﬁned by theorems 5.4 and 5.5. These t heorems are con-
structive. As examples, we list all canonical separable metrics in two (3 classes), three
(6 classes), and four (10 classes) dimensions. These classes includ e all separable metrics
known up to now and contain several new classes with coisotropic co ordinates.
Diﬀerent technique of ﬁnding separable metrics was used in [16, 17]. W e obtained the
same block form of canonical separable metrics, and types of metr ics coincide. Moreover
we gave more detailed classiﬁcation indicated by indices 1 ,2 and succeeded in ﬁnding
explicitly all separating functions W′
α,α= 1,...,n, and all conservation laws.
Separable metrics of indeﬁnite signature open new perspectives in g ravity models. In
general, equations for metric are very complicated, and contain ma ny unknown metric
components. To simplify the problem, one usually supposes that spa ce-time has some
symmetry, and this reduces the number of unknown variables and e quations. Almost
all known exact solutions were obtained in this way, and, as a rule, th ey yield separable
Hamilton–Jacobi equations for geodesics. The problem can be inver ted. We may postu-
late the separability of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation and substitut e a separable metric
in, for example, Einstein equations. This also signiﬁcantly reduces th e number of inde-
pendent metric components and gives a hope to ﬁnd new exact solut ions. The important
feature of this approach is that vacuum Einstein equations reduce to the system of non-
linear ordinary diﬀerential equations because separable metrics co ntain only functions of
single coordinates. This approach seems very attractive because the class of separable
metrics is much wider then the class of symmetric metrics admitting co mplete separation
of variables.
Most of known exact solutions in general relativity admit complete se paration of
variables in the Hamilton–Jacobi equation. B. Carter analyzed Einst ein–Maxwell equa-
tions with cosmological constant for separable metrics of class [2 ,2,0]2and showed that
Schwarzschild, Reissner–Nordstr¨ om, Kerr and many more solutio ns belong to this class
[24]. It is easily checked that Kasner solution is of type [3 ,1,0]2and the Friedmann
solution is of class [1 ,3,0]2. So there is an interesting problem to check to which class
belongs a known exact solution. It is nontrivial because solutions ar e often written in
a nonseparable coordinate systems. The opposite way of thought is to analyze Einstein
equations for all other separable metrics like it was done by B. Carte r for metrics of type
[2,2,0]2. The advantage of this approach is that metric depends on relative ly small num-
ber of unknown functions of single variables, and this gives a hope to ﬁnd exact solutions
of Einstein equations even without any symmetry. Moreover, geod esic equations in such
cases are Liouville integrable, and the global structure of respect ive space-times can be,
probably, analyzed analytically.
