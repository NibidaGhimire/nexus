The thermodynamics of rigidly rotating systems experience divergences when the system dimen-
sions transverse to the rotation axis exceed the critical size imposed by the causality constraint.
The rotation with imaginary angular frequency, suitable for numerical lattice simulations in Eu-
clidean imaginary-time formalism, experiences fractalization of thermodynamics in the thermody-
namic limit, when the system’s pressure becomes a fractal function of the rotation frequency. Our
work connects these two phenomena by studying how thermodynamics fractalizes as the system
size grows. We examine an analytically-accessible system of rotating massless scalar matter on a
one-dimensional ring and the numerically-treatable case of rotation in the cylindrical geometry and
show how the ninionic deformation of statistics emerges in these systems. We discuss a no-go theo-
rem on analytical continuation between real- and imaginary-rotating theories. Finally, we compute
the moment of inertia and shape deformation coefficients caused by the rotation of the relativistic
bosonic gas. In all cases, we show that finite-mass effects are quantitative, leaving our conclusions
qualitatively unchanged.
I. INTRODUCTION
Effects of rotation on the state of physical bodies have
been a subject of passionate interest throughout the
decades. In metals, the uniform rotation acts on electrons
via a centrifugal force that produces a slight but exper-
imentally perceptible gradient of electric potential mea-
sured at ∼102−3Hz [1]. At the level of electronic spins,
one of the numerous examples of rotation-generated phe-
nomena is the Barnett effect [2] which – with its celebrity
reciprocal, the Einstein–de Haas effect [3] – relates the
mechanical torque and magnetization in ferromagnets.
The nuclear analog of the Barnett effect substantially af-
fects the polarization of the protons (ions of hydrogen)
in the water rotating with the frequency ∼104Hz [4].
However, the fastest rotation of matter has been pro-
duced in noncentral collisions of relativistic heavy ions
that create quark-gluon plasma in which the vorticity
reaches the values ∼1022Hz [5–7]. The fast rotation
affects the local properties of quark-gluon plasma, lead-
ing to various spin polarization phenomena, allowing us
to probe experimentally the interior of rapidly rotating
plasma in terms of its local vortical structure [8, 9].
There are various theoretical shreds of evidence
that fast rotation also affects the chiral [10–16] and
(de)confining transitions [17–27] of the quark-gluon
plasma. Theoretical methods, however, prevailingly as-
sume a rigid rotation that makes every physical point
rotate about a fixed axis with the same angular velocity.
While the rigid character of rotation substantially sim-
plifies the analytical treatment of the problem [28, 29],
the consensus on the thermodynamic properties of quark-
gluon plasma, even in this simplest case, is still absent,

alytical calculations. Moreover, the latest first-principle
simulation reveals the instability of the rigidly rotating
gluon plasma below the “supervortical” critical tempera-
ture [27], indicating the complexity of rotation in strongly
interacting systems.
First-principle information about the quark-gluon
plasma comes from lattice simulation in the Euclidean
imaginary time formalism where the real angular momen-
tum Ω brings the sign problem [30] which makes the nu-
merical simulations impossible. This inconvenience can
traditionally be overcome by turning the angular momen-
tum into the complex plane and considering the purely
imaginary rotation Ω I=−iΩ in full analogy with the
baryon chemical potential [17, 19, 21, 23, 30, 31].
The imaginary rotation differs, however, from the
imaginary baryonic chemical potential: the analytical
continuation to real rotation used in numerical lattice
simulations has some unusual features including the
emergence of (stable) ghost-like excitations [19] charac-
terized by “ninionic” deformation of statistics and the ap-
pearance of the fractal features of thermodynamics under
imaginary rotation. The fractalization imposes a no-go
theorem on an analytical continuation for rotating sys-
tems in the thermodynamic limit [32].
In our work, we discuss the effect of rotation on the
thermodynamics of the simplest possible system repre-
sented by the massless scalar fields. This limit is con-
venient as it allows many of the calculations to be per-
formed analytically. We explore the effect of finite mass
in all considered setups and confirm that all features re-
main qualitatively identical to those in the massless case.
First, we briefly introduce the real and imaginary rota-
tion in Sec. II. Then, in Sec. III, we analyze the interrela-
tion between the fractal features, analytical continuation,
and the causality constraint for the model formulated on
a one-dimensional ring which can be treated analytically.
Section IV approaches real and imaginary rotationarXiv:2304.05998v2  [hep-th]  8 Oct 20232
within the scope of the relativistic kinetic theory applied
to the three-dimensional rotating gas. It also addresses
the mechanical features of the rotating gas, including
its moment of inertia and shape-deformation coefficients.
This analysis is followed by Sec. V, where we pursue,
for simplicity, a “hybrid” quantization approach based
on the cylindrical waves with continuous momentum in
a spatially unbounded region.
We show the advantages of both discussed approaches
in Sec. VI, where the rotating gas in the cylindrically-
bounded region and the discrete quantization of the
transverse modes is treated numerically in great de-
tail. Furthermore, we reveal the analytical fractaliza-
tion of the thermodynamics numerically in the three-
dimensional rotating gas and explicitly show strong par-
allels with the fractalization of thermodynamics in the
analytically-accessible one-dimensional ring. For simplic-
ity, we implement the boundary using Dirichlet boundary
conditions [33], however it is reasonable to expect that
similar results regarding fractalization can be expected
when von Neumann or, more generally, Robin boundary
conditions are considered [34–36].
Our last section is devoted to conclusions and a sum-
mary of our results. Throughout the article, we work
with the conventions ℏ=c=kB= 1.
II. IMAGINARY ROTATION AND STATISTICS
A. Real rotation and imaginary rotation
Let us consider a quantum-mechanical system of
bosonic particles rotating uniformly (rigidly, as a solid
body) with the constant angular frequency Ω about the
zaxis. For simplicity, we can assume that the system of
particles is rotating inside a cylinder possessing reflective
boundary conditions, such as Dirichlet boundary condi-
tions [33]. In the co-rotating frame, the free energy of
the system takes the following form:
F=V
βXZ
α,mln
1−e−β(ωα,m+mΩ)
, (1)
where β= 1/Tis the inverse temperature, Vis the vol-
ume of the system, ωα,mis the energy spectrum of the
particles in the laboratory reference frame, and αis a
collective notation of quantum numbers other than the
projection of angular momentum, m≡mz∈Z. We work
with zero-charge systems so that the chemical potential
does not enter the free energy of the system (1). We
also ignore the zero-point contribution associated with
the vacuum Casimir energy since it does not affect the
thermodynamics of the system.
In order to determine the thermodynamic characteris-
tics (for example, energy, pressure, entropy, angular mo-
mentum, moment of inertia, etc), it is sufficient to evalu-
ate the statistical integral (1). For bosonic particles, thecontribution of each quantum level to the thermodynamic
quantities is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution
n(bos)
ω=1
eβω−1, [bosonic statistics] , (2)
where ωis the energy of the quantum level. In a rigidly
rotating system, the statistical weight is determined by
the energy in the co-rotating reference frame:
ω= ˜ωα,m≡ωα,m−mΩ, (3)
thus demonstrating explicitly how rotation with Ω ̸= 0
affects the statistical particle distribution.
It is convenient to calculate the thermodynamic prop-
erties of rotating particles using the imaginary-time for-
malism in which the time coordinate is turned to a com-
plex variable via the Wick transformation, t→τ=it.
The imaginary time τis compactified to a circle of length
β= 1/Trelated to thermal equilibrium temperature T.
The compactification imposes the matching conditions on
the fields: all scalar fields ϕare periodic functions along
the thermal direction,
ϕ(x, τ) =ϕ(x, τ+β), (4)
while all fermionic fields (not considered in this arti-
cle) obey anti-periodic boundary conditions. The Bose-
Einstein statistical distribution (2) for bosonic fields can
be recovered automatically from the periodic boundary
conditions (4) [37].
The imaginary-time approach is intensively used in
numerical lattice simulations of quantum field theories
where the partition function is formulated in terms of
a statistical integral in Euclidean spacetime [38]. The
lattice simulations are especially useful for obtaining in-
formation about non-perturbative effects that cannot be
treated with standard perturbative methods [38].
However, the imaginary-time techniques cannot be di-
rectly applied to rotating systems because the action of
the Euclidean theory becomes a complex quantity at a
nonzero angular frequency, Ω ̸= 0, thus exhibiting the
so-called “sign problem” [30]. The latter property does
not allow us to treat the partition function of a rotating
system as a statistical integral, bringing us to an incon-
venient similarity with finite-density systems, where the
(baryonic) chemical potential also makes the Euclidean
action a complex quantity [38]. The only practical way
to avoid the sign problem for rotation is to consider the
angular frequency as a purely imaginary variable:
Ω =iΩI. (5)
The shift of the angular frequency to the complex
plane (5) restores the real-valuedness of the Euclidean
action [17, 30]. Having calculated the desired quantities
at a set of imaginary Ω I, one can then apply an analytical
continuation to map the results back to the realistic case
of real rotation [17, 21]. This prescription, applied to3
the angular frequency Ω, follows a standard set of prac-
tices invoked to avoid the sign problem in simulations of
finite-density systems [39].
In the context of the imaginary-time formalism, there
are two methods how one can implement the imaginary
rotation (5). The first approach, originally proposed in
Ref. [30] and adopted in various numerical Monte Carlo
simulations of (quark-) gluon plasmas [21, 26, 27, 30],
consists in (i) considering the system in a non-inertial
co-rotating reference frame in Minkowski spacetime; (ii)
turning the system, via a Wick transformation, to the
curved Euclidean spacetime with a complex metric ten-
sor; (iii) implementing the substitution (5) which makes
the metric tensor real-valued again; (iv) simulating the
thermodynamics at a set of non-zero Ω Iwith the stan-
dard periodic boundary conditions (4); (v) fitting the ob-
tained numerical results by a reasonable analytical func-
tion and, finally, (vi) making an analytical continuation
of the lattice results to the real-valued frequency by set-
ting
Ω2
I→ −Ω2. (6)
The second approach implements the imaginary rota-
tion in the imaginary-time formalism in a more straight-
forward way using the property that the imaginary fre-
quency Ω Icorresponds, after all, to a uniform rotation
of a subspace of a timeslice of the Euclidean spacetime
about a certain fixed axis [19, 23]. As the imaginary time
variable τadvances for a full period from τ= 0 to τ=β,
the system experiences a spatial rotation by the angle:
χ=βΩI≡2πν , ν =βΩI
2π. (7)
The turn of the space necessitates a modification of the
standard bosonic boundary conditions (4) which should
now incorporate a translation in imaginary time with the
uniform rotation of the Euclidean spacetime.
Under the imaginary rotation, the bosonic wavefunc-
tion appears to satisfy the rotwisted boundary condition:
ϕ(x, τ) =ϕ
ˆRχx, τ+β
, (8)
where the 3 ×3 matrix
ˆRχ=
cosχsinχ0
−sinχcosχ0
0 0 1
, (9)
written in Cartesian coordinates, corresponds to the
global rotation of the whole spatial Euclidean subspace,
x→x′=ˆRχx, by the angle (7) around the zaxis. In
the absence of rotation, the transformation (9) becomes
a unit matrix and the boundary condition (8) reduces
to the standard periodic condition for bosons (4). The
rotwisted boundary conditions, visualized in Fig. 1, have
already been discussed in the context of the Euclidean
lattice simulations of field theories [23, 26].

by the statistical angle (7) produced by the imaginary angular
velocity Ω I.
The boundary conditions (8) are obviously invariant
under 2 πshifts of χ, or equivalently, shifts by one unit
inν:
χ→χ+ 2π , ν →ν+ 1, (10)
and, in the parity-unbroken systems, under the reversal
of the rotation angle:
χ→ −χ , ν → −ν . (11)
The latter condition holds for a system of neutral par-
ticles that we consider. The symmetry under clockwise
and counterclockwise rotations (11) can be broken, for
example, for charged particles subjected to a background
magnetic field which leads, in particular, to a rotation
diode effect in semiconductors [40].
B. Imaginary rotation and ninionic statistics
The differences between the two implementations of
the imaginary rotation are two-fold: one can either con-
sider the curved Euclidean spacetime with corotating co-
ordinates and ordinary boundary conditions (4) imple-
mented along the compactified time (the first approach)
or use Cartesian coordinates with the rotwisted bound-
ary conditions (8) following the second approach. In our
article, we consider field theories subjected to imaginary
rotation introduced via the rotwisted boundary condi-
tion.
The boundary conditions imposed on the fields in the
imaginary time direction have one-to-one correspondence
with the statistical distribution of the particles. For ex-
ample, the equal-time commutation relations for bosonic
fields imply the periodic boundary conditions (4), which
lead to the Bose-Einstein distribution for bosons (2).
Analogously, anti-commuting fermionic variables possess
anti-periodic conditions in the compactified time direc-
tion which correspond to the Fermi-Dirac statistics [37].4
Therefore, it is appropriate to ask which statistical dis-
tribution corresponds to the rotwisted boundary condi-
tions (8)?
It turns out that the imaginary rotation deforms the
statistical distribution of fermions and bosons, leading
to a “ninionic” deformation which matches neither the
bosonic nor the fermionic statistical distributions [32].
For example, for bosons, the ninionic deformation takes
the following form:
n(nin)
ω(ξ) =eβωcosξ−1
1−2eβωcosξ+e2βω, (12)
where ω≡ωα,mis associated with the energy of the
quantum state in the laboratory reference frame and
ξ=mχ= 2πmν is the deformation parameter associ-
ated with the “statistical angle” χ, Eq. (7). The lat-
ter depends on the angular velocity Ω Iof the imagi-
nary rotation in Euclidean spacetime. Notice that at
the zero (modulo 2 π) statistical angle, the ninionic de-
formation (12) of the bosonic distribution (2) disappears:
n(nin)
ω(ξ= 2πk) =n(b)
ωwith an integer k∈Z.
The ninionic deformation (12) can be understood as
the real part of the bosonic occupation number (2),
n(nin)
ω(ξ) = Re n(bos)
ω+iξ/β, (13)
at an imaginary chemical potential µ=ξ/β.
Given the unusual form of the ninionic deformation of
the bosonic statistical distribution (12), it is appropri-
ate to ask how this deformation modifies the statistical
properties of the thermal state? What are the conse-
quences which are brought to the theory by the introduc-
tion of the new dimensionless parameter, the statistical
angle (7)? The answer to this question, which depends
on the volume of the rotating system, is one of the aims
of our article.
In respect of the causality, the rigid rotation with
real-valued angular velocity is a well-defined notion only
for transversely-bounded systems. On the contrary, the
imaginary rotation does not impose any bounds on the
size of the system due to the absence of the notion of the
light cone in the Euclidean space (in other words, there
is no causality constraint in the imaginary time formal-
ism because it has no notion of real time). Therefore,
the imaginary rotation does not lead to causality prob-
lems [30] and can be formulated in the thermodynamic
limit in the whole Euclidean space [23]. The relation
between imaginary and real rotation in terms of the an-
alytical continuation is another aim of our paper.
C. Ninionic statistics and fractal thermodynamics
Sticking to an infinite-volume system, one can show,
both in the scope of a classical interacting field the-
ory [31] as well as in a free bosonic quantum field the-
ory [32], that the imaginary rotation characterized bythe nonvanishing value of the statistical angle χmodi-
fies the relation between the physical temperature T→

direction β:1

is the Thomae function. In other words, function (15)
gives zero for all irrational numbers and equals to a
nonzero number 1 /qdetermined by the denominator q
of the rational argument x=p/q∈Qwith two natural
coprime numbers p, q∈N.
FIG. 2. Thomae function (15).
The Thomae function (15), shown in Fig. 2, is known
also under other names, such as the raindrop function,
the modified Dirichlet function, the popcorn function,
etc. This function has the amazing counter-intuitive
property stating that the function is discontinuous if its
argument xis rational, and it is continuous provided x
is irrational. The Thomae function emerges naturally
in various physical systems such as one-dimensional dis-
ordered crystals, Hubbard model of particles on a ring,
phyllotaxis problem, and fractional quantum Hall effect
(we refer to Ref. [41] for a comprehensive discussion).
The Thomae function (15) possesses a nontrivial frac-
tal structure [41–43] which equips the thermodynamics
of imaginary rotation with fractal properties. The frac-
talization (and “defractalization”) of thermodynamics of
imaginary rotating systems will also be addressed in this
paper.
1Throughout this paper, we shall use the subscript (or super-
script) Ito indicate when an observable is computed under imag-
inary rotation.5
Notice that the behavior of the physical tempera-
ture (14) as a function of the statistical angle (7) is deter-
mined solely by the denominator qof the rational number
χ/(2π) and not by its numerator. Irrational (in units of
2π/β) frequencies correspond to zero temperature (14).
In the absence of the imaginary rotation, χ= 0, one
gets the standard relation between temperature Tand
the length of the imaginary time direction β, as expected:
T(β,0) =1
β. (16)
The ninionic deformation of bosonic statistics can be
readily understood in the imaginary time formalism for
free massless bosons in the thermodynamic limit (on an
infinite spatial line) where the particles possess the linear
energy dispersion, ωk=|k|. In this conformal system,
the thermal pressure of bosons Pis equal to their energy
density, E≡P, taking a well-known expression in the
absence of imaginary rotation:
P0=Z∞

6β2, [ΩI= 0].(17)
The temperature of the system is given by the in-
verse length βof the compactified imaginary-time direc-
tion (16).
Looking ahead a little, one can also discuss the ther-
modynamics of the same system compactified into a ring
of an infinitely large radius Rwhich is subjected to the
imaginary rotation with the angular velocity Ω I. The
pressure can be derived via the ninionic statistics (13):

where the ninionic parameter ξm=χm≡βΩImis ex-
pressed via the angular momentum mand the statis-
tical angle (7). The energy spectrum in the statistical
sum (18),
ωm=1
R|m|, (19)
corresponds to the laboratory frame. In the thermody-
namic limit, R→ ∞ , the energy gaps of the discrete
spectrum (19) shrink, the variable m/R becomes the con-
tinuum momentum k, and the sum in Eq. (18) reduces to
an integral thus bridging the gap between the exotic (18)
and standard (17) statistical sums in the thermodynamic
limit.
However, the presence of the imaginary rotation Ω I
makes the system nontrivial even in the thermodynamic
limit. Indeed, the pressure of the imaginary rotating sys-
tem (18) has the same expression as the pressure of the
non-rotating one (17) with only one important difference
that the temperature of the former (14) becomes a fractal
function (15) of the imaginary angular frequency Ω I. Inthe next section, we discuss the particularities of fractal-
ization of thermodynamics by imaginary rotation work-
ing with an analytically-solvable example of a free mass-
less particle confined to a one-dimensional ring.
III. REAL AND IMAGINARY ROTATIONS
ON THE RING
A. Classical (non-quantum) system
Let us consider an ensemble of bosonic massless par-
ticles, constrained to move on a ring of fixed radius R
with angle coordinates φ. Imposing that the system ro-
tates with angular velocity Ω, its free energy at inverse
temperature βreads

where Jz=−kφrepresents the angular momentum of
a particle spinning with azimuthal momentum kφ=
−kφ/R2, satisfying the dispersion relation k0=|kφ/R|=
|Rkφ|>0. The above integral can be readily evaluated,
F=−π2R
3β2Γ2(R),Γ(R) = (1 −Ω2R2)−1/2.(21)
Other thermodynamic quantities such as total entropy
S, thermodynamic pressure P, and total angular mo-
mentum M, can be obtained starting from the relation
[44]
dF=β−2Sdβ− PdV− M dΩ, (22)
where V= 2πRis the “volume” of the ring. Denoting by
an overhead bar volume-averaged quantities, A ≡ A /V,
we have
S=β2∂F

while the average energy Ecan be found from the Euler

E=F+β−1S+ ΩM. (24)
Taking into account the thermodynamic relations in
Eq. (23), the above relation can be recast as

Considering now the free energy at small values of the
rotation parameter Ω, we expand the free energy density
in a power series in the velocity of a corotating particle
vR= ΩR , (28)

(29)
where K2nare Ω-independent dimensionless coefficients,
F(0) is the free energy density in the absence of rotation,
and we took into account that Fis an even function of Ω.
By construction, one gets K0= 1. Comparing Eqs. (29)
and (26), it can be seen that
F(0) =−π
6β2, K 2n= (2n)!, K 2n+1= 0.(30)Clearly, F(0) and the K2ncoefficients are independent
of the system size.
The results for the coefficients K2nare also valid in
a multicomponent non-interacting gas since they reflect
the rotational response normalized per degree of freedom.
The zero-rotation limit of the moment of inertia, I0of a
one-component bosonic gas evaluates to
I0≡lim
Ω→0I(Ω) = −lim

which follows from the definition M(Ω) = I(Ω)Ω of the
moment of inertia I(Ω) in terms of the average angular
momentum M, obtained via the thermodynamic rela-
tion (23).
It is interesting to notice that recent first-principle sim-
ulations [27] indicate that in the high-temperature limit,
the rotating gluon gas possesses the dimensionless mo-
ment of inertia K2= 2.23(39) consistent with our esti-
mation (30):
K2= 2, [per one bosonic d.o.f.] . (32)
This result is not unexpected since at sufficiently high
temperatures, the gluon plasma becomes a weakly-
interacting gas of gluons. It is worth mentioning that
the value of K2receives corrections only if the quanta
are massive or if interactions are taken into account.
The next non-zero coefficient in the series (30),
K4= 24 , [per one bosonic d.o.f.] . (33)
corresponds to the correction to the free energy caused
by the deformation of the rotating gas due to rota-
tion. This correction also affects the moment of iner-
tia,I(Ω) = I0+I2v2
R/2 +. . ., with the universal non-
interacting coefficient I2/I0= 4.
We now consider the effect of the particle mass on
theK2ncoefficients. To this end, we evaluate Ffrom
Eq. (20) for the case when k0=q
k2φ/R2+M2, with M
being the particle mass. Performing a Lorentz transfor-
mation to the local rest frame, we get
F=2Rγ

creases the average free energy F(0, M), while the shape
coefficients K2(M) and K4(M) increase with respect to
their massless limits.
B. Relativistic rotation, particle spectrum
In this section, we consider a free massless particle on
a ring of a fixed radius Rwith the angle coordinate φas
shown in Fig. 4. For a static ring, the particle wavefunc-
tion is described by the Klein-Gordon equation:

lated to the laboratory coordinates as follows:

The energy spectrum (40) is bounded from below pro-
vided the causality condition is satisfied:
R|Ω|<1. (42)
The thermodynamics of the system is determined in the
rotating reference frame where all statistical distributions
are set by the energy in the co-rotating frame ˜ ωmrather
than by its laboratory-frame counterpart (19).
C. Free energy of rotating scalar field
We consider statistical mechanics of scalar particles in
the rotating environment. The corresponding statistical
sum,
Z ≡e−βF=Y
m∈Z∞X
nm=0e−β(ωm−Ωm)nm

m∈Zh
1−e−β(ωm−Ωm)i−1
,(43)
is formulated via the sum over states labeled by the angu-
lar momentum mwith the occupation number nmof sys-
tem’s levels that possess the total energy ˜Em,nm= ˜ωmnm
in the rotating reference frame and the total angular mo-
mentum Ln,mn=mnm. In Eq. (43), Fstands for the
free energy in the co-rotating reference frame. In the
statistical sum, we do not take into account a m= 0
contribution which corresponds to the zero-energy mode
and contributes to the zero-point (Casimir) vacuum en-
ergy [45]. We concentrate on the thermal part of the free
energy which possesses interesting fractal properties in
the thermodynamic limit.

. (46)
Notice that the Dedekind function (46) is defined only
in the upper complex plane Im z >0, which implies that
the free energy (45) is well-defined if and only if the
causality condition (42) is satisfied. The causality condi-
tion is absent for the case of the imaginary rotation (5),
when the angular frequency Ω becomes a purely imagi-
nary quantity. Indeed, according to the analytical prop-
erties of the Dedekind function (46), the free energy (45)
is a well-defined analytical function for any real value
of the imaginary angular frequency Ω Iat any radius of
the ring R. Consequently, the rigid imaginary rotation,
contrary to rotation in Minkowski spacetime, can be for-
mulated in the thermodynamic limit.
For convenience of our subsequent analysis, we con-
sider all physical quantities in units of the inverse length
1/βof the imaginary time direction. We introduce the
dimensionless length of the ring (the one-dimensional vol-
ume) Land the frequency of rotation ν, respectively:
L=2πR

ized statistical angle (7).

After taking the thermodynamic limit R→ ∞ and in
the absence of rotation, FI→F0=−P0=−π/6β2, as
established by Eq. (17). Note that F0agrees with the
classical expression F(0) in Eq. (30).
The first term in Eq. (48) could be erroneously mis-
taken for the regularized zero-point (Casimir) energy con-
tribution to the free energy. To show that this identifica-
tion is not correct, let us consider the trivial case ν= 0
which corresponds to a vanishing statistical angle, χ= 0
(nontrivial angles will be considered shortly after). The
low-temperature limit, β→ ∞ , for a ring with a fixed
radius Rcorresponds to a vanishing parameter L. Using
the following relation, valid for vanishingly-small posi-
tiveL,

(where the ellipsis denote subleading terms in the limit

energy vanishes in the low-temperature limit:
lim
β→∞FI= 0. (50)For the sake of convenience, we present here the ex-
pressions for the normalized Casimir free energy and the
Casimir pressure, respectively:
FCas=−PCas=1

which coincides with the first term in Eq. (48). The ther-
modynamic contribution (48) does not contain the zero-
point energy since the latter should diverge in the L→0
limit (51), which is not the case (50). Therefore, Eq. (48)
represents a purely thermodynamic contribution.
D. Fractalization of thermodynamics
Using the property η(−z∗) = [ η(z)]∗valid for any
complex number zfrom the upper complex semi-plane,
Imz > 0, one gets for the thermodynamic part of the
free energy density (48), the following expression:
FI=π

where we used the notations in (47).
The thermodynamic limit, L→ ∞ , of the free energy
on the ring (52) can be deduced from the beautiful result
of Ref. [43], which relates the Dedekind ηfunction (46)
with the Thomae fTfunction (15) as the following limit:
lim
ϵ→+0ϵ|η(x+iϵ)|=−π
12f2
T(x). (53)
Applying (53) to the thermal part of the free energy
density (52), we get that the (normalized) thermody-
namic energy density “fractalizes” in the thermodynamic
limit:
lim
L→∞FI=−PI=−π
6β2f2
T(ν). (54)
The non-analyticity of the Thomae function fThas a
fractal nature [43] implying the fractalization of thermo-
dynamics under imaginary rotation [32]. The result in
Eq. (54) implies that close to the thermodynamic limit,
L≫1, the non-analytical fractal part of the free energy
density dominates over the analytical term in the ther-
modynamic free energy (52). Interpreting the expression
forFin light of Eq. (17), we are led to define a rotation-
dependent temperature TT(ν) via
TT(ν) =β−1fT(ν), (55)
which depends on the statistical parameter ν≡
βΩI/2π=p/qvia the discontinuous Thomae function
fTas given in Eq. (14). Notice that in the thermody-
namic limit, the thermodynamics of the system is deter-
mined by the ninionic statistics (12). This fact can be
seen from the expression for pressure, given in Eq. (54),
which coincides with Eq. (18).9
The fractalization (54), characterized by the non-
analytical behaviour of free energy, is achieved only in
the thermodynamic limit when the radius Rof the ring
becomes infinitely large. At any finite R, all thermody-
namic characteristics of the systems are analytical. Thus,
it is instructive to see how thermodynamics acquires its
fractal properties under imaginary rotation as the radius
of the ring increases.
FIG. 5. Fractalization of thermodynamics of scalar particles
on the ring under the imaginary rotation Ω I: free energy den-
sity−FIEq. (48), shown in units of pressure P0for an infinite
ringL→ ∞ in the absence of rotation, Eq. (17), as a function
of the normalized statistical angle ν=χ/(2π)≡βΩI/(2π) for
various (normalized) lengths Lof the ring (47). The plots at
finite values of Lare given for the analytical behaviour (48)
in terms of the Dedekind ηfunction (46). The behaviour in
the thermodynamic limit, L→ ∞ , corresponds to the non-
analytical fractal result (54) expressed via the Thomae func-
tion (15). The behaviour near the points ν= 0 and ν= 1 is
not shown to preserve a convenient vertical scale.
In Fig. 5 we show the average free energy of bosons (48)
as a function of the normalized statistical angle ν,
Eq. (47), at various (normalized) lengths Lof the ring.
Pressure, which is a smooth analytical function of νat
small radius of the ring, develops a series of minima and
maxima as the length of the ring increases. For large
sizes L∼103, pressure of bosonic particles develops self-
similar features. At L∼5×103, the pressure becomes
almost indistinguishable from its limiting form ( L→ ∞ )
given by Eq. (18) and governed by the fractal properties
of the Thomae function (15). In this limit, the thermody-
namic pressure becomes a fractal dictated by the ninionic
statistics (12).
To see how the other thermodynamic quantities frac-
talize in the imaginary rotation case, it is convenient to
rewrite the free energy in Eq. (44), as follows. Employinga series expansion of the Bose-Einstein factor,

where we introduced MI=−iM=∂FI/∂ΩI, while
SI=β(PI−FI) + 2 πνMI. Using Eq. (24), it can be
shown that EI=PI.
To reveal the fractal features of the expressions in
Eqs. (58) and (59), we consider νto be a rational
number, represented by the irreducible fraction ν=
p/q. Then, the trigonometric function sin2(πjν) and
sin(πjν) cos( πjν) have a periodicity with respect to j→
j+q. To take advantage of this periodicity, we write
j=qQ+j′, with 0 ≤Q <∞and 1 ≤j′≤q, covering
the entire 1 ≤j <∞summation range. Out of the new
range for j′, the value j′=qis special, since then the
trigonometric functions vanish:
sin(πjν)|j=q(Q+1)= sin[ πp(Q+ 1)] = 0 .(60)
In what follows, we split our observables A ∈
{FI,PI,MI,SI,EI}as
A=Aq+δA, (61)
where Aqcorresponds to the j′=qcontribution and δA
collects all terms with 1 ≤j′< q. In particular, we have

The presence of the denominator qof the irreducible frac-
tionp/q=νin Eqs. (62)–(63) is the hallmark of fractal
thermodynamics and hence of loss of analyticity.
The remainders δAin Eq. (61) play the role of “de-
fractalizing” the expectation values Afor small systems
(small L). At large L, it is not difficult to see that δA
decays to 0. For example, in the case of the free energy,
we have

δFI≃q−1

Fig. 6. Strikingly, the shape coefficients K2n(L) exceed
their thermodynamic limit, K2n(L)> K 2n(∞) = 2 n!,

E. Analytical continuation: the disk of analyticity
Finally, let us discuss how the fractalization of ther-
modynamics in the thermodynamic limit leads to the ab-
sence of the analytical continuation from the imaginary
angular frequencies to the real ones. In other words, we
would like to see that the thermodynamic quantities ob-
tained in an infinite volume limit at imaginary rotation
cannot be directly connected to the thermodynamics of
real rotation. Qualitatively, the validity of this statement
can be deduced from both mathematical and physical ar-
guments.
Mathematically, it is clear that a non-analytical func-
tion cannot be analytically continued to an analytical
domain because the result will depend on the prescrip-
tion used for the continuation procedure. Moreover, at

corresponds to the anayltical estimates in Eqs. (80) and (81).
the imaginary-rotating side in the thermodynamic limit,
the pressure Pcannot be expressed as a function of the
imaginary velocity squared, Ω2
I, Eq. (18), which renders
inapplicable the continuation prescription to the real ro-
tation summarized in Eq. (6).
Physically, the causality condition (42) is incompatible
with the continuation prescription (6) in the thermody-
namic limit, R→ ∞ , for any finite Ω I. However, outside
of the thermodynamic limit at any finite R, the analyt-
ical continuation does exist. Let us briefly discuss this
point for the example of the ring.
Since the length of the ring is always a positive num-
ber,L >0, the argument of the Dedekind ηfunction in
the free energy density (52) always belongs to the upper
part of the complex plane, where the Dedekind function
is an analytical and well-defined function. Therefore, the
imaginary rotation is well-defined at any imaginary an-
gular frequency ν, contrary to its real counterpart (45).
It is convenient to write explicitly the normalized free
energies β2Ffor real ( FRe) and imaginary ( FIm) angu-
lar frequencies, respectively:
β2FRe(xR, y) =πy2
6+ylnh
η(ixR+iy)η(−ixR+iy)
,
(82)
β2FIm(xI, y) =πy2
6+yln
η(xI+iy)η(−xI+iy)
.
(83)12
Here we defined the following real-valued quantities:
xR=βΩ
2π, x I=βΩI
2π, y =β
2πR, (84)
which represent the normalized angular frequencies for
real and imaginary rotation ( xRandxI, respectively),
and the inverse size of the ring y > 0. The analytical
continuation can be formulated in terms of the relation
between (82) and (83).
Despite similarity of Eqs. (82) and (83), these quan-
tities have different properties. The free energy for real
rotation (82) is defined only in the strip −y < x R< y
because the Dedekind eta function is defined only in the
upper part of the complex plane (excluding the real axis).
Physically, the same condition coincides with the causal-
ity requirement (42). The pressure of the gas under imag-
inary rotation (83) is defined for any real-valued xI∈R.
Equations (82) and (83) can be written in the following
unified form:
β2F(z, z0) =−πz2
0
6+ylnh
η(iz+z0)η(−iz+z0)
,
(85)
with
z=xR+ixI≡β(Ω + iΩI)
2π, z 0=iy≡i
L.(86)
For any y >0, the analyticity properties of the free en-
ergy density at real rotation (82) imply that function (85)
can be expanded in a series of powers of zaround the
point z= 0 in the disk |z|<|z0|of radius |z0|=y >0. In
the original notations, the disk of analyticity can be de-
fined as the generalization of the causality condition (42)
in the plane of complex angular frequencies:

R2<1. (87)
The free energy Fcan be written as the following series
F(z, z0) =∞X

One can check explicitly that the coefficients of the se-
ries (88) diverge in the thermodynamic limit which is
consistent with the shrinking radius of convergence (87)
asR→ ∞ . We show the first three non-zero coefficients
β2F(2n)

One can also rewrite the free energy (88) in terms of
physical variables:

and the radius of convergence in the complex Ω plane is
determined by Eq. (87): Ωc= 1/R. The radius shrinks
to zero, Ωc→0 asR→ ∞ , thus implying the absence of
the direct analytical continuation between real and imag-
inary angular frequencies in the thermodynamic limit.
Thus, thermodynamics of an infinite-volume system sub-
jected to imaginary rotation is not directly connected to
the thermodynamics of real rotation.
F. How fractalization emerges as volume grows
Figure 5 shows that at any fixed statistical angle
χ= 2πν(or, equivalently, at any imaginary frequency
ΩI) and any finite radius L, the free energy is described
by a smooth analytical function of χ. For a rational nor-
malized angle ν=p/qwith coprime integer numbers p
andq(0< p < q ), the pressure depends both on the
numerator pand the denominator q(we remind that in
these units, Ω I= (2π/β)p/q). However, as the length
Lof the ring increases, the pressure turns into a fractal,
implying that it loses the sensitivity to the numerator
pand keeps only the dependence on the denominator q
that defines the imaginary frequency.
This curious fractalization transition is shown in Fig. 8
for the particular set of imaginary frequencies Ω I≡
2πν/β =pπ/(5β) with p= 0,1, . . . , 9. Given the pe-
riodicity (10) under ν→ν+ 1, as well the reflec-
tion symmetry (11) with respect to ν→ − ν, applied
to the pressure, this particular choice leaves us with
six distinct values of the normalized statistical angle:
ν= 0/10,1/10, . . . , 5/10.
At small and moderate ring sizes up to L≃4, the free
energy F=F(L, ν) depends on the normalized statisti-
cal angle νmonotonically, with −F(L, νa)<−F(L, νb)13

function (15). The inset shows the zoom in on the small-radius region.

words, in the analytical region, the thermodynamics of
the system behaves analytically, exhibiting a dependence
on the actual value of the rational-valued normalized sta-
tistical angle and not on its numerator or denominator
separately.
As we have seen above, the transition to the fractal
regime is associated with the loss of the analytical con-
tinuation from imaginary to real rotation. For purely
imaginary rotation, the convergence segment (87) for the
variable νis defined by the condition:
|ν|L <1, (93)
implying that for the largest value, ν= 1/2, the non-
analytical regime should come into play at the ring length
L= 2, while for the smallest nonzero value, ν= 1/10,
the critical length is larger, L= 10. This region of the
lengths – shown in the inset of Fig. 8 – is characterized
by the breaking of the monotonic behavior of pressure on
the statistical angle, which is a precursor of the fractal
features observed at larger lengths of the ring.
At higher values of L, the behavior of pressure on νbe-
comes more peculiar. To see this in detail, it is convenient
to start from the non-rotating case, ν= 0/10 = 0, and
associate it to the pair ( p, q) = (1 ,1) since ν= 0/10≡0
andν= 1/1≡1 correspond to the same static case re-
lated to each other by the translation symmetry, ν→
ν+ 1. The ν= 0 pressure, characterized by the de-
nominator q= 1, is shared both by real, Ω = 0, and
imaginary, Ω I= 0, static cases. In Fig. 5, it provides us
with a benchmark value for the pressure in the large- L
limit.The values of the statistical angle ν= 1/10 and
ν= 3/10 correspond to rotations with different imagi-
nary angular frequencies Ω I=π/(5β) and 3 π/(5β), re-
spectively, but they share the same denominator q= 10.
According to the fractalization property (14), both these
cases – which are characterized by the pairs of coprimes
(p, q) = (1 ,10) and ( p, q) = (3 ,10), respectively – should
correspond, in the thermodynamic limit, to the pressure
of free bosonic gas at the same temperature T= 1/(10β)
which is ten times smaller than the temperature in the
non-rotating Ω I= 0 ( ν= 0) case. The pressure for
ν= 1/10 and ν= 3/10 is, consequently, 1 /q2≡1/100
of the gas pressure in the absence of imaginary rotation.
The described features are clearly seen in Fig. 5: the
ν= 1/10 and ν= 3/10 pressures, very different at low
L∼1, start to approach each other at L∼10, converging
into a single curve already at L∼50. This asymptotic
behaviour has fractal features as the thermodynamics of
the gas is sensitive only to the denominator of the ratio-
nal (properly normalized) angular frequency.
The cases ν= 2/10≡1/5 and ν= 4/10≡2/5 cor-
respond to the coprime pairs ( p, q) = (1 ,5) and ( p, q) =
(2,5) that share the same denominator q= 5. The pres-
sure for these imaginary angular frequencies collapse to
a single line even earlier, at L∼7, as it can be seen from
the inset of Fig. 8. In both cases, pressure approaches the
result for a free bosonic gas with temperature T= 1/(5β)
which is q2= 25 times smaller than the pressure of the
non-rotating gas.
Finally, the normalized statistical angle ν= 5/10≡
1/2 gives the denominator q= 2, temperature T=
1/(2β) and a gas pressure which is q2= 4 times smaller14
than the one of the non-rotating gas.

as it is clearly seen in Fig. 5.
G. Negative thermodynamic pressure of ninions
Apart from the fractal features of the thermody-
namic limit – already anticipated from the analytical ap-
proach discussed earlier – the pressure at finite volumes
L∼1. . .10 appears to possess an unexpected feature.
Namely, there are regions of the statistical angle χwhere
the thermal contribution to pressure is negative, as it is
clearly seen in Fig. 5. In this sense, the “ninions” – the
auxiliary particles which are associated with the ninionic
deformation of the standard statistical distribution (12)
– provide us with the similar phenomenon as the Casimir
effect with one important difference: the negative “nin-
ionic” pressure is produced by thermal, and not quantum,
fluctuations. As temperature rises, the negative pressure
rises as well.
The effect of the negative pressure appears in the an-
alytical region (93) as it is seen in Fig. 8 and especially
in the inset of this figure. This unusual behavior is an
exotic property of ninions which is not associated with
the fractal statistics.
H. Effect of finite particle mass
We now consider the effect of finite mass Mon the frac-
talization properties discussed in Subsec. III D. Due to
the relativistic dispersion relation ωm=p
M2+m2/R2,
the resummation of the free energy as in Eq. (57) is no
longer possible. Writing FIfor imaginary rotation pa-
rameter Ω = iΩIdirectly from Eq. (44) gives
FI=1
β∞X
m=1lnh
1−2e−βωmcos(2 πmν) +e−2βωmi
.(96)
Due to its slow convergence, the above sum is not
amenable to asymptotic analysis. Instead, we rely on
brute force to evaluate Eq. (96). It can be seen in Fig. 9
that the plateau (fractal) value is reached for any val-
ues of βM. For convenience, the plot reports the ratio
FI(L)/F0, where F0=−P0=−π/β2represents the
free energy of a boson gas [see Eq. (17)].

F0=−P0=−π/6β2[see Eq. (17)].
Finally, we analyze the effect of the particle mass M
onto the free energy in the absence of rotation, F(0, M),
and on the coefficients K2n. The relevant expressions are

Figure 10 indicates a generally decreasing trend of the
free energy density F(0, M), computed for a static sys-
tem ( ν= 0) at finite mass, with respect to its mass-
less, thermodynamic limit value, F0=−π/6β2. The
shape coefficients K2n(M) increase with Mwith respect
to their classical, massless values, K2n= (2n)!. The re-
sults are consistent with those observed in the classical
analysis shown in Fig. 3 and one can expect to reach
agreement in the thermodynamic limit, when L→ ∞ .
IV. RIGIDLY-ROTATING BOSE-EINSTEIN
DISTRIBUTION
We now move on and consider a (3+1)d rigidly-
rotating system comprised of uncharged, massless bo-
son particles. In this section, we consider such a system15

from the perspective of relativistic kinetic theory, which
is introduced briefly in Subsect. IV A. In Subsect. IV B,
we discuss the thermodynamic properties of a rigidly-
rotating system with real rotation parameter Ω, whose
properties for slow rotation are discussed in Sec. IV C.
Finally, Subsec. IV D is dedicated to the case of imagi-
nary rotation.A. Relativistic kinetic theory
Although throughout this article we consider non-
interacting bosonic systems, it is instructive to discuss,
for a brief moment, an interacting model. This approach
will allow us to elucidate thermal distributions in thermo-
dynamic equilibrium and shed some light on the physical
nature of imaginary rotating systems.
In relativistic kinetic theory, the system dynamics are
described using the relativistic Boltzmann equation [46–
48]:
kµ∂µfk=C[f], (98)
where fk≡fk(x) is the one-particle distribution function
andkµ= (k0,k) is the on-shell momentum satisfying
k2= 0. The macroscopic properties of the system can be
described using the energy-momentum tensor,
Tµν=Z
dK kµkνfk, (99)
where dK=gd3k/[(2π)3k0] is the Lorentz-invariant in-
tegration measure and the degeneracy factor of a single
neutral scalar field considered in this paper is g= 1.
The conservation law ∂µTµν= 0 demands that kµbe a
collision invariant, i.e.
Z
dKC [f]kµ= 0. (100)
The prototypical collision term is that corresponding
to 2-to-2 scattering processes [46, 49],
C2→2[f] =1
2Z
dK′dPdP′Wkk′→pp′
×(fpfp′˜fk˜fk′−fkfk′˜fp˜fp′),(101)
where ˜fk= 1 + fkis the Bose enhancement factor and
the Lorentz-invariant transition rate Wkk′→pp′can be
written in terms of the quantum-mechanical differential
cross section dσ/dΩ as
Wkk′→pp′=sdσ(s,Θs)
dΩs(2π)6δ4(k+k′−p−p′),(102)
with s= (k+k′)2and Θ sbeing the center of mass
squared energy and emission angle, respectively, with
cos Θ s=(k−k′)·(p−p′)
(k−k′)2. (103)
According to the H theorem, the collision term C[f]
drives the system towards local thermal equilibrium, de-
scribed for the case of a free bosonic gas by the Bose-
Einstein distribution:
fBE
k=1
exp[uµ(x)kµ/T(x)]−1, (104)16
where T(x) is the local temperature and uµ(x) is the local
four-velocity. It is easy to check that C[f] = 0 when the
gas is in thermal equilibrium, i.e. f∗=fBE
∗for∗ ∈
{k,k′,p,p′}. In global thermal equilibrium, fk=fBE
k
at each space-time point and Eq. (98) becomes:
kµkν∂µβν(x) = 0 , (105)
where βµ(x) = uµ(x)/T(x) is the temperature four-
vector. Thus, in global equilibrium, βµsatisfies the
Killing equation, ∂µβν+∂νβµ= 0. In this paper, we
seek the solution that corresponds to rigid rotation:
βµ(Ω)∂µ=β(∂t−yΩ∂x+xΩ∂y) =β(∂t+ Ω∂φ),(106)
where Ω is the angular velocity and β= 1/T0is a con-
stant corresponding to the inverse temperature on the
rotation axis (where x=y= 0). The equilibrium distri-
bution (104) thus reads:
fBE
k(Ω) =1
exp[β(k0+ Ωkφ)]−1, (107)
where
kφ=−ρ2kφ, kφ=ρ−2(−ykx+xky), (108)
with ρ=p
x2+y2being the distance from the point at
(x, y, z ) to the rotation axis.
B. Thermodynamics of rigid rotation
We now discuss the properties of the rigidly-rotating
global equilibrium state. From the relation βµβµ=
1/T2(x), we can identify the local temperature as [47]
T(ρ) =β−1γ(ρ), γ(ρ) = (1 −ρ2Ω2)−1/2, (109)
where γ(ρ) is the Lorentz factor of a co-rotating particle
at a distance ρfrom the rotation axis. Relation (109)
corresponds to the Tolman-Ehrenfest law [50, 51], which
relates local temperature to the metric in a static gravita-
tional field, in the curvilinear background of co-rotating
reference frame. Similarly, the local four-velocity reads
uµ∂µ=γ(∂t+ Ω∂φ). (110)
Both the Lorentz factor and the local temperature
T(ρ) =γ(ρ)/βdiverge on the light cylinder, as ρΩ→1.
The energy-momentum tensor Tµν(x) can be obtained
via
Tµν=Z
dK kµkνfk= (E+P)uµuν−Pgµν.(111)
In the case of massless particles, the energy E= 3Pis
expressed via the local pressure P, which reads
P(ρ) =1
3Z
dK(k·u)2fBE
k=π2γ4(ρ)
90β4. (112)We now consider the thermodynamic limit of our
rigidly-rotating system. Identifying F(ρ) =−Pas the
local free-energy density, we consider the average free
energy F=F/Vin a cylindrical volume V=πR2Lz
of height Lzand radius R, centered on the rotation axis.
The mean free-energy density reads
F(Ω, R) =−2
R2ZR
0dρ ρ P (ρ) =−π2
90β4γ2(R).(113)
The same result can be obtained starting from the ex-
pression for the grand potential Fof relativistic bosons
in rotation [44], cf. Eq. (20),
F=1

(2π)3
×ln[1−2e−βk0cosh( βΩkφ) +e−2βk0], (114)
where Jz=−kφis the zcomponent of the particle’s an-
gular momentum. Other thermodynamic quantities can
be obtained starting from Eq. (22). Taking into account
thatV=πR2Lz, it can be seen that the radial and ver-
tical directions are not equivalent. Therefore, we replace
the term PdVby
PdV→2πRL zPRdR+πR2PzdLz, (115)
with the hydrostatic pressure obtained as the weighted
average P= (2PR+Pz)/3. Thus, the thermodynamic
pressures are given by
PR=−1
2R∂(FR2)
∂R,Pz=−F. (116)
Similarly, the average entropy S, angular momentum M,
and energy density Eare given by Eqs. (23) and (24),
respectively. We now evaluate the above quantities using
the classical expression in Eq. (113):
PR=π2
90β4γ4(R),E=π2
90β4[2γ4(R) +γ2(R)],
S=2π2
45β3γ2(R),M=π2R2Ω

where we took into account the explicit expressions for
the local hydrostatic pressure (112) and the Lorentz fac-
tor (109).17
C. Slow rotation: moment of inertia and shape
We now consider the coefficients F(0) and K2nintro-
duced in Eq. (29). Comparing Fin Eq. (113) for the
(3 + 1)d system and in Eq. (26) for the (1 + 1)d ring, it
can be seen that the Ω dependence is through the same
γ2(R) factor. Therefore, the coefficients K2nare identi-
cal to those in Eq. (30),
K2n= (2n)!, K 2n+1= 0. (120)
The average free energy in the absence of rotation eval-
uates to
F(0) =−π2
90β4. (121)
The moment of inertai in the zero-rotation limit I0eval-
uates to
I0=π2R2
45β4. (122)
The coefficient I2in the series I(Ω) = I0+I2v2
R/2 +. . .
is trivially
I2= 4I0=4π2R2
45β4. (123)
The positiveness of I2>0 implies that the rotating mat-
ter tends to increase its angular momentum with an in-
crease in angular frequency. This property signals the
change in the shape of rotating system leading to a spa-
tial redistribution of energy as a result of the rotation,
which can already be seen from Eq. (119): rotation tends
to increase the contributions to the energy density (118)
coming from the outer regions as compared to those com-
ing from the inner ones. The physical situation is some-
what similar – neglecting viscosity effects – to water ro-
tating in a glass: its moment of inertia increases with ro-
tation because the distribution of mass within the glass
changes, with the water particles moving away from the
axis of rotation, increasing the distance of each mass el-
ement from the axis, and, hence, the moment of inertia
becomes larger.
Finite-size corrections, related to the finite transverse
size of the system and, consequently, to quantization of
the transverse modes, will be discussed below in Sub-
sects. V H and VI C.
D. Imaginary rotation
We now turn to the case of imaginary rotation. Setting
Ω = iΩIwith real Ω Iis not possible directly in fBE,
because that would lead to a complex-valued distribution
function. Instead, we can consider the properties of the
system described by the distribution
fI
k=1
2
fBE
k(iΩI) +fBE
k(−iΩI)=eβkcos(βΩIkφ)−1
e2βk−2eβkcos(βΩIkφ) + 1, (124)
which is nothing but a form of the ninionic deformation
of the Bose-Einstein statistics (12). Since βµ(iΩI)∂µ=
β(∂t+iΩI∂φ) still satisfies the Killing equation, the
left-hand side of the Boltzmann equation (98) vanishes.
Somewhat unsurprisingly, the collision term on the right-
hand side of the same equation does not vanish. This can
be seen by considering the small-Ω expansion of fBE
k(Ω)
introduced in Eq. (107):
fBE
k(Ω) = f0

where f0
k≡fBE
k(Ω = 0) and ˜f0
k= 1 + f0
k. Considering
now Ω → ±iΩIand taking the average as described in
Eq. (124) gives

It can be seen that in general, C[f] does not vanish when
fk=fI
k, hinting that thermal equilibration will generi-
cally reduce the magnitude of Ω2
I.
Keeping in mind that imaginary-rotation states are
not in actual thermal equilibrium – in a sense that their
deformed distribution (124) does not have the equilib-
rium Bose-Einstein form (2) and that the collision inte-
gral (127) does not vanish – we can still derive the macro-
scopic energy-momentum tensor, which becomes now di-
agonal:
Tµν
I= diag( EI, Pρ;I, ρ−2Pφ;I, Pz;I), (128a)
with
EI=π2

I−3), (128d)18
where γI(ρ) is reminiscent of the Lorentz factor of coro-
tating particles,
γI=1p
1 +ρ2Ω2
I. (129)
Notice that the Euclidean version of the quantum
Tolman-Ehrenfest effect gives a different Lorentz fac-
tor [26]:
γTE
I=1p
1 +ρ2β−2[ΩIβ]2
2π, (130)
where [ x]2π=x+ 2πk∈(−π, π], with k∈Z, is invariant
under the 2 πsymmetry enforced by the natural period-
icity of the imaginary rotation (10). The apparent non-
compliance of the kinetic Euclidean Lorentz factor (129)
with the periodicity requirement (10) can be traced back
to the continuous nature of the angular component kφof
the momentum (108).
From a thermodynamic point of view, the struc-
ture of the energy-momentum tensor reveals an under-
lying equilibrium (perfect fluid) contribution, Tµν
pf;I=
diag( EI, PI, ρ−2PI, PI), with hydrostatic pressure PI=
EI/3, and a shear-stress tensor πµν

135β4(1−γ2
I)×diag(0 ,1,−2ρ−2,1).(131)
It is instructive to note that, on the rotation axis,
EI=E=π2/(30β4) is independent of Ω I, while at
ρ=√
3/|ΩI|, the energy density reaches 0. At larger
distances, EIdecreases to a minimum (negative) value
−π2/(9720 β4) (reached at ρ=√
5/|ΩI|) and afterwards
increases asymptotically towards its limit 0. In this large-
ρlimit, Eq. (128) shows that Tµν
Ibehaves as follows:
Tµν
I≃π2
90β4γ4
Idiag(−1,1,−3ρ−2,1), (132)
with γI∼(ρ|ΩI|)−1. Thus, far away from the rotation
axis, the azimuthal pressure becomes negative and three
times larger in magnitude than the energy density, while
the radial and vertical pressures remain positive, each
being equal in magnitude to the energy density.
We now consider the large-volume limit of our system.
The average energy inside a cylinder of radius Ris simply
EI=π2
90β4[2γ4
I(R) +γ2
I(R)], (133)
which agrees with the expression in Eq. (117) under the
substitution γ(R)→γI(R). Substituting PI=EI/3 in
Eq. (113) will clearly give a different result for the average
free energy than Fin Eq. (113). To achieve agreement up
to the substitution γ(R)→γI(R), we must replace P(ρ)
byPρ;I(ρ). This choice is supported also by the morefundamental expression for the free energy obtained by
setting Ω →iΩIin the third line of Eq. (114), i.e.
FI=Z

which is consistent with the expression in Eq. (25). Ap-
plying the thermodynamic relations in Eqs. (23) and
(116) gives expressions for quantities analogue to the sys-
tem pressure, entropy, and angular momentum:

E. Effect of finite mass
It is interesting to check how a finite particle mass
affects the properties of the rigidly-rotating boson gas.
Starting from Eq. (114), one may perform a Lorentz
transformation in the d3kintegral to the local rest frame,
such that
F=1

shape coefficients K2n(M) =d2nF(Ω, M)/dΩ2n⌋Ω=0:
F(0, M) =−M2

K4= 12K2−M4
2π2∞X
j=1K2(jMβ ). (141)

pansions

where K2n≡F(0, M)K2nandF0=−π2/90β4is the

(143)
The above estimates are validated in Fig. 11 by com-
parison to the exact formulas in Eq. (141). The results
obtained in this section for the (3+1)d system are in good
qualitative agreement with those obtained for the (1+1)d
ring (cf. Figs. 3 and 10).
V. IMAGINARY ROTATION OF THE SCALAR
FIELD VS. REAL ROTATION
A. Mode solutions
We consider a real, massless scalar field ˆϕ. The decom-
position of the field operator ˆϕ(x) reads as follows:
ˆϕ(x) =X
j[ˆajfj(x) + ˆa†
jf∗
j(x)], (144)
where fj(x) represent a complete basis of orthonormal
mode solutions of the Klein Gordon equation,
(□+m2)fj= 0. (145)
These modes are taken as eigenfunctions of the Hamil-
tonian H=i∂t, momentum component Pz=−i∂z, and
angular momentum component Jz=−i∂φ:
fj=1
2πp2ωje−iωjt+ikjz+imjφJmj(qjρ), (146)
with qj=q
ω2
j−k2
j. The one-particle operators ˆ ajsat-
isfy the canonical commutation relations,
[ˆaj,ˆaj′] = 0,[ˆaj,ˆa†
j′] =δ(j, j′), (147)
where δ(j, j′) =ω−1
jδ(ωj−ωj′)δ(kj−kj′)δmj,mj′. The
sum over the quantum numbers is abbreviated as
X
j→∞X
mj=−∞Z∞
0dωjωjZωj
−ωjdkj. (148)
In this and subsequent subsections, we pursue, for sim-
plicity, a “hybrid” quantization approach: we work in the
basis of the cylindrical waves (146) with continuous trans-
verse momentum qjwhich is typical for the unbounded
system while restricting the integral (148) over the longi-
tudinal momentum, |kj|⩽ωj, to preserve the hermiticity
of the Hamiltonian. This set of modes is not suitable to
describe rigid real rotation, since in that case, the system
must be enclosed inside a boundary in order to preserve
causality [33], as will be discussed in Sec. VI. In this sec-
tion, we will focus primarily on the study of rigid rotation
with imaginary angular velocity, for which no causality
issues arise and the set of eigenmodes presented above is
perfectly applicable.20
B. Thermal states
The statistical operator for a thermal state at inverse
temperature βwhich rotates with angular velocity Ω is
ˆρ(β,Ω) = e−β(:bH:−Ω:ˆJz:), (149)
where we took the normal-ordered operators
:bH:=X
jωjˆa†
jˆaj, :ˆJz:=X
jmjˆa†
jˆaj. (150)
Using the commutation relations
[bH,ˆa†
j] =ωjˆa†
j,[ˆJz,ˆa†
j] =mjˆa†
j, (151)
it is not difficult to establish that
ˆρˆa†
jˆρ−1=e−β˜ωjˆa†
j, (152)
where ˜ ωj≡˜ωj(Ω) = ωj−Ωmjrepresents the co-rotating
energy (3).
The thermal expectation value (t.e.v.) of an arbitrary
operator bA(x) is
A(x)≡ ⟨bA(x)⟩=Z−1Tr[ˆρbA(x)], (153)
where Z= Tr(ˆ ρ) is the partition function. Using
Eq. (152), the t.e.v. of the product of two one-particle
operators can be seen to satisfy
⟨ˆa†
jˆaj′⟩=e−β˜ωj⟨ˆaj′ˆa†
j⟩. (154)
Using the commutation relations in Eq. (151), we estab-
lish
⟨ˆa†
jˆaj′⟩=δ(j, j′)
eβ˜ωj−1. (155)

Considering now the conformal energy-momentum ten-
sor, defined classically as [52]
Tµν=2
3∇µϕ∇νϕ−1
3ϕ∇µ∇νϕ−1
6gµν(∇ϕ)2,(158)
2For brevity, we use the term “condensate” although the expecta-
tion value of the ordered operator ˆϕ2does not imply the presence
of a nonvanishing coherent condensate ⟨ϕ⟩.its expectation value Tµν=⟨:bTµν:⟩can be expressed as
Ttt=G200+1

G(1)
000=ρdG000
dρ, G(2)
000=ρd
dρρdG000
dρ, (160)
while all other components vanish.
Turning back to the definition of the functions Gabc
in Eq. (156), we immediately notice divergences asso-
ciated with the Bose-Einstein factor [ eβ˜ω−1]−1. For
each value of msuch that Ω m > 0, there will be a value
ofωwhere this factor diverges. The only notable ex-
ception is the rotation axis, where J2
m(qρ) =δm0and
[eβω−1]−1has the usual Bose-Einstein infrared diver-
gence when ω= 0. Thus, we are led to conclude that
thermal rigidly-rotating states of the scalar field are ill-
defined at each point outside the rotation axis due to long
wavelength (super-horizon) modes, for which ω≤Ωm
[53]. We will come back to this issue in Sec. VI when
we will discuss the Klein-Gordon field enclosed inside a
cylindrical boundary.
C. Evaluation for imaginary rotation
We now seek to construct states which undergo imag-
inary rotation, Ω = iΩI, where Ω I∈R. As also noted
in Sec. IV D, a state under imaginary rotation leads to
complex expectation values of physical observables. This
problem can be alleviated by considering the hermiticized
version of ˆ ρ, namely
ˆρ(β,Ω)→1
2[ˆρ(β,Ω) + ˆ ρ†(β,Ω)], (161)
which is equivalent to averaging over the results obtained
for positive and negative values of Ω I. Under the above
hermitization, the t.e.v. in Eq. (155) becomes
⟨ˆa†
jˆaj′⟩β=eβωjcos(βΩImj)−1
e2βωj−2eβωjcos(βΩImj) + 1δ(j, j′),(162)
which is similar to the relativistic kinetic theory distri-
bution fim
kin Eq. (124) under the substitution kφ→
−mj. The thermodynamic state corresponding to the
t.e.v. (162) is characterized by ninionic statistics (12). In21
what follows, we perform the calculations considering av-
erages using the statistical operator ˆ ρ(β, iΩI), keeping in
mind that the final result is obtained by taking the real
part.
In order to analyse the functions GI
abc, obtained by
replacing Ω →iΩIin Eq. (156), the Bose-Einstein factor
can be expanded in a power series, as follows:
1
eβ˜ω−1=∞X
j=1e−jβ˜ω, (163)
where ˜ ω=ω−iΩImhas a positive real part, ω > 0.
Writing

taking derivatives with respect to the rotation parameter:

spect to ν→ − ν. Under the hermitization (161), it is
clear that Ttφ

The structure of the above result is similar to that ob-
tained in Eq. (132), with the important difference that
the quantum field-theoretical (QFT) Tµν
Idepends on ν
through the harmonic function sin( πjν). This property
implies that Tµν
Iobtained in QFT is periodic with respect
toν, with period ∆ ν= 1, in agreement with the sym-
metry (10) expected on general grounds. This periodic
behaviour is fundamentally different from that observed
in RKT (Subsect. IV D), where no periodicity in νcan
be seen.
D. Values on the rotation axis: no analytical
connection between real and imaginary rotations
On the rotation axis, we have αj= 0. Using the rela-
tionsP∞
j=1j−2=π2/6 andP∞
j=1j−4=π4/90, we find
that the expectation value of ϕ2is not affected by the
imaginary rotation while the energy-momentum tensor
acquires a nontrivial dependence on the imaginary angu-
lar frequency:

It is remarkable to observe that the diagonal components
ofTµνsatisfy
Tµν(νR=±1) = Tµν(νR= 0) for µ=ν , (191)
however contrary to the same quantities evaluated under
imaginary rotations, they do not exhibit periodicity with
respect to νR. Figure 12(b) shows that when |νR|>1,
Tzzincreases dramatically, while TttandTρρ=ρ2Tφφ
eventually become negative. The dashed lines extending
in the region |νR|>1 indicate the expected behaviour if
Tµνwere periodic with respect to νR.
Before ending this subsection, we remark that the pres-
ence of odd powers of νin the expressions for Tµν
Iis
unexpected and seemingly unsupported by the formulas
in Eq. (181). For example, in the case of Ttt
Igiven by
Eq. (181b), a Taylor expansion of the summand around
ν= 0 fails to capture the ν3term revealed in Eq. (184b).
Moreover, since νalways appears multiplied by the sum-
mation variable j, such an approach can reliably produce
only the first two terms, proportional to j−4ν0andj−2ν2.
The third term proportional to j0ν4cannot be computed
due to the divergence of the sum over j. We are thus led
to believe that the ν3term appearing in Eq. (184) is re-
lated to an inherent non-analytic behavior of Tµν
Iwith
respect to the rotation parameter ν. We remark that the
results quoted in Eqs. (189) for the case of real rotation
were obtained also using a Taylor series approach and
may therefore omit similar non-analytical ν3
R-like terms.
E. High temperature expansion
Let us now consider the large temperature expansion,
when β→0. Since βcomes multiplied by junder the
summation sign in Eqs. (181), higher-order terms with
respect to βcome with higher powers of j. Since the
summation over jand the power series with respect to
jβin general do not commute, this procedure allows only
the coefficients of the β−4andβ−2terms to be extracted.

As discussed in the previous subsection, the ν3terms
revealed in Eq. (184) are not captured by the pertur-
bative series expansion approach. Nevertheless, the re-
sults reported in Eq. (192) are fully consistent with pre-
viously derived results, see Eq. (4.2.51) of Ref. [56];
Eqs. (A.21,A.22) of Ref. [58]; and Eqs. (7.19,7.22,7.23)
of Ref. [59].F. Emergence of fractal structure
We now consider the case when ν=p/qis a rational
number, where p/qis an irreducible fraction, as discussed
in Sec. III D. Writing j=Qq+j′, with 0 ≤Q <∞and
1≤j′≤q, the trigonometric functions taking as argu-
ment jπν=πpQ+j′πp/q depend only on j′. Specifically,
Eq. (181) becomes

as functions of dimensionless distance l=ρ/(2πβ) from the rotation axis of the cylinder. The lines and points show results
for rational values of ν=βΩI/2πof the form r/10, with 0 ≤r≤5, corresponding to irreducible fractions p/qwith q= 1,
2, 5 and 10, which are identical to the imaginary frequencies used for the rotating ring in Fig. 8. The horizontal dashed
black lines represent the expected large-distance plateau given by (a) 1 /q2and (b) 1 /q4, which signal the fractal behaviour of
thermodynamics. The gray dotted lines represent the relativistic kinetic theory prediction in Eq. (128b). A small segment of
the result for Tttwhen p/q= 1/10 corresponds to negative values and is represented with dashed lines. The values are obtained
using Eq. (200).
ψ(x) = Γ′(x)/Γ(x) is the digamma function and the
primes denote differentiation with respect to the argu-
ment, e.g. ψ′′(x) =d2ψ(x)/dx2. Also, Im and Re denote
the real and imaginary parts of their arguments, respec-
tively: Im ψj=1

j) and Re ψ′
j=1

j=ψ(j

When considering the summation over jappearing in
Eq. (193), a special case corresponds to j=q, when
the sine term sj= sin( πjp/q ) cancels. In this case, we26
employ

Since sj= 0 implies also xj= 0, Eqs. (193) show that the
j=qcontribution becomes l-independent. This allows
all expectation values to be split as

The factor qrepresents the denominator of the irreducible
fraction ν=p/q. More importantly, because these terms
are independent of the transverse distance to the rotation
axis given by l, they become dominant at large distances
from the rotation axis, giving rise to fractal structures
in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. It is note-
worthy that the fractal terms are completely absent in
the relativistic kinetic theory analysis in Sec. IV D and
thus represent a purely quantum effect.
The second terms in Eq. (198) “defractalize” the result
close to the rotation axis and are computed via:

(b) of Fig. 13, respectively, where we consider the cases
ν=p′/10 with 0 ≤p′≤5, corresponding to irreducible
fractions p/qwith q= 1, 2, 5 and 10. As l >1, visible
differences between the curves corresponding to various
values of νcan be seen. Contrary to the classical case
shown in Eq. (132), the far-field behavior of ϕ2
IandTµν
I
is dominated by quantum effects. An estimate of how
these observables approach their asymptotic values ϕ2
q
andTµν
qcan be obtained by considering the decay of
the “classical” part from Eq. (132) to values of the same
order of magnitude as ϕ2
qandTµν
q, which occurs at values
l≳lq, where
lq∼q
ν=q2
p. (202)
Theq2dependence of lqis confirmed for both ϕ2
IandTtt
I,
however the pdependence appears to be negligible. The
emerging fractal behaviour exhibits a stark contrast to
the classical result in Eq. (128b) derived within relativis-
tic kinetic theory, which is also shown in Fig. 13(b) using
dashed gray lines. Sizeable deviations can be seen for the
curves with smaller value of q, which reach the fractalized
plateau at smaller values of L. In the p/q= 1/10 case,
the RKT curve follows closely the QFT one, providing a
good approximation also in the region where Ttt
Ibecomes
negative. Noting that the RKT result for p/q= 3/10
falls off too rapidly compared to the QFT curve leads us
to conclude that the classical RKT description becomes
valid only in the limit ν→0.
As discussed above, the fractal behaviour manifests
itself at large distances from the rotation axis, i.e., as
l→ ∞ . Figure 14 illustrates the expectation values

lower bounds (left) 1 /q2and (right) 1 /q4with q= 20. This figure should be compared with Fig. 5 for particles in the ring:
As the distance lto the rotation axis grows, the thermal expectation values get fractal features similar to the fractalization of
thermodynamics of scalar particles in the ring.28

using green squares, obtained as:
νj=j

where −0.01< δν j<0.01 is a random number.3In order
to employ a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis, we rep-
resented the absolute values of our observables, with the
convention that filled and empty symbols are used when
the observables are positive and negative, respectively.
Since ϕ2
I>0 for all values of νandl, this discussion
applies only to Ttt
I(see, e.g., the ( p, q) = (1 ,10) curve in
Fig. 13).
Forl≲1, both ϕ2
IandTtt
Iexhibit a smooth depen-
dence on ν. As lis increased, the expectation values for
the case when ν=p/qis an irreducible fraction become
frozen on their corresponding asymptotic values (1 /q2for
ϕ2
I/ϕ2
0and 1 /q4forTtt
I/Ttt
0), earlier for smaller values of
qthan for larger values of q. In contrast, the expecta-
tion values corresponding to the irrational values of ν
continue their decreasing trend towards 0.
Strikingly, the thermodynamics of the scalar field in
the (3+1)d cylindrically symmetric space, obtained nu-
merically and shown in Fig. 14, resembles drastically the
one at the ring, obtained analytically and represented in
Fig. 5, with the fractalization features becoming more
pronounced as the distance lto the rotation axis is in-
creased.
G. Thermodynamic limit
For the purpose of analyzing the large-volume limit
of our system, we consider a fictitious cylinder of radius
R≡βL/2πand of large vertical extent Lz, centered on
the rotation axis. The volume-averaged scalar conden-
sate and energy density can be computed by integrating
Eqs. (198), (200a) and (200b) over this cylinder and di-
viding by the total volume V=πR2Lz:

require taking derivatives of FIwith respect to βand Ω I
at constant Ω Iandβ, respectively. This is not possible
at the level of the fractalized form in Eq. (206). Thus,

where we took into account that Ω2
I→ −Ω2for the pur-
pose of extracting K2n. We also employed the notation
K2n≡F(0)K2n.
The leading term F(0) and the first coefficient K2,
which corresponds to the dimensionless moment of iner-
tia, can be computed exactly:
F(0) =−π2

In the case of the rotational shape coefficient K4, the
summation of the coefficient of L−4cannot be performed.
However, its leading-order behavior and the first L-
dependent correction can be extracted as follows:
K4= 24 +216
L2+. . . . (219)
Comparing Eqs. (218)–(219) to (30) [see also Eq. (120)],
we see that the classical result K2n= (2n)! receives L-
dependent corrections that vanish as the transverse size
of the cylinder becomes infinite, L→ ∞ . As in the case of
the (1+1) dring, shown in Fig. 6 [see also Eq. (81)], both
K2(L) and K4(L) exceed at finite Ltheir thermodynamic
limits, K2n(∞) = (2 n)!.
In Subsect. VI C, we discuss the dimensionless moment
of inertia K2and the rotational shape change coefficient30
K4in a cylinder of a finite radius, taking into account the
proper quantization of the radial modes. We will see that
the behaviour of K2qualitatively agrees with Eq. (218)
while the coefficient K4becomes finite and converges to
the classical result (120) in the infinite volume limit.
I. Effect of finite mass
In this subsection, we discuss the effect of a finite mass
on the fractalization of thermodynamics (seen at the level
of the local observables), as well as on the slow rota-
tion coefficients, K2n. For this purpose, we start the
analysis with the component Ttt
I, which is still given by
Eq. (159a). The only difference is that the ωintegration
in the functions GI

from ω=M,

caseb= 0, which is relevant to the computation of Ttt

theθintegral can be performed using Eq. (174a):

tation parameter takes the values ν=p′/10, with 0 ≤p′≤5,
leading to irreducible fractions p/qwith q∈ {2,5,10}. The
dotted colored lines and points correspond to regions where
Ttt
I(M)<0, while the dashed black lines represent the ther-
modynamic limit derived in Eq. (225).
To study the fractal properties of Ttt
I, we consider a ra-
tional rotation parameter, ν=p/q, with p < q being ir-
reducible coprime numbers, and write j=qQ+j′, with
1≤j′≤qand 0 ≤Q <∞. Since αj=l

The results of the numerical evaluation of Ttt

large- Lvalue coincides with the expression in Eq. (225),
shown with horizontal dotted black lines.

The integral with respect to xcan be performed exactly
for all terms displayed above. However, the x−1factors
appearing in the L−2andL−4terms (which vanish in
the thermodynamic limit) lead to results in terms of the
exponential integral function, Ei( −jβM ), which makes
analytical manipulations difficult. Instead, we focus on
the leading-order contributions, for which we get
Ej;0=e−jβM

limit L→ ∞ was taken.
The summation over jcan be performed in Eq. (229) in
terms of the polylogarithm functions. However, at this
stage we can already obtain the coefficients of the free

We now enclose the system inside a cylindrical sur-
face at a distance Rfrom the symmetry axis. Impos-
ing Dirichlet boundary conditions on the eigenmodes fj
leads to the quantization of the transverse momentum in

FIG. 16. Same as Fig. 13 for the case when the system is enclosed within cylindrical boundaries of three different sizes, shown
using vertical dotted lines, located such that L= 2πR/β = 10, 100 and 1000. The black dashed lines represent the results
obtained in the unbounded case, shown in Fig. 13.
B. Scalar condensate, energy-momentum
expectation values and fractalization
Figure 16 shows the main features of ϕ2
I(top panel) and
Ttt
I(lower panel) as functions of l= 2πρ/β for several
different radii Rchosen such that the quantity
L=2πR
β(238)
takes the values L= 10, 100, and 1000. Only the case
of rational (imaginary) rotation parameter is considered,with ν=βΩI/2π=p′/10 and 0 ≤p′≤5, giving rise to
all irreducible fractions p/q≤1/2 with q= 1, 2, 5, and
10. The dashed black lines represent the results obtained
in the unbounded case, computed based on Eqs. (198),
(200a), and (200b). As expected, the Dirichlet bound-
ary conditions considered in this section affect the be-
haviour of the observables close to the boundary. Specif-
ically, ϕ2
I= 0 when ρ=R, since GI
000(ρ=R) van-
ishes identically by virtue of the quantization condition
Jm(qmnR) = 0; while Ttt
Iis decreased by about a factor
of 10 compared to its bulk value. In both panels, the33
bounded and unbounded results stay in good agreement
throughout most of the cylinder if Lis sufficiently large.
In particular, ϕ2
Iexhibits a notably smaller value on the
rotation axis when L= 10 compared to the unbounded
case, while for the L= 100 and 1000 cases, good agree-
ment can be seen.
As mentioned in Sec. V B, the boundary permits the
study of a system undergoing real rigid rotation, as long
as ΩR=νL≤1 and the light cylinder is excluded from
the system. It is thus interesting to compare expecta-
tion values computed for imaginary and real rotation,
νIandνR. To keep the comparison meaningful, both
νIandνRare restricted to be lower than or equal to
1/L. Fig. 17 shows the radial profile Ttt(ρ) for three
cylinders, with L = 1 (a), 10 (b) and 100 (c), in the
case of slow ( νL= 0.1, blue), medium ( νL= 0.5, red)
and fast ( νL= 1, green) rotation. At small L= 2πR/β ,
the boundary effects dominate over thermal ones and Ttt
decreases monotonically from the rotation axis towards
the boundary. Furthermore, Ttt(ρ= 0) is strongly sup-
pressed (by four orders of magnitude at L= 1) compared
to its value for a boson gas at rest, Ttt
0=π2/30β4. The
effect of imaginary rotation is negligible, while in the case
of real rotation, Ttt(ρ) increases slightly at νL= 1. At
L≳10, the bulk of the system is dominated by ther-
mal effects. Panels (b) and (c) also show the RKT result
forTtt:
Ttt
cl=π2γ4
90β4(4γ2−1), Ttt

I
90β4(4γ2
I−1),(239)
where γ2= 1/(1−ν2
Rl2) and γ2
I= 1/(1 +ν2
Il2). In the
case when L= 100, the QFT results deviate from the
RKT ones only in a small vicinity of the boundary. Such
good agreement is also a consequence of the fact that at
large L,νis constrained to be small. As discussed in
Sec. V F, RKT is expected to agree with QFT for small
values of νand sufficiently far from the boundary (see
also Fig. 13.
Next, the value of Ttt(ρ= 0;ν) on the rotation axis
for both real and imaginary rotation is shown in Fig. 18
for (a) L= 1, (b) L= 10 and (c) L= 100. As be-
fore, in the case L= 1, the value of Tttis suppressed
by over three orders of magnitude. Here, the rotation
parameter covers an entire period of the system under-
going imaginary rotation. In the case of real rotation,
no such periodicity arises, contrary to the expectation
based on the result in Eq. (189b) for the unbounded case.
The inset in panel (a) shows the effect of rotation on
Ttt(ρ= 0;ν) for smaller values of ν. It can be seen that
forν≲0.1, the quantity |Ttt(ν)−Ttt(0)|has the same
behavior for both real and imaginary rotation. At L= 10
and 100, Ttt(ρ= 0;ν= 0) approaches Ttt
0=π2/30β4.
The maximum value of νis greatly reduced. It can be
seen that for such a small interval of ν, the result cor-
responding to imaginary rotation is approximately equal
to that obtained for real rotation, mirrored with respect
to the value Ttt(ρ= 0;ν= 0) obtained in the absence
of rotation, as shown with black dotted lines. Further-more, the red dotted lines indicate the analytical pre-
dictions in Eqs. (184b) and (189b), scaled by the value
Ttt(ρ= 0, ν= 0)/Ttt
0on the rotation axis in the ab-
sence of rotation, corresponding to the given value of L.
The agreement with the analytical predictions is better
at larger values of L, which may also be due to the smaller
range allowed for ν.
We now consider the thermodynamic system as a whole
and discuss the volume-averaged free energy F=F/V,
computed via the equivalent of Eq. (114):

The blue solid and dashed lines with squares denote results for the case of real and imaginary rotation, respectively. The
black dashed lines in panels (b) and (c) are obtained by reflecting the results corresponding to real and imaginary rotation
with respect to the value Ttt(ρ= 0;ν= 0) obtained in the absence of rotation. The red dotted line represents the analytical
expressions from the unbounded case, given in Eqs. (184b) and (189b), scaled by Ttt(ρ= 0;ν= 0).

the radius of the bounding cylinder. The dotted black
lines represent the same quantities computed for the un-
bounded system using Eqs. (204a) and (204b) for the
same value of L. For L≲10, the boundary effects lead
to strong quenching of all five observables, such that they
tend to 0 as L→0 in the bounded case. This is contrary
to the unbounded case, where the L→0 limit is finite.

Finally, we discuss the expansion in Eq. (29) of the

particular, we focus on the free energy in the absence of
rotation, F(0), as well as the first two coefficients, K2
(related to the moment of inertia) and K4(related to
rotation-induced deformability), which we evaluate us-36

where K2n=K2nF(0). The coefficients F(0),K2and
K4are studied as functions of the transverse size of the
system Lwith respect to their unbounded counterparts.
The ratios F(0)/F0,K2/2! and K4/4! are represented
in Fig. 21, where the denominators of these expressions
are the classical expectations given in Eq. (120). As
we already noted in Subsect. IV C, a strong quenching
due to the boundary can be seen at small values of L,
which is however less pronounced for the shape coeffi-
cient K4compared to the moment of inertia coefficient
K2and the average free energy F0. At L= 100, these
coefficients already reach their expected asymptotic val-
uesK2n= (2n)!, Eq. (120). Surprisingly, both K2(L)
andK4(L) evaluated at finite Lare smaller than their
asymptotic values, K2n(∞) = (2 n)!. This property is
in contrast to the behaviour seen for the (1 + 1)d ring
[see Fig. 6 and Eq. (81)] and in the unbounded case [see
Eqs. (218)–(219)]. It remains an open question whether
this feature remains robust when other boundary condi-
tions (e.g., von Neumann) are considered.
In a cylinder of a finite radius R, a large-size L→ ∞
limit corresponds also to the high-temperature limit,
T→ ∞ since L= 2πR/β ≡2πRT. Figure 21 shows
that the dimensionless moment of inertia K2approaches
the asymptotic value K2= 2 from below, indicating that
the moment of inertia should decrease as temperature de-
creases. This effect is related to the presence of an effec-37
tive energy gap between the states with zero, m= 0, and
non-zero, m̸= 0, orbital momenta due to the finite size
of the system. Therefore, at lower temperatures, the sys-
tem mostly resides in the m= 0 state and the rotational
modes, which contribute to the moment of inertia (244b),
are not excited. Since the latter modes do not participate
in rotation at low T, the moment of inertia of the system
decreases as the system gets colder. This effect should
evidently also occur for K4and higher coefficients. Inter-
estingly, the same qualitative behaviour for the moment
of inertia K2is also observed in the first-principle sim-
ulations of gluon plasma in the high-temperature phase
of Yang-Mills theory: as the temperature increases, the
moment of inertia approaches the high-temperature value
K2= 2, Eq. (120), from below [27].
The above discussion indicates that the restriction in
size of the quantum system reduces the K2ncoefficients.
We now consider the behavior of the K2ncoefficients for
particles of finite mass M. As indicated in Sections III A,
III H, IV E, and V I, the K2ncoefficients increase as M
increases. In Fig. 22, we demonstrate that the same qual-
itative behavior is achieved for the spatially bounded sys-
tem.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In the present work, we studied the thermodynamic
properties of a massless scalar field subjected to rigid ro-
tation and an inter-relation of the real rotation with its
imaginary analogue. The latter concept – a rigid rotation
with an imaginary frequency [19, 23] – has a practical in-
terest since rotating systems cannot be implemented in
Euclidean path-integral formalism, suitable, for exam-
ple, for numerical first-principle calculations on the lat-
tice [17, 21, 26, 27, 30]. In this sense, rotation shares the
deficiency suffered by finite-density systems, namely the
sign problem [30], and needs to be implemented in Eu-
clidean spacetime via its imaginary version supplemented
with the subsequent analytical continuation to real an-
gular frequencies [17, 21, 27].
Using the 1 + 1-dimensional toy model of a scalar
field under rigid rotation on a ring, we explicitly demon-
strated that the analytical no-go theorem [32], which de-
scribes the impossibility of continuation of the imaginary-
angular-frequency thermodynamics to the real angular
frequencies is related to the development of the fractal-
ity of thermodynamics for the former. The result ap-
plies in the thermodynamic limit. Within this model,
thermodynamic functions such as pressure and energy
density can be expressed analytically via the Dedekind
ηfunction (46). The latter function tends to the frac-
tal, non-analytical Thomae function (15) as its argument
approaches the real axis [43], which corresponds to the
infinite-volume (thermodynamic) limit.
In the case of the (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space,
we first considered a classical description of scalar par-
ticles under rotation using relativistic kinetic theory. In

the absence of boundaries, rigid rotation with a real rota-
tion parameter leads to a violation of causality and sub-
sequent divergence of all observables on the light cylin-
der. Imaginary rotation can be described by a real dis-
tribution function only as an average of clockwise and
counterclockwise rotations, leading to a seemingly non-
equilibrium state. As expected, observables such as the
energy-momentum tensor Tµνdecrease as the distance to38
the rotation axis is increased, at a faster rate for faster
rotation.
Under the quantum field theoretical treatment, rigid
rotation with a real rotation parameter leads to the diver-
gence of Tµνat each point of the space-time, also inside
the light cylinder. Under imaginary rotation, Tµνevalu-
ated on the rotation axis can be expressed via Bernoulli
polynomials (181). Away from the rotation axis, we were
able to demonstrate the fractalization of both the field
fluctuations ϕ2and of Tµνin the case of imaginary ro-
tation, in complete analogy to the 1 + 1-dimensional toy
model discussed above. In all cases, our results exhibit a
periodicity with respect to the imaginary rotation param-
eter which is not present in the classical, kinetic analysis.
For this reason, we found agreement with kinetic theory
only in the limit of slow rotation and only in the vicinity
of the rotation axis (before fractalization sets in).
For comparison with the case of real rotation, we took
results obtained using a perturbative calculation for slow
rotation (with respect to a stationary background) and
found on the rotation axis an analytical result (189)
which can be related to the one obtained for imaginary
rotation in an essentially non-analytical way (190). We
conclude that even on the axis of rotation – which ap-
pears to be static in the rotating system – the non-
analyticity is strong and unavoidable.
We demonstrated the same analytic–non-analytical
transition using numerical calculations for the thermal
scalar field system enclosed in a cylinder, undergoing ro-
tation with imaginary angular frequencies. As the ra-
dius of the cylinder grows, the pressure becomes a non-
analytical function of temperature expressed, again, via
the Thomae function (demonstrated in Figs. 13–20). In
this limit, the boundary effects become less important
and the results obtained in the unbounded case provide a
good approximation for our observables inside the cylin-
drical boundary. For values of the rotation parameter
respecting the causality constraints (i.e., when the light
cylinder is outside the boundary), the fractalization fea-
tures do not appear in the case of imaginary rotation.
For sufficiently slow rotation and high temperature, our
numerically-obtained results are compatible with the flip
Ω2
I→ −Ω2from imaginary to real rotation, signaling the
restoration of analytical continuation in this limit.
The exotic fractalization properties discussed above
are related to a ninionic deformation (12) of statisti-
cal distributions at imaginary angular frequencies [32].
For this reason, we conclude that the results obtained
in the infinite-volume system subjected to imaginary
rotation cannot be analytically related to the proper-
ties of the physically rotating system (with a real an-
gular frequency). However, we explicitly demonstrated
both for the analytically-treatable case on the ring and
numerically-accessible case of rotating cylinder that the
imaginary rotation in a spatially bounded system in Eu-
clidean space can be continued to the real-frequency do-
main in Minkowski spacetime provided that the causality
is respected for the latter spacetime.We have also shown that for real-frequency rotation,
the dimensionless moment of inertia K2, normalized per
one degree of freedom, is equal to two, K2= 2, in
the thermodynamic limit of large radius Rof the cylin-
der (32). The quantity K2determines the correction to
the free energy (29),

, (245)
due to small nonzero angular frequency, Ω →0. This
result matches well the first-principle result of Ref. [27]
on the behavior of gluons in high-temperature limit of
Yang-Mills theory. We have also shown that in the ther-
modynamic limit, the generic expansion of the pressure
(free energy) in higher orders in angular frequency (29) is
characterized by exactly-calculable coefficients K2nwith
n= 1,2, . . ., given by identical expressions (30) for the
ring and (120) for the cylinder, which also includes the
shape coefficient K4= 4! responsible for an Ω4correction
to the pressure.
Below we summarize our main findings:
1. We demonstrated the no-go theorem [32] regarding
the impossibility of continuation of the imaginary-
angular-frequency thermodynamics to the real
angular frequencies using an analytical 1 + 1-
dimensional toy model, revealing the development
of the fractality of thermodynamics for the former.
2. Since fractalization does not show up in the classi-
cal, kinetic theory treatment of imaginary rotation,
we conclude that this is a purely quantum effect.
3. We found similar fractalization on the unbounded
Minkowski space for imaginary rotation, as well as
in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit of the
bounded system.
4. For the case of a causal boundary that excludes the
light cylinder, we were able to restore the analytical
continuation from imaginary to real rotation in the
limit of slow rotation and large temperatures.
5. We attributed the exotic fractalization properties
to a ninionic deformation (12) of statistical distri-
butions at imaginary angular frequencies [32].
6. These statements are applicable both for massless
and massive fields, with the fractal features become
pronounced in the thermodynamic limit for mas-
sive particles. While an increasing mass of bosons
enhances the moment of inertia K2and the shape
coefficient K4of the rotating gas, this effect van-
ishes in the high-temperature limit.
The results obtained in this paper shed light on the
implications of the effects of imaginary rotation obtained
in the context of first-principle lattice simulations and
constitute the basis for the analysis of more complicated
systems, e.g., free fermions or the chiral phase transition39
in the effective QCD models such as the Nambu–Jona-
Lasinio model or nonlinear sigma models. Extending the
present analysis to the case of Dirac fermions is a logical
avenue of future research [60].ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
