A paradigm for quantum synchronization is the quantum analog of the Stuart–Landau oscillator,
which corresponds to a van der Pol oscillator in the limit of weak (i.e. vanishingly small) nonlin-
earity. Due to this limitation, the quantum Stuart–Landau oscillator fails to capture interesting
nonlinearity-induced phenomena such as relaxation oscillations. To overcome this deficiency we
propose an alternative model which approximates the Duffing–van der Pol oscillator to finitely large
nonlinearities while remaining numerically tractable. This allows us to uncover interesting phenom-
ena in the deep-quantum strongly-nonlinear regime with no classical analog, such as the persistence
of amplitude death on resonance. We also report nonlinearity-induced position correlations in reac-
tively coupled quantum oscillators. Such coupled oscillations become more and more correlated with
increasing nonlinearity before reaching some maximum. Again, this behavior is absent classically.
We also show how strong nonlinearity can enlarge the synchronization bandwidth in both single
and coupled oscillators. This effect can be harnessed to induce mutual synchronization between two
oscillators initially in amplitude death.
Introduction.— Mathematical modelling has shown us
how the immense variety and beauty of nature can be
governed by nonlinear differential equations [1–4]. Such
equations, owing to their nonlinearity, are difficult to an-
alyze and their application to physical processes has come
to be known as nonlinear science [5, 6].
How nonlinear effects play out in quantum-mechanical
systems is a subject of intense investigation. By far,
chaos has attracted the most attention [7–10]. Nonethe-
less, noise effects, such as stochastic resonance [11–14]
and coherence resonance [12, 15] have also been promi-
nent, while a recent example is Ref. [16]. Another widely
recognized effect is noise-induced transitions [17]. Re-
cent work has extended this effect to quantum mechanics
by using a quantum stochastic differential equation and
its correspondence to nonlinear dissipation [18] (see also
Ref. [19]). There are also promising applications of non-
linear dissipation such as stabilizing bosonic qubits for
fault-tolerant quantum computing [20–22], and enhanc-
ing the sensitivity of quantum sensors [23, 24].
A relative newcomer to the study of nonlinear effects
in quantum systems is synchronization [25]. Its most ele-
mentary form consists of applying a sinusoidal force, say
with amplitude f, and frequency Ω d, to a self-sustained
oscillator. Synchronization is then the modification of
the oscillator frequency to Ω d. A prototypical model is
the driven van der Pol (vdP) oscillator [26], defined by

where primes denote differentiation with respect to the
argument (in this case t, representing time). In the ab-
sence of forcing ( f= 0) the oscillator is characterized
byω0, and a nonlinearity parameter µwhich controls
how much the oscillator is damped towards an ampli-
tude of order |q|. An important feature of the undriven
vdP system is the existence of a supercritical Hopf bifur-
cation at µ= 0, via which a stable limit cycle appears
forµ >0 [26].
Atµ= 0, (1) is entirely linear. This motivates one to
consider the quasilinear limit of (1), defined by µ−→0+.
In this limit the vdP oscillator is well approximated by
the Stuart–Landau (SL) oscillator, the steady state of
which is rotationally symmetric in phase space (a circular
limit cycle). This makes the SL oscillator much simpler
to analyze, and has thus served as a starting point in the
literature on quantum synchronization for continuous-
variable systems, e.g. Refs. [27–42]. The trade-off of
course, is that effects taking place at finite values of µ
are excluded. A well known example of this is relaxation
oscillations in the undriven vdP oscillator1[3, 26, 47].
More effects start to appear if driving is included, such
1In fact, vdP intended for (1) to model relaxation oscillations in
an electrical circuit [43]. To observe relaxation oscillations in
quantum theory one needs to quantize the exact vdP model, and
it is only relatively recently that such efforts have been made [44–
46].arXiv:2301.02948v2  [quant-ph]  21 Jun 20232
as quasiperiodicity and chaos [48–50], both of which are
absent in the driven SL oscillator.
In this work, we investigate the effects of nonlinear-
ity in quantum oscillators by considering a more general
model based on the classical Duffing–van der Pol (DvdP)
oscillator. This adds ζ x3toy′where ζis another nonlin-
earity parameter. To overcome the inadequacy of the SL
model we propose a quantum DvdP oscillator in which
the vdP and Duffing nonlinearities (respectively µand
ζ) are nonvanishing, but also not arbitrarily large. Our
model is accurate up to order ( µ/ω 0)2, at which the dis-
tinct signatures of strong nonlinearity appear, such as
relaxation oscillations [45]. Our approach has the bene-
fit of capturing novel nonlinear effects while evading the
large computational cost of simulating quantum systems
with very strong nonlinear dissipations.
We show that for a single oscillator with periodic forc-
ing there exists a critical Duffing nonlinearity, above
which further increases in ζenlarges the synchroniza-
tion bandwidth (the amount of detuning the forcing can
tolerate from the oscillator and still entrain it). This re-
sult is similar to the synchronization enhancement from
the classical literature [51], but now generalized to quan-
tum oscillators.2In contrast, the vdP nonlinearity ac-
tivates genuine quantum effects. Coupling two vdP os-
cillators dissipatively may lead to either amplitude death
(the cessation of oscillations), or mutual synchronization.
Classically, amplitude death occurs only when the two
oscillators are sufficiently detuned [53]. Interestingly, we
find this need not be the case for quantum oscillators.
We show that two quantum vdP oscillators possessing
relatively small limit cycles and nonvanishing nonlinear-
ities can exhibit amplitude death even with zero detun-
ing. Larger limit cycles on the other hand can mutually
synchronize from a state of amplitude death if their non-
linearity is increased.
We also consider reactively coupled oscillators. Two
such SL oscillators cannot develop positional correla-
tions, and hence do not synchronize. This is true regard-
less of whether the oscillators are classical or quantum.
We show here that at finitely large nonlinearity, posi-
tion correlations behave rather differently between the
classical and quantum oscillators: Two reactively cou-
pled quantum vdP oscillators can undergo nonlinearity-
induced correlations whereby their position correlation
increases as they become more nonlinear. In contrast, we
find that making the analogous classical oscillators more
nonlinear monotonically reduces their position correla-
tion. The nonlinearity-induced correlations in the quan-
tum vdP oscillators are thus a consequence of both their
quantum nature and strong nonlinearity.
Model.— For simplicity we consider here a dimension-
2It is also worth mentioning that nonlinear oscillators are of inter-
est to quantum information too, when they are coupled to qubits.
In this context the Duffing nonlinearity has been shown to both
increase and stabilize the oscillator-qubit entanglement [52].less DvdP model in terms of the nonlinearity parameters

and we have also included a dimensionless external force

the approximate analysis of (2), the leading contribution

This motivates a Bogoliubov–Krylov time-average of the

shifts due to λandβ. Additionally, note the first-order
averaging in λforβ= 0 yields the SL equation. Our
approximate model captures the effects of strong vdP
nonlinearity of order λ2. We seek a quantum master
equation ρ′=Lρsuch that ⟨ˆa⟩′= Tr[ˆ aLρ] (with [ˆ a,ˆa†] =
ˆ1) agrees with (3) in the mean-field limit [45]. It can then

found in the Appendix. We remark that both the higher-
order Kerr terms and the nonlinear two-photon dissipa-
tion in our proposed model can be implemented in circuit
QED [21, 58]. The tunability of the limit cycle radius r
allows us to access different parameter regimes of the
quantum oscillator, in particular the quantum ( r≪1),
and semiclassical ( r≈1) regimes. We have included
the second-order contributions in λin our model for its
nonlinearity-tuning capability, since the terms linear in λ
neither affect the limit-cycle amplitude nor phase dynam-
ics. The Duffing nonlinearity translates to a Kerr term
inL. This model can be considered as an alternative to
the quantum SL oscillator, but with flexibility in tuning
the nonlinearity. All our numerical results for a given
parameter set are obtained with a sufficiently large trun-
cation of the Hilbert space by ensuring the corresponding
steady-state power spectrum converge.3
Nonlinearity-enhanced synchronization.— We study
first the frequency locking of the approximate quantum
DvdP oscillator to a periodic force [(4) and (5)]. The syn-
chronization bandwidth is the range of ωdfor which the
oscillator frequency is locked to the driving frequency at
steady state. This is achieved when |ωd−˜ω|= 0, where ˜ ω
the observed frequency of the driven oscillator, obtained
from the peak of its spectrum averaged over one period
of the drive [45].
Here we find the Duffing nonlinearity to enhance quan-
tum synchronization: For a range of λand a fixed r,
increasing βpast a critical value widens the synchroniza-
tion bandwidth linearly. This is illustrated in Fig. 1(a)
where the synchronization bandwidth is plotted as a con-
tour against ¯β≡βr2andF/r. The critical value of ¯βis
indicated by the red dashed line, where the bandwidth
is equal to its corresponding value at ¯β= 0. However,
this enhancement does not occur for all values of the
vdP nonlinearity. In Fig. 1(b) we see that an increase
of¯λ≡λr2from its value in Fig. 1(a) can ruin the gain
in synchronization bandwidth due to ¯β. Noting that the
dissipative terms in Lare all proportional to λ, this effect
can be qualitatively attributed to the phase diffusion due
to quantum noise, which is known to inhibit synchroniza-
tion [27, 28, 31]. We can develop some understanding of
the quantum DvdP by examining its classical analog. Us-
ing the method of harmonic balance on x, we are able to
derive the conditions for nonlinearity-enhanced synchro-
nization analytically for the classical DvdP oscillator (see
derivation in Appendix), given by
¯β >¯λ2
3(1−¯λ2),0<¯λ <1. (6)
This shows clearly the existence of a critical value of ¯β,
and a finite interval of ¯λover which the synchronization
enhancement occurs. These results are consistent with
Fig. 1 except for the fact that quantum noise makes the
range of λfor synchronization enhancement in the quan-
tum DvdP oscillator smaller compared to the classical
range as seen in Fig. 1(b).
We have also shown in Appendix that increasing the
vdP nonlinearity in the quantum model can only reduce
the synchronization bandwidth. One can thus be certain
that the synchronization enhancement seen in our model
is induced by the Duffing nonlinearity. We shall see next
that the vdP nonlinearity can induce synchronization in
coupled oscillators from a state of amplitude death.

their coupling strength by η.
In this case, frequency locking occurs when the ob-
served frequencies of the two oscillators become identical
at steady state. As before, the observed frequency of os-

is maximized, and where the two-oscillator steady state
is to be used. For a fixed η, we define the synchronization
bandwidth to be the range of ∆ for which the two oscil-
lators lock frequencies. It will also be interesting to look
at position correlations in the two oscillators at steady
state, defined by
Σ =⟨ˆx1ˆx2⟩ − ⟨ˆx1⟩⟨ˆx2⟩q

k. Note that frequency locking implies
a nonzero Σ, but not vice versa.
In addition to frequency locking, dissipatively coupled
oscillators can also cease to oscillate. If the oscillators
are classical, then this may happen for a range of ηpro-
vided that ∆ is sufficiently large. And if both oscillators
stabilize to the same phase-space point, which may be
taken to be the origin without loss of generality, then
the effect is termed amplitude death [53, 59]. To define
amplitude death in quantum oscillators we generalize the
notion of P-bifurcations from classical stochastic systems
to the steady-state Wigner function of a reduced state
(see Ref. [18] and other references therein). In this case,
amplitude death is said to occur if the single-oscillator
Wigner functions peak at the origin in quantum phase
space. This approach is consistent with previous stud-
ies on amplitude death in coupled quantum oscillators4
[36–39].

tal axis which we also indicate in subplot (c). (a) Large r

correspond to any identifiable effect and is demarcated us-

by a dash-dotted line. As ris increased, the classical bound-
ary is recovered. (b) Effect of varying λon synchronization
forr= 1. Boundaries of the frequency-locking region and
its corresponding λare shown (i.e. the frequency-locking re-
gion is the area underneath each curve). Increasing λcan
enlarge the synchronization bandwidth and induce frequency
locking from a state of amplitude death. (c) Small r(deep
quantum regime). At small r, amplitude death occurs even
at zero initial detuning, which is a quantum effect. Note that
¯λin (a) and (c) are approximately equal, leaving the dif-
ferences between the two plots only as a result of quantum
effects. (d) Shifts in amplitude-death boundary as ¯λis in-
creased (quantum-to-semiclassical transition).
In Fig. 2 we work out regions of frequency locking and
amplitude death in the ( η,∆) parameter space for (7),
along with Σ, shown as a contour in Fig. 2(a) and (c).
Two especially interesting scenarios are—when the limit
cycles are relatively large compared to quantum noise
[Fig. 2(a)]; and when they become small, being more sus-
ceptible to quantum noise [Fig. 2(c)].
In Fig. 2(a) we have indicated the boundary between
frequency locking and amplitude death by a dash-dotted
line, while no identifiable phenomenon occurs to the left
of the solid line. Note the dash-dotted line is a Hopf-
bifurcation curve because the transition from amplitude
death to frequency locking is facilitated by a Hopf bifur-
cation. Clearly, Σ is larger inside the frequency-locking
region. Especially significant here is the effect of the
vdP nonlinearity on synchronization. Whereas in the
single-oscillator case the vdP nonlinearity had only detri-

Positional correlation (8) for two reactively coupled

mental effects, it now has a constructive role by enlarg-
ing the (mutual) synchronization bandwidth. We illus-
trate this in Fig. 2(b) where additional frequency-locking
boundaries for different values of vdP nonlinearity λare
plotted. It can be seen that increasing λenlarges the
frequency-locking region (see also Appendix for some
classical analysis). This means that two oscillators in
a state of amplitude death with an ( η,∆) lying above
the Hopf-bifurcation curve in Fig. 2(a) will transit sud-
denly to a state of synchronized oscillations when λis
sufficiently increased. This may be appropriately called
nonlinearity-induced mutual synchronization.
Turning now to the case of a small limit cycle ( r≪1)
in Fig. 2(c), we find frequency locking to be absent while
position correlations become negligible. The blue solid
line delineates the boundary of amplitude death. Most
striking is the persistence of amplitude death at zero de-
tuning (i.e. ∆ = 0). Classically, some frequency mis-
match between the two oscillators must be present in
order for amplitude death to occur [53]. This signifies
a clear distinction between classical and quantum dy-
namics. A loss of amplitude death at ∆ = 0 may then
be expected if we increased either rorλ(while hold-
ing the other constant). This is indeed what we find,
as illustrated in Fig. 2(d), where such a quantum-to-
semiclassical transition is captured by increasing ¯λ≡
λr2.
Since we have focused exclusively on the vdP nonlin-
earity here, we note that incorporating a Duffing non-
linearity into our model will not in fact change the
frequency-locking boundary. We can understand this
from the classical coupled equations of motion, where
we see that βappears only in the phase dynamics of the
oscillators, and that such terms vanish at steady state for
identical oscillators (equal limit cycle radii) [60].
Nonlinearity-induced correlations.— It is known that
two reactively coupled SL oscillators cannot synchronize
nor share position correlations. This is true even in the
quantum case (see Appendix). However, we show here
that positional correlations between two reactively cou-
pled quantum vdP oscillators do develop. Here we must
use the exact vdP Lindbladian [45], because under reac-5
tive coupling, the approximate model does not produce
any off-diagonal elements in the steady state, and hence
cannot generate correlations in the two oscillators. As
with the dissipatively coupled system, two reactively cou-
pled vdP oscillators can be modelled by considering two
uncoupled vdP oscillators with annihilation operators ˆ a1
and ˆa2, coupled by the Hamiltonian g(ˆa1ˆa†
2+ˆa†
1ˆa2), where
gis the reactive coupling strength. As before, we assume
that both oscillators have the same nonlinearity λ.
In Fig. 3(a), we generate a contour plot of Σ as a func-
tion of λandgatr= 0.3 and ∆ = 0 .05. From this we
see that for a fixed g, increasing the oscillator nonlinear-
ity beyond the SL regime leads to stronger correlations.
We illustrate this more clearly in Fig. 3(b) by showing
how Σ varies as a function of λforg= 0.2, 0.4, and
0.8, which are marked in Fig. 3(a) by vertical dashed
lines. Note this also shows the existence of an optimal
λwhich maximizes Σ. Such nonlinearity-induced corre-
lations are absent in the corresponding classical model.
At a given coupling strength, the position correlation in
two reactively coupled classical vdP oscillators decreases
monotonically as λincreases (see Appendix).
Conclusion.— Our work goes beyond the well-studied
paradigm of weak nonlinearity in quantum synchroniza-
tion, and provides the first systematic study of quan-
tum synchronization effects for strong nonlinearity. We
introduced a new quantum oscillator model which cap-
tures intriguing effects induced by two strong nonlineari-
ties. We showed that a strong Duffing nonlinearity leads
to a linear enhancement of the synchronization band-
width in driven oscillators. We also reported genuine
quantum synchronization effects exclusive to strong non-
linearity which are not observed previously: Increasing
the vdP nonlinearity enhances the synchronization band-
width, and revives synchronization between dissipatively-
coupled oscillators in amplitude death. For reactively-
coupled vdP oscillators on the other hand, we find that
strong nonlinearity induces position correlations which
are impossible in the weakly-nonlinear limit. Our model
provides a new paradigm for studying other strongly non-
linear effects such as chaos [7, 26, 61, 62].

Here, we describe how the quantum master equation
for the exact Duffing-van der Pol model is obtained, fol-
lowing the approach in [45]. Starting from the classical
equation (2) in the main text, and defining the complex
amplitude α= (˜x+i˜y)/2, we get the equation of motion

2cos(ωdt)−i α−iβ
2(α+α∗)3

2(α3+|α|2α− |α|2α∗−α∗3−r2α+r2α∗).(A1)
Quantum theory defines the state of a dynamical sys-
tem by a density operator ρsatisfying ρ′=Lρ, where
Lis a linear superoperator. By regarding (ˆ a,ˆa†) as the
analog of ( α, α∗), where [ˆ a,ˆa†] =ˆ1, we can quantize a
system prescribed by α′=h(α, α∗) by searching for an
Lsuch that in the Schr¨ odinger picture, ⟨ˆa⟩′= Tr[ˆ aLρ] =
⟨:h(ˆa,ˆa†):⟩. Note that we have chosen to normally order
h(ˆa,ˆa†), denoted by colons [e.g. if h(ˆa,ˆa†) = ˆaˆa†, then
:h(ˆa,ˆa†) : = ˆa†ˆa]. Such an Lcorresponding to (A1) can
be found in Lindblad form [55–57], and which we refer to
as a Lindbladian:
L=−i[ˆH,·] +λD[ˆa†ˆa−ˆa†2/2] +λr2D[ˆa†] +3λ

We remark that the choice of the master equation is not
unique, since we only demand that the classical equation
of motion is recovered in the mean-field limit. Differ-
ent choices of the master equation will in general lead
to different quantum noise effects, which are most pro-
nounced at low excitations (sometimes referred to as the
deep quantum limit [30]).

1. Poincar´ e–Lindstedt method
The Poincar´ e–Lindstedt method is a perturbative tech-
nique to find approximate periodic solutions [26]. Reg-
ular perturbation theory fails at long time due to the
existence secular terms. Taking λto be the perturbative
parameter, such secular terms in the van der Pol (vdP)
oscillator are of the form tcost, which are unbounded in
t. The Poincar´ e–Lindstedt method overcomes this prob-
lem by removing secular terms explicitly.6
Let us consider the undriven vdP oscillator (setting
F= 0). Defining a rescaled time τ≡ωtwhere ωis the
oscillation frequency, we have the equation
ω2x′′(τ) +λ(x2−1)ω x′(τ) +x(τ) = 0 . (B1)
where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the
argument. Now, we perform the perturbative expansions
x(τ) = ˘x0(τ) +λ˘x1(τ) +λ2˘x2(τ) + O( λ3),(B2)
ω= 1 + λ˘ω1+λ2˘ω2+ O(λ3). (B3)
Collecting terms of the same order in λ, the zeroth-order
equation reads
˘x′′
0+ ˘x0= 0, (B4)
which just describes simple harmonic oscillations given
by ˘x0(τ) = acosτ, where a= ˘x0(0). The first-order
equation reads

(B5)
The resonant forcing gives rise to secular terms such as
τcosτandτsinτwhich are unwanted. Hence, setting
the resonant forcing to zero yields ˘ ω1= 0, a= 2 which
gives ˘ x0(τ) = 2 cos τ,ω= 1 + O( λ2). This is the Stuart–
Landau (SL), i.e. weakly nonlinear limit of the vdP which
describes quasiharmonic oscillations. Solving the result-
ing first-order equation, we get the leading-order correc-
tion for x(τ):x1(τ) = sin3τ. To obtain the leading-order
correction for ω, we look at the second-order equation

Again, eliminating the resonant forcing, we get ˘ ω2=
−1/16. In terms of t, we then have
x(t) = 2 cos( ωt) +λsin3(ωt) + O( λ2), (B7)
ω= 1−λ2
16+ O(λ3). (B8)
Thus, the effect of small nonlinearity on the limit cycle is
a decrease in frequency and a distortion without a change
in the limit cycle amplitude (from the first-order approx-
imation of x(t) we can see that for λ <4/3 the amplitude
of the oscillation is constant at 2. Hence, the amplitude
is unchanged to order λ.) A numerical simulation of x(t)
and observed frequency ωas given by (B8) are plotted
in Fig. 4. Good agreement between the analytic and
numeric simulation can be seen for λ <1.2. Krylov–Bogoliubov averaging
The Krylov–Bogoliubov averaging method essentially
assumes that the amplitude is slowly varying and can be
treated as a constant when averaging the dynamics over
one period, which produced the time-averaged equations
of motion. Introducing the complex amplitude,
α(t) =1
2[x(t) +i y(t) ], (B9)
where y=x′, we can rewrite the vdP equation as a
complex equation of motion
α′=−i α+iF
2cos(ωdt)−λ
2(α3−α∗3+|α|2α−|α|2α∗−α+α∗).
(B10)
Performing the Krylov–Bogoliubov time averaging to
first-order in λ, we obtain
α′=−i α+λ
2(1− |α|2)α , (B11)
which is the well-known SL equation representing the
normal form of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The sta-
ble oscillations are described by α(t) = exp( −it). This
gives x(t) = 2 cos twhich is consistent with the Poincar´ e–
Lindstedt method up to zeroth order in λ.
The second-order averaging yields [54]
α′=−i α+λ
2(1−|α|2)α+iλ2

α ,
(B12)
which predicts a limit cycle amplitude of ˘ x0= 2|α|= 2
and frequency ω= 1−λ2/16, again consistent with the
zeroth-order Poincar´ e–Lindstedt method.
3. Synchronization analysis
Here, we use the harmonic-balance method to analyze
the synchronization behavior for the Duffing–van der Pol
(DvdP) equation in nondimensionalized form, given by
x′′+λ(x2−r2)x′+x+βx3=Fcos(ωdt).(B13)
Note that for ease of writing we have omitted tildes
forxand all dimensionless parameters (e.g. time). We
then assume a synchronized solution of the form x(t) =
Acos(ωdt−ϕ), where Ais the amplitude of the motion
andϕis a constant phase shift from the driving force.
Substituting the ansatz for xinto (B13), we get

This can be solved to obtain the relationship between δA

inδ A. For synchronization to exist, δ Amust be real,
hence the discriminant must be non-negative, i.e.,

Hence, the vdP oscillator is synchronized if the driving
frequency is within the critical interval
ω0−F
λωc≤ωd≤ω0+F

The synchronization bandwidth is thus
2F
λωc=(F/r)
2λr2(1 + 3 βr2)p
(λr2)2(1 + 3 βr2) + 9( βr2)2.
(B24)
Evidently, by fixing F/r,λr2, and βr2, the synchroniza-
tion bandwidth becomes independent of the scale param-
eterr. As shown in the main text, this does not hold true
in the quantum case due to quantum noise. Defining
¯F=F/r , ¯λ=λr2,¯β=βr2, (B25)
the bandwidth can be rewritten as
2¯F
¯λωc=¯F
2¯λ(1 + 3 ¯β)q
¯λ2(1 + 3 ¯β) + 9 ¯β2
≈(¯F/2¯λ , ¯β−→ ∞
¯F/2, ¯β−→0(B26)
where in the last step we have taken the limit of large
and small ¯β. For the usual vdP oscillator ( ¯β= 0), the
synchronization bandwidth reduces to ¯F/2 which is in-
dependent of λ. In order to obtain nonlinearity-induced
enhancement in the bandwidth, we require
¯F
2¯λ(1 + 3 ¯β)q
¯λ2(1 + 3 ¯β) + 9 ¯β2>¯F
2. (B27)
This results in the conditions
¯β >¯λ2
3(1−¯λ2),0<¯λ <1. (B28)8
Without loss of generality, we can set r= 1 in the fol-
lowing discussion. In this case ¯λ=λ,¯β=β, and ¯F=F.
Interestingly, the nonlinearity-induced enhancement only
acts for a finite range of λand requires a minimum β. In
the limit of large β, the bandwidth tends to F/2λ. How-
ever, the method of harmonic balance assumes λandβ
to be weak. In this regime, we can interpret the ex-
istence of a minimum βas a competition between the
effects of λandβ. Note that the oscillator frequency is
ω≈1 + 3 β/2−λ2/16 from our previous analysis. The
threshold for synchronization enhancement occurs when
these two opposite effects on the frequency are of the
same scale, i.e. β∼λ2.
Figure 5 shows the effect of adding the Duffing non-
linearity on the synchronization bandwidth for r= 1.
Comparing β= 0 and β= 1 in Fig. 5(a), we can see that
the synchronization bandwidth is enhanced for the β= 1
case for weak to moderate forcing F(compared to λ).
The analytical prediction of the bandwidth agrees with
the numerical simulations up to F∼λ, beyond which the
numerical bandwidth exceeds the predicted value indicat-
ing the suppression of natural dynamics at strong forcing.
Using λ= 0.5, we also predict that the synchronization
enhancement occurs when β >1/9. Indeed, by plotting
in Fig. 5(b) the enhancement factor, defined as the ratio
between the bandwidth and its baseline value F/2, we
see a good agreement between the numerical results and
the analytical calculations. Fluctuations in the numerics
can be attributed to a few reasons, such as the time res-
olution dtin the simulation, the number of samples used
forx(t), the frequency resolution dωused in determining
the bandwidth, and the threshold observed detuning used
to determine the frequency-locked regions (set to 0.001).
The numerical results also appear to deviate slightly from
the prediction at large β, which is likely due to the break-
down in making the ansatz x(t) =Acos(ωdt−ϕ) used in
the derivation. Including higher harmonics in the ansatz
might result in more accurate predictions at larger β.
Appendix C: Two classical oscillators with
dissipative coupling
The equations of motion for two dissipatively coupled
vdP oscillators are often written as
x′′
1+λ(x2
1−1)x′
1+x1=η
2(x′
2−x′
1),
x′′
2+λ(x2
2−1)x′
2+ (1 + ∆) x2=η
2(x′
1−x′
2),(C1)
where ηis the coupling strength and ∆ is the detun-
ing between the two oscillators. The system has four
phase-space dimensions, two for each oscillator, given
by (x1, y1) = ( x1, x′
1) and ( x2, y2) = ( x2, x′
2). We can
express the coupled system more simply using complex
amplitudes as we did in (B9), except now
αk(t) =1
2[xk(t) +i yk(t) ], k = 1,2. (C2)We will analyze the following first-order averaged equa-
tions for the coupled system assuming the nonlinearity
to be weak,
α′
1=−i α1+λ
2(1− |α1|2)α1+η
2(α2−α1),
α′
2=−i(1 + ∆) α2+λ
2(1− |α2|2)α2+η
2(α1−α2).
(C3)
1. Synchronization analysis
In fact, only three real variables are needed in polar
coordinates. If we write
αk=Rkexp (−iϕk), k = 1,2, (C4)
then we may express the coupled dynamics in terms of
only R1,R2, and the phase difference φ≡ϕ2−ϕ1:
R′
1=λ
2R1(1−R2
1) +η
2(R2cosφ−R1),
R′
2=λ
2R2(1−R2
2) +η
2(R1cosφ−R2),
φ′= ∆−η
2R1
R2+R2
R1
sinφ .(C5)
By symmetry, if the two oscillators synchronize, we must
have R1=R2=R. In this case the above equations
simplify further to
R′=λ
2R(1−R2) +η
2R(cosφ−1),
φ′= ∆−ηsinφ .(C6)
In the synchronized state, R′=φ′= 0. Solving the phase
equation, we get two solutions, φ(1)
⋆= sin−1(∆/η) and
φ(2)
⋆=π−sin−1(∆/η). To determine the stable phase, we
use linear stability analysis. Substituting φ(t) =φ(k)
⋆+
ϵ(t) (k= 1,2) into the phase equation of motion and
keeping only first-order terms in ϵ, we get
ϵ′= ∆−ηsin

⋆+ϵ

From this we see that φ(1)
⋆is stable while φ(2)
⋆is unstable.
We also find that |∆|< ηto be a necessary condition for
synchronization. Substituting φ(1)
⋆into the radial equa-
tionR′= 0 then gives

for weak to moderate forcing (compared to λ). The analytical predictions given by the dashed lines) are accurate up to F∼λ.
(b) Enhancement factor defined as the ratio between the bandwidth and its baseline value F/2. A value greater than one

The zero-amplitude solution corresponds to the case of
amplitude death and will be analyzed next. Perform-
ing linear stability analysis, we find that r⋆is stable
for 0 <|∆| ≤λand|∆|< η, or when, |∆|> λ and
|∆|<p
λ(2η−λ). Combining the phase and amplitude
solutions, the conditions for synchronization is then
|∆|< η , forη≤λ , (C10)
|∆|<p
λ(2η−λ),forη > λ . (C11)
2. Amplitude death
It is possible for coupled oscillators to achieve ampli-
tude death, where the limit cycle oscillations are sup-
pressed due to the mutual coupling. To obtain the
conditions for amplitude death, we require the solution
α1=α2= 0 to be stable. Since the phase is undefined
in this case, we will analyze in Cartesian coordinates in-
stead. Denoting αk=ℜ[ϵk] +iℑ[ϵk] (k= 1,2) for small
ϵk, we can linearize the coupled equations around the
origin, giving,

ℜ[ϵ1]
ℑ[ϵ1]
ℜ[ϵ2]
ℑ[ϵ2]
′
=

(λ−η)/2 ω1 η/2 0

0 η/2 −ω2 (λ−η)/2

ℜ[ϵ1]
ℑ[ϵ1]
ℜ[ϵ2]
ℑ[ϵ2]
,
(C12)where ω1= 1 and ω2= 1+∆. Let hbe the eigenvalues
of the stability matrix in (C12), and p=h−(λ−η)/2.
The characteristic polynomial for hthen reads

(C13)
The eigenvalues hare therefore
h=1
2h
λ−η±p
η2−∆2i
±i(ω1+ω2)
2.(C14)
Forα1=α2= 0 to be stable, the real part of hmust be
negative. This gives us the the following necessary and
sufficient condition for amplitude death
η > λ , |∆|>p
λ(2η−λ). (C15)
The curve |∆|=p
λ(2η−λ) thus separates the regions
of synchronization and amplitude death, also known as
the Hopf bifurcation curve.
3. Effect of the Duffing nonlinearity
Recall from (B13) that a Duffing–van der Pol (DvdP)
oscillator has a nonlinear frequency term βx3in its
second-order equation of motion for x. If we were to
define the DvdP by its equation of motion for its com-
plex amplitude α, then this term amounts to adding
−i3β|α|2αtoα′under first-order time averaging with
respect to the Duffing nonlinearity. We show here that
such a modification due to the Duffing nonlinearity in two
dissipatively coupled DvdP oscillators does not change
their mutual synchronization from the β= 0 case.10
The classical time-averaged equations of motion for two
dissipatively-coupled DvdP oscillators are

where ω1= 1 and ω2= 1 + ∆. Note these equations
assume second-order time averaging with respect to the
vdP nonlinearity [see (B12)]. As in the case of β= 0 in
Sec. C 1, mutual synchronization is more easily analyzed
using polar coordinates, where αk=Rkexp(−iϕk) (k=
1,2). Equations (C16) and (C17) are then equivalent to

sinφ .(C18)
Recall from Sec. C 1 that we have defined φ≡ϕ2−ϕ1. By
symmetry, when the two oscillators synchronize, we have
R1=R2. Consequently, the equation of motion for the
phase difference φbecomes independent of R1andR2.
Moreover, the βterm vanishes, which suggests that the β
nonlinearity has no effect on the mutual synchronization.
4. Synchronization bandwidth
For a fixed η, we define from Eq. (C11) the synchro-
nization bandwidth to be the range of initial detunings
∆ for which the two oscillators synchronize. This is given
by the piecewise function
Bandwidth =(
2p
λ(2η−λ)λ≤η
2η λ > η(C19)
where the factor of 2 arises because ∆ can be either
positive or negative (or zero). Increasing λfrom 0, we
find that the bandwidth increases monotonically until
λ=η, after which the bandwidth saturates at 2 η. Thus,
the vdP nonlinearity enlarges the synchronization band-
width. This is shown by the synchronization boundaries

FIG. 7. Synchronization boundaries of two coupled quantum
DvdP oscillators for different values of λ. Comparing with
Fig.2b in the main text, we see that the additional Kerr non-
linearity β= 0.2 does not change the synchronization bound-
ary.
in Fig. 6 for various values of λ, where synchronization
regions lie below the boundary curves. Fixing ηand in-
creasing the nonlinearity parameter λleads to a larger
synchronization bandwidth. This also implies that fix-
ing ∆ and ηwhile increasing λcan lead to nonlinearity-
induced mutual synchronization whereby the two oscil-
lators transition suddenly from amplitude death to syn-
chronized oscillations.
As a measure for synchronization enhancement, we can
calculate the ‘total bandwidth’ by integrating the syn-
chronization bandwidth from η= 0 to some η=ηmax,
which can then be evaluated asymptotically for large11
ηmax(compared to λ). This gives (assuming ηmax> λ)

which increases as λ1/2. Since Bhas the geometrical
interpretation of the area covered by the synchronization
region in the parameter space ( λ, η), this means that the
synchronization region grows with the vdP nonlinearity
λ.
Appendix D: Two classical oscillators with reactive
coupling
Let us first consider two classical SL oscillators which
are reactively coupled with strength g. The coupled
complex-amplitude equations are
α′
1=−i α1+λ
2(1− |α1|2)α1+i g(α2−α1),
α′
2=−i(1 + ∆) α2+λ
2(1− |α2|2)α2+i g(α1−α2).
(D1)
Similar to before, we work in polar coordinates, giving
R′
1=λ
2R1(1−R2
1) +g R2sinφ ,
R′
2=λ
2R2(1−R2
2)−g R1sinφ ,
φ′= ∆ + gR2
R1−R1
R2
cosφ .(D2)
At steady state, R1=R2, and we see that φ′= ∆.
In other words, the rate at which the phase difference
grows is exactly the detuning between the two oscilla-
tors. Thus for reactive coupling, the two oscillators sim-
ply cannot synchronize. This result generalizes to the
case two quantum SL oscillators.
What is particularly interesting in the case of reac-
tive coupling is how the oscillators behave beyond the
λ−→0+limit. In the main text we have shown that in-
creasing the nonlinearity in two reactively coupled quan-
tum vdP oscillators increases their position correlation
before a plateau is reached. This result is particularly
interesting because the analogous classical system fails
to produce the same effect. Here we show this explicitly
by computing the steady-state correlation coefficient for
the positions of two classical vdP oscillators as a func-
tion of their nonlinearities (assumed identical, given by
λ) and their coupling strength. The position correlation

are interested in how x1(t) and x2(t) are correlated in

out. We have also defined

where we have in-
troduced a small time increment δt. For a sufficiently
large sample size M, (D3) measures how correlated x1(t)
andx2(t) are in the long-time limit (or steady state).
The result of such a computation is shown in Fig. 8 as a
function of λandg. Asλ−→0, we can see that the cor-
relation vanishes, as expected from the SL model. But
more importantly, and omitting the degenerate λ= 0
case, we find that Σ appears to decrease monotonically
with λ, and decreases sharply to zero when λexceeds
some critical value. It is simply impossible to increase Σ
by increasing λfor two reactively-coupled classical vdP
oscillators at a fixed g. This is in stark contrast to the
same calculation performed for two such quantum vdP
oscillators for which Σ can increase if λis increased for
a given g.12
Appendix E: Quantum synchronization in the deep
quantum limit
1. Dissipatively-coupled oscillators
We derive here a sufficient condition for amplitude
death in two dissipatively coupled SL oscillators in the
deep quantum regime. The density operator for two
dissipatively-coupled oscillators satisfies ρ′=Lρwhere

where ∆ is the detuning between the two oscillators and
ηis the dissipative coupling strength. Note that we have
assumed equal single-photon amplification rates κ, and
equal two-photon dissipation rates γfor the two oscilla-
tors. In the deep quantum limit, i.e. when γ/κ−→ ∞ ,
the process of two-photon loss dominates and this con-
fines each oscillator to the zero- and one-photon sub-
space. This allows us to treat each oscillator effectively
as a two-level system. After adiabatically eliminating the
higher excited states [31]) we have

where ¯∆≡∆/κand ¯η≡η/κ. We have also denoted
the creation and annihilation operators for the jth os-
cillator in the {|0⟩,|1⟩}subspace by ˆ σ+
jand ˆσ−
j. With
this simplification, we can solve for the steady-state den-
sity matrix exactly, defined by ¯Lϱ= 0. In the basis
{|00⟩,|01⟩,|10⟩,|11⟩}we find

Σ−→1/4 is achieved in the limit ¯∆−→0 and ¯ η−→

oscillator, giving the single-oscillator density matrix

. (E7)
Its Wigner distribution, taken as a function of the radial
coordinate r, can then be calculated explicitly as
W1(r) = (ϱ11+ϱ22)e−r2+ (ϱ33+ϱ44)(2r2−1)e−r2.
(E8)
We define amplitude death to be the regime where the
Wigner distribution possesses a single peak at the ori-
gin instead of being ring like. A sufficient and necessary
condition for this is when ϱ11+ϱ22≥3/4, or equivalently,
¯∆2≥27−15 ¯η2−4 ¯η3
(¯η−1)(¯η−2). (E9)
Interestingly, when the two oscillators are on resonance
(¯∆ = ∆ = 0), amplitude death can still occur as long
as ¯η≳1.17. This is due to the quantum noise which is
significant in the deep quantum limit, rather than coming
from the frequency mismatch between the oscillators.
2. Reactively-coupled oscillators
We show here that two identical reactively-coupled
quantum SL oscillators cannot share any position cor-
relations. This permits calling the correlations observed
in two similarly coupled vdP oscillators to be nonlinearity
induced. For two reactively-coupled quantum SL oscilla-
tors, its Lindbladian (in units where κ= 1, ∆ = 0)
