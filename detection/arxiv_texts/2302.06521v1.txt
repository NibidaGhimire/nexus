ABSTRACT
The properties of collisionless shocks are frequently asse ssed in the magnetohydrodynamics(MHD) model. Yet, in a coll isionless
plasma, an ambient magnetic ﬁeld can sustain a stable anisot ropy in the upstream or the downstream, resulting in a depart ure
from the MHD predicted behavior. We present a model allowing to derive the downstream anisotropy, hence the shock densit y
jump, in terms of the upstream quantities. For simplicity, t he case of a parallel shock in pair plasma is considered. Cont rary to
previous works where the upstream was assumed isotropic, he re the upstream anisotropy /u1D434=/u1D447⊥//u1D447/bardblis a free parameter. The
strong sonic shock regime is formally identical to the isotr opic upstream case. Yet, for intermediate sonic Mach number s, a
variety of behaviors appear as a result of the anisotropy of t he upstream.
Key words: MHD -– plasmas -– shock waves.
1 INTRODUCTION
Shock waves are fundamental processes which display a sudde n jump
of density, temperature, etc. in the medium where they propa gate. The
amplitude of these jumps can be determined assuming that mat ter,
momentum and energy are conserved before and after the shock wave.
When binary collisions are frequent, these conservation la ws take a
simple form as the pressure upstream and downstream can be co nsid-
ered isotropic. In the absence of such collisions, the possi ble existence
of shock waves was debated up to the early 90s ( Sagdeev & Kennel
1991).
The reason for the debate was that not only collisions isotro pize
ﬂow, but they are also the microscopic agent which mediates t he
very existence of the shockwave. In this respect it was found that
shock waves could exist in the absence of collisions only in a plasma,
where collective electromagnetic eﬀects can substitute co llisions as
an agent mediating the shock ( Sagdeev 1966 ). Such shock waves
have been called “collisionless shocks”. Their very existe nce is now
ﬁrmly established by in situ measurements of the earth bow shock
(Bale et al. 2003 ;Schwartz et al. 2011 ).
Collisionless shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysical envi ronments.
Their ability to accelerate particles ( Blandford & Ostriker 1978 )
makes them good candidates to explain the origin of high en-
ergy cosmic rays, fast radio bursts ( Zhang 2020 ;Sironi et al. 2021 )
or gamma gay bursts ( Piran 2004 ). Because the spectral index
of shock accelerated particles depends on the shock density ratio
(Blandford & Ostriker 1978 ), this quantity is of prime relevance for
the physics of the aforementioned phenomena. As mentioned p revi-
ously, the earth bow shock is another example of collisionle ss shock.
More generally, shock detections in the solar system are rou tine
★E-mail: antoineclaude.bret@uclm.es(David et al. 2022 ), and some instances of anisotropic upstream have
been reported ( Fraschetti & Giacalone 2020 ).
From the theoretical point of view, the absence of collision s re-
quires dealing with collisionless shocks at the kinetic lev el, making
use of the Vlasov equation. Since this equation is notorious ly diﬃ-
cult to address, the properties of collisionless shocks are frequently
deduced from magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), even though MHD,
as the plasma counterpart of ﬂuid dynamics, assumes collisi ons,
hence, isotropy of pressures ( Goedbloed et al. (2010) ch. 2 and 3,
Thorne & Blandford (2017) §13.2).
Therefore, one needs to ask the question: to which extent can pres-
sure be considered isotropic in a collisionless plasma? In t he absence
of external magnetic ﬁeld, the Weibel instability ensures i sotropy,
at least on time scales longer than the inverse growth rate, s ince it
states that an anisotropic collisionless plasma is unstabl e (Weibel
1959;Silva et al. 2021 ). Yet, an external magnetic ﬁeld can stabilize
an anisotropy in a collisionless plasma. This has been beaut ifully
proved by in situ measurements in the solar wind ( Bale et al. 2009 ;
Maruca et al. 2011 ;Schlickeiser et al. 2011 ). The instabilities limit-
ing the anisotropy are the ﬁrehose and the mirror instabilit y (Gary
1993). While in the limit of zero external ﬁeld they impose isotro py,
they allow for a window of stable anisotropies in the presenc e of a
magnetic ﬁeld.
Note that Fig. 1-top of Bale et al. (2009) shows than even though
the ﬁrehose and mirror thresholds constraint the solar wind measure-
ments, most of them have indeed /u1D447⊥∼/u1D447/bardbl. As stated in the caption
of the ﬁgure, this results “largely from Coulomb collisions ”, which
are eventually not completely absent. In fact, the bottom pl ot of the
same ﬁgure shows that the “collisional age” of such measurem ents
is higher. Within the framework of the present purely collis ionless
study, Coulomb collisions are absent so that the two collisi onless
instability thresholds are the only factors constraining t he anisotropy.
As a consequence, MHD may not be well adapted to the study of

collisionless shock waves in a magnetized environment. Var ious au-
thors worked out the MHD conservation equations for anisotr opic
pressures ( Hudson 1970 ;Erkaev et al. 2000 ;Double et al. 2004 ;
Gerbig & Schlickeiser 2011 ). Yet, the degree of anisotropy in the
upstream and the downstream is a free parameter in these equa tions.
Granted, the upstream anisotropy may well be considered an i nput
parameter on which depends the downstream quantities. Afte r all,
shock waves analysis usually results in an expression of the down-
stream quantities in terms of the upstream ones. But a theory leaving
the downstream anisotropy as a free parameter is incomplete .
Recently, a model was developed allowing to compute the down -
stream anisotropy in terms of the (isotropic) upstream para meters
(Bret & Narayan 2018 ,2019,2022). For simplicity, this model con-
sidered pair plasmas, where the parallel and perpendicular tem-
peratures are the same for both species. In contrast, in an el ec-
tron/ion plasma, species can be heated diﬀerently at the fro nt crossing
(Guo et al. 2017 ,2018), which would require dealing with four dif-
ferent temperatures (two for the electrons and two for the io ns). Note
that preliminary results seem to indicate that the model can be ap-
plied to electrons/ions plasma, provided the electron mass is replaced
by the ion mass in some key parameters ( Shalaby 2022 ).
Since collisionless shocks in space may well have an anisotr opic
upstream ( Vogl et al. 2001 ;Bale et al. 2009 ), the goal of the present
article is to extend the model to the case of an anisotropic up stream.
The system considered is pictured on ﬁgure 1. The upstream and
downstream quantities are labelled with subscripts “1” and “2” re-
spectively. As in Bret & Narayan (2018), the shock is parallel, with
an external ﬁeld parallel to the direction of motion of the sh ock.
Since in a parallel shock, the upstream and downstream ﬁelds are the
same ( Kulsrud 2005 ), the magnetic ﬁeld is labelled /u1D4690. There lies
the interest of this setup to study collisionless eﬀects eﬀe cts: because
in MHD the ﬂuid and the ﬁeld are decoupled for a parallel shock ,
any change to the shock when the ﬁeld changes, is a kinetic eﬀe ct.
For a purely collisionless plasma, the Vlasov equation impo ses
gyrotropy, namely, equality of the temperatures perpendic ular to the
ﬁeld (see Landau & Lifshitz (1981), §53). This is why we only con-
sider two temperature here instead of three. Admittedly, gy rotropy
could be broken, for example, by electric ﬁelds developing d uringthe growth of the instabilities involved in this work. Yet, w e consider
in the sequel the state of the downstream far from the front, a nd long
after the instabilities developed. There and then, the Vlas ov equation
should enforce gyrotropy.
This article is structured as follows: the method implement ed to
solve the problem is explained in section 2. The conservation equa-
tions for anisotropic pressures, and the dimensionless var iables used
here, are presented in section 3. In section 4we express the re-
strictions set on the upstream parameters by the requiremen t that
it be stable. Then from sections 5to7we solve our model for an
anisotropic upstream, before we reach our conclusions in se ction 8.
2 METHOD
The method implemented here is the same than that of
Bret & Narayan (2018). For completeness of the present article, it
is now brieﬂy recalled.
If the journey of the plasma through the shock were completel y
adiabatic, the double adiabatic relations of Chew et al. (1956) would
apply,
/u1D4472/bardbl=/u1D4471/bardbl/parenleftbigg/u1D45B2/u1D4351
/u1D45B1/u1D4352/parenrightbigg2
, (1)
/u1D4472⊥=/u1D4471⊥/u1D4351
/u1D4352.
For a parallel shock where /u1D4351=/u1D4352, they would result in
/u1D4472/bardbl=/u1D4471/bardbl/parenleftbigg/u1D45B2
/u1D45B1/parenrightbigg2
, (2)
/u1D4472⊥=/u1D4471⊥.
Yet the shock crossing is not adiabatic since in a shock, ther e is an
entropy increase from the upstream to the downstream. It was then
hypothesized in Bret & Narayan (2018) that the relations above hold
for the perpendicular temperature, but not for the parallel one. The
reason for this is that the plasma compression when crossing the
front can be pictured as if it were compressed between 2 conve rging
virtual walls parallel to the shock front, that is, perpendi cular to the
motion. As a result of such an anisotropic compression, the p arallel
temperature increases1while the perpendicular one is left unchanged.
Note that these heuristic prescriptions have been fully con ﬁrmed by
PIC simulations in Haggerty et al. (2022).
This scheme allows to deﬁne 2 stages of the kinetic history of the
plasma from the upstream to the downstream.
•“Stage 1” is the state of the plasma right after the front cros sing,
where its perpendicular temperature has been conserved. As shall be
checked in Section 5, this prescription, together with the conservation
equations, allows for a full characterization of Stage 1.
•Depending on its properties, Stage 1 can be stable or unstabl e. If
stable, then it represents the end state of the downstream. I f unstable,
it migrates to “Stage 2”, deﬁned as follow.
– If Stage 1 was mirror unstable then Stage 2 lies on the mirror
instability threshold.
– If Stage 1 was ﬁrehose unstable, then Stage 2 lies on the
ﬁrehose instability threshold.
Again, in both cases, the conservation equations allow for a full
characterization of Stage 2.

The shock front is eventually treated as a discontinuity, wh ich
means we only consider the state of the plasma far downstream , once
it has reached a steady state. This steady state is Stage 1 if i t is stable,
or Stage 2 if Stage 1 is unstable.
3 CONSERVATION EQUATIONS
The conservation equations for anisotropic pressures were derived
inHudson (1970) and studied in Erkaev et al. (2000);Double et al.
(2004);Gerbig & Schlickeiser (2011). For a parallel shock, /u1D45Abeing
the mass of the particles, they take a simple form,
/u1D45B1/u1D4491=/u1D45B2/u1D4492, (3)

where on both sides, the internal energy /u1D448is given by
/u1D448=/u1D443/bardbl+2/u1D443⊥
2/u1D45B. (6)
In Eqs. ( 4,5), the pressure term only involves the parallel pressure
since it is the pressure component pushing the plasma throug h the
front (see for example the discussion in Feynman et al. (1963), §4-3).
The problem is then solved in terms of the dimensionless vari ables,
/u1D45F=/u1D45B2
/u1D45B1,
/u1D434/u1D456=/u1D447⊥/u1D456

The/u1D712/bardbl1parameter is close to the upstream sonic Mach number.
It only misses the adiabatic index /u1D6FE. Yet, it is preferable to leave
this index out of the deﬁnition of any dimensionless number b ecause
our model switches continuously from a system with 3 degrees of
freedom to a system with 1 degree ( Bret 2021 ).
As shall be checked in section 5.1, our model requires /u1D712/bardbl1>√
3
for Stage 1 to have a positive entropy jump.
The/u1D70Eparameter is widely used in PIC simulations of collisionles s
shocks like Haggerty et al. (2022). It is related to the upstream Alfvén
Mach number M/u1D4341through
M/u1D4341=/u1D4491
/u1D450/u1D4341=1√/u1D70E, (8)

4 INSTABILITY RESTRICTIONS ON UPSTREAM
PARAMETERS
The range of upstream parameters is restricted by the requir ement
that the upstream be both ﬁrehose and mirror stable. The ﬁreh oseinstability is triggered for an upstream anisotropy /u1D4341fulﬁlling ( Gary
1993)2
/u1D4341≡/u1D447⊥1

where/u1D458/u1D435is the Boltzmann constant. The mirror instability is trig-
gered for too strong an upstream anisotropy fulﬁlling
/u1D4341>1+1
/u1D6FD/bardbl1. (12)
Since the upstream has to be stable, Eqs. ( 10,12) restrict the up-
stream phase space parameter to consider. In terms of the dim ension-
less parameters ( 7), we ﬁnd
/u1D6FD/bardbl1=2
/u1D70E/u1D7122
/bardbl1, (13)
so that Eqs. ( 10,12) read
1−/u1D70E/u1D7122
/bardbl1
2< /u1D4341<1+/u1D70E/u1D7122
/bardbl1
2. (14)
In MHD, the density jump of a parallel shock does not vary with /u1D70E
Kulsrud (2005). Since the present work eventually aims at studying
the deviations from MHD in collisionless shocks, it is advan tageous
to use/u1D70Eas the main variable and recast criteria ( 14) in terms of it.
The upstream is then stable if /u1D70E > /u1D70E/u1D462/u1D460(subscript “us” for upstream
stable), with

For/u1D4341=1, any/u1D70Eis allowed since the upstream is always stable.
5 ANALYSIS OF STAGE 1, WITH /u1D447⊥2=/u1D447⊥1
As explained in section 2, we assume the plasma arrives in the down-
stream with the same perpendicular temperature as the upstr eam.
This is our Stage 1. It can be characterized by the conservati on equa-
tions Eqs. ( 3-5). Setting /u1D447⊥2=/u1D447⊥1and/u1D443=/u1D45B/u1D458/u1D435/u1D447, they read,
/u1D45B1/u1D4491=/u1D45B2/u1D4492, (16)
/u1D45B1/u1D45A/u1D4492
1+/u1D45B1/u1D458/u1D435/u1D447/bardbl1=/u1D45B2/u1D45A/u1D4492

2.(18)
Eq. (16) can be used to eliminate /u1D4492everywhere. Then /u1D447/bardbl2can be
expressed from Eq. ( 17). Replacing in Eq. ( 18) gives for /u1D45F=/u1D45B2//u1D45B1,
(/u1D45F−1)(/u1D7122
/bardbl1(/u1D45F−2) +3/u1D45F)=0. (19)
The ﬁrst factor yields the trivial solution /u1D45F=1 corresponding to the
absence of any jump. The second factor gives

formally identical to the isotropic case reported in Bret & Narayan
(2018), replacing /u1D7121by/u1D712/bardbl1. Noteworthily, it does not depend on the
upstream anisotropy /u1D4341.
In the strong sonic shock limit /u1D712/bardbl1→ ∞ , Eq. ( 20) gives/u1D45F=2,
consistent with a shock in 1 dimension. This is expected sinc e in
Stage 1 we freeze the perpendicular degrees of freedom, leav ing
only 1 free degree, namely, the parallel one.
The downstream anisotropy /u1D4342in Stage 1 is then given by
/u1D4342=/u1D43414/u1D7122
/bardbl1
/u1D7124
/bardbl1+2/u1D7122
/bardbl1−3. (21)
The stability diagram for the ﬁrehose and mirror instabilit ies is
pictured in ﬁgure 2. According to Eq. ( 21), the vertical location of
Stage 1 in this diagram only relies on the values of the upstre am
parameters /u1D4341and/u1D712/bardbl1. Therefore, these are the parameters which
determines whether Stage 1 can be mirror or ﬁrehose unstable . The
ultimate answer to the stability question eventually relie s on the ﬁeld
strength/u1D70E, but the choice between these 2 instabilities only relies on
/u1D4341and/u1D712/bardbl1. This feature will be key to analyse the end result of our
model is section 7.
5.1 Entropy of Stage 1 - Restriction on /u1D712/bardbl1
As is the case in a ﬂuid, the requirement of a positive entropy jump
at the shock sets a lower limit on /u1D712/bardbl1. InBret & Narayan (2018) we
found it was√
3. We shall now see that this lower limit remains the
same here.
Expression ( 21) for the anisotropy in Stage 1 allows to compute
the entropy jump between the upstream and the downstream in S tage
1.
Following Bret & Narayan (2018), we consider a bi-Maxwellian
of the form
/u1D453(/u1D497)=/u1D45B
/u1D70B3/2√/u1D44E/u1D44Fexp/parenleftBigg

where/u1D44E=2/u1D458/u1D435/u1D447/bardbl//u1D45Aand/u1D44F=2/u1D458/u1D435/u1D447⊥//u1D45A. The entropy density reads
/u1D446=−/u1D458/u1D435/uni222B.dsp
/u1D453ln/u1D453/u1D4513/u1D463=1

After some straightforward algebra, the diﬀerence of entro py perparticle/u1D446//u1D45Bbetween the upstream and the downstream reads
Δ/u1D460≡/u1D4462

, (24)
since/u1D447⊥2=/u1D447⊥1in Stage 1. From the expression ( 21) of/u1D4342we ﬁnd
that the entropy jump is the same as for the /u1D4341=1 case studied
inBret & Narayan (2018). Therefore, as in Bret & Narayan (2018),
Δ/u1D460 <0 for/u1D712/bardbl1<√
3, so that our model is physically meaningful
only for/u1D712/bardbl1>√
3.
Having characterized Stage 1 we turn to its ﬁrehose and mirro r
stability analysis.
5.2 Firehose stability of Stage 1
We now clarify the conditions on /u1D70E,/u1D434 1, /u1D712/bardbl1for ﬁrehose instability
of Stage 1. The /u1D6FD/bardbl2parameter for the downstream is given by
/u1D6FD/bardbl2=/u1D43412/u1D45F
/u1D70E/u1D4342/u1D7122
/bardbl1. (25)
When substituting /u1D45Fand/u1D4342by their expression ( 20) and ( 21), we
ﬁnd
/u1D6FD/bardbl2=1
/u1D70E/u1D7122
/bardbl1−1
/u1D7122
/bardbl1, (26)
identical to the result of Bret & Narayan (2018).
The criteria for ﬁrehose stability reads
/u1D4342>1−1
/u1D6FD/bardbl2, (27)
that is,
/u1D7122
/bardbl1/u1D70E(/u1D7122
/bardbl1+3) +4/u1D4341
/u1D7124
/bardbl1+2/u1D7122
/bardbl1−3>1. (28)
This equation yields the critical /u1D70E≡/u1D70E/u1D450/u1D453below which Stage 1 is
ﬁrehose unstable,
/u1D70E/u1D450/u1D453=1−4/u1D4341
/u1D7122
/bardbl1+3−1
/u1D7122
/bardbl1. (29)
5.3 Mirror stability of Stage 1
The criteria for mirror stability reads
/u1D4342<1+1
/u1D6FD/bardbl2, (30)
that is,
/u1D7122
/bardbl1/u1D70E(/u1D7122
/bardbl1+3) −4/u1D4341
/u1D7124
/bardbl1+2/u1D7122
/bardbl1−3<−1. (31)
This equation allows to deﬁne a critical /u1D70E≡/u1D70E/u1D450/u1D45Aunder which Stage
1 is mirror unstable,
/u1D70E/u1D450/u1D45A=4/u1D4341
/u1D7122
/bardbl1+3+1
/u1D7122
/bardbl1−1=−/u1D70E/u1D450/u1D453. (32)

5.4 Condition for the need of Stage 2
In the present model, if Stage 1 is unstable, the downstream s witches
from Stage 1 to Stage 2.
If Stage 1 is ﬁrehose unstable, that is, /u1D4342<1−/u1D6FD−1
/bardbl2, Stage 1 will
switch to Stage 2 on the ﬁrehose threshold if /u1D70E < /u1D70E/u1D450/u1D453.
If Stage 1 is mirror unstable, that is, /u1D4342>1+/u1D6FD−1
/bardbl2, Stage 1 will
switch to Stage 2 on the mirror threshold if /u1D70E < /u1D70E/u1D450/u1D45A.
In addition, the /u1D70E-range is limited by the requirement of a stable
upstream, as explained in section 4.
All of these constraints are summarized in ﬁgure 3. For Stage 2
to play any role, such a picture obviously requires that the m inimum
ﬁeld stabilizing the upstream be smaller than /u1D70E/u1D450/u1D453or/u1D70E/u1D450/u1D45A.
For/u1D4341<1,/u1D70E/u1D450/u1D453is relevant and it is easily proved that /u1D70E/u1D462/u1D460< /u1D70E/u1D450/u1D453
is always true.
Yet, for/u1D4341>1,/u1D70E/u1D450/u1D45Ais relevant and /u1D70E/u1D462/u1D460< /u1D70E/u1D450/u1D45Ais not always
fulﬁlled. Figure 4pictures the diﬀerence /u1D70E/u1D450/u1D45A−/u1D70E/u1D462/u1D460in terms of
(/u1D712/bardbl1, /u1D4341). The diﬀerence is found positive only for /u1D4341>1
2(/u1D7122
/bardbl1+3).
As a consequence, for such values of the upstream anisotropy /u1D4341,
there is no need for Stage 2. An example of such a case will be gi ven
in section 7.
6 ANALYSIS OF STAGE 2
According to the premises of our model, the downstream switc hes
to Stage 2 in case Stage 1 is unstable. From the expression ( 21)of the downstream anisotropy in Stage 1, it is easily proved t hat
/u1D4341<1⇒/u1D4342<1. Hence, if /u1D4341<1, Stage 1 can only be ﬁrehose
unstable. On the contrary, if /u1D4341>1, then Stage 1 can only be mirror
unstable. We need therefore to study both options, namely, “ Stage
2 ﬁrehose”, where the downstream lies on the ﬁrehose instabi lity
threshold, and “Stage 2 mirror”, where it lies in the mirror i nstability
threshold.
6.1 Stage 2 ﬁrehose
Imposing Stage 2 to lie on the ﬁrehose instability threshold means
imposing /u1D4342=1−1//u1D6FD/bardbl2in the conservation equations ( 3-5). From
/u1D4482=/u1D443/bardbl2+2/u1D443⊥2

. (35)
Substituting /u1D4482by the expression above in Eq. ( 5) and solving the
system for the density ratio gives a 2nd order polynomial for the
density ratio /u1D45F,
/u1D45F[(2/u1D4341+3)/u1D45F−5] +/u1D7122
/bardbl1[/u1D45F(/u1D45F+/u1D70E−5) +4]=0. (36)
The anisotropy is given by

The polynomial equation ( 36) gives 2 solutions. Yet, one of them
yields a nonphysical, namely negative, value for the anisot ropy/u1D4342.
The physical density jump that has /u1D4342>0 reads

6.2 Stage 2 mirror
Imposing Stage 2 to lie on the mirror instability threshold m eans
imposing /u1D4342=1+1//u1D6FD/bardbl2in the conservation equations ( 3-5). Fol-
lowing the same path than for Stage 2 ﬁrehose also gives a 2nd o rder
polynomial for the density ratio /u1D45F,
/u1D7122
/bardbl1[(/u1D45F(5−/u1D45F+/u1D70E) −4)] +/u1D45F[5− (2/u1D4341+3)/u1D45F]=0, (40)

6.3 Some comments on Stage 2
To which extent can we consider that if Stage 1 is unstable, th en Stage
2 remains on the marginal stability threshold, without migr ating fur-
ther into the stability region? As previously stated, Bale et al. (2009)
concluded that weak Coulomb collisionality is responsible for the
concentration of solar wind measurements around /u1D447⊥=/u1D447/bardbl. Possibly
collisionless relaxation ( Kadomtsev & Pogutse 1970 ;Lapenta et al.
2009;Gedalin 2015 ) could also play a role on longer time scales,
which goes beyond the scope of the present work. For the case o f
an isotropic upstream, the numerical study of Haggerty et al. (2022)
found that Stage 2, when triggered by Stage 1 instability, fu lﬁls the
marginal stability condition.
While the key assumption for Stage 1 is that the perpendicula r
temperature is conserved, no such assumption is made on any t em-
perature for Stage 2. There, the only constraint on the downs tream
is to lie on the ﬁrehose or mirror stability threshold. For th e case
of an isotropic upstream, both temperatures have been expli citly and
separately studied in Bret(2021), showing how in Stage 2, both of
them are eventually a function of /u1D70E.
The density jump for Stage 2 is derived from Eqs. ( 3-5). These
equations consider the ﬁeld is homogenous and aligned with t he ﬂow,
which is why it does not appear in these expressions. Clearly , during
the growth of the mirror or the ﬁrehose instability, the tota l ﬁeld does
not have to be homogenous nor aligned with the ﬂow. Yet, as sta ted
in the introduction and at the end of Section 2, we consider the state
of the downstream long after the instabilities developed, o nce it has
reached a steady state. At this stage, the downstream has rea ched
marginally stability and the macroscopic magnetic ﬁeld is b ack in
line with the ﬂow. Indeed, the simulations of Haggerty et al. (2022)
show that marginal stability is reached within a few /u1D450//u1D714/u1D45D’s behind
the front3.

7 PUTTING STAGES 1 AND 2 TOGETHER
Having computed all the density jumps for Stage 1 and Stage 2 w e
can now provided a full picture of the shock density jump in te rms
of/u1D70E,/u1D434 1, /u1D712/bardbl1.
Figure 5pictures the various cases oﬀered by the model in terms of
(/u1D4341, /u1D712/bardbl1). In the upper part, /u1D4342>1 and the jump is given by Stage
1 or Stage 2 mirror. In the intermediate shaded region, the ju mp can
only be given by Stage 1 since /u1D70E/u1D450/u1D45A> /u1D70E/u1D462/u1D460. In the lower part, /u1D4342<1,
the jump is given by Stage 1 or Stage 2 ﬁrehose.
Figure 6presents plots /u1D45F(/u1D70E)for the values of /u1D712/bardbl1and/u1D4341marked
by the red crosses on ﬁgure 5.
MNRAS 000,1–8(2023)Density jump of collisionless shocks with anisotropic upst ream 7
Panel (a) shows cases pertaining to the upper part of ﬁgure 5, with
/u1D4342>1. The curves only start for values of /u1D70Ecorresponding to a
stable upstream. From Eq. ( 15), this value can be quite high for large
anisotropies. The curves present a segment where the jump is the
one for Stage 2 mirror [Eq. ( 42)], since the ﬁeld is still too weak to
stabilize Stage 1. Then the ﬂat part at large /u1D70Eis the jump of Stage
1 [Eq. ( 20)]. The jump in the Stage 2 mirror phase is an increasing
function of /u1D70E. The strong shock case /u1D712/bardbl1→ ∞ cannot be explored
in this regime because, as visible in ﬁgure 5, this limit always ends
up leaving this region of the phase space4.
Panel (b) shows cases pertaining to the shaded part of ﬁgure 5,
where the ﬁeld required to stabilize the upstream is larger t han the
minimum ﬁeld required to mirror stabilize the downstream wi th/u1D4342>
1. The jump is therefore uniquely given by Stage 1 for all rele vant
/u1D70E/acute.ts1s. The requirement of a stable upstream still sets a minimum v alue
of/u1D70Ebelow which a solution would be un-physical.
Finally, panel (c) shows cases pertaining to the lower part o f ﬁgure
5, with/u1D4342<1. Here, if unstable, Stage 1 is ﬁrehose unstable. In this
regime, studying the strong shock limit /u1D712/bardbl1→ ∞ is meaningful since
it can be reached without leaving this region. In this respec t,/u1D45F(/u1D70E)
has been plotted for /u1D712/bardbl1=100 (not shown by a red cross on ﬁgure
5). As evidenced by looking at Eqs. ( 38,39), this limit for Stage 2
ﬁrehose cannot depend on /u1D4341. In addition, the jump for Stage 1 does
not depend on /u1D4341either (see Eq. 20). As a result, the strong shock
limit is independent of the upstream anisotropy /u1D4341. It is eventually
identical to the strong shock result for the isotropic upstr eam case
described in Bret & Narayan (2018).
8 CONCLUSION
Since MHD is frequently used to assess the properties of coll ision-
less shocks, it is important to study to which extent this str ategy is
pertinent ( Bret 2020 ). In this respect, parallel shocks are of particular
interest since within the MHD framework, the ﬂuid and the ﬁel d are
decoupled Kulsrud (2005). As a consequence, the density jump of a
parallel shock in MHD does not depend on the ﬁeld strength.
In a previous work ( Bret & Narayan 2018 ), it was found that due
to kinetic eﬀects, the density jump of parallel collisionle ss shocks
can deﬁnitely vary with the ﬁeld strength. For strong enough a ﬁeld,
the density jump can go down to 2, instead of 4, the value pre-
dicted by MHD. The model presented was successfully checked
through Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations in Haggerty et al. (2022).
Although pair plasmas were considered in these works, preli minary
results ( Shalaby 2022 ) seem to indicate that the model holds for
electron/ion plasmas, provided the ions mass is used to deﬁn e the
dimensionless parameters ( 7).
An isotropic upstream has been assumed hitherto. The presen t
work is devoted to extend the model to the case of an anisotrop ic
upstream.
The kinetic history of the plasma as it crosses the shock fron t is
decomposed into 2 stages. First, the perpendicular tempera ture of the
plasma is conserved. This is Stage 1. If it is stable, then thi s is the end
state of the downstream. If Stage 1 is ﬁrehose unstable, it mi grates
to Stage 2 ﬁrehose, marginally ﬁrehose stable. If Stage 1 is m irror
unstable, it migrates to Stage 2 mirror, marginally mirror s table.
For an isotropic upstream with /u1D4341=1, it was found that Stage
1 can only be ﬁrehose unstable. Considering /u1D4341≠1 brings the
4Any point pertaining to the upper left region of ﬁgure 5(the one labelled
“/u1D4342>1, Stage 1 or Stage 2 mirror”), eventually leaves this region if/u1D712/bardbl1is
increased while /u1D4341is kept constant.possibility that Stage 1 be also mirror unstable. It also res tricts the
minimum ﬁeld strength to be considered since the upstream ha s to be
both mirror and ﬁrehose stable. The analysis splits the phas e space
parameters into 3 regions pictured in ﬁgure 5.
The upper part of ﬁgure 5has the downstream anisotropy /u1D4342
always larger than unity. There, for moderate values of the ﬁ eld, the
jump is given by Stage 2 mirror. Then, as soon as the ﬁeld is str ong
enough to stabilize Stage 1, the jump is the one of Stage 1. Fig ure
6(a) pictures some curves /u1D45F(/u1D70E)in this region.
In the middle part of ﬁgure 5, namely the shaded area, the down-
stream anisotropy /u1D4342is always larger than unity. Therefore, if un-
stable, Stage 1 can only be mirror unstable. Yet, in this regi on, the
smallest ﬁeld required to stabilize the upstream is larger t han the
smallest ﬁeld required to mirror-stabilize Stage 1. As a con sequence,
Stage 2 never occurs in this region. Figure 6(b) pictures some curves
/u1D45F(/u1D70E)in this region.
Finally, in the lower part of ﬁgure 5, the downstream anisotropy /u1D4342
is always lower than unity. If unstable, Stage 1 can only be ﬁr ehose
unstable. In many respects, this case is formally identical to the
isotropic case : at large /u1D70E, namely /u1D70E > /u1D70E/u1D450/u1D453, the jump is given by
Eq. (20), identical to the isotropic result. For /u1D70E < /u1D70E/u1D450/u1D453, the ﬁeld is
too weak to stabilize Stage 1 and the jump is given by Eq. ( 38, still
quite close to the /u1D4341=1 case since here, /u1D4341∈ [0,1]. In addition, the
critical sigma /u1D70E/u1D450/u1D453is also formally identical to its /u1D4341=1 value5. The
strong sonic shock limit /u1D712/bardbl1→ ∞ necessarily pertains to this case,
since this region is the only one of ﬁgure 5from which one cannot
escape when taking this limit. Figure 6(c) pictures some curves /u1D45F(/u1D70E)
in this region.
As explained in section 5.1, the present model requires /u1D712/bardbl1>√
3
to provide a positive entropy jump. From the deﬁnition of /u1D712/bardbl1given
by Eq. ( 7), we ﬁnd M/bardbl1=/u1D712/bardbl1/u1D6FE−1/2
/bardbl, where/u1D6FE/bardblis the parallel
adiabatic index and M/bardbl1the parallel upstream sonic Mach number.
Note that in an anisotropic collisionless plasma, the adiab atic index
is 3 in the direction parallel to the ﬁeld, and 2 in the perpend icular
directions ( Abraham-Shrauner 1967 ). Hence, the model can describe
shocks with M/bardbl1>1, for a parallel adiabatic index /u1D6FE/bardbl=3.
Future works should contemplate testing these results thro ugh PIC
simulations, like those of Bret & Narayan (2018) have been tested in
Haggerty et al. (2022).
