A numerical investigation of an asymptotically reduced model for quasi-geostrophic Rayleigh-
B´ enard convection is conducted in which the depth-averaged flows are numerically suppressed by
modifying the governing equations. At the largest accessible values of the Rayleigh number Ra,
the Reynolds number and Nusselt number show evidence of approaching the diffusion-free scalings
ofRe∼RaE/Pr andNu∼Pr−1/2Ra3/2E2, respectively, where Eis the Ekman number and
Pris the Prandtl number. For large Ra, the presence of depth-invariant flows, such as large-scale
vortices, yield heat and momentum transport scalings that exceed those of the diffusion-free scaling
laws. The Taylor microscale does not vary significantly with increasing Ra, whereas the integral
length scale grows weakly. The computed length scales remain O(1) with respect to the linearly
unstable critical wavenumber; we therefore conclude that these scales remain viscously controlled.
We do not find a point-wise Coriolis-Inertia-Archimedean (CIA) force balance in the turbulent
regime; interior dynamics are instead dominated by horizontal advection (inertia), vortex stretching
(Coriolis) and the vertical pressure gradient. A secondary, sub-dominant balance between the
Archimedean buoyancy force and the viscous force occurs in the interior and the ratio of the rms of
these two forces is found to approach unity with increasing Ra. This secondary balance is attributed
to the turbulent fluid interior acting as the dominant control on the heat transport. These findings
indicate that a pointwise CIA balance does not occur in the high Rayleigh number regime of
quasi-geostrophic convection in the plane layer geometry. Instead, simulations are characterized
by what may be termed a non-local CIA balance in which the buoyancy force is dominant within
the thermal boundary layers and is spatially separated from the interior Coriolis and inertial forces.
I. INTRODUCTION
Convection plays an important role in the dynamics of many planets and stars, where it
serves as the power source for sustaining the magnetic fields of the planets [1, 14, 25, 30] and
the Sun [4]. Convection may also be a possible driving mechanism for the observed large
scale zonal winds [e.g. 13] and vortices [e.g. 28] on the giant planets. The flows in these
natural systems are strongly forced and turbulent and can be constrained by the Coriolis
force. Studying rotationally constrained convective turbulence is therefore important for
improving understanding of such systems. However, experimental [5, 6, 19, 34] and numerical
2[9, 12, 35] investigations have difficulty accessing this parameter regime due to the extreme
scale separation that characterizes the dynamics. Asymptotic models play an important
role in this regard since they allow for significant computational savings by eliminating
physically unimportant dynamics while retaining the dominant force balance that is thought
to be representative of natural systems. In particular, the asymptotic model for rapidly
rotating convection in a planar geometry has been used to advance our understanding of
this system [17], and shows excellent agreement with the results of DNS where an overlap of
the parameter space is possible [23, 31]. Nevertheless, the behavior of the system in the dual
limit of strong buoyancy forcing andrapid rotation is still not completely understood [20].
In the present work we use numerical simulations of this asymptotic model for investigating
the scaling behavior of rotating convective turbulence at previously inaccessible parameter
values.
Rayleigh-B´ enard convection, consisting of a fluid layer of depth Hconfined between plane
parallel boundaries is a canonical system used for studying buoyancy-driven flows. The two
boundaries have temperature difference ∆ Tand a constant gravitational field of magnitude
gpoints perpendicular to the boundaries. The Rayleigh number
Ra=gα∆TH3
νκ, (1)
provides a non-dimensional measure of the buoyancy force. Here, αis the thermal expansion
coefficient, νis the kinematic viscosity and κis the thermal diffusivity. In most systems of
interest, the flow is strongly driven such that Ra≫Rac,where Racis the critical Rayleigh
number for the onset of convection. In the presence of a background rotation with angular
frequency Ω, the resulting convective dynamics are considered rotationally constrained, or
quasi-geostrophic (QG), when viscous forces and inertia are both small relative to the Coriolis
force. In non-dimensional terms, quasi-geostrophy is characterized by small Rossby and
Ekman numbers, respectively defined by,
Ro=U
2ΩH, E =ν
2ΩH2, (2)
where Uis a characteristic flow speed. In addition, the Reynolds number is given by Re=
UH/ν =Ro/E ; QG turbulence is characterized by Re≫1, and therefore E≪Ro≪1.
As an example, for the Earth’s outer core estimates suggest Ro=O(10−7),E=O(10−15)
andRe=O(108) [e.g. 25].
3An inverse kinetic energy cascade is known to occur in QG convection [7, 11, 18, 20, 26].
In the periodic plane layer geometry, the inverse cascade gives rise to a depth-invariant
large scale vortex (LSV) that tends to equilibrate with lateral dimensions comparable to the
horizontal size of the simulation domain. The LSV can then dynamically influence the under-
lying small scale convection. Previous studies have shown that the relative amount of kinetic
energy contained in the LSV and the small scale convection depends non-monotonically on
the forcing amplitude [11, 20]. In addition, the characteristic speed of the LSV depends lin-
early on the aspect ratio of the simulation domain [20, 22]. Although such coupling between
the large and small scale dynamics is directly relevant to natural systems, it nevertheless
complicates efforts to understand the strongly forced asymptotic regime of the small scale
convection.
Momentum and heat transport are characterized by Reand the Nusselt number, Nu,
respectively. Understanding the scaling of these two quantities in the high Rayleigh number
regime of QG convection is vital for relating model output to natural systems. QG convection
dynamics are conveniently specified by the asymptotic combination
fRa=RaE4/3, (3)
which we refer to as the reduced Rayleigh number. With this rescaling, the onset of con-
vection occurs at fRa≈8.7, and the onset of turbulence occurs when fRa>∼40 [18]. Pre-
vious work has found heat transport data that is consistent with the diffusion-free scaling,
Nu∼fRa3/2Pr−1/2, in the turbulent regime [9, 16], where Pr=ν/κis the Prandtl number.
However, recent investigations that allow for the amplitude of the LSV to fully saturate
have found a stronger scaling for Nu[20], which might suggest that although the small
scale convection approaches a Nu∼fRa3/2Pr−1/2, the interaction with the LSV provides
an additional enhancement of heat transport. A similar diffusion-free scaling for the flow
speeds is given by Re∼RaE/Pr implying a rotational free-fall velocity Urff=gα∆T/2Ω.
Recent studies of convection in a spherical geometry support this behavior [10]. However,
similar to their heat transport findings, Ref. [20] find that the Reynolds number scales more
strongly than the diffusion-free scaling.
A defining property of turbulence is the presence of a broad range of length scales within
the flow field. In spectral space this range of scales translates into a broadband kinetic
energy spectrum. The spectrum of non-rotating turbulence broadens via a forward cascade
4in which there is a net transfer of energy from low wavenumbers to high wavenumbers. A
consequence of this transfer of energy is that the length scale at which viscous dissipation
is dominant becomes ever smaller as Reincreases [e.g. 24].
The process by which spectral broadening occurs in QG convection is less clear. In the
limit E→0, linear theory shows that the onset of convection occurs on a length scale of
sizeℓ=O 
E1/3
. This length scale arises because the viscous force facilitates convection by
simultaneously perturbing the geostrophic force balance and relaxing the Taylor-Proudman
constraint. Understanding which length scales emerge in the strongly nonlinear regime
is important for characterizing QG convective turbulence. Previous studies in spherical
geometry suggest that the length scale varies with the Rossby number as ℓ∼Ro1/2[e.g. 10],
which is thought to arise from the so-called Coriolis-Inertia-Archimedean (CIA) balance [15].
In terms of the reduced Rayleigh number this scaling is equivalent to ℓ∼E1/3q
fRa/Pr [e.g.
2]. Recent experimental work using water as the working fluid has found a slightly weaker
scaling than ℓ∼Ro1/2[19]; this same investigation, and a numerical study of convection-
driven dynamos [35], finds that the correlation length scale of the vorticity is approximately
constant with increasing fRa. It is presently unknown whether this behavior persists in the
limit of large fRa.
In the present investigation we report on the results of numerical simulations of the
QG model of rotating convection in which the depth-invariant flows are suppressed. This
suppression is done to isolate the asymptotic behavior of the small-scale convection in the
absence of the LSV, and to simulate the largest accessible values of fRain an attempt to
identify asymptotic trends in the scaling behavior of various flow quantities. In Sec. II we
provide an overview of the QG model and numerical methods. Results and conclusions are
given in Sec. III and Sec. IV, respectively.
II. METHODS
A. Governing equations
In the present investigation we employ a modified version of the asymptotically reduced
form of the governing equations given by Ref. [29]. When non-dimensionalized using the
small-scale viscous diffusion speed ν/ℓ∗
ν, where ℓ∗
ν=HE1/3, and temperature scale ∆ T,
5these equations take the form

viaζ=∇2
⊥ψ. The mean temperature is denoted by Θ, where the overline represents a
horizontal average. We note that Θ =O(1) and ϑ=O(E1/3) in the asymptotic expansion.
The constant γis either one or zero. When γ= 0 the above equations are identical to
those used in many previous investigations [e.g. 20]. For simulations in which the depth-
averaged flow is suppressed we set γ= 1; in this case a depth-average of equation (4) yields
the diffusion equation
∂t⟨ζ⟩=∇2
⊥⟨ζ⟩, (8)
so that the depth-averaged vorticity (streamfunction) trivially decays to zero as t→ ∞ . In
practice, simulations in which the depth-averaged flow is suppressed were initialized from
states in which ⟨ψ⟩= 0.
Simulations are performed for the range 10 ≤fRa≤280 with Pr= 1. Details of the
numerical simulations are provided in Table I. The equations are solved using a de-aliased
pseudo-spectral method in which the flow variables are expanded as Chebyshev polynomials
in the vertical dimension and Fourier series in the horizontal dimensions. A third-order
accurate implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme is used to advance the equations in time.
Further details on the code can be found in Ref. [21].

maintained ( γ= 0), respectively. Both models were initialized from the same initial state.

simulations with fRa= 100. The simulation in which the depth-averaged flow is suppressed
(maintained) is denoted by γ= 1 ( γ= 0). Both simulations were initialized with identical
initial conditions. We compute the depth-averaged (barotropic, KE bt) and vertical ( KE Z)
kinetic energy densities, respectively defined as

KE btwhen γ= 1; the predicted decay rate for the dipolar vortex is shown for comparison
and excellent agreement is observed.
7B. Diagnostic quantities
Heat and momentum transport are quantified with the Nusselt number Nuand the
asymptotically reduced Reynolds number fRe, respectively. The Nusselt number is defined
by
Nu= 1 + Pr⟨wϑ⟩, (10)
where the angled brackets denote a volume and time average. The asymptotically rescaled
Reynolds number is defined based on the vertical component of the velocity field such that
fRe=E1/3Re=p
⟨w2⟩. (11)
For future reference, the relationship
fRa
Pr2(Nu−1) = εu, Nu =εθ (12)
can be derived from the governing equations under the condition γ= 0 or if the initial
condition is such that ⟨ψ⟩= 0 [18], where the viscous and thermal dissipation rates are
defined by, respectively,
εu=⟨|∇⊥w|2⟩+⟨ζ2⟩, ε θ=⟨|∇⊥θ|2⟩+⟨ 
∂ZΘ2⟩. (13)
The integral scale, Taylor microscale, Kolmogorov scale, and temperature integral scale
are calculated for each simulation and defined by, respectively,

noted by bEu(k) (bEϑ(k)), and the horizontal wavenumber vector is k= (kx, ky) with modulus

y.
The Kolmogorov scale is often interpreted as the scale at which viscosity dominates and
the turbulent kinetic energy is dissipated into heat [33]. The integral scale and Taylor
microscale are respectively interpreted as measures of the correlation length of turbulent
motions and the intermediate length scale at which fluid viscosity significantly affects the
dynamics of turbulent motions [24]. With these interpretations in mind, the relative ordering
ℓI> ℓT> ℓKholds. Furthermore, for rotating convection, viscosity is a required ingredient
8in destabilizing a rotating fluid subject to an adverse temperature gradient [3]. This implies
that convective motions are inherently influenced by viscosity and, as a consequence, the
Taylor microscale (assuming the physical interpetation holds) is tied to the linear instability
scale such that we anticipate ℓT=O(1). The integral scale for the temperature is interpreted
as the scale at which the fluid is forced by buoyancy.
III. RESULTS
A. Influence of simulation domain size
The presence of an inverse cascade complicates our understanding of rotating convection
since the flow speeds associated with the LSV are known to grow linearly with the horizontal
dimension of the simulation domain size [20]. This linear dependence is tied to the fact that
the inverse cascade is halted solely by the viscous force acting on the domain scale [22].
While we eliminate the LSV (and all depth-invariant motions) in the current investigation,
it is nevertheless important to determine the domain size that allows for convergence of
key statistical quantities. Towards this end, a series of simulations with fRa= 40 and
fRa= 100 were performed for varying domain sizes. Here we scale the horizontal dimension
of the simulation domain in integer multiples ( n) of the critical horizontal wavelength, λc≈
1.3048. The effective resolution (i.e. number of grid points per critical wavelength) was held
approximately constant as the domain size was varied. Figure 2 shows the sensitivity of Nu,
fRe, and the length scales ℓIandℓTas a function of n. We find that Nu,fRe, and ℓTshow
no significant sensitivity to domain size with n≥10, which is consistent with Ref. [20]. The
integral scale and the Taylor microscale also show little sensitivity to the box size beyond
n= 10. The focus of the present investigation is to reach the largest computationally
affordable values of fRa; for this reason we choose n= 10 for all of the data that is presented
in later subsections.
B. Heat and momentum transport
Panels (a) and (b) in Figure 3 show the compensated values Nu/fRa3/2andfRe/fRa,
respectively. As previously mentioned, these scalings are derived from CIA theory. For the
‘No LSV’ data we find that both compensated quantities exhibit steep initial increases up

convection [20]. Interestingly, we find that both the ‘No LSV’ cases and the ‘LSV’ cases
exhibit similar scaling trends over a certain range in fRa. We find that the removal of the
depth-averaged flow yields reduced heat and momentum transport relative to cases in which
this component of the flow is present.
With the scalings of Nu∼fRa3/2andfRe∼fRa, equations (10) and (11) indicate that the
fluctuating temperature scales as ϑ∼fRa1/2. To test this scaling we compute rms values of
the fluctuating temperature over various depths of the flow domain: (1) the maximum value
taken at the ‘edge’, or inflection point, of the thermal boundary layer; (2) averaged over the
entire layer depth 0 ≤Z≤1; and (3) averaged over the mid-depth range, 0 .4< Z < 0.6.
Figure 4(a) shows these values; Figure 4(b) shows the compensated values for the thermal
boundary layer and entire depth. We find that both the mid-depth and total depth rms
values scale with fRain the same manner, whereas the thermal boundary layer shows a
stronger dependence on fRa(Figure 4(b)), suggesting that the relative thinness of the thermal
boundary layer translates to an overall weaker influence of this region on the observed scaling
of the Nusselt number. From the data, it was difficult to determine the powerlaw scaling
forϑrmsin the boundary layer, as results differed significantly depending on the range of

data used. For example, fitting the data in Figure 4(b) for fRa > 80 gives a fRa0.95relation
while fitting over only the last three points ( fRa > 200) yields a fRa0.70scaling. Nevertheless,
we conclude that our results for ϑrmsin the thermal boundary layer are consistent with
the theoretically deduced fRa7/8scaling discussed in Ref. [16]. As previously reported in
Ref. [29], we observe saturation of the interior mean temperature gradient with a value of
−∂ZΘ≈0.4-0.5 (Figure 4(c)).

Kinetic energy spectra, bEu(k), and temperature variance spectra, bEϑ(k), are shown in

fRa= 10, both bEu(k) andbEϑ(k) show a well-defined peak near k/kbox= 10, corresponding to
ten unstable wavelengths in the domain. A broadening of dynamically active wavenumbers
is observed in both spectra as fRais increased. Figure 5(b) shows the kinetic energy spectra
compensated by the Kolmogorov scaling of k−5/3, which we find agrees well with the data.

contributes to more efficient heat and momentum transport. The temperature variance
spectra shown in Figure 5(c) corroborate this behavior; with the LSV we find significantly
more energy in the k/kbox= 1 mode in comparison to the same case without a LSV. We
also note that in comparison to bEu(k), we find that bEϑ(k) shows a significantly slower

decay in amplitude with increasing k, indicating that buoyancy forcing in the vicinity of the
critical wavenumber remains important even at very large values of fRa. The compensated
temperature variance spectra shown in Figure 5(d) illustrates this slow decay where an
empirical scaling of k−2/5flattens the spectra in the intermediate wavenumber range.
Various length scales of the velocity field can be computed from the kinetic energy spectra.
Definitions for the integral length scale, the Taylor microscale and the Kolmogorov length
scale in terms of the kinetic energy spectrum and vorticity (dissipation) are given in equation
(14). Each of these quantities are plotted in Figure 6(a) for all simulations. We also plot
the integral scale ℓϑ
Icomputed from bEϑ, which represents a measure of the buoyancy driving
scale. For the LSV cases, the length scales are calculated using only the baroclinic kinetic
energy for better comparison with the present results. The length scales are shown in units
of the critical horizontal wavelength and we find that all length scales are close to this critical
15wavelength just above the onset of convection (i.e. when fRa= 10). Generally, the integral
length scale is found to be a slowly increasing function of fRaregardless of whether the LSV
is present or not. At fRa= 280 we find that the integral scale is approximately three times
the size of the critical wavelength. In comparison to the integral scale, the Taylor microscale
shows an initial increase up to fRa= 20 followed by a slight decrease. For fRa≥80,the
average value of the Taylor microscale is ℓT= 0.96 and the standard deviation is 0 .02. Both
the integral length scale and the Taylor microscale exhibit scaling behavior that is weaker
than the fRa1/2scaling law. The Kolmogorov scale exhibits an obvious decrease with fRaand,
for the parameter regime accessible here, is the only computed length scale that becomes
significantly different in value than the critical wavelength. For LSV cases, ℓKis found to
be slightly smaller in comparison to cases without the LSV; this result is in agreement with
the heat transport data which shows LSV cases have larger heat transport and therefore
larger viscous dissipation. The integral temperature scale remains O(1) up to fRa= 280,
which suggests that the buoyancy forcing scale occurs at a viscous length scale. ℓϑ
Ireaches
a maximum value at fRa= 50 ,which is coincident with the local maxima for the scaled
NuandfRedata shown in figure 3. Around fRa≥120,ℓϑ
Ibegins to slowly increase. This
behaviour is co-incident with a decrease in ℓϑ
Ifor the LSV cases. It appears that a crossover
inℓϑ
Ifor cases with the LSV and cases without a LSV occurs around fRa= 180. This result
suggests that at large fRa, the LSV facilitates the buoyancy forcing at smaller scales than
those without the LSV.
Due to the similarity between the computed length scales and the linearly unstable wave-
length, we show an alternative presentation of length scales based on comparisons with the
marginal stability boundary and the fastest growing linearly unstable modes in Figure 6(b).
The marginal stability boundary is defined by
fRamarg=k4+π2k−2. (15)
The small and large wavenumber scalings of k−2andk4are also shown where we note
that the former is consistent with CIA theory in that it represents a diffusion-free scaling
behavior. We find that none of the computed length scales exhibit scaling behavior that is
similar to this diffusion-free trend, though there are ranges of fRaover which these length
scales grow faster than the diffusion-free trend.

which can be plugged into equations (4)-(7) using the relation ∇2

The fastest growing mode is found by taking the global maximum of λfor a given value of
fRa.In the limit of large fRa, this analysis suggests that the length scale associated with the
fastest growing mode scales like ℓfast∼fRa−1/8; we find that ℓIshows a scaling behavior that
is similar to this trend. Figure 6b shows the fastest growing mode for ∂ZΘ = 0 .5. However,
the scaling behavior of the fastest growing mode does not vary with different values of ∂ZΘ.
Instantaneous physical space visualizations of the fluctuating temperature and vertical
vorticity are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively, for fRa= 40 (a,d), fRa= 160 (b,e) and
fRa= 280 (c,f). For each value of fRa, all visualizations are taken at the same instant in
time. Vertical slices are shown in the top row of panels (a)-(c) and horizontal slices taken
from the mid-plane of the fluid layer are shown in the bottom row of panels (a)-(c); the
dot-dashed lines in (a)-(c) mark the intersection of the vertical and horizontal planes in
the top and bottom rows, respectively. Panels (d)-(f) show horizontal slices at depths in
which ϑrmsreaches its maximum value, i.e. at the edge of the thermal boundary layer. The
visualizations confirm that the characteristic size of the large scale flow patterns in the fluid
interior, as quantified by the integral length scale, is weakly dependent on the Rayleigh
number since all three cases show similar large scale structure. Moreover, these large scale
structures show significant axial coherence even in the absence of depth-averaged flows. Even
forfRa= 280, flow structures that span nearly the entire depth can be identified. However,
it can be observed in both fields that the vertical length scale of coherence within the interior
decreases with increasing fRa. This is discussed in the context of non-local CIA theory in
the final section. The thermal boundary layer visualizations show evidence of strong spatial
correlation between the thermal and vortical fields. While the size of the largest vortical
structures remain largely insensitive to fRa, it is observed that the filamentary structures
become increasingly finer which is consistent with the theoretical findings in Ref. [16]. For
the vortical field, this fine scale is imprinted into the interior whereas the interior spatial

D. Balances
In an effort to understand the scaling behavior of the various quantities discussed thus
far, we compute rms values of all terms appearing in equations (4)-(6). Vertical profiles of
these quantities are shown in Figure 10 for fRa= 200, which is a value that is representative
of the turbulent regime. The data shown in each plot is computed by squaring each term
in the respective equations, averaging this quantity over the horizontal plane, taking the
square root, and then averaging in time. The material derivative Dtis the rms of the
sum of all forcing terms with the advective terms subtracted off ( i.e. for the vorticity
equation (4), rms( Dtζ) = rms( ∂Zw+∇2
⊥ζ)). Note that a logarithmic scale is used on the
vertical axis of each figure to illustrate the differences in balances that occur in the interior
with those that occur within the thermal boundary layer. We find that advection and
the time derivative terms are largest in each of the three equations throughout the fluid
layer, which agrees with the results of Ref. [20] for simulations in which depth-invariant
flows were present. However, the dynamics are controlled by the material derivative, rather
than the time derivative and advection separately. Panel (a) shows that Dtζand∂zw
are nearly identical in magnitude throughout the fluid layer. However, while smaller, the
diffusion of vorticity remains comparable in magnitude to these two terms; in the fluid
interior (0 .5> Z > 0.1) we find rms( ∇2
⊥ζ)∼2×103, whereas rms( Dtζ)∼4×103and

rms(∂zw)∼4×103. Within the thermal boundary layer ( Z<∼10−3) we find that all terms
in the vorticity equation are important, indicating that the large amplitude vortical motions
are directly influenced by viscous diffusion at the boundaries.
For the vertical momentum equation balances shown in Figure 10(b) we find that Dtw
and∂Zψare of nearly identical magnitude in the fluid interior, whereas the buoyancy force
and diffusion terms are comparable in magnitude and the smallest of all terms in the inte-
rior. These results show that the vertical pressure gradient acts as the dominant driver of
vertical motion in the interior. In the thermal boundary layer we find that all terms in the
vertical momentum equation become comparable in magnitude, though as a consequence of
impenetrability, diffusion remains the smallest of all terms. Figure 10(c) shows a tendency in
the interior for the horizontal material advection of fluctuating temperature to be balanced
by horizontal thermal diffusion, whereas all terms become comparable in magnitude within
the thermal boundary layer.
Figure 11 show ratios of rms values of various terms in the vertical momentum and
vertical vorticity equations as function of fRa. The rms values are the depth-averaged values
of vertical profiles similar to those shown in Figure 10(b). We find that the ratio of the
22vertical viscous force to the buoyancy force approaches unity as fRais increased. Given
the scaling behavior of the rms fluctuating temperature, ϑrms(as shown in Figure 4(a))
this data indicates that the viscous force increases at a rate faster than fRa1/2until unity is
reached in the force balance. This balance between the viscous force and the buoyancy force
is attributed to the observation that the fluid interior controls heat transport in the large
Rayleigh number regime of rapidly rotating convection [16]. The ratios of the viscous force
to the pressure gradient force and the diffusion of vertical vorticity to vortex stretching are
slowly decreasing functions of fRa. From our data, while it appears that the magnitude of
the globally averaged influence of viscosity is subdominant from that of the pressure gradient
or vortex stretching in the limit of large fRa, it is unclear whether asymptotic subdominance
holds for fRa→ ∞ .
IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The QG equations (4)–(7) represent the asymptotic low Rossby number limit of the
buoyantly forced Navier-Stokes equations. Simulations of these equations were performed
in which the depth-invariant flows were entirely suppressed. The suppression was done to
isolate the dynamics of the small scale convection and to enable simulations at previously
inaccessible values of fRa. A comparison was made with data from previously published sim-
ulations of the asymptotic model in which large amplitude, depth-invariant flows (e.g. LSVs)
were present. This comparison has allowed for additional insight into the physics of small
scale, QG convective turbulence, which drives the inverse kinetic energy cascade in this sys-
tem. Asymptotically reduced Rayleigh and Reynolds numbers up to fRa= 280 and fRe≈100
were simulated, which represents the most extreme parameter regime accessed to date for
QG convection in either the plane layer or spherical geometry. Recent DNS studies have
reached small scale Reynolds numbers up to fRe≈33 in the plane layer [35, 36], and up to
fRe≈24 in a spherical shell geometry [27]. Ref. [10] used a non-asymptotic two-dimensional
model in the equatorial region of a full sphere to reach fRe≈20. For context, estimates
suggest that characteristic flow speeds in the Earth’s outer core yield reduced Reynolds
numbers of fRe≈103−104, clearly indicating that it is necessary to understand the physics
of QG convection at large values of the reduced parameters.
A subset of simulations were performed in which the horizontal dimensions of the simula-
23tion domain were systematically varied. In agreement with previous studies of non-rotating
convection [e.g. 32], we find that globally averaged statistics, such as the Nusselt number
and the Reynolds number, converge rapidly for horizontal dimensions that are larger than
ten critical horizontal wavelengths (Figure 2). The calculated length scales remained ap-
proximately constant across the different domain sizes.
Our investigation finds evidence that in the absence of depth-invariant flows both the heat
and momentum transport approach asymptotic scaling regimes for large Rayleigh numbers
(Figure 3), though these scaling regimes occur only at the largest accessible values of fRa.
When generalized to non-unity Prandtl numbers, these scalings are Nu∼Pr−1/2fRa3/2
andfRe∼fRa/Pr . When recast in terms of large scale quantities these scalings become
Nu∼Pr−1/2Ra3/2E2andRe∼RaE/Pr , which represent diffusion-free scalings when
interpreted on the large domain scale [2].
The simulations that include depth-invariant flows exhibit heat and momentum transport
that is more efficient than the aforementioned diffusion-free scalings [20]. This diffusion
dependence is of interest when considering applications to geophysical and astrophysical
systems in which large-scale flows, such as zonal jets and vortices, are present.
Kinetic energy spectra and temperature variance spectra were computed for all values of
fRa(Figure 5). We find evidence of a Kolmogorov-like subrange in which the kinetic energy
spectra scales with the horizontal wavenumber as k−5/3.However, since we find that the
inertial scale is a viscous scale, we believe that this subrange is distinct from the classical
picture of a Kolmogorov inertial subrange. The kinetic energy spectra show that there is a
build up of energy at smaller wavenumbers as fRais increased, though the energy contained
in these larger scale structures remains comparable to that contained in scales similar to the
critical wavelength. The temperature variance spectra exhibit similar behavior, indicating
that the system remains forced on a length scale that is comparable to the critical wavelength
at the highest Rayleigh number investigated.
The evolution of various length scales in the system was investigated for varying fRa. We
find that the integral length scale ℓIincreases with fRa, but at a rate that is slower than
the diffusion free scaling ∝(fRa/Pr )1/2suggested by a CIA balance. The Taylor microscale
remains nearly constant with increasing fRa, whereas the Kolmogorov length scale decreases
with increasing fRa. The temperature integral scale ℓϑ
Iwas was found to behave similarly
to the integral scale, albeit with a more pronounced peak at fRa= 50. Both integral length
24scales show increases for fRa > 100. One of the key findings of this investigation is that
all of these length scales remain comparable to the linearly unstable critical wavelength
that emerges at the onset of convection. We note that the scaling behavior of the integral
scale and Taylor microscale are consistent with recent laboratory experiments of rotating
convection [19] and a numerical study of rotating convection-driven dynamos in the plane
layer [35]. These findings provide evidence that the broadening of the length scales in
rotating convective turbulence is an extremely slow function of the Rayleigh number, and
occurs in a fundamentally different manner in comparison to non-rotating turbulence. In
particular, studies of non-rotating convection find that both the integral length scale and
the Taylor microscale decrease rapidly with increasing Rayleigh number [e.g. 37].
An explanation for the aforementioned contrast to the non-rotating case resides in the
fact that viscosity is a required ingredient in destabilizing a rotating fluid subject to an
adverse temperature gradient in the presence of the Taylor-Proudman constraint [3]. Even
in the turbulent regime, the Taylor-Proudman constraint is relaxed on the length scale
associated with unit Ro. In rapid rotation, this is a viscous length which scales as Ek1/3.
Convective motions are therefore inextricably influenced by viscosity and, by definition, the
Taylor microscale is tied to the linear instability scale ℓ∗
ν=E1/3H. We propose an alternate
scaling motivated by linear theory. For a fixed mean temperature gradient, we find that
the most unstable mode grows with fRalikek−8,suggesting a length scale of ℓ∼fRa1/8.
Our data (Figure 6(b)) for the integral scales at large fRaseem to agree with this scaling
better than the dissipation-free scale predicted by CIA theory ∝fRa1/2.This connection
to linear theory is demonstrated by comparisons between the computed lengths and the
marginal stability curve (Figure 6(b)). We note that the latter scaling resides at the long
wavelength marginal stability boundary for convective onset. The comparisons with linear
theory in which a mean temperature profile with gradient ∂ZΘ =−1 might remain pertinent
in the nonlinear regime given that the observed nonlinear profile saturates with a gradient
∼ −0.5 (Figure 4(c)). The permissible convectively unstable length scales within the bulk
thus adhere to the same analytic structure as deduced from the marginal stability at linear
onset.
Congruent with the lack of agreement between the measured integral length scale and
that predicted by CIA theory, the force balances also do not show evidence of a CIA balance
within the fluid interior, as might be predicted from scaling arguments. Instead we find a
25trend indicating that this balance is never approached as the system becomes more strongly
forced since there is a subdominant balance between the buoyancy force and viscous diffusion
of vertical momentum in the interior. The ratio of the rms of these two forces approaches
unity as fRais increased, which we attribute to the fact that the fluid interior controls heat
transport in rapidly rotating convection [e.g. 16]. The buoyancy force is strongest within the
thermal boundary layer and comparable to all other forces, including viscous forces, in that
region. Moreover, the strong, horizontal, vortical flows that are present at the boundary
are balanced entirely by viscosity. Convective overturning motions in the interior are driven
primarily by vertical pressure gradients, and vortical motions are driven by vortex-stretching.
However, neither of these forces are sources of potential energy injection which must then
be provided from within the boundary regions.
A possibility for the departure from a CIA balance is that there is no buoyancy term
in the vorticity equation (4) because gravity and rotation are antiparallel in this geometry.
However, we might still expect a balance between buoyancy and the material derivative in
the vertical momentum equation, which we do not observe. Nevertheless, it would be of
interest to determine if the angle between the gravity and rotation vectors plays a role in
the scaling behavior and balances that are observed in simulations. Such an investigation
would be important for relating the results of plane layer and spherical simulations [e.g. 8].
If we accept that the NuandfRescalings are trending towards the dissipation-free scaling
provided by CIA theory, then there appears to be a juxtaposition between global transport
laws and the observed integral length scaling. This apparent contradiction can be resolved
by analyzing force balances within the fluid interior and boundary layers. Indeed, balances
in the governing equations can often be used to derive various scaling laws for the Rayleigh
number dependence of flow length scales. Towards this end we have computed the magni-
tudes of the various terms appearing in the governing equations of the asymptotic model
(Figure 10). In agreement with previous simulations with depth-invariant flows, we find
that within the interior the turbulent regime is predominantly characterized by the passive
horizontal advection of each of the flow quantities (vertical vorticity, vertical velocity and
fluctuating temperature). Details of the evolution of the flow quantities are best viewed
by following fluid elements in a Lagrangian framework. This captures the hierarchy of sec-
ondary forces which drive the horizontal material advection, as defined by Dt. We find
that the following analysis is best pursued utilizing a dimensional approach, followed by a
26reconversion to dimensionless quantities. Considering the vertical momentum and vorticity
equations in dimensional form, we find

⊥w∗, (16)
D∗
t∗ζ∗∼2Ω∂Z∗w∗> ν∇∗2
⊥ζ∗. (17)
We therefore find an interior Coriolis-Inertial (CI) balance in which the geostrophic pressure
gradient and vortex stretching forces are the dominant secondary forces in the hierarchy.
Furthermore, the rms buoyancy and rms viscous forces are comparable in magnitude and are
the smallest of all terms. We note that these balances are consistent with those found in DNS
studies of rotating convection [12] and rotating convection-driven dynamos [35], and they
imply that interior forcing and viscous dissipation play a subdominant role in the dynamics.
Consequently, the observed dynamics must be driven externally by buoyant (A)rchimedean
forces arising within the thermal boundary layer.
To summarize, we observe what may be termed a non-local CIA balance where the action
of the Archimedean buoyancy force occurring within the thermal boundary layers is spatially
separated from the interior Coriolis and inertial forces. It can now be shown that this finding
resolves the dichotomy of not finding a diffusion-free integral scale ℓ∗
Ias predicted by a local
CIA balance. Assuming velocities achieve rotational free-fall, as presently observed, and
that pressure is the geostrophic streamfunction, i.e.,

such that unlike the momentum field, material advection (or stirring) of the temperature
field is balanced by dissipation (mixing). This can be observed by comparing the spatial
morphologies of the midplane snapshots for temperature and vorticity in which the former
quantity exhibits broader structures due to enhanced diffusion.
The results presented in this study highlight the non-trivial behavior of rapidly rotating
convection and provide a foundation for comparison with DNS and experiment in both the
plane-layer and spherical geometries. By removal of the LSV, our study was able to investi-
gate the origin of the inverse cascade and our results demonstrate how rotating convection
departs from the theory of isotropic, homogenous turbulence. Most significantly, we have
shown that diffusion free force-balance arguments, even in the regime of large Reprovide
an incomplete picture of the convective dynamics, and are insufficient when attempting to
identify the pertinent length scales in the flow. Instead, our investigations reveal that the
interior, despite controlling the global momentum and heat transport, is forced externally by
the boundary layers. Therefore, we conclude that QG dynamics at large Rayleigh number
should not be considered diffusion free.
Several open questions are apparent from this investigation, including: Does the
geostrophic regime accessed in this study accurately represent the flow regime for fRa→ ∞ ?
If not, does a new, higher fRaregime exist in which the impact of molecular dissipation is
28diminished? To what extent does domain geometry impact the ultimate scaling theory? In-
vestigating these questions remains challenging to laboratory studies and DNS given present
difficulties in investigating broad ranges of the extreme geostrophic parameter regime.
