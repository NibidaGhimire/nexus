arXiv:2303.11407v1  [eess.SY]  20 Mar 2023Distributed Resilient Interval Observers for Bounded-Err or LTI
Systems Subject to False Data Injection Attacks
Mohammad Khajenejad∗, Scott Brown∗, and Sonia Mart´ ınez
Abstract — This paper proposes a novel distributed interval-
valued simultaneous state and input observer for linear tim e-
invariant (LTI) systems that are subject to attacks or unkno wn
inputs, injected both on their sensors and actuators. Each
agent in the network leverages a singular value decompositi on
(SVD) based transformation to decompose its observations i nto
two components, one of them unaffected by the attack signal,
which helps to obtain local interval estimates of the state and
unknown input and then uses intersection to compute the best
interval estimate among neighboring nodes. We show that the
computed intervals are guaranteed to contain the true state
and input trajectories, and we provide conditions under whi ch
the observer is stable. Furthermore, we provide a method for
designing stabilizing gains that minimize an upper bound on
the worst-case steady-state observer error. We demonstrat e our
algorithm on an IEEE 14-bus power system.
I. I NTRODUCTION
The control of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) relies on the
tight integration of various computational, communicatio n,
and sensor components that interact with each other and
with the physical world in a complex way. Applications
of CPS are broad and include, to name a few, industrial
infrastructures [1], power grids [2], and intelligent tran s-
portation systems [3]. In such safety-critical systems, serious
detriment can occur in case of malfunction or if jeopardized
by malicious attackers [4]. One of the most serious types
of attacks consists of false-data injection, by which coun-
terfeit data signals are injected into the actuator signals and
sensor measurements by strategic and/or malicious agents.
Such attacks are not well-modeled by zero-mean, Gaussian
white noises nor by signals with known bounds, given their
strategic nature. On the other hand, most of the centralized
approaches to state estimation are computationally expens ive,
especially for realistic high-dimensional CPS. Consequen tly,
reliable distributed state and unknown input estimation al -
gorithms are indispensable for the sake of resilient contro l,
attack identiﬁcation, and mitigation.
Motivated by this, several estimation algorithms have been
proposed, in which a central entity seeks to estimate both
the system state and the unknown disturbance (input). In the
context where the noise signals are Gaussian and white, a
large body of work proposed different designs for joint inpu t
and state estimation via e.g., minimum variance unbiased
estimation [5], modiﬁed double-model adaptive estimation

This work is partially funded by ARL and ONR grants W911NF-23 -2-
0009 and N00014-19-1-2471.[6], or robust regularized least square approaches [7]. How -
ever, these approaches are not applicable in the context of
attack-resilient bounded error worst-case estimation against
false data injection attacks, where no information about th e
distribution of uncertainties is available. In such a setti ng,
numerous approaches were proposed for deterministic sys-
tems [8], stochastic systems [9], and bounded-error system s
[10]–[12]. These approaches typically yield point estimat es,
i.e, the most likely or best single estimate, as opposed to
set-valued estimates.
Set-valued estimates have the advantage of providing hard
accuracy bounds, which are important to guarantee safety
[13]–[16]. In addition, the use of ﬁxed-order set-valued meth-
ods can help decrease the complexity of optimal observers
[17], which grows with time. Hence, ﬁxed-order centralized
set-valued observers were presented for different classes of
systems [13], [18]–[23], that simultaneously ﬁnd bounded
sets of compatible states and unknown inputs. However,
these algorithms do not scale well in a networked setting
as the size of the network increases. This motivates the
design of distributed input and state ﬁlters , which have
typically focused on systems with stochastic disturbances
[24], [25]. While these methods are more scalable and robust
to communication failures than their centralized counterp arts,
they generally have comparatively worse estimation error.
Moreover, they are not applicable in bounded-error setting s
where no information about the stochastic characteristics
of noise/disturbance is available. With that in mind, in our
previous work [26] we provided a distributed algorithm to
synthesize interval observers for bounded-error LTI syste ms,
without considering unknown input signals (attacks). In th is
work we aim to extend our design in [26] to address re-
siliency against false data injection attacks, i.e., to synthesize
distributed interval observers in the bounded-error setti ngs
that are stable and correct in the presence of unknown
input/attack signals.
Contributions. This work aims to bridge the gap between
distributed resilient estimation algorithms and interval ob-
server design approaches in bounded-error settings and sub -
ject to completely unknown and/or distribution-free input s
(attacks). In other words, leveraging the notion of “collec -
tive positive detectability over neighborhoods” (CPDN), w e
provide a distributed algorithm that simultaneously synth e-
sizes tractable and computationally efﬁcient interval-va lued
estimates for states and unknown inputs of bounded error
LTI systems, whose sensors and actuators are subject to fals e
data injection attacks. We provide conditions for the stabi lity
of our proposed observer, which is shown to minimize acomputed upper bound for the observer error interval widths .
II. P RELIMINARIES
This section introduces basic notation, preliminary con-
cepts, and graph-theoretic notions used throughout the pap er.
Notation. LetN,Z≥0,R≥0, denote the sets of natural,
nonnegative integer and real numbers, respectively. Simil arly,
RnandRn×pdenote the n-dimensional Euclidean space, and
the set of n×pmatrices, respectively. Given A1,...,AN∈
Rn×n,diag(A1,...,AN)∈RnN×nNis the block-diagonal
matrix with block-diagonal elements Ai,i∈{1,...,N}. For
M∈Rn×p,MiandMijdenote the ithrow and the (i,j)th
entry of M, respectively. Furthermore, we deﬁne M+∈
Rn×p, such that M+
ij/definesmax{Mij,0},M−/definesM+−M, and
|M|/definesM++M−. All inequalities≤,≥, as well as max
andmin, are considered element-wise. Given M∈Rn×n,
ρ(M)is used to denote the spectral radius of M. A multi-
dimensional interval is denoted as I/defines[s,s]⊂Rn, and is
the set of vectors x∈Rnsuch that s≤x≤s.
Proposition 1. [27, Lemma 1] Let A∈Rp×nandx≤x≤
x∈Rn. Then,A+x−A−x≤Ax≤A+x−A−x. As a
corollary, if Ais non-negative, Ax≤Ax≤Ax.
Graph-theoretic Notions. A directed graphG= (V,E)is
a set of nodesV/defines{1,...,N}and edgesE⊆V×V . The
neighbors of node i, denotedNi, is the set of all nodes jfor
which(j,i)∈E. We will assume that i∈Ni.
III. P ROBLEM FORMULATION
System Assumptions. Consider a multi-agent system (MAS)
consisting of Nagents, which interact over a time-invariant
communication graph Ga. The agents are able to obtain
individual measurements of a target system as described by
the following LTI dynamics:
P:/braceleftBigg
xk+1=Axk+Bwk+Gdk,
yi
k=Cixk+Divi
k+Hidk, i∈V,k∈Z≥0,(1)
wherexk∈Rnis the continuous state of the target system,
dk∈Rnpis a malicious disturbance andwk∈ Iw/defines
[w,w]⊂Rnwis bounded process noise. At time step k,
every agent i∈V takes a measurement yi
k∈Rmi, known
only to itself, which is perturbed by vi
k∈Ii
v/defines[vi,vi]⊂
Rni
v, a bounded sensor (measurement) noise signal. Finally,
A∈Rn×n,B∈Rn×nw,G∈Rn×np,Ci∈Rmi×n,
Di∈Rmi×ni
v, andHi∈Rmi×npare system matrices
known to all agents, where rank(Hi) =ri. Note that no
restriction is made on Hito be either the zero matrix (no
direct feedthrough), or to have full column rank when there
is direct feedthrough. The agents’ goal is to simultaneousl y
estimate the trajectories of (1) as well as the unknown input
dkin a distributed manner, when states are initialized in an
intervalIx/defines[x0,x0]⊂Rn, withx0,x0known to all agents.
aLater, the structure of the graph will play an important role in the
satisfaction of Assumption 2. We don’t, however, require an y speciﬁc
assumptions about connectivity of the graph. Loosely speak ing, if individual
nodes have access to many complementary measurements, the g raph need
not be “well connected”. The converse is also true, that a “we ll connected”
graph can overcome a lack of individual measurements.Unknown Input Signal Assumptions. We make no assump-
tion about the unknown signal dk, i.e., we require no prior
knowledge such as its distribution, dynamics, or bounds.
Remark 1. System (1) can be easily extended to cover
the case where different attack signals ds
k∈Rnsand
do
k∈Rnowith the corresponding matrices ˆG∈Rn×ns
andˆHi∈Rmi×noare injected into the actuators and
sensors, respectively. In this case, courtesy of the fact th at
the unknown input signals can be completely arbitrary, by
lumping them into a newly deﬁned unknown input signal

can equivalently transform the considered system to a new

The problem of designing a distributed resilient state and
input interval observer addressed here is cast as follows:
Problem 1. Given a multi-agent system, design a distributed
resilient interval observer for P, i.e., an algorithm that
computes uniformly bounded state and input framers for P.
IV. P ROPOSED DISTRIBUTED INTERVAL OBSERVER
In this section, we describe our novel resilient distribute d
interval observer design, its stability, and a tractable di s-
tributed procedure for computing stabilizing observer gai ns.
A. Distributed Input and State Framer and its Correctness
Before describing our proposed observer, we ﬁrst trans-
form the system into an equivalent representation which
decouples the problem of estimating the state and the ad-
versarial input. Inspired by the work in [13], we carry out
a singular value decomposition (SVD) on the feedthrough
matrixHi, which decomposes the unknown input signal
into two components di
1,kanddi
2,k. Consequently, we obtain
two constituents for the measurement signal: zi
1,k, which
is affected by the unknown input through an invertible
feedthrough matrix Si∈Rri×ri, andzi
2,k, which is not
compromised by the unknown input signal. Then, (1) can
be represented as
xk+1=Axk+Bwk+Gi

and the concatenated noise vector ηi
k/defines[vi⊤
k−1w⊤
k−1vi⊤
k]⊤
with upper and lower bounds:
ηi/defines[vi⊤w⊤vi⊤]⊤andηi/defines[vi⊤w⊤vi⊤]⊤.
To obtain input and state estimates, we require that each
agent has access to adequate measurements which are not
compromised by the unknown input. The following assump-
tion ensures this. We refer the reader to [13, Lemma 1] for
a discussion on the necessity of this type of requirement in
centralized estimation algorithms subject to adversaries . In a
nutshell, unless this type of observability conditions hol d, an
adversary can arbitrarily drive system components around i n
a fully stealthy manner.
Assumption 1. Ci
2Gi
2is full column rank for every i∈V.b
Hence, there exists Mi
2= (Ci
2Gi
2)†such that Mi
2Ci
2Gi
2=I.
It is worth noting that Ci
2andGi
2are both afﬁne trans-
formations of CandG, respectively. Moreover, adequacy
of measurements plays an important role when applying
a singular value decomposition on the direct feedthrough
matrix in the output equation (cf. Appendix A for more
details). We are ready to propose our recursive distributed
simultaneous state and unknown input observer.
B. Distributed Input and State Framer and its Correctness
To address Problem 1, we propose a four-step procedure,
summarized as the D ISTRIBUTED SIMULTANEOUS INPUT
& S TATE INTERVAL OBSERVER (DSISO) in Algorithm 1.
i) State Propagation and Measurement Update: Givenxi
k,
xi
k,zi
1,k,zi
2,k, andzi
2,k+1, each agent i∈V performs a state
propagation and a local measurement update step using to-
be-designed observer gains LiandΓi∈Rn×mi:

k+1,
xi0
k+1=Ai+xi
k−Ai−xi
k+Li+ηi−Li−ηi+Ψiξi
k+1,(5)
whereAi,Li, andΨi, which deﬁne the observer dynamics,
depend linearly on LiandΓiand are described in Ap-
pendix B, and ξi
k+1/defines/bracketleftbig(zi

also note that Aihas the form Ai/definesTiˆAi−LiCi
2, where
Ti=I−ΓiCi

ii) State Framer Network Update: Each agent ishares its
local state framers with its neighbors in the network, updat -
ing them by taking the tightest interval from all neighbors
via intersection,

We consider only one iteration of this operation for simplic -
ity; the extension to multiple iterations is straightforwa rd.

Remark 2. There are many existing centralized interval
observer designs in the literature that could potentially b e
used for step i). However, most of these methods rely
on similarity transformations [28] which depend on the
observation matrices Ci. In a multi-agent setting, use of
these methods necessitates transforming to and from the
original coordinates whenever estimates are shared over th e
network. Each repeated transformation incurs the so-calle d
“wrapping effect” as a result of Proposition 1, which worsen s
the estimation error and negates the beneﬁt of exchanging
information over the network. We avoid this with the choice
of (5), which is computed directly in the original coordinat es.

C. Distributed Stabilizing and Error Minimization
In this subsection, we investigate conditions on the ob-
server gains LiandΓi, as well as the communication graph
G, that lead to an input-to-state stable (ISS)cdistributed
cThe reader is referred to [26, Deﬁnition 2] for a detailed des cription of
an ISS interval observer.observer, which equivalently results in a uniformly bounde d
observer error sequence given in (2)–(3), in the presence of
bounded noise. To guarantee stability, we use the following
assumption on the agents’ observation matrices and the
structure of the network graph.
Assumption 2 (Collective Positive Detectability over Neigh-
borhoods (CPDN) [26]) .For every state dimension s∈
{1,...,n}and every agent i∈V, there is an agent ℓ(i,s)∈
Nisuch that there exist gains Lℓ(i,s), andΓℓ(i,s)satisfying
/bardbl(Tℓ(i,s)ˆAℓ(i,s)−Lℓ(i,s)Cℓ(i,s)
2)s/bardbl1<1.
Intuitively, this assumption narrows the problem of stabil -
ity to subgraphs. Within these subgraphs, we require that fo r
each state dimension s, there is a node that, given estimates
of all other state dimensions {1,...,s−1,s+ 1,...,n},
can compute an accurate estimate of dimension s. With this
assumption in mind, we propose a two-step process to design
the observer gains LiandΓi. First, each node executes
a procedure (Algorithm 2) which veriﬁes Assumption 2,
returning false if it is not satisﬁed, or else computes some
feasible stabilizing gains and the set of state dimensions
which a node can contribute to estimating, i.e.,
Ji/defines{s:∃Ti,Li,Γis.t./bardbl(TiAi−LiCi
2)s/bardbl1<1}.
Then, given this information, each node solves the LP in
(9), which simultaneously guarantees stability and minimizes
an upper bound on the observer error. This design process
improves on the one proposed in [26] in the absence of
attacks, by ﬁrst identifying “stabilizing” agents for each state
dimension, then minimizing an upper bound on the error
while enforcing the stability condition. In this way, the de sign
includes a sense of noise/error attenuation. The following
theorem formalizes our main results on how to tractably
synthesize stabilizing and error minimizing observer gain s
in a distributed manner.
Theorem 1 (Distributed Input and State Interval Observer
Design) .Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold and Li

whereLiis deﬁned in (5)andJiis calculated using Algo-
rithm 2. Then, the DSISO algorithm, i.e., (5)–(8), with the
corresponding observer gains Li
∗,Ti
∗,Γi
∗constructs an ISS
distributed input and state interval observer. Moreover, t he
steady state observer errors are guaranteed to be bounded:
/bardblex

/bardblδk/bardbl∞≤ρ(Ad)

η/bardbl∞+max i/bardbl|Fi|∆i
η/bardbl∞,(10)
whereρ∗,Ad, and∆i
ηare given in Lemma 2.
In order to prove our main results in Theorem 1, we need
to ﬁrst take two intermediate steps on i) providing closed
form expressions for the observer errors and their upper
bounds, and ii) ensuring the existence of stabilizing gains ,
stated via Lemmas 2 and 3, respectively. To begin, we notethat equations (5)-(8) result in a switched linear system, with
the following set of possible switching signals:

which encodes all possible permutations of the operation (6 ).
Lemma 2 (Error Bounds) .For allB∈M , the errors of the
DSISO observer (5)–(8)are upper bounded as follows:

ρ(B∗Ax)<1. Consequently, the DSISO algorithm is ISS.
Proof. It follows from combining [26, Theorems 1 &2]./squaresolid
We are ready to provide a proof for Theorem 1 as follows.
Proof of Theorem 1. By Lemma 3, Assumption 2 implies the
existence of gains that render the DSISO algorithm ISS. It
remains to show that the solutions of (9) are stabilizing. Fi rst,
notice that Algorithm 2 computes Jiby solving (14). The use
ofJiin the constraints of (9) guarantees that the optimization
problem is feasible. Furthermore, we can show that since
Assumption 2 holds, there exists B∗such that ρ(B∗Ax)<1,
and therefore that the DSISO algorithm is ISS. We refer the
reader to [26, Theorem 2] for the construction of B∗. This in
combination with Lemmas 2 and 3 ensures that the bounds
in (11) converge to their steady state values in (10). /squaresolid

V. S IMULATION
In this section we demonstrate the DSISO algorithm on
an IEEE 14-bus system [30]. We refer the reader to [8] for
the derivation of the LTI representation of the system, whic h
can be discretized and written in the form of (1). The n=
10dimensional state x⊤
k=/bracketleftbig
δ⊤
kω⊤
k/bracketrightbig⊤represents the rotor
angle and frequency of each of the 5 generators. Each bus
in the test case corresponds to a node in the algorithm. The
noise signals satisfy /bardblwk/bardbl∞<5and/bardblvi
k/bardbl<1×10−4
∀i∈V. Similarly to the example in [8], each node (bus)
measures its own real power injection/consumption, the rea l
power ﬂow across all branches connected to the node, and for
generating nodes, the rotor angle of the associated generat or.
In this example, we assume that the generator at node
1 is insecure and potentially subject to attacks. Due to the
reduction necessary to eliminate the algebraic constraint s of
the power system model [8], the disturbance appears directl y
in the measurements of all nodes, resulting in nonzero Hi
matrices. We compute the gains LiandΓiby solving (9).
Figures 1 and 2 show the input and state framers, respec-
tively. It is clear that the algorithm is able to estimate the
statex1despite the disturbance with only minor performance
degradation. The switching due to (6), which depends on
the noise, is also evident. The estimation performance for
the other states is comparatively better, since they are onl y
affected by (known) bounded noise. Furthermore, all agents
are able to maintain an accurate estimate of the disturbance .
VI. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper introduced a novel distributed algorithm for
interval estimates of states and unknown inputs for LTI
systems with bounded noise, whose sensors and actuators
are compromised by false data injection attacks. Without
imposing any restrictive assumptions such as boundedness
or stochasticity on the unknown input (attack) signals, we
addressed the correctness of the proposed distributed ob-
server, and moreover, analyzed the stability of the observe r
by considering the switched linear dynamics of the resultin g
error system. Finally, we provided a tractable method for
computing stabilizing gains which aim to minimize the
steady state input and state error of the observer. Hence,Fig. 1: State upper (red) and lower (blue) framers from all agents
and the true state value (black) for selected states x1,x3, andx7
(left), as well as state error interval widths (right).

Blue and red denote lower and upper framers, respectively, a nd
black is the true signal.
our approach can serve the purpose of resilient estimation
in bounded-error networked cyber-physical systems. In the
future, we consider extending our approach to nonlinear and
hybrid systems, as well as including other type of adversari al
effects such as switching and network attacks in our setting .

This, in combination with (4c) and (4a) results in

whereEi=Mi

with the fact that Ti=I−ΓiCi

Plugging in Ci

k)to the right
hand side of (17), then collecting like terms, results in
xk+1=Aixk+Liηi
k+1+Ψiξi
k+1, (18)
By applying Proposition 1 to all the uncertain terms in the
right hand side of (18): xi
k≤xk≤xi
k⇒xi,0
k+1≤xk+1≤
xi,0
k+1, wherexi,0
k+1,xi,0
k+1are given in (5). This means that
individual framers/interval estimates are correct. When t he
framer condition is satisﬁed for all nodes, the intersectio n
of all the individual estimates of neighboring nodes (cf. (6 ))
also results in correct interval framers, i.e.
xi,0
k≤xk≤xi,0
k,∀i∈V=⇒xi
k≤xk≤xi
k,∀i∈V.
Furthermore, plugging di
1,kanddi
2,kfrom (15) and (16) into
(4d) and applying Proposition 1 returns the input framers in
(7), where their intersection is still a framer (cf. (8)) by t he
same reasoning as for the state framers. Since the initial st ate
framers are known to all i, by induction (5)-(8) constructs a
correct distributed interval state and input framer for (1) .
