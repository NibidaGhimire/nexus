Unexpectedly strong X-ray emission from extragalactic radio jets on 
kiloparsec scales has been one of the major discoveries of Chandra, the only X-ray observatory capable of sub-arcsecond-scale imaging. The origin of this X-ray emission, which appears as a second spectral component from that of the radio emission, has been debated for over two decades. The most commonly assumed mechanism is inverse-Compton upscattering of the cosmic microwave background by very low-energy electrons in a still highly relativistic jet. Under this mechanism, no variability in the X-ray emission is expected. Here we report the detection of X-ray variability in the large-scale jet population, using a novel statistical analysis of 53 jets with multiple Chandra observations. Taken as a population, we find that the distribution of P values from a Poisson model is strongly inconsistent with steady 
emission, with a global P value of 1.96 × 10
−4 under a Kolmogorov–Smirnov 
test against the expected uniform (0, 1) distribution. These results strongly imply that the dominant mechanism of X-ray production in kiloparsec-scale jets is synchrotron emission by a second population of electrons reaching multi-teraelectronvolt energies. X-ray variability on the timescale of months to a few years implies extremely small emitting volumes much smaller than the cross-section of the jet.
Enabled by its unrivalled spatial resolution, one of the major discoveries 
of the Chandra X-ray Observatory has been the detection of hundreds 
of resolved kiloparsec-scale jets from supermassive black holes1. Chan -
dra has discovered far more of these than initially thought likely, due 
to the fact that many show an anomalously high and hard X-ray flux 
from a second spectral component, which was previously unknown. 
Shortly after the first discovery of the X-ray jet in PKS 0637-7522,3, the 
inverse-Compton upscattering of the cosmic microwave background 
(IC/CMB) model was proposed to explain the unexpectedly high X-ray emission4,5, and until recently it was by far the preferred interpreta-
tion. The IC/CMB model requires that the jets remain highly relativistic 
on kiloparsec scales (bulk Lorentz factors Γ  ≈ 10), and also very well 
aligned to our line of sight. The relativistic particles in the jet una -
voidably inverse-Compton upscatter the microwave-energy cosmic 
microwave background (CMB) photons to higher energies, and with 
large Γ as well as a jet aligned at a small angle, the Doppler boosting of 
this emission can be extreme enough to explain the observed X-ray 
fluxes. In this scenario the electrons responsible for upscattering the Received: 17 May 2022

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-023-01983-1using a one-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test confirms the excess 
of low P  values, with a global KS P value for the comparison with U(0, 1) 
of 0.000196. This clearly indicates that the observations are not con-
sistent with a universal constant source rate for the entire popula -
tion. (To avoid confusion, we hereafter refer to the P values from the 
maximum-likelihood function for a single region as ‘single-region’  
P values, and the P  values associated with the KS test of the entire  
distribution of the latter as ‘global’ or ‘KS-test’ P values.)
The departure from a U(0, 1) distribution clearly indicates some 
amount of variability, but does not immediately yield constraints on the 
fraction of the sample that is variable (if less than unity) or the typical 
scale of the variability. It is theoretically possible for the population of 
X-ray emitting jets to be a mixture of variable and non-variable X-ray 
emitters, and some degeneracy to exist between the fraction of the 
sample that is intrinsically variable and the amplitude of that variability.
To better constrain the fraction of the sample displaying variability 
and its characteristic scale, we generated simulated data sets differing 
in these two respects, and then compared the resulting P -value distribu -
tions to look for those most like our real data. The simulated data were 
generated using the real average exposure values for our knot regions 
as well as their estimated mean count rates ̄μ. We used a simple model 
of variability, of two epochs with a fixed percentage variance relative 
to mean, and used a KS test to compare a simulated single-region 
P-value distribution (n  = 10,000) with our real distribution. The result -
ing global P  values from the KS-test comparisons are displayed in  
Fig. 2 as a two-dimensional colour map with axes of variability ampli-
tude (percentage relative to mean rate ̄μ) against the fraction of the 
sample that is variable versus steady. Lighter colours (indicating simu -
lation/data KS-test P  values closer to 1) show the simulations most 
resembling the data. While there is notable degeneracy between char -
acteristic amplitude and how much of the sample is variable, the data 
are best matched by simulations in which between 30 and 100% of the 
sample is variable.
Variability in the X-ray emission from large-scale jets on timescales 
of a few months to years is not compatible with the IC/CMB mechanism: 
the CMB is completely steady, and the electrons upscattering it are very 
low energy (Lorentz factor γ  ≈ 100–1,000), with extremely long cooling 
timescales, many orders of magnitude longer than the light-crossing 
time for the jet6,16. However, a synchrotron origin is compatible with 
short-timescale variability6, as the X-rays must be emitted by very ener -
getic multi-teraelectronvolt electrons, where the cooling timescale is 
accordingly much shorter. Combined with a very small emitting volume 
(of the order of light months), it is possible to produce the observed 
variability. We therefore suggest that this variability is strong evidence 
that the X-ray emission in most jets is more likely to be synchrotron 
radiation from a very high-energy electron population, which in turn 
implies lower power requirements17. It is notable that the required small 
volumes are, however, in conflict with the typical assumption of particle 
acceleration distributed throughout the jet cross-section18 and present 
a serious challenge to current theoretical models.
Our sample exhibits considerable variety in terms of jet and knot 
region characteristics such as jet orientation, length, redshift, knot 
distance from the central engine, spectral type of the host nucleus 
(broad or narrow/absent optical emission lines) and so on. The sample 
also covers several orders of magnitude in jet power (as proxied by 
the low-frequency radio luminosity). Because of the poor statistics at 
the individual-region level, very little can be learned from looking at 
individual jets or regions with low P value. Instead we adopt a popula-
tion approach to look for the influence of jet or region properties on 
variability. To test if any particular source characteristics were more 
associated with variability than others, we split the sample into two 
subsets and reran the one-sided KS test of the single-region P -value 
distribution against a U(0, 1) distribution for each subset. The results are summarized in Table 1, where we give the selected characteristic, 
the subsample definitions and size, and the resulting KS-test P values. CMB to X-ray frequencies are very low in energy. Because of the very 
long cooling lifetimes of such electrons and the absolute steadiness 
of the CMB, any observed variability in the X-rays is incompatible with 
the IC/CMB model.
Motivated by previous reports of month- and year-timescale vari -
ability in the X-ray jet of Pictor A6–8, we undertook an archival analysis 
of all multiple-observation kiloparsec-scale X-ray jets. Our analysis 
sample comprises nearly all known X-ray jets imaged more than once 
by the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) instru -
ment, a total of 53 sources. The average number of observations per 
source in our sample is 3.4, with a mean spacing of 2.6 yr. More than 
half (30) have been observed only twice, while a small number (6) have 
more than five distinct observations. We have excluded two sources  
(3C 305 and 3C 171) where the X-ray emission associated with the radio 
jet has been attributed to jet-driven gas9,10, as well as the two most 
deeply observed jets in the known population, M87 and Centaurus A. 
The X-ray emission in these latter sources is consistent with the falling 
tail of the radio-optical synchrotron spectrum11– 13. Both M87 and Cen A 
have been far more deeply and frequently observed than typical of the 
remaining sample (with 50 and 43 distinct observations, respectively), 
and this is probably one of the reasons that X-ray variability has been reported in both cases
6,7,14. With the exception of Pic A, variability has 
not been reported for any other source in our sample of 53. Previously, 
a knot in the jet of Pic A was seen to fade over a timescale of a few years6 
with a reported significance of 3.4σ , and potential low-level variability 
has been reported for the terminal hotspot7. Unlike the jets of M87 and 
Cen A, however, the X-ray emission in Pic A is clearly from a second 
emission component15, distinct from the radio-optical, and is thus 
retained in our sample.
For each X-ray jet, we produced a deep co-added X-ray image by 
aligning and stacking all available epochs. We obtained complimentary 
radio-wavelength images at matching or better resolution, predomi-nantly using archival data from the Very Large Array (Supplementary 
Table 1). We aligned and overlaid the radio and X-ray images of the jet to 
identify distinct compact zones of emission, referred to as knots (Fig. 1 ).  
At these scales, individual knots are causally independent (the mini-
mum knot-to-knot spacing among all jets is 650 light yr deprojected, 
and on average it is nearly 200,000 light yr). Our analysis assesses 
variability for individual knot regions rather than the entire extended jet due to the potential for independent and random variations along the jet to cancel out and reduce the statistical power of our test.
For each knot we define a consistent geometric area (knot region) 
to extract the total X-ray counts from each epoch, as depicted for the source PKS 1136-135 in Fig. 1. A corresponding larger region is used to 
estimate the counts from background emission. Further details of the 
data analysis and preparation are given in Methods and Supplementary 
Section 1, and a full description of the source and region properties and 
measurements are given in Supplementary Tables 2–5.
Our likelihood function is a straightforward application of Poisson 
statistics (Methods), with a null hypothesis of a steady source rate for 
each individual knot region, taking into account a varying background. 
For each knot, the observed source and background counts for all 
individual observations (epochs), along with the corresponding expo -
sure (in units of area × time) in the respective regions for that epoch, 
are the data. We compute for each knot a P value for the test of the null 
hypothesis of a steady source rate, and a maximum-likelihood estimate 
of the mean count rate for the knot, ̄μ. A low P  value means that the null 
hypothesis can be rejected in favour of an intrinsically variable source 
rate. Importantly, for a population of non-variable X-ray sources the 
single-region P values should follow a U(0, 1) distribution.
Using the traditional threshold of P  < 0.05 to reject the null hypoth -
esis, we find that 18 regions out of 155 tested are inconsistent with a 
steady source rate (compared with ~8 expected), and the distribution shows a notable excess at low P values (Extended Data Fig. 1). A com-
parison of the 155 single-region P  values with a U (0, 1) distribution Nature Astronomy
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-023-01983-1For subsets where the KS-test P value is lower than that of the full sam -
ple, the final column in these tables gives a percentage, which is the 
percentage probability of obtaining the lower KS-test P value purely 
by chance for a subselection of size n from the full parent population 
(that is, the percentile). A histogram depicting the P -value distribution 
for one of the split sample analyses is shown in Fig. 3 .
We interpret the combination of a lowered global P  value with 
a low percentile for one subset to mean that the compliment subset either contains more steady jets relative to the subset with a lowered 
global P value, or preferentially displays variability below our detec -
tion sensitivity for those regions, which varies due to factors such as 
the relative level of background radiation and intrinsic brightness. We 
found that 7 subselections (out of 12 in total) yield a sample with a lower 
KS-test P value than the full population, with percentiles ranging from 
0.21 to 10.14%. These cases are briefly discussed below, with additional 
discussion in Supplementary Section 1.

On the left we show the full results of all simulations, while on the right we show a filled contour plot corresponding to a subset of most probable parameters. 
While there is a degeneracy between the amplitude of variability and the variable fraction, the simulations imply that at least 30% of the population is variable  
and that the typical scale of the variability is of the order of 10% compared with  
the mean.Nature Astronomy
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-023-01983-1A lower KS-test P value is found for the subsample comprised of 
regions more than 5″ from the bright central core. This is consistent 
with expectations, as the simulation summarized in Fig. 2 as well as a 
simple histogram of the percentage variation from mean for all regions 
(Extended Data Fig. 2) strongly suggests that the typical variability level 
in the population is at the few to tens of per cent level (as opposed to 
large orders-of-magnitude flares). Variability at this level may not be 
detectable in some test regions due to shorter exposures, intrinsically 
low source flux, relatively high levels of background or any combination 
of these factors, which together set a lower limit on the amplitude of 
variability we can detect. We call this limit the sensitivity threshold, and 
for high-background regions (common for knots near the bright base 
of the jet or core) the sensitivity threshold may be well above the typical 
source variability amplitude, while this is less likely to be the case for 
regions with low background or encompassing relatively bright knots. 
A further discussion of the sensitivity threshold and its estimation is given in Supplementary Section 2.
In the remaining cases of subsets with a lower KS-test P value, the 
compliment subset (with a higher P value) consists of source popula-
tions where the likelihood of steady IC/CMB emission being enhanced 
or dominant is supported on theoretical grounds. For all such ‘excluded’ 
populations we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the population 
is non-variable in the X-rays. In particular, we find that higher-redshift 
jets are consistent with the steady-flux hypothesis, while removing 
them increases the indication of variability (via decreased global KS-test score) in the remaining low-redshift sample. Because the 
CMB energy density increases markedly with redshift as (1 + z)4, there 
has long been an expectation that the IC/CMB mechanism of X-ray production would increasingly dominate with redshift, leading to a strong  
correlation between X-ray/radio flux ratio and redshift in resolved  
jets19 and an enhancement in the total X-ray emission even for unre -
solved jets20. Until recently, the severe lack of high-redshift sources 
among the known X-ray jets (with only a handful above z ≈ 3) made it 
difficult to determine whether the lack of an observed correlation was a 
contradiction to this expectation or merely a reflection of wide scatter 
in the intrinsic X-ray/radio flux ratio and/or inadequate sampling21,22.  
In recent years, however, several very high-redshift (z  > 4) X-ray jets and 
jet candidates have been identified with high X-ray/radio flux ratios 
strongly suggesting an IC/CMB origin23–25. Studies of high-redshift 
quasars also show marked (>50%) total X-ray flux enhancements at 
high redshifts (z  > 3), which has been attributed to IC/CMB emission 
in unresolved large-scale jets20. Our results, alongside these recent 
discoveries, suggest a gradual change in the jet population, from 
synchrotron dominated at lower redshift, giving way to increasing  
IC/CMB dominance in the population at high redshift, presumably 
due to the enhancement of the CMB. While a small handful of jets at 
lower redshifts, under favourable conditions, may have X-ray emission 
produced by IC/CMB26, recent observations with the Fermi gamma-ray 
observatory also generally disfavour an IC/CMB origin for many low- to 
moderate-redshift jets27,28.
In addition to those at low redshift, we also find that low-power 
jets (300 MHz power, L300 MHz  < 10,643 erg s−1) are more discrepant from 
the U(0, 1) population (percentile 2.34%) than the full sample, while we 
cannot exclude the null hypothesis for the high-power sources. Because 
the IC/CMB X-ray model generally requires jets with highly relativistic  
(Γ ≈ 10) speeds on kiloparsec scales, a possible interpretation is that Table 1 | Results of the one-sided subsample KS tests against the U (0, 1) distribution, not adjusted for multiple comparison

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-023-01983-1IC/CMB X-rays are more often produced in powerful, highly collimated 
jets. This is in keeping with general observations that jets with an  
anomalous X-ray component are mostly hosted by powerful quasars, 
though a more careful statistical analysis with complete samples is needed  
to confirm this.
Two additional characteristics, the ‘jet class’ and orientation 
angle, give a subset with a much lower global KS-test P value than the 
full sample. Here the subpopulations that conversely appear con -
sistent with the steady-flux hypothesis are core-dominated quasars 
and (with notable overlap of ~90%) sources with a small estimated 
angle to the line of sight. This is consistent with theoretical expecta -
tions, as inverse-Compton emission is more sensitive to the increased  
Doppler boosting of the relativistic jet with decreasing angle to the 
line of sight29,30. When we make a double selection, excluding only  
the 47 high-redshift core-dominated quasars, the one-sided KS-test  
P value against a U (0, 1) distribution of the remaining sample decreases 
to 0.0000032, with a 0.21% probability of occurring by chance. Sources 
classed as core-dominated quasars are usually broad lined and are 
assumed to have jets oriented at small angles to the line of sight. Here 
the orientation angle appears to be the critical factor, since we find 
that a subselection of broad-lined sources from our sample shows 
these sources to have a similar ‘variability signal’ in terms of the global 
KS-test P value (9 × 10−5, with 10% possibility of being drawn by chance). 
A further discussion of the subsample analysis results and their inter-
pretation is contained in Supplementary Section 1.
In addition to the results presented here, two nearby and very well 
known X-ray jets have been extensively and deeply studied with the 
Chandra observatory, more so than any other jets. These are Cen A and 
M87. In comparison to our sample, these low-redshift jets have far more 
extensive and deeper observations, with 43 and 50 distinct observa -
tions totalling 1,129 and 460 ks of total time on source, respectively 
(the median total time for our sample is in comparison 63 ks). Previous 
works have already extensively described their characteristics, includ -
ing the unprecedented (and unrepeated) X-ray flare from knot HST-1 
in M87, where the X-ray flux increased by a factor of over 50 during the 
mid-2000s, before fading back to its previous level31. The variability in 
Cen A, by contrast, appears as a gradual dimming consistent with adi-
abatic expansion32. In terms of spectrum, the unusually deep observa -
tions of M87 and Cen A make it clear that the X-ray emission is from the high-energy falling tail of the radio synchrotron component, and the 
X-ray variability is thus consistent with this picture. Since we are mainly 
interested in testing the inverse-Compton scenario for jets in which 
the X-rays are or might be from a second emission component, we do 
not include these sources in our analysis. The one other jet previously 
reported as variable is Pic A. In contrast to M87 and Cen A, the X-ray 
emission is clearly from a distinct second spectral component15, and 
previous works have suggested variability in both the jet and hotspot6,7. 
In this work we confirm that Pic A is strongly variable and find that five 
of the nine regions in the jet, including the hotspot, are variable at the 
P < 0.05 level, and the mean of the absolute value of the percentage 
variation from ̄μ is 18%. The fact that all three of the most deeply 
observed X-ray jets show variability lends support to the 
population-based findings in this work.
For completeness and as a check of our methods, we also analysed 
the two X-ray jets previously excluded due to the X-ray emission being 
from surrounding gas (3C 305 and 3C 171). In these cases no variability is 
expected due to the scale of the X-ray emission. Indeed, in our analysis 
none of the regions give single-region P values less than 0.18 and thus all are consistent with a steady source rate.
The short timescales of X-ray variability observed in this and pre-
vious works implies that the emitting regions responsible are much 
smaller that the width of the jet. By the light-crossing-time argument a flare event on the order of a year cannot occur in a region larger than 
a few parsecs, vastly smaller than the typical resolved cross-section in 
the radio which is of the order of a kiloparsec or more. This requires 
extremely localized particle acceleration, more easily achieved through 
magnetic reconnection than through the usually assumed shock  
acceleration33. At present we lack a clear understanding of particle 
acceleration in extragalactic jets. Future theoretical work must take 
into account the requirements of short-timescale X-ray variability 
and the implied multi-teraelectronvolt-energy electrons produced on 
scales of hundreds of thousands of light years from the central engine.
Methods
Initial Chandra data analysis and imaging
The initial list of known X-ray jets was taken from the XJET online data-
base34 and from a search of the literature, a total of 199 jets. A com -
prehensive catalogue of known X-ray jets to date can be found in the 
recent ATLAS-X publication1. For the 55 multiply observed sources 
in our sample, we downloaded all available observations taken with  
Chandra’s ACIS35. Supplementary Table 2 lists the names and properties 
of the sample of 55 jets, and a complete list of the Chandra observations 
used can be found in Supplementary Table 3.
For the X-ray data analysis, we used CIAO36 4.12 and CALDB (https://
heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/caldb/caldb_intro.html) 4.9.2. 
Each observation was first reprocessed using the chandra_repro com -
mand. We applied a standard energy filter including only events from 
0.4–8 keV. Excluding all bright sources in the field of view, we extracted 
the background counts and used the lc_clean task to examine the data 
for background flares with a good time interval bin time of 259.28 s 
and cutting intervals with rates more than 2σ  from the mean count 
rate. The total exposure times before and after filtering are given in 
Supplementary Table 3.
We used these filtered data to produce initial subpixel images 
centred on the core of the X-ray jet for each observation, downsiz -
ing by a factor of 5 (a pixel scale of 0.0984″). We then co-added all 
epochs to make a deep subpixel image for comparison with the radio imaging and to identify knot regions. Before co-adding, we corrected 
for pointing offsets by aligning the point-source-like jet core in all 
exposures. To do so we manually calculated the offsets between the 
earliest available observation and all subsequent observations using 
the centroid task in CIAO. Using these offsets, we corrected the aspect 
solution and reprojected all observations to match the reference epoch. 
We then repeated our filtering and subpixel binning process on the

cannot be merged using CIAO’s dmmerge command, we used a Python 
script to manually sum all the counts for each subpixel in the matched 
two-dimensional image frame.
Radio observations
Where possible, we utilized radio imaging of resolution comparable to 
that of Chandra (0.2−0.7″). Most radio images (32) were newly reduced 
for this work from archival Very Large Array, Atacama Large Millimeter/  
Sub-Millimeter Array (ALMA) or Australia Telescope Compact Array 
observations (26, 3 and 3 sources, respectively). For these we followed 
a standard procedure of calibrating the visibilities using the Common 
Astronomy Software Applications37 software before deconvolving 
the image using the Common Astronomy Software Applications task 
clean with a Briggs (weighting) parameter of 0.5. Several rounds of 
self-calibration were generally used to improve the image quality. 
For the remaining 22 sources we used pre-existing publicly available 
radio images from the NASA Extragalactic Database (https://ned.ipac.
caltech.edu/) (4 sources), the XJET catalogue (5 sources) or the National 
Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array Archive Survey  
(13 sources). A complete table of the radio observations used can be 
found in Supplementary Table 1. Contour lines (showing levels of 
emission) corresponding to the radio imaging were overlaid on our 
co-added X-ray image as shown in Fig. 1, and we identified all distinct 
knots and hotspots for analysis. We ignored radio knots that were 
within and visually indistinguishable from the X-ray core and those 
that had no visible X-ray emission. We note that, while it is now well 
established that radio and X-ray knots do not always perfectly coincide1, 
the inferred offsets from radio to X-ray are small, with most being <0.2″. 
This is smaller than the Chandra/ACIS pixel scale and much smaller 
than our region sizes.
X-ray spectral analysis and measurement
We defined polygon regions for each knot or hotspot, being careful 
to avoid overlap and to encompass fully each individual emission 
region. For knots close to the bright central X-ray core, we used an 
annulus region to define simultaneously the knot (a slice of the annulus 
centred on the core) and its matched background (the remainder of 
the annulus). This is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1 for source PKS 
1928+738. In cases where a readout streak was present, this was excised 
proportionately from the annulus background. For knots and hotspots 
far from the core, a simple polygon encompassing the feature was 
used to extract the source counts, and a large representative region 
far from any source was used to estimate the background. For the 155 
total jet features analysed, 93 are annulus-type regions. For jets with 
more than one knot region, we also defined a region encompassing the 
entire jet for spectral analysis. For each observation, we extracted the 
counts using the CIAO specextract command from every region and 
its associated background, including the total jet region.
To estimate the total jet spectral index we used sherpa to fit the 
counts extracted from the total jet region with an absorbed power-law 
model using the galactic hydrogen column density (nH) values from 
the HI4PI survey38. In the common cases of relatively low background, 
it was simply subtracted. For annulus-type regions we used a second 
absorbed power law to model the background (dominated by the 
core). In a few cases, a thermal component in the background model 
was required to improve the spectral fit. These details are noted in 
Supplementary Table 1.
The total photon counts (per epoch) in our knot regions ranged 
from 1 to 2,156, with a median value of 38. In most cases, the photon 
statistics for individual knots are too low to allow us to effectively 
constrain the X-ray spectral index (Γx) for that region alone.We attempted a spectral fit for each of the 155 regions in our sample 
using sherpa. Of the 52 sources in our sample, 11 sources have a single 
knot region of interest and thus no distinction between the spectral 
fit of the knot and the overall jet. The remaining 41 sources each have 
knot regions of interest within the jet, totalling up to 144 regions. In 
these cases, we compared the spectral fits we obtained from fitting 
the emission from all the knots together (a ‘total jet’ region) with the 
spectral fits for each individual knot. Of these, we find that the total jet 
Γx is within 1σ of the knot value of Γx for 110 regions and is within 2σ for 
21 regions. The remaining 13 knot regions either have poor spectral fits 
(reduced χ2 > 1) or do not have enough counts for the fit to converge. 
Given this situation, we used the Γx value from the fit to the entire jet 
region when generating the exposure maps for each source. We also 
note here the results of separate combined spectral fits to the total jet 
spectrum of the 13 ‘variable’ and 40 ‘steady’ jets, as determined by any 
region in the jet having single-region P  < or > 0.05, respectively. We find 
only a slight difference in photon index between the two samples, with 
the steady sources having Γx = 1.86 ± 0.03 and variable sources having 
Γx = 1.94 ± 0.03.
We used the values of Γx in the CIAO task make_instmap_weights to 
create a weights file for each observing epoch over our energy range 
of 0.4–8 keV. We then used the fluximage command to generate expo -
sure maps. We used a Python script to extract the raw counts and total 
exposures from our previously generated reprojected image and expo -
sure map, respectively, for both the knot region and its associated  
background at every epoch.
Recent work has shown that X-ray emission from jet knots is unre -
solved in Chandra observations, and we accordingly treat them as point 
sources1. Since the source regions are generally small (of the order of 
arcseconds), the measured number of photons from the source will be 
less than the total falling on the detector due to the limited size of the region. The encircled count fraction is simply the ratio of the counts 
falling within the finite region compared with the total over the full 
detector. While the encircled count fraction is generally similar across 
epochs, it does have slightly different values due to changes in the PSF 
and/or changes in the detector position of the feature. We have thus 
used simulated PSFs from the ATLAS-X catalogue of X-ray jets and our 
region files to measure the encircled count fraction in each epoch. 
These values are tabulated in Supplementary Table 5.
Statistical analysis method
Let (xi,yi), i = 1, …, n , be the background and source measurements, 
respectively, for a given knot, where i  iterates over all exposures 
(epochs) and (ai, bi) are the exposures (as measured in time multiplied 
by area) for the background and source measurements, respectively. In addition, the source region will have an associated encircled count 
fraction fi. The encircled count fraction and exposures are assumed to 
have negligible measurement error. Consider the following joint model 
for the observations xi and yi:
xi≈Poisson(aiβi),yi≈Poisson(biβi+bifiμi), (1)
where βi is the rate of background activity and μi is the rate of the source 
radiation for the ith observation. We are interesting in testing the null hypothesis H
0: μ1 = ⋯ = μn, the hypothesis that the source rates do not 
vary. The log-likelihood function is
l(μ,β;X,Y)=n
∑
i=1{xilog(aiβi)−aiβi+yilog(biβi+bifiμi)−biβi−bifiμi},
(2)
where μ, β, X, Y are the vectorized versions of the parameters and 
observations.
In this section, we provide a brief discussion of the theoretical 
details, as well as the definitions of the necessary components for Nature Astronomy
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-023-01983-1the construction of the directional test statistic used here, which has 
been found to be highly accurate in the small-sample setting. The full 
definitions and a thorough discussion of the theoretical details can 
be found in a previous publication39, in which several experiments 
demonstrate the numerical accuracy of this method with small sam -
ple sizes. Following the general notation in ref. 39 , we denote the ini -
tial parameterization by θ  = (ψ , λ) where ψ  is a d -vector parameter 
of interest and λ  denotes a (p  − d )-vector of nuisance parameters. In 
this model, the number of parameters increases with the number of 
observations as each knot requires its own source and background 
rate; thus, some of the expected asymptotic behaviour of the usual 
statistical tests may be violated. For example, we observe that the differ -
ences between competing statistical tests may not converge to 0 on the 
P-value scale, further reinforcing the need for an accurate small-sample  
approximation.
The P value is obtained through a three-step procedure. First 
we reduce the dimension of the data to the number of parameters,  
p. The second step is to then further reduce the dimension to the 
number of parameters of interest, d . The third step is to then con -
struct a one-dimensional conditional density, conditional on the 
direction of departure indicated by the observed data. The P  value 
is obtained by integrating this conditional density over the relevant  
region.
The first step is accomplished by constructing a tangent exponen -
tial model from the original model through pivotal quantities whose distributions are known
40. This results in a density of the form
fTEM(s;ϕ)=exp[l{ϕ(θ)}Ts(Y)+l0{θ(ϕ)}]g(s), (3)
where l0{θ(ϕ)} is the original likelihood function of the model, s  is a 
constructed sufficient statistic, and ϕ  is the new canonical parameteri -
zation in the tangent exponential family. A saddlepoint approximation 
is then used to approximate the density of this tangent exponential 
model, resulting in
fTEM(s;ϕ)=exp(k/n)
(2π)p/2exp[l(ϕ; s)−l(̂ϕ(s);s)]|Jϕϕ{̂ϕ(s)}|−1/2,(4)
where exp(k/n) is the normalizing constant, l(ϕ, s) is the likelihood of 
the tangent exponential model ( 3)
l(ϕ;s)=ϕ(θ)Ts+l0{θ(ϕ)}, (5)
and Jϕϕ is the observed information matrix under the canonical  
parameterization of the tangent exponential family.
The second step is carried out by restricting the approximation 
to the plane defined by the constrained maximum-likelihood estimate 
L0
ψ={s∶̂λψ=̂λ0ψ}, where ̂λ0
ψ is the constrained maximum-likelihood 
estimate.
The saddlepoint approximation to the density for this reduced 
model is
h(s;ψ)=exp(k′/n)
2πd/n
exp{l(̂ϕψ;s)−l(̂ϕ;s)}|̂ȷϕϕ|−1/2|̃ȷ(λλ)|1/2,s∈L0
ψ,(6)
where
|̂ȷϕϕ|=|||−∂2l(ϕ;s)
∂ϕ∂ϕ⊤|||̂ϕ(s)(7)
and ̃ȷ(λλ) denotes the observed information matrix for the nuisance 
parameters, calibrated to the ϕ parameterization:
|̃ȷ(λλ)|=|jλλ(̂ϕψ;s)|||∂ϕ(θ)
∂λ||−2
̂θψ, (8)where ̂θψ is the constrained maximum-likelihood estimate under the 
θ parameterization and ̂ϕψ is the constrained maximum likelihood 
under the ϕ  parameterization. For the third step, following the proce -
dure outlined in ref. 41 , the one-dimensional density of ∥ s∥ conditional 
on the direction s/∥s∥ gives the P value as the ratio of integrals
P(ψ)=∫tmax
1td−1h{s(t);ψ}dt
∫tmax
0td−1h{s(t);ψ}dt, (9)
where s(t) = (1 − t)s indexes points along the line, tmax is the maximum 
value of t  for which the constrained maximum-likelihood estimate 
exists and td−1 is the Jacobian of the transformation from s to (∥s∥, s/∥s∥). 
For more details, please see ref. 41 .
Now we specialize the above discussion to the Poisson model 
used here. The parameters of interest are ψi = μi+1 − μi for i = 1, …, n − 1, 
and the nuisance parameters are μ1, β1, …, βn. The null hypothesis is H0: 
ψ1 = ⋯ = ψn−1 = 0. The unconstrained maximum-likelihood estimators 
(MLEs) for μi and βi are
̂βi=xi
ai,̂μi=yi
fibi−̂βi
fi,i=1,…,n. (10)
The constrained MLEs under H0, (̂μ0,̂β0,1,…,̂β0,n), are obtained by 
numerically maximizing
l(μ⋆,β;X,Y)=n
∑
i=1{xilog(aiβi)−aiβi+yilog(biβi+fibiμ⋆)−biβi−fibiμ⋆},
(11)
where μ⋆ is scalar.
The tangent exponential family approximation to the likelihood 
along the line s(t) is
l{ϕ(θ);s(t)} =
n
∑
i=1[−(1−t)ϕi{xi−aiexp(̂ϕ0,i)}−(1−t)ϕn+i{yi−biexp(̂ϕ0,n+i)}
+xi{log(ai)+ϕi}−aiexp(ϕi)+yi{log(bi)+ϕn+i}−biexp(ϕn+i)],(12)
where ϕ are the canonical parameters in the Poisson model:
ϕ(μ,β)={log(βi)fori=1,…,n,
log(fi−nμi−n+βi−n)fori=n+1,…,2n.(13)
The line s (t) linking the score at the MLE ( ̂ϕ) and the score at the  
constrained MLE under the null hypothesis ( ̂ϕ0) is
s(t)={−(1−t)(xi−aiexp(̂ϕ0,i))fori=1,…,n
−(1−t)(yi−n−bi−nexp(̂ϕ0,i))fori=n+1,…,2n.(14)
The P value for testing H0 on the basis of observations (X , Y) is obtained 
from the following ratio of integrals:
∫tmax
1h{s(t);ψ}dt
∫tmax
0h{s(t);ψ}dt, (15)
where
h0(s(t)) =cexp{l(̂ϕ0;s(t))−l(̂ϕ(s(t));s(t))}|̂ȷϕϕ|−1/2|̃ȷ(λλ)|1/2.(16)
In the original parameterization, the MLEs for the tangent  
exponential family approximation, given in equation (12), for a value 
of s = s(t), are
̂βi(t)=txi/ai+(1−t)̂β0,i, (17)Nature Astronomy
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-023-01983-1̂μi(t)=tyi/fibi+(1−t)(̂β0,i+fîμ0,i)/fi−̂βi(t)/fi. (18)
As these estimates need to be positive, the maximum value that t can 
take is
tmax=min[min
i∈D1{fîμ0,i
fîμ0,i−yi/bi+xi/ai},min
j∈D2{̂β0,j
̂β0,j−xj/aj}],(19)
where D1∶= {i∈(1,…,n)∶̂μ0,ifi−yi/bi+xi/ai>0} and D2∶={j∈(1,…,n)
∶̂β0,j−xj/aj>0} .
Finally, the information terms are given by
|̂ȷϕϕ|=n
∏
i=1aibîβi(t)(fîμi(t)+̂βi(t)), (20)
|̃ȷλλ|=f2
1{ty1+(1−t)b 1(̂β0,1+fîμ0,1)

̂β2
0,i},(21)
where ̂βi(t) and ̂μi(t) are defined in equations (17 ) and (18). The P value 
is obtained by numerically integrating the numerator and denominator 
of equation (15 ). In our simulation studies, we observe that the test is 
accurate for n  ≤ 16; however, beyond this point the test begins to be 
anticonservative under the null.
We provide some numerical simulations in Supplementary  
Figs. 2–4 to show that the method works well under the null for the 
observed configurations. We include simulations with n = 2, 6 and 12, 
with configurations described in the figure captions. We observe that 
the uniformity of the P values is maintained.
