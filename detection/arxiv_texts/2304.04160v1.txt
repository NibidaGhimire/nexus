Abstract  
In this paper , we study the nonlinear optical bistability  (OB)  in a symmetrical  
multilayer structure. This structure is constructed by e mbedding a nonlinear 
three -dimensional  Dirac semi metal  (3D DSM)  into a solution filled one -dimensional 
photonic crystal Fabry -Perot  cavity. OB stems from the third order nonlinear 
conductivity  of 3D DSM and the local field of resonance mode could enhance the 
nonlinearity and reduce the thresholds of OB.  This structure achieves the tunability of 
OB due to that the transmittance could be modulated by the Fermi energy.  OB 
threshold and threshold width could be remarkably reduced by increasing the Fermi 
energy.  Besides, it is found  that the OB curve depends heavily on the angle of 
incidence of the incoming light, the structural parameters of  the Fabry -Perot  cavity , 
and the position  of 3D DSM inside the cavity.  After parameter optimization, we 
obtained OB with a threshold of 
610 V m . We believe this simple structure provides 
a reference idea for realizing low threshold and tunable all optical switching devices . 
Keywords: Optical bistability , Dirac semimetal , Fabry -Perot cavity.  1. Introduction  
Optical bistability  (OB) is a typical nonlinear optical phenomenon, which refers to 
the nonlinear phenomenon where an input light intensity corresponds to two output 
light intensities that can be converted into each other within a certain range , and at 
this time, there is a hysteresis loop similar to the “S” shape between the input and 
output light intensities [1,2]. Due to the nonlinear characteristics similar to the 
hysteresis curve, OB has been widely used in fields such as optical communication 
and photonic computing, suc h as biosensors [3], all -optical switching [4], optical 
transistors [5], and optical memories [6]. Currently, the main goal of studying OB is 
to reduce the threshold of OB to achieve practical OB devices. Generally, researchers ’ 
methods to reduce OB thresh old can be classified  as two categories  in rough : the first 
category is to take advantage of  resonant structures such as photonic crystal 
micro -cavities [7,8], Fabry -Perot  (FP) cavities [9,10], fiber bragg grating cavities 
[11,12], and surface plasmon reso nance [13 -15] to lower the OB threshold by 
enhancing the localized field enhancement effect; the second category is to use 
nonlinear materials with high nonlinear coefficients and add them to micro -nano 
structures to enhance the nonlinear effect of the sys tem and achieve the goal of 
reducing OB threshold. For example, micro -ring resonators based on cubic silicon 
carbide and photonic circuits based on sulfide glass have been reported [16,17].  In 
addition, studies have shown that graphene has superior optoelectronic properties and 
can fully utilize its advantages in the field of OB, with its most prominent feature 
being a huge nonlinear coefficient. Furthermore, graphene has characteristics such as  tunable conductivity and ultra -fast modulation speed, making it a favorite of 
researchers [18,19]. Currently, researchers are eagerly reporting on the method of 
reducing the threshold of OB by adding graphene to composite structures [20 -22]. 
Recently, peo ple have turned their attention to another type of topological material 
based on graphene, the three -dimensional Dirac semimetal (3D DSM). 3D DSM is a 
bulk medium and its volume electrons form a three -dimensional  Dirac cone, which is 
also known as “three -dimensional graphene ”. Although 3D DSM is called 
“three -dimensional graphene ”, unlike the two -dimensional Dirac fermions on the 
surface of graphene, 3D DSM has three -dimensional Dirac fermions in the volume. 
The unique electronic structure of 3D DSM gives i t many peculiar properties. 
Previous reports have shown that 3D DSM not only has similar properties to graphene 
in controlling the dielectric constant by adjusting the Fermi energy  but also exhibits 
high electron mobility  [23], good stability, strong coupl ing with light, and the ability 
to avoid the huge metal losses that occur in traditional metal metamaterials [24]. It is 
worth noting that the nonlinear refractive index coefficient of 3D DSM in the 
terahertz range is relatively high [25], so significant OB can be observed at lower 
incident electric field ranges. Based on these advantages, 3D DSM material stands out 
as a candidate material for constructing nonlinear optical devices in the field of OB, 
providing a new perspective for designing flexible and c ontrollable nonlinear OB 
devices.  
As is well known, the simplest device for implementing OB is the FP cavity 
structure, which can create the conditions necessary for the occurrence of OB by filling the cavity with a nonlinear medium. By increasing the inte nsity of the incident 
light, the refractive index of the nonlinear medium in the FP cavity changes, resulting 
in a bistable relationship between input and output light intensities.  Traditionally, the 
FP cavity consists of two mirrors, but with the developm ent of one -dimensional 
photonic crystal (1D PC), researchers have found that the photonic band gaps and 
localization properties of 1D PC have potential applications in the field of OB. 
Therefore, the use of two 1D PCs instead of two mirrors in the traditio nal FP cavity to 
achieve OB has attracted widespread attention.  Currently, many optical devices based 
on photonic crystal FP cavity structures have been reported, such as optical absorption, 
optical filters, and nonlinear effects. Therefore, we imagine wha t changes would 
occur in the cavity if we use two 1D PCs instead of the two mirrors in the FP cavity 
and fill the cavity with 3DDSM. Will hysteresis phenomenon still occur in such a new 
FP cavity? And what impact will 3D DSM have on hysteresis phenomenon? Based on 
this, we theoretically propose a photonic crystal FP cavity based on 3D DSM, which 
is placed at the center of the FP cavity.  We found that 3D DSM can provide strong 
nonlinear effects for the structure, and the unique band structure of 1D PC can 
increase the flexibility of controlling OB  with effect . Moreover , the threshold and 
hysteresis width of OB can be regulated  by tuning parameters such as the Fermi 
energy  of 3D DSM, incident angle, relaxation time, period of 1D PC, length of FP 
cavity, and position of 3D DSM in the cavity. Therefore, we believe that the photonic 
crystal FP cavity structure based on 3D DSM has broad potential applications in the 
field of nonlinear terahertz devices and nanophotonics, providing a reference for achiev ing low -threshold and tunable OB.  
2. Theoretical Model and Method  
 
Fig.1 Schematic diagram of a photonic crystal FP cavity based on a 3D DSM.  
It is considered to use a FP cavity composed of two symmetric photonic crystals, 
filled with 3D DSM  and water solution. As shown in Fig. 1, the 3D DSM is placed in 
the middle of the cavity, and the medium C placed on both sides of the 3D DSM is a 
water sol ution with a refractive index of 
1.33cn=  and a thickness of 
cd . The 
photonic crystal is composed of dielectric materials A and B with a cycle  of 
4m= , 
where the refractive index of dielectric  material A is 
1.5an= , and dielectric material 
B is glass with a refractive index of 
2.3bn=  [29,30]. The thicknesses of A and B are 
ad
 and 
bd , respectively. The central wavelength is set to 
300μmc= , and the 
length of the FP cavity is set to 
150μm L= . The thickness of dielectric material A 
and B is set to 
,, 4a b c a bdn= , and the thickness of mediu m C is also set to 
4c c cdn=
. The initial parameters of 3D DSM are set to 
1 eVFE= , 
0.2 ps= , and 
40 nmDd=
. The direction perpendicular to the photonic crystal is set as the z 
direction, and the incident electromagnetic wave is assumed to be TE polarization. It 
should be noted that the technology for preparing such multilayer dielectric structures 
is relativel y mature, and because the 3D DSM is a bulk medium, the technical 
difficulty in manufacturing is reduced. Overall, it is feasible to apply the structure 
proposed in this paper in practice.  
Ignoring the effects of external magnetic fields and random phase ap proximation, 
we can use the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation with relaxation time 
approximation to calculate the 3D DSM linear intraband  optical conductivity in the  
terahertz range , as expressed in equation (1) [31]:

therefore, we can write the third -order polarization of the 3D DSM as the following

from the above expressions, it can be found that the third -order polarizability

3D DSM is  bound up with  the linear in -band optical conductivity

tunable low -threshold OB.  
The reflection -transmission relationship of the entire construction  is estimated  
making use of  the transfer matrix method. As shown in Fig . 1, we set the light beam to 
propagate along the z -axis, with the 3D DSM parallel to the x -axis, and the 3D DSM 
placed at 
0z= . The transmission matrix of the photonic crystal and the trans mission

by adjusting the parameters.  
3. Results and Discussions  
In this section, we first talk over  the relevance  between the transmitted electric 
field 
tE  and the incident electric field  
iE under various  Fermi energ ies in 3D DSM, 
while keeping the other values  keep up  with those mentioned in Fig. 1. The key factor 
in realizing OB in this study is the large nonlinear conductivity of Dirac semimetals. 
Specifically, when we fill 3D DSM into the FP cavity, we observe a significant  change 
in the relevance  curve between 
tE  and 
iE , resulting in a hysteresis loop in the 
transmission curve. This is because the conditions required to achieve OB become 
easier to satisfy when the 3D DSM are filled into the F P cavity. From Fig. 2(a), we 
can see that when 
iE  is sma ll, the transmitted electric field  
tE gradually raises  with 
the incident electric field  
iE until a specific value, at which point the transmitted 
electric field  
tE undergoes a jump. However, when 
iE  is large, 
tE  gradually 
decreases with 
iE  up to  a specific value, at which point 
tE  undergoes a jump. In 
the case of the double stable curve at 
=0.8eVFE  in the figure, when 
iE  gradually 
increases from a small value to 
72 10 V miE= , the transmitted electric field  
tE 
undergoes an upward mutation, and the value of 
71 10 V miE=  at this point is 
called the upper threshold field of the switch. However, when the incident electric 
field 
iE gradually decreases fr om a large value to 
71 10 V miE= , the transmitted

tE  on 
iE  for different Fermi energy

electric field
tE  undergoes a downward mutation, and the value of 
71 10 V midownE=
 at this point is called the lower threshold field of the switch. In 
addition, the hysteresis width is denoted as 
71 10 V mi i i up downE E E = − =  . 
Moreover, from Fig. 2(a), we can also observe that as the Fermi energy  
FE of the 
3D DSM in creases, both the upper and lower threshold fields of the OB (
iupE  and 
downiE
) raise , and they move to higher light intensity ranges to the right. We describe 
this phenomenon in detail in Fig. 2(b). As shown in the  figure, as 
FE  of the 3D DSM 
increases, the hysteresis loop between 
tE  and 
iE  gradually increases, and its 
hysteresis width also significantly widens because the speed of the upper threshold 
field of the OB moving to the right is much faster than that of the lower threshold 
field of the OB. Additionally, we can find that although r educing 
FE  of the 3D DSM 
is advantageous for lowering the OB threshold, when the Fermi energy  
FE  
decreases to a certain extent, the hysteresis width disappears, and the OB curve 
vanishes  as well. In summary, the discovery of the above laws is beneficial for us to 
regulate  the OB threshold and hysteresis width by adjusting 
FE  of the 3D DSM, 
providing a pathway for people to regulate the OB phenomenon through external 
electric field control.  
Next, we will discuss the impact of incident angle variations on the OB curve . We 
set the Fermi energy  as 
1 eVFE= , and other values  keep up  with Fig . 1. As 
illustrated  in Fig . 3, the threshold size and hysteresis width of the OB change with the 
incident angle, indicating that the OB phenomenon is highly sensitive to the incident 
angle, which follows a similar pattern  to the discussion on the 3D DSM Fermi energy
FE
 in the previous section. As shown in Fig . 3(a), increasing the incident angle of the 
structure causes the transmittance curve to shift towards higher light intensities, and 
the hystere sis width gradually increases with increasing incident angle. Meanwhile, 
the dependence of  
tE on 
iE also exhibits a similar variation  tendency , the above 
rule is reflected in Fig. 3(b) . We take 
=5  and 
=10  as examples to analyze the 
changing pattern in detail: when 
=5 , 
62.98 10 V miupE= ,
56.60 10 V midownE=
, the hysteresis width 
62.32 10 V miE =  ; when 
10=
, 
64.34 10 V miupE= ,
68.05 10 V midownE= , the hysteresis width is 
53.54 10 V miE = 
. These calculated results confirm the above pattern well. In 
addition, as shown in the OB line at 
0=  in Fig . 3(b), although the hysteresis 
width gradually narrows with decreasing incident angle, even when the incident angle 
decreases to 
0 , there is still a hysteresis width in the relevance  curve between 
tE  
and 
iE . Therefore, it can be proved that the method of using the 3D DSM -based photonic crystal F P cavity to achieve low -threshold and tunable OB can also be

tE  and
iE
. 
implemented under vertical incidence conditions without requiring specific incident 
angles. Compared to certain traditional methods of achieving low -threshold OB, this 
method has more advantages and is easier to implement.  
Furthermore, we investigate the influence of relaxation time and photonic crystal 
period variations on the OB phenomenon while keeping other relevant values remain 
unchanged . On the one hand, we observe that the change in the relevance  between 
tE
 and 
iE  exhibits the same trends as those seen in the OB threshold and hysteresis 
width for different relaxation times. In the wake of  
 decreases, the OB threshold 
also decreases. However, as 
iupE  and 
idownE  both gradually increase, but 
idownE  
increases faster than 
iupE , the hysteresis width rapidly narrows. For instance, when 
0.4 ps=
, 
74.02 10 V miupE= , 
61 10 V midownE= , the hysteresis width is 
73.92 10 V miE = 
, and when 
0.2 ps= , 
61.78 10  V miupE= ，
56.11 10 V midownE=
, it is 
61.17 10  V miE =  . Simulation results reveal that 
the OB curve  vanishes  when the relaxation time expends  to 
0.1 ps= . Therefore,  
 
Fig.4 The relationship between 
tE  and 
iE  at (a) different relaxation times and (b) different 
photonic crystal periods.  
while reducing the relaxation time can effectively lower the OB threshold, it cannot 
be reduced to an excessively low level, which will cause the OB phenomenon to 
disappear. On the other hand, we find that the impact of photonic crystal period 
variations on the OB phenomenon is highly similar to that of relaxation time. The OB 
threshold  decreases as the photonic crystal period decreases, and the hysteresis width 
between 
tE  and 
iE  narrows. Thus, careful consideration is required in choosing 
both the relaxation time and photonic crystal period to ensure optimal OB 
phenomenon production and the fabrication of more reasonable and practical OB 
devices.  
Regarding the relevance  between 
tE  and 
iE , we observed that the OB 
phenomenon is not only sensitive to the relaxation time, photonic crystal period, and 
3D DSM Fermi energy , but also to the cavity length of the FP cavity and the position 
of the 3D DSM layer in the cavity. Firstly, with the cavity length fixed at 
=150μm L , 
we studied the effect of the placement of the 3D DSM layer in the cavity on the OB

tE  and 
iE  for different 
positions of the 3D DSM layer in side the cavity . 
phenomenon. The position of the center point of the 3D DSM layer can be 
represented as 
=75μmDL . As shown in Fig . 5(a), as the position of the 3D DSM 
layer in the FP cavity changes, the resulting OB phenomenon also changes, with a 
corresponding change in the threshold size and hysteresis width, thus achieving 
flexible control of the OB phenomenon by adjusting the pos ition of the 3D DSM layer. 
Additionally, the cavity  length of the F P cavity should satisfy 
kL= , where the 
frequency is inversely proportional to the cavity length
L . Therefore, by adjusting the 
cavity length 
L , the OB phenomenon can be controlled. Fig . 5(b) shows the changes 
in the hysteresis curve after changing the cavity length. It can be observed that as the 
cavity length increases, the threshold size and hysteresis width of the OB 
phenomenon both increase significantly. Thus, we believe that the cavity length of the 
FP cavity can be an important means of controlling the OB phenomenon.  
4. Conclusions  
In conclusion, we have studied the OB phenomenon in a photonic crystal FP 
cavity based on 3D DSM. By utilizing the unique band structure of the photonic 
crystal, the resonant effect of the FP cavity, and the extraordinary  nonlinear properties 
of 3D DSM, we  have achieved low -threshold OB at terahertz frequencies, which can 
be flexibly controlled in terms of threshold size and hysteresis width. Our theoretical 
studies have shown that embedding 3D DSM in a F P cavity can significantly enhance 
the hysteresis beh avior. By adjusting parameters such as the Fermi energy  of the 3D 
DSM, the incident angle of the beam, the relaxation time, the cavity length of the FP 
cavity, and the position of the 3D DSM layer in the FP cavity, the OB phenomenon 
can be further controll ed. Through numerical simulations, we have found suitable 3D 
DSM and structural parameters and obtained an OB curve with a threshold of 
610 V m
. Our research provides new ideas for achieving tunable low -threshold OB at 
terahertz frequenc ies. We are firmly convinced  that the construction  came up with  in 
this article  for realizing OB is relatively simple and has advantages in the manufacture 
of practical OB devices, and has a n extensive  range of applications in the field of 
nonlinear optical devices.
