Experimental data obtained with the perovskite compounds Pr 0.55Sr0.45MnO 3show that the
magnetization decreases with increasing temperature Tand undergoes a very sharp phase transition
to the paramagnetic phase. The sharp transition in a system with a strong disorder is very rare,
if not non-existent, in the theory of phase transition in systems of short-range pairwise exchange
interactions. To understand this remarkable property, we introduce a model including a multispin
(cluster-like) interaction between Mn ions, in addition to the usual pairwise exchange terms between
these ions and the Mn-Pr interactions. We carry out Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using this model.
The crystal is a body-centered tetragonal lattice where the corner sites are occupied by Mn ions
and the center sites by Pr or Sr ions. Due to the doping, Mn4+with S= 3/2 has the concentration
of Pr3+(S= 1) and Mn3+with S= 2 has the Sr concentration. After attempts with different
spin models and various Hamiltonians, we find that the many-state Ising spin model reproduces
most of the experimental results. For the Hamiltonian, we find that pairwise interactions alone
between ions cannot reproduce the sharp transition and the magnetization below TC. We have to
include a multispin interaction as said above. We fit the MC results with experimental data, and we
estimate values of various exchange interactions in the system. These values are found to be in the
range of those found in perovskite manganite compounts. We also study the applied-field effect on
the magnetization in the temperature region below and above the transition temperature TC. We
calculate the magnetic entropy change |∆Sm|and the Relative Cooling Power, for magnetic field
from 1 to 3 Tesla. Our simulation results are in good agreement with experiments. The role of the
multispin interaction is analyzed and discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
Interest in seeking broad clean air protections and environmentally green technology to reduce production and
consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) has continued to grow over the last decades. Much ink has been spilled
on the topic of ‘’innovation new technology for cooling ‘’ in view to replace refrigerants with high global warming
potential (GWP). Among the most cooling technologies used today across the world, magnetic refrigeration can be
considered as a successfully solution that may offer larger efficiencies than a traditional refrigeration technique owing
its promissing characgteristics. This emergent technology could provide efficient heating and cooling, which accounts
for more than half of the energy used in homes, and help phase out conventional gas-compression refrigeration [1],
which use gases with high GWP as refrigerants. The magnetic refrigeration, based on magnetocaloric effect (MCE)
would eliminate the risk of such gases escaping into the atmosphere by replacing them with heating or cooling of
a magnetic material upon application or removal of magnetic field which makes it environmentally safe refrigerant
with zero GWP [2]. Therefore, materials with magnetocaloric properties are suitable for use in refrigeration and air
conditioning. Both a large, isothermal entropy change (∆ Sm) induced by a variation of the external magnetic field
[3] and adiabatic temperature change (∆ T) determine the large MCE for a magnetic material. As noted earlier,
the gadolinium (Gd) metal is mostly conspicuous magnetic refrigeration with a large MCE but has a drawback and
restriction for its use in the actual application because it has a high cost [4]. With the goal to innovate new substance
with low price and large MCE, a lot of research has been done on magnetic materials that offered the best magnetic
properties and cheaper than Gd. The rare-earth manganite perovskites with the general formula Ln 1−xAxMnO 3(Ln=

trivalent rare earth, A=divalent alkaline earth) are prospect candidates for electronic and/or magnetic devices due
to their large range of features such as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and MCE [5]. Recently, many studies on
Pr-based manganites have shown their striking properties including the charge ordering (CO) state, coexistence of
ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) phases, and metamagnetic transition [6-8]. Especially, the perovskite
Pr1−xSrxMnO 3is a great promise member in manganites family with intermediate one electron bandwidth [9].
More recently, Fan et al [10] have investigated experimental magnetic properties of perovskite manganite
Pr0.55Sr0.45MnO 3by using traditional solid-state reaction method. They reported that doping 45% of Sr in PrMnO 3
can lead to a sharp paramagnetic (PM) - FM phase transition at 291K, and indicate that the present material possesses
a large Relative Cooling Power (RCP) and a wide temperature range. These features raise Pr 0.55Sr0.45MnO 3to be a
perfect candidate for magnetic refrigeration in the room temperature range. Motivated by the experimental progress
of the MCE towards the doping of Pr with Sr, we use in this paper a modeling which contains various interaction
terms between different kinds of magnetic ions in the system. As will be shown below, the ”multi-state” Ising spin
model with different spin amplitudes according to the kind of ions [Mn3+:S= 2, Mn4+:S= 3/2, Pr3+:S= 1 ] is the
best to get an agreement with experimental data [10]. In addition to the nearest-neighbor (NN) pairwise interactions,
we have used also a multi-spin interaction between Mn ions. Using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, we show that this
term is the origin of the sharp phase transition between FM and AF phases occurring at TC= 291 K [10]. Our model
thus reproduces to a good agreement experimental measurements performed on this material: magnetization versus
T(temperature) and the magneto-caloric properties .
The paper is organized as follows: in section II, we describe our theoretical model and the MC method. Results
are compared to experimental data in section III. Our concluding remarks are given in section IV.
II. MODEL AND METHOD
A. Experimental samples
In this paper, we propose a theoretical model and carry out MC simulations based on that model. Our purpose is to
compare our MC results with experimental data obtained for Pr 0.55Sr0.45MnO 3[10]. Polycrystalline Pr 0.55Sr0.45MnO 3
sample was prepared by traditional solid-state reaction method. The structure and phase purity of the prepared sample
were verified by powder X-ray diffraction with Cu Ka radiation at room temperature.
We note that this compound of the same concentration has also been prepared by another method:the polycrystalline
sample of Pr 0.55Sr0.45MnO 3has been synthesized using nitrate route [11]. The authors have described the sample
preparation as follows: ”The stoichiometric ratio of powder Pr 6O11, SrCo 3and MnO 2were grounded and calcined
several times between 800◦C and 1200◦C for 24 h with intermediate grindings. The powders thus obtained were
pressed into pellet form at 10 MPa pressure and finally sintered at 1400◦C for 30 h. The structure and phase
formation were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern recorded at room temperature and was refined
by Rietveld method using FullProf Software program. The XRD pattern of the sample crystallized in an orthorhombic
structure with Pnma space group comprising lattice parameters a= 5.423(6) ˚A,b= 7.660(7) ˚A and c= 5.478(7) ˚A
with cell volume V= 227.632(1) ˚A3.
The two above samples with the same formula do not however yield the same experimental data: in Ref. [10] there
is only a transition from the paramagnetic (PM) phase to the ferromagnetic (FM) phase at TC= 291◦C, and this
phase persists to near T= 0. On the other hand, Ref. [11] finds that the PM-FM transition occurs at TC= 281◦C
and the FM phase is transformed into the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase at TC= 181◦C and this latter phase goes
down to near T= 0. Does the way of sample preparation yield this difference? We believe that this difference comes
from domains and dislocations which are certainly numerous in the sample of Ref. [11] causing two phase transitions.
There may be two types of domain, antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ones, in the sample of Ref. [11], and each
type of domain may have its own phase transition. To simplify the modeling, we choose to consider the experimental
data of Ref. [10] in this paper.
B. Model
For the modeling, we use the body-cencered tetragonal (bct) lattice where the c-axis has the longuest lattice constant
( 7.66 ˚A) and the other two axes have approximately the same lattice constant ( 5.45 ˚A). The corner sites of the
bct lattice are occupied either by Mn3+(S= 2) or Mn4+(S= 3/2) with their respective concentrations 0.55 and
0.45. The centered sites are occupied by either Pr3+ions ( S= 1) or by non magnetic ions Sr with their respective
concentrations 0.55 and 0.45. We generate a random mixing of Mn ions on the corner sites and Pr and Sr on the3
centered sites, respecting their respective concentrations. This is a strongly disordered system. An example of ion
distribution in a bct cell is shown in Fig. 1.
FIG. 1: A random ion distribution on the bct lattice: black, red and green circles represent Mn3+, Mn4+and Pr3+, respectively.
For the spin model, we shall use the ”multi-state” Ising model for all types of ion with different lengths S= 2 for
Mn3+,S= 3/2 for Mn4+, and S= 1 for Pr3+. Note that the two outer electrons of the Pr ion occupy the orbitals
4f2, so its spin is 1 (Hund’s rule), and L= 3 + 2 = 5. So, for less than half filled shell , J=|L−S|= 4. However,
as we are interested in spin-spin interactions of the compound which are responsible for the magnetic transition (not
J−Jinteraction), the orbitals Lare not taken into account. As for Mn3+and Mn4+, Mn3+and Mn4+have spins
2 and 3/2, respectively by looking at the electronic configurations of those ions : the outer electrons of these ions
occupy 3d4and 3d3, respectively. By the Hund’s rule, 3d4of Mn3yields S= 4×1/2 = 2, and 3d3of Mn4yields
S= 3×1/2 = 3 /2, with their respective concentrations 0.55 and 0.45.
Unlike the conventional Ising model with two spin states ±S, we shall use the multi-state Ising model: the spin S
has 2 S+ 1 states −S,−S+ 1, ..., S−1, S. This model is somewhat similar to a quantum spin model, except the fact
that it does not have xandycomponents, so it does not have quantum fluctuations. This multi-state Ising model
expresses a strong anisotropy along the c-axis, in addition to the difference of state numbers of Mn3+, Mn4+and Pr3+
. We will discuss about this choice in section IV.
Let us define the pairwise interactions between magnetic ions by
Hp=−X
<i,j>JijSi·Sj−µ0HX
<i>Si (1)
where Jijis the interaction strength between the spins SiandSjoccupied the sites iandj,Hdenotes the applied
magnetic field applied in the + z(c-axis) direction. We suppose only the interactions between nearest neighbors (NN)
in the three directions of the bct lattice. We denote these interactions as follows:
J1: Interaction coupling of a Mn3+ion with a NN Mn3+ion,
J2: Interaction coupling of a Mn3+ion with a NN Mn4+ion,
J3: Interaction coupling of a Mn4+ion with a NN Mn4+ion,
J4: Interaction coupling of a Pr ion with a Mn3+ion,
J5: Interaction coupling of a Pr ion with a Mn4+ion
J6: Interaction coupling between two Pr ions on the adjacent bct units.
Note that due to the longer lattice constant in the c-axis, we apply a reduction coefficient C= 0.5 on the interaction
between NN ions lying on the c-axis. A slight variation of Ccauses of course a small shift on the value of TCbut no
new physics is found.
The transition experimentally observed for our compound has a sharp first-order-like transition at TC. Our com-
pound has a very strong disorder with a 0.55-0.45 mixing of Mn ions and with 0.45 percents of centered sites without
spins. Such a strongly disordered system cannnot have a sharp phase transition as we see in spin glasses and amor-
phous magnetic materials. For the modeling, we have tried the Heisenberg model, the continuous Ising model, ...4
with various pairwise interactions, but we did not find the magnetization curve with a first-order-like transition ex-
perimentally observed. The idea to introduce the multispin interaction to reproduce the experimental observations,
as we will see later, was successful. After several trial forms, the following cluster-like interaction between NN spins
in the xyplane, in addition to the above pairwise interactions, is written by
Hm=−KX
iSiSi1Si2Si3Si4 (2)
where Kis the interaction strength and the sum runs over all Mn sites and the spins Si1, Si2, Si3andSi4are the
NN of the spins Sion the xyplane (see Fig. 2).
FIG. 2: Spin Si,of the Mn ion at the site iinteracts simultaneously with four Mn spins Si1,Si2,Si3andSi4in the xyplane.
The multi-spin interaction is given by Eq. (2). See text for comments.
The similar model has been used with success to describe the magnetization plateau at low Tand the magnetic
entropy change under an applied magnetic field in agrrement witrh experiments performed for the compound with
another doping concentration, namely Pr 0.9Sr0.1MnO 3[12]. However, for the strong doping as in Pr 0.55Sr0.45MnO 3
considered in this paper, we have to refine the spin model by using the multi-state Ising model, and to introduce
the so-called Creutz over-relaxation in the MC flipping procedure as descibed below. In doing so, we obtain a very
good agreement with experimental data. Note that magnetic properties strongly change with doping concentration.
A simple model cannot interpret results of different doping concentrations. A model refinement is necessary as shown
in this paper.
Let us discuss about the muti-spin interaction. The pairwise Ising model can be considered as the one-component
limit of the Hesenberg model. The pairwise Heisenberg model involves only two interacting spins because of the
initial assumption of the overlap between the spin-dependent wave functions of only two neighboring atoms. With the
Hartree-Fock approximation, we can derive the Heisenberg model commonly used in the literature (see for example
chapter 3 ”Magnetic Exchange Interaction” of Ref. [13]). In materials, however the interaction between one spin
with its neighbors is simultaneous, but the demonstration for the multi-spin interaction as in the case of two-body
Heisenberg model is at present impossible, though a fourth-order pertubation expansion for the Heisenberg model
gives rise to a term of 3-spin and a term of 4-spin interactions [14]. But for the Ising model, the demonstration of
multispin interactions by exact methods in statistical physics has been done. The reader is referred to Ref. [15] for
the references on the demonstration of various multi-spin interactions. There has been an increasing number of papers
studying the effect of the multi-spin interaction in various systems [15-17]. This domain is rather recent, very little is
known on the properties stemming from such multi-spin interaction. In this regard, our multi-spin interaction (2) is
original in materials science. We have shown in [12] that it allows to interpret experimental data such as magnetization
plateau below TC.
Let us give some remarks on the multi-spin Hamiltonian (2). We take a single plaquette which is shown in Fig.
2: we see that if two or four of the 5 spins of (2) change their signs, the energy does not vary. There is a large
number of such choices of those flipping spins in a plaquette. However, when the plaquette is embedded in the
lattice, such an invariance of the energy is verified only when the energy earn and the energy loss of such multi-spin
flipping is conpensated, taking into account the neighboring spins of the plaquette. We conjecture that there is more5
chance for the energy invariance to occur, specially when the system is highly excited, near TCfor example. This
will overcome the so-called ”critical slowing-down” near TCknown in the theory of phase transitions and makes the
transition dynamically easier. We will see later that this term makes the transition sharper which is in agreement
with experimental data of Ref. [10]. We will comment and compare our results with [10,11].
C. Monte Carlo Method
For MC simulations, we used samples of dimension N=L×L×L, where Lis the linear system dimension, i. e. the
number of bct cells in each of the x,yandzdirections. We used the periodic boundary conditions in all directions
to reduce the surface effects. We have performed simulations with lattice sizes from 123to 303lattice cells to check
finite-size effects. The results shown below are those of 303lattice size. Note that no significant finite-size effect is
seen from 203.
The first step is to generate a configuration of magnetic ions respecting their concentrations. No configuration
with a deviation more than 1% from the compound formula is accepted. We next thermalize the spin configuration,
starting from a random spin configuration as the initial condition, at a given temperature T. For the MC spin update,
we use the Metropolis algorithm [18,19] modified by an over-relaxation procedure [20,21]. As said above, the spins of
the model is multi-state: for example the spin of Mn3+isS= 2, for the spin update we have to take at random one
state among (2 S+ 1) states: -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, and to use the updating algorithm as follows:
(i) At the time t, we take a spin iand calculate the field Hiacting on it from all neighboring spins, we calculate
the energy of that spin in its current state Eold=−SiHi.
(ii) Now, we take at random a new spin state, called S′
iamong (2 S+ 1) states and calculate the new engergy
Enew=−S′
iHi. Note that Hiis the same. If Enew≤Eoldthen the new state S′
iis accepted. If Enew> Eoldthe new
state is accepted only if R <exp[−β(Enew−Eold] where Ris a random number between 0 and 1, and β= 1/(kBT).
(iii) Given the fact that our system strongly fluctuates, we introduce the over-relaxing procedure due to Creutz
[20,21]. The principle is very simple: we take the advantage of the fact that the acting field Hion spin Sidoes not
change, we repeat the second step (ii) several times (usually 5 to 10 times), expecting that the spin under consideration
Sihas more chance to get an optimal orientation (this ”Creutz” over-relaxation [20,21] has been shown in many works
to be very efficient for systems with strong fluctuations such as frustrated spin systems [19,22]). We go to another
spin and repeat steps (i)-(iii) until all spins are visited. We say we complete a MC step per spin.
(iv) When equilibrium is reached after a large number of MC per spin, we determine thermodynamic properties by
taking thermal averages of various physical quantities defined below.
We have calculated the internal energy per spin E, the specific heat CV, the total magnetization M, the magnetic
susceptibility χ, the spin length of each sublattice, as functions of temperature Tand magnetic field H. The MC run
time for equilibrating is about 105MC steps per spin. The averaging is taken, after equilibrating, over 105MC steps.
A large number of runs with different starting ion configurations have been carried out to check the reproductivity of
results shown below.
The statistical averages of the z(orc) spin component of Mn3+and Mn4+and Pr3+(⟨S1⟩,⟨S2⟩and⟨S3⟩, respec-
tively) are defined by
⟨Sℓ⟩=1
Nℓ⟨X
i∈ℓSi⟩ (3)
where ⟨...⟩indicates the statistical time average and the sum is taken over Mn3+(ℓ= 1) or Mn4+(ℓ= 2) or Pr3+
(ℓ= 3), with Nℓbeing the number of spins of each kind.
The total magnetization Mis defined by
⟨M⟩=gµB(⟨S1⟩+⟨S2⟩+⟨S3⟩) (4)
where gandµBare the ”effective” gyromagnetic factor and the Bohr magneton. Note that in experiments, the
magnetizations of Mn3+, Mn4+and Pr3+were not measured separately, therefore the gyromagnetic factor gwhich
relates the total spin to Mshould be understood as an ”effective g”.
The average internal energy Eper spin, the specific heat CVper spin and the susceptibility CHI per spin are6
defined by
⟨E(T)⟩=1
N⟨(Hp+Hm)⟩ (5)
CV(T) =1
kBT2[⟨E2⟩ − ⟨E⟩2] (6)
χ(T) =1
kBT[⟨M2⟩ − ⟨M⟩2] (7)
Note that since our purpose is not to calculate the critical exponents of the transition, we use just the Metropolis
algorithm modified by introducing the Creutz over-relaxation as described above to determine thermodynamic char-
acteristics of the phase transition. Other advanced MC methods such as the histogram method or the Wang-Landau
technique are of course useful in complicated systems such as frustrated spin systems where the order of the phase
transition cannot be determined otherwise (see implementation of these methods for example in [23,24,25]).
III. MONTE CARLO RESULTS - COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS
After many tests on the values of interaction, we find the following set which gives the best agreement between MC
results and experimental data from Ref. [10]:
J1=−0.1J, J 2= +0 .54J, J 3=−0.1J, J 4=−0.07J, J 5=−0.07J, J 6= 0.30J (8)
C= 0.5 (9)
K= 0.62 (10)
where Jis equal to 1, namely Jis the MC energy unit. Cis the reduction coefficient applied to the interaction
between ions on the caxis. Experimentalists believe that the interaction between Mn ions of the same kind is
weakly antiferromagnetic while that between Mn3+and Mn4+is strongly ferromagnetic so that the overall ordering
is ferromagnetic. That explains our choice of the interaction signs above.
Note that the system is very sensitive to even very small variations of the above values. A fine tuning was necessary.
In a word, J2competes with Kat low T:J2favors the ferromagnetic ordering while K(multi-spin interaction) favors
many states which destroy the ferromagnetic ordering. Near TC,Kcompetes with the inter-sublattice interaction
J4-J6[see the discussion below Eq. (2)].
Using the above interaction values we obtained the MC transition temperature TC(MC) = 0 .7832 in MC unit
ofJ= 1. In order to fit the MC transition temperature with the experimental value TC(exp) = 291 K [10], we
have to multiply all the interaction values given above by J= 291 /0.7832≃371.55. This is possible because TCis
proportional to the exchange interactions.
We show in Fig. 3a the MC result of the total magnetization Mas a function of Tfitted with the experimental
Mtaken from Ref. [10], using J= 371 .55. As seen, except at an intermediate region of temperature, the MC results
coincide with the experimental curve at low Tand strikingly at TC. The transition is very sharp, but it is not a
first-order transition as discussed below. The total magnetic susceptibility χ(T) is shown in Fig. 3b. One observes
here a very high peak of χ(T) atTC. Since χ(T) is calculated by magnetization fluctuations using Eq. (7) the huge
peak is the proof that the magnetization very strongly fluctuates at TC.
Let us note that with the above set of parameters, we did not find the results of Ref. [11]. We will return to this
point in section IV.
We show now in Fig. 4 the spin lengths of three sublattice magnetic ions ⟨S(i)⟩(i= 1,2,3). We see here that
the Mn3+(S(1)) and Mn4+(S(2)) have the same sign, namely they order ferromagnetically, while S(3) (Pr ions) is
ordered antiferromagnetically with the Mn ions. These data are MC results. Experiments did not have access to these.
Note the smooth variation of these quantities across TC. These components vanish at T≃350 K as seen in Fig. 4.
A question is naturally raised: given this smooth variation of spin lengths, how can the total magnetization shown in
Fig. 3 undergo a vertical fall at TC? We have analyzed the MC data and found that at a temperature where the spin
lengths are far from zero ( < S 3>≃ −0.5,< S 1>≃0.26,< S 2>≃0.24) the cancellation of ⟨S1⟩+⟨S2⟩+⟨S3⟩occurs
causing the magnetization to fall vertically to zero at that Twhich was defined as TC(291 K). This is a beautiful
effect of compensation of sublattice magnetizations.
We show in Fig. 5 the internal energy Ein unit of Jversus Tin Kelvin and the specific heat CV(T) in unit of
J/Kelvin . We will calculate Ein real unit later. As seen in this figure, the energy is continuous at TC, so that the
first-order transition at TCis excluded. Note that CV(T) has a a very high peak. As said earlier, due to the strong7

fluctuations induced by the multi-spin interaction, the system energy highly fluctuates giving rise to a strong peak of
CVwhich is calculated by using the energy fluctuations (Eq. 6). If CVis calculated by the derivative of the ”average”
Ewith respect to T, the fluctuations are erased away and we do not have such a huge peak of CV.
IV. DISCUSSION
A. How to calculate the exchange interactions in real unit
Experiments found that J2(interaction between Mn3+and Mn4+dominate and give rise to the ferromagnetic
ordering up to very high temperatures TC= 291 K for Pr 0.55Sr0.45Mn3+
0.55Mn4+
0.45O3.
Since the ordering is ferromagnetic in spite of the fact that the interactions in the system have diiferent signs (FM
and AF), we can consider the system as an ”effective” ferromagnet. We can estimate the amplitudes of physical
parameters in real units using the following formula of the mean-field approximation for ferromagnets [13,26]:
TC=2
3kBZSeff(Seff+ 1)Jeff (11)
where Z= 6Mn+8 ×0.55Pr=10.4 is the effective coordination number at a Mn site and Seffthe effective spin length
which can be taken as the average on the Mn4+, Mn3+and Pr3+using their concentrations: Seff= (0.55×2+0.45×
1.5+0.55×1)/(0.55+0 .45+0 .55) = 1 .5. Putting TC= 291 K in Eq. (11), we obtain Jeff≃= 0.000964 eV ≃9.64 K. In8

magnetic materials with Curie temperatures at room or higher temperatures the exchange interaction is of the order
of several dozens of Kelvin [26,27]. The value found here is of the same order. Note that Jeffis the effective exchange
which is an average of various interactions by the mean-field theory outlined above. The interactions J1, ..., J 6can be
caculated by using the value of J. For example, the dominant one is J2= 0.54J= 0.54×291/0.7832≃200 K, and the
weak AF interaction between Mn ions of the same kind is J1=J3=−0.1J=−0.1×291/0.7832≃37 K. We however
emphasize that using such a mean-field approximation, we obtain the order of magnitude of interaction parameters,
but not to a good precision since the mean-field approximation neglects fluctuations which are very strong in the
present system (see the validity of the mean-field approximation, chapter 4 ”Mean-Field Approximation” of [13]).
The value of the energy in the real unit (eV) can be estimated as follows: using the relation between the classical
ground-state energy E0and the mean-field value of Jeffcalculated above, we have the value of E0given by
E0(MF) =−0.5×Z×S2
eff×Jeff (12)
=−0.5×10.4×1.52×0.000964 ×10−5eV (13)
=−0.01128 ×10−5eV (14)
≃ − 11.28 meV (15)
B. Magnetocaloric Effect - Magnetic Entropy Change
Let us investigate the magneto-caloric effect by calculating the magnetization as a function of the magnetic field
at several given temperatures ranging from the ferromagnetic phase to the paramagnetic phase, across the transition
temperature. We show in Fig. 6 the experimental magnetization versus the magnetic field µ0Hranging from 0.03 to
3 Tesla, for Tranging from 230 K to 340 K (from top curve to bottom one with a step of 10K). The MC results of
the magnetization are also shown for comparison, with Tranging from 230 K to 363 K with a step of 9.5 K (note
that the value of the temperature step is not important).
We obtain a qualitative agreement between the two sets of curves. We have some remarks:
i) The MC magnetization curves far below TCare larger than the experimental curves at low H. We think that this
is because experimental samples are polycrystalline, there are certainly domains, impurities, dislocations, ...resulting
in low Mat low Hand low T, in contrast to MC samples which are on a lattice,
ii) For Tclose to TCand above TC, the agreement between experiments and MC results is better.
These differences will cause a small difference in the magnetic entropy change |∆Sm|which is shown in the following.
The magnetic entropy change |∆Sm|is calculated by applying a field progressively from 0 to µ0Hat two given

The experimental magnetic entropy change |∆Sm|using this formula is shown in Fig. 7 for µ0H=1, 2, 3 Tesla: the
peak temperature increases slightly with increasing H, passing from T= 291 .5K for µ0H= 1 Tesla to T= 299 .5 K
formu 0H= 3 Tesla. Note that the peak height increases with increasing H.

To compare with experimental magnetic entropy change, we carry out the calculation of |∆Sm|using Eq. (17) as
in experiments with the MC magnetizations as shown in Fig. 6a, but with a smaller temperature step, i. e. 4.75 K,
for a better precision (we did not show the whole set of curves in Fig. 6a for clarity of the figure). This gives the
result shown in Fig. 8. Several remarks are in order:
i)|∆Sm|obtained from MC simulations show a peak at each value of µ0Hfrom 1 Tesla to 3 Tesla. The value of
the peak increases with increasing H, in agreement with experiments shown in Fig. 7. The values of the peak height
are very close to those of experiments.
ii) The peak temperarure does not however change with increasing Has observed in experiments. To explain
this difference, we have looked at the experimental results in the paper [28] performed on the same compound with
a different concentration Pr 0.67Sr0.33Mn3+
0.67Mn4+
0.33O3. In [28] several samples have been realized: as one goes from
samples with impuriries, defects,... to the pure one (sample P1200), the peak temperatures do not change significantly
with Hfor the pure sample and the peak widths become then less wide (see Fig. 9 of Ref. [28]). This is what we10

samples of Pr 0.67Sr0.33Mn3+

The formula used to calculate the Relatice Cooling Power (RCP) is
RCP (H) =|∆Smax(H)| ×∆T (18)
where |∆Smax(H)|is the maximum value of |∆Sm(H)|and ∆ Tthe temperature range at the full width at half
maximum.
We show in Table I the experimental Relative Cooling Power (RCP) extracted from Fig. 4 of Ref. [10] and the MC
RCP calculated from the curves of Fig. 8. As seen, there is a slight difference between experiments and MC results.
This difference comes from slightly higher peak values in MC data (Fig. 8). We believe that this is due to the fact
that MC samples are exempt of discolations, impurities, ... unlike experimental samples.
The compound we studied here has high RCP which is very important for high efficiency in applications using the
magnetocaloric effect.
To conclude this section, let us mention several works using a different approach: in Ref. [29 ] the authors used
first the DFT calculations to estimate the pairwise exchange interactions between magnetic ions and use them in MC
simulations to study magnetic, magnetocaloric and thermoelectric properties of perovskite LaFeO3 compound. They
found the magnetization at T= 0 and the value of the Neel tremperature in agreement with experiments. There is
however no information on how the experimental magnetization depends on T. In Refs. [30-31] the same approach has
been applied to study properties of spinel ferrites. Again in these cases, there is no curve of experimental M(T) which
allows for a precise modeling of the detailed interactions in the systems. Our strategy, as shown above, is the reverse:
we find first a model Hamiltonian which reproduces the experimental M(T). Then, by fitting with experiments we
find the values of all interactions in the model.11
V. CONCLUSION
We have compared in this paper our MC results with the magnetic properties of the perovskite compound
Pr0.55Sr0.45Mn3+
0.55Mn4+
0.45O3observed experimentally [10]. In order to get an agreement with the experimental mag-
netization over the whole temperature range, we have included a new multi-spin interaction in the Hamiltonian and
we have used the multi-state Ising model. The experimental transition is likely of first order in view of the vertical
fall of the magnetization at TC. However, MC results on other physical quantities such as the internal energy and the
sublattice spins do show discontinuities at TCin spite of the fact that the specific heat and the susceptibility show
very high peaks (but with a relatively large width). The origin of the huge peaks has been discussed in the light of
spin fluctuations caused by the multi-spin interaction. Since the aim of this paper was not to determine for sure the
nature of the phase transition by advanced MC techniques such as the histogram method [23,24] or the Wang-Landau
algorithm [25], we leave this point for a future study.
We have studied the magneto-caloric effect by calculating the magnetization as a function of the magnetic field µ0H
for several temperatures across the phase transition. From these curves, we calculated the magnetic entropy change
|∆Sm(H)|as a function of the magnetic field, and we deduced the RCP. We have found a qualitative agreement with
experimental data. The difference is very small. The model used here is therefore justified in view of the consistence
with experiments. We emphasize that the main ingredient in the model is the multi-spin interaction. It allows to
reproduce the experimental magnetization below TCand other experimental data. For a system of high disorder such
as the present system, without the multi-spin interaction, we cannot find such a sharp phase transition.
