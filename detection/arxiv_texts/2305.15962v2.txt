1 Introduction
The existing similarities between the structure of the quark and lepton sectors in the Standard Model (SM)
suggestthepossibilityofanewunderlyingsymmetryinparticlephysics. Leptoquarks(LQs)thatcoupleto
both quarks and leptons, with non-zero baryon and lepton numbers, and fractional electric charges are
predictedbyseveralbeyondtheSMtheoriesthatattempttounifythefundamentalinteractions,suchas
technicolour [1–3], composite models [4], and grand unification [5–7].
Recent results reported by BaBar [8, 9], Belle [10] and LHCb [11] show hints of deviations from
lepton-flavouruniversalityin B-mesondecaysintofinalstateswith 𝐷(∗)mesons,whichcouldbecaused
by the existence of LQs. The 4.2 standard deviation disagreement with respect to the SM prediction
observed in the anomalous muon magnetic moment measurement [12], though significantly reduced when
updated lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations [13] are considered, could be caused by LQ
contributions to the muon magnetic moment [14].
Inlightofthelepton-flavouruniversalityanomaliesobservedinthe B-mesondecaysinto 𝐷(∗)𝜏𝜈finalstates,
the couplings of LQs to third-generation quarks and leptons are expected to be large [15]. At the LHC,
third-generation LQs can be produced singly via quark–gluon fusion and quark–gluon scattering or in pairs
via the gluon–gluon fusion process, as shown in the Feynman diagrams in Figure 1. The search presented
in this paper is optimised for the single production of third-generation LQ via the 𝑏𝑔→LQ𝜏→𝑏𝜏𝜏
channel, while LQ pair and non-resonant production processes are also considered since they can also
contribute to the 𝑏𝜏𝜏final state. The single LQ production contribution becomes larger than that from
LQpairproductionathighLQmassandcouplingvalues. Theresultsareobtainedfromproton–proton

The scalar LQ model e𝑆1is also considered, with 𝐹=3𝐵+𝐿=−2and electric charge of 4/3𝑒[20, 21].
There are three parameters in this model: the branching fraction Binto charged leptons, the LQ to 𝜏𝑏

Most of the previous searches for LQs performed by the ATLAS [22–28] and CMS [29–32] collaborations
have been conducted on different final states compared to this search. For third generation LQs, the
CMSCollaborationhasrecently published resultsofsearchesforLQsdecayinginto 𝑡𝜈and𝑏𝜏[33]. The
ATLASCollaborationperformedasearchforpairproducedscalarLQsin 𝑏𝜏𝑏𝜏finalstateswith36fb−1of
proton–proton collision data at√𝑠=13TeVthat excluded scalar LQs with masses below 1 TeV, assuming
a LQ to𝑏𝜏branching fraction equal to one [34].
TheanalysisdescribedinthispaperisthefirstsearchbytheATLASCollaborationforsinglyproduced

𝑏-jet𝑝Tcategories and not relying on a specific LQ model choice for its signal description (henceforth
called‘model-independent’),andcoveringawiderrangeofbeyond-SMsignatures. Forthissearch,the
results are expressed in terms of the visible cross-section of the beyond-SM signal.

2 The ATLAS Detector
TheATLASdetector[16]attheLHCcoversnearlytheentiresolidanglearoundthecollisionpoint.1It
consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid, electromagnetic and
hadron calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting air-core toroidal
magnets.
The inner-detector system (ID) is immersed in a 2Taxial magnetic field and provides charged-particle
tracking in the range of |𝜂|<2.5. The high-granularity silicon pixel detector covers the vertex region
andtypicallyprovidesfourmeasurementspertrack,thefirsthitnormallybeingintheinsertableB-layer
installed before Run 2 [17, 37]. It is followed by the silicon microstrip tracker, which usually provides
eight measurements per track. These silicon detectors are complemented by the transition radiation tracker
(TRT), which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to |𝜂|=2.0. The TRT also provides
electron identification information based on the fraction of hits (typically 30 in total) above a higher
energy-deposit threshold corresponding to transition radiation.
The calorimeter system covers the pseudorapidity range of |𝜂|<4.9. Within the region |𝜂|=3.2,
electromagnetic calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr)
calorimeters,withanadditionalthinLArpresamplercovering |𝜂|<1.8tocorrectforenergylossinmaterial
upstream of the calorimeters. Hadron calorimetry is provided by the steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter,
segmentedintothreebarrelstructureswithin |𝜂|=1.7,andtwocopper/LArhadronendcapcalorimeters.
The solid angle coverage is completed by forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules
optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements respectively.
The muon spectrometer (MS) comprises separate trigger and high-precision tracking chambers measuring
thedeflectionofmuonsinamagneticfieldgeneratedbythesuperconductingair-coretoroidalmagnets.
The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0and6.0Tmacross most of the detector. A set of
precisionchamberscoverstheregion |𝜂|<2.7withthreelayersofmonitoreddrifttubes,complementedby
cathode-strip chambers in the forward region, where the background is highest. The muon trigger system
covers the range of |𝜂|<2.4with resistive-plate chambers in the barrel, and thin-gap chambers in the
endcap regions.
Interesting events are selected by the first-level trigger system implemented in custom hardware, followed
byselectionsmadebyalgorithmsimplementedinsoftwareinthehigh-leveltrigger[38]. Thefirst-level
trigger accepts events from the 40MHzbunch crossings at a rate below 100kHz, which the high-level
trigger reduces in order to record events to disk at about 1kHz.
An extensive softwaresuite [39]is used indata simulation, inthe reconstructionand analysis ofreal and
simulated data, in detector operations, and in the trigger and data acquisition systems of the experiment.
1ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the
detector and the 𝑧-axis along the beam pipe. The 𝑥-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the 𝑦-axis
points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (𝑟,𝜙)are used in the transverse plane, 𝜙being the azimuthal angle around the 𝑧-axis.
The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle 𝜃as𝜂=−ln tan(𝜃/2). Angular distance is measured in units of
Δ𝑅≡√︁
(Δ𝜂)2+(Δ𝜙)2.

Parton luminosities are provided by the five-flavour scheme NNPDF3.0nlo PDF set with a value of
the strong coupling constant 𝛼𝑠=0.118, and the underlying event was modelled with the A14 tune.
The LQ pair-production cross-sections were obtained from the calculation of direct top-squark pair

next-to-next-to-leadingorder(NNLO)inQCDwithresummationofnext-to-next-to-leadinglogarithmic
(NNLL)softgluonterms[49–52]. Thecross-sectionsdonotincludelepton 𝑡-channelcontributions,which
are neglected in Ref. [46] and may lead to corrections at the percent level [53].
Simulated events with pair-produced vector LQs were generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.6.0
at LO in QCD, using the LQ model of Ref. [19] and the NNPDF3.0nlo PDF set with 𝛼𝑠=0.118.
Decays of the LQs were performed with MadSpin , while PS and hadronisation were simulated using
Pythia8.244 with the A14 tune. Since no higher-order cross-sections are available for this model, the LO
MadGraph5_aMC@NLO cross-sections were used.
Several simulation samples are used to model the expected background processes. These include 𝑡¯𝑡, single
top-quark,𝑍and𝑊bosons produced in association with jets ( 𝑍+jetsand𝑊+jets), and diboson events.
The production of 𝑡¯𝑡simulated events was performed with the Powheg Box v2 [54–57] generator at NLO
withthe NNPDF3.0nlo PDFset [58]andthe ℎdampparameter2setto1.5𝑚top[59],with𝑚top=172.5GeV.
The events were interfaced to Pythia8.230 [43] to model the PS, hadronisation, and underlying event,
with parameters set according to the A14 tune and using the NNPDF2.3lo set of PDFs. The 𝑡¯𝑡sample
was normalised to the cross-section prediction at NNLO in QCD including the resummation of NNLL
calculated using Top++2.0 [60–66].
2Theℎdampparameter is a resummation damping factor and one of the parameters that controls the matching of Powhegmatrix
elements to the PS and thus effectively regulates the high- 𝑝Tradiation against which the 𝑡¯𝑡system recoils.

were interfaced with Pythia8.230 using the A14 tune and the NNPDF2.3lo PDF set. The samples were
normalisedtothetheorypredictioncalculatedatNLOinQCDwith Hathor2.1[67,68]. Similarly,the
associated production of top quarks with 𝑊bosons (𝑡𝑊) was modelled by the Powheg Box v2 generator at
NLO in QCD using the five-flavour scheme and the NNPDF3.0nlo set of PDFs. The diagram removal
scheme[69]wasusedtoremoveinterferenceandoverlapwith 𝑡¯𝑡production. Therelateduncertaintyis

69]. The events were interfaced to Pythia8.230 using the A14 tune and the NNPDF2.3lo set of PDFs.
For the production of 𝑍/𝛾∗sample, the Powheg Box v1 [55–57, 70] generator was used for the simulation
atNLOaccuracyofthehard-scatteringprocessesof 𝑍bosonproductionanddecayintotheelectron,muon,
and𝜏-lepton channels. It was interfaced to Pythia8.186 [71] for themodelling of the PS, hadronisation,
and underlying event, with parameters set according to the AZNLO tune [72]. The CT10nlo PDF set [73]
was used for the hard-scattering processes, whereas the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [74] was used for the PS. The
effect of QED final-state radiation was simulated with Photos++ 3.52 [75, 76].
The production of 𝑊+jetsevents was generated with Sherpa2.2.1 [77]. In this set-up, NLO-accurate
matrix elements for up to two partons and LO-accurate matrix elements for up to four partons were
calculated with theComix [78] and OpenLoops [79–81] libraries. The default SherpaPS [82] basedon
Catani–Seymour dipole factorisation and the cluster hadronisation model [83] were used. They employed
the dedicated set of tuned parameters developed by the Sherpaauthors and the NNPDF3.0nnlo PDF
set[58]. TheNLOmatrixelementsforagivenjetmultiplicitywerematchedtothePSusingacolour-exact

Diboson production was simulated with the Sherpa2.2.1 or 2.2.2 generator depending on the process.

NNPDF3.0nnlo set of PDFs were used, along with the dedicated set of tuned PS parameters developed by
theSherpaauthors. The samples were normalised to a NLO prediction.
A summary of all the features used for the simulation of the signal and background processes is shown in
Table 1. In all samples except those produced with Sherpa2.2.1 or Sherpa2.2.2, decays of heavy-flavour
hadrons were modelled with EvtGen1.2.0 or EvtGen1.6.0 program [88], depending on the process.

4 Object Reconstruction and Identification
Tracks measured in the ID are used to reconstruct the interaction vertices [92]. The primary vertex of
thehardinteractionischosenastheproton–protonvertexcandidatewiththehighestsumofthesquared
transverse momenta of the associated tracks.
Electrons are reconstructed from topological clusters of energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter
that are matched to a track reconstructed in the ID [93]. In the 𝜏lep𝜏had(𝜏had𝜏had) final state, the
selected(rejected)electronsarerequiredtosatisfythe‘medium’(‘loose’)identificationcriteriaandhave
𝑝T>20 GeV(15 GeV). Moreover,electronsarerequiredtobewithin |𝜂cluster|=2.47withtheexclusion
oftheregionbetweenthebarrelandendcapcalorimeters( 1.37<|𝜂cluster|<1.52). Anadditional‘loose’
isolation criterion [93] is also required, which has an efficiency of 90%for candidates with 𝑝T>15 GeV,
increasing to more than 98% for candidates with 𝑝T>30 GeV.
MuonsarereconstructedfromsignalsintheMSmatchedwithtracksinsidetheID. Inthe 𝜏lep𝜏hadfinalstate,
the selected muons are required to satisfy the ‘medium’ identification criteria with an average efficiency of
97%, and have𝑝T>25 GeVand|𝜂|<2.5. In the𝜏had𝜏hadchanel, muons having 𝑝T>7 GeVare rejected
iftheysatisfythe‘loose’identificationcriteria. A‘tight’isolationcriterion[94]basedontrackinformation
and having an average efficiency of 89% is also applied.
Jetsarereconstructedwithaparticle-flowalgorithm,whichcombinesenergydepositsinthecalorimeter
withIDtracks[95],usingtheanti- 𝑘𝑡algorithm[96,97]witharadiusparameter 𝑅=0.4. Onlyjetswith
|𝜂|<2.5and𝑝T>25 GeVareconsidered. The‘tight’workingpointofthejetvertextagger(JVT)[98]
algorithm is selected to remove jets with 𝑝T<60 GeVand|𝜂|<2.4that are identified as not being
associated with the primary vertex of the hard interaction. Jets containing 𝑏-hadrons are identified using
the DL1r𝑏-tagging algorithm [99, 100]. A 70%efficiency working point is used, with the efficiencies
beingmeasuredinsimulated 𝑡¯𝑡events. Thecorrespondingrejectionfactors(definedasthereciprocalofthe
efficiency values) for 𝑏-tagged jets initiated by 𝑐-quarks and light partons are 9.4 and 390 respectively.
The𝜏haddecaysarecomposedofaneutrinoandasetofvisibledecayproducts,mostfrequentlyoneorthree
charged pions and up to two neutral pions. The visible decay products of the 𝜏haddecay are denoted by
𝜏had-vis. Thereconstructionofthe 𝜏had-visisseededbyjetsreconstructedbytheanti- 𝑘𝑡algorithm[96],using
calibratedtopologicalclusters[101]asinputs,witharadiusparameterof 𝑅=0.4[102]. Reconstructed
tracks are matched to 𝜏had-viscandidates and a multivariate discriminant is used to assess whether these
tracks are likely to have been produced by the charged 𝜏haddecay products, rejecting tracks originating
fromotherinteractions,nearbyjets,photonconversionsormisreconstructedtracks. The 𝜏had-visobjects
8arerequiredto haveone orthree associatedcharged-particletracks selectedbythis discriminant. Their
charge (𝑞) is defined as the sum of the measured electric charges of these associated tracks and is required
to be|𝑞|=1. The𝜏had-visobjects are also required to satisfy 𝑝T>20 GeVand|𝜂|<2.5, excluding
the region 1.37<|𝜂|<1.52. To separate the 𝜏had-viscandidates produced by hadronic 𝜏-lepton decays
from those due to jets initiated by quarks or gluons, a recurrent neural network (RNN) identification
algorithm [103] ( 𝜏had-ID) is constructed using information from reconstructed charged-particle tracks and
calorimeter-energy clusters associated with 𝜏had-viscandidates. This analysis uses two 𝜏had-ID working
points: ‘medium’,whichhasa 75%(60%)acceptanceefficiencyandabackgroundrejectionof35 (240)
and ‘loose’, which has a 85% (75%) acceptance efficiency and a background rejection of 21 (90) for
𝜏hadwith one (three) charged-particle tracks. A ‘very loose’ working point, having a 95% acceptance
efficiency, is also used for background estimation. A separate boosted decision tree discriminant (‘eBDT’)
is also used to reject backgrounds arising from electrons misidentified as 𝜏had-vis. This discriminant is built
using information from the calorimeter and the ID, most notably transition radiation information from the
TRT system and variables sensitive to the ratio of the energy deposited in the calorimeter to the visible
momentum measured from the reconstructed tracks.
The reconstructed objects used in this analysis are not built from disjoint sets of tracks or calorimetric
clusters. It is therefore possible that two different objects share most of their constituents. An overlap
removal procedure is applied to resolve this ambiguity. This procedure is summarised in Table 2.
The missing transverse momentum vector, ®𝐸miss
T, is reconstructed as the negative vector sum of the
transverse momenta of leptons, 𝜏had-visand jets, and a ‘soft-term’ [104]. The soft-term is calculated as the
vectorial sum of the ®𝑝Tof tracks matched to the primary vertex but not associated with a reconstructed
lepton,𝜏had-visor jet. The magnitude of ®𝐸miss
Tis referred to as the missing transverse energy, 𝐸miss
T.

95 Event Selection
Events are required to contain at least one primary vertex with at least two associated tracks.
For the𝜏lep𝜏hadchannel events were selected by single-lepton triggers. In 2015 single-electron triggers
were simultaneouslyactivewith 𝑝Tthresholdsof 24,60 and120 GeV[105]. For datafrom 2016onward
the𝑝Tthresholds are 26, 60 and 140 GeV. Similarly to the single-electron triggers, the single-muon
triggershad 𝑝Tthresholdsof20and50 GeVfor2015,and26and50 GeVfrom2016[106]. Thetrigger
thresholdswereraisedtokeepthetriggerratessufficientlylowastheluminositywasincreased. Thelowest
𝑝Tthreshold electron and muon triggers also have an isolation requirement. The lepton isolation and

𝜏hadcandidateandexactlyoneelectronoronemuon. Theelectronormuonmustbeisolatedandsatisfy
themediumleptonidentification. Eventswithmorethanoneleptonsatisfyingthemediumidentification
are rejected, considering electrons (muons) with a 𝑝Tgreater than 15 (7) GeV. This helps to reject
𝑍/𝛾∗→𝑒𝑒/𝜇𝜇events and𝑍/𝛾∗→𝜏lep𝜏lep. Furthermore, the electron and muon candidates are required
to have𝑝T>30GeV, and be matched to the trigger object that caused the event to be selected. The
𝜏hadcandidateisrequiredtohave 𝑝T>50GeV,satisfythemedium 𝜏had-IDselectionandhave |𝜂|<2.3.
The pseudorapidity selection requirement rejects events with 𝜏hadcandidates in a region with a higher
backgroundcontaminationandlargeuncertaintiesinthedeterminationoftherateofelectronsmisidentified
as𝜏had.
In the𝜏had𝜏hadchannel, events were selected by a single 𝜏hadtrigger [107]. For 2015 and 2016, three
single𝜏hadtriggerswereavailablewith 𝑝Tthresholdsof80,125and160 GeV. In2017and2018,dueto
higherinstantaneousluminosity,onlythe 𝑝T>160GeVtriggerthresholdwasused. The 𝜏hadidentification
requirements become less stringent as the trigger 𝑝Tthresholds rise. Events must contain at least two
𝜏hadcandidateswheretheleading 𝜏hadcandidatein 𝑝Tmustbematchedtothetriggerwithinanangular
distance ofΔ𝑅=0.2and have𝑝Tthat is at least 5 GeVabove the trigger threshold. The subleading- 𝑝T
𝜏hadcandidate is required to have 𝑝T>65GeV. Identification requirements are applied to both 𝜏had
candidates; the leading- 𝑝T𝜏hadmust satisfy the medium selection and the subleading- 𝑝T𝜏hadthe loose
selection. Events that contain any electron or muon that satisfies the loose identification requirements are
rejected, which ensures orthogonality to the 𝜏lep𝜏hadchannel.
Eventspassingthepreviousrequirementsarethenselectedwithcriteriathataresimilarbetweenthetwo
channels. Thetwo 𝜏hadortheelectron/muon(denotedby ℓ)and𝜏hadmusthaveoppositeelectriccharges
and at least one 𝑏-tagged jet is required. The invariant mass of the visible decay products of the two
𝜏-leptons,𝑚vis(ℓ,𝜏had)or𝑚vis(𝜏had,𝜏had), is required to be above 100 GeV, which is effective at reducing
the𝑍/𝛾∗→𝜏𝜏background. An additional requirement Δ𝜙(ℓ,𝐸miss
T)<1.5is applied in the 𝜏lep𝜏had
channel to reduce single top and 𝑡¯𝑡events.
The variable 𝑆Tis defined as the scalar 𝑝Tsum of the two 𝜏had-vis(orℓand𝜏had-vis) and the leading- 𝑝T
𝑏-jet. A minimum requirement of 𝑆T>300GeVis applied, as there is almost no improvement in the
expected results of the analysis, discussed in Section 8, by adding events with lower 𝑆Tvalues.
The selection criteria described above define the signal region (SR) of the analysis. The signal acceptance
timesefficiencyoftheeventselectionvariesbetween3%and10%,dependingontheLQmassandcoupling.
The efficiency is defined as the ratio of events passing the selection in each channel with respect to the
signal events of the 𝑏𝜏lep𝜏hadand𝑏𝜏had𝜏hadfinal states, respectively. Events in the SR of each channel
are assigned to two categories of low ( <200GeV) and high (>200GeV) transverse momentum of the
leading-𝑝T𝑏-jet. Thetwocategoriesarecalledhighandlow 𝑏-jet𝑝TSRs,respectively. Thehigh 𝑏-jet
10𝑝TSR is found to perform better for low-mass singly produced LQs, where the resonant contribution
is dominant. Conversely, the low 𝑏-jet𝑝TSR has a better acceptance for high mass signals, where the
non-resonant contribution is dominant for signals with 𝑚LQ≥0.9TeV. This split into two categories
improves the expected results of the analysis, discussed in Section 8, by up to 30%.
Alternative selections define the control regions (CR), used to evaluate the contribution of the main
background processes in the SR, and the validation regions (VR), used to verify the good modelling of the
backgrounds. The selection requirements used for the signal regions are summarised in Table 3. The use
of the control and validation regions in the background estimation methods is discussed in Section 6.

6 Background Estimation
6.1𝝉lep𝝉hadchannel
Control and validation regions are used in the analysis to estimate and study the modelling of the main
background processes. The selection requirements used for the CR and VR in the 𝜏lep𝜏hadchannel are
summarised in Table 4.
In the𝜏lep𝜏hadchannel the dominant background contributions are from 𝑡¯𝑡and single top-quark events.
Processesinvolvingtopquarkscanproducereal 𝜏-leptons,orjetsthataremisidentifiedas 𝜏had,andare
estimated by using simulation with data-driven corrections. The 𝑡¯𝑡and𝑡𝑊contributions are treated as one
combined top-quark background due to their similar kinematics and final states. In the low (high) 𝑏-jet𝑝T
SR,𝑡¯𝑡accounts for 90% (86%) of all top-quark processes and 96% (97%) of the single top-quarks are
from𝑡𝑊. Toensurethatthisbackgroundisaccuratelymodelled,atop-quarkcontrolregion(Top-CR)is
defined. WithrespecttotheSRselection,therequirementsontheleading 𝑏-jet𝑝Tandthe𝑆Tareremoved,
and the condition Δ𝜙(ℓ,𝐸miss

theTop-CR,91%arefrom 𝑡¯𝑡processesand∼97%ofthesingletop-quarkeventsarefrom 𝑡𝑊,whichis
compatible with the composition of the SRs.

A discrepancy between the data and simulation prediction is observed in the Top-CR, with the simulation
overestimating the background contribution. Recent measurements of differential cross-sections have
demonstratedthatthecurrentsimulationsof 𝑡¯𝑡processesoverestimatetheuppertailofthetop-quark 𝑝T
spectrum [108, 109]. The discrepancy varies depending on 𝑆T; for this reason, a correction is derived as a
function of𝑆Tin this region based on the ratio between data and simulation. A top-quark correction scale
factor is defined in Eq. (1) and is applied to all 𝑡¯𝑡and single top-quark simulated events. The comparison
between data and the background prediction in the Top-CR and the derived correction as a function of 𝑆T
areshowninFigure2,where 𝑡¯𝑡and𝑡𝑊eventswithageneratedleptonreconstructedasalepton(a‘true’
lepton)andajetmisidentifiedasa 𝜏hadareincludedunderthe Jet→𝜏fakecontribution. Thisdemonstrates
that the Top-CR is dominated by 𝑡¯𝑡and𝑡𝑊events with true leptons and 𝜏hadin the final state, thus this
correction does not account for mismodelling due to jets being misidentified as 𝜏had. The modelling of
events with a true lepton and jet misidentified as a 𝜏hadin the final state is discussed later in this section.
The top-quark correction scale factor is defined as a function of 𝑆T:
𝑆𝐹Top(𝑆T)=(𝑁data−𝑁non−Top)(𝑆T)
𝑁Top(𝑆T), (1)
where𝑁dataand𝑁Toprepresent respectively the number of data events and of 𝑡¯𝑡plus single top-quark
events predicted by simulation, 𝑁Topincludes events with both true and misidentified 𝜏hadin the final state
and𝑁non−Topincludesalltheotherbackgroundsestimatedbyusingsimulation. Theresultingcorrection
is well fitted by a linear function, which is used to derive the correction scale factors. The correction
is also derived with an alternative logarithmic function: 𝑆𝐹Top(𝑆T)=𝑎ln(𝑆T)+𝑏, and the difference
betweenthetwocorrectionsistakenasanuncertaintyonthecorrection. Additionaluncertaintiesrelatedto
the cross-section and acceptance of the top-quark processes, as well as the statistical and cross-section
uncertainties related to the subtraction of the contribution from the other processes, are applied to account
for the slight difference between the fractions of top-quark events that are due to 𝑡¯𝑡production in the
Top-CRandSRsandfortheextrapolationtotheSR. Thescalefactorisappliedattheper-eventleveltothe

binning choices for the 𝑆Tdistribution were also considered, but the impact on the 𝑆𝐹Top(𝑆T)uncertainty
is found to be below 5 %and therefore not considered as an additional source of uncertainty.
Anothersourceofbackgroundinthe 𝜏lep𝜏hadchannelstemsfrommulti-jetevents,wherejetscanmimic
both the𝜏lepand𝜏had. This type of background from multi-jet events is estimated via a data-driven
fake-factor method by derivinga lepton fake-factor. Thelepton fake-factor is measuredin the multi-jet
control region (multĳet-CR) that is enriched in multi-jet events, but is similar kinematically to the SR.
The events are still required to satisfy the single lepton trigger and to have exactly one 𝑏-jet, but the

uncertainty on the 𝐹𝐹lep(𝑝T(𝜏lep),𝜂(𝜏lep))fake-factor and simulation-related uncertainties on 𝑁MCare

uncertainties are in the range of 6–230% as a function of the 𝜏had-vis𝜂and𝑝T. A control region is defined
byhavingthesameselectionastheSR,exceptthattheleptonisolationrequirementinverted. Applying
the fake-factor at the per-event level, the multi-jet estimate in each SR is then obtained by scaling the
distribution in the corresponding control region where the isolation criteria are not satisfied.
An additional source of background are events where a lepton is produced in association with a jet that is
misidentified as a 𝜏had(Jet→𝜏fake). These contribute approximately 20% to the expected background in
the SR and are mostly from 𝑡¯𝑡with contributions from 𝑊+jets,𝑍+jets, and diboson events. To ensure that

In the𝜏had𝜏hadchannel, the main background sources are 𝑍/𝛾∗→𝜏had𝜏hadevents, as well as top-quark
processes, with 𝑊bosons decaying to 𝜏had, or to electrons, muons or jets misidentified as 𝜏had. Both

As the mismodelling of the kinematic distributions observed in the 𝜏lep𝜏hadchannel originates from the
underlying top-quark process rather than the 𝜏haddecay, it is also expected to be present in the 𝜏had𝜏had
channel. However, due to small number of events in the 𝜏had𝜏hadchannel the statistical uncertainty in
thetop-quarkprocessesiscomparablewiththeexpectedmismodelling. Thismakesitdifficulttoselect
a𝜏had𝜏had-only control region to quantify this mismodelling. Therefore, the 𝑆T-dependent top-quark
correctionscalefactorfromEq.(1)derivedinthe 𝜏lep𝜏hadchannelisalsoappliedtothe 𝜏had𝜏hadchannel.
Theshapeofthe 𝑆Tdistributionischeckedandfoundtobecompatiblebetweenthe 𝜏lep𝜏hadand𝜏had𝜏had
channels.
The𝑍/𝛾∗→𝜏had𝜏hadbackground is also modelled using simulation. Due to a known discrepancy in
the simulation compared with the data for 𝑍(→𝜏𝜏)+heavy-flavour jets with at least one 𝑏- or𝑐-jet
(𝑍+HF) [110], a correction factor for the normalisation of this background is derived in the 𝜏lep𝜏had𝑏-jet
𝑍-CR, defined in Table 4, which has a purity of around 60% for the 𝑍+HF processes and is inclusive in 𝑝T
oftheleading 𝑏-jet. Acomparisonbetweenthedataandthepredictionfromthesimulationinthe 𝑏-jet
𝑍-CR before deriving the correction factor is shown in Figure 4.
The scale factor is derived by subtracting backgrounds estimated from simulation that are not from the
𝑍+HF process ( 𝑁non−ZHF):
𝑆𝐹ZHF=𝑁data−𝑁non−ZHF
𝑁ZHF,
where𝑁ZHFis the number of 𝑍+HF events predicted by simulation.

Finally the background originating from multi-jet events, where jets are misidentified as 𝜏had, is estimated
byusingadata-drivenfake-factormethod. Acontrolregiondominatedbymulti-jetevents,calledDĳet-CR,
is defined by taking events that satisfy one of the single-jet triggers (with thresholds between 15 and
420GeV). Theleading 𝜏had-viscandidateisrequiredtonotsatisfythemedium 𝜏hadidentificationandthe
subleading𝜏had-viscandidateisusedasaprobe. Both 𝜏had-viscandidatesarestillrequiredtopassthevery
loose𝜏hadidentification requirement. As for the 𝜏lep𝜏hadchannel, the fake-factor is measured inclusively in
the leading𝑏-jet𝑝T. The leadingand subleading 𝜏had-viscandidates arerequired to haveopposite electric
charges and have a 𝑝T>65GeV. At least one additional 𝑏-tagged jet is required, but no selection is made
on the leading 𝑏-jet𝑝T. Then, the fake-factor is defined as:
𝑓𝜏had−ID(𝑝T,𝑁track)≡(𝑁data−𝑁MC)pass𝜏had−ID(𝑝T,𝑁track)
(𝑁data−𝑁MC)fail𝜏had−ID(𝑝T,𝑁track)
dijet,
where𝑁MCincludesallsimulatedbackgroundevents. Thepassorfail 𝜏had-IDsuperscriptreferstowhether
the subleading 𝜏had-viscandidate satisfies the loose 𝜏had-ID or not, while still satisfying the very loose
requirement. For each of the SRs, the multi-jet estimate is then obtained from the a control region, called
CR-1, composed of events in which the subleading 𝜏had-viscandidate fails the loose 𝜏had-ID, using the
fake-factor:
𝑁multi−jet(𝑝T,𝑁track)=𝑓𝜏had−ID(𝑝T,𝑁track)×(𝑁data−𝑁MC)fail𝜏had−ID(𝑝T,𝑁track).
17The fake-factor is parameterised as a function of the 𝑝Tand number of charged-particle tracks of the
subleading𝜏had-viscandidate. Thestatisticaluncertaintyonthe 𝑓𝜏had−ID(𝑝T,𝑁track)fake-factorisconsidered
as systematic uncertainty, and it varies in the range of 4–15% as a function of the 𝜏had-vis𝑝T, for𝜏had-vis
candidateswithbothoneandthreeassociatedcharged-particletracks. Forthismethodtobeaccurate,it
isimportantthatthefail- 𝜏had-IDandmulti-jetcontrolregionshaveasimilarcompositionofquark-and
gluon-initiated jets. This is obtained by inspecting the shape of subleading 𝜏hadidentification scores in the

is applied on this score, which ensures that the shapes of the distributions are compatible.
After the selection, the multi-jet contribution to the SR is expected to be small. The modelling of the
multi-jet background is verified in the same-sign validation regions (SS-VR). The SS-VR has the same
selection as the SR, but the electric charges of the 𝜏hadcandidates are required to be the same. For key
distributions in the low 𝑏-jet𝑝Tcategory, the data is found to agree with the background prediction, with
approximatelyhalfoftheeventsbeingfrom 𝑡¯𝑡andhalffrommulti-jetbackground. Theselectioninthe
high𝑏-jet𝑝TSS-VR leads to low statistics with 2.8 expected events (mostly from 𝑡¯𝑡) and 4 observed data
events.
7 Systematic Uncertainties
Systematicuncertaintiesarisefromthereconstructionofthevariousphysicsobjectsandfromtheoreticalor
modelling uncertainties affecting the predictions for both the backgrounds and signals. These uncertainties
manifest themselves in both the overall yield and shape of the final observable, and can be divided into two
main groups: the experimental uncertainties and the modelling uncertainties.
The experimental uncertainties include the uncertainties related to the trigger, reconstruction, calibration
and identification of electrons [93], muons [94], taus [102] and jets [98, 99, 111]; for electron and muons,
additionaluncertaintiesintheleptonisolationareconsidered. Uncertaintiesrelatedtobackgroundwith
misidentified 𝜏-leptonsaredescribedinSection6. Anothersourceofexperimentaluncertaintiesisgivenby
the luminosity measurement, whose primary measurement is obtained using the LUCID-2 detector [112].
An uncertainty value of 1.7 %[113] is assigned for the combined 2015–2018 integrated luminosity.
Among the experimental uncertainties, the ones with the highest impact on the analysis sensitivity are
the𝜏had-visrelateduncertainties,withanimpactontheresultsintherangeof30–40 %dependingonthe
LQ coupling and mass values considered. The uncertainties in the 𝜏had-visidentification efficiency are
in the range of 2%to6%, while the eBDT efficiency uncertainties are of the order of 1%to2%. These
uncertainties are parameterised as a function of the 𝜏had-vis𝑝Tand the number of associated tracks for
the𝜏had-visidentificationefficiency,andasafunctionofthe 𝜏haddecaymodefortheeBDTefficiency. In
both cases, the uncertainties are derived in dedicated tag and probe measurements [102]. The 𝜏had-vis
reconstruction efficiency uncertainty is derived from comparisons between simulations using different
detector geometries or Geant4physics lists; this uncertainty is parameterised as a function of true 𝜏had-vis
𝑝Tand is between 1%and1.5%. For the𝜏had-visenergy scale, the total uncertainty is in the range of
1%to4%of the𝜏had-vis𝑝T, arising from a combination of measurements: a direct measurement with
𝑍→𝜏𝜏→𝜇𝜏had-vis+3𝜈events, measurements of the calorimeter response to single particles, and
comparisons between simulations using different detector geometries or Geant4physics lists. This
uncertainty is also parameterised as a function of the 𝜏had-vis𝑝Tand the number of associated tracks.
18The uncertainties in the background modelling include uncertainties in the top-quark, 𝑍+jets and diboson
backgrounds,aswellasmultĳeteventsinwhichquark-orgluon-initiatedjetsaremisidentifiedasa 𝜏had.
Among the background modelling uncertainties, the ones related to the top-quark background have the
largest impact on the analysis sensitivity, with an impact on the results in the range of 40–50 %depending
ontheLQcouplingandmassvalues. Thisuncertaintyisextractedbycomparingnominalandalternative 𝑡¯𝑡
and single top-quark MC samples in the phase space of the SR and Top-CR. For each sample, a dedicated
data-driven𝑆T-dependentcorrectionisappliedbeforethecomparison. Thedifferencebetweenthenominal
andalternativesamplesinthe 𝑆Tdistributionistakenastheuncertaintyinthetop-quarkprocesses. The
alternative samples have variations of the initial/final-state radiation, matrix element and PS compared to
the nominal sample. To derive the initial/final-state radiation uncertainty, the generator parameters used to
producethenominal samplesarevaried. ThematrixelementtoPSNLO matching uncertaintyisderived
by comparing the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO andPowhegpredictions while keeping the same generator
for the PS component. For the PS, the uncertainty is derived by a comparison with an alternative sample
generated by using Herwigfor the PS while keeping the same generator for the hard-scattering simulation
component. The uncertainties in the background modelling originating from the PDF and 𝛼𝑆uncertainties
are found to be less than 1% and are neglected. Finally, an uncertainty in the 𝑡𝑊interference for the single
top-quark background is estimated by comparing the nominal sample, where the diagram removal scheme
is applied, to an alternative sample that uses the diagram subtraction scheme [114].
The uncertainties in the signal modelling include those from the signal cross-section and acceptance
due to renormalisation scale ( 𝜇𝑅) and factorisation scale ( 𝜇𝐹) variations, PDF and 𝛼𝑆. The𝜇𝑅and𝜇𝐹
uncertainties are estimated through an envelope of the variations obtained from scaling 𝜇𝑅and𝜇𝐹by
a factor between 0.5 and 2, while keeping their ratio between 0.5 and 2. The uncertainties due to the
NNPDF3.0nlo PDF set and 𝛼𝑆are evaluated following the PDF4LHC recommendation [115].
8 Results
Thedistributionofthe 𝑆TvariablefortheeventsofthesignalregionsdefinedinTable3forthe 𝜏lep𝜏hadand
𝜏had𝜏hadchannels, is used as final discriminant between the leptoquark signal and the background. The
statistical analysis of the data is performed using the profile likelihood ratio method [116], to test whether
a model can be rejected given the observed data. As the model under test is a signal plus background
hypothesis, the chosen parameter of interest is the signal strength, 𝜇, defined as the ratio of the observed to
the predicted value of the signal cross-section times branching fraction. The likelihood function L(𝜇,𝜃)is
thenconstructedasaproductofPoissonprobabilitytermsforeachbinofthedistributions. Itdependson 𝜇
and on the nuisance parameters 𝜃, which encode systematic uncertainties that can affect the signal and
backgrounddistributionsandareconstrainedusingGaussianprobabilitydensityfunctions. Theasymptotic
approximation is used when constructing the test statistic ˜𝑞𝑢[117] from the likelihood ratio, defined as
˜𝑞𝜇=−2 ln(L(𝜇,ˆˆ𝜃)/L( ˆ𝜇,ˆ𝜃))where ˆ𝜇andˆ𝜃aretheparametersthatdefinetheglobalmaximum-likelihood
function andˆˆ𝜃are the nuisance parameters that give the maximum likelihood for a given value of 𝜇.
To ensure a reliable estimation of the backgrounds in the fit model, the binning in 𝑆Tis optimised so
thatsufficientbackgroundevents(greaterthan10)arepresentineachbinofthepre-fitdistribution. No
significant excess above the background expectations is observed and corresponding limits on production
cross-sections of the LQ signals are set.
For the LQ results interpretation, only the high 𝑏-jet𝑝Tsignal regions from the 𝜏lep𝜏hadand𝜏had𝜏had
channels are considered and fit simultaneously. For the high 𝑏-jet𝑝Tsignal regions, the contribution from
19the non-resonant LQ production process is small. Therefore the interference between the LQ non-resonant
processes and the SM processes is not expected to be substantial in these SRs, and it is neglected. By
setting𝜇=0in the profile likelihood ratio, the test statistic can be used to check for compatibility with the
background-only hypothesis. The data are first fit under the background-only hypothesis and the resulting
post-fit distributions are found to be in good agreement with the data, as shown in Figure 5. Table 6 shows
the yields for the 𝜏lep𝜏hadand𝜏had𝜏hadchannels, respectively.

9 Conclusion
A search for scalar and vector leptoquarks is performed in the 𝑏𝜏𝜏final state using 𝑝𝑝collision data
at√𝑠=13TeVrecorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC from 2015 to 2018 corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 139 fb−1. Final states including one leptonic and one hadronic 𝜏-lepton decay or
two hadronic 𝜏-leptons decays are considered. In each of these two final states, events are classified, based
on the𝑝Tof the𝑏-jet, in two signal regions of low and high 𝑏-jet𝑝T. The benchmark model is 𝑈1for
vectorleptoquarksintheYang–MillsorMinimalcouplingscenarioswith 𝜆between0.5and2.5. Forscalar
leptoquarks the benchmark model is e𝑆1, with values of the 𝜆parameter ranging between 0.5 and 2.5.
Upper limits at 95% CL on the cross-section for leptoquarks produced via either single plus non-resonant
production, or considering all production modes (including pair production), and decaying into 𝑏𝜏are set.
The results have been extracted considering only the high 𝑏-jet signal region and the combination of both
final states. For the Yang–Mills coupling, the observed (expected) lower limits on the leptoquark mass
are 1.58 (1.64) TeVfor𝜆=1.0, 1.70 (1.81) TeVfor𝜆=1.7, and 2.05 (2.28) TeVfor𝜆=2.5, considering
all leptoquark production modes. In the Minimal coupling case, considering all leptoquark production
modes,thelowerlimitsare1.35(1.44) TeVfor𝜆=1.0,1.52(1.63) TeVfor𝜆=1.7and1.99(2.26) TeV
for𝜆=2.5. The observed (expected) lower limits, considering all leptoquark production modes in the e𝑆1
model, are 1.28 (1.37) TeV for 𝜆=1.0, 1.38 (1.49) TeV for 𝜆=1.7and 1.53 (1.67) TeV for 𝜆=2.5.
