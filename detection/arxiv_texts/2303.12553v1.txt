generalizes a classical result by Van den Ven characterizin g linear subspaces of
projective spaces as the only submanifolds with split tange nt sequence.

1. I NTRODUCTION
LetXbe a (not necessarily compact) complex manifold and let Y⊂Xbe
a compact and connected submanifold. We are interested in th e ﬁeldC(X,Y)of
germs of meromorphic functions along Y,i.e.equivalence classes of meromorphic
functions deﬁned on arbitrarily small open subsets of Xcontaining Y.
When the normal bundle of YinXis ample, classical results by Andreotti and
Hartshorne imply that the transcendence degree of C(X,Y)overCis bounded by
the dimension of X. Recently, in [11], the ﬁrst two of the authors of the present
paper proved the existence of germs of smooth surfaces Salong a smooth compact
curveCisomorphic to P1with arbitrary positive self-intersection without non-
constant meromorphic functions.
Our ﬁrst main result is a simpler, yet more general, construc tion of germs of
complex manifolds without non-constant meromorphic funct ions that generalizes
the main result of [11].
Theorem A. For any complex projective manifold Yof dimension nand any pair
of natural numbers (ℓ,m)such that m≥2nandℓ≤m, there exists a germ of
complex manifold Xof dimension mand containing Ysuch that the normal bundle

ofYinXis ample and the transcendence degree of C(X,Y)overCis equal to
ℓ. Moreover, when ℓ= 0 we can further guarantee that Xcarries no irreducible
subvarieties of dimension at least n+1neither foliations/webs of arbitrary non-
zero dimension/codimension.
More informally, if a submanifold Y⊂Xwith ample normal bundle has di-
mension smaller than its codimension then there are no restr ictions on the tran-
scendence degree of C(X,Y)overCbesides the upper bound dimX.
In sharp contrast, when Yis a smooth hypersurface with ample normal bundle
on a complex manifold XanddimY≥2, Rossi proved in [21, Section 5, Theorem
3] the existence of a projective manifold Xand an open subset U⊂Xcontaining
Ythat can be identiﬁed with an open subset of X.
Question 1.1. LetXbe a complex manifold and Y⊂Xa compact submanifold
with ample normal bundle. Does dimX <2dimY(i.e.codimY <dimY)
impliestrdegCC(X,Y) = dimX?
Theorem A and Question 1.1 should be compared with a conjectu re by Peter-
nell [20] which predicts that ﬁeld C(X)of meromorphic functions on a compact
Kähler manifold Xadmitting a subvariety Zwith ample normal bundle satisﬁes
trdegCC(X)≥dimZ+ 1. We do not know if we can construct examples of
pairs(X,Y)withXcompact Kähler with arbitrary trdegCC(X,Y). Peternell’s
conjecture predicts that this is not the case.
One of the main ingredients of our proof of Theorem A is an old t rick attrib-
uted to Haeﬂiger and explored by Loeb-Nicolau, López de Medr ano-Verjovsky,
and Meersseman, see [17, Introduction] and references ther ein. In order to con-
struct complex manifolds, it sufﬁces to construct smooth di fferentiable manifolds
transverse to holomorphic foliations. Another key ingredi ents used in the proof
of Theorem A are the very same results by Andreotti and Hartsh orne mentioned
above that served as motivation for this work.
Although we are not able to provide an answer to Question 1.1, our second main
result shows that the method of proof of Theorem A cannot be ap plied to produce
counter-examples to it.
Theorem B. LetFbe a codimension qfoliation on Pnand letZ⊂Pnbe a
submanifold disjoint from sing(F). Ifq <2dimZand, for every z∈Z, the
intersection of the tangent spaces of FandZatzhas the expected dimension
max{0,dimZ+dimF−n}thenFis algebraically integrable.
As we will explain in Section 4, Theorem B is strictly related to a classical result
of Van de Ven [23] characterizing linear subspaces of projec tive spaces. We also
point out, that it is unclear what the optimal statement shou ld be. It is conceivable
that under the assumptions of Theorem B the foliation Fmust deﬁned by a linear
projection ( i.e.Fhas degree zero). We actually prove this when Fis a foliation
by curves, see Theorem 4.4.

2.1. Conventions. Although we are mainly interested on submanifolds of com-
plex manifolds, we will need to consider the more general not ion of complex
analytic spaces in the sense of Grauert, see for instance [13 , Appendix B]. To
wit, subvarieties are closed complex analytic subspaces wi thout nilpotents in their
structural sheaves, and submanifolds are smooth subvariet ies.
2.2. Inﬁnitesimal neighborhoods. LetXbe a complex manifold and let Y⊂X
be a closed and connected complex analytic subspace. If Iis the deﬁning ideal
sheaf ofYthenn-th inﬁnitesimal neighborhood of Yis the complex analytic space
Y(n)with underlying topological space equal to Yand structural sheaf equal to
OX
In+1.
There are natural inclusions Y(n)֒→Y(n+1) between inﬁnitesimal neighbor-
hoods ofYinduced by the natural restriction morphisms
OX
In+2→OX
In+1.
The formal completion of XalongY, denoted here by Y(∞), is the formal analytic
space obtained as the direct limit of Y(n)whenngoes to∞,i.e.
Y(∞) = lim−→Y(n).
In other words, Y(∞)is the ringed space with underlying topological space equal
toYand with structural sheaf equal to the inverse limit
OY(∞)= lim←−OX
In+1= lim←−OY(n).
2.3. The ﬁeld of formal meromorphic functions. Following [14], we deﬁne the
sheafMY(∞)of (formal) meromorphic functions on Y(∞)as the sheaf associ-
ated to the presheaf with sections over an open subset U⊂Yequal to the total
ring of fractions of OY(∞)(U). We will denote the global sections of MY(∞)by
C(Y(∞)).
As we are assuming that Yis connected C(Y(∞))is a ﬁeld, see [5, Proposition
9.2]. Moreover, we have injective restriction morphisms
(2.1) C(X)֒→C(X,Y)֒→C(Y(∞)).
WhenYis a point on a n-dimensional projective manifold X, thenC(X,Y)is
the quotient ﬁeld of the ring of convergent power series C{x1,...,x n}while
C(Y(∞))is the quotient ﬁeld of the ring of formal power series C[[x1,...,x n]].
Therefore, in general, both inclusions can have inﬁnite tra nscendence degree.4 MAYCOL FALLA LUZA, FRANK LORAY, AND JORGE VITÓRIO PEREIRA
In sharp contrast, Hironaka and Matsumura [14, Theorem 3.3] proved the fol-
lowing result for subvarieties of projective spaces.
Theorem 2.1. LetYbe a closed and connected complex analytic subspace of Pn,
n≥2. IfdimY≥1thenC(Y(∞)) =C(X,Y) =C(Pn).
For an analytic version of Theorem 2.1, establishing the equ alityC(X,Y) =
C(Pn)through Hartog’s theorem and without the use of formal geome try, see [22,
Theorem 3].
WhendimY >0and the normal bundle of Yis ample, we can rephrase a result
by Hartshorne [12, Theorem 6.7 and Corollary 6.8] to our sett ing as follows.
Theorem 2.2. LetYbe a connected and compact complex analytic subspace of a
complex manifold X. IfYis locally a complete intersection of dimension at least
one and the normal bundle NY/X is ample then the transcendence degree over C
ofC(Y(∞))is bounded by the dimension of X. Moreover, if trdegCC(Y(∞)) =
dimXthenC(Y(∞))is a ﬁnitely generated extension of C.
Although Theorem 2.2 was originally stated in the algebraic category,
Hartshorne’s proof works, as it is, in the context of complex manifolds considered
here.
When the ambient manifold Xis projective (or more generally Moishezon) and
Yhas ample normal bundle, Theorem 2.2 implies that C(Y(∞))is a ﬁnite al-
gebraic extension of C(X). Consequently, in this case, both inclusions in (2.1)
are ﬁnite algebraic extensions. This fact combined with the proposition below,
due to Badescu and Schneider (see [6, Proposition 3.5] or [5, Proposition 10.17]),
imply the convergence of formal meromorphic functions deﬁn ed on formal neigh-
borhoods of subvarieties with ample normal bundle on projec tive manifolds.
Proposition 2.3. LetXbe a projective manifold and Y⊂Xa connected sub-
variety. Then the algebraic closure of C(X)inside of C(Y(∞))is contained in
C(X,Y).
Corollary 2.4. LetXbe a projective manifold and Y⊂Xa connected subvariety
with ample normal bundle. Then C(X,Y) =C(Y(∞)).
Question 2.5. If the ambient space is not projective, just a small euclidea n neigh-
borhood of Y, is it true that the ampleness of NYimplies the convergence of the
formal meromorphic functions ?
Rossi’s theorem ([21]) gives a positive answer when Yis a hypersurface of
dimension at least two.
2.4. Continuation of analytic subvarieties. The next result was proved by Rossi
in [22, Theorem 3.2] under the additional assumption dim(V∩Y) +n=
dimY+ dimV. The improvement below is due to Chow [9, Corollary of The-
orem 4]. Unaware of Chow’s improvement on Rossi’s result, on e of the authors
of the present paper obtained an alternative proof of Rossi- Chow Theorem in [19,
Theorem C].SUBMANIFOLDS WITH AMPLE NORMAL BUNDLE 5
Theorem 2.6. LetY⊂Pnbe an irreducible subvariety and let U⊂Pnbe a
Euclidean neighborhood of Y. IfV⊂Uis an irreducible subvariety of Uwith
dimV+dimY > n and non-empty intersection with Ythen there exists a projec-
tive subvariety V⊂Pnsuch that Vis an irreducible component of V∩U.
Bost [4, Theorem 3.5], Bogomolov-McQuillan [2], Campana-P aun [7, Theorem
1.1], Druel [10, Proposition 8.4], and others, used variant s of Hartshorne’s argu-
ment to establish algebraicity criteria for leaves of folia tions on projective varieties.
See also the work of Chen [8, Theorem A] for an algebraicity cr iterion for formal
subschemes of projective schemes. Here we point out that we c an deduce from
Theorem 2.2 a variant of Theorem 2.6.
Proposition 2.7. LetXbe a projective manifold, let Y⊂Xbe an irreducible lo-
cally complete intersection analytic subspace/subscheme with ample normal bun-
dle, and let U⊂Xbe a small Euclidean neighborhood of Y. IfV⊂Uis a closed,
irreducible, smooth subvariety of Usuch that
(1)dimV+dimY >dimXand
(2)dim(V∩Y)+dimX= dimY+dimV
then there exists a projective subvariety V⊂Xsuch that Vis an irreducible
component of V∩U.
Proof. Condition (1) implies that dimV∩Y >0. Condition (2) implies that the
codimension of V∩YinVequals the codimension of YinX. Therefore V∩Yis
a locally complete intersection analytic subspace of Vwith ample normal bundle
and positive dimension. Consider the Zariski closure V⊂XofVand notice
thattrdegCC(V) = trdeg CC(V∩Y(∞)). On the other hand, we can apply
Theorem 2.2 to V∩Y⊂Vand get that trdegCC(V∩Y(∞))≤dim(V), and
conclude. /square
3. C ONSTRUCTION
We carry out the proof of Theorem A in this section.
3.1. Weakly transverse submanifolds. LetFbe a singular holomorphic foliation
on a complex manifold W. We will say that a submanifold Z⊂Wis weakly
transverse toFif
(1) the singular set of Fdoes not intersect Z; and
(2) for every point z∈Z, the tangent space of Zatzintersects the tangent
space ofFatzonly at0.
The relevance of the concept to our discussion is put in evide nce by our next
result.
Proposition 3.1. LetFbe a singular holomorphic foliation on a complex manifold
W. IfZ⊂Wis a compact submanifold weakly transverse to Fthen there exist
a neighborhood UofZ; a complex manifold Xof dimension equal to dimW−
dimF; and a holomorphic submersion π:U→Xsuch that
(1) the leaves ofF/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Ucoincide with the ﬁbers of π; and6 MAYCOL FALLA LUZA, FRANK LORAY, AND JORGE VITÓRIO PEREIRA
(2) the morphism πmapsZisomorphically to a submanifold YofXwith
normal bundle isomorphic to the quotient of NZ/W by the image of TF/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Zinside it; and
(3) the ﬁeld of germs of meromorphic functions C(X,Y)is mapped by π∗
isomorphically onto the ﬁeld of germs of meromorphic ﬁrst in tegrals of the
germ of foliationF/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
(W,Z).
Proof. LetUbe equal to a sufﬁciently small tubular neighborhood of ZinW. The
weakly transversality between FandZimplies that the leaves of F/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Uare closed
subvarieties of U. Therefore the leaf space X=U/FofF/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Uis a Hausdorff
complex manifold. The quotient morphism π:U→Xhas the sought properties.
/square
3.2. Formal meromorphic functions versus rational ﬁrst integra ls.The ﬁeld of
meromorphic functions of the leaf space constructed in Prop osition 3.1 is described
by the lemma below.
Lemma 3.2. Notation and the assumptions as in Proposition 3.1. Further assume
thatW=Pm. IfY(∞)⊂Xis the formal completion of Y=π(Z)inXthen
C(Y(∞))is isomorphic to the ﬁeld of rational ﬁrst integrals of the fo liationF.
Proof. Direct consequence of Hironaka-Matsumura result discusse d in Subsec-
tion 2.3. Indeed, the pull-back of C(Y(∞))underπis the subﬁeld of C(Z(∞))
formed by the formal meromorphic ﬁrst integrals of F/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Z(∞). By Hartshorne result,
C(Z(∞))coincides with the ﬁeld C(W) =C(Pm)the ﬁeld of rational functions
onW. Consequently, we get an isomorphism between C(Y(∞))and the ﬁeld of
rational ﬁrst integrals of F. /square
Remark 3.3.Likewise, whenFis a global foliation on Pn, foliations/webs living
in the leaf space of F/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Ucorrespond to global foliations/global webs invariant by
F. This again is a consequence of Hartshorne’s result.
The situation for subvarieties of the leaf space is slightly different, and it is not
true that their pre-iamges under the quotient morphism can a lways be globalized.
Lemma 3.4. Notation and the assumptions as in Proposition 3.1. Further assume
thatW=Pm. IfS⊂X=U/Fis a subvariety intersecting Y=π(Z)such that
dimS+dimY >dimXthenπ−1(S)is contained in aF-invariant subvariety S
ofPmwithdimS= dimS+dimF.
Proof. Direct consequence of Theorem 2.6. /square
3.3. Existence of weakly transverse submanifolds. As shown below, the exis-
tence of weakly transverse submanifolds, under suitable nu merical assumptions, is
easy consequence of Kleiman’s transversality of a general t ranslate.
Lemma 3.5. LetFbe a foliation by curves on Pm+1with isolated singularities.
LetY⊂Pm+1be a projective submanifold of dimension n. Ifm≥2nthenYis
weakly transverse to g∗Ffor any general g∈Aut(Pm+1).SUBMANIFOLDS WITH AMPLE NORMAL BUNDLE 7
Proof. The proof is a simple application of Kleiman’s transversali ty of a general
translate, [15, Theorem 2]. Indeed, we can identify the proj ectivization of the
tangent bundle of Y,P(TY)(space of lines on TY), with a submanifold τ(Y)of
PTPm+1of dimension 2n−1. Likewise, we consider τ(F)⊂P(TPm+1)as the
Zariski closure of the tangent lines of F/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Pm+1−sing(F). As such τ(F)⊂P(TPm+1)
is a subvariety of dimension m+1. By assumption
dimτ(Y)+dimτ(F)<dimP(TPn).
Since the natural action of Aut(Pm+1)onP(TPm+1)is transitive, we can apply [15,
Theorem 2] to guarantee that, for a general g∈Aut(Pm+1),g∗τ(F) =τ(g∗F)is
disjoint from τ(y). The lemma follows. /square
3.4. Field of rational ﬁrst integrals of foliations on projectiv e manifolds. Let
Fbe a foliation on a projective manifold X. According to [3], there exists a unique
foliation by algebraic leaves GcontainingFand such that C(F) =C(G).
Example 3.6. Letλ1,...,λ m+1be complex numbers and consider the following
vector ﬁeld on Cm+1
v=m+1/summationdisplay
i=1λixi∂
∂xi.
The foliationFonPm+1deﬁned by vhas Zariski closure Gof dimension equal
to the dimension of Q-vector subspace of Cgenerated by λ1,...,λ m+1. In par-
ticular, choosing appropriately the complex numbers λwe have one dimensional
foliations on Pm+1having ﬁeld of rational ﬁrst integrals of any transcendence de-
gree between 0andm.
3.5. Proof of Theorem A. LetFbe a one-dimensional foliation Pm+1with ﬁeld
of rational ﬁrst integrals of transcendence degree ℓoverC. For instance, we can
take a foliationFas in Example 3.6. Embed YinPm+1. According to Lemma
3.5 we can assume that Yis weakly transverse to F. Proposition 3.1 implies the
existence of an Euclidean open subset U⊂Pm+1containing Ysuch that the leaf
spaceX=U/F/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
UhasC(X)equal toC(F/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U). Lemma 3.2 implies that C(X)
equals to C(F). This shows that the leaf space X=U/F/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Uis a complex manifold
of dimension mcontaining Yand withtrdegCC(X,Y) =ℓas claimed.
The last claim concerning the existence of manifolds with ℓ= 0 follows from
Remark 3.3 and Lemma 3.4 combined with [18, Theorem 1] which g uarantees that
the very general one-dimensional foliation on Pm+1of degree at least two is not
tangent to any other foliation or web and does not leave invar iant any algebraic
subvariety. /square
4. A LGEBRAICITY
In this section we will present a proof of Theorem B from the In troduction.
Actually Theorem B is the combination of Theorems 4.1 and 4.4 below.8 MAYCOL FALLA LUZA, FRANK LORAY, AND JORGE VITÓRIO PEREIRA
4.1. Submanifolds transverse to foliations. We start by treating submanifolds
transverse to foliations.
Theorem 4.1. LetFbe a codimension qfoliation on a projective space Pn. IfZ⊂
Pnis a submanifold disjoint from sing(F)and transverse toFthendimZ=q,Z
is a linear subspace, and the foliation Fhas degree zero.
Proof. Leti:Z→Pnbe the natural inclusion and let ω∈H0(Pn,Ωq
Pn⊗detNF)
be aq-form deﬁningF. Observe that dimZ≥q= codimFby the deﬁnition of
transversality. Moreover, i∗ω∈H0(Z,Ωq
Z⊗detNF/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Z)is an everywhere non-zero
twistedq-form on Z. IfdimZ≥q+1theni∗ωdeﬁnes a smooth foliation on Z
of positive dimension. Bott’s vanishing theorem implies th at(detNF/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Z)q+1= 0.
ButdetNF/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Zis an ample line-bundle and q+1≤dimZ, hence(detNF/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Z)q+1/ne}ationslash=
0. We obtain in this way a contradiction that establishes that dimZ=q. Therefore
the non-vanishing of i∗ωimplies that the canonical sheaf Ωq
Zis isomorphic to
detN∗
F/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Z=OZ(−deg(F)−q−1). Kobayashi-Ochiai Theorem [16, Corollary
of Theorem 1.1] implies that Z=Pq,deg(F) = 0 anddeg(Z) = 1 . /square
Remark 4.2.LetFbe a codimension qfoliation on a projective manifold X. If
Z⊂Xis a submanifold with ample normal bundle, disjoint from sing(F), and
transverse toFthen proof of Theorem 4.1 shows that dimZ=q. HenceTF/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Z≃
NZis ample and we can apply [4, Theorem 3.5] or [2] to guarantee t hat every leaf
ofFpassing through the points of Zis algebraic. Consequently, by dimension
reasons, every leaf of Fis algebraic andFis algebraically integrable.
We present below a proof of a classical result by Van de Ven.
Corollary 4.3. LetXbe a submanifold of Pn. If the normal sequence
0→TX→TPn/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
X→NX→0
splits then Xis a linear subspace of Pn.
Proof. Letqbe the codimension of X. The existence of a splitting ϕ:NX→
TPn/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
Xgives us for every x∈X, a unique linear Pqthroughxwith tangent space
atxequal toϕ(NX(x)). IfUis a sufﬁciently nieghborhood of Xthen this family
ofPq’s will not intersect at U, and will thus deﬁne a codimension qfoliationFUon
U. Theorem 2.2 implies that FUextends to a foliation FonPn. By construction
Fis transverse to X. Theorem 4.1 implies the result. /square
4.2. Submanifolds weakly trasnverse to foliations. Our last result treats the case
of submanifolds weakly transverse to foliations.
Theorem 4.4. LetFbe a codimension qfoliation on Pn. IfZis a submanifold
weakly transverse to Fandq <2dimZthenFis algebraically integrable. More-
over, ifdimF= 1thendeg(F) = 0 .
Proof. LetU⊂Pnbe a sufﬁciently small Euclidean neighborhood of Z. Let
π:U→U/Fbe the quotient of UbyF/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U. Observe that V=π−1(π(Z))is a
closed subvariety of Uof dimension
(4.1) dimF+dimZ.SUBMANIFOLDS WITH AMPLE NORMAL BUNDLE 9
Hence our assumptions imply that dimZ+dimV= 2dimZ+dimF> n. The-
orem 2.6 implies that V, the Zariski closure of V, andVhave the same dimension.
SinceVis invariant byF/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
U,Vis also invariant by F.
LetGbe the unique foliation by algebraic leaves containing Fand withC(F) =
C(G)given by [3]. After replacing ZbygZfor a sufﬁciently general automor-
phismg∈Aut(Pn), we can assume that the Zariski closure of a leaf of Fthrough
a general point zofZcoincides with a leaf of G. Therefore
(4.2) dimV= dimG+dimZ.
SincedimV= dimV, we can combine Equations (4.1) and (4.2) to establish the
algebraicity of the leaves of F, in other termsF=G.
In the one dimensional case, weakly transversality implies the existence of a
nowhere zero section of NZ⊗ωF|Z, thusccod(Z)(NZ⊗ωF) = 0 .
SinceNZis an ample vector bundle, and the Chern classes of ample vect or
bundles are strictly positive according to [1, Theorem 2.5] , we deduce that ωFis
not nef. Since ωF|Z=OZ(deg(F)−1)we necessarily have deg(F) = 0 as
claimed. /square
Remark 4.5.We believe that a similar statement should hold true if Pnis replaced
by an arbitrary projective manifold and Zis replaced by a submanifold with ample
normal bundle.
