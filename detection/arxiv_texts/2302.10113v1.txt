In this work, we study the role of viscoelastic instability in the mechanical dispersion of uid
ow through porous media at high P eclet numbers. Using microuidic experiments and numerical
simulations, we show that viscoelastic instability in ow through a hexagonally ordered (staggered)
medium strongly enhances dispersion transverse to the mean ow direction with increasing Weis-
senberg number (Wi). In contrast, preferential ow paths can quench the elastic instability in
disordered media, which has two important consequences for transport: First, the lack of chaotic
velocity uctuations reduces transverse dispersion relative to unstable ows. Second, the amplica-
tion of ow along preferential paths with increasing Wi causes strongly-correlated stream-wise ow
that enhances longitudinal dispersion. Finally, we illustrate how the observed dispersion phenom-
ena can be understood through the lens of Lagrangian stretching manifolds, which act as advective
transport barriers and coincide with high stress regions in these viscoelastic porous media ows.
I. INTRODUCTION
The ow of viscoelastic uids through porous media
governs material transport and mixing in a range of geo-
physical, biological, and industrial systems [1, 2]. Bac-
terial biolms proliferate in soils and cause infections in
bodily tissue [3], and ltration media are used in food
and polymer processing [4]. Polymer additives improve
the ecacy of hydraulic fracturing and enhanced oil re-
covery (EOR) [5{7], including the remediation of oil gan-
glia [8{12]. In the latter case of EOR for example, de-
spite extensive eorts to observe and understand the im-
pact of viscoelastic ow, no globally accepted remedia-
tion mechanism via polymer additives has been estab-
lished [13{16]. However, the onset of unsteady velocity
uctuations in such viscoelastic porous media ows [17{
19] appears to play a critical role in microscale trans-
port [17, 20{22], where porous microstructure couples
pore-scale viscoelastic ows [23] to sample-scale trans-
port properties [24]. The non-Newtonian rheology of vis-
coelastic uids encodes a memory of the ow history,
whose non-trivial dependence on pore geometry [25{28]
can result in viscoelastic instability [17, 29{37]. A deeper
understanding of the interplay between rheology, ow
structure, and dispersion is paramount to predicting ma-
terial transport in viscoelastic porous media ows.
In the absence of inertia, strong elastic stresses cause
viscoelastic ow instabilities in porous media, which are
heavily dependent on the ow geometry [35, 37]. The
transition to chaotic dynamics in viscoelastic ows is
characterized by the Weissenberg number, Wi =_,
which compares elastic forces to viscous forces. Here, is

ations at large Wi have been shown to enhance transverse
dispersion in ordered porous media ows [17] via a \lane-
changing" eect [38]. In contrast, markedly weaker dis-
persion enhancement has been reported for viscoelastic
ows in disordered media [20{22]. Recent experiments
have shed new light on the geometry-dependent transi-
tion to chaos and the resulting ow topologies, which ul-
timately regulate the dispersion properties. The critical
Weissenberg number, Wi cr, is highly sensitive to both
the disorder of the medium [35] and orientation of or-
dered media relative to the ow [37]. Preferential ow
paths in disordered media and along lattice directions
in periodic media reduce extensional deformation and
stress, and ultimately suppress the transition to chaos
compared to staggered obstacle arrangements in ordered
systems at the same Wi [35, 37]. This topological and
dynamical shift in the ow eld with geometry must be
intrinsically linked to the transport properties. However,
a comprehensive understanding of how viscoelastic ow
instabilities regulate dispersion in porous media remains
lacking.
In this work, we characterize how changes in vis-
coelastic ow topology regulate anisotropic dispersion in
porous media ows, and elucidate the underlying mech-
anisms for geometry-dependent transport. Microuidic
experiments are complemented by numerical simulations
for quasi-two-dimensional model porous media for both
hexagonally ordered (staggered) and disordered arrays
of cylindrical pillars. Our results capture the accepted
enhancement of transverse dispersion via ow instabil-
ity in ordered ow and also reveal that the amplica-
tion of preferential ow paths in the disordered media
increases longitudinal dispersion [Fig. 1]. Furthermore,
recent theoretical work based on a Lagrangian analysisarXiv:2302.10113v1  [physics.flu-dyn]  20 Feb 20232
of viscoelastic ows demonstrated that the uid stretch-
ing eld closely reects the polymeric stress topology [39].
We show that transverse and longitudinal dispersion can
be understood through the structure of the Lagrangian
stretching eld, whose manifolds act as barriers to advec-
tion and dynamically guide transport in both steady and
unsteady ows. These results demonstrate a potential
mechanism for tuning anisotropic dispersion, and they
illustrate a direct link between elastic stress and trans-
port in viscoelastic porous media ows.
II. METHODS
A. Experimental methods
Following established approaches from previous
work [35], microuidic devices were designed and fab-
ricated with 25 mm long, 4 mm wide, and 50 m high
straight main channels, which contain arrays of cylin-
drical pillars (diameter, d=50m) in both an ordered
and disordered conguration. Photolithography masks
were generated by rst specifying an ordered, hexagonal
array in a staggered orientation relative to the ow direc-
tion [37], which had a lattice constant, a=120m. The
disordered geometry was created by randomly perturb-
ing the pillar locations from the original lattice within
a hexagonal circumradius, a. The viscoelastic uid is a
solution of high molecular weight polyacrylamide (PAA;
18×106MW) at a concentration of 150 ppm of PAA in
a viscous Newtonian solvent (97% aqueous glycerol) [40].
The solution was prepared by mixing 1 g of PAA into
200 mL of DI water using a magnetic stirrer for 1 hr.
3 g of the aqueous PAA solution was mixed with 97 g
of glycerol for 12 hr. Finally, the uid was seeded with
0.5m and 1m diameter tracer particles for simul-
taneous particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle
tracking, respectively.
Capillary breakup extensional rheology (CaBER) was
used to characterize the (longest) relaxation time, , of
the PAA solutions [41], which provides a more relevant
measure of the relaxation time for stongly elongational
ows compared to shear rheology [42, 43]. The PAA
solution was stretched between two dowels, and the mea-
sured exponential decay rate of the liquid bridge diameter
(3) gave a relaxation time =1:14±0:1 (N=6). The
shear-rate dependence of the viscoelastic uid was char-
acterized using a strain controlled rheometer (TA-2000)
with a cone and plate geometry. The polymer solution
was pre-sheared at a rate of 1 s−1for 120 s, then each
measurement was held at the respective shear rate for
60 s and measured for 15 s. The PAA solution exhibited
a weak shear thinning behavior, which is well tted by
the Carreau-Yasuda model [44]. The measured shear vis-
cosity,, was in the range 2 Pa-s ≥≥0.5 Pa-s for shear
rates in the range 0 :01≤_≤10 s−1.
For ow experiments through pillar arrays, the vis-
coelastic uid was pressure-driven through the microu-idic channels (Elveow OB1), and video microscopy
(Nikon Ti-e; 10 ×, 0.3 NA objective) captured the mo-
tion (100 fps; Andor Zyla) of uorescent tracer particles.
Time-resolved velocity elds, u(r;t), were measured us-
ing PIV [45], and Lagrangian statistics were obtained by
simultaneous particle tracking. A maximum Reynolds
number of Re =Ud/slash.left/uni227210−4(density,; mean ow
speed,U) ensured that inertial eects were negligible and
that the emergence of ow instability only depended on
elastic eects. Experiments were limited to a transport
regime dominated by advection, as determined by the
P eclet number, Pe =Ud/slash.leftD(), where 105≤Pe≤109and
Daccounts for the viscosity dependent Stokes-Einstein
diusion coecient of the tracers.
B. Numerical methods
The numerical simulations were performed in a two-
dimensional domain that was designed to exactly match
the region-of-interest in experiments [Fig 1 (a)] via
computer-generated photomasks. The ow of incom-
pressible polymeric uid in the interstitial region of the
porous geometry is described by the conservation of mass
and momentum as:
∇⋅u=0; (1)
/parenleft.alt3@u
@t+u⋅∇u/parenright.alt3=−∇p+∇⋅; (2)
where uandpare the uid velocity and pressure eld,
respectively. The total stress tensor is written as =
s+p, where sandpare the solvent and polymeric
stress tensor, respectively. For the Newtonian solvent,
sis given as s=s(∇u+∇uT), wheresis the solvent
viscosity. We chose the FENE-P constitutive equation to
calculate the polymeric stresses because it captures both
elasticity and shear thinning behaviours as well as nite
extensibility of polymeric chains [46, 47]:

represents the ratio of the maximum allowable length,
R0, to the equilibrium length, Re, of the polymeric chains
[46{48]. For the FENE-P model, a typical range of L2is
10-1000 [22, 47, 49, 50], which reduces to the Oldroyd-B
constitutive model in the limit of L2→∞. The upper3
convective time derivative operator ∇used in equation 3
is given by:
∇p=Dp
Dt−p⋅∇u−∇uT⋅p: (5)
The numerical simulations were performed using an
open-source framework RheoTool [51] integrated with
OpenFOAM [52], where the equations were discretized
using a nite volume method and the log-conformation
approach was used to calculate the polymeric stress ten-
sor. The relationship between the polymeric stress ten-
sor,p, and the log-conformation tensor, , is given as:
p=p
(fe−bI): (6)
The implementation and the validation of the numerical
tool can be found in previous works [51, 53]. The dimen-
sionless numbers used in the simulations were: Re =10−4,
0:1≤Wi≤5,=s/slash.left(s+p)=0:02, andL2=1000. The
ow was driven with a constant inlet velocity of 50 m/s
on the left side of the channel with no-slip boundaries on
the top and bottom walls [Fig 1].
For both experiments and simulations, the Lagrangian
stretching, S(x;t), is determined from the time re-
solved ow eld [54, 55] by using established meth-
ods [39, 56, 57]. Briey, uid element positions, x0, at
timet=t0are deformed by a ow eld, u(x;t), and
advected to new positions, x, at time,t1=t0+. The
ow map, F(x0)=x, is determined as the solution to
dx
dt=u(x;t), and the (right) Cauchy-Green strain ten-
sor is formed as C(R)
=∇FT
∇F. Finally, the stretching
eldS(x;t)is calculated as the square root of the largest
eigenvalue of C(R)
, where the corresponding eigenvector
gives the principal stretching direction. For all ows,
the stretching history is determined by backward time
integration, and the integration time was chosen as the
uid relaxation time ( =−) [39]. Fwas determined
through numerical integration (ODE45, MATLAB) for
initial positions on a regular grid (251 ×351) along with
four auxiliary points each (1 m separation). ∇Fwas
computed through central dierences of the auxiliary
points.
III. RESULTS
A. Anisotropic Lagrangian transport in porous
media
Flow through hexagonally ordered (staggered) geome-
tries in both experiments and simulations exhibits a tran-
sition to unstable ow at a critical Weissenberg num-
ber [35], Wi cr≈0:5. However, the time-averaged ow
elds do not show a strong topological change with Wi
due to the high degree of geometric symmetry [Fig. 1 (a)].
In contrast, disordered geometries stabilize these ows
via the formation of preferential ow paths [58], whereextensional uid deformations { and consequently poly-
mer stretching { are minimized [35, 37]. Time-averaged
ow elds through disordered media in both experiments
and simulations display a topological shift from a New-
tonian ow [Fig. 1 (a)], where laments form as Wi is
increased and the ow eld becomes more heterogeneous.
As in previous works [35, 37], this Eulerian picture points
to a trade-o between stability and channelization that is
mediated by pore microstructure. However, this frame-
work provides little insight into the eect of geometry on
uid transport.
Turning toward a Lagrangian description of uid trans-
port reveals that lateral and longitudinal tracer displace-
ments are enhanced at high Wi for the ordered and disor-
dered porous geometries, respectively. Particle tracking
provides tracer particle trajectories in time, xi(~t), where
irepresents an individual particle track. The normal-
ized time, ~t=tU/slash.leftl, corresponds to the number of pores
traveled for a given characteristic (mean) ow speed, U,
and stream-wise pore spacing, l=asin 60○. Examination
of the net displacement of the uid tracers with respect
to their initial positions,  xi(~t)=xi(~t)−xi(0), demon-
strates how geometry inuences transport through vis-
coelasticity [Fig. 1 (b)]. Tracers in the ordered geome-
try at small Wi tamely oscillate back and forth, as they
weave through the pillar array following streamlines in
the steady ow. Conversely, at Wi =4>Wicr, tracers
exhibit wild lateral excursions accompanied by a mod-
erate enhancement of longitudinal displacement. The
former is consistent with previous observations of \lane-
changing" [17], which is a consequence of temporal ve-
locity eld uctuations [35]. In the disordered geometry,
tracers laterally explore a relatively large swatch of the
porous channel by virtue of the meandering streamlines
at low Wi, with little change at higher Wi [Fig. 1 (b)].
While the disordered ow remains steady at Wi =4,
tracer displacements are appreciably enhanced in the lon-
gitudinal direction.
The displacement distributions relative to the mean,
xi(t∗)−/uni27E8xi(t∗)/uni27E9, at a xed time ( t∗≡~t=5) more
clearly show the anisotropic enhancement of tracer excur-
sions in both the ordered and disordered systems at high
Wi [Fig. 1 (c)-(d)]. Here, /uni27E8⋅/uni27E9indicates an ensemble aver-
age. The transverse displacement [Fig. 1 (c)] exhibits a
narrow distribution for low Wi in the ordered media (blue
solid) due to the high P eclet number, stable ow. At high
Wi, the ordered media shows large displacements in the
transverse direction (red solid), consistent with the onset
of the elastic instability. Transverse disordered ow, on
the other hand, is generally unaected by increasing Wi
and shows little to no change (blue and red dashed for
low and high Wi, respectively). Surprisingly, longitudi-
nal displacements [Fig. 1 (d)] show the opposite eect as
a function of disorder. Longitudinal displacements in the
ordered system (solid curves) show little change with Wi.
However, the disordered media exhibits a broader tracer
displacement distribution for high Wi (dashed red) than
low Wi (dashed blue). Thus, tracers disperse by trav-4

B. Mean squared displacement analysis reveals
diusive spreading of uid tracers
The variance of the displacement distributions
[Fig. 1 (c)-(d)] denes the advection-free mean squared
displacement (MSD) at time, ~t, which indicate the nature
and rate of spreading of the tracers:
2
T(~t)=/uni27E8.alt2/parenleft.alt1yi(~t)−/uni27E8yi(~t)/uni27E9/parenright.alt12/uni27E9.alt2; (7)

L(~t)=/uni27E8.alt2/parenleft.alt1xi(~t)−/uni27E8xi(~t)/uni27E9/parenright.alt12/uni27E9.alt2: (8)
The MSD describes the average separation of uid parcels
from one another in time due to both the mechanical
dispersion and ow instability in the transverse ( 2
T) and
longitudinal ( 2
L) directions, respectively. The transverse
MSD in the ordered media exhibits oscillations at low Wi
reective of the obstacle periodicity, but the MSD satu-
rates due to the sampling of streamlines with nite am-plitude displacements from the mean ow direction. As
Wi increases and the ow becomes elastically unstable
[Fig. 2 (a), solid curves], the displacements at long times
are unbounded and grow superlinearly in time [Fig. 2 (a),
inset], which is indicative of superdiusive transport (i.e.,
MSD∝twith 1<<2). However, in the disordered
geometry, all transverse MSDs plateau after ≈2−3 pore
lengths and are only mildly aected by Wi [Fig. 2 (a),
dashed curves]. While all transverse MSDs are ballistic
at short times ( ≈2) [Fig. 2 (a), inset], only MSDs for
the transverse, high Wi ordered ow continue growing
superlinearly at long times due to the elastic instabil-
ity. Mechanical dispersion in the ow direction [59, 60]
causes longitudinal MSDs to be unbounded. While all
longitudinal MSDs are superdiusive [Fig. 2 (b), inset],
MSDs for viscoelastic ows grow faster in the disordered
media [Fig. 2 (b), dashed curves] compared to ordered
media [Fig. 2 (b), solid curves], relative to their respec-
tive Newtonian ows.5

C. Dispersion tensor for viscoelastic porous media
ow
The average rate at which a tracer ensemble spreads
is parameterized by the dispersion coecient. In the
present case, due to the observed anisotropic transport,
we examine the time-dependent dispersion tensor [61],
which we compare across experiments and simulations:
DT;L(~t)=/integral.disp~t

Here,CT;L(~t)is the time-dependent velocity autocovari-
ance that quanties the temporal correlation of tracervelocity:

where theuyi(~t)anduxi(~t)are respectively the trans-
verse and longitudinal velocity components of particle
i, and/uni27E8⋅/uni27E9is an ensemble average over Nparticles. The
transverse autocovariance is periodic about zero in the or-
dered geometry, but the oscillations lose coherence with
the onset of the instability as Wi increases. However, as
the instability drives lane changing, transverse particle
velocities gain a slight net correlation due to the motion
over one or more pores lateral to the ow. For disor-
dered ow, CTrapidly decays and appears to have little6
dependence on Wi [Fig. 2 (c)], due to the random un-
correlated ow paths through the medium. Similar to
the transverse direction, the longitudinal autocovariance
for ordered ow exhibits periodic peaks that lose coher-
ence as Wi increases [Fig. 2 (d)], due to the onset of
spatiotemporal velocity uctuations. Conversely, CLfor
disordered ow shows an increase in the correlation time
beyond a Newtonian uid as Wi is increased. This in-
creased velocity correlation stems from the formation of
preferential ow paths that transport uid in the longitu-
dinal direction [35], which we expect to lead to increased
dispersion.
The time-dependent dispersion tensor serves as a pri-
mary measure of augmented anisotropic transport. In
these high P eclet ows, transverse dispersion coe-
cients in both experiments [Fig. 3 (a)] and simulations
[Fig. 3 (b)] either oscillate about zero (ordered) or de-
cay to zero (disordered) for stable ows (Wi /uni2272Wicr). In
experiments, the instability only occurs in the ordered
ow [Fig. 3 (a), solid curves]. However, in simulations,
some velocity uctuations in both ordered and disordered
ows cause nite values of DTat long times and high Wi
[Fig. 3 (b)]. While both geometries ultimately become
unstable in simulations, this eect is more pronounced in
high Wi, ordered ows, indicated by elevated long-time
dispersion [Fig. 3 (b)] compared to the disordered ow.
In the longitudinal direction, DLgrows approximately
linearly for ordered ow at low Wi, but plateaus at high
Wi [Fig. 3 (c), solid curves], indicating an eectively
diusive regime. The linear growth is due to the con-
stant, non-zero autocovariance in steady ows through
the ordered geometry. Once the ow becomes unstable
in experiments (Wi /uni2273Wicr), dispersion values increase
at small times but plateau at long times [Fig. 3 (c), solid
curves] due to decorrelation of observed in CL[Fig. 2 (d),
solid curves]. This eect is also seen in simulations
[Fig. 3 (d), solid curves], but the dispersion coecient
does not reach a constant value in time. In simulations,
we observe far less diagonal ow due to the reduced sys-
tem size compared to experiments. As a result of this cor-
related longitudinal motion, DLdoes not reach a steady
state in simulations. Due to measurement limitations in
experiments, it is unclear when high Wi disordered ow
reaches a steady state [Fig. 3 (c), dashed curves]. How-
ever, the magnitude of dispersion is larger than ordered
ows for the same Wi at all times. This observation also
holds true for simulations [Fig. 3 (d), dashed curves],
whereDLdisordered media is much larger than for or-
dered media and is still growing for long times.
We have systematically quantied the transport prop-
erties and stability of viscoelastic ows through porous
media. These results show that there is a clear trade-o
between rheology-enhanced transport and geometry that
also accompanies the stabilizing eect of preferential ow
paths in the disordered media. These viscoelastic uids
are composed of elastic polymers suspended in a carrier
uid, which stretch dramatically in extensional strain
compared to shear strain [62]. Polymer elasticity em-beds a memory into the uid, whereby polymers continue
to stretch and accumulate stress as they move through
both space and time via advection. Flow through the
staggered ordered media becomes chaotic due to exten-
sional stresses at high Wi, whereas preferential ow paths
can alleviate extension and promote stability in the dis-
ordered media [35, 37]. The topology of the polymeric
stress eld has been known to regulate ow states in vis-
coelastic ows [25, 27, 28, 63]. Polymeric stress is thus
integral to both enhanced transport and elastic stabil-
ity in these systems, but access to the polymeric stress
eld in experiments is challenging [64]. Recently, a La-
grangian analysis of uid deformation was demonstrated
to provide direct insight into the topology of the poly-
meric stress eld from readily measurable ow eld data
[39], which is a key to the comprehensive understanding
of the transport in these systems.
D. Lagrangian stretching guides uid ow
Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) [54] characterize
material lines that organize uid transport, which have
been applied broadly across scales to understand ocean
ow patterns, chaotic mixing [55], bacterial transport
ows [57], and complex uid ows [39]. Key to LCS anal-
ysis is the concept of the Lagrangian uid stretching eld,
which quanties the extensional strain history of uid el-
ements and is closely linked to the nite-time Lyapunov
exponent (FTLE) eld. Manifolds of the stretching eld
act as barriers to advective transport, and recently, were
shown to be highly correlated with the topology of the
polymeric stress eld in viscoelastic ows [39]. Thus, the
Lagrangian stretching could potentially provide a direct
link between the polymer stress and dispersion for the
viscoelastic porous media ows considered here.
Lagrangian stretching elds, S(x;t), were calculated
directly from both the experimentally measured and sim-
ulated velocity elds (see Methods) [39, 54, 56, 57]. The
viscoelastic uid relaxation time, , was chosen as a nat-
ural integration time over which the stretching history
was computed for all Wi. Stretching elds for both the
ordered and disordered media [Fig. 4 (a)] reveal sharp
regions of high stretching (manifolds) that generally em-
anate from the hyperbolic ow regions on the down-
stream sides of the pillars including unsteady ow con-
ditions [Fig. 4 (e)]. Importantly, simulations also pro-
vide the time-dependent stress tensor, (x;t), and en-
able direct comparison with the Lagrangian stretching
[Fig. 4 (b)]. In line with recent work [39], the trace of the
polymeric stress tensor [Fig. 4 (b)] mirrors the topology
of the stretching manifolds [Fig. 4 (a)] for both ordered
and disordered ow simulations. To quantify the correla-
tion between the topologies of stress and stretching elds,
the cross-correlation is dened as:

where/uni27E8⋅/uni27E9denotes the mean value over all x, andxis
the shifted position. Large values of  indicate large
values for both tr ()andS. The strongest correlation
occurs forx=0 due to the overlap of the lamentous
stretching and stress elds [Fig. 4 (c)], which is indicated
by the elongated features of  for the ordered media in
the longitudinal direction. Examining the magnitude of
the cross-correlation in the ow direction ( x) shows that
the strength of the of  initially increases with Wi before
diminishing at larger Wi [Fig. 4 (d)], likely due to the
onset of strong temporal uctuations.
The concordance between Lagrangian stretching and
stress demonstrated by simulations provides insight into
the role of stress in dispersive transport for viscoelastic
ow experiments in porous media [39]. In experiments for
ordered media, enhanced transverse dispersion is driven
by elastic instability. The accompanying mobility of
stretching manifolds [Fig. 4 (e)] { which act as barriers
to advective transport { eectively guide the local ow.
A time series of stretching elds from ordered experi-
ments at high Wi shows that stretching manifolds spanthe pillar array in the longitudinal direction. Their lat-
eral uctuations in the transverse direction illustrate the
mechanism of lane-changing [17] in enhanced transverse
dispersion. Conversely, stable ows in disordered media
at high Wi disallow transverse material ux. In this case,
stretching manifolds elongate as Wi increases and cut o
regions of locally high pillar density [Fig. 4 (a)]. The
stretching manifolds thus enhance longitudinal transport
by acting as a conduit through the porous media. In
sum, instability in ordered media allows these stretching
manifolds to mobilize, whereas the stability in disordered
media forces the stretching manifolds, and therefore the
stress, to cut o regions of ow that were previously avail-
able at low Wi.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we quantify dispersion in viscoelastic ow
through porous media and show how it is driven by vis-
coelastic instabilities. Flow through hexagonally-ordered8

(staggered) porous media enhances transverse dispersion,
which is especially prevalent at high Weissenberg num-
ber. Through a novel Lagrangian analysis of uid stretch-
ing elds, we illustrate that this phenomenon is regu-
lated by stretching manifolds that act as barriers to ad-
vective transport and characterize high-stress regions of
the ow. At low Wi, material lines are symmetric, sta-
ble, and situated between obstacles parallel to ow, while
at high Wi strong lateral uctuations guide lateral dis-
persion. Conversely, high Wi ows in disordered porous
media remain stable, as previously shown, due to the re-
duction of extension and the availability of preferential
ow paths [35, 37]. This ow stability is reected in sta-
ble stretching manifolds that disallow random transverse
ows. Stretching manifolds also increase spatial ow
speed heterogeneity by cordoning o slow ow regionsas the stretching manifolds elongate with increasing Wi.
This feature results in dead zones between high-speed l-
aments, where ow is carried longitudinally at disparate
respective rates. Thus, these results show that a La-
grangian examination of uid stretching is essential to
gain insight into the coupling between uid transport and
stress through mechanical uid instability in viscoelastic
porous media ows.
