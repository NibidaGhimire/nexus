The Jet Emitting Disk - Standard Accretion Disk (JED-SAD) is a spectral model
stemming from self similar accretion-ejection solutions. It is composed of an inner
highlymagnetizedandhotaccretionflowlaunchingjets,theJED,andanouterSAD.
The model has been successfully applied to X-ray binaries outbursts. The AGN UV
X-ray correlation represent another essential test for the JED-SAD model. We use
multiple AGN samples to explore the parameter space and identify the regions able
to reproduce the observations. In this first paper, we show that JED-SAD model is
able to reproduce the UV–X-ray correlation.

1INTRODUCTION
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host super-massive accreting
black holes. They are commonly believed to be powered by
anopticallythick,geometricallythinaccretiondiskthatemits
in the optical and UV energy range (Shakura & Sunyaev,
1973). Some, however, also present hard X-ray emission that
is generally assumed to result from the disk photons Comp-
tonscatteringoffthermalelectronsintheso-calledhotcorona,
locatedsomewhereneartheblackhole.Fromthespectrumwe
can extract a few characteristics of this hot corona: electron
temperature around or below 100 keV ( 𝑘𝑇𝑒∼100 keV) and
optical depth of a few ( 𝜏∼ 1) (Gierlinski et al., 1997; Wilms,
Nowak, Pottschmidt, Pooley, & Fritz, 2006; Zdziarski et al.,
1998). A majority of AGN also present a soft X-ray excess,
below2keV,withrespecttothehigh-energypower-lawextrap-
olation (Bianchi, Guainazzi, Matt, Fonseca Bonilla, & Ponti,
2009; Gierliński & Done, 2004; Walter & Fink, 1993).
Many questions still remains open. For instance, the
nature of the hot corona is still highly debated. Does the hot

Standard Accretion Diskcorona stand above the black hole and illuminates the disk as
the lamppost model proposed (e.g. Dauser, Garcia, Parker,
Fabian, and Wilms 2014) ? Or is the corona part of the accre-
tion flow itself as an optically thin and hot flow present in the
innerregionofthedisk(e.g.ThorneandPrice1975;Ferreira,
Petrucci,Henri,Saugé,andPelletier2006;Marceletal.2019;
Zdziarski, Dziełak, De Marco, Szanecki, and Niedźwiecki
2021) ?
The non-linear correlation between the UV and X-ray
monochromatic luminosities taken at 2500 Å and 2 keV is of
particularinterest(Liuetal.,2021;Lussoetal.,2010;Lusso&
Risaliti,2016;Lussoetal.,2020;Risaliti&Lusso,2015;Zhu
et al., 2020). Indeed, this correlation links the emission of the
disk and the emission of the hot corona, thus representing an
excellent test for any given supermassive black hole accretion
model.
Multiple recent studies have proposed theoretical expla-
nation for the non-linearity of this correlation. For instance,
Kubota and Done (2018) developed a broadband spectral
model for bright luminous quasars using three different
regions, an outer cold disk, a warm comptonizing region, inarXiv:2305.13695v1  [astro-ph.HE]  23 May 20232 Barnier ET AL
the middle, producing the soft X-ray excess observed in most
AGN, and a hot corona somewhere close to the black hole.
The hot corona is fixed in the inner region of the accretion
flow.Theydefinethusfourdifferentradii,theISCO,theouter
radius of the hot corona and the outer radius of the warm
corona,andtheouterradiusoftheaccretionflow.Theytiethe
different regions energetically assuming a Novikov-Thorne
emissivity. They fit the data from three AGN with different
spectral shape akin to a hard, an intermediate and a close
to soft X-ray binaries accretion states. Even though these
AGN had different mass accretion rate, the luminosity of the
hot corona region is always close to 2% Eddington. By fix-
ing the power in the corona to 2% Eddington, the geometry
(the three radii) can then be recovered from the value of the
mass accretion rate and black hole mass. Using this model,
they partially cover the UV–X-ray correlation. They however
had difficulties to reproduce large UV/X-ray ratios and the
highest luminosity objects of the sample from Lusso and
Risaliti (2017). Arcodia, Merloni, Nandra, and Ponti (2019)
developed a disk model where the corona extends above the
standard disk. The disk pressure can be locally dominated
by the gas pressure or by the radiation pressure. Assuming a
general formula: 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑔∝𝑃𝜇
𝑔𝑎𝑠𝑃1−𝜇
𝑡𝑜𝑡with the power-law index
𝜇taking values between 0 and 1 depending on the alternative
viscosityprescription,theycanplaywithdifferentdisk-corona
energetic couplings. In the more luminous inner regions,
where the radiation pressure dominates, the alternative vis-
cosity decreases the power in the corona and the X-ray output
decreases. Varying the mass accretion rate increases the size
of this radiation pressure dominated region, decreasing the
spectraloutputofcolderregionsandthusdecreasingtheslope
of the UV–X-ray correlation. They study the impact of the
parameters𝜇on the slope in the UV–X-ray correlation when
the mass accretion rate increase. They found that the slope of
the UV–X-ray correlation is best reproduced with a viscosity
prescription 𝜇∼ 0.5.
This paper is a first in a series presenting the application of
the jet emitting disk standard accretion disk (JED-SAD, Fer-
reiraetal.2006)modeltotheUV–X-raycorrelationobserved

tiple X-ray binaries outbursts, successfully explaining andreproducing their outbursts using the two main parameters,

al. 2021), applications to AGN are scarce (HE1143 in Ursini
et al. 2020). In the JED-SAD model, the disk and hot corona
emissions are computed in a physically motivated configura-
tion, thus, to intensively test the model on AGN, we aim to

emission coming from the JED. The two vertical dashed lines show the energy at which the monochromatic luminosity in the

the UV luminosity can be measured either within the Wien
function of the blackbody or even within the JED emission in
very cold disk. As such, except as long as the disk is not very
cold, the monochromatic luminosity is analytical. The 2 keV
monochromaticluminosityishoweveralwaysmeasuredwithin
the optically thin JED and one must thus solve the thermal
equilibrium to get the X-ray monochromatic luminosity.
3SAMPLES
We selected three samples as reference to compare to our
simulations.
Lusso & Risaliti
TheLusso&Risalitisampleistheresultofanextensiveeffort
to compile an as unbiased as possible AGN sample to study
the UV–X-ray correlation with the redshift (e.g. Lusso et al.
2010;LussoandRisaliti2016,2017;Lussoetal.2020;Risal-
iti and Lusso 2015, 2019). They use this correlation to show
thatquasarscanbeusedasstandardcandleforcosmology.We
will focus on the latest sample (Lusso et al., 2020). The sam-
ple consists of 2421 radio-quiet, unabsorbed, bright quasars.
They report a correlation 𝐿2𝑘𝑒𝑉∝𝐿2500Å𝛾with index𝛾=
0.586±0.061.Infig.3 ,weplotthedistributionofthesample
in blue.
One might question the choice of this radio-quiet sample
to test the JED-SAD model. Indeed, in the JED-SAD model,we expect the presence of jets which are generally considered
as the source of radio emission. However, the nature of the
weak radio emission within the radio-quiet population is still
highly debated (see review in Panessa et al. 2019). Four main
scenario are discussed: 1) Radio emission can originate from
a strong star formation rate within the host galaxy (Orienti,
D’Ammando,Giroletti,Giovannini,&Panessa,2015;Sargent
etal.,2010).2)Theradioemissioncancomefromnon-thermal
particle accelerated within the magnetised hot corona (e.g.
Inoue and Doi 2018; Inoue, Khangulyan, and Doi 2021; Laor
and Behar 2008). 3) Massive winds emitted from the accre-
tion flow can also produce radio emission (see for instance
Hwang et al. 2018; Mullaney et al. 2013; Nims, Quataert,
and Faucher-Giguère 2015; Zakamska and Greene 2014). 4)
Finally, the presence of jetted structure has been observed in
a few optically selected local AGN (Leipski, Falcke, Bennert,
and Hüttemeister 2006; Middelberg et al. 2004; Roy, Wilson,
Ulvestad,andColbert2000).Assuch,theJED-SADmodelcan
still be relevant to understand a radio-quiet AGN sample.
Zhu et al.
In Zhu et al. (2020), they collected 729 radio loud quasars in
order to compare the disk-corona connection obtained for a

Liu et al.
Liu et al. (2021) collected 47 AGN with different accretion
properties. 21 of them present a super Eddington accretion
regime. 26 of them present a sub Eddington regime. They
report no difference in correlation between these two pop-
ulations. In fig. 3 , we plot the distribution of the sample
in orange. This sample reaches 2 orders of magnitude lower
compared to the Lusso &Risaliti sample.
4RESULTS AND PROSPECTS
We produce spectra along a grid of the two main parameters
𝑟𝐽anḋ 𝑚. This grid is build using a logarithmic scale, with
𝑟𝐽varying from 2.1 to 100 and of ̇ 𝑚from 10−2to10. The
other JED-SAD parameters are fixed to: 𝑚= 109;𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑜= 2;
𝜔= 0.1;𝑚𝑠= 1.5;𝑏= 0.3;𝑝= 0.01. In Fig. 4 , we plot the
grid from the simulated AGN JED-SAD spectra over the 95
and 68 percentiles contours of the different collected samples
assuminga 109M⊙blackholemass.Thepointsconnectedby
a dashed line use the same value of the mass accretion rate
(equi-̇ 𝑚track). We mark the general evolution with 𝑟𝐽anḋ 𝑚
using red arrows. From the bottom left to the top right, the
mass accretion increases, increasing both the UV and X-ray
luminosities. From the bottom right to the left of each equi- ̇ 𝑚
track,thetransitionradiusincreasesfromtheISCO(2here)to
100. Indeed, the smaller the transition radius is and the larger
the energy released in the standard disk becomes, increasing
the UV luminosity.
With this unique grid using a single value of the black hole
mass, we see that the JED-SAD simulations are already able

higher black hole masses, we are able to cover all three com-

is able to reproduce the UV–X-ray correlation. Furthermore,

The next step is to study the impact of the other JED-SAD
parameters presented in Sec. 2. We can then identify the rel-
evant parameter space of the JED-SAD model allowing to
reproduce each of the collected samples and then conclude
on the physical origin of the non linear correlation between
the UV and X-ray emission in AGN samples. This will be
presented in forthcoming papers.
