Abstract
WeextendNguyen’scharacterization of Sobolev spaces W1,p[Ngu06,Ngu08] tothe setting
of PI-metric measure spaces such that at m-a.e. point the tangent space (in the Gromov–
Hausdorﬀ sense) is unique and Euclidean with a ﬁxed dimensio n. We also generalize [ CLL14]
to PI-metric measure spaces such that at m-a.e. point the tangent space is unique and equal
to the Heisenberg group with a ﬁxed homogeneous dimension. T he approach is easier and
completely diﬀerent from the one in [ Ngu06,Ngu08].
1 Introduction
In the early 2000’s the study of fractional s-seminorms gained great interest when Bourgain,
Brezis and Mironescu [ BBM01] on one hand, and Maz’ya and Shaposhnikova [ MS02] on the other,
showed that they can be seen as functionals interpolating between theLp(Rn)-norm and the
W1,p(Rn)-seminorm. More precisely, the following important asymptotic for mulas have been
proved in [ BBM01] and [MS02] respectively: for any p∈(1,∞),s∈(0,1),n∈Nandf∈/uniontext
0<s<1Ws,p(Rn)∩W1,p(Rn) with bounded support, it holds
lim
sր1(1−s)/bardblf/bardblp
Ws,p(Rn)=K/bardblDf/bardblp
Lp(Rn)(BBM)
and
lim

Ws,p(Rn)=L/bardblf/bardblp
Lp(Rn), (MS)
whereK=K(p,n)>0,L=L(p,n)>0 andWs,p(Rn) is deﬁned as the set of Lp(Rn) functions

Later on, several diﬀerent generalizations of these results in Euc lidean spaces were considered: see
e.g. Ponce [ Pon04], Leoni–Spector [ LS14,LS11], Brezis–Nguyen [ BN16a,BN16b,BN17,BN18],
Pinamonti–Vecchi–Squassina [ PSV19], Nguyen–Pinamonti–Vecchi–Squassina [ NPSV20], Brezis–
Van Schaftingen–Yung [ BVSY21b ,BVSY21a ,BSVSY22 ], Maalaoui–Pinamonti[ MP19], Garofalo–
Tralli [GT22], Alonso Ruiz–Baudoin–Chen–Rogers–Shanmugalingam–Teplyaev[ RBC+20], Alonso
Ruiz–Baudoin [ RB23].

Similar results hold for BV spaces [ D´02,Pon04], for magnetic Sobolev spaces [ NPSV20,NS19]
and for the Heisenberg group [ CLL14].
In [Bre02, Remark 6], Brezis suggested generalizing the theory to more gene ral metric measure
spaces (X,d,m). One of the ﬁrst attempts in this direction was given by Di Marino–S quassina
[DS19], who assumed the measure mto be doubling and the space to support a (1 ,p)-Poincar´ e
inequality. They showed, among other results, the following
Theorem 2. Let(X,d,m)be ap-PIspace for some p∈(1,∞). Then, there exist two constants
CL,CU>0, such that for every f∈Lp(X), the following holds:
CLChp(f)≤limsup
ρց0¨
|f(x)−f(y)|>δδp
m(Bd(x,y)(x))d(x,y)pdm(x)dm(y)≤CUChp(f),
whereChp(f)is deﬁned in (8).
Moreover, a closer look at [ DS19] provides the following two theorems. In particular, Theorem
3is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2, which is [ DS19, Theorem 1.5], whereas Theorem 4
is extracted from the proof of [ DS19, Theorem 1.5]. As the second result is not explicitly stated
in [DS19], we add a few lines concerning its proof in Section 3.2.

In this paper we generalize Theorem 1to the context of PI metric measure spaces admitting
unique tangent cone. To be more precise, we consider PI metric mea sure spaces such that their
tangents (in the Gromov–Hausdorﬀsense) for m-a.e.x∈Xareeither Euclidean spaceswith a ﬁxed
dimensionnor the Heisenberg group with a ﬁxed homogeneous dimension Q. This class contains
many relevant examples, for instance closed Riemannian manifolds, w eighted Euclidean spaces
for continuous weights bounded from above and below, RCD(0 ,N) spaces, Ahlfors RCD( K,N)
spaces, RCD( K,N) spaces with ﬁnite measure and the Heisenberg group. Let us explic itly point
out that the proof of Theorem 1deeply relies on some important geometric facts, such as that
any two points can be connected by a line-segment and the uniformit y in every direction of the
unit sphere. Both those facts are precluded in general metric mea sure spaces. For this reason
our proof is completely diﬀerent from the classical one and it resemb les the one, via a blow-up,
used in [ G´ or22] to prove a Bourgain–Brezis–Mironescu type theorem in the metric setting, see
[BPP22,LPZ22].
21.1 Statement of results
Let us now precisely state the main results of this paper. We start s etting the main assumptions
on the space ( X,d,m) (see (12) and (13) for the deﬁnition of the renormalized measures):
Assumption A. We say that a PI space ( X,d,m) satisﬁes Assumption Aif
Tanx(X,d,m) ={(Rn,de,Ln,0)}form-a.e.x∈X (2)
and
∃Θn(m,x):= lim
rց0m(Br(x))
ωnrn∈(0,∞) for m-a.e.x∈X. (3)
Alternatively,
Assumption B. We say that a PI space ( X,d,m) satisﬁes Assumption Bif
Tanx(X,d,m) ={(Hn,dH,L2n+1,0)}form-a.e.x∈X (4)
and
∃Θn(m,x):= lim
rց0m(Br(x))
ωnr2n+2∈(0,∞) for m-a.e.x∈X. (5)
We point out that spaces satisfying Assumption Aaren-rectiﬁable ([ Bat22]). A similar con-
clusion holds for spaces satisfying Assumption B, provided that [ ALDM23 , Conjeture 7.1] holds
true.
Deﬁnition 5. We deﬁne, for n∈Nandp∈(1,∞),
Cn,p:=

{v∈Rn:|v|=1}|e·v|pdHn−1(v)for anye∈Rnwith|v|= 1,

in the case of Assumption B,
whereσis a suitable Radon measure, see the proof of Lemma 14.
We state now the main result of this note. Its proof is deferred to S ection3.2.
Theorem 6. Let(X,d,m)be ap-PIspace for some p∈(1,∞), satisfying either Assumption A
or Assumption B. Letf∈W1,p(X). Then
lim

As far as we know, Theorem 6represents the ﬁrst extension of Theorem 1to a large class of
metric measure spaces and it paves the way to the study of more ge neral functionals in the setting
of metric measure spaces. We remark that the assumption that th e tangent space is in a certain
sense unique is rather sharp, see e.g. [ G´ or22, Example 4.4].
32 Preliminaries
In this section we collect some preliminary notions that we will use thro ughout the paper. We
use standard notation for the functional spaces (e.g. LIP denot es the space of Lipschitz functions)
and we add the subscript bs to denote the subspace of functions w ith bounded support.
Sobolev spaces.
By metric measure space we mean a triplet ( X,d,m), where ( X,d) is a complete and separable
metric space and mis a Borel measure on Xthat is ﬁnite on balls. A pointed metric measure is a
quadruplet ( X,d,m,x), where ( X,d,m) is a metric measure space and x∈X.
Given anyp∈(1,∞), the Cheeger p-energy Ch p(f) of a function f∈Lp(m) is deﬁned as
Chp(f):= inf
(fn)liminf
nˆ
lip(fn)pdm, (8)
where the inﬁmum is taken among all sequences ( fn)n⊆LIPbs(X)∩Lp(m) such that fn→fin
Lp(m). Here, the slope lip( g):X→[0,+∞) ofg∈LIP(X) is
lip(g)(x):= limsup
y→x|g(x)−g(y)|
d(x,y),
where we understand lip( g)(x) = 0 ifxis isolated. The Sobolev space W1,p(X) is deﬁned as
W1,p(X):=/braceleftbig
f∈Lp(m)/vextendsingle/vextendsingleChp(f)<+∞/bracerightbig
.
Givenanyf∈W1,p(X), thereexistsaunique function |Dpf| ∈Lp(m), calledtheminimal p-relaxed
slope off, and the Cheeger p-energy offcan be represented as
Chp(f) =ˆ
|Dpf|pdm.
See [AGS14,AGS13] after [Che99] for more details about the above notions and results. We
stress that |Dpf|, in general, depends on p(however, this does not happen on PI spaces, see e.g.
[ACDM15 , Appendix C] or [ BB11, Theorem A.9]).
PI spaces.
We recall the deﬁnition of the class of PI spaces.
Deﬁnition 7. Let (X,d,m) be a metric measure space. Then:
i) We say that ( X,d,m) is uniformly doubling if there exists a constant CD>0 such that
m(B2r(x))≤CDm(Br(x)) for every x∈Xandr>0. (9)
ii) Forp∈(1,∞), we say that ( X,d,m) supports a (1 ,p)-Poincar´ e inequality if there exists a
constantCP>0 such that
−ˆ
Br(x)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef−−ˆ
Br(x)fdm/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingledm≤CPr/parenleftbigg
−ˆ
Br(x)lip(f)pdm/parenrightbigg1/p
for everyx∈Xandr>0,
wheneverf∈LIPbs(X).
iii) We say that ( X,d,m) is ap-PI space if it is uniformly doubling and it supports a (1 ,p)-
Poincar´ e inequality, i.e. if it satisﬁes items i) and ii) above. If the value ofp∈(1,∞) is not
important, we simply say that ( X,d,m) is a PI space.
4Remark 8.We will often need Lemma 9below, which is taken from [ DS19]. We remind that,
to apply the lemma to a metric measure space ( X,d,m), we need the full doubling condition on
the reference measure, i.e. the existence of some CD>0 satisfying ( 9). In particular, the local
uniform doubling property, that asks that for every R>0 there exists CD(R)>0 such that
m(B2r(x))≤CD(R)m(Br(x)) for every x∈Xandr∈(0,R)
is not suﬃcient for our purposes. This is the reason why we asked th e validity of ( 9) in the
deﬁnition of PI space, even though it is now customary to include in th e class of PI spaces even
spaces that are only locally uniformly doubling. Similar considerations h old for what concerns the
statement of the Poincar´ e inequality, see the assumptions in [ DS19].
Nevertheless, to prove our main Theorem 6, a weaker form of the (1 ,p)-Poincar´ e inequality is
enough: it is enough to ask that there exist a constant λ≥1 and, for any radius R>0, a constant
CP=CP(R)>0, such that
−ˆ
Br(x)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef−−ˆ
Br(x)fdm/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingledm≤CPr/parenleftbigg
−ˆ
Bλr(x)lip(f)pdm/parenrightbigg1/p
for everyx∈Xandr∈(0,R),
wheneverf∈LIPbs(X). This is because the Poincar´ e inequality is only needed to employ the
results of [ Che99] (in [Che99] the standing assumption, besides the doubling condition on the
measures, was this weaker form of the Poincar´ e inequality):
•in the blow-up argument of Lemma 13and Lemma 14, we need the characterization of
blow-ups of Lipschitz functions as generalized linear functions,
•in the proof of Theorem 6, we need the identiﬁcation between local Lipschitz constant and
minimal weak upper gradient, see ( 11) below.
Notice that, however, the uniform doubling condition is still needed t o prove Theorem 6(see the
proof of Proposition 15). /squaresolid

A key property of p-PI spaces, proved in [ Che99], is that

A fundamental concept in the blow-up argument of this note is the p ointed-measured-Gromov–
Hausdorﬀ (pmGH) convergence (see e.g. [ GMS15] and the references therein). Take a sequence/parenleftbig

andιn(xn)→ι∞(x∞). If we have a sequence of functions fn:Xn→R, forn∈N∪ {∞}, we
say thatfnconverges to flocally uniformly (with respect to the realization ( Z,dZ)) if for every
R,ε>0, there exist ¯ n∈Nandδ >0 such that
|fn(x)−f∞(x′)|<εifx′∈BR(x∞)⊆X∞,x∈Xn, wheren≥¯nanddZ(ιn(x),ι∞(x′))<δ.

Given a pointed metric measure space ( X,d,m,x) and a radius r>0, we deﬁne the normalized

The tangent cone Tan x(X,d,m) is then deﬁned as the family of all those pointed metric measure

x∈X. We deﬁne Lnto be the normalized Lebesgue measure, i.e.

whereωn:=Ln(B1(0)).
Heisenberg group
We represent the Heisenberg group Hnas the set Cn×R≡R2n+1; thus its points will be described
asx= (z,t) = (ζ+iη,t) = (ζ,η,t), withz∈Cn,ζ,η∈Rn,t∈R. The group operation on Hn
will be deﬁned as follows: whenever x= (z,t)∈Hnandx′= (z′,t′)∈Hn,
x·x′:=/parenleftbig
z+z′,t+t′+2Im/parenleftbig
/an}bracketle{tz,¯z′/an}bracketri}ht/parenrightbig/parenrightbig
,
where ¯z∈Cdenotes the conjugate of z∈C. As a consequence, it is easy to verify that the group
identity is the origin 0 and the inverse of a point is given by ( z,t)−1= (−z,−t). We also introduce
the following family of non-isotropic dilations , since they are fundamental in the geometry of the
Heisenberg group: if x= (z,t)∈Hnandλ>0,
δλ(x):= (λz,λ2t).
The Heisenberg group Hnadmits the structure of a Lie group of topological dimension 2 n+ 1.
Its Lie algebra hnof left invariant vector ﬁelds is stratiﬁed of step 2 and it is (linearly) g enerated
by (2n+1)−vector ﬁelds X1,...,X n,Y1,...,Y n,T. We recall that an absolutely continuous curve
γ: [a,b]→Hnishorizontal if there exist u1,...,u 2n∈L1[a,b] such that for almost every t∈[a,b]:
γ′(t) =n/summationdisplay
i=1(ui(t)Xi(γ(t))+ui+n(t)Yi(γ(t))).
Deﬁne the horizontal length of such a curve γbyL(γ) =´b
a|u(t)|dt, whereu= (u1,...,u 2n)
and| · |denotes the Euclidean norm on R2n. TheCarnot-Carath´ eodory distance (CC distance)
between points x,y∈Hnis deﬁned by:
dH(x,y) = inf{L(γ) :γ: [0,1]→Hnhorizontal joining xtoy}.
The Chow-Rashevskii Theorem implies that any two points of Hncan be connected by horizontal
curves [BLU07, Theorem 9.1.3]. It follows that the CC distance is indeed a distance on Hn. For
brevity we write /bardblx/bardblinstead ofdH(x,0). It is well known that dHinduces the same topology as
the Euclidean distance but the two are not Lipschitz equivalent.
The Haar measure of the Hnis given by the Lebesgue measure L2n+1. Unless otherwise stated,
when saying that a property holds a.e. on Hn; we will always mean that it holds a.e. with respect
toL2n+1. As in the Euclidean case, we deﬁne L2n+1to be the normalized Lebesgue measure, i.e.
L2n+1=1
ωnL2n+1(13)
whereωn=L2n+1(B1(0)) andB1(0) denotes the unit ball with respect to dH.

We brieﬂy justify this claim. We can put ourselves in a situation in which w e have sequence of
functionsgkthat locallyuniformlyto g∞, whereg∞is Lipschitz. We then extend g∞to aLipschitz
function on ( Z,dZ) that we call g′

Therefore, the claim follows by the weak convergence of mx

δk→0.
By local uniform convergenceof gktog∞and the Lipschitz property of g′

locally uniformly convergesto 0, hence it is enough to show that for e veryτ >0, there exists ¯k∈N
such that for every k≥¯kandy∈Bδk(R+1)(x), there exists y′∈BR+2(0) with dZ(ιk(y),ι∞(y′))<
τ. This is easily proved by contradiction, relying on standard argumen ts.

10Proof.The proof follows verbatim the one of Lemma 13up to some technical details that we
clarify below. As in Lemma 13, up to rescaling, we can assume that fis 1-Lipschitz. Fix any
sequenceδkց0, it is enough to show that we can extract a (non relabelled) subseq uence such
that the limit in ( 16) holds for this subsequence.
Thanks to Gromov compactness Theorem, Arzel` a–Ascoli Theore m and the choice of x(in
particular, ( 4)), we can assume (up to taking a non relabelled subsequence) that
(X,dδk,mx
δk,x):= (X,δ−1
kd,m/m(Bδk(x)),x)→(Hn,dH,L2n+1,0) in the pmGH topology
and thatfk:=δ−1
k(f−f(x)) converge locally uniformly to a linear function Lx:Hn→R, where,
for someζ= (ζ1,...,ζ 2n,0) with (ζ1,...,ζ 2n)∈S2n−1,
Lx(y) = lip(f)(x)(y·ζ) for every y∈Hn
(see[G´ or22, Theorem4.2]). Following( 18)and(19) oftheproofofLemma 13(herethe assumption
(5) comes into play), we reduce ourselves to compute the limit of

k
d(x,y)2n+2m(Bδk(x))δp

Hence, employing the same computations as in the proof of Lemma 13, we are left to compute

whereQ:= 2n+2. Now, if lip( f)(x)/ne}ationslash= 0, we perform the change of variables z=δlip(f)(x)yand
we see that

Application of the blow-up argument
Proposition 15. Let(X,d,m)be aPIspace satisfying either Assumption Aor Assumption B.
Letf∈LIPbs(X). Then, for every p∈(1,∞),
lim
δց0Iδ(f) =Cn,p
pωnˆ
Xlip(f)pdm, (26)
whereCn,pis as in Deﬁnition 5.
11Proof.We letC >0 denote a constant that depends only ( X,d,m) and may vary during the proof.
By scaling, we can assume that fis 1-Lipschitz, so that, by ( 10), for every x∈X,
ˆ
Xχ{|f(x)−f(y)|>δ}(x,y)δp
m(Bd(x,y)(x))d(x,y)pdm(y)

Fix ¯x∈Xand ¯r>0suchthatthe supportof fiscontainedin ˆB1:=B¯r(¯x), letalso ˆB2:=B¯r+1(¯x).
Now we compute, taking into account that if x /∈ˆB2andy /∈ˆB1thenf(x) =f(y) = 0, by
Fubini,

where the last inequality is due to ( 10).
Also, by ( 27) we can use dominated convergence together with ( 16) of Lemma 13or (25) of
Lemma14to infer that

Therefore, ( 26) follows from ( 28) and (29).
Remark 16.It is worth noticing that Lemma 13and Proposition 15hold also in “local version”,
i.e. integrating on an open set Ω ⊆X, with the same proof. For example, if ( X,d,m) is a PI space
satisfying Assumption A, Ω⊆Xis open and f∈LIPbs(X), then, for every p∈(1,∞),

3.2 Proof of the main results
We recall ﬁrst the deﬁnition of the functionals IδandJδin Deﬁnition 10.
Proof of Theorem 4.Assume ﬁrst f∈W1,p(X). Then by Theorem 3it holds that
sup
δ∈(0,1)Iδ(f)<∞.
We can then take the supremum for ε∈(0,1) in (15) of and prove the claim.
Conversely, assume that
sup
δ∈(0,1)¨
|f(x)−f(y)|≤1δ|f(x)−f(y)|p+δ
m(Bd(x,y)(x))d(x,y)pdm(y)dm(x)<∞
12and that ¨
|f(x)−f(y)|>11
m(Bd(x,y)(x))d(x,y)pdm(y)dm(x)<∞.
Therefore,
sup
δ∈(0,1)¨
X×Xδ(|f(x)−f(y)|∧1)p+δ
m(Bd(x,y)(x))d(x,y)pdm(y)dm(x)<∞,
so that we can follow [ DS19, proof of the lower bound of Theorem 1.5] and conclude that f∈
W1,p(X).
Proof of Theorem 6.With Proposition 15and Theorem 2in mind, the proof is not so diﬀerent
from the one of [ NPSV18, Proposition 3.3]. By [ ACDM15 ] (and an immediate approximation
argument), we have a sequence ( fl)l⊆LIPbs(X) withfl→finW1,p(X). We use ( 14) of Lemma
11to infer that for every l, for everyδ,ε∈(0,1),
Iδ(f)≤1
εpIεδ(f−fl)+1
(1−ε)pI(1−ε)δ(fl). (30)
Therefore, using ( 26) of Proposition 15and Theorem 2(there the deﬁnition of CU)
limsup
δց0Iδ(f)≤CU
εpChp(f−fl)+1
(1−ε)pCn,p
pωnChp(fl),
as the limsup is subadditive. We now let l→ ∞to infer that
limsup
δց0Iδ(f)≤1
(1−ε)pCn,p
pωnChp(f)
and then we let εց0 to infer
limsup
δց0Iδ(f)≤Cn,p
pωnChp(f). (31)
Exchanging the roles of fandflin (30),
Iδ(fl)−1
εpIεδ(f−fl)≤1
(1−ε)pI(1−ε)δ(f),
so that, again by ( 26) of Proposition 15and Theorem 2(there the deﬁnition of CU),
Cn,p
pωnChp(fl)−CU
εpChp(f−fl)≤1
(1−ε)pliminf
δց0Iδ(f),
as the liminf is superadditive. Again, we let l→ ∞to infer that
Cn,p
pωnChp(f)≤1
(1−ε)pliminf
δց0Iδ(f)
and then we let εց0 to infer that
Cn,p
pωnChp(f)≤liminf
δց0Iδ(f). (32)
Therefore, ( 6) follows from ( 31) and (32). Also, we can use ( 6) to letεց0 in (15) and deduce
(7).
