Abstract
Matrixconﬁgurationscomingfrommatrixmodelscomprisemanyimportantaspectsofmodern
physics. They represent special quantum spaces and are thus strongly related to noncommutative
geometry. In order to establish a semiclassical limit that allows to extract their intuitive geomet-
rical content, this thesis analyzes and reﬁnes an approach that associates a classical geometry to
a given matrix conﬁguration, based on quasi-coherent states.
While, so far, the approach is only well understood for very speciﬁc cases, in this work it is
reviewed and implemented on a computer, allowing the numerical investigation of deformations
of these cases. It is proven that the classical space can be made into a smooth manifold immersed
into complex projective space. Further, the necessity for the consideration of foliations thereof is
showninordertodealwiththeobservedandsubsequentlydescribedphenomenoncalledoxidation.
The developed numerical methods allow the visualization of the semiclassical limit as well as
quantitative calculations. Explicit examples suggest the stability under perturbations of the
reﬁned approach and highlight the physical interpretation of the construction. All this supports
a better understanding of the geometrical content of arbitrary matrix conﬁgurations as well as
their classical interpretation and establishes the determination of important quantities.
Zusammenfassung
Matrix-Konﬁgurationen als Lösungen von Matrixmodellen beinhalten viele wichtige Aspek-
te der modernen Physik. Sie repräsentieren spezielle Quantenräume und sind daher eng mit der
nichtkommutativen Geometrie verbunden. Um einen semiklassischen Grenzfall ebendieser zu ﬁn-
den und um die darin beschriebene Geometrie zu extrahieren, wird in dieser Arbeit eine spezielle
Konstruktion analysiert und verfeinert, die, basierend auf quasi-kohärenten Zuständen, einer ge-
gebenen Matrix-Konﬁguration eine klassische Geometrie zuordnet.
Die Konstruktion ist nur in speziellen Fällen wirklich verstanden, daher wird diese hier dis-
kutiert und auf einem Computer implementiert, was die numerische Untersuchung von Defor-
mationen dieser Fälle erlaubt. Es wird bewiesen, dass aus der klassischen Geometrie eine glatte
Mannigfaltigkeit, die in den komplexen projektiven Raum immersiert ist, gemacht werden kann.
Weiters wird die Notwendigkeit zur Betrachtung von Blätterungen dieser Mannigfaltigkeit gezeigt,
um das beobachtete und beschriebene Phänomen der Oxidierung handhaben zu können. Die ent-
wickelten numerischen Methoden erlauben es, den semiklassischen Grenzfall zu visualisieren und
quantitative Berechnungen durchzuführen. Explizite Beispiele belegen die Stabilität des verfeiner-
ten Zugangs unter Störungen und verdeutlichen die physikalische Interpretation der Konstruktion.
All dies unterstützt ein besseres Verständnis der beschriebenen Geometrie sowie der klassischen
Interpretation und erlaubt die Berechnung wichtiger Größen.Contents

61 Introduction
Matrix conﬁgurations – reﬁned quantum geometries – are extremely simple objects from a technical
point of view. As solutions of matrix models, they can carry a lot of physical information, while their
geometrical content is not directly accessible. They are inherently described as quantum theories,
which is clearly favorable from a conceptual perspective, but coming to the price that a classical
understanding is diﬃcult. Therefore it is especially desirable to have the ability to construct a semi-
classical limit, represented by a classical manifold with additional structure.
One possibility to construct such a limit is inspired by ordinary quantum mechanics. There, coherent
states allow one to deﬁne quantization maps which build the bridge between classical manifolds and
quantum geometries. Paralleling this mechanism, one associates so called quasi-coherent states to
arbitrary ﬁnite dimensional matrix conﬁgurations. Their collections can be used to deﬁne associated
manifolds.
This construction is well understood for (quantum) geometries associated to compact semisimple Lie
groups with the fuzzy sphere as a prototypical example, but in the general case very little is known.
This motivates the scope of this thesis, that is, to reﬁne the construction of a semiclassical limit via
quasi-coherent states – allowing one to extract the geometrical content of a matrix conﬁguration –
and to study this limit for deformed quantum geometries, being perturbations to well known matrix
conﬁgurations.
An important aspect is the analytic study and the local and global visualization of the associated
manifolds as well as the evaluation of the approach based on quasi-coherent states away from over-
simpliﬁed examples. This further includes the investigation on the stability of the framework under
perturbations as well as quantitative veriﬁcation (here, the focus lies on properties of the quantization
map proposed in [1]).
This thesis is organized in three parts, where the ﬁrst part focuses on the theoretical background
and analytic results, while the second part is dedicated to the implementation of the framework on a
computer. The third part then discusses actual numerical results.
The ﬁrst part (section 2) assumes a working knowledge in Lie theory and diﬀerential geometry, thus
well established results are expected to be known. On the other hand, the more involved discussions
can mostly be skipped, without foreclosing the comprehension of the argumentation. It is divided
in four sections, where the ﬁrst (section 2.1) features an introductory view on quantum spaces and
quantization itself, including important examples like the Moyal-Weyl quantum plane and the fuzzy
sphere. Then section 2.2 focuses on quantum spaces coming from matrix conﬁgurations and espe-
cially on the construction of their semiclassical limit in terms of a so called quantum manifold . Some
examples are discussed in section 2.3, making the connection between earlier examples of quantum
geometries and the numerical investigation in the subsequent part. Section 2.4 introduces diﬀerent
approaches to foliations of the quantum manifold, reﬁning the latter in order to maintain stability
under perturbations.
The second part (section 3) discusses the algorithms that are used for actual calculations in Mathe-
matica, while the focus rather lies on a conceptual understanding than on the actual code, thus not
much knowledge in programming is necessary. In section 3.1 the quasi-coherent states and other basic
properties are calculated, followed by the visualization of the quantum manifold in section 3.2. Section
3.3 deals with calculations in the leaves (coming from the foliations from section 2.4), including the
integration over the latter.
The ﬁnal part (section 4) is reserved for the discussion of actual results for important matrix conﬁg-
7urations. These examples are the squashed fuzzy sphere (section 4.1), the (with random matrices)
perturbed fuzzy sphere (section 4.2), the squashed fuzzy CP2(section 4.3), the related completely
squashed fuzzy CP2(section 4.4) and the fuzzy torus (section 4.5).
Further, this thesis includes three appendices, where appendix A contains the more technical aspects
related to the quasi-coherent states for which there was no place in section 2.2. Appendix B collects
the most crucial facts about the irreducible representations of the Lie algebras su(2)and su(3)as well
as the clock and shift matrices, where the ﬁrst two play an important role throughout this thesis.
The last (appendix C) shows the explicit computations related to the perturbative calculations for
the squashed fuzzy sphere.
The most important paper for this thesis is [1], where a particular construction of the quasi-coherent
states and (based on that) of a semiclassical limit has been introduced that will be used throughout
this work. Thus section 2.2 recapitulates some of the framework and the results – stipulated with new
ﬁndings and additional considerations.
An introductory account to the background and theory of quantum spaces and matrix models can
be found in the lecture notes [2], while a comprehensive introduction in form of a book by Harold C.
Steinacker is in progress (some preliminary material has strongly inﬂuenced section 2.1 and especially
both discussions of coadjoint orbits 2.1.3 and 2.3.4 as well as the introduction to section 2).
In [3, 4] a diﬀerent method to construct quasi-coherent states, based on a Laplacian or Dirac operator,
is discussed. This carries the possibility to compare some results.
The origins of the generalization of coherent states to semisimple Lie algebras lie in [5], while the
fuzzy sphere was ﬁrst described in [6]. Some completely squashed quantum geometries have already
been studied in [7, 3, 4].
General results on matrix models that highlight their physical importance can for example be found
in [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], reaching from emergent gravity to noncommutative quantum ﬁeld theory. An
important matrix model is given by the so called IKKT model, introduced in [14]. In accordance with
its strong relation to type IIB string theory here a semiclassical limit acquires the interpretation as a
brane in target space [8, 1, 14].
In this thesis, an accessible semiclassical limit for arbitrary matrix conﬁgurations is described as a
reﬁnement of the construction from [1], which allows for a better understanding of the geometry
encoded in these.
82 Quantum Matrix Geometries
Thematrix conﬁgurations that we will consider in this section are deﬁned in terms of extraordinarily
simple objects – then again it is far from obvious how to extract any geometrical information from
them.
They are formulated in so called quantum spaces (which are here described as noncommutative geome-
triesvia noncommutative algebras) which are usually thought of as quantizations ofclassical spaces
(i.e. Poisson or symplectic manifolds with their commutative algebras of functions).
At ﬁrst, one attempts to construct quantum spaces associated to classical spaces together with a
correspondence principle implemented as quantization maps (one then says that one quantized the
classical spaces). But if one wants to consider matrix conﬁgurations coming from matrix models as
fundamental, the task is to ﬁnd classical spaces together with quantization maps as semiclassical limits
in such a way that the quantum spaces are the quantizations of the classical spaces. Deﬁning such a
construction is the purpose of this section.
Since a basic understanding of the quantization of Poisson or symplectic manifolds is necessary, the
here used procedures are reviewed in section 2.1, together with some of the basic examples that will
frequently reappear throughout this work, based on [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10].
Havingthatbackground, insection2.2matrixconﬁgurationsareintroducedasspecialtuplesofHermi-
tian matrices (whereas matrix models are actions upon matrix conﬁgurations) without going too deep
into their origins. Following [1], a procedure for ﬁnding a corresponding classical manifold (together
with additional geometrical structure) – relying on so called quasi-coherent states – is introduced.
In section 2.4 a main problem of the previous procedure – the latter constructed manifolds are often
too high dimensional – is tackled via diﬀerent foliation prescriptions, mostly relying on the diﬀerent
geometrical structures.
Finally, some of the developed concepts are applied to basic examples of matrix conﬁgurations (re-
producing some of the examples discussed in section 2.1).
2.1 Quantization of Classical Spaces and Quantum Geometries
There are various approaches to noncommutative geometry and the quantization of Poisson orsym-
plectic manifolds (like the spectral triple [15] or deformation quantization based on formal star prod-
ucts [16]), yet here we follow a diﬀerent (although related) approach.
We ﬁrst look at the classical space, deﬁned in terms of a Poisson manifold (M;f;g). This means
Mis a smooth manifold, coming with its commutative algebra of smooth functions C1(M)(under
point wise multiplication), where we will drop the 1from now on. The manifold is equipped with
aPoisson bracket – an antisymmetric and bilinear map f;g:C(M)C(M)!C(M), satisfying the
Leibniz rule and the Jacobi identity1, makingC(M)into a Lie algebra [17]. We can simply extend
the algebra of functions by allowing the latter to attain complex values. If we demand the bracket
to be complex bilinear it also extends naturally. From now on, this extension is assumed and C(M)
stands for the complex algebra of smooth (yet not holomorphic) complex valued functions on M.
Alternatively, we can start with a symplectic Manifold (M;!)where!2
2(M)is a nondegenerate
two form that is closed d!= 0, calledsymplectic form . Then, there is a naturally induced Poisson

1(M)and X(M), deﬁned via !(];) =()82
1(M);2X(M). Conversely, any Poisson
manifold decomposes into a foliation of symplectic leaves, thus symplectic manifolds are special cases
of Poisson manifolds [17].
While the latter algebra is commutative, we take as a model of a quantum space an (in general)
noncommutative endomorphism algebra End(H)of a Hilbert space H, coming with the commutator
as a natural Lie bracket [;] : End(H)End(H)!End(H). This map is antisymmetric, complex
bilinear and satisﬁes a relation parallel to the Leibniz rule and the Jacobi identity2.
The function algebras equipped with Poisson brackets and the endomorphism algebras provide many
comparable operations and objects with physical interpretation. Table 1 provides a list of related
structures. For example on the classical side we can construct the L2inner product if the manifold
is compact, whereas on the quantum side the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product is naturally available for
ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Similarly, real functions respectively Hermitian operators may be
interpreted as observables. If they are also positive and normalized in the respective induced norms,
they may be regarded as mixed states [1, 3].

Now,quantizing a Poisson manifold means to ﬁrst ﬁnd an appropriate Hilbert space and then relating
algebra elements and especially classical observables to quantum observables in such a way that at
least some features are preserved. Here, this is done by a quantization map .
A quantization map is deﬁned as a (complex) linear map
Q:C(M)!End(H) (1)
that further depends on a parameter calledquantization parameter4and satisﬁes the following
axioms:

The ﬁrst condition ensures that totally mixed states are mapped to totally mixed states (up to
normalization), while the second condition guarantees that observables are mapped to observables.
The third condition ensures compatibility of multiplications and brackets in the two algebras at least
in thesemiclassical limit !0. The last condition ensures that there are no sectors of End(H)that
are left invariant under the adjoint action of the quantization of C(M)and thereforeHis onlyas large
as necessary .
There are further axioms that may be imposed. Naturally, we might demand
5.hQ(f)jQ(g)iHS=hfjgi2(isometry)
meaning that Qis anisometry under the natural inner products. If both C(M)andEnd(H)are
representations of some Lie algebra gwith both actions denoted by , we can further impose
6.Q(xf) =xQ(f)(intertwiner of action)
meaning that Qis anintertwiner of the action [2, 4, 16].
Let us formulate two remarks. Since the dynamics of classical or quantum systems are governed by
the Hamilton equations in terms of the brackets with a Hamiltonian that itself is an observable, Q
can be said to represent the correspondence principle .

Under these actions, we ﬁnd txa=xa+ta(the function xanot a point in R2n) as well as tXa=
Xa+ta1Hso both observables transform in a comparable way under translations, giving them a
related interpretation.
We note further that this implies that the Poisson bracket is invariant under translations.
Now, we deﬁne the so called plain waves vk2C(M)via
vk(x) := exp(iX
akaxa) (7)
and the corresponding quantum version Vk2End(H)via
Vk:= exp(iX
akaXa): (8)
Then, we directly ﬁnd tvk= exp(iP
akata)vkand again via the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ formula
tVk= exp(iP
akata)Vk, thus both transform identically under the translation group as common
eigenmodes of all translations. It is further obvious that the vkform a basis ofC(M).
With this at hand, we deﬁne the quantization map to be the unique linear map satisfying
Q(vk) =Vk; (9)
for allk2R2n. It is not hard to verify that all axioms (1-6) are satisﬁed and Qis a quantization map
– in fact the additional axioms (5) and (6) even make Qunique.
Further this implies
Q(xa1xa) =X(a1Xan); (10)

122.1.2 The Fuzzy Sphere
Now, we turn to a quantum analogue of the sphere S2, thefuzzy sphere . This represents the proto-
typical compact quantum space.
Of course, we pick M=S2,!R3, where we have the Cartesian embedding functions (xa) :S2!R3,
satisfyingP
axaxa= 1M. Further, we deﬁne a Poisson bracket via

On the other hand, we set H=CN, observing the scheme: A compact (noncompact) classical space
ﬁts to a ﬁnite (inﬁnite) quantum space. Such a link is highly plausible in the light of the combination
of axiom (1) and (5).
At this point a little ad hoc7, we introduce the operators Xa:=1

The appearance of SU(2)and consequently SO(3)=SU(2)=f1gin the last deﬁnition is not acci-
dental: WhileS2is exactly an SO(3)orbit of the natural action on R3, we get the induced action on
C(M)via
(Rf)(x) =f(R 1x): (13)
Let nowR= exp(iP

We then ﬁnd the identical transformation behaviours Rxa=P

bRabXb.
Also here, we note that the Poisson bracket has been chosen such that it is invariant under rotations.
As for the Moyal-Weyl quantum plane, we consider the common eigenmodes of the rotation operators
in the respective representations: For C(M), these are the well known spherical harmonics

for some real normalization constants clwith the sameeigenvalues. However, here we have l=
0;1;2;:::;N 1– providing us with a natural ultraviolet cutoﬀ .
Now, we can deﬁne a quantization map in the same manner as for the Moyal-Weyl quantum plane as
the unique linear map that satisﬁes
Q(Yl
m) =(^Yl
mlN 1
0else(17)
One then veriﬁes that the axioms (1-6) hold (while (5) only holds in the limit !0respectively
N!1). Again, the axioms (5) and (6) make Qunique.
An interesting consequence is the natural quantization of the prefactor1
Nin (11), quantizing the
symplectic volume of S2.
Here, we also have
Q(xa) =Xa; (18)
while for general polynomials in xathe result is (only a little bit) more involved [2, 6, 8, 19].
2.1.3 Quantized Coadjoint Orbits
The idea behind the fuzzy sphere can be generalized from SU(2)to an arbitrary compact semisimple
Lie groupGof dimension D(coming with its associated Lie algebra g), also providing us with a less
ad hoc conception of the former. While this section is rather technical, it can in principle be skipped
leaving most of the remaining comprehensible. Let 2gbe a dominant integral element8.
We consider the coadjoint action of Gon the dual of the Lie algebra g, providing us with the
(coadjoint)orbitO:= Ad(G)()thatisnaturallyasmoothmanifold(infactasocalled homogeneous
space) and isomorphic to the quotient manifold G=G, whereGis thestabilizer of. As long as 
does not lie on the border of a fundamental Weyl chamber, the stabilizer is simply isomorphic to the
maximal Torus T:= exp( h)(otherwiseTis strictly contained in G) and we deﬁne
M:=O=G=G: (19)
If we identify9g=RD, we ﬁnd natural Cartesian embedding functions for M.
The restriction of the Gaction toMis by deﬁnition transitive, while the corresponding inﬁnitesimal
action induces a map, mapping Lie algebra elements X2gto vector ﬁelds VX2X(M). Due to the
transitivity, the image of a basis of gspans the whole tangent bundle, allowing us to uniquely deﬁne
the 2-form
!(VX;VY) := ([X;Y ]) (20)
8We shall assume that a maximal Cartan subalgebra hgand a set of positive roots has been chosen.
9SinceGis compact, ghas a natural Ginvariant inner product (the Killing form) providing us with an inner product
ongand we should identify isometrically with respect to the standard inner product on RD.
14onM, using the Lie bracket in g. It turns out that this is a symplectic form that is further invariant
under theGaction, known as the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form, inducing a Ginvariant
Poisson structure on O.
On the other hand, by the theorem of highest weight, we have a unique ﬁnite dimensional irreducible
representationHofG(coming with a Ginvariant inner product) with highest weight , which we
use as our Hilbert space
H:=H: (21)
Since bothMandHare equipped with Gactions and invariant inner products, we ﬁnd induced
actions (and invariant inner products) on C(M)respectively End(H), and we may decompose each
into irreducible representations of G.
It then turns out that beneath some cutoﬀ (comparing the Dynkin indices of the respective irreducible
representations to the Dynkin indices of ) the two algebras are isomorphic and we may construct a
quantization map Qthat is aGintertwiner and an isometry below this cutoﬀ, where we further deﬁne
a parameter from the Dynkin indices of [2, 4, 5, 17, 20].
Coming back to SU(2)– the universal covering group of SO(3)– maximal tori are isomorphic to
U(1)SU(2)and all dominant integral elements are labeled by a single Dynkin index N=
1;2;3;4;:::.
The stabilizer Gis simply given by U(1), implyingM=SU(2)=U(1)=S2.su(3)is three dimen-
sional, so the above embedding exactly reproduces the Cartesian embedding S2,!R3(again up to a
scalar depending on N). Further the induced Poisson structure simply reproduces equation (11) (up
to a scalar depending on N).
Further, we ﬁndH=H=CN.
The irreducible representations in the decomposition of C(M)are spanned by the spherical harmonics
Yl
mof ﬁxedl, while in the decomposition of End(H)they are spanned by the corresponding eigen-
modes ^Yl
mof ﬁxedl. The cutoﬀ is then simply given by N 1and we have =1
N, while also the
deﬁnition of Qmatches perfectly. Thus we conclude that the fuzzy sphere is a quantized coadjoint
orbit ofSU(2).
Finally, we ﬁnd some parallels in the construction of the Moyal-Weyl quantum plane. However the
analogy works only to some extent.
We might start with the 2n+ 1dimensional Heisenberg group H2n+1, being a central extension of the
translation group R2n. It is rather easy to see that all coadjoint orbits are isomorphic to R2n(carrying
a natural invariant inner product), since the coadjoint action of the central charge is trivial10. The
induced Poisson bracket is then simply given by equation (2) (up to a scalar).
On the other hand, by a more modern version of the Stone-von Neumann theorem [21], the Hilbert
spaceL2(Rn)is the only unitary irreducible representation of H2n+1, while the action of the central
charge on End(L2(RN))is again trivial.
Qis then simply chosen to be an intertwiner of the R2nactions and an isometry, while is only a
scale here.
10This is compatible with the trivial fact that R2nis a representation of itself.
152.1.4 Coherent States on the Moyal-Weyl Quantum Plane
As a good preparation for what is yet to come, we look at a second quantization map for the Moyal-
Weyl quantum plane that is based on coherent states – (normalized) states in Hthat are optimally
localized. Also their generalizations, the quasi-coherent states, will be of great importance in the
following.
As thelocationof a statejvi, we deﬁne the expectation value of the Xa(deﬁned in equation (3)) given
byhvjXajvi. The square of the norm of the average deviation is then given byP
a(hvjXaXajvi 
(hvjXajvi)2). (By the Heisenberg uncertainty principle we know that this value is strictlypositive.)
The normalized vector jviis then said to be coherent oroptimally localized (athvjXajvi) if and only
if the latter expression is minimal over all normalized states in H.
One then ﬁnds a coherent state j0i, that is optimally localized at the origin11x= 0, implying that it is
at the same time a (the) state minimizing the simpler expressionP
a1
2hvjXaXajvi(where the factor
1
2is purely conventional), representing the Hamiltonian of an ndimensional harmonic oscillator at the
origin. Now, taking into account the action of the translation group (recall U 1
xXaUx=Xa+xa1H),
this immediately implies that jxi:=Uxj0iis a coherent state located at xand minimizing the
expressionhvj1
2P
a(Xa xa)(Xa xa)jvi– the Hamiltonian of a shifted harmonic oscillator, located
atx.
For a later use, this motivates the deﬁnition of (quasi-)coherent states jxito be normalized lowest
eigenvectors of the operator
Hx=1
2X
a(Xa xa)(Xa xa): (22)
Having these states at hand, we can deﬁne a new quantization map for the Moyal-Weyl quantum
plane, given by
Q(f) :=1
(2)nZ
M
f(x)jxihxj; (23)
going under the name of coherent state quantization , where 
 = 2ndx1^^dx2n.
This quantization map satisﬁes the axioms (1-4) and (6), while it is not an isometry. Axiom (1) is
ﬁttingly called completeness relation as it is equivalent to

M
jxihxj=1H; (24)
while the intertwiner property (axiom 6) is equivalent to
Q(vk) =ckVk; (25)
for some proportionality constants ckthat actually tends to 1for!0, thus the Weyl quantization
and the coherent state quantization tend to each other in this limit.
Further, thequasicoherentstatesprovideuswithamapgoingintheotherdirection–a dequantization
11This actually makes j0iunique up to a phase.
16map: We deﬁne the so called symbol map Sym : End(H)!C(M)via
(Sym(F))(x) :=hxjFjxi: (26)
However, at this point it should not be expected that Symis inverse to Q[1, 10].
This construction generalizes to arbitrary matrix conﬁgurations, as we will see in section 2.2, although
the quasi-coherent states are then no longer strictly optimally localized.
2.2 Quantum Matrix Geometries and Quasi-Coherent States
The starting point for our discussion is a so called matrix conﬁguration , an ordered set of DHermitian
endomorphisms respectively matrices12Xaacting on a Hilbert space Hof dimension dim(H) =N > 1
in an irreducible way13. In the following (except explicitly stated otherwise), Nwill be ﬁnite.
(Amatrix model is then given by an action principle for matrix conﬁgurations for ﬁxed DandN.)
We may view such conﬁgurations as quantum spaces which are equipped with a metric (in the light of
section 2.1, the quantum space itself is then given by End(H)=Mat C(N)). The heuristic explanation
why theXarepresent a metric comes from interpreting the Xaas quantized Cartesian embedding
functions for RD, while one can always pull back the Euclidean metric to manifolds embedded into
RD. Yet, there is an intrinsic and more well deﬁned explanation, based on generalized diﬀerential
operators.
Considering a manifold, a linear diﬀerential operator @on the algebra of smooth functions is character-
izedbylinearity andthesatisfactionofthe Leibniz rule @(fg) =@(f)g+f@(g)forallf;ginthealgebra.
Having a Poisson structure, especially every ifh;gforh2C(M)is a diﬀerential operator. Thus maps
of the form ^@= [H;]forH2End(H)provide a nice generalization to quantum linear diﬀerential
operators14since they are linear and satisfy the generalized Leibniz rule ^@(FG) =^@(F)G+F^@(G)(see
especially footnote 2 on page 10). Having this at hand, we can deﬁne the so called matrix Laplacian
:=X
a;bab[Xa;[Xb;]]; (27)
encoding the quantum version of a metric15.
However, this point of view will not play a big role in the following [1, 2, 4, 22].
One advantage of matrix conﬁgurations and matrix models is that with them one starts directly on
the quantum side (and one does not need begin with a classical theory that is subject to quantization)
what is clearly favorable from a conceptional point of view as we expect nature to be inherently a
quantum theory.
Further, (ﬁnite dimensional) matrix conﬁgurations enjoy the generic advantages of quantum spaces as
we have seen them in section 2.1: There is a natural (high energy) cutoﬀ in the observables with many
consequences. Heuristically16, the high energy modes are needed to build observables that allow one
12We always identify H=CNandEnd(H)=Mat(CN)in ﬁnite dimensions.
13This means that the natural action of the matrices on End(H)(given by [Xa;]) satisﬁes [Xa;F] = 08a=)F/1H
in analogy to irreducible Lie algebra actions.
14In fact, as we already interpreted the trace as an integral, the relation tr([H;F]G) = tr(F[H;G])can be interpreted
as partial integration where we observe no boundary terms.
15The use of instead of is purely conventional. In principle, abcan be replaced with abif one wants to work with
the Minkowski signature.
16This topic can be addressed with more rigor in terms of characters , see for example [15, 22]
17to resolve small distances, hence the cutoﬀ causes coarse-graining which is also reﬂected in uncertainty
relations [1, 12, 22].
Also, one can do (quantum) ﬁeld theory on matrix conﬁgurations, which goes under the name of
noncommutative (quantum) ﬁeld theory . For example, we could consider a so called 4Lagrangian
for the ﬁeld 2End(H)
S[] = tr1
2 +1
2m22+
4!4
; (28)
wheremis themassof the ﬁeld and is thecoupling constant . This can be seen to be the quantization
of the well known ordinary 4theory over a classical space.
Yet there are great consequences of the noncommutativity: One can quantize the classical dynamics
described by the action via path integrals . Especially one ﬁnds the partition function17
Z[J] :=Z
De S[]+tr[J](29)
for an external current J, while the integration runs over all matrices 2End(H). However, the
measureDis here well deﬁned since one simply integrates over a ﬁnite dimensional vector space.
Due to the natural cutoﬀ, we might hope that no ultraviolet divergences occur, however we are
disappointed here: We get a new kind of divergences, where ultraviolet and infrared contributions mix
(so called UV/IR mixing) which is not acceptable in view of what we know from ordinary quantum
ﬁeld theory.
A heuristic explanation of these eﬀects lies once again in the uncertainty relations: For example for
the Moyal-Weyl quantum plane, we have seen that the average deviation of the location is strictly
greater than zero, meaning that if we look at short scale eﬀects in one direction, automatically long
scale eﬀects come into play in other directions to compensate for the total uncertainty. Evidently,
such a theory then turns out to be strongly nonlocal [2, 12, 13].
Although this looks catastrophic at ﬁrst, a possible cure lies just in an important question that is due
to be posed: Which matrix conﬁgurations should we actually consider?
One answer is the so called IKKT model, a supersymmetric dynamical matrix model that describes
ten Hermitian matrices and spinors (what we neglect here for simplicity) via the (simpliﬁed) SU(N)
invariant action
S[(Xa)] = tr0
@X
a;b;a0;b0aa0bb0[Xa;Xb][Xa0;Xb0]1
A (30)
(whereabis the Minkowski metric in 9 + 1dimensions), preferring almost commutative matrix con-
ﬁgurations. Also here, we can quantize the dynamics via a well deﬁned path integral. The appearance
of the number ten is no coincidence as the model is actually strongly related to string theory and may
be a nonperturbative formulation of type IIB string theory.
The reason why this model is so interesting is that there are strong suggestions that noncommutative
quantum ﬁeld theories on solutions of the IKKT model do not show UV/IR mixing (this is due to the
supersymmetry that relates bosons and fermions) and are supposed to be UV ﬁnite [8, 9, 13, 14].
Also, it has to be mentioned that matrix versions of Yang-Mills gauge theories naturally emerge if one
17Depending on the signature, one might have to replace  7!iin front of the action, causing the need for additional
regularization.

Xa=Xa+Aa: (31)
Further, the dynamics of the Xacarries a dynamical behaviour of the implicitly described metric18
leading to so called emergent gravity oremergent geometry , while there is evidence that through
quantum eﬀects, the Einstein-Hilbert action can be recovered in a semiclassical limit [2, 7, 9, 10, 11].
Although all the mentioned prospects are highly interesting, here we focus on the construction of a
semiclassical limit – especially a classical manifold Mwith additional structure, assuming that we
already chose a speciﬁc matrix conﬁguration. This construction is based on quasi coherent states and
has been introduced in [1].
Intheoptimalcase, thislimitshouldbeasymplecticmanifold M,!RDthatisembeddedinEuclidean

Q(xa) =Xa(32)
for the Cartesian embedding functions xa– however, to which content this is exactly achievable in
general shall be discussed in the following.
2.2.1 Quasi-Coherent States on Quantum Matrix Geometries
The ﬁrst step to construction of a semiclassical limit for a given matrix conﬁguration (Xa)is to deﬁne
quasi-coherent states .
Recalling equation (22) for the Moyal-Weyl quantum plane, we deﬁne the so called Hamiltonian
H:RD!End(H) (33)
(xa)7!Hx:=1
2X
a(Xa xa1)2=1
2X
a;bab(Xa xa1) 
Xb xb1
;
where we call RDtarget space in analogy to string theory. The expression on the (rhs)makes the use
of the Euclidean metric explicit.
One easily veriﬁes that for a given x,Hxis positive deﬁnite, using the irreducibility19. This implies
the existence of a minimal eigenvalue (x)with corresponding eigenspace Ex. In the following we
often restrict to points in20~RD=fx2RD: dim(E x) = 1g, where we ﬁnd a corresponding normalized
eigenvectorjxi2ExHthat is unique up to a complex phase. (At this point this may seem
restrictive, but actually this is a core feature that is necessary to reproduce the appropriate topology
as we will see for the example of the fuzzy sphere in section 2.3.2.) This state we call quasi-coherent
state(atx). Loosely speaking, we have deﬁned a map ji:~RD!H, yet in general we can not ﬁnd a
smooth global phase convention [1].
Sometimes, we are interested in the full eigensystem of Hx, for what we introduce the notation
Hxjk;xi=k(x)jk;xi=k;xjk;xi(depending on the purpose), assuming k(x)l(x)fork<l.
18The semiclassical limit of the metric is usually called eﬀective metric and its inverse is found to be Gab=P
cdacbdgcd, where the objects on the (rhs)will be introduced in the equations (41) and (69).
19While positivity is obvious, deﬁniteness follows from this argument: Assume Hxj i= 0. This implies (Xa xa)j i=
0, but then [Xa;j ih j] = 0for alla, thusj ih j/1H. Now, the ranks can only match for j i= 0[1].
20In appendix A.2 it is shown that ~RDis open in RD.
192.2.2 The Bundle Perspective
In a more abstract language, we have deﬁned a principal ﬁber bundle
p:B ~RDH! ~RDRD(34)
with standard ﬁber U(1)over the open ~RDRD. For a detailed discussion, see the appendices A.1
and A.2. In this picture, we should regard x7!jxias asmooth local section of the bundle, existing
locally around any point in ~RD. (If we want to stress the fact that we consider the local section and
not a single quasi-coherent state, we write jisrespectivelyjxisif we evaluated it at some x.)
The potentially from ~RDmissing points (deﬁning the set K:=RDn~RD) may prevent the bundle from
being trivial or equivalently from admitting global smooth sections.
Now, we deﬁne the natural connection 1-form
iA=hxjsdjxis; (35)
whereAis real. This provides us with the gauge covariant derivative operator
D:=d iA; (36)
acting on sections. Again, for a detailed discussion see appendix A.2.
Under a gauge transformation
jxis7!ei(x)jxis(37)
for some local smooth real-valued function , we ﬁnd the transformation behaviour of the connection
iA7!i(A+d); (38)
while the gauge covariant derivative transforms as its name suggests:
Djxis7!ei(x)Djxis: (39)
Further, we ﬁnd the ﬁeld strength21

2dA: (40)
Form here on, it is more practicable to switch to index notation.
Using the gauge covariant derivative, we ﬁnd the gauge invariant Hermitian form

(turning out to be the pullback of a canonical U(1)invariant bundle metric on TB) that decomposes

2.2.3 The Hermitian Form from Algebraic Considerations
The Hamiltonian (33) is of extremely simple form, allowing us to compute habentirely algebraically
without performing any explicit derivation. This will be very useful for the implementation on a
computer in section 3.
Letx2~RD. As a beginning we ﬁnd22@aHx= (Xa xa1). Thus
(Hx (x))@ajxi=@a((Hx (x))jxi) @a(Hx (x))jxi= (Xa xa+@a(x))jxi;(43)
where we used the eigenvalue equation in the second step and inserted the derivative of Hxin the
third step. The (lhs)is (again by the eigenvalue equation) orthogonal to jxi, thus we get
0 =hxjXajxi xa+@a(x): (44)
Since the multiplicity of the eigenvalue (x)equals one, we ﬁnd by the spectral theorem
Hx (x) =NX
k=2(k(x) (x))jk;xihk;xj: (45)
Now, we deﬁne the pseudoinverse ofHx (x)
(Hx (x)) 10:=NX
k=2jk;xihk;xj
k(x) (x); (46)
satisfying
(Hx (x)) 10(Hx (x)) = (Hx (x))(Hx (x)) 10=1 jxihxj: (47)
Applying this operator to (43), we ﬁnd
(@a iAa)jxi= (1 jxihxj)@ajxi (48)
= (Hx (x)) 10(Xa xa+@a(x))jxi;
where we used the deﬁnition of the connection 1-form [1]. Since by deﬁnition (Hx (x)) 10jxi= 0,
this simpliﬁes even more and we arrive at
(@a iAa)jxi= (Hx (x)) 10Xajxi=:Xa
xjxi; (49)
22Here, we do not distinguish between upper and lower indices since we work with the Euclidean metric.
21with the newly introduced operator Xa
x:= (Hx (x)) 10Xathat is completely independent of any
derivatives.
This allows us to calculate habcomplete algebraically as
hab(x) =hxj(Xa
x)yXb
xjxi; (50)
and consequently gaband!ab.
2.2.4 Algebraic Constraints on the Quasi-Coherent States
Again, due to the simple form of the Hamiltonian (33), we can formulate nontrivial relations between
its spectrum at diﬀerent points.
We start by deﬁning the equivalence relation xy:()Ex=Eyfor all points x;y2~RDand label
the corresponding equivalence classes by Nx:= [x] =fy2~RDjEx=Eygthat we call null spaces .
A direct calculations shows
Hx=Hy+1
2 
jxj2 jyj2
1 X
a(xa ya)Xa: (51)
Assume now that xy, then this impliesP
a(x y)aXajxi/jxi(sincejxiis an eigenvector of all
other terms) and applying (Hx (x)) 10from the left, we ﬁndP
a(x y)aXajxi= 0[1].
Similarly, we ﬁnd the relation
H(1 )x+y= (1 )Hx+Hy+2 
2jx yj2182R: (52)
Considering again the case xy, this shows that also all points on the straight line segment (with
respect to the Euclidean metric) between xandylie in the equivalence class Nx: Sincexywe have
Ex=Ey, but then at (1 )x+yfor2[0;1]the subspace Exremains the lowest eigenspace.
Following this line further jxiremains an eigenvector, so either the line hits Kand beyond another
lowest eigenvector takes the place or jxiremains the lowest eigenvector until inﬁnity.
This yields two important results:
1.Nxis convex,
2.Nxis closed in ~RD.
Since this implies that Nxis a submanifold of ~RD, it makes sense to consider TxNxTx~RD.
Further, any va2TxNxis proportional to (x y)afor somey2Nx, thus
X
avaXajxi= 08v2TxNx: (53)
Our considerations from section 2.2.3 then imply that TxNxlies in the kernel of hab(x)and conse-
quently ofgab(x)and!ab(x)[1].
222.2.5 The Manifold Perspective
In section 2.2.2, we have seen that the quasi-coherent states deﬁne a ﬁber bundle over ~RD. An
alternative viewpoint is to consider the set of all quasi-coherent states of the matrix conﬁguration
(identifying states that discern only in a phase) as a subset of complex projective space
M0:=[x2~RDU(1)jxi=U(1)=n
Exjx2~RDo
CPN 1; (54)
under the identiﬁcation H=CN.
Locally, a smooth section jisofBdeﬁnes a smooth map23qs:=U(1)jis:U~RD!M0. Since
all sections only deviate in a U(1)phase, allqsassemble to a global smooth and surjective map
q:~RD!M0.
Since all our deﬁnitions ﬁt nicely together, qdescends to a bijection q:~RD=!M0[1].
We now want to know whether M0has the structure of a smooth manifold. It is tempting to use the
mapqto construct local coordinates, however this only has a chance if qhas constant rank. As we
will see later, this is not the case in general (look for example at section 2.3.3), so instead we have to
look at the subset of ~RDwhere the rank of qis maximal.
We deﬁnek= maxx2~RDrank(Txq). This allows us to deﬁne ^RD:=fx2~RDjrank(Txq) =kg. One
can easily show that ^RDis open24.
Consequently, we deﬁne M:=q(^RD)and use the same letter qfor the restriction to ^RD.
Then we ﬁnd (using the constant rank theorem and the results from section 2.2.4) that Mis a smooth
immersed submanifold of CPN 1of dimension kwhat we will call quantum manifold orabstract
quantum space , being a candidate for the semiclassical limit of the given matrix conﬁguration. For a
detailed discussion see appendix A.4.
Especially, we have
ker(Txq) =TxNx; (55)
and more importantly
Txq@a=Dajxis(56)
and consequently
Tq(x)M=hDajxisiR: (57)
Further, we can pull back the Fubini–Study metric and the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form
along the immersion M,!CPN 1what we (up to a scale) call gM(a Riemannian metric) respectively
!M(a closed 2-form), reproducing exactly the gaband the!abif further pulled back along qto~RD
[1].
From that, we know that the kernel of gab(x)coincides with the kernel of Txq(sincegMis nondegen-
erate), but we only know that the kernel of Txqlies within the kernel of !ab(x), while there might be
even more degeneracy. For a detailed discussion once more see appendix A.4.
23Actually, we should consider the natural smooth projection p:CN!CPN 1and consequently qs:=pjis.
24See for example the discussion of deﬁnition 2.1 in [17].
23Finally, we deﬁne the set ~M:=f(hxjXajxi)jU(1)jxi2M0gRDand call it embedded quantum
space. In the context of the IKKT model which is strongly related to type IIB string theory, this has
the interpretation as a branein target space. In general, this will not be a manifold25yet it is more
accessible thanMfrom an intuitive point of view, being a subset of RD. This embedded quantum
space ~M,!RDexactly represents the candidate for the space for which we wish equation (32) to
hold [1].
2.2.6 Properties of the Quasi Coherent States
Intheprevious, wehaveseenafewconstructionsbasedonquasi-coherentstatesbuthavenotdiscussed
their actual meaning, except for the coherent states of the Moyal-Weyl quantum plane.
First, we consider the expectation values of the Xain the quasi-coherent state at x2~RD
xa(x) :=hxjXajxiresp. xa(U(1)jxi) :=hxjXajxi (58)
(depending on the context), providing us with a point in ~Mfor some given point in ~RDrespectively
M0. This should be thought of as the location associated to the quasi-coherent state jxi.
Especially we might think of the map U(1)jxi7!xa(x)as the Cartesian embedding functions26that
mapMintoRD, subject to quantization as in equation (32).
For later use, we note
@axb(x) =hxjXb(Da+iAa)jxi+ (hxjXb(Da+iAa)jxi)=hxjXbXajxi+ (hxjXbXajxi)=(59)
= 2hxjX(b(Hx (x)) 10Xa)jxi=hxjXbXajxi+hxjXaXbjxi;
where in the second step the contributions proportional to Aacancel and we used equation (49) [1].
Based on this interpretation, it makes sense to consider the following two quality measures , namely
we deﬁne the displacement
d2(x) :=X
a(xa(x) xa)2(60)
and thedispersion
2(x) :=X
a(Xa)2; (61)
for
(Xa)2:=hxj(Xa xa(x))2jxi=hxjXaXajxi xa(x)xa(x): (62)
Then the displacement measures how far the location of jxiis away from xitself, while the dispersion
measures how well the state jxiis localized at xa(x)via the standard deviation. So, the coherency of
a state is the better the smaller both the displacement and the dispersion are (one directly generalizes
the measures to arbitrary states of norm one).
25It may have self intersections or other peculiarities as we will see in section 4.4.
26Although in general this map will not be a topological embedding or even an immersion.
24Now, we ﬁnd
2(x) +d2(x) =X
a 
hxjXaXajxi xa(x)xa(x) + (xa(x) xa)2
= 2hxj1
2 X
a(Xa xa)2!
jxi= 2hxjHxjxi= 2(x); (63)
but this means that if (x)is small also the dispersion and the displacement are small.
Choosing the lowest eigenstate of Hxby deﬁnition means to minimize the sum of the quality measures,
thus choosing the state of most optimally coherence – the quasi-coherent state [1]. Finally, we note
that if dim(Nx)>0we automatically ﬁnd by equation (63) that can not be constant on Nx(since
the displacement changes while the dispersion remains constant) thus in general we should not expect
thatis small for all x2~RD. In fact we will see that for the fuzzy sphere x7!1forjxj!1.
2.2.7 Quantization and Dequantization
Now, we turn to a very important aspect of the construction. Our intention was to ﬁnd a semiclassical
geometry, corresponding to a given matrix conﬁguration for what we deﬁned the quantum manifold
Mas a candidate.
Therefore, we would like to deﬁne a quantization map QfromC(M)toEnd(H). However, so far
it is necessary to assume that !Mis nondegenerate27(thus symplectic, inducing a Poisson structure
onM) andMis compact, allowing us to integrate over the latter with the induced volume form

M:=1
(k=2)!!^k=2
M. We will deal with the fact that this is not the case in general in section 2.4.
We now deﬁne28thewould-be quantization map (paralleling the idea of the coherent state quantization
for the Moyal-Weyl quantum plane in section 2.1.4)
Q:C(M)!End(H)
7!
(2)k=2Z
M
Mjihj; (64)
whereis chosen such that
(2)k=2V!=N, introducing the symplectic volume V!:=R
M
MofM.
On the other hand, we can deﬁne a dequantization map29that we call symbol map via
Symb : End(H)!C(M)
7!hj ji; (65)
noting that for example xais the symbol of Xa[1].
Thenthereareafewthingsthatwemightconjectureorhopetoﬁnd, atleastapproximately(especially
thatQsatisﬁes the axioms of a quantization map in section 2.1).
27This directly implies that k= dim(M)is even.
28This is meant in the sense (jihj)(U(1)jxi) :=jxihxj.
29The map is obviously independent of the chosen U(1)phase and actually smooth as we can locally express it via
smooth local sections jis.
251. We would appreciate to ﬁnd Q?= Symb 1(in the weak sense SymbQ=idC(M)).
2. This would be plausible if jhxjyij2behaved somehow like a delta distribution or at least as a
strongly peaked Gaussian.
3. Considering the introduction of this section, we might conjecture equation (32) to be true in the
sense
Xa?=Q(xa)/Z
M
Mxajihj: (66)
(Wehavealreadyseenthatweshouldthinkofthe xaaswould-beCartesianembeddingfunctions
embeddingMintoRD.)
4. In order to satisfy the ﬁrst axiom, we need the completeness relation
1H?=Q(1M)/Z
M
Mjihj (67)
to hold. Then the condition on ensures that this equation is consistent when taking its trace.
5. Luckily, axiom two as well as linearity are satisﬁed by deﬁnition.
6. The ﬁrst part of axiom three is again plausible if hxjyiwere similar to the delta distribution.
7. The second part of axiom three becomes plausible if additionally fxa;xbg?=1
ihxj[Xa;Xb]jxi=:
ab(U(1)jxi)for the Poisson structure induced by !M, assuming we can establish Q?= Symb 1
as well asXa?=Q(xa).
(In any local coordinates for M, we can calculate the Poisson bracket asP
;(! 1
M)@xa@xb=fxa;xbg?=ab.)
8. Now, if all Xalie in the image of Q, axiom four is satisﬁed by deﬁnition.
The ﬁrst conjecture cannot hold true in the strong sense in general, since already in simple examples,
Qhas anultraviolet cutoﬀ (strongly oscillating functions are mapped to zero) and thus is not injective.
However, in a certain regime in C(M)respectively End(H)the mapsQandSymbcan be shown to
be approximately mutually inverse. So, we would hope that the Xathemselves lie in that regime. On
the other hand, the result30jhxjyij2e jx yj2
gsupports the second conjecture.
It further turns out that if Xaitself lies in the regime,  2P

the commutators [Xa;Xb]are small compared to the Xain some norm31, which can often be achieved
by choosing Nlarge) and that the @aare small32[1].
We will thus focus in sections 3 and 4 on verifying the completeness relation, the quantization of the
embedding functions and the compatibility of the Poisson structure induced by !Mwith the would-be

31Such conﬁgurations are especially favored by the IKKT model.
32This especially means that xaxa.
262.2.8 Comparison of the Diﬀerent Structures
We have already discussed the objects gaband!ab, but there are further structures available. We
deﬁned the target space together with the Euclidean metric aband in the last section we introduced
the real antisymmetric object33
ab(x) :=1
ihxj[Xa;Xb]jxiresp.ab(U(1)jxi) :=1
ihxj[Xa;Xb]jxi; (69)
what we might call (semiclassical) Poisson tensor since (in the light of the previous section we want
to think of it asfxa;xbgrespectively as the dequantization of1
i[Xa;Xa].
However, there is some caveat: In some sense, gaband!abare tied to the quantum manifold, while
abandabare supposed to be viewed on target space.
To understand this, we note that the ﬁrst two are well deﬁned on Msince they are pullbacks of gM
and!M(as discussed in section 2.2.5) while they need not have to be constant on Nx(equation (79)
shows this explicitly for the fuzzy sphere) – what is somehow peculiar and inconsistent viewed on the
target space. On the other hand, abandabare constant onNx, but cannot be pushed forward to
Mconsistently – in general TxNxdoes not even necessarily lie within the kernel of ab. However, the
component functions can be pushed forward to Mwhich is evident from equation (69).
There is another structure on Mthat we might consider – the (1;1)-tensor ﬁeld JMthat is deﬁned via
gM(;JM()) =!M(;)for all vector ﬁelds ;. If nowJ2
M= PM(for some projector PM=P2
M)
is satisﬁed, we call Malmost Kähler34. Namely, one then has a metric, a would-be symplectic
structure and a would-be complex structure that are compatible [1].
2.3 Examples of Quantum Matrix Geometries and Analytic Results
Having discussed quite a few constructions built on quasi-coherent states, it is time for examples that
actually relate directly to the examples of section 2.1, now viewed as matrix conﬁgurations.
We begin with the Moyal-Weyl quantum plane from section 2.3.1, followed by the fuzzy sphere from
section 2.3.2. An important new example is the squashed fuzzy sphere discussed in section 2.3.3, a
perturbed version of the ordinary (round) fuzzy sphere. Then, in section 2.3.4 we look at coadjoint
orbits, and as an example thereof the fuzzy CP2in section 2.3.5 – the SU(3)equivalent of the fuzzy
sphere. In section 2.3.6 we end with random matrix conﬁgurations.
2.3.1 The Moyal-Weyl Quantum Plane as a Matrix Conﬁguration
The Moyal-Weyl quantum plane can be reformulated as a matrix conﬁguration. Since it guided us
to the deﬁnition and use of quasi-coherent states via the Hamiltonian (33) this is not surprising. We
deﬁne the matrix conﬁguration
R2n
:= (X1;:::;X2n) (70)
33Note that the components depend smoothly on xand that the deﬁnition is independent of the choice of a local section.
34Note that this is a nonstandard notion. If !Mis additionally nondegenerate, Mgets truly Kähler.
27via the operators from equation (3), meaning our target space is RDforD= 2n. This is the one and
only time that we actually deal with an inﬁnite dimensional matrix conﬁguration ( N=1), meaning
that not all arguments from the last section remain valid. Still, we can reproduce most results due to
the simple structure of the geometry.
In section 2.1.4, we have already identiﬁed the (quasi-)coherent states jxi=Uxj0i, where we used
the representation of H2n+1onHand thus ﬁnd ~RD=RD. It is further obvious that the Nxare zero
dimensional. After calculating @ajxivia the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ formula one concludes that
Txqhas full rank for all x2RD. Thus we have ^RD=RDandM=H2n+1j0i=U(1)=R2n.
Calculating35ab,Aa,gaband!ab(the latter reproduces the Poisson structure from equation (2) up
to a scale) is a fairly simple task but not very illuminating, so we stop at this point (after noting that
Qsimply reproduces the coherent state quantization map) and continue with the more interesting
fuzzy sphere [1].
2.3.2 The Fuzzy Sphere as a Matrix Conﬁguration
We start with the three Hermitian matrices Ja
Nfora= 1;2;3andN2– the usual orthonormal gen-
erators of the Ndimensional irreducible representation of su(2)– that satisfy [Ja

This means, our target space is the R3and our Hilbert space is Ndimensional, identiﬁed with CN.

28does not change the eigenspaces and the ordering of the eigenvalues, thus jxi=jxifor >0and
especiallyx2Nx.
Now, using the adjoint representation of SU(2)(namelySO(3)) allows us to calculate jxielegantly.
Letx=jxjR 1

2iis simplyU(1)SU(2)(coming from the one

M=SU(2)=U(1)=S2; (77)

so both Poisson structures coincide exactly up to the factor  2that can be absorbed into the deﬁnition

The implied SU(2)invariance of !abtogether with equation (76) shows that Qis an intertwiner of the
SU(2)action, implying that the completeness relation holds and Q(xa)/Xa, yetQis no isometry
[1]. This will be discussed more generally in section 2.3.4.
302.3.3 The Squashed Fuzzy Sphere
We now turn to a more complicated geometry coming with less symmetry than the round fuzzy sphere
from the last section. We rename the corresponding matrices Xa7!Xaand deﬁne the squashed fuzzy
sphereof degreeN

X1;X2;X3

where0is called the squashing parameter .
We directly see that although the matrices still span the same Lie algebra su(2)in the same represen-
tation, the Hamiltonian looses its simple form and symmetry and is given by

Thus we cannot expect to ﬁnd an easy way to calculate (x)andjxiexplicitly using group theory.
Yet, there are a few statements that can be read oﬀ directly.
The quasi-coherent states at points that are related by a rotation around the z-axis are still related
by the corresponding unitary matrix since the SU(2)-symmetry is only partially broken.
We consider the asymptotic Hamiltonian forx6= 0

Considering an x2~R3, by continuity liml!1jlxiis the lowest eigenstate of H1

round fuzzy sphere at the point (x1;x2;x3).
Further, for  < 1andx=jxj^e3, we ﬁndHx=1

2(1 +jxj) (1 2)X3X3, implying that E0is given by the span of jN 1
2i
andj N 1
2i, so02K.
The result thatjN 1
2iis the lowest eigenvector on the whole positive respectively negative part of
thez-axis has profound consequences: It tells us that the rank of qis at most two there. So if the
rank ofqis three at any other point, this means that the whole z-axis has to be excluded from ^R3.
This we will show in a moment for N > 2and= 1 for a small >0.
It is rather obvious that the quasi coherent states can not be calculated explicitly for arbitrary points.
Still, the setup is particularly well suited for perturbation theory if we are only interested in the
vicinity of= 1, thus= 1 . It turns out that a lot of calculation is needed, therefore we refer to
31appendix C for the derivation, featuring an explicit expression for the ﬁrst order correction of hab.
These results explicitly give the terms in the expansion gab=g0;ab+g0
ab+O(2), whereg0;abis the
quantum metric for the round fuzzy sphere given in equation (79).
g0;abhas the eigenvector xa=jxjwith eigenvalue 0, so its determinant vanishes
det (g0;ab) = 0; (89)
just as we would expect.
On the other hand we have
det (g0
ab) =C2

for coeﬃcients Cithat depend only on Nwith their deﬁnition given in equation (199).
The reason why we look at det (g0
ab)is the following: Assume that the latter is nonvanishing for some
x, then this tells us that g0
abhas full rank for these x, hence rank three. But then, making small
enough, also gab(x)will have rank three (just as Txq) and thus the dimension of Mis three (at least
for small). (We note that in turn vanishing det (g0
ab)does not imply that the rank of gabis smaller
than three.)
We assume N > 2(forN= 2we haveC2= 0and thus det (g0
ab) = 0). Now, there are two obvious
zeros, given by either x1=x2= 0(what we would expect from the discussion above) and x3= 0.
Mathematica ﬁnds a third one that is of rather complicated form but only describes a zero set in R3
– just as the ﬁrst two.
Now, this leads us to the conclusion that the rank of Txqis three almost everywhere at least for small
and thus we have k= Dim(M) = 3rather than two.
Numerical results suggest that only along the z-axis the rank of qis reduced.
Any further analysis of the squashed fuzzy sphere shall be postponed to section 4.1 until we are ready
to do numerical calculations.
2.3.4 Quantized Coadjoint Orbits as Matrix Conﬁgurations
We can immediately generalize the description of the fuzzy sphere analogously to the discussion in
section 2.1. Also this section is rather technical and can in principle be skipped, leaving most of the
remaining comprehensible.
LetGbe a compact semisimple Lie group of dimension Dwith its associated Lie algebra g. Assume we
have chosen a maximal Cartan subalgebra hgand a set of positive roots. Let 2hbe a dominant
integral element, providing us with the unique irreducible representation H=Hwith highest weight
2h. This we use as our Hilbert space of dimension N= dim(H). In order not to confuse 2h
with the lowest eigenvalue of Hxwe write0(x)for the latter in this section.
SinceGis compact, both gandHcarry a natural Ginvariant inner product – for gthis is the Killing
form.
Thus we can chose orthonormal bases T1;:::;TDofgandb1;:::;bNofH. TheTathen act as
Hermitian matrices Ta
in the basis bi.
32SinceGis semisimple, in any irreducible representation, the quadratic Casimir operator TaTaacts as
a scalarC2
and we deﬁne the matrix conﬁguration as
G:= (X1;:::;XD) (91)
forXa:=1
CTa
.
But this allows us to write the Hamiltonian (in analogy to the fuzzy sphere) in the very simple form38

We then may consider (xa)asx2gviax:=P
axa(Ta)where (Ta)is the dual of Tawith respect
to the Killing form.
Letx2gandj i2H, then we deﬁne the coadjoint orbit Ox:= Ad(G)(x)throughxrespectively
the orbitOj i:=G(U(1)j i)throughU(1)j i(where we view U(1)j ias a point in CPN 1, thus
we have already factorized out the U(1)phase).

thus forx2~RDwe ﬁnd Ad(g)(x)2~RDandU(1)jAd(g)(x)i=gU(1)jxi. In terms of orbits this
meansy2Ox=) jyi2Ojxi.
Now, everyOxcontains at least one ~x02hand exactly one x0in the closure of the fundamental
Weyl chamber within h.
Then we can write x0=P
ix0;iifor some coeﬃcients x0;i0where theiare the positive simple
roots.
On the other hand, we can consider the weight basis jiofH, where the are the weights of H

If nowx0lies on the border of the fundamental Weyl chamber (this exactly means that at least one
x0;i= 0), there may or may not be other lowest eigenstates and consequently x0is or is not inK,
depending on whether there is a such thatk

Thus, we conclude that we can always write x= Ad(g)(x0)for ag2Ga pointx0in the closure of

Especially,
M=G(U(1)ji) =Oji=O; (98)
where the last isomorphism is due to the fact that the corresponding stabilizers agree G=GU(1)ji
for a highest weight .
Further, we ﬁnd that this implies a constraint on Gxifx =2K: Since the set of quasi coherent-states
on the coadjoint orbit through xisM, this implies that GxG(otherwise there would be more
quasi-coherent states coming from Oxthan there are points in the orbit). If is from the inner of the
fundamental Weyl chamber, this implies that all orbits through its border belong to K(since there
the stabilizer is strictly larger then G, where the latter is given by the maximal torus T:= exp ( h)),
while these are the only ones. Similar statements can be made if itself is part of the border.
By our construction, !Mcoincides up to a factor with the Ginvariant Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau
symplectic form from section 2.1.3.
But this means that Qexactly intertwines the natural group actions on C(M)respectively End(H).
Thus irreducible representations map to irreducible representations. This directly implies that 1Mis
mapped to 1H(since both transform in the trivial representation) and consequently the completeness
relation is satisﬁed. Since both the xaand theXatransform in the adjoint representation, this also
impliesQ(xa)/Xa.
It turns out that this Qsatisﬁes all axioms of a quantization map but is not an isometry – thus
although (M;!M)andHagree (up to a scale of the symplectic form !M) with our construction in
section 2.1.3, the quantization maps discern – just as the Weyl quantization and the coherent state
quantization were diﬀerent for the Moyal-Weyl quantum plane.
We also mention that Mhere even is a Kähler manifold [1, 20, 23, 24].
Finally, we note that this construction explicitly recovers our ﬁndings for the round fuzzy sphere.
342.3.5 The Fuzzy CP2
After considering the general case, we look at a speciﬁc geometry, the generalization of the fuzzy
sphere from SU(2)toSU(3)called the fuzzy CP2. It will be our simplest example with D> 3in our
numerical considerations in section 4.
LetG=SU(3)(thenD= 8) and consider the representation (n;0)of dimension N=(n+1)(n+2)
2.
Then we ﬁnd the matrices Ta
N(generalized Gell-Mann matrices) and the quadratic Casimir C2
n=
1
3(n2+3n)as discussed in appendix B.2 (with an explicit implementation for Mathematica introduced
in [25]).
Then we can apply the general construction and obtain the matrix conﬁguration
CP2
n:= 
X1;:::;XD
; (99)
where theXDare normalized toP
aXaXa=1.
Let us ﬁrst discuss why we only consider the (n;0)representations. SU(2)has the two Cartan
generatorsT3andT8,thusthedimensionofthemaximaltorusis dim(T) = 2,meaningthat dim(M)
6where equality exactly holds if the highest weight lies within the fundamental Weyl chamber. On
the other hand, dim(CP2) = 4, thus we have to consider representations with highest weight in the
border of the fundamental Weyl chamber.
It turns out that (except the trivial representation) the only such representations are given by (n;0)
with the corresponding stabilizer SU(2)U(1)of dimension dim(SU(2)U(1)) = 3 + 1 = 4 . Here,
we have
=SU(3)=(SU(2)U(1))=CP2; (100)
explaining the name of the matrix conﬁguration [1, 20].
Obviously, this means that we ﬁnd M=CP2, yet it is instructive to sort out how Klooks like. We
know thatKis built from coadjoint orbits through the border of the fundamental Weyl chamber.
Identifying R8=su(3), the border is given by the rays R+

(This corresponds to the fact, that all positive simple roots kare orthogonal to 0and for two of

2.3.6 Random Matrix Conﬁgurations
Let us assume that we know nothing about a given matrix conﬁguration (Xa), respectively that it is
constituted from DrandomNNHermitian matrices.
Then there are two constraints on the dimension kofM: By our construction kDandk2N 2.
The ﬁrst constraint is due to the limitation of the quasi-coherent states due to their dependence on
target space RD, while the second constraint is due to the immersion of MintoCPN 1.
Thus, we conclude
k= dim(M)minfD;2N 2g: (107)
Justasrandommatricesusuallyhavemaximumrank(thesetofmatriceswithreducedrankisalwaysa
zero set), we should expect for random matrix conﬁgurations that Massumes its maximum dimension
k= minfD;2N 2g.
If the squashed fuzzy sphere behaved randomly, this would tell us that it had k= 3forN > 2
respectively k= 2forN= 2, agreeing with our results from section 2.3.3.
362.4 Foliations of the Quantum Manifold
In this section, (approximate) foliations ofMare discussed, allowing us to look at (approximate)
leavesinM(for which we write LM). We will describe these through distributions in the tangent
bundle ofMrespectively of ~RD(in the latter actual calculations are easier, while using qwe can push
forward toMeither the distribution itself or the resulting leaves).
Recallingthesquashedfuzzyspherefromsection2.3.3, wehaveseenthattherearepoints xin~R3where
the rank of Txqequals two, while for most others it equals three (implying an awkward discrepancy
between ~RDand^RD). Yet in the round case we globally had rank two. We will later see that in a sense
one of the three directions is strongly suppressed with respect to the quantum metric in comparison
to the others.
On the other hand, since Mis three dimensional, it can not be symplectic with any chance – for
example prohibiting to integrate over M.
Similar phenomena arise for other (deformed) quantum spaces.
If we had a degenerate Poisson structure on M, one way to proceed would be to look at the naturally
deﬁned symplectic leaves. Yet a manifold with a degenerate symplectic form does not necessarily
decay into a foliation of symplectic leaves.
However, we still can try to ﬁnd (approximate) foliations ofM. As (exact) foliations are in one to
one correspondence with smooth involutive distributions via the Frobenius theorem (see for example
[17]), we deﬁne approximate foliations of Mvia general distributions in the tangent bundle TMthat
can then be integrated numerically as we will discuss in section 3.
For these leaves we wish the following heuristic conditions to be fulﬁlled:
1. The dimension of the leaves respectively the rankof the distribution (for what we write lk)
should be even and in cases of deformed quantum spaces it should agree with the dimension
of the unperturbed M. We would also hope that lis smaller or equal than the minimum of
rank(Txq)over ~RD– potentially allowing us to include all points in ~RD.
2. The leaves should contain the directions that are not suppressed with respect to the quantum
metric, while the suppressed directions should labelthe leaves. In the latter directions the quasi-
coherent states should hardly change. This means lshould agree with the eﬀective dimension
ofM, where the exact deﬁnition of the latter dependece on the speciﬁc case.
3. The restriction of !Mto the leaves (for what we write !L) should be nondegenerate and thus
symplectic.
The directions in RDorthogonal to the leaves (after precomposition with Txq) will then be considered
as approximate generalizations of the null spaces Nx(we might writeNL
x~RDfor them) on which
we expect to ﬁnd almost the same quasi-coherent states.
Once having a foliation of M, the question remains which leaf Lto choose – this problem also has to
be addressed.
If we made a speciﬁc choice, we can then formally reﬁne the quantization map Qfrom section 2.2.7
by replacing allM7!L.
The ﬁrst approach that we look at is the most obvious way to construct symplectic leaves of maximum
37dimension which is explained in section 2.4.1 (we thus talk of the symplectic leaf if we mean the
construction). This approach in general turns out not to satisfy the second condition, leading us to
thePfaﬃan leaf described in section 2.4.2 that is based on a quantum version of the Pfaﬃan of ab.
This method turns out to be rather time consuming in calculation, directing us to a simpliﬁed version
what we call hybrid leaf discussed in section 2.4.3. A ﬁnal approach is based on the idea to consider
leaves that are in a sense optimally Kähler39(theKähler leaf ) what is presented in section 2.4.4.
From now on, we use the Einstein sum convention when appropriate.
2.4.1 The Symplectic Leaf
Let us start with the so called symplectic leaf. We assume that !Mis degenerate as it is in the
example of the squashed fuzzy sphere. Especially all cases where the dimension kofMis odd fall in
this category.
Our approach is to deﬁne a distribution of rank l= rank(!M)that is orthogonal to the kernel of !M
with respect to gM, resulting in symplectic leaves of the maximally possible dimension.
The construction works as follows: Let p2M. OnTpMwe naturally deﬁne the degenerate subspace
TpZM:= ker(!M(p)) =f2TpMj!(;) = 0g. Actually, we are interested in some complement
TpLMofTpZ(there,!M(p)is by deﬁnition nondegenerate).
In general there is no natural complement, but Mis also equipped with a nondegenerate metric gM,
allowing us to deﬁne TpLM:=TpZ?
Mvia the induced orthogonal complement.
Then we deﬁne TLMas our distribution. Thus we ﬁnd the evensymplectic dimension l= rank(!M)
(note that we actually do not know if lis constant onM).
In practice, we want to work with g= (!ab(x))and!= (gab(x))in target space for a given x2~RD
withq(x) =p, since calculations are much easier there. But then, special care has to be taken, as qis
not inverse to a coordinate function in the usual sense, since D kcoordinates are always redundant.
In appendix 2.2.5 we have already seen that we can lift the problem locally by choosing kindependent
coordinates and dropping the remaining ones. However, here a diﬀerent approach is more comfortable.
We deﬁneTxW:=TxNx= ker(Txq)Tx~RD. Assuming k < D, we know that both gand!act as
zero onTxW. Thus, there we deﬁne an inner product gWby the inclusion into Tx~RDand extend it
by zero to the induced orthogonal complement. Then gW+gis a nondegenerate inner product on the
wholeTx~RD.
This allows us to formulate the orthogonal complement as TxV:=TxW?with respect to gW+g. This
subspace is what we take as a representative for TpMas we note that Txq(TxV) =TpMand that
gis nondegenerate on TxV. However, of course this representative is not uniquely satisfying these
properties.
Then, we deﬁne TxZ:= ker(gW+!)as representative of TpZMandTxL:=TxZ?(again with
respect togW+g) as representative of TpLM, as we actually ﬁnd Txq(TxW) =f0gTpMas well as
Txq(TxZ) =TpZMandTxq(TxL) =TpLM.
In this setting, the symplectic dimension is given by l=D dim(ker(!)).
One obstacle of this leaf is that lwill be too large in general. For example for the squashed fuzzy CP2
the rank of !Mwill bel= 8, while in the round case we have k= 4(as we will see in section 4.3), so
this method will not help us to reduce the eﬀective dimension.
39This is based on the ﬁnding that for quantized coadjoint orbits Mis a Kähler manifold.
382.4.2 The Pfaﬃan Leaf
We now look at an alternative approach to foliate Mthat is not bound to the degeneracy of !M.
Further, the formulation is more aﬃne to target space as it is not based on the quantum metric and
the would-be symplectic form.
Letx2~RDand0sDbe an even integer and consider the Grassmannian manifold Grs(Tx~RD),
the manifold of linear subspaces of Tx~RDwith dimension s. Then we deﬁne the generalized Pfaﬃan
Ps
x: Grs(Tx~RD)!C (108)
V7!hxj[Xa1;Xa2]:::[Xas 1;Xas]jxia1:::as
V;
where
a1:::as
V :=Oa1b1:::Oasbsb1:::bs(109)
is the Levi-Civita symbol on V, using any orthogonal map O:Rs!VTx~RD(with respect to the
standard inner product on Rsand the standard Riemannian metric on ~RDRD).
Ps
x(V)is called generalized Pfaﬃan since it can be viewed as the dequantization of a quantum version
of the Pfaﬃan40ofjV, the volume density constructed from jVwhere= (ab(x)).
SoPs
x(V)should be thought of as a volume density assigned to V(up to a complex phase). Then max-
imizing this density over Grs(Tx~RD)heuristically means to pick the directions that are not suppressed
in the context of condition 2.
Since Grs(Tx~RD)is compact, the absolute square of the generalized Pfaﬃan attains its maximum. We
deﬁneVs
x;maxto be the (hopefully unique) subspace of dimension swhere the latter attains its maxi-
mum, coming with the absolute square of the corresponding volume density vs
x;max :=jPs
x(Vs
x;max )j2.
This ﬁxes two problems at hand: It allows us choose the eﬀective dimension las the maximal ssuch
thatvl
x;max0(in whatever sense) and then choose Tq(tx2^RDVl
x;max )as distribution, deﬁning the
Pfaﬃan leaf41.
Yet, there is an obstacle with this leaf as we do not know if !ab(x)is nondegenerate on Vl
x;max. In
principle there could even be vectors in Vl
x;maxthat lie in the kernel of Txq.
2.4.3 The Hybrid Leaf
While the symplectic leaf does not suﬃciently reduce the eﬀective dimension, the Pfaﬃan leaf is
numerically diﬃcult to calculate. Thus we introduce a hybrid of the two, based on ab.
Let:= (ab(x))for a given x2~RD, having the eigenvectors viwith corresponding eigenvalues i
(ordered such that jijjjjifi>j).
Sinceis skew symmetric, the eigenvalues come in pairs 2s 1= +isand2s= isfors2R
and consequently j2s 1j=j2sj. We thus choose lsuch, thatjl+1j0, whilejlj0. (Note that
this immediately implies that lis even.)
We also deﬁne w2s 1= Re(v2s 1) = Re(v2s)andw2s=Im(v2s 1) =Im(v2s). Thenw2s 1=
40This is up to a complex phase given by hxj[Xa1;Xa2]jxi:::hxj[Xas 1;Xas]jxia1:::as
V.
41Note thatPl
xis constant along the Nxand that a large vl
x;maxsuggests that vl0
x;maxis also large for l0<l.
39sw2sandw2s=sw2s 1, sohw2s 1;w2siis the subspace corresponding to s. We consequently
deﬁneVx:=hw1;:::wli, leading to the distribution Tq(tx2^RDVx).
Since the Pfaﬃan is related to the product of the eigenvalues, this result is quite parallel to the Pfaﬃan
method if we assume that hxj[Xa1;Xa2]:::[Xal 1;Xal]jxihxj[Xa1;Xa2]jxi:::hxj[Xal 1;Xal]jxi
(what is plausible if the matrices Xaare in the regime brieﬂy discussed in section 2.2.7 [1]).
Also here, we do not know if !ab(x)andTxqare nondegenerate on Vx.
A slightly modiﬁed version (that is more parallel to the symplectic leaf), where we use !abinstead
ofabﬁxes the last problem, since then !ab(x)andTxqdeﬁnitely are nondegenerate on Vx. In the
following, we always explicitly specify if we work with the hybrid leaf based on abrespectively based
on!ab.
2.4.4 The Kähler Leaf
Finally, we discuss an approach based on the fact that for quantized coadjoint orbits the manifold M
is a Kähler manifold, corresponding to the observation that then we can choose the local sections jis
in a holomorphic way (but then we have to accept that the jxisare no longer normalized).
This is further directly related to the following property: iDajxi2hDbjxiiR, noting that we should
think ofhDbjxiiRH=CNas a representative of Tq(x)M, so the representative of the tangent space
is closed under the action of i, assuming that we have chosen an x2~RD[1].
For general matrix conﬁgurations, we will ﬁnd iDajxi=2hDbjxiiR, but we might try to ﬁnd a maximal
subspaceVxhDbjxiiRthat is approximately invariant under the multiplication with i, meaning it
is (approximately) a complex vector space and thus even dimensional.
In the following, we are going to identify CN=R2N, thus it is convenient to consider multiplication
withias the application of the linear operator Jjvi=ijvi.
The best way to ﬁnd such a Vxis to construct a function on Grs(hDbjxiiR)Grs(R2N)for evens
that measures how well the subspace is closed under the action of J.
This means, we need a distance function d: Grs(R2N)Grs(R2N)!R. A common choice for such a
function is given by
d(V;W ) := sup
v2V;jvj=1inffjv wjjw2Wg: (110)
The latter expression can be calculated in the following way: Let PWbe the orthogonal projector on
Wand letiVbe the natural inclusion of VintoR2N, then
d(V;W ) =k(PW 1)iVk2; (111)
wherekk 2is thespectral norm42[26].
42When we actually calculate the Kähler cost, it may be convenient to replace the spectral norm with the Hilbert-
Schmidt normkk27!kkHS– although then dis not necessarily a true distance function any more.
40Having this distance function at hand, we deﬁne the so called Kähler cost
Cs
x: Grs(hDbjxiiR)!R; (112)
V7!d(V;JV ):
Viaq, this can be pulled back to Grs(Tx~RD)and we deﬁne
cs
x: Grs(Tx~RD)!R; (113)
~V7!d(Txq(~V);JTxq(~V)):
We note, that by our construction Cs
x=cs
x= 0for quantized coadjoint orbits.
Now, we deﬁne ~Vs
x;minto be the (hopefully unique) subspace of dimension swherecs
xattains its
minimum and vs
x;min :=cs
x(~Vs
x;min )as the corresponding Kähler cost. Then we choose las the
maximalssuch thatvs
x;min0and deﬁne the distribution as Tq(tx2^RD~Vl
x;min ).
Yet, also here we do not know if !ab(x)andTxqare nondegenerate on ~Vl
x;min.
Even if this method should not be well suited for determining foliations (as it turns out to be the case
in section 3), the Kähler cost remains an interesting quantity.
413 The Implementation
In this section the implementation on a computer of the various concepts that were introduced in
section 2 is discussed.
The corresponding algorithms are rather sketched than shown in full detail. Further, the focus lies on
the use of Mathematica as the latter is used for all explicit calculations.
Many of the algorithms are demonstrated on the squashed fuzzy sphere (from section 2.3.3) for N= 4
and= 0:1respectively = 0:9(whatever is more instructive).
If not stated explicitly, we will not discern between ~RDand^RDin the following since the diﬀerence
will not play an important role.
In section 3.1 the basic quantities like the quasi-coherent states jxiand the quantum metric gabare
calculated. The section 3.2 then discusses multiple approaches to visualize the quantum manifold
M. The ﬁnal section 3.3 treats the various methods for foliations, allowing us to construct curves in
the leaves (what we call integrating curves in the leaves) and consequently adapted coordinates what
enables us to integrate over them globally.
3.1 The Basic Quantities
Assume we have chosen a point x= (xa)2RD. As a beginning, we are interested in ﬁnding the basic
quantitiesjxi,gab(x)and similar43. This can be achieved in the following steps.
•(x)andjxican easily by calculated via the eigensystem of Hx(given by equation (33)).
Often it is useful to introduce a phase convention (for example hNjxi0wherejNi:= ^eN2
CN), although we have to accept that there is no smooth global convention.
•Already a bit more involved is the calculation of (@a iAa)jxi. There are two available methods:
Either one can calculate the diﬀerence quotient of jxifor a choice of some small and calculate
Aausing equation (35) or one proceeds using the eigensystem of Hxfollowing section 2.2.3,
especially using equation (49). The latter has the advantage that the calculation is pointwise
and independent of some arbitrary (thus that will be the standard choice), while in the ﬁrst
some kind of phase ﬁxing is particularly important in order to obtain a smooth dependence of
jxionx(we once again note that this can only be achieved locally).
•Having these quantities, hab,gaband!abcan readily be calculated using equation (41).
•We can also calculate Ja
b, related to JMfrom 2.2.8, but unless gabis nondegenerate, we need
some pseudoinverse44g0abofgab. Then we ﬁnd Ja
c=g0ab!bc.
•Finally,abcan be calculated using equation (69), while we ﬁnd xaby equation (58) and @axb
using equation (59).
Being able to calculate these important quantities, we are further interested in the calculation of
simple invariants like k= dim(M)or the rank of !ab. Also, we may want to check if for example the
kernels ofabandgabagree.
43We will mostly drop the argument from gab(x)and similar.
44The pseudoinverse satisﬁes g0acgcb=pa
b=gbcg0cafor a projector pa
bof the same rank as gab. Such a method is
already part of Mathematica.
42•Actually, before we do anything else, we should check whether xlies within ~RDorK. This can be
done by checking the degeneracy of the lowest eigenvalue of Hxvia the respective eigensystem.
•The dimension45kofMcan be calculated via the rank of Txq. According to equation (56), we
can calculate the rank of Txqvia the real rank of ((@a iAa)jxi), considered as a matrix. The
real rank of a complex matrix Ais simply deﬁned as
rank R(A) := rank 
Re(A)
Im(A)!
: (114)
•The ranks of gab,!abandabcan be calculated directly, where we already know that rank(gab)!=
k, while the rank of !abis even and bounded from above by k. For the rank of abwe have no
such constraints in general.
•Also, we are interested in the kernels46ofTxq(which we can calculate using the above iden-
tiﬁcation), gab,!abandab. Mathematica outputs for these a basis of the respective vector
spaces.
•This allows for a sequence of checks: We know that the kernel of Txqshould be contained in the
kernel of!aband agree with the kernel of gab. We might want to verify if that actually holds
true.
Since we are only in possession of bases of the respective kernels, we use the following relation47:
hv1;:::;vmihw1;:::;wni() rank(w1;:::;wn) = rank(w1;:::;wn;v1;:::;vm);(115)
where the rank is calculated for the matrices constituted from the respective column vectors.
•Finally, we can check the almost Kähler condition deﬁned in 2.2.8: It is satisﬁed if and only if
(Ja
b)2has eigenvalues 1or0.
While the actual discussion of the squashed fuzzy sphere shall be postponed to section 4.1, we can
demonstrate the output of what we achieved so far. (Here, we use = 0:9, thus= 0:1.)
For the random point x= ( 0:414; 0:584;0:161), we ﬁnd
(gab) =0

45Strictly speaking, we have to assume that x2^RD, else we only calculate the local rank of Txq. Thus in order to
calculate the true kit is advisable to calculate the respective rank for multiple points and take the maximum. Then
only the points where the maximum is attained lie within ^RD.
46Althoughabtakes 1-forms as arguments, we can implicitly convert the kernel to vectors using the isomorphism
induced by ab.
47To see this, we note that the span of the viis contained in the span of the wiif and only if adding any vito the span
of thewidoes not increase the vector space. When a vector space is extended, its dimension always increases while
the dimension equals the rank of the matrix built from basis vectors, thus the rank increases.
43where the (rhs)comes from the perturbation theory in appendix C.
HereTxqandgab(x)have the maximal rank three, while !ab(x)andab(x)have rank two. Conse-
quently, the kernel of the ﬁrst two is f0g, thus they are automatically contained in all other kernels.
For!ab(x)andab(x)we ﬁnd that the respective kernels do notagree. Further (Ja
b)2has the eigen-
values 1:000; 1:000;0:000, thusMis almost Kähler.
Considering the special point x= (0;0;1), we ﬁnd that all Txq,gab(x),!ab(x)andab(x)have rank
two and that all kernels agree.
Thus we have k= 3and( 0:414; 0:584;0:161)2^R3, while (0;0;1)2~R3but not in ^R3.
3.2 The Visualization
In order to obtain an intuitive understanding of M, it would be advantageous to depict Mor subsets
thereof, described via points or subsets of ~RD. (Often, for the sake of convenience, we will speak of
points in ~RDbut mean either their image under qor(xa), yet this should always become clear from
the context.)
Unfortunately, there is no general elegant way to plot subsets of (respectively points in) CPN 1and
consequently ofM. Yet, we can deﬁne a smooth map v:CPN 1nZ! CN 1=R2(N 2)by
[(a1;:::;aN)]7!jaNj
j(a1;:::;aN)j(a1=aN;:::;aN 1=aN); (118)
where48Z=f[b1;:::;bN]2CPN 1jbN= 0g. This is equivalent to choosing the unique normalized
representative in the quotient with aN0.
Although any such construction can not work globally, this map still is not too bad since the points
inZthat we had to exclude are conﬁned to a set of measure zero with respect to the Fubini-Study
metric. Plots generated with this method will be referred to as plots ofM.
Alternatively, we can deﬁne the map w:CPN=S2N 1=U(1)!RDviaU(1)jvi7!(hvjXajvi)(thus
by equation (58) wjM= (xa)) in order to obtain points in RD. In this sense depicting Mvia this
constructions is equivalent to depicting ~Mand we will be referring to plots based on this approach
asplots of ~M.
Also, we note that in the case of the round fuzzy sphere for N= 2this is exactly the Hopf map up to
a rescaling.
Further, if we are concerned with foliations as described in section 2.4, we directly obtain varieties in
~RDthat we might want to depict. Consequently we will talk of plots of ~RD.
For all of the three cases, we still have to plot subsets of Rlfor somelthat in general is bigger than
three.
The ﬁrst approach to this is to choose a rank three projector PonRland anSO(l)operatorOthat
maps the image of PtoR3f0g, resulting in a map P=OP:Rl!R3.
If we want to apply Pafterv, our generic choice is to map
[(a1;:::;aN)]v7!jaNj
j(a1;:::;aN)j(a1=aN;:::;aN 1=aN) (119)
P7!jaNj
j(a1;:::;aN)j(Re(a1=aN);Re(a2=aN);Im(a1=aN));
48The prefactor could also be omitted, but since we always work with normalized vectors, this choice lies at hand.
44if we want to apply it to points of RD, it is
(x1;:::;xD)P7!(x1;x2;x3): (120)
Plots based on this approach will be referred to as projective plots .
Alternatively, we might only consider points that lie within a three dimensional hyperplane of Rl.
Let againP=OPandv2Rl, then every three dimensional hyperplane can be written as fx2
Rlj(1 P)(x v) = 0gfor some rank three projector Pand somev. Thus, our method looks as such:
Check ifxlies within the hyperplane (if yes keep the point, else drop it) and then apply P.
In practice, we will not demand the constraint exactly, but rather j(1 P)(x v)j<for some small
cutoﬀfor obvious reasons.
If we use this approach, we will refer to sliced plots .
In ﬁgure 1 we demonstrate projective plots of Mand ~Mand a sliced plot of Mfor= 0:1. (Here,
withthe tolerance is meant and not 1 .) In all cases we show random points in ~R3(strictly
speaking points in R3), lying in the unit ball.
Here, we directly see a disadvantage of the sliced plots: Most points lie outside the slice, resulting in
many computations that do not contribute to the picture.

Mfor10000points, middle: projective plot of ~Mfor10000points, right: sliced plot of Mfor50000
points
In order to get a more detailed understanding of how the mappings qandxawork and howMand ~M
look, it can be rewarding to consider coordinate lines in ~RDin favor of random points. In the simple
case ofD= 3we might for example use Cartesian or spherical coordinate lines as shown in ﬁgure 2.
Figure 2: Coordinate lines in R3. Left: Cartesian coordinate lines around x= (0;1;0), middle:
spherical coordinate lines, right: smaller sector of spherical coordinate lines at equator. The latter
two have inverted colors in the southern hemisphere
From these, we get plots of Mand ~Mas shown in 3. Fitting to our previous knowledge, it is plain
to see that the dimension of Mis (at least) three.
45Figure 3: The squashed fuzzy sphere for N= 4and= 0:1. Left to right: coordinate lines from
ﬁgure 2; top: plot of M, bottom: plot of ~M
The discussion so far gave us the possibility to generate plots for points in ~RD. Yet, for given x
we might also consider the states that we get for liml!1jlxi, the so called asymptotic states. We
can obtain them by considering the asymptotic Hamiltonian (87) where we drop the O(jxj 1)terms,
allowing us to explicitly compute49the latter as lowest eigenstate of  P
axa
jxjXa(assuming that the
lowest eigenspace is one dimensional). If we look at plots that show asymptotic states, we speak of
asymptotic plots .
In some sense, these states form part of the closure of M.
In ﬁgure 4 we can see such plots together with random points within a ball of unit radius as in ﬁgure
1 and points on a sphere of radius 0:001, where the latter represents the opposite limit for liml!0jlxi.
For example on the left, we see that the asymptotic states (the blue points) form a boundary of the
random points within (the orange points). Note that the gap in between is a result of our restriction
to the unit ball for the random points.

of radius 0:001(green) in the squashed fuzzy sphere for N= 4and= 0:1. Left: projective plot of
M, right: projective plot of ~M
49Especially we can restrict to points of norm jxj= 1.
463.3 Foliations, Local Coordinates, Integration and Completeness
The next step is to implement the various distributions from section 2.4. In section 3.3.1 we begin
with calculating the projectors on the distribution, in turn allowing us to integrate curves in the leaves
Lin section 3.3.2.
With such curves we scanLglobally in section 3.3.3 and construct local coordinates in section 3.3.4.
Viatilings, introduced in section 3.3.5, we are ready to integrate over the leaves in section 3.3.6,
allowing us to check for example the completeness relation (67).
Finally, in section 3.3.7 an approach for choosing a special leaf is presented, based on the attempt to
minimizeoverNL
x.
3.3.1 Calculation of the Distributions
In section 2.4 we have deﬁned the respective leaves via distributions in the tangent bundle in the
spirit of the Frobenius theorem. Especially, we were working with ~RD, where the tangent spaces are
isomorphic to RDand thus rather simple. Any such distribution induces a distinguished subspace Vx
inTx~RD=RDand consequently we get an orthogonal projector pxon this subspace with respect to
any inner product.
In principle, the leaf is independent of the choice of an inner product, while the speciﬁc curves that
we will integrate in the next section are dependent. Thus we use abas our generic choice, while it is
conceptually more obvious to use gabfor the symplectic leaf and the hybrid leaf using !ab. (In fact,
in the latter case both versions will be implemented and it will always be speciﬁed which metric is
used.)
Knowing these projectors for all x2~RDcharacterizes the distribution, thus our current task is to
calculate the orthogonal projector pxonVxfor givenx.
Let us begin with the symplectic leaf , for which the construction has been discussed in section 2.4.1:
We split the tangent space at xinTx~RD=TxWTxZTxLand useTxLas our desired local
subspaceVx.
•The starting point is to calculate gaband!abas discussed in section 3.1.
•We ﬁnd a basis of TxWby calculating the kernel of (gab).
•Then, we orthonormalize this basis with respect to ab, providing us with the normalized vectors
w1;:::;wrwherer= dim(ker(g ab)) =D k.
•This deﬁnes a nondegenerate bilinear form on the whole Tx~RDvia~gab:=Pr
m=1(wm)a(wm)b+
gab. (In section 2.4.1 this has been called gW.)
•We would get the complement TxV=TxW?with respect to ~gabexactly via the kernel of
(Pr
m=1(wm)a(wm)b), but we actually do not need that.
•A basis ofTxZ(by deﬁnition lying within TxV) can then be obtained by calculation of the kernel
of~!ab:=Pr
m=1(wm)a(wm)b+!ab. After another orthonormalization with respect to ~gab, we
ﬁnd the basis zr+1;:::;zr+sofTxZ, wheres= dim(ker(~!ab)).
•Then, a basis of TxL= (TxWTxZ)?with respect to ~gabcan be found via the kernel of
((w1)a;:::; (wr)a;(zr+1)a;:::; (zr+s)a)(~gab), which after one further orthonormalization with
47respect to ~gabprovides us with a basis lr+s+1;:::;lD. This then also provides us with the
symplectic dimension l=D r s=k s.
•Finally, we get our desired projector px= (Ps
m=1(lr+s+m)a(lr+s+m)c)(gcb).
In the case of the Pfaﬃan leaf , the procedure is rather diﬀerent. Here, we want to maximize the
functionPs
xover the linear subspaces of Tx~RDwith ﬁxed (even) dimension sas discussed in section
2.4.2, resulting in the optimal subspace Vx. The eﬀective dimension lis then determined in retrospect.
•We start with a random subspace WTx~RD=RDof dimension s, represented by an orthonor-
mal basisw1;:::;ws.
•The ﬁrst task is to calculate Ps
x(W) =hxj[Xa1;Xa2]:::[Xas 1;Xas]jxia1:::as
W(witha1:::as
W :=
Oa1b1:::Oasbsb1:::bsfor any orthogonal Omapping Rsf0gtoW).
SuchanOab(weonlyneedthecomponentswith bs)issimplygivenbythematrix (w1;:::;ws).
The rest of the calculation is trivial but comes with large computational cost, so a clever imple-
mentation is advisable. A way in that direction is to deﬁne the matrices ~Xb:=P
aOabXafor
bs, resulting inPs
x(W) = 2s=2hxj~Xb1:::~Xbsjxib1:::bs.
This can then simply be rewritten as
Ps
x(W) = 2s=2X
sgn()hxj~X1:::~Xsjxi; (121)
where the sum runs over all permutations of(1;:::;s ). In this formulation, we have much
fewer summands than in the original formulation.
•For the optimization process, it is also necessary to calculate the gradient and thehessianofPs
x
with respect to Oab(as the optimization will actually be done with respect to Oab, representing
W).
Analytically, the gradient is given by
d
dOcdPs
x(W) = 2s=2sX
t=1DX
a=1X
sgn()hxj~X1:::XaMat
cd:::~Xsjxi (122)
withMab
cd:=a

d.
Similarly, we ﬁnd the hessian
d
dOefd
dOcdPs
x(W) = 2s=2sX
t6=u=1DX
a;a0=1X
hxj~X1:::XaMat
cd::::::Xa0Ma0u
cd~Xsjxi:(123)
•For further eﬃciency, we note the relations Ps
x(W) =1
sOcdd
dOcdPs
x(W)andd
dOcdPs
x(W) =
1
s 1Oefd
dOefd
dOcdPs
x(W).
•Since we are actually interested in the absolute square of Ps
x, marginal modiﬁcations have to be
made, but that shall not bother us any further.
•For the actual maximization, we use the algorithm described in [27], providing a gradient de-
scent method and a Newton procedure for real valued functions on Stiefel manifolds adapted to
Grassmannian manifolds, where the optimization is with respect to the Oabfrom above. The
output is then given by a matrix Oab, corresponding to the optimal subspace Vx=O(Rsf0g).
The orthogonal projector on Vxis simply given by (px)a
c=Ps
b=1OabOcb.
48•However, we still have to determine the correct sthat we use as eﬀective dimension l. Therefore
we calculate vs
x=jPs
x(Vx)sj2for all even sand deﬁnelas the largest ssuch thatvs
x0(actually
deﬁned asvs
x>for a lower bound of our choice).
Practically, it suﬃces to check lfor a few points and then always use s=l.
For thehybrid leaf , it suﬃces to know ab(x)(respectively !ab(x)andgab(x)), while the remaining
calculations are then straight forward.
•All we need is the eigensystem of := (ab(x)), given in the ordering jijjjjifi>jtogether
with the corresponding eigenvectors vi.
•As described in section 2.4.3, we choose lsuch thatjlj0whilejl+1j0.
•Then, we deﬁne w2s 1= Re(v2s 1) = Re(v2s)andw2s=Im(v2s 1) =Im(v2s)fors=
1;:::;l= 2, providing us with the basis w1;:::;wlofVx.
•Finally, we calculate a corresponding orthonormal basis ~w1;:::; ~wl, allowing us to deﬁne (px)a
b=Pl
s=1( ~ws)a( ~ws)b.
•When we use gabas our metric instead of abtwo simple adaptions have to be made: At ﬁrst, we
have to orthonormalize w1;:::;wlwith respect to gab, resulting in the basis ~w1;:::; ~wl. Then
we get the modiﬁed projector (px)a
b=P
cPl
s=1( ~ws)a( ~ws)cgcb.
•For!ab(x), the procedure is exactly the same. Having in mind the discussion in section 2.2.8,
it is natural to use abwhen using abandgabwhen using !ab, but using abanyways is also
reasonable. To keep the overview we introduce the following nomenclature: If we talk of the
hybrid leaf we useabandab. For the hybrid leaf using !, we use!abandaband only if we
talk of the hybrid leaf using !andgwe actually work with !abandgab.
Finally, we consider the Kähler leaf . Here, the calculation is similar to the Pfaﬃan leaf, but our cost
function looks diﬀerent.
•Again, we start with a random subspace WTx~RD=RDof dimension s, represented by an
orthonormal basis w1;:::;ws.
•Here, we have to calculate the cost cs
x(W) =d(Txq(W);J(Txq(W))) =:d(V;V0), where
d(V1;V2) =k(PV2 1)iV1k2andJrepresents the multiplication with iinCN.
We start by calculating Txq(wt) =PD
a=1(wt)aDajxi, which we then view as a real vector in
R2N. In general, this gives us an overcomplete basis of Txq(W)that isnotorthonormal, thus we
orthonormalize it and obtain the basis ^w1;:::; ^ws0, wheres0is the dimension of Txq(W). The
matrixJdepends on our choice on how we identify CN=R2N, but in any case Jis a simple
orthogonal matrix, thus ~w1;:::; ~ws0for~wi:=J^wiis an orthonormal basis of J(Txq(W)).
In order to write down the operator (PV0 1)iVexplicitly, we need to extend50the basis ~wi
to an orthonormal basis ~w1;:::; ~w2NofR2N. Then, in this basis we ﬁnd ((PV0 1)iV)ab=Ps0
c=1( ~wa^wc)( ^wc~wb) ab, wherea= 1;:::;Dandb= 1;:::;s0. The spectral norm can then
be calculated using built in methods.
50This can be done as follows: We get an orthonormal basis of the complement by calculating the kernel of
(Ps0
t=1( ~wt)a( ~wt)b)and subsequently orthonormalizing the obtained basis.
49If we replace the norm kk 27!kkHS, we ﬁnd the explicit result
k(PV2 1)iV1kHS=vuuts0 s0X
a;b=1( ~wa^wb)2: (124)
•While it is possible to calculate the gradient of cs
xexplicitly, it is computationally faster to
calculate it via ﬁnite diﬀerences. This is due to the fact that the gradient of the Gram-Schmidt
procedure is rather complicated.
•The remaining part of the procedure is completely parallel to the Pfaﬃan leaf, only we maximize
 cs
xinstead ofjPs
xj2, thus we do not repeat the discussion.
For any of the methods above, having a basis of VxTx~RD, it is an easy task to calculate a basis
of the corresponding subspace Txq(Vx) =Tq(x)LTq(x)MviaTxq, while in practice this will not be
needed since most computations will take place in ~RD.
All of the following discussion is completely agnostic to the choice of a special leaf. What is important
is that we can calculate the respective px.
3.3.2 Integrating Curves in the Leaves
As we are able to calculate the orthogonal projectors pxonto the distributions (in target space) for
givenx2~RD, our next task is to integrate (discretized) curves within the respective leaf through q(x).
In the following steps we explicitly construct a discrete curve in ~RDfor a given initial tangent vector
v2Tx~RD=RD. Usingq, this can then be lifted to a discrete curve in the leaf LMthroughq(x)
with initial tangent vector Txq(px(v)). (Thus slightly abusively we also say that the curve in ~RDlies
within the leaf throughx.)
•At ﬁrst, we have to ﬁx a small but ﬁnite step length and deﬁnex0=xas well asv0=v.
•If we already have xiandvi, we deﬁne
xi+1=xi+pxi(vi)
jpxi(vi)j; (125)
where the norm is usually taken with respect to the metric ab, while we would also be free to
usegabin principle.
•In order to proceed further it is also necessary to deﬁne vi+1. For that we have the two choices
vi+1=vorvi+1=pxi(vi): (126)
In the ﬁrst case we hold the unprojected tangent vector ﬁxed (we then speak of a ﬁxed tangent
vector), while in the second we constantly project the previous tangent vector back into the
distribution (thus we speak of an adapted tangent vector ).
•We continue this procedure until we have calculated the desired amount of points.
Let us brieﬂy discuss what we have gained. We constructed a set of points fxig~RDfori= 1;:::;n,
which we take as an approximation to a curve : [0;n]!~RDwith(i) =xi. By our construction,
50we have _(i)pxi(vi)=jpxi(vi)j, thus all tangent vectors of approximately lie within the chosen
distribution – but this exactly means that the curve approximately lies within the corresponding leaf.
Further, the norm of the tangent vector is approximately conﬁned to , so the curve is parameterized
by path length (up to ) with respect to the chosen metric and has approximately length n. If we
want to calculate the length with respect to another metric g0
ab(for example if we used abin the
construction but want to know the length with respect to gab), this can be done via
jjg0n 1X
i=1q
g0
ab(xi)(xi+1 xi)a(xi+1 xi)b: (127)
Finally, we note that if we choose to adapt the tangent vector, this means that approximately is a
geodesic within the leaf with respect to the restriction of the chosen metric51.
In ﬁgure 5 we see curves in all the leaves with same initial xand two diﬀerent initial adapted tangent
vectorsv1andv2. Looking at the single leaves, the really interesting observation is that in every leaf
the two curves intersect each other away from the initial point (both in ~RDandM), meaning the
distributions are (approximately) integrable. However, we have never demanded that they are already
integrable in ~RD, but only inM. Later, it turns out that this is only an artifact of the fact that
we considered the squashed fuzzy sphere, while the integrability in Malso remains intact for more
general matrix conﬁgurations.
Comparing the diﬀerent leaves, we directly note that not all are equivalent as not all colored curves
intersect away from the initial point.
We see that only the curves in the Pfaﬃan leaf and the hybrid leaf (using ) strictly agree (That they
agree is obvious for D= 3. Alsol= 2is immediate.), while at least the curves in the symplectic leaf
and the hybrid leaf using !are not too diﬀerent (both in ~RDandM).
That the curves in the hybrid leaf using !respectively the hybrid leaf using !andgintersect each
other away from the initial point ﬁts to the fact that both leaves are in principle identical, while the
curves themselves do not agree due to the diﬀerent projections px.
However, the Kähler leaf is strongly diﬀerent. Graphically, we see that there we almost have
px(v1)=jpx(v1)j px(v2)=jpx(v2)j.
Here, also the computational time is interesting: While the hybrid methods as well as the symplectic
method are rather fast, the Pfaﬃan method is a bit slower. The Kähler method is already much
slower.
51This is only true if the metric used here and the metric used to deﬁne pxcoincide.

plots of ~RDfor the six diﬀerent leaves, bottom-left: projective plot of ~RDof all leaves, bottom-right:

3.3.3 Scanning the Leaves
The next step is to analyze the leaves globally (or at least on a large scale). This can be done by a
simple procedure that we call scanning the leaf throughx2~RD.
•For eachi= 0;:::;n0we deﬁne the points xij(j= 1;:::;n) as the points we get from integrating
the curve through xi0with adapted initial tangent vector vi0.
•It remains to deﬁne xi0andvi0. This we do iteratively.
•Fori= 0, we putxi0=xand choose vi0randomly.
•Fori>0, we randomly pick a point from the xi0jfori0<ithat we use as xi0and again choose
a completely random vi0.
•In order to obtain reproducible results it is advisable to seedthe random number generator in
advance.
This procedure never leaves the leaf through xsince all the curves that we integrate remain within
individually. Choosing the vi0randomly allows us to lookinto many diﬀerent directions.
52Figure 6 shows a scan of the hybrid leaf. We can see that this allows us to understand the global
structure of the leaf and strengthens our trust in the integrability (of the hybrid leaf). In the plot of
~Mwe see how strongly the squashing pushespoints towards the equator, yet still points in the polar
regions remain part of ~M.

= 0:1. Left: projective plot of ~RD, middle: projective plot of M, right: projective plot of ~M
3.3.4 Construction of Local Coordinates
Having found a tool to analyze the global structure of the leaves, we now need to consider the local
structure. Therefore we want to ﬁnd well adapted local coordinates . In principle, there are two kinds
of coordinates that we can construct.
Let us start with the coordinates of the ﬁrst kind aroundx2~RD.
•Our aim is to iteratively construct points xi1:::ilwithx0:::0=xandij= n;:::;n.
•We pick an orthonormal basis v1;:::;vlofVxTx~RD. Usually, we do this with respect to ab,
but in principle we could also use gab.
•Then, we deﬁne the points xi1:::is 1is0:::0as the points we get from integrating the curve through
xi1:::is 100:::0with ﬁxed tangent vector vsifis>0(respectively vsifis<0) and step length
. This uniquely ﬁxes all xi1:::il.
•We also want to calculate the Jacobian Ji1:::ilfor eachy:=xi1:::il.
Therefore, we deﬁne y
sas the point we reach by integrating one step with step length with
initial tangent vector vs. Then, we set (Ji1:::il)a
s:=1
2(y+
s y 
s)afor some small  >0that
allows us to build a diﬀerence quotient.
•Let us ﬁnally consider the integration of any of the involved curves, producing the point yifor
i= 0;:::; ~nwith step length ~. In order to improve our results it may be advantageous to reduce
the step length ~7!1
m~and consequently calculate m~npointsy0
jforj= 0;:::;m ~nand ﬁnally
putyi=y0
mifor somem2N. (Of course, this also applies to the calculation of the Jacobians.)
If we proceed after this scheme, we say that we usem 1intermediate steps in the curve
integration, reducing the numerical errors we make by taking smaller step lengths.
Having this construction, we may think of the xi1:::ilas a discretization of inverse coordinate functions
  1: ( n ;n+)l!~RD(in order to obtain true coordinate functions around q(x)2LM , we
further had to apply q, but we will keep that implicit) such that   1(i1;:::;il) =xi1:::il, where by
53construction all points xi1:::illie within the leaf through x. In this picture we have @s(  1)aj(i1;:::;il)
(Ji1:::il)a
s.
For thecoordinates of the second kind aroundx2~RD, we have to recall that the curves generated
by adapting the tangent vector are geodesics in the leaf (with respect to the restriction of the chosen
metricaborgabto the leaf). Thus, we can simply construct an exponential map analogous to the
exponential map from Riemannian geometry.
•Again, for a given initial point xwe choose an orthonormal basis v1;:::;vlofVx.
•Let2Rl. Then we deﬁne v:=Pl
s=1svs2Vx. We pick an n2Nsuch that1
njvjis of order
(with respect to the chosen metric).
•Then we deﬁne expx()as the end point we get by integrating a curve with initial point x,

•We can calculate the Jacobian simply as the diﬀerential quotient @s(expx)aj1

•In practice, we will evaluate expxon a latticef n;:::;ngl, providing us with the points
xi1:::il:= expx(i1;:::;il)and the Jacobians (Ji1:::il)a
s:=@s(expx)aj(i1;:::;il).
Here, we should really think of expx:Vx!~RDas the map that maps radial lines in the distribution
atxto geodesics in the leaf through x, locally deﬁning so called normal coordinates .
In ﬁgure 7 we can see local coordinates of the ﬁrst and second kind for the hybrid leaf.
The beneﬁt of the coordinates of ﬁrst kind is that they are fast to calculate, while for y=xi1;:::;il
far away from xit might happen that some of the vslie within the kernel of py, meaning that the
coordinates can not be continued further, while also the ordering of the vstakes a large role.
On the other hand the beneﬁt of the coordinates of the second kind is that they are constructed via
geodesic and completely independent of the ordering of the vs. Further, they can easily be calculated
for arbitrary . Yet, the calculation is more cumbersome since it is not built on a recursion.
In the following, we will always use coordinates of the ﬁrst kind.

N= 4and= 0:1. Top: projective plot of ~RD, bottom: projective plot of M; left: coordinates of
the ﬁrst kind, right: coordinates of the second kind
543.3.5 Tilings
In the following we want to integrate over the leaf Lthrough some x2~RD. Analytically, we would
choose a covering with local coordinates and a subordinate partition of unity to calculate any integral.
Here, we use this idea to patch local coordinate charts together to a global picture. The key to that
is totile~RD. By a tile, we mean a set of the form T= [a1;b1] [aD;bD]RD.
•We begin by scanning the leaf through x.
•Then we choose tiles TinRDthat only overlap at their borders and satisfy the following
conditions: They should be so small that the intersection of the leaf with a tile is diﬀeomorphic
to[0;1]l(thus topologically trivial) but so large that the coarseness of the scan is small in
comparison. Also, aside from where the leaf intersects the borders of a tile, it should not come
too close to them. Finally, the uniﬁcation of all tiles has to cover the scan .
•Then, for each tile Tthat contains at least one point of the scan (a nonempty tile ) we choose
a pointx2Tof the scan that is located as centered as possible. To achieve this, we might
calculate the center of the tile, measure its distance (with respect to the kkmaxnorm) to all
points from the scan that lie within and then choose a point of minimal distance.
•For each nonempty tile T, we generate local coordinates (of the ﬁrst kind) around x, while
choosingnso large that x
i1:::;il=2Tif for at least one swe haveis=n(then we ﬁlledthe
tile).
•Finally, for each nonempty tile we drop the coordinate points that lie outside the tile.
In ﬁgure 8 we can see a covering with local coordinates patched together to give a global picture of the
hybrid leaf, where we have chosen the tiles to be the octants in R3. We can see that we ﬁlled all tiles,
no tiles are empty and obviously we covered the whole scan. While the individual coordinates do not
ﬁt together (this we can see readily from their random directedness), this construction will turn out
to be very practical in the next section.

553.3.6 Integration over the Leaves
Now that we covered the whole leaf with local coordinates52, it is an easy task to integrate over it.
The main purpose is to verify the completeness relation (67) and the quantization of the xaas in
equation (66). Accordingly, we perform the following steps.
•Wecovertheleafwithcoordinates x
i1:::ilasaboveandalsocalculatethecorrespondingJacobians
J
i1:::il, whereis the index of the (nonempty) tile T. We deﬁne I(x
i1:::il)as one ifx
i1:::il2T
and zero otherwise, implementing a discrete version of a partition of unity.
•Since our volume form is deﬁned as 
L=1
(l=2)!!^l=2
L, we calculate the pullback of !Mto the
leaf. In our coordinates, we have
!
st(i1;:::;il) =X

(where at least for the symplectic leaf and the hybrid leaf based on !abthese!
stare guaranteed
to be nondegenerate).
•Let nowfbe a map from the leaf to a vector space. Then, we ﬁnd the numerical approximation

noting that every point (i1;:::;il)represents a unit volume in Rl.
•If we want to use f(q(x)) =jxihxj, then all we need to do is calculate jx
i1:::ilifor allx
i1:::il,
while forf(q(x)) =xajxihxjwe additionally need xa(x
i1:::il). Forf(q(x)) = 1, we simply ﬁnd
thesymplectic volume of the leaf.
We once again consider the squashed fuzzy sphere for N= 4and= 0:1.
We deﬁne the quantization of 1L(up to a proportionality factor)
10:=Z
L
Ljihj (130)
as well as the quantization of xa(again up to a proportionality factor)
(X0)a:=Z

and the symplectic volume
V!=Z
L
L= tr( 10); (132)
where hereLis the hybrid leaf through x= (1;2;1). Since we have the relation

(2)l=2V!=N (133)
52Here, we used the step length 0:05. This will be the generic choice in most later examples, although weighted with
the quotient of the respective jxj.
56for the constant (that is not related to the squashing parameter) in equation (2.2.7),
this completely ﬁxes the proportionality factor from above toN
V!.
Numerically, we ﬁnd V!= 10:515and consequently = 2:390.
According to the above, we suspect theN
V!10?=1(assuming that the completeness relation (67) holds).
We ﬁnd the mean of the eigenvalues ofN
V!10to be10= 1:000(what is clear by construction) with
a standard deviation of 10= 0:139, so the result is promising. Alternatively, we ﬁnd the relative
deviationd10:=kN
V!10 1kHS=k1kHS= 0:121.
Now, we come to the veriﬁcation of equation (66) (the quantization of the xa): We thus suspect
N
V!(X0)a?=Xa. Similarlyasbefore, weconsidertherelativedeviation53kN
V!X0 (Xa)kHS0=k(Xa)kHS0
= 0:422which is not very encouraging. Thus, we look at n1:=kN
V!X0kHS0=(DN2) = 0:020and
n2:=k(Xa)kHS0=(DN2) = 0:034and consequently nX0:=n2
n1= 1:7251, so the previous result
is not surprising. So we may still hope and suspect nX0N
V!(X0)a?=Xa. Here, we ﬁnd the relative
deviationdX0:=knX0N
V!X0 (Xa)kHS0=k(Xa)kHS0= 0:058– which looks much better.
3.3.7 The Minimization of 
Yet, there is a vast choice of initial points x2~RD, while of course not all belong to the same leaf.
Thus, having a unique rule to select a leaf via some initial point would be welcome.
A natural choice is to try to approximately minimize . This in turn means that @awill be small
and consequently by equation (44) xawill be near xa.
On the other hand, it is not advisable to search for the global minimum of . We should rather ﬁnd
a minimum inNx. Since we are working with leaves, it would be even better to actually work with
NL
x.
In our framework, it is not hard to concretize these objects introduced in section 2.4: Since we have
a distribution in the tangent bundle that describes the leaf L, we can simply use the orthogonal
complement V?
x(coming with the orthogonal projector (1 px)) to deﬁne a distribution that in turn
deﬁnes the generalization of NxtoNL
xwhich we call null leaf.
So, we start from a random point x2~RD, try to ﬁnd the minimum of in the null leaf at some x0
and use that point as our true initial point, deﬁning the leaf L0.
Then, we have to hope that for the sake of consistency y0also lies in (or at least near) the leaf through
x0for everyy2~RD.
For any initial x2~RD, we can use an adapted gradient descent procedure to ﬁnd x0.
•We construct a sequence xiinNL
xwithx0=xthat (hopefully) converges against a local
minimum of in the null leaf.
•Assume, we already know xi. Then, using equation (44), we calculate the gradient @a(xi) =
 (xa(xi) xa
i). In the spirit of gradient descent methods, we put vi= @a(xi).
•Then, we simply deﬁne xi+1=xi+ (1 pxi)(vi).
53Here, bykkHS0we mean the square root of the sum over the square of all components, generalizing the Hilbert-
Schmidt norm to objects with three indices.
57•For everyiwe check ifj(1 pxi)(@a(xi))j<for some cutoﬀ >0. If this holds true, we deﬁne
x0:=xi.
In ﬁgure 9 we see that our hope is not fulﬁlled and we do not ﬁnd a unique leaf by this procedure.
Yet, still this procedure might select a scale for us for choosing jxj. If this scale actually selects a leaf
of goodqualityfor us will become clearer in section 4.1.

584 The Squashed Fuzzy Sphere and Other Results
This section is dedicated to the discussion of actual numerical results for some of the matrix conﬁgu-
ration deﬁned in section 2.3 as well as a few others, based on the algorithms from section 3.
In section 4.1 the squashed fuzzy sphere is studied in more detail (compared to what we have already
seen in section 3). This is followed by section 4.2, where we add random matrices to the round fuzzy
sphere.
In section 4.3 we then turn to the squashed fuzzy CP2, our ﬁrst example with D > 3, accompanied
by the related completely squashed fuzzy CP2in section 4.4.
The ﬁnal example in section 4.5 is then given by the so called fuzzy torus T2
N, our ﬁrst example that
is not derived from a semisimple Lie group.
4.1 The Squashed Fuzzy Sphere
In section 3 we have already seen some results for the squashed fuzzy sphere (that has been introduced
in section 2.3.3) for N= 4and= 0:1;0:9. Now, we are going to study the latter geometry in more
detail, including the dependence on Nandand a detailed discussion of the results coming from the
integration overL.
This will be accompanied by several plots that allow us to understand the geometry visually.
4.1.1 First Results and Dimensional Aspects
As a beginning, we want to determine the dimension kofM(given by the rank of Txq) as well as the
ranks ofgab(x),!ab(x)andab(x). Also, we want to know which of the kernels of the latter agree and
which points lie in ~RDrespectively ^RD(note that we already know from analytic considerations that
02K).
Therefore, we perform a cascade of calculations: For the points (0;0;1),(0;1;0)as well as for three
random points in the unit ball, for N= 2;3;4;10;100and for= 1;0:5;0:1;0we check if x2^RD,
calculate the latter objects and the associated ranks and compare the kernels.
We begin with the discussion of the choice N= 2, turning out to be fundamentally diﬀerent to N > 2.
For the round case = 1we ﬁnd that all considered points lie in ~R3, while we always ﬁnd that the
dimensionkas well as all ranks equal two. This in turn shows that all these points also lie in ^R3.
Further, all kernels agree and the almost Kähler condition is satisﬁed. These results are ﬁtting well
to our knowledge dim(M) = 2and~R3=^R3=R3nf0gfrom section 2.3.2.
In the squashed cases = 0:5;0:1all considered points still lie in ~R3, the dimension and the ranks
remain at two but the kernel of abdiscerns from all the other kernels (except for (0;0;1)). The almost
Kähler condition remains intact. So we ﬁnd k= 2and conjecture ~R3=^R3=R3nf0g.
In the completely squashed case = 0we ﬁnd (0;0;1)2Kwhile the other points remain in ~R3.
The dimension of Mturns to one just as the rank of gab. Accordingly, !abandabvanish. The
kernel ofTxqandgabagree. Since !abvanishes, the almost Kähler condition is meaningless. Here, we
conjecture ~R3=^R3=R3nR^e3.
Let us now consider the more interesting choices N > 2.
In the round case = 1nothing changes and we obtain the expected results.
59For the squashed cases = 0:5;0:1we witness an interesting eﬀect (we have already stumbled upon
it in section 2.3.3) that we will call oxidation in the following. For all points except (0;0;1)the
dimension as well as the rank of gabturn to three. The ranks of !abandabremain two, while their
kernels again discern. At (0;0;1)the dimensions as well as the ranks are still two and all kernels agree.
The almost Kähler condition only remains true approximately. These observations together with our
analytic results from section 2.3.3 encourage us to conjecture ~R3=R3nf0g, while ^R3=R3nR^e3.
Also the case = 0changes: The dimension of Mand the rank of gabreturn to two with agreeing
kernels, while !abandabvanish, noting that again (0;0;1)2K. So we conjecture that also here
~R3=^R3=R3nR^e3.
These conjectures are supported by numerous further calculations. Table 2 summarizes the ﬁndings
for pointsx2R3nR^e3.
Let us explain heuristically why these results are plausible: In section 2.3.6 we have seen that kis
bounded from above by min(D;2N 2), explaining why we ﬁnd no oxidation for N= 2. Again by
arguments from the same section it is expected that k= 3forN > 2under the assumption that the
squashed fuzzy sphere already behaves like a random matrix conﬁguration . In section 2.3.3 we have
even seen analytically that k= 3at least for = 1 for small>0. Further, complete squashing
eﬀectively reduces Dfrom three to two, again supporting the validity of the ﬁndings.
That the behaviour is special on the ^e3axis ﬁts to the fact that the SO(3)symmetry remains unbroken
for rotations around this axis and that analytically the quasi-coherent states are unperturbed there.

Table 2: Overview of the dimensions and ranks in diﬀerent scenarios for points x2R3nR^e3
We further refer to the comparison of gaband!abonce calculated numerically and once via pertur-
bation theory in section 3.1, mutually validating both approaches. This has also been checked for
further scenarios.
4.1.2 A Graphical Account
In ﬁgure 10 we see plots of Mand ~Mfor random points in the (squashed) fuzzy sphere for N= 4
and for= 1;0:1;0.
Looking atM, we immediately witness self-intersections of the shape. This is not surprising since we
projected from R6toR3in order to generate the plots. Also, the large scale shape depends strongly on
the choice of a projection P. On the other hand we see that this large scale shape is preserved during
the squashing. This is not surprising as we have seen in section 2.3.3 that the quasi coherent states
of the round fuzzy sphere remain as asymptotic states of the squashed fuzzy sphere for 0<< 1.
While in the plots of Mit is hardly possible to recognize the actual geometry, that is very present in
the plots of ~M. In the round case, the result exactly is a sphere54, while for= 0:1we approximately
54Note that in these plots the ^e3axis is scaled diﬀerently than the ^e1and^e2axes!
60ﬁnd an ellipsoidal and in the completely squashed case a disc. The interesting result of course is the
squashed case where we see that points accumulate (and in fact oxidize) at the equator while at the
polar regions there are fewer points than in the round case.
Figure 10: 10000random points in the squashed fuzzy sphere for N= 4. Left to right: = 1;0:1;0;
top: projective plot of M, bottom: projective plot of ~M
In the latter ﬁgure it is hardly possible to determine kvisually. For that reason, in ﬁgure 11 the
Cartesian coordinate lines centered at (0;1;0)shown in ﬁgure 2 are plotted.
In the round case we directly see that one coordinate is always redundant, matching to our knowledge
k= 2and to our discussion55in appendix A.4.
In the squashed case, these coordinates are not redundant anymore and Mvisually turns out to be
(at least) three dimensional. Interestingly, the same holds for ~M.
In the completely squashed case we once again see that one coordinate is redundant (especially the
^e3coordinate) andMis therefore two dimensional.
Here we can also see how the large scale shape is preserved throughout the squashing, while the actual
shape strongly changes.

right:= 1;0:1;0; top: projective plot of M, bottom: projective plot of ~M
55There we found that we can construct true coordinates of Mby dropping redundant coordinates.
61For the sake of a more systematic global understanding, in ﬁgure 12 the spherical coordinate lines
from ﬁgure 2 are plotted56.
We directly see that these coordinates are better adapted to the geometry. In the round case it
is evident that the radial coordinate is redundant. Further, we immediately see that Mis three
dimensional for 0<  < 1. In the plot of ~Mwe perceive that at the poles the radial direction is
degenerate, ﬁtting to our previous observations.

1;0:1;0; top: projective plot of M, bottom: projective plot of ~M
4.1.3 The Dependence on N
We have already seen that N= 2is a special case, so we included ﬁgure 13 (which is the analogue of
ﬁgure 10). Let us ﬁrst consider the plots of ~M: The round case looks just as the one for N= 4, while
only the radius deviates, ﬁtting to equation (78). From this perspective it looks as if the same held in
the completely squashed case, but this is not true. For N= 4we obtained a disk, while here we would
only see a circle. The partially squashed case is also interesting as we again see an accumulation of
points at the equator, while here the shape is much more that of an ellipsoidal than for N= 4as
there is no oxidation.
Let us come to the plots of M. We see that the large scale shape is much simpler than for N= 4, but
we cannot recognize a sphere in the round case. This is an artifact of our plotting procedure where
we trivialized CPN 1=S2N 1=U(1). Since there is no global trivialization we cannot expect to get
a global result. Practically this means that the border of the plotted shape is given by the states in
the setZdeﬁned in section 3.2 where we could not choose a unique representative by our rule. That
the shape looks like a half sphere is merely a coincidence, while the points on the border are glued
together in a nontrivial way. Further, here we can nicely see how the squashing takes place: The
points get more and more conﬁned to a circle, while we have a complete collapse for = 0.
56Here we replaced the color yellow with orange for a better visibility.
62Figure 13: Random points in the squashed fuzzy sphere for N= 2. Left to right: = 1;0:1;0; top:
projective plot of M, bottom: projective plot of ~M
In ﬁgure 14 we see plots of MforN= 2;3;4;5;10and= 1;0:1;0. We already know that in the
round caseM=S2for allN, thus in the ﬁrst line we only see projections of diﬀerent immersions
ofS2,!CPN 1. With increasing Nthe large scale shape winds more and more around the origin,
until we lose almost all information for too large Nsince then the R3gets much too low dimensional
to capture all aspects of the immersion57.
In the squashed and completely squashed cases we see similar behaviour.
Figure 14: Random points in the squashed fuzzy sphere, projective plot of M. Left to right: N=
2;3;4;5;10; top to bottom: = 1;0:1;0
57That does not mean that it is impossible to visualize Mlocally.
634.1.4 The Dependence on and the Oxidation Process
Now we want to focus on the squashing of the fuzzy sphere. Therefore we once again specialize to
N= 4. In ﬁgure 15 we plotted58spherical coordinate lines as shown in ﬁgure 2 for exponentially
decreasing.
What we directly see is that the radial coordinate (red/cyan) does not play any role in the round
case, while in the completely squashed case the radial and the polar coordinate lines (green/magenta)
play the same role (this is clear from analytical considerations) and the top and bottom hemisphere
produce exactly the same states (which is again obvious).
For the azimuthal coordinate lines (blue/orange) one sees especially well how the upper hemisphere
moves closer to the lower hemisphere, starting at the equator where they touch.
Note that the broken symmetry between the upper and lower hemisphere is only an artifact of the
way we produced the plots via the procedure described in section 3.2.
Figure 15: Spherical coordinate lines in the squashed fuzzy sphere for N= 4. Projective plot of M.
Top: left to right: = 1;0:1;0:01; bottom: left to right: = 0:001;0:0001;0
In ﬁgure 16 we plotted a sector of spherical coordinate lines centered at the equator (this sector is
shown in ﬁgure 2). Here, we can easily trace the oxidation process and we can see remarkably well how
the upper and the lower hemisphere join together during squashing. Yet we should not think of an
upper layer hovering above a lower layer since the smaller we make , the further inwards both layers
heuristically touch. (In the next section we will see that this view is anyways completely wrong.)
These plots also allow us to visually trace the thickness ofM. For= 0:1this oxidation is at a peak
and again becomes almost irrelevant for smaller scales of .

58Again, the color yellow has been replaced with orange.
644.1.5 Asymptotic States and Topological Aspects
In order to better understand the topology of M, we want to know the behaviour for large and small
jxj.
For large absolute values this is simple since in the limit jxj!1, we can consider the asymptotic
states(that we have discussed in section 2.3.3).
In the opposite limit jxj!0it is not that trivial to ﬁnd the quasi-coherent states. Yet numerically,
we can simulate this limit by considering random points on a tiny sphere of radiusin~RD.
In ﬁgure 17 we plotted random points from the unit ball (orange), random asymptotic points59(blue)
and random points from a tiny sphere of radius 0:001(green) as well as a radial curve through a
random point (red) and a polar curve connecting the points60(0;0;1)and(0;1;0)(cyan).
For a more complete understanding ﬁgure 18 (instead of random points) shows corresponding coordi-
nate lines for the case = 0:1, while ﬁgure 19 features specially chosen radial coordinate lines together
with asymptotic spherical coordinate lines, visualizing the insideof~M.
We can make a number of observations:
•In the round case we see that the asymptotic states, the random states and the states from a
tiny sphere agree. The radial curve shrinks to a point. All this is fairly obvious as in the round
case the quasi-coherent states do not depend on the radius.
•For all squashed cases 0<< 1the asymptotic states recover the round case, but the distribu-
tionof the points changes strongly. In the plots of ~M, the asymptotic states form an ellipsoidal
that is squashed according to the factor compared to the round case.
The plots in ﬁgure 18 suggest that the states at jxj= 1discern only slightly from the asymptotic
states, while the radial and the polar coordinate lines behave similarly. On the other hand, in
the right plot we see that there are radial coordinate lines that terminate at the origin.
Figure 19 resolves the discrepancy: The latter are exactly those with x3= 0, while forjxjjx3j,
the radial coordinate lines tend to behave like polar coordinate lines. Only for jxjjx3j, the
radial coordinate lines come near to the origin, before they drift oﬀ to a pole.
From that we conclude that in ~M, the whole inside (with respect to the asymptotic states) is
ﬁlled except from the ^e3axis itself61, while unless 1jxjx3the states are strongly conﬁned
to the asymptotic states.
•In the completely squashed case the asymptotic states form a one dimensional manifold and M
turns two dimensional again. In the plots of ~Mthis assembles to a disk where the center is
coming from the ^e3axis (omitting 0) in~RD, while the points on the tiny sphere in ~RDlie in a
tiny disk around the origin. The border of the whole disk is given by the asymptotic states. The
radial and the polar coordinate lines in ~RDboth behave identically as radial lines in the disk.
•Note that the gap in between the blue and the orange points is only an artifact of the fact that
the random points are conﬁned to the unit ball in R3.
The discussion of the actual thickness of the auxiliary direction in the squashed case will be addressed
in the following section.
59This means, we calculated the corresponding asymptotic states in favor of the quasi-coherent states.
60Prior knowledge tells us that the point (0;1;0)is at the end of the cyan curve that is lower with respect to the print
for the plots ofMrespectively higher for the plots of ~M.
61Since 02Kand the rest of the axis is in N^e3, only two points lie on the ^e3axis in ~M, distinguished by a relative
sign.

4.1.6 Foliations, Adapted Coordinates and Integration – The Prototypical Result
Now, we turn to foliations of Mthat allow us to calculate adapted coordinates and to integrate
over a chosen leaf L. That enables us to check the completeness relation and similar properties. In
this section, we present the prototypical results for the following choices: We put N= 4,= 0:9,
x= (1;2;1)(what speciﬁes the actual leaf in the foliation) and use the hybrid leaf.
In the following section, we will then discuss what changes if we modify these parameters or use
diﬀerent leaves.
66In section 3.3.2 we have already seen that the leaves are (approximately) integrable for these choices,
so we directly turn to the global discussion.
In ﬁgure 20 we see a covering with coordinates of the hybrid leaf through x. Once again, we note
how well the leaf is integrable, especially already in ~RD. In the plot ofMwe recognize the large scale
shape that we know from the previous sections, while we now look at a two dimensional manifold
LM. Here the diﬀerent colors (corresponding to diﬀerent tiles) allow us to understand how the
shape can be entangled and conﬁrms that the plot only looks so complicated because the plotting
procedure from section 3.2 maps diﬀerent regions in CPN 1onto another. The plot of ~Malready
looks very much like an ellipsoidal.

Now we can leave the qualitative discussion behind in favor of quantitative results.
Our ﬁrst interest lies on the completeness relation . We ﬁnd that the leaf has the symplectic volume
V!= 10:058. According to section 3.3.6 we considerN
V!10, representing Q(1M), which has eigenvalues
1:025;1:013;0:991;0:971. If the completeness relation (67) holds, all eigenvalues should equal 1, so the
results are not far away from that.
To quantify the deviation, we look at the standard deviation62of the eigenvalues that is given by
10= 0:024. Another measure is the relative deviation ofN
V!10to1with respect to the Hilbert-
Schmidt norm, turning out to be d10= 0:021.
Let us turn to the quantization of the embedding functions xa. Here we look at nX0N
V!X0from section
3.3.6, representing nX0(Q(xa))for the proportionality constant nX0. If equation (32) holds, this
should agree with (Xa). Explicitly, we ﬁnd the relative deviation dX0= 0:025with the correction
factornX0= 1:668, which is pretty good.

As a measure for the compatibility of the respective Poisson structures we deﬁne the relative deviation
dfg:=k(fxa;xbg ( 2)ab)kHS0=k(fxa;xbg)kHS0= 0:00014, which is remarkably good.
For the others it suﬃces to look at the eigenvalues of the (lhs)(they should be given by 1with
multiplicity l0and0withmultiplicity D l0, wherel0isthesymplecticdimensionof M). Explicitly, the
eigenvalues of 2!abbcand@axbare given by 0:088;0:088;0:000respectively 0:319;0:277;0:000047.
So in both cases the conjectures are heavily violated. But as we are far away from the local minima
of(x)this is not astonishing at all and we will come back to this in the following section when we
look at the dependence on x.
62By construction we have the mean 10= 1.
67Further, it is interesting to look at the Kähler cost of the subspace VL:=VxTxRDcoming from
the distribution corresponding to the leaf.
As the result is only a number of generic scale we compare it to the cost of a random subspace
VRTxRDand the optimal Kähler subspace VKTxRD(both of the same dimension as VL).
Accordingly, we ﬁnd63c2(VR) = 0:077,c2(VL) = 0:0010andc2(VK) = 0:000062. This means that the
hybrid leaf is rather well optimized with respect to the Kähler cost (compared to a random subspace),
while it is still far away from the absolute optimum.
In order to arrive at the speciﬁc VK(there are plenty of local minima of c2that lie even higher
thanc2(VL)) it was necessary to start from twenty diﬀerent random subspaces for which the gradient
descent method was performed. This makes the ﬁnding of the optimal subspace for the Kähler leaf
even harder (we have already mentioned that the computational eﬀort is rather high right from the
beginning) and untrustworthy. On the other hand, the results on the Kähler cost are interesting on
their own.
We then come to another interesting question, namely the thickness ofMin the directions orthogonal
to the leafNL
x.
We address the question via the following attempt: First, we calculate the length64lLof a curve in
the leaf starting at xthat approximately goes once around the origin. This gives us a reference length
scale. Then we calculate the lengths lIandlOof two curves in the null leaf NL
xstarting at x– one
going inwards (we let it terminate shortly before we arrive at the origin) and one going outwards.
This setup is shown in ﬁgure 21, where we additionally plotted spherical coordinate lines and a radial
coordinate line through xfor a better orientation.
We ﬁnd the lengths lL= 5:323,lI= 0:891andlO= 0:0061. This means, that the outwards pointing
curve is of negligible length, while the inwards pointing one acquires a ﬁnite length. This means we
should not think of Mas extremely thin in the direction of the null leaf, even for = 0:9. It turns
out that the greatest contribution comes from the vicinity of the origin, ﬁtting to the observation that
in the round case gabdiverges forjxj!0. Thus it is hard to say how sensitive lIis to the chosen
endpoint of the curve and the results should be considered cautiously.
While the quantitative result is not very enlightening, the qualitative results in the ﬁgure are inter-
esting. In the left plot we see that the radial curve is almost identical with the inward pointing curve.
On the other hand, considering the right plot, we note that in ~Mthe two curves discern strongly as
the radial curve terminates at the north pole, while the inwards pointing curve heads to the origin.
Finally, a short comment on the numerical quality of the results is due.
Whiletheveriﬁcationofthecompletenessrelationandthequantizationofthe xadependsonnumerical
integration over the constructed leaf (and thus on a ﬁnite step length, here taken to be 0:05) the results
on the compatibility of the Poisson structures and the conjectures  2!abbc?=pc
aand@axb?=pb
aare
calculated at the point x. So for the latter three we should expect a much lower numerical deviation
from the exact results than for the ﬁrst two.
While the Kähler cost of VLshould be of descent numerical quality, the cost of VRdepends on a
random choice and the determination of VKis problematic itself.
Concerning the thickness, we have already stated that the lengths lLandlOare rather unproblematic,
while the length lIstrongly depends on the exact endpoint.
63From now on we omit the xincs
xandroundresults by the following scheme: In principle we keep three digits behind
the comma unless the number is too small. Then we round such that we keep two nonzero digits. If the result is
smaller than 10 5we only show its scale.

4.1.7 Foliations, Adapted Coordinates and Integration – Dependence on Parameters
Having seen the prototypical result for N= 4,= 0:9,x= (1;2;1)in the hybrid leaf, we now look at
the dependence of the results on these parameters. Thus we subsequently vary ,N,xand the leaf
while holding the other parameters ﬁxed.
As a beginning, we look at the dependence on the squashing parameter and calculate the respective
quantities from the last section for = 1;0:9;0:5;0:1. The most important results are listed in the
tables 3 and 4.
Let us brieﬂy focus on the round case. There we would expect 10=d10=dX0=dfg=c2(VR) =
c2(VL) =c2(VK) =lI=lO= 0. This turns out to hold true up to numerical deviations. The size of
these deviations perfectly ﬁts the discussion at the end of the last section.
The symplectic volume V!is almost independent of , while the quality of the completeness relation
and the quantization of the xais high in the round case and decreases with increasing . For example
for= 0:5the results are still tolerable, while for = 0:1d10>10%.
The correction factor nX0seems to be almost independent of with a slight tendency to increase with
decreasing.
The compatibility of the two Poisson structures holds remarkably well until = 0:5, but for= 0:1
we can clearly see a violation.
Now, we come to the Kähler cost: For all three subspaces, the cost increases with , while the dis-
crepancy between c2(VL)andc2(VK)grows worse with decreasing . Still, in all cases the subspace
VLis much better conditioned than the random subspace.
Looking at the thickness, we witness an interesting behaviour: While in the round case lIandlO
vanish, the values of lIjumps immediately from 0to approximately 1and then remains almost ﬁxed.
This meansMinstantly grows thick in the auxiliary dimension when going away from = 1. The
lengthlOon the other hand slowly increases with decreasing , meaning that even for small the
quasi-coherent states at x= (1;2;1)are notfar away from the asymptotic states.
We conclude that most of the appreciated properties of the round fuzzy sphere are preserved ap-
proximately during the squashing, while the quality decreases with . Only the thickness jumps
immediately when leaving the round case. This suggests a stable behaviour of the construction under
squashing.

Figure 22 shows plots for = 0:1that are the analogues to the ones in ﬁgure 20. We see that the
shape in ~RDdoes not change strongly, while Mlooks slightly diﬀerent (comparable to the results of
section 4.1.4). ~Mlooks like a squashed sphere (an ellipsoidal) as we would expect heuristically. Also
these graphical results support the conjectured stability of the construction under squashing as the
dimension ofL(and thus the local structure) is preserved.

Let us discuss the dependence on N. In the tables 5 and 6 the most relevant quantities are displayed
forN= 2;3;4;10;100.
Here,N= 2turns out to be the special case where the same quantities vanish numerically as before
for= 1.
We deduce that the symplectic volume follows the rule V!(N 1)3:4. We might explain the
numerical factor by 3:41
2(2), although the deviation is rather large. The additional factor1
2
is related to the fact that we should actually replace !7! 1
2!(as discussed in section 2.2.2), while
thenV!2Nand1for largeNas suggested in [1].
For the completeness relation and the quantization of xawe ﬁnd that the quality slightly decreases
withNbut stagnates for large N. We will come back to that in a moment.
The correction factor follows the simple rule nX0N+1
N 1(which exactly is j(xa)j 2in the round case).
The compatibility of the Poisson structures at ﬁrst gets worse with increasing Nbut forN= 100it
is again much better.
For the Kähler costs of VLandVR, we ﬁnd a similar behaviour. For VKthe result is paradoxical since
forN= 10;100the cost is higherthan forVL. This is once again related to the fact that c2does not
have a unique local minimum. This problem shows to increase with N.
Further, we ﬁnd that all three lengths lL,lIandlOincrease with N. ForlL, we ﬁnd the dependence
70lL/p
N 1(this is just ﬁne as the symplectic volume showed to scale with N 1). If we correct for
this rescaling, both lIandlOdecrease again for large N.
Let us come back to the discussion of the quality of the completeness relation and the quantization
of the xa. We have already seen that the relative deviation approximately stagnates for large N.
We now assume thatN
V!10=1+CwhereCis the constant matrix with entries c. This models a
constant error per component . Under this assumption, we ﬁnd the relative deviation

This result suggests that if d10is approximately constant with N, the error per component scales with
c/N 1
2and thus the quality in fact increases withN.
So, we conclude that for our actual results the quality of the completeness relation improves like N 1
2
in the large Nlimit.
Similar arguments can be made for the quantization of the xa.
Under these considerations we conclude that the large Nlimit is likely to restore the results from the
round case, although for smaller Nthe behaviour is vice versa.

4 1
4+1, being consistent with the result from the round case, which is
discussed in section 2.3.2.
The most relevant quantities65are provided in table 7.
Also here, we ﬁnd a special case (that is x= 100x0) where the same quantities almost vanish as
before for= 1. Consequently, we therefore conjecture that for jxj!1(meaning we work with the
asymptotic states) the round case is recovered. This would ﬁt to the observation that the asymptotic
states are exactly the quasi-coherent states from the round case. Nevertheless, !abin principle does
not have to be the same. Yet in appendix C we have seen that in the round case !abjxj 2, while

71in the squashed case the ﬁrst perturbation !0
abjxj 3. Thus, the latter is negligible compared to the
unperturbed !abin the limit, making the behaviour at least plausible.
Here, we ﬁnd that the symplectic volume and the correction factor nX0are almost independent of x,
while the quality of the completeness relation and the quantization of xagets worse and worse with
decreasing66jxj.
Also the compatibility of the diﬀerent Poisson structures and all three Kähler costs grow worse with
decreasingjxj.
This leads us to the conclusion that the quality is better for large jxjand that the approach to take
the leaf through xas default is not promising for the squashed fuzzy sphere.
Finally, we once again come back to the conjectures  2!abbc?=pc

posed to hold if is minimal, so they should hold at x. Here, we ﬁnd the eigenvalues of  2!abbc

diﬀerent. ~Malmost remains unchanged. This supports the interpretation of the null leafs NL

the points that minimize over the null leaves approximately lie on a single hybrid leaf. Thus here,

Let us ﬁnally come to the dependence on the chosen leaf, an important discussion that hopefully
guides us to a preferred method. We look at the following leaves67: the hybrid leaf (H), the hybrid
leaf using!(O), the hybrid leaf using !andg(G), the Pfaﬃan leaf (P) and the Kähler leaf (K). The
tables 8 and 9 show the most interesting quantities while some are missing for P and K (for these
some quantities have not been calculated due to the large computational eﬀort for these two leaves).
From the three implemented hybrid leaves (H, O and G) – these are the ones which are rather less
computationally demanding – we ﬁnd that the results discern only slightly, yet they are best for G.
The results obtained by P are catastrophically bad. This is caused by the enormous computational
expense of this leaf that made it necessary to rely on much fewer points in the integration. Since we
have seen in section 3.3.2 that P is almost identical to H for the squashed fuzzy sphere, we should be
able to arrive at adequate results in principle. Nevertheless, the needed computational eﬀort forces us
to discard P. For K almost the same holds, although the eﬀort is not as large. Although here we used
fewer points for the integration (compared to the hybrid methods) the results are remarkably good.
Due to the unreliability discussed in the previous section, we nonetheless discard K.
We ﬁnally conclude that all hybrid leaves generate acceptable and comparable results, but at least for
the squashed fuzzy sphere G is the superior choice.

67The symplectic leaf is omitted since most of the relevant procedures have not been implemented on Mathematica due
to the fact that the leaf is not promising for arbitrary geometries as discussed in section 2.4.

Let us shortly summarize what we have learned in this section.
We concluded that the quality reduces with decreasing , decreasingjxjand increasing N– while for
largeNthe quality improves again.
Further, all three hybrid leaves produce good results while the hybrid leaf using !andgturns out to
be preferable.

4.2 The Fuzzy Sphere and Random Matrices
We now deﬁne a new matrix conﬁguration that is partially random. Here, we pick three random

the matrix conﬁguration68
S2
N;;R := Xa+ (1 )Ra
(141)
where the Xaare the matrices from the round fuzzy sphere S2
N. Here, we might speak of the perturbed

75In ﬁgure 27 (that should be compared to ﬁgure 10 for the squashed fuzzy sphere) we see plots of
random points for = 0:9; 1. In the case of = 0:9we can still recognize the perturbed shape of
the round sphere, while for  1we can hardly see any geometry.

Figure 28 (here, we should compare to ﬁgure 11) shows Cartesian coordinate lines. We note that even
in the completely random case = 1, the coordinate lines look smooth, while for = 0:9we can
still recognize the shape of the round case. For both choices it is evident that Mis three dimensional.

4.2.2 Foliations and Integration
In this section, we want to look at foliations of M, while keeping the hybrid leaf as default. Our ﬁrst
task is to check if the leaf is still integrable.
In ﬁgure 29 we see two diﬀerent curves in the hybrid leaf starting from the same initial point. For
= 0:9we ﬁnd that the curves visually intersect away from the initial point both in ~RDandM, while
76for= 0:7it is clear that the curves miss each other in ~RDbut still intersect69inM.
Therefore we conclude that the hybrid leaf is still integrable, however only in Mbut no longer in
~RD. So the integrability in ~RDfor the squashed fuzzy sphere was only a consequence of the special
geometry.

Knowing about the integrability of the leaf, we are ready to generate global coverings with coordinates.
As our reference conﬁguration we take N= 4,= 0:9,x= (1;2;1)and the hybrid leaf. Figure 30
shows the plots in analogy to ﬁgure 20. Here, we recognize the shape from ﬁgure 28.

Let us now discuss the dependence on the parameter . Table 11 shows the most relevant quantities
for= 1;0:9;0:7.
Of course, for = 1, we reproduce the results from section 4.1 for = 1, given in table 3. Also for
= 0:9, the results for the completeness relation are comparable to the respective result for = 0:9,
while the quality of the quantization of xais worse. The same holds for the compatibility of the
Poisson structures and the Kähler properties. By decreasing further, the results impair even more.
In total, we conclude that the results are better for higher , while the quantization of xaworks worse
than for the squashed fuzzy sphere.
69This can be seen much better directly in Mathematica when it is possible to adjust the viewpoint.

In ﬁgure 31 we see a covering with coordinates for = 0:7. Here the deviation from the round sphere
is already much stronger and it is plain to see that the leaf is not integrable in ~RD. Also the shape in
Mis now far away from the well studied round case.

We now come to the dependence on N. In table 12, the relevant quantities are listed for N= 4;10;20.
We see that V!still follows the rule in equation (136). On the other hand, the results are getting
much poorer already for N= 10, while it is not foreseeable that they start to improve again for larger
N.
If we view the perturbations Rato the Xaas gauge ﬁelds as proposed in [7], the discussion in [1]
suggests that we should only consider perturbations that are in some sense considered as almost
local(respectively in the regime we touched upon in section 2.2.7). For the fuzzy sphere that means
to impose a cutoﬀ on the allowed SU(2)modes in the Raof orderO(p
N)(or equivalently, only
considering polynomials of order O(p
N)in the Xa) [1]. Since by the discussion in section 2.1.2
random matrices will include all modes up to order N 1, it is no wonder that for large Nthe results
are far from optimal, yet it remains to check if a restriction to almost local random matrices improves
the quality.

In that context, increasing Nmeans that we add more and more modes to the gauge ﬁelds. This
behaviour can be seen very well in ﬁgure 32. We can nicely observe how the degrees of freedom grow
withN, letting the shape become more and more complicated, changing on a shorter and shorter
length scale.
The plot for N= 20further makes it crystal clear that the leaf is no longer integrable in ~RD.

Now, we discuss the dependence on x. In table 13, the relevant results are shown for x= 100
x0;x0;0:1x0;x, wherex0= (1;2;1)andx=x0
0is the point inNL
x0that minimizes .
At ﬁrst we note that x= (0:339;0:651;0:278)0:320x0and there, the eigenvalues of  2!abbc
and@axaare given by 1:127;1:217;0respectively 1:274;1:024;0:015, which is approximately what we
would expect from section 2.2.7 (although the results are worse than the comparable results for the
squashed fuzzy sphere).
On the other hand, we observe that the results for the completeness relation and the quantization of
thexaare best for x0, while the results for the compatibility of the diﬀerent Poisson structures is
better forx. Yet for 0:1x0, the results are already very bad.
We conclude that the behaviour is fundamentally diﬀerent from the squashed fuzzy sphere where we
obtained the optimal results for larger and larger jxj, while here the optimal results can be found in
the vicinity of xandx0.

Let us ﬁnally discuss the dependence on the leaf. Table 14 collects the most important results for the
hybrid leaf (H), the hybrid leaf using !(O) and the hybrid leaf using !andg(G).
We see that the results are almost identical for H and O, while they are much worse for G. This
is curious since for the squashed fuzzy sphere the latter method produced the best results. Yet, the
explanation is simple: For G the constructed coordinates have a much smaller range where they behave
well(i.e. there are no self-intersections or strong accumulations), thus providing a covering with global
coordinates is much harder and more susceptible for numerical errors. The same happens for O when
Ngrows large, while the coordinates obtained by H are still well behaved.

In ﬁgure 33 we see what can possibly go wrong when constructing coordinates for the leaves. While
the hybrid leaf using !is more resilient than the hybrid leaf using !andg(in the ﬁrst case we have
to go toN= 20until we ﬁnd such problems, but they are present already for N= 4in the second
case), for both leaves we encounter situations where the coordinates intersect or accumulate.
On the other hand, the projective plots of ~Msuggest that in principle it should be possible to pick a
ﬁner tiling to circumvent the problems, meaning we pick more but smaller coordinate charts.

Such reﬁned charts are shown in ﬁgure 34. These have been used to calculate the results in table 14.
It is no wonder that there is more room for numerical errors. Yet, it is in principle possible to improve
the results by constructing coordinates with shorter step lengths and more coordinate points.

804.3 The Squashed Fuzzy CP2
Until now, we have only studied matrix conﬁgurations for D= 3. Thus, it is time to look at a higher
dimensional example, namely the squashed fuzzy CP2withD= 8. The round case has been discussed
in section 2.3.5.
The general squashed fuzzy CP2is then deﬁned as the matrix conﬁguration
CP2
n;a= (1X1;2X2;3X3;4X4;5X5;6X6;7X7;8X8) =: (Xa) (143)
(where the Xaare the matrices from the round fuzzy CP2), for arbitrary parameters a0, while
we mostly restrict ourselves to the special case
CP2
n;= (X1;X2;X3;X4;X5;X6;X7;X8); (144)
for a single 0, where we only modify the Cartan generators X3and X8as we have done for the
squashed fuzzy sphere.
4.3.1 First Results and Dimensional Aspects
We start with an incomplete discussion of ~RD. In section 2.3.5 we have seen that in the round case
forn= 1all points in R+
0^e8lie withinK. This remains true for all nand for all 01, but not
for random a.
In table 15, the dimension of Mand the ranks of gab,!abandabare given for randomly chosen
points. In the round case, we ﬁnd that the dimension as well as all ranks are four for all n. Further,
the kernels of Txq,gaband!abagree, while the kernel of abdiscerns in general.
When squashing, we have to treat the case n= 1(the fundamental representation) separately. This is
analogous to the special case N= 2for the squashed fuzzy sphere. There, we see the same behaviour
as in the round case.
Yet forn>1the behaviour is diﬀerent. Here the dimension of Mand the ranks of gaband!abjump
to eight, while the rank of abgoes to six.

= 0 6 6 6 6

Table 15: Overview of the dimensions and ranks in diﬀerent scenarios
Now we consider the special point x= (0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0). Table 16 shows the values analogous to the
ones in table 15 for x. Here, we see a completely diﬀerent behaviour compared to randomly chosen
points: In the round case nothing changes, but for n>1and0<1the dimension of M,gaband
!abare reduced, while for abthis only holds true for = 0. Considering random a, only the rank
81of!abis reduced.
Thus we conclude that x =2^RDfor01butx2^RDfor= 1and random a. So, this behaviour
very much compares to the behaviour at the special point (0;0;1)for the squashed fuzzy sphere.

Table 16: Overview of the dimensions and ranks in diﬀerent scenarios for x= (0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0)
Coming back to random points in ~RD, in the squashed cases the behaviour of the dimension of M
and the ranks of gaband!abcan very well be explained by the discussion of section 2.3.6, assuming
that the matrix conﬁguration behaves randomly itself, yet this does not explain why the rank of ab
is bounded by six in all cases. To solve this riddle, we look at a group theoretical explanation.
By deﬁnition, we have
ab=1
ihxj[aXa;bXb]jxi=X
cabfabchxjXcjxi; (145)
where the so called structure constants fabcare deﬁned via [Xa;Xb] =:P
c1
CnifabcXc.
Since all Xa2su(3), also the vector :=P
chxjXcjxiXc2su(3).
Let us now consider the adjoint representation of , given by  := ad(). Due to ad(Xc)(Xb) =
[Xc;Xb] =P
a1
CnifcbaXa, we ﬁnd the components of ()abin the basis Xa
()ab=X
chxjXcjxiad(Xc)ab=X
chxjXcjxi1
Cnifcba: (146)
On the other hand, for sure is an eigenvector of with eigenvalue zero – we insert into the deﬁnition
() = ad()() = [;] = 0– thus the rank of is bounded by seven.
Using the complete antisymmetry of the fabcforsu(3)and introducing the matrix P= (aab), we
ﬁnd
ab= Cn(PP)ab: (147)
But since the rank of is bounded by seven, the same holds for ab, as multiplication with Pfrom
the left and right does not increase the rank. By antisymmetry, this means that the rank of abis
bounded by six.
In ﬁgure 35 we can see plots of Mand ~Mthat show Cartesian coordinate lines in the directions ^e1,
^e2and^e3in~RDforn= 2.
If we compare the plots of ~Mto the corresponding plots in ﬁgure 11, we can see that some of the
structure of the squashed fuzzy sphere is preserved in the squashed fuzzy CP2.
Here we can also witness that whilst squashing the dimension of Mgrows larger.

Figure 36 shows a similar plot for n= 5and Cartesian coordinate lines centered at a random point.
Here, we can see very well how the large scale structure is preserved during squashing, while in detail
there are signiﬁcant changes taking place.

4.3.2 A Global View
In ﬁgure 37 we see Cartesian coordinate lines in the directions ^e2,^e4and^e6in~RDthat reach approx-
imately from 1:5to1:5, a much larger sector than the one shown in ﬁgure 36. While the plots of M
are too much entangled to give a good understanding of the geometry, the plots of ~Mare enlightening.
For= 1we can see a sphere, while for smaller the plots look very much like what we have seen
for the squashed fuzzy sphere in section 4.1, although, there we used diﬀerent coordinate lines. Also
for random a, we see a similar behaviour, yet it compares to a very strong squashing.
For the visualization of ~Mwe had to project from R8toR3and considered only points in a three
dimensional subspace of ~R8(and correspondingly for M), meaning we do not know how Mand ~M
look in diﬀerent directions.
Therefore, the same plots as in ﬁgure 37 are shown in ﬁgure 38, yet the direction ^e2has been replaced
with ^e1. Here, the large scale shape looks completely diﬀerent, while the local structure can be very
well compared to the previous perspective.

The left and middle plot in ﬁgure 39 show sliced plots for = 1in the respective directions shown
in ﬁgures 37 and 38 for random points in the unit ball. These conﬁrm that the apparent large scale
shapes are not merely a result of considering points in a three dimensional subspace of ~R8only, but
rather represent the intersection of ~Mwith the respective planes in R8.
Yet the shapes are washed out a bit. This is due to the needed tolerance in the calculation of sliced
plots as described in section 3.2.
The right plot in ﬁgure 39 shows random points in the plane spanned by ^e1;^e4;^e6that make the shape
in ﬁgure 38 for = 1better visible.

844.3.3 Eﬀective Dimension, Foliations and Integration
Before we can do anything else, we need to determine the eﬀective dimension lofM. For the fuzzy
sphere, the only possible choice had been l= 2, while here in principle we only know l2f2;4;6;8g.
In the round case we know that l= 4and we would readily expect that this generalizes also to the
squashed cases, but this is a good opportunity to check if the methods that we have developed so far
work properly.
In table 17 various quantities related to the diﬀerent leaves are listed for x= (1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0)and
n= 3that should allow us to determine lfor= 1;0:9;01respectively for random a.
Before we go into the discussion, we note that here it is obvious why the symplectic leaf cannot be a
good choice for the squashed fuzzy CP2: In general, the rank of !abis eight, meaning that there will
only be one leaf that ﬁlls the whole M.
We start with the Pfaﬃan method. In section 2.4.2, we described how to choose l. There we said
that we should calculate vs
x;max (x)for all possible sand then choose las large as possible so that
vs
x;max (x)0. Looking at the table this means in all cases that l= 4, just as we expected.
The Kähler method works in a rather similar way, but here we calculate vs
x;min (x)and choose las the
largest possible ssuch thatvs
x;max (x)0. Here we can see once again how unreliable the method is,
in factvs
x;max (x)should always increase with sand not decrease. Still there is a tendency to l= 4,
while the matter is much less clear compared to the Pfaﬃan method.
Alsoforthehybridleaveswedescribedawaytodetermine l: Wechooseitastheamountofeigenvalues
iofabrespectively !abwithjij0. In all cases, this means l= 4.
We conclude that l= 4, becoming less and less obvious with decreasing .

Table 17: Determination of the eﬀective dimension for n= 3andx= (1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0). Note that
the eigenvalues0:000are only identically zero for = 1
Now that we know that l= 4, we can construct local coordinates70forM. Figure 40 features plots
of two directions of such coordinates for n= 2around the point (1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0). We can see that
these coordinates are well behaved .
70In principle it would be good to check if the leaves are integrable. In higher dimensions this is a diﬃcult task. Still,
on the one hand we can argue that the results for the fuzzy sphere were promising and on the other hand we can
substantiate the assumption with our results a posteriori.

Figure 41 shows similar coordinates for n= 5around a random point. Here, we note that the large
scale shape winds itself strongly in the plot of M. This is also the reason why the surface in the plot
of~RDis less curved than the one in ﬁgure 40: Here, the step length has been chosen much smaller in
order to produce a plot of coordinates where it is visible that they are not self-intersecting.
Figure 41: Two dimensions of local coordinates around a random point in the hybrid leaf in the
squashed fuzzy CP2forn= 5and= 0:1. Left: projective plot of ~RD, right: projective plot of M
The next step is to integrate over Mand to look at the usual quantities. The tables 18 and 19 show
the dependence of these quantities on andN.
Yet, there is a caveat: For D > 3andl >2a few systematic problems arise that either make the
calculations more computationally demanding or less precise.
ForD > 3we ﬁrst ﬁnd that the visualizations of ~RDand ~Mcease to be faithful and it therefore
is harder to estimate the quality of local coordinates what in turn makes it more diﬃcult to select
the appropriate number of points and step length. Also, if one wants to use a similar tiling as for
the squashed fuzzy sphere, 2Dtiles are needed. This implies we have to calculate many more local
coordinates.
Ifl >2this means that the total number of coordinate points is given by the number of points in
each direction to the power of l. Thus, we can either enlarge the step length or calculate signiﬁcantly
more points. Also, the higher dimension of the coordinates makes it harder to judge their quality.
In total, this means that either the computational cost is much larger or the quality suﬀers.
In the apparent calculations a compromise has been chosen. This means that the step length has been
increased strongly with respect to the squashed fuzzy sphere and some tiles are not ﬁlled completely,
still resulting in a signiﬁcantly longer computational time. Thus, the results should not be taken too
serious, while further computations with stronger hardware could be promising.
Additionally, numerical problems occurred for = 1. Consequently we replaced 17!0:99. The scan
has still been calculated for = 1since this showed better success.
86We brieﬂy discuss the results, ﬁrst for the dependence on .
Here, we see that the symplectic volume V!strongly depends on . This is in strict contrast to the
squashed fuzzy sphere. Yet, it is not clear if this is only due to the fact that not all tiles are ﬁlled and
thusV!is incorrect or if this is systematically true.
For the completeness relation and the quantization of the xawe see that the quality for =
0:99;0:9;0:5is rather good, but hardly acceptable for = 0:1For random athe results are again
a bit better. The quality for = 0:99is not overwhelming, which is a consequence of the earlier
described numerical problems.
The compatibility of the diﬀerent Poisson structure is rather bad for smaller and terrible for random
a. For the Kähler properties we ﬁnd a diﬀerent behaviour as the quality of VLis once again better
for the random a.
We conclude that for the quantities that do not depend on the numerical integration we see a rather
expected behaviour, while we cannot tell exactly for the others, although the results in principle ﬁt
to the scheme we know from the squashed fuzzy sphere.

improve the quality)
Finally, we look at the dependence on n.
Here the symplectic volume V!explodes with increasing n, while the quality of the completeness
relation and the quantization of the xadecreases with n. On the one hand, we could repeat the
argument from section 4.1.7 that showed that stagnating values actually mean an improvement of the
quality with increasing N, but on the other hand, the quality is already so poor that it is hard to say
if the reasoning is still applicable.
Yet, considering the compatibility of the Poisson structures and the Kähler properties, we see a totally
diﬀerent picture: Here the quality is always decent and starts to improve for large n.
Under these considerations, it is at least plausible to assume that the bad behaviour in the ﬁrst place
is only due to the computational diﬃculty in the integration over the leaf.

4.4.1 First Results and Dimensional Aspects
At ﬁrst, we note that also here 02K. In table 20 we see the dimension of Mand the ranks of gab,
!abandabfor random points, depending on n. We ﬁnd that for n= 1all the latter are given by
four and turn to six for n >1. Once again, this can be explained by the results for random matrix
conﬁgurations.

Yet there are special points like (0;0;0;0;0;1)and(0;1;0;0;0;0)where the dimension of Mrespec-
tively the ranks of gab,!abandabare locally reduced as shown in table 21. These ﬁndings are not
surprising, especially (0;1;0;0;0;0)should be compared to (0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0)for the squashed fuzzy

4.4.2 A Global View
As the completely squashed fuzzy CP2(that has ﬁrst been discussed in [7]) is in some sense the limit
of the squashed fuzzy CP2for7!0, we expect to ﬁnd a related behaviour. This has already been
manifested in the tables 20 and 21, comparing them to the tables 15 and 16 for = 0.
Looking at ﬁgure 42, which is constructed analogously71to the ﬁgures 37 and 38 for the squashed
fuzzy CP2, this relationship is perfectly visible.
71Here, the directions ^e4;^e6have to be replaced by the directions ^e3;^e5as we dropped X3;X8.

the vicinity of 0in the completely squashed fuzzy CP2forn= 5. Top: projective plot of M, bottom:
projective plot of ~Min the directions ^ei;^e3;^e5; left:i= 2, right:i= 1
In ﬁgure 43 we see sliced plots similar to the ones in ﬁgure 43 for the squashed fuzzy CP2that conﬁrm
that the shape is not only caused by the restriction in ~RD.
Figure 43: Plots of the completely squashed fuzzy CP2forn= 5. Left: sliced plot of ~Min the
directions ^e2;^e3;^e5for15000random points; right: ~Min the directions ^e1;^e3;^e5for15000random
points
Now, we take a closer look at the slice of ~Mthrough the plane spanned by ^e1;^e3;^e5. Figure 44 shows
plots of random points from the same plane in ~R3. On the left hand side, the components of the points
are bounded by 1and we recover the shape from ﬁgure 42. Here, we might wonder how the inside
looks like. This question is answered by the plot on the right hand side, where the components of the
points are bounded by 0:01. Now we can see that asymptotically there are three planes that intersect
orthogonally in the origin, preventing ~Mfrom being a well deﬁned manifold, while Mremains a
smooth manifold.
This phenomenon has been well known and was ﬁrst described in [7] and then in [4].

4.4.3 Eﬀective Dimension, Foliations and Integration
For the completely squashed fuzzy CP2the eﬀective dimension can be found to be l= 4forn >1,
continuing the result for the squashed fuzzy CP2.
Intable22weseethemostrelevantquantitiescalculatedforthehybridleafthrough x= (1;2;1;0;0;0)
depending on n. Yet, the completely squashed fuzzy CP2and squashed fuzzy CP2share the same
problems concerning the integration over the leaf and we should not be too trustworthy with the
quantities coming from integration.
Also here, we see that V!depends on n. The quality of the completeness relation and the quantization
of the xais extremely bad already for n= 2, while the compatibility of the diﬀerent Poisson structures
is not very good but acceptable. The Kähler properties hardly depend on n, while we see that the
hybrid subspace is not very well adapted compared to the optimal Kähler subspace.

4.5 The Fuzzy Torus
Our ﬁnal example is the so called fuzzy torus , deﬁned via the two unitary clock and shift matrices U
andVfor a given N > 0. Their exact deﬁnition is given in appendix B.3.
Then, we set
T2
N:= (Re(U);Im(U);Re(V);Im(V)): (149)
In principle, a discussion (that we do not repeat here) completely analogous to our ﬁrst construction
of the fuzzy sphere in section 2.1.2 is possible (where the relation to the ordinary Cliﬀord torus is
manifest), see for example [4]. Still, there are fundamental diﬀerences to the fuzzy sphere, since the
matrices do not come from a semisimple Lie algebra.
904.5.1 First Results and Dimensional Aspects
As usual, we begin by calculating the dimension of Mand the ranks of gab,!abandabdepending
onN.
Table 23 shows the results, where we ﬁnd that Mis one dimensional for N= 2(this can also be
shown analytically [1]) and three dimensional for N > 2, while the ranks follow the usual scheme.
dim(M)rank(g)rank(!)rank()
N= 22 1 0 0
N > 23 3 2 2
Table 23: Overview of the dimensions and ranks in diﬀerent scenarios
Since the Cliﬀord torus T2is two dimensional, this is not exactly what we would expect, but since we
do not deal with coadjoint orbits, it is also not completely surprising that we ﬁnd a drawback.
For the fuzzy torus, there is a better way to plot points in R4than our usual method from section 3.2,
using the generalized stereographic map

that maps the Cliﬀord torus T2to a better known embedding of the topological torus into R3(the
doughnut ) [28].
Inﬁgure45wecanseeprojectiveplotsofCartesiancoordinatelinesandstereographicplotsforrandom

First, we note that we truly ﬁnd ~M=S1forN= 2. So far, we can not easily recognize a torus in the
plots of the Cartesian coordinate lines, but for N= 100the plot partially looks like what we would
expect for a projective plot of T2.
Considering the lower plots, we get conﬁdent that we might ﬁnd ~M!T2asN!1.

This can easily be veriﬁed quantitatively: If we had ~M=T2, we would ﬁnd (x1)2+ (x2)2= 1 =
(x3)2+ (x4)2, so we check this constraint for diﬀerent N.
In table 24 we see the average and the standard deviation of (x1)2+ (x2)2respectively (x3)2+ (x4)2

listed, depending on N.
We can see that the symplectic volume depends on N. Further, the quality of the completeness
relation and the quantization of the xais pretty good. With the same arguments as in section 4.1.7 it
is plausible that equation (67) and (66) hold exactly for N!1. We also see that the correction factor
nX0goes to one in the limit. Similarly, we ﬁnd that the two Poisson structures mutually approach
with increasing N. Finally, also the Kähler properties improve with N.

construction of T2
Nthat in some sense discretizes U(1)U(1), but here we deal with true manifolds
and not with discretizations. The plots of the tilings conﬁrm that already for N= 5the foliation
approximately recovers a torus in M, what is clearly better than what we have seen in ﬁgure 45. For
largerNthe quality improves further.

925 Conclusion
This work implements the framework introduced in [1] on a computer and makes it possible to lo-
cally and globally visualize the so called quantum manifold that is associated to an arbitrary matrix
conﬁguration. Further it shows the necessity to work with foliations of this quantum manifold in
order to maintain stability under perturbations and to produce meaningful results. For these, various
approaches were discussed and compared for diﬀerent examples, making it possible to construct cov-
erings with local coordinates and to integrate over the leaves, allowing for quantitative veriﬁcation.
Also analytical results are featured in this thesis, including the proof that the quantum manifold is
a well deﬁned smooth manifold as well as various perspectives on the Hermitian form haband the
perturbative calculations for the squashed fuzzy sphere.
We have seen in section 2.2.3 that (@a iAa)jxi(and consequently also hab) can be calculated purely
algebraically using the reﬁned equation (49) while equation (52) showed that the Nxare convex in
~RD.
In the sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.5, interwoven with appendix A, we have seen plenty of diﬀerent perspec-
tivesontheHermitianform habandconsequentlythequantummetric gabandthewould-besymplectic
form!ab: While the perspective on !abas the ﬁeld strength of a principal connection respectively as
the pullback of the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form and the quantum metric as the pullback
of the Fubini-Study metric have already been discussed in [1], the perspective as the pullback of a
bundle metric on the bundle TBis new. On the other hand the convexity of the Nxis crucial in the
proof thatMis an immersed submanifold of CPN 1.
The perturbative calculations allowed for a mutual veriﬁcation of themselves and later numerical com-
putations and made it possible to analytically witness the phenomenon called oxidation , making the
use of foliations inevitable.
We have seen four diﬀerent approaches to foliations of Min section 2.4, where the hybrid leaf (coming
in two diﬀerent ﬂavors) showed to be the most robust and easiest method to calculate. Concerning
deformed quantum geometries, it allows one to calculate the eﬀective dimension of Mthat always
agreed with the unperturbed case. It is further the basis for many numerical results.
In section 3 algorithms for numerical computations are described. This includes methods for the
calculation and analyzation of the quasi-coherent states, the quantum metric gaband the would-be
symplectic form !abas well as the visualization of Mand ~M.
Further the integration of curves in the leaves and the construction of local coordinates and cover-
ings with coordinates for a given leaf – ﬁnally allowing numerical integration over the latter – were
implemented.
The explicit results in section 4 show that the framework introduced in [1], reﬁned with foliations
ofM, generates a meaningful semiclassical limit for matrix conﬁgurations that are not too far away
from well known examples, where the perturbations may still be signiﬁcant. Further, we have seen
visually and quantitatively how robust these methods are against such perturbations.
For the squashed fuzzy sphere we could observe the oxidation of Mboth graphically and via the
computation of various ranks. We further saw how well the numerical methods work, especially to
generate a covering with coordinates of the leaf L, which turned out to be (at least approximately) well
deﬁned. The veriﬁcation of the completeness relation and similar properties showed a good quality
for small and medium perturbations with a tendency to reach the quality of the round case in the
largeNlimit.
93For the (with random matrices) perturbed fuzzy sphere we got comparable results, accompanied by
intuitive pictures that come with a nice interpretation via gauge ﬁelds. However, some questions
remain concerning the large Nlimit.
The (completely) squashed fuzzy CP2showed to behave very similar in principle, while the computa-
tional demand increased signiﬁcantly. The visual results are well comparable to the results in [3, 4].
Due to the lacking computational power, the quantitative results that depend on the integration over
the leaf showed to be of too bad numerical quality in order to be of great signiﬁcance.
The fuzzy torus turned out to be an example where the methods apply extraordinarily well. Due to
the foliations, we could recognize the torus in Lalready for N= 5. Without foliations this was only
possible in the large Nlimit.
In general, the results suggest that the completeness relation (67), the recovery of the matrix con-
ﬁgurationXaas the quantization of the xa(66) and the compatibility of the two diﬀerent Poisson
structures (68) hold approximately for perturbed quantum spaces, with a tendency to improve for
largeN. Further, the results suggest that equation (68) reformulates results from [1] (discussed in
section 2.2.7), such that they also hold away from local minima of .
This supports the assumption that the quantization map (64) fulﬁlls the axioms from section 2.1, at
least in the large Nlimit.
Yet, a few open tasks and questions remain.
First, some analytic results on the integrability of the distributions that deﬁne the leaves would be
desirable. Further, the suggested method to select a preferred leaf Ldid not prove very successful,
thus the deﬁnition of such a choice remains an open task.
On the other hand, it could be beneﬁcial to look at more examples, including both higher DandN.
For that, clearly, more computational power is needed. Concerning the perturbed fuzzy sphere, it
would be interesting to investigate the consequences when restricting the random matrices to modes
of order smaller or equal O(p
N)as discussed in section 4.2.
Finally, one could also think of a generalization of the framework and the implementation to more
general target spaces, for example Minkowski space.
This thesis reﬁned the construction of a semiclassical limit from [1] and showed that produced results
are meaningful, stable and numerical accessible for arbitrary matrix conﬁgurations.

96A The U(1)Bundle and the Quantum Manifold
In this appendix the details behind the bundle and manifold structure (that come with the quasi-
coherent states), for which there was no room in section 2.2, are discussed.
As the smooth dependence of the eigensystem of the Hamiltonian Hxon the point xis essential, an
important result on the analytic parameter dependence of the eigensystem is reviewed in section A.1.
Based on that, in section A.2 the naturally emerging U(1)bundleBtogether with its natural principal
connection is discussed, followed by an alternative view on the quantum metric and the would-be
symplectic form in section A.3.
Finally, in section A.4 it is shown that Mis a smooth manifold.
A.1 Analytic Parameter Dependence of the Eigensystem
In the following, we need an important result on the analyticity of the eigensystem that follows from
[29], noting that we only consider neighborhoods where the eigenvalue of interest is strictly separated
from the others.
Theorem: LetA:URn!Herm(H)be an analytic function from an open subset UofRninto the
set of hermitian operators on a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space H. Letx2Uandxbe an eigenvalue
ofA(x)of multiplicity 1with corresponding eigenvector vx.
Then, there exists an open neighborhood VUofxand analytic functions :V!Randv:
V!Hsuch that(x) =x,v(x) =vxwith(y)being an eigenvalue of A(y)of multiplicity 1with
corresponding eigenvector v(y)8y2V.
In our case, we deal with the analytic72Hamiltonian H:RD!Herm(H)introduced in equation (33),
while we restrict ourselves to the subset ~RD:=fx2RDjdim(Ex) = 1g(whereExis deﬁned as the
eigenspace of Hxcorresponding to the lowest eigenvalue 1;x). The theorem then implies ﬁrst that
~RDis open in RDand second that locally around x(in the notation from section 2.2.1) we can write73
1;x=(y)andj1;yi=jyisfor smooth andjis.
72The analyticity is obvious as the Hamiltonian is a polynomial in x.
73At ﬁrst, it is not clear if the function v(x)in the theorem is normalized, but, as normalizing a vector is a smooth
operation, we can always choose a smooth ~v(x).
97A.2 The U(1)Bundle
We start by prooﬁng that any matrix conﬁguration with ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space Hand
nonempty ~RDdeﬁnes a unique U(1)bundle.
Proposition: For a matrix conﬁguration as deﬁned in section 2.2 (with Nﬁnite), there exists a
unique principal ﬁber bundle p:B! ~RDwith ﬁberU(1), whereB:=f(x;j i)2~RDHj j i2
Ex;h j i= 1gandpis the restriction of pr1:~RDH! ~RDtoB.
Proof:In the last section we have noted that ~RDis open and thus a Ddimensional submanifold of
RD. There, we also saw that for any x2~RDexists a neighborhood U~RDand a mapjis:U!H
such thatjyis2Eyandhyjyis s= 1for everyy2U. Then, for eachjisthe mapy7!(y;jyis)exactly
is a candidate for a local smooth section of B.
Consequently, we deﬁne the smooth map :UU(1)!p 1(U)Bvia(y;ei)7!(y;eijyis)
(obviously being bijective) and we declare (U; 1)as a bundle chart for B.
Let now (V;  1)be a chart of the same form coming from another jis0:V!Hwith nonempty
W:=U\V, providing us with the transition function !:= 1 :WU(1)!WU(1).
For eachy2Wwe ﬁndjyis0=hyjyis s0jyiswherehyjyis s0computes the necessary U(1)-phase74,
thus!(y;ei) = (y;hyjyis s0ei)what clearly is a diﬀeomorphism.
By lemma 2.2 in [30], Bis a ﬁber bundle with standard ﬁber U(1)and by the explicit form of the
chart change we constructed a principal bundle atlas, making Binto a principal ﬁber bundle. 
Using the metric structure of the standard ﬁber, we now want to ﬁx a natural connection on the
bundle.
SinceB ~RDH, we get a natural inclusion TB,!T~RDTH=T~RDHH . In terms of local
curves, we get an intuitive description of the tangent bundle of B. Therefore, for any manifold Mwe
introduce the set  x(M)that consists of all smooth curves c: [ ;0]!Mfor some;0>0with
c(0) =x. Then we can write any tangent space of Bas
T(x;j i)B=fd
dt
t=0(c(t);j(t)i)jc2 x(~RD);ji2 j i(H);h(t)j(t)i= 1;j(t)i2Ec(t)g:
Considering the identiﬁcation T~RDTH=T~RDHH, we writed
dt
t=0(c(t);j(t)i)=(x;j i;jvi),
wherex:= (x;d
dt
t=0c(t))2Tx~RDandjvi:=d
dt
t=0j(t)i2H.
A small side remark: Fixing a local section jissuch thatjxis=j i, we ﬁnd the parameteriza-
tionj(t)i=ei(t)jc(t)isfor a smooth function : [ ;0]!R, thusd
dt
t=0(c(t);ei(t)jc(t)is)=
(x;j i;(djxis)(x)+ij i), where:=d
dt
t=0(t). Mapping (;j i;(djxis)(x)+ij i)7!(x;i)
thus locally trivializes TB. This corresponds to the local trivialization of Binduced by any local sec-
tionjis.
Based on this result, we get a simple deﬁnition of a principal connection on B.
Proposition: OnBthere is a natural principal connection, given by H:=f(x;j i;jvi)2TB
T~RDHHjh jvi= 0g. Then the associated connection 1-form is given by (x;j i)(x;j i;jvi) =
 h jvi, while the pullback of to~RDalong a local section jisis given by iA(x) := (ji
s)(x) =
 hxjdjxi, whereAis real.
74This for example follows from the spectral theorem in one dimension.
98Proof:We consider (x;j i)(x;j i;jvi) := h jvi(ifshows to be a principal connection 1-from,
thenHis exactly its kernel and thus a principal connection by theorem 3.3 in [30]).
Obviously, is smooth andC1-linear, thus a 1-from. For every normalized ji2 j i(H)we have
0 =d
dt
t=0(h(t)j(t)i) =h(t)jd
dtj(t)i
t=0+ (h(t)jd
dtj(t)i)
t=0, implying is Lie algebra val-
ued75.
Fori2u(1), consider the fundamental vector ﬁeld i(x;j i) :=d
dt
t=0rexp( it)(x;j i)
=d
dt
t=0(x;exp( it)j i)=(0;j i; ij i), thus(x;j i)(i(x;j i)) =i, meaningis vertical.
Now, ((rg))(x;j i)(x;j i;jvi) =(x;gj i)(x;gj i;gjvi)sincergis linear. Using the U(1)in-
variance of the inner product, we get
((rg))(x;j i)(x;j i;jvi) =(x;j i)(x;j i;jvi) = Ad(g 1)((x;j i)(x;j i;jvi)), while the sec-
ond step is a consequence of the fact that the adjoint representation of any abelian Lie group is trivial.
So we conclude that gamma is U(1)equivariant and thus a principal connection 1-form.
Finally, we consider  iA(x) := (jis)(x)(x) =(x;jxis)(x;Txjisx). The tangent map can
be calculated in terms of curves: Txjisx=d
dt
t=0jc(t)is= (djxis)(x), giving us the result
 iA(x) =(x;jxis)(x;jxis;Txjxisx) =  hxjs(djxis)(x) = (hxjsdjxis)(x). Of course, iAlies
in the Lie algebra too, so Ais real. 
Now we are in possession of a principal U(1)bundle, equipped with a principal connection. On the
other hand,Hhas a natural U(1)action, inducing an associated vector bundle :E:=PU(1)H!
~RD, coming with an induced linear connection on E.
For a local section jisofBonU~RD, we directly get a local trivialization of both PandE. Here,
we can view local sections ofEas smooth functions f:M!H.
Through these trivializations, we can view jisboth as a section of Pas well as of E. Using theorem
3.4 in [30], one ﬁnds the simple description of the induced linear connection:
f;r[f] + (jis)()f=df() iA()f;
whereis a smooth local vector ﬁeld, and indicates the U(1)action.
In Cartesian coordinates, viewing jisas a local section76ofE, this reads
iAa(x) =hxjs@ajxis; Dajxis= (1 jxishxjs)@ajxis= (@a iAa)jxis;
where it is conventional to write Da(what we call gauge covariant derivative ) instead ofr@ain this
context.
Of course, we can look at the curvature 2-form 
 =d+[;] =d(sinceU(1)is abelian), descending
to the 2-form 2!:= ijis
 =dA. We call!ﬁeld strength andAgauge ﬁeld .
As a ﬁnal remark, we observe that Einherits a complex valued bundle metric from the inner product
onHas the latter is invariant under U(1).
75The Lie group of U(1)is given by u(1)=iR.
76In the above, this exactly means f=jis.
99A.3 The Quantum Metric and the Would-Be Symplectic Form
As we have seen in the last section, we can equip Ewith a natural U(1)invariant bundle metric. Using
a similar construction, we can equip TBwith a horizontal complex valued metric ~h:TBBTB!
C1
C(TB),((x;j i;jvi);(0
x;j 0i;jv0i))7!hvHjv0Hi, where (x;j i;jvHi)forjvHi:= (1 j ih j)jvi
is the projection on the horizontal subbundle77.
Then, the pullback along a local section jisimmediately gives
h(;) := (jis~h)(;) = (Djis)yDjisas(jis)H= (djis())H= (djis jishjsdjis)() =
(djis iAjis)() =Djis. InCartesiancoordinatesthisreads hab(x) = ((@a iAa)jxi)y(@b iAb)jxi.
By construction it is clear that his independent of the chosen section.
Since ~his hermitian, the same holds for hand we may decompose it into its real and imaginary part
h=g+i!, wheregis symmetric and !is antisymmetric. Carrying this out, one immediately veriﬁes
that the so deﬁned !coincides with the ﬁeld strength from the last section
hab=@ahxj@bjxi AaAb;
gab=1
2(@ahxj@bjxi+@bhxj@ajxi 2AaAb);
!ab=1
2i(@ahxj@bjxi @bhxj@ajxi) =1
2(@aAb @bAa) = (1
2dA)ab:
This directly implies that !is closed (and if further nondegenerate: symplectic). However, from this
construction we can not determine the rank of neither gnor!.
A.4 The Quantum Manifold
Recall the deﬁnition of k,Mandqfrom section 2.2.5. By construction we deal with a smooth
surjectionq:^RD!M CPN 1of constant rank k.
Therefore, we recall the constant rank theorem:
Theorem: “SupposeMandNare smooth manifolds of dimensions mandn, respectively,
andF:M!Nis a smooth map with constant rank r. For eachp2Mthere exist smooth
charts (U;)forMcentered at pand(V; )forNcentered at F(p)such thatF(U)V,
in whichFhas a coordinate representation [^F= F 1:(U)! (V)]of the form
^F(x1;:::;xr;xr+1;:::;xm) = (x1;:::;xr;0;:::; 0).”– theorem 4.12 in [28].
For anyx2^RDthe theorem guarantees the existence of corresponding charts (U;)for^RDand(V; )
forM. We will use these to deﬁne a chart for M, but before we can do so we need two technical
lemmas.
In the ﬁrst lemma we construct a prototypical chart (U; 1)aroundq(x)2M, using the constant
rank theorem.
Lemma 1: Considerq:^RD!M CPN 1as in section 2.2.5. Then for each x2^RDthere exists
an open subset URkand a subsetU M around 0respectively q(x)and a smooth bijection
:U!Ubetween them.
77That this gives the horizontal projection can be seen in various ways. The easiest is to insert what we already know
in the deﬁnition H(~p) =~p (p)(~p)(p)for~p2TpB, while noting that Hacts trivially on the ﬁrst component.
100Proof: We consider the charts and the map q0:= q 1:(U)! (V), coming from the
constant rank theorem.
Now, we deﬁne the sets U0:=(U),U:=q(U)and the smooth map 0:=q 1:U0!U, thus0
is bijective by construction.
Further,0=  1q0and since is a diﬀeomorphism, 0still has constant rank kand depends only
on the ﬁrst kcoordinates 1;:::;kinU0RD.
We deﬁne78U:=U0\Rkand :=0jU.
By shrinking79Uwe can make surjective. Since has full rank it is an immersion, thus locally
injective and we can shrink Uonce again in order to make bijective. 
A little comment on the notation may be helpful. All quantities marked with a commaare related to
the space RDthat is the target of the coordinates , while the quantities marked with a barlive on
theRk=Rkf0gRD.
Now we note that for all y2Uthe restriction of  1toN0
y:= (fygRD k)\U0is a diﬀeomorphism
fromN0
ytoN 1(y;0)\U.
To see this we note that  1(N0
y)lies withinN 1(y;0)\Uas0is constant here. Further q0is injective
onU0\Rk, thus only points in N0
yare mapped toN 1(y;0)\U.
For anyz2^RDthis immediately implies dim(TzNz) =D k, while obviously TzNzket(Tzq).
Thus,TzNz= ket(Tzq)what in turn implies that the whole Nzlies within ^RD.
This leads us to the following lemma that shows that NW:=[x2WNxis open in ^RDifWis.NWis
calledsaturation ofWunder the equivalence relation from section 2.2.5.
Lemma 2: LetW^RD. IfWis open in ^RD, then alsoNWis open in ^RD.
Proof:Recall the setup from the proof of lemma 1. Since NW[NX=NW[X, it suﬃces to show
the claim for WU. We deﬁne W0:=(W)U0what is clearly open. By the above we ﬁnd
NW\U= 1((W0+f0gRD k)\U0). Sinceis a diﬀeomorphism, this shows that NW\Uis
open.
Consider now a point y2NW. By construction there is a y02Wsuch thaty2Ny0. SinceNy0is
convex, it contains the straight line segment that joins ywithy0.
Then, we can pick orderedpointsyfor= 0;:::;non this line segment with y0=y0andyn=y
such that the corresponding U(which we get in the proof of lemma 1 for the point y) cover the
line segment (w.l.o.g. we have U\U=;ifj j>1). For > 0we inductively deﬁne
W:=NW 1\U 1\UNWwithW0:=W.
Repeating the above discussion, all Ware open. By construction, all WcontainNy0\U 1\U
and are thus nonempty. So ﬁnally, y2NWn\UnNW.
This means that every point y2NWhas an open neighborhood in NW.
This result is crucial and allows us to prove that Mis a smooth manifold.
Proposition:Mas deﬁned in section 2.2.5 is a smooth manifold of dimension k.
78Here, we implicitly identiﬁed Rk=Rkf0gRDand similarly for RD k.
79Especially such that URD kcontainsU0.
101Proof:By lemma 1 we can cover Mwith prototypical charts (U; 1
)aroundq(x)for appropriate
pointsx, deﬁning a prototypical atlas .
Consider now two charts with indices ;such thatU:=U\U6=;. That the corresponding chart
changes are smooth is obvious, but it remains to show that the charts consistently deﬁne a topology
onM. Then by lemma 1.35 in [28] Mis a smooth manifold of dimension k.
Especially, this means that we have to show that (w.l.o.g.) U:= 1
(U)is open in Rk.
Since UU, we only have to show that Uis open in the latter. This is equivalent to the
statement that there is no sequence UnUthat converges against a point in U.
Assume to the contrary that such a sequence (ya)exists. Since is a diﬀeomorphism, this deﬁnes the
convergent sequence (xa) := ( 1
(ya))in^RDwith lima!1xa=:x0
. By assumption, q(x0
)2U,
thus, there is an x0
2Uwithq(x0
) =q(x0
). But then by deﬁnition, x0
2Nx0and consequently
x0
2NU. Since the latter is open by lemma 2, this implies that some xailie withinNU. But for
these, we ﬁnd q(xai)2Uand consequently yai2Uwhat contradicts the assumption. 
As the rank of qequalskthis shows that the inclusion M,!CPN 1is an immersion and thus Mis
an immersed submanifold of the latter.
Further, the topology that we deﬁned on Mvia the atlas is exactly the topology that we get when
declaring the bijection q:^RD=!Mfrom section 2.2.5 as a homeomorphism when considering the
quotient topology on ^RD=. In fact, lemma 2 exactly shows that q:^RD!Mis a quotient map for
this topology.
If we identify CPN 1=S2N 1=U(1), whereS2N 1=fj i2CNjh j i= 1g, we also get a natural
identiﬁcation of the tangent spaces80TU(1)j iCPN 1=fjvi2CNjh jvi= 0g.
On the other hand, complex projective space can be viewed as the natural ﬁber bundle p:CNnf0g!
CPN 1, where in our identiﬁcation the bundle projection pmapsj itoU(1)j i=p
h j i, coming
with the tangent map Tj ip= (1 j ih j).
Then, wegetaninducedhermitianform ^honTCPN 1via^h(U(1)j i)(jvi;jwi) =hvjwi. Byconstruc-
tion, its real part is proportional to the Fubini-Study metric and its imaginary part to the canonical
symplectic form on CPN 1, the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form [24].
Since the inclusion j:M,!CPN 1is a smooth immersion, we can pull back ^htoMwhat we
callhM=gM+i!M, providing us with a metric and an (in general degenerate but closed) would-
be symplectic form. Especially, we ﬁnd hab(x) := (qhM)(x)(@a;@b) =hM(q(x))(Txq@a;Txq@b) =
hM(q(x))(Tjxisp@ajxis;Tjxisp@bjxis) =hM(q(x))(Dajxis;Dbjxis) =^h(U(1)jxis)(Dajxis;Dbjxis)
= (Dajxis)yDbjxis, where we described q=pjisvia a local section and used Dajxis= (1 
jxishxjs)@ajxis=Tjxisp@ajxis.
But this means that the pullback of hMalongqagrees with the habwe have deﬁned earlier, while the
same holds for gMand!M.
Since we now know that Mis a manifold, locally we can get even simpler coordinates. For each point
x0in^RD, we can ﬁnd kdistinct indices such that@isnotin the kernel of Txq. But then we can
ﬁnd an open neighbourhood in Rkwhere the map ()7!x0+P
^eis bijective, providing us
with a chart forM. The pullbacks of gMand!Mare then simply given by the submatrices of (gab)
and(!ab)corresponding to the selected indices.
Since we know that gagrees up to a scale with the pullback of the Fubini-Study metric, (g)cannot
be degenerate, while we have no result for (!).
80The tangent space of S2N 1atj iis given by all vectors jvi2CNthat satisfy the constraint Re(h jvi) = 0. In the
quotient this means that the constraint has to be satisﬁed for all U(1)j i, meaningh jvi= 0.
102B The Relevant Representations
In this appendix we want to discuss the construction of the su(2)and su(3)Lie algebra generators in
a given irreducible representation as well as the clock and shift matrices, where SU(n)is then2 1
dimensional Lie group of unit determinant unitary matrices acting on Cnand su(n)is the associated
Lie algebra consisting of the traceless Hermitian matrices acting on Cn.
B.1 The Representations of su(2)
LetJ1;J2;J3be an orthonormal basis of the Lie algebra su(2)with respect to the Killing form. Then
we know their commutation relations
[Ja;Jb] =iabcJc: (151)
SU(2)has exactly one nontrivial irreducible representations of dimension Nfor everyN > 1, where
we have the quadratic Casimir
J2:=X
aJaJa=N2 1
41:=j(j+ 1)1=:C2
N1: (152)
We can then isometrically identify the representation with CN, especially such that J3acts diagonally
on the standard basis.
We can even do more: It turns out that J3has the eigenvalues  j; j+ 1;:::;j 1;jand we can
implement J3as the diagonal matrix diag( j; j+ 1;:::;j 1;j), while we introduce the notation
jki:= ^ek+(j+1). So it remains to ﬁnd J1andJ2explicitly. For that reason, we deﬁne J:=J1J2,
implying the commutation relations
[J3;J] =J: (153)
Thus, theJraise respectively lower the eigenvalues of J3by1in the eigenbasis. But this means
nothing more than Jjki/jk+ 1i, while the proportionality factors turn out to be
Jjki=p
j(j+ 1) k(k1)jk1i: (154)
This means that J+acts as the matrix with the only non zero components being
(p
j(j+ 1) k(k+ 1))fork= j;:::;j 1on the ﬁrst diagonal below the main diagonal and
J with (p
j(j+ 1) k(k 1))fork= j+ 1;:::jon the ﬁrst diagonal above the main diagonal.
Finally, we recover the matrices J1=1
2(J++J )andJ2=1
2i(J+ J )[31].
We also note that
j=N 1
2(155)
respectively
N= 2j+ 1 (156)
and write for the explicit matrices in a chosen representation Ja
Nfora= 1;2;3.
103B.2 The Representations of su(3)
ForSU(3)we pick eight matrices Tathat form an orthonormal basis of the Lie algebra su(3), again
with respect to the Killing form. These matrices satisfy the commutation relations
[Ta;Tb] =ifabcTc(157)
for well known coeﬃcients fabcthat are completely antisymmetric.
Here, we have the two Cartan generators T3andT8that mutually commute.
Then for each pair (p;q)wherep;q0, there is a unique irreducible representation of dimension
N=1
2(p+ 1)(q+ 1)(p+q+ 2), coming with the quadratic Casimir
X
aTaTa=1
3 
p2+q2+ 3p+ 3q+pq
1: (158)
Further, the eigenvalues of T3andT8are well known and the representation can be identiﬁed with
CN[31]. The remaining task is to explicitly calculate the components of the matrices as which the
Taact in an appropriate basis.
An algorithm for that together with an actual implementation for Mathematica can be found in [25].
We will only need the special case where (p;q) = (n;0). Here the formulae reduce to
N=1
2(n+ 1)(n+ 2) (159)
and
X
aTaTa=1
3(n2+ 3n)1:=C2
n1 (160)
and we write Ta
nfor the explicit matrices.
B.3 The Clock and Shift Matrices
Now we come to the clock and shift matrices. For a given N > 1we deﬁne
q:= exp(2i1
N); (161)
and the two matrices
Uij=i;j+1andVij=ijqi 1(162)
acting on CN.
These objects satisfy the relations
qN= 1; UN=1=VNrespectively UV=qVU: (163)
This construction is called clock and shift algebra [4].
104C The Perturbative Approach for the Squashed Fuzzy Sphere
In this appendix the perturbative approach to the calculation of the quasi-coherent states of the
squashed fuzzy sphere for arbitrary Nis discussed.
We begin by replacing the squashing parameter with 1 for a small >0, leading to the matrix
conﬁguration (X1;X2;(1 )X3), where the Xa=1
CNJaare the matrices81introduced in section
2.3.2 respectively appendix B.1.
This leads to the Hamiltonian
H(x) =H0(x) +V(x);forV(x) := 2
2 
X32+x3X3; (164)
where
H0(x) =1
2X
a(Xa xa1)2(165)
is the Hamiltonian of the round fuzzy sphere, while the diﬀerent notation with respect to section 2.2
has only been adapted for better readability. Here, we might drop the contribution to V(x)directly.
Ourtaskistocalculatetheeigensystemof H(x), especially H(x)jk;xi=k;xjk;xifor82k= j;:::;j.
Thus, we expand the eigenvectors and eigenvalues in powers of , meaningjk;xi=jk;x;0i+jk;x;1i+
O(2)andk;x=k;x;0+k;x;1+O(2), whereH0(x)jk;x;0i=k;x;0jk;x;0i.
From perturbation theory we know that we ﬁnd
k;x;1=hk;x;0jV(x)jk;x;0iandjk;x;1i=X
l6=khl;x;0jV(x)jk;x;0i

(see for example [32]), thus we start with the calculation of the unperturbed eigensystem k;x;0and
jk;x;0i.
C.1 The Unperturbed Eigensystem
Any giveny6= 0we can write as ya=rnawherer=jyj2R+
0andn=y=r2S2R3. Then the
su(2)commutation relations imply ad(rnaJa)(Jb) =rna[Ja;Jb] =irnaabcJc= (ad(rna))bcJc, thus
the matrix form in the basis Jais
ad(rnaJa) =ir0

One directly veriﬁes that (Vn)3= Vn.
81In section 2.3.3 we wrote Xafor them, but here it is advantageous to stick to the notation Xa.
82Note that also here the notation is diﬀerent from section 2.2. The labeling kof the eigensystem is not such that
k;xk0;xfork<k0but rather corresponds to the eigenvalues of J3jki=kjki.
105This can be used to calculate

This is very parallel to the derivation of the Rodrigues rotation formula (see for example [33]). Once
again, one directly veriﬁes that for an (ma)2S2

mJb=maJa(special care has to be taken at the

We write this as UmJ3Uy
m=maJaforUm:=eirmnb
mJb. In the eigensystem of J3(deﬁned as
J3jki=kjkifork= j;:::;j) we thus ﬁnd
H0(x)Umjki=1

We further conclude that we ﬁnd the lowest eigenvalue for k=jand thus(x) =j;xandjxi=jj;xi.
C.2 The First Correction
The next step is to calculate the ﬁrst correction to the eigensystem, meaning k;x;1andjk;x;1i.
For(na)2R3we deﬁnen:=1
2(n1in2). Recalling the results from section B.1, this allows us to
rewrite

m3:=m3(this follows directly from Um=Uy

impliesm= m.

C.3 The Derivatives of the Unperturbed Eigenstates
Now, our aim is to calculate@
@xajk;xiand therefore especially@
@xajk;x;0i= (@

we need the derivative of the exponential map.
For the latter exists the explicit formula

dteX(t)=eX(t)1X
k=0( 1)k
(k+ 1)!(ad(X(t)))kdX(t)
dt=:eX(t)1 e ad(X(t))
ad(X(t))dX(t)
dt;(178)
where the only assumption is that X(t)is a smooth curve in the Lie algebra [34]. Therefore,

Form
Our ﬁnal step is the calculation of hab,gaband!abas deﬁned in equation (41). Accordingly, we
expandhab=h0;ab+h0
ab(and similarly for the others).
In the round case (= 0)we havehab=h0;ab= (@a+iAa)hj;x;0j(@b iAb)jj;x;0iwhere (@a 
iAa)jj;x;0i= (1 jj;x;0ihj;x;0j)@ajj;x;0i=V+
