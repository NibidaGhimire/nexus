Abstract
We investigate the Shannon entropy of the total system and its subsystems, as well as the
subsystemShannonmutualinformation, inquasiparticleexcitedstatesoffreebosonicandfermionic
chains and the ferromagnetic phase of the spin-1/2 XXX chain. For single-particle and double-
particle states, we derive various analytical formulas for free bosonic and fermionic chains in the
scaling limit. These formulas are also applicable to certain magnon excited states in the XXX chain
in the scaling limit. We also calculate numerically the Shannon entropy and mutual information for
triple-particle and quadruple-particle states in bosonic, fermionic, and XXX chains. We discover
that Shannon entropy, unlike entanglement entropy, typically does not separate for quasiparticles
with large momentum differences. Moreover, in the limit of large momentum difference, we obtain
universal quantum bosonic and fermionic results that are generally distinct and cannot be explained
by a semiclassical picture.

1 Introduction
Quasiparticles are interesting collective excitations in integrable many-body systems that often provide
simple intuitive explanations for complex phenomena [1]. One such example is the entanglement
entropy in quasiparticle states of integrable quantum spin chains, which displays intriguing universal
features in the scaling limit [2–17]. It was found that under certain limits, the entanglement entropy in
quasiparticle states displays universal behaviors that can be explained by a semiclassical quasiparticle
picture [5,6]. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether there exists a similar semiclassical
picture for other quantities, such as the total system Shannon entropy, subsystem Shannon entropy,
3and subsystem Shannon mutual information, in excited states of quasiparticles, akin to those observed
for entanglement entropy.
In a state that is pure, the quantum correlation between a subsystem and its complement could
be described by various entanglement measures, including the entanglement entropy, which refers to
the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix. Depending on the particular quantum state
of a given many-body system, the entanglement entropy exhibits various behaviors in the scaling
limit [18–22]. In this paper, we restrict our analysis to the bipartite case, where the entire system
is divided intoa subsystem Aand its complement ¯A. A quasiparticle state could be represented
by the momenta Kof the excited quasiparticles, denoted as |K⟩. The reduced density matrix of
subsystem Acan be denoted as ρA=tr¯A|K⟩⟨K|, and the entanglement entropy can be calculated as
SA,K=−trA(ρAlogρA). It has been discovered that under the large energy condition
max
k∈K1
εk≪min(ℓ, L−ℓ), (1.1)
where εkis energy of the elementary excitation of one quasiparticle with momentum k, and the large
momentum difference condition
|k−k′| ≫1,∀k∈K,∀k′∈K′, (1.2)
the entanglement entropy difference is given by [13]
SA,K∪K′−SA,K′=−trA(˜ρA,Klog ˜ρA,K), (1.3)
where ˜ρA,Kis an effective low-rank reduced density matrix. In other words, under the conditions (1.1)
and (1.2), the spin chain with modes K′acts like a background, and contributions from the modes K
to the entanglement entropy decouple from the background. Analytical formulas of the entanglement
entropy difference in free bosonic and fermionic chains were obtained in [10,11,13], and these formulas
and their proper combinations also apply to models with interactions such as spin-1/2 XXX chain and
XXZ chain under certain conditions [13]. Furthermore, under the extra large momentum difference
condition [10,11]
|k1−k2| ≫1,∀k1, k2∈K, k 1̸=k2, (1.4)
the effective reduced density matrix ˜ρA,Khas a simple semiclassical quasiparticle picture and the
entanglement entropy difference (1.3) becomes the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution
of the semiclassical quasiparticles [5,6]. It was found recently that similar universal properties and
semiclassical quasiparticle picture also apply to the subsystem distance in quasiparticle excited states
of various quantum spin chains [9,12,23].
In quantum mechanics, one can express the state of a quantum system in a pure state |ψ⟩in any
orthonormal basis {|i⟩}with⟨i|j⟩=δijas
|ψ⟩=X
ici|i⟩, (1.5)
wherethenormalizationofthestate ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1impliesthat {pi=|ci|2}formsawell-definedprobability
distribution, i.e., pi≥0andP
ipi= 1. A quantum system in a mixed state is characterized by a
4density matrix ρ, which is positive semi-definite and satisfies tr ρ= 1. One can write the density matrix
in the orthonormal basis {|i⟩}as
ρ=X
i,jρij|i⟩⟨j|, (1.6)
and there is a well-defined probability distribution {pi=ρii}. The Shannon entropy [24,25]
H=−X
ipilogpi, (1.7)
can be calculated for any arbitrary probability distribution {pi}, which measures the uncertainty or
randomness of the probability distribution. In the case of a quantum system in a pure or mixed state,
the Shannon entropy depends on the chosen basis. In quantum spin chains, the direct product of
the local basis at each individual site forms a natural basis. In the local basis, the Shannon entropy
characterizes a type of interesting correlation between different parts of the quantum system. The
Shannon entropy in the local basis of various quantum spin chains has been intensively studied for
both the total system [26–32] and a subsystem [33–42]. The probabilities of finding different states
in this basis are called formation probabilities [40]. These probabilities, especially the emptiness
formation probability, have been the subject of extensive research [28,34,40,43–55]. The Shannon
entropy, which is dependent on the choice of basis, is more experimentally accessible than the basis-
independent entanglement entropy. Measuring entanglement entropy in a general quantum state often
necessitates the complex process of quantum state tomography [56], which can be challenging. In
contrast, determining the Shannon entropy involves performing measurements in a chosen basis on
multiple copies of the quantum state to obtain the probability distribution of outcomes, which can
then be used to calculate the Shannon entropy.
In this paper, we examine the Shannon entropy of both the entire system and a connected subsys-
tem in states of quasiparticle excitations of free bosonic and fermionic chains and the spin-1/2 XXX
chain. We focus on translation invariant states, ensuring that the subsystem Shannon entropy remains
independent of its position within the entire system and solely dependent on the subsystem size. We
not only consider the single-particle and double-particle states, which facilitate analytical calculations,
but also the states with more particles, for which we calculate the Shannon entropy using numerical
methods. The results are then compared across diverse quantum spin chains and also with classical
results. As depicted in Figure 1, we consider a connected subsystem A= [1, ℓ]with ℓneighboring
sites on a circular chain consisting of Lsites. Only translation-invariant states in quantum spin chains
and translation-invariant configurations in classical chains are taken into account. We compute the
Shannon entropy of the entire system H(L)and the subsystem Shannon entropy H(ℓ). Additionally,
we evaluate the subsystem Shannon mutual information,
M(ℓ) =H(ℓ) +H(L−ℓ)−H(L), (1.8)
which is a measure of the correlation between the subsystem Aand its complement B. Our focus is
on understanding the behaviours in the total system Shannon entropy H(L), the subsystem Shannon
entropy H(ℓ), and the subsystem mutual information I(ℓ)as we approach the scaling limit L→+∞,

BFigure 1: The spin chain consists of Lsites arranged in a circle. We consider a connected subsystem
Awith ℓadjacent sites, defined as A= [1, ℓ], and its complement B= [ℓ+ 1, L].
ℓ→+∞while maintaining a constant ratio x=ℓ/L. As there is the semiclassical picture for the
entanglement entropy only in the large momentum difference limit [10,11], we also take such a limit
for the local basis Shannon entropy and see if there is a similar semiclassical picture.
In this paper, we present analytical formulas for the total and subsystem Shannon entropy and
mutual information in single- and double-quasiparticle excited states of free bosonic and fermionic
chains, as well as in single- and double-magnon excited states of the ferromagnetic phase of the spin-
1/2 XXX chain. We also calculated numerically the Shannon entropy and mutual information in
triple-particle and quadruple-particle states in the bosonic, fermionic and XXX chain. In the scaling
limit where Landℓapproach infinity with a fixed ratio between subsystem size and total system size
x=ℓ/L, both the total system Shannon entropy and subsystem Shannon entropy follow a universal
logarithmic law, while the subsystem mutual information is a finite function of the ratio x. The results
obtained for free bosonic and fermionic chains can also be applied to the XXX chain under certain
circumstances. We compare our results with those of classical particles. In a single-particle state, the
results are trivial and universal. In a general multi-particle state with large momentum differences, we
find distinct universal bosonic and fermionic formulas that cannot be reproduced semiclassically. In
the scaling limit, the contributions from different classical particles decouple, whereas this is not the
case for quantum quasiparticles, even in the large momentum difference limit.
The rest of this paper is organized in the following way. In sections 2 and 3, we present calcula-
tions of the total system Shannon entropy and subsystem Shannon entropy and mutual information in
quasiparticle excited states in free bosonic and fermionic chains, respectively. In section 4, we consider
magnon excited states in the spin-1/2 XXX chain. In section 5, we evaluate numerically the Shannon
entropy and mutual information in the triple-particle and quadruple-particle states in the bosonic,
fermionic and XXX chains. The paper concludes with discussions in section 6. We collect the calcu-
lation details for free bosoic chain, free fermionic chain, and XXX chain in respectively appendices A,
B and C. In appendix D, we discuss briefly the entanglement entropy and Shannon entropy in the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. In appendix E, we consider the configurations of classical particles.
In appendix F, we calculate the Shannon entropy for the probability distribution of subsystem particle
numbers in free bosonic and fermionic chains. Finally, in appendix G, we study the Shannon entropy
in the local basis of σx
jeigenstates of the XXX chain.
62 Free bosonic chain
In this section, we evaluate the total system and subsystem Shannon entropies and mutual information
for the free bosonic chain in the single-particle state |k⟩and the double-particle states |k2⟩and|k1k2⟩.
The quasiparticle states analyzed in this paper, within the context of free models, can be derived by
considering the limit of infinite energy gap from the eigenstates of nearest-neighbor interacting models.
In essence, free models can be regarded as particular instances of interacting models. The conclusions
presented in this section, particularly the absence of semiclassical representations for the local basis
Shannon entropy and mutual information, and the inability to isolate contributions from quasiparticles
with large momentum difference, are valid for both the free bosonic chain discussed and the subsequent
free fermionic chain. These findings also extend to their corresponding nearest-neighbor interacting
models.
The construction of the quasiparticle states and the corresponding local configuration probabilities
are shown in appendix A.
2.1 Single-particle state |k⟩
In the state |k⟩with a single quasiparticle with momentum k, we get the Shannon entropy of the total
system

k(L) = log L, (2.1)

and the subsystem Shannon mutual information
Mbos
k(ℓ) =−xlogx−(1−x) log(1 −x). (2.3)
The results for the single-particle state |k⟩are the same with the results for the configuration of
one classical particle (E.19), (E.20) and (E.21).
2.2 Double-particle state |k2⟩
We consider the state |k2⟩with the mode of momentum kbeing excited twice. In the scaling limit, we
get the Shannon entropy
Hbos
k2(L) = 2 log L−log 2. (2.4)
the subsystem Shannon entropy
Hbos
k2(ℓ) = 2 xlogL−x(2−x) log 2 −2(1−x) log(1 −x), (2.5)
and mutual information
Mbos
k2(ℓ) =−x2logx2−2x(1−x) log[2 x(1−x)]−(1−x)2log(1−x)2. (2.6)
7The results for the double-particle state |k2⟩are the same as the results for the configuration of
two identical classical particles (E.22), (E.23), and (E.24). It is easy to check that the results in the
general r-particle state |kr⟩=1√
r!(b†
k)r|G⟩are the same as the results for the configuration of ridentical
classical particles (E.28), (E.29), and (E.30). We skip the details of the calculation in this paper.

For|k12| ≪Lin the limit L→+∞, the Shannon entropy becomes
Hbos
k1k2(L) =Huniv
k1k2(L) = 2 log L−1, (2.8)
which does not depend on the actual values of the momenta k1, k2. As we will see in the subsequent
section, the formula (2.8) also applies to the free fermionic chain under the condition |k12| ≪L. So
we also call it a universal result.
When |k12|is proportional to Lin the scaling limit L→+∞, the Shannon entropy may take
exceptional values for exceptional values of |k12|. For|k12|=mL

For a prime integer L, there is no |k12|=mL

is valid for all k12for a large prime integer L. Interestingly, in further n→+∞limit, the exceptional
formula (2.9) approaches the universal formula (2.8).
We have obtained three formulas for the total system Shannon entropy, i.e. the exact formula (2.7)
writtenintermsofasummationwhichisvalidforgeneral Landk12, theformula(2.8), i.e.theuniversal

which is not the same as either the result for two identical classical particles Hcl
12(ℓ)(E.23) or the result
for two distinguishable classical particles Hcl

Note that the x→1limit of (2.14) is just (2.9) as it should be. Also, the n→+∞limit of the

In summary, we have obtained four formulas for the subsystem Shannon entropy, i.e. the exact
formula (2.11) which is valid for general L,ℓ, and k12, the formula (2.12) which is valid for |k12| ≪L
in the scaling limit L→+∞,ℓ→+∞with fixed x=ℓ/L, the universal formula (2.13) which is valid

Figure 3, where in the left panel we see the large |k12|limit of the bosonic result (2.12), which gives the

which also gives the universal result (2.13).

3 Free fermionic chain
This section deals with the single-particle state |k⟩and double-particle state |k1k2⟩in the free fermionic
chain. ThecalculationdetailsarecollectedinappendixB.Thecaseofthefreefermionicchainresembles
that of the free bosonic chain, so we will keep it brief in this section.
3.1 Single-particle state |k⟩
We can use the same calculations and results as for the single particle state |k⟩in the free bosonic
chain in subsection 2.1. We will skip them here.

For|k12| ≪Lin the limit L→+∞, the Shannon entropy becomes
Hfer
k1k2(L) = 2 log L−1, (3.2)
which is the same as the bosonic result Hbos
k1k2(L)and the universal result Huniv
k1k2(L)in (2.8). This is
why we call the expression a universal result.
For the exceptional value |k12|=mL
n≤L

which are generally different from the exceptional bosonic results (2.10). Again, in further large n
limit, the exceptional result approaches the universal result.

4 XXX chain
In this section, we compute the Shannon entropy of the total system and its subsystem and the
subsystem mutual information in single- and double-magnon excited states of the spin-1/2 XXX chain.
The single-magnon state results are identical to those for the single-particle states in free bosonic and
fermionic chains. The double-magnon state is more complex, as it can be either a scattering state or
a bound state. The total system Shannon entropy part in this section has overlaps with [32].
144.1 Single-magnon state
In the single-magnon state |I⟩total system Shannon entropy and the subsystem Shannon entropy and
mutual information are the same as those of one-particle states in the free bosonic and fermionic chains
in, respectively, subsections 2.1 and 3.1 and the configurations of one soft-core and hard-core classical
particles in, respectively, subsections E.1.1 and E.2.1. We will not repeat the calculations here.
4.2 Double-magnon state
The double-magnon state |I1I2⟩and corresponding configuration probabilities in XXX chain are shown
in appendix C.
4.2.1 Case I solution
The total system Shannon entropy HI
00(L)and subsystem Shannon entropy HI
00(ℓ)and mutual in-
formation MI
00(ℓ)in state |00⟩are, respectively, the same as Hhard
12(L)(E.12), Hhard
12(ℓ)(E.13), and
Mhard
12(ℓ)(E.14). We will not repeat the calculations here.
4.2.2 Case II solution
From these probabilities, we obtain for general parameters L,ℓ,I1andI2the total system Shannon
entropy and the subsystem Shannon entropy and mutual information

We show the total system Shannon entropy, subsystem Shannon entropy and mutual information
in the case IIIa double-magnon state |I1I2⟩of the XXX chain, as well as their tightly bound and loosely
bound limits, in Figure 9. We see that in the range I/L∈(0,0.5)the results of the loosely bound limit
apply for relatively small I/L≳0while the results of the tightly bound limit apply for relatively large
I/L≲0.5. For the total system and subsystem Shannon entropies, there is the range 0.1≲I/L≲0.3
in which both the results of the loosely bound limit and the results of the tightly bound limit apply.

L2with fixed win the scaling limit, we get the same results (4.33), (4.34), and
(4.35). In the limit where vapproaches zero, known as the loosely bound limit, we can observe from
equation (C.38) that p1becomes equal to p2andθbecomes zero. This implies that the two magnons
exhibit behavior similar to two bosonic particles with identical momentum, which corresponds to the
scenario analyzed in subsection 2.2. Consequently, this elucidates why the outcomes align with those
obtained for two identical classical particles.
We show the total system Shannon entropy, subsystem Shannon entropy and mutual information
in the case IIIb double-magnon state |I1I2⟩of the XXX chain, as well as their tightly and loosely bound
limits, in Figure 10.
5 States with three and four quasiparticles
To verify the properties discovered for the double-particle states in the bosonic, fermionic, and XXX
chains, in this section we calculate numerically the Shannon entropy and mutual information in states
with three and four quasiparticles.

L(c)Figure 11: In the left and middle panels, we show the total system Shannon entropy in the triple-
particle and quadruple-particle states of the free bosonic and fermionic chains, respectively. We have
setL= 120andki= 1 + ( i−1)δkwith i= 1,2,3,4. In the right panel, we show the difference of total
system Shannon entropy in the XXX chain and the corresponding result in the free bosonic/fermionic
chain. For the state I1= (1,2,3), there is the corresponding bosonic state K1= (1,2,3), and for the
stateI2= (L
2,L
2+ 2,L
2+ 4), there is the corresponding fermionic state K2= (1,2,3).
K1= (1,1 +δk,1 + 2 δk)andδk=δIin the scaling limit. We also consider the triple-magnon state
|I2⟩with Bethe quantum numbers I2= (L
2,L
2+δI,L
2+2δI)andδI= 2,4,6, which corresponds to the
fermionic triple-particle state |K2⟩with K2= (1,1 +δk,1 + 2δk)andδk=δI−1. Note the difference
that in the bosonic chain δk=δIand in the fermionic chain δk=δI−1.
We present numerical results of the total system Shannon entropy in these triple- and quadruple-
particle states in the left and middle panels of Figure 11. For each state, the total system Shannon
entropy approaches a universal value for almost all values of δk, except for some exceptional cases when
δk/Lhas a finite numerator and denominator in the scaling limit. In both the bosonic and fermionic
chains, the universal values for the states |k1k2k3⟩and|k1k2k3k4⟩are different, contrasting with the
double-particle state |k1k2⟩which has a universal quantum value. In the right panel of Figure 11, we
compare the total system Shannon entropy in the XXX chain and the free bosonic/fermionic chain.
We observe that in the scaling limit, the results for certain states in the XXX chain approach the
corresponding values in the free bosonic/fermionic chain.
We show results of the subsystem Shannon entropy and mutual information in, respectively, fig-
ures 12 and 13. With the increase of the momentum difference δk, the subsystem Shannon entropy and
mutual information approach some universal bosonic and fermionic values, as shown in panels (a), (b),
(d) and (e) of figures 12 and panels (a), (b), (d) and (e) of figures 13, but the bosonic and fermionic
values are generally distinct and also different from the results of classical particles, as shown in panels
(c) and (f) of figures 12 and panels (c) and (f) of figures 13. In panels (a) and (b) of figures 12 and
panels (a) and (b) of figures 13, we also show that results of certain states in the XXX chain approach
the corresponding free bosonic/ferminic results.
The main conclusion of the paper is that there does not exist a classical description for the local

Additionally, it has been shown that contributions to the Shannon entropy from quasiparticles with
large momentum differences do not separate.

Figure 13: The subsystem Shannon mutual information in triple-particle states (top panels) and
quadruple-particle states (bottom panels) of the free bosonic and fermionic chains and the XXX chain.
We have used L= 180.
21We denote a general quasiparticle excited state as |K⟩with Kbeing the set of the momenta of the
excited quasiparticles. The results for double-particle states in the previous sections and the results for
triple- and quadruple-particle states in this section support the general form of the subsystem Shannon
entropy in the scaling limit
HK(ℓ) =|K|xlogL+δHK(x), (5.1)
where |K|is the total number of excited quasiparticles and δHK(x)is a function of the ratio x=ℓ/L.
On the right hand side of (5.1), the universal logarithmic divergent part is the same as that in the
classical results (E.30) and (E.32), and this guarantees a finite subsystem Shannon mutual information
in the scaling limit. For double-particle states, we have observed a universal quantum result in the
limit 1≪ |k12| ≪L
δHbos
k1k2(x) =δHfer
k1k2(x), (5.2)
which is, however, generally nottrue for general triple- and quadruple-particle states. In the limit
1≪ |k12| ≪L, there is the Shannon mutual information
Mbos
k1k2(x) =Mfer
k1k2(x), (5.3)
which is also nottrue for general multi-particle states. Generally, in large momentum difference limit,
there exist distinct universal bosonic and fermionic results, which are also different from the classical
results.
6 Conclusion and discussion
In this paper we have presented an analysis of the total system Shannon entropy, subsystem Shannon
entropy, and subsystem Shannon mutual information in quasiparticle excited states of free bosonic and
fermionic chains, as well as the XXX chain. We compared the results across different spin chains and
contrasted them with those of classical particles. Our findings indicate that, like the entanglement
entropy, the formulas for the Shannon entropy in free bosonic and fermionic chains also apply to the
Shannon entropy in the XXX chain, subject to certain limits. Additionally, we found that even when
quasiparticles have large momentum differences, their contributions to the Shannon entropy do not
decouple, unlike the entanglement entropy. In addition, we have discovered distinct universal bosonic
and fermionic formulas for the total system Shannon entropy, subsystem Shannon entropy, and mutual
information in the limit of large momentum differences, which are also distinct from any classical
particle-based results. In other words, we did not observe any semiclassical quasiparticle picture that
could reproduce the results of the Shannon entropy in quantum spin chains.
In Figure 14, we present the different results for the entanglement entropy, subsystem distance,
and the local particle number basis Shannon entropy. For simplicity, we only calculated the Shannon
entropy in free theories for fermionic and bosonic chains in this paper, which are a special case of
the large energy condition. Unlike the entanglement entropy and subsystem distance, the Shannon
entropy contributions from quasiparticles with large momentum differences do not decouple. As a
result, the combined fermionic and bosonic results are generally not applicable to the XXX chain.

However, the fermionic and bosonic results can still be applied separately to the XXX chain within
certain limits. Another notable distinction is that the semiclassical picture holds true for the universal

basis Shannon entropy.
In the main text of the paper, we have calculated the Shannon entropy using a particular basis
of local states. It is essential to note that the definition of the Shannon entropy is dependent on the
chosen basis. If one selects the eigenstates of the density matrix as the basis, the Shannon entropy
will become equivalent to the von Neumann entropy for both pure and mixed quantum states of the
total system or its subsystem. For quantum spin chains, the eigenstates of the subsystem particle
number operator are also a natural basis. In Appendix F, we have studied the Shannon entropy of
the subsystem particle number probability distribution in free bosonic and fermionic chains. We have
found that the semiclassical quasiparticle picture applies in the large momentum difference limit. In
Appendix G, we have calculated the Shannon entropy in the local basis of the σx
jeigenstates in the
XXX chain. The results are significantly different from those obtained using the σz
jbasis. Even in the
single-magnon state, the σx
jbasis Shannon entropy is already nontrivial. In certain limits, there exist
forms of universal results for which no semiclassical quasiparticle picture applies.
We have found Shannon entropy in local bases for which no semiclassical quasiparticle picture ap-
plies. At the same time, there are the entanglement entropy, subsystem distance and Shannon entropy
of the subsystem particle number probability distribution for which the semiclassical quasiparticle pic-
tureappliesinthelargemomentumdifferencelimit. Weanticipatethatthesemiclassicalpictureapplies
23to coarse-grained properties but not to fine-grained properties. In other words, if one scrutinizes the
microscopic details of a quasiparticle excited state, one can distinguish between quasiparticles and real
particles. However, for a measure of certain macroscopic properties, quasiparticles behave similarly to
real particles.
In our analysis, we have focused on models that encompass a single species of quasiparticles. In
appendix D, we provide a concise discussion on the entanglement entropy and Shannon entropy within
the context of the SSH model [57,58], which incorporates two independent sets of fermionic modes.
Our findings indicate that the individual contributions of these distinct fermionic species to both
entanglement entropy and Shannon entropy are independent of each other. It would be of interest
to investigate the behavior of Shannon entropy in alternative models that feature multiple species of
quasiparticles. In this paper we have focused on translation invariant states in periodic chains. It
would be intertwisting to consider states of inhomogeneous models such as open chains.
Experimental realization of excited states in spin chains was demonstrated in trapped atomic ion
systems [59–61]. Recently, a proposal has been put forward to utilize neutral atom arrays to simu-
late fermionic many-body systems [62]. It would be fascinating to measure the Shannon entropy in
quasiparticle excited states of spin chains and compare the experimental outcomes with the results
presented in this paper. Within this context, measuring the Shannon entropy in quasiparticle excited
states of spin chains offers a window into their quantum correlations. The Shannon entropy, as a
quantitative measure of information content or uncertainty in a probability distribution, can provide
insights into the distribution of quantum states in a system and how they evolve under various in-
teractions and perturbations. Comparing the experimental outcomes with the theoretical predictions
presented in this paper (or similar theoretical frameworks) would not only validate the accuracy of the
experimental platform but also shed light on the microscopic mechanisms governing the quasiparticle
dynamics. Furthermore, such experiments could potentially uncover novel quantum phenomena, such
as unconventional quasiparticle statistics or emergent interactions.

A States and probabilities in free bosonic chain
In this appendix, we show calculation details for the free bosonic chain. We mainly show the con-
structions of the single-particle and double-particle excited states and the corresponding probabilities
of subsystem configurations.

|k⟩=1√

In state |k⟩, there are Lpossible local states |j⟩with j∈[1, L], and the corresponding probabilities
are

For the subsystem A, there are ℓ+ 1possible local states and the corresponding probabilities are
listed in Table 1. The probabilities of the subsystem local states in Table 1 could be calculated either
as the diagonal entries of the reduced density matrix in the local basis or as marginal probabilities of
25the probability distribution (A.9) of the whole system. In this paper we will adopt the latter approach.

The low-lying eigenstates are magnon excited states in the ferromagnetic phase and can be obtained
from the coordinate Bethe ansatz [63,64]. One may use the Bethe numbers of the excited magnons
{I1, I2,···, Is}to denote magnon excited states as |I1I2···Is⟩.
The presence of the transverse field in the Hamiltonian (C.1) makes the eigenstates of σz
jto be a
natural local basis at each site for the XXX chain.2There are also local states, such as
|j⟩=|··· ↓ j···⟩, (C.3)
in which only the site jhas downward spin and all other sites have upward spins, and
|j1j2⟩=|··· ↓ j1··· ↓ j2···⟩, (C.4)
in which only the sites j1, j2have downward spins and all other sites have upward spins. For the
subsystem A, there are the subsystem local states |G⟩Ain which all the sites in Ahas upward spins,
|j⟩Ain which only the site jinAhas downward spin, and |j1j2⟩Ain which only the sites j1, j2inA
have downward spins.
2In appendix G, we show the Shannon entropy in the local basis of σx
jeigenstates, and the results are very different
from the those in σz
jbasis.
29C.2 Single-magnon state
The single magnon state takes the form
|I⟩=1√
LLX
j=1e2πijI
L|j⟩, (C.5)
with the Bethe number I= 0,1,···, L−1. The probability distributions are the same as those in the
free bosonic chain in appendix A.2.
C.3 Double-magnon state
We consider the double-magnon state
|I1I2⟩=1√
NX
1≤j1<j2≤LUj1j2|j1j2⟩, (C.6)
with the Bethe numbers I1, I2which are integers and satisfy 0≤I1≤I2≤L−1. There is
Uj1j2= ei(j1p1+j2p2+θ
2)+ ei(j1p2+j2p1−θ
2), (C.7)
with p1, p2, θbeing solutions to the equation
eiθ=−1 + ei(p1+p2)−2eip1
1 + ei(p1+p2)−2eip2. (C.8)
The normalization factor is
N=X
1≤j1<j2≤L|Uj1j2|2. (C.9)
In the state |I1I2⟩there are two magnons with physical momenta p1, p2and momenta k1, k2related as
p1=2πk1
L, p2=2πk2
L. (C.10)
To the equation (C.8), there are three cases of solutions, namely case I solution, case II solutions,
and case III solutions. The case III solutions could be further classified into case IIIa solutions and
case IIIb solutions.
C.3.1 Case I solution
For the case I solution, there are trivially

which is the same as the probability distribution (E.11) in the configuration of two identical hard-core
classical particles in subsection E.2.2.

with the momentum difference k12=k1−k2and Bethe number difference I12=I1−I2. The
normalization factor is

where ˜Iis an odd integer around 2√

D SSH model
In this appendix, we consider the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model [57,58] of a ring with Lunit cells
H=LX
j=1[v(a†
j,1aj,2+a†
j,2aj,1) +u(a†
j,2aj+1,1+a†
j+1,1aj,2)], (D.1)
which describes electrons hopping on a dimerised lattice. In each unit cell labeled by j= 1,2,···, L,
there are fermionic modes aj,α, a†
j,αwith α= 1,2. We only consider periodic boundary conditions.
One could choose that the hopping constants vinside each unit cell and ubetween neighboring unit
cells are nonnegative real numbers.
The SSH model could be diagonalized by the Fourier transformation

33The Hamiltonian becomes that of the double copies of the free fermionic chains
H=X

k,−ck,−). (D.5)
In the SSH model there are two sets of independent fermionic modes, namely the modes ck,+, c†
k,+
and the modes ck,−, c†
k,−. One may define the empty state |∅⟩as
ck,±|∅⟩= 0, k= 0,1,···, L−1, (D.6)
based on which a general excited states |K+, K−⟩with modes K+={k+

As the modes K+andK−are independent, their contributions to the entanglement entropy and
Shannon entropy are also independent. Then we have the entanglement entropy in the SSH model as
the sum of the entanglement entropies in the free fermionic chain

E Classical particles
This appendix presents the calculation of the Shannon entropy and mutual information for classical
particle configurations on a circular chain. Both soft-core and hard-core particles are considered,
corresponding to the classical limits of bosonic and fermionic quantum particles, respectively.
E.1 Soft-core classical particles
We start with soft-core classical particles, which can have any number of particles at one site, i.e. a
site can be empty, occupied by one particle, or occupied by more than one particle.
E.1.1 One particle
We consider the macroscopic configuration of the chain in which there is one soft-core classical par-
ticle. There are Lpossible microscopic configurations, i.e. the particle at site jwith j∈[1, L], and
probabilities are
pj=1
L, j∈[1, L]. (E.1)
The Shannon entropy of the whole system is
Hsoft
1(L) = log L. (E.2)
34For the subsystem A, there are ℓ+ 1possible microscopic configurations, as shown in Table 7. The
Shannon entropy of the subsystem Ais
Hsoft
1(ℓ) =xlogL−(1−x) log(1 −x). (E.3)
The Shannon mutual information is
Msoft
1(ℓ) =−xlogx−(1−x) log(1 −x), (E.4)
which is just the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of the coarse-grained subsystem
configurations {x,1−x}. Observe that the values of 1−xandxcorrespond to the presence of no
particle and one particle, respectively, in the subsystem A.
microscopic configurations probabilities ranges numbers
no particle in A pA,0= 1−x- 1
one particle in Aatj pA,j=1
Lj∈[1, ℓ] ℓ
Table 7: The microscopic configurations and probabilities of the subsystem Ain the macroscopic
configuration of one soft-core classical particle.
E.1.2 Two identical particles
We consider the macroscopic configuration in which there are two identical particles on the chain. For
the total system, there areL(L+1)
2possible microscopic configurations as shown in Table 8. In the
scaling limit, the Shannon entropy of the total system is
Hsoft
12(L) = 2 log L−log 2. (E.5)
microscopic configurations probabilities ranges numbers

Table 8: The microscopic configurations and probabilities of the total system in the macroscopic
configuration of two identical soft-core classical particles.
For the subsystem A, there are(ℓ+1)(ℓ+2)
2different microscopic configurations, as shown in Table 9.
In the scaling limit, we get the Shannon entropy of the subsystem A
Hsoft
12(ℓ) = 2 xlogL−x(2−x) log 2 −2(1−x) log(1 −x). (E.6)
In the scaling limit, the mutual information is
Msoft
12(ℓ) =−x2logx2−2x(1−x) log[2 x(1−x)]−(1−x)2log(1−x)2
=−2xlogx−2(1−x) log(1 −x)−2x(1−x) log 2 , (E.7)
which is just the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of the coarse-grained subsystem
configurations {x2,2x(1−x),(1−x)2}.

E.1.3 Two distinguishable particle
We consider two distinguishable particles, say one red particle and one blue particle. There are L2
possible microscopic configurations, as shown in Table 10. The Shannon entropy is
Hsoft
12(L) = 2 log L. (E.8)
microscopic configurations probabilities ranges numbers
both at j pj2=1

Table 10: The microscopic configurations and probabilities of the total system in the macroscopic
configuration of two distinguishable soft-core classical particles.
For the subsystem A, there are (ℓ+ 1)( ℓ+ 2)possible configurations, as shown in Table 11. We get
the Shannon entropy of the subsystem
Hsoft
12(ℓ) = 2 xlogL−2(1−x) log(1 −x). (E.9)
The mutual information is
Msoft
12(ℓ) = 2[−xlogx−(1−x) log(1 −x)], (E.10)
which is just the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of the coarse-grained subsystem
configurations {x,1−x} ⊗ { x,1−x}={x2, x(1−x), x(1−x),(1−x)2}.
E.2 Hard-core classical particles
We next consider classical particles with the restriction that a site can have only one particle at most.
E.2.1 One particle
This case of one hard-core classical particle is identical to that of one soft-core classical particle in
subsection E.1.1. We will skip it here.

E.2.2 Two identical particles
We consider two identical hard-core classical particles. There areL(L−1)
2possible microscopic configu-
rations, i.e. that one particle at site j1and the other particle at site j2with 1≤j1< j2≤L, and the
corresponding probabilities are
pj1j2=2
L(L−1),1≤j1< j2≤L. (E.11)
In the scaling limit, the Shannon entropy of the total system is

12(L) = 2 log L−log 2. (E.12)
For the subsystem A, there areℓ(ℓ+1)
2+ 1possible configurations, as shown in Table 12. In the
scaling limit, we get the Shannon entropy of the subsystem
Hhard
12(ℓ) = 2 xlogL−2(1−x) log(1 −x)−x(2−x) log 2 . (E.13)
In the scaling limit, the mutual information is

=−x2logx2−2x(1−x) log[2 x(1−x)]−(1−x)2log(1−x)2,(E.14)
which is just the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution {x2,2x(1−x),(1−x)2}. In the
scaling limit, the results in this subsection are the same as those in subsection E.1.2.

37E.2.3 Two distinguishable particles
We consider two distinguishable particles, say one red particle and one blue particle. There are L(L−1)
possible microscopic configurations, i.e. that the red particle at site j1and the blue particle at site j2
with j1, j2∈[1, L]andj1̸=j2, and the corresponding probabilities are
pj1j2=1
L(L−1), j1, j2∈[1, L], j1̸=j2. (E.15)

For the subsystem A, there are ℓ2+ℓ+ 1possible configurations, as shown in Table 13. In the

12(ℓ) = 2 xlogL−2(1−x) log(1 −x). (E.17)
In the scaling limit, the mutual information is

12(ℓ) = 2[−xlogx−(1−x) log(1 −x)], (E.18)
which is just the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution {x,1−x} ⊗ { x,1−x}={x2, x(1−
x), x(1−x),(1−x)2}. In the scaling limit, the results in this subsection are the same as those in
subsection E.1.3.

E.3 Summary and generalization
When the number of particles is finite, the Shannon entropy and mutual information in the scaling
limit only depend on the number of particles and how distinguishable they are, not on the limit of the
number of particles at each site. This means that we get the same results for soft-core and hard-core
classical particles in the scaling limit. Moreover, the Shannon mutual information is equal to the
Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of the coarse-grained subsystem configurations.
We summarize the results in this appendix as follows. For the macroscopic configuration of one
classical particle, in the scaling limit we get the total system Shannon entropy, subsystem Shannon
38entropy and mutual information

For two identical classical particles, we get
Hcl
12(L) = 2 log L−log 2, (E.22)

For two distinguishable classical particles, we get

Mcl
12(ℓ) =−2xlogx−2(1−x) log(1 −x). (E.27)
For more general cases, we just show the final results without giving any calculation details. For r

i-th kind of particles being ri,i= 1,2,···, sand total number of particles R=Ps

1ri(ℓ). (E.33)
In the scaling limit, the contributions of different classical particles to the total system Shannon
entropy, subsystem Shannon entropy and mutual information become independent. However, the
Shannon entropy and mutual information of quantum quasiparticles do not exhibit such decoupling
property even in the limit of large momentum difference, as shown in the main text of the paper.
39F Shannon entropy of particle number probability distribution
In this section, we determine the Shannon entropy for the probability distribution of subsystem particle
numbers in free bosonic and fermionic chains, which are just the number entropy studied in for example
[15,65,66]. The semiclassical quasiparticle picture applies to the Shannon entropy of particle number
probability distribution in the large momentum difference limit.
F.1 Classical particles
For finite number of classical particles in the scaling limit, the subsystem Shannon entropy of particle
number probability distribution only depends on the total number of particles R, regardless the dis-
tinguishability of these particles. The result is also not dependent on the limit of the particle number
at one site. In the limit R≪ℓ < L, the result is just the Shannon entropy of a binomial probability
distribution

In the single-particle state |k⟩and double-particle state |k2⟩of the free bosonic chain, the results are
trivial and the same as those of classical particles. We skip the calculations here.
In the double-particle state |k1k2⟩, the probabilities of finding zero, one, and two particles in the
subsystem A= [1, ℓ]are respectively

G Shannon entropy in σx
jbasis of XXX chain
This appendix focuses on the investigation of the Shannon entropy in the local basis of eigenstates of
σx
jfor the XXX chain.3
G.1 The σx
jbasis
For a single set of Pauli matrices {σx, σy, σz}, the eigenstates of σxis
|±⟩=1√
2(|↑⟩ ± |↓⟩ ). (G.1)
In the local basis of σx
jeigenstates, there are local states which we denote as |X⟩withXbeing a
set of numbers in the range [1, L]. In the state |X⟩, the site j /∈ Xhas spin |+⟩and the site j∈ Xhas
spin|−⟩. For example, in this appendix we use the local states
|∅⟩=|+ +···+⟩,
|j⟩=|··· − j···⟩,
|j1j2⟩=|··· − j1··· − j2···⟩, (G.2)
where all the omitted sites have spin |+⟩. For the total system with Lsites, there are 2Lstates {|X⟩}
inσx
jbasis. For the subsystem A= [1, ℓ], there are similarly 2ℓstates {|X⟩ A}.
3We thank M. A. Rajabpour for suggesting us to look into the case of Shannon entropy in the σx
jlocal basis.
41G.2 Ground state
In the ground state of the ferromagnetic XXX chain |G⟩=|↑↑ ··· ↑⟩ , the probability of the local state
|X⟩is
pG
X=1
2L, (G.3)
from which we get the Shannon entropy of the total system
HXXX
G(L) =Llog 2. (G.4)
Similarly, we get the probability of the local state |X⟩A
pA,G
X=1
2ℓ, (G.5)
and the subsystem Shannon entropy
HXXX
G(ℓ) =ℓlog 2. (G.6)
Note that the total system and subsystem Shannon entropies take the maximal values. The subsystem
Shannon mutual information is trivial
MXXX
G(ℓ) = 0 . (G.7)
G.3 Single-magnon state
In the single-magnon state
|I⟩=1√
LLX
j=1e2πijI
L|j⟩, I= 0,1,···, L−1, (G.8)
the probability of the local state |X⟩of the total system is
pI
X=1
2LLLX
j=1e2πijI
Lmj,X2
, (G.9)
with mj,X= 1forj /∈ Xandmj,X=−1forj∈ X. The total system Shannon entropy could be
evaluated numerically as
HXXX
I(L) =−X
XpI
XlogpI
X. (G.10)
Similarly, the probability of the subsystem local state |X⟩Ais
pA,I
X=1
2ℓ
1−ℓ
L+1
LℓX
j=1e2πijI
Lmj,X2
, (G.11)
from which we calculate the subsystem Shannon entropy as
HXXX
I(ℓ) =−X
XpA,I
XlogpA,I
X. (G.12)
The subsystem Shannon mutual information is
MXXX
I(ℓ) =HXXX
I(ℓ) +HXXX
I(L−ℓ)−HXXX
I(L). (G.13)

Figure 18: The σx
jbasis subsystem Shannon mutual information MXXX
I(ℓ)(G.13) in the single-magnon
state of the XXX chain.
For general I, the evaluations of the σx
jbasis total system Shannon entropy and the subsystem
Shannon entropy and mutual information are exponentially difficult problems, and we could only
numerically calculate them for not so large L, say L≤36. It is easy to see that both the total
system and subsystem Shannon entropies HXXX
I(L)(G.10) and HXXX
I(ℓ)(G.12) are invariant under
the changes I→L−IandI→L
2−I, and so without loss of generality we only need to consider Iin
the range [1, L/4]. We show the numerical results of HXXX
I(L)(G.10), HXXX
I(ℓ)(G.12), and MXXX
I(ℓ)
(G.13) in, respectively figures 16, 17 and 18. From Figure 16, we see that in large Llimit the total
system Shannon entropy takes the form
HXXX
I(L) =Llog 2−CI, (G.19)
with CIbeing a constant that depends on the relative values of IandL. We anticipate that for most
values of Ithere is the universal constant CI≈0.41, and for a few exception values of Ithe constant CI
may take some exceptional values, like the cases I= 0andI=L/2discussed above. From Figure 17,
in the scaling limit the subsystem Shannon entropy takes the form
HXXX
I(ℓ) =ℓlog 2−FI(x), (G.20)
with the I-dependence function FI(x). From Figure 18, in the scaling limit the subsystem Shannon
mutual information takes the form
MXXX
I(ℓ) =GI(x), (G.21)
44with the I-dependence function GI(x). We expect that in the scaling limit, for I≫1with a few
possible exceptional values excluded, the functions FI(x)andGI(x)will take on respective universal
forms.
