Abstract
We characterize weakly harmonic maps with respect to non-local Dir ichlet forms by
Markovprocessesandmartingales. In particular, wecanobtain dis continuousmartingales
on Riemannian manifolds from the image of symmetric stable processe s under fractional
harmonic maps in a weak sense. Based on this characterization, we a lso consider the
continuity of weakly harmonic maps along the paths of Markov proce sses and describe
the condition for the continuity of harmonic maps by quadratic varia tions of martingales
in some situations containing cases of energy minimizing maps.

1 Introduction
Harmonic maps are critical points of the Dirichlet energy de ﬁned on the space of maps
between two manifolds. There are a lot of studies about harmo nic maps from both analytic
and geometric points of view. The regularity of harmonic map s is one of the most important
problems. In general it is known that harmonic maps have sing ular points by the
non-linearity of the Euler-Lagrange equation obtained fro m the variational problem for the
Dirichlet energy. The theory of partial regularity for harm onic maps was obtained in [25,26]
for energy minimizing maps, and in [4,11] for stationary har monic maps.
On the other hand, harmonic maps are related to the theory of p robability and they also
have been studied through stochastic processes. In fact, we can easily show by Itˆ o’s formula
that smooth harmonic maps map Brownian motions on domain man ifolds to martingales on
target manifolds. In [23], it was shown that this probabilis tic characterization of harmonic
maps is valid even for weakly harmonic maps with respect to st rongly local Dirichlet forms.
Regularity of harmonic maps has been also considered form th e view point of the theory of
probability. The regularity of harmonic maps with values in spaces with a kind of convex
geometry has been shown in [2,22].
Recently, fractional harmonic maps, which are critical poi nts of the fractional Dirichlet
energy, are also studied. The study of fractional harmonic m aps is initiated in [9,10] and the
regularity theory for1
2-harmonic lines was obtained in those articles. The partial regularity

2-harmonic maps has been shown in [17]. Recently, for α∈(0,2), the partial regularity
forα
2-harmonic maps with values in spheres has been obtained in [1 6].
In this paper, we ﬁrst obtain a probabilistic characterizat ion of harmonic maps with respect
to regular Dirichlet forms which are not necessarily strong ly local. This result is the
extension of that of [23]. Fractional harmonic mas are one of the most typical examples of
such harmonic maps. To study harmonic maps for general regul ar Dirichlet forms by
stochastic processes, we will apply the theory of martingal es with jumps on a submanifold.
Discontinuous martingales on manifolds are ﬁrst introduce d in [20] and further studied in
[21]. Recently, some properties concerning the convergenc e of discontinuous martingales
have been studied in the author’s previous paper [19] for the purpose of applications to
harmonic maps.
To state the characterization of harmonic maps by martingal es on submanifold in a general
situation, we brieﬂy specify the setting. Let Ebe a locally compact and separable metric
space,ma positive Radon measure with full support on E, and (E,F) a regular Dirichlet
form onL2(E;m). For a special standard core Cand an open set D⊂E, we denote by CD
the family of functions in Cwhose supports are included in D. LetMbe a Riemannian
submanifold of a higher dimensional Euclidean space Rd. For a map
u= (u1,...,ud):E→M⊂Rdsuch thatui∈ FD
locsatisﬁes some conditions, we can
consider the following equation:
d/summationdisplay
i=1E(ui,ψi) = 0,for allψ∈ CD(Rd) withψ(z)∈Tu(z)Mform-a.e.z∈E, (1.1)
where
CD(Rd) ={ψ= (ψ1,...,ψd):E→Rd|ψi∈ CDfor eachi= 1,...,d}.
We can regard (1.1) as the Euler-Lagrange equation with resp ect to the energy functional E.
A mapu:E→Msatisfying (1.1) is called a weakly harmonic map on D. On the other
hand, a regular Dirichlet form determines a symmetric Hunt p rocess onE. We deﬁne a
quasi-harmonic map as a map which maps the symmetric Hunt pro cess to a martingale on
M. The equivalence of weakly harmonic maps and quasi-harmoni c maps was shown in [23]
in the case where ( E,F) is strongly local transient regular Dirichlet form and uis in the
reﬂected Dirichlet space. On the other hand, harmonic funct ions inFD
locfor general regular
Dirichlet form were characterized by stochastic processes in [5]. (In this paper, we mainly
refer to Chapter 6 of [7].) By combining [5,23], and the theor y of stochastic integrals along
CAF’s of zero energy developed in [6,15,18,29], we obtain th e non-local version of the result
of [23]. To simplify the statement, we only state the case tha t a target manifold Mis
compact in Theorem 1.1 below, but we will show this kind of res ult under more general
situations in Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 and those results in Secti on 3 include Proposition 4 of
[23].
Theorem 1.1. LetMbe a compact Riemannian submanifold of Rd. We assume that a
Borel measurable map u:E→Mis inFD
loc(M)and quasi-continuous on D. Thenuis
weakly harmonic on Dif and only if uis quasi-harmonic on D.
As a particular case of Theorem 1.1, we can obtain a discontin uous martingale on a
submanifold by substituting an α-symmetric stable process into a map satisfying the
Lagrange equation with respect to the fractional Laplacian . In this way, the fractional
harmonic map discussed in [9,10] can be studied by using stoc hastic processes.
2Next we will consider singularities of harmonic maps. Singu larities of harmonic map heat
ﬂows with smooth initial data appearing at their explosion t imes were dealt with through
stochastic processes in [27,28]. In this paper, we will deal with singularities of harmonic
maps in a weak sense including fractional harmonic maps base d on Theorem 1.1. In this
situation, the continuity of martingales obtained from har monic maps at time zero can be
thought as the continuity of harmonic maps along the paths of Markov processes. This kind
of continuity corresponds to the continuity in the ﬁne topol ogy in classical potential theory.
In [19], it was shown that the equivalent condition of the ﬁne continuity of quasi-harmonic
maps for Markov processes with jumps can be described by quad ratic variations of
martingales on manifolds. By combining Theorem 1.1 above an d Proposition 4.11 of [19], we
can obtain some equivalent conditions of the ﬁne continuity of weakly harmonic maps with
respect to general regular Dirichlet forms through marting ales on manifolds. However, we
note that the ﬁne continuity is much weaker than the continui ty in the topology of metric
spaces in general. We will remark the equivalence does not ho ld for general weakly
harmonic maps with respect to the Laplacian. One of the count erexamples is the
everywhere-discontinuous weakly harmonic map constructe d in [24]. However, if we consider
a class of weakly harmonic maps with respect to the Laplacian and the fractional Laplacian
which satisfy some assumptions regarding tangent maps, we c an easily show that the
equivalence holds. The precise assumptions and statement w ill be given in Assumption 4.7
and Proposition 4.11, respectively. Typical examples sati sfying these assumptions are
energy minimizing maps.
We give an outline of the paper. In Section 2, we ﬁrst recall so me facts regarding symmetric
Markov processes and Dirichlet forms. Mainly we refer to [7, 12]. In addition, we recall the
stochastic integral along continuous additive functional s of zero energy. In Section 3, we
characterize harmonic maps with respect to regular Dirichl et forms by martingales on
manifolds. In Section 4, we describe the connection between sinularities of weakly harmonic
maps and those of martingales.
Throughout this paper, given a topological space M, we denote by C0(M) the set of all
continuous functions on Mwith compact support. In the case that Mis a manifold, we
denote byC∞
0(M) the set of all C∞functions with compact support. For a,b∈R, we
abbreviate max {a, b}and min{a, b}asa∨banda∧b, respectively. For a stochastic process
Hand a stopping time τ, we write the stopped process as Hτdeﬁned by
Hτ
t(ω) =Ht∧τ(ω)(ω).
For two random variables X,Y, we writeX∼Yif they have the same distribution.
2 Preliminaries on Markov processes
In this section, we recall the theory of Markov processes and Dirichlet forms in preparation
for the proof of the main theorem. In particular, we focus on t he stochastic integral along
CAF’s of zero energy introduced in [18] and further studied i n [6,15,29]. As for the general
theory of Dirichlet forms, see [7,12] for details.
LetEbe a locally compact and separable metric space. We add a poin t ∆ toEand deﬁne
E∆:=E∪{∆}. Givenf∈ B(E), we extend the domain of ftoE∆byf(∆) = 0. Let mbe
a positive Radon measure with full support on E. LetFbe a dense subspace of L2(E;m)
andE:F ×F → Ra non-negative deﬁnite symmetric quadratic form. We set
Eα(u,v) :=E(u,v)+α/a\}b∇acketle{tu,v/a\}b∇acket∇i}htL2
3foru,v∈ Fandα>0. The pair ( E,F) is called a Dirichlet form if the space ( F,E1) is a
Hilbert space and it holds that ( u∨0)∧1∈ Fand
E((u∨0)∧1,(u∨0)∧1)≤ E(u,u)
for anyu∈ F. A Dirichlet form ( E,F) is said to be regular if F ∩C0(E) isE1-dense in F
and/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbl∞-dense inC0(E). For a regular Dirichlet form, the extended Dirichlet spac eFeis
deﬁned as the family of equivalence classes of Borel functio nsu:E→Rwith respect to the
m-a.e. equality such that |u|<∞m-a.e. and there exists an E-Cauchy sequence {uk}∞

E(u,u) := lim

where{uk}∞

there exists an m-symmetric Hunt process (Ω ,{Z}t≥0,{θt}t≥0,ζ,{Pz}z∈E∆) onE
corresponding to ( E,F), whereθt: Ω→Ω is the shift operator satisfying for all ω∈Ω,

For a subset A⊂E∆, deﬁne the random time σAby
σA(ω) := inf{t>0|Zt(ω)∈A}, ω∈Ω,
τA(ω) := inf{t>0|Zt(ω)/∈A}, ω∈Ω.

Uαµis called an α-potential. We denote by S0the family of all positive Radon measures of
ﬁnite energy integrals. We set a subset S00ofS0as
S00:={µ∈S0|µ(E)<∞,/ba∇dblU1µ/ba∇dbl∞<∞}. (2.1)
We use the abbreviation AF (resp. CAF) for additive function al (resp. continuous additive

Each additive functional in Mis called a martingale additive functional (MAF). For detai ls
about MAF’s, see [12,13]. For u∈ Fe, setA[u]
t:= ˜u(Xt)−˜u(X0), where ˜uis a
quasi-continuous modiﬁcation of u. ThenA[u]is an additive functional of Zwith ﬁnite
energy. Moreover, by [12,13], there exists M[u]∈˚MandN[u]∈ Ncsuch that

continuous part, jump part, and killing part as follows. Sin ceM[u]is aPz-martingale for
q.e.z∈E, the MAF M[u]can be written as the sum of its continuous martingale part
M[u],cand purely discontinuous martingale part M[u],dand we can construct M[u],cand

We denote the family of purely discontinuous MAF’s of ﬁnite e nergy by˚Md. In [15], it was
shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between˚Mdand the family of jump
functions deﬁned by
˚J:={φ:E∆×E∆→[0,∞)|φ: Borel measurable , φ(z,z) = 0 for all z∈E∆,
N(φ2)µHis a ﬁnite Radon measure which is null on each m-polar set }.
6Forφ,ψ∈˚J, we denote φ∼ψifφ=ψ N(z,dw)µH(dz)-a.e. onE×E∆. Lemma 2.5 of [15]
guarantees that for all φ∈˚J, there exists M∈˚Mdsuch that
Mt−Mt−=φ(Zt−,Zt), t≥0, Pz-a.s. q.e.z∈E
and this is a one-to-one correspondence between ˚J/∼and˚Md. In particular, for M∈˚Md,
there exists K∈˚Mdsuch that

whereφis the jump function corresponding to Mand¯φ(z,w) :=φ(w,z) sinceφ+¯φ∈˚J.

by Lemma 2.2. Thus we can deduce that the integral (2.6) is wel l-deﬁned.
Deﬁnition 2.5. LetHbe a function on [0,∞)×ΩandM∈˚M. LetJ=H+Γ(M).
Suppose that the process t→Ht∧τD1is aPz-local mimartingale for q.e. z∈E. Then for

Remark 2.6. The integral is well-deﬁned, i.e. the right-hand side is ind ependent of the
choice of a function H′: [0,∞)×Ω→RandM′∈˚Msuch thatH′τD1is aPz-local
martingale for q.e. z∈Eand
HτD1+Γ(M)τD1= (H′)τD1+Γ(M′)τD1.
In fact, we have HτD1−(H′)τD1= Γ(L)τD1, whereL=M′−M, and consequently,
HτD1−(H′)τD1is a CAF of ZD1which is a Pz-local martingale for q.e. z∈E. For a

10On the other hand, we can deﬁne the quadratic variation of Γ( L)τD1as aPz-continuous

deduce that
Γ(M)t∧τD1= Γ(M′)t∧τD1, t≥0,Pz-a.s. q.e.z∈D1.
Forz∈E\D1, it is obvious that Γ( M)τD1= Γ(M′)τD1= 0,Pz-a.s. Thus the decomposition

3 Proof of Theorem 1.1
First we deﬁne martingales and harmonic maps with respect to regular Dirichlet forms. The
theory of discontinuous martingales on manifolds was devel oped in [20]. In [19], the author
focused on discontinuous martingales on Riemannian subman ifolds of higher dimensional
Euclidean spaces as a special case considered in [20], and th en extended them so that we
allowed the killing of martingales. We begin with recalling semimartingales and martingales
deﬁned in [19]. Let Mbe a Riemannian submanifold of Rd.
Deﬁnition 3.1. LetXbe anRd-valued semimartingale, ζan{Ft}t≥0-stopping time and p
a point in Rd. We call (X,ζ,p)anM-valued semimartingale with the the end point pif it
satisﬁesXt∈Mfort∈[0,ζ)andXt=pfort≥ζa.s.
Ifp∈Morζ=∞almost surely, then an M-valued semimartingale Xwith the end point p
is just anM-valued semimartingale in a usual sense.
Deﬁnition 3.2. Let(X,ζ,p)be anM-valued{Ft}t≥0-semimartingale with the end point p.
The triple (X,ζ,p)is called an M-valued martingale with the end point pif for any smooth
vector ﬁeld VonM, the stochastic integral/integraldisplay
/a\}b∇acketle{tV(X−),dX/a\}b∇acket∇i}htis a local martingale.
Deﬁnition 3.3. A Borel measurable map u:E→Mis said to be quasi-harmonic on Dif
for each relatively compact open set D1such thatD1⊂D,(u(Z)τD1,ζ,0)is anM-valued
(Pz,{FZ
t})-martingale with an end point for q.e. z∈E.
In Deﬁnition 3.3, we set 0 ∈Rdas the end point since we set the value of a function on E∆
at ∆ as 0. If Zhas no inside killing, uis quasi-harmonic on Dif and only if for each
relatively compact open set D1such thatD1⊂D,{u(Zt∧τD1)}t≥0is anM-valued
Pz-martingale for q.e. z∈E.
Next we will recall the following conditions for a function u∈ FD

[5] and Chapter 6 of [7]: For any relatively compact open set D1,D2with

A−
t:=1{t≥τD1}{(1−φ(ZτD1))u−(ZτD1)−(1−φ(ZτD1−))u−(ZτD1−)}.

Theorem 3.7. Letu:E→Mbe a Borel measurable map in FD
loc(M)which is locally

13Theorem 3.8. Letu∈ FD
loc(M)be quasi-harmonic on D, locally bounded on Dand satisfy
(A)and(B). Thenuis weakly harmonic on D.
Proof of Theorem 3.7. Letφ=φD2,h1(z) :=Ez/bracketleftBig

h2(z) :=Ez/bracketleftBig

This enables us to see the stochastic integral along N[vj]

Thusuis a weakly harmonic map on D.
16Proof of Theorem 1.1. Suppose that Mis compact and u∈ FD
loc(M). Thenuis bounded
and satisﬁes (A) and (B) by Lemma 6.7.6 of [7]. Therefore the e quivalence of the weak
harmonicity and the quasi-harmonicity for uholds by Theorems 3.7 and 3.8.
Remark 3.9. According to Theorem 2.9 of [5], the stronger result holds fo r harmonic
functions than Theorem 3.8 above. Let D⊂Ebe an open set with m(D)<∞andua
function on Esatisfyingu∈L∞(D;m) and condition ( A) so that {˜u(Zt∧τD}t≥0is a
Pz-uniformly integrable martingale for q.e. z∈E. Then by Theorem 2.9 of [5], the function
uis automatically in FD
loc. We have not established such a result for harmonic maps as we
have not taken into account the counterpart of the uniform in tegrability of martingales on
manifolds. Without considering the condition analogous to the uniform integrability for
martingales on manifolds, the counterpart of the statement of Theorem 2.9 of [5] does not
hold for harmonic maps with values in compact manifolds. Let ube a map from the
2-dimensional unit ball to the circle given as u(z) :=z
|z|. Thenuis bounded and maps any
Brownian motion to a martingale, but the energy of uis inﬁnite around the origin.
4 Fine continuity of weakly harmonic maps
In this section, we consider the continuity of weakly harmon ic maps along the paths of
Markov processes in some situations. We assume that the targ et manifold Mis compact.
First we refer to [19] for the deﬁnition of martingales on man ifolds indexed by positive time.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let{Xt}t>0be a process indexed by t∈(0,∞). Suppose that there exist an
{Ft}t≥0-stopping time ζand a point p∈Rdsuch thatXt∈Mfort∈[0,ζ)andXt=pfor
t≥ζ. We call ({Xt}t>0,ζ,p)anM-valued martingale with an end point indexed by
t∈(0,∞)if for allε>0,({Xt+ε}t≥0,(ζ−ε)∨0,p)is anM-valued{Ft+ε}t≥0-martingale
with the end point p.
Proposition 4.2 below provides the equivalent condition fo r the continuity of weakly
harmonic maps along the paths of Markov processes which is ca lled the ﬁne continuity. For
anM-valued martingale ( {Xt}t>0,ζ,p) with an end point, we denote the quadratic variation
ofXas anRd-valued semimartingale by [ X,X]ε
ton the interval ( ε,t]. We write the dual
predictable projection of [ X,X]ε
tas/a\}b∇acketle{tX,X/a\}b∇acket∇i}htε
t.
Proposition 4.2. LetD⊂Ebe an open set and u:E→Ma Borel measurable map in
FD
loc(M)which is quasi-continuous on Dwith respect to a regular Dirichlet form (E,F). We
suppose that uis a weakly harmonic map on D. We further suppose that the transition
function {pt}t≥0ofZsatisﬁes the condition of absolute continuity, i.e. there e xists a Borel
measurable function p: [0,∞)×E×E→[0,∞]such that
ptf(z) =/integraldisplay
Ef(w)pt(t,z,w)m(dw),for allf∈ B+(E).
Then for all z∈Dand a relatively compact open set D1such thatD1⊂D, the process
{u(Zt)τD1}t>0is anM-valued(Pz,{Ft}t>0)-martingale with the end point 0indexed by
t∈(0,∞). Moreover, for each z0∈D1, the following are equivalent:
(i)lim
t→0u(Zt)τD1exists inM,Pz-a.s.;
17(ii){u(Zt)τD1}t>0can be extended to an M-valuedPz-martingale with an end point
indexed by t≥0;
(iii)lim
ε→0[u(Z)τD1,u(Z)τD1]ε
t<∞,Pz-a.s.;
(iv)lim
ε→0/a\}b∇acketle{tu(Z)τD1,u(Z)τD1/a\}b∇acket∇i}htε
t<∞,Pz-a.s.
Proof.By Theorem 1.1, the map uis quasi-harmonic on D. Moreover, by the absolute
continuity of the transition function, the triple ( {u(Zt)τD1}t>0,ζ,0) is anM-valued
Pz-martingale indexed by t∈(0,∞) for allz∈D1. (See Lemma 4.10 of [19] for details.)
Thus the equivalence among (i) through (iii) in Proposition 4.2 can be shown by Theorem
1.2 of [19]. The equivalence of (i) and (iv) can be veriﬁed by L emma 4.3 below.
Lemma 4.3. LetMbe a compact submanifold of Rdand({Xt}t>0,ζ,p)anM-valued
martingale with an end point indexed by t>0. Then the following are equivalent:
(i)lim
t→0Xtexists almost surely;
(ii)lim
ε→0/a\}b∇acketle{tX,X/a\}b∇acket∇i}htε
t<∞almost surely.
Remark 4.4. In (ii) of Lemma 4.3, the existence of lim
ε→0/a\}b∇acketle{tX,X/a\}b∇acket∇i}htε
tis guaranteed by the
monotonicity obtained from (4.2) and (4.5) below.
Proof of Lemma 4.3. First we assume (i). Then we have lim
ε→0[X,X]ε
t<∞and consequently,
the process {Xt}t≥0is anM-valued martingale with the end point pby Theorem 1.2 of [19].
LetAbe the dual predictable projection of [ X,X]. Then we have
At−Aε=/a\}b∇acketle{tX,X/a\}b∇acket∇i}htε

Thus (ii) follows.
Next we assume (ii). We set a= sup

µε1(ω,(t1,t2]×J) =µε2(ω,(t1,t2]×J)+µε1(ω,(t1,t2∧ε2]×J).
Thus we have
νε1(ω,(t1,t2]×J) =νε2(ω,(t1,t2]×J)+νε1(ω,(t1,t2∧ε2]×J). (4.2)

19To consider the continuity of weakly harmonic maps in the top ology with respect to the
metric onEand compare it with the ﬁne continuity, hereafter we limit th e scope of the
metric space Eto either of the following two cases as domains of harmonic ma ps:
Case 1. Letm≥3 and


F=H1(Rm)
E(u,v) =/integraldisplay
Rm∇u(z)·∇v(z)dz.
For a bounded smooth domain D⊂Rmwith smooth boundary and u∈H1
loc(D), we
set
/hatwideED(u) :=/integraldisplay
D|∇u|2(z)dz.
In this case, if we set
/hatwideH1(D) :={u∈L2
loc(Rm)|/hatwideED(u)<∞},
then/hatwideH1(D) =H1(D).
Case 2. Letm≥2,α∈(0,2) and


F=Hα
2(Rm)
E(u,v) =cm,α/integraldisplay
Rm×Rm(˜u(z)−˜u(w))(˜v(z)−˜v(w))

For a bounded smooth domain D∈Rmwith smooth boundary and u∈L2

See [16] for details about the space /hatwideHα
2(D).
The corresponding Markov processes Zare Brownian motion and α-stable process in Case 1
and Case 2, respectively.
Remark 4.5. In [24], T. Rivi´ ere constructed a weakly harmonic map uwith respect to the
Dirichlet energy from the 3-dimensional unit ball B1into the 2-dimensional unit sphere S2
which is everywhere discontinuous. On the other hand, uhas a quasi-continuous
modiﬁcation since the Dirichlet energy of uis ﬁnite. Thus there is a diﬀerence between the
continuity in the Euclidean topology and that in the ﬁne topo logy if we do not impose any
restrictions for harmonic maps.
20Deﬁnition 4.6. We assume the setting of either Case 1 or Case 2. Let u∈ FD
loc(M)be a
weakly harmonic map. Fix z0∈Dandρ>0such thatBρ(z0)⊂D. Thenϕ:Rd→Mis
called a tangent map of uatz0if for allR>0, there exists a decreasing sequence {ri}∞
i=1
withri→0,r1<ρ
Rsuch that
uz0,ri→ϕweakly in (/hatwideFBR,/hatwideEBR)asi→ ∞,whereuz0,r(z) :=u(z0+rz),
where
/hatwideFBR:={v:E→Rd|vi∈L2
loc(Rd), i= 1,...,d,/hatwideEBR(v)<∞}.
To see the equivalence of the continuity in Euclidean topolo gy and that in ﬁne topology in
some cases, we impose some conditions on weakly harmonic map s.
Assumption 4.7. We assume the setting of either Case 1 or Case 2. Let u∈ FD
loc(M) be a
weakly harmonic map with /hatwideED(u). For each z0∈Dand tangent map ϕofuatz0, we
assume that usatisﬁes the following two conditions.
(i)Under the notation in Deﬁnition 4.6, there exists a subseque nce{rij}such that
/hatwideEBR(uz0,rij−ϕ)→0 asj→ ∞.
(ii)uandϕhave modiﬁcations which are continuous quasi-everywhere. In addition, uis
continuous at z0if and only if any tangent map at z0is constant almost everywhere.
We remark that there are enough examples satisfying Assumpt ion 4.7 as follows.
Example 4.8. In Case 1, we set
H1(D;M) :={u∈ FD
loc(M)|/hatwideED(u)<∞}.
We say that u∈H1(D;M) is an energy minimizing map on Dif it satisﬁes
/hatwideED(u)≤/hatwideED(u′)
for allu′∈H1(D;M) with
supp[u−u′]⊂D,
where [·] is the support of a vector-valued function. Every energy mi nimizing map uis a
weakly harmonic map and Assumption 4.7 is satisﬁed by the res ult of [25].
Example 4.9. In Case 1, we further suppose M=Sn. A weakly harmonic map
u∈H1(D;Sn) is said to be stationary if
d
dt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
t=0/hatwideE(u◦Φt) = 0 for all X ∈C1
0(D;Rm),
where{Φt}t∈Ris the integral curves of the vector ﬁeld X. Furthermore, uis said to be
stable if
d2
dt2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
t=0/hatwideE/parenleftbiggu+tψ
|u+tψ|/parenrightbigg
≥0
for allψ∈C∞
0(D;Rn+1) withu(z)·ψ(z) = 0 a.e.z∈D. Ifu∈H1(D;Sn) is a stable
stationary harmonic map, then Assumption 4.7 is satisﬁed by [11,14].
21Example 4.10. In Case 2, we further suppose that M=Sn. Then we can deﬁne
minimizing or stationary harmonic maps with respect to the f ractional Dirichlet energy in
the same way as Example 4.8 and Example 4.9. In [16], it was sho wn that Assumption 4.7 is
satisﬁed in the following two cases.
•α∈(0,2)\{1},n>α, anduis a stationaryα
2-harmonic map.
•uis a minimizing1
2-harmonic map.
Before stating Proposition 4.11 below, we recall a censored α-stable process and a reﬂecting
α-stable process. For an open set D, we set


C={u∈L2(D)∩B(D)| D(u,u)<∞},
D(u,v) =cm,α/integraldisplay
D×D(u(z)−u(w))(v(z)−v(w))
|z−w|m+αdwdz,(4.6)
Then (D,C) is a Dirichlet form on L2(D). If we further suppose that Dis a smooth domain,
then the space Cis identical to Hα
2(D) and the pair ( D,C) becomes a regular Dirichlet form
onL2(D). The corresponding Hunt process ( Z∗,P∗
z) is called a reﬂecting α-stable process.
For a process Hand a stopping time τ, we set
Hτ−
t:=Ht1[0,τ)(t)+Hτ−1[τ,∞)
Proposition 4.11. In addition to the setting of Proposition 4.2, we further assu me the
setting of either Case 1 or Case 2. Let u∈ FD
loc(M)be a weakly harmonic map satisfying
Assumption 4.7. Then for z0∈D, the following (v) is also equivalent to (i)–(iv) in
Proposition 4.2.
(v)uhas a modiﬁcation which is continuous at z0.
Remark 4.12. As for Case 1, we can show Proposition 4.11 above by the applic ation of
Wiener’s criterion from classical potential theory. If uis ﬁnely continuous at z0, then it
holds that
lim
r→0u(z0+rz) =u(z0) for a.e.z∈D (4.7)
by [8] or Theorem 7.8.1 of [1]. Let ϕbe a tangent map at z0. Fixρ>0 such that
Bρ(z0)⊂D.Then (i) of Assumption 4.7 enables us to take a decreasing seq uence
r1≥r2≥ ··· → 0 such that for all R>0,
/hatwideEBR(uz0,ri−ϕ)→0 asi→ ∞.
By the Sobolev embedding theorem, we have
lim
i→∞/integraldisplay
BR|uz0,ri(z)−ϕ(z)|2dz= 0.
Thus by the bounded convergence theorem, we have
/integraldisplay
BR|u(z0)−ϕ(z)|2dz= 0.
22This means that any tangent map of uatz0is a.e. constant. Thus by (ii) of
Assumption 4.7, uis continuous at z0.
Unfortunately, the same proof does not work in Case 2. Indeed , we can construct a function
f:Rm→Rwhich is ﬁnely continuous at 0 but does not have a modiﬁcation satisfying (4.7).
Letm≥2 andα∈(0,1]. We set
Sε
r:={z∈Rm|r−ε≤ |z| ≤r+ε}
for 0<ε<r. Sinceα∈(0,1] yields Cap0(Sr)=0, we have
lim
ε→0Cap0(Sε
r) = 0,
where Cap0is the outer 0-capacity with respect to the Riesz kernel gwith index αdeﬁned by
g(z,w) =cm,α
|z−w|m−α.
For ﬁxedλ>1, we set
rn:=1
2c1
m−αm,α/parenleftBig
λ−n
m−α−λ−n+1
m−α/parenrightBig
and takeεn>0 such that
Cap0(Sεnrn)<2−nλ−n.
We set
S:=∞/uniondisplay
n=1Sεnrn,
An:={z∈S|λn≤g(0,z)≤λn+1}.
Then∞/summationdisplay
n=1λnCap0(An∩S)<1.
Thus the Wiener’s criterion for the Riesz kernel yields that Sis thin at 0, i.e.
P0(σS= 0) = 0.
(We can completely track the probabilistic proof of Wiener’ s criterion in [3] even in the case
of the Riesz kernel.) Therefore, if we set f:=1S, thenfis ﬁnely continuous at 0 but
obviously there does not exist a modiﬁcation of fsatisfying (4.7).
Proof of Proposition 4.11 in Case 2. We only have to show that (i) yields (v). Fix R>0.
Then we can assume that the sequence {ri}∞
i=1satisﬁesBr1R(z0)⊂Dwithout loss of
generality. We set ϕj:=uz0,ri(j)−ϕ. Let (D,C) be a Dirichlet form deﬁned in the same way
as (4.6) on BRand (Z∗,P∗
z) be a reﬂecting α-stable process on BR. Then by assumption,
D(ϕj,ϕj)≤/hatwideEBR(ϕj,ϕj)→0 asj→ ∞.
This implies that
P∗
z(ϕj(Z∗
t)→0 uniformly in t∈[0,∞) asj→ ∞) = 1 for q.e. z∈BR.
23SinceZ∗has the transition density, we have
P∗
z(ϕj(Z∗
t)→0 uniformly on any compact subset of (0 ,∞) asj→ ∞) = 1 for all z∈BR.
SinceZ∗has the same law as the part process of Zon [0,τBR), we have
Pz/parenleftBig
ϕj(Zt∧τBR)τBR−→0 uniformly on any compact subset of (0 ,∞) asj→ ∞/parenrightBig
= 1
for anyz∈Dand this holds for any ﬁxed R>0. On the other hand, for any bounded
continuous function FonRd,
Ez0/bracketleftbig
F(uz0,ri(Zt)τBR−)/bracketrightbig
=E0/bracketleftbig
F(u(z0+Zrα
it)τα,ri−)/bracketrightbig
→F(u(z0))
by the scale invariance and bounded convergence theorem, wh ere
τα,r= inf{s≥0|Zs/∈Brα
2R}.
This yields that the law of ϕ(Zt)τBR−concentrates at u(z0) for eacht>0. This implies that
ϕ(Z)τBRis constant along the path of ZBRalmost surely under P0since it is a c` adl` ag
process. Consequently, ϕ(Z) is constant P0-a.s. since we took an arbitrary R>0. Take any
continuous point z∈Rdofϕ. Then for any η>0, there exists δ>0 such that for all
w∈Bδ(z),|ϕ(z)−ϕ(w)|<η. On the other hand, since Zis irreducible,
P0({ω;Z(ω)∩Bδ(z)/\e}atio\slash=∅})>0. Thus by taking t>0 andωsuch that the path
t/mapsto→ϕ(Zt(ω)) is constant and Zt(ω)∈Bδ(z), we have
|ϕ(z)−ϕ(0)|=|ϕ(z)−ϕ(Zt(ω))|<η.
Thereforeϕ=ϕ(0) a.e. This implies uis continuous at z0by Assumption 4.7.
Example 4.13. In Case 2, a weakly harmonic map u∈ FD
loc(M) with/hatwideE(u)<∞satisfying
Assumption 4.7 is continuous at z0∈Dif and only if
lim
ε→0/integraldisplayt∧τD1
ε∧τD1/integraldisplay
Rm|u(Zs)−u(z)|2
|Zs−z|m+αdzds<∞,Pz0-a.s.
for a relatively compact open subset D1inDwithz0∈D1.
Remark 4.14. At the moment we do not know if the same argument holds or not fo r all
stationary harmonic maps since our proof of Proposition 4.1 1 relies on Assumption 4.7.
