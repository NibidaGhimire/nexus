Abstract
We construct a one-parameter family of half-BPS solutions of type IIB supergravity using a consistent truncation
to gauged five-dimensional supergravity. For small values of the parameter, the solution reduces to the linear
perturbation of AdS 5×S5dual to the chiral primary operator in the stress-tensor multiplet, and we give
evidence that the geometry is regular and asymptotes AdS in a normalisable way for arbitrarily large values of
the parameter. We conjecture that the solution is the gravity dual of a “heavy” multi-trace operator in N= 4
SU(N) Super Yang-Mills made by pcopies of the stress-tensor chiral primary operator, with pof order N2in
the large Nlimit. We perform some holographic checks supporting this duality map.

The states of a holographic CFT admit a gravitational description whose qualitative nature depends on
how large the conformal dimension, ∆, is. In the classical limit of large central charge, c, the simplest
and best understood regime is that of a finite conformal dimension that does not scale with c. Such
“light” states are dual to supergravity fluctuations around the AdS vacuum if they are supersymmetric,
or, more generally, to string excitations. At the opposite end1are “heavy” states whose conformal
dimension grows like cwhen c→ ∞ , which, in the limit of large ’t Hooft coupling, are described by
non-linear solutions of supergravity that are regular, horizonless and asymptote AdS at large distances.
One of the reasons why this class of heavy states is interesting is because they can be identified with
the microstates of black holes, at least in those cases in which their degeneracy grows sufficiently fast
with their charges, which typically happens if they do not preserve too many supercharges. In more
supersymmetric cases, the ensemble of heavy states – but not the individual pure states – is usually
described by a singular supergravity solution which can be interpreted as a degenerate black hole with
vanishing horizon area (examples of such singular solutions are the two-charge susy black hole [1] and
the half-BPS superstar [2]). It is the interest in black holes that has motivated most of the efforts in
constructing the map between heavy states and regular supergravity solutions, generally quite a difficult
task.
In this endeavour, the most developed subfield is the supergravity construction of the microstates
of the Strominger-Vafa black hole [3]. If one restricts to the near-horizon region dual to a decoupled
CFT, these microstates are represented by asymptotically AdS 3×S3× M geometries, with Ma 4D
compact Ricci flat space, which usually plays only a spectator role. Not surprisingly, the first super-
gravity solutions to be found have been the ones with the most supersymmetries: the Lunin-Mathur
geometries [4,5] dual to half-BPS heavy states preserving 16 superconformal charges in the decoupling
limit and representing the microstates of the “small” two-charge black hole. Studying the action on these
geometries of the symmetries generating the CFT chiral algebra has lead to the construction of some of
the quarter-BPS microstates of the Strominger-Vafa black hole [6–11] (also known as superstrata [12])
and also of some non-supersymmetric states [13–15]. Despite being associated with the degenerate limit
of a black hole, already the half-BPS solutions have contributed significant insights to holography. By
using as probes the protected expectation values of light chiral primary operators (CPO’s) in the heavy
half-BPS states, one has formulated an impressively detailed map between CFT and gravity [16–19];
moreover, from the study of the linear fluctuations around the microstate geometries, one has derived
1Intermediate regimes include states with ∆ ∼c1/4, corresponding to strings in the pp-wave background, and wrapped
D-branes or giant gravitons, which provide the dual description of states with ∆ ∼c1/2.
1the strong coupling limit of the heavy-heavy-light-light (HHLL) correlator [20, 21], together with its
light-light-light-light (LLLL) limits, including both single and multi-trace operators [22–25].
Some of the progress in this AdS 3holographic context has been hampered by the complexity of the
CFT dual to the Strominger-Vafa black hole, the so called D1-D5 CFT. Already in the free limit, in
which the CFT reduces to an orbifold sigma-model, field theory calculations hinge on some non-trivial
technology [26, 27], but the real stumbling block is the extension to the interacting theory, which is
necessary to make contact with the gravity regime. At a generic point in its moduli space, the D1-D5
CFT does not have a known lagrangian description and computations can be done only perturbatively
close to the free point by means of conformal perturbation theory (see for example [28]).
In this respect, a more convenient holographic model is represented by N= 4SU(N) Super Yang-
Mills (SYM), whose states are dual to asymptotically AdS 5×S5geometries. Despite this being probably
the best studied interacting field theory, our supergravity understanding of its heavy states is surpris-
ingly quite undeveloped and essentially2limited to the most supersymmetric, i.e. half-BPS, states,
whose dual geometries have been known for quite some time [30]. These solutions, known as LLM
geometries, are completely encoded in a droplet configuration drawn on a plane, which determines, via
an integral formula, all the geometric data. Though the general integral expression allows to establish
some important properties of the geometries, like their regularity or their asymptotic behaviour and
global conserved charges, for a more detailed holographic analysis it is often useful to know the solution
explicitly, i.e. to compute the integrals associated to some droplet configuration. Beside the simplest
case of a circular droplet, which corresponds to the pure AdS 5×S5vacuum, this is a difficult, or out-
right unfeasible, task for more generic droplets. For this reason most studies of the LLM geometries
has focused on configurations with an extra U(1) symmetry, like a central disk droplet with concentric
rings.
In the present article we would like to revisit the supergravity description of half-BPS states of N= 4
SYM for several reasons. Firstly, the map between LLM geometries and half-BPS operators is natural in
the fermionic description of the latter [31,32]: the fermions correspond to the eigenvalues of the NbyN
matrix that makes up the operators and the droplet that encodes the geometry describes the phase-space
distribution of the fermions. Some holographic computations are however more naturally expressed in
the multi-trace representations of the supersymmetric operators, where one expresses the heavy operators
as the product of a large number (of order N2) of light multi-tsingle-trace CPO’s. We focus here on
the simplest such multi-traces formed by p∼N2copies of identical single-trace constituents, and in
particular we consider as elementary constituent the lightest CPO, that of dimension ∆ = 2. We
2Some results on 1/4 and 1/8 BPS microstate geometries have been obtained; see for example [29], for a very recent
development, and the references therein for earlier attempts.
2might refer to this class of operators as monochromatic multi-traces. It would be helpful to know the
supergravity duals of these operators: this question, for example, was recently asked in [33], since the
knowledge of these geometries would allow, among other things, the holographic computation of the
associated HHLL correlators and the comparison with the results obtained by other methods – we have
in mind, for example, the recent progress in the computation of integrated N= 4 correlators with heavy
states [34,35].
Within the LLM framework, the problem is to identify the droplet configuration dual to the
monochromatic operators. Since the R-charge carried by these operators breaks the extra U(1) sym-
metry, it is clear that the relevant geometry does not fall into the class of the much studied concentric
rings. In the regime in which p/N2is small, and thus the multi-trace approximates a light CPO, the
answer to this question was already contained in the original work of LLM [30], where it was suggested
that the relevant phase-space configuration is a fluctuation of the circular droplet whose wavelength is
related with the dimension of the light operator. This expectation was verified in [36] by showing that
at linear order in p/N2the LLM geometry following from the above deformed droplet is diffeomorphic
to the linear deformation of AdS 5×S5dual to the light CPO [37]. Our concern here is the non-linear
extension of this solution. A natural conjecture would be that monochromatic multi-traces are dual to
monochromatic ripple deformations of the disk, i.e. to droplets whose boundary is described in polar
coordinates by a curve of the form
r(ϕ) = 1 + αcos(kϕ), (1.1)
where kis the dimension of the elementary constituent of the heavy operator and αcontrols the number
of traces, p/N2. The results of the holographic analysis of the latter LLM solution, which was performed
in [38] at finite α, indicate, however, that this conjecture does not pass a basic consistency check, which
has been previously used and tested in the AdS 3context in [15]. It was indeed found in [38] that
the single-particle neutral CPO of dimension ∆ = 4 has a non-vanishing expectation value in the
LLM geometry associated with the monochromatic droplet (1.1). This leads to an inconsistency for
k= 2 because, as we will explain in more detail in Section 2.2, if the LLM geometry were dual to the
monochromatic multi-trace, it would imply that the extremal 3-point correlator containing the dimension
4 CPO and two of the dimension 2 constituents of the multi-trace does not vanish, contradicting the
general rule that holographic extremal correlators should vanish. This argument suggests that the multi-
trace dual to the LLM geometry (1.1) for k= 2 contains also single-trace constituents of dimension 4
and, conversely, that to construct the geometric duals to monochromatic multi-traces one should add
further harmonics to the profile (1.1) at higher orders in α. Moreover, even if we knew the proper
generalisation of (1.1), it would probably be unfeasible to compute the integrals necessary to express
the LLM solution in closed form for finite α.
3To get around these difficulties, we have sought inspiration in the AdS 3context and in particular
in the constructions based on a consistent truncation of the 6D supergravity on AdS 3×S3down to
a 3D gauged supergravity with asymptotically AdS 3solutions [39, 40, 13, 41, 14, 42, 15]. Working in a
truncation limits the degrees of freedom to the lowest harmonics on S3but it has the advantage –
crucial for our problem – to restrict the ambiguities one encounters in constructing a solution of the
supergravity equations that extends a given linearised solution. The intuitive idea is that the non-linear
solution that fits the truncation and reduces at linear order to the perturbation dual to a given CPO
describes precisely the monochromatic multi-trace constructed out of the CPO. We will show in the
following that a 5D consistent truncation can effectively be used also to construct geometries dual to
N= 4 SYM heavy states. The AdS 5context is even simpler than the AdS 3one because, while in this
latter case the truncation preserves degrees of freedom from both the gravity and the tensor multiplets
and this leaves some ambiguity in the solution of the 3D supersymmetric equations, the supergravity
multiplet exhausts all the content of the AdS 5×S5theory and, hence, the truncation we will use allows
no ambiguity when solving the equations.
After restating in more quantitative terms our problem and goals in Section 2, Section 3 describes
the 5D truncation in which we will construct our solution: it is a subtruncation of the SO(6) super-
gravity found in [43] that is tailored to have the symmetries implied by the monochromatic multi-trace
constructed out of the lowest CPO of N= 4 SYM (of dimension ∆ = 2). In Section 4 we start from the
linearised solution of the equations of motion dual to this CPO and we construct in perturbation theory
its non-linear extension. In CFT terms, the perturbation parameter controls the ratio between the num-
ber of traces in the heavy state and the central charge, p/N2. We find that, at all perturbative orders,
there is a unique solution that is regular and normalisable or, more precisely, has the asymptotic limit
appropriate to describe a state of the CFT without any relevant or irrelevant source. The structure of
the perturbative solution is closely analogous to that found in the AdS 3context. For larger values of the
perturbation parameter, however, we expect a qualitative difference. In AdS 3the infinite-dimensional
2D chiral algebra implies a “stringy exclusion principle” [44, 45] which puts an upper bound on the
admissible values of p; on the gravity side, violating this bound causes the emergence of closed time-like
curves. No such bound exist in AdS 5, where the superconformal algebra is finite-dimensional, and thus
we expect to find regular solutions for arbitrary, unbounded values of p/N2. To verify this expectation
it is necessary to go beyond perturbation theory, which we do in Section 5 by taking advantage of the
constraints implied by supersymmetry. We construct an exact solution expressed in terms of one func-
tion of one variable which, however, we can only define implicitly as the solution of a transcendental
equation. To gain some intuition on the solution, we study some of its limits, both as a function of p/N2
and of the radial coordinate, in Section 6. All evidence supports the existence of a proper geometry
for arbitrarily large p/N2. In Section 7 we perform a preliminary holographic study of our solution and
4compute its energy and R-charge and the expectation values of the CPO’s of dimension 2 and 4 – for
this purpose we apply the gauge-invariant formalism in [38]. The main outcome of this study is that it
provides a first non-trivial check that our solution is dual to the monochromatic multi-trace operator
we are after. Indeed, contrary to the LLM geometry with profile (1.1), in our solution the expectation
value of the neutral CPO of dimension 4 vanishes, as dictated by the vanishing of the extremal 3-point
coupling. The concluding Section 8 contains a summary of our main results and some comments on
possible developments, including the significance of our geometry for the understanding of the black hole
microstates. Some details of the computations are provided in the Appendix: the equations of motion
of the 5D truncation are listed in Appendix A and the holographic derivation of the R-charge and the
CPO expectation values are described in Appendix B.
2 The problem
In this section we provide some background material that helps to set the problem. We first review the
linear perturbation of AdS 5×S5[37] that is dual to a single-trace chiral primary operator of N= 4
SYM and we recall [36] that this solution can be mapped to the LLM geometry [30] associated with a
ripple deformation of the circular droplet, at first order in the deformation. We explain why it is not
obvious to identify the non-linear completion of the LLM solution that is dual to the simplest multi-trace
operator formed by multiple copies of identical single-trace constituents.
2.1 Light 1/2 BPS states and linearised deformations
In the N= 4SU(N) gauge theory, the 1/2 BPS single-trace operators of dimension ∆ = ksit in the
[0, k,0] R-symmetry multiplet of
Ok= TrZk, (2.1)
where Z= Φ1+iΦ2is a complex combination of the adjoint scalars ΦI(I= 1, . . . , 6). The gravity
duals of these operators3are the linearised deformations of AdS 5×S5found in [37]: if we denote by ¯ gµν
(µ, ν= 0, . . . , 4) and ¯ gαβ(α, β= 1, . . . , 5) the undeformed AdS 5andS5metrics and by hµνandhαβthe
3More precisely, the CFT expression (2.1) is only correct at leading order in 1 /N: for k≥4Okshould include
appropriate multi-trace corrections in order to be dual to a single-particle excitation in gravity [46]. These corrections
guarantee the orthogonality between single and multi-particle operators. In the following the operators Okwill always
denote the properly defined single-particle operators, even if we will use single-trace and single-particle interchangeably.
5respective deformations, one has4
hµν=−ϵ3
4(k+ 1)[2∇µ∇νbk−k(k−1)¯gµνbk]Yk, h αβ=−ϵ3
4k¯gαβbkYk; (2.2)
here ϵis the perturbative parameter, in which we expand at first order in this analysis, ∇µis the
covariant derivative with respect to the unperturbed AdS 5metric, and bkandYkare eigenfunctions of
the AdS 5andS5laplacians
2AdS 5bk=k(k−4)bk,2S5Yk=−k(k+ 4)Yk. (2.3)
If we introduce the following parametrisations for AdS 5andS5:
d¯sAdS 5=dρ2−cosh2ρ dτ2+ sinh2ρ dΩ2
3, d¯sS5=dθ2+ cos2θ d˜ϕ2+ sin2θ d˜Ω2
3, (2.4)
then we can take
bk= cosh−kρ eikτ, Y k= coskθ eik˜ϕ. (2.5)
We see that the solution only depends on ϕ≡˜ϕ+τand its isometry group is SO(4)×SO(4)×R,
corresponding to rotations on the two S3’s, Ω 3and˜Ω3, and to τtranslations at fixed ϕ. Note that with
the choice (2.5) the metric perturbation in (2.2) is complex, but when we will consider the non-linear
extension of the solution, we will always implicitly assume to take the real part of the linearised solution.
With this understanding, the solution acquires a further Z2symmetry that acts on the coordinates
introduced above as ( τ, ϕ)→ −(τ, ϕ); this extra symmetry will play a role in the following.
The solution also requires a deformation of the RR 4-form, δC4:
δC4=3

with ¯⋆AdS 5,¯⋆S5the Hodge duals defined with respect to the unperturbed metrics, though we will mostly
focus on the metric deformation in the following.
The most general half-BPS solution of type IIB supergravity with isometry SO(4)×SO(4)×Rwas
found in [30], and it is uniquely specified by a droplet configuration in a two-dimensional plane. Hence
the linearised solution described here must be a limit of some LLM solution. One can indeed verify [36]
that the LLM geometry associated with a deformed disk droplet, whose boundary is the wavy curve
r(ϕ) = 1−ϵ
2cos(kϕ), (2.7)
is diffeomorphic to the geometry in (2.2) at first order in ϵ.
4The awkward normalisation is chosen for later convenience.
62.2 The search for heavy states
We are interested in 1/2 BPS heavy states in the classical supergravity limit, defined by taking
c=N2
4≫1,∆≫1,∆
N2fixed . (2.8)
On the CFT side one can construct such states by taking multi-traces of the light CPO’s introduced
above
Ok,p= (Tr Zk)p, (2.9)
with kfinite and p∼N2. We are thus working in a double-scaling limit of large charge pand large N,
with fixed p/N2. Note that for D= 4 superconformal theories there is no upper bound on p: this is
an important qualitative difference with respect to the D= 2 theories, where the infinite-dimensional
superconformal algebra implies a “stringy exclusion bound” on pof order c[45]. Moreover, since we are
taking N≫k, we can discard the trace identities that would otherwise relate operators with different
values of kandN.
The goal of this article is to find the supergravity description of the states Ok,pin the classical heavy
limit (2.8). As explained in [47, 38], the states that admit a classical supergravity dual are actually
coherent state superpositions of the states Ok,p, centered over some average value of pbut with a
non-vanishing spread over a finite range of p’s. One should thus consider states of the form
Ok,ϵ=∞X
p=0cp(k, ϵ)Ok,p, (2.10)
where ϵis the continuous parameter characterising the coherent state, that should be identified with the
ϵappearing in (2.2), and the precise form of the coefficients cp(k, ϵ) for the heavy state we are after is
currently unknown to us (for the LLM state with profile (2.7), see eq. (6.30) of [38]). In the classical
heavy limit (2.8), the above sum over ppeaks over a central value ¯ pdetermined by ϵ, and one expects
that ¯p/N2increases with ϵ. For most purposes in this article, like the computation of simple observables
that do not mix different values of p(as the energy or the R-charge) we can ignore this complication and
assume the simple form for the heavy operators given in (2.9), with the understanding that it represents
only the leading term in a coherent state superposition. More complicated observables are sensitive to
thep-spread, and we will also consider some such observables in the following.
As a starting point for the construction of the bulk dual of Ok,ϵ, one could consider the limit where
¯p/N2is made small and formally taken to zero; then the heavy operator Ok,ϵeffectively becomes light
and it should approximate the single-trace CPO Ok. That this light limit is continuous is not obvious,
but this is what was found in the study of asymptotically AdS 3heavy states – see for example [25],
7where the continuity of the light limit was used to deduce LLLL correlators from HHLL ones – and we
will assume the same is true for AdS 5. Under this hypothesis, the geometry dual to Ok,ϵshould reduce
to the deformation of AdS 5×S5given (2.2) in the limit ¯ p/N2→0, which, as explained above, should
be equivalent to sending ϵ→0. Our problem then reduces to finding a non-linear completion of the
geometry in (2.2) that solves the supergravity equations exactly in ϵ. With only this input the solution
is highly non-unique, since when one solves iteratively the supergravity equations order by order in ϵ
starting from (2.2), one has the freedom to add homogeneous solutions that are not completely fixed
even by requiring the regularity of the geometry. The same problem is manifest in the LLM picture,
where there are clearly infinitely many choices of droplets that reduce to (2.7) at linear order in ϵ.
One could nevertheless invoke simplicity and argue that the droplet in (2.7) gives the correct bulk
dual to Ok,ϵeven for finite ϵ. With this assumption, one can derive the relation between ϵand ¯p/N2
by matching the R-charge of Ok,ϵ,k¯p, with the one extracted from the asymptotic limit of the LLM
geometry defined by the droplet (2.7): this computation was done in [38] with the result that ϵ2∼¯p
k N2.
This fact raises a puzzle: as we remarked above, on the CFT there is no upper bound on p, and thus,
according to the previous identification between ¯ pandϵ, there should be no upper bound on ϵeither;
on the other hand it is clear from (2.7) that when ϵ≥2 the droplet degenerates and hence even the
bulk dual should develop some pathology. This is hard to verify explicitly because the integrals needed
to write down the LLM metric are difficult to compute in closed form for finite ϵfor the profile (2.7).
Further evidence against the holographic identification between (2.7) and Ok,ϵcomes from the com-
putation [38] of the expectation value in the state dual to (2.7) of the operator O4,0, the descendant of
the CPO O4with vanishing R-charge. Assuming the form (2.10) for the dual state, the non-trivial part
of this expectation value is captured by the 3-point function ⟨¯O2O4,0O2⟩, where O2(¯O2) is coming from
the ket |Ok,ϵ⟩(the bra ⟨Ok,ϵ|). When k= 2 this is an extremal 3-point function and thus the expectation
value should vanish. Note that the same general criterion has already been tested for asymptotically
AdS 3geometries in [15], where it has provided a consistent interpretation of the so called “special locus”
solution found in [13] by working in a consistent 3D truncation. Using holographic renormalisation
techniques, the authors of [38] have extracted the expectation value of O4,0from the LLM geometry
with profile (2.7) and found a non-vanishing result for any k, thus contradicting this general criterion.
In view of these difficulties, we will follow a different strategy, that has proved to be useful in the AdS 3
context for both BPS and non-BPS states [39,40,13,41,14,42,15]. We will work in an effective 5D theory
obtained by truncating the 10D space to the lowest S5harmonics and we will solve the supergravity
equations of the truncated theory exactly in ϵwith the requirement that the solution reduces to (2.2)
at linear order in ϵ. We will see that in this restricted setting there is a unique regular and normalisable
solution and we will assume that this solution gives the bulk dual of the heavy state Ok,ϵfork= 2. We
8will provide a non-trivial test of this assumption by showing that the expectation values of O4and its
uncharged descendant O4,0, extracted from our geometry with the holographic tools of [38], are zero, as
required by the vanishing of the extremal 3-point functions.
One obvious limitation of this approach is that the truncated theory only captures the lowest KK
harmonics and thus it can only be used to describe the multi-trace operator O2,ϵbuilt with multiple
copies of the CPO O2, which is the bottom component of the stress-tensor multiplet of the 5D gauged
supergravity.
We will describe the 5D consistent truncation that fits our purposes in the next section.
3 The 5D truncation
The reduction of type IIB supergravity on S5leads to the N= 8 5D gauged supergravity that was first
found in [48,49]. This theory contains a fairly large number of scalars, 42, together with 15 gauge fields
and 12 two-form gauge potentials. Since the elementary constituents, O2, of our heavy state sit in the
20′scalar representation of SO(6), and this is the only field that is excited at order ϵ, it is natural to look
for a smaller effective theory whose scalar content is restricted to the 20′. It was indeed shown in [43]
that such a consistent truncation exists and it contains, apart from the 20′scalars, also the 15 gauge
fields and, of course, the 5D metric. Moreover [43] also provides the 10D uplift of the 5D theory, where
only the 10D metric and the self-dual five-form are excited. Thus this consistent truncation appears to
contain precisely the field content we need. We can actually further simplify the truncation by using
theSO(4)×SO(4)×R×Z2symmetry that we have found in the linear solution and that should be
preserved at all order in ϵ. Of course, imposing a symmetry guarantees the consistency of this further
truncation.
We will now describe the field content of the supergravity theory we will be working with. We will for
the moment concentrate on the 10D metric, but we will also write down the five-form when discussing
the supersymmetry. The general form of the 10D metric for the truncation of [43] is

form of these geometric data to the following ansatz:

traded the coordinate ρused in (2.4) for ξ= tanh ρin such a way that asymptotic infinity ρ→ ∞ is
mapped to the finite point ξ= 1; we have also fixed the reparametrization invariance related to the
radial coordinate by choosing a particular ratio between the ( ξξ) and the Ω 3components of the 5D

µ1+i µ2= cos θ eiϕ, µI= sin θˆxIfor I= 3, . . . , 6 with ˆ xIˆxI= 1, (3.3)
we can make explicit the form of the 10D metric for our truncation:

The AdS 5×S5vacuum is obtained by setting Ω 0= Ω 1= 1, λ=µ= Φ = 0; note that the presence
of the constant 1 in the gauge field A12in (3.2c) is due to the fact that the S5coordinate defining the
vacuum is ˜ϕ=ϕ−τ: this is the coordinate that should be used to read off, for example, the R-charge of
the state. However working with the coordinate ϕhas the advantage of cancelling all the τdependence
from the geometry, making the Risometry manifest.
As a first non-trivial test, one should check that the linear perturbation (2.2) fits in the above
truncation for k= 2. This is not manifest in the form (2.2), where the perturbation contains non-
diagonal terms in the AdS 5part, while in the metric (3.4a) it is the S5part that is non-diagonal. This
apparent discrepancy is resolved by applying to (2.2) the linearised diffeomorphism generated by the
vector field ξM(M≡ {µ, α}), with

One can now check that the real part of the perturbation ( h′

Ω0= Ω 1= 1 , µ = Φ = 0 , λ =ϵ(1−ξ2), (3.7)

We have thus learnt that the lightest CPO O2is described within the truncation (3.4) by a small
perturbation of the field λ. Our next task is to complete this linear solution to an exact non-linear
solution of the equations of motion, that is dual to a heavy operator that we conjecture to be the
multi-trace O2,ϵ.
4 Perturbative solution of the equations of motion
In this Section we will solve the equations of motion of our truncation perturbatively in the parameter
ϵand we will show that there is a unique normalisable solution that reduces to (3.7) at first order in ϵ.
The equations of motion for the truncation (3.4) can be derived from the lagrangian

where gµνstands for the 5D base metric ds2
5(3.2a) and F12=dA12=∂ξΦdξ∧dτ.
The equations are written in full in the Appendix (see (A.1)). They consist of five second order
ordinary differential equations for the five unknowns, Ψ ≡(λ, µ,Φ,Ω0,Ω1), plus one first order constraint,
(A.1f), that originates from having gauge-fixed the diffeomorphism invariance of the 5D metric ds2
5. One
can check that the constraint is consistent with the remaining equations by taking its ξ-derivative,
replacing the second derivatives using the other equations and verifying that one obtains an identity.
The equations are coupled and non-linear and it is thus hard to envisage a method to solve them
exactly, in general. In the next Section, we will eventually construct an exact solution, though expressed
in a somewhat implicit form, by leveraging the constraints implied by supersymmetry. It is however
useful to start from a more direct perturbative approach, starting from the first order solution (3.7) dual
11toO2. We thus assume the following ϵexpansion for the fields
λ=X
n=0λ(2n+1)ϵ2n+1, µ =X
n=1µ(2n)ϵ2n,Φ =X
n=1Φ(2n)ϵ2n,Ωi= 1 +X
n=1ω(2n)
iϵ2n(i= 0,1),
(4.2)
with the input
λ(1)= 1−ξ2. (4.3)
The equation for the generic field Ψ at order ϵnforn >1 has the form
∇2Ψ(n)=Sn[Ψ(m)], (4.4)
where ∇2is the second order wave operator defined in (A.2) and the source Sn[Ψ(m)] is a function of the
fields and their first derivatives of order m≤n−1. The equations can thus be solved iteratively5order
by order in ϵby simply inverting the wave operator ∇2. The existence and uniqueness of the perturbative
solution thus rests on the invertibility of the operator ∇2restricted to the space of fields with specific
boundary conditions. The equations of motion have an obvious invariance under the constant rescaling
Ω1→cΩ1, 1 + Φ →c(1 + Φ), which corresponds to a rescaling of the time coordinate τ→c τ: we
will fix this arbitrariness by the asymptotic boundary condition Ω 1(ξ= 1) = 1. Moreover, at every
perturbative order one has the freedom to shift Φ →Φ +c′, which is equivalent to modify the constant
1 that we introduced in A12
τ. One sees, however, that the constant in Φ(n)determines the existence
of a normalisable solution for λ(n+1)and it turns out, quite non-trivially, that the normalisability and
regularity of λrequires setting to zero this constant at every perturbative order, in such a way that the
boundary condition Φ( ξ= 1) = 0 remains undeformed for generic ϵ. The requirement that the solution
asymptotes to AdS 5×S5imposes that λ(ξ= 1) = µ(ξ= 1) = 0 and Ω 0(ξ= 1) = 1. We will ask for the
more stringent condition that the asymptotic decay of the fields is normalisable in the AdS/CFT sense,
i.e. that their behaviour at infinity is that associated with a VEV (the expectation value of the field)
rather than with a source. For example a field of dimension two, like λ, should decay like 1 −ξ2but
not like (1 −ξ2) log(1 −ξ2). And we will require all the fields to be regular in the whole allowed range
ofξ, 0≤ξ≤1. One can easily verify that the only field for which there exist regular and normalisable
solutions, in the sense explained above, of the homogeneous wave equation, ∇2Ψ = 0, is λ, whose
homogeneous solution is the linear order deformation λ(1)= 1−ξ2. Consider, for example, the field µ,
which is dual to the R-symmetry descendant of O2with vanishing R-charge, whose associated spherical
harmonic is Y2,0∼3 sin2θ−2: the only regular solution of the equation ∇2µ= 0 (A.2b) behaves at
5The source for the field ω(n)
1actually depends also on ω(n)

0and then use the solution in the

12infinity like a source, and we will impose the absence of such terms at every perturbative order. The
asymmetry between λandµis clearly due to the fact that, when reducing from (3.1) to (3.4), we have
broken SO(6) down to SO(4). In other words, in the minimal truncation (3.4) the only field6for which
we can freely turn on a VEV is the one dual to O2; the VEVs of all other fields are determined by the
non-linear backreaction in terms of this primary VEV. This observation has the important mathematical
consequence that at every order in ϵthe solution of the equations (4.4) is unique.7The existence of
a solution Ψ(n), fulfilling the regularity and asymptotic conditions, is instead highly non-obvious, a
priori. It is computationally quite easy to push the iterative solution of the equations to relatively high
perturbative order (we have reached order ϵ21) and we have gathered a convincing empirical evidence
that the solution exists for arbitrary nand it has the form of a polynomial in ξ.
To summarise, there exists a unique, regular and normalisable perturbative solution of the equations
of motion, that reduces to the solution for the CPO O2, (4.3), at O(ϵ). At order ϵnthe field Ψ(n), with
Ψ(n)any of the fields λ(n),µ(n), Φ(n),ω(n)
idefined in (4.2), has the form
Ψ(n)= (1−ξ2)˜Ψ(n), (4.5)
where ˜Ψ(n)is a polynomial in ξ2of degree growing like 2 n. We give these polynomials up to order ϵ5:
˜µ(2)=1

It is interesting to compare the above perturbative solution with the LLM geometry with the profile
(2.7), which can be constructed explicitly by performing the necessary integrals order by order in ϵ.
One can check that the two solutions differ already at order ϵ2and that the LLM droplet needed to
reproduce (4.6)-(4.7) at that order is instead
r(ϕ) = 1−ϵ
2cos(2 ϕ) +3
16ϵ2cos(4 ϕ) +O(ϵ3). (4.8)
6This is different from the truncation used in the AdS 3context [39,40] where, for supersymmetric solutions, one could
freely choose the VEVs of two fields, dual to operators of dimension one and two. Indeed the 6D supergravity whose
reduction gives rise to the AdS 3theory contains both a gravity and several tensor multiplets and the two independent
fields that survive the truncation are the lowest dimension members of a tensor multiplet and of the gravity multiplet.
The field content of the AdS 5theory is, on the other hand, fully contained in the gravity multiplet. In this sense, the
solution we construct here should be thought as the analogue of the “purely NS superstratum” of [41,42], where only the
VEV of the dimension two field is turned on.
7Adding an arbitrary homogeneous solution for λ(n)just amounts to redefine the parameter ϵand we will arbitrarily
fix this freedom.
13This suggests that the multi-trace operator formed only by powers of O2is dual to an LLM geome-
try generated by a complicated droplet, containing an infinite series of harmonics, cos( kϕ), and that,
conversely, the simple profile (2.7) maps to a multi-trace that involves several CPO’s, Okwith k≥2.
5 Supersymmetry and the exact solution
The perturbative approach of the previous Section gives persuasive evidence of the existence and unique-
ness of a solution with the properties expected for the bulk dual of O2,ϵ, and provides a constructive way
to determine the solution in the limit in which the CFT state reduces to a light multi-trace operator
formed by a finite number, ¯ p≪N2, of single-trace constituents; in this regime the geometry describes
a deformation around AdS 5×S5. To study the large charge (¯ p≳N2≫1) limit of the geometry one
needs, however, to go beyond the regime of small ϵ. It is natural to expect that to construct an exact
solution the simplifications implied by supersymmetry might be crucial. In the perturbative approach,
supersymmetry enters only through the first order input, (4.3), which describes the supersymmetric
single-trace O2. If our working assumption that the 1/2-BPS state O2,ϵis described within the mini-
mal truncation (3.4) is correct, the uniqueness of the perturbative solution implies, however, that the
geometry we have constructed in the previous section preserves 16 supercharges at all orders in ϵ. In
this Section, we will verify this expectation, thus lending further support to our assumption.
We will not attempt here a systematic analysis of the supersymmetry constraints in the truncation
(3.1), nor in its minimal version (3.4), and, to the best of our knowledge, such an analysis is not available
in the literature. We follow a somewhat brute-force route, which exploits some result of the Appendix
A of [30]. For this purpose, we quote their notation for the 10D metric, ds2
10, and the five-form, F5:

(5.4)
As a check of the above expressions one can verify the self-duality of F5, which translates into
˜F=−e−3G⋆4F , (5.5)
with ⋆4the Hodge dual associated with ds2
4.
It is shown in [30] (see Eq. (A.48)) that supersymmetry implies
d(e−(H+G))∧F+d(e−(H−G))∧˜F= 0. (5.6)
Note that the l.h.s. of this equation depends non-trivially on the S5coordinates and, hence, requiring
it to vanish identically in ( θ, ϕ) imposes strong constraints on our five unknown functions of ξ, though
it requires some effort and a certain amount of guessing to extract them. Even if there might be a more
systematic and efficient way to derive them, it turns out that these constraints are enough to allow for
an exact solution of our problem. We find that a set of sufficient conditions to satisfy the supersymmetry
requirement (5.6), together with the first order constraint (A.1f), are

1−ξ2.(5.7b)
The first set of constraints, (5.7a), are algebraic and allow to eliminate two of the unknowns, say Φ and
Ω0; the second set, (5.7b), are three first order differential relations for the remaining three unknowns.
One can check that (5.7a) and (5.7b) imply all the five second order equations of motion, (A.1a)-(A.1e),
vol(AdS 5) + vol( S5) in the AdS limit. We are choosing our orientation in such a way that
vol(AdS 5) =−ξ3
(1−ξ2)3dξ∧dτ∧dΩ3,vol(S5) = sin3θcosθ dθ∧dϕ∧d˜Ω3, (5.3)
to conform with the convention of [30].
15and thus they completely encapsulate our supergravity problem. We have also checked (up to order
ϵ21) that the perturbative solution constructed in the previous section satisfies (5.7a) and (5.7b), thus
verifying the expectation that the perturbative solution describes a supersymmetric state.
To recap, supersymmetry has significantly simplified the problem from the five second order equations
(A.1a)-(A.1e) to the three first order equations (5.7b) in the unknowns λ,µand Ω 1. These equations,
however, are still coupled and non-linear and some more effort is needed to reduce the system to
quadrature. A first useful observation is that the system (5.7b) has an integral of motion:
H ≡Ω2
1
1−ξ2e2µsinhλwith ∂ξH= 0. (5.8)
A priori, the constant value of Hshould be left arbitrary and determined at the end by the regularity
and normalizability of the solution. We find it more convenient to extrapolate the proper value from
the perturbative solution, which suggests to take:
H= sinh ϵ . (5.9)
Of course we will be able to confirm this guess a posteriori. With the new input, (5.9), the system
further reduces to two coupled first order equations for two unknowns, λandµ:
∂ξλ=2e−3µsinhϵ

(5.10)
One can derive µfrom the first equation and substitute it in the second to arrive at a non-linear second
order equation for λ, which can be recast in the form:
∂ξΞ = 0 with Ξ ≡ξ(1−ξ2)1
2(sinh λ)−3
2∂ξλ+ 2 (sinh ϵ)1
2cothλ . (5.11)
Thus, we finally arrive at a first order equation for λ: Ξ = const ., which can be solved by quadrature.
As before, the value of the constant could be determined a posteriori, but it is simpler to guess it from
the perturbative solution, obtaining:
Ξ = 2 (sinh ϵ)−1
2coshϵ . (5.12)

6 Limits of the exact solution
Since we cannot write λexplicitly, the best we can do to analyse the geometry is to consider various
limits where λadmits an expansion in terms of elementary functions. This will allow us to perform
some consistency and regularity checks on the exact solution we have just constructed. We will use the
asymptotic expansion of the geometry that we derive in this Section to carry out a holographic analysis
of the solution in the next Section.
The Appell function in (5.14) is a generalisation of the ordinary hypergeometric and it can be
expanded in terms of 2F1functions when one of its last two arguments, xory, goes to zero:
F1(a, b1, b2, c;x, y) =∞X
m=0(a)m(b1)m

. (6.2)
This observation makes some limits of the solution, as a function of either ϵorξ, accessible to an explicit
and analytical analysis. The variables that appear in the equation for λ(5.14) are
x=−sinh2λ , y =sinh2λ
sinh2ϵ, (6.3)
and their values control the different regimes. The easiest cases are when xory, or both, go to zero and,
hence, one can use the expansions (6.1) directly. This happens when ϵ→0, which is the perturbative
regime of Section 4, or when ξ→1, corresponding to the asymptotic region of the geometry. One
can also access the regimes where xorytend to the other two singular points of the hypergeometric
function, which are 1 and ∞. In these situations one can first take the limits of the 2F1functions using
the well-known hypergeometric connection formulas and then perform the sums over mornin (6.1).
This technique allows us to study the ξ→0 and ϵ→ ∞ limits.
6.1 ϵ→0
Consider first the perturbative regime of small ϵ. We know that when ϵ→0λ=O(ϵ) and thus x→0;
one can then use the first line of (6.1) together with (6.2) to expand the r.h.s. of (5.13) to any order in
ϵand reconstruct the perturbative expansion of λ. This provides a check of the consistency of the exact
solution with the one derived by the brute-force iterative solution of the equations of motion, given in
(4.6), (4.7) for the lowest orders. One can also verify that the perturbative solution satisfies the relations
(5.15) for the geometric functions other than λ.
6.2 ξ→1
The asymptotic expansion of the geometry near the AdS boundary is derived by taking ξ→1 keeping
ϵfinite. This limit is even simpler to compute, because one expects λ=O(1−ξ2) and thus both
the variables xandyare going to zero. Apart from confirming that the geometry has a well-behaved
asymptotic limit, this regime is physically interesting because it contains informations on the conserved
charges and other holographic VEV’s that will be computed in the next Section. After expanding the
18Appell function, the λequation (5.14) can be solved; this, together with (5.15), yields:

where we have kept the terms in the ξ→1 expansion that are needed to extract the VEV’s of operators
up to dimension 4.
One observes that the geometry has the allowed asymptotic limit – i.e. the large distance behaviour
expected for a non-trivial state in a CFT undeformed by external sources – for any finite value of ϵ,
supporting the belief that there is no upper bound on ϵ.
6.3 ξ→0
The absence of pathologies in the asymptotic region for any ϵdoes not exclude, of course, the possibility of
a singularity appearing somewhere in the bulk for sufficiently large values of ϵ. It is therefore interesting
to have analytical control over the behaviour of the geometry around the center of space, ξ≈0, away
from the perturbative regime of small ϵ. The perturbative computation indicates that λ(n)vanishes at
ξ= 0 for n >1 – we have checked that this true up to n= 21 – and thus suggests the ansatz
λ=ϵ−f(ϵ)ξ2+O(ξ4), (6.5)
for some function f(ϵ) that is determined by (5.14). With this assumption, y= 1−2 coth ϵ f(ϵ)ξ2+O(ξ4)
and thus we are led to study the behaviour of F1around the singular point y= 1. This can be done by
using the first line of (6.1), taking the y→1 limit of (6.2)

is a function that we have been unable to evaluate analytically but we believe it is finite for all positive

terms cancel, confirming the validity of the ansatz (6.5), and the finite terms determine f(ϵ)
f(ϵ) = tanh ϵ eπ
4−3
2log 2+2 g(ϵ). (6.9)
The necessary and sufficient condition for the regularity of the metric at ξ= 0 is that f(ϵ) be finite and
positive; indeed (5.15) implies that

0=(cosh ϵ)1
3
sinhϵf(ϵ) +O(ξ2), (6.10)
with all other metric functions finite, and thus if f(ϵ) were to vanish or become negative the metric
would be singular. Though we do not have a closed form expression for g(ϵ) and hence for f(ϵ), the
identity (6.9) shows that f(ϵ) is finite and positive as far as g(ϵ) stays finite; this is obviously true for
ϵ→0, where (6.8) implies g(ϵ)→ −π
8+3
4log 2 and thus f(ϵ)→ϵ, and also for ϵ→ ∞ , where f(ϵ)→eπ
2,
as we will show in the next subsection. This is a strong indication that no singularity develops near
ξ= 0 for any value of ϵ.
6.4 ϵ→ ∞
It is interesting to examine also the limit of large ϵwith fixed ξ. As we have already remarked, this
regime is not present in the AdS 3context and thus it has not yet been explored on the gravity side.
The previous analysis, in particular the ξ→0 limit, suggests that λdiverges when ϵ→ ∞ , and thus we
should look at the behaviour of F1forx→ −∞ , which is another singular point of the Appell function.
We will be able to confirm this working hypothesis a posteriori by verifying its consistency with (5.14).
To derive the x→ −∞ limit one can use the second line of (6.1) and the known connection formula for
the hypergeometric function

Using this limit in (5.14), one sees that a consistent ansatz when ϵ→ ∞ is
λ≈ϵ+ log h(ξ), (6.13)
where the function h(ξ) is defined implicitly by
arctanh [(1 −ξ2)1
2] = arctanh [ h(ξ)1
2] + arctan [ h(ξ)1
2]. (6.14)
In Figure 1 we have plotted this implicit function. The limits of h(ξ) for ξ→0 and ξ→1 are
h(ξ) = 1−eπ
2ξ2+O(ξ4), h(ξ) =1
4(1−ξ2) +O((1−ξ2)2). (6.15)
Comparing the ϵ→ ∞ ,ξ→0 result with (6.5) gives the large ϵlimit of the function f(ϵ)
f(ϵ)ϵ→∞→eπ
2, (6.16)
as we have anticipated in the previous subsection.
Note that the ϵ→ ∞ result (6.13) does not lead to an asymptotically AdS geometry. This is not
surprising, because taking ϵlarge with fixed ξexcludes the asymptotically AdS region, in which eϵ(1−ξ2)
should be taken small, as can be seen by taking ϵlarge in (6.4). It would be interesting to analyse further
the physical meaning of this large ϵregime.
7 Holographic analysis
The knowledge of the asymptotic limit of the geometry for arbitrary ϵ, (6.4), allows us to compute the
conserved charges and the expectation values of some CPO’s in the dual heavy state; we will dub, for
brevity, these expectation values as VEV’s, even if it should be kept in mind that they are computed in
a non-trivial state and not in the vacuum. These quantities are independent of the coupling constant
and thus provide a tool to infer the map between the CFT and the gravity parameters – in particular the
relation between ¯ p/N2andϵ– and also to gather the first non-trivial checks of this holographic map. The
basic idea behind these computations is simple and exploits the standard holographic relation between
the VEV of an operator of dimension ∆ and the term of order r−∆in the large rexpansion of the dual

supergravity field, where the radial coordinate, r, is related to our coordinate ξasr−2∼1−ξ2. However,
constructing the precise map between operators and supergravity fields in a coordinate independent way
requires a careful analysis that, luckily for us, has been performed in the AdS 5context in [38], whose
results we will heavily borrow in the following. We will report some of the most technical details of the
computation in Appendix B.
7.1 The conserved charges
We start by computing the energy, E, which follows from the holographic formula for the CFT stress
tensor Tµν[50]. Since the CFT lives on R×S3,Tµνhas a non-vanishing trace, proportional to the
curvature of S3; the trace of the stress-energy tensor gives rise to the non-vanishing vacuum (or Casimir)
energy. We will not be interested in this vacuum contribution to the energy, which is independent of
the state, and thus we will only focus on the traceless stress-energy tensor, that we denote by ˜Tµν. To
extract ˜Tµνfrom the geometry, one performs the usual Fefferman-Graham expansion of the 5D metric

which yields
˜Ttt=N2

2
. (7.5)
Then the energy above the vacuum is obtained by integrating ˜TttoverS3:
E= 2π2˜Ttt=N2sinh2ϵ
2
. (7.6)
Our state being supersymmetric, the energy Eshould equal the R-charge J. Verifying this equality is
a first consistency check of our construction.
The R-charge is extracted from the second order term in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the
gauge field Φ:
Φ = Φ(0)+z2Φ(2)+O(z4). (7.7)
Fixing the coefficient of proportionality between Φ(2)andJrequires a bit of work, and we leave the
details for the Appendix. The general relation is
J=−N2
2Φ(2), (7.8)
which, using (6.4), gives
J=N2sinh2ϵ
2
, (7.9)
thus confirming the supersymmetric nature of our solution.
9In general ˜Tµνalso contains terms that depend on g(2)
µν. For our solution however g(2)
µνis independent of ϵ:g(2)
tt=
g(2)
ii=−1
2, and thus these terms only contribute to the vacuum energy and we omit them.
23The expression for E=Jdetermines the relation between the supergravity parameter ϵand the
average number of single-trace components of the heavy state, ¯ p:

, (7.10)
since every single-trace operator O2carries E=J= 2.
7.2 Expectation values of CPO’s
More stringent checks on the identification of the geometry we have constructed with a state of the form
(2.10) can be obtained by looking at the expectation values in that state of the CPO’s Okor their SO(6)
descendants with R-charge I, that we denote by Ok,I(of course Ok=Ok,kand ¯Ok=Ok,−k). Only
operators that preserve the SO(4) rotation symmetry acting on the directions Φi, with i= 3, . . . , 6, can
have non-trivial expectation values in our state, and thus we can use the descent operator

with
JIJ≡ −i

I, J= 1, . . . , 6 (7.12)
theSO(6) generators, to generate Ok,I−2fromOk,I, up to a normalisation factor. The normalisation of
the single-particle operators Ok,Iis the one used in [38], according to which ⟨Ok,IOk,I⟩ ∼N2, while the
heavy state |O2,ϵ⟩has unit norm. We will denote the VEV of Ok,Iin the heavy state as
⟨Ok,I⟩ ≡ ⟨O 2,ϵ|Ok,I|O2,ϵ⟩. (7.13)
The lightest operator with a non-vanishing VEV is O2itself: acting on O2,p,O2produces O2,p+1and
since the coherent state O2,ϵcontains a sum over p,O2has a non-trivial expectation value which probes
thep-dependence of the coefficients cp(2, ϵ). The holographic recipe applied to our gravity solution
produces indeed a non-vanishing result
⟨O2⟩=−N2
2π211√
2
9sinhϵ , (7.14)
consistently with the CFT expectation. Note however that finding a non-vanishing ⟨O2⟩is not a mean-
ingful test of the non-linear completion of the supergravity solution: any solution that reduces at linear
order in ϵto the CPO deformation (2.2), including the LLM geometry with profile (2.7), produces a
result of the form of (7.14).
24A more interesting class of observables are the VEVs of the dimension four operators, ⟨O4,I⟩, with
I= 0,4. As already explained at the end of Section 2.2, the expectation value of O4,0is proportional
to the 3-point coupling ⟨¯O2O4,0O2⟩, and similarly that of O4is proportional to ⟨¯O2¯O2O4⟩(where now
both the ¯O2operators come from the bra ⟨Ok,ϵ|). Both the 3-point couplings above are extremal (the
dimension of one of the operators in the correlator equals the sum of the dimensions of the other two),
and hence they should vanish. One can explain the vanishing of the extremal couplings by the fact that
operators, like Ok,I, dual to single-particle supergravity states have to be defined to be orthogonal to
all multi-particle states (see for example [46]). This argument then leads to a sharp prediction
⟨O4⟩=⟨O4,0⟩= 0. (7.15)
We show in Appendix B that our supergravity solution fulfils this prediction and, moreover, the vanishing
of⟨O4,I⟩is the result of a quite non-trivial cancelation which is sensitive to the non-linear completion
of the geometry. As we already mentioned, the LLM profile (2.7) is, on the contrary, inconsistent with
(7.15). We should mention that a very similar holographic test has been performed in the AdS 3context
in [15] (see Section 4.4).
For completeness we should mention that also the VEV of O2,0is sensitive to the non-linear structure
of our solution, being proportional to ⟨¯O2O2,0O2⟩. The latter 3-point function is not extremal and does
not vanish, and indeed the holographic computation produces a non-trivial output:
⟨O2,0⟩=N2
2π244√
2
9√
3sinh2ϵ
2
. (7.16)
This result is consistent with the interpretation of the dual state as a coherent state of the general form
(2.10), which leads to the prediction
⟨O2,0⟩CFT=⟨¯O2O2,0O2⟩
⟨¯O2O2⟩¯p . (7.17)
With our normalisation conventions both ⟨¯O2O2,0O2⟩and⟨¯O2O2⟩are proportional to N2and thus,
using (7.10), we see that the CFT prediction (7.17) reproduces both the Nandϵdependence of the
gravity result (7.16); the comparison of the numerical coefficients requires a more careful treatment of
the operators normalisations, which we do not perform here.
Note that deriving a CFT prediction also for the expectation value ⟨O2⟩, (7.14), requires the knowl-
edge of the coefficients cp(2, ϵ) that appear in the definition of the coherent state (2.10). It would be
interesting to gather further inputs to help us formulate a guess for such coefficients, but we leave this
task for future studies.
258 Summary and Outlook
The main goal of this article has been to construct the supergravity dual of the half-BPS multi-trace
operator made by many copies of O2, the CPO in the stress-tensor multiplet of N= 4 SYM, in the large
charge regime in which the number of copies is of order N2in the N→ ∞ limit. By working in the 5D
consistent truncation singled out by the field content and the symmetries associated with the half-BPS
state, we have found an exact solution of the supergravity equations, given in (5.15), written in terms
of the function λ(ξ) defined by the transcendental equation (5.14). We have shown that the geometry
is regular, horizonless and asymptotes AdS 5in a normalisable way for arbitrary values of the R-charge.
We have performed the first holographic checks supporting the identification of the state dual to our
geometry with the “monochromatic” multi-trace composed of O2; in particular we have verified the
vanishing of the expectation value of the CPO of dimension 4, as required by the triviality of extremal
3-point correlators.
Some aspects of our analysis deserve further study. It would be interesting to find a more precise
characterisation of the heavy state dual to our geometry. We have conjectured that the state should
have the form of the coherent superposition given in (2.10), but the expression for the coefficients cpis
still unknown to us. The results of the holographic calculation described in Section 7 constrain these
coefficients and, hopefully, they will suggest a natural ansatz. Some potentially new insights might also
come from the study of the large ϵlimit of our solution, which we have just touched upon in Section 6.4.
This limit describes the very large charge regime, p≫N2, and it represents a novelty in the microstate
literature, since in AdS 3this regime was forbidden by the stringy exclusion principle.
More broadly, our result opens the possibility to extend to the AdS 5context the pletora of holographic
studies performed on AdS 3microstates, with the added bonus of having a much better understood CFT
dual. A first direction we intend to pursue is the study of the wave equation describing light supergravity
operators in the background provided by our solution. The asymptotic expansion of the solution of this
equation encodes the HHLL correlator in the supergravity limit, i.e. large Nand large ’t Hooft coupling.
On the other hand, given the form (2.10) of our heavy operator, the small ϵexpansion of the HHLL
correlator should yield correlators with multi-trace insertions, of the form ⟨O2O2O2,pO2,p⟩. Recent
developments [34, 33, 35] have allowed the computation of integrated versions of such correlators for
arbitrary Nand arbitrary ’t Hooft coupling and, although our supergravity limit could capture only a
small corner of those results, it could still provide a useful10consistency check.
Finally, we would like to comment on the relevance of our findings for understanding the microstates
of black holes. To find an asymptotically AdS 5supersymmetric black hole with a finite horizon in su-
10We thank R. Russo and C. Wen for preliminary useful discussions on this point.
26pergravity (known as the Gutowski-Reall black [51]) one needs an ensemble of 1/16 BPS states, and our
half-BPS solution is obviously quite far from that class of states. The development of the microstate
construction for the Strominger-Vafa black hole has, however, shown that the most supersymmetric
configurations are a useful, if not essential, starting point. Drawing inspiration from that body of work,
the natural next step would be to consider the action on our half-BPS geometry of the symmetry gener-
ators of the N= 4 theory – including Virasoro, R-charge and superconformal generators – embedding
the resulting solution in a more general ansatz and then using some inspired guessing to extend the
solutions of that ansatz to 1/16 BPS states that are not global descendants of half-BPS ones. The
states generated in this way are examples of “multi-graviton” states and represent the fraction of the
black hole ensemble accessible to classical supergravity. The formal analogy of the asymptotically AdS 5
microstate we have constructed with the AdS 3ones gives us hope that this general program could lead
to the construction of a superstratum-like family of microstates for the Gutowski-Reall black hole. It is
clear, looking at the symmetries preserved by 1/16 BPS states, that the restricted truncation used in
this article, (3.4), will not be able to accomodate states with that small amount of supersymmetry, but
hopefully the more general truncation of [43] will be enough to contain at least a subset of the states.
Leaving this program for the future, the best we can do now is to compare the half-BPS solution
we have constructed with the singular geometry representing the ensemble of half-BPS states. As we
have anticipated in the introduction, this is the so called superstar [2], whose geometry was first found
in [52,53] (see [54] for a nice review of the statistical interpretation of the superstar). The 10D metric
of the superstar can be written as

In spite of this observation, we could not find a regime of parameters, ϵandξ, in which our microstate
geometry reduces to the superstar. This does not contradict the expectation that the solution we have

constraints (5.7).

(8.1) arises from a coarse graining process over an ensemble of regular geometries, of which the one we
have constructed here represents a particular one-dimensional subfamily parametrised by ϵ. The fact
that under this coarse graining the function λ, which is odd under ϵ→ −ϵ, averages to zero, as implied
by (8.3), seems consistent with this interpretation.

B Holographic computations
Here we provide the derivation of the holographic results presented in Section 7 for the R-charge, (7.9),
and for the expectation values of the dimension two and four CPO’s, (7.14)-(7.16). The computations
are based on the gauge-invariant formalism developed in [38], which we summarise below to make the
presentation self-consistent.
29The holographic data are encoded in the asymptotic ( ξ→1) expansion of the solution, where the
geometry tends to AdS 5×S5plus a fluctuation; we denote by hMN, with M={µ, α}, the components
of the metric fluctuation and by f(5)the fluctuation of the five-form. For the expectation values of the
scalar CPO’s we only need the components of the metric and the 5-form along the S5, which can be
expanded in spherical harmonics as
h(αβ)=X

The round parenthesis ( αβ) denotes the symmetric traceless part and YI
k,YI
ka,YI
k(ab)are scalar, vector
and tensor harmonics of degree kwith Ilabelling the different harmonics in the same SO(6) multiplet.
The coefficients ϕ(I)
k(t),ϕ(I)
k(v),ϕ(I)
(s),π(I)
k,b(I)
k(s)are functions on AdS 5and their asymptotics at infinity
determine the VEV’s we are seeking to extract. In particular they can be taken to depend on the
Fefferman-Graham coordinate zand the leading term for z→0 goes like zkfor the coefficients of
spherical harmonics of order k. When we will use these coefficients in the following we will always
imply to have kept only these leading terms. Since we are interested in VEV’s of chiral primaries up
to dimension four, we can rely on the expansion of our solution (6.4) up the second order in (1 −ξ2),
which is related to zby (7.3).
The most direct way to extract ϕ(I)

k,IB(I)
k(v)µYI
k α+B(I)
k(s)µDαYI
k,
fαβγδµ =ϵαβγδϵX
k,IDµb(I)
k(s)DϵYI
k+ (Λ k(v)−4)b(I)
kµYI
k ϵ,(B.12)
31where Λ k(v)=−(k2+ 4k−1) is the eigenvalue of the laplacian for the vector harmonics. The only (unit
normalized ) vector spherical harmonic relevant for our purposes is
Y1=r
3
π3cos2θ d˜ϕ . (B.13)
From the components along this harmonic one can construct the gauge-invariant vector combination
a1τ=B1(v)τ−16b1τ, (B.14)
and compute the R-charge using
J=Z
S3Jτwith Jτ=−N2
4√
3π7/2a1τ. (B.15)
The leading terms of B1(v)τ,b1τgo like z2forz→0 so we can use the asymptotic expansion of our
solution (6.4) at the first order in (1 −ξ2). By projecting the fluctuations of our solution onto the vector
harmonic Y1we find
a1τ=−2√
3π3sinh2ϵ
2
⇒ J=N2sinh2ϵ
2
