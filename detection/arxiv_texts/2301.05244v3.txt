ABSTRACT
The distribution of mass in galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses is often modelled as an
elliptical power law plus ‘external shear’, which notionally accounts for neighbouring galaxies
and cosmic shear. We show that it does not. Except in a handful of rare systems, the best-fit
values of external shear do not correlate with independent measurements of shear: from weak
lensingin45HubbleSpaceTelescopeimages,orin50mockimagesoflenseswithcomplex
distributions of mass. Instead, the best-fit shear is aligned with the major or minor axis of 88%
oflensgalaxies;andtheamplitudeoftheexternalshearincreasesifthatgalaxyisdisky.We
conclude that ‘external shear’ attached to a power law model is not physically meaningful, but
afudgetocompensateforlackofmodelcomplexity.Sinceitbiasesothermodelparameters
thatareinterpretedasphysicallymeaningfulinseveralscienceanalyses(e.g.measuringgalaxy
evolution, dark matter physics or cosmological parameters), we recommend that future studies
of galaxy-scale strong lensing should employ more flexible mass models.
Key words: gravitational lensing: strong — galaxies: structure

cumulative deflection of light by all other gravitational potentials
along the line of sight. Indeed, the best-fit value of external shear
matched a model of the line of sight for three of six galaxy lenses
studiedbyWongetal.(2011).Subsequentpapershaveevenproposed

of the ‘cosmic’ shear along individual lines of sight (Birrer et al.
2017;Desprezetal.2018;Kuhnetal.2020;Fleuryetal.2021;Hogg
et al. 2022). However, the best-fit values of external shear did not
match the lines of sight to the three other galaxies studied by Wong
et al. (2011) — and, in general, best-fit values are much larger than
expected for both galaxy lenses (Keeton et al. 1997; Witt & Mao
1997; Hilbert et al. 2007; Suyu et al. 2010; Barrera et al. 2021) and
clusterlenses(Robertsonetal.2020;Limousinetal.2022).Using
mockobservations,Caoetal.(2022,hereafterC22)demonstrated
that the best-fit shear can be incorrect if the model of the mass
distribution is missing complexity.
In this paper we compare the external shear measured from

2 GRAVITATIONAL LENSING THEORY
Gravitational lensing describes the deflection of light rays from
distant sources, by matter along its path to an observer, through
angle 𝜶. This maps 2D coordinates of light on the distant source
plane 𝜷tocoordinateswheretheyareobservedontheforeground
image plane 𝜽=(𝜃1,𝜃2), via the lens equation
𝜷=𝜽−𝜶(𝜽). (1)
Ifthegravitationallensismuchthinnerthanitsangulardiameter
distance from the observer 𝐷l, its distribution of mass can be
treated as a 2D surface density projected along the line-of-sight
Σ(𝜽)=∫
𝜌(𝐷l𝜃1,𝐷l𝜃2,𝑧)𝑑𝑧. Following the notation of Narayan
& Bartelmann (1996), the deflection angle 𝜶=∇𝜓is the vector
gradient of a 2D lensing potential

and the shear changes its shape. Strictly, these quantities are only
observable in combination as ‘reduced shear’ 𝑔𝑖=𝛾𝑖/(1−𝜅).

is also possible to see multiple images of a single source, if more
than one solution exists with different 𝜶and𝜽. To reconstruct 𝜶(𝜽)
it is usual to note that

3 DATA
3.1 Mock lens galaxies
Weanalyseasetof50mocklensimages,representativeofdatafrom
the SLACS survey. They were generated by C22 for an investigation
into the systematic errors induced by the elliptical power-law model.
Wesummarisethesimulationprocedurebelow;adetaileddescription
can be found in Section 2.4 of that paper.
The surface mass density of the lens galaxy comprises two
components: a dark matter halo, parameterised by the spherical
generalised Navarro, Frenk & White (gNFW) profile (Navarro et al.
1997; Zhao 1996; Cappellari et al. 2013), plus visible stellar matter,
parameterised by a Multiple Gaussian Expansion (MGE; Cappellari
2002). The model parameters of the gNFW and MGE profiles of
each lens galaxy are set to the best-fit parameters from fits of these
distributions to SDSS-MaNGA stellar dynamics data, derived by Li
et al. (2019) using theJeans anisotropic model (JAM) method. The
position angle of each Gaussian component in the MGE is fixed,
however their axis ratios are free to vary, allowing for elliptical
gradients in the mass distribution.
The light distribution of the source galaxy is modelled by a
singleSérsicprofile(Graham&Driver2005)witheffectiveradius
𝑅eff=0.15′′,Sérsicindex 𝑛=1,andaxisratio 𝑞=0.7.Theposition
inthesourceplane (𝑥𝑠,𝑦𝑠)isdrawnfromaGaussiandistribution
withmean0′′andstandarddeviation0.1′′,andthepositionangle
is uniformly selected between 0◦−180◦. The light from the source
galaxy is ray-traced from the source plane at 𝑧=0.6to the image
plane through the lens equation (equation 1), to simulate its lensed
appearance. Further, to mimic observational effects, the image is
convolved with a Gaussian PSF with 0.05′′standard deviation,
and sampled by 0.05′′square pixels. A flat background sky of
0.1 electrons per second is assumed, and an exposure time of 840
secondsisusedtoaddPoissonnoisefromthesourceandbackground
sky.Thesignaltonoiseratioofthebrightestpixelinthesynthetic
imagesis setto∼50,by adjustingthe intensityofthe Sérsicsource
accordingly. No external shear was simulated in the mock data.

4 METHODS
4.1 Weak lensing analysis
We identified galaxies on lines of sight adjacent to strong lenses
using SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), and measured their
shapes using the PyRRG(Harvey et al. 2019) implementation of the
Rhodes et al. (2000) shear measurement method. This estimates
the mean reduced shear in a patch of sky, by averaging galaxies’
apparent shapes
𝜖𝑖=𝜖int
𝑖+𝐺𝛾𝑖, (13)
which have been transformed by weak lensing (Section 2.1) from an
unknown intrinsic shape 𝜖int. The ‘shear responsivity’ 𝐺varies as a
functionofgalaxyflux,anditsoverallscalinghasbeencalibratedon
simulated images with known shear (Leauthaud et al. 2007). Under

Following Massey et al. (2007), we assume that the median redshift

our results change significantly if we adjust this value.

We measure 𝜎int∼0.3, consistent with Leauthaud et al. (2007),
and hence uncertainty 𝜎int/√

our achieved level of precision because the near-circular symmetry
of most lenses means that the lens contributes negligibly to ⟨𝛾𝑖⟩
inside a 60′′circular aperture.
4.2 Strong lensing analysis
We analysed all data using the automated strong lens modelling
software PyAutoLens1(Nightingale et al. 2018, 2021b). This fits
parameters of the lens model using all of the pixels in an image (not
just e.g. locations of the centre of light, as in previous works).
The pipelines used to fit the mock and observed data are
describedfullyinC22andE22respectively.Briefly,wemodelthe
distributionof massinbothmockandrealdatausinganelliptical
power law (equation 11) plus external shear (equation 12). We
then repeat the fit, fixing external shear 𝛾ext=0. We model the
distribution of lightin in real lens galaxies using a double Sérsic
profile with a centre that is free to vary independently to that of
the mass distribution, and for the source galaxy using an adaptive
Voronoi mesh of pixels. For the mock data, we use C22’s fit in
which the lens light is perfectly subtracted and the source light is
modelled as an elliptical Sérsic. C22 also performed fits using a
Voronoi mesh for the source light. However, since the mock data
were created assuming a Sérsic source, the model we chose can
perfectly describe the source, so any systematics we observe will
be solely due to mismatch between the model and truth of the mass
distribution, which is the point of interest in this study.
In appendix A we perform two test of our shear measurements:
(i) we refit every strong lens model including one or two nearby
bright galaxies explicitly as singular isothermal sphere and; (ii) use

5.1 SL shears do not correlate with WL shears
Stronglensingmeasurementsof shear 𝛾SL(obtainedasthebest-fit
external shear 𝛾ext) typically have amplitudes up to an order of
magnitudelargerthanweaklensingmeasurements 𝛾WLalongthe
same line of sight. The mock lenses have mean best-fit |⟨𝛾SL⟩|=0.019±0.002, despite the true values all being 𝛾ext=0. Our
measurementusingaPL+extmassmodelisconsistentwithC22’s
value|⟨𝛾SL⟩|=0.015using pixel-based source reconstructions.
The real lenses have mean best-fit shear |⟨𝛾SL⟩|=0.098±0.011,
which is much larger than both the measured weak lensing shear
|⟨𝛾WL⟩|=0.028±0.002.
Strong lensing measurements of shear do not correlate with
weak lensing measurements (Figure 2). To make this comparison

the uncertainty is likely underestimated. The Pearson correlation

is also a large amount of scatter.

Forbothmockandrealdata,thebest-fit‘external’shearisusually

or with its minor axis ( 𝜙PL+extmass−𝜙PL+ext

power law model to represent the more complex true distribution of
mass. Furthermore, the highest values of 𝛾extare also usually found
in the most elliptical lenses.
In mock data, 84 %of external shears are aligned with the

has the lowest shear amplitude ( 𝛾ext=0.0003), so the angle 𝜙extis

axis ratios and external shears is −0.63.
Real HST data produce a similar pattern, but with more scatter.
Best-fit ‘external’ shears are aligned with the mass distribution in
68%of the lenses, and anti-aligned in 20%. All the remaining 12%

5.3 SL Shear Amplitudes Are Too Large
Along random lines of sight through the universe a shear amplitude
of∼1−3%is expected (Keeton et al. 1997), even accounting for
thedifferentscalesonwhichtheyareaveraged(Valageasetal.2004;Wongetal.2011).SLACSandGALLERYstronglensestypically
exist in field environments where shear amplitudes should therefore
never exceed∼5%(Treu et al. 2009), however figure Figure: shear
angleqshowsthemajorityofmeasuredSLshearamplitudesexceed
∼5%and a large fraction exceed ∼10%. Therefore, even without
WL data or detailed inspection of the SL mass models, the SL shear
measurements alone are indicative of a non external origin.

since the mass distribution is coincidentally orientated with it’s

5.4.2 MACS1149-GGL20
The shears measured using the independent probes for MACS1149-
GGL20 are also in agreement, although the shear magnitude is
much lower than is measured for the snail. In fact, this is one
of the few lenses that measures a lower best-fit value of shear
magnitude with strong lensing 𝛾ext=0.01than it does with the
weak lensing method 𝛾WL=0.04. Desprez et al. (2018) found that

There is also a neighbour galaxy in close proximity to MACS1149-
GGL18.We,thereforerepeatthefitforincludinganSISaswasdone
for Abell370-GGL19. The shear is significantly overestimated as
compared with weak lensing when the neighbour is not included
in the fit. Including the neighbour galaxy halves the inferred strong
lensing external shear, but this is still inconsistent with the weak
lensing measurement. The shear is anti-aligned with the power-law
mass distribution which, given that the mass distribution is not
aligned with the cluster galaxy in this case, suggests the external
shear may be acting internally as discussed in the previous section.6 ANALYSIS
6.1 External shear may compensate for boxiness/diskiness
OurmeasurementsinSection5suggestthat 𝛾extmostlyjustcompen-
satesfortheinabilityofapowerlawmodeltocapturethecomplex
distributions of mass (gNFW+MGE for the mocks, and likely more
complex for real galaxies). This is consistent with the conclusion
of Keeton et al. (1997), who inferred that the ⟨𝛾ext⟩∼ 10–15%
requiredtofitpoint-sourcequadlenses,mustreflectaninabilityof
thelensmodeltocaptureacomplexdistributionofmass:perhaps
misalignment between light and dark matter. Witt & Mao (1997)
reachedasimilarconclusion,andderivedananalyticalpredictionof
the shear required by an elliptical potential to fit quad lenses.
If the external shears result from a lack of complexity in the
power law model to describe the underlying distribution of mass,
one can ask what type of complexity the data requires. One possible
deviation from the symmetry of an elliptical power law is boxiness
and diskiness (see Section 4.3). We shall now investigate whether
spurious external shear could arise to compensate for boxy/disky
lens galaxies.
6.1.1 External shear creates boxy/disky critical curves

curve (oriented in the same direction as the mass distribution but at

external shear, 𝛾ext≠0, perturbs the critical curves (left panel of
Figure 4). These perturbations include significant 𝑎4/𝑎moments
(right panels of Figure 4), although they visually appear to be more
than pure𝑚=4modes (c.f. Figure 1).
6.1.2 Disky critical curves come from disky mass distributions
The distributions of mass in our mock lenses happen to be almost
all disky. We could measure any isodensity contour, but the 𝜅=1
contour will be near the most sensitive region for lens fitting. These
iso-convergencecontourshavemean ⟨|𝑎4/𝑎|⟩=0.01and⟨|𝑏4/𝑎|⟩=
0.0005. Only three lenses are boxy, but not usefully so, with very
low values⟨𝑎4/𝑎⟩=−0.0003.
Critical curvesof the best-fit PL+ext models to ourmock data
show𝑎4/𝑎momentshighlycorrelatedwiththoseofthedensitycon-
tours (Figure 5). Again, ⟨|𝑏4/𝑎|⟩=0.0001is an order of magnitude
lower.Studyingthesamemocks,C22alsonotedthat‘external’shear
allowed the best-fit critical curves to better match the true critical
curves.Wefindtwosystemswithboxycriticalcurves 𝑎4/𝑎 <−0.01.
Subject to some scatter, however, we conclude that the diskiness of
isodensity contours and critical curves are highly correlated.
Notably,allmocklenseswhosebest-fitexternalshearisaligned
withthemassdistributionhaveverydiskycriticalcurves(redpoints
in Figure 6), and the three mock lenses with boxy critical curves
haveanti-alignedshear.Furthermore, 𝑎4typicallyincreaseswiththe
externalshear(Pearsoncorrelationcoefficient0.45)andwiththeaxis
ratioofthelensmass(Pearsoncorrelationcoefficient −0.73).This
maybetentativeevidencethat(someof)thedichotomyofaligned
and anti-aligned shears may be caused by diskiness or boxiness.
6.1.3 Does boxiness/diskiness cause ‘external’ shear?
Scatter in real data is larger than in the mocks. However, for
SLACS and GALLERY lenses, the best-fit critical curves have
mean⟨|𝑎4/𝑎|⟩=0.016, similar to the mocks. Most ( 79%of) lenses

haveboxycriticalcurves(Figure7).Moreover,lenseswiththelargest
amplitude of external shear also have critical curves with the largest
deviations from elliptical (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.48
with𝑎4and 0.65 with 𝑏4).
This provides tentative evidence that ‘external’ shear in typical
lensing analyses is really caused by the inability of parametric mass
models to capture the complex distribution of mass in a lens. A
substantial portion of that complexity may be diskiness or boxiness
of the mass distribution. This creates diskiness or boxiness in the
critical curves (Section 6.1.2), which leads to a spurious external
shear (Section 6.1.1). We have not been able to quantify the relative
contributionstoexternalshearfromtrueshear,diskiness/boxiness,
or other sources.
MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2023)‘External shear’ is not shear 9
6.1.4 More things probably cause ‘external’ shear too
There are likely more sources of complexity in real mass distribu-
tions, which cause (or are compensated by) external shear. These
confounding factors wouldexplainthe looser correlations and larger
scatter than in the mocks. Just the observation that real lenses have
externalshearswithamplitudessixtimesgreaterthanmocksimplies
that their distribution of mass deviates more from a power law.
We speculate that the isodensity contours of a lens might be
twisted (misaligned as a function of radius), like their isophotoes.
Indeed, the criticalcurves of SLACSand GALLERY lenses havea
handedness,with⟨|𝑏4/𝑎|⟩=0.012twoordersofmagnitudelarger
than the mocks. If the critical curves do tell us something about the
distributionofmass,thismayindicatetwistedisodensitycontours.
Twistingisalsosuggestedbytheinconsistentlymeasuredposition
angle when real data are fitted with and without external shear (see
Figure 9); this is not present in the mocks. Van de Vyvere et al.
(2022) also found that twists in the underlying mass distribution are
typicallyabsorbedbychangesinorientationofthemassdistribution
andshear inaPL+extmodel. Themaximumamplitude ofexternal
shear thatcan be attributedto these twistsis around 5%to8%(see
FiguresB3 andB4ofVandeVyvereetal.2022), butlowervalues
are more common for most of their mock lenses. Given many of
ourstronglenseshaveshearamplitudesabove ∼10%,twistsalone
cannot explain all of the SL shears measured.
6.2 External shear biases other SL model parameters
Since best-fit values of ‘external’ shear may not (entirely) represent
the physical quantity they are imagined to, we now test which other
parameters in the mass model are biased by their inclusion, and
which are still robustly measured. As an extreme alternative, we
repeat all measurements but fix 𝛾ext
1=𝛾ext
2=0when we refit the
mass distribution.
6.2.1 Mock lenses
The orientation of themass distributionis robustly measured,with
mean difference⟨|𝜙PL+extmass−𝜙PLmass|⟩∼1◦and only∼1◦of scatter
when shear is excluded (figure 8). The axis ratio is also hardly
changed, with⟨𝑞PL+ext−𝑞PL⟩=0.01±0.05. These values are so
robustbecausealltheMGEcomponentsshareacommonaxis,which
is therefore well-defined.
However,theEinsteinradiiandslopesofthepower-lawmass

relative orientation of the shear and the mass (Einstein radii and
power-law slopes are known to be degenerate parameters: see e.g.
figure5ofE22).Forlenseswhoseshearswerealignedwiththemass
distribution, removing 𝛾extincreases the mean best-fit power-law
slope by 0.20%±0.04(blue points in figure 8; their mean best-fit
Einstein radii decrease by 0.2±0.03%). For lenses whose shears
were anti-aligned, the power-law slopes decrease by 0.07±0.03
(red points in figure 8; their mean best-fit Einstein radii increase
by0.08±0.04). Across the entire sample, Einstein radii had been
correctly measured when including 𝛾ext(within 0.05±0.17%; Cao

7 INTERPRETATION
7.1 Strong lensing external shears are not measuring shear
We find that external shear, as measured by galaxy-galaxy strong
lensing, does not correlate well with the true shear along a line-
of-sight (as measuredindependently by weak lensing;Section 5.1
and Figure 2). Best-fit values of external shear are also frequently
several times higher than that along typical lines of sight through
theUniverse,soonlyasmallfractionofitcouldbeduetotrueshear.
Rather, external shear tends to align with either the major axis or
minor axis of the lens mass distribution (Section 5.2). It appears to
becompensatingfortheinflexibilityoftypicalmassmodels(herean
elliptical power-law) to represent the complex distributions of mass.
A substantial portion of that complexity appears to be diskiness
and boxiness (Section 6.1), especially in mock data. In real data,
isophotaltwists,ellipticalgradients,andoffsetsinthecentresand
alignments of dark and stellar matter all increase uncertainty on
model parameters. These have all been seen in the stellar mass of
SLACSlenses(Nightingaleetal.2019).Wehavenotbeenableto
quantify how much each source contributes to the scatter or bias in
a real measurement of external shear.
Hoggetal.(2022)suggestadifferent,‘minimalline-of-sight’
way of parameterising the shear that is less degenerate with lens
model parameters, but this is still subject to biases in the shear
parameters when simplifying assumptions are made for the lens
model.Forcomplexdistributionsoflensmass,thefalseinferenceof
external shear will pose a challenge for efforts to use strong lensing
to measure cosmic shear (e.g. Birrer et al. 2017; Fleury et al. 2021).7.2 Implications for strong lensing science goals
Includingexternalshearaltersthebest-fitvaluesofotherparameters

Furthermore, a PL+ext model leaves false detections of subhalos in
a mock disky galaxy (He et al. 2023) or real HST data (Nightingale
et al. 2023a).
The Hubble constant 𝐻0can be measured from the time delay
betweenmultipleimages(Suyuetal.2017;Wongetal.2019;Birrer
et al. 2019). However, assuming specific functional forms for the
mass model can artificially break the mass-sheet transformation.
Our tests on mock data (Section 6.2.1) demonstrate a coupling,
predicted by Kochanek (2021), betweenangular and radial structure.

Sluse 2013; Xu et al. 2016; Kochanek 2020; Gomer & Williams
2018,2020,2021).Moreflexiblemodels,suchasaddinganinternal
mass sheet to the PL+ext model which is contstrained via stellar
dynamics, have been introduced to mitigate these systematics.
Combining𝐻0measurementsfromalargepopulationoflenses
might average away individual biases up to 10kms−1Mpc−1, on the
assumption that boxy and disky mass distributions are equally well
represented(VandeVyvereetal.2022).However,thediskinessofthe
massdistributioncorrelateswiththediskinessofthe(observable)
PL+ext critical curves (Section 6.1.2), and our observationally-
selectedsamplecontainsanoverpopulationof71%diskygalaxies

internalmasssheet)havealsobeenintroduced(Birreretal.2020),

(Schaller et al. 2015), so it is not clear that complexities in the mass

withstellardynamics(Etheringtonetal.2023),andspuriousfalse-

VandeVyvereetal.2022)tounderstandthetypesofasymmetries
that must be accounted for in the lens modelling, and the possibility
of constraining such models, will be invaluable.
What parametric forms allow sufficient complexity — in a
minimum number of parameters that need to be constrained? Even
our gNFW+MGE mocks still do not capture the full complexity
of real lenses, but their MGEs were forced to be aligned. Perhaps
the model could have both 𝑎4and𝑏4perturbations, varying as
a function of radius. Cluster-scale models frequently use a soft
core inside some scale radius, and (Limousin et al. 2022) add B-
splinefunctions.Thenumberoffreeparametersmustbebalanced
with the information available: pixellated mass models are generally
underconstrained(andalthoughtheymightbeabletofitobservations
without external shear; Valls-Gabaud et al. 2006, some line-of-sight
shear isexpected for galaxy-scale lenses). To instead increase the
availableinformation,thetotalmasscouldbedecomposedintodark
matterandstellarcomponents,withthelatter informedbythe lens
light(whichisotherwiseanuisance).Whatevertheparametricform,
the azimuthal degrees of freedom must be defined carefully to avoid
thebiasdescribedbyKochanek(2021)ontheinferenceoftheradial
mass distribution. We suggest more studies (e.g. Van De Vyvere
et al. 2020; Van de Vyvere et al. 2022, C22), embedded deeply in
each specific science case, to quantify the impact of simplifying
assumptions.
A silver lining is that the sensitivity of galaxy-galaxy strong
lensingdatamaybeanewopportunity.Bothourresultsandthose
of Van De Vyvere et al. (2022) suggest that it might be possible

to measure the diskiness or boxiness of galaxies’ dark matter ha-
los.Ourresultsareevenmoreoptimistic:ifmeasurablemultipole

APPENDIX A: SYSTEMATIC TESTS OF SHEAR
MEASUREMENT
Real external shear is caused by galaxies or clusters of galaxies
adjacent to the line of sight (Wong et al. 2011). It is possible
that individual galaxies impart a localised external shear that is
unmeasurable by weak lensing, which averages over large spatial
scales. Here we repeat our analysis of every SLACS and GALLERY
lens,butincludingadjacentgalaxiesinthemassmodel.Crucially,
weuseidenticallenslightsubtractionandsourcepixellization,so
we can directly compare the inferred shears.

model found in the main paper.

APPENDIX B: SENSITIVITY TO SOURCE MODEL
We investigate whether the shear measurements presented in the
mainpaperdependonassumptionsrelatedtothesourcemodel.Inthe
main paper, we followed Etherington et al. (2023) in reconstructing
the source using a Voronoi pixel mesh and a regularization scheme
that adapted to the unlensed source luminosity (see Nightingale
et al. 2018). As an alternative, here we model the same lenses using
a Delaunay pixel mesh and the interpolation-based regularization
scheme described in appendix A of Nightingale et al. (2023a).
The best-fit external shear with this alternative source-plane
pixellizationhasamplitudeandanglethatisconsistentwiththoseinthemainpaper,fornearlyeverylens(seeFigureA2).Ourmain
conclusionsarethusunaffectedbyevensubstantialchangesinsource
