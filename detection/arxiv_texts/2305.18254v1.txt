We investigate the effects of the Einstein cubic gravity (ECG) on regular black
hole solutions driven by nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) sources. The ECG tends
to form a naked singularity at the origin for a high ECG coupling constant. Assum-
ing that ECG provides only perturbative corrections to the regular magnetic charged
solutions, we found modified regular solutions with a de Sitter-like core whose cos-
mological constant depends on the magnetic charge and the ECG coupling constant.
The thermodynamic stability is investigated by means of the Hawking temperature
and the heat capacity. In fact, for a small charge and ECG coupling, the Hawk-
ing temperature is regularized, leaving a thermodynamic stable remnant for a small
rh̸= 0. The heat capacity reveals that the ECG regular black hole undergoes a
phase transition between an unstable into a stable configuration.
I. INTRODUCTION
Black holes are one of the most striking predictions of the general relativity (GR). After
the observation of gravitational waves (GW) from binary black hole mergers [1] and the
data collected from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) [2], new windows were open to
probe Einstein gravity (EG) and its extensions in the strong field regime. Several modified
gravity theories possesses black hole solutions, among them we highlight the f(R) [3], non-
commutative [4] and Lorentz violating theories [5, 6]. These modified solutions may shed

some light into viable quantum gravity models [7].
Among the expected features of modified gravity models, higher derivative theories nat-
urally appears due to quantum corrections of the EG [8]. In addition, string theory predicts
the presence of higher curvature terms steaming from an effective low energy limit of the
Born-Infeld term [9]. A particular higher curvature modified theory is the so called Lovelock
theory constructed with a Lagrangian quadratic in the Riemann tensor whose equation of
the motion (EOM) are of second-order [10]. In four dimensions, the Lovelock gravity is given
by EG plus the Gauss-Bonnet term, and thus, the theory has the same degrees of freedom
(DOF) of the EG. Modified Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theories with the same DOF of
EG can lead to non-singular strong field solutions [11–13].
By adding cubic powers of the Riemann tensor, only one particular combination yields a
new Lagrangian term P, with the same DOF of the EG, at least at the weak field regime
[14]. Accordingly, this higher-order theory was named Einstein cubic gravity (ECG) [14]. In
the strong field regime, the ECG still produces singular black holes for the static solutions
[15, 16]. Moreover, stationary [17, 18] and charged modified black hole solutions [19–23]
were also found in ECG. In cosmology, ECG dynamics can produce both an early and late
expansion epochs [24–27], and with a bounce between two De Sitter vaccua [28]. The ECG
effects on quasinormal modes (QNM) [29], shadows [30] and gravitational lensing were also
discussed [31].
The resolution of spacetime singularities is another motivation for studying modified
gravitational theories. Although supported by the well-known singularity theorems [32, 33],
the singularities can be avoided in EG by adding non-standard sources. Indeed, Sakharov
[34] and Gliner [35] proposed that a vacuum configuration leading to a De Sitter core near
the origin could lead to a regular black hole [36]. Bardeen [37] proposed a regular black
hole solution which latter Ayon-Beato-Garcia [38, 39] and Bronikov [40] showed to be the
result of a nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) as a source. Hayward constructed a regular
black hole by assuming a particular mass function [41]. Fan and Wang constructed a family
of regular black holes solutions in NLE which contains the Bardeen, Hayward and a new
class solutions [42]. The interpretation of the parameters and the regimes of the solutions
was latter improved by Bronikov [43] and Toshmatov et al [44]. Regular black hole solutions
were also found in modified gravity theories, such as in f(R) [45], Lovelock [46], Palatini [47],
Born-Infeld [48] and GUP-corrected gravity [49]. Although plagued with internal instabilities3
[50], regular black holes can be understood as effective smoothed quantum gravity corrected
solutions near the origin [51].
In this work we study how the ECG gravity modifies the regular black hole solutions.
Assuming a two parameter dependent nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangian which provides
the magnetically charged Bardeen, Hayward and new class solutions, we numerically found
the metric solution for the modified gravitational equations. It turns out that the ECG-NLE
solutions exhibit a singular behaviour near the origin. For large values of the ECG coupling
constant, even naked singularities are formed. Considering perturbative ECG effects, a
balance between the ECG and NLE yields to regular black holes with a De Sitter core and a
modified horizon. The thermodynamic stability of these solutions were analysed by means
of the Wald entropy [52, 53] and the corresponding heat capacity. For small black holes,
the temperature decreases until it vanishes for a non zero mass. As a result, stable remnant
configurations was found. Likewise the EG regular solutions [15, 54–56], Lovelock [57] and
f(T) [58] black holes, the entropy does not satisfy the usual Berkestein-Hawking expression,
allowing thermodynamic stable states.
The work is organized as the follows. In the section II we present the main features of
the ECG, as well as the NLE Lagrangian we used as the source for the regular solutions.
In Sec.III we obtain the static and spherically symmetric solutions of ECG-NLE dynam-
ics, analysing the presence of singularities and horizons. In sec. IV, we investigate the
perturbative effects of ECG on the regular Bardeen, Hayward and the new class solutions.
The thermodynamic analysis and stability is performed in the Sec. V. Final comments and
discussion are outlined in the sec. VI. A number of useful results are summarized in the
appendices. We work in (3 + 1) dimension and with units where c= 1.
II. EINSTEIN CUBIC GRAVITY COUPLED TO A NONLINEAR ELECTRODYNAMICS
We start by defining the action for the model we are studing. Let us consider the Einstein
cubic gravity (ECG) coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics field (NED) of the type [14]
S=1
16πGˆ
d4x√−g
R−G2λP+L(F)
, (1)
where Gis the Newton constant and λis a dimensionless coupling constant which we will
assume to be positive, λ≥0. The ECG term Pis an invariant construct with contractions4
of the curvature tensor up to third order [14]. There is an unique combination of this cubic
gravity which shares the same graviton spectrum with Einstein gravity (EG) in the weak
field regime, and that has dimension-independent coupling constants, namely [14]
P= 12Rµρ

δν+Rρσ
µνRγσ
ρσRµν
γσ−12RµνρλRµρRνσ+ 8Rν
µRρ
νRµ
ρ.(2)
The cubic gravity theory governed by the action in Eq.1 with Pgiven by Eq.2 is called
Einstein cubic gravity (ECG) [14].
On the other hand, the L(F) term is a nonlinear electromagnetic field, where Fis the
field strength of the vector field Adefined by F:=FµνFµν, where Fµν=∂µAν−∂νAµ. The
most general ansantz for Ais given by
A=ϕ(r)dt+Qmcosθdϕ, (3)
where ϕ(r) is a like-scalar potential of Maxwell and the Qmis the total magnetic charge
defined by
Qm=1
4πˆ
F. (4)
Moreover, the equation of motion like-Maxwell and the Bianchi identities for NED, respec-
tively, are given by
Dµ(LFFµν) = 0 Dµ(∗Fµν) = 0 (5)
where LF=∂L
∂Fand∗Fµνis the dual field.
The Lagrangian density we adopt in order to describe the NED [42] is given by
L(F) =4a
α(αF)b+3
4
[1 + ( αF)b
4]1+a
b(6)
where a > 0 is a dimensionless constant which characterizes the strength of nonlinearity
of the electrodynamics field, bis extra a dimensionless parameter and α > 0 is constant
parameter ([ α] =L2).
In case with magnetic charges, i.e., ϕ(r) = 0, we can find different regular black hole
solutions. For instance, if a= 3 and b= 2 in Eq.(6) we find the Bardeen solution [37], but if
a=b, so we have the Hayward solution [[41]]. For a weak field strength F, we have that the
Lagrangian density (6) is given by L(F)∼αb−1
4Fb+3
4. Therefore, only for the critical value
b= 1, it is possible to recover the Maxwellian limit. Furthermore, as noted by Ref.[42],
the regularity of black hole solutions found for a=bhappens when a≥3. So we choose5
a= 3 in Eq. (6 ) which leads to Hayward black hole solution [[55]]. Besides, there is a class
of solutions that generate a lot of interest, because in the weak field limit, the Lagrangian
density (6) is the same as Maxwell Lagrangian, this class is reached when a= 3 and b= 1
[15], and is known as New Class.
In this article, we study only the corrections due to the presence of the magnetic monopole
Qm. The solutions of magnetically charged black holes (Λ 0= 0) in the NED for a Einstein-
Hilbert gravitational action are given by [49]

where . noted that it is necessary to make an equivalence between the gravitational mass
and a kind of magnetically induced mass, i.e., MG =q3/α, to obtain a correct interpretation
of the parameters in the solution [44]. Here, we are interested in study how the modified
Einstein cubic gravity modifies the magnetically charged solutions.
III. SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC SOLUTION IN (3+1) DIMENSIONS
In this section, we obtain new regular black holes solutions with spherical and static
symmetry in ECG. Then, the effects of the ECG and the nonlinear electrodynamics on the
spacetime geometry are investigated.
As shown in Ref.[15], it is possible to simplify the problem by considering the ansantz
ds2=−N(r)2f(r)dt2+dr2
f(r)+r2dθ2+r2sin2θdϕ2. (8)
In this way, the action (1) depend on the functions Nandf, i.e., S[N, f]. Motivated by
Ref.[15], it is possible to show that if the variation of the action (1) in relation to the functions
Nandfvanishes,i.e.,
δS[N, f]
δN=δS[N, f]
δf= 0, (9)
then the components Υ tt=1√−gδS
δgttand Υ rr=1√−gδS
δgrrof the equation of motion also vanish.
Moreover, the angular equations are ensured through the Bianchi identities, Dµ

Substituting (8) in (1), we find with the aid of integration by part when necessary (surface
terms are disregarded) that

cosmological constant on our solutions, so we will assume that Λ 0= 0 for the rest of the
paper. Thus, by the condition (9) , we reduce the problem of find the EOM to a second-order
equation for a single function f.
In order to facilitate the numerical analysis of Eq. (10), we introduce the dimensionless
variables given by x≡r

=C (11)
where Cis an integration constant. In order to ensure that in the limit λ= 0, we obtain
the solution (7), we assume that C= 0.
The Eq.(11) is a rather complicated non-linear equation to tackle. It is worthwhile to
mention that, for q= 0 (no magnetic charge) and λ= 0 (Einstein-Hilbert action), the
Eq.(11) yields to x(f−1) =−1, whose solution is
f(x) = 1−1
x, (12)
which is the Schwarzchild solution, as expected. Therefore, the inclusion of the ECG terms
transforms the Eq.(11) from an algebraic to a differential equation.
We performed a numerical solution of Eq.(11) by assuming that as x→ ∞ , then f→0
as well as f′→0. In the first Fig.(1), we plotted the solutions for ˜ q= 0 and varied the
values of λ. For G2λ= 0.6(GM)4(black line) and G2λ= 0.8(GM)4(green line) no new
event horizons appeared, we just have a shift in the size of the horizons with respect to the7
Schwarzschild solution (orange line), but for G2λ= 8(GM)4(red line) the solution is finite
at the origin and asymptotically approaches the Schwarchild solution. It is important to
mention that these results agree with those found in the Ref.([15]). Further, the solution we
found has an event horizon that is larger than Schwarzschild. Finally, we have a solution
forG2λ= 16( GM)4(blue line) that has a naked singularity, although it is asymptotically
flat. Thus, the ECG itself leads to a singular modified black hole solution. However, as λ
increases, the black hole undergoes a transition into a naked singularity.

x=r/2GM.
Now let us consider the influence of the magnetic charge qof the Bardeen solution.
Qualitatively, the numerical results for the other cases - Hayward case ( a=b= 3) and the
New Class ( a= 3 and b= 1) - are the same as those obtained for Bardeen. In Figs.(1) we
plotted f(x) for various values of G2λ/(2GM)4with different values of ˜ q. Note that, for
˜q= 1 there are two event horizons in G2λ= 8(GM)4(red line). On the other hand, we have
only one event horizon for G2λ= 16( GM)4(blue line) . For G2λ= 0.8(2GM)4(green line)
andG2λ= 0.6(2GM)4(black line) we have a singularity at the origin and one horizon.
A key feature to discuss is the presence of a singularity at the origin. As seen from Figs.
(1), the Eq. (11) admits finite solutions in r= 0. Assuming that f(r) =P∞
i=0airi(returning8
to the original variables), where f(0)≡c0andf′′(0)≡c2, and substituting this power series
in Eq.(11), we obtain that near the origin the solution is given by
f(r) =c0+c2r2+(48c2
2G2λ−1)
192c0G2λr4−(−16c3
2G2λq4+c2q4+ 2GMq )
576(c0−1)c0G2λq4r6(13)
where we assume that f′(0) = 0 and c0,2are free parameters. The Kretschmann scalar,
K=RµνρσRµνρσbehaves at the origin as K∼(c0−1)2
r4. Thus, the solution is singularity-free
provided that c0= 1. Interestingly, it turns out that the solution (13) is the same for the
three cases of interest: Bardeen, Hayward and New class. Therefore, unlike the standard
case of the GR, λ= 0, the presence of the ECG might lead to black holes with singularities
even with the addition of nonlinear electrodynamics field. In the next section, we employ
a perturbative analysis upon a magnetic regular solution in order to probe the corrections
given by the ECG.
IV. PERTURBATIVE ANALYSIS
Even though the Eq.(11) has no analytic solution, we can understand how the corrections
due to ECG can modify the NLE magnetic black hole solution (7) through a perturbative
analysis. Assuming a f(r) function of form
f(r) = 1−2MGra−1
(qb+rb)a
b+h(r), (14)
where h(r)<<1, i.e., we can linearize the field equation (11) about the magnetically charged
background. Considering only the linear terms in h, we obtain the following equation
h′′(r) +γ(r)h′(r) +ω2h(r) =j(r), (15)
where the expressions for the γ,ω2andjcoefficients have a rather cumbersome expression
and we shown them in the Appendix A. We explore the behaviour of the solutions for the
asymptotic region and at the origin.
A. Asymptotic behavior
Let us now examine the behaviour of the solution of Eq. (15) for large r. In this regime
the leading terms of the coefficients γandω2are
γ(r)≈ −2
r(16)9
and
ω(r)2=−r3
72G3Mλ. (17)
Moreover, the NLE term can be expanded as

which tends asymptotically to −2GM. Thus, the solution of the linearized Eq. (15) for

, (19)
which has the same form as one found in Ref.[15] for q= 0. Therefore, the modifications
given by the NLE magnetic charge are asymptotically suppressed when compared to the
corrections driven by the ECG.
B. Behavior at origin
Now consider the Eq. (15) for small r, i.e., near to the origin. The competition between
the singular behaviour of the ECG and the regular NLE dynamics will determine the presence
or the resolution of the singularity.
1. Bardeen solution
The Bardeen Lagrangian density ( a= 3 and b= 2 in Eq. (6)) has the coefficients γand
ω2given by
γ(r)≈3
r(20)
and
ω(r)2≈ξ2
B
r2(21)
where ξ2
B≡ − 8 +8MG

h (r)≈c1r−(1+√

B)+c2r(√

B−1), where c1andc2are constants.For a regular
at the origin, we choose c1= 0, so that
ha=3,b=2
h (r)≈c2r(√
1−ξ2
B−1), (22)10
where ξ2
B≤0. At leading order, a particular solution for the Bardeen Lagrangian density is

p (r)≈ −128G5M3λ

Thus, the general solution of Eq.(15) for modified Bardeen solution by the ECG near the
origin is given by
h(r)a=3,b=2

B−1)−128G5M3λ
q9r2+576G4M2λ(3q+GM)

λ2, r3
.(24)
It is worthwhile to mention the presence of a De Siter-like core near the origin, as shown
by the term128G5M3λ
q9r2. From Eq.(14), for c2= 0 the function fsatisfies f(0) = 1, and
thus, the Kretschmann scalar vanishes at the origin. Therefore, small perturbations of the
Bardeen regular black hole driven by the ECG preserves the absence of the singularity at
the origin.
2. Hayward solution
Now let us analyze the Hayward Lagrangian density ( a=b= 3 in Eq. (6). For this
non-Maxwellian weak field limit case, we find that the coefficients γandω2near the origin
are given by
γ(r)≈4
r(25)
and
ω(r)2≈ξ2

where ξ2

where A, B are constants and Iν(x) and Kν(x) are the modified Bessel functions of the first
and second kinds, respectively. To leading order in small r, this can be expanded as
ha=b=3
h (r)≈c2q
πξ5
Hr−5/4exp[−ξHr−1

where A= 0 to ensure that the solution is regular at the origin. Finally, we have that the
particular solution linear in λis given by

p (r)≈ −128G5M3λ
q9r2+384G5M3λ

For a regular black hole solution, we can consider the particular choice c2= 0.
3. New class
As the last possible configuration for the Lagrangian (6), we adopt a new class of solutions
obtained by Ref.[[42]], whose weak field limit leads to Maxwell Lagrangian. This new class is
defined when b= 1. As already mentioned, it is necessary that a≥3 to reach the regularity
of the solutions at the origin. Thus again we choose the case when a= 3. The coefficients
γandω2for this choice are
γ(r)≈2
r(31)
and
ω(r)2≈ −6
r2, (32)
so that we have that the homogeneous solution is given by hb=1,a=3
h (r)≈˜cr2+˜d
r3, where ˜ c
and˜dare constants. For ˜d= 0 we obtain a regular homogeneous solution in the origin given
by
ha=3,b=1
h (r)≈˜cr2. (33)
On the other hand, the particular solution to first order in λis given by
ha=3,b=1

Thus, the general regular solution of Eq.(15) for New Class near the origin is given by

(35)
Therefore, for all nonlinear electrodynamics solutions studied (Bardeen, Hayward, New
class), the perturbations given by the ECG still yield to regular black holes. Moreover,
around the origin, the metric exhibits a De Sitter-like behaviour whose local cosmological
constant is proportional to the magnetic charge, the mass and the ECG constant λ.12
C. Horizon
After we studied the modifications performed by the ECG upon the regular solutions at
the origin and the asymptotic region, let us now explore the effects of the ECG on the black
hole horizon.
We assume that the solution of the EOM (11) vanishes in rh, i.e., f(rh) = 0 and f′(rh)≥0.
We begin by solving the field equation (11) via a series expansion near the horizon using the
ansatz
f(r) = 2 κg(r−rh) +∞X
i=2ai(r−rh)i(36)
where κg=f′(rh)
2is the surface gravity. By substituting the Taylor expansion (36) into Eq.
(11) and solving it order by order in ( r−rh)i, the two lowest-order equations are given by,
respectively,

The higher-order coefficients aiwith i≥3 are determined by quite cumbersome expressions

Note that for λ= 0, we recover the standard result predicted by General Relativity. Obvi-

The Eq.(41) allow us to relate the mass Mto the radius of the horizon rh. For λ=q= 0,
we obtain the usual Schwarzchild radius, i.e., rh=rs= 2GM. For λ̸= 0 and q= 0 (neutral
ECG), the µ0factor guarantees that rh≥rs[15]. On the other hand, for λ̸= 0 and q̸= 0,
the Eq.(41) shows that the displacement of the horizon radius depends on the magnetic
charge qand the specific model given by aandb.
Indeed, as shown in the fig.(2), for a small qthe ECG modified regular black holes have
larger horizon radius for the same M. Nevertheless, for a bigger qthe ECG Hayward black
hole has a smaller horizon radius. Note that the ECG does not produce new horizons.

Similarly, it is possible to obtain an expression for q(rh) for a given Mfrom Eq. (37)

V. THERMODYNAMICS
As discussed in the previous section, the ECG provides interesting new modifications for
the regular black hole event horizon. Since the event horizon features are related to the
black hole thermodynamics, in this section we explore the effects of the ECG on the black
hole thermodynamic functions.
Let us start with the black hole entropy. It is possible to evaluate the entropy of these
black hole solutions by Wald’s formula [52, 53]. Using the Eq. (39) this formula and
considering only the contributions due to cubic gravity for q << r h, the Wald entropy up at
leading order is given by

The exact expression for entropy is shown in the appendix B B3. For q= 0 we recover the

for modified theories of gravity [57].15
Moreover, we can determine the Hawking temperature associated with the ECG magnetic
black hole also from Eq.(39) through the formula T=κg

Note that for q= 0 we obtain the ECG modified Hawking temperature found in Ref.[15].
A noteworthy feature we found is that the Hawking temperature Thvanishes for some
rhnear the origin. The Figs.[4] show the temperature behavior for the Bardeen, Hayward
and New Class cases as a function of the event horizon for large and small qcompared to
the Schawzschild radius. Unlike the Schwarzchild temperature, which diverges as rh→0,
forq >0 (right panel) the temperature vanishes for some rh̸= 0. Since M̸= 0 in these
configurations, the black hole reaches a stable thermodynamic state which no longer emits,
i.e., a remnant. Moreover, as we increase the magnetic charge, the temperature for the
usual regular magnetic black holes tends to diverges at the origin, whereas the modified
ECG solutions lead to a vanishing Hawking temperature for rh= 0.
The behaviour of the Hawking temperature changes dramatically for q <0 (left panel).
For small qand without the ECG corrections, only the Bardeen black hole temperature
vanishes for rh̸= 0. By adding the ECG terms, the Bardeen temperature still vanishes for
rh̸= 0, whereas the Hayward and new class solutions undergo a phase transition. Indeed,
the temperatures exhibit a Schwarzchild-like behaviour for rh≥rcand a decreasing ECG
behaviour for rh≈0 [15]. As the charge increases, the Bardeen solution resembles the ECG
temperature, the Hayward solution undergoes the phase transition described and the new
class diverges as rh→ ∞ . By increasing the ECG coupling, the three regular solutions show
a ECG behaviour near the origin and vanishes asymptotically.
After discussed the behaviour of the Hawking temperature, let us now study the thermo-
dynamic stability of the ECG magnetic solution of Eq.(11), by means of the specific heat
analysis. Using the Wald entropy obtained in eq.(B3) and the Hawking temperature found16

Figure 5: The normalized Tempeture ˜T=T(2MG) as a function of normalized horizon radius ˜ rh
with small and large ˜ qfor various λassuming the Bardeen ( a= 3 and b= 2), Hayward ( a=b= 3)

Forq >0 (left panel), the fig.5 shows a phase transition from a negative into a positive
heat capacity for small qand small λ. Thus, as the black hole emits, it shrinks until a
critical horizon radius rc, wherein the positive heat capacity leads to a small stable remnant.
Keeping a small magnetic charge and increasing the ECG coupling constant, the black18
hole undergoes an inverse phase transition leading to a negative heat capacity for small rh.
Increasing the ECG coupling, the Bardeen and Hayward solutions recover the negative heat
capacity for rh→ ∞ . For a large enough λ, the three solutions exhibits an exotic divergent
positive heat capacity.
The negative charged solutions (right panel) for small qandλalso show a phase transition,
though the heat capacity diverges as rh→0. By increasing the charge and the ECG coupling
constant, the negative heat capacity for rh→ ∞ is recovered. However, C→ −∞ as we
approach the origin. As a result, the q <0 solutions exhibit instabilities in the both rh→0
and the rh→ ∞ regimes.
VI. DISCUSSION
We studied the effects of the Einstein cubic gravity (ECG) on regular black hole solutions.
Despite the presence of higher derivatives, the ECG possess the same degrees of freedom
of Einstein gravity, at least at the perturbative level. In the strong field regime, previous
studies have shown that ECG gravity maintain the singularity at the origin of a static black
hole. We added a nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) lagrangian in order to probe the effects
of ECG on the Bardeen, Hayward and new class regular solutions.
For a ECG coupling constant much larger than the magnetic charge of NLE, the regular
solutions became singular at the origin. The appearance of naked singularities for even
higher ECG constant suggests an upper limit for the ECG in order to satisfy the cosmic
censorship conjecture. However, in the perturbative level, the ECG leads to modified regular
solutions with the usual De Sitter core.
We investigated the black hole stability by means of its thermodynamic analysis. The
ECG and NLE not only regularize the singularity but also prevents the divergence of the
Hawking temperature for small black holes. As shown in the Ref.[15], the temperature
vanishes for rh→0 due to the ECG. By adding the NLE source, we found that the temper-
ature vanishes for rh̸= 0 and M̸= 0. Thus, the regular black hole leaves a non-emitting
and small remnant. The heat capacity revealed that the regular black holes had undergone
phases transitions for a critical horizon radius rh. As the black hole emits and its horizon
shrinks, the heat capacity becomes positive and thus, the black hole end up in a final stable
remnant.19
The present work suggest further investigations on ECG modified regular black holes.
The stability of the perturbed solutions by means of quasinormal modes (QNM) and the
phase space are important issues to be addressed. The transition between a regular into a
singular NLE black hole due to the non-perturbative ECG is another noteworthy perspective.
Moreover, the non trivial form of the entropy points into a general analysis of the first and
second law of black hole thermodynamics in this modified gravitational theory, as performed
in Ref.[58] for the f(T) gravity.

Note that the limit case q= 0, we recover the homogeneous equation obtain by Ref. [[15]]. As
already mentioned in the text, it is easy to show that for the limit of large r (asymptotic limit)
the coefficients γ(r) and ω2(r) coincide with those obtained in Ref[[15]]. However, in the
limit of small r (near the origin), it is necessary to specify which nonlinear electrodynamics
we are dealing with. For the Bardeen case, we obtain that the leading terms in the origin
are given by Eq. (20) and (21). On the other hand, the Hayward case with a=b= 3, the
coefficients are given by (25) and (26). Finally, in the case of a= 3 and b= 1, they are
given by (31) and (32).23
Appendix B: Black hole entropy
We know that the theory of high derivatives of gravity normally does not obey Beken-
stein–Hawking area law for calculating entropy. In this case we need to use Wald’s formula
[52, 53]. Thus, the entropy associated with a static and symmetrically spherical black hole
in ECG is given by
S=−2πˆ
Σd2x√
hδL
δRµναβϵµνϵαβ, (B1)
whereδ
δRµναβis the Euler-Lagrange derivative, his the determinat of the induced metric on
the horizon Σ and ϵµνis the binormal of the horizon.
Applying the formula (B2) to action (1) and assuming ansatz (8) ( N′(r) = 0), we find
that

where we use the fact that f′(rh) = 2 κg. Substituting Eq. (39) in the expression above, we
