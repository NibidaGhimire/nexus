Abstract: Fluids can behave in a highly irregular, turbulent way. It ha s long been
realised that, therefore, some weak notion of solution is re quired when studying the
fundamental partial diﬀerential equations of ﬂuid dynamic s, such as the compressible
or incompressible Navier-Stokes or Euler equations. The st andard concept of weak
solution (in the sense of distributions) is still a determin istic one, as it gives exact
values for the state variables (like velocity or density) fo r almost every point in time
and space. However, observations and mathematical theory a like suggest that this
deterministic viewpoint has certain limitations. Thus, th ere has been an increased
recent interest in the mathematical ﬂuids community in prob abilistic concepts of
solution. Due to the considerable number of such concepts, i t has become challenging
to navigate the corresponding literature, both classical a nd recent. We aim here to
give a reasonably concise yet fairly detailed overview of pr obabilistic formulations
of ﬂuid equations, which can roughly be split into measure-valued andstatistical
frameworks. We discuss both approaches and their relations hip, as well as the
interrelations between various statistical formulations , focusing on the compressible
and incompressible Euler equations.

1 Introduction
When the ﬂow of a ﬂuid, whether compressible or incompressib le, viscous or ideal, is
described within the setting of classical continuum mechan ics, one would generally
expect to obtain a deterministic theory: If the state of the ﬂ uid is fully known at a
certain time, then it should in principle be possible to uniq uely calculate its state at
any subsequent time. This seems in line with the description of ﬂuid ﬂows by means
of nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations, such as the isentropic compressible Euler
equations
∂t(ρu)+div(ρu⊗u)+∇p(ρ) = 0,
∂tρ+div(ρu) = 0,(1)
or the incompressible Euler equations
∂tu+div(u⊗u)+∇p= 0
divu= 0.(2)
These equations can be posed either on an open subset Ω⊂ /CAdor on the torus/CCd, where the space dimension is d≥2in the incompressible and d≥1in the
2compressible case; either way, for some given time T >0, one looks for the unknown
velocity ﬁeld u: (0,T)×Ω→ /CAdand, for (1), also for the unknown density ﬁeld
ρ: (0,T)×Ω→ /CA, which is always non-negative (non-negativity is propagat ed in
time, so it suﬃces to impose a non-negative initial density) . The role of the pressure
is diﬀerent in the two models: In (1) it is a constitutively gi ven function of the
density, while in (2) it is another unknown p: (0,T)×Ω→ /CA. If the boundary of Ω
is non-empty, one usually imposes the impermeability bound ary condition u·n= 0,
wheren:∂Ω→ /CAdis the outer unit normal. This means the ﬂuid may not ﬂow in
or out of the given domain.
Both systems are formally well-posed, as the number of unkno wns matches
the number of equations. The same is true for the correspondi ng viscous models,
where (1) and (2) are supplemented with suitable friction te rms, respectively. In the
case of Newtonian ﬂuids, one thus arrives at the (compressib le or incompressible)
Navier-Stokes equations .
We will deal here primarily with the inviscid models, althou gh much of our
discussion will not be speciﬁc for the Euler equations. Our c hoice has several reasons:
First, turbulent ﬂows typically occur at high Reynolds numb ers, and the Euler
equations correspond to the limiting case of inﬁnite Reynol ds number. Secondly,
from a mathematical viewpoint, the Euler equations display vast ill-posedness in
the framework of weak solutions. Both these observations, a rguably, shake our
naïve attempt to describe turbulent ﬂows deterministicall y.
Indeed, consider an experiment where water ﬂows past an obst acle. In the wake
of the obstacle, a turbulent region is observable. Repeatin g the experiment many
times, one will always see a diﬀerent ﬂow ﬁeld in the turbulen t region; it is not
deterministically predictable, at least not practically. Yet, qualitatively, the result
of the experiment appears similar each time. It turns out tha t, while the details of
the ﬂow ﬁeld are unpredictable, certain statistical quantities of the ﬂow appear to
be very regular and stable, such as the average velocity or th e so-called structure
functions. For a discussion of these observations, see [45] ; extensive state-of-the-art
numerical simulations supporting similar conclusions can be found in [35].
This line of thought is very classical and – at least in the inc ompressible situation
– has led to statistical, phenomenological theories of turb ulence, most prominently
the one of Kolmogorov [65]. The relation between Kolmogorov ’s theory and the
arguably more fundamental PDE-based approach is still very unclear, although the
recent rigorous proof of Onsager’s Conjecture [26, 17, 59, 7 ] provides a fascinating
link.
But also from the analytical viewpoint, there have arisen is sues with the deter-
ministic weak solution concept. It has been known since the w ork of Scheﬀer [78]
that weak solutions of the incompressible Euler equations c an evolve non-uniquely
from the same initial data. While Scheﬀer’s solutions can be discarded as non-
physical artefacts, convex integration techniques develo ped by De Lellis and Széke-
lyhidi have allowed to show that the Cauchy problem remains i ll-posed even under
further energy conditions [19], and that this is the case for a dense subset (in the
energy space) of initial data [79], even in regularity class es up to the Onsager-
critical Hölder exponent [18]. The situation is similar for the compressible Euler
3equations [19, 12, 13, 15, 11].
A conceivable way out of all this trouble is to turn to probabilistic descriptions
of ﬂuid ﬂows, thus abandoning the noble ambition of predicti ng exactly the ﬂuid
velocity (and density) ﬁeld at every time. Instead, for a pro babilistic framework, at
least three diﬀerent options spring to mind:
•trajectory statistical solutions: a probability measure µon the set of
solution trajectories (say of the velocity) of the PDE, for i nstance on the space
C([0,T];H), whereHis the space of solenoidal vector ﬁelds in L2(R3;R3);
•phase space statistical solutions: a time-dependent probability measure
µtwhich, for every time t, lives on phase space (say on H) and whose evolution
is governed in some way by the underlying PDE;
•measure-valued solutions (mvs): a probability measure µt,x, depending
on time and space, that lives on R3and whose dependence on xandtis again
constrained by the underlying equation.
It turns out that the ﬁrst two concepts are closely related, w hile the measure-
valued solutions have a very diﬀerent character. This is bec ause the latter describe
only the one-point statistics of the ﬂow: One can express, in the language of measure-
valued solutions, a statement like “The probability that, a t timetand location x,
the ﬂuid velocity has negative vertical component equals 30 %”, but not a statement
about correlations of the velocity between two diﬀerent points in space, such as “The
probability that the vertical velocity components at time tat space points xand
yhave the same sign is 30%”. Such information on correlations can be extracted
from statistical solutions. This indicates that statistic al solutions contain more
information and thus represent a stronger notion than the me asure-valued concept.
Mathematically, this comes at a price: Measure-valued solu tions, in contrast to
statistical ones, can easily be shown to exist for any initia l data of ﬁnite energy.
In fact, known results indicate that the existence theory fo r statistical solutions is
essentially just as hard as for deterministic weak solution s.
Before we describe in more detail the properties of measure- valued and of statis-
tical solutions to be discussed in the body of this work, let u s point out what will not
be covered here: First, despite the probabilistic ﬂavour of the theory, no actual ran-
domness – and, correspondingly, no genuinely stochastic ma thematical techniques –
will appear. Indeed, although the initial data will typical ly be a probability measure
instead of a deterministic function, the evolution itself w ill not be subject to any
stochastic forcing, for instance. Secondly, in the context of statistical solutions of
the Navier-Stokes equations, one could be interested in the long-time behaviour of
the system from a dynamical systems perspective and talk abo ut statistically sta-
tionary solutions, invariant manifolds, global attractor s, etc. (see for instance [40,
Chapters III & IV]). We shall not say anything about either of these topics, as we
focus on fundamental existence and uniqueness questions an d on the interrelations
between various probabilistic formulations of the Euler eq uations.
41.1 Measure-Valued Solutions of the Euler Equations
Generally speaking, measure-valued solutions are paramet rized probability measures
that solve a partial diﬀerential equation only in an average d sense. In particular, a
(weak) solution can be recovered as a measure-valued soluti on if the latter is equal
to a Dirac distribution. Hence, measure-valued solutions a t a certain point in space-
time consist of a probability distribution of possible valu es instead of one speciﬁc
value. As a consequence, we consider measure-valued soluti ons as an instance of a
probabilistic type of solution. Note that the evolution of t he averages of measure-
valued solutions is constrained by the PDEs. The rigorous de ﬁnition of this very
weak notion of solution will be given below in Section 2.1.
Measure-valued solutions build upon the concept of Young me asures, which are
certain parametrized probability measures. They are named after L. C. Young, who
introduced them in the context of optimal control theory [88 ]. Young measures
are also an eﬀective tool to study the limiting behavior of os cillating sequences in
the calculus of variations and PDE theory, cf. for example [7 4, 80]. As a solution
concept, measure-valued solutions consisting of Young mea sures were introduced by
DiPerna [23] for hyperbolic conservation laws, where they w ere used to give a proof
for the existence of energy admissible weak solution in spac e dimension d= 1by
using compensated compactness.
Measure-valued solutions of the incompressible Euler syst em have been intro-
duced and proven to exist for any initial data by DiPerna and M ajda [25], where the
main technical advance was to include possible concentrati ons. This is not quite the
framework we will discuss here, but we will focus on the forma lism of [28], cf. also
[21]. Neustupa [75] then deﬁned measure-valued solutions f or the compressible Euler
and Navier-Stokes equations and also proved their existenc e. Note that the existence
of measure-valued solutions is particularly interesting w henever weak solutions are
not known to exist for all initial data, which is the case for t he incompressible and
compressible Euler equations and the 3D compressible Navie r-Stokes system with
adiabatic exponent γ≤3/2.
Arguably, the notion of measure-valued solution is a very we ak solution concept.
This is reﬂected by its vast non-uniqueness: The Young measu re is only constrained
in its ﬁrst and second moments (see Deﬁnition 1), whereas for given expectation
and (non-zero) covariance, there is always an inﬁnitude of p robability measures.
On top of this obvious non-uniqueness, a further degree of il l-posedness is inherited
by the non-uniqueness of weak solutions created through con vex integration, cf. for
example [19]. However, somewhat surprisingly, measure-va lued solutions still enjoy
the weak-strong uniqueness property, see [5] for a proof in t he incompressible and [55]
for a proof in the compressible Euler case. A more practical u se of measure-valued
solutions is the description of singular limits of approxim ating solution sequences.
For example, certain numerical schemes for the compressibl e Navier-Stokes system
converge to measure-valued solutions as shown in [29]. See a lso [32] for a discussion
of this topic regarding the vortex-sheet initial data. Othe r measure-valued singular
limits are also studied in [2, 30, 50].
Moreover, for the incompressible Euler equations in space d imensiond≥2it
5holds that every oscillation measure-valued solution is th e limit of some sequence of
weak solutions, cf. Theorem 6 below. Thus, although measure -valued solutions are
only constrained through their ﬁrst and second moment, they contain essentially the
same information as weak solutions.
The latter property has also been a point of criticism in the s ense that measure-
valued solutions only display one-point statistics. Howev er, for an adequate descrip-
tion of turbulence one may also include correlations.
1.2 Statistical Solutions of the Euler Equations
Statistical solutions are generally speaking a probabilis tic concept which aims at
describing the evolution of a whole ensemble of initial data or a whole ensemble of
solutions governed by some PDE.
In the former case, for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations, a ﬁrs t attempt at this
was made by E. Hopf in [57]: Given a probability distribution µon a set of initial
data and assuming that all individual phases uhave been transformed to Stuafter
timet≥0, the distribution µtof the solutions at time tshould be determined by
the formula
µt(A) =µ(S−1
tA) (3)
for all measurable sets A.
As probability distributions are uniquely determined by th eir characteristic func-
tional, i.e. their Fourier transform
F(v,t) =ˆ
exp(i(v,u))dµt(u) =ˆ
exp(i(v,Stu))dµ(u),
Hopf went on and formally derived an equation for F(v,t), the Hopf statistical
equation , which would no longer explicitly depend on the solution ope ratorsSt,
t≥0. In the natural phase space L2of the Navier-Stokes equations, one can express
elementsvof this Hilbert space in terms of abstract Fourier series wit h respect to
suitable orthonormal bases and consequently transform the Hopf statistical equation
on an inﬁnite dimensional space into an equation for the inﬁn itely many (ﬁnite-
dimensional) Fourier coeﬃcients of the argument vofF. This was considered and
rigorously solved in 1976 by Ladyzhenskaya and Vershik [82] . We will derive this
coordinate version later for the Euler equations.
A few years prior, in the two seminal articles [38, 39], Foiaş had proposed the
ﬁrst rigorous concept of statistical solutions of the Navie r-Stokes equations, based
on discussions with Prodi. Just like Hopf, Foiaş described t ime-parametrized prob-
ability measures {µt}t≥0on anL2based phase space for a given initial distribution
µ. Likewise, in order to formally derive an equation describi ng the evolution of these
measures, the assumption of existence of solution operator s{St}t≥0describing the
deterministic evolution was made so that naturally µtis the pushforward measure of
µalongStas in (3), which we will denote by St♯µ. However, Foiaş did not consider
their Fourier transforms but more generally´
Φ(u)dµt(u) =´
Φ(Stu)dµ(u)for a
6suitable class of functionals Φ. Then, the evolution equation ∂tu=F(t,u)dictates
d
dtˆ
Φ(u)dµt(u) =d
dtˆ
Φ(Stu)dµ(u) =ˆ
(Φ′(Stu),∂t(Stu))L2dµ(u)
=ˆ
(Φ′(Stu),F(t,Stu))L2dµ(u) =ˆ
(Φ′(u),F(t,u))L2dµt(u).
Integrating the left and the right-hand sides over some time interval[t′,t],0≤t′≤t,
yields the Foiaş-Liouville equation
ˆ
Φ(u)dµt(u) =ˆ
Φ(u)dµt′(u)+ˆt
t′ˆ
(Φ′(u),F(t,u))L2dµs(u) ds. (4)
As suggested above, the Foiaş-Prodi approach seems to be mor e general and ﬂexi-
ble as Hopf basically only considered the functionals Φ(u) = exp(i(v,u))with ﬁxed
v∈L2( /CA2). These functionals can be approximated by Foiaş’ admissibl e test func-
tionals, as noted by himself in [38], and therefore Foiaş-Pr odi statistical solutions
also solve the Hopf statistical equation.
A few years thereafter, Vishik and Fursikov introduced a diﬀ erent type of sta-
tistical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, see [83, 84]. There, they consider
single distributions on the set of solution trajectories of the Navier-Stokes equations
and show by a similar approach their existence.
A connection to the Foiaş-Prodi statistical solutions has b een drawn by Foiaş,
Rosa and Temam in [41], where they introduce a very similar ty pe of statistical
solution, labelled Vishik-Fursikov measure, but with some diﬀerences to the original
notion of Vishik and Fursikov. For example Foiaş, Rosa and Te mam suppose a
sharper type of energy inequality and show that the set of Ler ay-Hopf solutions
of the Navier-Stokes equations is already measurable, inst ead of assuming that the
Leray-Hopf solutions contain a measurable subset which car ries the measure.
Projecting these Vishik-Fursikov measures to phase space a t each time yields a
family of time-parametrized measures, which are then indee d Foiaş-Prodi statistical
solutions. It is unclear if every Foiaş-Prodi statistical s olution can be obtained in
this way.
We would also like to point out that the method of constructin g Vishik-Fursikov
measures in [41], which is based on the Krein-Milman theorem , is ﬂexible enough to
also be applied to other equations. Indeed, it has served as m otivation for Bronzi,
Mondaini and Rosa to develop an abstract framework for the th eory of statistical
solutions [6], which has also helped the last two authors of t his article construct sta-
tistical solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equation s in a fairly comprehensive
manner [85]. In this broader context, the analogue of the Vis hik-Fursikov measure
is called trajectory statistical solution and the analogue of the Foiaş-Prodi statistical
solution is labelled phase space statistical solution .
At this point, the connection to measure-valued solutions i s not really clear. A
ﬁrst such connection was drawn by Chae in [10], where he prove d that in the three-
dimensional case, Foiaş-Prodi statistical solutions of th e Navier-Stokes equations
converge in the vanishing viscosity limit to a measure-valu ed solution of the Euler
7equations, as introduced in [24]. In particular, Chae showe d that certain time-
parametrized measures on L2correspond to (generalized) Young measures.
It is still unclear whether the converse is possible, namely , if every (generalized)
Young measure corresponds to a time parametrized measure on L2. Related to
this question is the work [33] by Fjordholm, Lanthaler and Mi shra. There, they
introduce a new notion of statistical solution of hyperboli c conservation laws, based
on inﬁnite hierarchies of Young measures, which they label correlation measures . In
particular, they prove that there is a one-to-one correspon dence between correlation
measures and measures on Lpspaces.
As for the connection to measure-valued solutions, the corr elation measures are
not speciﬁcally tied to hyperbolic conservation laws and in fact, a formulation similar
to their original deﬁnition may be introduced for the Euler o r Navier-Stokes equa-
tions [37, 66, 36]. This formulation leads to an inﬁnite chai n of equations, where the
ﬁrst equation precisely demands that the ﬁrst Young measure in this hierarchy be a
measure-valued solution in the sense of DiPerna [23] (witho ut concentration part).
This has to be interpreted in the way that the correlation mea sure augments the
classical Young measure or measure-valued solutions – whic h only describe the ﬁrst
moments and one-point statistics – with all multipoint corr elations and therefore
carries more information.
For the sake of a priori distinguishing this concept of stati stical solutions from
the other ones, we will refer to them as moment based statistical solutions . In [36],
in the context of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, the se have been labelled
(inviscid) Friedmann-Keller statistical solutions . This is due to early work by Keller
and Friedmann in 1924 [61] and later considerations by Fursi kov, who also used
this term for describing moment based chains of evolution eq uations related to the
Navier-Stokes system, see e.g. [46, 47, 48, 49].
We mentioned before that there is a one-to-one corresponden ce between measures
onLpspaces and correlation measures. As the latter objects, par ametrized by time,
are considered for the notion of statistical solutions due t o Foiaş and Prodi or
more generally, the aforementioned phase space statistica l solutions, this one-to-
one correspondence allows one to compare these two notions o f statistical solutions.
It turns out in fact that in case of the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations, the two
notions of statistical solutions are equivalent. In the lat ter case, this can be found in
the recent preprint [36] due to Fjordholm, Mishra and Weber. In case of the Euler
equations, this will be proved here later, as it illustrates the main arguments but is
a bit easier, since one does not have to worry about ensuring t hat the correlation
measure or the associated measure on L2is concentrated on H1.
In Subsection 3.1, we will give the precise deﬁnition of each notion of statis-
tical solution that we mentioned in this introduction and co mpare all of them in
more detail. In the subsequent subsection, we discuss and co mpare various ways in
which statistical solutions can be constructed. Finally, i n Subsection 3.3, we will
comment more in depth on the connection between measure-val ued and statistical
solutions, and in Section 4, we develop some more thoughts an d open problems in
this direction.
82 Measure-Valued Solutions
2.1 Deﬁnitions for the Incompressible and the Isentropic Eu ler System
Let us quickly review the basics from Young measure theory ne eded for our discus-
sion.
LetΩ⊂ /CAdbe open (or Ω = /CCd) and letX⊂ /CANbe a measurable set. A
Young measure νonXwith parameters in (0,T)×Ωis deﬁned to be an element
ofL∞
w((0,T)×Ω;P(X)). Here,L∞
w((0,T)×Ω;P(X))denotes the set of weakly-*
measurable families of probability measures ν= (νt,x)(t,x)∈(0,T)×Ω, i.e. the map
(t,x)/ma√sto→ˆ
Xf(z)dνt,x(z) =:/a\}b∇acketle{tνt,x,f/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
is measurable for all functions f∈C0(X).
There is also a notion of convergence tailored to Young measu res:
We say that a sequence of measurable functions (zn)n∈ /C6from(0,T)×ΩtoX
generates the Young measure if
f(zn(·))∗⇀/a\}b∇acketle{tν(·),f/a\}b∇acket∇i}htinL∞((0,T)×Ω)
for allf∈C0(X). As a shorthand notation we will use znY⇀ν.
This notion of convergence, by deﬁnition, behaves very well under composition with
nonlinear functions, unlike weak limits. This may be the mos t important advan-
tage of using solution concepts based on Young measures for n onlinear PDEs. For
example, consider the stationary vortex sheet
u(t,x1,x2) =/braceleftigg
e1, x 2<1
2
−e1, x2>1
2,
which solves the incompressible Euler equations on the toru s /CC2. As a consequence,
for everyn∈ /C6, the functions un(t,x1,x2) :=u(nt,nx 1,nx2)are also solutions.
Moreover, (un)n∈ /C6converges weakly to zero. However, if we compose it with the
nonlinear operation f:v/ma√sto→v⊗v, the constant functions un⊗un=
1 0
0 0
clearly
have a nonzero limit.
On the other hand, it is not hard to show that
unY⇀1
2δe1+1
2δ−e1.
Since(un)n∈ /C6is uniformly bounded in L∞, we can still insert the tensor product
f:v/ma√sto→v⊗vinto the deﬁnition of Young measure convergence, which yiel ds
un⊗un=f(un)∗⇀/a\}b∇acketle{tν,f/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht=
1 0

.
9The following convergence result is essential and is a conse quence of the Banach-
Alaoglu Theorem.
Theorem 1 (Fundamental theorem of Young measure theory) .Let(un)n∈ /C6be a
sequence of maps bounded in Lp((0,T)×Ω; /CAN)for some 1≤p≤ ∞. Then, up to
a subsequence, (un)n∈ /C6generates a Young measure on /CAN.
Note that every element of L∞
w((0,T)×Ω;P(X))can be shown to be generated
by some sequence of measurable functions.
With Theorem 1 at hand we are able to introduce the notion of me asure-valued
solution. We begin with deﬁning measure-valued solutions f or the incompressible
Euler system.
Deﬁnition 1. A triple (ν,m,D)is adissipative measure-valued solution of the
incompressible Euler system (2) with initial data u0∈L2(Ω)if

As usual, the above integrals are assumed to exist as part of t he deﬁnition. When
m= 0andD= 0, we simply write νand call it an oscillation measure-valued
solution . Moreover, if an oscillation measure-valued solution νsatisﬁesνt,x=δu(t,x)
for someu∈L2((0,T)×Ω; /CAd), this boils down to the usual deﬁnition of ubeing a
weak solution.
The corresponding notion of measure-valued solution for th e isentropic Euler
system is deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 2. A triple (ν,m,D)is adissipative measure-valued solution of the
isentropic Euler system (1) with adiabatic exponent 1< γ <∞and initial data

Again, the above integrals are assumed to exist as part of the deﬁnition. When m= 0
andD= 0, we simply write νand call it an oscillation measure-valued solution .
Moreover, if an oscillation measure-valued solution νsatisﬁesνt,x=δ(ρ(t,x),u(t,x))for
some(ρ,u)∈L1((0,T)×Ω;[0,∞)× /CAd), this reduces to the usual deﬁnition of (ρ,u)
being a weak solution.
2.2 Existence of Measure-Valued Solutions
One of the most striking advantages of the notion of measure- valued solution is
that for every L2-initial data a corresponding dissipative measure-valued solution
is known to exist globally. This is still unknown for weak sol utions. If one drops
the requirement of energy dissipativity, then at least for t he incompressible Euler
system weak solutions exist for every initial data, cf. [86] .
Theorem 2. Letu0∈L2(Ω)or(ρ0,u0)∈(Lγ×L2)(Ω). Then there exists a dissi-
pative measure-valued solution of the incompressible Eule r system with initial data
u0, and in the compressible case there exists a dissipative mea sure-valued solution of
the isentropic Euler system with initial data (ρ0,u0).
Proof. We will only prove the case of the isentropic Euler system whe n energy admis-
sible weak solutions of the compressible Navier-Stokes sys tem are known to exist,
e.g. whenγ >3
2andd= 3by the existence theory from [31]. The incompress-
ible case follows similarly, where weak Navier-Stokes solu tions exist by the work of
Leray-Hopf [67, 56]. The other cases for the isentropic Eule r equations are covered
by [28].
So, let(ρ0,u0)∈(Lγ×L2)(Ω)and let(ρn,un)be the corresponding energy
admissible weak solutions of the compressible Navier-Stok es system with viscosity
parameterαn→0. This means that (ρn,un)satisfy
∂t(ρnun)+div(ρnun⊗un)+∇(ργ
n) =αndivS(∇un)
∂tρn+div(ρnun) = 0

Here,Eddenotes the identity matrix in ddimensions and κ,ηare some ﬁxed positive

The uniform energy bound implies that (ρn)n∈ /C6isL∞

n)n∈ /C6
isL∞
tL2
x-bounded. Thus, Theorem 1 implies that there exists a subseq uence (which
we will not relabel) that generates a Young measure ν.
When we consider (ρnun⊗un)and(ργ
n)Ed, we observe that these sequences are
bounded in L∞((0,T);L1(Ω))but may not be bounded. Therefore, the functions
(ρ,√ρu)/ma√sto→ρu⊗uandρ/ma√sto→ργmay not be admissible test functions in the deﬁnition
of Young measure generation, and accordingly the terms
ρnun⊗un−/a\}b∇acketle{tνt,x,ρu⊗u/a\}b∇acket∇i}htand(ρn)γEd−/a\}b∇acketle{tνt,x,ργEd/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
may not converge weakly-* to zero. On the other hand, we may in terpret the
above terms as bounded Radon-measures on [0,T]×Ω. Then we obtain (not rela-
beled) subsequences converging weakly-* in the sense of Rad on-measures to some
mρu⊗u,mργ∈ M([0,T]×Ω; /CAd×d), respectively. Standard arguments from measure
theory imply from the L∞
tL1
x-bound a disintegration of the form
mρu⊗u( dxdt) =mρu⊗u
t( dx)⊗dt,
mργ( dxdt) =mργ
t( dx)⊗dt,
where(mρu⊗u
t),(mργ
t)are uniformly bounded families of measures in M(Ω; /CAd×d).
We deﬁne m:=mρu⊗u+mργ. Then the disintegration measures also add up,
i.e.mt=mρu⊗u
t+mργ
t.
We also deﬁne the dissipation defect Din terms of the trace of mas the uniformly

for a.e.t∈(0,T). Since both mρu⊗u

semideﬁnite symmetric matrices, any matrix norm is equival ent to the trace and so
there exists some C >0such that
|mt|(Ω)≤C·D(t)
for a.e.t∈(0,T). In particular, D≥0. We will now show that (ν,m,D)is a
dissipative measure-valued solution.
Note that i), ii) and iii) in Deﬁnition 2 are satisﬁed by const ruction. Since
(ρn)n∈ /C6isL∞

2.3 Weak-Strong Uniqueness
Although measure-valued solutions are a very weak notion of solution, they satisfy
a certain uniqueness property. Clearly, there exist initia l data with non-unique
measure-valued solutions. Even weak solutions are already not unique. However,
if the initial data gives rise to a classical solution, then e very dissipative measure-
valued solution corresponding to this initial data is alrea dy equal to the classical
solution. This is called weak-strong uniqueness . As a consequence, initial data
giving rise to laminar ﬂow cannot generate turbulent ﬂow.
For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the torus /CCdas the space domain.
14Theorem 3. Let the initial data u0give rise to a strong incompressible solution U∈
C1([0,T]× /CCd)and an incompressible dissipative measure-valued solutio n(ν,m,D).
Then(ν,m,D) = (δU,0,0).
Theorem 4. Let the initial data (ρ0,u0)give rise to a strong compressible solution
(r,U)∈C1([0,T]× /CCd), withr>0everywhere, and also to a compressible dissipative
measure-valued solution (ν,m,D).
Then(ν,m,D) =/parenleftbig
δ(r,U),0,0/parenrightbig
.
We only prove the compressible case, since the proof in the in compressible case
is simpler and follows from the same arguments. For a proof of the incompressible
case, see e.g. [5] or [87].
As the astute reader will ﬁnd, the exclusion of vacuum in the s trong solution
(r>0) allows us to raise rto a negative power in the proof. Generally, weak-strong
uniqueness is not known to hold in the presence of vacuum, but speciﬁc appearances
of vacuum can be tolerated [54].
For a strong solution (r,U)with initial data (r0,U0)and a measure-valued solu-
tion(ν,m,D)with initial data (ρ0,u0), deﬁne the relative energy as

By the strong convexity of ρ/ma√sto→ργ, we directly infer the weak-strong uniqueness
property from the concept of weak-strong stability , which we formulate as follows.
Theorem 5. Let the initial data (ρ0,u0)give rise to a compressible dissipative
measure-valued solution (ν,m,D)and let the initial data (r0,U0)give rise to a strong
compressible solution (r,U)∈C1([0,T]× /CCd).
Then there exists a constant C >0such that
Erel(ν,m,D|r,U)(t)≤eCT/ba∇dbl∇U/ba∇dblC([0,T]× /CCd)Erel(ν,m,D|r,U)(0)
for a.e.t∈(0,T).

2.4 Measure-Valued Singular Limits
For the existence of measure-valued solutions, we have seen that the viscosity limit
corresponding to ﬁxed initial data generates a measure-val ued solution. Moreover,
every Young measure can be generated by some sequence of meas urable functions.
So, a natural question to ask is whether every measure-value d solution might come
from a sequence of (approximate) weak solutions, e.g. a vani shing viscosity sequence.
Other possibilities might be the limit of numerical schemes , low Mach limits, or
limits of weak solutions. Note that it is of course not includ ed in the deﬁnition of
measure-valued solutions that they are generated by approx imate solutions.
In the incompressible case, it is a surprising and highly non -trivial fact that
every measure-valued solution comes from a sequence of weak solutions, cf. [79] for
a proof.
17Theorem 6. Letνbe an incompressible dissipative measure-valued solution on /CAd
with initial data u0∈L2( /CAd). Then there exists a sequence of energy admissible
weak solutions (un)n∈ /C6with initial data (u0
n)n∈ /C6such thatu0
n→u0inL2( /CAd)and
such that (un)n∈ /C6generatesν, i.e.
unY⇀ν.
In fact, this result of Székelyhidi-Wiedemann uses a diﬀere nt formulation of
concentration measures, see [79]. But we do not want to go dee per into this topic.
The surprising consequence, anyway, of the above theorem is that incompress-
ible measure-valued solutions and weak solutions contain e ssentially the same in-
formation although measure-valued solutions are an a prior i much weaker notion of
solution, since only the ﬁrst and second moment of the measur e are constrained.
So, what about the compressible situation? In fact, the case of the compressible
Euler system is quite diﬀerent and also more complicated. As a preparation we have
the following meta-result.
Theorem 7. For space dimension d≥2, not every oscillation measure-valued so-
lution of the compressible Euler equations comes from a sequ ence of weak solutions.
This has ﬁrst been observed in [14], where a constant measure -valued solution
consisting of two Dirac measures is constructed such that it cannot be generated by
weak solutions. The idea of [14] has been developed further i n [52] to obtain the
result that there exists even deterministic initial data, w hich evolves classically up
to some ﬁnite time and then bursts into actually inﬁnitely ma ny oscillation measure-
valued solutions that cannot be generated by weak solutions .
The idea of the proof for both versions of the above theorem re lies on a compensated
compactness rigidity argument in the spirit of Ball and Jame s [1]. For this, the
rank-one connectedness in [1] corresponds to the wave-cone connectedness of the
underlying Young measures. Here, we consider the calculus o f variations framework
oflinear homogeneous diﬀerential operators Aoforderk∈ /C6, i.e.
A=/summationdisplay
|α|=kAα∂α
withAαconstant coeﬃcient matrices acting on the state space /CAN. This framework
was pioneered by Tartar, cf. [80]. The corresponding Fourie r symbol of Ais deﬁned
forξ∈ /CAdas
A(ξ) =/summationdisplay
|α|=kξαAα.
Thewave-cone ofAis deﬁned as
ΛA=/uniondisplay
|ξ|=1kerA(ξ).
18Moreover, two vectors z1,z2∈ /CANare called wave-cone connected if
z1−z2∈ΛA.
Now the compressible Euler system can be relaxed to a linear h omogeneous system
of PDEs of order one. The corresponding linear operator is ob tained via simple
substitution of the non-linear terms by new variables. We ca ll this the linearly
relaxed Euler system
∂tm+divM+∇Q= 0,
∂tρ+divm= 0
for the variables (ρ,m,M,Q )∈[0,∞)× /CAd×Sd
0× /CA, whereSd
0denotes the symmetric
(d×d)-matrices with zero trace. The relaxed system now directly c orresponds to a
linear homogeneous diﬀerential operator AEof order one. The transition from the
non-linear to the linearized system is achieved through the lift map
Θ: (ρ,m)/ma√sto→/parenleftbigg
ρ,m,m⊗m
ρ−|m|2
ρdEd,ργ+|m|2
ρd/parenrightbigg
,
whereEdis the unit matrix in ddimensions. Here, for convenience, we used the
momentum m=ρuas a primitive variable instead of the velocity u. Anyway, this
lift mapΘencodes the non-linear pointwise constraints that togethe r with the linear
operator AEyields the non-linear compressible Euler system.
Another consequence of considering the linearized Euler sy stemAEis the fol-
lowing necessary condition, see [14] and [53]. This follows from the seminal work of
Fonseca-Müller [44] which is a generalization of the work of Kinderlehrer-Pedregal
[62, 63]. In fact, one may also infer Theorem 7 from Theorem 8.
Theorem 8. Supposeνis a Young measure which is generated by a uniformly
bounded sequence of energy admissible weak solutions (ρn,mn)n∈ /C6of the compress-
ible Euler system over (0,T)× /CCd. Further, assume that the initial data satisfy
(ρ0
n,m0
n)→(ρ0,m0)inLγ×L2and assume that there exists η>0such thatρn≥η
for alln∈ /C6.
Thenνis a dissipative oscillation measure-valued solution with initial data (ρ0,m0)
and the Jensen-type condition
/a\}b∇acketle{tΘ♯ν,f/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥QAEf(/a\}b∇acketle{tΘAEν,id/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht)
holds on a set of full measure and for all f∈C( /CAN).
We need to clarify some notation:
Thelifted measure Θ♯νis deﬁned as the pushforward measure
/a\}b∇acketle{tΘ♯ν,f/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/a\}b∇acketle{tν,f◦Θ/a\}b∇acket∇i}htforf∈C( /CAN).
As a consequence, νis an oscillation measure-valued solution of the compressi ble
Euler system if and only if the corresponding lifted measure satisﬁes the linear
constraint
AE/a\}b∇acketle{tΘ♯ν,id/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht= 0.
19Moreover, for any linear homogeneous diﬀerential operator Awe say that a function
f∈C( /CAN)isA-quasiconvex if for allz∈ /CAN
ˆ/CCdf(z+w(x)) dx≥f(z)
holds for all w∈C∞( /CCd, /CAN)withAw= 0and´/CCdw(x) dx= 0. Note that for
A= 0this corresponds to fbeing just convex.
For a given function f∈C( /CAN), the largest A-quasiconvex function below fis

LetBbe apotential operator forA, i.e. the linear homogeneous diﬀerential operator

A direct consequence of the above deﬁnitions is that for all f∈C( /CAN)andq >0
it holds that
QAf≤Qq
Bf≤f.
See, e.g., [53] and [44] for more on (truncated) quasiconvex envelopes.
The above Theorem 8 suggests the following selection criter ion for measure-
valued solutions:
A measure-valued solution may be discarded as unphysical if it is not generated
by a sequence of weak solutions.
In fact, the selection via singular limits is a common way to i dentify unphysical
solutions, see [2] for the vanishing viscosity case and [50] for the case of low Mach
number limits.
Let us quickly review the incompressible situation. One can also derive a nec-
essary Jensen condition in this case. However, since for the corresponding linear
operator every quasiconvex function is already convex, thi s Jensen condition is triv-
ially fulﬁlled by the classical Jensen inequality, cf. Rema rk 4 in [14]. Therefore, we
do not get a contradiction from the fact that every incompres sible measure-valued
solution is generated by weak solutions.
20We have learned that compressible measure-valued solution s which can be gen-
erated by weak solutions necessarily need to satisfy a Jense n-type condition. But
what about suﬃcient conditions? It turns out that a related J ensen condition among
some other structural conditions only on the measure are suﬃ cient. This is stated
in the following theorem from [53].
Theorem 9. LetT >0andd≥2. Letνbe a dissipative oscillation measure-
valued solution of the compressible Euler system on (0,T)× /CCdwith initial data

Here,BEdenotes the second order potential of the relaxed Euler syst emAE
which is constructed in [51].
We want to give here only the idea of the proof:
Starting from the Jensen condition for the lifted measure, w e obtain a sequence
of weak solutions of the relaxed system generating Θ♯ν. This follows from a result
in the spirit of the Fonseca-Müller characterization from [ 50]. A truncation method
21from [51] can be used to obtain a generating sequence that is s uitable for applying
convex integration methods. The particular convex integra tion result we use is from
[20]. In this way, the sequence of relaxed solutions generat ingΘ♯νgives a sequence
of true energy admissible weak solutions generating the mea sureν. This means, by
convex integration we can transition from the linear back to the non-linear regime.
Now also the condition of space dimension d≥2is justiﬁed, as convex integration
methods do not work for d= 1. Moreover, the condition γ= 1 +2
dstems also
from the usage of the speciﬁc compressible convex integrati on scheme we use. The
main advantage of this case is that the generalized pressure Qequals the energy
density1
2|m|2
ρ+1
γ−1ργup to the constant factord
2, which is crucial for the proofs.
Note, however, that this particular choice of γcorresponds physically to the case of
monoatomic gases.
Let us brieﬂy comment on the gap between the above necessary a nd suﬃcient
conditions for generating compressible measure-valued so lutions by weak solutions.
When we ignore energy admissibility, the only true gap betwe en the necessary
and suﬃcient Jensen and barycenter conditions arises from t he breakdown of the
Calderón-Zygmund inequality in the case of L∞, which results in the diﬀerent qua-
siconvex envelopes we used. It is unclear for now how to treat this very subtle
point.
If we consider the conditions that lead to energy admissibil ity, we observe that
the assumption Q=/angbracketleftig
ν,1
d|m|2
ρ+ργ/angbracketrightig
is way too restrictive as a general dissipative
measure-valued solution may violate this. For example take a solution consisting of
two Dirac measures supported at weak solutions with diﬀeren t energies. Moreover,
the continuity condition on the energy of νapparently is also very restrictive. How-
ever, this is needed for technical reasons in the proof, whic h cannot be overcome in
an obvious way.
We want to give also a very heuristic argument of why the incom pressible and
compressible situations are diﬀerent:
It is easier to ﬁnd true solutions generating the measure if t he convex integration
scheme is more ﬂexible. This, in turn, corresponds to a large wave-cone, since we can
ﬁnd solutions of the relaxed system more easily then. A large wave-cone, however,
implies that more functions wsatisfyAw= 0, and hence qualify as test functions
in the deﬁnition of A-quasiconvexity. Thus, the diﬀerence between a function an d
its corresponding A-quasiconvex envelope is larger. So, the A-quasiconvex envelope
is relatively small.
Note that for the incompressible system the associated wave -cone is large com-
pared to the wave-cone corresponding to the compressible sy stem. Therefore the
Jensen condition is easier to satisfy in the incompressible case, in fact, it is void.
3 Statistical Notions of Solution
3.1 Deﬁnitions and Comparisons Between Diﬀerent Notions
In the following, we work on the two-dimensional torus /CC2and some ﬁnite but
arbitrary time interval [0,T], and denote by Uthe set of all weak solutions of the
22incompressible Euler equations in C([0,T];Hw)which satisfy the energy inequality
1
2ˆ/CC2|u(x,t)|2dx≤1
2ˆ/CC2|u(x,0)|2dx (5)
for almost every 0≤t≤T. Here,Hwis the set of L2( /CC2; /CA2)-vector ﬁelds that are
weakly divergence-free, equipped with the weak topology, s o thatt/ma√sto→´/CC2u(x,t)·
v(x) dxis continuous in [0,T]for eachv∈L2( /CC2; /CA2). In fact, this implies – by
weak lower semicontinuity of the norm – that (5) is satisﬁed f oreveryt∈[0,T].
We introduce the time evaluation mappings {Πt}0≤t≤T, whereΠt:C([0,T];Hw)→
Hw,u/ma√sto→u(t).
For the considerations to follow, we note the general fact th at on Polish spaces
such asH, the Borel- σ-algebra generated by the weak and strong topologies coin-
cide. We will therefore for purely measure-theoretic consi derations and notations
not distinguish between HandHw.
Deﬁnition 3 (Trajectory statistical solutions) .Letµbe a Borel probability measure
onHsuch that ˆ
H/ba∇dblu0/ba∇dbl2
L2dµ(u0)<∞.
Atrajectory statistical solution of the (2D incompressible) Euler equations or U-
trajectory statistical solution with initial distribution µis a Borel probability measure
µonC([0,T];Hw)such that
i) there exists a Borel measurable subset V ⊂ U such thatµ(V) = 1;
ii) the initial data is attained in the sense that the pushfor ward measure Π0♯µis
equal toµ;
iii)µsatisﬁes an energy inequality in the sense that for every 0≤t≤T
ˆ
C([0,T];Hw)/ba∇dblu(t)/ba∇dbl2
L2dµ(u)≤ˆ
H/ba∇dblu0/ba∇dbl2
L2dµ(u0). (6)
For the deﬁnition of phase space statistical solutions, we n eed an appropriate
class of test functionals T. Motivated by [40, 41, 6], we let Tbe the set of functionals
Φ:H→ /CAsuch that for some k∈ /C6andL >2, there exists φ∈C1
c( /CAk)and
g1,...,gk∈HL( /CC2; /CA2)∩H=:HLsuch that
Φ(u) =φ((u,g1)L2,...,(u,gk)L2)
for allu∈H. In particular T ⊂Cb(Hw). Such functionals Φare also Fréchet-
diﬀerentiable by the chain rule and the Fréchet derivative Φ′(u)at someu∈Hcan
be identiﬁed with the function/summationtextk
j=1∂jφ((u,g1)L2,...,(u,gk)L2)gjinHL.
AsL >2, we note that as we consider the 2D case, we have the embedding
HL֒→C1,β( /CC2; /CA2)for some 0< β < 1so that∇Φ′(u)∈C0,β( /CC2; /CA2)⊂
L∞( /CC2; /CA2). Foru∈Handg1,...,gk∈HL, we will also frequently use the no-
tation(u,g)k
L2:= ((u,g1)L2,...,(u,gk)L2)∈ /CAk.
23The functionals in Tare called cylindrical test functionals since to each Borel mea-
sureµonHone may uniquely associate the generalized moments {´
HΦ(u)dµ(u) :
Φ∈ T }.This may for instance be proved using the Stone-Weierstrass theorem [6,
Remark 2.7] or a monotone class argument.
In light of (4), which was formally derived in the introducti on, we make the
following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4 (Statistical solutions in phase space) .Letµbe a Borel probability
measure on Hsuch thatˆ
H/ba∇dblu0/ba∇dbl2
L2dµ(u0)<∞.
Aphase space statistical solution of the (2D incompressible) Euler equations with

thatµ0=µand
i) for every ϕ∈Cb(Hw)

Remark 1. We have chosen here Hwas phase space for our notion of phase space
statistical solutions and also deﬁned trajectory statisti cal solutions as measures on
C([0,T];Hw). As in [85], it would likewise be possible and natural to inst ead use
some negative order Sobolev space H−s( /CC2; /CA2),s>2. We chose Hwhere, as it is
more natural for the comparison to moment-based statistica l solutions that shall be
introduced later.
The following theorem shows in what way trajectory statisti cal solutions corre-
spond to phase-space statistical solutions. It can be prove d as in [41, Chapter 3]
(see also [6, 85]).
Theorem 10. Letµbe a Borel probability measure on Hand letµbe a trajectory
statistical solution of the Euler equations with initial di stributionµ. Then the family
of pushforward measures {µt:= Πt♯µ}0≤t≤Tis a statistical solution in phase space
of the Euler equations with initial distribution µ.
24At this point, let us also describe the Hopf statistical equa tion more rigorously.
As in our considerations for deriving the Foiaş-Liouville e quation (4), given a Borel
probability measure on H, we assume the existence of solution operators {St}0≤t≤T
such thatt/ma√sto→Stu0∈C([0,T];Hw)is a weak solution of the Euler equations with
initial data u0∈H. Then, the evolution of µis naturally described by the pushfor-
ward measures µt:=St♯µ,0≤t≤T, onHw. Their characteristic functionals are
given by
F(t,v) =ˆ
Hexp(i(u,v)L2)dµt(u) =ˆ
Hexp(i(Stu0,v)L2)dµ(u0)
and the evolution of Fcan be described as follows
∂tF(t,v) =ˆ
Hi(∂tStu0,v)L2exp(i(Stu0,v)L2)dµ(u0)
=ˆ
Hi(Stu0⊗Stu0,∇v)L2exp(i(Stu0,v)L2)dµ(u0)
=ˆ
Hi(u⊗u,∇v)L2exp(i(u,v)L2)dµt(u)(10)
for a.e.0≤t≤Tandv∈HL. The right-hand side is well-deﬁned if µthas ﬁnite
second moment with respect to /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblL2. We denote the set of characteristic functionals
of Borel probability measures on Hwith this property by C. We then introduce an
operatorBonC, such that B(χ):H→H−L:= (HL)′is given by
(B(χ)w,v)H−L,HL=ˆ
Hi(u⊗u,∇v)L2exp(i(u,w)L2)dµ(u)
for allw∈Handv∈HLandχ∈ Cbeing the characteristic functional of a measure
µ.
Then we may rewrite (10) as
∂tF(t,v) = (BF(t,v),v)H−L,HL, (11)
which we call the Hopf statistical equation in functional form of the (2D incom-
pressible) Euler equations. Alternatively, closer to Hopf ’s original formal consid-
erations, one can study the coordinate form . By this, we mean the description in
terms of Fourier coeﬃcients with respect to some ﬁxed orthon ormal basis of H, say
(ϕn)n∈ /C6⊂C∞( /CC2)∩Hin our case. We denote the Fourier coeﬃcients of some v∈H
byˆvn:= (v,ϕn)L2,n∈ /C6, and more speciﬁcally, denote the Fourier coeﬃcients of
Stu0bywn(t,u0), so thatStu0=/summationtext∞

F(t,v) =ˆ

j,k,m=1−iajkmˆvm∂ˆvjˆvkF(t,v) (13)
is called Hopf statistical equation in coordinate form of th e (2D incompressible)
Euler equations.
As is probably apparent here, it is quite inconvenient to giv e precise meaning
to either the functional or the coordinate form of the Hopf st atistical equation.
Due to the similarity in the derivation of the Foiaş-Liouvil le equation and statistical
solutions in phase space, it might not come as a surprise that the latter actually lead
to solutions of the Hopf statistical equation. We state the f ollowing result for our
situation of the Euler equations, which is analogous to the c onsiderations by Foiaş in
case of the Navier-Stokes equations [39, Section 9, Theorem 1], [40, Sections V.1.3,
V.2.4]. See also [82, Theorem 2] by Ladyzhenskaya and Vershi k for the coordinate
version.
Theorem 11. Letµbe a Borel probability measure on Hsatisfying
ˆ
H/ba∇dblu0/ba∇dbl2
L2dµ(u0)<∞.
Suppose that {µt}0≤t≤Tis a statistical solution of the Euler equations in phase
space with initial distribution µand denote the characteristic functionals of µand
{µt}0≤t≤TbyFandF={F(t,·)}0≤t≤Trespectively.
ThenFsatisﬁes the functional version of the Hopf statistical equ ation in the
sense that
F(t,v) =F(v)+ˆt
0(BF(s,v),v)H−L,HLds (14)
for allv∈HLand every 0≤t≤T.
The main part in the proof of Theorem 11, which we are omitting here, is that for
ﬁxedv∈HL, the class Tof admissible functionals in the formulation of statistica l
solutions in phase-space can be extended to also include u/ma√sto→exp(i(u,v)L2). This can
be done by a standard truncation argument and a complexiﬁcat ion of the involved
spacesHandHL.
26For the third notion of statistical solution that we mention ed in the introduction,
we ﬁrst deﬁne correlation measures as introduced in [33], but only consider the L2
setting. We introduce the sets of (time-dependent) Carathé odory functions
Hk
0( /CC2; /CA2) :=L1(( /CC2)k;C0(( /CA2)k)),
Hk
0([0,T], /CC2; /CA2) :=L1([0,T]×( /CC2)k;C0(( /CA2)k)))
and their respective dual spaces
Hk∗
0( /CC2; /CA2) :=L∞
w(( /CC2)k;M(( /CA2)k))),
Hk∗
0([0,T], /CC2; /CA2) :=L∞
w([0,T]×( /CC2)k;M(( /CA2)k)))
for everyk∈ /C6, whereMdenotes the set of all bounded Radon measures on the
respective space. The subscript wdenotes weak-* measurability as in Section 2.1.
Deﬁnition 5. Acorrelation measure is a collection ν= (ν1,ν2,...)of mapsνk∈
Hk∗
0( /CC2; /CA2)satisfying the following properties:
1. Weak-* measurability: Every νkis a Young measure, i.e., for every f∈
C0(( /CA2)k), the mapping
x/ma√sto→ /a\}b∇acketle{tνk
x,f(ξ)/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht:=ˆ
( /CA2)kf(ξ)dνk

2.L2-boundedness:´/CC2/a\}b∇acketle{tν1
x,|ξ|2/a\}b∇acket∇i}htdx<∞.
3. Symmetry: For every permutation πof{1,...,k}andf∈C0(( /CA2)k), we have
/a\}b∇acketle{tνk
π(x),f(π(ξ))/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht:=/a\}b∇acketle{tνk

=/a\}b∇acketle{tνk
x,f(ξ)/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
for a.e.x∈( /CC2)k.
4. Consistency: Let f∈C0(( /CA2)k)and suppose that there exists some g∈
C0(( /CA2)k−1)such thatf(ξ1,...,ξk) =g(ξ1,...,ξk−1)for allξ∈( /CA2)k. Then

for a.e.x∈( /CC2)k.

tinuity

x,y,|ξ1−ξ2|2/a\}b∇acket∇i}htdydx.
Each mapping νkis called a correlation marginal and the set of all correlation mea-
sures will be denoted by L2( /CC2; /CA2).
27The interpretation of a correlation measure νis to describe all multipoint-
correlations of a ﬂow, that is: Suppose Fis a set of velocity ﬁelds, V1,...,Vk⊂ /CA2
are measurable and x= (x1,...,xk)∈( /CC2)k, then
νk
x(V1×...×Vk) =Probability/parenleftbig
{u∈F:u(x1)∈V1,...,u(xk)∈Vk}/parenrightbig
.
This will be made more precise in Theorem 12.
For time-dependent correlation measures, we make the follo wing adaptations as
in [34, 36].
Deﬁnition 6. Atime-dependent correlation measure is a collection ν= (ν1,ν2,...)
of mapsνk∈ Hk∗
0([0,T], /CC2; /CA2)satisfying the following properties:
1.(ν1
t,ν2
t,...)∈ L2( /CC2; /CA2)for a.e.0≤t≤T.
2.L2-boundedness: esssup0≤t≤T´/CC2/a\}b∇acketle{tν1

3. Diagonal continuity:
lim
r→0ˆT
0ω2
r(ν2
t) dt= 0. (15)
The set of all such time-dependent correlation measures wil l be denoted by L2([0,T], /CC2; /CA2).
The simplest examples of correlation measures are the so-ca lledatomic corre-
lation measures , where we consider a given function u∈L∞(0,T;L2( /CC2; /CA2))and
deﬁneν= (ν1,ν2,...)as the hierarchy of product measures
νk
t,x1,...,xk=δu(t,x1)⊗...⊗δu(t,xk).
In fact, in [33] it was argued that as a consequence of the diag onal continuity,
given a Young measure {νx}x∈ /CC2, the sequence of product measures (νx,νx⊗νy,...)
constitutes a correlation measure if and only if {νx}x∈ /CC2is a Dirac Young measure.
Analogously to [33] in the case of hyperbolic conservation l aws, we now derive a
notion of statistical solution of the Euler equations based on the evolution of cor-
relation measures or, in other words, the evolution of momen ts. Evolving moments
translates into evolving products in the state space /CA2. For this, we loosely use the
notion of tensor product spaces ( /CA2)⊗kfor everyk∈ /C6. On( /CA2)⊗k, the product :
is deﬁned by
η:ζ:= (η1·ζ1)...(ηk·ζk)∈ /CA (16)
for allη=η1⊗...⊗ηk,ζ=ζ1⊗...⊗ζk∈( /CA2)⊗k. This is well-deﬁned due to the
multilinearity of the right-hand side in (16). Similarly, w e deﬁne:in( /CA2×2)⊗kand
mixed tensor product spaces between /CA2and /CA2×2, where we then interpret the dot
product·as the Frobenius inner product between matrices.
Now suppose u: [0,T]× /CC2→ /CA2is a classical solution of the Euler equations with
28pressurep: [0,T]× /CC2→ /CAand initial datum u(0) =u0∈C1( /CC2; /CA2)∩H. We
formally evolve the following tensor product using the prod uct rule:

i=1u(t,x1)⊗...⊗[div(u(t,xi)⊗u(t,xi))+∇p(t,xi)]⊗...⊗u(t,xk).(17)
In order to interpret this equation in the sense of distribut ions, letθ∈C1
c([0,T))
andg1,...,gk∈HLand set
g(x) =g1(x1)⊗...⊗gk(xk), x= (x1,...,xk)∈( /CC2)k.
Then, from (17), we further derive

(18)
where∇xig(x) =g1(x1)⊗...⊗∇xigi(xi)⊗...⊗gk(xk)for everyi= 1,...,k.
Assuming that uis inL∞(0,T;H)andu0is inH, we now consider the atomic
correlation measures ν= (ν1,ν2,...),ν= (ν1,ν2,...)given by
νk
t,x=δu(t,x1)⊗...⊗δu(t,xk),νk
x=δu0(x1)⊗...⊗δu0(xk)
for allk∈ /C6,0≤t≤Tandx= (x1,...,xk)∈( /CC2)k. Then we may rewrite (18) as
−ˆT

( /CC2)k/a\}b∇acketle{tνk

In the following, we will usually write the factors which do n ot depend on ξin
/a\}b∇acketle{tνx,.../a\}b∇acket∇i}htoutside of the brackets.
We now notice that the solution no longer explicitly appears in (19) and we
may use it as a deﬁning equation. However, it comes at the cost of needing strong
29integrability conditions in order for (19) to be well-deﬁne d in general. Following
[36], we therefore introduce two additional classes of func tions, similar to Hk
0, which
we will also use later in Theorem 17.
For everyk∈ /C6,α∈ {0,1}kandx∈( /CC2)k, we deﬁne α:= (1−α1,...,1−αk),
|α|:=α1+...+αkandxα∈( /CC2)|α|consists of those entries xiofxfor whichαi= 1.
Moreover, for every i= 1,...,k, we deﬁne ˆxi:= (x1,...,xi−1,xi+1,...,xk)∈( /CC2)k−1.
Then, for every k∈ /C6, the space Hk,2([0,T], /CC2; /CA2)consists of all measurable
functionsf: [0,T]×( /CC2)k×( /CA2)k→ /CAsuch thatξ/ma√sto→f(t,x,ξ)is continuous for
a.e.(t,x)∈[0,T]×( /CC2)kand

L1(( /CC2)0) = /CA).
ThenHk,2
1([0,T], /CC2; /CA2)is the subspace of functions f∈ Hk,2([0,T], /CC2; /CA2)
which satisfy a Lipschitz condition in the sense that for som er>0and non-negative
h∈ Hk−1,2([0,T], /CC2; /CA2),˜h∈ Hk,2([0,T], /CC2; /CA2),ψ∈L∞(0,T), we have

i=1ψ(t)|ξi−ζi|max{|ξi|,|ζi|}h(t,ˆxi,ˆξi)+O(|x−y|)˜h(t,x,ξ)
(20)
for allx∈( /CC2)k,y∈Br(x),ξ,ζ∈( /CA2)k. In the time-independent case, Hk,2( /CC2; /CA2)
is deﬁned analogously in an obvious manner. Aside from these deﬁnitions, we
will not further discuss these function spaces. We note that every integrand in
(19) lies in Hk,2([0,T], /CC2; /CA2)(recall that HL֒→C1,β( /CC2; /CA2)) and we will say
that a correlation measure νhas integrable H·,2moments if for every k∈ /C6and

c([0,T))and
g(x) =g1(x1)⊗...⊗gk(xk),x= (x1,...,xk)∈( /CC2)k,whereg1,...,gk∈HL.
The integrand in (21) can be thought of as the square of the div ergence. Property
i) in the above deﬁnition is therefore a weak divergence-fre e condition as will be made
precise in Lemma 1.
Given a function u∈L∞(0,T;H)andu0∈H, it is not hard to see that uis a weak
solution of the Euler equations with initial datum u0if and only if the corresponding
atomic correlation measure (δu(t,x),δu(t,x)⊗δu(t,y),...)is a moment-based statistical
solution with initial correlation measure (δu0(x),δu0(x)⊗δu0(y),...). This holds since
fork= 1, (19) is just the weak formulation of the Euler equations, (2 2) is equivalent
to the energy inequality and we note that any weak solution u∈L∞(0,T;H)of
the Euler equations is already in C([0,T];Hw)(or has a representative therein to be
precise).
We now move on to show an equivalence between phase space stat istical solutions
as in Deﬁnition 4 and the just introduced moment based statis tical solutions in
Deﬁnition 7. In the context of the Navier-Stokes equations, this was shown in [36].
The essential tool is the main theorem for correlation measu res [33, Theorem 2.7],
of which we will state the more general time-dependent versi on here [34, Theorem
2.20].
Theorem 12. Letν∈ L2([0,T], /CC2; /CA2)be a time-dependent correlation measure.
Up to a Lebesgue null set, there exists a family {µt}0≤t≤Tof Borel probability mea-
sures onL2( /CC2; /CA2)such that
i) the map
t/ma√sto→ˆ
L2ˆ
( /CC2)kh(x,u(x)) dxdµt(u) (23)
is measurable for all h∈ Hk
0( /CC2; /CA2),
ii) the second moments w.r.t. /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblL2are uniformly bounded in time, i.e.
esssup
0≤t≤Tˆ
L2/ba∇dblu/ba∇dbl2
L2dµt(u)<∞, (24)
iii) the identity
ˆ
( /CC2)k/a\}b∇acketle{tνk
t,h(x,ξ)/a\}b∇acket∇i}htdx=ˆ
L2ˆ
( /CC2)kh(x,u(x)) dxdµt(u) (25)
holds for a.e. t∈[0,T], everyh∈ Hk
0( /CC2; /CA2), and allk∈ /C6.
Conversely, for every family {µt}0≤t≤Tsatisfying i) and ii), there is a unique corre-
lation measure ν∈ L2([0,T], /CC2; /CA2)satisfying iii).
We may then formulate the equivalence between moment based a nd phase-space
statistical solutions of the Euler equations as follows.
31Theorem 13. Letµ,{µt}0≤t≤Tbe Borel probability measures on Hand suppose that
there exists R>0such that
suppµ,suppµt⊂BH
R (26)
for a.e.t∈[0,T]. Also, let {µt}0≤t≤Tsatisfy (24)and one of the equivalent mea-
surability conditions (23)or(7)(see Lemma 2).
If we consider the associated correlation measures ν∈ L2( /CC2; /CA2)andν∈ L2([0,T], /CC2; /CA2),
thenνis a moment based statistical solution of the Euler equation s with initial cor-
relation measure νif and only if (after redeﬁning on a Lebesgue null set) {µt}0≤t≤T
is a phase space statistical solution of the Euler equations with initial distribution µ.
Remark 2. Phase space statistical solutions of the Euler equations wh ich come
from trajectory statistical solutions with initial distri bution of bounded support in
Hhave uniformly bounded support in Has a consequence of the energy inequality.
Generally, this is unknown and may not need to be the case.
It can be proved that a Borel probability measure on L2( /CC2; /CA2)being concen-
trated on the closed, hence measurable, subset HofL2( /CC2; /CA2)is equivalent to the
corresponding correlation measure satisfying (21).
Lemma 1. ([66, Lemma 3.1]) Let µbe a Borel probability measure on L2( /CC2; /CA2),
corresponding to a correlation measure ν∈ L2( /CC2; /CA2). Thenµis concentrated on
Hif and only if (21)holds.
Also, the measurability conditions i) in Theorem 12 and i) in Deﬁnition 4 are
equivalent.
Lemma 2. Let{µt}0≤t≤Tbe a family of Borel probability measures on H. Then the
following are equivalent:
i) The map
t/ma√sto→ˆ
Hˆ
( /CC2)kh(x,u(x)) dxdµt(u) (27)
is measurable for all h∈ Hk
0( /CC2; /CA2)and allk∈ /C6.
ii) The map
t/ma√sto→ˆ
Hϕ(u)dµt(u) (28)
is measurable for all ϕ∈Cb(Hw).
Very similarly to [36], we employ a monotone class argument ( see for instance
[60, Theorem A.1]).
Theorem 14. LetWbe a vector space of bounded real functions on a set Ωthat
contains the constant functions and is closed under bounded monotone convergence.
IfMis a subset of Wwhich is closed under multiplication, then Wcontains every
bounded function that is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra on Ωgenerated by
M.
32We are also going to use the following result from [33, Lemma 2 .10].
Lemma 3. For everyh∈ Hk
0( /CC2; /CA2)andk∈ /C6, the function
u/ma√sto→ˆ
( /CC2)kh(x,u(x)) dx (29)
is continuous on H.
In the following proof of Lemma 2, we let (Jε)ε>0be the family of smoothing
operators associated to a family of standard molliﬁers.
Proof of Lemma 2. We ﬁrst assume ii). Then, let k∈ /C6,h∈ Hk
0( /CC2; /CA2)and deﬁne
ϕ(u):=ˆ
( /CC2)kh(x,u(x)) dx, u∈H
as well as
ϕε(u):=ϕ(Jεu) =ˆ
( /CC2)kh(x,Jεu(x)) dx, u∈H,
for everyε >0. We note that whenever un⇀ u(n→ ∞)inH, thenJεun→
Jεu(n→ ∞)pointwise on /CC2. Sincehis continuous in the second argument, the
dominated convergence theorem yields ϕε∈Cb(Hw). In particular,
t/ma√sto→ˆ
Hϕε(u)dµt(u)
is measurable.
Due to the continuity of ϕwith respect to /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblL2by Lemma 3 and the convergence
Jεu→u(ε→0)inHfor anyu∈H, we obtain pointwise convergence ϕε→
ϕ(ε→0)onH. Then the dominated convergence theorem yields measurabil ity of
t/ma√sto→´
Hϕ(u)dµt(u)as the a.e. pointwise limit of measurable functions.
Now we assume i) and show the converse. To apply Theorem 14, we consider
Ω =H,Wto be the set of bounded and Borel measurable functions Ψ:H→ /CA
such thatt/ma√sto→´
HΨ(u)dµt(u)is measurable, and Mthe space of all functions as in
(29) forh∈ Hk
0( /CC2; /CA2)and allk∈ /C6. Our assumption i) precisely guarantees that
M⊂W.
It can be shown that with these deﬁnitions, the assumptions o f Theorem 14 are
satisﬁed. We denote the σ-algebra generated by MwithA.
For any ﬁxed u0∈H, by considering smooth cut-oﬀ functions χ∈C∞
c( /CA2), one
can use the approximations (x,ξ)/ma√sto→ |ξ−u0(x)|χ(ξ)∈ H1
0( /CC2; /CA2)to show that
u/ma√sto→´/CC2|u(x)−u0(x)|2dx=/ba∇dblu−u0/ba∇dbl2
L2isA-measurable and consequently, all open
balls inHareA-measurable. In particular, Acontains the Borel- σ-algebra on H.
The latter is also generated by the Hwtopology as remarked before so that any
ϕ∈Cb(Hw)belongs toWas desired. /squaresolid
33Before ﬁnally proving Theorem 13, we give an equivalent form ulation of the
Foiaş-Liouville equation, which can be compared more easil y to (19). The alternative
formulation (30) to (9) in Deﬁnition 4 almost everywhere can be proved as in [38, §3
Lemma 5]. Altering the family of measures on a Lebesgue null s et so that (9) holds
everywhere can be done as in [38, §3 Theorem 2] under the assum ption of uniformly
bounded supports, which we also make in Theorem 13.
Lemma 4. Letµand{µt}0≤t≤Tbe Borel probability measures on Hsatisfying i) and
ii) in Deﬁnition 4 and suppose that there exists R>0such that for a.e. 0≤t≤T
suppµ,suppµt⊂BH
R.
Then iii) in Deﬁnition 4 holds true if (after altering {µt}0≤t≤Ton a Lebesgue null
set) and only if

c([0,T)).
Proof of Theorem 13. Due to Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, all that remains to show is
the equivalence between the versions of the Foiaş-Liouvill e equations (30) and (19)
as well as the equivalence of the energy inequalities (8) and (22). The latter, how-
ever, follows in a rather straightforward way from Theorem 1 2.
Suppose ﬁrst that {µt}0≤t≤Tis a phase-space statistical solution with initial distri-
butionµand uniformly bounded support in BH
R. We then show that ν,νsatisfy
(19).

nand/ba∇dbl∇χn/ba∇dblL∞≤1,
the uniform bound of the supports (26) and the dominated conv ergence theorem
yield that (31) also holds in the limit, i.e. without χandε(χ). We particularly used
that each integrand in (31) and the error term εcan be bounded by a constant times
/ba∇dblθ/ba∇dblC1maxi=1,...,k/ba∇dblgi/ba∇dblC1(1 +/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblk+2
L2). Using this estimate along with the uniform
bound (26) of the supports {µt}0≤t≤Tandµ, one can also show by a standard
cut-oﬀ argument that the identity in (25) may be applied to th e above integrals.
Transforming (31) immediately yields (19).
We now suppose that νis a moment based statistical solution with initial correla tion
measure νand show the converse, i.e. that {µt}0≤t≤Tis a phase space statistical
solution with initial distribution µ.
Letφ∈C1

There exists a sequence of multivariate polynomials (Pn)n∈ /C6such thatPn→φ(n→

Remark 3. In the proof above of Theorem 13, it seems diﬃcult to signiﬁca ntly
relax the assumptions of uniformly bounded supports of µand{µt}0≤t≤Tdue to the
uniform approximation of a compactly supported function by polynomials.
3.2 Construction of Statistical Solutions
In this subsection, we would like to comment on and draw some c omparisons between
established methods by which one can construct the statisti cal solutions that we
described in the previous part. We will focus here on the foll owing three methods:
36I) Compactness of approximating sequences of time-paramet rized measures;
II) Discrete approximations based on the Krein-Milman theo rem;
III) Measurable selections and push-forward construction s.
However, we would at least like to mention that for (non-auto nomous) dissipative
dynamical systems, there is a fairly general way of using the theory of (pullback)
attractors and Banach limits to construct statistical and s tationary statistical solu-
tions. We refer the reader to some of the work by Foiaş, Rosa an d Teman [42, 43],
by Łukaszewicz et al. [69, 71, 72], see also [70], and Zhao et a l. [89, 90, 91].
For each of the aforementioned methods, we will sketch how th ey can be applied
to prove the following existence result.
Theorem 15. Letµbe a Borel probability measure on Hsatisfying
ˆ
H/ba∇dblu0/ba∇dbl2
H1dµ(u0)<∞. (34)
Then there exists a phase space statistical solution of the 2 D incompressible Euler
equations {µt}0≤t≤Twith initial distribution µand the energy inequality
ˆ
H/ba∇dblu/ba∇dbl2
L2dµt(u)≤ˆ
H/ba∇dblu0/ba∇dbl2
L2dµ(u0) (35)
holds for a.e. every 0≤t≤T.
Under the assumption of initial data in H1, there exist weak solutions of the
Euler equations continuous with values in Hor evenH1, not just in Hw. In the
constructions in II) and III), we may therefore more natural ly consider statistical
solutions as Borel probability measures on HorC([0,T];H), in contrast to the
slightly more general formulations of the previous section .
We formulate the following statement globally in time in ord er to also be able
to apply it in III), when considering semiﬂow selections.
Proposition 1. Letu0∈H1, then there exists a global weak solution u∈Cloc([0,∞);H1)
of the Euler equations such that its vorticity ω(u)∈Cloc([0,∞);L2( /CC2))is a renor-
malized solution of the vorticity formulation of the Euler e quations and the following
properties hold:
i)/ba∇dblu(t)/ba∇dblL2≤ /ba∇dblu(t′)/ba∇dblL2for all0≤t′≤t<∞,
ii)/ba∇dblω(u)(t)/ba∇dblL2=/ba∇dblω(u)(0)/ba∇dblL2for all0≤t<∞,
iii)esssupt′≤τ≤t/ba∇dbl∂tu(τ)/ba∇dblH−s≤C/ba∇dblu(t′)/ba∇dblL2for somes >0,C=C(s)>0and all
0≤t′≤t<∞.
37Here, the vorticity of a ﬂow ﬁeld uis deﬁned as ω=∂x1u2−∂x2u1. The vorticity
formulation of the Euler equations is obtained by taking the curl of the mo mentum
equation, whereby
∂tω+u·∇ω= 0. (36)
A distributional solution ωof this vorticity transport equation is called renormalized
if for every β∈C1( /CA; /CA)withβ(0) = 0 and bounded derivative, also
∂tβ(ω)+u·∇β(ω) = 0.
The subscript lochere means that we consider the compact-open topology on
these spaces of continuous functions. The proof of this prop osition on arbitrary
ﬁnite time intervals is somewhat classical (cf. [24, 22, 68, 58]). For global existence,
one can employ a diagonal argument.
3.2.1 Compactness of Approximating Sequences of Time-Para metrized
Measures
The idea here is to construct a statistical solution {µt}0≤t≤Tby considering approx-
imating sequences of families of Borel probability measure s({µN
t}0≤t≤T)N∈ /C6and
using compactness theorems.
We state here prototypically the arguments from Foiaş’ ﬁrst article on statistical
solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations [38]. There, give n an appropriate ﬁxed or-
thonormal base of H, theN-th order Galerkin solution operators SN
t,0≤t≤T, were
considered. Then, given a Borel probability measure µonH, the approximations
µN
t:=SN
t♯µwere studied.
We summarize the compactness arguments that Foiaş derived i n the following
theorem, which hold generally as stated and not just for the a bove example of
pushforward Galerkin approximations. For this, we deﬁne C2(H)to be the space
of all continuous functions ϕ:H→ /CAsuch that /ba∇dblϕ/ba∇dblC2(H):= supu∈H|ϕ(u)|
1+/ba∇dblu/ba∇dbl2
L2<∞.
Then(C2(H),/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblC2(H))is a Banach space, not reﬂexive nor separable, which was a
main diﬃculty in the proof.
Also, we recall that for a topological space X, we say that for a subset AofX,
x∈Xis an accumulation point if for every open neighborhood Uofx,A∩(U\{x})
is nonempty.
As usual and previously used, the weak-* topology on the dual of a Banach space
Yis the coarsest topology for which the linear functionals {fy}y∈YonY′, given by
fy(ϕ) =ϕ(y)for allϕ∈Y′,y∈Y, are continuous.
In particular, if ϕ∈Y′is a weak-* accumulation point of A⊂Y′, then for every
ε>0andy1,...,yk∈Y,A∩{ψ∈Y′:|ψ(yi)−ϕ(yi)|<εfor alli= 1,...,k} /\e}atio\slash=∅.
The following theorem holds in both two and three dimensions .
Theorem 16. Suppose that a sequence ({µN

Under an assumption of the form (34) on the mean initial vorti city, Chae in [9]
essentially argued along the same lines to obtain a ﬁrst exis tence result for statistical
solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equations on a peri odic domain, though the
issue ofC2(H)not being separable was kind of ignored. We sketch the proof h ere.
In before, we need to point out that in the following, from The orem 16, we may
only obtain a family of measures {µt}0≤t≤T, representing an accumulation point,
which satisﬁes (30) instead of (9). We remark that we could ap ply Lemma 4 in the
following proof to actually obtain (9) if µhad bounded support in H(the bounded
support of {µt}0≤t≤Twould then follow from the construction).
39Proof of Theorem 15 (Sketch 1). We consider vanishing viscosity approximations.
Therefore, let ε>0denote the kinematic viscosity and consider statistical so lutions
{µε
t}0≤t≤Tof the 2D Navier-Stokes equations with viscosity εand initial distribution
µ(cf. [40, Theorems V.1.1, V.1.2]). As the Navier-Stokes equ ations yield unique
weak solutions, this statistical solution can be construct ed as the pushforward mea-
sure of the initial distribution along a solution operator. Consequently, energy and
enstrophy inequalities, among other properties, carry ove r. In particular, the fol-
lowing holds:
i) The mapping t/ma√sto→ˆ

As ii) - iv) are uniform estimates in ε, we may indeed apply Theorem 16 to obtain a
family of Borel probability measures {µt}0≤t≤Trepresenting a weak-* accumulation

Under a weak statistical scaling assumption, relating the s econd and third order
longitudal structure functions, the 3D vanishing viscosit y limit of statistical solutions
was considered by Fjordholm, Mishra, Weber in [36] by employ ing a compactness
result for correlation measures, ﬁrst published in [34] (se e also [66, Theorem 2.4] for
40a similar theorem). We will also state this compactness theo rem in the following
and roughly compare it to Theorem 16.
We use the spaces Hk,2( /CC2; /CA2)andHk,2

to Deﬁnition 7.

We remark that the basic assumptions (38), (39) in Theorem 16 are, likewise to
(43) and (44) in Theorem 17, used to be able to pass to the limit in an appropriate
preliminary way. However, in order to have convergence of th e integrals in both
types of Liouville equations (30) and (19), e.g., when consi dering the vanishing
viscosity limit, one needs better results on convergence al ong certain observables. In
Theorem 16, the space C2(H)is speciﬁcally tailored towards the quadratic term u/ma√sto→
(u⊗u,∇Φ′(u)),Φ∈ Tand thereby one needs to make sure that ii) in Theorem 16
is also satisﬁed. Similarly, all terms in (19) are in Hk,2
1and v) in Theorem 17 is
somewhat crucial.
41More in detail: The assumptions (38) and (43) on ﬁniteness of the second /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblL2
related moments are equivalent.
The second assumption (39) in Theorem 16 is stronger than (44 ). Indeed, (39)
implies (44) as the following computation shows. Let (νn)n∈ /C6⊂ L2([0,T], /CC2; /CA2)
be a sequence of correlation measures satisfying (43) with a ssociated families of
Borel probability measures ({µn
t}0≤t≤T)n∈ /C6satisfying (37) and (38). Suppose that

which converges uniformly in nto 0 in the limit (r→0)so that (44) holds.
The converse is false, however, as (44) does not necessarily make any implications
on the mean H1norm. For instance, if we consider a bounded sequence (un)n∈ /C6in
L2( /CC2; /CA2), then the associated (constant in time) atomic correlation measures can
be shown to satisfy (44) if and only if (un)n∈ /C6is precompact in L2( /CC2; /CA2).
However, comparing the third assumption (41) in Theorem 16 a nd v) in Theorem 17
respectively, the much stronger integrability assumption s that were already needed
in Deﬁnition 7 of moment-based statistical solutions also c ome in again. Indeed,
it does not seem possible in the proof of Theorem 17, given in [ 34], to replace the
assumption of a uniformly bounded support in L2( /CC2; /CA2)with something much
milder such as (41).
3.2.2 Discrete Approximations Based on the Krein-Milman Th eorem
Generalizing the existence result by Chae in [9], two of the a uthors recently applied
in [85] the second, here to be discussed, method of construct ing statistical solutions
by using discrete approximations based on the Krein-Milman theorem. This method
42appears to have been ﬁrst presented in [40] for the Navier-St okes equations and was
later elevated to a much more general and abstract setting in [6]. In our setting
of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations, we can formulate the main
existence result as follows, which incorporates the right a ssumptions in order for the
approximation to work. We give a sketch of the arguments afte rwards.
Theorem 18. LetXbe a measurable subset of Hand letU ⊂C([0,T];Hw)consist
of weak solutions of the Euler equations. Let µbe a Borel probability measure on H,
concentrated on Xand suppose that
A)Π0U=X,
there exists a family K′(X)of compact subsets of Xsuch that
B)µis tight with respect to K′(X), i.e.
∀A∈ B(H) :µ(A) = sup
K∈K′(X)
K⊂Aµ(K),
C) For every K∈ K′(X),Π−1
0(K)∩Uis compact in C([0,T];Hw).
Then there exists a trajectory statistical solution µof the Euler equations with initial
distribution Π0♯µ=µ.
Condition A) just means that for every initial datum u0∈X, there exists a
weak solution in Uto the corresponding Cauchy problem. B) and C) mean that for
a large enough family of compact sets of initial data, the wea k solution trajectories
inUwith initial data in one of those sets are compact.
This theorem can roughly be proved as follows (cf. [40, 41, 6] ):
• Assumption B) allows one to reduce the proof to the case of µbeing carried
by someK∈ K′(X). Then we may view µas a measure on K.
• The space C(K)′along with the weak-* topology is a Hausdorﬀ locally convex
space and the unit ball B∋µis compact and convex.
• Therefore, by the Krein-Milman theorem, Bis equal to the closure of the
convex hull of its extremal points, the latter being precise ly the Dirac measures
onK. In other words, for every N∈ /C6, there exist nN∈ /C6,λN
1,...,λN
nN≥0
anduN
0,1,...,uN
0,nN∈Ksuch that
nN/summationdisplay
i=1λN
i= 1andµ0,N:=nN/summationdisplay
i=1λN
iδuN
0,i∗⇀µ(N→ ∞).
• Now for each N∈ /C6, we deﬁne
µN:=nN/summationdisplay
i=1λN
iδuN
i
as Borel probability measures on κ:= Π−1
0(K)∩U, where for each N∈ /C6and
i= 1,...,nN, we letuN
i∈κsuch thatuN
i(0) =uN
0,i. This is possible due to A).
43• Asκis compact, C(κ)is separable and by the Banach-Alaoglu theorem, after
passing to a subsequence, (µN)N∈ /C6can be seen to converge weakly-* in C(κ)′
to someµ, which, extended to a measure on C([0,T];Hw), can be shown to
be a trajectory statistical solution with Π0♯µ=µ.
• A corresponding phase space statistical solution can be ob tained from Theo-
rem 10.
It is apparent from this sketch that this theorem also holds i n the better behaved
setting of Theorem 15, when Hwis replaced with HorH1.
Proof of Theorem 15 (Sketch 2). In the setting of Theorem 18, let X=H1and
Ube the set of all weak solutions as in Proposition 1, so that A) is immediately
satisﬁed. For properties B) and C), choose K′(X)to be the set of all subsets of H1,
compact w.r.t. /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblH1.
Due to (34), µis concentrated on H1. Moreover, /ba∇dbl · /ba∇dblH1and/ba∇dbl · /ba∇dblL2generate the
same Borel- σ-algebra on H1so that we can see µas a measure on H1. Then B)
follows from the general fact of Borel probability measures on Polish spaces being
tight [77, Theorem 3.2].
Moving on to C), for every K∈ K′(X),κ:= Π−1
0(K)∩ Uis in fact already
compact in C([0,T];H1):Kbeing bounded in H1yields uniform bounds on the
quantities involved in i) - iii) in Proposition 1 which in ter m implies uniform bound-
edness ofκinH1. Then the precompactness in C([0,T];H)follows from iii) and
the Aubin-Lions lemma.
Convergence in C([0,T];H)is enough to conclude that limits of subsequences of
velocities in Uare once again weak solutions of the Euler equations and i) al so holds
in the limit. Similarly, from weak lower semicontinuity of t he left-hand side in iii)
and the strong convergence of the right-hand side, we may see that such limits of
sequences in κalso satisfy iii).
As for property ii), due to compactness of KinH1, we may assume strong com-
pactness of the initial vorticities in κ. We also obtain from ii) weak-* compactness
of the vorticities of κinL∞(0,T;L2( /CC2))and combined with the compactness of
the velocities in C([0,T];H), this suﬃces to show that the vorticity of such a limit
inκis a weak solution of the vorticity formulation (36) of the Eu ler equations. Now
it suﬃces to note that weak vorticity solutions in L2( /CC2)are automatically renor-
malized and in fact, strong convergence of the vorticities h olds inC([0,T];L2( /CC2))
in the inviscid limit cf. [68, 16, 76]. Note that by a Calderón -Zygmund argument,
continuity and compactness in L2( /CC2)of the vorticity is enough to obtain continuity
and compactness of the full gradient in L2( /CC2).
In summary, κis compact in C([0,T];H1)and Theorem 18 is applicable so that
we obtain a trajectory statistical solution µonU ⊂C([0,T];H1)with initial distri-
butionµ. In combination with Theorem 10, one obtains the phase space statistical
solutions {µt}0≤t≤T={Πt♯µ}0≤t≤Twith initial distribution µ. In particular, the
energy inequality is satisﬁed due to

Remark 4. The same argument in Sketch 2 that showed the energy inequali ty can
also be used to show the conservation of enstrophy, i.e. the p hase space statistical
solution satisﬁes

H1/ba∇dblω(u)(t)/ba∇dblL2dµt(u) =ˆ
H1/ba∇dblω(u0)/ba∇dblL2dµ(u0). (46)
3.2.3 Measurable Selections and Push-Forward Constructio ns
The third method that we very brieﬂy review here is the constr uction of pushforward
measures of initial distributions along a measurable selec tion operator of the possibly
non-unique weak solutions. This is perhaps the most straigh tforward way in which
one can construct statistical solutions and ties in with the derivation of the notion
of statistical solution, as discussed in the introduction, where we also assumed the
existence of a solution operator.
This method was employed by Ladyzhenskaya and Vershik in [82 ] to solve the
Hopf statistical equation in coordinate form.
More precisely, they applied a version of the now classical K uratowski and Ryll-
Nardzewski selection principle to the three-dimensional N avier-Stokes equations.
Here, we would like to state a more recent and reﬁned result du e to Cardona and
Kapitanski on semiﬂow selections in [8], where also the exam ple of the Navier-Stokes
equations is discussed. Their work has also inspired the rec ent articles by Breit,
Feireisl and Hofmanová on semiﬂow selection for the isentro pic and complete Euler
system [3, 4] and this selection and push-forward principle has then also been used
by Fanelli and Feireisl to show existence of a newly introduc ed concept of statistical
solutions to the barotropic Navier-Stokes system [27].
For everys≥0, the splicing at time sof two functions v,won[0,∞)with
w(s) =v(0)is deﬁned as
(w⊲⊳sv)(t) =/braceleftigg
w(t),0≤t≤s
v(t−s), t≥s.
We also deﬁne the time shifts θsfor everys≥0so thatθsw(t) =w(t+s)for every
functionwon[0,∞)and everyt∈[0,∞).
Theorem 19. LetXbe a Polish space, Cloc([0,∞);X)be the space of continuous
functions endowed with the compact-open topology and for x∈X, denote by Ωx
the subset of trajectories in Cloc([0,∞);X)starting at x. Suppose that Ψis a map-
ping fromXonto the non-empty subsets of Cloc([0,∞);X)satisfying the following
properties:
a) For every x∈X,Ψ(x)is a compact subset in Ω(x).
45b)Ψis measurable in the sense that for every closed set A⊂Ω,{x∈X: Ψ(x)∩A/\e}atio\slash=
∅}is a Borel measurable subset of X.
c)Ψis compatible with the semigroup θsin the sense that for every s≥0,x∈X,
we have
w∈Ψ(x)⇒θs(w)∈Ψ(w(s)).
d)Ψsatisﬁes a glueing property in the sense that for w∈Ψ(x)andv∈Ψ(w(s))
for somes∈[0,∞), alsow⊲⊳sv∈Ψ(x).
Then there exists a measurable semiﬂow selection ψofΨ, i.e.,ψis a Borel measur-
able mapping from XtoCloc([0,∞);X)so thatψ(x)∈Ψ(x)for everyx∈Xand
it has the semiﬂow property ψ(x,t+s) =ψ(ψ(x,t),s)for allt,s≥0.
Proof of Theorem 15 (Sketch 3). We consider X=H1and for any u0∈H1, we let
Ψ(u0)⊂Cloc([0,∞);H1)be the set of all weak solutions with properties i) - iii) in
Proposition 1 and initial datum u0.
The assumptions a)-d) in Theorem 19 are satisﬁed for similar or identical reasons
as in our second sketch of the proof of Theorem 15, more precis ely:
Ψ(u0)is non-empty for every u0∈H1by Proposition 1. Moreover, Ψ(u0)is
compact in Cloc([0,∞);H1), as we already saw in Sketch 2 for ﬁnite time intervals
and from which we may obtain the global case by a diagonal argu ment.
As for b), for any closed set A⊂Cloc([0,∞);H1), one can also prove that
{u0∈H1: Ψ(u0)∩A/\e}atio\slash=∅}is closed in H1by employing the same arguments.
For c) and d), all of the properties of weak solutions with the above properties are
preserved for time-shifts and splicings, as can be seen rath er immediately, perhaps
with exception of the weak velocity and renormalized vortic ity formulation of the
Euler equations. This last point can be proved by approximat ing a given test func-
tion appropriately as for instance in [8, Section 4.3] in the case of the Navier-Stokes
equations.
In summary, Theorem 19 is applicable and we may consider a mea surable selec-
tionSofΨ. Due to its measurability, we may consider the pushforward m easure
µ:=S♯µonCloc([0,∞);H1)so thatµis a trajectory statistical solution with initial
distribution µ. Using Theorem 10, one obtains a phase-space statistical so lution as
desired in Theorem 15 also satisfying the energy inequality (35) everywhere, as can
be shown as in our second sketch. /squaresolid
Remark 5. Similarly to Remark 4, the statistical solution constructe d here also
satisﬁes the enstrophy balance (46).
3.2.4 Conclusions
We close this subsection by remarking that all three methods that we described here
have in common that they actually rely in some form on compact ness properties of
weak deterministic solutions and/or approximations there of: For instance in the two-
dimensional case when considering the vanishing viscosity limit for initial data with
vorticity in L2, the uniform bounds (38) and (39) in Theorem 16 are the analog ues
46of the uniform estimates which in the deterministic case all ow one to pass to the
limit, and are therefore also satisﬁed by the pushforward ap proximations along the
two-dimensional Navier-Stokes solution operators.
In Subsection 3.2.2, the compactness of weak solutions with initial data in cer-
tain compact sets is precisely assumption C) in Theorem 18. S imilarly, also in
Theorem 19 the compactness of solution trajectories sharin g a common initial da-
tum is assumed, though we mention here that for the classical Kuratowski and
Ryll-Nardzewski selection theorem, closedness would be en ough.
Overall, this close connection to existence and compactnes s of weak deterministic
solutions yields at least that the constructed statistical solutions typically satisfy
similar properties.
While for any u0∈H, inﬁnitely many weak solutions of the incompressible Euler
equations, possibly even satisfying the energy inequality , may be constructed [19, 86],
the lack of compactness of these convex integration solutio ns makes it impossible at
the moment to construct statistical solutions of the incomp ressible Euler equations
with the presented tools for any initial distribution µonHwithout any further
assumptions such as (34).
3.3 Comparison to Measure-Valued Solutions
3.3.1 Statistics of Singular Limits
The formulation of statistical solutions in terms of correl ation measures allows for
an alternative, somewhat simpler interpretation by consid ering all inﬁnitely many
multipoint correlations instead of a single distribution o n an inﬁnite dimensional
space. In contrast, measure-valued solutions only describ e the one-point statistics
of a system.
One would hope that by “adding” (all) multipoint correlatio ns to Young measures
and measure-valued solutions, results on uniqueness and st ability would be easier to
achieve. This, however, is diﬀerent from the context in whic h DiPerna and Majda
introduced the notion of measure-valued solution in [25] to treat the inviscid limit
problem, cf. Section 2. Correlation measures as deﬁned in Se ction 3.1 appear to be
too strong of a concept to study oscillatory limits.
As an easy example, consider the function u: /CC→ /CA, given by
u(x) =/braceleftigg
0,0<x≤1
2
1,1
2<x≤1
and extended periodically. Then we deﬁne un(x):=u(nx)for allx∈ /CCandn∈/C6. The two-point correlations of (un)n∈ /C6in the limit are described by the Young
measure {ν2
x,y}(x,y)∈ /CC2generated by vn(x,y):= (un(x),un(y)),n∈ /C6,(x,y)∈ /CC2. It
is not hard to see that, constantly in (x,y)∈ /CC2,
ν2
x,y≡1
4δ(0,0)+1
4δ(0,1)+1
4δ(1,0)+1
4δ(1,1).
47However, this constant Young measure cannot be part of a corr elation measure as
the diagonal continuity (15) is violated since we have, cons tantly inr>0,
ˆ/CC2−ˆ
Br(x)/a\}b∇acketle{tν2
x,y,|ξ1−ξ2|2/a\}b∇acket∇i}htdydx=1
2>0.
On a related note, it is possible, however, to associate Bore l probability measures
to (generalized) Young measures and also to generalize the f undamental theorem of
Young measures to obtain a notion of generating Young measur es by sequences of
Borel probability measures, cf. [10].
3.3.2 Weak-Strong Uniqueness
We mentioned before that one would hope to obtain better stab ility and uniqueness
results for statistical solutions compared to measure-val ued solutions. In this regard,
much is yet to be desired.
If the initial data in the support of an initial distribution yields unique solutions
in a certain class, it is usually quite simple to show uniquen ess of trajectory statistical
solutions, see for instance [85, Theorem 2.6] for the case of the two-dimensional Euler
equations with initial data and solutions in the Yudovich cl ass or, more generally, [84,
Chapter IV §6].
For phase space statistical solutions, similar uniqueness results are much harder
to achieve. In case of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes eq uations, see for instance
Theorem 1.2 in Chapter V of [40]. In [66], a weaker kind of weak -strong uniqueness
was shown, building upon weak-strong uniqueness of measure -valued solutions of
the Euler equations, cf. Theorem 5. As it ﬁts nicely to the con tent of this article
and for the convenience of the reader, we present it here but o nly sketch the proof
of the main result. The following holds in both d= 2andd= 3dimensions.
Bystrong in this context of weak-strong uniqueness, we mean that we co nsider sta-
tistical solutions with an initial distribution that is con centrated on a (slightly larger)
set of initial data that yields classical solutions on the co nsidered time interval.
More precisely, we consider the set C ⊂C1( /CCd; /CAd)∩Hof initial data vwhich
yields classical solutions of the Euler equations v∈C1( /CC2×[0,T]; /CA2)so that
C(v):= supt∈[0,T]/ba∇dbl∇v(t)/ba∇dbl∞<∞. Now, for every n∈ /C6, let
Gn=/uniondisplay
v∈CBH
e−C(v)T/n(v)and deﬁne G=/intersectiondisplay
n∈ /C6Gn.
To be able to build on the weak-strong uniqueness of measure- valued solutions, we
need to use the notion of dissipative statistical solutions . Before giving the precise
deﬁnition, let us introduce the following notation: For a Bo rel probability measure
µonHas in Theorem 12, we denote by ν1(µ) ={ν1
x(µ)}x∈ /CCdthe ﬁrst Young
measure in the hierarchy of Young measures that constitute t he correlation measure
associated to µ. Also, for such measures µandα= (α1,...,αN)∈[0,1]such that/summationtextN
i=1αi= 1, we consider the set Λ(α,µ):={(µ1,...,µN) :µ=/summationtextN
i=1αiµi}ofN-
tuples of Borel probability measures on H. Note that always (µ,...,µ)∈Λ(α,µ)so
that this set is never empty.
48Deﬁnition 8. A statistical solution {µt}0≤t<Tin phase space of the Euler equations
with initial distribution µis called dissipative statistical solution of the Euler equa-
tions if for every N∈ /C6,α∈[0,1]Nsatisfying/summationtextN
i=1αi= 1and(µ1,...,µN)∈
Λ(α,µ), there exist (ˆµ1,t,...,ˆµN,t)∈Λ(α,µt)for almost every 0≤t≤Tsuch that
for eachi= 1,...,N,{ν1(ˆµi,t)}0≤t≤Tis an oscillation measure-valued solution of the
incompressible Euler equations with initial Young measure ν1(µi).
Theorem 20 ([66]).Letµbe a Borel probability measure on Hwhich is concen-
trated on Gand has bounded support in BH
Mfor someM >0. Then there exists
a unique dissipative statistical solution of the incompres sible Euler equations with
initial distribution µ.
Remark 6. i) The deﬁnition in [66] of dissipative statistical solutio ns also con-
tains a property of (weak) time-regularity. This, however, is not required for
Theorem 20 and is consequently omitted in Deﬁnition 8.
ii) Theorem 20 in particular yields existence and uniquenes s of dissipative statis-
tical solutions in the two-dimensional case for initial dis tributions concentrated
onC1,β( /CC2; /CA2)∩Hfor someβ∈(0,1)and of bounded support.
Proof of Theorem 20 (sketch). Partitions and approximation s:We begin by intro-
ducing partitions of G.
SinceHis separable, countably many open balls in the deﬁnition of Gnsuﬃce to
coverGnfor everyn∈ /C6. By considering the countable union over n∈ /C6of the
countably many centers of balls that cover Gn, we obtain a countable set {ui}i∈I
(for simplicity assume I= /C6) such that Gn=/uniontext∞
i=1Bri/n(ui)for everyn∈ /C6, where

Based on stability of classical solutions, which also motiv ated the speciﬁc choice
of radiiri,i∈ /C6, one can show that ({µ(n)

spect to the Wasserstein distance d2. Due to completeness of the Wasserstein space,
one obtains measures {µt}0≤t≤Tin the uniform limit which also form a dissipative
statistical solution with initial distribution µ.
Uniqueness: For the proof of uniqueness, suppose that {˜µt}0≤t≤Tis also a dis-
sipative statistical solution with initial distribution µ. Due to Step 2, it suﬃces to
show that limn→∞d2(˜µt,µ(n)

4 Discussion and Open Problems
The following problems that we list here are not speciﬁcally related to the incom-
pressible Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. Instead, they are problems on a more
general level and some more insight and further examples wou ld beneﬁt the area.
Existence Independently of the Deterministic Problem
The Dirac measures of weak solutions satisfy the Foiaş-Liou ville equation (4). For
non-unique solutions sharing the same initial data, convex combinations of the cor-
responding solutions also satisfy (4). In this way, the conc ept of statistical solutions
allows for deterministic initial data which “splits” into n on-deterministic distribu-
tions so that statistical solutions are a more ﬂexible solut ion concept than weak
solutions.
However, as mentioned in our conclusion of Section 3.2, curr ent methods for ob-
taining existence of statistical solutions generally rely on existence and even some
kind of compactness of the underlying deterministic soluti ons. It would be inter-
esting to see further approaches primarily based on the Foia ş-Liouville equation,
perhaps even for equations and/or data where weak determini stic existence is un-
known.
51Connections Between Phase Space Statistical Solutions and Trajectory
Statistical Solutions
We have seen in Theorem 10 that by projecting a trajectory sta tistical solution
of the incompressible Euler equations at every point in time yields a phase space
statistical solution. This also holds true in a very general setting [6, Theorem 3.3].
It is generally unknown if the converse holds as well. It is kn own for instance for
the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations (with initia l distribution of bounded
support) as both the trajectory and phase space statistical solutions are uniquely
given as pushforward measures of the initial distribution a long the solution operator
in trajectory or phase space respectively. Perhaps more int erestingly, this is also
true for time-average stationary statistical solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-
Stokes equations [43, Theorem 5.5]. So far, no counterexamp les, i.e., phase space
statistical solutions that cannot be obtained as projectio ns of trajectory statistical
solutions, can be found in the literature for any equation. T his is related to the
previous problem as it requires a further study of the Foiaş- Liouville equation and
its connection to the deterministic formulation.
Connections Between Young Measures and Correlation Measur es
Let us consider the map F:L2( /CC2; /CA2)→L∞
w( /CC2,P( /CA2)), whereFprojects onto
the ﬁrst Young measure of ﬁnite kinetic energy in the hierarc hy of Young measures
that constitute a correlation measure in L2( /CC2; /CA2).
Then it is unclear to us if Fis one-to-one or onto. Being onto would mean that
every Young measure {νx}x∈ /CC2of ﬁnite kinetic energy would be the ﬁrst correlation
marginal of a correlation measure in L2( /CC2; /CA2). Due to Theorem 12, this is equiv-
alent to the existence of a Borel probability measure µonL2( /CC2; /CA2)having ﬁnite
second moment so that for every h∈ H1
0( /CC2; /CA2)
ˆ
L2ˆ/CC2h(x,u(x)) dxdµ(u) =ˆ/CC2/a\}b∇acketle{tνx,h(x,ξ)/a\}b∇acket∇i}htdx.
Fbeing one-to-one would mean that such a µ, if it exists, is unique.
Intuitively, Fbeing onto while not being one-to-one seems reasonable. The latter,
that is being one-to-one, would mean that the ﬁrst correlati on marginal determines
all further multipoint correlations.
However, since the required properties of a correlation mea sure, in particular the
diagonal continuity, are quite restrictive, this is not ent irely obvious and proofs or
explicit examples would be desirable. The only explicit exa mple in this context is
again that of a single Dirac Young measure which can only in a u nique way, due
to the diagonal continuity, be “extended” to a full correlat ion measure, namely the
atomic correlation measure.
Finally, we would like to point here at the general problem of a lack of more or
less explicit examples of statistical solutions. Unless th e system is well-posed and
all phase space statistical solutions are given as pushforw ard measures of an initial
distribution along the solution semigroup, the only explic it examples at hand seem
to be convex combinations of Diracs corresponding to weak so lutions. Even the
52well-posed case is inconvenient to handle in the context of c orrelation measures and
moment-based statistical solutions. For example, conside r the case of a measurable
semigroup {St}t≥0and a Borel probability measure µ0onL2( /CC2; /CA2)having ﬁnite
second moment so that we may deﬁne ρt:=St♯µ0for everyt≥0. For anyh∈
Hk
0( /CC2; /CA2)the right-hand side in (25) is
ˆ
L2ˆ
( /CC2)kh(x,u(x)) dxdρt(u) =ˆ
L2ˆ
( /CC2)kh(x,(Stu0)(x)) dxdµ0(u0).
So it can be expressed in terms of the initial distribution an d the given semigroup
{St}t≥0.
However, one cannot make sense of the left-hand side in (25) s imilarly just in terms of
the initial correlation measure corresponding to µ0and{St}t≥0. Note that here, for
givenx∈( /CC2)kandt≥0,h(x,·): ( /CA2)k→ /CAwhileSt:L2( /CC2; /CA2)→L2( /CC2; /CA2),
hence the composition ξ/ma√sto→h(x,Stξ)does not make sense.
