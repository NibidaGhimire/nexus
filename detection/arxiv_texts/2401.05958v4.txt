The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly on their relative
orientation, which manifests as a rotational state dependence. Interactions between molecules in
the same rotational quantum state are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions.
Interactions in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole interactions.
We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ by more than one quantum,
they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect
can reduce collisional loss by multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to
applications in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.
I. INTRODUCTION
Well-separated molecules interact with one another
through the Coulomb potential set by their electric fields.
This electric field can be described as an expansion in
terms of multipoles, such as the molecular charge, dipole
moment, quadrupole moment, and so on [1, 2]. The elec-
trostatic interaction between two molecules can then be
expanded similarly, giving rise to dipole-dipole, dipole-
quadrupole, quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, and so
forth. Interactions involving higher multipole moments
decay with higher inverse powers of the intermolecular
distance R. For instance, the interaction between two
charges scales with 1 /Rand dipole-dipole interactions
with 1 /R3. More generally, when we label the two multi-
poles with ranks lAandlB, then the interaction between
two multipoles scales as 1 /RlA+lB+1. From here on, we
only consider neutral molecules such that dipole-dipole
is the dominant contribution.
The electrostatic interaction depends on the relative
orientation of the molecules [3]. For example, the dipole-
dipole interaction is attractive for head-to-tail orienta-
tions, whereas it is repulsive for side-to-side approach.
Orienting or aligning molecules in space requires exter-
nal fields [4, 5]. Without external fields, molecules are
allowed to rotate freely such that in the frame of the lab
their average dipole moment is zero. This means that for
molecules in pure rotational states, the first-order dipole-
dipole interaction vanishes. One exception to this is when
two molecules are in rotational states that differ by one
quantum. In this case the rotational excitation can reside
on either molecule, and the dipole-dipole interaction cou-
ples these two states leading to a resonant dipole-dipole
interaction [6].
The dipole-dipole interaction can couple to excited
states of the molecule-molecule dimer, which in second-
order perturbation theory gives rise to a van der Waals
interaction given by −C6/R6[7] with van der Waals
coefficient C6. We can distinguish between the contri-
butions of virtual excitations to electronically excited
states, Celec
6, and contributions of virtual excitations to
∗tkarman@science.ru.nldifferent rotational states of both molecules within the
electronic ground state, Crot
6[8]. The electronic contribu-
tion is what is typically thought of as the van der Waals
interaction [1]. For many bialkali molecules the rota-
tional contribution is two orders of magnitude larger [9],
due to the small rotational excitation energy (0.1 cm−1)
compared to electronic ones (10 000 cm−1). The elec-
tronic contribution to the van der Waals interaction is
almost always attractive, which is a result of the spec-
trum of electronic states which generally becomes denser
for more highly excited states. We show that while the
rotational van der Waals attraction is also attractive for
two molecules in the same rotational state, the interac-
tion between molecules in different rotational states is al-
ways repulsive. This results directly from the structure of
the rotational energy levels which –unlike the electronic
spectrum– becomes sparser for higher excitations.
In a thermal gas of molecules, many different rotational
states may be populated and collisions between molecules
happen at energies higher than rotational energies. In
such a situation, the collision dynamics is determined
by interactions at relatively short distances, where they
become comparable to the collision energy, and hence
are strong compared to the energy difference between ro-
tational states. Therefore one typically does not think
of the interaction as first and second-order perturbative
couplings between pairs of rotational states [1]. How-
ever, it has become possible to prepare molecules in a
single rotational state and at ultracold temperatures of
around a microkelvin while having precise control over
the molecules using external fields [10–13]. At these in-
credibly low temperatures and collision energies, the col-
lision dynamics is determined by long-range interactions.
Of particular interest are molecules that posses a size-
able permanent dipole moment (e.g., NaK, KCs). For
these molecules the rotational contribution to the van der
Waals interaction is by far dominant over the electronic
one [9].
In order to create stable quantum gases of molecules
that can be used as a platform for quantum technologies,
one needs to suppress the loss of molecules due to colli-
sions [14–19]. Even for chemically nonreactive molecules
fast losses are observed, which could result from long-
lived complex formation [20–22]. Shielding moleculesarXiv:2401.05958v4  [physics.atom-ph]  15 May 20242
from collisions by creating repulsive interaction poten-
tials has been realized using static electric fields [23–26]
and microwaves [27–31]. We show in this paper that
loss can also be suppressed in collisions between two
molecules in different rotational states without the need
of external field control. We consider exploiting these in-
teractions in several applications. First, an exciting idea
is to leverage these interaction towards efficient forced
evaporation of a fermi mixture of molecules in different
rotational states. This intuitively appears possible since
collisions between molecules in the same rotational state
are suppressed by the p-wave centrifugal barrier, and loss
ins-wave collisions between distinguishable molecules in
different rotational states is strongly suppressed by the
repulsive interactions, while these still lead to elastic col-
lisions and thermalization. Unfortunately we find that re-
alistically the ratio of good-to-bad collisions remains lim-
ited. Promising applications that we consider are in sup-
pressing loss in on-site encounters of fermionic molecules
in an optical lattice for quantum simulation, as well as
studying impurity physics with controlled dipolar inter-
actions while suppressing collisional loss.
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section II dis-
cusses qualitatively the dipole-dipole interaction between
molecules in different rotational states in more detail,
quantitatively calculates strength of the rotational van
der Waals interaction, describes higher multipoles as well
as the electronic contribution to the van der Waals inter-
action, and characterizes pairs of rotational states that
are degenerate for which the collision dynamics is vastly
different; Section III provides computational details, il-
lustrates interaction potentials for NaK and KCs for var-
ious rotational pairs, computes collisional loss rates by
means of quantum scattering calculations, shows that a
dipole can still be induced using static electric fields and
microwaves, and explains the loss rates observed for de-
generate rotational pairs; Section IV describes potential
applications utilizing repulsive interactions for the evap-
oration of fermi mixtures, fermions in optical lattices and
impurity physics; and Section V concludes this paper.
II. MOLECULE-MOLECULE INTERACTIONS
A. Dipole-dipole interaction
The leading term in the multipole expansion of the
electrostatic interaction between two neutral molecules
is the dipole-dipole interaction. Dipolar interactions
only couple rotational states jandj±1. For a pair
of molecules, this selection rule holds for each molecule
separately. In second-order perturbation theory, the in-
teraction strength is determined by virtual dipole-dipole
(de-)excitation to other states. This strength is propor-
tional to the square of the coupling and inversely pro-
portional to the energy difference between the states, see
Eq. (2) for more detail. This means that the interaction
is dominated by coupling to states closest in energy andthat the sign of this energy difference determines whether
the interaction is attractive or repulsive.
The rotational energy ladder is given by Ej=Bj(j+
1), with rotational constant B. In contrast to electronic
states, where the excited levels become more closely
spaced, excited rotational levels become sparser. This
unique structure results in attractive interactions when
∆j= 0 and repulsive ones when ∆ j≥2, where ∆ j=
|jA−jB|denotes the difference in rotational states be-
tween the two molecules. We discuss the separate cases
in more detail.
The van der Waals interaction is always attractive for
two molecules in the same rotational state j. This is
easiest to see when both molecules are in their rotational
ground state. When jA=jB= 0, the only possible
second-order coupling is to a state higher in energy, where
both molecules are virtually excited to j= 1. This results
in an attractive interaction where Crot
6=d4/6Bwith
dipole moment d. If both are in the same j >0 state,
there are also contributions from de-excitation of one or
both molecules. Excitation of a molecule always yields a
larger energy difference Ej+1−Ej= 2B(j+ 1) than de-
excitation Ej−Ej−1= 2Bjdue to the structure of the
rotational energy ladder. The pair state that lies closest
to the jA=jB=jstate is the one where jAis excited
andjBis de-excited, or vice versa, which is higher in
energy by 2 B, e.g., E1+E1< E 0+E2. In second order,
this leads to an attractive van der Waals interaction when
both molecules are in the same rotational state.
When ∆ j= 1, e.g., the pair state jA+jB= 0+1, they
experience dipole-dipole interactions in first order due to
resonant interactions with 1 + 0. This interaction scales
with R−3and results in fast collisions.
For ∆ j≥2, the interaction is again second order.
Since the molecules are in different rotational states, it
now matters whether one excites the one in the lower
rotational state j<and de-excite the higher rotational
state j>, or vice versa. The smallest energy difference
is found to be excitation of the j<molecule and de-
excitation of j>. This state lies below the state of in-
terest by ∆ E=−2B(j>−j<−1). Figure 1 shows this
schematically. In second order, this therefore results in a
repulsive interaction.
In addition to this qualitative understanding, we quan-
titatively determine the rotational van der Waals coeffi-
cients, Crot
6, for various pairs of rotational states. The
dipole-dipole interaction between two molecules is given

FIG. 1. Schematic representation of rotational energy
levels for (a) two molecules in different rotational states
(here, j= 1 and j= 3) and (b) the combined pair (here,
j+j′= 1 + 3). Different colors represent the various ways of
virtually (de-)exciting the molecules via dipole-dipole interac-
tions, creating strong second-order coupling to a state barely
below the original state.
In practice we used a space-fixed basis set with func-
tions|n⟩=|(jA, jB), jAB, L;JMp⟩and energies En=
B[jA(jA+ 1) + jB(jB+ 1)], see Sec. III A for a detailed
description. Here, the quantum number jABrepresents
the coupled angular momentum of jAandjB,Lthe an-
gular momentum number associated with end-over-end
rotation, Jthe quantum number of the total angular
momentum, Mthe total angular momentum along a
space-fixed quantization axis, and p=±1 corresponds
with the permutation symmetry of bosons (+1) and
fermions ( −1) such that if jA=jBonly basis functions
where p= (−1)jA+jB−jAB+Lcontribute. Since jA=jB
channels couple by dipole-dipole only to channels with
|jA−jB|= 0 or 2, the differences between bosons and
fermions disappear for ∆ j >2. The electrostatic interac-
tions are diagonal in J,M,p, and are independent of M.
ForL= 0 channels, jAB=Jand hence jABis effectively
a good quantum number within the s-wave channels.
We calculate Crot
6for the L= 0 states, although in
the basis we also include L= 2 to account for dipole-
dipole coupling. The values for different pairs of jAand
jBin units of d4/Bare given in Table I and a visual
representation is shown in Fig. 2. Due to the anisotropy
of the dipole-dipole interaction, the second-order inter-
action depends on jABforjA, jB>0. In the figure we
have averaged over the various possible ways of coupling
tojABfor each pair and only show results for bosonic
molecules, although the case of fermionic molecules is
qualitatively very similar. Moreover, since the dominant
interaction for ∆ j= 1 is first order, not second order,
these values are not given.TABLE I. Rotational van der Waals Crot

FIG. 2. Rotational van der Waals Crot
6coefficients on
a logarithmic scale for pairs of bosonic molecules in various
rotational states jAandjB. For each pair, an average is taken
over the various ways of coupling both together.
From Table I and Fig. 2 we can clearly see the at-
tractive van der Waals interaction when jA=jB. For
all other pairs where ∆ j≥2 the interaction is repul-
sive. This decreases in strength as ∆ jincreases, since
the energy difference between the prepared and virtually
(de-)excited states increases.4
B. Higher multipoles and electronic contribution
Higher-order multipole-multipole interactions also play
a role. For a multipole of rank l, the selection rules that
couple a rotational state jto some state kare given by
the the triangular condition |j−k| ≤l≤j+kand the
parity rule that j+k+lmust be even. Therefore, if both
j, k > 0, there are various multipoles that contribute to
the full electrostatic interaction. For multipoles of rank
lAandlBthis contribution scales as R−lA−lB−1. The
dipole-dipole interaction that scales as R−3is therefore
typically dominant. In special cases of degeneracy, see
Secs. II C and III E, we find that, for example, dipole-
quadrupole can occur in first order. In other cases, in-
cluding higher multipoles affects the results only quanti-
tatively.
At first glance, it would seem that for states where both
jA, jB>0 quadrupole-quadrupole coupling is possible in
first order, which would scale as R−5. However, in the
s-wave channel this anisotropic interaction has zero ex-
pectation value and the interaction couples the s-wave to
theg-wave channel such that in second order the inter-
action only scales as R−8.
Besides the electrostatic contribution to the van der
Waals interaction, there is still the electronic contribu-
tion. For bialkalis with a sizeable dipole moment, typ-
ical electronic and rotational contributions to the van
der Waals coefficients are Celec
6∼104a.u. and Crot
6∼
d4/B∼106a.u., such that the electronic contribution is
generally two orders of magnitude smaller, although still
present [9]. This holds for molecules such as NaK and
KCs, but not for KRb due to its small dipole moment. In
this work we include this as an isotropic interaction that
is the same for all rotational states. When ∆ j≥2, the
strength of the repulsive interaction decreases for larger
∆j, while the electronic contribution remains constant.
Therefore, for larger ∆ j, the electronic contribution is
important and can completely suppress the repulsive part
of the rotational contribution.
C. Pair degeneracies
For a pair of linear molecules of the same species, the
combined states j+j′can become degenerate with an-
other pair of k+k′rotational states. When this is the
case, the coupling between the two states does not oc-
cur in second order, but in first order, which drasti-
cally changes the interaction and resulting collision rates.
Here, we derive which pairs of rotational pair states are
degenerate, and we discuss the physically most relevant
degeneracies.
If two molecules are the same species, i.e., both have
the same rotational constant B, then degeneracy, which
we denote by j+j′≡k+k′, holds if Ej+Ej′=Ek+Ek′,
which gives
j(j+ 1) + j′(j′+ 1) = k(k+ 1) + k′(k′+ 1) (3)for which we can find integer solutions. By completing
squares and using a2−b2= (a−b)(a+b) one arrives at
(j−k)(j+k+ 1) = ( k′−j′)(k′+j′+ 1).(4)
We then define l=j−kandl′=k′−j′, which correspond
to the lowest rank multipoles that couple the rotational
states. We assume without loss of generality that j > k
andk′> j′. Both sides of Eq. (4) equal the same integer,
where the left-hand side is divisible by land the right-
hand side by l′. This means that any factors that divide
lbut not l′, should divide k′+j′+ 1. Equation (4)
must therefore equal an integer of the form nll′/gcd(l, l′),
where nis any positive integer and gcd( l, l′) the greatest
common divisor of landl′. This leads to j+k+ 1 =
nl′/gcd(l, l′) and k′+j′+ 1 = nl/gcd(l, l′), and together
with the definitions of landl′this yields
j=k+l ,
j′=1
2nl
gcd(l, l′)−l′−1
,
k=1
2nl′
gcd(l, l′)−l−1
,
k′=j′+l′.(5)
These only give integer solutions if
1. both l, l′are odd and nis even, or
2.lis odd, l′is even (or vice versa) and nis odd, or
3. both l, l′are even, containing the same power of 2
in their prime factorization, and nis odd.
The last requirement shows, for example, that for l= 2
andl′= 4 there are no degeneracies, while for l= 2 and
l′= 6 there are. Positivity of all quantum numbers is
ensured in both cases if n≥gcd(l, l′) max(l+1
l′,l′+1
l) and
l, l′≥1. Given landl′as restricted above, one can then
generate a family of degenerate states parametrized by
n.
Equation (3) can be extended to higher degrees of de-
generacies, where finding different degenerate pairs be-
comes mathematically equivalent to finding the different
ways of writing an integer as a sum of two squares of
odd numbers. For example, for a three-fold degeneracy,
the lowest integer for which this holds is 650, resulting in
8 + 9≡5 + 11 ≡2 + 12.
We find all degenerate pairs that are coupled by dipole-
dipole interactions, where l=l′= 1. From the recipe
above these are given by
1 + 0≡0 + 1 ,
2 + 1≡1 + 2 ,
3 + 2≡2 + 3 ,etc.
In general, for l=l′, one finds the trivial solutions j+j′≡
j′+j, which correspond to the known resonant multipole-
multipole interactions.5
For dipole-quadrupole coupling, where l= 1 and
l′= 2, we find non-trivial degenerate pairs. Following the
recipe above, we must take n= 3,5,7, .... The degener-
ate pairs are then of the form n+n−3
2≡n+1
2+ (n−1).
So, for increasing nwe find the degenerate pairs
3 + 0≡2 + 2 ,
5 + 1≡3 + 4 ,
7 + 2≡4 + 6 ,etc.
Exact degeneracies as described above only hold for
rigid rotors, where no centrifugal distortion is taken into
account. In reality, centrifugal forces pull the atoms
apart and the usual equation for the rigid rotor energy
levels is extended to
Ej=Bj(j+ 1)−Dj2(j+ 1)2, (6)
with D≪Bthe centrifugal distortion constant. This
splits the ‘degenerate’ states by a small amount com-
pared to the rotational level spacing. The interaction
potentials then contain a crossing between the two cou-
pled states, which can significantly change the dynamics
of the collision compared to non-degenerate states.
Of special interest is the 3+0 ≡2+2 degeneracy. The
centrifugal distortion lifts this degeneracy such that the
3 + 0 state is slightly lower in energy. The dipole-dipole
interaction leads to an attractive van der Waals interac-
tion for the 2 + 2 state and a repulsive van der Waals
interaction for the 3 + 0 state. The dipole-quadrupole
coupling between these nearly degenerate states creates
a repulsion between them, possibly stabilizing the upper
2 + 2 state and destabilizing the 3 + 0 state. We explore
this idea quantitatively in section III E.

we refer to the Supplemental Material of Ref. [27]. Note

We make use of an uncoupled basis set, where we ex-
press the basis functions of the monomers using angular
momentum states |jmj⟩. The end-over-end rotation of
the molecules about one another is described by the state
|LML⟩. Lastly, in the case where we include microwaves,
the basis also contains a photon state |N⟩representing
the number of photons taken up by the complex. The
full dimer basis functions are then of the form
|j(A)m(A)⟩|j(B)m(B)⟩|LML⟩|N⟩. (11)
The resulting basis can be reduced by adapting it to per-
mutation symmetry and restricting good quantum num-
bers [27]. We perform separate calculations for the two
parities of ( −1)jA+jB+Las well as for different values
ofMtot=m(A)+m(B)+ML. For convergence, we
have used a basis up to Lmax= 7,|ML,in|max= 1 and
jmax= max( j(A)
in, j(B)
in) + 2 for all calculations, with ‘in’
representing the initially prepared rotational state. For
states where ∆ j= 1, we have converged the results up
to|ML,in|max= 5 due to the strong resonant coupling.6
When microwaves are included the basis also contains
N= 0 and −1. For the results including electric fields
or microwaves results are converged by including up to
jmax= 3 and |ML,in|max= 3. In all cases, results are
converged within 1 %.
Using the Hamiltonian as defined in Eqs. (7) and (8)
and the dimer basis set (11), we calculate loss rates by
coupled-channels scattering calculations using the renor-
malized Numerov method [32]. We propagate two sets of
linearly independent solutions on a radial grid. At short
range we impose absorbing boundary conditions to model
the short-range losses of ultracold molecules and at long
range S-matrix boundary conditions [33]. The absorb-
ing boundary assumes that at the boundary there is only
flux going into short-range reactive channels, leading to
100 % loss for these channels, as observed experimentally
[14–19]. At short enough distances our results are insen-
sitive to the exact placement of the boundary condition.
Calculations were converged with respect to the radial
grid, which ranges from 50 to 10 000 a0with at least
10 points per local de Broglie wavelength. After propa-
gation, this results in a scattering S-matrix from which
we get all state-to-state scattering probabilities. Colli-
sional loss depends on the probabilities of short range
and inelastic collisions. The cross sections for these loss
mechanisms follow from the S-matrix as

We integrate using 7 logarithmically spaced collision en-
ergies between 0 .1Tand 10 T. All results in this paper
are given for T= 1µK.
The molecules that we study here are NaK and KCs
[15, 34, 35]. Both have a large dipole moment [36, 37],
a small electronic contribution to the long-range interac-
tion [9], and both are non-reactive [38]. Moreover, due to
the available isotopes of K, both bosonic and fermionic
NaK and KCs can be produced. Note that the theory
presented above applies generally for other dipolar, lin-
ear molecules for which the rotational contribution tothe van der Waals interaction is dominant. The molecu-
lar parameters used for NaK are B= 9.41×10−2cm−1,

with Rethe equilibrium bond distance.
B. Interaction potentials
We find adiabatic interaction potentials by diagonal-
izing the dimer Hamiltonian (8), excluding the radial
kinetic energy term, at fixed intermolecular distances
R. For a number of rotational state pairs for bosonic
NaK and KCs these potential energy curves are shown in
Fig. 3. In all panels, the solid blue curve corresponds to
the incoming j+j′state with L= 0, whereas the thin
gray curves correspond to higher L, or different couplings
between jandj′that have higher barriers. These solid
lines are calculated including only the dipole-dipole inter-
action but excluding the dipole-quadrupole, quadrupole-
quadrupole and electronic terms.
With both molecules in the ground rotational state
(j+j′= 0 + 0) in Fig. 3(a) we find the well-known
attractive van der Waals interaction with Crot
6=d4/6B.
For the 0+1 pair, panel (b) demonstrates the strong reso-
nant R−3dipole-dipole interaction. Note that the energy
scale for this panel has been extended by two orders of
magnitude. In panels (c)-(e) we show the pairs 0 + 2,
1+3 and 1+4, respectively, where ∆ j≥2. As discussed
in section II, this results in a repulsive rotational van der
Waals interaction at long range as shown by the dashed
second-order R−6curve. However, there is a distance
below which the perturbative approach breaks down. At
very short distances, the molecules polarize one another,
and ultimately the lowest interaction potentials become
attractive. At intermediate distances, this results in a
potential barrier that can shield collisions at low enough
collision energy. The main loss mechanism at low colli-
sion energy then stems from tunneling through this bar-
rier and reaching the short range, which depends on the
height and width of the barrier as well as the mass of
the colliding molecules. Panel (f) finally shows the 0 + 2
pair for bosonic KCs, where a similar, though lower bar-
rier is compared to NaK. Potential curves including the
isotropic electronic van der Waals interaction are shown
in panels (c)-(f) as the dash-dotted lines. This decreases
the barrier heights and widths, though not by so much
as to remove the barrier in these cases. For state pairs
with larger ∆ j, where the repulsive Crot
6becomes small
compared to the attractive Celec
6, the barrier disappears
and higher losses are again expected.
In Figs. 3(c) and (f) we also include dipole-quadrupole
and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, which decrease
the barrier width and height slightly. This occurs even in
cases where we expect no contribution to the s-wave po-7

1 + 4 and (f) KCs 0 + 2, with dimer rotational states labeled as j+j′where mj=mj′= 0. All potentials are referenced to the
energy of the initial state (solid blue lines) at infinite separation. Due to strong first-order interactions for 0 + 1, the energy is
scaled by 100 in panel (b). The pure second-order rotational interaction curve is given by the dashed light blue curve. Addition

tential from perturbation theory. The electrostatic inter-
action cannot be described perturbatively at the position
of the barrier. The various states then mix, where espe-
cially the rotational quantum numbers jandLcease to
be good quantum numbers.Level repulsion between the
various states lowers the lowest potential curve, and low-
ers the height of the potential barrier of interest.
C. Collisional loss rates
We calculated loss rates for a range of rotational state
pairs j+j′with mj=mj′= 0 for bosonic and fermionic
species of NaK and KCs at 1 µK, which are shown in
Fig. 4. The dashed line in panel (a) only contains dipole-
dipole interactions, whereas the full calculations in all
panels further include dipole-quadrupole, quadrupole-
quadrupole, isotropic electronic Celec
6and centrifugal dis-
tortion terms. The last term is important for the degen-
erate 0 + 3( ≡2 + 2) and 1 + 5( ≡3 + 4) states due to
strong dipole-quadrupole interactions. We explore this
further in section III E.
For 0 + 0 collisions we find loss rates close to universal
loss [42], as expected. For bosonic and fermionic NaK,
universal loss rates at 1 µK are 6 ×10−10and 6 ×10−11
cm3/s, respectively, and for KCs 3 ×10−10and 1×10−10
cm3/s. For fermions, the universal loss rate scales lin-
early with temperature due to the presence of the p-wave
centrifugal barrier, and hence the rate is lower than for
bosons. Similar loss rates are found for 1 + 1 collisions.The highest loss rates we find when ∆ j= 1 due to strong
resonant dipole-dipole interactions, which holds here for
0+1≡1+0 and 1+2 ≡2+1 pairs. For the states where
∆j≥2 one can see from the dipole-dipole calculations
that loss rates decrease rapidly by orders of magnitude
as a function of ∆ jas the attractive interactions occur
at shorter distances, creating a higher and wider barrier.
Dipole-quadrupole, quadrupole-quadrupole and elec-
tronic terms lower the barriers or even cause them to
disappear, especially at larger ∆ j, where the rotational
contribution decreases. We find that the loss rates can
be orders of magnitude smaller than universal loss. Since
the barrier for KCs is generally lower than for NaK, loss
rates for KCs at larger ∆ jare higher than for NaK.
The interaction between molecules is anisotropic for
nonzero jandj′, which leads to a dependence on mjand
m′
j. We explore this dependence by calculating loss rates
for bosonic NaK 1 + j′states with different mjandmj′,
as shown in Fig. 5. The solid line in Fig. 5 corresponds
to the dashed line in Fig. 4(a). The various markers then
show the spread in loss rates, which are at most an order
of magnitude, which still shows that irrespective of the
choice of mjandm′
j, loss rates are suppressed for ∆ j≥2.
We investigate the dependence on various molecular
parameters by artificially scaling the mass, the rotational
constant, the dipole moment and the quadrupole mo-
ment. Results are given in Fig. 6, where the two panels
show results for NaK and KCs, respectively. We note
that both panels exhibit qualitatively similar behavior.
As the rotational constant is increased, the barrier shifts8

to shorter distances with decreasing width and increas-
ing height, changing the loss rates only by a small factor.
The effect of scaling of the dipole moment is most pro-
nounced and shows that for both NaK and KCs the phys-
ical dipole moment results in smallest losses. Decreasing
the dipole moment has the effect that the quadrupole
couplings and the contribution from Celec
6become rela-
tively more important, such that losses increase. Below∼0.3dthis has the effect that the loss rate plateaus as
the barrier disappears. Increasing the dipole moment in-
creases the repulsive van der Waals interaction, but also
strengthens the attractive dipole-dipole interactions at
short distances. As a result, the barrier shifts to larger
distances, resulting also in faster losses. Reducing the
quadrupole moment has no effect as it does not deter-
mine the barrier. When we increase the quadrupole mo-
ment, the quadrupole couplings between the potential
curves become strong enough such that level repulsion
lowers the barrier of the lowest adiabatic potential and
increases loss rates.
Surprisingly, we find that the dependence on mass is
relatively weak. There are actually two competing ef-
fects. First, the loss is determined by the rate of tun-
neling through the repulsive potential, and for a mass-
independent potential one expects a steep suppression of
the loss rate as the mass is increased. The other effect
is that, perhaps surprisingly, even the L= 0 potential is
mass dependent at short enough distances. As mentioned
in the previous section, the barrier arises due to coupling
by anisotropic interactions to other nearby states, includ-
ing higher Lstates. The centrifugal barrier for higher L
states depends on mass and when the perturbative treat-
ment breaks down, the coupling to such states results
in the barrier also becoming mass-dependent. This is
in stark contrast with the s-wave interaction potential
for isotropic interactions, which is mass independent. As
mass increases, the barrier height decreases, resulting in9

their near-cancellation results in the weak mass depen-
dence observed in Fig. 6.
D. Adding electric fields and microwaves
The applications of ultracold molecules rely on their
permanent dipole moment. These dipole moments, how-
ever, are not oriented in the lab frame. To access the
molecules’ dipole moments, one can apply a static elec-
tric field to orient the molecules and thereby align the
dipole moments along the field axis [16, 43, 44]. Alter-
natively, microwaves can be used to induce an oscillating
dipole moment along the polarization direction, leading
to an equivalent time-averaged interaction [43, 45]. Ide-
ally, these molecules that exhibit long-range dipole-dipole
interactions would also be stable with respect to colli-
sions. Above, we have demonstrated that, in the absence
of such fields, collisional loss of ultracold molecules can
be suppressed by preparing molecules in j+j′= 0 + 2
rotational states. Here, we investigate whether the sup-
pression of loss rates of NaK in j+j′= 0 + 2 persists
in the presence of external fields. We note that in ex-
ternal fields jis strictly not a good quantum number,
and we label the field-dressed states with the value of j

Including a static electric field, we show in Fig. 7(a)
loss rates for bosonic and fermionic NaK 0 + 2 states
as a function of electric field strength. We find that for
field strengths up to around 2 kV/cm both bosons and
fermions retain low collision rates until losses rise up to
around universal loss again. In Fig. 7(b) we show the
dipole moment that is induced for different rotational
states as the electric field strength is increased. Within
the range of low collision rates a fraction of the perma-
nent dipole moment can still be induced, especially for
thej= 0 state.
In Fig. 8, we show loss rates for bosonic NaK 0 + 2
dressed with microwaves. We use linearly polarized mi-
crowaves red detuned from the j= 1→2 transition
for both |2,0⟩and|2,1⟩rotational states [43]. We fix the
Rabi frequency Ω to 2 π×10 kHz and scan the detuning ∆
from the transition. The induced dipole moment is then
defined as the effective dipole arising from the dipole-
dipole interaction [43]. The largest dipole moments that
can be induced for |0,0⟩|2,0⟩and|0,0⟩|2,1⟩, respectively,

From Fig. 8 we then find that relatively small loss rates

shown here, circularly polarized microwaves yield very
similar results.
Static electric and microwave fields can still be used to
induce a fraction of the dipole moment, while collisional
loss is kept low.
E. Interactions at pair degeneracies
We have discussed in section II C that pairs of rota-
tional states contain degeneracies for certain combina-
tions of monomer rotational states. The 2 + 2 ≡0 + 3
degeneracy is the one with the lowest rotational quantum
numbers and we now explore this specific case further,
without external fields. These two pairs of states are
coupled by the dipole-quadrupole interaction. In the ab-
sence of that interaction, the 2+2 state has an attractiverotational van der Waals interaction whereas the 0 + 3
state has a repulsive one. What makes this degeneracy
particularly interesting is that the 2+2 state can involve
two molecules prepared in the same |j= 2, m⟩quan-
tum state. Furthermore, the 0 + 3 level is degenerate
with 2 + 2 for rigid rotors, but in reality 0 + 3 is slightly
lower in energy due to centrifugal distortion. Thus, one
can expect level repulsion due to the dipole-quadrupole
coupling between the nearly degenerate states to create
a repulsive potential correlating adiabatically to 2 + 2.
That is, dipole-quadrupole coupling to the nearly degen-
erate 0 + 3 threshold may cause molecules in j= 2 to be
collisionally stable without the need for active shielding.
The interaction curves for 2+2 and 0+3 are presented
in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b), respectively, where mj=mj′= 0.
We see the small lifting of degeneracy by about 80 µK
between the two states due to centrifugal distortion of
the molecules. The L= 0 initial channels for the states
j+j′≡2+2 and 3+0 have opposite parity, and the two
sets of potentials are shown in panels (a) and (b), respec-
tively. The rotational van der Waals interaction is attrac-
tive in the upper threshold and repulsive in the lower one,
leading to crossings between the potential curves. The
crossings are avoided due to the dipole-quadrupole cou-
pling between the states. However, the crossings occur
where the 2+2 potential is already attractive and the lo-
cal kinetic energy makes it unlikely that these crossings
would be traversed adiabatically. For the 0 + 3 state,
the effect of the avoided crossings is to greatly reduce
the barrier height, which can negatively impact the col-
lisional loss rates.
We compute loss rate coefficients as a function of an
artificial scaling applied to the dipole and quadrupole
moments as well as the distortion constant and calcu-
late collisional loss for the 2 + 2 and 0 + 3 initial states,
shown in Figs. 9(c) and 9(d), respectively. For the 2 + 2
state we find high losses across the entire scaling range
of the different parameters. This means that the intrin-
sic shielding that one could have expected for the 2 + 2
state cannot be effective. The main feature in Fig. 9(c)
is the rise in loss as the dipole rises, which is simply due
to the rotational van der Waals potential becoming more
attractive for 2+2. For the 0+3 state rate coefficients are
shown in Fig. 9(d), and here we find different effects. For
reduced quadrupole moments, the coupling to the 2 + 2
state is reduced, and the loss rate approaches the lower
loss rate expected for the 0 + 3 repulsive van der Waals
potential. At increased distortion constants, the loss rate
decreases slightly as the barrier for 0+3 increases due to
the avoided crossing with the 2+2 potential being moved
outwards to where that potential is less attractive. Vary-
ing the dipole moment changes the repulsive interaction
of 0 + 3, the attractive interaction of 2 + 2 and the cou-
pling between them. The dependence of the loss rate is
therefore not as simple. For all realistic parameters, cou-
pling between the nearly degenerate states is not strong
enough to shield the upper state, but it does increase the
loss rate for the lower one.11

IV. APPLICATIONS FOR COLD MOLECULES
The biggest limitation of the stability of ultracold
molecular systems is collisional loss. In “shielding”, ex-
ternal fields are used to reduce collisional losses [23–30].
We discussed in this paper that by an appropriate choice
of two rotational states j, j′such that ∆ j≥2 repulsive
interactions can be realized without requiring external
field control. Here, we consider several possible applica-
tions of these interactions: evaporating a fermi mixture,
fermionic molecules in an optical lattice, and stable im-
purities in an ultracold gas.
A. Evaporation of fermi mixtures
Cooling down to a degenerate quantum gas of fermions
has so far been achieved by assembly from atoms at ultra-
cold temperatures [46–48], and by forced evaporation in
two-dimensional confinement [49] or while shielding using
static electric fields [25, 26] or microwave fields [30, 31].
Efficient forced evaporation requires a high ratio of elas-
tic to inelastic collision rates. For fermions in the same
quantum state, collisions are highly suppressed by the
presence of a p-wave centrifugal barrier. This leads toelastic and inelastic collision rates that are suppressed at
ultracold temperatures by T2andT, respectively.
Our idea here is that one could create a fermi mixture
of molecules in two rotational states, jandj′. Collisions
between molecules in the same rotational state would be
highly suppressed at ultracold temperatures, but “inter-
species” collisions could occur. If ∆ j≥2, the inelastic
rate could be small due to the repulsive rotational van der
Waals interaction. This would leave only inter-species
elastic collisions, which could then enable fast thermal-
ization and efficient forced evaporation. After removal of
molecules in one of the jstates, which could be imple-
mented as collisional removal of the minority species, one
could end up with a state-pure quantum degenerate gas
without active shielding using external fields.
In Fig. 10 we show elastic and inelastic collision rates
for different pairs of rotational states of fermionic NaK.
The 0 + 4 pair performs the best out of the investigated
pairs due to the low collisional loss as was seen in Fig.
4. Compared to the 0 + 0 collisions, the rate for elastic
0 + 3 or 0 + 4 collisions has indeed increased by orders of
magnitude, while especially for the 0+4 pair the inelastic
rate is generally smaller than the elastic one. However,
the increased elastic rate for 0 + 4 is generally not much
higher than the inelastic rate of 0 + 0 and 4 + 4 collisions12

that also occur in the mixture. So while the repulsive
interaction improves the elastic collision rate by orders
of magnitude while keeping the collisional loss rate low,
the ratio of elastic to inelastic collisions is realistically
not high enough to enable direct evaporative cooling.
B. Fermions in optical lattices
In quantum simulation using ultracold molecules in op-
tical lattices [50–52], two molecules can tunnel into the
same lattice site and undergo collisional loss. The re-
pulsive rotational van der Waals interaction can prevent
such losses without actively controlling interactions with
external fields, at least for fermionic molecules in two ro-
tational states with ∆ j≥2. Fermions in the same quan-
tum state will not occupy the same lattice site due to
the Pauli principle. Fermions in distinct quantum states
can meet on site, but will be protected from collisional
loss by the repulsive rotational van der Waals interac-
tion. As shown in Sec. III D, a weak microwave or static
electric field can be applied to access dipolar interactions
between the molecules without compromising the colli-
sional stability.
C. Impurity physics
An ultracold mixture of molecules in different rota-
tional states is also an interesting playground for im-
purity physics [53–55], and enables studying polarons
with long-range interactions. We envision introducing
j= 2 impurities into a gas of j= 0 rotational ground
state molecules, such that the repulsive rotational van
der Waals interaction would render the impurities stablewith respect to collisions with the bath. One can address
the impurity by microwaves tuned on the j= 1→2 tran-
sition, which induces dipole-dipole interactions between
the impurity and the bath molecules selectively, without
inducing dipolar interactions within the bath.
V. CONCLUSION
In this work, we described the electrostatic interaction
between two dipolar, linear molecules that are prepared
in specific rotational states. When both molecules are
prepared in the same rotational state, we recover the well-
known attractive rotational van der Waals interaction.
When the rotational states differ by one quantum, reso-
nant dipole-dipole interactions lead to first-order dipole-
dipole interactions. When the rotational states differ by
two or more quanta, the dominant interaction is a re-
pulsive van der Waals interaction. The repulsive interac-
tions follow directly from the rotational energy levels of
a linear molecule that become sparser as one goes up in
energy, and are therefore universal for polar molecules.
This is in stark contrast to the usual electronic van der
Waals interaction which is typically attractive as gener-
ally electronically excited states become denser at higher
energies.
The repulsive interactions result in a potential barrier
that we computed for NaK and KCs molecules. These
barriers can suppress collisional losses at low tempera-
tures. Using quantum scattering calculations we stud-
ied the ultracold collision dynamics quantitatively and
showed that collisional loss can be suppressed by sev-
eral orders of magnitude below the universal loss rate.
Moreover, we discussed the cases when pairs of rota-
tional energy levels of two molecules become degenerate,
which impacts the collision dynamics. Using static elec-
tric fields or microwaves, a fraction of the limiting dipole
moment can be induced while maintaining a low loss rate.
The repulsive interaction between molecules in differ-
ent rotational states opens up several applications in ul-
tracold physics. A clear application is quantum simula-
tion with fermionic molecules in an optical lattice. Here,
only distinguishable fermionic molecules in different ro-
tational states can tunnel into a single lattice site, and
the repulsive van der Waals interactions can prevent col-
lisional loss and control on site interactions. Another
promising application is impurity physics with rotation-
ally excited molecules immersed in a bath of rotational
ground state molecules, enabling control of dipolar and
repulsive van der Waals interactions between the impu-
rity and bath molecules while suppressing collisional loss.
Further less obvious applications of the repulsive rota-
tional van der Waals interactions may exist. In the ac-
companying paper we show how these interactions can be
used to implement near-deterministic loading of optical
tweezers with laser cooled molecules [56].13
