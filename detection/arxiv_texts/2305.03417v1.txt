Cometary dust particles are the best preserved remnants of the matter present at the onset of the formation
of the Solar System. Space missions, telescopic observations and laboratory analyses advanced the knowledge
on the properties of cometary dust. The only samples with an ascertained cometary origin were returned by the
Stardust space mission from comet 81P/Wild 2. The “chondritic porous” (here called “chondritic anhydrous”)
interplanetary dust particles (CA-IDPs) and micrometeorites (CP-MMs), and the ultracarbonaceous Antarctic
MMs (UCAMMs) also show strong evidence for a cometary origin. Astronomical observations show that
cometary infrared (IR) spectra can generally be modeled using ﬁve families of particles : amorphous minerals
of olivine and pyroxene compositions, crystalline olivines and pyroxenes, and amorphous carbon. From the
analyses of space missions Giotto ,Vega-1&2 ,Stardust ,Rosetta and of CA-IDPs, CP-MMs and UCAMMs, the
elemental composition of cometary dust is generally consistent with the chondritic composition (as deﬁned
by the composition of the CI, or Ivuna-type, carbonaceous chondrites), with the notable exception of elevated
contents in carbon (and possibly nitrogen) compared to CI. As seen in CA-IDPs CP-MMs and UCAMMs,
the organic matter of cometary dust is mixed with minor amounts of crystalline (10% to >25% of the
minerals) and amorphous mineral phases. The most abundant crystalline minerals are ferromagnesian silicates
(olivine and low-Ca pyroxenes), but high-Ca pyroxenes, refractory minerals and low-Ni Fe sulﬁdes are also
present. The crystalline olivine and low-Ca pyroxene compositions can vary from their Mg-rich end-member
(forsterite and enstatite) to relatively Fe-rich compositions. Stardust samples from comet 81P/Wild 2 contain
in particular olivines and pyroxenes with minor element abundances linking them to unequilibrated ordinary
chondrites. Refractory minerals as well as secondary minerals like low-Fe, Mn-enriched (LIME) olivines,
unusual Fe sulﬁdes or mineral aggregates of speciﬁc compositions like Kosmochloric high-Ca pyroxene and
FeO-rich olivine (KOOL grains) are also found in CA-IDPs, CP-MMs and Stardust samples. The presence
of carbonates in cometary dust is still debated (both in astronomical observations and in samples analyzed
in situ or in the laboratory), as well as the presence of hydrated silicates, as proposed after the Deep-Impact
mission. A phyllosilicate-like phase was however observed in a UCAMM, and a CP-MMs shows a mixing
texture with an hydrated part. The abundance of pyroxene to olivine (in numbers) in CA-IDPs, CP-MMs
and UCAMMs is larger than in primitive meteorites (e.g. the Px/Ol ratio is usually larger than 1). GEMS
phases (glass with embedded metals and sulﬁdes) are abundant in cometary dust, although not systematically
found. Some of the organic matter present in cometary dust particle resembles the insoluble organic matter
(IOM) present in primitive meteorites, but amorphous carbon and exotic (e.g. N-rich in UCAMMs) organic
phases are also present. The hydrogen isotopic composition in the organic matter of cometary dust particles
analyzed in the laboratory is usually rich in deuterium, tracing a formation at very low temperatures, either
in the protosolar cloud or in the outer regions of the protoplanetary disk. The presolar dust concentration in
cometary dust can reach about 1% (in CA-IDPs collected during dust streams of comets 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup
and 21P/Giacobini-Zinner), which is the most elevated value observed in extraterrestrial samples. The size
distribution of cometary dust in comet trails is well represented by a power-law distribution (differential size
distribution) with a mean power index N typically ranging from -3 to -4. Polarimetric and light scattering
studies of cometary dust suggest mixtures of porous agglomerates of sub-micrometer minerals with organic
matter, which is compatible with the in situ analyses of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko dust particles by
MIDAS (Rosetta) and with the studies of Stardust samples, CA-IDPs, CP-MMs and UCAMMs. Cometary
dust particles have low tensile strength, and low density, as deduced from observations and analyses of
during the Rosetta mission. The presence of high temperature minerals in cometary dust highlights the need
for a large scale transport mechanism in the early protoplanetary disk. Many gaps in the understanding
of the formation of cometary dust remain, such as the incorporation of minerals from evolved asteroids,
the possibility of aqueous alteration on the comet, the formation of organic matter as well as the mixing
process(es) with minerals and ices, the apparent small presolar heritage...
1arXiv:2305.03417v1  [astro-ph.EP]  5 May 20231. COMETARY DUST : FROM SPACE MISSIONS
TO GROUND-BASED OBSERVATIONS AND TO
THE LABORATORY
Space missions are very powerful in advancing the un-
derstanding of comets. However, the cost and timeline
of such missions have only permitted the characterization
of a limited number of comets so far. Spacecraft ﬂybys
of comet 1P/Halley by Giotto and Vega-1&2 with, re-
spectively, the PIA and PUMA 1&2 instruments, comet
81P/Wild 2 ( Stardust ), comet 9P/Tempel 1 ( Deep Impact ),
comet 103P/Hartley 2 ( Deep Impact -Extended) and the
long duration rendezvous with comet 67P/Churyumov-
Gerasimenko (Rosetta) provided key advancements in our
understanding about the composition and structure of the
cometary dust particles, complementing less costly tele-
scopic observations and laboratory work on cometary mate-
rials captured in the stratosphere and from polar regions and
those returned by the Stardust mission to comet 81P/Wild 2.
Ground-based and space-borne observations of comets
encompass a wide range of spatial scales, spectral ranges
and spectral resolutions. A small perihelion event like with
comet C/2006 P1 (McNaught) (Fig. 1) can produce a spec-
tacular release of small to large particles into the coma and
dramatic comet tail structures that can be modeled to as-
sess coma particle sizes and modulations in dust production
rates.
As the decades advanced from the late 1970s, the in-
struments and telescopes provided increases in sensitivity
and wavelength coverage that allowed multi-epoch studies
in the ’10m window’ and limited studies near 20 m from
ground-based telescopes as well as uninterrupted wave-
length coverage from 5–40m from ISO SWS ,SOFIA ,
Spitzer , and with the majority being single-epoch obser-
vations. The James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) will
provide a greater span of wavelength coverage, which fa-
cilitates the simultaneous use of scattered light and ther-
mal emission studies to characterize the dust composition
and particle properties in cometary comae. Thus, the de-
cline in the availability in mid- and far-IR instrumenta-
tion for photometric and spectroscopic studies of comets on
ground-based telescopes is complimented by higher sensi-
tivity and broader wavelength coverage airborne and space-
based telescopes. Multi-epoch studies have thus far re-
vealed that the dust composition of the coma of an individ-
ual can vary signiﬁcantly with heliocentric distance, poten-
tially due to changes in seasonal illumination that changes
the ’active’ areas and/or changes in jet activity. Also, the
coma’s dust composition can appear to change composition,
i.e., increase the relative abundance of crystalline silicates
because a decrease in heliocentric distance ( rh) causes in-
creases in solar insolation whereby dust components that
are less absorbing of sunlight (e.g., more transparent Mg-
rich crystalline silicates that are less optically active) may
warm sufﬁciently to gain spectral contrast with respect to
more active species (e.g., amorphous carbon and Mg:Fe
amorphous silicates).NASA has been collecting Interplanetary Dust Par-
ticles (IDPs) in the stratosphere ( Warren and Zolensky
1994), following the pioneering work of Don Brownlee
(Brownlee et al. 1977). Several lines of evidence point
to a cometary origin for chondritic anhydrous (CA) IDPs
(Bradley and Brownlee 1986; Bradley 1994a; Bradley et al.
1999) (Fig. 2), including higher atmospheric entry veloci-
ties (as determined by noble gas measurements, ( Nier and
Schlutter 1993)), high particle porosity, anhydrous nature,
high bulk carbon content associated with a high abun-
dance of pyroxenes minerals ( Thomas et al. 1993), short
solar exposure histories, high presolar grain concentrations
(Rietmeijer 1998; Palma et al. 2005; Nguyen et al. 2007;
Busemann et al. 2009; Brownlee et al. 1995; Bradley et al.
2014). We chose here to name these IDPs “chondritic an-
hydrous” whereas they are usually quoted as “chondritic
porous” (or “chondritic porous anhydrous”) in the litera-
ture. This choice was made following the observation that
many hydrous IDPs are equally porous ( Zolensky et al.
1992) so the term ‘chondritic porous’ is somewhat mislead-
ing. Moreover, IDPs having a ﬂuffy-like texture when ob-
served as whole particles do not always contain signiﬁcant
porosity when examined in their interior (e.g. by section-
ing with ultramicrotomy). In the search for cometary IDPs,
timed collections in the stratosphere were performed with
the aim of collecting IDPs during dust streams of comets
26P/Grigg-Skjellerup and 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, but the
expected fraction of collected particles arising from those
particular sources was only a few % ( Busemann et al. 2009;
Bastien et al. 2013). Because of limitations of the collection
technique, no particular IDP can be unambiguously iden-
tiﬁed with a speciﬁc small body, so the question of their
origin(s) is not yet completely resolved. After 50 years
of investigation, links between IDPs and comets remain
hazy, and some IDPs might originate from icy asteroids
(e.g. Vernazza et al. 2015), which could in turn sample the
”asteroid-comet” continuum proposed by Gounelle (2011).
Nevertheless, a tentative consensus has been formed that the
chondritic anhydrous IDPs (CA-IDPs) probably are mainly
of cometary origin. Are any of the hydrous chondritic IDPs
from comets? The discovery of Ca-Al-rich refractory inclu-
sions (CAIs) among 81P/Wild 2 particles could suggest a
cometary origin for some refractory IDPs ( Zolensky 1987;
McKeegan 1987), which have long been ignored. These
IDPs are ﬁner grained than typical meteoritic CAI.
Larger interplanetary dust particles called micromete-
orites (MMs) have also been recovered from polar ice and
snow. They were originally found by Maurette et al. (1986,
1987) in Greenland ice, and later collected at lower tem-
peratures from Antarctic ice, and then snow (e.g. Mau-
rette et al. 1991; Duprat et al. 2007; Dobrica et al. 2009;
Noguchi et al. 2015). These larger particles are gener-
ally more strongly heated during atmospheric entry than
IDPs and may be altered in the terrestrial environment, es-
pecially by leaching when collected from ice where they
can reside for several tens of thousands of years before
collection. The samples collected from snow however do

not show evidence for extensive aqueous alteration ( Duprat
et al. 2007). Extraterrestrial dust particles in the size range
of MMs (200m) constitute the dominant input of ex-
traterrestrial matter on Earth ( Love and Brownlee 1993;
Rojas et al. 2021), and they could have played a role in
the formation of the terrestrial hydrosphere and the origin
of life on Earth (e.g. Maurette 2006). Numerical mod-
elling suggests that 80% of micrometeorites could origi-
nate from comets ( Carrillo-S ´anchez et al. 2016), but they
probably derive from both asteroids and comets. Some
MMs have been found to have identical ﬁne-grained com-
ponents to chondritic-porous IDPs (here called CA-IDPs)
and, thus, these “CP-MMs” sample sources that are most
likely cometary ( Noguchi et al. 2015, 2017). Ultracarbona-
ceous Antarctic Micrometeorites (UCAMMs – Fig. 2) also
constitute a new family of micrometeorites that was re-
cently discovered in the Concordia and Dome Fuji collec-
tions ( Nakamura et al. 2005; Duprat et al. 2010; Yabuta
et al. 2017). They are dominated by organic matter with a
variable (but minor) stony component, show large anoma-
lies of their hydrogen isotopic composition, and most prob-
ably originate from comets. They contain an unusual N-
rich organic matter that could have formed by Galactic cos-
mic ray irradiation of N-rich ices in the outer regions of the
protoplanetary disk ( Dartois et al. 2013, 2018; Aug´e et al.
2016).
This chapter will describe the chemical and physical
properties of cometary dust particles, based on the infor-mation recovered from space missions, ground based tele-
scopic observations and analyses in the laboratory of CA-
IDPs, CP-MMs and UCAMMs. Since this chapter gath-
ers information from very different collecting and/or an-
alytical methods, the following possible biases should be
kept in mind: i) the in situ mass spectrometers at comet
1P/Halley mostly detected very small particles (nanome-
ters) - possibly sub-constituents of larger particles. The
Rosetta /COSIMA mass spectrometer performed analyses
of dust from 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko at the 25 µm
scale, thus averaging the composition of sub-components;
ii) samples returned from the Stardust mission were more
or less altered by the high-speed collection in the aero-
gel, depending on the mechanical strength of the initial
particles; iii) the identiﬁcation of cometary dust composi-
tions from astronomical IR spectroscopy requires a careful
control on observational and analytical parameters, as pre-
sented in section 2.5; iv) information deduced from CA-
IDPs, CP-MMs and UCAMMs can suffer from small num-
ber statistics, and from the poor knowledge of their initial
parent bodies.
2. CHEMICAL PROPERTIES
2.1. Elementary composition
The elementary composition of cometary dust particles
can be determined from ground-based, space missions and
dust samples of very probably cometary origin that are
3collected on Earth : the chondritic-anhydrous IDPs (CA-
IDPs) ( Bradley et al. 2014), the CP-MMs ( Noguchi et al.
2015, 2017), and ultracarbonaceous Antarctic micromete-
orites (UCAMMs) ( Duprat et al. 2010).
Insight into the elemental composition of cometary
dust particles was gathered so far for 4 comets visited by
space missions (1P/Halley, 9P/Tempel 1, 103/Hartley 2,
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko), and from a comet sam-
ple return ( Stardust mission to 81P/Wild2). For comet
1P/Halley, mass spectrometry from Giotto ,Vega-1 and
Vega-2 , of cometary dust impacting at high speeds ( 70-75
km.s 1) determined two populations : the “rocky” (ele-
ments of Mg, Fe, O, S of approximately solar composition)
and the “CHON” particles with elemental abundances en-
hanced over the CI chondritic composition (as deﬁned by
the Ivuna-type carbonaceous chondrites) and the Sun ( Jess-
berger et al. 1986; Jessberger 1999). All particles were in
fact, on some level, mixtures of “rocky” and “CHON” ma-
terials with about one-quarter being predominantly “rocky”,
one-quarter predominantly “CHON”, and half being mixed
with a span of 0.1–10 times CHON/rock elemental ra-
tios ( Fomenkova et al. 1992; Lawler and Brownlee 1992).
The very smallest particles had the greatest C abundances
(Lawler and Brownlee 1992). The bulk composition of
Halley dust particles was chondritic within a factor of two,
with the exception of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, which
were enriched with regard to CI by a factor of 11, 8 and 4,
respectively (Fig. 3).
TheStardust Mission ﬂyby showed that particle streams
in the coma resulted from the disintegration (called “au-
tobrecciation”) of larger particles released from the nu-
cleus at slower speeds ( Clark et al. 2004). Stardust re-
turned samples revealed the presence of a greater fraction
of ’hot inner disk materials’ than assessed from Halley,
including high temperature CAIs, micro-chondrules (100
m- size) spanning Mg- to Fe-rich olivine (crystals), pla-
gioclase, nepheline and graphitic carbon, (see sections 2.2
and 2.4 for more details) ( Zolensky et al. 2006; Nakamura
et al. 2008; De Gregorio et al. 2017).
The impact on comet 9P/Tempel 1, which was created
by the Deep Impact Mission , released particles into the
coma, with coma-gas-accelerated speeds of 200 m/s, that
spectrally appeared to be more similar to the submicron-
sized silicate-rich and crystal-rich comet Hale-Bopp. In the
hours after impact and from ground-based studies of the in-
ner coma, dust compositions varied between highly silicate-
and forsterite-rich to poor relative to (what is ﬁtted as) dark
carbonaceous species ( Harker et al. 2005, 2007; Sugita
et al. 2005). Visible polarization studies revealed the ejec-
tion of surface dark carbonaceous particles ( Furusho et al.
2007). Spectral studies at lower spatial resolution also re-
vealed smaller and more crystal-rich materials in the coma
after impact ( Lisse et al. 2005). The fortuitous explosive
release of matter into the coma of 17P/Holmes similarly re-
vealed smaller particles and more crystal-rich compositions
that were hitherto thought to be associated with Oort cloud
comets like Hale-Bopp ( Reach et al. 2010).The ﬂyby over comet 103P/Hartley 2 showed that the
two sources of volatile gas ’activity drivers’, H 2O and CO 2,
produced a different size and composition in the coma
whereby, compared to the H 2O rich mid-region, the CO 2-
rich end was ejecting ice chunks and organic gases and
probably solid state organics ( A’Hearn et al. 2015; Feaga
et al. 2021).
The comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter
67P/C-G) was studied in detail during the rendezvous
with the Rosetta mission, which orbited the comet from
August 2014 to September 2016. The knowledge base
about particle structures and compositions was consider-
ably expanded by the Rosetta investigations. Cometary
dust in 67P/C-G coma consists mainly of mm-size and
slow-moving (few km. s 1Rotundi et al. (2015)) hierarchi-
cal aggregates ( Mannel et al. 2019) that collapsed to vari-
ous degrees upon collection ( Langevin et al. 2016; Lasue
et al. 2019) (see also section 3.3). The dust mass analyser
COSIMA ( Kissel et al. 2007) collected more than 35,000
particles ( Merouane et al. 2016), and about 250 of them
were analyzed. The ROSINA gas mass spectrometer oc-
casionally captured rock-forming elements like Na, Si, K,
Ca, and Fe in relative abundances suggesting a composition
enriched in Si compared to CI ( Wurz et al. 2015; Rubin
et al. 2022). These atomic species in the gas phase could
originate from solar wind sputtering of dust particles, or
directly from nanoparticles present in the coma. Fe and Ni
atoms could be associated with organics (see section 2.2).
The composition of 67P/C-G dust particles as measured
by COSIMA shows some variability ( Bardyn et al. 2017;
Sansberro et al. 2022) and the average composition of 
30 of these particles was quantiﬁed and showed that dust
was composed of stony material mixed with high molecular
weight solid state organics (45% by mass) ( Bardyn et al.
2017; Fray et al. 2016). The bulk composition of 67P/C-G
dust particles is rather chondritic, except for higher content
of C and possibly N (Fig. 3). A carbon to silicon atomic ra-
tioC=Si = 5:5+1:4
 1:2was measured in 67P/C-G dust particles
(Bardyn et al. 2017) (Fig. 4). This value is about one order
of magnitude larger than the CI value (0:760:10), and
close to the protosolar value (7:190:83,Lodders (2010)).
The H/C ratio is 1:040:16(Isnard et al. 2019), which
is higher than in IOM extracted from the most primitive
meteorites, but lower than the value measured in 67P/C-G
high molecular weight organic molecules that have an av-
erage H/C ratio of 1.56 0.04 ( H¨anni et al. 2022), which
is compatible with that of the soluble organic matter in the
Murchison carbonaceous chondrite ( Schmitt-Kopplin et al.
2010). The average nitrogen to carbon ratio of 67P/C-
G dust particles is N=C = 0:0350:011 (Fray et al.
2017). This value is in turn compatible with the chon-
dritic value (N=C =0:04)(Alexander et al. 2017), but
about one order of magnitude lower than the protosolar
value (N=C = 0:30:1,Lodders (2010)). The discovery
of ammonium salts (in particular ammonium hydrosulphide
and ﬂuoride) in 67P/C-G ( Altwegg et al. 2020b; Poch et al.
2020; Altwegg et al. 2022) could account for this missing
4nitrogen reservoir, as these salts would have sublimated be-
fore analysis in COSIMA. Phosphorus and ﬂuorine were
detected by COSIMA in the dust particles ( Gardner et al.
2020).
The composition of cometary dust in comet 81P/Wild 2
was measured in samples returned by the Stardust mission
(Brownlee et al. 2006; H¨orz et al. 2006). Because of the
high speed collection of the samples, the light elements
could not be quantiﬁed, and volatile elements like S proba-
bly were redistributed around the tracks ( Ishii et al. 2008).
Other elements show a chondritic composition within a fac-
tor of two ( Flynn et al. 2006; Ishii et al. 2008; Lanzirotti
et al. 2008; Leroux et al. 2008; Stephan 2008; Stephan et al.
2008). The bulk composition of cometary dust as discussed
here is displayed in Fig. 3, with the abundances normalized
to Fe and to CI. This kind of representation allows compari-
son with reference values, but should be taken with a hint of
caution, as apparent enrichment/depletions could depend on
the normalizing element (Fe was chosen here). Na and Si
seem systematically enriched in cometary dust. The Na en-
richment was indeed used as a tracer in COSIMA elemen-
tary maps to pinpoint the location of the dust particles, and
was observed during the entry of comet C/2013 A1 (Siding
Spring) in the Martian atmosphere ( Benna et al. 2015).
The composition of CA-IDPs was measured for 24 IDPs
(Thomas et al. 1993; Keller et al. 2004) for all elements
displayed in Fig. 3, except for N, K, and Ti, and for 91
IDPs for major elements (Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe) ( Schramm
et al. 1989). These IDPs show a fairly chondritic composi-
tion, with an enrichment in C of about 5 times the CI value,
which seems correlated with a mineralogy dominated by
pyroxenes ( Thomas et al. 1993) (see also section 2.4.3).
The composition of 10 UCAMMs was measured by elec-
tron microprobe and show large ranges of variations, as
seen in Fig. 3. Within this large variation range, the com-
positions are compatible with CI, except for C and N which
are markedly enriched in UCAMMs with regard to the CI
composition.
Figure 4 displays the C/Si atomic ratio in different kinds
of Solar System material, ordered by increasing values. We
can note that data available for cometary dust and CA-IDPs
are compatible with that of the Sun and of ISM dust. Ob-
jects formed in the inner Solar System show lower values
than the Sun as noted by Bergin et al. (2015). The C/Si
atomic ratio of UCAMMs is very high, even higher than
that of ISM dust, suggesting a local accumulation process
of organics with regard to minerals in the formation regions
of UCAMMs (e.g. Dartois et al. 2018).
2.2. Organics
Cometary dust particles are rich in organic matter. These
organics are present both as volatile compounds mixed with
the host ice phase of the dust particles, and as solid or-
ganic matter in the dust particles themselves. The organ-
ics that are present in the dust particles remain solid when
the comet approaches the Sun, and are thus quoted as “re-fractory” organic matter. They can be studied in samples
in the laboratory, by astronomical observations (depend-
ing on the observations conditions and size of the organ-
ics) or by in situ analyses during space missions. The
volatile organic compounds that have been identiﬁed so far
in cometary dust particles are associated with ice that subli-
mates when the comet approaches the Sun, and can thus be
present in the cometary coma. The Rosetta mission around
comet 67P/C-G allowed a detailed characterization of the
volatiles around the comet, as a function of heliocentric dis-
tance. These volatiles species consist mainly in CH(N)O-
bearing molecules, with a great variety of CH-, CHN-,
CHS-, CHO 2- and CHNO-bearing species, both saturated
and unsaturated ( Altwegg et al. 2017; H¨anni et al. 2022), as
well as the CN radical and related molecules ( H¨anni et al.
2020; H¨anni et al. 2021). Ammonium salts (in particular
ammonium hydrosulphide and ﬂuoride) were also found in
67P/C-G coma and at the nucleus’ surface ( Altwegg et al.
2020b, 2022; Poch et al. 2020). Glycine was identiﬁed in
the gas phase, with a distribution compatible with the subli-
mation of ices associated with the cometary dust particles,
rather than a direct sublimation of ices from the nucleus ( Al-
twegg et al. 2016; Hadraoui et al. 2019, 2021). Glycine had
also been identiﬁed at the surface of Al foil exposed to the
coma of 81P/Wild 2 ( Elsila et al. 2009).
The “refractory” organic matter was identiﬁed as being
present in comet 1P/Halley, but its nature could not be stud-
ied by the Giotto andVega mass spectrometers. Spectral
evidence for aromatic organic molecules, i.e., PAHs were
suggested from UV spectral analyses of comet 1P/Halley
(Moreels et al. 1994; Clairemidi et al. 2008). The very
smallest particles had the greatest C abundances ( Lawler
and Brownlee 1992). CHON particles had a range of H, O,
and N ratios to C ( Fomenkova et al. 1992, 1994).
The high speed collection of 81P/Wild 2 cometary dust
did not allow a good preservation of the organics ( Brownlee
2014; Keller et al. 2006; Sandford et al. 2010). However,
some organic matter, including clumps that were ‘behind’
terminal particles, and therefore somewhat protected from
the heat generated by impact during collection, revealed a
suite of complex organic bonds including mainly alkenes,
aromatic C=C and carboxyl C=O as well as a variety of
textures for the organic matter including organic nanoglob-
ules (Fig. 5) ( Matrajt et al. 2012; De Gregorio et al. 2011;
De Gregorio et al. 2017). The spectral signature of pre-
served organic matter in Stardust samples show similarities
with that of insoluble organic matter extracted from mete-
orites ( De Gregorio et al. 2011), although a reduced form of
carbon was also observed in one Stardust sample ( De Gre-
gorio et al. 2017). The concentration of carbon could not
be quantiﬁed in 81P/Wild 2 samples due to the collection
method in aerogel. The low concentration observed in the
samples is interpreted as a consequence of the harsh col-
lection of the samples. It could also represent a collection
bias of dust from a portion of the coma which was poor in

et al. 2017).

2008), 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G) ( Bardyn et al. 2017), for 10 ultracarbonaceous Antarctic micrometeorites (UCAMMs)
(Dartois et al. 2018, and unpublished data) and for 115 chondritic anhydrous IDPs (CA-IDPs) ( Thomas et al. 1993; Keller et al.
2004; Schramm et al. 1989) (not all elements were measured for all CA-IDPs, see text). Error bars represent the variation range
of the elemental compositions among cometary dust particles for the CA-IDPs and UCAMMs samples and for comets 1P/Halley and
81P/Wild2. In the case of comet 67P/C-G, the error bars represent uncertainties on the values, which are higher or equal to the variation
of composition between particles.

et al. 2015), carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) ( Jarosewich 1990),

et al. 2017), ISM dust (e.g. Dartois et al. 2018), the Sun ( Lodders
2010) and the average of 10 UCAMMs ( Dartois et al. 2018, and
unpublished data).
The solid organic matter identiﬁed in 67P/C-G dust par-
ticles also shows similarities with insoluble organic matter
extracted from meteorites (e.g. Alexander et al. 2017), al-
though with a higher atomic H/C ratio ( 1:040:16) (Fray
et al. 2016, 2017; Isnard et al. 2019). The higher H/C ra-
tio found in 67P/C-G could suggest less processing and a
more primitive origin of the organics present in cometary
particles than in IOM. This comparison is however made
between the bulk organic matter for 67P/C-G and the IOM
obtained from meteorites by acid treatments, after removal
of soluble organics. Soluble organics represent only a small
fraction of the carbon in meteorites ( 20%), but they could
account for some of the difference observed between the
H/C ratios of organic matter in 67P/C-G and in IOM. The
O/C atomic ratio in 67P/C-G dust is likely higher than in
meteoritic IOM ( Bardyn et al. 2017). From the COSIMA
analyses, the abundance of organic matter in 67P/C-G dust
particles was estimated at 45wt%, or70 vol% ( Bardyn
et al. 2017; Levasseur-Regourd et al. 2018). The lower
abundance of 528 vol% of organic matter deduced by
Fulle et al. (2016b) from density measurement is due to
the assumption by these authors of an IDP-like composition
that underestimated the carbonaceous content of 67P/C-G.
This solid state organic matter is reminiscent of ”CHON”
in Halley but the techniques available for analyses better re-
veal the complexity and details of this organic matter. The
ROSINA gas mass spectrometer revealed a huge host of
complex molecules, including many S species, through the
fortuitous impact with a dust particle that occurred during
a close ﬂyby of the nucleus ( Altwegg et al. 2017). Glycine,
methylamine and ethylamine, as well as phosphorus, weredetected by ROSINA in the gas phase in 67P/C-G ( Altwegg
et al. 2016). The observations of glycine in the coma can be
explained by the presence of this amino acid in sublimating
water ice in the dust particles ( Hadraoui et al. 2019, 2021).
Reﬂectance spectra of the surface of 67P/C-G also sug-
gest a high abundance of organic matter in the surface mate-
rial, with a darkening material that could be submicrometer-
sized Fe sulﬁdes ( Quirico et al. 2016; Rousseau et al. 2018;
Capaccioni et al. 2015).
Recent observations showed that Fe and Ni atoms are
ubiquitous in cometary atmospheres, even at large helio-
centric distances ( Bromley et al. 2021; Hutsem ´ekers et al.
2021; Manfroid et al. 2021; Guzik and Drahus 2021). The
observed Fe/Ni ratio is about an order of magnitude higher
than the solar value. These elements could not result for
the sublimation of minerals like silicates or Fe sulﬁdes, due
to the low equilibrium temperature of the cometary atmo-
spheres. The correlations observed between the productions
rate of Fe and Ni and of carbon oxides by Manfroid et al.
(2021) suggest that these Fe and Ni emissions could be pro-
duced by the sublimation of Fe and Ni carbonyls (Fe(CO) 5
and Ni(CO 4), which are possible constituents of cometary
or interstellar matter.
CA-IDPs, CP-MMs and UCAMMs are enriched in or-
ganic matter compared to primitive meteorites. Organic
matter in CA-IDPs was studied by Fourier transform in-
frared microscopy (µFTIR) ( Flynn et al. 2003; Keller et al.
2004; Matrajt et al. 2005; Mu˜noz Caro et al. 2006; Mer-
ouane et al. 2014), Raman microscopy ( Wopenka 1988;
Quirico et al. 2003, 2005; Bonal et al. 2006; Mu˜noz Caro
et al. 2006; Sandford et al. 2006; Rotundi et al. 2007;
Rotundi and Rietmeijer 2008; Busemann et al. 2009) and
transmission electron microscopy with electron energy loss
spectroscopy (TEM/EELS) ( Flynn et al. 2003; Keller et al.
2004). The organic content of CP-MMs was studied by
TEM/EELS, Raman microscopy, and X-Ray absorption mi-
crospectroscopy (STXM-XANES) ( Noguchi et al. 2015,
2017, 2022; Yabuta et al. 2015). The organic matter of
UCAMMs was studied by µFTIR, Raman microscopy, IR
nanospectroscopy (AFM-IR) and STXM-XANES ( Dartois
et al. 2018; Mathurin et al. 2019; Gu´erin et al. 2020). Car-
bonaceous materials in CA-IDPs range from hydrocarbon
nanoglobules ( Wirick et al. 2009) to completely graphi-
tized carbon ( De Gregorio et al. 2017), which have been
used as thermometers ( Matrajt et al. 2013). 100 nm-
thick coatings of organics observed on some anhydrous
crystals and GEMS (glass with embedded metals and sul-
ﬁdes) are proposed to have facilitated grain aggregation
(Flynn et al. 2003). Figure 5 displays the µFTIR signa-
ture of organic matter in a CA-IDP after acid treatment
(Fig. 5c) and in UCAMMs without any chemical treatment
(Fig. 5b). The signature of the organics in CA-IDPs shows
a large abundance of polyaromatic organic matter, with aro-
matic carbon, ketone (C=O), carboxylic groups (COOH)
and aliphatic C-H contributions. The organics in CP-MMs
show the signature of aromatic/oleﬁnic carbon, aromatic ke-
tone, and carboxylic carbon. Carbonaceous nanoglobules
7are usually present ( Noguchi et al. 2015, 2017, 2022; Yabuta
et al. 2015). The signature of organic matter in UCAMMs
is unusual, with large amounts of N-bearing species (in-
cluding nitrile), and low signature of C=O and aliphatic
C-H ( Dartois et al. 2013, 2018). STXM-XANES analy-
ses of UCAMMs show that the organics in UCAMMs con-
sist in fact of three distinct organic phases, with different
spectroscopic signatures and different amount of nitrogen
(Engrand et al. 2015; Charon et al. 2017; Gu´erin et al.
2020). The ﬁrst organic phase of UCAMMs is smooth and
N-rich, with N/C atomic ratios up to 0.2. This phase has
no equivalent in meteorites, and could result from the irra-
diation by Galactic cosmic rays of methane and nitrogen-
rich ices at the surface of small bodies in the outer regions
of the protoplanetary disk ( Dartois et al. 2013, 2018; Aug´e
et al. 2016; Aug´e et al. 2019; Rojas et al. 2020). The other
two organic phases identiﬁed in UCAMMs bear similari-
ties with that of chondritic IOM. A carbon-rich clast iden-
tiﬁed as a cometary xenolith in the LaPaz Iceﬁeld 02342
meteorite also shows spectroscopic similarities with mete-
oritic IOM ( Nittler et al. 2019). The peak intensity ratios
of CH 2/CH3measured by µFTIR in aliphatic C-H in CA-
IDPs ( Flynn et al. 2003; Keller et al. 2004; Matrajt et al.
2005; Mu˜noz Caro et al. 2006; Merouane et al. 2014) and
in UCAMMs ( Dartois et al. 2013, 2018) are higher than the
value measured in dust from the diffuse interstellar medium,
which is around 1 ( Sandford et al. 1991; Pendleton et al.
1994; Dartois et al. 2007; Godard et al. 2012).
The Raman signature of OM in CA-IDPs, CP-MMs and
UCAMMs conﬁrm the polyaromatic nature of the solid or-
ganics in these particles, and the low thermal metamorphic
grade of their organic matter ( Wopenka 1988; Quirico et al.
2003, 2005; Bonal et al. 2006; Mu˜noz Caro et al. 2006;
Busemann et al. 2007; Busemann et al. 2009; Rotundi et al.
2007; Rotundi and Rietmeijer 2008; Brunetto et al. 2011;
Noguchi et al. 2015; Dobric ˘a et al. 2011; Dartois et al.
2013, 2018; Starkey et al. 2013). The potential effect of
atmospheric entry heating on the degree of disorder of the
organic matter cannot be ruled out, but speciﬁc experiments
would be needed to study these effects in detail.
Organic nanoglobules seem to be ubiquitous in samples
of cometary origin. They are found in 81P/Wild 2 sam-
ples ( Matrajt et al. 2008; De Gregorio et al. 2010), CA-
IDPs ( Matrajt et al. 2012), CP-MMs ( Noguchi et al. 2015),
and UCAMMs ( Charon et al. 2017) (and also in chondritic
AMMs ( Maurette et al. 1995), for which models predict a
cometary origin for 80% of them ( Carrillo-S ´anchez et al.
2016)).
2.3. Isotopes
The Giotto and Vega missions during a ﬂyby around
comet 1P/Halley led to the rough measurement of carbon
isotopes in cometary dust, but most of the data on the iso-
topic compositions of cometary dust particles were gath-
ered from laboratory analyses of returned cometary samples
(Stardust mission – 81P/Wild 2 comet), from in situ anal-yses ( Rosetta mission on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko –
67P/C-G) or from the analysis of CA-IDPs, CP-MMs and
UCAMMs.
2.3.1. Hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and sulfur isotopes
The hydrogen isotopic composition of comets has been
measured in the gas phase of comets for an increasingly
large number of species (e.g. Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. 2015;
Altwegg et al. 2015; M¨uller et al. 2022, and references
therein), but the in situ measurement of D/H ratios in
cometary dust was only made possible by the Stardust and
Rosetta missions. The D/H ratios of cometary dust parti-
cles is displayed in Fig. 6. The D/H ratio of samples from
comet 81P/Wild 2 ( Stardust mission) were measured by
secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) ( McKeegan et al.
2006; De Gregorio et al. 2010, 2011; Matrajt et al. 2008;
Stadermann et al. 2008). The bulk D/H isotopic ratios of
Stardust samples vary from the terrestrial D/H value (V-
SMOW) of 1.5576 × 10 4to sub-µm sized hotspots that can
reach values up to D2000 permil, which corresponds to
three times V-SMOW. The hydrogen isotopic composition
was also measured in dust particles from comet 67P/C-G
by COSIMA. The average value measured in the organic
matter of 25 cometary particles from 67P/C-G is D/H =
(1.57 ± 0.54) × 10 3(Paquette et al. 2021), which is about
one order of magnitude larger than the terrestrial value,
and marginaly compatible with values measured in organic
molecules in cometary comae ( Meier et al. 1998; M¨uller
et al. 2022). The hydrogen isotopic composition of CA-
IDPs varies between D/H 10 4and D/H4 × 10 3
(Aleon et al. 2001; Busemann et al. 2009; McKeegan et al.
1985; Zinner et al. 1983). The bulk D/H value measured for
eight UCAMMs vary between 3 × 10 4to 1.5 × 10 3,
with µm-sized regions that reach up to 30 times the terres-
trial value ( Duprat et al. 2010; Rojas et al. 2022).
TheGiotto andVega missions to comet Halley allowed
the discovery of isotopically light carbon in the dust parti-
cles (12C/13C5000), providing a possible link to preso-
lar graphite ( Amari et al. 1993) or SiC grains, for which
a few such light values have been measured ( Hoppe et al.
2000; Lin et al. 2002; Nittler and Alexander 2003). The C
isotopic composition of comet Wild2 dust particles in Star-
dust samples varies between 13C-20 and-50 permil
(McKeegan et al. 2006), which are values compatible with
that observed in carbonaceous chondrites ( Alexander et al.
2007) and CA-IDPs ( Messenger et al. 2003). This value is
slightly higher than the solar value determined by the Gene-
sis mission at d 13C = -10520 permil ( Hashizume et al.
2004). The bulk carbon isotopic composition was measured
in three UCAMMs, and vary from 25 permil to-85 per-
mil. A noticeably low isotopic composition at -120 per-
mil is found as a “cold spot” in one UCAMM ( Rojas et al.
2022).
The nitrogen isotopic composition of Stardust samples
shows moderately elevated values, with hotspots of sub-
micrometric sizes reaching values up to 500 permil ( Mc-

(adapted from De Gregorio et al. (2011)); (b) µFTIR spectra of 4 representative UCAMMs ( Dartois et al. 2018); (c) µFTIR spectrum
of organic matter extracted from a chondritic anhydrous IDP ( Matrajt et al. 2005). (d) Energy ﬁltered image at the carbon edge of a

Keegan et al. 2006), which are compatible with values mea-
sured in CA-IDPs ( Messenger et al. 2003; Aleon et al. 2003;
Busemann et al. 2009). The bulk nitrogen isotopic compo-
sition in ﬁve UCAMMs vary from -130 permil to270
permil ( Rojas et al. 2022) (see Fig. 7). In most cases, there
is no correlation between the nitrogen and hydrogen iso-
topic compositions of cometary dust.
The sulfur isotopic composition measured in comet
81P/Wild 2 samples is compatible with the solar value,
showing an extraterrestrial origin of the impact residue and
of the sulﬁde measured ( Heck et al. 2012; Ogliore et al.
2012a). The sulfur isotopic composition of a cosmic sym-
plectite was analysed in Stardust samples, which showed
enrichment in33S (Nguyen et al. 2017). This compositioncould result from photochemical irradiation of solar neb-
ular gas. The sulfur isotopic composition (34S and32S)
of 67P/C-G dust was measured during the Rosetta mission
by COSIMA, and is compatible with the reference value
(Paquette et al. 2017). Due to mass interferences, the33S
isotope could not be quantiﬁed, so a potential33S excess
could not be ruled-out for 67P/C-G dust particles.
2.3.2. O, Si isotopes
The oxygen isotopic composition in extraterrestrial mat-
ter is used as a taxonomic tool, as most meteorite classes
own a given (range of) oxygen isotopic composition(s).
The oxygen isotopic composition of Stardust samples plot
on a slope 1 line and show values which are compatible
9with carbonaceous chondrite signatures, including16O en-
richments for refractory minerals identiﬁed in the Wild2
samples ( Nakamura et al. 2008; Nakashima et al. 2012a;
Joswiak et al. 2014; Ogliore et al. 2015; Defouilloy et al.
2017; Zhang et al. 2021). The oxygen isotopic composition
of 81P/Wild 2 samples shows a correlation between 17O
and the Mg content of the analyzed minerals, as in CR chon-
drites (e.g. Nakashima et al. 2012a; Zhang et al. 2021, and
references therein).
The18O/16O isotopic ratio could be measured by
COSIMA in 67P/C-G dust particles, at18O/16O = 2.0 ×
10 31.2 × 10 4(Paquette et al. 2018). Given the large
error bar associated to this value (due to limitations of mea-
suring isotopic compositions with a ToF-SIMS method),
this value is compatible with the terrestrial V-SMOW value,
and covers the whole range of values found in meteorites.
For reference, the oxygen isotopic composition of H 2O and
CO2in 67P/C-G coma are 2.25 × 10 31.77 × 10 4and
2.02 × 10 33.28 × 10 5, respectively ( Schroeder I et al.
2019; H¨assig et al. 2017). Other gaseous oxygen-bearing
molecules in 67P/C-G can contain heavy oxygen isotopes
compared to V-SMOW, especially for S-rich molecules ( Al-
twegg et al. 2020a).
The oxygen isotopic composition of CA-IDPs is com-
patible with that of 81P/Wild2 samples ( McKeegan 1987;
Al´eon et al. 2009; Nakashima et al. 2012b; Zhang et al.
2021).
The silicon isotopic composition of dust at comet 67P/C-
G could be measured by the ROSINA instrument ( Rubin,
M. et al. 2017) and showed a depletion of heavy silicon
isotopes29Si and30Si compared to the solar value. Such
depletions in heavy isotopes are rare, and only found in rare
presolar grains identiﬁed in meteorites ( Hynes and Gyngard
2009).
2.3.3. Mg isotopes –26Al
The magnesium isotopic composition of 81P/Wild2
samples was measured to search for the past presence of
26Al at the time of mineral formation in comet Wild2. No
resolvable26Mg excess resulting from the decay of26Al
was found in Wild2 samples, suggesting either : i) a late for-
mation (a few Myr after CAI formation) of minerals in Wild
2, ii) a protoplanetary disk heterogeneous in26Al, or iii) the
formation of Wild 2 minerals before injection of26Alin the
protoplanetary disk ( Matzel et al. 2010; Nakashima et al.
2015).
The magnesium isotopic composition measured in
olivines from Stardust samples shows small variations in
26Mg and25Mg values that are compatible with small
mass-dependent fractionation from a chondritic reservoir
with respect to the Mg isotopes ( Fukuda et al. 2021).
2.3.4. Presolar grains
Presolar grains are found in minute amounts in inter-
planetary material. They are grains that were present in
the molecular cloud that led to the formation of the solar
Fig. 6.— D/H ratio measured in solid phase in cometary
dust particles measured in the Stardust samples (81P/Wild 2),
in refractory organics by the Rosetta/COSIMA instrument
(67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko– 67P/C-G), in chondritic anhy-
drous IDPs (CA-IDPs) and UCAMMs. The range of composition
of D/H ratios measured in insoluble organic matter extracted from
carbonaceous chondrites (IOM CCs) and in whole-rock carbona-
ceous chondrites (WR CCs), as well as the terrestrial value (V-
SMOW, in water) and protosolar value (in H2) are also shown
for reference. Data from Alexander et al. (2007); Alexander et al.
(2012); McKeegan et al. (2006); Paquette et al. (2021); Zinner
et al. (1983); McKeegan et al. (1985); Messenger (2000); Aleon
et al. (2001); Busemann et al. (2009); Duprat et al. (2010); Rojas
et al. (2022); Geiss and Gloeckler (1998).
system and survived in the extraterrestrial samples that can
be analyzed in the laboratory. At this time, we can only
identify the isotopically anomalous stardust grains that were
synthesized in previous generations of stars and got incor-
porated in the protosolar molecular cloud ( Hynes and Gyn-
gard 2009; Stephan et al. 2020). Stricto sensu, grains that
formed in the protosolar molecular cloud before the birth of
the Sun are also “presolar”, but cannot be identiﬁed by iso-
topic methods, as they carry the solar signature of the initial
cloud.
In meteorite samples, the most abundant identiﬁed
presolar grains are silicates, whereas SiC and graphite were
historically the ﬁrst ones to be identiﬁed in the acid residue
extracted from meteorites.
As they formed far from the Sun at cold temperatures,
comets are expected to have preserved a large abundance
of presolar grains. After correction for possible partial de-
struction during the harsh collection conditions of Wild 2
samples, isotopically anomalous grains remain rare among
analyzed Wild 2 materials, occurring at initial abundances
of700 ppm ( Nguyen et al. 2020; Stadermann et al. 2008;
Floss et al. 2013). Presolar grains are also found in CA-
IDPs, CP-MMs and UCAMMs in abundances that can
reach up to about 1% ( Busemann et al. 2009; Floss et al.
2012; Floss and Haenecour 2016).

2.4. Mineralogy
2.4.1. Comets 1P/Halley and 67P/C-G : hints at their
mineralogy
In comet 1P/Halley, the “rocky” particles had a wide
range of Mg/Fe but with a narrower range of Mg/Si with
similarities to Mg-rich silicates (40%–60% by number of
particles), speciﬁcally Mg-rich pyroxenes, Fe(Ni) sulﬁdes,
with little Fe metal, and <1% Fe-oxides ( Schulze et al.
1997). CAI-like materials were not found in Halley. Few
particles could be directly traced to pure mineral grains al-
though the 11.2 m spectral feature of forsterite was ﬁrst
identiﬁed in Halley ( Bregman et al. 1987; Campins and
Ryan 1989).
There was no instrument on Rosetta that allowed unam-
biguous identiﬁcation of minerals in dust from 67P/C-G.
The very low reﬂectance of the nucleus surface suggest
the present of opaque minerals, that could be Fe sulﬁdes
(Quirico et al. 2016; Rousseau et al. 2018; Capaccioni et al.
2015). The bulk composition and density of 67P/C-G dust
particles are also compatible with the presence of silicates,
Fe sulﬁdes and carbon ( Bardyn et al. 2017; Fulle et al.
2016a).
2.4.2. 81P/Wild 2 Mineralogy
To date the only samples that are unambiguously derived
from a comet are the 81P/Wild 2 coma dust grains collected
by the Stardust spacecraft, returned to Earth in 2006. Well-
preserved coma grains from comet 81P/Wild 2 are dom-
inated by the coarsest components. Fine-grained materi-
als, representing perhaps 90% of the impacting cometarycoma grains, were severely altered or vaporized during high
speed (6.1 km sec 1) capture in the aerogel capture media
(Brownlee et al. 2006). Fine-grained material was only pre-
served in a minority of cases, but probably sufﬁciently well
to permit elucidation of its general nature ( Ishii et al. 2008).
It is also possible that the apparent lack of ﬁne-grained
amorphous solids could be an artifact of this collection bias.
GEMS, frequently abundant in chondritic anhydrous IDPs
(Bradley 1994a), have not been reliably identiﬁed among
Stardust materials (although there are unveriﬁed reports by
Gainsforth et al. (2016), possibly also due to destruction
during collection and compositional and structural similar-
ities to melted silica aerogel.
As expected, in the Stardust samples the coarse-grained
mineral phases are dominated by olivines, pyroxenes and
sulﬁdes. The compositions are distinct from meteorites
(Joswiak et al. 2012; Frank et al. 2014; Joswiak et al. 2017).
Olivines exhibit practically the entire range from forsterite
to fayalite, with no signiﬁcant compositional peak. Some
terminal olivines are thought to be “micro chondrules” by
their similarity to type II (Fe >10%) chondrules in primi-
tive chondrites such as CRs and CMs ( Frank et al. 2014;
Wooden et al. 2017). The minor element compositions
ofStardust olivines link only a subset to LIME olivine
(condensates) ( Joswiak et al. 2017). One Stardust micro-
chondrule ‘Iris’ reveals its rapid cooling at high oxygen
fugacity and high Na enrichment in the gas phase ( Gains-
forth et al. 2010). The lack of a pronounced compositional
peak at forsterite was very unexpected, as this is a hallmark
of chondritic IDPs ( Rietmeijer 1998) and the least equi-
librated carbonaceous chondrites ( Frank et al. 2014). In
11terms of the olivine and pyroxene compositions, the closest
meteoritic analogues are the unequilibrated ordinary chon-
drites ( Frank et al. 2014). The high abundance of relatively
coarse-grained ( >30m size) ( Frank et al. 2014; Wozni-
akiewicz et al. 2015), well-crystalline ferromagnesian sil-
icates was also unexpected, given laboratory analogue ex-
periments and interstellar dust spectroscopic studies which
indicated that silicates should be mostly amorphous (e.g.
Kemper et al. 2005).
Refractory minerals found in meteoritic calcium alu-
minium rich inclusions (CAIs) were identiﬁed in Wild 2
samples, which contain olivines, pyroxenes, sulﬁdes,
and refractory oxides. Mineral assemblages, mineral
chemistries and measured bulk particle compositions re-
veal that these grains are similar to refractory materials in
chondrites, with mineral chemistries most similar to CAI
from CR2 and CH2 chondrites ( Zolensky et al. 2006; Si-
mon et al. 2008; Chi et al. 2009) and Al-rich chondrules
(Bridges et al. 2012; Joswiak et al. 2014).
Chondrule fragments were also found in Wild 2. They
are similar to chondrules found in carbonaceous chondrites,
but with interesting differences. Few type I chondrules
(FeO- and volatile-poor) have been found from Wild 2,
though these are the most abundant type in meteorites. To
date mainly FeO-, MnO-, volatile-rich type II chondrules
have been identiﬁed from Wild 2 ( Nakamura et al. 2008;
Matzel et al. 2010; Joswiak et al. 2012; Ogliore et al. 2012b;
Frank et al. 2014; Gainsforth et al. 2015). One Al-rich,
16O rich chondrule fragment has also been identiﬁed from
Wild 2, as found in carbonaceous chondrites ( Bridges et al.
2012).
Minor element compositions of Wild 2 olivine and py-
roxenes, particularly Cr and Mn, suggest that Wild 2 experi-
enced mild secondary thermal metamorphism ( Frank et al.
2014), to approximately 400°C. Some Wild 2 olivines and
pyroxenes show compositional similarities to those in or-
dinary chondrites (L/LL), CH, Rumuruti and aubrite me-
teorites ( Frank et al. 2019, and submitted). In addition to
diverse nebular components associated with multiple chon-
drite types, Wild 2 apparently incorporated materials that
were liberated from evolved, internally heated asteroids, an-
other hint for the presence of an early large scale transport
mechanism acting from the inner to the outer regions of the
protoplanetary disk.
A mineral assemblage found in Wild 2 samples consists
of FeO-rich olivines and Na- and Cr-rich clinopyroxenes
(typically augites), sometimes with poorly crystallized al-
bite or albitic glass with spinel ( Joswiak et al. 2009). These
assemblages have been named “KOOL” (Kosmochloric
high-Ca pyroxene and FeO-rich olivine) grains and are ob-
served in more than half of all Stardust tracks. KOOL grains
are also observed in CA-IDPs and CP-MMs. The textures
and mineral assemblages of KOOL grains are suggestive
of formation at relatively high temperatures by igneous or
metamorphic processes (its unclear which) and may have
formed under relatively high fO2conditions. KOOL grains
have not been observed in chondrites, however the oxygenisotopic composition of a single Wild 2 KOOL grain is sim-
ilar to some type II (FeO-rich) chondrule olivines from OC,
R, and CR chondrites ( Kita et al. 2011; Isa et al. 2011).
One type II microchondrule in Wild 2 shows kosmochloric
enhancement possibly reinforcing the link between KOOL
grains and chondrule forming processes ( Gainsforth et al.
2015). KOOL grains may represent an important precursor
material for FeO-rich chondrules.
While no large carbonate grains have been identi-
ﬁed among Wild 2 samples, submicron carbonate grains
have been reported ( Flynn et al. 2009), including Mg-Fe-
carbonates associated with amorphous silica and iron sul-
ﬁdes ( Mikouchi et al. 2007). The observation is interest-
ing because carbonates are typically products of aqueous
processes. While Ca carbonate could plausibly be a manu-
facture contaminant in aerogel, Mg carbonates are unlikely
(Mikouchi et al. 2007). However, in principle carbonates
also can be formed without the presence of liquid water,
in gas-phase reactions in the nebula ( Toppani et al. 2005;
Wooden 2002; Wooden et al. 2017), so the presence of car-
bonates is not an unambiguous signature of cometary aque-
ous alteration.
Sulﬁdes are abundant in Wild 2, at all sizes ( Zolensky
et al. 2006). These are predominantly pyrrhotite (Fe (1 x)S,
x = 0 to 0.2), but unusual sulﬁdes are abundant. Some
pyrrhotites dominate terminal particles often within assem-
blages with igneous textures ( Joswiak et al. 2012; Gains-
forth et al. 2013; Gainsforth et al. 2014). As is generally
the case, pyrrhotite often occurs in association with pent-
landite (FeNi) 9S8, and Fe-Ni metal ( Joswiak et al. 2012).
ZnS (probably sphalerite) is unusually abundant in Wild 2
as compared to chondrites. A single report of cubanite
(CuFe 2S3) has been interpreted as evidence for aqueous
processing ( Berger et al. 2011), however this mineral can
form in non-aqueous environments.
The iron oxide magnetite (Fe 3O4), including a Cr-rich
variety, has been identiﬁed in a few Wild 2 grains ( Bridges
et al. 2015). Although magnetite in carbonaceous chondrite
meteorites is often ascribed to a secondary origin by aque-
ous alteration ( Kerridge et al. 1979) more detailed obser-
vation of Wild 2 magnetite is necessary in order to reliably
assess its origin.
It is clear that carbonates, sulﬁdes and oxides trace a
diverse range of formation and processing environments
and possibly provide direct evidence for aqueous alteration
within Wild 2, although the rarity of these particular phases
and the lack of any report of phyllosilicates ( Brownlee and
Joswiak 2017) limits the overall extent of aqueous alter-
ation.
2.4.3. Chondritic Anhydrous IDP Mineralogy
Individual IDPs are under 100 m in diameter, and
consist of tens to hundreds of thousands of grains, with
greatly varying mineralogy and composition, i.e., non equi-
librium phase assemblages. The mineralogy of the anhy-
drous chondritic IDPs evidences a wide range of proto-

planetary disk locations and processes. The most abun-
dant crystalline phases are ferromagnesian silicates, mainly
olivine and low-Ca pyroxene with lesser amounts of high-
Ca pyroxene, plagioclase, and Fe-Ni-Zn-sulﬁdes ( Rietmei-
jer1998). The (crystalline) olivine and low-Ca pyroxene
compositions range from almost pure forsterite and enstatite
to relatively high Fe-compositions. While olivine and low-
Ca pyroxene in some IDPs is predominantly Mg-rich, a cen-
sus of anhydrous and hydrous IDPs shows a slight prepon-
derance of Fe-contents 60% ( Zolensky et al. 2008). This
is unlike the ﬂat distribution of Fe-contents for terminal
olivines (’micro-chondrules’) reported for Wild 2 ( Frank
et al. 2014). However additional olivine and pyroxene com-
positional data for IDPs is required to verify these apparent
trends.
Low Fe-, Mn-enriched (LIME) olivines are proposed
to be high-temperature nebular condensates ( Klock et al.
1989). Enstatite ‘whiskers’ in chondritic IDPs, elongated
along the [100] crystallographic axis, are consistent with
rapid growth from a vapor phase ( Bradley 1994c). Most
anhydrous chondritic IDPs also contain nanoscale beads of
glass with embedded metal and sulﬁdes, called “GEMS”
(Bradley 1994b).
The origins of GEMS is debated, with proposed forma-
tion mechanisms including irradiation of crystalline grains
(olivine, pyroxene, etc.), formation in the ISM ( Bradley
2013), or in the protosolar molecular cloud or outer so-
lar nebula (protoplanetary) disk such that GEMS experi-
enced inheritance of ‘solar composition’ ( Keller and Mes-
senger 2011), or the formation by cold processes precursor
to the aggregation of IDPs ( Ishii et al. 2018). In meteorites,
GEMS-like phases have been reported in few meteorites,
for example the Paris CM chondrite ( Leroux et al. 2015),
but this identiﬁcation is disputed ( Villalon et al. 2016). Only
in the Ningqiang C3 chondrite is a radiation damage origin
demonstrated ( Zolensky et al. 2003). GEMS are therefore
believed to be more typical of comets than asteroids. It istherefore very unfortunate that GEMS apparently cannot be
reliably recognized in 81P/Wild 2 samples because of their
similarity to melted silica aerogel ( Ishii et al. 2011).
The unanticipated (to say the least) discovery of numer-
ous CAIs among the recovered 81P/Wild 2 grains has re-
focused attention to refractory IDPs ( Zolensky 1987; Mc-
Keegan 1987), which had been ignored as they were erro-
neously assumed to have purely asteroid origins. These re-
fractory IDPs differ from meteoritic analogues principally
in being much ﬁner grained, although they still await de-
tailed characterization.
Through seeking IDPs for comparison to Stardust ter-
minal olivine grains or ’micro-chondrules’, the Giant IDPs
became a focus of state-of-the-art studies because they were
found to possess a wide range of Mg:Fe- as well as minor
element Mn-, Cr-, and Ca- compositions, potentially sim-
ilar to the Stardust olivines ( Brownlee and Joswiak 2017),
although additional IDP olivine analyses are still required to
demonstrate similarity. As laboratory techniques advanced
and focused on Giant IDPs, the studies of anhydrous chon-
dritic IDPs with only high-Mg content olivines were set
aside. In order to compare the formation conditions of the
olivine and pyroxene in these anhydrous chondritic IDPs,
similar studies to the Giant IDPs, at high spatial resolution
and sensitivity, e.g. of elemental compositions of individual
grains, are necessary.
2.4.4. CP-MMs mineralogy
Chondritic porous micrometeorites (CP-MMs) were ﬁrst
reported by Noguchi et al. (2015). Their mineralogy is sim-
ilar to that of CP-IDPS (here quoted as CA-IDPs), and is
dominated by GEMS, low-Ca pyroxene (including enstatite
whisker/platelet), olivine, and pyrrhotite. These minerals
have angular to subrounded shapes and range from 200 nm
to 1 µm in size. The olivines and pyroxenes are Fe poor,
with compositions ranging from (Mg/Mg+Fe) = 0.7 to 1.
Olivines and low-Ca pyroxenes in CP-MMs have composi-

tional peaks at Mg end members (Forsterite and Enstatite).
CP-MMs contain low-iron manganese-enriched (LIME)
and low-iron chromium-enriched (LICE) ferro-magnesian
silicates. The most Mn-enriched LIME mineral was a low-
Ca pyroxene, with 2.9 wt% MnO, and the most Cr-enriched
LICE mineral was also a low-Ca pyroxene with 1.7 wt%
Cr2O3. Kosmochlor pyroxenes (Ca- and NaCrSi 2O6-rich
are occasionally found in CP-MMs. Roedderite with co-
existing low-Ca pyroxene and amorphous silicate was also
found ( Noguchi et al. 2015, 2017). Noguchi et al. (2022)
reports a unique particle showing both an (anhydrous) CA-
IDP like composition with an hydrated part, suggesting that
a partial hydration of this particle.2.4.5. UCAMM Mineralogy
The mineral components of UCAMMs consist of iso-
lated minerals or small mineral assemblages embedded in
the organic matter ( Dobric ˘a et al. 2012; Charon et al. 2017;
Gu´erin et al. 2020; Yabuta et al. 2017). Both crystalline and
amorphous phases are present. Crystalline minerals consist
of low-Ca Mg-rich pyroxenes (with stoichiometry ranging
between En 60and En 97) and Mg-rich olivines (stoichiom-
etry comprised between Fo 75and Fo 99) with rare Ca-rich
pyroxenes and Fe(Ni) sulﬁdes. Several hypocrystalline-like
(“chondrule-like”) mineral assemblages were identiﬁed in
several UCAMMs. Low Ni-Fe metal and Fe sulﬁdes are
14present in mineral assemblages. In several cases, Fe metal
inclusions show a rim of Fe sulﬁde, suggesting the occur-
rence of an incomplete sulﬁdization process. Pentlandite
is occasionnaly observed. Secondary minerals also include
Mn-, Zn-rich sulﬁde, perryite, as well as small iron oxides,
carbonates and phyllosilicate-like phases ( Dobric ˘a et al.
2012; Gu´erin et al. 2020). Small Na-rich inclusions with
stoichiometry close to Na 2S have been observed in the or-
ganic matter ( Gu´erin et al. 2020). Glassy phases have been
found in several UCAMMs ( Charon et al. 2017; Gu´erin
et al. 2020; Yabuta et al. 2017) that resemble GEMS found
in primitive IDPs ( Keller and Messenger 2011; Bradley
et al. 2014). The GEMS-like phases in UCAMMs however
tend to lack the metal inclusions of GEMS in IDPs, Fe being
mostly in the form of Fe sulﬁdes nano-inclusions. As with
the Wild 2 grains, the close association of high-temperature
crystalline phases with low-temperature carbonaceous mat-
ter in UCAMMs supports the hypothesis of a large-scale
radial mixing in the early solar nebula ( Brownlee et al.
2006).
UCAMMs have an olivine to low-Ca pyroxene ratio of
approximately 0.5, similar to that of chondritic anhydrous
IDPs ( Zolensky and Barrett 1994) and CP-MMs ( Noguchi
et al. 2022). This ratio is compatible with that of P- and
D-type asteroids and comets ( Vernazza et al. 2015). Al-
though amorphous minerals like GEMS are ubiquitous in
CA-IDPs, CP-MMs and UCAMMs, their crystalline min-
eral abundance is higher than the the upper limit of a few
percent of crystallinity observed in the interstellar medium
(Kemper et al. 2004, 2005). Bradley et al. (2014) reports
that GEMS represent up to 70 vol% of CA-IDPs. The value
is not quoted for CP-MMs, but the authors draw a similarity
with CA-IDPs. Dobric ˘a et al. (2012) report that crystalline
materials represent at least 25% of the mineral phases ana-
lyzed in UCAMMs.
It is worth noting that in CA-IDPs, CP-MMs and
UCAMMs, olivines and low-Ca pyroxenes have compo-
sitional peaks at Mg end-members. This is not observed
for Wild 2 samples. Either Wild 2 ferromagnesian sili-
cates are not typical of comets, or CA-IDPs, CP-MMs and
UCAMMs derive from parent bodies different from Wild
2-type comets.
2.5. Cometary dust compositions from astronomical
IR spectroscopy
2.5.1. IR spectroscopy
IR spectroscopic spectral energy distributions (SEDs,
Fversus) of dust thermal emission from cometary co-
mae (3–40m), when ﬁtted with thermal emission mod-
els, provides constraints for the composition of the dust par-
ticles, their structure (porosity or crystal shape) and their
size distribution. The ‘grain size distribution’ (GSD), or
equivalently the dust differential size distribution (DSD),
has parameters of power law slope N, and either smallest
radii limita0or small particle radii apwhere the DSD peaksbefore rolling off at yet smaller particle radii (often called
the Hanner GSD, Hanner (1983)). The particle porosity is
often parameterized by a particle fractal dimension D(see
Table 1). The particle porosity and DSD slope ( DandN)
are co-dependent parameters ( Wooden 2002). With broad
wavelength coverage, the mid-IR (MIR, 5–13m) and
far-IR (FIR, 14–40m) resonances can be sought and
ﬁtted by thermal models to constrain the dust mineralogies.
From IR SEDs, the dust compositions are better de-
termined for the more numerous smallest particles (in the
DSD) and/or hottest particles because smaller particles pro-
duce stronger contrast spectral features (referring to Q ;abs )
and hotter particles produce more relative ﬂux. The more
distinct spectral features arise from submicron to micron-
sized solid particles ( P= 0% ) or from up to20m mod-
erately porous particles ( P= 85% ), which has some im-
plications for comparisons between IR SEDs and cometary
samples. For example, the 20 m and larger Stardust ter-
minal olivine particles would not produce distinct spec-
tral features. Larger extremely porous particles, which
are as hot as their small monomers ( Xing and Hanner
1997), if present in comae even if in smaller mass fractions
can produce resonances ( Kolokolova et al. 2007) and con-
tribute to the SEDs ( Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. 2017a) (sec-
tion 2.5.7). Particles in the DSD larger than 20m are
present in cometary comae because observed FIR SEDs de-
cline more slowly than a single color temperature assessed
for the MIR. As a compliment to this, comae do not solely
possess large extremely porous particles because the pres-
ence of solely porous aggregate particles as warm as their
submicron-sized monomers could not explain cometary IR
SEDs. Thermal model parameters of composition, which is
more sensitive to the properties of the smaller particles, and
DSD parameters ( P,N, anda0orap) are constrained by
ﬁtting the entire IR SED with a DSD that extends to par-
ticle radii out to which the IR SED is sensitive, e.g., mm-
size particles for 7–40m. Above mm-size particles,
longer wavelengths such as by Herschel (Kiss et al. 2015)
andALMA are required, but the mineralogy is constrained
by resonances at MIR–FIR wavelengths discussed here.
Identiﬁcation of dust compositions may be made by
comparison of observed spectral features to laboratory ab-
sorption spectra but quantifying the relative abundances re-
quires computing the thermal emission models to predict
and compare an emission spectrum of an ensemble of par-
ticles to the observed IR SED using standard minimization
techniques (2-minimization). A key aspect of determining
the dust composition, when feasible, is ﬁtting a broad wave-
length SED so that multiple spectral resonances (spectral
features) can be ﬁtted from a material’s vibrational stretch
and vibrational bending modes that span, respectively, MIR
to FIR wavelengths.
2.5.2. Five primary dust compositions
The compositions of cometary dust as determined by
IR spectral analyses has ﬁve primary components that suf-
15ﬁce to allow the IR SED to be well-ﬁtted by thermal mod-
els for most comets: two Mg:Fe amorphous silicates that
produce the broad 10 m and 20m features, two Mg-
rich crystalline silicates that produce multiple narrow spec-
tral peaks in the range of 8–33m, and a highly ab-
sorbing and spectrally featureless and warmer dust compo-
nent that is ubiquitously observed to dominate the dust’s
thermal emission in the NIR ( 3–7.5m). There is a
consensus amongst modelers that this NIR dust emission,
sometimes called the NIR dust ‘continuum’ or ‘pseudo-
continuum)’, is produced by a highly absorbing, carbona-
ceous dust component. This component is well ﬁtted by the
optical properties of amorphous carbon ( Woodward et al.
2021; Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. 2017a; Harker et al. 2022).
Aliphatic carbonaceous dust materials are relatively trans-
parent compared to amorphous carbon, and graphitic car-
bonaceous matter is rare in cometary samples. The potential
connections between cometary dust and amorphous carbon,
versus other species, e.g. organics dominated by aromatic
bonds, by hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HACs), or by
graphite, are discussed in Wooden et al. (2017); Woodward
et al. (2021).
For dielectric materials like silicates, there are spectral
features from which we can deduce the mineralogy in com-
bination with modeled radiative equilibrium temperatures
and modeled spectral emission features. These four primary
siliceous compositions are: Mg:Fe '50:50 amorphous
pyroxene-like (Mg 0:5,Fe0:5)SiO 3and Mg:Fe'50:50
amorphous olivine-like (Mg 0:5,Fe0:5)2SiO4, hereafter re-
ferred to as Mg:Fe amorphous pyroxene and Mg:Fe amor-
phous olivine1; Mg-olivine (forsterite) (Mg x,Fe(1 x))2SiO4
for 1.0x0.8, which produces sharp resonances (spec-
tral ‘peaks’) at or near 11.1–11.2, 19.5, 23.5, 27.5 and
33.5m and weaker peaks at 10.5 and 16.5 m (Crovisier
et al. 1997; Hanner and Zolensky 2010; Wooden et al.
2017; Koike et al. 2003, 2010); Mg-orthopyroxene (en-
statite) (Mg y,Fe(1 y))SiO 3for 1.0y0.9 that produces
resonances at or near 9.3 and 10.0 m and with a set of FIR
resonances near 20 m, which is also where Mg:Fe amor-
phous pyroxene has a broad feature. Depending on the lab-
oratory data and optical constants, the FIR resonances for
Mg-pyroxene may be at these sets of wavelengths: (18.5,
19.2, 20.3m) for ellipsoidal shapes (in our plots) using op-
tical constants from Jaeger et al. (1998), which gives peaks
measured at (18.2, 20.6, 21.6 m); also, laboratory spectra
of ortho-enstatite give peaks at (9.3, 10.7, 19.5, 20.7 m)
from Chihara et al. (2001). Cometary features from Mg-
pyroxene are not yet detected at high spectral contrast in
the FIR. For a spectrum with strong Mg-pyroxene one may
look at FIR Spitzer IRS spectrum of Herbig Ae/Be star
HD179218 (cf. Juh´asz et al. 2010, Fig. 13). Mg-olivine is a
1Mg:Fe'50:50 ratios for each of Mg:Fe amorphous olivine and Mg:Fe
amorphous pyroxene were determined from radiative equilibrium temper-
ature calculations and SED ﬁtting of comet Hale-Bopp ( Harker et al.
2002, 2004), using optical constants from Dorschner et al. (1995), and
so Mg:Fe '50:50 is used by dust modelers (e.g., Ootsubo et al. 2020;
Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. 2017a).well established cometary dust component by either a peak
at 11.1-11.2 m or by a shoulder on the broad ‘10 m’ fea-
ture, which makes the feature look ‘ﬂat-topped’. Also, the
FIR peaks for Mg-olivine are well separated from the cen-
ter of the broad Mg:Fe amorphous olivine ‘20 m’ feature,
whose Mg:Fe composition is established by the radiative
equilibrium temperatures ( Harker et al. 2002, 2004). When
detected, the mass fraction of Mg-olivine present in the
coma is>20%.
Crystalline silicate feature wavelengths and feature
relative intensities depend on composition and crystal
shape. Mg-rich (100% – 90% Mg) crystalline Mg-olivine
(forsterite) is tri-refringent (3 optical axes or 3 sets of in-
dices of refraction) and has spectral peaks that can shift
to somewhat shorter or longer wavelengths depending on
crystal shape ( Koike et al. 2010; Lindsay et al. 2013). The
observed spectral features of forsterite are better ﬁtted by
rectangular prisms slightly elongated or ﬂattened along the
b-axis ( Lindsay et al. 2013) or by ellipsoidal shapes ﬂat-
tened also along the b-axis ( Harker et al. 2002, 2004, 2007);
note that Fabian et al. (2000) shows ellipsoidal shapes and
quotes elongation along the b-axis but actually, as com-
puted, these particles are b-axis ﬂattened when the ( Lb)
parameter used in computing the ellipsoidal particles, as
given as by ( Bohren and Huffman 1983), is larger. The
optical constants used for forsterite (in ﬁgures shown here)
are from Steyer (1974). See Juh´asz et al. (2009) for a com-
parison of other optical constants for Mg-olivine. Optical
constants of Mg-olivine that are derived from measure-
ments of polished single-crystal samples ( Steyer 1974; Suto
et al. 2006) are preferred for modeling crystal shapes ( Lind-
say et al. 2013) rather than optical constants derived from
ground samples that inherently have shape-dependencies
(Fabian et al. 2001; Koike et al. 2010; Imai et al. 2009).
Speciﬁc examples of crystal shape are revealed in the ab-
sorption spectra of forsterite powders that are prepared by
hand-grinding or ball-grinding, where ball-grinding imparts
greater sphericity to the particles ( Koike et al. 2010; Lindsay
et al. 2013; Imai et al. 2009; Tamanai et al. 2006, 2009). A
long standing discrepancy in lab data was resolved when it
was realized that the preparation of the sample as well as the
medium in which the ground mineral sample is embedded
(KBr vs.PE) affects the wavelength positions and relative
depths of absorption bands and the degree of sensitivity
varies for different spectral features as well as with embed-
ding medium ( Tamanai et al. 2009); particles lofted in air
also affect the absorption spectra because particles electro-
statically cling and agglomerate ( Tamanai et al. 2006).
With increasing Fe-content, olivine peaks shift to longer
wavelengths ( Koike et al. 2003). The observed range of
wavelengths for the cometary 11.1-11.2 m feature restricts
Mg-contents from 100–80% for Mg-olivine (see Fig. 12).
Silicates, being dielectrics, emit strongly through their
MIR vibrational stretching and FIR vibrational bending
modes and possess little absorptivity at wavelengths shorter
than7.5m so, we repeat, the thermal emission at shorter
wavelengths is likely from a carbonaceous dust component.
16Iron sulﬁde (FeS) mineral is dark but not as absorbing as
amorphous carbon. FeS has yet to be modeled as a major
dust component contributing in the NIR for reasons that in-
clude: the optical constants are lacking for the full range of
wavelengths and/or are contested and are speciﬁcally lack-
ing at 3–10m, FeS is not yet ﬁrmly detected spectroscop-
ically (section 2.5.4), and FeS does not yield the correct
scattered light color even if held to 6% volume of the parti-
cle (Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. 2017a) (see section 2.5.7).
Each of the ﬁve dust compositions that dominate SEDs
have analogous materials in cometary samples and in an-
hydrous chondritic IDPs (CA-IDPs). Spectral features are
measured in bulk and thin sections of CA-IDPs ( Bradley
et al. 1992; Wooden et al. 2000; Matrajt et al. 2005), in CP-
MMs ( Noguchi et al. 2015) and in UCAMMs ( Dartois et al.
2018). The amorphous silicates are thought to be akin to the
GEMS ( Bradley et al. 1992; Bradley et al. 1999; Bradley
2013; Noguchi et al. 2015; Dobric ˘a et al. 2012). The Mg-
olivine and Mg-pyroxene are spectrally akin to forsterite
Fo100–Fo80and ortho-enstatite En 100–En90. The amor-
phous carbon is akin to some phases of disordered carbon
and the occasionally quoted amorphous carbon in CA-IDPs
(Mu˜noz Caro et al. 2006; Wirick et al. 2009; Woodward
et al. 2021). A fraction of the smallest particles observed
in the in situ measurements of 1P/Halley were composed
solely of carbon ( Lawler and Brownlee 1992; Fomenkova
et al. 1994). Alternatively, we note that possibly aromatic-
bonded carbon ( -bonds or C =C bonds) could produce a
signiﬁcant absorptivity because of its higher UV-VIS cross
sections. Organic matter in CA-IDPs and CP-MMs is gen-
erally similar to IOM from primitive meteorites, however
with intrinsic characteristics like a higher aliphatic/aromatic
ratio in CA-IDPs compared to meteoritic IOM ( Flynn et al.
2003; Keller et al. 2004; Matrajt et al. 2005; Mu˜noz Caro
et al. 2006; Wirick et al. 2009; Matrajt et al. 2012; Noguchi
et al. 2015). Organic matter in UCAMMs is dominated
by polyaromatic matter like in IOM, however it can show
higher abundances of N than in meteoritic IOM ( Dartois
et al. 2018) (see section 2.2).
Figure 10 shows comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp), which
is the best example of an IR SED of a coma with a
plethora of submicron silicate crystals and a higher silicate-
to-amorphous carbon ratio (high contrast silicate features
relative to the ‘featureless’ emission from a distribution
of porous amorphous carbon particles and distribution of
larger porous amorphous silicates). Clear and distinctive
spectral peaks from (crystalline) Mg-olivine and (crys-
talline) Mg-pyroxene provide a benchmark for modeling
crystalline silicates (shapes and temperatures). Speciﬁcally,
the ‘hot crystal’ model ( Harker et al. 2002, 2004, 2007;
Woodward et al. 2021; Harker et al. 2022) increases the
radiative equilibrium temperature of the Mg-olivine by a
factor of 1.7 over that predicted using the optical constants
in order to ﬁt the Hale-Bopp spectra at 2.75 au. Hale-
Bopp’s Mg-pyroxene is spectrally discernible by its sharp
peaks more so at epochs near perihelion than at rh=2.75au,
which is attributed to its transparency compared to the other

et al. 1999; Harker et al. 2002, 2004). Mg-olivine (crys-
talline) has peaks at 10.0, 11.1-11.2, 16.5, 19.5, 23.5, 27.5,
and 33.5m. Mg-pyroxene (crystalline) has a triple of
peaks at 9.3, 10.5, and 11.0-11.3 m and have modeled

17dust compositions ( Wooden et al. 1999). The same jets are
active at the two epochs at rh= 1.2auand 0.93au(Hay-
ward et al. 2000), and the thermal models ﬁtted to their
IR SEDs reveal minor differences in their mineralogy such
that Mg-pyroxene has a greater relative abundance com-
pared to Mg-olivine at 1.2 authan at 0.93 au: if the relative
strength of the Mg-pyroxene and Mg-olivine features only
are attributed to a temperature increase at smaller helio-
centric distances then Mg-pyroxene would be expected to
be enhanced relative to the Mg-olivine peaks at 0.93 au
but instead by visual comparison the Mg-pyroxene peaks
are enhanced at 1.2 aucompared to 0.93 au. Also, shown
in Fig. 10 is the distinct contribution of the Mg-pyroxene
9.3m peak to the short wavelength shoulders of the broad
10m feature from Mg:Fe amorphous pyroxene and Mg:Fe
amorphous olivine.
2.5.3. Degeneracies in compositions derived from thermal
models
Possible degeneracies in dust compositions that can be
overcome by ﬁtting multiple spectral peaks include: (a) the
11.1-11.2m feature of Mg-olivine and the 11.2 m PAH
emission band; (b) wavelength shifts due to crystal shape
(Koike et al. 2010; Lindsay et al. 2013) or increasing Fe-
contents ( Koike et al. 2003) because the 23.5 m FIR fea-
ture of Mg-olivine is more sensitive to shape (olivine with
greater than 40% Fe causes the entire FIR spectrum to
change morphology ( Koike et al. 2003)); (c) at rh>3–
3.5au, the MIR short wavelength shoulder can be ﬁt-
ted with Mg:Fe amorphous pyroxene or by the warm fea-
tureless emission from amorphous carbon but ﬁtting the
FIR pyroxene band removes this degeneracy; (d) the Mg-
pyroxene 9.3 m peak and the short wavelength shoulder of
the Mg:Fe amorphous pyroxene feature occur at 9.3 m but
sufﬁcent SNR to detect the Mg-pyroxene 10.5 m peak as
well as measuring the far-IR resonances can distinguish be-
tween these two compositions. If we contrast Mg-pyroxene
with Mg-olivine, Mg-olivine may be assessed even when
the 11.1-11.2 m peak is not clearly discernible against the
broad Mg:Fe amorphous olivine or Mg:Fe amorphous py-
roxene features because Mg-olivine’s primary peak in the
MIR occurs at the longer wavelength side of the broad
‘10m silicate feature’ so that if a broad silicate feature
appears to not be declining at 11-12.5 m but instead ap-
pears ‘ﬂat-topped’ then Mg-olivine is the candidate.
The FIR the peaks from Mg-olivine are at distinctly dif-
ferent wavelengths than the FIR Mg:Fe amorphous olivine
feature, thereby allowing for FIR Mg-olivine peaks to not
compete with FIR Mg:Fe amorphous olivine in the 2-
minimization between the model and the data, and the effect
is that Mg-olivine FIR peaks are spectrally discernible even
when the FIR peaks are weak.
In contrast, the FIR sharp peaks from Mg-pyroxene
and the FIR broad feature of Mg:Fe amorphous pyroxene
are at nearly the same wavelengths. Moreover, there are
some variations in the predicted wavelengths for the Mg-

atrh= 1.74au(2005-10-14.63 UT), and two epochs
of 46P/Wirtanen showing IR SEDs with decreasing con-
strast silicate features and decreasing ratios of silicate-to-
amorphous carbon in their ﬁtted thermal models ( Harker
et al. 2022). Amorphous silicates and no crystalline sil-
icates are constrained in the thermal model ﬁt to 46P at
rh=1.49au(2008-04-24.64 UT). For comet 46P/Wirtanen
atrh= 1.74au(2008-05-24.06 UT), weak features from
Mg-pyroxene (crystalline) are evident at 9.3, 10.5 m but
more difﬁcult to discern in the far-IR and where the Mg-
pyroxene resonances overlap in spectral wavelength with
the far-IR broad Mg:Fe amorphous pyroxene feature.

tures of (crystalline) Mg-olivine (co, in green ) and (crys-

(as ﬁtted in Fig. 11), and (c) 46P at rh=1.7au((2008-05-
24.06 UT) and ﬁtted only over the MIR 5–13 m, which
shows an increase in Mg-pyroxene relative abundance com-
pared to the model in (b). (d) Wavelength dependencies

laboratory work by Chihara et al. (2002); Koike et al.
(2003); thickness of lines relates to strengths of observed
peaks. Also are shown are Mg:Fe amorphous olivine ( royal
blue) and Mg:Fe amorphous pyroxene ( cyan ). The ob-
served and modeled crystalline feature wavelengths align
with Mg=1.0–0.8.
pyroxene FIR peaks partly because of there are variations
in the optical constants, the peaks depend on shapes ofthe crystals, and laboratory measurements of feature wave-
lengths depend on the embedding medium ( Tamanai et al.
2009). We have yet to observe a cometary IR SED that
has strong Mg-pyroxene peaks in the FIR to conﬁrm the
choice of optical constants and crystal shapes in the mod-
els. We show for comet 46P/Wirtanen at rh= 1.74au, the
coincidence of features of Mg-pyroxene and Mg:Fe amor-
phous pyroxene in the FIR (see Fig. 12(b,c); Bottom Panel
Fig. 11). In observed cometary IR SEDs, Mg-pyroxene
peaks appear more discernible at MIR wavelengths than in
the FIR, and this may contribute to Mg-pyroxene having
lower relative abundance relative to the other dust compo-
nents when the MIR and FIR are ﬁtted compared to when
only the MIR is ﬁtted. As a demonstration, compare model
ﬁtted to full SED of 46P at 1.7 au(Fig.12 b) with model
ﬁtted only to MIR (Fig.12 c). This aspect of the thermal
models seems contrary to the aim of ﬁtting multiple reso-
nances over the fullest wavelength range and why spectral
features of Mg-pyroxene in the FIR are of lower contrast
than predicted by thermal models, given the resonances in
the MIR, is a puzzle and may depend on their optical prop-
erties (see section 2.5.2). When weak Mg-pyroxene fea-
tures are modeled then there is a signiﬁcant relative mass
fraction (>30%) of this dust component because its lower
absorptivity ( Qabs) (Harker et al. 2022) yeilds cooler tem-
peratures and hence lower ﬂuxes relative to warmer dust
components (i.e., a greater relative mass is required to ﬁt the
observed features when the particles are cooler) ( Wooden
et al. 1999). Mg-pyroxene FIR peaks may or may not be
ﬁtted by2-minimization of models to the data when the
stronger broad feature from Mg:Fe amorphous pyroxene
broad feature dominates the ﬂux. These factors need to
be considered when contrasting the relatively low number
of cometary IR SEDs ﬁtted with Mg-pyroxene compared
to the frequent identiﬁcation of Mg-pyroxene in cometary
samples.
Comet 46P at rh=1.47auhas a weak silicate feature
(Fig. 11 (b)). The ﬁtted thermal model has a DSD that
peaks atap=0.6m so submicron particles are present in
the coma, which can produce distinct features when com-
posed of silicates. The weak silicate feature thus is modeled
by a high relative mass fraction of amorphous carbon com-
pared to the amorphous silicates whose resonances also are
ﬁtted. This epoch of comet 46P is similar to comet C/2017
US10(Catalina) that has a high wt% amorphous carbon.
The elemental C/Si ratio for comet C/2017 US 10(Catalina)
is similar to comet 67P/C-G, which has organic IOM-like
matter, and both of which have C/Si ratios close to the ISM
value ( Woodward et al. 2021).
2.5.4. Dust compositions not yet ﬁrmly detected in IR
SEDs
As stated above, the ﬁve dominant compositions as-
sessed from IR SEDs have analog dust species in cometary
IDPs, in Stardust samples, and in in situ compsitional stud-
ies of 1P/Halley and 67P/C-G particles but the contrary is
19not true: there are dust compositions in cometary samples
that are not detected in IR SEDs that include inorganics and
organics.
As the Fe-content of olivine increases from 20% to 40%,
the MIR peak shifts from 11.2 – 11.4 m (Koike et al. 2010)
but this wavelength also depends on crystal shape ( Lindsay
et al. 2013). Detections of peaks in the 16–27 m FIR re-
gion are required to discern Mg:Fe 60:40 from the peaks
we observe and model in comets that span Mg:Fe propor-
tions from 100:0 to 80:20 (see Fig. 12 and Koike et al.
(2003)). Due to the enhanced Q abs;UVIS of Fe-olivine,
thermal models also will need to demonstrate increased ra-
ditative equilibrium temperatures of Fe-olivine in contrast
to Mg-olivine.
Fe sulﬁdes are present and abundant in many cometary
samples and UCAMMs. FeS may be identiﬁed through a
very broad 23 m feature, which is much broader compared
to Mg-olivine 23.5 m feature, and only is expected for
submicron FeS grains ( Keller et al. 2000). However, differ-
ent measurements produce different predictions for Q abs;IR
that range from strong FIR resonances ( Begemann et al.
1994; Henning and Mutschke 1997) to no FIR resonances
(Hofmeister and Speck 2003). A single reference suggests
a 3.63m feature in the NIR ( Tamanai et al. 2003), and
dirth of FeS data in the NIR is represented by a dashed line
in the Pollack et al. (1994)’s protoplanetary disk opacities.
If FeS has a spectral feature near 3 m then FeS could not
provide the opacity needed to explain the ubiquitous fea-
tureless thermal emission (NIR ‘pseudo-continuum’) from
warm particles, which currently is ascribed to a highly ab-
sorbing cabonaceous component and well-ﬁtted by amor-
phous carbon.
The MIR spectral features of phyllosilicates overlap with
the 10m features of anhydrous amorphous silicates, e.g.
Mg:Fe amorphous olivine and Mg:Fe amorphous pyroxene,
but the 20m features from phyllosilicates are signiﬁcantly
different ( Wooden et al. 1999). Phyllosilicates including
montmorillonite ( Wooden et al. 1999), smectite and ser-
pentine are abundant in hydrated chondritic IDPs ( Bradley
et al. 1989). At most 5% montmorillonite may be present in
the coma of C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) ( Wooden et al. 1999).
The spectral features of phyllosilicates (smectite nontron-
ite) are claimed for 9P/Tempel 1 at +45 minpost- Deep Im-
pact (Lisse et al. 2007), as well as for comet C/1995 O1
(Hale-Bopp) but other well-ﬁtted thermal models are with-
out phyllosilicates ( Harker et al. 2002, 2004; Harker and
Desch 2002; Min2005) (Fig. 10).
The low density amorphous silicates in cometary IDPs,
the Glass with Embedded Metal and Sulﬁdes (GEMS)
(Bradley et al. 2022), have limited spectral data ( Bradley
et al. 1999; Ishii et al. 2018) and are presumed to be spec-
trally analogous to Mg:Fe amorphous silicates in thermal
models, which were derived from rapid-cooling of melts
(Dorschner et al. 1995). Amorphous silicates are discussed
in the context of IR spectra of cometary IDPs (e.g. Brunetto
et al. 2011). Experiments have created amorphous silicates,
e.g. via particle bombardment of crystals or via the solgelmethod ( J¨ager et al. 2003; Brucato et al. 2004; Demyk et al.
2004; Wooden et al. 2005, 2007; J¨ager et al. 2016) but how
the structure of the experimental amorphous silicates or the
“amorphization rate” affects the IR signature of the analogs
used in thermal models has not been assessed.
Mg-carbonates are relatively rare in cometary samples
(section §2.4) and are not deﬁnitively detected in cometary
IR SEDs. Carbonates (siderite and magnesite) are discussed
for comet 9P/Tempel 1 ( Lisse et al. 2007) but the simultane-
ous occurrence of water vapor emission lines in the overlap-
ping wavelength region, when modeled, yields a marginal
detection of the 7.00 m carbonate feature and an abun-
dance that is 2 to 3 times lower ( Crovisier and Bockel ´ee-
Morvan 2008). Water vapor lines must be modeled con-
currently with the dust thermal emission, and the 5–8 m
spectral region calls for higher SNR studies such as will be
available from JWST .
Aromatic macromolecules or PAHs are efﬁcient emit-
ters of IR photons and their spectra can be predicted ( As-
trochem.org 2022). Unlike the free-ﬂying PAH macro-
molecules, we are asking: what are the excitation mecha-
nisms that could produce emission features from aromatic-
bonded carbon within organic-rich particles? Can photo-
processing of PAHs, which can alter their size distribution,
occur within organic-rich particles ( Clemett et al. 2010)?
Currently, we rely on computing emission spectra of parti-
cles using optical constants that have been determined for
a limited number of organic residues (tholin-like materi-
als). Measurements of absorption spectra are more numer-
ous than the suite of available optical constants ( n,k) from
which we can compute Q abs;UVIS and Qabs;IR for ther-
mal emission models. UCAMMs offer a template for the
potential wavelength positions of IR spectral features be-
cause UCAMMs have so much organic material, including
polyaromatic bonds, that their absorption spectra can be ob-
tained without acid dissolution of the silicates (e.g. Dartois
et al. 2018), which is done for meteoritic IOM ( Alexander
et al. 2017) and that is known to alter some of the organic
fraction in IDPs (e.g., see Matrajt et al. 2005). However,
UCAMMs contain a N-rich organic phase that is too N-rich
to be akin to meteoritic IOM and 67P/C-G, so UCAMMs
can not serve to predict the presence of organic features in
comets such as 67P/C-G.
The PAH spectral features sought are their skeletal vi-
bration bands in the 5–8 m wavelength region and by their
peripherial C-H bonds near 3.28 m and at longer wave-
lengths where the skeletal structure affects the feature lo-
cations. PAHs are discussed for comet 9P/Tempel 1 ( Lisse
et al. 2007). However, thermal models of the same IR SED
that simultaneously model the water vapor emission lines
and the PAHs in the 5.25–8.5 m wavelength region pro-
duce lower abundances of PAHs by at least 2–3 times ( Cro-
visier and Bockel ´ee-Morvan 2008).
Distinct resonances from PAH-like organics contribute
to features at8.5m and11.2m and possibly aliphatic
hydrocarbons at9.2m (Fig. 13) in the inner coma of
comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner at rh=1.04au(Ootsubo et al.

troscopy of the inner coma reveals emission bands at-
tributed to PAHs (8.23, 9.23, 11.17 m) that contribute
in excess to the thermal model of amorphous carbon,
Mg:Fe amorphous olivine, Mg:Fe amorphous pyroxene,
Mg-olivine (Crys. Oliv.) and Mg-pyroxene (Crys. Pyrox.)

14m because of possible calibration issues associated
with the data taking sequence ( Harker et al. 2022; Kelley
et al. 2021). Compared to 2.3 au, PAH bands are present
in the coma of 21P at rh=1auas well as hotter particles,
which can be seen by the spectral slope change between
1.0auand 2.3au.2020) as well as Mg-rich amorphous silicates and Mg-
silicates. However, the organic bands are not detected in
the coma of 21P post-perihelion by lower spatial resolu-
tion Spitzer +IRS at the larger heliocentric distance of rh=
2.292au(Harker et al. 2022) (Fig. 13).
Organics with aliphatic bonds may produce a 3.4 m
emission feature such as seen in CA-IDPs ( Matrajt et al.
2005) and in some Stardust particles ( Matrajt et al. 2008)
and are suggested for comet 103P/Hartley 2 ( Feaga et al.
2021; Wooden et al. 2011) as well as other comets by
Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. (1995) who noted a strong correla-
tion with CH 3OH production rates. Lines of sight through
the diffuse ISM, e.g, towards the Galactic Center, reveal the
3.4m feature. By comparison of the two primary compo-
nents of this feature from  CH3(2960cm 1, 3.38m)
and CH2(2930cm 1, 3.41m), the diffuse ISM has
shorter chains and is more processed than in cometary mat-
ter (Matrajt et al. 2013).
This solid state emission feature from organics is in the
same spectral region as gaseous emission lines from ethane
C2H6and methanol CH 3OH that are observed at high spec-
tral resolution and for which modeling is a challenge ( Bonev
et al. 2021, Fig. 5) so a method that combines observing or
modeling the emission lines of the gaseous species ( Feaga
et al. 2021, as mentioned in ) with modeling the solid state
material that typically has multiple resonances from  CH2
and CH3bonds is required to further assess the pres-
ence of this aliphatic carbon component. Absorption fea-
tures from aliphatic bonds are common in CA-IDPs (§2.2).
The difference between laboratory studies of IDP absorp-
tion spectra and cometary IR spectra is that the 3.4 m
features arising from dust in comae are expected to be in
emission. Predicting the emission spectra is at the forefront
of thermal modeling developments and we note that optical
constants are lacking for carbonaceous materials dominated
by aliphatic bonds as opposed to rich in aromatic bonds.
To date, most organics that have measured optical con-
stants are dominated by aromatic bonds (the 3.28 m PAH
feature and features in the 5–9 m region) and for modeling
comets we need organic residues that are rich in aliphatic
bonds, if we use CA-IDPs as our guide. The temperatures
of the organic-bearing particles that produce the 3.4 m
emission feature and its relative abundance will determine
the strength or contrast of the feature relative to the strong
NIR ‘continuum’ emission from highly absorbing carbona-
ceous matter that is modeled by optical constants of amor-
phous carbon.
2.5.5. Discrete materials or mixed material aggregates?
There are compelling reasons to treat cometary particles
as aggregates of mixed materials. CA-IDPs show that parti-
cles are mixtures, i.e., unequilibrated aggregates of amor-
phous silicates (GEMS), crystalline silicates, organics of
varying compositions (§ 2.2), and iron sulﬁdes. Some
CA-IDPs are dominated by carbonaceous matter ( Thomas
et al. 1993) while others like the Giant IDPs are inti-
21mate mixtures of mini-chondrules of Fe-olivine with minor
Mg-olivine, as well as sulﬁdes and GEMS ( Brownlee and
Joswiak 2017). Alternatively, there are some observations
that strongly motivate our thinking that the carbonaceous
materials and the siliceous materials may be discrete com-
ponents in cometary comae or at least they vary in their rela-
tive abundance ratios depending on what part of the nucleus
is active. Some examples are: (a) comet C/2001 Q4 (NEAT)
revealed a signiﬁcant drop in the silicate feature contrast
in about a hour, which is the jet crossing time for the ob-
serving aperture ( Wooden et al. 2004), (b) comet C/2017
US10(Catalina) had an increase in the amorphous carbon-
to-silicate ratio between two epochs separated by about 6
weeks of time, where the observing epoch refers the UT
date and time and ephemerides of the comet ( Woodward
et al. 2021), (c & d) the inner coma studies of 9P/Tempel 1
post- Deep Impact byGemini +Michelle spectroscopy show
rapidly changing compositions ( Harker et al. 2007) and by
Subaru +COMICS narrow band imaging show Mg-olivine,
then amorphous carbon, and then Mg-olivine in the few
hours following the Deep Impact event, (e) the outburst
of comet 17P/Holmes showed crystalline-rich material that
then changed composition well after outburst ( Reach et al.
2010), and (f) multi-epoch Spitzer +IRS spectra of a hand-
ful of comets show variable compositions for multi-epochs
(Harker et al. 2022) (see also Fig. 11). Complimenting re-
mote sensing results, the in situ measurements of cometary
particles indicate from 1P/Halley revealed that particles
were siliceous-only, carbonaceous-only, and mixed parti-
cles ( Schulze et al. 1997; Fomenkova et al. 1992; Lawler
and Brownlee 1992) and that carbonaceous-only particles
dominated within 9000 km of the nucleus ( Fomenkova and
Chang 1994).
When computing mixed material aggregates for thermal
models to be ﬁtted to cometary IR SEDs, there are a lot
of combinations of materials that have to be computed in
order to provide the potential suite of relative abundances
of discrete materials that will need to be used to ﬁt the IR
SEDs. Employing silicate crystals with edges is particu-
larly pertinent to ﬁtting cometary spectra ( Lindsay et al.
2013) because notably spheres do not ﬁt the observed spec-
tral features and ellipsoids are adequate ( Harker et al. 2002,
2004; Min2005; Moreno et al. 2003). The work to compute
a suite of potential materials in mixed material aggregates
has begun ( Wooden et al. 2021) but is as yet insufﬁcient in
breath to constrain relative abundances of materials for a
sample of cometary IR SEDs. A particle size distribution
of an ensemble of discrete materials is currently the state of
the art for thermal models.
2.5.6. Thermal emission models, Dust equations
Computing the scattered light component and the ther-
mal emission component (typically starting at 3 m for
rh<2.5au) of the ﬂux observed from a cometary coma re-
quires a set of equations (Table 1) and a set of suppositions:
suppose a single DSD, a chosen porosity Pand an ensembleof compositions represent the dust in the coma and then the
models are assessed against the observations using standard
minimization ( 2-minimization) techniques.
The emergent ﬂux is a sum over the particle size distri-
bution of the thermally emitted ﬂuxes per particle of vary-
ing compositions and/or particle structures. Per particle,
the thermal ﬂux is set by the particles’ dust temperature
(Td) that results from radiative equilibrium between ab-
sorbed sunlight and emitted thermal radiation. Both the
dust temperature and dust ﬂux depend upon the product of
the particle’s absorptivity (Q abs;IR ) and its cross sectional
areaG(a). The particle’s wavelength-dependent absorptiv-
ity (Q;abs ) depends on composition, radius ( a), shape and
porosity.
The optical properties are called the absorptivity Q abs;IR
and scattering efﬁciency Q ;sca , which are computed from
the real and imaginary optical constants, nandk, using var-
ious methods. Porous aggregates of mixed compositions,
such as amorphous silicates, amorphous carbon and FeS,
can be well modeled by ‘mixing’ optical constants and vac-
uum such as when Mie Theory is combined with Effec-
tive Medium Theory (EMT) or Brugemann Mixing The-
ory (BM); or by layering such as in Distribution of Hol-
low Spheres (DHS) ( Min 2005); or Rayleigh-Gans-Debye
(Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. 2017a,b). However, Mg-olivine
cannot be well modeled by mixing optical constants with
vacuum; the predicted spectral features do not come close
to observed spectra or laboratory spectra. This presents the
challenge of computing the optical properties of mixed ma-
terial porous aggregates with crystal monomers with edges
and faces, and some progress has been made using the
Discrete Dipole Approximation with the DDSCAT code
(Moreno et al. 2003; Wooden et al. 2021). Scattering ef-
ﬁciencies (Q ;sca ) have been computed using DDSCAT or
T-Matrix because aggregates scatter differently than spheres
(Kimura et al. 2016; Kolokolova et al. 2023).
More absorbing particles are warmer and smaller par-
ticles are warmer, and the co-dependencies between these
dust properties is mitigated by the assessment of the relative
ﬂuxes and wavelengths of spectral resonances or spectral
‘features’. Spectral features only arise from particles com-
posed of dielectric materials that are smaller than about 1–
3m-radii for solid (0% porosity, fractal dimension D= 3)
particles and for <10–20m-diameter moderately porous
particles (65–85% porosity, D2:86  2:7,Harker
et al. (2002, 2004)). For particles of the same composi-
tion, the dust temperature depends more weakly on effec-
tive radius than on heliocentric distance from the Sun ( rh).
When of the same composition, smaller particles are hotter
simply because quantum mechanically smaller particles are
less efﬁcient emitters of photons at wavelengths larger than
their cross sections ( G(a)); historically, this effect has been
called Superheat (Gehrz and Ney 1992). Cometary SEDs
do not reveal a single color temperature (Planck function ﬁt-
ted to wavelengths outside resonant features); the color tem-
perature is warmer at shorter NIR wavelengths and cooler
at FIR wavelengths. For a color temperature Tcolor(rh)ﬁt-
22ted to7.5m and13m, a longstanding relationship
versus heliocentric distance ( rh) is given in the Table 1.
For particles of the same effective radius and rh, there
is strong dependence of dust temperature on the dust com-
position through signiﬁcant variations in the absorptivity
Qabs;UVIS at wavelengths where sunlight is absorbed. To
achieve the highest temperatures observed for comae parti-
cles (e.g., § 2.5.7), small and highly absorbing particles are
required or large extremely porous aggregates that are com-
posed of mainly highly absorbing materials and whose large
particle temperatures are equivalent to the temperatures of
their submicron monomers.
Crystalline materials in the DSD are often are limited to
radii of less than 1 m to a few micron because predicted
resonances of larger crystals do not ﬁt observed spectral
features (e.g., see Lindsay et al. 2013). Relative mass frac-
tions are quoted for the up-to 1 m portion of the DSD.
The emission spectra of silicate particles or of amorphous
carbon particles of increasing larger radii than these 3 m
and 20m radii, respectively for solid and for moderately
porous particles, have increasingly broader as well as sig-
niﬁcantly weaker contrast resonances (with respect to wave-
lengths outside of their resonances). Thermal model param-
eters are co-dependent but are not degenerate when dielec-
tric materials like silicates are present in comae because,
in practice, varying the composition, DSD, and particle
porosities produces thermal models that are distinguishable
when ﬁtted against the observed SEDs with good signal-to-
noise ratios using minimization metrics ( 2-minimization).
There are three albedos of interest for assessing comae
particle properties: the particle albedo ( A), the geometric
albedo, and the bolometric albedo.
The geometric albedo is, by deﬁnition, assessed at zero
degrees phase angle ( = 0in the observer’s frame) ( Han-
ner et al. 1981; Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. 2017a) (= 0
translates to = 180or opposition, where is the an-
gle between incident sunlight and scattered ray in the par-
ticle’s frame). The geometric albedo at non-zero phase
angles may be extrapolated from comae observations of
Ap() =Ap(= 0)j()using the “phase curve”
j()andAp()can be compared to Ap()computed for
spheres (Mie) and for porous aggregate particles of varying
composition and porosity ( Hanner et al. 1981; Kimura et al.
2016; Kimura et al. 2006, 2003).
Alternatively, to calculate at the observed phase angle
(Ap()), one can use the thermal model ﬁtting parameters
that include the product G(a)Q;abs to derive the dust ef-
fective area by assuming Qabs= 1:
dust eective area = KZamax
aminG(a) n(a) da
Then the geometric albedo is the scattered light ﬂux den-
sity divided by the dust effective area G(a)(Hanner et al.
1981; Tokunaga et al. 1986) at the observer’s phase angle .
G(a)can be calculated from either the Wein side of the
thermal emission in the NIR or by thermal models ﬁtted
to a broader wavelength IR SED. This technique of calcu-lating the geometric albedo, which was popular when the
dust emission was studied with narrow band ﬁlter photom-
etry, avoids having to measure or assume knowledge of the
dusty coma phase curve j().
Finally, the bolometric albedo ( Gehrz and Ney 1992) en-
ables an empirical assessment of the particle properties in
the comae of many comets at different phase angles ( Wood-
ward et al. 2015, 2021). The bolometric albedo A()bolo
is an approximate measure of the scattered to total inci-
dent energy (sunlight) ( Woodward et al. 2015), where the
total incident energy is assessed by the sum of the thermal
(re-emitted) and scattered energies ( F), each measured
at the wavelengths of their maximum energy output (Ta-
ble 1). The opportunity to tie the scattered light to the ther-
mal emission potentially offers additional insights into dust
properties and compositions for two reasons: the scattered
light may be contributed to by higher albedo (and poten-
tially cooler) dust components such as ice grains or organ-
ics, and particle structure affects scattering and thermal in
distinct ways ( Tokunaga et al. 1986) (§ 2.5.7, 2.5.8).
2.5.7. Dust composition and DSD from combined scat-
tered & NIR thermal: 67P/C-G outbursts
The Rosetta +VIRTIS-H spectra of the quiescent coma
and of two short duration outbursts (2015-09-13T13.645
and 2015-09-14T18.828 UT) from comet 67P/C-G as mod-
eled and presented by Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. (2017a,b)
provide an excellent demonstration of how models ﬁtted
to dust scattering together with dust thermal emission can
predictS0
color,Td;color andA()bolo, and thereby provide
constraints on dust compositions and DSD parameters.
The scattered light color ( S0) (whether the color is ’blue’,
‘neutral’ or ‘red’ relative to reﬂected sunlight) provides
information about the composition of the dust particles
(Storrs et al. 1992; Zubko et al. 2015; Hyland et al. 2019;
Kulyk et al. 2021; Li et al. 2014). The dust color tem-
perature, derived in this case from ﬁtting a scaled Planck
function to the 2–5 m dust continuum measurements,
represents either the DSD-weighted temperatures of the
warmest particles, i.e., the smallest and/or most highly ab-
sorbing ones, or the DSD-weighted temperatures of aggre-
gate mixed particles, or a combination thereof. The bolo-
metric albedo is an approximate measure of the scattered
to total incident energy (sunlight) ( Woodward et al. 2015)
and is assessed at the observers phase angle = 180–=
108, 99for the two dates. The geometric albedo Ap()
requires the dust effective area be calculated from dust ther-
mal models ﬁtted to the IR ( Hanner et al. 1981, 1985; Toku-
naga et al. 1986). When the spectra provide the three met-
rics of dust scattered light color slope S0, NIR color tem-
peratureTd;color from the thermal emission, and either the
bolometric albedo A()boloor the geometric albedo Ap,
then these four dust model parameters can be constrained,
via2-minimization against the metrics derived from the
spectra: two DSD parameters (smallest particle radius a0
and DSD slope N), the particle porosity Pthat is parame-

frac is the volume fraction of in-
clusions of lesser opaque material within a matrix of more
highly opaque material.
First, we summarize the properties of the quiescent
coma of 67P/C-G on the two dates prior to the coma
outbursts (Fig. 1 in Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. (2017a)).
The quiescent coma presents a NIR ‘red’ color slope
ofS0
color=2.60:3%/100nm, 2.30:4%/100nm for
ref;=2.0m, 2.5m on the two respective dates.
Compared to the NIR color slope, the visible wave-
length scattered light spectra have a steeper color slope
15–183%/100nm withref;=0.45–0.8m (Rinaldi
et al. 2017), which is typical of cometary comae. The
quiescent coma has an estimated bolometric albedo of
A()bolo= 0:130:2, and a dust color temperature of
Td;color300K.
A set of models that ﬁt the data include porous spheres
of 2-compositions of Mg:Fe amorphous olivine in a matrix
of amorphous carbon ( qfrac=0.7) and with porosity lim-
ited to beP0:5(Mannel et al. 2016, MIDAS ‘com-
pact particles’) and DSD slope of N3. The compo-
sition (qfrac=0.7) translates to 66 vol% amorphous car-
bon and 34 vol% amorphous olivine, with ranges of cou-
pled model parameters that include ( a0,N,qfrac,D,P) =
(0.3m, 2.5, 0.7, 2.5,0.5) and = (0.9 m, 3.0, 0.7, 2.5,
0.5). The model limits P0:5, so this limits particles
bigger than 0.4 m to have the porosity that is independent
of radiiaand this porosity is lower that the porosity equa-
tion (Table 1); if Dwas applied over the full DSD then for
D= 2:5the porosity values would be, e.g., P(0.4m)=0.5,
P(1m)=0.68,P(3m)=0.82.
Alternatively, for a similar porosity prescription and
DSD parameters, the data also can be ﬁtted using com-
positions of pure carbon, carbon and a lower qfrac of
more transparent Mg-rich amorphous pyroxene or Mg-
olivine (forsterite). However, for pure silicate grains or sil-
icates mixed with 6 vol% FeS (consistent with Fulle et al.
(2016c)), DSD parameters sufﬁcient to produce the mea-
suredTd;color yield NIR neutral colors (as opposed to the
observed NIR red colors) and bolometric albedos higher
than measured.
Lastly, the quiescent coma also is modeled successfully
with 25% by number of extremely porous aggregate parti-
cles (D=1.7), which provide less than 1.5 per cent of the
particle albedo at 2 m as well as provide thermal emission
(Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. 2017a). Extremely porous aggre-
gate particles, often called Ballistic Cluster Cluster Aggre-
gates (BCCA), have particle temperatures and spectral res-
onances similar to their (small and hotter) monomers, i.e.,
independent of their particle size ( Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al.
2017a; Tazaki et al. 2016; Kimura et al. 2016; Kolokolova
et al. 2007), and the relative contributions of BCCA to the
scattered light albedo is extremely minimal ( Kimura et al.
2006). Models for the quiescent comae, which have simi-
lar dust compositions as cited for lower porosity particles
(D=2.5,P0:4), with 25% BCCA and with steepersize distributions N3(Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. 2017b),
are more commensurate with studies of 67P/C-G’s dust
by GIADA ( Lasue et al. 2019; Fulle et al. 2015), by GI-
ADA and OSIRIS Fulle et al. (2016c), by MIDAS ( Mannel
et al. 2016; Bentley et al. 2016a), and by particle topologies
(Langevin et al. 2016).
In contrast to the quiescent coma, the outbursts are char-
acterized by sudden increase in dust thermal emission that
peaks in a few minutes and then decays towards nomi-
nal comae levels in about 30 minutes, with the outbursting
comae having hotter particles Td;color = 550K;640K,
bluer NIR scattered light colors (extreme values of S0
color =
{10%/100nmwith modeled color slope power of pcol=
2:30), and higher bolometric albedos A()bolo = 0:6,
where all three properties change with time as the outbursts
evolve. In the ﬁrst outburst, all three metrics trend together
and follow the light curve. In contrast, during the second
outburstA()boloremains high (and increasing) as the light
curve andTd;color andS0
color decay towards quiescent coma
values. During outbursts, the visible scattered light colors
remain in ranges of 10–15%/100 nmand 6–12 %/100 nm,
for the respective two dates ( Rinaldi et al. 2018). The par-
ticles are moving relatively fast compared to dust nominal
speeds for 67P/C-G, v(a <10m)30ms 1, so subse-
quent VIRTIS-H spectra sampled different sets of particles.
Particles ejected in the outburst, as modeled, are higher
in carbon (smaller qfrac), and have smaller minimum parti-
cle radii as well as having a steep DSD slope ( a0=0.1m,
4N5), which means submicron particles dominate.
Two of three metrics S0
color andTd;color are ﬁtted but the
observed high A()boloof0.6 is not ﬁtted by submicron
carbonaceous (dark, i.e., low particle albedo, and hot) par-
ticles. Somewhat larger moderately porous particles ( a0
0:5m) are in the second outburst but the highest values of
the bolometric albedo also are not explained. Pure and sub-
micron Mg:Fe olivine grains can account for the bolometric
albedo but the modeled compact ( P=0) olivine spheres have
a color temperature of <530K, which is too low to match
the observed color temperatures ( >600K). If 6 vol% FeS
is mixed with Mg:Fe amorphous olivine then the color tem-
peratures increase to 575 Kbut theS0
color cannot be ﬁt-
ted. BCCA may explain the high color temperatures but
certainly not the high albedos during outburst. A water ice
band cannot be more than 10% in depth so ice particles
are not likely driving the high bolometric albedo. Another
possibility is that there could be two distinct compositions
of submicron grains in the outbursts, one that is cold and
bright complimented by dark and hot. Bockel ´ee-Morvan
et al. (2017a) also propound that some limited lifetime or-
ganics may be mixed with the submicron Mg:Fe amorphous
olivine such that the rapid degeneration of organics may
contribute to the enhanced temperatures and enhanced albe-
dos observed during outburst, especially at the onset of the
ﬁrst outburst and the sustained albedo during the second
outburst. In summary, a dramatic increase in the numbers
of dark (carbonaceous) and smaller particles characterize
the outbursts because the “high color temperatures and blue
25colors imply the presence of Rayleigh-type scatterers in the
ejecta, i.e. either very small grains or BCCA type agglomer-
ates” ( Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. 2017a). However, the higher
A()boloin the outbursts are not explained.
2.5.8. Scattered light, limited lifetime distributed sources
Scattered light observations at UV through NIR wave-
lengths provides constraints on the structure of dust parti-
cles. Polarization ( Kolokolova et al. 2023),
the scattered light color, and the surface brightness spa-
tial distribution can provide insights into dust composition
for those dust components that contribute to scattered light.
Here are some examples that do not involve polarization
measurements.
Limited-lifetime organic species were discovered fol-
lowing outburst of C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR) and the Deep
Impact impact of 9P/Tempel 1 because they produce
wavelength-dependent scattered light ‘colors’ (slope in
%/nm) akin to a combination of organics created in the lab-
oratory by irradiating ice mixtures ( Jenniskens et al. 1993).
(Limited lifetime species associated with the dust, or ‘ex-
tended sources’ or ‘distributed sources’ also are known to
occur in some comae by the molecular production rates
having more extended spatial distributions than the water
vapor and these molecules may include CO, formaldehyde
(H2CO), NH 3, and recently discovered C 2H2(Dello Russo
et al. 2022).)
Another metric is the total scattering cross section (SA),
related to the number and intrinsic color of the dust parti-
cles:
SA =Z
( A() f) d
Tozzi et al. (2004) and Tozzi et al. (2015) used this approach
to assess limited lifetime dust that contributed the changes
in the scattered light for comets C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR)
and 9P/Tempel 1. The signiﬁcant difference between the
two comets is that C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR) has a sublimat-
ing component that scatters in the visible and 9P/Tempel 1
does not, so nature of the sublimating grains are different
between the two comets.
For C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR) at rh=1.2au, scale-
lengths for column densities of limited lifetime organics
are assessed for two components with 12250 1625km
and 940150km, and adopting a dust velocity vdust
0:2kms 1implies 1.7 hr and 17 hr coma lifetimes, respec-
tively ( Tozzi et al. 2004). The scattered light colors were
similar to minimally irradiated and long-exposure irradiated
organic residues that may be similar to the UV-irradiated
residues created on NASA’s orbiting Skylab (EURECA ( Li
and Greenberg 1997). An impulsive event offers a bet-
ter opportunity to assess the changes in surface brightness
distribution and color, that then can be used to determine
lifetimes in the coma.
Prior to the Deep Impact event, 9P/Tempel 1 has a non-
sublimating component and sublimating component (with
scale length of 6300 km, assumingvdust0:2km s 1implies 11 hr at rh=1.5au) and these two sublimating com-
ponents differ in their NIR colors. The NIR colors are as-
sessed by differencing their brightness measurements be-
tween pairs of the 2MASS photometric bands of H, J, and
Ks (deﬁned to exclude telluric absorptions and centered at
1.25m, 1.65m, and 2.17 m (Bessell 2005)). Details
about post- Deep Impact observations include that the color
was neutral from JtoHband but increases by 25% from H
toKs. Three hours later, the scattering efﬁciency increases
by 84% between JandKsso the reddening increased but
the total brightness declined. Also, there was no correlation
in the quiescent coma versus Deep Impact ejecta cloud.
One may wish to consider the “quiescent” coma of
comet 9P/Tempel 1 with the post Deep Impact coma. In the
hours following the Deep Impact encounter, polarization
images uniquely reveal an expanding front of polarizing
particles that are not detected in non-polarized images so
these particles are submicron-size (from their ejected veloc-
ities) and ’dark’ carbonaceous grains ( Kadono et al. 2007).
Spatial imaging via IR photometry as well as scattered light
colors and structures in the coma reveal properties about the
dust but with more degeneracies in the derived dust compo-
sition than with IR spectroscopy thermal modeling because
of the IR spectral resonances directly probe the composition
of the dust particles contributing to the thermal emission for
those compositions that have resonances.
3. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
3.1. Sizes and size distribution
Cometary dust is ejected from the active cometary nuclei
and expand in space following initially a quasi-spherical
shell within about 10,000 km from the nucleus, named the
coma, and further creating an expanding tail in the direction
opposite to the Sun as illustrated in Fig. 1 (see e.g. Finson
and Probstein 1968a). The striae visible in the solar direc-
tion of the impressive comet C/2006 P1 McNaught (Fig. 1),
named synchrones, represent dust ejected at different times
along the orbit of the comet, and that disperse in space due
to the effect of the parameter representing the ratio of the
forces of radiation and gravity acting on the dust particles.

depends on the dust grain’s composition, shape, structure
and size but is generally proportional to1
s, the small grains
being easily pushed away by the radiation pressure, while
the largest grains, typically 1 micrometer in size and above,
will tend to follow the orbit of the cometary nucleus around
the Sun ( Burns et al. 1979).
The extent of cometary trails is evidence that cometary
dust grains present a large range of sizes. Cometary dust
size distributions are traditionally estimated by inverting the
26cometary tails (see e.g. Finson and Probstein 1968a). While
cometary dust size distributions are typically inverted bin
size by bin size, they are canonically represented by a sim-
pler power-law distribution as it represents well the proper-
ties of the observed clouds of dust. This is represented as
aDifferential Size Distribution (DSD) with power index, N
(also called ).Nis related to , the power index of the
mass distribution of particles by N= 3 1, assuming
a constant density for the particles. If N > 3, both the
mass and brightness depend on the largest ejected grains.
Brightness and mass become decoupled if  4< N < 3
in which case the dust mass depends on the largest ejected
grains, while the brightness depends on the micrometer-
sized grains ( Fulle 2004). Typical values for the mean
power index, N, range from about -3 to about -4 (See ta-
ble 1 in Fulle 2004, for a review of ground-based derived
DSD). But one has to recognize that the actual dust size
distributions in comets are more complex and can be quite
variable with time and space due to outburst and activity
(Fulle 1987).
With the advent of space missions to active cometary nu-
clei, the ground-based observations and models of cometary
dust size distributions of the coma are now complemented
by direct measurements close to the nucleus, or laboratory
measurements from returned samples (see Table 2). How-
ever, those measurements cannot directly be compared as
their relationship is complicated by fragmentation of parti-
cles, sublimation of volatiles, differential speed of ejection,
and surface inhomogeneous activity (see Agarwal et al.
2007, and references therein).
In situ data on the dust mass distribution was obtained
for 1P/Halley by the Vega 1 ,Vega 2 andGiotto mission-
sin 1986 ( Divine and Newburn 1988). McDonnell et al.
(1987) used the dust impact detection system (DIDSY) on-
board Giotto to derive a double size distribution at the nu-
cleus of 1P/Halley with N= 4:06for small particles
(m < 10 8kg) andN= 3:13for larger particles ( m >
10 8kg). The average DSD prior to close approach was
estimated at the nucleus to be N= 3:490:15(McDon-
nell et al. 1986). Fulle et al. (1995) developed a model of
1P/Halley dust emissions to ﬁt the DIDSY ﬂuences and ob-
tained a constant DSD index of N= 3:50:2for grains
larger than 20m. Later combined models of optical and
impact measurements resulted in a value of N= 2:60:2
(Fulle et al. 2000). The interpretation of Halley data did not
lead to a general agreement regarding the dust size distribu-
tion at the nucleus of the comet, however it is generally ad-
mitted that the coma is dominated by millimetre-sized and
larger particles ( Agarwal et al. 2007). The Giotto space
mission continued its exploration of comets with a close ﬂy-
by of comet 26P/Grigg–Skjellerup in 1992. The dust distri-
bution detected in that case corresponds to N= 1:81for
particles with mass larger than m> 10 9kg indicating for
this comet a coma dominated by large particles ( McDonnell
et al. 1993).
In 2005, the Deep Impact mission collided with comet
9P/Tempel 1, excavating a crater about 150 m large andseveral 10s of meters deep, which helped decipher the
composition and low strength of the near subsurface lay-
ers of cometary nuclei. The impact generated a strong
ejection of fresh ice and dust particles that was akin to a
cometary activity outburst ( A’Hearn et al. 2005). Simi-
larly, the DSD index measured in the coma after the impact
(N= 4:50:2(Lisse et al. 2006)) demonstrates a strong
increase in the DSD slope as compared to the pre-impact
coma value ( N= 3:00:45(Lisse et al. 2005)) corre-
sponding to a sharp increase in the number of small parti-
cles present in the coma liberated by the impact. Evidence
from the changes in activity, in gas composition, and in dust
particles DSD were used to argue that pristine cometary ma-
terial was present a few 10s of meters below the surface of
cometary nuclei ( A’Hearn et al. 2005). The Deep Impact
mission was then diverted towards comet 103P/Hartley 2.
This very active small comet nucleus ejects very large par-
ticles, some of which are made of pure water ice ( A’Hearn
et al. 2011). Observations from the ground indicated rela-
tively steep DSD indices, from  3:20:1(Epifani et al.
2001) to 3:910:3(Bauer et al. 2011). The in situ
dust size distribution obtained by the space probe was even
steeper with a value ranging from  6:6to 4:7, but appli-
cable to the largest dust particles sizes detected by photom-
etry, from 1 cm to 20 cm in the case of icy particles ( Kelley
et al. 2013).
In 2006, the Stardust mission delivered samples from
comet 81P/Wild 2 to Earth for laboratory analysis ( Brown-
lee et al. 2006). During the comet ﬂy-by, the Dust Flux
Monitor Instrument (DFMI) monitored the dust impacts
with a high temporal resolution and gave evidence of frag-
mentation of dust particles within the coma. The size distri-
butions detected by the probe are quite variable with a best
ﬁt value of 3:25for particle masses lower than 10 8kg at
around closest approach, but with values as high as  1:99
and as low as 4:39depending on the coma region probed
(Tuzzolino et al. 2004; Green et al. 2004). However, addi-
tional information could be retrieved from the laboratory
analyses of the tracks in the aerogel and the craters on
the aluminum foils of the return capsule, using calibrations
made on Earth by impacting with analog compact particles.
The resulting DSD index corresponds to  2:71(H¨orz et al.
2006). Further recalibration on the ground taking into ac-
count impacts by aggregates of silica particles slightly re-
vised this value to a lower one of N= 2:89for particles
larger than 10 microns, more compatible with the average
value given by DFMI ( Price et al. 2010).
Finally, the Rosetta space mission was the only cometary
space probe that could survey a comet nucleus over a ma-
jor part of its orbital trajectory ( Glassmeier et al. 2007) for
a period spanning 2 years and a half. The ground-based
size distribution of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
was determined to be N= 3:40:2from an average of
previous observations since its discovery ( Fulle 2004, and
references therein). During the Rosetta mission survey, the
dust size distribution showed a strong time-evolution, with
the optical cross-section dominated by the largest ejected
27dust far from perihelion with N 3, while the smallest
ejected dust dominate around perihelion with N 3:9
(Moreno et al. 2017).
TheRosetta space mission also used its many dust anal-
ysis instruments (GIADA, COSIMA, Osiris, ROLIS) to de-
termine the dust size distribution in many complementary
size ranges from 1m to 1 m. Fig. 14 summarizes the re-
sults obtained for all these different measurements before
the 2015 equinox, around the perihelion time in August
2015 and the size distribution of boulders on the surface
of 2 landing areas studied for Philae. Overall the DSD in-
dex measured by Rosetta is consistent with an average value
around 4, with variations due to the timings of measure-
ments with smaller particles typically ejected around peri-
helion time.
In addition, over the last ﬁve years, the Solar System
was visited by 2 interstellar objects (1I/Oumuamua and
2I/Borisov). Fortunately, interstellar comet 2I/Borisov was
active enough that its coma and tail could be studied by
telescopic observations. In that case, the DSD is also rang-
ing from 3:7to 4(see Table 2) which is consistent with
most active comets and also ’fresh’ comets such as C/1995
O1 (Hale-Bopp) or C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake) ( Fulle 2004,
and references therein)
In summary, cometary dust size distributions usually
correspond well to power laws, with typical indices rang-
ing from 3to 4. However large variations are detected
depending on the activity of the nucleus, the timing of mea-
surements and the techniques used. The consistency of
all measurements made so far are certainly consistent with
probing the DSD of primordial building blocks of comets
as the DSD index for active comets is consistent over all
types of comets, including ’fresh’ ones and even interstellar
comet 2I/Borisov.
Further analysis of cometary dust ejected at different
times will certainly improve our knowledge of the dust size
properties and how they may relate to primordial solar neb-
ula materials.
3.2. Optical and thermal properties
Light scattering has historically been the main provider
of information on the physical properties of cometary dust
through telescopic studies (for more details see Kolokolova
et al. 2015, 2023) The observations made in several do-
mains have been useful in constraining the size, size dis-
tribution, structure and optical indices of the dust parti-
cles. The observations in the visible domain have been
used to model the extension of the coma and tail of comets
(Haser et al. 2020; Finson and Probstein 1968a,b) and de-
duce from it the surface activity of the nucleus. In the case
of the dust particles in the coma of comet 67P/C-G, they
present a speciﬁc scattering phase function with a u-shape
and minimum at intermediate phase angles. This is differ-
ent from the phase function that was usually considered for
cometary dust ( Kolokolova et al. 2004). The color is con-
sistent with the average of the nucleus surface below 30ofphase angles. There is negligible phase reddening at phase
angles<90indicating a coma dominated by single scat-
tering ( Bertini et al. 2017). Such a phase curve shape may
be consistent with crushed primitive meteorites, but even
more with analogues developed to simulated the scatter-
ing properties of interplanetary dust particles ( Levasseur-
Regourd et al. 2019). Photometric studies of single grains
with the OSIRIS camera ﬁlters from 535 to 882 nm in-
dicate slopes covering the ranges of slopes detected over
the reddest to bluest regions of the nucleus ( Frattin et al.
2017). Assuming that the majority of dust particles in the
zodiacal cloud come from comets, their average geometric
albedo towards the Gegenschein has been determined to be
0:060:01, similar to the low albedo detected for cometary
nuclei ( Ishiguro et al. 2013).
The coma and tails of comets are astronomical objects
that present some of the largest polarization detected in the
solar system (for more details see Kolokolova et al. 2015,
2023). Polarimetric observations of comets give comple-
mentary information to the scattering properties of the dust
particles, in particular on their optical indices and mor-
phologies. Initial polarimetric observations of comet Halley
combined with Mie light scattering simulations and labora-
tory work comparisons already indicated that the scattering
particles were likely large, rough with a low albedo, and it
was shown that material from the Orgueil meteorite was a
good scattering analogue ( Kikuchi et al. 1988; Mukai et al.
1988; Dollfus 1989). It was also recognized that polarimet-
ric properties of dust particles were signiﬁcantly changed
during outbursts ( Dollfus et al. 1988) and varied related to
jet structures in the coma when the Giotto mission crossed
them ( Levasseur-Regourd et al. 1999). Since then, im-
proved models of cometary dust particles have been devel-
oped that may include a diversity of material mixtures (sil-
icates, organics, ices, etc.) and morphologies, such as hol-
low spheres, irregular particles, spheroids and aggregates
thereof (see e.g. Hanner 2003; Min2005; Lasue et al. 2009;
Kolokolova and Kimura 2010; Zubko et al. 2015, and refer-
ences therein).
Polarimetric observations of 67P/C-G have been per-
formed during both 2008 and 2015 perihelion passages
(Hadamcik et al. 2010, 2016; Rosenbush et al. 2017).
Agglomerates of sub-micrometer-sized grains best ﬁt the
higher polarization observed in cometary jets and after
fragmentation or disruption events, while a mixture of
porous agglomerates of submicrometer-sized Mg-silicates,
Fe-silicates, and carbon black grains mixed with compact
Mg-silicates grains is generally needed to ﬁt whole comae
observations ( Hadamcik et al. 2006, 2007). Simple geo-
metric shapes of dust particles are generally poor ﬁts to the
observational cometary data ( Kolokolova et al. 2004). Nu-
merical simulations strongly suggest that cometary dust is a
mixture of (possibly fractal) agglomerates and of compact
particles of both non-absorbing silicate-type materials and
more absorbing organic-type materials (see e.g. Lasue et al.
2009; Kiselev et al. 2015). The variety, structure and size
distribution of agglomerates and grains is consistent with

the general description of dust particles detected at 67P-C-
G by Rosetta (G¨uttler et al. 2019; Mannel et al. 2019).
Observations in the infrared and thermal wavelength
ranges give speciﬁc information on the dust particle size
distribution and their spatial distribution and dynamics in
the cometary coma and tail ( Agarwal et al. 2007). In the
particular case of 67P/C-G, VIRTIS observations of the
dust in the coma from 2 to 5 m, generally show a tem-
perature a few per cents above the equilibrium, but it in-
creases 3 to 4 fold during outbursts. This may be related
to the ejection of much smaller dust particles during out-
bursts (size <100nm) ( Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al. 2017a).
Such small particles are not detected by other Rosetta in-
struments, indicating a collecting bias or a dearth of such
particles in the cometary environment.
A general model of light scattering and emission by dust
particles consistent with all the observed constraints re-
mains to be elaborated.
3.3. Morphology
The morphology of dust particles corresponds to the spa-
tial arrangement of their constituting components and is of-
ten described by parameters such as the porosity, which in-
dicates the ratio of voids to occupied volume, or the frac-tal dimension, a measure of the self-similarity at different
scales of the assemblages. It is critical to study the mor-
phology of cometary dust particles as these properties are
essential to better understand the physical properties of the
dust, such as strength, thermal and light scattering prop-
erties of the dust, but may also be witness to the primi-
tive aggregation processes in the primordial nebula. Ini-
tially, polarimetric observations of comets have suggested
that the basic morphology of cometary dust particles was
best explained by including a combination of porous ag-
gregates and more compact dust particles (see e.g. Lasue
et al. 2009; Kolokolova et al. 2015, 2023) As the Stardust
samples were analyzed in the laboratory, the impacts on the
aluminium foils and the aerogel demonstrated the presence
of both compact and porous, easily fragmented dust parti-
cles ( Brownlee 2014). However, the samples were altered
by the speed of collection reaching about 6 m.s 1. IDPs
collected from the stratosphere also indicate a diversity of
morphologies including very porous fragile aggregates as
well as more compact particles, however, the effect of at-
mospheric traverse, collection by plane and unknown spe-
ciﬁc origin of the particles makes it difﬁcult to relate their
precise morphologies to a particular Solar System body or
physics phenomenon (see e.g. Brownlee 2016).

was the initial landing site of Philae, and Sais was the ﬁnal landing site of the Rosetta spacecraft.
To date, the microscopes on-board the Rosetta space
mission have provided the best in situ morphological anal-
ysis of cometary dust particles collected at low speeds of
1 to 15 m.s 1(Fulle et al. 2015) and distances from the
nucleus lower than 500 km. The scale ranges accessible
to both the atomic force microscope MIDAS and the mi-
croscope and mass spectrometer COSIMA were <1m to
1 mm with topographic information also available ( Bent-
ley et al. 2016b; Mannel et al. 2019; Hilchenbach et al.
2016). These scales also correspond to the smallest (1 m,
Bentley et al. (2016b); Mannel et al. (2019)) and largest
(350m,Langevin et al. (2016)) particles detected. All par-
ticles present textural substructures identiﬁed as aggregated
monomers which classiﬁes them generally as “compact ag-
gregates” ( G¨uttler et al. 2019). Additionally, it has been
shown that collected particles have a tendency to breakup
as they impact the plates and produce clusters of fragments
with a variety of morphologies ranging from shattered, ﬂat-
tened particles to rubble piles ( Langevin et al. 2016). Such
a diverse set of morphologies can originate from a single
type of aggregates and be related to different incoming ve-
locities and tensile strength of the particles ( Hornung et al.
2016; Ellerbroek et al. 2017, 2019; Lasue et al. 2019).
In fact, many compact aggregates analyzed by COSIMAfragmented into smaller constituents during analysis due to
electrostatic forces ( Hilchenbach et al. 2017), demonstrat-
ing the relationship between the fragments and their parent
compact aggregate particles. Similar fragmentation upon
collection have been shown to occur for MIDAS as well
(Bentley et al. 2016b). The surface features detected by
the two microscopes on-board at their respective scales are
reminiscent of those found in chondritic porous interplane-
tary dust particles as illustrated in Fig. 1.
The extension of the morphological analysis to the low-
est scales accessible by MIDAS have shown that the small-
est aggregate dust particles units are down to 8 nm in size
with most of the dust particles being fragile agglomerated
dust particles and small micrometer-sized dust particles also
formed of those subunits ( Mannel et al. 2019). A fragile ag-
glomerate was also determined to have a fractal dimension
of about 1.7 ( Mannel et al. 2016) consistent with very ﬂuffy
dust particles measured by the impact GIADA instrument
(Fulle et al. 2015). Even though they do not present a sig-
niﬁcant fraction of the mass of the cometary nucleus, such
fragile particles would not survive most impacts of the early
solar system accretion phase and their detection favors an
accretion of planetesimals under the gravitational collapse
of pebble model ( Fulle and Blum 2017; Blum et al. 2017).
30In summary, we ﬁnd that the cometary dust particles
present an apparent scale invariance of properties similar
to those that would result from a fractal aggregation pro-
cess, consistent with the one that would be expected to be
at work during the early stages of the planetary formation
in the early Solar System (see e.g. Blum 2018). The results
the microscopes obtained on dust collected from 67P/C-
G together with many other in situ measurements by the
Rosetta space mission provide the ﬁrst view of the hierar-
chical structure of dust in comets as reviewed in G¨uttler
et al. (2019).
3.4. Tensile strength
Laboratory simulations of macroscopic agglomerates of
small silica dust particles (diameters ranging from 0.1 to 10
m) by ballistic deposition were realized to simulate early
aggregation of dust particles similar to the ones forming
comets. The tensile strength of such resulting aggregates,
the size of which may reach several centimeters, range from
1 to 6 kPa ( Blum and Schr ¨apler 2004; G¨uttler et al. 2009;
Meisner et al. 2012). A more realistic set of simulations
using silica dust particles and water ice particles under low
temperatures (150 K) showed that the tensile strength
decreases linearly with the particles diameter, ranging from
4kPa to 18kPa in agreement with previous estimates ( Gund-
lach et al. 2018). Additionally, the experiments demon-
strated that under low temperatures, the tensile strength of
water ice aggregates was comparable to the data for the sil-
ica spheres. This means that at low temperatures water ice
presents a speciﬁc surface energy similar to the one of sil-
ica, which was not expected. Perhaps at temperatures above
150 K, the surface energy of water ice increases steeply, or
sintering effects take place. Few direct measurements of the
ejected solid material of comets are available, however, the
tensile strength of dust particles ejected from 67P/C-G was
estimated to be of the order of 1kPa from the study of the
fragments distribution observed with the COSIMA experi-
ment on-board Rosetta (Hornung et al. 2016). Similarly,
the meteor showers breakup observed in the Earth atmo-
sphere can give estimates of cometary dust tensile strengths
since they are associated with parent comets ( Jenniskens
and Jenniskens 2006). The derived tensile strengths are
again extremely low, and of the same order of magnitude
of the other estimates depending on the parent comet: from
40 to 1000 Pa in Trigo-Rodr ´ıguez and Llorca (2006) and
from 0.4 to 150 kPa as presented in Table 2 of Blum et al.
(2014). A more detailed synthesis of tensile strength values
for cometary materials at different scales of the cometary
nucleus can be found in Fig. 10 of Groussin et al. (2019).
3.5. Density
The density of cometary dust particles is closely related
to their morphology and their porosity, deﬁned as 1 minus
the volume ﬁlling factor of the particle. As described in
§3.3, two main morphological types of dust particles have
been detected from cometary ejection: compact dust par-ticles and very ﬂuffy aggregated dust particles following
the classiﬁcation made by G¨uttler et al. (2019). This was
seen ﬁrst by the Stardust samples brought back to Earth,
where high-speed impacts of 81P/Wild 2 particles gener-
ated carrot-like aerogel tracks for compact particles (65% of
tracks) and bulbous tracks consistent with the disruption of
ﬂuffy aggregates (35% of tracks) ( Brownlee 2014; Burchell
et al. 2008; Trigo-Rodriguez et al. 2008)
These observations are consistent with the particle de-
tections of GIADA for which compact and ﬂuffy dust par-
ticles are detected ( Della Corte et al. 2015). The strength
of the compact particles is consistent with a microporos-
ity ranging from 34% to 85% ( Levasseur-Regourd et al.
2018). Dust showers observed by GIADA can only be ex-
plained by fractal aggregates with dimensions lower than 2
getting fragmented a few meters from the spacecraft ( Fulle
et al. 2015), this represents about 30% of the dust detected
(Fulle and Blum 2017). MIDAS also detected an extremely
porous particle with fractal dimension Df= 1:70:1
which would translate to a porosity around 99% ( Mannel
et al. 2016; Mannel et al. 2019; Fulle and Blum 2017). Fol-
lowing G¨uttler et al. (2019), ﬂuffy aggregated particles are
expected to have a microporosity >90%. Studies of the
mean free path of light through particles fragments detected
by COSIMA have also indicated a microporosity >50%
(Langevin et al. 2017).
The GIADA measurements combine both the geometric
cross section of the particles and the momentum of impact,
which allows to retrieve the average density of the parti-
cles. The value obtained over 271 compact particles detec-
tions gives= 785+520
 115kg m 3, at1conﬁdence level
(Fulle et al. 2017). With a dust microporosity estimated
to be 598%, this corresponds to a bulk density of com-
pacted and dried dust of 1925+2030
 560 kg m 3, at1(Fulle
et al. 2017). Additionally, a signiﬁcant fraction of dust par-
ticles detected by GIADA has a bulk density larger than
4000 kg m 3. Those are interpreted as single grain min-
erals similar to single mineral tracks in Stardust (Burchell
et al. 2008).
3.6. Electrical properties
As dust particles are ejected from a comet, they get ex-
posed to space plasma and UV radiations and become elec-
trically charged, which inﬂuences their motion ( Hor´anyi
1996). While there were evidence of particle charging in the
coma of 1P/Halley from the calculations of particles trajec-
tories ( Ellis and Neff 1991), the Rosetta mission provided
the ﬁrst direct evidence of electrically charged nanodust
particles in a cometary coma ( Burch et al. 2015; LLera et al.
2020). It is typically estimated that a 10 19kg dust particle
will be disrupted by its charging if its tensile strength is less
than about 0.5 MPa ( Mendis and Hor ´anyi 2013).
The dust showers detected by GIADA have been mod-
elled in terms of mm-sized ﬂuffy dust aggregates charged
by the ﬂux of secondary electrons from the spacecraft de-
creasing their electric potential by 7 to 15V ( Fulle et al.
312015). The particles are disrupted by their interaction with
the electric ﬁeld of the spacecraft, their deceleration pro-
vides the appropriate kinetic energy to explain the RPC/IES
charged nanodust detections of 0.2 to 20keV ( Fulle et al.
2016b). The predicted fractal dimension of such ﬂuffy ag-
gregates is about 2, consistent with the fractal dimensions
measured by MIDAS on some particles ( Mannel et al. 2016;
Mannel et al. 2019,Df= 1:70:1).
During COSIMA TOF-SIMS measurements, partial
charging of the collected dust particles allowed the direct
determination of their bulk electrical properties like their
speciﬁc resistivity ( >1:21010
m) and the real part of
their relative electrical permittivity ( <1:2) (Hornung et al.
2020). These values are consistent with a dust porosity
larger than 80%.
4. FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Analysis of the 81P/Wild 2 coma grains in particular has
revealed how similar inorganic comet solids are to some as-
teroidal materials, at least for comet Wild 2. The obser-
vation of crystalline silicates in Hale-Bopp, and the pres-
ence in the coma of comet Wild 2 of a signiﬁcant fraction
of coarse-grained inorganic mineral grains, including very
refractory materials, was largely unexpected, and has pro-
foundly inﬂuenced models of early solar system dynamics.
The apparent lack of a signiﬁcant fraction of amorphous and
presolar materials in Wild 2 was another surprise, although
the collection process in aerogel may have signiﬁcantly de-
stroyed these materials. The nature of cometary organics
was not a major goal of the Stardust mission, and thus great
uncertainty remains for this topic. The Rosetta mission con-
tributed to the analysis of cometary organics, conﬁrming
that cometary particles can contain a large proportion of or-
ganics (as ﬁrst seen in the CHON grains in comet Halley),
and that this organic matter bears some similarities with the
refractory organics present in carbonaceous chondrites. The
organic matter present in CA-IDPs and in CP-MMs also
bear similarities with that of carbonaceous chondrites, as
for two of the three organic phases identiﬁed in UCAMMs.
The formation of the N-rich organic phase in UCAMMs
could have been made by irradiation of N-rich ices in the
outer regions of the protoplanetary disk, by Galactic cosmic
rays. The formation and incorporation mechanisms of min-
eral and organic components in comets are not yet fully un-
derstood. Cometary dust (or the ice that initially contained
it) also carry soluble organics like amino acids. Cometary
dust thus could have contributed to the input of prebiotic
matter on the early Earth. The presence of a “continuum”
between asteroidal and cometary matter is now considered
seriously, asteroidal components being found in cometary
material, and cometary activity being observed in asteroids
(the so-called ”main-belt comets”).
Thus, despite great recent progress in our understand-
ing of comets, critical gaps remain concerning the forma-
tion and processing of organics, condensation of inorganic
volatiles, nature and role of presolar dust in the evolutionof early nebular solids, timing and location of condensa-
tion and processing of cometary materials, possible role of
radiogenic nuclides including26Al... The comparison be-
tween properties of cometary dust deduced by astronomical
observations or analyzed by different techniques also some-
times shows discrepancies. In order to address these issues,
a cryogenic sample return from a comet nucleus would be a
dream, with well preserved cometary samples available for
analysis in terrestrial laboratories ( Bockel ´ee-Morvan et al.
2019). For the time being, it however remains just that - a
dream.
