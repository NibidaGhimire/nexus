Abstract. We study the vanishing viscosity limit for the three-dimens ional
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in terms of the rel ative vorticity in the
setting of axisymmetric velocity ﬁelds without swirl. We sh ow that the weak
convergence of relative vorticity to a renormalized soluti on of the Euler equa-
tions, established by Nobili and Seis, can be upgraded to str ong convergence.
1.Introduction
The evolution of an incompressible viscous ﬂow can be descri bed by the 3D
Navier-Stokes equations



∇x·uν= 0,

where for given viscosity ν >0, at a point (t,x)in space-time uν=uν(t,x)∈R3
represents the velocity ﬁeld, pν=pν(t,x)∈Ris the pressure, fν=fν(t,x)∈R3
is an external force, and uν
0(x)is the initial velocity. Since the pioneering work of
Leray [23] in 1934, in which he proved global existence for a c lass of weak solutions
for (1.1), uniqueness in this Leray-Hopf class has remained an open issue for general
external forces, although very recently non-uniqueness ha s been demonstrated for
a speciﬁc force [3] (see also [20, 4, 15, 18, 17] for indicatio ns of non-uniqueness of
Leray-Hopf solutions).
In the presence of certain symmetries, the situation is much better. A partic-
ularly important case is that of axisymmetry without swirl , described in detail in
Section 2 below. The idea is that this symmetry reduces the nu mber of degrees
of freedom in the domain to two (the radial and the vertical, b ut not the angular
coordinate), so that the axisymmetric 3Dequations should behave similarly as the
2Dequations.
Accordingly, global existence and uniqueness of weak solut ions for (1.1) were
proved in the setting of axisymmetric initial data without s wirl [34] for initial ve-
locities inL2, initial vorticities in L2∩L∞, initial relative vorticities in L2∩L∞
and forces in L1

x. Around the same time, Ladyzhenskaya gave an independent
proof in [20]. A few decades later, Leonardi et al. gave a reﬁn ed proof [22] for initial
velocities in H2and external forces in L2

x. This result was then upgraded [1] to
initial data in H1

In two dimensions, the theory for the Navier-Stokes equatio ns is rather complete.
For instance, weak solutions are known to exist globally, to be unique and even
regular. We refer to [7, 21, 24, 32, 12, 33] for an overview of c lassical results in
two dimensions. As mentioned, the axisymmetric 3Dequations can be viewed as

related to the 2Dcase, and indeed one can write out (1.1) in cylindrical coord inates
as to arrive at a formulation which resembles the 2DNavier-Stokes system. More
precisely, this means that (1.1) is studied in the half-plan eHinstead of the whole
R3, cf. (2.3) below. On that account, the well-developed theor y of the Navier-
Stokes equation in two dimensions is helpful for the study of the3Daxisymmetric
situation, which is not to say that the two-dimensional theo ry simply transfers
in every respect. In particular, genuinely three-dimensio nal eﬀects such as vortex-
stretching appear. This is for instance the case in the vorticity formulation of (1.1),
where the velocity ﬁeld can be reconstructed from the vortic ityων:= curluνby

axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations without swirl, writ ten in cylindrical coordi-
nates, then becomes

where the spatial diﬀerential operators are taken with resp ect to the cylindrical
variables (r,z)∈HandGis the kernel of the 3DBiot-Savart law restricted to the
axisymmetric swirl-free setting. Also, by abuse of notatio n we wrote ωνfor the
angular component of vorticity (the radial and vertical com ponents are both zero).
This system was recently studied in [14] with homogeneous Di richlet boundary
condition. There, the authors established global well-pos edness of mild solutions
for initial vorticities in L1. Moreover, they studied the 3DBiot-Savart law in the
setting of axisymmetry without swirl, which in particular e xhibits similarities to
the Biot-Savart law in two dimensions [14, Section 2].
In this present paper, we study the important problem of the vanishing viscosity
limit. The question is whether, and in what sense, the solutions of (1.2) converge as
the viscosity νց0. Formally, of course, one expects the limit to be a solution t o the
incompressible Euler equations (to be discussed in a moment ). In the axisymmetric
setting without swirl, when the relative vorticity ξν=ων
ris initially in L1∩Lp(R3)
for some 1<p<∞, this is true, and our main result says that the ξνwillstrongly
converge in Lp, uniformly in time. The rigorous formulation of our result i s given
below in Theorem 3.1.
In the inviscid framework, the evolution of an incompressib le ﬂuid is described
by the3DEuler equations


∂tu+u·∇xu+∇xp=fin(0,T)×R3,
∇x·u= 0,
u(0,·) =u0,(1.3)
where the variables have the same meaning as before. Global w ell-posedness of
smooth solutions is still unresolved, while on the positive side local-well posedness
results are classically known [26, Section 2.5]. In the axis ymmetric no-swirl setting,
global well-posedness was settled in [34] under the assumpt ionsω0,ω0
r∈L2∩L∞
andf∈L1

x. This result was improved [10] to L∞initial vorticities lying in theON THE VANISHING VISCOSITY LIMIT FOR 3D AXISYMMETRIC FLOWS 3
Lorentz space L3,1and relative vorticities in L3,1. Moreover, for smooth initial data
this was carried out in [30, 25] under some additional assump tions on the initial
vorticity. For a corresponding result in certain Besov spac es we refer to [2].
As mentioned, the small viscosity behaviour is a very import ant concern in this
context. In the axisymmetric setting and for zero right-han d sides, results for the
nonzero swirl case can be found for instance in [16, 31]. In th e case of zero swirl,
the small viscosity behaviour for the axisymmetric Navier- Stokes equations was
investigated in [19, 28] within the relative vorticity form ulation (ξν=ων

[28, Theorem 1.2], where renormalization is understood in t he sense of DiPerna-
Lions [11].
In the two dimensional framework two recent works [6, 29] hig hlighted that the
established weak∗convergence of the vorticity can be upgraded to strong conve r-
gence inCtLp
x, for1<p<∞. While in [6] the authors established the convergence
on the torus and on the whole space with some convergence rate s in the torus
case, in [29] the convergence was shown on the torus with poss ible forcing term.
The main goal of this paper is to establish strong convergenc e ofξνinCtLp
x, for
1<p<∞, in the axisymmetric case without swirl, including a forcin g term.
Now, let us highlight the main diﬃculties compared to [6] and [29]. Due to
the axisymmetry and without swirl-free property, (1.4) and (1.5) are stated in two
dimensions whereas we want to show convergence in three dime nsions. Technical
diﬃculties arise in adapting the proof for the two dimension al setting in [6] since it
is not possible to derive a bound for the velocity ﬁelds uνinL1+L∞(R3)which
was crucial in the proof of Ciampa et al. To overcome this diﬃc ulty, we have to
use a suitable cut-oﬀ function in a way that the scaling arisi ng from cylindrical
coordinates can be controlled properly. Moreover, in the se nse of the axisymmetric
setting, our result can also be seen as an extension of [6] to e xternal forces. Ul-
timately, let us note that we cannot use directly the argumen ts in [29] to prove
strong convergence, since there the compactness of the toru s is exploited.
We conclude this introduction with some comments on the nonz ero swirl case. Op-
posed to the zero swirl setting, the situation is diﬀerent in that global-well posedness
is still open for the Euler equations. However, for the Navie r-Stokes equations pos-
itive answers were for instance given for small angular init ial velocity in L3[5] and4 PATRICK BRKIC AND EMIL WIEDEMANN
for smallness ofuν
0√rinL4[35]. Furthermore in [27], conditions on the radial and an-
gular components of the velocity were derived for weak solut ions to become strong
solutions. See also [13] for a weak-strong uniqueness resul t.
2.The axisymmetric swirl-free setting
Deﬁnition 2.1. Letu=u(r,θ,z)be a vector ﬁeld in cylindrical coordinates (r,θ,z)
and
er= (cos(θ),sin(θ),0), eθ= (−sin(θ),cos(θ),0), ez= (0,0,1)
be the unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates.
(i)uis called axisymmetric ifuhas cylindrical symmetry in space, i.e., u=
u(r,z).
(ii)uis called swirl-free if its angular component vanishes, i.e., uθ=u·eθ= 0.
In the ﬁrst step we want to reformulate (1.1) in the framework of axisymmetry
without swirl. If we assume that the swirl component of the ve locity vanishes, we
can pass to cylindrical coordinates and observe that the adv ection term may be
rewritten as
uν·∇xuν=uν·∇uν, (2.1)
where∇x= (∂x,∂y,∂z)is the gradient in Cartesian variables x,y,z , and∇=
(∂r,∂z)is the gradient in cylindrical variables r,z. Moreover, if we include cylin-
drical symmetry in space, the Cartesian Laplacian becomes
∆x=∂2
r+1
r∂r+∂2
z=:∆+1
r∂r (2.2)
in cylindrical coordinates. Now, for uν,fνaxisymmetric and without swirl we
consider the associated initial boundary value problem to ( 1.1)

a consequence of the cylindrical symmetries, the vorticity ωνis only toroidal and
becomes (∂zuν

where˜gν(r,z) =rgν(r,z) =rcurlfν·eθ. Analogously, we consider the following
initial boundary value problem for the Euler equations (1.3 ):


∂tu+u·∇u+∇p=fin(0,T)×H,
ur= 0 on∂H,
u(0,·) =u0 inH,
∂r(rur)+∂z(ruz) = 0.(2.5)
In the inviscid limit of (2.4), the associated transport equ ation for the relative
vorticity then becomes


∂tξ+u·∇ξ=g in(0,T)×H,
∂rξ= 0 on∂H,
ξν|t=0=ξν
0 inH,
u=G∗ω,f=G∗˜g,(2.6)
and˜g(r,z) =rg(r,z) =rcurlf·eθ.
Remark 2.2. In our arguments it will sometimes be more convenient to work
in the two-dimensional setting, i.e., in H, and sometimes in the three-dimensional
setting. By abuse of notation, we will denote a function the s ame no matter whether
its arguments are Cartesian or cylindrical coordinates, i.e. , we write for instance
F(x) =F(r,z).
We will use (2.1)and(2.2)to switch between the two-and three-dimensional
settings. Moreover, for axisymmetric functions F=F(r,z)we will frequently use
the integral transformation

Furthermore uis a distributional solution of (2.5)andξis a renormalized solution
of(2.4).
Proof. The proof is mostly a review of the unforced case [28, Theorem 1] and [28,
Theorem 2]. The convergence can be shown as in [28, Theorem 1] with almost no
changes. In the case of f= 0the argument for renormalization [28, Theorem 2]
follows [9] and relies on a duality argument of DiPerna-Lion s [11]. Therefore the
proof can be adopted if we include the forcing term in the dual ity formula [11,
Theorem II.6]. /squareON THE VANISHING VISCOSITY LIMIT FOR 3D AXISYMMETRIC FLOWS 7
3.Strong convergence for Navier-Stokes equation in vorticit y
formulation
WithLp
c(R3)we shall denote the set of Lp-functions with compact (essential)
support. Let us now state our main theorem:
Theorem 3.1. Letp>1andξ0∈Lp
c(R3)axisymmetric. Let R>0and(ξν
0)ν⊂
Lp
c(Rn)be axisymmetric and so that supp(ξν
0)⊂BR(0)for allν >0, andξν
0→ξ0
inLp(R3).
Let(gν)νbe a sequence of axisymmetric functions bounded in L1((0,T),L1∩
Lp(R3))andg∈L1((0,T),L1∩Lp(R3))be axisymmetric such that gν→gin
L1((0,T),Lp(R3)). Letuνandξνbe the solution of (1.4) with initial datum ξν
0
and right hand side gν. Further let ξbe a renormalized solution of (1.5) such that
ξνk⇀∗ξinL∞((0,T),Lp(R3))for a subsequence (νk)k∈N.
Then the relative vorticities converge strongly,
ξνk→ξinC([0,T],Lp(R3)).
In order to prove this, we will ﬁrst deal with an auxiliary res ult for the inviscid
limit in the axisymmetric swirl-free framework. Recall tha t the3Daxisymmetric
swirl-free transport equation and advection-diﬀusion equ ation may be reformulated
in the half-plane Has we pointed out in the introduction. To this end, consider t he
initial value problem for the transport equation

∂rρ= 0 on∂H,

In the forthcoming lemma we want to extend [6, Lemma 3.3], in w hich the authors
established a result of convergence without external force s, to the case with external
forces in the axisymmetric framework. Note that the result i n [6] does not depend
on the dimension while we will focus on the axisymmetric thre e-dimensional case
without swirl.

(ρν

gν→ginL1((0,T),Lp(R3))for some 1<p<∞. (3.13)
Letρν∈L∞((0,T),L1∩L∞(R3))be the unique solution of (3.2) and let ρ∈
L∞((0,T),L1∩L∞(R3))be the unique solution of (3.1). Then for all 1≤q <∞
we have
ρν→ρinC([0,T],Lq(R3)).
Remark 3.3. Under the conditions (3.3)-(3.13) there indeed exist unique solutions
ρ,ρν∈L∞((0,T),L1∩L∞(R3))of the corresponding weak formulations in (0,T)×
R3of(3.1)and(3.2), which are in fact renormalized. A proof for the case f= 0
can be found in [11, Theorem II.3]. In the general case the argume nts can be adopted
with almost no changes.
Proof of Lemma 3.2. First, recall that for any p∈[1,∞]we have the following
estimate thanks to Lemma 2.6:
/ba∇dblρν(t)/ba∇dblp
Lp(R3)≤C/parenleftBig
/ba∇dblρν
0/ba∇dblp
Lp(R3)+/ba∇dblgν/ba∇dblp
L1((0,T),Lp(R3))/parenrightBig
. (3.14)
Due to (3.3), (3.4) and (3.12), equation (3.14) implies that (ρν)νis equibounded
inL∞((0,T),L1∩L∞(R3))andρν
0⇀∗ρ0inL∞((0,T),Lp(R3)). Moreover there
exists˜ρ∈L∞((0,T),L1∩L∞(R3))such that along a subsequence we have for any
p∈(1,∞)
ρν⇀∗˜ρinL∞((0,T),Lp(R3)).
Thanks to the linearity one can immediately deduce that ˜ρis a distributional solu-
tion of (3.1) with initial datum ρ0, and hence due to uniqueness ˜ρ=ρ. Thus, the
whole sequence is converging.

This establishes

Together with the fact that ρν⇀ ρinL2(0,T;L2(R3))we accomplish ρν→ρin
L2(0,T;L2(R3)).
As a consequence of this convergence, we obtain that there is no ‘anomalous

Note thatfϕis continuous since solutions of (3.1) with initial data in Lqare known

which can be seen to be bounded by virtue of (3.14), (3.11) and (3.12). Note that
we exploited the axisymmetry and swirl-free property of bνanalogously to (2.1)
in order to swap bν· ∇ϕwithbν· ∇xϕ. Thus, in combination with the weak*
convergence of (ρν)νand (3.10), we may conclude ∂tfν
ϕ→∂tfϕinL1(0,T). By an
Arzelà-Ascoli type argument, we deduce fν
ϕ→fϕuniformly in [0,T]. Due to the
density ofC∞
c(H)inLq′(H), it follows that
ρν→ρinC([0,T],Lq
w(R3)).
Step 4: Convergence of Lq-norms on bounded sets for1<q<∞

ϕwith respect to time we may
invoke (3.1) and (3.2). Note that bandbνhave zero swirl components and conse-
quently we can again swap b·∇ϕbyb·∇xϕand similarly for bν·∇ρν. We also use
thatρis renormalized:

uniformly in [0,T]. It also follows from ∂thφ∈L1(0,T)thatρ∈C([0,T];Lq(BR(0))),
as seen by a standard argument that uses an approximation of t he characteristic
function of BR(0)by functions in C∞
c.
Step 5: Local strong convergence in C([0,T],Lq
loc(R3)),1<q<∞
We only have to combine the results of Step 3 and Step 4. Indeed for any(tν)ν⊂
[0,T],tν→t, and any test function ϕ∈C∞
c(H), Step 3 reveals
/integraldisplay
R3ρν(tν,x)ϕ(x)dx→/integraldisplay

w(R3)). Likewise,
/integraldisplay
BR(0)|ρν(tν,x)|qdx→/integraldisplay
BR(0)|ρ(t,x)|qdx
for allR >0due to Step 4. As weak convergence and convergence of the norm s
jointly imply strong convergence, we know that ρν(tν)→ρ(t)inLq(BR(0)). This
now implies ρν→ρinLq(BR(0))uniformly on [0,T]: Indeed, if this were not the
case, then there would exist δ>0and a sequence tν→tof times such that
/ba∇dblρν(tν)−ρ(tν)/ba∇dblq>δ.
Sinceρν(tν)→ρ(t)and alsoρ(tν)→ρ(t)inLq(BR(0)), we obtain 0≥δ, a contra-
diction.

Proof of Theorem 3.1. ξν⇀∗ξinL∞((0,T),L˜p(R3))for all˜p∈(1,p]. Now, follow-

whereψnis a standard molliﬁer. Recall that uνanduare obtained from ξνandξ
through the Biot-Savart law. Note that we again used the cyli ndrical symmetry to
give a formulation in the halfplane H. By means of the triangle inequality, it then
follows that

where˜gν

to deduce that, for ﬁxed n, the ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side of (3.25) tends to
zero uniformly in ν <ν0, whereν0=ν0(n)>0is suﬃciently small:

In [29, Lemma 1] it was noticed that ˜ξn=ξn−ξas a diﬀerence of renormalized

/braceleftBigg
∂t˜ξn+u·∇˜ξn= ˜gn
˜ξn(0,·) =ξn(0,·)−ξ0(3.27)
in the renormalized sense, where ˜gn=g∗ψn−gand˜ξn,0=ξn,0−ξ0. As a
consequence, for ﬁxed n, the third term of (3.25) converges to zero due to the
estimate
/ba∇dblξn−ξ/ba∇dblLp(R3)≤C(p)/parenleftbig
/ba∇dblξn(0,·)−ξ0/ba∇dblLp(R3)+/ba∇dblg∗ψn−g/ba∇dblL1((0,T),Lp(R3))/parenrightbig
.REFERENCES 15
For the remaining term we apply Lemma 3.2. Because of the regu larization of
the initial data we obtain ξν
n(0,·)→ξn(0,·)inL1(R3)andξνkn(0,·)⇀∗ξn(0,·)in
L∞(R3)asν→0. Indeed the latter weak∗convergence is true for any ﬁxed nsince

q= 1. Further, we decompose the axisymmetric Biot-Savart law as
u1= (1B1(0)G)∗ω, u 2= (1B1(0)cG)∗ω,
where it should be carefully noted that here, B1(0)denotes the unit ball in R2.
We getu=u1+u2∈L∞((0,T),L1+L∞(H))and(uν)νis bounded in L∞((0,T),L1+
L∞(H)). Indeed, from [14, (2.11)] we know that the Biot-Savart kern el (expressed
in cylindrical coordinates) satisﬁes |G|/lessorsimilar1
|·|. It then follows by Young’s inequality
that
/ba∇dblu1/ba∇dblL1(H)+/ba∇dblu2/ba∇dblL∞(H)/lessorsimilar/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble1B1(0)1

For the same reason we have

2/ba∇dblL∞(H)≤ /ba∇dblξν

Furthermore by Theorem 2.7 we have
uν→uinL2((0,T),L2
loc(R3)).
Eventually, by imposing ([28, Lemma 4]) it follows u∈L1((0,T),W1,1
loc(R3)). Now,
for any ﬁxed nall conditions of Lemma 3.2 are met. Hence, the second term
of (3.25) becomes arbitrarily small if we choose nsuﬃciently large and then ν=
ν(n)suﬃciently small. /square
