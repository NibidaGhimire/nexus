ABSTRACT
Galaxy peculiar velocities can be used to trace the growth of structure on cosmological scales. In the
radial direction, peculiar velocities cause redshift space distortions, an established cosmological probe, and
can be measured individually in the presence of an independent distance indicator. In the transverse direction,
peculiar velocities cause proper motions. In this case, however, the proper motions are too small to detect on a
galaxy-by-galaxy basis for any realistic experiment in the foreseeable future, but could be detected statistically
in cross-correlation with other tracers of the density fluctuations. We forecast the sensitivity for a detection of
transverse peculiar velocities through the cross-correlation of a proper motion survey, modelled after existing
extragalactic samples measured by Gaia , and an overlaping galaxy survey. In particular, we consider a low-
redshift galaxy sample, and a higher-redshift quasar sample. We find that, while the expected cosmological
signal is below the expected statistical uncertainties from current data using cross-correlations, the sensitivity
can improve fast with future experiments, and the threshold for detection may not be too far away in the future.
Quantitatively, we find that the signal-to-noise ratio for detection is in the range 𝑆/𝑁∼0.3, with most of
the signal concentrated at low redshifts 𝑧≲0.3. If detected, this signal is sensitive to the product of the
expansion and growth rates at late times, and thus would constitute an independent observable, sensitive to both
background expansion and large-scale density fluctuations.
1.INTRODUCTION
Cosmology, perhaps more than any other physical science,
suffers from lack of direct dimensional measurements. The
majority of our data relies on angular positions, redshifts,
and relative fluctuations. A small number of notable ex-
amples include the CMB temperature (Fixsen 2009), direct
measurements of the Hubble parameter through distance lad-
der (Riess etal. 2022), and strong lensing time delays (Birrer
etal. 2022). Recent advances in precision spectroscopy and as-
trometry can open new avenues for measuring cosmologically-
induced changes in redshift and position of objects on the sky
(Chakrabarti etal. 2022). Both measurements are related to
time derivatives of cosmological quantities, and would thus
be directly sensitive to the Universe’s master clock rate, the
Hubble parameter 𝐻0. Since tensions in the measurements of
the Hubble parameter are currently one of the main challenges
for the standard ΛCDM cosmological model, exploring other
observables sensitive to the expansion rate is of high priority.
In this paper we investigate the possibility of detecting the
transverse peculiar velocity field by measuring the correlated
angular proper motions of galaxies, in particular considering
their cross-correlation with other tracers of the cosmic density
fluctuations, such as galaxy surveys. Physically, as the Uni-
verse evolves, the density contrast increases and matter flows
towards over-dense regions. We therefore expect galaxy trans-
verse peculiar velocities to preferably orient towards nearby
over-densities. Statistically, this manifests itself as a non-zero
correlation between the 𝐸-mode (i.e. the pure gradient compo-
∗iain.duncan@sjc.ox.ac.uknent) of the proper motion field, and the galaxy overdensities.
This constitutes the main observable we will consider here.
As we will show, the corresponding signal is sensitive to the
combination
𝐻 𝑓 𝜎 8, (1)
where𝐻is the Hubble parameter (i.e. the background ex-
pansion rate, with present value 𝐻0), the growth rate 𝑓≡
𝑑log𝛿/𝑑log𝑎is the logarithmic derivative of matter overden-
sities𝛿with respect to the scale factor 𝑎in the linear regime,
and𝜎8is the rms fluctuation of the density field in spheres of
radius𝑅=8 Mpc/ℎ, withℎ≡𝐻0/(100 km/s/Mpc). Thus,
besides offering us an independent measurement of the expan-
sion rate, correlated proper motions are also sensitive to the
growth and amplitude of matter perturbations. This addresses
the so-called “ 𝑆8tension” between measurements of the am-
plitude of inhomogeneities carried out by CMB and galaxy
weak lensing experiments (Hikage etal. 2019; Abbott etal.
2022; Amon etal. 2022; Secco etal. 2022; van den Busch
etal. 2022; Planck Collaboration etal. 2016; Krolewski etal.
2021; Abbott etal. 2023; Heymans etal. 2021; Garc ´ıa-Garc ´ıa
etal. 2021), another significant challenge for ΛCDM.
A galaxy at𝑧∼0.1 moving across the sky at a typical trans-
verse velocity of 300 km /s would cover an angle 𝛼∼2𝜇as
in 10 years of observation. With typical proper-motion uncer-
tainties of at least 𝑂(100)𝜇as yr−1after a similar observation
period, this signal is impossible to detect on a galaxy-by-
galaxy basis. Measurements of the proper motion field caused
by cosmological peculiar velocities will therefore be invari-
ably noise-dominated. In terms of detectability, it is generallyarXiv:2305.15893v2  [astro-ph.CO]  1 Feb 20242
advantageous to correlate a noisy dataset with a high signal-
to-noise tracer. For example, cross-correlations formed the
basis of the first detection of CMB lensing (Smith etal. 2007),
all existing measurements of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe ef-
fect (Fosalba etal. 2003; Francis and Peacock 2010; Barreiro
etal. 2013; Ferraro etal. 2015; Krolewski and Ferraro 2022;
Shajib and Wright 2016), and all evidence for the cluster-
ing of damped Lyman- 𝛼systems (Font-Ribera etal. 2012;
P´erez-R `afols etal. 2018; Alonso etal. 2018). While detecting
transverse galaxy peculiar motions has long been considered
to be unfeasible, we will show that Gaia (Gaia Collaboration
etal. 2016), the European Space Agency’s flagship astromet-
ric mission, may come close in raw sensitivity to the detection
threshold when combined with a sufficiently dense galaxy sur-
vey at low redshifts (where amplitude of the proper motion
signal peaks). This could thus be transformed into a high-
significance detection with a future, more sensitive mission,
unlocking a new probe of structure growth in the low-redshift
Universe.
Previous literature has studied different approaches to cos-
mological proper motions. Hall (2019) has focused on the
secular parallax due to the Solar System’s motion relative to
distant objects (see also Darling 2013). Darling and Trueben-
bach (2018) have investigated the configuration-space corre-
lation of galaxy proper motions and forecasted the sensitiv-
ity of the auto-correlation measurements with results that are
broadly consistent with ours for that observable.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we develop
the mathematical background needed to quantify the expected
cosmological signal from peculiar motion measurements, its
statistical uncertainties, and its detectability for different exper-
imental configurations. Section 3 briefly discusses the model
used to describe a generic proper motion experiment based
on the current performance of Gaia . Our results concerning
the detectability of this signal are presented in Section 4, and
summarised in Section 5.
2.THEORY
2.1.Proper motions and peculiar velocities
Letˆnbe the unit vector pointing in the direction of a given
source. The observable we aim to study here is the measured
transverse peculiar motion, defined as
¤𝜶≡𝑑ˆn
𝑑𝑡𝑜, (2)
where𝑡𝑜is the time measured at the observer’s position. Our
theoretical description for this observable follows and builds
upon the derivation of Hall (2019), focusing on the projected
(angular) statistics of the transverse velocity field, and deriv-
ing a prediction for its angular power spectrum and cross-
correlation with galaxies. Ignoring general-relativistic cor-
rections – since they are generally small (Alonso and Ferreira
2015), and the comoving distances we are most sensitive to are
smaller than the horizon – time intervals at the observer and
the emitter are related via 𝑑𝑡𝑜=(1+𝑧)𝑑𝑡, where𝑡is the time
measured at the emitter’s rest frame. Writing ˆnin terms of
the source’s comoving coordinates xasˆn≡x/𝜒, where𝜒is
the radial comoving distance, we can relate ¤𝜶to the transverse
comoving velocity v⊥≡(1−ˆn𝑇ˆn)·v=¤x−ˆn¤𝜒, to obtain the
intuitive result
¤𝜶=v⊥
(1+𝑧)𝜒. (3)
After measuring¤𝜶at the position of several objects, we cannow make maps of the projected peculiar motion, by averaging
over the values of¤𝜶for all galaxies lying on each pixel. Let
us call the resulting map ¤A, and let𝑝(𝑧)be the distribution
of source redshifts. The value of ¤Ameasured along the pixel
centered around position ˆnis then
¤A(ˆn)=∫
𝑑𝑧𝑝(𝑧)¤𝜶(𝜒ˆn). (4)
Neglecting vorticity modes (which are heavily suppressed
on large scales), the comoving peculiar velocity field can be
written in terms of velocity potential v=∇𝜑𝑣.¤Acan therefore
be expressed as the angular gradient 1of an effective projected
potentialΦ𝑣, given by
Φ𝑣(ˆn)=∫
𝑑𝑧𝑝(𝑧)
𝜒2(1+𝑧)𝜑𝑣(𝜒ˆn). (5)
The two components of the projected velocity map can then
be combined into a complex spin-1 field ¤𝐴≡¤𝐴1+𝑖¤𝐴2, which
is related toΦ𝑣through the differential spin-raising operator
ð(Goldberg etal. 1967) as
¤𝐴=−ðΦ𝑣. (6)
Since¤𝐴is a pure gradient, it is also a pure 𝐸-mode field (i.e.
its𝐵-mode component should be zero). In practice, a 𝐵-mode
component would be generated by any vortical contribution
tov(e.g. due to non-linear gravitational collapse), or by
source clustering effects in the ¤Amap (for weak gravitational
effect lensing equivalent see Schneider etal. (2002)), both of
which are higher-order effects in perturbation theory, and thus
negligible given the statistical uncertainties of this observable
(see Appendix A). The spherical harmonic coefficients of the
𝐸-mode component of ¤𝐴are then simply related to those of
Φ𝑣via
¤𝐴𝐸
ℓ𝑚=√︁
ℓ(ℓ+1)Φ𝑣,ℓ𝑚. (7)
In order to relate the peculiar velocity potential to the matter
overdensity𝛿, we make use of the linear continuity equation
(¤𝛿+∇· v=0), which in Fourier space reads
𝜑𝑣(k)=𝐻𝑓
𝑘2𝛿(k). (8)
Here𝑓≡𝑑log𝛿/𝑑log𝑎is the growth rate of structure, with
𝑎the scale factor, 𝐻≡ ¤𝑎/𝑎is the expansion rate, and we
have assumed self-similar growth (valid in the linear regime
inΛCDM). Thus we see that the peculiar velocity field is
sensitive to the combination 𝐻 𝑓, as well as the amplitude
of the matter overdensity 𝛿, commonly parametrised in terms
of𝜎8(the standard deviation of 𝛿on spheres of comoving
radius𝑅=8ℎ−1Mpc). As we will see, the scales over which
the transverse peculiar motion field can be detected are rather
large, and the linear approximation above should be sufficiently
accurate. We leave a more thorough study of the impact
of various non-linear effects (including the generation of 𝐵-
modes) for future work.
Before we move on to calculate the cross-correlation be-
tween proper motion maps and the galaxy overdensity, it is
worth noting that a variation in the angular positions of distant
sources may also be caused via gravitational lensing by time-
varying gravitational potentials. As we show in Appendix A,
1The angular gradient ∇𝜃is related to the transverse gradient ∇⊥via
∇⊥=𝜒−1∇𝜃.3
however, the signal is only sourced at low redshifts and is al-
ways at least one order of magnitude lower than the peculiar
velocity contribution.
2.2.Galaxy overdensity
The second observable we will use in this work is the pro-
jected galaxy overdensity Δ𝑔, given in terms of the 3D over-
density𝛿𝑔as
Δ𝑔(ˆn)≡∫
𝑑𝑧𝑝(𝑧)𝛿𝑔(𝜒ˆn), (9)
where𝑝(𝑧)is the redshift distribution of the sample under
study. We will use a simple linear bias relation to relate the
galaxy and matter overdensities:
𝛿𝑔=𝑏𝑔𝛿. (10)
On the large scales over which the peculiar motion signal can
be detected this should be sufficiently accurate (Nicola etal.
2023).
2.3.Angular power spectra
Consider now a projected velocity map constructed from a
galaxy sample with redshift distribution 𝑝𝐴(𝑧), and a separate
galaxy sample with distribution 𝑝𝑔(𝑧), from which we con-
struct a map of the projected overdensity field. The angular
power spectrum 𝐶ℓis defined to be the co-variance between
the harmonic coefficients of any pair of such maps:
⟨𝑎ℓ𝑚𝑏ℓ′𝑚′⟩≡𝐶𝑎𝑏
ℓ𝛿ℓℓ′𝛿𝑚𝑚′. (11)
Using the results from the two preceding sections, we can
relate the power spectra of the projected galaxy overdensity
and the peculiar velocity 𝐸-mode to the matter power spectrum

Here,𝑑𝑧/𝑑𝜒=𝐻(𝑧), and𝑗ℓ(𝑘𝜒)is the order- ℓspherical
Bessel function 2. The functional form of the transfer functions
is determined by the projection kernels associated with the
two quantities under study (see Eq. 5 and Eq. 9). The factor√︁
ℓ(ℓ+1)originates from the angular derivative in Eq. 6 (see
Eq. 7).
If the kernels under study are sufficiently broad, the compu-
tation of Eq. 12 can be accelerated through the use of Limber’s
approximation (Limber 1953; Kaiser 1992). Note, however,
that we will not make use of this approximation in any of
the calculations presented here. Since galaxy peculiar veloc-
ities are uncorrelated at large distances, averaging the proper
motion of galaxies over large radial separations would wash
out the signal, and thus this probe benefits from using narrow
2Note that we use natural units with the speed of light 𝑐=1.redshift bins, for which Limber’s approximation is not appro-
priate. This also implies that a practical application of this
probe would benefit from a fully three-dimensional treatment,
where the transverse velocity and galaxy overdensity fields are
reconstructed and correlated in 3D. We leave the development
of this formalism (which would follow closely the 3D treat-
ment of intrinsic alignments described in Shi etal. (2021)) for
future work.
2.4.Noise model
To forecast the detectability of the cosmic transverse velocity
signal we need to quantify the noise properties of the projected
proper motion and galaxy overdensity maps.
The only source of noise for Δ𝑔is Poisson noise due to the
discrete number of sources. The corresponding noise power
spectrum is
𝑁𝑔𝑔
ℓ=1
¯𝑛𝑔, (15)
where ¯𝑛𝑔is the angular number density of galaxies in the
sample, in units of srad−1.
The peculiar motion map is constructed by averaging, in
each pixel, the peculiar motion vector ¤𝜶of each galaxy in the
pixel (the map is therefore, in fact, two maps, one for each
component). The noise power spectrum of the 𝐸-mode of the
resulting map is then given by
𝑁𝐴𝐴
ℓ=𝜎2
pm
¯𝑛𝐴, (16)
where ¯𝑛𝐴is the number density of sources with measured
peculiar motions, and 𝜎pmis the root mean square error in the
measurement of each component of ¤𝜶for a given galaxy.
To estimate𝜎pm, consider observations of the position xof
a given source at various times: {x𝑛≡x(𝑡𝑛), 𝑛∈[1,𝑁]},
where𝑁is the total number of visits. The apparent peculiar
motion of this object, ¤𝜶, can be measured by modelling it as:
𝑥𝑖,𝑛=¤𝛼𝑖𝑡𝑛+𝑛𝑖,𝑛, (17)
where the index 𝑖runs over the two sky coordinates, and 𝑛𝑖,𝑛
is random noise caused by astrometric uncertainties. The
value of¤𝛼𝑖can be estimated from these measurements using
linear regression, under the assumption that the noise 𝑛𝑖,𝑛is
Gaussianly distributed with standard deviation 𝜎𝑥,𝑛. In this
case, the per-component uncertainty on ¤𝜶is given by
𝜎2
pm="𝑁∑︁
𝑛=1𝑡2
𝑛
𝜎2𝑥,𝑛#−1
. (18)
For simplicity, let us assume periodic visits, so 𝑡𝑛=𝑛𝑇/𝑁,
where𝑇is the total observing time, and that the astrometry
uncertainty is constant 𝜎𝑥,𝑛=𝜎𝑥. The proper motion variance
then reads
𝜎2
pm=𝜎2
𝑥𝑁2
𝑇21Í
𝑛𝑛2. (19)
UsingÍ𝑁
𝑛=1𝑛2=𝑁(𝑁+1)(2𝑁+1)/6≃𝑁3/3 in the large- 𝑁
limit, we obtain:
𝜎pm=√
3𝜎𝑥
𝑇√
𝑁. (20)
Assuming a constant cadence ( 𝑁∝𝑇), the peculiar motion
uncertainties thus decrease with survey time as
𝜎pm∝𝑇−3/2. (21)4
This is significantly faster than the usual ∝√
𝑇scaling of
mapping experiments. It implies that an order of magnitude
improvement in the map-level noise rms can be achieved by
reducing astrometry errors by a similar factor, or by increasing
the total observation time only by a factor ∼4.6.
2.5.Forecasting detectability
We quantify the significance with which the peculiar motion
signal can be detected as the square root of the Fisher matrix
element for an effective amplitude parameter, with fiducial
value 1, multiplying the signal component of the peculiar mo-
tion map¤𝐴(ˆn). For the cross-correlation between ¤𝐴and a
galaxy overdensity map, the signal-to-noise ratio is
𝑆
𝑁2
𝑔𝐴=ℓmax∑︁

The cross-correlation is therefore likely to achieve signifi-
cantly better 𝑆/𝑁ratio than the auto-correlation if the peculiar
motion map is noise-dominated. This is because, in this case,
the cross-correlation 𝑆/𝑁scales as(𝑁𝐴𝐴
ℓ)−1/2∝𝜎−1
pm∝𝑇3/2,
instead of(𝑁𝐴𝐴
ℓ)−1∝𝜎−2
pm∝𝑇3for the auto-correlation.
3.PROPER MOTION SURVEYS
To model a generic astrometric survey that could potentially
measure the cosmic proper motion signal, we use data from
theGaia DR3 data release 3(Gaia Collaboration etal. 2022a).
This data release corresponds to about 34 months of data col-
lection. We focus on the two main extragalactic source types
made available with the release, galaxies and quasars; the par-
ent samples are detailed in Gaia Collaboration etal. (2022b).
These sources have proper motion and redshift information,
and cover the entire sky (besides the galactic plane). Our main
use of this data is to model the distribution of errors in our
forecasting exercise. The specific samples we use are:
•Low-redshift galaxies: Gaia DR3 contains a sample
of∼1.4×106galaxies at𝑧≲0.4, of which∼3.7×105
have proper motion measurements and redshift esti-
mates. Given the extended nature and lower surface
brightness of galaxies, compared to the quasar sample,
the proper motion uncertainties of this sample are signif-
icantly higher, ranging from ∼500 to∼1400𝜇as yr−1.
However, the angle covered by a galaxy moving at a
fixed transverse velocity scales as 𝜒−1with radial dis-
tance, and thus the amplitude of the proper motion sig-
nal grows quickly towards 𝑧=0, compensating for the
comparably larger measurement noise.
•High-redshift quasars: Gaia DR3 contains millions
of quasar candidates. This parent sample has very low
purity, containing many stellar contaminants, so we use
the clean Gaia -unWISE quasar catalog derived from it
by Storey-Fisher et al. (in prep.). This contains ∼1.3×
3https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr3106quasars with Gaia𝐺-band magnitude less than 20.5,
and also has improved redshift estimates which span the
redshift range 𝑧≲4. Given the almost point-source
nature of quasars, they constitute an ideal extragalactic
sample for proper motion measurements. Typical proper
motion uncertainties for this sample range from ∼150
to∼350𝜇as yr−1. A primary use for quasar proper
motions is to calibrate the motion of Milky Way stars in
the same sky patch. Instead, here we will use this sample
as a potential tracer of the transverse velocity field. The
calibration of the quasar proper motions themselves is a
challenging problem that we will not explore here.
Fig. 1 shows the redshift distribution and typical proper mo-
tion uncertainties of both samples. It is worth noting proper
motion uncertainties vary significantly from one object to an-
other (the shaded bands in the figure show the standard devia-
tion of𝜎pm). Thus, our estimate of the map-level noise in each
redshift bin will assume that the proper motion map has been
constructed by averaging over sources using inverse-variance
weighting:
¯𝜎−2
pm=1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝜎−2
pm,𝑖, (24)
where the index 𝑖runs over the 𝑁sources in the redshift bin.
This estimate of the map-level noise is shown as a solid line
in the figure, in contrast with the mean rms error, shown as a
dotted line.
These parameters (number of galaxies, distribution in red-
shift, and proper motion errors) will characterise the fiducial
setup explored in the next section. In all cases we will also
explore improved versions of this fiducial (e.g. with a larger
number of sources, lower proper motion errors, or longer ob-
servation times).
4.RESULTS
We combine the methods described above to forecast the
signal-to-noise of different samples. We will treat the galaxy
and quasar catalogs of Gaia DR3 as our fiducial setup, defined
by the redshift distribution and proper motion errors shown
in the two top rows of Fig. 1, and the sample sizes quoted in
Section 3. Unless otherwise stated, we will consider only the
cross-correlation between proper motion maps and a sample
of galaxies. The latter will, by default, be assumed to be
unaffected by shot noise (i.e. we will report results in the limit
¯𝑛𝑔→∞ ), and we will explore the impact of shot noise in
Section 4.4.
To produce our forecasts we will divide the Gaia DR3 galaxy
and quasar samples into top-hat redshift bins with constant
width𝛿𝑧=0.04. This leads to 10 bins in the range 𝑧 <0.4
for the galaxy sample, and 100 bins in the range 𝑧 <4 for the
quasar sample. We note that the forecast of the signal-to-noise
ratio𝑆/𝑁is somewhat sensitive to this choice, emphasizing
that a practical analysis of proper motion cross-correlations
should be carried out using a fully three-dimensional formal-
ism. Nevertheless, we find that the results presented here
change by less than 10% when doubling the number of bins.
We deem this level of precision to be accurate enough for
our forecasts, given the large uncertainties in other aspects of
this analysis (e.g. the impact of large-scale systematics in the
proper motion maps).
By default, in all cases we will report forecast signal-to-
noise ratios using only multipoles ℓ>2. Note that the peculiar5

density that shot noise can be ignored.
motion signal should have a non-zero dipole ( ℓ=1). Reliably
measuring this dipole, is likely challenging (Hall 2019), and
hence we focus on the higher multipoles. We will quantify the
improvement in expected 𝑆/𝑁when including the ℓ=1 mode
in Section 4.3.
4.1.Forecasts for the fiducial Gaia samples
The lower panels of Fig. 1 show the cumulative signal to
noise ratio for each of the two samples as a function of the max-
imum redshift included in the analysis. Results are shown for
the cross-correlation with a dense low-redshift sample as solid
lines, and for the proper motion auto-correlation as dashed
lines. Note the multiplicative factors of 10 and 100 applied to
the auto-correlation result in order to show both lines on the
same scale.
Several important conclusions can be derived from this fig-
ure. First, the signal is dominated by sources at low redshifts
(𝑧≲0.1 for the galaxy sample, and 𝑧≲0.5 for the quasar
sample). This is to be expected, given the inverse scaling
of proper motions induced by peculiar velocities with radial
distance (Eq. 3). Secondly, in spite of its significantly larger
measurement uncertainties 𝜎pm, the galaxy sample achieves
a𝑆/𝑁that is twice that of the quasar sample. This is be-
cause the larger measurement noise is compensated by thesignificantly higher number density concentrated at low red-
shifts for the galaxy sample. Thirdly, the signal-to-noise of the
auto-correlation is orders of magnitude smaller than the cross-
correlation in all cases. As we discussed in Section 2.5, this
is to be expected given the milder scaling with measurement
error of the cross-correlation in the noise-dominated regime.
Finally, integrating over the full redshift range, we conclude
that the current Gaia samples should be able to “detect” the
cosmological proper motion signal (as predicted by ΛCDM)
with a signal-to-noise ratio
𝑆

for the galaxy and quasar sample respectively. The current
data sets are not sensitive enough for a convincing detection
(𝑆/𝑁∼5) of this proper motion signal. However, the sensi-
tivity that is forecast to achieve this goal is only a factor ∼10
(as opposed to several orders of magnitude) smaller than the
rough detection limit, and thus it is not far-fetched to imagine
a future experiment improving on the sensitivity of Gaia that
could make such measurement.

sources than the current Gaia catalogs, with 1 <𝑅𝑛<10. Results are shown
in red and black for the Gaia galaxy and quasar samples, respectively. The
upper𝑥axis shows the equivalent factor by which the observing time of Gaia
would need to be increased to achieve a similar precision.
Since existing datasets may not be that far from detecting
the cosmological proper motion signal, the aim of this sec-
tion is to forecast the improvement in sensitivity that would
be needed in order to make this detection with a future ex-
periment. As we discussed in Section 2.4, the proper motion
noise can be reduced by reducing the astrometric uncertain-
ties (𝑁𝐴𝐴
ℓ∝𝜎2
pm∝𝜎2
𝑥), increasing the observation time
(𝑁𝐴𝐴
ℓ∝𝜎2
pm∝𝑇−3), or increasing the number of sources
with measured proper motions ( 𝑁𝐴𝐴
ℓ∝¯𝑛−1
𝐴).
Figure 2 shows the signal-to-noise ratio of a hypothetical
experiment as a function of the factor 𝑅𝜎by which proper
motion uncertainties have improved with respect to Gaia . I.e.
𝑅𝜎≡𝜎pm,𝐺𝑎𝑖𝑎
𝜎pm. (26)
We consider samples based on the Gaia galaxy and quasar
catalogs, shown in red and black respectively. The two shaded
bands show the range of 𝑆/𝑁that would be achieved by in-
creasing the number of sources in the samples by a factor 𝑅𝑛,
with𝑅𝑛=1 (i.e. current size) corresponding to the lower
bound, and𝑅𝑛=10 corresponding to the upper bound. The
upper𝑥-axis shows the factor by which the observation time
ofGaia would need to be extended, keeping astrometric errors
constant, to achieve a given 𝑅𝜎.
We find that current samples could achieve 𝑆/𝑁∼1 by
either increasing the sample size by a factor ∼10, or improving
proper motion measurement sensitivities by a factor 𝑅𝜎∼4
(corresponding to a factor ∼2.5 increase in observation time
with respect to Gaia ). Reaching 𝑆/𝑁=5 (marked by a
horizontal blue dotted line in the figure) may require a factor ∼
6 increase in observation time ( 𝑅𝜎∼15), or a∼3 times larger
observation time accompanied by a 10-fold increase in sample
size. The sensitivity of the quasar sample remains lower than
that of the galaxy sample, except in the high-sensitivity regime
(𝑅𝜎∼70,𝑅𝑛=10), where the galaxy sample becomes

in observation time) with the auto-correlation. In the cosmic-
variance-limited regime ( 𝑅𝜎≳100), the auto- and cross-
correlations achieve comparable sensitivities.
4.3.Sensitivity as a function of scale
Since measurements of the proper motion signal on large
scales are likely affected by various systematics, it is worth
quantifying the detectability of this signal as a function of
the range of angular scales included in the analysis. Figure 3
shows the fraction of the total signal to noise (labelled 𝑅𝑆/𝑁)
as a function of the minimum and maximum multipoles used
(top and bottom panels respectively). For the Gaia galaxy
sample, shown in red, we find that ∼90% of the signal is
concentrated on scales ℓ≲25, and that a measurement of the
quadrupole ( ℓ=2) would achieve approximately half of the
total signal-to-noise ratio. The quasar sample, on the other
hand, has a milder dependence on scale, and ∼50% of the
sensitivity can still be recovered with scales ℓ≳50. This is
due to the higher effective redshift of the sample, which pushes
part of the signal to larger multipoles.
As we discussed above, we have so far ignored the infor-
mation encoded in the dipole ( ℓ=1). However, given the
steep scale dependence observed in Fig. 3, we can expect
the dipole to have a non-negligible constribution to the total
sensitivity. We find that including the ℓ=1 mode leads to
improved sensitivities by a factor

The dipole is therefore particularly important for the low-

tal signal-to-noise ratio. It would be therefore imperative in
any attempt to measure the cosmic proper motion signal from
low-redshift samples, to conduct a thorough study of the dom-
inant systematics affecting proper motion measurements on
the largest angular scales. For a higher-redshift sample, in
turn, the dipole contribution is significantly smaller, and such
a sample would rely less on the precision with which large-
scale systematics in proper motion measurements can be kept
under control.
4.4.The impact of shot noise and bias
So far we have assumed that the galaxy sample used to cross-
correlate the proper motion maps with is cosmic-variance
limited (i.e. ¯ 𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑔
ℓ𝑔≫1 for all relevant scales). This is
not an unreasonable approximation, as no measurement of the
proper motions of this sample is needed, and thus any sample
of galaxies covering the same redshift range can be used for
this purpose. In general, when a galaxy survey is not shot-
noise limited, the sensitivity improves as a function of bias
weighted number density ¯ 𝑛. Figure 4 quantifies the impact of
this assumption for the Gaia galaxy and quasar samples. In
the figure, we calculate the 𝑆/𝑁for the proper motion cross-
correlation against a catalog of galaxies following the same
redshift distribution as the proper motion sample, but contain-
ing a factor𝑅𝑔higher ¯𝑛𝑏(the noiseless limit is achieved in the
limit𝑅𝑔→∞ ). We find that the Gaia galaxy sample is al-
ready close to cosmic-variance limited on the relevant scales.
This is not surprising since, as we saw in the previous section,
the signal in this case is concentrated on very large angular
scales.
In turn, the quasar catalog, covering a much larger volume, is
significantly sparser, and its sensitivity benefits from a denser
sample to cross-correlate with, up to 𝑅𝑔∼100. Although this
is unrealistic, given the large volume covered by the quasar
sample, it is worth noting that this significant increase in den-
sity is only necessary over the redshift range 𝑧≲0.5, where
the signal is concentrated (see the bottom right panel of Fig.
1). Only∼75,000 of the Gaia quasars lie at these low red-
shifts, and thus, for 𝑅𝑔=100, one only requires a catalog
containing∼7.5×106objects below 𝑧=0.5. Such catalogs
are already available (e.g. the WISE ×SuperCOSMOS pho-

tometric sample of Bilicki etal. (2016), or the DESI Legacy
Survey (Dey etal. 2019), covering a smaller sky fraction).
We thus conclude that the size of the galaxy sample used to
cross-correlate with is not an obstacle for the detection of this
signal.
So far we have adopted a fiducial value of the galaxy bias
𝑏𝑔=1. The value of 𝑏𝑔however depends on the sample
under study. Generally denser samples tend to have lower
biases, so for the high-density Gaia sample assumed here,
𝑏𝑔≃1 is likely reasonable. Quasars, however, populate
significantly higher-mass halos, and thus have biases in the
range𝑏𝑔∼ (2,4)(Laurent etal. 2017). The 𝑆/𝑁for the
cross-correlation measurement is sensitive to the galaxy bias,
especially in the shot-noise-dominated regime (see Eq. 22),
and thus this assumption could affect the forecast 𝑆/𝑁.
In Figure 5, we calculate the 𝑆/𝑁for for the proper motion
cross-correlation against a catalog of galaxies following the
same redshift distribution as the proper motion sample, with
a bias parameter 0 .6< 𝑏𝑔<3. This process was repeated
for the Gaia galaxy sample and the quasar sample with and
without shot-noise. The values shown in the figure correspond
to the fractional improvement on 𝑆/𝑁for the case with 𝑏𝑔=1,
for each of these samples. We find that the results for the
quasar sample vary strongly with 𝑏𝑔, when it is not cross-
correlated by a higher-density sample, reaching 1 .8×𝑆/𝑁at
𝑏𝑔=3. However, when the quasar sample is cross-correlated
with a large enough sample (for which, as we mentioned, data
already exists), the dependence on 𝑏𝑔is significantly smaller,
varying by 5% of the fiducial 𝑆/𝑁across the range of 𝑏𝑔.
This variation is comparable to the dependence of the galaxy
measurement on 𝑏𝑔. We therefore expect the results presented
in the previous sections to be largely insensitive to our choice
of𝑏𝑔.
5.CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have studied detectability of cosmic proper
motions by Gaia as an example of the current generation of
proper-motion surveys. The main observable is the time vari-
ation in the angular position of extragalactic sources caused by
their peculiar velocities, and therefore sensitive to the growth
of structure. We find, that the best approach towards detecting8
the cosmic proper motions is though cross-correlation with
galaxy surveys, which are, especially at low redshift, mostly
already nearly sample variance limited.
We find that, against a na ¨ıve expectation, based on the ampli-
tude of this signal for individual objects, the cumulative signal-
to-noise with Gaia is not too far from unity, with the galaxy
and quasar samples achieving 𝑆/𝑁∼0.3 and∼0.15 respec-
tively. Galaxies have noisier proper motion measurements, but
they have considerably higher density at low redshifts, where
the proper motions are larger for the same velocity field. The
results can be brought above 𝑆/𝑁=1 by either having more
galaxies or integrating for longer. We reiterate that proper mo-
tions, like measuring the real-time expansion of the universe,
have a very favourable error scaling with observation time of
𝑇3/2, since the total motion of an object on the sky grows lin-
early with time, while the error drops as inverse root of time.
We find that a survey that has either ∼10 times as many sources
and integrates∼2.5 times longer, or that simply has ∼15 times
the precision of Gaia , could reach a detection of cosmological
peculiar motions with 𝑆/𝑁∼5. This can be compared with
the factor∼𝑂(100)improvement in the astrometric precision
ofGaia with respect to its precursor Hipparcos (Perryman
etal. 1997). In other words, next generation proper motion
surveys might be in position to achieve a detection. We cau-
tion that this assumes a full-sky survey and since the signal is
concentrated at low angular multipoles, a survey targeting a
smaller sky area, such as the Roman Space Telescope (Wenzl
etal. 2022), would not be appropriate.
While we find that the low-redshift galaxies are the most
promising tracer, their signal-to-noise is concentrated on larger
angular scales, which are more prone to systematic errors.
Therefore, quasars have their own advantages in terms of get-
ting the necessary signal-to-noise. In all cases, we find that the
shot noise of the galaxy sample against which the proper mo-
tion signal is cross-correlated, does not significantly affect its
detectability, and full-sky samples with the required number
density and survey depth are already available.
It must be noted, that the calibration of the proper motion
measurements is based on assuming distant quasars are at
rest with respect to the cosmological rest frame. This type
of calibration method would essentially null out any signalcoming from the lowest multipoles, with the detailed mode
loss depending on the precise calibration scheme. We find
that this will likely cause a significant, but not catastrophic,
loss of signal to noise by a factor of around 2 (albeit with large
uncertainties), unless alternative calibration strategies can be
devised.
Throughout this work we have assumed that all samples in-
volved have perfect redshift estimates. As we discussed in Sec-
tion 2, the amplitude of the proper motion signal is degraded if
projected over a broad redshift range, and thus redshift errors
could hamper a potential future detection. Additionally, and
for this reason, any attempt at detecting this signal would likely
benefit from a 3D treatment of the proper motion signal, as
opposed to the multi-bin “tomographic” approach described
here. Further insight may be gained from future releases of the
Gaia data, particularly if full spectral information is available
for extragalactic sources.
In addition to the basic confirmation of our cosmic paradigm
by observing the universe evolve in real time, cosmic proper
motions would be one of the few dimensional cosmological
numbers that we measure. This would directly tie the Hub-
ble expansion rates to our clocks, rather than indirectly via
other dimensional measurements (such as CMB temperature
and knowledge of fundamental physical constants). Therefore
it offers one of the few ways of clarifying the Hubble tension,
assuming it still exists when such measurements are finally
within instrumental sensitivity. In details, we are mostly sen-
sitive to the product of 𝐻𝑓𝑏𝜎 8, where𝑏is the galaxy bias.
The product of 𝑓𝑏𝜎 8can be measured for the given galaxy
sample by clustering and redshift-space distortions allowing
one to measure 𝐻0directly.

A.LENSING DRIFT
Gravitational lensing causes a displacement in the angular position of a source at comoving distance 𝜒𝑠, given by
𝜶𝐿=∇ˆn∫𝜒𝑠
0𝑑𝜒𝜒𝑠−𝜒
𝜒𝑠𝜒[𝜓+𝜙](𝜒ˆn,𝜂=𝜂0−𝜒), (A1)
where𝜓and𝜙are the Newtonian-gauge metric potentials, 𝜂is conformal time, and 𝜂0its the value of 𝜂at the observer. As the
gravitational potentials decay or grow, gravitational lensing causes a slow drift in 𝜶, which contributes to the overall apparent
proper motion of sources.
Differentiating with respect to 𝜂0(which coincides with the standard cosmic time 𝑡at𝑧=0), we obtain an expression for this
lensing-induced drift:
¤𝜶𝐿=∇ˆn∫𝜒𝑠
0𝑑𝜒𝜒𝑠−𝜒
𝜒𝑠𝜒𝜕𝜂[𝜓+𝜙]. (A2)
InΛCDM,𝜓=𝜙, and the Newtonian potential is related to the matter overdensity via the Poisson equation which, in Fourier
space, reads
𝜓(k)=−3
2𝐻2
0Ω𝑀𝛿(k)
𝑎𝑘2. (A3)
Assuming self-similar linear growth for 𝛿(valid in the linear regime), the time derivative of 𝜓+𝜙is then given by
𝜕𝜂(𝜙+𝜓)=𝑎𝐻(𝑓−1)(𝜙+𝜓). (A4)11

Fig. 6.— Angular power spectrum of the proper motion signal for a sample of galaxies at low redshifts ( 𝑧∼0.1, red), and at high redshifts ( 𝑧∼1, black). The
total power spectrum, including the intrinsic signal and the lensing drift contribution, is shown as solid lines, whereas the lensing drift component is shown as
dashed lines. The latter is subdominant in all cases, and hence likely undetectable.
Following the same steps outlined in Section 2.3, combined with the results above, the transfer function for the lensing drift
𝐸-mode is given by
𝑄𝐿
ℓ(𝑘,𝜒)=√︁

Two important conclusions can be gleaned from these results.
•First, unlike the contribution from lensing magnification to the observed galaxy overdensity, the lensing drift effect has the
same sign as the intrinsic proper motion. This is because, although lensing tends to displace observed positions away from
a foreground overdensity, the decaying nature of the gravitational potential at late times (i.e. 𝑓 < 1) causes the lensing
contribution to the apparent proper motion to point towards the overdensity.
•Second, although lensing is a cumulative effect, and thus source displacements are larger for higher-redshift sources,
the lensing drift effect is sourced by time-varying gravitational potentials, and thus only kicks in at late times, after the
matter-dominated era (e.g. as in the case of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect). The effect thus saturates at 𝑧∼1.
To estimate the lensing drift contribution to the proper motion signal we consider two configurations: a low-redshift sample
centered at𝑧=0.1, with a Gaussian redshift distribution of width 𝜎𝑧=0.05, and a high-redshift sample at 𝑧=1 with a width
𝜎𝑧=0.2. Figure 6 shows the angular power spectrum of the proper motion 𝐸-mode including both the intrinsic signal and the
lensing drift contribution, in solid black and red for the low-redshift and high-redshift samples respectively. The contribution from
lensing (including both the lensing drift auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with the intrinsic signal) is shown as dashed
lines for both cases. The lensing contribution is always subdominant and likely undetectable. Quantitatively, at low redshifts the
standard deviation of the intrinsic peculiar motion signal is ∼0.14𝜇as yr−1, while the lensing contribution is roughly three orders
of magnitude smaller. At higher redshifts, the lensing contribution can be up to ∼15% of the total signal, although the intrinsic
peculiar motion signal itself is more than 10 times smaller than at low redshifts.
