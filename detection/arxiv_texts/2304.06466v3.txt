ABSTRACT 
 
We describe how the market-based average and volatility of the “actual ” return, which the 
investors gain within their market sales, depend on the statistical moments, volatilities, and 
correlations of the current and past market trade values. We describe three successive 
approximations. First, we derive the dependence of the market-based average and volatility 
of a single sale return on market trade statistical moments determined by multiple purchases 
in the past. Then, we describe the dependence of average and volatility of return that a single 
investor gains during the “trading day. ” Finally, we derive the market-based average and 
volatility of return of different investors during the “trading day" as a function of volatilities 
and correlations of market trade values. That highlights the distribution of the “actual ” return 
of market trade and can serve as a benchmark for “purchasing ” investors.

The literature describes the two kinds of stock returns. For convenience, we note such returns 
as “anticipated ” and “actual ” returns. The most studied “anticipated ” return r(t,τ)  is 
determined by the ratio  r(t,τ)= p(t)/p(t- τ) of the stock price p(t) traded “today ” at time t and 
the price p(t-τ) traded at t-τ in the past. The “anticipated ” stock returns r(t,τ)  describe the 
expected, anticipat ed gains or losses that investors could get if they bought stocks at time t-τ 
in the past and then sold them at time t “today. ” Modeling and predictions of the 
“anticipated ” stock return at horizon T define the core issues of financial economics (Fisher 
and Lorie, 1964; Mandelbrot, Fisher, and Calvet, 1997; Campbell, 1985; Brown, 1989; Fama, 
1990; Fama and French, 1992; Lettau and Ludvigson, 2003; Greenwood and Shleifer, 2013; 
van Binsbergen and Koijen, 2015; Martin and Wagner, 2019). The description of the 
probabilistic properties of the “anticipa ted” stock return during any specific averaging time 
interval Δ “today, ” or, as we note, a “trading day, ” and predictions of the probability of return 
at horizon T “next day, ” deliver the most desired results for investors and traders. The 
frequency-based analysis of the return time series assesses the probability distributions of the 
“anticipated ” return during a “trading day ” (Amaral et al., 2000; Andersen et al., 2001; 
Knight and Satchell, 2001; Tsay, 2005; Andersen and Benzoni, 2009). 
However, the “anticipated ” stock return r(t,τ)=p(t)/p(t -τ) with the time shift τ describes the 
gains or losses that may or may not match the real, “actual ” return of investors. As “actual, ” 
we consider the return that a particular investor gains from selling the stocks at the time t, 
which he has purchased in 10 minutes, a day, a week, or any time in the past. Obvious ly, not 
all stocks that investors sell at time t “today ” were purchased at time t-τ in the past . Some 
stocks were purchased earlier or later than t-τ and at a price that differs from p(t-τ). Thus, 
investors who sell stocks at time t gain returns that are different from “anticipated ” returns, 
r(t,τ)=p(t)/p(t -τ). So, “anticipated ” returns r(t,τ) describe an option investors may gain, and 
“actual ” returns describe the benefits investors realize. During a “trading day, ” traders and 
investors sell stocks that were initially purchased at different times in the past. Investors sell 
stocks during the “trading day ” and gain returns on stocks they purchased in 10 minutes, a 
week, or any time in the past. To assess the average returns, or statistical moments of “actual ” 
returns, that investors gain, one should take into account returns with different time shifts. 
That differs “actual ” return from the description of the statistical properties of “anticipated ” 
return. Investigation of the “actual ” returns of institutional, professional, or individual 
investors forms a separate problem. Different aspects of “actual ” returns were studied by  3 (Schlarbaum, Lewellen and Lease, 1978; Stanley, Lewellen and Schlarbaum, 1980; Baker 
and Wurgler, 2 004; Ivković, Sialm  and Weisbenner, 2004;  Gabaix, et al 2005; Daniel and 
Hirshleifer, 2016; Koijen, Richmond and Yogo, 2020; Hardouvelis, Karalas and Vayanos, 
2021) and others. 
However, the statistical properties of “anticipated ” and “actual ” returns are mostly studied in 
the same way. To assess the probability P(r) of “anticipated ” or “actual ” returns during the 
time interval  Δ, one studies the time series of returns and assesses the frequency mr/N: 
𝑃(𝑟) ~ 𝑚𝑟
𝑁      (1.1) 
In (1.1), mr denotes the number of returns that equal r, and N is the total number of terms of 
the time series during Δ. That is the conventional assessment of the probability of any event, 
and analyzing its time series during Δ follows the basis of probability theory (Shephard, 
1991; Shiryaev, 1999; Shreve, 2004). For convenience, we further refer to such assessments 
(1.1) as the frequency-based probabilities of stock returns. It is regular and completely correct 
to assess the probability of return if the time series of return r(ti,τ) during the averaging 
interval Δ are considered independent, self-reliant variables. However, return at time ti is 
determined by stock price p(ti) at time ti and price p(ti-τ) at time ti-τ. Moreover, market trade 
values C(t i), volumes U(t i), and price p(ti) at time ti obey the primitive trade pricing equation 
(1.2): 
𝐶(𝑡𝑖)= 𝑝(𝑡𝑖)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)     (1.2) 
The equation (1.2) states that the statistical properties of trade value C(t i) and volume  U(t i) 
should determine the properties of price as a random variable during Δ. For convenience, in 
this paper, all prices are adjusted to the present time t. We consider market trade values, 
volumes, market prices, and returns as random variables during the selected time-averaging 
interval Δ. We believe that the consideration of market prices and stock returns as financial 
and economic matters should take into account the impact of the size of the trade values C(t i) 
and volumes U(t i) (1.2) on the average price, return, volatility, and statistics of returns. The 
well-known volume weighted average price (VWAP) (Berkowitz et al., 1988; Duffie and 
Dworczak, 2018), which differs from the frequency-based assessment of the mean price, 
demonstrates the impact of the size of trade volumes U(t i) on the average price. I t is 
reasonable that the statistical properties of the market trade values C(t i) and volumes U(t i) 
determine the statistic s of the market price, and in turn, the price statistics determine the 
statistics of stock return. The randomness of market trade determines the statistical moments 
of price and return, and that differs from the frequency-based probability assessments of the  4 price and return time series. We denote as market-based, the dependence of the statistical 
moments of return on the statistical moments and correlations of market trade values C(t i) 
and volumes U(t i) during the interval Δ. A description of the statistical moments of market 
prices and “anticipated ” stock returns that depend on the statistical moments and correlations 
of market trade values C(t i) and volumes U(t i) is given in Olkhov (2021-2023). We use these 
references to describe the market-based statistical moments of “actual ” return.  
Our paper describes the market-based statistical moments of the “actual ” returns of investors, 
which they gain during the averaging interval Δ that we denote a “trading day ”. We call all 
stocks that are sold by all investors during the averaging interval Δ a trading day portfolio. 
We derive the dependence of the statistical moments of the “actual ” return of investors on the 
statistical moments and correlations of market trade values C(t i) and volumes U(t i). In turn, 
the statistical moments of market trade values and volumes are assessed by the regular 
frequency-based (1.1) probability (Shephard, 1991; Shiryaev, 1999; Shreve, 2004). We 
consider statistical moments of return, which all investors gain from the sale of the trading 
day portfolio, as benchmarks for investors who purchase stock s during the same “trading 
day”. 
In this paper we reduce our description by the first two market-based statistical moments of 
“actual ” return and derive the dependence of average and volatility of return on statistical 
moments and correlations of market trade values and volumes for different cases.  
In Section 2, we describe the dependence of the market-based averages and the volatilities of  
price and the “anticipated ” stock return on statistical moments and correlations of the current 
and past trade values and volumes. In Section 3, we consider the dependence of mark et-based 
average and volatility of the “actual ” return of a single deal as a result of numerous purchases 
in the past. Section 4 presents the average and volatility of the “actual ” return, which an 
investor gains if he makes a lot of sales during the “trading day. ” In Section 5, we consider 
the market-based average and volatility of the return of different investors during the “trading 
day.” Section 6, Conclusion. We assume that readers know the basics of probability theory, 
statistical moments, etc. 
2. Market-based averages and volatilities of price and “anticipated ” return 
As “anticipated, ” we consider the stock return r(ti,τ)=p(t i)/p(t i-τ) determined as the ratio of 
market trade price p(ti) at time ti with respect to the price p(ti-τ) at time ti-τ. We consider the 
trade of identical stocks and adjust all prices to the present. Let us consider the time series of  5 the trade values C(t i) and volumes U(t i) at time ti and assume that the trades are made with a 
constant time shift ε: 
𝑡𝑖+1− 𝑡 𝑖= 𝜀   ;      𝜀 − 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡  
Market trade time series present irregular and highly variable data. To forecast the stock 
returns, one should choose the averaging interval Δ>>ε  and estimate the average variables. 
We consider the present time t=t0 as “today, ” and the time tk=t-kΔ, k=1,2,..  describes kΔ 
intervals in the past: 
∆𝑘= [𝑡 𝑘−∆
2; 𝑡𝑘+∆
2]     ;   𝑡 𝑘= 𝑡 − ∆ ∙ 𝑘   ;   𝑘 = 0, 1, 2, …   (2.1) 
We assume that each interval Δk, k=0,1,.. , Δ0= Δ, contains the same number N of terms ti of 
the time series: 
𝑡𝑖∈ ∆   ;   𝑖 = 1, 2, . . 𝑁      (2.2) 
We denote the averaging interval Δ (2.2)  at present time  t as the “trading day. ” We consider 
the trade values C(t i), volumes U(t i), and prices p(ti) during each interval Δk (2.1) as random 
variables. To describe a random variable, one can equally use the probability measure, the 
characteristic function, or the set of statistical moments of the random variable (Shephard, 
1991; Shiryaev, 1999; Shreve, 2004). Finite number of statistical moments describes 
approximations of the characteristic function and probability measure. We derive finite 
number of the statistical moments of price and return that describe approximations of their 
probability measures. We assess the statistical moments of the trade value C(t;n) and volume  
U(t;n)  averaged during the “trading day ” Δ (2.2) by finite number N of trade time series using 
frequency-based probability (1.1) as: 
𝐶(𝑡; 𝑛)= 𝐸 [𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖)]~1
𝑁∑ 𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1     (2.3) 
 𝑈(𝑡; 𝑛)= 𝐸 [𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)]~1
𝑁∑ 𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1      ;    𝑛 = 1,2,.   (2.4) 
We denote E[…]  as the frequency-based mathematical expectation (2.3; 2.4) during Δ (2.2) 
and the symbol “~” to underline that the finite number N of trades determines the 
assessments, the estimators of the statistical moments of trade value C(t;n, ) and volume  
U(t;n)  at time t=t0 “today. ” The finite number n of the s tatistical moments (2.3; 2.4) assess es 
only approximations of the probability and the characteristic functions of the random 
variables C(t i) and U(t i). 
We denote Em[..] as market-based mathematical expectation to differ it from the 
conventional frequency-based one (2.3; 2.4) and describe first two market-based statistical 
moments of price a(t;n)=E m[pn(ti)] and return h(t,τ;n)=E m[rn(ti,τ)] for n=1,2 . We denote the  6 “anticipated ” return r(ti,τ) (2.5) with time shift τ as the ratio of prices p(ti) at times t i to price 
p(ti-τ) in the past: 
 𝑟(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)=𝑝(𝑡𝑖)
𝑝(𝑡𝑖−𝜏)      (2.5) 
Let us transform the trade price equation (1.2):  
𝐶(𝑡𝑖)=  𝑝 (𝑡𝑖)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)=𝑝(𝑡𝑖)
𝑝(𝑡𝑖−𝜏)𝑝(𝑡𝑖− 𝜏)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)= 𝑟(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏) 𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)   
Equations (2.6) link up the sale value C(t i), return r(ti,τ), and the original value Co(ti,τ) of the 
same trade volume U(t i) at price p(ti-τ) in the past: 
𝐶(𝑡𝑖)=  𝑟 (𝑡𝑖, 𝜏) 𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)      ;       𝐶 𝑜(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)= 𝑝(𝑡𝑖− 𝜏)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)  (2.6) 
Equation (2.6) is similar to the trade price equation (1.2), but the price p(ti-τ) defines the 
original value Co(ti,τ) of the trade volume U(t i) in the past at time  ti-τ. Similar to (2.3), we 
assess the frequency-based statistical moments Co(t,τ;n) of the original value Co(ti,τ): 
𝐶𝑜(𝑡, 𝜏; 𝑛 )= 𝐸 [𝐶𝑜𝑛(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)]~1
𝑁∑ 𝐶𝑜𝑛(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)𝑁
𝑖=1    (2.7) 
The m-th degree of (1.2; 2.6) for m=1,2,..,  give equations (2.8; 2.9): 
𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖)= 𝑝𝑚(𝑡𝑖)𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖)    (2.8) 
𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)= 𝑝𝑚(𝑡𝑖− 𝜏)𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖)     ;  𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖)=  𝑟𝑚(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏) 𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)  (2.9) 
The equation (2.8) generates the set of weight functions w(t i;m) (2.10)  
𝑤(𝑡𝑖; 𝑚)=𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖)
∑ 𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1       ;        ∑ 𝑤(𝑡𝑖; 𝑚)𝑁
𝑖=1 = 1   (2.10) 
The weight functions w(t i;m) (2.10) define the average p(t;n,m)  (2.11) of the n-th degree of 
price pn(ti): 
𝑝(𝑡; 𝑛, 𝑚 )=∑ 𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑤(𝑡𝑖; 𝑚)𝑁
𝑖=1 =1
∑ 𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1 ∑ 𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1   (2.11)  
Relations (2.11) present generalization of the well-known volume weighted average price 
(VWAP) (Berkowitz et al., 1988;  Duffie and Dworczak, 2018) p(t;1,1)  for n=1,2,..,  and 
m=1,2,..  . We consider VWAP p(t;1,1)  as market-based average price a(t;1)  and take: 
𝑎(𝑡; 1)= 𝐸 𝑚[𝑝(𝑡𝑖)]= 𝑝(𝑡; 𝑛, 𝑚 )   (2.12)  
The choice (2.12) of market-based average price a(t;1)  determines the dependence of the first 
four market-based statistical moments a(t;n) , n=2,3,4 on statistical moments and correlations 
of trade value and volume (Olkhov, 2022). The dependence of the 2-d price statistical 
moment a(t;2)  (2.13) and price volatility σp2(t) (2.14) on the statistical moments and 
correlations of trade values and volumes take the form: 
𝑎(𝑡; 2)=𝐸𝑚[𝑝2(𝑡𝑖)]=𝐶(𝑡;2)+2𝑎2(𝑡;1)Ω𝑈2(𝑡)−2𝑎 (𝑡;1)𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{𝐶 (𝑡𝑖)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)}
𝑈(𝑡;2)  (2.13) 
𝜎2(𝑡)=𝐸𝑚[(𝑝(𝑡𝑖)− 𝑎(𝑡; 1))2] =Ω𝐶2(𝑡)+𝑎2(𝑡;1)Ω𝑈2(𝑡)−2𝑎 (𝑡;1)𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{𝐶 (𝑡𝑖)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)}
𝑈(𝑡;2)  (2.14)  7 In (2.13; 2.14) ΩC2(t) (2.15) and ΩU2(t) (2.16) denote volatilities of trade value and volume: 
Ω𝐶2(𝑡)= 𝐸[ (𝐶(𝑡𝑖)− 𝐶(𝑡; 1))2]= 𝐶 (𝑡; 2)− 𝐶2(𝑡; 1)  (2.15) 
    Ω𝑈2(𝑡)=  𝐸[ (𝑈(𝑡𝑖)− 𝑈 (𝑡; 1))2] = 𝑈 (𝑡; 2)− 𝑈2(𝑡; 1)  (2.16) 
The correlation corr{C(t i)U(t i)} (2.17) between the trade value C(t i) and volume U(t i) is 
determined by the joint mathematical expectation E[C(t i)U(t i)] of the trade value and volume: 
𝐶𝑈(𝑡; 1,1 )= 𝐸[𝐶 (𝑡𝑖)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)] = 𝐶 (𝑡; 1)𝑈(𝑡; 1)+ 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{𝐶 (𝑡𝑖)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)}  (2.17) 
We refer to Olkhov (2021; 2022) for further details. The similar method allows the use of the 
equations (2.7; 2.9) to derive the dependence of market-based statistical moments of the 
“anticipated ” returns on statistical moments and correlations of the current and past trade 
values and trade volumes (Olkhov, 2023). Similar to (2.11) the weight functions (2.18): 
𝑧(𝑡, 𝜏; 𝑚 )=𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡𝑖,𝜏)
∑ 𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡𝑖,𝜏)𝑁
𝑖=1         ;      ∑ 𝑧(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏; 𝑚 )𝑁
𝑖=1 = 1  (2.18) 
define the average r(t,τ;n,m)  (2.19) of the n-th degree of return rn(ti,τ): 
𝑟(𝑡, 𝜏; 𝑛, 𝑚 )=∑ 𝑟𝑛(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)𝑧(𝑡, 𝜏; 𝑚 )𝑁
𝑖=1 =1
∑ 𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡𝑖,𝜏)𝑁
𝑖=1 ∑ 𝑟𝑛(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)𝑁
𝑖=1   (2.19) 
The definition of the average return r(t,τ;1,1)  (2.19) coincides with Markowitz ’s (1952) 
definition of the portfolio return as an average return weighted by the “relative amount Xi 
invested in security i.” To approve r(t,τ;1,1)  (2.19), one can consider the shares sold during 
the “trading day ” as a “portfolio ” and use Markowitz ’s definition of portfolio return that was 
presented more than 35 years ahead of the definition of VWAP (Berkowitz et al., 1988). The 
replacement of “relative amount invested in security ” by the relative volume of trade 
determined by the weight function w(t i;1) (2.10) determines the VWAP. We take 
Markowitz ’s definition of portfolio return in the form r(t,τ;1,1)  (2.20) as market-based 
average return h(t,τ;1):  
ℎ(𝑡, 𝜏; 1 )= 𝐸 𝑚[𝑟(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)]= 𝑟(𝑡, 𝜏; 1,1 )   (2.20) 
In (Olkhov, 2023) we derive the dependence of the 2-d market- based statistical moment 
h(t,τ;2)  (2.21) and return volatility σ2(t,τ) (2.22) on statistical moments and correlations of the 
current and past trade values and volumes: 
ℎ(𝑡, 𝜏; 2 )= 𝐸 𝑚[𝑟2(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)]=𝐶(𝑡;2)+2ℎ2(𝑡,𝜏;1 )𝛷2(𝑡,𝜏)−2ℎ(𝑡,𝜏;1 )𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{𝐶 (𝑡𝑖)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖,𝜏)}
𝐶𝑜(𝑡,𝜏;2 )  (2.21) 
𝜎2(𝑡, 𝜏)= 𝐸 𝑚[(𝑟(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)− ℎ(𝑡, 𝜏; 1 ))2]=Ω𝐶2(𝑡)+ℎ2(𝑡,𝜏;1 )𝛷2(𝑡,𝜏)−2ℎ(𝑡,𝜏;1 )𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{𝐶 (𝑡𝑖)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖,𝜏)}
𝐶𝑜(𝑡,𝜏;2 )   (2.22) 
The 2-d statistical moment h(t,τ;2)  (2.21) and return volatility σ2(t,τ) (2.22) depend on the 
volatility ΩC2(t) (2.15 ) of the current value and on volatility Φ2(t,τ) (2.23) of the past value: 
𝛷2(𝑡, 𝜏)= 𝐸[ (𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)− 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡, 𝜏; 1 ))2]= 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡, 𝜏; 2 )− 𝐶 𝑜2(𝑡, 𝜏; 1)   (2.23)  8 The joint mathematical expectations (2.24) determines the correlation corr{C(t i)Co(ti,τ)} of 
current and past trade values: 
𝐸[𝐶(𝑡𝑖)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)]=1
𝑁∑ 𝐶(𝑡𝑖)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)= 𝐶 (𝑡; 1)𝑁
𝑖=1 𝐶𝑜(𝑡, 𝜏; 1 )+ 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{𝐶 (𝑡𝑖)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖, 𝜏)}  (2.24) 
The relations (2.12-2.14; 2.20-2.22) describe the market-based average, the 2- d statistical 
moments, and volatilities of price and “anticipated ” stock return, and we refer to Olkhov 
(2021-2023) for further details.  
Now we use the above results to describe the market-based average and volatility of “actual ” 
returns for three cases. In Section 3, for the stock return of a single sale, we assess the 
market-based average and volatility that are generated by numerous purchases of stocks in 
the past. In Section 4, we describe the market-based average and volatility of the return of a 
single investor, which he gains due to multiple sales during the “trading day. ” In Section 5, 
we describe the market-based volatility of returns that different investors gain during the 
“trading day. ” 
3. Market-based “actual ” return of a single sale 
In this section, we consider market-based statistical moments of “actual ” return that an 
investor gains with in a single sale of the volume U(t i) of stocks . We propose that the investor, 
at time ti “today, ” sells U(t i) stocks at a price p(ti). We assume that the investor purchased 
this amount of stocks U(t i) by small stakes of shares U(t j(i)) at different times tj(i), j=1,2, 
..M(i) in the past at a price p(tj(i)). We consider all prices p(tj(i)) adjusted to the present at 
time t. The investor at time tj(i) purchases the original value Co(tj(i)) of the volume U(t j(i)) of 
stocks at price p(tj(i)): 
𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) = 𝑝 (𝑡 𝑗(𝑖)) 𝑈 (𝑡 𝑗(𝑖))    (3.1) 
For each volume U(t j(i)) of stocks purchased in the past at a price p(tj(i)) we use equation 
(3.2) similar to (2.6):  
𝐶 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) = 𝑝 (𝑡𝑖)𝑈 (𝑡 𝑗(𝑖)) =𝑝(𝑡𝑖)
𝑝(𝑡 𝑗(𝑖))𝑝 (𝑡 𝑗(𝑖)) 𝑈 (𝑡 𝑗(𝑖)) = 𝑟 (𝑡 𝑗(𝑖)) 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))   
𝑟 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) ≡𝑝(𝑡𝑖)
𝑝(𝑡 𝑗(𝑖))       
 𝐶(𝑡𝑖)= ∑ 𝐶 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖))𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1    ;       𝐶 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) = 𝑟 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))  (3.2) 
The equation (3.2) introduces the current C(ti,tj(i)) value of the small stakes of shares U(t j(i)) 
that were originally purchased  at price  p(t j(i)) in the past. At time ti, the investor gains the 
“actual ” return r(ti,tj(i)) by selling the volume U(t j(i)) at price p(ti). We denote Co(tj(i)) (3.2)  9 as the original value in the past at a price p(tj(i)) adjusted to the present. The total sale volume 
U(t i) (3.3 ) was purchased in the past by M(i) small stakes of shares U(t j(i)) at prices  p(t j(i)). 
The original value Co(ti) (3.3) of the volume U(t i) (3.4) takes the form:  
𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖)=∑ 𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1=∑  𝑝 (𝑡 𝑗(𝑖)) 𝑈 (𝑡 𝑗(𝑖))𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1  (3.3) 
𝑈(𝑡𝑖)=∑ 𝑈 (𝑡 𝑗(𝑖))𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1    (3.4) 
Obviously, the purchases of stocks in the past at different prices p(tj(i)) result in a different 
“actual ” return r(ti,tj(i)). If the total number  M(i) of the purchases is sufficient ly large, then 
(3.2) allows derive the statistical moments of the “actual ” returns r(ti,tj(i)) of a single market 
sale at a time ti. One should follow s ection 2 and, similar to (2.9), take the m-th power of 
(3.2): 
𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) =  𝑟𝑚(𝑡𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) 𝐶 𝑜𝑚(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))   (3.5) 
We introduce the n-th statistical moments C(t i;n) (3.6) of the sale value C(ti,tj(i)) at ti and the 
n-th statistical moments Co(ti;n) (3.8) of the original value Cp(tj(i)) as: 
𝐶(𝑡𝑖; 𝑛)= 𝐸[𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖))]~1
𝑀(𝑖)∑ 𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖))𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1    (3.6) 
The average current value C(t i;1) (3.6) for n=1 multiplied by M(i) equals the current value 
C(t i) (3.2) of the sale at time ti: 
𝐶(𝑡𝑖)=∑ 𝐶(𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖))𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1= 𝑀(𝑖)𝐶 (𝑡𝑖; 1)    (3.7) 
The statistical moments Co(ti;n) (3.8) of the original value Co(tj(i)) take the form: 
𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖; 𝑛)= 𝐸 [𝐶 𝑜𝑛(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))] ~1
𝑀(𝑖)∑ 𝐶𝑜𝑛(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1   (3.8) 
Similar to (2.18; 2.19), for the equations (3.5), obtain the weight functions s(ti,tj(i));m)  (3.9) :  
𝑠(𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖); 𝑚) =𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))
∑ 𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1         ;      ∑ 𝑠(𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖); 𝑚)𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1= 1  (3.9) 
The weight functions s(ti,tj(i));m)  (3.9) determine the average r(ti;n,m)  (3.10) of the n-th 
degree of return rn(ti,tj(i)) of a single deal: 
𝑟(𝑡𝑖; 𝑛, 𝑚 )=∑ 𝑟𝑛(𝑡𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) 𝑠(𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖); 𝑚)𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1   (3.10) 
We follow (2.20) and define the dependence of the market-based average g(ti;1) (3.11) 
“actual ” return of a single sale of stocks at time ti on the statistical moments of current and 
past trade values (3.6; 3.8; 3.10): 
𝑔(𝑡𝑖; 1)= 𝐸 𝑚[𝑟 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖))] = 𝑟 (𝑡; 1,1 )   ( 3.11)  10 We use (3.6; 3.8) and for the 2-d market-based statistical moment g(ti;2) (3.13 ) and volatility 
σg2(ti) (3.14) of “actual ” return of a single sale of stocks at time ti obtain relations (3.12-3.17) 
that are similar to (2.15; 2.21- 2.24 ): 
𝑔(𝑡𝑖; 2)= 𝐸 𝑚[𝑟2(𝑡𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖))]      
𝜎𝑔2(𝑡𝑖)= 𝐸 𝑚[(𝑟 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) − 𝑔 (𝑡𝑖; 1))2] 
We define market-based volatility σg2(ti) (3.13) as: 
𝜎𝑔2(𝑡𝑖)=∑ (𝑟 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) − 𝑔 (𝑡𝑖; 1))2𝑠(𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖); 2)𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1  (3.12) 
Equation (3.12) provide the consistency of the 1-st g(ti;1) (3.11) and 2-d g(ti;2) (3.13) 
market-based statistical moments of “actual ” return of a single sale and guarantee non-
negativity of volatility σg2(ti) (3.14) of “actual ” return: 
𝑔(𝑡𝑖; 2)=𝐶(𝑡𝑖;2)+2𝑔2(𝑡𝑖;1)𝛷2(𝑡𝑖)−2𝑔 (𝑡𝑖;1)𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{𝐶 (𝑡𝑖,𝑡𝑗(𝑖))𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))}
𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖;2)  (3.13) 
𝜎𝑔2(𝑡𝑖)=Ω𝐶2(𝑡𝑖)+𝑔2(𝑡𝑖;1)𝛷2(𝑡𝑖)−2𝑔 (𝑡𝑖;1)𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{𝐶 (𝑡𝑖,𝑡𝑗(𝑖))𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))}
𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖;2)   (3.14) 
In (3.13; 3.14) we denote the volatilities of current ΩC2(ti) (3.15) and past Φ2(ti) (3.16) trade 
values of a single sale at time ti : 
Ω𝐶2(𝑡𝑖)= 𝐸[(𝐶 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) − 𝐶 (𝑡𝑖; 1))2] = 𝐶 (𝑡𝑖; 2)− 𝐶2(𝑡𝑖; 1)  (3.15) 
𝛷2(𝑡𝑖)= 𝐸[(𝐶 𝑜(𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) − 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡𝑖; 1))2] = 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡𝑖; 2)− 𝐶 𝑜2(𝑡𝑖; 1)  (3.16) 
The relations (3.17; 3.18) determine the correlation corr{C(t i,tj(i))C o(tj(i))} between the current 
C(t i,tj(i)) trade value at ti of stocks that were originally purchased in the past at tj(i) and their 
original value  Co(tj(i)): 
𝐶𝐶 𝑜(𝑡𝑖)= 𝐸 [𝐶 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))] =1
𝑀(𝑖)∑ 𝐶 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1  (3.17) 
𝐶𝐶 𝑜(𝑡𝑖)= 𝐶 (𝑡𝑖; 1)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖; 1)+ 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 {𝐶 (𝑡 𝑖, 𝑡𝑗(𝑖)) 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡𝑗(𝑖))}  (3.18) 
4. Market-based “actual ” return of a single investor  
In this section, we consider the market-based average and volatility of the “actual ” return of a 
single investor during the “trading day ” (2.2).  
Actually, different deals at times ti, i=1,2,..N  during the “trading day ” (2.2) result in different 
market-based average returns g(ti;n) (3.11). One can consider different returns  g(ti;n) (3.11) 
that a single investor gains during the “trading day ” as a random variable. To describe the 
market-based random properties of average returns  g(ti;n) (3.11) we consider equation (4.1)  11 that describe the dependence of on market-based average return g(ti;1) of a single deal during 
the “trading day ” on average current C(t i;1) (3.6) and past Co(ti;1) (3.8) trade values: 
𝐶(𝑡𝑖; 1)= 𝑔(𝑡𝑖; 1)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖; 1)      (4.1) 
In the equation (4.1) we consider the current C(t i;1) (3.6), past Co(ti;1) (3.8) trade values, and 
average return g(ti;1) at time ti as random variables during the “trading day ” (2.2). One can 
consider (4.1) similar to the trade return equations (3.2; 3.5) and reproduce the same 
calculations but with respect to the market-based average return g(ti;1) (3.11) of a single deal.  
Let us take the n-th degree of (4.1 ): 
𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖; 1)= 𝑔𝑛(𝑡𝑖; 1)𝐶𝑜𝑛(𝑡𝑖; 1)    (4.2) 
Similar to (3.6-3.10) we define the frequency-based n-th statistical moments (4.3; 4.4) of 
current and past trade values: 
𝐶(𝑡; 1|𝑛 )= 𝐸 [𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖; 1)]~1
𝑁∑ 𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖; 1)𝑁
𝑖=1     (4.3) 
𝐶𝑜(𝑡; 1|𝑛 )= 𝐸 [𝐶𝑜𝑛(𝑡𝑖; 1)]~1
𝑁∑ 𝐶𝑜𝑛(𝑡𝑖; 1)𝑁
𝑖=1     (4.4) 
Similar to (3.9), we define the weight functions γ(ti;1|m)  (4.5):  
𝛾(𝑡𝑖; 1|𝑚 )=𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡𝑖;1)
∑ 𝐶𝑜𝑚((𝑡𝑖;1))𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1         ;      ∑ 𝛾(𝑡𝑖; 1|𝑚 )𝑁
𝑖=1 = 1  (4.5) 
The weight functions  γ(ti;1|m)  (4.5) and the equation (4.2) define the average 
ϱ(t;1|n,m)=E[gn(ti;1)] (4.6) of the n-th degree gn(ti;1): 
𝜚(𝑡; 1|𝑛, 𝑚 )=∑ 𝑔𝑛(𝑡𝑖; 1) 𝛾(𝑡𝑖; 1|𝑚 )𝑀(𝑖)
𝑗=1   (4.6) 
Similar to (3.11) we choose the market-based average of return G(t|1) (4.7) that is determined 
by numerous deals of a single investor during the “trading day ” to be equal the average 
ϱ(t;1|1,1)  (4.6): 
𝐺(𝑡|1)= 𝐸 𝑚[𝑔(𝑡𝑖; 1)]= 𝜚(𝑡; 1|1,1 )    (4.7) 
Similar to (3.12-3.17) the choice of G(t|1) (4.7) determines the market-based 2-d statistical 
moment  G(t|2) (4.8) and the volatility σG2(t) (4.9) of the return of a sing investor: 
𝐺(𝑡|2) = 𝐸 𝑚[𝑔2(𝑡𝑖; 1)]      
𝐺(𝑡; 1|2) =𝐶(𝑡;1|2 )+2𝐺2(𝑡|1)𝛷2(𝑡)−2𝐺 (𝑡|1)𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{ 𝐶(𝑡𝑖;1)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖;1)}
𝐶𝑜(𝑡;1|2 )   (4.8) 
𝜎𝐺2(𝑡𝑖)= 𝐸 𝑚[(𝑔(𝑡𝑖; 1)− 𝐺 (𝑡; 1|1 ))2]     
𝜎𝐺2(𝑡)=Ω𝐶2(𝑡)+𝐺2(𝑡|1)𝛷2(𝑡)−2𝐺 (𝑡|1)𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{ 𝐶(𝑡𝑖;1)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖;1)}
𝐶𝑜(𝑡;1|2 )    (4.9) 
The market-based volatility σG2(t) (4.9) of return of a single investor depends on volatility  
ΩC2(t) (4.10) of his average current sales C(t i;1) (3.6) and on volatility Φ2(t) (4.11) of the 
average original values C0(ti;1) (3.8) at times ti during the “trading day ”:  12 Ω𝐶2(𝑡)= 𝐸[ (𝐶(𝑡𝑖; 1)− 𝐶(𝑡; 1|1 ))2]= 𝐶 (𝑡; 1|2 )− 𝐶2(𝑡; 1|1 )  (4.10) 
𝛷2(𝑡)= 𝐸[ (𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖; 1)− 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡; 1|1 ))2]= 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡; 1|2 )− 𝐶 𝑜2(𝑡; 1|1 )  (4.11) 
As well, the market-based volatility σG2(t) (4.9) depends on correlation corr{C(t i;1)C o(ti;1)} 
(4.13) between the average current sales C(t i;1) (3.6) and original values C0(ti;1) (3.8) at 
times ti during the “trading day ”. From (4.3; 4.4) obtain: 
𝐸[𝐶(𝑡𝑖; 1)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖; 1)]=1
𝑁∑ 𝐶(𝑡𝑖; 1)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖; 1)𝑁
𝑖=1    (4.12) 
𝐸[𝐶(𝑡𝑖; 1)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖; 1)]= 𝐶 (𝑡; 1|1 )𝐶𝑜(𝑡; 1|1 )+ 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{𝐶 (𝑡𝑖; 1)𝐶𝑜(𝑡𝑖; 1)}  (4.13) 
5. Market based volatility of return of different investors 
In this s ection, we assess the market-based average and volatility of “actual ” return that many 
different investors gain during the “trading day. ” Indeed, the average return that each of 
numerous investors gain during the “trading day ” varies a lot. One can consider the average 
returns of many different investors as a random variable. The market-based volatility of 
average returns describes the uncertainty of trade outcome of investors during the “trading 
day.”  
Let us assu me that during the “trading day ” the investor q, q=1,..Q  gain average return 
G(t;1|q) (4.7) and consider the trade return equation (5.1) on average current value C(t;1|1,q)  
(4.3), original value C0(t;1|1,q),  and average return G(t;1|q)  (4.7) of investor q: 
𝐶(𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 )= 𝐺 (𝑡; 1|𝑞) 𝐶𝑜(𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 )     ;       𝑞 = 1, … 𝑄    (5.1) 
In (5.1) we add variable q in the current value C(t;1|1,q)  (4.3), original value C0(t;1|1,q),  and 
average return G(t;1|q)  (4.7) to highlight their dependence on trade outcomes of investor q 
during the “trading day. ” We consider the equation (5.1) similar to (4.1) and take the n-th 
degree of (5.1): 
𝐶𝑛(𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 )= 𝐺𝑛(𝑡; 1|𝑞) 𝐶𝑜𝑛(𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 )   (5.2) 
 Similar to (4.3; 4.4) we define the frequency-based m-th statistical moments of current 
C(t|m ) (5.3) and past Co(t|m) (5.4) trade values that are determined by of different investors 
during the “trading day ”: 
𝐶(𝑡|𝑚)=1
𝑄∑ 𝐶𝑚(𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 )𝑄
𝑞=1     (5.3) 
𝐶𝑜(𝑡|𝑚)=∑  𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 )𝑄
𝑞=1     (5.4) 
Similar to (4.5), equation (5.2) defines the weight functions φ(t|m,q)  (5.5): 
𝜑(𝑡|𝑚, 𝑞 )= 𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡;1|1,𝑞 )
∑  𝐶𝑜𝑚(𝑡;1|1,𝑞 )𝑄
𝑞=1         ;      ∑ 𝜑(𝑡|𝑚, 𝑞 )𝑄
𝑞=1 = 1   (5.5)  13 The weight functions φ(t|m,q)  (5.5) define the frequency-based averages D(t|n,m)  (5.6) of the 
n-th degree of return Gn(t;1|q)  (4.7) over the set of numerous investors q=1,2,..Q : 
𝐷(𝑡|𝑛, 𝑚 )=∑ 𝐺𝑛(𝑡; 1|𝑞 ) 𝜑(𝑡|𝑚, 𝑞 )𝑄
𝑞=1    (5.6) 
We define the market-based average return R(t|1) (5.7) as: 
𝑅(𝑡|1)= 𝐸 𝑚[𝐺(𝑡𝑖; 1|𝑞 )]= 𝐷 (𝑡|1,1 )   (5.7) 
Similar to (4.9) we define market-based volatility σR2(t) (5.8) of return determined by 
numerous different investors during the “trading day ”: 
𝜎𝑅2(𝑡𝑖)= 𝐸 𝑚[(𝐺(𝑡𝑖; 1|𝑞 )− 𝑅(𝑡|1))2] 
𝜎𝑅2(𝑡𝑖)= ∑ (𝐺 (𝑡𝑖; 1|𝑞 )− 𝑅(𝑡|1))2 𝜑(𝑡|𝑚, 𝑞 )𝑄
𝑞=1 
𝜎𝑅2(𝑡)=Ω𝑅2(𝑡)+𝑅2(𝑡|1)𝛷𝑅2(𝑡)−2𝑅 (𝑡|1)𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{ 𝐶((𝑡;1|1,𝑞 ))𝐶𝑜((𝑡;1|1,𝑞 ))}
𝐶𝑜(𝑡|2)  (5.8) 
The market-based volatility  σR2(t) (5.8) depends upon the volatilities of current Ω R2(t) (5.9)   
and past ΦR2(t) (5.10) trade values during the “trading day ”: 
Ω𝑅2(𝑡)= 𝐸[ (𝐶(𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 )− 𝐶(𝑡|1))2]= 𝐶 (𝑡|2)− 𝐶2(𝑡|1)  (5.9) 
𝛷𝑅2(𝑡)= 𝐸[ (𝐶𝑜(𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 )− 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡|1))2]= 𝐶 𝑜(𝑡|2)− 𝐶 𝑜2(𝑡|1) (5.10) 
The market-based volatility σR2(t) (5.8) also depends on correlation 
corr{C(t;1|1,q )Co(t;1|1,q )} (5.12) between the current C(t;1|1,q))  (5.3) and original values 
C0(t;1|1,q)  (5.4) of investors q=1,2,..Q  during the “trading day ”: 
𝐸[𝐶( (𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 ))𝐶𝑜((𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 ))] =1
𝑄∑ 𝐶((𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 ))𝐶𝑜((𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 ))𝑄
𝑞=1   (5.11) 
𝐸[𝐶((𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 ))𝐶𝑜((𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 ))]= 𝐶 (𝑡|1)𝐶𝑜(𝑡|1)+ 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{𝐶 ((𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 ))𝐶𝑜((𝑡; 1|1, 𝑞 ))} (5.12) 
6. Conclusion 
This paper describes three successive approximations of the market-based averages 
and volatilities of the “actual ” return that the investors gain during the “trading day. ” We 
describe the approximations of return generated by a single trade sale, by a single investor , 
and by all investors during the “trading day. ” We derive the dependence of the market-based 
averages and volatilities on statistical moments, volatilities, and correlations of the current 
and past trade values. Let us highlight some problems that seem to be important for the 
description of financial markets. 
The market-based average and volatility of return that all investors “actually ” gain as 
a result of their sales during the “trading day ” can serve as benchmarks and impact the 
decisions of “purchasing ” investors in financial markets. “Purchasing ” investors can assess 
their forecast of the expected returns at horizon T in comparison with the “actual ” returns that  14 “selling ” investors already gain. Analysis of relations between the statistical moments of 
return that “selling ” investors already gain and predictions of the statistical moments of return 
of “purchasing ” investors can help develop further asset pricing models and portfolio theory. 
The volatility of return (5.8) describes the distribution of the “actual ” returns over numerous 
investors in the stock market.  
Probably, it is difficult to collect and study the market data that permit the 
assessments of market-based averages and volatilities of the “actual ” return of a single 
investor and of all investors during the “trading day. ” The market data that define the market-
based averages and volatilities of “anticipated ” returns (Section 2) are much more available. 
It is important to study relations between statistical moments of “anticipated ” and “actual ” 
return and highlight possible dependence between these factors.  
The fluctuations of the “anticipated ” returns due to the variations of the time shift τ 
can impact the duration of stock holding by the investors. That, in turn, can change the scales 
and fluctuations of “anticipated ” returns determined by the time shift τ. Investigation of the 
hidden mutual dependence between the market-based statistics of the “actual ” return of 
investors and the statistics of the “anticipated ” return can help increase the efficiency of 
portfolio performance and asset pricing models.    15 References
