Abstract
In this paper, we explore the dynamics of two monopoly models with knowledgeable players.
The rst model was initially introduced by Naimzada and Ricchiuti, while the second one is sim-
plied from a famous monopoly introduced by Puu. We employ several tools based on symbolic
computations to analyze the local stability and bifurcations of the two models. To the best of our
knowledge, the complete stability conditions of the second model are obtained for the rst time. We
also investigate periodic solutions as well as their stability. Most importantly, we discover that the
topological structure of the parameter space of the second model is much more complex than that
of the rst one. Specically, in the rst model, the parameter region for the stability of any periodic
orbit with a xed order constitutes a connected set. In the second model, however, the stability
regions for the 3-cycle, 4-cycle, and 5-cycle orbits are disconnected sets formed by many disjoint
portions. Furthermore, we nd that the basins of the two stable equilibria in the second model are
disconnected and also have complicated topological structures. In addition, the existence of chaos
in the sense of Li-Yorke is rigorously proved by nding snapback repellers and 3-cycle orbits in the
two models, respectively.

1 Introduction
Unlike a competitive market with a large number of relatively small companies producing homogeneous
products and competing with each other, an oligopoly is a market supplied only by a few rms. It
is well known that Cournot developed the rst formal theory of oligopoly in [7], where players are
supposed to have the naive expectations that their rivals produce the same quantity of output as in
the immediately previous period. Cournot introduced a gradient mechanism of adjusting the quantity
of output and proved that his model has one unique equilibrium, which is globally stable provided
that only two rms exist in the market.
A monopoly is the simplest oligopoly, which is a market served by one unique rm. In the existing
literature, a market supplied by two, three, or even four companies is called a duopoly [17], a triopoly
[19], or a quadropoly [21], respectively. However, a monopoly may also exhibit complex dynamic
behaviors such as periodic orbits and chaos if the involved rm is supposed to be boundedly rational.
As distinguished by Matsumoto and Szidarovszky [22], a boundedly rational monopolist is said to be
knowledgeable if it has full information regarding the inverse demand function, and limited if it does
not know the form of the inverse demand function but possesses the values of output and price only
in the past two periods. Knowledgeable and limited players have been considered in several monopoly
models.
For example, Puu [26] introduced a monopoly where the inverse demand function is a cubic func-
tion with an inection point, and the marginal cost is quadratic. In this model, the monopolist is

1arXiv:2301.01497v1  [econ.TH]  4 Jan 2023supposed to be a limited player. Puu indicated that there exist multiple (at most three) equilibria, and
complex dynamics such as chaos may appear if the reactivity of the monopolist becomes suciently
large. Moreover, Puu's model was reconsidered by Al-Hdaibat and others in [1], where a numerical
continuation method is used to compute solutions with dierent periods and determine their stability
regions. In particular, they analytically investigated general formulae for solutions with period four.
It should be mentioned that the equilibrium multiplicity and complex dynamics of Puu's model
might depend strictly on the inverse demand function that has an inection point. In this regard,
Naimzada and Ricchiuti [25] introduced a simpler monopoly with a knowledgeable player, where the
inverse demand function is still cubic but has no inection points. It was discovered that complex
dynamics can also arise, especially when the reaction coecient to variation in prots is high. Askar [2]
and Sarafopoulos [27] generalized the inverse demand function of Naimzada and Ricchiuti to a function
of a similar form, but the degree of their function could be any positive integer. The dierence is that
the cost function in Askar's model is linear but quadratic in Sarafopoulos's.
Cavalli and Naimzada [4] studied a monopoly model characterized by a constant elasticity demand
function, in which the rm is also assumed to be knowledgeable with a linear cost. They focused on
the equilibrium stability as the variation of the price elasticity of demand and proved that there are
two possible dierent cases, where elasticity has either a stabilizing or a mixed stabilizing/destabilizing
eect. Moreover, Elsadany and Awad [8] explored a monopoly game with delays where the inverse
demand is a log-concave function. Caravaggio and Sodini [3] considered a nonlinear model, where
a knowledgeable monopolist provides a xed amount of an intermediate good and then uses this
good to produce two vertically dierentiated nal commodities. They found that there are chaotic
and multiple attractors. Furthermore, continuous dynamical systems have also been applied in the
study of monopolistic markets. In [23], Matsumoto and Szidarovszky proposed a monopoly model
formulated in continuous time and investigated the eect of delays in obtaining and implementing the
output information. Motivated by the aforementioned work, other remarkable contributions including
[9, 10] were done in this strand of research.
In our study, we consider two monopoly models formulated with discrete dynamical systems, where
the players are supposed to be knowledgeable. The two models are distinct mainly in their inverse
demand functions. The rst model uses the inverse demand of Naimzada and Ricchiuti [25], while the
second one employs that of Puu [26]. For both models, we analyze the existence and local stability of
equilibria and periodic solutions by using tools based on symbolic computations such as the method
of triangular decomposition and the method of partial cylindrical algebraic decomposition. It should
be mentioned that dierent from numerical computations, symbolic computations are exact, thus the
results can be used to rigorously prove economic theorems in some sense.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows. To the best of our knowledge, the complete
stability conditions of the second model are obtained for the rst time. We also investigate the periodic
solutions in the two models as well as their stability. Most importantly, we nd dierent topological
structures of the parameter spaces of the two considered models. Specically, in the rst model, the
parameter region for the stability of any periodic solution with a xed order constitutes a connected
set. In the second model, however, the stability regions for the 3-cycle, 4-cycle, and 5-cycle orbits are
disconnected sets formed by many disjoint portions. In other words, the topological structures of the
regions for stable periodic orbits in Model 2 are much more complex than those in Model 1. This may
be because the inverse demand function of Model 2 has an inection point. Furthermore, according
to our numerical simulations of Model 2, it is discovered that the basins of the two stable equilibria
are disconnected and also have complex topological structures. In addition, the existence of chaos in
the sense of Li-Yorke is rigorously proved by nding snapback repellers and 3-cycle orbits in the two
models, respectively.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we revisit the construction of the two
models. In Section 3, the local stability of the equilibrium is thoroughly studied, and bifurcations
through which the equilibrium loses its stability are also investigated. In Section 4, the existence and
stability of periodic orbits with relatively lower orders are explored for the two models. In Section 5,
we rigorously derive the existence of chaotic dynamics in the sense of Li-Yorke. The paper is concluded
with some remarks in Section 6.
22 Basic Models
Suppose a monopolist exists in the market, and the quantity of its output is denoted as x. We useP(x)
to denote the price function (also called inverse demand function), which is assumed to be downward
sloping, i.e.,
dP(x)
dx<0;for anyx>0: (1)
It follows that P(x) is invertible. The demand function (the inverse of P(x)) exists and is also
downward sloping. Furthermore, the cost function is denoted as C(x). Then the prot is
(x) =P(x)x C(x):
The monopolist is assumed to adopt a gradient mechanism of adjusting its output to achieve
increased prots. Suppose that the rm is a knowledgeable player, which means that it has full
information regarding the inverse demand function P(x) and has the capability of computing the
marginal prot d =dx. The rm adjusts its output by focusing on how the variation of xaects the
variation of ( x). Specically, the adjustment process is formulated as
x(t+ 1) =x(t) +Kd(x(t))
dx(t); K > 0:
SinceK > 0, a positive marginal prot induces the monopolist to adjust the quantity of its output in
a positive direction and vice versa.
The rst model considered in this paper was initially proposed by Naimzada and Ricchiuti [25],
where a cubic price function without the inection point is employed. We restate the formulation of
this model in the sequel.
Model 1. The price function is cubic and the cost function is linear as follows.
P(x) =a bx3; C (x) =cx;
wherea;b;c are parameters. The downward sloping condition (1) is guaranteed if d P=dx= 3bx2<0,
that is ifb >0. Moreover, assume that the marginal cost d C=dx=c >0. We adopt the general
principle of setting price above marginal cost, i.e., P(x) c >0 for anyx0. Therefore, we must
have thata>c . One knows the prot function is
(x) =P(x)x C(x) = (a bx3)x cx= (a c)x bx4:
Thus, the gradient adjustment mechanism can be described as
x(t+ 1) =x(t) +K(a c 4bx3(t)); K > 0:
Without loss of generality, we denote f= 4bKande= (a c)=4b. Then, the model is simplied into
a map with only two parameters:
x(t+ 1) =x(t) +f(e x3(t)); e;f > 0: (2)
The second model considered in this paper is simplied from a famous monopoly model introduced
by Puu [26]. We retain the same inverse demand function and cost function. The only dierence is
that the monopolist in our model is knowledgeable, whereas the monopolist in Puu's original model
is limited.
Model 2. The price function is cubic of a more general form
P(x) =a1 b1x+c1x2 d1x3;
wherea1;b1;c1;d1>0 are parameters. The cost function is also cubic and has no xed costs, i.e.,
C(x) =a2x b2x2+c2x3;
3wherea2;b2;c2>0. Hence, the prot function becomes
(x) =P(x)x C(x) = (a1 a2)x (b1 b2)x2+ (c1 c2)x3 d1x4;
which can be denoted as
(x) =ax bx2+cx3 dx4
with
a=a1 a2; b=b1 b2; c=c1 c2;andd=d1:
For the sake of simplicity, we assume that a;b;c;d> 0. The marginal prot d=dxis directly obtained
and the gradient adjustment mechanism can be formulated as
x(t+ 1) =x(t) +K(a 2bx(t) + 3cx2(t) 4dx3(t)); a;b;c;d> 0: (3)
3 Local Stability and Bifurcations
Firstly, we explain the main idea of the symbolic approach used in this paper by analyzing stepwise
the local stability of Model 1. Then the theoretical results of Model 2 are reported without giving all
the calculation details.
3.1 Model 1
Proposition 1. Model 1 always has a unique equilibrium, which is stable if
4b(a c)2K3<8
27
Moreover, there is a period-doubling bifurcation if
4b(a c)2K3=8
27:
The above proposition is a known result, which was rst derived by Naimzada and Ricchiuti
[25]. Indeed, this proposition can be easily proved since the analytical expression of the unique
equilibrium can be obtained, i.e., x= (a c
4b)1=3:However, we would like to provide another proof in
a computational style to demonstrate in detail how our symbolic approach works.
In what follows, the model formulation (2) is taken. By setting x(t+ 1) =x(t) =x, we acquire
the equilibrium equation x=x+f(e x3). An equilibrium xof the one-dimensional iteration map is
locally stable if dx(t+ 1)
dx(t)
x(t)=x=1 3fx2<1:
Moreover, we say the equilibrium xto be feasible if x>0. Thus, a stable and feasible equilibrium can
be characterized as a real solution of
8

x>0; e> 0; f > 0:(4)
Although system (4) is so simple that one can solve the closed-form expression of xfrom the
equality part, the problem is how we handle a general polynomial that may have no closed-form
solutions. Furthermore, it is also a nontrivial task to identify the conditions on the parameters
whether a system with inequalities has real solutions. In [18], the rst author of this paper and his
coworker proposed an algebraic approach to systematically tackle these problems. The main idea of
this approach is as follows.
The parametric system (4) is univariate in x. For a univariate system, we introduce a key concept
called border polynomial in the sequel. One useful property of a border polynomial is that its real
zeros divide the parameter space into separated regions and the solution number of the original system
is invariant for all parameter points in each region.
4Denition 1 (Border Polynomial) .Consider a univariate system
(
P(u;x) =Pm
i=0ai(u)xi= 0;
Q1(u;x)>0;:::;Q s(u;x)>0;(5)
wherePandQ1;:::;Q sare univariate polynomials in x, andustands for all parameters. The product
am(u)discr(P)sY
i=1res(P;Q i)
is called the border polynomial of system (5). Here, res( F;G) stands for the resultant of two polyno-
mialsFandG, while discr( F) denotes the discriminant of F.
More specically, the formal denitions of the resultant and the discriminant in the above denition
are given as follows. Let
F=mX
i=0aixi; G =lX
j=0bjxj
be two univariate polynomials in xwith coecients ai;bjin the eld of complex numbers, and am;bl6=
0. The determinant amam 1a0

is called the Sylvester resultant (or simply resultant ) ofFandG, and denoted by res( F;G). The
resultant of Fand its derivative d F=dx, i.e., res(F;dF=dx), is called the discriminant ofFand
denoted by discr( F). The following lemma is one of the well-known properties of resultants, which
could be found in [24].
Lemma 1. Two univariate polynomials FandGhave common zeros in the eld of complex numbers
if and only if res(F;G) = 0 . Moreover, a univariate polynomial Fhas a multiple zero in the eld of
complex numbers if and only if discr(F) = 0 .
It is worth noticing that the number of real zeros of Pmay change when the leading coecient
am(u) or the discriminant discr( P) goes from non-zero to zero and vice versa. In addition, if res( P;Q i)
goes across zero, then the zeros of Pwill pass through the boundaries of Qi>0, which means that
the number of real roots of (5) may change. Therefore, the following lemma is derived.
Lemma 2. Consider a univariate system as (5). LetAandBbe two points in the space of parameters
u. Suppose that any of A,Bdoes not annihilate the border polynomial of system (5). If there exists
a real path CfromAtoBsuch that any point on Cis not a root of the border polynomial, then the
number of real solutions of system (5)evaluated at Ais the same as that at B.
Since 1 3fx2<1, we know that system (4) is equivalent to
8

We haveam= 1 and discr( x3 e) = 27e2. Moreover, res( x3 e;2 3fx2) = 27e2f3+ 8 and
res(x3 e;x) =e. According to Denition 1, the border polynomial of system (6) is 27 e3( 27e2f3+8),
the zeros of which are marked in blue as shown in Figure 1. This blue curve divides the parameter
setf(e;f)je>0;f > 0ginto two (the northeast and the southwest) regions.

fFigure 1: Partitions of the parameter space of Model 1 and sample points
Notice the two points S2andAin Figure 1. One can nd a real path CfromAtoS2such that
it does not pass through the blue curve. According to Lemma 2, system (6) has the same number of
real roots with the parameters evaluated at S2andA. This means that the number of real solutions
of system (6) is invariant in the northeast region. Therefore, we can choose a sample point from each
region to determine the root number. For this simple system, sample points might be selected directly
by eyes, e.g., S1= (1;1=2),S2= (1;1). However, the choosing process might be extremely complex in
general, which could be done automatically by using, e.g., the method of partial cylindrical algebraic
decomposition or called the PCAD method [5].
For each region, one can determine the root number by counting roots of the non-parametric system
of (6) evaluated at the corresponding sample point. Take S1as an example, where (6) becomes

x3 1 = 0;2 3
2x2>0; x> 0
: (7)
In order to count the number of its real roots, an obvious way is directly solving x3 1 = 0, i.e.,x= 1,
and then checking whether 2  3
2x2>0 andx>0 are satised. The result is true, which means that
there exists one unique real solution of (7). However, it is dicult to precisely obtain all real zeros
of a general univariate system since root formulae do not exist for polynomials with degrees greater
than 4. Therefore, a more systematic method called real root counting [31] is generally needed here,
and we demonstrate how this method works by using (7) as an example.
It is noted that x3 1, 2 3
2x2andxhave no common zeros, i.e., they have no factors in common.
Otherwise, one needs to reduce the common factors from the inequalities rst. After that, we isolate
all real zeros of 2  3
2x2andxby rational intervals, e.g.,

 12
10; 11
10
;
 1
10;1
10
;11
10;12
10
: (8)
Although it is trivial for this simple example, the isolation process could be particularly tough for
general polynomials, which may be handled by using, e.g., the modied Uspensky algorithm [6].
Moreover, the intervals can be made as small as possible to guarantee no zeros of x3 1 lie in these
intervals, which could be checked by using, e.g., Sturm's theorem [28]. Thus, the real zeros of x3 1
must be in the complement of (8):

 1; 12
10
;
 11
10; 1
10
;1
10;11
10
;12
10;+1
: (9)
In each of these open intervals, the signs of 2  3
2x2andxare invariant and can be determined
by checking them at selected sample points. For instance, to determine the sign of 2  3
2x2on
6(12=10;+1), we check the sign at a sample point, e.g., x= 2. We have that 2  3
2x2jx=2= 4<0,
thus 2 3
2x2<0 on (12=10;+1). Similarly, it is obtained that the signs of 2  3
2x2andxat (9) are
 ;+;+; and ; ;+;+, respectively. Hence, (1 =10;11=10) is the only interval such that the two
inequalities 2 3
2x2>0 andx>0 of system (7) are simultaneously satised.
We focus on (1 =10;11=10). Using Sturm's theorem, we can count the number of the real zeros
ofx3 1 at (1=10;11=10), which is one. Therefore, system (6) has one real root at S1= (1;1=2).
The above approach works well for a system formulated with univariate polynomial equations and
inequalities although some steps seem silly and not necessary for this simple example. Similarly, we
know that system (6) has no real roots at S2= (1;1).
In conclusion, system (6) has one real root if the parameters take values from the southwest region
whereS1lies, and has no real roots if the parameters take values from the northeast region where S2
lies. Furthermore, the inequalities of some factors of the border polynomial may be used to explicitly
describe a given region. It is evident that 27 e2f3 8<0 describes the region where S1lies. Therefore,
Model 1 has one unique stable equilibrium provided that
e2f3=a c
4b2
(4bK)3= 4b(a c)2K3<8
27;
which is consistent with Proposition 1.
According to the classical bifurcation theory, for a one-dimensional iteration map x(t+1) =F(x(t)),
we know that bifurcations may occur if
dx(t+ 1)
dx(t)
x(t)=x=dF
dx= 1:
More specically, if d F=dx= 1, then the system may undergo a period-doubling bifurcation (also
called ip bifurcation), where the dynamics switch to a new behavior with twice the period of the
original system. On the other hand, if d F=dx= 1, then the system may undergo a saddle-node (fold),
transcritical, or pitchfork bifurcation. One might determine the type of bifurcation from the change
in the number of the (stable) equilibria. In the case of saddle-node bifurcation, one stable equilibrium
(a node) annihilates with another unstable one (a saddle). Before and after a transcritical bifurcation,
there is one unstable and one stable equilibrium, and the unstable equilibrium becomes stable and
vice versa. In the case of pitchfork bifurcation, the number of equilibria changes from one to three or
from three to one, while the number of stable equilibria changes from one to two or from one to zero.
Accordingly, it is concluded that Model 1 may undergo a period-doubling bifurcation if
e2f3= 4b(a c)2K3=8
27;
and there are no other bifurcations.
3.2 Model 2
According to (3), by setting x(t+ 1) =x(t) =x, we know that Model 2 has at most three equilibria.
The analytical expressions of the equilibria exist, but are complex, i.e.,
x1=3p

7Furthermore, an equilibrium xis locally stable provided that
dx(t+ 1)
dx(t)
x(t)=x=1 +K( 2b+ 6cx 12dx2)<1:
Hence, a stable equilibrium of map (3) is a real solution of

K( 2b+ 6cx 12dx2)<0;
2 +K( 2b+ 6cx 12dx2)>0;
x>0; a> 0; b> 0; c> 0; d> 0:(11)
Obviously, analyzing the stable equilibrium by substituting the closed-form solutions (10) into (11)
is complicated and impractical. In comparison, the approach applied in the analysis of Model 1 does
not require explicitly solving any closed-form equilibrium. If the analytical solution has a complicated
expression or even if there are no closed-form solutions, our approach still works in theory.
Concerning the border polynomial of system (11), we compute
discr(K(a 2bx+ 3cx2 4dx3)) = 16K5dR1;
res(K(a 2bx+ 3cx2 4dx3);K( 2b+ 6cx 12dx2)) = 16K5dR1;
res(K(a 2bx+ 3cx2 4dx3);2 +K( 2b+ 6cx 12dx2)) = 16K2dR2;
res(K(a 2bx+ 3cx2 4dx3);x) = Ka;
where
R1= 108a2d2 108abcd + 27ac3+ 32b3d 9b2c2;
R2= 108K3a2d2 108K3abcd + 27K3ac3+ 32K3b3d 9K3b2c2 24Kbd + 9Kc2 8d:
Therefore, the border polynomial is  16384d4K14aR2

least one sample point from each region. In Table 1, we list the 30 selected sample points and the
corresponding numbers of distinct real solutions of system (11).

According to Table 1, one can see that system (11) has one real solution if and only if R1<0;R2>0

8R1<0 andR2<0, which is not a sucient condition, however. For example, at ( a;b;c;d;K ) =
(1;1;1=4;1=64;2), system (11) has no real solutions but R1<0 andR2<0 are fullled. To acquire
the necessary and sucient condition, additional polynomials ( R3andR4) are needed, which can be
found in the so-called generalized discriminant list and can be picked out by repeated trials. Regarding
the generalized discriminant list, readers may refer to [32] for more details. Due to space limitations,
we directly report below the necessary and sucient condition that system (11) has two real solutions
without giving the calculation details:

a period-doubling bifurcation if

By using the method of triangular decomposition1, we transform the solutions of the rst two equations
of system (12) into zeros of the triangular set
T= [(8Kbd 3Kc2+ 4d)x 6adK +bcK c;R2]:

and count the number of stable equilibria. More details are not reported here due to space limitations.
We summarize all the obtained results in the following theorem.
1The method of triangular decomposition can be viewed as an extension of the method of Gaussian elimination. The
main idea of both methods is to transform a system into a triangular form. However, the triangular decomposition
method is available for polynomial systems, while the Gaussian elimination method is just for linear systems. Refer to
[30, 16, 12, 29] for more details.
9Theorem 1. Model 2 has at most two stable equilibria. Specically, there exists just one stable
equilibrium if
R1<0;R2>0orR1>0;R2<0;
and there exist two stable equilibria if

Remark 1.To the best of our knowledge, the stability results regarding the parameters a;b;c;d;K
reported in Theorem 1 are new although the special case of a= 3:6,b= 2:4,c= 0:6,d= 0:05 has
been discussed in [22]. The two parameters K;a play more ambitious roles than others in practice for
Kcontrols the speed of adjusting the monopolist's output and ais the dierence between the initial
product price of the market without any supply and the initial marginal cost of the rm without any
production. By xing b= 2:4,c= 0:6 andd= 0:05, we depict the ( a;K) parameter plane in Figure
2, where the region for the existence of one stable equilibrium is colored in yellow, while the region for
the existence of two stable equilibria is colored in blue-gray. Model 2 behaves dierently from typical
oligopolies with gradient mechanisms. As shown by Figure 2, for instance, even if the adjustment
speedKis quite large, there always exist some values of asuch that Model 2 is stable. Moreover, for
a xed value of Kgreater than around 1 :7, Model 2 undergoes from instability to stability and then
back to instability twice as the parameter achanges from low to high.

104 Periodic Solutions
From an economic point of view, it is realistic to assume that a boundedly rational rm can not learn
the pattern behind output and prots if periodic dynamics take place. In this regard, we investigate
the existence and stability of periodic solutions with relatively lower orders in this section.
LetIbe an interval of real numbers, and let F:I!R be a function. If x2I, suppose that
F0(x) represents xandFn+1(x) denotesF(Fn(x)) forn2f0;1;:::g. A pointp2Iis said to be a
periodic point with period nor ordernifp=Fn(p), andp6=Fk(p) for any 1k<n . Ifpis a point
with period n, we callp7!F1(p)7!7!Fn(p) =pan-cycle orbit . Furthermore, a point y2I
with period kis said to be asymptotically stable if there exists such thatjFk(x) yj<jx yjfor all
x2(y ;y+).
The following lemma can be found in [15], which provides an algebraic criterion to verify the
stability of a periodic point.

4.1 Model 1
We start by considering the existence of periodic orbits with order two. Assume that there is a 2-cycle
orbitx7!y7!x, where7!stands for the iteration map (2). Thus, we have
y=x+f(e x3); x =y+f(e y3): (14)
Obviously, x6=yshould be guaranteed. Otherwise, x7!y7!xwill degenerate into an equilib-
rium. Then, the problem of determining the existence of 2-cycles is transformed into determining the
existence of real solutions of 8

>>>>:y=x+f(e x3);
x=y+f(e y3);
x6=y;
x>0; y> 0; e> 0; f > 0:(15)
Since the above system involves two variables xandy, the approach used in Section 3 (feasible
only for univariate systems) might not be directly employed herein.
Remark 2.However, we can transform system (15) equivalently into univariate systems based on its
triangular decomposition. Specically, the triangular decomposition method permits us to decompose
the equation part (14) into the following two triangular sets.
T11= [y x;x3 e];
T12= [y+fx3 x ef;f3x6 3f2x4 2ef3x3+ 3fx2+ 3ef2x+e2f3 2]:
Since the rst polynomial in T11isy x, which implies that x=y. Thus, the zeros of T11are not
of our concern. We only focus on T12, where the rst polynomial y+fx3 x efhas degree one
with respect to y. Therefore, one can directly solve y= fx3+x+efand substitute it into relative
inequalities of system (15). In short, system (15) can be equivalently transformed into the following
univariate system.
8
><
>:f3x6 3f2x4 2ef3x3+ 3fx2+ 3ef2x+e2f3 2 = 0;
 fx3+x+ef > 0;
x>0; e> 0; f > 0:
After that, the approach in Section 3 can be applied. The results show that the above system has two
real solutions if and only if 8 =27<e2f3<2. It is evident that these two real solutions belong to the
11same 2-cycle orbit because x;yare symmetric and can be replaced with each other. Therefore, there
exists at most one 2-cycle orbit in Model 1.
According to Lemma 3, to determine whether the discovered 2-cycle is stable, we consider (15)
together with the condition

dxd(y+f(e y3))
dy<1;
i.e.,(1 3fx2)(1 3fy2)<1:
The technique introduced in Remark 2 is needed to transform the system into a univariate one.
According to our calculations, the unique 2-cycle orbit is stable if and only if 729 e4f6 3294e2f3+
1664>0 or equivalently 8 =27< e2f3<(61 11p
17)=27. We collect the aforementioned results in
the following theorem.
Theorem 2. Model 1 has at most one 2-cycle orbit, which exists if
8=27<e2f3<2:
Furthermore, this unique 2-cycle is stable if
8=27<e2f3<61 11p

or approximately
0:2962962963 <e2f3<0:5794754859 :
The measurement of the magnitude of periodic orbits is economically interesting for it characterizes
the size of uctuations in dynamic economies. For a n-cycle orbit p17!p27!pn7!p1, a direct
denition of the magnitude measure is
d=jp1 p2j+jp2 p3j++jpn 1 pnj+jpn p1j:
However, to obtain better mathematical properties, we square each item and dene the magnitude
measure to be
d= (p1 p2)2+ (p2 p3)2++ (pn 1 pn)2+ (pn p1)2:
For a 2-cycle orbit x7!y7!xin Model 1, the magnitude measure becomes d= (x y)2+ (y x)2.
Thus, we have8

>:d (x y)2 (y x)2= 0;
 y+x+f(e x3) = 0;
 x+y+f(e y3) = 0:
Using the method of triangular decomposition, we decompose the solutions of the above system into
zeros of the following two triangular sets.
T21= [y x;x3 e;d];
T22= [y+x3f ef x;
(d2f3+ 4df2+ 4f)x2+ ( 6def3 12ef2)x+ 36e2f3 2f2d2 8fd 8;
f3d3 12f2d2 60fd+ 216e2f3 64 ]:
The rst polynomial y xinT21implies that x=y. Thus,T21is not of concern since it corresponds
to equilibria rather than 2-cycle orbits. We focus on the last polynomial f3d3 12f2d2 60fd+
216e2f3 64 inT22. By solving dfrom this polynomial, we obtain three solutions:

12where

8 4e2f3+ 4(e4f6 4e2f3)1=2:
Here, only the real solution d1is meaningful. Therefore, the magnitude measure of the unique 2-cycle

In the rest of this section, similar calculations as above are repeated. We omit these computation
details due to space limitations. Concerning 3-cycle orbits in Model 1, we need to count real solutions

Based on a series of computations, we derive the following theorem.

As the polynomials involved in the conditions of the existence and stability of 4-cycle orbits are
extremely complicated, we report below the obtained results in an approximate style.
Theorem 4. Model 1 has at most one 4-cycle orbit, which exists if
0:5794754859 <e2f3<1:237575627:
Furthermore, this unique 4-cycle is stable if
0:5794754859 <e2f3<0:6673871142 :
Figure 3 (a) depicts the phase diagram of the unique 4-cycle in Model 1 with e= 0:6 andf= 1:2.
Sincee2f3= 0:622082(0:5794754859 ;0:6673871142), this unique 4-cycle in Model 1 is asymptotically
stable according to Theorem 4. Actually, the horizontal coordinates of A;B;C;D , i.e.,x;y;z;w , are
the four points in the 4-cycle orbit. For the sake of simplicity, we connect A;B;C;D with lines and
use the simplied phase diagram as Figure 3 (b) to demonstrate periodic solutions in the rest of this
paper.

which is twice as large as that of the 2-cycle orbit.
The parameter plane of Model 1 is shown in Figure 4. One can see that the parameter region for
the stability of the unique equilibrium (2-cycle or 4-cycle orbit) constitutes a connected set. Moreover,
the three regions for the stability of the equilibrium, 2-cycle, and 4-cycle adjoin without any gap. In
the next subsection, one will nd that the topological structure of the parameter space of Model 2 is
much more complex than that of Model 1.

the parameter regions for the stability of the 4-cycle orbit, the 2-cycle orbit, and the equilibrium,
respectively.
Figure 5 depicts the two-dimensional bifurcation diagram of Model 1 for ( e;f)2[0:6;1:6][0:6;1:6].
For additional information regarding two-dimensional bifurcation diagrams, readers can refer to [13].
14In the numerical simulations of Figure 5, we set the initial state to be x(0) = 1:0. Parameter points
corresponding to periodic orbits with dierent orders are marked in dierent colors. For example,
parameter points are colored in dark red if the order is just one (equilibria) and are marked in black
if the order is greater than or equal to 24 (complex trajectories). In the case that the order is greater
than 24, the black points may be viewed as the parameter values where complex dynamics such as
chaos take place. Moreover, we also use black to mark those parameter points where the trajectories
diverge to1. One can see that Figure 5 conrms the theoretical results presented in Figure 4.
In Figure 5, the transitions between dierent types of periodic orbits can also be observed. One can
see that the equilibrium loses its stability through a series of period-doubling bifurcations as the value
ofeorfincreases. For example, along the line of e= 1:0, the unique stable equilibrium bifurcates
into a stable 2-cycle orbit at f= 0:6665, which further bifurcates into a 4-cycle orbit at f= 0:8339.
There is a stable 8-cycle orbit when f2(0:8744;0:8826). Finally, chaotic dynamics take place if the
value offis large enough. Additional details can be found in the one-dimensional bifurcation diagram
presented in Figure 6, where we x e= 1:0 and choose x(0) = 1:1 to be the initial state of iterations.

4.2 Model 2
The formulation (3) of Model 2 involves ve parameters, which might be particularly complex for
symbolic computations of searching periodic solutions. In what follows, we keep Kas the only pa-
rameter and assume that a= 3:6,b= 2:4,c= 0:6, andd= 0:05. This setting is meaningful and
has been discussed by several economists, e.g., Puu [26], Al-Hdaibat and others [1], Matsumoto and
Szidarovszky [22].

dx= 1 K(4:8 3:6x+ 0:6x2): (17)
According to our computations, the following theorem is obtained.
Theorem 5. In Model 2, the possible number of 2-cycle orbits is zero (no real solutions in system (16))
or three (six real solutions in system (16)). There exist three 2-cycle orbits if K > 5=3. Moreover,
two of them are stable if
5=3<K < (5p
5 5)=3;
or approximately
1:666666667<K < 2:060113296:
To measure the magnitude of a 2-cycle orbit x7!y7!x, we also use d= (x y)2+ (y x)2. The
method of triangular decomposition permits us to decompose the solutions of

where the last two polynomials Kd 24K 80 andKd 6K+ 10 inT33andT34are of our concern.
We conclude that d= (24K+ 80)=Kord= (6K 10)=K. One can see that two of the three 2-cycle
orbits possess the same magnitude.

Remark 3.As aforementioned, the border polynomial plays an important role. However, one can derive
that the properties of the border polynomial reported in Lemma 2 will retain if we use the squarefree
part of the border polynomial. The squarefree part SPof the border polynomial of (18)+(19) is
simpler, which is given in Appendix. In Theorem 6, m1;:::;m 4are the real roots of SP. A rigorous
style of writing Theorem 6 is to express the conditions using factors in SP. However, this would be
quite tedious. Since only one parameter, i.e., K, is involved in SP, the regions divided by zeros of
SPare indeed intervals and can be approximately described as in Theorem 6. However, it should be
noticed that the values of m1;:::;m 4can be made arbitrarily accurate if we want because the exact
expression of SPhas already been obtained.
Figure 7 depicts all the 3-cycle orbits in Model 2 with K= 3:3032(m3;m4), where the 6 unstable
cycles are marked in red and the 2 stable cycles are marked in blue. It is worth noting that two of
the unstable 3-cycle orbits in red almost coincide with the stable ones in blue, but they are dierent.
We should underline that this dynamic phenomenon, derived by symbolic computations, may be too
subtle to observe through numerical simulations.

In Figure 10, we plot all possible 5-cycle orbits in Model 2 with K= 3:332961832(m23;m24),

red, while the 2 stable ones are marked in blue.
By Theorems 6, 7 and 8, one can see the parameter space of Model 2 is quite dierent from
that of Model 1 in the sense that the stability regions for the 3-cycle, 4-cycle and 5-cycle orbits
are disconnected sets formed by many disjoint portions. Therefore, the topological structures of the
regions for stable periodic orbits in Model 2 are much more complex than those in Model 1. This may
be because the inverse demand function of Model 2 has an inection point. However, the following
observations of Model 2 are similar to Model 1. Theorem 5 shows that the stability region for the
2-cycles is a connected interval. In Model 2, the right boundary of the stability region for the 2-cycles
is the same as the left boundary of the stability region for the 4-cycles. When a= 3:6,b= 2:4,c= 0:6,
andd= 0:05, by Theorem 1 we know that Model 2 has stable equilibria if K2(0;5=3), which adjoins
the stability region for the 2-cycles. Moreover, in Model 2, the stability regions for cycles with distinct
periods may not intersect with each other, which means that multistability might only arise among
20periodic orbits with the same period.
Figure 11 depicts the two-dimensional bifurcation diagram of Model 2 for ( a;K)2[2:5;5:0]
[0:0;3:0]. We x the parameters b= 2:4,c= 0:6,d= 0:05, and set the initial state to be x(0) = 1:0.
Similarly, we use dierent colors to mark parameter points corresponding to trajectories with dierent
periods. Parameter points are marked in black if the corresponding orbits have orders greater than
24. Furthermore, we also use black to mark the parameter points where the trajectories diverge.
One can see that Figure 11 conrms the theoretical results reported in Theorem 1. However, Fig-
ure 11 generated by numerical simulations is not accurate compared to Figure 2 based on symbolic
computations.

x the parameters b= 2:4,c= 0:6,d= 0:05, and choose x(0) = 1:0 to be the initial state of the
iterations.
Figure 12 depicts the one-dimensional bifurcation diagrams of Model 2 with respect to Kby xing
a= 3:3,b= 2:4,c= 0:6, andd= 0:05. The bifurcation diagrams are dierent if the selected initial
states of the iterations are distinct. For example, in Figure 12 (a) and (b), the initial states are
selected to be x(0) = 1:0 andx(0) = 4:0, respectively. The dierence may be because two stable
equilibria exist when Kis relatively small and distinct initial states approach distinct equilibria. As
shown by Figure 12 (a), the trajectory converges to 1 :058 whenK < 1:1996 and converges to 4 :384
whenK > 1:9874. In Figure 12, the occurrence of period-doubling bifurcations can also be observed.
Figure 13 depicts the one-dimensional bifurcation diagrams of Model 2 with respect to aby xing
K= 2:2,b= 2:4,c= 0:6, andd= 0:05. In Figure 13 (a) and (b), the initial states of the iterations
are selected to be x(0) = 1:0 andx(0) = 4:0, respectively. Similarly, the two bifurcation diagrams are
dierent because of the selection of distinct initial states. Furthermore, pitchfork bifurcations can be
observed in Figure 13, where the number of stable equilibria changes from one to zero.
In Model 2, two stable equilibria may coexist (see the blue-gray region in Figure 2). The equilibrium
selection problem is interesting. The nal outcome of the iterations depends not only on the values of
21(a)x(0) = 1 :0.
 (b)x(0) = 4 :0.

22the parameters but also on the starting conditions of the game. According to our numerical simulations
of Model 2, the basins of attraction of coexisting equilibria have complicated structures. For example,
by xingK= 0:5,a= 3:5,b= 2:4,c= 0:6,d= 0:05, we have two stable equilibria E1= 1:19 and
E2= 4:64. The basin of E1is
B(E1) = (0;3:168)[(6:518;7:577)[(7:745;7:781)[(7:786;7:789);
while that of E2is
B(E2) = (3:168;6:518)[(7:577;7:745)[(7:781;7:786):
Furthermore, when the initial state x(0)>7:786, the trajectory will not converge to any of the two
stable equilibria but diverge to + 1. TakeK= 1 anda= 4 as the other example. If the other
parameters keep unchanged, i.e., b= 2:4,c= 0:6, andd= 0:05, there are two stable equilibria
E1= 4:99 andE2= 1:99. Our simulations show that the basins of these two equilibria are
B(E1) = (0;0:807)[(2:0;6:192)[(6:431;6:647)[(6:653;6:659);
and
B(E2) = (0:807;2:0)[(6:192;6:431)[(6:647;6:653);
respectively. The escape set is (6 :659;+1), where the trajectory diverges. In short, in Model 2, the
basins of the two stable equilibria are disconnected sets and have complex topological structures.
5 Chaotic Dynamics
In the bifurcation diagrams (Figures 6 and 12), one can observe that the dynamics of the two considered
models transition to chaos through period-doubling bifurcations as the adjustment speed increases.
From an economic point of view, if chaos appears, the pattern behind output and prots is nearly
impossible to learn even for completely rational players. Therefore, it is extremely hard for a rm to
handle a chaotic economy, where no market rules could be discovered and followed.
In this section, we rigorously prove the existence of chaos for the two models. The following
famous lemma was rst derived by Li and Yorke [15], which is mathematically deep and facilitates the
exploration of complicated dynamics arising in one-dimensional discrete dynamical systems.
Lemma 4. LetIbe an interval of real numbers, and let F:I!R be a continuous function. Assume
that there exists a point x2Isuch that
F3(x)x<F (x)<F2(x)orF3(x)x>F (x)>F2(x); (20)
then the following two statements are true.
1. For each k2f1;2;:::g, there is a point pk2Iwith period k, i.e.,Fk(pk) =pk, andFi(pk)6=pk
for1i<k .
2. There is an uncountable set SI(containing no periodic points), which satises the following
conditions:
(a) for any p;q2Swithp6=q,
lim sup
n!1jFn(p) Fn(q)j>0; (21)
and
lim inf
n!1jFn(p) Fn(q)j= 0; (22)
(b) for every point p2Sand every periodic point q2I,
lim sup
n!1jFn(p) Fn(q)j>0: (23)
23Remark 4.Eq. (22) means that every trajectory in Scan wander arbitrarily close to every other.
However, by (21) we know that no matter how close two distinct trajectories in Smay come to each
other, they must eventually wander away. Furthermore, by (23) it is clear that every trajectory in S
goes away from any periodic orbit in I. If the two statements in the above lemma are both satised,
we say that there exist chaotic dynamics or chaos in the sense of Li-Yorke.
Therefore, we can conclude that \period three implies chaos" for one-dimensional discrete dynam-
ical systems. In Section 4, we have rigorously derived the existence of 3-cycle orbits in Model 2 if
K > 2:417401607, which proves that chaos would arise for an uncountable set of initial states in the
sense of Li-Yorke.
But in Model 1, we have proved that there are no solutions with period three. However, it can
not be concluded that there exist no chaotic trajectories since the existence of period three is not
a necessary but only a sucient condition of chaos. In [20], Marotto indicated that the existence
of snapback repellers also implies chaos for general n-dimensional systems. However, Li and Chen
[14] pointed out that Marotto's original denition of snapback repeller may result in an insuciency,
and proposed the Marotto-Li-Chen Theorem. Thus, we give the following lemma for one-dimensional
systems by simplifying the Marotto-Li-Chen Theorem. Readers can refer to [11] for additional details.
Lemma 5. LetIbe an interval of real numbers, and let F:I!R be a dierentiable function. Assume
that
1.x2Iis an equilibrium, i.e., F(x) =x;
2. there exists a close interval SIsuch thatxis an inner point of S, and the derivative of F
has the absolute value greater than 1at every point p2S, i.e.,jF0(p)j>1;
3. for some integer m> 1, there exists a point y2Ssuch thaty6=x,Fm(y) =x, andF0(Fk(y))6=
0for all 1km.
Then the system x(t+ 1) =F(x(t))is chaotic in the sense of Li-Yorke.
For Model 1, we have F(x) =x+f(e x3) andF0(x) = 1 3fx2. ThenjF0(x)j>1 andx >0
imply that x>q
2
3f. Thus, if we can nd x;ywithx6=ysuch that bothjF0(x)j>1 andjF0(y)j>1
are satised, then there must exist one closed interval Scontaining x;yas inner points. In such a
case, it is obvious that jF0(p)j>1 for every point p2S. Naturally, we start from m= 2 to verify the
conditions of Lemma 5 by counting real solutions of the following system.
8
>>>>>>>>>>>><
>>>>>>>>>>>>:x=x+f(e x3);
x=F2(y) =y+f(e y3) +f(e (y+f(e y3))3);
j1 3fx2j>1;
j1 3fy2j>1;
j1 3f(y+f(e y3))2j6= 0;
x6=y;
x>0; y> 0; e> 0; f > 0:
The technique introduced in Remark 2 should be conducted rst to transform the above system into
a univariate one. According to our calculations, the above system has at least one real solution if and
only if 8=27<e2f3<64=27. Therefore, we conclude that Model 1 is chaotic in the sense of Li-Yorke
provided that 8 =27<e2f3<64=27.
6 Concluding Remarks
It is known that a monopoly may exhibit complex dynamics such as periodic orbits and chaos al-
though it is the simplest oligopoly. In this study, we investigated two monopoly models with gradient
mechanisms, where the monopolists are knowledgeable rms. The two models are distinct mainly in
24their inverse demand functions. Model 1 uses the inverse demand function of Naimzada and Ricchiuti
[25], while Model 2 employs that of Puu [26]. Dierent from widely applied numerical methods such
as numerical simulations and bifurcation continuation approaches, symbolic methods were applied in
this paper to analyze the local stability, periodic solutions, and even chaotic dynamics. Numerical
methods have some shortcomings, e.g., the computations may encounter the problem of instability,
which makes the results completely useless. In comparison, symbolic computations are exact, thus the
obtained results can be used to rigorously prove economic theorems in some sense.
By reproving the already-known results (Proposition 1) of the local stability and bifurcations
of Model 1, we explained in detail how our symbolic approach works. Afterward, the analysis of the
stability and bifurcations of Model 2 was conducted based on this approach. We acquired the complete
conditions of the local stability and bifurcations of Model 2 for the rst time (see Theorem 1). In
Figure 2, it was observed that Model 2 behaves quite dierently from typical oligopoly models with
gradient mechanisms. For example, even if the adjustment speed Kis quite large, there always exist
some values of a(the dierence between the initial commodity price and the initial marginal cost)
such that Model 2 has a stable equilibrium. Moreover, Model 2 may go from instability to stability
and then back to instability twice as the value of aincreases.
From an economic point of view, the study of periodic solutions is of practical importance. Under
the assumption of bounded rationality, rms can not learn the pattern behind output and prots if
periodic dynamics take place. For the two models, we explored the periodic solutions with lower orders
as well as their local stability. Dierences between the two models were found, e.g., 3-cycle orbits exist
in Model 2 but not in Model 1. In Model 1, the parameter region for the stability of the periodic
solution with a xed order constitutes a connected set. In Model 2, however, the stability regions for
the 3-cycle, 4-cycle, and 5-cycle orbits are disconnected sets formed by many disjoint portions. In other
words, the topological structures of the regions for stable periodic orbits in Model 2 are much more
complex than those in Model 1. The above dierences may be because the inverse demand function of
Model 2 has an inection point. According to the numerical simulations of Model 2, we found that the
basins of the two stable equilibria are disconnected sets and also have complex topological structures.
For an-cycle orbit p17!p27!pn7!p1, we dened the magnitude measure to be
d= (p1 p2)2+ (p2 p3)2++ (pn 1 pn)2+ (pn p1)2:
For the two considered models, we analytically investigated the formulae for the magnitude of periodic
orbits with lower orders.
Furthermore, it is extremely hard for a rm to handle an economy when chaos appears. In such
a case, no market rules can be discovered and followed, and the pattern behind output and prots
is nearly impossible to learn even for completely rational players. In the bifurcation diagrams of the
two models, it seems that chaos occurs when the adjustment speed is large enough. We claried this
observation analytically. By virtue of the fact \period three implies chaos", we derived that Model 2
is chaotic in the sense of Li-Yorke by proving the existence of 3-cycle orbits. However, there are no
3-cycles in Model 1, but the Marotto-Li-Chen Theorem permitted us to prove the existence of chaos
by nding snapback repellers.
In this paper, we take the assumption of knowledgeable players, which means the enterprise has
full information regarding the inverse demand function and can compute its marginal prot at any
time. In the real world, however, it is more reasonable to assume players to be limited rather than
knowledgeable. In this case, the enterprise does not know the form of the inverse demand function,
but possesses the values of output and price only in the past periods and estimates its marginal prot
with a simple dierence formula. The investigation of the dynamics of limited rms might be an
important direction for our future study.
