Abstract. We study geometric monodromy groups Ggeom,Fqof the local systems Fqon the aﬃne
line over F2of rankD=√q(q−1),q= 22n+1, constructed in [Ka5]. The main result of the paper
shows that Ggeom,Fqis either the Suzuki simple group2B2(q), or the special linear group SL D.
We also show that F8has geometric monodromy group2B2(8), and arithmetic monodromy group
Aut(2B2(8)) over F2, thus establishing [Ka5, Conjecture 2.2] in full in the case q= 8.

be the Suzuki group Sz( q) :=2B2(q), q= 22n+1, in one of its two lowest dimensional nontrivial irre-
ducible representations. These representations, complex conjugates of each other, are of dimension
2n(22n+1−1) and have traces in Z[i], the Gaussian integers.
The deﬁnition involved p-Witt vectors of length 2 for p= 2, with values in F2-algebras. We
identifyW2(F2) withZ/4Z, by the map [ a,b]/ma√s⊔o→a2+ 2b, with the usual convention that we ﬁrst
lifta,btoZand then reduce a2+2bmodulo 4. We take the additive character of Z/4Zgiven by
n/ma√s⊔o→in, and view it as the additive character ψ2:W2(F2)→µ4(Z[i]) given by
ψ2([a,b]) :=ia2+2b.
Attached to a Witt vector of length 2 with coeﬃcients in F2[x], say [a(x),b(x)], is the Artin-
Schreier-Witt sheaf Lψ2([a(x),b(x)])onA1/F2. It is lisse of rank one, and its trace function is given
as follows. For k/F2a ﬁnite extension, and x∈k,
Trace(Frob x,k|Lψ2([a(x),b(x)])) =ψ2(TraceW2(k)/W2(F2)([a(x),b(x)]).
If instead we take a(x),b(x)∈k0[x] for some ﬁnite extension k0/F2, then the Artin-Schreier-Witt
sheafLψ2([a(x),b(x)])is lisse of rank one on A1/k0, and fork/k0a ﬁnite extension and x∈k, the trace
of Frobx,kis given by the same formula (which only makes sense when kis an extension of k0).
The unique nontrivial additive character ψofF2is related to ψ2by the formula
ψ(b) =ψ2([0,b]);
this is simply the identity ( −1)b=i2b.
Under Witt vector addition, [ a,b] = [a,0]+[0,b]. Thus we have the factorization
Lψ2([a(x),b(x)])=Lψ2([a(x),0])⊗Lψ(b(x)).
When both a(x) andb(x) are polynomials of degree prime to p= 2,Lψ2([a(x),0])has Swan con-
ductorSwan∞=pdeg(a(x)), whileLψ(b(x))hasSwan∞= deg(b(x)). So in this case, Lψ2([a(x),b(x)])
hasSwan∞= max(pdeg(a(x)),deg(b(x))).
Quite generally, for an Artin-Schreier-Witt sheaf L:=Lψ2([a(x),b(x)])onA1/k0with Swan conduc-
torSwan∞=n≥2, its Fourier transform FT ψ(L) onA1/k0is anAiry sheaf in the sense of ˇSuch
[Such]. It is lisse of rank n−1, and all its∞-slopes aren
n−1. It is pure of weight one. Its trace
function is given as follows: for k/k0a ﬁnite extension, and t∈k,
Trace(Frob t,k|FTψ(L)) =−/summationdisplay
x∈kψ2/parenleftbig
TraceW2(k)/W2(F2)([a(x),b(x) +tx])/parenrightbig
.
Some key facts about Airy sheaves and their monodromy groups are due to ˇSuch [Such], and are
fundamental for the investigations reported on here.
We now turn to the Suzuki “candidates” of [Ka5]. Here
n≥1,q0:= 2n, q:= 2q2
0, t(q) :=q+1−2q0.
We take the Witt vector
[xt(q),n/summationdisplay
i=1x(1+2i)t(q)],
form the Artin-Schreier-Witt sheaf
L:=Lψ2([xt(q),/summationtextn
i=1x(1+2i)t(q)]),LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 3
form its FT ψ(L), and twist by the constant ﬁeld twist (1
1−(−1)ni)deg, to arrive at the local system
FqonA1/F2, whose trace function is given as follows. For k/F2a ﬁnite extension, and t∈k,
Trace(Frob t,k|Fq) =−1

x∈kψ2/parenleftbig
TraceW2(k)/W2(F2)([xt(q),n/summationdisplay
i=1x(1+2i)t(q)+tx])/parenrightbig
.
A key fact about Fqis that the input Witt vector [ xt(q),/summationtextn
i=1x(1+2i)t(q)] is a function of xt(q). So
in the trace formula for Fq, if we restrict to t/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 0 and make the substitution x/ma√s⊔o→x/t, the formula
becomes
Trace(Frob t,k|Fq) =−1
/parenleftbig

tt(q),n/summationdisplay
i=1x(1+2i)t(q)
t(1+2i)t(q)+x])/parenrightbig
,
which is a function of tt(q). ThusFq|Gmhas a descent to a lisse sheaf GqonGm/F2whose trace
function is given by
Trace(Frob t,k|Fq) =−1
/parenleftbig

,
and such that under the t(q) Kummer pullback,
[t(q)]⋆Gq=Fq|Gm.
For the case n= 1, i.e. for2B2(8), we prove in Theorem 6.1 that F8has the predicted geometric
monodromy group Ggeom,F8=2B2(8) and arithmetic monodromy group Garith,F8,F2= Aut(2B2(8))
overF2, and thus establish [Ka5, Conjecture 2.2] in full in this cas e. For each n≥1, we show
thatGgeom,Fqis either2B2(q) or SLDforD= rank(Fq) =q0(q−1). A (huge) calculation of fourth
moment forF8shows that Ggeom,F8cannot be SL 14. It remains an open problem to prove (or
disprove) that each FqhasGgeom,Fq=2B2(q) whenq≥32.
In fact, we show in Theorem 8.4 that we have such a dichotomy of possible geometric monodromy
groupsGgeom, either2B2(q) or SLD, D=q0(q−1), for a general class of local systems of “the
same shape” asFq(see Remark 8.6 and Theorem 9.18 for examples of such local sy stems with
Ggeom= SLD). Key to our investigation is the fact that these sheaves all satisfy the condition ( S+)
of [KT1, Deﬁnition 1.2]. Somewhat to our surprise, the most d iﬃcult part of establishing condition
(S+) was to show the sheaves in question are geometrically prim itive, i.e. that the representation of
theirGgeomis not induced. Our proof utilizes the existence of primitiv e prime divisors of the integer
t(q), cf. Theorem 3.4. We give a second proof which will be useful in future studies of geometric
monodromy groups of quite general Airy sheaves. Condition ( S+) implies that for each of these
sheaves, either Ggeomis a ﬁnite, almost quasisimple group, or has G◦
geomacting irreducibly. This
initial dichotomy, plus a substantial group-theoretic ana lysis, in which Theorem 4.5 plays a key
role, is what leads to the2B2(q)/SLDdichotomy. Pursuing the study of primitive prime divisors,
we prove in Theorems 3.4, 3.7, and Corollary 3.5 the existenc e of primitive prime divisors in the
orders of maximal tori of the Suzuki-Ree groups2B2(q),2G2(q), and2F4(q). We also extend in §7 the
classiﬁcation of low-dimensional representations of clas sical groups in characteristic p≥0, beyond
the bounds in [KlL] and [Lu]. These results will be useful in o ther situations as well. Finally, the
structure of arithmetic monodromy groups, assuming ﬁniten ess, is determined in Theorem 9.14.
1.Descents of Suzuki candidates and moment calculations
For each odd power q= 22n+1of 2, starting with q= 8, the ﬁnite simple group2B2(q) has
two (complex conjugate) lowest dimensional nontrivial irr educible representations, of dimension4 ALP¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
d(q) :=q0(q−1), withq0:= 2n. In each case we have a factorization
1+d(q) = (q0+1)t(q) witht(q) :=q+1−2q0.
In [Ka5], for each such qthere is proposed an Airy sheaf in the sense of ˇSuch [Such], call it Fq
onA1/F2which is lisse of rank d(q) and with Swan∞(Fq) = 1 +d(q). ItsI(∞)-representation is
irreducible of dimension d(q), with all∞-slopes1+d(q)
d(q). Moreover,Fqis given [Ka5, Section 4] with
an explicit descent to a lisse sheaf GqonGm/F2whose Kummer pullback by t(q)thpower is (the
restriction to Gm/F2of)Fq:
[t(q)]⋆Gq∼=Fq|Gm.
ThusGqis lisse on Gm/F2, tame at 0 with I(0)-representation a direct sum of Kummer characters
of order dividing t(q), and whose I(∞)-representation is irreducible of dimension d(q), with all
∞-slopesq0+1
d(q)=q0+1
q0(q−1).
Next we give a slight improvement of [KRLT2, Theorem 6.5].
Theorem 1.1. LetH0be a lisse sheaf on Gm/Fqwhich is tame at 0and pure of weight zero. Let
a,bbe nonnegative integers, and consider the moment Ma,b. Denote by
Ha,b
0:=H⊗a
0⊗(H∨

Denote byA,B,C,D the following constants.
C:= dimension of the space of I(0)-invariants inHa,b
0,
D:= dimension of the space of I(∞)-invariants inHa,b
0,
B:=Swan∞(Ha,b
0)+Ma,b,
A:=B+Ma,b−C−D.
Then we have the following estimate./vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1

WhenFis tame at 0, the Euler-Poincar´ e formula gives
Swan∞(F) =h1
c−h2

To compute the dimension of H1
c(wt = 1), we use the fact that for the inclusion j:Gm⊂P1, the
groupH1(P1/Fq,j⋆F) is pure of weight one. We exploit this by looking at the short exact sequence
of sheaves on P1/Fqgiven by
0→j!F→j⋆F→(FI(0))0⊕(FI(∞))∞→0,LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 5
where the last two summands are skyscraper sheaves at 0 and ∞. The group
H2(P1/Fq,j⋆F) =H2
c(Gm/Fq,F)
is the Tate-twisted group of πgeom
1co-invariants inF, but asFis pure, the action of πgeom
1is
semisimple, so this is also the (Tate-twisted) group of πgeom
1invariants. The group
H0(P1/Fq,j⋆F) =H0(Gm/Fq,F)
is the space of πgeom
1invariants inF, so has dimension h0=h2
c. Consider the long exact sequence
0→H0(P1/Fq,j⋆F)→FI(0)⊕FI(∞)→H1
c(Gm/Fq,F)→H1(P1/Fq,j⋆F0)→0.
Apply it withFtaken to beHa,b

Thus we have the equalities

c(wt = 1) = h1
c+h0−dimFI(0)−dimFI(∞)=A,

c(wt≤0) =B−A.

We will now apply this estimate to the descent G8toGm/F2of the lisse sheaf F8onA1/F2.
Recall from [Ka5, §2] thatF8is the Fourier transform of the Artin-Schreier-Witt sheaf Lψ2([x5,x15]),
with a constant ﬁeld twist by1
1+i. Thus fork/F2a ﬁnite extension, and t∈k,
Trace(Frob t,k|F8) =−(1
1+i)deg(k/F2)/summationdisplay
x∈kψ2(TraceW2(k)/W2(F2)([x5,x15+tx])).
The descentG8is the lisse sheaf on Gm/F2whose trace function is given as follows. For k/F2a
ﬁnite extension, and t∈k×,
Trace(Frob t,k|G8) =−(1
1+i)deg(k/F2)/summationdisplay
x∈kψ2(TraceW2(k)/W2(F2)([x5/t,x15/t3+x])).
Thus one visibly has, for t∈k×, the identity
Trace(Frob t,k|F8) = Trace(Frob t5,k|G8),
simply by the substitution x/ma√s⊔o→x/tin the formula for F8.
In any extension ﬁeld k/F2such that gcd(5 ,#k×) = 1, the map t/ma√s⊔o→t5is bijective on k×. Such
k/F2are precisely those whose degree over F2is not divisible by 4. For such a k/F2, the traces
Trace(Frob t,k|G8) astruns overk×are precisely the traces Trace(Frob t,k|F8) astruns overk×. An
extensive calculation shows that over F×
218, the seven traces which occur, with their multiplicities,
are
•−2i, multiplicity 16256,
•−2, multiplicity 4095,6 ALP¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
•−1, multiplicity 52429,
•0, multiplicity 112347,
•1, multiplicity 60495,
•2i, multiplicity 16512,
•14, multiplicity 9.
[We have not been able to ﬁnd any conceptual explanation for t he multiplicities of these traces, let
alone for the fact that all traces are algebraic integers. Ha d we known that the traces of all Frobenii
over all ﬁnite extensions of F2are algebraic integers, we would have been able to conclude t hatG8
has ﬁnite geometric monodromy group Ggeom, and the proof of the main result Theorem 6.1 would
have been much simpler.]
This computation was carried out using Magma 2.26-6 [BCP] at the University of Auckland. It
exploited a new feature of Magma which supports running tasks in parallel on multiple proces sors:
each task performed the necessary computation for a given t∈k×. Using 55 3.0GHz processors,
the computation completed in 5.75 days, taking about 7500 ho urs of CPU time.
The empirical M2,2forG8overF×
218is thus approximately 3.99963378766551080898593515753.
Applying Theorem 1.1, we ﬁnd
Corollary 1.2. For the lisse sheaf G8onGm/F2,M2,2>2.
Proof.The sheafF8is a geometrically irreducible Airy sheaf, lisse on A1/F2of rank 14, whose I(∞)
representation is irreducible, with all slopes 15 /14. Its descentG8is thus lisse and geometrically
irreducible on Gm, itsI(0) representation is the direct sum with multiplicities of the characters of
order dividing 5, and its I(∞) representation is irreducible, with all slopes 3 /14.
Let us denote by
K:= (G8)⊗2⊗(G∨
8)⊗2.
In the proof of Theorem 1.1, the estimate
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/summationdisplay
t∈F×
qTrace(Frob t,Fq|K)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤qh2
c+√qh1

x∈F×
qTrace(Frob u,Fq|K)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤qh2
c+√qh1
c(wt = 1)+ h1
c.
The equality
h1
c(wt = 1) = Swan∞(K)+2M2,2−dimKI(0)−dimKI(∞)
can be weakened to
h1
c(wt = 1)≤Swan∞(K)+M2,2−dimKI(0),
simply because in the exact sequence, the space H0of global invariants of Kinjects into the space
KI(∞)ofI(∞)-invariants.
ThusKislisseon Gm, itsI(0) representation isthedirectsumwithmultiplicities of thecharacters
of order dividing 5, and all its I(∞) slopes are≤3/14.So we have the crude estimate
Swan∞(K)≤rank(K)(biggest slope)≤144(3/14) = 8232.
TheI(0) representation of Kis End(End(the I(0)-representation of G8)).
We now turn to the I(0) representation of G8. The action of I(0) is through µ5. So in terms of
a ﬁxed character χof order 5, it is a direct sum
a1+bχ+cχ2+dχ3+eχ4,LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 7
with non-negative integers a,b,c,d,e which sum to 14. We also know from Deligne’s “independence
ofℓ” result [De2, Theorem 9.8] or from Serre-Tate [Se-Ta, Theor em 2(ii)], that the character of this
representation of I(0) has values in the ﬁeld Q(i) (becauseG8is part of a compatible system over
Q(i)). On the other hand, this character has values in Q(ζ5). But the intersection Q(i)∩Q(ζ5) is
justQ, so the trace has values in Q. In other words, the quantity
a+bζ5+cζ2
5+dζ3
5+eζ4
5
lies inQ. This in turn forces b=c=d=e, and soa+bζ5+bζ2
5+bζ3
5+bζ4
5=a−b. Buta+4b= 14,
so there are only four possibilities for the character, name ly
21+3χ+3χ2+3χ3+3χ4, ,61+2χ+2χ2+2χ3+2χ4,101+1χ+1χ2+1χ3+1χ4,141.
More intrinsically, let us denote by Regthe regular representation of µ5:
Reg=1+χ+χ2+χ3+χ4.
Then theI(0) representation of G8is one of
−1+3Reg,41+2Reg,91+Reg,141.
Because the character takes real (in fact integer) values, d imKI(0)is the coeﬃcient of 1in the fourth
power of the character. For each of our four candidates, this is easily computed by hand, because
Reg2= 5Reg,Reg3= 52Reg,Reg4= 53Reg. The least of the possible values of dim KI(0)is 7684,
the value attained by the candidate −1+3Reg. So the weakened estimate becomes
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/summationdisplay
t∈F×
218Trace(Frob t,F218|K)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤218M2,2+(8232+M2,2−7684)29+(8232+M2,2).
Dividing by 218−1, we get
3.999≤218
218−1M2,2+(548+M2,2)29
218−1+8232+M2,2

Here 218−1 = 262143, and 29/(218−1)≤(29+1)/(218−1) = 1/(29−1) = 1/511.
Thus ifM2,2were 2, we would get
3.999≤(1+(1/262143))2 +550 /511+8332/262143,
which is nonsense. /square
2.Background results on determinants, rationality, and slope s
Theorem 2.1. Letpbe a prime, k/Fpa ﬁnite extension, ν≥1an integer, andFa lisseQℓ
sheaf on a smooth, geometrically connected scheme U/kwhich is pure of weight zero and part of
a compatible system of lisse sheaves on Uwhose trace functions take values in Q(ζpν). Denote by
Ggeom≤Gariththe geometric and arithmetic monodromy groups of F. Then we have the following
results.
(i) det(Garith)has ﬁnite order dividing 2pνifpis odd, dividing 2νifp= 2.
(ii) det(Ggeom)has ﬁnite order dividing 2pνifpis odd, dividing 2νifp= 2.
(iii)Suppose that Uis a dense open set of P1, and that at each point x∈P1(k)\U(k), allI(x)-slopes
ofFare<1. Thendet(Ggeom)has order dividing 2, and is trivial if p= 2.
Proof.(i) For any ﬁnite extension L/kand any point t∈U(L), det(Frob t,L|F) lies inQ(ζpν). It has
absolute value 1 at every archimedean place of Q(ζpν) (purity of weight zero), and is a λ-adic unit
at every ﬁnite place λof residue characteristic /\⌉}a⊔io\slash=p(being part of a compatible system). Because
Q(ζpν) has a unique place above p, the product formula tells us that this determinant is a unit at8 ALP¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
all ﬁnite places. Thus it is a root of unity in Q(ζpν), so of order dividing 2 pνforpodd, and of order
dividing 2νifp= 2.
AsGgeomis a subgroup of Garith, we trivially obtain (ii).
To prove (iii), the slope hypotheses imply that det as a chara cter ofGgeomhas slope<1, hence
0, at each missing point, and thus is everywhere tame, and hen ce (being on a dense open set of P1)
has order prime to p. /square
Theorem 2.2. Letpbe a prime, k/Fpa ﬁnite extension, ν≥1an integer, andFa lisseQℓ
sheaf on a smooth, geometrically connected scheme U/kwhich is pure of weight zero and part of
a compatible system of lisse sheaves on Uwhose trace functions take values in a number ﬁeld E.
Suppose further that there exists a proper smooth curve with geometrically connected ﬁbres
π:C→U,
a ﬁnite group Γof automorphisms of C/U, and a linear character
χ: Γ→E×
suchFis isomorphic to the χ-component of R1π⋆(Qℓ). Then we have the following results.
(i)For any ﬁnite extension L/kand any point t∈U(L), the action of Frobt,L|Fis semisimple.
(ii)IfUis a curve, with complete nonsingular model X, then for each point x∈X(k)\U(k), the
character of the action of the inertia group I(x)acting onFhas values in K.
Proof.The semisimplicity of Frobenii on H1of curves goes back to Weil. By Serre-Tate [Se-Ta,
Theorem 2(ii)], the character of I(x) onR1π⋆(Qℓ) has values in Z. When we project the I(x) action
onto theχcomponent, the character of the resulting I(x) action has values in Q(χ), a subﬁeld of
K. /square
Remark 2.3. Theorem 2.2 applies to the Airy sheaves of ˇSuch [Such] and any of their descents,
where the family of curves in question is a family of Artin-Sc hreier-Witt coverings of A1(compact-
iﬁed by adding its one point at ∞).
Next we record a general result on Ggeomof lisse sheaves on open sets of A1:
Theorem 2.4. LetUbe adense open set of A1/Fp, andFa lisseQℓ-sheaf onU, withℓ/\⌉}a⊔io\slash=p. Suppose
all the∞-slopes ofFare at most σ, for some 0<σ<1. Suppose the geometric monodromy group
G=GgeomofFadmits a representation Φ :G→GLd(F)over some algebraically closed ﬁeld Fof
characteristic/\⌉}a⊔io\slash=p, of dimension d<1/σ. ThenΦis tame at∞.
Proof.The hypothesis that all ∞-slopes ofFare≤σis that for all y > σ, the upper numbering
subgroupI(∞)yacts trivially onF, i.e. dies in Ggeom, and hence dies under Φ. Thus all ∞-slopes
ofFare≤σ, and hence Swan∞(Φ)≤dσ <1. As Swan conductors are non-negative integers,
Swan∞(Φ) = 0. This means P(∞) acts trivially in Φ, i.e. Φ is tame at ∞. /square
Now we prove a generalization of [KT1, Theorem 4.16]:
Theorem 2.5. LetUbe a dense open set of A1/Fp,Fa lisseQℓ-sheaf onU, withℓ/\⌉}a⊔io\slash=p, and let
Gbe the geometric monodromy group of H. Suppose that the following hold:
(a)All∞-slopes ofHare at most σfor some 0<σ<1, andHis not tame at∞;
(b)Gis a ﬁnite almost quasisimple group: S✁G/Z(G)≤Aut(S)for some ﬁnite non-abelian simple
groupS;
(c)For some normal subgroup RofG/Z(G)containingS,Radmits either a faithful d-dimensional
linear representation
Φ :R→GLd(F),LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 9
or ane-dimensional projective representation
Ψ :R→PGLe(F)
which is nontrivial over S, over some algebraically closed ﬁeld Fof characteristic/\⌉}a⊔io\slash=p.
Then
1/σ≤d·[G/Z(G) :R]≤d·|Out(S)|,
respectively
1/σ≤(e2−1)·[G/Z(G) :R]≤(e2−1)·|Out(S)|.
Proof.Note that the given Ψ is faithful. Indeed, Ker(Ψ) ✁Rdoes not contain S, so it intersects
Strivially by simplicity of S. Because both Sand Ker(Ψ) are normal in R, the commutator
[S,Ker(Ψ)]⊂S∩Ker(Ψ) = 1. Thus Ker(Ψ) ≤CR(S)≤CAut(S)(S) = 1. Hence Ris embedded
in PGL(U), whereU=Fe. Composing this embedding with the faithful action of PGL( U) on
End0(U) = End(U)/scalars, we obtain a faithful action of Ron a module of dimension ≤e2−1.
Thus it suﬃces to prove the bound 1 /σ≤d·[G/Z(G) :R] when Φ :R→GL(V) is given.
So assume the contrary: Φ : R→GL(V) is faithful for some Vwith dim(V) =d, but
(2.5.1) 1 /σ>d·[G/Z(G) :R].
Let˜Vdenote the ¯G-module Ind¯G
R(V) for¯G:=G/Z(G). Note that ¯Gacts faithfully on ˜V. Indeed,
letK✁¯Gdenote the kernel of the action of ¯Gon˜V. By the construction of Vas the induced
representation, the R-module ˜VcontainsVas a submodule. But Sacts faithfully on V, hence
S∩K= 1. AsS✁¯G, it follows that [ S,K] = 1, and so
K≤C¯G(S)≤CAut(S)(S) = 1.
We also note that
dim(˜V) = [¯G:R]·dim(V) =d·[¯G:R]<1/σ
by (2.5.1).
Now view ˜Vas a representation of G, of dimension <1/σ. By Theorem 2.4, this representation
is tame at∞. Thus the image QinGofP(∞) acts trivially on ˜V. ButG/Z(G) acts faithfully
on˜V. Therefore Qlands in Z(G). Recall that I(∞) has ﬁnite image JinG, andJ/Qis cyclic.
AsQ≤Z(J), it follows that Jis abelian. Thus all simple J-summands inHare one-dimensional,
and at least one of them is wild, as His not tame at∞. Each one-dimensional wild component
hasSwana strictly positive integer, which is also its slope, contra dicting the hypothesis that all
∞-slopes ofHare<1. /square
3.Primitive prime divisors for Suzuki-Ree groups
The order of a ﬁnite group of Lie type G(Fq) over a ﬁeld Fqis usually a product of a power
ofq=pf(pthe deﬁning characteristic) and the values at qof cyclotomic polynomial Φ m(q) for
variousm. In a number of problems on G(Fq), the existence of primitive prime divisors ppd( q,m)
or ppd(p,mf) for certain mwas helpful. Recall [Zs] that for a,m∈Z≥2, aprimitive prime divisor
ℓ= ppd(a,m) is a prime divisor of am−1 that does not divide/producttextm−1
i=1(ai−1); such a prime divisor
always exists unless ( a,m) = (2,6) orm= 2 anda+ 1 is a 2-power. For the Suzuki-Ree groups
2B2(q) withq= 2n, 2∤n≥3,2G2(q) withq= 3n, 2∤n≥3, and2F4(q) withq= 2n, 2∤n≥3, some
factor Φm(q) of|G(Fq)|decomposes further into values at√qof polynomials over Z[√
2] orZ[√
3].

divisors ppd( p,4n), respectively ppd( p,6n), ppd(p,12n), whose existence does not follow from [Zs].
The main results of this section establish the existence of s uch prime divisors for Suzuki-Ree groups.

Ifd|n, then gcd( d,m) = 1, so we can ﬁnd 1 ≤e≤m−1 such that de≡1(modm). Now write
every 1≤k≤nwithd|kask=dlwith 1≤l≤n/d. Then the condition that k≡a(modm)
is equivalent to l≡ea(modm), in which case we can write l=s+miwith 0≤r≤m−1,
ea≡r(modm), andi∈Z. To count the number N(a,d) ofioccurring, write n/d=qm+rwith
0≤r≤m−1 andq∈Z≥0. Certainly, every 0 ≤i≤q−1 works, but neither i=−1 nori=q+1
can occur. It follows that
(3.1.2) n/md−1<q≤N(a,d)≤q+1<n/md +1.
We also note by [MNZ, (4.1)] that φ(n) =/summationtext
d|nµ(d)n/dand that/summationtext
d|n|µ(d)|is the number of

We will also need the following analogue of Proposition 3.1:
Proposition 3.2. Letn∈Z≥1be an odd integer divisible by 3. For any integer 0≤a≤11coprime

d|n,3∤dµ(d)N(a,d).
Next,µ(d) = 0 if 9|d, andµ(d) =−µ(d/3) if 3|d. It follows from [MNZ, (4.1)] that

Ifd|nand 3∤d, then gcd( d,12) = 1, so we can ﬁnd 1 ≤e≤11 such that de≡1(mod 12). The
proof of (3.1.2) repeated verbatim shows that
n/12d−1<q≤N(a,d)≤q+1<n/12d+1.
Combining with (3.2.1) and (3.2.2), this yields

In the rest of the proof of (3.3.1), we may assume that p1= 3. First suppose that s≥4. As

n/φ(n) = (3·5·7)/(2·4·6)<n1/7.
Also, ifn/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 105,165,195, thenφ(n)≥2·6·10>22.2s.
Suppose now that s= 2. Ifp2≥13, thenn/φ(n)≤(3/2)·(13/12)<(3·13)1/7≤n1/7. If

n/φ(n) = (3/2)·(5/4)<(6·3·5)1/7<n1/7. Also, ifn/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 15,21,33,45, thenφ(n)≥24>22.2s.
Finally, assume that s= 1, andn= 3awitha≥3. Thenn/φ(n) = 3/2<3a/7=n1/7, and

Nowg′(t) = log(A)/4−log(B)/(1.1t6/11)−(7/6t) is increasing, so g′(t)≥g′(847)>0.13 when

Proof.(i) The second statement is obvious for n≤5; also note that t(2) = 1,t(8) = 5. Henceforth
we may assume n≥7. Consider the sets
Aj:={1≤k≤4n|gcd(k,2n) = 1, k≡j(mod 8)},

and the map k/ma√s⊔o→k+4nyields bijections

fora= 1,3, we have Φ 8n(X) = Φ8n,1(X)Φ8n,3(X). Next, since

(3.4.6) P2,1(n)P2,3(n) = Φ4n(2).
(iii) To show that P2,1(n) andP2,3(n) are integers, we use gcd(8 ,n) = 1 to write 1 = ns+ 8t
for somes,t∈Zwith gcd(s,8) = gcd(t,n) = 1, and set ζ=ζ8n=αβwithα:=ζns, a 8throot

k(modn) runs over units in Z/nZ, each at most once. Using (3.4.2), we see that each unit is met

it is an integer.
Using this norm interpretation for P2,1(n) andP2,3(n), a calculation with Magma shows that
P2,a(n)>2nfor odd integers 7 ≤n≤2601. Together with Proposition 3.3, this shows that
(3.4.7) P2,a(n)>2n

Certainly, any root of X4n+1 isζkfor some odd integer 1 ≤k<8n. Ifk≡±1(mod 8), then
f−(ζk) = exp(kπi/2) +1−√
2exp(kπi/4) = 0.
Similarly, if k≡±3(mod 8), then
f+(ζk) = exp(kπi/2) +1+√
2exp(kπi/4) = 0.

P2,1(n) dividest−(q). Similarly, P2,3(n) dividest+(q).
(v) By (3.4.7), P2,1(n)>n. Consider any prime divisor ℓofP2,1(n), which then divides t−(q) by
the result of (iv), and divides Φ 4n(2) by (3.4.6). Suppose that ℓis not a primitive prime divisor of
24n−1. By [Lun, Satz 1] (cf. [Ro, Proposition 2]) ℓ|n, and moreover ℓ2∤Φ4n(2). It follows that the
ℓ-part ofP2,1(n) isℓ. Hence, ift−(q) is not divisible by any primitive prime divisor of 24n−1, then
P2,1(n) dividesn, a contradiction.
The proof for t+(q) is entirely similar. /square

Proposition 3.6. If2∤n≥3anda= 1,5, thenP3,a(n)>2n.
Proof.A computation with Mathematica shows that P3,a(n)>2nwhen 3≤n≤353. Now assume
thatn≥354. By (3.3.1) m:=φ(n)≥n6/7>153, som≥154, and 2ω(n)≤m5/11.
Fixa∈ {1,5}and letRj:={(j−1)n≤k < jn|gcd(k,12n) = 1,k≡a(mod 12)}for
0≤j≤11. For each j, observe that k∈Rjif and only if 0≤k′:=k−jn<nis coprime to nand
k′≡a−jn(mod 12). If 3 ∤n, then according to Proposition 3.1,
|Rj|=|{0≤k′<n|gcd(k,n) = 1,k′≡a−jn(mod 12)}|
satisﬁesφ(n)/12−2ω(n)<|Rj|<φ(n)/12+2ω(n). On the other hand, if 3 |nthen 3∤(a−jn), so
by Proposition 3.2,
|Rj|=|{0≤k′<n|gcd(k,n) = 1,k′≡a−jn(mod 12)}|
satisﬁesφ(n)/8−2ω(n)−1<|Rj|<φ(n)/8+2ω(n)−1.
Settingb:= 12 when 3 ∤nandb:= 8 when 3|n, by the above consideration now
(3.6.1) m/b−m5/11<|Rj|<m/b+m5/11.
Now, ifk∈S0∪S11, then4−2√

It follows that g(m)≥g(154)>0.74, and sof(m) = exp(g(m))>2.09. Thus, for m=φ(n)≥154

Theorem 3.7. Letq= 3nwith2∤n. Ifn≥3thent(q) =t−(q) :=q−√3q+1is divisible by a
primitive prime divisor ppd(3,6n)ofq2−q+1. In all cases, t+(q) :=q+√3q+1is divisible by a
primitive prime divisor ppd(3,6n)ofq2−q+1.
Proof.(i) Note that t(3) = 1. Henceforth we will assume n≥3. Consider the sets
Aj:={1≤k≤6n|gcd(k,12n) = 1, k≡j(mod 12)},
Bj:={6n+1≤k≤12n|gcd(k,12n) = 1,k≡j(mod 12)}
forj= 1,5,7,11. Then the map k/ma√s⊔o→12n−kyields bijections
A1←→B11, A11←→B1, A5←→B7, A7←→B5,
and the map k/ma√s⊔o→k+6nyields bijections
A1←→B7, A7←→B1, A5←→B11, A11←→B5.
It follows that
(3.7.1) |A1|=|A5|=|B7|=|B11|,|A7|=|A11|=|B1|=|B5|.
Since⊔j=1,5,7,11/parenleftbig

={1≤k<12n|gcd(k,12n) = 1}, we now see that
(3.7.2) |Aj|+|Bj|=φ(12n)/4 =φ(3n)/2
for eachj= 1,5,7,11.
(ii) Make the choice of ζ:=ζ12n= exp(πi/6n) and consider the cyclotomic polynomial
Φ12n(X) =/productdisplay
1≤k<12n,gcd(k,12n)=1/parenleftbig

If 1≤k<6nthen (X−ζk)(X−ζk+6n) = (X−ζk)(X+ζk) =X2−ζk

Φ12n(X) =/productdisplay
1≤k<6n,gcd(k,6n)=1/parenleftbig
X2−ζk

= Φ6n(X2).
In particular,
(3.7.3) Φ 6n(3) = Φ 12n(√
3).
Setting
(3.7.4) Φ 12n,a(X) :=/productdisplay
1≤k<12n,gcd(k,12n)=1, k≡±a(mod 12)/parenleftbig
X−ζk/parenrightbig

fora= 1,5, we have Φ 12n(X) = Φ12n,1(X)Φ12n,5(X). Next, since
(√

for each 1≤k<12n, using the bijection k/ma√s⊔o→12n−kin (3.7.1)
(3.7.5) P3,a(n) = Φ12n,a(√
3),
fora= 1,5. Using (3.7.3) also
(3.7.6) P3,1(n)P3,5(n) = Φ6n(3).
(iii) Here we show that P3,1(n) andP3,5(n) are integers. Clearly, they are algebraic integers in
Q(ζ). Hence it suﬃces to show that each of them is ﬁxed by any Galoi s automorphism σ:ζ/ma√s⊔o→ζl,LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 17
gcd(l,12n) = 1. First consider the case j≡±1(mod 12). Then σﬁxes√
3 =ζ12+ζ−1
12, and ﬁxes
each of the sets C:=⊔j=1,11(Aj∪Bj) andD:=⊔j=1,11(Aj∪Bj) modulo 12 n. Since
P3,1(n) =/productdisplay
k∈C(√
3−ζk), P3,5(n) =/productdisplay
k∈D(√
3−ζk),
it follows that σﬁxes each of P3,1(n) andP3,5(n). Now assume that j≡±5(mod 12). Then σ

Note that modulo 12 n, whenkruns overC, 6n+klruns overC, covering each element of C
exactly once. Also, |C|=φ(3n) by (3.7.2), and so |C|is even. It follows that σsendsP3,1(n) to
(−1)|C|P3,1(n) =P3,1(n), and similarly σﬁxesP3,5(n).
(iv) We also set
f−(X) :=X2n−√
3Xn+1, f+(X) :=X2n+√
3Xn+1,
so that
t−(q) =f−(/radicalbig
(3)), t+(q) =f+(/radicalbig
(3)), f−(X)f+(X) =X4n−X2n+1.
Certainly, any root of X4n−X2n+ 1 isζkfor some integer 1 ≤k <12ncoprime to 6. If
k≡±1(mod 12), then
f−(ζk) = exp(kπi/3)+1−√
3exp(kπi/6) = 0.
Similarly, if k≡±5(mod 12), then
f+(ζk) = exp(kπi/3)+1+√
3exp(kπi/6) = 0.
It follows that
f−(X) =/productdisplay
1≤k<12n, k≡±1(mod 12)/parenleftbig

1≤k<12n, k≡±5(mod 12)/parenleftbig

Comparing to (3.7.4) and (3.7.5), we see that

1≤k<8n,gcd(k,12n)>1, k≡±1(mod 12)/parenleftbig√

is an algebraic integer. But f−(√
3) =t−(q) is an integer, and P3,1(n) is an integer by (iii). Hence
P3,1(n) dividest−(q). Similarly, P3,5(n) dividest+(q).
(v) By Proposition 3.6, P3,1(n)>n. Consider any prime divisor ℓofP3,1(n), which then divides
t−(q) by the result of (iv), and divides Φ 6n(3) by (3.7.6). Since ℓ|(q2−q+ 1),ℓ/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2,3. Suppose
thatℓis not a primitive prime divisor of 36n−1. Again by [Lun, Satz 1] ℓ|3n, whenceℓ|nasℓ≥5,
and moreover ℓ2∤Φ6n(3). It follows that the ℓ-part ofP3,1(n) isℓ. Hence, if t−(q) is not divisible
by any primitive prime divisor of 36n−1, thenP3,1(n) dividesn, a contradiction.
The proof for t+(q) is entirely similar. /square

4.Action on 2-groups and primitivity of local systems
We begin this section with a group theoretic lemma which will be used in the proof of primitivity
given in Theorem 4.5.
Lemma 4.1. SupposeAis a cyclic group of prime order pthat acts faithfully on a ﬁnite q-group
G, wherep/\⌉}a⊔io\slash=qare primes. Let nbe the order of qmodulop. Letχ∈Irr(G)beA-invariant and
faithful, and write χ(1) =qa. Thenn≤2a.LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 21
Proof.We argue by induction on |G|. LetC=CG(A)< G. LetC≤N < G be maximal A-
invariant in G. SinceGis nilpotent, N ⊳ G. Also,G/Nis an irreducible A-module. Notice that
Acannot act trivially on G/N, becauseG= [G,A]C, by coprime action. Hence, G/Nis a faithful
irreducible Fq[A]-module. By [MW, Example 2.7], say, |G/N|=qn. Letθ∈Irr(N) beA-invariant
underχ; such exists by [Is3, Theorem 13.27]. Now, since G/Nis an abelian chief factor of the
semidirect product GAandχisGA-invariant, by the Isaacs “going down” theorem [Is3, Theore m
6.18], either χN=θ, orχN=eθwithe2=|G/N|, orθG=χ.
In the third case, χ(1) =qnθ(1) =qn+b=qa, for someb≥0. Thusn≤n+b=a≤2a. In the
second case, qnis a square, and that χ(1)/θ(1) =qn/2. Thenχ(1) =qn
2+c=qa, for somec≥0.
Thena=n
2+c, and again n≤2a.
In the ﬁrst case, χN=θ∈Irr(N). IfAdoes not act trivially on N, thenAacts faithfully on N.
SinceθisA-invariant and faithful, then we are done by the inductive hy pothesis. Otherwise, Aacts
trivially on N, and therefore N=CG(A) (because Nis maximal A-invariant). By [N2, Lemma
2.1], [G,A]⊆Ker(χ). Sinceχis faithful,Aacts trivially on G. But this cannot happen. /square

Lemma 4.2. (ˇSuch)LetFbe an Airy sheaf of rank n≥2onA1/Fp, i.e.Fis the Fourier transform
FT(L)of a lisse, rank one sheaf LonA1/FpwithSwan∞(L) =n+1. IfFis induced, then it is
induced from an Artin-Schreier covering of A1/Fp. In particular, if Fis induced, then it is induced
from a normal subgroup of index pof itsGgeom.
Proof.Let us recall the argument, which is contained in the proof of [Such, Proposition 11.1]. If F
is induced, then it is g⋆H, in which case
End(F) = (g⋆H)⊗(g⋆H∨)⊇g⋆(H⊗H∨)⊇g⋆1,
and hence End0(F)⊇g⋆1/1. Butg⋆1/1has rank<n, and all its slopes are ≤(n+1)/n= 1+1/n.
But each slope of g⋆1/1has denominator in lowest terms at most the rank of g⋆1/1, which is<n.
Therefore each slope, being at most 1+1 /n, is in fact≤1. Then by [Such, Corollary 3.3], g⋆1/1
is the direct sum of various Lψ(ax).
The rest of the argument is given in the ﬁrst eight lines of the second paragraph of the proof of

is reductive. It suﬃces to show that every irreducible repre sentation of G/G∞is trivial. But a
d-dimensional irreducible representation is a lisse sheaf o f rankdonGm/Fpwhich is tame at 0
(becauseP(0) dies in G) and lisse at∞. By multiplicative inversion, this is an irreducible local
system on A1/Fpwhich is tame at ∞, so a representation of πtame
1(A1/Fp), which is the trivial
group. /square
We will also need a very special case (about subgroups of inde x 2) of (the second part of) the
following proposition. Since we cannot ﬁnd a reference for i t, we give a proof.
Proposition 4.4. (i)LetGbe a Lie group and Han abstract subgroup of ﬁnite index in G. Then
His closed.
(ii)LetGbe a reductive linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k, and letHbe an
abstract subgroup of ﬁnite index in G. ThenHis Zariski closed.
Proof.(a) We give a proof of statement (i), which is due to Jason DeVi to, posted on MathStack-
Exchange .
(a1) First we show that if Gis connected, then Gis generated by its divisible subgroups. Indeed,
there is an open set U⊆Gcontaining the identity such that U⊆exp(L) for the Lie algebra Lof
G. For anyuinU, ifu= exp(X), thenulies in the divisible subgroup {exp(tX)|t∈R}ofG.
SinceGis generated by U, the claim follows.
(a2) Next we show that if Gis connected and H≤Gis of ﬁnite index, then H=G. Indeed, by
considering the action via left translation of Gon the ﬁnite set G/Hof leftH-cosets, we see that
Hcontains a normal subgroup K✁Gof ﬁnite index. By (i), G, and soG/K, is generated by its
divisible subgroups. But G/Kis ﬁnite, so K=G.
(a3) In the general case, consider the map ι:G◦/(H∩G◦)→G/Hdeﬁned byx(H∩G◦)/ma√s⊔o→xH.
Thenιis injective, and so H∩G◦has ﬁnite index in G◦. By (a2),H≥G◦, and soHis a union of
a ﬁnite number of G◦, each of which is closed. Hence His closed.LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 23
(b) For statement (ii), the argument in (a3) shows that it suﬃ ces to prove that if Gis connected
reductive and Hhas ﬁnite index in G, thenH=G. The argument in (a2) allows us to further
assume that H✁G. Recall [C, p. 16] that G=T[G,G], whereT=Z(G)◦is a central torus of G,
and the derived subgroup [ G,G] is a central product G1◦...◦Gnof simple groups. In particular,
for eachi,H∩Giis a normal (abstract) subgroup of ﬁnite index of Gi. AsGiis generated by
(unipotent) root subgroups, [Tits, Main Theorem] implies t hatH∩Giis either equal to Gior
contained in Z(Gi). The ﬁnite index assumption now ensures that H≥Gifor alli, and thus
H≥[G,G]. Next,H∩Tis a normal (abstract) subgroup of ﬁnite index say minT. In particular,
Hcontainstmfor allt∈T. But the torus Tis (k×)rfor somer, sok=kimplies that any element
inTis anmthpower, and hence H≥T, completing the proof. [The referee kindly pointed out
a much simpler argument as follows. If H✁Ghas indexNinGthenGcontains all powers gN,
g∈G. ButG, being connected reductive, is generated by its maximal tor i, and the map g/ma√s⊔o→gN
is surjective on each maximal torus. Hence H=G.] /square
As pointed out by the referee, in both of the cases of Proposit ion 4.4, once His closed, it is also
open (indeed, G/integerdivideHis a disjoint union of a ﬁnite number of cosets gH, each being closed, and so
it is closed).
Theorem 4.5. Letq= 22n+1withn∈Z≥1andn/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2. Under the assumption (4.1.3), the group
Ggeom,F(q,f)of the Airy sheaf F(q,f)has no subgroups of index 2. As a consequence, the Airy
sheafF(q,f)is not geometrically induced, and hence none of the sheaves G(q,f,r)is geometrically
induced.
Proof.Assume to the contrary that the Airy sheaf F(q,f) is induced. Then, by Lemma 4.2, the
underlying representation Vof the geometric monodromy group G:=GgeomofF(q,f) is induced
from a subgroup G1ofGof index 2.
(i) For each divisor r>1 oft(q), consider the descent G(q,f,r). BecauseF(q,f) is lisse at 0, the
image ofI(0) in the geometric monodromy group HofG(q,f,r) is the cyclic group µr(F2) of order
r. Because the∞-slopes ofF(q,f) are(2n+1)t(q)
(2n+1)t(q)−1, ifr >1, then the∞-slopes ofG(q,f,r)
are (1/r)(2n+1)t(q)
(2n+1)t(q)−1<1.It then follows from [KT1, Proposition 4.2] that His equal to the
Zariski closure HZar
0inHof the normal closure H0inHof the image of I(0).
We next show that for r>1,Hhas no subgroup of index 2. We argue by contradiction. Suppos e
thatHhas a subgroup H1of index 2. Since every H-conjugate of the image of I(0) has odd order
r, all such conjugates are contained in H1, and thusH0≤H1. ButH1is closed in Hby Proposition
4.4(ii), soH=HZar
0≤H1, and hence H=H1, a contradiction. We have shown that Hhas no
subgroup of index 2.
(ii) We also know that Gis a normal subgroup of Hof index dividing r, simply because by the rth
power map, Gm/F2becomes a ﬁnite ´ etale Galois covering of itself with cyclic group of order r, and
GandHare respectively the Zariski closure of the images of π1(Gm/F2) and of a normal subgroup
of cyclic index rof that group. Now if H=G, then the existence of G1leads to a contradiction by
(i). If we now take rto be a prime dividing t(q), thenH/G∼=Cr.
LetJandQdenote the images of I(∞) and ofP(∞) inH. By Theorem 4.3, His equal to the
Zariski closure HZar
∞inHof the normal closure H∞inHofJ. Suppose for the moment that r∤|J|.
Then every H-conjugate of Jhas order coprime to r, and so they are all contained in G, and thus
H∞≤G. ButGis closed in H, soHZar
∞≤G, and hence H=G, a contradiction.24 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
We have shown that rdivides|J|. Recall that J=Q⋊C, withCa cyclic 2′-group that permutes
cyclically and transitively the q−1 simpleQ-submodules ViinV, each of dimension q0= 2n. As
Qis a 2-group, Cis of order divisible by r.
(iii) Sincen/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2, by Theorem 3.4 the integer t(q) =q−√2q+1 admits a prime divisor
(4.5.1) r= ppd(2,4(2n+1)).
At this point, we take for ra ppd(2,4(2n+ 1)) which divides t(q). Fixc∈Cof orderr. Since
r|t(q),r∤(q−1), and socstabilizes each of the subspace Vi, and certainly normalizes Q. For eachi,
let Φidenote the representation of /a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔Q,c/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔onVi. We claim that Φ i(c) centralizes Φ i(Q). Otherwise,
Φi(c) acts faithfully on Φ i(Q), of prime order r, and Φi(Q) is faithful and irreducible of degree 2n.
Hence by Lemma 4.1, the order of 2 modulo ris at most 2 n, which contradicts (4.5.1).
Therefore, for each i, Φi(c) =αi·IdVifor someαi∈C×. But the cyclic group Cpermutes the
Vi’s transitively and c∈C, soα1=...=αq−1=:α, i.e.cacts onVasα·IdV. As|c|=r,α/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 1 is
a primitive rthroot of unity. Thus we may assume that c∈Jhas trace dim( V)·ζr. On the other
hand, by Theorem 2.2 and (4.1.2), the trace of every element i nJbelongs to Q(i). Thusζr∈Q(i),
a contradiction since ris an odd prime.
(iii) Since the irreducible representation VofG=GgeomofF(q,f) is not induced, for any r|t(q),
the representation of GgeomofG(q,f,r) onV, which contains G, is not induced. /square
5.Condition (S+)and autoduality for Airy sheaves
In this section, we continue to consider Airy sheaves F(q,f) of the same general shape (4.1.1),
but we consider them only geometrically, i.e. as lisse sheav es onA1/F2. The key insight on which
the results of this section are based is due to ˇSuch, cf. [Such, Proposition 11.1].
Lemma 5.1. (ˇSuch)LetFbe an Airy sheaf of rank D≥2onA1/Fp. LetHbe a direct factor of
End(F)of rankr<D. ThenHis a direct sum of Lψ(ax)for various a∈Fp.
Proof.The∞-slopes ofFare all 1 + 1 /D. All slopes of End( F) are therefore≤1 + 1/D. Thus
all slopes ofHare≤1+1/D. But each slope of H, written in lowest terms, has denominator ≤r.
ThereforeHhas all slopes≤1. Now take an irreducible constituent KofH. Its Fourier transform,
i.e.t/ma√s⊔o→Hc(A1/Fp,K⊗Lψ(tx)), is perverse irreducible on A1/Fp, so is either a single delta function
δaor is the extension by direct image of a lisse sheaf on a dense o pen set. But on a dense open set
of thet-line,K⊗Lψ(tx)has all∞-slopes 1, so H2
c(A1/Fp,K⊗Lψ(tx)) = 0 and by the Euler-Poincar´ e
formulaχc(A1/Fp,K⊗Lψ(tx)) = 0, so FT(K) is punctual, hence a single δa. This means in turn
that each irreducible constituent of His anLψ(ax). BecauseFis irreducible, End( F) is completely
reducible, henceHis completely reducible, and so it is the sum of its irreducib le constituents. /square
Theorem 5.2. LetFbe an Airy sheaf of rank at least 2onA1/Fp. Then the following conditions
are equivalent.
(i)Fis geometrically induced.
(ii) End(F)contains a summand Lψ(ax)for somea/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 0inFp.
(iii)There exists a geometric isomorphism F∼=F⊗Lψ(−ax)for somea/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 0inFp.
Proof.Let us denote by nthe rank ofF. IfFis induced, then it is g⋆H, in which case
End(F) = (g⋆H)⊗(g⋆H∨)⊇g⋆(H⊗H∨)⊇g⋆1,
and hence End0(F)⊇g⋆1/1. Butg⋆1/1has rank less than n. So by Lemma 5.1, g⋆1/1is the
direct sum of various Lψ(ax). As End0(F) does not contain the trivial sheaf (by irreducibility of F),
we ﬁnd that End0(F), and hence End( F), contains someLψ(ax)for some nonzero a∈F2.LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 25
Conversely, suppose End( F) contains a summand Lψ(ax)for somea/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 0 inFp. Thus there is
a nonzero geometric homomorphism from FtoF⊗Lψ(−ax). But source and target are geometri-
cally isomorphic, so every nonzero homomorphism is an isomo rphism. Thus we have a geometric
isomorphism
F∼=F⊗Lψ(−ax).
ThatFis geometrically induced is the special case, where GisGgeomforF⊕Lψ(−ax),VisF,Lis
Lψ(−ax),Nisp, andEisQℓ, of the following general statement in characteristic zero representation
theory. /square
Theorem 5.3. Over an algebraically closed ﬁeld Eof characteristic zero, let Vbe a ﬁnite di-
mensional irreducible representation of dimension d≥2of a group G, andLa one-dimensional
representation of Gwhich, viewed as a linear character χofG, has ﬁnite order N >1. Suppose
thatV∼=V⊗Las representations of G. Denote by G0:= Ker(χ)the kernel of χ, so thatG0✁G
withG/G0cyclic of order N. ThenVis induced from a representation of a subgroup Hwith
G0≤H <G.
Proof.We ﬁrst reduce to the case when Nis prime. If V∼=V⊗L, then by induction V∼=V⊗L⊗n
for every integer n. Letrbe a prime dividing N. Replacing LbyL⊗(N/r)and Ker(χ) by the
overgroupK:= Ker(χ(N/r)), we are reduced to the case when N=ris prime.
LetUbe a simple summand of V|K, which is semisimple since K✁G. By Cliﬀord theory,
cf. [CR1, (50.5)], Vis induced so long as V|Kis not isotypic. Hence, if Vis not induced, then
V|K∼=eU:=U⊕U⊕...⊕U/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
etimesfor somee∈Z≥1. Note that IndG
K(E)∼=⊕r
i=1L⊗i, so by Frobenius
reciprocity, cf. [CR2, (10.20)],
IndG
K(V|K)∼=IndG
K/parenleftbig
(V|K)⊗E/parenrightbig∼=V⊗IndG
K(E)∼=⊕r
i=1(V⊗L⊗i)∼=rV.
Again by Frobenius reciprocity [CR2, (10.8)],
e2= dimHom K(V|K,V|K) = dimHom G/parenleftbig
V,IndG
K(V|K)/parenrightbig
= dimHom G(V,rV) =r,
a contradiction as ris a prime. /square
The following general result is stated for ease of later refe rence.
Theorem 5.4. LetFbe a lisse irreducible Qℓ-sheaf of rank d≥2on a smooth, geometrically
connectedX/Fp. Suppose that End0(F)contains a rank one summand L. ThenFis induced.
Proof.BecauseLoccurs in End0(F), it cannot be trivial (as by irreducibility of F, End(F) contains
1exactly once). Exactly as in the proof of the implication (ii ) =⇒(iii) in Theorem 5.2, we infer
thatF∼=F⊗L−1. Taking determinants of this isomorphism, we ﬁnd that L⊗dis trivial. ThusL
has ﬁnite order N >1 as a character of π1(X). Now apply Theorem 5.3. /square
Theorem 5.5. Letk0/F2be a ﬁnite extension, and f(x)∈k0[x]a polynomial of degree (1+q0)t(q).
Then the Airy sheaf F(q,f)introduced in (4.1.1)is geometrically primitive, i.e. is not geometrically
induced.
Proof.(i) In view of Theorem 5.2, it suﬃces to show that there is no ge ometric isomorphism from
F(q,f) toF(q,f)⊗Lψ(ax)for anya/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 0 inFp. We argue by contradiction. Because F(q,f) was
geometrically a Fourier transform, so is F(q,f)⊗Lψ(ax); the eﬀect of tensoring with Lψ(ax)after
FT is the same as translating additively by −abefore FT:
F(q,f)⊗Lψ(ax)= FT([x/ma√s⊔o→x−a]⋆L(q,f)).26 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
Since FT is invertible, an isomorphism of F(q,f) withF(q,f)⊗Lψ(ax)gives an isomorphism of
L(q,f) with its additive translate by −a:
Lψ2([xt(q),f(x)])∼=Lψ2([(x−a)t(q),f(x−a)]).
We will show no such isomorphism exists.
(ii) Suppose that n≥2. In this case, we argue as follows. If two lisse rank one shea ves are
isomorphic, then so are their tensor squares.
Quite generally, addition of Witt vector of length 2 over an F2-algebra is given by
[a,b]+[A,B] = [a+A,B+b+aA],[a,b]+[a,b] = [0,a2].
Thus
L⊗2
ψ2([g(x),f(x)])=Lψ2([g(x),f(x)]+[g(x),f(x)])=Lψ2([0,g(x)2])=Lψ(g(x)2)∼=Lψ(g(x)).
So we would have a geometric isomorphism
Lψ(xt(q)))∼=Lψ((x−a)t(q))),
or equivalently a geometric isomorphism
Lψ((x−a)t(q)−xt(q))∼=Qℓ.
Now we use the explicit shape of t(q) =q+1−2q0= 2q2
0−2q0+1 = (q0−1)(2q0)+1.
The key point is that t(q) = 1+dQwithd≥2 prime top= 2 (hered=q0−1) andQa strictly
positive power of p= 2 (hereQ= 2q0). Then
(x−a)1+qD= (x−a)(xQ−aQ)d
= (x−a)/parenleftbig
xdQ−daQx(d−1)Q+(terms of degree ≤(d−2)Q)/parenrightbig
=x1+dQ−daQx1+(d−1)Q+(terms of degree ≤1+(d−2)Q)
+(polynomial in xQof degreed).
Thus up to Artin-Schreier equivalence,
(x−a)1+dQ−x1+dQ=−daQx1+(d−1)Q+(terms of degree ≤1+(d−2)Q)+(a term of degree d).
ThusLψ((x−a)1+dQ−x1+dQ)hasSwan= 1+(d−1)Q>0, so is not geometrically trivial.
(iii) We now turn to the case n= 1, which requires a more delicate analysis. What makes the
n≥2 case argument work is that q0−1 = 2n−1 hasn≥2 binary digits. In the n= 1 case,
t(8) = 5, so the above argument would involve examining
(x−a)5−x5= (x−a)(x4−a4)−x5=ax4−a4x+a5,
but this is Artin-Schreier equivalent to ( a1/4−a4)x, which for a∈µ15is Artin-Schreier trivial.
Thus we must look instead at
Lψ2([(x−a)5,f(x−a)])⊗L−1
ψ2([x5,f(x)])=Lψ2([(x−a)5,f(x−a)]−[x5,f(x)]).
Here−[a,b] = [a,b−a2], implying−[x5,f(x)] = [x5,f(x)−x10], so this is
Lψ2([(x−a)5+x5,f(x−a)+f(x)−x10+x5(x−a)5]).
Butf(x) has degree 15, say f(x) =bx15+cx14+dx13+lower terms with b/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 0. So under Artin-
Schreier equivalence
f(x)≡bx15+dx13+lower terms .
Similarly, under Artin-Schreier equivalence
f(x−a)≡b(x−a)x15+d(x−a)13+lower terms .LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 27
Thus under Artin-Schreier equivalence
f(x−a)+f(x)−x10+x5(x−a)5≡b(x−a)15−bx15+lower terms .
The diﬀerence
b(x−a)15−bx15=−abx14+ba2x13+lower terms
is thus Artin-Schreier equivalent to
ba2x13+lower terms .
Now viewLψ2([(x−a)5+x5,f(x−a)+f(x)−x10+x5(x−a)5])as the tensor product (using [ a,b] = [a,0]+[0,b])
Lψ2([(x−a)5+x5,0]⊗Lψ(f(x−a)+f(x)−x10+x5(x−a)5).
The ﬁrst factor has Swan∞≤2×4, while the second factor, which is Lψ(a polynomial of degree 13) , has
Swan∞= 13, and hence their tensor product has Swan∞= 13, so is not geometrically trivial. /square
Recall that a lisse sheaf HisLie-irreducible if, in the underlying representation of its Ggeom, the
identity component G◦
geomacts irreducibly. It is Lie-self-dual if the given representation of Ggeom,
when restricted to G◦
geom, is self-dual.
Theorem 5.6. Suppose that a lisse sheaf F(q,f)as in(4.1.1)is Lie-irreducible and Lie-self-dual.
ThenF(q,f)is self-dual.
Proof.The two sheavesF(q,f) and its dualF(q,f)∨are irreducible representations of Ggeomwhose
restrictionstotheidentitycomponent G◦
geomareisomorphic. Sothetwo, asrepresentationsof Ggeom,
diﬀer by a linear character of Ggeom/G◦
geom. Thus
F(q,f)∨∼=F(q,f)⊗L
for some lisse, rank one LonA1. BothF(q,f)∨andF(q,f) have all∞-slopes 1+1 /rank(F(q,f))<
2. Therefore Swan∞(L)≤1 (otherwiseF(q,f)∨would have all∞-slopes≥2).
IfSwan∞(L) = 0, thenLis lisse on A1and tame at∞, so geometrically trivial, and F(q,f) is
geometrically self-dual. If Swan∞(L) = 1, thenLisLψ(ax)for some nonzero a∈Fp. We will show
that this case cannot arise.
Recall thatF(q,f) := FTψ(Lψ2([xt(q),f(x)])). In general, the interaction of FT with duality is a
geometric isomorphism
D(FTψ(H))∼=FTψ(DH)).
In characteristic 2, where ψtakes values±1, we have ψ=ψ. Thus
F(q,f)∨∼=FTψ(Lψ2(−[xt(q),f(x)])) = FTψ(Lψ2([xt(q),f(x)+(xt(q))2]))
while
F(q,f)⊗Lψ(ax)∼=FTψ([x/ma√s⊔o→x−a]⋆Lψ2([xt(q),f(x)])= FTψ(Lψ2([(x−a)t(q),f(x−a)])).
By Fourier inversion, this is equivalent to a geometric isom orphism
Lψ2([xt(q),f(x)+(xt(q))2])∼=Lψ2([(x−a)t(q),f(x−a)]).
We ﬁrst treat the case n≥2. Already the tensor squares of these two lisse rank one shea ves are
not geometrically isomorphic, by the identical argument us ed to treat the case n≥2 in the proof
of Theorem 5.5.
In the case n= 1, we must show that the lisse rank one sheaf
Lψ2([(x−a)s,f(x−a)])⊗(Lψ2([x5,f(x)+(x5)2]))−128 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
is not geometrically trivial. The second tensor factor is
(Lψ2([x5),f(x)+(x5)2]))−1=Lψ2(−[x5,f(x)+(x5)2])=Lψ2([x5,f(x)]).
So we must show that
Lψ2([(x−a)5,f(x−a)])⊗Lψ2([x5),f(x)])=Lψ2([(x−a)5,f(x−a)]+[x5,f(x)])
=Lψ2([(x−a)5+x5,f(x−a)+f(x)+x5(x−a)5])
=Lψ2([(x−a)5+x5,0])⊗Lψ(f(x−a)+f(x)+x5(x−a)5)
is not geometrically trivial. Exactly as in the proof of the n= 1 case of Theorem 5.5, the ﬁrst factor
hasSwan∞≤2×4 = 8, while the second factor has Swan∞= 13. /square
Theorem 5.7. No sheafF(q,f)introduced in (4.1.1)is geometrically self-dual.
Proof.Recall thatF(q,f) := FTψ/parenleftbig
Lψ2([xt(q),f(x)])/parenrightbig
. In general, the interaction of the Fourier trans-
form FT with the duality functor D(·) is a geometric isomorphism
D(FTψ(H))∼=FTψ(DH).
In characteristic 2, where ψtakes values±1, we have ψ=ψ. ThereforeF(q,f) is self-dual if and
only ifLψ2([xt(q),f(x)])is self-dual. Its dual is Lψ2(−[xt(q),f(x)]). We have the Witt vector addition law
[x,y] = [x,0] + [0,y], and, for Witt vectors over F2-algebras,−[x,y] = [x,y+x2]. So the dual of
Lψ2([xt(q),f(x)])isLψ2([xt(q),f(x)+(xt(q))2]), and the asserted isomorphism is
Lψ2([xt(q),0)])⊗Lψ(f(x))∼=Lψ2([xt(q),0)])⊗Lψ(f(x)+(xt(q))2).
This holds if and only if there is an isomorphism
Lψ(f(x))∼=Lψ(f(x)+(xt(q))2),
or equivalently if Lψ((xt(q))2)is geometrically trivial. By the Artin-Schreier reduction we have
Lψ((xt(q))2)∼=Lψ(xt(q)). The latter sheaf is not geometrically trivial, because xt(q)is a polynomial of
odd degree t(q) and so the sheaf has Swan∞(Lψ(xt(q))) =t(q)/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 0. /square
Corollary 5.8. Suppose that the sheaf F(q,f)introduced in (4.1.1)is Lie-irreducible. Then it is
not Lie-self-dual.
Proof.Combine Theorem 5.6 and Theorem 5.7. /square
Theorem 5.9. The sheafF(q,f)introduced in (4.1.1)is tensor indecomposable.
Proof.We will show that F(q,f) is tensor indecomposable as a representation of π1:=π1(A1/Fp).
Becauseπ1has cohomological dimension ≤1 (this is true for the π1of any smooth, connected
aﬃne curve over an algebraically closed ﬁeld), the argument of [KRLT1, Corollary 10.4] shows
that ifF(q,f) is tensor decomposable, then it is linearly tensor decompo sable, i.e. we have an
isomorphism of local systems on A1/Fp,
F(q,f)∼=A⊗B,
with both rank(A),rank(B)≥2. To ﬁx ideas, suppose rank( A)≤rank(B). Then
End(F(q,f)) = End(A)⊗End(B) = (1+End0(A))⊗(1+End0(B)) contains 1+End0(A).
Thus End0(F(q,f)) contains End0(A) as a direct factor. Now End0(A) has rank less than
(rank(A))2≤rank(A)rank(B) = rank(F(q,f)).
So by Lemma 5.1, End0(F(q,f)) contains some Lψ(ax)witha/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 0 (a/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 0 because End0(F(q,f))
only contains 1once, by irreducibility of F). The proof of Theorem 5.5 shows this is impossible. /squareLOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 29
Lemma 5.10. For every integer n≥2, the integer 2n−1is never a perfect power xmwithx∈Z
andm≥2.
Proof.We argue by contradiction. If 2n−1 =xm, thenxis odd andxm= 2n−1≡3(mod 4). Thus
mis odd, and hence 2n=xm+1 is divisible by x+1. The quotientxm+1
x+1>1 is the alternating sum
ofmpowers of the odd integer x, so is itself odd. Thusxm+1
x+1is an odd divisor of 2n, the desired
contradiction. /square
Corollary 5.11. Forn≥1, no lisse sheaf of rank 2n(22n+1−1)can be tensor induced. In particular,
F(q,f)is not tensor induced.
Theorem 5.12. The local systems F(q,f)onA1/F2introduced in (4.1.1)all satisfy the condition
(S+)of[KT1, Deﬁnition 1.2] .
Proof.First, by [Such, Proposition 7.4] the underlying represent ationVofGgeomofF(q,f) is
irreducible. That F(q,f) is primitive, tensor indecomposable, and not tensor induc ed is the content
of Theorem 5.5, Theorem 5.9 and Corollary 5.11. That det( F(q,f)) has ﬁnite order results from the

Theorem 5.13. For the local system F(q,f)onA1/F2introduced in (4.1.1), every irreducible
constituent of End0(F(q,f))has dimension≥rank(F(q,f)). In particular, if Ggeom,F(q,f)is not
ﬁnite, then G◦
geom,F(q,f)is a simple algebraic group of dimension ≥rank(F(q,f)).
Proof.By Lemma 5.1, any irreducible constituent of dimension < D:= rank(F(q,f)) is a single
Lψ(ax), while Theorem 5.5 shows that End0(F(q,f)) contains noLψ(ax). BecauseF(q,f) satis-
ﬁes condition ( S+) by Theorem 5.12, if Ggeom,F(q,f))is not ﬁnite, then its identity component
G◦
geom,F(q,f))is a simple algebraic group. In that case, Lie( G◦
geom,F(q,f))) is an irreducibleconstituent
of End0(F(q,f)), so has dimension ≥D. /square
Theorem 5.14. Consider the sheaf F(q,f)in(4.1.1)subject to the condition (4.1.3). Then, for
eachr|t(q), the descentG(q,f,r)satisﬁes the condition (S+)of[KT1, Deﬁnition 1.2] .
Proof.BecauseGgeom,F(q,f)is a subgroup of Ggeom,G(q,f,r)of ﬁnite index, the fact that F(q,f)
satisﬁes condition ( S+), see Theorem 5.12, implies that G(q,f,r) does as well. [Condition ( S+)
holds for (G,V) if it holds for ( H,V) withHa subgroup of Gof ﬁnite index.] /square
We also record the following
Theorem 5.15. Under the condition (4.1.3), if the sheafF(q,f)in(4.1.1)is Lie-irreducible, then
it is not Lie-self-dual.
Proof.This is just a restatement of Corollary 5.8, under the more re strictive hypotheses of (4.1.3).
Given Theorem 5.7, it suﬃces to show that if F(q,f) is Lie-irreducible and Lie-self-dual, then it is
self-dual.
However, there is a simpler proof of this last fact, using the descentG(q,f) :=G(q,f,t(q)) in
Theorem 5.14. Exactly as in the proof of Theorem 5.6, we ﬁnd an isomorphism
G(q,f)∨∼=G(q,f)⊗L
for some lisseLonGmof rank one. Because G(q,f)∨andG(q,f) are both tame at 0 and with all
∞-slopes<1,Lis tame on Gm, hence a Kummer sheaf Lχ. BecauseG(q,f)∨andG(q,f) both have
I(0) representations which are sums of characters of order di vidingt(q),χis a ratio of characters
of order dividing t(q), soχhas order dividing t(q). Pulling back this isomorphism by t(q)thpower,
we get an isomorphism F(q,f)∨∼=F(q,f). /square30 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
6.A local system for the Suzuki group2B2(8)
Now we can prove the ﬁrst main result of the paper, which estab lishes [Ka5, Conjecture 2.2] in
the caseq= 8:
Theorem 6.1. Letq= 8. Both the local systems FqandGqhave geometric monodromy group
Ggeom∼=2B2(8)in one of its irreducible representation of degree 14. OverF2, the local systems Fq
andGqhave arithmetic monodromy group Garith∼=Aut(2B2(8)).
Proof.(a) LetG, respectively H, denote the geometric monodromy group of Fq, respectively ofGq.
Similarly, let Garith, respectively Harith, denote the arithmetic monodromy group of Fq, respectively
ofGq, overF2. We will use the fact that f:= Frob 1,F2has order 15 and trivial determinant. Indeed,
aMagma calculation shows that
Trace(Frob 1,F215|Gq) = Trace(Frob 1,F215|Fq) = 14.
By Theorem 2.2, Frob 1,F215|Gqis semisimple, hence (being of weight zero in a 14-dimension al rep-
resentation) is the identity. Therefore det(Frob 1,F215|Gq)) is a root of unity of order dividing both
4 (by Theorem 2.1) and 15, so this determinant is trivial. But Harith=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔f,H/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔, andHhas triv-
ial determinant (by Theorem 2.1), and hence Harithalso has trivial determinant. As G✁Hand
Garith≤Harithare subgroups, both GandGarithhave trivial determinants.
Recall that Gis normal in Hof index dividing t(q) = 5. By Theorem 5.12, Hsatisﬁes ( S+).
Since the rank of the sheaves is 14, not a prime power, by [KT1, Lemma 1.1] this implies that
either the identity component H◦ofHis a simple algebraic group that acts irreducibly on the
underlying representation VofH, orHis a ﬁnite almost quasisimple group with L:=H(∞)also
acting irreducibly on V.
(b) Consider the former case. Note that if H◦is classical of rank r, then either it is of type A
andr≤13, orr≤7 by [KlL, Proposition 5.4.11]. Using the tables of [Lu], we s ee thatH◦is of
type SL 2, SL14, Sp4, Sp6, Sp14, SO14, orG2. Since [H:G]<∞,G◦=H◦.
Supposeﬁrstthat H◦= SL14(C). Inthiscase, Visjustthenatural modulefor H◦, henceM2,2(V)
takes the smallest possible value 2 for all H◦,H,G◦, andG. But this contradicts Corollary 1.2.
Next suppose that G◦=H◦is of type SL 2, Sp4, Sp6, Sp14, SO14, orG2. In all these cases, the
G◦-moduleVis self-dual, and this contradicts Corollary 5.8.
(c) We have shown that His ﬁnite, and we are in the almost quasisimple case. In this ca se,Harith
is also ﬁnite, and H(∞)
arith=H(∞)=G(∞)
arith=G(∞)=L. Letϕdenote the character of Harithin the
underlying representation V. Then the formula for the trace function of Gqand the existence of an
element with trace 2 ζ4show that
(6.1.1) Q(ϕ) =Q(ζ4).
Since any element zofCHarith(L) =Z(Harith) acts as a root of unity γonV, this implies that
γ4= 1. Since Harithhas trivial determinant, γ14= 1 and thus γ=±1. It follows that
(6.1.2) |CHarith(L)|=|Z(Harith)|≤2.
Now, using (6.1.1) and the fact that Lacts irreducibly on V=C14, the classiﬁcation results of
[HM] show that L= PSL 2(13), SL 2(13),A7,A8, SU3(3),G2(3), 2·J2,A15, or2B2(8).
In all but the last case, ϕ|Lis real-valued; furthermore, |Out(L)|≤2. As shown in the proof
of Theorem 4.5, Ghas no subgroups of index 2, so Gcan induce only inner automorphisms of L.
ButGarith=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔G,f/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔, implyingGarith/G֒→C15; so the same conclusion holds for Garith, and hence
Garith=CGarith(L)L=Z(Garith)L, with|Z(Garith|≤2 by (6.1.2). On the other hand, as we saw in
the computation for the proof of Corollary 1.2, some g∈Garithhas trace 2ζ4onV. Writeg=zh
withz∈Z(Garith) andh∈L. It follows that 2 ζ4=ϕ(g) =±ϕ(h), a contradiction since ϕ(h)∈R.LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 31
We have therefore shown that L=2B2(8). As|Out(L)|= 3, (6.1.2) implies that |H/L|divides
6. On the other hand, His the normal closure of the image of order 5 of I(0), so we conclude that
H=L. SinceL✁G✁H, we also get G=L.
Recalling again that Garith/G ֒→C15, we now see from (6.1.2) that Z(Garith) = 1 and thus
Garith֒→Aut(L)∼=L⋊C3. AMagma computation shows the existence of a Frobenius element
with traceζ4, and this implies that Garith>L, whenceGarith= Aut(L). SinceHarithis generated
overHbyf= Frob 1,F2, an element of order 15, Z(Harith) = 1 by (6.1.2). Thus Harith֒→Aut(L),
and soHarith= Aut(L) asHarith≥Garith. /square
7.Low-dimensional representations of classical groups
In this section, we will extend the classiﬁcation results ob tained in [KlL, Proposition 5.4.11] and
[Lu, Theorem 5.1]. Even though the intended applications in the paper only need the complex case
of these results, we establish them in the modular case, whic h is interesting in its own right.
LetFbe an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic p≥0 and letGbe a simple, simply
connected, classical algebraic group of rank roverF. Fixing a maximal torus in G, we consider the
set of simple roots {α1,...,αr}and the corresponding set of fundamental weights {̟1,...,̟r}(in
the ordering of [OV]). Then the set
Λ+=/braceleftiggr/summationdisplay
i=1ai̟i|ai∈Z,ai≥0/bracerightigg
of dominant weights admits the partial ordering ≻whereλ≻µprecisely when λ−µ=/summationtextr
i=1kiαi
for some non-negative integers ki. As usual, Wdenotes the Weyl group. If λ∈Λ+, letL(λ) denote
the irreducible FG-module with highest weight λ.
We will rely on the following two results.
Theorem 7.1. [Pr]LetGbe a simple, simply connected algebraic group in characteri sticp>0. If
the root system of Ghas diﬀerent root lengths, then we assume that p/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2, and ifGis of typeG2,
then we also assume that p/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 3. Letλbe a restricted dominant weight. Then the set of weights Π(λ)
of the irreducible G-moduleL(λ)is the union of the W-orbits of dominant weights µwithλ≻µ.✷
Lemma 7.2. [H, Lemma 10.3B] Letλ=/summationtextr
i=1ai̟ibe a dominant weight. Then the stabilizer of
λin the Weyl group is the Young subgroup generated by the reﬂec tionsρialong the simple roots αi
for whichai= 0. ✷
Our ﬁrst result treats groups of type Aand includes a strengthening for SL 22:
Theorem 7.3. LetG= SLn(F)withn=r+1≥8, and letL(λ)be an irreducible FG-representation,
which is restricted if p= Char(F)>0. Suppose that dimL(λ)≤M, whereM:=/parenleftbign
4/parenrightbig
ifn/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 22and
M:= 8176ifn= 22. Thenλ= 0,a̟1ora̟rwith1≤a≤3,̟1+̟r,̟2or̟r−1,̟3or̟r−2,
̟4or̟r−3,̟1+̟2or̟r−1+̟r,2̟1+̟ror̟1+2̟r, and̟2+̟ror̟1+̟r−1.
Proof.Write the highest weight λas/summationtextr
i=1ai̟iwithai∈Z≥0.
(a) First suppose that there is some weight µ=/summationtextr
i=1bi̟i∈Λ+withλ≻µandbj/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 0 for some
s+1≤j≤r−s, where
s:= 3 ifn/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 22 ands:= 4 ifn= 22.
By Theorem 7.1, Π( λ) contains the W-orbitO(µ) ofµ. By Lemma 7.2,
StabW(µ)≤/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔ρ1,...,ρj−1,ρj+1,...,ρr/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔=Sj×Sn−j32 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
(whereρi= (i,i+1)∈W=Sn). Hence
dimL(λ)≥|O(µ)|≥[Sn: (Sj×Sn−j)] =/parenleftbiggn
j/parenrightbigg
≥/parenleftbiggn
s+1/parenrightbigg
≥M,
a contradiction if n= 22, or if 5≤j≤r−4. Suppose j∈{4,r−3}andn/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 22. Then dim L(λ) =
|O(µ)|=/parenleftbign
4/parenrightbig
, showingµis the unique dominant weight of L(λ), whenceµ=λ. This also forces
StabW(λ) =Sj×Sn−j, and soλ=aj̟j. Now ifa≥2, thenλ≻λ−αj=̟j−1+(aj−2)̟j+̟j+1,
and the latter is another dominant weight of L(λ), a contradiction. So λ=̟4or̟r−3in such a
case.
We may therefore assume that
(7.3.1) aj= 0 for every s+1≤j≤r−s.
Next suppose that/summationtexts
i=1iai≥s+ 1. By [GLT, Lemma 2.6] (applied with m=s), there is some
weightµ=/summationtextr
i=1bi̟i∈Λ+withλ≻µandbs+1> as+1. This situation is already considered by
the preceding analysis. Using the symmetry under the graph a utomorphism τofG,

i=1iai≤s,s/summationdisplay
i=1iar+1−i≤s.
(b) Suppose a4>0 orar−3>0. By symmetry, we may assume a4>0. By (7.3.2) n= 22,
a4= 1, anda1=a2=a3= 0. Now if λ/\⌉}a⊔io\slash=̟4, thenaj≥1 for some r−3≤j≤rby (7.3.1). By
Lemma 7.2,
StabW(λ)≤/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔ρ1,ρ2,ρ3,ρ5,ρ6,...,ρj−1,ρj+1,...,ρr/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔∼=S4×Y1,
withY1a proper Young subgroup of Sn−4and hence|Y1|≤(n−5)!. It follows that
dimL(λ)≥[W: StabW(λ)]≥(n−4)/parenleftbiggn

a contradiction. Hence from now on we may assume that a4=ar−3= 0.
(c) Suppose that a3>0 orar−2>0. By symmetry, we may assume a3>0, and soa3= 1 by
(7.3.2). Suppose aj≥1 for somer−3≤j≤r. By Lemma 7.2,
(7.3.3) Stab W(λ)≤/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔ρ1,ρ2,ρ4,ρ5,...,ρj−1,ρj+1,...,ρr/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔∼=S3×Y2,
withY2a proper Young subgroup of Sn−3and hence|Y2|≤(n−4)!. It follows that
dimL(λ)≥[W: StabW(λ)]≥(n−3)/parenleftbiggn
3/parenrightbigg
>M
(asn≥8), a contradiction. Now, if n/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 22, then using (7.3.1) and (7.3.2) we see that λ=̟3. If
n= 22 butλ/\⌉}a⊔io\slash=̟3, thenλ=̟1+̟3. In this case, λ−(α1+α2+α3) =̟4is also a weight of
L(λ) by Theorem 7.1, and since
StabW(̟1+̟3) =/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔ρ2,ρ4,ρ5,...,ρr/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔∼=S2×Sn−3,StabW(̟4) =S4×Sn−4

which contradicts dim L(λ)<M.
(d) We may now assume that ai= 0 for 3≤i≤r−2. Suppose that a2>0 orar−1>0.
By symmetry, we may assume a2>0. Ifa2≥2, then by (7.3.2) n= 22, (a2,a1) = (2,0). Note
thatλ≻λ−α2=̟1+̟3+ar−1̟r−1+ar̟r. It follows from Theorem 7.1 that Π( λ) containsLOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 33
̟1+̟3+ar−1̟r−1+ar̟rand̟4+ar−1̟r−1+ar̟r. The lengths of W-orbits of these two
weights are at least 11395 by (7.3.4), and so dim L(λ)>M.
Ifa2= 1 buta1≥2, then by (7.3.2) n= 22, (a2,a1) = (1,2). Note that
λ≻λ−α1= 2̟2+ar−1̟r−1+ar̟r.
The preceding arguments show that Π( λ) contains the weights ̟1+̟3+ar−1̟r−1+ar̟rand
̟4+ar−1̟r−1+ar̟r, and again dim L(λ)>M.
Hencea2= 1 anda1≤1. Ifar=ar−1= 0, then λ=̟2or̟1+̟2. So assume that
ar+ar−1>0.
Suppose that ar−1>0. Then by Lemma 7.2
(7.3.5) Stab W(λ)≤/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔ρ1,ρ3,ρ4,...,ρr−2,ρr/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔=S2×Sn−4×S2.
It follows that
dimL(λ)≥[W: StabW(λ)]≥n!
(n−4)!·(2!)2>M,
a contradiction. Hence ar−1= 0.
Suppose next that ar≥2. Then
λ≻ν1:=λ−αr=λ−(2̟r−̟r−1) =a1̟1+̟2+(ar−1+1)̟r−1+(ar−2)̟r.
Thusν1∈Π(λ)∩Λ+, and (7.3.5) applied to ν1shows that
dimL(λ)≥|O(ν1)|≥[Sn: (S2×Sn−4×S2)]>M.
We may therefore assume that ar= 1. Ifa1= 0 thenλ=̟2+̟r. Otherwise λ=̟1+̟2+̟r,
in which case λ≻ν2:=λ−(α1+α2) =λ−(̟1+̟2−̟3) =̟3+̟r. But in such a case, (7.3.3)
applied toν2shows that
dimL(λ)≥|O(ν2)|≥(n−3)/parenleftbiggn
3/parenrightbigg
>M.
(e) We may now assume that ai= 0 for 2≤i≤r−1, i.e.λ=a̟1+b̟rwiths≥a≥b≥0 (by
symmetry). Suppose a≥4, whencen= 22 anda= 4 by (7.3.2). Then λ≻λ−2α1= 2̟2+b̟r,
and so dim L(λ)>Mby the ﬁrst paragraph of (d).
Supposea= 3 butb >0. Thenλ≻ν3:=λ−(2α1+α2) =λ−(3̟1−̟3) =̟3+b̟r, and
(7.3.3) applied to ν3shows that dim L(λ)≥|O(ν3)|>M. Henceλ=̟3.
Supposea=b= 2, i.e.λ= 2̟1+2̟r. Thenλ≻ν4:=λ−(α1+αr) =̟2+̟r−1. In such a
case,
dimL(λ)≥|O(ν4)|≥n!
(n−4)!·(2!)2>M,
by using (7.3.5) for ν4. Soa+b≤3, and thus λ= 2̟1+̟r, 2̟1,̟1+̟r,̟1, or 0. /square
To handle the other classical groups, we ﬁrst consider a spec ial case. Again, we use the weight
labeling as in [OV].
Proposition 7.4. LetGbe a simply connected simple algebraic group over Fof typeBr,Cr, or
Dr, withr≥7. Then
dimL(̟1+̟2)≥/braceleftbigg
4r(r2−1)/3, ifp= 3,
4r(r−1)(2r−1)/3,ifp/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 3.
Proof.Note that|O(̟3)|= 8/parenleftbigr
3/parenrightbig
and|O(̟1+̟2)|= 4r(r−1). Sinceλ:=̟1+̟2is the highest
weight ofL(λ), it suﬃces to show that µ:=̟3is a weight of L(λ), with multiplicity mL(λ)(µ)≥1
ifp= 3 andmL(λ)(µ)≥2 ifp/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 3. Ifp= 3, thenλ≻λ−(α1+α2) =µ, whenceµ∈Π(λ) by
Theorem 7.1, and we are done.34 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
In what follows we may assume p/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 3. We realize the roots and the weights of Gusing an
orthonormal basis ( ei|1≤i≤r) ofRr(with scalar product ( ·,·)); in particular, ̟1=e1,
̟2=e1+e2,̟3=e1+e2+e3. Consider the simple (Weyl) module V(λ) of the corresponding
algebraic group over C. Thenν∈Λ+is a weight of V(λ) precisely when λ≻ν. Writing̟iin
terms of simple roots (see [OV, Table 2]), it is straightforw ard to check that this is equivalent to
(7.4.1) ν∈/braceleftbigg
{λ,µ,̟ 1}, ifG=CrorDr,
{λ,µ,̟ 2,2̟1,0},ifG=Br.
Next we use Freudenthal’s formula [H, p. 122] to ﬁnd the multi plicitymV(λ)(µ) ofµas a weight of
V(λ). Then we must ﬁnd all multiples lαof positive roots α, withl∈Z≥1, such that µ+lαis a
weight ofV(λ), i.e.W-conjugate to one of the weights listed in (7.4.1). Again usi ng [OV, Table 2],
we can check that this happens precisely when l= 1 andα=e1−e2,e1−e3,e2−e3. In all these
cases,µ+lαisW-equivalent to λ, and we readily obtain mV(λ)(µ) = 2.
Suppose now that
(7.4.2) mL(λ)(µ)≤1.
This can happen only when µis a weight of some composition factor L(ν0) of a reduction modulo
pofV(λ), whereν0is listed in (7.4.1). Note that if νis such a weight and ν/\⌉}a⊔io\slash=µ, thenν/\⌉}a⊔io\slash≻µ.
It follows that ν0=µ, i.e.L(µ) is a composition factor of a reduction modulo pofV(λ). By the
linkage principle, see [Jan], this implies that w◦λ=µfor somew∈Wp. Here, the aﬃne Weyl
groupWpis generated by the map ρα,l◦λ=ρα◦λ+lpα, whereαis a simple root, l∈Zandρα
denotes the reﬂection corresponding to α; furthermore, ρα◦λ=ρα(λ+δ)−δ, whereδ:=/summationtextr
i=1̟i.
Write|v|2instead of ( v,v) forv∈Rr. Then, for any root αand anyl∈Z
|ρα,l◦λ+δ|2=|λ+δ|2+l2p2|α|2+2lp(ρα(λ+δ),α).
Observe that|α|2∈Zand

ρα(λ+δ),α/parenrightbig

=−(λ+ρ,α)∈Z.
It follows that|ρα,l◦λ+δ|2≡|λ+δ|2(mod gcd(2 ,p)). Thus we have shown
(7.4.3) If two weights λ, µare linked, then|λ+δ|2≡|µ+δ|2(mod gcd(2 ,p)p).
(Note that a slightly weaker result than (7.4.3), namely onl y modulop, was obtained in [T, Lemma
2.1].) In our case, |λ+δ|2−|µ+δ|2= 6. Applying (7.4.3), we conclude that (7.4.2) can happen
only whenp= 3. /square
Theorem 7.5. LetGbe a simply connected simple algebraic group over Fof typeBr,Cr, orDr,
withr≥12. LetL(λ)be an irreducible FG-representation, which is restricted if p:= Char( F)>0.
Suppose that dimL(λ)≤M, whereM:= 2(r+ 1)3ifr≥14, andM:=r3ifr= 12,13. Then
λ=a̟1with0≤a≤3,̟2,̟3, or̟1+̟2. Moreover, if λ=̟1+̟2andr≥16, thenp= 3.

theW-orbitO(λ) ofλis at least [W: StabW(λ)]≥2r−1>M.
Next suppose that ai>0 for some 4≤i≤r−3. In this case, if Gis of typeXrso that
W=W(Xr), then Stab W(λ) is contained in W(Ai−1)×W(Xr−i) by Lemma 7.2, hence

Applying this argument to µ=/summationtextr
i=1bi̟i∈Π(λ)∩Λ+, we deduce that
(7.5.1) bi= 0 for 4≤i≤r.
(b) Suppose a3>0. Ifa1>0 ora2>0, then Stab W(λ)≤W(A1)×W(Xr−3), whence
(7.5.2) |O(λ)|≥4r(r−1)(r−2)>2(r+1)3
(sincer≥9), contradicting the bound on dim L(λ). Soλ=a3̟3. Now, ifa3≥2 (and sop/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2 as
λis restricted), then by Theorem 7.1
λ≻λ−α3=̟2+̟4∈Π(λ)∩Λ+,
violating (7.5.1). Hence λ=̟3in this case.
We have shown that a3= 0. Suppose a2>0. Now, ifa2≥2 (so again p/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2), then
λ≻λ−α2= (a1+1)̟1+(a2−2)̟2+̟3∈Π(λ),
leading to a contradiction by applying (7.5.2) to λ−α2. Ifa2= 1 buta1≥2, thenp/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2 and
λ≻λ−(α1+α2) = (a1−1)̟1+̟3∈Π(λ),
again yielding a contradiction by applying (7.5.2) to λ−α1−α2. Henceλ∈{̟2,̟1+̟2}in this
case.
We are left with the case λ=a̟1. Ifa≥4, then again p/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2 and
λ≻λ−(2α1+α2) = (a1−3)̟1+̟3∈Π(λ),
leading to a contradiction by applying (7.5.2) to λ−2α1−α2. So 0≤a≤3 as stated.
(c) We make some more comments about the cases λ∈{3̟1,̟3,̟1+̟2}. Note that
3̟1−α1=̟1+̟2,(̟1+̟2)−(α1+α2) =̟3.
So, assuming p/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2 whenλ=̟1+̟2, we may assume ̟3∈Π(λ) in all these three cases. It now
follows from Lemma 7.2 that in these cases
dimL(λ)≥|O(̟3)|= 4r(r−1)(r−2)/3>r3.

8.A dichotomy for monodromy groups
We will need some preliminary facts:
Lemma 8.1. Letn∈Z≥1and letD:= 2n(22n+1−1). Then none of the following equations
(i)D=x2−1,
(ii)D=x(x−1)/2,
(iii)D=x(x−1)/2−1andn≥2,
has a solution in the positive integers.36 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
Proof.(i) Suppose x2−1 =Dfor somex∈Z≥1. Checking the cases 1 ≤n≤7 directly, we may
assumen≥8. Nowx>1 is odd, and gcd( x−1,x+1) = 2, but 2n|(x2−1). It follows that there
is someǫ=±1 such that 2n−1|(x−ǫ). Writex−ǫ= 2n−1yfor somey∈Z≥1. Then
23n+1−2n=D=x2−1 = (2n−1y+ǫ)2−1 = 22n−2y2+2nǫy,
and soǫy+ 1 = 2n−2(2n+3−y2). This implies y >1, andy+ǫis divisible by 2n−2. Hence
y+ǫ= 2n−2zfor somez∈Z≥1. In this case, y≥2n−2−1,x≥22n−3−2n−1−1, and so
x2−1>24n−7≥23n+1>D(asn≥8), a contradiction.
(ii) Suppose x(x−1)/2 =Dfor somex∈Z≥1. Then gcd( x−1,x) = 1, but 2n+1|x(x−1). It
follows that there is some ǫ∈{0,1}such that 2n+1|(x−ǫ). Writex−ǫ= 2n+1yfor somey∈Z≥1.
Ifǫ= 0, then
23n+2−2n+1= 2D=x(x−1) = 22n+2y2−2n+1y,
and soy−1 = 2n+1(y2−2n). This implies y>1, andy−1 is divisible by 2n+1. Hencey−1≥2n+1,
x>22n+2, and sox(x−1)>24n+4>23n+1>D, a contradiction. If ǫ= 1, then
23n+2−2n+1= 2D=x(x−1) = 22n+2y2+2n+1y,
and soy+1 = 2n+1(2n−y2). This implies 1 ≤y <2n/2, andy+1 is divisible by 2n+1, which is
impossible.
(iii) Suppose n≥2 andD=x(x−1)/2−1 = (x+ 1)(x−2)/2 for some x∈Z≥1. Then
gcd(x+ 1,x−2)|3, but 2n+1|(x+ 1)(x−2). It follows that there is some ǫ∈{−1,2}such that
2n+1|(x−ǫ). Writex−ǫ= 2n+1yfor somey∈Z≥1. Ifǫ=−1, then
23n+2−2n+1= 2D= (x+1)(x−2) = 22n+2y2−3·2n+1y,
and so 3y−1 = 2n+1(y2−2n). This implies that 3 y−1≥2 is divisible by 2n+1. Hencey≥
(2n+1+1)/3>2n−1,x+1>22n, and so (x+1)(x−2)>22n(22n−3)>23n+1>D(asn≥2), a
contradiction. If ǫ= 2, then
23n+2−2n+1= 2D= (x+1)(x−2) = 22n+2y2+3·2n+1y,
and so 3y+1 = 2n+1(2n−y2). This implies 1 ≤y <2n/2≤2n−1, and 3y+1 is divisible by 2n+1,
which is impossible when n≥2. /square

Theorem 8.2. Suppose the sheaf F(q,f)in(4.1.1), of rankD= 2n(22n+1−1), has inﬁnite
geometric monodromy group G=Ggeom. ThenG◦= SLD. Under the more restrictive condition
(4.1.3)G= SLD; moreover, the sheaf G(q,f,t(q))has geometric monodromy group equal to G.
Proof.By Theorem 5.12, Gsatisﬁes ( S+). ThusG◦≤SLD, andZ(G) is ﬁnite, but G◦is inﬁnite.
It follows from [KT1, Lemma 1.4] that G◦is irreducible on the underlying representation V, i.e.
F(q,f) is Lie-irreducible. By Theorem 5.13, G◦is a simple algebraic group of dimension ≥D.
(a) Suppose n≥3, so thatD≥1016. Then G◦must be a classical group of rank say r, where
r(2r+1)≥dimG◦≥D≥1016, whence r≥23. Also, if G◦is of typeAr, then
(8.2.1) D≤dimG◦=r(r+2)</parenleftbiggr+1

,
and ifG◦is of typeBr,Cr, orDr, then
(8.2.2) D≤r(2r+1)<r3.
In the case of Ar, we can apply Theorem 7.3 and, using the dimension formula fo rL(λ) given in
[OV, Table 5] and the bound (8.2.1), we see that the highest we ightλof theG◦-moduleVis, upLOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 37

, or (r+1)2−1; all are impossible by Lemma
8.1.
In the case of types Br,Cr, andDr, we can apply Theorem 7.5 (more precisely, (7.5.3)), and,
using the dimension formula for L(λ) given in [OV, Table 5] and the bound (8.2.2), we see that the
highest weight λof theG◦-moduleVisa̟1witha= 1,2, or̟2. Ifλ=̟1, thenG◦= Sp(V) or
SO(V), whenceF(q,f) is Lie-self-dual, contrary to Corollary 5.8. In the other c ases,D=/parenleftbigm

or/parenleftbigm

−1 for some integer m≥2, and this is impossible by Lemma 8.1.
(b) Suppose n= 2, so that D= 124. Then G◦is of typeArwithr≥11,Br,Cr, orDrwith
r≥8,E7, orE8. NeitherE7norE8has irreducible representations of degree 124, see [Lu], so G◦is
classical of rank r. IfG◦is of typeBr,Cr, orDrwith 8≤r≤11, then using [Lu] we check that G◦
has no irreducible representation of degree 124. So r≥12, and we apply Theorem 7.3, respectively
(7.5.3), as above to conclude that G= SLD.
Finally, assume that n= 1, so that D= 14. The arguments in part (b) of the proof of Theorem
6.1 repeated verbatim show that either G◦= SLD, orV|G◦is self-dual. In the former case G= SLD
as in (a), and the latter case is ruled out by Corollary 5.8.
(c) Now assume (4.1.3). Then we can consider the descent G(q,f,t(q)), for which the trace
function takes values in Q(ζ4) and all slopes are less than 1. Since p= 2, Theorem 2.1(iii) implies
thatG(q,f,t(q)) has trivial determinant, and thus G(q,f,t(q)) has geometric monodromy group
H≤SLD. ButH≥G, so we conclude H=G= SLD. /square
Theorem 8.3. Suppose the sheaf F(q,f)in(4.1.3), of rankD= 2n(22n+1−1), has ﬁnite geometric
monodromy group G=Ggeom. ThenG=2B2(q)withq= 22n+1.
Proof.(a) LetVdenote the underlying representation. By Theorem 5.12, Gsatisﬁes ( S+) onV.
But the dimension D= dim(V) =q0(q−1), withq0:= 2n, is not a prime power. Hence Gis almost
quasisimple by [KT1, Lemma 1.1]: S✁G/Z(G)≤Aut(S) for some ﬁnite, non-abelian simple group
S. Then the quasisimple subgroup L:=G(∞)acts irreducibly on Vby [KT1, Lemma 1.4].
The condition (4.1.3) allows us to consider the descent G(q,f,t(q)) onGm, with geometric mon-
odromy group H. ThenG✁Hof ﬁnite index, whence His ﬁnite and satisﬁes ( S+), andL=H(∞),
asH/G֒→Ct(q). The representation of HonVhas∞-slopesσ:= (q0+1)/D<1, and is not tame
at∞. Hence Theorem 2.5 applies to GandH. We collect some further facts about ( G,V) and the
characterϕofHonVthat we will use in the proof:
(i)Q(ϕ|G) =Q(ϕ) =Q(i). Indeed, by Theorem 2.1(i), the arithmetic monodromy grou pHarith,k0
ofG(q,f,t(q)) overk0has ﬁnite determinant. But it normalizes the ﬁnite irreduci ble subgroup
H, so ﬁnite determinant implies that Harith,k0is ﬁnite. Now, by Chebotarev density, the
ﬁniteness of Harith,k0implies that all elements of it are Frobenii, and all Frobeni i have traces
inQ(i). ButG≤H≤Harith,k0, soQ(ϕ|G)⊆Q(ϕ)⊆Q(i). ButV|Gis not self-dual by
Theorem 5.7, hence Q(ϕ|G) =Q(i) =Q(ϕ). Since each element of Z(H) acts as a root of
unity onV, and the only roots of unity in Q(i) are inµ4, both|Z(G)|and|Z(H)|divide 4.
(ii) Ifn/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2, thenGis perfect and hence G=L. Indeed, by [Abh, Proposition 6], π1(A1/Fp)
has no nontrivial ﬁnite p′-quotient. SinceF(q,f) lives on A1/F2,Ghas no nontrivial quotient
of odd order. On the other hand, the proof of Theorem 4.5 shows thatGhas no quotient of
order 2 when n/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2.
(iii) The image J=QCofI(∞) hasQ=O2(J) andC=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔g∞/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔, where the central order ¯o(g∞)
is divisible by q−1. Indeed, since the ∞-slope ofF(q,f) is 1+ 1/D, this implies, by [Ka1,
Proposition 1.14], that I(∞) acts irreducibly on V, of dimension D=q0(q−1). Since the38 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
imageJofI(∞) is cyclic of p′-order modulo the image QofP(∞), it follows that g∞permutes
the pairwise non-isomorphic q−1 simpleQ-summands on V, each of dimension q0, transitively.
(b) Consider the case n≥3, so thatD≥1016, andG=Lby (ii).
(b1) First suppose that S=Amfor somem≥3. AsG/Z(G) =Am֒→GLm−1(C), by Theorem
2.5,m−1≥1/σ. Note that⌈1/σ⌉=q−2q0+ 1, som≥q−2q0+ 2≥114. It follows that
D=q0(q−1)<(m2−5m+2)/2. In this case, by [GT, Lemma 6.1] m=D+1,G=AD+1, and
V=CDis the heart of the natural permutation module. But then Vis self-dual, contrary to (i).
(b2) Next suppose that Sis a sporadic simple group. By (iii), the maximum order meo(S) of
elements in Sis at leastq−1≥127. On the other hand, meo(S)≤119, as one can check using the
[Atlas] (see also [KT1, Table 2]), a contradiction.
(b3) Consider the case Sis a simple group of Lie type in characteristic r/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 2. By Theorem
2.5, the degree eof every nontrivial projective representation over FrofSsatisﬁese2−1≥1/σ,
in particular, e≥11. Similarly, the degree dof every faithful linear representation over FrofS
satisﬁesd≥1/σ, in particular, d≥114. This rules out all classical groups of types Amor2Am
withm≤9,Bmwithm≤56, andCmorDmwithm≤7 (as PSp2m(ra) and PΩ±
2m(ra) have
faithful representations of degree m(2m−1) overFr). This also rules out exceptional groups of
typesG2,2G2, and3D4. For the remaining exceptional groups of type F4(s),E6(s),2E6(s),E7(s),
andE8(s), withs=ra, by [KS, Table A7] we have the following upper bounds s(s+ 1)(s2+ 1),
s(s6−1)/((s−1)gcd(3,s−1)), (s+1)(s2+1)(s3−1)/gcd(3,s+1), (s+1)(s2+1)(s4+1)/2, and
(s+1)(s2+s+ 1)(s5−1) formeo(S), respectively. On the other hand, q0(q−1) =Dis at least
the smallest degree d(S) of nontrivial projective complex representations of S, which in turn is at
leasts6(s2−1),s9(s2−1),s9(s2−1),s15(s2−1),s27(s2−1), respectively, see e.g. [TZ, Table I],
and we arrive at a contradiction in all ﬁve cases, as q−1≤meo(S) by (iii) and D</radicalbig
q3/2.
IfS= PSLm(s) or PSU m(s) withm≥11, thenm2−1≥1/σ, and som2≥q−2q0+ 2, by
Theorem 2.5. Since m≥11, by [TZ, Theorem 1.1]
D≥sm−s
s+1≥3m−3
4>m3≥(q−2q0+2)3/2>q0(q−1),
a contradiction. For Sof typeBCDmwithm≥7, we have min( m(2m−1),2m+1)≥1/σ, and so
2m2≥q−2q0+1, by Theorem 2.5. Since m≥7, by [TZ, Theorem 1.1]
D≥sm−1
2≥3m−1
2>3m3≥(3/23/2)(q−2q0+1)3/2>q0(q−1),
again a contradiction.
(b4) We may now assume that Sis a simple group of Lie type in characteristic 2, deﬁned
over a ﬁeld Fswiths= 2a. Sincen≥3, by Theorem 3.4, t(q) =q−2q0+ 1 admits a divisor
ℓ= ppd(2,4(2n+ 1)). Next, we use the fact that the image of I(0) inHhas orderq−2q0+ 1,
which implies that Hhas an element of prime order ℓthat normalizes G=L. ButCH(G) =Z(H)
has order dividing 4 by (i), so
(8.3.1) ℓdivides|Aut(L)|.
First suppose that S= Sp2m(s) withm≥2 or PΩ±
2m(s) withm≥3. Then, (8.3.1) implies that
ℓ≥4(2n+1)+1≥29 dividesa|S|. If moreover ℓ∤a, thenℓdivides/producttextm
i=1(s2i−1), which implies
2ma≥4(2n+1) by primitivity of ℓ. In either case,
(8.3.2) sm= 2ma≥22(2n+1)=q2≥214LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 39
Now, applying [TZ, Theorem 1.1] for m≥3 we obtain
q3/2>D≥d(S)≥(sm−1)(sm−1−1)
s2−1>s2m−3/2≥sm/2≥q2/2,
a contradiction. If S= PSp4(s), thens≥q≥27by (8.3.2), and so
q3/2>D≥d(S) =s(s−1)2/2≥q(q−1)2/2>q2,
again a contradiction.
Next suppose that S= PSLm(s) or PSU m(s) withm≥2. The same arguments as above show
that (8.3.2) still holds; in fact, sm≥q4forS= PSLm(s). Assume that S= PSLm(s) withm≥2;
in particular, sm−1≥sm/2≥q2. Then using [TZ, Theorem 1.1] we obtain that
q3/2>D≥d(S)≥sm−s
s−1>sm−1≥q2,
a contradiction. Next, assume that S= PSUm(s) withm≥5; in particular, q3/2≤s3m/4≤sm−5/4.
Then using [TZ, Theorem 1.1] we obtain that
q3/2

3(sm−5/4−1)>25/4

again a contradiction. When S= PSU 4(s),ℓ|aorℓdivides (s+1)(s2−1)(s3+1)(s4−1), so instead
of (8.3.2) now s3≥q2. Again using [TZ, Theorem 1.1] we obtain
q3/2>D≥d(S)≥s4−1
s+1>s3/2≥q2/2,
a contradiction. Finally, if S= PSU 3(s), thens3≥q2≥214from (8.3.2). But every irreducible
character of SU 3(s) of even degree has degree divisible by s≥q2/3, and hence cannot be equal to
D=q0(q−1).
LetSbe one of the exceptional groups of type G2(s) withs>2,3D4(s),2F4(s)′withs>2,F4(s)
withs>2,E6(s),2E6(s),E7(s), andE8(s). Thatℓdivides|Aut(S)|impliesq4≤sc, where
c= 6,12,12,12,12,18,18,30,
respectively. It follows that D<q3/2≤s3c/8, with
3c/8 = 9/4,9/2,9/2,9/2,9/2,27/4,27/4,45/4,
respectively. But this contradicts the lower bounds D≥d(S)≥s(s2−1),s3(s2−1),s4(s−1)/radicalbig
s/2,
s6(s2−1),s9(s2−1),s9(s2−1),s15(s2−1),s27(s2−1), respectively, see e.g. [TZ, Table I], and
we arrive at a contradiction in all eight cases. The cases2F4(2)′andF4(2) are ruled out because
|Aut(S)|is not divisible by the prime ℓ≥29.
The only remaining case is that S=2B2(s). Thatℓdivides|Aut(S)|impliesq4≤s4, i.e.q≤s.
ButD=q0(q−1) is the degree of some irreducible character of G, soq=s, i.e.S=2B2(q). In
this case also G=L=2B2(q), as stated.
(c) Now we consider the case n= 2, i.e.D= 124.
(c1) As the quasisimple subgroup L=G(∞)acts irreducibly on V=CD, by [HM] we have the
following possibilities for S:
PSL2(125),SL3(5),SL5(2), G2(5),A125,or2B2(32).
Here, a generator g0of the image of I(0) inHhas ordert(q) = 25 and normalizes GandL. Since
CH(L) =Z(H)≤C4by (i), 25 divides |Aut(S)|. This rules out the ﬁrst three cases.40 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
In the two cases S=G2(5) and A125,L=SandV|Lis self-dual. Since CH(L)≤C4and
|Out(S)|≤2, it follows that H/Lis a 2-group. On the other hand, Hhas no quotient of order 2,
as shown in part (i) of the proof of Theorem 4.5 (which also wor ks forn= 2). Hence H=L=G,
and soF(q,f) is self-dual. But this contradicts Theorem 5.7.
The only remaining case is S=2B2(32), in which case L=S.
(c2) The rest of this paragraph applies to all n≥1, for which we know L=S=2B2(q).
Since Out(S)∼=C2n+1, butG=O2′(G), we see that G=Z(G)S, withZ(G)≤C4. Recall that
H/G ֒→Ct(q)andZ(H)≤C4. In particular, Z(H)G/G∼=Z(H)/Z(G) has order dividing both 4
andt(q), whence Z(H) =Z(G). Next,H/Gacts trivially on G/S∼=Z(G), i.e.G/S≤Z(H/S), and
the quotient ( H/S)/(G/S)∼=H/Gis cyclic. It follows that H/Sis an abelian group. As mentioned
above,Hhas no quotient of order 2, so 2 ∤|H/S|, whence Z(G) = 1; in particular G=Swhen
n= 2. We have also shown that CH(S) =Z(H) = 1, so
(8.3.3) S✁H≤Aut(S) =S⋊C2n+1
(d) Finally, we consider the case n= 1, i.e.D= 14. As the quasisimple group G=Lacts
irreducibly on V=CDandQ(ϕ) =Q(i), by [HM] the only possibility is that G=2B2(8). /square
Now we are ready to prove the second main result of the paper:
Theorem 8.4. For the geometric monodromy group G=Ggeomof the sheafF(q,f)in(4.1.3), of
rankD= 2n(22n+1−1), eitherG= SLDorG=2B2(q)withq= 22n+1. Furthermore, for any
r|t(q), the geometric monodromy group of the descent G(q,f,r)is also equal to G.
Proof.SupposeGis inﬁnite. Then the statements follow from Theorem 8.2.
From now on, assume that Gis ﬁnite. Then G=S=2B2(q) by Theorem 8.3. Since for any
r|t(q), the geometric monodromy group of G(q,f,r) containsGand is contained in the geometric
monodromy group HofF(q,f,t(q)), it suﬃces to show that H=S.
First, note that the ∞-slope ofG(q,f,t(q)) isσ= (q0+ 1)/DandD+ 1 = (q0+ 1)t(q), so
gcd(D,q0+ 1) = 1. It follows from [Ka1, Proposition 1.14] that I(∞) acts irreducibly on V, of
dimensionD=q0(q−1). Since the image JofI(∞) is cyclic of p′-order modulo the image Qof

non-isomorphic q−1 simpleQ-summands on V, each of dimension q0.
Sinceq= 22n+1, using [Zs] we can ﬁnd a primitive prime divisor ℓ= ppd(2,2n+ 1), and ﬁx
a powerhofg∞that has order ℓ. Clearly, the prime ℓis at least 2 n+ 3, so it is coprime to
2n+1 =|Out(S)|. On the other hand, S≤H≤Aut(S) by (8.3.3). Hence h∈SandQ<S.
We can write h=x(q−1)/ℓ, where on the natural module U=F4
qforS=2B2(q)<Sp(U), the
spectrum of x∈Sconsists of 4 eigenvalues ξ2n,ξ−2n,ξ1−2n, ξ2n−1whereξ∈F2×has orderq−1

ofF2. Suppose that for some 1 ≤a≤2nand for some y∈S, the element yθacentralizes h. Note
thatθasendsxtox2aandh=x(q−1)/ℓtox2a(q−1)/ℓ. It follows that
x2a(q−1)/ℓ=θahθ−a=y−1(yθa)h(yθa)−1y=y−1hy
isS-conjugate to h=x(q−1)/ℓ. On the other hand, it is known [Bur] that if b,c∈Zthenxbandxc
areS-conjugate if and only if c≡±b(mod (q−1)). It follows that ℓdivides 2a±1; in particular, ℓ
divides 22a−1. The primitivity of ℓthen implies that 2 n+1 divides 2 a, a contradiction.
We have shown that CAut(S)(h)≤S. Asg∞centralizes h, it follows that g∞∈S. Hence

Theorems 6.1 and 8.4 imply the following.LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 41
Corollary 8.5. The sheavesFqandGqin§1, of rankD= 2n(22n+1−1), have the same geometric
monodromy group G=Ggeom. Furthermore, either G=2B2(q)withq= 22n+1, orn≥2and
G= SLD.
Remark 8.6. It is plausible that for each q= 22n+1≥32, we can ﬁnd a polynomial f1∈F2[x] of
degree 2n+1 such that the sheaf F(q,f) withf(x) =f1(xt(q)) as in (4.1.3) has inﬁnite geometric
monodromy group, which then is SL Dby Theorem 8.4. Indeed, a Magma calculation shows for
each 2≤n≤25 that Frob 1,F2k(n)has non-integral trace on F(q,x(1+2n)t(q)) for some choice of
k(n)∈Z≥1. For instance, Frob 1,F2k(n)has trace (2 i−7)/2 for (n,(k(n)) = (2,7), (5i+ 3)/2 for
(n,k(n)) = (3,5), (7−3i)/4 for(n,k(n)) = (4,7), and5/2 for(n,k(n)) = (5,7). Infact, forinﬁnitely
many integers n≥2, we oﬀer in Theorem 9.18 a construction of a sheaf F(q,f) withGgeom= SLD.

ﬁnite group Swith (|A|,|S|) = 1, then there exists a canonical bijection∗: IrrA(S)→Irr(C), where
C=CS(A) is the ﬁxed-points subgroup and Irr A(S) is the set of A-invariant irreducible characters
ofS. (See [Is3, Chapter 13].) Since the map is canonical, it is no t diﬃcult to see that Q(θ) =Q(θ∗),
whereQ(θ) is the ﬁeld of values of θ. (See [Is3, Problem 3.1].)
Suppose now that S=2B2(2n), wherenis odd. Then it is well-known that Sadmits a ﬁeld
automorphism aof ordern. Assume further that ( m,|S|) = 1 for some divisor m >1 ofn.
ConsiderA=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔an/m/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔∼=Cm. Ifm=n, thenC=CS(A) =2B2(2)∼=C5⋊C4has 5 irreducible
characters; two of its four linear characters are rational, the others have ﬁeld of values Q(i). It also
has a rational irreducible character of degree 4. In particu lar, it follows that Irr( S) has exactly 5
irreducible A-invariant characters, and exactly two of them have ﬁeld of v aluesQ(i). On the other
hand, ifm<n, thenC=CS(A) =2B2(2n/m) has exactly 2 irreducible A-invariant characters with
ﬁeld of values Q(i), namely the ones of degree ( r−1)/radicalbig
r/2 withr:= 2n/m; see [Bur]. This proves
the following.
Lemma 9.1. Suppose that S=2B2(2n), wherenis odd. Assume further that (m,|S|) = 1for
a divisorm >1ofn, and letAbe the subgroup of ﬁeld automorphisms of Sof orderm. Let
C=CS(A). Ifθ∈IrrA(S)has ﬁeld of values Q(i), thenθ∗has degree (r−1)/radicalbig
r/2withr:= 2n/m.
Lemma 9.2. Suppose that Ais a cyclic group of order macting faithfully and coprimely on S.
Letθ∈Irr(S)beA-invariant, C=CS(A), and letη∈Irr(C)be theA-Glauberman correspondent
ofθ. LetG=S⋊Abe the semidirect product, and let ψ∈Irr(G)be an extension of θ. Consider
x∈G/integerdivideSsuch that/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔x,S/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔=G.
(i)Ifηis linear, then|ψ(x)|= 1.
(ii)In all cases, there exist a root of unity γ∈C×of order dividing 2mandc∈Csuch that
ψ(x) =γη(c).
Proof.Letψ∈Irr(G) be the canonical extension of θtoG. (This is the unique extension ψsuch
that the determinantal order is coprime with |A|, see [Is3, Corollary 6.28]). Since every extension
ofθtoGis a multiple of ψby a linear character λofG/S, we may assume that ψ=λψ0, where
ψ0is the canonical extension.
Observe that mdivides the order of x. Sincemis coprime to|S|, we can write x=cb=bc,
withbbeing aπ-element and cbeing aπ′-element, where πis the set of prime divisors of m. Also
|b|=m, andS∋xm=bmcm=cm, implyingc∈Ssince gcd(m,|S|) = 1. Moreover, G=S⋊/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔b/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔,42 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP

13.6]
ψ0(x) =ψ0(cb) =ǫη(c),
whereǫ=±1. Hence,ψ(x) =γη(c), whereγ=ǫλ(x) andλ(x)m= 1. /square
Since each of the two irreducible characters of S:=2B2(q) of degree ( q−1)/radicalbig
q/2 has ﬁeld of
valuesQ(i) and is Aut( S)-invariant, Lemmas 9.1 and 9.2 imply the following.
Corollary 9.3. Letq= 2nwith2∤nand letθbe either of the two irreducible characters of
S:=2B2(q)of degree (q−1)/radicalbig

nis coprime to|S|, then|ψ(x)|= 1for any extension ψofθtoGand for any x∈G/integerdivideSwith
G=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔x,S/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔.
We remark that the character θin Corollary 9.3 has a canonical extension to G. Indeed, by [N1,
Theorem A], there exists a unique ψ∈Irr(G) such that the ﬁeld of values of ψisQ(i). In particular,
notice that the restriction ψtoCnis rational-valued.
Insomenon-coprimesituations, we can usethefollowing sta tement. Thisalso follows from results
in [Da, §9], but in the situation under consideration, our approach i s more straightforward.
Lemma 9.4. Suppose that G=SA, whereA=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔a/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔,S⊳ GandA∩S= 1. LetC=CS(A), and
assume that χ∈IrrA(S)has an extension ψ∈Irr(G)such thatψAis rational-valued. Suppose that
for everyx∈G/integerdivideS, there exists some g∈Gsuch thatxg=cbfor somec∈Candb∈A. Then
there exist a character θ∈Irr(C)and a sign ǫ=±such thatψ(cb) =ǫθ(c)for everyc∈Cand

Thusθis a virtual character of C. We claim that [ θ,θ] = 1. LetTbe a set of representatives for

Corollary 9.5. Letq= 2nwith2∤nand letθbe either of the two irreducible characters of
S:=2B2(q)of degree (q−1)/radicalbig
q/2. Thenθextends toG= Aut(S)∼=S⋊Cnand|ψ(x)|= 1for
any extension ψofθtoGand for any x∈G/integerdivideSwithG=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔x,S/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔.
Proof.We adapt the notation of [Da, §9] to ours. We know that CS(A) =B⋊R, whereB=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔β/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔
has order 5, and Ris a cyclic group of order 4. Now, let G′=NG(B) =S′⋊A, whereS′=NS(B).
LetG0be the set of x∈Gsuch that/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔xS/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔=G/S, and letG′
0be the set of x∈G′such that
/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔xS′/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔=G′/S′. By [Da, Lemma 9.3], S′=C⋊R, whereCis a cyclic group described there.
By [Da, Proposition 9.7], G′
0is a trivial intersection subset of Gwith normalizer G′. In Dade’s
language, it satisﬁes (6.4) of [Da]. In particular, by [Da, L emma 6.5],
G0=/uniondisplay
τ∈T(G′

is a disjoint union, where G=/uniontext
τ∈TG′τis a disjoint union. (In that lemma right cosets are used.)
In particular, if x∈G′
0andηis a class function of G′, then
ηG(x) =η(x).
By [Da, Theorem 9.8], θnaturally corresponds to some irreducible character η∈IrrA(S′), which
therefore has ﬁeld of values Q(i). Now,Sonly has two A-invariant irreducible characters with ﬁeld
of values Q(i), so using the inverse of Dade’s natural correspondence fro m that theorem, necessarily
ηis one of the two linear characters of S′/C=R.

Lemma 9.6. LetS✁G <GL(V)∼=GLd(C), whereGis ﬁnite,S=2B2(q),D=q0(q−1)with
q0= 2n, q= 22n+1, andV=CDis irreducible over S. Suppose that Gcontains two elements g0,g1
such that Trace(g0) =±i,Trace(g1) =±1, andg1∈g0S. Suppose in addition that the trace of
every element in Z(G)belongs to Q(i). Theng0andg1both induce non-inner automorphisms of S.
Proof.Assume the contrary. As g1∈g0S,g0induces an inner automorphism of S. Hence we can
writeg0=zsfor somes∈Sand somez∈CG(S) =Z(G). SinceGis ﬁnite,zhas ﬁnite order,
whencez=ζ·idVfor some root of unity ζ. By assumption, ζ∈Q(i), whenceζ4= 1.
First suppose that ζ=±1. Then Trace( s) =ζ−1Trace(g0) =±i, but this is impossible for any
element in S, see [Suz]. Hence, ζ=±i. Recalling that g1∈g0S, we can write g1=g0t=zstfor
somet∈S. In such a case, Trace( st) =ζ−1Trace(g1) =±i, and we again arrive at a contradiction

for those local systems F(q,f) in which the polynomial f(x) of degree ( q0+1)t(q) lies inF2[x] and

Furthermore, for any ﬁnite extension k/F2and anyt∈k,|Trace(Frob t,k|F(q,f))|≤√#k.
Proof.The trace at time 0 ∈F2is−1
(1−(−1)ni)times the sum
ψ2[0,0]+ψ2[1,A] = 1+(−1)Ai,
while the trace at time 1 ∈F2is−1
(1−(−1)ni)times the sum
ψ2[0,0]+ψ2[1,A+1] = 1+(−1)A+1i.
If (−1)A=−(−1)n, these traces are respectively −1 and−(−1)ni. If (−1)A= (−1)n, these traces
are respectively−(−1)niand−1. For the second statement, note that Trace(Frob t,k|F(q,f)) is a
sum of #kterms, each of absolute value 1, divided by a clearing factor of absolute value√#k,
hence it has absolute value ≤√#k. /square
Theorem 9.8. Letn∈Z≥1andq= 22n+1. Suppose the Airy sheaf F(q,f)deﬁned in (4.1.3)
withq= 22n+1,f(x)∈F2[x], andf(0) = 0, has ﬁnite geometric monodromy group S. Then the
following statements hold for Sand the arithmetic monodromy group G:=Garith,F2ofF(q,f)over
F2.
(i)S=2B2(q). Furthermore, Ginduces non-inner automorphisms of S,G=Z(G)×Rfor some
S <R≤Aut(S) =S⋊C2n+1, andZ(G)≤C4.
(ii)If2n+1is coprime to|S|, thenG∼=Z(G)×Aut(S).
(iii)Suppose that|Trace(Frob 0,Fq2)|=q0:= 2n. ThenG∼=Z(G)×Aut(S). Moreover,|Z(G)|≤2
ifTrace(Frob 0,Fq2) =−q0orTrace(Frob 0,Fq) =±q0i, andZ(G) = 1ifFrob1,F2has odd order.
Proof.(i) By Theorem 8.4, the geometric monodromy group of F(q,f) isS=2B2(q) in its irre-
ducible representation of degree D=q0(q−1). By Lemma 9.7, for the images g0of Frob 0,F2and
g1of Frob 1,F2inG, one has trace±iand the other has trace ±1. Note that g1∈g0S, and since G
is ﬁnite, the traces of all elements in Gbelong to Q(i) by Chebotarev density. By Lemma 9.6, g0
induces a non-inner automorphism of S.
Recall that Out( S)∼=C2n+1. ThenGprojects onto a subgroup S⋊Cmof Aut(S) with kernel
CG(S) =Z(G), for some divisor m >1 of 2n+ 1. Again, each element in Z(G) acts as a scalar
αonCDand has trace a root of unity belonging to Q(i), whenceα4= 1, and thus Z(G)≤C4.
Now (G/S)/(Z(G)S/S)∼=G/Z(G)S∼=Cmis cyclic, and Z(G)/S≤Z(G/S). It follows that G/S
is abelian of order m|Z(G)|, with cyclic quotient of odd order mand a cyclic 2-subgroup Z(G)S/S
of order|Z(G)|. HenceG/S=R/S×Z(G)/S, withR∼=S⋊Cm. The composition factors of Rare
Sand cyclic groups of odd order (dividing m), soR∩Z(G) = 1 andG=Z(G)×R.
(ii) Now assume that 2 n+ 1 is coprime to |S|, butm <2n+ 1. Letψbe the character of
R=S⋊Cmacting on the sheaf, which extends the character θofS. Letηdenote the Glauberman
correspondent of θas in Lemma 9.2, in particular, it has degree ( r−1)/radicalbig
r/2 forr:= 2(2n+1)/m≥8.
We can write g0=zh0andg1=zh1for someh0,h1∈Randz∈Z(G) (recallg0S=g1S). Nowz
acts as a root of unity βwithβ4= 1, andψ(hj) =γjη(cj) withcj∈C=2B2(r) andγ2m
j= 1 for
j= 0,1 by Lemma 9.2. Since η(cj),β,ψ(gj)∈Q(i), we see that γj∈Q(i). Butγ2m
j= 1 and 2 ∤m,
soγj=±1.LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 45
Note that, since r≥8, the character ηdoes not take value ±i, see [Suz]. Without loss we may
assumeψ(g0) =±1 andψ(g1) =±i. Now, ifβ=±i, thenη(g0) =ψ(g0)/(βγ0) =±i, which
is impossible. On the other hand, if β=±1, thenη(g1) =ψ(g1)/(βγ1) =±i, which is again
impossible. Hence m= 2n+1, as stated.
(iii) By assumption, |ϕ(g4n+2
0)|=q0, whereϕis the character of Gacting onF(q,f). Using
G=Z(G)×R, we again write g0=zh0withz∈Z(G) acting onF(q,f) as a root of unity β, and
h0∈R. ThenZ(G) =/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔z/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔sinceG=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔g0,S/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔, andβ4= 1. Nows:=h2n+1
0∈SasR/S ֒→C2n+1,
and|ϕ(s2)|=q0. Checking the character table of S[Bur], we see that |s2|= 2 or 4 and thus sis a
2-element. But every 2-element of Shas order dividing 4, so |s|= 4. Hence we can write |h0|= 4e
for somee|(2n+1).
Suppose that e<2n+1, whence e≤(2n+1)/3. Thenge
0is the image of Frob 0,2e, and so
q0= 2n>2(2n+1)/6≥2e/2≥|ϕ(ge
0)|=|ϕ(he
0)|
by Lemma 9.7. On the other hand, since R/S ֒→C2n+1andhe
0has order 4, he
0∈Sand hence
|ϕ(he
0)|=q0, a contradiction. Thus |h0|= 4(2n+1). Note that|CS(s2)|=q2, hence|CG(s2)|has
order dividing q2|Z(G)|·|R/S|. Buth0belongs to CG(s2) and has order 4(2 n+1); thus (2 n+1)
divides|R/S|and soR= Aut(S).
SinceG=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔g1,S/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔, the assumption that the image g1of Frob 1,F2has odd order implies that

Thenβ=±i. In the former case,

and thuss∈Shas trace±q0, which is again impossible, cf. [Bur]. /square

(ii)|Trace(Frob 0,Fq2|Fq)|2= #Ker( Fq2) = #Ker( Fq) =q/2.
Proof.We ﬁrst observe that gcd( t(q),q2−1) = 1. To see this, note that t(q) =q+1−2q0divides
q2+1 (indeed ( q+1−2q0)(q+1+2q0) =q2+1), while gcd( q2−1,q2+1) = gcd( q2−1,2) = 1.

In Witt vector addition in F2-algebras, using the fact that R(x) is an additive polynomial, we get

Proof.(i) Proposition 9.9 implies that Trace(Frob 0,Fq|Fq) lies in Z[i] (because the only possible
non-integrality is at the unique place of Q(i) over 2, where this trace and its complex conjugate
have the same 2-adic ord). Furthermore, we can work with trac es overHqinstead ofFq.
Let us denote by Fthe absolute Frobenius x/ma√s⊔o→x2, and deﬁne
Rn(x) :=n/summationdisplay
i=1Fi(x), Vn(x) := [x,xRn(x)] = [x,x/parenleftbign/summationdisplay

Consider the non-normalized sum
RawTrace(Frob 0,Fq|Fq) :=−/summationdisplay
x∈Fqψ2/parenleftbig
TraceFq/F2(Vn(x))/parenrightbig
,
so that
RawTrace(Frob 0,Fq|Fq) = (1−(−1)ni)2n+1Trace(Frob 0,Fq|Fq).
(ii) To explain the idea of the proof, consider ﬁrst the case w hen 2n+1 is an odd prime p. Then
F2p/F2has degreep, andF2p/integerdivideF2is the disjoint union of F-orbits of length p. On each such F-orbit,48 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
the value of Trace Fq/F2(Vn(x)) is constant, and this constant value is then repeated ptimes as we
sum over this orbit. So we have a congruence modulo pZ[i]:

TraceFq/F2(Vn(1))/parenrightbig
≡−ψ2/parenleftbig
TraceFq/F2[0,0]/parenrightbig
−ψ2/parenleftbig
TraceFq/F2[1,n]/parenrightbig
(remembering that Fq/F2has odd degree p, and both Vn(0),Vn(1) are already F2-rational)
≡−ψ2(p[0,0])−ψ2(p[1,(p−1)/2]) =−1−ψ2([1,(p−1)/2])p=−1−(i1+(p−1))p=−1−ip2=−1−i.
So when 2n+1 =p, we have a congruence modulo pZ[i]:
(1−(−1)(p−1)/2i)pTrace(Frob 0,Fq|Fq)≡−1−i.
Multiplying both sides by (1+( −1)(p−1)/2i)p, we get a congruence modulo pZ[i]:
2pTrace(Frob 0,Fq|Fq)≡−(1+i)(1+(−1)(p−1)/2i)p.
Ifp≡1(mod 4), the right side is
−(1+i)p+1=−(2i)(2i)(p−1)/2=−(2i)2(p−1)/2i(p−1)/2.
Ifp≡3(mod 4), the right side is
−(1+i)(1−i)p=−2(1−i)p−1=−2(−2i)(p−1)/2= 2(p+1)/2i(p−1)/2.
Recalling that 2p≡2(modp), and that ( p−1)/2 =n, we get a congruence modulo pZ[i]:
Trace(Frob 0,Fq|Fq)≡/braceleftbigg
−i2ni(p−1)/2,ifp≡1(mod 4),
2ni(p−1)/2,ifp≡3(mod 4).
Thus
(9.10.1) Trace(Frob 0,Fq|Fq)≡−ǫp2ni,
whereǫpis given by i(p−1)/2= (−1)(p−1)/4= (−1)(p2−1)/8whenp≡1(mod 4), and by i(p+1)/2=
(−1)(p+1)/4= (−1)(p2−1)/8whenp≡3(mod 4). Thus in both cases ǫpis the Legendre symbol/parenleftbig2
p/parenrightbig
= (−1)(p2−1)/8.
In view of Proposition 9.9, Trace(Frob 0,Fq|Fq) is either 0 or an element of Z[i] of absolute value
2n. It cannot be 0 because of (9.10.1). So it must be one of ±2nor±2ni. Of these four possibilities,
only−ǫp2niis congruent modulo pZ[i] to−ǫp2ni(this is just the statement that for an odd prime
p, the four powers of iare distinct modulo pZ[i]).
(iii) We now turn to the general case, where we proceed by indu ction on the total number
(counting multiplicity) of primes dividing 2 n+1. Thus we write
2n+1 =ps, s= 2a+1, p= 2b+1,witha,b≥1 andpprime.
We will need to deal with both F2psandF2s. To simplify notation, let us write
Q:= 2ps, q′:= 2s.
Here
ps=s(2b+1) = 2bs+s= 2(sb+a)+1.LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 49
The idea is that FQ/integerdivide Fq′is the disjoint union of Fs-orbits, each of length p, and on each of
these orbits, the value of Trace FQ/F2(Vsb+a(x)) is constant, and this constant value is then repeated
ptimes as we sum over this orbit. Thus we get a congruence modul opZ[i]:
RawTrace(Frob 0,FQ|FQ)≡−/summationdisplay
x∈Fq′ψ2/parenleftbig
TraceFQ/F2(Vsb+a(x))/parenrightbig
.
But forx∈Fq′, the trace from FQdown to Fq′is just multiplication by p, so
TraceFQ/F2(Vsb+a(x)) = Trace Fq′/F2(pVsb+a(x)).
Suppose ﬁrst that bis even, i.e. that p≡1(mod 4). Recall 4[ x,y] = 0. So for x∈Fq′,
pVsb+a(x) =Vsb+a(x) = [x,xRa(x)+x/parenleftbigsb+a/summationdisplay
i=a+1Fi(x)/parenrightbig

= [x,xRa(x)+x/parenleftbig

where the last equality holds because bis even. So in this even bcase,
RawTrace(Frob 0,FQ|FQ)≡RawTrace(Frob 0,Fa|Fq′)(modpZ[i]).
Suppose now that bis odd, i.e. that p≡−1(mod 4). Then for x∈Fq′,
pVsb+a(x) =−Vsb+a(x) =−[x,xRa(x)+x/parenleftbigsb+a/summationdisplay
i=a+1Fi(x)/parenrightbig

= [x,xRa(x)]+[0,x2+xTraceFq′/F2(x)] =Va(x)+[0,x2+xTraceFq′/F2(x)].
But the term [0 ,x2+xTraceFq′/F2(x)] has
TraceFq′/F2/parenleftbig
[0,x2+xTraceFq′/F2(x)]/parenrightbig
= [0,TraceFq′/F2/parenleftbig
x2+xTraceFq′/F2(x)/parenrightbig
] = [0,0],
where the last equality holds because Trace Fq′/F2(x2) = Trace Fq′/F2(x) = (Trace Fq′/F2(x))2.So in
this oddbcase as well, also
RawTrace(Frob 0,FQ|FQ)≡RawTrace(Frob 0,Fa|Fq′)(modpZ[i]).
We have shown that
(9.10.2) (1−(−1)sb+ai)psTrace(Frob 0,FQ|FQ)≡(1−(−1)ai)sTrace(Frob 0,Fq′|Fq)(modpZ[i]).
By the induction hypothesis,
(9.10.3) Trace(Frob 0,Fq′|Fq′) =−ǫs2ai.
The clearing factors are invertible modulo pZ[i]. We next show that the clearing factors are equal
modulopZ[i]. Their ratio is
(1−(−1)sb+ai)ps
(1−(−1)ai)s=(1−(−1)sb+ai)ps(1+(−1)ai)s

Ifbis odd, then ( p+1)/2 is even, and this ratio is

Ifb= (p−1)/2 is even, this ratio is
(1−(−1)ai)(p−1)s= (−2(−1)ai)s(p−1)/2= 2s(p−1)/2is(p−1)/2.
Letχp,quadbethequadraticcharacterof F×

tio of clearing factors modulo pZ[i] isχp,quad(2)is(p−1)/2whenp≡1(mod 4), and χp,quad(2)is(p+1)/2
whenp≡3(mod 4). Next, when p≡1(mod 4),
i(p−1)/2=χp,quad(2).
Whenp≡3(mod 4),
i(p+1)/2=χp,quad(2).
Assis odd, we ﬁnd that in all cases the ratio of clearing factors i s 1(modpZ[i]), as stated. Hence
(9.10.2) and (9.10.3) imply the congruence
Trace(Frob 0,FQ|FQ)≡Trace(Frob 0,Fq′|Fq′) =−ǫs2ai(modpZ[i]).
Note that
2sb= (2(p−1)/2)s≡χp,quad(2)s=χp,quad(2) =ǫp(modp).
Hence
ǫps2sb+a≡ǫpsǫp2a=ǫs2a(modp)
by multiplicativity of the Jacobi symbol. It follows that
Trace(Frob 0,FQ|FQ)≡−ǫps2sb+ai(modpZ[i]).
This congruence shows that Trace(Frob 0,FQ|FQ) is nonzero, so by Proposition 9.9 it is one of ±2sb+a
or±2sb+ai. Again, of these four possibilities, only −ǫps2niis congruent modulo pZ[i] to−ǫps2ni,
and the induction step is complete. /square
Proposition 9.11. Forq= 22n+1, consider the Airy sheaf Fq. Then for any subﬁeld kofFq
|Trace(Frob 1,k|Fq)|2= 1.
Proof.Letkbe a subﬁeld of Fq2. Note that N:= (q+ 2q0+ 1)q2/2 divides (q2+ 1)q2and so is
coprime toq2−1. Hence the map x→xNis a bijection on k, and it sends xt(q)tox(q2+1)q2/2=xfor
anyx∈k. As in the proof of Proposition 9.10, let us denote by Fthe absolute Frobenius x/ma√s⊔o→x2.
For each integer j≥0, we deﬁne

i=1Fi(x).
Consider the non-normalized sum

whereV(x) = [x,xRn(x)+xN]. Then we have
RawTrace(Frob 1,k|Fq) = (1−(−1)ni)deg(k/F2)Trace(Frob 1,k|Fq).
We now take kto be a subﬁeld of Fq. We examine the function x/ma√s⊔o→xNonk. This function
depends only on N(mod (q−1)). Then
N≡(1+1+2q0)q/2 = (2+2q0)q/2 =q+qq0≡1+q0= 1+2n(mod (q−1)).
Thus ifx∈k, thenxN=xFn(x), and hence
V(x) = [x,xRn(x)+xN] = [x,xRn(x)+xFn(x)] = [x,xRn−1(x)].LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 51
At this point, we repeat the van der Geer-van der Vlugt argume nt of Theorem 9.9. We ﬁnd that
ifkis a subﬁeld of Fq, then

with
Ker′(k) :=/braceleftbig

.
The key observation is that for ka subﬁeld of Fq, Ker′(k) ={0}.Indeed, since
0∈Ker′(k)⊆Ker′(Fq),
it suﬃces to show that Ker′(Fq) ={0}.But forx∈Ker′(Fq),
TraceFq/F2(x) =/parenleftbig2n−2/summationdisplay
i=0Fi(x)/parenrightbig
+F2n−1(x)+F2n(x) =F2n−1(x)+F2n(x).
Thus forx∈Ker′(Fq), Trace Fq/F2(x) =F2n−1(x+F(x)). As Trace Fq/F2(x)∈F2, this gives
TraceFq/F2(x) =x+x2.
If Trace Fq/F2(x) = 0, then x+x2= 0, i.e.x∈F2, soxis 0 or 1. Of these, only x= 0 has
TraceFq/F2(x) = 0. If Trace Fq/F2(x) = 1, then x+x2= 1 and so F2(x) =F4. ButF4is not a subﬁeld
ofFq, which has odd degree 2 n+1 over F2. So in this second case, there are no possible x.

Proposition 9.12. Forq= 22n+1and the Airy sheaf Fq,
Trace(Frob 1,Fq|Fq) =−1.
Proof.(i) The quantity Trace(Frob 1,k|Fq) lies inQ(i) and is integral outside the unique place over
2, so by Proposition 9.11, Trace(Frob 1,Fq|Fq) is one of{1,−1,i,−i}. For any odd prime p, these
four elements are distinct modulo pZ[i]. We proceed by induction on the total number (counting
multiplicity) of primes in the factorization of 2 n+1.
For the induction base, suppose that k=Fq=F2p. ThenFq/integerdivideF2is the disjoint union of F-orbits
of length divisible by p. On each such F-orbit, the value of Trace Fq/F2(V(x)) is constant, and this
constant value is then repeated a multiple of ptimes as we sum over this orbit. So we have a
congruence modulo pZ[i]:

=−1−(i1+(p+1))p=−1−ip2+2p=−1+i.52 ALP ¨OGE, KATZ, NAVARRO, O’BRIEN, AND TIEP
So for Frob 1,Fq, we have a congruence modulo pZ[i]:
(1−(−1)(p−1)/2i)pTrace(Frob 1,Fq|Fq) = RawTrace(Frob 1,Fq|Fq)≡−1+i.
Multiplying both sides by (1+( −1)(p−1)/2i)p, we get a congruence modulo pZ[i]:
2pTrace(Frob 0,Fq|Fq)≡−(1−i)(1+(−1)(p−1)/2i)p.
Ifp≡3(mod 4), the right side is
−(1−i)p+1=−(2i)(p+1)/2=−2(p+1)/2(−1)(p+1)/4≡−2(−1)(p2−1)/8+(p+1)/4=−2(modp).
Ifp≡1(mod 4), the right side is −(1−i)(1+i)p, which is
−2(1+i)s−1=−2(2i)(p−1)/2=−2(p+1)/2(−1)(p−1)/4≡−2(−1)(p2−1)/8+(p−1)/4=−2(modp).
Thus in both cases qTrace(Frob 1,Fq|Fq)≡−2(modpZ[i]). Using Proposition 9.11, we conclude
that Trace(Frob 1,Fq|Fq) =−1 in this case.
(ii) Suppose now that 2 n+1 =pswith an odd prime pand an odd integer s. Then just as in
(iii) of the proof of Proposition 9.10 we write
s= 2a+1, p= 2b+1, ps= 2(sb+a)+1.
We will need to deal with both F2psandF2s. To simplify notation, let us write
Q:= 2ps, q′:= 2s.
Then, just as in the proof of Proposition 9.11,
RawTrace(Frob 1,FQ|FQ) =−/summationdisplay
x∈FQψ2(Trace FQ/F2([x,Rsb+a−1(x)])).
The elements of FQ/integerdivideFq′fall intoF-orbits of length p, and the elements from each of these orbits
have the same Trace FQ/F2([x,Rsb+a−1(x)]). So we get a congruence modulo pZ[i]
RawTrace(Frob 1,FQ|FQ)≡−/summationdisplay
x∈Fq′ψ2(Trace FQ/F2([x,Rsb+a−1(x)]))
=−/summationdisplay
x∈Fq′ψ2(Trace Fq′/F2(p[x,Rsb+a−1(x)])).
Notice that for x∈Fq′,
Rsb+a−1(x) =Ra−1(x)+bTraceFq′/F2(x).
Suppose ﬁrst that p≡1(mod 4). Then bis even,
p[x,Rsb+a−1(x)] = [x,Rsb+a−1(x)] = [x,xRa−1(x)],
and hence
RawTrace(Frob 1,FQ|FQ)≡RawTrace(Frob 1,Fq′|Fq′)(modpZ[i])
whenp≡1(mod 4).
Suppose next that p≡−1(mod 4). Since bis odd,
p[x,Rsb+a−1(x)] =−[x,Rsb+a−1(x)] = [x,x2+Rsb+a−1(x)]
= [x,x2+xTraceFq′/F2(x)+xRa−1(x)]
= [x,xRa−1(x)]+[0,x2+xTraceFq′/F2(x)].LOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 53
But forx∈Fq′, Trace Fq′/F2annihilates x2+xTraceFq′/F2(x), so again
RawTrace(Frob 1,FQ|FQ)≡RawTrace(Frob 1,Fq′|Fq′)(modpZ[i])
whenp≡−1(mod 4).
It remains only to show that the ratio of clearing factors is 1 (modpZ[i]) in both cases. When
p≡1(mod 4), ( p−1)/2 is even, and this ratio is

/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔s,S/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔= Aut(S). Then|s|divides5(2n+1).
Proof.LetG:= Sp4(F2). It is well known that there is a Steinberg endomorphism σ:G →G
such thatσ2is the standard Frobenius map ( aij)/ma√s⊔o→(a2

Gσ2n+1:={X∈G|σ2n+1(X) =X}, which is then σ-invariant. Letting σalso denote its action on
S, we can write Aut( S) =/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔σ,S/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔. Without loss, we may assume Ss=Sσ−1, and write s=xσ−1.

and[Garith,˜Fq,k:Ggeom,˜Fq] = deg(Fq/k)whenk⊆Fq.
Proof.Part (i) follows from Propositions 9.9, 9.10, and Theorem 9. 8(iii).
(ii) Letgdenote the image of Frob 1,F2inGarith,F2. As/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔g,Ggeom/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔=C×Aut(S) forS:=2B2(q),
we can write g=zswithC=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔z/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔≤C2ands∈Aut(S)∼=S⋊C2n+1. The central element zacts
onFqas the scalar ξ, whereξ= 1 if|C|= 1 andξ=−1 if|C|= 2. The ﬁniteness of Ggeomimplies
thatGarith,F2is ﬁnite, and so Trace( gm) is a Gaussian integer for any m∈Z. Now Proposition 9.12
implies that
(9.14.1) Trace( s2n+1) =ξTrace(g2n+1) =−ξ,
and note that t:=s2n+1∈S.
Also note that since Aut( S) =/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔s,S/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔,shas order 2 n+1 modulo S, whence|s|=e(2n+1) for
somee∈Z≥1, whence|t|=e. Inspecting the character table of S[Bur] and using (9.14.1), we see
thate=|t|is odd and greater than 1; in fact edividesq−2q0+1 ifξ= 1 andedividesq+2q0+1
ifξ=−1, whereq0:= 2n. It follows that|s|=e(2n+1) is odd. By Lemma 9.13, e>1 divides 5,
soe= 5; in particular, |s|= 5(2n+1). An easy computation shows that 5 |(q−2q0+1) precisely
whenn≡1,2(mod 4) (equivalently, 2 n+ 1≡±3(mod 8)), and 5 |(q+ 2q0+ 1) precisely when
n≡0,3(mod 4) (equivalently, 2 n+ 1≡±1(mod 8)). Hence the statement follows, and we have
also proved that the image gof Frob 1,F2has order
(9.14.2)/braceleftbigg
10(2n+1),if 2n+1≡±1(mod 8),
5(2n+1),if 2n+1≡±3(mod 8).
Parts (iii) and (iv)( α) follow from (i), (ii), and the facts that Ggeom=2B2(q) andGarith,F2/Ggeom
is cyclic of order |C|(2n+1).
To prove (iv)( β), note that when k⊇F4, the images of π1(A1/k) onFqand˜Fqare the same.
HenceGarith,˜Fq,k=Garith,k=2B2(q) whenever k⊇Fq2, whenceGgeom,˜Fq=2B2(q) =S. Now
Garith,˜Fq,F2=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔˜g,S/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔, where ˜gis the image of Frob 1,F2on˜Fq. By its deﬁnition, ˜ g=−g, whereg
is the image of Frob 1,F2onFq, and the proof of (ii) shows (recalling 2 n+ 1≡±1(mod 8)) that

Remark 9.15. Computations in Magma suggest that, for the Airy sheaf Fqwithq= 22n+1, the
Frobenii Frob a,F2jwitha∈F2jand gcd(j,2n+1) = 1, all have traces of absolute value 1. If one
knew thatFqhas geometric monodromy group Ggeom,Fq=2B2(q), then this “absolute value one”
property agrees with Corollary 9.5. Also, for n= 1,2, computations show that Frob 1,F2has order
5(2n+1), and this again agrees with (9.14.2).
On the other hand, the inﬁnite case of the dichotomy, namely Ggeom= SLDwould imply by
Deligne’s equidistribution theorem [KaS, Theorem 9.7.13] that whenjis large enough (compared
toq), some(infactmost)FrobeniiFrob a,F2jwouldhavetracesofabsolutevalue /\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 1. Thisagaingives
some evidence in support of the geometric part of [Ka5, Conje cture 2.2] asserting that Ggeom,Fq=
2B2(q). However, Theorem 9.14(iii) shows that the arithmetic par t of [Ka5, Conjecture 2.2] statingLOCAL SYSTEMS AND SUZUKI GROUPS 55
thatGarith,Fq,F2= Aut(2B2(q)) is false when q= 2mwithm≡±1(mod 8); it should be corrected
in that case by replacing Fqby˜Fqas in (iv)(β) of Theorem 9.14.
9C. Local systems with inﬁnite monodromy groups. Theorem 9.8 allows us to prove the
following criterion for inﬁnite monodromy.
Proposition 9.16. Letn∈Z≥1,q= 22n+1, and consider the Airy sheaf F(q,f)deﬁned in (4.1.3)
withq= 22n+1,f(x)∈F2[x], andf(0) = 0. Suppose that
(i) 2n+1is coprime to|2B2(q)|, and
(ii)there is some odd integer mcoprime to 2n+1such that|Trace/parenleftbig
Frob0,F2m|F(q,f)/parenrightbig
|/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 1.
ThenF(q,f)has inﬁnite geometric monodromy group.
Proof.Assume the contrary: F(q,f) has ﬁnite geometric monodromy group S. By Theorem 9.8,
S=2B2(q) and the arithmetic monodromy group of F(q,f) overF2isG=Z(G)×Aut(S), where
Z(G)≤C4. In particular,|G/S|divides 4(2n+ 1), and so Sequals the arithmetic monodromy
group ofF(q,f) overFq4. Moreover, G=/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔g,S/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔for the image gof Frob 0,F2inG, and we can write
g=zswithz∈Z(G),s∈Aut(S), and Aut( S) =/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔s,S/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔. Applying Corollary 9.5, we see that
|Trace(g)|=|Trace(s)|= 1, a contradiction. /square
Proposition 9.17. Letn∈Z≥2,q:= 22n+1,r:= [(n−1)/2], and deﬁne
f1(x) :=r/summationdisplay
i=0x1+2n−2i.
Consider the sheaf F(q,f)withf(x) :=f1(xt(q))as in(4.1.3). Then for m:= 2[n/2] +1we have
|Trace/parenleftbig
Frob0,F2m|F(q,f)/parenrightbig
|/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 1.
Proof.As in the proof of Proposition 9.9, the starting point is that gcd(t(q),2m−1) = 1. To see
this, note that t(q) =q+1−2q0dividesq4−1, and gcd( q4−1,2m−1) = 2gcd(4(2n+1),m)−1 = 1.
Thus for the ﬁeld k:=F2m, the mapx/ma√s⊔o→xt(q)is bijective on k.
The sheafF(q,f) was built out of the Witt vector/bracketleftbig
xt(q),f1(xt(q)/bracketrightbig
. Let us denote by H(q,f1) the
sheaf built by the same recipe, with same clearing factor, ou t of the Witt vector [ x,f1(x)]. Then
we have
Trace(Frob 0,k|F(q,f)) = Trace(Frob 0,k|H(q,f1)),
precisely because the map x/ma√s⊔o→xt(q)is bijective on k.
Next, as in (9.9.2), we write the input vector [ x,f1(x)] as [x,xR(x)], with
R(x) :=r/summationdisplay
i=0x2n−2i=Fn(x)+Fn−2(x)+...+Fn−2r(x),
andFdenotes the absolute Frobenius. Now wecan repeat the argume nts in theproof of Proposition
9.9, and compute the form Trace k/F2(/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔x,y/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔) onk×kwith/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔x,y/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔:=xy+xR(y)+yR(x) as in (9.9.4).
For anyx,y∈kwe haveFm(x) =x,Fm(y) =y. If 2|n, thenn= 2r+2,m= 2r+3, and
/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔x,y/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔=xy+y/parenleftbigr+1/summationdisplay

So in both cases, the symmetric bilinear form Trace k/F2(/a\}brack⌉⊔l⌉{⊔x,y/a\}brack⌉⊔ri}h⊔) onk×khas kernel consisting of
the elements x∈kwith Trace k/F2(x) = 0, that is, of exactly 2m−1elements. Then the proof of
Proposition 9.9 shows that |Trace/parenleftbig
Frob0,F2m|F(q,f)/parenrightbig
|is either 0 or 2(m−1)/2>1, and hence can
never be equal to 1 (since by hypothesis n≥2, and hence m≥3). /square
Theorem 9.18. Letn∈Z≥2,q:= 22n+1, and consider the sheaf F(q,f)of rankD:= 2n(22n+1−1),
withf(x) =f1(xt(q))andf1(x)as deﬁned in Proposition 9.17. Assume in addition that 2n+1is
coprime to|2B2(q)|; for instance, take 2n+1 =ℓafor any odd prime ℓ/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 5and anya∈Z≥1. Then
the geometric monodromy group of F(q,f)isSLD.
Proof.We ﬁrst apply Proposition 9.9, and note that mis coprime to 2(2 n+ 1). It then follows
from Proposition 9.16 that F(q,f) has inﬁnite geometric monodromy group Ggeom. By Theorem
8.4,Ggeom= SLD.
Suppose that 2 n+1 =ℓafor a prime ℓ, butℓdivides|2B2(q)|. Thenℓdividesq4−1 = 24ℓa−1.
Sinceℓ|(2ℓ−1−1),ℓdivides gcd(24ℓa−1,2ℓ−1−1) = 2gcd(4ℓa,ℓ−1)−1, and soℓdivides 24−1 = 15.
But 3∤|2B2(q)|, sor= 5. /square
More generally, to ensure that 2 n+1 is coprime to |2B2(q)|forq= 22n+1, we can take any nsuch
that 2n+1 =pa1

q4−1 = 24(2n+1)−1. Since gcd( pj−1,4(2n+1)) = gcd( pj−1,4/producttextt

pjdivides 24−1 = 15. But pj/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 5 by assumption, and pj/\⌉}a⊔io\slash= 3 since 3 ∤|2B2(q)|, a contradiction.
