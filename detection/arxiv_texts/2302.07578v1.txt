Abstract. This paper investigates the diﬀerentiability of weak limits of bi-Sobolev
homeomorphisms. Given p > n−1, consider a sequence of homeomorphisms fkwith
positive Jacobians Jfk>0 almost everywhere and supk(/bardblfk/bardblW1,n−1+/bardblf−1
k/bardblW1,p)<
∞. We prove that if fandhare weak limits of fkandf−1
k, respectively, with positive
Jacobians Jf>0 andJh>0 a.e., then h(f(x)) =xandf(h(y)) =yboth hold a.e.
andfandhare diﬀerentiable almost everywhere.
1.Introduction
Let Ω and Ω′be domains, i.e. non-empty connected open sets, in Rnandf∈
W1,p(Ω,Rn) be a mapping from Ω to Ω′. According to classic results of Geometric
analysis, if p > n, the mapping fis diﬀerentiable almost everywhere. This result
was established in 1941 for n= 2 by Cesari [4] and later generalized to arbitrary n
by Calder´ on [2]. The a.e.-diﬀerentiability of continuous and monotone mappings was
studiedfromageometricalperspectivebyV¨ ais¨ al¨ a[29]andRes hetnyak[24,25,26]. This
includes mappings with bounded distortion, also known as quasiregula r mappings, and
mappings with ﬁnite distortion (even for p=n). Further details on these results can
be found in [25, 29]. The results also extend to W1,1-homeomorphisms in dimension
n= 2, as shown by Gehring and Lehto [10], and W1,p-homeomorphisms with p > n−1
ifn≥3, see V¨ ais¨ al¨ a [29] (also Onninen [22, Theorem 1.2 and Example 1.3]).
ForW1,n−1-Sobolev homeomorphisms with n≥3, the a.e.-diﬀerentiability was es-
tablished by considering the integrability of the inner distortion KI∈L1(Ω), where
Jf(x) := detDf(x) is the Jacobian, adj Dfis the adjugate matrix of Dfand

[23, Lemma 2.1] we then obtain that for almost all x∈Ω

and hence fis diﬀerentiable in xby the Stepanov Theorem. Thus, instead of as-
sumptions for distortion, we can directly consider bi-Sobolev homeo morphisms. The
inverse mapping theorem (see e.g. [12, Theorem A.29]) states that if f∈W1,n−1,
Jf>0 a.e., and f−1∈W1,pwithp > n−1, then both fandf−1are diﬀerentiable
almost everywhere (for a more general approach, the reader is r eferred to [31]). How-
ever, Cs¨ ornyei, Hencl, and Mal´ y constructed in Example 5.2 in [5] a homeomorphism
f∈W1,n−1((−1,1)n,Rn),n≥3, withJf>0 a.e. that is nowhere diﬀerentiable and
its inverse f−1∈W1,n−1((−1,1)n,Rn) is also nowhere diﬀerentiable.
In this work, we examine the a.e.-diﬀerentiability of a class of weak limits of home-
omorphisms . This class of mappings is well suited for the calculus of variations ap-
proach and may serve as deformations in Continuum Mechanics mode ls. For further
information, refer to [15, 17, 19]. Weak limits of Sobolev homeomorph isms have re-
ceived signiﬁcant attention in recent years, with various studies co nducted, including
[1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 16].
Here we consider the energy functional
E(f) :=ˆ
Ω|Df(x)|n−1dx+ˆ
Ω′|Df−1(y)|pdy
for bi-Sobolev mappings f: Ω→Ω′such that fis invertible almost everywhere, f∈
W1,n−1(Ω,Rn), andf−1∈W1,p(Ω′,Rn) for some p > n−1.
The main result, which is proven in Section 1.2, reads as follows.
Theorem 1.1. Letn≥2,p > n−1,Ω,Ω′⊂Rnbe bounded domains and fk∈
W1,n−1(Ω,Rn),k= 0,1,2..., be homeomorphisms of ΩontoΩ′withJfk>0a.e. and
sup
kE(fk)<∞.
Assume that f: Ω→Rnis a weak limit of {fk}k∈NinW1,n−1(Ω,Rn)withJf>0a.e.
andh: Ω′→Rnis a weak limit of {f−1
k}k∈NinW1,p(Ω′,Rn)withJh>0a.e. Then for
a.e.x∈Ωwe haveh(f(x)) =xand for a.e. y∈Ω′we havef(h(y)) =y, and both f
andhare diﬀerentiable almost everywhere.
Let us note the following result, which better suits the Calculus of Va riations ap-
proach since it formulates the assumptions only for fk.
Corollary 1.2. Letn≥2,p > n−1,Ω,Ω′⊂Rnbe bounded domains and ϕbe a
positive convex function on (0,∞)with
(1.1) lim

Letfk∈W1,n−1(Ω,Rn),k= 0,1,2..., be homeomorphisms of ΩontoΩ′withJfk>0

and for a.e. y∈Ω′we have f(h(y)) =y, and both fandhare diﬀerentiable almost
everywhere.DIFFERENTIABILITY OF LIMITS OF HOMEOMORPHISMS 3
2.Preliminaries
ByB(c,r), we denote the open euclidean ball with centre c∈Rnand radius r >0,
andS(c,r) stands for the corresponding sphere.
2.1.Topological image and (INV)condition. Althoughaweak limit ofhomeomor-
phisms may not be a homeomorphism, it may possess an invertibility pro perty known
as the (INV) condition. The (INV) condition states, informally, tha t a ballB(x,r)
is mapped inside the image of the sphere f(S(x,r)) and the complement Ω \B(x,r)
is mapped outside f(S(x,r)). This concept was introduced for W1,p-mappings, where
p > n−1, by M¨ uller and Spector [21], although the fact that a ball B(x,r) is mapped
inside the image of a sphere f(S(a,r)) was known in literature before as monotonic-
ity, see [25] and [32, §2]. Suppose that f:S(y,r)→Rnis continuous, we deﬁne the
topological image ofB(x,r) as
(2.1) fT(B(x,r)) :={z∈Rn\f(S(x,r)) : deg(f,S(x,r),z)/\e}atio\slash= 0}
and thetopological image ofxas
fT(x) :=/intersectiondisplay
r>0,r/\egatio\slash∈Nxf∗T(B(x,r))∪f∗(S(x,r)),
whereNxis a null set from the deﬁnition just below.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A mapping f: Ω→Rnsatisﬁes the (INV) condition , provided that
for every x∈Ω there exist a constant rx>0 and an L1-null set Nxsuch that for all
r∈(0,rx)\Nx, the restriction f|S(x,r)is continuous and
(i)f(z)∈fT(B(x,r))∪f(S(x,r)) for a.e. z∈B(x,r),
(ii)f(z)∈Rn\fT(B(x,r)) for a.e. z∈Ω\B(x,r).
Let us note that for a particular representative of a Sobolev mapp ing, Deﬁnition 2.1
allows for some points to escape their destiny, e.g. a null-set inside th e ball may be
mapped outside the image of this ball. Thus, we also consider a strong er version of the
(INV) condition.
Deﬁnition 2.2. A mapping f: Ω→Rnsatisﬁes the strong(INV)condition , provided
that for every x∈Ω there exist a constant rx>0 and an L1-null set Nxsuch that for
allr∈(0,rx)\Nxthe restriction f|S(x,r)is continuous and
(i)f(z)∈fT(B(x,r))∪f(S(x,r)) for every z∈B(x,r),
(ii)f(z)∈Rn\fT(B(x,r)) for every z∈Ω\B(x,r).

Note that the representative f∗isp-quasicontinuous (see remarks after [21, Proposi-
tion 2.8]).
Let now f: Ω→Rnbe aW1,p-weak limit of homeomorphisms fk: Ω→Rnwith
p∈(n−1,n] forn >2 orp∈[1,2] forn= 2. Then by [1, Theorem 5.2] there exists an

Lemma 2.3. Letn≥2andΩ′⊂Rnbe a bounded domain. If h: Ω′→Rnsatisﬁes
the strong (INV)condition, then his monotone for almost all radii, i.e. for y∈Ω′
there exists an L1-null set Nysuch that for all r∈(0,ry)\Nyit holds that oscB(y,r)h≤

holds that his continuous on the sphere S(y,r) andh(z)∈hT(B(y,r))∪h(S(y,r)) for
everyz∈B(y,r). In this case, h(S(y,r)) is a compact set and hT(B(y,r))⊆Rn\A,
whereAis the unbounded component of Rn\h(S(y,r)) (since by the basic properties
of the topological degree [12, p. 48(d)] we have deg( h,S(y,r),ξ) = 0 for all ξ∈A),
and therefore osc B(y,r)h≤oscS(y,r)h.
Further, for y∈Ω′andr >0, and for a.e. t∈[r,2r), it holds that
oscB(y,r)h≤oscB(y,t)h≤oscS(y,t)h.
Then by the Sobolev embedding theorem on spheres [12, Lemma 2.19 ], following the
proof of [12, Theorem 2.24], we obtain that

Remark 2.4. In casep > n,h∗=h∗∗=˜his the continuous representative of h
andh∗is diﬀerentiable almost everywhere [2] and satisﬁes the Lusin (N) con dition
in Ω [18]. Moreover, due to compact embedding of W1,pinto the H¨ older space C0,α,
weak convergence in W1,pimplies uniform convergence on compact sets. With these
properties, the subsequent analysis becomes simpliﬁed, and the de tails are left to the
reader.
3.A.e.-invertibility of f
Since a limit of homeomorphisms may not be a homeomorphism, we need t o deﬁne
a weaker notion of inverse mapping. First recall that a mapping f: Ω→Ω′is called
injective a.e. in domain if there exists a null set Σ ⊂Ω,|Σ|= 0, such that the
restriction f|Ω\Σ: Ω\Σ→f(Ω\Σ) is injective. A mapping f: Ω→Ω′is called
injective a.e. in image if there exists a null set Σ′⊂Ω′,|Σ′|= 0, such that for any
y∈f(Ω)\Σ′the preimage f−1(y) :={x∈Ω :f(x) =y}consists of only one point.
Note that if fis injective a.e. in image and satisﬁes the (N)−1condition, then fis
injective a.e. in domain. If instead fis injective a.e. in domain, fsatisﬁes the (N)
condition, and |Ω′|=|f(Ω)|thenfis injective a.e. in image. We say that h: Ω′→Ω
is the a.e.-inverse to f: Ω→Ω′if for a.e. x∈Ω we have h(f(x)) =xand for a.e.
y∈Ω′we have f(h(y)) =y. Note that if fsatisﬁes the (N)−1condition, then fis
injective a.e. in image if and only if there exists the a.e.-inverse to f.
The following lemma provides some additional conditions that guarant ee the a.e.-
invertibility of fin our setting.DIFFERENTIABILITY OF LIMITS OF HOMEOMORPHISMS 5
Lemma 3.1. Letn≥2,ΩandΩ′be bounded domains in Rn,p > n−1, and let
fk∈W1,n−1(Ω,Rn)be homeomorphismsof ΩontoΩ′withJfk>0. Let also f: Ω→Rn
be a weak limit of {fk}k∈NinW1,n−1(Ω,Rn)withJf>0a.e. Assume also that the
sequence {f−1
k}k∈Nconverges W1,p-weakly to h: Ω′→RnwithJh>0a.e. Then
h∗∗(f(x)) =xa.e. inΩandf(h∗∗(y)) =ya.e. inΩ′.
Proof.Letp > n−1, andﬁxarepresentative of f, whichwedenotebythesamesymbol.
If needed, we pass to a subsequence so that fk→fandf−1
k→hpointwise a.e. Since
his aW1,p-weak limit of Sobolev homeomorphisms with p > n−1, the super-precise
representative h∗∗satisﬁes thestrong (INV)condition [1, Theorem 5.2andLemma 5.3].
Then there exists a set G′
1⊂Ω′of full measure |G′
1|=|Ω′|:Jh∗∗(y)>0 for ally∈G′
1,
h∗∗is injective in G′
1(see [21, Lemma 3.4] and [1, Theorem 1.2]) and f−1
k(y)→h∗∗(y)
for ally∈G′
1.
Step 1.h∗∗(f(x)) =xa.e.: By Lemma 2.3, we know that osc B(y,r)h∗∗−→
r→00 for
a.e.y∈Ω′. Since Jf>0 a.e. (and therefore fsatisﬁes the (N)−1condition),
oscB(f(x),r)h∗∗−→
r→00 for a.e. x∈Ω.
LetG1⊂f−1(G′
1) be a set such that |G1|=|Ω|and for all x∈G1it holds that
fk(x)→f(x) and osc B(f(x),r)h∗∗−→
r→00.
Forx∈G1andr >0, by the pointwise convergence of fkinx∈G1andf−1
kin
f(x)∈G′
1, we can ﬁnd k0∈Nbig enough such that
fk(x)∈B(f(x),r) and f−1
k(f(x))∈B(h∗∗(f(x)),r)
for allk≥k0. Moreover, by [21, Lemma 2.9] (though it is formulated for the prec ise
representative h∗, it holds also for the super-precise representative h∗∗with analogous
proof), there exists a subsequence {fkj}j∈N(that depends on r) and a number j0∈N
big enough such that
oscS(f(x),r)f−1
kj≤oscS(f(x),r)h∗∗+r
for allj≥j0.
Then we have
|f−1
kj(fkj(x))−h∗∗(f(x))| ≤ |f−1
kj(fkj(x))−f−1
kj(f(x))|+|f−1
kj(f(x))−h∗∗(f(x))|
≤oscB(f(x),r)f−1
kj+r≤oscS(f(x),r)f−1
kj+r
≤oscS(f(x),r)h∗∗+r+r≤oscB(f(x),2r)h∗∗+2r.
Therefore, by deﬁnition of G1,
|x−h∗∗(f(x))|=|f−1
kj(fkj(x))−h∗∗(f(x))| ≤lim
r→0(oscB(f(x),2r)h∗∗+2r) = 0
for allx∈G1, which concludes Step 1.
Step 2.f(h∗∗(y)) =ya.e.: We know that h∗∗is injective a.e. on G′
1and both fand
h∗∗satisﬁes the (N)−1condition, so when we set
G′
2:=/parenleftbig
G′
1∩(h∗∗)−1(G1)/parenrightbig
\(h∗∗)−1(f−1(Ω′\G′
1)),
we know it is a set of full measure. Let us take y∈G′
2. Sincef−1
kis a homeomorphism
onto Ω, we can ﬁnd yk∈Ω′such that f−1
k(yk) =h∗∗(y). Therefore,
yk=fk(f−1
k(yk)) =fk(h∗∗(y))→f(h∗∗(y)),
soykconverges to some ˜ y=f(h∗∗(y)). We apply h∗∗to both sides to get h∗∗(˜y) =
h∗∗(f(h∗∗(y))). From y∈G′
2we have that h∗∗(y)∈G1. Sinceh∗∗(f(x)) =xonG1
we geth∗∗(˜y) =h∗∗(f(h∗∗(y))) =h∗∗(y).Now we can have either ˜ y∈G′
1or ˜y /∈G′
1.
In the ﬁrst case, ˜ y=yash∗∗is injective on G′
1, sof(h∗∗(y)) =y. In the other case,
f(h∗∗(y))∈Ω′\G′
1, which is a contradiction to y∈G′

Remark 3.2. Ifp > n, equality h∗∗(f(x)) =xcan be derived easily from
|x−h∗∗(f(x))| ≤ |f−1
k(fk(x))−f−1
k(f(x))|+|f−1
k(f(x))−h∗∗(f(x))|,
using uniform convergence f−1
k⇒h∗∗(up to subsequence) and the Morrey inequality
forf−1
k. The other relation f(h∗∗(y)) =yfollows the same way as above.
Remark 3.3. Sinceboth fandhsatisfythe(N)−1condition, theidentities h(f(x)) =x
a.e. in Ω and f(h(y)) =ya.e. in Ω′hold for arbitrary representatives.
4.Differentiability
First, let us notice the following well-known fact.
Lemma 4.1. Letn≥2,p > n−1andΩ′be a bounded domain in Rn. Ifh∈
W1,p
loc(Ω′,Rn)satisﬁes the strong (INV)condition, then his diﬀerentiable a.e. in Ω′.
Proof.By Lemma 2.3 we have
oscB(y,r)h≤Cr/parenleftbigg
r−nˆ
B(y,2r)|Dh|p/parenrightbigg1/p
,
which implies by setting r=|z−y|that
limsup
z→y|h(z)−h(y)|
|z−y|≤C|Dh(y)|<∞
for any Lebesgue point yof|Dh|pand, therefore, his diﬀerentiable a.e. by the Stepanov
theorem [27], see also [12, Theorem 2.23].
/square
We also need the following modiﬁcation of [12, Lemma A.29], which gives u s the
a.e.-diﬀerentiability of mapping ffrom Theorem 1.1 – but the derivative is only with
respect to a set of full measure.
Lemma 4.2. Letn≥2andΩ,Ω′be bounded domains in Rn. LetΛ⊂Ω,Λ′⊂Ω′be
sets of full measure and h: Ω′→Ωsuch that h: Λ′→Λ =h(Λ′)is diﬀerentiable with
respect to the relative topology in Λ′, i.e. induced by the topology in Rn, andJh(y)>0
for ally∈Λ′. Assume also that h|Λ′is injective, and the inverse mapping f:=h−1is
continuous in Λwith respect to the relative topology in Λ. Thenfis diﬀerentiable on
Λwith respect to the relative topology in ΛandDf(x) = (Dh(f(x)))−1for allx∈Λ.
Proof.Sinceh: Λ′→Λ is a homeomorphism, the proof of this lemma follows the lines
of the proof of [12, Lemma A.29]. We present it here for the convenie nce of the reader.
By the diﬀerentiability of hwe know that for y∈Λ′
(4.1) lim
¯y→y,¯y∈Λ′h(¯y)−h(y)−Dh(y)(¯y−y)
|¯y−y|= 0.
For ¯x,x∈Λ denote ¯ y=f(¯x),y=f(x)∈Λ′, then
h(¯y)−h(y) =h(f(¯x))−h(f(x)) = ¯x−x.
SinceJh(y)>0 we obtain for ¯ yclose enough to ythat
|¯x−x|=|h(¯y)−h(y)| ≈ |Dh(y)(¯y−y)| ≈ |¯y−y|.DIFFERENTIABILITY OF LIMITS OF HOMEOMORPHISMS 7
Then from (4.1) it follows
0 = lim
¯y→y,¯y∈Λ′(Dh(y))−1(h(¯y)−h(y)−Dh(y)(¯y−y))
|y′−y|=
lim
¯y→y,¯y∈Λ′(Dh(y))−1(h(¯y)−h(y))−(¯y−y)
|y′−y|≈
lim
¯x→x,¯x∈Λ(Dh(f(x)))−1(¯x−x)−(f(¯x)−f(x))
|¯x−x|,
which concludes the proof.
/square
The following proposition is a version of an inverse function theorem.
Proposition 4.3. Letn≥2,p > n−1,ΩandΩ′be bounded domains in Rn,Λ⊂Ω
andΛ′⊂Ω′be sets of full measure and h∈W1,p(Ω′,Ω)satisfy the strong (INV)
condition and be diﬀerentiable with Jh(y)>0for anyy∈Λ′. Assume also that the
restriction h|Λ′: Λ′→Λis one-to-one for any y∈Λ′. Then for any y0∈Λ′there
exists a sequence {rm}m∈Nց0such that the topological image hT(B(y0,rm))contains

Figure 1. Mapping hmaps the red sphere S(0,rm) toh(S(0,rm))
(blue); the grey ball B(0,rm/3) does not intersect h(S(0,rm)), since its
distance from 0 is at least rm/2 (denoted by the dotted sphere).
Proof.Without loss of generality, by a translation and a linear change of var iables, we
may assume that y0= 0,h(y0) = 0, and Dh(y0) =Id. Sincehis diﬀerentiable at 0, it
holds that h(y) =y+o(|y|) ify→0. That means that there exists r0>0 such that
(4.2) |h(y)−y| ≤|y|
2for ally∈B(0,r0)⊂Ω′.
Consider a sequence {rm}m∈Nց0 such that his continuous on S(0,rm) and Def-

the super-precise representative h∗∗satisﬁes the strong (INV) condition [1, Theorem
5.2 and Lemma 5.3], is injective a.e. (see [21, Lemma 3.4] and [1, Theor em 1.2]) and
continuous on almost all spheres [11, Lemma 2.19]. By Lemma 4.1, his diﬀerentiable
a.e. in Ω′. Moreover, since Jh(y)>0 a.e. in Ω′, by the change-of-variable formula we
conclude that hsatisﬁes the (N)−1condition.
Step 1. Finding sets Λ, Λ′: Letfbe an arbitrarily ﬁxed representative, and let us
introduce goodsetsG⊂Ω,G′⊂Ω′as
G:={x∈Ω :h∗∗(f(x)) =x} ⊂Ω and G′:={y∈Ω′:f(h∗∗(y)) =y} ⊂Ω′.
It is easy to check that f(G) =G′,h∗∗(G′) =G, and by Lemma 3.1, |G|=|Ω|,
|G′|=|Ω′|. And we deﬁne badsets Σ⊂G, Σ′⊂G′as
Σ :=G\{x∈Ω :Jf(x)>0, fk(x)→f(x)},
Σ′:=G′\{y∈Ω′:h∗∗is diﬀerentiable in y, Jh∗∗(y)>0, f−1
k(y)→h∗∗(y)}.
Clearly|Σ|=|Σ′|= 0. Then very good sets Λ⊂G, Λ′⊂G′are deﬁned by
Λ′:=G′\(Σ′∪f−1(Σ)) and Λ := h∗∗(Λ′).
By Lemma 3.1 and (N)−1condition for fandh∗∗, it is not diﬃcult to see that |Λ′|=
|G′|=|Ω′|,|Λ|=|Ω|andf(Λ) = Λ′.
Step 2.f|Λis continuous : The restriction f|Λ: Λ→Λ′is continuous with respect to
the relative topology in Λ. Indeed, let f|Λbe not continuous in some point x0∈Λ,
then there exists a sequence {xk}k∈N⊂Λ,xk→x0, butf(xk)/notarrowrightf(x0). We set
yk:=f(xk)∈Λ′andy0:= (h∗∗)−1(x0) =f(x0). Since h∗∗|Λ′= (f|Λ)−1, we have
h∗∗(yk)→h∗∗(y0), butyk/notarrowrighty0.
By Proposition 4.3 there exists a sequence {rm}m∈Nց0 such that
B/parenleftBig
h∗∗(y0),rm
3/parenrightBig
⊂(h∗∗)T(B(y0,rm)).
Letmandk0∈Nbe big enough so that inﬁnitely many ykare outside of B(y0,rm)
fork≥k0andh∗∗(yk0)∈B/parenleftbig
h∗∗(y0),rm
6/parenrightbig
. Passing to a subsequence, we can, for now,
assume that yk/∈B(y0,rm) for allk. Then we can ﬁnd r >0 such that
B(yk0,r)∩B(y0,rm) =∅
and, since h∗∗|Λ′is continuous,
h∗∗(B(yk0,r)∩Λ′)⊂B/parenleftBig
h∗∗(yk0),rm
6/parenrightBig
.
Summarizing the above, we obtain
h∗∗(B(yk0,r)∩Λ′)⊂B/parenleftBig
h∗∗(yk0),rm
6/parenrightBig
⊂B/parenleftBig
h∗∗(y0),rm
3/parenrightBig
⊂(h∗∗)T(B(y0,rm)).
Thus, for every
z∈(B(yk0,r)∩Λ′)⊂(Ω′\B(y0,rm))
it holds that h∗∗(z)∈(h∗∗)T(B(y0,rm)), the latter contradicts to the strong (INV)
condition for h∗∗, since a set of positive measure B(yk0,r)∩Λ′from outside of the ball
B(y0,rm) is mapped inside the topological image of this ball.DIFFERENTIABILITY OF LIMITS OF HOMEOMORPHISMS 9
Therefore, fis continuous on Λ with respect to the relative topology, and by
Lemma 4.2, we conclude that fis diﬀerentiable on Λ with respect to the relative
topology.
Step 3.˜fis diﬀerentiable a.e. : It is left to show that a hyper-precise representative
˜f, given by (2.3), is diﬀerentiable at x0∈Λ with respect to Ω. Since Λ is a set of
full measure and fis continuous on Λ with respect to the relative topology, any point
x∈Λ is a Lebesgue point of f, and therefore ˜f=fon Λ.
Fixx0∈Λ andε >0. By diﬀerentiability of fon Λ with respect to the relative
topology, there exists s >0 such that for any x∈B(x0,s)∩Λ it holds that
(4.3)|f(x)−f(x0)−Df(x0)(x−x0)|
|x−x0|=|˜f(x)−˜f(x0)−Df(x0)(x−x0)|
|x−x0|<ε
2,
whereDf(x0) denotes the derivative Df|Λ(x0) with respect to the relative topology.
To prove diﬀerentiability of ˜f, we need to show that for an arbitrary x′close tox0it
holds that
(4.4)|˜f(x′)−˜f(x0)−Df(x0)(x′−x0)|
|x′−x0|< ε.
Ifx′∈Λ, (4.4) follows immediately from (4.3). In the other case, roughly sp eaking,
we want to ﬁnd a point z∈Λ such that|˜f(x′)−˜f(z)|
|x′−x0|and|x′−z|
|x′−x0|are small, and so we can
estimate
|˜f(x′)−˜f(x0)−Df(x0)(x′−x0)|
|x′−x0|
≤|˜f(x′)−˜f(z)|+|Df(x0)(x′−z)|
|x′−x0|+|˜f(z)−˜f(x0)−Df(x0)(z−x0)|
|x′−x0|< ε.
Now we prove the above paragraph rigorously. Let x′∈B/parenleftbig
x0,s
2/parenrightbig
. By (2.3), there
exists a sequence {rk}k∈Nց0 such that rk<2−k|x′−x0|and
(4.5)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle˜f(x′)−1
|B(x′,rk)|ˆ
B(x′,rk)∩Λ˜f(x)dx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle<2−k|x′−x0|.
In the following, we proceed coordination-wise for i∈ {1,...,n}. Denote by ai
kandbi
k
points in B(x′,rk)∩Λ such that
˜fi(ai
k)≥1
|B(x′,rk)|ˆ
B(x′,rk)∩Λfi(x)dx−2−k|x′−x0|, (4.6)
˜fi(bi
k)≤1
|B(x′,rk)|ˆ
B(x′,rk)∩Λfi(x)dx+2−k|x′−x0|. (4.7)
If there is an equality in (4.6) or (4.7), we deﬁne xi

k, correspondingly.
Otherwise, by continuity of ˜fion Λ, there exist two balls B(ai
k,ρ(ai
k)) andB(bi
k,ρ(bi
k)),
contained in B(x′,rk), such that (4.6) holds for any a∈B(ai
k,ρ(ai
k))∩Λ and(4.7) holds
for anyb∈B(bi
k,ρ(bi
k))∩Λ. Without loss of generality, we may assume ai
k= (0,...,0)
andbi
k= (b1,0,...,0). Let us now consider the lines ld:= (t,d2,...,d n) connecting
B(ai
k,ρ(ai
k)) andB(bi
k,ρ(bi
k)). Since Λ is of full measure, for Ln−1-a.e.d:= (d2,...,d n)
a lineldcontains xa∈B(ai
k,ρ(ai
k))∩Λ andxb∈B(bi
k,ρ(bi
k))∩Λ, andL1(ld\Λ) = 0.
Moreover, ˜fi∈W1,n−1and hence ˜fiis absolutely continuous on Ln−1-a.e.ld. Therefore,
by the intermediate value property, there is a point ci
k∈ldsuch that

B(x′,rk)∩Λ˜fi(x)dx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤2−k|x′−x0|.DIFFERENTIABILITY OF LIMITS OF HOMEOMORPHISMS 10
Moreover, there exists xi
k∈ld∩Λ⊂B(x′,rk) such that
(4.9) |˜f(ci
k)−˜f(xi
k)| ≤2−k|x′−x0|.
Then, by (4.5), (4.8), and (4.9),
(4.10) |˜fi(xi
k)−˜fi(x′)| ≤ |˜fi(xi
k)−˜fi(ci
k)|+|˜fi(ci
k)−˜fi(x′)|<2−k+2|x′−x0|.
Further,
(4.11)
|˜fi(x′)−˜fi(x0)−Dfi(x0)(x′−x0)|
|x′−x0|
≤|˜fi(x′)−˜fi(xi
k)|+|Dfi(x0)(x′−xi
k)|
|x′−x0|+|˜fi(xi
k)−˜fi(x0)−Dfi(x0)(xi
k−x0)|
|x′−x0|.
Sincexi
k∈B(x′,rk) and (4.10) holds, the ﬁrst term in (4.11) can be estimated as
|˜fi(x′)−˜fi(xi
k)|+|Dfi(x0)(x′−xk)|
|x′−x0|≤2−k+2+2−k|Df(x0)|.
While to estimate the second term in (4.11), we note that
|xi
k−x0| ≤ |xi
k−x′|+|x′−x0| ≤(1+2−k)|x′−x0| ≤2|x′−x0| ≤s,
sincexi
k∈B(x′,rk). And hence, by (4.3), we conclude
|˜fi(xi
k)−˜fi(x0)−Dfi(x0)(xi
k−x0)|
|x′−x0|≤2|˜fi(xi
k)−˜fi(x0)−Dfi(x0)(xi
k−x0)|
|xi
k−x0|≤ε.
Summarizing the above, we obtain that for x0∈Λ and any ε >0 there exists s >0
such that for any x′∈B/parenleftbig
x0,s
2/parenrightbig
it holds
|˜fi(x′)−˜fi(x0)−Dfi(x0)(x′−x0)|
|x′−x0|≤liminf
k→∞(2−k(4+|Dfi(x0)|)+ε) =ε.
Therefore, ˜fiis diﬀerentiable inany x0∈Λ withrespect to Ωand, moreover, D˜fi(x0) =
Dfi|Λ(x0).

5.Proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.2
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Theorem 1.1 immediately follows from Lemma 3.1 and Theo-
rem 4.4. /square
Proof of Corollary 1.2. Let us ﬁrst note that following the proof of [20, Theorem 1.1]
with substituting nbyp, we obtain
ˆ
Ω′|Df−1
k|p(y)dy≤ˆ
Ω|adjDfk|p(x)
(Jfk(x))p−1dx.
Hence,E(fk)≤ F(fk) and the sequence {f−1
k}k∈Nis bounded in W1,p(Ω′,Rn) and
passing to a subsequence if needed, there exists a weak limit h. Moreover, by [8,
Lemma 2.3] and (1.1), the inequalityˆ
Ωϕ(Jf(x))dx≤C
guarantees that Jf>0 a.e. in Ω and Jh>0 a.e. in Ω′. To ﬁnish the proof, we apply
Theorem 1.1. /square
