Entanglement distillation is a key task in quantum-information processing. In this paper, we distill
non-positive-partial-transpose (NPT) bipartite states of some given Schmidt rank and matrix rank.
We show that all bipartite states of Schmidt rank two are locally equivalent to classical-classical
states, and all bipartite states of Schmidt rank three are 1-undistillable. Subsequently, we show that
low-rank B-irreducible NPT states are distillable for large-rank reduced density operators by proving
low-rank B-irreducible NPT state whose range contains a product vector is distillable. Eventually,
we present an equivalent condition to distill M×Nbipartite states of rank max {M, N}+ 1.
I. INTRODUCTION
Entanglement distillation is a core problem in quantum information theory [1]. It is the procedure of asymptotically
transforming mixed entangled states to pure entangled states through local operations and classical communication
(LOCC). An entangled state is distillable if the transformation works. Distillable entangled states are valuable resource
in performing quantum information processing tasks including dense coding [2], teleportation [3], key agreement [4, 5],
computational speedup [6] and quantum error correction [7]. In contrast, undistillable entangled states cannot be
used for quantum tasks directly [8]. Unfortunately, the quantum system interacts with the environment inevitably,
thus pure states are easily converted into mixed states. It has been shown that all positive partial transpose (PPT)
states are nondistillable [9]. A long-standing open problem is whether bipartite non-positive partial transpose (NPT)
states can be distilled [9, 10].
Recently, the distillability problem has been listed as one of the five open problems in quantum information theory
[11]. This problem is of high research value both theoretically and practically. From a mathematical point of view,
the distillability problem is deeply related to the 2-decomposable map in operator algebra, the generalized Cauchy
inequality conjecture, and Hilbert’s 17th problem [12]. Although there have been some attempts to the distillability
problem [13–16], the complete solution is unknown. The main difficulty is that it involves rapidly increasing number of
parameters in the density matrices of states in high dimensions. The general approach to the distillability problem is
starting with some simple cases to gain experience in solving the complicated cases. It has been shown that entangled
states of rank two and three [14, 17, 18], 2 ×NNPT states, M×Nentangled states of rank N(where M≤N)
[8, 17], and NPT states of rank at most four [19] are distillable. Further, the existence of PPT entangled states has
been proven [20], and the set of these states has a positive measure. The following two ways are possible to access
the distillability problem. The first way is to determine whether bipartite states of certain ranks are distillable. The
second way is to propose a more applicable index except matrix rank to determine distillability. For example, we
research the distillability of NPT states in terms of Schmidt rank. The Schmidt rank is also used in the studies of
unitary gates [21], mutually unbiased bases [22] and proving 0-entropy inequality in multipartite system [23].
In this paper we investigate the distillability of bipartite NPT states in terms of Schmidt rank and matrix rank.
We show that all Schmidt-rank-two bipartite states are equivalent to classical-classical states in Lemma 7, and all
Schmidt-rank-three bipartite states are 1-undistillable in Lemma 8. Secondly, we study the distillability of bipartite
NPT states in the space CM⊗CNof rank N+ 1. We propose a sufficient condition to the distillability in regard to
the principal submatrix of negative determinant in Lemma 9. We prove that the 1-distillability of M×NNPT states
of rank N+ 1 is equivalent to that of B-irreducibile M×NNPT states of rank N+ 1 in Lemma 10. Moreover we
show that an M×NB-irreducible NPT state of rank N+ 1 whose range contains a product vector is 1-distillable
in Theorem 11. We prove that all bipartite B-irreducible M×NNPT states of rank N+ 1 are 1-distillable when
min{M, N}>3 in Lemma 12. Further, we show that the 1-distillability of M×NNPT states of rank N+ 1 is
equivalent to that of 3 ×NNPT states of rank N+ 1.
As far as we know, it is the first time to distill NPT states in terms of Schmidt rank. The Schmidt rank of states in a
bipartite finite dimensional Hilbert space is a measure of entanglement [24]. For the distillability problem, the import

of Schmidt rank helps make full use of local equivalence of the bipartite matrix in the two spaces respectively. The
operator Schmidt rank has been found related to separability [25]; the attainable bound of Schmidt rank of bipartite
subspace has been proven by algebraic geometry techniques [24]; the distillation of pure entangled state in bipartite
system with certain Schmidt rank has been shown [26]; and the extension of Schmidt rank to infinitely dimensional
system is the monotone of SLOCC convertibility [27]. Moreover, many results for the distillability of low-matrix-rank
states were found through constructing PPT states [28]. Our results further extend the previous studies, and show
the latest progress on the distillability problem.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce distillation related knowledge and mathematical
notations in this paper. In Sec. II A we introduce facts on Schmidt rank we used in this paper, and in Sec. II B we
introduce facts on block form and irreducibility. In Sec. III we determine the distillability of Schmidt rank two and
three bipartite states respectively. In Sec. IV we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the distillability of
low-rank entangled states. In Sec. V we make a conclusion of this paper.
II. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we introduce the facts and knowledge used in this paper. First, we refer to an m×nbipartite
state ρABas an order- mblock matrix with each block of order n, such that rank ρA=mand rank ρB=n, where ρA
andρBare respectively the reduced density operators of system A and B of ρAB. For example, the k×kidentity
matrix Ikis a non-normalized state. It is also known that ρAcan be worked out by partial trace over system Bof
ρAB, i.e., ρA= Tr BρAB=Pn
j=1⟨j|BρAB|j⟩B. Next, if ρABis written as ρAB=Pm
i,j=1|i⟩⟨j| ⊗Mij, then its partial
transpose is denoted as ρΓ
AB=Pm
i,j=1|j⟩⟨i| ⊗Mij. IfρΓ
ABis not positive semidefinite, then we say that ρABis a
non-positive-partial-transpose (NPT) state. Otherwise, we say that ρABis a positive-partial-transpose (PPT) state.
For example, a typical family of PPT states is the so-called separable states defined as the convex sum of product
states. Third, we say that two bipartite states αandβare locally equivalent when there is an invertible product
matrix S=M⊗Nsuch that α=SβS†. In this case, we shall refer to α∼β. One can straightforwardly show
that, two locally equivalent states are at the same time NPT (and PPT, separable, respectively). Fourth, a bipartite
entangled state ρisn-distillable when there is a Schmidt-rank-two state |ψ⟩AB, with A=A1...AnandB=B1...Bn,
such that ⟨ψ|(ρΓ)⊗n|ψ⟩<0, and the j’th matrix ρΓacts on the bipartite space HAjBj. We say that ρis distillable
when ρisn-distillable for some n. It is not hard to see that, two locally equivalent states are at the same distillable or
not. Further, if ρis PPT then the inequality ⟨ψ|(ρΓ)⊗n|ψ⟩<0 fails. So every PPT state is not distillable. However,
whether every NPT state is distillable remains a long-standing open problem.
The following fact in Lemma 1(i) is from [9, 18, 29], the fact in Lemma 1(ii) is from [8, 17], the fact in Lemma 1(iii)
is from [17], and the fact in Lemma 1(iv) is from [8, 30, 31].
Lemma 1 (i) Every 2×nNPT state is 1-distillable.
(ii) Every m×nNPT state of rank at most max{m, n}is 1-distillable.
(iii) Every m×nstate of rank smaller than max{m, n}is NPT.
(iv) Every m×nPPT state of rank max{m, n}is separable. Further, it is the convex sum of max{m, n}pure product
states. In particular, if m≤nthen an m×nPPT state of rank ncan be written as C†Cwhere C= [C0, ..., C M−2, I]
and all Cj’s are normal matrices which are simultaneously unitarily diagonalizable.
In the rest of this section, we review the notions and facts on Schmidt rank, block form and irreducibility of a
bipartite state. They are respectively presented in Sec. II A and II B.
A. Schmidt rank
We say that two matrices AandBare orthogonal in the sense that Tr( A†B) = 0. The following fact is from [32].
Lemma 2 Suppose ρis an m×nstate. Then ρ=P
jAj⊗Bj, where Aj’s are nonzero orthogonal order- mHermitian
matrices, and Bj’s are nonzero orthogonal order- nHermitian matrices.
LetMa,b(C) denote the set of a×bmatrices. It is known that the Schmidt rank of a bipartite matrix Min the space
Ma,b(C)⊗Mc,d(C) is the minimum integer kadmitting the decomposition M=Pk
j=1Aj⊗Bjwith Aj∈Ma,b(C) and
Bj∈Mc,d(C). Ifkis exactly the Schmidt rank of Mthen the decomposition is referred to as a Schmidt decomposition
ofM, and we denote k= sr( M). It is not hard to verify that the decomposition is a Schmidt decomposition of M
if and only if Aj’s are linearly independent, and Bj’s are also linearly independent. For example, the decomposition3
in Lemma 2 is a Schmidt decomposition of ρ, and the number of matrices Aj’s in the lemma is the Schmidt rank of
ρ. For convenience, we shall refer to the space A (or B) of the bipartite matrix Mas the matrix subspace spanned
byAj’s (or Bj’s) in the Schmidt decomposition M=Pk
j=1Aj⊗Bj. Using these notions, one can straightforwardly
verify the following claim.
Lemma 3 (i) Every bipartite matrix Mhas constant space AandB. They have the same dimension.
(ii) If F1, .., F sare linearly independent matrices in the space AofM, then we can find a Schmidt decomposition
ofMsuch that M=Ps
j=1Fj⊗Bj+Psr(M)
j=s+1Aj⊗Bj.
(iii) If Mis a bipartite state and F1, .., F sare linearly independent Hermitian matrices in the space AofM, then
we can find a Schmidt decomposition of Msuch that M=Ps
j=1Fj⊗Bj+Psr(M)
j=s+1Aj⊗Bj, where all AjandBjare
Hermitian matrices.
(iv) If Mis a bipartite state then the reduced density operator of system Ais in the space AofM.
The following result relatd to Schmidt rank is from [24].
Lemma 4 (i) The maximum dimension of a subspace S ⊆ H A⊗HB=CM⊗CNis given by (M−k+ 1)( N−k+ 1),
when sr(|v⟩)≥kfor all nonzero |v⟩ ∈ S .
(ii) If a subspace V ⊆ H A⊗ HB=CM⊗CNhas dimension DimV(M−1)(N−1) + 1 , then Vcontains infinitely
many product vectors.
It can be deduced that if Uis a subspace of HA⊗ HB=CM⊗CNand Dim U>(M−k+ 1)( N−k+ 1), then there
exists |u⟩ ∈ U , such that sr( |u⟩)< k. For example, the lemma says that every M×Nsubspace of dimension at least
(M−1)(N−1) + 1 has a product vector. Further, every M×Nsubspace of dimension at least ( M−2)(N−2) + 1
has a bipartite vector of Schmidt rank two.
We shall apply the facts of this subsection in Sec. III.
B. block form and irreducible state
We will denote by {|i⟩A:i= 0, . . . , M −1}and{|j⟩B:j= 0, . . . , N −1}as the orthonormal bases of HAand
HB, respectively. Let H=HA⊗ H B. The subscripts A and B will be often omitted. Any state ρof rank rcan be
represented as
ρ=M−1X
i,j=0|i⟩⟨j| ⊗C†
iCj, (1)
where the CiareR×Nmatrices and Ris an arbitrary integer ≥r. In particular, one can take R=r. We shall often
consider ρas a block matrix ρ=C†C= [C†
iCj], where C= [C0C1···CM−1] is an R×MN matrix. Thus C†
iCjis
the matrix of the linear operator ⟨i|Aρ|j⟩Aacting on HB. For the reduced density matrices, we have the formulae
ρB=M−1X
i=0C†
iCi;ρA= [Tr C†
iCj], i, j = 0, . . . , M −1. (2)
One can verify that the range of ρis the space spanned by the column vectors of the matrix C†and that
kerρ=(M−1X
i=0|i⟩ ⊗ |yi⟩:M−1X
i=0Ci|yi⟩= 0)
. (3)
In particular, if Ci|j⟩= 0 for some iandjthen|i, j⟩ ∈kerρ.
Next we introduce the concept of irreducibility for bipartite states.
Definition 5 We say that a linear operator ρ:H → H is an A-direct sum of linear operators ρ1:H → H and
ρ2:H → H , and we write ρ=ρ1⊕Aρ2, ifR(ρA) =R((ρ1)A)⊕ R((ρ2)A). A bipartite state ρisA-reducible if it is
an A-direct sum of two states; otherwise ρisA-irreducible . One defines similarly the B-direct sum ρ=ρ1⊕Bρ2, the
B-reducible and the B-irreducible states. We say that a state ρisreducible if it is either A or B-reducible. We say
thatρisirreducible if it is not reducible. We write ρ=ρ1⊕ρ2ifρ=ρ1⊕Aρ2andρ=ρ1⊕Bρ2, and in that case
we say that ρis adirect sum ofρ1andρ2.4
The following fact is from [8].
Lemma 6 Letρbe an B-irreducible M×Nstate such that H′
A⊗ |b⟩ ⊆kerρfor an (M−1)-dimensional subspace
H′
A⊆ H Aand some state |b⟩ ∈ H B. Then ρis 1-distillable.
We shall apply the facts of this subsection in Sec. IV.
III. DISTILLABILITY IN TERMS OF SCHMIDT RANK
We recall that the classical-classical state is a separable state having no quantum correlation. That is, the state
has zero quantum discord [33] and is mathematically a diagonal state. The first assertion of the following lemma has
been proven in [34]. We give a novel proof for the other claims of lemma.
Lemma 7 Every bipartite state of Schmidt rank two is separable, and thus cannot be distillable. Besides, the state is
locally equivalent to a classical-classical state.
Proof. Suppose ρABis a bipartite state of Schmidt rank two on the bipartite space HAB. Lemma 2 says that, ρAB
can be written as
ρAB=A1⊗B1+A2⊗B2, (4)
where AjandBjare all Hermitian matrices. By tracing out system B, we obtain that ρA=A1(TrB1) +A2(TrB2).
Because ρAis an invertible matrix, one of the two real numbers Tr B1and Tr B2is nonzero. Without loss of generality,
we may assume that Tr B1̸= 0. Hence A1is the real linear combination of ρAandA2. Applying the combination
to (4), we obtain that ρAB=ρA⊗B′
1+A2⊗B′
2. Because ρAis invertible, we can find an invertible matrix Ssuch
thatSρAS†is the identity matrix, and SA2S†is a real diagonal matrix. Applying the above argument to B1andB2
in (4), we can find an invertible matrix Wsuch that WρBW†is the identity matrix, and WB 2W†is a real diagonal
matrix. As a result, the state ( S⊗W)ρAB(S†⊗W†) is diagonal, which is a classical-classical state having no quantum
correlation. Because the separability is invariant under local equivalence, we know that ρABis also separable, and
thus cannot be distillable. ⊓ ⊔
Next, we proceed with bipartite states of Schmidt rank three. It turns out that such states are 1-undistillable or
undistillable.
Theorem 8 (i) If the space A of a bipartite state of Schmidt rank three has an Hermitian matrix of rank one, then
the state is PPT and not distillable.
(ii) For every min{m, n}>2, every m×nNPT state of Schmidt rank three is 1-undistillable.
(iii) Every 2×nstate of Schmidt rank three is separable.
Proof. (i) Suppose ρABis a bipartite state of Schmidt rank three on the bipartite space HAB=Cm⊗Cn. Using
Lemmas 3 (iii), we can assume that
ρAB=A1⊗B1+A2⊗B2+A3⊗B3, (5)
where AjandBjare all Hermitian matrices, A1=ρAand rank A2= 1. Up to the local equivalence, we can assume
that A1=ImandA2= 1⊕0m−1. Because A3is Hermitian, one can find a unitary gate U= 1⊕Vsuch that
UA3U†is a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix. Hence, the partial transpose of ( U⊗I)ρAB(U†⊗I) is still positive
semidefinite. So ρABis PPT and not distillable.
(ii) For every bipartite state ρABof Schmidt rank three, we can still apply (5), in which A1=Im, and A2, A3are
both Hermitian matrices.
We disprove the assertion. Suppose for some min {m, n}>2, there is an m×nNPT state ρABof Schmidt rank
three is 1-distillable. Hence, there is a rank-two matrix Msuch that the projected state σAB= (M⊗I)ρAB(M†⊗I)
is entangled and NPT. Let Ube an order- minvertible matrix such that the nonzero entries of UM are all in the top
two rows of UM. So we can refer UM to the first two rows of it and assume that σABis a 2×2 block matrix of each
block of order n. It follows from (5) that σAB=P3
j=1A′
j⊗Bj, where A′
j’s are all 2 ×2 Hermitian matrices, and
A′
1is invertible. So we can find a 2 ×2 invertible matrix Ssuch that SA′
jS†’s are all real symmetric matrices. As a
result, the state ( S⊗I)σAB(S†⊗I) is a 2 ×nPPT state. It is a contradiction with the fact that σABis NPT. We
have proven the assertion.
(iii) It follows from the proof of (ii) that every 2 ×nstate ρABof Schmidt rank three is PPT. In particular, up to
a local equivalence we have ρΓ
AB=ρAB. It has been proven that such ρABis separable [35]. ⊓ ⊔5
So far we have investigated the distillability of NPT states in terms of Schmidt rank two and three. Nevertheless,
we have found that it is not easy to apply the existing results to NPT states of Schmidt rank four. To further distill
more entangled states, we shall investigate their rank in the next section. Such states may have various Schmidt rank,
as we will in see in the next section.
IV. DISTILLABILITY IN TERMS OF MATRIX RANK
In this section, we distill some types of bipartite NPT states in terms of rank. In Lemma 9, we provide a sufficient
condition to determine the distillability which paves the way for proving Lemma 11. Next, in Lemma 10, we show
that the 1-distillablility of all bipartite NPT states is equivalent to that of all B-irreducible bipartite NPT states.
Further, the 1-distillability of all M×NNPT states of rank max {M, N}+ 1 is equivalent to that of all B-irreducible
M×NNPT states of rank max {M, N}+ 1. Lemma 11 and Theorem 12 are crucial work in this section. Lemma 11
shows the relation between the distillability and range of bipartite states containing a product vector. This lays the
foundation to show that all M×NB-irreducible NPT states of rank N+ 1 are distillable in Theorem 12. Eventually,
we derive that the 1-distillability of every M×NNPT state of rank max {M, N}+ 1 is equivalent to that of every
3×NB-irreducible NPT state of rank max {M, N}+ 1 in Lemma 13.
The following observation extends Lemma 2 of [19].
Lemma 9 Letρbe a bipartite state such that ρΓhas a principal k×ksubmatrix of negative determinant. If the
diagonal elements of the submatrix are from two blocks of ρ=P
i,j|i⟩⟨j| ⊗σij, then ρis distillable.
Proof. Letρ=P
i,j|i⟩⟨j| ⊗σij, then ρΓ=P
i,j|j⟩⟨i| ⊗σij. Denote the submatrix as [ sij]. From σii≥0 we
know that the diagonal entries of [ sij] belong to different blocks, say σll, σmm. Let P be the orthogonal projector
onto the 2-dimensional subspace of HAspanned by {|l⟩,|m⟩}, that is P=|l⟩⟨l|+|m⟩⟨m|. Then the projected state
(P⊗I)ρ(P†⊗I) has a principal k×ksubmatrix of negative determinant, thus it is an 2 ×nNPT state. Using Lemma
1, we obtain that ρis distillable. ⊓ ⊔
As an application of Definition 5, we present the following observation.
Lemma 10 (i) All bipartite NPT states are 1-distillable if and only if all B-irreducible bipartite NPT states are
1-distillable.
(ii) Let M≤N. All M×NNPT states of rank N+ 1are 1-distillable if and only if all B-irreducible M×NNPT
states of rank N+ 1are 1-distillable.
Proof. (i) It suffices to prove the ”if” part. We assume that all B-irreducible bipartite NPT states are 1-distillable.
We take an arbitrary B-reducible bipartite NPT state ρwhich can be decomposed into ρ=ρ1⊕Bρ2. Ifρ1orρ2is
still B-reducible, we continue to decompose it into the B-direct sum of two linear operaters, until ρ= (⊕i)Bρiwhere
ρi’s are B-irreducible. Since ρis an NPT state, for some jwe have that ρjis an NPT state. We can take a projector
to transform ρtoρj, from our hypothesis ρjis 1-distillable and thus ρis 1-distillable.
(ii) It still suffices to prove the ”if” part. We assume that all B-irreducible M×NNPT states of rank N+ 1 are
1-distillable. For an arbitrary M×NNPT state ρof rank N+1, we decompose it into the sum of B-irreducible states
ρ= (⊕i)Bρi. If there exists some mj×njstate ρjsuch that rank( ρj)< nj, by Lemma 1(iii) ρjis an NPT state. We
can transform ρtoρj, and by Lemma 1(ii) we know that ρis 1-distillable. Otherwise, for any i,ρiis an mi×nistate
with rank( ρi)≥ni. Since
R(ρk)⊆ R((ρk)A)⊗ R((ρk)B) (6)
and
R(ρl)⊆ R((ρl)A)⊗ R((ρl)B) (7)
for any k̸=l, where R((ρk)B)∩ R((ρl)B) ={0}. Then rank( ρ) =P
irank( ρi). In terms of rank(( ρi)B) =ni≤
rank( ρi), we find that
N= rank( ρB) =X
irank(( ρi)B)≤X
irank( ρi) = rank( ρ) =N+ 1. (8)
Therefore, for any ieither
rank(( ρi)B) = rank( ρi) (9)6
or
rank(( ρi)B) + 1 = rank( ρi) (10)
stands. Because ρis an NPT state, we obtain that ρjis an NPT state for some j. If (9) stands, ρjis an mj×nj
NPT state with rank nj, by Lemma 1(ii) ρjis 1-distillable. If (10) stands, ρjis an mj×njNPT state with rank
nj+ 1, when mj> njby Lemma 1(ii) ρjis 1-distillable; when mj≤njby the hypothesis ρjis 1-distillable. Under a
projector P, (I⊗P†)ρ(I⊗P) =ρj, soρis 1-distillable. ⊓ ⊔
In the following, we investigate a special case of distilling B-irreducible NPT states.
Lemma 11 Ifρis an M×NB-irreducible NPT state of rank N+ 1such that the range of ρcontains at least one
product vector, then ρis 1-distillable.
Proof. By using Eq. (1), we have ρ=C†Cwhere C= [C0C1···CM−1] and the blocks Ci’s are ( N+ 1)×N
matrices. The blocks are linearly independent because rank ρA=M.
We disprove the assertion. Assume that some ρis not 1-distillable. Using Lemma 1, we have 2 < M≤N. Since
R(ρ) contains at least one product vector, we may assume that the first row of Ciis 0 for i >0. For the state
σ:= [C1···CM−1]†[C1···CM−1], we have rank σ≤NandσB=P
i>0C†
iCi. IfσB|b⟩= 0 for some |b⟩ ̸= 0, then
Ci|b⟩= 0 for i >0 and so |0⟩⊥⊗ |b⟩ ⊆kerρ. So ρis 1-distillable by Lemma 6, which is a contradiction with the
assumption. Thus we may assume that rank σB=N. Next Lemma 1 (iii) implies that rank σ=N. Lemma 1 (iv)
implies that σis PPT, and σis the convex sum of exactly Npure product states.
By dropping the first row of Ci, we obtain the N×Nmatrix C′
i,i= 0,1, . . . , M −1. Up to the local equivalence
I⊗Vfor some invertible V, we may assume that C′
1=IN,
C′
i=λi1Il1⊕ ··· ⊕ λikIlk, i > 0;l1+···+lk=N, (11)
and that whenever r̸=sthere exists an i >1 such that λir̸=λis. (Note that all λ1r= 1.) Since the Ciare linearly
independent, each set {λir:r= 1, . . . , k },i >1, must have at least two elements, namely k >1. Let C′
0= [Aij]k
i,j=1
be the partition with the Aiisquare of order li. If some Ars̸= 0, r̸=s, then ρis 1-distillable by Lemma 9 and
projecting ρ→P†ρPwhere P= (|0⟩(⟨0|+x⟨1|) +|j⟩⟨1|)⊗Ifor some xandj >0. It is a contradiction with the
assumption. Hence, we may assume that C′
0=B1⊕ ··· ⊕ Bkwith Bi=Aiisquare of order liand upper triangular.
Suppose the first row of C0consists of the vectors w1, . . . , w kof lengths l1, . . . , l k, respectively. Let µiandνibe
the first entries of wiandBi, respectively. If some µiis 0, say µ1= 0, then by subtracting from Ci,i̸= 1, a suitable
scalar multiple of C1, we may assume that the first columns of the Ci,i̸= 1, are 0. Since ρis B-irreducible, the
second row of C0is not zero. It follows that the state [ C0C1]†[C0C1] is 1-distillable by Lemma 6, and so is ρ. It is a
contradiction with the assumption. Thus, we may assume that all µi̸= 0.
Because ρis NPT, at least one block of Bj’s, say B1is not a diagonal matrix. We can find one block of Cj’s with
j >1, say C2satisfying λ21̸=λ2k. Now the projected state K†Kwhere K= [C0−νkC1, C2−λ2kC1] has to be PPT.
We can further project the state K†Konto L†Lwhere L= [B1−νkIl1,(λ21−λ2k)Il1]. Note that this is a 2 ×l1PPT
state of rank l1. Using Lemma 1 (iii), we know that B1−νkIl1is normal and thus the upper triangular matrix B1
is diagonal. It is a contradiction with the fact that B1is not diagonal. So the assumption that ρis not 1-distillable
fails, and we have completed the proof. ⊓ ⊔
Now we are in a position to present the main result of this section.
Theorem 12 (M, N > 3)Ifρis an M×NB-irreducible NPT state of rank N+ 1, then ρis 1-distillable.
Proof. We disprove the claim. Assume that some ρis not 1-distillable. By using Lemma 11, we may assume that
the range of ρhas no product vector. By Lemma 1 (ii), we may assume that M≤N. For any |a⟩ ∈ H Aletrabe
the rank of the linear operator ⟨a|ρ|a⟩. Since M > 3, we have Dim ker ρ=MN−N−1>(M−1)(N−1) + 1. So
by Lemma 4 (ii) ker ρcontains infinitely many product vectors. If |a, b⟩ ∈kerρis a product vector then ⟨a|ρ|a⟩kills
the vector |b⟩, and so ra< N. Let Rbe the maximum of rataken over all |a⟩ ∈ H Asuch that ra< N. Thus R < N .
Without any loss of generality we may assume that ⟨0|Aρ|0⟩Ahas rank R.
We write ρas in Eq. (1), i.e., ρ=C†Cwhere C= [C0···CM−1] and the blocks Ciare (N+ 1)×Nmatrices. As
C†
0C0=⟨0|Aρ|0⟩A, rank C0=Rand we may assume that

= 0. It implies that ρBis singular, which is a contradiction
with the fact that ρB>0. So σB>0, and rank σB=N−R. Next, the assumption that ρis not 1-distillable
implies that rank σ≥rankσB=N−Rby Lemma 1. Recall that the blocks Ciare (N+ 1)×Nmatrices, and thus
rankσ= rank C′≤N−R+ 1. We have two cases namely (i) rank σ=N−R, and (ii) rank σ=N−R+ 1.
(i) Suppose rank σ=N−R. Because ρis not 1-distillable and rank σB=N−R, we see that σis PPT state by
Lemma 1 (ii). And Lemma 1 (iv) shows that σis the convex sum of exactly N−Rpure product states. Up to local
equivalence, we may assume that every Ci3is diagonal with the last zero row for i >0. By the same reason, we may
assume that the first entry of C13is nonzero and that of Ci3fori >1 is zero. Hence |1⟩⊥⊗ |R⟩ ⊆kerρ. So ρis
1-distillable by Lemma 6. It is a contradiction with the assumption, and we have completed the proof in case (i).
(ii) Suppose rank σ=N−R+ 1. The fact rank σB=N−Rand Eq. (13) imply that
1< m := rank σA< M. (14)
Up to local equivalence, we may assume that the blocks Ci3= 0 for i > m , and the blocks C13, ..., C m3are linearly
independent. If a nontrivial linear combination of the blocks C13, ..., C m3is of rank r1< N−R, then there is a vector
|a′⟩ ∈ H Asuch that ⟨a′|ρ|a′⟩has rank R+r1∈(R, N ). It is a contradiction with the definition of R, namely Ris the
maximum of rA= rank ⟨a|ρ|a⟩taken over all |a⟩ ∈ H Asuch that ra< N. Hence, any nontrivial linear combination
of the blocks C13, ..., C m3is of full rank N−R. Using Eq.(13), we obtain that σis an m×(N−R) state of rank
N−R+ 1, and the kernel of σhas no product vector. It occurs only if m= 2 due to (14) and Lemma 4. Hence
Ci3= 0 for i >2. Because ρis not 1-distillable, we have C†
i2C13=C†
i2C23= 0. Hence, Ci2= 0 for i >2.
For convenience, we summary so far the facts over ρ, i.e.,
ρ= [C0, C1, ..., C M−1]†[C0, C1, ..., C M−1], (15)

where the blocks Ci0areR×Rmatrices, rank[ C13C23] =N−R+1, the blocks C13andC23are linearly independent
(N−R+ 1)×(N−R) blocks, any nontrivial linear combination of C13andC23is of full rank N−R.
We can project the state ρin (15) onto ρ1= [IR, C30, ..., C M−1,0]†[IR, C30, ..., C M−1,0]. One may verify that ρ1and
(ρ1)Bboth rank R. Because ρis not 1-distillable, Lemma 1 shows that ρ1is PPT and the convex sum of exactly
Rpure product states. Up to local equivalence, we may assume that every R×Rmatrix Ci0in (16) for i >2 is
diagonal. By simultaneously permuting their diagonal entries (if necessary) we may assume that
Ci0=λi1Il1⊕ ··· ⊕ λikIlk, i > 2;l1+···+lk=R, (17)
and that whenever r̸=sthere exists an isuch that λir̸=λis. Recall that rank ρA=M > 3, we have k >1. Using
Lemma 9 one can show that the matrices C10andC20are direct sums
C10=E1⊕ ··· ⊕ Ek, C 20=F1⊕ ··· ⊕ Fk, (18)

where Ci22andCi32are row-vectors. By multiplying [ C0, C1, ..., C M−1] of (15) on the left hand side by a unitary
matrix IR⊕U, we may assume that C132= 0. Recall that rank C13=N−Rbelow (16). So the square matrix C131
is invertible, and we may assume that C121= 0 up to local equivalence. We split the row-vector C122intokpieces8

Recall that the hypothesis says that R(ρ) has no product vector. Eq. (15) implies that in (20), each li>1 and at
least one wi̸= 0. As we can simultaneously permute the first kdiagonal blocks of the matrices Cj, we may assume
thatw1̸= 0. Let w1= (a1, . . . , a n,0, . . . , 0) where aj̸= 0 and let us partition

where E10is of size n×n. Recal the asumption below (18), E1is a lower triangular matrix, thus E11= 0. By the
same reason and by using Lemma 1 (iv), we may assume that the state [ Il1−nE13]†[Il1−nE13] is PPT and so the
matrix E13must be normal. Since E13is also lower triangular below (18), it must be a diagonal matrix.
By adding a suitable multiple of C0onC1ofρ, we may assume that E13is invertible. By adding suitable multiples
of columns n+ 1, ..., l 1ofC1on columns 1 , ..., n ofC1, we can assume that E12= 0 (Note that such local equivalence
also changes F1, C22, λj1Il1for every j >2). We conclude that except for anand the last entry of E10all other entries
of the nth column of C1are 0. By subtracting from C1a scalar multiple of C0, we may assume that the last entry of
E10is 0. Now anis the only nonzero entry in the nth column of C1.
We can choose an index i >2 such that λi1̸=λik. By replacing Ciwith Ci−λi1C0using local equivalence, the
nth column of Cibecomes 0. By Lemma 1 (iv), we may assume that the state [ Ek,(λik−λi1)Ilk]†[Ek,(λik−λi1)Ilk]
of rank lkis PPT. Since its B-local rank is also lk, the matrix Ekmust be normal. As it is also lower triangular, it
must be a diagonal matrix. Because ρis not 1-distillable, using Lemma 9 we can further assume that
Ek=µ1In1⊕ ··· ⊕ µsIns, F k=Gn1⊕ ··· ⊕ Gns;n1+···+ns=lk, (22)
with Gjupper triangular of order njfor each j,µi̸=µjands≥1. Then the Rth row of Cis a product vector,
which shows that R(ρ) contains a product vector. This is a contradiction with the hypothesis, and the proof is
completed. ⊓ ⊔
Unfortunately, we are not able to distill the 3 ×NB-irreducible NPT state of rank N+ 1. If this case was proven,
then Lemma 10 and Theorem 12 would show that every M×NNPT state of rank N+ 1 is 1-distillable. Formally,
we state it as follows.
Lemma 13 Every M×NNPT state of rank N+ 1is 1-distillable, if and only if every 3×NB-irreducible NPT
state of rank N+ 1is 1-distillable.
Proof. It suffices to prove the ”if” part. We assume that every 3 ×NB-irreducible NPT state of rank N+ 1
is 1-distillable. Combined with Theorem 12 we know that every M×NB-irreducible NPT state of rank N+ 1 is
1-distillable. Using Lemma 10(ii), we obtain every M×NNPT state of rank N+ 1 is 1-distillable. ⊓ ⊔
V. CONCLUSION
We have shown that a bipartite NPT state of Schmidt three is 1-undistillable under LOCC. The distillablility of
bipartite NPT states of Schmidt rank at least four remains an open problem. We also have shown that an M×N
B-irreducible NPT state of rank max {M, N}+ 1 is 1-distillable when M, N > 3. An open problem from this paper
is to distill 3 ×NB-irreducible NPT states of rank N+ 1 or larger rank. The first case is N= 4, because every
rank-four NPT state is known to be 1-distillable. A possible approach for the problems is to consider its irreducibility
and product states in its range and kernel.9
