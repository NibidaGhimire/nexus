  Abstract  
Intracranial EEG (iEEG) is the gold standard technique for epileptogenic zone (EZ) localisation,  but 
requires a preconceived hypothesis of the location of the epileptogenic tissue. This placement is guided by 
qualitative interpretations of seizure semiology, MRI, EEG and other imaging modalities, such as 
magnetoencephalography (MEG). Q uantitative abnormality mapping using MEG has recently been shown 
to have potential clinical value. We hypothesised that if quantifiable MEG abnormalities were sampled by 
iEEG, then patients‚Äô post -resection seizure outcome may be better.  
Thirty -two individ uals with refractory neocortical epilepsy underwent MEG and subsequent iEEG 
recordings as part of pre -surgical evaluation. Eyes-closed resting -state interictal MEG band power 
abnormality maps were derived from 70  healthy controls as a normative baseline. MEG abnormality maps 
were compared to iEEG electrode implantation, with the spatial overlap of iEEG  electrode placement and 
cerebral MEG abnormalities recorded. Finally, we assessed if the implantation of electrodes in abnormal tissue, and subsequent resection of the strongest abnormalities determined by MEG and iEEG corresponded to surgical success.  
Intracranial electrodes were implanted in brain tissue with the most abnormal  MEG findings  - in individuals 
that were seizure-free post -operatively (T=3.9, p=0.003), but not in those who did not become seizure free. 
The overlap between MEG abnormalities and electrode placement distinguished surgical outcome groups 
moderately well (AUC=0.68). In isolation, the resection of the strongest abnormalities as defined by  MEG 
and iEEG separated surgical outcome groups well, AUC=0.71, AUC=0.74 respectively. A model 
incorporating all three features separated surgical outcome groups best (AUC=0.80).  
Intracranial EEG is a key tool to delineate the EZ and help render individuals seizure-free post-operatively. 
We showed that data-driven abnormality maps derived from resting-state MEG recordings demonstrate 
clinical value and may help guide electrode placement in individuals with neocortical epilepsy. Additionally, our predictive model of post -operative seizure-fre edom, which leverages both MEG and 
iEEG recordings, could aid patient counselling of expected outcome.  
  Introduction  
Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings are widely considered as the gold -standard technique to accurately 
localise the epileptogenic zone (EZ - the part of the brain indispensable for seizures). Multiple markers of 
the EZ have been developed from interictal spikes1‚Äì4 and high frequency oscillations5‚Äì12, to the ictal onset 
patterns themselves13. Successful  iEEG implantation requires a preconceived hypotheses of the location of 
epileptogenic tissue. Thus, if the EZ is not implanted one may expect poorer post -surgical outcomes.  
The planning of  iEEG electrodes depends on seizure semiology, MRI, scalp EEG, and MEG. 
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings may aid electrode implantation; however, most analyses 
largely remain qualitative and mainly investigating spikes14‚Äì19. Band power abnormality maps from 
interictal MEG data recently quantified epileptogenic tissue in individuals with refractory neocor tical 
epilepsy using a data-driven framework, and demonstrated localisation overlap with subsequent resection only in seizure -free patients
20. With complete cortical coverage, and sensitivity to abnormalities, MEG band 
power abnormality maps may be of use to localise the EZ and guide intracranial electrode placement.  
Although both modalities capture neurophysiological activity, iEEG and MEG are differentially sensitive to sources of activity, and thus provide complementary information. As pyramidal cells ar e organised 
perpendicular to the cortex, iEEG typically reflects extracellular sources whilst MEG reflects intracellular sources
21. As such, iEEG and MEG are more sensitive to sources located at the crowns of gyri, and sulci 
and fissures respectively, depending on placement22. It is possible that multimodal abnormality mapping 
may provide a more complete view of the epileptogenic zone and thus further aid clinical decision making.  
In this study we performed a multimodal analysis to investigate two primary hypotheses. First, we quantified if intracranial electrodes were implanted in regions of high MEG abnormality, and hypothesised a greater overlap in patients who were seizure-free after resection. Second, we hypothesised that if 
electrodes were implanted in regions of high abnormality, then seizure -freedom would be expected if the 
greatest abnormalities in both modalities were also resected.  
  Methods  
Patient and control data 
We retrospectively analysed data from 32  individuals with refractory neocortical epilepsy who underwent 
resective surgery. Surgical success was defined using the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 
scoring23 one year post -operatively. Twelve individuals  were entirely seizure-free after surgical intervention 
(ILAE 1). No significant differences were present between surgical outcome groups based on age, sex and epilepsy duration (Table 1). All individuals underwent pre -operative MEG and then subsequent int racranial 
EEG recordings as part of their pre-surgical evaluation. Additionally, T1 -weighted MRI scans were 
acquired for each individual both pre and post -operatively. For normative baselines, 70 healthy controls 
underwent eyes -closed resting -state MEG recordings in Cardiff
24 and 234 individuals underwent invasive 
intracranical recording as part of the RAM dataset.  
Table 1: Summary of clinical demographics by surgical outcome groups.  The Mean and standard 
deviations are reported, Mean( SD), for seizure-free (ILAE 1) and non seizure-free (ILAE 2+) individuals. 
Statistical tests were performed to assess whether any differences exist between the groups. For 
continuous variables, two -tailed t-tests were used. For categorical features, two -tailed Chi-squared tests 
were used.

MRI preprocessing  
Pre and post -operative MRI scans were acquired for each subject with refractory epilepsy  and were used to 
delineate their resections. In short, MRI scans were acquired using a 3T GE Signa HDx scanner using 
standard imaging gradients, a maximum strength of 40mT ùëöùëö‚àí1 and slew rate of 150T ùëöùëö‚àí1ùë†ùë†‚àí1. Data were 
acquired using a body coil for transmission, and an 8 channel  phased array coil for reception. Standard 
clinical sequences were performed including a coronal T1 -weighted volumetric acquisition with 170 
contiguous 1.1 mm -thick slices (matrix, 256 √ó 256; inplane resolution, 0.9375 √ó 0.9375 mm). Individual 
MRI scans were preprocessed using Freesurfer‚Äôs pipeline ‚Äòrecon -all‚Äô25 and subsequently parcellated into 
114 neocortical regions of interest (ROI) based on the Lausanne parcellation scheme26. To delineate the 
resection cavity, pre- and post -operative MRI scans were linearly co -registered using FSL and overlaid27‚Äì
29. Resection volumes were manually drawn for each individual using FSLview and pre and post -operative 
volumes were estimated using custom MATLAB code30. A region was defined as resected if the pre- and post-operative volume change exceeded 10%. Regions with a volume change less than 1% were defined as 
spared, with remaining regions (volume change 1-10%) excluded from the analysis. Healthy individuals at 
Cardiff also underwent T1 -weighed MRI acquisition using a 3T GE Signa HDx scanner. A full description 
of the acquisition protocol has been described previously24. 
MEG processing and abnormality mapping  
MEG recordings for patients and healthy control cohorts were acquired using a 275 channel CTF whole 
head MEG system at different sites. Resting -state eyes-closed interictal recordings for subjects with 
epilepsy were acquired at UCL in London, and for healthy control data at CUBRIC Cardiff as part of the 
MEG UK partnership. MEG recordings from both cohorts were processed in Brainstorm using previously described methods
20. MEG sensor locations were co -registered to the individuals‚Äô MRI scan using fiducial 
points. Following co -registration, MEG recordings were downsampled to 600Hz and cleaned of any 
arifacts. Powerline artifacts were removed between 47.5 -52.5Hz using a notch filter, and ocular and cardiac 
artifacts were removed manually using independent component analysis (ICA). Once cleaned of any arifactual noise, MEG recordings were source reconstructed using the minimum- norm imagaing technique, 
sLORETA
31, and an overlapping spheres headmodel. Subsequent source space time -series were 
downsampled into cortical regions of interest (ROIs) using the Lausanne parcellation scheme26. Finally, 70 
second epochs of recordings clear of residual artifacts for each individual were used to construct neocrotical maps of band power abnormalities.  
To construct normative maps, regional power spectral densities were computed using Welch‚Äôs method 
using a two second sliding window with one second overlap. Regional relative band power estimates for 
delta (1 -4Hz), theta (4 -8Hz), alpha (8 -13Hz), beta (13 -30Hz), and gamma (30-80Hz, excluding 47.5-
52.5Hz) were averaged across all seventy healthy controls (Figure 1B). Individual band power abnormality 
maps were derived for each region by computing the absolute z -score relative to normative baselines for 
each of the five frequency bands. To reduce the dimensionality of the data we retain the maximum regional 
absolute  z-score across frequency bands (Figure 1 D). 
iEEG processing and abnormality mapping  
Long-term iEEG recordings were acquired for each individual prior to resective surgery. A cohort of 234 
subjects acquired as part of the RAM dataset were used to construct the normative map, using contact 
recordings from outside of the seizure onset and propagation zone. Seventy second epochs of resting-state wakeful recordings were chosen for each individual. Similar to MEG (Secti on 2.3), relative band power 
contributions for each contact were computed for delta (1-4Hz), theta (4 -8Hz), alpha (8 -13Hz), beta (13 -30Hz), and gamma (30-80Hz excluding 47.5-52.5Hz and 57.5- 62.5Hz). Note that artifacts were r emoved 
to account for interference from both US and UK powerlines (Figure 1 C). 
Intracranial electrodes were localised to ROIs using standard  procedure s 32. In short, electrodes used to 
construct the normative map were converted from the Talairach coordinate system to standard MNI space 
and assigned to an ROI in the Lausanne parcellation based on the minimum euclidean distance. For the patient cohort, electrode assignment was performed in native space using pre-oper ative CT and MRI 
scans
33. Similar to MEG, electrodes were considered resected if the pre and post -operative volume change 
of the region exceeded 10%.  
Overlap between MEG abnormalities and electrode placement  
We hypotheised that intracranial electrodes were implanted in regions with the greatest  MEG abnormality 
in individuals who were seizure-free post -operatively. To quantify the degree of overlap between MEG 
abnormalities and intracranial electrode placement we used the ab normality coverage. Similar to the ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ33, 
the abnormality coverage quantifies the degree in which electrodes are placed in tissue of strongest MEG abnormality using the area under the receiver -operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Ranging 
between zero and one, an abnormality coverage of 1 corresponds to electrodes implanted exclusively in the 
most abnormal neocortical tissue. Conversely, an abnormality coverage of 0 corresponds to the electrode implantation targeting the least abnormal neocortical tissue. An abnormality coverage of 0.5 corresponds 
to chance and reflects the targeting of both abnormal and seemingly healthy tissue (Figure 1 E). 
Overlap between neurophysiological abnormalities and resection mas ks 
To assess whether the locations with greatest  abnormalities were resected we used the ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ20,32. Like the 
abnormality coverage, the ùê∑ùê∑ ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ ranges from zero to one, with values of zero corresponding to the resection 
of the most abnormal tissue. The ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ was computed for each individual using MEG and iEEG data 
separately using only tissue where there was MEG and electrode coverage i.e. discarding neocortical tissue in MEG where electrodes were not implanted (Figure 1 F). 
Modelling of post -operative seizure freedom  
We investigated the extent to which the abnormality coverage and two ùê∑ùê∑ ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ measures explain surgical 
outcome using a logistic regression model. No standardisation in the form of mean centring and sca ling 
was performed prior to model fitting as all three features have natural interpretations and similar values ranges. Class weights were introduced to the model in order to account for the imbalance in surgical 
outcome groups (12 ILAE 1 and 20 ILAE 2+). Setting a class weight of 
20
32 and 1232 for seizure-free and non-seizure-free groups respectively penalises the most frequent surgical outcome group (ILAE 2+) in such a 
way that both groups are treated equally. We report the output of the model using a nom ogram (Figure 1G). 
In the context of epilepsy nomograms have previously been proposed to aid clinicians determine post -
surgical seizure-freedom34,35 and cognitive decline36,37. Nomograms are commonly used as a visual 
representation of the Cox proportional hazard model used in survival analysis; however, they can also be used for a logistic regression model. For a given subject, each feature within the nomogram accrues points towards a final score. The number of poi nts attributed to each feature is directly proportional to the feature 
importance estimated from the logistic regression model. Once all of the points for a given subject are totalled, a prediction of surgical outcome can be made based on whether the patient exceeds a given threshold determined during model training. For the nomogram presented in this study, the more points a subject accrues, the greater the confiden ce that they will be seizure- free post -operatively.  
To assess the robustness of the predictive model to outliers in the data we used leave one out validation. 
During leave one out validation, a single subject is removed from the dataset, the model is recomputed, and the AUC estimated. Once complete, the AUC scores are then averaged to obtain a robust measure of the separability of surgical outcome groups.  
Statistical testing  
Statistical tests were used to assess whether the abnormality coverage and ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ scores differ significantly 
from chance. We used a one-tailed t-test to check whether  the abnormality coverage of seizure- free patients 
was significantly greater than 0.5. A one-tailed Mann -Whitney U test was used to quantify whether our 
measures significantly separated surgical outcome groups. One-tailed tests were used as clear hypothese s 
of direction are provided.

iEEG implantation. (A -C) MEG and iEEG recordings were collected for healthy and patient cohorts. 
Recordings for 70 healthy controls and 234 individuals with epilepsy were used as a normative baselines 
for MEG and iEEG respectively. MEG and iEEG recordings were collected for an independent cohort of 
32 individuals with refractory neocortical epilepsy. Regional relative band power was averaged across 
individuals and frequency bands to create normative maps. Patient maps of band power were derived using 
normative data as baselines by retaining the maximum absolute z -score across frequencies within each 
region (D). The overlap between the strongest MEG abnormalities and electrode placement was quantified, 
defined as the abnormality coverage, with values closer to 1 corresponding to the implantation in the most 
abnormal tissue (E). The resection of the strongest abnormalities defined by MEG and iEEG were 
quantified using the ùê∑ùê∑ ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ (F). ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ values closer to 0 correspond to the resection of the strongest 
abnormaliti es. The ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ was only computed using neocortical tissue with MEG and iEEG coverage. The 
abnormality coverage and ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ values per individual were used to classify post -operative seizure- freedom 
using a logistic regression model. Model output is visualised using a nomogram (G), with each measure 
accruing points depending on the feature weight. The more points a subject accrues the more likely they 
are to be classified as seizure-free.  
Results 
MEG abnormalities overlap with electrode placement in seizure- free patients  
We investigated whether intracranial EEG electrodes were implanted in areas of strongest MEG 
abnormality using the ‚Äòabnormality coverage‚Äô metric. Two example subjects are shown in Figure 2  with 
different surgical outcomes. In the seizure-free patient (Figure 2 A) a strong overlap exists between the 
iEEG electrode implantation and strongest MEG abnormalities. This is quantified with an abnormality coverage score of 0.82, signifying that electrodes were indeed implanted in the most abnormal neocortical 
tissue, as defined by resting -state interictal MEG band power.  
 
Figure 2: Overlapping MEG band power abnormalities and intracranial EEG electrode implantation.  
Neocortical interictal resting -state MEG band power abnormalities and iEEG electrode implantation in an 
example seizure-free patient (A). High overlap is present between MEG derived abnormalities and iEEG 
electrode placement, quantified with an abnormalit y coverage of 0.82. In this scenario we would expect 
post-operative seizure freedom as iEEG electrodes have targeted abnormal tissue presumed to contain the 
epileptogenic zone. (B) Conversely, this example subject with poor surgical outcome (ILAE 2+) has 
minimal overlap between MEG abnormalities and electrode placement (abnormality coverage=0.3). As 
such, we would expect poor surgical outcome as the presumed epileptogenic tissue was not targeted by 
intracranial electrodes for further monitoring. Spatial heatmaps correspond to MEG derived band power 
abnormalities, with blue points corresponding to the approximate localisation of iEEG electrodes. Boxplots 
(right panels) illustrate the abnormality of regions with, and without iEEG coverage (blue and orange 
respectively). Each data point corresponds to a single neocortical region of interest. The abnormality 
coverage (0.82 for patient A) reflects if the most abnormal regions had iEEG coverage. Values closer to 1 
corresponding to implantation exclusively in the most abnormal tissue and values of 0 to an implantation 
exclusively in the least abnormal tissue.  
 
In contrast to the seizure-free individual, figure 2 B illustrates the overlap between iEEG electrodes and 
MEG abnorma lities for a non-seizure-free subject. It is clear that electrode implantation does not overlap 
well with the MEG derived abnormalities, with the strongest abnormalities located in right occipital and 
parietal tissue, and electrodes implanted in left frontal tissue. The minimal overlap between iEEG electrode 
placement and MEG band power abnormalities is captured by the abnormality coverage measure with a value of 0.3.  
We expanded our analysis to the full cohort of 32 individuals, reporting the overlap betwe en electrode 
placement and MEG abnormalities (Figure 3). Individuals who were seizure -free post -operatively had 
greater overlap between MEG band power abnormalities and electrode placement, characterised by larger 
abnor mality coverage values, than non -seizure-free individuals. The implantation of electrodes in tissue of 
strongest MEG abnormality occurr ed in seizure-free patients (ILAE 1) greater than chance (T=3.9, 
p=0.003). The effect of electrodes overlapping with MEG abnormalities separates surgical outcome groups 
well (AUC=0.68).  
 
Figure 3: Surgical outcome separability of the abnormality coverage at a group level.  The boxplot shows 
the abnormality coverage measure for seizure-free (ILAE 1), and non-seizure-free subjects (ILAE 2+). 
Each data point corresponds to an individual subject. Seizure -free subjects are significantly greater than 
0.5 indicating coverage in regions with high MEG abnormality (T = 3.9 , p= 0. 003). This effect was not 
present for ILAE2+ patients.  
Taken together, these results suggest that patients had better outcomes if their MEG-derived abnormalities 
were sampled by intracranial EEG.  
Multimodal abnormality maps predict post -operative seizure freedom  
We next investigated if the strongest MEG and iEEG abnormalities were resected. To quantify this we used 
the ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ metric, considering only tissue which had MEG and iEEG coverage (Figure S1 ). In agreemen t with 
our prior studies20,32, the resection of the strongest abnormalities were typically observed in seizure-free 
patients. The effect separating surgical outcome groups well for both MEG, AUC=0.71, and iEEG, 
AUC=0.74. Subject data and measures are repor ted in Supplementary Table  1. 
We hypothesised that the combination of abnormality coverage and two ùê∑ùê∑ ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ measures would explain 
surgical outcome best. Our rationale was that ùê∑ùê∑ ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ would perform best for seizure -free patients only if 
abnormalites were actually covered, hence the inclusion of all three metrics. To combine measures, we used 
a logistic regression model and report the output as a nomogram (Figure 4 A). All three measures contributed 
towards the prediction o f post -operative seizure-freedom. The implantation of electrodes in MEG-defined 
abnormal regions, and subsequent concordance between MEG and iEEG, separated outcome groups best (Figure 4B). Robust measures of model perfor mance using a leave one out approach resulted in an average 
AUC of 0.79 [Min=0.77, Max=0.84].

illustrating the output of a logistic regression model trained using the abnormality coverage, MEG ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ, 
and iEEG ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ. Each feature accrues points towards a final score. The points for an individual subject 
based on their measures are totalled and subsequently compared across surgical outcome groups. Each 
green point corresponds to the results for a single seizure-free patient, whereas red points correspond to 
the results for a single non -seizure-free subjects. We hypothesised that the more points a subject accrued, 
the more likely they would be seizure-free post -operatively as the abnormality coverage indicates that 
potentially epileptogenic tissue had been targeted for iEEG monitoring and that MEG and iEEG are in 
agreement that that most abnormal tissue was resected. (B) For each individual, the total points calculated 
using the nomogram were compared across surgical outcome groups. The model results are presented as 
a boxplot and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Each point corresponds to a single individual 
(ILAE 1: green, ILAE 2+: red).  
 
Together, the results of this study suggest that resting -state interictal MEG band power abnormality 
mapping may provide localising information which can be leveraged for electrode implantation. 
Furthermore, we show that a multimodal model (incorporating both iEEG and MEG) offers clinically 
interpretable predictions which may be of value during the pre -surgical evaluation.  
  Discussion 
Accurate delineation and resection of epileptogenic tissue is key to achieve post -operative seizure-
freedom38. Intracranial EEG is widely used to delineate the EZ in difficult to localise individuals . 
Hypotheses of epileptogenic tissue location are required in order to  guide electrode implantation. In this 
study we demonstrated that data-driven measures of neocortical abnormality using interictal MEG band 
power are associated with electrode implantation strategies in successful surgery candidates. Moreover, we 
showed th at a multimodal model of post -surgical seizure-freedom outperforms any measure in isolation. 
Together, our results suggest that MEG band power abnormality mapping may complement current iEEG 
implantation strategies, providing clinically useful information to aid decision making during the pre -
surgical evaluation.  
Intracranial EEG recordings are used  if the mapping of epileptogenic tissue using non-invasive modalities 
are inconclusive, discordant, uncertain of epileptogenic network involvement, or indicate a  close proximity 
to eloquent tissue39‚Äì41. To minismise the risks attributed with iEEG42, and maximise its effectiveness, a clear 
hypothesis of the EZ is required in order to guide electrode implantation. At present, implantation strategies are determined b y clinical teams, usually based on visual evaluation of non-invasive modalities and seizure 
semiologies. Our MEG derived spatial maps of band power abnormalities indicate a stronger overlap between the most abnormal tissue and the implantation of iEEG electrodes in seizure-free subjects (Figure 3). As such, our data-driven abnormality maps may complement current strategies by validating the 
proposed electrode implantation, or by directing implantation to other brain area s. 
Several studies have proposed the use of MEG recordings to help inform iEEG electrode placement
14‚Äì19,43,44. 
Magnetic source imaging (MSI) indicated additional electrode coverage beyond the initially proposed 
hypothesis of epileptogenic tissue in 23% of subjects 16.  Moreover, in 39% of subjects, the authors report 
seizure-onset activity in the electrodes proposed by MSI. F requent, and densely clustered interictal MEG 
spikes were correlated with iEEG placement in 69% of subjects in whom the seizure onset zone  was 
localised 24.  Our study builds on this literature, using a data -driven framework to relate interictal MEG band 
power abnormalities to iEEG electrode placement without the need to mark interictal spikes.  
Interictal markers of the epileptogenic zon e have been developed using HFOs7,9,10,45,46, spikes3,4,47, and 
networks48‚Äì55. In this study we focus on the mapping of interictal band power abnormalities. Recent studies 
have demonstrated that the resection of the strongest abnormalities defined by iEEG32,56 and MEG20 in 
isolation are associated with post-surgical seizure-freedom. As MEG and iEEG recordings are sensitive to different types of sources
21,22 we investigated whether concordant markers of epileptogenic tissue derived from the same individuals using MEG and iEEG yielded a better resolution for the delineation of 
epileptogenic tissue. 
Our model of post -operative seizure freedom follows an intuitive thought -process. First, MEG 
abnormalities must be investigated by intracranial EEG electrodes. Seco nd, those regions must also be 
abnormal using iEEG. Third, those abnormal regions must be resected. If those three criteria are met then 
the chance of seizure freedom is extremely high. We presented our model of three properties using a nomogram, a visual tool used to illustrate complex multivariable linear models. Recent studies have 
proposed the use of nomograms in the context of epilepsy to aid prediction of post -operative seizure-
freedom
34,35 and cognitive decline36,37. Our multimodal model of post -surg ical seizure-freedom outperforms 
our single measures in isolation (AUC = 0.8 ). Interestingly, the feature weights of the model were roughly 
similar (Figure 4 a), suggesting all three contribute to the best predictions of outcome. Our  results indicate 
that MEG and iEEG band power abnormalities contain complementary information which may aid clinical 
decision making during the pre -surgical evaluation.  
 
This study has several strengths and limitations. One strength is the dat a-driven nature of MEG and iEEG 
band power abnormalities, negating the need for manual spike marking, which can be prone to human bias
57. Band power mapping however is relatively invariant to changes in spike rate and magnitude, and 
offers different inform ation32. A key limitation of this study is the sample size, though to our knowledge is 
still one of the largest quantitative studies of iEEG and MEG with gold -standard postoperative MRI for 
resection delineation. Nontheless, future studies using larger cohorts could validate the techniques proposed. Moreover, the difficulty in localising weak signals in subcortical structures precludes the accurate analysis of individuals with seizures of temporal origin. The addition of abnormality maps derived using 
structural modalities such as T1 weighted MRI or diffusion MRI may circumvent the current limitation of 
limited coverage in deep brain structures
58. 
Markers of epileptogenic tissue derived using iEEG have consistently been shown to relate to surgical outcome. Y et, iEEG implantation requires preconceived ideas of the location of epileptogenic tissue, 
usually acquired using qualitative techniques. We proposed interictal MEG band power abnormality 
mapping as a data-driven approach to complement current iEEG implant ation strategies. Our findings 
further highlight the clinical value of MEG band power abnormalities for individuals with drug refractory 
neocortical epilepsy.

Surgical outcome separability of the ùë´ùë´ùëπùëπùëπùëπ 
The ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ is a measure that was recently shown to relate to post -operative seizure freedom in cohorts of 
individuals with refractory epilepsy20,32. We compute the MEG and iEEG ùê∑ùê∑ ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ values for the cohort of 32 
individuals with refractory neocortical epilepsy using  only tissue that has coverage in both modalities. The 
results across the cohort, Figure S1  demonstrate the separability of surgical outcome groups based on the 
derived ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ scores. The ùê∑ùê∑ ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ for both modalities performs well and in the hypothesised direction, separating

differences between surgical outcome groups based on the corresponding ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ scores. Each point 
corresponds to an individual, green points correspond to seizure -free individuals, and red points to non-
seizure-free individuals. Both measures of ùê∑ùê∑ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ separate surgical outcome groups well and in the 
hypothesised direction. That is, with smaller ùê∑ùê∑ ùëÖùëÖùëÖùëÖ values attributed to seizure-free patients as the most 
abnormal tissue has been resected. Statistical significance of the AUC was calculated using a one -tailed 
Mann-Whitney U test.  
  
Table of patient data  
Summary of patient metadata and measures. Commonly acquired patient metadata are reported 
including the side of surgical resection, localisation  of the resection (F: Frontal, T: Temporal, P: Parietal, 
O: Occipital), one year post -operative outcome. Additionally, the abnormality coverage, and both D RS 
derived using MEG and iEEG data are reported.
