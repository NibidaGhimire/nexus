Abstract. We consider a Stokes-Magneto system in Rd(d≥2) with frac-
tional diﬀusions Λ2αuand Λ2βbfor the velocity uand the magnetic ﬁeld b,
respectively. Here α,βare positive constants and Λs= (−∆)s/2is the frac-
tional Laplacian of order s. We establish global existence of weak solutions
of the Stokes-Magneto system for any initial data in L2whenα,βsatisfy
1/2< α <(d+1)/2,β >0, and min {α+β,2α+β−1}> d/2. It is also shown
that weak solutions are unique if β≥1 and min {α+β,2α+β−1} ≥d/2+1,
in addition.
1.Introduction
For several decades, many authors have studied linear and nonline ar equations
with fractional diﬀusions from a mathematical point of view and applie d them to
diverse ﬁelds such as biology [5], ﬁnancial mathematics [2], and probab ility [30].
Particularly important models from ﬂuid mechanics are generalized Na vier-Stokes
equations (see e.g [12, 24, 25, 33]) and surface quasi-geographic e quations (see e.g.
[9, 11]).
In this paper, we consider the following initial value problem for a Stok es-
Magneto system with fractional diﬀusions in Rd,d≥2:
(1.1)

∂tb+ηΛ2βb+(u·∇)b= (b·∇)uinRd×(0,∞),
divu= divb= 0 in Rd×(0,∞),
b(·,0) =b0 onRd.
Hereu:Rd×[0,∞)→Rdis the velocity ﬁeld, b:Rd×[0,∞)→Rdis the
magnetic ﬁeld, and p∗:Rd×[0,∞)→Rdenotes the total pressure: p∗=p+1

withpbeing the pressure on the ﬂuid. The positive constants νandηstand
for the viscosity constant and the magnetic diﬀusivity, respective ly. Fors∈R,
Λs= (−∆)s/2denotes the fractional Laplacian of order s(see Section 2 for more
details).
Our model (1.1) was motivated by Moﬀatt [27, 28] who proposed the magnetic
relaxation method to construct magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) eq uilibria from a
given magnetic ﬁeld b0. More precisely, Moﬀatt [27] ﬁrst suggested the method of

magnetic relaxation to construct a magnetic equilibrium from a solutio n of ideal
MHD equations by letting t→ ∞. Later, in 2009, Moﬀatt suggested another
possible way to construct an MHD equilibrium by introducing the syste m (1.1)
withα= 1 andη= 0. See Beekie-Friedlander-Vicol [4], Constantin-Pasqualotto
[13], and references therein for further motivation of magnetic re laxation.
In comparison to (1.1), we recall the generalized MHD system:
(1.2)

∂tu+νΛ2αu+(u·∇)u+∇p∗= (b·∇)binRd×(0,∞),
∂tb+ηΛ2βb+(u·∇)b= (b·∇)uinRd×(0,∞),
divu= divb= 0 in Rd×(0,∞),
u(·,0) =u0,b(·,0) =b0 onRd.
Whenν,η >0 andα=β= 1, Duvaut-Lions [15] proved global existence of
weak solutions of (1.2) with L2-initial data. Later, Wu [37] extended this result
to arbitrary α,β >0 and also proved existence of global classical solutions for
smooth initial data when α,βsatisfyα,β≥d/4 + 1/2. The existence results in
[37] were later improved by the same author [38] when α≥d/4+1/2,β >0, and
α+β≥d/2+1. In addition to these results, many authors proved global reg ularity
of classical solutions of (1.2) in two-dimensional spaces under vario us hypotheses
onαandβ; see Yamazaki [39] and references therein. On the other hand, w hen
ν= 0 andη >0, Kozono [23] proved local existence and uniqueness of classical
solutions of (1.2) when β= 1. This result was extended to any β >0 by Wu [38]
for suﬃciently smooth initial data. Recently, Feﬀerman et.al [16, 17 ] established
local existence of strong solutions of (1.2) when ν >0,η= 0, andα= 1, which
was extended by Kim-Zhou [22] to general α.
In contrast to the generalized MHD system, there are few results for the Stokes-
Magneto system with or without fractional diﬀusions. When ν,η >0,α=β= 1,
andd= 2,3, McCormick-Robinson-Rodrigo [26] proved global existence of we ak
solutions of (1.1). For the two-dimensional case, they also proved uniqueness and
regularity of weak solutions. Recently, Ji-Tan [21] proved global ex istence of strong
solutions of (1.1) when d= 3,α= 1, andβ≥3/2. On the other hand, when ν >0,
η= 0, andα= 0, Brenier [7] proved global existence of dissipative weak solution s
on the two-dimensional torus T2. Whenν >0,η= 0, andα= 1, Feﬀerman
et.al. [16] proved local existence and uniqueness of strong solution s of (1.1) on Rd,
d= 2,3. Recently, when ν >0,η= 0, andα > d/2 + 1, Beekie-Friedlander-
Vicol [4] established global existence of strong solutions of (1.1) on the torus Td,
d= 2,3. Moreover, they also investigated 2D stability and 3D instability as w ell as
the long-time behavior of solutions.
In this paper, we establish global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of
the Stokes-Magneto system (1.1) with fractional diﬀusions. To ela borate a moti-
vation of our notion of weak solutions, we multiply the ﬁrst equation in (1.1) by
uand the second equation by b, and then integrate the resulting equations on Rd.
Using the divergence-free condition on uandb, we have

whereUαis a matrix-valued function satisfying
|Uα(x)| ≤C

for some constant Cdepending only on dandα. By Young’s convolution inequality
in weak spaces (Lemma 2.5), we deduce that

Lorentz spaces on Rd, respectively, where 1 ≤p <∞and 1≤q≤ ∞. Fors∈R,
let˙Hsbe the homogeneous Sobolev spaces on Rd(see Section 2 for details). Then
motivated by (1.3) and (1.5), we deﬁne weak solutions of (1.1) as follo ws.
Deﬁnition 1.1. Let 1/2<α<(d+1)/2 and 0<β <∞. Suppose that b0∈L2,
divb0= 0 inRd, and 0<T≤ ∞. Then a pair ( u,b) of vector ﬁelds satisfying
u∈L∞(0,T;Ld/(d+1−2α),∞)∩L2(0,T;˙Hα),
b∈L∞(0,T;L2)∩L2(0,T;˙Hβ)
is called a weak solution of (1.1) in [0 ,T) if the following are satisﬁed:

A weak solution of (1.1) in [0 ,∞) will be called a global weak solution .
Now we are ready to present the main results of the paper. We ﬁrst establish
existence of global weak solutions of (1.1) under a suitable assumpt ion onαandβ.4 HYUNSEOK KIM AND HYUNWOO KWON
Theorem 1.2. Letαandβsatisfy
1
2<α<d+1
2, β >0,andmin{α+β,2α+β−1}>d
2.
Then for any b0∈L2withdivb0= 0, there exists at least one global weak solution
of(1.1).
Next, we prove the time-continuity, energy identity, and uniquene ss of weak
solutions of (1.1) for larger values of αandβ.
Theorem 1.3. Letαandβsatisfy
1
2<α<d+1
2, β≥1,andmin{α+β,2α+β−1} ≥d
2+1.
Then for any b0∈L2withdivb0= 0, there exists a unique global weak solution
(u,b)of(1.1). Moreover, the solution (u,b)is continuous in Ld/(d+1−2α),∞×L2
and satisﬁes the energy identity (1.3)for anyt≥0.
Remark. (a) Assume that α= 1 andβ >d/2−1. Then it follows from Theorem
1.2 that for any b0∈L2with div b0= 0, there exists a global weak solution ( u,b)
of (1.1). This result extends the existence result of McCormick-Ro binson-Rodrigo
[26] who considered the case when d= 2,3 andβ= 1. Moreover, by Theorem 1.3,
weak solutions of (1.1) are unique if β≥d/2. Hence it follows from the existence
theorem for strong solutions due to Ji-Tan [21] that if d= 3 and b0∈H1, then
(u,b) satisﬁes the following strong regularity properties:
u∈C([0,T];H3/2)∩L2(0,T;H2),b∈C([0,T];H1)∩L2(0,T;H1+β)
for anyT <∞.
(b) Assume that β= 1 and max {1/2,d/2−1,d/4}< α <(d+ 1)/2. Then it
follows from Theorem 1.2 that for any b0∈L2with div b0= 0, the problem (1.1)
has global weak solutions. Moreover, by Theorem 1.3, weak solution s of (1.1) are
unique ifα≥d/2 in addition.
(c) Assume that 2 ≤d≤4 and (d+2)/6<α=β <(d+1)/2. Then it follows
from Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 that for any b0∈L2with div b0= 0, the problem (1.1)
has global weak solutions, which are unique if ( d+2)/4≤α=β <(d+1)/2.
One of our main tools to prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 is the following prod uct
estimate (see Lemma 2.8): if 1 /2< α<(d+1)/2,β >0, andα+β > d/2, then
there exist constants 0 <θ1,θ2<1 such that
(1.8) /⌊a∇d⌊lfg/⌊a∇d⌊l2/apprle/⌊a∇d⌊lf/⌊a∇d⌊l1−θ1
d/(d+1−2α),∞/⌊a∇d⌊lf/⌊a∇d⌊lθ1
˙Hα/⌊a∇d⌊lg/⌊a∇d⌊l1−θ2
2/⌊a∇d⌊lg/⌊a∇d⌊lθ2
˙Hβ
for allf∈Ld/(d+1−2α),∞∩˙Hαandg∈Hβ. Moreover, if α+(1−µ)β≥d/2+1
for some 0 ≤µ≤1, we can choose θ1andθ2so that (1 + µ)θ1+θ2+ 1/β≤2.
This additional condition enables us to establish uniqueness of weak s olutions of
(1.1). The estimate (1.8) will be derived from generalized Gagliardo-N irenberg
interpolation inequalities that were obtained recently by Byeon-Kim- Oh [8] and
Wang-Wei-Ye [36].
To prove existence of weak solutions (Theorem 1.2) of (1.1), we ﬁrs t construct
a family of solutions {(uR,bR)}of theR-truncated problems (5.4). Moreover, it is
shownthatthesesolutionssatisfyuniformbounds. Thenbyastan dardAubin-Lions
compactness argument combined with the estimate (1.8), we const ruct a sequence
of functions {bRk}that has strong convergence in L2(0,T;L2(K)) for every ﬁniteSTOKES-MAGNETO SYSTEM WITH FRACTIONAL DIFFUSIONS 5
T >0 and compact K⊂Rd. To show strong convergence of uRk, we utilize
the solution formula (1.4) for the fractional Stokes system that w ill be derived in
Section 3 (Theorem 3.9). Very weak solutions of the fractional Sto kes system are
introduced to apply the solution formula (1.4) for L1-data. Finally, making crucial
use ofthe assumption 2 α+β >d/2+1, we show that the nonlinearterms uRk⊗bRk
converge strongly in L1,loc(Rd×(0,∞)). The strong convergence properties of uRk
andbRkenable us to complete the proof of existence of weak solutions of (1 .1) by
passing to the limit k→ ∞. To prove uniqueness of weak solutions (Theorem 1.3),
we ﬁrst study weak solutions of perturbed fractional heat equat ions. Then applying
a standard Gronwall-type argument combined with product estimat es (Lemmas 2.8
and 2.9), we show that weak solutions are unique.
This paper proceeds in six sections and three appendix sections. In Section 2,
we introduce our notations, the fractional Laplacian, homogeneo us Sobolev spaces,
and Lorentz spaces. We also provide proofs of product estimates that play crucial
roles in proving existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. In Sect ion 3, we prove
the solution formula (1.4) for the fractional Stokes system. The n otion of very
weak solutions is also introduced. In Section 4, we prove existence a nd regularity
propertiesof weaksolutions of perturbed fractional heat equat ions that will be used
in the proofof uniqueness ofweak solutions of (1.1). The main theor ems are proved
in Sections 5 and 6. Finally we give somewhat detailed proofs of some te chnical
results in Appendices.

For two nonnegative quantities AandB, we writeA/apprleα,β,...BifA≤CBfor
some positive constant Cdepending on the parameters α,β, .... If the dependence

writeX ֒→YifXis continuously embedded into Y, that is, the embedding x/mapsto→x
is continuous. For a topological vector space X, we denote by X∗the (topological)
dual space of X. The dual pairing between X∗andXis denoted by /a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{t·,·/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht.
LetSandS′be the Schwartz class and the space of tempered distributions on

Rde2πix·ξf(ξ)dξ.
Iffis a tempered distribution, then ˆfandf∨are deﬁned via duality by

yJsf=/parenleftbig
1+4π2|·|2/parenrightbigs/2ˆfforf∈S′.
Forp= 2, we write Hs=Hs
2. Then the Sobolev space Hsis indeed a Hilbert space
equipped with the inner product
(u,v)Hs= (Jsu,Jsv)
with (·,·) denoting the inner product on L2. By the Plancherel theorem, we have
(u,v)Hs=ˆ

To deﬁne homogeneous Sobolev spaces, we need to introduce the f ollowing sub-
space of S:
S0={φ∈S:Dγˆφ(0) = 0 for all γ∈Nd
0}.
LetS′
0be the dual space of S0. Then since S0֒→S֒→L1∩L∞, we have
L1+L∞֒→S′֒→S′
0.
Moreover, it follows from the Hahn-Banach theorem that every f∈S′
0can be
extended to a tempered distribution F. Such anFis unique up to additive poly-
nomials, thanks to the following simple lemma (see e.g. [19, Proposition 1 .1.3]).

for allφ∈S0.
Then since Λs+t= ΛsΛtfor anys,t∈R, it follows that Λs:S0→S0is an
isomorphism with the inverse Λ−s. Hence for each u∈S′
0, we deﬁne Λsu∈S′

Note also that Λs:S′

0is an isomorphism.

˙Hs
p={f∈S′
0: Λsf∈Lp}.
Forp= 2, we write ˙Hs=˙Hs
p. The space ˙Hsis a Hilbert space equipped with the
inner product
(u,v)˙Hs= (Λsu,Λsv).
It should be remarked that Λt:˙Hs+t→˙Hsis an isometric isomorphism for any
s,t∈R. It is standard that Hs=L2∩˙Hsfor anys≥0 (see e.g. [6, Theorem
6.3.2]).
The following density results will be used several times in the paper.

(2)For eachφ∈S, there exists a sequence {φk}inS0such thatφk→φin

(3)S0is dense in both Hsand˙Hsfors∈R.
(4)S0is dense in Lp∩˙Hsfor1<p<∞ands∈R.
Proof.To prove Parts (1) and (2), we choose ψ∈C∞such that 0 ≤ψ≤1,ψ= 0
inB1, andψ= 1 outside B2. Givenφ∈S, we deﬁne φk(x) = [1−ψ(x/k)]φ(x)

Suppose that f∈˙Hsandu= Λsf. Then since Sis dense in L2, it follows
from Part (2) that there exists a sequence {uk}inS0such thatuk→uinL2. If
fk= Λ−suk, thenfk∈S0and/⌊a∇d⌊lfk−f/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hs=/⌊a∇d⌊luk−u/⌊a∇d⌊l2→0. This proves that S0
is dense in ˙Hs. Similarly, using Jsinstead of Λs, one easily shows that S0is dense
inHs. This proves Part (3). A proof of (4) will be given later in Appendix A. /square
An immediate consequence of Lemma 2.2 (3) is that every f∈˙H−scan be
extended to a bounded linear functional on ˙Hsin such a way that the inequality
(2.1) /a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tf,g/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht ≤ /⌊a∇d⌊lf/⌊a∇d⌊l˙H−s/⌊a∇d⌊lg/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hs
holds for all g∈˙Hs. Moreover, since L2is self-dual and Λt:˙Ht→L2is an
isomorphism for any t∈R, it is easily shown that ˙H−sis the dual space of ˙Hs.
Assume now that s>0. Then it can be shown (see e.g. [20, Lemma 1]) that Λs
is well-deﬁned on Sand maps StoSs, where

In particular, Λsis bounded from StoL1∩L∞. Hence for each u∈L1+L∞, we
can extend Λsuto a tempered distribution by deﬁning

2.3.Lorentz spaces. Let Ω be any domain in Rd. For a measurable function
f: Ω→C, thedecreasing rearrangement f∗offis deﬁned by
f∗(t) = inf{s>0 :df(s)≤t}(t>0),
wheredf(s) =|{x∈Ω :|f(x)|>s}|. For 1≤p<∞and 1≤q≤ ∞, we deﬁne

The set of all fsatisfying /⌊a∇d⌊lf/⌊a∇d⌊lp,q;Ω<∞is denoted by Lp,q(Ω) and called the
Lorentz space over Ω with indices pandq. It is well-known that Lp,q(Ω) is a
complete quasi-normed space and is normable if 1 <p<∞(see e.g. [32, Theorem
3.22]). Moreover, for 1 ≤p<∞, we have
Lp,1(Ω)֒→Lp,p(Ω) =Lp(Ω)֒→Lp,∞(Ω).
Using Lorentz spaces, we can reﬁne several well-known inequalities in analysis.
The ﬁrst one is H¨ older’s inequality in Lorentz spaces which was prove d by O’Neil
[29, Theorems 3.4, 3.5].

The second one is the following reﬁnement of Sobolev’s inequality (see e.g. [1,
Theorem 7.34] and [6, Theorem 6.5.1]).
Lemma 2.4. Let0<s<d/ 2. Then for all u∈˙Hs, we have
/⌊a∇d⌊lu/⌊a∇d⌊l2d/(d−2s),2/apprle/⌊a∇d⌊lu/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hs.
The third one is the following generalization of Young’s convolution ineq uality
due to O’Neil [29, Theorem 2.6] (see also [18, Theorems 1.2.13 and 1.4.2 4]).

2.4.Product estimates. In this subsection, we prove product estimates that will
be used in the paper. The ﬁrst product estimate plays a crucial role in the proof
of existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of (1.1).

To prove uniqueness of weak solutions of (1.1) particularly when 1 /2< α <1,
we also need the following product estimate.
Lemma 2.9. Letγ >d/2and0<s≤γ. Then for all f∈Hsandg∈Hγ,

whereC=C(d,γ,s)>0.
Proof.A proof is given in [22, Lemma 3.2]. However, we provide a detailed proo f
of the lemma for the sake of convenience.
Suppose that 0 <s<γ. Then since γ >d/2, there exists 2 <p<∞such that

3.Fractional Stokes equations
In this section, we consider the fractional Stokes equations in Rd,d≥2:
(3.1) Λ2αu+∇p∗= divF,divu= 0 inRd,
whereαis a real number. Here F= [Fjk]1≤j,k≤dis a given matrix-valued function
and divFis the vector ﬁeld whose j-th component is given by

and
{divdivF(ξ) = (2πiξ)⊗(2πiξ) :pF(ξ) =−4π2d/summationdisplay
j,k=1ξjξkpFjk(ξ).
This section consists of three subsections. In Subsection 3.1, we p rove solvability
results in Sobolev spaces for (3.1). In Subsection 3.2, we derive a so lution formula
for the problem (3.1) that will be used in several places in the rest of the paper.
Finally, very weak solutions of (3.1) are studied in Subsection 3.3.12 HYUNSEOK KIM AND HYUNWOO KWON
3.1.Solutions in Sobolev spaces. The problem (3.1) is ﬁrst solved in the class
S0by decoupling the fractional Stokes system into two elliptic equation s.
Lemma 3.1. Letαbe any real number. Then for each F∈S0, there exists a
unique solution (u,p∗)∈S0×S0of(3.1).
Proof.Suppose that F∈S0. Then since div F∈S0and ∆ = −Λ2is an isomor-
phism from S0onto itself, there exists a unique p∗∈S0such that
(3.2) ∆ p∗= divdiv FinRd.
LetIdenote the identity matrix. Then since Λ2α:S0→S0is an isomorphism,
there exists a unique u∈S0such that
(3.3) Λ2αu= div(F−p∗I) inRd.
Since div(p∗I) =∇p∗, we have
Λ2αu+∇p∗= divFinRd.
Moreover, taking the divergence in (3.3), we have
Λ2α(divu) = divdiv F−∆p∗= 0 inRd.
Since div u∈S0and Λ2α:S0→S0is an isomorphism, it follows that div u= 0
inRd. This proves existence of a solution in S0×S0of (3.1).
To prove the uniqueness assertion, let ( u,p∗)∈S0×S0be a solution of (3.1)
with the trivial data F=0. Then since div u= 0 inRdand Λ2αdiv = divΛ2αin
S0, we take the divergence in (3.1) to obtain
∆p∗= 0 inRd.
Since ∆ : S0→S0is an isomorphism, it follows that p∗= 0 inRd. Then since
Λ2αu=0inRd, we conclude that u=0inRd. This completes the proofof Lemma
3.1. /square
Using the decomposition of (3.1) into (3.2) and (3.3), we proveunique solvability
of (3.1) in homogeneous Sobolev spaces of arbitrary orders.
Theorem 3.2. Letα,s∈R. Then for each F∈˙Hs, there exists a unique solution
(u,p∗)in˙H2α+s−1×˙Hsof(3.1). Moreover, we have
/⌊a∇d⌊lu/⌊a∇d⌊l˙H2α+s−1+/⌊a∇d⌊lp∗/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hs/apprle/⌊a∇d⌊lF/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hs.
Proof.Suppose that F∈˙Hs. Then since divdiv F∈˙Hs−2and ∆ is an isometric
isomorphism from ˙Ht+2to˙Htfor anyt∈R, there exists a unique solution p∗∈˙Hs
of (3.2), which satisﬁes
/⌊a∇d⌊lp∗/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hs/apprle/⌊a∇d⌊lF/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hs.
Moreover,sinceΛ2αisanisomorphismfrom ˙H2α+s−1to˙Hs−1, thereexistsaunique
u∈˙H2α+s−1satisfying (3.3). Note also that
/⌊a∇d⌊lu/⌊a∇d⌊l˙H2α+s−1/apprle/⌊a∇d⌊lF/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hs+/⌊a∇d⌊lp∗/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hs/apprle/⌊a∇d⌊lF/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hs.
Finally, since div u∈˙H2α+s−2and Λ2α(divu) = 0 in ˙Hs−2, it follows that div u=
0 inRd. This proves the existence assertion of the theorem.
To show the uniqueness, suppose that ( u,p∗)∈˙H2α+s−1×˙Hssatisﬁes (3.1)
withF=0. Since div u= 0 inRdand Λ2αdiv = divΛ2αinS′
0, it follows from
(3.1) that ∆ p∗= 0 inRd. Since ∆ is an isomorphism, we then deduce that p∗= 0STOKES-MAGNETO SYSTEM WITH FRACTIONAL DIFFUSIONS 13
inRd. From (3.1) again, we have Λ2αu=0inRd. Since Λ2αis an isomorphism,
we then conclude that u=0inRd. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.2. /square
Theorem 3.3. Letαbe any real number. Then for each F∈˙H1−α, there exists a
unique solution (u,p∗)in˙Hα×˙H1−αof(3.1). Moreover, we have
/⌊a∇d⌊lu/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hα+/⌊a∇d⌊lp∗/⌊a∇d⌊l˙H1−α/apprle/⌊a∇d⌊lF/⌊a∇d⌊l˙H1−α.

(3.4)ˆ
Rd|Λαu|2dx=/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tdivF,u/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht.
Proof.By Theorem 3.2, it remains to show that the solution ( u,p∗) in˙Hα×˙H1−α
of (3.1) satisﬁes the energy identity (3.4). Note ﬁrst thatˆ

/⌊a∇d⌊luk−u/⌊a∇d⌊l˙Hα→0. For each k, we have
ˆ

Since div u= 0, we get the energy identity (3.4). This completes the proof of
Theorem 3.3. /square
3.2.A solution formula. GivenF= [Fjk]1≤j,k≤d∈S0, let (u,p∗)∈S0×S0

3.3.Very weak solutions. The notion of very weak solutions is introduced to
solve the fractional Stokes system (3.1) for F∈L1. Recall that if s≥0, then Λsis
bounded from StoL1∩L∞.
Deﬁnition 3.5. Letα≥0. Suppose that Fis a distribution. Then we say that
u∈L1+L∞is avery weak solution of (3.1) if

Indeed, taking Φ = 0 in (3.6), we deduce that if uis a very weak solution of
(3.1), then it is divergence-free:ˆ
Rdu·∇ψdx= 0 for all ψ∈C∞
c.
Existence of a pressure associated with a very weak solution of (3.1 ) is an easy
consequenceof the following more or less standard result, which will be provedlater
in Appendix C.
Lemma 3.6. Ifu∈S′satisﬁes /a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tu,Φ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht= 0for allΦ∈C∞
c,σ, then there exists
p∈S′such that u=∇p.
Lemma 3.7. Letα≥0. Ifuis a very weak solution of (3.1)withF∈S′, then
there exists p∗∈S′such thatˆ

Proof.SinceC∞

Rdu·∇ψdx= 0 for all ψ∈S.
Note that Λ2αu−divF∈S′. Moreover, for all Φ ∈C∞
c,σ, we have

We are now able to prove uniqueness of very weak solutions of (3.6).
Lemma 3.8. Letα≥0. Ifu∈L1+L∞is a very weak solution of (3.1)with
F=0, thenuis constant. In addition, if u∈Lq,∞for some 1<q <∞, thenu
is identically zero.
Proof.By Lemma 3.7, there exists p∗∈S′such thatˆ
Rdu·Λ2αΦdx−/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tp∗,divΦ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht= 0 andˆ
Rdu·∇ψdx= 0
for all (Φ,ψ)∈S.16 HYUNSEOK KIM AND HYUNWOO KWON
Letψ∈S0be given. Then since ∇ψ∈S0, Λ2αψ∈S0, and Λ2α∇ψ=∇Λ2αψ,
we have
/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tp∗,∆ψ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht=ˆ
Rdu·Λ2α∇ψdx=ˆ
Rdu·∇(Λ2αψ)dx= 0.
Since ∆ = −Λ2:S0→S0is an isomorphism, it follows from Lemma 2.1 that p∗
is a polynomial. Hence, for all Φ ∈S0, we haveˆ
Rdu·Λ2αΦdx=/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tp∗,divΦ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht= 0.
Therefore, by Lemma 2.1 again, uis a polynomial. It is easy to check that polyno-
mials inL1+L∞are constant and the only constant function belonging to Lq,∞is
the zero function. This completes the proof of Lemma 3.8. /square
The following theorem shows existence and uniqueness of very weak solutions in
Lqof (3.1) when F∈Lp, where 1<p<d/ (2α−1) and 1/q= 1/p−(2α−1)/d.
Theorem 3.9. Let1/2< α <(d+ 1)/2,1< p < d/ (2α−1), and1/q= 1/p−
(2α−1)/d. Then for each F∈Lp, there exists a unique very weak solution uin
Lqof(3.1). Moreover, the solution uis given by u=Uα∗Fand satisﬁes
/⌊a∇d⌊lu/⌊a∇d⌊lq/apprle/⌊a∇d⌊lF/⌊a∇d⌊lp.

We now show that uis a very weak solution of (3.1). To show this, choose a

For all (Φ,ψ)∈S0, we haveˆ

To complete the proof, suppose in addition that F∈˙H1−α. Then by Lemma
2.2, there is a sequence {Gl}inS0such that Gl→Fin bothLpand˙H1−α. By
Lemma 3.1, there exists a unique solution ( vl,˜p∗,l)∈S0×S0of (3.1) with F=Gl.

Hence ifβ≥1, then every weak solution of (4.1) belongs to L2β(0,T;˙H1).
This section consists of two parts. We ﬁrst show that if F∈L2β/(2β−1)(0,T;L2),
β≥1, andb0∈L2, then there exists a unique weak solution of (4.1) with u= 0
satisfying the energy identity. Next, extending this result to nonz erou, we prove
that ifβ≥1 andu∈L∞(0,T;Ld/(d+1−2α),∞)∩L2(0,T;˙Hα), then for every
F∈L2β/(2β−1)(0,T;L2) andb0∈L2, there exists a unique weak solution bof
(4.1). Moreover, the solution bsatisﬁes the energy identity, which will be used to
prove uniqueness of weak solutions of the original nonlinear problem (1.1).
To prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of (4.1) when u= 0, we
introduce the Fourier truncation operators SR(R>0) deﬁned by
ySRf(ξ) =χBR(ξ)ˆf(ξ) (f∈L2),
whereχBRis the characteristic function of BR. The following properties of SRare
quite elementary.

(3)Iff∈Ht, then/⌊a∇d⌊lSRf−f/⌊a∇d⌊lHs/apprle(1+R)−(t−s)/⌊a∇d⌊lf/⌊a∇d⌊lHt.
ForR >0, we denote by VRthe space of all vector ﬁelds b∈L2such that
suppˆb⊂BR. Note that VRis a closed subspace of L2. Moreover, since SRb=b
for anyb∈VR, it follows from Lemma 4.1 that VRis continuously embedded into
Hsfor anys≥0.
Lemma 4.2. Suppose that β≥1andγ= 2β/(2β−1). Then for every F∈
Lγ(0,T;L2)andb0∈L2, there exists a unique weak solution bof(4.1)withu= 0.
Moreover, bbelongs toC([0,T];L2)and satisﬁes the energy identity:

truncated problem for bk∈C1([0,T);Vk):
(4.3)/braceleftBigg
∂tbk+Λ2βbk= divSkFkinRd×(0,T)
bk(·,0) =Skb0onRd.
Since Λ2β:Vk→Vkis a bounded linear operator, it follows from a standard theory
of linear diﬀerential equations (see e.g. Cartan [10, Theorem 1.9.1]) in Banach
spaces that the problem (4.3) has a unique solution bk∈C1([0,T];Vk).
Givenk,m∈N, write˜b=bk−bm,˜F=SkFk−SmFm, and˜b0=Skb0−Smb0.

and satisﬁes the energy identity (4.10). Let bbe a weak solution of (4.1) with
F∈L2β/(2β−1)(0,T;L2). Thenbsatisﬁes

Rd˜F:∇bdx=ˆ

Hence it follows from Lemma 4.2 that bbelongs to C([0,T];L2) and satisﬁes the
energy identity (4.10).
Uniqueness of weak solutions of (4.1) is an immediate consequence of the energy
identity. Indeed, if bis a weak solution of (4.1) with ( F,b0) = (0,0), then since it
satisﬁes the energy identity, we have

To complete the proof, it remains to prove existence of a weak solut ion of (4.1).
To prove this, we may consider truncated problems as in the proof o f Lemma22 HYUNSEOK KIM AND HYUNWOO KWON
4.2. The resulting truncated problems are still linear but non-auton omous with
coeﬃcients being singular in time. To avoid this diﬃculty, we apply the Ga lerkin
approximation method. Choose a sequence {Φk}inSsuch that the span of {Φk}
is dense in Hβand{Φk}is orthonormal in L2. Then for a ﬁxed m∈N, we seek a

from a standard theory of ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) that there exists
a unique absolutely continuous function cm: [0,T]→Rmsatisfying (4.12).

By virtue of Lemma 5.1, we may consider the following truncated prob lem for
bR∈C1([0,∞);VR,σ):
(5.4)

uR=Uα∗(bR⊗bR) in Rd×(0,∞),
bR(·,0) =PSRb0 onRd,
whereb0∈L2with div b0= 0 is given. Note here that if bR∈C1([0,T);VR,σ),
0<T≤ ∞, anduR=Uα∗(bR⊗bR), then by Lemma 5.1,
uR∈C([0,T);Ld/(d+1−2α),∞)

Moreover, it follows from Theorem 3.10 that for each t∈(0,T),uR(t) is a very
weak solution of the fractional Stokes system
(5.6) Λ2αuR(t)+∇p∗(t) = div(bR(t)⊗bR(t)),divuR(t) = 0 in Rd;

for all (Φ,ψ)∈Swith divΦ = 0. We shall show that for each R >0, there
exists a unique solution bR∈C1([0,∞);VR,σ) of theR-truncated problem (5.4)
and then that some sequence {(uRk,bRk)}converges to a weak solution of the
original problem (1.1).
5.2.Existence of approximate solutions. Let 0< R <∞be ﬁxed. For b∈
VR,σ, we deﬁne
GR(b) =−Λ2βb+PSR[div(b⊗u−u⊗b)],
whereu=Uα∗(b⊗b). ByLemma5.1, GRis awell-deﬁnedmappingfrom VR,σinto
VR,σ. Therefore, the R-truncated problem (5.4) can be rewritten as the following
Cauchy problem on an ODE in the Hilbert space VR,σ:
(5.8)/braceleftBigg
∂tbR(t) =GR(bR(t)) (0<t<∞),
bR(0) =PSRb0,
whereb0∈L2with div b0= 0 is given.
Suppose that bi∈VR,σandui=Uα∗(bi⊗bi) fori= 1,2. Then since

/⌊a∇d⌊lΛ2βb1−Λ2βb2/⌊a∇d⌊l2/apprleR/⌊a∇d⌊lb1−b2/⌊a∇d⌊l2.

which implies that GRis locally Lipschitz continuous on VR,σ. Therefore it follows
from Picard’s theorem for ODEs in inﬁnite dimensional spaces that fo r everyb0∈
L2with div b0= 0, theR-truncated problem (5.4) has a unique local classical
solution bR∈C1([0,TR);VR,σ). Here 0<TR≤ ∞denotes the maximal existence
time of the local solution bR. Indeed, bRexists globally, that is, TR=∞. To show
this, let uR=Uα∗(bR⊗bR). SinceVR,σ֒→Hs֒→˙Hsand (˙Hs)∗=˙H−sfor
anys≥0, it follows that bR⊗bR∈C([0,TR);˙H1−α).Hence by Theorem 3.9, uR
belongs toC([0,TR);˙Hα) and satisﬁes the energy identityˆ

which proves that {∂tbR}is bounded in Lr(0,T;H−s) for any 0 <T <∞./square
5.3.Completion of the proof of Theorem 1.2. We have shown that for each
0< R <∞, theR-truncated problem (5.4) has a unique global solution bR∈
C1([0,∞);VR,σ). By (5.5) and (5.9), the families {bR}R>0and{uR}R>0are
boundedin L∞(0,∞;L2)∩L2(0,∞;˙Hβ)andL∞(0,∞;Ld/(d+1−2α),∞)∩L2(0,∞;˙Hα),
respectively.
By the weak-* compactness result and (5.9), there exists a seque nce{Rk}with
Rk→ ∞such that
uRk→uweakly-* in L∞(0,∞;Ld/(d+1−2α),∞)∩L2(0,∞;˙Hα)
and
bRk→bweakly-* in L∞(0,∞;L2)∩L2(0,∞;˙Hβ)
for some ( u,b) satisfying

ByLemma 5.2andthe Aubin-Lions compactnesslemma, thereexists a subsequence
of{bRk}, denoted still by {bRk}, such that
(5.12) bRk→binL2(K×(0,T))
for any compact K⊂Rdand ﬁniteT >0. Moreover, by (5.9), we have
/⌊a∇d⌊lbRk⊗bRk−b⊗b/⌊a∇d⌊l1;K≤ /⌊a∇d⌊lbRk⊗(bRk−b)/⌊a∇d⌊l1;K+/⌊a∇d⌊l(bRk−b)⊗b/⌊a∇d⌊l1;K

and so
(5.13) bRk⊗bRk→b⊗binL2(0,T;L1(K))
for any compact K⊂Rdand ﬁniteT >0.
Next, we show that
(5.14) uRk→Uα∗(b⊗b) inL2(0,T;Ld/(d+1−2α),∞(K))
for any ﬁnite Tand compact K⊂Rd, which automatically implies that
(5.15) u=Uα∗(b⊗b);STOKES-MAGNETO SYSTEM WITH FRACTIONAL DIFFUSIONS 27
henceusatisﬁes (1.6).
Letv=Uα∗(b⊗b). Fixing 0 <r,T < ∞, we write
uRk(x,t)−v(x,t) =ˆ

for (x,t)∈Br×(0,T), whereM >1 is a large number to be determined later.
Recall from (3.5) that
|Uα(x)|/apprle1
|x|d+1−2α.
Hence by Lemma 2.5 and (5.13), we have
/⌊a∇d⌊lIk
1/⌊a∇d⌊lL2(0,T;Ld/(d+1−2α),∞)/apprle/⌊a∇d⌊lUα/⌊a∇d⌊ld/(d+1−2α),∞/⌊a∇d⌊lbRk⊗bRk−b⊗b/⌊a∇d⌊lL2(0,T;L1(BM+r))

To estimate |Ik

Then by Proposition 2.6,

Hence setting q= 2/θ, we have

and similarly
/⌊a∇d⌊lb/⌊a∇d⌊lLq(0,∞;Lp)/apprle/⌊a∇d⌊lb0/⌊a∇d⌊l2.
On the other hand, since d+1−2α−d(p−2)/p>0, it follows that if |x| ≤r, then

Therefore, noting that q≥4, we deduce that

for some constant C(r,T) independent of kandM.
Now, letδ>0 be given. Then choosing M >1 so large that
C(r,T)M−[d+1−2α−d(p−2)/p]/⌊a∇d⌊lb0/⌊a∇d⌊l2

and then letting k→ ∞, we have

k→∞/⌊a∇d⌊luRk−v/⌊a∇d⌊lL2(0,T;Ld/(d+1−2α),∞(Br))≤δ,
which proves (5.14).28 HYUNSEOK KIM AND HYUNWOO KWON
Finally, we show that
(5.16)uRk⊗bRk→u⊗binL1(K×(0,T)),
bRk⊗uRk→b⊗uinL1(K×(0,T))
for any compact K⊂Rdand ﬁniteT >0. By symmetry, it suﬃces to show the
ﬁrst assertion. We write
uRk⊗bRk−u⊗b= (uRk−u)⊗bRk+u⊗(bRk−b).
First, since 1 /2< α <(d+ 1)/2,β >0, and 2α+β > d/2 + 1, there exists

where 0< θ1<1 is deﬁned by 1 /p1= 1/2−(θ1β)/d. LetK⊂Rdbe compact.
Then since 1 /p1>1/2−β/dandd/(2α−1)<p1, it follows from Lemma 2.3 and
the Sobolev embedding theorem that

It follows from Lemma 4.3 that b⊗u∈L2β/(2β−1)(0,T;L2) for anyT <∞. Hence
by Theorem 4.4, bbelongs toC([0,∞);L2) and satisﬁes

for almost all t∈(0,∞). Using Young’s inequality (Lemma 2.5), we easily deduce
thatu∈C([0,∞);Ld/(d+1−2α),∞). Let 1< p < d/ (2α−1) be chosen so that
Hβ֒→L2p. Then it follows from H¨ older’s inequality and Lemma 2.10 that
b(t)⊗b(t)∈Lp∩˙H1−αand div( b(t)⊗b(t)) = (b(t)·∇)b(t)∈L2p/(p+1)
for almost all t∈(0,∞). Hence by Theorem 3.9 and Lemma 4.3, usatisﬁes
(6.2)ˆ
Rd|Λαu(t)|2dx=ˆ
Rd(b(t)·∇)b(t)·u(t)dx
for almost all t∈(0,∞). Adding (6.1) and (6.2) and then integraing over (0 ,t), we
get the energy identity (1.3) for any t≥0.
To complete the proof of Theorem 1.3 it remains to prove the uniquen ess asser-
tion. Let ( u1,b1) and (u2,b2) be two weak solutions of (1.1) for the same initial
datab0∈L2with div b0= 0. Write ˜u=u1−u2and˜b=b1−b2. Then ( ˜u,˜b)
satisﬁes
∂t˜b+Λ2β˜b+(u1·∇)˜b= div(˜b⊗u1+b2⊗˜u−˜u⊗b2)
and
˜u=Uα∗(˜b⊗b1+b2⊗˜b).
Moreover, by Lemma 4.3,
ui⊗bj∈L2β/(2β−1)(0,T;L2) and bi∈L2β(0,T;˙H1)
for anyT <∞, wherei,j= 1,2. Hence by Theorem 4.4, we have

Forj∈Z, letψj(ξ) =ψ(2−jξ) andϕj(ξ) =ϕ(2−jξ). Then the Littlewood-Paley

The following inequalities of Bernstein type are also easily proved by us ing

Proposition A.2. Let1≤p≤q≤ ∞,k∈N0, and0< R <∞. Then for all

Note then that

Letk= max{0,⌊s⌋+2}, where⌊s⌋is the greatest integer less than or equal to

Appendix B.Proof of Lemma 3.4
Our proof of Lemma 3.4 is based on the following well-known result (see e.g. [31,

We will also use the method of analytic continuation. The following resu lt is
useful to show the analyticity of some functions deﬁned by integra ls.
Lemma B.2. Fixφ∈Sandβ∈Nd
0. Then the function
f(z) =ˆ
Rdxβ|x|zφ(x)dx
is holomorphic in the region H={z∈C: Rez >−d−|β|}.34 HYUNSEOK KIM AND HYUNWOO KWON
Proof.Letz∈Hbe ﬁxed. Choose ε>0 such that {w∈C:|w−z| ≤ε} ⊂H.
Suppose that x/\e}atio\slash= 0. Then the function |x|w= exp(wln|x|) is entire and
d
dw[|x|w] = (log|x|)|x|w.
Hence for all w∈Bε(z) withw/\e}atio\slash=z,/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle|x|w−|x|z
w−z/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤ |log|x||max
|η−z|≤ε||x|η|=|log|x|||x|Rez+ε.
Moreover, since Re z+ε>−d−|β|, we haveˆ
Rd/vextendsingle/vextendsinglexβlog|x||x|Rez+εφ(x)/vextendsingle/vextendsingledx=ˆ
Rd|log|x|||x|Rez+ε+|β||φ(x)|dx<∞.
Hence it follows from the dominated convergence theorem that

w−z=ˆ
Rdxβ(log|x|)|x|zφ(x)dx.
This completes the proof of Lemma B.2. /square

This identity holds for 1 <Reλ<d+1, by Lemma B.2 and analytic continuation

thenu=∇pfor some distribution p. We provethat if uis a tempered distribution,
thenpis also a tempered distribution by following the idea of Wang [35]. It will
be ﬁrst shown (see Lemma C.2 below) that for each g∈S(Rd) with´
Rdgdx= 0,
there exists wg∈S(Rd;Rd) such that
divwg=ginRd.
The following lemma is necessary to show that wg∈S(Rd;Rd) and the mapping

ThenT(j)is a linear operator from S(j)

We have shown that T(1)maps S(1)
#toS. Linearity of T(1)is obvious from
the very deﬁnition of T(1). Hence to complete the proof, it remains to prove the
continuity property of T(1).
Suppose that uk∈S(1)
#anduk→0 inS. Letα,β∈Nd
0be ﬁxed. Then since
uk→0 inS, it follows that if β1>0, then

Lemma C.2. Fixφi∈C∞
c(R)with´
Rφidx= 1(i= 1,2,...,d) and deﬁne
φ(x) =φ1(x1)···φd(xd)for allx= (x1,...,x d)∈Rd.
Then there exists a continuous linear operator BfromS(Rd)toS(Rd;Rd)such
that
(C.2) div B(g) =g−φˆ
RdgdxinRd
for allg∈S(Rd).
Proof.For the sake of notational simplicity, we mainly focus on the case d= 3.
The general case can be proved in a similar way.
For a ﬁxed g∈S(R3), we deﬁne
g=g−φˆ
R3gdx.
Also for 1 ≤j≤3, letS(j)(g) :R3→Rbe deﬁned by
S(1)(g)(x) =g(x)−φ1(x1)ˆ
Rg(s1,x2,x3)ds1,
S(2)(g)(x) =φ1(x1)/bracketleftbiggˆ
Rg(s1,x2,x3)ds1−φ2(x2)ˆ
R2g(s1,s2,x3)ds1ds2/bracketrightbigg
,
S(3)(g)(x) =φ1(x1)φ2(x2)/bracketleftbiggˆ
R2g(s1,s2,x3)ds1ds2/bracketrightbigg
.
Then it is easy to check that S(j)is a linear operator from S(R3) into S(j)
#and
that ifgk→0 inS, thenS(j)(gk)→0 inS.
Now, for each g∈S, we deﬁne
B(g) =/parenleftBig
T(1)S(1)(g),T(2)S(2)(g),T(3)S(3)(g)/parenrightBig
.
Then by Lemma C.1, Bis a continuous linear operator from S(R3) toS(R3;R3).
Moreover, by a direct computation,
divB(g) =S(1)(g)+S(2)(g)+S(3)(g) =ginR3.38 HYUNSEOK KIM AND HYUNWOO KWON

Proof of Lemma 3.6. Suppose that u∈S′satisﬁes /a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tu,Φ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht= 0 for all Φ ∈C∞
c,σ.
Then by a simple density argument, we have
(C.3) /a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tu,Φ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht= 0 for all Φ ∈Swith divΦ = 0 .
LetB:S(Rd)→S(Rd;Rd) be the operator deﬁned in Lemma C.2. Then since
Bis linear and continuous, the mapping
g/mapsto→ −/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tu,B(g)/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht
deﬁnes a continuous linear functional ponS.
Given Φ ∈S, we deﬁne g= divΦ and Ψ = B(g)−Φ. Then Ψ ∈S. Moreover,
since´
Rdgdx= 0, we have
divΨ = div B(g)−divΦ = 0 in Rd.
Hence it follows from (C.3) that /a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tu,Ψ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht= 0. Therefore,
/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tu,Φ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht=/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tu,B(g)/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht=−/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tp,g/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht=−/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tp,divΦ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht.
Since Φ ∈Sis arbitrary, we deduce that u=∇p. This completes the proof of
Lemma 3.6. /square
