ABSTRACT  
 
The recently released IEEE 802.15.6 standard specifies several physical (PHY) layer and medium access 
control (MAC) layer protocols for variety of medical and non -medical application s of Wireless Body Area 
Networks (WBAN). The most suitable way for enhancing network performance is to be the choice of 
different MAC and PHY parameters based on quality of service (QoS) requirements of different 
applications. The i mpact of different MAC a nd PHY parameters on the network performance and  the trade -
off relationship between the parameters are essential to overcome the limitations of exiting carrier sense 
multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme  of IEEE 802.15.6 standard . To ad dress this 
issue,  we develop a Markov chain -based analytical model of IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA for all user 
priorities (UPs) and apply this general model to different network scenarios to investigate the effects of the 
packet arrival rate,  channel condition , payload size,  access phase length , access mechanism  and number of 
nodes  on the performance parameters viz. reliability, normalized throughput, energy consumption  and 
average access delay . Moreover, we conclud e the effectiveness of different access phases , access 
mechanisms and user priorities of intra -WBAN.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
In the era of advanced technology, increasing needs of aging population, rising costs of 
healthcare, limited healthcare resources, especially during worldwide pandemic like COVID -19, 
have triggered the concepts of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) as a p rimary part of the 
ubiquitous Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems and received considerable attention in the 
academy and industry. The WBAN is composed of a limited number of tiny, low -power, low -
cost, wearable or implantable, intelligent, and hetero geneous medical sensors that are deployed 
in, on or around the proximity of the human body for continuously sensing vital physiological 
signals. The sensed signals are then aggregated at a coordinator via a short -range, low power 
wireless communication, pr ovided by IEEE 802.15.6 standard [ 1] and forwarded to the servers 
for further analysis. It offers numerous medical and non -medical applications in ubiquitous 
healthcare, military and defen ce, sports and fitness, and entertainment fields for improving the 
quality of human life, described in detail in  [2] – [4]. Each WBAN application has some specific 
QoS requirements like reliability, latency, security, and power consumption [5]. The 
communication architecture of WBANs is the combination of three different t iers: Tire -1, known 
as intra -WBAN communication, Tire -2, known as inter -WBAN communication,  and Tire-3, and 
known  as beyond -WBAN communication  [5] – [7]. The IEEE 802.15 Task Group 6 has International Journal of Wireless & Mobile Networks (IJWMN), Vol.15, No.6, December 2023  
26 developed a new communication standard, IEEE 802.15.6 that specifies the PHY and MAC 
layers specifications for WBAN. The IEEE 802.15.6 standard defines MAC sub -layer that acts as 
a lower sub -layer of the data link layer of the OSI model. It utilizes two types of access 
mechanisms including: contention -based access and conte ntion -free access. The contention -based  
CSMA/CA mechanism used in IEEE 802.15.6 standard has significant differences with the 
CSMA/CA mechanism of the others wireless communication standards viz. IEEE 802.11, IEEE 
802.11e and IEEE 802.15.4  [7] – [9].  These differences make the necessity of a new analytical 
model to evaluate the performance of the IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA. The overall performance of 
the WBAN mainly depends on the parameters  of MAC and PHY layer, defined by IEEE 802.15.6 
standard. To fulfil  the desired QoS requirements and maintaining balance among the trade -off 
performance metrics for specific applications of WBAN by selecting optimal parameters  has still 
the major issue.  In the IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA mechanism, the major parameters  of MAC and 
PHY lay ers that could affect its  performance include: packet arrival rate , channel condition , 
payload size, access phase length, number of nodes, acces s mechanism , traffic conditions and 
traffic differentiation . To the best of our knowledge, none of the current research works have 
considered all the above -mentioned parameters in modelling the IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA and 
investigated the effects of these parameters on the performance metrics, viz. reliability, 
normalized throughput, energy consumption, and a verage access delay together.  
 
In this paper , we present an extensive and comprehensive evaluation of IEEE 802.15.6 
CSMA/CA through analytical analysis using Markov chain. Moreover, we identify the key 
parameters  of MAC and PHY layer that have significant impact on overall system performance. 
The main contributions of this  paper are summarized as  
 
● We present a comprehensive view of the comparisons that describes the limitations, 
assumptions and findings of existi ng Markov chain -based analytical models of IEEE 
802.15.6 CSMA/CA MAC protocol in WBAN.  
● We develop an analytical model using 2 -D Markov chain for IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA 
MAC protocol and derive the relationship among channel idle probability, channel access

energy consumption and average access delay to find more accurate value.

phase length , access mechanism  and number of nodes  on performance metrics.

effectiveness of RTS/CTS access mechanism over basic access mechanism.

brief overviews the IEEE 802.15.6 standard. In Section 4, a Markov chain -based analytical model 
for IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA is described. The expressions for different performance metrics are

Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper and gives the future work outlines.  
 
2. RELATED WORKS  
 
There are several literatures [9] – [20] that explore the performance analysis of IEEE 802.15.6 
CSMA/CA  using Markov chain model.  In [9], the authors proposed an analytical model for all 
UPs to investi gate the impact of access phase length  on throughput and average backoff time  in 
saturated traff ic condition . The effects of number o f nodes and packet arrival rate  are not 
mentioned in their evaluation part and two important performance metrics, reliability and energy International Journal of Wireless & Mobile Networks (IJWMN), Vol.15, No.6, December 2023  
27 consumption are not considered.  In [10], Sarkar et al . proposed a user priority  wise and Markov 
chain-based analytical model of IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA for noisy channel and situation traffic 
condition to evaluate some performance parameters viz. reliability, throughput, energy 
consumption and average delay by taking into account the ackn owledgement time or timeout 
after transmitting packets. The effects of channel condition, packet size and data rate on the 
performance metrics are also presented.  In [11], user priority  wise DTMC analysis was 
performed to evaluate the performance of slotted CSMA/CA in IEEE 802.15.6 standard for noisy 
channel and situation traffic condition. However, slotted CSMA/CA mechanism is not specified 
in IEEE 802.15.6 standard.  Quan et al. [ 12] developed a Markov chain -based statistical model to 
analyse the performance  of IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA for noisy channel environment and non -
saturation traffic condition whereas Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method used to 
determine the access probabilities of nodes. The error correction capability of different code rates 
is mainly investigated through measuring throughput and access probability of the nodes. In [13], 
a Markov chain -based mathematical model was designed to evaluate the throughput, energy 
consumption and energy efficiency of IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA for ideal channel environment 
and non -saturation traffic condition.  T. Suzuki [ 14] introduced equilibrium point analysis (EPA) 
technique to calculate throughput and average response time of t he IEEE 80 2.15.6 CSMA/CA 
from a  Markov chain -based analytical model which was designed for ideal channel and non -
saturation traffic condition.  However, the authors [ 12], [14]  have n ot considered user priority  
feature to evaluate the performance of CSMA/CA. As per th e IEEE 802.15.6 standard, the 
random -access  mechanism  is used in different contention -based access phases (EAP s, RAP s and 
CAP) under beacon mode with superframes.  However, in [10] – [14], [20] – [22], the authors 
evaluated the performance of CSMA/CA without considering APs duration and superframe 
structure.  Jacob et al. [15] developed a sleep mechanism to extend the network lifetime an d 
designed a user priority wise and Markov chain -based analytical model to measure the 
performance of IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA for ideal channel environment and non -saturation 
traffic conditi on. Khan et al. [16] evaluated normalized throughput and mean frame service time 
of CSMA/CA mechanism by developing a user prio rity wise and  Markov chain -based analytical 
model and assuming that the channel is ideal and nodes contain non -saturated traffic.  Yuan et al.  
[17] analysed  the performance of IEEE 802.15.6 -based WBAN in presence of intra - and inter - 
WBAN interference by designing a  user prio rity wise and Markov chain -based analytical model 
for ideal channel and saturation traffic condition of nodes. The above studies [10] – [12], [14]  – 
[17],  have not considered hidden and exposed terminals that create inter -BAN interference. Use 
of basic access mechanism of CSMA/CA with the presence of hidden and exposed terminals 
cause of more collisions and consequence the degradation the performance of IEEE 802.15.6 
CSMA/CA. The RTS/CTS access mechanism can mitigate the impact of hidden and expos ed 
terminals on CSMA/CA mechanism by reducing collision [24]. As discussed in [23], [25] the 
RTS/ CTS access  mechanism has potentiality to enhance the performance of the IEEE 802.15.6 
CSMA/CA instead of basic access mechanism.  In [18], [19] the authors desi gned a Markov 
Chain -based complete analytical model of IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA by considering most of the 
constrains of IEEE 802.15.6 standard and evaluated the performance parameters viz. normalized 
throughput, successful transmission probability, mean wait ing time and average time between 
two successive access.  
 
3. IEEE 802.15.6  STANDARD  
 
The IEEE 802.15.6 standard defines three physical (PHY) layers, i.e., narrowband (NB), ultra-
wideband  (UWB), and human body communications (HBC) layers. Based on the traffic 
designation, t he IEEE 802.15.6 standard introduces eight user priorities ( 𝑈𝑃𝑖 where 𝑖 𝜖 [0,7]) 
which are differentiated by  𝐶𝑊𝑖,𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝐶𝑊𝑖,𝑚𝑎𝑥. Traffic designation of each 𝑈𝑃𝑖 and the 
relation be tween Contention Window bounds and 𝑈𝑃𝑖 are depicted in Table 1. It defines three International Journal of Wireless & Mobile Networks (IJWMN), Vol.15, No.6, December 2023  
28 access modes: beacon mode with superframes, non -beacon mode with superframes, and non -
beacon mode without superframes. The superframe  of beacon mode  is divided into seven access 
phases, i.e., EAP1 , RAP1 , MAP1 , EAP2 , RAP2 , MAP2 , and CAP , shown in Figure 1. The EAP1 
and EAP2 are used for 𝑈𝑃7, and the RAP1, RAP2 and CAP are used for all UPs. In order to 
access the channel, this standard also defines three access mechanisms:  random access 
mechanism, improvised and  unscheduled access mechanism,  and scheduled access mechanism. 
According to CSMA/CA mechanism of IEEE 802.15.6 standard, a 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node shall maintain a 
backoff counter and contention window ( 𝑊𝑖,𝑗) to get access of the channel. The node shall set its 
backoff counter value to a randomly chosen integer over [ 1,𝑊𝑖,𝑗] and decrease its backoff 
counter by one for each

idle CSMA slot. The node will transmit one frame over the channel if backoff counter reaches 
zero. The contention window selection, locking and unlocking process of the backoff counter 
during the contention period depends on channel and transmission state. A new contention 
window is selected as  
 
 𝑈𝑃𝑖 shall set 𝑊𝑖,𝑗 to 𝐶𝑊𝑖,𝑚𝑖𝑛 for frame successful transmission  or a new frame . 
 If 𝑈𝑃𝑖 failed to transmit , the 𝑊𝑖,𝑗 unchanged if 𝑗 is an odd; otherwise,  𝑊𝑖,𝑗 is doubled.  
 𝑈𝑃𝑖 shall set 𝑊𝑖,𝑗 to 𝐶𝑊𝑖,𝑚𝑎𝑥 if CW exceeds 𝐶𝑊𝑖,𝑚𝑎𝑥 and attempt  do not exceed  retry limits.  
When any of the following events occurs, the node shall lock its backoff counter.  
 The channel is sensed busy due to another transmissions.  
 The current access phase does not permit the 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node for the current transmission attempt.  
 The current time is in the permitted access phase but the time between the end of the CSMA 
slot and the end of the permitted access phase is not long enough for a frame transmission.  
 
The backoff counter will be unlocked when the channel has been idle for SIFS time withi n the 
permitted access phase  and the time interval between the current time and the end of the 
permitted access phase is long enough for a frame transmission. After unlocking the backoff 
counter, the node shall start the backoff procedure and transmit  frame if ba ckoff co unter reaches 
zero. The backoff procedure of IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA mechanism is given in Figure 2.

4. ANALYTICAL MODEL  
 
4.1. System Model  
 
In this paper, we consider a continuous healthcare monitoring system where a patient is equipped 
with one and only one central hub as coordinator and up to 𝑛 (𝑛 = 𝑚𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐵𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒  = 64) 
number of identical medical sensor nodes, deployed on the body , which together forms a one -hop 
star topology of intra -WBAN, shown in Figure  3 . We mainly focus on the uplink frame 
transmission (from node to coordinator). The network consists of all eight UPs traffic ranging 
from 0 to 7, where 0 denotes the lowest pri ority and 7 denotes highest priority traffic. It is also 
considered that each node has a single queue that contains only one user priority data frame. The 
packets arrival process of all UPs is Poisson process with rate λ and this arrival rate is equal for 
all UPs. We assume that the coordinator operates in beacon mode with superframe boundaries 
where MAP1, MAP2, EAP2, RAP2 and CAP are set to zero. It is considered  that all nodes and 
coordinator follow immediate acknowledgement (I -ACK) policy and use automat ic repeat 
request (ARQ) as an error control method. A failure transmission occurs due to two reasons. The 
first reason is collision transmission that happens when more than one node  transmits  at the same 
time and the second one is error transmission that o ccurs due to a noisy channel. A frame is 
dropped when the number of failure transmission exceeds the finite retransmission limits ( 𝑚𝑖+
𝑥𝑖=7). A node that has a data frame to transmit cannot generate a new data frame until either it 
receives the ACK fram e for the data frame or the data frame is dropped.  We also assume that all 
UPs nodes have equal traffic load and payload size and the collision probability of a frame that 
transmitted by a node is independent of the number of retransmissions, i.e., backoff  stages. We 
assume that a node transmits just one data frame after successfully access the channel. We use 
narrowband (NB) as a PHY layer to evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA. In 
this work, we ignore the hidden terminal, expose terminal and  channel capture effect.

4.2. Markov Chain Model  
 
We first design a 2-D Markov chain model to describe the backoff procedure  of IEEE 802.15.6 
CSMA/CA  for both saturation and non -saturation traffic conditions  according to 𝑀/𝐺/1 queuing 
model , which is shown in Figure 4. There are some studies where Markov chain -based analytical 
model was presented to evaluate the performance of CSMA/CA mechanism [9] – [12], [15] – 
[19], [26] – [28], [31 -35]. In this Markov chain, the  state of each node of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 is represented by 
(𝑖,𝑗,𝑘) where 𝑖,𝑗 and 𝑘 denotes  the user priority of node, number of backoff stage  and backoff 
counter value , respectively. The i nitial value of 𝑗 for a new frame is zero and is incremented by 
one after every failure transmission until it reaches the retr y limit (𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖). After every 
successful transmission or frame drop, the value of 𝑗 will be reset to zero. The value of 𝑘 is 
initially set with a value that is random ly chosen from [ 1,𝑊𝑖,𝑗], where 𝑊𝑖,𝑗 denotes the contention 
window size of  𝑈𝑃𝑖 node at backoff stage 𝑗. The backoff coun ter value 𝑘 is decremented by one 
if the channel is sensed idle in a CSMA slot and if there is sufficient time to complete current 
frame transmission before the end of the current access phase. When the counter value becomes 
zero, frame is transmitted  immediately . If failure transmission is occurred due to collision 
transmission or error transmission, the node goes to the next backoff stage with a new backoff 
counter value. If frame is successfully transmitted, the node selects  a new backoff counter value 
under initia l backoff stage  if it has at least one packet for transmission . The contention window 
size of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node at backoff stage 𝑗 is given by

Figure 4. Markov chain for IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  
 
To analy se non -saturation traffic conditions of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node , we introduce a state in the Markov  
chain is denoted by ( 𝑖,𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦 ), which represents the state of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node when the node is empty 
after a successful transmission or a frame drop. We define 𝑏𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 and 𝑏𝑖,𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦  that represent the 
stationary probabilities of states ( 𝑖,𝑗,𝑘) and (𝑖,𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦 ), respectively . We also define  𝜌𝑖 as the 
probability that the queue of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  has at least one frame waiting for transmission. The one -
step transition probabilities between the states of the Markov chain are represented as  
 
{              
 𝑃(𝑖,𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦)|(𝑖,𝑗,𝑘)=(1−𝜌𝑖)𝑃𝑖,𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐 ; 0≤𝑗≤𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖−1

𝑃(𝑖,𝑗,𝑘)|(𝑖,𝑗,𝑘−1)=𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙

We assume that the retr y limit of CSMA/CA mechanism is finite. When number of fai lure 
transmission  of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node exceed the retr y limit (𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖), the frame is dropped and the node 
initiates the backoff procedure again to transmit a new frame. Thus,  the frame drop probability is 
given as  
𝑃𝑖,𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑝=(𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙)𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖+1 (3) 
Now, we derive the stationary probabilities 𝑏𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 and 𝑏𝑖,𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦  in terms of 𝑏𝑖,0,0 state. According 
to the Markov chain,  the s tationary probability of each state  for the zero backoff stage can be 
written as

𝑗=0+𝜌𝑖

𝑊𝑖,0𝑏𝑖,𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦  
By solving all the e quations in Eq.  (4), the general expression of the stationary probabilities for 
zero backoff stage can be written in terms of 𝑏𝑖,0,0 state, i.e.,  
𝑏𝑖,0,𝑘=𝑊𝑖,0−𝑘+1
𝑊𝑖,01
𝑃𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑏𝑖,0,0 ;  𝟏≤𝒌≤𝑾𝒊,𝟎 (5) 
Again, from the Markov chain, the stationary probability of each state for the 𝑗𝑡ℎ backoff stage  
(1≤𝑗≤𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖) can be written as  
{        
 𝑏𝑖,𝑗,𝑊𝑖,𝑗=𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙

33 By solving  all the e quations in Eq.  (6), the general expression of stationary probabilities for 
𝑗𝑡ℎbackoff stage can be written in terms of  𝑏𝑖,0,0 state, i.e.,  
𝑏𝑖,𝑗,𝑘=𝑊𝑖,𝑗−𝑘+1
𝑊𝑖,𝑗𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙
𝑃𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑏𝑖,𝑗−1,0 ; 𝟏≤𝒋≤𝒎𝒊+𝒙𝒊and 𝟏≤𝒌≤𝑾𝒊,𝒋 (7) 
According to the one -step transition probability of the Markov c hain in Eq.  (2), we have  
𝑏𝑖,𝑗,0=𝑃𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑏𝑖,𝑗,1 ; 1≤𝑗≤𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖 (8) 
By adding all the equations in Eq. (6) and Eq.  (8), we have  
𝑏𝑖,𝑗,0=𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑏𝑖,𝑗−1,0 ; 1≤𝑗≤𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖 (9) 
Now we explore the Eq.  (9) for the all values of 𝑗 (1≤𝑗≤𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖) and we have  
{    
 𝑏𝑖,1,0=𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑏𝑖,0,0 
(10) 𝑏𝑖,2,0=𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑏𝑖,1,0 
:  
𝑏𝑖,𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖−1,0=𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑏𝑖,𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖−2,0 
𝑏𝑖,𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖,0=𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑏𝑖,𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖−1,0 
By solvi ng all the equations in Eq.  (10), the last state of each backoff stage can be also written in 
terms of 𝑏𝑖,0,0 state, i.e.,  
𝑏𝑖,𝑗,0=(𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙)𝑗𝑏𝑖,0,0 ; 1≤𝑗≤𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖 (11) 
By substituting Eq. ( 5) and Eq. ( 10) in Eq. ( 7), the general expression of the stationary probability 
for each backoff stage of the Markov chain can be obtained in terms of 𝑏𝑖,0,0 state, i.e.,  
𝑏𝑖,𝑗,𝑘=𝑊𝑖,𝑗−𝑘+1
𝑊𝑖,𝑗(𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙)𝑗

The stationary probability of empty state can be obtained from the Markov chain as

𝑗=0+(1−𝜌𝑖)𝑏𝑖,𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖,0 (13) 
By substituting Eq. (11) in Eq. (12), the stationary probability of empty state can be obtained in 
terms of 𝑏𝑖,0,0 state, i.e.,  
𝑏𝑖,𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦=(1−𝜌𝑖)

𝑘=1𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖
𝑗=1+𝑏𝑖,𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦=1 (15) 
By substituting Eq. ( 11), Eq. ( 12) and Eq. ( 14) in Eq. ( 15), the stationary probability of ( 𝑖,0,0)

According to the CSMA/CA mechanism, a node will attempt for transmission when the node is 
in (𝑖,𝑗,0), 0≤𝑗≤mi+xi, state of the Markov chain. Thus,  the transmission probability of each 
𝑈𝑃𝑖 node is written as  
𝜏𝑖=∑𝑏𝑖,𝑗,0𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖

By substituting Eq. ( 11) in Eq. (1 7), the transmission probability can be obtained in terms of 𝑏𝑖,0,0

34 According to the CSMA/CA mechanism of IEEE 802.15.6 standard, we define 𝑃𝑖,𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘 as the 
probability that in a given CSMA slot if there is not enough time for transmitting a frame in the 
current permitted access period. At this time the backoff counter shall be freeze till the beginning 
of the next permitted access period. Thus, the co unter lock probability is estimated as  
𝑃𝑖,𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘=

where𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑝,𝐿𝑟𝑎𝑝 and 𝐿𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐denote the length of EAP in slots, the length of RAP in slots and the 
duration of successful transmission time in slots, respectively. The mean backoff value of 𝑈𝑃𝑖

The t ransmission probability in a CSMA slot is that  at least one node transmits a frame through 
the channel . Thus, the transmission probability in EAP1 and in RAP1 is denoted  by 𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛,𝑒𝑎𝑝 and 
𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛,𝑟𝑎𝑝, respectively and that are determined as  
{    
 𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛,𝑒𝑎𝑝=1−(1−𝜏7)𝑛7 
(21) 
𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛,𝑟𝑎𝑝=1−∏(1−𝜏𝑖)𝑛𝑖7
𝑖=0 
Where 𝑛𝑖 denotes the number of nodes of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 in the network. We assume that number of nodes 
of each user priority is equal, 𝑛𝑖=𝑛𝑛𝑈𝑃⁄ , where 𝑛 is the total number of nodes in the network 
and 𝑛𝑈𝑃 is the number of user priorities . The idle probability of a CSMA slot is that no node is 
transmit ting in the slot. Thus, we have  
{    
 𝑃𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒,𝑒𝑎𝑝=(1−𝜏7)𝑛7=1−𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛,𝑒𝑎𝑝 
(22) 
𝑃𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒,𝑟𝑎𝑝=∏(1−𝜏𝑖)𝑛𝑖7
𝑖=0=1−𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛,𝑟𝑎𝑝 
The idle probability of a CSMA slot  in a phase  sensed by a 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node is that the medium remains 
idle in a CSMA slot during the backoff procedure of the 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node. Thus we have,  
{    
 𝑃𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒,𝑒𝑎𝑝=(1−𝜏𝑖)𝑛𝑖

(23) 
𝑃𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒,𝑟𝑎𝑝=∏(1−𝜏𝑖)𝑛𝑖 7
𝑖=0
(1−𝜏𝑖) ; 0≤𝑖≤ 7 
Now, w e define 𝑃𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒 as the probability that a CSMA slot is idle sensed by a 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  and the 
node decrements its backoff counter value by one considering counter lock probabilities.  
{ 𝑃𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒=𝑃𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒,𝑟𝑎𝑝(1−𝑃𝑖,𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘) ; 0≤𝑖≤ 6

There is the significant difference between channel access probability and successful transmission 
probability. The channel access probability of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  in an access phase  is the probability that 
the channel is successfully accessed by the 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  during the access phase , conditioned on the 
fact that other nodes are not transmitting. Thus, we have

𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑝+𝐿𝑟𝑎𝑝𝑃𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒,𝑟𝑎𝑝 ; 𝑖=7 
The successful transmission probability of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  in an access phase  is the probability that 
a𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  access the channel successfully and receive ACK from the coordinator  during the 
access phase . Thus, we have  
{ 𝑃𝑖,𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐,𝑟𝑎𝑝= 𝑃𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒,𝑟𝑎𝑝(1−𝑃𝐸𝑅) ; 0≤𝑖≤7 
(27) 
𝑃𝑖,𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐,𝑒𝑎𝑝=𝑃𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒,𝑒𝑎𝑝(1−𝑃𝐸𝑅) ; 𝑖=7 
Finally,  the successful transmission probability  of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  is defined as

𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑝+𝐿𝑟𝑎𝑝𝑃𝑖,𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐,𝑒𝑎𝑝+𝐿𝑟𝑎𝑝
𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑝+𝐿𝑟𝑎𝑝𝑃𝑖,𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐,𝑟𝑎𝑝 ; 𝑖=7 
Where 𝑃𝐸𝑅  indicates the packet error rate whose value depends on access mechanism. We 
assume that immediate acknowledgement (I -ACK) is used in the network and a node transmits 
just one data frame during channel access period and thus, the packet error rate is writt en as  
{ 𝑃𝐸𝑅= 1−(1−𝐵𝐸𝑅)𝐿𝐷𝐴𝑇𝐴+𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾 ; 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑖𝑐  
(29) 
𝑃𝐸𝑅= 1−(1−𝐵𝐸𝑅)𝐿𝑅𝑇𝑆+𝐿𝐶𝑇𝑆+𝐿𝐷𝐴𝑇𝐴+𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾 ; RTS/CTS  
Where 𝐵𝐸𝑅  denotes the bit error rate of the channel and 𝐿𝑅𝑇𝑆, 𝐿𝐶𝑇𝑆, 𝐿𝐷𝐴𝑇𝐴  and 𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾 are the 
lengths of RTS, CTS, DATA and ACK frame in bits. After successfully access the channel, the 
transmission of a node is failed due to two reasons. The first reason is collision in transmission 
and the second one is error in transmission due to noisy  channel. Therefore, the transmission 
failure probability of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node is written as  
𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙=𝑃𝑖,𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑙+𝑃𝑖,𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟  (30) 
Where 𝑃𝑖,𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑙 and 𝑃𝑖,𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟  represent the transmission collision probability and  transmission error 
probability, respectively.  The transmission collision occurs when at least two nodes of an access 
phase transmit frame at the same time over the channel. The transmission collision probability of 
𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  in an access phase  is writte n as 
{    
 𝑃𝑖,𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑙,𝑟𝑎𝑝= 1−𝑛𝑖𝜏𝑖∏(1−𝜏𝑖)𝑛𝑖 7

(1−𝜏𝑖)𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛,𝑒𝑎𝑝 ; 𝑖=7 
Finally,  the transmission collision probability of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  is defined as  
{ 𝑃𝑖,𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑙= 𝑃𝑖,𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑙,𝑟𝑎𝑝 ; 0≤𝑖≤6

𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑝+𝐿𝑟𝑎𝑝𝑃𝑖,𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑙,𝑒𝑎𝑝+𝐿𝑟𝑎𝑝
𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑝+𝐿𝑟𝑎𝑝𝑃𝑖,𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑙,𝑟𝑎𝑝 ; 𝑖=7 
The transmission error occurs when  the channel is accessed successfully as well as the frame is 
transmitted but the frame contains erroneous bit. The transmission error probability is written as  
{ 𝑃𝑖,𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟,𝑟𝑎𝑝= 𝑃𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒,𝑟𝑎𝑝𝑃𝐸𝑅  ; 0≤𝑖≤7 
(33) 
𝑃𝑖,𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟,𝑒𝑎𝑝=𝑃𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒,𝑟𝑎𝑝𝑃𝐸𝑅  ; 𝑖=7 
Finally,  the transmission  error  probability  of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  is defined as  International Journal of Wireless & Mobile Networks (IJWMN), Vol.15, No.6, December 2023

By substituting Eq. (3 2) and Eq. (3 4) in Eq. ( 30), the failure transmission probability can be 
obtained as  
{

 (1−𝑃𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒,𝑟𝑎𝑝(1−𝑃𝐸𝑅)) 
In this work, since we assumed that packet arrival rate of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node is Poisson process with rate 
𝜆𝑖, the probabili ty that  node has at least one packet waiting for transmission can be determined as  
𝜌𝑖=1−𝑒−𝜆𝑖𝑇𝑒,𝑖 (36) 
Where 𝑇𝑒,𝑖 represents the expected time spent by the 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node at each state. The duration of this 
time is not fixed and depends on the channel state, transmission state and access phase. If the 
channel is idle, the duration of the state is one CSMA slot , 𝑇𝑐𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑡 . When the channel is sensed 
as busy its  means that either successful transmission, transmission collision, or error transmission 
is occurred in the channel. If successful transmission is occurred, the duration of the state is the 
time of a successful transmission, which is estimated as

Simplifying all the above derived equations of the proposed analytical model, we obtain 43

𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙, 𝜏𝑖 and 𝜌𝑖. Finally, we solve the simplified equations using Maple [ 30] and then determine 
the performance metrics that are defined in following Section.  
 
5. PERFORMANCE METRICS  
 
5.1. Reliability  
 
The reliability ( 𝑅𝑖) of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node is defined as the complementary probability with which a 
transmitted packet is dropped due to repeated failure transmission after 𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖+1 attempts 
[10]. Therefore, 𝑅𝑖 is mathematically expressed as  
 
𝑅𝑖= 1−𝑃𝑖,𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑝=1−(𝑃𝑖,𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙)𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖+1 (44) 
 
5.2. Normalized Throughput  
 
The normalized throughput  (𝑆𝑖) of 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node is defined as  the ratio of the time that the 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  
uses for successful transmission of data frame at a state and the time the 𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  stays at that 
state [ 18].Therefore, 𝑆𝑖 is mathematically expressed as  
 
{ 𝑆𝑖=𝑃𝑖,𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛,𝑟𝑎𝑝𝑋𝑟𝑎𝑝𝐿𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦

𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑝+𝐿𝑟𝑎𝑝 ; 𝑖=7 
Where 𝐿𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦  is the  size of  payload/frame  body size in slots, 𝑋𝑟𝑎𝑝 represents the average 
number of slots during RAP and 𝑋𝑒𝑎𝑝indicates the average  number of slots during EAP . 𝑋𝑒𝑎𝑝 and 
𝑋𝑟𝑎𝑝 are approximated as  
𝑋𝑒𝑎𝑝= 𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑝
𝐿𝑒,𝑒𝑎𝑝 and 𝑋𝑟𝑎𝑝= 𝐿𝑟𝑎𝑝
𝐿𝑒,𝑟𝑎𝑝 (46) 
 
5.3. Energy Consumption  
 
The energy consumption of a node is affected by several stages: 1) idle stage, 2) successful stage,  
3) collision stage and  4) error stage  [10],[13],[21],[22] . Assume that 𝑃𝑇𝑋, 𝑃𝑅𝑋 and 𝑃𝐼𝐷𝐿𝐸 denote 
the energy consumption in transmitting state, r eceiving state and idle state of a node, respectively. 
The mean energy consumption ( 𝐸𝑖) of  𝑈𝑃𝑖 node is expressed as   
 
𝐸𝑖=𝐸𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒+𝐸𝑖,𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐+𝐸𝑖,𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑙+𝐸𝑖,𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟  (47) 
where 𝐸𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒, 𝐸𝑖,𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐, 𝐸𝑖,𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑙 and 𝐸𝑖,𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟  are the energy consumption during idle stage, successful 
stage, collision stage, and error stage, respectively.  
𝐸𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒=𝑇𝑐𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑡𝑃𝐼𝐷𝐿𝐸𝑃𝑖,𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒 (48) 
The Equation  (49) and (50) present the energy consumption during different stages for basic and 
RTS/CTS access mechanisms, respectively.

5.4. Average Access Delay  
 
The average access delay of  𝑈𝑃𝑖 node  is defined as the average time from the instant when frame 
is generated to the instant when the packet is successfully transmitted or dropped. The average 
access delay has two parts 1) waiting time for permitted access phase  2) channel access time to 
transmit frame  [29].The waiting time is calculated as follows:  
𝑇𝑤𝑎𝑖𝑡=𝑇𝑒𝑎𝑝
2 (51) 
The s uccessful transmission is occurred at state ( 𝑖,𝑗,0) if a collision occurs at each state ( 𝑖,𝑙,0), 
1≤𝑙≤𝑗−1, and no collision occurs at state ( 𝑖,𝑗,0). Packet drop is occurred if a collision 
occurs at each state ( 𝑖,𝑚𝑖+𝑥𝑖,0). Thus  the average access delay of  𝑈𝑃𝑖 node can be determined 
as 
{

6. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION  
 
We consider a general experimental scenario of intra -WBAN to investigate the effects of packet 
arrival rate, channel condition , payload size, access phase length , access mechanism  and number 
of nodes on performance metrics of IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA MAC protocol. We assume that  
the length of  MAP1, EAP2, RAP2, MAP2 and CAP  of the superframe  are set to zero. The 
general parameters of the intra -WBAN are given in Table  4.

6.1. Effects of Arrival Rate 
 
In order to investigate the effects of arrival rate on the performance metrics, we consider a 
network scenario that operates with RTS/CTS access mechanism, non -saturation traffic condition  
of nodes  and noisy channel (𝐵𝐸𝑅= 2 ×10−5). The network scenario consists of 16 nodes 
where each user priorities contain 2 nodes. We set the payload size as 𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦 =100 𝑏𝑦𝑡𝑒𝑠  
and access phase lengths as 𝑒𝑎𝑝1 = 0.1  𝑠𝑒𝑐 and 𝑟𝑎𝑝1 = 0.8  𝑠𝑒𝑐 while other parameters are 
same as general scenario. We assume that all user priorities have same packet arrival rate, i.e., 
𝜆0=𝜆1=⋯=𝜆7. The effects of arrival rate  vary from 0.5 𝑝𝑘𝑡𝑠/𝑠𝑒𝑐 to 4.0 𝑝𝑘𝑡𝑠/𝑠𝑒𝑐 , on the 
performance metrics viz. reliability, normalized through put, energy consumption and average 
access delay, are illustrated in Figure  5. International Journal of Wireless & Mobile Networks (IJWMN), Vol.15, No.6, December 2023  
40  
 
Figure 5.   Effects of packet arrival r ate on the per formance metrics  
 
The results in Figure  5 (a) and (b) show that as the packet arrival rate increases, the reliability and  
normalized throughput of lower user priorities (UP 0 –UP 6) decrease whereas the reliability and 
normalized throughput of highest user priorities (UP 7) increases. This is because the collision 
probability increases with the packet arrival rate increasing. I t is also observed that energy 
consumption and average access delay exponentially increase with the packet  arrival rate 
increasing in Figure  5 (c) and  (d). This is due to the fact that the collision probability increases as 
the packet arrival rate increase s. 
 
6.2. Effects of Channel Condition  
 
In order to investigate the effects of channel conditions on the performance metrics, we consider 
a network scenario that operates with RTS/CTS access mechanism and saturation traffic 
condition. The channel condition is ex pressed b y the value of bit error rate ( 𝐵𝐸𝑅 ) where 𝐵𝐸𝑅  =
 0 represents  the ideal channel and 𝐵𝐸𝑅 > 0 represents the noisy channel. The network scenario 
consists of 16 nodes where each user priorities contain 2 nod es. We set the payload size as 
𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦  = 100  𝑏𝑦𝑡𝑒𝑠  and access phase length  as 𝑒𝑎𝑝1 = 0.1  𝑠𝑒𝑐 and 𝑟𝑎𝑝1 = 0.8 𝑠𝑒𝑐 
while other parameter s are same as general scenario.  The effects of channel condition (BER), 
varies from 0 – 0.01 , on the performance metrics vi z. reliability, normalized throughput, energy 
consumption and average access delay, are illustrated in Figure 6. 
International Journal of Wireless & Mobile Networks (IJWMN), Vol.15, No.6, December 2023  
41  
 
Figure 6. Effects of channel condition on the  performance metrics  
 
The results show that the reliability, normalized throughput and energy consumption of all UPs 
are maximum whereas the average access delay is minimum for the ideal ( 𝐵𝐸𝑅=0) channel 
condition. This is because the collision probability is almost constant for fixed number of nodes 
in the network and there is no failure transmi ssion occurred due to transmission error. With the 
bit error rate increasing, it would cause many error transmissions, which resulting in a significant 
decrease in the reliability, normalized throughput and energy consumption as well as a slight 
increase i n the average access delay. It is also observed that the performance metrics is almost 
stable up to 𝐵𝐸𝑅=2×10−4 whereas with the bit error rate further increasing, the performance 
drastically degrades.  
 
6.3. Effects of Payload Size  
 
In order to inves tigate t he effects of payload (𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦 ) size on the performance metrics, we 
consider a network scenario that operates with RTS/CTS access mechanism and saturation traffic 
condition. The network scenario consists of 16 nodes where each user priorities co ntain 2 nodes . 
We set the bit error rate as 𝐵𝐸𝑅= 2 ×10−5 and access phase lengths as 𝑒𝑎𝑝1 = 0.1  𝑠𝑒𝑐 and 
𝑟𝑎𝑝1 = 0.8 𝑠𝑒𝑐 while other parameters are same as general scenario.  The effect s of payload 
size, varies from 0−260 𝑏𝑦𝑡𝑒𝑠 , on the pe rformance metrics viz. reliability, normalized 
throughput, energy consumption and average access delay, are illustrated in Fig ure 7 . The results 
in Fig ure 7 (a) and  (d) show that payload size has no significant impact on reliability and access 
delay, respectively. This is because the collision probability is almost constant for fixed number 
of nodes in the network. It is also observed that the normalized throughput a nd energy 
consumption sharply increases as the frame payload size increases and highest user priority 
increases faster th an other user priorities in Figure 7 (b) and  (c). This is due to the fact that 
number of successfully transmitted bits increases as the  payload size increases where the collision 
probability is almost constant and thus increase of energy consumption. The highest user nodes 
achieve more throughput and consume more power than others because UP 7 has transmission 
opportunities in both access phases (EAP1 and RAP1) with the lowest contention window bound.

6.4. Effects of Access Phase Length  
 
In order to investigate the effects of access phase length on the performance metrics, we consider 
a network scenario that operates with RTS/CTS access mechanism, non -saturation traffi c 
condition and noisy channel ( 𝐵𝐸𝑅= 2 ×10−5). The network scenario consists of 16 nodes 
where each user priorities contain 2 nod es. We set the payload size as 𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦  =
  100 𝑏𝑦𝑡𝑒𝑠  and exc lusive access phase length as 𝑒𝑎𝑝1 = 0.1  𝑠𝑒𝑐 while other parameters are 
same as general scenario. We assume that the packet arrival rate of each user priorities is equal, 
i.e, 𝜆0=𝜆1=⋯=𝜆7=2.0 𝑝𝑘𝑡𝑠/𝑠𝑒𝑐. We  vary the length of RAP 1 from 0.1  𝑠𝑒𝑐− 0.8 𝑠𝑒𝑐 
because all user priorities nodes can access the channel during the random  access  phase (RAP) 
only. The effects of access phase length (RAP1) on the performance metrics viz. reliability, 
normali zed throughput, energy consumption and average access delay, are illustrated in Fig ure 8 . 
The results in Fig ure 8 (b) and  (c) show that equal length of EAP1 and RAP1 (eap1=rap1=0.1 
sec) gives an aggressive prioritization in UP 7 over the other UPs. As the length of RAP1 
increases, the difference in normalized throughput and energy consumption between UP 7 and 
other lower user priorities decreases. It is also noted that the normalized throughput and energy 
consumption of UP 7 expone ntially decrease whereas the normalized throughput and energy 
consumption of other user priorities gradually increase. With the length of RAP1 increasing, the 
reliability gradually decreases while the average access delay grad ually increases as shown in 
Figure8 (a) and  (d).

6.5. Effects of Access Mechanism  and Number of Nodes  
 
In order to investigate the effects of access mechanism and number of nodes on the performance 
metrics, we consider a network scenario that operates with non -saturation traffic condition and 
noisy channel ( 𝐵𝐸𝑅= 2 ×10−5). We set the payload size as 𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦  = 100  𝑏𝑦𝑡𝑒𝑠  and 
access phase lengths as 𝑒𝑎𝑝1 = 0.1 𝑠𝑒𝑐 and 𝑟𝑎𝑝1 = 0.8 𝑠𝑒𝑐 while other parameters are same 
as general scenario. We also assume that all user priorities have same packet arrival rate, i.e., 
𝜆0=𝜆1=⋯=𝜆7=0.5 𝑝𝑘𝑡𝑠/𝑠𝑒𝑐. The effects of access mechanism  (basic and RTS/CTS) and 
number of nodes, varies from 8−64, on the performance metrics viz. reliability, normalized 
throughput, energy consumption and average access delay, are illustrated in Fig ure 9 – 12. The 
results show that the reliability, normalized throughput, energy consumption and average access 
delay of t he lower user priorities (UP 0 - UP 6) nodes are almost the same up to 24 and 32 nodes for 
the basic access mechanism and RTS/CTS access mechanism, respectively. It is also observed 
that as the number of nodes further increases, the reliability and normalize d throughput sharply 
decrease whereas energy consumption and average access delay exponentially increase. This 
increasing rate or decreasing rate of performance metrics of basic access mechanism is more than 
the RTS/CTS access mechanism. This is because th e collision probability increases slowly with 
the number of nodes increasing within a certain range (24 for the basic access mechanism and 32 
for the RTS/CTS access mechanism) whereas with the number of vehicles further increasing, the 
collision probabilit y increases dramatically. Moreover, the increasing rate of collision probability 
of the basic access mechanism is more than the RTS/CTS access mechanism. The results also 
show that the highest user priority (UP 7) nodes gain the highest reliability (almost 80%), achieve 
the highest normalized throughput (on average 0.8%), consume the lowest energy (on average 5 
µJ) and enjoy the lowest (almost zero) average access delay compared to the lower user priorities 
(UP 0 - UP 6) nodes. This is because UP 7 nodes are as signed an aggressive prioritization over the 
other UPs by providing transmission opportunities in both access phases (EAP1 and RAP1) with 
the lowest contention window bound. It is also shown that the RTS/CTS access mechanism 
improves the performance of UP 7 nodes in all aspects compared to the basic access mechanism.

45 7. CONCLUSION  
 
In this paper, we developed a Markov chain -based analytical model of  IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA  
and solved the  complex analytical model by Maple to investigate the effects of the packet arrival 
rate, channel condition, payload size, access phase length, access mechanism and number of 
nodes on the performance parameters viz. rel iability, normalized throughput, energy consumption 
and average access delay.  The analytical results clearly indicated that  different MAC and PHY 
parameters  have significant impact on the performance of IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA.  Finally,  we 
concluded  the necessity  of different access phases, access mechanisms  and user priorities in IEEE 
802.15.6 standard . We believe that the evaluated results would assist the communication protocol 
developers to design  different algorithms  and to select optimal value of di fferent MAC and PHY 
parameters based on  desired QoS.
