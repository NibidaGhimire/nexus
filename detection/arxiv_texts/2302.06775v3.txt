Conformal Loxodromes
Michael Eastwood
Abstract In conformal differential geometry, there are some distinguished curves,
often known as ‘conformal circles,’ since, on the round sphere, they are the round
circles (and these are conformally invariant). But on the two-sphere, the curves of
constant compass bearing are also conformally invariant. These ‘loxodromes’ admit
a curved analogue in the realm of M ¨obius geometry. In this article, these curved
analogues are explained and the fifth order invariant ODE that they satisfy is derived.

1 Introduction
This article is concerned with conformal geometry in dimension 𝑛≥3 and M¨obius
geometry in dimension 2. These are parabolic geometries [6] and, more precisely,
this article is concerned with the distinguished curves of a parabolic geometry in
the particular cases of conformal and M ¨obius geometry. In conformal geometry,
one particular type of such distinguished curves is due to Yano [17], and these
are nowadays well-known as conformal geodesics [16] or conformal circles [1].
Indeed, they are so well-known that one might be tempted to suppose that there are
no other options for conformally distinguished curves. I would like to thank Omid
Makhmali for asking a question concerning distinguished curves in conformal and
CR geometry, which I started to answer by asserting that Yano’s conformal circles are

the only option. But this is not true and the main purpose of this article is to explain
another possibility, namely the conformal loxodromes of the title. In two dimensions,
i.e. for M ¨obius geometry, these extra curves, together with conformal circles, cover
all possibilities. Conformal loxodromes also provide a nice complementary notion to
that of conformal circles: whereas it has recently been shown by Cameron, Dunajski,
and Tod [5] that conformal circles cannot spiral (i.e. they cannot enter and remain in
every neighbourhood of a point without passing through the point itself), conformal
loxodromes on the sphere always spiral.
The final version of this article has benefitted greatly from feedback provided by
Maciej Dunajski, Josef ˇSilhan, Lenka Zalabov ´a, and Vojt ˇechˇZ´adn´ık. I would also
like to thank an anonymous referee for many valuable suggestions.
2 Conformal circles
In this section, we shall review a particular construction of conformal circles. There
are, in fact, many constructions [1, 6, 9, 11, 16, 17] but the route we describe here
is due to Doubrov and ˇZ´adn´ık [7] in general parabolic geometry and implemented
in [10] for the case of conformal geometry, ending up with the equations of Tod [16]
forunparameterised conformal circles. Here one may encounter a red herring since
conformal circles are naturally equipped with preferred parameterisations defined up
toprojective freedom (as in [6, 11], for example). Indeed, anycurve in a conformal
manifold is equipped with such preferred parameterisations, just as any curve in a
Riemannian manifold, geodesic or not, may be equipped with preferred arc-length
parameterisations. In [1], the equations of conformal circles are broken into two sets,
one of which controls where they go whilst the other controls the parameterisations.
Our viewpoint in this article follows Tod [16], who writes the equations in terms
of a chosen background metric , as follows. Let 𝑔𝑎𝑏denote the background metric on
our smooth manifold 𝑀and∇𝑎the associated Levi-Civita connection. For 𝛾↩→𝑀a
smooth oriented curve, let 𝑈𝑎denote the unit tangent vector along 𝛾in the direction
of the orientation and let 𝜕≡𝑈𝑎∇𝑎denote the directional derivative along𝛾.
This differential operator is well-defined on any tensor field defined along 𝛾and, in
particular, we may define the acceleration field along𝛾by
𝐴𝑎≡𝜕𝑈𝑎,where𝑈𝑎≡𝑔𝑎𝑏𝑈𝑏.
As usual, the curve 𝛾is ageodesic if and only if the acceleration 𝐴𝑎vanishes. This
notion is not conformally invariant. Specifically, if 𝑔𝑎𝑏is replaced by a conformally
equivalent metricb𝑔𝑎𝑏=Ω2𝑔𝑎𝑏, for some smooth function Ω>0, then
b𝐴𝑎=𝐴𝑎−Υ𝑎+𝑈𝑏Υ𝑏𝑈𝑎,whereΥ𝑎≡Ω−1∇𝑎Ω. (1)
But, following Tod [16], if we introduce the normalised jerk
𝐽𝑎≡𝜕𝐴𝑎+(𝐴𝑏𝐴𝑏+P𝑏𝑐𝑈𝑏𝑈𝑐)𝑈𝑎−P𝑎𝑏𝑈𝑏, (2)Conformal Loxodromes 3
where P 𝑎𝑏is the Schouten tensor
P𝑎𝑏≡1
𝑛−2(𝑅𝑎𝑏−1
2(𝑛−1)𝑅𝑔𝑎𝑏), (3)
then it turns out that
b𝐽𝑎=Ω−1𝐽𝑎 (4)
and so
𝜕𝐴𝑎=P𝑎𝑏𝑈𝑏−(𝐴𝑏𝐴𝑏+P𝑏𝑐𝑈𝑏𝑈𝑐)𝑈𝑎 (5)
is a conformally invariant third order ODE, which defines unparameterised curves
known as conformal circles .
Notice that in this exposition we have implicitly supposed that 𝑛≥3, in order to
define the Schouten tensor (3), whose key feature is that
bP𝑎𝑏=P𝑎𝑏−∇𝑎Υ𝑏+Υ𝑎Υ𝑏−1
2Υ𝑐Υ𝑐𝑔𝑎𝑏. (6)
In two dimensions, we may simply assert that P 𝑎𝑏is to be part of the structure,
associated with any choice of metric and, if b𝑔𝑎𝑏= Ω2𝑔𝑎𝑏, then this Rho-tensor is
decreed to transform according to (6). This is a M¨obius structure in the sense of
Calderbank [3] and conformal circles are defined for such structures by exactly the
same equation (5).
It takes some calculation to verify (4) and it is preferable to set things up so
that this remarkable transformation law is automatic. In [10], this was accomplished
by unpacking the Cartan connection formulation of unparameterised distinguished
curves in parabolic geometry, due to Doubrov- ˇZ´adn´ık [7]. Even so, this was done
indirectly (by using the standard tractor connection ). Here, we take the opportunity
to do so more directly, by using the adjoint tractor connection , defined as follows.
Firstly, we need to define the adjoint tractor bundle and, for this, we shall need the
notion of conformally weighted densities and tensors. In the presence of a metric 𝑔𝑎𝑏,
a conformal density 𝜎of weight𝑤is simply a smooth function 𝜎𝑔but if𝑔𝑎𝑏is
replaced by a conformally equivalent metric b𝑔𝑎𝑏= Ω2𝑔𝑎𝑏, then we are obliged to
replace the corresponding smooth function by 𝜎b𝑔=Ω𝑤𝜎𝑔. We may view conformal
densities of weight 𝑤as sections of a smooth line bundle ∧0[𝑤]and observe that,
if𝑀is oriented, then this notion is tied to the bundle of 𝑛-forms via a canonical
identification ∧𝑛=∧0[−𝑛](see [2] for details). Conformally weighted tensors
are defined similarly: for example, the bundle of conformally weighted 1-forms of
weight 2 is ∧1[2]≡∧1⊗∧0[2], the conformal metric is, tautologically, a section of
the bundleÇ2∧1[2], and raising and lowering indices using the conformal metric
gives a tautological identification 𝑇𝑀=∧1[2](again, see [2] for details). Notice
that we may better regard the normalised jerk (2) as a 1-form of weight −1 and then
(4) simply says that 𝐽𝑎is conformally invariant.
In the presence of a metric 𝑔𝑎𝑏, the adjoint tractor bundle Ais defined to be a
direct sum of four individual tensor bundles, namely4 Michael Eastwood
A ≡𝑇𝑀
∧2[2]∧0
∧1=∧1[2]
∧2[2]∧0

but if we conformally rescale the metric b𝑔𝑎𝑏=Ω2𝑔𝑎𝑏, then sections ofAare obliged
to transform as

𝜌𝑏+Υ𝑎𝜇𝑎𝑏−Υ𝑏𝜈−Υ𝑎Υ𝑏𝜎𝑎+1
2Υ𝑎Υ𝑎𝜎𝑏, (7)
whereΥ𝑎≡Ω−1∇𝑎Ω. It is easy to check that the bundle Ais well-defined. Notice
from (7) thatAis equipped with a canonical surjection A →𝑇𝑀 (indeed, we
may regardAas a canonically defined subbundle of the jet-bundle 𝐽2𝑇𝑀). This
is a feature common to all adjoint tractor bundles in parabolic geometry (see [6]
for details). In generality, adjoint tractor bundles come equipped with invariantly
defined connections and, as one might expect, in conformal geometry the adjoint
tractor connection∇𝑎:A→∧1⊗A may be written in terms of a chosen metric
in the conformal class and its associated Levi-Civita connection. The formula is

∇𝑎𝜌𝑏−P𝑎𝑐𝜇𝑏𝑐−P𝑎𝑏𝜈.
In any case, from (6) and (7) it is straightforward to verify that this formula gives an
invariantly defined connection. In particular, for any given curve 𝛾 ↩→𝑀we may
use the adjoint tractor connection to define an invariant directional derivative
𝜕≡𝑈𝑎∇𝑎:A|𝛾→A[− 1]|𝛾,
the conformal weight arising because if we replace the metric 𝑔𝑎𝑏byb𝑔𝑎𝑏=Ω2𝑔𝑎𝑏,
then we must replace 𝑈𝑎byb𝑈𝑎=Ω−1𝑈𝑎. For a chosen metric 𝑔𝑎𝑏in the conformal
class, let us record the formula for this invariantly defined directional derivative:

bundleBin Proposition 1 by

This bundle has the advantage of being manifestly conformally invariant and,
when𝐽𝑎≡0, it is clear from (9) that it coincides with B. Furthermore, together with
the observation that 𝑈𝑎𝐽𝑎=0, we may deduce from (9) and (10) that

Therefore, span Φ,𝜕Φ,𝜕2Φ⊂A| 𝛾is preserved by 𝜕if and only if 𝐽𝑎≡0, as stated
by the referee, who also points out that this conclusion resembles the corresponding
characterisation of unparameterised conformal circles given in [14, Proposition 3.3],
namely that a certain rank 3 subbundle ⟨𝑇,𝑇′,𝑇′′⟩of the standard tractor bundle is
parallel along 𝛾. The advantage ofB, however, is that it depends one fewer jets of 𝛾
than does span Φ,𝜕Φ,𝜕2Φand it is a subbundle of the symmetry bundle derived
from circles in the flat model, as discussed in the remainder of this section. For more
on the characterisation of conformal circles via standard tractors, see [12].
Theorem 1 shows that the condition 𝐽𝑏≡0 is conformally invariant. To relate this
characterisation to the general criterion of [7], we need to enlarge the subbundle B
by means of a complementary subbundle:

Theorem 2 The subbundleS≡B⊕C⊂A 𝛾is preserved by 𝜕if and only if 𝐽𝑎≡0.
As detailed in [10], the advantage of Theorem 2 is that the subbundle Shas a
geometric interpretation, roughly as follows. Firstly, as its name suggests, the adjoint
tractor bundle is modelled on the adjoint representation 𝔰𝔬(𝑛+1,1)of SO↑(𝑛+1,1),
more precisely on the homogeneous vector bundle
SO↑(𝑛+1,1)×𝑃𝔰𝔬(𝑛+1,1)
↓
SO↑(𝑛+1,1)/𝑃=𝑆𝑛,
where SO↑(𝑛+1,1)is the connected component of the identity of SO (𝑛+1,1)acting
on𝑆𝑛by conformal transformations with 𝑃as stabiliser subgroup. The adjoint tractor
connection is modelled on the flat connection on this homogeneous bundle induced
by the Maurer-Cartan form (see, e.g. [6]). The Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(𝑛+1,1)may be
realised as the space of conformal Killing fields on the round 𝑛-sphere𝑆𝑛and,
as such, comes equipped with a family of Lie subalgebras, namely the symmetry
algebras of the family of round circles 𝑆1↩→𝑆𝑛. As detailed in [10], these symmetry
algebras have dimension
3+(𝑛−1)(𝑛−2)
2=dimB+dimC
and, indeed, the subbundle S ⊂A|𝛾is modelled on this family of subalgebras.
See [10] for a precise unpacking of the formulation of unparameterised distinguished
curves in parabolic geometry due to Doubrov- ˇZ´adn´ık [7] in terms of the adjoint
tractor bundle, arriving at Theorem 2 above for conformal geometry.
In 2 dimensions, the formulation is exactly the same, if not simpler, since here
we may identify 𝑆2as the Riemann sphere CP1, with SL(2,C)acting by M ¨obius
transformations. In 2 dimensions C=0 soS=Bhas rank 3. We may take
RP1↩→CP1as a typical circle in the round 2-sphere. It is the unique closed orbit
of SL(2,R)and the moduli space of all circles may therefore be identified with
SL(2,C)/SL(2,R). The fibres ofBare conjugate to 𝔰𝔩(2,R)⊂𝔰𝔩(2,C).
3 Loxodromes
It is well-known that conformal transformations of the round 𝑛-sphere preserve the
round circles. Moreover, each such circle is homogeneous , i.e. there is a subgroup8 Michael Eastwood
of the conformal transformations that acts transitively on the circle. This property
can be stated infinitesimally in terms of the Lie algebra of conformal Killing fields,
specifically that the ‘symmetry algebra’ of any fixed circle be non-zero (see [7, 10]
for details). This is especially congenial when 𝑛=2, since we may employ complex
numbers as follows. On an affine chart C↩→CP1, the conformal Killing fields are

(16)
and under the Mercator projection 𝜁=𝑒2𝜋𝑖(𝑢−𝑖𝑣)becomes the curve 𝑣=𝛽𝑢of
constant bearing 𝛽, known in navigation as a Rhumb line orloxodrome . Setting
𝛽=0 in (16) gives a circle as does letting 𝛽↑∞. In the Mercator projection these
circles are the equator or prime meridian, respectively. Otherwise, it is clear that 𝛽
is a conformal invariant. Just like household screws, loxodromes come in two types:
right-handed 𝛽>0
left-handed
𝛽<0
and henceforth we shall concentrate on right-handed loxodromes , in which case we
can extract the conformal invariant 𝛽from the discriminant of its generator (15).
Specifically

which, up to real scale, yields
𝛽2−1
𝛽=𝛽−1
𝛽, (17)
which, in turn, precisely determines the bearing 𝛽 > 0. In fact, up to scale, there
are no other conformal symmetries of the loxodrome (13). One can check this by
calculation (following [10, §2], for example) but also by counting degrees of freedom
as follows. For fixed bearing 𝛽, the formula (13) gives a loxodrome with the origin
as a marked point. Counting 2 dimensions for each of 𝑝and𝑞together with an
additional 2 dimensions for an arbitrary translation therefore gives a 6-dimensional
space of marked right-handed loxodromes with bearing 𝛽. Erasing the mark gives a
5-dimensional moduli space of right-handed loxodromes with bearing 𝛽. This moduli
space is homogeneous under the 6-dimensional symmetry group SL (2,C)and so
the stabiliser subgroup of any particular loxodrome must be just 1-dimensional.10 Michael Eastwood
Theorem 3 ( Cf.§3.2.1 of [15]) On the round two-sphere, the following list consti-
tutes a classification of the conformally homogeneous unparameterised curves:
•the round circles,
•the right-handed loxodromes with bearing 𝛽>0,
•the left-handed loxodromes with bearing 𝛽<0.
Proof On the round two-sphere, conformally identified as the Riemann sphere CP1,
the conformal Killing fields are the same as the global holomorphic vector fields,
which in turn may be realised as the space of binary quadrics
Γ(CP1,Θ)Γ(CP1,O(2))Ç2C2,
as in (11). Without loss of generality, we may always suppose that such a quadric
has a zero at∞∈CP1, equivalently that 𝑎=0 in the field 𝑍from (11). Then, by
translation, we may suppose that
𝑍=𝑐𝜕
𝜕𝑧or𝑍=𝑏𝑧𝜕
𝜕𝑧
according to whether 𝑍has a double zero at ∞∈CP1or not. Looking at (12), we
now see that, in the first case, we encounter only translations whose flows are straight
lines in the affine chart C↩→CP1and, therefore, circles on CP1. In the second case

whose flows are logarithmic spirals (16) if both 𝜆and𝐹are non-zero. Otherwise
the non-trivial flows are circles centred on the origin, if 𝜆=0, or rays through the
origin, if𝐹=0. □
The four main compass directions, north, south, east, and west are called the
cardinal directions. The intermediate directions such as north-west are known as
ordinal and it is clear from (17) that loxodromes with ordinal bearings are generated
precisely by holomorphic fields 𝑍with purely imaginary discriminant.
4 Conformal loxodromes
Perhaps these should more accurately be called M¨obius loxodromes . They are the
distinguished unparameterised curves in 2-dimensional M ¨obius geometry that are
modelled on loxodromes, just as conformal circles are modelled on round circles.
Recall that conformal circles are controlled by (5), an invariant third order ODE. We
shall find that conformal loxodromes are controlled by an invariant fifth order ODE,
which we may derive as follows.Conformal Loxodromes 11
In fact, for simplicity, we shall just derive the equation for ordinal loxodromes.
To do this, we firstly need to write the discriminant in terms of adjoint tractors.

Proof In flat space with co ¨ordinates(𝑥1,𝑥2)=(𝑥,𝑦), the general conformal Killing
field (12) corresponds to the following section of the adjoint tractor bundle
𝜎1=𝑢+𝜆𝑥−𝐹𝑦+1
2𝑃(𝑥2−𝑦2)−𝑄𝑥𝑦
𝜎2=𝑣+𝜆𝑦+𝐹𝑥+𝑃𝑥𝑦+1
2𝑄(𝑥2−𝑦2)
𝜇12=𝐹+𝑃𝑦+𝑄𝑥 𝜈=𝜆+𝑃𝑥−𝑄𝑦
𝜌1=−𝑃 𝜌 2=𝑄,
which is easily checked to be parallel for the adjoint tractor connection. (In other
words, this section of Ais the result of applying the usual BGG splitting operator [13]
to the conformal Killing field 𝑋in (12).) For this section, a computation yields
2(4𝜎𝑏𝜌𝑏−𝜇𝑏𝑐𝜇𝑏𝑐+2𝜈2)=4(𝜆2−𝐹2−2𝑃𝑢+2𝑄𝑣)
4𝜖𝑏𝑐(2𝜎[𝑏𝜌𝑐]−𝜈𝜇𝑏𝑐)=8(𝑄𝑢+𝑃𝑣−𝜆𝐹),
where we have chosen to normalise 𝜖𝑏𝑐such that𝜖12=1. But, with the conventions
leading up to (12), it is easily checked that
𝑏2−4𝑎𝑐=4
(𝜆2−𝐹2−2𝑃𝑢+2𝑄𝑣)+2𝑖(𝜆𝐹−𝑄𝑢−𝑃𝑣)
,
as advertised. □
In arbitrary dimensions, it is interesting to note that
4𝜎𝑏𝜌𝑏−𝜇𝑏𝑐𝜇𝑏𝑐+2𝜈2and 2𝜎[𝑏𝜌𝑐]−𝜈𝜇𝑏𝑐
are invariants of adjoint tractors (with values in ∧0and∧2[2], respectively). In two
dimensions, Lemma 1 implies that ordinal loxodromes in flat space are generated by
parallel adjoint tractors with 4 𝜎𝑏𝜌𝑏−𝜇𝑏𝑐𝜇𝑏𝑐+2𝜈2=0. The tractor interpretation
of the Doubrov- ˇZ´adn´ık formulation [7] of unparameterised distinguished curves
modelled on ordinal loxodromes in M ¨obius geometry hence requires that we find a

by (18) and from the invariance (4) of 𝐽𝑏and the formula (1) for b𝐴𝑎it follows that
b𝜅=𝜅+𝑈𝑎Υ𝑎. (21)
This is part of what needs to be shown (7) in order to verify that (19) be invariantly
defined. The remaining verifications are straightforward though tedious. Finally, a
simple calculation checks that (20) holds. □
In fact, any coefficient in front of 𝐽𝑏on the last line of (19) will give an equally good
invariant lift of 𝑈𝑏toA[− 1]but the following simple formula depends crucially on
that coefficient being 1.

We may formalise the conclusion of this theorem as follows.
Definition 1 Anordinal conformal loxodrome is a smooth curve 𝛾 ↩→𝑀along
which𝐽𝑏≠0 and (22) holds, where 𝜅is defined by (18).
We remark that (22) is M ¨obius invariant by construction but, of course, this can
be verified directly as follows:
•the density𝜅has weight−1 andb𝜅=𝜅+𝑈𝑎Υ𝑎so
b𝜕b𝜅=𝜕(𝜅+𝑈𝑎Υ𝑎)−𝑈𝑏Υ𝑏(𝜅+𝑈𝑎Υ𝑎)

•from (1) we find
b𝐴𝑎b𝐴𝑎=𝐴𝑎𝐴𝑎+Υ𝑎Υ𝑎−(𝑈𝑎Υ𝑎)2−2𝐴𝑎Υ𝑎,
•from (21) we find
b𝜅2=𝜅2+2𝑈𝑎Υ𝑎𝜅+(𝑈𝑎Υ𝑎)2,
•from (6) we find
𝑈𝑎𝑈𝑏bP𝑎𝑏=𝑈𝑎𝑈𝑏P𝑎𝑏−𝑈𝑎𝜕Υ𝑎+(𝑈𝑎Υ𝑎)2−1
2Υ𝑎Υ𝑎,
and, since all correction terms cancel, it follows that 𝜕𝜅+1
2(𝐴𝑎𝐴𝑎+𝜅2)+𝑈𝑎𝑈𝑏P𝑎𝑏
is an invariant density of weight −2. Of course, this construction is all under the
assumption that 𝐽𝑎≠0, which means that we are avoiding curves that, at some point,
osculate a conformal circle to third order.
5 A fourth order ODE
At this point, one may smell something fishy since, in [9], Dunajski and Kry ´nski
manufacture a fourth order conformally invariant ODE [9, Equation (4.14)] that, in
flat two dimensions, simultaneously controls the conformal circles and loxodromes
whereas (22) is fifthorder and controls just the ordinal loxodromes. This smell comes
from the red herring mentioned early in §2 regarding whether we are considering
parameterised orunparameterised curves. In [9], curves 𝛾↩→𝑀are equipped with
a parameterisation 𝑡:𝛾→R, which one may use to normalise various quantities as
follows. Fixing attention on a particular curve 𝛾, we may always pick a metric 𝑔𝑎𝑏
in the conformal class so that the given parameterisation 𝑡is by arc-length. Having
done this, the remaining freedom 𝑔𝑎𝑏↦→b𝑔𝑎𝑏=Ω2𝑔𝑎𝑏is constrained by requiring
thatΩ|𝛾=1 and it follows that 𝜕Ω= 0 along𝛾, in other words that14 Michael Eastwood
𝑈𝑎Υ𝑎=0,whereΥ𝑎=Ω−1∇𝑎Ω. (23)
Recall that the normalised jerk 𝐽𝑏, defined by (2), is conformally invariant of
weight−1. It follows that
b𝜕𝐽𝑏=𝜕𝐽𝑏−2𝑈𝑎Υ𝑎𝐽𝑏−𝑈𝑎𝐽𝑎Υ𝑏+Υ𝑎𝐽𝑎𝑈𝑏.
But recall that 𝑈𝑎𝐽𝑎=0, so from (1) we conclude that the normalised snap
𝑆𝑎≡𝜕𝐽𝑎+𝐴𝑏𝐽𝑏𝑈𝑎
transforms quite simply by
b𝑆𝑎=𝑆𝑎−2𝑈𝑏Υ𝑏𝐽𝑎.
Therefore, along a parameterised curve with conformal factor constrained by (23),
we find that the normalised snap is conformally (or M ¨obius) invariant. Therefore, the
equation𝑆𝑎=0 is an invariant fourth order ODE on parameterised curves, which is
certainly satisfied along conformal circles.
To compare with [9], let us introduce the Cotton-York tensor 𝑌𝑎𝑏𝑐≡2∇[𝑎P𝑏]𝑐,
which is M ¨obius invariant in two dimensions [3], conformally invariant in three
dimensions [2], and in higher dimensions transforms by
b𝑌𝑎𝑏𝑐=𝑌𝑎𝑏𝑐−𝑊𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑Υ𝑑, (24)
where𝑊𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑, the conformal Weyl tensor , is the trace-free part of Riemann tensor
and is conformally invariant. The contracted Bianchi identity
∇𝑑𝑊𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑+(𝑛−3)𝑌𝑎𝑏𝑐=0
for𝑛≥4 also shows 𝑌𝑎𝑏𝑐=0 in the conformally flat case. Indeed, tractor calculus
[2, 3] easily shows that 𝑌𝑎𝑏𝑐is the obstruction to M ¨obius or conformal flatness in
dimensions 2 or 3, whilst 𝑊𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑 is the obstruction in all higher dimensions.
From (1) we see that
𝑊𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑𝑈𝑐b𝐴𝑑=𝑊𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑𝑈𝑐𝐴𝑑−𝑊𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑𝑈𝑐Υ𝑑
and so from (24) it follows that the 2-form
𝐾𝑎𝑏≡𝑊𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑𝑈𝑐𝐴𝑑−𝑌𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑈𝑐
is M¨obius invariant in dimension 2 and conformally invariant in all dimensions 𝑛≥3
(the Weyl tensor vanishes by symmetry considerations in dimensions 2 and 3). The
2-form𝐾𝑎𝑏evidently vanishes in the M ¨obius or conformally flat cases. (An invariant
rˆole for𝐾𝑎𝑏remains mysterious but it certainly looks like 𝐾𝑎𝑏should arise from
some tractor curvature [2, §2.5].)Conformal Loxodromes 15
Josef ˇSilhan has checked that, with the notation introduced above, the invariant
fourth order ODE [9, Equation (4.14)] reads 𝑆𝑎=𝐾𝑎𝑏𝑈𝑏. When𝐾𝑎𝑏=0, solutions
of this equation evidently include the conformal circles 𝐽𝑎=0 but otherwise,
as unparameterised curves in flat two-dimensional space, must be loxodromes in
accordance with Theorem 3 above and this is confirmed by calculation in [9, §5].
I would like to thank Maciej Dunajski for drawing my attention to [9] after I had
carelessly forgotten its contents.
6 Outlook
The novelty of conformal loxodromes in 2 dimensions stems from their conformal
invariance on the flat model, the round 2-sphere. What I believed to be missing
for conformal geometry in higher dimensions was a classification of homogeneous
curves on the round 𝑛-sphere, generalising Theorem 3 above. However, it was pointed
out to me by an anonymous referee that such a classification has been carried out
for the 3-sphere in an unpublished work of Sulanke [15, Theorem 1]. Not only that,
but his proof identifies these homogeneous curves as orbits of certain 1-parameter
subgroups of the group of conformal motions leading directly to their symmetry
algebras via an algorithm of [8] (reproduced in this context as [10, Lemma 6]). Thus,
we may insist, in higher dimensions, that 𝜕𝐽𝑏lie in span(𝑈𝑏,𝐽𝑏)so that𝜅may
be defined by (18) and then proceed to define a class of invariant curves by (22).
We could also call these curves ‘loxodromes’ but there are yet more homogeneous
curves in the 𝑛-sphere for𝑛≥3 and hence yet more analogues in the curved setting.
It would surely be useful to classify these invariant curves in all dimensions and
identify the ODE that control them. Conformal circles are proving themselves to
be increasingly useful in conformal differential geometry where important results,
for example [5], rely on knowing explicitly the ODE that controls where they go.
Conformal loxodromes and the multitude of other conformally invariant curves may
prove similarly useful. Of course, there are corresponding questions in all parabolic
geometries.
The anonymous referee also points out a general argument in [15, §3.2], which
says that the homogeneous curves in a homogeneous space 𝐺/𝐻are exactly those
having ‘constant curvatures’ and that, for example, the requirement that 𝜕𝐽𝑏lie in
span(𝑈𝑏,𝐽𝑏)may be interpreted as the curves with vanishing ‘conformal torsion.’
The referee suggests, therefore, that the corresponding curves in the curved setting
may also be approached as restrictions on their conformal curvatures. There are nice
classical formulæ for these curvatures (in three dimensions see [4]). It would be
interesting to compare the resulting theory with the ODE, yet to be derived via the
method of Doubrov- ˇZ´adn´ık [7], as were obtained for loxodromes in this article.16 Michael Eastwood
