Implementation and Performance Analysis of a Low
Resolution OFDM System Prototype With Low
Cost Hardware
Eder O. de Souza, Jo ˜ao T. Dias, Demerson N. Gonc ¸alves
Abstract —The present work focus on the implementation
and analyze of performance of a low-resolution OFDM system
prototype with low-cost hardware. A software defined radio
(SDR) system was chosen in this implementation due to its
various advantages over a traditional radio system. Among the
options of SDR devices available, the use of universal software
radio peripherals (USRP) was avoided due to its high cost,
despite its popularity in this field of research. Alternatively, a
combination of two low-cost SDRs, “Hackrf One” and “RTL-
SDR Blog V3” with the GNU Radio, a popular, free and open
source radio software, were used. Thus, it was possible to emulate
the behavior of a low resolution ADC in the receiver, characterize
its performance and estimate its energy savings. This allowed us
to determine the feasibility of building a component with the
analog-to-digital conversion function with few bits of resolution.
We conclude that the performance of an ADC with at least 5 bits
of resolution is pretty reasonable and that this reduction in the
number of bits, in comparison to 8-bit ADC, represents a fairly
expressive energy saving.

I. I NTRODUCTION
NEW applications of low latency, high connection den-
sity and ubiquitous connectivity are present in various
services of 5G networks, among them we can highlight the
internet of things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, telemedicine
and industry 4.0. These applications require an efficient and
flexible communication system, since the characteristics of the
physical (PHY) and medium access (MAC) layers in a network
architecture model (like OSI and TCP/IP) affect the overall
performance of the system in terms of energy efficiency,
spectral efficiency, achievable throughput, quality of service
(QoS), etc. [1].
An important factor in regard to energy efficiency aspect
is the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) resolution, once the
energy consumption is proportional to the number of bits
[2]. In this sense, some works have been take into account
the power consumption mitigation provided by low resolution
ADCs in potential 5G technologies [3], [4].In Reference [3],

sented, while in [4], important issues of systems relying on
low-resolution ADCs are discussed. Other works are dedicated
to show practical results by means of prototyping, usually with
the use of SDRs. Both References [5] and [6] are examples
of such strategy, while [5] introduces a architecture that can
interface different antennas to a SDR, [6] proposes a SDR
platform for transmission and acquisition of wideband signals.
In Reference [7], the authors implemented the IEEE 802.11ah
(Wi-Fi HaLow) standard, an extension of the Wi-Fi protocol
focused on providing IoT-like connectivity on midrange sites
(up to 1 km), simulation and experimental measurements
towards evaluating the performance and limitations in inter-
ference and noise environments. Although these works show
practical results, they lack the addressing of low resolution
ADCs.
The flexibility offered by SDRs make them capable of
prototyping very diverse communication technologies. Their
category may range from low complexity/low cost to very
advanced and expensive equipment. Perhaps the most popular
ones, in terms of paper publications, are the USRP models
from National Instruments/Ettus Research. Conversely, a low
cost alternative is the HackRF One, which is popular among
hobbyists but with very fewer related publications. The Ref-
erences [8] and [9] are some examples of works based on
this device, they address long range (LoRa) collision decoding
and the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction, respec-
tively. However, once again, the ADC issue is not considered.
Finally, [10] focuses on both algorithm design and system
implementation in the field of low-resolution quantization
communication. The work reports the construction of a proof-
of-concept prototyping system used to conduct over-the-air
(OTA) tests, but, overall, expensive hardware is applied. A
summary of the topics discussed is shown in Table I, where
is notable that none of them meet the combination of pro-
totyping, low cost hardware and low resolution ADC. That
combination of factors is exactly what this work proposes, by
the implementation of a prototyping system in order to emulate
and analyse the performance of a low resolution ADC.
Preliminary studies of this research were presented in Ref-
erences [11] and [12]. In this work, we show the feasibility of
implementing an actual low-resolution ADC and also supports
further investigations in future works. The rest of the work is
divided as follows: the OFDM communication system model
is presented in Section II; Section III presents the development
of this model and a brief description of the implementedarXiv:2302.05775v2  [eess.SP]  9 Nov 2023JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 38, NO.1, 2023. 150

II. Q-OFDM
The block diagram of the proposed quantized OFDM (Q-
OFDM) system is shown in Fig.1. In this system, bis the bit

The preamble is the size of an OFDM symbol and it
is inserted before the data sequence. The receiver knows
the preamble and uses this information to synchronize the
beginning of the data symbols, correct phase and frequency
deviations, as well as perform the first channel estimation. The
Fig. 1: Block diagram of the proposed Q-OFDM system.
OFDM is a multicarrier modulation scheme based on dividing
the serial data stream into parallel groups of streams that are
transmitted on orthogonal subcarriers. When an OFDM signal
crosses a time-dispersive or frequency-selective channel, the
subcarriers are only affected by a constant or frequency flat
channel. In this type of channel, the signal can be distorted
by intersymbolic interference (ISI). This problem is solved in
OFDM by inserting a copy of the last part of the symbol, also
known as a cyclic prefix (CP), at the beginning to absorb the
channel delay spreads. The OFDM signal can be expressed in
the time domain by [13]
x[n] =K−1X

Kn, (1)
where skis the data symbol on the k-th subcarrier and Kis
the number of subcarriers in the OFDM symbol.
The signal at the receiver input can be written by
y=x∗h+ω, (2)
where y∈C(K+CP+Np−1)×1,CP is the length of the
cyclic prefix, and Npis the number of paths consideredin the channel, x∈C(K+CP)×1,h∈C(Np)×(1)is the
channel impulse response, ∗is the convolution operation, and
ω∈C(K+CP+Np−1)×1is additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN).
A. Low resolution ADC
In this section, the low resolution ADC considered in this
work and its main characteristics will be described. The choice
of the linear quantizer Mid-Riser is due to its wide use, easy
implementation and good performance [14]. This quantizer
divides the signal to be mapped into equidistant quantization
levels, with a step size ∆and total number of quantization
levels ( V) given by V= 2♭, where ♭is the number of
quantization bits used in the ADC. For uniform and symmetric
Mid-Riser quantizers, the quantizer output levels are given by
the equation
vi=−V∆
2+ (i−1
2)∆. (3)
The quantizer input limits are defined by τ1=−∞,τL+1=
∞andτi=vi+∆
2, fori= 2,3, ..., V [14]. Therefore, for a
discrete input signal y, the characterization of this quantizer
is given by the Eq. ( 4) and illustrated in Fig. 2.

Riser quantizer.
The signal after the quantizer will take the form
yq=Qc(y), (5)
whereQc(.)denotes the elementary complex-valued quantizer
mapping function, which comprises two parallel real-valued
quantizers Q(.)that independently quantize the real and
imaginary parts of each analog input sample [15].
The received signal in the frequency domain can be written
as
ˆ s=g(Fyq), (6)JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 38, NO.1, 2023. 151
where Fis the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), a unitary
matrix of dimension K×Kandg(.)is the function of the
equalizer.
Due to the fact that the decision feedback equalizer (DFE)
is native to the OFDM library in GNU Radio [16] and
the objective is to observe in the MatLab simulation the
behavior of the bit error rate (BER) that must be found in
the prototyping, the OFDM system was simulated with the
same DFE equalizer present in the GNU Radio library, that
is, the simple DFE (SDFE).
In the SDFE, for each symbol tand for each subcarrier kin
each symbol, if it is a pilot carrier then we update the channel
state for kto be
H[k] =αˆH[k] + (1−α)ˆ st,k

where H[k]is the frequency response of the channel, αis
a parameter normally set to 0.1,ˆH[k]is a channel response
estimation obtained and applied in the forward filter, pkis
the pilot symbol corresponding to the kth index, and ˆst,kis
the estimated received symbol. The expression (1−α)ˆst,k
pkis
obtained and applied in the feedback filter.
If the subcarrier is not a pilot subcarrier, then we update the
channel in a similar way. First, let the equalized symbol just
be¯st,k
Ht[k], where ¯st,kis the received symbol after the FFT and
before the equalizer. Next, we use the constellation mapper to
essentially “snap” the complex item to a complex item that
we know. Now that we know what this symbol really was
(the decision), we can use this feedback to update our channel
slightly, via the same equation above, Eq.(7), just using the
snapped complex number instead of the pilot symbol. The
Fig. 3 shows the simplified diagram of SDFE.
Fig. 3: Simplified diagram of SDFE.
We believe that the choice of GNU Radio for the DFE
equalizer is due to two disadvantages for OFDM systems free
of intercarrier and intersymbol interference. First, a longer
guard interval than the delay channel has to use in each
OFDM symbol period, thus resulting in a considerable loss
in bandwidth utilization efficiency. Second, FFT-based de-
modulation methods, although computationally simple, do not
use enough statistics for channel equalization, which degrades
performance [17].
III. Q-OFDM SYSTEM PROTOTYPING WITH SDR S
Here we discuss the details of the implementation of our
prototype system. In order to better organize the information
we divided this section into three subsections: characteristicsof the hardware [III-A], development of the low resolution
ADC block [III-B] and, finally, the description of the trans-
mitter and receiver projects [III-C].
A. Hardware used
The SDRs devices selected for this work were the HackRF
One [18] and the RTL-SDR Blog V3 [19]. Some information
about these devices is shown in the Table II, where we notice
that there is a window of compatibility between the SDRs
in relation to the values of the operating frequency and the
sampling rate. The chosen sampling rate was 1.8MS/s (Mega
Samples/seconds) and the chosen operating frequency was
dependent on the antennas.

Sample rate 20 MS/s 2.4 MS/s
The antennas used in the transmitter and receiver were both
simple monopole telescopic antennas with SMA connector. In
the case of HackRF One, which acted as the transmitter, in
addition to the antenna, a DC-Blocker was also used, in order
to provide a purely AC signal to the antenna.
The performance of the chosen antenna was characterized
in the range from 350 to450MHz using the NanoVNA-H
Rev3.6 [20], a cheap Vector Network Analyzer. And by using
the NanoVNASaver [21], a software tool for the NanoVNA,
we saved a Touchstone file, analyzed the data and plotted the
Smith chart and the VSWR graph, shown in the Fig. 4 and
Fig. 5, respectively. Based on this analysis we decided that
410MHz was good operating frequency for our prototype,
because in this frequency the antenna yields the minimum
VSWR value ( 1.238) and has an impedance that is close
enough to the input impedance of both SDR devices ( 50 Ω ).
The notebooks used in this work were the CCE Win T54P+,
which combined with the HackRF One formed the transmitter
SDR system; and the Lenovo idepad 310 - 14ISK notebook,
which combined with the RTL-SDR Blog V3 formed the
receiver SDR system. The Table III summarizes some basic
technical characteristics of both computers. The version 3.10
of GNU Radio was installed in both of them.

system. The transmitter SDR was placed on the left side and
the receiver SDR on the right side, with a distance of 1 m
between the antennas.
B. Low resolution ADC block
The Fig. 7 shows the GNU Radio Companion (GRC) project
of the low resolution ADC block implemented by the authors.
Note that this block is actually composed by others blocks,
which the GNU Radio documentation classifies as a “Hi-
erarchical Block” [22]. The signal flow passes through two
main blocks: the “Root Raised Cosine Filter”, which has the
function of simulating a DA conversion; and the “Quantizer”,
that quantizes the signal. The latter was created by the authors

from an “Embedded Python Block” [23], a special type of
GNU Radio block that allows the user to customize it through
a Python script.
Thus, the low resolution ADC block was available locally
in the GRC library under the name of “Low Resolution
Converter” and was used in the receiver design with different
resolution bits.
C. Transmitter and receiver designs
The GNU Radio code and projects used in this work are
publicly available on the GitHub platform [24]. The transmitter
design is shown in Fig. 8. Specific blocks are used for each
stage of an OFDM transmission and, on purpose, the resource
of an error correcting code is not used. The interface with
HackRF One is done through the “osmocom Sink” block.
The transmission consisted of sending 10 randomly gener-
ated binary files of 50B each for every noise level increment at
the receiver side. In the reception, each received file had a size
of15kB, which means 300repetitions of the transmitted file.
To calculate the BER of each noise level we first calculated
the BER related to each of the 10files of that specific level
and then we averaged the results. This process, repeated at
various noise levels.
The Fig. 9 shows the receiver design and configuration that
allows the collection of data from three distinct events: the
average signal power, the low resolution ADC performance
estimation and the receiver SDR performance. The information
regarding the average signal power is given by the “Probe Avg
Magˆ 2” block [25]. The “Low Resolution Converter” block
emulates the behavior of an ADC with variable bit resolution.JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 38, NO.1, 2023. 153
Fig. 8: Block diagram of transmitter.
By disabling it from the project it is possible to collect
data directly from the RTL-SDR’s 8-bit ADC. Similar to the
transmitter design, specific blocks are used for each stage of an
OFDM reception with the omission of an error correction and
the interface with the SDR done by the “osmocom Source”
block. Furthermore, there was also the addition of the Gaussian
noise, through the “Noise Source” block, to provide different
levels of signal to noise ratio (SNR).
Thus, knowing the noise levels and the average power of the
signal it was possible to calculate the SNR and the survey of
the BER curves shown in Section IV. The measurements were
performed with a distance of 1 meter between the antennas.
IV. R ESULTS
First, to evaluate the impact of the number of quantizer bits
on the power consumption of the ADC, the power consump-
tion curve per number of quantization bits was drawn up. To
this end, the expression described in [26] was used, which lists
the energy consumed by an ADC in relation to the number of
resolution bits:
PADC=cfs2♭, (8)
where ♭represents the number of bits of resolution, cis a
constant associated with the noise merit figure, and fsis the
sampling rate.
This simulation was carried out with fs= 1.8MHz and
c= 496 fJ/conv-step (Fento Joule / conversion-step) [27]. As
we can see in Fig. 10, the impact of power consumption is
more significant when the number of bits is greater than 5bits.
In order to validate the proposed system and analyze its
performance by varying the number of bits, BER curves were
initially created by simulation in MatLab considering the
parameters shown in the Table IV:
To choose the channel model used in the simulation, all
multipath channel models presented in Annex 4of the ITU-
R BT.2035 [28] document, for the scenario in question, were
analyzed and we came to the conclusion that the model thatTABLE IV: Simulation parameters.

The Fig. 11 shows the performance of the BER as a function
of the SNR in the MatLab simulation.
The satisfactory results of the simulation motivated the
realization of practical tests with hardware, that is, with the
prototype based on SDRs.
The results of our prototype system are shown in the Fig.
12, where the performance of the receiver SDR is indicated
by the “Hardware” curve and the other curves are results for
different resolution bits in the “Low Resolution Converter”
block of the receiver project, which is indicated in the graph
legend by the term “LRC” followed by the number of bits
used in each measurement.
Due to the fact that the 1 and 2 bit resolution curves present
very poor BER performance and generate a plateau with a very
high BER value during the simulation with MatLab, Fig.11,
they were not considered in our tests with the prototype.
As the MatLab simulation results show that the 6, 7 and 8 bit
resolution curves present overlapping in the BER performance,
Fig.11, and these cases imply greater energy consumption,
as we see in fig.10, in addition to the fact that we observed
overrun problems for resolutions greater than 5 bits in severalJOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 38, NO.1, 2023. 154

tests carried out. For these reasons, we removed 6, 7 and 8 bit
resolutions curves from our analysis.
As described in the session III-C, to generate the curves
were sent bursts of 10 randomly generated binary files of 50B
each for every noise level increment at the receiver side. In
the reception side, for each received burst, an frame of size of
15kB, which means 300 repetitions of the transmitted file is
used to obtain the SNR and BER calculate. All curves of the
graph in Fig. 12 falls within the SNR range from 16.456dB to
26.403dB. The “LRC 3b” curve starts with a BER of 4.2498×
10−2and after a SNR of 20dB it reaches a plateau around a
BER of 2.5×10−3. The “LRC 4b” curve starts with a BER
of1.3923×10−2and we did not observe the occurrence of a
plateau, in agreement with what was observed in the MatLab
simulation, Fig.11. The “LRC 5b” curve starts with a BER of

V. C ONCLUSION
Based on the prototyping work presented in this research,
it is safe to say that there is a basis for creating critical
hardware for systems that require high energy efficiency, that
is, an ADC with less than 8 bits of resolution. It is possible
to reinforce the importance of the subject discussed, since
it can strongly impact the prototyping of radio systems in
the laboratory. The use of SDRs allows flexibility to test
different radio communication systems with the same device.
And although SDRs such as USRP are already widely used in
research, this work has shown that there are low-cost devices
on the market that can fulfill this function. The contents
presented here demonstrate that many other researches can
still be carried out on prototyping using low-cost SDRs, dueJOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 38, NO.1, 2023. 155

to the importance of the topic and numerous contributions to
the academic environment. As an example of future work,
one can consider implementing a receiver in GNU Radio that
takes into account the quantization noise and thus improves
the performance of the presented system even when running
in low resolution.
