1. Introduction
The coeﬃcients and higher-order derivatives of cyclotomic polynomials have long been en-
gaging mathematicians’ interests. The n-th cyclotomic polynomial
Φn(x) :=/productdisplay
0<k≤n
(k,n)=1/parenleftBig
x−e2πik/n/parenrightBig
is the minimal polynomial of the n-th primitive roots of unity over Q. Since collecting all
n-th roots of unity yields xn−1 =/producttext
d|nΦd(x), the M¨ obius inversion leads to the equivalent
expression
Φn(x) =/productdisplay
d|n(xd−1)µ(n/d),
whereµis the M¨ obius function. The study on the higher-order deriv ative values of Φ n(x) at
x= 1, which is the subject of this article, goes back to V.-A. Le besgue in 1859 [ 6] and H¨ older
in 1936 [ 5]. The general foundations of this subject were established by Lehmer in 1966 [ 7].
Since then, it has been studied continuously and extensivel y, as summarized in [ 4] and [8].
Recently, Akiyama and Kaneko [ 1, Theorem 3] discovered “curious congruences” for odd-
orderderivatives of cyclotomic polynomials. Let φ(n) = degΦ n(x) betheEulertotient function.
Then, 2Φ(3)
n(1) is divisible by φ(n)−2. Moreover, for k >1, Φ(2k+1)
n(1) is divisible by φ(n)−2k.
According to Lehmer [ 7], there explicitly exist polynomials Fk(x1,...,x k)∈Q[x1,...,x k]
such that Φ(k)
n(1)/Φn(1) =Fk(φ(n)/2,J2(n)/4,...,J k(n)/2k), where Jk(n) is Jordan’s totient
function. The polynomials will be discussed in detail in Section 3 , then Akiyama and Kaneko
posed the following conjecture as an analogue of the above co ngruences.
Conjecture 1.1 ([1, Conjecture 1]) .For any non-negative integer k,F2k+1(x1,...,x 2k+1)is
divisible by x1−kinQ[x1,...,x 2k+1].
In this article, we prove this conjecture. The divisibility suggests a direct relationship with
Akiyama–Kaneko’s congruences, but it should be noted that Conjecture 1.1 does not immedi-
ately yield them. In Section 4 , we penetrate a certain integrality property of the polynom ialFk
and give a new proof for the curious congruences as a corollar y.

12. Preliminaries
We review the basic functions used in this article. Jordan’s totient functions Jk(n) are a
generalization of the Euler totient function. We give its tw o equivalent deﬁnitions,
Jk(n) =nk/productdisplay
p|n(1−p−k) =/summationdisplay
d|nµ(n/d)dk, (2.1)
wherepruns over prime divisors of nandddoes over all divisors of n. We easily see that Jk(n)
is even for any k≥1 andn≥3. The special case φ(n) =J1(n) is the Euler totient function.
For the details, see [ 9, Chapter V.3].

3. Lehmer’s observation and a proof of Conjecture 1.1
Foranyk≥1, weintroducethepolynomials sk(x1,...,x k)∈Q[x1,...,x k]andFk(x1,...,x k)∈

s1(x1) =−x1,
s2(x1,x2) =1
3(3x1−x2),
s3(x1,x2,x3) =−1
2(2x1−x2),
s4(x1,...,x 4) =1
90(90x1−55x2+x4),
s5(x1,...,x 5) =−1
36(36x1−25x2+x4),
and
F1(x1) =x1,
F2(x1,x2) =1

1−(40x2+36)x1+5x2
2+25x2−x4).
We note that odd-numbered variables other than x1do not appear since the Bernoulli numbers
satisfyBn= 0 for any odd n≥3.
By the generating function ( 2.5), and the deﬁnitions of the polynomials sk(x1,...,x k) and
Fk(x1,...,x k), we have the following generating functions.
Lemma 3.1. We deﬁne the functions Q(x,t)andP(x,t)by
Q(x,t) :=−2∞/summationdisplay
n=1Bn

In1966, Lehmer[ 7, Theorem3]showed, for n≥2, thatthederivativevaluesΦ(k)

also [1]).

3Besides the original proof by Lehmer, another proof by Herre ra-Poyatos–Moree [ 4] has been
known recently.
To prove Conjecture 1.1 , we ﬁrst provide a proof for the unproven Lehmer observation given
in [7, Section 7]. First, the polynomials Ω m, for which Lehmer observed only the ﬁrstfew terms,
are generally determined as follows.
Deﬁnition 3.3. We deﬁne the polynomials Ω m(x2,x4,...,x 2m)∈Q[x2,x4,...,x 2m] by the
generating series
1+2∞/summationdisplay
m=1B2m
(2m)!Ωm(x2,...,x 2m)u2m:= exp/parenleftBigg
2∞/summationdisplay
ν=1B2ν
(2ν)!/parenleftBig

.
The ﬁrst few examples of the polynomials Ω mare
Ω1(x2) =x2,
Ω2(x2,x4) =x4−5x2(x2−1),
Ω3(x2,x4,x6) =x6−7x4(x2−1)+35
3x2(x2−1)(x2−2)+14
3x2,
which coincide with the table in [ 7].
Theorem 3.4. We have
Fk(x1,...,x k) = (x1)k+2⌊k/2⌋/summationdisplay
m=1B2m/parenleftbiggk
2m/parenrightbigg
(x1−m)k−2mΩm(x2,...,x 2m).
Proof. Since
log(1+t) = 2sinh−1/parenleftbiggt
2√1+t/parenrightbigg
holds, comparingwiththedeﬁnitionofΩ mandthegenerating functionfor Fk(3.4), (3.6)implies
P(x,t) = (1+ t)x1+2∞/summationdisplay
m=1B2m
(2m)!Ωm(x2,...,x 2m)t2m(1+t)x1−m.
Finally, ( 2.6) gives
P(x,t) =∞/summationdisplay

which concludes the proof. /square
Corollary 3.5 (Conjecture 1.1 ).For any non-negative integer k,F2k+1(x1,...,x 2k+1)is divis-
ible byx1−kinQ[x1,...,x 2k+1].
Proof. In the expression of F2k+1(x1,...,x 2k+1) inTheorem 3.4 , the factorial notations
(x1)2k+1and (x1−m)2k+1−2mare divisible by x1−k. /square
4. Akiyama–Kaneko’s congruences
Akiyama–Kaneko discovered congruences on the odd-order de rivative values Φ(2k+1)
n(1)∈Z.
Theorem 4.1 ([1, Theorem 3]) .We have the following.
(1) 2Φ(3)
n(1)is divisible by φ(n)−2.
(2)Suppose that k≥2. ThenΦ(2k+1)
n(1)is divisible by φ(n)−2k.
More strongly, they observed that Φ(2k+1)
n(1)/Φn(1) is likely to be divisible by φ(n)−2k
fork≥2. Their congruences suggest a direct relationship with the divisibility shown in
the previous section, but it should be noted that Corollary 3.5 does not immediately yield
Theorem 4.1 . Our second theorem ( Theorem 4.5 ) gives a certain integrality property of the
4polynomials Fk(x1,...,x k), which relates them directly. We begin by preparing useful series of
lemmas.
Lemma 4.2. For any integer n≥1, we deﬁne the polynomial Vn(x)∈Q[x]by
Vn(x) :=/productdisplay
1≤k<n/2/parenleftbigg
x2+4sin2/parenleftbiggπk
n/parenrightbigg/parenrightbigg
(4.1)
withV1(x) =V2(x) = 1. ThenVn(x)∈Z[x]and we have
sinh(nθ) =/braceleftBigg
sinhθVn(2sinhθ)ifn:odd,
sinh2θVn(2sinhθ)ifn:even.(4.2)
Proof. We ﬁrst recall two kinds of Chebyshev polynomials Tn(x),Un(x)∈Z[x] character-
ized byTn(cosθ) = cosnθandUn−1(cosθ) = sinnθ/sinθ. The characterizations immediately
lead to the following.
sinh(nθ) =/braceleftBigg
(−1)n+1
2iTn(isinhθ) if n: odd,
(−1)n
2icoshθUn−1(isinhθ) ifn: even.
Let deﬁne the polynomials /tildewideVn(x) by
/tildewideVn(x) :=

xTn/parenleftbiggix
2/parenrightbigg
ifn: odd,
(−1)n
2i
xUn−1/parenleftbiggix
2/parenrightbigg
ifn: even.
It is then enough to show that /tildewideVn(x)∈Z[x] and/tildewideVn(x) =Vn(x). By the known explicit formulas
for the Chebyshev polynomials (see [ 3, Section 10.11 (22), (23)]), we have
/tildewideVn(x) =

Sincen(n−m−1)!
m!(n−2m)!=/parenleftbign−m
m/parenrightbig

m−1/parenrightbig
, we see that /tildewideVn(x)∈Z[x]. As for the coincidence, since
bothVn(x) and/tildewideVn(x) are monic polynomials, it suﬃces to check the locations of t heir zeros.
For an odd n, the set of zeros of /tildewideVn(x) are given by {2icos(2k+1)π
2n∈C|0≤k < n}\{0}, which
coincides with the set {2isinπk
n∈C|0<|k| ≤n−1
2}of zeros of Vn(x). A similar argument
works for even n. /square
Lemma 4.3. For any integer n≥1, we deﬁne the polynomial Wn(x)∈Q[x]by
Wn(x) :=/productdisplay
1≤k<n/2
(k,n)=1/parenleftbigg
x2+4sin2/parenleftbiggπk

withW1(x) =W2(x) = 1. Then for any n≥3, we have

Φn(1)Wn(x) = 1+2∞/summationdisplay
m=1B2m
(2m)!ωm(n)x2m,
where we put ωm(n) = Ωm(J2(n)/4,...,J 2m(n)/2m)∈Q.

which concludes the proof. /square
Lemma 4.4. For any integer n≥3and1≤m < φ(n)/2, we have
2B2m
(2m)!ωm(n)∈Z.
Proof. ByVn(x) =/producttext
d|nWd(x) andVn(x)∈Z[x], Gauss’ lemma implies Wn(x)∈Z[x].
Thus it suﬃces to show that all coeﬃcients of Wn(x) except for the highest degree term xφ(n)
are divisible by Φ n(1). We recall that the value Φ n(1) is explicitly given by
Φn(1) =/braceleftBigg
pifn=pr, pis prime,
1 if otherwise .
Thus we now assume that n=pris a power of a prime number p. By (4.4), we have
Wpr(x)Vpr−1(x) =Vpr(x). By the explicit formula ( 4.3),Vpr(x)≡xpr−1(modp) for an odd
pandV2r(x)≡x2r−2(mod 2). Thus, for an odd prime p, we have Wpr(x)xpr−1−1≡xpr−1
(modp), which implies that Wpr(x)≡xφ(pr)(modp). The same argument works for p= 2./square
Theorem 4.5. For any integers n≥3and1≤k < φ(n), the polynomial Fk,n(x)deﬁned by
Fk,n(x) =Fk(x,J2(n)/4,...,J k(n)/2k)is inZ[x].
Proof. ByTheorem 3.4 , the polynomial Fk,n(x) is given by
Fk,n(x) = (x)k+⌊k/2⌋/summationdisplay
m=1k!
(k−2m)!2B2m
(2m)!ωm(n)(x−m)k−2m. (4.5)
Lemma 4.4 implies that, for any 1 ≤k < φ(n),Fk,n(x)∈Z[x]. /square
Finally, we show Akiyama–Kaneko’s observation, a reﬁned ve rsion of Theorem 4.1 as a
corollary of Theorem 4.5 .
Corollary 4.6. We have the following.
(1) 2Φ(3)
n(1)/Φn(1)is divisible by φ(n)−2.
6(2)Suppose that k≥2. ThenΦ(2k+1)
n(1)/Φn(1)is divisible by φ(n)−2k.
Proof. SincedegΦ n(x) =φ(n)isevenfor n≥3, itissuﬃcienttoconsideronlythecasesfor
n≥3 and 3≤2k+1< φ(n). ByCorollary 3.5 andTheorem 4.5 ,F2k+1,n(x)∈Z[x] is divisible
byx−k. Therefore, F2k+1,n(φ(n)/2) = Φ(2k+1)
n(1)/Φn(1) isdivisibleby φ(n)/2−k. Inparticular,
ifk≥2, the expression ( 4.5) yields that F2k+1,n(φ(n)/2) is divisible by 2( φ(n)/2−k)./square
