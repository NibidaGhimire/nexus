We present a novel inequality on the purity of a bipartite state depending solely on the length-
difference of the local Bloch vectors. For two qubits this inequality is tight for all marginal states and
so extends the previously known solution for the 2-qubit marginal problem. With this inequality we
construct a 3-dimensional Bloch model of the 2-qubit quantum state space in terms of Bloch lengths,
providing a pleasing visualization of this high-dimensional state space. This allows to characterize
quantum states by a strongly reduced set of parameters and to investigate the interplay between
local properties of the marginal systems and global properties encoded in the correlations.
I. INTRODUCTION
The investigation of fundamental bounds in the form of
entropy inequalities, limiting the distribution of informa-
tion within a multipartite system, marked the birth of in-
formation theory as a field of study [1]. In the same way,
the exploration of fundamental limitations on the distri-
bution of quantum information within a system lies at the
core of the rapidly evolving field of quantum information
theory. Analogous results to classical information theory
were found for the von Neumann entropy [2–4], but at
the same time there remain many open questions [5, 6].
Moreover, these are not the only known constraints to
the distribution of quantum information within a system.
Monogamy relations bound the shared entanglement that
a party can have with other parties and thus ultimately
limit the set of attainable quantum states [7–17].
The classical probability space is described geometri-
cally by a simplex of the corresponding dimension. While
the latter geometrically is fairly regular, the quantum
state space becomes a highly complex object that ad-
mits no simple description [18, 19]. Ultimately the char-
acterization of attainable quantum states is linked to
the famous quantum marginal problem, investigating the
compatibility between local and global eigenvalues of a
state [20, 21].
In this work we present a novel constraint of the purity
of any bipartite quantum state, based solely on the differ-
ence of the local Bloch lengths, i.e., the Hilbert-Schmidt
distance of the marginal states to the normalized iden-
tity. For two qubits this constraint is tight for all possible
marginal states, thus extending the previously known so-
lution for the marginal problem for two qubits [22]. The
∗smorelli@bcamath.org
†jens.siewert@ehu.eusbound can be interpreted as a new constraint on the lin-
ear entropy of a bipartite system, as the linear entropy
has a one-to one correspondence to the Bloch lengths,
and also be extended to a constraint of the local Bloch
lengths of pure tripartite states.
We then use this novel inequality to construct a three
dimensional model for the state space of two qubits,
where we use the two local Bloch lengths and the cor-
relation tensor length as the coordinates. This allows
to characterize important properties of states based on
a very reduced set of parameters. In the model we fur-
ther identify regions of special interest, such as purely
entangled and purely separable regions. It is worthwhile
mentioning here that all our discussion and results are
based on the lengths of Bloch vectors, which are directly
accessible in experiments and, because of their local uni-
tary invariance, are particularly interesting in the context
of the arising field of randomized measurements [23–25].
II. QUANTUM STATE SPACE AND THE
BLOCH REPRESENTATION
In what is known as the Bloch representation, density
operators of qubits are parametrized by the Pauli matri-
cesσx,σy,σzand the identity 12
ρ=1
2(12+x σx+y σy+z σz), (1)
where x,yandzare real numbers satisfying x2+y2+z2≤
1 [26, 27]. Hence, the state space Q2of a qubit can be
identified with a three-dimensional ball of radius 1 about
the origin, with a one to one correspondence between
Bloch vectors v=(x, y, z)and states ρ.
Unfortunately, the Bloch ball falls short of giving an
extensive comprehension of the state space of quantum
systems, not because of shortcomings of the geometricarXiv:2303.11400v2  [quant-ph]  22 Jan 20242
model but because the system of a single qubit itself is
too elementary to exhibit all the complex features of a
general quantum system. Looking at higher-dimensional
systems gives a richer and more diverse structure of the
quantum state-space and its geometrical representation,
e.g., Refs. [18, 19, 28–35]. The Bloch representation ex-
ists also for higher-dimensional systems. We call a basis
{µi}d2−1
i=0satisfying µ0=1dand Tr (µiµ†
j)=dδija Bloch
basis [36]. Every state of a d-dimensional system can be
expanded in such a basis as
ρ=1
d(1d+d2−1
∑
i=1viµi), (2)
where we do not include v0=1 in the definition of the
Bloch vector v. While the Bloch vector itself clearly de-
pends on the Bloch basis, the length of the Bloch vec-
tor∥v∥2=√
dTr(ρ2)−1 is independent of the choice of
Bloch basis as well as state basis, as this quantity is uni-
tarily invariant. To reflect the fact that no basis choice
with corresponding Bloch vector is needed to define this
quantity, we will refer to it simply as Bloch length. From
now on, if not stated otherwise, all norms of vectors will
be the 2-norm and we omit the subscript.
As interesting and complex as these single systems are,
they still lack an essential property: they are unable
to display correlations [37] between different parties of
a more complex quantum system. Steps in that direc-
tion were taken in Ref. [38–40]. One can extend local
Bloch bases to a product basis of a multipartite system,
retaining the party structure of the system. Let {µA
i}
and{µB
j}be Bloch bases for the systems AandBof
equal dimension d. Then {µA
i⊗µB
j}is a Bloch basis for
the joint system and every state can be expressed as
ρAB=1
d2(1d2+∑
iaiµA
i⊗1d+∑
jbj1d⊗µB
j+∑
i,jtijµA
i⊗µB
j).
(3)
The local Bloch vectors aandbencode all the infor-
mation of the local states ρA=TrB(ρAB)andρB=
TrA(ρAB)respectively. Correlations [37] are encoded
in the correlation tensor TAB. These concepts can be
straightforwardly generalized for multipartite systems.
Here and in the following we consider only systems of
equal local dimensions, but all concepts are also well de-
fined for systems of arbitrary local dimensions.
III. PURITY CONSTRAINT FROM
SECTOR-DIFFERENCE
An immediate consequence of the Schmidt decompo-
sition is that for every pure bipartite quantum state the
marginal states are equal up to local unitaries. This
means that if the eigenvalues of the marginals are equal,
there exists no non-trivial constraint for the purity of
the global state. However, if the marginals have differenteigenvalues no pure state is compatible with those con-
straints. Therefore there exists a purity constraint based
on the difference of the local states. The following the-
orem gives an upper bound on the purity of a bipartite
quantum state based solely on the difference of the local
Bloch lengths. For qubits this bound is tight.
Theorem 1. For any bipartite state ρABwith equal local
dimension dit holds that
dTr(ρ2
AB)≤d−√
2d∣∥a∥−∥b∥∣+∣∥a∥−∥b∥∣2,(4)
where aandbare the local Bloch vectors of ρA=
TrB(ρAB)andρB=TrA(ρAB), respectively, and ∥⋅∥de-
notes the 2-norm.
Proof. Denote by ∆ =∣∥a∥−∥b∥∣. Note that any state
with eigenvalues λ=1−∆/√
2d, 1−λ=∆/√
2dandλj=0
(j>2) satisfies the inequality. Assume now that there
exist a state ρsuch that dTr(ρ2)>d−√
2d∆+∆2. Its
purity Tr (ρ2)≤λ2+(1−λ)2can only exceed the bound
of Eq. (4) if its leading eigenvalue satisfies λ>1−∆/√
2d.
Therefore it must hold that 1 −λ<∆/√
2d. Any state
can be written as
ρ=λ∣ψ⟩⟨ψ∣+(1−λ)σ, (5)
where ∣ψ⟩is the eigenvector of the eigenvalue λandσthe
sum of the projectors of the remaining eigenvectors in the
orthogonal subspace. Since all quantities in Eq. (4) are
invariant under local unitary operations, we can choose
any local basis to prove the statement. Writing this state
in the Schmidt basis of ∣ψ⟩, we find
ρA=λρψ+(1−λ)σA (6)
ρB=λρψ+(1−λ)σB, (7)
with equal marginals ρψ=TrB(∣ψ⟩⟨ψ∣)=TrA(∣ψ⟩⟨ψ∣).
Now it follows
1−λ<1√
2d∣∥a∥−∥b∥∣ (8)
=1√
2d∣∥dρA−1∥HS−∥dρB−1∥HS∣ (9)
≤1√
2∥ρA−ρB∥HS (10)
=1−λ√
2∥σA−σB∥HS (11)
≤1−λ, (12)
where ∥M∥HS=√
Tr(M†M)denotes the Hilbert-
Schmidt or Frobenius norm. For the last inequality we
have used ∥σA−σB∥HS≤√
2, which follows immediately
from the positivity of the matrices. But this is a con-
tradiction, therefore the assumption that there exists a
state ρviolating the inequality is wrong.
This bound improves the previously known bound fol-
lowing from the triangle inequality of the linear entropy,
see Fig. 1. Remarkable is the fact that for qubits this
inequality is not only tight with respect to the difference3
FIG. 1. The maximal value of Tr (ρ2)plotted against the
difference ∆ (ρ)=∣∥a∥−∥b∥∣for d=2. The bound of Eq. (4)
is shown in blue and the bound following from the triangle
inequality of the linear entropy in orange.
∣∥a∥−∥b∥∣, but actually for all values of ∥a∥and∥b∥,
see Eq. (22) for a family of states that saturate the in-
equality. But the local Bloch length describes the state of
the marginal qubits uniquely up to local unitaries, which
clearly do not change any of the quantities in the relation.
This means, that for every two marginal states, there ex-
ists a global state compatible with them that saturates
the inequality. So we give at the same time a more ex-
tensive answer to the pure two-qubit marginal problem
and a physically meaningful interpretation of the solu-
tion of the general two-qubit marginal problem [22]. We
are able to exactly quantify the maximum purity of any
global state compatible with any two given marginals (or
in fact only the difference of their local Bloch lengths).
A direct consequence of this inequality is that for any
pure tripartite state of equal local dimension it holds that
the three local Bloch lengths satisfy
∥c∥2≤d−1−√
2d∣∥a∥−∥b∥∣+∣∥a∥−∥b∥∣2. (13)
This can be seen by noting that for a pure three-party
state it holds that Tr (ρ2
AB)=Tr(ρ2
C)and inserting this
into Eq. (4).
For qubits this relation can be simplified to the known
inequality
∥a∥+∥c∥≤1+∥b∥, (14)
following directly from the solution of the n-qubit
marginal problem [41, 42]. It is saturated by states of
the form
∣ψ⟩=√
x−y
2∣001⟩+√
1+y
2∣010⟩+√
1−x
2∣100⟩.(15)
While conceptually different, this constraint can be
compared to the famous Coffman-Kundu-Wootters rela-
tion (CKW) [7]. The states that saturate this relation for
three qubits form a strict subset of the states saturating
CKW. This means that CKW is sharp in a larger region
than this novel constraint, thus proving it to be weakerthan CKW. At the same time Eq. (13) holds in all finite
dimensions, opening an exciting new avenue for the study
of high-dimensional multipartite quantum systems.
IV. A THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL FOR
TWO QUBITS
By taking tensor products of the Pauli matrices, this
matrix-basis for the density operators of a single qubit
can be extended to a product basis of the composite space
of multiple qubits. That is, every two-qubit state can be
expanded in the product Pauli basis
ρAB=1
4(14+∑
iaiσi⊗12+∑
jbj12⊗σj+∑
i,jtijσi⊗σj),
(16)
where i, j=x, y, z andai=⟨σi⊗12⟩≡Tr(ρ σi⊗12),
bj=⟨12⊗σj⟩andtij=⟨σi⊗σj⟩. The state space of
a two-qubit system is now characterized by 15 real pa-
rameters and can thus be identified with a region in R15.
While the condition ∑ia2
i+∑jb2
j+∑i,jt2
ij≤3 is still neces-
sary to describe a state, it is not sufficient any longer, see
Ref. [38, 43] for necessary and sufficient criteria. While
points of this object are bijectively mapped to quantum
states, the high dimensionality makes it sometimes diffi-
cult to work with and limits its usefulness for visualiza-
tions. Moreover, a full description of the quantum state
is often not desired, rather than general constraints on
physically relevant quantities, such as purities and en-
tropies. In the following we focus on a more restricted
set of parameters to construct a lower-dimensional model
of the quantum state space of a two-qubit system. We
compress the local information of each subsystem into a
single coordinate. The state of a qubit is characterized
uniquely up to local unitaries by its purity, or alterna-
tively, the length of its Bloch vector. With this choice
we obtain our first two coordinates
x=∥a∥∶=√
∑
ia2
i, y=∥b∥∶=√
∑
jb2
j, (17)
as the local Bloch lengths, i.e., the length of the Bloch
vector of the reduced state in the corresponding subsys-
tem. Finally, the last coordinate describes the strength
of (classical and quantum) correlation between the local
states. As the third coordinate we choose
z=∥TAB∥∶=√
∑
i,jt2
ij, (18)
the remaining length of the global Bloch vector not en-
coded in the local Bloch vectors, which we call the cor-
relation tensor length ∥TAB∥.
With these reduced coordinates we can describe the
set of points (∥a∥,∥b∥,∥TAB∥)attainable by quantum
states. Besides positivity of the entries, the set is com-4

local Bloch lengths ∥a∥,∥b∥and the correlation tensor length

pletely characterized by the inequalities
∥TAB∥≥∥a∥+∥b∥−1 (19)
∥TAB∥2≤3+∥a∥2+∥b∥2−4∥a∥∥b∥−4∣∥a∥−∥b∥∣,(20)
in the sense that all quantum states are mapped into
the set defined by the inequalities and for every point
satisfying both inequalities there exists at least one state
that is mapped to it.
Eq. (19) was already proven in Ref. [44] and
Eq. (20) follows directly from Eq. (4) using the identity
d2Tr(ρ2
AB)=1+∥a∥2+∥b∥2+∥TAB∥2. Eq. (19) cuts out
the lower corner of the Bloch model, depicted in blue in
Fig. 2. It is saturated by states of the form
ρlb(p, q)=p∣0⟩⟨0∣⊗1/2+q1/2⊗∣0⟩⟨0∣+(1−p−q)∣00⟩⟨00∣
(21)
see Ref. [44] for more details. Eq. (20) gives an upper
bound, shown in orange in Fig. 2. It is saturated by
states of the form
ρub(p, q)=p∣ϕ(q)⟩⟨ϕ(q)∣+(1−p)∣ij⟩⟨ij∣,(22)
where ∣ϕ(q)⟩=√q∣00⟩+√1−q∣11⟩andi≠j∈{0,1}. It
follows that ∥a∥=1−2pj−2pq,∥b∥=1−2pi−2pqand
∣∥a∥−∥b∥∣=2p. Since Tr (ρub(p, q)2)=1−2p+2p2, Eq. (4),
as well as Eq. (20), are saturated. The coordinates are
length preserving, the length of the global Bloch vector is√
∥a∥2+∥b∥2+∥TAB∥2, so the distance from the origin
in our model remains the Bloch length. The resulting
shape is convex with flat and curved surfaces. Since for
pure states ∥a∥=∥b∥, all pure states lie on a circular arc
of radius√
3 spanning from (0,0,√
3), representing max-
imally entangled states, to (1,1,1), representing product
states. This forms the ridge of the model shown in Fig. 2.
The maximally mixed state 14/4 is mapped to the ori-
gin. The model has three ”artificial” boundaries, since
the norms we consider are always non-negative. In this
sense, the boundaries where one coordinate is zero are
not considered surfaces of the model.
The upper boundary consists of rank-2 states, they
turn out to be exactly the states maximizing the entan-
glement for given mixedness of the subsystems discussed
later. The lower boundary consists of states of rank 3.
So all boundaries are occupied only by states of reduced
rank. The converse does not hold, i.e., there are states
of rank 2 and rank 3 that are mapped to the interior.
However, all the states that map to the interior of the
ball with radius 1 /3 around the origin are of full rank.
The classical state space of a system with doutcomes
is the set of all probability vectors of size dand is de-
scribed by a simplex Sd−1. This set can be identified
with the set of diagonal quantum states of the same size.
For a 2-bit classical system, the states, corresponding
to diagonal quantum states, form a 3-dimensional sub-
set in the quantum states space in form of the simplex
S3, or tetrahedron. Using a parametrization in the Pauli
matrices (⟨σz⊗12⟩,⟨12⊗σz⟩,⟨σz⊗σz⟩), this tetrahe-
dron corresponds to the convex hull of the points (1,1,1),
(−1,−1,1),(−1,1,−1)and(1,−1,−1). The intersection
with the positive octant is inscribed in our model, de-
scribed by the convex hull of the points (1,1,1),(1,0,0),
(0,1,0),(0,0,1)and(0,0,0). Looking closely at Eq. (4)
one notices a remarkable fact: The inequality is sat-
urated everywhere and depends only on the difference
of the local Bloch lengths. But since the trace is in-
variant under unitary transformations, this means that
all boundary states with equal local Bloch length dif-
ference have the same distance from the origin. In fact
we notice that the states on the lower edge ρlb(p,0)=
p∣00⟩⟨00∣+(1−p) ∣0⟩⟨0∣⊗1/2 form exactly the states on
the boundary, if rotated by the entangling unitary
U(θ)=cosθ(∣00⟩⟨00∣+∣11⟩⟨11∣)+sinθ(∣11⟩⟨00∣−∣00⟩⟨11∣)
+∣01⟩⟨01∣+∣10⟩⟨10∣. (23)
Therefore our model is obtained by rotating the classi-
cal probability space about the axis (1,−1,0), visualizing
the fact that all quantum states can be obtained by an
appropriate unitary rotation of a positive and normalized
diagonal matrix.5
FIG. 3. Entangled and separable region in our model. The
purely entangled region defined by Eq. (24) is shown in or-
ange, being mapped into this region is already a sufficient
condition for entanglement. In blue there is the separable
ball of radius 1 /√
3, that is extended to the purely separable
region defined by Eq. (26) shown in green. For every point
in the area in between there exists both an entangled and a
separable state mapping to that point. So these are in fact
the strongest criteria for separability and entanglement that
can be found in this model.
V. ENTANGLED AND SEPARABLE REGIONS
One interesting question is to locate entangled states
in this picture. The z-axis shows the correlation between
the two subsystems. This correlation is the sum of the
classical and the quantum correlations, see Ref. [45]. Al-
though states mapping to the same point in the model
have the same amount of correlation, the respective parts
of classical and quantum correlation might differ consid-
erably. Therefore separable and entangled states will not
map into two disjoint regions. Nevertheless there can
be regions where only entangled or only separable states
map into.
It was shown that the condition SL(ρAB)<
max{SL(ρA), SL(ρB)}on the linear entropy SL(ρ)=
1−Tr(ρ2)implies that the state is entangled [46]. Us-
ingSL(ρA/B)=1−1/2(1+∥a/b∥2)and SL(ρAB)=
1−1/4(1+∥a∥2+∥b∥2+∥TAB∥2)this can be translated
into Bloch lengths [47]
∥TAB∥2>1−∣∥a∥2−∥b∥2∣. (24)This is a sufficient condition for entanglement, but it
is not necessary. For example, the Werner states [48]
for two qubits, ρW(p)=p∣ϕ+⟩⟨ϕ+∣+(1−p)1/4 are en-
tangled for every p>1/3, or ∥TAB∥>1/√
3. Since
∥a∥=∥b∥=0, the inequality would only detect en-
tanglement for ∥TAB∥>1. But nonetheless it is the
largest possible entangled region as, e.g., the state ρcc=
1/2(∣00⟩⟨00∣+∣11⟩⟨11∣is separable with ∥a∥=∥b∥=0
and∥TAB∥=1. It was shown that separable states can
achieve equality in Eq. (24) for all values of ∥a∥and
∥b∥[47]. In Fig. 3 this region is shown in orange. A
necessary condition for the violation of a Bell-inequality
of CHSH form is given by ∥TAB∥>1 [49].
A sufficient condition for separability was found by the
authors of Refs. [50, 51] in the form of a separable ball
around the maximally mixed state. A state is separable
if
∥a∥2+∥b∥2+∥TAB∥2≤1
3. (25)
This relation defines a ball of separable states of radius
1/√
3 around the origin, shown in blue in Fig. 3.
But this is not the largest separable set, i.e., a set
where only separable states are mapped to. In fact, the
inequality
∥TAB∥≤⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩√
1
6(2−3(∥a∥+∥b∥)2) ∥ a∥+∥b∥≤2
3
1−∥a∥−∥b∥2
3<∥a∥+∥b∥≤1
∥a∥+∥b∥−1 1 <∥a∥+∥b∥.
(26)
is a sufficient condition for the separability of a state and
the strongest sufficient condition formulated in terms of
∥a∥,∥b∥and∥TAB∥. A derivation of this inequality can
be found in Appendix A. This extended region is shown
in green in Fig. 3.
VI. MAXIMALLY ENTANGLED MIXED
STATES
When trying to maximize the entanglement of a state
under certain restrictions two families of states are of
particular interest. The first family consists of states
that maximize the entanglement for a fixed global pu-
rity, referred to as maximally entangled mixed states
(MEMS) [52–54]. For a two-qubit system they are of
the form
ρMEMS(x, θ)=x(∣00⟩⟨00∣+∣11⟩⟨11∣)+(1−2x−θ)∣01⟩⟨01∣
+θ/2(∣00⟩+∣11⟩)(⟨00∣+⟨11∣). (27)
The entanglement, quantified by the Wootters concur-
rence [55], becomes C(ρMEMS)=θfor these states. For 0 ≤
C(ρMEMS)≤2/3 it is maximized by x=1/3−θ/2 and in the
model the states have coordinates (1/3,1/3,√
2θ2+1/9).
For 2 /3≤C(ρMEMS)≤1 the states that maximize the6
FIG. 4. Maximally entangled states with respect to some pu-
rity constraint. The states maximizing the concurrence for a
given purity (MEMS) are shown in red, they start at the sepa-
rable region with the state ρ′and continue in a straight line to
the state ρ′′. Here they bend and continue (not in a straight
line) until the maximally entangled state. The states maxi-
mizing the concurrence for a given mixedness of the marginals
(MEMMS) correspond to the states on the boundary of our
model and are shown in orange.
concurrence are those with x=0 and have coordinates
(1−θ,1−θ,√
1−4θ+6θ2).
In Fig. 4 they are depicted in red, where three spe-
cial cases are highlighted: the state ρ′=ρMEMS(1/3,0)
is the only unentangled state of this family located at
the boundary of the separable region. The state ρ′′=
ρMEMS(0,2/3)connects the two different pieces and inci-
dentally also sits on the boundary of the entangled re-
gion. Finally the state ρMEMS(0,1)=∣ϕ+⟩⟨ϕ+∣maximizes
the overall entanglement.
The other family of interest are maximally entangled
states with fixed marginal mixedness (MEMMS) [56, 57].
That is, they maximize the two-qubit concurrence [55]
for given local Bloch lengths ∥a∥and∥b∥. The states inEq. (22) representing the upper boundary of our model of
the state space are exactly the MEMMS for two qubits.
They are shown in orange in Fig. 4.
VII. CONCLUSION
We have introduced a novel inequality that relates the
length of the local with global Bloch vector that is prov-
ably tight for qubits and provides deeper insight for qu-
dits. By visualizing the three relevant quantities we pro-
vide an instructive representation of physically relevant
properties in higher-dimensional state-spaces. Beyond
aesthetic and didactic value, we believe that such simple
relations will provide an important tool in the study of
complex many-body systems, where complete informa-
tion about the quantum state is unattainable for reasons
of both experimental and theoretical complexity. One
may expect that a deeper understanding of relations be-
tween sector lengths in multipartite systems may help
to derive physically relevant correlation constraints and
thus make the action of the quantum marginal problem
more transparent. The solution of the simplest case pre-
sented in this work gives a first indication of the path
toward that objective. While our inequality is not nec-
essarily tight in higher dimensions it remains a valuable
tool, and strengthening the inequality is an open problem
that will further broaden the application of this research
program.

Appendix A: Separability from Bloch lengths

∥a∥+∥b∥−1 1 <∥a∥+∥b∥
is a sufficient criteria for separability.
Note that through local unitary rotations the
marginals of every state can be diagonalized. That is,
after a local basis change every state can be expanded in
a Pauli product basis as

where aZ, bZ≥0.
Consider first the case aZ+bZ>1. We know that
cZZ≥aZ+bZ−1=∥a∥+∥b∥−1. Therefore states
satisfying ∥TAB∥=∥a∥+∥b∥−1 are diagonal and thus
separable. Now, recall that negativity under partial
transpose is a necessary and sufficient condition for two
qubits to be entangled and let ρΓbe the partial trans-
pose of ρ. Note that ∣ρ12∣=∣ρ34∣=∣ρ21∣=∣ρ43∣and
∣ρ13∣=∣ρ24∣=∣ρ31∣=∣ρ42∣and all remain unchanged un-
der the partial transposition. Hence ρ11ρ44≥∣ρ14∣2and
ρ22ρ33≥∣ρ23∣2are necessary and sufficient for positivity
after partial transpose, equivalently
(1+cZZ)2−(aZ+bZ)2≥(cXX+cY Y)2+(cXY−cY X)2
(1−cZZ)2−(aZ−bZ)2≥(cXX−cY Y)2+(cXY+cY X)2.Hence the stronger conditions

are sufficient for separability and finally also
∥TAB∥2≤1
2±cZZ+3

2(aZ±bZ)2(A2)
for both signs. Choosing cZZnegative we can just take
the positive sign. Minimizing over cZZgives cZZ=−1/3
foraZ+bZ≤2/3 and cZZ=aZ+bZ−1 for aZ+bZ>2/3, re-
sulting in ∥TAB∥≤√
1
6(2−3(∥a∥+∥b∥)2)and∥TAB∥≤
1−∥a∥−∥b∥respectively.
To see that this is indeed the optimal bound, choose
cZZ=aZ+bZ−1 and cXX=cY Y=ϵ/2. This state is
entangled for every ϵ≥0. For the case aZ+bZ≤2/3
takecZZ=1/3 and cXX=cY Y=1/9−(aZ+bZ)2/4+ϵ≤
1/9−(aZ−bZ)2/4, which is an entangled state for all ϵ>0.
