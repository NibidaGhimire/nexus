ABSTRACT
Porous acoustic absorbers have excellent properties in the low-frequency range when positioned in
room edges, therefore they are a common method for reducing low-frequency reverberation. However,
standard room acoustic simulation methods such as ray tracing and mirror sources are invalid for
low frequencies in general which is a consequence of using geometrical methods, yielding a lack
of simulation tools for these so-called edge absorbers. In this article, a validated ﬁnite element
simulation model is presented, which is able to predict the effect of an edge absorber on the acoustic
ﬁeld. With this model, the interaction mechanisms between room and absorber can be studied by
high-resolved acoustic ﬁeld visualizations in both room and absorber. The ﬁnite element model
is validated against transfer function data computed from impulse response measurements in a
reverberation chamber in style of ISO 354. The absorber made of Basotect®is modeled using the
Johnson-Champoux-Allard-Lafarge model, which is ﬁtted to impedance tube measurements using the
four-microphone transfer matrix method. It is shown that the ﬁnite element simulation model is able
to predict the inﬂuence of different edge absorber conﬁgurations on the measured transfer functions
to a high degree of accuracy. The evaluated third-octave band error exhibits deviations of 3:25 dB to
4:11 dB computed from third-octave band averaged spectra.

1 Introduction
How humans perceive the acoustic quality of a room is one of the key usability criteria in carefully designed buildings.
For example, the indoor sound environment has an inﬂuence on human task performance [1]. Controlling the acoustical
properties of a room is of utmost importance for the perceived comfort in the room because negatively perceived
acoustic environments lead to increased distraction, concentration difﬁculties and reduced privacy [2]. The acoustical
quality, together with the visual quality, was found to be highly relevant for school performance due to the inﬂuence on
speech comprehension for elementary-school teachers [3] as well as for secondary-schools students [4]. Furthermore, a
necessity of well-planned acoustic measures for rooms is given by the fact that noise level is negatively correlated with
job satisfaction [5, 6].
A conventional approach to predicting the acoustic properties of a room is using geometrical acoustics, i.e., ray tracing
simulations and mirror sources [7, 8]. These methods can deliver accurate results for higher frequencies, although they
neglect wave phenomena such as diffraction, by assuming sound to propagate as rays. However, for low frequencies f
and/or small geometric dimensions d(i.e., for low Helmholtz numbers He= 2fd=c1), these methods deliver
incorrect results as the assumptions of ray tracing and mirror source methods are not fulﬁlled [7]. At the same time, low
frequencies often present a problem in room acoustic scenarios, due to long multi-exponential decay of low-frequency
(non-diffuse) room modes, which is present when evaluating, e.g., third-octave bands [9, 10]. The reason for the
multi-exponential decay can be found in interference and low modal density (i.e., few modes per frequency interval) [11].
To damp these unwanted modal reverberation tails, one acoustic treatment method employs porous absorbent material
placed in or close to the edges of the room, which are hence called "bass traps" or edge absorbers (EA) [12, 13]. This has
already been observed by Maa in 1940, who concluded regarding absorber placement, that "the most effective positions
are along the edges and especially at the corners" [14, p. 51], because of the acoustic pressure maxima. However, in
the case of porous absorbers, kinetic energy, related to the acoustic particle velocity , is transformed to heat and thus
extracted from the sound ﬁeld. This effect originates from the friction losses due to the particle movement of the air in
the viscous boundary layer in the absorber’s pores [15, Ch. 6.4]. Since the acoustic particle velocity in the corner of a
room is forced to zero, the positioning of porous absorbent material in the edge is preferable over the corner in order to
damp room modes that are pronounced along the edge absorber length [16]. This placement strategy was supported
by theoretical investigations of Waterhouse, who described the sound ﬁeld interference patterns in front of an inﬁnite
acoustically rigid edge analytically assuming inﬁnitely many diffusely (i.e., isotropically and incoherently) incident
planar sound waves [17]. However, as shown in [16], these interference patterns can be conﬁrmed by measurement in a
reverberation chamber (RC) only for frequencies whose wavelengths are smaller than approximately 1/3 of the longest
room dimension (in [16] this results in f125 Hz ).
Considering that conventional room acoustic simulation methods (such as ray tracing and mirror sources) are not able
to simulate the low-frequency range, where the wavelengths of the considered sound waves are in the same scale
as the room dimensions, they cannot be used to simulate the inﬂuence of edge absorbers for low frequencies. Thus,
numerical wave-based methods must be employed to properly model wave phenomena and the inﬂuence of edge
absorbers. The Finite Element Method (FEM) presents an appropriate tool and has been used to model low-frequency
room acoustics, as the following examples illustrate: In [18], a FEM simulation of a small studio is presented using a
commercial FEM code where acoustic absorbers were modeled using surface impedances. A two-dimensional FEM for
modeling the acoustic effect of micro-perforated panels has been presented in [19], where a dedicated ﬁnite element
type was introduced for modeling micro-perforated panels. This approach was extended to the acoustic ﬁeld in rooms
in three dimensions in [20]. Regarding time-domain FEM, a comparison between explicit and implicit methods for
room acoustics has been presented in [21] using frequency-independent ﬁnite impedance boundary conditions, and the
explicit solver was recently extended with locally reacting frequency-dependent impedance boundary conditions and
has been applied to a large-scale auditorium [22]. Recently, this model was used to investigate different planar absorber
conﬁgurations in a room [23]. However, to the authors’ best knowledge, there is currently no validated FEM able to
predict the inﬂuence of volumetric porous EAs with an equivalent ﬂuid model on the acoustic ﬁeld on a room, which is
the aim of this paper.
In the present work, the homogeneous Helmholtz equation solved by the FEM implemented in the open-source FE-
framework openCFS [24] is used to model the inﬂuence of different EA conﬁgurations on the acoustic pressure ﬁeld
in a reverberant room. For parametrizing the Helmholtz equation, the so-called equivalent ﬂuid model approach is
used [25] with the ﬁtting procedure published in [26, 27]. The FE model is veriﬁed by means of a mesh convergence
study and validated against impulse response (IR) measurements in the RC at TU Graz. The measurements used for
validation are documented in [28]. The new model addresses the lack of simulation models for porous room acoustic
EAs, which has been discussed in [13].
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the numerical model used to simulate the room acoustic properties
with and without different EA conﬁgurations. In section 3, the validation procedure containing a grid study and

comparisons to measurements is described. The ﬁeld results of the simulation model are presented in section 4. Finally,
section 5 discusses the main ﬁndings.
2 Simulation Model

The simulation model represents the cuboid RC of the Laboratory for Building Physics at Graz University of Technology
[29], which was emptied from any resonators and diffusers. The RC walls are made of steel reinforced concrete and the
edge lengths are lx= 8:34 m ,ly= 5:99 m , andlz= 4:90 m . The lower frequency limit for the gradually beginning
build-up of a homogeneous sound ﬁeld in the RC can be derived via the mode density N=f. With the extended

The same procedure has been used by Floss et al. (cf., e.g., [26] and [27, Ch. 3.1]), albeit they used the two-microphone
method in contrast to the four-microphone method for measuring rmeas(f). The initial values for the genetic algorithm
are obtained from the study of [36, Tab. 1] (Basotect®G+) and are listed in tab. 2. After initialization, the genetic

grid has been used, as depicted in ﬁg. 3, for which the FE formulation with Nitsche-type mortaring has been introduced
in [25] and implemented in the open-source FEM solver openCFS [24]. The frequency-domain FEM system is solved
with respect to the boundary conditions as introduced in eq. (3). To this end, the frequency range from 0 Hz to200 Hz
is quantized with frequency steps of 0:5 Hz.
3 Validation Procedure
The validation procedure of the FE simulation setup consists of a mesh-convergence study in order to verify the
convergence of the FE model [37], and a point-wise comparison of the FE simulation results to transfer functions (TFs)
obtained from IR measurements in the RC.
3.1 Veriﬁcation — Convergence Study
For the convergence study, four different meshes have been investigated, whose element sizes correspond to the
wavelengthatf= 200 Hz , i.e., the approximate element sizes were chosen as =3,=6,=9, and=12in both 
abs
and
air, as indicated in tab. 3. A crinkle clip view through the meshes is depicted in ﬁg. 3. To quantify the discretization
error, the relative frequency error measure ErrL2

In tab. 3, the approximate element sizes, number of elements per subdomain, and the total number of elements of
the different meshes are listed, as well as the respective computational cost (wall time and RAM1) evaluated on a

computation server (running 24 CPU2threads on server "RK10" with two Intel (R) Xeon X5690 (6x 3,46 GHz each)
CPUs) and the relative error measure ErrL2
rel;f.
For decreasing element sizes, the mesh study exhibits a convergence towards the analytically calculated mode frequencies
by means of a decreasing error measure, from ErrL2
rel;f= 1:324510 3for the=3-mesh toErrL2
rel;f= 4:481610 6
for the=12-mesh, as listed in tab. 3. However, the increase in accuracy does not justify the extensive increase by a
factor of approximately 64in wall time duration and a factor of 8in RAM demand comparing the =3-mesh with the
=12-mesh. Balancing computational cost and accuracy, it is determined that the decrease in numerical error from the
=6-mesh to the =12-mesh does not justify the increase in computational cost. Therefore, it is concluded that results
obtained with the =6-mesh are sufﬁciently accurate for the simulation purpose.

3.2 Validation — Point-Wise Comparison of Measurements and FE Simulations
The simulation is validated by comparing TFs obtained from the simulation results to those obtained from measuring
IRs for each of the four conﬁgurations depicted in ﬁg. 1b.
Measurement Setup. The measurements were carried out as part of [28] and have been set up following reverberation
time measurement requirements of ISO 354 [38] containing six microphone positions and two loudspeaker positions. A
class 1 certiﬁed 1/2” NTi Audio M2230 omnidirectional condenser microphone is placed at a height of 1:3 mat each
microphone position (see ﬁg. 4). The excitation signal is played back below fc= 120 Hz via a Mackie SRM1850
subwoofer [39] and above fcvia a Norsonic NOR276 dodecahedron loudspeaker [40]. During the measurement,
both loudspeakers are located at the positions LSP1 and LSP2, respectively, as shown in ﬁg. 4, with the subwoofer
on the ﬂoor and the dodecahedron loudspeaker at a height of 1:3 mdirectly above the subwoofer. The measurement
microphones and the speakers are connected to a laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad T14s) via an RME Fireface UCX audio
interface [41]. On the laptop, measurement control is performed using the ITA-Toolbox [42] in MATLAB.

The excitation signal is an exponential sinusoidal sweep with 2097152 samples played back in the frequency range
from 20 Hz to24 kHz atfs= 48 kHz resulting in a sweep length of T= 43:69 s. The IR of each of the twelve transfer
paths between the respective microphone and loudspeaker position is calculated by direct deconvolution of the recorded
signal with the exponential sinusoidal sweep. The Peak Signal-to-Noise-Ratio PSNR (fm), according to Lundeby [43],
averaged over all IRs in the relevant frequency range ( 20 Hzfm200 Hz ) is shown in ﬁg. 5. Subsequently, the IRs
are cropped to 30 s and transformed in the frequency domain to obtain the twelve TFs with a frequency resolution of
f0:03 Hz . Since both the subwoofer and the dodecahedron loudspeaker do not have a linear amplitude frequency
response (cf. [39] and [40]), the obtained TFs are equalized with the inverse amplitude frequency responses of these in
their corresponding playback frequency range.

FE Simulation Setup. The measurement setup was replicated in the harmonic FEM simulations by choosing xsrc
to be at the geometric center of the subwoofer loudspeaker at the loudspeaker positions LSP1 or LSP2 (see ﬁg. 4a),
as the focus lies on the low frequency range. These simulations were performed on the same computer ("RK-10") as
the grid study simulations, but were computationally more demanding: for example, using 22 CPU threads, EA1 with
source position LSP1 had a wall time of 1h 10m and RAM usage of 3580 MB. The other conﬁgurations show very
similar computational demand resulting in a total wall runtime of approximately 9.3h for all four EA conﬁgurations
and two source positions. The microphones are replicated by evaluation points (MP1 to MP6 in ﬁg. 4a), at which the
acoustic pressure is interpolated using FE basis functions (a so-called sensor array). This enables a direct comparison
between the TFs of simulations and measurements. The results of these evaluations are depicted in the appendix A,
where transfer functions obtained from (i) measurements and (ii) FE simulations of the four conﬁgurations, two LSP

Comparison of Measurements and Simulation Results. Due to disparity of frequency resolution between TF
measurements and simulations, further quantitative investigations are based on the third-octave band averaged spectra
Lp;meas(fm)of the measurements and Lp;sim(fm)of the simulations, where fmis the third-octave band center
frequency.
In ﬁg. 6, the TF from LSP2 to MP2 is depicted exemplarily for all conﬁgurations. In all subplots, a good agreement
between simulations and measurements is present, as the simulations lie in the 5 dB -interval around the measurements,
for all third-octave band center frequencies except 31:5 Hz and40 Hz in the conﬁgurations EA1, EA2, and EA3. For
the empty RC depicted in the bottom right subplot of ﬁg. 6, it is visible that in the third-octave bands above 80 Hz , the
empty RC has a larger sound pressure level than the conﬁgurations EA1, EA2, or EA3. Some amplitude deviation
between simulations and measurements is visible in the third-octave bands with the center frequencies 31:5 Hz to50 Hz :
A reason for this (potentially systematic) deviation is presented below.
To further quantify the concordance between simulations and measurements, the error measure ErrLpis deﬁned such
that

error measure ErrLpis evaluated for each LSP/MP-combination resulting in twelve error values per EA conﬁguration.
Averaging across LSP/MP-combinations for each EA conﬁguration results in the averaged error ErrLp.

be concluded that no systematic error is present which can be traced back to a speciﬁc source position. From ﬁg. 7 it is
clear that the FE model achieves the lowest error for the empty RC (bottom right subplot), where the averaged error
ErrLpis3:25 dB . For the different EA conﬁgurations, the averaged error increases in the following order: For EA1
the averaged error measure is ErrLp= 3:44 dB , for EA2 the averaged error measure is ErrLp= 3:55 dB , and ﬁnally
for EA3 the averaged error measure is ErrLp= 4:11 dB . However, EA3 still exhibits a reasonable error value smaller
than the5 dB -tolerance. Therefrom it is evident, that the FE simulations of the empty room and all EA conﬁgurations
are in good agreement with the measurements.

The FE simulation allows for a detailed investigation of the resulting simulated TFs in comparison with the respective
measured TFs, as visualized in ﬁg. 8. Figure 8 (a) shows the measured and simulated TFs from LSP2 to MP2 for
conﬁguration EA1. In ﬁg. 14, all other LSP/MP-combinations are visualized. In ﬁg. 8 (b), the measured and simulated

for the empty RC are depicted. The measured TF shows large ﬂuctuations for very low frequencies (i.e., below 20 Hz )
due to the measurement noise. All LSP/MP-combinations for the empty RC are depicted in ﬁg. 13.
9FE Model for Room Acoustic Edge Absorbers A P REPRINT
When comparing ﬁg. 8 (d) with ﬁg. 8 (a) it is visible, that the edge absorber conﬁguration EA1 damps frequencies
above approximately 60 Hz , due to the modes in this frequency range being less pronounced in the conﬁguration EA1
than in the empty room. A similar effect is visible when comparing conﬁgurations EA2 and EA3 in ﬁg. 8 (b) and
ﬁg. 8 (c), respectively with the empty room in ﬁg. 8 (d). In all subplots of ﬁg. 8, for the low frequency range (i.e.,
below approximately 80 Hz to100 Hz ), the room modes are clearly seperable. This is in line with the lower frequency
bound of the RC, as deﬁned in eq. (1). Above this frequency, the number of modes per frequency interval is too high
for individual modes being distinguishable. From the detailed comparison of measured and simulated TFs it can be
concluded that some deviations between measurements and simulations are present, however the general tendencies and
qualitative properties of the measurements are retained in the FE simulations with good agreement. Potential reasons
for the deviations are discussed below.
For the sake of completeness, in appendix A, the TFs of all individual evaluation positions are depicted for all
conﬁgurations, which allow a detailed comparison of FE simulation results and measurements. In general, considering
the intermediate conclusions above, it is visible, that the FE model is able to predict the modal characteristics of the
sound ﬁeld, especially for the low-frequency range of interest as well as the qualitative damping behaviour of the EA in
the high-frequency range.

Reasons for Deviations Between Measurements and Simulations. In general, two types of errors can occur be-
tween measurements and simulations. Firstly, frequency errors, which are visible in the low frequency range (i.e., below
80 Hz ) in all conﬁgurations, see ﬁgs. 13, 14, 15, and 16. These become visible because the frequency resolution of the
measurements is much higher than that of the FE simulations, and because of unmodeled effects such as the inﬂuence of
10FE Model for Room Acoustic Edge Absorbers A P REPRINT
the RC door. This problem is contained by introducing averaging over third-octave bands. Secondly, amplitude errors,
which stem from many reasons, including measurement inaccuracies and unmodeled effects. To account for these
errors, it is reasonable to introduce a tolerance band of, e.g., 5 dB in the third-octave averaged TFs depicted in ﬁg. 6.
The unmodeled effects are as follows: The RC’s walls, ﬂoor and ceiling are constructed from steel reinforced concrete,
which is not perfectly sound-hard in the low-frequency regime (in the sense of a homogeneous Neumann boundary
condition), as acoustic-structural interactions may be present. This was observed during the validation measurements
as acoustic emissions emerged from the RC to the surrounding. Thus, the overall stiffness in the FE system is higher
than in the real measurement chamber, and therefore the modal frequencies of the simulation are higher than the modal
frequencies in the measured TFs. To verify these considerations by means of an additional mechanically-acoustically
coupled FE simulation, material parameters (mass density and stress tensor) of the actual RC’s walls must be known,
but as they are not available, a veriﬁcation simulation is not possible at the moment.
However, apart from the slight modal frequency deviations discussed above, the FE model is able to predict the acoustic
TFs, between the loudspeaker and microphone positions used in the room acoustic measurements, for the empty room
as well as for the three edge absorber conﬁgurations.
4 Field Results
The validated FE model is used to obtain high resolution visualizations in the whole computational domain 
, including
both air and absorber domains for all conﬁgurations depicted in ﬁg. 1b. Figure 9 shows the acoustic pressure ﬁeld at
f= 66:5 Hz excited at LSP1 for all investigated conﬁgurations depicted in ﬁg. 1b.
In ﬁg. 9 (a), the pressure ﬁeld in the empty room is depicted, which exhibits the expected modal shape of a room mode
with the mode orders (nx;ny;nz) = (0;2;1)(see eq. (2)). Looking at ﬁg. 9 (b) and (c), the mode shape is distorted
and the amplitude is damped, and the conﬁguration EA2 exhibits qualitatively a better overall damping behavior as
EA1. Figure 9 (d) depicts the resulting pressure ﬁeld with conﬁguration EA3, which is similar to the result of the empty
RC (see ﬁg. 9 (a)), but the amplitude is damped signiﬁcantly. Overall, from ﬁg. 9, it can be seen that all edge absorber
conﬁgurations are able to damp the modal ﬁeld amplitude at 66:5 Hz signiﬁcantly, but EA1 and EA2 exhibit the best
modal distortion capabilities.

Additional ﬁeld results are shown in ﬁg. 10 and 11, in which the acoustic pressure ﬁeld excited at LSP1 is depicted at
f= 21:5 Hz andf= 104:0 Hz, respectively, for all investigated conﬁgurations. In ﬁg. 10, the pressure ﬁeld of the
(1;0;0)-mode is depicted. Comparing the empty room in ﬁg. 10 (a) with conﬁgurations EA1, EA2, and EA3 shows
that all EA conﬁgurations are able to damp the pressure amplitudes. Furthermore, comparing EA1 in ﬁg. 10 (b) with
both EA2 and EA3 in ﬁgs. 10 (c) and (d), it can be concluded that EA1 has a slightly better damping capability on the
pressure amplitude than EA2 and EA3. Figure 11 (a) shows the pressure ﬁeld of the (0;0;3)-mode in the empty RC.
Comparing EA3 in ﬁg. 11 (d) with EA1 and EA2 (ﬁgs. 11 (b) and (c), respectively), it is visible that EA3 has a worse
damping capability than EA1 and EA2.

In ﬁg. 12, the acoustic pressure ﬁeld is visualized only for regions 
abs;1and
abs;2as deﬁned in ﬁg. 1a, regardless of
the material. The volume ﬁlled with absorber material is marked greenish in the subﬁgures of ﬁg. 12. For the empty RC
depicted in ﬁg. 12 (a), no damping of the pressure ﬁeld is visible (this was already visible in ﬁg. 9 (a)). Looking at
conﬁgurations EA1 and EA2 depicted in ﬁg. 12 (b) and (c), respectively, it can be observed that the acoustic pressure is
damped in the volume parts ﬁlled virtually with absorber material. As visible in ﬁg. 12 (c), the air-ﬁlled backing volume
allows for a better wave propagation (i.e., higher acoustic pressure) than the absorber material, which is concluded from
the higher acoustic pressure in the backing volume than in the absorber. Looking at ﬁg. 12 (d) is can be observed that in
the absorber volume, the acoustic pressure is damped. But since very close to the edge a minimum of acoustic velocity
is present [17], it is expected that the porous material acting on the acoustic particle velocity is less effective than with
(i) a larger cross-section (i.e., EA1) or (ii) a placement which is not as close to the edge (i.e., EA2) is to be favored
above conﬁguration EA3.
To summarize, the FE result exhibits the typically reported behaviour of edge absorbers: while the empty room clearly
has a pronounced modal ﬁeld, in conﬁgurations EA1 and EA2, the modal ﬁeld is dampened signiﬁcantly. Less damping
is visible for conﬁguration EA3. This is in line with the ﬁndings reported in [13], where the edge absorber is described
as a damping element onto the room modes (i.e., a so-called "modal brake").

5 Conclusion
The presented FE simulation model for room acoustic edge absorbers using the JCAL equivalent ﬂuid model for porous
material is able to predict the sound ﬁeld at the validation measurement locations. The convergence of the FE simulation
model has been veriﬁed by comparing analytical eigenfrequencies with the results of an eigenfrequency analysis across
a grid study for an empty room. Thereby, it has been shown that a non-conforming second order grid with a mesh size
of=6at approximately f= 200 Hz achieves an error measure of ErrL2
rel;f= 8:671010 5, comparing analytically
and numerically obtained eigenfrequency values. It has been shown that the frequency error measure ErrL2
rel;fdecreases
with decreasing mesh size, from which it is concluded that the FE model converges to the analytical solution.
The FE simulation model has been validated against TFs obtained from IR measurements in the RC of the Laboratory
for Building Physics at Graz University of Technology. Investigating third-octave band averaged spectra, an averaged
spectral error measure ErrLp= 3:25 dB is achieved for the empty conﬁguration, from which it is concluded that the
empty RC can be modeled accurately by means of the FE simulation. Furthermore, the edge absorber conﬁgurations
EA1, EA2, and EA3 are modeled with averaged spectral error measures of ErrLp=f3:44 dB;3:55 dB;4:11 dBg,
respectively. Therefrom it is concluded, that the FE model is able to describe the pressure ﬁeld in the real RC both with
and without EA with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, an explanation of deviations between measurements and
FE results with respect to small modal frequency deviations is provided.
The ﬁeld results exhibit the typical behavior of edge absorbers which is a damping and distortion of the modal pressure
ﬁeld of the empty RC. This supports the empirical observations of Fuchs and Lamprecht [12] as well as Kurz et al. [13].
In addition, the validated FE model allows for visualizing the acoustic ﬁeld in the absorber geometry, which is hard to
achieve with measurements due to the non-negligible inﬂuence of the measurement equipment on the acoustic ﬁeld.
The validated FE model may be used to achieve more insights and understanding of the interactions between the porous
edge absorber and the sound ﬁeld of the RC by investigating the sound ﬁeld consisting of acoustic pressure and particle
velocity inside the absorber volume. These investigations can be supported by additional measurements of the pressure
ﬁeld in close proximity to the absorber in order to achieve a precise understanding of physical consequences of using
edge absorbers. In addition to that, an optimal edge absorber conﬁguration with respect to absorber placement or
required material may be achieved by topology optimization.
