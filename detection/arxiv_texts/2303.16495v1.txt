1 INTRODUCTION
Trust has been studied for decades under diﬀerent disciplin ary lenses, such as philosophy [10], social sciences [12],
and economics [3]. This has ledto a multi-layered perspecti veontrustand sometimes divergent conceptions of trust
in diﬀerent disciplines. In the social sciences, trust has b een deﬁned as the expectation of non-hostile behavior; in
thecontext of economics,trustis oftenconceptualizedthr ough game theory;in psychological terms,trustrepresents
cognitive learning from experiences, and philosophically speaking, trust is based on moral relationships between in-
dividuals[1].Researchers haveintroducedaccountsoftru stthatareappropriateininteractions betweenhumans and
machines [23],includingAI systems [16].Morerecently,re search onexplainable AI(XAI) has regarded trustas akey
motivationwhencreating moretransparent and interpretab leAI [28].
While there seems to be a consensus in the XAI community that t rust is a critical factor in human-AI interaction,
researchers have identiﬁed challenges in measuring trust i n the context of AI. For example, diﬀerent conceptualiza-
tions of trust exist that are not clearly distinguished from one another (e.g., appropriate trust [15], calibrated trus t

[22], warranted trust [16], or reliance [33]). These variou s conceptualizations may lead to diﬀerences in the opera-
tionalizationoftrust.Forexample, trustasanattitude shouldbeviewed asa psychologicalconstructandtherefore be
measured with questionnaires, whereas reliance as a behavior can be measured with observational methods such as
such as behavioral changes [38]. Moreover, researchers mos tly measure trust at a single point in time that does not
meaningfully capture the dynamics of trust development ove r time [25], and empirical studies often use proxy-tasks
ratherthanactualdecision-makingtasks[5]thatdonotnec essarilyimposeuncertaintyorriskthathasbeenproposed
as a prerequisite of trust [16]. Even if these challenges are addressed in the research design, AI-researchers who at-
tempt to measure trust have to resort to questionnaires or su rvey scales from other disciplines because a validated
questionnaire fortrustinAI doesnot exist.One frequently used scaleinXAI research is the TrustbetweenPeopleand
Automation (TPA) scale developed by Jian et al. [17]. However, as the TPA was initially designed to examine trust in
automation rather than trust in AI, researchers must rephra se the TPA items, such as "the system is dependable" to
"theartiﬁcialintelligence isdependable." Terminologic aldiﬀerences (e.g., usingtheword"AI" ratherthan"algori thm")

still measures what it was initially intended to measure. As a consequence, the psychometric quality of a scale (i.e.,
reliability and validity) mustbereevaluatedafter such ad aptations[11, 18].
Whileit has beenrecognized thatthese issues complicateth emeasurement of trustinAI,we identiﬁed a diﬀerent,
noteworthy, and often underappreciated challenge - the lac k of a theoretical consideration and potential distinction
betweentrustontheonehandand distrustontheother.Aﬁrstindicationofthisdistinctionwasprovi dedbySpainetal.

Jian et al. [17], but a two-dimensional construct consistin g of trust and distrust as distinct factors [44]. Preliminar y

trust.However, thisraises thequestionofwhether evidenc e ofa two-factorstructureissuﬃcient fortwodistinct and
independent dimensions oftrustand distrustor merelya res earch artifactcausedbyreverse-coded items.
The XAI community has provided important insights into how t rust in AI can be developed and maintained, but
distrust has been relatively understudied.1This ignores decades of research, which has been in a critica l discourse
on whether trust and distrust constitute the same construct at opposite ends of a continuum or should be treated
as separate constructs on two distinct dimensions. A notabl e exception is the work from Schelble et al. [39], which
appearedat theTRAIT2022workshopand partiallymotivated this positionpaper.
Our contribution to the TRAIT Workshop 2023 is threefold: Fi rst, we provide a concise but informative overview
of the theoretical discourse and the main arguments for dist rust as a distinct construct. Second, we critically discuss

2 TRUST AND DISTRUST: POLAROPPOSITES,ORINDEPENDENTCONST RUCTS?
According toLewicki et al.[25]there generally are twoconc eptualizationsof trust.
IThe uni-dimensional model,which treats trustand distrust as bipolar opposites,ranging from distrustto trust
[e.g., 17,35,41].
IIThe two-dimensional model, which argues that trust and dist rust are two distinctly diﬀerentiable dimensions
that canvaryindependently, each ranging fromlow tohigh [e .g., 14,25,29, 30,36,43].
Overthelast40years,therehavebeenadvocatesforboththe uni-dimensional andtwo-dimensional models.Inthe
following,we willintroduceand mainly focusontheargumen ts forthetwo-dimensional trustmodelas weview this
as theless established model.
The underlying question raised by these two models is whethe r it is conceivable that trust and distrust can exist
simultaneouslyandindependentlyorwhethertrustanddist rustaretwosidesofthesamecoin[7].Theuni-dimensional
modelsuggests thathigh trustequalslowdistrust,andlowt rustequalshighdistrust,implyingthatthemanifestation
oftrustisalwaysdependentonthemanifestationofdistrus t[7].However,fromtheperspectiveofthetwo-dimensional
model, distrust is more than the absence of trust, and vice ve rsa [20]. Thus, high trust does not automatically imply
lowdistrust,and thetwoconstructscan coexistsimultaneo uslyand independently.
Luhmann[29]isconsideredoneofthemaincontributorstoth etheoreticalfoundationforadistinctionbetweentrust
and distrust, and many later proponents of the two-dimensio nal model draw on his reasoning [14, 20, 24]. Luhmann
argued that distrust is associated with stronger emotional reactions than trust and reﬂects the negatively charged
human survival instinct, while trust is more calm and compos ed,rendering the two constructs distinct. Lewicki et al.
[24]furtherdevelopedthisideaandclaimedthattrustisba sedonmorepositiveemotionalresponses(e.g., hope,faith ,
conﬁdence)anddistrustonmorenegativeemotions(e.g.,fe ar,skepticism,cynicism),sotheymaynotjustbeatdiﬀeren t
ends of thesamecontinuum,butorthogonal[14].Based onthe seemotional diﬀerences, Lewicki et al.proposeda 2x2
frameworkwithtrustononey-axisanddistrustonthex-axis tocapturenotonlythepositiveandnegativeemotionsbut
alsothepotentialforhighandlowlevelsofeachconstructt ocoexistsimultaneously.Withinthis2x2framework,each
quadrantrepresentsonepossiblecombinationofthetwocon structs:lowtrust/lowdistrust(quadrant1),hightrust/l ow
distrust(quadrant2),lowtrust/highdistrust(quadrant3 ),andhightrust/highdistrust(quadrant4),witheachquad rant
characterizing a distinct relationship between the two con structs and diﬀerent challenges that go with it [24]. More
recently,neuroimaging studieshavesupportedthispropos eddiﬀerence intheemotionalmakeupoftrustanddistrust
byshowingthattrustismoreassociatedwiththebrain’srew ard,prediction,anduncertaintyarea.Incontrast,distru st
is associatedwith thebrain’s intense emotions and fear ofl ossareas, suggesting diﬀerent neurological processes [9] .
The two-dimensional model (i.e., the potential coexistenc e of trust and distrust) is also supported by ﬁndings that
attitudes can be ambivalent and possess both positive and ne gative components [34]. For example, smokers trying
to quit smoking may have both positive and negative feelings towards cigarettes, suggesting that positive and nega-
tiveattitudescancoexistsimultaneously[6].Thiscoexis tenceofapparentlycontradictoryemotionsallowsforamor e
complexview ofthetrustrelationship [25],acknowledging thattheremaybereasonstobothtrustanddistrustsimul-

that are the opposites of each other" [14, p. 42]. However, th ere are also inﬂuential contributions and compelling
arguments for the one-dimensional model. For example, Scho orman et al. [41] replied to the statement above that "if
they[trustanddistrust]areoppositesofeachother,there islittleaddedvaluetotreatingthemasseparateconstruct s"
[41,p.8].Theauthorsfurthernotedthatthereisnotheoret icallyorempiricallyviableevidencethattrustanddistru st
are conceptually diﬀerent and that researchers who studied distrust have merely reverse-coded measures of trust to
represent their measures of distrust [41]. This remark poin ts to a psychometric question, namely, whether the two-
factorsolutionfoundbySpainet al.[44]fortheTPAquestio nnaire byJian etal.[17],which ourpreliminary ﬁndings
conﬁrmed in the context of AI [31], is suﬃcient evidence for t he independent existence of distrust or whether it is
merely a research artifact.
3 DISTRUST: MERELY ARESEARCH ARTIFACT?
In psychometrics (i.e., a branch of psychology concerned wi th the theory and technique of measurement), there is
evidence thatuni-dimensional modelsare,attimes,mistak enlyconsideredmultidimensionalduetoerrorsorartifact s
of measurement [40]. In the following, we will illustrate ho w these errors and artifacts can be introduced into ques-
tionnaires.

However, past research has shown that so-called reverse-coded items can distort the factor structures of scales [32,
40,42,48],thusleading tofalseconclusions regarding the dimensionality and theoreticalstructureofa questionnai re.
Reverse-coded items, also called negatively worded items, are items worded opposite to the regular scale items (i.e.,
positivelyformulated),whichneedtobere-codedpriortod ataanalysis(e.g.,avalueoftwoonaLikert-typescalefrom

Theoretically,respondentswhoagreewitharegularitemsh ouldsimilarlydisagreewithareverse-codeditem.Asa

past research has cast doubt on this theoretical assumption . Respondents are likely to misinterpret or misrespond to
reverse-coded items [37],either byresponding carelessly or becauseof so-called reversal ambiguity [46].Participants
sometimes develop patterns of answering questionnaires ba sed on the ﬁrst few items they read (e.g., continuously
responding with the value four), which reduces their attent ion [40]. The resulting carelessness leads respondents to
overlook the negative wording of the reverse-coded items wh en ﬁlling out the questionnaire. Schmitt and Stuits [40]

line with what the researchers intended, which happens espe cially in cross-cultural research [47]. Finally, Kam et al.
[19] have highlighted that respondents with a neutral opini on on an issue are likely to choose answers towards a
scale’s midpoint and tend to agree with both the regular and t he reverse-coded items. Given that such respondents

In summary, using reverse-coded items in questionnaires ca n result in a two-dimensional scale structure due to
the agreement with both regular and reversed items for two re asons. On the one hand, this contradictory response
behaviorcanhappenduetomistakes bytherespondents (i.e. , careless responding), wherethewordingofthereverse-
coded items is intentionally or unintentionally ignored. O n the other hand, misunderstandings between respondents

not expect when designing the scale because they expect oppo site responses to the reverse and regular items, while
respondents agree or disagree with both types. As a result of these mistakes and misunderstandings, the regular and
reverse-codeditemswillloadontwodistinctconstructsin factoranalysis,notbecausetherearetwodistinctconstru cts

Returning to trust and distrust, it is possible that the two- dimensional structure of the TPA identiﬁed by past re-
search [44]and inourpreliminary ﬁndings [31]inthecontex tofAIis notnecessarilyevidence thattrustanddistrust
are two distinct constructs. Instead, it might indicate the presence of methodological artifacts inﬂuencing the mea-
surement ofsubjectivetrustinanAIsystem.Such cases have beenreportedoninpastHCIresearch andbeyond (e.g.,

4 DISCUSSION
Basedontheargumentspresentedhere,weconcludethatwhil eadistinctionbetweentrustanddistrustonatheoretical
level appears to be sensible, it is still to be determined if t rust and distrust genuinely are two distinct constructs tha t
canbemeasured independently orif theyare thesameconstru ct,artiﬁciallyseparatedduetomethodologicalissues.
A discussion regarding the role of trust and distrust is rele vant because members of the XAI community have
emphasized thata key motivationof XAI is to increasetrustof the user in a trustworthyAI (i.e., warrantedtrust) but
alsotoincreasethedistrustoftheuserinanon-trustworthyAI(i.e.,warra nteddistrust)[16].Whilewegenerallyagree
with this position, the question arises as to how a one-dimen sional model of trust can do justice to a simultaneous
increase in trustand distrustand the diﬀerence between hav ing low trust and distrust.A simplistic understanding of
trustmaynotcapturethecomplexityofpeoples’attitudest owardAI.Theargumentthattrustanddistrustcancoexist
simultaneouslyseems particularlyimportantin today’swo rld,where AI is becomingmoreand moregeneralized and
canperformmultipletasks(e.g.,foundationmodels).This increasedgeneralizabilityraisesthequestionofwhichta sks
totrustAIwithandwhichtodistrustitwith.Forexample,al argelanguagemodel(e.g.,ChatGPT)mightbetrustedto
write an email but distrusted to generate code or play chess. Consequently, there might be factors that contribute to
theincrease and decreaseof trust,butalsofactorsthatcon tributetotheincrease and decreaseofdistrust[24].A two-
dimensionalmodeloftrustseemsmoreappropriatetoaccoun tforthiscircumstanceandarguablyismoresensitiveto
such changes, astrustand distrustarenot mappedonthesame dimension.
If trust and distrust are distinct, eﬀorts to eliminate dist rust do not necessarily establish trust, and in that case,
it is necessary to examine whether the two constructs have di ﬀerent antecedents and consequences [7]. The XAI
community might want to give more attention to these diﬀeren ces, and future research could investigate how and if
thetwoconstructscanbemeasuredindependentlyintheAIco ntextandwhatrolemethodologicalfactorsplayinthis
regard.ResearchoutsideofanAIcontext[e.g.,2,7]attemp tedtoinvestigateiftrustanddistrustaredistinctconstr ucts
in experimental settings. XAI researchers could attempt th e same and examine how trust and distrust relate to one
another,aswellasifthetwoconstructscanpredictothersu bjectiveandobjectivemeasures relevant tothehuman-AI
interaction(e.g., reliance).
There still seems to be no conclusive answer as to whether tru st should be understood uni-dimensionally (with
trust and distrust at the two ends of a continuum) or two-dime nsionally (with distrust as a distinct and independent
construct). However, it is precisely for this reason that th is discourse should ﬁnd its way into the XAI community.
In this position paper, we outlined the theoretical argumen ts in support of a possible distinction between trust and
distrustwhileatthesametimeshowingthatthisquestionis notsimplyansweredbypsychometricsbutbytheoretical
considerationsthatfeedintoexperiments.TheXAIcommuni tyshouldregardtheseopenquestionsasanopportunity
