Abstract. Weintroduce an evolution model ` ala Firey for aconvexstone which tumbles
on a beach and undertakes an erosion process dependingon som e variational energy, such
as torsional rigidity, principal Dirichlet Laplacian eige nvalue, or Newtonian capacity.
Relying on the assumption of existence of a solution to the co rresponding parabolic ﬂow,
we prove that the stone tends to become asymptotically spher ical. Indeed, we identify
an ultimate shape of these ﬂows with a smooth convex body whos e ground state satisﬁes
an additional boundary condition, and we prove symmetry res ults for the corresponding
overdetermined elliptic problems. Moreover, we extend the analysis to arbitrary convex
bodies: we introduce new notions of cone variational measur es and we prove that, if such
a measure is absolutely continuous with constant density, t he underlying body is a ball.
1.Introduction
Aim of this paper is to propose a variational counterpart of F irey’s seminal result stating
that the fate of worn stones is that of becoming spherical [25 ]. Firey considered the
evolution problem satisﬁed by the support functions h(t,·) of a family of convex bodies
C(t) inR3, obtained when an initial convex stone C(0) tumbles on an abrasive plane and
undertakes an erosion process, in which the rate of wear is pr oportional to the density of
contact points with the plane per unit surface area, and also to the volume of the stone.
The mathematical formulation reads

whereaandbare positive constants, ν−1
tis the inverse Gauss map of C(t),G(t,·) denotes
the Gaussian curvature of C(t), and|C(t)|its volume. Under the assumption that C(0)
is smooth and centrally symmetric, and that, for some T >0, the evolution problem (1)
admits a smooth solution, Firey showed that actually T= +∞, that convexity and sym-
metry are preserved along the ﬂow, and that an ultimate shape must satisfy the following
geometric condition: in every direction its support functi onhand Gaussian curvature G
are proportional to each other. Precisely, denoting by νits Gauss map and by ca positive
constant, it satisﬁes
(2) h(ξ) =cG(ν−1(ξ))∀ξ∈S2.
Then Firey obtained the following symmetry result: if a smoo th and centrally symmetric
convex body in R3satisﬁes the equality (2), it must be a ball. Moreover he conj ectured
that, in dimension 3, the above results (often referred to as “convergence of solutions to a

round point”) should remain valid without the assumption of central symmetry; in higher
dimensions, this is also called the generalized Firey conje cture.
Firey’s vision of worn stones has inspired many deep develop ments up today, in both the
ﬁelds of evolution equations, and of convex geometry.
On the side of evolution equations, the parabolic problem in troduced by Firey, written in
terms of a parametrization of the boundary and up to a renorma lization, is nothing else
than the Gaussian curvature ﬂow. Such ﬂow has been intensive ly studied in recent years,
so that it is impossible to report the related literature. We refer to the recent monograph
[4] for an account about the Gaussian curvature ﬂow and more r eferences on it. Let us
just mention that nowadays a full resolution is available fo r both Firey’s conjecture and
its generalized version, the main steps of its history being the following: the existence of
a solution to the Gauss curvature ﬂow was proved in any space d imension by Chou [52];
the convergence to a round point was obtained in dimension n= 3 by Andrews [3], while
in higher dimensions it follows from a convergence result by Guan-Ni [29], combined with
a rigidity result by Brendle-Choi-Daskalopoulos [17].
On the side of convex geometry, the rigidity result by Firey i s related to more general
rigidity questions for convex bodies. In fact, condition (2 ) amounts to ask that a convex
bodyKhas the same cone volume measure VKas a ball (see Section 2 for the deﬁnition).
Accordingly, a generalized version of Firey rigidity probl em reads as follows: for Kbe-
longing to the class Knof convex bodies in Rn, and a ball B, investigate the validity of
the implication
(3) VK=VB⇒K=B.
In the above mentioned papers about the asymptotic behaviou r of the Gaussian curvature
ﬂow, it has been proved that (3) holds under the assumption th atKhas its centroid at
the origin [29, Proposition 3.3] or that Kis smooth and strictly convex [17, Theorem 6].
Looking at (3), one is led in a natural way to the more general q uestion whether the cone
volume measure determines uniquely the associated convex b ody. In particular, denoting
byKn
∗the class of centrally symmetric convex bodies in Rn, the question is whether, given
KandK0inKn
∗, it holds that
(4) VK=VK0⇒K=K0.
Therelevanceofthisquestionlies inparticularinitsconn ection withoneofthemajoropen
problems in convex geometry, namely the validity of the log- Brunn-Minkowski inequality:

,
andhK,hLdenote the support function of KandLrespectively.
Inequality (5), which is a strengthening of the classical Br unn-Minkowsi inequality, has
been proved in dimension n= 2 in [13], while it is currently open in higher dimensions (s ee
the recent paper [10] for an extensive survey about the state of the art in this topic, and
also our previous paper [22] for a related functional versio n). As shown in [13], proving
the log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality is equivalent to provi ng that, for every ﬁxed K∈ Kn
∗,
the minimization problem
(6) min/braceleftBig1
|K|/integraldisplay
Sn−1log(hL)dVK:L∈ Kn

is solved by Kitself. Moreover, it turns out that a solution K0to problem (6) exists and
is a critical set, in the sense that it satisﬁes the equality o f measuresVK0=VK. Hence the
connection with the implication (4). For n= 2, B¨ or¨ oczky-Lutwak-Yang-Zhang [13] proved
that such implication holds true, thus obtaining also the lo g-Brunn-Minkowski inequality.
To close the circle, the minimization problem (6) is not unre lated with the evolution
of convex bodies by their Gaussian curvature. Indeed, in the particular case K=B,
the integral in (6) is an entropy functional, ﬁrstly conside red by Firey, which decreases
along the Gaussian curvature ﬂow (and actually a suitable ge neralization of this entropy
monotonicity property is used by Guan-Ni to obtain (3) for bo dies with centroid at the
origin).
Inthisworkweattack thenewproblemofstudyingtheaboveto picswhenthevolumefunc-
tional is replaced by some variational energy, such as torsi onal rigidity, principal Dirichlet
Laplacian eigenvalue, or Newtonian capacity. These functi onals are object of study in
many problems of classical and modern Calculus of Variation s, such as isoperimetric type
inequalities, concavity inequalities, inequalities invo lving polarity. In many cases, the
behaviour of these functionals turn out to resemble that of t he volume functional, in
particular concerning the validity of inequalities of Brun n-Minkowski type (see [20]).
Thus, studying variational results ` a la Firey seems to be a v ery natural direction, which
is, to the best of our knowledge, completely unexplored. To p recise what we intend, let
us focus our attention in particular on the case of torsional rigidity. In the physical case
whenK⊂R2is the cross section of a cylindrical rod K×Runder torsion, its torsional
rigidityT(K) is the torque required for unit angle of twist per unit lengt h. From an
analytical point of view, when Kis more in general a n-dimensional convex body, its
torsional rigidity (often abbreviated as torsion) is given by
T(K) =/integraldisplay
KuKdx,
whereuKis the torsion function of K, i.e. the unique solution to the Dirichlet problem
/braceleftbigg
−∆u= 1 in int K
u= 0 on ∂K.
A classical result by Dahlberg [23] ensures that, for any K∈ Kn, the gradient of the
torsion function is well-deﬁned Hn−1-a.e. on∂K, and belongs to L2(∂K). Moreover, it is
also well-known that the Hadamard ﬁrst variation of torsion can be expressed through an
integral formula, which is the perfect analogue of the one va lid for volume, replacing the
surface area measure SKby thetorsion ﬁrst variation measure µK, deﬁned by
(7) µK:= (νK)♯/parenleftbig
|∇uK|2Hn−1∂K/parenrightbig
,
(νK)♯denotes the push forward through the Gauss map of K. By pursuing the analogy
with the case of volume, we are led to introduce the cone torsion measure ofK, as the
positive measure on Sn−1deﬁned by
τK:=hKµK,
wherehKdenotes the support function of K.
Relying on this new deﬁnition, it is natural to investigate t he rigidity question analogue
to the one of Firey, namely whether, for a given K∈ Kn
∗,
τK=τB⇒K=B.4 G. CRASTA, I. FRAGAL `A
In the setting of smooth convex bodies, the equality τK=τBamounts to ask that the
torsion function uKsatisﬁes, for some positive constant c, the boundary condition
|∇uK|2x·νK=cGKon∂K,
whereGKdenotes the Gaussian curvature of ∂K. Hence, the corresponding rigidity
problem consists in investigating symmetry of smooth conve x bodiesKsuch that the
following overdetermined boundary value problem admits a s olution:
(8)

−∆u= 1 in int K,
u= 0 on ∂K,
|∇u|2x·νK=cGKon∂K.
This problem is not covered by the very vast literature on Ser rin-type problems [53], as
the simultaneous presence of the support function and of cur vature in the overdetermined
boundarycondition is completely new; welimit ourselves to quotethepapers[15,26] about
overdetermined problems in which curvatures are involved.
In Theorem 3 we establish symmetry for problem (8), under the weaker assumption that
Khas its centroid at the origin. At present, we do not know if th e assumption on the
centroid can be removed. The proof of Theorem 3 is obtained by an ad-hoc combination of
diﬀerent inequalities, such as theSaint-Venant inequality for torsion, and theisoperimetric
inequality for the 2-aﬃne surface area (or alternatively, a n isoperimetric-type inequality
proved in [19] and Blasckhe-Santal´ o inequality).
In the setting of arbitrary convex bodies, the equality τK=τBcannot be formulated any
longer as a pointwise equality for the gradient of the torsio n function along the boundary;
it just tells the measure τKis a constant multiple of the diﬀuse measure on the sphere, i.e .
(9) τK=cHn−1Sn−1.
In Theorem 6 we establish symmetry for convex bodies with cen troid at the origin satis-
fying (9). We argue by adapting the arguments used in the regu lar case, but the proof is
moredelicate, as it involves the regularity properties of c onvex bodieshaving an absolutely
continuous surface area measure; in this respect, we heavil y rely on the results proved by
Hug in the papers [32–34].
Thesymmetry resultsdescribedsofar are related to many fur therquestions. Inparticular,
in the spirit of Firey’s work, it is natural to wonder whether the condition τK=τB
identiﬁesKas the ultimate shape of some ﬂow.
To answer this question, we imagine a new variational ﬂow for worn stones which tumble
on an abrasive plane and undertake an energy-based erosion p rocess. Namely, we assume
that the rate of wear is proportional to the density of contac t points with the abrasive
plane, nolonger per unit surfacearea measure as in [25], but perunit torsion ﬁrstvariation
measure; moreover, while in [25] the rate of wear is also take n to be proportional to the
volume, we take it to be proportional to the torsional rigidi ty.
Towrite explicitly theproblem, let C(t) represent the evolution in time of an initial convex
stoneC(0), and let σbe any small part of ∂C(t). The measure of the set of directions
for which the abrasive plane touches C(t) at points in σis given by Hn−1(νt(σ)), where
νtis the Gauss map of C(t). By a standard change of variables (see Proposition 7 (e)),
we have
Hn−1(νt(σ)) =/integraldisplay
σG(t,y)dHn−1(y),5
whereG(t,y) denotestheGausscurvatureof ∂C(t)atthepoint y. Recalling thedeﬁnitions
of surface area measure and of torsion ﬁrst variation measur e for the convex body C(t),
the above integral can also be written as
/integraldisplay
νt(σ)G(t,ν−1

νt(σ)G(t,ν−1

|∇ut(ν−1
t(ξ))|2dµC(t),
whereu(t,·) is the torsion function of C(t). Thus we see that, while contact points have
densityG(t,ν−1
t(ξ)) with respect to the surface area measure SC(t), they have density
G(t,ν−1
t(ξ))
|∇u(t,ν−1
t(ξ))|2with respect to the ﬁrst variation measure µC(t)in (7). We conclude that the
variational analogue of Firey’s problem when replacing vol ume by torsion reads as follows:
(10)

∂h
∂t(t,ξ) =−aT(C(t))G(t,ν−1

t(ξ))|2on (0,T)×Sn−1,
h(0,ξ) =h0(ξ) on Sn−1,
h(t,ξ)≤b on (0,T)×Sn−1.
As in Firey’s paper, we assume that C(0) is smooth and centrally symmetric, and that for
someT >0, the evolution problem (10) admits a smooth solution. Unde r this assumption,
Theorem 10 establishes that T= +∞, that convexity and symmetry are preserved along
the ﬂow, and that an ultimate shape has the same cone torsion m easure as a ball. The
proof relies basically on the Brunn-Minkowski inequality f or torsion due to Borell [8].
We remark that proving the existence of a unique smooth solut ion to problem (10) is an
interesting problem in parabolic ﬂows, which is beyond the s copes of this paper, and will
be object of further research.
To conclude, another question we wish to address is whether, by analogy with (4), for any
pair of convex bodies K,K0∈ Kn
∗, we have
(11) τK=τK0⇒K=K0.
Suchimplication is inturnrelated to thepossibility of str engtheningtheBrunn-Minkowski
inequality for torsion into a logarithmic Brunn-Minkowski inequality of the kind
(12) T/parenleftbig
(1−λ)·K+0λ·L/parenrightbig
≥ T(K)1−λT(L)λ∀K,L∈ Kn
∗,∀λ∈[0,1].
Indeed, by arguing as in the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [13], one can easily check that (12) is
equivalent to proving that, for every ﬁxed K∈ Kn
∗, the minimization problem
(13) min/braceleftBig1
T(K)/integraldisplay
Sn−1log(hL)dτK:L∈ Kn

is solved by Kitself; moreover, if the above problem admits solution K0, it must satisfy
the ﬁrst order optimality condition τK0=τK(cf. the proof of Theorem 7.1 in [13]).
The inequality (12) (or the implication (11)) is likely very challenging, and it should be
ﬁrst proved (or disproved) in dimension n= 2, see Section 6 for some related remarks.
To conclude, we point out that all the results discussed so fa r are valid also when torsional
rigidity is replaced either by the principal frequency of th e Dirichlet Laplacian, or (for
n≥3) by the Newtonian capacity. To some extent, this may lead to consider the analysis
ourvariational wornstonesmorerighteous, andtobelievet hatthecorrespondingparabolic
ﬂows and logarithmic inequalities are worth of further inve stigation.

framework of arbitrary centred convex bodies. In Section 5 w e relate the convex bodies
studied in the previous sections to new variational ﬂows. In Section 6 we give a few
concluding remarks about logarithmic Brunn-Minkowski-ty pe inequalities.
2.Cone variational measures and related representation form ulas
LetKnbe the class of convex bodies in Rnwith the origin in their interior. In particular,
we are going to consider convex bodies in Knwhose centroid
cen(K) =1
|K|/integraldisplay

coincides with the origin. Here and below, we indicate by | · |the volume functional on
Kn. We shall also consider the subclass Kn
∗of centrally symmetric convex bodies.
GivenK∈ Kn, we denote by hKandνKrespectively its support function and Gauss map.
By deﬁnition, if mis a measure on ∂K, its push-forward ( νK)♯(m) through the Gauss map
is the measure on Sn−1deﬁned by

We recall that the surface area measure SKand thecone volume measure VKare deﬁned
respectively by
SK= (νK)♯(Hn−1∂K), V K=hKSK;
moreover, denoting by |VK|the total variation of VK, it holds that

The name cone volume measure is motivated by the fact that, wh enKis a polytope with

(14) VK=/summationdisplay
i|∆(o,Fi)|δνi,
whereδνiis a Dirac mass at νiand ∆(o,Fi) is the cone with apex oand basisFi. In recent
years, this notion of cone volume measure has been widely stu died (see [5,11–14,28,38,
39,42,44–46,51,55,56]).
Let nowF(K) be one of the following variational energies: torsional ri gidityT(K), ﬁrst
Dirichlet Laplacian eigenvalue λ1(K), or Newtonian capacity cap( K) (the latter in dimen-
sionn≥3). We denote by uKthe corresponding ground state, deﬁned as the unique
solution in Ω = int Kto the following elliptic boundary value problems (in the se cond case
normalized so to have unit L2-norm):

It is well known that, by analogy with the case of volume, each of these functionals and its

We set the following:

K∈ Knwe associate the positive measure on Sn−1deﬁned byhKµK, beingµKgiven by
(15), and we denote it respectively by τK(cone torsion measure ), byσK(cone eigenvalue
measure) and byηK(cone capacitary measure ).
Let us point out that the terminology in Deﬁnition 1 is chosen to emphasize the analogy
with the case of volume, though this is somehow an abuse; inde ed, the analogue of the
equality (14) is clearly falsefor ourvariational funtiona ls, sincethey are not additive under
the decomposition of a polytope in Kninto cones with apex oand bases at its facets.
Let us also notice that the above representation formulas ca n be rewitten as integrals over

Remark 2.The cone variational measures introduced in Deﬁnition 1 are weakly∗con-
tinuous with respect to the convergence of convex bodies in H ausdorﬀ distance. Indeed,
ifKnconverge to K∞in Hausdorﬀ distance, the support functions of Knconverge uni-
formly to the support function of K∞, while the ﬁrst variation measures of Knconverge
weakly∗to the ﬁrst variation measure of K∞(cf. respectively [36, Thm. 3.1] for capacity,
[35, Section 7] for the ﬁrst eigenvalue, and [21, Thm. 6] for t orsion).
3.Rigidity results for smooth convex bodies
In this section we deal with overdetermined boundary value p roblems on smooth convex
bodiesK, for which the Gauss map νKand the Gaussian curvature GKcan be classically
deﬁned. Whenever no confusion may arise, we omit the index Kand we simply write
νandG. We denote by Ba generic ball, by B1the unit ball, and by ωnits Lebesgue
measure.8 G. CRASTA, I. FRAGAL `A
Theorem 3. LetK∈ Knhave its centroid at the origin, and boundary of class C2. Assume
that, for some constant c >0, there exists a solution to the following overdetermined
boundary value problem on Ω := intK:

ThenKis a ball.
The proof of Theorem 3 is based on the application of diﬀerent i nequalities for convex
bodies, some involving torsional rigidity and some others b eing purely geometrical. We
list them below:
(i) The Saint-Venant inequality for torsion [31,47]:

(iv) The Blaschke-Santal´ o inequality [6,48] for convex bo dies with centroid at the
origin:
(22) |K||Ko| ≤ω2
n,
with equality if and only if Kis an ellipsoid (see [40, Theorem 1′]).
Proof of Theorem 3 . We are going to obtain an upper bound and a lower bound for
the constant cappearing in the overdetermined boundary condition, start ing from two
diﬀerent expressions of it. For the upper bound we use inequal ity (i), while the lower
bound can be obtained by two diﬀerent methods: either by using the inequality (ii), or
by using the inequalities (iii)-(iv). We provide both metho ds because, as we shall see, the
ﬁrst one works to extend the result to Newtonian capacity, wh ile the second one works
for the ﬁrst Laplacian Dirichlet eigenvalue. Since the uppe r bound and the lower bound
turn out to match each other, we conclude that in particular S aint-Venant inequality (19)
holds as an equality, and hence Kmust be a ball.9

Theorem 4. LetK∈ Knhave its centroid at the origin, and boundary of class C2. Assume

The proof of Theorem 4 is similar to the one of Theorem 3; it is b ased on the following

a matching upper and lower bound for the constant cappearing in the overdetermined

To conclude the proof, it remains to show that the expression s at the right hand sides of
the lower bound (34) and of the the upper bound (35) coincide. Indeed in this case the

The validity of (36) is checked through some direct computat ions involving Bessel func-

4.Rigidity results for arbitrary convex bodies
In this section we drop any smoothness assumption and we deal with arbitrary centred
convex bodies having some cone variational measure equal to that of a ball.
Theorem 6. LetK∈ Knhave its centroid at the origin, and let τKbe its cone torsion
measure according to Deﬁnition 1. Assume that, for some posi tive constant c,
(44) τK=cHn−1Sn−1as measures on Sn−1.
ThenKis a ball.
The proof of Theorem 6 requires some preliminaries about con vex bodies which have abso-
lutely continuous surface area measure (or equivalently wh ich admit a curvature function);
we gather them in Proposition 7, relying on some results prov ed in [32–34].
We recall that, if a convex body Khas absolutely continuous surface area measure, by
deﬁnition there exists a unique non-negative function fK∈L1(Sn−1,Hn−1Sn−1), called
curvature function ofK, such that its surface area measure satisﬁes SK=fKHn−1Sn−1.
Equivalently, we have
V1(K,L) := lim
t→0+V(K+tL)−V(K)
t=1
n/integraldisplay
Sn−1hL(ξ)fK(ξ)dHn−1(ξ)∀L∈ Kn.
Below we follow the usual convention that ν:∂K→Sn−1is a possibly multivalued map
associating to every x∈∂Kthe unit vectors of the normal cone to ∂Katx.
Moreover, using the notations in the cited papers of Hug, we s et15
–M(K):= the set of points x∈∂Ksuch that∂Kis second order diﬀerentiable at x
(so thatν(x) is a singleton and G(x) is well-deﬁned as the product of the principal
curvatures);
– (∂K)+:= the set of points x∈∂Ksuch that there exists an internal tangent ball
touching∂Katx(so thatG(x) is ﬁnite);
– exp∗K:= the set of points x∈∂Ksuch that there exists a closed ball Bcontaining
Kwithx∈∂B(so thatG(x)>0).
Proposition 7. Assume that K∈ Knhas absolutely continuous surface area measure,
and letfKbe its curvature function. Then:
(a)Denoting by r1(ξ),...,rn−1(ξ)the generalized radii of curvature of ∂Katν−1(ξ),
namely the eigenvalues of D2hK(ξ)|ξ⊥, we have
(45) fK(ξ) =r(ξ) :=n−1/productdisplay
j=1rj(ξ)forHn−1-a.e.ξ∈Sn−1.
(b)Setting
R(K) :=M(K)∩(∂K)+∩exp∗K,
we have that Hn−1(∂K\R(K)) = 0, andνis a bijection from R(K)toν(R(K)).
If, in addition, fK(ξ)>0forHn−1-a.e.ξ∈Sn−1, then:
(c)ν(R(K))has full measure in Sn−1, i.e.Hn−1(Sn−1\ν(R(K))) = 0.
(d)After possibly removing a Hn−1-null set from R(K), for every ξ∈ν(R(K)),hK
is second order diﬀerentiable at ξ,x:=∇hK(ξ)∈R(K)andG(x)r(ξ) = 1.
(e)For every nonnegative function ψ∈L1(∂K,Hn−1∂K)it holds that
/integraldisplay
∂KψdHn−1=/integraldisplay
Sn−1ψ(ν−1(ξ))
G(ν−1(ξ))dHn−1(ξ).
Proof.The equality (45) is proved in [33, formula (2.8)].
Statement (b) is consequence of the facts that Hn−1(∂K\M) = 0,Hn−1(∂K\(∂K)+) = 0
andHn−1(∂K\exp∗K) = 0, following respectively from Alexandroﬀ theorem [2], [ 43],
and [34, Theorem 3.7(c)].
Assume now that fK>0Hn−1-a.e. onSn−1. Recall that the curvature measure of Kis
the measure CK, supported on ∂K, deﬁned by
CK(E) :=Hn−1(ν(E)) for every Borel set E⊆∂K.
By (45) and Theorem 2.3 in [34], it follows that CKis absolutely continuous with respect
toHn−1∂K. Since, by statement (b), the set ∂K\R(K) isHn−1-negligible, we con-
clude that also statement (c) holds, namely Sn−1\ν(R(K)) isHn−1-negligible. To prove
statement (d), we consider the subset of Sn−1given by
Σ :=/braceleftbig
ξ∈ν(R(K)):hKis second order diﬀerentiable at ξ/bracerightbig
,
and we replace R(K) with the possibly smaller set ν−1(Σ). Then statement (d) follows
from (c) and Alexandroﬀ theorem.
Finally, let us prove (e). Following [32], for every r>0 let (∂K)rbe the set of all points
ofx∈∂Ksuch that there exists an internal tangent ball of radius rtouching∂Katx.16 G. CRASTA, I. FRAGAL `A
From Lemma 2.3 in [32], the map ν(∂K)ris Lipschitz continuous, and its approximate
(n−1)-dimensional Jacobian is
apJn−1ν(∂K)r(x) =G(x),forHn−1-a.e.x∈(∂K)r.
Recalling that G(x)>0 forHn−1-a.e.x∈∂K, for every positive n∈Nwe can apply
Federer’s coarea formula (see [24, Theorem 3.2.22]) to the n on-negative function
hn(x) :=ψ(x)

applying Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem. /square
We are now in a position to give the
Proof of Theorem 6. The idea is to follow the same proof line of Theorem 3. However ,
this cannot be done directly, since we do not have any longer a pointwise identity holding
along the boundary. So, we have to prove ﬁrst of all that the co nstantcappearing in (44)
can be still expressed by the two diﬀerent formulas (24) and (2 6). To obtain formula (24),
it is enough to observe that the two measures in the overdeter mined conditions must have
the same total variation: using (16), we obtain
|τK|= (n+2)T(K),
and hence
c=|τK|
Hn−1(Sn−1)=n+2
nωnT(K).
To obtain also formula (26), we need ﬁrst to prove the followi ng
Claim:the equality (44)implies that Khas absolutely continuous surface area measure,
and in addition its curvature function is strictly positive .
This amount to show that, if the equality (44) holds, for a Bor el setE⊂Sn−1, the
following implications hold:
(46) Hn−1Sn−1(E) = 0⇒SK(E) = 0;
(47) Hn−1Sn−1(E)>0⇒SK(E)>0.
Indeed,(46)impliesthat Kadmitsacurvaturefunction fK; then,since SK=fKHn−1Sn−1,
(47) implies that fKis strictly positive Hn−1-a.e. onSn−1.
LetE⊂Sn−1be a Borel set with Hn−1Sn−1(E) = 0. By (44), we have τK(E) = 0.
Recalling that, by deﬁnition, we have
(48) τK(E) =/integraldisplay
ν−1(E)|∇u|2x·νdHn−1,
and
SK(E) =Hn−1(∂K∩ν−1(E)),
the implication (46) follows from the fact that
|∇u|2x·ν >0Hn−1-a.e. on∂K.17
Indeed, theterm x·νremains strictly positive sinceby assumption Kcontains the origin in
its interior, while the term |∇u|2remains strictly positive by Hopf boundary point lemma
(sinceKadmits an inner touching ball at Hn−1-a.e.x∈∂K, see e.g. [43]).
LetE⊂Sn−1be a Borel set with Hn−1Sn−1(E)>0. From (44), it follows that
τK(E) =cHn−1(E)>0. In turn, by (48), this implies that Hn−1(ν−1(E))>0, or
equivalently that SK(E)>0, proving (47).
Since we have just proved that Kadmits a positive curvature function fK, recalling also
the deﬁnition of cone torsion measure τK, the equality (44) can be reformulated as
hKν♯(|∇u|2Hn−1∂K) =c
fKν♯(Hn−1∂K).
Namely, for every Borel set E⊂Sn−1, it holds that
(49)/integraldisplay
ν−1(E)x·ν|∇u|2dHn−1=c/integraldisplay

fK◦νdHn−1.
We now invoke Proposition 7. By statements (a) and (d), we can rewrite the right hand
side of the above equality as
/integraldisplay

fK◦νdHn−1=/integraldisplay
ν−1(E)GdHn−1,
so that (49) turns into
(50)/integraldisplay
ν−1(E)x·ν|∇u|2dHn−1=c/integraldisplay

By Proposition 7, statements (b) and (c), we know that νR(K) is a bijection from R(K)
toν(R(K)), withHn−1(∂K\R(K)) = 0 and Hn−1(Sn−1\ν(R(K))) = 0. In view of this
fact, the integral equality (50) yields the pointwise equal ity
|∇u|=c1/2/parenleftbiggG(x)
x·ν(x)/parenrightbigg1/2
Hn−1-a.e. on∂K.
Integrating over ∂K, we see that (26) holds.
Having established the validity of (24) and (26), the remain ing of the proof can proceed in
theanalogous way as inTheorem3. Indeed, theinequalities u sedintheproofofTheorem3
do not need any smoothness assumption. In particular, for th e 2-aﬃne isoperimetric
inequality for convex bodies which admit a curvature functi on, we refer to [38, Theorem 3]
(see also [32, Remark p. 296]). /square
As well as the inequalities used in the proof of Theorem 3, als o the inequalities used in
the proof of Theorems 4 and 5 do not need any smoothness assump tion. Thus we obtain
the following results for convex bodies with the same cone ei genvalue measure or the same
cone capacity measure as a ball. We omit their proofs since th ey are analogous to the one
of Theorem 6 detailed above.
Theorem 8. LetK∈ Knhave its centroid at the origin, and let σKbe its cone eigenvalue
measure according to Deﬁnition 1. Assume that, for some posi tive constant c,
σK=cHn−1Sn−1as measures on Sn−1.

5.Ultimate shapes of variational flows
In this section we show that, in the smooth centrally symmetr ic setting, the convex bodies
analysed in Section 3 can be identiﬁed with the ultimate shap es of new variational ﬂows,
under the basic assumption that they admit a solution. We pre sent a uniﬁed treatment,
by considering the evolution problem
(51)

∂h
∂t(t,ξ) =−aF(C(t))G(t,ν−1
t(ξ))
|∇u(t,ν−1
t(ξ))|2on (0,T)×Sn−1,
h(0,ξ) =h0(ξ) on Sn−1,
h(t,ξ)≤b on (0,T)×Sn−1.
whereFmay denote either the torsional rigidity, or the principal D irichlet Laplacian
eigenvalue, or the Newtonian capacity (the latter for n≥3), anduis the corresponding
ground state.
Let us remark that, in terms of the parametrization of ∂C(t) by its inverse Gauss map
X(t,·) :Sn−1∋ξ→ν−1
t(ξ)∈∂C(t), the evolution equation in (51) can be written as
∂X
∂t(t,ξ) =−G(t,X)
|∇u|(t,X)2F(C(t))ξon (0,T)×Sn−1
(indeed, we have h(t,ξ) =ν−1
t(ξ)·ξ, so that∂h
∂t(t,ξ) =∂X
∂t(t,ν−1
t(ξ))·ξ).
Thus, up to the factor F(C(t)) (which is just a rescaling allowing to have global existen ce
in time), the unique crucial diﬀerence bewteen (51) and the cl assical Gaussian curvature
ﬂow is the presence of the squared modulus of the ground state gradient.
We denote by αthe homogeneity degree of Funder domain dilations (see Section 4).
The following statement deals with the cases of torsion and ﬁ rst eigenvalue, see however
Remark 11 for the case of capacity.
Theorem 10. LetF=TorF=λ1. Assume that, for some T >0, there exists a unique
family of convex bodies C(t), deﬁned for t∈[0,T), which are smooth (at least of class C3)
and such that their support function ξ/ma√sto→h(t,ξ)satisﬁes (51). Then, setting γ=anωn
|α|,
(i)it holds that F(t) =F0exp(−γt), whereF0is the energy at t= 0; in particular,
the familyC(t)is strictly decreasing by inclusion;
(ii)the ﬂow is deﬁned for every t≥0(i.e.,T= +∞), and the sets C(t)are strictly
convex bodies;
(iii)the following entropy is decreasing along the ﬂow:
E(t) :=/integraldisplay
Sn−1logh(t,ξ)dHn−1(ξ)+γnωnt;
(iv)assuming in addition that C(0)is centrally symmetric, we have that C(t)is cen-
trally symmetric for every t≥0; moreover, if {tn} →+∞, up to subsequences
exp(γtn)C(tn)converge in Hausdorﬀ distance to a centrally symmetric conv ex
body, called an ultimate shape for problem (10), whose cone torsion measure or19
cone eigenvalue measure is absolutely continuous with resp ect toHn−1Sn−1, with
constant density.
Remark 11.As it can be seen by direct inspection of the proof below, for F= cap, thanks
to the Brunn-Minkowski inequality proved in [7], statement (i) continues to hold, but in
principle statement (ii) may fail, because the positivity o f the capacity does not imply
that the corresponding convex body is nondegenerate. Howev er, if it occurs that the ﬂow
is deﬁned for all times, then also statements (iii)-(iv) hol d true.

where we have set /tildewideF1(t+s,t) :=F1(/tildewideC(t+s),/tildewideC(t)). Then, using (52) in a similar way as

which shows that

By combining (54) and (56), we see that /tildewideF(t) is equal to a constant, precisely to F0:=
/tildewideF(0) =F(0), and hence
F(t) =F0exp(−αγt).
SinceF(t)>0 for every t∈[0,T), from the equation we see in particular that the family
of convex sets C(t) is strictly decreasing with respect to t.

(the ﬁrst one is the Saint-Venant inequality (19), while for the second one we refer e.g. to
[18, Proposition 11]). It follows that C(t) is a nondegenerate convex body for every t, and
hence that T= +∞. The strict convexity of C(t) follows from the strict positivity of its
Gaussian curvature resulting from the equation.

Byinterchangingderivativeandintegral on Sn−1, weobtainthattheentropy E(t)decreases

(iv) The central symmetry of C(t) corresponds to the condition h(t,ξ) =h(t,−ξ), which
is satisﬁed since the map h(t,ξ) is a solution to problem (51), and by assumption such
problems admits a unique solution. Now, integrating on [0 ,t] the inequality E′≤0, we
obtain
E(t) =/integraldisplay
Sn−1log/tildewideh(t,ξ)dHn−1(ξ)≤/integraldisplay
Sn−1log/tildewideh0(ξ)dHn−1(ξ) =E(0).
By exploiting the central symmetry of /tildewideC(t) this implies, by arguing as in [25, proof of
Thm. 2], that the convex bodies /tildewideC(t) lie into some ﬁxed ball independent of t; moreover,
applying the inequalities (57) it follows that, for every t≥0,/tildewideC(t) contains a ﬁxed ball
centered at the origin. So there exist R>r> 0 independent of tsuch that
(58) Br(0)⊆/tildewideC(t)⊆BR(t)∀t∈[0,+∞).
In particular this implies that the monotone decreasing map E(t) is bounded from below,
and so it converges to a ﬁnite limit as t→+∞; thus we have

and hence by (59) we have that g(t,ξ)→1Hn−1-a.e. on Sn−1ast→+∞. By (58),
the support functions /tildewideh(t,·) are bounded from above and from below on Sn−1by positive
constants independent of t. It follows that
(60) lim
t→+∞∂/tildewideh
∂t(t,ξ) = 0 Hn−1-a.e. onSn−1.
Take now a sequence {tn} →+∞. By (58) and by the compactness of the Hausdorﬀ
distance,/tildewideC(tn) converges to a nondegenerate convex body /tildewideC∞. Then the cone variational
measuresof/tildewideC(tn) converge weakly* to theconevariational measureof /tildewideC∞(see Remark 2).
Thus, if we set
ψn(ξ) :=|∇/tildewideu(tn,/tildewideν−1
tn(ξ))|2
/tildewideG(tn,/tildewideν−1
tn(ξ))/tildewideh(tn,ξ)
we have that ψnconverge weakly in L1(Sn−1,Hn−1Sn−1) toψ∞, beingψ∞the density
of the cone variational measure of /tildewideC∞.22 G. CRASTA, I. FRAGAL `A
On the other hand, by passing to the limit as n→+∞in the equation (55) written at
t=tn, recalling that F(tn) =F0, and exploiting (60), we obtain the following pointwise
convergence
(61) lim
nψn(ξ) =a

Moreover, we have

(see respectively [21, eq. (23)] for torsion, [36, eq. (3.15 )] for capacity and [35, Section 7]
for principal eigenvalue), so that ψnconverge to ψ∞strongly in L1(Sn−1,Hn−1Sn−1).
In particular, from (61) we conclude that ψ∞=a
γF0, namely the cone variational measure
of/tildewideC∞is a constant multiple of Hn−1Sn−1. /square
6.Concluding remarks
Remark 12.In dimension n= 2 and for Ksmooth, the existence of a solution to the log-
arithmic Minkowski problem (13) easily follows from the res ults proved in [13, Section 6].
Indeed, it is not restrictive to assume T(K) = 1 and to minimize over convex bodies with
unit torsion. Let {Lj}be a minimizing sequence. By arguing as in the proof of Lemma
6.2 in [13], it is possible to ﬁnd a sequence of origin-symmet ric parallelograms {Pj}, with
T(Pj) = 1 and orthogonal diagonals, such that Pj⊆Lj⊆2Pj. If{Lj}is not bounded, we
have that also {Pj}is not bounded; moreover, by the assumption T(Lj) = 1, the mono-
tonicity of torsion by inclusions, and Saint-Venant inequa lity (19), the volume of Pjis
bounded from below by a positive constant independent of j. Then we can apply Lemma
6.1 in [13] to infer that the sequence/integraltext
S1loghPjdVKis not bounded from above. Since
by Hopf’s boundary lemma |∇uK|2has a strictly positive minimum on ∂K, this implies
that also the sequence/integraltext
S1loghLjdτKis not bounded from above, contradicting the fact
that{Lj}is a minimizing sequence. Hence, {Lj}remains bounded, and by Blaschke’s
selection theorem we may select a converging subsequence; i ts limit turns out to be an
origin symmetric convex body with unit torsion which solves problem (13).
Remark13.Inany space dimension, for K=Bthe logarithmic Minkowski problem(13) is
solved uniquely by the ball. Namely, using for brevity the no tationτBfor the normalized
cone torsion measure, i.e. τB:=τB/T(B), we have

Remark 14.In dimension n= 2, the logarithmic Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the ﬁrs t
eigenvalue and for the torsion can be easily tested on the cla ss of rectangles. For any
x>0, setRx= (0,x)×(0,1). Givenℓ1,ℓ2>0, andλ∈(0,1), we have
