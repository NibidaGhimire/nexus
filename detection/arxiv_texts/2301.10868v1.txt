Abstract  
 
A levitated non -spherical nano particle in a vacuum is ideal for studying quantum rotations and is  
an extremely sensitive torque and force detector . It has been pr oposed to probe fundamental 
particle -surface interactions such as the Casimir torque and the rotational quantum vacuum 
friction, which require it to  be driven to rotate near a  surface at sub -micrometer separations . 
Here, we optically levitate a silica nano dumbbell in a vacuum at about 430  nm away from  a 
sapphire surface and drive it to rotate at GHz frequencies . The relative linear speed  between the 
tip of the nanodumbbell and the surface reaches 1.4 km/s at a sub -micrometer  separation. The 
rotating nanodum bbell near the surface demonstrates a torque sensitivity of  (5.0¬±1.1)√ó
10‚àí26NmH z‚àí1/2 at room temperature . Moreover, we levitate a nanodumbbell near a gold 
nanograting and use it to probe the near -field intensity distribution  beyond the optical diffraction 
limit . Our numerical simulation shows it is promising to detect the Casimir torque between a 
nano dumbbell and a nanograting .  
 
Introduction  
Recently, quantum  ground state cooling of the cent er-of-mass (CoM) motion of an opti cally 
levitated  nanosphere in a vacuum was achieved (1-4), showing the great potential of l evitated 
nanoparticle s for  study ing macroscopic quantum mechanic s (5, 6 ). Meanwhile, levitated 
dielectric particles in a vacuum are ultrasensitive force detectors (7, 8), and their CoM motion 
has been proposed to detect short -range forces (9-15), dark matter (16), dark energy (17), high -
frequency gravitational wave (18, 19 ), and quantum effects in gravity (20, 21 ). Besides the CoM 
motion  (22-24), there is increasing interest in the torsional  (25, 26 ) and rotational motion s (27-
32) of birefringent (27, 29 ) and non -spherical par ticles (33-36). Levitated non-spherical 
nanoparticles in free space have been driven to rotate at GHz frequencies (36-39), and cooled by 
active feedback (40, 41 ), coherent scattering (42, 43 ), and spin -optomechanical interaction (44-
47). Theoretical investigations have predicted intriguing quantum revivals (48) and quantum 
persistent tennis racket dynamics (49) of nanorotors. In addition, a levitated non-spherical 
nanoparticle in a vacuum is an ultrasensitive torque detector (25, 34, 38 ) thanks to its high 
quality factor and small moment of inertia. It is a rare system that can detect the Casimir torque 
due to quantum vacuum fluctuations (50, 51 ) and the long -sought quantum vacuum friction (52-2 
 56). However, such applications require a nanoparticle to be driven to rotate near a  surface at 
sub-micrometer separations in a vacuum , which has not been demonstrated yet .   
 
In this article, we optically levitate a nanodumbbell (36, 38 ) at a sub -micrometer se paration from 
a surface for the first time, and drive it to rotate at GHz frequencies near the surface. Despite the 
small particle -surface separation, we achieve stable GHz rotation of a nanodumbbell near a 
surface without external feedback cooling. The s tanding wave formed near the surface due to 
surface reflection provides stronger spatial confinement than the optical tweezers in free space, 
which helps to stabilize the trapping . The silica nanodumbbell consists of two nanospheres with 
diameters of 144 nm. In the first stable trapping well  near the surface , which is about 430  nm 
away from the sapphire surface, we drive a silica nanodumbbell to rotate up to  1.6 GHz  in a high 
vacuum . This mechanic al rotation corresponds to a linear speed  of 1. 4 km‚ãÖs‚àí1 at the tip of the 
nanodumbbell  relative to the surface . Such a record -high relative speed at a sub-micro meter  
separation  will be ideal for detecting the long -sought quantum vacuum fricti on (52-56). 
 
In the experiment, we measur e the torque sensitivity and three -dimensional force sensitivity of a 
nanodumbbell  levitat ed near a sapphire  surface . The  nanodumbbell near the surface demonstrates 
a torque sensitivity of (5.0¬±1.1)√ó10‚àí26NmH z‚àí1/2 at 6.1√ó10‚àí5 Torr  at room temperature.  
Compared to  the free space  case, the nanodumbbell maintains its high torque and force 
sensitivity when it is levitated near the surface  in a vacuum . Thus, a levitated nanoparticle near a 
surface will be ideal for investigating fundamental particle -surface interaction s and other near -
field effects. As an example of potential applications, we levitate a nanodumbbell in the first 
trapping well near a gold nanograting with a stripe width of 300 nm and detect the near -field 
interference pattern of the laser beyond the opti cal diffraction limit. In contrast, the effects of the 
near-field interference is negligible when the nanodumbbell is trapped in the second well that is 
about 1.2 Œºm from the nanograting.  
In addition,  we calculate  the Casimir torque on a nanodumbbell levitated near a nanograting, 
which polarizes nearby quantum vacuum fluctuations (50, 57, 58 ). The calculated Casimir torque 
can be more than 10‚àí24Nm under realistic conditions. Thus, our system will be sensitive enough 
to measure the Casimir torque. Our work is an important development in levitated 
optomechanics.  It shows a levitated nanodumbbell near a surface in a vacuum will be able to 
probe surface interactions with ultrahigh torque and force sensitivities that are not achievable 
with conventional atomic force microscopes .  
 
GHz rotation near a surface  
In the experiment, we first levitate a  silica  nanod umbbell  with a tightly focused 1550  nm laser  in 
free space (See supplementary Fig. S1 for more details). The laser power at the trapping region is 
about 200 mW.  The nanodummbell is composed of two silica nanospheres with a diameter of 
144 nm. With a linea rly-polarized trapping laser, we measure the power spectrum density (PSD) 
of the trapped nanodumbbell at 10 Torr to verify its geometry. The typical PSD of a trapped 
nanodumbbell shows  a large  torsional peak . The measured damping rate ratio of the CoM motion  
perpendicular and parallel to  the electric field is close to  1.27 for a nanodumbbell (36).

trapping potential for a nanodumbbell levitated near the sapphire surface in the unit of kBT (T = 300 K). 
Discrete trapping wells are formed due to the standing wave effect near the surface. The trapping position

rotational signal of a nanodumbbell trapped in the first well near the sapphire surface . The peak near 3.2 
GHz corresponds to a mechanical rotation frequency of 1.6  GHz at the pressure of 5.9√ó10‚àí5 Torr . The 
inset figure shows the measured rotation frequency as a function of pressure (blue dot) and a fitting curve 
(solid red line) proportional to 1/ùëÉ. (E) PSDs of a nanodumbbell trapped in the first well near the 
sapphire surface (top) and in free space  (bottom) at 1.5 Torr. The trapping laser is linearly polarized. The 
oscillation frequencies of the CoM (Red) and torsional (Blue) motions in the first well are significantly 
larger than those in free space. (F) Enhancement ratios of the trapping  frequenci es of optical tweezers 
near a sapphire surface over those in free space as a function of the distance of the trap from the sapphire 
surface. Red dots and blue squares are measured enhancement ratios for X and Y CoM motions,  
respectively. The simulation re sults (black diamonds) are calculated based on the simulated trapping 
potential shown in (B).   
 
Once the geometry of the nanodumbbell is confirmed in the free space optical trap, we use a high 
voltage source to create air discharge to neutralize the nanodu mbbell (supplementary Fig. S2). 
After neutralization, a  sapphire surface  is inserted perpendicular ly to the axis of the trapping 
laser , and the nanodumbbell will be trapped near the sapphire surface (Fig.  1(A)). The partly 
reflected laser from the surface interferes with  the original tra pping laser  and form s a partial 
standing wave . This  creates discrete trapping wells near the sapphire surface, as shown in Fig. 
1(B) and 1(C) . The nanodumbbell  near the sapphire surface is trapped in one of the trapping  
wells. By controlling the surface position along the z direction before inserting the sapphire 
4 
 substrate, we can load the nanodumbbell into different trapping wells near the surfa ce. The 
equilibrium positi ons of the trapping wells are located at the anti -nodes of the standing waves. 
The distance between the antinodes and the surface is approximated by d=(2N‚àí1)Œª/4, where 
N=1,2,3,‚Ä¶ is the well number starting from the surface , and Œª=1550  nm is the wavelength 
of the trapping laser. From the simulated trapping potential (Fig. 1(B)), t he separation between 
the equilibrium position of the first trapping well  and the surface is  about 430  nm. It is not 
exactly  Œª/4 because the laser is a focused beam instead of a parallel beam.  
 
After the nanodumbbell is trapped in the first well near the sapphire surface, the polarization of 
the trapping laser is changed from linear to circular by rotating a quarter waveplate. The angular 
momentum of the trapping laser applie s torque on the nanodumbbell and drive s it to rotate in a 
vacuum. The rotation frequency is determined by the balance of optical torque  (Mo) and the 
frictional  torque from the residual air given by Mf=‚àíIŒ≥Œ©rot. Here I is the moment of inertia of 
the nanodum bbell,  Œ≥ is the rotational damping rate and Œ©rot is the angular velocity of the 
rotation. While the optical torque is independent of the pressu re, the rotational damping rate  is 
proportional to the air pressure ùëÉ. Therefore, the rotation frequency is inversely proportional to 
the air pressure, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1 (D). At 5.9√ó10‚àí5 Torr , the mechanical  rotation 
frequency of the nanodumbbell reaches 1.6 GHz  (Fig. 1(D)). This correspond s to a linear 
velocit y of 1.4 km‚ãÖs‚àí1 between the tip of the nanodumbbell and the sapphire surface , separated 
by 4 30nm. While a nanosphere has been levitated near a surface before (13-15), to our best 
knowledge, this is the first report on optical levitation and GHz  rotation of a non-spherical 
nano particle  near a surface. Such a levitated GHz nanorotor near a surface can be used to explore 
fundamental physics like measuring quantum vacuum friction  (52-56).  
 
As a result of the standing wave potential, the CoM motion of a nanodumbbell levitat ed near the 
surface is significantly different from free space. Fig.  1(E) shows the PSD of the same 
nanodumbbell levitated  in the first well near the sapphire surface and in free space at 1.5 Torr  
with the trapping laser linearly polarized . The oscillation frequencies of both CoM and torsional 
motion are enhanced by the standin g wave trapping potential. In particular, the oscillation 
frequency ( fz) of the CoM motion along the z direction is enhanced by about 7 times from 
35 kHz to 250  kHz. The enhanced trapping frequencies indicate stronger spatial confinement for 
nanodumbbell s levitat ed near a sapphire surface than in free space. To demonstrate this 
phenomenon, we record the C oM position of a nanodumbbell levitated  in the first well and free 
space at 1.5 Torr and compare  their position distribution s. The measured 3D spatial dist ribution 
is shown in supplementary Fig. S3. Compared to the free space  case, the spatial distribution of 
the nanodumbbell levitated  in the first well is strongly reduced  along the z direction. The root -
mean -square (RMS) value of the z position for a nanodu mbbell levitated in the first well and free 
space are 15 nm and 109 nm, respectively. The spatial squeezing along the z direction is crucial 
for stably trapping a nanodumbbell close to a surface, especially at a high vacuum.  
 
Besides the stronger confinem ent of z motion, the oscillation frequencies of x and y motion s are 
also enhanced by the increased laser intensity gradient due to surface reflection . In the 
experiment, the x and y trapping frequencies are recorded when the nanodumbbell is trapped in 
discrete trapping wells near the sapphire surface and in free space. With that, we calculate the 
frequency enhancement ratio of x and y CoM motion s due to the surface reflection as a function 
of the particle -surface separation: Rx,y(d)= fx,y(d)/ffree  space  (shown in Fig. 1(F)). The 5 
 experimental result s agree  well with the calculat ed enhancement ratio using  the sim ulated 
trapping potential , showing we have indeed trapped the nanodumbbell near the sapphire surface.  
 
Near -field sensing with a nanodumbbell  
An important motivation for levitating a nanodumbbell  near the surface is to study fundamental 
particle -surface i nteractions by ultrasensitive torque and force  detection . For this purpose, we 
measure the torque sensitivity and 3D force sensitivity of a levitated nanodumbbell  near the 
sapphire surface. For a nanodumbbell  levitated in free space, the torque and force sensitivit ies 
are limited by the thermal noise  from the residual air in the vacuum chamber and photon shot 
noise from the trapping laser. When the nanodumbbell  is brought close to a surface, its torque 
and force sensitivit ies might  potentially  be affected by the surface.

well, respectively. (D) Three -dimensional force sensitivity of a nanodumbbell as a function of dist ance to

 Here  we measure  the torque sensitivity  (Fig. 2(A), 2(C))  and rotational damping time (Fig. 2(B)) 
as a function of pressure for  a rotating nanodumbbell and nanosphere levitated in the first well 
and in free space . The rotational damping time of the nanosphere and nanodumbbell is measured  
with the ring -up experiment , as shown in supplementary Fig. S4 and Fig. S5. The damping time 
is inversely proportional to pressure  P, indicating air damping is the domina nt dampi ng source in 
the measured pressure range. The damping time remains nearly the same when  the nanodumbbell 
is brought from free space to the first well  near a surface, indicating  no extra damping due to  the 
sapphire surface . If the nanoparticle is trapped in  a liquid, the damping rate will increase when it 
is close to a surface (59, 60 ). In contrast, the damping rate due to residual air molecules at low 
pressures is insensitive to the separation when the mean free path of molecules is much larger 
than the size of the nanoparticle and the separation (61). The torque sensitivity (38)  of a 
nanodumbbell as a function of frequency is ST1/2(Œ©rot)= I‚àö(Œ≥2+Œ©rot2) Snoise1/2(Œ©rot). Here 
ùõæ=1/ùúè is the rotational damping rate. ùêº is the moment of inertia of the nanodumbbell. 
Snoise1/2(Œ©rot) is the single -sided PSD of the angular velocity Œ©rot of thermal (Brownian ) rotation . 
The details of determining torque sensitivity are presented in Fig. S4 and Fig. S5 of the 
supplementary material. For the same nanodumbbell, the difference i n the torque sensitivity 
between the cases near the surface and in free space is within the measurement uncertainty. The 
torque sensitivities are limited by the air damping and are proportional to ‚àöùëÉ at high pressure. 
The torque sensitivity of a nanodumbbe ll levitated near the surface reaches (5.0¬±1.1)√ó
10‚àí26 NmH z‚àí1/2 at 6.1√ó10‚àí5 Torr . In addition, we perform the same measurement of 
damping time and torque sensitivity with on a nanosphere, which shows a similar trend as a 
function of pressure. Compared to a nanodumbbell,  a single nanosphere has a smaller 
momentum of inertia, resulting in a  better torque sensitivity than a nanodumbbell at the same 
pressure . However, an isot ropic nanosphere will not experience a Casimir torque that requires 
asymmetry. Therefore, the nanodumbbell is a better candidate for measuring the Casimir torque 
than a nanosphere.  
 
The 3D force sensitivity of a nanodumbbell levitat ed at 1.5 Torr is measu red as a function of the 
separation from the surface (Fig.  2(D)). The force sensitivity (7) of the nanodumbbell is limited 
by thermal noise SF,i1/2=‚àö4kBTmŒìi, where i = x,y,z represents the direction of CoM motion. 
Here, m is the mass of the nanodumbbell. T = 300 K is the temperature.  Œìi is the damping rate of 
the CoM motion, which is obtained by applying Lorentzian curve fitting to the PSDs of the C oM 
motion.  From the experiment results, the force sensitivity of the nanodumbbell is insensitive to  
the distance between the nanodumbbell and the surface , in consistent with our results of the 
torque sensitivity. The  average force sensitivity of  a nanodumbb ell along all three directions is 
about  2.5√ó10‚àí17N‚ãÖHz‚àí1/2 at 1.5 Torr.  The sensitivity will increase further when the pressure 
decreases. Thus,  a levitated nano dumbbell  near a surface can also be used for 3D near -field force 
microscopy.

nanodumbbell scanning along the x direction when it  is trapped in the first and second trapping wells near 
the nanograting surface, respectively. The frequency change in the first well measures the near -field 
intensity distribution of the nanograting. (E) Power spectrum of the rotation of a nanodumbbell ne ar the 
nanograting. Inset is the schematic diagram. The peak at 350 MHz corresponds to a rotation frequency of 
175 MHz at 1.0√ó10‚àí3 Torr. (F) Rotation frequency of the nanodumbbell as a function of air pressure 
when it is levitated in the first well near th e nanograting (red dot), in the first well near a flat sapphire 
surface (blue diamond) and in free space (black square). The solid lines are fitting curves proportional to 
1/P, where P is the pressure.  
 
In addition to trapping near a flat sapphire surface , we also levitate a nanodumbbell near a gold 
nanograting and probe subwavelength light field near the nanograting, as  shown in Fig.  3. The 
nanograting is composed of periodical gold strips on a sapphire substrate  (Fig. 3A) . The period 
of the nanograting i s ùõ¨=600  nm, and the width of each gold strip e is ùëästripe =ùõ¨/2=
300  nm. The stripes of the nanograting can not be observed  from the optical image shown in Fig.  
3(B) as their feature size is smaller than  the diffraction limit  of our optical imaging system. 
When the 1550 nm laser is focused on the nanograting (supplementary Fig. S6), the reflected 
laser from adjacent gold stripes interferes and changes the laser intensity distribution along the x 
direction. As the nanograting p eriod is much smaller than the trapping laser wavelength, such 
interference only exists in the near -field region and cannot be detected with far -field detectors. 
The CoM motion of a levitated nanodumbbell is sensitive to the laser distribution near the 
trapping region. To study the near -field diffraction of the nanograting, we scan the nanograting 
with a nanodumbbell trapped in the first well near the nanograting.

 Fig. 3(C) and Fig . 3(D) are the measured PSD s as a function of scanning position for a 
nanod umbbell levitated in the first and second well s near the nanograting , respectively . The 
oscillation frequency of x motion changes periodically when  the nanodumbbell scans in the first 
well, while the frequency remains nearly constant when the nanodumbbe ll scans in the second 
well. This shows that the near-field interference disappears at a separation of 1.2 Œºm from the 
nanograting surface.  
 
After trapping a nanodumbbell in the first well near the nanograting, we drive it to rotate in a 
vacuum  with the circularly polarized trapping laser . At 1.0√ó10‚àí3 Torr, the rotational frequency 
of the nanodumbbell levitat ed near nanograting reaches  175  MHz . Fig . 3(F) shows the rotation 
frequency as a function of pressure for the same nanodumbbell trapped in the first well near a 
flat sapphire  surface, in the first well near nanograting , and in free space. For all three cases, the 
rotation frequency follows the 1/ P dependence, as air damping is the dominant damping source. 
The difference between the rotation frequencies for different configurations at the same pressure 
is caused by different amounts of reflection from the surface, which changes the optical torque. 
The nanodumbbell levitated near the nanograting has the highest rotation frequency among these 
three situations at a given pressure due to  the high reflectivity of the gold nanograting . In 
addition, we have levitated a nanodumbbell near a gold micro -disk (su pplementary Fig. S7), 
which shows an even larger enhancement in trapping frequencies.  
 
Simulation of the Casimir torque on a nanodumbbell near a nanograting  
According to quantum electrodynamics, a vacuum is not empty but full of virtual photons 
(quantum va cuum fluctuations). The quantum vacuum fluctuations can lead to an attractive force 
between neutral plates in vacuum, known as the Casimir force (62). If the plates are optically 
anisotropic, vacuum fluctuations can also induce a torque between them (63, 64 ). While the 
Casimir force has been measured extensively (65-70), the Casimir torque has only been 
measured with liquid cry stals at small separations (51). A nanodumbbell levitated near a 
nanograting will provide an opportunity to study the Casimir torque at different separations 
systematically (50, 71 ), especially at separations when the retardation effect is important. A  
nanograting not only causes near -field interference of re al photons but also breaks the rotational 
symmetry of virtual photons  near it (57, 68, 71 ). Thus, the Casimir energy between a levitated 
nanodumbbell and the nanograting is angular dependent, producing a Casimir torque along the 
rotation axis. Due to the complex geometry, the Casimir torque between a levitated 
nanodumbbell and a nanostructur e has not been calculated before.  
 
Here we numerically  calculate the Casimir effect between a nanodumbbell and a gold 
nanograting (Fig.  4(A)). In parti cular, we use the SCUFF -CAS3D codes (see Supplementary 
Materials for more information) (72, 73), which are based on the fluctuation -surface current 
method, to calculate the Casimir effect on a nanodumbbell levitated  370 nm from the 
nanograting. Compared to a birefringent crystal, the properties of a nanograting can be tuned at 
will by nanofabrication. The nanograting can affect both spin and spatial distribution of vacuum 
fluctuations, inducing novel effects that do not exist for natural birefringent crystals (57, 68 ). Our 
calculated Casimir torque on the nanodumbbell shows a strong dependence on the width of the 
nanograting , as shown in Fig. 4(B) . At the separation of 370 nm, the maximum Casimir torque 
happens when  the grating width is about 3 00 nm.

Figure 4(C) shows the calculated angular dependen ce of the  Casimir torque on the nanodumbbell  
near a nanograting . As a result of the rotational symmetry, the Casimir torque shows a period of 
180¬∞ over the angle Œ∏ between the long axis of the nanodumbbell and the nanograting. The 
Casimir torque on the nanodumbbell reach es a maximum value of 1.4√ó10‚àí24 N‚ãÖm  at |Œ∏|=
135¬∞ ,315¬∞ . Such a Casimir torque is one order  larger than  our measured torque sensitivity of a 
nanodumbbell  (Fig. 2(A)) . Casimir torque as a function of separation is also calculated  in Fig. 
4D. The Casimir force on the nanodumbbell at 370 nm separation is about 3.0√ó10‚àí16 N 
(supple mentary  Fig. S8 ), which is also  well above the force sensitivity of the nanodumbbell. 
Therefore, this system is sensitive enough to detect the Casimir torque and Casimir force on the 
nanodumbbell. A free -fall experiment could be used to detect such a static effect (50, 74 ).  
 
Discussion   
In summary, we have demonstrated near-field GHz mechanic al rotation with a nanodumbbell 
levitat ed by optical tweezers at about 4 30 nm from a sapphire surface. The standing wave formed 
by the reflection of the optical tweezers from the surface provide s a stable trapping potential  near 
the surface , where a nanodumbbell is stably trapped and driven to rotate in a high vacuum 
10 
 without feedback cooling. The nanodumbbell maintains its superior to rque and force sensitivities 
at sub -micrometer separation from a surface.  The achieved  torque sensitivity of a nanodumbbell 
levitated near the surface is  5.0√ó10‚àí26 Nm/Hz1/2 at 6.1√ó10‚àí5 Torr, and the  achieved force 
sensitivity is about 2.5 √ó10‚àí17N‚ãÖHz‚àí1/2 at 1.5 Torr.  We also trap a  nanodumbbell ne ar a gold 
nanograting and use it to detect the near -field laser intensity distribution beyond the diffraction 
limit. Our simulation shows this system is sensitive enough to  detect the Casimir torque on a 
nanodumbbell near a nanograting .  
 
Currently, the highest rotation frequency of our nanodumbbell near a surface is limited by the 
increased C oM vibration amplitude at low pressure. In the future, external feedback cooling can 
be used to stabilize the C oM moti on to achieve a higher rotational frequency limited by the 
ultimate tensile strength of the material  (39). To detect the Casimir torque with a levitated 
nanodumbbell, we can  use the fre e-fall method  (50, 74 ). The prerequisite of such measurement  is 
to cool the C oM motion as well as the torsional motion of the nanodumbbell simultaneously. 
This can be done with feedback cooling (40, 41 ) or coherent scattering (42). The nanodumbbell 
can detect both Casimir torque and force in the same free fall experiment near the nanograting. A 
nanoparticle  rotating at high speed near a surface will also be ideal for detecting the quantum 
vacuum friction (52-56) at a high vacuum when the effect of air damping is smaller than the
