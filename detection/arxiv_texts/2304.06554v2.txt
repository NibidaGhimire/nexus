ABSTRACT
In all of medical profession a broad ﬁeld of research is dedicated to seek less invasive and low-risk forms of therapy with
the ultimate goal of non-invasive therapy, particularly in neoplasmic diseases. Theranostic platforms, combining diagnostic
and therapeutic approaches within one system, have thus garnered interest to augment invasive surgical, chemical, and
ionizing interventions. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) offers, with its versatile tracer material (superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles, SPION), a quite recent alternative to established radiation based diagnostic modalities. In addition, MPI lends a
bimodal theranostic frame allowing to combine tomographic imaging with therapy techniques using the very same SPION. In
this work, we show for the ﬁrst time the interleaved combination of MPI-based imaging, therapy (highly localized magnetic
ﬂuid hyperthermia) and therapy safety control (MPI-based thermometry) within one theranostic platform in all three spatial
dimensions.
Introduction
Diagnosis and therapy are the two sides of the same medal applied by the medical professions. Usually, they are executed
asynchronously, but with an improvement of technology it became feasible to put the coin back into one palm and the neologism
"theranostics" was created1–3. Even though it originally aimed to explain dual use of substances e.g. in nuclear medicine,
point of care diagnostic and drug delivery3, 4,theranostics does propose instrumentation capable of both imaging and treatment
in one device5which we report on in the following enabled by a quite recent imaging modality: Magnetic Particle Imaging
integrated with Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia.
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging technique allowing for non-invasive quantiﬁcation of versatile
single domain iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION)6, 7. The foundational concept of MPI was introduced in 2005 entailing
an alternating magnetic ﬁeld (drive ﬁeld), which allows to change the magnetization of SPION8. Hereby, the intrinsic
superparamagnetic properties of these SPIONs are exploited, as their non-linear magnetization response results in a distorted
signal which can be detected by a receive system. The induced SPION signal, analyzed in the frequency domain, contains
a plurality of harmonics of the drive frequency9. This induced signal scales linearly with the SPION concentration10and
thus makes MPI a quantitative method. By superimposing a static magnetic gradient ﬁeld (selection ﬁeld) vanishing at the
center (ﬁeld free region, FFR), the SPION signal can be encoded in space to permit for tomographic imaging8. This isarXiv:2304.06554v2  [physics.med-ph]  17 Apr 2023a consequence of the SPIONs’ magnetization curve as they magnetically saturate outside the FFR not contributing to the
received signal8. In contrast, magnetic SPIONs inside the FFR contribute distinctively to the received signal and thus permit
tomographic image formation8. During image acquisition, the FFR is moved in space by two additional superimposed magnetic
ﬁelds in a predeﬁned trajectory spanning up an accessible ﬁeld-of-view (FOV)9, 11. Since only the magnetic SPIONs’ speciﬁc
magnetization properties contribute to the image signals, MPI displays high sensitivity towards these magnetic SPIONs and
a background free contrast12.In vivo SPIONs remain superparamagnetic until hydrolyzed, enzymatically degraded13or
excreted along the mononuclear phagocytic system14, 15offering the possibility for long term monitoring depending on their
metabolic properties16. Also, changes in the SPION’s environment such as its temperature, viscosity, and pH17–19inﬂuence
their magnetization. This opens the door for a wide range of applications20including MPI-based thermometry21, 22. While
contributing to image generation in the FFR, magnetic SPIONs may become subject to further physical manipulations. For
example, high frequency alternating magnetic ﬁelds (AMF) may lead to energy dissipation (heating) caused by magnetization
losses governed by internal Néel ﬂuctuations of (single domain) SPION magnetic moments, external Brownian ﬂuctuations and
potentially magnetisation hysteresis23. This heating procedure by alternating magnetic ﬁelds (AMF) is called magnetic ﬂuid
hyperthermia (MFH)24. By exploiting the same spatial encoding mechanism as in MPI, the volume in which magnetic SPIONs
contribute to MFH can be conﬁned in 3D by the same magnetic gradient ﬁeld to the vicinity of the FFR25. Heating efﬁciency
is determined by SPION’s speciﬁc-absorption rate (SAR) and is dependent on shape anisotropy26, coating material27and
thickness28, particle size29, and thermal conductivity of the surface coating and solvent viscosity30. From an instrumentation
point of view, the SAR is governed by the amplitude and frequency of the AMF excitation while the spatial speciﬁcity is
dominated by the magnetic ﬁeld gradient slope. Wedding magnetic particle imaging and magnetic ﬂuid hyperthermia could
thus offer unprecedented beneﬁts for the ﬁeld of theranostics and was indeed already attempted in back to back instruments to
selectively target liver tumors in vivo without substantially heating surrounding tissue31. In the study at hand we go beyond this
success and demonstrate tomographic MPI interleaved with locally restricted MFH (MPI-MFH) while controlling for achieved
temperatures with MPI-based thermometry within the same platform and session.
Results
General description of our MPI-based theranostic system
In this study, an in situ theranostic platform was established allowing for interleaving diagnostics with magnetically focused
MFH-therapy and image-based temperature monitoring without the need for target re-location. This theranostic platform
consists of a commercial preclinical MPI system (MPI 25/20FF, Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen) as a tomographic
imaging device equipped with a custom-made hyperthermia insert32serving as a therapeutic tool. A powerful user-interface
accesses the hardware communication and signal generation for the entire theranostic platform. An MPI-based thermometry21
feed-back-loop is included to comply with predeﬁned temperature limits as well as to control hyperthermia duration - accounting
for safety and efﬁcacy. The user-interface allows to deﬁne all imaging and heating parameters, enabling selection of a therapy
volume based on existing images. Before assessing the whole integrated MPI-MFH platform, the general capacity of MFH
within the FOV was tested. SPION suspensions and water samples of the same volume were subjected to MFH and the
temperature proﬁle was monitored with a thermal camera (see ﬁgure 1C). Depending on the position within the sample holder,
and therefore the relative position within the MPI-MFH platform, temperature increases of 15.6K up to 20.9K were observed
for aqueous SPION samples. In the control samples without SPION only negligible heating (up to 0.1K) was observed. We
therefore conclude, that the source of the detected SPION suspension heating was caused by the AMF induced MFH and
did not result from system or phantom related heating effects. Subsequently, the extent of the ﬁeld of therapy (FOT), i.e. the
general working space allowing MFH and MPI , was determined by subjecting aqueous SPION samples distributed within
the MPI-MFH platform to a non-speciﬁc global AMF (focus ﬁelds OFF). In the relative center of the MPI-MFH platform
temperature increases of up to DT= 22.6K were observed with a steady decline along the system’s x-plane. Eventually, AMF
became ineffective at a distance of 8 mm from the system’s center in both directions of the x-plane. We conclude that the
implemented MPI-MFH platform offers a usable FOT of approximately 16x16x16 mm3(x,y,z) (see ﬁgure 2 ) while using
global heating with this hyperthermia insert.
MPI-MFH theranostic platform offers a localized ﬁeld of therapy
In order to minimize off-target side-effects a focused application of hyperthermia is highly desired in most imaginable
applications. Estimating the extend of the MFH target therefore provides crucial information on the minimal achievable
therapeutic volume within our set up. With focus ﬁelds ON the highest temperature of +4.6 K was measured at the coordinate
center and predictably decreased with increasing distance along each axis with the FFR ﬁxed (see ﬁgure 3). Corresponding to
the greater drive ﬁeld gradient strength in z-direction (42 mT in z- vs. 17 mT in each x- and y- direction), a steeper temperature
distribution is observed in z- as compared to y-direction (see ﬁgure 3right). In x- and y- direction, the temperature increase
becomes negligible beyond a distance of 5 mm to the FFR ( DT = 0 K & 0.7 K (+x & -x), and DT = 0.5 & 0.6 K (+y & -y

characterization of global heating (focus ﬁelds OFF) and spatial distribution in a 3D phantom of SPION samples within the
FOT distributed over a grid of 16x16mm (in y-and z- direction) surrounding the center of the MPI-MFH platform (x =0)
). In z-direction, no signiﬁcant temperature increase was observed beyond 3 mm to the FFR ( DT = 0.5 K and 0.6 K for +z
and -z respectively). We thus assess the heating function of our system’s ﬁxed FFR to affect a volume of 5x5x3 mm3(x, y, z)
corresponding to the spatial distribution of the magnetic gradients within the hyperthermia insert.
MFH volume depends on the extent of focus and properties of the SPION solvent
The actual temperature distribution inside a physical target is not only deﬁned by the shape of above estimated affected
volume, but by the heat conduction properties of said target as well. The temperature distribution will become due to intrinsic
heat conduction more fuzzy than expected from above discrete points in air (see ﬁgure 3) . To illustrate this effect, the
surface temperatures of a thin slice of gelled agarose ( 0.6% w/w) containing 1mg(Fe)/ml SPION were recorded upon focused
(focus ﬁeld ON) and global (focus ﬁeld OFF) MFH (see ﬁgure 4). During focused MFH with the FFR at the center of the
agarose-SPION sample, substantial temperature increase in y-direction can be detected in the thermal picture beyond a distance
3/18Figure 2. Characterization of ﬁeld of therapy The heating efﬁciency of SPION at distinct spatial locations within the
MPI-MFH platform was assessed. For that, 9 thin walled glass tubes, each ﬁlled with 50 µL SPION (synomag-S-90) and
topped with parafﬁn were placed horizontally inside a 3D-printed sample holder. The bottom of the samples was facing
towards a thermal camera in approximately 1 :5 m distance. The 9 samples were distributed equidistantly across the cross
section at the relative center of the hyperthermia insert. Subsequently, AMF was applied (focus ﬁeld gradients OFF, i.e. global
MFH subjected to the entire FOT). By moving the sample holder in deﬁned increments of 8 mm along the x plane (both in -x
and x direction), the extent of heating in x, y, z direction was determined.
of25 mm from the center of MFH application. In z-direction, the heated area extents to approximately 10mm in both directions
from center. Assuming a similar extent of heating in x- and y-direction, the affected region exceeds 50 mm x50 mm x20 mm
in hydrogel (see ﬁgure 4C). The heating function in a continuous, heat conducting sample is thus 10 times more blurred than
expected from thermally independent sampling. Global heating of the entire sample, resulted in higher maximal temperatures
in the center of the sample as compared to local heating (see ﬁgure 4B). During global heating, the entire SPION samples
are heated while during local heating the heated spot (i.e. the FFR) is constantly dissipating heat to the cooler, unheated
surroundings by conduction.
Iron core size as predictor for heating efﬁciency in commercially available SPION
In a theranostic application, both the image quality and therapeutic value (i.e. in our case heating efﬁciency) have to be
considered. Therefore, we investigated the heating performance of 10 different SPION known for their good imaging quality.
Only three of the SPION used in this study showed clear temperature increase upon MFH application. As expected, the
maximal temperature showed a strong dependence on the iron concentration with an overall maximal temperature increase
for each SPION being achieved at their respective commercial stock concentration (see ﬁgure 5A). The best heating abilities
were observed for SPIONs at stock concentration (10mg(Fe)/ml): Temperatures of 37.2K, 27.2K, and 20.6K were measured
for synomag-S-90, synomag-D-70 and synomag-D-50 respectively. The respective SPION’s rate of heating corroborates the
dependency on the iron concentration (see ﬁgure 5B). The SPION’s calculated SAR in aqueous suspension showed an initial
increase with increasing iron concentration for synomag-D-70, synomag-S-90 and BNF, perimag plain, and perimag COOH.
This was followed by plateaued or even slightly decreasing SAR values at higher iron concentrations. The remaining SPION
displayed quite constant SAR values despite increasing concentration (see ﬁgure 5C). When comparing the maximal temperature
achieved during MFH in relation to the SPION iron core size, a dependence of heating efﬁciency on core size becomes evident.
4/18Figure 3. MFH-FFR The system’s FFR, presumably a point, was coordinate ﬁxed to the relative center of the MPI-MFH
platform. An 8 µL SPION sample was subsequently moved along all three axes in 1 mm increments and subjected to AMF
revealing the MFH’s spread function relative to the FFR.
The highest temperature was achieved with the largest core size at the highest iron concentration (synomag-S-90 at 10mg(Fe)/ml,
see ﬁgure 5D). Comparing the maximal temperature achieved during MFH in relation to the SPION hydrodynamic diameter a
similar dependency is observed, however less pronounced. The highest temperature was achieved with the second largest core
size at the highest iron concentration (synomag-S-90 at 10mg(Fe)/ml, see ﬁgure 5E) while the SPION sample with largest
hydrodynamic diameter (perimag plain, perimag COOH = 130nm) achieved only negligible temperature increase at highest
concentration. The iron weighted magnetic moment of the different SPION showed a similar course compared to the maximally
achieved temperature increase, slope and SARs of the samples (see ﬁgure 5F). The lowest magnetic moments, and steepest
decay with increasing harmonics was observed for BNF SPION. Highest temperature values were observed for synomag
SPION.
MPI-MFH based theranostic platform offers spatial and temporal control of hyperthermia
In order to avoid systemic and/or off-target side-effects, spatial control and local conﬁnement of heat application during
hyperthermia treatment is highly desired. By adjusting the focus ﬁeld gradients in x-, y- and z- direction samples at different,
disjunct positions can be targeted within one sequence. To investigate that capability, several SPION samples were placed at
different positions in the yz- plane (x = 0) and by adjusting the corresponding gradients, arbitrary spatial selection of MFH
was demonstrated (see ﬁgure 6). Thermal camera images show snapshots of temperature maps at different time points while
independent targets were aimed at. The adjacent plot indicates the extent of heating relative to the start temperature. The results
display a sequential MFH-walk through each sample position, ending with a global application of AMF. The same approach
has been applied to a homogeneous agarose-SPION mixture placed in a petri dish such that the MFH target described a circular
trajectory in the SPION-laced hydrogel. Next to the corresponding thermal camera images at selected time points, the local
temperature maxima within 10 s intervals are plotted. The trajectory covering the extent of the agarose area is plotted further
illustrating the effectivity of the localized sequence for heating.
MPI-MFH theranostic platform allows for tomographic imaging, localized hyperthermia and multicolor ther-
mometry
To testify the successful integration of a true theranostic device, consisting of an imaging and an interventional module, a
sequence of alternating MPI and MFH episodes was applied to several SPION samples similar to the experimental set up
used above. This time, an additional feature was added to the platform by utilizing the multi-color method for MPI based
thermometry. Here the temperature distribution is retraced during MFH using speciﬁc image reconstruction of the MPI images
acquired during the MPI-MFH experiment. The multi-color reconstructed temperature values were subsequently validated
by the temperature proﬁle of thermal camera recordings. The resulting temperature proﬁle, overlayed with the MPI-based

temperature values, are presented in ﬁgure 7B.
The left hand SPION-sample (y = -8 mm) was subjected to MFH and consequently shows a steep temperature increase upon
application onset while the temperature of the 2 adjacent samples remained relatively constant as compared to baseline. Since
the absolute MPI-reconstructed temperature values are based on normalization with the temperature values of the thermal
camera measurements, absolute maximal temperature values are shared between these two modes of temperature measurement.
However, comparison of the maximal relative temperature increase ( DT) as well as qualitative comparison of the progression
of heating between thermal camera and MPI based temperature may be effective for an interpretation of the results. The
MFH-heated sample showed a maximal temperature increase measured by thermal camera of 7.8 K while a maximal increase
of 7.9 K was obtained with the multicolor MPI-method. The center sample’s temperature (y = 0 mm) increased 1.8 and 1.7 K
for thermal camera and MPI based temperature values respectively. The largest difference, could be observed for the sample
with the furthest distance to the heating target (y= 8 mm) where 1.7 K (thermal camera) and 0.8 K (MPI reconstructed) increase
in temperature was measured. The rapid initial heating of the MFH targeted sample can be similarly well depicted with thermal
camera as with the MPI multicolor method. Subsequently, there is a slight overshoot of the MPI reconstructed temperature
values as compared to thermal camera measurements followed by a brief period when both temperature values plateau at similar
values.

y = -8, 0, 8 mm form center) were subjected to alternating MPI-MFH sequences. By adjusting the MFH-FFR, the SPION
sample positioned at y= -8 mm, was targeted by MFH while MPI images were acquired of all samples (A). A sketch of the
MPI-MFH sequence is depicted in the lower left. The MPI images are reconstructed applying the multi-color method for
MPI-based thermometry (lower right). Multi-color reconstructed temperature values (red, green and blue dots) are overlayed

MPI-MFH platform adjusts to new hyperthermia target during application
The previous two sections showed the feasibility of MFH-target localization and alternating MPI-MFH sequences with MPI
based thermometry in one theranostic platform. In the following, we present the results of the combination of both, i.e. a
MPI-MFH platform with arbitrarily alterable theranostic targets (see ﬁgure 8). The thermal camera measurements as well
as the plot showing the heating process over the duration of the experiment (see ﬁgure 8B, red, blue & green lines), show
the successive heating of three small SPION samples beginning with the left hand sample. The MPI images acquired during
MPI-MFH sequences (see ﬁgure 8A upper right) served as basis for subsequent MPI-based multi-color thermometry. The
resulting calculated temperature values show adequate overall agreement when aligned with the thermal camera recordings (see
ﬁgure8B; red, green & blue dots).

MPI-MFH procedure is limited in circulatory system
This study aims to testify the general characteristics of an MPI and MFH-based theranostic platform. As most reports on
treatment with MFH utilized accumulated or injected SPION31, 33, stationary phantoms with well deﬁned SPION samples
seemed to be adequate test objects. However, systemic SPION applications by i.v. injection are not well represented by static
phantoms and the application gap to living breathing beings has still to be tackled. In order to narrow down that gap a little,
we included one very important parameter into our phantoms: Forced transport of SPION solutions through the MFH-target
volume similar to blood ﬂow reduced interaction and heating times. A circulatory tubing system in plain sight of the thermal
camera was set up within the bore of our MPI-MFH platform. Without ﬂow (v0= 0 ml =min) a maximal temperature increase of
1:6 Kwas achieved on the surface of the thin tubing. Flow velocities of v= 0 cms 1up to v= 10:3 cms 1were applied achieving
temperature increases of 1.6 and 0.5K respectively. An exemplary MPI image of the circulation tube (v = 0:65 cms 1) and the
corresponding thermal camera image during heating is depicted in ﬁgure 9 upper right. MPI-based multi color reconstruction
of the temperature proﬁle during MPI-MFH application was attempted for each of the indicated ﬂow velocities. However, only
reconstruction of the slowest velocities (0, 0.17, 0.25, 0.33, 0.41 cm/s ) showed good overall alignment with the temperature
readings from the thermal camera (shown in the exemplary temperature progression and multi-color reconstructed temperature
values in ﬁgure 9 lower left). At higher velocities, such alignment was found to be inconsistent. It has to be stated, that the
small temperature increase seen on the tubing walls by thermal camera were achieved by very short AMF in 10 mL tube volume
as compared to the 140 µL volume of the glass vials with SPION optimized for imaging, but not for highest possible heating
properties.
Discussion
Theranostic platforms have gathered quite some interest, on the one hand for minimizing invasiveness and off target effects
during and post-therapy and on the other hand for augmenting the real-time reactivity during intervention. Exploiting MPI
imaging properties as a mean of generating temperature increase for potential therapeutic interventions has been reported in
previous works11, 35. Indeed, MPI-MFH based platforms have been described for targeted MFH delivery31, 36, 37. However,
interleaving MPI and MFH sequences, offers the potential for a therapeutic feed-back loop by periodically imaging the targeted
SPION samples within the FOT which, by means of MPI based thermometry, provides potentially real-time monitoring and
therapy-parameter adjustments. Purpose of this study was to demonstrate the general feasibility of an MPI based theranostic
platform which entails tomographic imaging, thermometry and directional, highly localized "therapy" within the same system
in the context of phantom experiments. We were able to demonstrate high spatial control on the scale of millimeters for
both imaging and MFH application and adequate resolution of temperature reconstruction in situ . MPI based multi-color
reconstruction of temperature values depends on the linear relationship of imaging signal and SPION temperature. The highest

MPI bore to mimic (blood) circulation and investigate the effect of circulation velocity on heating efﬁciency. A thermal camera
was placed in front of the MPI bore such that the heating target (inside the AMF of the hyperthermia insert) as well as portions
of the circulation tube outside the AMF were visible. The temperature progression outside the AMF was deﬁned as offset
temperature and subtracted from the heating target inside the MPI bore for each timepoint during heating. The mean
temperature increase of a 24s heating period was plotted for different ﬂow velocities. The temperature increase at a circulation

regression model was ﬁtted to the data points.
discrepancy between multi-color reconstructed and thermal camera monitored temperature values were observed for high
velocities in a circulation phantom. We conclude therefore, that the limit of multi-color temperature reconstruction is reached
here and based on the comparatively slight temperature increase achieved during MFH of high velocity circulation. Longer
imaging sessions with more averages or improved SPION could be used to enhance the multi-color reconstruction result. It
should be noted here, that the thermal camera measures the temperature of the tubing’s surface, while MPI based temperature
reconstruction is based on the SPION’s temperature. We observed good MFH properties for SPION also exhibiting high
measured magnetic moments. This may indicate that SPION properties improving imaging quality, such as their shape and size,
impact MFH performance and has to be considered while pursuing theranostic SPION.
Methods
MPI-MFH theranostic platform
The commercial MPI system used in this study generates a magnetic ﬁeld gradient of up to 2.5 T/m in z-direction and 1.25
T/m in x- and y- direction (Selection Field) used in our case for both spatial encoding during imaging and deﬁnition of the
heating region in the MFH-based intervention. By means of 3 orthogonal homogeneous magnetic offset ﬁelds (Focus Fields)
with amplitudes of up to 17 mT, 17 mT and 42 mT for x-, y-, and z-direction respectively (see ﬁgure 1 A for a representative
overview), both the imaging FOV and the ﬁeld of therapy (FOT) can be shifted in space. During MPI image generation, the
SPION are excited using 3 time-variant orthogonal homogeneous magnetic ﬁelds (Drive Fields) with amplitudes of up to 14
mT in each direction and resonance frequencies of 25 kHz. For heat generation during MFH application, the SPION are excited
using a custom-made single-axis time-variant homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld (Hyperthermia Field) applied by a hyperthermia
insert32which was designed as a gradiometric coil to decouple it from the transmit-receive Drive Field coil set (for imaging).
The hyperthermia insert is placed concentrically inside the MPI’s bore. A radio frequency power ampliﬁer (T& C Power
Conversion, Inc. Model AG 1012 Ampliﬁer Generator) was used to generate and amplify the signal of the system. When
applying the maximum working power of 600 W, the hyperthermia insert is capable of generating an average ﬁeld strength
10/18of11:2 mT , with a standard deviation of 410 4mT over a volume of 22.5 mm 18 mm 12 mm (for x,y,z) around the
center of the heating coil (see ﬁgure 1B for a representative overview). The MFH ﬁeld strength for all measurements presented
in this work was set to 10 mT along the x-axis. In order to limit the power transferred to the MPI scanner, the hyperthermia
insert has compensation winding which create a magnetic ﬁeld in the opposite direction of the primary heating ﬁeld32. The
hyperthermia insert itself is cooled with oil to avoid hardware overheating and additionally an air ﬂow system was applied at
the MPI bore entry. This was of systemic importance for achieving maximal heating durations and steady temperatures of
the targeted SPION, while minimizing the risk of overheating. As the MFH-excitation frequency of 715 kHz lays within the
imaging detection bandwidth of the MPI its low noise receive ampliﬁers were safe guarded with an additional low-pass ﬁlter
and/or ampliﬁer blanking device. While the low-pass ﬁlter suppresses not only the MFH feed-through-signal but also the high
frequency components for imaging purposes, the latter implementation has no negative impact to the imaging bandwidth but
needs active components which interacts with the theranostic scan program. With the hyperthermia insert installed, the free
accessible bore diameter of the integrated theranostic platform measures 65 mm, suitable for preclinical in vivo studies. Since
MPI imaging and MFH therapy are both based on magnetic SPION excitation, several measures needed to be implemented to
prevent harmful subsystem interactions.
Temperature measurements
During experiments, if not speciﬁcally stated otherwise, temperature proﬁles were recorded using a thermal camera (FLIR
Systems, A8303sc with custom macro lens, 20 mK temperature resolution and 30 Hz frame rate and 308 mm pixel size) that
was placed approximately 1:5 min front of the MPI scanner system with unobstructed line of view inside the bore. Temperature
progressions were analyzed by manually deﬁning ROIs covering the respective sample and extracting the maximal temperature
per time point.
MFH applications in SPION phantom
If not stated otherwise, all temperature measurements during MFH application were done in a 3D printed circular sample holder
(59 mm , L = 48 mm ) designed to ﬁt the hyperthermia insert and equipped with several notches to allow for sufﬁcient air ﬂow
(see ﬁgure 1). The sample holder can accommodate 9 samples at once, spaced 2 mm apart in y- and z- direction. Thin walled
glass tubes (6 50 mm , Disposable culture tubes, Borosilicate Glass, Kimble) served as punctiform MFH targets. The glass
tubes were sealed off with parafﬁn to avoid drying out. The glass tubes were placed horizontally inside the sample holder,
the bottom facing the thermal camera such that a circular target is presented, resulting in a 3x3 grid spanned in y-z- direction
between -8 and 8 mm relative to the hyperthermia insert’s center for any given location on the x plane.
As proof of concept, the sample tubes ﬁlled with 140 µl of SPION suspension (synomag-S-90, 10mg(Fe)/ml) or 140 µl of water,
were heated in 2 separate MFH sessions using the maximal power of 600W with 2 heating cycles of 22 s.
Characterization of ﬁeld of therapy
Upon equipping a sample holder (see ﬁgure 1C) with SPION samples positioned at all locations in y- and z- direction, the
entire sample holder was moved through the hyperthermia insert in x- direction in seven 8 mm increments going from -24 mm
to +24 mm relative to the hyperthermia insert center. Locations in x-direction are hereby corresponding to the center of the
SPIONs sample. At each incremental position, MFH was applied to the entire inner volume of the hyperthermia insert (global
MFH) yielding a total of 63 individual positions and covering an area of 48mm 16mm 16mm (x, y, z). A sketch of the
experimental set up is depicted in ﬁgure2. MFH was applied using the maximal power of the hyperthermia insert (600 W) with
2 heating cycles of 25s each.
3D Characterization of localized FFP-MFH
To precisely determine the system’s heat production function, i.e. the extent of SPION heating along the orthogonal planes of
the MPI-MFH experimental set up, the location of the FFR was ﬁxed at the center of the hyperthermia insert. A punctiform
calibration sample was attached to a holder rod and moved to each position inside the MPI-MFH platform’s FOT in 1 mm
increments (see ﬁgure 3left), very much alike the process of system matrix acquisition. The calibration sample consisted of a
temperature-stable PVC tube ﬁlled with 27 µL SPION suspension (synomag-D-70, plain, Micromod Germany, 10 mg(Fe)/ml).
Heating was achieved by sending power through the heating coil (P = 300 W, one cycle of 30 s) at each spatial location. Focused
MFH was achieved by focus ﬁeld gradients in x,y,z direction of 1.25 T/m , 1.25 T/m , 2.5 T/m respectively. Temperature of the
SPION sample was monitored by a commercial ﬁber optic temperature sensor (TS2, Weidmann-Optocon, Germany) introduced
through the lid of the PVC tube, with ample cooling time between different spatial positions.
Characterization of localized and global MFH in a continuous hydrogel sample
A SPION (synomag-D-70) suspension was added to molten agarose (0.6% by weight; simulating brain tissue visco-elasticity38)
leading to a concentration of 1 mg(Fe)/ml in a culture dish (glass bottom dish 50mm x 7mm, Wilco Wells). Upon solidifying to
11/18an approximately 5 mm thick layer, the dish was placed upright in the center of the hyperthermia insert with the lid off the dish,
such that the circular surface of uncovered agar faced the thermal camera for high speed thermal monitoring. Thereby, heating
of the thin agar-layer could be observed in y and z-direction on the surface of the hydrogel. The SPION-agarose suspension
target was heated (P = 600W) either locally (focus ﬁeld gradients of 1 T/m , 1 T/m , 2 T/m (x,y,z) with the FFR located at the
center of the MPI-MFH system or globally (focus ﬁeld off i.e. no FFR). An overview of the experimental set up is shown in
ﬁgure 4A. For comparison of the maximally achieved temperature during both measurements, a circular ROI was manually
deﬁned at the center of the thermal camera monitored culture dish, and the maximal temperature was extracted over time. The
extent of heating during localized MFH was determined by placing 2 orthogonal lines of the same size through the center of the
monitored agarose suspension and extracting the temperature values along those lines which correspond to y- and z- direction
inside the MPI-MFH platform. ﬁgure 4B).
Targeting the ﬁeld of therapy
The selection ﬁeld gradient deﬁnes the spatial resolution during MPI9by determining the FFR. Simultaneously, the magnetiza-
tion response of the deployed SPION inﬂuences to the spatial resolution: A steep magnetization slope leads to higher spatial
selectivity.
A similar mechanism is expected to apply to the MFH targets. Therefore, component parameters of the MPI system deﬁne the
extent of the FOT during AMF applications and the point spread function of the FFR deﬁnes the focus of the MFH treatment
since only SPION within the FFR are susceptible to time varying changes. Finally, any shift to the FFR using focus ﬁelds
allows to similarly shift the FOT to any spatial target within the MFH FOT.
The above described sample holder ( see ﬁgure 1C) was used to demonstrate directional control of heat application. The
phantom was equipped with 9 SPION samples (synomag-S-90, 5mg(Fe)/ml, Micromod Germany) and placed at the center of
the hyperthermia insert. Subsequently, each of the sample locations (in y-and z-direction) was targeted successively using the
same MFH parameters for each location: P = 600 W , focus ﬁeld gradient = 1 T=m,1 T=m,2 T=m(x,y,z), 1 heating cycle of
duration = 10 s.
Comparison of different SPIONs
To keep things simple SPION entailing both good imaging and MFH quality would be best suited for optimal theranostic
performance. We compared different commercially available SPION, which have been predominantly used for imaging
purposes, concerning their ability to generate heat using the set up introduced here. A table of the SPION’s characteristics
can be found in (ﬁgure 10). The described SPION sample holder (see ﬁg 1C ) was used. The heating performance of the
different SPION samples was determined in successive separate MFH sessions at the same speciﬁcally chosen spatial locations
to account for any potential phantom or gradient related inhomogeneity. Different SPION sample concentrations were used (0.6,
1.2, 2.4 mg(Fe)/ml for all, 5 and 10 mg(Fe)/ml when applicable). The individual speciﬁc commercial stock concentration served
as upper concentration limit for the respective SPION (see table 10). During MFH the maximal power of the hyperthermia insert
(P=600 W ) was applied for 2 consecutive heating cycles with 20s duration each. The thermal camera monitored temperature
proﬁles were analyzed by extracting the maximal temperature per time point. The speciﬁc absorption rate (SAR) of each
sample was then calculated from the temperature proﬁles using the following formula:
SAR=CH20mH20
mFeDT
Dt(1)
Here CH20is the heat capacity of water ( 4:168 J =gK),mH20is the mass of water of the sample, mFeis the mass of iron in the
sample, andDT
Dtis the slope of temperature increase during the ﬁrst time points of the MFH application.
MPS measurements (pure devices, drive ﬁeld = 25mT, excitation frequency = 25kHz) were performed using 50 µL of each
SPION sample (see 10) at their respective stock concentration. For comparison, the results were normalized for the different
iron concentrations.
Interleaved MPI-MFH and MPI thermometry
The above described sample holder (see ﬁg 1C ) equipped with three SPION samples was placed inside the MPI-MFH system
such that the center of each of the samples located at x, z=0 was aligned in y-direction at positions y = +8 mm, 0 mm & -8 mm
(see ﬁgure 7A). The three samples were periodically imaged (MPI). The imaging sequence was hereby alternating with the
MFH-sequence, targeting the SPION sample at y = -8 mm (see 7). MPI-MFH sessions consisted of blocks lasting 6.1s per
repetition (1.1 s (50 averages) imaging and 5s heating respectively), with a total number of 40 repetitions (acquisition time
248s). Other parameters were: acquisition bandwidth of 1.25MHz, drive ﬁeld strength of 14, 14, 14 mT (x,y,z), selection ﬁeld
gradient strength of 1, 1, 2T/m (x,y,z), and drive ﬁeld FOV of 20, 28, 14 mm (x,y,z). Images were acquired with matrix size =
12/18Figure 10. Table of used SPIONs
20, 20, 20 (x,y,z). The FOV was set, analog to the FOT, to 40, 40, 20mm (x, y, z).
The acquired images were subsequently used for MPI based thermometry utilizing the "multi-color" method21, 22: MPI ther-
mometry is based on the calibration of the MPI system to differently tempered SPION samples. According system matrices
are acquired deﬁning the temperature range of the SPION that can be detected within an imaging session. Here the lower
base temperature of the sample ("cold channel") and the maximal achieved temperature ("hot channel") were chosen as lower
and upper boundaries. As the MPI signal and the SPION temperature is linear dependant, temperature proﬁles of samples in
a given imaging session can be obtained by reconstructing the MPI signals using both hot and cold channels21. Following
the multi-color method, two system matrices were acquired at temperatures that were assumed to represent the upper ( 43 °C )
and lower (room temperature ( 23 °C )) boundaries of the imaging session. For that, a water bath tempered SPION sample
(synomag-S-90, Micromod Germany, 5mg(Fe)/ml) was placed in a 3D printed sample holder mounted on the computer
controlled sample rod used for system matrix acquisition in our set up . MPI images were reconstructed with the two system
matrices representing base and maximal temperature using the following reconstruction parameters: relative regularization
value: 0.01; number of iterations: 15.
In an experimental set up analog to the one described above, the objective was expanded to include alternating MFH
targets during sequences of MPI-MFH application. Starting with the SPION sample located at the relative position y=-8mm,
the samples were targeted in succession (y=-8mm, y=0mm,y=8mm) while images of all three samples were acquired for the
duration of the measurement (see 8). Reconstruction of MPI-based temperature values was accomplished using the same system
matrices and reconstruction parameters as described in the previous section. The spatial resolution of the temperature maps
originate directly from the imaging parameters.
Variations of ﬂow velocity during MPI-MFH
To study the effect of ﬂow velocity on heating efﬁciency within the MPI-MFH platform, 10 ml of a SPION (synomag-D-70)-
suspension at a concentration of 5mg(Fe)/ml were loaded to a ﬂow system driven by a perfusion pump (PPS2, Multichannel
Systems, Harvard Bioscience Inc.) connected to a loop (loop length= 375cm, inner = 0.2mm, outer = 0.3mm, silicone
tubing, Tygon®) (see ﬁgure 9). The tube was placed at the relative position of x=0 such that the tubing segment serving as the
theranostic target covered almost the entire length of the MPI bore in y-direction while the two ends of the tube were guided
along a 3D printed holder to the pumping device outside the MPI system. Therefore, the relative spatial location of MPI-MFH
target was at x, z = 0, spanning the entire diameter of the MPI’s bore in y- direction. The experimental set up is depicted in
ﬁgure 9 upper left.
An alternating sequence of MFH and MPI (4 block repetitions of 21s MFH and 1s imaging) was used to heat and image at
selected ﬂow velocities the horizontal segment of the tubing. The maximal temperature increase achieved during global heating
(600W) was analyzed for different ﬂow velocities and put in relation to the approximate velocities of differently sized blood
vessels34.
The set up allowed for circulation of the SPION suspension in 0.1ml/min increments. The SPION suspension was pumped at
different ﬂow rates (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6,1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.25, 6, 10, 12 ml/min) corresponding
to circulation velocities of 0.17, 0.25, 0.33, 0.41, 0.50, 0.58, 0.66, 0.74, 0.83, 1.00, 1.07, 1.16, 1.24, 1.32, 1.49, 1.65, 1.86, 4.96,
6.20, 8.26, 10.33 cm/s respectively.
MPI images were acquired with the following parameters: matrix size = 15, 15, 5 (x,y,z), FOV (analog to FOT) = 30, 30, 15
mm (x,y,z), drive ﬁeld strength = 14, 14, 14, mT (x,y,z), focus ﬁeld gradient strength = 1, 1, 2 T/m (x,y,z), drive ﬁeld FOV = 28,
28, 14 mm (x,y,z) , bandwidth = 1.25MHz.
MPI based multi-color reconstruction following the method described in section Interleaved MPI-MFH and MPI ther-
mometry was achieved with the "cold channel" acquired at 23 °C and the "hot channel" acquired at 27 °C using the same
13/18respective parameter values as during image acquisition. The number of measurement averages was set to 50 resulting in a total
acquisition time of approximately 7h 44m. MPI images were subsequently reconstructed with the two system matrices using a
relative regularization value of 0.01 and 15 iterations. Thermal camera pictures have to be considered lower bounds for SPION
temperature, as the tubing’s silicoen wall may act as insulator obscuring the inner temperature from the outside wall.
