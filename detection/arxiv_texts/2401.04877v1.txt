We test ideas of the recently proposed ﬁrst–order thermodyn amics of scalar–tensor gravity using
an exact geometry sourced by a conformally coupled scalar ﬁe ld. We report a non–monotonic
behaviour of the eﬀective “temperature of gravity” not obse rved before and due to a new term
in the equation describing the relaxation of gravity toward its state of equilibrium, i.e., Einstein
gravity, showing a richer range of thermal behaviours of mod iﬁed gravity than previously thought.
I. INTRODUCTION
Einstein’s theory of gravity, General Relativity (GR)
has been very successful in the regimes in which it is
tested [1–4] but there is little doubt that, ultimately, it
has to be replaced by some other theory (of which there
is no shortage [1, 5–8]). First, GR contains spacetime
singularities inside black holes and in cosmology, thus
predicting its own failure. These spacetime singularities
should presumably be cured by quantum mechanics, but
virtually all attempts to introduce quantum corrections
also introduce deviations from GR [9, 10]. The low–
energy limit of the simplest string theory, the bosonic
string, does not reproduce GR but yields ω=−1 Brans–
Dicke gravity instead [11, 12].
In addition to severe observational tensions [13, 14],
fromthetheoreticalpointofviewthestandardGR–based
Λ–Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) model of cosmology[15] is
leftwanting. Itsmainingredient, i.e., thedarkenergyac-
counting for approximately 70% of the energy content of
theuniverse,wasintroducedovernighttoexplainthecur-
rent acceleration of the universe discovered in 1998 with
Type Ia supernovae. The nature of this dark energy is a
mystery. It is believed that, if one explains it with the
cosmological constant Λ, extreme ﬁne–tuning arises. An
alternative to dark energy consists of modifying gravity
at large scales [16, 17]. For this purpose, f(R) theories
of gravity are very popular (see [18–20] for reviews). The
ﬁrst scenario of inﬂation in the early universe, Starobin-
sky inﬂation [21], which is also the scenario favoured by
current observations [22], is based on quadratic correc-
tions to GR, where f(R) =R+αR2(hereRdenotes the
Ricci scalar).
f(R) gravity is a subclass of scalar–tensor gravity, the
prototypeofwhichistheoriginalBrans–Dicketheory[23]
later generalized by various authors [24–27]. These “old”
or “ﬁrst generation” scalar–tensor theories were further
generalized by Horndeski [28]. The past decade has seen
intense research activity on the rediscovered Horndeski
theories, which were believed to be the most general
∗nkarolinski22@ubishops.ca
†vfaraoni@ubishops.cascalar–tensor gravities with second order equations of
motion, avoiding the notorious Ostrogradsky instability
that plagues theories with higher order equations. This
record now belongs to further generalizations, the so–
called DegenerateHigher Order Scalar–Tensor(DHOST)
theories (see, e.g., [29–44] and the references therein).
Fromanotherpointofview,theideahasbeenproposed
that perhaps, unlike the other three known interactions,
gravity is not fundamental but could instead be emer-
gent, similar to the way macroscopic thermodynamics
emerges from microscopic degrees of freedom. This idea
has been pursued in various implementations, see e.g.,
[45–50]. One remarkablepieceofworkis Jacobson’sther-
modynamicsofspacetime, in whichtheEinsteinequation
of GR is derived with purely thermal considerations and
plays a role analogous to that of a macroscopic equation
ofstate [51]. Furthermore, quadratic gravity(which is an
f(R), therefore a scalar–tensor, gravity) can be obtained
in a similar way, but its derivation requires the introduc-
tion of entropy–generationterms [52]. The implication is
that GR is a thermal equilibrium state at zero temper-
ature, while modiﬁed gravity corresponds to an excited
state at higher temperature [52, 53].1Problem is, the
“temperature of gravity” and equations describing the
relaxation to the GR equilibrium have never been found,
in spite of a large literature on spacetime thermodynam-
ics.
Recently, a more modest proposal was advanced in
which this idea of modiﬁed gravity being an excita-
tion of the GR equilibrium is re–examined in a context
completely diﬀerent from Jacobson’s thermodynamics of
spacetime. This new proposal, dubbed “ﬁrst–order ther-
modynamics of scalar–tensor gravity” begins by noticing
that the ﬁeld equations of this class of theories can be
written as eﬀective Einstein equations with an eﬀective
stress–energytensor in their right–hand side acting as an
eﬀective source, which has the structure of a dissipative
ﬂuid. This fact is well–known in special scalar–tensor
theories or for special geometries (especially cosmologi-
cal ones) [54] and it extends to generic “ﬁrst–generation”
1This fact is natural when extra propagating degrees of freed om,
in addition to the two massless spin–two modes of GR, are ex-
cited.2
scalar–tensor theories [55, 56] and to “viable” Horndeski
[57, 58] gravity. Taking this dissipative structure seri-
ously, one attempts to apply Eckart’s ﬁrst–order thermo-
dynamics [59] to it. Rather unexpectedly, the main con-
stitutiverelationofEckart’stheory(ageneralizedFourier
law) is satisﬁed [56], which makes it possible to read oﬀ
this equation the product KTof a “thermal conductiv-
ity of spacetime” Kand of the “temperature of grav-
ity”T[56, 58, 60–64]. GR, obtained when the gravita-
tional Brans–Dicke–like scalar ﬁeld ψis constant, corre-
sponds to KT= 0 while scalar–tensor gravity is a state
atKT>0 [56, 58, 60, 61].
Thus far, this formalism is the closest that one has
cometodeﬁninga“temperatureofgravity”. Anequation
describing the approach to the GR thermal equilibrium,
or the departure from it, is also provided in the formal-
ism [60, 61], which is still under development. The for-
malism has been extended to “viable” Horndeski gravity
[58], applied to cosmology [63, 65], to the Einstein frame
description of these theories [66], and to multi–scalar–
tensor theories [67]. To make progress and gain insight
into this new thermal description of gravity, one needs
to test its basic ideas with special theories of modiﬁed
gravity and their analytic solutions. While this work has
begun[68–71], therearestillmanyopenquestionsandwe
continue this study here by applying the ﬁrst–order ther-
modynamics to a special solution of nonminimally cou-
pled scalar ﬁeld theory (which is a scalar–tensor gravity)
found recently by Sultana [72]. This spacetime is inho-
mogeneous, spherically symmetric, and time–dependent
and is conformal to a GR geometry obtained by Sultana
by generalizing a previous GR solution due to Wyman
[73] to include a (positive) cosmological constant Λ (we
refer to the latter as the Sultana–Wyman solution).
In order to ﬁx the notation, the next section recalls
the basics of scalar–tensor gravity and of nonminimally
coupled scalar ﬁeld theory and introduces Sultana’s solu-
tion, whose geometry has already been studied in detail
in[68]. SectionIIIdiscussestheapproachtotheGRequi-
librium identiﬁed by KT= 0. This discussion includes
a term in the relevant relaxation equation that was set
to zero for simplicity in previous literature. Section IV
makes a brief parallel with an exact solution of Brans–
Dicke theory conformal to the Sultana–Wyman solution,
discussing its thermal properties.
We followthe notationofRef. [74]: the signatureofthe

In the Einstein conformal frame, vacuum scalar–tensor
gravity looks like GR sourced by a minimally coupled
scalar ﬁeld ˜ψ. The conformal transformation is com-
monly used as a solution–generating technique using GR
solutions sourced by minimally coupled scalar ﬁelds as
seeds.3
A. Jordan frame scalar–tensor gravity
The ﬁrst step leading to the ﬁrst–order thermodynam-
ics of scalar–tensor gravity consists of writing the ﬁeld
equations as eﬀective Einstein equations Gab=T(ψ)
abby
collecting all terms other than the Einstein tensor Gabin
the right–hand side. By assuming that ∇aψis timelike
and future–oriented, T(ψ)
abnecessarily has the structure
of a dissipative ﬂuid energy–momentum tensor [74]

The isotropic pressure is decomposed into non–viscous
and viscous contributions,
P=¯P+Pvisc. (2.15)
This dissipative ﬂuid structure is common to all sym-
metric 2–index tensors and, per se, there is no physics
in the decomposition (2.8) [63]. However, by taking
seriously the dissipative ﬂuid structure of T(ψ)
ab, one is
tempted to apply Eckart’s ﬁrst–order thermodynamics
[59] to it. This dissipative ψ–ﬂuid does not, in general,
satisfy energy conditions and it is impossible to identify
unambigously all the thermodynamical quantities famil-
iar from real ﬂuids. However, one can limit oneself to
considering the assumptions of Eckart’s thermodynamics
that relateheatﬂux density, anisotropicstresses, andvis-
cous pressure to the kinematic quantities of the eﬀective
ﬂuid,i.e., the assumed constitutive relations where

four–acceleration, Θ ≡ ∇cucis the expansion scalar, and
σab=hachbd∇(cud) (2.19)
is the shear tensor, while ζandηare eﬀective bulk and
shear viscosity coeﬃcients. It is a miracle that the eﬀec-
tiveψ–ﬂuid satisﬁes Eckart’s constitutive relation (2.16)
(withhab∇bT= 0). This fact allows one to identify the
product of a “thermal conductivity” Kand a “tempera-
ture”Tof gravity as [60, 61]
KT=√−∇cψ∇cψ

GR, obtained for ψ= const., corresponds to thermal
equilibrium at KT= 0. The approach to (or departure
from) this GR equilibrium is described by [61]

Nonminimal coupling ( i.e.,ξ/negationslash= 0) seems to have been
originally introduced in the context of radiation prob-
lems in curved space [75]. It is unavoidable when quan-
tizing a scalar ﬁeld on a curved background ([76], see4
also [77–81]). The value ξ= 1/6 (conformal coupling)
makes Eq. (2.25) conformally invariant if V(φ) is quartic
oridentically zero. Froma classicalpoint ofview, confor-
malcouplingisnecessarytoavoidcausalpathologies, i.e.,
the propagation of a massive scalar ﬁeld φstrictly along
the light cone [82]. ξ= 1/6 is also an infrared ﬁxed point
of the renormalization group in Grand Uniﬁed Theories
[83–89].

(2.31)Here we are interested in a particular solution for a
conformally coupled scalar ﬁeld to elucidate features of
the ﬁrst–order thermodynamics of scalar–tensor gravity.
The starting point is a solution of GR with a minimally
coupled ( i.e.,ξ= 0) scalar ﬁeld found by Wyman2[73]
d˜s2=−κr2dt2+2dr2+r2dΩ2
(2), (2.32)
˜φ(t) =˜φ0t, (2.33)
wheredΩ2
(2)≡dϑ2+sin2ϑdϕ2is the line element on the
unit 2–sphere and ˜φ0is a constant. Wyman’s “other”
solution coincides with a special case of interior solutions
for relativistic stars with a stiﬀ ﬂuid found by Iba˜ nez &
Sanz[90]in1982,previouslystudiedbyBuchdahl&Land
[91]. Thisis, inturn, aspecialcaseoftheTolmanIVclass
of solutions of the Einstein equations discovered in 1939
[92–94]. The matching with an exterior GR solution was
studied in [95].
The Sultana geometry with Λ >0 [72] coincides with
another special case of a class of perfect ﬂuid solutions
given by Iba˜ nez & Sanz. It should probably be called
Buchdahl-Land-Sultana-Wyman-Iba˜ nez-Sanz(BLSWIS)
solution. More precisely, this BLSWIS metric is a special
limit of Buchdahl & Land’s [91] stiﬀ ﬂuid solution of the
Einstein equations with vanishing cosmological constant
but pressure
P=ρ−ρ0 (2.34)
(whereρis the ﬂuid energy density and ρ0is a constant),
whichissupposedtodescribeanincompressibleﬂuidbut,
in practice, a cosmological constant is re–introduced.
The more general Buchdahl–Land solution constitutes
a special case of the Tolman IV class of solutions [93]
describing the interior of a perfect ﬂuid ball with cosmo-
logical constant [92].
Sultana [72] generalized the Wyman solution to the
case in which there is a positive cosmological constant Λ.
This geometry (that we refer to as the Sultana–Wyman
solution of GR) can be regarded as the Einstein frame
versionofa Jordanframesolution ofconformallycoupled
scalarﬁeldtheory. Then, theinverseconformalmapfrom
the Einstein to the Jordan frame produces a new vacuum
solution of this theory (which is, of course, conformal to
the Sultana–Wyman solution of GR), here referred to as
the Sultana solution.
The inhomogeneous, spherically symmetric, and time–
dependent Sultana solution of conformallycoupled scalar
2Thisissometimescalled Wyman’s “other” solution to distin guish
it from the better–known solution discovered by Fisher [96] and
rediscovered over and over again [73, 97–99]. The latter is t he
general solution of the Λ = 0 Einstein equations which is stat ic,
spherically symmetric, asymptotically ﬂat, and with a free scalar
ﬁeld as the source (see the recent review [100]).5

frame is the Higgs potential [72]

In general, the conformal map between Jordan and Ein-
stein frames produces scalar ﬁeld potentials that are not
physically motivated, but this is not the case here. V(φ)
is non–negative since (following [72]) we assume Λ ≥0.
The eﬀective gravitational coupling strength (2.27) is
kept positive by requiring that −φc< φ < φ c, where
φc≡α−1=/radicalbig
6/κis a critical scalar ﬁeld value. With
this potential, the action (2.23) is invariant under the
exchangeφ→ −φ.
The Sultana geometry exhibits a spacetime singularity
arr= 0, where the Kretschmann scalar
RabcdRabcd=3+2cosh(αt)+cosh(4αt)
3r4cosh8(αt)(2.38)
diverges [72].
The nature of the Sultana–Wyman solution of GR was
studied in detail in Ref. [101], which analyzes its radial
null geodesics. Since the Sultana geometry (2.35), (2.36)
is conformal to the Sultana–Wyman geometry of GR its
causal structure, which is conformally invariant, is the
same. In particular, the singularity at r= 0, where the
curvature invariants diverge, persists. This is a naked
singularity because no apparent horizons cover it. The
equation locating all the apparent horizons, when they
exist, is∇cR∇cR= 0, where Ris the areal radius [102]
and this equation does not admit solutions in the Sultana
spacetime [101].
The gradient of the scalar ﬁeld (2.36)

∇aφ∇aφ=−1
κr2cosh6(αt)<0 (2.40)

cannot be used to deﬁne an eﬀective ﬂuid four–velocity)
unless the negative sign is adopted in Eq. (2.36), whichwe do here:3hence from now on φ(t) =−α−1tanh(αt)
andψ= 1−α2φ2. With this choice, the four–velocity of

consistent with the equation of motion of φ. However,
/squareψ/negationslash= 0 and the last term on the right–hand side of
Eq. (2.21) does not vanish, allowing for a more generic
test of the basic ideas of Refs. [56, 58, 60–64].
As is clear from Eq. (3.6), KT →+∞asr→0+: the
nakedspacetimesingularityat r= 0is“hot”,inthesense
that gravity departs from GR there, and the deviation is
inﬁnite. In the inﬁnite past, τ→ −∞(alsot→ −∞),
φ(τ) approaches a constant and KTtends to zero, thus
gravityapproachesGR asymptotically(Fig. 1). This fact
isconsistentwith the ideathat gravity“cools”as3–space
expands. In fact, the ﬁnite volume of 3–space is

monotonically, diverging again as τ→+∞.
SinceKT →0+andV(3)→+∞asτ→ −∞, the Sul-
tana solution corroborates the idea that the expansion
of space “cools” gravity, even when the third term/squareψ
κψ
in Eq. (2.21) does not vanish and for non–cosmological
spacetimes in which 3–space still expands. The eﬀec-
tive gravitational coupling Geﬀ=G
1−(φ/φc)2→+∞as
τ→ −∞andφ→ −φc. Thus far, based on previous
exact solution examples, singularities of Geﬀhave been
regarded on par with spacetime singularities where grav-
ity becomes “hot”. As the Sultana solution shows, this
picture is at least incomplete because here Geﬀ, which
depends only on time, diverges where 3–space expands
without limit, but gravity “cools” instead. The eﬀect
of 3–space expansion dominates over divergences of the
gravitational coupling. In the end, it is the product
GeﬀT(φ)
abthat enters the right–hand side of the ﬁeld equa-
tions, so whether gravity approaches GR or departs from
it is determined by the vanishing of this product and not
by the individual factors GeﬀandT(φ)
ab.
Increasing KTmeans increasing deviation from GR:
we have
d(KT)
d¯τ≡uc∇c(KT) =uτd(KT)
dτ,(3.10)
where ¯τis the proper time along the ﬂuid lines of the ef-
fectiveφ–ﬂuid. The normalization ucuc=−1 (or, alter-
natively, the transformation property uτ=∂τ
∂tut) gives
uτ= 1/(√κr) and
d(KT)
d¯τ=1√κrd(KT)
dτ=α2τ2−1
3√κr(1+α2τ2)2.(3.11)
KT(τ,r) increases for −∞< τ <−α−1, where it has
a maximum KTmax=1√
6κrand decreases for −α−1<
τ <0, vanishing as τ→0−and changing concavity at
τ=−√
3α. Therefore, gravity is extremely close to GR
in the far past, then it gradually departs from it but
only to a ﬁnite extent ( KTremains ﬁnite at all radii
r >0), then approaches GR again, coinciding with it
atτ= 0. To the best of our knowledge, all analytic
solutions of scalar–tensorgravity studied thus far exhibit
instead a monotonic approach to, or departure from, the
GR equilibrium state.
The third term/squareψ
κψin the right–hand side of Eq. (2.21)
is responsible for the non–monotonic behaviour of KT
and dominates near τ= 0. It is possible for gravity
to depart from GR and return to it after a temporary
deviation, a behaviour that was not observed before in
the literature, which was limited to examples in which
/squareψ= 0.IV. A RELATED SOLUTION OF
BRANS–DICKE AND f(R)GRAVITY
It is useful to contrastthe thermal behaviourofgravity
in the Sultana geometry with the one of other solutions
in which /squareψ= 0. To this end, we choose a recent solu-
tion of Brans–Dicke theory closely related to the Sultana
spacetime of the previous sections, for which the thermal
evolution of gravity has not been discussed.
A family of solutions of Brans–Dicke gravity was gen-
erated in Ref. [101] using the conformal transformation
from Einstein to Jordan frame and the Sultana–Wyman
geometry as a seed, obtaining

whereτ∗andψ∗are constants related to the initial con-
ditions. The Jordan frame scalar ﬁeld potential is the
simple mass term
V(ψ) =m2ψ2

κ. (4.3)
This geometry is also a solution of pure R2gravity,
which is given by the action
Sf(R)=/integraldisplay

where [101]
f(R) =κ
4ΛR2(4.5)
and the eﬀective scalar ﬁeld is ψ=f′(R) =κR/(2Λ).
This theory does not have a Newtonian limit around a
ﬂat background [103] (although it admits one around de
Sitter backgrounds [104]), but approximates Starobinsky
inﬂation in f(R) =R+αR2gravity at high curvatures.
Since

singularity in a background created by the cosmologi-
cal constant, now morphed into the Jordan frame V(ψ).

V. CONCLUSIONS
In previousliterature on the ﬁrst–orderthermodynam-
ics of scalar–tensorgravity[56, 58, 60–64], Eq. (2.21) was
always studied in situations in which /squareψ= 0 to simplify
the analysis. Two key ideas of this formalism emerged in
this context: a) spacetime singularities are “hot”; b) the
expansion of 3–space “cools” gravity [56, 58, 60–64]. Are
these ideas valid only in the limited context /squareψ= 0 or
are they generic? Thus far, there is no known exam-
ple in which the third term on the right–hand side of
Eq. (2.21), proportional to /squareψ/ψ, is non–vanishing and
is allowed to play a role. It is interesting to learn how
it can aﬀect the evolution of KTand the Sultana solu-
tion (3.4), (3.5) for a conformally coupled scalar ﬁeld in
the Higgs potential (2.37) allowed us to do just that. In
this geometry, gravity is asymptotically Einstein gravity
in the far past, then deviates from it but only by a ﬁnite
extent (i.e., by a ﬁnite KT), and returns to GR. This is a
new behaviourdue to the term/squareψ
κψ: all example solutions
previously examined show a monotonic relaxation to GR
or departure from it, as exempliﬁed by the Brans–Dicke
geometry of Sec. IV.4
In the general theory, it is not possible to predict a pri-
orithesignof/squareψ
κψand, therefore,itscoolingorheatingef-
fect on gravity. Specifying the functions V(ψ) andω(ψ),
assuming ∇cto be timelike, and restricting to 2 ω+3>0
4It can be regarded as a Brans–Dicke cousin of the Sultana solu -
tion since, like the latter, it is conformal to the Sultana–W yman
geometry.in order to avoid a phantom ﬁeld ψseems to help, for
then Eq. (2.3) yields
/squareψ
κψ=ψV′−2V+ω′|∇cψ∇cψ|
κψ|2ω+3|,(5.1)
where a prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to ψ
and, of course, ψ >0 to ensure that Geﬀ>0 (we have
inserted an absolute value to make explicit the sign of
the term containing ∇cψ∇cψ <0). For given V(φ) and
ω(φ) (often,ωis constant), it is possible to predict the
sign of/squareψ/ψbut whether this term dominates or not,
or whether it vanishes asymptotically cannot be decided
a priori. To conclude, although the two key ideas of
the ﬁrst-order thermodynamics of scalar–tensor gravity
are corroborated, the full range of possible behaviours of
gravity is richer.
