for properness of the H2-action on the homogeneous space G/H1in the
cases where Gadmits a suitable isometric action on a metric space. In

•For a given locally-compact group G, study pairs ( H1,H2) of
closed subgroups of Gsuch that the H2-action on the homoge-
neous space G/H1is proper (or equivalently, the H1-action on
the homogeneous space G/H2is proper).
It should be noted that for a pair of closed subgroups ( H1,H2) ofG,
if one ofH1andH2is compact, then the H2-action on G/H1should be
proper. However, in the cases where H1andH2are both non-compact,
the action is not needed to be proper. For an extremal example, if w e
take (G,H1) = (SO0(n+ 1,1),SO0(n,1)), then for any non-compact
closed subgroup H2ofG, theH2-action on G/H1fails to be proper
(Calabi–Markus phenomenon [8]).
Asystematicinvestigationofthethemeabovefornon-compactclo sed
subgroups( H1,H2)inareductivegroup GwasinitiatedbyT.Kobayashi’s
works [19, 20, 21] in the 1980s, as studies of discontinuous groups and
Cliﬀord–Klein forms for homogeneous spaces G/Hof reductive type,
and has been developed by many researchers in various approache s (see
summaries [24] and[25, Section 4]given by T. Kobayashi for thedet ails
of discontinuous groups and Cliﬀord–Klein forms).
In this paper, as one of the fundamental problems in the research
theme above, we focus on the following problem:
Problem 1.1. For a given locally-compactgroup Gand a pair (H1,H2)
of closed subgroups of G, ﬁnd a good criterion for properness of the H2-
action on the homogeneous space G/H1.
It should be emphasized that to prove the properness of the H2-
action on G/H1, as we will see in Section 2.1, we need to check that
the subset
H1∩(D·H2·D−1)
ofGis compact for any compact subset DofG. Such the problem
might not be easy in many situations.
Now, for real linear reductive Lie group G, we state Kobayashi’s
properness criterion as follows:
Theorem 1.2 (Kobayashi [19, 22]; see also Theorem 2.5 for the de-
tailed version) .LetGbe a real linear reductive Lie group and we ﬁx
a Cartan’s KAK-decomposition G=KAK. The Lie algebra of Ais
denoted by a. Then for a pair (H1,H2)of closed subgroups of G, the
H2-action on G/H1is proper if and only if the intersection
a(H1)∩(a(H2)+D)
is compact for any compact subset Dofa, where we put
a(H) :={X∈a|(K·(expX)·K)∩H/\e}a⊔io\slash=∅} ⊂a
for each non-empty subset HofG.KOBAYASHI’S PROPERNESS CRITERION 3
In the setting of Theorem 1.2, ais just a ﬁnite-dimensional vector
space, and a(H1) anda(H2) are both subsets of a. Further, we only
need to consider closed balls as compact subsets Dina(withrespect to
aﬁxedinner-producton a). Therefore, theconditionstatedinTheorem
1.2 is much easier than the original one.
In the cases where H1andH2are both reductive subgroups of G,
then by taking inner-conjugations of H1andH2inG, one can choose
a(H1) anda(H2) to be a ﬁnite union of linear subspaces of a(see [19]
for more details), and thus we do not need to consider compact sub sets
Dofa. In particular, in such a situation, the H2-action on G/H1is
proper if and only if the H2-action on G/H1has the property (CI),
that is the isotropy subgroup of H2is compact at any point in G/H1.
Kobayashi’s properness criterion is a fundamental tool to study d is-
continuous groups and Cliﬀord–Klein forms of homogeneous spaces
G/Hof reductive type. As one of important applications, a crite-
rion for the Calabi–Markus phenomenon on G/Hwas given in [19,
Corollary 4.3], that is, he showed that a homogeneous space G/Hof
reductive type admits an inﬁnite discontinuous group if and only if
rankRG >rankRH. Further, one can ﬁnd plenty of applications of
Kobayashi’s properness criterion by many researchers (for exam ple,
[5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 26, 28, 30, 31, 33, 35]).
It should be remarked that Y. Benoist [4] also proved a claim which
is essentially the same as Theorem 1.2 inspired by Kobayashi’s earlier
work in [19]. Furthermore, he also gave a similar criterion for the case s
whereGis a semisimple algebraic group over a non-Archimedean local
ﬁelds (See also Remark 2.11).
We also give a remark as follows: Let Kbe a closed Lie subgroup of
the orthogonal group O(n), and deﬁne the semi-direct product group
G:=K⋉Rn. Then some types of properness criterions are given by
T. Yoshino [39] for closed subgroups of Gin the cases where Gis a
Cartan motion group associated to a real reductive Lie group, and by
A. Baklouti, S. Bejar and R. Fendri [1] for general G=K⋉ Rnand
pairs of connected or discrete subgroups of G(see also Remark 2.10 in
Section 2.4).
As other situations, studies of relationships between properness and
the property (CI) for pairs of closed subgroups of solvable or nilpo tent
Lie groups can be found in [2, 3, 27, 29, 36, 37, 38].
WenotethattheproofsofTheorem2.5givenbyKobayashiin[19,22 ]
are based on structure theory of real linear reductive Lie groups . The
purpose of this paper is to understand Theorem 2.5 in terms of metr ic
geometry.
In this paper, we say that a metric space ( M,d) is proper if any
closed ball in Mis compact. As our main results, we will prove claims
similar toTheorem 1.2(see Theorems 2.8 and2.9 inSection 2.4), inthe
cases where Gis a locally-compact group admitting a proper isometric4 KENTO OGAWA, TAKAYUKI OKUDA
transitive action on a proper metric space ( M,d) with the following
property:
Property (S): For each r≥0, there exists τ(r)≥0 such that
for anyp0,p,q∈Mwithd(p,p0)≤r, one can choose an
isometry g∈Gwithg·p=p0andd(q,g·q)≤τ(r).
Roughly, Property (S) on the G-spaceMstated above means that
for any triple p0,p,qof points in M, one can choose a point q0inM
such that the segments pqandp0q0areG-conjugate to each other and
the distance d(q,q0) is bounded in some sense.
We will give a suﬃcient condition on a metric G-spaceMfor Prop-
erty (S) in terms of geometry of CAT(0) spaces (see Section 5). F ur-
thermore, Theorem 1.2 can be explained in terms of CAT(0) metric
geometry on Riemannian symmetric spaces without compact factor s
(see Section 6).
1.1.Organization of the paper. This paper is organized as follows:
In Section 2, we set up our notations of proper pairs and HBI-pairs .
Further, we state Kobayashi’s properness criterion in the form of [22]
and our main results. In Section 3, we consider non-expanding maps
between proper metric spaces and study the relationship between HBI-
pairs via the map. In the same section, we also discuss that for an
isometric action on a proper metric space of a compact group, the
space of orbits can be considered as a proper metric space and the
quotient map is non-expanding. Our main theorems 2.8 and 2.9 will
be proved in Section 4. In Section 5, a suﬃcient condition on a metric
homogeneousspaceforProperty(S)isgivenintermsofCAT(0)sp aces.
Finally, in Section 6, we discuss that Kobayashi’s properness criterio n
(Theorem 2.5) can be explained by combining Theorem 2.9 with some
facts for metric geometry on Riemannian symmetric spaces.
2.Kobayashi’s properness criterion and main results of
this paper
In this section, we set up our terminologies and state Kobayashi’s
properness criterion in the form of [22] and the main results of this
paper.
2.1.Proper pairs inlocally-compact groups. TostateKobayashi’s
properness criterion given in [22], we shall ﬁx our terminologies as be-
low: Let Gbe a locally-compact group. For a subset HofGand a
compact subset DofG, we put
ND(H) :=D·H·D−1
={d1·h·d−1
2∈G|d1,d2∈D,h∈H}.KOBAYASHI’S PROPERNESS CRITERION 5
For two non-empty subsets H1andH2ofG, we denote by H1∼H2if
there exists a compact subset DofGsuch that
H1⊂ND(H2) andH2⊂ND(H1).
Then “∼” deﬁnes an equivalent binary relation on the set P×(G) of
all non-empty subsets of G. The equivalent class of H∈ P×(G) will
be denoted by [ H], and the quotient set of P×(G) by the equivalent
relation∼is written as [ P×(G)].
The following proposition is pointed out by Kobayashi [19, 20]:
Proposition 2.1. Let(H1,H2)be a pair of closed subgroups of G.
Then the following conditions on (H1,H2)are equivalent:
(i)TheH2-action on the homogeneous space G/H1is proper.
(ii)TheH1-action on the homogeneous space G/H2is proper.
(iii)The(H1×H2)-actionon the groupmanifold G= (G×G)/(diagG)
is proper, where diagG:={(g,g)|g∈G}.
(iv)For anyH′
1∈[H1]and anyH′
2∈[H2], the intersection H′
1∩H′
2
is relatively compact in G.
Motivated by the fact above, for an arbitrary pair ( H1,H2) of non-
empty subsets of G, we say that ( H1,H2) is proper in G, and write
H1⋔H2inG( or [H1]⋔[H2] inG)
if for any H′
1∈[H1] and any H′
2∈[H2], the intersection H′
1∩H′
2is
relatively-compact in G.
Note that the following proposition gives necessary and suﬃcient
conditions for a pair ( H1,H2) to be proper in G:
Proposition 2.2. LetH1andH2be non-empty subsets of G. Then
the following four conditions are equivalent:
(i)The pair (H1,H2)is proper in G.
(ii)For any compact subset DofG, the intersection ND(H1)∩H2
is relatively compact in G.
(iii)For any compact subset DofG, the intersection H1∩ND(H2)
is relatively compact in G.
(iv)For any compact subsets D1andD2ofG, the intersection
ND1(H1)∩ND2(H2)is relatively compact in G.
Proof of Proposition 2.2. The arguments in the proof of Proposition
2.6 also work to prove Proposition 2.2 as below. The equivalence (i)
⇔(iv), the implications (i) ⇒(ii) and (i) ⇒(iii) are all easy to prove.
The implications (ii) ⇒(iv) and (iii) ⇒(iv) comes immediately from
the inclusions
ND1(H1)∩ND2(H2)⊂ND1(H1∩ND−1
1·D2(H2)),
ND1(H1)∩ND2(H2)⊂ND2(ND−1
2·D1(H1)∩H2)
for compact subsets D1andD2ofG, respectively. /square6 KENTO OGAWA, TAKAYUKI OKUDA
For each non-empty subset HofG, let us deﬁne
⋔(H:G) :={H′∈ P×(G)|H⋔H′inG},
⋔([H] :G) :={H′∈[P×(G)]|[H]⋔H′inG}.
Inthecaseswhere Gisσ-compact, thatis, Gisaunionofacountable
family of compact subsets of G, the following holds:
Proposition 2.3 (Yoshino [40]) .Suppose that Gisσ-compact. Then
for two non-empty subsets H1andH2ofG, the three conditions below
are equivalent:
(i)H1∼H2inG.
(ii)⋔(H1:G) =⋔(H2:G).
(iii)⋔([H1] :G) =⋔([H2] :G).
Proof of Proposition 2.3. The implication (i) ⇒(ii) and the equiva-
lence (ii) ⇔(iii) are both trivial. We shall prove the contraposition of
the implication (ii) ⇒(i). Assume that H1/\e}a⊔io\slash∼H2. Without loss of the
generalities, one can suppose that
H1/\e}a⊔io\slash⊂ND(H2)
for any compact subset DofG. SinceGisσ-compact and locally-
compact, as is well-known that one can ﬁnd a sequence {Dn}n∈Z≥0of
compact subsets of Gsatisfying that
•Dnis a neighborhood of the unit of Gfor eachn,
•Dn⊂D◦
n+1foreachn, whereD◦
n+1denotestheinteriorof Dn+1

•G=/uniontext
nDn.
Note that for any compact subset DofG, there exists k∈Z≥0with
D⊂DkandD⊂NDk(H2). Let us ﬁx a point
gn∈H1\NDn(H2)
for eachn∈Z≥0, and deﬁne H′:={gn|n∈Z≥0}. Then the intersec-
tion
H′∩H1=H′
is not relatively compact in GsinceH′/\e}a⊔io\slash⊂NDk(H2) for any k∈Z≥0.
Therefore, the pair ( H1,H′) is not proper in G. On the other hand, for
any compact subset DofG, the intersection H′∩ND(H2) is compact
since
H′∩ND(H2)⊂H′∩NDk(H2) ={gk|k≤n}.
for some k∈Z≥0withD⊂Dk. Thus, the pair ( H2,H′) is proper in
Gby Proposition 2.2. This proves ⋔(H1:G)/\e}a⊔io\slash=⋔(H2:G). /square
We also remark that the following proposition gives a suﬃcient con-
dition for σ-compactness of G:KOBAYASHI’S PROPERNESS CRITERION 7

Then the map πis proper. Since dis a proper metric on M, for each
r≥0, the closed ball Nr(∗) is compact, and thus Dr:=π−1(Nr(∗))
too. This proves that

2.2.Kobayashi’s properness criterion. We shall state Kobayashi’s
properness criterion given in [22]. Let Gbe a real linear reductive Lie
group and θa Cartan involution of G. We write K:=Gθfor the ﬁxed
point subgroup of Gbyθ, which is a maximal compact subgroup of
G. For the Lie algebra gofG, the Cartan decomposition on ginduced
byθis denoted by g=k+p. We choose a maximal abelian subspace
aofp. Then we have a Cartan’s KAK-decomposition G=K·A·K,
whereA:= exp(a) denotes the connected abelian analytic subgroup
ofGwith respect to a. We denote by W:=NK(a)/ZK(a) the Weyl
group acting on a. For each non-empty subset HofG, we deﬁne the
non-empty W-invariant subset a(H) ofaby
a(H) :={X∈a|(K·exp(X)·K)∩H/\e}a⊔io\slash=∅}.
Thena(H) is a non-empty W-stable subset of a, andH∼exp(a(H))
inG.
Let us consider aas a locally-compact additive group (with respect
to the standard Hausdorﬀ topology on a). On the set P×(a)Wof all
non-empty W-invariant subsets of a, we deﬁne the equivalent relation
∼and proper pairs in P×(a)Was in the sense mentioned above. For
eachC∈ P×(a)W, we deﬁne
⋔(C:a)W:={C′∈ P×(a)W|C⋔C′ina} ⊂ P×(a)W.
Then Kobayashi’s properness criterion in [22] can be stated as fol-
lows:
Theorem 2.5 (Kobayashi [22, Theorems 3.4 and 5.6]) .Let(H1,H2)
be a pair of non-empty subsets of a real linear reductive Lie g roupG.

is proper in a, that is, for any compact subset Dofa, the intersec-
tion
a(H1)∩(a(H2)+D)
is relatively-compact in a.
(2) The following four conditions on (H1,H2)are equivalent:8 KENTO OGAWA, TAKAYUKI OKUDA
(2a)H1∼H2inG.
(2b)a(H1)∼a(H2)ina.
(2c)⋔(H1:G) =⋔(H1:G)
(2d)⋔(a(H1) :a)W=⋔(a(H2) :a)W.
2.3.HBI-pairs in proper metric spaces. Let (M,d) be a proper
metric space, that is, ( M,d) is a metric space such that any closed ball
inMis compact. Note that a subset of Mis bounded in Mif and only
if relatively-compact in M.
In this subsection, to state our main results, we introduce the con -
cepts of “HBI-pairs” of non-empty subsets of Mas below:
For each subset CofMand each r≥0, we deﬁne the subset Nr(C)
ofMby
Nr(C) :={p∈M|d(p,c)≤rfor some c∈C}.
In this paper, for two non-empty subsets C1andC2ofM, we write
C1∼C2if there exists r≥0 such that
C1⊂Nr(C2) andC2⊂Nr(C1).
Note that C1∼C2if and only if the Hausdorﬀ distance between C1
andC2is ﬁnite. Then “ ∼” deﬁnes an equivalent binary relation on
the setP×(M) of all non-empty subsets of M. For each non-empty
subsetC, we write [ C] for the equivalent class of C. Furthermore, the
quotient set of P×(M) by∼is denoted by [ P×(M)].
Throughout this paper, for two non-empty subsets C1andC2of
M,we say that the pair ( C1,C2) isHBIinMif for any C′
1∈[C1] and
anyC′
2∈[C2], the intersection C′
1∩C′
2is bounded in M. In such a
case, the pair ([ C1],[C2]) in [P×(M)] is also said to be HBI in M.
The proposition below gives necessary and suﬃcient conditions for
a pair (C1,C2) to be HBI in M.
Proposition 2.6. LetC1andC2be both non-empty subsets of M.
Then the following four conditions on (C1,C2)are equivalent:
(i)The pair (C1,C2)is HBI in M.
(ii)For anyr≥0, the intersection C1∩Nr(C2)is bounded in M.
(iii)For anyr≥0, the intersection Nr(C1)∩C2is bounded in M.
(iv)Foranyr1,r2≥0, the intersection Nr1(C1)∩Nr2(C2)is bounded
inM.
Proof of Proposition 2.6. The equivalence (i) ⇔(iv), the implications
(i)⇒(ii) and (i) ⇒(iii) are all easy to prove. The implications (ii) ⇒
(iv) and (iii) ⇒(iv) comes immediately from the inclusions
Nr1(C1)∩Nr2(C2)⊂Nr1(C1∩Nr1+r2(C2)),
Nr1(C1)∩Nr2(C2)⊂Nr2(Nr1+r2(C1)∩C2)
forr1,r2≥0, respectively. /squareKOBAYASHI’S PROPERNESS CRITERION 9
For each non-empty subset CofM, let us deﬁne
HBI(C:M) :={C′∈ P×(M)|the pair ( C,C′) is HBI in M},
HBI([C] :M) :={C′∈[P×(M)]|the pair ([ C],C′) is HBI in M}.
Then, similarly to Proposition 2.4, the proposition below holds:
Proposition 2.7. For two non-empty subsets C1andC2ofM, the
following three conditions are equivalent:
(i)C1∼C2inM.
(ii)HBI(C1:M) =HBI(C2:M).
(iii)HBI([C1] :M) =HBI([C2] :M).
Proof of Proposition 2.7. The implication (i) ⇒(ii) and the equiva-
lence (ii) ⇔(iii) are both trivial. We shall prove the contraposition of
the implication (ii) ⇒(i). Assume that C1/\e}a⊔io\slash∼C2. Without loss of the
generalities, one can suppose that
C1/\e}a⊔io\slash⊂Nr(C2)
for anyr≥0. For each n∈Z≥0, one can ﬁnd and do take pn∈
C1\Nn(C2). Let us put C′:={pn|n∈Z≥0}. Then the intersection
C′∩C1=C′
is not bounded in M. Therefore, the pair ( C1,C′) is not HBI in M.
However, the intersection C′∩Nr(C2) is ﬁnite for any r≥0, and
thus the pair ( C2,C′) is HBI in Mby Proposition 2.6. This proves
HBI(C1:M)/\e}a⊔io\slash=HBI(C2:M). /square
2.4.Main results. We shall state our results as below: Let ( M,d) be
a proper metric space and Ga locally-compact group acting continu-
ously, properly, isometrically and transitively on M. As in Section 1,
suppose that the metric G-spaceMhas the following property:
Property (S): For each r≥0, there exists τ(r)≥0 such that
for anyp0,p,q∈Mwithd(p,p0)≤r, one can choose an
isometry g∈Gwithg·p=p0andd(q,g·q)≤τ(r).
Let us ﬁx a base point ∗ofMand denote by Kthe compact isotropy
subgroup of Gat the point ∗ofM. The space of K-orbits in Mis

metricdonM(see Section 3.2 for the deﬁnition of the metric dKon
K\M). We deﬁne the map µ:G→K\Mby
µ:G→K\M, g/maps⊔o→K·(g·∗).
One of our main results is stated below:

subsets of G.10 KENTO OGAWA, TAKAYUKI OKUDA

(2) The following four conditions on (H1,H2)are equivalent:

(2-b)µ(H1)∼µ(H2)inK\M.
(2-c)⋔(H1:G) =⋔(H2:G).
(2-d)HBI(µ(H1) :K\M) =HBI(µ(H2) :K\M).
In addition, let us ﬁx Σ as a closed subset of Msatisfying the fol-
lowing two conditions:
•For each K-orbitOinM, the intersection Σ ∩Ois non-empty.
•For each pair of K-orbits (O1,O2) inM, there exists ( p,q)∈
(Σ∩O1)×(Σ∩O2) such that d(p,q) =dK(O1,O2).
We write
η: Σ→K\M, p/maps⊔o→K·p
for the restriction of the quotient map, and deﬁne
Θ :P×(Σ)→ P×(Σ), S/maps⊔o→η−1(η(S)).
Then Θ2= Θ onP×(Σ). Let us put
P×(Σ)Θ:={S∈ P×(Σ)|Θ(S) =S} ⊂ P×(Σ).
By considering the restriction of d, the set Σ itself is a proper metric
space. For each S∈ P×(Σ)Θ, we write
HBI(S: Σ)Θ:={S′∈ P×(Σ)Θ|the pair ( S,S′) is HBI in Σ }.
Furthermore, for each non-empty subset HofG, we deﬁne the non-
empty Θ-ﬁxed subset Σ( H) of Σ by
Σ(H) :={p∈Σ|(K·p)∩(H·∗)/\e}a⊔io\slash=∅},

We will discuss that Kobayashi’s properness criterion (Theorem 2.5)
can be explained by combining Theorem 2.9 with some facts for metric
geometry on Riemannian symmetric spaces without compact factor s
(see Section 6).
Remark 2.10. Let us ﬁx n∈Z≥0and a closed Lie subgroup Kof the
orthogonal group O(n). We deﬁne the Lie group G:=K⋉Rnas the
semi-direct product of Kand the additive Lie group Rn. ThenGhas
the proper isomeric transitive action on the n-dimensional Euclidean
spaceM:=Rn, and one can easily to check that the G-spaceMhas
Property (S). Therefore, Theorem 2.8 (more precisely, Theo rem 4.5
stated in Section 4) works for G:=K⋉Rn. It should be remarked that
the properness criterion for pairs of connected or discrete subgroups of
Ggiven by Baklouti–Bejar–Fendri [1, Theorem 3.9] is related to our
works in the sense above. Furthermore, if we take a cross-sec tionΣ
ofRnfor theK-representation on Rn, then Theorem 2.9 also works.
This contains Yoshino’s properness criterion [39, Theorem 9] for the
pair of subsets of a Cartan motion group G=K⋉Rnassociated to a
real linear reductive group.
Remark 2.11. As we mentioned in Section 1, similarly to Theorem
2.5(1), Benoist [4]gave a properness criterion for pairs of closed sub-
groups of a simply-connected semisimple algebraic group Gover a non-
Archimedean local ﬁeld k. We believe that his criterion can be explained
by applying Theorem 2.9 to the isometric G-action on the Bruhat–Tits
building B(G;k)ofGand an apartment ΣofB(G;k). This will be
explored in detail in a future work.
Remark 2.12. Gu´ eritaud–Kassel [12, Theorem 1.8] proved that a dis-
continuous group for the group manifold PO(n,1)should be “sharp”
(see[18]for the deﬁnition of sharpness of discontinuous groups) und er
a suitable assumption. Their method is based on metric geome try on
the hyperbolic spaces. We are also interested in sharpness o f discontin-
uous groups and in a future work, we will investigate such pro blems in
our setting.
3.Non-expanding proper surjective maps and HBI-pairs
Let (Ω,d) and (Ω′,d′) be both proper metric spaces. In this section,
we consider a continuous proper surjective map η: Ω→Ω′satisfying
the following two conditions:
Condition (1): The map η: Ω→Ω′is non-expanding, that is,
d′(η(x),η(y))≤d(x,y)
holds for any x,y∈Ω.
Condition (2): For each x∈Ω andy′∈Ω′, there exists y∈
η−1(y′) such that
d(x,y) =d′(η(x),y′).12 KENTO OGAWA, TAKAYUKI OKUDA
For each subset Cof Ω, we deﬁne the subset Θ( C) of Ω by
Θ(C) :=η−1(η(C))⊂Ω.
Then Θ gives a transformation on the set P×(Ω) of all non-empty
subsets of Ω. Furthermore, one can see that Θ2= Θ and Θ preserves
inclusions.
In this section, we give a relationship between some types of HBI-
pairs in Ω and those in Ω′viaη(see Theorem 3.1), and such the
theorem can be applied for spaces of compact group orbits in prope r
metric spaces (see Section 3.2).
3.1.A relationship between HBI-pairsvianon-expanding maps.
The purpose of this subsection is to give a proof of the following theo -
rem, which gives a relationship between some types of HBI-pairs in Ω
and those in Ω′viaη:
Theorem 3.1. LetC1andC2be both non-empty subsets of Ω.
(1) IfC1∼C2inΩ, thenΘ(C1)∼Θ(C2)inΩ.
(2) The following two conditions on (C1,C2)are equivalent:
(2a)Θ(C1)∼Θ(C2)inΩ.
(2b)η(C1)∼η(C2)inΩ′.
(3) The following four conditions on (C1,C2)are equivalent:
(3a) The pair (C1,Θ(C2))is HBI in Ω.
(3b) The pair (Θ(C1),C2)is HBI in Ω.
(3c) The pair (Θ(C1),Θ(C2))is HBI in Ω.
(3d) The pair (η(C1),η(C2))is HBI in Ω′.
Let us give a proof of Theorem 3.1, by applying the lemma below:
Lemma 3.2. LetCbe a non-empty subset of ΩandC′a non-empty
subset of Ω′. We also ﬁx r≥0. Then the following equations hold:
η−1(Nr(C′)) =Nr(η−1(C′))inΩ. (3.1)
η(Nr(C)) =Nr(η(C))inΩ′, (3.2)
Θ(Nr(C))) =Nr(Θ(C)))inΩ. (3.3)
Proof of Lemma 3.2. The equations (3.1) and (3.2) comes immediately
from Conditions (1) and (2) on the map η: Ω→Ω′. The equality (3.3)
is obtained by the equations (3.1) and (3.2). /square
Proof of Theorem 3.1. First, the claim(1) comes immediately fromthe
equation(3.3) andtheobservationthat Θpreserves inclusions. Se cond,
theclaim(2)canbeobtainedbytheequations(3.1)and(3.2)inLemma
3.2. We shall prove the claim (3). The implications (3c) ⇒(3a) and
(3c)⇒(3b) are both trivial. Let us prove the implications (3a) ⇒(3c)
and (3b) ⇒(3c). Fix any r≥0. Then by Condition (2) on η, one canKOBAYASHI’S PROPERNESS CRITERION 13
easily see that the following two equations hold:
Θ(C1)∩Nr(Θ(C2)) = Θ(C1∩Nr(Θ(C2))),
Nr(Θ(C1))∩Θ(C2) = Θ(Nr(Θ(C1))∩C2).
Bothoftheimplications(3a) ⇒(3c)and(3b) ⇒(3c)comeimmediately
from the observation that for any bounded subset C0of Ω, the subset
Θ(C0) is also a bounded in Ω, and equations above. Finally, let us
prove the equivalence (3c) ⇔(3d). Fix r≥0. Then by Lemma 3.2,
we have:
η(C1)∩Nr(η(C2)) =η(C1)∩η(Nr(C2))
=η(Θ(C1))∩η(Θ(Nr(C2)))
=η(Θ(C1)∩Θ(Nr(C2)))
=η(Θ(C1)∩Nr(Θ(C2))).
Since Θ( C1)∩Nr(Θ(C2)) is a Θ-ﬁxed subset of Ω and ηis a proper
map, one can see that η(C1)∩Nr(η(C2)) is bounded in Ω′if and only if
Θ(C1)∩Nr(Θ(C2)) is bounded in Ω. This proves the equivalence (3c)
⇔(3d). /square
We shall put
P×(Ω)Θ:={C∈ P×(Ω)|Θ(C) =C},
[P×(Ω)Θ] :={[C]∈[P×(Ω)]|C∈ P×(Ω)Θ} ⊂[P×(Ω)].
Furthermore, for each non-empty subset Cof Ω, we also write
HBI(C: Ω)Θ:=HBI(C: Ω)∩P×(Ω)Θ⊂ HBI(C: Ω),
HBI([C] : Ω)Θ:=HBI([C] : Ω)∩[P×(Ω)Θ]⊂ HBI([C] : Ω).
Then, as a corollary to Theorem 3.1, we also obtain the following:
Corollary 3.3. Let us consider the bijective map
η∗:P×(Ω)Θ∼−→ P×(Ω′), C/maps⊔o→η(C).
(1) For each C∈ P×(Ω)Θ, the map η∗gives a one-to-one correspon-
dence between HBI(C: Ω)ΘandHBI(η(C) : Ω′).
(2) The bijection η∗:P×(Ω)Θ∼→ P×(Ω′)induces the bijective map
below
η−
∗: [P×(Ω)Θ]∼−→[P×(Ω′)],[C]/maps⊔o→[η(C)].
Furthermore, for each C∈ P×(Ω)Θ, the map η−
∗gives a one-to-one
correspondence between HBI([C] : Ω)ΘandHBI([η(C)] : Ω′).14 KENTO OGAWA, TAKAYUKI OKUDA
3.2.Spaces of orbits in proper metric spaces. Let (M,d) be a
proper metric space equipped with a continuous isometric action of a
compact group K. We denote by K\Mthe space of K-orbits in M
and by
̟:M→K\M, p/maps⊔o→K·p
the quotient map. Note that the space K\Mis locally-compact Haus-
dorﬀ with respect to the quotient topology, and the map ̟:M→
K\Mis proper. Then
dK:K\M×K\M→R≥0,
(O1,O2)/maps⊔o→min{d(x,y)|(x,y)∈ O1×O2}
is well-deﬁned and deﬁnes a proper metric on the space K\M. The
quotient topology on K\Mcoincides with the topology on K\Min-
duced by the metric dK.
One can easily check that the map ̟:M→K\Msatisﬁes Con-
ditions (1) and (2), and thus Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.3 can be
applied for (Ω ,Ω′,η) = (M,K\M,̟).
Furthermore, let Σ be a closed subset of Msatisfying the following
two conditions:
•For each K-orbitOinM, the intersection Σ ∩Ois non-empty.
•For each pair of K-orbits (O1,O2) inM, there exists ( p,q)∈
(Σ∩O1)×(Σ∩O2) such that d(p,q) =dK(O1,O2).
Let us consider Σ as a proper metric space with respect to the rest ric-
tion of the metric don Σ. Then the restriction
η:=̟|Σ: Σ→K\M, p/maps⊔o→K·p
is surjective and satisﬁes Conditions (1) and (2). Therefore, The orem
3.1 and Corollary 3.3 can be applied for (Ω ,Ω′,η) = (Σ,K\M,η).
Let us consider the situation that Mis a connected complete Rie-
mannian manifold and the K-action on Mis smooth and isometric in
the sense that the Riemannian metric tensor on Mis ﬁxed by K. A
connected, closed, regular smooth submanifold Σ of Mis called a sec-
tion for the K-action on Mif it meets all K-orbits in Morthogonally
(see [32] for the details). Furthermore, the K-action on Mis said to
be polar [resp. hyperpolar] if it admits a section [resp. ﬂat section].
A section Σ for the K-action on Msatisﬁes the two conditions above
(a proof can be found in [11, Proposition 1.3.2]), and thus even in the
situation above, Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.3 can be applied for
(Ω,Ω′,η) = (Σ,K\M,η). Note that for a section Σ for the K-action
onM, by deﬁning
NK(Σ) :={k∈K|k·Σ = Σ} ⊂K,
ZK(Σ) :={k∈K|k·p=pfor anyp∈Σ} ⊂NK(Σ),KOBAYASHI’S PROPERNESS CRITERION 15
we obtain the generalized Weyl group W:=NK(Σ)/ZK(Σ) acting on
the section Σ. It is known that the generalized Weyl group Wis ﬁnite
(in our setting), and for each p∈Σ,
(K·p)∩Σ =W·p
(see [32, Section 4] for the details). In particular, in this situation, we
have
Θ(C) :=η−1(Θ(C)) =W·C
for any non-empty subset Cof Σ.
4.Proofs of Theorems 2.8 and 2.9
The goal of this section is to give proofs of Theorems 2.8 and 2.9
stated in Section 2.4.
Let (M,d) be a proper metric space equipped with a continuous
proper isometric transitive action of a locally-compact group G. We
ﬁx a base point ∗ofM, and put
π:G→M, g/maps⊔o→g·∗.
Note that the map πis continuous proper and surjective. The compact
isotropy subgroup of Gat the point ∗is denoted by K.
We ﬁrst remark that, in the situation above, by Propositions 2.3, G
should be σ-compact.
Let us introduce the following notions: For a non-empty subset Hof
Gand a non-empty compact subset CofM, we deﬁne the non-empty
subsetSH(C) ofMby
SH(C) :=π−1(C)·π(H)
={g·π(h)|g∈π−1(C) andh∈H} ⊂M.
For the case where C={∗}, we just put
SH(∗) :=SH({∗}) =K·π(H) =K·H·∗ ⊂M.
4.1.Proper isometric transitive actions on metric spaces and
proper pairs. In this subsection, our goal is to show the following
theorem:
Theorem 4.1. LetH1andH2be both non-empty subsets of G.
(i)IfSH1(∗)∼SH2(∗)inM, thenH1∼H2inG.
(ii)Ifthe pair (H1,H2)isproper in G, then the pair (SH1(∗),SH2(∗))
is HBI in M.
To show Theorem 4.1, let us give a proof of the lemma below:
Lemma 4.2. LetHbe a non-empty subset of Gand ﬁxr≥0. We
putDr:=π−1(Nr(∗))⊂G. Then
π−1(Nr(SH(∗))) =K·H·Dr.16 KENTO OGAWA, TAKAYUKI OKUDA
Proof of Lemma 4.2. First, we show
π−1(Nr(SH(∗)))⊂K·H·Dr.
Take any g∈π−1(Nr(SH(∗))). Put p:=π(g)∈Nr(SH(∗)). One can
ﬁnd and do take q∈SH(∗) withd(p,q)≤r. SinceSH(∗) =K·H·∗,
one can also take k∈Kandh∈Hwithq=k·h·∗. Then
d(π(h−1·k−1·g),∗) =d(p,q)≤r.
Therefore, h−1·k−1·g∈Drand thus g∈K·H·Dr.
Conversely, let us prove
π−1(Nr(SH(∗)))⊃K·H·Dr.
Fix anyk∈K,h∈Handd∈Dr. We put p:=π(d)∈Nr(∗). Then
π(k·h·d) =k·h·pand
d(k·h·p,k·h·∗) =d(p,∗)≤r.
Sincek·h·∗ ∈SH(∗), we have that π(k·h·d)∈Nr(SH(∗)). /square
We give a proof of Theorem 4.1 as below:
Proof of Theorem 4.1. First, we shall prove theclaim(i). Suppose that
SH1(∗)⊂Nr(SH2(∗)) andSH2(∗)⊂Nr(SH1(∗))
forr≥0. PutDr:=π−1(Nr(∗)). Then Dris compact and D−1
r=
Dr⊃K. For (i,j) = (1,2) or (2,1), by Lemma 4.2, we have
Hi⊂K·Hi·K
=π−1(SHi(∗))
⊂π−1(Nr(SHj(∗)))
=K·Hj·Dr
⊂Dr·Hj·D−1
r.
This proves H1∼H2.
Next, let us prove the claim (ii). Assume that the pair ( H1,H2)
is proper in G. Let us ﬁx r≥0. By Proposition 2.6, we only need
to show that the subset SH1(∗)∩Nr(SH2(∗)) ofMis bounded. Put
Dr:=π−1(Nr(∗)). Then by Lemma 4.2, we have
π−1(SH1(∗)∩Nr(SH2(∗))) =π−1(SH1(∗))∩π−1(Nr(SH2(∗)))
= (K·H1·K)∩(K·H2·Dr).
SinceK·H1·K∈[H1],K·H2·Dr∈[H2] and ([H1],[H2]) is proper in
G, the intersection ( K·H1·K)∩(K·H2·Dr) is relatively compact in G.
ThusSH1(∗)∩Nr(SH2(∗)) is bounded in Msinceπis surjective. /squareKOBAYASHI’S PROPERNESS CRITERION 17
4.2.Proofs of Theorems 2.8 and 2.9. In this subsection, we give
proofs of Theorems 2.8 and 2.9. We suppose that our metric G-space
Mhas the property (S) stated in Section 1.
Then the following theorem, which claims the converse implications
of those in Theorem 4.1, holds:
Theorem 4.3. In the setting above, let H1andH2be both non-empty
subsets of G.
(i)H1∼H2inGif and only if SH1(∗)∼SH2(∗)inM.
(ii)Thepair (H1,H2)isproper in Gif andonlyifthe pair (SH1(∗),SH2(∗))
is HBI in M.
The following lemma plays a key role in our proof of Theorem 4.3.
Lemma 4.4. LetHbe a non-empty closed subset of G. Then for each
r≥0, there exists τ≥0such that
SH(Nr(∗))⊂Nτ(SH(∗)).
Proof of Lemma 4.4. Let us ﬁx τ=τ(r)≥0 as in Property (S). Take
anyq∈SH(Nr(∗)), and we shall prove q∈Nτ(SH(∗)). Fix g∈
π−1(Nr(∗)) andh∈Hwithq=g·π(h). We put p:=π(g)∈Nr(∗).
Then by the deﬁnition of τ, there exists g′∈Gsuch that g′·p=∗and
d(q,g′·q)≤τ. We put q0:=g′·q∈M. Since
/braceleftBigg
(g′)−1·∗=p=g·∗,
(g′)−1·q0=q=g·h·∗,
we obtain k:=g′g∈Kandq0=k·h·∗ ∈SH(∗). This proves that
q∈Nτ(SH(∗)). /square
Let us give a proof of Theorem 4.3 as below.
Proof of Theorem 4.3. First, we discuss the claim (i) in Theorem 4.3.
The “if”-part of the claim is just Theorem 4.1 (i). We show the “only
if”-part. Assume H1∼H2inGand we shall prove SH1(∗)∼SH2(∗)
inM. Fix a compact subset DofGwithH1⊂ND(H2) andH2⊂
ND(H1). We deﬁne the subset D′ofGbyD′:=D·K. SinceD−1and
D′are both compact, one can ﬁnd and do take r1,r2≥0 with
π(D−1)⊂Nr1(∗) andπ(D′)⊂Nr2(∗).18 KENTO OGAWA, TAKAYUKI OKUDA
Takeτ≥0 as in Lemma 4.4 for r=r2, and put r′:=r1+τ≥0. Then
for (i,j) = (1,2) or (2,1), we obtain
SHi(∗) =K·π(Hi)
⊂K·π(ND(Hj))
=K·π(D·Hj·D−1)
=D′·Hj·π(D−1)

=Nr1(SHj(Nr2(∗))) (∵the deﬁnition of SHj(Nr2(∗)))
⊂Nr1Nτ(SHj(∗)) (∵Lemma 4 .4)
⊂Nr′(SHj(∗)).
This proves SH1(∗)∼SH2(∗) inM.
Next, we shall give a proof of the claim (ii) in Theorem 4.3. The
“only if”-part of the claim is just Theorem 4.1 (ii). Let us prove the
“if”-part. Assume that the pair ( SH1(∗),SH2(∗)) is HBI in M. Take
anyH′
1∈[H1] and any H′
2∈[H2]. We shall prove that the intersection
H′
1∩H′
2is relatively compact in G. Sinceπ:G→Mis a continuous
proper surjective map and ( M,d) is a proper metric space, we only
need to show that the image π(H′
1∩H′
2) is bounded in M. Since
π(H′
1∩H′
2)⊂π(H′
1)∩π(H′
2)
⊂(K·π(H′
1))∩(K·π(H′

1(∗)∩SH′
2(∗),
it is enough to show that the intersection SH′
1(∗)∩SH′
2(∗) is bounded
inM. Recall that the claim (i) in Theorem 4.3 has been proved above.
Thus, we have SH′
i(∗)∈[SHi(∗)] fori= 1,2. Therefore, by the as-
sumption, the intersection SH′
1(∗)∩SH′
2(∗) is bounded in M./square
As in Section 3.2, we consider the proper metric space ( K\M,dK),
the quotient map

Note that, as we mentioned in Section 3.2, Theorem 3.1 and Corollary
3.3 can be applied for ̟:M→K\M.
To prove Theorem 2.8, it is enough to show the following theorem:
Theorem 4.5. In the setting above, let H1andH2be both non-empty
subsets of G.KOBAYASHI’S PROPERNESS CRITERION 19

(1iii) The pair (π(H1),SH2(∗))is HBI in M.

(2vi)HBI(µ(H1) :K\M) =HBI(µ(H2) :K\M).

lences:

(2iii)/d107/d115 /d43/d51(2vi)
First, both of the equivalences (2ii) ⇔(2v) and (2iii) ⇔(2vi) come
from Proposition 2.7. Furthermore, the equivalence (2i) ⇔(2iv) is
followed by Proposition 2.3. Next, the equivalence (2ii) ⇔(2iii) can
be proved by applying Theorem 3.1 (2) for
(Ω,Ω′,η,C1,C2) = (M,K\M,̟,π(H1),π(H2))
sinceµ(H) =̟(SH(∗)) for each non-empty subset HofG. By the
similar arguments, the equivalences among the conditions (1ii), (1iii) ,
(1iv) and (1v) are followed by Theorem 3.1 (3). Both of the equiv-
alences (1i) ⇔(1ii) and (2ii) ⇔(2i) are already proved as Theorem

Let us consider the setting in Theorem 2.9. Note that as we men-
tioned in Section 3.2, Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.3 can be applied to

5.CAT(0) spaces and Property (S)
LetGbe a group and Ma proper metric space equipped with an
isometric transitive G-action. In this section, in terms of geometry on
CAT(0) spaces, we give a suﬃcient condition for property (S), sta ted
in Section 1, of the metric G-spaceM(see Theorem 5.2 and Corollary
5.4).
5.1.Notations for CAT(0) spaces. In this subsection, following [7]
and [9], we ﬁx our terminologies for CAT(0) spaces.
Let (Ω,d) be a metric space. For −∞< a < b < ∞, an isometric
mapc: [a,b]→Mis called a geodesic segment joining the points c(a)
andc(b) in Ω. A metric space (Ω ,d) is said to be a geodesic metric
space if any two points of Ω can be joined by a geodesic segment in Ω.
Let (Ω,d) be a geodesic metric space. For each triple ( x1,x2,x3)∈
Ω×Ω×Ω, a triple ( x′
1,x′
2,x′
3)∈R2×R2×R2is called a Euclidean
comparison triangle for ( x1,x2,x3) ifd(xi,xj) =dR2(x′
i,x′
j) for any
i,j= 1,2,3, where dR2denotes the standard metric on the Euclidean
planeR2. Note that for any triple ( x1,x2,x3) of points in Ω, a Eu-
clidean comparison triangle for ( x1,x2,x3) inR2exists uniquely up to
congruence. A geodesic metric space (Ω ,d) is called CAT(0) if for any
triple (x1,x2,x3)∈Ω×Ω×Ω, any point pon any geodesic segment
joiningx2andx3, and any Euclidean comparison triangle ( x′
1,x′
2,x′
3)
for (x1,x2,x3), the inequality below holds:
d(x1,p)≤dR2(x′
1,p′)
wherep′denotes the unique point in R2withdR2(x′
2,p′) =d(x2,p) and
dR2(x′
3,p′) =d(x3,p).
Recall that a metric space (Ω ,d) is called
•metrically-complete if any Cauchy sequence of points in Ω has
a limit in Ω, and
•geodesically-complete if any geodesic segment can be extended
to a geodesic line R→Ω.
For a locally-compact CAT(0) space (Ω ,d), the followings are known
(see [9]):
•(Ω,d) is proper as a metric space if and only if it is metrically-
complete,
•(Ω,d) is geodesically-complete, then it is proper.KOBAYASHI’S PROPERNESS CRITERION 21
•(Ω,d) is homeomorphic to a ﬁnite dimensional manifold, then
it is geodesically-complete (see [7, Proposition 5.1.2 in Chapter
II]).
Wealsointroducetheboundary ∂Ωatinﬁnityof(Ω ,d)inthesenseof
[7, Chapter II.8]. An isometric map c: [0,∞)→Ω is called a geodesic
ray issuing from a point c(0)∈Ω. Two geodesic rays c,c′: [0,∞)→Ω
are said to be asymptotic, or equivalent, if there exists a constant a≥0
such that d(c(t),c′(t))≤afor anyt∈[0,∞). The set of all equivalent
classes of geodesic rays is denoted by ∂Ω. The equivalent class of a
geodesic ray cis written as c(∞)∈∂Ω. Note that each isometry γ
on Ω causes a natural permutation on the set ∂Ω. In particular, each
isometric action on Ω by a group Gcan be extended to a G-action on
the set Ω−:= Ω⊔∂Ω.
Remark 5.1. The boundary ∂Ωand the union Ω−:= Ω⊔∂Ωadmit
some important topologies and metrics. For example, if (Ω,d)is a
proper CAT(0) space and we consider the cone topology on Ω−:= Ω⊔
∂Ω, thenΩ−gives a compactiﬁcation of Ω. See[7, Chapter II] for the
details.
5.2.A suﬃcient condition for Property (S) of metric homo-
geneous G-spaces. Let (Ω,d) be a proper (and thus, metrically-
complete) CAT(0) space equipped with an isometric action of a group
G, andMa closedG-orbit of Ω. Note that Mitself is a proper metric
space with respect to the restriction of donM.
For each ξ∈∂Ω, we denote by Pξthe isotropy subgroup of Gatξ,
that is,
Pξ:={g∈G|g·ξ=ξ} ⊂G.
The following proposition gives a suﬃcient condition for Property
(S) of such a metric G-spaceM:
Theorem 5.2. In the setting above, we assume thatthe followingholds:
one can choose a constant b≥0such that for any p,q∈M, there exists
a geodesic ray cinΩissuing from psuch that
d(q,c) := min
t∈[0,∞)d(q,c(t))≤b
and the Pc(∞)-action on Mis transitive. Then the G-spaceMhas
Property (S).
We give a proof of Theorem 5.2 by applying the following lemma:
Lemma 5.3 ([7, Proposition 8.2 and its proof in Chapter II.8]) .Let
us ﬁx any p,p′∈Ωand any geodesic ray cinΩissuing from p. Then
there uniquely exists a geodesic ray c′inΩissuing from p′asymptotic
toc. Furthermore, for any t∈[0,∞),
d(c(t),c′(t))≤d(p,p′).22 KENTO OGAWA, TAKAYUKI OKUDA
Proof of Theorem 5.2. Takeb≥0 as inthe assumption. Fixany r≥0.
We putτ(r) :=r+2b. Take any p0,p,q∈Mwithd(p,p0)≤r. Our
goal is to prove that there exists g∈Gsuch that g·p=p0and
d(q,g·q)≤τ(r) =r+2b. By the assumption, one can ﬁnd and do take
a geodesic ray cin Ω issuing from psuch that d(q,c)≤band thePc(∞)-
action on Mis transitive. Let us ﬁx t0∈[0,∞) withd(q,c(t0))≤b
andg∈Pc(∞)such that g·p=p0. Putq0:=g·q∈M. We only need
to show that d(q,q0)≤r+ 2b. Let us consider the geodesic ray g·c
issuing from p0in Ω deﬁned by
g·c: [0,∞)→Ω, t/maps⊔o→g·c(t).
Sinceg∈Pc(∞), we have that g·cis asymptotic to c. Thus, by Lemma
5.3,
d(c(t0),(g·c)(t0))≤d(p,p0)≤r.
We note that
d((g·c)(t0),q0) =d(c(t0),q)≤b.
Therefore, we obtain
d(q,q0)≤d(q,c(t0))+d(c(t0),(g·c)(t0))+d((g·c)(t0),q0)
≤r+2b.
This completes the proof. /square
We also obtain the following corollary:
Corollary 5.4. LetMbe a geodesically-completeCAT(0)spaceequipped
with an isometric transitive action of a group G. Assume that for each
ξ∈∂M, the isotropy subgroup PξofGatξacts onMtransitively.
Then the metric G-spaceMhas Property (S).
Remark 5.5. It should be remarked that Caprace–Monod [10, Theorem
1.3]proved that for a geodesically-complete CAT(0) space Mequipped
with an isometric action of a group G, if the isotropy group Pξacts
cocompactly on Mfor anyξ∈∂M, thenMis isometric to a product
of symmetric spaces, Euclidean buildings and Bass–Serre tr ees.
6.Kobayashi’s properness criterion from Theorem 2.9
In this section, let us argue that Kobayashi’s properness criterion
(Theorem 2.5) can be explained by applying Theorem 2.9 to isometric
actions of real linear reductive Lie groups on non-compact Riemann ian
symmetric spaces.
LetGbe a real linear reductive Lie group. We ﬁx a realization of G
as a transpose-stable closed subgroup of GL(N,R) with ﬁnitely many
connected components ( N∈Z≥0). The Cartan involution θonGis
deﬁned by θ(g) :=t(g−1) forg∈G, wheretAdenotes the transpose of
the matrix A. Then the θ-ﬁxed point subgroup K=G∩O(n) ofGis a
maximal compact subgroup of G. The Lie algebra of Gis denoted by gKOBAYASHI’S PROPERNESS CRITERION 23
and we write g=k+pfor the Cartan decomposition of gwith respect
to the Cartan involution θ. Note that by the adjoint representation,
which will be denoted by Ad : G→GL(g), the group Kacts onp.
We write M:=G/Kfor the homogeneous manifold of ( G,K) with
the base point ∗:=eK∈M=G/K, whereeis the unit of G. The
quotient map from GtoM=G/Kis denoted by π:G→M. As is
well-known that the tangent space T∗MofMat the point ∗can be
identiﬁed with pcanonically. Let us ﬁx a K-invariant inner-product on
p. Then such the inner-product deﬁnes a G-invariant Riemannian met-
ric onM. Then it is well-known that Mequipped with such the metric
is a simply-connected Riemannian globally symmetric space without
compact factors (see [13, Chapter V] for the details), In particu lar,M
has a direct product decomposition
M=M0×M−
whereM0is a Euclidean space and M−is a Riemannian globally sym-
metric space of non-compact type. Note that for any parallel shif t
ton the Euclidean space M0and any h∈Isom0(M−), one can ﬁnd
g∈Gsuch that gdeﬁnes the isometry ( t,h) onM=M0×M−, where
Isom0(M−) denotes the identity component of the full isometry group
ofM−.
SinceM0andM−arebothgeodesically-complete CAT(0) spaces (see
[9]), ourM=M0×M−is also a geodesically-complete CAT(0) space.
Let us denote by ∂M=∂M0×∂M−the boundary at inﬁnity of M
(see Section 5.1 for the deﬁnition of ∂M). Then for each ξ= (ξ0,ξ−)∈
∂M=∂M0×∂M−, the ﬁxed point subgroup Pξ:={g∈G|g·ξ=ξ}
acts onMtransitively. In fact, on the Euclidean space M0, the group
of parallel shifts acts transitively on M0and ﬁxes the boundary ∂M0
pointwisely, andon M−,theﬁxedpointsubgroupat ξ−oftheconnected
linearsemisimpleLiegroupIsom 0(M−)isaparabolicsubgroupandacts
onM−transitively (See [6, §I.1 and I.2] for the details). Therefore, by
Corollary 5.4, our G-spaceMhas Property (S).
In addition, let us choose a maximal abelian subspace aofp, and
consider the inner-product on ainduced by the ﬁxed inner-product on
p.
We deﬁne the ﬁnite group Wby
NK(a) :={k∈K|Ad(k)a=a} ⊂K,
ZK(a) :={k∈K|Ad(k)X=Xfor eachX∈a} ⊂NK(a),
W:=NK(a)/ZK(a).
ThenWcan be considered as a ﬁnite subgroup of the orthogonal group
O(a) on the inner-product space a. Note that if Gis contained in a
connectedcomplexLiegroup GC, thentheﬁnitegroup Wdeﬁnedabove
coincides with the Weyl group of the restricted root system for ( g,a).24 KENTO OGAWA, TAKAYUKI OKUDA
We deﬁne A:= exp(a)⊂Gand consider the connected, closed,
totally-geodesic ﬂat submanifold π(A) =A· ∗ofM. Note that the
bijective map
ι:a→π(A), X/maps⊔o→exp(X)·∗
isisometric, andthustheﬁnitegroup Walsoactson π(A)isometrically.
It is well-known (see [34, Example 2.1 (iv)]) that π(A) is a section in
the sense ofthe last part ofSection 3.2, andthe generalized Weyl g roup
coincides with the ﬁnite group Wdeﬁned above.
Therefore, Theorem 2.5 can be obtained by applying Theorem 2.9
to the section Σ = π(A)∼=a. Note that for pairs of non-empty subsets
(C1,C2) ofa,C1∼C2as in a locally-compact additive group aif and
only ifC1∼C2as in a proper metric space a. Therefore, ( C1,C2) is
proper in the group aif and only if ( C1,C2) is HBI in the proper metric
spacea.
