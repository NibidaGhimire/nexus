Is thermodynamics consistent with the quantum gravity reco nciliation hypothesis [A. G. Cohen
et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4971 (1999)], which establishes h olographic dark energy models?
Here, we have attempted to address this issue in the aﬃrmativ e by concentrating on the ﬁrst law
of thermodynamics.
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the most challenging issues in the standard
model of cosmology is the origin of dark energy (DE). Of
allthe hypothesesgiventorepresentthe universe’sevolu-
tion, the standard method, which includes the ordinary
Friedmann equations produced by solving the Einstein
ﬁeld equations with a constant termed the cosmological
constant (CC), is the most useful. The choice of CC is
due to its simplicity and general relativity’s (GR) com-
patibility with other areas of physics, such as particle
physics, thermodynamics, and observations. Despite sig-
niﬁcant advancements in modern physics, the nature of
CC remainsunsolved. Another contentious subject is the
connection between quantum physicsand gravity. It may
be solvedafter we discoverthe ultimate theory ofgravity,
or it may help us ﬁnd out the promised theory of gravity.
In order to solve this paradigm and reconcile quantum
mechanics and gravity, Cohen et al. [1] proposed
ρΛ<S
2L4, (1)
whereρΛdenotes the vacuum energy density [1–5]. In-
deed, this bound is also obtained by conditioning that
the vacuum energy ( EΛ≈ρΛL3), stored in volume L3,
should not exceed the energy of the same size black hole
(E≈L) i.e. [1, 6]
EΛ< E. (2)
In the framework of GR, where we have S=A
4∼L2
(the Bekenstein entropy-area relation) and E=L/2 for
the Misner–Sharp energy of a black hole, one can easily
see that both inequalities ( 1) and (2) lead to ρΛ< L−2.
On the other hand, in dynamic situations, it appears
that the apparent horizon is a proper casual boundary of
the universe [7–12]. Motivated by these statements and
supposing that a black hole of the same size as the cos-
mos also satisﬁes the Bekenstein entropy, it is proposed
∗h.moradpour@riaam.ac.ir
†shahram.jalalzadeh@ufpe.br
‡sharma.umesh@gla.ac.inthat the vacuum energy stored in the universe, bounded
by the apparent horizon, may form a model for DE. Here
is where the Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) ﬁrst man-
ifested itself, based on introducing ρΛ=C2S
L4as DE,
[2–5]. It should be emphasized that Cohen’s approach
only assumes that the universe would collapse into itself
if its radius equals its Schwarzchild radius; it does not
state that the entropy of the black hole and the universe
are equivalent because their contents and structures dif-
fer.
Due to the shortcomings of primary HDE (PHDE) [5],
various modiﬁcations have subsequently been introduced
and classiﬁed into three classes, including i) corrections
totheBekensteinentropyduetovariouseﬀectslikequan-
tum considerations, ii) other boundaries like particle
horizon, iii) interactions between various sectors of cos-
mic ﬂuid, iv) the nature of the proportionality coeﬃcient
C2(constant or variable) [13], and v) alternative options
forthe Bekensteinentropyobtained by usingthe general-
izedstatisticssuchasTsallisHDE(THDE)[14], Sharma–
Mittal HDE (SMHDE) [15], Kaniadakis and new Tsallis
HDE models (KHDE and NTHDE, respectively) [16–18].
Paralleltothedeepconnectionbetweenthermodynam-
ics and gravity [19–21], it is also shown that the Fried-
mann equation can be rewritten as the ﬁrst law of ther-
modynamics. Although in the dynamic situation two
temperatures are proposed for the horizon, called the
Hayward–Kodama temperature [7–9] and the Cai–Kim
temperature [10, 12], both of them satisfy the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamicsonthe apparenthorizonandrespect the
Friedmann equation [7–10, 12, 23, 24]. Consequently, on
the one hand, the Bekenstein entropy bound is respected
by the quantum ﬁeld theory [25], and on the other hand,
the revealed deep connection between thermodynamics
and gravity [19–21] conﬁrms a preliminary expectation,
i.e., the true physical statementsand lawsshould conﬁrm
each other.
As a result, because vacuum energy is an essential el-
ement of the cosmos, the question of whether Cohen et
al.’s idea actually meets the principles of thermodynam-
ics emerges. Indeed, the physical statements must con-
cur, which means that a suggestion like that of Cohen et
al. must be consistent with thermodynamic laws. The
investigation of the existence and degree of this compat-2
ibility is the foundation of this study.
Our primary purpose here is to establish a link be-
tween thermodynamics and the idea of Ref. [1]. We will
ﬁrst describe related earlier studies in the next section
to accomplish this goal. The third section will investi-
gate the compatibility of bound ( 1) with the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics. The ﬁnal part contains a summary.
II. THERMODYNAMICS INSPIRES
HOLOGRAPHIC BOUNDS
In the framework of thermodynamics, one may justify
Eq. (1) as:
•Total energy of quantum ﬁelds in a vacuum is esti-
mated as EΛ∼ρΛV, in which Vdenotes the cos-
mos volume [26, 27].
•This energy should be smaller than the energy of
the same size black hole ( E), as it has not turned
into a black hole.
•Bearing the Euler relation, ( E=TS), [28] in mind
and accepting T∼1
Las the temperature of the
same size black hole, the energy of the black hole
with entropy Smay be estimated as E=TS∼S
L.
•Finally, since V∼L3, by combining the above
steps, one can easily reach ρΛ<S
L4. Conse-
quently, in this manner, one does not need to as-
sumeS∼L2(1), and the result is proposed for all
functions of S(L).
Regarding the above justiﬁcation, it is concluded that
the RHS of Eq. ( 1) is based on the Euler relation, which
is not a law: The Euler relation is a crucial statement in
classical thermodynamics that expresses internal energy
as the sum of the products of canonical pairs of extended
and intense variables. The name “Euler relation” refers
to the fact that this relationship is obtained using Eu-
ler’s homogeneous function theorem. Subsequently and
motivated by attempts like [19–21], one may arrange to
use the Clausius relation, dE=TdS, which is a form of
the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics and should be valid on
casual boundaries [28]. Therefore, as a step forward to
relate holographic bound to thermodynamics, it may be
argued that a proper holographic bound should satisfy
thedE=TdSrelation instead of the Euler equation.
This assertion motivates us to consider the vacuum en-
ergy stored in diﬀerential volume, dV. Relying on the
proposal of Cohen et al., its energy should be smaller
than the same size black hole. This leads us to consider
[29]
ρΛ<dE
dV⇒ρΛ< TdS
dV∼dS
dA
L2, (3)
wheredE=TdSis assumed. Moreover, the thermody-
namic justiﬁcation of Eq. ( 1) as well as T∼1
L(tem-
perature of the same size black hole) [1] has also beenadopted. It means that Eq. ( 3) may be considered as
a thermodynamic inspiration of Eq.( 1). It is also easy
to see that the use of Eq. ( 3) generates the outcome of
Eq. (1) forS=SB.
Using (3) and the R´ enyientropy, alsomotivated by the
probable quantum aspects of gravity [30], R´ enyi HDE
(RHDE) has recently been introduced in [29]. In this
model, there are two entropies: 1) the FRW universe’s
boundary entropy (horizon entropy) and 2) the entropy
ofablackhole(the same-sizeblackhole)usedtoscalethe
vacuum energy. Apart from the limitations of this argu-
ment[32], thisisanattempttoproposeathermodynamic
approach to reconcile quantum and gravity, resulting in
an HDE model with appropriate behavior (see Ref. [29]
and its citations).
Because of the anonymous nature of DE, article [24]
claims that we should not rule out the probability of en-
tropy creation via DE. Thus, while the Friedmann equa-
tioniscorrect,the totalentropymaydivergefromBeken-
stein entropy due to the presence of DE and its interac-
tion with the environment. In this manner, starting from
the ﬁrst Friedmann equation [24]
H2+κ
a2=8π
3ρ, (4)
accepting the energy deﬁnition dE=ρdV, (where ρ=
ρ1+ρDin which ρDandρ1denote the energy densities of
DEandtheremainingpartsofcosmicﬂuid, respectively),
and using the ﬁrst law, one can ﬁnd
SA=SB+1
6/integraldisplay
A2dρD, (5)
wheneverthereisnotanymutualinteractionbetweenDE
and other parts of cosmic ﬂuid [24]. Here, SBrepresents
Bekenstein entropy (A
4), andSAis the total entropy. If
the DE nature is identical to ρ1, then one reaches SA=
SB[24]. If one uses Tsallis entropy [33], or fractional–
fractal entropy [34, 35], and Eq. ( 5), then the obtained
DE seems to be able to justify DE [24]. Indeed, Eq. ( 5)
says that while the Universe dynamics is governed by
the Friedmann equations, DE, and its interaction with
other parts of the cosmos may produce entropy. In this
manner, one can ﬁnd ρD(SA) by ﬁnding SA(ρD). In the
presence of interaction ( Q), one obtains [23]
SA=SB+1

More related studies can also be found in [36–40]. As a
side note, if one does not decompose ρtoρ1andρD, then
the ordinary solution [23, 24]
ρ=−6/integraldisplayS′

is obtained by employing the ﬁrst law of thermody-
namics on the cosmos boundary surface, and using the
energy-momentum conservation law. Here, SAdenotes3

Eq. (1) by hiring SBin calculating Eq. ( 7).
For a non-interacting cosmic ﬂuids, using Eq. ( 5), one
ﬁnds
ρD= 6/integraldisplaydSA

Now, as an example, let us consider [41]
SA=SB+αAµ, (9)
whereαandµare unknown coeﬃcients. Utilizing
Eq. (8), we obtain
ρD=BL2µ−4, (10)
whereB= (4π)µ−26αµ
µ−2andA= 4πL2, in which Lde-
notes the radius of the boundary, is used to obtain this
result. Mathematically, it is THDE obtained by employ-
ingEq.(1), andTsallis[14] (orfractional–fractal[34, 35])
entropy.
In Ref. [32], authors urge modifying PHDE (the pro-
posal (1)) as
ρΛ∝6/integraldisplaydS
A2−3
2A, (11)
which is obviously compatible with Eq. ( 8). While SA
represents the total entropy of the cosmic boundary ( SB
plus the entropy amount produced by DE) [24], S(in
Eq. (11)) is the entropy of the same size black hole (the
same size as the cosmos). Therefore, one may deduce
that if the entropy of the same-size black hole is equal
to the sum of the Bekenstein entropy and the entropy
produced by DE, then Eq. ( 11) should reduce to Eq. ( 8).
Consequently, if vacuum energy is involved in DE, then
a preliminary cautious estimation can be ρΛ∝ρD(take
into account that i)SA∝negationslash=S,ii) this probability that
all of the vacuum energy, stored in the cosmos, may not
have a role in the current accelerated phase of the uni-
verse, and iii) DE is not entirely made up of vacuum
energy). Accepting ρΛ∝ρD, one can start from Eq. ( 8)
to reach Eq. ( 11). Hence, we may accept Eq. ( 8) as the
thermodynamic motivation of bound ( 11).
III. THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
Prior to moving on, it’s essential to keep in mind a few
things.
•We always have a constant of integration at the
last step due to integration in Eqs. ( 8) and (11)
(and comparable relations). We usually disregard
the integration constant [32], although its existence
occasionallyenhancesthe model[42]. Issuesinvolv-
ing such constants are well-known, such as the CC
problem.•The bound ( 3) is in a diﬀerential form which means
it does not include the constant of integration,
which is an advantage over ( 8).
•It is assumed in the proposed thermodynamic ex-
planation of Eq. ( 1) thatT∼1/L. It contradicts
the standard eﬀective ﬁeld theory [1] as well as
gravitational theories in which the temperature of
a black hole is proportional to its surface gravity
[43].
•Whereas Eq. ( 1) thermodynamic’s reasoning is
based on the Euler equation, the Clausius relation
provides the foundation of Eq. ( 3). Nevertheless,
the ﬁrst law’s involvement in Eq. ( 1) is unclear be-
cause the Clausius relation contains only some in-
formation encoded in the ﬁrst law [28]. The grav-
itational ﬁeld equations satisfy this fundamental
law, and any physical formulation is assumed to
be compatible with it.
•The pressure of the same-size black hole is ignored
in all of the alternatives considered. Moreover, the
GR ﬁeld equations on a black hole’s horizon take
the form of the ﬁrst statement ( dE=TdS−PdV
is fulﬁlled) [19–21], implying that the contribution
of the pressure of a black hole of the same size to
its energy content should also be included.
The ﬁrst law ( dE=TdS−PdV) is more basic than
the Euler equation ( E=TS−PV≡R), as previously
stated. To address the diﬃculties raised, we suggest us-
ing thedE=TdS−PdVversion of the ﬁrst law to
compute the energy of the same size black hole, which is
an extension of Eq. ( 3), which does not contain the PdV
component. The question here is what happens to the
additional terms in the diﬀerential of the Euler equation
when comparedtothe ﬁrstlaw. Mathematically, wehave
dR=TdS−PdV/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
the ﬁrst law =dE+SdT−VdP, (12)
while the Gibbs-Duhem equation ( S=VdP
dT) conditions
SdT−VdP= 0leadingto dR=dE[28],meaningthereis
noneedtoworryaboutthe extraterms[28]. Thevacuum
energy stored in the volume dVis equal to dEΛ=ρΛdV,
and as it has not turned into a black hole, we should
havedEΛ< dE=dR, wheredEis the energy of the
same size black hole. It is nothing but the proposal ( 2)
in volume dVand covers the original bound EΛ< R(2)
sincedR=dE. Consequently, we have
dEΛ
dV<dE
dV⇒ρΛ<dE
dV=TdS
dV−P,(13)
It is worth noting that this ﬁnding is not limited to
the Schwarzschild characteristics of energy and entropy.
Moreover, it states that the entropy, pressure, and tem-
perature of a black hole of the same size should be es-
timated thermodynamically, and hence the ﬁndings may
change under diﬀerent gravitational theories.4
GR and Bekenstein entropy
Consider the static spherically symmetric spacetime,
whose horizon located at radius r=L. The line element
is given by
ds2=−f(r)dt2+dr2
f(r)+r2dΩ2.(14)
IntheframeworkofGR, wherehorizonentropyobeysthe
Bekenstein entropyand we have P=1
8πr2[rf′(r)−1]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
r=L
for the black hole pressure on the horizon [43], Eq. ( 13)
leads to
ρΛ<1
2A⇒ρΛ< L−2, (15)
as the thermodynamic bound on the vacuum energy.
Here,T=f′(r)
4π(the Hawking temperature of horizon)
has been used. In the GR framework, both Eqs. ( 1)
and (15) claim that ρΛis scaled as L−2. Therefore, the
proposal of Cohen et al. is compatible with the ﬁrst law.
IV. CONCLUSION
Physical theories and logic must be compatible with
one another. Consequently, thermodynamic predictions,
for instance, should match those of large quantum sys-
tems. In the context of the quantum gravity reconcilia-
tion hypothesis, it is noteworthy to discuss the S∝Anrelation for the horizon entropy derived by working in
the context of Tsallis statistics [33] or addressing quan-
tum gravity concerns [34, 35, 44–46]. This suggests that
two distinct driving forces produce the same predictions,
implying that non-extensivity and quantum aspects of
gravity might be connected [30, 31]. Motivated by i)
the above expectation, ii) the the deep connection be-
tween thermodynamics and gravity, and iii) some recent
attempts to propose HDE models by relying on the pro-
posal of Cohen et al. and using the dE=TdSform of
the ﬁrst law [24, 29, 32], it is tried to ﬁnd out the re-
lationship between thermodynamic laws and holographic
bound introduced in [1]. In particular, we concluded that
the proposal of Cohen et al. is consistent with the ﬁrst
law if the pressure contribution is taken into account.
