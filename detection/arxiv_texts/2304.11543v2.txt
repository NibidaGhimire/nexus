ABSTRACT
Coarsening of two-phase systems is crucial for the stability of dense particle packings such as
alloys, foams, emulsions or supersaturated solutions. Mean field theories predict an asymptotic
scaling state with a broad particle size distribution. Aqueous foams are good model systems for
investigations of coarsening-induced structures, because the continuous liquid as well as the dispersed
gas phases are uniform and isotropic. We present coarsening experiments on wet foams, with liquid
fractions up to their unjamming point and beyond, that are performed under microgravity to avoid
gravitational drainage. As time elapses, a self-similar regime is reached where the normalized bubble
size distribution is invariant. Unexpectedly, the distribution features an excess of small roaming
bubbles, mobile within the network of jammed larger bubbles. These roaming bubbles are reminiscent
of rattlers in granular materials (grains not subjected to contact forces). We identify a critical liquid
fraction ϕ∗, above which the bubble assembly unjams and the two bubble populations merge into
a single narrow distribution of bubbly liquids. Unexpectedly, ϕ∗is larger than the random close
packing fraction of the foam ϕrcp. This is because, between ϕrcpandϕ∗, the large bubbles remain
connected due to a weak adhesion between bubbles. We present models that identify the physical
mechanisms explaining our observations. We propose a new comprehensive view of the coarsening
phenomenon in wet foams. Our results should be applicable to other phase-separating systems and
they may also help to control the elaboration of solid foams with hierarchical structures.

Significancy Statement
Coarsening is a ubiquitous phenomenon in phase separations. It is widely observed in alloys, polymers, emulsions,
foams and even in biological systems. However, coarsening of materials where the two phases have comparable
volume fractions is still poorly understood. To fill this gap, we performed coarsening experiments on aqueous foams in
microgravity – free from gravity-driven destabilization. We discovered that coarsening naturally produces, besides large
jammed bubbles, a significant proportion of small roaming bubbles. This hierarchical size distribution is surprising,
but could be general and exist in other coarsening systems. Foaming being a generic method to produce solid cellular
materials with many applications, making use of these roaming bubbles opens up a new way of designing hierarchical
materials.arXiv:2304.11543v2  [cond-mat.soft]  31 Jul 2023Hierarchical bubble size distribution in coarsening wet liquid foams A P REPRINT
1 Introduction
Liquid phase separation is a common phenomenon in material processing or aging. In the late stages of separation,
the dispersed domains grow, in order to decrease interfacial energy. This often occurs as the dispersed phase diffuses
through the continuous phase. This process, known as coarsening or Ostwald ripening, is sometimes referred to as
‘thermodynamic capitalism’ [58], where big entities get bigger at the expense of small entities which disappear.
Coarsening kinetics determines the microstructure of the materials, i.e. the average domain size and size distribution,
which is why it has been studied in widely varying contexts. The coarsening of alloys has been extensively studied
[56], but coarsening also affects crystallization of proteins [ 40], separation by chirality [ 42], synthesis of small particles
of controlled microstructure including quantum dots [ 2,20,47], stability of foams and emulsions [ 59,6,31] as well as
other complex liquid-liquid phase separations [ 46]. Coarsening has recently emerged as an important route to protein
compartmentalization within living cells [21].
The theoretical description of coarsening goes back to Lifshitz and Slyozov [ 33], and to Wagner [ 57], and is usually
referred to as ‘LSW theory’. This theory is only valid in the limit of high volume fraction ϕof the continuous
phase. Nonetheless, the LSW theory correctly predicts the coarsening behavior in numerous systems, namely, that
the time-dependent average domain radius increases with time as t1/3and that the normalized size distribution of the
domains (PDF) is invariant with time. Many efforts were subsequently made to account for the behavior at smaller ϕby
means of theoretical methods and by computer simulations [ 3,60]. However, the evolution of the growth regime in
t1/3toward the so called ’grain growth regime’ in t1/2established for vanishing ϕremains mostly unexplored, both
experimentally and theoretically. In view of the large variety of phase separating systems and their existing and potential
applications, improving the knowledge on this transition is highly desirable. We have chosen liquid foams as model
systems because the domains are fluid and isotropic.
Liquid foams are metastable dispersions of gas bubbles in a liquid matrix [ 59,6,31,18]. They are not only interesting
model systems for coarsening studies, they have numerous practical applications. Solidifying the continuous phase
of liquid foams yields solid materials which inherit the structure of their precursors. Solid foams are widely used for
packaging, insulation or as lightweight construction materials such as foamed cement or metallic foams. Their solid
volume fraction is frequently chosen between 20% and50%, to confer sufficient mechanical strength [ 18]. The solid
foam microstructure has an impact on its mechanical properties, for a given density. Hierarchical foam structures were
predicted to have an order of magnitude improvement of mechanical strength-to-density ratio with just two levels of
hierarchy [ 28]. Therefore, such hierarchical structures self-assembled by foam coarsening, as we report here, could be
of great interest for applications.
When the liquid volume fraction ϕis large, the bubbles are spherical and isolated, the dispersions are called ‘bubbly
liquids’ rather than foams. Coarsening is expected to lead to a bubble growth proportional to t1/3, as in Ostwald
ripening. When the liquid fraction ϕis decreased below a critical value, ϕrcp, contacts between neighboring bubbles
are formed and their shapes progressively evolve from spheres to polyhedra in the limit ϕ→0[6]. Equilibrium films
separating neighboring bubbles have generally thicknesses of a few tens of nanometers. They are connected three
by three to channels called Plateau borders , themselves connected at vertices . For disordered monodisperse foams,
ϕrcp≈36%, and ϕrcpis expected to decrease slightly as polydispersity increases [ 14]. Experiments with 3D foams of
small liquid fractions have shown that the average bubble radius grows at long times as t1/2[11,30,23,8], in contrast
with the t1/3scaling observed in the case of Ostwald ripening. The value of the exponent is related to the mechanism
of gas transfer between bubbles. In dry foams, it occurs mostly through the thin films between bubbles, whereas in
bubbly liquids, gas is transferred through bulk liquid [ 39]. Another important feature of coarsening is the shape of
the bubble size distribution that is also expected to change with liquid fraction. Several experimental and numerical
works [ 16,29,35,30,54,61] show that the normalized distribution is asymmetric, of the Weibull or lognormal type, in
the regime associated with the t1/2growth law, whereas for the t1/3regime, it is more symmetric and narrower [33].
Foams evolve with time not only because of coarsening but also due to gravity drainage [ 50,6], and possibly due to
rupture of liquid films separating neighboring bubbles, called coalescence. Since gravity drainage and coarsening are
coupled, studying and modelling coarsening requires gravity drainage to be suppressed. Pioneering foam coarsening
experiments were performed with dry horizontal 2D foams (single layers of bubbles) where drainage was not an
issue [ 53]. Studies of 3D foams on Earth are generally restricted to small liquid fractions ϕ≪0.1, where drainage is
slow enough [5, 11].
To rule out artifacts related to gravity in 3D foams whatever the liquid fraction, we have performed foam coarsening
experiments in microgravity, on board the International Space Station (ISS), where drainage is suppressed. Samples
with arbitrary liquid volume fractions ϕcan thus be studied over long times, up to several days, as required to investigate
the Scaling State of foam containing a significant fraction of liquid.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Excess of small bubbles

been superimposed on the image to highlight the small bubbles corresponding to the sharp peak in the distribution shown
in (b). (b) Probability density function of normalized bubble radius ρ=R/⟨R⟩at different foam ages as indicated, for
a foam with liquid fraction ϕ= 15% . The curve corresponding to age >2000 s represents the Scaling State regime, for
which the normalized distribution no longer evolves. Inset: evolution of the proportion of small bubbles as a function of
time. The number fraction f smallis obtained by dividing the number of bubbles with radius R < R tby the total number
of bubbles in the sample (see Section 2.2 for details). A change in Rtby±5%induces a variation of f smallsmaller than
the point size. (c) Probability density function of normalized bubble radius at different ages as indicated, for a sample
with liquid fraction ϕ= 8% studied on ground.
We have investigated foam coarsening for liquid fractions between 15% and 50% using the instrument described in [ 4].
Details can be found in the Materials and Methods section. From the sample surface observations (a typical image is
shown in Fig. 1a), we measure the bubble sizes using image analysis, and determine the bubble size distributions of
the radius normalized by its average ρ=R/⟨R⟩. The initial size distributions produced by our experimental setup
are asymmetric (positive skew) with a maximum at ρ≈0.6(see Figure 1b for foam with 15% liquid fraction as an
example). The normalized size distributions broaden with time, and a sharp peak builds up progressively for small
bubble sizes, i.e.ρ≈0.3, until a stationary form is reached, indicating a Scaling State. This is shown in Figure 1b
for times t >2000 s. This evolution is typical of the measurements we have made for foams with liquid fractions
within the range 15%≤ϕ < ϕ⋆, with ϕ⋆≈39%. The small bubbles corresponding to the peak in the distribution are
highlighted in Figure 1a. After an increase in the transient regime, they finally represent about 35% of the total bubble
population in the scaling state (inset of Figure 1b). We also measured the number of those small bubbles per foam
vertex to reach a maximum average value of 1.5, due to space limitation in the vertices. As a consequence, the size
distribution becomes invariant in time (statistically self-similar) as observed.
Up to now, such an excess of small bubbles has not been reported in the literature [ 35,16,30,61]. In order to check if
distributions with an excess of small bubbles are also found in drier foams, we have performed coarsening experiments
using the same surfactant and a liquid fraction of 8%, low enough for gravity effects to be compensated in a ground
based experiment by rotating the cell around a horizontal axis (clinostat). As shown in Figure 1c we observed a similar
excess of small bubbles. The small bubbles were thus seemingly present, but not detected in previous studies. This is
probably because high spatial resolution together with a careful image analysis are needed [ 44]. The only experimental
work we have found that indirectly relates to this is that of Feitosa and Durian [ 16], which reports the development
of transient bidispersity for initially monodisperse bubbles in a Steady State column, where drainage and coarsening
occur simultaneously. In their simulations of 2D foam coarsening, Khakalo et al [26] have observed an excess of small
bubbles but the gas transfer through interstitial bulk liquid was not taken into account. Other peculiar size distributions
such as “Apollonian” distributions were observed during the decay of beer foam [ 51] and with emulsions [ 27]. In
contrast to what happens in our systems, they arose from coalescence events.
Forϕ > ϕ⋆we have observed a different scenario: the initial bubble size distribution shrinks until a steady state is
reached where the size distribution is notably narrow (see Fig. S1 in the SI). The latter distribution is reminiscent of
the theoretical distribution predicted for the Ostwald regime [ 33,57]. Around ϕ∗, a change in the growth laws for the

at the wall when its shrinking abruptly slows down (see text). Each label corresponds to a different bubble. (b) The
transition to the very small shrinking rate was observed to occur when the foam bubble has become so small that it fits
inside the interstice between neighboring larger bubbles. The corresponding geometrical transition can therefore be
described as follows: When its radius is larger than Rt, the small bubble is a foam bubble, in the fact that it shares thin
liquid films with its neighbors. In contrast, as its radius reaches values smaller than Rt, the bubble loses its contacts with
its neighbors: it becomes a roaming bubble and its shrinking rate is strongly decreased. (c) Coefficient xn=Rt/R32

The Sauter mean radius R32=⟨R3⟩/⟨R2⟩is defined as the ratio of third to second moments of the bubble radius
distribution.
2.2 Transition from jammed bubbles to roaming bubbles
To clarify the origin of the hierarchical bubble population, we have identified bubbles that eventually disappear
and tracked evolution of their area. Figure 2a shows examples of such measurements in a foam with ϕ= 15% .
Similar data are shown for other liquid fractions between ϕ= 20% andϕ= 33% in the Supplementary Information
(cf. Figure S2). Over time, the individual bubble area can either increase or decrease, depending on the bubble’s gas
exchanges with its neighbours, but most of the observed bubbles eventually shrink (see Figure 2a). The magnitude
of the shrinking rate appears to be initially similar to that characterizing the initial growing rate. Then, a transition
occurs and the area decreases much more slowly. Actually, the shrinking after this transition can be extremely
slow, and we think this is the underlying mechanism explaining why a peak at smaller than average bubbles builds
up in the size distribution. Remarkably, the bubble radius at the transition, Rt, is such that its area At=πR2
t
increases linearly with time, which is similar to the evolution of the squared mean radius in the Scaling State (Eq. 1).
Moreover, the transition to the very small shrinking rate appears to occur when the bubble has become so small
that it fits inside the interstice between three larger bubbles at the surface, and possibly loses contacts with them as
sketched in Fig. 2b. (See movies S1-S3 in the SI.) They are free to move throughout the interstice without being
pressed against multiple neighbors. Such small bubbles can have different configurations in the interstice, i.e.near
the center of the interstice or in contact with one bubble or two bubbles, but these configurations do not last for
the entire life of the bubbles because their positions are jostled as the jammed bubbles intermittently rearrange
due to the coarsening induced dynamics [ 9,6]. We call the small bubbles roaming bubbles . Note that they are
reminiscent of rattlers (grains carrying no force) in granular media [ 1]. We conjecture that the bubble size at the
transition, Rt, should scale as the maximum radius of a sphere that can be trapped in such an interstice at the wall surface.
4Hierarchical bubble size distribution in coarsening wet liquid foams A P REPRINT
In a coarsening foam that has reached the Scaling State, there is only one independent length scale of the bubble
packing structure. Since the bubbles that form the interstices are bigger than the encaged roaming bubbles, we chose
to characterize their average size by the Sauter mean radius. With respect to ⟨R⟩,R32indeed represents mainly the
average radius of the larger bubbles of the distribution and minimizes the contribution of the small bubbles. At a time t,
the maximum radius of a sphere trapped in such a vertex can be written, on average:
Rt(t, ϕ) =xn(ϕ)R32(t) (3)
where xn(ϕ)is a dimensionless geometrical coefficient. We show in Figure S3 of the SI the plots of Rtversus R32for
each liquid fraction. The plots are reasonably described by equation 3, allowing determination of the average coefficient
xnfor each liquid fraction (see Figure 2c). xn(ϕ)varies from 0.25to0.55asϕvaries from 15% to38% respectively.
Using those xnvalues, the transition radii Rtcollapse on a linear master curve when plotted versus xn(ϕ)R32(cf.
Figure S3 of the SI).
We have performed a geometrical calculation of the size of the interstice between a plane and three perfect spheres
of equal radius R32in contact together and with the plane (see Figure 2c). This leads to xn= 1/3. This value
is smaller than what is measured for liquid fractions corresponding to the bubble random close packing fraction,
i.e.ϕrcp≈31% (see section 2.4 for more details), beyond which the bubbles are spherical. As the liquid fraction
gets close to ϕrcp, the foam osmotic pressure, which pushes neighboring bubbles against each other at contacts,
becomes very low, and it can be inferred that the cage formed by the triplets of bubbles of radius R32loosens. Note
that such a geometrical loosening effect is general and independent of friction [ 10]. Therefore, as a correction to
the previous calculation, a distance ϵR32is added around each sphere (see Figure 2c). The coefficient now reads:
xn=ϵ(2+ϵ)+4
3(1+ϵ)2
2(2+ϵ)≈1
3+ϵ, and it increases significantly due to the loosening effect: assuming a moderate loosening
ϵ≈0.gives xn≈0.5which is in better agreement with our measurements (see Figure 2c and movie S2). It is
reasonable to assume that polydispersity may also impact the size of the interstice. This effect can be estimated
by considering two bubbles of size R32and a third one with size βR 32. It can be shown that in such a case, the
coefficient reads xn≈1
3+ 0.11(β−1). Therefore, the magnitude of the polydispersity effect is much weaker than
the previous one, in addition to the fact that it can work in both directions, depending on the value of β, which we
observed to vary in the range 0.3< β < 1.5(see Figure S4 of the SI). However, it is worth noting that a significant
fraction of bubbles have a radius larger than R32,i.e.1≤β≤1.5, and that almost half of the nodes are bounded
by one such large bubble (see Figure S4 as an example for foam with 15% liquid). These findings suggest that
the effect of polydispersity is only slightly positive, and should only slightly increase xni.e. the size of the wall
interstice. We conclude that the loosening of the bubble packing is the main effect accounting for the measured xnvalues.
To extend our prediction to any liquid fraction ϕ≤ϕrcp, we turn to [ 34], where the radius of passage of a hard sphere
through the liquid channels (so-called Plateau borders [ 6]) was determined as a function of ϕand bubble radius Rin a
monodisperse foam. Due to uniformity of the capillary pressure through the foam, which sets the radius of curvature of
the channels, and thus their cross-section, the bubble radius at the transition Rtshould be proportional to this radius of
passage. Following the approach proposed in [ 34] we refer to the effective pore radius introduced by Johnson et al. [24]:
Λ≈(8∼
k/∼σ)1/2R, where∼
kis the dimensionless liquid Darcy’s permeability through the foam structure, i.e.k/R2, and
∼σis the ratio of the electrical conductivity of the foam to that of the foaming liquid. Therefore, the expression sought
forxnis:
xn=ξ(8∼
k/∼σ)1
2 (4)
where ξis a geometrical coefficient to be determined. Note that the latter is expected to account for the loosening and
polydispersity effects discussed previously. To continue we now need expressions for∼
kand∼σ. Since Λwas initially
proposed for solid porous media, the permeability should correspond to foam having rigid interfaces to mimic solid-like
boundary conditions. As studied by Rouyer et al. [48], its expression is given by:∼
k=ϕ2/(312(1 −2.15ϕ+ 1.37ϕ2)2)
within the range of liquid fractions 1%≤ϕ≤40%. For foams and bubbly liquids, Feitosa et al. [15] proposed an
approximate analytical expression for∼σ,i.e.∼σ= 2ϕ(1 + 12 ϕ)/(6 + 29 ϕ−9ϕ2). Using these expressions, we set
ξ= 2.2in equation 4 in order to get a predicted value of xnclose to the measured value 0.53 for ϕ≈ϕrcp(see
Figure 2c). Remarkably, the agreement with our experimental data is very good over the whole range of liquid fractions,
which reinforces the physical picture that Rtactually corresponds to the size of the interstices formed by the jammed
bubbles around the roaming bubbles. Note that in all of the above, nothing is really specific to the fact that we are
looking at the wall. In bulk, typical interstices are formed by four bubbles in a tetrahedral assembly. The geometrical
calculation for four bubbles in contact gives√
3
2−1≈0.225, compared to 1/3at the wall. Therefore we can estimate
xnfor bulk by using equation 4 with coefficient ξ= 2.2×(0.225/0.333)≈1.5. Provided this value is used, the
5Hierarchical bubble size distribution in coarsening wet liquid foams A P REPRINT
behavior observed at the wall should be similar to the behavior observed in the bulk of the foam.
2.3 Dissolution rate of the roaming bubbles
In this section, we focus on the dissolution rate of the roaming bubbles in the range ϕ < ϕ∗. We first consider the data
for times longer than those that mark the intersection of the dissolution curve with A(t) =πR2
t(Figures 2a and S2 in
the SI). We follow the evolution of the radius of roaming bubbles R(t)forR(0)≲Rt. For comparison, we similarly
analyze individual bubbles roaming in the bubbly liquids ( ϕ > ϕ∗), from the instant they start to continuously shrink.
Several examples of the curves are presented in Figure 3a. We observe that the following function fits well all the
curves[12, 37]:
R2(t) =R2(0)−Ωrt (5)
where the only fitted parameter Ωrrepresents the dissolution rate of the roaming bubble. Such fits were performed for
all the liquid fractions and the average values of Ωrare presented in Figure 3b. Ωris found to depend only weakly on
liquid fraction: Ωr≈1−2µm2/s. We also plot on Figure 3b the growth rate Ωpthat characterizes the coarsening of
the foam in the Scaling State (Eq. 1). It appears that Ωp≫Ωrforϕ≲ϕrcp≈31%, and Ωp≈Ωrforϕrcp< ϕ < ϕ∗.
This comparison reinforces our discussion in section 2.1: the size of the roaming bubbles, represented on the left side of
the distribution, varies more slowly than the average bubble size. As a result, the roaming bubbles accumulate in the
interstices formed by the larger bubbles.
As the dissolution rate Ωrplays a crucial role in the accumulation mechanism of the roaming bubbles, we seek here
to understand this value. The starting point is the comparison of our data with theory for the dissolution of isolated
bubbles [ 12,37], which gives the steady dissolution rate far enough from the final instant of bubble disappearance
as:Ωr=−dR2/dt= 2DmVm(c(R)−c∞) = 2 DmVmHeP0(1−ζ), where the saturation parameter ζ=c∞/HeP0
characterizes the gas saturation of the liquid environment, c(R)andc∞are respectively the gas concentrations in
the liquid at the bubble surface and at infinity, P0is the gas pressure at infinity, HeandDmare respectively the
Henry solubility and the diffusion coefficient of the air molecules in the foaming solution. Vmis the molar volume
of the gas at the pressure P0. From the measured Ωr, we deduce an effective value for the saturation parameter:
ζ= 0.973−0.987, which suggests that the bubbles dissolve faster than if they were isolated, and despite the presence
of the large neighbouring bubbles which impose at their interface a gas concentration larger than HeP0. To explain this
apparent contradiction, it is important to understand that the gas transfer is controlled by the concentration gradient, and
not only by the concentration difference. Due to the short distances involved between the roaming bubble interface
and the interfaces of the large neighbouring bubbles, the concentration gradient around the roaming bubble reaches
relatively high values compared to the case of the isolated bubble. Therefore, to mimic this situation, we consider the
configuration illustrated in the inset of Figure 3b, where a roaming bubble of radius Ris centered in a cavity of radius
Rt, and is surrounded by a liquid shell of thickness Rt−R. The local concentration at the outside boundary of the
shell is estimated as that at the surface of a bubble of average size R32. From Fick’s first law, we then predict the bubble
dissolution rate Ωrin that shell environment (See more details in the SI). For the range of values of R32in the scaling
state in our experiments and typical ratio R/R t, we expect Ωr≈0.75−4µm2/s which provides boundaries consistent
with the measured values of Ωr(cf. Fig. 3b).
A drawback of this shell-like model is that the roaming bubble is assumed to remain at the center of the interstice,
which is not always the case. Indeed, we often noticed transient apparent contacts between the roaming bubble and
either one of the bubbles delimiting the interstice or two larger bubbles forming a corner. These transient contacts can
result from adhesive forces. We have indeed observed that under microgravity conditions, persistent aggregates form
spontaneously in dilute bubble dispersions. In complementary ground-based experiments, we have observed a contact
angle close to 3−4o[45]. The underlying configuration may be an adhesive contact with the formation of a liquid film
that slightly flattens the bubbles or it can be a near-contact with a small separation distance so that the roaming bubble
is spherical. Since it was not possible to distinguish between these two types of contact, we estimated the dissolution
rate for both cases (See details of the calculation in the SI). In the range of average bubble sizes R32of our experiments,
assuming a film thickness effective for the transport of gas of the order of 40-60 nm [ 45], we found that the expected
rates fall within the range of values measured for Ωr. This remains broadly true if the bubble is in a corner, where
the corresponding dissolution rate is twice larger. Therefore, whatever the configuration considered for the roaming
bubble in the interstice, we find values for its dissolution rate that are compatible with our measurements, which gives
robustness to the proposed mechanism based on the accumulation of long-lasting roaming bubbles in the foam interstices.

2.4 Bubble size distributions and random close packing fraction in the Scaling State
Let us analyze now the role of liquid fraction on the distribution shape. Details on the analysis are given in the SI.
Figure 4 shows the normalized bubble size distributions observed in the Scaling State for each sample liquid fraction.
The PDF for ϕ= 15% is the same as that of Figure 1 in the Scaling State. It exhibits a prominent narrow peak, that we
identified to the roaming bubble population in Section 2.1, followed by a broad peak for the foam bubble population.
These features qualitatively persist up to ϕ <38% but the narrow peak progressively shifts towards larger ρwhile its
height decreases. For ϕ≥40%, PDFs exhibit a single peak, which is consistent with the fact that all bubbles should be
roaming bubbles. PDFs become narrower as ϕincreases and their peak height increases. This qualitative change is also
captured by the abrupt variation of statistical quantities like polydispersity and standard deviation (cf. Fig. S5 of the SI).
None of the existing theories predict such distributions [3]. These findings indicate a cross-over between qualitatively
different PDFs occurring for a liquid fraction ϕ⋆≈39%. This transition coincides with the observed change of growth
laws Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 and it is attributed to the onset of the formation of a foam gel due to weak attraction between
bubbles as evidenced by finite contact angle at films junctions [45].
The expected jamming liquid fraction for randomly close-packed monodisperse hard spheres is ϕrcp= 36% . However,
polydispersity will reduce this value since smaller bubbles can fit into the interstices between larger ones. This effect
has been predicted by numerical simulations of polydisperse close packings of spherical particles with lognormal PDF,
as a function of the shape parameter σ[13,14]. In our foams, the close packing concerns the population of jammed
bubbles, which are connected to each other viafilms. Therefore, we compare the measured shape parameter of the
foam bubble distribution σ2to the predicted ones (cf. Fig. 3c). We find them to coincide within the range ϕ= 30% and
ϕ= 32% : we expect the close packing fraction ϕrcpof our foams to lay inside the range between these 2 values.
To provide an independent result of the close packing fraction of frictionless spheres with the polydispersity observed in
our samples in the Scaling State, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations. Since here we are only interested
in the geometrical sphere packing problem at the jamming point where the confinement pressure and interaction forces
drop to zero with increasing ϕ, we expect the nature of the interaction law used in the simulations to have only a minor
impact. Using Hertzian interactions, in the framework of the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS (see Materials and
Methods), we obtained ϕrcp=31.0±0.5%, in remarkable agreement with our analysis based on the work of Farr and
Groot [ 14]. Note that strictly speaking, our simulations only provide an upper bound for the optimal random close
packing fraction of such polydisperse spheres, which may be obtained by more sophisticated simulation procedures
described in the literature [ 25]. However, in the context of our experiments, the truly relevant packing fraction is the
one of a coarsening foam. In this case we expect a local packing which is not exactly the most compact possible one. A
jammed foam regularly undergoes rearrangements, helping it to settle into new minimal energy configurations. This
implies that in between rearrangements, the packing is not always optimally close-packed. Simulations of this where we
also replace the Hertzian interaction by the more realistic Morse Witten law [38, 22] are the subject of ongoing work.
2.5 Potential consequences on foam properties
The roaming bubbles represent a significant proportion of the total number of bubbles. As a result, exclusion of the
roaming bubbles from the determination of the average radius leads to an up to 3-fold overestimation of coarsening
rates, depending on the liquid fraction [45].
In terms of volume fraction with respect to the liquid volume, the roaming bubbles represent up to ten percent depending
onϕ. It can therefore be expected that their impact is important for certain properties. Roaming bubbles can also modify
foam drainage, where they slow down the flow of the liquid. A study with solid spheres, located in the nodes of the
liquid network of the foam, showed that such an amount of particles in the liquid could reduce the permeability of the
foam by 40% [49]. This shows the bias of systematically ignoring their presence. Let us mention that to date, this effect
has never been taken into account in permeability modelling.
The presence of the roaming bubbles can be highly detrimental for applications of foams where the microstructure is an
important parameter, all the more so if they migrate and accumulate in large proportions in certain places. Moreover,
for a number of these applications, the interstitial liquid is a complex fluid, possibly with yield stress properties that will
prevent gravity from evacuating the roaming bubbles: one expects to find relatively high volume fractions of roaming
bubbles in such systems.
By examining some recent papers on foamed construction materials, we recognised traces of the presence of such
roaming bubbles. For example in [ 17], very small pores can be seen in the bulk nodes of cement foam solidified after
coarsening, as revealed by the micro-tomography image. There is every reason to believe that literature is full of such
examples.

Figure 4: Bubble size distributions of normalized radius ρ=R/⟨R⟩for each liquid fraction as labelled. The data are
represented by black continuous lines. The green dashed lines represent the bi-lognormal PDFs (see Eq. 6 in the SI)
fitted to the data. The red (resp. blue) shaded area corresponds to the roaming bubble PDF wL(r;m1, σ1)(resp. to the
foam bubble PDF (1−w)L(ρ;m2, σ2)) with the parameters given in Fig. S5 of the SI. In the plots for ϕup to 38%
the width of the roaming bubble distributions is characterized by ρt, defined in Eq. 8 in the SI. For ϕ= 15% , the dotted
line is the PDF predicted for wet foams by Markworth [ 36] based on Lemlich’s model [ 32] for that ϕ. As a comparison,
forϕ= 50% , the dotted line is the LSW prediction [3] ( ϕ= 1).

On the other hand, one can make use of these roaming bubbles. Note that the stakes are high in terms of producing
solid foam structures with hierarchical porosity, including both macro- and micro-scaled pores. Such structures have
recently been produced by 3D printing [ 7] and they were found to present enhanced energy absorption properties and
enhanced mechanical resistance to cyclic loading.
Conclusions
Studies of foam samples where the liquid fraction remains constant over periods of several days, without any confounding
effects of gravitational drainage, reveal that, as demonstrated earlier for dry foams, wet foams evolve towards a Scaling
State. In this state, the bubble size distributions show a well-defined peak towards smaller than average sizes, i.e. an
excess of bubbles for sizes close to 0.3⟨R⟩. This feature is not predicted by existing theories. During coarsening, as
shrinking bubbles become smaller than the size of interstices between the larger bubbles, they can move independently
from the jammed bubble network to become roaming bubbles. Surprisingly, although we have been able to reproduce
this effect on Earth, no previous experimental study mentions the presence of these small bubbles, except for a study
of draining foams [ 16] but where roaming bubbles have not been identified as such.This suggests that, although their
study has been underestimated, hierarchical bubble size distributions can build up on Earth if drainage is not too fast
compared to dissolution and coarsening.
The dissolution rate of these roaming bubbles is approximately constant, whatever the liquid fraction of the samples.
The dissolution rate is consistent with calculations based on the gas transfer through the liquid shell that surrounds
the roaming bubble, or through the “contact“ between one roaming bubble and larger jammed bubbles surrounding
them. The key point in the accumulation of the small bubbles in the interstices formed by the larger bubbles, is the fact
that the rate of disappearance of these bubbles is much smaller than the average growth rate of the jammed bubbles.
This behaviour is observed for foams with liquid fractions smaller than the random close packing fraction ϕrcp. For ϕ
between ϕrcpandϕ⋆, where the bubble assembly approaches the regime of bubbly liquids , the rate of dissolution of
the roaming bubbles reaches progressively the growth rate of the jammed bubbles, which suppresses the accumulation
mechanism. As a consequence, the peak initially observed for liquid fractions ϕ < ϕ rcpshifts towards ⟨R⟩and a
distribution almost centered on ⟨R⟩, characteristic of bubbly liquids, is eventually observed. For ϕabove ϕ∗, none of
the bubbles are confined.
In closing, we have shown the existence of naturally developed hierarchical bubble size distributions in coarsening
foams. We present a comprehensive view of coarsening of wet foams, completely different from expectations, with a
persistent co-existence of jammed bubbles with small roaming bubbles, and the existence of a range between ϕrcpand
ϕ∗where foam bubbles are still jammed although not close-packed. These findings challenge our current understanding
of foam coarsening and has potential implications in the design and performance of foamy materials. This view should
not be restricted to foams but also be applicable to other two-phase systems driven by interfacial effects, such as
emulsions, alloys and binary fluid/polymer mixtures. It should be mentioned that recent studies of alloys with small
volume fraction of the continuous phase suggest that the Ostwald ripening regime persists when ϕis smaller than ϕrcp
[60]. The difference between coarsening of foams and alloys remains to be clarified.
Materials and Methods
The foams were made with aqueous solutions of a ionic surfactant, tetradecyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (TTAB),
with purity ≥99% and used as received from Sigma-Aldrich. It was dissolved at 5 g/L in ultrapure water (resistivity
18.2 M Ω·cm). This concentration is 4 times larger than the critical micellar concentration and large enough to prevent
coalescence. The surface tension of the TTAB solution measured at room temperature is: γ= 37.1mN/m. The Henry
solubility coefficient of the air molecules in the foaming solution is [ 45]He= 7.4 10−6mol m−3Pa−1[45] and their
diffusion coefficient in the foaming solution is [45] Dm= 2.0 10−9m2s−1.
The majority of the experiments were performed on board the International Space Station using the experiment container
described in [ 4]. In this environment, the residual gravity acceleration fluctuations are reported to be on the order of or
less than a µg, for frequencies below 0.01 Hz [ 41]. Each foam cell was filled on Earth with a given volume of foaming
solution (measured by weight at controlled temperature) and air, then hermetically sealed. The liquid volume fraction
ϕcontained in each cell was deduced from the liquid volume and the total cell volume. After the completion of the
experiments, the cells were send back to Earth and we checked that their weight had varied by less than 1%. All the
experiments were repeated three times and found reproducible, even a few months apart.
In addition, we made a Ground experiment with a foaming liquid of composition identical to that of the ISS experiments.
The foams were produced with the double syringe method [ 44] filled with air and a volume of the foaming solution in
order to set the liquid fraction to 7.8% ±0.2%. Note that the initial bubble size distribution with this foam production is
10Hierarchical bubble size distribution in coarsening wet liquid foams A P REPRINT
close to that of the Scaling State. The sample was placed in a cylindrical cell (diameter 30 mm, thickness 12.8 mm)
with transparent flat faces. The cell was kept with its symmetry axis aligned in the horizontal direction and rotated
about this axis with a speed of rotation equal to 15 rpm.
Foam age is counted from the instant when the foaming process stops. Bubbles at the surface of the sample are recorded
using a video camera. Every image (such as the one shown in Fig. 1a) was analysed as described in [ 44]. We checked
that the radial profile of liquid fraction remained constant throughout the measurement duration, indicating that the
effect of gravity drainage was indeed counteracted and that the rotation did not induce radial drainage either.The bubble
areaAdeduced was from the area inside the contour of the bubbles measured using the ellipses method [ 44]. Finally,
the bubble radius is calculated as R=p
A/π. In the ISS experiments, simultaneously to the video recording, the
intensity of light transmitted through the sample was recorded, which provided the average bubble size in the bulk of
the sample as explained in [ 44]. Our results showed that the evolution of the average bubble radius measured either at
the surface or in the bulk are similar.
We also performed numerical simulations to evaluate the random close packing liquid fraction of the bubbles. In
the framework of the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS [ 55], a cubic simulation box was filled by spheres with
repulsive, Hertzian interactions with radii randomly chosen from a distribution corresponding to the one we observe
experimentally for ϕ= 33% in the Scaling State (see Figure 4). The number of spheres was of the order of 2000,
similar to our foam coarsening experiments at the largest investigated foam ages. To fill the simulation cell, we started
with an initial cell volume so large that the sphere dispersion was highly diluted. Using the pressostat provided by
LAMMPS, we then shrunk the cubic cell and compacted these structures until a very small osmotic pressure appeared.
We then turned off the pressostat and equilibrated the sample for imposed simulation box volumes, varied by small
steps around the previous value. The close packing fraction was estimated by plotting confinement pressure versus
packing fraction, and by detecting the ϕvalue where zero pressure is reached within numerical accuracy. We did this
for 5 different initial random seeds, and found ϕrcp=31.0±0.5%. The way you compact a packing has a large impact
on the final close packing fraction in frictional granular materials, and to a lesser extent also in frictionless systems. To
investigate this effect, we applied simulated gravity to dilute sphere dispersions as an alternative to the initial pressostat
procedure. Kinetic energy was dissipated by introducing viscous friction in the contact law. This procedure mimics
foams that form when a bubbly liquid is subjected to buoyancy, as it is common on earth. Once equilibrium was reached,
we switched off gravity, and simulated pressure versus packing fraction as previously. The final values of ϕrcpare within
statistical errors the same as the those obtained with the pressostat.

Supplementary Information
Dissolution rate models
We consider the configuration illustrated in the inset of Figure 3b, where a roaming bubble of radius Ris centered
in a cavity of radius Rtand surrounded by a liquid shell of thickness Rt−R. Denoting rthe radial distance from
the bubble center, the gas concentrations at r=Randr=Rtare imposed by the bubble Laplace pressures, i.e.
c(R) =He(P0+ 2γ/R)andc(Rt) =He(P0+ 2γ/R 32), where the local concentration at the outside boundary
of the shell is estimated as that at the surface of a bubble of average size R32. With these boundary conditions, the
dissolved gas concentration profile is only a function of the radial coordinate r. It is a solution of the steady diffusion
equation and is given byc(r)−c(R)
c(Rt)−c(R)=Rt
Rt−R(1−R/r). From Fick’s first law, the molar rate of gas transfer outwards
from the roaming bubble is equal to −4πR2Dm(dc/dr )r=R, and the resulting dissolution rate is:
Ωr=4γDmVmHe
R(1
R−1
R32)
(1
R−1
Rt)(S1)
Values provided by equation S1 depend on estimates of the different radii that have been introduced. We choose R32
within the range of values corresponding to our experiment in the Scaling State, i.e. 300µm≲R32≲500µm [S45],
and we limit the ratio R/R twithin the range 0.2−0.8(forR/R t≲0.2the size of roaming bubbles is measured with
less precision, and for R/R t≳0.8it is difficult to be sure that the tracked bubble is still a roaming bubble). Thus, we
get values for Ωrwithin the range 0.75−4µm2/s, as represented in Figure 3b.
As explained in the Main text, we noticed transient apparent contacts between the roaming bubble and either one of
the bubbles delimiting the interstice or two larger bubbles forming a corner. The underlying configuration may be a
real contact, i.e. with the formation of a liquid film that slightly flattens the bubbles, or it can be a near-contact with a
small separation distance, in which case the roaming bubble remains spherical. Since it is not possible to distinguish
between these two types of contact, we estimate the dissolution rate for both cases. First we consider the case of
the near-contact. We refer to the work of Schimming &Durian [ S52], who considered the so-called kissing bubbles
configuration, where the distance hbetween the two spherical bubbles is such that h/R≪1. We assume two bubbles
of radii R≈Rt/2≈R32/6andR32(radius of surrounding jammed bubbles). The dissolution rate of the small bubble
then writes:
Ωr≈2γDmVmHe1

(S2)
Because of the logarithm values provided by equation S2 are weakly dependent on h. A typical value for Ωris2µm2/s.
Now we consider the case of a small bubble of radius Rand a big bubble of radius R32sharing a film, of thickness h
and area A, which meets the free surface of the bubbles with a contact angle θ[S19] (cf. Fig. S7). The dissolution rate
of the small bubble is set by the Laplace pressure difference ∆Pbetween both bubbles, which drives the gas transfer
through the contact film and sets its curvature. It writes:
Ωr≈DmVmHe
2π R h∆P A (S3)
The film is a spherical cap surface with its radius of curvature R⋆(cf. Fig. S7) given by:
∆P=4γ
R⋆= 2γ1
R−1
R32
(S4)
The surface area A= 2πR⋆2(1−cos(ψ/2)). Taking the same range of bubble radii as above R≈Rt/2≈R32/6
and for the small contact angles considered here, geometrical considerations shows that at leading order ψ/2≈5θ/7,
thusA≈π
2R⋆2θ2. Then the dissolution rate(Eq. S5) writes:
Ωr≈12γDmVmHe
5hθ2(S5)
Values provided by Eq. S5 depend on the film thickness and contact angle. For our foams, we have θ≈4◦[S45].
We remark that an effective film thickness in the range h≈40−60nm gives a dissolution rate close to the rate
1Hierarchical bubble size distribution in coarsening wet liquid foams A P REPRINT
calculated for the kissing bubbles configuration, i.e. ≈2.6−4µm2/s. Note that the effective thickness accounts for
both the aqueous core film thickness and the effective length related to gas transfer resistance from the two surfactant
monolayers. Therefore, h≈40−60nm may well correspond to either a Newton Black Film (NBF) with significant
monolayer effect, or to a Common Black Film (CBF) with limited monolayer effect. It seems difficult to go further in
this quantitative analysis but it is in good agreement with the effective thickness obtained from the foam coarsening rate
with the same solution [S45].
To estimate the dissolution rate when the bubble is in a corner, we can, as a first approximation, multiply the previous
values by a factor of two. For the kissing bubbles configuration we get a dissolution rate equal to the upper range of
values provided by the shell-model, i.e. 4µm2/s. Values for roaming bubbles sharing two liquid films with neighboring
larger bubbles exceed a little bit that range, i.e. 5−8µm2/s. As we did not measure such high values, it suggests that
such a configuration, if it really exists, is rather rare.
Therefore, whatever the configuration considered for the roaming bubble in the interstices, we find values for its
dissolution rate that are compatible with our measurements, which gives robustness to the proposed mechanism based
on the accumulation of long-lasting roaming bubbles in the foam interstices.
Analysis of bubble size distributions
We first transformed the measured discrete histograms into continuous PDFs using a Gaussian Kernel estimation (with
bandwidth equal to 2.5 the image pixel size ≈14µm). We then described the two bubble populations (either roaming
bubble or jammed bubble) in the domain ϕ < ϕ⋆with a bimodal lognormal PDF defined as:
F=w· L(ρ;m1, σ1) + (1 −w)· L(ρ;m2, σ2) (S6)
where wis the proportion of roaming bubbles in the foam, and Lis a lognormal distribution parameterized as:
L(ρ;m, σ) =1
ρσ√
2πexp
−log2(ρ/m)
2σ2
. (S7)
where the shape parameter σis the log-scale standard deviation and mis the linear-scale median. We fitted the
bimodal function to the measured PDFs, and observed that the parameter m2= 1.66±0.03(SEM )is almost
independent of the liquid fraction. In the following, we fix m2= 1.66and fit the other parameters. Their
variations with liquid fraction are given in Fig. S5. The results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test [ S43]
applied to the bimodal lognormal fits provide quantitative evidence for fit quality: no fit could be rejected ac-
cording to the 5%rule, and many are above 40 %(with the exceptions of p(ϕ= 15%) = 21% andp(ϕ= 25%) = 14% ).
Finally, since Rtshould represent the maximum size of the roaming bubbles, we conjecture that it should be correlated
to the width of the roaming bubble PDF. To test this, we measure the width at the foot of the PDF L(ρ;m1, σ1)by the
normalized radius ρtestimated such that number of roaming bubbles with ρ > ρ tequals the number of jammed bubbles
withρ < ρ t:
(1−w)Zρt
0L(ρ;m2, σ2) =wZ∞
ρtL(ρ;m1, σ1). (S8)
We have estimated ρt(ϕ)up to ϕ=ϕ∗, and in Figure S6 we compare it to xn(ϕ). Since we employed R32as the
reference radius in the estimation of xn, we must rescale ρtbyR32for a comparison with xn. In the range of liquid
fractions up to ϕ=ϕrcp, we find ρt⟨R⟩/R32≈xn, which is consistent.

The additional figures support discussions in the Main text. We did not include text there, the captions being self-
explanatory.

for a foam with liquid fraction ϕ= 50% . The curve corresponding to age >20000 s represents the Scaling State
regime (observed up to 300000s - end of the experiment), for which the normalized distribution no longer evolves. This
distribution is an example of a concentrated bubbly liquid, with a single peak and a narrow distribution with bubble
sizes strictly smaller than ρ= 2.

withϕ= 30% or38%, data were acquired in parallel with other samples. As a consequence, there are some blanks in
the image in between the vertical lines.

Figure S4: Image of a sample with ϕ= 15% in the Scaling State (foam age t= 9645 s). The maximum radius of a
roaming bubble, Rt, at this foam age is predicted from the value of R32at this age using Eq. 3. Each bubble is then
classified as a roaming (resp. foam) bubble if its radius is smaller (resp. bigger) than Rt. In the figure, roaming (resp
foam) bubbles are identified by red (resp. cyan) spots at their centers. We used the jammed bubbles’ center positions
to analyze the foam structure by triangulation (black lines joining the centers in overlay). We estimated the number
of surface nodes, identified by green spots, and localized at the barycenter of the triangles. On average, we counted
1.5 roaming bubbles per node, and 1.2 nodes per jammed bubble. (right) CDF of the number fraction of nodes around
bubbles as a function of their normalized radius R/R 32, evaluated for the sample shown in the left. We see that the
median is very close to R=R32which means that nearly half of the nodes are delimited by a jammed bubble larger
thanR32. This is consistent with the choice of R32as the characteristic radius of jammed bubbles constituting the
nodes. Similar findings are found for liquid fractions up to ϕrcp≈31%.
