As
 
both
 
the

depend
 
strongly
 
on

a

Under

the

on

fundamentally

In

possesses
 
two
 
distinct

that
 
have
 
different

The
 
ABC

graphene
 
is
 
centrosymmetric
 
and
 
semiconducting
,
 
while
 
the

is
 
non

centrosymmetric
 
and
 
semimetallic
 
(Figs

This
 
unique
 
characteristic
 
of

it
 
an
 
exciting

for

at
 
a

of

K.
 
The
 
ABA
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
shows
 
a
 
single
 
Raman
 
peak
 
at
 
∼
1588
 
cm
-
1
,
 
assigned
 
as
 
Raman
 
phonon
 
G
 
mode.
 
In
 
striking
 
contrast,
 
ABC
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
clearly
 
shows
 
an
 
additional
 
low
 
wav
e
 
number
 
peak
 
at
 
∼1572
 
cm
-
1
,
 
which
 
is
 
absent
 
in
 
ABA
 
trilayer
 
graphene.
 
This
 
characteristic
 
Raman
 
peak
 
is
 
also
 
confirmed
 
by
 
measurements
 
under
 
633nm
-
laser
 
excitation
 
and
 
at
 
300
 
K
 
(refer
 
to
 
Fig.
 
S1).
 
The
 
new
 
Raman
 
peak
 
at
 
∼1572
 
cm
-
1
 
may
 
stem
 
from
 
an
 
infrared
 
active
 
phonon
 
mode.
 
To
 
confirm
 
this
 
hypothesis,
 
we
 
carried
 
out
 
far
-
field
 
infrared
 
spectroscopy
 
measurements
 
and
 
the
 
corresponding
 
spectra
 
are
 
shown
 
in
 
Fig.
 
2c.
 
Remarkably,
 
the
 
infrared
 
absorption
 
peak
 
matches
 
the
 
low
 
wave
 
number
 
Raman
 
peak,
 
suggesting
 
tha
t
 
this
 
low
 
wavenumber
 
Raman
 
peak
 
is
 
the
 
infrared
 
active
 
phonon
 
mode.
 
 
As
 
mentioned
 
above,
 
this
 
infrared
 
active
 
phonon
 
mode
 
requires
 
the
 
breaking
 
of
 
the
 
inversion
 
symmetry
 
of
 
ABC
 
trilayer
 
graphene.
 
To
 
confirm
 
this,
 
w
e
 
further
 
performed

sp
ectroscopy.

Besides,
 
the

graphene
 
at

are
 
also
 
shown
 
in

Notably,
 
the
 
frequencies
 
of
 
phonon
 
G
 
mode
 
of
 
both
 
ABA
 
and
 
ABC
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
are
 
strongly

.

Note
 
that
 
the
 
Dir
ac
 
point
 
of
 
our
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
device
 
is
 
at
 
a
 
gate
 
voltage
 
of
 
>80
 
V
 
(See
 
Figure
 
S3),
 
the
 
hole
 
density
 
is
 
gradually
 
increased
 
as
 
gate
 
voltages
 
sweep
 
from
 
80
 
V
 
to
 
–
60
 
V.
 
With
 
increasing
 
the
 
hole
 
density,
 
the
 
mode
 
of
 
ABA
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
and
 
high
 
wavenumb

of
 
ABC
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
harden,
 
indicating
 
both
 
are

In
 
marked
 
contrast,
 
the
 
low
 
wavenumber
 
component
 
of
 
ABC
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
softens
 
with
 
doping

confirming
 
the
 
antisymmetric

active
 
nature.
   
 
 
The
 
observa
tion
 
of
 
infrared
 
active
 
phonon
 
mode
 
in
 
centrosymmetric
 
ABC
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
by
 
Raman
 
spectroscopy
 
is
 
quite
 
surprising,
 
since
 
the
 
parity
 
is
 
a
 
conserved
 
quantity,
 
and
 
thus
 
Raman
 
and
 
infrared
 
transitions
 
are
 
mutually
 
exclusive.
 
One
 
possible
 
reason
 
is
 
that
 
th
e
 
inversion
 
symmetry
 
of
 
ABC
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
is
 
broken
 
by
 
dielectric
 
environment
 
doping,
 
enabling
 
the
 
infrared
 
active
 
phonon
 
mode
 
Raman
 
active.
 
Indeed,
 
our
 
transport
 
measurements
 
show
 
that
 
the
 
Dirac
 
point
 
is
 
far
 
shifted
 
to
 
a
 
gate
 
voltage
 
of
 
>
 
80V,

We

to

the

in

.
 
As
 
shown
 
in
 
Figs.

and
 
3c,
 
when
 
the
 
laser
 
frequency
 
is
 
not
 
at
 
the

frequency,
 
the

in

to

How
ever,
 
when
 
the

is
 
resonant
 
with

the

should
 
be

by
 
the

Electron

phonon
 
interactions
 
primarily
 
arise
 
from
 
the
 
coupling
 
between
 
phonon
 
resonances
 
and
 
interband
 
transitions.
 
Strong
 
interband
 
resonances
 
can
 
transfer
 
oscillator
 
strength
 
to
 
phonon
 
re
sonances,
 
leading
 
to
 
significant
 
enhancement
 
of
 
the
 
latter.
 
These
 
results
 
suggest
 
that
 
the
 
electron
-
infrared
 
phonon
 
coupling
 
strength
 
in
 
ABC
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
is
 
significantly

that
 
in

.
 
The
 
strong
 
electron

infrared

coupling
 
in
 
ABC

graphene
 
may
 
provide
 
new

into

as

play

Thanks
 
to
 
the
 
activated
 
infrared
 
phonon
 
in
 
ABC
 
trilayer
 
graphene,
 
Raman
 
spectroscopy
 
provides
 
an
 
alternative
 
and
 
high
-
throughput
 
technique
 
for
 
imaging
 
the
 
stacking
 
order
 
of
 
trilay
er
 
graphene.

shows
 
an

Fig.

presents

the

within
 
the
 
dotted
 
square
 
area
 
shown
 
in
 
Fig.
 
4a.
 
ABC
 
and
 
ABA
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
can
 
be
 
clearly
 
identifi
ed
 
by
 
the
 
dark
 
and
 
bright
 
regions,
 
respectively
.
 
Fig.

taken
 
from
 
the
 
same
 
region
 
as
 
in
 
Fig.

Obviously,
 
the
 
Raman
 
mapping
 
matches
 
well
 
with
 
the
 
SNOM
 
mapping
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
distinguishing
  
t
he
 
ABC
 
and
 
ABA
 
regions.
 
The
 
Raman
 
mapping
 
provides
 
a
 
fast,
 
simple,
 
non

destructive,
 
and
 
high
-
throughput
 
technology
 
for
 
identifying
 
the
 
stacking
 
order
 
of
 
multilayer
 
graphene.
 
 
In
 
summary,
 
our
 
research
 
has
 
shown
 
that
 
the
 
electron
-
infrared
 
phonon
 
coupling
 
str
ength
 
in
 
ABC
 
trilayer
 
graphene
 
is
 
significantly
 
stronger
 
than
 
in
 
ABA
 
trilayer
 
graphene.
 
This
 
discovery
 
provides
 
new
 
perspectives
 
on
 
the
 
understanding
 
of
 
superconductivity
 
and
 
other
 
physical
 
properties
 
of
 
ABC
 
trilayer
 
graphene.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
differences
 
in
 
electron
-
infrared
 
phonon
 
coupling
 
between
 
ABC
 
and
 
ABA
 
graphene
 
can
 
be
 
utilized
 
to
 
develop
 
a
 
novel,
 
non

and

Raman

for
