Abstract. This paper studies the basic K-theoretic properties of a triangulated persistence
category (TPC). This notion was introduced in [12] and it is a type of category that can be
viewed as a refinement of a triangulated category in the sense that the morphisms sets of a
TPC are persistence modules. We calculate the K-groups in some basic examples and discuss
an application to Fukaya categories and to the topology of exact Lagrangian submanifolds.

1.Introduction
The main aim of the paper is to study K-theoretic properties of triangulated persistence
categories (TPCs) and provide some applications of these properties in the setting of sym-
plectic topology. We recall from [12] (or its earlier version [11]) that a TPC is, roughly,
a persistence category C- that is a category with morphisms that are persistence modules
homC(A, B) ={homα
C(A, B)}α∈R, with composition compatible with the persistence structure
- such that the 0-level category C0, with the same objects as Cbut with only the 0-level
morphisms homC0(−,−) = hom0
C(−,−), is triangulated. The full definition and all relevant
notions are recalled in §2.4. The fundamental property of such a TPC Cis that the ∞-level
category, C∞, againwiththesameobjectsas Cbutwithmorphismsthe ∞-limitof hom C(−,−)
is also triangulated and that its exact triangles each carry a weight r≥0. Using this weight
one can define a family of fragmentation pseudo-distances on the objects of C, by taking into
account the weights required to decompose objects by means of exact triangles.
The basic K-theoretic constructions associated to a TPC Cappear in Section 3. Recall that
the Grothendieck group K(D)of a triangulated category Dis defined as the abelian group
freely generated by the objects of the category modulo the relations B=A+Cfor each exact
triangle A→B→C→TAinD, where Tis the translation functor of D.PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 3
Returning to the triangulated persistence category C, we define its K-group by
K(C) :=K(C0).
This is a linearization of Cthat transforms iterated cones involving only 0-weight triangles in
linear relations. Thus the K-class [X]∈K(C)of an object X∈Obj(C)can be viewed as an
algebraic invariant of Xin the rough sense that it is invariant under the 0-isomorphisms (see
Lemma 3.2.2). At the same time, because higher weight triangles are not used in the quotient
giving K(C), this K-group continues to carry relevant metric information.
The more precise aim of the paper is to understand more of the structure of this group, in
particular the interplay between the algebraic and metric aspects.
A first structural result relates K(C)to the K-group of the ∞-level of C,K∞(C) :=K(C∞).
We notice in §3 that there exists a long exact sequence of ΛP-modules:
0→TorK(C)→K(AC)→K(C)→K∞(C)→0. (1)
Here ΛPis the universal Novikov polynomial ring with integral coefficients (we recall its
definition in §2.1), and the K-groups of TPC’s are naturally ΛP-modules. The category AC
is the full subcategory of Cwhose objects are the objects of Cthat are isomorphic to 0in
C∞, this is called the acyclic subcategory of C. This ACis also a TPC thus the K-group,
K(AC) :=K(AC0), is defined as above. The term TorK(−)is a torsion type functor. To put
this in some perspective, recall from [12] that C∞is the Verdier localization C0/AC0.
In Section 4 we compute the relevant K-groups for categories of filtered chain complexes.
We will focus in this introduction on just one example, Cfg=H0(FChfg), the homotopy
category of finitely generated, filtered chain complexes. Filtered chain complexes (of different
types) provide the most common examples of TPCs. Additionally, these examples are also
universal in certain ways. For instance, we show that for C=Cfgthe exact sequence (1) can
be identified with the following one:
0→0→Λ(0)
P→ΛP→Z→0,
where Λ(0)
P⊂ΛPis the ideal consisting of the Novikov polynomials P(t)that vanish at t= 1,
i.e.P(1) = 0. The most interesting part of the identification of (1) with the latter sequence
is the isomorphism
K(Cfg)∼=− − → ΛP (2)
which shows that, in this case, the ΛP-module K(C)coincides with ΛPitself. We will denote
this isomorphism by λand outline its definition soon. The isomorphism K∞(Cfg)∼=− − →Zis
induced by the Euler characteristic.
The isomorphism λ:K(Cfg)∼=− − → ΛPis induced by the following way to associate a poly-
nomial to a filtered, finitely generated chain complex C. First associate to Cits (graded)
persistence homology H∗(C)(see §2.2 for a rapid review of the definitions). Then associate to4 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
H∗(C)its graded barcode BH∗(C). This consists of a finite collection of intervals (a.k.a. bars)
of the form [a, b)and[c,∞), where each interval has a certain degree in Z. To an interval
[a, b)of degree kwe associate the polynomial (−1)k(ta−tb)∈ΛP, and to an interval [c,∞)
of degree kwe associate (−1)ktc. Finally, we sum up the previously defined polynomials over
each interval in the graded barcode BH∗(C)and obtain a Novikov polynomial λH∗(C). The map
C7−→λH∗(C)∈ΛPinduces the isomorphism λ. An additional point to note here is that
K(C)is aΛP-algebra in case Chas a monoidal structure (as defined in §3.3). This is the case
forCfg, the monoidal operation being the tensor product, and the isomorphism λis a ring
isomorphism.
In Section 5 we investigate a natural way to associate to a graded persistence module, or
to a barcode, a real function. As a by-product we reinterpret the map C→[C]∈K(Cfg)that
associates to a filtered chain complex its K-class as a filtered Euler characteristic. Given a
persistence module M={Mα}α∈Rconsider the integral-valued function σM(α) = dim( Mα).
With the definition of persistence modules considered in this paper (see 2.2), and assuming
some finite type constraints, σM:R→Ris a bounded step function belonging to a group
of such functions, denoted by LCBand defined in §5.1. If M•is a graded persistence module
consisting of persistence modules Mifor each degree iit is natural to consider the Euler
characteristic function ¯χM•∈LCB,¯χM•=P
k(−1)kσMk. We show that LCBadmits a
remarkable ring structure based on convolution of functions and, with this ring structure,
it is isomorphic to the ring ΛP. Moreover, under this ring isomorphism LCB∼=ΛP, the
map M•→¯χM•∈LCBis another expression of λfrom (2). This chapter also contains - in
Proposition 5.3.1 - a persistence version of the Morse inequalities as well as an application to
counting bars, in Corollary 5.3.4.
InSection6wereturntothegeneralsettingandconsideratriangulatedpersistencecategory
C. Under some finite type constraints we show that there exists a bilinear pairing
κ:K(C)⊗ΛPK(C)→ΛP (3)
Here K(C)is the same abelian group as K(C)but with the ΛP-module structure ¯·such that
t¯·x=t−1·xwhere ·is the module structure on K(C). The pairing κis induced by the
map that associates to a pair of objects X, Ythe Novikov polynomial λhomC(X,T∗(Y))where
homC(X, T∗(Y))is the graded persistence module having homC(X, TiY)in degree i(recall
that Tis the translation functor in C0). In view of the discussion above, notice that κcan
be viewed as an Euler pairing. The pairing is particularly simple in the case of the category
Cfg. Using the identification K(Cfg)∼=ΛP, we have κ(P, Q)(t) =P(t−1)Q(t)for any two
polynomials P, Q∈ΛP. There are conditions - of Calabi-Yau duality type - implying that the
pairing κis skew symmetric in the sense that κ(x, y)(t) =κ(y, x)(t−1). These conditions are
satisfied for the category Cfg.PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 5
Section7isdedicatedtoanalyzing“measurements” on K-groups. Weseethatfragmentation
pseudo-distances on the objects of a TPC Ccan be used to define non-trivial group semi-norms
onK(C). We then discuss other ways to extract quantitative information from barcodes by
using their representation in LCB.
Section 8 deals with applications to symplectic topology. We discuss some results indicating
that the pairing κdefined on the K-group of the triangulated persistence Fukaya category
introduced in Chapter 3 of [12] distinguishes, in a quantitative way, embedded from immersed
Lagrangians. The main results are in Corollary 8.1.2 and Theorem 8.1.4. The corollary
shows that the pairing κ(A, A), where Ais the K-class of an embedded Lagrangian, is a
constant Novikov polynomial equal to the Euler characteristic of the Lagrangian (up to sign).
The theorem provides a way to estimate the minimal “energy” required to transform certain
immersed Lagrangians into embedded ones. The estimate is somewhat subtle as it involves
also estimates on the number of bars in certain associated barcodes that are deduced from
the persistence Morse inequalities in §5.

2.Prerequisites
We list here some of the conventions used further in the paper and we recall some of the
notions required to make the reading of this paper more accessible.
2.1.Novikov rings. We will use the following versions of the Novikov ring. We denote by
Λ =(∞X
k=0nktaknk∈Z, ak∈R,lim
k→∞ak=∞)
(4)
the Novikov ring with coefficients in Z(and formal variable t), endowed with the standard
multiplication. Denote also by ΛP⊂Λthe subring of Novikov polynomials, whose elements
consist of finitesumsPnktak∈Λ.
2.2.Persistence modules. The bibliography on persistence modules contains a large num-
ber of variants of the definition. We fix here the setting that we will use in this paper.
A persistence module Mis a family of vector spaces over the field k, indexed by the reals,
M={Ms}s∈R, together with maps is,t:Ms→Mtfor all s≤tsatisfying it,r◦is,t=is,rfor
alls≤t≤r∈Randis,s=1for any s∈R. We will always assume that the following three
conditions apply to the persistence modules Mconsidered here.
(i) (lower semi-continuity) For any s∈Rand any t≥ssufficiently close to s, the map
is,t:Ms→Mtis an isomorphism.
(ii) (lower bounded) For ssufficiently small we have Ms= 0.6 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
(iii) (tame) For every s∈R, we have
dimk(Ms)<∞. (5)
We will often use graded persistence modules. Namely, M•is a graded persistence module
ifM•={Mi}i∈Zis a sequence of persistence modules indexed by Zwith the index indicating
the degree. The tameness condition in this case becomes:
for every s∈R,dimk(⊕i∈ZMs
i)<∞. (6)
The homology of filtered chain complexes provides some of the most typical examples of
persistence modules. For our purposes here, a filtered chain complex is a triple (C∗, ∂, ℓ)
where (C∗, ∂)is a chain complex and ℓ:⊕iCi→R∪ {−∞} is a filtration function (see [35,
Definition 2.2]). In particular, ∂andℓare compatible in the sense that
ℓ(∂x)≤ℓ(x)for any x∈C∗.
It follows that for any r∈Rthe truncation (C≤r
∗, ∂)where C≤r
∗={x∈C|ℓ(x)≤r}is a
well-defined chain complex. The same holds also for the “strict” truncations C<r
∗.
We will consider mainly two types of filtered chain complexes:
(i)finitely generated - chain complexes for which the total space ⊕k∈ZCkis finite dimen-
sional, and moreover C≤r
∗= 0forrsufficiently small.
(ii)tame- chain complexes such that ⊕k∈ZC≤r
kis finite dimensional for all r∈R, and
moreover C≤r
∗= 0forrsufficiently small.
If a filtered chain complex Cis tame, then {C≤r
∗}r∈Rforms a graded persistence module in
the class discussed above. Moreover, the homology of these truncations, {H∗(C≤r)}r∈R, also
forms a graded persistence module in the same class. We will denote this persistence module
byH∗(C).
2.3.Barcodes. In this paper we will use the following version of barcodes. A barcode B=
{(Ij, mj)}j∈Jis a collection of pairs consisting of intervals Ij⊂Rand positive integers mj∈
Z>0, indexed by a set J, and satisfying the following admissibility conditions:
(i)Jis assumed to be either finite or J=Z≥0.
(ii) Each interval Ijis of the type Ij= [aj, bj), with −∞< a j< bj≤ ∞.
(iii) In case J=Z≥0we assume that aj→ ∞asj→ ∞.
The intervals Ijare called bars and for each j,mjis called the multiplicity of the bar Ij.
To every barcode Bwe can associate a persistence module in the following way. For an
interval I= [a, b)as above, denote by V(I)the persistence module defined by
Vs(I) =(
k,ifs∈I;
0,ifs /∈I,(7)
and with persistence maps is,t:Vs(I)−→Vt(I)being the identity map id kwhenever s, t∈I.
We call V(I)the interval module corresponding to I.PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 7
By taking direct sums we associate to every barcode B={(Ij, nj)}j∈Ja persistence module,
as follows:
V(B) :=M
j∈JV(Ij)⊕mj. (8)
It is easy to see that V(B)satisfies the conditions in §2.2. Conversely, it is well known that
this construction can be reversed. More precisely, with the conventions from §2.2, we have
that for every persistence module Mthere exists a unique barcode Bas above and such that
M∼=V(B). In other words, barcodes classify isomorphism types of persistence modules.
See [35, 28] for more details. We will denote the barcode corresponding to a persistence
module MbyBM.
We will need also the notion of graded barcodes. By this we mean a sequence of barcodes
B={Bi}i∈Zindexed by the integers and satisfying the following additional assumption.
Denote by Btotthe union of all the intervals in all the Bi’s, together with their multiplicities
and adding up multiplicities whenever bars from different Bi’s coincide). We assume that Btot
is an admissible barcode, in the sense that all the multiplicities appearing in it are finite, and
moreover that it satisfies the admissibility conditions (1), (2), (3) above.
We will often regard a single (ungraded) barcode Bas a graded one, simply by placing it
in degree 0.
LetB={(Ij, mj)}j∈Jbe an ungraded barcode. We associate to Ban element λB∈Λof
the Novikov ring as follows:
λB:=X
j∈JmjλIj, (9)
where
λIj:=(
taj−tbj,ifIj= [aj, bj);
taj,ifIj= [aj,∞).(10)
LetMbe a persistence module with barcode BM. Applying the construction above, we obtain
an element of the Novikov ring
λM:=λBM∈Λ. (11)
The definition of λMcan be extended to the graded case. Namely, let M•={Mi}i∈Zbe a
graded persistence module. Assume further the tameness condition in (6), then define:
λM•:=X
i∈Z(−1)iλMi∈Λ. (12)
A similar definition is available for graded barcodes.
2.4.Triangulated persistence categories. Triangulated persistence categories were intro-
duced in [11, 12]. We will only roughly review here some of the basics to make the current
paper more accessible.
A TPC is a category Cwith four properties summarized below (we refer to [12] for the full
definitions).8 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
(i)Cis a persistence category. This means that for each two objects A, BofC, the mor-
phisms homC(A, B)form a persistence module {homs
C(A, B)}s∈Rand that composition
of morphisms is compatible with the persistence structure in the obvious way. In the
current paper we will assume that these persistence modules are always lower-bounded
and lower-semicontinuous - see §2.2.
(ii)Ccarries a “shift functor” Σ. This is a structure composed of shift functors Σr:C → C
where Σr◦Σs= Σr+sfor all r, s∈RandΣ0=1that are compatible with the
persistence structure, and of natural isomorphisms ηr,s: Σr→Σssatisfying some
natural compatibility relations and with ηr,r=id,ηr,s∈homs−r(−,−).
Tokeepanexampleinmind, thesimplestTPCisthe(homotopy)categoryoffiltered
chain complexes. In that case ΣrCis obtained from the filtered chain complex Cby
shifting the filtration up by rand the natural transformation ΣrCηr,s−→ΣsCis the
identity at the vector space level, when the filtration is forgotten.
(iii) The category C0with the same objects as Cand whose morphisms are the 0-level
morphisms of C,hom0
C(−,−), is triangulated, Σris a triangulated functor (on C0), and
ηr,sare compatible with the additive structure on C0. Note that being triangulated,
C0has a translation functor T. This functor should not be confused with the shift
functor Σwhich has to do with shifting the persistence level. (Unfortunately the
names “shift” and “translation” functor are both used for the same thing in the context
of triangulated categories, often related to a shift or translation in grading. However
in our framework these two notions are absolutely different from each other.)
(iv) To formulate the last property that characterizes a TPC we need a couple more notions
that will also be useful later in the paper. We say that f, g∈homs
C(A, B)arer-
equivalent ifis,s+r(f−g) = 0. Here is,s+r: homs(−,−)→homs+r(−,−)are the
persistence structural maps. We write f≃rg. An object Kis called r-acyclicfor
some r≥0if1K≃r0.
For all r≥0, the natural transformation ηr,0: Σr→Σ0=1, specialized to
X∈Obj(C)belongs to hom−r(ΣrX, X )so we can apply to it i−r,0: hom−r(ΣrX, X )→
hom0(ΣrX, X ). The result is denoted by ηr=i−r,0(ηr,0)and thus ηr∈homC0.
Then the fourth property that defines a TPC is the following: For each r≥0and
object XofCthere is an exact triangle in C0
ΣrXηr−→X→K→TΣrX
with Kbeing r-acyclic.
Definition 2.4.1. (a) A triangulated persistence category Cis called tameif for any two
objects A, B∈Obj(C)the persistence module homC(A, B)satisfies condition (5) and is called
offinite type if the barcode of the persistence module homC(A, B)has only finitely many bars.
(b) The triangulated persistence category Cis calledboundedif for every two objects X, Y∈
Obj(C)there exists l∈Nwith the property that homC(X, TiY) = 0for every |i| ≥l. Here, T
is the translation functor of the triangulated category C0.PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 9
Obviously, ifaTPCistameand X, Y∈Obj(C)then λhomC(X,Y)∈Λiswell-defined. Further,
given X, Y∈Obj(C), consider the graded persistence module hom( X, T•Y)defined by:
hom( X, T•Y)i= hom C(X, TiY), i∈Z. (13)
IfCis tame and bounded, then the element
λhomC(X,T•Y)∈Λ (14)
is well defined. This element belongs to ΛPin case Cis of finite type and bounded.
A useful notion in a TPC is that of an r-isomorphism . This is a map f∈hom0
C(A, B)that
fits into an exact triangle Af−→B−→K−→TAinC0with K r-acyclic. An r-isomorphism
fadmits a right r-inverse, which is a map g∈hom0
C(ΣrB, A)with f◦g=ηr. There are also
leftr-inverses with a similar definition. But left and right inverses do not generally agree.
The key structure that is available in a TPC is that of strict exact triangle of weight r≥0.
This is a pair e∆ = (∆ , r), where r∈[0,∞)and∆is a triangle in C0,
∆ : A¯u−→B¯v−→C¯w−→ Σ−rTA,
which can be completed to a commutative diagram in C0
ΣrC

with u= ¯uand such that the following holds: the triangle Au−→Bv−→C′w−→TAis exact
inC0andϕis an r-isomorphism with an r-right inverse ψ. Theweightof the triangle ∆is
denoted by w(∆) = r.
The category C∞associated to Chas the same objects as Cbut its morphisms are:
homC∞(A, B) = lim
−→homα
C(A, B),
where the direct limit (or colimit) is taken along α∈Rwith respect to the standard order on
R(see [12, Definition 2.9 (ii)]).
The set of all r-acylic objects in C,r≥0, are the objects of a full subcategory ACofC. It
is easy to see that ACis itself a TPC and that its 0-level, AC0, is simply the full subcategory
ofC0with the same objects as AC. It is shown in [12, Proposition 2.38] that C∞is the Verdier
localization of C0with respect to AC0. This implies that C∞is triangulated.10 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
The exact triangles of C∞are related to the strict exact triangles of Cas follows. First,
given any diagram in C
∆ :Au−→Bv−→Cw−→D
we denote by Σs1,s2,s3,s4∆the diagram
Σs1,s2,s3,s4∆ : Σs1Au′
−→Σs2Bv′
−→Σs3Cw′
−→Σs4D
where the maps u′, v′, w′are obtained from u, v, wby composing with the appropriate ηr,s’s.
With this convention, a triangle ∆ :Au− →Bv− →Cw− →TAinC∞is calledexactif there exists
a diagram ¯∆ :A¯u− →B¯v− →C¯w− →TAinCthat represents ∆(in the sense that uis the∞-image
of¯uand similarly for the other morphisms), such that the shifted triangle
e∆ = Σ0,−s1,−s2,−s3¯∆ (16)
is strict exact (of weight s3) inCand0≤s1≤s2≤s3. Theunstable weight of∆,w∞(∆),
is the infimum of the strict weights w(e∆)of all the strict exact triangles e∆as above. Finally,
theweightof∆,¯w(∆), is given by:
w(∆) = inf {w∞(Σs,0,0,s∆)|s≥0}.
If there does not exist e∆as in the definition, then we put w∞(∆) = ∞.
The two notions of weight that are of most interest are wfor strict exact triangles in Cand
wC=wfor exact triangles in C∞.
2.5.Triangularweightsandfragmentationpseudo-metrics. Wediscussherethedefini-
tion of triangular weights and their application to the definition of a family of pseudo-metrics
on the objects of a triangulated category. Our main example of interest is the persistence
weight wCthat was recalled in §2.4.
LetDbe a (small) triangulated category and denote by TDits class of exact triangles. A
triangular weight wonDis a function
w:TD→[0,∞)
with two properties, one is a weighted form of the octahedral axiom (we refer to [12, Definition
2.1 (i)] for the precise formulation) and the other is a normalization axiom requiring that all
exact triangles have weight at least equal to some w0∈[0,∞)and this w0is attained for all
exact triangles of the form 0→X1X− − →X→0,X∈Obj(D), and their rotations.
An additional property one may require from a triangular weight is subadditivity. This
means that taking direct sums with triangles of the type 0→X1X− − →X→0does not increase
the weight. See [12, Chapter 2, Section 2.1] for the precise definitions.
The weight ¯wCrecalled in §2.4 is a triangular weight on C∞called the persistence weight
(induced from C). It is subadditive with ( ¯wC)0= 0.PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 11
Fix a triangulated category Dtogether with a triangular weight wonD. Let Xbe an
object of D. Aniterated cone decomposition DofXwithlinearization ℓ(D) = (X1, X2, ..., X n)
consists of a family of exact triangles in D:

with X=Yn(to include the case n= 1we set Y0= 0). The weight of such a cone decompo-
sition is defined by:
w(D) =nX
i=1w(∆i)−w0. (18)
LetF ⊂ Obj(D). For two objects X, X′ofD, define

and symmetrize:
dF(X, X′) = max {δF(X, X′), δF(X′, X)}. (20)
The weighted octahedral axiom implies that δFsatisfies the triangle inequality, hence dFis
a pseudo-metric, called the fragmentation pseudo-metric associated to wandF. See [12].
For a TPC C, as defined in §2.4, we will be interested in the fragmentation pseudo-metrics
onObj(C) = Obj( C∞)that are associated to the persistence weight ¯wCdefined on C∞.
In addition, there are some simpler decompositions that are often useful, which we call
reduced decompositions . Let X∈Obj(C). A reduced cone-decomposition of XinCof weight
ris a pair D= (¯D, ϕ)where ¯Dis a cone-decomposition in C∞as in (17), with all triangles ∆i
of weight 0, and with
ϕ:Yn→X
anr-isomorphism in C. The linearization of such a decomposition is by definition the lin-
earization of ¯D. We denote by w(D) :=rthe weight of D.
It is easy to see that ∆ncombined with the r-isomorphism ϕcan be used to define an exact
triangle in C∞of the form:
Xn→Yn−1→X→TXn
of weight r. Thus, if Xadmits a reduced cone-decomposition of weight rinC, then it also
admits a cone-decomposition D′inC∞with ¯wC(D′) =r.
Reduceddecompositionsaremucheasiertohandleinapplicationscomparedtogeneralones.
Moreover, it is shown in the proof of Corollary 2.86 in [12] that given any decomposition D
ofXas in (17) there exists a reduced decomposition D′ofX, of weight no more than 4w(D),
and with linearization ℓ(D′) = (Σr1X1,Σr2X2, . . . , ΣrnXn)for some ri∈R.12 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
Note that for reduced decomposition the analogous measurement to (19) does not satisfy
the triangle inequality, hence such decompositions do not seem to lead to pseudo-metrics.
However, as we will see in §8.1 reduced decompositions turn out to be useful for estimates
involving K-theoretic invariants, weights and barcodes.
2.6.Fukaya triangulated persistence categories. The notion of triangulated persistence
category is inspired, in part, by natural filtrations in Floer theory. Indeed, it is shown in [12,
Chapter 3] that the usual derived Fukaya category generated by exact, closed Lagrangians
admits a TPC refinement. In this subsection we review enough of the constructions from [12]
as is necessary for the applications in §8. We refer to this work for more details.
2.6.1.Filtered A∞categories. Before we get to the filtered framework, let us briefly describe
our general conventions regarding (unfiltered) A∞-categories.
For coherence with the rest of the algebraic parts of the paper, as well as with some of
our previous work (e.g. [8, 6, 5] and, in part, in [12]) we use here homological conventions for
A∞-categories. More specifically, this means that in our A∞-categories A, the µd-operation
has degree d−2(rather than 2−d), for all d≥1. In particular, the hom’s homA(X, Y)
between any two objects X, Y, endowed with µ1, arechaincomplexes (rather than cochain
complexes). Moreover, whenever relevant, we assume the homology units (or sometimes even
strict units) eXto be in degree 0,eX∈homA(X, X )0. Turning to the homological category
H(A)ofA, its hom’s are the homologies of the chain complexes (hom A(−,−), µ1)and the
µ2-operation induces products
Hi(hom A(X, Y))⊗Hj(hom A(Y, Z))−→Hi+j(hom A(X, Z)),
hence we obtain a graded category (which is unital in case Ais homologically unital). Some-
times we will restrict to the degree 0homological category H0(A). In case Ais homology
unital, H0(A)becomes a unital category since we have assumed our homology units eXto be
in degree 0. Later on, in §2.6.2, when dealing with Fukaya categories, we will explain how to
adjust the standard grading setting in Floer theory to fit the conventions above.
We now turn to the filtered case. A filtered A∞-category Ais an A∞-category (with the
conventions described above) over a given base field k, such that the homspaces homA(X, Y)
betweeneverytwoobjects X, Yarefiltered(withincreasingfiltrations)and allthecomposition
maps µd,d≥1, respect the filtrations. We endow homA(X, Y)with the differential µ1and
view it as a filtered chain complex. We denote by homs
A(X, Y),s∈R, the level- sfiltration
subcomplexof homA(X, Y). Wemakethreefurtherassumptionsonourfiltered A∞-categories:
(i)Ais strictly unital with the units lying in persistence level 0.
(ii) for every two objects X, Y∈Obj(A), the space homA(X, Y)is finite dimensional over
k.
(iii)Ais complete with respect to persistence shifts in the sense that we have a shift
“functor” which consists of a family of A∞-functors Σ ={Σr:A −→ A , r∈R}whose
members satisfy the following conditions:PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 13
(1)Σris strictly unital and the higher components (Σr)d,d≥2, ofΣrall vanish.
(2)Σ0=1,Σs◦Σt= Σs+t.
(3) We are given prescribed identifications homs
A(ΣrX, Y)∼=homs+r
A(X, Y)that are
compatible with the inclusions homα
A(X, Y)⊂homβ
A(X, Y)forα≤β. These
identifications are considered as part of the structure of the shift functor Σ.
Given a filtered A∞-category AletTwAbe the category of (filtered) twisted complexes over
A. This is itself a filtered A∞-category. The category Aembeds into TwAin an obvious way,
the embedding being a filtered A∞-functor which is full and faithful. Further, TwAis pre-
triangulated in the filtered sense (which in particular means that it is closed under formation
of filtered mapping cones). As a result the homological category
C′A:=H0(TwA)
is a TPC that contains the homological persistence category H0(A)ofA.
Another TPC associated to the A∞-category Ais provided by the category Fmod (A)of
filtered A∞-modules over A. We will only consider strictly unital modules here. There is
an obvious shift functor on this category Σ : (R,+)→End( Fmod (A))andFmod (A)is in
fact a filtered dg-category in the sense of [12, Chapter 2] and it is pre-triangulated. Thus
H0(Fmod (A))is a TPC. A certain subcategory of Fmod (A)will be of particular interest for
us. Because our assumption of strict unitality the Yoneda embedding is filtered:
Y:A → Fmod (A)
and, thus, there exists a filtered quasi-isomorphism
M(X)→hom Fmod(Y(X),M)
for all objects XofAandM ∈ Obj(Fmod (A)). LetA#be the triangulated closure of the
Yoneda modules and their shifts. This is a full subcategory of Fmod (A)that has as objects
all the iterated cones, over filtration preserving morphisms, of shifts of Yoneda modules (thus
of modules of the form ΣrY(X)).
Finally, let A∇the smallest full sub dg-category of Fmod (A)that contains A#and all
the modules (and all their shifts and translates) that are r-quasi-isomorphic to objects in
A#,r∈[0,∞). A module Misr-quasi-isomorphic to Nif, in H0Fmod (A), there is an
r-isomorphism M → N .
It is easy to see that A∇remains pre-triangulated, carries the shift functor induced from
Fmod (A)and thus the homological category CA:=H0(A∇)is a TPC.
There are filtered functors:
Θ :Tw(A)−→Fmod [Tw(A)]−→Fmod (A)
where the first arrow is the Yoneda embedding and the second is pullback over the natural
inclusion A → Tw(A). The composition Θis a homologically full and faithful embedding, and14 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
it induces a full and faithful embedding of TPCs. The image of Θlands inside A∇(actually
inside the category denoted by A#) and thus we have an inclusion of TPCs:
¯Θ :C′A,→ CA
which, in general, is not a TPC- equivalence (by contrast to the non-filtered case). In particu-
lar, the category CAcontains many more objects than C′A. Each object in CAisr-isomorphic
to an object in C′Abut possibly only for some r >0(to have a TPC equivalence we would
need to be able to take r= 0).
2.6.2.Filtered Fukaya categories. We work in the following setting: (X, ω =dλ)is a Liouville
manifold, i.e. an exact symplectic manifold with a prescribed primitive λof the symplectic
structure ω, and such that Xis symplectically convex at infinity with respect to these struc-
tures. The Lagrangians used here are triples L= (¯L, h L, θL)consisting of a closed oriented
exact Lagrangian submanifolds ¯L⊂Xequipped with a primitive hL:¯L−→Rofλ|¯Land a
grading θL. We refer to such a pair Las a marked Lagrangian submanifold and to ¯Las its
underlying Lagrangian.
Beforewegoon, letusdescribeouralgebraicconventionsregardingFloertheoryandFukaya
categories. First of all, unless otherwise stated, all Fukaya categories will be assumed from
now on to be over the base field k=Z2.
The standard cohomology grading convention in Floer theory is that the µd-operation has
degree 2−d, which is compatible with standard cohomology conventions of A∞-categories.
The standard homology grading convention is that the µd-operation has degree d−2 +n−
dn, where n=1
2dimXis the complex dimension of the ambient symplectic manifold X.
In particular this means that the µ2-products have degree −n, namely µ2:CFi(L0, L1)⊗
CFj(L1, L2)−→CFi+j−n(L0, L2)and the (chain level) units are in degree n,eL∈CFn(L, L).
ThisisalsothecaseinMorsehomologytheory(wheretheunitsaremaximaofMorsefunctions,
hence of degree n, and represent the fundamental class of the manifold L). Obviously this is
incompatible with the conventions described in §2.6.1. In order to adjust the Floer homology
setting to the one from §2.6.1 we perform a simple shift in grading as follows. We define:
CF′
j(L0, L1) :=CFn+j(L0, L1), HF′
j(L0, L1) :=HFn+j(L0, L1),∀j∈Z.
We now redefine the hom’s in the Fukaya category Fuk(X)such that
homFuk(X)(L0, L1)j=CF′
j(L0, L1),
and similarly for Floer the homologies HF′. With these conventions the Fukaya category
fits the conventions described in §2.6.1, namely the µdoperation has degree d−2and the
(homological) units are in degree 0. The only apparent downside of this grading adjustment
(which is purely aesthetic) is that with the standard grading, CF∗(L, L)(when endowed
with suitable auxiliary structures) is the Morse complex of LandHF∗(L, L)∼=H∗(L;Z2)
(recall that we work with exact Lagrangians). However, with the new grading CF′j(L, L)and
HF′j(L, L)are concentrated in the negative degrees −n≤j≤0, and we have HF′j(L, L)∼=
Hn+j(L;Z2). Another thing to note is that with the new grading conventions Poincaré dualityPERSISTENCE K-THEORY 15
takesthefollowingform: HF′j(L, L′)∼=HF′−n−j(L′, L)∗, wheretheasteriskinthesuperscript
stands for the dual.
We now proceed to the case of filtered Fukaya categories. Fix a collection of marked
Lagrangians XinX. We assume that Xis closed under grading translations and shifts of
the primitives in the sense that if L= (¯L, h L)is inX, then for every r∈R, and k∈Z, the
marked Lagrangian
ΣrL[k] := ( ¯L, h L+r, θL−k) (21)
is also in X. We denote by ¯Xthe family of underlying Lagrangians:
¯X={¯L|L∈ X} .
We will assume that the family ¯Xis finite and that its elements are in generic position in the
sense that any two distinct Lagrangians L′, L′′∈¯Xintersect transversely and for every three
distinct Lagrangians ¯L0,¯L1,¯L2∈¯Xwe have ¯L0∩¯L1∩¯L2=∅.
Notice that we have implicitly introduced here the shift functor Σr, and the translation
functors TkL:=L[−k]that act on the objects of Xas in (21).
InChapter3of[12]areconstructed, inthesettingabove, filtered A∞categories, Fuk(X;P),
of Fukaya type, with objects the elements of X. Here Pis a choice of perturbation data, picked
roughly by the scheme in [32], but with special care, such that the output is indeed filtered
and not only weakly filtered. This construction is delicate and the constraint that ¯Xbe
finite and in generic position is used repeatedly there. The resulting category Fuk(X;P)is
strictly unital, with a unit in filtration 0, and has also the property that homFuk(X;P)(L, L)is
concentrated in filtration 0for all L∈ X. This happens because the moduli spaces used to
defined the A∞operations appeal to “cluster” type configurations mixing Morse flow lines and
Floer type polygons such that, as a chain complex, (hom Fuk(X;P)(L, L), µ1)coincides with the
Morse complex of a Morse function fL:L→Rwhose choice is part of the data P. Moreover,
for two transverse Lagrangians L, L′the Floer data has 0-Hamiltonian term (in other works,
it satisfies the homogeneous Floer equation).
It is also shown that any two such categories, defined for two different allowable choices of
perturbation data PandP′are filtered quasi-equivalent in the sense that there are filtered
A∞-functors Fuk(X;P)→ Fuk(X;P′)that are the identity on objects and induce a (filtered)
equivalence of the homological persistence categories.
One can then apply the discussion in §2.6.1 resulting in two associated TPC’s.
The first is CFuk(X), the homological category
CFuk(X) =H0[Fuk(X;P)∇]
where Fuk(X;P)∇is the smallest triangulated - with respect to weight- 0triangles - full sub-
category of Fmod (Fuk(X;P))that contains the Yoneda modules Y(L)with L∈ Xand is
closed to r-isomorphism for all rin the sense that if j:M→M′is an r-isomorphism of mod-
ules, and M∈ Fuk(X;P)∇, then M′∈ Fuk(X;P)∇. Possibly more concretely, each object
in this category is r-isomorphic, for some r, to a weight- 0iterated cone of Yoneda modules.16 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
Two such triangulated persistence categories, defined for different choices of perturbation data
are equivalent (as TPCs) and thus we drop the reference to the perturbation data from the
notation.
The second type of TPC, C′Fuk(X), is defined by
C′Fuk(X) =H0[Tw(Fuk(X;P))]
where Tw(Fuk(X;P))isthecategoryoffilteredtwistedcomplexesconstructedfrom Fuk(X;P).
Any two choices of perturbation data produce equivalent TPCs, and we again drop Pfrom
the notation. There are filtered functors:
Θ :Tw(Fuk(X;P))−→Fmod [Tw(Fuk(X;P))]−→Fmod (Fuk(X;P))
and a comparison functor:
¯Θ :C′Fuk(X),→ CF uk(X).
Of course, there are also unfiltered categories here as the marked Lagrangians in Xare
the objects of an A∞-category, the Fukaya category Fuk(X)ofX, constructed as in Seidel’s
book [32]. In case of risk of confusion we denote this category by Fukun(X)to indicate that
filtrations are neglected in this case, and we use this convention for the other structures in
use, such as A∞modules and so forth. Similarly, we have the category Fukun(X)that has
as objects only the elements of X, as well as the respective derived versions DFuk(X), and
DFukun(X).
The basic relation between the filtered and unfiltered versions is that there are equivalences
of triangulated categories
[C′Fuk(X))]∞∼=[CFuk(X)]∞∼=DFukun(X).
Given that C′Fuk(X), andCFuk(X)are TPC’s, their sets of objects can be endowed with
fragmentation pseudo-metrics of the type dF, as in §2.5, for any choice of objects F.
3.General properties of the K-group of a TPC
The purpose of this section is to describe several basic properties of the K-group of a TPC.
In the whole section we fix a TPC denoted by C. Its 0-level category C0has the same objects
asCbut has as morphisms only the 0-level morphisms in C,homC0(A, B) = hom0
C(A, B).
The group we are most interested in is K(C0), the Grothendieck group of the category C0
which, by the definition of a TPC, is triangulated. We refer to this group as the K-group of
Cand denote it by K(C). Note that K(C)has a natural structure of a ΛP-module by defining
tr·[A] = [ΣrA]for every r∈R.
We start in §3.1 with some remarks on acyclics. Subsection 3.2 shows how TPC functors -
properly defined - induce morphisms at the K-group level. In §3.3 we discuss a ring structure
on the K-group which is defined in case the TPC admits a tensor structure - we call such a
TPC monoidal. In §3.4 we discuss the opposite category of a TPC and its K-group. In §3.5PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 17
we consider the ∞-level of a TPC and the associated K-group. We package most of these
properties in Theorem 3.6.1 in §3.6.
3.1.The acyclic category of a TPC. LetCbe a TPC. An important feature of a TPC
is that there is a class of objects that are “close to 0” in a quantifiable way. Explicitly, recall
that an object X∈Obj(C)isr-acyclicforr≥0, denoted by X≃r0, if1X≃r0(see §2.4,
and for more details [12]).
As mentioned in §2.4, there are two (sub)categories.
(i) The full subcategory of C, denoted by AC, whose objects are r-acyclic for any r≥0.
(ii) The full subcategory of C0, denoted by AC0, whose objects are r-acyclic for any r≥0.
The subcategory ACis obviously a persistence category, since homAC= hom Cwhich admits
a persistence module structure. Moreover, for X, Y∈Obj((AC)0) = Obj( AC) = Obj( AC0),
we have
hom (AC)0(X, Y) = hom0
AC(X, Y) = hom AC0(X, Y).
This yields (AC)0=AC0. Moreover, the subcategory ACis a TPC and the category C∞is
the Verdier localization of C0with respect to AC0(for more details, see [12]). Thus, the K-
group K(AC)ofACis well-defined. Note that similarly to K(C)the group K(AC)also has
the structure of a ΛP-module by defining tr·[A] = [ΣrA].
The two K-groups K(C)andK(AC)are closely related. First, there is an obvious homo-
morphism,
j:K(AC)→K(C)defined by X7→X. (22)
This is well-defined since an exact triangle in AC0is also an exact triangle in C0.
Additionally (and non-trivially), we also have morphisms in the opposite direction, called
acyclic truncations , defined as follows. For any fixed r≥0and for any X∈Obj(C), by (iv)
in §2.4, we have an exact triangle
ΣrXηX
r− →X→Qr,X→TΣrX (23)
inC0for some r-acyclic object Qr,X∈Obj(AC0). Consider the following map
Qr:K(C)→K(AC)defined by X7→Qr(X) :=Qr,X. (24)
Note that since Qr,Xisr-acyclic and defined up to isomorphism in C0, we know that Qr,X(or
more precisely the class [Qr,X]) is a well-defined element in K(AC).
Lemma 3.1.1. The map Qrdefined in (24) is well-defined, and it is a homomorphism.
Proof.For the first conclusion, we need to prove that if Xis replaced by Y−ZinK(C), that
is,X=Y−Z, then Qr(X) =Qr(Y)−Qr(Z)inK(AC). By the defining relations in the
corresponding K-groups, this means that the existence of the exact triangle Xf− →Y→Z→
TXinC0implies that the triangle defined below
Qr,X→Qr,Y→Qr,Z→TQr,X (25)18 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
is also exact in AC0, where Qr,X, Qr,Y, and Qr,Zare the r-acyclic objects from the exact
triangles in the form of (23). In fact, by (iii) in §2.4, we have an exact triangle ΣrXΣrf− − →
ΣrY→ΣrZ→TΣrX. Then consider the following diagram,

We know that ηY

rand the first two rows and first two columns are all exact
triangles. Then by 3×3-lemma (see Proposition 1.1.11 in [3]), there exists an object A∈
Obj(C)(infact, A∈Obj(AC))anddashedarrowssuchthatalltherowsandcolumnsareexact,
as well as the diagram commutes (except the most right-bottom square is anti-commutative).
In particular, we have an exact triangle
Qr,X→Qr,Y→A→TQr,X,
as the third row in the diagram. Moreover, since the third column ΣrZ→Z→A→TΣrZ
is also exact, we have A∼=Qr,Z. Hence, we obtain the exact triangle (25).
To see that Qris a homomorphism, we need to show that Qr(X+Y) =Qr(X) +Qr(Y). In
theK-group, the sum X+Yis represented by an object Z∈Obj(C)that fits into an exact
triangle X→Z→Y→TX. Then the same argument as in the first part shows that there
is an exact triangle Qr,X→Qr,Z→Qr,Y→TQr,X. Therefore,
Qr(X+Y) =Qr(Z) =Qr,Z
=Qr,X+Qr,Y=Qr(X) +Qr(Y)
inK(AC0). Similarly, we have Qr(−X) =Qr,TX=TQr,X=−Qr,XinK(AC0). □
3.2.TPC functors and induced K-morphisms. We formalize here some of the construc-
tions before in a more abstract fashion. We denote a TPC by a triple (C, TC,ΣC)(or(C, T,Σ))
to emphasize the role of the shift functor Σand that of the translation functor TinC. Let us
recall the following definition (see Definition 2.25 in [12]).
Definition3.2.1. Let(C, TC,ΣC)and(D, TD,ΣD)beTPCs. A TPC functor F: (C, TC,ΣC)→
(D, TD,ΣD)is a persistence functor satisfying the following conditions.PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 19
(i) For any r∈R, we have Σr
D◦ F=F ◦Σr
C. Moreover, for any r, s∈R, we have the
following commutative diagram,

for any X∈Obj(C).
(ii) The restriction F|C0:C0→ D 0is a triangulated functor (recall that by definition of a
TPC, the 0-level categories C0andD0are genuine triangulated categories).
Here are some useful properties of TPC functors.
Lemma 3.2.2. LetF: (C, TC,ΣC)→(D, TD,ΣD)be a TPC functor. Then we have the
following properties.
(i) For any X∈Obj(C)andr≥0, we have F(ηX
r) =ηF(X)
r.
(ii) If X∈Obj(C)isr-acyclic, then F(X)is also r-acyclic.
(iii) If ϕ:X→Yis an r-isomorphism, then F(ϕ) :F(X)→ F (Y)is an r-isomorphism
too.
(iv) If ∆ :A¯u− →B¯v− →C¯w− →Σ−rTAis a strict exact triangle of weight r≥0, then
F(∆) :F(A)F(¯u)− − → F (B)F(¯v)− − → F (C)F( ¯w)− − − → Σ−rTF(A)
is also a strict exact triangle of weight r.
(v)Fdescends to a group homomorphism FK:K(C)→K(D). The same conclusion
holds for K(AC)andK(AD)as well as for K∞(C)andK∞(D).
Proof.The proof is rather straightforward so we only outline the main points. Indeed, the
fact that the restriction of FtoC0is triangulated and that Fis a persistence functor that
commutes with the shift functors and the natural transformations ηimplies easily that F
sends r-acyclics to r-acyclics. One then deduces that Ftransforms r-isomorphisms into r-
isomorphisms and the rest of the properties stated are easy to check. □
Given any TPC (C, TC,ΣC), recall that K(C)andK(AC)are related by the group homo-
morphisms Qrdefined in (24) and jdefined in (22). It is easy to see that we also have:
Lemma 3.2.3. For any TPC (C, TC,ΣC), we have the following relations,
j◦ FK=FK◦jand Qr◦ FK=FK◦Qr
for any r≥0.
To summarize what we have shown till now, triangulated persistence categories together
with TPC functors form a category denoted by TPC. There is an acyclicfunctor
A:TPC−→ T PC , C 7−→ AC.20 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
The morphisms jandQrcan be viewed as appropriate natural transformations relating the
functor Ato the identity.
Recall from the beginning of §3 that for a TPC CtheK-group K(C)has the structure of
ΛP-module defined by tr·[A] = [ΣrA]. Consider the category of modules mod ΛPover ΛP.
With these conventions we have constructed two Grothendieck group functors:
K:TPC−→mod ΛP (26)
that associates to a TPC CitsK-group K(C)and to a TPC functor Fthe induced morphism
FKand
KA:TPC−→mod ΛP (27)
that is defined by KA=K◦Aand associates to Cthe module K(AC). We will often denote
this module by KA(C)from now on.
3.3.Monoidal structures on Cand ring structures on K(C).We start here with a
natural generalization of the notion of tensor category (or monoidal category, see Section 1 in
Chapter VII of [25]) to the TPC setting.
Definition 3.3.1. LetCbe a TPC. A tensor structure onCis an associative symmetric bi-
operator ⊗: Obj( C)×Obj(C)→Obj(C)together with a unit element eC∈Obj(C)(with
respect to ⊗) such that the following axioms are satisfied.
(i) For any A∈Obj(C), we have (−)⊗Ais a persistence functor on C. Explicitly, for any
X, Y∈Obj(C)andf∈homα
C(X, Y)forα∈R,
((−)⊗A)(X) =X⊗Aand ((−)⊗A)(f) =f⊗1A∈homα
C(X⊗A, Y⊗A).
(ii) For any A∈Obj(C), the restriction of the functor (−)⊗AtoC0is triangulated, i.e.,
it maps exact triangles in C0to exact triangles in C0. Moreover, (−)⊗Ais additive
onC0.
(iii) For any A∈Obj(C), the functor (−)⊗Ais compatible with the translation auto-
equivalence Tand the shift functor Σrfor any r∈Rin the following sense,
TX⊗A∼=T(X⊗A)(∼=X⊗TA)inC0,
and there exists a family of isomorphisms {θr: ΣrX⊗A→Σr(X⊗A)}r∈RinC0with

Remark 3.3.3.Recall that ACis the subcategory of Cwhose objects consists of only acyclic
objects. It is a simple exercise to check that any A∈Obj(C), the functor (−)⊗Arestrict to
an endofunctor of AC.
Example 3.3.4.A basic example of a monoidal TPC’s is the persistence homotopy category
Cfg=H0(FChfg)offinitelygeneratedfilteredchaincomplexes. Thetensorstructureisinduced
by tensor products of (filtered) chain complexes and the unit element is given by the chain
complex E=k⟨x⟩which is concentrated in degree 0, has ∂x= 0and whose filtration function
ℓis defined by ℓ(x) = 0.
In the same vein, the persistence homotopy category Ct=H0(FCht)of tame filtered chain
complexes (see page 6) is a monoidal TPC too.
Suppose that Cis monoidal. For X, Y∈Obj(C)with classes [X],[Y]∈K(C)define
[X]·[Y] = [X⊗Y]∈K(C). (28)
Lemma 3.3.5. IfCadmits a tensor structure, then the operation in (28)is well-defined and
induces a commutative unital ring structure on K(C)and a non-unital one on K(AC). The
same operation makes K(AC)into a K(C)-module, and the map (22)isK(C)-linear.
The proof can be found in the expanded version of the paper [10].
Remark3.3.6.Recallthat K(C)isalsoa ΛP-module. Thismodulestructureiscompatiblewith
the preceding ring structure (defined when Cis monoidal) and together these two structures
make K(C)into an algebra over ΛP. A similar statement holds for KA(C).
3.4.The opposite TPC and its K-group. Recall that every triangulated category Chas
its opposite category denoted by Copwhich is triangulated as well. The exact triangles in Cop
are related to those of Cas follows (we follow the construction given by Remark 10.1.10 (ii)
in [21]). Denote by op :C −→ Copthe canonical (contravariant) functor that (i) is identity on
Obj(C)(= Obj( Cop))and (ii) reverses the domain and target on the morphisms in C, that is,
op(f)∈Hom Cop(Y, X)ifff∈Hom C(X, Y). Assume that Tis the translation autoequivalence
ofC, then define
Top:= op◦T−1◦op−1:Cop→ Cop(29)22 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
to be the translation autoequivalence in Cop. An exact triangle in Copis defined by
Zop(g)− − − → Yop(f)− − − → Xop(−T−1(h))− − − − − − − → TopZ (30)
whenever Xf− →Yg− →Zh− →TXis an exact triangle in C. It is easy to see that Copis a
triangulated category.
Definition 3.4.1. Let(C, T,Σ)be a TPC. Define its opposite by(Cop, Top,Σop)where Topis
defined in (29) and
(Σop)r:= op◦Σ−r◦op−1:Cop→ Cop(31)
for every r∈R. Moreover, the persistence module structure on the homC’s induces in an
obvious way such a structure on the homCop’s. This makes Copinto a persistence category and
the canonical functor opis a (contravariant) persistence functor. Moreover, as we will see in
Lemma 3.4.3 and 3.4.4 below, (Cop, Top,Σop)defined as above is a TPC and the functor op is
a TPC functor.
A few remarks are in order.
Remark 3.4.2.(i) The collection Σop={(Σop)r}r∈Rforms a shift functor on Cop, and the
natural transformation ηop
r,s: (Σop)r→(Σop)sis defined by
ηop
r,s:= op( η−s,−r) (32)
for any r, s∈R, where η−s,−r: Σ−s→Σ−ris the natural transformation for Σ.
(ii) Recall that for each object XinC, the morphism ηX
r=ι−r,0(ηr,0(X))∈hom0
C(ΣrX, X )
plays an important role in the definition of a TPC. Similarly in Cop, the counterpart is
(ηop)X
r=ι−r,0(ηop
r,0(X)) =i−r,0(op(η0,−r(X)))
= op( ηX
r)∈hom0
Cop((Σop)rX, X )
where in the third equality we use the condition that opis a persistence functor,
commuting with the persistence structure morphisms.
(iii) The 0-level category of Copsatisfies (Cop)0= (C0)op, since the canonical map opis a
persistence functor.
Lemma 3.4.3. Let(C, T,Σ)be a TPC, then its opposite (Cop, Top,Σop)is also a TPC.
We refer the reader to the expanded version of this paper [10] for the proof.
For brevity, denote by Cop
0the0-level category of Cop(there is no ambiguity of the notation
due to (iii) in Remark 3.4.2).
Lemma 3.4.4. The canonical functor op : ( C, T,Σ)→(Cop, Top,Σop)is a TPC functor.
Moreover, it induces a group isomorphism opK:K(C)→K(Cop).
The proof is straightforward and can be found in [10].PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 23
3.5.The∞-level of a TPC and an exact sequence. Recall from §2.4, page 9, that for ev-
ery TPC Cwe can associate its ∞-level category C∞with homC∞(A, B) = lim −→homα
C(A, B).
As mentioned in §2.4, this category is identified with the Verdier localization of C0/AC0. Thus
C∞is triangulated (see [12, Proposition 2.38]) and its K-group K(C∞)is well-defined. The
exact triangles of C∞contain those of C0and it is easy to see that many of the properties of
K(C)remain true for K(C∞):
(i)K(C∞)is aΛP-module. If Cis monoidal, then K(C∞)is aΛP-algebra.
(ii) There is a functor K∞:TPC−→mod ΛPdefined by C 7−→ K∞(C) :=K(C∞).
Here (as in §3.2) mod ΛPdenotes the category of modules over ΛP.
We will now relate the groups K(C)andK(C∞)via an exact sequence. Of course, this rela-
tion is to be expected given that C∞=C0/AC0. Note that there is a surjective homomorphism
π:K(C)−→K∞(C)ofΛP-modules which is induced by the identity on objects. Further,
the inclusion Obj (AC)⊂Obj(C)gives rise to a well defined map j:KA(C)j−→K(C). Let
TorK(C) := ker( j)and denote by ψ:TorK(C)−→KA(C)the inclusion. Thus we have the
following sequence of ΛP-modules:
0−→TorK(C)ψ−→KA(C)j−→K(C)π−→K∞(C)−→0. (33)
From the general properties of Verdier localization it is easy to deduce the following property.
Proposition 3.5.1. The sequence (33)is exact.
Remark 3.5.2.(a) As mentioned before, this follows from the general properties of Verdier
localization but it is useful to have a more explicit description of Tor K(C)together with the
exactnessargumentandweprovidethemhere. Considerthefollowingdiagramof ΛP-modules.

The diagram is constructed as follows. We denote by G⟨−⟩the free abelian group generated
by the objects of the respective categories and by R−the subgroup of triangular relations
associated to the triangular structure of the 0-level of the respective TPC, as in the definition
of the K-group. Thus, by the definition of the Kgroups in question, the first two columns
are exact. The maps ¯jand¯j′are inclusions and jis induced by them. The groups G∞and
R∞are defined as the obvious quotients making the top two rows exact and π,π′are the
projections. The maps uis induced from the left, top square in the diagram. The group bRC
is the kernel of u. All the groups and morphisms discussed here are also ΛP-modules so bRC
is also a ΛP-module. It is immediate to see that π◦j= 0because an acyclic object is, by
definition, r-isomorphic to 0for some r∈R, and thus it is isomorphic to 0inC∞. This means
that the map vis well-defined and induced by the left bottom square in the diagram.
Diagram chasing shows that the exactness in the proposition follows by proving that vis
surjective and, moreover, this implies that the kernel of jis identified to bRC,
TorK(C) = ker( j) =bRC.
Given that K∞(C) =G⟨C⟩/RC∞, the surjectivity of vcomes down to the following identity
RC∞=G⟨AC⟩+RC0 (35)
which follows from the description of the exact triangles in C∞.
(b) It is useful to express the group Tor K(C) =bRCin yet a different way. Notice that we
have the obvious inclusion:
RAC0,→G⟨AC⟩ ∩ R C0.
More diagram chasing shows that:
TorK(C) = [G⟨AC⟩ ∩ R C0]/RAC0. (36)
(c) It is easy to see that Tor K(C)can be viewed as a functor:
TorK:TPC−→mod ΛP
and that ψ:TorK(C)−→KA(C)from (33) is part of a natural transformation between Tor K
andAK.
3.6.Wrap-up of general properties. We assemble here the properties discussed above in
one statement, by expanding on the discussion in §3.2. Recall from §3.2 that mod ΛPis the
category of modules over ΛP. Denote by op :mod ΛP→modop
ΛPthe obvious opfunctor with
the particular feature that op(M) =Mwhere Mis the same abelian group as Mbut the
ΛP-module structure is tr·a=t−r·awhere a∈Mandais the corresponding element in M.
Recall from §3.2 that we denote by TPCthe category of TPCs and TPC functors.
Theorem 3.6.1. There are four functors: K, KA, K∞,TorK:TPC→mod ΛPthat are
defined on objects by
K(C) :=K(C0), KA(C) :=K(AC0), K∞(C) :=K(C∞),TorK(C) := [ G⟨AC⟩ ∩ R C0]/RAC0PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 25
(see (36) for TorK), and correspondingly on morphisms. There are natural transformations
relating K,KA,K∞, andTorKinduced by the maps j,Qrfrom §3.1, and πandψfrom §3.5
and the four functors fit into exact sequences as in (33):
0→TorKψ−→KAj−→Kπ−→K∞→0. (37)
The four functors TorK,KA,K,K∞commute with the opfunctors in the domain and
target. Moreover, when restricted to the subcategory of TPCconsisting of monoidal TPCs
and functors, they take values in the category of algebras over ΛP.
4.Filtered chain complexes
In this section, we will carry on explicit computations of the K-group when C=H0(FCh),
the homotopy category of filtered chain complexes over k, and make explicit several properties
from §3 in this setting.
4.1.Main computational result. We refer to [35] for the general background on the al-
gebraic structures related to this category. We recall below some notation, definitions and
results.
We denote by FChthe category of filtered chain complexes. As explained in [11, Sec-
tion 6.2], FChhas the structure of a filtered dg-category which is pre-triangulated, therefore
its degree-0 homology category denoted by H0(FCh)is a TPC (see [11, Proposition 6.1.12]).
Given a filtered chain complex (C∗, ∂, ℓ)there exists a decomposition, unique up to filtered
chain isomorphism (see the work of Barannikov [2]; See also Proposition 7.4 in [35]),
(C∗, ∂, ℓ)∼=M
k∈ZC(k)[−k]where C(k)=rkM
i=1E1(ai)⊕skM
i=1E2(bi, ci). (38)
Here, E1(a)andE2(b, c)denote the following two elementary filtered chain complexes serving
as the building blocks of the decomposition:
-E1(a) = ((··· → 0→kx→0→ ··· ), ℓ(x) =a),deg(x) = 0;
-E2(b, c) = (( ··· → 0→ky∂− →kx→0→ ··· ), ℓ(x) =b, ℓ(y) =c),deg(x) = 0,
deg(y) = 1.
In what follows we will concentrate on two full subcategories of FCh(see also §2.2).
(fg) (Finitely generated chain complexes). The full subcategory FChfg⊂FChwhose
objects are filtered chain complexes (C∗, ∂, ℓ)for which the total space ⊕k∈ZCkis finite
dimensional over k.
(t) (Tame chain complexes). The full subcategory FCht⊂FChwhose objects are filtered
chain complexes (C∗, ∂, ℓ)such that for every filtration level r∈R, the truncated chain
complex (C≤r
∗, ∂)is finite dimensional over k(again, when taking all degrees together)
and, for sufficiently small r, we have C≤r
∗= 0.26 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
As we will see below, there are significant differences between the computational results of
K(H0(FChfg))andK(H0(FCht)).
The TPC H0(FCh)is monoidal in the sense of Definition 3.3.1. The bi-operator ⊗is
defined by the classical tensor product of two chain complexes, that is, for C= (C∗, ∂C, ℓC)
andD= (D∗, ∂D, ℓD), we have
C⊗D= ((C⊗D)∗, ∂C⊗D, ℓC⊗D)
where (C⊗D)k=L
p+q=kCp⊗Dq, and (∂C⊗D)k=P
p+q=k((∂C)p⊗1D+ (−1)p(1C⊗(∂D)q)).
Moreover, ℓC⊗D=ℓC+ℓD. Then, clearly this ⊗is associative and symmetric. The unity eis
given by the filtered chain complex,
E1(0) = ( ··· → 0→kx→0→ ··· , ∂= 0,deg(x) = 0 ℓ(x) = 0) .
The fact that eis a unit follows from Example 4.1.1 below. Most of the other axioms in
Definition 3.3.1 are readily verified. For instance, the family of isomorphisms {θr}r∈Rin the
axiom (iii) are in fact all identities. Indeed, by definition, Σr(C∗, ∂, ℓ) = (C∗, ∂C, ℓC+r), so
(ΣrC)⊗D= Σr(C⊗D) = (( C⊗D)∗, ∂C⊗D, ℓC⊗D+r).
The only non-trivial part is the verification that (−)⊗C∗is a triangulated functor on
H0(FCh)0. This follows from Lemma 15.58.2 in [30].
Example 4.1.1 (Example2.8in[29]orProposition9.2in[36]) .Forlateruse, thisexamplecom-
putes the tensor product of elementary filtered complexes that appear in the decomposition
(38). There are three cases:
-E1(a)⊗E1(b) =E1(a+b).
-E1(a)⊗E2(b, c) =E2(a+b, a+c).
-E2(a, b)⊗E2(c, d) =E2(a+c,min{a+d, b+c})⊕E2(max{a+d, b+c}, b+d)[−1].
We emphasize that in the last case, there is a degree shift in the second term.
It is straightforwards to verify that the above tensor structure restricts to tensor structures
onH0(FChfg)andH0(FCht). We denote Ct=H0(FCht)andCfg=H0(FChfg).
The various computations of K-groups for these two categories are collected in the next
theorem. Recall the Novikov rings ΛandΛPfrom §2.1.
Theorem 4.1.2. The tensor product of filtered chain complexes induces ring structures on
K(Ct)andK(Cfg). Moreover:
(1) there exists a canonical isomorphism of rings
λ:K(Ct)−→Λ, (39)
uniquely defined by the property that λ([E1(a)]) = tafor every a∈R, where E1(a)is
as above and [−]∈K(Ct)is the K-class of the relevant filtered chain complex.PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 27
(2) Denote by ifg:K(Cfg)−→K(Ct)the map induced by the inclusion Cfg
0⊂ Ct
0. Then the
composition λ◦ifg:K(Cfg)−→Λhas values in ΛPand is an isomorphism of rings
K(Cfg)∼=ΛP.
(3) Denote by ACfgthe homotopy category of acyclic finitely generated filtered chain com-
plexes and by jK:K(ACfg)−→K(Cfg)the map induced by the inclusion ACfg
0⊂ Cfg
0.
Then the composition λ◦jKhas values in the ideal Λ(0)
P={P(t)∈ΛP|P(1) = 0 } ⊂ΛP
and gives an isomorphism K(ACfg)∼=Λ(0)
Pwhich is compatible with K(ACfg)being a
K(Cfg)-module and Λ(0)
Pbeing a ΛP-module.
Remark 4.1.3.(1) An older result of Kashiwara [20] establishes a similar isomorphism to
the ones described at points (1) and (2) of Theorem 4.1.2 but in the framework of
the derived category of constructible sheaves on manifolds. The analogy to the result
of Kashiwara becomes more transparent in view of the identification of Novikov rings
with rings of step functions as described in §5.
Another related result appears in [14], where the K-group of the category of multi-
parameter persistence modules is calculated. Note that the framework in that paper
is slightly different than ours - the category of persistence modules is exactwhile the
homotopy categories H0(FChfg),H0(FCht)of filtered chain complexes are TPC’s.
(2) The morphism λ:K(Ct)→Λfits with the map λ(−)defined in §2.3 for persistence
modules and their barcodes. The relation is that λ(C) =λH(C)for each filtered chain
complex C, where H(C)is the persistence homology of C.
The proof of the theorem will occupy the next two subsections. Explicitly, §4.2 is concerned
withCfgand §4.3 with Ct. The combination of the results in these two subsections cover all the
claims made in Theorem 4.1.2. In §4.4 we discuss some other relations involving the acyclics
for these categories. They are relevant to understand some K-theoretic aspects, as in Remark
4.4.4 (a).
4.2.Computation of the K-groups associated to H0(FChfg).Throughout this subsec-
tion we write Cfg:=H0(FChfg)for the homotopy category of finitely generated filtered chain
complexes over k. By a slight abuse of notation we will denote the K-class of a filtered chain
complex Asometimes by [A]but occasionally also simply by A.
Lemma 4.2.1. InK(Cfg), we have E2(a, b) =E1(a)−E1(b)for any a≤b∈R.
Proof.The mapping cone of the (filtration preserving) map ϕ:E1(b)→E1(a)defined by
ϕ(xb) =xaisE2(a, b), where xbandxaare the generators with the prescribed filtrations
ofE1(b)andE1(a)respectively. Thus, by the definition of the K-group, we have E1(a) =
E1(b) +E2(a, b)inK(Cfg). □
Recall that ΛPdenotes the ring of Novikov polynomials with coefficients in Z, namely finite
sums of monomials of the form ntawith n∈Z,a∈Rand where tis a formal variable. More28 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
precisely:
ΛP:=(NX
k=0nktakN∈Z≥0, nk∈Z, ak∈R)
. (40)
We endow ΛPwith the obvious ring structure whose unit is 1 = 1 ·t0. As explained at the
end of §4.1, since Cfgis monoidal, Lemma 3.3.5 implies that the K-group K(Cfg)admits a
well-defined ring structure, where the product is given by
E1(a)·E1(b) =E1(a+b), (41)
due to (28) and Example 4.1.1. Note that by Lemma 4.2.1 we only need to consider classes
inK(Cfg)represented by the elementary filtered chain complexes of E1-type. Moreover, the
unit of K(Cfg)isE1(0).
Proposition 4.2.2. There is a ring isomorphism η: ΛP∼=− − → K(Cfg)that sends ta∈ΛPto
theK-class [E1(a)]∈K(C)for every a∈R.
Proof.According to (38), any object in Cfg
0is isomorphic to a chain complex of the following
form
C=k1M
k=k0C(k)[−k]where C(k)=rkM
i=1E1(ai)⊕skM
i=1E2(bi, ci). (42)
Since the objects of Cfgare all finitely generated chain complexes, we have that k0,k1,rkand
skare all finite. Therefore, the class [C]∈K(Cfg)of such a complex is of the following form
(recall that the degree shift [−1]of a chain complex corresponds to multiplying by −1in the
K-group)
[C] =k1X
k=k0(−1)−k rkX
i=1[E1(ai)] +skX
i=1[E2(bi, ci)]!
.
By Lemma 4.2.1, and by grouping terms, the expression above can be further simplified to:
[C] =kX
i=1ni[E1(xi)]for some xi∈Randni∈Z, (43)
with kfinite and such that each xionly appears once in the sum. We may also assume that
thexi’s are written in increasing filtration order.
In summary, each element in K(Cfg)can be written in the form (43). We claim that the
representation of [C]as written in (43) is unique. This is equivalent to showing that if for a
filtered complex Cwe have [C] = 0∈K(Cfg), then the expression (43) associated to Cdoes
not contain any terms on the right hand side. The argument is based on the filtered Euler
characteristics defined by
χα(C) =χ(C≤α), α∈R. (44)PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 29
These Euler characteristics χαdescend to morphisms χα:K(Cfg)→Zdue to the standard
behavior of the Euler characteristic on short exact sequences of complexes. Additionally, it is
immediate to see that
χαkX
i=1ni[E1(xi)]
= 0,∀α∈R,iffni= 0∀i,
which shows our claim.
What we have proved so far apriori holds only for Kclasses of the form [C]with C∈
Obj(Cfg). However, every element X∈K(Cfg)is of that form, i.e. X= [C]for some finitely
generated filtered chain complex C. This is because Obj (Cfg)is closed under direct sums (and
shifts in grading). Therefore the preceding statements in fact hold for all elements of K(Cfg).
In the rest of the proof we continue to represent every element of K(Cfg)by an object of Cfg.
Consider the map
η: ΛP→K(Cfg)defined by ta7→E1(a) (45)
and extend it linearly (over Z) toΛP. We claim that ηis surjective. Indeed, for any g∈K(Cfg)
written as on the right side of (43), consider the Novikov polynomial p=Pk
i=1nitxi. We then
have η(p) =g. Next, we claim that ηis injective. This is an immediate consequence of the
fact that the writing (43) of an element in K(Cfg)is unique.
Finally, ηis a ring homomorphism. Indeed, η(1) = η(t0) =E1(0) = e, the unit, and

where the second equality comes from the product structure on K(Cfg)defined in (41). □
We denote by
λ:=η−1:K(Cfg)→ΛP (46)
the inverse of the isomorphism ηfrom Proposition 4.2.2. We have λ(E1(a)) =tafor all a∈R.
We now turn to the category of acyclics ACfgand its associated K-group KA(Cfg) =
K(ACfg
0)that was introduced in §3.1. Note that, unlike for K(Cfg), the generators of KA(Cfg)
are all of the form of E2(a, b)and the relation in Lemma 4.2.1 does not hold anymore in
KA(Cfg). Still, we have the following analogous useful result.
Lemma 4.2.3. For any a≤b≤c∈R, we have E2(a, b) +E2(b, c) =E2(a, c)inKA(Cfg).
Proof.Supposethatthegeneratorsof E2(a, c)arey0andy1satisfying ∂(y1) =y0andfiltrations
ℓ(y0) =a,ℓ(y1) =c. Similarly, suppose that the generators of E2(b, c)arex0andx1satisfying
∂(x1) =x0and filtrations ℓ(x0) =b,ℓ(x1) =c. Then consider a filtration preserving map
ϕ:E2(b, c)→E2(a, c)defined by
ϕ(x0) =y0and ϕ(x1) =y1.30 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
We have Cone( ϕ) =E2(a, b). In other words, we have an exact triangle
E2(b, c)ϕ− →E2(a, c)→E2(a, b)→E2(b, c)[−1]
and thus E2(a, c) =E2(a, b) +E2(b, c)inKA(Cfg). □
Similarly to (40), we introduce the following (non-unital) ring Λ′
Pof “double-exponent”
Novikov polynomials (in the formal variable s). Additively it is defined as:
Λ′
P:=(X
knksak,bknk∈Z, ak< bk<∞)
R, (47)
where the sums above are assumed to be finite. The relation subgroup Ris generated by the
elements {sa,b+sb,c−sa,c}for any a < b < c ∈R. The product on Λ′
Pgoes as follows,
sa,b·sc,d:=sa+c,a+d−sb+c,b+d=sa+c,b+c−sa+d,b+d(48)
and extended by linearity over Z. Note that this is well-defined and the second equality comes
from the relation R. It is easy to verify that the product defined in (48) is associative and
distributive.
The tensor structure on Cfgdescends to a well-defined (non-unital) tensor structure on ACfg,
therefore, Lemma 3.3.5 implies that the K-group KA(Cfg)admits a well-defined (non-unital)
ring structure, where the product is given by
E2(a, b)·E2(c, d) =E2(a+c,min{a+d, b+c})−E2(max{a+d, b+c}, b+d)
=E2(a+c, a+d)−E2(b+c, b+d).
HerethefirstequalitycomesfromExample4.1.1andthesecondequalitycomesfromLemma4.2.3.
Indeed, if b+c < a +d, then
E2(a+c, b+c)−E2(a+d, b+d) = (E2(a+c, b+c) +E2(b+c, a+d))
−(E2(b+c, a+d) +E2(a+d, b+d))
=E2(a+c, a+d)−E2(b+c, b+d).
Similarly, one can also write
E2(a, b)·E2(c, d) =E2(a+c, b+c)−E2(a+d, b+d). (49)
The expression in (49) explains the relations in Rlisted above.
Proposition 4.2.4. There is a multiplicative isomorphism KA(Cfg)∼=Λ′
Pthat sends the
K-class E2(a, b)∈KA(Cfg)tosa,b∈Λ′
P, for every a < b.
For the proof of Proposition 4.2.4 it is useful to relate ΛPtoΛ′
P. Consider the following
ideal of ΛP,
Λ(0)
P:={p(t)∈ΛP|p(1) = 0 }. (50)
The condition p(1) = 0is equivalent to the condition that the sum of all coefficients of the
Novikov polynomial pis equal to 0.PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 31
Lemma 4.2.5. Consider the map
σ: Λ′
P→Λ(0)
Pdefined by sa,b7→ta−tb(51)
and extend it to Λ′
Pby linearity over Z. Then σis well-defined and is a non-unital ring
isomorphism.
The proof of the Lemma can be found in the expanded version of the paper [10]. We are
now ready to prove Proposition 4.2.4.

where χ:K(Cfg)→Zis the Euler characteristic. Note that χis well defined for all ob-
jects of Cfgsince they are assumed to be finitely generated. By the same argument as in

4.3.Computation of the K-groups associated to H0(FCht).We are now interested in
the triangulated persistence category Ct:=H0(FCht)of tamed filtered chain complexes over
k(see page 25) and its K-theory.
The computations of K(Ct)andKA(Ct)partially overlap with the ones for H0(FChfg), but
they differ at some points. Instead of ΛPandΛ′

R (57)
where the relation subgroup Ris defined as in (47).
Here is the analogue of Proposition 4.2.2 in this setting.
Proposition 4.3.1. There is a ring isomorphism K(Ct)∼=Λthat sends the K-class E1(a)∈
K(Ct)tota∈Λfor every a∈R.
The proof follows from arguments almost identical to those in Proposition 4.2.2. Additional
care is required when comparing two elements in Λthat possibly involve infinitely many
monomials. We can reduce this to the polynomial situation via a truncation at a filtration
level, due to the definition of tame chain complexes.
We also have the following result, analogous to Proposition 4.2.4. We omit its proof which
can be found in [10].
Proposition 4.3.2. There is a multiplicative isomorphism KA(Ct)∼=Λ′that sends the K-
class E2(a, b)∈KA(Ct)tosa,b∈Λ′, for every a < b. Moreover, there is a multiplicative
isomorphism Λ′∼=Λ.
We continue to denote by λthe inverses of the maps ηandη′before, as in (46).
Remark 4.3.3.The map
j:KA(Ct)→K(Ct)
is an isomorphism. This follows from diagram (63) in [10]. It can also be seen in a more direct
way by first noticing that the unit e=E1(0)ofK(Ct)belongs to KA(Ct). Indeed, consider
the element
e′=∞X
k=0E2(k, k+ 1)∈KA(Ct).
This element is a unit in KA(Ct)as shown by the next computation. Fix some E2(a, b)and
write:
E2(a, b)·e′=E2(a, b)·(E2(0,1)⊕E2(1,2)⊕ ··· )
= (E2(a, b)−E2(a+ 1, b+ 1)) + ( E2(a+ 1, b+ 1)−E2(a+ 2, b+ 2)) + ···
=E2(a, b)
where the second equality comes from the product formula in (49) and the last equality comes
from successive cancellations with only the first term left. As e′=e′·e=ewe deduce thatPERSISTENCE K-THEORY 33
E1(0)∈image (KA(Ct)j− →K(Ct)). Now use the fact that the map jis linear over Λto
conclude that jis an isomorphism.
For further use, we summarize two direct consequences of Proposition 4.2.4 and Proposition
4.3.2 (see also Proposition 3.5.1).
Corollary 4.3.4. We have the ring isomorphisms j:KA(Cfg)→K(Cfg)(0)(where K(Cfg)(0)
is defined as in (52)) and j:KA(Ct)→K(Ct). In particular, these maps are injective and
thusTorK(Cfg) = 0,TorK(Ct) = 0. Further, K∞(Cfg) =Z,K∞(Ct) = 0.
Remark 4.3.5.Corollary 4.3.4 says that in case C=Cfgthe exact sequence (33) becomes a
short exact sequence of the form
0−→KA(Cfg)j−→K(Cfg)π−→K∞(Cfg)−→0. (58)
Identifying the first two terms, via the isomorphism λ, with Λ(0)
PandΛPrespectively, and the
third term with Zvia the Euler characteristic, we can identify the above sequence with the
following one:
0−→Λ(0)
P−→ΛP−→Z, (59)
where the first map is the inclusion and the second map is given by ΛP∋P(t)7−→P(1)∈Z.
The sequence (58) obviously splits. A preferred splitting seems to come from the following
right and left inverses to πandjrespectively:
K∞(Cfg)−→K(Cfg),[C]7−→χ(C)[E1(0)],
K(Cfg)−→KA(Cfg),[C]7−→[C]−χ(C)[E1(0)].(60)
In terms of the sequence (59) the first map in (60) is just the inclusion Z−→ΛPand the
second map is P(t)7−→P(t)−P(1).
4.4.More relations. In this subsection, we investigate the acyclic truncation maps Qrde-
fined in (24).
Notice that Qris only a homomorphism of abelian groups, since
Qr(E1(a)·E1(b)) =Qr(E1(a+b)) =E2(a+b, a+b+r)
while
Qr(E1(a))·Qr(E1(b)) =E2(a, a+r)·E2(b, b+r)
=E2(a+b, a+b+r)−E2(a+b+r, a+b+ 2r).
The proof of the following result can be found in [10].
Proposition 4.4.1. For any r≥0, the map Qr:K(Ct)→KA(Ct)is an isomorphism of
abelian groups.34 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG

where the two vertical isomorphisms λare the inverses of the isomorphisms ηandη′from
Proposition 4.2.2 and Proposition 4.3.2 respectively, the right-bottom isomorphism σis from
Proposition 4.2.4, and the map ˜Qr: Λ→Λ′is defined by ta7→sa,a+rand extended to Λby
linearity over Z. Notice that ˜Qrmakes the square commutative. Moreover the composition
(σ◦˜Qr)(ta) =σ(sa,a+r) =ta−ta+r
is injective, thus ˜Qris injective. Next we will show that ˜Qris also surjective.
The surjectivity of ˜Qris proved in detail in [10], and here we only outline the main idea.
First note that Λis aΛ′-module with structure defined by sa,b·tc:=ta+c−tb+c. It is
straightforward to check that ˜QrisΛ′-linear with respect to this structure. Now, note that
˜Qr(1 +tr+t2r+···) =s0,r+sr,2r+···=u, the unit in Λ′. This shows that ˜Qris surjective.
It now follows that ˜Qris an isomorphism, which implies that Qris an isomorphism too. □
We now investigate the map Qrin the case of Cfg. We have the following commutative dia-

mapped by σ◦˜Qrtota−ta+r. Applying the map π, we have ta−ta+r7→t[a]−t[a]= 0. We
getπ(p) = 0. This shows Im(σ◦˜Qr)⊂ker(π).
Fixp=P

for each c∈R/rZ. We will show that any sub-polynomial pcis in the image of the map

pc=n1tc+m1r+···+nLtc+mLrwhere m1≤ ··· ≤ mL∈Z, (63)
andPL
k=1nk= 0. At this point the argument is similar to the proof of Lemma 4.2.5, by
induction on L. The first non-trivial case is when L= 2, that is pc=ntc+m1r−ntc+m2r. Then
consider x=n(tc+m1r+tc+(m1+1)r+···+tc+(m2−1)r)∈ΛP, and we have
(σ◦˜Qr)(x) =n(tc+m1r−tc+(m1+1)r+tc+(m1+1)r−tc+(m1+2)r
+···+tc+(m2−1)r−tc+m2r) =pc.
Now, assume that any pcin (63) with L-many non-zero terms is in the image. We rewrite a
pcwith (L+ 1)-many non-zero terms, as follows,
pc=n1tc+m1r+···+nLtc+mLr+

Each of the two terms above is in the image by our inductive hypothesis. Therefore, pcis in

Remark 4.4.4.(a) Let Cbe a TPC and fix r∈[0,∞). Recall the notations from §3.5. In
particular, denote by G⟨C⟩the free abelian group generated by the objects of C. A natural
question is whether there are K-type groups of interest obtained by dividing G⟨C⟩by the
subgroup Rrgenerated by the relations of the form B=A−Cfor each strict exact triangle
A→B→C→Σ−sTA
of weight s≤r. In general, this does not lead to something useful. For instance, it is easy
to see that if acyclics of any weight belong to the subgroup of K(C)generated by s-acyclics,
then G⟨C⟩/Rr=C∞. This is what happens in Ct, as it follows from Proposition 4.4.1.36 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG

5.Barcodes, step functions and K-theory for persistence modules
It is natural to associate to an ungraded persistence module {Mα}α∈Rthe real function
given by its dimension α7−→dimk(Mα). By taking into account also graded modules - as in
§5.1 - this provides a way to associate to each persistence module M, or graded barcode B, a
function ¯σBbelonging to a ring LCB[x, x−1]where xis a formal variable keeping track of the
grading and LCBis a ring of bounded step functions R→Rwith a convolution type product.
The value of this representation for x=−1,¯χ= ¯σ|−1, is interpreted in §5.2 as the application
that associates to a persistence module its K-class, in an appropriately defined K-group.
This is a consequence of the fact that LCBis isomorphic as a ring with the universal Novikov
polynomial ring, ΛP, and fits with the description in §4 of the K-group of the homotopy
category of filtered chain complexes. Finally, in §5.3 we use the theory developed in §5.1
and §5.2 to formulate a general form of Morse inequalities for persistence homology.
Before we go on we remark that some of the material presented in §5.1 and §5.2 below is
analogous to older work of Schapira [31] done in the framework of the category of constructible
sheaves on manifolds.
5.1.The rings LCBand LC.It is very natural to represent barcodes in a ring of functions
that we now describe.
For a subset S⊂Rdenote by 1S:R−→Rthe indicator function on S:
1S(x) =1ifx∈S
0ifx∈R\S.
Denote by Ithe collection of intervals I⊂Rthat are left-closed and right-open, i.e. of the
type I= [a, b)with a∈R,a < b ≤ ∞. Consider the abelian group LCBgenerated by the
indicator functions σIon intervals I∈ I, namely:
LCB=n
σ:R−→Rσ=X
finitenI1I, I∈ I, nI∈Zo
. (64)
Note that the functions σI,I∈ I, are not linear independent. For instance we have 1[a,∞)−
1[b,∞)=1[a,b). If we endow Rwith the lower limit topology (i.e. the topology generated
byI), then the elements of LCBare precisely the locally constant integer valued functions
(with respect to this topology) that are bounded and additionally vanish at −∞(i.e. at small
enough values in R), hence the notation LCB.PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 37
In a similar way, we also have:
LC′
B=(X
finitenI1II∈ Iis an interval of finite length , nI∈Z)
⊂LCB.(65)
Note that in contrast to LCB, all the functions in LC′
Bmust have bounded support, in
particular they vanish also at +∞. The relation 1[a,∞)−1[b,∞)=1[a,b)from LCBdoes not
hold anymore in LC′
Bsince 1[a,∞)and1[b,∞)do not exist in LC′
B. Still, we have the relation
1[a,b)+1[b,c)=1[a,c)for any a < b < c < +∞. There is yet another variant of the above which
we denote by LC. The functions σ∈LCare those functions σ:R−→Rthat can be written
as
σ=X
I∈I0nI1I, (66)
where the sum is taken only over collections of intervals I0⊂ Ithat have the following
property: either I0is finite, or I0={[aj, bj)}j∈Nwith aj→ ∞asj→ ∞. Clearly we have
LC′
B⊂LCB⊂LC. In §5.2 below we will endow LC,LCBwith ring structures such that LC′
B
will become an ideal of LCB. We remark already here that these ring structures are not the
“standard” ones in the sense that the multiplication of two functions from LC(orLCB) is not
the function obtained by pointwise multiplication of the two functions, but quite a different
operation.
We use here the barcode conventions from §2.3. Let B={(Ij, mj)}j∈Jbe an ungraded
barcode. There is a natural function σB∈LCassociated to Bby the formula:
σB=X
j∈Jnj1Ij. (67)
One reason this definition is natural is that if Mis an (ungraded) persistence module with
barcode BM, then
σBM(α) = dim k(Mα).
The following are straightforward to verify for every ungraded barcode B:
(i)σB≥0.
(ii)σB∈LCBiffBhas finitely many bars.
(iii) Assume σB∈LCB(i.e.Bhas finitely many bars). Then σB∈LC′
Biff all the bars in
Bhave finite length.
(iv) If Bcontainsonlybarsofinfinitelengththen σB:R−→Risanon-decreasingfunction.
(v) For every non-negative and non-decreasing function σ∈LCthere exists a barcode B
all of whose bars are of infinite length, such that σB=σ.
We now extend the definition of σBto graded barcodes. For this we extend the rings LC
andLCBby adding formal polynomial variables x, x−1(that take into account the degree)
thus obtaining rings LC[x, x−1]andLCB[x, x−1].38 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
LetB={Bi}i∈Zbe a graded barcode, with Bi={(I(i)
j, m(i)
j)}j∈J(i). We define
¯σB:=X
i∈ZσBixi=X
i∈ZX
j∈J(i)m(i)
j1I(i)
jxi. (68)
We will also need the following expression:
¯χB= ¯σB|x=−1=X
i∈Z(−1)iσBi (69)
Remark 5.1.1.LetM•={Mi}i∈Zbe a graded persistence module whose barcode satisfies the
conditions at the beginning of §5. Recall that we denote by BM•the graded barcode of M•.
Thus we have:
¯σBM•(α) =X
idimk(Mα
i)xi 
=X
iσBMi(α)xi!
(70)
which shows that ¯σBM•simply tracks the sum of the dimension of the modules Mα
iover all i
when αvaries. Similarly, ¯χBM•(α) =χα(M•)where χα(M•)is the Euler characteristic of the
graded vector space Mα
•that we have already seen in (44).
5.2.Ring structures on LC,LCBand K-groups. We will now endow LCandLCBwith
ring structures. Obviously LCandLCBare closed under standard (point-wise) multiplication
of functions (because 1I·1I′=1I∩I′; though note that 1R/∈LC). However the ring structure
relevant for our purposes will be completely different. To this end we need to use the notions
of distributions and convolutions from classical analysis which we briefly recall next.
Given a locally integrable function fonR, we identify it with the regular distribution Tf,
a linear functional on C∞(R)defined by Tf(ϕ) =R
Rf(x)ϕ(x)dx. There are two important
operations on distributions.
(i) The derivative Dof a distribution, defined by D(Tf)(ϕ) :=−Tf(ϕ′).
(ii) For any two locally integrable functions fandgonR, define the convolution Tf∗Tg=
Tf∗g, where (f∗g)(x) :=R
Rf(x−y)g(y)dy.
Recall also that we have:
D(Tf∗Tg) =D(Tf)∗Tg=Tf∗D(Tg). (71)
We define a product on LC, which we denote by ◦, as follows:
σ1◦σ2:=D(σ1∗σ2). (72)
Note that by (71) we have σ1◦σ2=D(σ1)∗σ2=σ1∗D(σ2). The right-hand side of (72) is a
priori only a distribution, but as we will see below it is a regular distribution that moreover
corresponds to a function in LC. We view this function as the result of the operation σ1◦σ2.
Furthermore, we will also see that if σ1, σ2∈LCBthen σ1◦σ2∈LCB.
The rings LCB,LCare in fact isomorphic to the Novikov rings that we have seen earlier in
the paper. Before we state this result, let us recall some relevant notation from §2.1 and §4:PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 39
Λis the universal Novikov ring and ΛPandΛ(0)
Pare respectively the Novikov polynomials and
the ideal corresponding to those polynomials that vanish for t= 1.
Proposition 5.2.1. The operation ◦defined in (72)turns LCandLCBinto commutative
unital rings where the unity is given by 1[0,∞). Moreover, the subgroup LC′
B⊂LCBis an ideal
with respect to this ring structure. Furthermore, there is a ring isomorphism θ: Λ∼=− →LC,
uniquely defined by the property that θ(ta) =1[a,∞). The restriction of θtoΛP⊂Λgives a
ring isomorphism ΛP∼=− →LCB, and θsends the ideal Λ(0)
PtoLC′
B.
The proof of this proposition is quite elementary, based on direct calculations and identities
involving convolutions. A detailed proof can be found in [10].
Remark 5.2.2.In terms of the “convolution product” introduced in [31, Section 4], the product
◦onLCdefined in (72) is the convolution product inside the space of constructible functions.
As a concrete example, for finite intervals [a, b)and[c, d)inR, one computes that 1[a,b)◦
1[c,d)=1[a+c,min{b+c,a+d})−1[max{b+c,a+d},b+d).Interestingly, thissharescertaincommonfeatures
with Example 4.1.1 on the tensor product of elementary filtered chain complexes. From a
different perspective, if we identify 1[a,b)with the locally constant sheaf k[a,b)overR, then the
computational result on the product 1[a,b)◦1[c,d)also coincides with the “sheaf convolution”,
denoted by ∗, ofk[a,b)andk[c,d)(see [37, Example 3.6]). The study of the sheaf convolution
∗was initiated by Tamarkin in [33, Section 3.1.2] with further applications, for instance,
to persistence module theory (see [22, Section 2.1]). Our Proposition 5.2.1 above and [31,
Theorem 3.4] identify (via the Euler characteristic) the Novikov ring Λ, the function space
LC, and the K-group of the derived category of constructible sheaves on R.
In view of Proposition 5.2.1 we have the following relation for all graded barcodes B:
¯χB=θ(λB) (73)
where θis the ring isomorphism in Proposition 5.2.1, ¯χBappears in (69) and λ(−)is the map
from barcodes to Λas defined in §2.3, see also Remark 4.1.3. This identity has a K-theoretic
interpretation that we outline before proceeding to the proof of Proposition 5.2.1. It is best
understood through the following diagram.

λ//ΛPθ//LCB(74)
HerePMis the category of persistence modules that have barcodes with only finitely many
bars. This category can be viewed as a filtered dg-category (with trivial differential) and
thus can be completed, by using twisted complexes, to a pre-triangulated filtered dg-category
Tw(PM)as in [12, §6.1]. Therefore the associated homotopy category H0Tw(PM)is a TPC.
The two left top horizontal arrows are the obvious functors. The category of filtered, finitely40 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
generated chain complexes maps to PMthrough the persistence homology functor, denoted
H. The functor E:H0FChfg→H0(Tw(PM))is a TPC equivalence defined as a composition
H0FChfgj−→H0(Tw(FChfg))H′
−→H0(Tw(PM))
where H′is induced by Handjis the obvious inclusion. It is easy to see that they are
both equivalences, in the case of jbecause H0FChfgis already pre-triangulated. The dashed
arrows ¯σ,λare defined only on the objects of the respective categories ( ¯σfrom (68) admits
an obvious extension to twisted modules). In view of Proposition 4.2.2, λis the map taking
a chain complex Cto its class [C]∈K(H0FChfg)∼=ΛP. The two squares in the diagram
commute and θis a ring isomorphism. In summary, we have
ΛP∼=K(H0FChfg)∼=K(H0Tw(PM))∼=LCB
and¯χcanbeviewedasassociatingtoapersistencemoduleits K-classin LCB∼=K(Tw(PM)).
5.3.PersistenceMorseinequalities. Therepresentationofpersistencemodulesinthering
LC[x, x−1]leads to a natural version of the Morse inequalities in this context.
LetC= (C•, ∂, ℓ)be a tame filtered chain complex - see §2.2. Forgetting the differential,
we can regard Cas a graded persistence module ¯C•with ¯Cα
k=C≤α
kand persistence structural
mapsgivenbytheinclusions C≤α
k⊂C≤β
k,∀α≤β. Itsbarcodehas obviously onlyinfinitebars.
We also consider the graded persistence module H•(¯C)obtained by taking the persistence
homology of C:
Hk(¯Cα) =Hk(C≤α).
We put
PC:= ¯σB¯CandHC:= ¯σBH(¯C)
where ¯σappears in (70). These two functions belong to the ring LC[x, x−1]. They track the
dimensions of the respective persistence modules, in each degree, when αvaries.
Proposition 5.3.1. Assume that the filtered chain complex Cis bounded. There exists a
polynomial QC(x)∈LCB[x, x−1]such that
PC(x)−HC(x) = (1 + x)QC(x),
and such that each coefficient of QC(x)is a non-negative and non-decreasing function in LCB.
Note that when evaluating the coefficients of PC(x),HC(x)andQC(x)at∞(recall that
every function in LCBis constant near ∞), the conclusion in Proposition 5.3.1 recovers the
classical Morse inequalities expressed in terms of the so-called Poincaré polynomials.
Example 5.3.2.HereisasimpleexamplereflectingtheconclusioninProposition5.3.1. Assume
C=E2(a, b)with the generator in filtration aof degree 0and the generator in filtration bof

The function 1[b,∞)∈LCBis the function QC(x)claimed by Proposition 5.3.1.
Proof of Proposition 5.3.1. We will use the following lemma.
Lemma 5.3.3. LetU, V, Wbe ungraded persistence k-modules, and 0→U→V→W→0
a short exact sequence of persistence k-modules (in particular, the arrows are all persistence
morphisms), then we have σBV=σBU+σBW.
Theproofofthelemmaisstraightforwardsinceweworkoverafieldand σBV(α) = dim k(Vα)
and similarly for UandW.
We now get back to the proof of Proposition 5.3.1. For any degree k∈N, there are two
persistence k-modules associated to the filtered vector space Ckdefined as follows

kσBBkxk. Note that only infinite-length bars
appear in each of the persistence k-modules Bk, therefore each coefficient σBBk∈LCBof the
polynomial QC(x)is a non-negative and non-decreasing function. □
A useful application of Proposition 5.3.1 is given next.42 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
Corollary 5.3.4. Letϕ:G→G′be a filtered chain map of two finitely generated chain
complexes and let G′′= Cone( ϕ)be the filtered cone of ϕ. We have the inequality:
#(BH(G′′))≤#(BH(G)) + #( BH(G′))
where #(B•)denotes the cardinality of the intervals in the corresponding barcode.
Proof.The proof is based on a simple interpretation of the polynomial QCfrom Proposition
5.3.1. Let Cbe a filtered chain complex. By rewriting the complex Cin normal form as in
(38)
C∼=M
E1(ai)[−ki]⊕M
E2(bj, cj)[−kj]
we see that the value of QC(1)∈LCBforα=∞, denoted by QC(1)|∞, gives the number of
the terms E2(bj, cj)in this decomposition. This number satisfies:
QC(1)|∞= #(BH(C)) +N0
C−HC(1)|∞
where N0
Cis the number of terms E2(bj, cj)with bj=cj(these terms correspond to so-called
ghost bars) and clearly HC(1)|∞is the number of infinite bars in BH(C). From Proposition
5.3.1 we have that QC(1) =PC(1)−HC(1)
2and thus
#(BH(C)) +N0
C=[PC(1)−HC(1)]|∞
2+HC(1)|∞=[PC(1) +HC(1)]|∞
2
Returning to the statement, assume for a moment, to simplify the argument, that N0
G=
0 =N0
G′. We then have
2#(BH(G′′))≤PG′′(1)|∞+HG′′(1)|∞
=PG(1)|∞+PG′(1)|∞+HG′′(1)|∞
= 2#( BH(G)) + 2#( BH(G′))−HG(1)|∞−HG′(1)|∞+HG′′(1)|∞
≤2#(BH(G)) + 2#( BH(G′)).
We have used here the obvious relations PG′′(1) =PG(1) +PG′(1).
We are left to showing the general case, when N0
GandN0
G′do not necessarily vanish. By
[35, Theorem B], for these GandG′, there exist filtered chain complexes G1, G′
1and filtered
chain homotopies ψ, ψ′as follows,
ψ:G≃G1and ψ′:G1≃G′
1
where G1andG′
1do not have any ghost bars. In particular, BH(G)=BH(G1)andBH(G′)=
BH(G′
1). Replace ϕ:G→G′in our assumption with a filtered chain map ϕ1:G1→G′
1,
constructed from ϕby (pre)-compositing the homotopy inverse of ψand map ψ′, then the
resulting filtered cone G′′
1= Cone( ϕ′)is filtered quasi-isomorphic to G′′. Thus BH(G′′)=
BH(G′′
1). Therefore, we can conclude the proof from the previous discussion where no ghost
bars exist. □PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 43
Remark 5.3.5.(a) Related, and somewhat more refined, bar counting inequalities appear in
[15] where they are shown by different methods.
(b) It is easy to see that the Corollary above implies that if
0→M→N→Z→0
is a short exact sequence of persistence modules with MandZhaving barcodes with finite
numbers of bars, then the number of bars in the barcode of Nis at most the sum of the
numbers of bars of BMandBZ, a result that again appears in [15].
(c) By rotating an exact triangle G→G′→G′′→TGof filtered chain complexes in
the category Cfg(see [12, Remark 2.46]), the Corollary above also implies that #(BH(G))≤
#(BH(G′)) + #( BH(G′′)).
6.AK-theoretic pairing
In this section, we will prove one of the main results in this paper, that is, there exists a
bilinear pairing on the K-group of a TPC Cunder the assumption that Cis tame and bounded.
6.1.The pairing. We will work here with a tame and bounded triangulated persistence
category Cas in Definition 2.4.1, with shift functor Σand translation functor T.
We will construct a group homomorphism qX:K(C)−→Λfor every X∈Obj(C)as follows.
LetX∈Obj(C). Given N∈Obj(C), recall the graded persistence module
homC(X, T•N) :={homC(X, TiN)}i∈Z
from (13). Define ˜qX: Obj(C)−→Λby
˜qX(N) :=λhomC(X,T•N), (75)
where λ(−)is as in (14) (see also (12)). This is well-defined because Cis tame and bounded.
We can extend ˜qXlinearly on the free abelian group generated by Obj(C).
Theorem 6.1.1. The linear map ˜qXdefined above descends to a homomorphism
qX:K(C)−→Λ.
Moreover, the map κ: Obj( C)×Obj(C)→ΛPdefined by κ(X, Y) =qX(Y)induces a
bi-linear map of ΛP-modules
κ:K(C)⊗ΛPK(C)−→Λ.
Here K(C)is the same as K(C)as a group but the ΛP-structure is reversed in the sense
thattaacts as Σ−a, as in §3.6, where Σsis the shift functor in C. We denote the action of ΛP
onK(C)by·and the action on K(C)by·.
Remark 6.1.2.(1) Given that κis bilinear with the ΛP-module K(C)on the first term,
it follows that κis not symmetric. Indeed, assuming κ(X, Y) =κ(Y, X)̸= 0for two
objects X,Y, then, for r̸= 0, we have κ(ΣrX, Y) =t−rκ(X, Y) =t−rκ(Y, X) =44 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
t−2rκ(Y,ΣrX)and thus κ(ΣrX, Y)̸=κ(Y,ΣrX). We will see that in many cases of
interest the form κisskew-symmetric in the sense that we have
κ(X, Y)(t) = (−1)ϵκ(Y, X)(t−1) (76)
where ϵ=ϵC∈Z/2is a global constant associated to the category C.
(2) The self-pairing κ(X, X ), applied to objects X∈Obj(C), is invariant under shifts and
translations in the sense that κ(ΣrTkX,ΣrTkX) =κ(X, X )for every r∈R,k∈Z,
where ΣrandTare the shift and translation functors, respectively. This easily follows
from the definitions.
Example 6.1.3.Consider the category Cfg=H0(FChfg). We will describe κin this case
by using the identification K(Cfg)∼=ΛPas in Proposition 4.2.2. It is enough to calculate
κ(E1(a), E1(c))and extend this by linearity. We claim:
κ(E1(a), E1(c)) =tc−a. (77)
Indeed, we have homC(E1(a), TiE1(c)) =E1(c−a)when i= 0and equal to 0otherwise (here
Tiis the shift of the degree by i), so
κ(E1(a), E1(c)) =qE1(a)(E1(c)) =λhomC(E1(a),E1(c))=tc−a.
Therefore, using the identification of K(Cfg)with ΛP,κcan be rewritten on elements of ΛP
in the form
κ(P, Q)(t) =P(t−1)Q(t).
Thus, for Cfgthe pairing κis non-degenerate and skew-symmetric (with ϵ= 0).
Proof of Theorem 6.1.1. We start with the statement concerning qX. We need to show that
for each exact triangle A→B→C→TAinC0we have
˜qX(A)−˜qX(B) + ˜qX(C) = 0 . (78)
To prove this relation in Λwe first remark that a Novikov polynomial P∈Λvanishes if and
only if we have Pα(1) = 0for all α∈R. Here and below, we denote by Pαtheα-truncation
ofP, namely the sum of the monomials in Phaving traised at exponents ≤α.
Given a graded persistence module M•(of finite total rank below each filtration level) we
can define its α-Euler characteristic as:
χα(M•) :=χ(Mα
•). (79)
Using the preceding notation we have:
[λM•]α(1) = χα(M•) (80)
This follows directly from formula (12). See also Remark 5.1.1.
In summary, to prove (78) we need to show that for each αwe have:
χα(hom C(X, T•A))−χα(hom C(X, T•B)) +χα(hom C(X, T•C)) = 0 . (81)PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 45
Notice that homα
C(X,·)is a cohomological functor on C0. We apply it to the exact triangle
A→B→C→TAand get a long exact sequence
··· → homα
C(X, TiA)→homα
C(X, TiB)→homα
C(X, TiC)→homα
C(X, Ti+1A)→ ··· .
By the boundedness assumption, this long exact sequence has only finitely many terms. We
view this long exact sequence as a cochain complex S•(with trivial homology) and regrade its
terms so that the degree of homα
C(X, TiA)is3i, the degree of homα
C(X, TiB)equals 3i+ 1and
finally the degree of homα
C(X, TiC)is3i+ 2. The Euler characteristic of S•vanishes, hence:
0 =χ(S•) =X
i∈N(−1)3idim homα
C(X, TiA) +X
i∈N(−1)3i+1dim homα
C(X, TiB)
+X
i∈N(−1)3i+2dim homα
C(X, TiC).
The parities of 3iand3i+ 2are the same as that of i, while the parities of 3i+ 1andiare
opposite. Therefore,
0 =X
i∈N(−1)idim homα
C(X, TiA)−X
i∈N(−1)idim homα
C(X, TiB)
+X
i∈N(−1)idim homα
C(X, TiC)
which shows relation (81) and concludes the proof.
We now turn to the part of the statement concerned with the map κ. Given an exact
triangle X→Y→Z→TXinC0, we need to show that for each Nwe have:
˜qX(N)−˜qY(N) + ˜qZ(N) = 0 . (82)
Given that the functor homα
C(−, N)is homological on C0and that
homC(T−iX, N )≃homC(X, TiN)∀i, (83)
the same argument as in the first part shows (82). We deduce that κdescends to the tensor
product of groups K(C)⊗K(C). The ΛP-module part of the statement now follows because:
ta·κ([X],[Y]) =κ(ta·[X],[Y]) =κ([X], ta·[Y]).
This is due to the fact that
homα
C(Σ−rX, Y) = homα
C(X,Σr(Y))
for all α, r∈R. □
Remark 6.1.4.The pairing κabove is natural from the point of view of a more general for-
malism of a filtered version of derived functors. More details will appear in [9].46 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
6.2.The exact sequence (33)and the pairing κ.Assume that Cis a TPC and moreover
tame and bounded (see Definition 2.4.1). Recall that we have the exact sequence of ΛP
modules:
0−→TorK(C)−→KA(C)j−→K(C)−→K∞(C)−→0. (84)
Also recall from Theorem 6.1.1 that we have a pairing κ:K(C)⊗ΛPK(C)−→Λ. We will
discuss here some relations between this pairing and the exact sequence (84).
Corollary 6.2.1. There exists a pairing:
κ′:KA(C)⊗ΛPK(C)−→Λ′
that vanishes on TorK(C)⊗ΛPK(C)where Λ′is defined in (57). The pairings κ′andκare
related by: σ◦κ′=κ◦(¯j⊗id), where ¯j:KA(C)−→K(C)is the same as jfrom(84)but
viewed here as a map between modules with the reversed ΛP-structure. The map σ: Λ′−→Λ
is defined in (51)and in §4.3.
In case Cis of finite type, then the pairing κhas values in ΛPand the pairing κ′has values
inΛ′
P≃Λ(0)
P. The pairing κinduces the usual Euler pairing
κ′′:K∞(C)⊗K∞(C)−→Z
through the formula κ′′=κ|t=1.
Proof.Theconstructionof κ′isjustlikethatof κbutisbasedonamap q′
Xthatreplaces qX, for
X∈Obj(AC). In this case: ˜q′
X(N) =λ′
homC(X,T•N)andλ′
(−)is defined for persistence modules
with barcodes with only finite bars through the formula λ′
I=sa,bforI= [a, b), extended
by linearity. Given that Xis acyclic, homC(X, T•N)has a barcode with only finite bars and
thus this q′
X(−)is well defined. Recall from Proposition 4.2.4 that there is a map σ: Λ′→Λ
defined by σ(sa,b) =ta−tbwhich is an isomorphism. It is clear that σ◦κ′=κ◦(¯j⊗id|K(C))
where ¯j:¯KA(C)−→¯K(C)is the same map as j, but with domain and target being KA(C)
andK(C)with the reversed ΛP-module structures.
Out of this we deduce that ˜q′
Xdescends to a map q′
Xdefined on the K-group and that κ′is
well defined through κ′(X, Y) =q′
X(Y). By using the exact sequence (33) it also follows that
κ′vanishes on TorK(C)⊗ΛPK(C).
In case Cis of finite type, then, by Definition 2.4.1 all the persistence modules hom( X, T•Y)
have only finitely many bars. Thus the image of qXis inΛPand so is that of κ. The classical
Euler characteristic of the graded vector space homC∞(X, T•Y)is well defined as an integer
and it is equal to κ(X, Y)(1)because the finite bars have a trivial contribution to this sum.
Finally, in this case κ′lands in Λ′
Pwhich is mapped by σisomorphically to Λ(0)
P(see Lemma
4.2.5). □
6.3.Skew-symmetry of the bilinear form κ.We discuss here conditions which ensure
that the bilinear form κis skew-symmetric in the sense of (76).PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 47
Example 6.3.1.As a motivating example, we return to the category FChfg. We already know
from Example 6.1.3 that κis skew-symmetric in this case, but regardless, it is worth noticing
that this fact is a reflection of the Calabi-Yau property of FChfg(see e.g. [17, 23, 18, 16]).
LetC= (C∗, ∂∗, ℓ)∈Obj(FChfg), namely a finitely generated filtered chain complex.
Following [35, Section 2.4] one can construct an algebraic dual of C(with degree shifted by a
fixed number m0∈Z): this is a filtered chain complex, denoted by
C∨= (C∨
∗:= Hom( Cm0−∗,k), δ∗, ℓ∨) (85)
where δ∗:C∨
∗→C∨
∗−1is defined by ϕ∈Hom( Cm0−∗,k)7→δ∗(ϕ) := ( −1)∗·ϕ◦∂m0−∗∈
Hom( Cm0−∗+1,k)and the dual filtration function is defined by
ℓ∨(x∨
i) =−ℓ(xi) (86)
if{xi}iis a basis for C∗and{x∨
i}iis the corresponding dual basis for C∨
∗.
We have the following relation:
λ(C)(t) = (−1)m0λ(C∨)(t−1). (87)
Indeed, Proposition 6.7 in [35] implies that the decompositions (38) for CandC∨are related
via the following correspondence:
(i)E1(a)is a summand of Cif and only if E1(−a)[−m0]is a summand of C∨;
(ii)E2(a, b)is a summand of Cif and only if E2(−b,−a)[−m0+ 1]is a summand of C∨
and this implies (87). The category FChfgsatisfies a form of Calabi-Yau duality in the sense
that for each two objects X, Ythere is a filtered quasi-isomorphism
φX,Y: 
hom( Y, X)∨−→hom( X, Y) (88)
Using now (87) with m0= 0we see that κis skew-symmetric on H0(FChfg).
Example 6.3.1 admits obvious generalizations. For instance, suppose Ais a pre-triangulated
filtered dg-category such that each filtered vector space homA(X, Y)forX, Y∈Obj(A)
is finite dimensional and assume further that Asatisfies a filtered form of the Calabi-Yau
property such that, in particular, that for each two objects X, Ythere is a filtered quasi-
isomorphism as in (88)). We then again deduce that κis skew-symmetric on the K-group
ofH0(A). Of course, a similar result remains true for filtered A∞-categories as long as the
filtered quasi-isomorphisms (88) exist.
It is natural to wonder what is the analogue of the Calabi-Yau property for TPCs. One
possible definition - that will not be developed in full here - is roughly as follows. As a
preliminary, consider a persistence module Mthat is assumed to have only finitely many
bars. Define a new persistence module M∨as follows
(M∨)α= (M−α)∗,
where V∗:= hom k(V,k)is the dual vector space of V. The persistence structural maps on
M∨are induced in the obvious way and possible degree shifts are neglected.48 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
Remark6.3.2.Noticethatif Mislowersemi-continuousandlowerboundedasinthedefinition
of triangulated persistence categories used in this paper (see §2.2), then M∨is upper semi-
continuous and upper bounded. In terms of barcodes, the bars of Mare of the form [a,+∞)
and[c, d)and the corresponding ones for M∨are(−∞,−a]and(−d,−c], respectively.
Assume now that Cis a TPC. We will say that Cis Calabi-Yau if the triangulated category
category C∞is (strict) Calabi-Yau and moreover the following holds: for any two objects X,
YofCthere is an isomorphism Φ = Φ X,Y: [hom C∞(Y, X)]∗→homC∞(X, Y)and there are
persistence morphisms:
φ=φX,Y: [hom C(Y, X)]∨→homC(X, Y)
such that for each α∈Rthe natural map ker(φ−∞)→ker(φα)is surjective and the map
coker( φα)→coker( φ∞)is injective. Moreover, the isomorphism Φis required to be tied to φ
as follows. First notice that ker(φ−∞) = [hom C∞(Y, X)]∗andhomC∞(X, Y) = coker( ϕ∞)so
we can view Φ : ker( φ−∞)→coker( φ∞). We now require for each x∈ker(φ−∞),
sup{α∈R|x∈ker(φα)}= inf
β∈R|Φ(x)∈coker( φβ)	
.
These conditions ensure, in particular, that if the barcode in the domain of φcontains, re-
spectively, (−∞, a]and(c, d]then the image of φcontains [a,∞)and[c, d). As a result, if C
is Calabi-Yau in this sense, then the bilinear form κis skew-symmetric on K(C).
Remark 6.3.3.The Poincaré duality property for persistence modules, or more essentially for
filtered chain complexes, has been developed in detail in the recent work [34], where it is called
the chain-level Poincaré-Novikov structure (see [34, Section 6]). This could provide a rigorous
foundation for the Calabi-Yau property of our TPCs.
7.Measurements on the K-group and on barcodes.
In contrast to usual triangulated categories, triangulated persistence categories are endowed
withexacttrianglesofarbitrarynon-negativeweights. Asaresult, thereisanotionof“energy”
required to decompose objects through (iterated) exact triangles and, in particular, the set
of objects of a TPC, C, carries a class of pseudo-metrics called fragmentation pseudo-metrics
as recalled in §2.5. In this section we first see in §7.1 that these metric structures descend
toK(C)and they sometimes give non-trivial structures there. On the other hand, in §7.2 we
discuss numerical invariants associated to persistence modules and barcodes that are natural
from the point of view of the representation in LCfrom §5.1.
7.1.Group semi-norms on K(C).LetCbe a TPC. Let dbe a pseudo-metric on Obj(C)
that is subadditive in the sense that
d(X⊕X′, Y⊕Y′)≤d(X, Y) +d(X′, Y′). (89)
Such pseudo-metrics exist in abundance. Indeed, as shown in [11, §5] and recalled in §2.4,
the category C∞admits a persistence triangular weight wthat is subadditive. As a result,
Obj(C)carries a class of pseudo-metrics dF(where Fis an auxiliary family of objects of C),PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 49
called fragmentation pseudo-metrics, associated to w. Their construction is recalled in §2.5.
The subadditivity of wimplies (89) for all such dF.
The main result in this section deals with “measurements” induced by these pseudo-metrics
onK(C). There are two natural notions that we will discuss.
First, define a map ¯d:K(C)×K(C)→R≥0as follows,
¯d(x, y) = inf {d(X, Y)|X, Y∈Obj(C)and[X] =x,[Y] =y}. (90)
We will see below that this definition leads to a pseudo-metric on K(C)that is invariant by
translation and, thus, the map x7−→ ¯d(x,0)provides a so-called group semi-norm (possibly
infinite) on K(C)that determines ¯d. However, we will see that this pseudo-metric (and the
associated semi-norm), is trivial in some of our main examples.
Another possibility is to consider a sub-class S ⊂Obj(C)such that Sis closed with respect
to the direct sum and, moreover, each element of K(C)has a representative in Sand define
|| − || d,S:K(C)−→R≥0by
||x||d,S= inf{d(X,0)|X∈ Sand[X] =x}. (91)
This definition also gives a group semi-norm on K(C), that we will call the strong semi-norm
induced by d(relative to S). In contrast to ¯d(−,0), there are simple examples when dis a
fragmentation pseudo-metric and || − || d,Sis finite and not trivial. This will be shortly shown
in Proposition 7.1.2 below.
Remark 7.1.1.Before we go on let us explain in more detail the essential difference between
¯dand∥ − ∥ d,S. By definition ¯d(x,0)is the infimum of the “distances” d(X, Y)where Xand
Ygo over all elements of Obj (C)whose classes in K(C)are[X] =xand[Y] = 0. (Thus
the second entry in ¯d(x,0)stands for 0∈K(C).) By contrast, in the definition of ∥x∥d,Swe
infimize d(X,0)only over X, so that the second entry in d(X,0)is taken to be the 0object
rather than only a representative of 0∈K(C). In addition, we vary Xonly over the subset
S ⊂Obj(C).
Proposition 7.1.2. LetCbe a triangulated persistence category.
(i) Any pseudo-metric donObj(C)that is subadditive as in (89) induces a pseudo-metric
¯dgiven by (90) that is translation invariant in the sense that
¯d(x+z, y+z) =¯d(x, y)
for all x, y, z ∈K(C).
(ii) The bottleneck metric dboton the objects of Cfg=H0(FChfg)descends to a pseudo-
metric on K(Cfg)∼=ΛPthat only takes the values 0and∞. We refer the reader to [28]
for the definition and more details on the bottleneck metric.
(iii) Let dFbe the fragmentation pseudo-metric on Cfgassociated to the persistence weight
¯wonCfgwithF={E1(0)[s]}s∈Z. (See §2.5 for the definitions.) The induced pseudo-
metric ¯dFonK(Cfg)∼=ΛPvanishes.50 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
(iv) The application || − || d,Sfrom (91) is a group semi-norm on K(C)and, for C=Cfg,
d=dFas at point (iii), and Sthe subclass of filtered chain complexes with trivial
differential, || − || d,Sis finite and we have
||ta||d,S=|a|
for all a <0. Thus || − || d,Sis not trivial in this case.
A detailed proof of the proposition can be found in [10].
Remark 7.1.3.(1) A similar result to point (iii) of Proposition 7.1.2 has been indepen-
dently established by Berkouk [4] in the more general context of the K-group of the
category of constructible sheaves over vector spaces of arbitrary finite dimension.
(2) If the family Fused before is replaced with F={E1(r)[s]}s∈Z, for some fixed r >0,
the resulting strong fragmentation semi-norm || − || d,Swill not vanish on polynomials
with a0< r(hereSis as before the class of filtered complexes with trivial differential).
On the other hand, if the family Fis as in the proposition but S= Obj( Cfg), then the
resulting pseudo-norm || − || d,Sis trivial.
(3) The strong fragmentation pseudo-norm associated to the bottleneck metric on Cfgis
infinite for all complexes Asuch that H(A)̸= 0.
7.2.K-theoretic numerical invariants. In this section we will construct several numerical
invariants of filtered chain complexes that can be defined at the level of the K-theories of
H0(FChfg),AH0(FChfg)andH0(FCht). This means that the values of our invariants on a
given object C(i.e. a filtered chain complex) depend only on its K-class.
Since (graded) barcodes are in 1−1correspondence with isomorphism types of filtered chain
complexes in the categories H0(FChfg)andH0(FCht), we will view the numerical invariants
constructed below as invariants associated to barcodes.
Before we begin recall that we have the following isomorphisms
KA(H0(FChfg))∼=− →Λ(0)
P, K (H0(FChfg))∼=− →ΛP, K (H0(FCht))∼=− →Λ,(92)
which assign to the K-class [C]of a filtered chain complex Cthe Novikov polynomial (resp.
series) λ([C]) = λB(H•(C)), where H•(C)is the persistence homology of C,B(H•(C))is its
(graded) barcode and λB(−)is defined in §2.3. By abuse of notation we denote all three
isomorphisms above by λsince they are compatible one with the other with respect to the
following maps
KA(H0(FChfg))−→K(H0(FChfg))−→K(H0(FCht))
induced from the inclusions AFChfg⊂FChfg⊂FCht(see Theorem 4.1.2).
Recall also from Proposition 5.2.1 that we have an isomorphism of rings θ: Λ∼=− →LCthat
also sends Λ(0)
P⊂ΛP⊂Λisomorphically to LC′
B⊂LCB⊂LC. Thus, by composing λ
with θwe obtain an LCB-function (resp. LC-function) ¯χ([C])associated to every class [C]in
K(H0(FChfg))andK(H0(FCht))respectively, namely ¯χ([C]) := θ◦λ([C]).PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 51
As mentioned above one can define the functions ¯χdirectly on the level of barcodes. Recall
from §5.1 that given a graded barcode B={Bi}i∈Zwe define
¯χB=X
i∈Z(−1)iσBi∈LC. (93)
IfBtotcontains only a finite number of bars, then ¯χB∈LCBand if moreover each of these
bars is of finite-length then ¯χB∈LC′
B. Below we will construct several numerical invariants
of barcodes (or K-classes of filtered chain complexes) using the functions ¯χ.
Some of the material in §7.2.1- §7.2.3 bears similarity with older work of Schapira [31] done
in the framework of the category of constructible sheaves on manifolds. Other related, more
recent, work can be found in [13, 19, 26].
7.2.1.Euler characteristic. The classical Euler characteristic of finitely generated chain com-
plexes induces a well defined homomorphism χ:K(H0(FChfg))−→Zthat factors through
the obvious map K(H0(FChfg))−→K(H0(Chfg))and the classical Euler characteristic. Here
we have denoted by K(H0(Chfg))theK-group of the homotopy category of finitely generated
chain complexes (endowed with no filtrations).
In terms of barcodes this has the following description. Suppose Bis stable at infinity,
that is, the associated graded persistence module has its persistence structure maps being
isomorphisms when the filtration parameter is sufficiently large. Assume in addition that Btot
has only finitely many bars of infinite length. Then the Euler characteristic ofB, denoted by
χ(B), is equal to ¯χB(∞).
If we use the ΛP-model for K(H0(FChfg))then χ(B) =λB|t=1. This coincides also with
the total Euler characteristic of the underlying chain complex of a filtered chain complex C
in the sense that χ(C) = ¯χ([C])(∞) =λ([C])|t=1.
7.2.2.Length.Here we define a homomorphism ℓ:K(H0(FChfg))−→Rwhich we call length
as follows. Identify K(H0(FChfg))∼=LCB(using θ◦λas explained at the beginning of §7.2.
Recall that all functions σ∈LCBare bounded and moreover constant at infinity. We define:
ℓ(σ) =Z
R 
σ−σ(∞)1[0,∞)
dµ,∀σ∈LCB, (94)
where dµis the Lebesgue measure on R. Note that the function σ−σ(∞)1[0,∞)has compact
support hence its integral over Ris finite.
If we restrict ℓtoKA(H0(FChfg))∼=LC′
B, then
ℓ(σ) =Z
Rσdµ, ∀σ∈LC′
B,
since all functions σ∈LC′
Bsatisfy σ(∞) = 0.
The analogous definition of length for barcodes goes as follows. Let Bbe a graded barcode
withBtotconsisting of finitely many bars. Let ¯χB∈LCBbe its associated LC-function as52 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
defined in (93). We define the length of Bto be ℓ(B) := ℓ(¯χB), where the latter is defined
using (94). More explicitly:
ℓ(B) =Z
R 
¯χB−¯χB(∞)1[0,∞)
dµ. (95)
Remark7.2.1.(a) The reason for the name “length” is the following. In case B={(Ij, mj)}j∈J
is anungraded barcode with finitely many bars all of which of finite length then ℓ(B)is the
sum of the lengths of the bars in B(taking multiplicities into account). This is so because
¯χB(∞) = 0, hence
ℓ(B) =Z
R¯χBdµ=X
j∈JmjZ
R1Ijdµ=X
j∈Jmjlength (Ij).
Note that in this case ℓ(B)≥0with equality if and only if B=∅.
In case B={Bi}i∈Zis a graded barcode (with Btothaving only finitely many bars and all
of finite length) then
ℓ(B) =X
i∈Z(−1)iℓ(Bi)
is just the signed sum of the lengths of the Bi’s. In contrast to the case of ungraded bars, here
ℓ(B)can assume also negative values and it may also happen that ℓ(B) = 0even if B ̸=∅.
(b) The integrand in the definition of length in (94) is very much related to the K-group of
the acyclics in FChfg. Indeed, the map
LCB−→LC′
B, σ7−→σ−σ(∞)1[0,∞)
correspondsundertheisomorphisms K(H0(FChfg))∼=LCB,KA(H0(FChfg))∼=LC′
B, defined
byθ◦λ, to the map
K(H0(FChfg))−→KA(H0(FChfg)),[C]7−→[C]−χ(C)[E1(0)]
from (60) in Remark 4.3.5. □
Next we give an alternative expression for ℓwhich is useful when working with the identifi-
cation K(H0(FChfg))∼=ΛP(via the isomorphisms λas in (92)). More precisely, we consider
hereℓ◦θ: ΛP−→R, where θ: ΛP−→LCBis the isomorphisms from Proposition 5.2.1. By
abuse of notation we denote ℓ◦θbyℓ.
LetP(t)∈ΛPbe a Novikov polynomial. A simple calculation shows that
ℓ(P(t)) =−P′(1), (96)
where P′(1)stands for the derivative of P(t)with respect to the formal variable t, calculated
att= 1.
The last formula has the following consequence. Recall that K(H0(FChfg))has a product
induced from tensor products of filtered chain complexes [C]·[D] = [C⊗D].PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 53
Corollary 7.2.2. For every X, Y∈K(H0(FChfg))andn≥1we have
ℓ(X·Y) =ℓ(X)χ(Y) +χ(X)ℓ(Y),
ℓ(Xn) =nχ(X)n−1ℓ(X).(97)
This follows easily from (96), the fact that λis an isomorphism of rings and the chain rule
for derivative of products of functions.
Recall that K(H0(FChfg))andKA(H0(FChfg))are both ΛP-modules. With respect to
these structures we have the following formula
Corollary 7.2.3. For all X∈K(H0(FChfg)),P(t)∈ΛPwe have:
ℓ(P(t)X) =P(1)ℓ(X) +P′(1)χ(X).
In particular, if X∈KA(H0(FChfg))we have ℓ(P(t)X)) =P(1)ℓ(X).
The very last identity means that the restriction ℓ|KA(H0(FChfg)):KA(H0(FChfg))−→Ris
a map of ΛP-modules, if we endow its target Rwith the ΛP-module structure P(t)·x=P(1)x,
∀x∈R.
7.2.3.Generalized length. For simplicity we assume here that the graded barcodes Bunder
consideration satisfy that Btothas only finitely many bars of infinite length.
Given a functional T:LCB−→Rwe can define an associated functional eℓTon graded
barcodes by
eℓT(B) =T(¯χB). (98)
Similarly, given a functional T:LC′
B−→Rwe can define an associated functional ℓTon
graded barcodes by
ℓT(B) =T 
¯χB−¯χB(∞)1[0,∞)
. (99)
Ifh:R−→Ris locally integrable function we can apply the above to the functional Th,
i.e. the distribution associated to h. We denote by
ℓh(B) :=Z
Rh· 
¯χB−¯χB(∞)1[0,∞)
dµ (100)
the corresponding functional on barcodes. In case hsatisfies in addition thatR∞
a|h|dµ <∞
for every a∈R, theneℓh:=eℓThis also well defined.
Both the Euler characteristic and the length considered in §7.2.1 and §7.2.2 are special cases
ofeℓTandℓTfor different T’s. More precisely, χ(B) =eℓδ∞(B)where δ∞is the Dirac delta
function at ∞. Similarly, the length ℓ(B)coincides with ℓh(B)for the function h≡1.
7.3.Other measurements. Here we briefly describe some other numerical invariants of
barcodes that are not K-theoretic (in the sense that the value of the invariants on a barcode
Bdoes not depend solely on ¯χB). For simplicity we assume below that our barcodes Bare
such that Btotcontains only a finite number of bars.54 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
Given a graded barcode B={Bi}i∈Zas above, consider the following LCBfunction:
|σ|B:=σBtot=X
i∈ZσBi∈LCB. (101)
The difference between ¯χBand|σ|Bis that in the latter we take an unsigned sum of the
functions σBi, hence we always have |σ|B≥0with equality if and only if B=∅.
One can now apply different functionals, as in §7.2.3 above to the functions |σ|Bto obtain
various measurements on barcodes.
For example, in case Btothas only bars of finite length we can define its absolute total length :
|ℓ|(B) :=Z
R|σ|Bdµ.
When Bcomes from the filtered Morse persistent homology, |ℓ|(B)has been studied and
applied in analysis and spectral theory [28, Chapter 6].
Another measurement is the following (here we do notassume that Bhas no bars of infinite
length).
ℓ(B) =ℓ(Bfinite) +χ(B), (102)
where Bfiniteis the subset of Bconsisting of all its finite-length bars, and χ(B)is the Euler
characteristic of Bdefined in §7.2.1.
The preceding invariant ¯ℓbehaves nicely with respect to tensor products. For any two
graded barcodes B′andB′′one can define a product B′⊗B′′which is the barcode of the tensor
product of the corresponding persistence modules or filtered chain complexes (cf. Example
4.1.1). We have the following identity (see [10] for the proof):
ℓ(B′⊗ B′′) =ℓ(B′)χ(B′′) +χ(B′)ℓ(B′′)−χ(B′)χ(B′′). (103)
8.Symplectic Applications
The purpose of this section is to consider the persistence K-theory developed earlier in the
paper for the triangulated persistence category C=CFuk(X)associated to a filtered Fukaya
category, Fuk(X,P), as in §2.6, and deduce a couple of symplectic applications.
Both applications identify algebraic properties that differentiate embedded Lagrangians
from immersed ones. The first one, in §8.1, Corollary 8.1.2 (which is a direct consequence
of the K-theoretic constructions in the paper), shows that the Euler type pairing κfrom §6,
has a special behavior on classes A∈K(C)that admit embedded representatives in the sense
thatκ(A, A)is a constant polynomial, equal to the Euler characteristic of the representative.
As it turns out this fails for some classes that represent Lagrangian immersions. The second
application, in Theorem 8.1.4, provides a lower bound on the “energy” required to resolve
the singularities of Lagrangian immersions that represent classes Awith κ(A, A)∈ΛPnon-
constant. In §8.2 we discuss some relations between the constructions above and immersed
Floer theory. In particular, how the expression of κ(A, A)is expected to provide a lower bound
for the number of self-intersection points of an immersed representative of A. This subsection
is somewhat speculative in the sense that we do not fully develop in this paper the theory ofPERSISTENCE K-THEORY 55
filtered Fukaya category in the immersed case. In §8.3 we provide an example to illustrate our
results.
8.1.The pairing κand Lagrangian submanifolds. We assume here the setting and no-
tation from §2.6.2. In particular, we work over the base field Z2, and we use the homological
and grading conventions for Fukaya categories as described at the beginning of §2.6.2. Thus
our ambient manifold (X2n, ω=dλ)is a Liouville manifold. The objects of the category
Fuk(X,P)are a family Xof marked exact Lagrangians in X- these are triples (¯L, h L, θL)
where L⊂Xis a closed (embedded) Lagrangian submanifold, hLis a primitive of λ|L,θLis a
choice of grading. We assume Xto be closed under shifts of primitives and translation of grad-
ing. Finally, Pis a choice of perturbation data such that the resulting A∞-category Fuk(X,P)
is filtered. The triangulated persistence category CFuk(X)is associated to Fuk(X;P)by an
algebraic construction described in §2.6.1 and §2.6.2. In brief, this TPC is the homological
category
CFuk(X) =H0[Fuk(X;P)∇]
where
Fuk(X;P)∇⊂Fmod (Fuk(X;P))
is the closure inside the filtered dg-category Fmod (Fuk(X;P))of filtered Fuk(X;P)- modules
of the (filtered) Yoneda modules Y(L),L∈ X, with respect to iterated cones of weight 0and
with respect to r-isomorphism, for all r≥0. More details appear in §2.6 and we refer to [12]
for the full construction.
Before we go on, let us mention the following two points that will be useful later. Firstly,
ifC, C′are two general objects in CFuk(X), then it might be difficult to explicitly write out
hom( C, C′)in this category. However, when C=LandC′=L′are two objects from X
(i.e. two marked Lagrangians from the family X), then we have:
homCFuk(X)(L, L′) =HF′
0(L, L′) (104)
as persistence modules. More generally, again as persistence modules we have:
homCFuk(X)(L, L′[k]) =HF′
k(L, L′).
Recall that, by definition, TkL′=L′[−k] = (¯L′, hL′, θL′−k).
Recall also from §2.6.2 the second TPC, C′Fuk(X) =H0[Tw(Fuk(X;P)], which is the ho-
mological category of the filtered twisted complexes over Fuk(X;P)as well as the embedding:
¯Θ :C′Fuk(X),→ CF uk(X).
The second remark is that for any C, C′∈Obj(C′Fuk(X))there exists k0∈Nsuch that
homC′Fuk(X)(C, TiC′) = 0 ,whenever |i| ≥k0. (105)
Finally, we denote by Fuk(X)the (unfiltered) Fukaya category of all exact marked La-
grangians in Xand by DFuk(X)the associated derived category. In both cases these notions
neglect filtrations and if this aspect needs to be emphasized we write instead Fukun(X),
DFukun(X)and similarly for other relevant algebraic structures.56 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
A last notation to be recalled here is the Novikov polynomial λM∈ΛPassociated to a per-
sistence module M(whose barcode has finitely many bars) as defined in §2.3, see formula (11)
there.
Lemma 8.1.1. LetL, L′∈ X, viewed as objects of C=CFuk(X). Then
λhomC(L,L′)(t) =λhomC(L′,L[−n])(t−1) (106)
inΛP. Moreover, for every i∈Z, the Novikov polynomial (106)forL′=L[i]is constant and
equals to:
λhomC(L,L[−i])(t) = dim Z2Hn−i(L;Z2).
Proof.The first formula follows from duality in Floer homology. Namely, HFk(L, L′)∼=
HFn−k(L′, L)∗as persistence modules, which with our grading conventions from §2.6.2 reads
HF′j(L, L′)∼=HF′−n−j(L′, L)∗. This together with the discussion in §6.3 relating the bar-
codes of a persistence module and its dual implies (106).
The second statement follows from the way we defined the filtrations on the Floer complexes
in the category Fuk(X;P), as recalled in §2.6.2, namely CF∗(L, L)coincides with the Morse
complex CM∗(fL)of a Morse function fL:L→R, with all generators in action level 0. With
our grading conventions we now have
CF′
j(L, L[−i]) =CFn+j−i(L, L) =CM n+j−i(fL),
hence HF′0(L, L[−i])∼=Hn−i(L;Z2). □
Denote C′:=C′Fuk(X). Recall from §6 that we have two pairings:
κ′:K(C′)⊗ΛPK(C′)−→ΛP,
κ:K(C)⊗ΛPK(C)−→Λ,
andκ′is compatible with κvia the map K(C′)−→K(C), induced by the inclusion C′−→ C.
Therefore we will denote below both pairings by κ.
Due to the boundedness property (105) of the category C′the values of the pairing κare
inΛPand not just Λ. Although κis defined on the tensor product K(C′)⊗ΛPK(C′)we will
often write κ(−,−)viewing it as a bilinear map. This pairing can be explicitly written out as
follows
κ([C],[C′]) =X
i(−1)iλhomC(C,TiC′)(t), (107)
for any two elements [C],[C′]∈K(C′). Notice also that, according to our conventions, TiC′=
C′[−i]. We now have.
Corollary 8.1.2. For every two objects C, C′ofC′Fuk(X)we have
κ([C],[C′])(t) = (−1)nκ([C′],[C])(t−1).PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 57
In particular, κ([C],[C])(t) = (−1)nκ([C],[C])(t−1). Moreover if a class A∈K[CFuk(X)]
can be represented by an embedded Lagrangian L∈ Xthen
κ(A, A) = (−1)nχ(¯L),
where χ(¯L)is the Euler characteristic of the underlying Lagrangian ¯LofL.
Proof.Recall that the objects of C′Fuk(X)can be viewed as (filtered) twisted complexes of
the Lagrangians in X. Equivalently, they are iterated cones of weight 0of the Yoneda modules
Y(L),L∈ X. The proof now follows by linearity from Lemma 8.1.1 and (107). □
Remark 8.1.3.(i) It is not expected for the relation in Corollary 8.1.2 to hold for all the
objects in CFuk(X). Each such object is r-isomorphic to an object of C′Fuk(X)for some
r≥0but if r >0this is insufficient to deduce the relation in the statement.
(ii) Since the Euler characteristic of closed odd-dimensional manifolds vanishes, the last
formula in Corollary 8.1.2 could just as well be written as κ(A, A) =χ(¯L).
(iii) The self κ-pairing κ([C],[C])of an element [C]∈K(C), where C∈Obj(C′Fuk(X)), is
invariant both under action shifts as well as translations of C, in the sense that
κ([ΣrTkC],[ΣrTkC]) =κ([C],[C]),
for all r∈R,k∈Z, where ΣrandTare the shift and translation functors, respectively.
The core of Corollary 8.1.2 is that if a class A∈K(C)can be represented by an embedded
Lagrangian, then the Euler type Novikov polynomial κ(A, A)is constant. An interesting
question is to consider cases when κ(A, A)is not constant and try to estimate how far from
embeddings are representatives of A.
We will discuss below two answers to this question, the first interprets “how far” in the sense
of the measurements introduced in relation to the fragmentation pseudo-metrics discussed in
§2.5. The second is concerned with lower bounds for the minimal number of self-intersection
points of possible immersed representatives of A, and is only briefly covered in Remark 8.2.1.
To formulate the first result we need some further notation. The first is the notion of gap,
gap(Q), of a polynomial Q∈ΛP. Assuming that Q=Pk
i=1aitαi,αi< α i+1andai̸= 0for all
i, we define
gap(Q) = min {αi+1−max{αi,0} |1≤i≤k−1, αi+1≥0} ∈R≥0
while if αj<0for all j, we simply set gap(Q) := 0.
The second notation applies to any persistence category Cwith the property that the
persistence modules hom C(A, B)have barcodes with finitely many bars, for all objects A, B.
In this case, assume that K ⊂ Obj(C)is a finite family of objects. We let
b#(K) = max {#(BhomC(A,B))|A, B∈ K} .
Here #(BM)is the number of bars of the barcode BMassociated to the persistence module
M. We call this the max bar count ofK.58 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
Incase CisaTPC,recallthatwehavethegradedpersistencemodules hom( X, T•Y)defined
in (13) by hom( X, T•Y)i= hom C(X, TiY), i∈Z. We define the corresponding gradedmax
bar count of Kby
b#
max(K) = max {#(BhomC(A,TiB))|A, B∈ K, i∈Z}.
We will need now a measurement related to reduced decompositions. Recall from §2.5 that
such decompositions D= (¯D, ϕ)have a linearization ℓ(D)and a weight which we denote here
by¯w(D). LetF ⊂Obj(C)invariant under shift and translation. Assume that Dis a reduced
decomposition in CofN∈Obj(C), with linearization ℓ(D) = ( X1, X2, . . . , X n), where each
Xi∈ F. We fix a bit more notation that only depends on ℓ(D):
-[D] = [X1] +···+ [Xn]∈K(C).
-{ℓ(D)}={X1, X2, . . . , X n}, this is the setof objects in the linearization of D.
-nD=n, the number of terms in the linearization of D.
We then let

max({ℓ(D)})
gap(κ([D],[D]))Dis a reduced decomposition of N
such that gap(κ([D],[D]))̸= 0
.(108)
In case no reduced decompositions Das above exist we put RF(N) =∞.
This measurement can be defined for any TPC Cbut we will apply it to the triangulated
persistence category C=CFuk(X)and for F ⊂ X.
We first state and prove the result and we will discuss its meaning in §8.2.
Theorem 8.1.4. LetC=CFuk(X)andF ⊂ Xbe as above. If N∈Obj(C)is the Yoneda
module of an embedded Lagrangian ∈ X, then:
RF(N)≥1
4.
We will give an example illustrating the theorem in §8.3. This result should be interpreted
in the sense that, if Nadmits a reduced decomposition D= (¯D, ϕ), as in the definition of
RF, then the s-isomorphism ϕis required to satisfy
s≥1
4n2
D·gap(κ([D],[D]))
b#
max({ℓ(D)})
forNto represent an embedded Lagrangian. The reason why this is of use is that the right
hand side of this inequality only depends on the linearization of D. It can be computed easily
from knowledge of HF(F, F′)as a persistence module for each F, F′∈ F. In this case the
max bar count is obvious and the gapterm is given by easy linear algebra calculations in
K(CFuk(X)). In many examples, Fforms a set of generators of [CFuk(X)]∞and the groups
HF(F, F′)are understood.PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 59
Proof of Theorem 8.1.4. Assume that r >RF(N). By inspecting the definition of reduced
decompositions in §2.5 we deduce that there are exact triangles ∆iinC0,1≤i≤k:
∆i:Fi−→Yi−1−→Yi−→TFi (109)
with Y0= 0, and an r′-isomorphism ϕ:Yk→Nsuch that
r > k2·r′b#

where [D] =P
i[Fi]andb#
max({ℓ(D)}) =b#
max({F1, F2, . . . , F k}). We denote b=b#
max{ℓ(D)}
andg= gap( κ([D],[D])). We intend to show that, because Nis embedded, we have
k2br′≥1
4g (110)
which implies the statement.
The first step is to consider the two graded persistence modules
HF′
•(N, N ) = hom C(N, T•N) and hom C(Yk, T•Yk)
and notice that they are 2r′-interleaved. This is because, by [12, Lemma 2.83], the two
modules NandYkarer′-interleaved as objects of the triangulated persistence category C
and this implies that homC(N, T•Yk)isr′-interleaved with respect to both HF′•(N, N )and
homC(Yk, T•Yk)(aspersistencemodules)whichimpliesourclaim. Thismeans, bytheisometry
Theorem in [28], that the bottleneck distance between the two barcodes B1:=BHF′•(N,N)and
B2:=BhomC(Yk,T•Yk)is at most 2r′. Recall from Lemma 8.1.1 that B1consists of only infinite
intervals of the form [0,∞). This implies that all the finite intervals in B2are of length at
most r′and all the infinite intervals in B2are of the form [x,∞)with x∈[−2r′,2r′].
The second step is to notice that −[Yk] = [F1] +. . .+ [Fk] = [D]. Thus
κ([D],[D]) =λhomC(Yk,T•Yk).
In particular, gap(κ([D],[D])) = gap( λhomC(Yk,T•Yk)). For further use, let
P=λhomC(Yk,T•Yk)=mX
i=1aitαi
and fix α′
i< α i+1such that gap(P) =αi+1−α′
iwith αi+1≥0andα′
i= max {αi,0}.
The third step is an application of the persistence Morse inequalities from §5.3 and, in
particular, the bar counting estimate from Corollary 5.3.4. That estimate implies that:
Lemma 8.1.5. We have
#(B2)≤k2b
(where, as above, B2=BhomC(Yk,T•Yk)).
Proof of Lemma 8.1.5. Recall that b=b#
max({F1, F2, . . . , F k}). By the definition of b#
max, we
have that bis the maximal number of bars in the barcodes of the graded persistence modules
HF∗(Fi, Fj)for1≤i, j≤kand∗ ∈Z. To prove the statement we will use Corollary60 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
5.3.4 and apply it repeatedly to the exact sequences from (109). To simplify notation we will
putb(M, N ) = # BhomC(M,T•N)where M, N ∈Obj(C). For each sequence from (109), and
additional module M, we deduce from Corollary 5.3.4:
b(M, Y i)≤b(M, Y i−1) +b(M, F i), b(Yi, M)≤b(Yi−1, M) +b(Fi, M).
where the second inequality can be deduced from the first one after applying the duality as
in (83) in Section 6.1. It is clear that, by taking M=Fs, we obtain:
b(Fs, Yi)≤ib , b (Yi, Fs)≤ib .
Now suppose that b(Yq, Yq)≤q2b. We want to show
b(Yq+1, Yq+1)≤(q+ 1)2b
as this concludes the proof of the lemma, by induction. We have
b(Yq, Yq+1)≤b(Yq, Yq) +b(Yq, Fq+1)≤q2b+qb
and further
b(Yq+1, Yq+1)≤b(Yq, Yq+1) +b(Fq+1, Yq+1)
≤q(q+ 1)b+ (q+ 1)b= (q+ 1)2b.
This concludes the proof of the lemma. □
We now return to the proof of the theorem for the final part of the argument. Assume that
4k2br′< g
and we will show that this leads to a contradiction. Here kis at least 1andbis at least 2.
This is because the max bar count of a family of exact Lagrangians is at least the number of
bars in BHF(L,L)for some L∈ Xand this contains at least 2bars. Thus
g≥8r′.
Recall that there is a total of k2b-many bars in B2=BhomC(Yk,T•Yk), and each finite one is of
length at most r′. We will call the values of the ends of the intervals in B2the spectral values
ofB2.
We focus on the spectral values that belong to Hδ= [αi+1−δ, αi+1+δ]with 0≤δ≤g
2.
We have αi+1−δ−r′≥g/2−r′≥3r′. As a result, only the ends of finite intervals can be
inHδ+r′(recall that the infinite intervals [x,∞)have x∈[−2r′,2r′]). Also, if a finite interval
J∈B2has an end in Hδ, then J⊂Hδ+r′. For each Hδwe consider the polynomial P′
δdefined
as in formula (12) but taking into account only the intervals that have at least one end in Hδ.
This means that if B2=L
jIj⊕L
hJhwhere Ijare finite intervals Ij= [uj, vj)andJhare
the infinite intervals, then:
P′
δ=X
j(−1)qjϵδ(Ij)(tuj−tvj).PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 61
Here qjis the degree of Ijin the graded barcode B2andϵδ(Ij) = 1if at least one of u, vis in
Hδandϵδ(Ij) = 0otherwise. Because only finite intervals contribute to P′
δ, we have P′
δ(1) = 0.
Notice that if we truncate P′
δto a polynomial Pδconsisting of only the terms of P′
δof the form
atα,a∈Zand with α∈Hδ, then Pδ=aitαi+1. It is clear that the number of terms in P′
δis at
least that of Pδ. The fact that Pδ(1) = ai+1andP′
δ(1) = 0implies that P′
δhas strictly more
terms than Pδ, where within these extra terms, there is at least one term in the form of atα
with α∈[αi+δ, αi+δ+r′)orα∈(αi−δ−r′, αi−δ]. Since Pδ+r′(1) = ai+1, this extra term
atαhas to be cancelled in P′
δ+r′, which implies that:
#B2(Hδ+r′)>#B2(Hδ) (111)
where #B2(Hδ)denotes the number of the intervals in B2that have at least one end in Hδ.
Given that k2br′≤g
2we apply (111) to deduce the sequence of strict inequalities:
#B2(Hk2br′+r′)>#B2(Hk2br′)> . . . > #B2(Hr′)>#B2(H0)≥1.
The existence of this sequence contradicts the fact that the total number of intervals in B2is
at most k2b. □
8.2.Immersed Lagrangians. We will explain here how the statement of Theorem 8.1.4
provides an estimate on how much energy is needed to resolve the singularities of certain
immersed Lagrangians.
The immersed Lagrangians in question are (unobstructed) marked immersed Lagrangians
that geometrically coincide with a union of elements in ¯F. To be more precise, let ¯F1, . . . , ¯Fk⊂
¯F. Recall that ¯Xare the elements of Xwith the primitives and gradings forgotten, and the
same for ¯F. For L∈ Xwe denote by ¯Lthe corresponding element of ¯X. By hypothesis the
family ¯Xis in general position. Thus, geometrically, the union ¯L=∪i¯Fihas only double
points (to simplify the discussion we assume that there are no repetitions among the ¯Fi’s).
A marked immersed Lagrangian - in the sense of [7] - with underlying geometric Lagrangian
¯L- is a quadruple L= (¯L, hL, θL, IL)where hL,θLare a primitive and a grading, as in the
embedded case, and ILis a subset of the self-intersection points of ¯L. Under certain conditions
imposed on IL- see again [7] where this class of immersed Lagrangians is discussed in detail
- such a Lagrangian represents a twisted complex TL∈ C′Fuk(X)of the form
TL= (kM
i=1ΣαiFi[ki], δ)
for some differential δ. The αiandkihere are determined by the choice of ILand the initial
primitives and gradings on the Fi’s.
A resolution of the singularities of ¯Lis a choice of a set ILof points of self-intersection of
L(as well as of primitive and grading) and an embedded Lagrangian N⊂ Xtogether with
anr-isomorphism in CFuk(X):
ϕ:TL→N .62 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
By unwrapping the various definitions, the statement of the corollary implies that
r≥1
4k2·gap(κ(⊕i[ΣαiFi],⊕i[ΣαiFi]))
b#
max({F1, . . . , F k}).
As mentioned before, the right side of this inequality is often approachable.
Of course, neglecting any reference to immersed Lagrangians, we can talk directly about re-
solvingthesingularitiesofatwistedcomplex T∈ C′Fuk(X)oftheform T= (⊕k
i=1ΣαiFi[ki], δ)
and the estimate above applies. This fits very well with the notion of reduced decomposition
that was used before in the definition of the number RF.
Remark 8.2.1.(i) One geometric source for a resolution of the singularities of ¯Lin the sense
above is a surgery of ¯Lat the points in IL, followed by a Hamiltonian homotopy. This is
not quite so immediate to show because once the surgery at only someof the self intersection
points of ¯Lis performed, one is left with an immersed Lagrangian that may be unobstructed
but no longer a union of embedded components and, thus, no longer approachable with the
Fukaya type machinery discussed till now. It is expected that marked immersed Lagrangians
that are unobstructed can be included in a family like Xabove and used as objects of a
filtered Fukaya category Fukimm(X;P). The construction of this Fukimm(X;P), such as to
allow in Xmarked, immersed, unobstructed Lagrangians that are not unions of embedded
components, is somewhat delicate. The non-filtered version appears in [7] but the adjustment
of the filtered construction from [12, Chapter 3] requires some additional effort that will not
be pursued here.
(ii)Assuming Fukimm(X;P)defined, webrieflymentionacoupleofpropertiesofthepairing
κfor the resulting TPC, CFukimm(X). If a class A∈K(CFukimm(X))is represented by an
immersed Lagrangian L(with only transverse double points), then (compare with Corollary
8.1.2):
(a)κ(A, A)(t) = (−1)nκ(A, A)(t−1);
(b) the number of self intersection points of Lhas as lower bound N+[κ(A, A)]where for
a polynomial P=Pkitαi∈ΛP,ki∈Z,αi∈R, we have N+[P] =P
αi>0|ki|.
Both properties follow from the cluster, or pearly, model of Floer homology for immersed,
unobstructed Lagrangians L. In this model the generators of the Floer complex CF(L,L)
are of two types: critical points of a Morse function on the domain of the immersion and self-
intersection points of the immersion. Each self-intersection point appears twice, with opposite
action levels (see [1], [7]).
8.3.An example. The aim here is to illustrate how Corollary 8.1.2 and Theorem 8.1.4 can
be applied.
Consider the exact symplectic manifold Xobtained from the plumbing of two cotangent
bundles of S1as in Figure 1, where Z0(in blue) is the zero-section of one (horizontal) T∗S1
andY(in green) is a Lagrangian in the other (vertical) T∗S1, perturbed from its zero-section.
We orient Z0in the counterclockwise orientation and Yin the clockwise orientation (withPERSISTENCE K-THEORY 63
respect to how these two Lagrangian are depicted in Figure 1), so that the intersection index
ofZ0, Yaty′is+1. Next we fix a Liouville form λonXfor which both Z0andYare exact.

Figure 1. A plumbing of two T∗S1where Z0andYare two embedded Lagrangians.
In what follows we will view Z0andYas marked Lagrangians and denote by ¯Z0and ¯Y
their underlying Lagrangians. We will shortly be a bit more specific regarding the marking
ofZ0andY, namely the grading and the choice of primitives for the Liouville form on these
Lagrangians. Let ¯Xbe any collection of exact Lagrangians in Xthat contains ¯Z0and¯Yand
such that ¯Xsatisfies the conditions from §2.6.2. For the family Xwe take, as before, the
Lagrangians in ¯Xtogether with all their possible markings (i.e. we endow each Lagrangian
¯L∈¯Xwith all possible primitives of λ|¯Land all possible grading).
Recall from §2.6 that in our realization of the Fukaya category we take Floer data with 0
Hamiltonians for pairs of Lagrangians that intersect transversely. This applies in particular
toZ0andY, hence the Floer complex CF∗(Z0, Y)is generated by the intersection points
between Z0andY, which are y′, x, y′′.
We endow Z0andYwith gradings such that:
|y′|=|y′′|= 0,and|x|= 1,
where | · |stands for homological grading. It follows that the Floer complex (with Z2-
coefficients) has the following form:
CF0(Z0, Y) =Z2y′⊕Z2y′′, dy′=dy′′= 0,
CF1(Z0, Y) =Z2x, dx =y′+y′′.(112)64 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
We now turn to the action filtration on the Floer complex. We choose primitives for λ|¯Z0
andλ|¯Ysuch that the actions of the intersection points of Z0∩Yare given by:
A(y′) =A(y′′) = 0 ,A(x) =a, (113)
where ais the area depicted in Figure 1.
It follows that the persistence Floer homology HF∗(Z0, Y)is concentrated in degree 0and
moreover the persistence module HF 0(Z0, Y)has the following barcode:
BHF0(Z0,Y))=
[0, a),[0,∞)	
. (114)
We denote the resulting filtered Fukaya category by Fuk(X;P)- see §2.6.2.
Consider a surgery of Z0∪Yaty′, so that the outcome Lagrangian is represented by the
immersed Lagrangian Sϵ(depicted in red) in Figure 2, with two self-intersection points x,y′′.
Here ϵis the area of the surgery handle used in the surgery at y′(see [27, 24, 5] for a detailed
description of surgery.) Note that Sϵis an exact immersed Lagrangian (this is always the case
when we perform surgery of two exact Lagrangians at a single point). Since the choices of
the primitives of λ|¯Z0andλ|Ycoincide at y′(recall that A(y′) = 0) we can endow Sϵwith a
primitive induced by those of Z0andY(more precisely, one needs to parametrize Sϵby an
immersion j:ˆS−→Xwith j(ˆS) =Ssuch that j∗λis exact and define the primitive of the
latter 1-form on ˆS). We also perturb slightly this Sϵby a small Hamiltonian perturbation of
Hofer norm at most ϵ′thus getting S=Sϵ,ϵ′that intersects transversely all the elements in
¯X.
It can easily be seen that Sis unobstructed (in the sense that it carries no pseudo-
holomorphic teardrops (see also [7])). Therefore, Sgives rise to a filtered A∞-module over
Fuk(X), which we denote by S. The existence of this module requires in fact elements of the
theory of immersed Fukaya category mentioned in Remark 8.2.1 (ii), however only the most
elementary part of this theory is needed here. In essence, because Sis unobstructed we can
include Sin a larger family X′that contains XandS. We may still define a Fukaya filtered
category associated to X′,Fuk(X′;P′). The immersed Lagrangian Snow gives a (filtered)
Yoneda module Y(S)overFuk(X′;P′). The perturbation data P′can be picked to be admis-
sible also for the set Xand there is an embedding Fuk(X;P′)→ Fuk(X′;P′)such that Y(S)
pulls back to a module over Fuk(X;P′). Finally, using that Fuk(X)is independent of the
perturbation data up to filtered quasi-equivalence, we can pull-back this module to the module
SoverFuk(X;P). The details of this process appear in [12, Chapter 3, Theorem 3.12], but
only in the case when Sis embedded. The modifications needed for our Shere are easy to
implement as in [7] (where is covered the construction of non-filtered, Fukaya type categories
with immersed objects in much larger generality), and noting that the construction there of
the Floer complexes of the type CF(S, S),CF(S, X),CF(X, S)(forX∈ X) produces filtered
structures, and similarly for the higher A∞-operations.
Next, consider the twisted complex (over Fuk(X)) defined as the mapping cone
C:=Cone (Z0y′
− →Y) (115)PERSISTENCE K-THEORY 65
S

of the morphism y′∈homFuk(X)(Z0, Y) =CF0(Z0, Y). (Recall that y′is a cycle). Since y′
has filtration level 0and both Z0,Yare filtered twisted complexes, Ccan be endowed with
the structure of a filtered twisted complex ∈ C′Fuk(X)⊂ CF uk(X)in the standard way.
We claim that S∈ CF uk(X)and that there exists an r-isomorphism
ϕ:C→S
such that r=r(ϵ, ϵ′)tends to 0when both ϵandϵ′go to 0.
To prove this we compare Y(S)andCover the category Fuk(X′;P′), and we notice the
existence of an r-isomorphism
¯ϕ:C→ Y(S)
of the form µ2(α,−)for an appropriate intersection point αbetween SandZ0∪Y. To see
this we can interpret C=Y(S′)where S′is a marked immersed Lagrangian, in the sense
discussed in §8.2, with obvious primitive and grading, and with a marked point IC={y′}. At
this point it is also useful to use the ϵ′-small Hamiltonian perturbation to be a bit special, in
essence associated to a Morse function with two critical points on ˆSand in this case αis the
intersection point between Sϵ,ϵ′andS′that corresponds to the maximum of this function. By
pulling back ¯ϕoverFuk(X)we get ϕ.
We now pass to calculations in the K-group K(CFuk(X)). We have:
[C] =−[Z0] + [Y]∈K(CFuk(X)). (116)66 PAUL BIRAN, OCTAV CORNEA AND JUN ZHANG
Next we compute the pairing κ([C],C]). By linearity, and by Theorem 8.1.2 we obtain:
κ([C],[C]) =κ([Y],[Y]) +κ([Z0],[Z0])−κ([Y],[Z0]))−κ([Z0],[Y])
=−χ(Y)−χ(Z0)−λHF∗(Z0,Y)(t) +λHF∗(Z0,Y)(t−1)
= 0 + 0 −(1−ta+ 1) + (1 −t−a+ 1)
=−t−a+ta,(117)
where the third equality comes from the barcode data (114) and the identities in Theo-
rem 8.1.2.
Since κ([C],[C])is not a constant, by Corollary 8.1.2, the class [S] = [C]∈K(CFuk(X))
cannot be represented by any Lagrangian in X.
Further, we now want apply Theorem 8.1.4. First , the data before provide a reduced
resolution Dof weight rofSwith linearization ℓ(D) = (T−1Y, Z 0).
Clearly, [D] =−[C]sogap(κ([D],[D])) = a. Obviously nD= 2. It is also immediate to
calculate b#
max({T−1Y, Z 0}) = 2. We fix F={T−1Y, Z 0}. Thus, we obtain
RF(S)≤8r
a.
Theorem 8.1.4 implies that if r=r(ϵ, ϵ′)≤a
16, then Ccan not represent an embedded
Lagrangian (in the sense that it is not the Yoneda module of an element in X). Moreover,
this result is independent of the set Xas long as Xcontains Z0, Y.
Another way to apply Theorem 8.1.4 is to deduce by an argument very similar to the above
that, assuming that both ϵandϵ′are very small, then the Hofer norm of a Hamiltonian
homotopy needed to deform Sinto an embedding is at leasta
16.
Remark 8.3.1.As noted in relation to the constant 4in Theorem 8.1.4, the constant 16here is
not optimal. In essence, the argument we discussed is very general but it produces constants
that can be easily improved in our example. In this example it is possible to use a Hamiltonian
homotopy of energy ato deform Sinto an embedding and it is likely that this is sharp.
