Abstract This study delves into equilibrium problems, focusing on the iden-

Recognizing situations where the solution set may not exhibit weak sh arpness,
we propose an augmented mapping approach to mitigate this limitation . The
core of our research is the formulation of augmented weak sharpn ess for the

1 Introduction
In this paper, we explore the equilibrium problem denoted as EP(φ,S):
Find ¯x∈Ssuch that φ(¯x,y)≥0,∀y∈S,
whereS⊂Rnis a closed convex set, and φ:Rn×Rn→Ris a function such
that
φ(x,x) = 0,∀x∈S. (1)
Let
¯S={x∈S|φ(x,y)≥0,∀y∈S} /\e}atio\slash=∅
be the solution set of EP(φ,S) and
˜S={x∈S| ∃u∈∂yφ(x,x),such that /a\}b∇acketle{tu,y−x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥0,∀y∈S}
is the stationary points set of EP(φ,S), where∂yφ(x,x) is generalized sub-
diﬀerential at xofφ(x,·) ([[22]. Deﬁnition 8.3]), or sub-diﬀerential for short.
The relation between ¯Sand˜Sis discussed, where it is noted that while the
general relation
¯S⊆˜S (2)
does not always hold, under certain conditions, such as lower semi-c ontinuity
ofφ(x,·) and the satisfaction of ( BCQ) constraint qualiﬁcation in ¯S, this
inclusion is established. This condition is particularly valid when φ(x,·) is
locally Lipschitzian or convex on Rn.
The model EP(φ,S) serves as a uniﬁed model encompassing various opti-
mization problems, including mathematical programming,variational inequal-
ity,Nashequilibrium, andsaddlepointproblems,forexample,[3, 4, 9, 10].The
study extends to vector optimization problems, demonstrating th e versatility
ofEP(φ,S). Previous research eﬀorts have expanded the model to include
generalized quasi-variational inequality problems. The concept of e quilibriumThe augmented weak sharpness of solution sets in equilibriu m problems 3
problem plays a central role in various applied sciences, such as phys ics, eco-
nomics, engineering, transportation, sociology, chemistry, biolog y, and other
ﬁelds [13, 15, 19]. The theory of gap functions, developed in the var iational
inequalities, is extended to a general equilibrium problem in [18]. Van et a l.
[25] provide suﬃcient conditions and characterizationsfor linearly c onditioned
bifunction associated with an equilibrium problem.
Regardingthe ﬁnite terminationofalgorithmsfor EP(φ,S), particularlyin
mathematical programming and variational inequality problems, exis ting re-
search has predominantly concentrated on concepts such as wea k sharp min-
imum and strong non-degeneracy of the solution set. Pioneering st udies by
scholars like Rockafellar [23], Polyak [21], Ferris [12], and others have la id
down conditions for ﬁnite termination utilizing speciﬁc algorithms. Non ethe-
less, the reliance on algorithmic frameworks has highlighted the nece ssity for
more expansive research into conditions that ensure ﬁnite termina tion, irre-
spectiveofthealgorithmsemployed.Earlysigniﬁcantcontributions inthisarea
were made by Burke and Mor´ e[7], who established necessary and suﬃcient
conditions for the ﬁnite termination of feasible solution sequences in smooth
programming problems that converge to strongly non-degenerat e points. Sub-
sequently, Burke and Ferris [5] broaden these ﬁndings to encomp ass diﬀer-
entiable convex programming. In a further extension, Marcotte a nd Zhu [17]
generalize these principles to continuous variational inequality prob lems char-
acterized by pseudo-monotonicity+. Al-Homidan et al. [1] consider weak sharp
solutions for the generalized variational inequality problem, in which t he un-
derlying mapping is set-valued. Huang et al. [14] give several chara cterizations
of the weak sharpness in terms of the primal gap function associat ed with
the mixed variational inequality. Nguyen [20] presents the concept of weak
sharpness in variational inequality problems, speciﬁcally within the co ntext
of Hadamard spaces. Subsequently, numerous researchers hav e explored the
concept of weak sharpness of the solution set, particularly focus ing on its
implications for the ﬁnite convergence of diverse algorithms applied t o vari-
ational inequality problems. This topic has been extensively investiga ted in
various studies, as detailed in references [2, 16, 29, 30], among oth ers.
This paper introduces and elaborates on the concepts of weak sha rpness
andstrongnon-degeneracyofthesolutionsetwithintheframewo rkofEP(φ,S).
To tackle scenarios where these characteristics are not present , we propose an
augmented mapping on the solution set. This leads to the deﬁnition of aug-
mented weak sharpness of the solution set for feasible solution seq uences. This
novel concept not only generalizes weak sharpness and non-dege neracy but is
also employed in establishing necessary and suﬃcient conditions for t he ﬁnite
termination of feasible solution sequences under the premise of aug mented
weak sharpness.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provide s
preliminaries and discusses several special cases of EP(φ,S). In Section 3,
the notion of augmented weak sharpness is introduced for the solu tion set of
EP(φ,S) under general conditions. Section 4 presents examples illustratin g
situations where weak sharpness or non-degeneracy is not satisﬁ ed, but aug-4 Ruyu Wang et al.
mented weak sharpness holds. Section 5 establishes the ﬁnite ident iﬁcation
of feasible solution sequences under the condition of augmented we ak sharp-
ness and presents consequences, generalizing results from cond itions of weak
sharpness or strong non-degeneracy. We make a conclusion in Sec tion 6.
2 Preliminary
In this section, we introduce fundamental concepts and speciﬁc c ases relevant
toEP(φ,S), laying the groundwork for subsequent discussions.
Consider an inﬁnite sequence N⊆ {1,2,···}and setsCk⊂Rnfork=
1,2,···. Deﬁne the upper limit and lower limit of the sequence of sets as
follows:
limsup
k→∞Ck={x∈Rn| ∃N, xk∈Ck,such that lim
k∈N,k→∞xk=x},
liminf
k→∞Ck={x∈Rn| ∃xk∈Ck,such that lim
k→∞xk=x}.
Thus we have
liminf
k→∞Ck⊆limsup
k→∞Ck.
LetC⊂Rn,¯x∈C. The tangent cone for Cat ¯xis deﬁned as
TC(¯x) ={d∈Rn| ∃xk∈C,xk→¯x,τk↓0,(k→ ∞),with lim
k→∞(xk−¯x)/τk=d}.
The regular normal cone for Cat ¯xis deﬁned as
ˆNC(¯x) ={d∈Rn| /a\}b∇acketle{td,x−¯x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≤o(/ba∇dblx−¯x/ba∇dbl),x∈C}.
Ingeneralmeaning,thenormalconefor Cat ¯xisdeﬁnedas NC(¯x) = limsup
xk∈C,xk→¯xˆNC(xk).
The polar cone of Cis deﬁned as C◦={y∈Rn| /a\}b∇acketle{ty,x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≤0,∀x∈C}. By
[[22], Proposition 6.5], we have TC(x)◦=ˆNC(x). WhenCis convex, by [[22],
Theorem 6.9], we have
NC(¯x) =ˆNC(¯x) ={d| /a\}b∇acketle{td,x−¯x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≤0,∀x∈C}.
The projection of a point x∈Rnover a closed set Cis deﬁned as
PC(x) = argmin
y∈C/ba∇dbly−x/ba∇dbl,
while the distance from x∈RntoCis given by dist( x,C) = inf
y∈C/ba∇dbly−x/ba∇dbl. If
Cis a closed set, then dist( x,C) =/ba∇dblPC(x)−x/ba∇dbl.
Suppose the subdiﬀerential of ψ(·) atx∈Csatisﬁes∂ψ(x)/\e}atio\slash=∅. Then the
projected sub-diﬀerential of ψ(·) atxis
PTC(x)(−∂ψ(x)) ={PTC(x)(−u)|u∈∂ψ(x)}.The augmented weak sharpness of solution sets in equilibriu m problems 5
Ifψ(·) is continuously diﬀerentiable in a neighborhood of point x∈C, by
[[22], Exercise 8.8], we have ∂ψ(x) ={∇ψ(x)}, which means the projected
sub-diﬀerential is the projected gradient PTC(x)(−∇ψ(x)).
We call that a sequence {xk} ⊂Rnterminates ﬁnitely to Cif there exists
k0such thatxk∈Cfor allk≥k0. InEP(φ,S), we callφis monotonic on
S×S, ifφ(x,y)+φ(y,x)≤0, for∀(x,y)∈S×S. A function φis said to be
pseudo-monotone on S×S, ifφ(x,y)≥0 =⇒φ(y,x)≤0, for∀(x,y)∈S×S.
Below we give several special cases of EP(φ,S) (see [4]).
Example 1 Let
φ(x,y) =f(y)−f(x),(x,y)∈Rn×Rn, (3)
wheref:Rn→R. Obviously, φsatisﬁes (1). Then EP(φ,S) is the following
mathematical programming problem:
(MP) Find ¯ x∈S⊆Rn,such that f(¯x)≤f(y),∀y∈S.
By (3),φis monotonic over Rn×Rn.
Example 2 Let
φ(x,y) =/a\}b∇acketle{tF(x),y−x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht,(x,y)∈S×S, S⊆Rn, (4)
whereF:S→Rn. Obviously, φsatisﬁes (1). Then EP(φ,S) is the following
variational inequality problem:
(VIP) Find ¯ x∈S,such that /a\}b∇acketle{tF(¯x),y−¯x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥0,∀y∈S.
By (4), we know φis monotonic on S×S⇐⇒Fis monotonic on S, andφis
pseudo-monotonic on S×S⇐⇒Fis pseudo-monotonic over S.
Example 3 SupposeS=S1×S2,S1⊆Rn1,S2⊆Rn2, (n1+n2=n) are
all nonempty closed convex sets, x= (x1,x2)∈Rn1×Rn2,y= (y1,y2)∈
Rn1×Rn2.Let
φ(x,y) =ϕ(y1,x2)−ϕ(x1,y2),(x,y)∈Rn×Rn, (5)
whereϕ:Rn→R. Obviously, φsatisﬁes (1). Then EP(φ,S) is the following
global saddle point problem:
(SPP) Find ¯ x= (¯x1,¯x2)∈S1×S2,such that ϕ(¯x1,y2)≤ϕ(¯x1,¯x2)≤ϕ(y1,¯x2),
∀(y1,y2)∈S1×S2.
By (5),φis monotonic over Rn×Rn.
Example 4 LetI={1,2,···n},S=Πi∈ISi,Si⊆R(i∈I) be nonempty
closed convex sets. For x= (x1,x2,···,xn)∈Rn, deﬁne
xi= (x1···xi−1,xi+1,···,xn)
with the obvious modiﬁcations for the cases i= 1 andi=n.6 Ruyu Wang et al.
Suppose
φ(x,y) =Σi∈I(fi(xi,yi)−fi(x)),(x,y)∈Rn×Rn, (6)
wherefi:Rn→R. Obviously, φsatisﬁes (1). Then EP(φ,S) is the following
Nash equilibrium problem:
(NEP) Find ¯ x∈S,such that fi(¯x)≤fi(¯xi,yi),∀yi∈Si,for alli∈I.
3 The augmented weak sharpness in the equilibrium problem
In this section, we present the notions of weak sharpness and str ong non-
degeneracy for the solution set ¯S⊂SofEP(φ,S). Furthermore, in order
to provide a more relaxed conditions on the ﬁnite identiﬁcation of a fe asible
solution sequence, we introduce an augmented mapping over the so lution set
¯S, and establish the concept of augmented weak sharpness for the solution
set¯Son feasible solution sequence. Under several diﬀerent cases and v ery
general assumptions, we prove that this new concept is a generaliz ation of
weak sharpness and strong non-degeneracy.
First, we give the concept of weak sharp minimum in mathematical pro -
gramming (see [6, 11])
Deﬁnition 1 In mathematical programming ( MP), the solution set ¯S⊂S
is weak sharp minimal, if there exists a constant α>0, such that for ∀x∈¯S,
we have
f(y)−f(x)≥α·dist(y,¯S),∀y∈S. (7)
The constant αand the set ¯Sare called the modulus and domain of sharpness
forfoverS, respectively. Clearly, ¯Sis a set of global minima for foverS.
If (MP) is a non-smooth convex programming, then ¯Sis a weak sharp
minimal set with the module α, if and only if
αB⊂∂f(x)+[TS(x)∩N¯S(x)]◦,∀x∈¯S, (8)
whereBis a unit ball (see [[6], Theorem 2.6, c]).
If (MP) is a smooth convex programming, then ¯Sis a weak sharp minimal
set with the module α, if and only if
−∇f(¯x)∈int/intersectiondisplay
x∈¯S[TS(x)∩N¯S(x)]◦,∀¯x∈¯S, (9)
(see [[6], Corollary 2.7, c)]). Here, in the case that fis smooth, (9) and (8) are
equivalent, as ∇f(·) is a constant vector on ¯S(see [[5], Corollary 6]).
To generalize the characteristics of the solution set into variationa l in-
equalities and the smooth non-convex programming problems, some literature
([17, 26, 27, 32, 33]) utilize (9) to deﬁne the weak sharpness of the solution set
in these two kinds of problems. Now we use (8) to deﬁne the weak sha rpness
of the solution set ¯SofEP(φ,S).The augmented weak sharpness of solution sets in equilibriu m problems 7
Deﬁnition 2 In theEP(φ,S), for∀x∈S,∂yφ(x,x)/\e}atio\slash=∅, the solution set
¯S⊂Sis said to be a weak sharp set with the module α, if there exists a
constantα>0, such that
αB⊂∂yφ(x,x) +[TS(x)∩ˆN¯S(x)]◦,∀x∈¯S. (10)
Remark 1 In (10), we have used ˆN¯S(·) instead of N¯S(·), since in general, ¯Sis
not necessarily convex. When ¯Sis non-convex, according to [[22], Proposition
6.5],ˆN¯S(·) is a closed convex cone, while N¯S(·) is only a closed cone, and it
holds that
ˆN¯S(·)⊆N¯S(·).
When¯Sis convex, according to [[22], Theorem 6.9], the formula above holds
inequality. So we can obtain
[TS(x)∩N¯S(x)]◦⊆[TS(x)∩ˆN¯S(x)]◦.
Therefore, ˆNS(·) makes the conditions of Deﬁnition 2 more relaxed.
Next, we introduce the notion of strong non-degeneracy in EP(φ,S).
Deﬁnition 3 In theEP(φ,S), suppose φ(x,·) is diﬀerentiable at each xin
S. We call ¯S⊂Sis strongly non-degenerate, if
−∇yφ(¯x,¯x)∈intNS(¯x),∀¯x∈¯S, (11)
and ¯xis said to be a strongly non-degenerate point.
Now we give the main notion in this paper.
Deﬁnition 4 In theEP(φ,S), suppose ¯S⊂Sis a closed set. For any x∈S,
there is∂yφ(x,x)/\e}atio\slash=∅, and{xk} ⊂S.We call ¯Sis augmented weak sharp
with respect to {xk}. For an inﬁnite sequence K={k|xk/∈¯S}, there exists
an augmented mapping (set-valued mapping) H:¯S→2Rnsuch that the
following hold:
(a) there exists a constant α>0, such that
αB⊂H(z)+[TS(z)/intersectiondisplayˆN¯S(z)]◦,∀z∈¯S,
(b) for∀uk∈∂yφ(xk,xk) and∀vk∈H(P¯S(xk)), it holds that

3.1 The non-smooth case
Proposition 1 In theEP(φ,S), suppose ¯S⊂Sis a closed set, ∂yφ(x,x)/\e}atio\slash=∅
for anyx∈S, and∂yφ(x,x)is monotonic over S. If¯Sis weakly sharp, then
for every {xk} ⊂S,¯Sis augmented weakly sharp.
ProofLetK={k|xk/∈¯S}be an inﬁnite sequence. Set
H(z) =∂yφ(z,z),∀z∈¯S.
By (10) we know that ( a) in Deﬁnition 4 holds, and (b) also holds by the
monotonicity of ∂yφ(x,x).
Thefollowingpropositionprovidesasuﬃcient conditionforthe monot onic-
ity of∂yφ(x,x).
Proposition 2 In theEP(φ,S), suppose that φsatisﬁes the following condi-
tions:
(i)For∀x∈S,φ(x,·)is convex function over Rn,
(ii)The function φis monotonic (pseudo-monotonic) over S×S.
Then∂yφ(x,x)is monotonic (pseudo-monotonic) over S.
ProofBy (i) we have∂yφ(x,x)/\e}atio\slash=∅, for∀x∈S. Now setux∈∂yφ(x,x),uz∈
∂yφ(z,z). Suppose φis monotonic over S×S. Then we have
0≥φ(x,z)+φ(z,x)
=φ(x,z)−φ(x,x)+φ(z,x)−φ(z,z) [by(1)]
≥ /a\}b∇acketle{tux,z−x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht+/a\}b∇acketle{tuz,x−z/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht[by(i)]
=/a\}b∇acketle{tux−uz,z−x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht,
i.e.,∂yφ(x,x) is monotonic over S. Supposeφis pseudo-monotonic over S×S.
If
/a\}b∇acketle{tux,z−x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥0,
then we can get
φ(x,z) =φ(x,z)−φ(x,x)
≥ /a\}b∇acketle{tux,z−x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥0.
Therefore, according to the pseudo-monotonicity of φ, it holds that
0≥φ(z,x) =φ(z,x)−φ(z,z)≥ /a\}b∇acketle{tuz,x−z/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht,
i.e.,∂yφ(x,x) is pseudo-monotonic over S.
Remark 2 The following two examples show that the two assumptions in

Example 5 In theEP(φ,S), letφ(x,y) =ex−y−ey−xandS= [0,1].Then
∇yφ(x,x) is monotonic over S, whileφ(x,·) is non-convex over S, for∀x∈
[0,1).
Example 6 InEP(φ,S), letφ(x,y) =ey2−x2−1 andS=R. Then∇yφ(x,x)
is monotonic over S, whileφis not non-monotonic over S×S.
We note that [[5], Theorem 5] gave the characteristic description fo r the so-
lution set of a non-smooth convex programming. The result in [[5], The orem
5] not only contributes to the understanding of the nature of the solution set
of convex programming, but also plays an important role in the analys is of
the weak sharp minimality of the solution set in convex programming. S o next
this result is generalized to the solution set of EP(φ,S), and further apply it
to the analysis on the weak sharpness of the solution set of EP(φ,S).
Theorem 1 InEP(φ,S), suppose that φsatisﬁes the following conditions:
(i)For∀x∈S,φ(x,·)is a convex function over Rn.
(ii)For∀x,z∈¯S, there isφ(x,y) =φ(z,y),∀y∈Rn.
Furthermore, suppose ¯x∈¯S, andAis a convex set satisfying ¯S⊆A⊆S.
Then we have
¯S={x∈S|∂yφ(x,x)∩(−NS(x)) =∂yφ(¯x,¯x)∩(−NS(¯x))}(12)
={x∈A|∂yφ(x,x)∩(−NS(x)) =∂yφ(¯x,¯x)∩(−NS(¯x))}.(13)
ProofLet
ˆS={x∈S|∂yφ(x,x)∩(−NS(x)) =∂yφ(¯x,¯x)∩(−NS(¯x))}.
Next we only need to prove that (12) holds, i.e., ¯S=ˆS. SinceAsatisﬁes
¯S⊆A⊆S, withSreplaced with Ain (12), (13) yields immediately. We ﬁrst
prove¯S⊆ˆS. Let ˆx∈¯S. According to ( i) we have∂yφ(ˆx,ˆx)/intersectiontext(−NS(ˆx))/\e}atio\slash=∅.
Take ˆu∈∂yφ(ˆx,ˆx)/intersectiontext(−NS(ˆx)), we can immediately have ˆ u∈∂yφ(ˆx,ˆx), and
/a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,x−ˆx/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥0,∀x∈S. (14)
Since ˆx,¯x∈¯S, according to ( ii) andφ(x,x) = 0, we get φ(ˆx,¯x) =φ(¯x,¯x) = 0.
Thus by a combination of ( i) and (14) we obtain that
0 =φ(ˆx,¯x)−φ(ˆx,ˆx)≥ /a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,¯x−ˆx/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥0.
Therefore,
/a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,¯x−ˆx/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht= 0. (15)
For∀y∈Rn, According to ( i), (ii) and (15), we immediately obtain that
φ(¯x,y)−φ(¯x,¯x) =φ(ˆx,y)−φ(ˆx,ˆx)
≥ /a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,y−ˆx/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
=/a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,y−¯x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht+/a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,¯x−ˆx/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
=/a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,y−¯x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht.10 Ruyu Wang et al.
So ˆu∈∂yφ(¯x,¯x), and according to (14), (15), we obtain that
/a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,x−¯x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,x−ˆx/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht+/a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,ˆx−¯x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
=/a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,x−ˆx/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥0
holds for ∀x∈S, i.e., ˆu∈ −NS(¯x). Thus
∂yφ(ˆx,ˆx)∩(−NS(ˆx))⊆∂yφ(¯x,¯x)∩(−NS(¯x)).
Since ¯x,ˆxare selected from ¯Sarbitrarily, the inverse inclusion relation of the
above relationship also holds. Therefore, ¯S⊆ˆS.
Now we prove ˆS⊆¯S. Assume ˆx∈ˆS.Sinceφ(¯x,¯x)/intersectiontext(−NS(¯x))/\e}atio\slash=∅, then
∂yφ(ˆx,ˆx)/intersectiontext
(−NS(ˆx))/\e}atio\slash=∅.Taking ˆu∈∂yφ(ˆx,ˆx)/intersectiontext(−NS(ˆx)), for∀y∈Swe have
φ(ˆx,y) =φ(ˆx,y)−φ(ˆx,ˆx)
≥ /a\}b∇acketle{tˆu,y−ˆx/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥0,
i.e., ˆx∈¯S,ˆS⊆¯S.
Remark 3 For the convex programming problem ( MP), the speciﬁc case of
equilibrium problem EP(φ,S), by Example 1, ( i),(ii) obviously hold. But
in fact, (i),(ii) hold not only for the convex programming in EP(φ,S). For
example, when φ(x,y) = (1−x2)(y−x),S= [−1,1], (i), (ii) also hold
obviously.
Let

we have the following proposition.
Proposition 3 Under the assumptions of Theorem 1, and furthermore sup-
pose that ¯S⊂Sis closed,∂yφ(x,x)is monotonic over S. If

(−NS(x))⊂intGfor∀x∈¯S, (16)
then¯Sis augmented weakly sharp for all {xk} ⊂S.
ProofFirst, by the assumption ( i) in Theorem 1 and [[24], Theorem 23.4],
we get that ∂yφ(x,x) is a nonempty compact set for ∀x∈Rn. Furthermore,
by Theorem 1, we obtain that ∂yφ(x,x)/intersectiontext(−NS(x)) is a nonempty compact
constant set over ¯S. So by (16), there exists a constant α >0 such that for
∀x∈¯S,
αB−∂yφ(x,x)∩(−NS(x))⊂[TS(x)∩[ˆN¯S(x)]◦.
From the formula above, for ∀x∈¯S, we get that
αB⊂∂yφ(x,x)∩(−NS(x))+[TS(x)∩[ˆN¯S(x)]◦
⊂∂yφ(x,x) +[TS(x)∩[ˆN¯S(x)]◦.

If¯Sis weak sharp, then ¯Sis augmented weakly sharp with respect to {xk}.
ProofLetK={k|xk/∈¯S}be an inﬁnite sequence, and set
H(z) =∇yφ(z,z),∀z∈¯S.
By (10), we know that ( a) holds in Deﬁnition 4, and by (17), we immediately
obtain that

i.e., (b) holds in Deﬁnition 4.
Proposition 5 InEP(φ,S), suppose ¯S⊂Sis a closed set, {xk} ⊂S,
{∇yφ(xk,xk)}is bounded and any one of its accumulations ¯psatisﬁes −¯p∈
intG. Then¯Sis augmented weakly sharp with respect to {xk}.
ProofLetK={k|xk/∈¯S}be an inﬁnite sequence. According to the hy-
potheses, there must be an accumulation ¯ pof{∇yφ(xk,xk)}k∈Ksatisfying
−¯p∈intG, i.e., there exists a constant α>0 such that
αB⊂¯p+[TS(z)∩ˆN¯S(z)]◦,∀z∈¯S. (18)
LettingH(z) = ¯p,∀z∈¯S, by (18) we know that ( a) holds in Deﬁnition 4.
Furthermore let K0⊆Ksuch that
lim
k∈K0,k→∞∇yφ(xk,xk) = ¯p. (19)
By (19), we immediately get that
limsup

/ba∇dblxk−P¯s(xk)/ba∇dbl/a\}b∇acketle{t∇yφ(xk,xk)−¯p,xk−P¯S(xk)/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
= 0,
i.e., (b) holds in Deﬁnition 4.
Finally, we give the relation ofstrong non-degeneracyand augment ed weak
sharpness.12 Ruyu Wang et al.
Proposition 6 In theEP(φ,S), suppose ∇yφ(x,x)is continuous over S,
{xk} ⊂Sis bounded and any of its accumulations is strongly non-dege nerate.
Then¯Sis augmented weakly sharp with respect to {xk}.
ProofLetK={k|xk/∈¯S}be an inﬁnite sequence. Then there must be an
accumulation point ¯ xof{xk}k∈K. SupposeK0⊆Ksuch that
lim
k∈K0,k→∞xk= ¯x. (20)
By the assumptions of the strong non-degeneracy of ¯ xand the continuity of
∇yφ(x,x), and [[28], Proposition 5.1], we know that ¯ xis an isolated point of
¯S, Thus we have T¯S(¯x) ={0},ˆN¯S(¯x) =T¯S¯x)◦=Rn. Therefore, we obtain
that
[TS(¯x)∩ˆN¯S(¯x)]◦=TS(¯x)◦=NS(¯x). (21)
According to (11) and (21), we know that there exists a constant α>0 such
that
αB⊂ ∇yφ(¯x,¯x)+NS(¯x) =∇yφ(¯x,¯x)+[TS(¯x)∩ˆN¯S(¯x)]◦.(22)
Now we deﬁne the augmented mapping
H(z) =/braceleftbigg
∇yφ(¯x,¯x), z= ¯x,
Rn, z/\e}atio\slash= ¯x.(23)
According to (22) and (23), we can immediately obtain that
αB⊂H(z)+[TS(z)∩ˆN¯S(z)]◦,∀z∈¯S,
i.e., (a) holds in Deﬁnition 4. Since xis an isolated point of ¯S, by (20), for
all suﬃciently large k∈K0it holds that P¯S(xk) = ¯x. Therefore, according to
(20), (23), and the continuity of ∇yφ(x,x), we obtain that

i.e., (b) holds in Deﬁnition 4.The augmented weak sharpness of solution sets in equilibriu m problems 13
4 Some examples
In this section, we give some examples of EP(φ,S) to show that the solution
setSofEP(φ,S) does not satisfy the weak sharpnessbut the augmentedweak
sharpness.
Example 7 Considerthefollowingmathematicalprogrammingproblems( MP)
as a special case of EP(φ,S):
min
x∈Sf(x) = max{0,x1x2}+2/summationdisplay
i=1max{0,xi},
where
S={x∈R2|x1≤1, x2≤1},
¯S={x∈R2|x1= 0, x2≤0}∪{x∈R2|x1≤0, x2= 0}.
This is a non-smooth and non-convex programming problem, and the solution
set¯Sof it is non-convex. By Example 1, we know that
φ(x,y) =f(y)−f(x),(x,y)∈R2×R2.
Therefore,∂yφ(x,·) =∂f(·).Now, let (t)+= max{0,t}.
Whenx∈S\¯S, we have
∂f(x1,x2) =

(x2+(x1
|x1|)+,x1+(x2
|x2|)+),ifx1x2>0

/bardblx/bardbl,x2+1],ifx1x2= 0
u2∈[x2
/bardblx/bardbl,x1+1]},andx1+x2>0.(24)
Whenx∈¯S, we have
∂f(x1,x2) =

{u∈R2|u1∈[0,1],u2∈[0,1]},ifx= (0,0)
{u∈R2|u1∈[x2,1],u2= 0},ifx1= 0, x2<0.
{u∈R2|u1= 0,u2∈[x1,1]},ifx1<0, x2= 0.(25)
Note that ¯S⊂intS, for allx∈¯S, we haveTS(x) =R2. So, for ∀x∈¯S, we
get that
[TS(x)∩ˆN¯S(x)]◦=ˆN¯S(x)◦
=

{ξ∈R2|ξ1≤0,ξ2≤0}, ifx= (0,0)
{ξ∈R2|ξ1= 0,ξ2∈(−∞,+∞)},ifx1= 0, x2<0
{ξ∈R2|ξ1∈(−∞,+∞),ξ2= 0},ifx1<0, x2= 0(26)
By (25), the second and third formula of (26), we obtain that
∂f(x)+ˆN¯S(x)◦=/braceleftbigg{ξ∈R2|ξ1∈[x2,1],ξ2∈(−∞,+∞)},ifx1= 0, x2<0
{ξ∈R2|ξ1∈(−∞,+∞),ξ2∈[x1,1]},ifx1<0, x2= 0.(27)14 Ruyu Wang et al.
By (27) we know that the model α >0 is not a constant in Deﬁnition 2,
which is related to x∈¯S, and when /ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl →0,α→0+, i.e., the constant α>0
does not exist. Therefore, ¯Sis not a weak sharp set.
Now, take small enough ε>0, and let
Ωε={x∈R2|−ε<x1<0,−ε<x2<0}.
Below we will prove that ¯Sis an augmented weak sharp set with respect
to arbitrary sequences {xk} ⊂S\Ωε. LetK={k|xk/∈¯S}be an inﬁnite
sequence. We introduce the augmented mapping H:¯S⇒R2as follows:
H(x1,x2) =

(ε,ε), ifx= (0,0)
{v∈R2||v1|≤ε,v2= 0},ifx1= 0, x2<0.
{v∈R2|v1= 0,|v2|≤ε},ifx1<0, x2= 0.(28)
According to (26), (28), and the conditions ( a) in Deﬁnition 4 holds, i.e.,
there exists a constant α>0 such that for all x∈¯S,
αB⊂H(x)+ˆN¯S(x)◦.
Fork∈K, let
ψk=1
/ba∇dblxk−P¯S(xk)/ba∇dbl/a\}b∇acketle{tuk−vk,xk−P¯S(xk)/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht,
whereuk∈∂f(xk),vk∈H(P¯S(xk)), and
P¯S(xk) =

According to (24), (28), and (29), we can easily prove that {xk}k∈K⊂
S\Ωεsatisﬁes the condition ( b) in Deﬁnition 4. For simplicity, we only prove
the casethat {xk}k∈Klies inthe thirdquadrant.At thesametime, considering
xk/∈Ωε, we have
(i) whenxk
2≤xk
1<0 andxk
2≤ −ε, by the ﬁrst item of (24), (29), and the
second item of (28), we have

By (i),(ii), we get that
limsup
k∈K, k→∞ψk≥0,The augmented weak sharpness of solution sets in equilibriu m problems 15
i.e., (b) in Deﬁnition 4 holds.
In addition, we note that Remark 1 is veriﬁed through Example 7. As in
this example, the regular normal cone of ¯Sat (0,0) is
ˆN¯S(0,0) ={ξ∈R2|ξ1≥0,ξ2≥0},
while the normal cone under the general meaning is
N¯S(0,0) =ˆN¯S(0,0)∪{ξ∈R2|ξ1∈(−∞,0),ξ2= 0}∪{ξ∈R2|ξ1= 0,ξ2∈(−∞,0)}.
Here,N¯S(0,0) is a closed cone, but not a convex cone. Furthermore, accordin g
toTS(0,0) =R2, it follows that
[TS(0,0)∩ˆN¯S(0,0)]◦=ˆN¯S(0,0)◦={ξ∈k2|ξ1≤0,ξ2≤0},
[TS(0,0)∩N¯S(0,0)]◦=N¯S(0,0)◦={(0,0)}.
The advantage of the regular cone has been shown here compared with the
normal cone under the general meaning.
Example 8 Consider the following variational inequality problem VIP(F,S)
as a special case of EP(φ,S):
F(x) = (cosx1,ex2),
whereS={x∈R2|0≤x1≤π
2,x2≥0},¯S={(0,0),(π
2,0)}. By Example 2,
we haveφ(x,y) =/a\}b∇acketle{tF(x),y−x/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht,(x,y)∈R2×R2. Then, we have ∂yφ(x,·) =
F(x).
Whenx∈¯S, we have
F(x) =/braceleftbigg(1,1), x= (0,0)
(0,1), x= (π
2,0),(30)
and
[TS(x)∩N¯S(x)]◦=NS(x) =/braceleftbigg
{ξ∈R2|ξ1≤0,ξ2≤0}, x= (0,0)
{ξ∈R2|ξ1≥0,ξ2≤0}, x= (π
2,0).(31)
This is a non-monotonic variational inequality problem. By (30) and (3 1),
one can see that ¯Sis not a weak sharp set.
Next, we will prove that ¯Sis an augmented weak sharp set with respect to
the sequence {xk} ⊂Swhich satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i){xk} ⊂ {x∈R2|x1≤π
4}∪{x∈R2|x1≥π
4,x1+x2≥π
2};
(ii) lim
k→∞dist(xk,¯S) = 0.
For this purpose, let K={k|xk/∈¯S}be an inﬁnite sequence. Take
λ∈(0,1
2), we introduce the augmented mapping H:¯S→R2as follows:
H(x) =/braceleftbigg(λ,λ),ifx= (0,0)
(−λ,λ),ifx= (π
2,0).(32)16 Ruyu Wang et al.
By (31) and (32), we obtain that the condition ( a) in Deﬁnition 4 holds.
Now, fork∈K, let
ψk=1
/ba∇dblxk−P¯S(xk)/ba∇dbl/a\}b∇acketle{tF(xk)−H(P¯S(xk)),xk−P¯S(xk)/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht,
where
P¯S(xk) =/braceleftbigg(0,0),ifxk

By the condition ( ii), the accumulations of the bounded sequence {xk}k∈K
are only possibly ¯ x= (0,0) or ¯x= (π
2,0). Without loss of generality, let ¯ x=
(π
2,0) be one of its accumulations. Then there exists an inﬁnite subsequ ence
K0⊆Ksuch that
lim
k∈K0,k→∞xk= (π
2,0). (34)
According to (32), (33), and (34), when k∈K0is big enough, we obtain
that

2),
S=S1×S2= [0,1]×[−1,1], and¯S={(0,1),(0,−1)}.
By Example 3, one can see that this is a saddle point problem ( SPP), i.e.,
ﬁnd ¯x= ( ¯x1,¯x2)∈S1×S2such that
ϕ(¯x1,y2)≤ϕ(¯x1,¯x2)≤ϕ(y1,¯x2),∀(y1,y2)∈S1×S2,

By (36) and (37), one can see that ¯Sis not a weak sharp set and that ¯Sis
not a strongly non-degenerate set.
Next, we will prove that ¯Sis an augmented weak sharp set with respect to
the sequence {xk} ⊂Swhich satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i){xk} ⊂ {x∈R2|x1+|x2| ≤1};
(ii) lim
k→∞dist(xk,¯S) = 0.
For this purpose, let K={k|xk/∈¯S}be an inﬁnite sequence. Take

H(x) =/braceleftbigg
(λ,−λ),ifx= (0,1)
(λ,λ),ifx= (0,−1).(38)
By (37) and (38), we obtain that the condition ( a) in Deﬁnition 4 holds.
Now we will prove the condition ( b) in Deﬁnition 4 also holds. By ( ii) one can
see that the accumulations of {xk}are ¯x= (0,1) or ¯x= (0,−1). Without loss
of generality, assume that there exists a sequence k0⊆Ksuch that
lim
K∈K0,k→∞xk= (0,1). (39)
Fork∈K, let
ψk=1

where

According to (35), (38), (39), and (40), when k∈K0is big enough, we

S=S1×S2= [0,1]×[0,1],¯S={(0,0)},¯x= (0,0).By Example 4, one can
see that this is a Nashequilibrium problem ( NEP), i.e., ﬁnd ¯x∈Ssuch that
f1(¯x)≤f1(y1,¯x2),∀y1∈S1,
f2(¯x)≤f2(¯x1,y2),∀y2∈S2,

[TS(0,0)∩N¯S(0,0)]◦=NS(0,0) ={ξ∈R2|ξ1≤0, ξ2≤0}.(43)
By (42) and (43), we obtain that ¯Sis not a weak sharp set, i.e., the point
(0,0) is not a strongly non-degenerate point.
Now we will prove that ¯Sis an augmented weak sharp set for arbitrary
sequences {xk} ⊂S∩ {x∈R2|x2≤x1}. For this purpose, let K={k|
xk/∈¯S}be an inﬁnite sequence. Take λ∈(0,1
2), we introduce the augmented
mappingH:¯S→R2as follows:
H(0,0) = (λ,λ). (44)
By (43) and (44), one can see that the condition ( a) in Deﬁnition 4 holds.
Furthermore, according to (41) and (44), for k∈K, we obtain that

The following example has certain characteristics.

Note that ¯Sis convex, we have

{ξ∈R2|ξ1≤0, ξ2∈(−∞,∞)},ifx1= 0,−1≤x2<0.(46)

Accordingto (46) and (47), we obtain that ¯Sis a weaksharp set. Furthermore,
if we assume {xk} ⊂S, then

Deﬁne the mapping H(x) =∂f(x) over¯S, and then it is easy to prove that
¯Sis an augmented weak sharp set with respect to the sequence {xk}which
satisﬁes the condition lim
k→∞dist(xk,¯S) = 0.
It is worthwhile to note that by modifying the mapping ∂f(·) we can prove
¯Sis augmented weak sharp with respect to arbitrary {xk} ⊂S. For this
purpose, let K={k|xk/∈¯S}be an inﬁnite sequence. Taking λ∈(0,cosπ

we introduce the augmented mapping H:¯S→R2as follows:
H(x) =/braceleftbigg(λ,λ),ifx= (0,0)

According to (46) and (49), one can see that the condition ( a) in Deﬁnition

whereuk∈∂f(xk),vk∈H(P¯S(xk)). By (45), (48), and (49), We immediately

In this section, under the condition that the solution set ¯SofEP(φ,S) is
augmented weak sharp with respect to {xk} ⊂S, we present the condition
of ﬁnite identiﬁcation of {xk}(see Theorem 2). Applying the result to four
special cases of EP(φ,S) (see Examples 1-4), we derive a series of results
for ﬁnite identiﬁcation of feasible solution sequences in these cases . In the
ﬁrst two special cases, i.e., the mathematical programming and var iational
inequalities problems, these results are generalizations of the corr esponding
results in the literature under the condition that ¯Sis weakly sharp or strongly
non-degenerate. In the last two special cases, i.e., the saddle poin t andNash
equilibrium problems, the ﬁnite identiﬁcation problems of feasible solut ion
sequences have not been studied by other authors in the literatur e.The augmented weak sharpness of solution sets in equilibriu m problems 21
Theorem 2 In theEP(φ,S), let¯S⊂Sbe a closed set, and for ∀x∈
S,∂yφ(x,x)/\e}atio\slash=∅,¯Sis augmented weak sharp with respect to {xk} ⊂S. So the
following conclusions are established.
(i) Suppose (2)holds. If {xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, then we have
0∈liminf
k→∞PTS(xk)(−∂yφ(xk,xk)). (50)
(ii) If(50)holds, then {xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S.
Proof(i) Ifxk∈¯S, then by (2), we know that there exist uk∈∂yφ(xk,xk)
such that −uk∈NS(xk). Therefore by the convexity of Sand projective
decomposition, we have that PTS(xk)(−uk) = 0, i.e., (50) holds.
(ii) Suppose (50) holds. Now we prove that {xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S.
If not, then K={k|xk/∈¯S}is an inﬁnite sequence. According to that ¯S
is augmented weakly sharp with respect to {xk} ⊂S, there exist a mapping
H:¯S→2R2and a constant α>0 such that
αB⊂H(z)+[TS(z)∩ˆN¯S(z)]◦,∀z∈¯S, (51)
and for∀uk∈∂yφ(xk,xk),vk∈H(P¯S(xk)), we have
limsup
k∈K, k→∞1
/ba∇dblxk−P¯S(xk)/ba∇dbl/a\}b∇acketle{tuk−vk,xk−P¯S(xk)/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥0. (52)
Letzk=P¯S(xk). Then for ∀z∈¯Swe have /ba∇dblzk−xk/ba∇dbl2≤ /ba∇dblz−xk/ba∇dbl2, and
/a\}b∇acketle{txk−zk,z−zk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≤1
2/ba∇dblz−zk/ba∇dbl2=◦(/ba∇dblz−zk/ba∇dbl).
Therefore, by the deﬁnition of ˆN¯S(·) we obtain that
xk−zk∈ˆN¯S(zk). (53)
Furthermore, by the convexity of S, we have
xk−zk∈TS(zk), zk−xk∈TS(xk). (54)
According to (53) and (54), we immediately get that
xk−zk∈TS(zk)∩ˆN¯S(zk). (55)
Letgk=xk−zk
/bardblxk−zk/bardbl(k∈K).By (51) one can see that there exists ¯ vk∈
H(zk),¯ξk∈[TS(zk)∩ˆN¯S(zk)]◦such that for ∀k∈K. We have
αgk= ¯vk+¯ξk. (56)
By (55) and (56), for ∀k∈Kwe obtain that
α=/a\}b∇acketle{t¯vk,gk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht+/a\}b∇acketle{t¯ξk,gk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≤ /a\}b∇acketle{t¯vk,gk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht. (57)22 Ruyu Wang et al.
On the other hand, from (50) one can see
0∈liminf
k∈K, k→∞PTS(xk)(−∂yφ(xk,xk)).
Therefore, there exists ¯ uk∈∂yφ(xk,xk) such that
lim
k∈K, k→∞PTS(xk)(−¯uk) = 0. (58)
Using (54), (57), and the properties of the projected gradient ( [[8], Lemma
3.1]), we immediately get that
α≤ /a\}b∇acketle{t¯vk,gk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
=/a\}b∇acketle{t−¯uk,−gk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht−/a\}b∇acketle{t¯uk−¯vk,gk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht

=/ba∇dblPTS(xk)(−¯uk)/ba∇dbl−/a\}b∇acketle{t¯uk−¯vk,gk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht.
According to (52) and (58),
α≤liminf
k∈K, k→∞{/ba∇dblPTS(xk)(−¯uk)/ba∇dbl−/a\}b∇acketle{t¯uk−¯vk,gk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht}
=−limsup
k∈K, k→∞/a\}b∇acketle{t¯uk−¯vk,gk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≤0,
which leads to a contradiction. The proof is complete.
Applying Theorem 2 to the special cases (Examples 1-4) of EP(φ,S), we
can obtain the following corollaries.
Corollary 1 The following conclusions hold.
(1) In the (MP), suppose that ¯S⊂Sis a closed set, ∂f(x)/\e}atio\slash=∅for∀x∈S,
and¯Sis augmented weak sharp with respect to {xk} ⊂S. So the following
conclusions are established.
(i)Suppose that (2)holds. If {xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, then we have
0∈liminf
k→∞PTS(xk)(−∂f(xk)). (59)
(ii) If(59)holds, then {xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S.
(2) In theVIP(F,S), suppose that ¯S⊂Sis a closed set, ¯Sis augmented weak
sharp with respect to {xk} ⊂S. Then{xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯Sif and only
if
lim
k→∞PTS(xk)(−F(xk)) = 0. (60)
(3) In the (SPP), suppose that ¯S⊂Sis a closed set, for ∀x∈S,∂ϕ(x)/\e}atio\slash=∅,¯Sis
augmented weakly sharp with respect to {xk} ⊂S. So the following conclusions
are established.
(i) Suppose that (2)holds. If {xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, then we have
0∈liminf
k→∞PTS(xk)((−∂y1ϕ(xk),∂y2ϕ(xk))). (61)The augmented weak sharpness of solution sets in equilibriu m problems 23
(ii) If(61)holds, then {xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S.
(4) In the (NEP), suppose that ¯S⊂Sis a closed set, ∂yifi(x)/\e}atio\slash=∅for∀x∈S
andi∈I={1,2,..,n},¯Sis augmented weak sharp with respect to {xk} ⊂S.
So the following conclusions are established.
(i) Suppose that (2)holds. If {xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, then we have
0∈liminf
k→∞PTS(xk)(−(∂yifi(xk),i∈I)). (62)
(ii) If(62)holds, then {xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S.
Next, we apply Theorem 2 to a kind of important function, i.e., for ∀x∈
S,φ(x,·) is locally Lipschitzian function on Rn. For this function, by [[22],
Theorem 9.13 and Theorem 8.15], we know (2) is established, and ∂yφ(x,x)/\e}atio\slash=
∅. Therefore by Theorem 2, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 2 In theEP(φ,S), suppose that ¯S⊂Sis a closed set, for ∀x∈
S,φ(x,·)is locally Lipschitzian, ¯Sis augmented weak sharp with respect to
{xk} ⊂S, then{xk} ⊂Sterminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, if and only if (50)holds.
By Corollary 2 and Proposition 1, we immediately get the following corol-
lary.
Corollary 3 In theEP(φ,S), suppose ¯S⊂Sis a closed set, φ(x,·)is locally
Lipschitzian function on Rnfor∀x∈S, and∂yφ(x,x)is monotone over S. If
¯Sis a weak sharp set, then {xk} ⊂Sterminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, if and only if
(50)holds.
Remark 4 By Remark 2, one can see that the monotonicity of ∂yφ(x,x) does
not imply the convexity of φ(x,·), and the reverse is also true. For example,
φ(x,y) =x2y−x3,(x,y)∈R×R.
Notice that a ﬁnite convex function on Rnis locally Lipschitzian, therefore
by Corollary 3 and Proposition 2, we immediately get the following corolla ry.
Corollary 4 In theEP(φ,S), suppose ¯S⊂Sis a closed set, for ∀x∈S,
φ(x,·)is convex function on Rn, andφ(·,·)is monotonic over S×S. If¯Sis
a weak sharp set, then {xk} ⊂Sterminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, if and only if (50)
holds.
For the special cases (Examples 1-3) of EP(φ,S), we have the following
corollaries.
Corollary 5 The following conclusions are established.
(1) In the convex programming (MP), suppose ¯S⊂Sis a weak sharp
minimal set. Then {xk} ⊂Sterminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, if and only if (59)
holds.
(2) In theVIP(F,S), supposeF(·)is monotonic over S,¯S⊂Sis a closed
and weak sharp set. Then {xk} ⊂Sterminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, if and only if
(60)holds.
(3) In the (SPP), for∀x2∈S2,ϕ(·,x2)is a convex function over Rn1; for
∀x1∈S1,ϕ(x1,·)is a concave function over Rn2, and¯S⊂Sis a weak sharp
set. Then {xk} ⊂Sterminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, if and only if (61)holds.24 Ruyu Wang et al.
ProofAccording to the hypotheses in (1) and (2), one can see that they all
meet the hypotheses conditions of Corollary 3. For (3), by its hypo theses and
(5), one can see that the hypotheses conditions of Corollary 4 are satisﬁed. So
we immediately get that these conclusions (1)-(3) hold.
Remark 5 Corollary 5 (1) is equivalent to [[33], Theorem 3.1].
By Corollary 2 and Proposition 3, we can obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 6 Under the hypothesis in Theorem 1, and suppose ¯S⊂Sis closed
and∂yφ(x,x)is monotonic over S. If for∀x∈¯S,
−∂yφ(x,x)∩(−NS(x))⊂intG,
then{xk} ⊂Sterminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, if and only if (50)holds.
Since the convex programming ( MP), as a special case of EP(φ,S), satisﬁes
the hypotheses in Corollary 6, we can obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 7 Suppose that in the convex programming (MP), it holds that for
∀x∈¯S,
−∂f(x)∩(−NS(x))⊂intG.
Then{xk} ⊂Sterminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, if and only if (59)holds.
Remark 6 Corollary 7 is a generalization of [[6], Theorem 4.7] in the smooth
convex programming, and in Corollary 7, the two hypotheses about {xk}and
∇f(·) in [[6], Theorem 4.7] are removed.
Next, we consider the smooth situation, the case that φ(x,·) is locally Lip-
schitzian. Therefore, by Proposition4 and Corollary2, we obtain th e following
corollary.
Corollary 8 In theEP(φ,S), suppose ¯S⊂Sis a closed set, and {xk} ⊂S
satisﬁes (17). If¯Sis weak sharp, then {xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, if and
only if
lim
k→∞PTS(xk)(−∇yφ(xk,xk)) = 0. (63)
By Proposition 5 and Corollary 2, we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 9 In theEP(φ,S), suppose ¯S⊂Sis a closed set, and {xk} ⊂S,
{∇yφ(xk,xk)}is bounded and any of its accumulation ¯psatisﬁes −¯p∈intG.
Then{xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, if and only if (63)holds.
Remark 7 In the special cases VIP(F,S) ofEP(φ,S), Corollary 9 is a gen-
eralization and improvement of [[33], Theorem 3.3], i.e., [ TS(x)∩N¯S(x)]◦in
[[33], Theorem 3.3] is replaced with [ TS(x)∩ˆN¯S(x)]◦, and the assumption of
the continuity of F(·) is removed. It is worthwhile to note that [[33], Theorem
3.3] has ever improved [[32], Theorem 3.2].The augmented weak sharpness of solution sets in equilibriu m problems 25
By Proposition 6 and Corollary 2, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 10 In theEP(φ,S), suppose ∇yφ(x,x)is continuousover S,{xk} ⊂
Sis bounded and any of its accumulation is strongly non-degen erate. Then
{xk}terminates ﬁnitely to ¯S, if and only if the (63)holds.
Remark 8 In the smooth programming problems ( MP), a special case of
EP(φ,S), Corollary 10 is just [[27], Theorem 5.3], and the latter is an ex-
tension of [[7], Corollary 3.5].
By Theorem 2 and a series of its corollaries,one can see that, under normal
conditions, the weak sharpness or strong non-degeneracy of th e solution set is
a special case of the augmented weak sharpness with respect to t he feasible
solution sequence. On the other hand, for some algorithms in mathe matical
programming and variational inequalities, for example, the proximal point
algorithm, the gradient projection algorithm and the SQPalgorithm and so
on (see [7, 8, 21, 26, 27, 31, 32]), the projected gradient of the p oint sequence
generated by them all convergeto zero, i.e. (50) holds. Therefor e, the notion of
augmented weak sharpness of the solution set presented by us pr ovides weaker
suﬃcient conditions than the weak sharpness or strong non-dege neracyfor the
ﬁnite termination of these algorithms.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, a novel concept concerning the solution set of equilib rium prob-
lems has been introduced, namely, the augmented weak sharpness of the solu-
tion set. This concept extends the traditional notions of weak sha rpness and
strong non-degeneracy in relation to feasible solution sequences. We have es-
tablished that the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the ﬁnite termination
of feasible solution sequences are met when the lower limit of the proj ected
sub-diﬀerential sequence, associated with the feasible solution se quence, en-
compasses the zero point. This ﬁnding has led to the derivation of se veral
signiﬁcant corollaries. Additionally, the augmented weak sharpness of the so-
lution set presents a suﬃcient condition for the ﬁnite termination of certain
equilibrium problem algorithms and their speciﬁc variants, such as mat hemat-
ical programmingproblems, variational inequality problems, Nash eq uilibrium
problems, and global saddle point problems. This condition is less strin gent
than the traditional criteria of weak sharpness and strong non-d egeneracy.
