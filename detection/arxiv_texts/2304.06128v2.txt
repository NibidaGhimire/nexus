Abstract —In this paper, a stochastic geometry based analytical
framework is proposed for secure simultaneous transmittin g
and reﬂecting reconﬁgurable intelligent surface (STAR-RI S)
assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmiss ions,
where legitimate users (LUs) and eavesdroppers are randoml y
distributed. Both the time-switching protocol (TS) and ene rgy
splitting (ES) protocol are considered for the STAR-RIS. To
characterize system performance, the channel statistics a re ﬁrst
provided, and the Gamma approximation is adopted for genera l
cascaded κ-µfading. Afterward, the closed-form expressions for
both the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and average secre cy
capacity (ASC) are derived. To obtain further insights, the
asymptotic performance for the secrecy diversity order and the
secrecy slope are deduced. The theoretical results show tha t 1)
the secrecy diversity orders of the strong LU and the weak LU
depend on the path loss exponent and the distribution of the
received signal-to-noise ratio, respectively; 2) the secr ecy slope
of the ES protocol achieves the value of one, higher than the s lope
of the TS protocol which is the mode operation parameter of TS .
The numerical results demonstrate that: 1) there is an optim al
STAR-RIS mode operation parameter to maximize the secrecy
performance; 2) the STAR-RIS-NOMA signiﬁcantly outperfor ms
the STAR-RIS-orthogonal multiple access.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Reconﬁgurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been re-
garded as a promising technique to support the smart radio
environment and efﬁcient secure transmissions in future co m-
munication networks [2]–[4]. One typical RIS is a uniform
planer array with a large number of low-cost elements. By
equipping with advanced beamforming controllers, the phas e
shifts of reﬂected signals on each RIS element can be changed
independently, which helps to adjust the propagation of sig nals
[5]. Beneﬁting from this feature, the RIS is able to improve
the communication quality of legitimate users (LUs) while
limiting eavesdropping by appropriate design on beamformi ng
[6], thereby enhancing physical layer security (PLS).

Part of this work has been accepted in IEEE Global Communicat ions
Conference (GLOBECOM), 2023 [1].For the conventional reﬂecting-only RIS, PLS performance
within half of the space in front of the RIS can be con-
trolled, while the LUs in another half of the space still suff er
from uncontrollable eavesdropping. To address this issue,
the concept of simultaneous transmitting and reﬂecting RIS
(STAR-RIS) has been proposed [7], [8]. With three operation
protocols, i.e., time switching (TS), energy splitting (ES ), and
mode switching [7], different beamforming approaches can
be implemented at both sides of the STAR-RIS, and hence
the full-space PLS enhancement is realized. Note that STAR-
RISs serve LUs at different sides by the same signal source,
a multiple access scheme is indispensable for splitting uni cast
reﬂected and transmitted signals. The non-orthogonal mult iple
access (NOMA) scheme can be a competent candidate due to
its high spectral efﬁciency and user fairness. By employing the
superposition coding at the transmitter for power multiple xing
and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the r e-
ceiver for detection, STAR-RIS-NOMA protects multiple LUs
within the same time-frequency resource block [9], [10].
A. Related Works
Due to the broadcast nature of wireless communications, the
concept of PLS was proposed from an information-theoretica l
perspective [11] and has attracted wide attention in recent
years. In general, PLS leverages the inherent characteris-
tics of the propagation environment (e.g., fading, noise, a nd
interference) to provide secure transmissions. One common
method is to employ the jamming and artiﬁcial noise (AN)
aided technique to depress the wiretapping of the potential
eavesdroppers (Eves) [12], [13]. By deploying jammers that
emit jamming signals to confuse the Eves, the information
loss due to eavesdropping can be reduced. Another popular
method is to improve the received signal quality at the LUs
and to reduce the information leakage to the Eves with the
aid of multi-antenna technology [14], [15]. Therefore, it i s
natural to use the RIS which is a passive multi-antenna devic e
for PLS enhancement. The authors of [16] focused on a
challenging case in downlink RIS-assisted secure transmis sion,
where the Eve has better channel conditions than the LU.
The design of beamforming is based on the global channel
state information (CSI) of the Eve and the LU. In [17],
the authors proposed a novel design on RIS beamforming
to eliminate the signals received by the Eve, and hence
the global CSI of the Eve is required. In [18], the secrecy
data rate in a RIS-aided massive multiple-input multiple-
output system was studied and the statistical CSI of the Eve2
was considered. These works assumed that the perfect CSI
of the Eve is known for beamforming design. In practice,
however, it is difﬁcult to acquire perfect knowledge of the
CSI of the eavesdropping channels because potential Eves ar e
not continuously communicating with the BS and are even
passive to hide their existence. In [19], the authors utiliz ed
the imperfect CSI of the Eves to jointly design the transmit
beamformers, AN covariance matrix, and RIS phase shifters.
In [20], the theoretical SOP was derived under the assumptio n
that Eve’s CSI is unknown. The above works investigated
PLS in the presence of ﬁxed LUs and Eves. To capture
the randomness property in the considered space, stochasti c
geometry is a powerful tool [21] and has been widely utilized
to study the PLS in traditional communication systems [22],
[23]. The authors in [24] considered the spatial effect in a R IS-
assisted multiple-input multiple-output system and model ed
the locations of LUs by a homogeneous Poisson point process
(HPPP). Then the theoretical secrecy performance expressi ons
were derived.
Sparked by the potential advantages of combining STAR-
RIS and NOMA, research contributions have been devoted
to STAR-RIS-NOMA recently. In [25], the authors focused
on the coverage performance and illustrated the superiorit y of
NOMA over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in STAR-RIS-
aided transmissions. In [26], bit error rate expressions we re
derived in STAR-RIS-NOMA and the results revealed that the
STAR-RIS-NOMA outperforms the classical NOMA system
in terms of error performance. The authors in [27] solved
a joint optimization problem for maximizing the achievable
sum rate. Simulation results demonstrated the better perfo r-
mance of STAR-RIS-NOMA than the conventional RIS-aided
transmissions. Works [28] and [29] investigated the theore tical
performance of STAR-RIS-NOMA in large-scale networks. In
[28], the authors proved that for three STAR-RIS operation
protocols, the accurate diversity orders depend on the numb er
of STAR-RIS elements that form the passive beamforming.
In [29], a general analytical framework was provided for the
multi-cell networks, where LUs, BSs, and STAR-RISs are
randomly distributed. Furthermore, a few works started to p ay
attention to the PLS in STAR-RIS-NOMA. In [30], the authors
focused on the AN-assisted downlink transmission for the
improved secrecy rate. In [31], residual hardware impairme nts
were considered and analytical expressions of the SOP were
provided for the paired NOMA LUs. In [32], the authors aimed
to maximize the minimum secrecy capacity in STAR-RIS-
aided uplink NOMA networks by joint secrecy beamforming
design. However, these initial works considered simpliﬁed
settings with ﬁxed eavesdropping as the location of the Eve i s
predeﬁned.
B. Motivations and Contributions
As we have discussed, although STAR-RIS-NOMA has the
capability of providing full-space security enhancement, the
impact of eavesdropping from the full space needs to be
investigated. The security performance of STAR-RIS-NOMA
transmissions considering randomly distributed Eves in th e full
space is important but has not been studied in previous work
to our knowledge. Motivated by the above, in this work, wefocus on the theoretical security performance of the STAR-
RIS-NOMA in the presence of randomly distributed LUs and
Eves.1The main contributions are summarized as follows:
•We propose an analytical framework for STAR-RIS-
NOMA in terms of PLS, where both LUs and Eves
are randomly deployed. In this framework, the paired
NOMA LUs are randomly selected from two sides of
the STAR-RIS, and the distribution of Eves is modeled
by a HPPP. A mapping method is introduced for unifying
the performance at different sides of the STAR-RIS. The
beamforming of the STAR-RIS is designed to enhance the
channels of LUs. Moreover, a general κ-µdistribution is
used to characterize the small-scale fading.
•We derive the analytical expressions of the SOP for the
NOMA LUs when the CSI of Eves is unavailable at
the BS. The ordering channel statistics are obtained by
exploiting the Gamma distribution to ﬁt the cascaded
small-scale fading of STAR-RIS-aided links. We further
derive the asymptotic SOP expressions in the high signal-
to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. The analytical results show
that the secrecy diversity order for the strong LU is related
to the path loss exponent while the error ﬂoor exists for
the weak LU in the considered scenario.
•We derive the analytical expressions of the average se-
crecy capacity (ASC) performance for the NOMA LUs
when the CSI of Eves is available at the BS. The
asymptotic ASC is also derived to obtain the secrecy
slope. The analytical results demonstrate that the secrecy
slopes for the ES protocol and the TS protocol are one
and the mode operation parameter of TS, respectively,
and hence the ES protocol outperforms the TS protocol
in ASC performance when the SNR is high.
•We use the numerical results to validate the analysis and
to show that: 1) there is an optimal STAR-RIS mode
operation parameter to maximize the SOP performance
and the ASC; 2) the secrecy performance of the ES
protocol always outperforms that of the TS protocol in
the considered system; 3) NOMA is able to achieve the
higher ASC than the OMA in the STAR-RIS-assisted
transmission.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, the system model of the secure STAR-RIS-aided
NOMA networks is introduced. In Section III, we derive the
theoretical SOP for the pair of NOMA LUs, and then the
secrecy diversity order is investigated. In section IV , we d erive
the theoretical ASC and then obtain the secrecy slope. The
numerical results are presented in Section V . Finally, we dr aw
the conclusions in Section VI.

II. S YSTEM MODEL
As shown in Fig. 1, we consider a secure downlink trans-
mission scenario, where a BS communicates with LUs assisted
by a STAR-RIS in the presence of Eves. The STAR-RIS with a
random orientation is ﬁxed at the origin of a two-dimensiona l
planeR2. We ﬁx the BS at (−lBR,0), while the locations
of LUs obey a HPPP Φuwithin a disc area with radius
RUcentered at the origin. The spatial distribution of Eves
is modeled by another HPPP Φewith the density λein the
considered plane.2We consider that the BS, LUs, and Eves
are equipped with a single antenna. The STAR-RIS consists of
Nelements, and these elements are capable of simultaneously
transmitting and reﬂecting signals.
Those LUs located at the same side of the STAR-RIS as
the BS are the reﬂecting LUs; otherwise the transmitting LUs .
We randomly select a reﬂecting LU URand a transmitting
LUUTto form a typical LU pair. The NOMA transmission
scheme is invoked for the typical LU pair. All Eves have
powerful detection capabilities and are able to overhear th e
messages of all available resource blocks. Moreover, multi user
detection techniques are adopted at Eves, and the Eves can
distinguish signals of different LUs when applying the NOMA
scheme. For tractable theoretical expressions, simple set ups are
employed, and all assumptions are concluded as follows.
Assumption 1: We consider an urban environment for the
secure STAR-RIS-NOMA transmission, so all direct transmis -
sion links between the BS and LUs/Eves are blocked.
Assumption 2: The STAR-RIS is antenna empowered and
has the capability of independently controlling the transm itted
and reﬂected signals [35].
Assumption 3: The STAR-RIS is a planar antenna array. We
assume that the inter-antennas spacing is volume-unlimite d,
and the angle difference of the signal transmitted and recei ved
can be neglected. In this case, we approximately regard that
channel gains of Ndifferent channels are independently and
identically distributed [36].
A. Channel Model
In this work, we mainly focus on the STAR-RIS-aided links
between the BS and LUs/Eves. The channel model of the
considered STAR-RIS-aided transmission includes the path
loss model and the small-scale fading model. For clarity, we
use the subscript ε={T,R}to denote the transmitting LU
and the reﬂecting LU, respectively. For LUs, the path loss

as the steady-state distribution in the random direction mo bility model [34].
Therefore, the LUs and Eves are moving as the random directio n model.of the STAR-RIS-aided link is related to the product of two
distances, which can be expressed as

Cris the reference distance based intercept. αrefers to the
path loss exponent. Similarly, the path loss of the Eve i∈Φe
is
Le,i=Cr(lBRde)−α. (2)
As in previous works, all channels of the STAR-RIS-aided
transmission suffer from cascaded small-scale fading. Spe ciﬁ-
cally, we denote the small-scale fading vectors of the BS-RI S
link and the RIS-LU/Eve link as hr1= [hr1,1,...,hr1,N]Tand
hr2= [hr2,1,...,hr2,N]T, respectively. For LUs, the power of
the equivalent overall small-scale fading for the STAR-RIS -
aided cascaded channel is given by |hε|2=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglehr2T˜Θεhr1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2
,
where˜Θε= diag/parenleftbig
ejθε,1,...,ejθε,N/parenrightbig
is the normalized phase-
shifting matrix of the STAR-RIS, where j=√−1and
θε,n∈[0,2π)forn∈ {1,...,N}. To maximize the received
signal power at LUs, the STAR-RIS reconﬁgures the phase
shifts according to the instantaneous exact CSI so that phas es
of all channels can be aligned at the LUs, i.e., for ε∈ {R,T}
we have
|hε|2=/parenleftBiggN/summationdisplay
n=1|hr1,n||hr2,n|/parenrightBigg2
. (3)
Different from the LUs, phases of different channels are
random and independent at the Eves. The overall small-scale
fading power is
|he|2=/parenleftBiggN/summationdisplay
n=1|hBR,n||he,n|ejθn/parenrightBigg2
, (4)
whereθnis uniformly distributed in [0,2π). In this work, the
small-scale fading is characterized by the κ-µdistribution [37],
which is a general model including some classical distribut ions
such as the Rayleigh, Nakagami- m, and Rician as special
cases. The transmission from the BS to the LUs through
the STAR-RIS element nis the double κ-µdistribution. The
probability density function of the BS-RIS link and the RIS-
LU/Eve link is respectively given by

B. STAR-RIS Operation Protocol
This work considers the TS protocol and the ES protocol
to operate the STAR-RIS. Here, We introduce these operation
protocols. Since the received signal is highly relative to t he
change of phases and amplitudes by the STAR-RIS, we
provide the transmission- and reﬂection-coefﬁcient matri xes
in two protocols.
1) Time Switching Protocol: In TS protocol, the STAR-
RIS operates in the reﬂecting mode or transmitting mode
in different time periods. Let Tεdenote the percentage of
communication time allocated to the LU ε, whereTR+TT= 1
andTε∈[0,1]. In the reﬂecting mode, the transmission-
and reﬂection-coefﬁcient matrix is ΘTS
R=˜ΘRwhile in the
transmitting mode, we have ΘTS
T=˜ΘT.
2) Energy Splitting Protocol: In ES protocol, the energy of
the signal incident on each element is split into two parts fo r
transmitting and reﬂecting with energy splitting ratios βTand
βR, respectively, and we have βR+βT= 1 according to the
law of energy conservation. We consider the same βεon all
elements of the STAR-RIS. Therefore, the transmission- and
reﬂection-coefﬁcient matrix for LU εisΘES
ε=√βε˜Θε.
In this work, we call Tεandβεthe mode operation
parameters of TS and ES, respectively.
C. Signal Model
We focus on the typical LU pair in this work. The remaining
LUs use resources that are orthogonal to the typical LU pair, so
only intra-cluster NOMA interference occurs in the conside red
system. In STAR-RIS-NOMA, the SIC process is employed as
in traditional NOMA systems. Without loss of generality, th e
SIC is employed at the LU with the better channel condition in
the typical NOMA LU pair to achieve high rate performance.
LetUsandUwdenote the strong LU and the weak LU in
the LU pair, respectively. The power allocation coefﬁcient for
Usisasand that for Uwisaw, whereas+aw= 1. For user
fairness, the higher power level is always allocated to Uw, i.e.,
aw> as.
We consider the BS transmits Gaussian signals for both
LUs. If the reﬂecting LU is the strong LU, i.e., UR=Us,UR
decodes the massage of UTﬁrst. For the operation protocol
XS∈ {TS,ES}, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio

For the case that the transmitting LU is the strong LU, the
expressions can be obtained similarly, and we skip it here.
Since the SIC order in NOMA depends on the order of channel
gains, we focus on the performance of the strong LU and the
weak LU in the rest of the paper. Thus the subscript ε∈ {s,w}
related to the type of LUs.
We consider the worst-case of the secure transmission, and
hence we focus on the most detrimental Eve which has the
highest detecting SNR of Uε. When the most detrimental
Eve is at the LU τ∈ {s,w}side of the STAR-RIS, the
instantaneous SNR of detecting the information of Uεat the
Eve can be presented as

III. S ECRECY OUTAGE PROBABILITY
In this section, we consider the scenario where the CSI
of Eves is unavailable at the BS. In this case, we employ
the SOP as the performance metric. We ﬁrst obtain new
channel statistics for STAR-RIS-aided links. Then we deriv e
the theoretical SOP expressions of the typical NOMA LU pair
in the considered networks. Finally, the asymptotic SOP in t he
high SNR regime is provided.
A. New Channel Statistics
The STAR-RIS assisted transmission introduces cascaded
small-scale fading. For the fading channel from the BS to the
LU/Eve through the STAR-RIS element n, we denote ∆n=5

Some widely known fading distributions including Rayleigh
distribution, Nakagami- mdistribution, and Rician distribution
are the special cases of the κ-µdistribution. In Table I, we
conclude the parameters and the simpliﬁed PDFs for those
typical fading models in the cascaded channel. Allowing κi=
Kiandµi= 1fori∈ {1,2}, we are able to obtain the double
Rician distribution with the shape parameter Kiand the scale
parameter 1. WhenKi→0, the distribution becomes the
double Rayleigh distribution. If we set κi→0andµi=mi,
the double Nakagami- mdistribution with the shape parameter
miand the spread parameter 1.
Lemma 1. When the number of STAR-RIS elements is large
enough, the overall small-scale fading power for the LUs
obeys a Gamma distribution

the Eves obeys
|he|2∼Gamma(1 ,We), (14)
whereWe=N(mr2+σr2).
Proof: Based on the results in our previous work [29], if
mrandσr2are the mean and the variance of ∆n, respectively,
the overall small-scale fading power |hu|2can be approxi-
mately ﬁtted by a Gamma distribution Gamma/parenleftBig

the Eves fulﬁlls |he|2∼N(mr2+σr2)×Gamma(1 ,1).According to the property of the cascaded κ-µdistribution,
this lemma is proved.
Lemma 2. In the NOMA LU pair, CDFs of the channel
power for the strong LU and the weak LU can be respectively
expressed as

Note that the most detrimental Eve is at either the strong

where(a)is obtained by applying [33, eq. (3.326.10)]. This
completes the proof.
When adopting the TS protocol, the channel capacity for the
pair of LUs is CTS
Uε=Tεlog2(1+γTS
ε), while the capacity for
the reﬂecting/transmitting Eve is CTS
Eε,τ=Tτlog2(1+γTS
Eε,τ).
To obtain neat expressions, we propose a mapping method
to unify the SNR at different sides of the STAR-RIS. We
introduce the equivalent received SNR for Eves as follows.
Deﬁnition 1. For the TS protocol, we deploy an equivalent Eve
Eτ→εof the most detrimental Eτ, which locates at the same
side of the STAR-RIS as the Uεand has the same capacity as
Eτ. The equivalent received SNR at Eτ→εis
ˆγTS
Eτ→ε=/parenleftbig
1+γTS
Eτ/parenrightbigTτ
Tε−1. (21)
Then the PDF of the equivalent received SNR of the most
detrimental Eve in all reﬂecting and transmitting Eves can b e
calculated.
Lemma 4. For the TS protocol, the PDF of the equivalent
received SNR for the most detrimental Eve in terms of the Uε
data is given by

the CDF of the equivalent received SNR for the Eve is

Utilizing γTS

From Theorem 1 , we can easily observe that with the
increase of Ts, the secrecy outage performance for the strong
LU is improved monotonically while the trend is the opposite
for the weak LU. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the
SOPs of the strong LU and the weak LU.
When considering the ES protocol, the channel capacity of
the legitimate LUs is expressed as CES
Uε= log2(1+γES
ε)and
that for the Eves is CES
Eε= log2(1+γES
Eε). Similarly, we utilize
the mapping method for the equivalent received SNR in this
case as follows.

Eve ofEτlocated at the same side as the Uε, and the
equivalent received SNR is

Proof: By applying the Gauss–Laguerre quadrature and
the Chebyshev–Gauss quadrature to the SOP expressions for
the strong LU and the weak LU, respectively, the corollary
can be proved.
Similar to the conclusion of the TS protocol, with a larger
βsthe better SOP for the strong LU is obtained while the
secrecy performance becomes worse for the weak LU in the
ES protocol.
Remark 1. When adjusting the STAR-RIS mode operation
parameters Tεorβε, there is a trade-off between the SOP
performance of the strong LU and the weak LU. In practice
implementation, we should decide the STAR-RIS mode opera-
tion parameters according to different LU requirements.
C. Diversity Order Analysis
To show further insights into the system implementation, we
investigate the SOP in the high-SNR regime. Eves are assumed
to have a powerful detection capability as the above analysi s.
The asymptotic performance is analyzed, especially when th e
difference of the channel SNR between the BS and LUs is
sufﬁciently high, i.e., ρb→ ∞ . Note that when Eve’s transmit
SNRρe→ ∞ , the probability of successful eavesdropping
tends to unity. We deﬁne the secrecy diversity order as
DXS=−lim
ρb→∞log2/parenleftbig
PXS
out,∞/parenrightbig
log2(ρb), (34)wherePXS
out,∞is the asymptotic SOP.
It can be observed from Theorem 1 andTheorem 2 that
the SOP is the integral of the product of fˆγXS
Eε(x)andFHε(x).
The expression is quite complex, so the relationship betwee n
ρband the SOP expression is not straightforward. We ﬁrst
derive the asymptotic CDF of the unordered channel power
gainˆFHu(x)which is related to FHε(x).
Lemma 6. Whenx→0+, the CDF of unordered LU channel
power gain is given by
ˆF0+
Hu(x) =LuxˆµN, (35)
whereLu=2AuNRUαˆµN
ALˆµN ,ˆµ= min{µ1,µ2}andAu=

2+ˆµ)Γ(ˆµ)√πeµ1κ1+µ2κ2.Ku= 2 whenµ1=µ2;
otherwise, Ku= 1.
Proof: See Appendix B.
Based on (A.5) in Appendix A, the asymptotic CDF
of ordered LU channel power gain is F0+

[LuxˆµN]k[1−LuxˆµN]K−k≈LulxˆµNlfor thel-
th weakest LU. If the signal is transmitted to LUs without
being eavesdropped, i.e., ρe→0, the outage probability can
be expressed as FHε/parenleftBig
1
ρbgXS
ε(0)/parenrightBig
. Therefore, the diversity
orders for the weak LU and the strong LU are ˆµNand2ˆµN,
respectively.
Remark 2. When considering the STAR-RIS-assisted trans-
mission in the no-eavesdropping scenario, the diversity or der
for the NOMA LUs has a linear correlation with the number of
elements on the STAR-RIS. Therefore, the outage performanc e
can be improved by increasing the number of elements in this
case.
When considering the PLS, however, we cannot ignore the
impact of fˆγXS
Eε(x)on the SOP performance. Since ˆγXS
Eεmay
have a long-tail PDF, it is unreasonable to calculate the sec recy
diversity order by utilizing the asymptotic CDF obtained in
Lemma 6 as in [22]. Therefore, we employ the method of
changing variables to calculate the secrecy diversity orde r of
the strong LU as follows.
Corollary 2. In STAR-RIS-NOMA, the secrecy diversity order
of the strong LU is expressed as
DXS
s=/braceleftBiggˆTδXS = TS
δXS = ES ,(36)
whereˆT= min
τ∈{s,w}ˆTτ,s.
Proof: Noticed that only FHs/parenleftBig

includes ρb
while the accurate expression of FHs/parenleftBig
1
ρbgXS
s(x)/parenrightBig
is quite
complicated, we calculate the SOP by changing the variable
t=x
ρb. For the TS protocol, the SOP for the strong LU is8
rewritten as
PTS
s=δmsρb/integraldisplay∞

Then we are able to obtain the secrecy diversity order by usin g
its deﬁnition. For the ES protocol, the derivation procedur e is
similar and hence we skip it here. The proof is completed.
Remark 3. SinceˆT≤1, the secrecy diversity order of the
strong LU in the TS protocol is no higher than that in the ES
protocol.
Different from the scenario without Eves, the secrecy di-
versity order for the strong LU is unrelated to the number of
STAR-RIS elements. Furthermore, by properly adjusting the
STAR-RIS mode operation parameter, the best secrecy diver-
sity order for both protocols is δ, which is only determined
by the path loss exponent.
For the weak LU, intra-cluster interference may degrade
the secrecy performance. As we have discussed in the proof
ofTheorem 1 , if
aw−/parenleftBig
2Rw
Tw(ˆγTS
Es+1)−1/parenrightBig
as≤0, (39)
holds, the SOP of the weak LU is one for the TS protocol. In
this case, the SOP has an error ﬂoor due to FˆγTS
Es(1
2Rw/Twas)<
1. A similar conclusion can be obtained for the ES protocol.
Remark 4. Considering the PLS in the NOMA scheme, the
error ﬂoor of the weak LU in terms of the SOP depends on
the CDF of the received SNR for the Eve, i.e., FˆγTS
Es(x). When
FˆγTS
Es(BXS
up) = 1 , the error ﬂoor can be avoided. This usually
happens when the SNR is high and the required threshold is
low.
Based on the characteristic of fˆγTS
Es(x), we are able to
calculate the error ﬂoor in the following corollary.
Corollary 3. The secrecy error ﬂoor of the weak LU is
expressed as
EFXS
w=¯FˆγXSw/parenleftbig
BXS
up/parenrightbig
. (40)
Therefore, the secrecy security order of the weak LU is zero.
Proof: Whenρb→ ∞ , the received SINR for the weak
LU tends to a constantaw
as. Let us take the TS protocol as an
example. Based on the deﬁnition of the SOP, in the high SNR,we have
PTS

(41)
then the corollary is proved.
Remark 5. In the considered secure STAR-RIS-NOMA trans-
mission, the SOP of the NOMA LU pair has the error ﬂoor
due to the error ﬂoor of the weak LU. Therefore, the secrecy
diversity order of the NOMA LU pair is zero.
IV. A VERAGE SECRECY CAPACITY
In this section, we consider the scenario where the CSI
of Eves is available at the BS. Here we employ the ASC as
the principal secrecy performance metric because the BS can
adapt transmission rate according to CSI of the LUs and the
Eves to achieve perfect secure transmission. The closed-fo rm
expressions are derived ﬁrst, and then the asymptotic ASC,
i.e., the secrecy slope, is investigated for further insigh ts.
A. Average Secrecy Capacity Analysis
The ASC is deﬁned as the expectation value of the non-
negative secrecy capacity over the fading channel and the
spatial effect [38]. In the considered networks, the ASC for
the protocol XS∈ {TS,ES}is expressed as
CXS
ε=E/bracketleftBig/bracketleftbig
CXS
Uε−CXS
Eε/bracketrightbig+/bracketrightBig
. (42)
We observe that the theoretical expression of ASC can be
obtained based on the derivation of the SOP. The analtyical
expressions of the ASC for the TS protocol and ES protocol
are given in Theorem 3 andTheorem 4 .

Proof: By utilizing similar proof of Theorem 3 , this
theorem can be proved.
Remark 6. For the TS protocol, the ASC is linearly related
to the STAR-RIS mode operation parameter Tε. For the ES
protocol, however, the ASC is non-linear with βs.9

Afterwards, the derived ASC can be further written as
closed-form expressions in the following corollaries.

secrecy slope in the high-SNR regime is considered, which is

proved.
Proposition 3. For the ES protocol, the asymptotic ASC in
the high-SNR regime can be expressed as (55) and (56).
Proof: The proof is similar to Proposition 2 .
Remark 7. In the considered networks, the secrecy slopes of
the TS protocol are STS
s=TsandSTS
w= 0 for the strong
LU and the weak LU, respectively. For the ES protocol, the
secrecy slopes are SES
s= 1 andSES
w= 0. Therefore, the ES
protocol achieves a higher ASC than the TS protocol at a high
SNR.
For clarity, we summarize all results of the secrecy diversi ty
and the secrecy slope for two STAR-RIS protocols in Table
II, where SU represents the strong LU and WU is the weak
LU.
V. N UMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we present the numerical results to demon-
strate the performance of STAR-RIS-NOMA. Our theoretical
results are validated and then some interesting insights ar e
provided. We mainly focus on the TS and the ES protocols
of the STAR-RIS. Unless otherwise stated, the simulation
parameters are deﬁned as follows. Consider line-of-sight ( LoS)
transmissions, the small-scale fading channel is modeled a s the
cascaded Rician channel [16], and hence we set κ1=κ2= 3
andµ1=µ2= 1. The density of Eves is λe= 10−4m−2.
The path loss exponent is α= 3. The outage threshold for
both LUs is Rs=Rw= 0.1bit per channel use. The number
of elements on the STAR-RIS is N= 25 . The radius of the
disc area is RU= 50 m. The transmit SNR ρb= 80 dB
andρe= 50 dB. The power allocation coefﬁcients for the10

we observe that the STAR-RIS-aided channel model with a
large number of elements has a higher channel power than the
model with a few elements. Therefore, the enhanced received
SNR at LUs can be obtained by deploying large-scale STAR-
RISs.
Fig. 3 plots the SOP performance of the paired NOMA
LUs versus the transmit SNR ρb. The theoretical curves ﬁt
the simulation results quite well and hence Theorem 1 and
Theorem 2 are validated. Moreover, the asymptotic SOP is
presented. As we have discussed in Corollary 2 andCorollary
3, the secrecy diversity order of the strong LU is a positive
constant related to the path loss exponent while the SOP of
the weak LU has an error ﬂoor at the high SNR. For the TS
protocol, when the time allocation coefﬁcient Ts<0.5, the
secrecy diversity order of the strong LU is linear with Ts. In
this case, the ES protocol has a larger secrecy diversity ord er
than the TS protocol for the strong LU.
Fig. 4 illustrates the impact of the number of STAR-RIS
elements Non the SOP performance. Although the Gamma
approximation is adopted to characterize the overall small -
scale fading power of STAR-RIS-aided links, it can be ob-
served that the analytical results match the simulation mar kseven when Nis small. Moreover, the SOP of the NOMA
LU pair is highly dependent on the worst performance in the
paired LUs at a high SNR. With the increase of N, the SOP
of the NOMA LU pair decreases ﬁrst but ﬁnally keeps at a
constant value. This is due to the error ﬂoor of the weak LU.
Therefore, the increase in the number of elements is able to
improve the SOP performance within a certain range, but a
large number of elements cannot reduce the error ﬂoor of the
secure STAR-RIS-NOMA transmission.
Fig. 5 plots the SOP of the NOMA LU pair versus the
STAR-RIS operation coefﬁcients Tsandβsin the TS protocol
and ES protocol, respectively. One can observe that the ES
protocol outperforms the TS protocol when Ts=βs. Another
observation is that there exists an optimal Tsorβsbetween 0
and 1 to realize the lowest SOP. When Ts=βs={0,1}, the
secrecy rate of one of the NOMA LUs is zero, and the SOP
for the LU pair is one in this case. When Ts=βs∈(0,1),
the SOP is smaller than 1 and hence a minimum value
exists. Thus a design guideline is provided that the SOP
performance can be improved by adjusting the STAR-RIS
operation coefﬁcients. Furthermore, the optimal Tsorβsis
reduced as RUincreases. Since the SOP of the LU pair mainly
depends on the worst performance in two LUs as shown in
Fig. 4, the optimal Tsorβsis approximated as the crosspoint
of the SOP curves of two LUs. With the increase of RU, the
gap of best SOP performance of two LUs is bridged and the
crosspoint moves to the larger Tsorβs.
Fig. 6 shows the ASC of two NOMA LUs versus the
transmit SNR ρb. The analytical results are from Theorem
3and Theorem 4 . The approximation results are obtained
inCorollary 4 and Corollary 5 . We can observe that the
approximation results of the weak LU ﬁt the simulation curve s
well while there is a small performance gap for the strong LU
especially at a high SNR. This is because the Chebyshev-
Gauss quadrature is accurate even with a small Mu. However,
the parameter Muis not large enough to ensure the accuracy
of the Gauss–Laguerre quadrature. In Fig. 6(a), the secrecy
slope for the strong LU in the TS protocol is smaller than
the ES protocol as discussed in Remark 7 . In Fig. 6(b), with12

the increase of the transmit SNR ρb, the ASC of the weak
LU achieves an upper bound. In the ES protocol, the capacity
upper bounds for two NOMA LUs are the same. Moreover,
the ES protocol has a higher ASC performance than the TS
protocol since extra ﬂexibility from the space is utilized b y
the ES protocol.
Fig. 7 plots the ASC of the NOMA LU pair versus the
number of STAR-RIS elements for two protocols. Different
from the observation in the SOP performance, the ASC keeps
growing linearly as the number of elements increases. The
reason is that the achievable rate of the strong LU can be im-
proved by strengthening the RIS-assisted channel. Therefo re,
a high ASC can be achieved by employing a STAR-RIS with
a large number of elements.
Fig. 8 compares the ASC performance among different
scenarios under different STAR-RIS mode operation paramet er
values. We observe that the ASC of NOMA obtains a signiﬁ-
cant improvement over OMA. This illustrates the efﬁciency o f
adopting the NOMA scheme in STAR-RIS-aided systems. To
show the efﬁciency of the phase aligned scheme at the paired
NOMA LUs, we plot curves of the Eve depression scheme and
the random phase setup for comparison. In the Eve depression
scheme, the STAR-RIS suppresses the eavesdropping of the
most detrimental Eve and reduces its capacity to zero as in
[17]. We can observe that the phase aligned scheme is able to
improve the secrecy rate performance remarkably, while the
enhancement of the Eve depression scheme is negligible in th e
considered multi-Eve system. Moreover, when we set Ts=βs,
the rate performance of the ES protocol always outperforms
the TS protocol due to the extra degree of freedom in the
space domain. By adjusting Tsorβs, the highest ASC can be
achieved. One should be noted that the ASC of the TS protocol
is linear with Ts(Remark 6 ), and hence Ts= 1 is optimal.
However, the optimal βsdepends on the system settings.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, the PLS of the STAR-RIS-NOMA has been
investigated. The stochastic geometry based tool has been
utilized to model the random locations of NOMA LUs andthe Eves. Considering the TS protocol and the ES protocol,
we have derived the analytical expressions of the SOP and
the ASC when the SIC order of the NOMA LUs is based on
the channel gains. In the high SNR regime, the asymptotic
secrecy performance has been obtained. The analytical resu lts
have revealed that the error ﬂoor exists for the SOP in the
secure STAR-RIS-NOMA transmission. The numerical results
have provided design guidelines for the considered system: 1)
the optimal secrecy performance can be achieved by adjustin g
the mode operation parameters of the STAR-RIS; 2) the
ES protocol has a better secrecy performance than the TS
protocol; 3) the STAR-RIS with a large number of elements
can be employed for the high ASC.

To obtain the accurate asymptotic performance, we consider
the accurate expression rather than the Gamma approximatio n
for the small-scale fading power |hu|2. Note that all channels
of the STAR-RIS are independent, we employ the convolution
method to derive the distribution of the overall small-scal e
fading power |hu|2. Based on (11), we ﬁrst calculate the
Laplace transform of f∆n(x)as in (B.1). We denote Jq,t=

We observe that (B.1) is so complicated that it is difﬁcult
to obtain the tractable expression of the inverse Laplace
transform for/producttextN
n=1Lf∆n(ω). Therefore, we consider the case
ω→ ∞ to calculate the PDF of the overall channel gain near
0. When ω→ ∞ ,H1→1holds. We only keep the dominant
item in (B.1), i.e., the item with r=t= 0, and we have
L∞
f∆n(ω) =Auω−2ˆµ, (B.3)
whereˆµ= min{µ1,µ2}andAuis a constant unrelated to
ω. Since all channels of the STAR-RIS are i.i.d., the Laplace
transform of the PDF for the overall small-scale fading gain
|hu|is
L∞
f|hu|(ω) =AuNω−2ˆµN. (B.4)
We are able to obtain the PDF of |hu|by conducting the
inverse Laplace transform of L∞

Then we obtain the CDF of |hu|as follows
