Abstract
In this paper, we study the viability and stability of anisot ropic
compact stars in the context of f(Q) theory, where Qis non-metricity
scalar. We useFinch-Skea solutions toinvestigate thephys ical proper-
ties of compact stars. To determine the values of unknown con stants,
we match internal spacetime with the exterior region at the b ound-
ary surface. Furthermore, we study the various physical qua ntities,
including eﬀective matter variables, energy conditions and equation
of state parameters inside the considered compact stars. Th e equilib-
rium and stability states of the proposed compact stars are e xamined
through the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ equation, causali ty condi-
tion, Herrera cracking approach and adiabatic index, respe ctively. It
is found that viable and stable compact stars exist in f(Q) theory as
all the necessary conditions are satisﬁed.

The study of cosmos and its components inspired many researcher s in
the last few years due to their mysterious nature. Stars are cons idered the
basic components of astronomy and the essential building blocks of galax-
ies. Fusion processes have signiﬁcant eﬀects on the development o f stars and
planets. The equilibrium position of stars is maintained through the fu sion
process if there is a balance between the inward force of gravity an d the out-
ward pressure. After the consumption of nuclear fuel, the star c ollapses and
as a result new compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars a nd black
holes are formed depending on their initial mass. Compact stars hav e a dif-
ferent nature than ordinary stars as they have large masses and small radii.
These cosmic objects have attracted the attention of many rese archers due
to their signiﬁcant features. Baade and Zwicky [1] investigated the geometry
of compact objects and proposed the concept of pulsars like Her X -1. After
discovering pulsars, the theory of neutron stars acquired obser vational vali-
dation [2]. Dev and Gleiser [3] analyzed the physical behavior of pulsar s with
diﬀerentconsiderations. MakandHarko[4]usedthemass-radiusr elationship
to analyze the stability of pulsars. Kalam et al [5] examined the viabilit y and
stability of compact stars using the Karori-Barua technique. The d ynamics
of compact objects near the boundary with massless and massive s calar ﬁeld
are explored in [6].
The anisotropy modiﬁes some signiﬁcant characteristics of relativis tic ob-
jects. According to Ruderman [7], nuclear matter demonstrates anisotropy
if the matter density of relativistic particles is equivalent to 1015gcm−3. Due
to phase transition and viscosity, the distribution of matter exhibit s pressure
anisotropy [8]. Bowers and Liang [9] examined the anisotropy of a re lativistic
sphere and the physical characteristics of anisotropic pressure . The eﬀects
of local anisotropy for self-gravitating systems have been examin ed in [10].
The equilibrium composition and static spherical anisotropic solution h ave
been studied in [11]. Karori-Barua solutions were used to analyze the be-
havior of anisotropic quark stars in [12]. Dourah and Ray [13] studied the
metric solutions for compact stars. Later, Finch and Skea [14] mo diﬁed the
metric solutions in four dimensions for anisotropic star models. The F inch-
Skea solutions were used to develop relativistic star models [15]. Bhar [16]
determined the physical characteristics of compact stars by usin g the equa-
tion of state (EoS) parameter and Finch-Skea solutions. Anisotro pic stellar
structures using Finch-Skea potentials have been examined in [17]. T hese
2solutions were also used to evaluate the anisotropic compact conﬁg urations
[18].
In modiﬁed theories of gravity, the study of stellar structures is a ma-
jor topic for discussion. Numerous studies on star structures ha ve been
analyzed in the last few decades. Accordingly, the Symmetric telepa rallel
gravity, which is also known as f(Q) is an intriguing theory that has gained
attention in recent years [19]-[21]. The study of f(Q) gravity is the most
debatable phenomenon of the current time. Lazkoz et al [22] esta blished a
credible set of limitations on f(Q) gravity, where the polynomial expression
of gravity is given as a function of redshift. Moreover, the f(Q) gravity
showed some fascinating results using observational measuremen ts [23]-[28].
Furthermore, the study of diﬀerent cosmic objects with diﬀerent matter con-
ﬁgurations in the framework of f(Q) gravity has been discussed in [29]-[32].
Olmo [33] studied the geometry of compact stellar objects using poly tropic
EoS in Palatini f(R) gravity. Arapoglu et al [34] used barotropic EoS to
examine the compactness of pulsars in the same theory. Zubair et a l [35]
investigated the viable behavior of rotating neutron stars in the ba ckground
off(R,T) theory. Mustafa and his collaborators [36] studied compact sphe r-
ical structures with diﬀerent considerations. Maurya et al [37] a nalyzed the
eﬀect of charge on the stability of spherical objects through the Karmarkar
condition in f(G,T) gravity. Sharif and Gul studied the Noether symmetry
approach [38], stability of the Einstein universe [41] and dynamics of grav-
itational collapse [40] in modiﬁed theory. In the framework of oﬀ-dia gonal
tetrad, the study of anisotropic strange stars in f(τ,T) gravity presented
in [41]. Das et al [42] considered Finch-Skea geometry to study the v iable
behavior of pulsars in the context of Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravit y. Dita et
al [43] studied the characteristics of celestial objects using a mod iﬁed Van
der Waals EoS in the presence of charge in f(Q) gravity. Recently, the study
of observational constraints in modiﬁed f(Q) gravity discussed in [44] and
thermal ﬂuctuations of compact objects as charged and unchar ged BHs in
f(Q) gravity are explored in [45]. Some people have also studied the char -
acteristics of celestial objects in diﬀerent scenarios of modiﬁed gr avity and
obtained interesting results [46].
In this article, we analyzed the viability and stability of compact ob-
jects by considering Finch Skea solutions in f(Q) theory. The manuscript
is arranged as follows. The basics of f(Q) gravity with anisotropic mat-
ter conﬁguration is presented in Section 2. The geometrical explanation of
metric and the evaluation of unknown constant is given in Section 3. Sec-
3tion4analyzes some physical features to determine the viability of compa ct
stars. Further, we check the stability analysis in Section 5. Our results are
summarized in section 6.

2 Finch-Skea Solutions and Matching Condi-
tions
Compact stars are fascinating objects that result from the grav itational col-
lapse of massive stars. Understanding their structure, composit ion and be-
havior is crucial for advancing our knowledge of fundamental phys ics and
astrophysics. Diﬀerent solutions, including Finch-Skea solutions ar e consid-
ered to describe the properties of compact stars and their variou s aspects,
such as density proﬁles, pressure, and temperature distribution s. Finch-Skea
solutionsprovideinsightsintothebehaviorofmatteratextremeco nditionsin
compact stars. These solutions predict distinct gravitational wav e signatures
that could be compared with observations to validate or reﬁne the m odels.
Finch-Skea solutions provide insights into the interior structure of compact
stars, helping astrophysicists to understand phenomena such as the forma-
tion of quark-gluon plasma or other exotic states of matter. The F inch-Skea
solutions are ﬁnite and non-singular, ensuring that the spacetime is smooth
and free from singularities.
The modeling of stellar objects using Finch-Skea solutions has attain ed
a lot of interest in recent years due to their non-singular behavior. These
solutions are deﬁned as [14]

3 Physical Attributes
In this section, we examine the physical characteristics of compac t stars
through graphs in the background of f(Q) gravity. We evaluate the behavior
of eﬀective matter variable, anisotropy, energy condition, mass, compactness,
redshift and EoS parameters in the interior of proposed compact s tars. Fur-
ther, we use the TOV equation, sound speed and adiabatic index to a nalyze
the equilibrium stability state of considered stars.
3.1 Energy Density and Pressure Components
Figure2shows that the behavior of energy density, radial pressure and t an-
gential pressure is positive and decreasing for all considered comp act star
candidates. It can also be seen that matter variables are maximum a t the
center of stars. Figure 3represents that the radial derivative of energy den-
sity, radial and tangential pressure components are negative, w hich ensures
the presence of a highly compact picture of the considered compac t stars in
the framework of f(Q) gravity.

3.3 Energy Bounds
Energy conditions are essential for understanding several cosm ological ﬁnd-
ings connected to signiﬁcant gravitational ﬁelds. Due to the vital r ole of
energy bounds, some interesting results have been published in [47]- [49]. For
anisotropic ﬂuid, NEC(null energy condition), WEC(weak energy condi-
tion),SEC(strong energy condition) and DEC( dominant energy condition)
can be classiﬁed as
•NEC:ρ+Pr≥0, ρ+Pt≥0,
•WEC:ρ≥, ρ+Pr≥0, ρ+Pt≥0,
•DEC:ρ−Pr≥0, ρ−Pt≥0,
•SEC:ρ+Pr≥0, ρ+Pt≥0,ρ+2Pt+Pr≥0.
Figure5shows that all energy conditions are satisﬁed for all star models.
3.4 EoS Parameters
Here, we investigate the crucial EoS parameters in describing the r elation-
ship between pressure and energy density in various physical syst ems. The
radial (φr=Pr

According to Buchdahl [50] compact stellar objects are feasible if t his factor
has the limit µ(r)<4

2−1)
is considered to be the key concept to understand the nature of c ompact
objects. Figure 8determines that the compactness and redshift lie in the
required limits ( µ <4
9,Z≤5.2).
144 Stability Analysis
Itismoreinteresting toexaminecelestial objects thatmaintainthe irstability

explore the equilibrium state of the star candidates and sound spee d as well
as adiabatic index to check the stability.

The TOV equation in the framework of f(Q) is formulated in Eq.(19). This

The causality condition in the case of anisotropic matter conﬁgurat ion is
deﬁned as

The range of radial sound speed and transverse sound speed mus t satisfy the
following inequality 0 ≤ |v2

that the desired conditions are fulﬁlled as shown in Figures 10and11. This
proves the stability of our compact star models in the framework of f(Q)
gravity.

The another alternative technique to investigate the stability of co mpact
stars is adiabatic index. The radial and transverse components of adiabatic

Figure 12: Behavior of adiabatic index versus r.
According to adiabatic index criteria, the system is stable if Γ >4
3otherwise,
it is unstable [54]. Figure 12shows that our system is stable in the presence
of modiﬁed terms corresponding to all considered compact stars.
5 Final Remarks
In this paper, we have examined the viability and stability of compact s tars
in the background of f(Q) theory. To evaluate the graphical characteristics
of compact stars, we formulate the functional form as f(Q) =k1Q+k2. The
main results are given by
•The graphical behavior of energy density versus radial coordinat e de-
pictsthatenergydensityapproachestothemaximumvaluewhen r→0
as shown in Figure 2. We have noted the same behavior for PtandPr
that is positive and decreasing. The radial derivative of the energy
density and pressure components are negative for considered co mpact
star candidates as shown in Figure 3.
•The anisotropy for the compact star candidates is directed outwa rd as
shown in Figure 4.
•Energy conditions for compact star candidates are positive, which en-
sure the presence of normal matter in the proposed compact sta rs as
shown in Figure 5.
•It is examined that the EoS parameters satisfy the required bound for
20radial component 0 < φr<1 and tangential component 0 < φt<1 as
given in Figure 6.
•There is a direct relation between the mass and radius of the compac t
stars, suggesting that the mass function remains regular at the c enter
of the compact stars (Figure 7).
•Compactness and redshift functions satisﬁed the required limits in t he
presence of modiﬁed terms as presented in Figure 8.
•It is found that the proposed compact stars are stable as all the n eces-
sary conditions are fulﬁlled as shown in Figures 9-12.
Itisnoteworthytomentionherethatwehaveobtainedmorestable anisotropic
stellar structures due to the presence of f(Q) terms as compared to GR and
other modiﬁed theories [55]-[57]. We can conclude that viable and stab le
compact stars exist in this modiﬁed theory.
