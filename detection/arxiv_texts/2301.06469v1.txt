1 INTRODUCTION
The texts that are part of French law are modiﬁed by amending text s published in the Oﬃcial
JournaloftheFrenchRepublic(JORF).Thelifecycleofalegis lativeorregulatorytextbeginswith
thepublicationofitscompleteversion intheJORFandcontinue swiththepossible publication of
texts amending it.The fullamended text, calledits consolidated version, isnever published in the
JORFandhasno legalvalue: only the initial version andthe suite o fthe ordered modiﬁcations of
the text are authentic [8].
Since 2008, the French Légifrance [4] website presents most of th e legal texts in their original
versionsaswellasintheirsuccessiveversions,consequenceso fthemodiﬁcationsbroughttothese
textsovertime.TheoperatoroftheLégifrancewebsite,theD irectionofLegalandAdministrative
Information(DILA),manuallyreportsthemodiﬁcationsdescri bedinnaturallanguageinthetexts
in order to obtain,at eachmodiﬁcation date, thecompletecons olidated version of thetext.
This convenience of access to the texts in an easier-to-read and e asier-to-use version has de
facto changed the status of these consolidated versions: they a re seen by most users, including
legalprofessionals, asthe reﬂectionof the applicablelaw [ 7].Moreover,the draftersof new texts,
in the French parliament or in the ministries, start fromthis co nsolidated version to conceive the
modifying texts. It is therefore of the utmost importance that this consolidation work be free of
errorsand available assoonaspossible.
WepresentherepreliminaryworkintegratedintheLegistixtoo lthatwearedeveloping,whose
objective is to create an automated and reliable consolidatio n system for French legal texts. This
work is based both on regular expressions used in several comp ound grammars, similar to the
successive passesofacompiler,andonanewspecializedlangua geoffunctionaltype,allowingto
describe the changesapplied tothe texts.
For each modiﬁer text, our tool generates fully automaticall y a computer program in this new
languagewhich,whenexecuted,performsthechangesinducedby themodiﬁertext onthetarget
texts.Inpreviousworkonthistopic,presentedforexamplei n[6],onlytheproblemofclassifying
types of modiﬁcation is addressed. To the best of our knowledg e, our work is the ﬁrst to present
acompleteapproachtoidentifytargettextsandtotransformth enaturallanguageinstructionsof
the modiﬁertext into a computerprogramformalizingthe actua ltransformation rules.
Unlike other topics of study related to legal texts, such as ex tracting automatically reasonings,
rulesoflawortryingtounderstandthesemanticsofthetext,wep laceourselvesinapurely legis-
tic[8]perspective, i.e. we do not try to understand the meaning of the text, but only its structure
and its relations to othertexts. Since our problemis clearlyde ﬁned, it lendsitself well to automa-
tion, since the consolidation must be careful not to interpret the changes but only to apply them
to the letter [7].

The amending text that modiﬁes the target code article contains i nstructions for humans to
modify the original text and to obtain the new text. These instruc tions are insertions, deletions,
replacements, etc. We can also note in the 4° bis paragraph of th e article a mistake made by the
legislator of a previous amending law voted in the Parliament: " Who were not were... ". The objec-
tive of our tool is to transform these instructions intended for hu mans into a computer program
allowing to applythemautomatically.
1These changes, applied manually by the DILA, can be viewed online on t he Légifrance website:
https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/section_lc/LEGITEX T000005634379/LEGISCTA000006161381/2022-10-26/#LEGI SCTA000006161381

3 DATA,IDENTIFIERS AND VERSIONS
ThedataintegratedintoLegistixaremadeupofthewholeofthe JORF[1]andLEGI[2]databases
provided and updated daily by the DILA. These databases contai n all the texts published in the
JORF since 1990 as well as all the texts that have been consolida ted by the DILA. The data are
integrated into the Legistix database on an ongoing basis, thanks to an integration process that
improves the data, reconstructing in particular the paragrap hs and the versions of the tables of
contentsnotprovidedintheoriginaldata.Forexample,theComm ercialCodehasover600versions
since 2000.
Each document receives a unique identiﬁer in the form of a URI. Th e form of this URI is a
continuation of the work carried out with the DILA in the context of the Légimobile [9] project.
These identiﬁers have the particularity of being perennial and of being able to be systematically
derived from the information in the document itself. Thus, for example, article 1 of the law 2022-
1348ofOctober24,2022presentedinﬁg.1hastheuniqueURIfr/ loi/2022-1348/1,representingall
the versions ofthis article over time.
To specify a particular version, the identiﬁers also support t he many dates governing the life
cycle of a law: date of signature, date of publication in the JO RF, dates of modiﬁcation leading to
versions, date of of abrogation. Thus, the version published i n the JORF on October 25, 2022 of
the previous article has as the URI fr/loi/2022-1348/1/202 21025. Following the same logic, article
L723-4of the Commercial Code in its version in force since Oct ober 13, 2021presented ﬁg. 2 has
the URIfr/code/commerce/L723-4/20211013.
4 DETECTION OF MODIFIED TEXTSAND CREATION OF NEW VERSIONS
In the example of law 2022-1348, Legistix detects the refere nce "L723-4 of the Commercial Code "
present twice. Thanks to the identiﬁer mechanism described abov e, it will be resolved into the
identiﬁerfr/code/commerce/L723-4,withouttheneedtoquer yanexternalresolutionmechanism:
the characterstring of the referenceis enough.

# s is fr/loi/2022-1348/1/20221025
Legistixmustnowﬁndthediﬀerentversionsofthetargettexttha twillbeusedinthedescribed
changes. The ﬁrst version we need is the one from which we start, i .e. the version on which the
changes are to be applied. For the ﬁrst reference found in paragr aph I, the date is the date of
publication in the JORFofthe source text, i.e. October25,2 022.Thereference:
t = db.get_version(/quotedbl.Varfr/code/commerce/L723-4/quotedbl.Var, Date(202 2, 10, 25))
# t is fr/code/commerce/L723-4/20211013 (!)
# that is, the version in force on October 25, 2022
is positioned in article L723-4 in its version as of October 13 , 2021. Indeed, the version in force
of this text on October 25, 2022 is that of October 13, 2021 [12 ], as modiﬁed by Article 1 of Law
2021-1317whichcameinto forceon the sameday [11].

# v2 is fr/code/commerce/L723-4/20230101, created from ve rsion v1
The names s,t,v1andv2represent abstract references to documents. As we will see in th e
nextsection,thesereferencescanbeusedtoabstractlyrefere nceportionsoftext.Forexample,the
methods parandsenwill allow to generate functions which will respectively retur n references
to a paragraph or a sentence when they are evaluated. Thus, s.par(/quotedbl.VarI/quotedbl.Var) generates a function
which,whenevaluated, will return a referenceto paragraphI ofarticle 1oflaw 2022-1348.These
generatorscanbecombinedasin:
v1.par(/quotedbl.VarII/quotedbl.Var).par(/quotedbl.Var2°/quotedbl.Var).sen(1)
which generates a function allowing to obtain the ﬁrst sentence of the 2° of the II of the article
L723-4ofthe commercialcodein its version ofoctober26,20 22.

6 CONCLUSIONAND PERSPECTIVES
We started with a reference database of several decadeswhere the consolidation wasalready car-
ried out manually.Thishistorical consolidation serves asa r eference to measure the reliability of
ourapproach.TheLegistix toolisableto automate93%ofthe consolidation operationsthatwere
previously performed manually. Our eﬀorts will continue in ord er to reach a rate of 100%,by an-
alyzingtheundetectedcases,someofwhichare ambiguouseven forahuman,thuscontradicting
the mechanizableaspect desired by the legislator [7].
The next step will be to extend our work to the EUR-Lex [3] databa se containing the law of
the European Union and where regulations and directives are publ ished on a publication model
similar to French law.
Third, we will propose an expert system [5] to assist legisla tors for the drafting of modifying
