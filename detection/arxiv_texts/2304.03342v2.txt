The aim of this paper is to investigate the use of Pyragas control on the stability of stationary, localised coherent
structures in a general class of two-component, singularly perturbed, reaction-diffusion systems. We use noninvasive
Pyragas-like proportional feedback control to stabilise a singular pulse solution to a two-component, singularly per-
turbed reaction-diffusion system. We show that in a significant region of parameter space, the control can be adjusted
to stabilise an otherwise unstable pulse.
Singularly perturbed pulses in two-component reaction-
diffusion equations are generally unstable in large regions
of parameter space. To address this instability, we utilize
Pyragas control, which was originally developed for peri-
odic solutions of ordinary differential equations, to create
a noninvasive feedback control for singularly perturbed
pulses in reaction-diffusion systems. We prove the effect-
iveness of this control technique by analyzing the spectral
stability of the controlled singular pulse in a toy model,
using Evans function techniques.
I. INTRODUCTION
Reaction-diffusion systems are mathematical models based
on semi-linear parabolic partial differential equations1. One
of the most fascinating aspects of reaction-diffusion equations
is the plethora of patterns that can emerge from their solu-
tions. These patterns include such diverse phenomena spiral
waves in a chemical oscillator2, the different animal coat
patterns3, Faraday waves4, or various patterns in Rayleigh–
Bénard convection5, geology6, or fluid dynamics7.
These patterns, of which some can be classified as Turing
patterns8, exhibit a variety of behaviors, including the forma-
tion of travelling waves and wave-like phenomena, as well as
self-organized structures such as stripes, hexagons, and dis-
sipative solitons9. The study of these patterns has significant
implications for understanding natural phenomena and has led
to new insights in various fields10.
The focus of this article is on the analysis and control
of a specific spatially localized coherent structure in a two-
component reaction-diffusion equation: a symmetric singular
pulse11–13. An illustration of this pulse is presented in Figure
1. It is characterized by a noticeable scale separation, which
is evident in the difference in pulse width between the two
components.
a)Also at Freie Universität Berlin, Institut für Mathematik, Arnimallee 7,
14195 Berlin, GermanyIt has been shown12,13that such two-component pulses can
only be stable when the nonlinear interaction between the two
components is sufficiently strong. Even when this is the case,
singular pulses are unstable for large regions in parameter
space, see Ref 12, Lemmas 5.11, 5.12, and 5.14. As such,
singular pulses are infrequently observed in nature or experi-
ments. Often only the progression toward a stable steady state
is observable, while unstable steady states remain largely im-
perceptible.
It is therefore our goal to introduce a Pyragas-like control
term to make unstable pulses visible. Pyragas control14,15is
advantageous as it is noninvasive on the pulses, i.e., the con-
trol term vanishes and does not change the pulse itself. How-
ever, it changes the nearby solutions and thereby the stabil-
ity properties of the pulse. Another benefit of this control
approach is its model-independence and low implementation
cost, as it does not require expensive calculations. Although
originally designed for periodic solutions of ordinary differen-
tial equations, we adapt it for controlling singularly perturbed
pulses in reaction-diffusion systems.
We aim to integrate control theory with the theory of pat-
tern existence and stability in singularly perturbed reaction-
diffusion systems. Specifically, we aim to control the stability
of pulse solutions and develop a novel methodology to regu-
late the stability of diverse patterns in a broad class of singu-
larly perturbed reaction-diffusion systems.
This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we discuss
our model system and introduce the singular pulse as the pat-
tern of interest; we also introduce noninvasive control terms.
Next, in Section III, we construct an Evans function to de-
termine the spectral stability of the singular pulse. Our main
result is presented in Section IV, where we demonstrate that
noninvasive feedback stabilization can be achieved in a large
region of parameter space. We provide a brief summary of the
stability proof in this section, with a complete and detailed
version of the proof available in the appendix (section A). We
conclude with a short discussion in Section V.arXiv:2304.03342v2  [math.DS]  4 Aug 20232
II. MODEL, PATTERNS AND CONTROL
A. Model
We consider the following general class of two-component,
singularly perturbed, reaction-diffusion equations:
ut=uxx−µu+F1(u)+1
εF2(u,v), (1a)
vt=ε2vxx−v+G(u,v), (1b)
with x∈R,µ>0 and 0 <ε≪1 asymptotically small.
The nonlinear functions F1,2and Gobey mild regularity
assumptions12; most importantly, F2andGconverge super-
linearly to 0 as V→0.
All subsequent calculations will be carried out in the context
of the following toy model:
ut=uxx−u+1
εf(u)2To(u)v2
3, (2a)
vt=ε2vxx−v+f(u)v2, (2b)
with fandT0smooth functions of u.
System (2) exhibits most defining qualities of the general
model class (1), while allowing for explicit computations. We
emphasise, however, that the methods and techniques used in
this paper apply to all systems of the general class (1).
B. Patterns
The spatially localised coherent structure to be studied in
this paper is a symmetric singular pulse, bi-asymptotic to the
trivial background state; see Figure 1. The singularly per-
turbed nature of (1), through the asymptotically small diffu-
sion term ε2vxx, induces a spatial scale separation in station-
ary pattern solutions to (1). For singular pulses, this scale
separation is visible in the difference in pulse width between
theu- and v-component, see again Figure 1; to this end, we
introduce the short-scale spatial variable
ξ=x
ε. (3)
The presence of the asymptotically small parameter εallows
for the application of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory
(GSPT) to rigorously establish the existence –by a construct-
ive proof– of stationary, symmetric singular pulse solutions12.
Hence, we state the existence of a stationary, symmetric
pulse solution (up(x),vp(ξ))to (1), with (up(x),vp(ξ))∼
e−|x|,e−|ξ|
asx→ ±∞, provided an algebraic condition in
terms of F1,2andGis satisfied12. For the toy model (2), this
algebraic condition is
µu2=To(u)2. (4)

where u∗>0 is a nondegenerate solution to (4), for which we
assume that f(u∗)̸=0. For more details on the pulse construc-
tion and proof of existence, see Ref 12.
C. Control
The aim of this paper is to investigate the use of Pyragas
control14–16on the stability of stationary, localised coherent
structures in (1). To that end, we introduce feedback control
terms KandLto (1), yielding
ut=uxx−µu+F1(u)+1
εF2(u,v)+K[u,v], (6a)
vt=ε2vxx−v+G(u,v)+L[u,v], (6b)
where K[up(x),vp(ξ)] =0=L[up(x),vp(ξ)]. As the feedback
control terms vanish on the target pattern (up,vp), this type of
control is called non-invasive . For control of patterns in PDEs,
a wide range of possible control terms can be applied, includ-
ing spatio-temporal delay, proportional feedback, or combin-
ations of these17–20In this paper, we investigate one specific
form of non-invasive control, applied to the toy model (2).
We leave the u-equation intact, and add proportional feedback
control to the v-equation, yielding
ut=uxx−u+1
εf(u)2To(u)v2
3, (7a)
vt=ε2vxx−v+f(u)v2+ℓ(v−vp(x)), (7b)
withℓ:R→Rcontinuously differentiable at zero, and ℓ(0) =
0. Note that the latter condition ensures that (up,vp)(5) is a
solution to (7). We have opted for control solely on the vari-
able vsince it exhibits a high degree of spatial localization,
with the v-component of the pulse essentially being zero bey-
ond the spike region. This offers advantages from an applic-
ation standpoint, as implementing localized controls is often
simpler compared to extended controls covering a larger area.
Note that, consequently, on the linear level, the control is
not a multiple of the identity matrix. Therefore, the influence
of the control term ℓis not as straightforward as shifting all3
eigenvalues to the left. Our goal is to derive conditions on the
control function ℓsuch that the singular pulse (up,vp)(5) is a
stable solution to (7).
III. PULSE STABILITY AND THE EVANS FUNCTION
In order to be observable, a stationary pulse solution needs
to be stable as a solution to the PDE system (1). The (spec-
tral) stability of a singular pulse solution to (1) can be determ-
ined through constructing an Evans function E(λ), an ana-
lytic function whose roots precisely coincide with the (dis-
crete) spectrum of the linear operator obtained by linearising
(1) at the singular pulse (up,vp)21,22. That is, we consider the
eigenvalue problem

where all (partial) derivatives of F1,2andGare evaluated at
(u,v) = ( up(x),vp(ξ)).
The essential spectrum of L(9) is real, negative, and bounded
away from the imaginary axis12; hence, the pulse stability is
determined by its discrete spectrum, i.e. the roots of the as-
sociated Evans function E(λ). In Ref 12, it is shown that the
singularly perturbed structure of the pulse can be used to ob-
tain an explicit characterisation of the roots of E(λ)to leading
order in ε; moreover, these roots perturb regularly in ε.
For sake of brevity, we omit further details, and only state the
main outcome of the theory developed in Ref 12 when applied
to the toy model (2): the spectrum of the pulse (5) is to leading
order in εdetermined by the roots of the function

A typical configuration of the spectrum of L(9) is shown
in Figure 2. The pulse can lose stability when a pair of ei-
genvalues crosses the imaginary axis (a Hopf bifurcation) or
when a real eigenvalue passes through the origin. Note that
the pulse spectrum consists of both discrete (point) spectrum
and essential (continuous) spectrum, as the spatial domain is
unbounded.t

IV. PULSE STABILISATION THROUGH PROPORTIONAL
FEEDBACK CONTROL
The main research question that we address in this paper
is: Given a singular pulse solution (up,vp)to (1), can we find
control terms K,Lsuch that this singular pulse is a stable solu-
tion to (6)?
As the introduction of control terms has a (potentially) signi-
ficant influence on the stability analysis of the singular pulse,
we try to answer the research question formulated above in
the context of the toy problem (2), with proportional feedback
control in the v-equation (7). We first present the main out-
come of our analysis in Theorem 1, and describe the main
ideas of the proof. The full proof of Theorem 1 can be found
in Appendix A.
Theorem 1. Let0<ε≪1be sufficiently small, and assume
that u ∗is a nondegenerate solution to (4). Consider the sym-
metric singular pulse solution (up,vp)to(2), which is to lead-
ing order in εgiven by (5), and introduce ρ:=2f′(u∗)
f(u∗)+T′o(u∗)
To(u∗).
1. If f′(u∗) =0, then the singular pulse (up,vp)is always
unstable for any choice of proportional control function
ℓ(v−vp)as implemented in (7).
2. If f′(u∗)<0, then it is possible to choose a proportional
control function ℓ(v−vp), as implemented in (7), such
that the singular pulse (up,vp)is stable.
3. Let f′(u∗)>0.
(a) If ρ>1
u∗, then the singular pulse (up,vp)is al-
ways unstable for any choice of proportional con-
trol function ℓ(v−vp)as implemented in (7).
(b) If ρ<1
u∗, then it is possible to choose a pro-
portional control function ℓ(v−vp), as implemen-
ted in (7), such that the pulse solution (up,vp)is
stable.
A visual representation of the statement of Theorem 1 is
given in Figure 3. A direct application of Theorem 1 for4
specific parameter values is shown in Figures 4 and 5.
It is worthwhile to note that control on one variable only
suffices to control both components of the pulse.
Specific conditions that the control function ℓneeds to sat-
isfy to stabilise the pulse can be found in the proof of Lemma
4, Appendix A. In particular, the essential spectrum is stable
if and only if ℓ′(0)<1 (A4).
Moreover, note that the controllability of the pulse strongly
depends on the quantity ρ=2(f′/f) + ( T′
0/T0), which cor-
responds to the logarithmic derivative of f2(u)T0(u). This
quantity represents the u-dependent nonlinearity of (2)(a) at
u=u∗.
Remark 2.While the purpose of this paper is to show the
stabilisation of pulse that is unstable in the absence of con-
trol, it is worthwhile to note that our control scheme can also
destabilise an otherwise stable pulse. For example, choosing
ℓ′(0)<1 destabilises the pulse through a sideband instability,
as the essential spectrum is pushed through the imaginary axis
(A4). We do not explore such destabilisation scenarios in the
current paper; the desirability of pulse destabilisation through
noninvasive control depends on the model context and applic-
ation.
The proof of Theorem 1 starts with the observation that the
linear stability of (up,vp)as a solution to (7) can be written as

struct an Evans function, as presented in Ref 12, can be ap-
plied to (12). The singularly perturbed structure of the pulse
again leads to the result that the solutions to the eigenvalue
problem (12) are, to leading order in ε, determined by the
roots of the function

The remainder of the proof is a detailed analysis of the mero-

derstanding the λ-dependence of the integral term in (13),
which is closely related the λ-dependence of ˆ vin(λ−ℓ′(0)),
where ˆ vinis the unique bounded solution to (11).
Next, we introduce ˆλ=λ−ℓ′(0), and use Weyl–Titchmarsh–

(numerically determined), the pulse is stable without control;
stability is lost either through a Hopf bifurcation (red curve)

the red region and on the dashed lines, the pulse is unstable
and cannot be controlled, see Theorem 1 1) and 3a). In the
remainder of the parameter space, the pulse is unstable but
can be stabilised by proportional control in the v-component,
as implemented in (7)
V. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the possibility of
stabilizing singularly perturbed pulses in two-component
reaction-diffusion equations across significant areas of the
parameter plane. Specifically, for the toy model (2), we have
identified three regions in the (ρ,f′(u∗))-plane: a stable re-
gion where control is unnecessary, an unstable region where
control is always insufficient, and – our main interest here –
a large region where pulse stability can be controlled through
our proposed control term.
Several potential avenues for future investigation emerge.
First, it may be worthwhile to explore the use of a “true”
Pyragas control, in which the control is not proportional but
includes a delay term, and as such does not rely on expli-
cit pre-existing knowledge of the pulse structure. This poses
additional problems in the rigorous stability analysis as diffi-
culties may arise concerning nonlinear stability. For the con-
trol scheme investigated in this paper, it was not necessary to
differentiate between spectral and nonlinear stability. In the
non-controlled eigenvalue problem (8), spectral stability im-
plies nonlinear stability; this follows from a classical result by
Henry1because the operator L(9) is sectorial. The linear op-
erator associated to the ’controlled’ eigenvalue problem (12)
has the same (sectorial) property. Hence, one can directly in-
fer nonlinear stability from spectral stability. For other control
strategies, such as delayed feedback, the sectorial property is5

generally not retained. In such case, one needs to be more
careful about deducing nonlinear stability; see e.g. Ref 25 for
generalisations of Henry’s result.
Second, investigating the impact of control on the large
scale component uin comparison to the current focus on the
small scale component vwould provide valuable insights for
this two-component system. Additionally, exploring the po-
tential of non-diagonal controls would also be of interest.

control will stabilise the pulse through a Hopf bifurcation.
Third, our current analysis has focused on relatively simple
spatially-localized coherent structures. It would be interesting
to investigate the potential extension of our control scheme to
more complex patterns, such as multi-circuit configurations13
and/or periodic pulse patterns26, and to determine the condi-
tions under which stabilization can be achieved for these more
intricate situations.

a. Pulse stability and the Evans function
For the stability analysis of the pulse (up,vp), we follow the
approach of Ref 12. The eigenvalue problem determining the6
linear stability of (up,vp)is given by

(A2b)
We can write (A2) as a first order system for φ= (u,uξ,v,vξ),
φξ=A(ξ;λ,ε)φ. (A3)
This formulation allows us to use the theory presented in Ref
21. First, we observe that the matrix Ais asymptotically
constant since (up(ξ),vp(ξ))→(0,0)asξ→ ±∞. The as-
sociated asymptotic matrix A∞(λ,ε):=limξ→±∞A(ξ;λ,ε)
has eigenvaluesn

is hyperbolic if and only if λ>−1+min(ℓ′(0),0). Since

∂ξ−A∞, the essential spectrum of ∂ξ−Ais given by
σess=
λ∈R:λ≤ −1+max(ℓ′(0),0)	
. (A4)
We observe that the essential spectrum is stable if and only if
ℓ′(0)<1. Hence, from this point onward, we assume
ℓ′(0)<1, (A5)
as a necessary condition for the spectrum of ∂ξ−Ato be
stable. The remainder of the spectrum is discrete; note that
elements of this point spectrum can (and generically will)
have nonzero imaginary part.
The Evans function E(λ;ε)can now be defined for all
λ/∈σess, as follows. Let N(λ,ε)⊂R4be the set of initial
conditions such that the associated solutions to (A3) decay
exponentially as ξ→∞; analogously, let R(λ,ε)⊂R4be the
set of initial conditions such that the associated solutions to
(A3) decay exponentially as ξ→ −∞. Because A∞is hyper-
bolic for λ/∈σess, system (A3) has an exponential dichotomy,
and the subsets NandRare subspaces of R4of dimension 2.
Choosing an ordered basis {φ1,N,φ2,N}ofNand an ordered
basis{φ1,R,φ2,R}ofR, we define the Evans function as
E(λ;ε) =det(φ1,N,φ2,N,φ1,R,φ2,R). (A6)
The Evans function is analytic on its domain. Most import-
antly,E(λ)is zero if and only if λis an eigenvalue of (A3);
moreover, the algebraic multiplicity of this eigenvalue is equal
to the order of λas a zero of E(Ref 21, Theorem 4.1).b. An explicit expression for the Evans function
We can use the theory developed in Ref 12 to determine
an explicit expression for the Evans function E. In particular,
we observe that the approach and resulting expressions from
Ref 12, section 4 can be applied directly for the shifted eigen-
value ˆλ=λ−ℓ′(0). Note that, although the eigenvalue sys-
tem (A2) is superficially analogous to the equivalent system
(Ref 12, (3.2)) with parameter µ=1+ℓ′(0), the underlying
pulse solution itself depends on µas well through the exist-
ence condition (Ref 12, (2.16)). Therefore, we cannot a priori
apply the instability results from Ref 12, section 5. Moreover,
as the stability of the controlled pulse is determined by the real
part of λ, the stability condition for the shifted eigenvalue
ˆλ:=λ−ℓ′(0) (A7)
is given by
Reˆλ<−ℓ′(0). (A8)
In terms of ˆλ, the essential spectrum is given by
ˆσess=n
ˆλ∈R:ˆλ≤ −1+max(0,−ℓ′(0))o
. (A9)
From the analysis in Ref 12, it follows that for all ˆλ/∈ˆσess,
the Evans function Ecan be written as
E(ˆλ,ε) =4εtf(ˆλ,ε)ts(ˆλ,ε)q
1+ˆλq
1+ℓ′(0)+ˆλ,
(A10)
in terms of the so-called transmission functions tf(ˆλ,ε)and
ts(ˆλ,ε). These transmission functions are not necessarily
analytic, but merely meromorphic on C\ˆσess. The structure
of these transmission functions can be determined in more
detail, as explained in Ref 12. For future reference, we
summarise the most important aspects of the analysis in Ref
12 below.

the ‘fast’ transmission function tf(ˆλ,ε)are to leading order
inεgiven by the discrete spectrum of Lf; in addition, these
zeroes are simple. Moreover, the ‘slow’ transmission function
ts(ˆλ,ε)has a pole of order 1 exactly where tf(ˆλ,ε)has a zero,
except for the zero associated to ˆλ1=0 – that is, tshas a pole
for every discrete eigenvalue associated to an even eigenfunc-
tion. Hence, the relevant information about the zeroes of E
(A10), i.e. the point spectrum of ∂ξ−A(inˆλ), is entirely
decoded in ts. Note that, although the concept of zero-pole7
cancellation plays a central role in controllability and the ana-
lysis of transfer functions, the occurrence of this phenomenon
in the decomposition of the Evans function is completely un-
related to the method of Pyragas control that we employ in this
paper; it is solely related to the slow-fast structure of system
(A2) and the underlying pulse solution (up,vp).

Note that if f′(u∗) =0, then vin(A14) is trivial; hence no zero-
pole cancellation in the Evans function (A10) takes place, and
therefore λ0>0 is a zero of E, rendering the pulse unstable
and not controllable. Hence, assuming the nondegenerate situ-
ation f′(u∗)̸=0, we rewrite (A17) as

a priori take any value except zero, and αcan take any valueinR, depending on the properties of the model functions f

follows:
Given α,β∈R,β̸=0fixed, can we choose the control
parameter ℓ′(0)<1such, that the (complex) ˆλ-solutions to
(A18) outside the essential spectrum ˆσess(A9) all lie to the
left of the line Re ˆλ=−ℓ′(0)?
c. Spectral decomposition in the presence of essential
spectrum
Although (A16) can in principle be solved by variation of
parameters / Green’s function methods, the result in terms of
integrals over special functions does not easily yield the re-
quired insight into the functional behaviour of the right hand
side of (A18). Therefore, we use Weyl–Titchmarsh–Kodaira
spectral theory to express the integral
Z∞
−∞ˆvp(ξ)ˆvin(ξ;ˆλ)dξ=

in terms of projections onto eigenfunctions of the operator Lf
(A11). We follow the treatment of Ref 23, §2.18, §4.19. We
refer to Ref 24 for a modern and highly accessible overview
of Weyl–Titchmarsh–Kodaira spectral theory.
First, we define θ(ξ;ˆλ)andφ(ξ;ˆλ)such that {θ,φ}spans
the kernel of Lf−ˆλ, and θ(0) =1,∂ξθ(0) =0,φ(0) =0
and∂ξφ(0) =−1. Since Lfis symmetric under the reflection
ξ→ −ξ,θis even and φis odd as a function of ξ. Both θ
andφcan be expressed as a linear combination of associated

We can use this information to investigate the solutions to
(A18). To this end, we formulate the following Lemma,
which summarises relevant properties of the inner productD
ˆvin(·,ˆλ),ˆvpE
2(A29).
Lemma 3. Let R(ˆλ) =D
ˆvin(·,ˆλ),ˆvpE
2be as in (A29) . Then
the following statements hold:
(I) sgn Im R (ˆλ) =−sgn Im ˆλ;
(II) There exists c >0such that, if Re ˆλ>c, then Re R (ˆλ)>
0;
(III) For real ˆλ>ˆλ0, R(ˆλ)is positive and strictly monoton-
ically decreasing;
(IV) There exist d 1,2>0such that, if −d1<Reˆλ<d2, then
Re R(ˆλ)<0.

d. Results on proportional feedback control
Using the results obtained in the previous sections, we
can formulate the following Lemma on solutions to equation
(A18):
Lemma 4. Consider equation (A18) forˆλ∈Cwithα,β∈
Randℓ′(0)<1, where ˆvinis the unique bounded solution
to(A16) , and ˆvp(ξ) =3
2sech2ξ
2, cf. (5). Then the following
statements hold:
1. Ifβ>0, then all solutions ˆλto(A18) lie on the real
axis.
2. If β>0andα≤0, then there always exists a real,
positive solution ˆλ>ˆλ0to(A18) for any ℓ′(0)∈R.3. If−α≥β>0, then for any ℓ′(0)∈R, there exists a
real, positive solution ˆλ>−ℓ′(0)to(A18) .
4. If 0≤ −α<β, then there exists a value ℓ′(0)<−ˆλ0
such that all solutions ˆλto(A18) obey Re ˆλ<−ℓ(0).
5. Ifβ>0andα>0, then there exists a value ℓ′(0)<
−(1+ˆλ0)such that (A18) has no solutions.
6. Ifβ<0, then there exists ˆΛ<0such that, when ℓ′(0)<
ˆΛ, all solutions ˆλto(A18) lie to the left of the vertical
linen
Reˆλ=co
, with c >0independent of α,βand
ℓ′(0).
Proof. We define
L(ˆλ):=α+βq
1+ˆλ+ℓ′(0),
so (A18) can be written as L(ˆλ) =R(ˆλ).
1. Ifβ >0, then all solutions to (A18) lie on the real axis .
For the principal complex square root√z, which is defined for
allzaway from the negative real line, it holds that Re√z>0
and sgn Im√z=sgn Im z. It follows that, if β>0, Im L(ˆλ)
can only equal Im R(ˆλ)if both are zero, by Lemma 3 (I).
2. If β>0andα≤0, then there always exists a real,
positive solution ˆλ>ˆλ0for any ℓ′(0)∈R. By statement 1,
we take ˆλ∈R. Both RdandRcare positive for sufficiently
large ˆλby Lemma 3 (II); moreover, R(ˆλ)→0 as ˆλ→∞.
It follows that L(ˆλ)>R(ˆλ)for sufficiently large ˆλ, since
β>0. Moreover, from the observation that R(ˆλ)→+∞as
ˆλ↓ˆλ0=5
4, combined with the fact that L(ˆλ)is continuous
forˆλ≥ −1−ℓ′(0)andL(ˆλ)→α≤0 as ˆλ↓ −1−ℓ′(0), it
follows by continuity of R(ˆλ)forˆλ>ˆλ0=5
4that there exists
a real, positive solution to (A18), that lies to the right of the
point ˆλ=ˆλ0and to the right of the point ˆλ=−1−ℓ′(0).
3. If−α≥β >0, then for any ℓ′(0)∈R, there exists
a real, positive solution ˆλ >−ℓ′(0)to(A18) .Since R(ˆλ)
is positive for real ˆλ>ˆλ0by Lemma 3 (III), the intersec-
tion of the graphs R(ˆλ)andL(ˆλ)lies above the horizontal
ˆλ-axis. Since β>0 and α<0, the graph of L(ˆλ)is strictly
monotonically increasing on its domain and intersects the ho-
rizontal axis before intersecting the graph of R(ˆλ), as ˆλin-
creases. Denote the ˆλ-value for which the two graphs in-
tersect as ˆλ∗. From the monotonicity of the graphs, it fol-
lows that ˆλ∗is the largest solution to (A18). Moreover, as
L(ˆλ)if and only if ˆλ=
α
β2
−1−ℓ′(0), we conclude that
ˆλ∗>
α
β2
−1−ℓ′(0)>−ℓ′(0)since−α≥β.
4. If0≤ −α < β , then there exists a value ℓ′(0)<−ˆλ0
such that all solutions ˆλto(A18) obey Re ˆλ <−ℓ(0).We
calculate L(−1−ℓ′(0)) =α≤0 and L(−ℓ′(0)) =α+β>0.
Hence, the largest solution ˆλ∗to (A18) is contained in the in-
terval (−1−ℓ′(0),−ℓ′(0))if and only if R(−ℓ′(0))<α+β
by the monotonicity and continuity of L(ˆλ)andR(ˆλ). From10
Lemma 3 (III), it follows that R(−ℓ′(0))<α+βfor suffi-
ciently large |ℓ′(0)|.
5. Ifβ >0andα >0, then there exists a value ℓ′(0)<
−(1 +ˆλ0)such that (A18) has no solutions. By Lemma
3 (III), there exists ˆk>ˆλ0such that R(ˆλ)<αfor all ˆλ>ˆk.
Choosing ℓ′(0) =−1−ˆk, so that L(ˆk) =L(−1−ℓ′(0)) =α,
we see that (A18) cannot have any real solutions, which im-
plies that (A18) does not have any (complex) solutions by
statement 1.
6. If β <0, then there exists ˆΛ<0such that, when
ℓ′(0)<ˆΛ, all solutions to (A18) lie to the left of the ver-
tical linen
Reˆλ=co
, withc >0independent of α,β and
ℓ′(0).
Suppose α≤0, and consider ˆλ∈R. We can choose ℓ′(0)<
−(1+ˆλ0), making sure that the domain of L(ˆλ)lies entirely
to the right of ˆλ=ˆλ0. On this domain, we have L(ˆλ)<0,
while R(ˆλ)>0, from which we conclude that no real solu-
tions to (A18) exist. The same reasoning can be extended to
complex solutions of (A18), under the same assumption that
α≤0: because Re√z>0 for all zaway from the negative real
line, we have that Re L(ˆλ)<0 for all ˆλon its domain, while
there exists a c>0 such that Re R(ˆλ)>0 for all ˆλto the right
of the linen
Reˆλ=co
by Lemma 3 (II).
Now suppose α>0. For ˆλ∈R, the same reasoning as in the
caseα≤0 can be applied, choosing ℓ′(0)<
−α

−1−ˆλ0.
The reasoning for complex ˆλis also analogous to the case

3 (II).
e. Finishing the proof of Theorem 1
The results in Lemma 4 can now be used prove Theorem 1,
restated here for convenience:
Theorem. Let0<ε≪1be sufficiently small, and assume
that u ∗is a nondegenerate solution to (4). Consider the sym-
metric singular pulse solution (up,vp)to(2), which is to lead-
ing order in εgiven by (5), and introduce ν:=2f′(u∗)
f(u∗)+T′o(u∗)
To(u∗).
1. If f′(u∗) =0, then the singular pulse (up,vp)is always
unstable for any choice of proportional control function
ℓ(v−vp)as implemented in (7).
2. If f′(u∗)<0, then it is possible to choose a proportional
control function ℓ(v−vp), as implemented in (7), such
that the singular pulse (up,vp)is stable.
3. Let f′(u∗)>0.
(a) If ρ>1
u∗, then the singular pulse (up,vp)is al-
ways unstable for any choice of proportional con-
trol function ℓ(v−vp)as implemented in (7).(b) If ρ<1
u∗, then it is possible to choose a pro-
portional control function ℓ(v−vp), as implemen-
ted in (7), such that the pulse solution (up,vp)is
stable.
Proof. The pulse solution (up,vp)is spectrally stable if and
only if, for the shifted eigenvalue ˆλ=λ−ℓ′(0)(A7), the con-
dition Re ˆλ<−ℓ′(0)(A8) is satisfied. Eigenvalues ˆλcorres-
pond to zeroes of the Evans function E(ˆλ,ε)(A10). These
zeroes are, to leading order in ε, given by the solutions to
(A17).
Claim 1 follows from the observation that the only solution
vinto (A14) is the trivial solution when f′(u∗) =0. Hence,
the slow transmission function ts(A15) does nothave a pole
atˆλ=ˆλ0; therefore, no zero-pole cancellation in the Evans
function (A10) –as detailed in Ref 12– takes place. It follows
that the positive real zero near ˆλ0of the fast transmission func-
tiontfis also a zero of the full Evans function E, which means
the pulse solution (up,vp)is unstable.
Iff′(u∗)̸=0, then (A17) is of the form (A18), with α=
−6−3T′o(u∗)
To(u∗)f(u∗)
f′(u∗)andβ=3f(u∗)
f′(u∗)1
u∗.
When β<0, it follows from Lemma 4 (6) that there is a
c>0 such that all solutions of (A18) lie to the left of the
linen
Reˆλ=co
. Since c>0 is in particular independent of
ℓ′(0), and the statement holds for all ℓ′(0)<ˆΛ<0, we can
choose ℓ′(0)<−c, which implies that all solutions of (A18)
obey the stability criterion Re ˆλ<−ℓ′(0). Since β<0 if and
only if f′(u∗)<0, this proves claim 2 .
When α>0 and β>0, it follows from Lemma 4 (5) that
(A18) does not have any solutions when ℓ′(0)is negative
and|ℓ′(0)|is sufficiently large. As f′(u∗)̸=0, the zeroes of
tf(ˆλ,ε)near ˆλ0andˆλ2are cancelled by the poles of ts(ˆλ,ε);
the remaining zero ˆλ1=0 is stable for ℓ′(0)<0. It fol-
lows that all zeroes the Evans function E(ˆλ,ε)(A10) obey
Reˆλ<−ℓ′(0), which implies that (up,vp)is spectrally stable.
The condition α>0 is equivalent toT′o(u∗)
To(u∗)f(u∗)
f′(u∗)>−2, while
β>0 is equivalent tof(u∗)
f′(u∗)1
u∗>0. Since both u∗>0 and
f(u∗)>0)by assumption, the latter condition is equivalent to
f′(u∗)>0. This allows us to rewrite the α>0-condition as
T′o(u∗)
To(u∗)<−2f′(u∗)
f(u∗), thereby proving the second part of claim 3
for 2f′(u∗)
f(u∗)+T′o(u∗)
To(u∗)<0.
When 0 ≤ −α<β, it follows from Lemma 4 (4) that all
solutions to (A18) obey the stability criterion Re ˆλ<−ℓ′(0).
As before, the condition β>0 is equivalent to f′(u∗), while
the condition β>−α≥0 can be rewritten as 0 ≤2f′(u∗)
f(u∗)+
T′o(u∗)
To(u∗)<1
u∗, which finalises the proof of claim 3 b) .
When −α>β>0, it follows from Lemma 4 (3) that there
always exists a solution to (A18) that does not satisfy the sta-
bility criterion Re ˆλ<−ℓ′(0), regardless of the value of ℓ′(0).
This implies that, under the condition −α>β>0, the pulse
(up,vp)is unstable for any choice of the control function ℓ.
The condition β>0 is equivalent to f′(u∗)>0, while the11
condition −α>βcan be rewritten asf′(u∗)
f(u∗)+T′o(u∗)
To(u∗)>1
u∗,
which proves claim 3 a) .
