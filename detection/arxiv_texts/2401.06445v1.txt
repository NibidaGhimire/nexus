Abstract
Analyzing and characterizing the differences between networks is a fundamental
and challenging problem in network science. Previously, most network compar-
ison methods that rely on topological properties have been restricted to mea-
suring differences between two undirected networks. However, many networks,
such as biological networks, social networks, and transportation networks, ex-
hibit inherent directionality and higher-order attributes that should not be ig-
nored when comparing networks. Therefore, we propose a motif-based directed
network comparison method that captures the local, global, and higher-order
differences between two directed networks. Specifically, we first construct a mo-
tif distribution vector for each node, which captures the information of a node’s
involvement in different directed motifs. Then, the dissimilarity between two
directed networks is defined on the basis of a matrix which is composed of the
motif distribution vector of every node and Jensen-Shannon divergence. The
performance of our method is evaluated via the comparison of six real directed
networks with their null models as well as their perturbed networks based on
edge perturbation. Our method is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines and
is robust with different parameter settings.

Many systems in various domains, featuring intricate interaction relation-
ships, can be effectively represented in the form of complex networks [1], includ-
ing social platforms [2, 3], biological systems [4], economic systems [5]. Due to
the diversity of network forms [6, 7] and the high-order features of networks [8, 9],
the precise measurement of similarity between different networks, namely the
design of an effective network comparison method, has emerged as a central
focus in the field of network science. Network comparison aims to quantify the
differences between two networks based on network topological structure, allow-
ing the effective handling of different types of tasks [10, 11]. For example, in
the field of pattern recognition, network comparison can be applied to classify
content such as images, documents, and videos [12]. In the biological domain,
network comparison can be used to analyze which protein interactions may
have equivalent functions [13]. In neuroscience, the comparison of brain net-
works contributes to understanding the functional differences between normal
and pathological brains [14].
The original term used to compare networks was the graph isomorphism
problem [15], which has been proven to fall within the NP complexity class [16].
In recent years, researchers have proposed various methodologies from different
perspectives and technologies to measure the similarity between networks [17–
22]. The majority of these methods have primarily concentrated on the compar-
ison of undirected networks. However, interactions among distinct entities in
the real world commonly exhibit asymmetry. In social networks, an instance of
useritrusting user jdoes not necessarily imply reciprocal trust from jtoi. The
directionality of the interactions between nodes in a network, which cannot be
captured by an undirected network, has boosted the research of directed network
comparison. For example, Bagrow and Bollt [23] utilized portrait divergence, a
metric based on the distribution of the shortest path lengths, to evaluate the
structural similarities between networks. Koutra et al. [24] proposed Delta-
Con by calculating the Matusita distance of similarity matrices between two
2networks. Sarajlic et al. [25] extended network distance measures to directed
networks using directed graphlets, demonstrating their efficacy in distinguishing
various directed networks. The centrality-based methods, such as degree [26],
closeness [27], and clustering coefficient [28], compare networks based on the
centrality values of each node. Although these methods are capable of compar-
ing networks effectively to some extent, most of them have not considered the
higher-order structure of a network, which has been shown to be ubiquitous in
various complex systems [9]. Consequently, we propose using direct motifs to
quantify the dissimilarity between two networks. Motifs refer to recurring sub-
graphs in a network, where these subgraphs exhibit specific interaction patterns
that facilitate understanding of the functionality of networks [29]. Motifs have
been widely used in different network tasks, i.e., community detection[30], link
prediction[31], and node ranking problems[32].In contrast to traditional con-
ventional methods, motif-based approaches consistently exhibit superior perfor-
mance in tackling these problems.
To explore the similarity between different directed network structures, in
this paper we propose a motif-based directed network comparison method Dm,
i.e., using motifs to examine smaller components of directed networks to assess
the similarity between networks. We start by constructing a node motif distri-
bution matrix, where the elements in the matrix are obtained by computing the
distribution of nodes appearing in different directed motifs. Due to computa-
tional complexity, we consider the motifs composed of 2 to 4 nodes and thus
obtain 35 different directed motifs. Later on, we use the Jensen-Shannon diver-
gence to quantify the dissimilarity between two directed networks both locally
and globally. We validate the effectiveness of Dmin six real directed networks.
Compared to the baseline methods, Dmexhibits notable distinguishability and
robustness in comparing networks.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the defini-
tion of motifs in a directed network and details the motif-based directed network
comparison method. We provide a clear description of the baseline methods and
directed network datasets in Section 3. All experiment results are presented in
3Section 4. Section 5 summarizes the full paper.
2. Method
2.1. The definition of motifs in a directed network
A directed unweighted network is represented as G= (V, E), where V=
{v1, v2,···, vN}andE={ek= (vi, vj)|k= 1,···, M|vi, vj∈V}are the node
and edge set, respectively. The number of nodes and the number of edges are
given by NandM. The adjacent relationship between two nodes in Gis given
by the adjacency matrix A, with Aij= 1 indicating that there is a directed
edge between viandvj, and Aij= 0 implying that there are no edges between
them. We note that the directionality of Gdetermines that Ais an asymmetric
matrix.
Motifs are the most common graphical patterns in complex networks, con-
sisting of a group of closely connected nodes and edges. Due to the high com-
plexity of computing motifs in a network, we normally consider motifs formed
by 2 to 4 nodes. Motifs play a crucial role in the study of complex networks,
acting as fundamental building blocks for large complex networks, analogous to
genes in biology. In a directed network, the motifs are formed by nodes with
directed edges. We show examples of directed motifs in Figure 1. There are 35
directed motifs, each comprising 2 to 4 nodes, individually represented as m1
tom35, respectively. For instance, there are two kinds of motifs if we consider
two nodes, which are given by m1andm2in the figure.
2.2. Motif-Based Directed Network Comparison Method
Motifs contain important topological information of a network and thus are
essential for network comparison. Based on the distinctive topological prop-
erties of directed motifs, we first compute the motif distribution in a directed
network. As the time complexity of computing motifs is quite high, we will use
the motifs listed in Figure 1 that are formed by 2 ,3, and 4 nodes for the com-
putation of motif distribution. Specifically, we use Ti={ti(j)|1≤j≤35}to

5represent the motif distribution of node vi, where ti(j) represents the fraction of
motif jthat contains vi. Consequently, a N×35 matrix T={T1, T2,···, TN}
can be constructed based on the motif distribution of every node. We further
define directed network node dispersion ( DNND ) to measure connectivity het-
erogeneity between nodes. A larger DNND indicates greater heterogeneity in
the connectivity of nodes within the network, while a smaller DNND suggests
a more uniform distribution of node connections. And DNND is given by the
following equation:
DNND (G) =ζ(T1, T2,···, TN)
ln (N+ 1), (1)
where ζ(T1, T2,···, TN) is the Jensen-Shannon divergence of the Nmotif dis-
tributions, and is given by:
ζ(T1, T2,···, TN) =1
NX
i,jti(j) ln (ti(j)
µj), (2)
where µjrepresents the average value of Nmotif distributions, the specific
calculation is as follows:
µj=PN
i=1ti(j)
N(3)
Given two directed networks G1(V1, E1) and G2(V2, E2), the structural dis-
similarity between them can be calculated based on their motif distribution
matrices T1andT2. We use Dm(G1, G2) to represent the dissimilarity between
G1andG2, thus,
Dm(G1, G2) =φs
ζ(µG1, µG2)
ln 2+(1−φ)p
DNND (G1)−p
DNND (G2)(4)
The dissimilarity Dmcomprises two terms, and we use a parameter φ(0≤
φ≤1) to adjust their weights. The first term illustrates the difference be-
tween the average motif distributions, that is, µG1= (µG1
1, µG1
2,···, µG1
N1) and
µG2(µG2
1, µG2
2,···, µG2
N2), and predominantly signifies the global distinctions be-
6tween the two networks. The second term mainly describes the difference be-
tween the DNND s of the two networks, indicating the local difference between
them. A lower value of Dmindicates a higher network similarity and vice versa.
3. Baselines and Datasets
3.1. Baselines
Portrait-based directed network comparison method [23]: For a
directed network G, we construct a portrait matrix Bbased on the distance
between nodes. Each element Bl,krepresents the number of nodes that have
knodes at distance l, where 0 ≤l≤d, 0≤k≤N−1, and drepresents
the diameter of G. We note that we utilize the shortest directed path length
to calculate the distance between nodes. In addition, Bis independent of the
ordering and labeling of the nodes. Based on Bl,k, we can derive the probability
that a randomly selected node has knodes at a distance of land is given by
Ql,k=1
NBl,k (5)
For two directed networks, G1andG2, the probability distributions Q1and
Q2are employed to interpret the rows of the network portraits for each of them.
The similarity between G1andG2is represented as Dp(G1, G2) and is defined
as:
Dp(G1, G2) =1
2KL(Q1||M) +1
2KL(Q2||M), (6)
where M=1
2(Q1+Q2),KL(∗||∗) represents the Kullback-Liebler divergence
between two distributions.
DeltaCon-based directed network comparison method [24]: Delta-
Con considers the similarity between two networks by quantifying the differ-
ence of the r-step paths other than the edges. Given a directed and unweighted
network Gand its adjacency matrix A, the r-step paths are encoded in the
similarity matrix S=
I+ε2D−εA−1, where DandIare diagonal ma-
trices with diagonal elements equal to node degree and 1, respectively, and
7ε= 1/(1 + max( Dii))(i= 1,···, N). We assume that the similarity matrices
for two directed and unweighted networks G1andG2are denoted as SandS′,
and the dissimilarity Ddbetween them is given by the following equation:
Dd(G1, G2) =

NX
i,j=1p
Sij−q

Closeness-based directed network comparison method: Centrality
measures, such as degree, betweenness, and closeness, were used to compare
networks [27]. However, in the part of experiments, we find that closeness
centrality surpasses other centrality methods in network comparison. Therefore,
we omit the other centrality measures and only use closeness for directed network
comparison. Closeness centrality measures the importance of a node within a
network by evaluating the proximity of its connections to other nodes. The
closeness centrality of a node is defined as
ci=1P
i̸=jdij, (8)
where dijrepresents the directed shortest path length from node vito node vj.
For two directed networks G1andG2, we assume that the closeness centrality
vectors for them are given by c= (c1, c2,···, cN)Tandc′=
c′
1, c′
2,···, c′
NT
.
Therefore, the dissimilarity between G1andG2based on closeness centrality is
given as follows:
Dc(G1, G2) =NX
i=1|ci−c′

3.2. Description of Directed Network Datasets
To evaluate the performance of our proposed methods and the state-of-the-
art baselines, we select six real-world directed networks from diverse domains in-
cluding biological networks, transportation networks, and social networks. The
descriptions of each of the datasets are as follows:
Mac[33] describes the interactions between adult female Japanese macaques,
and is about the dominance behavior between them. Each node denotes a
8macaque and a directed edge from node vitovjindicates the dominance of vi
overvj.
Caenorhabditis elegans (Elegans)[34] is a neural network of Caenorhab-
ditis elegans. It uses directed edges to represent neural connections among neu-
rons in the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.
Physicians[35] is a directed network that describes the spread of innovation
among physicians. A directed edge ( vi, vj) between two physicians viandvj
implies that viwould turn to vjif he needs suggestions or is interested in a
discussion.
Email-Eu-core (Email)[36] is an email network that captures email inter-
actions between institution members in a large European research institution.
A directed edge between two staff viandvjmeans that staff vihas sent an
email to staff vj.
US airport[37] illustrates the flight connections between US airports. A
directed edge ( vi, vj) between two airports viandvjillustrates that there is at
least a flight from airport vitovj.
Chess[37] is a network that characterizes the interaction between players
in an international chess game within a month. A directed edge is formed from
a white player to a black player in this network.
Table 1 shows the basic properties of the directed networks mentioned above,
including the number of nodes ( N), the number of edges ( M), average degree
(Ad), average shortest path length ( Avl), and network diameter ( d).

94. Experimental Results
4.1. The dissimilarity between a real network and its null models
The null model is widely used as a tool for the comparison of network
topology[38], which retains specific network properties, such as degree distri-
bution or clustering coefficient via random reshuffling of network connections.
In this section, we propose three null models for directed networks to gradually
change the network topology and use our comparison method to compare each
directed network and its null models.
We extend the dk-series null models that were originally proposed for undi-
rected networks to directed networks[39], which retain the degree distributions,
correlations, and clustering of a real directed network to some extent. Con-
cretely, the models are illustrated as follows: Dk1.0 preserves the outdegree
and indegree of a node by randomly rewiring each directed edge. Therefore, the
degree sequence of the original network is preserved in the reshuffling process.
Dk2.0 reshuffles every edge in the network while maintaining the outdegree,
indegree, and joint degree distribution of the original network. Dk2.5 rewires
every edge by preserving the distribution of the degree-dependent clustering
coefficient. We note that the newly formed directed edges should never have
existed in the original network before.
We show examples of how to generate the null models in Figure 2(a-c), the
blue dashed lines indicate the newly connected edges. The left panel shows
the original network, and the right panel shows the network after the rewiring
process in each of the figures. Figure 2(a) shows an instance for Dk1.0. Specif-
ically, we disconnect the edges ( v1, v2) and ( v3, v4), and form new edges, i.e.,
(v1,v4) and ( v3,v2). Therefore, the in-degree and out-degree of each node is
preserved in this process. Figure 2(b) demonstrates the generation of a random
network via Dk2.0, which is more strict than Dk1.0. For example, if we dis-
connect the directed edge between v1andv2, that is, ( v1, v2), we need to find
a node that has the same indegree and outdegree as v2, and the appropriate
node is v4. Accordingly, we connect v1andv4and form a new directed edge
10(v1, v4). Therefore, Dk2.0 maintains the degree sequence and the joint degree
distribution of a network. In Figure 2(c), the degree (sum of indegree and out-
degree) and clustering coefficient for each node are {2,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1}and
{1/2,1/6,0,0,1/6,0,0,0,0}, respectively. Therefore, the average clustering co-
efficients for nodes that have degree of {1,2,3}are{0,1/2,1/12}, respectively,
which are also called degree-dependent clustering coefficients. We disconnect
the directed edges ( v1, v2) and ( v4, v3) and form new directed edges as ( v1, v3)
and ( v4, v2). In the rewired network, the degree-dependent clustering coefficient
distribution is the same as the original network.

the original network and the right panel shows the rewired network.
A lower value of kimplies greater disruption of the original network struc-
ture. In Figure 3, we use the motif-based directed network comparison method
to quantify the dissimilarity between each of the directed networks and its three
null models. Experimental results across six networks suggest that as kin-
creases, the similarity between the original network and its null models gradually
increases. The dissimilarity observed in our approach aligns with the generation
11of null models, providing further confirmation of the effectiveness and stability
of our model for comparing directed networks from different domains.

directed network comparison method. The null models are Dk1.0,Dk2.0 and Dk2.5. Smaller
values in the heatmap indicate a higher similarity, and vice versa.
4.2. The comparison of directed network and its perturbed network
In this section, we perform perturbation experiments on the edges of six
real directed networks to further assess the stability and applicability of the
motif-based comparison method. Specifically, for each given network, we ran-
domly add or remove edges with a certain proportion f, where the range of fis
[−0.9,0.9]. The positive value of findicates that we randomly add |f|fraction
of directed edges into the network, and the negative value of fmeans that we
randomly remove |f|fraction of the directed edges. We compare the original
network with the perturbed network by adding or removing edges using differ-
ent network comparison methods, as shown in Figure 4. The four comparison
methods ( Dm,Dp,Dd, and Dc) show similar trends; that is, the increase in
|f|will make the perturbed network have a greater difference from the original
network, which is consistent with intuition. This conclusion is especially sig-
12nificant when fis negative. However, the motif-based comparison method is
much better than the rest of the baselines for positive values of f. The curves
of the other three baselines for f > 0 are flatter than those of our method.
Taking the Mac network as an example (Figure 4(a)), the values of Dprange
from 0 .07 to 0 .13 for f∈[0,1], and the values of Dpare the same for f= 0.1
andf= 0.2, which is unreasonable. DdandDcalso show insignificant dissimi-
larities between networks in Figure 4(a)-(f). The baseline methods, such as Dp
andDc, are based on the distance between nodes, and Ddconsiders the r-step
paths of a network for network comparison. However, they have not considered
the higher-order network structure of a network and thus may result in poor
performance in network comparison.

Physicians; (d) Email; (e) US airport; (f) Chess. The parameter φofDmis set to 0 .5. Each
point in the figure is averaged over 100 realizations.
4.3. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
The motif-based directed network comparison method involves a parame-
ter, denoted as φ, that determines how much importance is given to the global
or local differences between two networks, with larger value of φindicting we
13consider more of global difference and vice versa. Therefore, we perform param-
eter analysis for φin the six real-world directed networks via the comparison of
original network and its perturbed networks. The results are given in Figure 5,
in which we use curves with different colors indicating we choose different val-
ues of φ(φ∈ {0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9}). The figure displays curves that exhibit a
similar trend for different values of φ, and there is small deviation among the
curves when f <0. However, the network dissimilarity for different fis more
significant for φ= 0.5 in most networks (except Physicians and Email), which
means we need to consider the global or local differences between networks for
comparison. Therefore, we use φ= 0.5 in the above analysis.

curves show we choose different values of φ, which is the only parameter in our method,

versa. We show results for networks: (a) Mac; (b) Elegans; (c) Physicians; (d) Email; (e) US
airport; (f) Chess. All results are averaged over 100 realizations.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce a comparison method Dmthat utilizes network
motifs to assess similarities in directed networks. The method, which consid-
ers both local and global differences between two directed networks as well
14as higher-order information, is based on node motif distributions and employs
Jensen-Shannon divergence. In detail, we use the motifs of sizes up to 4 that
are listed in Figure 1 to compute the motif distribution of nodes in a directed
network. Based on Jensen-Shannon divergence and motif distributions of nodes,
we define the dispersion of directed network nodes ( DNND ) to quantify the
heterogeneity of connectivity between nodes. Lastly, for two given directed net-
works, the similarity between them is further defined by the combination of
theDNND metrics and the average motif distributions. Our method aims to
better understand the internal connection patterns of the network nodes by cap-
turing essential subgraph structures. To show the effectiveness of our method,
we compare a directed network with its null models, which gradually change the
structure of the original network. In addition, we further compare our method
with the baselines to characterize the similarity between an orignal network and
its perturbed networks The results show that our method outperforms these
baseline methods across networks from different domains.
Motifs have been widely used to address a range of tasks. In our analysis,
we take into account the directionality of edges by utilizing directed motifs to
compare directed networks. We limit our analysis to motifs of sizes up to 4
due to the high computational expenses involved. Although considering larger
motifs could potentially enhance the effectiveness of our approach, it may pose
scalability challenges when dealing with large networks containing millions of
nodes. Given the success of motifs in network comparison, we believe that
developing efficient algorithms for computing motifs could be a promising avenue
for research. This not only has the potential to enhance network comparison,
but also to improve other network tasks such as community detection, node
classification, influence maximization, and more.
