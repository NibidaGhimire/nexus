ABSTRACT
We explore evolution in the dust-to-gas ratio with density within four well-resolved Local Group
galaxies { the LMC, SMC, M 31, and M 33. We do this using new Herschel maps, which restore
extended emission that was missed by previous Herschel reductions. This improved data allows us to
probe the dust-to-gas ratio across 2.5 orders of magnitude in ISM surface density. We nd signicant
evolution in the dust-to-gas ratio, with dust-to-gas varying with density within each galaxy by up to
a factor 22.4. We explore several possible reasons for this, and our favored explanation is dust grain
growth in denser regions of ISM. We nd that the evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio with ISM surface
density is very similar between M 31 and M 33, despite their large dierences in mass, metallicity,
and star formation rate; conversely, we nd M 33 and the LMC to have very dierent dust-to-gas
evolution proles, despite their close similarity in those properties. Our dust-to-gas ratios address
previous disagreement between UV- and FIR-based dust-to-gas estimates for the Magellanic Clouds,
removing the disagreement for the LMC, and considerably reducing it for the SMC { with our new
dust-to-gas measurements being factors of 2.4 and 2.0 greater than the previous far-infrared estimates,
respectively. We also observe that the dust-to-gas ratio appears to fall at the highest densities for the
LMC, M 31, and M 33; this is unlikely to be an actual physical phenomenon, and we posit that it may
be due to a combined eect of dark gas, and changing dust mass opacity.

1.INTRODUCTION
The relationship between dust and gas in the Inter-
Stellar Medium (ISM) is complex. There are various
mechanisms by which dust is added to the ISM, and
others which remove dust from it.
For instance, newly-created dust grains can be added
to the ISM via the deaths of stars { either by core-
collapse supernov (Barlow et al. 2010; Matsuura et al.
2011; Gomez et al. 2012), or by asymptotic giant branch
stars (H ofner & Olofsson 2018). The dust mass of
the ISM can also increase in situ, through dust grains
accreting gas-phase metals in higher-density environ-
ments (K ohler et al. 2015; Zhukovska et al. 2016; Jones

cclark@stsci.eduet al. 2017). Similarly, dust can be removed from the
ISM in a number of dierent ways. Dust can undergo
photo-destruction by high-energy photons, especially in
poorly-shielded low-density environments; or dust can
be sputtered by forward & reverse supernov shocks
(Jones 2004; Bocchio et al. 2014; Slavin et al. 2015a;
making the status of supernov as net sources or sinks
of dust uncertain).
The key metric for assessing the dust-richness of the
ISM is the dust-to-gas ratio (D/G). The various pro-
cesses that add or remove dust from the ISM will change
D/G, as will other processes, such as the preferential
removal of the dust-richest ISM via the formation of
new stars and planets (Hjorth et al. 2014; Forgan et al.
2017), and the dilution of the ISM by the infall of low-
metallicity extragalactic gas (Edmunds & Eales 1998) {
both of which will drive down D/G.arXiv:2302.07378v1  [astro-ph.GA]  14 Feb 20232 Clark et al.

The Herschel images are foreground-subtracted maps; see Section 2. The LMC, the best-resolved galaxy of the sample, is shown
at the top. The lower row shows the SMC ( left), M 31 ( center ), and M 33 ( right). Each channel of each image uses a logarithmic
color scale that displays the map's structure over the its full value range. Simple visual inspection of the changing colors within
these images make clear that there is signicant evolution in the dust and gas properties in each of our sample galaxies.The Quest for the Missing Dust: II 3
Clearly, the balance between dust creation and de-
struction in galaxies, and therefore D/G, is sensitive to
many factors. And unavoidably, the relative importance
of these factors will vary greatly between dierent en-
vironments; both between, and within, galaxies. The
balance between dust creation and destruction is es-
pecially important in light of the `dust budget crisis',
arising from the fact that observed sources of dust ap-
pear insucient to account for observed dust masses in
some galaxies (Matsuura et al. 2009), particularly at
high redshift (Rowlands et al. 2014), unless signicant
grain-growth occurs in the ISM (De Vis et al. 2017a;
Galliano et al. 2021).
Strong evidence for grain growth comes from the fact
that the D/G ratio is observed to increase in higher
density environments, even when controlling for metal-
licity. This has been seen in spectroscopic absorption
measurements of the depletion of various metals from
the gas phase (Jenkins 2009; Tchernyshyov et al. 2015;
Roman-Duval et al. 2021), in measurements of extinc-
tion curve evolution (Gordon et al. 2003; Fitzpatrick &
Massa 2005), and in resolved Far-InfraRed (FIR) ob-
servations of the dust emission within nearby galaxies
(Mattsson et al. 2014; Roman-Duval et al. 2014, 2017).
It should be noted that work by Nanni et al. (2020)
nds that grain growth is not necessarily required to ex-
plain the chemical evolution of low-metallicity and high-
zgalaxies, if the initial mass function is top-heavy, and if
outow rates are high. Similarly, work by De Looze et al.
(2020) indicates that low-redshift dust masses could be
explained primarily by dust from stellar sources, without
the need for ecient interstellar grain-growth, if dust
lifetimes are long (1{2 Gyr) and if the survival fraction of
fresh supernova dust passing through supernov reverse
shocks is high (37{89%). However, even this framework
requires that 20{50% of the present-day dust mass of
galaxies has grown in the ISM. These works highlight
the necessity of constraining the role and relative impor-
tance of grain growth in galaxies' chemical evolution.
In recent years, one of the key avenues for understand-
ing the chemical evolution of galaxies has been the rela-
tionship between D/G and metallicity1(see Figure 9 in
Galliano et al. 2018; see also R emy-Ruyer et al. 2014 and
De Vis et al. 2019). Understanding how D/G evolves
with metallicity is especially important with respect to
the `critical metallicity' { the knee in the D/G { Zre-
lationship, at approximately 0.2 Z (R emy-Ruyer et al.
2014; De Vis et al. 2019). Above the critical metallic-
ity, D/G increases linearly with Z, while below it, D/G
drops sharply. A linear trend in D/G { Zis expected in a
regime where the dust-to-metals ratio remains constant;
1This relationship is plotted later, in Figure 12, to display results
presented in subsequent sections of this work.or in other words, where a constant fraction of metals is
locked up in dust grains.
The critical metallicity is generally understood to re-
ect a threshold above which ISM grain-growth becomes
ecient, and starts to dominate over less-ecient stellar
sources of dust, and is expected from theoretical mod-
els (Asano et al. 2013a; Feldmann 2015; Zhukovska et al.
2016). Understanding the critical metallicity has impor-
tant ramications for understanding the ISM in general,
particularly given the role of dust as the formation site of
molecular hydrogen (Gould & Salpeter 1963), as a cool-
ing pathway during star formation (Dopcke et al. 2011),
and in shielding CO from photodissociation { thereby
dictating the CO-to-H 2conversion needed for using CO
as a tracer of molecular gas (Wolre et al. 2010; Clark
& Glover 2015).
There are, however, discrepancies in our current un-
derstanding of the D/G { Zrelationship. The critical
metallicity break is only observed for (mostly nearby)
galaxies for which dust mass measurements are derived
from FIR observations, and for which gas masses are
measured via H iand CO observations (R emy-Ruyer
et al. 2014; De Vis et al. 2019). In contrast, the crit-
ical metallicity break is notobserved for galaxies for
which D/G is derived from depletions, specically in
Damped Lyman Alpha systems (DLAs)2. Rather, for
DLAs, the D/G { Ztrend remains linear, over the en-
tire 0:01< Z < 1 Zrange for which measurements
exist (Galliano et al. 2018; Roman-Duval et al. 2022a),
with no critical metallicity break. Previously, this lin-
ear trend in D/G { Zfor DLAs was found to overlap the
trend for galaxies with D/G determined via FIR ob-
servations; however, recent recalibration indicates that
the DLA trend is actually oset to lower D/G (Roman-
Duval et al. 2022b).
Even within the Local Group (the largest members of
which are shown in Figure 1, excepting the Milky Way),
problems remain in the D/G { Zrelationship. Speci-
cally, the D/G estimates for the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) derived from
FIR observations are considerably lower than D/G val-
ues derived from UV absorption line spectroscopy mea-
surements of depletions (Roman-Duval et al. 2017). The
FIR D/G values are smaller than the UV D/G values by
a factor of2 for the LMC, and a factor of 5 for the
SMC. These osets between D/G are persistent over the
full range of gas densities studied within both Magellanic
Clouds to date (Roman-Duval et al. 2017, 2022b).
Are these D/G discrepancies in the Magellanic Clouds
due to previous FIR measurements being aected by
temperature mixing, or other systematic problems? Or
2DLAs are neutral gas absorption systems with NHI>2
1020cm 2, found over a wide range of redshifts, and observed
via quasar absorption spectroscopy (Wolfe et al. 2005; De Cia
et al. 2016).4 Clark et al.
are the D/G measurements from the UV depletions in
error, meaning that the lower D/G values from the FIR
might be tracing the beginning of the critical metallicity
transition? The LMC and SMC have metallicities of 0.5
and 0.2 Zrespectively, so the SMC in particular might
be in the critical metallicity regime.
There are challenges that need to be addressed when
making D/G measurements with FIR data. If the phys-
ical resolution of FIR observations is not good enough,
it will systematically bias dust mass estimates due to
beam smearing. High-density regions get blurred into
the lower-density regions that surround them, and tem-
perature mixing can cause higher-luminosity emission
from warm dust to dominate the FIR Spectral Energy
Distribution (SED) over fainter emission from greater
masses of cold dust. Additionally, limited physical res-
olution also diminishes the range of ISM densities that
can be sampled. Moreover, galaxies suciently nearby
to overcome such resolution limits (like those in the Lo-
cal Group) often suer from large-angular-scale emis-
sion being ltered out of FIR data during the reduction
process, systematically biasing the data against properly
sampling dust in diuse environments, where ISM densi-
ties will be lowest. Fortunately, by using high-resolution
data and the latest reduction techniques, it is possible
to tackle these issues.
The specics of these obstacles, and how we are able
to overcome them for the sample of Local Group galax-
ies we study in this work, are discussed fully in Sec-
tion 2. In Section 3, we describe our pixel-by-pixel SED
tting, and the dust results obtained from it. In Sec-
tion 4, we examine D/G in our target galaxies, and how
it evolves with ISM density. In Section 5, we investigate
the surprising turnover in D/G exhibited by some of the
galaxies in our sample. In Section 6, we discuss how the
FIR-derived D/G measurements from this (and previ-
ous) work compares to UV-derived D/H measurements.
In Section 7, we provide specic details of the various
maps being publicly released alongside this paper.
Note that in this paper, we specically consider D/G
in terms of the dust-to-hydrogen ratio, D/H. We do this
for several reasons. Firstly, hydrogen mass (or density)
is the actual observable quantity. Frequently, authors
will use a measured hydrogen mass to infer the total
gas mass, by applying a correction factor to account for
the faction of the gas mass made up of elements heav-
ier than hydrogen. However, this fails to consider the
fact that the mass fraction of elements heaver than hy-
drogen evolves as a function of ISM metallicity (Balser
2006) { varying from 1.33 (for low-metallicity galaxies
whereZ!0) to 1.45 (for high-metallicity giant ellipti-
cals where Z= 1:5Z). Moreover, this evolution with
metallicity is not purely monotonic, and will have in-
trinsic scatter due to dierences in nucleosynthesis from
dierent stellar populations. Directly working with D/H
allows us to sidestep the question of this correction, andTable 1. Basic properties of the Local Group galaxies stud-

the ambiguity it can cause. Additionally, later in the pa-
per we compare our dust-to-gas measurements to values
calculated from depletions, where the observed hydro-
gen column is always used as the denominator; so here,
once again, use of D/H allows for more clarity.
2.SAMPLE & DATA
Physical resolution is key for investigating D/H, and
other ISM properties. Superior physical resolution
translates into superior density resolution. With better
resolution, compact higher-density regions of ISM will
appear less `smeared' together with surrounding lower-
density material, allowing a wider range of environments
to be probed. Achieving the best physical and density
resolution therefore requires observing galaxies that are
suitably nearby, using telescopes that have suciently
high angular resolution.
Physical resolution is especially important for observa-
tions of dust emission. Attempts to measure dust masses
(and dust mass surface densities) of nearby galaxies gen-
erally suer from the problem that multiple dust compo-
nents, each with dierent temperatures (and other prop-
erties), will be confused together in the observed FIR
SED. This will bias the dust properties inferred fromThe Quest for the Missing Dust: II 5

that SED; specically, this temperature mixing tends to
cause dust masses to be underestimated (Galliano et al.
2011; Priestley & Whitworth 2020). The best way to
overcome temperature mixing is to observe galaxies us-
ing sucient resolution that the dust in any given reso-
lution element is mostly homogeneous. In practice, Gal-
liano et al. (2011) found that this bias becomes minimal
only when physical resolution is better than 150 pc.
Specically, Galliano et al. (2011) found that increas-
ing physical resolution leads to increased dust masses
from SED tting, with an asymptote at 20 pc (above
this, improving the resolution leads to no further change
in modeled mass). However, physical resolution better
than150 pc results in dust masses for which the error
is<10% divergent from masses obtained at the 20 pc
asymptote; see Figure 6 in Galliano et al. (2011).
These requirements for high spatial resolution mean
that we are eectively limited to observations of galaxies
in the Local Group, if we want to obtain D/H estimates
free of temperature mixing bias.
2.1. Sample Galaxies
For our investigation into the resolved properties of
D/H in nearby galaxies, our sample consists of the four
very well-resolved galaxies of the Local Group { the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), Small Magellanic Cloud(SMC), M 31 (the Andromeda Galaxy), and M 33 (the
Triangulum Galaxy).
These galaxies exhibit a broad range of characteris-
tics. The SMC is a 0.2 Z (Toribio San Cipriano et al.
2017) dwarf galaxy exhibiting the distinct ISM traits
that are characteristic of low-metallicity systems, such
as: the absence of the 2175 A extinction bump along
most (but not all) sightlines (Gordon et al. 2003; Mur-
ray et al. 2019); being extremely irregular, having likely
been disturbed by a recent collision with the LMC (van
der Marel & Cioni 2001; Murray et al. 2019; Choi et al.
2022); and being highly elongated along our line-of-sight
(Scowcroft et al. 2016). The LMC has a metallicity
0.5 Z(Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2017), and is on
the spiral / dwarf-irregular transition; it is experiencing
intense star formation, especially on its eastern edge,
where gas from the SMC appears to be infalling (Bekki
& Chiba 2007; Fukui et al. 2017; Tsuge et al. 2019).
M 33 has a similar 0.5 Z metallicity to the LMC (Kon-
ing 2015; Magrini et al. 2016), but has almost twice the
stellar mass (Corbelli et al. 2014; van der Marel 2006),
and a much more orderly spiral structure; it is an inter-
acting companion of M 31 (Bekki 2008; Putman et al.
2009), and has the highest star-forming eciency in the
Local Group (Gardan et al. 2007). M 31 is a high-mass,
L, spiral/ring galaxy (Gordon et al. 2006) that reaches
super-Solar metallicity (Zurita & Bresolin 2012), and is
currently passing through the green valley (Mutch et al.
2011).
This wide range of properties gives excellent scope to
examine what traits may aect D/H. The sample is il-
lustrated in Figure 1, where the variation in the rel-
ative abundance of dust and gas can be clearly seen
from visual inspection alone. All four galaxies have suf-
ciently low radial velocities (  300< v < 300 km s 1)
that redshift/violetshift is entirely negligible, allowing
us to safely treat all emission as being rest-frame.
2.2. New Herschel Data
The natural choice of telescope for observing dust in
Local Group galaxies is the Herschel Space Observatory
(Pilbratt et al. 2010). Herschel provides exquisite sen-
sitivity (able to reach the extragalactic confusion limit
in most bands), over a 100{500 m wavelength range
which samples the vast majority of dust emission, with
a 3600limiting resolution at 500 m that corresponds to
a physical scale of <150 pc in M 33 (the most distant
of the Local Group's highly extended galaxies), and to
<9 pc in the LMC.
However, FIR observations of Local Group targets
come with their unique complications. Because the
galaxies of the Local Group are so extended, they are
vulnerable to the well-known problem of emission on
large angular scales being ltered out of data produced
by scanning detector arrays across the sky, as Herschel
does (Meixner et al. 2013; Roussel 2013; Smith et al.6 Clark et al.
2017, 2021). The diuse emission lost because of this
eect will naturally tend to correspond to the diuse,
lower-density dust in a galaxy. This will systematically
bias any analysis concerning ISM density.
All-sky FIR surveys, such as those by the InfraRed
Astronomical Satellite (IRAS; Neugebauer et al. 1984)
andPlanck (Planck Collaboration et al. 2011a), are free
from the ltering of large scale emission that aects Her-
schel . However, the resolution of IRAS and Planck is
a factor of10 worse than Herschel , severely limiting
their ability to resolve the densest portions of the ISM
and overcome the temperature mixing problem. Plus,
these facilities provide sparser coverage of the dust SED
than Herschel . These factors severely limit their use in
studying the ISM in nearby galaxies.
Clearly, answering the open questions about D/H will
require reliable Herschel observations of Local Group
galaxies. Therefore, in the rst paper of this series,
Clark et al. (2021, hereafter Paper I), we produced new
versions of the Herschel maps for the Local Group galax-
ies M 31 (Andromeda), M 33 (Triangulum), the LMC,
and the SMC. These new maps were produced by com-
bining Herschel observations, in Fourier space, with data
from lower-resolution FIR telescopes that did not suer
from ltering, to restore the missing large-scale emission.
These new maps also incorporate signicant calibration
corrections (up to 30% in some cases).
The new maps from Paper I cover two Herschel Pho-
todetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS;
Poglitsch et al. 2010) bands, at 100 and 160 m, and all
three Herschel Spectral and Photometric Imaging RE-
ceiver (SPIRE; Grin et al. 2010) bands, at 250, 350,
and 500m. As described in Section 6 of Paper I, we
also produced Galactic-foreground-subtracted versions
of the new maps; it is these that we use throughout this
paper.
To illustrate the feathered FIR data, Herschel 250m
maps for each galaxy are shown in the upper panels of
Figure 2 for the LMC and SMC, and Figure 3 for M 31,
and M 33.
2.3. Molecular & Atomic Gas Data
For the gas component of our target galaxies' ISM,
we created maps of the hydrogen surface density,  H,
by adding together maps of the atomic and molecular
hydrogen, produced from H i21 cm hyperne line and
12C16O(1-0) rotational line (hereafter CO) observations,
respectively. In this work, we use the same  Hmaps as
described in Section 7.1 of Paper I. Here we briey recap
the input data, and how the  Hmaps were produced.
The data we used to create the maps of  Hwas: for
the LMC, the H idata of Kim et al. (2003) and CO data
of Wong et al. (2011); for the SMC, the H idata of Sta-
nimirovic et al. (1999) and the CO data of Mizuno et al.
(2001); for M 31 the H idata of Braun et al. (2009) and
the CO data of Nieten et al. (2006); and for M 33,the H i

data of Koch et al. (2018) and the CO map of Gratier
et al. (2010); Druard et al. (2014). The atomic and
molecular gas emission on all scales should be captured
by these observations; the CO data is all from single-dish
observations, and the H idata is a feathered combina-
tion of high-resolution interferometric observations and
low-resolution single-dish observations. Our handling of
limiting resolutions is discussed in Section 2.4
We calculated the molecular gas surface density
using the standard relation  H2=COICO(1 0),
whereICO(1 0)is the CO(1-0) line velocity-integrated
main-beam brightness temperature (in K km s 1),
andCO is the CO-to-H 2conversion factor (in
K 1km 1s Mpc 2). For the spirals M 31 and M 33,
we used the standard Milky Way COvalue of
3:2 K 1km 1s pc 2; for the LMC and SMC dwarf
galaxies, we used higher COvalues of 6.4 and 21
K 1km 1s pc 2, respectively (Bolatto et al. 2013).
As described in Section 7.1 of Paper I, some authors
prefer anCOfor M 33 that is higher than the Milky
Way value (Bigiel et al. 2010; Druard et al. 2014). How-
ever, Gratier et al. (2010) nd a value within 10% of
that of the Milky Way. Plus Rosolowsky et al. (2003
{ who do not measure an an absolute CO, only its ap-
parent relative variation) nd that COin the highest-
metallicity regions of M 33, at >1.4 Z, is not system-
atically dierent from that in regions at <0.5 Z; given
thatCOat such high metallicities should be compara-
ble to that of the Milky Way, it suggests this is not sig-
nicantly dierent elsewhere in M 33. Regardless, Ap-
pendix B.1 shows that our primary results are mostly
insensitive to changes in CO.The Quest for the Missing Dust: II 7
To add together a galaxy's maps of atomic and molec-
ular hydrogen, to create the combined  Hmap, we rst
convolved the higher-resolution map to the resolution
of the lower-resolution map, assuming a Gaussian PSF,
as per the beam size information in the header of each
map.
Our Hmaps for each galaxy are shown in the lower
panels of Figure 2 for the LMC and SMC, and Figure 3
for M 31, and M 33.
2.4. Convolution to Limiting Resolution
For all analyses, the Herschel and Hmaps were
convolved to a common resolution, to match whatever
the worst resolution was amongst all the data for each
galaxy. We created conversion kernels for this with the
Python package photutils . For the input Herschel
PSFs, we used the azimuthally-averaged beams from
Aniano et al. (2011)3. For the input  HPSFs, we as-
sumed Gaussian beams, as per Section 2.3.
For M 31 and M 33, the limiting resolution was the 3600
of the 500m maps; for the LMC and SMC, the limiting
resolutions were dictated by the gas observations (see
Section 2.3 above), being 10for the LMC, and 2.60for
the SMC. We also re-bin all maps to use a pixel width
equal to that galaxy's limiting resolution, so that every
pixel is statistically independent.
These limiting angular resolutions correspond to phys-
icalresolutions of 14 pc for the LMC, 47 pc for the SMC,
137 pc for M 31, and 147 pc for M 33.
3.SED FITTING
To constrain the dust properties of our target galaxies,
while also taking full advantage of the resolution pro-
vided by our data, we carried out pixel-by-pixel SED-
tting of the FIR maps. For this, we applied a Mod-
ied BlackBody (MBB) model; specically, a Broken-
Emissivity Modied BlackBody (BEMBB) model (Gor-
don et al. 2014).
A MBB is essentially the simplest model that can be
used to reliably t FIR dust emission. It takes the fol-
lowing form, where the surface brightness, S(), of dust
emission at a given wavelength, , can be expressed by:
S() =()B(;Td) d (1)
whereBis the Planck function evaluated at wavelength
and dust temperature Td, dis the dust mass surface
density, and () is the dust mass absorption coecient
at wavelength ;() varies with wavelength according
to an emissivity law:

where(ref) is the value of () at a reference wave-

The MBB model is less directly physically motivated
than dust grain models based on the radiative transfer
and optical properties of dierent potential dust species
(eg, Draine et al. 2014; Jones et al. 2017; De Looze
et al. 2019). However, these various dust grain mod-
els are not currently able to incorporate submillimeter
(submm) excess, wherein more emission is observed in
the Rayleigh-Jeans regime than would be otherwise ex-
pected from models, with the excess increasing towards
longer wavelengths. The phenomena of submm excess is
observed primarily in dwarf galaxies, such as the Mag-
ellanic Clouds (Galliano et al. 2003; Bot et al. 2010;
R emy-Ruyer et al. 2013; Gordon et al. 2014), but is also
seen in lower-density regions of more massive galaxies,
including M 33 (Paradis et al. 2012; Rela~ no et al. 2018).
It is therefore clearly preferable that we use an SED
model that is able to incorporate submm excess emis-
sion4. The BEMBB model achieves this by having the
value ofchange at some break wavelength break; a
shallowerat longer wavelengths captures the excess
emission. As such, the BEMBB emissivity law takes the
form:

while it takes a value of 2at wavelengthsbreak.
4As a test, we repeated the main analyses we present later in this
work, but using a single MBB model instead of BEMBB. We
found that all of the trends in D/H we discuss later in this work
also appear when using single MBB tting, albeit with much
worse quality ts in the lower-density and lower-metallicity envi-
ronments.8 Clark et al.
We perform our SED tting using the Dust Brute
Force Fitter ( DustBFF ), a grid-based Bayesian SED-
tting code; DustBFF , and the mathematical formalism
from which it operates, are presented in Gordon et al.
(2014). We employ DustBFF in the same manner as in
Paper I, so we refer the reader there for a full descrip-
tion of our implementation; the only dierences in this
work are that we used a slightly dierent setup of the
parameter grid (to account for the wider range of den-
sities our Herschel data can probe), and that the data
we tted were of course the Herschel 100{500m bands
(and we therefore used covariance matrices specic to
these bands, given below). We adopt a value of the dust
mass absorption coecient, at a reference wavelength of
160m, of160= 1:24 m2kg 1, following Roman-Duval
et al. (2017); this allows for ease of comparison with their
previous work investigating D/H in the Local Group.
The DustBFF parameter grid we use for all of our sam-
ple galaxies is given in Table 2. Note that BEMBB im-
plementation in DustBFF does not parameterize 2di-
rectly. Rather, the break in is parameterized via the
500m excess,e500, which gives the relative excess in
the 500m ux, above what would arise from a standard
MBB model (with negative values indicating a 500 m
decit);e500is thus dened:
e500=break

DustBFF uses a full covariance matrix in its model
evaluations. This covariance matrix, C, is given by:
C=Ccalib+Cinstr (6)
whereCcalib is a matrix that contains the calibration
uncertainty for each band, and Cinstr is a matrix incor-
porating the eect of the map's instrumental noise on
the probability for each model.
The calibration covariance matrix Ccalibis calculated
by multiplying the proposed uxes for a given model by
the relative calibration uncertainty matrix Ucalib, which
is itself given by summing Uuncorr andUcorr, which are
the matrices containing the fractional uncertainties that
are uncorrelated and correlated between each band.
The diagonal values of the instrumental noise covari-
ance matrix,Cinstr, were calculated for each galaxy in
each band, by taking the median pixel value of the un-
certainty map of each, added in quadrature to the un-
certainty on the foreground subtraction (see Section 6 of
Paper I). The uncertainty maps, as presented in Paper I,
propagate the uncertainty arising from the feathering
process used to restore large-scale emission to the Her-
schel data, along with other the instrumental noise con-
tributions found in standard Herschel uncertainty maps.
The o-diagonals elements of Cinstr are all zero. The di-
agonal elements of Cinstr for each galaxy and band are
given in Table 3.Table 3. Diagonal elements of Cinstr instrumental noise

The uncorrelated uncertainty of a band essentially re-
ects the repeatability of its photometric measurements.
The correlated uncertainties, on the other hand, arise
from uncertainties in the photometric calibration. For
instance, if all the bands of an instrument were cali-
brated using a certain stellar model, but that model is
only constrained to within a certain percentage, then all
of that instruments' bands will share an uncertainty of
that percentage; whatever the actual underlying error is,
it will be the same between bands. Not accounting for
correlated uncertainties can cause severe biases in model
results (Galliano et al. 2011; Kelly et al. 2012; Veneziani
et al. 2013).
For the Herschel -PACS 100 and 160 m bands, the
overall calibration uncertainty is taken as 7%; of this, we
treat 2% as being correlated between bands, as this is the
upper end of the quoted uncertainty on the continuum
model of the 5 late-type giant stars used as the Herschel -
PACS photometric calibrator sources (Balog et al. 2014;
Decin & Eriksson 2007). We therefore assume the un-
correlated component is the quadrature subtraction of
the correlated uncertainty from the total uncertainty,
beingp
7%2 2%2= 6:7%.
For the Herschel -SPIRE 250, 350, and 500 m bands,
we use an overall calibration uncertainty of 5.5%, of
which 4% is taken to be correlated between bands (Grif-
n et al. 2010, 2013; Bendo et al. 2013) { ie, the
Herschel -SPIRE photometric uncertainty is in fact dom-
inated by the correlated component, highlighting the im-
portance of correctly accounting for this eect. This
gives an uncorrelated component ofp
5:5%2 4%2=
3:8%, again applying quadrature subtraction.
Whilst using the full covariance matrices for tting
allows us to account for the often dramatic impacts of
correlated uncertainties, a shortcoming is that it neces-
sarily requires all uncertainties to be treated according
to the same likelihood function { eg, a Gaussian (see
Section 4 of Gordon et al. 2014, specically their Equa-
tion 16). However, the uncertainties on absolute calibra-
tions tend notto be Gaussian. Rather, the true value of
the calibration error will be condently contained within
the stated bounds; this is the case for Herschel -PACS
(Decin & Eriksson 2007) and Herschel -SPIRE (Bendo
et al. 2013). In other words, unlike with a Gaussian
tail, there is not a 32% chance of the true value beingThe Quest for the Missing Dust: II 9
outside the stated range. Ordinarily, this would result
in the total combination of the uncorrelated statistical
(Gaussian) uncertainties and correlated absolute (non-
Gaussian) uncertainties being smaller than if they were
both Gaussian and added in quadrature. However, we
alsowish the total uncertainties, as stated in the diag-
onal elements ofUcalib, to reect the canonical 7% and
5.5% uncertainties for PACS and SPIRE. To reconcile
these two requirements, we use slightly larger uncorre-
lated uncertainties than the standard 2% for PACS (Ba-
log et al. 2014) and 1.5% for SPIRE (Bendo et al. 2013),
such that the quadrature sum of the uncorrelated and
correlated components gives the canonical 7% and 5.5%
values. These larger uncorrelated uncertainties also pro-
vide some leeway to account for additional sources of
uncertainty (such as that caused by uncertainty on the
beam area, which is at least 1%; Bendo et al. 2013).
We therefore use the correlated and uncorrelated rel-
ative uncertainty matrices:

In total, the parameter grid contains 9 million mod-
els, and across our galaxies we t it to 1 million pix-
els. Computing the parameter posterior probability dis-
tributions for all of these pixels for all of our galax-
ies took approximately one month using a 32 3.2 GHz
thread computer. Propagating the full posterior distri-
bution, with likelihoods for every model, for every pixel,
throughout our analyses, would have been impractical.
For each pixel, we therefore drew 1000 random samples
(with replacement) from the full posterior distribution,
with the probability of a given model being drawn be-
ing proportional to its likelihood. This set of random

samples was then propagated as our posterior for all
analyses. We show an example SED for a pixel in M 33,
with the 1000 posterior samples illustrated, in Figure 4,
with a corner plot of that pixel's posterior in Figure 7.
When deciding what pixels of our Herschel data to
t, we imposed a Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) threshold
dictated by the  Hdata. Because the motivation for
our SED-tting here is to explore variation in the D/H
ratio, there was no point tting pixels for which there
was not reliable gas data. In particular, we found that
the very peripheries of the  Hmaps, particularly for
M 31 and M 33, seem to exhibit unphysically low gas
surface density measurements, dropping abruptly to 0
at their edges. This seems to be caused by the sensi-
tivity tailing o at the edge of the input maps' cover-
age areas. And in the Magellanic cloud  Hdata, there
is conspicuous instrumental striping in very low-density
areas; systematic bias from these artefacts seems likely
to dominate over astrophysical emission (even when bin-
ning). We therefore imposed a sensitivity cut of S/N >4
using our  Hmaps. Because our  Hmaps are a com-
bination of the re-projected input maps of atomic and
molecular gas, we calculated the noise ourselves, by mea-
suring the RMS noise within noise-dominated regions
of the maps, where there was no apparent astrophys-
ical signal. Only pixels above the S/N >4 threshold
underwent SED tting and subsequent analysis. Con-
veniently, our  Hmaps are very closely matched in
sensitivity, with the S/N >4 threshold corresponding to
H>2:8 Mpc 2for the LMC,  H>2:6 Mpc 2for
M 31, and  H>2:1 Mpc 2for the SMC and M 33
(note these thresholds are before accounting for inclina-
tion projection eects, as discussed in Section 4.1).10 Clark et al.

3.1. SED Fitting Results
The results of our DustBFF SED tting are shown in
Figures 5 and 6, which shows maps of the median (ie,
50thpercentile) value of each parameter for each pixel,
in each galaxy. Note that maps of the parameter medi-
ans for each pixel tend to be noisier than maps of each
pixels's Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) SED parameter
values; however they also tend to be more representa-
tive of the marginalized distribution for each individual
parameter, hence we chose to display these. While the
SED tting is not the focus of this work in-and-of it-
self, these outputs provide a good check of DustBFF ,
and show some interesting features, so we do make a
few comments here.
Our SED tting appears to do a good job of modeling
the data. For every pixel, we computed the residuals be-
tween the MAP SED model and the data, and measured
the median residual across all pixels for each band, for
each galaxy, and found it to be <2.4% in every case. No
particular sub-region or environment appears to exhibit
noticeable residuals, either.
Overall, our maps of SED parameters are in decent
agreement with those of previous authors who have done
similar resolved SED tting of these galaxies. For therest of this subsection, we perform comparisons to sev-
eral specic works5.
Gordon et al. (2014) previously performed resolved
SED-tting of the Magellanic Clouds as part of the orig-
inal Herschel Inventory of The Agents of Galaxy Evo-
lution (HERITAGE; Meixner et al. 2013) key program.
Although the general ranges of values and broad mor-
phology of our parameter maps agree well, it is dicult
to make more detailed comparisons; the striping/cross-
hatching artefacts found in the original HERITAGE
data are also strongly apparent in their parameter maps;
plus, the S/N limits of the HERITAGE data, especially
for the SMC, renders the modeled areas much smaller
than for our data, with its restored diuse emission and
reduced noise.
We do note that like Gordon et al. (2014), we nd
very low values of 1and2in the SMC, with many pix-
els in the galaxy's outskirts having values only slightly
above 1. We do not believe that this is due to signicant
temperature-mixing causing a at SED shape to be fa-
vored. In order for temperature-mixing to cause 2to be
signicantly atter than 1, the colder dust components
must have a Wein's Law peak at a wavelength >break.
However,>94% of SMC pixels have break>290m.
For dust to have a Wein's Law peak beyond this wave-
length requires a temperature of <10 K. Temperatures
this cold are hard to explain physically, and Bot et al.
(2010) report that in order to explain SED attening
in the SMC, the temperatures would have to be so cold
as to approach the Cosmic Microwave Background. Ad-
ditionally, Gordon et al. (2014) show that the required
mass of dust this cold would exceed the available mass
of ISM metals in the SMC. Similarly, if temperature
mixing of dust at temperatures above 10 K were arti-
cially attening the SED, we would expect signicant
residuals between the models and observations. This is
because even an SED with a shallow will fail to closely
t the at-peaked SED arising from signicant temper-
ature mixing, resulting in residuals (especially when av-
eraged over large numbers of pixels, such as in our data).
However, as discussed earlier in this section, there are
no meaningful residuals evident in our SED ts.
The work of Utomo et al. (2019) provides for a partic-
ularly useful comparison to our own, as they carried out
pixel-by-pixel SED tting of Herschel data for all of the
galaxies in our sample, using an algorithm substantially
similar to DustBFF { albeit without the restoration of
extended emission available in our data, and using an
SED model that assumed a xed = 1:8 with no break
at longer wavelengths. Their  dandTdparameter maps
5Several authors, such as Draine et al. (2014) and Chastenet et al.
(2017), have done resolved SED tting of galaxies in our sample
using physical dust models, with dierent parameter sets to the
MBB-based model we use. Therefore, other than  d, we do not
have parameters in common that can be compared directly.The Quest for the Missing Dust: II 13
(see their Figure 1) are a good match to our own, for
the areas where we both have results. The Utomo et al.
(2019) maps of  d, in particular, are almost a perfect
match in morphology to ours. Our maps also agree with
their general structure for Td, too, although we dier on
some of the specics. For instance, we nd the same
areas of very high Tdin M 33 around star-forming re-
gions, and we also nd the `ridge' of highest tempera-
ture in the SMC to be slightly oset northwest of the
`ridge' of maximal  d. On the other hand, the morphol-
ogy of this SMC temperature structure diers somewhat
between our respective maps, and we also nd M 31 to
have consistently lower Tdthan the other galaxies in the
sample (dust-mass-weighted median of 15.9 K in M 31,
compared to 21.3, 22.0, and 18.4 K for the LMC, SMC,
and M 33 respectively; see Table 4), while Utomo et al.
(2019) do not report such a dierence6. The fact that
we allowto vary, whereas Utomo et al. (2019) keep it
xed, could account for this dierence in temperature,
given the strong degeneracy between those two param-
eters.
The colder dust temperatures we nd for M 31 do,
however, agree well with Smith et al. (2012), Viaene
et al. (2014), and Whitworth et al. (2019)7, which nd
16 K dust temperatures over most of the disc, with a
much smaller warmer region in the center, small enough
that it would mostly fall within the low- Hregion we
do not t. Our results also agree with the nding from
Smith et al. (2012) and Whitworth et al. (2019) that 
decreases with radius in M 31. Indeed, whereas both of
those studies used an unbroken- model, we nd that
both1and2fall with radius. Additionally, thanks
to our restoration of the diuse emission, we are able to
perform our SED modeling out to a radius of over 32 kpc,
compared to the 18 kpc of Smith et al. (2012), and 20 kpc
of Whitworth et al. (2019), nding that the trends of
decreasingTdandcontinue out to larger extreme radii.
We are also able to successfully perform SED tting in
low S/N pixels within diuse regions between the star-
forming rings of M 31, that those previous studies did
not model.
For M 33, although we nd that Tdand1generally
fall with radius, in line with the ndings of Tabatabaei
et al. (2014) (who also used a single-MBB, unbroken- 
model), we nd that 2does not fall conspicuously with
radius, instead being depressed around regions of height-
ened star formation (the same regions with elevated dust
6We do not t the SED of many of the pixels in the gas-poor centre
of M 31, where dust will be warmest, because they fell below the
S/N threshold in  H. However, outside this central region there
is extensive area where both Utomo et al. (2019) and ourselves
modeled the SED, where we still nd 5 K dierence.
7Smith et al. (2012) and Whitworth et al. (2019) use an unbroken
variablefor their MBB models, while Viaene et al. (2014) adopt
a xed-MBB model.Table 4. Dust and gas parameters for each of our galaxies.
The total dust mass, Md, is the sum of the median posterior
mass value of every pixel; the D/H is this value divided by
the sum of the same pixels in the  Hmap. For the other

pixel medians.

these environments.
3.1.1. Global Dust and Gas Values
In Table 4, we provide global SED parameters for our
galaxies. We report the total dust mass, Md, where for
each galaxy we take the sum of the posterior median
dust mass for each pixel. For the D/H values (discussed
more fully in Section 4), we divide this by the total hy-
drogen mass computed from the same pixels in our  H
maps. For the other SED parameters, we give the dust-
mass-weighted average of the posterior medians for each
pixel. In all cases, we only consider pixels that exceed
our previously-discussed  HS/N criterion8.
To make sure that our imposition of the S/N criterion
does not signicantly aect the global D/H values, we
also recalculated them using all pixels in the dust and
gas maps for which the  Hmap had S/N >1; this much
weaker threshold is intended to make sure we are not
excluding signicant amounts of diuse emission, while
also still avoiding artefacts and other image errors in low
S/N regions introducing signicant bias into the mea-
surements. To prevent contamination from any Galactic
foreground emission that had not been fully subtracted,
we also only counted pixels for M 31 and M 33 that are
within the elliptical apertures employed for photometry
in Section 6.3 of Paper I. The resulting D/H were all
with in 3% of those we found when using the S/N >4
criterion, indicating a very minimal contribution from
the masked pixels.
Gordon et al. (2014) also performed their SED tting
with DustBFF , using a BEMBB model. This allows for
8For M 31, the application of the  HS/N cut does mean that there
are pixels in the center of the galaxy for which the dust content is
not incorporated into Table 4, due to their low hydrogen column
density. However as these pixels comprise <2% of the total dust
mass of M 31, their omission has minimal impact on the global
values.14 Clark et al.
a good direct comparison of our global results to results
obtained using the older, unfeathered Herschel maps of
the Magellanic Clouds. The dust masses we nd for the
LMC and SMC are factors of 1.59 and 1.48 smaller , re-
spectively, than the total dust masses found by Gordon
et al. (2014), after correcting for our diering values of
(ref). Similarly, in comparison to the dust masses
from the resolved SED tting of Utomo et al. (2019; in
which they model the illuminating interstellar radiation
eld, as per Draine & Li 2007), ours are smaller by fac-
tors of 3.3 for the LMC, 3.9 for the SMC, 1.46 for M 31,
and 3.8 for M 33 (again, after scaling to our (ref))
The fact we tend to nd nd lower masses may seem
surprising at rst, given that the new Herschel maps
from Paper I restored dust emission that was missing
in older maps. However, there was more emission that
needed restoring in the shorter wavelength bands (espe-
cially in the Herschel -PACS 100 and 160 m data) than
at longer wavelengths. As a result, essentially all the
dust emission from our galaxies is rendered signicantly
bluer in the new maps (see Figure 17 of Paper I). Bluer
emission corresponds to warmer dust temperatures; and
as the luminosity of a given mass of dust goes approxi-
mately/T4+
d, this reduces the modeled dust mass for
a given FIR brightness.
To check this, we directly compared the dust-mass-
weighed dust temperatures we nd, to those of Gor-
don et al. (2014), by reprojecting their parameter maps
to our pixel grid, and only comparing pixels for which
both had coverage. We found that our mass-weighted-
average global dust temperatures were 2.0 K warmer for
the LMC, and 5.5 K warmer for the SMC. These cor-
respond to factor 1.11 and 1.29 dierences in temper-
ature, respectively. Assuming there were no other dif-
ference, then the simple /T4+
drelation would suggest
that we should expect our dust masses to be factors of
2.1 and 5.5 reduced due to this eect, assuming typical
= 1:7. We don't perform the same direct comparison
with the Utomo et al. (2019) maps, due to dierences
between the foreground subtractions & eective aper-
tures we use, and dierences in method. For instance,
by using a broken-emissivity approach (as compared to
their xed=1.8 method), it is possible for ux at longer
wavelengths to be accounted for by the becoming at-
ter, instead of by driving up the total SED normaliza-
tion { and hence mass. The new Herschel maps from
Paper I generally increase the total FIR ux measured
in each pixel, with per-band averages increases of 21%,
which will counteract some of the mass reduction due
to higher temperature. Plus, Paper I applied calibration
corrections to the Herschel data, which will also have
knock-on eects to the SED parameters (generally in-
creasing 100{160 m uxes, but increasing 250{500 m
uxes. So overall, the reduction in dust mass we nd is
of order the dierence that should be expected.Table 5. Spearman rank correlation coecients between the

On the other hand, comparing to the total dust masses
reported by Chastenet et al. (2017), who used the
THEMIS physical dust grain model (Jones et al. 2017),
our LMC dust mass is 20% greater than theirs, although
our SMC dust mass is a factor of 1.67 less, after (ref)
corrections9. Chastenet et al. (2017) note that their
masses are signicantly lower than other authors, which
they ascribe to the high fraction of more-emissive car-
bonaceous grains in their modeling results (which may
be reasonable, given recent results from Roman-Duval
et al. 2022b nding LMC and SMC dust to be more
carbon-rich than that of the Milky Way, at a given col-
umn density).
3.1.2. Submillimeter Excess
Signicant submm excess is apparent in the outskirts
of all of our galaxies, especially the lowest-metallicity
SMC. This is in line with previous work showing that
greater submm excess tends to be found in lower-
metallicity environments (Galliano et al. 2003; Bot et al.
2010; R emy-Ruyer et al. 2013; Gordon et al. 2014). How-
ever, several works have also found good evidence that
submm excess can be driven by ISM density, with more
excess found in lower-density environments (Planck Col-
laboration et al. 2011b; Rela~ no et al. 2018). Our im-
proved data put us in a good position to compare these
possibilities.
Thanks to our restoration of diuse emission, we are
able to conduct SED tting out to larger radii than pre-
viously performed. For instance, we are able to model
dust emission in the H ilament to the southeast of the
LMC, where it is interacting with the lower-metallicity
Magellanic Stream (Nidever et al. 2008), in which we
nd elevated levels of submm excess. Similarly, in M 31,
we are able to perform our SED modeling out to a radius
of over 32 kpc, compared to 18 kpc in Smith et al. (2012),
9The ratio of silicate to carbonaceous dust is dierent in every
pixel modeled by Chastenet et al. (2017); as per their Section
5.2, we assume an average 2:1 ratio of carbonaceous to silicate
dust, which agrees with the range of average ratios they quote
for both galaxies. Using the average THEMIS emissivity slope
of= 1:78 (Nersesian et al. 2019) to convert via Equation 2,
this gives an average 160= 2:84 m2kg 1. We compare to their
favored multi-ISRF masses.The Quest for the Missing Dust: II 15
and 20 kpc in Whitworth et al. (2019) and Draine et al.
(2014) At these previously-unprobed extreme radii, we
again nd that submm excess increases to higher levels.
Note that with our BEMBB model, submm excess cor-
responds to 2<1. Whilst our model grid does allow
for21(ie, a submm decit), this only happens
for<3.7% of pixels in the median e500maps across
all four of our galaxies (being as few as 0.03% of pix-
els for the SMC). In other words, the dust SED eec-
tively always becomes shallower towards longer wave-
lengths (agreeing with Planck Collaboration et al. 2014).
We nd that the break wavelength is in the range
260m<break<325m for 80% of pixels, with break
generally being lower in areas of greater ISM density, al-
beit with elevated break often seen immediately around
star-forming regions (see Figure 5).
Spearman rank correlation tests nd that the strength
of the submm excess in M 31 and M 33 is more strongly
correlated with deprojected radius than with  H; for the
LMC, we nd that the correlation is stronger with den-
sity than with radius, although the dierence is smaller.
However we note that the LMC is much more disturbed
than either of the spirals. Correlation coecients are
given in Table 5. We do not test correlation with ra-
dius for the SMC, due to its high degree of disturbance
preventing us from meaningly quantifying radii.
The fact the correlation with radius is stronger than
with ISM density for M 31 and M 33, but not the LMC
(which lacks a signicant metallicity gradient; see Sec-
tion 4.1.1), potentially suggest that metallicity is play-
ing a role, either through dierent dust composition, or
through improved shielding. These possibilities are sup-
ported by the fact that we nd even stronger correlation
ofe500with D/H and  d(Table 5). We caution against
over-interpretation of these nal two correlations, how-
ever, as both depend upon  d, which is a parameter in
our SED tting model along with e500, and the two can
be degenerate (eg, Figure 7). We also see in M 31 and
M 33 that there are narrow regions of elevated e500trac-
ing the spiral arms (see Figure 6), despite these being
higher-density regions. If shielding in dust-rich regions
can drive down submm excess, then it is conceivable that
proximity to radiation and shocks from ongoing star for-
mation elevates e500in certain parts of the spiral arms,
possibly in lower-density regions carved by young stellar
winds, on smaller scales than what our data can resolve
in these galaxies.
We note that the S/N of the FIR emission at larger
radii tends to be very low, leading to large uncertain-
ties on the modeled parameters for any individual pixel.
However, the fact that the trend of increasing submm
excess is evident at all azimuth, across thousands of in-
dependent pixels, gives us reason to be condent in the
trend, and that it is not an artifact of our foreground
subtraction, or arising from localized cosmic microwave
background uctuations, etc.4.EVOLUTION IN THE DUST-TO-GAS RATIO
With maps of both the dust and hydrogen content of
our galaxies, we can now explore the behavior of the
dust-to-gas ratio within them. In Figure 8, we show
maps of D/H for our targets.
For the two spirals, we nd that D/H is elevated in
the central regions, and tends to fall with increasing ra-
dius, in line with the broad trends observed by previous
authors (Draine et al. 2014; Gratier et al. 2017). This
trend is particularly pronounced in M 31, while in M 33
elevated D/H more closely follows the spiral structure,
rather than being purely radial.
For the LMC, the structure of the D/H map broadly
traces the morphology of the dust mass (see Figure 8),
but with some other noteworthy features. The highest
D/H is often found at the very edges of supershells ex-
cavated by recent star formation10. These supershells
are apparent especially in poor H i(Dawson et al. 2013);
the low gas density within the shells means that they
mostly fall below our S/N threshold in  H. The high
D/H at the edges of these shells might indicate that the
gas is being blown away more eciently than the dust
(Draine 2011). Alternatively, our dust and gas mass
tracers might behave dierently here; for instance, envi-
ronmental grain processing might be aecting the dust
opacity (see Section B.6).
Another noteworthy feature in the map for the LMC is
the signicantly depressed D/H to the southeast. This
is coincident with the portion of the disc where low-
metallicity material from the Magellanic Stream is be-
ing accreted onto the LMC (Bekki & Chiba 2007; Nide-
ver et al. 2008). This accretion is leading to the en-
hanced star-formation of 30 Doradus and the surround-
ing area (Fukui et al. 2017; Tsuge et al. 2019, 2020). Al-
though the area of star-formation itself has fairly high
D/H>10 2:3, the southeastern fringes of the LMC have
the lowest D/H found in the entire galaxy. Indeed, the
southernmost tip of this region features D/H as low as
10 3:3, matching the typical D/H we nd for the SMC.
The D/H map of the SMC shows it to have conspic-
uously lower D/H than any of the other galaxies in the
sample, as we would expect from its 0.2 Z metallicity.
Thanks to our new Herschel maps from Paper I, and the
sensitive  Hdata, we are able to trace D/H out to very
large radii. Away from the main regions of star for-
mation along the Bar and Wing, D/H falls steadily, to
values of less than 10 4in the most diuse regions.
4.1. Evolution of D/H with H
In Figure 9, we present the central result of this paper
{ the evolution of D/H with  Hfor our galaxies. As
10As we discuss later in Section 6.1, with relation to Figure 15, D/H
at the edge of these supershells is even elevated above what would
be expected for their  H, based on the LMC's global relationship
between D/H and  H.16 Clark et al.

D/H
Figure 8. Maps of the dust-to-hydrogen ratio for our target galaxies. All four are displayed using the same color scale, to allow
for direct comparison.
covered in Section 1, we should expect D/H to increase
with greater  H, due to the increased eciency of the
accretion of gas-phase metals onto dust grains in higher-
density ISM. To construct this plot, we binned the values
from our D/H maps according to the  Hof each pixel,
into bins of width 0.025 dex. The plotted points in Fig-
ure 9 show the median value in each bin. The error bars
incorporate the uncertainty on the median, calculated
by performing 500 Monte-Carlo bootstrap resamples of
all the D/H values in each bin, recomputing the me-
dian each time, then nding the standard deviation of
those 500 bootstrapped medians; this was then added
in quadrature to the 0.05 dex uncertainty arising from
the fact that our  dvalues were taken from a model
grid with a 0.05 dex step size (see Table 2), which lim-
its the precision of any given D/H measurement. The
scatter within each bin can be quite large; across all 4
galaxies, the average standard deviation of the D/H val-ues contained within a bin is 0.8 dex. Despite this, the
distribution of values within each bin tends to be well-
behaved and Gaussian; hence the average uncertainty on
the bin medians, as measured via the bootstrap resam-
pling, is only 0.02 dex (ie, the uncertainty on the median
for each bin is almost always dominated by the 0.05 dex
contribution of the uncertainty on the grid step size).
The x-axis surface density values in Figure 9 have had
a deprojection correction applied, to account for the ef-
fect of each galaxy's inclination11. For an inclined disc
galaxy like M 31, the column of ISM sampled by a given
pixel passes through a greater thickness of disc than it
would for an equivalent face-on galaxy. This compro-
mises our ability to treat observed surface density as
11The same correction has also been applied to the x-axis  Hvalues
in Figures 11, 13, 14, B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5.The Quest for the Missing Dust: II 17
a proxy for average volume density (as volume density
is what will be dictating grain-growth, etc), and would
prevent us from fairly comparing our galaxies' D/H at a
given observed  H. Therefore, for a given galaxy incli-
nationi(see Table 1), we apply a deprojection correc-
tion:
(deproj )
H = cos (i) H (10)
Hereafter, we refer to (deproj )
H in instances where com-
parison between galaxies makes the distinction between
corrected and uncorrected  Hvalues important. The
cos (i) correction factor equates to 0.22, 0.56, and 0.90
for M 31, M 33, and the LMC, respectively. No correc-
tion needs to be applied to the y-axis quantity of D/H,
as this is a ratio of two quantities that experience the
same projection, cancelling out its eect.
Because the SMC's highly disturbed morphology lacks
a disc, inclination simply isn't an applicable concept,
so we apply no correction. In addition, thanks to
the SMC's extreme elongation along the line-of-sight
(Scowcroft et al. 2016), the link between observed sur-
face density and actual volume density is further weak-
ened in the case of the SMC; the reader should bear that
the entire trend for the SMC in Figure 9 could be shifted
left or right by this poorly-constrained systematic.
Figure 9 shows clearly that there is very strong evo-
lution in the dust-to-gas ratio with (deproj )
H for all of
our sample galaxies. Indeed, M 31 shows almost an or-
der of magnitude of evolution in D/H between densi-
ties of 0.6{4 M pc2, while the SMC exhibits even more
than that, with its D/H increasing by a factor of 20
between 3{150 M pc2. For all four galaxies, D/H in-
creases steadily with density { although only up until a
point for M 31, M 33, and the LMC. All three of these all
exhibit a turnover in D/H, after which it begins to de-
crease with increasing  H(this is explored in Section 5).
Regardless, the increase in D/H with (deproj )
H over most
densities for all four galaxies provides evidence for sig-
nicant density-dependent dust grain growth.
These results update our understanding of just how
much D/H canvary within a galaxy, especially at xed
metallicity. Previous authors have found the dust-to-gas
ratio varying by a factor of 3 in the LMC (Roman-Duval
et al. 2017), a factor of 5 in M 31 (Draine et al. 2014),
a factor of 7 in the SMC (Roman-Duval et al. 2014,
2017), and a factor of 10 in M 101 (Chiang et al. 2018;
Chastenet et al. 2021; albeit over a factor of 5 variation
in metallicity, whereas our variation is seen even with
little-or-no metallicity variation, as per Section 4.1.1).
We now nd D/H spans a factor of 2.5 in M 33, a factor
of 3.5 in the LMC, a factor of 9.0 in M 31, and a factor
of 22.4 in the SMC.
4.1.1. Eect of Metallicity Gradients on Evolution in D/H
If there were signicant systematic variation in the
ISM metallicity of our target galaxies, then an increasein D/H might not indicate grain growth { instead, if re-
gions of greater density also had higher metallicity, then
D/H would be correspondingly greater even if the frac-
tion of metals in dust grains was staying constant (in
other words, even if there was no grain growth). How-
ever, this is not the case for our galaxies.
Neither the ISM (Pagel et al. 1978; Toribio San Cipri-
ano et al. 2017) nor younger stellar clusters (Grocholski
et al. 2006; Cioni 2009) in the LMC exhibit a signi-
cant radial metallicity gradient ( <0.2 dex, less than the
intrinsic scatter). Although metallicity does appear de-
pressed in its southeast periphery, where the LMC is
interacting with low-metallicity gas of the Magellanic
Stream (Nidever et al. 2008; Tsuge et al. 2019, 2020;
Roman-Duval et al. 2021), this is true for both high-
and low-density gas in this region, so should not sys-
tematically inuence the D/H evolution prole of the
LMC. For the SMC, there is no signicant metallicity
gradient observed in the ISM (Pagel et al. 1978; Cioni
2009; Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2017).
There is a denite radial metallicity gradient in the
ISM of M 31, however it is only -0.56 dex R 1
25(Zurita &
Bresolin 2012)12; so clearly this cannot account for the
0.9 dex evolution in D/H in M 31. Moreover, metallicity
does not scale monotonically with  Hin M 31, thanks
to the low ISM density of the inner 3 kpc { further
reducing the potential for the radial metallicity gradient
to give rise to increased D/H in regions of greater  H.
The ISM of M 33 has an even smaller radial metal-
licity gradient, at -0.22 dex R 1
25(Magrini et al. 2016);
similar to M 31, this is unable to account for the 0.4 dex
evolution in D/H we see within this galaxy, especially
because the gradient is comparable to the intrinsic scat-
ter in metallicity at any given radius (Magrini et al.
2016).
We therefore are do not believe that metallicity eects
are a primary driver of the evolution in D/H observed
in Figure 9.
4.1.2. Eect of Dust Destruction at Lower Densities on
Evolution in D/H
Whilst there are compelling reasons to expect D/H to
increase at higher densities due to more ecient inter-
stellar grain growth, we should also expect dust grain
destruction to become more ecient at lower densities.
Therefore, a trend of D/H increasing with density could
potentially be driven by either eect.
The primary forces of dust destruction in the ISM are
expected to be sputtering due to supernov shocks, and
photo-destruction by high-energy photons (Jones 2004;
Bocchio et al. 2014; Slavin et al. 2015a).

Generally, theoretical models expect the eciency of
grain destruction due to supernov shocks to only be
relatively weakly dependent upon density. Typically,
destruction eciency is modeled to fall with increasing
density, according to a power-law slope of around  0:1
(Jones et al. 1994; Dwek et al. 2007; Temim et al. 2015).
In contrast, all four of our galaxies show evolution in
D/H with (deproj )
H with power law slopes ranging from
0.4 for the LMC, up to 1.0 for M 31 (up until the D/H
turnover; see Section 5). This implies that either dust
destruction due to supernov is not driving the vast ma-
jority of D/H evolution with density we nd, or that the
density-dependence of supernov dust-destruction e-
ciency has been under-estimated by theoretrical models.
The rate of interstellar dust destruction should also be
expected to closely correlate with the density of young
stars in a given environment. This is because young
stars will produce high-energy photons capable of photo-
destruction of grains, and because young stars indicatewhere dust-destroying core-collapse supernov should
be occurring at the greatest rate.
UV emission traces young stars, that have formed
within the past 100 Myr (Kennicutt 1998; Calzetti
et al. 2005; Buat et al. 2011). Therefore UV obser-
vations should allow us to trace the relative rate of
dust destruction we should expect in dierent loca-
tions. The only high-quality high-resolution wide-area
UV data available for all four of our sample galaxies
comes from the UltraViolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT;
Roming et al. 2000, 2004) on the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory (Gehrels et al. 2004). For the Magellanic
Clouds, the Swift -UVOT data we use is the data pre-
sented in Hagen et al. (2017); for M 31 and M 33, we
use reductions created according to the same method as
in Hagen et al. (2017), with that data to be fully be
presented in Decleir et al. ( in prep. ; for data access see
Section 7). The data for M 31 and M 33 cover the full
stellar discs of both galaxies; the SMC data covers theThe Quest for the Missing Dust: II 19

whole bar and part of the wing, whilst the LMC data
covers the bar, 30 Doradus, and the surrounding regions.
To trace the young stars, we use the Swift -UVOT W2
band maps. Being the UVOT band with the shortest
eective wavelength, at 192 nm, W2 should best trace
the higher-energy photons that will lead to dust destruc-
tion. We converted the Swift -UVOT W2 count-rate data
to SI units, as per the AB magnitude zero points given
in Breeveld et al. (2011), and thence to UV luminosity
surface density, in L pc 2. We then reprojected these
maps to the same pixel grid as our D/H maps, and ap-
plied deprojection corrections.
In Figure 10, we plot D/H against UV luminosity den-
sity for each of our galaxies. To our surprise, we nd
that regions of great UV luminosity density tend to have
larger D/H. This trend is signicant for all four galax-
ies; in every case, Spearman rank correlation tests nd
Pnull<10 10, with correlation coecients ranging from
0.37{0.50. On large scales, we might expect this sort of
correlation, as the denser ISM where grain-growth can
occur is also the material that should be fueling ongoing
star formation. But in data with resolution as high as
ours, as good as 14 pc in the LMC, it is surprising to
nd that regions with recent star formation, and corre-
sponding higher density of supernov shocks and hard
radiation, still manage to have higher D/H.
The origin of this surprising nding warrants further
investigation in future work. One conceivable explana-
tion is that we are tracing the creation of fresh dust
by core-collapse supernov, which will be preferentiallyfound in regions of recent star formation. If so, this
has major implications for the role of supernov as
net creators, versus destroyers, of dust (Nozawa et al.
2006; Priestley et al. 2021). Dust creation by asymp-
totic giant branch (ABG) stars, seems unlikely to be
the cause. This is because D/H is visibly well corre-
lated with the ISM structure in our galaxies; AGB stars,
however, will have a distribution following that of each
galaxy's evolved stellar population, which has a very dif-
ferent distribution in these galaxies.
We also note that Figure B4 in Appendix B.4 like-
wise suggests that greater ionized gas surface density,
as traced by H observations of the LMC and SMC,
does not appear to be associated with reduced D/H,
and any (deproj )
H . However, as this data is not available
for M 31 and M 33, and with poorer resolution than pro-
vided by Swift -UVOT, we consider this a secondary line
of evidence.
For all four galaxies, these results suggest that neither
dust destruction by young stars (via hard radiation or
shocks from core-collapse supernov), nor greater e-
ciency of dust destruction in lower-density ISM, nor the
presence of ionized gas, are the primary driver of the
evolution in D/H with (deproj )
H observed in Figure 9.
This supports the explanation that this relationship is
tracing increasing dust grain growth at higher densities.
4.1.3. Variation in D/H Evolution Between Galaxies
There are some striking similarities and dierences
between the relationships in how D/H evolves with
(deproj )
H for each of the galaxies in Figure 9. The
rst thing of note is how extremely similar the pro-
les of M 31 and M 33 are to each other. Over the
0.6{30 Mpc 2range in (deproj )
H , they overlap near-
perfectly13. They even experience their D/H turnovers
at the same surface density, 4 Mpc 2. This would
supercially suggest that the ISM in these galaxies has
similar properties. This is, however, rather surprising,
given that M 31 has an average metallicity more than
2.5 times greater than M 33, and a stellar mass more
than 25 times greater.
The representative dust SED parameters for M 31 and
M 33 do indeed dier (see Table 4), most notably in
terms of. M 31 has higher values (ie, a steeper
Rayleigh-Jeans slope), with minimal dierence between
1and2. M 33, on the other hand, as much lower val-
ues of, more characteristic of lower-mass and dwarf
galaxies (R emy-Ruyer et al. 2013). Plus, M 33 has a
much more pronounced break to a shallower 2at longer
13We are able to probe to lower densities for M 31 than M 33, pri-
marily because of M 31's greater inclination. Surface densities
that would not be detectable in a less-inclined galaxy can be ob-
served in M 31, as the sampled ISM column is longer at higher
inclination. Our deprojection corrections, discussed earlier in
Section 4.1, allow us to compare galaxies directly despite this.20 Clark et al.
wavelength; again more characteristic of dwarf galaxies
(Gordon et al. 2014). This is extremely interesting, as
can potentially trace actual physical properties of the
dust grains in question. In general, higher values of 
are expected from crystalline grains, silicate species, or
coagulated grains; while lower values of are expected
from metallic grains, amorphous grains, and carbona-
ceous species (Tielens & Allamandola 1987; K ohler et al.
2015; Jones et al. 2017; Ysard et al. 2018). The well-
known temperature{ degeneracy (Shetty et al. 2009;
Smith et al. 2013) limits what we can infer from the pa-
rameters derived from any one pixel. However, because
we sample very large numbers of pixels, and because
the pixels are larger than the instrumental PSF (and
hence statistically independent) the overall trends we
nd ought to be robust against the temperature{ de-
generacy (Smith et al. 2012). This is because the degen-
eracy does not impart a biasto the results of the ts; any
trend observed over very large numbers of pixels cannot
therefore be caused by the degeneracy. Large-scale vari-
ation intherefore hints at dierent dust compositions
(either because of their elemental compositions, or the
environments in which the grains formed; see Roman-
Duval et al. 2022b. But despite this, the global D/H
ratios for M 31 and M 33 are eectively identical, be-
ing 10 2:11versus 10 2:13{ matching their similarity in
D/H versus (deproj )
H prole.
In contrast, if any two galaxies in our sample might be
expected to have ISM that behaves similarly, it would be
M 33 and the LMC. Their stellar masses, metallicities,
and star-formation rates (Harris & Zaritsky 2009; Verley
et al. 2009) are very similar. Both galaxies are bound to
massive spiral companions, with which they have under-
gone interactions (although M 33 is more distant from
its companion, and considerably less disturbed, with
the last major encounter likely >1 Gyr ago; Bekki 2008;
McConnachie et al. 2009). However, despite their simi-
larity, the two galaxies show strikingly dierent proles
in their D/H evolution in Figure 9. The prole of the
LMC would appear depressed compared to that of M 33
by a factor of 1.5{3. And while both galaxies have a
turnover in D/H, the location of that turnover is at a
deprojected surface density of 40 M pc 2for the LMC,
compared to just 4 M pc 2for M 33 (and M 31). More-
over, M 33 (and M 31) shows very steep increase in D/H
with (deproj )
H before the turnover, with a power law in-
dex of 1.1 over the 0.6{4.0 M pc 2range; whereas the
D/H increase for the LMC happens much more gradu-
ally, with a power law index of only 0.39 over the 2.5{
40 Mpc 2range.
The fact that two galaxies as supercially-similar as
M 33 and the LMC can have such starkly dierent D/H
properties is signicant, especially in the context of the
common practice of inferring a galaxy's gas mass from
observations of dust emission (Eales et al. 2010; Scoville
et al. 2014). This is a standard method for estimatingthe ISM mass of galaxies for which direct measurements
of CO and/or H iare not available. It has been shown
to be remarkably reliable for massive galaxies at high
masses (Scoville et al. 2014, 2016), but clearly extending
the technique to more intermediate masses will have to
be done with care, given that even fundamental galaxy
properties like metallicity and stellar mass are not accu-
rate predictors of a galaxy's D/H ratio. Moreover, while
D/H for M 33 and the LMC only dier by a factor of 2,
it should be remembered that the method of estimat-
ing gas mass from dust emission tends not to use dust
mass , but instead simply use dust luminosity in some
longer-wavelength band such as 500 or 850 m { and
the 500m luminosities of M 33 and the LMC dier by
a factor of>3.
Lastly, the SMC clearly follows a very dierent evo-
lutionary prole than the other galaxies. Not only does
D/H continue to increase over the entire factor of 50
in surface density we sample, but moreover the gra-
dient of the prole continues to get steeper, even up
to the very highest density we are able to trace. In-
deed, above 150 M pc 2, the highest (deproj )
H available
for the SMC, the D/H prole for the SMC appears as
though it may intersect that of the LMC. This suggests
that grain growth may have a particularly strong de-
pendence with density in the SMC. We can also be sure
that the dust grains themselves have dierent properties
in the SMC. Not only do most regions in the SMC ap-
pear to lack the 2175 A extinction bump seen in higher-
metallicity systems (Gordon et al. 2003; Murray et al.
2019), but our SED tting nds the SMC to have a
much lower than the other galaxies in our sample,
along with the most signicant attening in at longer
wavelengths (see Table 4 and Figure 6), all indicating a
dierent composition.
4.2. Modeling the Evolution in D/H
In order to aid our understanding of the D/H evolution
proles in Figure 9, we use the dust evolution model of
Asano et al. (2013b) . This model traces how various
galactic environmental parameters can aect accretion
of metals onto dust grains { such as the density of the
ISM, the metallicity of the gas, the temperature of the
existing dust grains, and the characteristic lifetime of
the molecular clouds where grain growth occurs, and
the average grain size. The model balances this with
the rate at which supernov can destroy dust grains,
given the density and metallicity of the ISM.
Using this model, the timescale for accretion of metals
onto dust grains, acc, is given by:
acc=
2107a
0:1mnH
100 cm 3 1Td
50 K 1
2Z
0:02 1
(11)The Quest for the Missing Dust: II 21
whereais the average dust grain size in m,nHis the
volumetric number density of hydrogen in cm 3, andZ
is the metallicity (in units of the metal mass fraction).
Withacc, one can then compute the fraction of the
metal mass that is in dust grains (see Zhukovska et al.
2008), using:
fd=etgrowth=accfd0
1 fd0+ (fd0etgrowth=acc)(12)
wheretgrowth is the average duration of episodes of
grain-growth (if grain-growth happens predominantly in
molecular clouds, then tgrowth corresponds to the aver-
age molecular cloud lifetime), and fd0is the minimum
fraction of metals that can be locked up in dust grains.
Given this, the D/H for a given set of parameters is
simply given by:
D
H=fdZ (13)
which naturally gives the result that D/H will peak at a
value equal to the metallicity, when all metals are locked
up in dust grains at fd= 1. This grain growth trend in
the Asano et al. (2013b) model is qualitatively similar
to that found in the Nanni et al. (2020) model, also.
Because we are observing surface densities, we are
unable to directly measure nH. We therefore need
to incorporate a conversion factor H)n, in units of
cm 3M 1
pc2, such that:
nH=H)n(deproj )
H (14)
Clearly, there are many potentially-tunable parame-
ters involved. Fortunately, we are not necessarily inter-
ested in ascertaining the `true' values of these various
parameters. Rather, we are concerned with identifying
the general shape of the evolutionary trend we'd expect,
and what relative dierences in the parameters could
potentially lead to the dierences in D/H evolutionary
proles we nd.
In order to nd the best t of this model framework
to each of our galaxies, we use a model grid consist-
ing of reasonable values of each of the parameters. The
grid parameters are given in Table A1; a full discussion
of motivation of the parameter ranges is given in Ap-
pendix A.
We assume an average grain radius of a= 0:1m
(Inoue 2011; Nozawa et al. 2011; Asano et al. 2013b).
For each bin, we took the median of the median dust
temperature from the SED-tting of every pixel in the
bin, and used this for that bin's Tdvalue.
For each bin, we also assume a known metallicity.
Given the lack of systematic variation in metallicity
within the LMC and SMC, as discussed above, we use
the xed values of 0.5 and 0.2 Z , respectively, for all
density bins in these galaxies. For M 31 and M 33, we
also use xed metallicities for all density bins, using therepresentative global metallicities, of 1.3 and 0.5 Z , re-
spectively, even though these galaxies do have metal-
licity gradients. This is because each bin contains pix-
els representing a complex distribution of metallicities.
For instance, in M 31, there are low-density pixels with
H0:1 M 1
pc2located in the galaxy's gas-poor cen-
ter whereZ > 1:5 Z, and in the galaxy's gas-poor out-
skirts where Z < 0:75 Z. The mixture of metallicities
at each density varies considerably, and taking the av-
erage, for instance, of the metallicities within each bin
leads to pathological model behavior. So instead, we
use the xed metallicities, which is in keeping with the
understanding that this modeling is intended to be rep-
resentative, as opposed to accurately capturing the spe-
cic physical conditions in these systems.
Using the given (deproj )
H ,Z,Td, andavalues for each
bin, we performed a 2-minimizing grid search to nd
the best-t parameters for each galaxy. Because the
model will ultimately plateau at D/H = Zabove a cer-
tain density threshold, where all metals are found in
dust grains, the model cannot incorporate the turnover
in D/H observed for M 31, M 33, and the LMC; we there-
fore only t the model to the points before the turnover
in these cases (below 4 M pc 2for M 31 and M 33, and
below 40 Mpc 2for the LMC). A fuller discussion of
this divergence will be conducted in Section 5; however,
we present the modeling here rst, so that in the follow-
ing sections we can then explore how to potentially rec-
oncile the data with the models. The resulting best-t
parameter values are given in Table A2, with the models
shown on a plot of (deproj )
H versus D/H in Figure 11.
Starting with M 31 and M 33, we can see in Figure 11
that { up until the turnover { the Asano et al. (2013b)
model almost perfectly traces the observed evolution in
D/H with (deproj )
H . For M 31, the model matches the
observed prole across almost an order of magnitude in
both D/H in (deproj )
H , from 0.6{4 M pc 2, and suc-
cessfully replicates the increasing steepness of the D/H
evolution, followed by a leveling-out. Our data do not
probe down to surface densities quite as low as this for
M 33, but otherwise the agreement between model and
data for (deproj )
H<4 Mpc 2is similarly excellent.
For the LMC, the agreement between model and data
in the 2.2{40 M pc 2range, before the D/H turnover,
is not quite as close a match, but nonetheless does
broadly trace the increase in D/H, followed by a leveling-
out.
For the SMC, the model does a similarly mixed job
of tting the data { and the lack of a D/H turnover or
plateau means that our model can be t to the full range
densities. The D/H of the SMC over the 8{50 M pc 2
range is somewhat elevated over what is expected from
the best-tting model. But otherwise, the model ts the
rest of the prole for the SMC reasonably well, capturing22 Clark et al.

the gentle slope at lower densities, and the steepening
at higher densities.
So it would appear that the Asano et al. (2013b) model
does a good job of capturing the broad strokes of evolu-
tion in the D/H. Our data reect the expectation in the
Asano et al. (2013b) framework that grain-growth gets
increasingly ecient as density increases; but only up
until where all metals are locked into dust grains, where
it plateaus. For M 31, M 33, and the LMC in particu-
lar, we nd it to be very reassuring that the levels of
the model plateaus are all close to the levels of the peak
D/H for each galaxy. Because the D/H plateau indicates
when 100% of ISM metals are locked up in dust grains,
the D/H at which it occurs is not free to vary in the
model, but rather happens at a xed level of D/H = Z.
For instance, in the case of the LMC, the plateau hap-
pens at D/H = 0 :5 Z= 0:50:014 = 710 3, which is
very close to the actual highest value of D/H we measure
in the LMC, of 5 :510 3. The agreement is similarly
reasonable for the other galaxies. Given that the val-
ues D/H we measure do not `know' the metallicity of
their galaxy's ISM, and therefore the D/H at which the
model plateau will occur, this agreement suggests that
our measured D/H values are sensible.
Where the data and model diverge radically, however,
is in the apparent turnover in D/H that three of our
galaxies exhibit. That is the focus of the following sec-
tion.
5.THE NATURE OF THE D/H TURNOVER
The most surprising feature in Figure 9 is undoubt-
edly the fact that, for M 31, M 33, and the LMC, D/H
does not plateau as expected from modeling, but rather
turns over and starts to decrease above a certain value
of (deproj )
H .This is extremely surprising. As ISM density in-
creases, the eciency of dust grain growth should also
increase. The greater the density of the ISM, the more
frequently a dust grain will encounter gas phase met-
als, and therefore the more frequently that dust grain
will increase its mass through accretion of those metals,
driving up D/H. Moreover, higher-density ISM will pro-
vide superior shielding from the forces of grain destruc-
tion, such as shocks and high-energy radiation. There-
fore, D/H should continue to increase with density, until
grain-growth starts to saturate as fewer and fewer metals
are left in the gas phase to accrete, ultimately reaching
fd= 1 { hence the plateau predicted by the Asano et al.
(2013b) model.
And there are further reasons to doubt whether this
turnover could actually be present for our target galax-
ies. For instance, at (deproj )
H>150 Mpc 2, it appears
that the D/H prole for the SMC will intersect the pro-
le of the LMC. And it would be extremely surprising
if the SMC were to have a D/H that exceeds that of the
LMC at a given (deproj )
H , given the fact their metallic-
ities dier by a factor of 2.5. Indeed, the peak D/H in
the LMC is2.5 times greater than that in the SMC.
In short, it is hard to conceive of any physical mech-
anism by which D/H could actually fall as density in-
creases. So we examined the question of what could be
causing this to appear to be the case in our data. We
considered 6 possible reasons: Variations in CO; noise-
induced anticorrelation; physical resolution eects; dust
destruction by supernovae and high-energy radiation in
high-density environments due to star formation; the
presence of dark gas, and varying dust mass opacity.
Our full exploration of these possible explanations is
presented in Appendix B. For readers not wishing to
explore this investigation in full, the results are summa-
rized as follows:
We are condent that we can rule out overestimation
ofCO, or elevated dust destruction due to environmen-
tal eects, as causes of the turnover. It also appears that
neither physical resolution limitations nor noise-induced
anti-correlation could be causing the turnover, either.
It seems likely that the presence of dark gas could be
contributing to the appearance of the D/H bump and
turnover for M 31 and M 33, and driving up D/H at the
peak values in the LMC and SMC. However, at the same
time, we are condent that dark gas could notbe causing
signicant bias in the overall D/H evolution prole for
the LMC, nor causing the turnover. This suggests that
dark gas may not the only eect acting in M 31 and
M 33, either.
The possibility that the dust mass absorption coe-
cient,, has a decreasing value at higher densities pro-
vides a viable solution to the apparent turnover, instead
changing the high-density portion of the D/H evolution
prole into a plateau, as we would expect based on dust
evolution modeling. This agrees with the empirical re-The Quest for the Missing Dust: II 23
sult reported in Clark et al. (2019), but conicts with
predictions from physical dust grain models (in which 
is expected to increase with rising density).
Overall, we consider a combination of dark gas and
varyingto be the most likely explanation, but with the
expectation that the contributions of each, and of other
possible factors, is likely varying between environments.
6.THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN FIR TO UV
DUST-TO-GAS RATIOS
A major motivation for this work is the conspicuous
disagreement of D/H measurements for the LMC and
SMC derived from UV absorption line spectroscopy of
elemental depletions, when compared to D/H measure-
ments derived from FIR and radio observations. As
mentioned in Section 1, the FIR D/H estimates pre-
viously reported for the Magellanic Clouds are much
smaller than those determined from depletions. This
disagreement is clear in Figure 12, with the previous FIR
D/H measurements of Roman-Duval et al. (2017) much
lower than the UV D/H measurements found by the
Hubble program Metal Evolution, Transport, and Abun-
dance in the Lmc (METAL; Roman-Duval et al. 2021,
2022b)14. The Roman-Duval et al. (2017) D/H measure-
ments were performed using FIR data from Planck and
IRAS. The disagreement between the D/H determined
using the two methods is striking { being a factor of 2
for the LMC, and a factor of 5 for the SMC.
The lower, FIR-derived value suggests the SMC has
a signicantly depressed D/H relative to its metallic-
ity, and would indicate that the SMC is in the midst of
the critical metallicity transition; the higher UV-derived
value, however, suggests that the SMC has a D/H rea-
sonably in line with the trend seen at higher metallici-
ties, assuming a roughly constant dust-to-metals ratio.
The situation is similar for the LMC; the lower FIR value
would hint that the LMC is just starting to experience
depressed D/H; the higher UV value would instead place
the LMC on the constant dust-to-metals relation.
If the UV-derived D/H values are correct, that would
mean that there are severe shortfalls in the dust masses
determined for local galaxies, with the vast majority of
the dust mass in the SMC being unaccounted for by
previous studies such as Chastenet et al. (2017) and
Roman-Duval et al. (2017). On the other hand, it is
possible that the UV-derived values are overestimates.
While there should be less scope for such signicant
systematic error in the UV measurements, it is conceiv-

from Roman-Duval et al. (2014). These used the older HER-
ITAGE maps of the Magellanic Clouds, and employed the SED
tting results presented by Gordon et al. (2014). As discussed
in Section 3.1.1, the Gordon et al. (2014) dust masses are biased
high, due to the large amount of missing ux in the HERITAGE

late the fractions of hard-to-observe carbon and oxygen
(major dust constituents by mass) depleted into the dust
phase in the Magellanic Clouds, by using the apparently-
invariant relation between the depletion of these ele-
ments, and other more-easily-observed elements, with
increasing H column (Jenkins 2009). It is possible
that this relation becomes unreliable in the Magellanic
Clouds, thereby aecting the fraction of metals in the
dust phase at given densities.
We also note that directly comparing the  Hmea-
surements derived from UV, to those derived from the
21 cm and CO radio data, can be troublesome. The tar-
get stars for the UV sightlines will each be located at a
dierent depth in that galaxy's disc. On average, a given
sightline will sample half of the thickness of the disc; we
could therefore try applying a constant factor of 2 cor-
rection to the  Hof each UV sightline, to attempt to
correct for this. However, the true (unknown) correction
will vary wildly between sightlines. This would place us
in the undesirable situation of applying a `correction',
where the uncertainty on that correction is much larger
than the correction itself. Moreover, each UV sight-
line has the same radius as the target star, and so will
therefore only be sampling a pencil beam of ISM tens of
millions of kilometers across { in contrast to the tens of
parsecs resolution of the 21 cm and CO observations we
use (the eects of this dierence are analyzed in depth
in Section 7 of Roman-Duval et al. 2021). We therefore
opt to only apply our standard deprojection correction
to the surface densities derived from the UV data, and
advise that the reader remains aware that the radio- and
UV-derived  Hvalues cannot be compared in a wholly
`apples-to-apples' manner.
While the use of FIR all-sky survey data by Roman-
Duval et al. (2017) ensures that no diuse emission was
missed (in contrast to the old HERITAGE reductions of
the Magellanic Cloud Herschel data), their use of Planck
and IRAS data may have limited the accuracy of their
results. For instance, they used IRAS data from the
Iras Sky Survey Atlas (ISSA; Wheelock et al. 1994),
which suers from a very non-linear detector response,
that varies as a function of both the surface brightness
and the angular scale of the emission observed (lead-
ing the ISSA explanatory supplement (Wheelock et al.
1994) to suggest 100 m photometric uncertainty of up
to 60%), whereas our new feathered Herschel maps are
pegged to the absolute calibration of the COsmic Back-
ground Explorer (COBE; Boggess et al. 1992). Also,
the peak of the dust temperature distribution lies in
the>0.5 dex gap in wavelength coverage between the
100m IRAS band and the 350 mPlanck band, likely
limiting the accuracy of the Roman-Duval et al. (2017)
SED tting, whereas our data samples this regime with
the 160 and 250 m bands. Plus, unlike us, Roman-
Duval et al. (2017) did not allow for a broken in their24 Clark et al.

measurements of Roman-Duval et al. (2017; wide diamonds), and the UV absorption line measurements of elemental depletions
from the Hubble METAL program Roman-Duval et al. (2022b; narrow diamonds). The small circular points indicate values
from the sample of De Vis et al. (2019; which incorporates and standardized measurements of galaxies from the samples of
R emy-Ruyer et al. 2014; Clark et al. 2015; De Vis et al. 2017b; Davies et al. 2017; Clark et al. 2018), the largest sample to date
exploring this parameter space. The dotted line shows a trend of the D/H /Z (ie, a constant dust-to-metals ratio), passing
through Z=Z, D/H=0.01. The thick gray lines show a selection of dust evolution models from Feldmann (2015), with a
dierent location for each model of the `critical metallicity' at which D/H sharply increases with Z; specically, we plot the
Feldmann (2015) `equilibrium models' where the location of the critical metallicity is set by the ratio of molecular gas depletion
timescale to the interstellar grain growth timescale, with lower ratios leading to higher critical metallicities (see their Figure 3).
SED tting, which may have compromised their results
in areas with signicant submm excess (see Figure 6).
For both the LMC and SMC, the Roman-Duval et al.
(2017) relationships between D/H and (deproj )
H trace
similar slopes to our own, over the range we have in
common. However their trends are oset to much lower
D/H (despite the fact they use the same as we do).
This is presumably due to the improvements in our FIR
data and SED tting.
As a result of the consistently larger D/H values we
nd, there is now much less conict between our FIR
estimates of D/H, and the UV estimates of D/H from
Roman-Duval et al. (2021, 2022b). For the LMC, the
conict has essentially been resolved entirely. Indeed,
as can be seen in Figures 12 and 13, our D/H are now
slightly greater than those determined from the UV. Toevaluate the scale of the remaining dierence, we cal-
culated what oset factor would have to be applied to
our D/H prole to minimize the dierence between it
the UV measurements. For each UV measurement of
D/H, we calculated the D/H implied by our prole at
that same  H(by interpolating between the points in
our prole that bracket the  Hof the UV point), and
found the dierence between them. Having repeated this
for every point, we then used a 2-minimizing routine
to nd what oset factor, applied to our D/H prole,
would minimize the overall dierence between the two
datasets.
For the LMC, we nd that reducing our D/H values
according to a factor of 0.87 would lead to the clos-
est agreement between them and the UV measurements.

Duval et al. (2022b). Error bars on our points are omitted
for clarity, but would be the same as in Figure 9.
Figure 13. Moreover, not only does the absolute D/H
level now match very well, but the slope of our D/H
evolution prole is also an excellent match to that of
the UV data. Given the calibration uncertainties on
both datasets, this 13% disagreement between the UV
and our FIR measurements of D/H is small enough that
we feel condent in saying that the discrepancy can be
deemed resolved in the case of the LMC.
Exceedingly frustratingly, however, the maximum sur-
face density to which the Hubble data of Roman-Duval
et al. (2021, 2022b) could probe D/H corresponds ex-
actly to the location of the D/H turnover. Their UV
data does not probe above this density, and hence can-
not help us ascertain the nature of the turnover. The
Hubble data does not probe to higher densities than this
because extinction increases with  H, and above this
density it becomes impossible to adequately detect the
OB stars used as background sources for this kind of
absorption line spectroscopy. Extending UV absorption
line spectroscopic depletion measures to higher densi-
ties would require a large next-generation UV telescope,
such as the Large UltraViolet Optical InfraRed concept
(LUVIOR; The LUVOIR Team 2019).
The fact that the discrepancy in UV versus FIR mea-
sures of D/H has been resolved for the LMC makes it
all the more interesting, however, that a signicant dis-
crepancy persists in the case of the SMC. As can be seen
in Figure 14, our new data only partially closes the gap
between FIR and UV estimates of D/H in the SMC. Pre-viously, the dierence was a factor of 5, as found by the
Roman-Duval et al. (2017) low-resolution FIR analysis;
with our new data, this has been reduced to a factor of
3 (with this oset calculated in the same manner as for
the LMC, above).
It is not immediately clear why our analysis would re-
solve the FIR `missing dust' problem for the LMC, but
not the SMC. Both use the new Herschel data of Paper I,
reduced and feathered in exactly the same way. The
processing and analysis also proceed identically through-
out. The physical resolution for the SMC is 47 pc, versus
14 pc for the LMC; however, as shown in Section B.3,
even a factor of 10 degradation in physical resolution
causes no systematic shift in the D/H evolution prole;
we would therefore not expect a much smaller change
in resolution to lead to any signicant bias { let alone a
bias as large as this.
As previously discussed, it is known that the dust
properties in the SMC are fundamentally dierent from
those in higher-metallicity galaxies in several ways.
Most sightlines explored in the SMC lack the 2175 A ex-
tinction bump seen in higher-metallicity systems (Gor-
don et al. 2003; Murray et al. 2019); the SMC has
stronger submm excess emission (Bot et al. 2010; Planck
Collaboration et al. 2011c; Gordon et al. 2014); and the
chemical composition of the dust in the SMC is dierent,
too, with iron and carbon being more dominant than at
higher metallicities (Roman-Duval et al. 2022b).
Such large dierence in physical dust properties
should inevitably lead to some change in . A simple
explanation for the persistent D/H oset for the SMC
is that it has a dust mass absorption coecient that
is a factor of 2.5 smaller than that of the LMC { and
therefore also a factor of 2.5 smaller than that of the
Milky Way, as the 160= 1:24 m2kg 1value we use
was itself calibrated using the emission and depletions
of the Galactic cirrus Roman-Duval et al. (2017). Unlike
the SMC, dust in both the LMC and Milky way exhibits
the 2175 A extinction bump (Gordon et al. 2003), which
meshes with the prospect of the SMC dust being dier-
ent from Milky Way and LMC in other ways, too. How-
ever, dust in the SMC is more carbon-rich than the more
silicate-rich dust of the Milky Way (and lesser extent of
the LMC; Roman-Duval et al. 2022b), and carbon dust
should be more emissive than silicate-dominated dust,
not less (Ysard et al. 2018). However, changes in grain
morphology (such as porosity, size, shape, etc), for in-
stance, could counteract the dierences expected from
composition alone.
We do, however, wish to re-state that the link be-
tween actual volume density (the parameter that will
drive grain growth, and hence D/H), and surface den-
sity H(our observable proxy for volume density) po-
tentially have a less direct relationship for the SMC than
for the other galaxies of our sample, due to the complex
elongation structure of the SMC along our line-of-sight26 Clark et al.

(Scowcroft et al. 2016). It is possible that this biases
our measurements of D/H at dierent densities, but the
specics would depend entirely on the nature of three-
dimensional structure of the SMC.
However, even with the remaining discrepancy be-
tween our D/H for the SMC and the UV value, we can
nonetheless rule out a steep drop in D/H at the metal-
licity of the SMC suggested by the older FIR value from
Roman-Duval et al. (2017). This therefore indicates that
the SMC is not in the critical metallicity regime.
A nal note regarding the D/H osets: When compar-
ingglobal D/H, as plotted in Figure 12, the discrepan-
cies between our values, and the UV values of Roman-
Duval et al. (2021, 2022b) are dierent than those in
Figures 13 and 14 (requiring an oset correction of 0.77
for the LMC, and 2.47 for the SMC). This change is due
to the fact that Roman-Duval et al. (2022b) calculated
their global D/H values by taking the relationship be-
tween Hand D/H over the range of densities sampled
by their observations, and extrapolated it to higher and
lower H. They could thereby assign an extrapolated
D/H to the full range of  Hin in LMC and SMC, and
so estimate global D/H. We, on the hand, have mea-
sured D/H over the full range of  Hin the data (and
observe the D/H turnover at densities higher than those
probed by the UV measurements, for example), hence
the dierences in our global D/H values. We consider
the oset calculated from our binned D/H prole to be
the best indicator of the dierence between the two, as
it is calculated over the range of densities for which both
datasets have actual measurements.
6.1. Comparing Local D/H Residuals Between FIR
and UV Measurements
In Roman-Duval et al. (2021), the authors note an
interesting trend in the residuals between the iron de-pletion (a proxy for the fraction of metals locked up
in dust, which directly correlates with D/H at xed
metallicity) determined from each individual UV spec-
tra, and the depletion that would be expected for that
spectra, given that spectra's  H. In general, Roman-
Duval et al. (2021) of course found that sightlines that
sampled higher  Htended to have greater D/H (as in-
ferred from the amount of iron depletion). However,
they also found that in the southeastern portions of
the LMC, sightlines would usually have lower D/H than
would be expected for their  H; conversely, in the north-
western portions of the SMC, sightlines often had higher
D/H than would be expected from their  H. Roman-
Duval et al. (2021) suggest that star-formation triggered
by the gas accretion from the Magellanic Stream onto
the southeast of the LMC could be causing an increased
amount of grain processing and destruction through ra-
diation, shocks, etc.
We were curious whether the same trend was visible
in our data. Using our D/H versus  Hrelation for the
LMC (as in Figure 9), we calculated the D/H we would
expect for each pixel in the LMC, given its  H. We then
found the residual between the measured D/H in each
pixel, and the predicted D/H. We plot a map of these
residuals in Figure 15.
Like Roman-Duval et al. (2021), we nd that D/H
is signicantly depressed in the southeast of the LMC,
relative to what we would expect based on  Halone.
Figure 15 shows that this depression is most conspic-
uous along the edge of the H itail associated with the
gas being accreted from the Magellanic Stream. No-
tably, the most depressed D/H is found furthest along
this tail, to the southern edge of the LMC disc. This
is further from the regions of enhanced star-formation
being trigged by the infall, centered around 30 Doradus.
This suggests that dust processing and destruction due
to the eects of star formation is not the dominant cause
of the lowered D/H in the southeast of the LMC; other-
wise, we would expect D/H to be lower in areas closer to
30 Doradus, and the other areas of heightened star for-
mation. However, grain processing due to gas collision
and the resulting shocks, arising from the infall, could
be the cause. The absence of a metallicity gradient in
the young stars of the LMC argues against a metallicity
eect in general (Roman-Duval et al. 2021); however,
metallicity will likely be depressed at larger radii, along
the tail, where the infalling gas dominates (Nidever et al.
2008; Tsuge et al. 2019, 2020).
The largest positive residuals in Figure 15 seem to
be located along the edges of various large low-density
features in the LMC (compare to Figure 2), which cor-
respond to known supershells (Meaburn 1980), carved
by recent star formation. It is not immediately obvi-
ous why this might be the case. It is conceivable that
the winds from young OB stars and recent supernovae
are able to blow away the less-dense ISM more eas-The Quest for the Missing Dust: II 27

D/H than would be expected given their  H; blue pixels have lower D/H than would be expected. The circles indicate the
UV absorptions spectroscopy sightlines of Roman-Duval et al. (2021); the color with each circle indicates the residual between

ily than the denser ISM where more grain-growth has
occurred, preferentially leaving behind material with a
greater dust content. Similarly, elevated D/H at the
edge of star-forming regions, due to the evacuation of
dust from the centers via wind-driven dust grain drift,
is expected based on the work of Draine (2011).
Figure 15 also shows the positions of the individual
UV sightlines probed by Roman-Duval et al. (2021), and
the residual they found for that sightline. We found the
residual at each of those positions in our data by taking
the mean of the values in our residual map in a 3 3 pixel
square aperture centered on the coordinates of each UV
sightline15. The Roman-Duval et al. (2021) D/H resid-
uals correlate with those we nd at the same positions.
15We used a 3 3 pixel square aperture in order to sample multiple
beams along each axis, and therefore reduce noise, while still
sampling a small enough region to be comparable to the value at
the specic location of the UV sightlineThis is shown explicitly in Figure 16, which plots our
D/H residuals against theirs. While the correlation is
not strong, it would appear to be signicant. Accord-
ing to a Kendall's Tau rank correlation test (Kendall &
Gibbons 1990), the probability of the null hypothesis, of
no correlation, is P(null) = 0:05.
It is not surprising that there is not an especially tight
correlation between the D/H residuals we nd, and those
of Roman-Duval et al. (2021). Their Hubble spectra
sample a pencil beam only as wide as the star being mea-
sured, compared to the 15 pc resolution (and therefore
4545 pc aperture) of our data. Plus, each UV specta's
pencil beam will only sample the ISM on the near side of
the star being used { and dierent stars in their sample
will be located at dierent depths into the LMC disc,
as viewed from Earth. Our data, on the other hand,
sample the thickness of the entire LMC disc. The fact
that our respective residuals do indeed seem to correlate

7.DATA PRODUCTS
Alongside this work, we are releasing the feathered
Herschel maps presented in Paper I. These are provided
as Flexible Image Transport System (FITS; Wells et al.
1981; Hanisch et al. 2001) les, with one FITS le for
each band, for each galaxy. These FITS les contain 4
extensions. Extension 1 ( IMAGE ) provides the standard
feathered map. Extension 2 ( UNC) provides the uncer-
tainty map. Extension 3 ( MASK ) provides a binary mask
map indicating the portion of the data where reliable,
fully-feathered high-resolution coverage is available. Ex-
tension 4 provides the foreground-subtracted version of
the feathered map ( FGND SUB), the header of which also
describes the uncertainty on that subtraction. All maps
are in units of MJy sr 1(except for the binary masks).
Full details of the creation, testing, and properties of
these maps can be found in Paper I.
We also provide data products from the analysis per-
formed in this work. For the SED tting, we providemaps of the median value of each parameter in each pixel
(ie, the maps shown in Figures 5 and 6), and maps of the
uncertainties on those medians (being the 68.3% quan-
tile around the median). This data is provided in FITS
format; each of these FITS les contain 2 extensions.
Extension 1 ( median ) provides the map of pixel param-
eter median values. Extension 2 ( uncert ) provides the
map of uncertainties on those medians. Additionally,
we provide the full posterior probability distribution for
all SED parameters, consisting of 1000 posterior sam-
ples, for all pixels, in the form of a FITS le containing
a 4-dimensional hypercube, with axes corresponding to
right ascension, declination, parameters (in order:  d,
Td,1,2,break, ande500), and samples.
We also provide our maps of  H, and of D/H. Note
that none of the provided maps have had deprojection
corrections applied
Lastly, we provide the Swift -UVOT maps used in Sec-
tion 4.1.2. This data is provided for Swift -UVOT bands
W1, W2, and M2. For each band, we provide a FITS
le containing 3 extensions. Extension 1 ( SURF BRI)
provides the map of the surface brightness in MJy sr 1
(converted using the Swift -UVOT zero points given in
Breeveld et al. 2011). Extension 2 ( RATE ) provides the
map of the count rate (in photons sec 1). Extension 3
(EXP) provides the map of the exposure time (in sec).
The maps for the LMC and SMC are those presented in
Hagen et al. (2017). The maps for M 31 and M 33 are
were reduced following the same process as those in Ha-
gen et al. (2017), and will be fully presented in Decleir
et al. ( in prep. ), but are provided here for the purposes
of reproducibility.

8.CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have explored the relationship be-
tween dust and gas in the Local Group galaxies M 31,
M 33, the LMC, and the SMC, a sample which spans
a wide range in mass, metallicity, and other properties.
Our investigation has taken advantage of new Herschel
maps of these galaxies, presented in Paper I of this se-
ries. Previous Herschel data for these galaxies suered
from severe ltering of extended emission (due to the
Herschel data reduction process; Meixner et al. 2013;
Roussel 2013; Smith et al. 2017, 2021), systematically
biasing that data's ability to detect diuse dust, as well
as compromising the scope for accurate foreground sub-
traction, along with other adverse eects.
The new data from Paper I combined the Herschel
maps, in Fourier space, with data from Planck , IRAS,
and COBE. Those other telescopes, while having res-The Quest for the Missing Dust: II 29
olution a factor of >10 worse than Herschel , did not
lter out the diuse emission. By merging the data, the
Paper I maps preserve the exquisite angular resolution
ofHerschel , while also recovering the previously-missed
diuse dust emission on large scales. By allowing us
to probe the widest possible range of physical scales {
and hence densities { in the ISM of our target galaxies,
the Paper I data has allowed us to investigate how dust
evolves in the ISM.
Previous work has found strong evidence that dust
grains grow in denser regions of the ISM (Fitzpatrick
& Massa 2005; Jenkins 2009; Tchernyshyov et al. 2015;
Roman-Duval et al. 2014, 2017, 2021), but the specics
of how much grain growth happens in dierent environ-
ments, and especially at dierent metallicities, is very
much an open question. In particular, galaxies with
greater metallicities typically have higher D/H; however,
below a certain metallicity, there is evidence that D/H
drops sharply. This `critical metallicity' suggests that
dust grain growth in the ISM only becomes ecient once
metallicity reaches a certain level (Asano et al. 2013a;
Feldmann 2015; Zhukovska et al. 2016). However, the
location and nature of the critical metallicity transition
remains unclear.
We used the new Herschel data from Paper I to per-
form resolved tting of the FIR dust SEDs of our galax-
ies. Comparing the resulting maps of dust mass surface
density, to maps of the hydrogen surface density  H(de-
rived from 21 cm and CO observations), has allowed us
to examine dust-to-gas ratio (which we quantied using
the dust-to-hydrogen ratio, D/H) over an unparalleled
2.5 orders of magnitude in surface density for our sam-
ple of Local Group galaxies, and across the factor 6
variation in metallicity they represent. We have there-
fore been able to study the evolution of the dusty ISM
of galaxies to a far greater level of detail than has been
previously possible.
Our key ndings are:
•The dust-to-gas ratio, D/H, shows very signicant
evolution with gas surface density,  H, for all four
of the galaxies in our sample. We nd that D/H
increases with density by a factor of 22.4 in the
SMC, a factor of 9.0 in M 31, a factor of 3.5 in the
LMC, and a factor of 2.5 in M 33. This is consid-
erably more than found by any previous study of
dust-to-gas variation within galaxies.
•Because M 31 and M 33 have shallow metallicity
gradients16and because the LMC and SMC have
little-to-no metallicity gradient, we can be con-
dent that this evolution in D/H is not simply due
to a metallicity eect.
16The metallicity of M 31 and M 33 falls by only a factor of 3.6 per
R25for M 31, and a factor of 1.65 for M 33 { much less than the
evolution in D/H.•We examine whether greater eciency of dust de-
struction at lower densities could be driving the
evolution in D/H. We consider: dust destruction
by recently-formed stars (from hard radiation, and
from the corresponding core-collapse supernov)
as traced by UV emission; dust destruction due to
ionized gas as traced by H emission; and mod-
els of improved eciency of dust destruction in
lower density ISM. It does not appear that any
of these can account for the observed evolution
of D/H with ISM density. On the contrary, we
are surprised that greater UV luminosity density,
and ionized gas surface density, are correlated with
higher D/H.
•In light of the above, our favored explanation for
the strong evolution in D/H with  His that it
is being driven by increasingly ecient dust grain
growth at higher ISM densities.
•The D/H versus  Hevolution proles of M 31 and
M 33 agree extremely well. The peak D/H for
M 31 of 0.01 is 20% higher than the peak for M 33,
but otherwise they follow each other very closely,
with integrated D/H diering by only 5%. This is
somewhat surprising, as M 31 has 2.6 times higher
metallicity, and 25 times more stellar mass, than
M 33.
•Conversely, the large dierences between the D/H
evolution proles of M 33 and the LMC are very
surprising, given these galaxies' close similarity
in mass, metallicity, and star formation rate.
Nonetheless, the peak D/H of M 33 is 45% greater
than that of the LMC, and occurs at a surface den-
sity a factor of 10 smaller, with the integrated D/H
of M 33 being 82% greater than the LMC's. This
has implications for the common technique (often
applied at high redshift) of estimating a galaxy's
gas mass from its dust emission; while an observer
would likely feel condent in applying the same
conversion factor to two galaxies as apparently-
similar as the LMC and M 33, this would not in
fact be reliable.
•The D/H evolution proles of M 31, and M 33, and
the LMC share a confusing trait, whereby after
steadily increasing with  H, they then turn over
anddecrease at higher densities. There is no phys-
ical reason to expect this; dust evolution modeling
predicts that D/H should plateau at higher densi-
ties, not turn over.
•After extensive investigation, we rule out overes-
timation of CO, elevated dust destruction due
to star formation, physical resolution eects, and
noise-induced anti-correlation, as the cause of the
D/H turnover. We nd that dark gas (atomic30 Clark et al.
and/or molecular) could cause a turnover to ap-
pear for M 31 and M 33 (and articially steepen
the relationship between D/H and density in the
SMC). However, while dark gas is probably elevat-
ing D/H in the LMC at intermediate densities, it
could notbe the driver of the turnover observed for
the LMC. We nd that a fall in the dust mass ab-
sorption coecient ( ) with density to be a plau-
sible explanation for the turnover in the LMC; if
this is the case, we would expect this eect to also
contribute to the turnover in M 33 and M 33.
•Previous FIR-based estimates of D/H in the LMC
and SMC disagreed with those derived from UV
absorption line spectroscopy measurements of ele-
mental depletions. This disagreement was a factor
of 2 for the LMC, and a factor of 5 for the SMC,
implying the existence of previously-missed dust
in these galaxies. Our new D/H estimates resolve
this tension for the LMC, but only reduce it to a
factor of 2.5 disagreement for the SMC. Given the
otherwise close agreement in the D/H evolution
proles between the FIR and UV results, we pro-
pose this suggests that the dust mass absorption
coecient, , is a factor of 3 lower in the SMC
than for the sample's other galaxies, causing its
D/H measurements (and dust mass) to be under-
estimated.

A.D/H EVOLUTION MODEL PARAMETERS
In Section 4.2, we describe how we model the evolution
of D/H with  d, using the model framework of Asano
et al. (2013b). In Table A1, we give the parameter grid
we use to t the model to our data.
For the hydrogen surface-to-volume density con-
version,H)n, we use a grid ranging from 0.05{
5.0 cm 3M 1
pc2. For context, assuming the disc of the
LMC has a thickness of 100 pc (Elmegreen et al. 2001),
and taking from our  Hmaps a mean hydrogen surface
density for the LMC disk of approximately 7 M pc 2,
this implies a mean volume density of 2.8 cm 3, and
henceH)n= 0:4 M 1
pc2. Our 0.05{5.0 cm 3M 1
pc2
grid, spanning over an order of magnitude, is therefore
roughly centered on this value in log space. Our best t
parameters for H)ntend to be a factor of 8{12 greater
than this; we postulate that this may reect the fact that
dust grain-growth along a given sightline is driven not
by the average volume density being sampled, but rather
the areas of greater density in particular. H)nwill be
very dependent upon what fraction of the ISM along a
given sightline is found in the denser molecular phase,
versus the the more vacuous atomic phase. This will be
especially true for a galaxy like the SMC, being highly
elongated along our line-of-sight, such that a given sight-
line could have a very high observed surface density, but
still have little-to-none of that material in environments
of greater volume density. In practical terms, increasing
H)nhas the eect of decreasing the density at which
the D/H plateau is reached.
For the minimum fraction of the metal mass locked up
in dust grains, fd0, we use a grid ranging from 0.0{0.30.
Given that the average value of fdis approximately 0.5
in high-metallicity spiral galaxies (James et al. 2002;
Jenkins 2009; Chiang et al. 2018; Telford et al. 2019),
and given that elemental depletions (and therefore fd)
vary with density by a orders of magnitude (Jenkins
2009; Roman-Duval et al. 2021), it is unlikely that the
very lowest value offdin a galaxy would exceed 0.30.
In practical terms, fd0sets the asymptote in D/H thatTable A2. Best-t parameters for the D/H evolution model,

is reached at low densities. This also has the eect of
dictating the steepness of the relationship between  H
and D/H. This is because the maximum possible D/H is
set by metallicity (being when all metals are in dust), a
lowerfd0requires a steeper evolution of D/H with  H
(the range of densities from which D/H evolves from
its minimum to maximum value is not adjustable by the
free parameter. This appears to be the main reason why
the LMC requires a larger best-t value of fd0than the
other galaxies, as it has a shallower evolutionary trend
between  Hand D/H.
For the average duration of episodes of grain growth,
tgrowth , we use a grid ranging from 1{100 Myr. If grain
growth happens predominantly in molecular clouds,
then this corresponds to the average molecular cloud
lifespan. The average molecular cloud lifespan is
thought to be around 10 Myr, with estimates varying by
a factor of a few (Kruijssen et al. 2015; Meidt et al. 2015;
Chevance et al. 2020). The fact our data show D/H in-
creasing steadily over a wide range of (deproj )
H suggests
that growth isn't just happening in the very densest re-
gions (ie, not only in molecular clouds), and/or that
dust destruction happens to dierent degrees over a wide
range of densities. Observationally, an increased rate of
dust destruction in less-dense environments would mani-
fest in this model framework as a reduction in tgrowth . So
in practice, tgrowth encompasses the typical duration of
episodes of grain growth, weighted by how eciently de-
struction occurs when grains are not undergoing growth.
Ultimately, our best-t values of tgrowth are within a
factor of a few of typical estimates of molecular cloud
lifetimes. In practical terms, tgrowth is degenerate with
H)n, with greater values of tgrowth decreasing the den-
sity at which the D/H plateau is reached. Essentially,
this is due to the fact that more grain growth can occur
when episodes of grain growth last longer, and/or when
the volume density of the ISM is greater.
Despitetgrowth being degenerate with H)n, we opt
to keep both parameters in the model. The primary
reason for this is that both could reasonably be expected
to vary a great deal between between galaxies, and we
don't want to force an entirely unphysical value of eitherThe Quest for the Missing Dust: II 35
paremeter to be adopted. This degeneracy also means
that there are combinations of these parameters, other
than those given in Table A2, which give ts that are
eectively just as good,
The model grid contains just over 1.2 million models.
The best-t parameters we found for each galaxy are
provided in Table A2. We stress again that we do not
suggest that these are the best estimates for the `true'
values of these parameters. But rather, that they are
intended to be reasonable values that yield models that
t the data as well as possible, and indicate the sort of
D/H evolutionary prole we should expect.
B.POSSIBLE CAUSES OF THE D/H TURNOVER
Here we present our in-depth investigation into the
possible causes of the apparent turnover in the D/H at
higher values of  Hfor the LMC, M 31, and M 33, as
presented in Section 5. Specically, we explore 6 possible
explanations for the apparent turnover: Dierences in
CO; noise-induced anticorrelation; physical resolution
eects; dust destruction by star formation; the presence
of dark gas, and varying dust mass opacity.
B.1. Variations in CO?
If we were to have overestimated COfor our galaxies,
then we would be overestimating the amount of molec-
ular gas present, which would mean that we would get
erroneously low D/H values { specically at the higher
densities where molecular gas represents a larger faction
of the total dust budget.
Very suggestively, the surface densities at which
molecular gas starts to dominate over atomic gas in our
(deproj )
H data are 2.1, 3.6, and 35 M pc 2for M 31,
M 33, and the LMC respectively { all very close to
the densities at which their turnovers happen, being
4 Mpc 2for M 31, M 33, and 40 Mpc 2for the
LMC. Meanwhile, for the SMC, which doesn't have a
turnover, there is likewise no surface density at which
the measured molecular gas surface density exceeds that
of the atomic gas34.
We examined to what degree COwould need to be
reduced, in order to get rid of the turnover. To do this,
we repeated our D/H analysis, instead using values of
COthat were modied by factors of 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1,
relative to the ducial values we use for each galaxy
(namely 3.2 K 1km 1s pc 2for M 31 and M 33, 6.4
K 1km 1s pc 2for the LMC, and 21 K 1km 1s pc 2
34While the SMC of course has regions that are molecular-gas dom-
inated, there is no bin of (deproj )
Hin which the mass contribu-
tion of molecular gas exceeds that of atomic gas. This is most
likely due to a combination of our limiting resolution, and the
extreme line-of-sight depth of the SMC. The contribution of a
given molecular-gas-dominated region to the surface density of
a given pixel can be exceeded by the contributions of very long
columns of atomic gas in front of and behind of it, further diluted
by the limits of our spatial resolutionfor the SMC; see Section 7.1 of Paper I for specics on
our choice of COvalues). The resulting D/H evolu-
tionary proles are shown in Figure B1.
The plots in Figure B1 show that reducing COby
over a factor 2{5 is able to mostly remove the turnover
in the case of the LMC. But even a factor of 10 re-
duction inCOcannot remove the turnover for M 31 or
M 33; indeed in the case of M 33, the turnover becomes
more distinct. This may seem counter-intuitive, but the
reasons for it are twofold.
Firstly, reducing COwill increase the D/H measured
for a given pixel, while decreasing the (deproj )
H . This will
have the eect of moving values upwards and leftwards
on Figure B1, therefore tending to cause measurements
to move along the post-turnover portion of a prole, as
opposed to changing the shape of a prole.
Secondly, for the factor 0.2 and 0.1 changes to the du-
cialCO, we are eectively `removing' the vast major-
ity of the molecular gas mass from these galaxies. This
has the eect of making it very hard to accurately dis-
tinguish the relative gas surface densities of pixels. As
an example, consider two pixels, for which the molec-
ular gas content has been calculated using the ducial
CO: an atomic-gas-dominated pixel with  HI= 1:6
and  H2= 0:4; and a molecular-gas-dominated pixel
with  HI= 1:3 and  H2= 3:0. Here, the molecular-
dominated pixel has a considerably larger total mass,
while both pixels have similar atomic gas content, due
to any higher-density gas tending to enter the molecu-
lar phase. Now consider the same pair of pixels when
COis multiplied by 0.1. Now, the originally atomic-
dominated pixel will have  HI= 1:6 and  H2= 0:04,
while the formerly molecular-dominated pixel will have
HI= 1:3 and  H2= 0:3, meaning that the two pixels
would now be measured as having near-identical gas con-
tent. In short, because dierences in atomic gas content
between pixels become relatively smaller at higher densi-
ties, signicantly reducing COmakes high-density pix-
els appear to have similar gas content to one another. As
a result, whereas higher dust densities were previously
very strongly associated with pixels that have higher
gas densities, that relationship is now more mixed. The
worse this mixing gets, the more the trend in D/H vs
(deproj )
H will tend towards a gradient of  1, in a clas-
sic instance of noise-induced anti-correlation35, which is
indeed what we see happening for M 33 in Figure B1.
Given that signicantly reducing COgives rise to this
sort of spurious eect in our data, it would seem that
reducingCOby such larger factors is likely unphysical.
Which should not be a surprising; for instance, reducing
theCOof the LMC by a factor of 5 would make it

bversusb, where there is no intrinsic correlation
betweenaandb, the gradient will tend towards  1 the as noise

only 1.28 K 1km 1s pc 2{ less than half the standard
Milky Way value of 3.2 K 1km 1s pc 2, and much less
than would be expected for a galaxy with less than half
Solar metallicity (Bigiel et al. 2010; Gratier et al. 2010;
Druard et al. 2014). And on top of this, reducing CO
doesn't even manage to get rid of the D/H turnover;
although it is possible that it may minimize the turnover
partially in the case of the LMC, even for less aggressive
reduced values of CO.
As such we are condent that overestimation of CO
is not the cause of the D/H turnover observed for our
galaxies.
B.2. Noise-Induced Anti-Correlation?
As seen in Section B.1, noise-induced anti-correlation
drove negative gradients in D/H evolution when using
very low values of CO. So it is clearly worth check-
ing whether noise-induced anti-correlation could also be
giving rise to the turnover in the rst place. To test
this, we constructed simulated versions of our data, to
explore how noise with dierent behaviors can aect the
trends we observe.
To start with, we created a noiseless toy model in
which D/H evolves from 0.001 at (deproj )
H = 1 Mpc 2,
to 0.01 at (deproj )
H = 10 Mpc 2, at which D/H then
plateaus. This toy model is plotted in Figure B2, and
is intended to be the simplest possible version of the
increase-then-plateau trend in dust evolution we might
expect (Asano et al. 2013b).
First, we assess the impact that generally large scatter
could have when observing this trend. We created simu-
lated data for which 106data points, evenly distributed
in log 10((deproj )
H ), were drawn from the toy model overa 10 2<(deproj )
H<105interval36. We then applied
1 dex of Gaussian noise to the (deproj )
H and dof each
randomly-drawn value, recomputed D/H for these, then
placed them in 0.025 dex bins, as per the real data in Fig-
ure 9, etc. A noise level of 1 dex should do a good job of
probing the eects of signicant scatter on the observed
trend37. The points generated by introducing this scat-
ter are shown as blue squares in Figure B2, and as can
be seen, they still trace the underlying trend. The knee
at (deproj )
H = 10 Mpc 2is no longer as sharp, having
been smoothed out by the scatter, but otherwise there
are no adverse eects present, and certainly no sign of
a spurious D/H turnover.
Next, we perform a test designed to more closely
simulate the scatter present in our actual data, which
tends to steadily decrease for bins at higher densi-
ties38. We proceed as above, but now, instead of be-
ing a constant 1 dex, the scale of the Gaussian scat-
ter on both (deproj )
H and dis a function of (deproj )

falling as density increases. Scatter in dex, , is given
by= 0:5log 10((deproj )
H ) + 1:0, with a oor value
of= 0:1 dex imposed at the highest densities where
would otherwise fall lower than this. The result of
this simulation is shown with the green triangles in Fig-
36This interval is larger than the 100<(deproj )
H<103range
which we plot and discuss. The reason being that if we only
drew values from within the range of interest, then some of the
values would be scattered out of interval when we apply noise,
biasing the binned averages at either end.
37Amongst the bins for our actual data for the sample galaxies,
70% of bins' values have standard deviations of <1 dex, and 92%
have standard deviations of <1.5 dex (all bins for the LMC and
SMC have standard deviations of <1.41 dex).
38Roughly speaking, typical scatter in bins falls from 1.5 dex
at (deproj )
H= 1 Mpc 2, down to 0.2 dex at (deproj )
H=
50 Mpc 2.The Quest for the Missing Dust: II 37

ure B2. Introducing this form of scatter behavior does
not appear to introduce any pathologies into the D/H
evolution prole (other than the knee once again be-
ing smoothed out). This is reassuring, given that this
should roughly emulate the way the scatter evolves with
density in the real data.
Lastly, we test a `plausible worst-case scenario' for
the evolution of scatter with density. For this, we hold
the scale of the Gaussian noise at a constant low level
of 0.05 dex in (deproj )
H and 0.2 dex in  dfor values
up to (deproj )
H = 10 Mpc 2; above this, the noise
grows sharply with  Haccording to a power law, in-
creasing to 0.15 dex in (deproj )
H and 1.2 dex in  dat
(deproj )
H = 1000 Mpc 2. By keeping noise low before
the knee, where D/H is increasing, then making noise
increase considerably after the knee (ie, in the density
regime where we observe the turnover in the real data),
we should be maximizing the potential for noise-induced
anti-correlation, or some other artifact, to create a spu-
rious trend in D/H at higher densities. The binned
medians for this test are shown with pink triangles in
Figure B2. Even with this test, we nd no suspicious
behavior in the resulting D/H evolution prole.
Following these tests, we are aware of no way in which
noise-induced anti-correlation could give rise to an arti-
cial D/H turnover in our data.B.3. Physical Resolution Eects?
The physical resolution our data is able to achieve for
M 31 and M 33 (137 and 147 pc, respectively) is up to
10 times worse that what it can achieve for the LMC
and SMC (15 and 47 pc, respectively). It is therefore
noteworthy that the two galaxies with the much poorer
physical resolution also exhibit the sharper turnovers in
D/H. So it is conceivable that limited physical resolu-
tion could give rise to spurious trends in our results.
In particular, temperature mixing could cause the dust
mass determined from SED tting to be biased low. The
impact of temperature mixing will be expected to in-
crease as physical resolution worsens and as density in-
creases { because a single pixel may then contain not
only the cold, dense dust in giant molecular clouds, but
also warm dust being heated by recent-formed stars, all
blended together. This might cause dust mass to be
underestimated progressively more as density increases,
driving down D/H in a manner resembling our observed
turnover.
To test this possibility, we reprocessed our Herschel
and (deproj )
H data for the LMC and SMC, degrading
the observations so that the Magellanic Clouds appeared
as they would were they at the same distance as M 31
and M 33. Specically, we degraded the data for the
LMC and SMC to produce physical resolution of 142 pc
{ the equivalent of 3600angular resolution at a distance
of 815 kpc. As 815 kpc is the mid-point between the
distances to M 31 and M 33, this maximizes our ability to
compare fairly to both39. If limited physical resolution
is causing spurious trends in our results, then degrading
the physical resolution of the LMC and SMC by a factor
of10 should lead to signicant changes in their D/H
evolution proles.
However, as can be seen in Figure B3 the D/H versus
(deproj )
H the proles followed by the LMC and SMC are
almost completely unchanged by being degraded to the
same physical resolution as M 31 and M 33. The only
signicant dierence is that, as would be expected, the
degraded data cannot trace to surface densities as high
as the full-resolution data40. Otherwise, the degraded
39We felt no need to make any adjustments to the data for M 31
and M 33, given how similar their distances are already. Indeed,
the nearest parts of the disc of M 33 are closer to us than the
furthest parts of the disk of M 31, so degrading the LMC and
SMC data to match the midpoint between the two should allow
for an entirely fair comparison.
40The reason why the LMC and SMC D/H proles still probe to
greater (deproj )
Hthan for M 31 and M 33, despite their data being
degraded to the same eective distance, is because of the larger
deprojection corrections applied to M 31 and M 33, due to their
greater inclination. For instance, were the factor 0.22 correction
not applied to M 31, it would appear to probe up to densities
of 80 Mpc 2, closely matching the highest densities probed by
the LMC and SMC in their degraded data.38 Clark et al.
data simply traces the same D/H evolution prole as
the original data, albeit with somewhat more scatter.
We are in fact pleasantly surprised by how well the
D/H evolution proles for the LMC and SMC have been
preserved. In particular, reducing physical resolution
from 14 pc to 142 pc, in the case of the LMC, will lead
to vastly more temperature mixing, and other merging
of dust populations within each pixel (Galliano et al.
2011). The fact that dust properties can still be recov-
ered well enough to leave the D/H evolution prole ef-
fectively unchanged is a better outcome than we might
have expected. This gives us further condence that
temperature mixing is not signicantly biasing the re-
sults of our SED ts, in addition to the lack of residuals
described in Section 3.1.
The D/H evolution proles for the LMC and SMC
are not at all biased by degrading their data to the ef-
fective distance of M 31 and M 33. This suggests that
the observed proles for M 31 and M 33 are similarly
not signicantly biased versus how they would appear
were they observed at a closer distance to us. We there-
fore conclude that the eects of physical resolution lim-
its are probably not causing the appearance of the D/H
turnover in the case of these two galaxies.
For the LMC, the degraded data is not able to
probe to the highest densities, and only traces up to
60 Mpc 2. We therefore cannot make a strong
statement either way about the possibility of a spuri-
ous turnover being caused by temperature mixing at
densities greater than this. However, we note that of
all four galaxies we consider, the SMC should be the
one vulnerable to the greatest impact from temperature-
mixing. The reason for this is that its extreme elon-
gation along the line-of-sight signicantly increases the
likelihood of dierent dust populations, heated to dier-
ent temperatures by dierent environmental conditions,
being present along a shared column, in a single pixel.
However, instead of displaying a turnover, the SMC in
fact shows the D/H relation getting steeper at the high-
est densities. This remains true even for the degraded
data in Figure B3, where we would expect the impact
of any temperature mixing to be exaggerated, thanks to
each pixel sampling 9 more area. This gives us some
additional reason to think that temperature mixing is
not seriously biasing our D/H values at the highest den-
sities.
B.4. Dust Destruction by Environmental Eects at
Higher Densities?
Various processes can destroy dust grains in the ISM.
Many of these processes arise due to star formation. For
instance, by the supernova shocks following the deaths
of recently-formed massive stars; or by direct photode-
struction of grains by UV and X-ray photons; or by ther-
mal sputtering of grains in the hot ionized gas produced

by young massive stars (Bocchio et al. 2014; Slavin et al.
2015b; Jones et al. 2017; Galliano et al. 2018).
It is therefore conceivable that, in areas of higher-
density ISM where more star formation occurs (Ken-
nicutt 1998), the dust destructive processes associated
with recent star formation lead to D/H being depressed,
manifesting as the turnover we observe. If this is the
case, then for a given (deproj )
H we would expect to nd
lower D/H in areas with more star formation, than in
areas with less star formation at the same (deproj )
H .
To test this, we use the H maps of Gaustad et al.
(2001), which cover both the LMC and SMC at a reso-
lution of 4800; well matched to the resolution of our dust
and gas data. We use these H maps to create maps
of the surface density of ionized gas, (deproj )
H+ , following
the prescription of Paradis et al. (2011). These maps
of ionized gas are an ideal way of tracing where dust
destruction due to star formation is likely to be happen-
ing. Not only is ionized gas a proxy for star formation,
but the ionized gas itself is the environment in which
the resultant dust destruction will occur.
We repeated our analysis of D/H versus (deproj )
H
for the LMC and SMC, splitting the data into 6
bins of ionized gas surface density, from (deproj )
H+ =
10 1:5Mpc 2to (deproj )
H+ = 101:5Mpc 2, with each
bin having a width of 0.5 dex. In Figure B4, the D/H
evolution prole within each of these (deproj )
H+ bins is
plotted, for the LMC and SMC. Note that for these
plots, (deproj )

H+when consid-
ering  Helsewhere in this paper, because in general we do not
expect the ionized gas to be co-local with the cold dense ISM
where grain growth should occur. Therefore including (deproj )
H+
would be expected to weaken our ability to trace evolution in
D/H. Moreover, the D/H evolution prole does not change sig-
nicantly when (deproj )
H+is included { compare the black points
in Figure B4 to the corresponding points in Figure 9does in regions of low (deproj )
H+ . The only exception to
this is for the regions of the very highest ionized gas
surface density, 101:0<H+<101:5Mpc 2, where
in both the LMC and SMC the D/H is conspicuously
elevated above the general trend. This argues strongly
against the hypothesis that the eects of nearby star for-
mation could be depressing D/H. And most importantly
of all, the D/H turnover in the LMC is still present for
all the bins of (deproj )
H+ that trace that range of (deproj )
H
(although the prole for the highest (deproj )
H+ bin does
get noisy at  H>100 Mpc 2).
Moreover, Figure 10 and the corresponding discussion
in Section 4.1.2 also show that more intense UV radia-
tion elds are associated with higher D/H, not lower, in
all four of our sample galaxies.
These observations strongly suggest that dust destruc-
tion due to elevated star formation in regions of (deproj )
H
is not the cause of the D/H turnover.
B.5. Dark Gas?
To measure the gas content of our galaxies, we use
21 cm and CO observations as tracers of the atomic and
molecular gas components. However, if these tracers
miss some fraction of the gas in certain environments,
we would nd incorrect D/H values, thereby introducing
errors into the D/H evolution proles.
In particular, the presence of optically-thick H i(Fukui
et al. 2015; Murray et al. 2018), or CO-dark H 2(Reach
et al. 1994; Grenier et al. 2005; Wolre et al. 2010), could
lead us to under-estimate the amount of gas present
in given environment, and therefore articially inate
D/H. If this were to preferentially happen over a spe-
cic Hregime, then what ought to be a plateau in
D/H could instead incorrectly manifest as a bump. If
such a bump happened at the same surface density
regime where D/H evolution transitioned from growth
to plateau (see Section 4.2), then we would observe a
spurious turnover in D/H.
B.5.1. Dark Gas in the LMC?
First, we consider this possibility for the case of
the LMC. The D/H for the LMC has a peak value
of 0.0056, at (deproj )
H = 40 Mpc 2. Then, as den-
sity increases, D/H falls to an average of 0.0024 for
(deproj )
H10 Mpc 2. If the true value of the D/H
plateau is 0.0024, and the peak to D/H = 0.0056 is be-
ing caused articially by dark gas, this would require
57% of the gas content at densities around 40 M pc 2
to be dark, not traced by 21 cm or CO emission.
In general, CO-dark molecular gas would be expected
to be more prevalent in regions with the lowest molecu-
lar gas densities (Wolre et al. 2010; Glover et al. 2010),
while optically-thick H iis most likely to occur in regions
with higher atomic gas density (Lee et al. 2015). There-
fore the contribution of dark gas is likely to be greatest40 Clark et al.
at intermediate densities, where these two regimes over-
lap { which should broadly correspond to the density
where (deproj )
H transitions from being atomic-gas dom-
inated to molecular-gas dominated.
As already discussed in Section B.1, this atomic{
molecular transition region, at (deproj )
H = 35 Mpc 2
(see also Roman-Duval et al. 2014), well matches the
surface density regime where the D/H turnover starts for
the LMC. At rst glance, this is highly suggestive that
dark gas could be contributing to the apparent turnover
in LMC.
However, dark gas cannot depress D/H measurements,
only raise them. So, given that D/H falls to <310 3
at the highest measured LMC densities of (deproj )
H =
200 Mpc 2, this means that for dark gas to causing
the turnover, all D/H measurements above 3 10 3
would have to be articially inated by dark gas, and
in fact should be no more than 3 10 3. However,
the bins with D/H greater than 3 10 3span a very
wide range of density, 5{200 M pc 2. If we have to as-
sume D/H is in reality no more than 3 10 3over this
entire range, then this would require D/H to be essen-
tially at over 1.6 dex in density { tantamount to saying
that there is essentially no D/H evolution with density
in the LMC. We rule out this possibility, especially be-
cause D/H estimates for the LMC determined via UV
absorption line depletion measurements from Roman-
Duval et al. (2021) agree excellently with our own for
densities of 2 <(deproj )
H<40Mpc 2; they nd a fac-
tor3 increase in D/H over this range, with a peak
D/H of 0.0046, within 18% our own. This lets us be
condent that D/H is not at over this range, and there-
fore the D/H turnover is not predominantly a dark gas
artifact. We perform a detailed comparison with the
Roman-Duval et al. (2021) UV measurements of D/H in
Section 6.
Even if the D/H turnover for the LMC cannot be ex-
plained by dark gas, it is nonetheless worth consider-
ing what other eect dark gas is having upon the LMC
D/H evolution prole. It remains highly suggestive that
D/H peaks at nearly the same (deproj )
H where atomic-
to-molecular transition occurs in the LMC. Moreover,
D/H shows a conspicuous `bump' at densities between
30{60 Mpc 2. This bump occurs at a very simi-
lar range of surface densities as those where the sim-
ulations of Glover & Mac Low (2011) nd CO-dark
gas to be signicant. At average visual extinction of
AV<1 mag, Glover & Mac Low (2011) nd that H 2
makes up a negligible fraction of the total H mass; while
atAV>3 mag, reduced photodissociation means that
eectively all gas-phase carbon is found in CO, causing
the CO-to-H 2conversion stabilize. Given the Glover &
Mac Low (2011) conversion between column density and
AV, being 5:34810 22Z
Zmag cm2, and given that
1 Mpc 2= 1:251020cm 2, the 1< AV<3 magregime where Glover & Mac Low (2011) nd CO-dark
H2to be signicant corresponds to a surface density
range of 30{90 M pc 2{ a close match to the D/H
bump in the LMC. If this is indeed the origin of this
bump feature, it suggests that approximately 30% of
the gas in the 30{60 M pc 2density range is CO-dark.
So far we have not considered dark, optically-thick H i
here. However, the contribution of dark H iwould be
expected to occur below the densities at which H 2starts
to dominate (and be traced by CO). Therefore dark H i
is not a likely explanation for the D/H turnover in the
LMC, and it occurs at densities above those at which
molecular gas begins to dominate.
So, while dark gas cannot be the driver of the high-
density D/H turnover in the LMC, it can make it appear
even more conspicuous, by elevating D/H at these inter-
mediate densities.
B.5.2. Dark Gas in M 31 and M 33?
Next we consider whether dark gas could be causing
a spurious D/H turnover in the case of M 31 and M 33.
Because the striking similarity in how D/H evolves with
(deproj )
H for both galaixes, including the turnover, we
focus this analysis on M 31, as it has more data, over
a wider range of densities { under the expectation that
explanations for our observations of M 31 will also be
valid for M 33.
The peak D/H for M 31 is 0.01, at (deproj )
H =
4 Mpc 2. Then D/H falls to an average of 0.0067 for
(deproj )
H>10 Mpc 2. If the true value of the D/H
plateau is 0.0067, and the peak to D/H = 0.01 is be-
ing caused articially by dark gas, this would require
33% of the gas content at densities around 4 M pc 2
to be dark, not traced by 21 cm or CO emission. This
is fairly plausible. A dark gas fraction of 33% falls well
within the range of estimates proposed by various au-
thors (Grenier et al. 2005; Braun et al. 2009; Abdo et al.
2010; Planck Collaboration et al. 2011d; Paradis et al.
2012). Additionally, the turnover for M 31 happens at
the density where the gas is transitioning from atomic-
to molecular-gas dominated, the regime where dark gas
is most likely to have an eect42.
On the other hand, studies focused on M 31 have sug-
gested that it hosts a very minimal CO-dark molecu-
lar gas component (Smith et al. 2012; Athikkat-Eknath
et al. 2021). Additionally, because dark gas is expected
to be more common in lower-metallicity galaxies (Genzel
et al. 2012; Madden et al. 2020), any dark gas artefact
should be more prominent for the LMC than for M 31 {
42Unfortunately, our poorer spatial resolution for M 31 (and M 33)
means we cannot distinguish the highest density regimes at
(deproj )
H>15 Mpc 2, preventing us from performing the de-
tailed (deproj )
H-to-AVcomparison to the Glover & Mac Low
(2011) CO-dark H 2models that we could test for the LMC.The Quest for the Missing Dust: II 41
whereas in Section B.5.1 above, we have just established
that the inuence of dark gas in the LMC appears most
likely limited to a range of intermediate densities, and
not driving the D/H turnover at higher densities.
As such, we are unable to say with condence whether
dark gas is a major driver of the turnover in M 31 and
M 33, but it seems a plausible explanation.
B.5.3. Dark Gas in the SMC?
Although D/H does not turn over for the SMC, we
nonetheless briey consider what eect dark gas could
be having on our measurements for this system, too.
In particular, we note that the relationship between
D/H and density in the SMC gets abruptly steeper
at (deproj )
H50 Mpc 2. Once again considering
the Glover & Mac Low (2011) simulations of CO-dark
gas in dierent environments, we note that (deproj )
H =
50 Mpc 2corresponds to AV= 0:85 mag, once again
very close to point at which they predict CO-dark H 2
to become signicant. This also matches closely with
the density at which Roman-Duval et al. (2014) nd the
atomic-to-molecular transition begins, at 80 M pc 2.
If the steepening in D/H at >50 Mpc 2in the SMC
is indeed an artifact of CO-dark gas, then it is con-
ceivable that the true evolution of D/H at these higher
densities in fact follows the shallower trend found at
<50 Mpc 2. If this is the case, then that suggests that
>60% of the gas at (deproj )
H>100 Mpc 2is dark. If
the Glover & Mac Low (2011) simulations are correct,
then we would expect the AV>3 mag regime (where
CO reliably traces H 2) to start at 150{200 M pc 2,
above the densities we are able to probe with our spa-
tial resolution. Nonetheless, the eect of dark gas could
even be masking the beginning of a D/H plateau at the
highest densities we can sample.
B.6. Varying Dust Mass Opacity?
The apparent turnover in D/H can be explained if
we are systematically underestimating the dust mass at
higher densities. This could occur if the intrinsic lu-
minosity of the dust changes at dierent densities { ie,
if the mass mass absorption coecient, , varies as a
function of (deproj )
H .
It is essentially guaranteed that varies with density.
We know that the composition of dust varies consider-
ably with density, with dierent elements depleting from
the gas phase onto dust grains at dierent rates in dier-
ent environments (Jenkins 2009; Jenkins & Wallerstein
2017; Roman-Duval et al. 2021, 2022b). Similarly, the
dust grain-size distribution is believed to evolve with
density (Hirashita & Kobayashi 2013; Aoyama et al.
2020), as is the structure of the grains, as they ac-
crete layers and coagulate in dierent phases of the ISM
(Cuppen & Herbst 2007; Jones et al. 2016, 2017; Jones
2018). In light of all of this, it is near-inconceivable that
wouldn't evolve with density to some degree.For our SED tting, we assumed a constant value of
. If, however, were to decrease at higher (deproj )
H ,
then this would lead to us underestimate D/H at those
higher densities, and could cause a plateau in D/H to
instead manifest as a turnover.
Is it plausible that decreases in higher-density ISM?
The exact nature of how evolves with density is mostly
unconstrained at present. However, models consistently
predict that should increase in higher-density ISM,
due to grains developing a `uy' structure as they co-
agulate (Ossenkopf & Henning 1994; Li & Lunine 2003;
Jones 2018). On the other hand, Clark et al. (2019) used
an empirical method to construct resolved maps of 
within nearby spiral galaxies M 74 and M 83, and found
evidence that decreases with increasing  H. Relatedly,
Bianchi et al. (2019) and Bianchi et al. ( subm. ) nd that
higher ISM surface densities and higher molecular-to-
atomic gas ratios are associated with greater dust sur-
face brightness per unit gas surface density (resolved
within 9 nearby spiral galaxies), and with greater dust
luminosity per gas mass (for integrated measurements
of 204 late-type galaxies), also suggesting dust becomes
less emissive at higher ISM densities.
Specically, Clark et al. (2019) found that falls with
Haccording to a power law index of  0:4. Because
M 73 and M 83 were relatively poorly resolved in that
study (590 and 330 pc resolution respectively, compared
to 14{147 pc in this work), and because those galaxies
are highly star-forming (with correspondingly high gas
surface densities) the lowest  Hto which Clark et al.
(2019) could probe in M 74 and M 83 was 3 M pc 2
(with the highest well-sampled  Hbeing 303 Mpc 2).
The much greater distances to M 74 and M 83 (as com-
pared to the Local Group) also make it likely that
temperature mixing will be inuencing the trends ob-
served in those galaxies (Priestley & Whitworth 2020).
Nonetheless, the  Hrange for which Clark et al. (2019)
report a fall in with Hcorresponds to the surface
densities above which we start to see the D/H turnovers
in our target galaxies.
We examined whether a that falls with increas-
ing density, as suggested by Clark et al. (2019), could
explain our apparent D/H turnover. Specically, we
tried a broken model, where remains constant at
160= 1:24 m2kg 1(see Section 3) up until a break
density, after which falls with  Haccording to a 0:4
power law, as per Clark et al. (2019). For the location of
thebreak in each galaxy, we used the surface density
at which D/H peaks:  H= 4 Mpc 2for M 31 and
M 33, and  H= 40 Mpc 2for the LMC. The results
of this are plotted in Figure B5.
In Figure B5, we see that introducing this broken
model does an excellent job of resolving the D/H
turnover for M 31, M 33, and the LMC. In each case, the
D/H evolution prole at higher densities now conforms
well to the plateau we would expect, based on dust evo-42 Clark et al.

lution modeling (see Section 4.2). We therefore think it
is certainly plausible that decreasing in at higher  H
could be the cause of the D/H turnover. It is particularly
interesting that the  0:4 power law rate of decrease of
versus H, as found in Clark et al. (2019), is also the
rate of decrease required to resolve the turnover in our
D/H evolution proles. That said, the fact that physi-
cal dust grain models consistently predict the opposite
behavior { that is expected to increase with density
{ should count against this hypothesis. Nonetheless the
fact that this explanation works so well makes us con-
sider it very plausible43.
Why the  Hat which the D/H turnover happens {
and hence the  Hat whichbreaks { would be an
order of magnitude greater in the LMC than in M 31
and M 33 is unclear, as is the lack of break in the SMC.
We tested changing the break density for the LMC to
H= 4 Mpc 2, to match M 31 and M 33, but this
pushes the D/H plateau for the LMC to a level of
D/H>0.015, even higher than the peak D/H in M 31,
in excess of the metals available in the LMC for form-
ing dust, so this is an unlikely scenario. As discussed
in Section B.1, the dierent turnover surface densities
do correspond to the point at which the ISM transitions
from atomic- to molecular-gas dominated in these galax-
ies, which happens in LMC at a  Hthat is an order of
magnitude higher than in M 31 and M 33. So there are
processes in the ISM of these galaxies happening at the
dierent densities at which their turnovers happen.
Separately, in Section 6, we nd evidence for a con-
stant oset inin the SMC, relative to the LMC.
While separate from any variation in with density,
43Given that the lead author of this work was also lead author of
the Clark et al. (2019) study, they feel it worth mentioning that
they did not enter into this current study with any intention to
search for anti-correlation between and  H, nor did they have
any expectation that they would nd evidence for it. Rather, the
fact that the Clark et al. (2019) result resolves the D/H turnover
found here came as a surprise.this nonetheless further highlights the fact that we re-
ally should not expect to remain constant throughout.
