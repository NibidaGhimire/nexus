Abstract
We discuss a model of the universe where dark energy is replac ed by electrically-
charged extremely-massive dark matter. The cosmological c onstant has a value of
the same order as the mean matter density, consistent with ob servations, and is
obtained classically without ﬁne-tuning.
∗paul.h.frampton@gmail.com1 Introduction
A well-known question in theoretical cosmology concerns the cosmo logical
constant: why does it have the value observed?
This constant, Λ, has the dimensions of a density and observations suggest
that its value is of order
Λ = +O/parenleftbig
(meV)4/parenrightbig
. (1)
It is sometimes stated that this value is surprisingly small, and ingeniou s
explanations have been oﬀered for its alleged smallness. An incomplet e list
[1–5] is brieﬂy discussed at the end of this Letter.
Conventional wisdom is that the energy make-up of the universe is a pprox-
imately 5% normal matter, 25% dark matter and 70% dark energy wh ere
dark energy is responsible for the observed accelerated expansio n.
In the present Letter, we discuss a model in which both of these iss ues are
addressed inanovel way. Thecosmologicalconstant naturallyapp earswitha
value consistent with Eq.(1) without ﬁne-tuning. Our calculations will all be
carriedoutwiththePlanckconstant¯ h. andhencethePlanckmass MPlanck≡/radicalbig
¯hG/c, set equal to zero. In other words, Eq.(1) has no connection at a ll
with quantum mechanics.
How can it be, that Eq.(1) has no connection to the Planck mass? Tha t
sounds crazy! We cannot provide a quick and sharp answer to this q uestion.
Instead, we shall begin by providing a broad-brush discussion of ou r model
which may hint at the answer, and also prepare the reader for some of our
later results which may seem, at ﬁrst sight, to be counterintuitive.
In the model there are four diﬀerent ranges of length scale for ea ch of which
the ruling forces are diﬀerent. At the largest scale (the universe) it is elec-
tromagnetic; at the second scale (clusters, galaxies, planetary s ystems) it
is gravitational; at the third scale (molecules, atoms) it is electromag netic
again; only at the fourth and smallest scale (nucleons, quarks and le ptons)
is electromagnetism joined by strong and weak interactions. Note t hat the
ﬁrst and third scales, dominated by electromagnetism ”sandwich” t he sec-
ond scale, dominated by gravitation. It seems conceivable then tha t, within
this cosmology, careful study of the EM →Gravity←EM matching across
the 1st→2nd←3rd ranges of mass scales could shed light on how to make a
theory of gravity beyond Einstein.
As for the energy make up, in our model it is 5% normal matter and 95 %
dark matter, with 0% dark energy. Dark energy is replaced by a 70% part
1in the 95% dark matter, a part which is composed of electrically-char ged,
extremely-massive primordial black holes.
2 The visible universe
In this section, we establish the mean mass density of our model univ erse.
Its present co-moving radius is 14 Gpc which translates into a volume
VU∼4×1089cm3∼/parenleftbig
5×1091(meV)3/parenrightbig−1(2)
We shall adopt as the mass MUof the model universe
MU≡1023M⊙∼2×1092meV (3)
where we have used the approximation M⊙∼2×1030kg.
The density ρUin the model is therefore
ρU=/parenleftbiggMU
VU/parenrightbigg
∼(√
2meV)4(4)
which, by comparison with Eq.(1), shows that
ρU=O(Λ) (5)
meaningthatthemeanmassdensityofourmodeluniverseiswithinon eorder
of magnitude of the cosmological constant observed in the real un iverse.
We note that the above values of MUandρUare for inclusion only of Old
Dark Matter. Both will be exactly doubled when we add New Dark Matt er,
but the order of magnitude statement in Eq.(5), the only thing actu ally used
in all of our ensuing discussion, will remain valid.
3 Old dark matter
For the dark matter in galaxies and clusters, we assume the dark ma tter
constituents are PIMBHs (IM=Intermediate Mass) with masses in t he range
100M⊙< MPIMBH<105M⊙ (6)
2This assumption could be tested using microlensing of the stars in the Mag-
ellanic Clouds, for which a precursor is the MACHO Collaboration [6]. The y
discovered light curves corresponding to PIMBH masses only up to ∼10M⊙
[7]. Checking the mass range in Eq.(6) cannot be done quickly as the ligh t
curve duration is ∼2 years for MPIMBH= 100M⊙and increases to∼60
years for MPIMBH= 105M⊙.
In our speciﬁc model of Old Dark Matter, we take 1021PIMBHs, each with
mass 100 M⊙.
We include as Old Dark Matter also the supermassive black holes obser ved
in galactic centres. For these we assume a mass range
106M⊙< MPSMBH<1011M⊙ (7)
andfor these, we assume they all areprimordial onthe basis that t here seems
to be insuﬃcient time for stellar-collapse black holes to reach the mas s range
in Eq.(7) by accretion and merging.
In the model we take, for simplicity, PSMBHs all with mass 107M⊙, and one
in each of the 1011galaxies. In other words, the total number nPSMBHof
PSMBHs in the visible universe is nPSMBH= 1011.
4 New dark matter ≡Dark energy
We follow the suggestion made in [8] that there exist a number of PEMB Hs
(EM=Extremely Massive) where
1012M⊙< MPEMBH<1022M⊙ (8)
We shall take for deﬁniteness MPEMBH= 1012M⊙and thus, according to
the semi-empirical rule enunciated in [8], they each carry negative ch arge
QPEMBH≃−4×1032Coulombs. We shall take a number of PEMBHs
nPEMBH= 1011. (9)
Their total mass is therefore Mtotal(PSMBH ) = 1023M⊙.
We are neglecting spin, so each charged black hole is described by a Re issner-
N¨ ordstrom (RN) metric
ds2=f(r)dt2−f(r)−1dr2−r2dθ2−r2sin2θdφ2(10)
3where
f(r)≡/parenleftBig
1−rS
r+rQ
r2/parenrightBig
. (11)
with
rS= 2GM r Q=Q2G (12)
The horizon(s) of the RN metric are where
f(r) = 0 (13)
which gives
r±=1
2/parenleftBig
rS±/radicalBig
r2
S−4r2
Q/parenrightBig
(14)
For 2rQ< rS,Q < M, there are two horizons. When 2 rQ=rS,Q=Mthe
RN black hole is extremal and there is only one horizon.
If 2rQ> rS,Q > M, the RN black hole is super-extremal, there is no horizon
at all and the r= 0 singularity is observable to a distant observer. This is
known as a naked singularity.
All of the PEMBHs are super-extremal RN black holes so our model u niverse
contains precisely a hundred billion naked singularities. We are aware o f the
cosmic censorship hypothesis [9] which would allow only zero naked sing u-
larities but that hypothesis is, to our knowledge, unproven so we be lieve this
is not a fatal ﬂaw.
The suggestion in [8], which the present Letter will support, is that t he
CoulombrepulsionbetweenPEMBHscouldexplaintheobservedaccele rating
expansion of the universe. If so, it must lead to a negative pressur e as one
requirement and we shall show that this actually occurs. More impor tantly,
we shall show that the magnitude of this pressure is consistent with the
observed equation of state associated with the cosmological cons tant.
Given the size of the visible universe discussed in the introduction, it is
straightforward to estimate that the mean separation ¯Lof the PEMBHs is
a few parsecs while their Schwarzschild radius is rS∼0.1 pc, The wide
separation, with rS/¯L∼10−7, implies that an expansion in 1 /ris rapidly
convergent and this fact will simplify our derivation of the pressure .
To derive the pressure we shall need to evaluate the gravitational stress-
energy pseudotensor [10]

µν=−1
8πG(Gµν+Λgµν).
+1
16πG(−g)((−g)(gµνgαβ−gµαgνβ)),αβ(15)
where the ﬁnal subscripts represent simple partial derivatives. W e shall need
also to evaluate the electromagnetic counterpart
T(EM)
µν=FµαgαβFµβ−1
4gµνFαβFαβ. (16)
Let us begin with T(GRAV)
µν. This calculation involves taking up to the second
derivatives of the RN metric in Eq.(10). For the ubiquitous function f(r):
∂
∂rf(r)∼O(1/r2)∂2
∂2rf(r)∼O(1/r4) (17)
∂
∂r(f(r))2∼O(1/r2)∂2
∂2r(f(r))2∼O(1/r4) (18)
∂
∂r(f(r))−1∼O(1/r2)∂2
∂2r(f(r))−1∼O(1/r4) (19)
∂
∂r(f(r))−2∼O(1/r2)∂2
∂2r(f(r))−2∼O(1/r4) (20)
It is not diﬃcult to check, using these derivatives, that the 1st, 3r d and 4th
terms in Eq.(15) all fall oﬀ as O(1/r2) and that only the 2nd term does not.
Turning to T(EM)
µν, and using the fact that the gauge potential for an RN
black hole is
Aµ=/parenleftbiggQ
r,0,0,0/parenrightbigg
(21)
we can straightforwardly see that both terms in Eq.(16) fall oﬀ as O(1/r2).
Collecting results for the two pieces, gravitational and electromag netic, of
the stress-energy tensor we deduce that
T(GRAV)
µν+T(EM)
µν=−/parenleftbiggΛ
8πG/parenrightbigg
gµν+O(1/r2). (22)
The cosmological constant is predicted to be
Λ∼+O/parenleftbig
(meV)4/parenrightbig
. (23)
5which is consistent with its observed value.
Since the stress-energy tensor is proportional to the metric ten sor, and bear-
ing in mind the rapid convergence of the (1 /r) expansion, the equation of
state is predicted to be
ω=P/ρ=−1±O(10−14) (24)
extremely close to the value when the cosmological term in the gener alised
Einstein tensor is proportional to the metric.
Assuming an FLRW metric for the visible universe, and zero curvatur e, the
Friedmann equation is, ignoring radiation,
/parenleftbigg˙a

so that the PEMBHs of the New Dark Matter provide a cosmological c om-
ponent indistinguishable, as far as the expansion properties of the visible
universe are concerned, from what was called dark energy. Hence : New Dark
Matter≡Dark Energy.
5 Entropy
Of the known constituents in the universe the entropy is dominated by the
supermassive black holes, PSMBHs at the galactic centres. In our m odel
there are 1011galaxies each with a 107M⊙supermassive black hole at its
centre. Using the well-known PBH entropy formula [11–13] for black holes
/parenleftbiggS
k/parenrightbigg
BH(ηM⊙)≃1078η2(26)
the PSMBHs are seen to contribute
S/k(PSMBHs )∼10103. (27)
to the entropy of the universe.
The holographic maximum entropy of the universe [14,15] is its surfa ce area
in units of L2
Planck∼10−66cm2, namely
S/k(holog)∼4π(14Gpc)2
L2
Planck∼10123(28)
6so that the PSMBH entropy in Eq.(27) falls far short of this, by abou t twenty
orders of magnitude.
Forthedarkmatteringalaxiesnecessary to explainobserved rota tioncurves,
we include PIMBHs. We take 1011of them each with mass MPIMBH=
100M⊙which leads to
S/k(PIMBHs )∼10103(29)
which, by coincidence, approximately equals the entropy in Eq.(27) f rom
PSMBHs.
A signiﬁcant increase towards the holographic bound arises when we add the
new dark matter, the PEMBHs. If we take 1011PEMBHs each with mass
1012M⊙the entropy is increased by ten orders of magnitude to
S/k(PEMBHs )∼10113. (30)
which, if the aim is to saturate the holographic limit, is a considerable im-
provement.
We are unaware of any compelling argument why the holographic entr opy
bound for the universe should be saturated by its contents, othe r than that
it makes the mathematics, and hence the physical universe, appea r to be
more beautiful. We can achieve saturation by increasing the PEMBH m ass
to 1012+pM⊙and reducing correspondingly the number to nPEMBH= 1011−p
in order to arrive at the revised estimate
S/k(PEMBHs )∼10113+p(31)
so thatp= 10 gives the required additional ten orders of magnitude to
achieve saturation. At ﬁrst sight, a black hole with mass 1022M⊙sounds
ridiculous, but dark matter is so mysterious that we should not leave any
stone unturned.
6 Discussion
Admittedly we have studied only a simpliﬁed model of the visible universe
but it is suﬃciently realistic to take away two lessons: (1) Dark energ y
does not exist as a separate entity. It was a misidentiﬁcation of one part
of dark matter which is composed of electrically-charged extremely -massive
primordial black holes. (2) The observed magnitude of the cosmolog ical
7constant|Λ|∼(meV)4is not surprisingly small but is closely equal to the
meanmassdensityoftheuniverse. Thedistinguishedauthorsin[1–5 ]provide
clever explanations for an alleged smallness. They assume, however , that the
theory of gravity beyond Einstein is based on quantum theories of ﬁ elds or
strings, although we do not yet know this as an established fact.
Our ﬁrst argument for the existence of PEMBHs arose from satur ating the
holographic maximum entropy bound. This would be more compelling if th e
entropy of the universe were shown to be, as we suspect, a truly m eaningful
and useful concept. Regrettably this has not really happened, be cause it
presently lacks a suﬃciently rigorous underlying mathematical basis .
Our second argument favouring PEMBHs is that they can replace th e notion
of dark energy which was a term inserted into the Friedmann equatio n to
parametrise the observed accelerating expansion. Dark energy r equired re-
pulsive gravity which contradicted the fact that gravity is always at tractive.
Itseemsmorenaturaltoascribetheacceleratedexpansion[16,1 7]totheother
long-range force, electromagnetism. The same-sign charges of o ur PEMBHs
canprovide suﬃcient Coulombelectromagnetic repulsion. Aswehave shown,
it can generate a cosmological constant of the correct magnitude and the
observed equation of state with high accuracy.
At ﬁrst sight, our model appeared counterintuitive because at th e largest
length scales it seemed obvious to assume that gravitation dominate s. But
this assumption need not be true in Nature. In our model we actually have
diﬀerent regimes of length scales, and only in the one characterising the
Solar System, galaxies and clusters, does gravity dominate while, at larger,
truly-cosmological scales, electromagnetism takes over from gra vity again.
Based on our model and the precision of the wide-separation expan sion in
1/rwe have predicted that the equation of state associated with the c os-
mological constant to be ω=−1 toO(10−14) accuracy and therefore, since
CMB perturbations are much larger, this deviation from ω=−1 is likely
long to remain unobservable experimentally. If and when there emer ges a
convincing (quantum?)gravity theory beyond Einstein, it could pos sibly give
further corrections to the equation of state. We suspect, howe ver, that such
corrections, if they exist, would be even smaller than the error aris ing from
the wide-separation approximation.
