Abstract
In response to a recent criticism, appeared in Ref. [ 5], we argue that the standard scenario to form primordial black
holes in the early universe based on a phase of ultra-slow-roll in single -ﬁeld inﬂation is not ruled out.

I. INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSION
A standard mechanism to create Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in the early universe is by enhancing the short scale
curvature perturbation ζS[1–3] during an Ultra Slow Roll (USR) period when the inﬂaton potential V(φ) is quite ﬂat.
If loop corrections from the short modes are larger than the tree -level contribution to the large-scale power spectrum
Pζ(kL), the USR mechanism to generate PBHs will be inevitably ruled out, as advocated in Ref. [ 4], and more recently
in Ref. [5]. In a short note, we have argued that the PBH Formation from sing le-ﬁeld inﬂation is in fact not ruled out
[6]. The argument was as follows. Short modes propagate in a universe perturbed by the presence of a long, basically
static, CMB mode which can be absorbed by a short momentum resca ling. The loop correction is therefore dictated
by the correlation between the short mode expectation value and t he long wavelength mode or, in other words, by the
corresponding squeezed bispectrum

Loop corrections are therefore suppressed by the breaking of s cale invariance in the short mode power spectrum or, in
other words, by ﬁeld derivatives of the inﬂaton potential. In Ref. [ 5] this point has been questioned based on the fact
that a non-suppressed (by slow-roll parameters) squeezed bisp ectrum (corresponding to a non-linear non-Gaussianity
parameter fNL= 5/2) is present once one recall that the cubic interaction

is obtained after the ﬁeld redeﬁnition ζ→ζ+ηζ2/4+ζζ′necessary to remove a boundary term [ 7].
However, in Ref. [ 6] (see end of Section III) it was explicitly stated that this is not nece ssarily true when taking
into account the details of the transition into the slow-roll phase fo llowing the USR period. Let us elaborate about
this point further here. If the transition is not sudden, the non-G aussianity evolves to become suppressed by slow-roll
parameters and the argument of Ref. [ 6] applies. To show this explicitly, we follow Ref. [ 8] and write the interaction
term (I.2) in the form

Suppose that the transition is not sudden, in the sense that the slo w-roll parameter ǫVduring the slow-roll phase
might be smaller compared to the inﬂaton velocity at the end of the US R phase. This can be achieved for instance
in the Starobinsky spiky model [ 9] where there is an abrupt change in the slop of the linear potential o f the inﬂaton
ﬁeldφ. Even if one is subjects to drastic variations of the ηparameter during the USR phase, inserting the analytical
solutions for ǫandηone ﬁnds [ 8]

Therefore, the contribution from this term is always tiny, no matte r how large is ηand ˙ηare during the transition, and
in fact suppressed by slow-roll parameters. Indeed, the corres ponding squeezed bispectrum /angbracketleft/angbracketleftζSζS/angbracketrightζLζL/angbracketrightis suppressed

VηV) [8], withǫVsmall enough to generate PBHs. In other words, if the curvature perturbations keep evolving
during the transition from the USR phase into the slow-roll phase (t his happens in realistic cases of smooth transitions
or some sharp transition scenarios), the large local non-Gaussian ity generated in the USR phase is erased by the
subsequent evolution and the argument of Ref. [ 6] applies.
As a closing note, let us also add an important point that in the discuss ion has never been touched upon. Much
ambiguity in the literature has been present regarding which pertur bations one should use to compute the PBH
abundance. However, it is rather clear by now that the most corre ct correct quantity is the smoothed density contrast
[10]

wherermis the point where the compaction function has its maximum, rather t han the metric perturbation ζ.
Indeed, on superhorizon scales one can always shift the comoving c urvature perturbation by an arbitrary constant by
a coordinate transformation. This makes the calculation of the PBH unphysical. This problem is avoided by using δm
which depends on spatial derivatives of the curvature perturbat ion.
The point is now that the PBH abundance calculated through the cor rect variable δmrequires much smaller values
of the short scale power spectrum amplitude Pζ(kS) than if the same PBH abundance is calculated using the comoving
curvature perturbation. For instance, for the value adopted in R ef. [5]Pζ(kS) =O(10−1), the same abundance of
PBHs, when calculated with the correct variable δm, requires Pζ(kS) =O(10−3) [11], which reduces considerably the
loop correction to the large scale CMB spectrum even in the case of s udden transition.
We conclude that the one may not claim that the PBH formation scena rio from single-ﬁeld inﬂation is ruled out in
full generality as the ﬁne details of the transition from the USR phas e into the standard slow-roll one matter, as well
as the adoption of the correct variable to calculate the PBH abunda nce.
