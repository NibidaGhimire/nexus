Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks are widely thought of as 
being analogous to inorganic AB 2 phases. We test the va-
lidity of this assumption by comparing simplified and fully atomistic machine- learning models for local environ-
ments in ZIFs. Our work addresses the central question to 
what extent chemical information can be “coarse -
grained” in hybrid framework materials.  
Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) materials
1–4 have gar-
nered interest because of their fundamental properties5,6 
as well as emerging applica tions.7,8 ZIFs are a class of 
metal– organic frameworks (MOFs) with zeolite -like archi-
tectures, showing characteristic properties of both groups. Like inorganic zeolites, ZIFs are chemically and thermally 
stable whilst having markedly higher surface areas and 
pore volumes. Beyond the crystalline state, ZIFs have been synthesised and characterised in various glassy
9–12 and liq-
uid forms;13 for a recent review, see Ref. 14. 
ZIFs are built up of cationic metal centres and anionic linker 
molecules. Based on topology and geometry, as well as for-
mal charges (2+/1– on the cations/anions, respectively), 
ZIFs have long been thought of as tetrahedral AB 2 networks 
analogous to SiO 2 (4+/2 –; Fig. 1a).1 Consequently, the con-
ceptual mapping to zeolites has informed the synth esis and 
understanding of ZIFs.15,16 However, the extent to which 
this analogy holds quantitatively  remains an open question 
– it is yet unclear whether the energetic landscape of ZIFs 
can be quantified without a fully atomistic description, and 
whether th e established stability trends in zeolites17 map 
onto hybrid ZIF phases, especially given that both materials 
classes access different crystal topologies.  
Describing ZIFs as AB 2 networks, as illustrated in Fig. 1b, is 
an example of structural coarse -graini ng (cg): a group of at-
oms or an entire molecule is represented by a single 
pseudo -atom (“bead”). This approach is popular in compu-
tational chemistry, as lowering the structural resolution en-
ables faster simulations; for example, cg dynamics are now 
abundantly used in biomolecular modelling.18,19 Conceptu-
ally similar cg approaches can help to rationalise interac-tions in complex disordered networks, as we have recently shown for amorphous calcium carbonate.

matic of the coarse -graining approach, visualised using VESTA.21  
In the present work, we test how well ZIFs can be described as coarse -grained AB
2 networks from the viewpoint of 
chemical machine learning (ML). We create ML models fo r 
the energies of local environments in ZIFs and compare the 
accuracy that can be reached with cg versus  fully atomistic 
representations. We have previously shown that cg -ML 
models enable unsupervised learning in this domain, by vis-
ualising structural rela tionships between ZIFs and inorganic 
AB 2 networks.22,23 Our present work now shows that ener-
getics in ZIFs can be described, to useful accuracy, by su-
pervised cg -ML models. Our study complements wider-
ranging activities on cg force -field development,24–30 and at 
the same time it addresses general questions about the na-
ture of hybrid framework materials.  
To create the input data for this study, we took a large set 
of AB 2-connected networks – which included the experi-
mental ZIF top ologies – from Ref. 23. We decorated them 
with Zn2+ cations and Im– linkers throughout, generated 
copies of the resulting structures with random distortions, and then evaluated their energies with an empirical force -
field model from Ref. 31.‡ In addition t o per -cell ( total ) en-
ergies, this model by construction yields local energies for 
each atom – allowing us to build a large “synthetic” dataset 
with which the properties of ML models can be studied, fol-
lowing ideas in Refs. 32 and 33.

description; a cg description where the linker molecules are described by single “B” beads (Fig. 1b); and a more aggressively  coarse -grained 
model where on ly A-site species are represented. ( c) Learning curves showing the model root mean square error (RMSE) depending on the

We focus on machine -learning the energetic stability of the 
Zn2+ cations in ZIFs within the present work. We assume 
that the energetics of Zn2+ sites are described by the atomic 
energies of the cations themselves, 𝜀𝜀Zn(𝑖𝑖), and those of their 
immediate surround ings. Specifically, we assign the energy 
of any Im– linker to each of its two Zn2+ neighbours in equal 
parts – just like in SiO 2, an O atom that connects two cor-
ner-sharing tetrahedra would be attributed half-and- half to 
both. We obtain the energy of the j-th linker, 𝜀𝜀Im(𝑗𝑗), by sum-
ming over the local energies of all C, N, and H atoms in this 
particular molecule, and hence,  
𝜀𝜀local(𝑖𝑖)=𝜀𝜀Zn(𝑖𝑖)+1
2�𝜀𝜀Im(𝑗𝑗)4
𝑗𝑗=1 
yields the local -en vironment energy of the i- th Zn2+ cation 
in a given ZIF structure, which is our learning target. We 
note that using the above definition, summing up 𝜀𝜀local(𝑖𝑖) 
over the unit cell conveniently yields the energy of the en-
tire structure, and that the decomposition into local contri-
butions is analogous to a key assumption in ML interatomic 
poten tial development.35,36 We reference the energy val-
ues to crystalline ZIF -zni, which is the thermodynamically 
stable form at ambient conditions.37 
To create atomistic and cg models, we use Gaussian pro-cess regression (GPR),
34 an established and data -efficie nt 
ML approach. We use the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Posi-tions (SOAP) technique
38 to construct descriptor (feature) 
vectors, 𝐱𝐱1 to 𝐱𝐱𝑁𝑁, representing the Zn2+ environments, and 
from those we build the kernel matrix, 𝐊𝐊𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁, measuring the 
similarity of environments with one another. The “ground -
truth” labels, 𝑦𝑦1 to 𝑦𝑦𝑁𝑁, as defined above, are collected in a vector, 𝐲𝐲, and hence the coefficients, 𝐜𝐜 , are obtain ed by 
solving  
𝐜𝐜=[𝐊𝐊𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁+𝚺𝚺]−1 𝐲𝐲  
(Fig. 2a). In this, 𝚺𝚺  adds a regularisation term, correspond-
ing to expected “noise” in the input, here applied as a con-stant value for all atoms. Predictions for a new Zn
2+ envi-
ronment, 𝑦𝑦 �(𝐱𝐱), are made by computing the SOAP  similar-
ity, 𝑘𝑘, between 𝐱𝐱 and every training point, and then evalu-
ating 𝑦𝑦 �(𝐱𝐱)=𝐜𝐜T𝐤𝐤.‡ 
We show results for the regression of the local -environ-
ment energies in our ZIF dataset in Fig. 2b. The panels in this figure allow us to assess the quality of the GPR M L 
models compared to the ground- truth (training) data: the 
scatter plots show how far each prediction deviates from 
the identity, and therefore how large the numerical error 
is. The plots show cross- validation results, so that the test-
ing data are not included when training any one specific 
model.  
Moving from the left- to the right -hand side of Fig. 2b al-
lows us to directly compare and contrast a fully atomistic 
GPR model and the corresponding cg- GPR fits. Even though 
we have mad e the structural representation notably sim-
pler, there is only modest loss in accuracy in an AB
2-based 
cg model that includes the locations of the Im– linkers. In 
contrast, a purely A-site -based cg model (that represents 
the ZIF structures by considering only the cation sites and ignoring the location of the linkers) leads to a much poorer 
prediction of the local -environment energies, because too 
much structural information has been lost.

Fig. 3. Survey of the hyperparameter space for fully atomistic versus cg- GPR models. The two decisive choices are the cut -off radius (vertical 
axis) and the smoothness of the atomic neighbour density (horizontal axis). The results of a grid search are given by co lour-coding, with individual 
grid points highlighted by small white markers, and the location of the respective minimum indicated by an asterisk. For those scans, we used a 
more economical setting of N  = 20,000 training points, compared to N = 32,000 other wise .

The learning curves in Fig. 2c, showing the evolution of the 
error with increasing number of training datapoints, sug-
gest that the ML model predictions are close to converged 
with regard to the amount of training data used in the fit, 
particularly in the cg cases. For the fully atomistic GPR 
model, the quality of prediction is about 40 meV per for-
mula unit, or ≈ 1 kcal mol–1. The accuracy decreases by a 
factor of 1.5 compared to the fully atomistic models if the 
Im– units are coarse- grained, but by a factor of more than 
3 if they are omitted entirely. 
With an initial proof -of-concept in hand, we probed the ML 
models in more detail by investigating how they depend on 
the hyperparameters used in the fit. The most important 
ones control the behaviour of the SOAP descriptor: the cut -
off radius, 𝑟𝑟cut, and t he smoothness of the atomic neigh-
bour density, 𝜎𝜎at. The former determines the locality of in-
formation that the descriptor incorporates for a given en-
vironment; the latter affects the ability of the model to gen-
eralise to new structures by gradually reducing the preci-
sion of the information about atomic sites. Whilst the re-
sults in Fig. 2 have been obtained with optimised hyperpa-
rameters for each model type, Fig. 3 now shows the results 
of a grid search that more systematically explores the ef-
fect of both h yperparameters on the model error. We sam-
pled values of 𝑟𝑟cut and 𝜎𝜎at up to 15 Å and 2 Å, respectively, 
and thus a much wider range than used in typical SOAP -
based ML interatomic potentials ( 𝑟𝑟cut≈ 5 Å and 𝜎𝜎 at≈ 0.5 
Å; Ref. 34). In each panel of Fig. 3, the respective “best” setting (leading to the lowest numerical error) is indicated 
by an asterisk.  
The loss landscape, i.e. , the variation of errors with hy-
perparameter settings, is quite shallow around the minima, 
especially in the 𝑟𝑟cut dimension. Hence, a small change in 
𝑟𝑟cut has little impact on the performance of the model, par-
ticularly for the cg ones. The fully atomistic GPR model is optimised by a lower 𝑟𝑟
cut value than its cg counterparts: at 
a fixed cut -off, the atomistic representation contains m ore 
information about the local environment, presumably re-
ducing the number of neighbours (within 𝑟𝑟cut) that need to 
be included. Similarly, a higher 𝜎𝜎 at is beneficial for the cg 
models. We cross- checked how using the optimised hy-
perparameters for one representation affects the predic-tion error of another (Table 1); the effect is notable for fully atomistic models, much less so for the cg ones.  
Comparing the three plots in Fig. 3 side -by-side, it becomes 
apparent once more how the quality of the models d e-
pends on the degree of structural coarse -graining. Reduc-
ing the Im
– linkers to single beads leads to models with rea-
sonable errors (Fig. 3b) – whilst leaving them out entirely is 
clearly unfavourable (Fig. 3c). We also checked the RMSEs 
for predicting onl y the Zn2+ energies, 𝜀𝜀Zn(𝑖𝑖), without taking 
the energy contributions of the linkers into account; those 
errors are 0.010, 0.020, and 0.081 eV for the fully atomistic, 
AB 2-, and A -only cg models, respectively, consistent with 
the trends observed for 𝜀𝜀local(𝑖𝑖) (Fig. 2c; Table 1). Future work 
on ML models for ZIFs might therefore involve fully atom-istic and AB
2-like cg representations, with the latter reduc-
ing the number of coordinates to be considered from 51 
per Zn(Im) 2 unit to only 9 per AB 2 equivalent.  
In conclusion, our work has shown that local- environment 
energies in ZIFs can be “machine -learned” using cg struc-
tural representations, with less than a factor of 2 loss of ac-
curacy compared to established, fully atomistic ap-
proaches. In doing  so, we showed that local energies from 
an empirical force field for ZIFs31 can be readily available 
“synthetic” regression targets – extending prior work in the 
field of atomistic ML32,33 to the construction of cg models. 
4 
 Chemically, our results provide d irect and quantitative sup-
port for the long -standing idea that there exists a mapping 
between ZIFs and zeolites (Fig. 1a) based on their underly-
ing tetrahedral connectivity.  
What next? A direct avenue for future work is to move from 
the unsubstituted imida zolate to a wider range of increas-
ingly anisotropic linkers (methyl- , ethyl -, benzimidazolate, 
etc.), and from there onwards to the more general class of 
AB 2 MOFs. In the present proof -of-concept, we focused on 
the regression of easily available synthetic energies for lo-cal Zn
2+ environments, but we note that GPR and related 
techniques could similarly be applied to “learning” other atomistic properties, such as NMR chemical shifts.
39–41 Hav-
ing fast and accurate ML models for predicting the latter could assist in interpreting NMR studies particularly of 
glassy ZIFs.
42,43 Finally, a clear direction for future research 
will be the extension from local -energy models to the pre-
diction of forces on atoms, and to the development of cg -
ML force fields enabling accurate large -scale simulations 
for the growing material class of ZIFs.
