Abstract The analysis of light variation of M87 can help us understand the disc evolution.
In the past decade, M87 has experienced several short-term l ight variabilities related to ﬂares.
We also ﬁnd there are year-scale X-ray variations in the core of M87. Their light variability
properties are similar to clumpy-ADAF. By re-analyzing 56 Chandra observations from 2007
to 2019, we distinguish the ‘non-ﬂaring state’ from ‘ﬂaring state’ in the light variability. After
removing ﬂaring state data, we identify 4 gas clumps in the nu cleus and all of them can be well
ﬁtted by the clumpy-ADAF model. The average mass accretion r ate is∼0.16M⊙yr−1. We
analyze the photon index( Γ) — ﬂux(2-10keV) correlation between the non-ﬂaring state a nd
ﬂaring state. For the non-ﬂaring states, the ﬂux is inversel y proportional to the photon index.
For the ﬂaring states, we ﬁnd no obvious correlation between the two parameters. In addition,
we ﬁnd that the ﬂare always occurs at a high mass accretion rat e, and after the luminosity of
the ﬂare reaches the peak, it will be accompanied by a sudden d ecrease in luminosity. Our
results can be explained as that the energy released by magne tic reconnection destroys the
structure of the accretion disc, thus the luminosity decrea ses rapidly and returns to normal
levels thereafter.

1 INTRODUCTION
M87(NGC4486) is a large radio galaxy located in the Virgo Clu ster (Macchetto et al. 1997) at a distance of
18.5 Mpc from us (Blakeslee et al. 2001). Its central “engine ” is a super-massive black hole (SMBH) with a
⋆This paper is dedicated to the memory of my wonderful tutor Fe i Xiang, who recently passed away.2 Y .-L. Cheng et al.
mass of about 6.5×109M⊙(Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019). M87 em its a high-energy
plasma jet extending about 5000 light-years from the core, a nd its relativistic jet is misaligned by an angle
of∼30◦with respect to our line of sight (Bicknell & Begelman 1996). The jet components of M87 can be
resolved in radio, optical/UV and X-ray bands. Considering its large inclination, it is an ideal case to study
the accretion disc of black hole and the details near the jet.
The radiation mechanism of M87 has been discussed by many res earchers. Wilson & Yang (2002)
assumed that the X-ray radiation came from the standard thin disc. With a canonical radiation ef-
ﬁciency∼0.1(Di Matteo et al. 2000), the predicted nuclear luminosity of M87 should be ∼5×
1044erg s−1(Di Matteo et al. 2003). However, the luminosity observed by Chandra is∼7×1040ergs−1
(Di Matteo et al. 2003). It means that the actual radiation ef ﬁciency is ∼10−5, four orders magnitude lower
than the canonical value, and the required value of radiatio n efﬁciency was consistent with the prediction
of the Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF, Narayan & Y i 1995) models . Di Matteo et al. (2003)
ﬁtted the X-ray spectra of M87 with ADAF models and veriﬁed th at its X-ray radiation was dominated by
ADAF.
As a Low Luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs, Yuan & Narayan 2014), M87 do es not have strong ﬂux like
blazars. However, from the past observations, it was found t hat M87 has experienced several short-term
light variabilities. In 2005, H.E.S.S captured a TeV emissi on of M87 with timescales of a few days
(Aharonian et al. 2006). The joint observation of Chandra found a giant ﬂare (Harris et al. 2006) accompa-
nied by this TeV event in knot HST-1 ( 0.86′′away from the core). Therefore, Cheung et al. (2007) propose d
HST-1 as a candidate for TeV emission. However, another TeV ﬂ are was observed by H.E.S.S., MAGIC
(Albert et al. 2008) and VERITAS (Acciari et al. 2008) in 2008 which lasted for about two weeks. In the
following days, Chandra observations suggested that the X-ray intensity of the nucl eus was 2 to 3 times
higher than usual (Harris et al. 2009). Different to the ﬁrst outburst, HST-1 was in a low state at this time
and its X-ray ﬂux was lower than that in the nucleus. In 2010, a third VHE γ-ray burst was captured and the
time-scale of intensity-doubling was day-scale (Aliu et al . 2012). After the TeV emission, X-ray intensity
in the nucleus was also enhanced. Therefore, it can be conﬁrm ed that the site of the TeV ﬂare is the nucleus
rather than HST-1 (Harris et al. 2011). It is still unclear wh ere the X-ray ﬂare originates. Similar to the solar
ﬂare, the X-ray ﬂares of M87 may be triggered by magnetic reco nnection (Aschwanden 2011; Yuan et al.
2009; Yang et al. 2019) or from the mini-jet (Giannios et al. 2 009). For the intraday variability of the M87
core in 2017, Imazawa et al. (2021) suggested that the emissi on might come from the inverse Compton
scattering in the jet.
Previous studies mainly focused on these striking ﬂare even ts in day-scale or month-scale, but the re-
search on the year-scale light variability of M87 was rare. F or LLAGNs, the emission of year-scale variation
is considered to be related to the accretion mode of the disc. Wang et al. (2012) proposed that the inhomoge-
neous accretion ﬂow in LLAGNs might be clumpy (i.e., clumpy- ADAF), which originated from the thermal
instability in the accretion ﬂow or is affected by gravity. O nce the clump is formed, it will fall toward the
centre of the black hole under the tidal force and bring about a long-term light variation. By re-analyzing
Chandra observations from 2007 to 2008, Xiang & Cheng (2020) found a y ear-scale X-ray variation in the
core of M87, and successfully ﬁtted the spectra with a simple clumpy accretion model.The year-scale X-ray variations of M87 3
To validate the clumpy-ADAF model, we check the M87 observat ions of Chandra from 2007 to 2019
and obtain the long-term X-ray variation of M87. We distingu ish the ‘non-ﬂaring state’ from ‘ﬂaring state’ in
the light curve with a universal classiﬁcation method. Base d on the work of Xiang & Cheng (2020), we ﬁnd
another three year-scale variability components and repro duce them with a clumpy accretion model. This
paper is developed as follows: the Chandra data analysis is described in Section 2, the clumpy accretio n
model ﬁtting results are presented in Section 3, we discuss t he physical characteristics of the clump in
Section 4 and ﬁnally, conclusions are listed in Section 5. Th e distance rof M87 used in this study is 18.5
Mpc.
2 DATA AND ANALYSIS
To study the long-term X-ray variation of M87, we select the d ata of M87 observed by Chandra X-Ray
Observatory with subarcsecond resolution. From July 31th, 2007 to March 28th, 2019, 56 observations are
carried out using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (AC IS) and back-illuminated S3 detector. The
time period of each observation is about 4.7ks and the observ ation mode is FAINT. A 0.4 sec frame time is
set to minimize the signiﬁcant pileup effect (Harris et al. 2 006). We use CIAO (version 4.13) to analyse the
Chandra data retrieved from the archive. First of all, we reprocess t he data by the chandra repro script
to ensure that the latest calibrations is consistent with th e current version of CIAO.
As the core is very close to HST-1, only 0.86′′, sometimes the two regions cannot be well distinguished.
When HST-1 is bright, possible “light pollution” from HST-1 might happen in the nucleus region, especially
for the outburst event of HST-1 in 2005 (Harris et al. 2009; Ha rris et al. 2011). Xiang & Cheng (2020)’
analysis showed the nucleus region is little inﬂuenced by HS T-1 from 2007 to 2008. In 2008, the nucleus
was brighter than HST-1, and then the luminosity of HST-1 con tinued to decrease. Therefore, the “light
pollution” of HST-1 on the nucleus can be ignored in our analy sis, but we are still careful for border of the
core region which might inﬂuence the result of our spectra an alysis. We adopt a box region with a size of
0.8′′×2.6′′including nucleus (Yang et al. 2019). Since the core is spher ical, we take the brightest center of
the core as the center of the box region (shown in the top panel of Fig. 1).
The surface of ACIS has accumulated a layer of contamination over the mission (Plucinsky et al. 2018).
Since our data spans 12 years, we check the stability of the in strument during this long-term observations.
We take a rectangle region with a size of 17′′×8.5′′without resolved point sources as the background
region, whose center is located at R.A.= 12h30m49.25s, Dec=12◦23′19.10′′(J2000) (shown in the top panel
of Fig. 1). The photon count rate of the background region of a ll observations between 2.0-10.0 keV are
nearly stable as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. Their ave rage value is about 0.023 ±0.002ctss−1(the
red line in the bottom panel of Fig. 1). Thus we omit the instru ment contamination at hard X-ray band of
2.0-10.0 keV .

3.2 Clumpy Accretion Model Fitting
It can be clearly seen from the M87 black hole image published by the Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT) in 2017 that the bright ring morphology appe ars to be inhomogeneous
(EHT MWL Science Working Group et al. 2021). Meanwhile, the y ear-scale variaton of M87 is a long-term
evolution process, and the light variability characterist ics are similar to the clumpy-ADAF model proposed
by Wang et al. (2012). The accretion rates can be written in Ed dington units, ˙M= ˙m˙MEdd, where˙MEdd
is the Eddington accretion rates which can be deﬁned as: ˙MEdd=LEdd/ηc2= 2.2×10−8mM⊙yr−1
(Di Matteo et al. 2003), m=MBH/M⊙is the dimensionless mass of black hole, cis the light speed, ηis
the X-ray radiation efﬁciency ( η= 0.1for standard models), LEddis the Eddington luminosity. ˙mcan be
expressed as L/LEdd.LEdd= 1.25×1038merg s−1whenη= 0.1(Wang et al. 2012). In M87 hot ac-
cretion ﬂow, ηis about10−5(Di Matteo et al. 2003). The luminosity of black hole is L= 4πr2Ferg s−1,
whereFis ﬂux,ris the distance of M87. Then we can get the mass accretion rate of M87 as:
˙M=L
LEdd×η10−5
η0.1×˙MEdd, (2)
whereη0.1=η/0.1andη10−5=η/10−5. With this formula, we ﬁnd that the X-ray luminosity is in
proportion to the mass accretion rate which is also mentione d by Ishibashi & Courvoisier (2009).
In the past, both theory and observation supported that the a ccretion ﬂow around black hole in LLAGNs
was inhomogeneous (Celotti & Rees 1999). Due to thermal inst ability and viscous instability, it would
create cold clumps in the disc (Krolik 1998) and then fallbac k into the central black hole. During the process
of accretion, the clump will be disrupted by tidal force and r elease a burst of energy (Celotti & Rees 1999;
Strubbe & Quataert 2009). As for the mass accretion rate of cl umpy gas, Xiang & Cheng (2020) derived a
solution as follows:
˙M(x,τ) =˙M0(1
2x−2x
τ)x3/4
τe−1+x2
τI1/4(2x
τ), (3)
and
τ= (t−t0)/τ0, (4)
where˙M0= 6πνΣ0,Σ0is the initial surface density of the clumpy gas (Xiang & Chen g 2020), νis
kinematic viscosity parameter ( ?),xcan be written in R/R0and represents the dimensionless distance to
central BH and R0is the radius where the clump forms, R0is about100RSch∼1000RSch(Wang et al.
2012),t0stands for the start date of the clumpy accretion, τ0is the time-scale of gas falling and I1/4is the
modiﬁed Bessel function.
From 2007 to 2008 data, Xiang & Cheng (2020) found there was an obvious anti-correlation between
photon index and ﬂux. Based on this characteristic, Xiang & C heng (2020) divided the states of nucleus
into two types and those ﬁve points with lower ﬂux and higher i ndex were deﬁned as the ‘ﬁrst class’; three
points with higher ﬂux and lower index were deﬁned as the ‘sec ond class’. The ﬁrst class of low state was
corresponding to the pure ADAF model (Li et al. 2009) and had b een successfully ﬁtted by clumpy accretion
model (Xiang & Cheng 2020). The second class of high state cou ld be separated into two components, an
ADAF component and a ﬂaring component, and the former might a lso match the value of disc evolution.
However, this classiﬁcation method can not work well for the long-term light curve. It can be seen from the
right panel of Fig. 2 that there is no obvious bimodal structu re in the histogram distribution of photon index8 Y .-L. Cheng et al.

and ﬂux in the 12 years observations. In order to get the year- scale variation in the light curve, we propose
a universal classiﬁcation method for this two states. The sp eciﬁc classiﬁcation steps are as follows:
Select all points within a half year period around each point . If there are no points in the range, select the
two nearest points on the left and right. We check whether thi s point is the maximum value in this range and
is 50% higher than the average value of the rest points. For po ints satisfying the condition, it is considered
to be at ﬂaring state. After removing these points, this calc ulation process is repeated until there are no new
ﬂaring state points identiﬁed.
The results obtained by this method are shown in Fig. 3. These blue triangle points are classiﬁed into
non-ﬂaring state which are considered to be accompanied by t he clumpy accretion activities. These points
marked in magenta dots are at ﬂaring state which are related t o the ﬂare events. Meanwhile, the distin-
guished ﬂaring state and non-ﬂaring state from 2007 to 2008 a re consistent with the classiﬁcation results in
Xiang & Cheng (2020).
To meet the conditions of the model ﬁtting, it is necessary fo r us to divide the starting and ending
time of the accretion process from the long-term observatio ns. After excluding those ﬂaring state points,
we ﬁnd that there are ﬁve local minimum of brightness (segmen ted by the gray line in Fig. 3). For the
clumpy accretion model, the light curve will experience a ra pid increase and then slow decrease during the
accretion process (Wang et al. 2012). However, the decline r ate after the ﬂare event in April 2010 is much
faster than the ascent rate of 2009, which is inconsistent wi th the physical characteristics described by the
accretion model. Therefore, we do not take it as the beginnin g or end of the accretion process (the position is
shown by gray dotted line in Fig. 3). Based on this standard, 4 candidate clumpy accretion components are
identiﬁed. The ﬁrst component contains the entire time peri od of the accretion process in Xiang & Cheng
(2020). Fitted these candidate accretion parts with formul a (3), we get the results shown in Fig. 4 and the
ﬁtting parameters are listed in Table 2. Meanwhile, we label the nine observations of ﬂaring state with a

4 DISCUSSION
4.1 The Physical Characteristics of Clumpy Accretion
In Fig. 4, it shows that those non-ﬂaring state observations are basically on the ﬁtting curve which illustrate
that our classiﬁcation method for clumpy accretion is reaso nable. Although the luminosity dropped sharply
to a very low state after the ﬂare in 2010, it didn’t bring a gre at inﬂuence to the long-term evolution of the
disc. We give a more detailed explanation of this phenomenon in Section 4.3.
Based on the parameters listed in Table 2, we can ﬁnd that all o f the dimensionless distance to central BH
(x)are no more than 0.05, which indicates that the region where t he clumps form is very close to the black
hole. Our ﬁtting results for the ﬁrst clump are consistent wi th the results in Xiang & Cheng (2020). Although
the size of the source region adopted in this paper ( 0.8′′×2.6′′) is smaller than that in Xiang & Cheng (2020)
(1.8′′×2.3′′) which leads to higher luminosity and mass accretion rate, i t doesn’t change the position where
the clump forms. Meanwhile, it can be seen from Fig. 4 that the accretion on the black hole is discontinuous
and the size of the clump is randomly generated. Since the sol ution of the clumpy accretion is a function of
mass accretion rate with time, the mass of the clump could be o btained through integration of ˙Mby time.
When the mass accretion rate is lower than 0.1M⊙yr−1, the radiation generated by accretion is very weak.
Therefore, we take 0.1M⊙yr−1as the minimum threshold of the clumpy accretion. We deﬁne th e time10 Y .-L. Cheng et al.

range above this threshold as the accretion time-scale ( ∆T) of a clumpy accretion. Based on this standard,
we ﬁnd that the accretion of the last gas clump had not been com pleted within the selected observation time
range. According to the results predicted by the model, the a ccretion rate would drop to 0.1M⊙yr−1on
February 11th, 2020. Then we get the mass of each clump by inte gral calculation. As the morphology of
the clump is spherical, the radius of a clump could be estimat ed byRc= (3Mc/(4πnclmp))1

coefﬁcient is 0.98. The ﬁtting parameter: q1= 0.16±0.01. From the linear ﬁtting result, we can deduce that
the time-scale of clumpy accretion is determined by the size of the gas clump. With a mass of ∼0.16M⊙,
the accretion process will last for about one year and lead to the variation of the X-ray luminosity.
4.2 TheΓ—F2−10KeV Correlation Between Flaring State and Non-ﬂaring State
The correlation between the photon index and ﬂux in very-hig h-energy (VHE) gamma-rays of M87 have
been discussed by Acciari et al. (2008). Due to the small numb er of observations, no obvious correlation
was found. However, the long-term X-ray observations provi des enough data for us to study the relationship
between this two parameters. In order to test if there is any d ifference of the Γ—F2−10keV distribution
between the ﬂaring state and non-ﬂaring state, we take the ph oton index ( Γ) and the ﬂux of the two states
respectively. Then ﬁtting these two parameters with a linea r test function Γ =p0+p1Φ0. The results
are shown in Fig. 6. The χ2/dof of the linear ﬁt of the non-ﬂaring state is 43.68/45, with the parameter
p1=−0.10±0.01; theχ2/dof of the linear ﬁt of the ﬂaring state is 6.39/7, with the parame terp1=
−0.04±0.02. However, as p1is consistent with zero, a constant photon index ﬁt is applie d to compare with
the linear ﬁtting results. The constant ﬁt gave a χ2/dof of 97.75/46 and 8.87/8 for the non-ﬂaring state andThe year-scale X-ray variations of M87 11

ﬂaring state, respectively. As a consequence, the ﬁtting re sult shows that the ﬂux is inversely proportional
to the photon index for the non-ﬂaring state (clumpy accreti on components). For the ﬂaring state (ﬂare
components), due to the χ2/dof of the linear ﬁt is consistent with the χ2/dof of constant ﬁt, no signiﬁcant
evidence is provided for there is any correlation between th e two parameters.
The anti-correlation between photon index and ﬂux in X-ray b and is also predicted by ADAF model
(Yuan et al. 2007). For LLAGNs, the X-ray emission is mainly d ominated by the Comptonization of the hot
gas in ADAF (Gu & Cao 2009; Xiang & Cheng 2020). However, accor ding to the distribution of the two
parameters, we can see that there is a cross connection betwe en the non-ﬂaring state and ﬂaring state. For
the ﬂare in 2008, the peak ﬂux reached 8.02 ×10−12erg s−1cm−2, with the photon index of 1.76 (number
1 in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6). Then the intensity dropped to 4.96 ×10−12erg s−1cm−2, and the photon index
was 1.72 (number 2 in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6), almost the same as befo re. This shows that the event dominated
by the ﬂare varies greatly of the ﬂux intensity, but keep the s ame feature of the photon index as the ﬂare.
Meanwhile, Γ–F2−10keV distribution of the ﬂaring states seems to present two branc hes. Such branches
may imply different origin mechanism of the ﬂares. Carry out high-frequency follow-up observation after
the ﬂare events may help us to understand the physical mechan ism of this process.
4.3 Why Can the Luminosity be Lower Than the Clumpy Accretion Component?
It can be seen from the distribution of light curve in Fig. 4 th at the ﬂare often occurs at a high mass accretion
rate. After the intensity reaches the peak, a sudden decreas e in luminosity will be accompanied within a few
days. The ﬂare event in 2010 was particularly representativ e. The luminosity declined by 52.04% in two
days after the peak intensity (number 4 in Fig. 4 ). At this tim e, the luminosity was consistent with that of
the non-ﬂaring state. And then the luminosity decreased by 2 8.41% over the next 30 days. A light variability12 Y .-L. Cheng et al.
in 2017 is also very similar to this situation. We ﬁnd that aft er the ﬂare (number 6 in Fig. 4 ), the luminosity
decreased by 27.10% within three days which was consistent w ith the ADAF components. Due to the lack of
observations afterwards, it can not be sure whether the lumi nosity will continue to decrease for a period. But
it is not a coincidence that the luminosity changes rapidly i n a short time after the ﬂare. Then, we analyze
the origin mechanism of the ﬂare and put forward a possible ex planation for the above phenomenon.
The M87 image captured by EHT presents that the inhomogeneou s ring-like structure seems to be
clumpy. Meanwhile, the polarization map of M87 shows that th ere is strong magnetic ﬁeld around the
black hole (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 20 21a), which is closely related to the accretion
mode of the black hole. Now it has been conﬁrmed that the accre tion ﬂow in M87 is magnetically-arrested
disk (MAD, Xie & Zdziarski 2019; Event Horizon Telescope Col laboration et al. 2021b), and it is based on
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations (G RMHD, McKinney et al. 2012; Yuan & Narayan
2014). In MHD model, there are magnetic arcades emerging fro m the disc into corona (Yuan et al.
2009). The formed ﬂux ropes keep a balance between the magnet ic compression and magnetic tension.
Nevertheless,the equilibrium will be broken down by the tur bulence in the photosphere and leads to rapid
magnetic reconnection (Lin et al. 2003; Yuan et al. 2009).In this process, part of the energy transfers into
the kinetic power of the plasma to ignite the ﬂares, and part o f it pushes the mass through the corona.
Our analysis shows that the ﬂare might be triggered by magnet ic reconnection, and the huge energy
released from the process could blow material away from the a ccretion disc. As the structure of the accre-
tion disc is destroyed, the luminosity decreases rapidly. H owever, with the accretion of the gas clump, the
damaged part will be reﬁlled. As a consequence, the luminosi ty returns to normal. This further shows that
the ﬂare does not have a great impact on the overall evolution of the accretion disc, which is consistent with
the conclusion in Section 4.1.
5 CONCLUSIONS
We search the long-term X-ray variation of M87 from Chandra archival data. In our analysis, 56 observa-
tions from 2007 to 2019 are adopted. We distinguished the ‘no n-ﬂaring state’ from ‘ﬂaring state’ with a
universal classiﬁcation method. The evolution of the non-ﬂ aring states could be well explained by the ac-
cretion of gas clumps. We also discussed the physical charac teristics of clumpy accretion. The main results
are listed as follows:
(i) From 2007 to 2019, the central black hole of M87 have accre ted 4 gas clumps. The time-scale of
accretion is determined by the size of the clump. Generally, it takes about one year to complete the accretion
process of a mass of ∼0.16M⊙.
(ii) We analyze the correlation of photon index against ﬂux b etween the non-ﬂaring state and ﬂaring
state. By linear ﬁtting, we ﬁnd that there is a signiﬁcant ant i-correlation between the two parameters of
non-ﬂaring states. However, the correlation is not signiﬁc ant for ﬂaring states.
(iii) The ﬂare always occurs at a high mass accretion rate. Af tering the ﬂare, there could be a steep
luminosity drop to a level lower than that of the ADAF compone nts. This hints that there might be a strong
magnetic ﬁeld around the black hole and ﬂares could be relate d to the magnetic reconnections. The energyThe year-scale X-ray variations of M87 13
released by this process might temporarily destroy the stru cture of the disc. However, with the accretion of
gas clumps, the damaged part could be ﬁlled again, and then th e system returns to normal.
