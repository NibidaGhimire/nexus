Abstract
In this paper, we obtain a generalization of Grothendieck’s theorem for the space of con-
tinuous mappings Cλ,µ(X,Y) whereYis a complete uniform space with the uniformity µ
endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on the family λof subsets of X. A new
topological game is deﬁned - the Asanov-Velichko game, which makes it possible to single
out a class of topological spaces of the Grothendieck type.
The developed technique is used to generalize the Grothendieck’s th eorem for the space
of continuous mappings endowed with the set-open topology.

1. Introduction
In 1952 Grothendieck [14] proved the following result.
Theorem 1.1. (Grothendieck) Let Xbe a compact space and let Ybe a metrizable space.
Then each relatively countably compact subspace of Cp(X,Y)is relatively compact.
This theorem has played an important role in topology and functional analysis.
Grothendieck’s theorem has been generalized many times [2, 12, 17 , 18]. The following
successful generalization of this theorem is due to M.O. Asanov and N.V. Velichko [8].
Theorem 1.2. If a spaceXis countably compact, then each bounded subset of Cp(X)is
relatively compact.
Let us recall two theorems proved by A.V. Arhangel’skii [5].
Theorem 1.3. If a Tychonoﬀ space Xcontains a dense σ-countably pracompact subspace
Y, then every pseudocompact subspace PofCp(X)is an Eberlein compactum.

Preprint submitted to ... July 20, 2023Theorem 1.4. If a Tychonoﬀ space Xcontains a dense σ-pseudocompact subspace Y, then
every countably compact subspace PofCp(X)is an Eberlein compactum.
In this paper, we investigate a generalization of the Grothendieck’s theorem for the
space of continuous mappings Cλ,µ(X,Y) whereYis a complete uniform space with uni-
formityµendowed with the topology of uniform convergence on the family λof subsets of
X. Also, the developed technique is used to generalize the Grothendie ck’s theorem for the
space of continuous mappings Cλ(X,R) endowed with the set-open ( λ-open) topology.
2. Notation and terminology
The set of positive integers is denoted by Nandω=N∪{0}. LetRbe the real line,
we putI= [0,1]⊂R, and let Qbe the rational numbers. We denote by A(orClXA) the
closure ofA(inX).
LetXbe a topological space. Let ( Y,µ) be a uniform space and λ⊆2X. A topology
onC(X,Y) generated by the uniformity
ν={/a\}bracketle{tA,M/a\}bracketri}ht ⊆C(X,Y)×C(X,Y) :A∈λ,M∈µ}
where
/a\}bracketle{tA,M/a\}bracketri}ht={/a\}bracketle{tf,g/a\}bracketri}ht ∈C(X,Y)×C(X,Y) :∀x∈A/a\}bracketle{tf(x),g(x)/a\}bracketri}ht ∈M}
is called the topology of uniform convergence on elements of λand denote by Cλ,µ(X,Y).
The well-known fact is that if λis the family of all compact subsets of Xor all ﬁnite
subsets ofXthen the topology on C(X,Y) induced by the uniformity νof uniform con-
vergence on elements of λdepends only on the topology induced on Yby the uniformity
µ(see [13]). In these cases, we use the notation Cc(X,Y) andCp(X,Y), respectively. If
Y=RthenCc(X) andCp(X), respectively.
In case (Y,ρ) is a metric space and the uniformity µis induced by the metric ρ, then
forCλ,µ(X,Y), we use the notation Cλ,ρ(X,Y) andCλ,ρ(X) for the case Y=R.
IfX∈λ, we writeCµ(X,Y) in place of Cλ,µ(X,Y) andCµ(X) in place of Cµ(X,R).
Remark 2.1. For the topology of uniform convergence on elements of λ, we assume that
the following natural conditions hold:
(1) ifA∈λandA′⊆AthenA′∈λ.
(2) ifA1,A2∈λthenA1/uniontextA2∈λ.
(3) ifA∈λthenA∈λ.
Note that Cλ,µ(X,Y) is Hausdorﬀ if and only if the set/uniontextλis dense in X, i.e.,/uniontext{A:A∈λ}=X(see [9]).
Then we have an additional condition on λ.
(4)λis a cover of X.
Theset-open topology onafamily λofnon-emptysubsets oftheset Xisageneralization
of the compact-open topologyandof the topologyof pointwise con vergence. This topology,
ﬁrst introduced by Arens andDugunji in[7], isoneof theimportantt opologieson C(X,Y).
2IfA⊆XandV⊆Y, then [A,V] is deﬁned as [ A,V] ={f∈C(X,Y) :f(A)⊆V}.
LetXandYbe topological spaces, λ⊆2X. A topology on C(X,Y) is called a λ-open
topology (set-open topology) if the family {[A,V] :A∈λandVis open inY}form a
subbase for the topology. The function space C(X,Y) with this topology is denoted by
Cλ(X,Y).
Recall that a subset Aof a topological space Xis called
•relatively compact ifAhas a compact closure in X.
•boundedif every continuous function on Xis bounded on A.
•relatively countably compact if each sequence of Ahas a limit point in X.
•pseudocompact if any continuous real-valued function on Ais bounded.
A topological space Xis called countably pracompact if there is a subspace Y⊆X
which is dense in Xand countably compact in Xin the following sense: every inﬁnite set
A⊆Yhas a limit point in X.
A space is called σ-compact (σ-countably compact, etc.) if it is theunion of a countable
set of compact (respectively, countably compact, etc.) subspac es.
AGδ-neighborhood of a point xin a spaceXis called a set Vcontainingxwhich is the
intersection of a countable number of open sets.

3. Asanov-Velichko game and compactness in Cp(X,Y)
LetXbe a topological space, let λbe a family of subsets of Xand letAbe a non-closed
subset ofXandx∈A\A.
The following game on the space Xwill be called the Asanov–Velichko game generated
by the family λ.
Player ONE chooses at the n-th step of the game a neighborhood Vnof the point x.
Player TWO chooses at the n-th step of the game a subset Snof the setAwhich lies in
the closure of some Tn∈λ. The game is played with a countable number of steps. We say
that the game is won by player TWO if the set/uniontext{Sn:n∈N}∩(/intersectiontext{Vn:n∈N})/\e}atio\slash=∅and
— by player ONE otherwise. This game will be denoted by AVλ(X).
The following deﬁnition generalizes the notions of weakly p- and weakly q-spaces intro-
duced in [8].
Deﬁnition 3.1. A spaceXis called Asanov-Velichko generated by the family λ(AVλ-
space)if for any non-closed subset AofXthere is a point x∈A\Afor which player TWO
has a winning strategy in the game AVλ(X).
In what follows, we will need two deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 3.2. LetXbe a topological space. A family λof subsets of Xwill be called
countably invariant ifλcontains all singletons of Xand the fact that An∈λfor every
n∈Nimplies/uniontext{An:n∈N} ∈λ.
3Deﬁnition 3.3. ([5])Property Pofsubsetsofatopologicalspace Xiscalleda continuously
invariant property if the facts that Ais a subset of Xwith the property Pandf:X→Y
is a continuous map imply that f(A) has the property Pinf(X).
The following proposition makes it easy to prove generalizations of th e Grothendieck’s
theorem.
Proposition 3.4. LetXbe anAVλ-space where λis a countably invariant family of
subsets ofX. LetPbe a continuously invariant property of subsets of X, and the following
condition is satisﬁed:
(γ)for everyZ∈λand everyB⊆πZ(Cp(X))with the property P,Bis compact.
Then for every F⊆Cp(X), having the property P,Fis relatively compact.
Proof.Note that to prove the proposition it is enough to prove that FCp(X)=FRX
.
Indeed, for any x∈Xthe setπx(F) is compact and, therefore, FRX
⊆/producttext{πx(F) :x∈X}
is compact.
SupposeFCp(X)/\e}atio\slash=FRX
, that is, there is a discontinuous function f∈FRX
. Then
there is a closed subset MofRsuch thatC=f−1(M) is not closed in X. SinceXis an
AVλ-space, there is x0∈C\C, for which player TWO has a winning strategy in the game
AVλ(X). Letǫ=ρ(f(x0),M), thenǫ>0.
The facts that λis countably invariant and the condition ( γ) imply that πx0(F) is
compact. Therefore, there is f1∈Fsuch thatπx0(f) =πx0(f1), i.e.,f1(x0) =f(x0). Let
V1=f−1
1({r∈R:ρ(f(x0),r)<1}). LetS1⊆CandT1∈λbe the sets selected by the
player TWO according to the winning strategy in the game AVλ(X).
Suppose that the functions f1,...,f n, the neighborhoods V1,...,V nofx0, the subsets
S1,...,S nofC, and the elements T1,...,T nofλ, such that Si⊆Tifor everyi= 1,...,n
are constructed. By condition ( γ), the projection of the set FontoL=/uniontext{Ti:i=
1,...,n} ∪ {x0}is compact, hence, there is fn+1∈Fsuch thatπL(f) =πL(fn+1). Let
Vn+1=f−1
n+1({r∈R:ρ(f(x0),r)<1
n+1})∩Vn. LetSn+1⊆CandTn+1∈λbe the sets
chosen by player TWO.
Regarding the constructed families {fi:i∈N},{Vi:i∈N},{Si:i∈N}and
{Ti:i∈N}, sinceXis anAVλ-space, there is x∞∈/uniontext{Sn:n∈N}∩(/intersectiontext{Vn:n∈N}).
ConsiderY=/uniontext{Ti:i∈N} ∪ {x∞} ∪ {x0}. By condition ( γ),πY(F) is compact,
that is, there exists f∞∈Fsuch thatπY(f) =πY(f∞). Then the following conditions are
satisﬁed:
(1)f∞(x∞) =f(x0);
(2)f∞(x) =f(x) for every x∈/uniontext{Ti:i∈N}becauseπY(f) =πY(f∞) andπY(f∞) is
a limit function for the set πY({fi:i∈N}).
LetT= (/uniontext{Ti:i∈N})\{x∈X:ρ(f(x),f(x∞))<3
4ǫ}.
By conditions (1) and (2), ρ(f∞(x),f∞(x))≥3
4ǫfor everyx∈T. If we prove that
x∞∈T, then we obtain a contradiction with the fact that f∞is continuous.
Indeed, let O(x∞) be an arbitrary neighborhood of the point x∞, then there is x′and
n∈Nsuch thatx′∈Sn∩O(x∞). LetH=Tn∪{x′}. By condition ( γ),πH(F) is compact,
4hence, there exists f′∈Fsuch thatπH(f) =πH(f′). Sincef′is continuous, there is a
pointx′′∈Tnfor whichρ(f′(x′′),f′(x′))<1
4ǫ, but then
ρ(f(x′′),f(x0))≥ρ(f(x′),f(x0))−ρ(f′(x′′),f′(x′))≥ǫ−1
4ǫ=3
4ǫ, i.e.,x′′∈T∩O(x∞).
Recall that a compactum Fis called an Eberlein compactum if there is a compactum
Xsuch thatFis homeomorphic to a subspace of Cp(X).
The following theorem is an obvious consequence of Theorem 1.3 and P roposition 3.4.
Theorem 3.5. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ AVλc-space where λcis a family of all of its subspaces
that have a dense σ-countably pracompact subspace. Then every pseudocompact subspace
inCp(X)is relatively compact.
The following result also follows from Theorem 1.4 and Proposition 3.4 .
Theorem 3.6. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ AVλp-space where λpis a family of all of its sub-
spaces with a dense σ-pseudocompact subspace. Then each countably pracompact s ubspace
inCp(X)is relatively compact.
There is an interesting similarity between Theorems 3.5 and 3.6 and the results (The-
orems 3.9 and 3.10) Archangel’skii in ([5] and [3]).
Deﬁnition 3.7. Letλbe a family of subsets of a topological space X. The space Xis
functionally generated by the family λif the following condition holds: for every discontin-
uous function f:X→Rthere isA∈λsuch that the function πA(f) cannot be extended
to a real-valued continuous function on all of X.
Proposition 3.8. (Proposition 4.10 in [5]) Let a Tychonoﬀ space Xbe functionally gen-
erated by a family λof its subsets, let Pbe a continuously invariant property, and let the
following condition hold:
(α)ifY∈λ, then for every B⊆πY(Cp(X))with the property P, the closure Bin
πY(Cp(X))is compact.
Then any subset of Cp(X)with the property P, is relatively compact.
Although the condition ( α) is somewhat diﬀerent from the condition ( γ), similarity
between Theorems 3.5 and 3.6 and two of the following theorems is str iking.
Theorem 3.9. (Theorem 8.1 in [3]). If a Tychonoﬀ space Xis functionally generated by a
familyλcof all of its closed subspaces that have a dense σ-countably pracompact subspace,
then the closure in Cp(X)of every pseudocompact subspace is compact.
Theorem 3.10. (Theorem 8.3 in [3]). If a Tychonoﬀ space Xis functionally generated by
a familyλpof all of its closed subspaces that contain a dense σ-pseudocompact subspace,
then the closure in Cp(X)of every countably pracompact subspace is compact.
As we will see later, a certain similarity between the results using func tional generation
and generation by Asanov-Velichko can be observed.
54. The Grothendieck’s theorem for spaces Cλ,µ(X,Y)
In this section, we prove two theorems that can be considered bas ic in this paper.
Recall that a topological space Xis called aµ-spaceif every bounded subset of Xis
relatively compact [10]. The class of µ–spaces arose in connection with the study of the
question of barrels of spaces of continuous real-valued functions Cc(X) with compact-open
topology. In 1973 H. Buchwolter proved that Cc(X) is barreled if and only if Xis aµ-
space. Later the notion of µ-space acquired a value of its own. The class of µ-spaces is
very wide, it includes all Dieudonn´ e complete spaces, in particular, a ll metrizable spaces.
Lemma 4.1. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ space and let Ybe a Tychonoﬀ µ–space with a countable
pseudocharacter. Let f:X→Ybe a condensation (= a continuous bijection). Then Xis
aµ-space.
Proof.Letf1:νX→νYbe a continuous extension of the function ffrom the Hewitt
real-compactiﬁcation νXofXonto the Hewitt real-compactiﬁcation νYofY(Theorem
3.11.16 in [13])). Now let Abe a bounded subset of X, thenAνXis compact (Proposition
6.9.7 in [6]). Let us prove that AX=AνX, i.e.AνX\X=∅. Let this not be the case and
there is a point x∈AνX\X. The setf(A) is bounded in Yandf(A)Yis compact, hence,
f1(AνX) =f(A)Y⊂Y. ThenV=f−1
1(f1(x)) is aGδ-neighbourhood of xbecause the
pseudocharacter ψ(f1(x),Y) of the point f1(x) inYis countable, and, hence, ψ(f1(x),νY)
is countable, too. Since the mapping fis one-to-one, V∩Xcontains only one point
x1. LetO(x) be a neighborhood of the point xinνXwhich does not contain x1. But
thenV1=V∩O(x) is aGδ-neighbourhood of the point xand is disjoint with X, which
contradicts the following assertion (Theorem 3.11.11 in [13]): for an y pointx∈νXand
for any of its neighborhoods V⊂νXthe intersection of V∩Xis not empty.
Deﬁnition 4.2. LetXbe a topological space. Let λbe a family of subsets of X. A subset
AofXis calledλ-separable if there is a countable subfamily λ1of the family λsuch that
A⊆/uniontext{B:B∈λ1}. IfA=XthenXis called aλ-separable space .
Lemma 4.3. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ λ-separable space for some family λof subsetsX.
ThenCλ,ρ(X)is submetrizable.
Proof.Letλ1be a countable subfamily of λsuch thatX=/uniontext{B:B∈λ1}. LetX1=/uniontext{B:B∈λ1}andλ2={A∩X1:A∈λ}. It is obvious that the mapping πX1:
Cλ,ρ(X)→Cλ2,ρ(X1) whereπX1(f) =f↾X1for everyf∈Cλ,ρ(X) is a condensation
becauseX1is dense in X. On the other hand, λ1⊆λ2and, hence, the identity mapping
e:Cλ1,ρ(X)→Cλ2,ρ(X1)isacondensation, too. Themapping f=e◦πX1isacondensation
fromCλ,ρ(X) onto the metrizable space Cλ1,ρ(X1) (Cλ1,ρ(X1) is metrizable by Proposition
4.9 in [1]).
Corollary 4.4. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ λ–separable space for some family λof subsets of
X. Then for every function h∈Cλ,ρ(X) there is a function f:Cλ,ρ(X)→Rsuch that
f(h) = 0 andf(h1)>0 for anyh1∈Cλ,ρ(X).
6Proof.Letg:Cλ,ρ(X)→Zbe a condensation of the space Cλ,ρ(X) onto a metric space
Z. Leth∈Cλ,ρ(X) andx=g(h). Thenf=f1◦gwhere the mapping f1:Z→Rsuch
thatf1(y) =d(x,y) for every y∈Z.
Proposition 4.5. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ space and let λbe a cover of X. IfFis a bounded
subset ofCλ,ρ(X)then for every λ-separableY⊆Xthere exists F1⊆Cλ,ρ(X)such that
F⊆F1andπY(F1) =πY(F)CλY,ρ(Y)is a metrizable compact space.
Proof.SinceYisλ-separable, there exists a condensation g:CλY,ρ(Y)→ZwhereZis a
metrizable space (Lemma 4.3). Since Zis a metrizable space, it is a µ-space with a count-
able pseudocharacter. By Lemma 4.1, CλY,ρ(Y) is aµ-space. The set πY(F) is bounded
inCλY,ρ(X) and, hence, it is relatively compact. Since the compact set πY(F)CλY,ρ(Y)
condenses into Z, then it is metrizable. For every point h∈πY(F)CλY,ρ(Y)the following
condition holds: π−1
Y(h)∩Cλ,ρ(X)/\e}atio\slash=∅.
Indeed, if this was not the case for some h1, then there would be a continuous function
φ:Cλ,ρ(Y)→Rsuch thatφ(h1) = 0 andφ(h)>0 forh/\e}atio\slash=h1(Corollary 4.4). Putting
φ1=1
xfor everyx∈(0,+∞),φ1: (0,+∞)→Rwe would have a continuous function
φ1◦φ◦πY:Cλ,ρ(X)→Rwhich is unbounded on F. Thus, we have F1=/uniontext{π−1
Y(h) :h∈
πY(F)CλY,ρ(Y)}.
Ifλis a family of subsets of a topological space X, then the family of all countable
unions of elements of λwill be denoted by σλ.
LetXbe a topological space, λ⊆2X. LetQ={B⊆X:A∩Bis closed in Afor all
A∈λ}. LetXλbe a setXwith the topology τ={X\B:B∈Q}. Further, we will call
such space a λ-leaderofX.
LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ space, λ⊆2X. LetXτλbe a Tychonoﬀ modiﬁcation of the
λ-leaderXλof the space X. Further, we will call such space λf-leaderofXand denote by
Xτλ(see more about λ- andλf-leaders ofXin [1]).
Theorem 4.6. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ AVσλ-space for some cover λofX. ThenCλ,ρ(X)
is aµ-space.
Proof.Lete:Xτλ→Xbe a natural condensation of the λf-leaderXτλonX. Denote
byZ=Ce−1(λ),ρ(Xτλ). LetFbe a bounded subset of Cλ,ρ(X), thenF0=FZis compact
becauseZis a complete uniform space (a µ-space).
It suﬃces to show that F0⊂Cλ,ρ(X). Letf∈F0. Let us prove that f∈Cλ,ρ(X).
Assume the contrary, i.e. that fis a discontinuous function from XtoR. Then there
is a closed set B⊂Rsuch thatA=f−1(B) is not closed in X. SinceXis anAVσλ-space,
there is a point x0∈A\Afor which player TWO has a winning strategy in the game
AVσλ(X). Putǫ=ρ(f(x0),B). SinceBis closed,ǫ>0.
The fact that f∈F0implies that there is a function f1∈Fsuch that |f(x0)−f1(x0)|<
1
2. Sinceλis a cover of X,{x0} ∈λ(Remark 2.1).
7LetV1={x∈X:|f(x0)−f1(x)|<1
2. ThenV1is a neighborhood of x0. LetS1⊆A
andT1=/uniontext{Ai
1∈λ:i∈N} ∈σλbe a set chosen by player TWO according to the
winning strategy in the game AVσλ(X). LetP1=A1∈λ.
Suppose that the functions f1,...,fn, the neighborhoods V1,...,Vnofx0, the subsets
S1,...,SnofA, the elements T1,...,Tnof the family σλsuch thatSj⊆Tjfor everyj=
1,...,nandTj=/uniontext{Ai
j∈λ:i∈N} ∈σλare constructed. Put Pn=n/uniontext
i=1n/uniontext
j=1Ai
j∪{x0} ∈λ
(see Remark 2.1). Then there is a function fn+1such that |f(x)−fn+1(x)|<(1
2)n+1
for everyx∈Pn. LetVn+1={x∈X:|f(x0)−fn+1(x)|<(1
2)n+1}. ThenVn+1is a
neighborhood of x0. Let sets Sn+1⊆AandTn+1=/uniontext{Ai
n+1∈λ:i∈N} ∈σλare
chosen by player TWO according to the winning strategy in the game AVσλ(X). Put
Pn+1=n+1/uniontext
i=1n+1/uniontext
j=1Ai
j∪{x0} ∈λ.
Continuing this process, by induction we construct countable sets {fi:i∈N},{Vi:
i∈N},{Si:i∈N}and{Ti:i∈N}. SinceXis anAVσλ-space, there is a point
xω∈/uniontext{Si:i∈N}∩(/intersectiontext{Vi:i∈N}).
PutY=/uniontext{Ti:i∈N} ∪ {x0} ∪ {xω}. There is a function fω∈Cλ,ρ(X) such that
πY(fω)∈πY({fi:i∈N})CλY,ρ(Y)(see Proposition 4.5). Then two conditions hold:
(1)fω(xω) =f(x0) becausexω∈/intersectiontext{Vi:i∈N};
(2)fω(x) =f(x) for every x∈/uniontext{Ti:i∈N}.
LetT= (/uniontext{Ti:i∈N})\{x∈X:|f(x0)−f(x)|<3
4ǫ}.
By conditions (1) and (2), |fω(x0)−fω(x)|/greaterorequalslant3
4ǫfor everyx∈T. If we get that xω∈T,
then we obtain a contradiction with a continuity of fω, and the theorem can be proven.
Indeed, let O(xω) be an arbitrary neighborhood of the point xω. Then there is a point
x1andn∈Nsuch thatx1∈Sn∩O(xω).
The setH=Tn∪ {x1}isλ-separable and, by Proposition 4.5, there is a function
f′∈Ce−1(λ),ρ(Xτλ) such that πH(f′) =πH(f). Sincef′is continuous, there exists a point
x2∈Tnsuch that |f′(x1)−f′(x2)|<1
4ǫ. But then
|f(x2)−f(x0)|/greaterorequalslant|f(x1)−f(x0)|−|f′(x1)−f′(x2)|/greaterorequalslantǫ−1
4ǫ=3
4ǫ, i.e.x2∈T∩O(xω).
Theorem 4.6 is a generalization of the Asanov-Velichko theorem in [8]. It is interesting
to note that in Theorem 4.6 we can replace the assumption that Xis anAVλ-space with
the assumption that Xis functionally generated by the family λ. This similarity forces us
to ﬁnd out the relationship between classes of AVλ-spaces and spaces that are functionally
generated by the same family λof subsets.
Proposition 4.7. There is a Tychonoﬀ space Xfunctionally generated by a family λcof
all of its non-empty countable subsets, which is not an AVλc-space.
Proof.LetX=/producttext{Rα:α∈Λ}whereRα=Rfor allα∈Λ where |Λ|is an uncountable
Ulam non-measurable cardinal [19]. Then Xis functionally generated by a family λcof all
of its countable subsets (see [20]). Let us prove that Xis not anAVλc-space.
8Let us introduce some notation: let y= (yα)∈/producttext{Rα:α∈Λ},supp(y) ={α:yα/\e}atio\slash=
0}; a pointyfor whichsupp(y) =∅will be denoted by 0; ifMis a subset of Xthen
supp(M) =/uniontext{supp(y) :y∈M}.
Letn∈NandA={y∈X:|supp(y)|/lessorequalslantnand (∀α:yα/\e}atio\slash= 0⇔yα=n)}.
Let us prove the following fact: there is no such point x∈A\Athat player TWO has
a winning strategy in the game AVλc(X).
(1) Let us check that A\A={0}. Letx∈X\Aandx/\e}atio\slash=0, then three cases are
possible:
(a)∃α0∈supp(x) such that xα0is not an integer;
(b)∃α0
1,α0
2∈supp(x) such that xα0
1=i/\e}atio\slash=j=xα0
2wherei,j∈N;
(c)∃α0
1,...,α0
n+1∈supp(x) such that xα0
1=...=xα0
n+1=n.
In all three cases, the point xhas a neighborhood Vsuch thatV∩A=∅.
(a)V={y∈X:|xα0−yα0|<ǫ}whereǫ= min{|xα0−n|:n∈N};
(b)V={y∈X:|xα0
1−yα0
1|<1
2and|xα0
2−yα0
2|<1
2};
(c)V={y∈X:|yα0
i−xα0
i|<1
2for everyi= 1,...,n+1}.
Thus, we have proved that A\A={0}.
(2) Prove that player TWO does not have a winning strategy in the ga meAVλc(X) on
the setAand at the point 0. Moreover, we prove that player ONE does have a winning
strategy.
Let us check that the choice of player TWO in every round of the gam e can only be a
countable set Si. Note that Sicontains at most a countable number of points having the
samesupp. Ontheother hand, if y∈Ti, thenthere is y′∈Tisuch thatsupp(y) =supp(y′).
SinceTi∈λcand, hence, it is countable, Siis countable, too.
Now let the set S1be chosen by player TWO at the ﬁrst step of the game. Let
H1=supp(S1). We renumber the set H1={α1
i:i∈N}. Take a neighborhood of the
point0chosen by the player ONE, the set V1={x∈X:|xα1
1|<1
2}. Let the game already
passm−1 steps and the set Sm⊆Ais chosen by the player TWO at the m-th step of the
Asanov-Velichko game, let Hm=supp(Sm) ={αm
i:i∈N}.
LetVm={x∈X:∀i,∀j:i/lessorequalslantj/lessorequalslantm,|xαi
j|<1
2}. And so on. At the end of the
game we get: for every x∈/intersectiontext{Vm:m∈N} |xα|<1
2for anyα∈H=/uniontext{Hm:m∈N}.
On the other hand, for every x∈/uniontext{Sm:m∈N}there isα∈Hsuch thatxα/greaterorequalslant1. So/uniontext{Sm:m∈N}∩(/intersectiontext{Vm:m∈N}) =∅.
Proposition 4.8. There is a Tychonoﬀ AVλc-spaceXwhereλcis a family of all of its
non-empty countable subsets, but Xis not functionally generated by λc.
Proof.LetX=T(ω1+1) be the set of all ordinals less than ω1+1 in the order topology
(see Example 3.1.27 in [13]). The space Xis compact and, hence, is an AVλc-space.
ButXis not functionally generated by the family λc, because the function
f(α) =/braceleftbigg0, ifα<ω 1,
1, if α=ω1
9is discontinuous, but f↾Sis continuous for any countable set S.
To conclude thissection, wepresent atheoremthat reduces thep roblem ofcompactness
of subsets in Cλ,µ(X,Y) to the case in Cp(X,Y).
A continuously invariant property Pis ofboundedness type if and only if it implies
boundedness, that is, if every subspace YofXwith the property Pis bounded in X
(Proposition 2.15 in [3]).
Theorem 4.9. LetXbe a Hausdorﬀ topological space, let λbe a cover of X, and letY
be a complete Hausdorﬀ uniform space with uniformity µ. Then, if Pis a boundedness
type property such that any subset of Cp(X,Y)that has this property is relatively compact
inCp(X,Y), then every subset of Cλ,µ(X,Y)with the property P, is relatively compact in
Cλ,µ(X,Y).
Proof.LetF⊆Cλ,µ(X,Y) have the property Pand lete:Xτλ→Xbe a natural
condensation of the λf-leaderXτλofXontoX. By Corollary 4.3 in [1], the map e#:
Cλ,µ(X,Y)→Ce−1(λ),µ(Xτλ,Y) is an embedding, and the set e#(F) has the property
P(moreover, e#(F) is bounded). Since Ce−1(λ),µ(Xτλ,Y) is a complete uniform space
(see Proposition 4.7 in [1]) (hence, a µ-space), the closure of the set e#(F) in the space
Ce−1(λ),µ(Xτλ,Y) is compact.
If we now prove that e#(FCλ,µ(X,Y)) =e#(F)Ce−1(λ),µ(Xτλ,Y)then, due to the fact that
the mapping e#is an embedding, we get that FCλ,µ(X,Y)is compact.
Note that the set Fhas the property Pin spaceCp(X,Y). Since the identity map-
pingidC(X,Y):Cλ,µ(X,Y)→Cp(X,Y) is continuous, the space Cp(X,Y) has a weaker
topology than the topology of Cλ,µ(X,Y) and, by the hypotheses of the theorem, Fis rel-
atively compact in Cp(X,Y). SinceFCp(X,Y)is compact, the set e#(FCp(X,Y)) is compact
inCp(Xτλ,Y). On the other hand, since the mapping e#:Cp(X,Y)→Cp(Xτλ,Y) is
continuous (see [4], Corollary 2.8), e#(FCp(X,Y)) =e#(F)Cp(Xτλ,Y).
Since the identity mapping idC(Xτλ,Y):Ce−1(λ),µ(Xτλ,Y)→Cp(Xτλ,Y) is continuous
(see [4]),e#(F)Ce−1(λ),µ(Xτλ,Y)⊆e#(F)Cp(Xτλ,Y), i.e.e#(F)Ce−1(λ),µ(Xτλ,Y)⊆e#(Cλ,µ(X,Y)).
Theorem 4.9 implies the following corollaries.
Corollary 4.10. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ space and let λbe a cover of X. IfXis anAVγc-
space or functionally generated by a family γcof all of its subspaces that have a dense
σ-countably pracompact subset, then each pseudocompact subs et inCλ,ρ(X) is relatively
compact.
Proof.It suﬃces to refer to Theorems 4.9 and 3.5 of this paper and Theore m 8.1 in [3].
Corollary 4.11. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ space and let λbe a cover of X. IfXis anAVγp-
space or functionally generated by a family γpof all of its subspaces that have a dense
σ-pseudocompact subset, then each countably pracompact subs et inCλ,ρ(X) is relatively
compact.
10Proof.It suﬃces to refer to Theorems 4.9 and 3.6 of this paper and Theore m 8.3 in [3].
Corollary 4.12. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ space and let λbe a cover of X. IfXis anAVγ-
space or functionally generated by a family γof all of its countable subsets, then the space
Cλ,ρ(X) is aµ-space.
Proof.It suﬃces to refer to Theorem 4.9 of this paper, Theorem 1 in [8] an d Theorem 2.16
in [3].
To indicate the span of the classes of spaces that cover these cor ollaries, we indicate
that Corollary 4.12 applies to
(1)q-spaces in the sense E. Michael [15], in particular, countably compa ct spaces;
(2) quasi-k–spaces in the sense of Ju. Nagata [16], in particular, k-spaces;
(3) spaces of countable tightness, in particular, sequential and F rechet–Urysohn spaces;
(4) locally separable spaces;
(5) spaces of countable functional tightness (see [5] and [8]).
Corollary 5.7 also applies to σ-pseudocompact spaces.
5. Grothendieck’s theorem for Cλ(X)
The purpose of this section is to prove a theorem analogous to Theo rem 4.9. For this
we need two lemmas.
Lemma 5.1. LetX= lim
←{Xα,πα1
α2,A}be the inverse limit of the system {Xα,πα1
α2,A}of
Tychonoﬀ spaces Xα, and for every αlet any subset of Xαwith the boundedness property of
typePbe relatively compact. Then any B⊆Xwith the property Pis relatively compact.
Proof.LetB⊆Xhave the property P, then for every α∈A,πα(B) has the property
Pand, therefore, πα(B)Xαis compact. Obviously BX= lim
←{πα(B)Xα,πα1
α2,A}is compact
because it is a closed subset of a compact set.
The following result was proved by D. Preiss and P. Simon.
Proposition 5.2. (Theorem 5 in [17]) Let Xbe an Eberlein compactum, and let xbe a
non-isolated point of X. Then there exists a sequence {Un:n∈N}of open sets in X
which converges to x.
Lemma 5.3. LetXbe a regular space. Let f:X→Ybe a condensation and let the
closure of any pseudocompact A⊆Ybe an Eberlein compactum, then the closure of any
pseudocompact B⊆Xis an Eberlein compactum.
11Proof.LetBbe a pseudocompact subset of X. Sincef(B) is pseudocompact, A=f(B)
is an Eberlein compactum. Then f(B) is itself an Eberlein compactum, and is, moreover,
closed inY(see Theorem IV.5.4 in [5]).
Let us now prove that f|Bis a closed mapping (and, hence, a homeomorphism). Let
Cbe an arbitrary closed subset of B. SinceXis regular, there is a family γof open
sets inBsuch thatC=/intersectiontext{UB:U∈γ}. SinceUBis pseudocompact, the set f(UB)
is pseudocompact [11], and, hence, f(UB) is closed in Y. Therefore f(C) =f(/intersectiontext{UB:
U∈γ}) =/intersectiontext{f(UB) :U∈γ}is a closed set in Y. Thus, we have proved that f(B) is
an Eberlein compactum and f|Bis a homeomorphism. Hence, Bis closed and Bis an
Eberlein compactum.
Corollary 5.4. If a Tychonoﬀ space Xcontains a dense σ-countably pracompact sub-
space, and λis a family of subsets of Xcontaining all ﬁnite subsets of X, then every
pseudocompact subset of Cλ(X) is an Eberlein compactum.
Theorem 5.5. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ space. Let λbe a family containing all non-empty
ﬁnite subsets of X, such that it is closed under ﬁnite intersections and unions . LetPbe
a boundedness type property implying pseudocompactness su ch that for each A∈λany
subset of the space Cp(A)with the property P, is an Eberlein compactum. Then any subset
ofCλ(X)with the property Pis relatively compact provided that any subset of Cp(X)with
the property Pis relatively compact.
Proof.Lete:Xτλ→Xbe a natural condensation of a λf-leaderXτλofXontoX. By
Theorem 5.1 in [1], the map e#:Cλ(X)→Ce−1(λ)(Xτλ) is an embedding.
LetF⊆Cλ(X) have the property P. Denote by F1the closure of the set e#(F) in the
spaceCe−1(λ)(Xτλ). Let us prove that F1is compact.
By Theorem 5.2 in [1], Ce−1(λ)(Xτλ) is homeomorphic to the inverse limit of the system
S∗(X,λ,R), and the set πA(F1) has the property PinCλA(A) for every A∈λ. On the
other hand, CλA(A) condenses onto Cp(A). Therefore, by Lemma 5.3, the closure of the
setπA(F1) intoCλA(A) is compact. Hence, F1is compact as a closed subset of the inverse
limit of the system consisting of compact sets.
Note that the set Fhas the property Pin spaceCp(X) (which has a weaker topol-
ogy than the topology in Cλ(X)), and, by assumption, is relatively compact. There-
fore,e#(FCp(X)) is compact and closed in Cp(Xτλ). On the other hand, e#(FCp(X))⊆
e#(F)Cp(Xτλ)duetocontinuity e#([4],Corollary2.8.). Butthen e#(FCp(X)) =e#(F)Cp(Xτλ).
SinceF1⊆e#(F)Cp(Xτλ)=e#(FCp(X)),F1⊆e#(Cλ(X)) and, hence, F1is homeomor-
phic toFCλ(X)which implies that Fis relatively compact in Cλ(X).
Corollary 5.6. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ space and let λbe a cover of Xcontaining all
ﬁnite subsets of X. IfXis anAVγ-space or is functionally generated by a family γof all
of its subspaces that have a dense σ-countably pracompact subset and λ⊆γ, then each
pseudocompact subset in Cλ(X) is relatively compact.
12Proof.It suﬃces to refer to Theorems 5.5 and 3.5 of this paper and Theore m 1.1 in [3].
Corollary 5.7. LetXbe a Tychonoﬀ space and let λbe a cover of Xcontaining all ﬁnite
subsets ofX. IfXis anAVγ-space or functionally generated by a family γof all of its
subspaces that have a dense σ-pseudocompact subset, then each countably pracompact
subset inCλ(X) is relatively compact.
Proof.It suﬃces to refer to Theorems 5.5 and 3.6 of this paper and Theore m 8.3 in [3].
