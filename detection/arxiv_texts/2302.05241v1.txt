 ABSTRACT  
Chiral light sources realized in ultracompact device platforms are highly desirable for various 
applications. Among active media employed for t hin-film emission devices, lead -halide 
perovskites have been extensively studied for photoluminescence due to their exceptional 
properties. However, up to date, there have been no demonstrations of chiral electroluminescence 
with a substantial degree of ci rcular polarization (DCP), being critical for the development of 
practical devices. Here, we propose a new concept of chiral light sources based on a thin -film 
perovskite metacavity and experimentally demonstrate chiral electroluminescence with DCP 
approac hing 0.38. We design a metacavity created by a metal and a dielectric metasurface 
supporting photonic eigenstates with close -to-maximum chiral response. Chiral cavity modes 
facilitate asymmetric electroluminescence of pairs of left and right circularly pol arized waves 
propagating in the opposite oblique directions. The proposed ultracompact light sources are 
especially advantageous for many applications requiring chiral light beams of both helicities.  
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
Chirality ‚Äì non-equivalence to mirror images ‚Äì is optically manifested by different response to left 
circularly polarized (LCP) and right circularly polarized (RCP) light  (1‚Äì3). The basic chiral 
phenomena exhibited by natural materials are circular dichroism and polarization rotation which 
are both typically very weak. To overcome these limitations, various nanostructures, including 
three-dimensional chiral structures (e.g., plasmonic helices) and two -dimensional planar chiral 
structures (e.g., gammadions) have been extensively studied  (4‚Äì7). Strongly e nhanced chiral light‚Äì
matter interactions  in these nanostructures  can be utilized for important applications  (8‚Äì13). 
Particularly, ultracompact chiral  light sources  with a large degree of circular polarization (DCP) 
are highly desirable for display s, optical recording, optical communication,  bioimaging, and  
biomedical  diagnosis  (14‚Äì19). 
Thin-film light -emitting diodes (LEDs) ha ve emerged as a key technology for compact light 
sources  (20‚Äì22). Among thin -film LED materials, l ead halide perovskites have demonstrated 
remarkable properties , such as high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields, narrow emission 
width (or high color purity), and high charge -carrier mobility  (23‚Äì26). In addition, widely tunable 
bandgap energy makes perovskite materials ideal  for light sources in the visible spectral range. 
Recently, chiral light sources based on perovskite materials have attracted considerable attention 
to fully exploit their exceptional material properties. Extensive research has been conducted to 
obtain chi ral PL from perovskite materials  (27‚Äì35). For example, chiral perovskite materials can 
be created by incorporating chiral organic ligands on the surface of perovskite crystals  or 
intercalating chiral organic cations into the perovskite lattice  (27‚Äì29). How ever, achieving large 
DCP in such chiral perovskite materials at room temperature remains challenging. More 3 
 importantly , chiral electroluminescence (EL) with a large DCP, critical for compact device 
implementations, has not been demonstrated yet.  
Here, we propose, design, fabricate, and demonstrate experimentally a novel thin -film 
perovskite (CsPbBr 3) metacavity with DCP of chiral EL approaching 0.38 at room temperature, 
i.e., significantly larger than all previously reported cases  (36‚Äì38). Our design employs a layer of 
achiral  perovskite confined between metal and a metasurface created by an array of triangular 
silicon particles with broken inversion symmetry. C hiral Fabry ‚ÄìP√©rot modes  supported by the 
metacavity determine asymmetry of EL, an d pairs of LCP and RCP waves of equal powers  are 
generated in the opposite oblique directions. Our theoretical analysis and modeling reveal a crucial 
role of close -to-maximum chiral metamirror eigenstates underpinning the EL chirality. Our 
experimental res ults suggest employing such metacavities as ultracompact sources of chiral light.  
 
RESULTS  
 
Concept of thin film metacavity  
The purpose of the metacavity is to enhance EL from an active perovskite emission layer and to 
produce high chiral asymmetry, i.e., to support emission of either LCP or RCP waves in oblique 
directions. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the metacavity is created by stacking the perovskite emission 
layer between a metal mirror and a specifically designed metamirror. We omit the charg e transport 
interlayers in Fig. 1 A for clarity. Optical role of the metamirror is twofold: it performs as a semi -
transparent mirror supporting Fabry ‚ÄìP√©rot cavity modes emitting waves of one circular 
polarization; and it suppresses Fabry ‚ÄìP√©rot cavity modes of the opposite handedness emitting light 
of the opposite polarization. The key precondition for such peculiar functionality is the metamirror 
ability to selectively interact with circularly polarized waves. Various recent dielectric 
metasurfaces built as arrays of particles of high -refractive -index materials have repeatedly 
demonstrated that such selectivity can be achieved if their eigenstates are adjusted to the so -called 
maximum chirality  (39, 40). For the normal light incidence, this requires nontrivia l non -planar 
designs with variable height. For obliquely incident waves, simpler planar structures with broken 
inversion symmetry can perform in the extrinsic -chiral regime  (41). 
For a particular realization of the chiral cavity, we choose a square lattice of triangular 
polycrystalline silicon (poly -Si) particles, see the inset in  Fig. 1 A. With the dimensions properly 
adjusted ( L = 200 nm , tSi = 40 nm, P = 270 nm), they host photon ic eigenstates with a narrowband 
spectrum crossing the CsPbBr 3 emission band (wavelengths ~520 nm) as shown in Fig. 1 B. Apart 
from the close -to-normal directions, the eigenstate polarization is very close to ideal circular in a 
remarkably wide range of the  angles of incidence. This close -to-maximum chiral eigenstate 
together with the background metasurface reflection contributes to the formation of the metacavity 
resonance in the extrinsic -chiral regime  (see also Note 1). F or an oblique direction, the metacavity 4 
 can support a Fabry ‚ÄìP√©rot resonance and corresponding field enhancement inside  the cavity only 
for EL of one circular polarization. For the opposite oblique direction, the situation is reversed, 
and the EL of the opposite circular polarization is obtained.  Note that, in the directions not far from 
the normal, both metal and meta - mirrors flip circular polarizations upon reflection (discussed in 
more detail below), so that the cavity modes of the opposite handedness remain u ncoupled. In a 
more general context, the flipping makes the cavity qualitatively different from those built of pairs 
of helicity -preserving metamirrors  (42‚Äì44). 
The DCP of EL is defined by the intensities of emitted circularly polarized waves as œÅc =
 (IRCP‚àíILCP)(IRCP+ILCP) ‚ÅÑ  and it can be conveniently evaluated a ccording to the reciprocity 
principle . Indeed, the power and polarization in the far field of an ensemble of randomly positioned 
and oriented dipole sources can be obtained by solving the reciprocal problem for the incidence  of 
correspondingly polarized and directed plane waves and by evaluat ing the field intensity 
enhancement factors IRCP ,LCPincI0‚ÅÑ as integrals over all dipole positions (see Methods). Accordingly, 
we simulate RCP and LCP waves incident onto the meta -cavity at different angles, integrate the 
intensity of the electric fields in the perovskite emitting layer and obtain the enhancement factor 
for each angle. The colormaps in Fig. 1 C show the LCP and RCP intensity enhancement factors 
(cavity thickness d = 150 nm ). The colormaps are given in the axes of free -space light wavelength 
ùúÜ  and the in -plane wavevector component ùëòùë•ùëò0‚ÅÑ, where ùëò0=2ùúãùúÜ‚ÅÑ. The corresponding DCP 
colormap is also shown in Fig. 1 D. The shaded regions on all colormaps represent the CsPbBr 3 
emission band near a 520 nm wavelength and they nicely cover the range of the strongest EL 
chirality (maximum DCP). Therefore, efficient implementations of the meta -cavity concept 
require fine spectral adjustment of the metasurface eigenstates, cavity modes, and the emission 
band. In the following, we account the theory behind t he main design steps.  
 
Coupled -mode theory (CMT) of chiral metacavity  
CMT phenomenology describes resonant response of metasurfaces including those with intrinsic 
optical chirality  (39, 40, 44, 45). It can be generalized to account for the extrinsic chiral  effects as 
light is obliquely incident upon a metamirror with broken inversion symmetry (see Note 2 for 
details ). The corresponding co-polarized reflection and cross -polarized transmission coefficients 
read as:  
ùëüùëÖùëÖ=ùëüùêøùêø=ùë°ùëÖùêø=ùë°ùêøùëÖ=‚àíùëöùëÖùëöùêø
ùëñ(ùúî‚àíùúî0)‚àíùõæ0,                                            (1) 
while the cross -polarized reflection and co -polarized transmission coefficients are:  
ùëüùëÖùêø=ùúå‚àíùëöùêø2
ùëñ(ùúî‚àíùúî0)‚àíùõæ0,  ùëüùêøùëÖ=ùúå‚àíùëöùëÖ2
ùëñ(ùúî‚àíùúî0)‚àíùõæ0,                                    (2)  
ùë°ùëÖùëÖ=ùúè‚àíùëöùëÖ2
ùëñ(ùúî‚àíùúî0)‚àíùõæ0,  ùë°ùêøùêø=ùúè‚àíùëöùêø2
ùëñ(ùúî‚àíùúî0)‚àíùõæ0,                                     (3)  5 
 where ùëüùëñùëó and ùë°ùëñùëó indicate the reflection and transmission coefficients of the output polarization i 
from the input polarization j, respectively, and ùúè and ùúå are b ackground transmission and reflection 
coefficients. The resonant terms correspond to the excitation of a photonic eigenstate, and ùúî0 is 
its frequency, ùõæ0 is its decay rate, and ùëöùëÖ,ùêø are the parameters of the eigenstate coupling to RCP 
and LCP waves, respectively. For a known distribution of the eigenstate displacement current 
density ùêâ(ùê´), the coupling parameters are proportional to the overlap integrals  (39): 
ùëöùëÖ,ùêø‚àù‚à´ùêâ(ùê´)‚ãÖùêûùëÖ,ùêø ùëíùëñùê§‚àôùê´ ùëëùëâùëâ,                                              (4)  
where ùêûùëÖ,ùêø is the electric field unit vector  of an RCP or LCP wave and ùê§ is its wavevector .  
To decouple the state from RCP waves, it is sufficient to set ùëöùëÖ=0 which establishes the 
maximum extrinsic chirality . As seen from the diagram in Fig. 1 B, the meta -mirror eigenstate 
indeed closely approaches this condition in a wide range of the angles of incidence. To 
quantitatively analyze the underlying mechanism, we apply a multipole expansion to Eq. (4) and 
express it as (Note 3) : 
ùëöùëÖ,ùêø‚àù ùëÉùë•cosùúÉs‚àìùëñùëÉùë¶¬±ùëñùëòùë•
ùúîùëÄùëß‚àíùëòùë•
6[cosùúÉs(ùëÑùëßùëß‚àíùëÑùë•ùë•)¬±ùëñùëÑùë•ùë¶],              (5) 
where ùëÉùëñ, ùëÄùëñ, and ùëÑùëñùëó are the Cartesian components of the eigenstate electric dipole, magnetic 
dipole,  and electric quadrupole moments, respectively, and ùúÉs is the angle of incidence from the 
glass substrate . Numerically obtaining the eigenstate current distribution ùêâ(ùê´) we e valuate and 
compare the relative magnitudes and phases of the terms entering Eq. (5) in  Figs. 2 A and 2 B, 
correspondingly. One can see that the diagonal quadrupole components contribute negligibly, ùëñùëÉùë¶ 
and ùëñùëÄùëß contribute almost exactly in -phase with ùëÉùë•, while ùëñùëÑùë•ùë¶ contributes with a relative 
ùúã2‚ÅÑ phase shift. Therefore, the condition ùëöùëÖ=0 can be approached as a result of  the mutual 
compensation of the first three dipolar terms in Eq. (5).  
To quantify the degree of eigenstate coupling selectivity, we introduce the eigenstate circular 
dichroism defined as:  
ùê∂ùê∑ ùëö=|ùëöùêø|2‚àí|ùëöùëÖ|2
|ùëöùêø|2+|ùëöùëÖ|2 .                                                                    (6) 
Comparing its values obtained using Eqs. (4) and (5), as well as using the reduced multipole 
expansion accounting only for the main contributions ( Note 3 ), we find that the eigenstate indeed 
closely approaches the maximum  chirality, as its CD stays close to unity in a very broad range of 
the angles of incidence (see Fig. 2 C). Intriguingly, the multipolar content of the state varies with 
the angle. For smaller angles, the magnetic dipole contribution is almost negligible, a nd the 
chirality is provided by the interplay of the electric dipole components ùëÉùë• and ùëÉùë¶ which are shifted 
by ùúã2‚ÅÑ in phase. At larger angles, the magnetic dipole moment contributes more substantially, 
although both components of the electric dipole al so play similarly important roles.  
Knowing the metamirror characteristics, one can obtain analytical expressions for the fields 
inside the metacavity and evaluate the intensity enhancement factors. As both the metamirror and 6 
 the metal mirror reflect LCP/RC P light flipping its helicity and the metamirror transmits preserving 
the helicity, the cavity modes of opposite handedness remain uncoupled. The LCP and RCP 
enhancement factors are obtained from two independent problems (Note 2) as proportional to:  
ùêºLCPinc
ùêº0‚àù |ùë°ùêøùêø|2
|1‚àíùëüùëÖùêøùëümetal  ùëí2ùëñùëòùëßùëë|2,  ùêºRCPinc

|1‚àíùëüùêøùëÖùëümetal  ùëí2ùëñùëòùëßùëë|2,            (7) 
where ùëümetal  is the reflection coefficient of the metal mirror and ùëòùëß is the vertical wavevector  
component. One can readily employ Eq. (7) to explain the chiral asymmetry of field enhancement 
and, correspondingly, high DCP of EL. For example, for the exemplary wavelength and direction 
indicated by the black star in Figs. 1 B‚ÄìD, the transmission and reflection coefficients are given in 
fig. S8, where |ùë°ùêøùêø| has a resonance dip around 520 nm (therefore, |ùë°ùëÖùëÖ| > |ùë°ùêøùêø|). In addition, the 
phases of ùëüùëÖùêø and ùëüùêøùëÖ are significantly different, and thus the denominator in Eq. (7 ) also 
contributes to the field intensity and DCP. In general, depending on the cavity thickness d, a very 
different type of interplay between the resonant reflection (determined by ùëöùêø and ùëöùëÖ) and the 
broad background reflection (determined by ùúå) from the metamirror appears (see figs. S2 C and 
S3). This metacavity response can be utilized to optimize the emission intensity and DCP of chiral 
EL. 
 
Sample fabrication and reflectance measurements  
In our EL device , a square  lattice of poly -Si pattern s is integrated  with a perovskite EL device.  
Perovskite EL was measured on the transparent substrate side (fig. S5a). First, arrays of poly -Si 
patterns w ere created on a fused quartz substrate using electron -beam lithography. Each array has 
a different pattern shape (triangle or circle) and lattice period. figure S11 shows the optical 
microscopy and scanning electron microscopy images of the poly -Si patterns. On top of the poly -
Si patterns, a 60 -nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) layer was first deposited. Then, a hole transport 
layer and inorganic polycrystalline  perovskite emitter layer (CsPbBr 3) were spin -coated in 
succession  (46, 47). Finally, an electron transport layer and metal contact (LiF/Al) were 
sequentially deposited using a thermal evaporator. The measured cavity thickness was d ~ 150 nm. 
The top metal contact has a circular shape with 2 mm diameter and includes arrays of pol y-Si 
patterns underneath. Figure S12 A shows the PL and EL spectra from a reference sample without 
poly-Si patterns; CsPbBr 3 has an emission peak near 520 nm with a full width at half -maximum 
(FWHM) of 18 nm. The narrow emission width of perovskite material s can be advantageous 
because of the limited spectral bandwidth in chiral responses. Figure S12B shows the  absorbance 
spectrum of a bare CsPbBr 3 film spin -coated on a quartz substrate, and fig. S12C presents the 
refractive index of the poly-Si film measure d using ellipsometry.  
To experimentally characterize the chiral response of our device, we first measured the angle -
resolved reflectance spectrum using a custom -built Fourier -plane (or momentum -space) 
measurement setup ( fig. S14A). CP light was incident from the substrate side, and the total 7 
 reflection intensity was measured ( fig. S15). A clear chiral response appears in the cavity with the 
triangular pattern; the LCP and RCP reflectance maps show distinctly different mode dispersions 
near the em ission band (~520 nm). Using momentum -space tomography, we also constructed the 
cavity mode dispersion in the entire energy -momentum space (within the numerical aperture of a 
microscope objective) and further confirmed the chiral response of the metacavity  resonances ( fig. 
S16).  
 
Measurements of EL and PL  
To characterize the emission properties of our device, w e measured EL and PL spectra in the 
Fourier plane. The chiral responses of the thin -film cavities with the triangular and circular patterns 
were comp ared. The LCP and RCP emission spectra were measured using a quarter -waveplate and 
linear polarizer. Because the circular metal contact (diameter: 2 mm) includes arrays of the poly -
Si patterns underneath, a pinhole was placed in the real -space plane for th e EL measurements to 
collect emission from the patterned region only (60 Œºm √ó 60 Œºm in size for each array) ( fig. S14 B). 
The emission spectrum was then measured in the Fourier plane.  
We directly compare EL and PL spectra to characterize the emission proper ties of our device. 
Figure 3 presents the EL and PL DCP maps as a function of ùúÜ and ùëòùë•ùëò0‚ÅÑ. Because the DCP is the 
ratio of the RCP and LCP emission intensities, the DCP map becomes noisy outside of the emission 
band owing to small emission intensities. The upper row in Fig. 3 A shows the EL DCP maps from 
the triangular pattern for the periods of 250, 260, and 270 nm, respectively ( fig. S18 shows the 
separate RCP and LCP emission spectra for the 270 nm period). EL from the triangular pattern 
shows clear ch iral responses, which agrees with our reciprocity calculations in Fig. 1d. The chiral 
emission band gradually redshifts with the increase in the pattern period. The PL spectrum (the 
lower row in Fig. 3 A) also shows the same behavior. Figures 3C and 3D show the EL line spectra  
and the corresponding DCP at ùëòùë•ùëò0‚ÅÑ =‚àí0.27 and ùëòùë•ùëò0‚ÅÑ =+0.27 (period 270 nm), respectively.  
The EL spectrum shows a clear chiral response; the LCP EL intensity is larger for ùëòùë•<0 while 
the RCP EL intensity is larger for ùëòùë•>0. The peak DCP reaches œÅc‚âà0.38, which is the largest 
EL DCP in perovskite materials to our knowledge. In contrast,  EL and PL from  the circular pattern 
(diameter: 150 nm) do not show such a chiral response alon g the ùëòùë• direction (Fig. 3 B). 
We also conducted emission measurements over the (ùëòùë•,ùëòùë¶) plane (or Fourier plane) and 
obtained EL and PL images. Each point in the (ùëòùë•,ùëòùë¶) plane corresponds to a different far -field 
emission angle. Therefore, the EL and PL images in the Fourier plane indicate the far -field 
emission pattern from our device. Figure 4 A presents a comparison of the LCP and RCP 
components for the EL (upper row) and PL (lower row) from the thin -film metacavity with the 
triangular pattern. T he EL and PL images were measured using a 10 nm bandpass filter at 520 nm. 
In both EL and PL images, the LCP and RCP emissions are stronger for the negative kx and positive 
kx regions, respectively. This means that the LCP and RCP emissions are emitted int o opposite 8 
 angles. The angular plot  of EL along the ùëòùë• direction ( ùëòùë¶=0) confirms this behavior (Fig. 4 B). 
Figure 4 A also shows the corresponding DCP of the EL and PL. The DCP œÅ c in the (ùëòùë•,ùëòùë¶) plane 
exhibits clear chiral responses in both cases. All these emission measurements agree with the 
cavity mode properties determined from the momentum -space tomography (reflectance) 
measurements ( fig. S16). The angular plot of the LCP and RCP emissions o btained from the 
reciprocity calculation is also provided in Fig. 4 B; we find that the experiment (upper panel) and 
reciprocity calculation (lower panel) are in good agreement overall.  
We also note that the dark emission line (or suppressed emission) in EL  and PL images appears 
on the opposite side of the bright (or enhanced) emission along the ùëòùë• direction (Fig. 4 B), which 
increases the contrast between the LCP and RCP emissions. Because DCP is the ratio of the LCP 
and RCP emission intensities, DCP in ou r device is further enhanced by this suppressed emission. 
The observed suppressed emission agrees well with the reciprocity calculations in Fig. 1 C. Our 
experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that Fabry ‚ÄìP√©rot cavities with tailored mirror 
respons es can be exploited in a clever way to improve the characteristics of the chiral light sources.  
 
DISCUSSION  
Our approach is generally applicable to other thin -film LEDs with different emissive materials 
such as quantum dots  (20). In our concept and its realization, chiral EL with a substantial value of 
DCP is achieved from achiral emitters  without using spin injection or filters  (36, 38). We have 
experimentally confirmed that both EL and PL spectra show the same types of the chiral response 
being determined by the chiral behavior of the metacavity resonance . 
We have clarified theoretically that nearly maximum chirality  of the inversion -symmetry -
broken metamirror results from the interplay of the three dipole moments : two elect ric dipoles ( ùëÉùë• 
and ùëÉùë¶) and one magnetic dipole ( ùëÄùëß). In addition, we have explained the physical mechanism of 
the chirality asymmetry and the field enhancement in thin film metacavities, thus providing the 
general strategies for a design of compact EL devices that can enhance simultaneously chiral 
emission intensity and DCP.  
Thus, we have proposed and demonstrated experimentally a new type of light source  that 
exhibits chiral EL in a thin -film device platform. Many chiral applications require both LC P and 
RCP light of the same power (e.g., circular dichroism and enantiomer selection), and thus our 
studies provide novel opportunities for innovative device integration and applications  requiring 
ultracompact sources of chiral light.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Materials and perovskite synthesis  
Cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.999%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%) were purchased from 
Sigma -Aldrich. Lead bromide (PbBr 2, for perovskite precursors) was purchased from Tokyo 
Chemical Industry Co. Ltd., and 1,3,5 -tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol -2-yl) benzene (TPBi, 99.9%) 
was purchased from OSM. All the chemical materials were used as received without further 
purification. The precursor solution (0.2 M) for the CsPbBr 3 perovskite film was prepared by 
dissolving CsBr and  PbBr 2 (molar ratio, 1.7:1.0) in anhydrous DMSO under continuous stirring 
overnight at 60 ¬∞C. The perovskite precursor solution was filtered with a pore size of 0.20 ¬µm 
before use. The polycrystalline  perovskite films were obtained by spin -coating at 4000 rpm for 60 
s and the resulting films were annealed at 100 ¬∞C for 10 min.  
 
Fabrication of poly -Si patterns  
A polycrystalline silicon (poly -Si) film (thickness: 40 nm) was deposited on a fused (amorphous) 
quartz substrate using low -pressure chemical vapor de position (LPCVD) at 565 ‚ÑÉ, followed by 
annealing for 1 hr at 950 ‚ÑÉ. Arrays  of triangular and circular patterns were created in the poly -Si 
film using electron -beam lithography and dry etching. The side length  L of the triangular pattern 
is 20 0 nm  while the diameter of the circular pattern is 150 nm. The lattice period is varied from 
250 nm to 270 nm. The patterned arrays were first created on a PMMA resist ( AR-P 6200.09). The 
size of each array was 60 Œºm √ó 60 Œºm. After developing the patterned res ist, a Cr thin film was 
deposited as a hard mask for dry etching using an electron beam evaporator, followed by a lift -off 
process. The inductive ly coupled plasma reactive ion etching was then conducted using an Ar and 
Cl2 gas mixture as the main etchant t o create patterns in the poly -Si film. Finally, the Cr hard mask 
was removed using a Cr etchant purchased from Sigma -Aldrich.  
 
EL device fabrication  
To fabricate an EL device, a 60 -nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) film was first deposited on the 
patterned p oly-Si structure. The sample was then sequentially cleaned by ultrasonication in 
deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and dried in an oven overnight at 80 ¬∞C. The 
substrate was then treated with UV ozone for 30 min before spin -coating of poly(3, 4-
ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The PEDOT:PSS solution was 
spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 140 ¬∞C for 15 min. After spin -coating of the 
CsPbBr 3 film, TPBi (30 nm), LiF (1 nm), and Al (100 nm) were sequen tially deposited by thermal 
evaporation under high vacuum (< 10‚Äì6 Torr).  The thickness  and structural profile  of each layer 
were determined using  atomic force microscopy ( fig. S13).

The dispersion of the cavity modes in our device was measured in a custom -built Fourier -plane 
setup. To conduct angle -resolved reflectance measurements, the back focal plane of the 
microscope objective was imaged instead of the device sample surface. The s pectrum in the 
Fourier plane was measured using a monochromator slit as the line aperture in the Fourier plane 
(see the setup schematic in fig. S14). Both reflectance and luminescence measurements were 
performed from the quartz side. The in -plane wavevecto r kx is defined as k x = k 0sinŒ∏, where Œ∏ is 
the incidence angle along the x -axis. Note that refraction occurs at the quartz/air interface; thus, 
the internal and external angles are different in our case. Throughout this study, we used the 
external angles m easured in air.  
The chiral responses of the cavity modes were characterized using reflectance measurements. 
Collimated white light was circularly polarized using a broadband Glan Thompson linear polarizer 
and quarter waveplate and focused on the sample sur face using a high numerical aperture (NA) 
microscope objective (NA: 0.75). The total intensity of the reflected beam was then measured. The 
measured raw reflectance spectrum was normalized to the background reflectance of a flat silver 
film. For momentum -space tomography, the lens in front of the monochromator slit was gradually 
moved using a motorized microstage to construct the reflectance map in energy -momentum space.  
 
Measurements of luminescence spectra  
Angle -resolved luminescence spectrum measurements  were also conducted using the Fourier -
plane setup. The PL spectrum of the device was measured using a linearly  polarized diode laser at 
450 nm as an excitation light source. The circular polarization of PL and EL was measured using 
a linear polarizer and quarter waveplate. All measurements were conducted at room temperature. 
For the EL measurements, the bottom ITO  film was used as an anode and biased against the 
circular top metal contact. A continuous bias (4 ~ 4.5 V) was applied to measure EL. The EL from 
each pattern array (60 Œºm √ó 60 Œºm in size) was extracted using real -space filtering for spectral 
measurements . The emission DCP œÅ c is defined as the ratio between the RCP and LCP emission 
intensities (I RCP and I LCP, respectively): œÅ c = (I RCP ‚Äì ILCP)/(I RCP + ILCP). It is also related to the 
normalized Stokes parameter: œÅ c = S 3/S0. 
To obtain the Fourier -plane image s of EL and PL (Fig . 4), the monochromator slit was fully 
opened, and the monochromator grating was set to the zero position. The Fourier plane was directly 
imaged on a two -dimensional charge -coupled device (CCD) camera. The far -field emission profile 
of the device can be measured in the Fourier ( kx-ky) plane. The radius of the Fourier -plane image 
corresponds to the NA of the microscope objective. The EL and PL images were measured using 
a 10 nm bandpass filter at 520 nm. The bandpass filter covered the emi ssion band near the peak 
emission wavelength.  11 
  
 
Reciprocity calculation of circularly polarized emission  
The reciprocity principle states that the source and detector of electromagnetic fields can be 
interchanged without affecting the physical situation  (48). Therefore, the far -field radiation power 
and polarization from an ensemble of randomly positioned and oriented dipolar emitters can be 
obtained by simply calculating the field enhancements at the dipole positions under incident light  
(49, 50). The reciprocity principle ensures that the field enhancement calculation in the emission 
layer produces the same result as the dipole simulation . However, compared to typical dipole 
simulations, the reciprocity calculation simplifies emission simu lations and also enables a deeper 
understanding of the emission process in our device because the field enhancement in a photonic 
cavity is more straightforward to understand and optimize.  
The reciprocity principle states that, for any two current densitie s ùê£1,2, 
‚à´ùê£1‚àôùêÑ2ùëëùëâ=‚à´ùê£2‚àôùêÑ1ùëëùëâ      (8) 
where ùêÑ1,2 is the electric fields produced by ùê£1,2. For a dipole source pm, where ùê£ùëö=
‚àíùëñùúîùê©ùëöùõø(ùê´‚àíùê´ùëö) (m = 1, 2 ), this is simplified to  
ùê©1‚àôùêÑ2(ùê´1)=ùê©2‚àôùêÑ1(ùê´2)      (9) 
The DCP is then determined by  the intensity  enhancement  factors IRCP ,LCPincI0‚ÅÑ integrated across 
the perovskite emitting layer obtained by solving the reciprocal problem of illumination by 
reversely propagating incoming plane waves.  For circular polarizations, the reciprocal problem 
with interchanged sources and detectors involves waves of the same helicity45, but, additionally, 
interchanging obliquely incident and emitted waves implies reversing the in -plane wavevector 
component. In the considered geometry this is equivalent to the han dedness inversion, and, for 
simplicity, we preserve the in -plane wavevector component and evaluate DCP as œÅc =
 (ILCPinc‚àíIRCPinc)(ILCPinc+IRCPinc) ‚ÅÑ . 
 
Metamirror eigenstate analysis  
The complex eigenfrequencies and polarization current distributions of the metasurface eigenstates 
are numerically obtained using COMSOL Multiphysics eigenvalue solver. The corresponding 
overlap integrals Eq. (4) as well the multipole moments entering Eq. (5) are numerically evaluated. 
To analyze the eigenstate polarization, we calculate the integrals ùëöùõº=‚à´ùêΩùõº(ùíì)ùëíùëñùê§‚àôùê´ ùëëùëâ,  ùõº=
ùë•,ùë¶,ùëß, then extract the components of vector ùê¶ orthogonal to  k and consider them in the reference 
frame of obliquely inci dent wave as components of a Jones vector. The eigenstate coupling to 
RCP/LCP waves is described by ùëöùëÖ,ùêø=ùê¶‚àôùêûùëÖ,ùêø, where ùêûùëÖ,ùêø=(ùêûùë•‚Ä≤‚àìùëñùêûùë¶‚Ä≤)/‚àö2  is defined in the 
oblique Cartesian coordinate system ( ùë•‚Ä≤,ùë¶,ùëß‚Ä≤) with the ùëß‚Ä≤-axis directed along k. To visualize the 
eigenstate polarization in Fig. 1 B, we use ellipses as symbols and their shape and inclination 12 
 characterize the eigenstate polarization in a conventional way, while their size is inverse 
proportional to the eigenstate quality factor.
