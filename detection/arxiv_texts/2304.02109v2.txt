Gibbs samplers are preeminent Markov chain Monte Carlo algo rithms
used in computational physics and statistical computing. Y et, their most fun-
damental properties, such as relations between convergenc e characteristics of
their various versions, are not well understood.
In this paper we prove the solidarity principle of the spectr al gap for the
Gibbs sampler: if any of the random scan or d!deterministic scans has a spec-
tral gap then all of them have. Our methods rely on geometric i nterpretation
of the Gibbs samplers as alternating projection algorithms and analysis of
the rate of convergence in the von Neumann–Halperin method o f cyclic al-
ternating projections. As byproduct of our analysis, we als o establish that
deterministic scan Gibbs, despite being non-reversible, s hare many robust-
ness properties with reversible chains, including exponen tial inequalities and
Central Limit Theorems under the same conditions.
In addition, we provide a quantitative result: if the spectr al gap of the
random scan Gibbs sampler decays with dimension at a polynom ial rateβ,
then the rate is no worse than 2β+2for any deterministic scan.
1. Introduction. Gibbs samplers are Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorith ms
that stem from statistical mechanics. There, under the name of heat bath or Glauber dy-
namics, they were introduced to study discrete models, in pa rticular their phase transition
(Glauber (1963 )). Following Geman and Geman (1984 ) and Gelfand and Smith (1990 ) Gibbs
samplers enjoy tremendous popularity also in mainstream co mputational sciences. They are
used for sampling from intractable high-dimensional proba bility distributions πby itera-
tively sampling from the conditional distributions of πwhich for many modelling settings,
and commonly in the Bayesian paradigm, are more tractable.
The Gibbs samplers are often preferred over other approache s as they tend to be straight-
forward to implement and easy to use ( Smith and Roberts (1993 )). Choosing a scan strategy
– the order in which the individual coordinates of the d-dimensional πshall be updated from
their conditional distributions – is the key step in setting up a Gibbs sampler. Two com-
mon choices are the random scan Gibbs sampler (PRSG) and the deterministic scan Gibbs
sampler (PDSG). The former updates one randomly chosen coordinate at a tim e while the
latter updates the coordinates one-by-one in a determinist ic order. While choosing a particu-
lar scan does not represent a problem at the ﬁrst glance, and a ny ofPRSG or thed!possible
PDSG versions will result in a valid algorithm that has πas its invariant distribution, spe-
ciﬁc guidance on the choice is scarce. In fact, no scan strate gy is universally optimal, as

shown by Roberts and Rosenthal (2015 ) and He et al. (2016 ). Furthermore, the efﬁciency of
PRSGdepends non-trivially on the vector of selection probabili ties ( Roberts and Sahu (1997 );
Chimisov, Latuszynski and Roberts (2018 )). However, the theory of their fundamental prop-
erties that would usefully inform about the possible differ ences between scans is in short
supply.
The spectral gap property of Markov transition operators is central to Markov chain anal-
ysis and closely linked to convergence rates and other stabi lity characteristics of MCMC
(Meyn and Tweedie (2009 );Kontoyiannis and Meyn (2003 );Kipnis and Varadhan (1986 )).
With the aim of extending the current understanding of gener al state space Gibbs samplers,
in the present paper we offer a complete characterization of the spectral gap property for
different scan strategies by showing the following dichoto my:
THEOREM 1.1. LetPDSG andPRSG be Gibbs samplers targeting π. Then exactly one of
the following holds:
(i)None of the Gibbs samplers, PDSG’s orPRSG’s, have a positive L2(π)spectral gap;
(ii)All of the Gibbs samplers, PDSG’s andPRSG’s have a positive L2(π)spectral gap.
Hence, qualitatively, all the deterministic and random sca n Gibbs samplers are equally
good (see also Figure 1). We refer to this dichotomy as solidarity principle of the s pectral
gap. Moreover, since for reversible Markov chains spectral gap is equivalent to geometric
ergodicity (GE for short), Meyn and Tweedie (2009 ), the above result implies the following:
COROLLARY 1.2. Assume GE of any random scan Gibbs sampler targeting π. Then:
(i)all the Gibbs samplers, PDSG’s andPRSG’s, are geometrically ergodic;
(ii)all the Gibbs samplers, PDSG’s andPRSG’s, have a positive L2(π)spectral gap.
Proof of the above corollary is provided in Section 3right after the proof of Theorem 1.1.
However, to establish an analogous solidarity principle of GE for Gibbs samplers, one
would need to address the following open problem:
OPEN PROBLEM 1.3. Does GE of PDSG imply GE of PRSG?
Equivalently, one could also ask if GE of PDSG implies its spectral gap. The answer is
positive when PDSG is reversible, that is in dimension 2. Otherwise, it is a nontrivial issue
discussed in Section 5.
Main tools for our proof are provided in Section 3and Theorem 3.1. In particular, it im-
plies that despite PDSG being non-reversible, it satisﬁes an important condition e njoyed by
reversible operators: the existence of its spectral gap is e quivalent to /bardblPDSG−Π/bardbl<1. WeSOLIDARITY OF GIBBS SAMPLERS 3

explore this to establish that deterministic scan Gibbs sam plers enjoy many of the key er-
godic properties under the same minimal conditions as rando m scans and other reversible
chains: the Hoeffding inequality of Miasojedow (2014 ) holds for PDSG, as does the Central
Limit Theorem for functions merely in L2(π), see Theorem 4.1, with explicit bounds on the
asymptotic variance in terms of the spectral gap.
The rate of decay of the Markov operator spectral gap with dim ension is key to un-
derstanding how its computational efﬁciency scales with th e problem size. Rapid and tor-
pid mixing, which stand for the polynomial and exponential d ecay, respectively, have
been extensively studied for various algorithms in the sett ings from statistical physics
(Madras and Zheng (2003 );Bhatnagar and Randall (2004 )) and Bayesian posterior sampling
(Woodard, Schmidler and Huber (2009a ,b)). For the Gibbs samplers, there was a longstand-
ing conjecture (c.f. Diaconis (2013 );Levin, Peres and Wilmer (2009 )) that deterministic scan
was at most a constant factor slower and at most a logarithmic factor faster than random scan.
However, Roberts and Rosenthal (2015 ) and He et al. (2016 ) provided counterexamples for
both parts of this claim.
In this spirit, our Corollary 3.5provides quantitative estimates on the spectral gaps for
PDSG andPRSG in terms of geometry of the operators. The estimate for PRSG is sharp and
the result implies (via Corollary 3.6) that rapid mixing of PRSG implies rapid mixing of
PDSG. More precisely, if the polynomial rate of decay with dimens ion of the spectral gap of
PRSG isβ, than it is no worse than 2β+2forPDSG. This fact is illustrated by Figure 2. We
propose the opposite implication, that rapid mixing of PDSG implies rapid mixing of PRSG,
as Open Problem 3.7.
Our paper contributes to a vast body of related research. As t he speed of convergence of
MCMC is of major importance in theory and applications, the e fﬁciency of swap strategies
for the Gibbs samplers were studied in many contexts, howeve r, due to the difﬁculty of the
problem, usually under some simplifying assumptions. The r ates of convergence in the Gaus-
sian and approximately Gaussian case were studied in Amit (1991 );Amit and Grenander
(1991 );Roberts and Sahu (1997 ) and Chimisov, Latuszynski and Roberts (2018 ). Beyond
the Gaussian case, but for two-component samplers, Qin and Jones (2022 ) showed that
the deterministic scan converges faster in L2(π)than its random scan counterpart, no
matter the selection probabilities in the random scan, and p rovided a precise relation
between the two convergence rates. As shown by Roberts and Rosenthal (2015 ), such
a result can not hold when d >2. Further examples were given in He et al. (2016 )
where also the relation between random scans and convenient ly modiﬁed deterministic
scans was studied in discrete models and under further speci ﬁc assumptions. We refer to
Johnson, Jones and Neath (2013 ) and Tan, Jones and Hobert (2013 ) for conditions which
guarantee geometric ergodicity of all versions of two-comp onent Gibbs samplers simulta-
neously. A comparison of two dimensional sweep strategies i n terms of asymptotic variance
was carried out by Greenwood, McKeague and Wefelmeyer (1998 ) and further extended
inQin (2024 ). In such a case deterministic scan has always smaller asymp totic variance.
The topic was studied further for broader family of MCMC algo rithms in Andrieu (2016 );
Maire, Douc and Olsson (2014 );Andrieu et al. (2022 ). However, following the examples of
Roberts and Rosenthal (2015 ) and the discussion in Greenwood, McKeague and Wefelmeyer
(1998 ), these asymptotic variance results do not extend beyond d= 2. Let us note here4 I. CHLEBICKA, K. ŁATUSZY ´NSKI, B. MIASOJEDOW
that this is not surprising: in the study of L2(π)convergence reversibility plays the main
role, cf. Kontoyiannis and Meyn (2012 ). In the two-component case, the Gibbs samplers
PDSG=P1P2andPRSG=w1P1+w2P2are both reversible. This results from the fact
that for the projection operators P1,P2we have (P1P2)n= (P1P2P1)nwhereP1P2P1
is self-adjoint (and PRSG is always reversible in any dimension). Higher dimensional
PDSG, that we analyse in this paper, are not reversible anymore an d it is well known that
passing to multi-component samplers brings in surprising a nd counterintuitive phenomena
(Roberts and Rosenthal (2015 )).
Without assuming (approximate) normality of the target, or restricting to d= 2, re-
lations between the covariance structure and spectral prop erties of Gibbs samplers were
studied in Liu, Wong and Kong (1994 ), where it is also shown that PRSG is positive, i.e.
its spectrum is contained in [0,1]. Regarding qualitative properties, Proposition 3.2 of
Roberts and Rosenthal (1997 ) implies that if PDSG is uniformly ergodic, so is PRSG, see also
Proposition 4.8 of Łatuszy ´nski, Roberts and Rosenthal (2013 ) for a more direct argument.
Beyond the general abstract setting, GE of the Gibbs sampler s has been studied for
particular data models to establish reliability of Bayesia n statistical inference in vari-
ous statistical frameworks, e.g. by Hobert and Geyer (1998 );Johnson and Jones (2010 );
Jones and Hobert (2004 );Marchev and Hobert (2004 );Tan and Hobert (2009 ), for gen-
eral hierarchical models in Papaspiliopoulos and Roberts (2008 ) and, more recently, also
inZanella and Roberts (2021 );Papaspiliopoulos, Roberts and Zanella (2020 ) where esti-
mates for multilevel hierarchical Gaussian models are prov ided. In statistical physics, mix-
ing time for the Ising model was studied via the spectral theo ry since De Santis (2002 );
Martinelli, Sinclair and Weitz (2004 ). For more results on Glauber dynamics of spin glasses
we refer to later contributions Ben Arous and Jagannath (2018 );Eldan, Koehler and Zeitouni
(2022 );Gheissari and Jagannath (2019 );Jagannath (2019 ). We point out that the abovemen-
tioned contributions cover a wide class of problems, but the general theory still calls for a
uniﬁed approach.
Describing the Gibbs samplers in the terms of the orthogonal projection operators,
the approach that we here follow, was initiated by Amit (1991 ) who studied a particu-
lar case of convergence of Gibbs samplers for Gaussian targe ts based on the bounds due
toSmith, Solmon and Wagner (1977 ). On the other hand, the complete characterization
of theL2(π)-convergence rate of the two-dimensional Gibbs samplers wa s provided in
Diaconis, Khare and Saloff-Coste (2010 ). To establish the characterisation, Diaconis, Khare and Saloff-Coste
(2010 ) apply the classical results by Aronszajn (1950 ) on alternating projection algorithms.
Our methods rely on a more reﬁned application of the geometri c approach to the theory
of operators developed by Badea, Grivaux and Müller (2011 ) in order to analyze the rate
of convergence in the von Neumann–Halperin method of cyclic alternating projections. By
Proposition 4.6 in Badea, Grivaux and Müller (2011 ) their approach yields more precise es-
timates than those of Smith, Solmon and Wagner (1977 ) orDeutsch and Hundal (1997 ).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2we introduce notation and
background material on the the geometric approach. Section 3is devoted to the spectral
properties of the Gibbs samplers. In particular, we present there Theorem 3.1together with its
proof, followed by the proof of Theorem 1.1. Section 4provides additional results, including
the central limit theorem and the exponential inequality fo r thePDSG, while the discussion
of Open Problem 1.3is in Section 5.

Xn,−i:= (Xn,1,...,X n,i−1,Xn,i+1,...,X n,d),
and similarly X−i=X1×···×X i−1×Xi+1×···×X d. Let us consider a probability measure
onXwith a density πthat will be the target distribution. We denote a Hilbert spa ceL2(π)as

(1) Πf=π(f).

Gibbs sampler, the random scan Gibbs sampler is reversible.
Spectrum and Markov chains. BySpec(T)we mean a spectrum of a bounded linear
operatorT, that is a set of numbers λfor which (T−λI)is not invertible, cf. e.g. Rudin
(1987 ).
We refer to Meyn and Tweedie (2009 ) for basic information on Markov chains. For any
Markov kernel P(x,dy)we denote by Pthe associated linear operator which acts on func-
tions from L2(π), so that
Pf(x)=/integraldisplay
Xf(y)P(x,dy).
Throughout the paper we will assume that considered Markov c hains are π-irreducible. A
Markov chain (Xn)n≥0with transition kernel P(x,dy)and stationary distribution πis called
geometrically ergodic if there exists C(x)<∞and̺<1such that /bardblPn(x,·)−π(·)/bardblTV≤
C̺nholds for every nand a.ex∈X.
Note that since PΠ=ΠP=ΠandΠn=Πwe have the following fact.6 I. CHLEBICKA, K. ŁATUSZY ´NSKI, B. MIASOJEDOW
LEMMA 2.1. IfPis transition operator of a Markov chain with stationary dis tributionπ,
then for every nwe have
/bardblPn−Π/bardbl=/bardbl(P−Π)n/bardbl≤/bardblP−Π/bardbln.
We say that a Markov chain (Xn)n≥0with a transition operator Pand a stationary distri-
butionπhas a positive spectral gap (1−̺)if and only if
sup{|λ|:λ∈Spec(P−Π)}=̺<1,
whereSpec denotes the spectrum of operator (P−Π)inL2(π). Then the spectral radius
formula reads ̺=limsupn→∞/bardbl(P−Π)n/bardbl1
n, see ( Rudin ,1987 , Theorem 18.9). Therefore,
by Lemma 2.1, we have
̺=limsup
n→∞/bardblPn−Π/bardbl1
n.
In turn, a Markov chain has a spectral gap if and only if there e xistsn0such that
(5) /bardblPn0−Π/bardbl<1.
If in addition a Markov chain is reversible, then PandP−Πare self-adjoint operators and
for anynit holds that /bardblPn−Π/bardbl=/bardblP−Π/bardbln. So, in the reversible case ̺=/bardblP−Π/bardbl.
Geometry. Fori=1,...,d we deﬁne a subspace Mias subspace of functions f∈L2(π)
which are constant with respect to i-th coordinate. We denote by M:=/intersectiontextd
i=1Mi. Note that
Mcontains only constant functions.
It is easy to see that a small step Pi, from the deﬁnitions of the Gibbs samplers, is an
orthogonal projection on Mifor every i. Indeed, since operator Pi(x,·)is reversible with
respect to πsoPiis a self-adjoint operator and P2
i=Pi. Moreover, Πis an orthogonal
projection on M. We will use the following fact.
LEMMA 2.2 (Badea, Grivaux and Müller (2011 ), Lemma 4.2). Letf∈L2(π). Suppose
PDSG targeting πis given by (2)andΠis given by (1). Then for every j∈[1,d], we have
/bardblPj−1...P1f−Pj...P1f/bardbl2≤/bardblf−Πf/bardbl2−/bardblPDSGf−Πf/bardbl2.
In order to make use of some results of Badea, Grivaux and Müller (2011 ) we need
to recall some objects introduced therein. We deﬁne the gene ralized Friedrichs angle

In the case of two spaces this term was introduced in Friedrichs (1937 ). We point out that
the notion of angle between Banach spaces is still attractin g attention. See Oppenheim
(2018 ) for recent development. We also note that a quantity relate d toc(M1,...,M d), called
summation-based correlation coefﬁcient, was studied in th e context of telescope property
of spectral gap for Gibbs samplers by Qin and Wang (2024 ). Summation-based correlation
coefﬁcient is called a conﬁguration constant by Badea, Grivaux and Müller (2011 ) and they
show it is equivalent (up to scaling and translation) to the g eneralized Friedrichs angle, see
(Badea, Grivaux and Müller ,2011 , Proposition 3.6).SOLIDARITY OF GIBBS SAMPLERS 7

existence of the spectral gap for PDSG andPRSG.
THEOREM 3.1. For any stationary distribution πon a Polish space X=X1×···×X d
the following conditions are equivalent.
(i) There exist positive weights w1,...,w das in (4)such that the random scan Gibbs sampler

(iii) There exists a permutation σsuch that the deterministic scan Gibbs sampler PDSG=
Pσ(1)Pσ(2)···Pσ(d)has anL2(π)spectral gap.
(iv) For every permutation σthe deterministic scan Gibbs sampler PDSG=Pσ(1)Pσ(2)···Pσ(d)
has anL2(π)spectral gap.
(v) There exists a permutation σsuch that/vextenddouble/vextenddoublePσ(1)Pσ(2)···Pσ(d)−Π/vextenddouble/vextenddouble<1.
(vi) For every permutation σit holds that/vextenddouble/vextenddoublePσ(1)Pσ(2)···Pσ(d)−Π/vextenddouble/vextenddouble<1.
Conditions (v)and(vi)are in general stronger than (iii)and(iv), respectively. However,
we show that the reverse implication is also true. In additio n, since/bardblT∗T/bardbl=/bardblT2/bardblfor any
operatorT, conditions (v),(vi)are equivalent to
/vextenddouble/vextenddoublePσ(1)Pσ(2)···Pσ(d)Pσ(d−1)···Pσ(2)Pσ(1)−Π/vextenddouble/vextenddouble<1
for some permutation σ.
Let us note that conditions (v)and(vi)are used to obtain Hoeffding’s inequality for Markov
chains ( Miasojedow ,2014 ), see Theorem 4.2in Section 4.
In the proof of Theorem 3.1we employ the following lemmas.8 I. CHLEBICKA, K. ŁATUSZY ´NSKI, B. MIASOJEDOW

rem 4.1). By Lemma 2.2for every j∈[1,d]we can estimate
(dist(f,Mj))2=/bardblf−Pjf/bardbl2≤/bardblf−Pj...P1f/bardbl2

Therefore, since /bardblf−Πf/bardbl2=dist(f,M)by the very deﬁnition of ℓwe see that
ℓ2/bardblf−Πf/bardbl2≤/parenleftbigg
max
j∈[1,d]dist(f,Mj)/parenrightbigg2
≤d2(/bardblf−Πf/bardbl2−/bardblPDSGf−Πf/bardbl2).
Consequently, taking into account that /bardblf−Πf/bardbl2≤/bardblf/bardbl2, we get
/bardblPDSGf−Πf/bardbl2≤/parenleftbigg

/bardblf−Πf/bardbl2≤/parenleftbigg

Above, the order of projections does not matter, so we infer t hat for any permutation σof set
{1,...,d}we have ( 11).
Let us prove the equivalence of sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of the spectral gap
for both types of Gibbs samplers.
PROOF OF THEOREM 3.1. As the implications (ii)⇒(i),(iv)⇒(iii), and(vi)⇒(v)
are obvious, let us concentrate on the remaining ones. In thi s proof we denote ℓ:=
ℓ(M1,...,M d).
(i)⇒(ii)For any weights w1,...,w drandom scan Gibbs sampler is reversible. Hence,
the spectral gap property is equivalent to/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/summationtextd
i=1wiPi−Π/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble<1and(ii)results from

i=1Pi−Π/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble<1. On the other
hand, the assumptions of Proposition 2.3are satisﬁed and we have ( 8). Therefore
c(M1,...,M d)<1. Due to ( 9) we obtain that ℓ>0. By Lemma 3.4we have
/vextenddouble/vextenddoublePσ(1)Pσ(2)···Pσ(d)−Π/vextenddouble/vextenddouble</radicalbigg

and(vi)follows.
(vi)⇒(iv)We take any ﬁxed permutation σ. Then it holds that
/vextenddouble/vextenddoublePσ(1)Pσ(2)···Pσ(d)−Π/vextenddouble/vextenddouble<1
and(iv)results from ( 5).
(v)⇒(iii)It is a special case of (vi)⇒(iv).
(iii)⇒(i)Follows directly from ( Roberts and Rosenthal ,1997 , Proposition 3.2)
We are now in a position to infer our main result.10 I. CHLEBICKA, K. ŁATUSZY ´NSKI, B. MIASOJEDOW
PROOF OF THEOREM 1.1. We notice that the desired dichotomy is already shown in the
proof of Theorem 3.1. In fact, if any of the Gibbs samplers has a positive L2(π)spectral gap,
then property (i)or(iii)from Theorem 3.1holds true. Then, by (ii)and(iv), all of the Gibbs
samplers have a positive L2(π)spectral gap. Otherwise none of the Gibbs samplers has a
positiveL2(π)spectral gap.
PROOF OF COROLLARY 1.2. For any π-irreducible Markov chain the spectral gap prop-
erty implies GE, ( Kontoyiannis and Meyn ,2012 , Theorem 1.3). Moreover, for reversible
chains geometric ergodicity is equivalent to spectral gap p roperty, ( Roberts and Rosenthal ,
1997 , Theorem 2.1) or ( Kontoyiannis and Meyn ,2012 , Proposition 1.2). Since the random
scan Gibbs sampler is reversible, in the view of equivalent c onditions of Theorem 3.1we
infer that all Gibbs samplers have positive spectral gaps.
Using the proof of Theorem 3.1we can estimate the spectral gap of the Gibbs samplers.
Let us point out that the estimate for the random scan Gibbs sa mpler is sharp.
COROLLARY 3.5. Letc:=c(M1,...,M d)be given by (6). The following estimates on
the spectral gaps hold true.
(i)Ifα:=dmin1≤i≤dwi, for the random scan Gibbs sampler PRSG=/summationtextd

desired inequality.
Ifwi=1

To justify ( 13) it sufﬁces to note that by the very deﬁnition c=c(M1,...,M d)≥0.
(ii)Inequality ( 14) is a consequence of ( 11) combined with ( 9).
COROLLARY 3.6. In terms of the notion of rapid and torpid mixing ( Woodard, Schmidler and Huber ,
2009b ,a), if a random scan mixes rapidly, so does any deterministic s can. Equivalently, if a
deterministic scan mixes torpidly, so does any random scan.SOLIDARITY OF GIBBS SAMPLERS 11
PROOF . If a random scan mixes rapidly, its spectral gap 1−̺RSG(d)decays polynomially
with dimension d, that islimd→∞1−̺RSG(d)
d−β>0for some β >0. Therefore, for large enough
dwe have̺RSG(d)≤1−γd−βfor some γ >0. We pick such γ >0. Hence, by ( 8) we get
c(M1,...,M d)≤1−γd−β.
This together with ( 14) the above implies that
̺2
DSG(d)≤1−(d−1)2

16d−2β−2.
Hence
1−̺DSG(d)≥1
2(1−̺2
DSG(d))≥γ2
32d−2β−2,
which means that a deterministic scan also mixes rapidly.
We pose the question whether the reverse implication also ho lds true.
OPEN PROBLEM 3.7. Is it possible to prove that the decay of ̺RSG(d)is a polynomial
function of the dimension d, knowing that ̺DSG(d)decays with a polynomial rate with di-
mensiond?
4. Central Limit Theorem and Hoeffding inequality for Gibbs Samplers. As a direct
consequence of Theorem 3.1we prove that the following version of Central Limit Theorem
and Hoeffding inequality hold for both versions of Gibbs sam plers.
THEOREM 4.1. Let a Markov chain (Xn)n≥0with a stationary distribution πbe gen-
erated by the deterministic scan Gibbs sampler PDSG with a positive spectral gap or by the
random scan Gibbs sampler PRSGwith a positive spectral gap. Assume further that (Xn)n≥0
is Harris recurrent. Then for any function fwithπ(f2)<∞and any initial distriubtion we
have
1√n/bracketleftBiggn−1/summationdisplay
i=0(f(Xi)−πf)/bracketrightBigg
D→N(0,σ2(f)),
where asymptotic variance σ2(f)is bounded by
σ2(f)≤1+̺
1−̺π(f−πf)2,
with(1−̺)being the L2(π)spectral gap of the considered Gibbs sampler.
Moreover, for the random scan Gibbs sampler PRSG=/summationtextd
i=1wiPiwith any weights
w1,...,w dsatisfying (4)we have ̺=/bardblPRSG−Π/bardbl, whereas for the deterministic scan
Gibbs sampler PDSG=Pσ(1)Pσ(2)···Pσ(d)with any permutation σof set{1,...,d}we have
̺≤/bardblPDSG−Π/bardbl. In both cases, ̺andσ2(f)enjoy explicit bounds in terms of dimension d
and generalized Friedrichs angle c(M1,...,M d).
PROOF . LetPbe a transition operator for (Xn)n≥0. We will employ a general result
for geometrically ergodic Markov chains, i.e. ( Meyn and Tweedie ,2009 , Theorem 17.4.4).
By Theorem 3.1there exists ̺ <1such that /bardblP−Π/bardbl ≤̺and/bardblPi−Π/bardbl ≤̺i. We deﬁne
ˆf=/summationtext∞
i=0(Pif−Πf). By the triangle inequality we infer that

Moreover, ˆfsatisﬁes the so-called Poisson equation
ˆf−Pˆf=f−Πf .
Therefore, assumptions of ( Meyn and Tweedie ,2009 , Theorem 17.4.4) are veriﬁed and we
get that

i=0(f(Xi)−πf)/bracketrightBigg

i=1̺i/bracketrightBigg
=1+̺
1−̺π(f−πf)2.
The bounds for ̺forPRSG andPDSG result from ( 12) and ( 14), respectively.
Another consequence of our analysis and Theorem 3.1is that both versions of the Gibbs
sampler satisfy the following exponential inequality.
THEOREM 4.2. Let a Markov chain (Xn)n≥0and stationary distribution πbe generated
by the deterministic scan Gibbs sampler PDSG with a positive spectral gap or by the random
scan Gibbs sampler PRSG with a positive spectral gap. Let fbe a function valued in [0,1]
and denote µ:=π(f). Then for any εsuch that µ+ε≤1, anyn≥1, and any initial measure

with(1−̺)being the L2(π)-spectral gap of the considered Gibbs sampler.
Moreover, for the random scan Gibbs sampler PRSG=/summationtextd
i=1wiPiwith any weights
w1,...,w dsatisfying (4)we have ̺=/bardblPRSG−Π/bardbl, whereas for the deterministic scan
Gibbs sampler PDSG=Pσ(1)Pσ(2)···Pσ(d)with any permutation σof set{1,...,d}we
have̺≤ /bardblPDSG−Π/bardbl. In both cases, ̺enjoys an explicit bound in terms of dimension d
and generalized Friedrichs angle c(M1,...,M d).
PROOF . Combining Theorem 3.1with ( Miasojedow ,2014 , Theorem 1.1) we get required
inequality. The bounds for ̺forPRSG andPDSG result from ( 12) and ( 14), respectively.
5. On Open problem 1.3.In this section we present the conditions equivalent to the
positive answer to Open problem 1.3and give an example suggesting that the answer might
be negative.
REMARK 5.1. In order to show that from GE of PDSG the hypothesis of Theorem 1.1
follows it sufﬁces to prove that GE of PDSG implies GE of PRSG (or, equivalently, any of the
spectral gap properties from Theorem 3.1). GE ofPDSG is equivalent to each of the follow-
ing assertions, see ( Roberts and Rosenthal ,1997 , Proposition 2.1) and ( Meyn and Tweedie ,
2009 , Theorem 15.0.2).SOLIDARITY OF GIBBS SAMPLERS 13
(i)(exponential moment of return time) There exists some small measurable set Candτ–
return time to set C, andb>1such that supx∈CE(bτ|X0=x)<∞.
(ii)(drift condition) There exists a measurable function V≥1, a small set C,λ <1, and
K <∞, such that PDSGV(x)≤λV(x)+K1C(x).
(iii)(spectral gap in LV)For a measurable function V≥1and a space endowed with a
norm/bardblf/bardblLV:=supx∈X|f(x)|
V(x)the operator (PDSG−Π)has a spectral gap in LV.
A setCis called small if π(C)>0and there exist n, β >0, and a probability measure µ,
such that for every measurable set Awe havePn
DSG(x,A)≥1C(x)βµ(A).
Let us illustrate with an example why we suspect that it might not be possible to infer from
GE ofPDSG the existence of its positive spectral gap. Let us observe th at for a Markov chain
with a transition operator P, its spectral gap is positive if and only if its additive reve rsibi-
lization1
2(P+P∗)has a positive spectral gap. That can happen if the operator1
2(P+P∗)is
geometrically ergodic. In fact, we construct a Markov chain , such that PandP∗are geomet-
rically ergodic, but1
2(P+P∗)is not. Therefore, to obtain a possible positive answer to Op en
Problem 1.3, one must rely on very special properties of Gibbs samplers.
EXAMPLE 5.2. Let Z+={0,1,2,...}. Let us deﬁne the Markov chain {Xn}n≥0on
state space Z+×Z+by its transition matrix Pas follows
P((0,0),(n,n))=p(n)for alln∈Z+,
P((n,k),(n,k−1))=1 for alln∈Z+, k=2,...n,
P((n,1),(0,0))=1 for alln∈Z+,
P((k,l),(i,j))=0 otherwise ,
wherep(n)is arbitrarily chosen distribution with p(n)>0for allnand with ﬁnite expo-
nential moments. Clearly, Markov chain {Xn}n≥0is aperiodic and irreducible. We deﬁne
the stopping time τ=inf{n:n>0, Xn=(0,0)}. By ( Meyn and Tweedie ,2009 , Theorem
15.0.2) to establish GE it is enough to show that for some b >1we have an exponential
momentE(bτ|X0=(0,0))<∞. But if the chain starts at (0,0)the distribution of τis given
byP(τ=n)=p(n−1)forn≥1. Therefore from assumption on p(n)we get that the ex-
ponential moment of τis ﬁnite and further that the chain {Xn}n≥0is geometrically ergodic.
From ( Meyn and Tweedie ,2009 , Theorem 10.0.1) we deduce that the stationary distributio n
πis independent of the second variable. Hence the adjoint ope ratorP∗deﬁned by equation
π(k,l)P∗((k,l),(i,j))=π(i,j)P((i,j),(k,l))
is given by
P∗((0,0),(n,1))=p(n)for alln∈Z+,
P∗((n,k−1),(n,k))=1 for alln∈Z+, k=2,...n,
P∗((n,n),(0,0))=1 for alln∈Z+,
P∗((k,l),(i,j))=0 otherwise ,
The chain generated according to P∗, by analogous arguments, is also geometrically ergodic.
We will prove though that its additive reversibilisation K:=1
2(P+P∗)is not geometrically
ergodic. It sufﬁces to show that the conductance for this cha in is0, because then by Cheeger’s14 I. CHLEBICKA, K. ŁATUSZY ´NSKI, B. MIASOJEDOW
inequality ( Lawler and Sokal ,1988 , Theorem 2.1) we will get that chain does not have a spec-
tral gap. Consequently, by reversibility of K, we obtain that Kis not geometrically ergodic.
The conductance of Kis deﬁned as
κ:= inf
A:π(A)>0/summationtext
x∈Aπ(x)K(x,Ac)
π(A)π(Ac),
whereAcis the complement of A. For any n >0we deﬁne a set An={(n,k) :k=
1,...,n}. Observe that K((n,k),Ac
n) =0 fork=2,...,n−1andK((n,k),Ac
n) =1
2for
k∈{1,n}. Sinceπ(Ac
n)>π(0,0)>0andπ(n,k)=π(n,j)=δ, for some δ≥0we get

x∈Anπ(x)K(x,Ac
n)
π(An)π(Acn)≤δ
nδπ(0,0)=1
nπ(0,0)−−−→
n→∞0.
Sincencan be arbitrarily large, we infer that the conductance κ=0, and further chain Kis
not geometrically ergodic.
