ABSTRACT
Context. The centrifugal force is often omitted from simulations of stellar convection either for numerical reasons or because it
is assumed to be weak compared to the gravitational force. However, the centrifugal force might be an important factor in rapidly
rotating stars, such as solar analogs, due to its Ω2scaling, where Ωis the rotation rate of the star.
Aims. We study the e ffects of the centrifugal force in a set of 21 semi-global stellar dynamo simulations with varying rotation rates.
Included in the set are three control runs aimed at distinguishing the e ffects of the centrifugal force from the nonlinear evolution of
the solutions.
Methods. We solved the 3D magnetohydrodynamic equations with the P encil Codein a solar-like convective zone in a spherical
wedge setup with a 2 πazimuthal extent. The rotation rate and the amplitude of the centrifugal force were varied. We decomposed
the magnetic field into spherical harmonics and studied the migration of azimuthal dynamo waves (ADWs), the energy of di fferent
large-scale magnetic modes, and di fferential rotation.
Results. In the regime with the lowest rotation rates, Ω = 5−10Ω⊙, where Ω⊙is the rotation rate of the Sun, we see no marked
changes in either the di fferential rotation or the magnetic field properties. For intermediate rotation, Ω = 20−25Ω⊙, we identify
an increase in the di fferential rotation as a function of centrifugal force. The axisymmetric magnetic energy tends to decrease with
centrifugal force, while the non-axisymmetric one increases. The ADWs are also a ffected, especially in the propagation direction. In
the most rapidly rotating set with Ω = 30Ω⊙, these changes are more pronounced, and in one case the propagation direction of the
ADW changes from prograde to retrograde. The control runs suggest that the results are a consequence of the centrifugal force and
not due to the details of the initial conditions or the history of the run.
Conclusions. We find that the di fferential rotation and properties of the ADWs only change as a function of the centrifugal force when
rotation is rapid enough.

1. Introduction
Simulations of stellar convection, usually aimed at explaining
solar phenomena, often omit the centrifugal force. This is due to
the assumption that its amplitude is small due to the relatively
slow rotation of the Sun. Earlier in its history, however, the Sun
must have been rotating much more rapidly because, in general,
stars are born with larger angular momenta that are slowly re-
duced via magnetic braking (Skumanich 1972; Matt et al. 2012).
Therefore, the influence of the centrifugal force is expected to be
more important at earlier stages because its amplitude increases
as the square of the rotation rate. To study these phases of rapid
ration in the solar context, such as magnetic field evolution, one
has to study young solar analogs at earlier phases that are rotat-
ing much faster than the Sun (e.g., Lehtinen et al. 2016). This
allows us to study the evolution of the Sun up to the present,
given that outflows that are produced by magnetic braking do
not significantly a ffect the structure of the star, only the rotation
rate.
Observations by Lehtinen et al. (2016) of magnetic fields of
solar analogs reveal that they are active and show a character-
⋆e-mail: felipe.navarrete@hs.uni-hamburg.deistic split between the axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric spot
distributions. These authors also estimate that, among solar-like
stars with non-axisymmetric spot distribution, the active lon-
gitude periods are shorter than the rotation period of the star.
One plausible explanation is the presence of azimuthal dynamo
waves (ADWs). These waves propagate in the rotating frame of
reference of the star either in prograde or retrograde fashion with
a uniform frequency irrespective of the underlying fluid motions.
Such solutions were first discovered in linear mean-field dynamo
models (e.g., Krause & Rädler 1980). To explain their observa-
tions, Lehtinen et al. (2016) argue that the propagation of the
ADWs must be prograde.
V530 Per is an extreme case of a rapidly rotating Sun-like
star with an estimated rotation period of 0 .32 days (Cang et al.
2020), which corresponds to about 75 Ω⊙, where Ω⊙is the ro-
tation rate of the Sun. This makes the gravitational force at its
surface only 9.5 times larger than the centrifugal force. In com-
parison, in the Sun this ratio is 5 .3×104. There are also clear
differences between the magnetic field of V530 Per and the Sun.
For example, Cang et al. (2020) also find that the magnetic field
distribution of V530 Per is asymmetric with respect to the equa-
tor. It is characterized by a stronger magnetic field near the north

pole, with a peak field strength of 1 kG. It is as yet unclear why
similar stars have di fferent field strengths and symmetries, but
there are indications that rotation may play an important role in
the magnetic activity of Sun-like stars (Lehtinen et al. 2016) as
well as low-mass stars (e.g., Reiners et al. 2022).
Such rapid rotation is commonly found in close binaries
if tidal locking is assumed. For example, V471 Tau is a post-
common-envelope binary in which the secondary is a main-
sequence solar-like star with a mass of 0 .93M⊙, a radius of
0.96R⊙, and a binary period of about 0.5 days (e.g., Völschow
et al. 2016). If tidal locking is assumed, this gives a ratio of grav-
itation to centrifugal forces of about 22. Interestingly, Zaire et al.
(2022) analyzed the magnetic activity of the K2 star in V471 Tau
and find that the magnetic field is also dominated by a concentra-
tion on one hemisphere. They also find that the spot coverage and
brightness map, derived from Zeeman-Doppler imaging, do not
follow the magnetic activity cycle inferred from H αvariability.
This suggests that it might be inappropriate to use spot cover-
age to study magnetic cycles in rapidly rotating stars (Zaire et al.
2022).
Simulations of stellar dynamos often produce ADWs whose
characteristics change with the rotation rate and the physics in-
volved. Cole et al. (2014) studied the propagation properties of
ADWs in a set of three runs with moderate rotation rates of up to
6.7 times the solar value with 3D magnetohydrodynamic simula-
tions. They find that the waves have a rotation rate that is slower
than that of the gas, that is, they are retrograde. The magnetic
structure in the ADW propagates like a rigid body, and therefore
such motion cannot be explained by advection by the fluid in a
differentially rotating convection zone. This result was later con-
firmed by Viviani et al. (2018) with a larger set of runs. Most of
their runs show retrograde ADWs independently of the rotation
rate, but in some cases standing or prograde waves appeared. Re-
cently, Viviani & Käpylä (2021) presented a set of four runs with
moderate rotation rates where the usual prescribed radial depen-
dence of the radiative heat conductivity was replaced by the more
realistic Kramers opacity law (Brandenburg et al. 2000; Käpylä
et al. 2017). This suggests that using this heat conductivity might
affect the direction of the propagation of ADWs indirectly by af-
fecting the flow through the pressure gradient and /or dissipation.
However, it might come with the cost of pushing the transition
point of di fferential rotation profiles of simulations from anti-
solar profiles to solar-like profiles to even larger Coriolis num-
bers (Viviani & Käpylä 2021).
Navarrete et al. (2022b) explored the e ffect of the centrifu-
gal force in the context of changes in the internal structure of
the stars, with the aim to check whether the resulting changes
are su fficient to explain the observed eclipsing time variations in
post-common-envelope binaries, as proposed in the Applegate
scenario (Applegate 1992). In this paper we study the e ffects of
centrifugal force in semi-global dynamo simulations further. We
focus on di fferential rotation, magnetic energy, and ADW prop-
agation. In Sect. 2 we present the model and the implementation
of the centrifugal force. Section 3 presents the results, and our
conclusions are drawn in Sect. 4.
2. Model
We solved the fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic equa-
tions in a spherical grid with coordinates ( r,Θ,ϕ),where 0.7R⩽
r⩽Ris radius and Ris the radius of the star, π/12⩽Θ⩽11π/12
is the colatitude, and 0 ⩽ϕ <2πis the longitude. The model is
the same as in Käpylä et al. (2013) and Navarrete et al. (2020,2022a). The equations adopt the following forms:
∂A
∂t=u×B−ηµ0J, (1)

electric current density, ρis the mass density, pis the pressure, ν

2(ui;j−uj;i)−1
3δi j∇·u (5)
is the rate-of-strain tensor, where semicolons denote covariant
differentiation, Tis the temperature, and sis the specific en-
tropy. Furthermore, Frad=−K∇Tis the radiative flux, which
we modeled with the di ffusion approximation, where K=K(r)
has a fixed spatial profile (see Sect. 2.1 in Käpylä et al. 2014).
We also investigated the e ffects of Kramers opacity in some runs
(see Sect. 3.3). We did this by replacing the radiative heat con-
ductivity, K,in the radiative flux term Frad=−K∇Twith
K=K0 ρ
ρ0!−(a+1) T
T0!3−b
, (6)
where a=1 and b=−7/2 correspond to the Kramers opacity
law (Brandenburg et al. 2000). Here, K0is a constant that de-
pends on natural constants and, in simulations, on the luminosity
of the model (Viviani & Käpylä 2021). The FSGS=−χSGSρT∇s
is a sub-grid scale flux that we implemented to smooth grid-
scale fluctuations that would otherwise make the system unsta-
ble. Here,χSGSis the sub-grid scale entropy di ffusivity, and it
varies smoothly from 0 at r/R=0.7 to 0.4νatr/R=0.72; it
then smoothly increases by a factor of 12 .5 atr/R=0.98, above
which it is constant. The first three terms on the right-hand side
of Eq. (4),
Fgrav=−(GM/r2)ˆr, (7)
FCor=−2Ω0×u, (8)
Fcent=−cfΩ0×(Ω0×r), (9)
are the gravitational, Coriolis, and centrifugal forces.
2.1. Boundary and initial conditions
The magnetic field follows a perfect conductor condition at the
bottom of the convective zone and is radial at the surface. The
temperature gradient was kept fixed at the bottom, whereas at
the top we applied a black-body condition. For the entropy and
density, we assumed a vanishing first derivative at both latitu-
dinal boundaries. The latitudinal boundaries are stress-free and
perfectly conducting. The initial state is isentropic. Perturbations
were introduced by initializing the magnetic and velocity fields
with low-amplitude Gaussian white noise.

2.2. Centrifugal force
The parameter cfin Eq. (9) was introduced by Käpylä et al.
(2020) and controls the strength of the centrifugal force. A cf
value of 1 corresponds to the unaltered centrifugal force ampli-
tude, and cf=0 implies no centrifugal force. It is defined as
cf=Fcent
Fcent
0, (10)
with|Fcent
0|being the unaltered magnitude of the centrifugal
force. The necessity of controlling the centrifugal force is due
to the enhanced luminosity and rotation rate in simulations of
compressible stellar (magneto-)convection. Similarly to Käpylä
et al. (2020), each run was initialized with cf=0 and was in-
creased in small incremental steps after the saturated regime is
reached.
To get a sense of how strong the centrifugal force is in our
simulations, we computed the ratio of centrifugal to gravitational
forces in the simulations as well as in a real Sun-like star with
the same rotation rate. We defined the ratio between the two as
F=(|Fcent|/|Fgrav|)sim
(|Fcent|/|Fgrav|)⋆, (11)
where the subscripts ⋆denote the real star and “sim” the simu-
lations. These values are shown in the last column of Table. 1.
By using a value as low as cf=10−4, our simulations are in-
fluenced by the centrifugal force just below the value that the
equivalent star with the same rotation rate and radius would have,
and the simulations that have the strongest centrifugal force have
F=87.
3. Results
We ran a total of 21 simulations separated into five sets: C, D, E,
F, and G. Each set is characterized by a fixed rotation rate of 5,
10, 20, 25, and 30 times the solar rotation rate, respectively. We
varied the value of the centrifugal force within each set.
3.1. Differential rotation
We began by exploring changes in the di fferential rotation of the
simulations by defining
∆(60◦)
Ω=Ω(0◦,s)−Ω(60◦,s)
Ω(0,s)(12)
and
∆(r)
Ω=Ω(0◦,s)−Ω(0◦,b)
Ω(0◦,s)(13)
as measures of latitudinal and radial di fferential rotation. Here,
sandbindicate that the values are taken near the surface
(r=0.98R) and the bottom ( r=0.72R), respectively, and
Ω = Ω 0+uϕ/(rsinθ), where the overbars denote azimuthal av-
eraging, namely
uϕ=1
2πZ2π
0uϕ(r,θ,ϕ, t) dϕ. (14)
In what follows, additional time-averaging is denoted by ⟨·⟩t.

In the slowly rotating runs, sets C and D, there are changes
in both radial and latitudinal di fferential rotation, but they are
very small. Comparing the runs without the centrifugal force
with those with the largest value of cf, the biggest change in ∆(r)
Ω,
of about 20%, is in set D. However, larger deviations are found
in sets E, F, and G. They are also shown in Fig. 1 with the cor-
responding error bars, which were estimated by computing the
average of three equally long parts of the time series and taking
the largest deviation from the total as the error. In set E we see
that the di fferential rotation of the runs that were initialized with
the same cfbut at a di fferent time, namely E2 with E3 and E4
with E5, have very similar values. This shows that the averaged
differential rotation does not significantly depend on the initial
conditions when the centrifugal force is added. Within this set,
the maximum deviation of ∆(r)
Ωis about 23% between runs E1
and E5. In contrast, ∆(60◦)
Ωis reduced by about 17%.
Recently, Käpylä (2023) noted that the details of the radial
profile of Ωcan introduce spurious e ffects into the measure of
differential rotation as defined in Eq. (13). Following their ap-
proach, we defined the mean rotational profile at the equator as

where rin=0.72Randrout=0.98R. In Fig. 2 we plot this
quantity as a function of cf. The di fferential rotation is solar-like
(˜∆(r)
Ω>0), as already seen in the top panel of Fig. 1. This shows
that, if there are transients of anti-solar di fferential rotation in
our simulations, they are not very long and a similar scaling is
seen with both definitions.
As the rotation velocity increases more, the amplitude of the
latitudinal di fferential rotation decreases further in run F1. This
is a common feature of convection in rotating spherical shells
(see, e.g., Brown et al. 2008; Gastine et al. 2014; Viviani et al.
2018), which is also found in Cartesian coordinates with the
star-in-a-box setup (Käpylä 2021). In runs F2 and F3, ⟨∆(60)
Ω⟩tis
larger by a factor of about 2.3 and 2.6. Run F1 has bottom layers
that rotate slightly faster than the surface layers, as indicated by
the negative sign of ⟨∆(r)
Ω⟩t. The addition of the centrifugal force
changes this pattern back to a solar-like one, where the surface
layers rotate faster, although the overall di fferential rotation re-
mains weak.
We do not see major di fferences between runs G1 and G2,
and in G3 the latitudinal (radial) di fferential rotation increases
(decreases) by a factor of about 2 (10). Each of these runs has
⟨∆(60)
Ω⟩t>0 and⟨∆(r)
Ω⟩t<0. In run G4,⟨∆(60)
Ω⟩tis comparable to
that in F2, and, similarly, the radial di fferential rotation is shifted
back to a solar-like pattern. However, the amplitudes are all very
small and close to rigid rotation. In the control simulation (G5)
we took a snapshot from run G3 and switched o ffthe centrifugal
force; we obtained a solution that is nearly the same as in run
G1. This hints at the possibility that the e ffects we are seeing are
due to a systematic e ffect of the centrifugal force rather than a
chaotic behavior due to the change in the initial conditions.Overall, we find that changes in the di fferential rotation due
to the centrifugal force are only noticeable in the rapidly and
very rapidly rotating sets E, F, and G. We conclude that the
changes in both⟨∆(60)
Ω⟩tand⟨∆(r)
Ω⟩tare due to the centrifugal
force and are likely insensitive to the details of the initial con-
ditions taken from the parent runs. In a real star, the centrifugal
force would also change the geometry of the star. However, we
cannot assess the extent of this change because the fixed grid in
our model does not allow the geometry to change.
3.2. Magnetic energy
The magnetic energy of the first three azimuthal modes near the
surface are listed in Table 2 and shown as a function of the cen-
trifugal force amplitude in Fig. 3. It is defined as
Em=i
mag=1
2µ0*X
l≥mB2
l,m=i+
θϕt, (16)
where Bl,m=iare obtained from the spherical harmonic decom-
position. At slow rotation, sets C and D do not show signifi-
cant changes in the energy as the centrifugal force increases. At
the same time, we also see that in set C the axisymmetric mode
dominates the runs. This contrasts with the previous study of Vi-
viani et al. (2018), who find that, at rotation rates larger than
Ω/Ω⊙∼1.8, the m=1 mode dominates the runs, and after
Ω/Ω⊙∼20 the dominance falls back to m=0. However, at
higher grid resolutions, they find that this trend is suppressed
and so the m=1 mode dominated again. In the current simula-
tions, we find that this trend only starts to show up in set D. In
all cases, the m=2 mode is always subdominant by a factor of
roughly 10.
Similarly to the di fferential rotation, the e ffects of the cen-
trifugal force are more noticeable in sets E, F, and G. In this
rapidly rotating regime, the axisymmetric mode is always sub-

energy, and as the amplitude of the centrifugal force increases,
Em=0
magdecreases and so does Em=2
mag. We do not see noticeable dif-
ferences between runs E2 and E3, which have the same centrifu-
gal force but were initialized at di fferent times. This is also the
case for runs E4 and E5, meaning no hysteresis is observed and
the results are independent of the history of the run. In set F, we
see that the energy in the m=0 mode decreases, and in run F2them=2 mode carries most of the energy. However, when the
centrifugal force is increased further, the m=1 mode becomes
dominant once again.
In run G1 there is no clearly dominating mode, and the en-
ergy in the m=0 mode is only roughly 5% larger than in m=1.
As the centrifugal force is first added in run G2, the energy of the
m=0 mode increases by about 10%. However, similarly to run
F2, run G3 has most of the magnetic energy in the m=2 mode,

creasing the centrifugal force further, we see that the dominant
mode is m=1, same as in the case of run F3. When the centrifu-
gal force is switched o ff, the distribution of the energy goes back
to levels nearer to run G1 with cf=0.
3.3. Azimuthal dynamo waves
We began by estimating the period of the ADWs by building a
periodogram and identifying the signal with the greatest power
as the main cycle. We then investigated whether there are ten-
dencies between the period of the ADW and the rotation rate in
runs without the centrifugal force. This is shown in Fig. 4. From
Ω = 5Ω⊙toΩ = 20Ω⊙, the period of the ADWs of the m=1
andm=2 modes seems to increase with rotation. For more rapid
rotation, the period of the m=1 ADW decreases, whereas for
them=2 mode this tendency appears for Ω≥25Ω⊙. For the
two most rapidly rotating cases, the period of the m=2 ADW
exceeds that of the m=1 mode.
To explore the migration pattern of the ADW, we show in
Fig. 5 the m=1 mode of the radial magnetic field near the
surface at a latitude of 60◦for runs C1, C3, D1, D3, E1, and
E5, as well as the m=2 mode for runs F1, F2, G1, and G3.
Overplotted is the advection path due to di fferential rotation. In
Table 3 we list the periods of the ADWs at θ=60◦and the
direction of the propagation.
In runs C1 and C3 we obtain a retrograde migration with no
evidence of changes due to the centrifugal force. Both migration
patterns appear to be constant in time with no interruptions. Sim-
ilarly, the ADWs in runs D1 and D3 have a retrograde migration
pattern but are characterized by a longer period. Run E1 has an
interesting non-axisymmetric dynamo solution that shows peri-
ods of prograde and standing ADWs for the m=1 mode. The
migration of the ADW is changed by the centrifugal force, as
evidenced by the panel for run E5. This run has a retrograde mi-
gration, similarly to sets C and D, and shows no similarity to run
E1. As shown in Sect. 3.1, the change in the latitudinal di fferen-
tial rotation between runs E1 and E5 is about 17%. However, the
ADWs propagate almost like rigid structures, so di fferential rota-
tion cannot directly be used to explain their behavior. The precise
origin of ADWs is unclear even in the case where the centrifugal
force is absent, but quantities relevant for large-scale dynamos,
such as di fferential rotation, kinetic helicity, and other turbulent
quantities, along with their spatio-temporal profiles, likely play
roles. However, the changes we observe when the centrifugal
force is included suggest that subtle changes in the velocity field
are enough to significantly alter the behavior of ADWs.Table 3. Properties of the ADWs.

Notes. Data were taken at latitude θ=60◦for each run. The “greater
than” symbol indicates that the period of the ADW is not covered in
the simulated time. Asterisks denote a di fference between the period of
the ADW at the opposite latitude, and “ †′′denotes nearly equally strong
m=1 and m=2 signals. S, R, and P stand for standing, retrograde, and
prograde propagation. In the case of Run E1, a wave with a period of
about 80 years can also be identified.
In run F1 the wave is standing or very slowly migrating in a
retrograde direction. The migration period seems to decrease as
the centrifugal force is added in the lower panel of Fig. 6, where
the wave travels about 120◦in azimuth. Also evident here is the
increase in the magnitude of the m=2 mode at the southern
hemisphere. It also seems that this part contributes the most to
the change in magnetic energy seen in Fig. 3. It is only toward the
end of the simulations that the Bm=2
rat the northern hemisphere
catches up and becomes comparable in strength to the southern
hemisphere counterpart, as can be seen by comparing the panels
of run F2 in Figs. 5 and 6.
In the rapidly rotating regime, the m=2 mode of run G1
has a periodic wave with a period of about 26 years (see Ta-
ble 3), with clear prograde propagation. The centrifugal force
changes the propagation direction, as can be seen in the last panel
of Fig. 5 (run G3), and the period of the ADW is also a ffected
such that now it is about 70 years. In this case, the latitudinal
differential rotation is doubled in run G3 as compared to run G1.
Although this is the most obvious change between the simula-
tions, it is di fficult to explain the change in the ADWs with this
alone, as discussed above.
In general, we find a preference for retrograde propaga-
tion, as in Viviani et al. (2018). Interestingly, however, run E1
shows a combination of standing and prograde waves and G1
is prograde. A subsequent study by Viviani & Käpylä (2021),
where the prescribed heat conductivity was replaced by the
Kramers opacity law, showed that there is a tendency of pro-
ducing prograde-propagating ADWs. We replaced the fixed ra-
dial profile K(r) with the corresponding quantity from Kramers
opacity (see Eq. 6) and branched run E1 o ffto a new run, K1.

The centrifugal force was added in run K2 with cf=5×10−4.
Figure 7 shows the reconstructed m=1,2 modes for these two
runs. It is clear that run E1 is di fferent than K1, as the proper-
ties of the ADW are not reproduced when the Kramers opacity
is used. In the latter case, the ADW is prograde for both m=1
andm=2 modes, which also have comparable energies. This
is in accordance to Viviani & Käpylä (2021) in that it seems as
if prograde migration is favored when the Kramers opacity is
used. When the centrifugal force is added in run K2, the strength
of the first non-axisymmetric mode decreases down to around
1 kG, but the direction of the propagation appears to be unaf-
fected. Interestingly, the m=2 mode increases from about 4 kG
in run K1 to roughly 6 kG in run K2. The propagation pattern
is interesting in that it seems to oscillate around a mean azimuth
with an amplitude of 40◦between t=40 yr and t=110 yr.
After this, the strength of the m=2 (m=1) mode decreases
(increases), and at around t=150 yr the m=2 mode reappears
without a corresponding decrease in the m=1 mode. In contrast
to set E, the combination of Kramers opacity and the centrifugal
force produces a dominant m=2 mode, which was only found
in the more rapidly rotating runs F2 and G3.

4. Summary and conclusions
In this paper we have studied the e ffects of the centrifugal force
in semi-global dynamo simulations. It is important to assess its
effects in the context of young solar analogs, which are used to
study the Sun in an astrophysical context.
The amplitude of the centrifugal force is considered in our
setup as a free parameter and is thus decoupled from the Coriolis
term and the rotation of the star. In this way, its amplitude is
artificially reduced by the control parameter cf. This allows us
to avoid an unrealistically large centrifugal force (Käpylä et al.
2013). This approach was applied to a total of 21 simulations
divided into five sets, each characterized by a di fferent rotation
rate and with di fferent values of cfwithin each set. We find that
the centrifugal force induces changes in the di fferential rotation
and magnetic field only when rotation is rapid enough.
Both the latitudinal and radial di fferential rotation tend to in-
crease with increasing centrifugal force. In the two most rapidly
rotating runs without the centrifugal force, we obtained an anti-
solar radial di fferential rotation. After including the centrifugal

force, this solutions changed to solar-like di fferential rotation.
Namely, the outer layers of the convection zone went from ro-
tating more slowly to more rapidly relative to the deeper layers.
All of our runs have a solar-like latitudinal di fferential rotation,
where high latitudes rotate more slowly than the regions nearer
to the equator. This di fference increases as the centrifugal force
becomes stronger (see Fig. 1).
The magnetic energy, shown in Fig. 3, also shows noticeable
effects only when the rotation is rapid enough in sets E, F, and
G. All runs are dominated by the m=0 mode in set C and by
them=1 mode in set D, and they show small changes in energy
as a function of the centrifugal force amplitude. In the rapidly
rotating regime, it is common to find a dominating m=1 mode,
and the energy of the m=0 and m=2 modes decreases as cf
increases in set E. This trend is also present in sets F and G, with
the di fference that there are some cases where the m=2 mode
dominates.
By analyzing the ADWs near the surface of our runs, we
find that the direction of the propagation changes from prograde
to retrograde in some rapidly rotating runs as a function of the
centrifugal force. This is most easily seen in runs E5 and G3 in
Fig. 5. For run F2, we find that the direction of the propagation
of the ADW is not clearly a ffected, but there are indications that
its period might be a ffected (see Fig. 6).
To confirm the e ffects of the centrifugal force, we introduced
three control runs. First, in order to test the importance of the
initial conditions, we started run E3 (E5) with the same value of
cfas E2 (E4) from run E1 but at a di fferent time. There are neg-
ligible di fferences in the di fferential rotation, as can been seen in
columns 8 and 9 of Table 1 and in the overlapping points at con-
stant cfin Fig. 1. The magnetic energy is only slightly a ffected,
as seen in the third panel of Fig. 3 from the data points at con-
stant cf(Ω/Ω⊙)2. Secondly, it is important to look at the solution
of a run with the centrifugal force when it is turned o ffagain.
We did this experiment with run G3, in which the propagation of
the ADW was retrograde (see the last panel of Fig. 5). When the
centrifugal force was turned o ff, the propagation changed back
to prograde, as it was in the original run, G1. Overall, the control
runs show that the changes described above are due to the cen-
trifugal force and not likely the outcome of the nonlinear evolu-
tion of the equations.
A previous study by Viviani & Käpylä (2021) shows that the
propagation of the ADWs can be a ffected by the introduction of
the Kramers opacity instead of a fixed radial profile of heat con-
ductivity. We combined the Kramers opacity with the centrifugal
force in runs K1 and K2 and find that, first, the solution of the
ADW is di fferent for the runs without the centrifugal force (K1)
and with the centrifugal force (K2) as compared with the cor-
responding runs with the spatially fixed heat conductivity (set
E). Notably, run K2 showed a migration pattern that was not ob-
tained in any of the other runs (see Fig 7). This confirms that the
Kramers opacity changes the ADW solution, but it is even more
complex when the centrifugal force is included.
Despite our experiments, we were unable to identify the
mechanism responsible for changing the behavior of the ADWs.
The clearest change due to the centrifugal force is seen in the dif-
ferential rotation, but its e ffect must be indirect through the dy-
namo mechanism because advection by a shear flow is incompat-
ible with the practically rigidly propagating ADWs. The details
of the dynamo process in 3D simulations are highly complex
(e.g., Warnecke et al. 2021), and current mean-field methods are
applicable only in the axisymmetric case. Observations, specif-
ically an analysis of the surface magnetic field and its cycles as
a function of rotation, could help us better understand this. Sucha study was performed by Lehtinen et al. (2016), who find that
the photometric rotation period and activity period of a group of
stars show clear di fferences. They proposed that this trend could
be explained by the presence of prograde ADWs. However, our
simulations suggest that when a prograde wave is a ffected by the
centrifugal force, it changes to a retrograde propagation. Such a
discrepancy could be better understood by extending the obser-
vations and by performing more realistic simulations in a wider
parameter regime.
