Wecalculate electronic chargeandheattransportintubula rnanowiresgeneratedbyatemperature
gradient or a chemical potential bias. These nanowires corr espond to semiconductor core-shell
nanowires with insulating (undoped) core and conductive (d oped) shell, such that the conduction
takes place only in the shell. The cross section of such nanow ires is typically polygonal. We study
the inﬂuence of the cross section shape and shell thickness o n the electric and heat conduction of
the shell. We use the Landauer-B¨ uttiker approach to calcul ate the electric and heat currents as a
non-linear function of temperature and chemical potential bias beyond the linear regime.
I. INTRODUCTION
Nanowires made of diﬀerent materials allow several
controllable properties of the electronic states within
channels of widths from tens to hundreds of nanometers.
Such structures can be built as radial heterojunctions of
two diﬀerent semiconductor materials, and are known as
core-shell nanowires [1, 2]. Such nanostructures have a
variety of electronic properties, determined by the band
alignment between the two materials, by the size of the
core, orby the shell thickness orshape, which make them
attractiveforavarietyofapplicationsofquantumdevices
such as nanosensors, solar cells, optical detectors or ther-
moelectric convertors [3–6].
Core-shell nanowirebased on III-V semiconductorsare
almost always prismatic, with a polygonal proﬁle. The
typical cross section shape is hexagonal [7], although
other prismatic geometries such as square and triangu-
lar have also been fabricated [8, 9]. Interestingly, it is
also possible to remove the core, and to obtain hollow
nanowires, with vacuum inside [7]. Because of these
many possibilities, understanding the implications of the
geometry on electronic properties such as electric and
heat conductance is important.
In the present work we consider models of shells with
several geometries: cylindrical, hexagonal, square, and
triangular, with lateral thickness of up to 40% of the
overall diameter of the nanowire, and we calculate the
electric and heat current of electrons in the presence of
a temperature gradient and chemical potential bias. A
temperature gradient across a conducting material in-
duces an energy gradient which leads to charge or energy
transport. The particles on the hotter side have larger
kineticenergythan thoseatthecolderside, andtherefore
the net particle ﬂow is expected to be from the hotter to
the colder side. However, the thermoelectric current can
be positive or negative, depending on the type of carri-
ers, i.e. electrons or holes, or more generally, depending
on the occupation fraction of the transverse modes con-
tributing to the transport [10].
For a tubular nanowire with circular symmetry the
electrons have uniform angular distribution within the
shell. In the case of polygonal shells the localization pat-tern, especially for low-energy states, is much more com-
plicated [11, 12]. Consequently, the properties of polygo-
nal nanowires may diﬀer considerably from their circular
counterparts. In general, the lateral conﬁnement of elec-
trons in the tubular shell leads to an increase in thermo-
electric current compared to the values in the bulk ma-
terials [13]. At the same time the thermal conductivity
due to phonons can be strongly suppressed in nanowires
with a diameter below the phonon mean free path [6, 14].
Therefore semiconductor core-shell nanowires provide a
unique opportunity to design desired nanoscale devices
byengineeringthe chargeandheattransportrelatedonly
to electrons, throughthe crosssectionareaconﬁguration.
Depending on the purpose, suppressing heat and increas-
ing charge current, or vice versa, can be achieved via ge-
ometric elements [15, 16]. By considering electronic con-
ductancefeaturesandvariationsasfunction oftransverse
geometry and shell thickness, and the transported heat
through the core, one can calculate the ﬁgure of merit
or the thermoelectric eﬃciency, and ﬁnd optimal situa-
tions. Note that for this purpose the heat transported
by phonons and electron-phonon interaction must also
be considered [17, 18].
II. MODEL AND METHODS
Our model is a systems of electrons conﬁned in pris-
matic shell with cylindrical, hexagonal, square or trian-
gular cross section. In all cases we consider an external
radius of the polygonal shell of 50nm (i. e. the radius of
the circle encompassing the entire cross section), and ini-
tially the side thickness will be 20nm. The Hamiltonian
can be decomposed into a transverse term and a longi-
tudinal term. The transverse Hamiltonian is deﬁned on
a lattice of points that cover the cross section of shell.
For this purpose ﬁrst we deﬁne a radial lattice within a
circular disk on which we integrate the desired polygonal
shell and exclude from the Hamiltonian the lattice points
which are outside of the shell [19, 20]. The transverse ge-
ometry of our nanowire models is presented in Figure 1.
The discretized ring was represented by 10-15 radial ×
40-54 angular sites, depending on the polygon shape and2

We consider a ﬁxed chemical potential bias ∆ µ=
µL−µRand change the values of the chemical poten-
tials simultaneously, at each end of nanowire, in each
step. For studying the eﬀect of the cross section shape,
the values of the chemical potential at the left reservoir
start from 45meV, which is the minimum value corre-
sponding to the circular cross section, and goes up to
225meV, which is the highest energy level considered
in the triangular cross section. For studying thickness
eﬀects, the left reservoir chemical potential range will
be 140-850meV, for nanowires with thicknesses of 20nm
and 5nm. Because of the diﬀerent geometries, the en-
ergy spectra are diﬀerent. In each case we shall consider
the ﬁrst ten transverse modes to be inspected with the
chemical potential window.We consider a ﬁxed temperature gradient ∆ T=TL−
TR= 35K (which is veryclose kBTvalue) and wechange
both ends temperatures at the same time in each step.
In the ﬁrst step, TL= 36K and TR= 1K and simultane-
ously we increase each reservoir temperature by 35K in
each step. There are 12 steps for each of the charge and
heat currents in both cases of cross section and thickness
calculations. The energy integral is calculated numeri-
cally using the trapezoidal method.
We calculate the charge and heat currents IcandIq
by varying one parameter at a time. Note that we ne-
glect carriers interaction and scattering with impurities,
and consider only ballistic transport of electrons in the
nanowires. In this case the transmission function Tis
a multistep function of energy. The presence of disor-
der indeed changes the transmission function, but in the
present work we neglect disorder, or assume it is suﬃ-
ciently weak such that disorder eﬀects are dominated by
the thermal eﬀects.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Eﬀect of transverse geometry
In shells with polygonal cross section area, the lowest
energy states are localized along the corners, and there
is a considerable energy gap between the states localized
at corners and the next group of states localized on poly-
gon sides. This gap increases with decreasing the shell
thickness and with decreasing the number of corners[11].
However, experimentally, this localization eﬀect has not
been thoroughly investigated. Whereas for the electri-
cal conductance without a temperature bias, i. e. when
TL=TR, the conductance is expected to have steps cor-
responding to the transverse modes [20], the thermoelec-
tric and heat transport are diﬀerent. Figure 2presents
electrical and heat currents as function of left reservoir
chemical potential and temperature for diﬀerent cross
sectional shapes of our tubular nanowires. In Figure 2(a)
we can see that the electrical current increases with in-
creasing the chemical potential for all shapes, and that
is reaches larger values for the polygonal geometry than
for the circular case. Although for each cross section
the energy states are diﬀerent, the charge current in all
cases simply follow the transmission function and the en-
ergy window associated with the chemical potentials. By
increasing the chemical potentials more states will par-
ticipate in transmission which lead to a higher charge
current ﬂow. The largest electric current corresponds to
the triangular cross section. These values for electrical
conductance are obtained for all shapes without a tem-
perature bias, TL=TR= 200K, and as a function of
chemical potential bias. Another interesting issue about
electrical current variation with the chemical potential
fordiﬀerent crosssectionalshapes isthat in allcaseselec-
trical current will be saturated at high values of chemical
potentials.3

The heat current variation with increasing the chemi-
cal potential shows a peak for all shapes but we can also
see a rapid decrease after that peak, Figure 2(b). The
position of the peaks is related to the ﬁxed temperatures
of both ends, i.e. if we choose both temperatures 300K
instead of 200K these peak shift a little to the right side.
The reason for this shift is that when we increase the
temperature, kBTwill increase and the system needs a
higher chemical potential to activate the higher number
of carriers.
For calculating the temperature eﬀect on the electri-
cal conduction we change left and right reservoir tem-
peratures as mentioned in Section II. Now there is no
chemical potential bias in the system, and for each ge-
ometry the chemical potentials of the left and right reser-
voirs are considered equal, µL=µR= (µmax−µmin)/2.
For the circlular cross section µmax= 88meV and
µmin= 46meV, so we put both chemical potentials at
67meV. The same had been applied to the other shapes
and chemical potential values are 80meV, 130meV and
183meV, for the hexagon, square, and triangle, respec-
tively. In Figure 2(c), by increasing the temperature of
the left lead, the electric current initially increases, but
after reaching a maximum it decays slowly. The maxi-
mum values of the charge current for each shape occur at
diﬀerent temperature. The lowest peak occurs in the cir--1-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1

cular case, and the highest peak for the triangular geom-
etry. The highest value of the charge current for triangle
shape occurs at 250K, which is a quite high temperature
regime with respect to the other geometries. Also, the
charge current values at high temperature are nearly two
or three time larger than for other shapes. At low tem-
peratures the charge current for polygonal shapes with
fewer corners is lower, while by increasing the tempera-
ture we see the reverse situation, i. e. polygonal shapes
with fewer corners show higher charge current. The heat
current variation with the left temperature shows the
same behavior up to 100K for all shapes, but above that
temperature again the triangular case has the highest
current and the circular the lowest values for the trans-
ported heat. Just like the electric current, heat current
has a peak occurring diﬀerent temperatures for diﬀer-
ent cross sectional shapes, and after that it decreases
smoothly to a saturated value.
B. Eﬀect of thickness
Next we shall consider the triangular cross sectional
shape for studying the thickness eﬀect on the electronic
charge and heat transport. The working samples will
have a ﬁxed external radius and variable side thickness.
The energy levels strongly depend on the aspect of ratio
of the polygonal cross section, i. e. the ratio of thick-
ness to diameter, in a way that the energy diﬀerences
increase when this ratio is small. In particular, for the
triangular case the energy gap between states localized
at corners and states localized on sides strongly increases
with decreasing the side thickness and keeping the total
thickness ﬁxed [12]. An example is shown in Figure 3.
In the next calculations we shall use four shell thick-
nesses, 5, 10, 15, and 20nm and constant external radii
50nm. Similar to the calculations for variable geometry,
in this part we consider TL=TR= 200K in case of a
chemical potential bias. And for a temperature bias we
consider left and right chemical potentials as average of4

speciﬁc thickness.
In Figure 4we present values of the charge and heat
currents for diﬀerent thickness of the equilateral trian-
gular shell while increasing the left chemical potential
and temperature. The higher chemical potential leads
more states to participate in transmission and the elec-
tric current increase, and this is clearly observable in in
Figure4(a) regardless of thickness of sample. But this
increase is diﬀerent for each thickness, and from a step
like behavior for the 5nm shell it evolves to an almost
linear function. An equation to describe analytically this
I-V characteristicsis howeverbeyond the intention ofour
present study. For thinner shells with respect to the di-
ameterofnanowires,cornerlocalizationcausemoreeﬀecton electrons distribution. And for thin shells the energy
gap between the corner and side states are higher. Due
to this reason step like behavior was expected from thin-
ner shell and by increasing shell thickness this step like
behavior vanish gradually. We can expect these step like
behaviorfor othergeometriesif we decreasethe thickness
of shell below 10nm.
Fig.4(b) shows the variation of the heat current with
increasing the left chemical potential, with one or two
maxima for each thickness. The energy interval between
maxima is related to the energy gap between corner and
side states. Fig. 4(c) shows that the thermoelectric cur-
rent increases with increasing the shell thickness, with
an almost linear variation with the temperature bias for
the smallestthicknesses, and awith amaximum point for
the largest thickness. Finally, in Fig. 4(d) we can also see
a linear behavior of the heat current for 5nm thickness,
and a non-linear characteristic with a maximum current
developing for the other cases. Interestingly, the relative
magnitude of the these heat currents reverses between
low and high temperatures.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we reported computed features of charge
and heat transport in core-shell nanowires when the elec-
tronic transport occurs within the shell. These features
were studied for diﬀerent cross sectional geometries of
the shell. The charge and heat conductivity, as functions
with respect to the chemical potential and temperature
biases, depend signiﬁcantly on the geometry. Shells with
triangular cross section lead to larger charge and heat
currents in the presence of a temperature gradient, but
not in the case of a chemical potential bias. Also, the
charge and heat currents were found to change substan-
tially with decreasing shell thickness, due to the increas-
ing of the gap between corner and side states.
