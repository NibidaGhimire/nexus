1 INTRODUCTION
Sincethefirstbinaryblackholemergerobservationsdetectedbythe
LIGO-Virgo collaboration (Abbott et al. 2016), a new window has
been opened in astrophysics in the gravitational wave (GW) field
(Barack et al. 2019). In 2017, for the first time, the GW signal from
a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, named GW170817, was also
detected (Abbott et al. 2017a) and it was accompanied by electro-
magnetic (EM) counterpart observations from gamma rays to radio
(Abbottetal.2017b).Thus,themulti-messengererahasbegun.Two
years after the first detection of a BNS merger, GW190425, a new
BNS system, was detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration (Ab-
bott & et al. 2020). For the latter, there is however no detected EM
counterpart. GW190425 observation is significant due to being the
heaviest BNS system ever observed, with a total mass ( 3.4+0.3
−0.1𝑀⊙
assumption of high-spin prior) much larger than the one measured
forthegalacticBNSsystemstodate(Farrowetal.2019;Zhangetal.
2019).
The possible outcomes of a BNS merger can be either a prompt
collapse to a black hole (BH), or the formation of a short-lived
★E-mail: kutay.arinc.cokluk@ege.edu.trhypermassiveneutronstar(HMNS)orlong-livedsupermassiveneu-
tron star (SMNS) that eventually collapses to a BH, or a stable NS
(Piroetal.2017).Ifthetotalgravitationalmassofthesystem, 𝑀,is
higher than a threshold mass, 𝑀thres(e.g., (Hotokezaka et al. 2011;
Bausweinetal.2013;Köppeletal.2019;Baracketal.2019;Kashyap
etal.2022;Peregoetal.2022)),thentheremnantofthemergerwill
promptly collapse to a BH. Although from the galactic population
of BNSs the masses of NSs in BNS systems are expected to lie in
a range 1.3−1.4𝑀⊙, studies (Paschalidis & Ruiz 2019; Margalit &
Metzger2019)suggest,respectively,thatupto25%and32%ofBNS
mergersmightproducearapidcollapsetoBH.ForGW190425,itis
estimatedthatthe probabilityofthebinary promptlycollapsinginto
a BH after the merger is 96% , with the low-spin prior, or 97% with
the high-spin prior (Abbott & et al. 2020).

High-mass mergers, such as the ones discussed in this study, are
important to study because they can provide insight into high-mass
neutron stars and the remnants produced by their mergers. We can
also learn about the internal structure of massive neutron stars (e.g.,
their EOS) by analyzing these types of mergers. We conducted sim-
ulations of high-mass binary systems that underwent rapid collapse
in this study, and we investigated the effects of mass ratio and to-
tal mass on gravitational wave emission and system dynamics. The
paper is organized as follows: we review the numerical setup and
initial data for our models in Section 2. The numerical results are

initial data using the pseudo spectral elliptic solver LORENE(Gour-
goulhon et al. 2001; Gourgoulhon et al. 2016) assuming irrotational
NSs on a quasi-circular orbit. For all models, the initial coordinate
separation is 40𝑘𝑚, corresponding to≈3orbits before the merger.
We report the initial parameters of our models in Table 1. The first
columnreferstothenamesofthemodels,e.g. M32q10meansthatthe
initialtotalbaryonicmassoftheBNSis 3.2𝑀⊙andthatthemassratio

The notation(1→2)indicates a second term identical to the first,
but 1 and 2 are exchanged.
This work employs the SLy EOS (Douchin & Haensel 2001) to
describe the NS matter. To build the initial data, we used the EOS
table provided by Parma Gravity Group1. During the evolution, we
instead used the seven piece polytropic version (SLyPP) described
in De Pietri et al. (2016) and added a thermal component given by
Γthermal=1.8.
To solve the general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) equa-
tions, we used the publicly available Einstein Toolkit (ET)
(Etienne et al. 2021; Löffler et al. 2012) code, based on Cactus
Computational Toolkit2. In particular, we used the nineteenth
release version of ET named “Katherine Johnson” (ET_2021_11)
(Brandt et al. 2021).
We evolve the space-time metric using the BSSN formalism
(Nakamura et al. 1987; Shibata & Nakamura 1995; Baumgarte &
Shapiro 1998; Alcubierre et al. 2000, 2003) as implemented in the
McLachlan thorn3. We use the GRHydro code (Baiotti et al. 2005;
Hawke et al. 2005; Mösta et al. 2013) to solve the GRHD equations

Note that results presented in this paper are extracted from the
simulations having the standard resolution (SR) of 𝑑𝑥=0.16. For

ForallofourGWanalysis,thecomplexcombinationoftheextracted
GW amplitude polarizations, ℎ=ℎ+−𝑖ℎ×, is used, and only the
dominant mode, i.e. 𝑙=𝑚=2, is considered. Note that the ℎ22
mode we extracted from the simulation is the amplitude of the (2,2)
mode without the spherical harmonics term. Therefore it does not
take into account the effect of the viewing angle. We also plot the
waveform as a function of retarded time (Eq. 4), where the areal

versionofthe KuibitPythonlibrary(Bozzola2021).Verticaldottedlinescorrespondtothemergerfrequenciesestimatedfromtheinstantaneousfrequencyat

(left) and unequal (right) mass models are shown in Figure 1. Grav-
itational waveforms include the last part of inspiral, approximately
threeorbitsbeforemerger,andthecoalescenceandringdownstages
for all models. Models with larger total mass show, as expected,
higher GW amplitudes at merger, while models with higher mass
ratios have smaller amplitudes.
Because of the prompt formation of a BH, all GW signals go to
zero less than≈2ms after the merger. The frequency evolution for
allmodelsisshowninthebottompanels.Beforethemergerstage,the
frequencies are nearly identical for all models and increase mono-
tonically with GW amplitude in time. Except for high mass ratio
models, the frequency increases after merger due to increased com-
pactness and faster rotation of the remnant, as explained in Endrizzi
et al. (2016) and Kastaun et al. (2016). They behave differently for
the latter in that, while model M32q20oscillates around 1𝑘𝐻𝑧, the
frequenciesoftheothermodelsrapidlyincreaseshortlybefore 1𝑚𝑠.
We then compute the amplitude spectral density (ASD) as

and unequal (right panel) models placed at a distance of 50𝑀𝑝𝑐
and the sensitivity curves of current (aLIGO+, KAGRA) and future
planned (Einstein Telescope, Voyager, Cosmic Explorer) detectors.
The initial frequency peak at around 1000𝐻𝑧is equal to double of
the initial orbital frequency of each model, and it just indicates the
beginningoftheinspiralstagesinoursimulations.FromFigure2we
cansee thatall systemscanbe observedin theirmergerphase byall
detectors but KAGRA (which would be able to see only the earlier
part of the inspiral, not simulated here).
Besides,weobserveplateausbetween 4000−7000𝐻𝑧forallmod-
els,but M38q10andM40q10whicharethosethatformaBHearlier.
Fortheunequal-massmodels,thefrequencyofplateauschangeswith
the mass ratio and is more evident for larger mass ratios. Moreover,
we realise that frequencies of plateaus show a turning point. Whilea more noticeable plateau is observed in models with higher mass
ratios, the clarity decreases as we move towards models with equal
mass. Moreover, plateaus are observed at higher frequencies and
higherASDvaluesasthemassratiosdecrease,whiletheASDvalue
decreases after 𝑞=1.0−1.2. This suggests that there is a turning
point in this mass ratio range. In Kiuchi et al. (2010) it is suggested
that plateaus at high frequencies are related to both the formations
and evolution of black holes and their surrounding disks. Therefore,
we compare the ASD of model M30q10, which shows delayed col-
lapseintoaBHsurroundedbytorusafterashort-livedHMNSphase,
and prompt collapse models with torus (e.g. M32q10) and without
torus(e.g. M34q10, M36q10 ).Werealisethatthoseplateausareonly
related to the case of prompt collapse models regardless of having a
torus or not.

According to Kiuchi et al. (2010), the peak frequency and width
of the plateau show a correlation with the disk mass. Thus, these
plateausprovideuswithinformationabouttheformationandevolu-
tion of matter around the central object. If the frequency increases,
weobserveadecreaseintheamplitudespectraldensity,asexpected,

aBH.AssuggestedinShibataetal.(2003)andShibata&Taniguchi
(2006), nearly all the matter tends to fall into the BH in the prompt
collapse scenario. Moreover, it is realised that the elapsed time for
the formation of a BH changes in a parabolic way with the increase
ofthe massratio.When themass ratioisbetween 𝑞=1.0−1.4,the
required time to form a BH increases, but after 𝑞=1.4, it starts to
decrease.

future simulations using similar equations of state.
In Fig. 3, we show how the values extracted from our simulations
change with initial binary neutron star system mass (left panels)
and mass ratio (right panels). From the left panels in the figure, it
can be seen that the dimensionless spin (mass) of the BH decreases
(increases) with increasing BNS mass. When increasing the BNS
mass, also the disk mass and the amount of ejected matter from
the system decrease. Energy radiated via GW is also increasing for
higher mass binary neutron star systems. From these plots, we can
estimatethat,inthepromptcollapsecase,theBHswallows 98−99%

In Fig. 4, we present the evolution of the rest mass density for the

The columns indicate times, while the rows refer to the models. All
models are inspiralling and losing matter from the tidal tails due
to tidal emission 3𝑚𝑠before the merger (first column in Fig. 4).
At𝑡=0.00𝑚𝑠(second column in Fig. 4), the cores of the two

3.4 Comparison of Our Results with Other Works
In the study of Kölsch et al. (2022), the authors used the BAM
code to simulate models with three different resolutions: 𝑑𝑥=
0.13,0.16,0.21, which are closer to the resolutions we used in
this study. The models employing the SLy EOS and a gravitational
mass of𝑀=2.90𝑀⊙at different mass ratios ( 𝑞=1.0,1.25
and1.50) evolved in Kölsch et al. (2022) are close to our models
M32q10(𝑀=2.88, 𝑞=1.0),M32q13(𝑀=2.88, 𝑞=1.26),
andM32q16(𝑀=2.88, 𝑞=1.52). We compared the time for
the formation of the BH after the merger, the BH mass, the BH
dimensionless spin, and disk mass. For the models very similar
to the M32q10,M32q13andM32q16, they reported respectively,
𝑀𝐵𝐻=2.831,∼2.784,∼2.741𝑀⊙,𝜒=0.768,∼0.717,∼0.657
and𝑀disk=5.6×10−4,∼5.346×10−2,∼1.145×10−1𝑀⊙. Be-
sidesthedifferencesduetousingdifferentresolutionsandnumerical
relativity codes, the values they reported are close to the ones we
reported in Table 2 in this study.
We also compared our results with current fits available in the
literature.Forthisreason,weusedthestatisticalstudiesondynamicalejecta and disk mass in Nedora et al. (2021) to check whether our
results are in agreement with their fits. We use in particular the fits
for the dynamical ejecta and disk mass listed below (Eq. 8 and 9):
𝑃2
2(𝑞,eΛ)=𝑏0+𝑏1𝑞+𝑏2eΛ+𝑏3𝑞2+𝑏4𝑞eΛ+𝑏5eΛ2; (8)
𝑙𝑜𝑔10(𝑃2
2(𝑞,eΛ))=𝑙𝑜𝑔10(𝑏0+𝑏1𝑞+𝑏2eΛ+𝑏3𝑞2+𝑏4𝑞eΛ+𝑏5eΛ2).(9)
We use the coefficients recommended in Nedora et al. (2021): 𝑏0=
−1.32,𝑏1=−0.382,𝑏2=−4.47×10−3,𝑏3=−0.339,𝑏4=3.21×
10−3,𝑏5=4.31×10−7for the dynamical ejecta, and 𝑏0=−1.85,
𝑏1=2.59,𝑏2=7.07×10−3,𝑏3=−0.733,𝑏4=−8.08×10−4,
𝑏5=2.57×10−7for the disk mass.
The results of these formulae are reported in Table 3. Except for
model M32q10, the amount of dynamical ejecta we estimated in our
simulationsagreeswiththefitscalculatedusingEq.8.Furthermore,
thevalueofejectedmatterfrommodel M32q11isconsistentwiththe
trend. When we compare the disk masses estimated in this study to
those estimated with the fit of Nedora et al. (2021), we see that our
computed values are always less than the disk mass obtained from
the fit. However, such differences may also be related to the various
methodsandtimesinwhichthediskmasswasestimated.Moreover,
Camilletti et al. (2022) reported that among the four EOSs (BLh,
DD2,SFHo,SLy),theSLyEOSusedinoursimulationsprovidesthe
lightest disk mass around a central BH. This could also explain the
discrepancy between our numerical results and the fit estimates.
AccordingtosimulationsruninRadiceetal.(2018)itisproposed
that BNS systems with eΛ<450inevitably promptly collapse into a
BH and form a surrounding disk <0.02𝑀⊙and that systems with
eΛ<400couldnotbecompatiblewithalowerlimitofejectedmatter
inferredfromUV/optical/infraredobservationsofAT2017gfo,which
is the optical counterpart to GW170817. However, it is also stated
inRadiceetal.(2018)andreferencesthereinthatmassratioshigher
than 1.25might also form disks with masses up to 0.1𝑀⊙. Accord-
ing to the outcomes of the models consistent with the chirp mass
of GW170817 in this study ( M30q10, M30q11, M32q18 ), models
M30q11andM32q18with, respectively, eΛ = 335,347may eject at
least 0.05𝑀⊙.Model M30q11mayunboundatleast 0.05𝑀⊙matter
if the disk has an ejection efficiency around 5%. For our promptly
collapse models, M32q18, this contribution should be at least 35%
if we consider the high-spin assumption for GW170817. Therefore,
asstatedinKiuchietal.(2019),wealsoshowthattheunequal-mass
systems with eΛ<400, even if they collapse into a BH promptly,
provide both the lower limit of ejected mass, 0.05𝑀⊙, and disk
mass, 0.08𝑀⊙, reported in Perego et al. (2017). Thus, according to
the simulations we run in this study we may confirm that the lower
bound on eΛmight depend on the mass ratio as suggested in Radice
et al. (2018).

thisstudy.Westartedthesimulationswith 3orbitsbeforethemerger

that, as expected, the disk mass and the amount of dynamically

Additionally, from the evolution of the rest-mass density, we dis-
cussed the possible impact of initial binary mass and mass ratio on
the geometry and mass of the accretion disk that will be formed
around the post-merger NS or BH.

InTable2wereportedthevaluesobtainedfromoursimulationsrun
withstandardresolution(SR),i.e,withaninnermostgridresolution

we performed higher (HR) and lower resolution (LR) simulations
for two models using respectively a resolution of 𝑑𝑥=0.12and
𝑑𝑥=0.20on the finest level. To compute our error, we used the
method of absolute semi-differences given in Eq. A1
𝐸𝑟𝑟=|𝐻𝑅−𝐿𝑅|
2, (A1)
for models M32q10andM32q11. Estimated values for our errors
are given in Table A1. In the two models, the maximum value of
error (last column of Table A1) is considered as an error on related
parameters. Note that due to the wide range of masses from 10−1to
10−5, the errors on disk mass and amount of dynamical ejecta are
given as uncertainties rather than absolute errors.

errors on baryon mass conservation before the merger and BH for-
mation(orovertheentiresimulationformodels M28q10andM30q11)
are, respectively, below 1.4×10−3and2.9×10−3. In this case, the
diskandejectamassesusedinTable2forthemodelsofM32q10and
M32q11 have values smaller than the baryonic mass conservation
error. It should be taken into consideration that it is quite possible
thatthediskandejectamassvaluesobtainedfromthesemodelswere
affected by the baryonic mass conservation error.
To investigate the effect of artificial atmosphere density on disk
mass and ejected matter, we ran simulations with three different

atmosphere density, there is no difference in the amount of disk
mass, but the amount of ejecta varies 1.6times. As a result, the
disk mass should be considered accurate, whereas the ejecta error
estimate is larger.
