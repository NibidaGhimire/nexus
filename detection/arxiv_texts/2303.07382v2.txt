Quadratic light-matter interactions are nonlinear couplings such that quantum emitters interact
with photonic or phononic modes exclusively via the exchange of excitation pairs. Implementable
with atomic and solid-state systems, these couplings lead to a plethora of phenomena that have
been characterized in the context of cavity QED, where quantum emitters interact with localized
bosonic modes. Here, we explore quadratic interactions in a waveguide QED setting, where quantum
emitters interact with propagating fields confined in a one-dimensional environment. We develop a
general scattering theory under the Markov approximation and discuss paradigmatic examples for
spontaneous emission and scattering of biphoton states. Our analytical and semi-analytical results
unveil fundamental differences with respect to conventional waveguide QED systems, such as the
spontaneous emission of frequency-entangled photon pairs or the full transparency of the emitter
to single-photon inputs. This unlocks new opportunities in quantum information processing with
propagating photons. As a striking example, we show that a single quadratically-coupled emitter
can implement a two-photon logic gate with unit fidelity, circumventing a no-go theorem derived for
conventional waveguide-QED interactions.
I. INTRODUCTION
The study of light-matter interactions is one of the
main research pillars of quantum science. The imple-
mentation of systems where quantum emitters inter-
act strongly with confined modes of the electromagnetic
fields has allowed us to achieve an unprecedented level of
control over quantum degrees of freedom [1, 2]. In the
framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED),
the confinement of the electromagnetic field makes it
possible to observe a coherent exchange of excitations
between localized photonic modes and single quantum
emitters [3]. Similarly, the coupling of quantum emit-
ters to propagating fields can be strongly enhanced using
waveguide structures, which confine photons to a one-
dimensional environment [4, 5]. This setup, known as
waveguide QED, has been realized in a variety of plat-
forms such as atoms [6–9] or quantum dots [10, 11] cou-
pled to photonic waveguides, as well as superconducting
qubits [12–20] coupled to microwave transmission lines.
Waveguide QED structures have a great potential to im-
plement building blocks of quantum networks [21, 22],
since propagating photons are ideal to transport flying
qubits over long distances while emitters can provide the
strong quantum non-linearity necessary for quantum in-
formation processing. Therefore, there has been intense
theoretical [23–30] and experimental [31–36] research in
the control and characterization of few-photon correla-
tions generated by single quantum emitters, as well as in
the implementation of photonic devices working at the
few-photon level [37–43].
In the vast majority of platforms, quantum emitters
couple linearly, via dipolar interactions, to photonic or
phononic modes. Such interactions support only the ex-
change of individual quanta—e.g. an atom decays emit-ting a single photon—. Transitions involving multiple
quanta appear as higher-order processes and are there-
fore strongly suppressed. Only recently, it has been
shown how to implement nonlinear couplings where a
quantum emitter interacts with localized bosonic modes
via the direct exchange of two excitation quanta (e.g.
an atom decays emitting a photon pair). Often dubbed
two-photon interactions, these quadratic light-matter
couplings have been proposed in cavity QED settings
such as superconducting qubits non-linearly coupled to
quantum microwave resonators [44–46] or nanomechan-
ical oscillators [47]. Alternatively, quadratic couplings
can also be effectively induced via parametric pump-
ing and other simulation schemes intrinsic to super-
conducting circuits [48], hybrid spin-nanomechanical os-
cillators [49, 50], trapped ions [51–54], and ultracold
atoms [55, 56]. Notice that non-dipolar [57] couplings
have already been observed using superconducting arti-
ficial atoms.
The rich quantum phenomenology arising in quadratic
light-matter interactions motivates a fast-growing inter-
est. For example, the two-photon quantum Rabi model is
characterized by counter-intuitive spectral features such
as the spectral collapse [58–61], which can have direct ob-
servable consequences [45, 51]. Strong quadratic emitter-
field couplings can induce high-order quantum optical
nonlinear processes [44, 62, 63]. Quantum phase tran-
sitions [64–70] and quantum collective-emission phenom-
ena [71, 72] have also been analyzed. This phenomenol-
ogy can be exploited in quantum-information applica-
tions such as non-classical state generation [73–75], quan-
tum sensing [76], cat-qubit stabilization [77] and qubit-
noise spectroscopy [78]. However, so far quadratic light-
matter couplings have only been studied in the case of
localized bosonic modes.arXiv:2303.07382v2  [quant-ph]  11 Sep 20232
In this work, we develop a quantum optics theory to de-
scribe a single quantum emitter interacting quadratically
with the photons that propagate along a one-dimensional
waveguide. We study this problem with a two-photon
scattering theory based on a Wigner-Weisskopf approach
and the Born-Markov approximation. We derive the
general form of the scattering matrix, including semi-
analytical solutions for arbitrary photonic input states
and full analytical solutions for Gaussian inputs. Apply-
ing this theory, we unveil observable features of the emit-
ter’s response that are fundamentally different with re-
spect to conventional waveguide QED setups (see Fig. 1).
These include (i) the spontaneous emission of correlated
biphoton states, (ii) the strong interaction with spec-
trally narrow two-photon pulses, and (iii) full trans-
parency to single-photon inputs. Finally, we show that
these effects can be exploited in quantum information
applications, designing a deterministic controlled-phase
gate that acts on pairs of propagating photons with per-
fect fidelity. This result seems to contradict a famous
no-go theorem for photonic gates [40, 79, 80]. How-
ever, it is the use of quadratic interactions that allows
us to eliminate the wavepacket distortions that are in-
trinsic to the localized non-linearities induced by lin-
ear light-matter coupling [40]. The proposed gate is
based on dual-rail encoding, which is of increasing rel-
evance for superconducting quantum-computing applica-
tions [81]. All results discussed in this work can be im-
plemented using state-of-the-art superconducting quan-
tum emitters [44–46, 48] interacting with propagating mi-
crowave fields or nanomechanical oscillators [47] and we
expect that similar regimes will soon be achievable with
solid-state [49, 50] or atom-based [51–56] nanophotonic
devices.
The work is structured as follows. In Sec. II, we de-
velop a general theory for the scattering of pairs of pho-
tons by a single quantum emitter interacting quadrati-
cally with a one-dimensional waveguide. In Sec. III, we
derive consequences from this theory, such as the two-
photon spontaneous emission law and the two-photon
scattering probabilities. We derive general bounds for the
scattering cross-section valid for arbitrary photon-pair
(biphoton) input states. We then consider specific exam-
ples for spontaneous emission and for the scattering of
biphoton states with Gaussian and Lorentzian frequency
distributions. In Sec. IV, we provide a striking example of
application in quantum-information tasks, showing how
to design a controlled-phase gate with unit fidelity. In
Sec. V, we discuss possible physical implementations of
the considered model. In Sec. VI, we provide conclusions
and the outlook for future directions.
II. SCATTERING THEORY FOR
TWO-PHOTON INTERACTIONS
This section introduces a new scattering theory for
two-photon states impinging on a quadratically-coupled
FIG. 1. Photon scattering on a quadratically-coupled two-
level emitter. The nonlinearity of the light-matter interac-
tion is such that the emitter is completely transparent to
one-photon pulses, while it strongly interacts with the multi-
photon components of the input state. When a two-photon
state is sent as input there are three allowed output channels:
reflection, splitting, and transmission. The frequency distri-
bution of the input photons plays a key role in determining
each channel probability. The frequency of reflected and split
photons are strongly anti-correlated, while the transmitted
photons are positively correlated.
quantum emitter. It describes the model’s Hamiltonian
(II A), the derivation of the scattering equations using the
Wigner-Weisskopf formalism (II B), and the computation
of the two-photon scattering matrix under the Markov
approximation (II C).
A. Model
We consider a two-level quantum emitter with general
quadratic coupling to a continuum of bosonic modes in
a one-dimensional waveguide. Under the rotating-wave
approximation, the system Hamiltonian can be written
as (ℏ= 1),
ˆH=ω0ˆσ+ˆσ−+X
µ∈{±}Z
ωˆaµ†
ωˆaµ
ωdω
+X
µ,µ′∈{±}Z
gµµ′
ωω′ˆσ+ˆaµ
ωˆaµ′
ω′√
2dωdω′+ (H.c.).(1)
Here, ω0and ˆσ+(ˆσ−) are the resonance frequency and
the raising (lowering) operator of the emitter, respec-
tively. The operator ˆ aµ
ω(ˆaµ†
ω) annihilates (creates) a
waveguide photon with frequency ωand propagating di-
rection µ∈ {±} . We denote with gµµ′
ωω′the function
that gives the quadratic coupling strength between the
emitter and the field frequency components. Note that
Eq. (1) is over-parametrized. This is because the rela-
tion [ˆ aµ
ω,(ˆaµ′
ω′)†] =δµ,µ′δω,ω′implies that all vector ele-
ments appear twice in the summation and integration.3
Therefore, we can arbitrarily set the symmetric condi-
tiongµµ′
ωω′=gµ′µ
ω′ω, holding for any µ,µ′,ωandω′. We
will keep the coupling function as general as possible in
the derivation, specifying it only in the examples, in or-
der to identify the intrinsic properties of the quadratic
coupling. The scattering theory that we develop is ap-
plicable to different experimental implementations of the
model.
B. Wigner-Weisskopf ansatz
The Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) commutes with the oper-
ator ˆN=P
µR
ˆaµ†
ωˆaµ
ωdω+ 2ˆσ+ˆσ−. This is a continuous-
symmetry generator associated with the conservation of
the weighted number of excitations [51]. This conser-
vation law implies that the whole dynamics can be de-
scribed using a Wigner-Weisskopf ansatz wavefunction
with a fixed number of (weighted) excitations as defined
byˆN. In the vacuum sector or in the sector with individ-
ual photons, this dynamics is trivial: in both cases, the
photonic states are decoupled from the emitter, which is
transparent to individual photon states.
Consequently, we may focus on solving the scattering
problem for input states with either two incoming pho-
tons and an emitter in the ground state, or an excited
emitter in the vacuum. The most general such state,
|Φ(t)⟩=Ce(t)ˆσ+|0⟩

Cµµ′

is constructed by creating excitations on top of |0⟩,
the tensor product between the bosonic vacuum and
the emitter’s ground state. The two-photon Wigner-
Weisskopf state is normalized as
|Ce(t)|2+X
µ,µ′∈{±}ZCµµ′

dωdω′= 1,(3)
and it holds that Cµµ′
ωω′(t) =Cµ′µ
ω′ω(t) for any µ,µ′,ω,ω′.
The Wigner-Weisskopf ansatz (2) describes a solution
to the Schr¨ odinger equation, i∂t|Φ(t)⟩=ˆH|Φ(t)⟩, pro-
vided the coefficients satisfy a set of coupled, linear ordi-
nary differential equations:
i˙Ce(t) =ω0Ce(t) +X

i˙Cµµ′
ωω′(t) = (ω+ω′)Cµµ′
ωω′(t) + (gµµ′
ωω′)∗Ce(t). (5)
It is convenient to reparameterize the wavefunction’s ele-
ment using the sum and difference of photon frequencies,
ω=ω′+ωand ∆ = ω′−ω, asCµµ′
ω∆(t) and gµµ′
ω∆.
At this stage, let us introduce the Markovian approx-
imation, assuming that the emitter will spontaneously
decay, releasing photons to the waveguide at a rate thatis much slower than its intrinsic frequency, Γ ≪ω0. In
this limit one can formally solve Eq. (5) and replace the
solution into Eq. (4) to obtain (see App. A 1):

The total spontaneous emission rate is self-consistently
defined as
Γ =X
µ,µ′∈{±}Zω0
02π|gµµ′
ω0∆|2d∆≪ω0. (7)
In the standard Markovian approach with linear in-
teractions, the decay rate depends on the frequency of
the emitted photons, although this dependency is usu-
ally weak or ignored [2]. In the case of quadratic light-
matter interactions, the decay rate depends on the cou-
pling strength evaluated at the two-photon resonance,
i.e.atω=ω1+ω2=ω0, and integrated over frequency
differences ∆. We can assume that the coupling strength
does not change significantly with ω, at least in a band
of frequencies around ω0, but we cannot fully eliminate
the dependency on ∆, thus gµµ′
ωω′≡gµµ′
∆. This depen-
dency may be factored into a product of emission rates
γµµ′∈Rand an envelope u(∆) = u(−∆)∈C, i.e.
gµµ′
∆=r
γµµ′
2πu(∆). (8)
We consider ω0to be the dominant energy scale, that
is we take ω0→ ∞ for the upper integration limit in
Eq. (7). This corresponds to assuming that the coupling
function quickly decays with ∆. Then, we take u(∆) to
be a bell-shaped function normalized to 1 in the l2-norm,
i.e.∥u∥l2/√
2 = 1 [82]. This convenient normalization
implies that the function u(∆) encodes the difference-
frequency dependence of the coupling strength, but it
does not affect the total emission rate Γ. As we will see
in the following, the explicit dependence on ∆ has highly
non-trivial consequences on the scattering phenomenol-
ogy and on potential applications.
C. Two-photon scattering matrix
The scattering matrix connects linearly the amplitude
coefficient of the input photons Cµµ′
ω∆(t0) with the output
fieldCµµ′
ω∆(t1) at asymptotic times t1≫t0, when all the
interaction with the quantum emitter has ceased. As ex-
plained in App. A 2, it is derived by integrating Eq. (5)
using the initial and the final times as boundary condi-
tions and equating the results. We obtain:
Cµµ′
ω∆(t1)eiωt1=eiωt0Cµµ′
ω∆(t0)+ip
γµµ′u(∆)∗˜Ce(ω),(9)4
FIG. 2. Spontaneous decay: The plots show the frequency distribution (FD) of the emitted field as a function of the two output
frequencies ω,ω′. We compare the output FDs for two different coupling functions gµµ′
∆=u(∆)p
γµµ′/2π, with an isotropic
spontaneous emission rate γµµ′= Γ/4, where Γ = 0 .004ω0. In the first line, we consider the Gaussian function of Eq. (20), while
in the second line we assume the Lorentzian coupling of Eq. (21). The parameters βof the coupling functions are chosen to
have the same FWHM in both cases. Notice how the spectrum of the spontaneously emitted photons switches from frequency
correlation to anticorrelation as the ratio β/Γ increases. An analysis of the entanglement properties of spontaneously-emitted
photon pairs is provided in Sec. III C.

assuming that the emitter is initially in the ground state
Ce(t0) = 0 and that there is a large temporal separa-
tion between the input and the output events. More
precisely, we require that ( t1−t0)≫1/Γ, so that the
emitter is completely decayed at the time in which the
output state is formally defined Ce(t1) = 0. For simplic-
ity, in the following we consider the narrow-bandwidth
limit and extend the integration region to ∞in Eq. (10)
(see App. A 2). This assumption is not strictly needed to
obtain semi-analytical results.
For the sake of clarity, let us first write the scatter-
ing relations for a fixed propagation direction of the in-
put field along the waveguide. In other words, we set
Cµµ′
ω∆(t0) =Cω∆(t0)δµ
λδµ′
λ′for some fixed λandλ′, where
δµ
λis a Kronecker delta. In this way, we can remove thesummation in the direction index in Eq. (10). This as-
sumption will be dropped in the final expression of the
scattering matrix. After all these manipulations, the out-
put and input states are related through

As in the standard case of dipolar interactions, the out-
put field is the interference between the input bipho-
ton state (first line) and the two photons re-emitted by
the atom (second line). Also as in standard waveguide
QED, the Markovian approximation manifests itself in
the Lorentzian dependency with respect to the total en-
ergy of the input field ω. However, differently from the
dipolar case, for quadratic interactions the re-emitted
field depends on the relative frequency ∆ through the
interaction envelope u(∆). In the next sections, we will
explore the consequences of this relationship. Let us now
write a general relation for the two-photon scattering ma-
trix.5

Consider a quadratic interaction between bosonic
modes and a two-level emitter, defined by the Hamilto-
nian in Eq. (1), under Markovian approximation Γ≪ω0.

where a summation is implicit over the repeated indexes

where we defined

In Eqs. (12) and (13), we identify that the integration
with u(∆)u(∆′) plays the role of a projection onto a spe-
cific biphoton distribution u(∆). The action of the scat-
tering matrix onto the input state is better understood
if we explicitly separate the parallel and orthogonal com-
ponents to u(∆) as
Cµµ′
ω∆(t) =Cµµ′
ω∆,⊥(t) +Cµµ′
ω∆,∥(t), (15)
with
Cµµ′
ω∆,∥(t) =u(∆)∗Z∞
0d∆′u(∆′)Cµµ′

The scattering relation can then be rewritten as

(17)
The orthogonal component Cµµ′
ω∆,⊥is unperturbed by the
quantum emitter. The parallel component experiences
a transformation χµµ′
αα′(ω) = δµ
αδµ′
α′+ Θµµ′
αα′(ω) which is
analogous of the scattering phase for a single photon in
waveguide QED with linear Markovian interaction [23].
III. PARADIGMATIC CASES
In this section, we study the phenomenology of sponta-
neous emission (III A) and two-photon scattering (III B),
analyzing the cross-section and the spectral features of
the output channels. In the case of scattering of bipho-
ton states, we provide general bounds on the scattering
probabilities which hold for arbitrary frequency distribu-
tions of the input. We then focus on the Gaussian case,
where we are able to give explicit analytical solutionsfor the scattering matrix and gather physical intuition
on the features of the scattering problem. We also repro-
duce the analysis in the semi-analytical case of Lorentzian
coupling function, which confirms that the results of the
Gaussian case are valid for biphoton states of high ex-
perimental relevance.
A. Spontaneous emission
When we excite the quantum emitter in a waveguide
without photons and both interact via Eq. (1), we ex-
pect the emitter to relax to the ground state emitting
two photons. We can use the Wigner-Weisskopf theory
[see Eq. (6)] to derive the frequency distribution of the
emitted photons at asymptotic times. In the Markovian
regime, the amplitude of the emitter’s excited state de-
cays exponentially with the rate Γ introduced in Eq. (7):
Ce(t) =e−iω0(t−t0)e−Γ
2(t−t0). (18)
The emitted photon wavepacket in frequency space at
long times t1≫t0is recovered by inserting Eq. (18) into
Eq. (9). This wavefunction,
Cµµ′
ω∆(t1)2
=1
2πγµµ′|u(∆)|2
Γ2/4 + (ω0−ω)2, (19)
depends on the sum ωand on the difference of frequen-
cies ∆. This profile resembles the Lorentzian lineshape
that is characteristic of Markovian dynamics, where the
wavepacket is centered around the total energy of ωof
the incoming photons. However, the actual wavepacket is
now shaped by the dependence of the interaction on the
relative frequency of the photons gµµ′
∆. This is a general
result that can be applied to very different experimental
scenarios.
Example: Gaussian and Lorentzian coupling
functions– As an example, let us compute the spectrum
of the spontaneously emitted photon pairs in Eq. (19),
assuming two different frequency distributions for
the coupling function. The first coupling function is
Gaussian with zero mean and variance β2, i.e.
gµµ′,G
∆ =r

For comparison, we consider also a Lorentzian distributed
coupling

. (21)
This gives us an expression for |Cµµ′
ω∆(t1)|2via Eq. (19).
In Fig. 2, we plot the emission rate for three different val-
ues of β, in the isotropic case where γµµ′= Γ/4. Notice
that, unless a non-isotropic emitter or a chiral waveguide6
is considered [83], there are three possible output chan-
nels, such that the photon pairs are emitted on the same
direction or they can split. The frequency distribution is
shown in Fig. 2 and it is the same for the three possible
channels.
Summarizing, similarly to standard linear couplings
the decay of the emitter excitation is exponential. Strong
elements of novelty are: (i) Spontaneous decay of a sin-
gle emitter results in the generation of a photon pair. (ii)
The emitted biphoton state has a non-trivial frequency
distribution, which is Lorentzian in the sum-frequency
variable (main diagonal in Fig. 2, width set by the to-
tal decay rate Γ), while it reproduces the coupling func-
tion in the difference-frequency variable [anti-diagonal in
Fig. 2, width set by the full width at half maximum,
FWHM, of u(∆)]. (3) Interestingly, it is possible to gen-
erate frequency-correlated or anticorrelated photon pairs
by changing the ratio between the total emission rate Γ
and the FWHM of the coupling function u(∆).
B. Scattering of two-photon inputs
Let us discuss the phenomenology that appears in the
scattering dynamics computed in Sec. II C. As sketched
in Fig. 1, for two copropagating input photons λλ′= ++,
there are three possible outcomes classified by the out-
put directions: (i) reflection ( µµ′=−−), (ii) transmis-
sion ( µµ′= ++) and (iii) splitting ( µ̸=µ′), depending
on whether both directions are preserved or reversed, or
become opposite to each other. The respective scatter-
ing probabilities integrated over the complete frequency
range are
Pµµ′=RR
|Cµµ′
ω∆(t1)|2d∆dωRR
|C++
ω∆(t0)|2d∆dω. (22)
These values depend on the particular input field, but
they exhibit general symmetries P−+=P+−and con-
straints that can be derived from Prop. 1.
Let us find an upper bound to the reflection probability
under reasonable assumptions on the input state. This
corresponds to maximizing Eq. (22) for µµ′=−−. Let
us assume the atom to be initially in its ground state and
the input field probability amplitude to be separable in
∆ and ω, i.e.
C++
ω∆(t0) =f(ω)h(∆), (23)
where f(ω) and h(∆) are complex functions normalized
in the l2-norm, i.e. ∥f∥l2= 1 = ∥h∥l2/√
2. By using the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in Eq. (12), we obtain
C−−
ω∆(t1)≤C++
ω∆(t0)·Θ−−
++(ω). (24)
The inequality in Eq. (24) is saturated if and only if
h(∆) = eiφu(∆)∗, that is when the frequency distri-
bution of the input field matches the coupling function
gµµ′
∆=gµµ′u(∆). Inserting Eq. (24) into Eq. (22) andusing Holder’s inequality, we obtain that the reflection
probability R≡P−−is bounded by
R≤1
2∥f∥2
l2∥h∥2
l2∥Θ−−
++∥2
l∞=4γ++γ−−
Γ2≡Rmax.(25)
This inequality is saturated when the bandwidth δof the
input field f(ω)—measured as the FWHM or by some
other means—is much narrower than the emitter’s natu-
ral linewidth Γ ≫δ.
We can also derive exact expressions for the maximal
achievable rates of splitting S≡2P−+and transmission
T≡P++processes, defined as
S≤8γ++γ−+
Γ2≡Smax, (26)
T≥1−Rmax−Smax≡Tmin. (27)
While in waveguide QED with linear interactions a sin-
gle emitter can perfectly reflect a single photon [37], the
perfect two-photon reflection by a quadratically-coupled
emitter is only possible when the splitting process is sup-
pressed, i.e. γ−+= 0 and γ++=γ−−. In the case of
isotropic interactions γµµ′= Γ/4, this is thus not pos-
sible. Here, even for optimal frequency-matched input
h(∆) = eiφu(∆)∗, one obtains Rmax= 1/4,Smax= 1/2
andTmin= 1/4.
Example: Gaussian wavepackets– Let us discuss a scat-
tering experiment with Gaussian couplings and Gaus-
sian input wavepackets that has analytical solutions and
which provides insight that is extensible to other situa-
tions, e.g., the Lorentzian case shown in App. B. Without
loss of generality, we use the isotropic Gaussian coupling
function with variance β2from Eq. (20). The input state
is formed by two Gaussian wavepackets with frequencies
ω1,2, propagating along the same direction (++) with
identical widths α2. The state is separable both on the

Let us now analyze the phenomenology described by this
analytical result, focusing on the spectral properties of
the output field and the scattering probabilities.7
FIG. 3. Two photon scattering, Gaussian case. We compare the transmitted and reflected/splitted frequency distributions
(FDs) for two different values of the total emission rate, Γ = 0 .004ω0for the first and Γ = 0 .012ω0for the second line. The
FD for the reflection and splitting processes are identical. The FDs are shown in function of the two frequency variables ω,ω′.
The input field has been chosen as the product of two independent Gaussian FDs in ωand ∆, centered at ω0(corresponding
to the two-photon resonance condition), variance α2= (0.02ω0)2and FWHM= 2 α√
2 ln 2 = 0 .047ω0. We consider a Gaussian
distributed coupling [Eq. (20)] with β=αand we assume an isotropic spontaneous emission rate, i.e. γµµ′= Γ/4. Focusing
on the scattered field (rightmost plots), we see that the width in the sum-frequency variable ω(main diagonal) is proportional
to Γ, while the width in the difference-frequency variable ∆ (anti-diagonal) is given by the input field variance α2(which has
been set equal to that of the coupling function). Interestingly, we see that, when both photons are transmitted, their frequency
distribution is correlated, while it is strongly anti-correlated for the reflection and splitting processes.
FIG. 4. Plot of the reflection probability, i.e. P−−, as a
function of the ratio β/α. To obtain the plot, we considered a
Gaussian input [Eq. (28)] centered in ω0with variance α2and
a Gaussian coupling with variance β2[Eq. (20)]. In addition,
we assumed an isotropic spontaneous emission rate. We com-
pare the reflection probability for different values of Γ and we
show that the maximum value of P−−is reached when α=β
and Γ ≫α.In Fig. 3, we plot the spectral distribution of the re-
flected ( µ, µ′=−,−), split ( µ, µ′=±,∓) and transmit-
ted (µ, µ′= +,+) states, derived from Eq. (29) for two
values of Γ. The distribution of the scattered/split pho-
tons is strongly anti-correlated in frequency, even though
the input state was a separable one. A careful obser-
vation of the formulas reveals how the output field can
be tailored by choosing the input state and by engineer-
ing the coupling function. In the sum-frequency vari-
ableω[main diagonal in Fig. 3], the distribution has a
Lorentzian shape whose width is established by the in-
tensity of the light-matter coupling strength Γ. A larger
value of the parameter Γ translates into a larger FWHM
for the reflected frequency distribution. In the difference-
frequency variable ∆ [anti-diagonal in Fig. 3], the distri-
bution has a Gaussian shape whose width depends on
the widths of the input distribution αand of the cou-
pling function β.
In Fig. 4, we analyze how the total reflection rate de-
pends on the input frequency distribution and the emitter
properties. We plot P−−as a function of the ratio be-
tween the standard deviation βof the coupling function
[see Eq. (20)] and the standard deviation αof the sum-
frequency distribution of the input field [see Eq. (28)].8

in opposite directions. (b) Entanglement entropy of the post-selected state of Eq. (32), as a function of the detuning of the

As expected, the scattering rate is maximal when the
input frequency distribution matches the coupling func-
tion, a specific occurrence of the general results derived
in Sec. II C. By probing different emission rates Γ, Fig. 4
also confirms that the upper bound on the reflection
probability P−−= 1/4 is attainable when the width of
the input frequency distribution is small compared to the
emitter line width, Γ ≫α.
C. Entanglement generation
From the phenomenological analysis of Sec. III A and
Sec. III B, one can easily infer that two-photon states
scattered or spontaneously emitted by a quadratically-
coupled emitter have non-trivial entanglement proper-
ties. In general, the scattered/emitted states are hyper-
entangled, i.e.non-classical correlations are present both
in the position and in the frequency degrees of freedom.
For the sake of brevity, we will focus here on entangle-
ment generated in the (continuous) frequency variable.
We consider a specific measurement setting relevant for
practical experiments and applications such as quantum
key distribution. Let us take the case of a spontaneously
emitted two-photon state, which can be obtained by plug-
ging the result of Eq. (19) in the definition of the state
Eq. (2). We consider the setup shown in Fig. 5(a), that
is we take the post-selected state |ψPS⟩in which the pho-
tons are emitted in opposite directions, i.e.
|ψPS⟩=NZ
C(ω, ω′)(ˆa+
ωˆa−
ω′)†dωdω′|0⟩, (30)
where Nis a renormalization factor and where we
have re-expressed the output frequency distribution
C(ω, ω′) =C+−
ω,∆(t1) as a function of the frequencies of
the output photons ωandω′. Bipartite entanglement in
a continuous variable such as the frequency can be fully
characterized with a Schmidt decomposition [84, 85].
However, here we consider a simpler approach that is of
direct experimental relevance. We identify two discrete
frequency modes by applying frequency filters, definedby the functions f(ω). The effect of the filters is mod-
eled by applying the following transformation to the state
distribution:
C(ω, ω′)→ZZ
dωdω′C(ω−ω,ω′−ω′)f(ω)f(ω′).(31)
We choose the filters to have two narrow transmission
windows, so that they are well approximated by the sum
of two Dirac deltas centered around frequencies ωaand
ωb,f(ω) =δ(ω−ωa) +δ(ω−ωb). After the filters, the
(post-selected state) can be written as
|ψPS⟩=C(ωa, ωa)|ωa, ωa⟩+C(ωa, ωb)|ωa, ωb⟩
+C(ωb, ωa)|ωb, ωa⟩+C(ωb, ωb)|ωb, ωb⟩,(32)
where the first(second) quantum number in the ket no-
tation encodes the frequency of left(right) propagating
photons, that is |ωa, ωb⟩ ≡(ˆa+
ωaˆa−
ωb)†|0⟩.
We can now characterize the entanglement of the
two-qubit state defined by Eq. (32). As entanglement
measure we use the entanglement entropy defined as
S(|ψPS⟩) =−Tr [ρ1log2ρ1], where we defined the re-
duced density operator ρ1= Tr sys2{|ψPS⟩⟨ψPS|}, ob-
tained by tracing out system 2 to the global state of
Eq. (32). In Fig. 5(b) and (c) we analyze the behavior of
the entanglement for different system parameters, con-
sidering the frequency distribution of Eq. (19) with the
Lorentzian coupling function of Eq. (21). We take the
filters to be centered around frequencies symmetric with
respect to the atomic resonance, that is we fix ωa=ω0−δ
andωb=ω0+δin Eq. (32). In Fig. 5(b) we show that the
entanglement entropy grows with the frequency-offset δ,
until it saturates to a plateau. This is consistent with
the intuition gathered by looking at Fig. 2. Indeed, the
output frequency distribution is separable close to the
resonance condition, while positive or negative correla-
tions can be observed far from resonance. To further
characterize correlations, in Fig. 5(c) we show the entan-
glement entropy S(|ψPS⟩) as a function of the ratio be-
tween the width βof the coupling function and the total
emission rate Γ. For β/Γ = 1 we observe a minimum of9
the entanglement entropy, as the frequency distribution is
approximately separable [see Fig. 2]. For small values of
β/Γ [Fig. 5(d)] the state is strongly correlated, and in the
limit β/Γ→0 the state asymptotically approaches a Bell
state lim β/Γ→0|ψPS⟩=|ψ−⟩ ≡1
2(|ωa, ωa⟩ − |ωb, ωb⟩).
On the contrary, for large values of β/Γ [see Fig. 5(e)],
the output photons are anticorrelated in frequency and
the state asymptotically approaches the following Bell
state lim β/Γ→∞|ψPS⟩=|ϕ+⟩ ≡1
2(|ωa, ωb⟩+|ωb, ωa⟩).
Therefore, quadratically-coupled atoms represent a com-
pelling tool to generate frequency-entangled states, which
are relevant for a variety of quantum-information appli-
cations [85–88]. In the following section, we provide an-
other striking example of potential applications.
IV. IDEAL CONTROLLED-PHASE GATE FOR
PROPAGATING PHOTONS
Let us now provide a compelling application of this
phenomenology in quantum computing tasks. We con-
sider a controlled-phase gate implemented on qubits de-
fined with a dual-rail encoding, which is of increasing
relevance for quantum computing with superconducting
circuits [81]. In particular, we consider an encoding
where each qubit is defined as a single photon distributed
along two propagating modes ˆ aandˆb, such that the log-
ical states are encoded as |0⟩L= ˆa†|0,0⟩=|1,0⟩and
|1⟩L=ˆb†|0,0⟩=|0,1⟩. Regardless of the physical en-
coding, a c-phase (or control-Z) gate is defined by the
transformation
|0c⟩|0s⟩ → | 0c⟩|0s⟩
|0c⟩|1s⟩ → | 0c⟩|1s⟩
|1c⟩|0s⟩ → | 0c⟩|1s⟩
|1c⟩|1s⟩ → −| 1c⟩|1s⟩, (33)
where candsdenote the control and signal logical qubits,
respectively.
It has been shown in Ref. [40] that, by first principles,
it is impossible to implement this gate with unit fidelity
using a single (point-like) two-level quantum emitter as
the nonlinear element. The reason is that a distortion
of the wavefunction frequency distribution is unavoid-
ably introduced, as conflicting requirements on the input
state should be imposed for the single- and two-photon
scattering events. This no-go theorem has been derived
assuming standard linear interactions. There are alterna-
tive proposals to circumvent such an intrinsic limitation,
but they come at the cost of using multi-level artificial
atoms [89], an array of many emitters [90], or an active
time-dependent modulation of the coupling strength [91].
In the following, we propose a straightforward scheme
that can overcome this limitation and implement a pas-
sive protocol for a c-phase gate with (in principle) unit
fidelity, by using a single quadratically coupled two-level
emitter per path. The scheme (sketched in Fig. 6) iscomposed of four semi-open waveguides (two for the con-
trol and two for the signal photons), each encoding a
state of one of the two logical qubits. A balanced beam-
splitter (BS), represented as a directional coupler in the
sketch, connects the |1c⟩and|1s⟩paths. As the BS is
traversed back and forth, it does not modify the logi-
cal input states. As a result, since quadratically coupled
emitters are transparent to single-photon signals, it can
be shown by direct inspection that the first three oper-
ations of Eq. (33) are correctly implemented. When the
input state is |1c,1s⟩, after the first passage in the BS
the state will be1√
2(|2c,0s⟩+|0c,2s⟩), i.e. the photons
will come out from the same path. The role of the BS
is then to send both photons toward the same emitter if
and only if the input state is |1c,1s⟩.
Let us analyze the process in which two photons |2c,0s⟩
(or equivalently |0c,2s⟩) scatter from the quadratically
coupled emitters. We will compute which wavefunction
of the two input photons maximizes the gate fidelity,
studying the problem in frequency space. When the
emitter is placed at the end of a semi-infinite waveg-
uide, all photons are reflected, and the probability am-
plitudes of the output field are given by Prop. 1 with
γ−−=γ−+= 0, and the only non-zero coupling term is
g++
∆=q
γ++
2πu(∆), with ∥u∥l2/√
2 = 1. From Eq. (7),
it follows that Γ = γ++. As shown in Sec. III B, the op-
timal interaction is achieved when the input state wave-
function in frequency space matches the distribution of
the coupling. Consequently, we assume a biphoton input
state given by C++
ω∆(t0) =f(ω)u(∆)∗, where ∥f∥l2= 1.
Following Prop 1, the output field is

where we dropped the propagation-direction indexes for
the sake of brevity. Note how the output field equals
the input field C++
ω∆(t0) =f(ω)u(∆)∗times a Lorentzian
(in square brackets) in ω, which in the limit of ω≃ω0
approaches −1. We may use this limit to implement
a c-phase gate, by imposing that the input state f(ω)
is a Bell-shaped function, with FWHM δ, concentrated
around the resonance frequency ω0. In the limit of nar-
row photons, Γ ≫δ, the output field acquires the desired
nonlinear phase Cω∆(t1)≈ −e−iω0(t1−t0)Cω∆(t0), up to
a phase e−iω0(t1−t0)common to all logical input states.
Let us now analyze the performance of the controlled-
phase gate, estimating the worst-case fidelity over all
possible logical qubit states |ψ⟩=a|0c0s⟩+b|0c1s⟩+
c|1c0s⟩+d|1c1s⟩. In a loss-less waveguide, the worst-
case fidelity is defined as [40]

where ˆUis the ideal c-phase gate and ˆEare the actual
operation experienced by the single and biphoton states.
In our setup, only the two-photon state experiences a10
FIG. 6. Sketch of the circuit scheme that implements a
controlled-phase gate using two-level quantum emitters. The
scheme has been proposed in [40] to show intrinsic limitations
to the achievable fidelity. Here, we show that in the case of
quadratic interactions, there are no fundamental limits and
the fidelity can in principle be arbitrarily close to 1. The ori-
gin of this advantage is that, for quadratic couplings, only
the input state |1c,1s⟩interacts with the emitters. For all
other input states, only single photons impinge on the emit-
ters, which are fully transparent in the one-photon subspace.

Both the input frequency distributions f(ω) are centered in

In Fig. 7, we show the worst-case gate logarithmic in-
fidelity as a function of Γ expressed in units of the input
FWHM. We compared two different relevant input cases:
f(ω) real Normal distributed and f(ω) real Lorentzian
distributed. Both distributions are centered on the reso-
nance frequency ω0and have the same FWHM. We ob-
serve a steeper slope for the Normally distributed f(ω)
with respect to the Lorentzian one, due to the higher vari-
ance of the latter. Most importantly, in the limit of nar-
row inputs, FWHM ≪Γ, the worst-case gate fidelity ap-
proaches 1, thus overcoming the intrinsic limitation [40]
found when considering linear interactions. This unan-
ticipated result is of high conceptual value, as part of a
prototypical analysis based of an effective model. An as-
sessment of the fidelity achievable in practice should be
done considering a specific device and keeping into ac-
count the corresponding main sources of dissipation and
decoherence.
V. DISCUSSION ON PHYSICAL
IMPLEMENTATIONS
Let us now provide comments on possible physical im-
plementations of the considered model. There are two
main approaches to implement quadratic interactions in
the context of cavity QED. The first one consists in
designing effective implementations, or analog quantum
simulations, where an external driving is used to se-
lectively activate pump-induced interactions. This ap-
proach can be applied to a broad variety of quantum
platforms and it was considered to design quadratic in-
teractions first for atomic systems [51–56] and then in
solid state devices [48–50]. The second approach consists
in engineering genuine quadratic couplings, such that the
nonlinearity of the interaction is intrinsic and the ex-
change of excitations is not mediated by external driv-
ings. Genuine implementations have been designed for
superconducting quantum circuits [44–46] and nanome-
chanical resonators [47]. In particular, the most promis-
ing platform to implement the proposed controlled-gate
is circuit QED [92], where decoherence and noise sources
can be typically controlled within the 1%. In this frame-
work, it was shown that it is possible to engineer a gen-
uine quadratic qubit-cavity coupling [44] while fully in-
hibiting the linear coupling. It was also shown that a
similar implementation can even be pushed into the ul-
trastrong coupling regime [45]. Such proposals are based
on a flux qubit inductively coupled to a SQUID device,
where the latter is operated in a weakly-nonlinear regime
and is well approximated by a harmonic mode.11
FIG. 8. Sketch of proposed implementations of quadratic
coupling with propagating modes, generalizing established
methods for the cavity QED setting. (a) A quadratically-
coupled emitter embedded in an array of coupled resonators,
that supports a discrete number of propagating modes. (b)
A quadratic atom-cavity system linearly coupled to external
waveguides. In the bad-cavity limit, the cavity mode can be
adiabatically eliminated, obtaining an effective quadratic in-
teraction between qubit and propagating modes.
Currently, it is therefore well understood how to design
genuine implementations of quadratic interactions be-
tween a quantum emitter and localized harmonic modes.
Going a step further, here we envision two ways in which
these cavity QED settings could be directly generalized
to implement quadratic couplings to propagating modes:
(i) The most straightforward generalization is shown in
Fig. 8(a) and consists in implementing an array of cou-
pled cavities which supports propagating modes [93, 94].
A quadratically-coupled emitter could be added using
known designs into one of the resonators of the array. In
this case, the quadratic coupling function to propagating
modes would depend on the collective mode structure of
the resonator array, and in the weak coupling limit we
expect the effective dynamics to be Markovian [93] as as-
sumed in this work. (ii) An alternative solution is shown
in Fig. 8(b) and consists in considering a quadratic atom-
resonator system in the bad cavity limit, where the res-
onator dissipation rate is large compared to the coupling
so that its modes can be adiabatically eliminated [95, 96].
In this case, we expect an effective quadratic coupling
with Lorentzian-like distribution between the artificial
atom and the propagating modes of waveguides coupled
to the leaky resonator.
These two solutions allow the implementation of the
considered model with known results. A possible solu-
tion that would require further analyses consists in gen-
eralizing the superconducting circuit designs [44, 45] to
a native waveguide-QED setting. In the simplest case,
such a configuration could consist in a superconducting
transmission-line waveguide that is galvanically coupled
to a flux qubit through a SQUID. More complex con-
figurations could be designed considering SQUID-based
metamaterials. A detailed analysis of any of these im-
plementations should be performed considering the mi-
croscopic modeling of the specific platform and this is
outside the scope of this paper.VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
This work introduces the study of quadratic light-
matter couplings in the field of waveguide QED. We have
developed a general scattering theory with a broad range
of applicability to solid-state and atomic quantum tech-
nologies. The predicted phenomenology is fundamentally
different from what is observable with standard dipolar
couplings and it bears great potential for quantum infor-
mation applications. Remarkably, we show that a single
quadratically coupled emitter can overcome a well-known
no-go theorem and implement a controlled-phase gate
on flying qubits with unit fidelity. Let us discuss the
future perspectives in this novel research line, focusing
first on the observation of an unconventional quantum
phenomenology and then on the potential for quantum
information applications.
In the framework of waveguide QED, quadratically-
coupled emitters can be embedded in very different se-
tups and configurations. For instance, the placement of
artificial atoms in arrays with sub-wavelength spacing
can be used to enhance/inhibit their individual emis-
sion rate and scattering properties, both in standard
and chiral waveguides. The emergence of collective ef-
fects arising from many quadratically-coupled emitters
has so far been studied only in the context of cavity
QED [71, 72]. Nonlinear waveguide QED devices can also
undergo interaction-induced phase transitions [97, 98].
Alternatively, quadratically coupled emitters can be used
as nonlinear mirrors that confine multiphoton states,
by analogy with similar studies in the dipolar coupling
regime [99]. Furthermore, the quadratic coupling in
waveguide-QED setups can be pushed into the non-
Markovian or even in the ultrastrong-coupling regime,
requiring the development of new theoretical and numer-
ical tools [13] and opening the door to new correlated
phases and quantum phase transitions. Finally, nonlin-
ear couplings can also be combined with the framework
of giant atoms [100].
As demonstrated in this work, quadratic light-matter
couplings are a compelling tool to process quantum infor-
mation encoded in propagating photons. This possibility
should be thoroughly addressed considering each specific
experimental setting, with a detailed microscopic model
of the system and realistic noise sources. The most inter-
esting case is provided by superconducting quantum cir-
cuits, for which the dual-rail encoding is of high relevance
for quantum computing [81]. Finally, besides gates in the
dual-rail encoding, quadratic light-matter couplings can
be used to deterministically generate propagating bipho-
ton states or to implement highly non-trivial photon sub-
traction processes. The possibility of tailoring the spec-
tral features of emitted/scattered biphoton states paves
also the way to the generation of entanglement in the
time-frequency domain, which is relevant for quantum
computation [85] and sensing [86–88] applications.12

Appendix A: Wigner-Weisskopf Theory
In this section, we provide a detailed derivation of the
scattering matrix (Prop. 1) starting from the system of
coupled differential equations for the amplitude proba-
bility coefficients in Eq. (4) and Eq. (5).
1. Markovian approximation
We start by solving formally the differential equation
for the field amplitude probability coefficient Cµµ′

Inserting this result in Eq. (4) allows us to decouple the
system of equations and find a linear self-consistent dif-
ferential equation for Ce(t):

t0|gµµ′
ωω′|2Ce(τ)ei(ω+ω′)(τ−t)dτ.
(A2)
The last term in Eq. (A2) can be further simplified. First,
we change the integration variables defining ω=ω′+ω,
∆ =ω′−ωanddωdω′=dωd∆

(A3)Then we rewrite the integral as

ωω′|2Ce(τ)ei(ω+ω′)(τ−t)dτ=

the kernel

µ,µ′∈{±}Z∞
0d∆Z∞

So far the treatment is exact. Now we perform the
Markovian approximation on the basis of two assump-
tions. First, we assume the coupling strength to be weak
with respect to the emitter frequency ω0. First-order
perturbation theory allows us to rewrite the solution of
Eq. (A2) as Ce(t)≈e−iω0tSe(t), where Se(t) is a slowly-
varying function of time. Second, we point out that, if
the coupling strength has a weak dependence on ω, the
Kernel K(t) is a rapidly-decaying function. Note that
indeed, in the limit in which the coupling is flat in fre-
quency, the Kernel is proportional to a Dirac delta in
time. So, if the coupling strength is perturbative and
sufficiently smooth with respect to ω, we can approxi-
mate Se(t) as a constant in the short time interval in
which K(t) is non-vanishing. Accordingly, we can set
Se(t−τ)∼Se(t) in the time integral in Eq. (A4) and
recombine the terms so that

Note that for any specific form of the coupling strength,
the integral in the last equation is now explicit and it can
be evaluated by analytical or numerical means. However,
to have a general analytical expression, we can take a
further step and extend to infinity the upper limit of in-
tegration in Eq. (A6). This corresponds to assuming that
the Kernel correlation length is zero (which is standard
in the Markov approximation, as it is exactly true when
the coupling strength is natively constant with respect to
ω). Under this limit, performing the time-integration in
Eq. (A4), we obtain

FIG. 9. Two photon scattering, Lorentzian case. We compare the transmitted and reflected/split FDs for two different values
of the total emission rate, Γ = 0 .004ω0for the first and Γ = 0 .012ω0for the second line. The FD for the reflection and splitting
processes are identical. The FDs are shown in function of the two frequency variables ω,ω′. The input field has been chosen
as the product of two independent Gaussian FDs in ωand ∆, centered at ω0(corresponding to the two-photon resonance
condition), variance α2= (0.02ω0)2and FWHM= 2 α√
2 ln 2 = 0 .047ω0. We consider a Lorentzian distributed coupling as
in [Eq. (21)] with β= 2α√
2 ln 2, in order to have the same FWHM for the input field and for the coupling. We assume an
isotropic spontaneous emission rate, i.e. γµµ′= Γ/4.
where we have defined the total emission rate as
Γ =X

We have also defined the Lamb shift

which is a small shift in the emitter resonance frequency.
Here and in the main text, we absorb δein the definition
ofω0, as in most cases the experimental characterization
of the emitter frequency already includes the Lamb shift.
Now that all the terms in Eq. (A2) have been simplified,
we are able to write a compact expression for the atom
amplitude probability differential equation [Eq. (6) in the
main text],

2. Scattering states
As done in Eq. (A1), we can formally solve for Cµµ′
ωω′(t)
setting the initial conditions for a time t1≫t0:
Cµµ′
ωω′(t) =Cµµ′
ωω′(t1)e−i(ω+ω′)(t−t1)
+i(gµµ′
ωω′)∗e−i(ω+ω′)(t−t1)Zt1
tCe(τ)ei(ω+ω′)(τ−t0)dτ.
(A13)
Subtracting Eq. (A1) from Eq. (A13), we find an input-
output relation for the field before ( t=t0) and after
(t=t1) the scattering event:
Cµµ′
ω∆(t1) =e−iω(t1−t0)Cµµ′

where we switched to the frequency-sum and difference
variables and we have used that gµµ′
ω∆=q

We now take the Fourier transform of Eq. (A11) [or14
Eq. (6)] and integrate by parts the left side, assuming
thatCe(t0/1) = 0. We obtain
˜Ce(ω) =−X

where we have used that, for t1≫t0, we can approximateRt1

we find

In the main text, we consider the narrow-bandwidth
limit and extend to infinity the range of the integra-
tion over ∆ in the previous expression. This corresponds
to assuming that the input distribution is non-vanishing
only in a region around a central frequency which is of
the order of ω0(for two-photon interactions the inputphotons are resonant when the sum of their frequencies
matches the emitter frequency). We also remind that
u(∆) is bell-shaped and non-zero only for ∆ ≪ω0.
Appendix B: Lorentzian case
In Sec. III B, we have presented results for the scat-
tering of two-photon states in the Gaussian case, which
can be analytically solved and allows one to understand
the fundamental features of the two-photon scattering
problem on a quadratically-coupled emitter. Let us now
show that those features are not modified in the case
of Lorentzian coupling functions [see Eq. (21)], which
are more frequently encountered in realistic physical sys-
tems. This case can be solved semi-analytically using the
results of Prop. 1, by numerically integrating Eq. (12).
The results are presented in Fig. 9 and good qualitative
agreement is found with the Gaussian case presented in
Fig. 3.
