1 Introduction
.
This is the continuation of the author’s ArXiv presentation ‘’On packin g
of Minkowski balls. I” [13]. In section two “Critical lattices, Minkowsk i do-
mainsandtheiroptimalpacking”weinvestigatelatticepackingsofMin kowski
1domains. By results of the proof of Minkowski conjecture about t he criti-
cal determinant we devide the domains on 3 classes: Minkowski, Davis and
Chebyshev-Cohn. The optimal lattice packings of the domains are o btained.
Section three gives minimum areas of inscribed and circumscribed hex agons
of Minkowski, Davis and Chebyshev-Cohn domains. In section four p resents
preliminary notions connected with two-dimensional Banach spaces which
deﬁne Minkowski norms
|x|p+|y|p, p∈R,p≥1,
on real plane R2= (x,y). Results of sections two, three and four lead to
algebro-geometric structures in the framework of Pontryagin du ality theory
and its extensions. Direct limits of direct systems of Minkowski balls a nd
domains and their critical lattices are calculated.
2 Critical lattices, Minkowski domains and
their optimal packing
LetDbe a ﬁxed bounded symmetric about origin convex body ( centrally
symmetric convex body for short) with volume V(D). When considering
packing problems for such D, it does not matter whether we consider such
Dwith or without a boundary [3, 4].
Proposition 1 [3, 4]. IfDis symmetric about the origin and convex, then
2Dis convex and symmetric about the origin.
Corollary 1 Letmbe integerm≥0andnbe natural greater m. If2mD
centrally symmetric convex body then 2nDis again centrally symmetrc convex
body.
Proof.Induction.
We will called 2mDthe 2mdublingofD.
Deﬁnitions of Minkowski, Davis and Chebyshev-Cohn balls are given in
[13]. Now we extend their on respective domains.
Recall that this division of general Minkowski balls (9) is based on the
results of the proof of the Minkowski conjecture [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 1 2] and the
Corollary 1.
For ease of reading, we present the main result of [7].
2Theorem 1 [7]
∆(Dp) =/braceleftbigg∆(p,1),1≤p≤2, p≥p0,
∆(p,σp),2≤p≤p0;
herep0≈2.5725is a real constant that is deﬁned uniquely by the conditions
∆(p0,σp) = ∆(p0,1); note that 2,57≤p0≤2,58.
Remark 1 We will call p0the Davis constant.
2.1 Domains.
We consider the following classes of balls (see [13]) and domains.
•Minkowski domains (MD) : 2mDp, integerm≥1, for 1≤p<2;
•Davis domains (DD) : 2mDp, integerm≥1, forp0>p≥2;
•Chebyshev-Cohn domains (CCD) : 2mDp, integerm≥1, forp≥p0;
Remark 2 Sometimes, when it comes to using pvalues that include scopes
of diﬀerent domains, we will use the term Minkowski domains f or deﬁnitions
of diﬀerent types of domains, specifying name when a speciﬁc pvalue or a
range ofpvalues containing a single type of domains is speciﬁed.
Recall from [13] two propositions:
Proposition 2 IfΛis the critical lattice of the Minkowski ball Dpthan the
sublattice Λ2of index two of the critical lattice is the critical lattice o f2Dp.
Proposition 3 [3, 4]. Thedencityofa (Dp,Λ)-packingisequal to V(Dp)/d(Λ)
and it is maximal if Λis critical for 2Dp.
Proposition 4 Letmbe integer, m≥1. IfΛis the critical lattice of the
ballDpthan the sublattice Λ2mof index2mof the critical lattice is the critical
lattice of 2mDp.
3Proof. Since the Minkowski ball Dpis symmetric about the origin and
convex, then 2mDpis convex and symmetric about the origin by Corollary 1.
When parametrizing admissible lattices Λ having three pairs of points o n
the boundary of the ball Dp, the following parametrization is used [5, 7, 12]:
Λ ={((1+τp)−1
p,τ(1+τp)−1
p),(−(1+σp)−1
p,σ(1+σp)−1
p)}(1)
where
0≤τ <σ,0≤τ≤τp.
τpis deﬁned by the equation 2(1 −τp)p= 1+τp
p,0≤τp<1.
1≤σ≤σp, σp= (2p−1)1
p.
Admissible lattices of the form (1) for 2mdublingMinkowski domains 2mDp
have a representation of the form
Λ2mDp={2m((1+τp)−1
p,2mτ(1+τp)−1
p),(−2m(1+σp)−1
p,2mσ(1+σp)−1
p)}
(2)
Hence the Minkowski-Cohn moduli space for these admissible lattices has
the form
∆(p,σ)2mDp= 22m(τ+σ)(1+τp)−1
p(1+σp)−1
p, (3)
in the same domain
M:∞>p>1,1≤σ≤σp= (2p−1)1
p,
Consequently, the critical determinants of 2mdublingballsDphave a
representation of the form
∆(0)
p(2mDp) = ∆(p,σp)2mDp= 2m−1·σp, σp= (2p−1)1/p,(4)
∆(1)
p(2mDp) = ∆(p,1))2mDp= 4m−1
p1+τp
1−τp,2(1−τp)p= 1+τp
p,0≤τp<1.
(5)
And these are the determinants of the sublattices of index 2mof the critical
lattices of the corresponding balls Dp.
Remark 3 Proposition 4 is a strengthening of Proposition 2 and its ext en-
sion on domains.
4Theorem 2 Theoptimallattice packingofthe Minkowski, Davis, andChe byshev-
Cohn domains is realized with respect to the sublattices of i ndex2mof the
critical lattices
(1,0)∈Λ(0)
p,(−2−1/p,2−1/p)∈Λ(1)
p.
Proof. By Proposition 2 the critical lattice of 2mDpis the sublattice of index
2mof the critical lattice of the ball Dp. So it is the admissible lattice for
2mDpand by Proposition 1 is packing lattice of 2m−1Dp. By Proposition 3
the corresponding lattice packing has maximal density and so is optim al.
3 Inscribed and circumscribed hexagons of
minimum areas
Denote by ∆(2mDp) the critical determinant of the domain 2mDp. By for-
mulas (4,5) we have:
∆(2mDp) =/braceleftBigg
∆(0)
p(2mDp),1≤p≤2, p≥p0,
∆(1)
p(2mDp),2≤p≤p0;(6)
herep0is a real number that is deﬁned unique by conditions ∆( p0,σp) =
∆(p0,1),2,57<p0<2,58, p0≈2.5725
Denoted by Ihma2mDpthe minimal area of hexagons which inscibed in
the domain 2mDpand have three pairs of points on the boundary of 2mDp.
From Theorems 1, 2 and [4] we have
Theorem 3
Ihma2mDp= 3·∆(2mDp).
Respectively denoted by Shma 2mDpthe minimal area of hexagons which
circumscribed to the domain 2mDpand have three pairs of points on the
boundary of 2mDp. From Theorems 1, 2 and [4] we have
Theorem 4
Shma 2mDp= 4·∆(2mDp).
54 Direct systems and direct limits
Various variants of direct systems and direct limits are introduced a nd stud-
ied in [8, 9, 10, 11].
Here we give their simpliﬁed versions suﬃcient for our purposes. Let Xbe
a set. By a binary relation over Xwe understand a subset of the Cartesian
productX×X. By a preorder on Xwe understand a binary relation over
Xthat is reﬂexive and transitive.
Deﬁnition 1 LetN0be the set of natural numbers with zero. A preoder N
onN0is called a directed set if for each pair k,m∈Nthere exists an n∈N
for whichk≤nandm≤n. A subsetN′is coﬁnal in Nif, for each m∈N
their exists an n∈N′such thatm≤n.
Deﬁnition 2 A direct (or inductive) system of sets {X,π}over a directed
setNis a function which attaches to each m∈Na setXm, and to each
pairm,nsuch thatm≤ninN, a mapπn
m:Xm→Xnsuch that, for each
m∈N,πm
m=Id, and form≤n≤kinN,πk
nπn
m=πk
m.
Remark 4 We will consider direct systems of sets, topological spaces , groups
and free Z-modules.
Proposition 5 A directed set Nforms a category with elements are natu-
ral numbers n,m,... with zero and with morphisms m→ndeﬁned by the
relationm≤n. A direct system over Nis a covariant functor from Nto
the category of sets and maps, or to the category of topologic al spaces and
continuous mappins, or to the category of groups and homomor phisms or to
the category of Z-modules and homomorphisms.
Proof. Obviously.
Deﬁnition 3 Let{X,π}and{Y,ψ}be direct systems over MandNre-
spectively. Then a map
Φ :{X,π} → {Y,ψ}
consisting of a map φ:M→N, and for each m∈M, a map
φm:Xm→Yφ(m)
6such that, if m≤ninM, then commutativity holds in the diagram

4.1 Direct systems of Minkowski domains and their

By Pontryagin duality [8] every Banach space considered in its additiv e
structure which is an abelian topological group Gis reﬂexive that means the
existance of topological isomorphism bitween Gand its bidual G∧∧.

and its direct limit is a neighborhood of zero constructed in accordan ce with
the rules for constructing the direct limit of the corresponding dire ct system
of topological spaces. We denote this direct limit by Ddirlim
p.Accordingly, we
denote the direct limit of critical lattices by Λdirlim

74.1.1 Direct systems
We consider the following classes of direct systems of Minkowski balls and
domains and their critical lattices.

Λp2− −− →2Λp2− −− →22Λp2− −− → ···2− −− →2mΛp2− −− → ··· (13)
Below, for brevity, we will denote the balls, domains, and lattices of
Chebyshev-Cohn by CC.
•CC direct systems of balls and domains : intm≥1, forp≥p0;
