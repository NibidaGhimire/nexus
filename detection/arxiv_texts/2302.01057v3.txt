We analytically study nonlinear quasi-monochromatic plas ma waves in a two-dimensional (2D)
electron system (ES) set between the two metal electrodes (g ates). We derive a nonlinear Schr¨ odinger
equation for a slow-varying envelope to describe the waves. We ﬁnd it to be of either focusing or
defocusing type depending on the parameter qd, where qis the carrier wave vector and dis the
distance between the 2DES and the gates. When qd < 1.61, we have the defocusing-type equation
with the solutions in the form of dark plasma solitons appear ing against the background of the
stable plane waves. Conversely, for qd > 1.61, the focusing-type equation has the solutions in the
form of bright solitons, and the plane waves are unstable. We also address the appearance of the
simplest type of breathers in the latter case. A detailed des cription of the resultant nonlinear waves
is given based on the parameters of the two-dimensional elec tron system.
I. INTRODUCTION
Studies ofchargedensity excitations(orplasmawaves)
in low-dimensional systems have been carried on for over
half a century [ 1–5], and they still attract great interest.
For the most part, it is because the 2D plasma waves can
be applied in detecting THz and sub-THz radiation [ 6–
14]. Along with the applied studies, there has been car-
ried out intriguing fundamental research, for example, as
reported in recent papers on plasmon-assisted compres-
sion of light [ 15,16], relativistic plasma waves [ 17–19],
nonlocal 2D plasma excitations [ 20,21], the realization
of the hydrodynamic regime [ 22–24], etc.
Although nonlinear eﬀects in 2DESs, for instance, the
generationofarectiﬁedcurrentduringthepropagationof
monochromatic waves, have been given a rather detailed
consideration, see, for example [ 10], as a rule, they are
examined within the frameworkof a conventionalpertur-
bation theory and/or through an iterative process. How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of the
nonlinear waves themselves have not been studied.
Thus, in this paper, we propose to look at the non-
linear dynamics of quasi-monochromatic plasma waves
from a more basic perspective. The standard method
of describing the evolution of a weakly nonlinear quasi-
monochromatic wave relies on the nonlinear Schr¨ odinger
equation (NLSE) formulated for the slow-varying enve-
lope of the wave. The NLSE can describe a number of
diﬀerent nonlinear waves, like those on the water sur-
face [25], in ﬁber optics [ 26], in Bose-Einstein conden-
sates [27], in modulated structures [ 28], etc. Neverthe-
less, as far as we know, the NLSE for the plasma waves
in a 2DES so far has not been derived and analyzed.
It should be noted, that although the conventional it-
erative method describes suﬃciently well the generation
of high harmonics and the rectiﬁed response of the sys-
tem, this approach does not capture slow variations in
the amplitudes of plasma waves (compared to the period

of the wave, 2 π/ω). Consequently, it cannot adequately
describe the evolution of nonlinear waves on large time
scales. That is why, more accurate approach, called the
multiple scales method, which enables the characteriza-
tion of slow changes in the amplitude of the waves prop-
agating in a system, is employed in the reported study
to derive the NLSE and describe the dynamics of the
envelope of the quasi-monochromatic plasma waves.
In the present work, we deduce and explore the NLSE
for the plasma waves in a 2DES sandwiched between the
two gates, as depicted in the inset of Fig. 1. In regard
to relating the investigated scheme depicted in the inset
to realistic systems, it should be noted that a heavily
doped substrate (separated from the 2D system by the
dielectricwiththethickness d)canactasoneofthegates.
Therefore, real systems would not require creating two
actual metal gates. It would suﬃce to fabricate only
one, while a heavily doped substrate could play the role
of the other.2
It should be noted that throughout the paper, by
2DESs we refer to the semiconductor heterostructures
and quantum wells based primarily on GaAs/AlGaAs
compounds. However, in principle, the phenomena re-
ported in the paper can also be achieved in conducting
2D materials such as graphene, for additional discussion,
please see the end of Sec. V.
We ﬁnd that the NLSE for 2D plasma waves can be
of focusing or defocusing type, as determined by the pa-
rameter qd, withqbeing the carrier wave vector and d
being the distance between the 2DES and the gates. In
particular, qd >1.61 leads to the focusing NLSE with
solutions in the form of bright solitons, in which case the
plasma plane waves are unstable. Otherwise, qd <1.61
resultsinthe defocusingNLSEwith thedarkplasmasoli-
tons as solutions, arising against the background of the
stable plane waves.
Curiously, the NLSE for the water-surface waves has
a similar behavior, with a comparable threshold value of
the analogous parameter qh= 1.363 [29], where qis the
carrier wave vector and his the water depth. In that
case, it deﬁnes the borderline between the shallow-water
(qh <1.363) and deep-water ( qh >1.363) conditions.
II. NONLINEAR SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION
FOR THE PLASMA WAVES IN A 2DES
Consider a 2D system placed between the two ideal
metal gates positioned above and below it, as illustrated
in the inset of Fig. 1. Hence, we look for the waves
that propagate along the x-axis and are uniform along
they-axis. For the analytical description of the plasma
waves in the 2DES, we follow a standard hydrodynamic
approach [ 6,30], which applicability is examined in Sec-
tionIV. The approach is based on using the Euler equa-
tion for the velocity of electron ﬂow v(x,t) and the con-
tinuity equation for the deviation in the electron concen-
trationn(x,t) from its equilibrium value n0along with
the Poisson equation for the potential ϕ(x,t) taken at
the 2DES plane z= 0:
∂tv(x,t)+∂xv2(x,t)

whereκis the dielectric permittivity of the medium be-
tweenthe2DESandthegates, eistheelementarycharge,
andmis the eﬀective mass of electrons. Here, the Pois-
son equation is given in the integral form in terms of the
Green’s function, G(x), of the Laplace operator, with the
boundary conditions of vanishing potential at the gate
surfaces z=±din thexy-plane. The Fourier transform
of the Green’s function, G(q), can be written, as:
G(q) =2π
qtanhqd, (2)the derivation of G(q) is given in Appendix A. Since the
spectrum of the linear plasma waves in a 2DES, ω(q),
is related to G(q) through ω2(q) =e2n0q2G(q)/mκ(see
Appendix A), we arrive at the following expression for
the spectrum [ 31,32]:
ω2(q) =2πe2n0
mκqtanhqd, (3)
whereqis the modulus of the wave vector directed, in
this case, along the x-axis.
To ﬁnd the NLSE for the plasma waves, we solve
the equations in ( 1) employing the multiple scales
method [ 29,33]. Within that framework, the functions
describing the wave are expanded into a series governed
by the small parameter ε:
v(x,t) =∞/summationdisplay
k=1εkvk(x0,x1,x2,...,t0,t1,t2,...),
n(x,t) =∞/summationdisplay
k=1εknk(x0,x1,x2,...,t0,t1,t2,...),
ϕ(x,t) =∞/summationdisplay
k=1εkϕk(x0,x1,x2,...,t0,t1,t2,...).(4)
Here, the parameter εis used to separate diﬀerent orders
of nonlinearity. Namely, the linear response is deﬁned
byv1,ϕ1, andn1, whereas the quadratic response is de-
ﬁned by v2,ϕ2, andn2that contain the rectiﬁed con-
tribution and the contribution of the second harmonic
∝2ω, etc. However, in addition to the rectiﬁcation and
generation of high-order harmonics, the nonlinearities in
Eqs. (1) lead to slow (in the sense that nonlinearity is
relatively small) variation in the amplitudes of the ﬁrst
and other harmonics. This slow variation is described in
the framework of the multiple scales method through the
introduction of (generally speaking, phenomenological)
additional arguments xkandtkfork= 1,2,... Thereby,
diﬀerent arguments in functions vk,ϕk, andnkare used
to distinguish between the fast and slow dynamics of the
quasi-monochromaticwaveunderconsideration. Namely,
the arguments x0andt0describe the fast carrier of the
wave and have the same order as the ”real” xandt. On
the otherhand, the arguments, xkandtk, withk≥1, are
qualitatively of the order of εkxandεkt, describing the
slow evolution of the envelope. In the given framework,
the diﬀerential operators become as follows:
∂x→∂x0+ε∂x1+ε2∂x2+...
∂t→∂t0+ε∂t1+ε2∂t2+...(5)
Applying the multiple scales method to the ﬁrst two
equations in ( 1) using Eqs. ( 4) and (5) is fairly straight-
forward. However, as for the Poissonequation, the appli-
cation of the method needs more detailed consideration,
which is given in Appendix B.
The essential idea of the multiple scales method is suc-
cessively setting to zero the coeﬃcients of the powers of3
the small parameter ε, i.e.ε,ε2,ε3, and so on, which
leads to a series of equations for vk,nk, andϕk. Hence,
by substituting Eqs. ( 4), (B3), and (B4) into the ﬁrst
two expressions in ( 1) and Eq. ( B2), respectively, we ob-
tain the desired set of equations for vk,nk, andϕk. A
detailed application of the method is given in the Ap-
pendixC, while below only the main relations are given.

sponds to the case of linear waves, and looking for the

not depend on the ‘fast’ variables x0andt0, we arrive at:

2πe2n0d/mκis the velocity of the linear
plasma waves ( 3) in the long-wavelength limit qd≪1,
θ=qx0−ωt0, andG0(q) = tanh( qd)/qd. To satisfy
Eq. (7), the expression in brackets must be equal to zero.
Therefore, as expected, Eq. ( 7) relates ωandq, i.e. it
leads to the dispersion relation ( 3) for linear plasmons in
a 2DES.
Now, let us proceed to the equations that follow from
the vanishing of the coeﬃcient of ε2, which are given in
Appendix C, see Eqs. ( C3). The key point here is that
in the framework of the multiple scales method, all the
corrections n2,n3,...shouldbeﬁnite, withoutunbounded
growth at t0→ ±∞orx0→ ±∞, that is why no ’reso-
nant’ (secular) terms ∝exp(iθ) areexpected in the right-
hand side of the equation for corrections n2,n3,...
Hence, setting to zero the coeﬃcient of the term ∝
exp(iθ) in the right-hand side of the equation for n2, see
Eq. (C4) in Appendix C, resultsin the followingequation
for the envelope A:
∂t1A+vgr∂x1A= 0, (8)
wherevgr=∂ω/∂qis thegroupvelocityofplasmawaves.
Theobtainedequationclearlyindicatesthat theenvelope
propagates with group velocity, as expected.
Last, we derive the equations that follow from the van-
ishingofthecoeﬃcientof ε3inEqs.(1)and(B2)afterthe
substitution of ( 4), (B3) and (B4), which are included as
Eqs. (C10) in Appendix C. Setting to zero the coeﬃcient
of the secular term ∝exp(iθ) in the right-hand side of
the equation for the correction n3(C13) yields the NLSE
of the following form:

2DES (3),G0(q) corresponds to the Fourier transform of

∂vgr/∂qdescribes the change in the group velocity with
the wave vector q. Also, according to ( 6), the amplitude
of the concentration deviation, n1, equals 2 |A|.
Finally, Eq.( 9)canberewritteninamoreconventional
form. We make the transition to the frame of reference
moving with the group velocity, vgr, and introduce the
variables T=t2andX=x1−vgrt1(as well as X2=
x2−vgrt2). As a result, in addition to the fact that
Eq. (8) is fulﬁlled, the NLSE appears as:

eterqdis plotted in Fig. 1, clearly indicating the critical
pointqd≈1.61 where βchanges its sign, which is crucial
for the type of the NLSE solutions.
On the whole, the resultant NLSE ( 11) describes a va-
rietyof nonlinearquasi-monochromaticwavesin a 2DES.
In the present study, we focus in particular on a few ba-
sic phenomena that we ﬁnd most interesting, namely, the
plane wave stability, the ’dark’ and ’bright’ solitons, and
the simplest type of breathers. These issues are consid-
ered in the next Section.
III. NLSE SOLUTIONS
A. The ’shallow’ case of qd < 1.61
It has been shown that the stability of plane waves
is determined by the sign of the product ωqqβ[34–37].
Namely, a plane wave is stable provided that ωqqβ <0,
otherwise, when ωqqβ >0, the plane wave is unstable
due to the long-wavelength perturbations. In the case
of the plasma waves in a 2DES, ωqqis always negative,
as follows from Eq. ( 3). Therefore, the stability of plane
waves depends solely on the coeﬃcient βin (10). As
indicated in Fig. 1, we ﬁnd βto be positive for qd <1.61,
which leads to stable plane waves.
In that case, the so-called dark solitons can appear
against the plane-wave background, manifested as the
vanishing of the envelope function A. Since such solitons
arerelativelywellestablishedtheoretically[ 38,39]andby
experiment [ 27,40–46], only the major ﬁndings concern-
ing them are reported in this paper. To begin with, we
seekthe solutionsin the formof A=aexp(iφ), wherethe
amplitude a=a(X−UT)andphase φ=φ(X−VT)have
the respective velocities UandV. The fact that Uand
Vare diﬀerent distinguishes NLSE solitons from the con-
ventional ones described, for instance, by Korteweg–De
Vries equation [ 47,48]. After the substitution of aandφ4

teristic envelope 2 |A|/n0for the bright soliton ( 14), plotted

The proﬁle of the given soliton is shown in Fig. 2(a). It
is also worth mentioning that the soliton under consid-
eration is the simplest case in the whole family of gray
solitons [ 38,46].
B. The ’deep’ case of qd > 1.61
When the coeﬃcient βis negative, the plane waves are
unstableduetothelong-wavelengthperturbations,which
isanalogoustotheBenjamin-Feirinstabilityofthewater-
surface wavesspeciﬁed by the ’deep water’ condition [ 34–
37]. In this caseof qd >1.61, the so-calledbrightsolitons
emerge. Unlike dark solitons, they can be formed, for
example, as a result of the development of plane wave
instability. As the solitons have been reviewed in detailin the literature [ 49–51], here we include only the ﬁnal
expressions pertaining to our study. Hence, considering
the solutions in the form of A=aexp(iφ), withaand
φintroduced as in the previous subsection, leads to the
following equation for the envelope function:
A=abexp(iU(X−VT)/|ωqq|)

U(U−2V)/|ωqq|/parenrightBig,(14)
where the amplitude abis deﬁned as:

In this case, it should be noted that bright solitons exist
onlyifthe condition U >2Vis satisﬁed. Atypicalproﬁle
of the bright soliton is shown in Fig. 2(b).
As the ﬁnal step, we address the NLSE and some of its
solutionsin the limit qd→ ∞, i.e. for the ungated 2DES.
After the introduction of the dimensionless variables:
T=−ωT
8,X=qX,A=√
6A
n0,(16)
the given NLSE ( 11) takes a standard form:
i∂TA+∂2
XA+2|A|2A= 0. (17)
This equation has several interesting solutions includ-
ing the ones like the Akhmediev breather [ 52] and the
Kuznetsov-Ma breather [ 53,54]. In the present work,
however, we consider a special type of solution called the
Peregrine soliton [ 55]. Not only is it localized in space,
as an ordinary soliton, but also in time, having just one
pronounced maximum in its time-waveform. Hence, the
solution to Eq. ( 17) can be written as:
A=/parenleftBigg
1−4+16iT2
1+4X2+16T2/parenrightBigg
exp(2iT).(18)
We note that alongwith the Peregrinesoliton, thereexist
a whole series of space-time localized solutions [ 56–58].
Also, while the solution in ( 18) is given for the unity
amplitude, it can be modiﬁed for the amplitude A0by
making the substitutions A→A/A0,X→XA0, and
T→TA2
0, which does not change the NLSE ( 17).
It should be stressed that although the NLSE solu-
tionsmayseemexotic, overall,theyproperlydescribethe
wavesin actual physicalsystems. Forinstance, the above
mentionedPeregrinebreathershavebeenobservedexper-
imentally in ﬁber optics [ 59,60], on a water surface [ 61],
and in multicomponent plasma [ 62]. This gives grounds
to believe that the results considered in this section are
relevant for real 2DESs.
IV. APPLICABILITY OF THE
HYDRODYNAMIC APPROACH
First of all, it should be mentioned that semiconductor
heterostructures and quantum wells, primarily, based on5
GaAs/AlGaAs compounds, are implied by 2DESs in the
following discussion.
Now let us consider the applicability of the the hydro-
dynamic approach, which is used to describe the electron
dynamics, see the ﬁrst equation in ( 1). This approach
is applicable provided that the time of electron-electron
collisions, τee, is less than the electron relaxation time
due to collisions with impurities and phonons, τip. The
typical values of τeeandτip(as well as the kinematic vis-
cosity,ν, and the electron mobility, µ) for GaAs/AlGaAs
quantum wells are given in Table I. In the table, τeeand
νare estimated for the case of the degenerate system as
follows (see, for example, Refs. [ 63,64]):
τee=¯hEf
(kBT)2, ν=1
4v2
fτee, (19)
whereEf=mv2
f/2 andvf= ¯h√2πn0/mdenote the
Fermi energy and velocity, the spin and valley degener-
acy factors were taken equal two and one, n0is the equi-
librium electron concentration, and νis the kinematic
viscosity. The estimates of τeelisted in the table are
obtained for the eﬀective mass of electrons in AlGaAs
quantum wells m= 0.066m0, withm0being the mass of
a free electron, at a typical concentration n0= 5·1011
cm−2, leading to the Fermi velocity vf= 3.1·107cm/s
and energy Ef= 18 meV. It should be noted that the
results of experimental studies of viscosity ν[64] are in
agreementwiththetheoreticalestimationsbasedon( 19).
TableIalso includes typical values of the electron mo-
bilityµin AlGaAs quantum wells established in the liter-
ature [65], while the relaxationtime τipis estimated from
the relation with the mobility: τip=µm/e. (It should be
noted here that certainly in modern AlGaAs heterostruc-
tures the electron mobility can be larger than typical val-
ues presented in Table I, see, for example, Ref. [ 66]).
Table I. Typical values of the mean time of the electron-
electron collisions τee, the time of electron collisions with im-
purities and phonons τip, the kinematic viscosity ν, and the
electron mobility µ, are given for the case of 2DESs based
on GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. In estimations of τeeandν
(19) it was assumed that the concentration has the value of
5·1011cm−2.
µ, cm2/(V·s)τipτeeν, cm2/s
T=4 K 10638 ps 100 ps 2.4·104
T=77 K 2·1057.5 ps 0.27 ps 64
Thus, the condition of τee≪τipis satisﬁed at temper-
atures near T= 77 K, while it is violated for AlGaAs
quantum wells at the liquid-helium temperature.
In the case of plasma waves with a ﬁnite frequency
ω, we have to consider another condition for the valid-
ity of the hydrodynamic approach, namely, ωτee≪1
(see, for example, the conclusion section in Ref [ 67]). It
means that the average time of electron-electron colli-
sions should be much less than the period of plasma os-
cillations. Hence, this condition imposes the following
restriction on frequency: f=ω/(2π)≪(2πτee)−1≈0.6THz atT= 77 K, where the value of τeeis taken from
TableI.
In addition, for the considered plasma waves, we ne-
glected the ’collisional’ damping due to the ﬁnite value of
τip, usually described by the term v/τipin the left-hand
sideofthe ﬁrst equationin ( 1). Indeed, this damping fac-
tor can be ignored provided that ωτip≫1. Hence, given
thatτip= 7.5 ps atT= 77 K, we obtain the constraint
condition: f=ω/(2π)≫(2πτip)−1≈20 GHz.
Therefore, the indicated approach is applicable as long
as the frequency ωsatisﬁes the requirement of τ−1
ip≪
ω≪τ−1
ee. For a 2DES with the abovementioned param-
eters, at the liquid-nitrogen temperature, this limitation
corresponds to the frequency range between 20 GHz and
0.6 THz.
Furthermore, in the right-hand side of the ﬁrst equa-
tion in ( 1), we also neglect the electronic pressure and
viscosity terms, appearing as −3
4v2
f∂xn(x,t)/n0(see, for
example, Ref. [ 68]) andν∆v, respectively. Indeed, the
electronic pressure becomes signiﬁcant in plasma waves
at large wave vectors (at a large charge density gradient)
of the plasmons — qualitatively, at q≈kF, wherekFis
the Fermi wave vector. However, the study assumes the
’classical’ limit of q≪kF, that is why the pressure can
be neglected.
Concerning the viscosity it should be mentioned that,
on the whole, it can be neglected provided that the
Reynolds number, Re, is much greater than unity. Con-
sidering the estimate of Re≈λv/ν, whereλis the wave-
length of the plasma wave, let us evaluate Reat the plas-
monfrequency f= 200GHz. Accordingtothedispersion
equation ( 3), this frequency corresponds to the plasmon
wavelength of λ≈10µm, which is a typical value for
the usual parameters n0= 5·1011cm−2,m= 0.066m0,
the distance between the 2DES and the gate, d= 400
nm, and the dielectric permittivity of GaAs κ= 12.8.
The typical value of viscosity νat 77 K is 64 cm2/s (Ta-
bleI). Therefore, a velocity v= 5·105cm/s can result in
Re≈λv/ν≈8. Here, it should be noted that, in princi-
ple, the velocity in a 2DES can reach 107cm/s, see, for
instance, Ref. [ 69,70]. Thus, in principle, the Reynolds
number can exceed the value of one.
Since the viscosity term appears in the right-hand
side of the ﬁrst equation in ( 1) asν∆v, qualitatively,
viscosity leads to the damping of plasma waves with
the characteristic rate of νq2, where qis the plasmon
wave vector. Hence, for the aforementioned parameters,
νq2=ν(2π/λ)2≈2.5·109s−1, which is insigniﬁcant
compared to the typical frequency of the given plasma
wave of the order of 100 GHz. Therefore, viscosity has a
negligible eﬀect on the plasma waves in the system.
To summarize, the study relies on two main assump-
tions: (i) the classical limit of q≪kF(ω≪EF/¯h) and
(ii) the hydrodynamic limit, requiring τ−1
ip≪ω≪τ−1
ee
and a large Reynolds number, Re≈λv/ν.
Before proceeding, we note that on the whole, the con-
sidered waves are the nonlinear generalization of linear
2D plasmons in the hydrodynamic regime ωτee≪1.6
V. ESTIMATIONS OF PLASMA WAVE
PARAMETERS FOR REALISTIC 2DES
Thus, the possible experimental study of the consid-
ered plasma waves can be set up using GaAs/AlGaAs
quantum wells (since in such structures, the electron
relaxation time due to collisions with impurities and
phonons is large) at or near the liquid-nitrogen temper-
ature of 77 K for the plasma frequencies on the order
of 50 – 300 GHz (higher frequencies may be used at
a shorter relaxation time due to electron-electron colli-
sions). The experimental investigation probably should
be started with the measurements of the waves in the
ungated 2DESs or systems with large d. In such sys-
tems, the plasmon wavelength is larger than in gated
ones. For example, for the parameters mentioned above
(the concentration n0= 5·1011cm−2, the eﬀective mass
m= 0.066m0, and the dielectric permittivity of GaAs
κ= 12.8), at the frequency f= 200 GHz, the wave-
length becomes on the order of λ= 35µm. In that case,
the Reynolds number Re≈λv/νequals 5.5 (see Table I
for typical ν= 64 cm2/s) for the adequate velocity of
electron ﬂow, v= 105cm/s, which leads to the current
densityj=en0v= 0.8 A/m. However, likely the lat-
ter condition is not very strict. For instance, a ﬁvefold
smaller velocity v= 2·104cm/s and the current den-
sityj=en0v= 0.16 A/m will result in the Reynolds
number on the order of 1. It means that qualitatively,
the obtained by the analytical (hydrodynamic) approach
results will still be applicable, although in this case the
inﬂuence of viscosity may certainly require more detailed
consideration.
Concerning the separation distance, d, note that it can
vary over a fairly wide range, roughly from a relatively
small distance of 0.5 µm [11] to a large distance of 500
µm [18]. Let us qualitatively characterize below solitons
in the both cases.
For a large distance, d= 300µm, given typical fre-
quencies of plasma waves within 50–300 GHz, the plas-
mon wavelength, λ= 2π/q, ranges from 600 µm down to
17µm, resulting in the values of qdfrom 3 to 113. Since
in this case qd >1.61, bright solitons can appear in the
2D system. An example of the bright soliton proﬁle is
shown in Fig. 2b. Considering the above-mentioned pa-
rameters at q= 5/d(given the rest of the parameters as
indicated in the caption to Fig. 2b), Eqs. (14) and (15)
yield the soliton localization length of approximately 4 d
andthe amplitude of0 .4n0. Hereit shouldbe noted, that
the excitation and detection of solitons likely require the
use of ohmic or capacitive side contacts to 2DES, so the
distance between the contacts (together with the lateral
size of the real 2D system) should certainly exceed the
localization length (in our case 4 d= 1.2 mm). 2D sys-
tems of such lateral size are indeed practically feasible.
In Ref. [71], for instance, plasmons were experimentally
studied in 2D disks (based on GaAs/AlGaAs quantum
wells) as large as 1 cm in diameter.
As for the solitons in a gated 2D system, with smallseparation between the 2DES and the gates, d= 1µm,
for the same frequency span of 50 to 300 GHz, the plas-
mon wavelength ranges from 61 µm down to 9.5 µm. In
this case, the values of the parameter qdfall between 0.1
and 0.66, resulting in the dark solitons that should arise
in the system at qd <1.61. A typical proﬁle of these soli-
tons is shown in Fig. 2a. Thus, considering, for example,
a soliton with q= 0.6/d(given the rest of the parameters
as speciﬁed in the caption to Fig. 2a), Eqs. (12) and (13)
lead to the soliton length of approximately 20 d= 20µm
and the amplitude of 0 .1n0. A soliton with such param-
eters seems to be quite realizable experimentally.
Thus, the above estimates show that the considered
plasma waves can exist in realistic 2DESs based on
GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells.
As for the types of 2D systems beyond those involving
quantum wells, graphene-based systems seem the most
promising. Foronething,itiswell-knownthatthehydro-
dynamic regime for the electron motion can be achieved
in graphene [ 72–74]. Besides, the graphene-based struc-
tures with two gates are technically feasible and are
frequently studied, for example, in the case of bilayer
graphene (see, for instance, Ref. [ 75], note that in this
reference the doped Si substrate acts as one of the gates).
These reasons make graphene-based systems a good can-
didate for the possible investigation of the plasma waves
considered in the paper.
VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Concerningthe NLSE derivation by the multiple scales
method mentiononceagainthatthe corrections n2,n3,...
in(4)shouldbeﬁnite. However,theexpressionfor n2has
the denominator G0(q)−G0(2q), which vanishes in the
limiting case qd→0, see Eqs. ( C5) and (C6). The rea-
son is that the plasmon dispersion ( 3) becomes linear for
qd→0. In this case, the condition ω(2q) = 2ω(q) is sat-
isﬁed, correspondingtothe resonantsecondharmonicex-
citation, which is certainly beyond the application range
of the NLSE. Qualitatively, the more nonlinear the dis-
persion is, the better the NLSE describes the behavior of
the waves.
At the end it should be noted that the separation dis-
tances between the 2DES and the top and bottom gates
do not necessarily have to be identical. The results re-
ported in the paper are qualitatively valid regardless of
the slight variation in the distances separating the 2DES
and the top and bottom gates. However, in that case,
the Poisson equation in ( 1) becomes rather intricate and
cumbersome, and its analysis is beyond the scope of the
paper. If necessary, this equation can be examined else-
where, see, for example, Ref. [ 30].
To conclude, we have examined the nonlinear dynam-
ics of quasi-monochromatic plasma waves in a 2DES
placed between the two ideal metal gates. Employing
the method of multiple scales, we derived the nonlinear
Schr¨ odinger equation (NLSE) governing the evolution of7
the slow-varying envelope of the waves. We found the
NLSE solutions to be distinctly diﬀerent depending on
theparameter qd, whereqisthecarrierwavevectorand d
is the distance between the 2DES and the gates. Namely,
whenqd <1.61,the planewavesarestableandthe NLSE
solutions are dark solitons emerging against the plane-
wave background. On the other hand, for qd >1.61,
the plane waves are unstable due to the long-wavelength
perturbations and the NLSE has bright-soliton solutions.
The discovered phenomenon is remarkably similar to the
behavior of water-surface waves [ 29], where the condi-
tions of shallow and deep water are distinguished based
on whether the parameter qh(withhbeing the water
depth) is below or above the critical value of 1 .363. We
provide explicit NLSE solutions for the cases of dark and
bright solitons as well as for the Peregrine breather, a
peculiar space-time localized wave with a single maxi-
mum. We believe that the waves reported in the paper
can be excited and detected in a real 2DESs based on
the GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells with side contacts at
liquid nitrogen temperatures and frequencies of the order
of 50 – 300 GHz.

Appendix A: Derivation of the Green’s function G(q)
Given a 2DES placed between two ideal metal gates,
as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1, consider the Pois-
son equation relating the electron density in the 2DES,
ρ(x,y,t), and the electric potential, ϕ(x,y,z,t):
−∆ϕ(x,y,z,t) =4π
κρ(x,y,t)δ(z),(A1)
wherexandyare coordinates in 2DES plane, z-axis is
perpendicular to 2DES plane as shown in the inset of
Fig.1,tdesignates time, and κis the dielectric permit-
tivity between the 2DES and the gates. Here 2DES is
assumed to be δ-thin. Taking the Fourier transform of
this equation with respect to xandtyieldsϕandρas
functions of the wave vector qand the frequency ω. We
note that in this case, the solutions are homogeneous
along the y-axis, i.e. the wave vector is directed along
thex-axis. Therefore, Eq. ( A1) becomes:
(−∂2
z+q2)ϕ(q,z,ω) =4π
κρ(q,ω)δ(z).(A2)
This diﬀerential equation is solved for the following
boundary conditions along the z-coordinate: (i) the plas-
mon potential ϕ(q,z,ω) has to vanish at the surfacesof the ideal metal gates, i.e. ϕ(q,z=±d,ω) = 0, (ii)
ϕ(q,z,ω) has to be continuous at the location of the
2DES plane ( z= 0), and (iii) the partial derivative
∂zϕ(q,z,ω) atz= 0 has to satisfy the equation below,
obtained by integrating Eq. ( A2) across the point z= 0:
∂zϕ(q,z,ω)|z=+0
z=−0=−4π
κρ(q,ω).(A3)
From the boundary conditions (i) and (ii), we ﬁnd the
solution for the potential ϕ(z) of the form:
ϕ(q,z,ω) =ϕ(q,z= 0,ω)sinh(q(d−|z|))
sinh(qd).(A4)
Finally, using the third boundary condition in ( A3) for
the derivative ∂zϕ(q,z,ω) atz= 0, we arrive at:
ϕ(q,z= 0,ω) =2πρ(q,ω)
qκtanh(qd).(A5)
After applying the inverse Fourier transformation, the
above equation becomes the 3rd equation in ( 1), where
theplasmonchargedensityisrelatedtotheconcentration
asρ(x,t) =−en(x,t), where eis the elementary charge
(e >0). We also note that function G(q) in Eq. ( 2)
relatesϕ(q,z= 0,ω) andρ(q,ω)/κ, therefore it is given
asG(q) = 2πtanh(qd)/q.
Todetermine the spectrum oflinearplasmons, the ﬁrst
two expressions in ( 1) need to be linearized. Hence, their
Fourier transformation leads to:
−iωv(q,ω) =iqe
mϕ(q,z= 0,ω),
−iωρ(q,ω)−iqen0v(q,ω) = 0,(A6)
wherev(q,ω) is the Fourier transform of the velocity of
the electron ﬂow, mis the eﬀective mass of electrons,
andn0is the equilibrium concentration of electrons in
2DES. Using these equations along with ( A5), we ﬁnd
the dispersion law given by Eq. ( 3).
Here it is worth stressing the fundamental diﬀerence
between plasmons in 3D and 2D systems. In the former
case the plasmon frequency, ω3D, in the long wavelength
limit, is independent of the value of the wave vector q:
ω3D=/radicalbig
4πe2n3D/m, wheren3Dis the 3D concentra-
tion of electrons. In contrast, the frequency of plasmons
in a 2D system ( 3) strongly depends on the wave vec-
torq. Such a diﬀerence between the dispersions can be
qualitatively explained as follows. Roughly speaking, 3D
plasmons can be viewed as oscillations of positively and
negatively charged planes. The electric ﬁeld between the
planes, corresponding to the restoring force, is indepen-
dent of the distance between the planes. For this reason,
the frequency of 3D plasmons is unrelated to the wave
vector. As opposed to the charged planes, 2D plasmons
(in a 2DES without the gates) can be treated as oscil-
lations of charged ’wires’. In this case, the electric ﬁeld
between the wires and the restoring force behave as 1 /r,
whereris the distance between the wires. Hence, strong8
dependence of the frequency on the wave vector appears
in the dispersion law of 2D plasmons ( 3).
In the case of a gated 2DES, at qd≪1 (where dis the
distance between the 2DES and the gates), the Coulomb
interaction between electrons in the 2DES is weakened
due to the appearance of so-called image charges in the
gates. As a result, the square-root plasmon spectrum in
ungated2DESis‘softened’, exhibitinglineardependence:
ωgated(q) =vpq, with the velocity vp=/radicalbig
2πe2n0d/(mκ).
Appendix B: Explicit expressions for M0,1,2andL0,1,2
Let us write down the Fourier-transformed Poisson
equation ( A5) in the following way:
ϕ(q,t)cosh(qd) =−2πed
κn(q,t)sinhqd
qd.(B1)
Then, we can expand cosh( qd) and sinh( qd)/qdinto Tay-
lor series. Note that these serieshave an inﬁnite radiusof
convergence with respect to qdand include only the even
powers of qd. Hence, after the inverse Fourier transfor-
mation, as q2-terms become −∂2
xoperators, we obtain:
/hatwiderMϕ(x,t) =−2πed
κ/hatwideLn(x,t), (B2)
where the diﬀerential operators, /hatwiderMand/hatwideL, are given as:
/hatwiderM=∞/summationdisplay
j=0(−1)jd2j∂2j
x
(2j)!,/hatwideL=∞/summationdisplay
j=0(−1)jd2j∂2j
x
(2j+1)!.(B3)
Next, based on Eqs. ( 5) and (B3), we can determine
the expansions for /hatwiderMand/hatwideLin theε-series as follows:
/hatwiderM=/hatwiderM0+ε/hatwiderM1+ε2/hatwiderM2+...,
/hatwideL=/hatwideL0+ε/hatwideL1+ε2/hatwideL2+...(B4)
To determine the operators /hatwiderM0,1,...and/hatwideL0,1,...in the
expansions( B4), it is convenientto use the Fouriertrans-
formations. Hence, in L(q) = sinh( qd)/qdandM(q) =
cosh(qd), the argument qcan be expressed by the series
q0+εq1+ε2q2+..., corresponding to the substitution in
(5). Then, we can expand these functions into the Taylor
series and extract the coeﬃcients of the diﬀerent pow-
ers ofε, thereby ﬁnding M0,1,..(qk) andL0,1,..(qk) (with
k= 0,1,...) — the Fourier transforms of the desired op-
erators in ( B4). As a result, for example, M0,1,2(qk) andL0,1,2(qk) can be written explicitly as follows:
M0= cosh(q0d),
M1=q1dsinh(q0d),
M2=q2dsinh(q0d)+q2
1d2
2cosh(q0d),
L0= sinh(q0d)/q0d,

Finally, to obtain the operators /hatwiderM0,1,2and/hatwideL0,1,2,
we can expand the expressions in ( B5) into the Tay-
lor series and make the substitution qk→ −i∂xk, where
k= 0,1,2,....
Note that/hatwiderM0and/hatwideL0above have the simple form of
the operators in ( B3), with∂xreplaced by ∂x0.
Appendix C: Explicit forms of the key equations
Retaining in ( 1) and (B2) only terms proportional to
ε, we arrive at:


∂t0v1−∂x0ϕ1= 0
∂t0n1+n0∂x0v1= 0

wherevp=/radicalbig
2πe2n0d/(mκ) is the velocity of the linear
plasma waves ( 3) in the long-wavelength limit qd≪1
andϕ=eϕ/mis introduced to simplify the form of the
equations. Here, v1andϕ1in (C1) can be eliminated by
expressing them in terms of n1, resulting in:
/parenleftBig
−/hatwiderM0∂2
t0+v2
p∂2
x0/hatwideL0/parenrightBig
n1= 0, (C2)
which after the substitution ( 6) leads to Eq. ( 7). Also, it
is straightforward to determine v1andϕ1from Eq. ( C1)
asv1=ωn1/(qn0) andϕ1=−ω2n1/(q2n0).
Now, let us proceed to the equations that follow from
the vanishing of the coeﬃcient of ε2in Eqs. (1) and (B2).
Thus, after the substitution of the expressions from ( 4),
(B3) and (B4), we obtain:


∂t0v2+∂t1v1−∂x0ϕ2−∂x1ϕ1+1

(C4)
The main point of the multiple scales method is that all
the corrections n2,n3,...should be ﬁnite, without un-
bounded growth at t0→ ±∞ orx0→ ±∞. That
is why no ’resonant’ (secular) terms ∝exp(iθ), where
θ=qx0−ωt0, are expected in the right-hand side of the
equation for corrections. Namely, setting to zero the co-
eﬃcient of the term ∝exp(iθ) in the right-hand side of
Eq. (C4), one can obtain Eq. ( 8).
Then, we consider n2of the form:
n2=C+Dexp(2iθ)+D∗exp(−2iθ),(C5)
where coeﬃcients CandDare the functions of only the
slow variables x1,x2,t1,t2and so on, and Chas a real
value. Consequently, n2has the ’constant’ and the sec-
ond harmonic terms. It is also assumed that n2has no
eigen contribution ∝exp(iθ), more details on the issue
are given below, after Eqs. ( C7) and (C9). TheDcoef-
ﬁcient can be found by introducing the relation in ( C5)
into Eq. ( C4) as follows:
D=3A2
2n0G0(q)
G0(q)−G0(2q),whereG0(q) =tanhqd
qd.
(C6)Although the coeﬃcient Ccannot be determined from
the equations for ε2, it will be deﬁned based on the equa-
tions for ε3as discussed below.
Along with the desired type of n2in (C5), we consider
v2andϕ2of the following forms:
v2=Cv+Bvexp(iθ)+Dvexp(2iθ)+c.c.,
ϕ2=Cϕ+Bϕexp(iθ)+Dϕexp(2iθ)+c.c.,(C7)
whereCvas well as Cϕhave real values and all the coef-
ﬁcients depend only on the slow variables, x1,x2,t1,t2,
and so on. It should be noted that v2andϕ2above may
have a contribution ∝exp(iθ).
By introducing the expressions in ( C7) into Eqs. ( C3)
and using the deﬁnition of the coeﬃcient Din Eq. (C6),
we arrive at:
Dv=ωA2
qn2
0G0(q)/2+G0(2q)
G0(q)−G0(2q),
Dϕ=−ω2A2
q2n2

Bϕ=−2iω

.(C9)
Now, adding an ’eigen’ term Bexp(iθ) (with an arbitrary
value of amplitude B) ton2(C5) leads to extra contri-
butions to BvandBϕin the forms of ωB/(qn0) and
−ω2B/(q2n0), respectively. We also note that from the
equation for ε3below, an expression analogousto Eq. ( 8)
can be obtained for the coeﬃcient B.
The equations corresponding to the vanishing of the
coeﬃcients at ε3can be written as:



Extracting the slow terms, that do not depend on x0andt0, in the ﬁrst two equations in ( C10) and in the third
equation in ( C3) yields the following expressions involving the coeﬃcients C,Cv, andCϕ:

Finally, setting to zero the coeﬃcient of the secular term ∝exp(iqx0−iωt0) in the right-hand side of the above
