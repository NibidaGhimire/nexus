POLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES
OF SOLVABILITY
VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
Abstract. Recently Brownawell and the second author proved a “non-degenerate” case
of the (unproved) “Zilber Nullstellensatz” in connexion with “Strong Exponential Closure”.
Here we treat some significant new cases. In particular these settle completely the problem
of solving polynomial-exponential equations in two complex variables. The methods of
proof are also new, as is the consequence, for example, that there are infinitely many
complex zwith ez+e1/z= 1.
1.Introduction
In a recent paper [  5  ] Brownawell and the second author proved a result in connexion
with Zilber’s “Strong Exponential Closure Axiom” for “pseudoexponential fields”. Over C,
this axiom becomes a conjecture, and it is formulated for irreducible algebraic varieties Vin
Cn×C∗n. Its non-strong form, mentioned by Zilber [  27  , Corollary 4.5, p. 83] in connexion
withCexp(see also Bays and Kirby [  4  , pp. 495 and 538, 539] on “exponential-algebraic
closure”), states that if Vis “normal” (or ex-normal) and “free” (see later for discussions
of these concepts) then Vhas a point of the shape
(1.1) (X1,...,Xn,ˆX1,..., ˆXn) = (z1,...,zn,ez1,...,ezn).
This shape makes evident the connexion with Schanuel’s Conjecture (see [  14  ] and Zilber
[  26  ] for much more, as well as the work [  16  ] of the first author and also the more recent
papers [  7  ,  8  ] of D’Aquino, Fornasiero and Terzo).
Proposition 2 of [  5  , p. 448] proves the existence of (  1.1  )with these two hypotheses on
Vreplaced by a single one. Denote by πthe projection from Cn×C∗ntoCn. Then if
(the Zariski closure) of π(V)has dimension n, there is always such a point (  1.1  ). This
single hypothesis implies that Vis normal (but not that Vis free). We remark that the
Proposition as stated in [  5  ] appears to require that Vhas dimension n; however if the
dimension is n′>nthen life just gets simpler and we can adjoin n′−nsuitably chosen

equations ˆXi= 1. Forn= 1the Proposition seems to be reasonably well-known; see for
example Marker [  17  ] (or Henson and Rubel [  13  ] earlier). But already for n= 2it was new.
Our main purpose in this paper is to relax the condition that dimπ(V) =n. We may
note that if this dimension is 0, then π(V)is a single point (z1,...,zn)and now the
existence of (  1.1  ) is obvious, provided Vitself has dimension at least n.
Our main result concerns the case dimπ(V) = 1. Here too it is reasonable to assume
thatVhas dimension at least n: for example, it is not difficult to prove that if Lis a line
inCnandKis a translate of a group subvariety of Gn
m=C∗nof dimension n−2, both
generic in a perfectly explicit sense, then L×Kcontains no point (  1.1  ).
However there are more subtle obstructions to solvability. A simple example is Vdefined
inC2×C∗2by
(1.2) X1+X2= 1,ˆX1ˆX2= 1.
because ifz1+z2= 1thenez1ez2=e̸= 1. There are similar examples with X1+X2= 1
replaced by
(1.3) m1X1+m2X2=c
for any complex cand integers m1,m2not both zero. One can build analogous examples
inCn×C∗nwhereπ(V)is contained in the hyperplane defined by
(1.4) m1X1+···+mnXn=c.
It turns out that this is essentially the only obstruction under our new assumption. Thus
we shall prove the following result.
Theorem 1.1.SupposeVis an irreducible algebraic variety in Cn×C∗n, of dimension
at leastn, such that the Zariski closure of π(V)inCnhas dimension 1. If (  1.4  )does not
hold onVwith any complex cand any integers m1,...,mnnot all zero, then Vcontains a
point(  1.1  ).
Forn= 1this reduces again to the result in [  17  ]; but already for n= 2it is again new.
Note that the absence of relations (  1.4  )is what Zilber calls “free of additive dependencies
(over C)” [  27  , p. 74]. When an obstruction (  1.4  )does arise, one can recover further
information inductively by means of “back-substitution”.
For example in C2×C∗2withVdefined by
(1.5) X1+X2= 1, X 1X2=ˆX1+ˆX2
any point (  1.1  )onVmust lie on ˆX1ˆX2=e, thus we can eliminate X2,ˆX2to get down to
(1.6) ˆX2
1+e=X1ˆX1(1−X1)
inC×C∗.POLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES OF SOLVABILITY 3
In Theorem  1.1  we focus on the existence of a single point (  1.1  ), but our proof gives
rather more, as was the case in [  5  ]. From the viewpoint of exponential polynomials it
is natural to consider just the projections (z1,...,zn), although we will mention another
possibility later. In [  5  ] we remarked that the set of all such projections is not only infinite
but even Zariski dense in Cn(which isπ(V)there). This was proved by a simple trick
(see later); unfortunately that does not work in our situation if n>1. Nevertheless our
method of proof shows that the set of (z1,...,zn)is indeed infinite and therefore Zariski
dense in the curve π(V).
In fact forn= 1the known results already lead to a fairly explicit description of the set
Z=ZCof points (  1.1  )on an irreducible curve CinC×C∗based only on the geometry of
C. Namely, if dimπ(C) = 0, thenπ(Z)is a single point, while if dimπ(C) = 1, thenπ(Z)
is infinite, hence Zariski dense in π(C).
Now forn= 2we can combine Theorem  1.1  with back-substitution and [  5  ] to give a
conclusive result for π(Z)and surfacesSinC2×C∗2(we remind the reader that Schanuel’s
Conjecture itself remains unknown for n= 2). To state this the following notation will be
useful.
If the Zariski closure of π(S)is a lineLas in(  1.3  ), which we may call a line with
rational slope, we write Kfor the set of (ez1,ez2)inC∗2with (z1,z2)inL. This is an
algebraic curve (and even a translate of a group subvariety). Then we write G=L×K
(still a translate of a group subvariety) and
(1.7) T=S∩G.
We will see in Section  5  that if the variety Tis non-empty then it is infinite.
Our result for n= 2is as follows.
Theorem 1.2.SupposeSis an irreducible surface in C2×C∗2, and letZ=ZSbe the
set of points (  1.1  )inS.
(a)Ifdimπ(S) = 0thenπ(Z)is a single point, so Zariski dense in π(S).
(b)Ifdimπ(S) = 2thenπ(Z)is infinite, and even Zariski dense in π(S).
(c)Ifdimπ(S) = 1and the Zariski closure of π(S)is not a line of rational slope, then
π(Z)is infinite, so Zariski dense in π(S).
(d)Ifdimπ(S) = 1and the Zariski closure of π(S)is a line of rational slope L, then
the following subcases depending on Tin(  1.7  )are possible:
(d1)IfTis empty then π(Z)is empty.
(d2)IfdimT= 2thenπ(Z)is infinite, so Zariski dense in π(S).
(d3)IfdimT= 1then the following subcases are possible:
(d31)Ifdimπ(T) = 0thenπ(Z)is non-empty and finite, so not Zariski dense
inπ(S).
(d32)Ifdimπ(T) = 1thenπ(Z)is infinite, so Zariski dense in π(S).4 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
In particular the only situation where there are no points (  1.1  )inSis  (d1)  of  (d)  ; a
typical example is (  1.2  ), where nowLis defined by X1+X2=eandKbyˆX1ˆX2=e. We
stress that all possible cases and subcases may happen.
A proof sketch. The key ideas of our proofs build on those of [  17  ] forn= 1. We proceed
to recall the arguments there for the example X1=ˆX1.
To solve the resulting ez=zwe look at the function Φ(z) =ez−z, an entire function
of order at most 1. Using Hadamard’s Factorization Theorem as in [  17  ] or better [  15  , XIII
3.5] we find that if Φhas no zeroes then it is eϕforϕentire. A standard application of
Borel-Carathéodory (see below) shows that ϕis a polynomial of degree at most 1. So
there would be a,binCwith
(1.8) ez−z=eaz+b.
This can be disproved in an elementary way by repeated differentiation, or less elementary
using algebraic structure theorems of van den Dries [  22  ] and of Henson and Rubel [  13  ]; in
our situation for general nit suffices to apply a well-known result of Ax [  1  ] (which in fact
is a functional analogue of Schanuel’s Conjecture).
Let us examine more closely why our results are new for n= 2. Consider the example
X1X2= 1,ˆX1+ˆX2= 1.
Solving for (  1.1  )is equivalent to solving the single (non-polynomial-exponential) equation
(1.9) ez+e1/z= 1
in complex numbers z̸= 0, which does not seem trivial but one sees no obvious obstruction.
The basic argument in [  5  ], finding a fairly obvious approximate solution (like z0= 200πi
toez=z), then refining it and then using Newton’s Method to home in on an actual
solution, seems numerically to give convergence (see also Section  7  ). However for
(1.10) ez+ez2= 1
andz0= (200πi)1/2=√
100π(1 +i)the matter is less clear, and numerically there are
hints of the “chaos” which is well-known to exist in Newton’s Method, with convincing
convergenceonlyafter20iterations. Curiouslyenough, itworksfinefor z0=−√
100π(1+i).
In fact the method used in [  17  ] works very well for (  1.10  ): we find instead of (  1.8  )
ez+ez2−1 =eaz2+bz+c
which can be disproved as before. Our main contribution in this paper is to show that it
extends to (  1.9  ) and our general situation.
As it stands, this argument fails for (  1.9  ), because we have an essential singularity at
z= 0. Thus we have to restrict to C\{0}. But generally Φanalytic on C\{0}with no
zeroes on C\{0}need not be eϕforϕanalytic on C\{0}. A simple counterexample is
Φ(z) =z.POLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES OF SOLVABILITY 5
Littlewood [  10  , p. 392] said “it can pay to find out what is the worst enemy of what you
want to prove, and then induce him to change sides”. This we do here; the argument to
prove Φ =eϕconstructsϕas/integraldisplayΦ′(z)
Φ(z)dz,
and all we have to do is stay inside C\{0}and ensure that the integral along the homology
loops containing z= 0vanishes, which can be arranged by multiplying Φby a power of
the “enemy” z. The upshot for (  1.9  ) is that
(1.11) ez+e1/z−1 =zmeϕ(z)
for some integer mand someϕanalytic on C\{0}.
But now we will have to be more careful with Borel-Carathéodory and z= 0, and in
fact it yields only
(1.12) ϕ(z) =az2+bz+c+d
z+e
z2
now with an exponent of zbigger than one might expect and of course of 1/ztoo.
Nevertheless still Ax-Lindemann leads to a contradiction.
For examples like
ez+e1/(z3+z+1)= 1
we have to avoid three points, so three enemies, namely the three factors of z3+z+ 1,
and leading to homology of rank 3.
More generally, we have
Example 1.3.Suppose Φis analytic on C\{p1,...,ps−1}and never vanishes there.
Then there are integers m1,...,ms−1such that
Φ(z) = (z−p1)m1···(z−ps−1)ms−1eϕ(z)
for someϕalso analytic on C\{p1,...,ps−1}.
Consider next the surface
X3
1+X1+ 1 =X2
2,ˆX1+ˆX2= 1
leading to
ez+e√
z3+z+1= 1.
As the projection to C2is the affine part of an elliptic curve E, we can no longer work
withC\Sfor a finite set S, and this particular problem concerns E\{O}for the origin
O. In fact the homology is the same as that of E, with rank 2, and so we have to find
two enemies. These can be written down explicitly on the universal cover CofEin terms
of Weierstrass ℘andζfunctions, or by integrating suitable differentials of the first and
second kind onE\{O}. They are in fact the very simplest examples of Baker-Akhiezer
functions (see [  3  , Ch. XIV] and the foreword by Krichever), although they were known6 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
to Weierstrass. For these there seem to be no algebraic structure theorems, but again
Ax-Lindemann suffices for a contradiction.
To see this in action, represent E\{O}in the form y2= 4x3−g2x−g3(a simple change
of variables suffices). Recall that Ecan be seen as the quotient of Cby a two-dimensional
lattice Ω, so we may think of functions on E\{O}as doubly periodic functions on C\Ω.
The associated Weierstrass ζhas the property that for every ω∈Ω, there is a quasiperiod
ηsuch thatζ(z+ω) =ζ(z) +η. Explicit enemies are then the functions eωζ(z)−ηzfor any
non-zeroω. The outcome is the following analogue of (  1.11  ).
Example 1.4.Suppose Φis doubly periodic with respect to Ω, analytic on C\Ωand
never vanishes there. Then there is a period ω, with quasi-period η, such that
Φ(z) =eωζ(z)−ηzeϕ(z)
for someϕalso doubly periodic with respect to Ωand analytic on C\Ω.
Going further, to solve
ez+e1/√
z3+z+1= 1
we have to avoid an additional three points (the zeroes of z3+z+ 1), leading to homology
of rank 5 and differentials of the third kind or the Weierstrass sigma function (also Baker-
Akhiezer). Here too we get an analogue of (  1.11  ). See(  6.5  ),(  6.13  ),(  6.16  )in Section  6  for
more examples.
Finally consider
(1.13) X9
1+X9
2= 1,ˆX1+ˆX2= 1
leading to a curve Cof genus 28 and homology rank 56. To write down the enemies as
complex functions (on the covering space) is not so easy without the aid of theta functions
(in 28 variables), but on the curve the 56 enemies correspond again to a suitable choice of
differentials of the first and second kind (and generally we need the third kind too).
After working out our proofs in terms of these explicitly constructed enemies we realized
that there is a more abstract proof based on the canonical isomorphism between algebraic
and analytic de Rham cohomology of complex affine varieties, dating back to Grothendieck
[  12  ]. That paper actually uses Hironaka’s resolution of singularities, but we found that
this was not needed in our situation (see Section  3  for more details). So in the end we were
able to avoid any appeal to [  12  ] by using instead suitable differentials on the underlying
curve. This is the proof that we present here; nevertheless we do give an account of the
original more explicit constructions, also because these seem to be helpful in obtaining
effective versions of our results in which, for example, the zeroes can be localized.
Further remarks. In [  5  ], with the points (  1.1  )onVprojecting to a Zariski dense subset
ofCn, we noted that this holds even in a strong sense of being “relatively near” to anyPOLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES OF SOLVABILITY 7
one of “sufficiently many” points on (2πiZ)n. It would be interesting to obtain similar
strengthenings in our present set-up.
It is also natural to consider the distribution of the unprojected points (  1.1  ). In the
situation of [  5  ] the trick extends at once to show that they are Zariski dense in Vitself. For
ifGinC[X1,...,Xn,ˆX1,..., ˆXn]does not vanish on V, we may apply [  5  ] to the variety
inCn+1×C∗n+1defined by the equations of Vtogether with G=ˆXn+1.
In our situation the analogous statement is unclear, even for n= 2. This is illustrated
by case  (c)  in Theorem  1.2  . Just for the example (  1.13  )the density inSwould amount
to the fact that there is no G̸= 0inC[X1,ˆX1]such thatG(z,ez) = 0for allzwith
ez+e9√
1−z9= 1, which does not seem obvious.
In fact this case  (c)  is the only problem, as will be established during the proof.
It would also be interesting to extend the investigations to π(V)of other dimensions.
The simplest case of dimension 2 in C3×C∗3leads to systems of equations such as
ez+ez2−w2=z, ew+ez2−w2=−w.
But it may be more difficult to find corresponding extensions of Theorem  1.2  . This is
because of the obstructions coming from the concept of “normal” (see [  27  , p. 75]). For
Cn×C∗nit amounts to the following. For k= 1,...,nand a matrix of kindependent
rows andncolumns with integer entries mijwe define a map µfromCn×C∗ntoCk×C∗k
by
µ(X1,...,Xn,ˆX1,..., ˆXn) =
n/summationdisplay
j=1m1jXj,...,n/summationdisplay
j=1mkjXj,n/productdisplay
j=1ˆXm1j
j,...,n/productdisplay
j=1ˆXmkj
j
.
Then one imposes the condition that dimµ(V)≥kfor allkandµ.
If this condition fails then some µ(V)may be too small to contain the analogues of
points (  1.1  ).
Note that normality is not a necessary condition; when n= 2it fails for the example
X1+X2= 1, ˆX1ˆX2=e
withk= 1andm11=m12= 1whereas here Zis clearly infinite. We note that this
surface is not “free” (see [  27  , pp. 74–75]); in fact, it turns out that for n= 2, “freeness”
and “normality” are equivalent.
We briefly mention some aspects of decidability and effectivity in our Theorem  1.1  .
Already in Theorem  1.2  forn= 2it may not be possible to decide for a given Swhich
of the various possibilities actually arises. Say the defining equations are just X1= 1,
ˆX1=θfor someθinC, so we are in  (d)  ; we find that we are in  (d1)  or  (d2)  according to
whethere̸=θore=θ. Now ifθis an explicitly given element of Q(π), this may not be
so easy, as for example with
6√
π5+π4= 2.7182818086 ...;8 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
and in general it involves Schanuel’s Conjecture of course (see [  14  , p. 31]).
Furthermore for three-folds in C3×C∗3another obstacle arises. Take any absolutely irre-
ducible polynomial Pin two variables over Q, andVdefined byP(X1/(2πi),X2/(2πi)) = 0
together with ˆX1= 1,ˆX2= 1. Then the points (  1.1  )correspond exactly to the integral
solutions of P(x1,x2) = 0. If the genus here is at least 2 then we know no algorithm for
finding these, as for example with
x4
1−2x4
2+x1x2+x1−n= 0,
and in general it involves Hilbert’s Tenth Problem (see for example [  9  ]).
We note also that just to decide if a variety is normal involves Zilber-Pink matters
(specifically the conjectures of intersection with tori or cosets as considered in [  26  ,  27  ] for
example).
Nevertheless we shall give some simple effectivity arguments for special cases of The-
orem  1.1  such as (  1.9  ).
Structure of the paper. The rest of our paper is arranged as follows.
In Section  2  we record some preliminary observations towards the proof of Theorem  1.1  ,
including the “punctured” version of Borel-Carathéodory which avoids z= 0and also the
version of Ax’s Theorem that we need.
Then in Section  3  we construct suitable differentials on the underlying curve π(V)and
deduce our special form of the Grothendieck result.
The proof of Theorem  1.1  follows in Section  4  , and that of Theorem  1.2  in Section  5  .
Then in Section  6  we present the explicit versions of (  1.11  )for small genus, and finally
in Section  7  we briefly explain about effectivity and Theorem  1.1  .
We are grateful to David Grant for his help in connexion with the genus 2 constructions
in Section  6  .
2.Preliminaries
From now on,Vwill be as in Theorem  1.1  . When dimV=nit will be important to
know thatVis defined, apart from the equations defining the curve π(V), by a single
additional equation.
Lemma 2.1.SupposeVis an irreducible algebraic variety in Cn×C∗nof dimension
nsuch that the Zariski closure of π(V)inCnis a curveC0. Let P0be the prime
ideal ofC0inR0=C[X1,...,Xn]. Similarly, write Pfor the prime ideal of Vin
R=C[X1,...,Xn,ˆX1,..., ˆXn].
Then there are FinP, not inMR0+P0Rfor any monomial MinˆX1,..., ˆXn, and
G0inR0, not in P0, such that Pis contained in G−1
0(FR+P0R). Furthermore ifC0is
a line then we can take G0= 1; in particular, if n= 2andC0is defined by the vanishing
of a polynomial F0of degree 1, then P=FR+F0R.POLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES OF SOLVABILITY 9
Proof.Letx1,...,xndenote the coordinate functions on C0, and call r0its coordinate ring
C[x1,...,xn]. By considering elements of Ras polynomials in ˆX1,..., ˆXnwe see that
the specialization σfrom Rtor0[ˆX1,..., ˆXn]has kernel P0R(which lies in P). We now
pass intoK0[ˆX1,..., ˆXn]with the quotient field K0=C(x1,...,xn)ofr0. We claim that
σ(P)is prime in r0[ˆX1,..., ˆXn], and then by clearing denominators we see that K0σ(P)
is prime in K0[ˆX1,..., ˆXn]too.
Indeed, suppose P1,P2are in r0[ˆX1,..., ˆXn]withP1P2inσ(P). ClearlyP1=σ(Q1),
P2=σ(Q2)withQ1,Q2inR, andP1P2=σ(Q)forQinP. ThusQ1Q2−Qis in the
kernel P0Rso in P. So alsoQ1Q2is in P. IfQ1is in PthenP1is inσ(P)and similarly
forP2; this gives the above claim.
Now R/Phas transcendence degree noverC, and it has a subfield R0/P0of transcend-
ence degree 1overC; thus R/Phas transcendence degree n−1over R0/P0. It follows
(see for example [  25  , p. 91]) that K0σ(P)is minimal in the sense of [  24  , p. 238]. This latter
reference (“Principal Ideal Theorem”) shows that K0σ(P)is principal, as K0[ˆX1,..., ˆXn]
is a unique factorization domain. We can further assume the generator is in σ(P), so it is
σ(F)for someFinP. IfFwere inMR0+P0Rfor some monomial Mas above then
σ(F) =σ(M)ffor some non-zero finr0, so we could have taken the generator as M;
however that would imply that the projection of VtoC∗nis empty, which is certainly not
the case.
Finally for each AinPthere ishAinK0[ˆX1,..., ˆXn]withσ(A) =hAσ(F)and there
isgA̸= 0inr0withgAhAinr0[ˆX1,..., ˆXn]. In particular gA=σ(GA)for someGAin
R0, andgAhA=σ(BA)for someBAinR. HenceAis inG−1
A(FR+P0R)and the result
follows on taking a finite basis for P.
IfC0is a line then r0is isomorphic to some C[x], thus a unique factorization domain.
Then C[x][ˆX1,..., ˆXn]is a unique factorization domain, so σ(P)is principal and we may
assumeσ(F)to be its generator, in which case we find P=FR+P0R, or in other words,
we may always take gA= 1. In the special case n= 2with P0generated by a polynomial
F0of degree 1, we find P=FR+F0R.
This completes the proof. □
Thus to find a point (  1.1  )onVit suffices to solve F(z1,...,zn,ez1,...,ezn) = 0with
(z1,...,zn)onC0butG0(z1,...,zn)̸= 0.
Next we recall a standard version of Borel-Carathéodory which estimates the absolute
value|ϕ0|in terms of the real part ℜϕ0.
Lemma 2.2.For0≤r<Rand anyϕ0analytic on the disc |w|≤Rwe have
sup
|w|≤r|ϕ0(w)| ≤2r

|w|≤Rℜϕ0(w) +R+r
R−r|ϕ0(0)|.
Proof.See for example [  15  , XII 3.1]. □10 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
This is used in the classical theory to deduce from an inequality ℜϕ0(w)≤c|w|κ(κ>0),
forϕ0entire and all|w|large, a similar inequality |ϕ0(w)|≤c′|w|κ. We use it here to
obtain the following consequence for functions ϕanalytic only near (but not at) a finite
point, which we can take as z= 0.
Lemma 2.3.Letϕbe a function analytic on a punctured neighbourhood of 0on which
ℜϕ(z)≤c
|z|κ
for some real c,κ≥0independent of z. Then there is a punctured neighbourhood of 0on
which
|ϕ(z)|≤c′
|z|κ+1
for some real c′independent of z.
Proof.Let0<|z|≤2δbe a punctured neighbourhood as in the assumption. The
conclusion will be about the neighbourhood 0<|z|≤δ. Writec1=sup|z|=δ|ϕ(z)|, and
choose any z1with 0<|z1|≤δ. We are going to apply Lemma  2.2  to carefully chosen
w-discs with
w=z−δz1
|z1|,
so that their centre w= 0lies on|z|=δ. Accordingly define
ϕ0(w) =ϕ/parenleftigg
w+δz1

r=δ−|z1|, R =δ−|z1|

so that 0≤r<R. Now|w|≤Rimplies

Then for

Lemma 2.4.In characteristic zero let Kbe a differential field with derivation Dand
constant field C. Letξ1,...,ξnbe inKand let ˆξ1,..., ˆξnbe inK∗such that:
(1)Dξi=Dˆξi/ˆξi(i= 1,...,n );
(2)m1ξ1+···+mnξnis not inCfor anym1,...,mninZnot all zero.
Then at least n+ 1amongξ1,...,ξn,ˆξ1,..., ˆξnare algebraically independent over C.
Proof.This follows at once from Theorem 3 of [  1  , p. 253] (with a single derivation); note
that the rank there is 1 because for example Dξn= 0would imply ξninCcontradicting
 (2)  . Note also that  (2)  implies that ξ1,...,ξnare all not in C, and in particular are all
non-zero, which seems to be an additional assumption of this Theorem 3 (and is superfluous
anyway). □
In fact we will not need the full force of [  1  ], because we apply it with ξ1,...,ξnin the
function field K0of a curve with D= d/dzfor some (non-constant) zinK0. Then in
fact ˆξ1=eξ1,..., ˆξn=eξnare algebraically independent over K0(so we are rather with
what is known in the trade as “Ax-Lindemann-Weierstrass”). This could be seen directly
by considering a relation/summationtextM

finally comparing poles of DβM/βMandDαM.
It is convenient to record the following obvious consequence for n= 1(“Ax-Hermite-

are algebraically independent over C.
3.Duality and periods
Here we record a number of results on functions and differentials, first of all rational and
then only meromorphic, on an algebraic curve. Thus let Cbe a complete smooth complex
algebraic curve of genus g≥0, and letSbe a finite subset of Cwith cardinality s≥1.
Denote byCSthe (affine) curve C\S. By (meromorphic) differential onCSwe mean a
differential 1-form, that is, ΨdΦforΦ,Ψmeromorphic onCS; we call such a differential
regularonCSif it has no poles, and rational if we can take Ψ,Φrational.
Let∆Sdenote the space of all rational differentials that are regular on CS, modulo the
ones of the form dϕforϕrational and with no poles on CS(we call those exact). In other
words, ∆Sis the first cohomology group of the algebraic de Rham complex of CS.
Lemma 3.1.The linear space ∆Shas dimension 2g+s−1. Furthermore, given some
fixedP0inS, each element of ∆Scan be represented by a differential with at most simple
poles inS\{P0}.12 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
Proof.This is fairly well-known, but we show how to recover it easily from the Riemann-
Roch theorem. For a given Z-divisorD, letL(D)be the space of all rational functions
onCwith divisor at least −D, andℓ(D)be its dimension. Let Kzbe the divisor of some
rational differential form on C, say dzfor some non-constant rational function z. Then
Riemann-Roch states that
(3.1) ℓ(D) =ℓ(Kz−D) + deg(D) + 1−g.
Furthermore, recall that ℓ(Kz−D)is also the dimension of the rational differential forms
with divisor at least D. See for example [  21  , p. 17].
Fix someP0inS. For positive msufficiently large, consider the space of differentials
with pole at P0of order at most m, and at most simple poles on the rest of S(and no
other poles). This has dimension ℓ(Kz−D)for
D=−/summationdisplay
P∈SP−(m−1)P0
and since here ℓ(D) = 0we get dimension m+s+g−2. And the subspace of the exact
ones (which of course have no simple poles) has dimension ℓ((m−1)P0)−1 =m−g−1.
Thus the quotient, which embeds naturally into ∆S, has dimension 2g+s−1.
We now claim that all other differentials are equivalent to the ones above. Let δbe a
regular differential on CS. Suppose that δhas pole of order k>1at somePinS\{P0}.
By(  3.1  ), for every mlarge enough, there must be a function hinL((k−1)P+mP 0)
which is not inL((k−2)P+mP 0), thus with pole of order exactly k−1atPand no
other poles except possibly at P0. It follows that δ+αdh, for someαinC, has pole of
order≤k−1atP, and the same poles as δon the rest of S\{P0}. By an easy induction
on the orders of the poles of δoutside ofP0, one finds fsuch thatδ+ dfhas poles of
order at most one on S\{P0}, as required. □
ForCandSas above, it is well-known that the homology H1(CS)ofCS=C\Sis free
of rank 2g+s−1(see for example [  21  , p. 101]).
Lemma 3.2.The pairing H1(CS)×∆S→Cinduced by integration is non-degenerate.
Proof.SinceH1(C)and∆Shave both dimension 2g+s−1, it suffices to observe the
following: if a regular differential δonCSis such that/contintegraltext
Γδ= 0over every closed path Γon
CS, thenδis exact, that is, δ= dϕfor some rational function ϕ.
Letδbe one such form. Then for instance/integraltextQ
Q0δ, withQ0inCSfixed, defines a regular
functionϕonCS, and we have δ= dϕ. Writeδ=fdz, wheref,zare rational and zis a
local parameter at some QinS. Clearly, if fhas a pole of order k≥1atQ, then for any
κ>k−1there iscsuch that|ϕ(P)|≤c|z(P)|−κfor allPin a neighbourhood of Q. It
follows that ϕextends to a meromorphic function on C=CS∪S, thusϕis rational by the
Riemann Existence Theorem or Chow’s Theorem. □POLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES OF SOLVABILITY 13
Lemma 3.3.LetΦ,Ψbe functions analytic on CS. Then there is a rational differential
δregular onCSand a function ϕanalytic onCSsuch that
(3.2) ΨdΦ =δ+ dϕ.
Proof.Consider the periods given by the integrals/contintegraltext
ΓΨdΦ. By Lemma  3.2  there is a
regular differential δonCSwith exactly the same periods. In particular,/contintegraltext
ΓΨdΦ =/contintegraltext
Γδfor
every ΓinH1(CS). It follows that
ϕ(Q) =/integraldisplayQ
Q0(ΨdΦ−δ)
for some fixed Q0inCSdefines an analytic function on CS, hence ΨdΦ−δ= dϕ, as
desired. □
One can also deduce Lemma  3.3  from Grothendieck’s paper [  12  ] (which is actually an
extract from a letter to Atiyah). It relates the complex cohomology (denoted by H∗(X,C)
there) to the de Rham cohomology (denoted by H∗(X,ΩX)there), even for an algebraic
varietyXof any dimension. The proof uses Hironaka’s resolution of singularities, which
for curvesXis classical.
Further one can describe the pairing in Lemma  3.2  more explicitly by looking at period
matrices. Enumerate S={P0,P1,...,Ps−1}. We can make a Z-basis
(3.3) L1,...,L2g,M1,...,Ms−1
forH1(CS)out of basis elements L1,...,L2gofH1(C)and small loopsM1,...,Ms−1
around the points P1,...,Ps−1respectively of S\{P0}.
By Lemma  3.1  applied toS0={P0},S1={P0,P1},...and linear algebra we can make
aC-basis
(3.4) ρ1,...,ρ 2g,σ1,...,σs−1
for∆Sout of differentials of the second kind ρ1,...,ρ 2g(with pole at most in P0and residue
zero) together with σ1,...,σs−1(with simple poles exactly at P1,...,Ps−1respectively
and only other pole at P0). Indexing the rows by the differentials and the columns by the
loops, we get a period matrix. The block Πof size 2gin the top left corner corresponds to
the period matrix for the case S={P0}, hence it is non-singular, and to its right there is
a zero block. The block underneath Πwe do not know, but to its right we get the diagonal
matrix whose diagonal entries are the (non-zero) residues of σ1,...,σs−1atP1,...,Ps−1.
We discuss in Section  6  some examples in which such differentials can be made explicit via
well known special functions.
4.Proof of Theorem  1.1  
It suffices to prove the result when Vhas dimension n. In fact the hypotheses imply the
dimension is norn+ 1, and in the latter case we can simply adjoin ˆXn=c.14 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
LetC0be the Zariski closure of π(V)inCn, and letF,G 0be as in Lemma  2.1  . Let
Cbe a complete smooth model of C0, so that the coordinate functions x1,...,xnonC0
can be regarded as rational functions ξ1,...,ξnonC. Choose a non-empty finite subset
SofCcontaining all the poles of ξ1,...,ξnand the zeroes of G0(ξ1,...,ξn)(which is not
identically zero). It will then suffice to find a point of CS=C\Sat which the function
(4.1) Φ =F(ξ1,...,ξn,eξ1,...,eξn)
vanishes.
Notethatwecantake Sarbitrarilylarge,andthiswillshowthatthepoints (z1,...,zn,ez1,...,ezn)
ofVproject to a set which is Zariski dense in C0, as mentioned in Section  1  .
We assume that there are no such points, and we will reach a contradiction. Thus Φ
does not vanish on CS. By Lemma  3.3  applied to Ψ = 1/Φwe have(  3.2  )for some rational
differential δonC, regular onCS, and a function ϕ, analytic onCS.
Claim4.1.Under the above assumptions, ϕis rational onC.
Proof.We note that all periods of dΦ/Φare in 2πiZ, because any integral is the variation
oflogΦcontinuously along the contour (“Principle of the Argument”). As these are also
the periods of δ=dΦ/Φ−dϕ, we can define exp(/integraltextδ)as a function onCS, for example as
(4.2) Φ0(Q) = exp/parenleftigg/integraldisplayQ
Q0δ/parenrightigg
= exp/parenleftigg/integraldisplayQ
Q0/parenleftiggdΦ
Φ−dϕ/parenrightigg/parenrightigg
for any fixed Q0inCS. Thus dΦ0/Φ0=δ. Comparing this with (  3.2  ) we deduce that
(4.3) Φ(Q) =c0Φ0(Q)eϕ(Q), (c0= Φ(Q0)e−ϕ(Q0)̸= 0)
and from this we will estimate ϕ(Q)asQapproaches some point PofS.
Letzbe a local parameter at this P, so that we can regard everything in (  4.3  )as
functions of z. Suppose ξ1,...,ξnhave poles of orders at most k≥0atP. Then
|Φ(Q)|≤cexp(c|z(Q)|−k)by(  4.1  )for somecindependent of Q. Next if we write δ=ψdz
thenψhas a pole of order at most k0≥0atP. In(  4.2  )it is not difficult to see that we
can choose the contour to have length bounded independently of Q(nearP) and with
|ψ|≤c|z|−k0, and it follows that |/integraltextQ
Q0δ|≤c|z|−k0for somecindependent of Q(where
for shortz=z(Q)). Thus|Φ0(Q)|−1=exp(−ℜ/integraltextQ
Q0δ)≤exp(c|z|−k0). So we get similar
bounds for|eϕ(Q)|=|c−1
0Φ(Q)Φ0(Q)−1|, and it follows that
ℜϕ(Q) = log|eϕ(Q)|≤c|z|−κ
forκ= max{k,k 0}and somecindependent of Q. By Lemma  2.3  we deduce
|ϕ(Q)|≤c|z|−κ−1.
Thusϕis meromorphic at P, and so (as in the proof of Lemma  3.2  , say by Riemann
Existence) is rational on Cas claimed. □POLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES OF SOLVABILITY 15
We can now obtain our contradiction using Ax (Lemma  2.4  ) on(  4.3  ). We can identify
the function field K0=C(x1,...,xn)of the affine part of CwithC(ξ1,...,ξn), and we
takeK=K0(ˆξ1,..., ˆξn)with ˆξ1=eξ1,..., ˆξn=eξn.
For a non-constant rational function zonCwe have a derivation D= d/dzonKwith
constant field C=C, also acting on K0. Note that  (1)  of Lemma  2.4  holds. With δ=ψdz
as above we have DΦ0/Φ0=ψfrom (  4.2  ) and so
(4.4) DΦ =χΦ
forχ=ψ+DϕinK0. Writing F=/summationtext
iFiMifori= (i1,...,in), whereFiis in

AlsoDΦi/Φi=ξifor

We find from (  4.4  ) the equations/summationtext
iβiΦi= 0for
βi=Dγi+ξiγi−χγi
also inK0.
If someβi̸= 0this shows that the transcendence degree of K0(ˆξ1,..., ˆξn)overK0is
at mostn−1, so over Cat mostn, contradicting Lemma  2.4  (note that  (2)  there holds
because we are assuming that m1X1+···+mnXnis not constant on V). Thus we may
assume that all βi= 0.
Next suppose there are two different i,i′with
γ=γi̸= 0̸=γi′=γ′.
Then
0 =βi
γ−βi′
γ′=Dγ

and it follows that Dξ=Dˆξ/ˆξfor
ˆξ=γ′
γ, ξ =m1ξ1+···+mnξn
with (m1,...,mn) =i−i′̸= 0. Hereξ,ˆξare both in K0, so algebraically dependent over
C. Thus by Corollary  2.5  ξlies in C. However this is also ruled out by our assumption on
m1X1+···+mnXn.
Thus there is at most one non-zero γi, and theFi′(i′̸=i)are in the prime ideal P0
ofCinR0. But then F=FiMi+/summationtext
i′̸=iFi′Mi′would be in MiR0+P0R, excluded in
Lemma  2.1  .
This completes the proof of Theorem  1.1  .16 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
5.Proof of Theorem  1.2  
We go through it case-by-case-by-subcase-by-subsubcase.
Case  (a)  .Here dimπ(S) = 0, and the conclusion is clear. An example is X1= 0,X2= 0
withZas the single point (0,0,1,1).
Case  (b)  .Here dimπ(S) = 2, this follows from [  5  ], even with Zdense inS. An elementary
example is ˆX1= 1,ˆX2= 1withZ= (2πiZ)2×{1}2.
Case  (c)  .Fordimπ(S) = 1andπ(S)not contained in a line of rational slope, the
conclusion is essentially our Theorem  1.1  forn= 2; we just have to recall the remark at
the beginning of Section  4  that the finite set Scan be taken arbitrarily large. We have
already given some examples but an elementary one is X1X2= 1,ˆX1ˆX2= 1withZas
the set of all (z,1/z,ez,e1/z)withz+ 1/zin2πiZ.
We now consider π(S)of dimension 1and contained in a line of rational slope L. Say
thatLis defined by m1X1+m2X2=cwithm1,m2integers not both zero and ccomplex,
as in (  1.3  ). ThenKis given by
(5.1) ˆXm1
1ˆXm2
2= ˆc
with ˆc=ec. Recall thatTfrom (  1.7  ) isT=S∩G =S∩(L×K ).
Subcase  (d1)  of case  (d)  .Here the setTis empty, and the set Zof(z1,z2,ez1,ez2)in
Slies inGand so inT, henceZis empty. We already gave the example (  1.2  ).
Subcase  (d2)  .Here dimT= 2, and we can even show that Zis dense inS. Note that
in this caseS=G=T(becauseSandGare irreducible surfaces), and thus Zcoincides
with the set of (z1,z2,ez1,ez2)with (z1,z2)inL. It is now not difficult to see, using the
algebraic independence of zandez, thatZis Zariski dense in S; for example if m2̸= 0it
contains the set of (z,z′,ez,ez′)aszvaries in C, wherez′= (c−m1z)/m2(see also the
parametrizations (  5.2  ),(  5.3  )below). An example is X1+X2= 1,ˆX1ˆX2=ewithZas
the set of (z,1−z,ez,e1−z)forzinC.
Finally, we settle the remaining cases with dimT= 1.
Subsubcase  (d31)  of subcase  (d3)  .Here dimπ(T) = 0. Since the set π(Z)is contained
inπ(T), it must be finite or empty. Thus Zis finite or empty as well.
In factZcannot be empty. Namely, for each Qinπ(T)the fibreπ−1(Q)inThas
dimπ−1(Q)≤1, and there must be Qwith equality. As Tis inG=L×K, the fibre must
be the whole of Q×K. WritingQ= (z1,z2)we see that in particular (z1,z2,ez1,ez2)is in
the fibre, so inTand thereforeS.
An example is X1+X2= 1, X 1+ˆX1ˆX2=ewithZas the single point (0,1,1,e).
However changing the second equation here to X1−X2
1+ˆX1ˆX2=egives an extra point
(1,0,e,1)and soZneed not be a single point as in case  (a)  .POLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES OF SOLVABILITY 17
Subsubcase  (d32)  .This final possibility, dimπ(T) = 1, involves the operation of “back-
substitution” to land in C×C∗, so we give the full details. For the moment we assume
only the hypotheses in  (d)  , that is,π(S)has dimension 1and is contained in a line Lof
rational slope.
We can suppose that m1,m2are coprime. Fix integers a1,a2witha1m1+a2m2= 1.
We can parametrize Lby
(5.2) X1=a1c+m2Y, X 2=a2c−m1Y
and correspondingly Kby
(5.3) ˆX1= ˆca1ˆYm2,ˆX2= ˆca2ˆY−m1.
By Lemma  2.1  ourSis defined by m1X1+m2X2=candF= 0. ThusTis defined by
m1X1+m2X2=c,(  5.1  )andF= 0. We now check, as mentioned in the introduction,
that ifTis non-empty then it is infinite.
For this we define a morphism ffromStoGmbyf(X1,X2,ˆX1,ˆX2) = ˆXm1
1ˆXm2
2. If
fwere not dominant, then ˆXm1
1ˆXm2
2would be a constant ˆc′onS. ThenSwould be
contained inL×K′for some translate K′ofK. Asm1,m2are coprime,K′is irreducible;
soS=L×K′. Now in factK′=K, elseSandG=L×Kwould not intersect and T
would be empty. Thus S=L×K =GandT=Sis certainly infinite (and we end up in
subcase  (d2)  ).
Thus we can suppose that fis dominant. Now the Fibre Dimension Theorem [  6  , p. 228]
says thatf−1(ˆc) =Thas dimension at least 1; and this finishes the checking.
Define ˜DinC×C∗as the set of (Y,ˆY)withG= 0, where
G=G(Y,ˆY) =F(a1c+m2Y,a 2c−m1Y,ˆca1ˆYm2,ˆca2ˆY−m1).
Then (  5.2  ), (  5.3  ) define a map φfrom ˜DtoT. Its inverse is given by for example
Y=a2X1−a1X2, ˆY=ˆXa2
1ˆX−a1
2
and so we have isomorphisms.
Therefore returning to our subsubcase  (d32)  we must have dim ˜D= 1. In particular G
is not identically constant.
However it may not be irreducible; but any irreducible factor gives an irreducible curve.
There is at least one of these curves, say D, on whichYis not constant, else Ywould take
at most finitely many values on ˜Dand then (X1,X2)would take at most finitely many
values inϕ(˜D) =Tby(  5.1  ), contrary to our assumption dimπ(T) = 1. Therefore by
Theorem  1.1  the setWof points (w,ew)onDproject to a Zariski dense subset of C. It
follows that π(φ(W))is Zariski dense in π(S). Finallyφ(W)is contained in Zby(  5.2  )
and (  5.3  ).
An example is (  1.5  ); the choice a1= 0,a2= 1leads toY=X1,ˆY=ˆX1and so (  1.6  ).18 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
6.Examples
We can actually go further with (  4.3  )in the style ez+e1/z−1 =zmeϕ(z)of(  1.11  ).
Namely the period matrix just after (  3.4  )is some invertible M. Thus we can act on
(  3.4  )by2πiM−1to get 2πiIhfor the identity matrix of order h= 2g+s−1, and then
integrating these and exponentiating as in (  4.2  )gives Φ1,..., Φhanalytic onCSand never
vanishing there. Now the period (row) vector of dΦ/Φis2πimfor some m= (m1,...,mh)
inZh, and so we find
(6.1) Φ = Φm1
1···Φmh
heϕ
in (  4.3  ).
Originally we proved (  6.1  )for small genus actually by constructing Φ1,..., Φhdirectly
in anad hocfashion. As some amusing formulae turned up we feel it may be of some
interest to present our constructions here.
Caseg= 0.NowCmay be taken as P1, which we identify with C∪{∞}.
Ifs= 1thenh= 0and there is nothing to do. So we assume s≥2.
IfScontains∞thenS={∞,p1,...,ps−1}, and clearly z−p1,...,z−ps−1are the
desired Φi’s. And indeed we find d(z−pi)/(z−pi) = dz/(z−pi) =σisatisfying exactly
the same conditions as in the original (  3.4  ). The period matrix in Lemma  3.2  , with the
homology basis (  3.3  ), is2πiIs−1(provided we choose the appropriate orientations). Thus
δin Lemma  3.3  for general Φmust have a decomposition
δ=m1σ1+···+ms−1σs−1
now with integer coefficients. And so Φ0(z) = (z−p1)m1···(z−ps−1)ms−1in the proof of
Claim  4.1  . Thus if Φis any function analytic on CSand not vanishing there, it has the
form
Φ(z) = (z−p1)m1···(z−ps−1)ms−1eϕ(z)
for someϕalso analytic on CS, exactly as in Example  1.3  . The special case s= 2and
p1= 0is (  1.11  ).
IfS={p0,p1,...,ps−1}does not contain ∞, then we can use in a similar way for
example
z−p1
z−p0,...,z−ps−1
z−p0.
Caseg= 1.NowCcan be taken as an elliptic curve E, with origin O, whose affine part is
y2= 4x3−g2x−g3.
It is parametrized by the Weierstrass functions x=℘(z),y=℘′(z)with corresponding
period lattice Ω.POLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES OF SOLVABILITY 19
Now examples of Φare not so easy to write analytically as z−p; but we found the
following, at first for S={O}. Take any period ωinΩ. It has a corresponding quasi-period
ηdefined byζ(z+ω) =ζ(z) +ηfor the associated Weierstrass zeta function. Then
(6.2) Φ(ω)(z) =eωζ(z)−ηz
is doubly periodic. This is because
ωζ(z+ ˜ω)−η(z+ ˜ω) =ωζ(z)−ηz+ω˜η−η˜ω
for any other period ˜ωwith quasi-period ˜η; and the Legendre relations show that ω˜η−η˜ω
is in 2πiZ. In fact we have here the very simplest form of a Baker-Akhiezer function,
with an essential singularity at z= 0; see [  3  ] Chapter XIV and in particular page xxviii
of Krichever’s foreword for more general versions, although this particular example does
occur, even for arbitrary genus, in Weierstrass [  23  , p. 312]. It clearly does not vanish on
ESforS={O}.
See also Pellarin [  20  ] for analogues of Baker-Akhiezer in positive characteristic.
In fact we get two for the price of one by taking basis elements of Ω =Zω1+Zω2and
corresponding η1,η2soΦ1,Φ2(note that these depend on the choice of basis, but the
multiplicative group they generate does not). As ζ′=−℘we find
dΦi
Φi=−(ωi℘(z) +ηi)dz=−(ωix+ηi)dx
y(i= 1,2).
There are loopsL1,L2with

by the more precise form of Legendre (depending on orientation). This does not quite
give2πiIh= 2πiI2for the case S={O}; but at least we get 2πiUfor unimodular Uwith
detU=±1. This is already enough to imply that any function Φ, analytic onESand
never vanishing there, has the form Φ = Φm1
1Φm2
2eϕforϕalso analytic onES; which is
equivalent to Example  1.4  .
For more general S={O,P 1,...,Ps−1}containingOwe found other examples as follows.
SupposeP̸=O; then we can write P= (℘(u),℘′(u))and define
(6.3) Ψ(u)(z) =σ(z−u)
σ(z)euζ(z)
for the Weierstrass sigma function (note that this depends on the choice of ubut if we
changeuby a period ωthen Ψ(u)changes by Φ(ω)up to constants). It is analytic on Ewith20 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
O,Premoved and never vanishes there. It too is a Baker-Akhiezer function (and almost
certainly known to Weierstrass) with its essential singularity at z= 0. That distinguishes
it from a similar expression occurring in the exponential map for a multiplicative extension
ofE, which has eζ(u)zin place ofeuζ(z).
Asσ′/σ=ζwe obtain
(6.4)dΨ(u)
Ψ(u)= (ζ(z−u)−ζ(z)−u℘(z))dz,
which by the addition theorem for ζis

Both have residue divisor P−O.
Thus with P=P1,...,Ps−1(of course giving rise to σ1,...,σs−1in(  3.4  )above) and
M1,...,Ms−1as in the proof of Lemma  3.2  we obtain in the bottom right block of the
period matrix a diagonal matrix with entries ±2πi. So again something unimodular and
corresponding Ψ1,..., Ψs−1.
Therefore any function Φ, analytic onESand never vanishing there, has the form
(6.5) Φ = Φm1
1Φm2
2Ψn1

forϕalso analytic onES.
Occasionally we can find simpler Ψ. For example if P= (e,0)is a point of order 2 then
Ψ =x−e=℘(z)−eis analytic onESforS={O,P}and never vanishes there (even
without essential singularity). And if say e=℘(ω/2)then indeed
℘(z)−e=(Ψ(ω/2)(z))2
(σ(ω/2))2Φ(ω)(z).
And if ourS={P0,P1,...,Ps−1}does not contain Othen we can simply use the group
law to reduce to{O,P 1−P0,...,Ps−1−P0}thus obtaining for example Φ(ω)(z−u0)in
place of (  6.2  ).
Caseg= 2.Here it will suffice to deal with a complex hyperelliptic curve Hwhose affine
part is defined by
(6.6) y2=x5+b1x4+b2x3+b3x2+b4x+b5
with the discriminant of the right-hand side non-zero. We are therefore using the notation
of Grant [  11  ]. Of course there is no longer a parametrization by C. To obtain the analogue
of℘and so on we must embed Hinto its Jacobian, which is parametrized by C2.POLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES OF SOLVABILITY 21
We originally constructed examples of Φusing theta functions. We fix a matrix
T=
τ1τ
τ τ 2
in the Siegel upper half space. We have a standard theta function θ(z)
defined for z=
z1
z2
by
θ(z) =/summationdisplay
p∈Z2exp(πi(ptTp+ 2ptz))
with column vectors p. It satisfies
θ(z+e1) =θ(z), θ(z+e2) =θ(z)
fore1=
1
0
,e2=
0
1
, as well as
θ(z+t1) =c1exp(−2πiz1)θ(z), θ(z+t2) =c2exp(−2πiz2)θ(z)
fort1=
τ1
τ
,t2=
τ
τ2
and constants c1,c2(see for example [  18  , pp. 118–120]).
So the “Baker zeta functions”
ζ1=1
θ∂θ
∂z1, ζ 2=1
θ∂θ
∂z2
satisfy
(6.7)
ζ1(z+e1) =ζ1(z), ζ1(z+e2) =ζ1(z), ζ1(z+t1) =−2πi+ζ1(z), ζ1(z+t2) =ζ1(z),
(6.8)
ζ2(z+e1) =ζ2(z), ζ2(z+e2) =ζ2(z), ζ2(z+t1) =ζ2(z), ζ2(z+t2) =−2πi+ζ2(z).
So miraculously
(6.9) Φ1=eζ1,Φ2=eζ2
are “quadruply periodic” (also known to Weierstrass). Suitably translated, these generalize
one of the Φ(ω)=eωζ(z)−ηz; in fact here ω= 1andη= 0in the new normalization.
We need another pair corresponding to ω=τ. A short calculation shows that
ζ3=τ1ζ1+τζ2+ 2πiz1, ζ 4=τζ1+τ2ζ2+ 2πiz2
satisfy
(6.10)
ζ3(z+e1) =ζ3(z) + 2πi, ζ 3(z+e2) =ζ3(z), ζ3(z+t1) =ζ3(z), ζ3(z+t2) =ζ3(z),
(6.11)
ζ4(z+e1) =ζ4(z), ζ4(z+e2) =ζ4(z) + 2πi, ζ 4(z+t1) =ζ4(z), ζ4(z+t2) =ζ4(z).22 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
Thus
(6.12) Φ3=eτ1ζ1+τζ2+2πiz1,Φ4=eτζ1+τ2ζ2+2πiz2
will do (known of course to Weierstrass).
These are functions on open subsets of C2, and we get functions on Hby taking
restrictions to a one-dimensional analytic set. So we have to understand their poles,
which just come from the zeroes of θ. In the usual notation we choose basis elements
A1,A2,B1,B2(akaL1,L2,L3,L4in(  3.3  )above) for the homology of Hin the standard
way and then differentials ρ1,ρ2of the first kind on Hnormalized such that the respective
integrals of
ρ1
ρ2
are the columns e1,e2,t1,t2. Then
ε(Q) =
/integraltextQ
∞ρ1/integraltextQ
∞ρ2

embedsHintoC2/Λfor the lattice generated by these columns.
The Riemann Vanishing Theorem implies that there is some u0such thatθ(z) = 0if
and only if there is QinHwithz=u0−ε(Q)modulo Λ(see for example Corollary 3.6
of [  18  , p. 160]). In particular θ(u0) = 0(in fact because our His hyperelliptic we have
u0=e1+1
2e2+1
2t1+1
2t2, in1
2Λbut not Λ– see for example [  19  , 3.80, 3.82] – however if
we wanted to progress to curves of genus g≥3which are not hyperelliptic then we should
forget this explicit value).
Now the trouble with (  6.9  )and(  6.12  )is that theta functions tend to have two zeroes
when restricted to ε(H)(or even infinitely many, such as θ(u0−ε(Q))for example). We
can overcome this problem for S={P0}providedP0is not one of the six Weierstrass
points, which are ∞and the five points with y= 0on (  6.6  ). Namely consider
λ(P0)(Q) =θ(u0−2ε(P0) +ε(Q)).
This vanishes if and only if there is Q′inHwithu0−2ε(P0) +ε(Q) =u0−ε(Q′)modulo
Λ; that is
ε(Q) +ε(Q′) =ε(P0) +ε(P0) mod Λ.
If at least one of Q,Q′is notP0, then by Abel-Jacobi there is a rational function on
Hwith a double or single pole at P0and no other poles. However by the definition of
Weierstrass point that is impossible. Thus Q=P0(=Q′)and in particular λ(P0)is not
identically zero on H.
Thus (  6.9  ) and (  6.12  ) restricted to z=u0−2ε(P0) +ε(Q)provide functions
Φ(P0)
1,Φ(P0)
2,Φ(P0)
3,Φ(P0)
4
analytic onHS(for this singleton S) never vanishing there (also Weierstrass-Baker-
Akhiezer).POLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES OF SOLVABILITY 23
As for the periods, we have for example dΦ1/Φ1= dζ1and so the integral of Φ(P0)
1
around sayA1corresponds to the change in ζ1(u0−2ε(P0) +ε(Q)), which is zero by the
first of (  6.7  ). So we see that the periods of dΦ(P0)
1/Φ(P0)
1are
0,0,±2πi,0;
(depending on orientation) and likewise from (  6.8  ) the periods of dΦ(P0)
2/Φ(P0)
2are
0,0,0,±2πi.
And from (  6.10  ), (  6.11  ) we find that the periods of dΦ(P0)
3/Φ(P0)
3,dΦ(P0)
4/Φ(P0)
4are
±2πi,0,0,0
0,±2πi,0,0
respectively. So once again we get a matrix M0= 2πiUfor unimodular U. Thus any
function Φ, analytic onHSfor thisS={P0}and never vanishing there, has the form
(6.13) Φ = (Φ(P0)
1)m1(Φ(P0)
2)m2(Φ(P0)
3)m3(Φ(P0)
4)m4eϕ
forϕalso analytic onHS.
But what about S={P0}for a Weierstrass point P0? The above fails because λ(P0)is
then identically zero on Hthanks to the function xor1/(x−e)for the zeroes eof the
right-hand side of (  6.6  ).
IfP0=∞for example, then we could try to flip back into the construction in Section  3  ,
becauseρ1,ρ2,ρ3,ρ4can be taken as the well-known
(6.14)dx
y,xdx
y,x2dx
y,x3dx
y.
The right linear combinations appear to be connected to the “Legendre relations” of [  2  ,
p. 14], and then one would have to integrate and exponentiate. However the analogue of
(  6.14  ) for a Weierstrass point P0̸=∞seems messy.
Alternatively here is a dirty trick that works for any Weierstrass point P0. We choose
anyQ0not a Weierstrass point and as above
λ(Q0)(Q) =θ(u0−2ε(Q0) +ε(Q))
has a double zero at Q=Q0and no other zero. Similar arguments show that
µ(Q0)(Q) =θ(u0−ε(Q0)−ε(P0) +ε(Q))
has simple zeroes at Q=Q0,P0and no other zero. Thus (µ(Q0))2/λ(Q0)has a double zero
atQ=P0and no other zeroes or poles. And so
exp/parenleftig
2ζi(u0−ε(Q0)−ε(P0) +z)−ζi(u0−2ε(Q0) +z)/parenrightig
(i= 1,2)
are the analogues of (  6.9  ) for example.
And the new period matrix is just 2M0−M0=M0the old period matrix.24 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
This settles (  6.13  )for singletons S={P0}. For general S={P0,P1,...,Ps−1}(s≥2)
we write down the analogue of (  6.3  ) as
(6.15) Ψ(u)(z) =θ(z−u)
θ(z)eu1ζ1(z)+u2ζ2(z),u=
u1
u2
,
also quadruply periodic. If P̸=∞then
θ(u0−ε(P) +ε(Q))
vanishes at Q=P,∞and nowhere else. So if also P0̸=∞then taking z=u0−ε(P0)+ε(Q)
andu=ε(P)−ε(P0)in(  6.15  )we get a function Ψ(P0,P)analytic onHwithP0,Premoved
and never vanishing there (also Baker-Akhiezer).
Then dΨ(P0,P)/Ψ(P0,P)is a rational differential on Hwhose residue divisor is the divisor
P−P0ofΨ(P0,P)itself, and so integrating over a small loop around Pgives±2πi. In fact
it is onlyθ(z−u)in (  6.15  ) that causes the pole of the differential at P.
One could go further as in (  6.4  ) by using the “Baker ℘functions”
℘ij=−∂ζi
∂zj(i,j= 1,2)
and even℘ijk(not quite as in [  2  , p. 38] or [  11  , p. 99]), and this would lead to the
corresponding differentials (  3.4  ) onH.
Anyway, doing the above for P=P1,...,Ps−1leads to the usual unimodular matrix,
so we conclude that if S={P0,P1,...,Ps−1}does not contain ∞then any function Φ,
analytic onHSand never vanishing there, has the form

Presumably∞can be handled with more dirty tricks.
Probably these constructions extend to any genus g≥3, at least if P0,P1,...,Ps−1are
in “general position”.
7.Effectivity
Here we sketch some possibilities for effective versons of Theorem  1.1  . For simplicity we
restrict ourselves to genus g= 0.
The basic idea can be illustrated with n= 1andVinC×C∗defined byX1=ˆX1; so
we want a zero of Φ(z) =ez−z. We will localize in the sense of finding some explicit R
such that there is a zero z0with|z0|≤R. Of course there are many direct ways of doing
this, but they do not extend to general n.
So let us suppose to the contrary that for some R> 0there is noz0with Φ(z0) = 0and
|z0|≤R. Now the (classical) argument shows that Φ =eϕfor someϕanalytic on the disc
|z|≤R. So
ℜϕ(z) = log|ez−z|≤log(eR+R)POLYNOMIAL-EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS – SOME NEW CASES OF SOLVABILITY 25
on this disc.
Aseϕ(0)= Φ(0) = 1 we can assume ϕ(0) = 0. Then Lemma  2.2  withr=R/2gives
sup
|z|≤R/2|ϕ(z)|≤2 log(eR+R).
This says that|ϕ|=O(R)on “large” discs; thus ϕought to be “almost” a linear
polynomial az+b. More precisely if ϕ(z) =/summationtext∞
k=0akzkthen we could show that the
ak(k= 2,3,...)are “small”, so that Φ(z)is “near”eaz+b. As one might guess from (  1.8  )
in the discussion of Section  1  , this could be disproved with an appropriate “effective”
extension of Ax’s Theorem. In fact such an extension can be supplied; however here we
can take a short cut as follows.
We look at just
(7.1) |a2|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1
2πi/integraldisplay
|z|=R/2ϕ(z)
z3dz/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤8log(eR+R)
R2.
On the other hand (recall a0= 0)
(7.2) 1 +1
2z2+···=ez−z=eϕ(z)= 1 +a1z+/parenleftbigg
a2+1
2a2
1/parenrightbigg
z2+···
and we deduce a1= 0anda2= 1/2. This contradicts (  7.1  ) forR= 17.
Forn= 2and sayX1X2= 1,ˆX1+ˆX2= 1we propose to find Rsuch that there is a
zeroz0ofΦ(z) =ez+e1/z−1with 1/R≤|z0|≤R. Now we have to use Laurent series,
and we can show that Φ(z) =zmeϕ(z)holds as in (  1.11  )withϕ(z) =/summationtext∞
k=−∞akzk, and
thatakfork≥3andk≤−3are “small”. Thus ϕis nearaz2+bz+c+d/z+e/z2as in
(  1.12  ). This time a short cut by equating coefficients does not seem so easy as in (  7.2  ),
but “effective Ax” can be used, or also repeated differentiation (here five times suffice) to
deduce a contradiction for large R; provided we can also estimate the exponent m.
This latter problem seems not entirely trivial. If we take R> 1, then the method shows
that
(7.3) m=±1
2πi/integraldisplay
|z|=1dΦ
Φ.
We politely asked Maple to compute this but it refused to answer. Finally we realized
that this was due to zeroes z0with|z0|= 1. Writingz=eit, drawing a graph to guess a
rough solution and then refining with Newton gives indeed the pair
−0.08285557733006468223 ...±.9965615652358371338 ...i.
So we did actually stumble on zeroes!
Incidentally, this leads to a one-sentence proof that there is a zero, because Φ(eit)is
continuous from RtoRwith value 2e−1>0att= 0and value 2e−1−1<0att=π.
IfR > 2and for some reason we had taken say |z|= 2in(  7.3  )then Maple would
have obliged with something looking suspiciously like m= 1(and other more theoretical
considerations lead to a rigorous bound – we found |m|≤62for example). Such shady26 VINCENZO MANTOVA AND DAVID MASSER
calculations suggest that there is a pair of zeroes with 7<|z0|<8(our own value for R
was about 108).
