Abstract. AutoTAB is a state-of-the-art, fully automatic algorithm that tracks the Bipolar Magnetic Regions
(BMRs) in magnetogram observations. AutoTAB employs identified BMR regions from Line-of-Sight mag-
netograms from MDI and HMI (1996–2022) to track the BMRs through their evolution on the nearside of
the Sun. AutoTAB enables us to create a comprehensive and unique catalog of tracked information of
9232 BMRs in the mentioned time period. This dataset is used to study the collective statistical proper-
ties of BMRs and particularly to identify the correct theory for the BMR formation. Here, we discuss the
algorithm’s functionality and the initial findings obtained from the AutoTAB BMRs catalog.

1. Introduction
Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs) are the visible proxies of magnetic solar activity. The
sunspot pairs observed in white-light images of the Sun translate to opposite polarities of
BMRs as seen in Line-of-Sight (LOS) magnetic field observations. The number of BMRs
appearing on the solar disk shows a prominent cyclic behavior in accordance with the 11-year
solar cycle. These regions are observed to emerge in a tilted fashion with respect to solar E-
W direction (Hale et al. 1919). Evolution and dispersal of such regions on the surface, along
with the meridional flow, causes the reversal in the poloidal field of the Sun (Babcock 1961;
Leighton 1964; Karak 2020; Mordvinov et al. 2022; Golubeva et al. 2023). Consequently, the
investigation of BMRs, their origin, and their evolutionary dynamics has been a compelling
area of research in the past from both theoretical and observational perspectives (Karak and
Miesch 2017, 2018; Biswas et al. 2023).
A regular magnetic field observation of the Sun has been performed since the early 1970s
using ground-based solar observatories. In the last few decades, with the advancement of
space-based observatories/telescope, such as Michelson Doppler Image (MDI; Scherrer et al.
1995) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) we have been
provided with the continuous full disk LOS magnetograms from 1996 onwards. Since then,
magnetogram data has been used to monitor BMRs constantly to study solar magnetism
and to forecast solar eruptions. Diverse methods, including automated techniques, have been
developed for this purpose (Stenflo and Kosovichev 2012; Tlatov and Pevtsov 2014; Mu ˜noz-
Jaramillo et al. 2016). However, a consistent, calibrated catalog of tracked BMR information
for solar magnetism study is still absent. To address this, we introduce AutoTAB, an advanced
automatic tracking algorithm for BMRs (Sreedevi and Jha 2023; Sreedevi et al. 2023). In
Section 2, we explain the details and workings of the algorithm.

The theory behind the formation of BMRs is still debated. According to the thin-flux tube
model, BMRs are believed to be formed when magnetically buoyant flux tubes from the con-
vection zone rise up to the solar surface (Parker 1955). The diverging flows at the top of the
rising flux tubes will be subjected to Coriolis force to form the tilt in the BMRs (D’Silva and
Choudhuri 1993). However, backing for this study remains limited. Here, we utilize tracked
BMR data to assess the thin-flux tube model’s validity in explaining BMR emergence. Many
prior studies have explored this using various sunspot catalogs and before-mentioned auto-
mated methods (Wang and Sheeley 1991; Stenflo and Kosovichev 2012; Jha et al. 2020).
However, some of these studies treat each BMR detection as a new BMR. This approach may
introduce bias in analysis, as larger, longer-lasting BMRs contribute to a higher weightage.
Our study addresses this issue by actively tracking the BMRs.
2. Data and Method
In this study, we have used the full disk LOS magnetogram data with the cadence of 96
minutes for the period of September 1996–December 2022 (Cycles 23 and 24) from MDI
(1996–2011; Scherrer et al. 1995) and HMI (2010–present; Scherrer et al. 2012) onboard
the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory(SOHO) and Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO),
respectively. The BMRs are automatically identified using the method outlined in Stenflo and
Kosovichev (2012), as adapted with slight modification by Jha et al. (2020). The identified
BMRs are then saved as rectangular regions in the form of binary files. These rectangular
regions also include extra pixels that may not be part of the BMR, which can potentially affect
tracking efficiency, particularly in the case of closely lying BMRs. To isolate BMR boundaries
more accurately, a threshold of 100 G is used, followed by the morphological operations (using
morp close function in IDL) with circular kernels of different sizes on these pixels. Once the
boundaries of BMR are identified precisely, we extract morphological, magnetic, and location
information for each identified region.
AutoTAB utilizes binary masks of identified BMRs to track them during their appearance
on the near side of the Sun. The method of tracking is based on feature association similar
to the one used for sunspot tracking in Jha et al. (2021). A brief description of the tracking
algorithm follows: A BMR intended to be tracked is selected and isolated to a separate binary
file (BF-I) and assigned with a unique AutoTAB ID. From the positional information of the
BMR, we calculate the tracking period (T max), i.e., the time taken for the BMR to reach the
solar West limb. This indicates the duration during which AutoTAB will scan for isolated
BMR. Next, we gather all binary masks within the time period T max(BF-1, BF-2, etc.). Then,
BF-I is differentially rotated with respect to all the collected binary masks (BF-1, BF-2, etc.)
to evaluate the overlap between each of them. If the overlap is found to be greater than 150
pixels, those regions are identified with the same AutoTAB-ID. If the overlap condition is not
satisfied for the next two-day period of time, the overlap criterion is modified to 250 pixels
to ensure that the BMR tracked is the same one. A detailed description of the working of the
tracking algorithm and details of the pre-processing step is provided in Sreedevi et al. (2023).
Figure 1(a) is a representative example of the tracking of AutoTAB. It shows the evolution of
AR08048 (AutoTAB ID 10183) observed in MDI. This BMR was first identified near the East
limb (29 .7◦S, 44 .3◦E), and AutoTAB tracks it for the next seven days (in 65 observations)
till it starts decaying close to the West limb. The variation of total flux and Bmaxis shown in
Figure 1(b) over the tracking period.
3. Results
AutoTAB has successfully identified and tracked 9232 BMRs in Cycles 23 and 24 for the
time period between 1996–2022. On a closer look at the tracked BMRs, we find that BMRs
were tracked for a broad range of lifetimes, from hours to weeks, and over large flux ranges3

throughout their journey on the nearside of the Sun. BMR lifetime is defined as the duration for
which AutoTAB maintains tracking. In instances of poor tracking likely resulting from data
corruption or absence, those BMRs were excluded from the dataset. The remaining BMRs
were categorized into three distinct classes.
• Short-lived (SL): These are the BMRs that have a lifetime of less than 8 hours in the
nearside of the Sun. They are generally small BMRs with small areas within the flux range in
order of 1019or 1020Mx. Mostly, they are the ephemeral region, and a detailed study will be
done for this class in the follow-up manuscript.
• Diskpassage (DP): This class accommodates such BMRs that AutoTAB has tracked in its
evolutionary stages. That includes the BMRs that emerge in the nearside of the sun but continue
evolving in the farside beyond 45◦W, the BMRs that emerge on the far side and decay in the
nearside between 45◦E-W, and finally, the BMRs that emerge and decay on the far side. This
class contains bigger BMRs within the flux range of 1022Mx.
• Lifetime (LT): Any BMRs that emerge and decay in the nearside, between 45◦E-W,
constitutes this class. The lifespan of BMRs from this class is close to a week.
3.1. Statistical Behaviour of Tracked BMRs
To explore the statistical behavior of the tracked BMRs, we explore if the emergence of
BMRs obeys the expected solar cycle behavior by looking at well-known latitudinal time dis-
tribution in the form of a butterfly diagram. Figure 2 represents the butterfly diagram, and each
point represents each individually tracked BMR and the latitude of each BMR is determined
at its peak flux during tracking, and the same applies to other properties ( Bmax,Bmean, tilt). DP
and LT class BMRs conform to the butterfly wing pattern across the tracked years. A definite
wing-like pattern is not evident in the SL class as the points are scattered over all the latitudes at
all times, but we see their latitudes limited between ±60◦, suggesting that they are the byprod-
ucts of large-scale toroidal magnetic field (Karak and Brandenburg 2016). The monthly new
emergence of BMRs in each class exhibits a similar pattern. LT and DP class BMRs display
consistent solar cycle variations, aligning with fluctuations in the number of new emergences.
In the case of the SL class, we could not observe such behavior, and a sufficient number of
such BMRs were detected even during solar minima when the toroidal field of the sun is at
a minimum (See Figure 6 in Sreedevi et al. (2023)). The number of total BMRs tracked in
each class, along with their average magnetic properties, are listed in Table 1. A more detailed
description of the mentioned classes and their statistics is explored in Sreedevi et al. (2023).4

3.2. Viability of thin-flux tube model for explaining BMR emergence
In this section, we delve into an examination of whether the tracked information from
AutoTAB aligns with the expected outcomes proposed by the thin-flux tube model. The
thin-flux tube simulations by Fan et al. (1994) proposed the following empirical relation.
γ∝sinλB−5/4
0Φ1/4, (1)
where B0is the initial magnetic field strength in the flux tube, Φthe magnetic flux inside
the rising flux tubes. From this theory, it is expected that higher the initial magnetic field of
the tube, the more quickly flux tubes will rise to the surface, and the Coriolis force will have
less time to produce the tilt in BMRs. Furthermore, as the flux in the loop increases, tilt will
also increase due to the effect of drag force. A point to note here is that, in the simulation
studies, flux in the Ω-loop is independent of the initial magnetic field in the flux tube. From
the tracked BMR data, we indeed find a good correlation between the measured unsigned flux
andBmean. Also in the observations, the magnetic field values measured for the BMRs may not
be the same as the initial magnetic field of the BMR forming flux tube. Considering these, the
following are some of the observational evidence we can expect from the thin-flux tube model:
• The footpoint separation to increase over the BMR’s lifetime. The footpoint separation
here is defined as the great circle distance between the two polarities of the BMR. If the flux
tubes are rising, we should expect that the distance between the polarities should increase as
the BMR matures and gets saturated towards the end of life.
• If Coriolis force is the reason for tilted BMRs, then BMRs should emerge with tilt, and
we can expect well-defined Joy’s Law even from the initial phase of tracking.
• We can also assume that the measured unsigned flux within these regions will likely
influence their tilt characteristics.5

sents the sinusoidal fit for both the flux bins with fitting parameters mentioned in the panel. (b)
Mean tilt (and the error by shaded region) in each flux bin as a function of the absolute flux.
In the rest of the section, we assess each of the mentioned observations based on the
findings from AutoTAB within the framework of the thin-flux tube model.
The initial inspection of the tracked data of BMRs shows the familiar tilt distribution and
Joy’s Law relation as shown by previous studies (Dasi-Espuig et al. 2010; Wang and Sheeley
1991) (also see Figure 4 in Karak (2023)). To evaluate the flux dependence on tilt in the
data, BMRs were segregated based on their assigned flux strengths into two different bins,
1×1021Mx – 1 ×1022Mx (Bin-1) and 1 ×1022Mx – 1 ×1023Mx (Bin-2). Figure 3(a) shows
Joy’s law behavior in both the bins (Bin-1 in blue and Bin-2 in red) along with the sinusoidal
fit. Notably, a greater degree of Joy’s law scatter is evident for lower flux ranges, and the error
bars of fitting parameters overlap, failing to show a conclusive tilt dependency on the measured
flux of the BMR. In Figure 3(b), we further delve into flux dependency on tilt. Mean tilt values
of BMRs in flux bins of 5 ×1021Mx are depicted against absolute total flux, accompanied by
a fitted curve of the form γ= aφ1/4+ b. However, a strong tilt dependence on flux is not yet
apparent. A detailed study exploring this will be presented in our follow-up manuscript.
We now proceed to evaluate the typical evolution of BMR foot points over BMR’s lifetime.
For this, we standardize the lifespan of LT class BMRs relative to the longest-living BMR
within this class. Subsequently, we calculate the average foot point separation within each
normalized lifespan interval to assess the overall progression of footprint separation, which
is depicted in Figure 4(a). The figure shows a consistent rise in foot point separation during
the initial phase of BMR evolution, reaching saturation at approximately half of the BMR’s
lifespan. The observed sustained increase is in support of the thin-flux tube model.
Finally, in order to assess whether the BMRs exhibit definite tilt at an early stage of their
evolution, we compile all BMRs within the LT class. We then examine the behavior of Joy’s
law during the initial phase of these BMRs. To do this, we compute the average values of tilt
and emerging latitude within the initial 33% of their lifespan and evaluate Joy’s Law for this
period, as illustrated in Figure 4(b) in blue. As for DP class BMRs, we collect the BMRs that
emerge on the near side, calculate the average values of tilt and emerging latitude over the
entire tracking phase, and subsequently evaluate Joy’s law (Figure 4(b) in red). The results
indicate that during the initial phase of a BMR’s lifespan, Joy’s law is adhered to in both cases.
This suggests that BMRs already exhibit a distinct tilt even in the early stages of AutoTAB
tracking, which aligns with the findings of Kosovichev and Stenflo (2008) and supports the
thin-flux tube model.6

4. Conclusion
A statistical study of the evolving magnetic and morphological properties of BMRs is crucial
in the context of understanding solar magnetism. However, a comprehensive catalog of tracked
data of BMRs is limited. To address this, we introduce an automatic algorithm to track the
BMRs (AutoTAB). AutoTAB utilizes binary maps of identified bipolar regions and verifies
their overlap in subsequent time frames for tracking purposes. AutoTAB identifies and tracks
9232 BMRs in the period of 1996-2022. AutoTAB only tracks the BMR for their evolution
in the nearside of the Sun. Consequently, the dataset encompasses BMRs tracked throughout
their entire lifespan and those tracked only during their evolutionary stages.
The tracked BMRs were grouped into various classes based on their lifetime, namely, Short-
lived (lives for less than 8 hr), Lifetime (emerges and disperses on the visible surface), and Disk
passage (coming from and/or going to the far side of the Sun). The disk passage BMRs consti-
tute the bigger BMRs with higher flux contents, and the short-lived group consists of mostly
ephemeral regions. This dataset is further used to study the collective statistics of the BMRs.
Our analysis reveals that the tracked BMRs exhibits behavior consistent with typical solar
cycle patterns, with the emergence latitude of the BMRs at various times displaying butter-
fly wing-like patterns in latitude-time distribution plots. Furthermore, the tracked BMRs show
familiar tilt distribution and tilt-latitude plots agreeing with previous studies. Further analy-
ses were conducted to assess the validity of the thin-flux tube model for BMR formation. We
observe that foot point separation of the BMRs of the LT class increases over the initial phase
of their lifetime to saturate in the later phase, indicating the upward migration of magnetic
field bundles from the convection zone towards the surface. Our analysis shows a well-defined
Joy’s law pattern in the initial phase of tracking, suggesting that BMRs emerge with a definite
tilt. These findings support the thin-flux tube model. However, we do not find any strong and
conclusive dependence of tilt on the flux of the BMR. These ideas will be further explored in
the forthcoming article.
