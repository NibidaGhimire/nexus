Abstract
This study considers a variant of the bounded conﬁdence opin ion formation model wherein the probability of
opinion assimilation is dependent on the relative similari ty of opinions. Agents are located on a social network and
decide whether or not they adopt the opinion of one of the neig hbors (called a role agent). Opinion assimilation is
more (less) likely to occur when the distance from the opinio n of the role agent is smaller (larger) than the average
opinion distance from other neighbors. Thus, assimilation probability is reliant not only on opinion proximity with
the role agent considered in conventional models but also on relative similarity that considers other neighbors.
The simulation results demonstrate that large weights on re lative similarity in determining assimilation probabilit y
increase the size of the largest opinion cluster. The size of the threshold parameter of the bounded conﬁdence model
displays inverse-U relationships with the largest cluster size. The ﬁndings imply that consideration of relative opin ion
similarity, as observed in recent empirical studies, preve nts polarization into small opinion clusters.
Introduction
Opinion formation is an intriguing collective phe-
nomenon, where micro-level behavior is linked to macro-
level patterns. Social attributes, including opinions, ar e
formed through mutual social inﬂuence, such as confor-
mity [1, 2]. The accumulation of interactions leads to the
emergence of various types of opinion distribution such
as consensus and polarization. In this regard, opinion for-
mation models specify assumptions about the micro-level
process of social inﬂuence and examines the resultant
macro-level opinion distribution [3]. Researchers from
various ﬁelds of physical, social, and computational sci-
ences contribute to the understanding of the emergence
process of opinion distribution [3–5]. The framework is
also applied to topics of increasing importance such as the
emergence of echo chambers [6,7].
One of the widely examined opinion formation models
is the bounded conﬁdence model [8, 9]. In this model,
each individual has a continuous variable called an opin-
∗Electronic address: hir.takesue@gmail.comion, and may assimilate their opinions through interaction s
with other agents. An important element of this model is a
threshold parameter. In an interaction between two agents,
assimilation occurs only when the opinion distance be-
tween the two agents is smaller than the exogenous thresh-
old. Substantively, this assumption implies that extremel y
diﬀerent opinions are not considered in opinion updating.
Large (small) values of this threshold urge (hinder) the
assimilation of opinions. This dynamic process leads to
emergence of clusters of opinions, and the modiﬁcation
of opinions ceases once the opinion distance from agents
outside the cluster becomes greater than the threshold. As
a consequence, large threshold values generate small num-
bers of populous clusters, whereas small threshold values
lead to polarized states with many small clusters [8–10].
Realistic network structure is introduced to investigate i ts
role in the opinion formation [11–14].
An assumption shared by many opinion formation mod-
els is that the opinion distance between agents is an ab-
solute one (Ref. [15] is a notable exception that considers
relative similarity in modeling homophily). In pairwise
interactions, the opinion distance between two interactin g
1agents is calculated using the absolute diﬀerence in two
opinion values. An implication of this assumption is that
the opinions of other agents are not considered in calcu-
lating distance. Regardless of the opinions of others, the
distance from the interacting agent is perceived to be the
same. This fact can also play a role in the bounded con-
ﬁdence model, because the comparison between opinion
distance and the threshold value determines whether or
not opinion assimilations occur.
In contrast to this modeling assumption, recent empir-
ical studies demonstrated that the perception of the posi-
tion on (ideological) space is inﬂuenced by the opinion of a
third-party . A politically important example is the consid-
eration of an extreme candidate. When an extreme alter-
native is considered within an ideological spectrum, other
political actors are perceived to be more centrist [16, 17].
Moreover, extreme alternatives increase support for other
moderate policies [18]. The spatial voting model, which
is a canonical one in economics and political science, as-
sumes that people prefer closer alternatives in a political
space, because the distance of opinions decreases util-
ity [19]. Following this logic, the observations suggest
that the existence of other distant alternatives make peo-
ple perceive the positions of other alternatives as more
proximate.
Motivated by these ﬁndings, the current study consid-
ersrelative similarity in the bounded conﬁdence model.
In this model of opinion formation on a social network,
the opinion of an agent (called a focal agent) may assimi-
late into an opinion of one of the neighbors (called a role
agent). The classic models assume that whether or not
opinion assimilation occurs is dependent on the opinion
distance between the focal and role agents [3]. In con-
trast, this study assumes that the occurrence of opinion
assimilation is also dependent on the opinion distance be-
tween the focal agent and other neighbors on a network.
The modiﬁed opinion distance becomes smaller (larger)
when the distance from the opinion of the role agent is
smaller (larger) than the average distance from the opin-
ions of other neighbors. As a result, assimilation is more
likely to occur when the focal and role agents share a rel-
atively higher level of similarity than the focal agent and
other neighbors. This mechanism potentially leads to the
promotion and hindrance of opinion assimilation, because
similar (distant) opinions tend to be perceived as more
similar (distant).
Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the large in-
ﬂuence of relative similarity on the probability of assimi-lation increased the size of the largest opinion cluster and
generated less polarized opinion distribution. A scrutiny
of the simulation process suggested that large weights
on relative similarity foster the moderation of opinions,
that is, assimilation to center positions. Given the spe-
ciﬁc value of opinion distance between the focal and role
agents, assimilation into moderate opinion occurred with
a higher probability than assimilation into extreme opin-
ions. This bias toward moderation tendency helped the
emergence of large clusters. These results demonstrated
that the perception of opinion distance at the individual
level can inﬂuence macroscopic opinion distribution. The
literature proposed that small threshold values generate
many small opinion clusters, but the current study sug-
gests that this eﬀect can be oﬀset by a consideration of
relative similarity and that opinion distribution does not
easily become fragmented.
The study introduces heterogeneity to the opinion for-
mation process, because assimilation probability can dif-
fer given the same threshold value and opinion distance
from the role agent. Previous studies also considered
heterogeneity and demonstrated that the number of resul-
tant clusters decreases when agents possess heterogeneous
threshold levels [20–23], although a few exceptions may
exist [24]. Relatedly, scholars also examined the eﬀects
of stubborn or external agents who (tend to) stick to their
original opinions [22, 25–27]. The current study also as-
sumed that assimilation possibility is heterogeneous even
with constant opinion distance between paired agents. In
contrast to the abovementioned studies, this research in-
troduced dynamic heterogeneity generated by the opinion
distribution of neighbors.
Model
We considered a dynamic opinion formation process on
small-world networks [28], which were constructed as fol-
lows [29]. First, we generated an expanded cycle, where
Nagents were connected with z/2neighboring agents
on both sides. Second, we added random Nzp/2edges.
The average degree (i.e., number of neighboring agents)
isz(1 +p). Larger values of plead to the emergence of
more disordered networks. Small-world networks facili-
tate consensus in various opinion formation models that
assume opinion assimilation [30,31].
Each agent ( i) possesses a trait called an opinion, which
is denoted as oi. Opinions represent a position on a (po-
2litical) spectrum such as ideology and policy attitudes.
For instance, large (small) opinion values can correspond
to right (left) positions on an ideological spectrum. The
initial values of opinions are sampled from the standard
uniform distribution: U(0,1).
Agents can update their opinions through the interac-
tion process inspired by the bounded conﬁdence model.
For each round, one agent (the focal agent) is randomly se-
lected from the entire population, and one of the neighbors
(the role agent) is also randomly selected. The assimilatio n
of the opinion of the focal agent occurs with the following
probability:
pof←or= 1/[1+exp( β(ˆdfr−δ))],
whereˆdfris the modiﬁed opinion distance, which will be
explained below, and δis a threshold parameter. This set-
ting assumes that interactions with a more distant neighbor
decrease assimilation probability, but this distance is to ler-
ated byδ. In extreme cases, where β→∞ , the threshold
parameter δplays the same role as that in the conventional
bounded conﬁdence model, because assimilation proba-
bility changes from 1 to 0 when ˆdijexceedsδ. Scholars
frequently adopt this type of functional form to represent
a realistic noisy process of opinion adoption [32].
The modiﬁed opinion distance consists of two types of
distance. The ﬁrst is the distance between the opinion of
the focal agent ( of) and that of the role agent ( or). The
opinion distance between the two agents is denoted as dfr.
The second one is average opinion distance between the
focal agent and her neighbors (excluding the role agent).
It is calculated as dfNf=/summationtext
k∈Nf\r|of−ok|/(zf−1),
where summation runs over the neighborhood of the focal
agents (Nf), excluding the role agent, and zfis the degree
of the focal agent. Based on these values, the modiﬁed
distance is calculated as follows:
ˆdfr=dfr+α(dfr−dfNf).
The modiﬁed distance decreases (and assimilation prob-
ability increases) when the opinion distance between the
focal and role agents is smaller than the average distance
between the focal agent and her neighbors. At this point,
we introduce relative similarity in the model. The param-
eter,α(≥0), is a weight on this relative similarity, and
distance becomes a conventional one when α= 0. The
primary interest of the study is in examining the role of
this parameter.If opinion assimilation occurs, then the opinion of the
focal agent approaches that of the role agent. Speciﬁcally,
opinion updating occurs as follows:
of←of+µ(or−of),
whereµis the assimilation intensity. Scholars frequently
assume that the opinions of the two agents become the
same value after interaction [8]; therefore, the current
study assumes that µ= 1.
The focal agent adopts a random opinion with a small
probability ( pe) instead of interacting with others. In this
case, a new value of ofis sampled from U(0,1). Pre-
vious studies demonstrate that the polarized state with
multiple opinion clusters is fragile in the bounded con-
ﬁdence model (and other opinion formation models) if
agents are allowed to interact with individuals outside the
cluster with a (small) probability. Entirely homogeneous
states emerge even with a small threshold value in this
case [33, 34]. However, the original pattern is restored if
individuals adopt a random opinion with a small proba-
bility [34]. This noise prevents the emergence of entirely
homogeneous stats while allowing realistic noisy opinion
formation processes.
We examined the behavior of this model using Monte
Carlo simulation. The main quantity of interest is the
size of the largest opinion cluster divided by N, which is
denoted as Smax. This parameter is frequently adopted
as the order parameter [20–22]. The relaxing process
continued for at least 50 000 Nrounds. Moreover, the
sampling process continued for at least 300 000 Nrounds
to achieve statistical accuracy. We conducted at least 10
simulation runs for each combination of parameter values
and reported the mean values of these runs.
Results
The ﬁrst analysis reported in Figure 1 examined the behav-
ior of the model without relative similarity (i.e., α= 0).
The threshold parameter ( δ) illustrates the expected eﬀects
onSmaxin the same manner as the orthodox bounded con-
ﬁdence model despite diﬀerences in the detailed model
speciﬁcation. Large δvalues permit opinion assimilation
with distant individuals and contributes to the emergence
of large opinion clusters. This pattern is prominent with
a small noise (large β). The decreasing eﬀects of δis
observed, and the values of Smaxfails to reach one due to
the random adoption of opinions. However, the basic role

suﬃciently large to conﬁrm the eﬀect of δ. Thus, we set
the value of βto 10 in the following analysis.

larity leads to large opinion clusters. This ﬁgure reports

ter, namely, weight on relative similarity ( α), for diﬀerent

the largest cluster. We examined the cases with larger α
values that are not reported in the ﬁgure and conﬁrmed that
eﬀect ofαis monotonically positive (despite decreasing
eﬀect size) at least when α≤2. The ﬁgure also illustrates
that the positive eﬀect of αis more prominent with a small

Figure 3 reports the relationships between Smaxand the
threshold parameter ( δ). In contrast to the pattern in Fig-
ure 1 and the conventional model, we did not necessarily
observe the monotonic positive eﬀect of δ. As the value
ofαis suﬃciently large (0.1 in Figure 3), Smaxfrequently
decreases with the increase in δ. We observed the small
eﬀects of αas a result of this decreasing trend. With fur-
ther large δvalues that are not reported in the ﬁgure (e.g.,
δ= 2), the eﬀects of αbecome nearly negligible. Large
tolerance levels solely determine the assimilation proba-
bility, and the contribution of α(and modiﬁed opinion
distance) to assimilation probability decreases.
The next analysis focuses on the underlying mechanism
of the pattern, that is, the weight on relative similarity ex -
erts positive eﬀects on the largest cluster size. Speciﬁcal ly,
we focus on the opinion moderation tendency with pos-
itiveαvalues. We call the scenario opinion moderation
(extremization), when an opinion moves closer to (away
from) the center position (i.e., 0.5). If the opinion positi on
of the role agent is closer to (far from) the center than the
original position of the focal agent, then it is the oppor-
tunity of moderation (extremization). We calculated the
probability of opinion assimilation by dividing the num-
ber of realized opinion moderation (extremization) by that
of moderation (extremization) opportunities. We call this
probability of opinion moderation (extremization) as pmod
(pext).
Figure 4 reports bias toward opinion moderation with
positiveα. Panel (a) of the ﬁgure reports pmod−pextas
a function of the absolute opinion diﬀerence between the
focal and role agents. The case of α= 0illustrates that

port the frequencies of assimilation opportunities. The st udy
conducted 1500 (500) simulation runs for the cases of δ= 0.8
andα= 0.2(other parameter values). Each run continued
for 20 000 rounds. We recorded the number of opportunities
and realizations of opinion assimilation by the values of op in-
ion distance between the two agents. Opinion distance was
grouped in the range of 0.025. The other parameters include
N= 5000,z= 4,p= 0.02,β= 10 andpe= 10−4.
the moderation and extremization of opinions occurred
without bias. In contrast, opinion moderation was more
likely to occur given a speciﬁc opinion distance when
α >0. This fact could contribute to the emergence of a
large opinion cluster through the accumulation of opinions
near the center position.
This bias may also be related to the attenuated eﬀects
ofαwith large δ. A comparison of cases with the same
αvalue (0.2) but diﬀerent δvalues (0.1 and 0.8) in Panel
(a) indicates that bias takes the maximum values with dif-
ferent values of opinion distance. Moreover, this factor
could inﬂuence cluster size through diﬀerent frequencies
of opinion modiﬁcations. Panels (b) and (c) report the
frequency of moderation and extremization opportunities.
In the cases of positive α, assimilation opportunities oc-
cur with high frequencies when the focal and role agents
share similar opinions. This pattern is observed regardles s
of the direction of movement. Bias toward moderation is
observed with relatively large diﬀerences in opinion in the
case ofδ= 0.8(Panel (a)), but less assimilation oppor-
tunities are observed between distant opinions (panels (b)
and (c)). As a result, the eﬀects of moderation tendency
become weak with a large threshold, which may explain
the small Smaxwith large δ.

stood using a simple example of initial states, where opin-
ions follow a uniform distribution. The average opinion
distance from other agents takes the minimum values at the
center position and increases as the opinion moves away
from the center. Therefore, agents near the center tend
to possess relatively similar opinions when they become
role agents. The shape of opinion distribution changes
through the dynamic process, and this inference is not di-
rectly applicable to this process. However, the advantage
of the center position can persist given that opinions are
not skewed on both ends.
Finally, we changed the values of the other parame-
ters and examined the robustness of the reported patterns.
Figure 5 reports results with diﬀerent values of p, which
controls the number of added links in generating small-
world networks. A comparison of the panels indicates
that large p(more disordered networks) tend to give rise
to larger clusters. This observation is consistent with the
ﬁndings that disordered networks are more likely to reach
consensus [30, 31]. Importantly, the ﬁgure replicates the
basic reported patterns, that is, the weight on relative sim i-
larity (α) increases Smax, whereas the tolerance parameter
(δ) exhibits non-monotonic eﬀects.
We also conducted simulations with diﬀerent values of
pe, that is, the probability of adopting random opinions
(Figure 6). The overall patterns suggested that a decrease
inpeleads to larger Smax(notably, the scale of y-axis
diﬀers between the two panels). This result is natural,
because the errors dismantle the existing clusters. In the
special cases of pe= 0, the system always converged
to entirely homogeneous opinion distributions, because

positive probability [34]. We also conﬁrmed the results
reported in this work: the positive eﬀects of αand non-
monotonic eﬀects of δ.
Conclusion
The study examined the role of relative similarity in an
opinion formation model. In the model, probability of
opinion assimilation is dependent not only on the opinion
of a role agent, whose opinion may be imitated, but also
the opinions of other neighbors in the networks. Speciﬁ-
cally, assimilation probability increases (decreases) wh en
the opinion distance from the role agent is smaller (larger)
than the average distance from other neighbors. As a re-
sult, opinion assimilation of the opinion of the role agent
is more likely to occur when she has a relatively similar
opinion. The simulations demonstrated that larger weights
on this relative similarity give rise to the increase in the
size of the largest cluster. The threshold parameter in
the bounded conﬁdence model depicted non-monotonic
eﬀects wherein the size of the largest cluster reaches its
maximum value with a moderate value of the threshold
parameter. These patterns can be explained by the ten-
dency toward opinion moderation with positive weights
on relative similarity. Given the opinion distance from the
role agent, opinion assimilation toward the center posi-
tion occurs with a higher probability than that toward the
extreme positions.
The proposed model suggests that opinion distributionis not easily fragmented once the opinion of neighbors
is considered in determining distance. The underlying
mechanism of this observation is consistent with those of
recent empirical studies. A recent study ﬁnds that the ex-
istence of other extreme alternatives increases the suppor t
for other policies that lie at the (relatively) centrist pos i-
tion [18]. In the simulation process, positive weights on
relative opinion similarity generate the moderation ten-
dency of opinion assimilation. Although the model did
not explicitly assume the popularity of the centrist opin-
ion, a consideration of relative similarity renders centri st
opinions more attractive.
Lastly, we discuss the limitations and potential exten-
sion of this study. The model is not the sole method
for considering relative similarity, such that diﬀerent se t-
tings should be considered. This study applied relative
similarity in calculating opinion assimilation probabili ty.
However, a possibility existed that the magnitude of opin-
ion change is also aﬀected. In addition, the robustness of
the results must be considered when combined with other
factors. In this model, the emergence of the large clus-
ter was fostered by opinion moderation. Other opinion
formation models introduced repulsive opinion modiﬁca-
tion [35–38]. Relatedly, stubborn agents [25, 27, 39, 40]
and multiple opposing mass media [26, 31] can induce
polarization. Thus, the role of relative similarity can be
examined when combined with the mechanism that acts
in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the idea of rela-
tive similarity can be applied to other opinion formation
models given that opinion distance is deﬁned. Candi-
dates are continuous opinions [41, 42], ordered discrete
opinions [43, 44], and opinions consisting of a vector of
(unordered) attributes [45]. The eﬀects of relative simi-
larity may depend on the types of opinion models. In this
regard, the consideration of relative similarity is an empi r-
ically observed phenomenon, and further examining the
inﬂuence of the this factor on opinion formation processes
may be meaningful.
