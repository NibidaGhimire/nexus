Abstract
This work explores various manifestations of bumblebee gravity within the metric–affine for-
malism. We investigate the impact of the Lorentz violation parameter, denoted as X, on the
modification of the Hawking temperature. Our calculations reveal that as Xincreases, the values
of the Hawking temperature attenuate. To examine the behavior of massless scalar perturbations,
specifically the quasinormal modes, we employ the WKB method. The transmission and reflec-
tion coefficients are determined through our calculations. The outcomes indicate that a stronger
Lorentz–violating parameter results in slower damping oscillations of gravitational waves. To com-
prehend the influence of the quasinormal spectrum on time–dependent scattering phenomena, we
present a detailed analysis of scalar perturbations in the time–domain solution. Additionally, we
conduct an investigation on shadows, revealing that larger values of Xcorrespond to larger shadow
radii. Furthermore, we constrain the magnitude of the shadow radii using the EHT horizon–scale
image of SgrA∗. Finally, we calculate both the time delay and the deflection angle.

1arXiv:2305.18871v2  [gr-qc]  26 Dec 2023I. INTRODUCTION
The problem of consistently implementing Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) within
the gravitational framework is fundamentally different from constructing Lorentz–breaking
extensions for non–gravitational field theories. While flat spacetimes can accommodate
Lorentz–breaking additive terms like Carroll–Field–Jackiw [1], aether time [2], and others
(see, for example, [3]), these constructions cannot be readily applied to curved spacetimes.
In flat spacetime, constant tensors can be well–defined, allowing for simple conditions such
as∂µkν= 0. However, in curved spacetimes, these conditions cannot be introduced in an
analogous manner. The non–covariant condition ∂µkν= 0 is not suitable, and its covariant
extension ∇µkν= 0 imposes severe restrictions on spacetime geometries (known as the no–
go constraints [4]). Therefore, the most natural way to incorporate local Lorentz violation
into gravitational theories is through the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In
this case, Lorentz/CPT violating coefficients (operators) arise as vacuum expectation values
(VEV) of dynamical tensor fields, which are driven by nontrivial potentials.
The generic effective field framework that describes all possible coefficients for
Lorentz/CPT violation is the well–known Standard Model Extension (SME) [5]. The grav-
itational sector of SME is defined in a Riemann–Cartan manifold, where the torsion is
treated as a dynamic geometric quantity alongside the metric. However, despite the non–
Riemannian background, most studies in bumblebee gravity, for example, have been con-
ducted within the metric approach of gravity, where the metric is the only dynamical geo-
metric field. These investigations focus on obtaining exact solutions for different models that
incorporate LSB in curved spacetimes, including bumblebee gravity [6–13], parity–violating
models [14–18], and Chern–Simons modified gravity [19–21].
While the majority of works in the literature on modified theories of gravity employ the
metric approach, it is interesting to explore more general geometric frameworks. Motiva-
tions for considering theories of gravity in Riemann–Cartan background include, allowing
for the possibility of having gravitational topological terms [22]. Another intriguing non–
Riemannian geometry that has garnered attention is Finsler geometry [23], which has been
linked to LSB in recent years through various studies [24–28].
However, the most compelling generalization of the metric approach is the metric–affine
formalism, where the metric and connection are treated as independent dynamic geometric
2quantities. Despite this formalism significance, LSB remains relatively unexplored in the
literature. Recent works involving bumblebee gravity have started to address this gap within
the metric–affine approach [29–33].
Understanding gravitational waves and their characteristics is essential for studying vari-
ous physical processes, including cosmological events in the early universe and astrophysical
phenomena like the evolution of stellar oscillations [34–36] and binary systems [37–40]. Grav-
itational waves exhibit a range of intensities and characteristic modes, and their spectral
properties depend on the phenomena that generate them [41]. Of particular interest is the
emission of gravitational waves from black holes. When a black hole forms through the
gravitational collapse of matter, it enters a perturbed state and emits radiation that in-
cludes a bundle of characteristic frequencies unrelated to the collapse process [42]. These
perturbations with distinct frequencies are referred to as quasinormal modes [43, 44].
The investigation of quasinormal modes of black holes has extensively utilized the weak
field approximation in the literature, both in general relativity (GR) [42, 44–57] and in
alternative gravity theories such as Ricci–based theories [58–60], Lorentz violation [61, 62],
and related fields [63–67].
Significant progress has been made in the development of gravitational wave detectors, en-
abling the detection of gravitational waves emitted from various physical phenomena [68–71].
Ground–based interferometers like VIRGO, LIGO, TAMA–300, and EO–600 have played
crucial roles in these detections [72–75]. Over the years, these detectors have improved their
accuracy, approaching the desired sensitivity range [76]. These detections have provided
valuable insights into the composition of astrophysical objects, including boson stars and
neutron stars.
The detection of gravitational waves has a significant connection to black hole physics.
The emitted gravitational radiation from a perturbed black hole carries a unique signature
that allows for direct observations of their existence [77]. Early studies on black hole pertur-
bations were conducted by Regge and Wheeler, who examined the stability of Schwarzschild
black holes [78], followed by Zerilli’s work on perturbations [79, 80].
The study of gravitational solutions involving scalar fields has received significant at-
tention in recent years due to their notable and peculiar characteristics. These intriguing
aspects have led to the emergence of various astrophysical applications. Notably, black
holes (BHs) with nontrivial scalar fields challenge the well–known “no–hair theorem” [81].
3Additionally, the existence of long–lived scalar field patterns [82], the formation of boson
stars [83–85], and the exploration of exotic astrophysical scenarios in the form of gravastars
[86–88] have all stemmed from this line of research. Moreover, by considering Klein–Gordon
scalar fields on curved backgrounds, a wide range of phenomena can be derived, including
black hole bombs [89–91] and superradiance [92].
In this study, we thoroughly investigate bumblebee gravity within the metric–affine for-
malism, examining its diverse manifestations and shedding light on its intriguing properties.
Our analysis encompasses the modification of the Hawking temperature, the behavior of
quasinormal modes, the influence on time–dependent scattering phenomena, the analysis
of shadows, the exploration of time delay. We reveal the correlation between bumblebee
gravity and thermodynamic properties, with the Hawking temperature attenuating as the
Lorentz violation parameter increases. Furthermore, our investigation highlights the dis-
tinct influence of bumblebee field on gravitational wave damping, with slower oscillations
observed under stronger Lorentz violation. The analysis of shadows provides valuable in-
sights, demonstrating larger shadow radii associated with higher values of the parameter.
Additionally, we provide the analysis of the time delay in this scenario.
II. THE GENERAL SETUP AND HAWKING TEMPERATURE
In this section, we begin by introducing a metric–affine generalization of the gravitational
sector found in the SME [5]. Like the metric formulation, the action of this sector can be
expressed in the following manner
S=1
2κ2ˆ
d4x√−g
(1−u)R(Γ) + sµνRµν(Γ) + tµναβRµναβ(Γ)	
+Smat(gµν, ψ) +
+Scoe(gµν, u, sµν, tµναβ). (1)
Here, we have gµνas the covariant metric tensor, gµνas the contravariant metric tensor,
and the determinant of the metric is given by g= det( gµν). In this formulation, we express
the action as follows, incorporating various geometric quantities. The Ricci scalar R(Γ)≡
gµνRµν(Γ), Ricci tensor Rµν(Γ), and Riemann tensor Rµ
ναβ(Γ) play key roles. Additionally,
Smatrepresents the action that accounts for the contributions of matter sources, which are
4assumed to be coupled solely to the metric1. As previously mentioned, we adopt the metric–
affine formalism, wherein the metric and connection are regarded as independent dynamical
entities a priori .
Moreover, the coefficients (fields) u=u(x),sµν=sµν(x), and tµναβ=tµναβ(x) play a
crucial role in explicitly breaking local Lorentz symmetry, as extensively discussed in Ref.
[5]. It is important to note that the background field sµνpossesses the same symmetries as
the Ricci tensor. However, for the purposes of this study, we assume it to be a symmetric
second–rank tensor, denoted as sµν=s(µν). Therefore, it couples exclusively to the sym-
metric component of the Ricci tensor. On the other hand, tµναβshares the symmetries of
the Riemann tensor. Lastly, the final term in Eq. (1), denoted as Scoe, encompasses the
dynamical contributions stemming from the Lorentz–violating coefficients.
In this study, our primary focus lies on investigating the nontrivial consequences of
Lorentz symmetry breaking, which involve both the Ricci tensor and scalar. Consequently,
we impose constraints such that the coefficients sµνandutake nonzero values, while setting
tµναβ= 0. This choice is motivated by the fact that the connection equation cannot be
straightforwardly solved through a simple metric redefinition when a nontrivial parameter
tµναβis present. This issue is commonly referred to as the “t–puzzle” [93, 94]. Thus, the
action of interest can be expressed as follows:
S=1
2κ2ˆ
d4x√−g{(1−u)R(Γ) + sµνRµν(Γ)}+Smat+Scoe. (2)
It is important to emphasize that the aforementioned action exhibits invariance under pro-
jective transformations of the connection
Γµ
να−→Γµ
να+δµ
αAν. (3)
Under the this transformation described by Eq. (3), where Aαrepresents an arbitrary vector,
it can be readily verified that the Riemann tensor undergoes the following change:
Rµ
ναβ−→Rµ
ναβ−2δµ
ν∂[αAβ]. (4)
Consequently, it follows that the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor remains invariant under
the transformation described by Eq. (3), along with the entire action (2). The model
1It is worth noting that fermions naturally couple to the connection. However, for convenience, we omit
consideration of spinors in this discussion and focus solely on bosonic matter sources that are minimally
coupled to the metric.
5presented by the action (2) belongs to a broader class of gravitational theories known as
Ricci–based theories [95, 96]. It has been demonstrated that within this class of models, the
property of projective invariance prevents the appearance of ghost–like propagating degrees
of freedom in gravity.

where we have used the shorthand notation: X=˜ξb2,bµis the vacuum expectation value
of the bumblebee field Bµ, i.e., < B µ>=bµ, and ˜ξis a dimensionless parameter. Note that
the line element in Eq. (5) describes a LSB modified Schwarzschild metric.
The historical foundations of the thermodynamic interpretation of gravity trace back to
the pioneering research of the mid–1970s, notably by Bekenstein [97–99] and Hawking [100]
on the thermodynamics of black holes. In 1995, Jacobson made a significant advancement
in our understanding by demonstrating that the Einstein field equations, the fundamental
mathematical framework characterizing relativistic gravitation, can be derived from the
amalgamation of overarching thermodynamic principles and the foundational concept of the
equivalence principle [101]. This groundbreaking revelation marked a pivotal milestone in the
synthesis of gravitational theory and thermodynamics. Subsequent to this critical research,
Padmanabhan further explored the link between gravity and the concept of entropy [102].
In the context of the thermodynamic properties, the unique geometric quantity that will
be affected is the Hawking temperature

where rsis the Schwarzschild radius. This thermal quantity, as shown in Fig. 1, illustrates
the relationship between Lorentz–violating parameters and the respective temperatures. It
is evident that as Xincreases, the corresponding Hawking temperatures become increasingly
attenuated. It is important to mention that the thermodynamic aspects were calculated for
a variety contexts, including cosmological scenarios [103–114] and more [115–118].

III. THE QUASINORMAL MODES
During the ringdown phase, an intriguing phenomenon known as quasinormal modes be-
comes evident. These modes exhibit characteristic oscillation patterns that are independent
of the initial perturbations and instead reflect the intrinsic properties of the system. This
remarkable behavior arises from the fact that the quasinormal modes correspond to the free
oscillations of spacetime itself, unaffected by the specific initial conditions.
In contrast to the normal modes, which are associated with closed systems, the quasi-
normal modes are linked to open systems. Consequently, these modes gradually lose energy
by radiating gravitational waves. Mathematically, the quasinormal modes can be described
as the poles of the complex Green function.
To determine the frequencies of the quasinormal modes, we need to find solutions to
the wave equation for a system described by a background metric gµν. However, analytical
solutions for such modes are generally unattainable.
Numerous techniques have been proposed in scholarly works to derive solutions for the
quasinormal modes. Among these methods, the WKB (Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin) ap-
proach stands out as one of the most renowned. Its inception can be traced back to Will
and Iyer [119, 120], and subsequent advancements up to the sixth order were made by Kono-
plya [121]. For our calculations, we specifically focus on investigating perturbations utilizing
the scalar field. Consequently, we formulate the Klein–Gordon equation in the context of a
curved spacetime
1√−g∂µ(gµν√−g∂νΦ) = 0 . (7)
7While the exploration of backreaction effects is intriguing in this particular scenario,
this manuscript focuses on other aspects and does not delve into this feature. Instead, our
attention is directed towards studying the scalar field as a minor perturbation. Furthermore,
given the presence of spherical symmetry, we can exploit the opportunity to decompose the
scalar field in a specific manner, as outlined below:
Φ(t, r, θ, φ ) =∞X
l=0lX
m=−lr−1Ψlm(t, r)Ylm(θ, φ), (8)
where the spherical harmonics are represented by Ylm(θ, φ). By substituting the scalar field
decomposition, as given in Eq. (8), into Eq. (7), we arrive at a Schr¨ odinger–like equation.
This transformed equation exhibits wave–like characteristics, making it suitable for our
analytical investigation
−∂2Ψ
∂t2+∂2Ψ
∂r∗2+Veff(r∗)Ψ = 0 . (9)
The potential Veffis commonly referred to as the Regge–Wheeler potential, also known as
the effective potential. It contains valuable information regarding the geometry of the black
hole. Additionally, we introduce the tortoise coordinate r∗(running r∗→ ±∞ all over the
spacetime) as d r∗=p
−g11/g00dr, which reads
r∗=s 

In the left panel of Fig. 2, we depict the behavior of the effective potential Veffas a
function of r∗for different values of lwhile maintaining a fixed value of X(X= 0.5). On
the right panel of Fig. 2, we present the behavior for a constant value of l(l= 1) while
varying the parameter Xacross different values.
The figure also showcases the modifications induced by parameter X, which triggers the
Lorentz violation. It is worth noting that the tortoise coordinate r∗is a transcendental
function of r, and making a “parametric plot” is the only way to visualize Veffagainst r∗.
As it is expected, if we consider the limit where X→0, we recover the simplest spherically
symmetric black hole, i.e., the Schwarzschild case.

A. The WKB method
In this section, our objective is to derive stationary solutions, characterized by the as-
sumption that Ψ( t, r) can be written as Ψ( t, r) =e−iωtψ(r), where ωrepresents the fre-
quency. By adopting this assumption, we can effectively separate the time–independent
component of Eq. (9) in the following manner:
∂2ψ
∂r∗2−
ω2−Veff(r∗)
ψ= 0. (12)
In order to solve Eq. (12), it is crucial to take into account the appropriate boundary
conditions. In our particular scenario, the solutions that satisfy the desired conditions are
those which exhibit pure ingoing behavior near the horizon. This concept is illustrated
below:
ψin(r∗)∼

Cl(ω)e−iωr∗(r∗→ −∞ )
A(−)
l(ω)e−iωr∗+A(+)
l(ω)e+iωr∗(r∗→+∞),(13)
The complex constants Cl(ω),A(−)
l(ω), and A(+)
l(ω) play a significant role in the following
discussion. In general, the quasinormal modes of a black hole can be defined as the fre-
quencies ωnlfor which A(−)
l(ωnl) = 0. This condition ensures that the modes correspond to
a purely outgoing wave at spatial infinity and a purely ingoing wave at the event horizon.
Here, the integers nandlrepresent the overtone and multipole numbers, respectively. The
spectrum of quasinormal modes is determined by the eigenvalues of Eq. (12). To analyze
these modes, we employ the WKB method, i.e., a semi–analytical approach that capitalizes
on the analogy with quantum mechanics.
The application of the WKB approximation to calculate the quasinormal modes in the
context of particle scattering around black holes was initially introduced by Schutz and
9Will [122]. Subsequently, Konoplya made further advancements in this technique [121, 123].
However, it is important to note in order to make this method valid, the potential must
exhibit a barrier–like shape, approaching constant values as r∗→ ±∞ . By fitting the power
series of the solution near the turning points of the maximum potential, the quasinormal
modes can be obtained [46]. The Konoplya formula for calculating them is expressed as
follows:
i(ω2
n−V0)p
−2V′′
0−6X
j=2Λj=n+1
2. (14)
In the aforementioned expression, Konoplya’s formula for the quasinormal modes incorpo-
rates several key elements. The term V′′
0represents the second derivative of the potential
evaluated at its maximum point r0, while Λ jconstants that depend on the effective potential
and its derivatives at the maximum. Notably, it is important to mention that a recent devel-
opment in the field introduced a 13th–order WKB approximation, as proposed by Matyjasek
and Opala in the literature [124].
Tables I, II, and III present the quasinormal frequencies calculated using the sixth–order
WKB method for different values of the parameter X. The tables are specifically divided
based on the multipole number l, with Table I corresponding to l= 0, Table II to l= 1,
and Table III to l= 2.
Importantly, it is noteworthy that the modes associated with the scalar field exhibit
negative values in their imaginary part. This indicates that these modes decay exponentially
over time, representing the dissipation of energy through scalar waves. These findings align
with previous studies investigating scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations
in spherically symmetric geometries [42, 43, 48, 125].
In our investigation, we have observed a decrease in the absolute values of imaginary
parts of the quasinormal modes as Lorentz–violating parameter increases in general. The
parameter Xplays a critical role in this scenario as it governs the damping of the scalar
waves. Depending on the its value, the damping can occur at a faster or slower rate.
In Fig. 3, we present a plot showcasing the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal
frequencies as a function of the WKB order. Throughout the plot, we maintain the multipole
and overtone numbers fixed at l= 0 and n= 0, respectively. It is evident that in all cases,
the real and imaginary parts of ω0exhibit convergence as the WKB order increases. This
convergence serves as an indication of the effectiveness of such an approach in providing
10accurate approximations for the quasinormal modes.
Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that increasing the number of WKB orders does
not guarantee convergence in general, as the WKB series converges asymptotically. Thus,
while the method proves reliable in this particular scenario, caution should be exercised
when applying it to other cases.

An additional crucial aspect to consider is the utilization of the WKB method for studying
scattering, which necessitates appropriate boundary conditions. In this context, our objec-
tive is to determine the reflection and transmission coefficients, which bear resemblance to
those encountered in quantum mechanics for tunneling phenomena. To compute these coef-
ficients, we take advantage of the fact that ( ω2

in the field [126–128]. These coefficients are associated with the effective potential and

efficients are displayed, respectively, for various values of the Lorentz–violating parameter
and multipole numbers. Notably, it is observed that for a fixed value of X, increasing the
multipole number lresults in a rightward shift of the transmission coefficients. Conversely,
when lis kept constant and Xis increased, the reflection coefficients shift in the opposite

This observation aligns with findings from previous studies [43, 127, 128].
IV. TIME–DOMAIN SOLUTION
To thoroughly investigate the impact of the quasinormal spectrum on time–dependent
scattering phenomena, a detailed analysis of scalar perturbations in the time domain is
necessary. However, given the intricacy of our effective potential, a more precise approach
is required to gain deeper insights. In this regard, we employ the characteristic integration
method developed by Gundlach and collaborators [129] as an effective tool to study the
problem effectively. By utilizing this approach, we can acquire valuable insights into the
role of quasinormal modes in time–dependent scattering scenarios, which have significant
implications for the investigation of black holes and related phenomena.
The methodology presented in Ref. [129] revolves around the utilization of light–cone
14coordinates, represented by u=t−xandv=t+x. These coordinates enable the re-
formulation of the wave equation in a more suitable manner, allowing for a comprehensive
examination of the system

4∂2
∂u∂v+V(u.v)
Ψ(u, v) = 0 . (18)
To achieve efficient integration of the aforementioned expression, a discretization scheme can
be employed, making use of a simple finite–difference method and numerical techniques. This
approach allows for the effective numerical integration of the equation, providing accurate
and efficient results
Ψ(N) =−Ψ(S) + Ψ( W) + Ψ( E)−h2
8V(S)[Ψ(W) + Ψ( E)] +O(h4), (19)
where S= (u, v),W= (u+h, v),E= (u, v+h), and N= (u+h, v+h), where hrepresents the
overall grid scale factor. The null surfaces u=u0andv=v0are of particular significance,
as they serve as locations where the initial data are specified. In our investigation, we have
chosen to employ a Gaussian profile centered at v=vcwith a width of σ, which is selected
on the null surface u=u0
Ψ(u=u0, v) =Ae−(v−v∗)2/2σ2,Ψ(u, v0) = Ψ 0. (20)
Atv=v0, a constant initial condition Ψ( u, v0) = Ψ 0was imposed, and without loss of
generality, we assume Ψ 0= 0. The integration process then proceeds along the u=const.
lines in the direction of increasing v, once the null data are specified.
Furthermore, the results of our investigation into the scalar test field are presented in
this study. For the sake of convenience, we set m= 1, and the null data were defined by
a Gaussian profile centered at u= 10 on the u= 0 surface, with a width of σ= 3, and
Ψ0= 0. The grid was established to cover the ranges u∈[0,200] and v∈[0,200], with grid
points sampled to yield an overall grid factor of h= 0.1.
To validate our findings, we present Fig. 6, which showcases the typical evolution profiles
for different combinations of Xandl, allowing for a visual comparison and analysis of the
results.

V. SHADOWS
To investigate the effects of the Lorentz violation of Eq. (5) in the shadows, we consider
∂S
∂τ=−1

where Sis the Jacobi action and τis the arbitrary affine parameter. Also, above expression
can be decomposed as
S=1
2m2τ−Et+Lϕ+Sr(r) +Sθ(θ). (22)
We can mathematically represent Sr(r) and Sθ(θ) as functions that depend on the variables
randθ, respectively. Since we are interested in the photon behavior, as a consequence, the
energy Eand angular momentum Lbecome constants of motion. By utilizing Eqs. (21) and
(22), we can derive the equations governing the path of the photon, known as null geodesic

The symbol Krepresents the Carter constant [130]. In Eq. (25), the plus and minus signs
correspond to the photon’s motion in the outgoing and ingoing radial directions, respectively.
For simplicity and without loss of generality, we fix the angle θtoπ/2 and restrict our analysis
to the equatorial plane. With this simplification, our attention turns to the radial equation,
where we introduce the concept of an effective potential Veff(r)

17To determine the shadow radius, we will utilize the celestial coordinates αandβ[131],
which are connected to the constants of motion as follows: α=−ξandβ=±√η. With
these coordinates, the shadow radius can be expressed as:

It is obvious that the Eq. (35) recovers the shadow radius for ordinary Schwarzschild black
hole by considering X= 0. Based on the EHT horizonscale image of SgrA∗, two constraints
have been proposed for shadow radius [132], as 4 .55< R sh<5.22 and 4 .21< R sh<5.56
considered as 1 σand 2 σ, respectively.
Therefore, we have examined these conditions to explore the limits on the Xvalue. For
better visualization the shadow radius versus Xis plotted for M= 1 and the experimental
constraints are shown by two pairs of horizontal lines in Fig. 7.

0< X < 0.037 at the 1 σconfidence level and extends to 0 < X < 0.86 at the 2 σconfidence
level.

variety of mass: M= 0.75,1.00,1.25,1.50.
Then, in Fig. 8, we display an analysis of the shadows of our black hole for a range
ofXvalues on the left side. Remarkably, the shadow radius demonstrates a noticeable
augmentation as the parameter Xincreases. On the right–hand side, we investigate the
influence of mass on the same Lorentz–violating parameter, namely, X= 0.5. As illustrated
in the figure, the shadow radius experiences a notable enlargement when the initial mass M
transitions from 0 .75 to 1 .50. In addition, since we are dealing with a real positive defined
values of radius, RShadow turns out to be bounded from above, i.e., having its maximum
value for X= 0.86.
VI. TIME DELAY AND DEFLECTION ANGLE
The investigation of time delay in Lorentz–violating scenarios holds a profound signif-
icance within the realm of theoretical physics. By delving into this exploration, we gain
profound insights into the fundamental aspects of spacetime and Lorentz symmetry break-
ing. In this regard, the determination of time delay can be accomplished by rewriting the
Lagrangian for null geodesics using Eq. (29) and Eq. (30). This mathematical approach
allows us to accurately quantify the temporal delay experienced by particles, shedding light
19on the intricate dynamics of spacetime as follows

Moreover, the deflection of light as it passes through curved spacetime serves as a tool
to analyze the physics of a source of gravitation [133–136]. The calculation of the deflection
angle can be carried out by applying the following equation [137]

Within the scope of our analysis, we employ the symbol ˆ αto represent the deflection
angle. Table. IV provides a systematic evaluation of the time delay and deflection angle for
a range of Xvalues. Our method involves initially determining the minimum radius along
the trajectory for each specific X.
To quantify the time delay, we establish a reference point using t0as the baseline for the
time delay, which corresponds to the original Schwarzschild black hole scenario with X= 0.
We then calculate the time delay ratio for each parameter within the bumblebee theory.
The deflection angles are similarly derived through the application of Eq. (39).
The results in Table. IV reveal that while the minimum radius diminishes with increas-
ingX, it is important to note that the time delay ratio, the actual time delay, and the
deflection angle demonstrate distinct behaviors. Specifically, an increase in the value of Xis
associated with longer time delays and larger deflection angles, underscoring the heightened
gravitational effect corresponding to higher values of X.

VII. CONCLUSION
This study delved into the intriguing realm of bumblebee gravity, employing the metric–
affine formalism to explore its various signatures. By investigating the effects of the Lorentz
violation parameter, X, we observed significant modifications in the renowned Hawking tem-
perature. Interestingly, as Xincreased, the values of the Hawking temperature experienced
a notable attenuation.
Our analysis extended to the examination of quasinormal modes through the utilization
of the WKB method. Notably, we found that a stronger Lorentz–violating parameter led to
a deceleration in the damping oscillations of gravitational waves, showcasing the intricate
interplay between bumblebee gravity and Lorentz violation. In addition, we calculated the
transmission and reflection coefficients in this context.
To better comprehend the implications of the quasinormal spectrum on time–dependent
scattering phenomena, we conducted a meticulous exploration of scalar perturbations in the
time–domain solution. This analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the impact
and behavior of scalar perturbations under varying conditions.
Furthermore, our investigation extended to the concept of shadows, where we discovered
a compelling relationship between the Lorentz violation parameter Xand shadow radii.
Specifically, larger values of Xwere found to correspond to increased shadow radii. More
so, they were bounded from above, i.e., X= 0.86. Lastly, our research delved into the realm
of time delay and deflection angle within this scenario, shedding light on additional aspects
of the intricate interplay between bumblebee gravity and its implications.
