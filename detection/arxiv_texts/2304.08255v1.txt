In the era of precision cosmology, diﬀerent observational d ata has led to precise measurements
of the Hubble constant that diﬀer signiﬁcantly, what has bee n called the Hubble tension problem.
In order to solve such a discrepancy, many diﬀerent solution s have been proposed, from systematic
errors on the observational data to theoretical proposals t hat assume an early dark energy that
might aﬀect the universe expansion at the time of recombinat ion. In this paper, a model of
varying cosmological constant is proposed in the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The
corresponding gravitational action is reconstructed and s uch a model is shown to reproduce well the
inﬂationary era together with dark energy epoch and at the sa me time to provide an explanation
for the discrepancy on the Hubble constant predictions. The transition to a phantom epoch is also
realised, avoiding the usual instability problems of ordin ary scalar ﬁeld models.

I. INTRODUCTION
As pointed out by diﬀerent sources of observations, there exists a conﬂict on the predicted Hubble constant value
from observational data. While the Planck collaboration through ob servations of the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) and the posterior data analysis shed a value of the Hubble con stant given by H0= 67.36±0.54 km/s/Mpc [1],
some other observations based on late-time sources provide a gre ater value. For instance, the Supernovae H0for the
EquationofState(SH0ES)collaborationestimates H0= 73.5±1.4km/s/Mpc[2]. Similarlyotherlow- zmeasurements,
as H0LiCOW returns a value of H0= 73.3+1.7
−1.8km/s/Mpc [3] while the Megamaser Cosmology Project predicts
H0= 73.9±3.0 km/s/Mpc [4–6]. Such discrepancy reaches a 4 σtension in some cases. This problem is the
so-called “Hubble Tension” problem [7]. While such tension might be a con sequence of systematic errors in the
measurements, the existing tension among diﬀerent sources of da ta would imply the same errors over all of them.
Hence, over the last few years, some other ways to solve such a pr oblem have been explored theoretically. One of
them is based on a hypothetical variation of the cosmological const ant along the universe expansion, such that the
value during recombination does not remain constant till the curren t epoch and consequently the analysis by the
Planck collaboration mislead such variation that would aﬀect the resu lting Hubble constant. This hypothesis can
be modelled in many diﬀerent ways but all of them have been referred to as “Early Dark Energy” [8–22]. In this
scenario, the cosmological constant is not constant but varies in t ime, such that it evolutes and changes its value
in the early universe. For early universe observations, the estimat ion of the Hubble constant is based on angular
scales and consequently on the ratio of the physical scale and the a ngular distance to the CMB, such that if they are
modiﬁed, a diﬀerent value of the Hubble constant is obtained. To ach ieve a varying cosmological constant, there have
been some attempts by using modiﬁed gravity theories like F(R) gravity as in [23] (for a general review on modiﬁed
gravity theories, see [24–28]).
As far as the early cosmological constant was smaller than the pres ent one, there might be a period during which
the Hubble rate Hincreases, ˙H >0. In Einstein’s gravity, for a ﬂat Friedmann-Lemaˆ ıtre-Robertso n-Walker (FLRW)

spacetime, the corresponding equations yield:

=p, (1)
whereρandpare the energy density and the pressure of matter respectively, such that the equation of state (EoS)
parameter is given by:
wtotal=p
ρ=−1−2˙H
3H2. (2)
Hence, as far as ˙H >0, the EoS parameter is wtotal≤ −1. Such types of ﬂuids are called phantom [29] and violate
the null energy condition. Therefore, an eﬀective phantom ﬂuid is n ecessary to solve the Hubble tension problem in
this way. Consequently, a natural scenario to realize such a mecha nism might be described by phantom dark energy,
which can mimic a varying cosmological constant. In the phantom dar k energy scenario, the energy density increases
as the expansion of the universe does, and the eﬀective cosmologic al constant increases with time too. In [30], such
a scenario is proposed where the coupling between the baryonic mat ter and the dark matter produces a phantom.
This transition can be also realized by using a scalar ﬁeld [31] but to hav e a stable phantom-crossing barrier, several
scalar ﬁelds are required [32, 33]. Furthermore, in a phantom univer se within simple scalar-tensor theory, the scalar
ﬁeld becomes a ghost, which induces instabilities at the quantum level.
In this paper, we focus on the reconstructionofa varyingcosmolo gicalconstant model within scalar-Einstein-Gauss-
Bonnetgravity(EGB), whereaphantomtransitionmight be achieve dwithout instabilities [34]. Otherscenarioswhere
a varying cosmological constant is proposed have been analysed in t he literature [35, 36]. In EGB gravity, the scalar
ﬁeldφis coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant, motivated by string y corrections [37, 38]. Within these models,
one might describe correctly the whole cosmological evolution by an e ﬀective varying cosmological constant whose
evolution reproduces the inﬂationary period in the very early univer se, and later the dark energy epoch in the present
universe, while its evolution also explains the diﬀerences in the measur ements of the Hubble constant among the early
and late-time observational data. EGB gravity has been analyzed p reviously in the literature, showing a successful
realization of inﬂation within these models [39–54]. In addition, black ho les have been also analysed in EGB gravities,
showingsome diﬀerentsolutionsin comparisonwith GR [55–61]Also, m odels that reproducethe late-time acceleration
have been considered in the framework of the Gauss-Bonnet grav ities [34, 38], which show that the models can be
compatible with observational data [62].
Here we focus on the realization of a varying cosmological constant within EGB gravity that might reproduce
inﬂation and late-time acceleration, and alleviate the Hubble tension.T o do so, we propose a particular model that
can be read as an eﬀective cosmological constant whose value is evo lving with the cosmological expansion, such that
during each diﬀerent epoch it falls into an eﬀective cosmological cons tant and then transits to the next stage. All this
mechanism is shown to be reproduced within EGB gravity, since it prov ides a simple way to recast the corresponding
cosmological behaviour and to obtain the gravitational action. We s how that Early Dark Energy can be described by
such model and also a phantom transition is achieved.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section II EGB gravity is introdu ced. Section III is devoted to the
reconstruction procedurefor obtaining a uniﬁed model. Inﬂation is analyzed in Section IV while Phantom dark energy
is studied in Section V. Finally, in Section VI we introduce a generalizatio n of EGB gravity and the corresponding
equations.
II. SCALAR-EINSTEIN-GAUSS-BONNET GRAVITY IN FLRW SPACETI ME
Let us start by introducing the gravitational action for the so-ca lled scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity:
S=/integraldisplay
d4x√−g/bracketleftbiggR
2κ2−1
2∂µφ∂µφ−V(φ)−ξ(φ)G/bracketrightbigg
, (3)
where the Gauss-Bonnet invariant Gis given by:
G ≡R2−4RµνRµν+RµνρσRµνρσ. (4)
Note that as far as one sets the coupling ξ(φ) to be constant, the Gauss-Bonnet term does not contribute to the ﬁeld
equations because Gis a topological invariant. The corresponding ﬁeld equations are obt ained by varying the action
(3) with respect to the metric and to the scalar ﬁeld, which leads to:
0 =/squareφ−V′(φ)−ξ′(φ)G. (5)3
This is the equation for the scalar ﬁeld φ, whereas the gravitational ﬁeld equations are:
Tµν=1
2κ2/parenleftbigg

∇2ξ(φ)/parenrightbig
Rµν+4gµν(∇ρ∇σξ(φ))Rρσ−4(∇ρ∇σξ(φ))Rµρνσ. (6)
HereTµνis the energy-momentum tensor for the matter ﬁelds. We should no te that the ﬁeld equations (6) remain
second order since no derivatives of curvature arise in the equatio ns due to the linearity of the action with respect to
the curvature and the Gauss-Bonnet term. Along this paper, we a re considering a ﬂat FLRW metric:
ds2=−dt2+a(t)2/summationdisplay
i=1,2,3/parenleftbig
dxi/parenrightbig2. (7)
Here the metric is expressed in comoving coordinates, where tis the cosmological time and a(t) is the scale factor.
Hence, the (00) and ( ij) components of the ﬁeld equations (6) turn out:

which can be easily solved in terms of the scale factor, leading to:
ρm=ρm0a−3(1+wm)=ρm0e−3(1+wm)N. (11)
Hereρm0is a constant and Nis the number of e-foldings a= eN. For convenience, the ﬁeld equations (8) can be
expressed in terms of Ninstead of the cosmic time tas the independent variable:

. (13)
In this paper, we intend to describe inﬂation, early dark energy, an d dark energy under the same model, such that it
might be seen as a standard ΛCDM model with a varying cosmological c onstant:
H(N)2=κ2

Λ(N)+/summationdisplay

. (14)4
By comparing ﬁrst equation in (12) with (14), we ﬁnd:
Λ(N) =1
2H2φ′2+V(φ)+24H4dξ(φ)
dφφ′. (15)
In addition, from the scalar ﬁeld equation (5), we can deﬁne an eﬀec tive potential Veﬀ(φ) forφgiven by:
Veﬀ(φ) =V(φ)+ξ(φ)G=V(φ)+24H3(H′+H)ξ(φ), (16)
Hence, the ﬁeld equation (5) for φin the FLRW spacetime (7) has the following form,
0 =¨φ+3H˙φ+dVeﬀ(φ)
dφ. (17)
By this equation (17), one can note that the dynamics of the scalar ﬁeldφis governed by the eﬀective potential
Veﬀ(φ). Then, if the scalar ﬁeld is on an extremum of Veﬀ(φ), it may stay there, where φ′=˙φ= 0. In such a case, the
varying cosmological constant becomes Λ( N) =V(φ) but is not given by Veﬀ(φ) despite the scalar ﬁeld might not be
on an extremum of V(φ). We should note that the eﬀective potential Veﬀ(φ) depends on the Hubble rate and its ﬁrst
derivative, or in other words, on the spacetime curvature. There fore the minimum of the eﬀective potential Veﬀ(φ)
changes according to the change in curvature and consequently, a phase transition might occur along the cosmological
evolution, in analogy to an eﬀective potential at a ﬁnite temperatur e, where a phase transition might occur depending
on the temperature.
III. RECONSTRUCTING A UNIFIED MODEL THAT INCLUDES EARLY DAR K ENERGY
In this section, ﬁrstly we introduce the reconstruction procedur e based on the one developed in Refs. [37] and [63],
and then, we propose a model that might realize inﬂation, early dark energy, and dark energy under the same
mechanism. The scalar potential can be dropped out by combining bo th equations in (12) leading to:
0 =2HH′

H(N2)/summationdisplay
m(1+wm)ρm0e−3(1+wm)N2/bracerightBigg
. (19)
HereN(1)andN(2)are integration constants. Furthermore, by using the ﬁrst equa tion in (12), the expression for the
scalar potential is ﬁnally achieved:
V(φ(N)) =3
κ2H(N)2−1

Hence, by assuming a model described by the following scalar potent ial and coupling in terms of two functions
g=g(N) andf=f(φ):
ξ(φ) =1

mρm0e−3(1+wm)f−1(φ).(22)
The corresponding solutions for the Hubble rate and the scalar ﬁeld are obtained:
H(N) =g(N), φ=f−1(N), (23)
wheref−1(N) is the inverse function of f(N). Note also that by using (14), the function g(N) can be expressed in
terms of the varying cosmological constant as follows:
g(N)2=κ2
3/parenleftBigg
Λ(N)+/summationdisplay
mρm0e−3(1+wm)N/parenrightBigg
. (24)
Then, the expressions for the scalar potential and coupling (21,22 ) can be rewritten as:

In addition, there is still a degree of freedom in the choice of f(φ), such that we may identify the scalar ﬁeld φwith
the number of e-foldings φ=N, which simpliﬁes the calculations. Another possible choice for f(N) might be such
that:
1
g(N)/braceleftBigg
Λ′(N)
3+g(N)2
f′(f−1(N))2/bracerightBigg
=2

By such a choice, the expressions in (25) and (26) turns out:
ξ(φ) =1

where we have suppressed an integration constant by assuming N(1)→+∞. Then, Eq. (27) can be rewritten as
follows:
dφ

which can be easily solved, leading to:
φ(N) =±/integraldisplayN

κ3g(N′)−Λ′(N′)
3g(N′)2. (30)
Hence, bysolving(30) with respectto N, wecanobtain N=f(φ) in (23). It isstraightforwardtoshowthe consistency
of all the procedures by using the equations (23), (25), and (26) to obtain the scalar potential:

dφ=−g(f(φ))g′(f(φ))
f′(φ)+g(f(φ))2f′′(φ)
f′(φ)3−3g(f(φ))2

which leads to:

f′(φ)3+g(f(φ))g′(f(φ))
f′(φ)+3g(f(φ))2
f′(φ). (33)
Hence, Eq. (31) is equivalent to the ﬁeld equation (17) for φin the FLRW spacetime described by the metric (7).
Let us consider the following example for a varying cosmological cons tant given by:
Λ(N) =Λlatee(N−NEDE)2n+1
e(N−NEDE)2n+1+√ΛinfΛlate+Λlate
ΛEDE−1+Λinfe−(N−NEDE)2n+1
e−(N−NEDE)2n+1+√ΛinfΛlate+Λinf
ΛEDE−1(34)
Herenis a non-negative integer, n= 0,1,2,3,···, and Λ inf, ΛEDE, and Λ lateare constants. We may assume that
late-time including the present time corresponds to a large N. When Nis large, Λ( N) goes to a constant Λ late,
which we may be identiﬁed with the eﬀective cosmological constant in t he present universe. The limit N→ −∞
correspondsto the early universe, when Λ( N) goes to another constant Λ inf, which may be identiﬁed with the eﬀective
cosmological constant that produces inﬂation. On the other hand , whenN∼NEDE, we ﬁnd Λ( N) behaves also as a
constant:
Λ(N)∼ΛEDE+O/parenleftBig
(N−NEDE)4n+2/parenrightBig
. (35)
Hence, Λ EDEwill be the eﬀective cosmological constant corresponding to the ea rly dark energy. In this scenario, the
value of the eﬀective cosmological constant in the early universe, a t the moment of recombination approximately,
was smaller than in the present universe. Therefore we ﬁnd a hierar chy 0<ΛEDE<Λlate<Λinf. By contrast,
in s single scalar ﬁeld model, such uniﬁcation might be impossible to be rea lized, since the early dark energy with
a single scalar ﬁeld Λ EDEshould correspond to a minimum of the potential of the scalar ﬁeld if Λ EDE, Λlate, and
Λinfcorrespond to the extrema of the potential. The minimum of the pot ential is stable and Λ( N) = ΛEDEcould
not evolute to Λ( N) = Λlate>ΛEDEbecause the scalar ﬁeld would require climbing the potential. Neverth eless, in
the case of scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, since Λ( N)/negationslash=Veﬀ(φ) but Λ(N) =V(φ), and the eﬀective potential
Veﬀ(φ) depends on the curvature, such a transition is possible.
IV. INFLATION
Let us now analyze the behavior of the model (34) during the inﬂatio nary epoch. For N→ −∞, Eq. (34) can be
expanded in a power series of eN−NEDEas follows:
Λ(N) =Λinf/bracketleftBigg

For simplicity here, we only consider the case that n= 0. Furthermore we have assumed Λ inf≫Λlate>ΛEDEand
consequentlyΛinf
ΛEDEeN−NEDE≪1. During inﬂation, any other matter contribution can be neglected , such that (24)

V. PHANTOM DARK ENERGY
In this section, we consider the possible scenario of phantom dark e nergy instead of a varying cosmological constant
considered above. Phantom dark energy is usually described by a pe rfect ﬂuid whose EoS parameter wphantom<−1,
such that the energy density of the phantom ﬂuid increases with th e expansion of the universe:
ρphantom=ρphantom0e−3(1+wphantom )N, (49)
where−3(1+wphantom)>0. Since the energy density increasesalong the expansion, the Hub ble parameter measured
todayH0might be larger than the Hubble rate at the time of recombination and consequently, the phantom scenario
might provide predictions consistent with the observations and par ticularly with the tension on the Hubble rate.
The reconstruction of a phantom ﬂuid is not possible in standard sca lar-tensor theory without any Gauss-Bonnet
terms, where the action for a canonical scalar ﬁeld is given by:
S=/integraldisplay
d4x√−g/bracketleftbiggR
2κ2−1
2∂µφ∂µφ−V(φ)/bracketrightbigg
. (50)
In a FLRW universe (7), the energy density ρφand the pressure pφfor the scalar ﬁeld φare given by:
ρφ=1
2˙φ2+V(φ), pφ=1
2˙φ2−V(φ). (51)
Hence, since the energy density is deﬁned as positive, the potentia l is non-negative V(φ)≥0, and consequently the
EoS parameter wφis always greater than −1,
wφ≡pφ
ρφ=−1+˙φ2
1
2˙φ2+V(φ)>−1, (52)
Nevertheless, one might construct a phantom dark energy model within the framework of scalar-tensor theory by
assuming a negative kinetic term,
S=/integraldisplay
d4x√−g/bracketleftbiggR
2κ2+1
2∂µφ∂µφ−V(φ)/bracketrightbigg
, (53)
whose energy density ρφand the pressure pφare given by
ρφ=−1
2˙φ2+V(φ), pφ=−1
2˙φ2−V(φ), (54)
which gives the following EoS parameter,
wφ≡pφ
ρφ=−1−˙φ2
−1
2˙φ2+V(φ), (55)
and therefore wφcan be smaller than −1. However,the model (53) is physicallyinconsistent because from the classical
point of view, the energy density ρφis unbounded from below, and from the quantum theory, the scalar ﬁeld becomes
a ghost, which generates negative norm states and therefore th e model contradicts the basic concept of quantum
mechanics.9
In [30], a scenario to reproduce phantom dark energy without the p resence of ghosts has been proposed by assuming
a coupling between baryonic matter and dark matter that shows a p hantom transition. Also in the framework of the
scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a phantom universe can be realized without ghosts [34]. Hence, here we are considering
the possibility of reproducing phantom dark energy within the scalar -Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (3). To do so,
since the eﬀective cosmological constant increases with time in the p hantom scenario, we may simply consider the
model for Λ( N) in Eq. (24) given by:
Λ(N) = Λ0eαN. (56)
Here Λ 0andαare positive constants. As Λ( N) increases with the number of e-foldings N, Eq. (56) provides the total
energy density asymptotically, such that the eﬀective EoS parame terwleads to:
w=−1−α
3. (57)
And a phantom universe occurs for α >0. Hence, for this model, the corresponding Hubble parameter (14 ) is given
by:
H(N)2=κ2
3/parenleftbig
Λ0eαN+ρ0e−3N/parenrightbig
. (58)
Here we have neglected every other contribution except a pressu relessﬂuid that accounts for dark matter and baryons.
By assuming N= 0 corresponding to the present time, ρ0is the sum of the energy densities of dark matter and
ordinary matter today and by assuming the value of the Hubble cons tant as provided by the Planck collaboration,
H0= 67.36±0.54 km/s/Mpc, one ﬁnds Λ 0+ρ0= 8.15×10−27kg m−3, and since dark energy represents 68.3% of
the total energy density, Λ 0= 5.56×10−27kg m−3. Nevertheless, the cosmological constant varies with time within
the model (56), such that at the epoch of recombination, which co rresponds to eNCMB∼1/1100, the corresponding
cosmological constant according to the Planck data is:
Λ0eαNCMB= 5.56×10−27kg m−3, (59)
where the number of e-foldings at the time of recombination is:
NCMB∼ −7.00. (60)
Ontheotherhand, low- zobservationsprovideavalueofthe Hubble rategreaterthantheo nefromPlanck, H0∼73-74
km/s/Mpc, which leads to Λ 0+ρ0= 9.70×10−27kg m−3and the present dark energy density is given by:
Λ0= 6.63×10−27kg m−3. (61)
By comparing (59) and (61), and using (60), one ﬁnds:
α= 0.0251. (62)
Then, we can check and compare with the observed value the time at which the transition from decelerating expansion
to accelerating expansion occurs, which corresponds to:
0 =¨a
a=˙H+H2=H′H+H2. (63)
By using (58), we obtain,
0 =/parenleftBig
1+α
2/parenrightBig
Λ0eαNtra−ρ0
2e−3Ntra. (64)
HereNtrais the number of e-foldings corresponding to the transition from decelerating expan sion to accelerating
expansion evaluated in terms of the present scale factor. By using (64), the corresponding value leads to:
Ntra=−0.49. (65)
Observations of Supernovae point that the transition occurred a t redshift z= 0.67, which in terms of the number of
e-foldings, N=−ln(1+z), givesNtra=−0.51, which is compatible with (65), as predicted by this model. This is
possible since αin (62) is small enough. Hence, the model (56) might be consistent w ith observations, providing at
the same time a cosmological constant that evolutes with the expan sion, such that its diﬀerent values at the present
epoch in comparison to the epoch of recombination may shed some ligh t on the tension of the Hubble constant as
provided by early and late observational data.10
VI. SOME GENERALIZATIONS OF EGB GRAVITY
LetusnowconsiderageneralizationoftheactionforEGBgravity. T hesimplestwayofgeneralizingthegravitational
action (3) is to promote the Ricci scalar term to an arbitrary funct ion coupled to the scalar ﬁeld [62]:

, (66)
whereη(R.φ) is a function of the scalar curvature Rand the scalar ﬁeld φ. In comparisonto EGB gravityas described
by the action (3), this type of model includes ghost modes in genera l, such that the model might not be considered
a consistent eﬀective theory. Nevertheless, by considering the p articular case where η(R,φ) =ζ(φ)R, i.e., a Brans-
Dicke-like model, ghost instabilities might be avoided. The ﬁeld equation s are obtained by varying the action (66)
with respect to the scalar ﬁeld φand the metric gµν, which lead to:

the solution is given by (23). Note that now there is an extra ingredie nt in the model, given by the coupling to the
Ricci scalar ζ(φ), which remains arbitrary, such that might be chosen to simplify the equations. Let us consider the11
case given by [62]:
ζ(φ) =φ0
φ, V(φ) =V0φ0
φ,˙ξ=Ca, (73)
whereφ0,V0, andCare constants. Such a model is to be compatible with observations [ 62]. Then, we might consider
the Hubble parameter given in (24) and (34). By following the same pr ocedure as in the previous section the value of
ΛEDEcan be set as:
ΛEDE= 5.56×10−27kg m−3. (74)
By assuming N0to be the number of e-foldings at the present time, Eq. (60) provides eN0−NEDE∼1,100≫1 while
the expression for the varying cosmological constant (34) impose s:
Λ(N0)∼Λlate. (75)
We might compare (75) with (61), such that:
Λlate= 6.63×10−27kg m−3. (76)
Hence, the gravitational action (66) with (24) and (34) also uniﬁes the cosmological evolution under the same
mechanism, that is a varying cosmological constant produced by th e evolution of a scalar ﬁeld non-minimally coupled.
VII. CONCLUSION
In summary, we have reconstructed a model that might explain the inﬂationary paradigm during the very early
universe, the accelerating expansion of the present universe, an d the early dark energy in a uniﬁed way by using the
reconstructing the corresponding gravitational action in the fra mework of scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The
model reproduces inﬂation successfully and describes realistic dar k energy simultaneously. In addition, the model
may solve the Hubble tension problem by inducing an early dark energy without breaking the reasonable properties of
inﬂation and the present dark energy epochs. All rely on an eﬀectiv e varying constant that is produced by the eﬀects
of a scalar ﬁeld coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant in the action. Such cosmological constant may reconcile the
values provided by the Planck collaboration and the one obtained fro m low-redshifts observations as Sne Ia/Cepheids,
sincethe cosmologicalconstantgrowswith theexpansion, suchth atboth datasetsmightprovidecorrectmeasurements
of the Hubble constant, the failure lies on considering the ΛCDM mode l as the ﬁducial model, as performed with the
data from the CMB, where the Hubble constant is estimated by using the luminosity distance and the positions and
heights of the CMB power spectrum peaks based on the ΛCDM model.
The Hubble constant given by Λ EDEin (34), for example, might be diﬀerent from one estimated by Planck
collaboration, since it diﬀers from the current one, as it evolves with the expansion, transiting from one stage to the
next. Inaddition, wehaveshownthatinﬂationcanbewellrealisedint hisframework,wherethecorrespondingspectral
index and tensor-to-scalarratio can ﬁt well the values provided by CMB observations by setting the appropriate value
ofasingleparameter. Moreover,themodelshowsthataphantom transitionmightoccurwithouttheusualinstabilities
of standard scalar ﬁelds.
However, one might point that in our formalism the presence of extr a degrees of freedom allows the reconstruction
of any expansion of the universe which can be modiﬁed appropriately to ﬁt the observational data. Nevertheless, the
model tries to unify diﬀerent behaviours of the cosmological expan sion along the whole cosmological history, such
that whether one compares this uniﬁed perspective from the usua l models for inﬂation and (early) dark energy, there
are not actually extra degrees of freedom.
Moreover,this analysisshould workout as an excellent starting poin t to gofurther in the analysisof scalar-Einstein-
Gauss-Bonnet gravity, since it provides a correct description of t he universe expansion, sheds some light about the
possible solution to the Hubble tension problem and at the same time is a bsent of ghosts. Further analysis focused
on other gravitational aspects should show the deﬁnite test for t his type of theories.
Hence, in this paper we have proposed a way to construct solutions within the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnetgravity
and showed that a uniﬁed description of the whole cosmological histo ry can be achieved, including a possible solution
to the Hubble tension problem.12
