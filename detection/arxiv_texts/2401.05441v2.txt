ABSTRACT  
This paper  describes an architecture for predicting the price of cryptocurrencies for the  next seven days 
using the Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS ). Historical data of cryptocurrencies 
and indexes that are considered are Bitcoin  (BTC) , Ethereum  (ETH) , Bitcoin Dominance  (BTC.D) , and 
Ethereum  Dominance  (ETH.D)  in a  daily timeframe. The methods used to teach the data are hybrid and

1. INTRODUCTION  
Digital currency is a form of electronic money that operates on the internet and possesses most 
of the attributes of conventional money, except for its physical absence. A subset of digital 
currency is cryptocurrency, which is encrypted by specific algorithms. These cryptocurrencies 
often utilize blockchain technology  to record transactions  [1]. The main distinction between 
cryptocurrencies and other digital currencies is the level of security of the former. Some 
examples of digital currencies are Web Money and Perfect Money, and some examples of 
cryptocurrencies are BTC and ETH.   
A trade or transaction is one of the main economic concepts that includes the purchase and sale 
of goods and services by paying a fee from the buyer to the seller or the exchange of goods or 
services between the parties to the transaction. The network that facilitates trading is called the 
market. In financial markets, trading refers to the buying and selling of securities, such as 
buying stocks from a stock exchange or buying and selling cryptocurrencies. In trading, the 
general goal is to make a profit by  buying at a lower price and selling at a higher price, usually 
in a short period.  
Technical analysis (TA) is a key technique for financial market analysis, enabling optimal 
transaction timing. However, TA proficiency alone is insufficient for market success; time 
commitment and market vigilance are also required. Additionally, human decision -making 
differs from algorithmic processes, as it is influenced by biological and psychological factors 
(e.g., fatigue, fear, greed), which may impair its effectiveness.   Cryptocurrencies are subject to severe price fluctuations in the financial market because they are 
independent of any governmental organization . These fluctuations create opportunities for large 
profits but also expose traders to high risks [1]. Hence, automated systems are required in the 
financial market. The existing automated systems for the Forex market are inadequate for this 
market, so a market -specific automated system is necessary. According to  a research, automated 
trading systems dominate most of the current trades [2].  
These systems enable traders to define rules for capital entry and exit that can be automatically 
executed by computer. These systems are order execution methods that use automated trading 
instructions and pre -programmed algorithms to compute variables such as price, time, and 
volume.  Algorithmic trading to perform the specified strategy correctly and completely perform 
tasks that are sometimes performed entirely automatically by robots (trading robots) that include 
"fully automated" transactions [4], [5] and sometim es in some areas of taste. And human 
opinion is involved, in which case transactions are referred to as "semi -automated" [6], [7]. 
semi -automated algorithms are classified into several categories: Trading Algorithms, Signaling 
Algorithms, Monitoring Algorithms, Position Trading Algorithms,  and Frequency Algorithms. 
In contrast , the disadvantages of these systems can be low coding accuracy, mechanical  defects, 
monitoring,  and over-optimization.  
Signaling algorithms enhance market analysis and decision -making, boosting traders’ profits. 
They can signal price or trend forecasts. Price forecasts are short -term profitable  [8], but trend 
forecasts are long -term effective. Price forecasting systems use machine learning on time -series 
data [9], while trend forecasting systems use technical analysis indices . Price forecasting can 
improve trading outcomes, but price prediction is challenging  [2]. 
 
2. RELATED WORK 
Signaling algorithms provide the analyst w ith more information about market conditions and 
help the analyst to improve the flow of analysis and decision -making and consequently trades, 
which results in increased profitability of the trader or analyst. These algorithms can signal both 
price prediction and price trend prediction.  
Price prediction is one of the most important issues in financial and commercial markets, we 
can decide to buy or sell knowing the future price, so extensive research  has been done in this 
area. Price data in financial marke ts are of the type  of time series data , time series is a set of data 
that occurred in a period, respectively. Machine learning techniques can be used to predict time 
series data . Time series forecasting methods use historical and statistical information to forecast, 
so these methods can also be used to predict prices.  
Because price prediction is a difficult nonlinear problem, neural networks  (NN)  can be used 
to solve this problem.   Reference [10] uses an artifi cial neural network (ANN) to predict stock 
prices in the H ong Kong Stock Exchange.  The innovation of this article is in data preprocessing, 
the steps of this preprocessing are in the form of clearing incomplete data, and normalizing the 
data using Max -Min and Z -Score methods, Finally, the results indicate that the normalization of 
data using the Max -Min method in the interval 
 compared to other intervals and the Z 
method -Score lowers the  Root Mean Square Error  (RMSE ) benchmark.  A fully automate d 
network trading system as a pipeline is designed  for the  Forex market  in [5]. In this pipeline, a 
regression network  with Scaled Conjugate Gradient  (SCG ) algorithm  is used to predict the price 
in the initial block, then the forecasted and is given to the next blocks to determine the price trend 
and decide . In this report, the system has improved the Maximum Drawdown (MDD ) and Return 
on Investme nt (ROI) benchmark compared to a system that used the Ichimok u Index with a 
resistance and support line to find the right position for entry and exit.  
As mentioned, machine learning techniques can predict time series and price . In [6] BTC  
information is coll ected in daily timeframes and then with machine learning a lgorithms  such as Linear Regression (LR), Logical Regression (LGR), Multivariate Regression (MR), Multiple 
Linear Regression (MLR), Least Squares Partial (PLS), Postpartum Error Neural Network 
(BPNN), KNN and DT and SVM and Regression Support Vector (SVR), Gradient Boosting 
Machine (GBM), Lasso Regression (LASSO) , price is forecast for BTC , finally price predicted 
for BTC  by LASSO algorithm has the best performance in terms of  RMSE and MAE criteria.  In 
[7] BTC , ETH , and Ripple trading data are preprocessed to remove noise data and then 
normalized for easier processing i n the range of   
   The data were then analyzed u sing several 
data mining methods including Decision Tree (DT) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) and NN, The results show that the SVM  had the best and the DT the 
worst performance in price forecasting in terms of MAE and RMSE criteria.  
BTC , Ripple , and ETH  trading data are collected in [1]. A comparison of this collection shows 
that the price increase of BTC  has been positive on the price increase of Ripple and ETH , then it 
uses two nonlinear algorithms, DT and KNN to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. The results 
of the experiments show that the k -closest neighborhood model performs better in terms of MAE 
and MSE criteria in th e low set space than the predictive DT model.  
An Adaptive  Neuro -Fuzzy Inference System or Adaptive Network -Based Fuzzy Inference 
System (ANFIS) is a kind of artificial neural network that is based on  the Takagi –Sugeno fuzzy 
inference system. it integrates both neural networks and fuzzy logic principles, its inference 
system corresponds to a set of fuzzy IF -THEN rules that have the learning capability to 
approximate nonlinear functions. Because price prediction is a difficult nonlinear problem,  we 
can use it  to price prediction. For prediction using ANFIS,  In [11] the data are given to a group of 
compatible ANFIS and then the output of each of these systems is combined using the average 
and weighted averages.  
The main idea of this method is that each ANFIS system uses a different method for training 
and membership performance. In this method, the Mackey -Glass time series is predicted with 
98% accuracy.  It is designed in [12] systems for forecasting stock market prices called PATSOS . 
This system uses two consecutive ANFIS systems, the first of which is called ANFIS Controller  
(CON -ANFIS ) and the second is ANFIS Process  (PR-ANFIS)  and it has feedback to the 
controller.  Finally, according to the results, this system has a higher value in terms of ROR than 
the buy and hold (B&H) strategy.  Reference  [13] uses the system designed in [12] to predict the 
price of cryptocur rencies  using various types of  membership  function s Finally, the results show 
that the RMSE criterion for PATSOS system is lower than ANFIS and ANN.  
The d eep learning method refers to powerful machine learning algorithms that specialize in 
solving nonlinear and complex problems by utilizing large amounts of data to become efficient 
predictive models. Since price prediction is a nonlinear problem, a deep learning method can be 
used to solve this problem. In [2], BTC , ETH , and Ripple cryptocurrencies were first obtained 
from the Kraken cryptocurrency market and then using a comb ination of three models of deep 
learning, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory 
Networks (BiLSTM) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) offers its own advanced deep 
learning models called CNN -LSTM and CNN -BiLSTM, then predicts the price using the said 
deep learning models and designed models and machine learning models SVR, KNN and DTR 
and compares their results by the evaluation criteria of MAE, RMSE, ACC , and F1 -Score.  
 In summary, the advanced deep learning models perform slightly better than the machine 
learning models, while the combined deep learning models perform better than the other two 
models, but this performance is not significantly different and there is not much change in 
performance , So the id ea arises that it is likely that the cryptocurrency price is a random walk or 
very close to it, so deep learning does not help much in learning price patterns.  
 
  3. METHODOL OGY 
 
As mentioned, it is impossible to avoid financial markets today with the advancement of 
technology, finding suitable entry and exit points will increase profits and reduce trading losses 
in these markets, so the decision here is more important. It was also said that today most of these 
are automated systems that are trading in the financial markets.  In addition to the payment 
method, cryptocurrenc ies are a good way to invest, but due to their nature, systems designed in 
other markets are not  applicable to t hem, so designing an automated system suitable for this 
market is important.  As we have se en, because price data are a type of time series data, they can 
be predicted using machine learning methods.in this paper , we present a system for predicting the 
price of cryptocurrencies using the ANFIS system.  The block diagram of this system is shown in 
Fig. 1.

A.  Adaptive Neuro -Fuzzy Inference System  
 
Adaptive  Neuro -Fuzzy Inference System or Adaptive Network -Based Fuzzy Inference 
System  is an adaptive fuzzy inference system that is a feedforward neural network with training 
capabilities  [11].  This system combines neural networks with the principles of fuzzy logic, so it 
has the advantages  of both, its inference system corresponds to a set of ambiguous IF -THEN 
rules that have the ability to learn the approximation of nonlinear functions  [12], [14]. 
 
1)   Structure of ANFIS  
The ANFIS structure consists of 5 layers. In the following, we describe the structure of the 
Sugeno -type ANFIS system with two inputs x, y, and one output f [14]. If the rules are as 
follows : 
 
     
  
 
The layers of the ANFIS  system are as follows : 
 
 Layer 1:  The first layer of an ANFIS network describes the difference from  vanilla NN. 
The first layer of which receives input data and at the end determines the membership 
functions, which is called “Fuzzification ”. The membership degrees of each function are 
computed by using the premise parameter set, namely 
 . 
 
  
 
 Layer 2:  The output of the second layer is the multiplication of its inputs,   which sho ws 
the power of each rule. It is equivalen t to the “if” part of the rules, which is called the “rule 
layer ”. 
 
                 
  
  
 Layer 3:  This layer normalizes the output of the second layer, which is called  the 
“normalization (N) layer ”. 
           
         
  
  
 Layer 4:  This layer defuzzifying the values given by the third layer . which is called 
“Defuzzification ”. and 
  are a set of consequent parameters.  
 
                 
  
               
 
 Layer 5 : This layer sums the input signals and pr oduces the final output of the ANFIS 
system . 
 
                  
  
 
 
2)  Data clustering  in ANFIS  
In ANFIS, data can be clustered in various ways such as grid partition, subtractive 
clustering , and FCM . FCM  is a type of clustering in which each point does not necessarily 
belong to just one cluster while the points in this method, using the membership score between 
[0,1] fuzzy belong to a different cluster . 
 
3)  ANFIS system training methods  
ANFIS modifies and adjusts learnable parameters to minimize the error between the 
system’s actual output and the desired output. One method, the Hybrid algorithm, uses two 
passes to reduce error. The forward pass sets the consequent parameters using LSE, and the 
backward pass changes the premise parameters using GD. Another method for tuning the 
ANFIS system parameters is the Back -propagation algorithm, which uses GD to adjust all 
parameters.  [15].  
 B.  Dominance  
Dominance in the term means domination. The dominance index is a general index that shows 
your unique share based on the position and weight of the asset relative to the entire 
crypto currency  market. The BTC  Dominance  (BTC.D)  Index is provided by CoinMarketCap1 
and measures the total market value of BTC  relative to the total market value of crypto currency  
assets. The ma rket value of BTC  is an important index  of investor s entime nt. Th erefore, using 
this index to predict the price of cryptocurrencies can be appropriate . 
 
C.  The proposed model  
While predictive analytics such as employing SVD within convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs) have a stronghold in modeling, particularly evid ent in medical science [17] , [18] , this 
paper takes a unique stance by forecasting cryptocurrency values using the adaptive network -
based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). It introduces a novel approach to predictive analys is 
within this specific domain.  The convergence of advanced language models in data analysis 
echoes the complexities encountered in forecasting crypto currency values. This integration 
highlights the essential depth of algorithms across diverse data domains, emphasizing the 
necessity for sop histicated methodologies in handling intricate predictive analytics  [19], [20] . 
This paper aims to forecast the cryptocurrency price for the next week, using the method 
illustrated in the block diagram in Fig. 2, which consists of several simple subsystems. Each 
subsystem receives the input value and the actual target value and trains the ANFIS system to 
predict the output in (k+1) based on the input in (k). Since each cryptocurrency may depend on 
or be affected by the price trends of other cryptocurrencies or indices such as BTC.D, we also 
need to forecast this signal simultaneously. Therefore, we include subsystems with multiple 
inputs in this system. We repeat this process for seven cycles by feeding the predicted price 
back to the subsystems as input, until we obtain the final output as the price prediction for the 
seventh day.  
 
4. EVALUATION  
 
A. Data set  
This paper analyzes the historical data of BTC and ETH and BTC.D and ETH.D at the end of 
a daily candle. This historical data has been collected from August 17, 2017 , to June 3, 2022 , 
from Tradingview2. Education and validation d ata are divided into two categories, data can be 
divided in  different ways: 50:50, 60:4 0, 70:30, 80:2 0, and 90:10. In this study, we consider 90% 
of the data for training and 10% for testing. Based on data sharing, the models are trained using a 
training set , and their ability to predict with the test set is evaluated.  
 
B. Check the parameters  
In this paper, our goal is to use the ANFIS system to forecast the price of BTC and ETH for 
the following week. We first predict the price of BTC and ETH in the daily time frame at (k+1) 
by using various parameters, training and clustering methods, and dependencies such as BTC.D 
and ETH.D. Then, based on Table 1, we keep some parameters of the ANFIS system constant 
and vary others, such as the clustering method and the training method, to find the optimal 
method.  
 
1 CoinMarketCap is the world's most trusted and accurate source for crypto currenc y market capitalizations, pricing , and 
information. CoinMarketCap  is a U.S. company registered in the United States of America.  
2 Trading view is an online trading and charting platform that also acts as a social network. It is an advanced financial visualization 
platform  As we can see in Table 2 , in predicting the price of BTC , when we use only the price of BTC  
itself to predict its price, according to the RMSE and Root Mean Square Relati ve Error  
(RMSRE ) criteria, the Backpropagation and FCM meth ods have the best performance  in test 
data. As we said, the value of BTC.D can affect the emotions of traders and the price of BTC , so 
once again we get the price of BTC  using two inputs, the price of BTC  and the amount of 
BTC.D . As we can see in Table 2 , in general, the use of BTC. D has a positive effect on 
predicting the price of BTC  and has improved the RMSE and RMSRE evaluation benchmarks.  
In Fig. 3  (a), we can see the difference between the act ual value and the predicted amount of 
BTC  in the case where  we us e BTC  and BTC.D  for prediction, in the testing  data, and in Fig. 3  
(b), We can see the amount of prediction error, that is, the difference between the actual price 
and the price predicted by the ANFIS system . 
Our aim is to forecast the price of ETH. We first use its price to predict ETH, and then we 
also include ETH.D and apply the parameters of Table 1 and the optimal methods of Table 2 for 
prediction. Table 3 shows that the evaluation criteria improve when we add ETH.D to the price 
of ETH for forecasting. We contrast the ANN method with the ANFIS system in Table 4. In this 
comparison, our ANN has 10 neurons and uses the Levenberg -Marquardt algorithm for data 
training, and our ANFIS method uses the fixed parameters of  Table 1 and the best -performing 
parameters in Table 2 for evaluation criteria (FCM method for data clustering and 
Backpropagation for data training). Both systems use BTC, BTC, and BTC.D as input for 
predicting BTC, and ETH, ETH, and ETH.D as input for predicting ETH. They also use 90% of 
the data for training and 10% for testing. The ANFIS system outperforms the ANN method in 
terms of RMSE criteria for BTC prediction in both training and testing data, but the ANN 
method does better in ETH prediction in te sting data.  
 
C. Predication for the next seven days  
Our aim is to forecast the price of BTC for the following week using the block diagram in Fig. 
2. We have seen that BTC.D improves the system evaluation criteria, so we use the block 
diagram in Fig. 2 with two subsystems, each predicting a signal. The first system predicts the 
price of BTC based on the two inputs, BTC and BTC.D and the second system predicts the 
value of BTC.D. We feed the predicted value from each subsystem back to the inputs for the 
next cycle. We repeat this for seven cycles to forecast the nex t week. In Fig. 4 (a), we observe  
the forecasted values for the price of Bitcoin for the next week for test data, with the predicted 
price diverging from the actual price each day. We also do this process to forecast the price of 
ETH for the next week. We have seen that ETH.D improves the evaluation criteria, so we use 
two subsystems for ETH, one predicting ETH.D and the other predicting ETH. In Fig. 4 (b), we 
see that the forecasted price for ETH differs from the actual price each cycle, with some error.  
 
 
D.  Statistical performance measures  
There are several criteria for evaluating the performance of price forecasting systems. In price 
forecasting systems , due to the importance of correctly identifying the predicted price, the focus 
is more on the differen ce between the actual price and the predicted price and the  amoun t of 
error. They conclude that we will describe two criteria in the following  [6]. 
 
1) Root Mean Square Error : The normalized distance between the predicted  (zi) and actual  
(di) values . 
        
   
 
2) Root Mean Square Relative Error: In fact, each error value obtai ned from the difference 
between the actual value and the pr edicted value is measured relative to the actual value  
[16].

5. CONCLUSION  
 
This study shows that historical price data is a kind of time series data, so we can use time series 
methods to forecast prices. We use the ANFIS system, a time series method, to forecast the 
prices of cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH in a daily timeframe for the following week. We 
first need to tune and assess the parameters of the ANFIS system to see which ones enhance the 
evaluation criteria for price forecasting. We split the BTC historical data into 90% training data 
and 10% test data and feed it to t he ANFIS system. Based on Table 2, we see that the ANFIS 
system improves the evaluation criteria such as RMSE and RMSRE by using the FCM 
algorithm for data clustering and the backpropagation algorithm for data training. We also need 
to see if an indicator like BTC.D improves system performance. We test the system with two 
inputs, the price of BTC and the value of BTC.D, and based on Table 2, the evaluation criteria 
improve compared to using only our BTC historical data for forecasting. We do the same for 
ETH, and based on Table 3, the evaluation criteria improve when we use ETH.D along with the price of ETH. In Table 4, we contrast this method with the ANN method and see that the 
ANFIS method performs better in terms of RMSE for BTC prediction in both training and test 
data, but the ANN method does better for ETH prediction in test data. Finally, we use the 
ANFIS system, as shown in the block diagram in Fig. 2, to forecast the price for the next week. 
We use a system with several subsystems to train and learn  all the dependencies such as the 
BTC.D index. This system forecasts the price in seven cycles for up to seven days, and the 
forecasted price in each cycle is input to the ANFIS system. The ANFIS system can forecast the 
price of the next day based on this price. Finally, based on Fig. 4, the forecasted price differs 
slightly from the actual price in each cycle.
