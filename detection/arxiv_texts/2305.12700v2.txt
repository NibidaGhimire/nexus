Continued advances in quantum technologies rely on producing nanometer-scale wires. Although
several state-of-the-art nanolithographic technologies and bottom-up synthesis processes have been
used to engineer such wires, critical challenges remain in growing uniform atomic-scale crystalline
wires and constructing their network structures. Here we discover a simple method to fabricate
atomic-scale wires with various arrangements, including stripes, X-, Y-junctions, and nanorings.
Single-crystalline atomic-scale wires of a Mott insulator, whose band gap is comparable to those of
wide-gap semiconductors, are spontaneously grown on graphite substrates by pulsed-laser deposition.
These wires are one-unit-cell-thick and have an exact width of two- and four-unit-cells (1.4 and
2.8 nm) and lengths up to a few µm. We show that the non-equilibrium reaction-diffusion processes
may play an essential role in atomic pattern formation. Our findings offer a new perspective on
the non-equilibrium self-organization phenomena on an atomic scale, paving a unique way for the
quantum architecture of nano-network.
INTRODUCTION
The fundamentals of device technology dramatically
change by the reduction of the dimensions. As the de-
vice size is reduced to the nanometer scale, the fab-
rication and integration of one-dimensional (1D) wire
patterns become increasingly complicated and demand-
ing. For the top-down approaches by using modern tech-
nologies with large-scale equipment, such as electron-
beam and focused ion-beam lithography (1–3), fabricat-
ing patterns of nanowires with thickness and width less
than∼10 nm is technically challenging. On the other
hand, bottom-up technologies by using self-assembly pro-
cesses (4–6) suffer from controlling the uniformity of the
wires. Moreover, in the bottom-up methods, the integra-
tion of nanowire arrays consists of two complicated steps:
growing randomly-oriented nanowires and aligning them
into an array. Most of the recent growth of nanowires is
based on the vapor-liquid-solid method (7–9). The as-
sembly of the nanowires harnesses various processes such
as Langmuir-Blodgett assembly (10, 11). Therefore, the
situation may call for a novel technology based on a fun-

atomic-scale wires and engineer their nano-patterns.
Apart from the semiconductor technologies, atomic
quantum wires of electron systems open a new route to
realizing exotic phases of matter. For example, it has
been proposed that in the proximity of a supercondcu-
tor, atomic quantum wires can host Majorana fermions,
which can provide an approach to constructing a fault-
tolerant quantum computer (12). Also, the quantum
wires consisting of correlated electrons provide a plat-
form for the physics of 1D non-Fermi liquid described by
such as Tomonaga-Luttinger model, in which spin-charge
separation plays an important role (13). Furthermore,
when the electron correlations are strong enough in the
half filled band, Mott insulators that can be seen as 1D
quantum magnets are realized. An exotic example of
such a system is an Ising magnet forming a tri-junction
(Y-junction), which has an exactly solvable ground state
hosting Majorana fermions (14). Therefore, the fabrica-
tion of quantum wire arrays and junctions in correlated
systems has the potential to significantly impact the field
of condensed matter physics.
Here we demonstrate that uniform and long single-
crystalline wires of β-RuCl 3in an atomic scale are reli-
ably fabricated by a simple deposition technique. Fur-
thermore, we manufactured several characteristic pat-
terns pivotal for realizing quantum nano-circuits, includ-arXiv:2305.12700v2  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  23 May 20232

ing atomically-smooth junctions and nanorings. β-RuCl 3
is an interesting material because it is a Mott insula-
tor in which electron-electron interaction opens a gap,
while at the same time its band gap is comparable to
those of wide-gap semiconductors. The formation of
these nanowire pattern takes place as a part of the thin
film growth, but the growth process is essentially differ-
ent from the conventional ones. In the present process,
the formation and integration of nanowires are achieved
simultaneously, making this method unique and attrac-
tive for applications. Furthermore, we obtain multi-
ple pieces of evidence that the observed atomic-scale
wire patterns emerge as a result of a characteristic self-
organization process. We will discuss that the non-
equilibrium reaction-diffusion processes may play an im-
portant role for the uniformly aligned patterns. We willfurther point out a possible atomic-scale Turing mecha-
nism (15), which has been discussed for macroscopic pat-
tern formations in chemistry (16) and biology (17–19).
RESULTS
We evaporated high-quality RuCl 3on the surfaces
of a highly-oriented-pyrolytic-graphite (HOPG) by the
pulse-laser-deposition (PLD) method (see Methods).
Figures 1A-E show the scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) topographic images of the growth results. Shown
in Fig. 1A is an atomic-resolution image of a sample
grown at the deposition temperatures of 400◦C. We
find that the surface is covered by a unique pattern of
wires (bright lines), which are ordered and almost evenly3

spaced. Each wire consists of periodically spaced atoms,
demonstrating the single-crystalline structure. Figure 1B
displays a typical large-scale picture of the growth, re-
vealing that the wires grow in some preferred directions
with being connected smoothly at the corners. The
direction is parallel to the zigzag-direction of the car-
bon honeycomb lattice of the substrate (orange arrow in
Fig. S1B). Reflecting the crystal structure of HOPG, the
growth direction of wires is oriented 60◦away from each
other. The regions between the atomic wires (dark blue
areas in Figs. 1A and 1B) are filled with a thin material.
Since no periodic lattice structure is seen (Fig. S1A), the
thin material is in an amorphous form consisting of Ru
and Cl, denoting as a-Ru-Cl.
To identify the material forming the atomic-scale
wires, we extend the deposition time to grow 2D mono-
layer and thicker films. As shown by the STM image
in Fig. 1E, we can obtain single-crystalline 2D monolayer
films. No wires are formed on the monolayer film, en-
abling continuous layer-by-layer growth (20). Based on
the combination of the characteristic zigzag chains and
X-ray diffraction pattern of the thicker films (Fig. S4),
we identify the crystal as β-RuCl 3. The zigzag chains
originate from the topmost Cl atoms as highlighted by
the red lines in Fig. 1F. The periodicity along the chain
corresponds to the lattice constant of β-RuCl 3, furthercorroborating that the chain is β-RuCl 3. The atomic
wires shown in Fig. 1A have the same periodicity as the
β-RuCl 3chain along the wire direction, and their widths
coincide with double (Fig. 1C) and quadruple (Fig. 1D)
β-RuCl 3chains. The same zigzag structure is resolved
only in the inner chains of four-unit-cell-width wires. The
apparent difference between the inner and outer chains
may be caused by scanning an edge (the outer chain in
this case) using a tip with finite curvature or may reflect
the difference in the electronic states of the inner and
outer chains. As discussed later ( Fig. 6F), the height of
the wire is ∼0.5 nm, which is consistent with the mono-
layer thickness of β-RuCl 3. The height of a-Ru-Cl is
typically less than 0 .2 nm, much smaller than β-RuCl 3.
A salient feature of the wire is its length. As demon-
strated in Fig. 2, the length is as long as more than 3 µm
(a length-width ratio is more than 1000), and both the
width and height of the wire are quite uniform over its en-
tire length. This length is significantly longer than most
of the nanowires with a few atomic widths reported so
far, which are typically 10–100 nanometer lengths. To
our knowledge, the presently observed patterns of uni-
form 1D atomic wires with mesoscipic length scale are
unique and unprecedented.
Based on the above results, we conclude that the
atomic wires consist of two or four β-RuCl 3single-4

crystalline chains growing in the [001]-direction directly
on the HOPG surfaces. Importantly, at the deposi-
tion temperature of 400◦C, the wires always consist of
quadruple chains of β-RuCl 3(Fig. 1D) while the width
is reduced to double chains at the lower deposition tem-
perature of 380◦C (Fig. 1C). Hereafter, we denote the
mechanism by which four (two) chains bundle together to
form a single wire “four- (two-) chain rule.” The detailed
mechanism of the four (two)-chain rule is not apparent,
and exploring its quantum-mechanical origin deserves fu-
ture studies. However, this rule is crucial for building a
model, as discussed later. We note that the c-axis lattice
constant of β-RuCl 3does not match the lattice constants
and their integer multiple of the carbon honeycomb lat-
tice. Therefore, the epitaxial coupling with HOPG is not
essential for the 1D wire formation, further supported by
the curved 1D wires shown in Figs. 3A and 6A.
As shown in Figs. 3A–D, the spacing between the 1D
wires is widely tunable ranging from lengths longer than
10 nm (Fig. 3A) to less than 2 nm (Fig. 3D), by chang-
ing the deposition time. The longer deposition time re-
sults in the formation of the 2D monolayer β-RuCl 3thin
film (Fig. 3E). A more quantitative analysis using the fast
Fourier transform is shown in Fig. 3F. The periodicity of
the wire, the inverse of the wavenumber at the peak posi-
tion in Fig. 3F, monotonically decreases as increasing the
deposition time (Fig. 3G). For the 5-shot, the periodic-
ity is 3 .5 nm, which is merely above the width of wires
(∼2.8 nm), indicating that the wire separation is less than1 nm.
Another few intriguing patterns found in addition to
the stripe patterns are X-, Y-junctions as well as nano-
rings composed of atomic-scale wires, as indicated in
Fig. 4. The height of the nano-ring and Y-junction is uni-
formly one-unit-cell. These results demonstrate the fab-
rication of atomically smooth junctions and rings with-
out introducing defects and clusters, which are crucially
important for nanocircuits.
To reveal the electronic structures, we measured
the differential tunneling conductance (d I/dV) spectra
(Fig. 5A), which are proportional to the local density of
states, on wires with two- and four-unit-cell width. For
the comparison, spectra of 2D β-RuCl 3with mono and
double layer thicknesses (Fig. 3E), a-Ru-Cl, and HOPG
are also shown. In contrast to semimetallic HOPG with
a linear dispersion, clear gap structures are seen in all
β-RuCl 3, indicating the semiconducting or insulating
electronic structures. To unveil the origin of the energy
gap, we performed systematic band calculations of a 2-
chain wire, a monolayer, and bulk β-RuCl 3, considering
electron correlations and spin-orbit interactions (Fig. 5B-
D). All the cases are metal with a finite density of states
at the Fermi energy unless the electron correlation is in-
cluded, whereas it is turned on, an energy gap opens at
the Fermi energy for all cases, indicating that β-RuCl 3is
a Mott insulator.
Considering Figs. 3A-E, the formation of the nanowire
array appears to be part of the thin-film growth. How-5

ever, it should be emphasized that this crystal growth
process is essentially different from any of the growth
processes previously known: island, layer-by-layer, and
their combination (20–22). It is interesting to note that
the spontaneous formation of distinctive stripe patterns
has been reported in macroscopic and mesoscopic scales
in various chemical and biological systems. Two con-
trasting approaches have been advocated to explain the
stripe pattern formation in the previous systems. One
is an equilibrium process, in which the periodic spatial
organization appears as a result of the static potentials
consisting of competition between attractive and repul-
sive interactions with two different length scales or purely
repulsive isotropic interactions (23–25). The other is
to view the 1D stripe pattern as the result of a dissi-
pative structure that exhibits complex non-equilibrium
reaction-diffusion.
To elucidate the mechanism of the present pattern for-
mation, noteworthy about the observed patterns is the
emergence of several distinct characteristic features dis-
played in Figs. 6A-E, in addition to the stripe patterns.
It should be stressed that from these peculiar patterns,
static interactions are highly unlikely to be the driving
force of the atomic wire array formation. As shown in
Fig. 6A, when the distance between the wires becomes
longer, the stripe patterns disappear, but the wire cross-
ings still remain. These results contradict the pattern
formation driven by static interactions, whether repulsive
or attractive, because crossings typically induce energy
loss if static interactions drive the pattern formation. If
attraction-driven, it is more stable to condense into a 2D
phase separation structure, i.e., crystalline domains. In
the present case, such a crystallized domain has not been
observed. For the repulsion-driven case, the uniformly
dispersed pattern is more stable, which contradicts the
present case with dense and sparse regimes coexisting,as shown in Fig. 6A. Thus, the possibility of the static
interactions can be ruled out as the origin of the atomic
wire patterns.
We point out that non-equilibrium reaction-diffusion
processes may play an essential role in forming the
observed peculiar atomic-wire patterns. Indeed, in
reaction-diffusion systems, the crossings are allowed to
form (26). In addition, as depicted in Fig. 6B, when the
number of wires changes, the Y-junction accompanied
by an edge dislocation appears. For a stripe pattern,
the number of lanes’ discordance is typically resolved in
two ways. One is to narrow the distance between the
lanes. The other one is to form transiently or stationary
emerging Y-junctions, edges of lanes, and shrinking lanes,
which we observed in Fig. 6B. Such a pattern is a typical
fingerprint for the reaction-diffusion process (15, 27).
Moreover, the presence of the phase singularity, an
unique feature in reaction-diffusion systems (28), is
demonstrated by the spiral patterns in Figs. 6C and 6D.
Figure 6C shows a typical winding spiral pattern (see
also Fig. S6). The pattern in Fig. 6D is created as a re-
sult of two waves, one colored yellow and the other or-
ange, propagating from different directions and colliding
with each other. We emphasize that these spiral pat-
terns cannot be generated in the equilibrium systems,
providing strong evidence for the non-equilibrium pro-
cess (26, 28) (see also SI). Furthermore, when the de-
position temperature is lowered to 380◦C, the HOPG
surface with no a-Ru-Cl appears as shown by the black
area in Fig. 6E. The wires do not propagate through a
depletion region by themselves without accompanying a-
Ru-Cl regions nearby, which is confirmed by the height
profile (Fig. 6F) along the orange line in Fig. 6E. The ab-
sence of the propagation of wires to the depletion region
is consistent with the reaction-diffusion picture because
it suggests that the production of atomic-scale wires reg-6

ulates the concentration of the a-Ru-Cl and vice versa.
We note that the STM is too slow to capture the dy-
namic process of the thin-film growth. Therefore, even
though these STM results support the reaction-diffusion
process as the origin of the atomic wire pattern forma-
tion, measurements that can directly detect dynamical
processes in atomic-scale are strongly desired to fully un-
derstand the growth mechanism.
DISCUSSION
Assuming that the reaction-diffusion process is the ori-
gin of the pattern formation of atomic wires, it is tempt-
ing to speculate the stripe pattern to be a manifestation
of Turing instability (15). This instability is the most
prominent mechanism in many different classes of self-
organization processes, leading to the spontaneous emer-
gence of spatially periodic patterns (15). In the following,
we discuss the possibility that the observed patterns are
associated with the Turing instability.
Turing patterns occur when the diffusion coefficient of
an inhibitor is significantly larger than that of an acti-vator; local activation and lateral inhibition destabilize
uniform stationary states. After the first experimental
realization of Turing patterns around 1990 (29, 30), 40
years after Turing’s prediction, the Turing mechanism
has been recognized as a significant driving force that
can induce the chemical (16) and biological (17–19) pat-
tern formations. However, despite its applicability to
various systems with a wide length scale ranging from
more than centimeters to submicrons (31), the atomic-
scale formation of the Turing pattern down to a few
nanometers has been seldom examined. Very recently,
striped wrinkle patterns of the 2D bismuth atoms on
NbSe 2have been discussed in the analogy of the Tur-
ing pattern by associating the atomic displacements with
activator and inhibitor (32). However, further evidence
is required to clarify whether these patterns appear due
to the non-equilibrium self-organization process because
similar patterns can be induced even by an equilibrium
process stemming from the static interactions (23–25).
In addition, the present finding of the atomic-scale wire
fabrication is distinct from these wrinkle patterns on 2D
continuous films, which is essentially a surface recon-
struction phenomenon. Thus, the mechanism that un-7

derlies diffusion-driven instability on the atomic scale,
where quantum mechanics is essentially important, can
be fundamentally different from that on the larger scale.
Moreover, it is an open question whether the large differ-
ences in diffusion rates of reacting species can be satisfied
on the atomic scale.
Despite that the Turing mechanism in atomic scale is
largely unexplored, we point out that some of the ob-
served patterns appear to be consistent with this insta-
bility. Let us deduce an underlying model that describes
the present system following the Turing instability. The
emergence of the depletion areas shown in Fig. 6E sug-
gests the activator-depleted substrate scheme (33), where
the ‘substrate’ denotes the chemically reacting substance.
As schematically shown in Fig. 7A, β-RuCl 3crystal is an
activator that enhances nucleation growth and consumes
the substrate a-Ru-Cl, and the depletion of the sub-
strate acts as an inhibitor in the conventional activator-
inhibitor model for the Turing process. We illustrate the
crystal growth and diffusion process in Figs. 7B and 7C.
The crystal growth of 1D β-RuCl 3wires proceeds along
the chain ([001]) direction because of the quasi-1D crystal
structure of β-RuCl 3.
Since the reaction between the wire and amorphous is
activated more frequently on the side with a higher con-
centration of amorphous, the wires propagate towards
the direction with a higher concentration of a-Ru-Cl,
as illustrated in Fig. 7C. In a typical crystal growth,
the crystal reacts with a-Ru-Cl, resulting in the lateral
growth (layer-by-layer growth). However, in the present
case, the atomic wires do not laterally grow but rather
propagate towards the direction with a higher concentra-
tion of a-Ru-Cl due to the four-chain rule. The diffusionrate of the β-RuCl 3crystal is significantly slower than
that of a-Ru-Cl because of the significant difference be-
tween particle hopping rates in them; The diffusion rate is
proportional to√
N, where Nis the size of the substance.
Since the typical volume of β-RuCl 3wire is more than
100 times larger than that of a-Ru-Cl, the diffusion rate
ofβ-RuCl 3is expected to be more than ten times smaller
than a-Ru-Cl. Note that the volume of a-Ru-Cl is ∼0.2
x 0.2 x 0.2 nm3, while that of the wire is 2 x 0.6 x L nm3,
where Lis the length of the wire. Lis typically longer
than 100 nm in the present case. This suffices the neces-
sary condition for the Turing instability that the diffusion
coefficient of the inhibitor is significantly larger than that
of the activator. As shown in Fig. S5, a reaction-diffusion
model describing the activator-substrate system exhibits
a stripe pattern through the Turing instability (15) (see
SI). Also, we note that while the uniform stripe pattern
appears when the density of atomic wires is high (as
shown in Figs. 3C and 3D), the pattern is not periodic
when the density of atomic wires is low (Figs. 4 and 6A).
We point out that this non-periodic pattern does not rule
out the possibility of Turing mechanism as the origin of
the uniform pattern at high-density (see SI).
The present method of growing uniform atomic wires
also has the potential to be applied to a wide variety
of systems and opens up new avenues for the future of
nanowire technology. The robust and flexible growth of
wires on the atomic terraces has great advantages for the
applications. Applications include the use of atomic pat-
terns as lithographic masks and the use of the nanowires
themselves. We also point out that the present results
are important for the basic science. As shown in Fig. 5,

of the 1D wires to form and decompose β-RuCl 3, but the re-
action is activated more frequently on the side with a higher
concentration of a-Ru-Cl. The atomic wires propagate to-
wards the direction with a higher concentration of a-Ru-Cl.
This process describes the reaction-diffusion origin of the pat-
tern formation.
the electron correlation is predominant for the low-energy
electronic states.
We note that the gap formation due to Peierls insta-
bility is excluded because no dimerization is observed in
the STM images. In this case, the present β-RuCl 3wires
provide a platform for the physics of pure 1D quantum
magnets described by such as Tomonaga-Luttinger liq-
uid and Haldane gap systems (34). Also, it has been
known that another polymorphic form α-RuCl 3with 2D
honeycomb lattice is a candidate material of a Kitaev
quantum spin liquid hosting Majorana fermions (35–
37), which can provide an approach to constructing
a fault-tolerant quantum computer (12). Combined
with α-RuCl 3, the atomic-scale wires and junctions of
β-RuCl 3might be useful for quantum circuits that uti-
lize Majorana fermions. Furthermore, nanowire fabrica-
tion could be realized by the same mechanism in materi-
als with 1D structure similar to β-RuCl 3. For instance,
transition metal trihalides with the same or similar quasi-
1D crystal structure as β-RuCl 3have recently been fo-
cused on, and our method may be applied to this fam-
ily (38). Other exciting candidates with quasi-1D crystalstructures include transition metal chalcogenides such as
WTe 2(39) and M6X6(40).
The fabrication of nanowires and junctions has the po-
tential to significantly increase the integration of elec-
tronic circuits. The present 1D crystalline atomic wires
and their networks provide fascinating physical play-
grounds of non-equilibrium self-organization phenomena
in atomic scale, exotic electronic states and quantum
technologies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample growth: Atomic-scale wires and thin films
ofβ-RuCl 3were grown on the surfaces of HOPG
by the PLD method. To obtain a fresh surface, the
HOPG was cleaved, followed by annealing at 400◦C
for 15 min. The pressure of the PLD chamber was
kept at about 10−5Pa during the deposition. An 81 mJ
pulsed yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser operating at a
wavelength of 1064 nm was used to vaporize a solid
target of high purity α-RuCl 3single crystals, which were
synthesized by the chemical vapor transport method.
To grow the films with atomic layer thickness, a 16-18
ns pulsed laser was used, and the laser power was tuned
by using the attenuator. We find that the βphase of
RuCl 3can be grown at HOPG temperature between 350
and 400◦C in a high vacuum. The growth of β-RuCl 3
was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis of the
thicker films grown on the same deposition conditions.
The growth condition was controlled by changing the
number of pulses, laser power, and HOPG temperature.
After the growth, the films were transferred by a
portable vacuum chamber to the STM chamber to image
topographies and measure the local electronic properties.
STM measurements: The STM experiments were per-
formed with a custom-made Unisoku ultrahigh vacuum
STM at 78 K. The STM tips were electrochemically-
etched tungsten wires cleaned by electron-beam heating
and conditioned on Ag(111) surfaces evaporated on
Si(111) surfaces. The bias voltage was applied to the
sample. All topographic images were taken in the
constant-current mode. The differential conductance
was measured with the standard lock-in technique at
973 Hz with a modulation voltage of 20 mV.
DFT calculations: All calculations are performed on
the experimentally obtained crystal structure taken from
Ref (41). The structure is in the space group 185 P63cm
with lattice parameters a=b= 6.120˚A and c= 5.658˚A,
where the Ru-Ru chains propagate in the c direction. The
Ru-Ru distance within the chain is 2.829 ˚A and there
is no dimerization. This is in agreement with the pre-
sented STM images in this work which do not observe
any dimerization either.
The experimental structure has been additionally com-
pared with the fully relaxed structure obtained within9
DFT via the VASP simulation package (42) version 6.3.0.
As exchange-correlation functional we considered the
Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) (43) where
we included the Coulomb correction via the Dudarev (44)
GGA+U scheme with an effective Coulomb repulsion
Ueff= 3.7 eV. The simulations have been performed with
a planewave cut-off of 600 eV for the expansion of the
basis set, and on a 8 ×8×6 k-mesh. The relaxation is
performed including spin-orbit effects and van der Waals
corrections via the DFT+D2 method of Grimme (45),
using a ferromagnetic state on the Ru sites, until the
forces for each atom in all directions decrease down to
10−3eV/˚A. The comparison shows that the relative dis-
tances between the atoms deviate by a small amount,
approximately 0.02 ˚A, with respect to the experimen-
tally reported distances and therefore we continue with
the experimentally reported structure.
To calculate the electronic properties of the exper-
imental system we use the full potential local orbital
(FPLO) (46) package version 21.00-61 and the Gener-
alized Gradient Approximation (GGA) (43) where we
include the Coulomb correction for the strongly local-
ized Ru 4d electrons via the GGA+U approximation us-
ing the atomic limit method (47). We apply a Coulomb
correction of U= 4.1 eV and J= 0.37 eV, which cor-
responds to approximately Ueff= 3.7 eV. This value is
slightly higher than reported cRPA values for a related
Ru-system, the α-RuCl 3compound (48). Since β-RuCl 3
consists of quasi 1D chains we expect that the screen-
ing effects will be slightly reduced and thus the effective
Coulomb repulsion should be slightly larger. All calcu-
lations are spin polarized with ferromagnetically aligned
magnetic moments on the Ru sites. Due to the heavy
Ru atoms we perform fully relativistic calculations with
a spin quantization axis in the a-direction.
The bulk calculations are performed on a 12 ×12×12
k-grid in the primitive unit cell and density convergence
criterion 1 ×10−6. For the monolayer setting we per-
formed a slab calculations in the a−cplane and consid-
ered void space in the bdirection on a 10 ×1×10 k-grid.
In the 2-chain arrangement we employ void space in the
aandbdirection and 1 ×1×10 k-grid. The monolayer
and 2-chain structure are both converged up to density
accuracy of 1 ×10−4.ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

1arXiv:2305.12700v2  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  23 May 2023REACTION-DIFFUSION MODEL
To explain the stripe pattern of β-RuCl 3, we consider a reaction-diffusion model describ-
ing the activator-substrate system illustrated in Fig. 4a. Let aandsbe the concentration
fields of activator (crystalline β-RuCl 3) and substrate (amorphous a-Ru-Cl), respectively.
The important reaction is that a unit constituting the amorphous becomes a part of the
crystal at the rate proportional to the concentration of the crystal. This auto-catalytic
reaction is suppressed by the depletion of the substrate when its diffusion constant Dsis
much larger than activator’s diffusion Da. The mechanism leads to the Turing instability of
a spatially homogeneous state. As one example, the equations for aandsare written as
∂ta=sa−a−1 +Da(∂2
x+∂2
y)a, (S1)
∂ts=−sa+ 2 + Ds(∂2
x+∂2
y)s, (S2)
where we set Da= 1 and Ds= 20 to satisfy the condition Ds≫Da. The last condition
seems reasonable because the particle hopping rate in the crystalline β-RuCl 3is much smaller
than that in amorphous a-Ru-Cl. Here, the isotropic diffusion is assumed, for simplicity. It
should be noted that the form of Eqs. (S1) and (S2) was introduced by Turing.
By a standard method, it is easily confirmed that the spatially homogeneous state ( a, s) =
(1,2) is unstable against periodic perturbations. We then numerically solve Eqs. (S1)
and (S2) with the boundary conditions n∇a=n∇s= 0, where nis the unit vector
perpendicular to boundaries. We choose an initial condition randomly near the homogeneous
state. Furthermore, in solving the equations, we impose the following additional rule: if the
concentration ais zero and the increasing rate of ais negative, aremains zero. This special
rule was also mentioned in the paper by Turing.
An example of the resulting stationary pattern is shown in Extended Data Fig 6, which
shows an irregular stripe pattern. Also, in Supplementary Movie 2, we show the simulated
nucleation and propagation of wires. Since thin film growth usually occurs from singularities
such as clusters of impurities or steps, the graphite substrate steps are considered to be the
nucleus. Considering this, in this simulation, we use Eqs. (S1) and (S2) as well, but assume
that the initial concentration of ais dense along the left edge of the figure (indicated by
warm color). The movie shows that the ordered wire pattern is spontaneously formed.
Although this simulation based on simple assumptions should be scrutinized more closely,
2it captures an essential feature of the observed patterns.
SPIRAL FORMATION OF STRIPES
Figure 3d shows a spiral of stripes, which is quite unique even in reaction-diffusion sys-
tems. Let us consider a model equation that exhibits such a pattern. First, when the Turing
instability occurs, a plane-wave perturbation with wavenumber vector kgrows at the rate
λ(k). The simplest example of λ(k) is given by
λ(k) =r−(|k|2−k2
c)2, (S3)
where r= 0 corresponds to the onset of instability and kcis the critical wavenumber at
r= 0. The exponential growth due to the instability is saturated by a non-linear effect,
while its detailed mechanism depends on the system under study. Here, we assume that the
activator is described by a two-component field associated with a crystal structure. Let W
be the complex field corresponding to the two-component field. The equation for Wis then
written as
∂tW= (1−(∂2
x+∂2
y+ 1)2)W−(1 +ic)|W|2W, (S4)
where we have set ( r, kc) = (1 ,1) in Eq. (S3), and the last term represents non-linear
saturation. Equation (S4) with c= 0 is called the Swift-Hohenberg equation, which describes
periodic pattern formations in many systems including the Rayleigh-B´ enard convection. The
important property of the Swift-Hohenberg equation is that Wevolves with decreasing a
free energy (or a potential function). It has been known that spirals are never observed in
such potential systems. Now, for the case c̸= 0, the system does not possess a potential,
and thus spirals may be formed. Supplementary Movie 1 displays an example of the time
evolution of the real part of Wforc= 1.
