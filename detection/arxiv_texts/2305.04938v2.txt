Introduction  
Despite the great progress made in the field of vertically 
emitting semiconductor microlasers  within the last two 
decades, t here is still a room for improvement s when 
concerning their  performance, especially when aiming at  
very specific applications , like e.g, laser -based  sensing 
systems  for particular substances . To exploit high 
performance  silicon detectors  in the near infrared range , 
GaAs -based lasers are advantageous. Optically pumped 
micropillar lasers realized in this material system suffer  from 
low power conversion efficiency due to the strong optical 
pump power absorption in the top Al(Ga)As/GaAs DBR  
before it reaches the GaAs cavity and thus the active region  
[2]. A simple solution to the low  power conversion efficiency 
problem has been proposed recently  and relies on  
replace ment of  the conventional Al(Ga)As/GaAs DBRs with 
AlxGa1-xAs/Al yGa1-yAs DBRs  to blueshift the absorption 
edge , when  compared to GaAs  [2],[3]. 
In this article we report on the optical characterization of 
building blocks of a laser structure with 
Al0.2Ga0.8As/Al 0.9Ga0.1As DBR  cavity  and In0.37Ga0.63As 
quantum dots (QDs)  active region  for near infrared spectral 
range . Zero-dimensional structures offer  good thermal 
stability of the threshold current and spectrally  broad gain in 
the range of few tens of nanometers , at the expense of lower 
output power.  The latter is not an issue i n the case  of gas 
detection applications  where  powers on the level of 100 ŒºW 
can be  sufficient  and easily achievable with QDs.  Spectrally 
broad gain enables to cover wider spectral range what gives 
a potential opportunity to fabricate  a tunable laser  or an array 
of lasers  differing in output wavelength on a single wafer , 
both very much demanded in practical gas analyzer systems . 
 
Investigated structures   
The i nvestigated  structures were grown b y metal -organic 
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)  on (001) GaAs 
substrate . GaAs  planar  resonator  with a thickness of ùúÜ was 
create d between  Al0.9Ga0.1Aa/Al 0.2Ga0.8As DBRs - 33.5 pairs 
of layers in the bottom  mirror and 29.5 pairs in the top mirror.  The upper mirror is additionally covered with a layer of GaAs 
with a thickness of ùúÜ/4 to prevent oxidation of  the aluminum -
containing layer s. Inside the cavity there is  a single layer of  
In0.37Ga0.63As/GaAs  QDs formed by self -assembly in 
Stranski -Krastanow growth mode . The dots are optimized to 
have a high surface density of approximately 1.4 √ó 1010 cm-2 
to provide sufficient optical gain for laser applications . We 
also grew a reference structure without DBR s for optical 
characterization of the active region  independent  of the 
cavity . Both structures are schematically shown  in Fig. 1.

cavity ) and the b) sample  with the full DBR -based cavity  
 
Experiment al details  
Optical characterization of both structures was carried out 
with spectroscopy methods  such as photoluminescence 
(PL), temperature -dependent PL and reflectance 
measurements.  The PL measurements were conducted with 
continuous wave  and non -resonant excitation  using 
semiconductor laser with 640 nm output wavelength . Laser 
beam was focused on the sample surface to a spot with 1 Œºm 
diameter using  a long working distance infinity corrected  
microscope objective with numerical aperture of 0.4 . The 
signal was analyzed with 1 m focal length  monochromator 
and nitrogen cooled InGaAs  multichannel linear array 
detector . For temperature -dependent measurements the  
 
sample was mounted in a continuous -flow liquid helium 
cryostat which enabled us to perform measurements in a 
wide temperature range from 10 K up to 400 K.   
Reflectance measurem ents were conducted at room 
temperature  (RT) with  broadband light from a halogen lamp  
modulated at 280 Hz frequency with a mechanical chopper. 
The signal was further dispersed by 30 cm focal length 
monochromator  providing  0.5 meV  spectral resolution  and 
detected with a n InGaAs photodiode followed by a lock-in 
amplifier  for phase sensitive measurements . To comply the 
spectral characteristics of the experimental  setup , a 
reflect ivity spectrum  from a  silver mirror  was measured in the  
same experimental conditions .  
 
Calculations of reflectivity spectra  
In order to verify the nominal parameters of the  DBRs , 
reflect ance  spectr a of the full cavity  (Fig. 1b)  were simulated 
using the trans fer matrix method  [4]. Absorption of incident 
light in the  structure is not taken into account in  this model.  It 
can be neglected in our case as the absorption edge of the 
DBR and cavity material is at higher energies than the DBR 
stopband . Input parameters for calculating the reflect ance  
spectrum are thickness and refractive inde x (which we 
assume d constant in the considered spectral range  and 
equal to the refractive index for the central wavelength of the 
stopband at room temperature ) of all the layers in the 
structure.  This method allows no t only to obtain the 
reflect ance spectrum in order to compare with the 
experimental data and verify the parameters of the fabricated  
structures.  
 
Results  and discussion  
We measured temperature -dependent PL on the 
reference sample  (Fig. 1a) to determine the spectral range of 
emission from QDs , and its thermal stability to identify the 
main PL quenching mechanisms.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. PL  as a function of temperature  measured with ME for the 
reference sample  with QDs (Fig . 1a). Dashed lines indicate the range 
of maximum reflectance of the DBR-based cavity  (Fig. 1b) The measurements were carried out with low excitation 
power density (LE - 350 W/cm2) and medium excitation 
power density (ME - 3.5 kW/cm2). It can be noticed that the 
PL spectrum is rather complex, but in further analysis  we 
consider only the highest intensity emission band 
corresponding to emission from the ensemble of QDs. It can 
be observed for the whole temperature range up to 400 K. At 
low temperatures (LT) it is spectrally located within the 
stopband range of the DBR -based cavity as can b e seen in 
Figure 2. The obtained PL spectra were fitted using Gaussian 
function what enabled us to acquire parameters such as 
peak position, integrated intensity and full width at half 
maximum  (FWHM).  
The PL of QDs  shifts towards higher energies with 
incre asing temperature  (Fig. 3) approximately following the 
empirical equation  for the alloy composition and temperature 
dependence of the semiconductor bandgap in In xGa1-xAs [5] :  
(1)  ùê∏ùëî(ùë•,ùëá)=0.42+0.625 (1‚àíùë•)‚àí(5.8

where the equation uses bandgap energy at 0 K and material 
Varshni parameters Œ± and Œ≤  of binary alloys InAs and GaAs . 
To achieve good agreement of experimental data with above 
equation we needed to add 0.3 eV with respect to the energy 
bandgap of bulk In 0.37Ga0.63As. This difference origins from 
carrier confinement in QDs and the origin of the optical 
transitions which occurs between QD discrete states, in 
contrast to emission from band edges in bulk.

The PL intensity first increases rapidly until 40  K as can 
be seen in Figure 4 . The amplitude of this increase is smaller 
for higher excitation power. This behavior  indicates thermally 
activated trans fer of carriers trapped by  localized states in 
the dots surrounding (e.g. shallow defects) to QDs. The 
amount of transferred carriers increases up to the saturation 
level - filling all available states in the QDs . It can be 
observed for excitation powers below QD saturation 
condition. After this point , the PL intensity is almost constant 
up to 150  K where it starts to decrease as expected due to 
the increas ing probability of non -radiative recombination and 
thermal ly-activated escape of carriers from the QDs due to 
finite depth of confining potential.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 5. Arrhenius plot for reference sample  
 
Based on the determined integrated PL intensities we 
made Arrhenius plots (Fig. 5). The analysis of the 
temperature dependence of the QD emission intensity made 
it possible to determine the activation energies responsible 
for the PL quenching. For the ME case, we used standard 
empirical  Arrhenius function  with a single activation process 
[8]: 
(2)  ùêº(ùëá)=ùêº0
1+ùêµ1exp (‚àíùê∏1
ùëòùêµùëá) 
where I denotes the intensity of the PL, I0 is the initial 
(maximum) intensity, E1 is the characteristic activation 
energy and B1 is a constant, i.e. an amplitude parameter 
reflecting efficiency of the given quenching process . For the 
case of LE there is observed an initial increase of the PL 
intensity with temperature, suggesting thermal activ ation of 
carriers from the traps, therefore we used a modified 
empirical Arrhenius function  [9]: 
(3)  ùêº(ùëá)=ùêº0+ùêºùëÉ[1‚àí(1‚àí1
1+ùêµ2exp (‚àíùê∏2
ùëòùêµùëá))]
1+ùêµ1exp (‚àíùê∏1
ùëòùêµùëá) 
where parameters denote the same as above, except now 
we have to consider E1 and E2 as activation energies with the 
corresponding B1 and B2 constants. Smaller E2 activation 
energy on the order of few meV  (Table in the inset of Fig . 5) 
correspon ds to the trap  activation and subsequent QD filling , 
whereas  the large r activation  energy  E1 correspond s to the 
thermally activated loss of charge carriers . The coupling 
constant B1 (B2) describes the efficiency of intensity 
decrease  (increase) with temperature. Here, we also have to 
take into account Ip which is  the reservoir -gained intensity  to 
describe the initial increase of the emission intensity.  Comparison of the obtained activation energies  (see the 
table in the inset of Fig. 5) with the band structure allow s to 
identify the dominant escape channels of carriers from QDs. 
The characteris tic PL quenching process energy exceed s 
100 meV corresponding to carrier escape to the GaAs 
barrier.  The difference between QD ground state transitions 
energy and GaAs bandgap is about 200 meV , which is further 
divided between the conduction and valence ba nd according 
to band offsets  (not necessarily equally) , translating into 
about 100 meV needed for efficient escape of electrons or 
holes (or both)  from the QD potential . 
The inhomogeneous broadening of emission from a  QD 
ensemble ranges from approx. 20 meV  (at 10 K) to about 80 
meV (at 290 K), similar for both the LE and ME excitation 
conditions. It translates into the FWHM of approx. 65 nm at 
room temeprature, which shows suitability of such active 
region for broadband  gain and therefore the laser tunab ility. 
The cavity characteristics like the mode wavelength , 
central wavelength of the DBR stopband  and width of the 
stopband were obtained by conducting reflectance 
measurements on the full cavity structures with DBRs  (see 
Fig. 6). To confirm  the fabrication accuracy , we performed  
calculations  with nominal parameters  (top graph  in Fig. 6 ). 
The refractive indices  of the (Al)GaAs were  estimated by 
extrapolation and interpolation from reported values  [10-11].

Fig. 6. Reflectance spectrum measured from the sample with DBRs 
compared with calculations with nominal parameters (top) and fitted 
parameters (bottom)  
 
From comparison of the experimental and calculated 
reflectivity data (Fig. 6 top graph) it can be seen  that 
expe rimental spectrum lacks cavity mode and the contrast of 
interference fringes beyond the stopband region is lower. 
The reason for this is low spectral resolution of used 
experimental setup and high Q -factor of the DBR -based 
cavity. To verify the fabrication  accuracy we ran the 
calculations  again  to find out the real parameters of our 
sample, by slightly tuning the thickness of DBR layers from 
the nominal values until we achieved a good agreement of 
calculated spectrum with experimental data (see bottom part 
of Fig.6). It can be seen in the Table 1 with a summary of the 
used parameters in the simulations, that a deviation of layers 
thicknesses from nominal values is less than 1 nm for thin  
 
layers and less than 5 nm for GaAs cavity. This confirms  
overall good accuracy  of the  used  growth method . 
We verified that growth of the DBRs did not influence the 
active region  significantly. The growth process of QDs is 
reproducible which we confirmed by measuring PL on the full 
cavity sample from the edge of the stru cture (directly exciting 
the active region and collecting mainly emission into the 
leaky modes  ‚Äì Fig. 7). The slight difference in QD emission 
between the two samples  is because of modified strain 
conditions due to the existence of the bottom DBR, which 
then affects the QDs ‚Äô morphology . 
Finally, comparing emission from the active region  in the 
full cavity structure (Fig. 1b)  with reflectance  of the cavity  we 
can see  that t he PL peak falls within the stopband  in the 
investigated range of temperatures, i.e. when tuned from LT 
to RT (Fig.7) . The maximum emission peak should be 
aligned to the center of the maximum reflectance of the 
structure  to ensure high QD -cavity coupling efficiency . 
Taking this into account t he structure needs to be  further  
optimized to fully exploit its  potential.  For RT applications 
QDs emission needs to be blueshifted to fit better the cavity 
reflectance maximum.

measured  from structure with DBRs)  
 
Conclusions  
Cavity structure with AlGaAs -based DBRs  and InGaAs 
QDs as the emitters was characterized by optical 
spectroscopy, supported with modeling the reflectivity 
spectra. It is obtained that t he LT emission  of the active 
region fits well into the cavity stopband. The emission of the 
QDs must be slightly blueshifted  if we consider the structure 
for RT applications . This can be achieved by decreasing the 
In content in the QD material. However, this will make the QD 
confining potential shallower and therefore, the GaAs 
barriers have to be r eplaced by wide r bandgap material (e.g., 
AlGaAs) providing deeper confining potential for carriers to 
maintain efficient RT emission.  The thermal stability of the 
emission has been verified by determining the activation 
energies of the PL quenching process es to  exceed 100  meV 
corresponding to carrier escape to the GaAs barrier . The 
investigated  In(Ga)As/GaAs QDs have a confining potential 
deep  enough to emit at RT. On this basis, it can be concluded 
that they are potentially good for use as an active region in 
VCSELs and other optoelectronic devices in the near infrared 
spectral range . Absence of the cavity  mode in the 
experimental reflectance spectrum due to  low s pectral  
resolution suggests  that the cavity ha s a high Q factor  
suitable for laser  applications . Indeed Q -factors exceeding 
10 000 have been observed for such cavities  [12]. The 
emission band width (FWHM) at RT is around 80 meV  (65 nm), which is a good bas e for obtaining broad gain and hence 
application in tunable laser s. 
 
We sincerely appreciate all Reviewers  valuable comments, 
which helped us in improving the quality of the article . We 
acknowledge the suggestion of conducting reflectance 
measurements at an angle to observe  the cavity mode , which 
we will be happy to verify in subsequent measurements.
