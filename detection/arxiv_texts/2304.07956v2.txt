We derive a Markovian master equation for driven open quantu m systems based on the Lewis-
Riesenfeld invariants theory, which is available for arbit rary driving protocols.The role of the Lewis-
Riesenfeld invariants is to help us bypass the time-orderin g obstacle in expanding the propagator of
the free dynamics, such that the Lindblad operators in our dr iven-Markovian master equation can
be determined easily. We also illustrate that, for the drive n open quantum systems, the sponta-
neous emission and the thermal excitation induce the transi tions between eigenstates of the Lewis-
Riesenfeld invariant, but not the system Hamiltonian’s. As an example, we present the driven-
Markovian master equation for a driven two-level system cou pled to a heat reservoir. By comparing
to the exactly solvable models, the availability of the driv en-Markovian master equation is veriﬁed.
Meanwhile, the adiabatic limit and inertial limit of the dri ven-Markovian master equation are also
discussed, which result in the same Markovian master equati ons as those presented before in the
corresponding limits.

I. INTRODUCTION
Any physical system in nature, no matter classical or
quantum, couples to its surroundings exchanging energy
and matter to make it as an open system. The the-
ory of open quantum systems aims at providing a con-
cise manner to describe the dynamics of the primary
system[1]. For open quantum systems satisfying the
Born-Markovapproximation[ 2], the Gorini-Kossakowski-
Lindblad-Sudarshan(GKLS)Markovianmasterequation
gives a general completely positive and trace preserv-
ing map of the reduced dynamics [ 3,4]. In the origi-
nal derivation, it is assumed that the system Hamilto-
nian is time-independent. The coupling to the environ-
ment induces transitions between the static eigenstates
of the system Hamiltonian. For the open systems with
time-dependent external drives, the GKLS master equa-
tionshavebeenderivedinandbeyondtheadiabaticlimit,
which leads to the adiabatic [ 5–9] and non-adiabatic [ 10–
12] Markovian master equation.
Forthe drivenopen quantum systemswithout memory
of the driving protocol, a non-adiabatic Markovian mas-
ter equation (NAME) has been derived [ 11]. The Lind-
blad operators in this non-adiabatic master equation are
eigenoperators of the propagator of the free dynamics
which associates with the system Hamiltonian. Gener-
ally speaking, these eigenoperatorscan be determined by
representing the dynamics in the operator space which is
also known as the Liouvillian space [ 13,14]. However,
it is diﬃcult to give these eigenoperators explicitly, and
∗slwu@dlnu.edu.cn
†yixx@nenu.edu.cntheseeigenoperatorsabsentclearphysicalmeanings. For
second best thing, a method based on the inertial theo-
rem is proposed[ 15]. The inertial theorem relies on a pri-
ori decomposition of the Liouvillian superoperator into a
rapid-changing scalar parameter and a slow-changing su-
peroperator,whichisequivalenttoadditionalrestrictions
on the driving protocol [ 16]. In this way, the Lindblad
operators can be obtained explicitly, if the inertial limit
is reached[ 15–17]. At the same time, eﬀective numerical
methodstosimulatethedrivenopenquantumsystemdy-
namics are also proposed [ 18,19], but may provide less
structural insight into the dynamics.
For the open quantum systems with a static Hamilto-
nian, the population transitions caused by decoherence
occur between the eigenstates of the static Hamiltonian
[1]. Hence, even if the Markovian equation can not be
given explicitly, we may formulate a phenomenological
master equation due to the clearly physical meanings of
the transitions [ 20,21]. However, it is totallydiﬀerent for
the driven open quantum systems with a non-adiabatic
driving protocol, since there is no such a physical mean-
ing for the decoherence-induced transitions. Thus, it is
natural to ask if there is a simple method to formulate
a Markovian master equation for a driven open quantum
system with arbitrarydriving protocolsas we used in for-
mulating the Markovian master equation with the static
Hamiltonian?
In this paper, we derive a driven-Markovian master
equation (DMME) for arbitrary driving protocols by us-
ing the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants (LRIs) [ 22], which
is easy to formulate and has a clear meaning of the
decoherence-induced transitions. Since the solution of
the Shr¨ odinger equation with a time-dependent Hamil-
tonian can be expressed as a superposition of the eigen-2
states of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant with constant
amplitudes [ 23], the unitary operator corresponding to
the free propagator can be written down explicitly. On
the other hand, if the the timescale for the driving pro-
tocol, also known as ”the non-adiabatic timescale”, ap-
proaches to or is larger than the reservoir correlation
time, the memory eﬀect of the driving protocol can not
be neglected. By using the Fourier transformation and
its inverse transformation, we collect the frequency con-
tribution caused by the driving memory eﬀect into the
one-side Fourier transformation of the reservoir correla-
tion function. Thus, the driving memory eﬀect can be
included in the DMME with a concise manner. As we
shall see, the transitions induced by the coupling to the
environment only occur between the invariant’s eigen-
states. Therefore, it is quiet straightforwardto formulate
a DMME for a general driven open system, if its LRIs
are known.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we
present the general formula of the DMME based on
the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants theory. The memory of
the driven protocol is encoded in the decoherence rates
and the Lamb shifts of the DMME. Then, we apply
this DMME to the two-level system with time-dependent
driving ﬁelds in Sec. III, and the correspondingadiabatic
and inertial limits are discussed. We also derived exact
dynamics for the driven two-level system, which will help
to illustrate validity and availability of the DMME. Fi-
nally, the conclusions are given in Sec. IV.
II. GENERAL FORMALISM
In thissection, weapplythe LRIstheorytopresentthe
DMME with explicit mathematical and physical mean-
ing. Consider the dynamics of the total system which is
governed by the Hamiltonian
H(t) =Hs(t)+HB+HI.
Hs(t) stands for the system Hamiltonian; the reservoir is
represented by the Hamiltonian
HB=/summationdisplay

wherebkandωkare, respectively, the annihilation opera-
tor and the eigenfrequency of the k-th mode of the reser-
voir. In the following, the natural units /planckover2pi1=c= 1 are
used throughout. We assume that the system-reservoir
interaction Hamiltonian is given by
HI=/summationdisplay
kgkAk⊗Bk.
AkandBkare the Hermitian operators of the system
and reservoir, respectively. gkstands for the coupling
strength.The von Neumann equation for the density operatorof
the total system in the interaction picture reads
∂t˜ρ(t) =−i/bracketleftig
˜HI(t),˜ρ(t)/bracketrightig
,
where ˜ρ(t) denotes the density operator of the total sys-
tem in the interaction picture, and a similar notations is
applied for the other system and reservoir operators. By
assuming the weak system-reservoir coupling (the Born
approximation), we obtain the Born equation for the sys-
tem density operator ˜ ρs(t),
∂t˜ρs(t) =
−/integraldisplayt

˜HI(t),/bracketleftig
˜HI(t−τ),˜ρs(t−τ)⊗˜ρB/bracketrightig/bracketrightig/bracerightig
.
Here, we have assumed that Tr B{˜HI(t)˜ρ(0)}= 0, and
the initial state of the total system can be written as
˜ρ(0) = ˜ρs(0)⊗˜ρB. The Born approximation assumes
that the coupling between the system and the reservoir
is weak, such that the inﬂuence of the system on the
reservoir is small. If the system evolution time is much
larger than the reservoir correlation time τB, we can re-
place ˜ρs(t−τ) by ˜ρs(t) and the integral limits can be
extended to ∞, which is known as the Markovian ap-
proximation. In such a case, the dynamics governed by
the following Redﬁeld master equation within the Born-
Markovian approximation [ 24],

.(1)
For an operator Aof the system, the corresponding op-
erator in the interaction picture can be connected by an
unitary transformation, i.e.,
˜Ak(t) =ˆUs(t)Ak=U†
s(t)AkUs(t). (2)
Us(t) describing the free propagator of the system satis-
ﬁes a Schr¨ odinger equation for the time-dependent sys-
tem Hamiltonian
i∂tUs(t) =Hs(t)Us(t), Us(0) =I, (3)
which results in Us(t) =Texp/parenleftig
−i/integraltextt
0dτHs(τ)/parenrightig
with the
time-ordering operator T.
To reduce Eq.( 1), a set of eigenoperator of the super-
operator ˆUs(t) are needed, where the eigenoperators sat-
isfy˜Fj(t) =ˆUs(t)˜Fj(0) =λj(t)˜Fj(0) [11]. However, it is
diﬃcult to solve the eigenequation of the superoperator
ˆUs(t) directly. To overcome this diﬃculty, the inertial
theorem has been used to obtain an approximative solu-
tion ofˆUs(t) [15,16]. However, the solution is accurate
only under that the inertial parameter is small, which
requires a slow acceleration of the drive.
In fact, the free propagator of the system can be ob-
tained directly, if the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants for the
systemHamiltonian Hs(t) areknown. ALRI Is(t) forthe3
systems with the Hamiltonian Hs(t) is a Hermitian oper-
ator which obeys an equation in the Schr¨ odinger picture
[23]
i∂tIs(t)−[Hs(t),Is(t)] = 0. (4)

Here,|ψn(t)∝an}bracketri}htis then-th eigenstate of the LRI with a

The LRIs theory was designed to investigate the time
evolution of dynamical systems with an explicitly time-
dependent Hamiltonian [ 23]. The invariants comply with
the following properties: (i) The expectation values of
the LRIs are constant. (ii) The eigenvalues of a LRI
are constant, while the eigenstates are time dependent.
(iii) Any time-dependent Hermitian operator which sat-
isﬁes Eq. ( 4) is a LRI for closed quantum systems. Each
LRI corresponds to a symmetry of the closed quantum
system. Thereafter, the LRIs are successfully applied
to investigate time-dependent problems in quantum me-
chanics [ 25] such as the Berry phase [ 26], the connec-
tion between quantum theory and classical theory [ 27],
and the quantum control [ 28]. At the same time, the
method to construct the LRIs for various quantum sys-
tems has been explored, for instance, the harmonic os-
cillator system [ 23], the few-level systems [ 29,30], the
pseudo-Hermitian system[ 31], and the open fermionic
systems[32]. AlsoageneralmethodforconstructingLRIs
has been proposed[ 33].
By means of the explicit formula of the free evolution
operatorUs(t) (Eq.(7)), the system operator Eq.( 2) in
the interaction picture can be rewritten as

In fact, although we admit non-adiabatic change of
the driving protocol, the DMME presented in Eq.( 19)
describesaMarkoviandynamicsifΓR
mn,m′n′(t)≥0for∀t.
The memory eﬀects of the driving protocol is explicitly
encoded into a convolution with the reservoir correlation
function. In order to connect to the previous results[ 11,
17], we may assume that the change of the phase θk
mn(t)
is slow comparing to the reservoir correlation decay rate.5
Thus, there is a typical timescale τd, called “the non-
adiabatic phase timescale”, deﬁned as[ 11]
τd≡Minm,n,k,t/braceleftbigg∂tθk
mn(t)
∂2
tθkmn(t)/bracerightbigg
,
which is related to the change of the phase in the driv-
ing protocol. Thus, the assumption of the slow changing
phase is equivalent to require that the reservoir corre-
lation time τBhas to be much smaller than the non-
adiabaticphasetimescale τd, i.e.,τB≪τd. Fors∈[0,τB]

which lead to the non-adiabatic Markovian master equa-

The DMME presented in Eq.( 19) does not contain any
approximation on the driving protocol. It is interesting
that both the real and imaginary parts of the one-sided
Fourier transform of the instantaneous reservoir correla-
tion function ¯Λkk(α) are involved in both the Lamb shift
and the decoherence (see Eqs. ( 20) and (21)). For the
Markovian master equation with the static Hamiltonian
and the time-dependent Hamiltonian satisfying τB≪τd,
¯ΛR

¯ΛI
kk(α) just appears in the Lamb shift. As a result, the
positive decoherence rates may not be ensured and ad-
ditional energy level shifts can be observed in the driven
open quantum systems for the timescale τB∼τd.
In the DMME (Eq.( 19)), the jump operator ˜Fmnde-
notes a transition from the state |ψn(0)∝an}bracketri}htto another one
|ψm(0)∝an}bracketri}ht. Inotherwords,thetransitionscausedbythede-

The ﬁrst term in Eq.( 23) attributes to a diﬀerence be-
tween the energyaveragevaluesofthe eigenstates |ψn(t)∝an}bracketri}htand|ψm(t)∝an}bracketri}ht. The second term is a geometric contribu-
tion from the time-dependent eigenstates, while the third
term comes from the phase changing rate in the transi-
tions caused by the interaction Hamiltonian. In the adia-
batic limit, the eigenstates of the LRI are the eigenstates
of the system Hamiltonian, and the adiabatic condition
must be satisﬁed. Thus, the last two terms are no con-
tributions to the instantaneous frequency, while the ﬁrst
term becomes the energy gap between the n-th and the
m-th energy levels, which leads to the adiabatic master
equation given in Ref. [ 6,8].
III. THE DRIVEN OPEN TWO-LEVEL SYSTEM
In this section, we apply the general formulism to a
driven two-level system which couples with a heat reser-
voir. Here, we consider that the driven two-level system
Hamiltonian in a laser adapted interaction picture takes
the form [ 35]
Hs(t) = ∆(t)σz+Ω(t)σx, (24)
where ∆(t) =ω0(t)−ωLis the time-dependent detun-
ing with the time-dependent Rabi frequency ω0(t) and
a constant laser frequency ωL; Ω(t) is time-dependent
driven ﬁeld. The heat reservoir can be represented by
the reservoir Hamiltonian

with Ω k=ωk−ωL, wherebkandωkare the annihilation
operator and the eigen-frequency of the k-th mode of the

For the two-level system governed by the Hamiltonian
Eq.(24), the LRIs have been explored before [ 28,37].
Here, we write the LRIs of the two-level system in form
of the spectrum decomposition
Is(t) =/summationdisplay
k=1,2±ΩI|ψk(t)∝an}bracketri}ht∝an}bracketle{tψk(t)|, (27)

Inserting Eqs. ( 24) and (27) into Eq.( 4), the parameters
η(t) andζ(t) needs to satisfy the following diﬀerential
equation
∂tη= Ω sinζ,
sin2η(2∆+∂tζ) = 2Ω cos2 ηcosζ.(29)
In what follows, we identify the system operator
˜Ax(y)(t) based on the Eq.( 8). On the one hand,
∝an}bracketle{tψm(t)|Ax|ψn(t)∝an}bracketri}htcan be obtained by means of Eqs.( 26)

Thus, the propagator of the free dynamics for the driven

can be written down explicitly accordingto Eq.( 7). From

Based on the parameters provided above, we can ob-
tain the Lamb shifts and the decoherence rates via Eqs.

us take the reservoir to be in an equilibrium state at

decoherence rates can be obtained.
Without any restriction on the driving protocol, the

which correspond to the energy dissipation and the de-

It is noteworthy that the dephasing rates in Eq.( 40) sat-

A. The Adiabatic Limit
In the adiabatic limit, the corresponding LRIs sat-
isfy [Hs(t),Is(t)] = 0, and share the same eigenstates
to the system Hamiltonian. According to Eq.( 29), if
∂tη(t) =∂tζ(t) = 0, it yields sin ζ= 0andtan2 η= Ω/∆.
Thus, we can write down the eigenstates of the system
Hamiltonian (Eq.( 24)) in form of Eq.( 28) with
ζ= 0, η= arccos
−√
2
2/radicaligg√
∆2+Ω2−∆√
∆2+Ω2
.(42)
It can be veriﬁed that
Hs(t)|ψi(t)∝an}bracketri}ht=ǫi(t)|ψi(t)∝an}bracketri}ht
with the eigenvalues of the system Hamiltonian ǫ1,2(t) =
∓√
∆2+Ω2/2. In such a case, the propagator can be
represented in terms of the instantaneous eigenstates of
the system Hamiltonian as shown in Eq.( 7). The phases
in the propagator come back to a sum of the geometric
phases and the dynamical phases.
Here, we consider the situation where gx
k= 0 in the
interaction Hamiltonian Eq.( 25) for allk. Thus, the ex-
pansion coeﬃcients in Eq.( 8) are
ξy
11=ξy
22=|sin2ηsinζ|= 0,
ξy
12=ξy
21=/radicalig
1−sin22ηsin2ζ= 1,
with the phase ϕy
12=−ϕy
21=π/2. Due to∂tζ→0, the
geometric phases in α1andα2are much smaller than8
the coresponding dynamical phases, so that the phase in
Eq.(8) reads
θy
12=α2−α1

0dτ/radicalbig
∆(τ)2+Ω(τ)2+π,

12=/radicalbig
∆(t)2+Ω(t)2,
αy

respectively.
In the adiabatic limits, the reservoir correlation time
τBis much smaller than the non-adiabatic timescale of
the driving protocol τd, i.e.,τB≪τd[16]. Thus the Lamb
shiftsandthedecoherenceratescanbeobtainedfromEq.
(22). By considering Eq.( 36), it yields
ΓR,y
mn(t) = 2γ0(αmn)(N(αmn)+1),(43)
withmn= 12,21. Note that No matter ∆( t) and
Ω(t) are either positive or negative, αy
12(αy
21) is always
positive (negative), and the Planck distribution satisﬁes
N(−αmn) =−(N(αmn)+1). Therefore, the adiabatic
Markovian master equation (AME) for the driven open
two-level system can be written as [ 6,8]

B. The Inertial Limit
A NAME based on the inertial theorem has been
proposed[ 11,15,16], in which the free propagator of the
closed quantum system is determined by decomposing
the dynamical generator in the Hilbert-Schmidt space
into a rapidly changed scalar function and an adiabat-
ically changed matrix. In this subsection, we illustrate
that the NAME based on the inertial theorem is the
DMME as shown in Eq.( 41) in the inertial limits.
Besides the system Hamiltonian given by Eq.( 24), two
following additional operators are needed to determine
the free propagator, which are[ 16]
L(t) = Ω(t)σz−∆(t)σx, C(t) =¯Ω(t)σz(45)
with¯Ω(t) =/radicalbig
Ω2(t)+∆2(t). We may construct the Li-
ouvillian vector as /vector v={Hs(t),L(t),C(t)}. The inertial
theorem requires that the adiabatic parameters for Hs(t)
is constant [ 16], i.e.,
µ=Ω(t)∂t∆(t)−∆(t)∂tΩ(t)
2¯Ω3(t)≡cons..Here, we call the dynamics which satisﬁes the require-
ment of the inertial theorem as the dynamics in the iner-
tial limit. Under the inertial limit mentioned above, we
have∂t/vector w(t) =−i¯Ω(t)B(µ)/vector w(t) with/vector w(t) =¯Ω(0)
¯Ω(t)/vector v(t) and
B(µ) =i
0µ0
−µ0 1
0−1 0
.
As a result, by calculating the eigenstates of B(µ), we
have the eigenoperators of the free propagator
Σx=1
2κ2¯Ω(t)[−µHs(t)−iκL(t)+C(t)],
Σy=1
2κ2¯Ω(t)[−µHs(t)+iκL(t)+C(t)],
Σz=1
κ¯Ω(t)[Hs(t)+µC(t)], (46)
withκ=/radicalbig
1+µ2, which are the Lindblad operators in
the NAME based on the inertial theorem[ 15].
As discussed in Sec. II, the Lindblad operators can
be determined by the eigenstates of the LRIs according
to Eq.(8). For the driven open quantum systems with
the system Hamiltonian Eq.( 24), the eigenstates of Σ z
(Eq.(46)) must be the eigenstates of the LRIs deﬁned in
Eq.(27), since Σ zis Hermitian. In order to verify this
correspondence, we check whether the eigenstates of Σ z
fulﬁll the diﬀerential equation for the parameters of the
LRIsasshowninEq.( 29). Substituting Eqs.( 24)and(45)
into Eq.( 46), the eigenstates of Σ zare obtained straight-
forwardly,

By takingζ,ηand their time-derivatives into Eq.( 29),
it can be verify that, the diﬀerential equations Eq.( 29)
hold in the inertial limits, i.e., ∂tµ//radicalbig
µ2¯Ω2+Ω2→0. In
otherwords, |ϕ1∝an}bracketri}htand|ϕ2∝an}bracketri}htarethe eigenstatesofainertial

In the following, we derive the inertial Markovianmas-
ter equation according to the inertial LRI. Here, we still
consider that gx
k= 0 for allkin the interaction Hamilto-
nianHI. By inserting Eq.( 47) into Eq.( 10), it yields the
expanding coeﬃcients

If we assume that the non-adiabatic timescale τdis great
shorter than the reservoir correlation time τB, we can
determine the Lamb shifts and the decoherence rates ac-
cording to Eq.( 22). By the same procedure in Sec. IIIA,
we obtain the inertial master equation , which has pre-
cisely same representation as shown in Ref. [ 15].
C. Comparison to the Exactly Solvable Models:
the Dephasing Model
Here, we further compare to another toy model, which
is exactly solved in the interaction picture. With the
same system Hamiltonian as shown in Eq.( 24), i.e.,
Hs(t) = ∆(t)σz+Ω(t)σx,
we consider a time-dependent interaction Hamiltonian
HI=A(t)⊗B,
where the system and reservoir operators are
A(t) = sin2ηcosζσx+sin2ηsinζσy+cos2ησz,(49)

ηandζaretime-dependent parametersin the eigenstates

this way, the Hamiltonian in the interaction picture can

/Ωk, thereservoirandtwo-level
system decouple to each other, which leads to an exactlysolvable dynamics of the open two-levelsystem[ 1,38,39].
The detailed derivation can be found in Appendix A.
Putting aside the exact dynamics of this toy model, we
derive the DMME for the open two-level system. Taking
Eqs. (28) and (49) into Eq.( 8), it follows that the am-
plitudes are ξ11=ξ22= 1 andξ12=ξ21= 0 while the
phases and instantaneous frequency read θ11=π,θ22=
0, andα11=α22= 0. Thus we have Γ 12,12= Γ21,21= 0
and Γ11,11= Γ22,22=−Γ11,22=−Γ22,11≡ΓDaccording
to Eq.(15). In view of the reservoir correlation functions
Eq.(34), ΓDmay be taken the following form
ΓD= lim

imation, the real part of Γ Dvanishes, which leads to a
meaningless DMME. Hence, we restrict the upper limit
of the integration over sto bet, but not ∞. The DMME
in the interaction picture can be written as

D. Dissipative Landau-Zener transition
In this subsection, we consider the dissipative Landau-
Zener problem, in which the two-level system couples to
a reservoir at zero temperature. The exact transition
probabilities for such a model have been presented[ 40,
41]. Here, we simulate the open system dynamics of the
dissipative Landau-Zener problem by the DMME, and
show that the transition probability given by the DMME
almost coincides with the exact one. Meanwhile, a clear
physical explanation is also presented.The dissipative Landau-Zener problem is a scattering
problem in the restricted sense that changes in the two-
level system’s state will occur only during a ﬁnite time
interval around t= 0. The two-level system’s Hamilto-
nian has the same form as Eq.( 24), i.e.,
Hs(t) = ∆(t)σz+Ω(t)σx, (52)
with ∆(t) =vt/2 and Ω = Ω 0/2, wherevis the constant
sweep velocity and Ω 0denotes the real intrinsic interac-
tion amplitude between the diabatic states |1∝an}bracketri}htand|0∝an}bracketri}ht.

xandzcomponents of the Pauli operators. The eigen-
states of the LRIs are still given by Eq.( 28), in which
η(t) andζ(t) can be obtained via solving the diﬀerential
equations Eq.( 29) by the help of the system Hamiltonian
Eq.(52). Further, we assume that the interaction Hamil-
tonian takes the same form as Eq.( 25) withgy
k= 0 for
allk, so that we obtain

With the setting above, the DMME for the dissipa-
tive Landau-Zener problem can be written as the same
form as Eq.( 41) with ΓR(I),y
mn= 0. For simplifying our
discussion, we neglect the Lamb shifts ( HLS(t) = 0), and
consider that the reservoir correlation time τBhave to
much smaller than the non-adiabatic phase timescale τd,
i.e.,τB≪τd. According to Eq.( 22) and by using the re-
lations Eqs. ( 35) and (37), the decoherence rates become

we haveN(αy

decay from |ψ2(t)∝an}bracketri}htto|ψ1(t)∝an}bracketri}ht; ifαy

we haveN(αy

decay from |ψ1(t)∝an}bracketri}htto|ψ2(t)∝an}bracketri}ht. Since the instantaneous

In FIG.2(a), we plot the evolution of the population

ρ11≡ ∝an}bracketle{t1|ρs(t)|1∝an}bracketri}ht(the blue solid line) and the closed case
|∝an}bracketle{t1|ψ1(t)∝an}bracketri}ht|2(the yellow dashed line). Since we have se-
lected Ω2
0/v= 4, the adiabatic condition for the Landau-
Zener transition is close to be satisﬁed. Therefore, both
the dissipative case and the closed case give an almost
similar dynamical evolution. On the one hand, the in-
stantaneous frequency αy
12is always positive at the most
of time as shown FIG. 2(b). Hence, the instantaneous
eigenstate |ψ1(t)∝an}bracketri}htmust be the instantaneous steady state
of the DMME (Eq.( 56)). Therefore, in the adiabatic lim-
its, the quantum state ρs(t) must follow with |ψ1(t)∝an}bracketri}ht.
Also we ﬁnd that αy
12<0 at a small interval around
t= 0. At this time, the instantaneous steady state be-
comes|ψ2(t)∝an}bracketri}ht, so that the dissipative dynamical evolu-
tion divides from the closed case. On the other hand, it
can be observed that the transition probability given by
the DMME is very close to the exact one P11(Eq.(57)).

The non-adiabaticcaseis presentedin FIG. 3, in which
we have selected Ω2
0/v= 0.04. For the closed system
case, since the adiabatic condition can not be fulﬁlled,
the quantum state can not follow the eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian into the diabatic state |0∝an}bracketri}ht, which are illus-12
trated by the yellow dashed line in FIG. 3(a). When
the coupling to the reservoir is considered, the result is
entirely diﬀerent. We can observe that the numerical re-
sult given by the DMME is in good agreement with the
exact transitionprobability(the red dotted line). Forthe
exact transition probability (Eq.( 57)), due to Ω2/v≪1,
the eﬀect of the dissipation on the Landau-Zener tran-
sition is dominate, which reduces P11evidently.The de-
crease ofP11can be understood by means of the DMME
(Eq.(56)). As shown in FIG. 3(b), the instantaneous
frequencyαy
12(t) is positive at t<0, so that the instan-
taneoussteadystateoftheDMMEistheeigenstateofthe
LRI|ψ1(t)∝an}bracketri}ht. Whent >0, the instantaneous frequency
αy
12(t) becomes negative. Thus, the instantaneous steady
state of the DMME is turned over to the other eigenstate
of the LRI, i.e., |ψ2(t)∝an}bracketri}ht, fort >0. Therefore, the pop-
ulation will decays into |ψ2(t)∝an}bracketri}htgradually, and the ﬁnal
transition probability becomes ρ11(∞) =|∝an}bracketle{t1|ψ2(∞)∝an}bracketri}ht|.
IV. CONCLUSION
The driven-Markovian master equation is derived by
using the LRI theory within the Born-Markovian ap-
proximation in this paper. Since the unitary operator
associated with the free propagator of the quantum sys-
tem can be decomposed by the eigenstates of the LRI,
our derivation overcomes the time-ordering obstacle in
writing down a exact formula of the propagator for the
free dynamics. Due to the rapid changing of the driv-
ing protocols, the non-adiabatic timescale may approach
to, even is larger than, the reservoir correlation time,
which leads to the memory eﬀect of the driving proto-
cols. The DMME presented here includes this memory
eﬀect, whichleadstoadditionalLambshifts anddecoher-
ence terms. Therefore, the DMME does not contains any
constraint on the driving protocols, such as the adiabatic
or inertial approximation [ 6,16].
According to the DMME, the transitions of the driven
open quantum system occur on the eigenstates of the
LRI, but not on the instantaneous eigenstates of the sys-
tem Hamiltonian. This is very practical in determining
the Lindblad operators in the DMME, if the LRIs areknown[11], which is illustrated by the example of the
driven two-level system. Similar to the Makovian mas-
ter equation with a static Hamiltonian, both the energy
relaxationanddephasingprocessesemergeinthe dynam-
ics of the driven two-level system. But the decoherence
rates and the Lindblad operators are time-dependent,
which implies a time-dependent steady state. Such a
time-dependent steadystateisanimportantcandidatein
the quantum state engineeringof open quantum systems.
What is more, if the reservoiris at low, or ultra-low, tem-
perature, the steady state is close to a pure state which is
one of the eigenstates of the LRI. Therefore, the inverse
engineering method based on the LRIs[ 28,35,42,43] will
be a more promising controlling method than the others
in the ﬁeld of the shortcuts to adiabaticity [ 44,45].
Here, we would like to emphasise that the dynamics
of the driven open quantum systems is closely connected
to the symmetry of the system, which is contained in
the LRIs of the corresponding system Hamiltonian. For
instance, the DMME given in Eq.( 41) can describe the
dynamics only for open two-level systems with the sys-
tem Hamiltonian like Eq.( 24). For diﬀerent types of the
system Hamiltonian, the open system dynamics must be
diﬀerent due to distinct symmetries of the driven sys-
tem. Therefore, to present the LRIs of a particular sys-
tem with a certain driving protocol is a very essential
task in applying the general formula of the DMME [ 33].
For driven two qubits system, a Lie-algebraic classiﬁ-
cation and detailed construction of the LRIs has been
exploited[ 30]. However, for the many body and multi-
level system, this is a hard task[ 46]. Fortunately, there
are many useful (semi-) simple subalgebras in a compli-
cated Lie algebra[ 47], which corresponds to many avail-
able driving potocols. Therefore, the DMME based on
the LRI theory have broad potential applications in the
quantum information process[ 48,49] and the quantum
thermodynamics[ 50,51].
