Abstract
We construct and discuss new solutions of primary hair charged black holes in asymp-
totically Anti–de Sitter (AdS) space that have well-defined Coulomb-like potential in three
dimensions. The gauge field source to the Einstein equation is a power-Maxwell nonlinear
electrodynamics with traceless energy-momentum tensor. The coupled Einstein-power-
Maxwell-scalar gravity system, which carries the coupling f(ϕ) between the gauge and
scalar fields, is analyzed, and hairy charged black hole solutions are found analytically.
We consider three different profiles of the coupling functions: (i) f(ϕ) = 1, correspond-
ing to no direct coupling between the gauge and scalar fields, (ii) f(ϕ) =eϕ, and (iii)
f(ϕ) =eϕ2/2, corresponding to their non-minimal coupling. For all these cases, the scalar
field and gauge fields, as well as curvature scalars, are regular and well-behaved every-
where outside the horizon. We further study the thermodynamics of the obtained hairy
black hole in the canonical and grand-canonical ensembles and find significant changes
in its thermodynamic structure due to the scalar field. In particular, for all considered
coupling functions, the hairy parameter has a critical value above which the hairy black
hole undergoes the Hawking/Page phase transition, whereas below which no such phase
transition appears.
1 Introduction
For many years, physicists and astronomers have been fascinated by the black hole mys-
teries and their fascinating nature. The study of black holes gives a unique platform
to view the behaviour of matter and energy under extreme circumstances and provides
insights into basic principles of general relativity. They offer a unique framework for the
coexistence of strong gravity, quantum phenomena, and thermodynamics. It is now widely
accepted that black holes carry both temperature and entropy and may experience phase
transitions much as ordinary thermodynamic systems [1–3]. For instance, in contrast to
the Schwarzschild black hole in asymptotically flat space, black holes in anti-de Sitter
(AdS) spaces are not only thermodynamically stable but also exhibit rich thermodynamic
phase structures and go through phase transitions such as the Hawking/Page (black hole
to thermal-AdS) or the small/large black hole phase transitions [4–11].

1arXiv:2401.04561v1  [gr-qc]  9 Jan 2024Due to their intrinsic simplicity compared to their higher-dimensional counterparts,
studies of lower-dimensional gravitational systems have drawn a lot of interest. The prime
example is the three-dimensional BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) black holes, which
have received a lot of attention in the last three decades and have shown to be useful simpli-
fied models for investigating conceptual issues of black holes [12,13]. For example, general
relativity becomes a topological field theory in the three dimensions, whose dynamics can
be mapped holographically to the two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) living at
the boundary of spacetime [14]. The BTZ black holes, therefore provide a natural arena
to test the deep and fundamental principles of gauge/gravity duality [15]. The use of
conformal boundary conserved charges and symmetric algebra to calculate the entropy of
BTZ black holes provides a prime example of the usefulness of lower-dimensional gravity
systems to get possible insight into quantum gravity [16]. In addition, the Chern-Simons
(CS) formulation of three-dimensional gravity models has made them quintessential for
investigating general properties of gravity, and in particular its relationship with gauge
field theories [17, 18]. Indeed, despite having various contrasting features compared to
their higher-dimensional counterparts – such as not containing any curvature singularity
or being locally equivalent to pure AdS 3– the BTZ black holes do exhibit many of their
fundamental features, such as the presence of event and Cauchy horizons, or their thermo-
dynamic and holographic interpretations [19]. For these reasons, the lower-dimensional
models continue to be the focus of considerable interest in gravitational theories [20,21].
The repertory of three-dimensional black hole solutions has greatly broadened in a
number of ways since the seminal discovery of the BTZ solution. In addition to the tradi-
tional Maxwell term [22], higher-order curvature terms [23], higher-rank tensor fields [24],
gravitational Chern-Simons terms [25] etc have been added in the gravity action. The
extension also includes a variety of other matter sources. These advancements have im-
proved our knowledge of lower-dimensional black hole solutions and their interactions with
various types of matter. The Maxwell Lagrangian, L(F) =F=FµνFµν, in particular,
leads to an interesting but undesirable behaviour in three dimensions, i.e., the electric
field and potential of the black hole are now proportional to 1 /rand log rrespectively,
rbeing the radial coordinate, as opposed to 1 /r2and 1 /rbehaviour in four dimensions.
Consequently, divergence terms appear in the metric and gauge field, as log( r) blows up
atr= 0 and r=∞, making the charged BTZ solution unattractive. This raises the
potential question: is it possible to construct a Lagrangian for the gauge field that will
give us a gauge field solution just like in the case of (3 + 1) dimensions, i.e., a regular and
well-behaved gauge field solution? This question was addressed in [26], where the answer
was found in the affirmative. The essential idea was to require, as in four dimensions,
the trace of the gauge field energy-momentum tensor to be zero. This condition uniquely
constrained the gauge field Lagrangian to be power-like with exponent 3 /4, i.e., for the
power law Lagrangian L(F) = (sF)p, the trace
T=Tµνgµν= 3L(F)−4FL,F= (3
2−2p)(sF)p
vanishes for the exponent value p= 3/4. It is straightforward to check that this traceless
nonlinear electrodynamics
L(F) = ( sF)3/4
causes the radial dependence of electric
field and potential to be 1 /r2and 1 /rin (2 + 1) dimensions, respectively. Moreover,
this energy-momentum tensor also fulfils the weak energy conditions. Adding this non-
linear Lagrangian to the Einstein-Hilbert action further gives three-dimensional black
hole solutions with finite gauge field everywhere [26], unlike the usual charged BTZ black
hole [22]. Subsequently, several works have investigated various properties of these (2+1)-
dimensional black holes with a Coulomb-like field [27–41].
In a similar vein, numerous hairy black hole solutions involving self-interacting real
scalar field, both minimally and non-minimally coupled, have been investigated in three-
dimensional spacetime following the initial work of [42, 43]. The investigation of the
2interplay between scalar fields and black holes in three dimensions has not only improved
our understanding of the interaction between them but also has opened up a wide range
of their potential applications, especially in the context of AdS spaces, i.e., the scalar-
gravity models are very pertinent to holography and are useful resources for studying
lower-dimensional condensed matter systems at strong couplings. The desirable trait of
analytical tractability of three-dimensional scalar gravity models has also greatly piqued
our curiosity [44–65]. Nonetheless, it should be emphasised that not all scalar field-dressed
black hole solutions obtained in three dimensions have desirable physical properties. In
many cases, the scalar field not only shows logarithmic radial dependency, thereby making
them unsatisfactory but also the geometry does not asymptote to AdS at the boundary
[54,58].
Another important reason for greatly investigating scalar-gravity systems is due to
their connections with the no-hair theorem. The no-hair theorem basically asserts that
black holes in the asymptotically flat spaces are uniquely described by their mass, charge,
and angular momentum [66]. Many strong arguments and critical remarks in favour of
the no-scalar hair theorem for asymptotic flat space-time were discussed in [67–69], and
has long been thought to apply to black holes in general. For a review on the issue of
scalar hair in asymptotic flat spaces, see [70]. While multiple subsequent investigations
have endorsed the original no-hair theorem for black holes [71–78], it is crucial to keep in
mind that it is not a theorem in the strict mathematical sense. Many counterexamples
have contested the no-hair theorem over time. The Einstein-Yang-Mills theory [79–81],
dilatonic black holes [82], black holes with Skyrme hairs [83, 84], black hole hair with
tensor vacuum [85, 86] are a few instances of these counterexamples. In recent years,
many works addressing various physical properties of the hairy black holes in different
asymptotic spaces have appeared; for a necessarily biased selection, see [87–113].
The analytical tractability of scalar gravity systems in three dimensions have made
them great laboratories for discussing the no-hair theorem [27]. It is then natural to
construct and investigate analytic scalar hair black hole solutions with a well-behaved
Coulomb-like structure for the gauge field using the Einstein-power Maxwell-scalar gravity
system. Such solutions have been obtained in relatively few systems [114–117]. However,
the scalar field in these hairy solutions depends logarithmically on the radial coordinate
and therefore, diverges at the boundary. Moreover, the solutions do not asymptote to
AdS at the boundary, thereby severely restricting their potential applicability.
From the thermodynamic perspective as well, the scalar hair can change the thermo-
dynamic phase structure of three-dimensional black holes considerably. In particular, the
black hole temperature exhibits multiple branches in four and higher dimensions, allowing
for the possibility of phase transitions as the temperature varies. Two prominent exam-
ples of such phase transitions are the Hawking/Page phase transition between AdS black
holes and thermal-AdS in the grand canonical ensemble and the liquid/gas type phase
transition between small and large black holes in the fixed charge ensemble. Whereas
the temperature profile in BTZ black hole exhibits only one branch, displaying no phase
transitions in both charged and uncharged cases. However, recently, it was observed that
certain three-dimensional hairy black holes, obtained from the potential reconstruction
technique, can exhibit such phase transitions in the presence of nontrivial primary scalar
hair [118]. In particular, it was observed that depending on the coupling function f(ϕ)
between the gauge and scalar field, the primary scalar hair can greatly influence the phase
structure of three-dimensional black holes and resemble them to that of higher-dimensional
charged AdS black holes.
Since the addition of scalar and gauge fields to Einstein’s gravity usually generates
unexpected and exciting features in black hole solutions, it is instructive to find new
exact solutions to the Einstein-power Maxwell-scalar gravity system for arbitrary coupling
functions and investigate how the geometrical and thermodynamical properties of black
holes are altered in the presence of a scalar field. In particular, it is interesting and
3desirable to have three-dimensional primary hair black hole solutions, with not just a
regular profile of the scalar field but also of the gauge field, as such solutions might have
applications in applied holography. In this work, we find a family of such solutions.
This paper introduces analytical charged primary hair black hole solutions in three
dimensions with a power Maxwell field, whose thermodynamic structure is somewhat
similar to that of charged AdS black holes in higher dimensions. We focus on the Einstein-
power Maxwell-scalar gravity system, which has a coupling function f(ϕ) between the
scalar and power Maxwell fields, and use the potential reconstruction technique [119–128]
to simultaneously solve the coupled Einstein-power Maxwell-scalar field equations in terms
of functions f(ϕ) and A(z) (see the next section for details). The different forms of f(ϕ)
andA(z) then allow us to construct a different family of hairy black hole solutions. To
make the analysis and findings more thorough, we choose three different but physically
motivated forms of the coupling function: (i) f(ϕ) = 1, (ii) f(ϕ) =eϕ, and (iii) f(ϕ) =
eϕ2/2. While the second and third coupling functions relate to a non-minimal coupling
between the scalar and gauge fields, the first coupling function indicates that there is no
direct coupling between them. The primary reason for taking into account such coupling
functions is the fact that they have recently been thoroughly investigated in a variety
of higher-dimensional hairy black hole contexts, from scalarization to holographic model
construction [95], and have consistently contributed to our understanding of the hairy
aspects of black holes. Therefore, it is intriguing to look into how these coupling functions
affect the geometrical and thermodynamical features of three-dimensional black holes as
well. We similarly take a particularly simple form of A(z) =−a2z2, which enables us to
introduce the parameter a, which regulates the strength of the scalar field.
For all forms of A(z) and f(ϕ) considered here, the found hairy black hole solutions ex-
hibit many attractive features. This includes: (i) the scalar field is finite and well-behaved
everywhere in the outer horizon region and falls off at the asymptotic AdS boundary; (ii)
the gauge field is also finite everywhere outside the horizon; (iii) the curvature scalars,
such as the Kretschmann and Ricci scalars, are also finite everywhere outside the horizon,
suggesting no additional singularity in the hairy solution than those already present in
the nonhairy case; (iv) these hairy solutions can be analytically continued to standard
BTZ solution in the limits {a→0, qe→0}; and (v) the potential is bounded from above
from its UV boundary value, thereby satisfying the Gubser criterion to have a well-defined
boundary theory [129].
We then analyze the thermodynamic structure of the obtained hairy solutions in the
canonical and grand-canonical ensembles and find that it changes significantly when the
hairy parameter ais turned on. In particular, for all considered coupling functions, and
in both canonical and grand-canonical ensembles, a critical value of the hairy parameter
a=acappears (which is a f(ϕ) dependent quantity) above which the hairy black hole
undergoes the Hawking/Page phase transition to thermal-AdS phase, whereas no such
phase transition appears below ac. For the uncharged qe= 0 case, the Hawking/Page
phase transition exists for all finite values of a. The corresponding transition temperature
also increases monotonically with a. Moreover, the critical value acturns out to be a µe
andqedependent quantity in the grand-canonical and canonical ensembles respectively,
i.e., its magnitude increases as µeorqeincreases. This thermodynamic behavior of the
hairy black hole is therefore analogous to the BTZ black hole for a < a cwhereas it
resembles RN-AdS black hole in the grand-canonical ensemble for a > a c. Moreover, we
find that these primary hair black holes are also thermodynamically stable as they exhibit
positive specific heat.
The paper is structured as follows: In Sec. 2, we discuss the three-dimensional Einstein-
power Maxwell-scalar gravity model and present its analytic solution in terms of two
functions f(ϕ) and A(z). In Sec. 3, we study the geometrical and thermodynamical
properties of hairy black hole solution for the coupling f(ϕ) = 1. In Sec. 4 and 5, we
4repeat the calculations with different couplings f(ϕ) =eϕ, and f(ϕ) =eϕ2/2. Finally, in
Sec. 6, we conclude and summarize our results.
2 Hairy charged black hole Solution
To construct hairy charged black holes with power Maxwell-like electrodynamics in three
dimensions, we start with the following gravity action
S=−1
16πG 3Z
d3x√−g
R−1
2gµν∂µϕ∂νϕ−V(ϕ) +f(ϕ)
4(sF)3

, (2.1)
where Rdenotes the Ricci scalar of the three-dimensional manifold M,V(ϕ) is the po-
tential of the scalar field ϕ,f(ϕ) corresponds to the coupling between the gauge and
scalar fields, and Fµνis the field strength tensor. In terms of the four-potential Bµ,Fµν
is expressed as Fµν=∂µBν−∂νBµ. Note that, as discussed in the introduction, the
electromagnetic part of the action is traceless.
The variation of Eq. (2.1) gives the following Einstein, gauge, and scalar field equations:

∂µ[√−gf(ϕ)(sF)−1

1√−g∂µ[√−g∂µϕ] +1
4f′(ϕ)(sF)3
4=∂V(ϕ)
∂ϕ, (2.4)
where f′(ϕ) denotes the derivative of the coupling function with respect to the field ϕ.
We consider the following Ans¨ atze for the metric, scalar field, and gauge field to construct
a static and spherically symmetric ( S1) hairy black hole solution in three dimensions:
ds2=L2
z2
−g(z)dt2+e2A(z)dz2
g(z)+dθ2
,
ϕ=ϕ(z), B µ=Bt(z)δt
µ, (2.5)
where A(z) is the form factor, whose form will be crucial in determining the hairy black
hole solution and the corresponding thermodynamics, Lis the AdS length scale, which we
will set to one from here on for simplicity, and g(z) is the blackening function. The radial
coordinate zranges from z= 0 (asymptotic boundary) to z=zh(black hole horizon
radius) or to z=∞for thermal-AdS (without horizon).
There is only one non-zero component of Faraday’s tensor in the geometry defined
by (2.5), and that is Ftz=−B′
t(z). So we can write F= 2F2
tzgttgzz= 2B′2
t(z)gttgzz.
As a result, we set s=−1 to have real solutions for the gauge field while considering
the electromagnetic Lagrangian’s fractional power and maintaining generality. Now using
Eq. (2.3), we get
Ftz=−B′
t(z) =−√
2qeeA(z)
f(ϕ)2, (2.6)
where qeis an integration constant related to the charge of the black hole (see below).
Similarly, by substituting (2.5) into (2.2), we get the following three Einstein equations
of motion,
tt≡g′(z)−g(z)2
z+ 2A′(z) +1
2zϕ′(z)2
−V(ϕ)e2A(z)

The above three equations can be further rearranged into the following equations,
g′′(z)−g′(z)1
z+A′(z)
−3f(ϕ)e2A(z)(sF)3
4
8z2= 0, (2.10)

z
2V(ϕ)e2A(z)
z2−f(ϕ)e2A(z)(sF)3
4
8z2= 0. (2.12)
Similarly, the scalar field equation of motion is given by
ϕ′′(z)−ϕ′(z)
A′(z)−g′(z)
g(z)+1
z
−e2A(z)
z2g(z)∂V(ϕ)
∂ϕ−e2A(z)(sF)3/4
4z2g(z)∂f(ϕ)
∂ϕ= 0.(2.13)
Therefore, overall, we have five equations of motion in the gravity system of Eq. (2.1).
However, only four of them are independent. It can be explicitly checked that the last
Eq. (2.13) follows from the Bianchi identity and is therefore redundant. Below we will
choose Eq. (2.13) as a constrained equation and consider the rest of the equations as
independent. We now impose the following boundary conditions to solve these equations:
g(0) = 1 ,and g(zh) = 0 ,
Bt(0) = µe,and Bt(zh) = 0 ,
A(0) = 0 . (2.14)
The boundary conditions at z= 0 are chosen to ensure that the spacetime asymptotes
to AdS at the boundary. The parameter µeis the leading term of the near boundary
expansion of the gauge field Bt(z) and corresponds to the chemical potential of the theory.
Using Gauss’s theorem, we can also find a relation between µeand the electric charge of
the black hole (see the discussion below). In addition to these boundary conditions, we
further require that the scalar field goes to zero at the boundary ϕ(0) = 0 and must
remain real throughout the bulk.
Using the above boundary conditions and solving Eq. (2.6), we get the following solu-
tion for the gauge field
Bt(z) =√
2qeZzh
zdξeA(ξ)
f2(ξ). (2.15)
Similarly, by solving Eq. (2.10), the solution for g(z) is
g(z) =C1+Zz
0dξ eA(ξ)ξ
C2+K(ξ)
, (2.16)
6where
K(ξ) =3q3/2
e
2√

dξeA(ξ)
f2(ξ), (2.17)
where the integration constants C1andC2are,
C1= 1, C 2=−1 +Rzh
0dξ eA(ξ)ξK(ξ)Rzh
0dξ eA(ξ)ξ. (2.18)
The expression of scalar field ϕcan be similarly found by solving Eq. (2.11)
ϕ(z) =Z
dzr
−2A′(z)
z+C3, (2.19)
where C3can be obtained by demanding ϕto vanishes near the asymptotic boundary,
i.e.,ϕ|z=0→0. Lastly, the potential Vcan be found from Eq. (2.12),
V(z) =1
16e−2A(z) 
8z2A′(z) + 24 z
g′(z) +1
16e−2A(z)g(z) (−16zA′(z)−32)

e−2A(z)B′
t(z)23/4
84√
2−1
2z2e−2A(z)g′′(z). (2.20)
It is thus clear that Eqs. (2.15)-(2.20) exhibit a closed-form analytic solution of the gravity
system of Eq. (2.1) in (2 + 1)-dimensions in terms of two functions A(z) and f(z). The
constructed hairy solution will depend only on A(z) once the coupling function f(ϕ)
is fixed. However, different forms of A(z) and f(ϕ) will correspond to different V(z),
i.e., various A(z) and f(ϕ) will ascribe to different (2 + 1)-dimensional hairy black hole
solutions. Therefore, by selecting different forms of A(z) and f(ϕ), one may systematically
construct a vast family of physically permissible primary hair charged black hole solutions
for the Einstein-power Maxwell-scalar gravity system in (2 + 1)-dimensions.
In the context of applied gauge/gravity duality, the forms of A(z) and f(ϕ) are often
determined or fixed by demanding a sensible dual boundary field theory. In particular,
suitable forms of A(z) and f(ϕ) are typically taken depending on the sort of boundary
field theory one is interested in. For instance, in the field of holographic QCD, the
forms of these functions are typically fixed by requiring the dual boundary field theory to
exhibit genuine QCD characteristics, such as confinement/deconfinement phase transition
[130–132], confinement in the quark sector, linear Regge trajectory for the excited meson
mass spectrum, etc. In such model-building cases, the form A(z) =−a2z2is generally
considered [119,123,125].
However, we can also take a more liberal and phenomenological approach and investi-
gate various physically motivated forms of A(z) and f(ϕ) to thoroughly discuss the effects
of scalar hair and make qualitative arguments about the stability and thermodynamics
of the hairy charged black holes in three dimensions with Maxwell-like electrodynamics,
without worrying too much about the dual boundary field theory. Here, we take such
an approach. In particular, we take three physically motivated forms of the coupling
function: (i) f(ϕ) = 1; (ii) f(ϕ) =eϕ; and (iii) f(ϕ) =eϕ2/2. As mentioned earlier,
these three types of couplings have recently received a lot of attention in several contexts
involving hairy black holes, for example, see [95]. It is, therefore, interesting to examine
how these coupling functions influence the hairy black hole structure in three dimensions
as well. Similarly, following [109], we focus on a particularly straightforward form of
A(z) =−a2z2. In addition to being simpler, this form of A(z) is particularly chosen
as it gives us more control over the integrals that show up in the solutions of various
geometric functions discussed above. This form of A(z) has also been widely employed
7in the holographic QCD literature; for instance, see [119,123]. With the considered form
ofA(z) =−a2z2, the parameter adetermines the strength and backreaction of the scalar
field. As a result, the scalar field back-reaction drops to zero when the parameter agoes
to zero. Thus, as desired, one returns to the charged BTZ black hole-like solution with
Maxwell-like electrodynamics in the limit a→0.
There are also other important reasons for taking the above-mentioned forms of f(ϕ)
andA(z):
•They ensure that the obtained hairy solution asymptotes to AdS, i.e., at the bound-
aryz→0, we have
V(z)|z→0=−2
L2+m2ϕ2
2+. . . ,
V(z)|z→0= 2Λ +m2ϕ2
2+. . . , (2.21)
where, as usual, Λ = −1
L2is the negative cosmological constant in three dimensions.
Similarly, the Ricci scalar Rapproaches −6/L2asymptotically. This, together with
the fact that g(z)|z→0= 1, indeed ensures that the obtained solutions asymptote to
AdS at the boundary. Moreover, the mass of the scalar field m2=−1 also satisfies
the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound for stability in AdS space, i.e., m2≥ −1 [133].
•Furthermore, as we will show shortly, the hairy solutions satisfy the Gubser criterion
to have a well-defined dual boundary field theory [129].
•These forms of f(z) and A(z) also ensure that the null energy condition is always
respected in our gravity model. The null energy condition can be expressed as
TMNNMNN⩾0, (2.22)
where the null vector NMsatisfies the condition gMNNMNN= 0 and TMNis the
energy-momentum tensor of the matter fields. The null vector NMcan be chosen
as
NM=1p
g(z)Nt+cosαp
g(z)
eA(z)Nz+ sin αNθ, (2.23)
for arbitrary parameter α. The NEC then becomes
TMNNMNN=3zf(z) sin2α 
e−2A(z)B′
t(z)23/4
84√
2+1
2e−2A(z)g(z) cos2αϕ′(z)2⩾0,
(2.24)
which is always satisfied everywhere outside the horizon for the chosen forms of A(z)
andf(ϕ).
Now that the hairy black hole solutions have been constructed, let us write down the
expressions for various thermodynamic quantities. This will be useful later in discussing
hairy black hole thermodynamics. The black hole temperature ( T) and entropy ( SBH)
are given by:
T=−e−A(zh)g′(zh)
4π,
SBH=A
4G3=2π
4G3zh,(2.25)
where A= 2π/zhis the area of the event horizon. Similarly, we can compute the electric
charge Qof the black hole by measuring the flux of the electric field at the boundary,
Q=1
16πG 3Z
f(ϕ) (sF)−1
4Fµνuµnνdθ , (2.26)
8where uµandnνare the unit space-like and time-like normals to the constant radial
surface, respectively
uµ=1√−gttδµ
t=z

g(z)δµ
t,
nν=1√gzzδν
z=zp
g(z)
LeA(z)δν
z,(2.27)
and d θrepresents the integration across the one-dimensional boundary space. Using (2.6),
and after simplification, we obtain the following expression of the black hole charge:
Q=√qe
16πG 3. (2.28)
We can also find a relation between the electric charge and the corresponding conjugate
chemical potential µe. The chemical potential is the leading term of the near boundary
expansion of the gauge field Bt(z). Substituting Bt(z) from Eq. (2.15) into Eq. (2.6), we
get
µe=√
2qeZzh
0dξeA(ξ)
f2(ξ). (2.29)
With hairy black hole solution in hand, let us also mention that there exists another
solution to the gravity equations of motion. This solution does not exhibit the horizon
and is called thermal-AdS.1The thermal-AdS solution can be derived from the black hole
solution by taking the limit zh→ ∞ . Depending on the nature of A(z), the thermal-AdS
may have a non-trivial structure in the bulk. However, due to the imposed boundary
conditions (2.14), and just like in the case of black hole solution, it always asymptotes to
AdS at the boundary. Intriguingly, as we shall show later, depending on the magnitudes
ofaand{µe, qe}, there may also be a Hawking/Page type thermal-AdS/black hole phase
transition between these two solutions.
3 Hairy Black hole solution with coupling f(ϕ)= 1
In this section, we will first look at the geometric and thermodynamic properties of the
hairy black hole solution for the simplest coupling function f(ϕ) = 1. With the considered
form factor A(z) =−a2z2, the solution for the scalar field is:

From the equation (2.6), we have Ftz=−√
2qee−a2z2. This gives us the gauge field
solution
Bt(z) =√πqe(erf(azh)−erf(az))√
2a, (3.2)
where erf is the error function. Notice that the scalar field vanishes in the limit a→0.
Similarly, in the limit a→0, the gauge field also reduces to
Bt(z) =√
2qe(zh−z), (3.3)
indicating that the electrodynamics employed here in three dimensions for a nonhairy
black hole is Maxwellian type. Using Eq. (2.29), we can further find the relation between

curves correspond to a= 0, 0 .1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0 .5, respectively.
In Fig. 1, the radial profile of g(z), Kretschmann scalar RµνρσRµνρσ, scalar field,
and the potential is shown for different values of scalar hair parameter a. Note that, at
z=zh,g(z) changes its sign, indicating the presence of a horizon. This is true for all
10values of a. Similarly, the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars are finite everywhere outside
the horizon. The curvature singularity appears only at z= 1/r=∞, which is shielded by
the horizon. Therefore, there is no additional singularity in the hairy black hole case than
those already present at the nonhairy charged BTZ black hole. Note that in the usual
three-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell gravity system, the curvature is constant throughout
the spacetime for the uncharged BTZ case. The curvature singularity arises only when
the charge is added. The same is true for the Einstein-power Maxwell gravity system.
However, in the presence of scalar hair, the curvature singularity can arise even when
the charge is zero, i.e., the strength of the singularity increases with the scalar hair. In
particular, RµνρσRµνρσ∝z2for the charged BTZ case, whereas RµνρσRµνρσ∝z6for the
hairy case of fractional power law electrodynamics employed here. This can be clearly
observed in Fig. 1(b). Interestingly, compared to the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar gravity
system, where there is an additional logarithmic singularity at the centre of the black
hole ( RµνρσRµνρσ∝z6logz) [118], the strength of the singularity is milder in the case
of Einstein-power Maxwell-scalar gravity system where no such logarithmic singularity
arises. This is expected considering that the gauge field gives log zcontribution to g(z),
thereby giving additional log zcontributions to the curvature scalars in the Einstein-
Maxwell theory, whereas no such contribution arises in the Einstein-power Maxwell theory.
Also, the scalar field is finite and real everywhere at and outside the horizon and only
goes to zero at the asymptotic boundary. This suggests the presence of a well-behaved
hairy black hole solution with Maxwell-like electrodynamics in three dimensions. In the
outer horizon area, the potential is similarly regular and limited. The potential asymptotes
toV(z= 0) = −2/L2at the boundary for all aandqe. Moreover, provided that the charge
qeis not too large, the potential is also bounded from above by its UV boundary value,
i.e.,V(0)≥V(z), hence satisfying the Gubser criterion to have a well-defined boundary
field theory [129]. However, the said criterion can be violated for higher values of qe≳5.
In the rest of the work, we will concentrate on only those parameter values for which the
Gubser criterion is respected.
Now, let us discuss the thermodynamics of the black hole. For f(ϕ) = 1, the expression
of the black hole temperature is given by:

which also indicates that the black hole can become extremal when the charge is added

Let us first discuss the black hole thermodynamics in the grand-canonical ensemble.
Fig. 2 illustrates the temperature variation with regard to the (inverse) horizon radius
zhfor various values of hairy parameter a. Here we have kept µe= 0 fixed, which is
also equivalent to qe= 0. Observe that for a= 0 (red line), there is only one black
hole phase. The temperature of this phase decreases with zhand has a positive specific
heat. Correspondingly, this black hole phase is thermodynamically stable. The local
thermodynamic stability of the hairy black holes will be discussed shortly. This is an
expected result considering that for a= 0 and µe= 0, our hairy solution reduces to the
stable uncharged BTZ black hole, which is thermodynamically stable at all temperatures.
The thermodynamic structure changes drastically when the hairy parameter ais
switched on. With finite a, there are now two black hole phases at a fixed tempera-
ture: a small phase (unstable) and a large phase (stable). These stable and unstable

phases are marked by 1○and 2○, respectively, in Fig. 2. While the temperature increases
with zhfor the small-unstable black hole phase, it falls with zhfor the large-stable black
hole phase (cyan line). The appearance of the small-unstable phase can also be analyti-
cally noticed from Eq. (3.7). Observe that for µe= 0, the second term vanishes, and only
the first term contributes to the temperature, and this first term increases with zhfor
large zh. Interestingly, unlike the uncharged BTZ black hole, the uncharged hairy black
hole phases exist only above a certain minimum temperature Tmin, i.e., below Tmin, the
hairy black hole phases cease to exist and leaving the thermal-AdS solution as the only
remaining feasible phase. This is true for all finite values of a. Importantly, as it generally
happens, the occurrence of multivaluedness of the temperature also indicates a possible
phase transition in the hairy context.
To further investigate the global thermodynamic stabilities of the above-discussed
hairy black hole phases, we need to study their free energy behaviour. The Gibbs free
energy Gat a fixed potential in differential form is related to the black hole entropy as
dG=−SBHdT , (3.9)
which can be used to compute the free energy difference between the black hole and
thermal-AdS phases,

In Fig. 3, the Gibbs free energy of the hairy black hole phases is shown.2The colour
pattern used here is identical to Fig. 2. We observe that for all finite values of a, there
appears a transition temperature THPat which the Gibbs free energy changes its sign. It
suggests the occurrence of a well-known Hawking/Page type phase transition between an
uncharged large-stable hairy black hole phase and the thermal-AdS phase at THP. Ac-
cordingly, below THPthermal-AdS is thermodynamically favoured, whereas above THP
large hairy black hole is thermodynamically favoured. Also, the free energy of the small-
unstable black hole phase is always higher than the large-stable black hole phase, indicat-

The above thermodynamic structure of the hairy black hole gets more interesting as
the chemical potential is turned on. Depending upon the relative magnitudes of µeand
a, not only the hairy black hole can become extremal, but it can also exist in one or two
phases. This is illustrated in Fig. 4. Here, we have presented the results for a particular
value of a= 0.2; however, analogous results appear for other values of aas well. For
small µe, like in the µe= 0 case, there again appear two black hole phases above Tmin,
with the large black hole phase (indicated by 1○) being thermodynamically more favoured
and stable compared to the small black hole phase (indicated by 2○) at all temperatures
T > T min. Therefore, for small µe, there again occurs a Hawking/Page phase transition
between the large hairy black hole and thermal-AdS phases. This is illustrated in Fig. 5,
where one can clearly observe a sign change in the Gibbs free energy as the temperature
is varied. However, for large µe, this phase transition ceases to exit. For large µe, there
exists only one stable black hole phase which becomes extremal at some horizon radius
zext
h(cyan line), and the free energy of this black hole phase is always smaller than the
thermal-AdS. This result is completely analogous to the charged BTZ black hole. For the
non-hairy charged BTZ black hole (with Coulomb-like potential), the extremal horizon
radius can be found from Eq. (3.8). It occurs at zext
h= 4(2)1/6/µe. Whereas for the
hairy black hole case, the magnitude of this zext
hincreases with a. These results further
imply that irrespective of the temperature, at least one black hole phase always exists
and remains stable for the charged case when µeis relatively large. Our whole analysis,
therefore, suggests that for a fixed value of a, there exists a critical chemical potential
µc
ebelow which the Hawking/Page phase transition between the thermal-AdS and hairy
black hole phases takes place, whereas no such phase transition appears above µc
e.
We further investigate the dependence of THPonaandµe. Figs. 6 and 7 depict the
overall dependence of THPon these variables. Our finding shows that when aincreases,
THPshows a monotonically rising tendency. Specifically, the transition temperature rises
with awhile falling with µe. Although THPrises with afor every µe, it should be noted
that, unlike the µe= 0 case, the slope of the avsTHPline is not constant for finite µe.
Our results, therefore, suggest that the possibility of Hawking/Page phase transition in
13the hairy context increases for large aand small µevalues. It also implies that for large
chemical potential, one needs a higher value of ato observe the Hawking/Page phase
transition. This, in turn, implies the existence of critical hairy parameter acbelow which
no Hawking/Page phase transition takes place in the fixed µegrand-canonical ensemble.

Having discussed the thermodynamic structure of the hairy black hole in the grand-
canonical ensemble, we now move on to discuss it in the canonical ensemble. We find
that the thermodynamic results in the canonical ensemble are quite similar to the grand-
canonical ensemble. The case qe= 0 = µeis already discussed above. The results for
14finite qeare shown in Figs. 8 and 9. In the canonical ensemble as well, depending upon
the magnitude of a, there appear two black hole phases for small qe, whereas only one
black hole phase appears for large qe. While the temperature increases with zhfor the
unstable black hole phase, it falls with zhfor the stable black hole phase. The temperature
expression shows that for qe̸= 0 and very small values of a, there is only one stable branch
of the black hole, and it becomes extremal at some horizon radius zext
h(orange and cyan
lines). These findings also suggest that, for the fixed charged case, at least one stable
black hole branch always exists when ais relatively small. While keeping qefixed, the
temperature starts to rise with zhfor large avalues. Notably, the hairy black hole phases
are restricted to temperatures over a certain threshold Tmin, in contrast to the BTZ black
hole. This suggests the possibility of Hawking/Page transition between large hairy black
hole phase and thermal-AdS as aincreases in the canonical ensemble as well. This is
indeed the case, as can be explicitly observed from the free energy behavior shown in
Fig. 9. The Helmholtz free energy difference between the black hole and thermal-AdS
phases can be computed from the analogous differential first law

The transition temperature THPagain depends nontrivially on aandqe. Figs. 10 and
11 show the full illustration of this dependency. Our analysis shows that when achanges,
THPshows a monotonically rising tendency. Specifically, the transition temperature rises
with awhile falling with qe. Although THPrises with afor every qe, it should be noted
that, unlike the situation where qe= 0, the slope of the avsTHPline is not constant
forqe̸= 0. Overall, our analysis suggests that there exists a critical value acof the hairy
parameter in the fixed charge ensemble as well. The charged hairy black hole undergoes
the Hawking/Page phase transition above this critical value, while below ac, no such phase
transition takes place.3
3Here we like to emphasize that the Helmholtz free energy difference can not be computed from Eq. (3.11)
15Let us emphasize that the obtained hairy black holes are also locally stable. The local
stability corresponds to the response of the equilibrium system under a small fluctuation
in thermodynamical variables and is established by the positivity of the specific heat at
a constant chemical potential Cµe=T(∂SBH/∂T)|µeor charge Cqe=T(∂SBH/∂T)|qe
in the grand-canonical and canonical ensembles, respectively. Since SBH∝z−1
h, it is
straightforward to see from Figs. 2 and 8 that the slope of the SBH−Tplane is always
positive in the thermodynamically favoured hairy black hole phase 1○. Accordingly, Cµe>
0 and Cqe>0 in the favoured hairy black hole phase, indicating the local stability of hairy
black holes. Similarly, CµeandCqeare negative in the thermodynamically disfavored hairy
black hole phase 2○.

In this section, we investigate the geometrical and thermodynamical structure of the
charged hairy black hole solutions for the exponential coupling function f(ϕ) =eϕ. The
form of A(z) =−a2z2is the same as in the previous section. Therefore, the solution of
the scalar field will remain the same. This indicates that the scalar field remains regular,
finite, and well-behaved everywhere outside the horizon for this coupling as well. From
the equation (2.6), we get gauge field solution

for nonhairy black holes corresponding to a→0. This is because the integrand in Eq. (3.11) contains z3

logzhterms which give diverging contributions to the free energy difference in the upper limit of integration.
For this reason, here as well as in the subsequent sections, we discuss thermodynamic results only for the hairy
case in the canonical ensemble.
16Notice that in the limit a→0,Bt(z) again reduces to the Coulomb-like potential. In a

which again, under the limit a→0, reduces to the standard charged BTZ black hole
like expressions with Coulomb-like potential. In Fig. 12, the behavior of g(z) and the
Kretschmann scalar RµνρσRµνρσis illustrated. The spacetime exhibits a horizon at zh
and does not contain any additional singularity, thereby emphasizing the well-behaved na-
ture of the obtained hairy solution. The Ricci scalar is similarly finite and well-behaved
everywhere outside the horizon. The hair parameter again non-trivially modifies the
Kretschmann and Ricci scalars, implying that the spacetime curvature depends non-
trivially on the hairy parameter and is no longer a constant. Similarly, the potential
asymptotes to a constant value V(z)|z→0= 2Λ at the AdS boundary and is bounded
from above.

which also reduces to Eq. (3.8) in the limit a→0 and to the uncharged BTZ expression
in the limit a→0 and qe→0.
Let us again first discuss the black hole thermodynamics in the grand-canonical en-
semble. The thermodynamic structure of the hairy black hole with f(ϕ) =eϕcoupling
remains quite similar to the f(ϕ) = 1 coupling for the fixed chemical potential ensemble.
Notice that for µe= 0, the Einstein-power Maxwell-scalar gravity action becomes the
same for both f(ϕ) = 1 and f(ϕ) =eϕcouplings, which in turn produces identical ther-
modynamic structure for both couplings for µe= 0. Consequently, for f(ϕ) =eϕcoupling
as well, there exists a thermodynamically stable hairy black hole phase which undergoes
a phase transition to thermal-AdS phase as the temperature is lowered, i.e., the Hawk-
ing/page phase transition continues to exist, with the thermal-AdS phase dominating the
structure at lower temperatures whereas a large stable hairy black hole phase dominates
the phase structure at higher temperatures. For µe= 0, the phase diagram is essentially
identical to Fig. 3.
The thermodynamic structure with f(ϕ) =eϕcoupling remains quite similar to the
f(ϕ) = 1 coupling for the finite chemical potential as well. The results are shown in
Figs. 13 and 14. Here again, there exists a critical chemical potential µc
ebelow which the
Hawking/Page phase transition between the thermal-AdS and hairy black hole phases
take place, whereas no such phase transition appears above µc
e. In particular, for µe< µc
e,
two black hole branches appear which exist only above a certain minimum temperature,
whereas, for µe> µc
e, only one black hole branch appears which becomes extremal and
remain thermodynamically stable at all temperatures. The magnitudes of µc

Hawking/Page phase transition THPagain depend nontrivially on the hair parameter a.
This dependence is shown in Figs. 15 and 16. The overall behaviour of THPconcerning a

We have similarly analyzed the thermodynamic structure in the canonical ensemble.
The temperature and free energy profiles are shown in Figs. 17 and 18. Again, for small
values of qe, two hairy black hole phases appear, with the large stable hairy black hole
phase undergoing phase transition to the thermal-AdS phase as the temperature is low-
ered. Whereas, for relatively large values of qe, only one stable hairy black hole phase
appears which becomes extremal at a certain horizon radius. These results again suggest

195 Hairy Black hole solution with Coupling f(ϕ) =eϕ2/2
Now we consider the coupling function f(ϕ) =eϕ2/2. Such a coupling function has been
thoroughly considered in the hairy black hole context in recent years, see for instance
[95]. Therefore, it is instructive to analyse such coupling functions here as well. With
f(ϕ) =eϕ2/2coupling, most of our results for the hairy black hole solution remain the
same as in the case of previous coupling f(ϕ) =eϕ. We will, therefore, be brief here. Since
the form factor is the same, the solution for the scalar field will remain the same. This
implies that the scalar field continues to be regular, finite, and well-behaved everywhere
in the exterior horizon region for this exponential coupling function as well. The solution
of the gauge field is now given by

The behaviour of g(z) and the Kretschmann scalar for the coupling f(ϕ) =eϕ2/2
is shown in Fig. 21. The hairy black hole solution is again regular and well-behaved
20everywhere outside the horizon. The curvature is finite everywhere outside the horizon
and the singularity appears only inside the horizon. The potential similarly asymptotes
to a constant value V(z)|z→0= 2Λ at the AdS boundary and is bounded from above.
These results firmly establish the well-behaved geometric nature of the hairy black hole
with f(ϕ) =eϕ2/2coupling as well.

The thermodynamic structure of the hairy black hole in the grand-canonical ensemble
is shown in Figs. 22 and 23. Since for µe= 0, the Einstein-power Maxwell-scalar gravity
action becomes identical for all f(ϕ), it ensures identical thermodynamic structure for
hairy black holes at µe= 0 for all f(ϕ). For f(ϕ) =eϕ2/2and for small chemical potential,
there exists a thermodynamically stable hairy black hole phase which undergoes a phase
transition to thermal-AdS phase as the temperature is lowered, i.e., the Hawking/page
phase transition continues to exist, with the thermal-AdS phase dominating the structure
at lower temperatures. In contrast, a large stable hairy black hole phase dominates
the phase structure at higher temperatures. Similarly, there exists a critical chemical
potential µc
eabove which the Hawking/Page phase transition ceases to exist. Therefore,
here again for µe< µc
e, two black hole branches appear which exist only above a certain
minimum temperature, whereas, for µe> µc
e, only one black hole branch appears which
can become extremal and remain thermodynamically stable at all temperatures. The
thermodynamically favoured black holes are also thermodynamically stable as they have
positive specific heat. The magnitudes of µc
eand the Hawking/Page phase transition THP
again depend nontrivially on the hair parameter a. This dependence is shown in Figs. 24
and 25.
The thermodynamic results in the canonical ensemble are shown in Figs. 26 and 27.

We end this section by emphasizing that with f(ϕ) =eϕ2/2coupling, the thermody-
namic phase diagram of the hairy black hole, both in the canonical and grand-canonical
ensemble, remains quite similar to the f(ϕ) = 1 and f(ϕ) =eϕcases. Our investigation,
therefore, indicates some type of universality in the thermodynamic phase structure of
the hairy black hole with Coulomb-like potential for different coupling functions. Partic-

dependent, below which there appears first-order phase transition between the large hairy
black hole and thermal-AdS phases, whereas above these critical points, no such phase
transition exits. We analyzed some other forms of A(z) as well and found similar universal
results in the thermodynamic phase structure of hairy black holes.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we have constructed a new family of three-dimensional hairy-charged black
hole solutions from the Einstein-power Maxwell-scalar action. The gauge field solution in
particular, being devoid of logarithmic singularity, is everywhere well-behaved and reduces
to the usual inverse power law behavior for the non-hairy case, thereby downplaying
the usual issues faced in Maxwell electrodynamic in three dimensions. The constructed
solutions were based on two functions: the coupling function f(ϕ) and the form factor
A(z). We specifically analysed the solutions for three interesting and physically motivated
forms of the coupling function: (i) f(ϕ) = 1, (ii) f(ϕ) =eϕ, and lastly (iii) f(ϕ) =eϕ2/2,
along with the simple form of A(z) =−a2z2. The parameter aregulates the strength
of the scalar hair, and in the limit a→0, the solution always reduces to the standard
non-hairy BTZ black hole with a Coulomb-like potential. We have observed that in each
of the solutions: (i) the scalar hair is found to be regular everywhere outside the horizon
and goes to zero at the asymptotic AdS boundary, (ii) the Kretschmann and Ricci scalars
are always finite and well-behaved outside the horizon, and diverge only at the centre of
the black hole, and (iii) the potential is found to be bounded from above from its UV
boundary value. These results indicate the smooth and desirable nature of the constructed
hairy black holes for these different coupling functions.
Next, we analysed the thermodynamic properties of the hairy black hole solutions in
canonical and grand-canonical ensembles and found some universal and intriguing results.
For each of the considered coupling functions, a critical value of the hairy parameter ac
appeared above which the black hole exhibited the Hawking/Page phase transition to
the thermal-AdS phase as the temperature is lowered, whereas below this acno phase
23transition existed. This result should be contrasted with the usual uncharged BTZ black
hole case, where no such phase transition appeared. This suggests that the addition of a
scalar hair makes the three-dimensional phase structure much richer. Additionally, it is
observed that the associated transition temperature also increases monotonically with a.
We similarly analysed the hairy thermodynamic structure for finite values of qeandµe
in the canonical and grand-canonical ensembles and found that the Hawking/Page phase
transition continues to persist for small values of qeandµe, whereas for large values of
µeandqeno such phase transition occurs. These results indicate the existence of critical
values qc
eandµc
e(which are f(ϕ) dependent) at which the Hawking/Page phase transition
line stops. The transition temperature was further found to be decreasing monotonically
with qeandµe. Interestingly, this thermodynamic pattern matches quite well with the
charged RN-AdS black holes in four and higher dimensions. This is intriguing because
while BTZ black holes and their counterparts in higher dimensions share a number of
geometric characteristics, their thermodynamic structures are very different. We also
found that the specific heat is always positive in the thermodynamically favoured hairy
black hole phase, hence establishing the local stability of the hairy black holes.
This work might be extended in many directions. It would be interesting to extend
this work by finding its axisymmetric counterpart. We anticipate that similar to the BTZ
black hole, the charged hairy black hole thermodynamic structure may be significantly
altered by the rotational parameter. It is also important to check the dynamical stability
of the constructed hairy black hole under various perturbations. Our preliminary analysis
in this direction leads us to believe that these hairy black holes are dynamically stable
under scalar field perturbations. Work in these directions is in progress.
