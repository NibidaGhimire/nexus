ABSTRACT
V907 Scorpii is a unique triple system in which the inner binary compone nt has been reported to
switch on and oﬀ eclipses several times in modern history. In spite of its peculiarity, observational
data on this system are surprisingly scarce. Here we make use of th e recent TESS observations, as
well as our own photometric and spectroscopic data, to expand th e overall dataset and study the
V907 Sco system in more detail. Our analysis provides both new and imp roved values for several
of its fundamental parameters: (i) masses of the stars in the eclip sing binary are 2 .74±0.02 M⊙
and 2.56±0.02 M⊙; and (ii) the third component is a solar-type star with mass 1 .06+0.11
−0.10M⊙(90%
C.L.), orbiting the binary on an elongated orbit with an eccentricity of 0.47±0.02 and a period of
142.01±0.05 days. The intermittent intervals of time when eclipses of the inner binary are switched
on and oﬀ is caused by a mutual 26 .2+2.6
−2.2degree inclination of the inner- and outer-orbit planes, and a
favourableinclination ofabout 71◦of the total angularmomentum of the system. The nodal precess ion
period is Pν= 63.5+3.3
−2.6yr. The inner binary will remain eclipsing for another ≃26 years, oﬀering an
opportunity to signiﬁcantly improve parameters of the model. This is especially true during the next
decade when the inner orbit inclination will increase to nearly 90◦. Further spectroscopic observations
are also desirable, as they can help to improve constraints on the sy stem’s orbital architecture and its
physical parameters.

1.INTRODUCTION
Space-borne observations from the Kepler and Tran-
siting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) missions have
assisted with the discover and study a particularly in-
teresting class of compact hierarchical triples (CHTs).
These stellar systems are characterized by a small-
enough ratio of the outer and inner orbital periods. A
plethora of dynamical eﬀects at various timescales can
be detected with accurate photometric measurements
for CHTs, and if properly interpreted with theoreti-
cal modeling, they may bring interesting constraints on
many physical parameters of the system. An excellent

(2022).
Few archetype CHT systems have been known even
before the above-mentioned revolution. In these cases,
though, only the secular perturbations related to nodal
and pericenter precession were typically detected. The
short periods of these eﬀects, sometimes even only a few
decades, made them belong to the CHT class (see, e.g.,
Juryˇ sek et al. 2018 , for a review).
V907 Sco is a particularly interesting member of this
class of objects. While occasionally observed in the sec-
ond half of the 20th century, and ﬁrst cryptically re-
ported to be an eclipsing binary by Strohmeier et al.
(1964), a truly comprehensive study of V907 Sco was
presentedby Lacy et al. (1999). Weencouragetheinter-
ested reader to learn about the sometimes tangled his-2 Zasche et al.
toryoftheV907Scoanalysisfromthe accumulatedpho-
tometric data in this reference (principally Sec. 1). Here
we only mention that Lacy et al. (1999) were the ﬁrst to
fully understand the background story of V907 Sco by
proposing that it is in fact a triple in which the previ-
ously known binary is accompanied by a third star in
a suﬃciently close orbit. This was necessary to explain
the surprisinglyshortchangingperiodsduringwhichthe
binary ceased to be eclipsing. Unfortunately Lacy et al.
(1999) could not continue to collect accurate photome-
try of the eclipsing component, since it was not eclipsing
during the period of their work. Their important con-
tribution to the observational evidence about V907 Sco
thus consisted in taking the ﬁrst series of the spec-
troscopic data. While useful in several aspects (e.g.,
conﬁrming precisely the period of the eclipsing binary,
determining the semiamplitudes of the radial velocity
curves, and noting the narrowness of the spectral lines),
Lacy et al. (1999) wereunlucky by havingavailable only
asparsesetofspectraspreadoveranintervalof11years.
Their analysis was therefore ill-suited for such a fast-
evolving system and led to a few mistakes. First, they
attempted to determine masses of the stars in the in-
ner binary but chose an incorrect orbital inclination at
the reference epoch of their observations. As a result,
their reported masses were slightly incorrect (Sec. 2).
More importantly though, the sparsity of their data led
them to determine basic parameters of the outer orbit,
the periodandorbitaleccentricity, incorrectly(seeagain
Sec.2). To their credit, however, we ﬁnally note that
Lacy et al. (1999) also considered the possibility that
V907 Sco belongs to the open cluster M7. Compar-
ing the estimated distance to both M7 and V907 Sco,
though the latter arguably rather approximate at that
moment, they rightly rejected the association. Their
conclusionwasrecentlyconﬁrmedwithastrometricmea-
surements from Gaia DR3 showing that V907 Sco has a
parallax of 2 .279±0.033mas ( Gaia Collaboration et al.
2022). This translates to a distance of 439 ±6 pc, well
beyond that of M7.
The rather rough and partially incorrect analysis of
Lacy et al. (1999) let these authors to predict that the
eclipses of V907 Sco will start again in 2030 ±5 in their
concluding Section 4. However, Borkovits (2022) noted
that the recent observations of TESS have already re-
vealed an onset of V907 Sco eclipses in the Sector 13
data (in mid 2019), and conﬁrmed their expected trend
towards deeper eclipses in the Sector 39 data (in mid
2021). Clearly, the situation demands a new analysis
of V907 Sco, since the recent emergence of its eclips-
ing state alone proves that some assumptions and/or
data treatment in Lacy et al. (1999) have not been cor-rect. Thisis the primarypurposeofthis work. However,
realizing that past data (especially the pre-TESS pho-
tometry) could be improvedupon, wealsoaimto extend
the empirical data set on this unusual triple system with
new observations.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2we de-
scribe photometric and spectroscopic observationsavail-
able to us, including archival, previously published, and
new data we obtained in the 2022season. Realizing that
several orbital parameters are evolving quickly, we split
the analysisinto twosteps. First, still in Sec. 2, we focus
on the bulk of the 2021-2022 data. They conveniently
cover a period slightly longer than the outer orbit pe-
riod, allowing us to properly characterize it, but short
enough that the changes of the orbital parameters are
minimal. We can thus use plain Keplerian orbits for
the data analysis here. This allows us to determine or-
bital and physical parameters of the inner binary in the
V907 Sco system (included the masses and radii of the
stars). With this information available, we can thus use
the archival photometry and derive inclination changes
of the eclipsing binary over more than a century. In
Sec.3we develop a model accounting for mutual grav-
itational interactions of all three stars in the system to
describe the observed variations of the orbital elements
over long-term period (many cycles of the outer orbit).
Confrontationwiththedataallowsustodeterminesome
parameters of the third star (including its mass and tilt
of its orbital plane with respect to the orbital plane of
the inner binary). Finally, in Sec. 4, we outline future
prospects to study V907 Sco in even more detail.
2.OBSERVATIONS AND SHORT-TERM ANALYSIS
Both photometric and spectroscopic observations are
available for V907 Sco. The photometry falls into the
following three categories: (i) archival data sparsely
spanning more than a century, some of which have also
been mentioned by Lacy et al. (1999), (ii) the above-
mentioned TESS observations, and (iii) our new data
from the 2022 season. As for the spectroscopy, we con-
ducted an intensive observing campaign in 2022, know-
ing how quickly the V907 Sco system evolves. Such data
have the advantage of minimizing long-term evolution-
ary eﬀects in spectra. There are also radial velocity
measurementspublished by Lacy et al. (1999) (their Ta-
ble 3). However, they are spread over a time interval of
nearly11years,and thustheiranalysisstronglydepends
on the ability to consistently include the evolutionary
model of the whole system. For that reason, we do not
considerthem here, but savetheir analysisforthe future
work.

In what follows, we describe each photometric data
set, in order of decreasing precision.
TESS photometry.– We searched all TESS sectors for
ﬁeld-of-views containing V907 Sco and found thatthe object was observed twice, in Sectors 13 and 39
(V907 Sco = TIC 261030551; see also Borkovits 2022 ).
Each of them represents about 27 day long period of
continuous data, with an approximately day-long data
downlink gap in the middle. Target photometry was ex-
tracted using the publicly available lightkurve pack-
age (e.g., Lightkurve Collaboration et al. 2018 ). Coin-
cidentally, and of high value to this study, Sector 13 ob-
servations began at the onset of the eclipses, as the light
curve shows only a very shallow signal/dip at the pri-
mary eclipse phase. The exposure cadence was about 30
minutes. The Sector 39 data are superior in their qual-
ity and value for our analysis. Not only do they have a
more rapid cadence (10 minutes), but they were taken
at the moment when the stars in the inner binary of
V907 Sco exhibited suﬃciently deep eclipses (about 0.06
mag in the case of the primary eclipse) for a thorough
analysis. With the expected millimagnitude-level accu-
racy of the TESS photometry (e.g., Ricker et al. 2015 ),
the Sector 39 data are by far the most precise photom-
etry we possess on the V907 Sco system. Consequently,
they provide important constraints on fundamental or-
bital and physical parameters of the inner binary. Fig-
ure1shows the TESS light curves from both sectors,
phase-folded on the best-ﬁtting mean period P1of the
binary. We note that our deﬁnition of the zero phase is
shifted by half an orbital period compared to the deﬁni-
tion ofLacy et al. (1999). This is because we prefer to
associate the zero phase with the deeper eclipse, when
the smaller (less massive) star in the binary eclipses the
larger (heavier) star.
We used the well-tested software package
PHOEBE (Prˇ sa & Zwitter 2005 ), based on the
Wilson & Devinney (1971) code, to obtain fundamental
parameters of the inner binary system using (i) TESS
Sector 39 photometric data, and (ii) our new spectro-
scopic data described in Sec. 2.2. Ideally, both datasets
should have been taken at the same epoch, but they
were not. Luckily, the one year diﬀerence between
them is short. Figure 6shows that the binary inclina-
tioni1changed by only ≃1◦from 2021 to 2022, and
this makes the semiamplitudes of the radial velocities
change by about 0 .3%. This is a negligible change in
our solution. Our modeling required only minimum
assumptions, such as rotational synchronicity of the
stars in the binary ( Fi= 1), while other parameters
were left adjusted. This concerns not only the primary
ones, such as stellar masses and radii, but also more
subtle ones, such as the gravity brightening or albedo.
The latter primarily inﬂuences the ellipsoidal modu-
lation of the photometric signal outside the eclipses
(Fig.1). The results are summarized in Table 1. The4 Zasche et al.

the center of the ﬁrst primary eclipse in the TESS

masses, 2 .56 M⊙and 2.74 M⊙, are about 8% larger
than previously suggested by Lacy et al. (1999). This
is because these authors assumed an inaccurate value
of the inclination i1of the binary orbital plane at the
eﬀective epoch of their spectroscopic observations. The
corresponding radii are 2 .53 R⊙and 2.68 R⊙, consistent
with the values expected for the B9V and B8V main
sequence stars. The contribution of the third light in
the TESS passband is about 6%, and the binary has a
small, but well detectable, orbital eccentricity of about
0.008. Both values are found to be consistent with our
modeling discussed below (see Sec. 4).
FRAM photometry.– The most recent data, taken be-
tween April and September 2022, had the purpose of
conﬁrming the trend of the eclipse depth increase (and
thus the inclination of the binary orbital plane). Theywere obtained with the F/(Ph)otometric Robotic At-
mospheric Monitor (FRAM) 30 cm telescope at Pierre
Auger Observatory, Argentina (e.g., Aab et al. 2021 ).
This is an Orion ODK 300/2040mm system equipped
with the CCD camera MII G4-16000; standard reduc-
tion routines using dark frames and ﬂat ﬁelds were used.
The small aperture of the instrument results in the
FRAM photometry having less precision than the TESS
photometry; atypicaluncertaintyin anindividualframe
is≃0.01 magnitude. However, given the fact that the
current eclipse depth is already about ten times larger,
the FRAM data are still very useful (see the top curve
on Fig.2and Fig. 10). We obtained observations at
four epochs in 2022, clearly demonstrating the expected
progression towards deeper eclipses. Importantly, when
this trend is mapped to the increasing inclination of the
binary orbital plane (Table 2), the time evolution is not
linear. Indeed, in Sec. 3.4we ﬁnd reasons for this non-
linearity in the dynamical model.
Archival photometry.– In addition to our recent photo-
metric data, we also utilized archival resources. Obvi-
ously, this is motivated by the reported intermissions in
V907 Sco eclipses ( Lacy et al. 1999 ), and thus we seek
the ability to describe them. We used data from: (i)
the Archives of Photographic PLates for Astronomical
USE (APPLAUSE) project of digitalizing the old pho-
tographic plates available online1(Groote et al. 2014 ),
and (ii) the Digital Access to a Sky Century at Harvard
(DASCH) database of photographic plates from Har-
vard observatory2(Tang et al. 2013 ). Given the fact
that DASCH plates cover an interval of several decades,
wecouldevenparsethem intoseveralindependent inter-
vals in between 1900 and 1920. In spite of their rather
poor quality (see the bottom curves on Fig. 2), these
data are still very useful as they approximately tell us
trends in the inclination variations over a long time-
span. Obviously, we downscale the weight of these data
by assigning large uncertainty to the derived inclination
values (Table 2).
Despiteoureﬀorts, weunfortunatelydidnotﬁndmore
photometric datasets from existing survey programs
that would provide useful information about V907 Sco.
An example is ASAS-sn in 2022, in which observations
in the V907 Sco ﬁeld are subject to a spurious instru-
mental scatter of about 1.5 mag.

Compilation of the inclination values at diﬀerent
epochs.– Having calibrated the physical parameters of
stars in the inner binary from the TESS photometry,
we can now ﬁx them and use other photometric data
to determine only the inclination of the eclipsing binary
orbital plane at their epoch. For this task we used thePHOEBE code as above. Note also that ephemerides
forthe eclipsesaredetermined accuratelyenoughforour
purpose: a fractional uncertainty of ∆ P1/P1≃3×10−6
expands to a ≃0.03 phase uncertainty after a century-
long interval (i.e., roughly representing 104cycles of
the binary). This is due to the extreme accuracy of
the TESS photometry. Nevertheless, we adjusted the
epoch of the primary minimum individually in each of
the datasets, such that the ﬁt to the model is optimized.
As expected, this adjustment turned out to be minimal.
The results are summarized in Table 2for both the
less accurate archival data and the much more precise
modern data. From the TESS Sector 13 the value was
only roughly estimated, while for the TESS Sector 39
the data were split evenly into two parts (roughly two
weekseach), andtheinclinationwasdeterminedforeach
independently. The two i1values are indeed statistically
diﬀerent and match well the expected trend (Sec. 3.4).
We are aware of the fact that the TESS data suﬀer from
light contamination from nearby sources and its level
maychangebetweendiﬀerentsectors,orevenduringone
sector ofdata. Due to strongcorrelationbetween the in-
clination and additional stray light this may play some
role. However, the diﬀerence would be only very small,
and the principal results of the analysis when using one6 Zasche et al.

obtained using the CHIRON echelle high-resolution
spectrograph(R ≃28000)mountedona1 .5mSMARTS
telescope at CTIO observatory located on Cerro Tololo,
Chile (e.g., Tokovinin et al. 2013 ). Altogether, we have
66 spectra taken in between March and October 2022.
Typical exposure times were 480 s, and the usable spec-
tral range covered a wavelength range of 450 to 890 nm.96609680970097209740976097809800982098409860−4 −2 0 2 4−20−15−10−50510

ing thereSPEFO 2 package3(Harmanec et al. 2020 ).
The resulting values at each epoch observed are listed
in supplementary materials (Table A1). For most of the
spectra, we were able to identify a pair of lines that be-
long to the two stars in the inner binary of V907 Sco
(corresponding mainly to Fe and Si; see Fig. 3for two
examples at diﬀerent phases of the binary motion). Un-
fortunately, we could not identify spectral lines of the
third star in the system (see also Lacy et al. 1999 ). This
non-detection can be explained bya lowluminosity (and
thusmass)comparedtothestarsintheinnerbinary. We
estimate a ≃5 magnitude diﬀerence between the third
star and the binary, or a few percent contribution to
the total luminosity of the system at maximum. Given
the masses derived in Table 1for the components in the
binary, we estimate an upper mass limit on the third
star of≃1.05 M⊙. This nicely matches the results in
Sec.3.4, where we infer the third component mass from
its dynamical eﬀects on the binary.
As mentioned in the previous Section, we used the
codePHOEBE to analyse simultaneously the TESS-
Sector 39 photometry and our derived radial velocities
in order to solve for the orbital and physical param-
eters of the eclipsing binary (i.e., all signal at the P1
period). This resulted in the values presented in Ta-
ble1and the velocity curve ﬁts shown in Fig. 4. The
3https://astro.troja.mﬀ.cuni.cz/projects/respefo/7
data are matched by the model quite well. Next we
analysed the residual signal in the measured radial ve-
locities and expected to ﬁnd the ≃99 day period of the
outer orbit reported by Lacy et al. (1999). To our sur-
prise, we obtained something else (see Fig. 5). When
ﬁtting a Keplerian orbit to the velocity residuals, we
ﬁnd a long period of P2≃142 days with a signiﬁcant
eccentricity of e2≃0.47. Table 3presents the resulting
parameters. The model ﬁt is rather good, with the ﬁ-
nal residuals having a dispersion of only 0 .64 km s−1(at
thelevelofthe radialvelocitymeasurementuncertainty)
and no further signals being detectable (see Supplemen-
tary materials, Table A1). We unfortunately lack data
near the minimum and maximum of the radial velocity
curve for the outer orbit (this happened partly due to
bad weather and partly due to overload of the telescope
byother projects). This leavesus with parameteruncer-
tainties in Table 3slightly larger than we would wished.
As an example, the minimum mass of the third compo-
nent, as derived from the mass function, ranges between
0.95 M⊙and 1.09 M⊙. We only note that this value
is satisfactorily compatible both (i) with the maximum
third component mass from the absence of its spectro-
scopic evidence and the third light contribution, and
(ii) also with the solution based on photometric data in
Sec.3.4.
Finally, we note that the large value of the eccentric-
ity of the outer orbit is still comfortably within stabil-
ity limits. Assuming stellar masses in the eclipsing bi-
nary derived above, and m2≃1 M⊙(Sec.3.4), we ﬁnd
that the system is stable up to estab
2≃0.63 accord-
ing to the criteria in Eggleton & Kiseleva (1995) and
Mardling & Aarseth (2001).
3.LONG-TERM EVOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM
In this section, we analyse the observational results
of the V907 Sco system collected above and summa-
rized in Table 2using a simple, but adequately accu-
rate model. This allows us to describe changes in the
system’s architecture and its parameters, such as or-
bital inclinations of both inner and outer orbits, over a
timescale of decades. Before discussing the results, we
review the basic aspects of our theoretical approach and
relevant variables. Additional details can be found in

sical series of papers by Soderhjelm (1975,1982,1984).
We ﬁnd it useful to start with a simple analytic secular
modelinSec. 3.1. Eﬀectswithlongperiod P2arenotde-
scribed by this part, but its strength stems from analyt-
icity, which eﬀectively helps us pre-constrain the model
parameters. Next, in Sec. 3.2, we also include the long-period eﬀects using a computationally more demanding
numerical model.
3.1.Simple analytical model for the secular part
We ﬁrst introduce notation and important parame-
ters used throughout this section: (i) m1aandm1bare
masses of the two stars in the eclipsing binary (inner
orbit), deﬁning their total and reduced masses simply
asM1=m1a+m1bandµ1=m1am1b/M1, (ii)m2is
the mass of the third star in the system (constituting
the outer orbit with respect to the barycenter of the in-
ner orbit), and the total mass is M2=M1+m2. We
denote also the mean orbital periods P1andP2of the
inner and outer orbits, or alternatively also the corre-
sponding mean motions n1= 2π/P1andn2= 2π/P2.
Finally, we assume the inner orbit is circular ( e1= 0),
and the outer orbit may have an arbitrary eccentricity
e2, deﬁning also a convenient parameter η2=/radicalbig
1−e2
2.
The principal variables of interest are the orbital an-
gular momenta L1andL2of the inner and outer or-
bits, which secularly change due to gravitational inter-
actions in the system. When the latter is restricted to
the quadrupole coupling, justiﬁable in the V907Sco sys-
tem for which the mass ratio qof the stars in the inner
system hasbeen found closeto unity, (i) the angularmo-
mentum magnitudes L1andL2are secularly conserved,
and (ii) the unit vectors l1andl2, deﬁning orientationof
the respective angular momenta in space, steadily pre-
cess about the conserved total angular momentum of
the triple L=Ll=L1+L2(here we neglect small
contributions of the rotational angular momenta of the
three stars, again justiﬁable for the V907 Sco system,
where the narrow spectral lines of the components in
the eclipsing system imply their slow rotation). Addi-
tionally, as the angular momentum vectors of the inner
and outer system roll on the respective cones about L,
their mutual conﬁguration is ﬁxed such that their mu-
tual angle Jdeﬁned by cos J=l1·l2(also depicting the
angle between the orbital planes of the inner and outer
orbits), remains secularly constant.
Itshouldberecalledthatwithinthepoint-mass,three-
bodyproblemadoptedhere, thesimplesolutionoutlined
above holds when J≤40◦orJ≥140◦. In between
these values a more complicated, Kozai-Lidov regime
occurs (e.g., Soderhjelm 1982 ;Farago & Laskar 2010 ).
Luckily, this complication is of no concern for V907 Sco.
First, we show below that the observations require con-
ﬁguration for which Jis restricted to a narrow range of
values about ≃26.2◦(Sec.3.4). Second, the long-term
stable triples often rearrange such that the Kozai-Lidov
regime is eﬀectively eliminated by mutual (tidal) inter-
action of the stars in the inner orbit (e.g., Soderhjelm8 Zasche et al.
1984); this even allows systems with J= 90◦to exist,
theAlgolcaserepresentingthearchetypememberofthis
class (e.g., Baron et al. 2012 ).

state of the inner and outer angular momenta reads sim-

and similarly for l2(t) (recall lis the unit vector of
the conserved total angular momentum of the system).
Here,ˆl1is the unit vector of the inner orbit angular
momentum at some arbitrary reference time T0(i.e.,
ˆl1=l1(T0)), andα=ν(t−T0), where νis the fun-
damental precession frequency. Some authors are satis-
ﬁed with νas a free, solved-for parameter, but the an-
alytical theory oﬀers an important step further, namely
to interpret νin terms of more fundamental parame-
ters such as Jand masses of stars in the triple system.
Remaining still on the grounds of the quadrupole cou-
pling approximation, we have (e.g., Soderhjelm 1975 ;

istheratiooftheinnerandouterorbitangularmomenta
(i.e.,γ=L1/L2). Typical triple systems have γ≪1,
as the outer orbit carries much larger share of the sys-
tem’s angular momentum. However, V907 Sco belongs
to a small group of outlier cases in this respect. This is
because (i) it is rather compact with P2/P1≃37.6, and
(ii) the third component is most likely a solar-type star
(Sec.3.4). Adopting the canonical value M1≃5.3 M⊙,
the plausible m2≃1 M⊙mass implies γ≃0.47, thus a
partial share of the inner and outer orbits on the total
angular momentum. Large variations of the inner or-
bit inclination i1(witnessed by the intermittent periods
of eclipses and no-eclipses) must therefore be accompa-
nied with certain variations of the inclination i2of the
outer orbit. The analytical solution ( 1) provides this
result readily: orienting the reference system as usual,
such that the XYplane coincides with the sky-plane,
the inclination i1(t) of the eclipsing system is simply
cosi1(t) =l1(t)·e3, whereeT
3= (0,0,1) (and similarly
for the outer orbit, with just replacing l1(t) byl2(t)).
It isuseful atthis moment tooverviewfreeparameters
of the analytical model whose values are to be adjusted
(solved for) when confronting with the data (Sec. 3.4).
Choosing the reference epoch T0, we ﬁrst have ˆl1andˆl2(normal unit vectors to the planes of the inner and
outer orbits) to select (note their composition with mag-
nitudesL1andL2of the angular momenta deﬁne the
unit vector lof the total angular momentum of the sys-
tem). Being unit vectors, each of the two would appar-
ently depend on two solved-for parameters. But given
the nature of the data we have, photometric and spec-
troscopicsets, thereisan arbitrarinessin selectionofthe
reference direction in the sky-plane. As a result, there
are only three solved-for parameters needed to charac-
terize the unit vectors ˆl1andˆl2. For instance, we may
assume
ˆl1=
0
−sinˆ ı1
cosˆ ı1
, (4)
whereˆ ı 1is the inner orbit inclination at T0, and
ˆl2(0) =
sinˆ ı2sinˆΩ2
−sinˆ ı2cosˆΩ2
cosˆ ı2
, (5)
where ˆ ı 2is the outer orbit inclination at T0, andˆΩ2
is the nodal phase tilt about e3of the outer orbit
with respect to the inner orbit. Therefore, we have
three solved-for model parameters (ˆ ı 1,ˆ ı2,ˆΩ2) of the ge-
ometrical nature. If only photometric data were avail-
able, one could complement this set of three parame-
ters with the precession frequency νto be the fourth
solved-for parameter, and use the inner system incli-
nation changes to determine their values (a formula-
tion dating back to Soderhjelm 1975 ). A partial step
forward was introduced by Juryˇ sek et al. (2018), who
used the photometrically-derived constraint on ν, and
formula Eq. ( 2) to set constraints on further physical
parameters, such as m2and often unknown P2for their
systems.
Here, though, we are in a slightly more comfortable
situation with both photometric and spectroscopic data
available, and we can thus aﬀord more general formu-
lation (though a really ambitious approach needs to
wait when more accurate data are available in the fu-
ture). At this moment, our procedure is similar to that
inVokrouhlick´ y & Zasche (2022). We consider the fre-
quencyνas an auxiliary variable only, and use Eq. ( 2)
to connect it with parameters of more interest, such as
the stellar masses or mutual inclination Jof the inner
and outer orbital planes. This does not mean that the
new parameters would have a fully correlated solution.
This is because (i) J, for instance, depends on ˆl1and
ˆl2on a more fundamental level (recall cos J=ˆl1·ˆl2),
and (ii) constraints following from the spectroscopic ob-
servations help to decorrelate the stellar masses. So in9
principle, all quantities on the right hand side of the
formula ( 2) may be adjustable in the process of data ﬁt-
ting. However, for some of them we assume that their
pre-constrained values from the analysis in Sec. 2are
precise to such a level that the data describing secular
evolution of the system would not result in improve-
ment (and in the same time, their uncertainty would
not signiﬁcantly aﬀect solution of the parameters which
are ﬁtted at this stage). For the sake of simplicity, we
thus adopt their best-ﬁt values and consider them con-
stant. This is the case of the mean orbital periods P1
andP2of the inner and outer orbits, and the eccentric-
itye2of the outer orbit. In fact, the latter appears in
νandL2only via the η2factor, and therefore depends
one2
2rather than e2. We are then left with the stel-
lar masses, of which m2is perhaps the most interesting.
This is because the analysis of the spectroscopic data in
Sec.2.2helps to directly constrain both m1aandm1b,
sincei1is well known at the epoch of the spectroscopic
observations from the conjoined photometric observa-
tions of the eclipsing system. A similar determination
ofm2from spectroscopy would need i2to be known,
but this is available from the long-term evolution model
only (and not directly from observations). Given the
still limited quality of available data, we thus resolve to
provide a preliminary solution for the V907 Sco system
at this moment. We ﬁxed m1aandm1bvalues deter-
mined in Sec. 2.1, and we adopt m2as the fourth solved
for parameter.
3.2.Numerical model for the long-period part
We used the secular model from Sec. 3.1to ﬁt the
photometric observations (Sec. 3.4and Fig. 6in par-
ticular) and reached the following conclusions: (i) the
model helps us to match the mean trend of the data ad-
equately, and allows us to characterizea large portion of
the parameter space which cannot lead to satisfactory
results(thus pre-constraintheparameterspace), but(ii)
formally the best ﬁt is statistically not acceptable (the
χ2from Eq. ( 6) is simply too large). While looking into
details, wenoticedthe reasonforthe situation: ontopof
the secular terms, there are also long-period perturba-
tions (periodicity P2and its multiples) that contribute
in a non-negligible way to the long-term evolution of i1
andi2values. Since the post-2019 photometric data are
rather accurate, it is important to include these terms
into the analysis. At the lowest-orders in the outer ec-
centricity e2they can be expressed analytically, e.g.,
Soderhjelm (1975) (but see already Brown 1936 ), and
represent a signal with periodicity P2/2. For larger e2
values, which is the case of V907 Sco, an accurate ana-
lytic formulation is not available to us. For that reason,we decided to resolve the situation by using a fully nu-
merical model, and proﬁt from the a priori parameter
constraints from the secular model described above. In-
terestingly, weﬁndthatathigh e2regimetheleadingpe-
riodicity of the long-term perturbation of both i1andi2
becomes P2(Fig.6).4Theset-upofthenumericalmodel
uses a point mass conﬁguration and Jacobi coordinates
(e.g.,Soderhjelm 1982 , Eqs. (1)). The near-coplanarity
of the inner- and outer-orbits in the V907 Sco system
also does not require us to include the gravitational in-
teraction ofthe starsin the eclipsing system as extended
bodies (beyond the point-mass level) that would be oth-
erwise needed for long-term stability if Jis large. None
oftheobservablequantitiesdependsonthesethree-body
eﬀects. Because the long period perturbations depend
on the mean longitude in orbit of the outer system at
the reference epoch T0, we must add it to the set of ad-
justable parameters. Taking the argument of pericenter
ω2from the analysis of radial velocities (Sec. 2.2), we let
the mean anomaly ℓ2be the ﬁfth solved-for parameter.
There is no a priori constraint on ℓ2, and its value is
allowed to sample the full interval of 360◦.
3.3.Dataset for long-term analysis
Data suitable for long-term analysis of the evolution
of V907 Sco consist of results from our analysis of the
photometric and spectroscopic observations at individ-
ual and separated intervals of time presented in Sec. 2.
Each of them provided at a certain epoch tj, usually at
the center of the relevant time interval, a value of a spe-
ciﬁc variable vjtogether with its uncertainty ∆ vj. The
triples (tj,vj,∆vj), withj= 1,...,N data, are the ba-
sis of our work in this section. The model described in
Secs.3.1and3.2allows us to compute the values ˆ vjof
these variables at the same epochs tj, and we can thus
use the standard χ2metric deﬁned by
χ2=Ndata/summationdisplay

, (6)
as a measure of the model quality. As expected, ˆ vj=
ˆvj(p), where p= (ˆ ı1,ˆ ı2,ˆΩ2,m2,ℓ2) constitute the ﬁve-
dimensional parametric space. Our procedure obviously
seeks minimization of χ2(p), reaching a minimum value

end we use the Q-function test, see Press et al. 2007 ,
Chap. 15.1), we seek conﬁdence limits on estimated
model parameters p. This is achieved by selecting a
certain volume Vin the parameter space characterized
byχ2≤χ2
⋆=χ2
min+ ∆χ2. For a ﬁve-dimensional
parameter space, and a 90% conﬁdence level limit, we
have to choose ∆ χ2= 9.24 (see, e.g., Press et al. 2007 ,Chap. 15.6). Projection of Vonto lower-dimensional
sections of the parameter space allows us to re-map the
statisticalanalysisontoothervariablesofinterest, which
do not constitute the basic set of dimensions by p(for
instance, wemaycharacterizethiswayacceptablevalues
of the precession period Pν= 2π/ν, as shown in Figs. 7
and9, or the mutual angle Jof the orbital planes, as11
shown in Fig. 9). Even simpler is just projecting Vonto
the individual axes deﬁned by each of the parameters p
(for instance to infer limits in the companion mass m2,
Figs.7and8).
Having outlined our procedure, we now return to the
choice of observables vj. Their sector based on photo-
metric observations consists of data summarized in Ta-
ble2, namely the inferred inclination values i1of the in-
ner binary orbit from mutual eclipses. This provides 14
datapoints. Next, the spectroscopic observations taken
at CTIO in 2022 provide further constrains. First, the
analysis of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the
stars in the eclipsing binary (Fig. 4), and the known
inclination i1at their epoch, provides values of masses
m1aandm1b. We consider them ﬁxed. The analysis
of the spectroscopic observations further provides radial
velocity data for the outer orbit with period P2, namely
how it aﬀects the systemic velocity of the barycenter
of the eclipsing binary (Fig. 5). This provides a con-
straint on the argument of pericenter ω2and the ec-
centricity e2that we also consider ﬁxed in our analy-
sis (we only tested the inﬂuence of making e2smaller
or larger than nominal). Being most interested in con-
straining the mass m2of the third, unseen star, we ob-
serve the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve in
Fig.5, from which we can derive the projected semi-
major axis a2,proj=a2(m2/M2) sini2(the semimajor
axis of the outer orbit is given by the Kepler’s third law
n2
2a3
2=GM2). We obtain, a2,proj,obs(ts) = 34.14 R⊙
with an uncertainty ∆ a2,proj,obs= 2.04 R⊙at a refer-
ence HJD epoch ts= 59760. This constitutes our addi-
tional data to be ﬁt by our model. Finally, we chose the
reference epoch T0= 59383.9 heliocentric Julian date,
namely the mid epoch of the TESS sector 39b observa-
tions (Tab. 2).
3.4.Results
We ran two sets of simulations: (i) ﬁrst using only the
photometric data, and (ii) second using both photomet-
ric data and spectroscopic constraints on the projected
semimajor axis of the outer orbit. Our intention was
to investigate how good the solution was using the pho-
tometric data alone, and how it potentially improves if
constraints from spectroscopy are added.
Figure6shows the best-ﬁtting solution of the in-
clination i1data, including also coupled variations of
the outer orbit inclination i2. The inclination of the
conserved total angular momentum (i.e., the invariable
plane) is ≃71◦, indicating the solution belongs to the
class 2 discussed by Lacy et al. (1999) in Sec. 4 of their
analysis (which they rightly favoured). The archival,
pre-2000data are formally inaccurate, nevertheless theyFigure 8. Probability density distribution of solutions for

help to signiﬁcantly constrain the solution. The mod-
ern data, especially those after 2021, are very accurate
and help constrain the solution even more. The im-
portant advantage of V907 Sco over the HS Hya case
(Vokrouhlick´ y & Zasche 2022 ) is the fact that the data
cover a time interval much longer than the precession
periodPν= 2π/ν. This makes the free-parameter val-
ues much better constrained: compare Fig. 7here with
Figs. 3 and 4 in Vokrouhlick´ y & Zasche (2022). Figure 8
presents the probability density distribution of the third
massm2. We obtain m2= 1.06+0.11
−0.10M⊙, representing
a 90% conﬁdence level interval. We brieﬂy tested the
sensitivity of the solution to changing the value of the
eccentricity e2of the outer orbit (which has been ﬁxed
in the illustrated solution to its nominal value 0 .467).
We found that slightly smaller or larger e2values would
shift the m2solution to slightly larger or smaller val-
ues. This is to be expected. For instance, smaller e2
would place the outer star more distant to the eclips-
ing binary. In order to produce the observed variations
ofi1values, one would thus need larger mass m2(and
vice versa). Figure 9presents the probability density
distribution of the precession period Pν, reﬂected in pe-
riodicity of variations of i1andi2in Fig.6, and the

γ≃0.47 from Eq. ( 3). TheJvalue is just large enough
to produce interesting orbital eﬀects, but smaller than
the critical value of ≃40◦for the onset of Kozai-Lidov
eﬀects (e.g., Soderhjelm 1982 ;Farago & Laskar 2010 ).
The use of a simple point-mass model in our simulations
is therefore well justiﬁed. We also note that the argu-
ment of pericenter of the outer orbit exhibits a drift of
≃1.35 degrees per year (this is not an observationally
detected value yet, but it follows from our numerical
simulation; see also Eq. (8) in Vokrouhlick´ y & Zasche
(2022)). This large value stems from compactness of
the system ( P2/P1not too large) and large mass of the
binary. This eﬀect needs to be taken into account, apart
fromthe changinginclinationvalues i1andi2, ifwewere
to interpret the radial velocity measurements reported
inLacy et al. (1999) (Table 3; see also Sec. 4).
Next, we added to the dataset the projected semi-
amplitude a2,projconstraint from the spectroscopic data
in 2022. We found that this single data point did not
improve the solution meaningfully at this moment. This
isbecause(i) thephotometricdataalreadyconstrainthe

isnotveryaccurateyet, principallybecausethe observa-
tions missed to detect precise moment of the pericenter
passage of the outer orbit (Fig. 5).
4.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Therecentonsetofeclipsesofthebinarycomponentof
the V907 Sco system recorded in the TESS data opened
a new opportunity to study this interesting triple. This
work is only an initial attempt in this direction, but it
nevertheless reveals important corrections to prior re-
sults. They are as follows:•masses of stars in the eclipsing binary, 2 .74±
0.02 M⊙and 2.56±0.02 M⊙, are about 8%
larger than previously thought; this is because
Lacy et al. (1999) assumed in their work an in-
accurate value of the inclination i1of the binary
orbital plane at the eﬀective epoch of their spec-
troscopic observations;
•our single-season spectroscopic data and a more
precise modeling work allowed us to constrain pa-
rameters of the orbit of the third star about the
center of mass of the binary; unlike previously
thought, we ﬁnd it has a signiﬁcant eccentricity
of 0.47±0.02 and a substantially longer period of
142.01±0.05 days;
•secular and long-period perturbations in i1pro-
duced by the third component in the system allow
us toconstrainitsmassof1 .06+0.11
−0.10M⊙anddeter-
mine mutual inclination of the two orbital planes
ofJ= 26.2+2.6
−2.2degrees.
Thesumofallknownparameters,bothorbitalandphys-
ical, is givenin Tables 1and3. In principle, one mayuse
those data to estimate, at least at zero order, the age
of stars in the eclipsing binary. However, we ﬁnd that
the result may sensitively depend on their yet unknown
metalicity. In any case, the values range in between
≃300 and≃500 Myr. This would mean that V907 Sco
is a rather young stellar system. More detailed analysis
of this issue, including consistency with the estimate of
a circularization timescale for the inner binary orbit, is
left for future eﬀorts.
The archival and incidental photometry data of
V907 Sco proved to be valuable for description of the
long-termchangesin its architecture. However,their ac-13

of a small aperture, may provide much better results
if the star is purposely targeted. Additionally, the sit-
uation of V907 Sco is fortuitous since the inclination
i1will be increasing to a nearly 90◦value for the next
decade and the system will be eclipsing until the year
∼2049 (Fig. 6). Therefore the upcoming years may of-
fer a chance to signiﬁcantly improve our understanding
of this unique system. As an example, Fig. 10shows
prediction of the increasing depth of primary eclipses
during the next decade, a trend reﬂecting the increase
of the inclination i1from Fig. 6. This progression holds
the promise for i1to be determined more precisely in
the coming years and for the results of this paper to be
improved upon rapidly.
The unfortunate miss of the outer orbit radial veloc-
ity minimum (Fig. 5) in our work strongly motivates
further eﬀorts to observe the V907 Sco system spectro-
scopically. An intense campaign around the epoch of
this minimum (the nearest chance in May 2023) would
be especially valuable. These data will help to pin down
values of both outer orbit period P2and its eccentricity
e2. Additionally, if the projected semimajor axis of the
outerorbit a2,projisbetter constrainedfromthesefuture
data, the analysis developed in this paper may readily
provide much better constraints of the mass m2.
We alsogive a brief lookat expected, but not detected
yet, eclipsetimevariations(ETVs)intheinnerbinaryof
V907 Sco. As the eclipse depth will continually increasein the future (Fig. 10), determination of the mid-eclipse
epochs will improve, thus permitting the discovery of
variations with respect to the mean period P1. If accu-
rate enough, proper interpretation of ETVs may help to
further constrain the physical parameters of the system.
Therearetwokinds ofETVs, andtheyaredistinguished
by their physical origins. First, the light-time (Roemer)
eﬀect is due to the ﬁnite speed of light and variations
of radial distance (projected along the line of sight) to
the eclipsed component in the binary due to its motion
aboutthebarycenterofthewholetriplesystem. Second,
the dynamical (physical) eﬀect has to do with gravita-
tional perturbation of the third star of the mean motion
of stars in the eclipsing binary. Analytical description
of the former is rather straightforward, while the same
for the latter requires a more involved technique of the
perturbation theory to be used. Over the past decade or
so, a thorough analysis has been developed by Borkovits
and collaborators (e.g., Borkovits 2022 , and references
therein). Here we speciﬁcally used two components of
the dynamical ETV signal given in Eqs. (8) and (9) in
(Rappaport et al. 2013 ), and we veriﬁed that additional
parts are very small. To make sure that this formula-
tion is suﬃcient, we also determined the dynamical part
of the ETVs using direct numerical integration. This is
basically the same simulation as shown in Fig. 6, but
here we paid special attention to the epochs of eclipses
of the two stars in the inner binary.
Results are shown in Fig. 11. We note the dynamical
eﬀect dominates by a factor of ∼5 over the light-time
eﬀect. This is because the system is compact ( P2/P1
small enough) and the mass of the third star not too
small (m2/M2large enough). The full amplitude of the
dynamical eﬀect, more than 10 minutes, appears large
enough to be safely detectable. Especially in the near
future when the eclipses will be deep enough, and also
the ground-baseddata would provide adequately precise
times of eclipses (which is not the case nowadays, and
the number of TESS data is still too limited).
At this moment, we did not attempt to further
constrain our solution for the orbital architecture
of V907 Sco by using radial velocities published by
Lacy et al. (1999). In principle, this is possible by sim-
ple propagation of our numerical model back to the
epochs of the spectroscopic observations from Table 3
inLacy et al. (1999), though one would need to assume
some uncertainty of the reported radial velocity values.
We plan to return to this issue after the system is better
constrained by well controlled and accurate photomet-
ric and spectroscopic observations in the next year. In
particular, V907 Sco will be in the ﬁeld of view of TESS
again in Sector 66 of its operations. This will provide14 Zasche et al.
Figure 11. Predicted value of ETVs (∆ T) for the primary
component in the V907 Sco. The abscissa is the cycle count
of the eclipsing binary (period P1= 3.776 day; the whole
timespan shown is therefore little more than two years), the
ordinate is in minutes. The red line is the dynamical (phys-
ical) delay due to the third-star perturbations of the mean
motion of the binary, the blue line is the light-time (Roe-
mer) eﬀect due to motion of the binary center of mass about
the barycenter of the whole system. Both are expressed an-
alytically (e.g., Rappaport et al. 2013 ). Symbols show the
dynamical delay determined numerically for sake of compar-
ison. The perihelion of the outer orbit motion occurs where
the gradient of the dynamical eﬀect change is the largest.
very accurate photometric data. Second, we now have a
fairlygoodconstraintwhen the systemwillpassthrough
the pericenter of the outer orbit. We can thus make ef-
forts to give a high priority to observation during that
time period. Such targeted spectroscopic observations
will help to improve parameters of the outer orbit, and
consequently to constrain the mass m2of the third star
in the system.
Assuming our solution for m2≃1.06 M⊙is correct,
one may question the role of the radiative ﬂux of the
third component in the V907 Sco system in our analy-
sis of the lightcurves during eclipses of the inner binary
(the so called third light problem). Given the masses
m1aandm1bin the range 2 .54 to 2.74 M⊙, we can esti-
mate the third light contribution at the level 5 %. This
is in a good accordance with the TESS lightcurve anal-
ysis in Sec. 2, which indicated the third light should be
around this value. In the same way, the small ≃0.008
eccentricity of the inner binary is close to the forced
valuebythecompanionstarofapproximatelysolarmass
and the orbital parameters listed in Table 3(see, e.g.,
Georgakarakos 2009 , end references therein).
To conclude with a speculative comment, we note
that there is a ﬁeld star UCAC2 17118369 = 2MASS
J17565485-3444584 separated from V907 Sco by ≃9′′
(possibly the object shown by Lacy et al. 1999 , in their
Fig. 1). Interestingly, the WDS catalogue records the
two stars to be a proper-motion pair ( Mason et al.2001). More importantly though, the Gaia DR3 pro-
vides (i) the same distances to both objects within their
uncertainty, and (ii) conﬁrms verysimilar values of their
proper motion (though in this case slightly outside their
uncertainty overlap, Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022 ). A
detailed look into the putative gravitational bound be-
tween the two stars is beyond the scope of the present
paper. Here we only mention that (i) their ≃3.5 magni-
tude diﬀerence contributes insigniﬁcantly, if any, to our
TESS photometry analysis in Sec. 2, and (ii) the large
distance of the companion cannot have inﬂuence on our
analysis of the V907 Sco triple dynamics.
