   2 Abstract:  Transient e lectric fields across cell  bilayer membranes can lead to  electroporation , 
as well as to cell fusion , and  have been extensively studied1-7. We find that transmembrane 
electric fi elds similar to those in cells  can lead to a massive, reversible modulation – by up to 
200-fold – of the interfacial energy dissipation between surfaces sliding across the lipid 
bilayer  membranes . Atomistic simulations reveal that this arises from (fully r eversible) 
electroporation of the interfacially -confined bilayers , and formation of bilayer bridges 
analogous to stalks preceding intermembrane fusion . These cell -membrane -mimicking effects 
topologically -force the slip to partially -revert from the low -dissipation, hydrated lipid -
headgroups plane to the intra -bilayer, high -dissipation acyl tail interface8,9. Our results 
demonstrate that lipid bilayers  under transmembrane electric fields  can have striking 
materials -modification properties , and shed new light on  membrane hemifusion . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  3 Transmembrane electric fields  (of order 107-108 V/m)  that arise from cell-membrane 
potential fluctuations lead to bilayer electroporation, while  similar  fields result in  hemifusion 
and fusion of cells ; both are biologically -important effects  that have been much 
investigated3,5,10 -12. However, t he implications of such field -induced structural changes in 
lipid membranes for the ir physical interfacial  - as opposed to biological - properties has not, 
to our knowledge , been examined . This is  despite the fact that s imilar transverse  fields can 
readily  arise  across lipid bilayers separating two solid surfaces  as a result of  small potential 
differences (O(0.1 V)) across  them . Using  the effect of electric field s to modify interfacial 
properties in this way may be  especially attractive , due to the ease of externally applying  and 
changing electric potentials on solid surfaces, with clear practical ramifications . At issue , 
therefore,  is whether transmembrane potentials exploited by nature, and intensively studied in 
the context of cellular biochemical processes , can be utilized in a materials context.    
 
The recent discovery that lipid bilayers confined between sliding surfaces can ma ssively 
reduce interfacial energy losses13,14 via the hydration lubrication mechanism15,16, opens the 
prospect of large,  in situ  modulation of this dissipation process  via transmembrane fields. In 
particular, phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers or vesicles (liposomes), form surface boundary 
layers  which strongly reduce interfacial  energy dissipation  on sliding13,17. This  may be 
quantif ied (Methods section 9) by a suitable proxy  as a dimensi onless friction coefficient  (= 
[force to slide]/[load compressing surfaces]) , down to  ≈ 10-4. They are t hus suitable 
candidates for electro modulation  of such dissipation over a large dynamic range . 
  4 Varying potentials across lipid bilayers  
We examine the effect on the interfacial dissipation of varying the potential difference 
between metal (gold) and dielectric (mica) solid substrates, each bearing a PC lipid boundary 
layer (either a lipid bilayer or a liposome monolayer), as they contact a nd slide past each 
other in water. The surfaces are mounted in a crossed cylinder geometry (mean radius of 
curvature R ≈ 1 cm) in a surface force balance (SFB), in a 3 -electrode configuration (figure 
1A). The potential at the gold surface gold may be varied via the potentiostat -applied 
potential app, and is determined by fitting the normal force ( Fn(D)) vs. separation ( D) 
profiles to the Poisson -Boltzmann (PB) equation, as indicated in figure 1B. Mica bears a 
fixed negative charge density in w ater due to loss of surface K+ ions (and thus has a negative 
surface potential mica,  when the surfaces are far apart18), so that, knowing gold, the 
potential variation and field between the two surfaces may be evaluated19,20 (Methods section 
5). The surfaces are coated by layers of distearoylphosphatidylcholines (DSPCs) or 
palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine s (POPCs), through incubation in dispersions of small 
unilamellar vesicles (SUVs, or liposomes) of the respective lipids, followed by washing, and 
then re -mounted in the SFB.  The resulting morphology of the surface -attached lipid 
assemblies is determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in figures 1C, D, 
revealing that the gel -phase DSPC -SUVs adsorb as close -packed vesicles, while the liquid -
phase POPC -SUVs rupture on the surfaces to form bilayers, consistent with earlier work13,21.

Figure 1 : Experimental setup and characterization of surfaces.  (A) Schematic of the three -
electrode modified surface force balance (SFB)19. Gold and back -silvered mica surfaces are 
mounted in cross -cylinder co nfiguration for the interferometric measurements of separation 
D, enabling measurement of normal inter -surface forces Fn via bending of spring Kn, while 
shear  forces Fs are measured via bending of the shear spring Ks. The e quivalent  electric 
circuit includes the gold surface as the working electrode (W), two platinum wires as counter 
(C) and quasi -reference electrodes (R), and a potentiostat as the control unit  (Methods s ection 
1). (B) Normal interaction profiles Fn(D)/R between the bare gold and mica surfaces , across 
purified water with no added salt,  at different applied potentials  app enable determination of 
the gold surface potential Ψgold via fitting  to the  Poisson -Boltzmann equation, with constant 
charge density (mica) and constant surface potential (gold) boundary conditions19 (Methods  
section 2). Color-coded table (insert) shows Ψgold evaluated from the fits (solid curves) at 
 6 different applied potentials Ψapp. (C) and ( D): Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) images of 
DSPC l iposomes and POPC bilayers adsorbed respectively on mica and gold surface s in 
water , with height profile s below  (Methods section 3) (the respective liposomes had a similar 
morphology whether on mica or on gold , fig. S3 in Extended Data ). 
 
Bilayer shear dissipation under electric fields  
Normal and shear  force  profiles  Fn(D) and Fs(Fn) respectively between the opposing lipid -
coated surfaces were  determined in the SFB at different gold values . These  are shown in fig. 
2, either  at app = -300 mV , for which gold is similar in magnitude and of the same sign as  
mica ,, in which case the mean field across the intersurface gap vanishes ; or at app = 200 
mV, for whic h gold is similar in magnitude  but of  opposite sign to mica , (fig. 1B ), for 
which a strong electric field (O(108) V/m)) is expected across the gap.  (Methods  section 5).  
For the case of POPC bilayers on each surface (fig. 2A), the long-ranged repulsion is due 
largely to counterion osmotic pressure when the gold and mica potentials are similar , as 
indicated by the solid line based on solution of the Poisson -Boltzmann (PB) equation 
(Methods  section 4). When they are of opposite sign , a clear long-ranged attraction between 
them is observed (red data in fig. 2A)  as expected  and previously observed , arising from 
escape  of counterion -pairs19,20. The limiting high -compression (or ‘hard -wall’) separation Dhw 
= 8.9 ±  0.8 nm corresponds to a POPC bilayer o n each surface (as cartoon inset in fig. 2A) , as 
indicated also by the AFM micrographs (fig. 1D). For the DSPC layers the interaction, fig. 
2B, is monotonically repulsive for D ≲ 150 - 200 nm , and not significantly dependent on the 
gold potential, implying  that the repulsion is dominated by steric forces between the adsorbed 
liposomes which overcome any electrostatic interaction between them, as also earlier  7 observed13. The limiting (‘hard -wall’) separation at the highest compressions, Dhw = 20.4 ±  
1.2 nm, equivalent to some 4 DSPC bilayers, corresponds to a flattened liposome layer on 
each surface  (cartoon  inset in fig. 2 B), in line with the AFM images (fig s. 1C, S3) showing 
close -packed vesicles. The effective mean pressures over the contact areas range up to ca. 4 x 
106 N/m2 (~ 40 atms) ( Methods  section 4). 
 
Figure 2 : Normal and shear  force profiles between lipid -bearing mica and gold surfaces at 
different applied potentials  on the gold . (A) Normal ized load Fn/R versus separation D 
profiles  between POPC -coated  surfaces , across purified water with no added salt : the long -
ranged repulsion at negative gold potential is due to counterion osmotic pressure between the 
surfaces (solid line is theoretical fit based on PB equation, Methods  section  2), while f or 
positive gold potential there is a long -ranged attraction  (arrow J indicates jump -in of the 
 8 surfaces) . The ‘hard -wall’ repulsion at Dhw=8.9±0.8 nm (dashed line)  corresponds to a POPC 
bilayer on each surface (cartoon i nsert ). (B) Normal force Fn(D)/R profiles between DSPC -
liposome covered surfaces at different potentials, across water . The similar long -ranged 
interactions at both positive and negative gold potentials are attributed to steric repulsion by 
loosely -attached liposomes . The ‘hard -wall’ rep ulsion at Dhw= 20.4±1.2 nm (dashed line)  
corresponds to 4 bilayers of DSPC, indicating a compressed liposome layer on each surface 
(cartoon i nsert ). (C) and ( D): Shear force  Fs(Fn) profiles corresponding to ( A) and (B) 
respectively . Inserts are typical directly -measured time  traces of applied lateral motion (top  
trace ) and corresponding shear  force  (middle and bottom). The shear force  profiles show a 
reversible change of friction coefficient μ between μ~O(10-4) and μ ≈ 0.1  when chan ging 
from negative to positive potential on the gold (data color scheme same as (A)  and (B) ). For 
all panels, full/empty symbols are for first and second approach of surfaces at the same 
contact point, while the consecutive negative (blue data)/positive (r ed data)/negative (green 
data) profiles demonstrate reproducibility and reversibility on toggling the potential . 
 
In contrast to the normal forces , a striking  difference is seen in t he shear -force  profiles Fs vs. 
Fn between the  compressed,  lipid-bearing surfaces , figs. 2 C, D, depending on whether their 
potentials are of similar or of opposite sign. For similar negative potentials of the two 
surfaces (i.e. gold ≈ mica, ) energy dissipation on sliding and shear  is very low with  ≈ 10-3 
or lower . This is a ttributed to hydration lubrication at the slip -plane between the highly -
hydrated phosphocholine headgroups exposed by the opposing lipid layers,  much as earlier 
observed in a symmetric configuration between two  similar  negative -potential , lipid-bearing 
mica surfaces  13.  On applying  app = +200 mV  to the gold surface , however  (for which 
gold ≈ -mica, ), the shear  force abruptly increases by some two or more orders of 
magnitude , to  ≈ 0.1. This change , which is seen for both lipid types,  is fully reversible, with  9  immediately (< 1 sec) reverting to its low value (  ≲ 10-3) on setting app = -300 mV 
again.  
  
We eliminated th e possibility  that the increase  in shear force  is due to an increased 
electrostatic attraction pulling the spring -mounted lower surface towards the upper surface 
when they are at opposite potential  (which would be equivalent to a sudden increase in 
normal load) . This is done  by locking the normal -force spring Kn (fig. 1A) , thereby 
suppressing normal motion between the surfaces . The resulting shear for ce behaviour  in situ , 
i.e. during sliding of the compressed surfaces, is shown in fig s. 3A. This demonstrat es 
directly  that the change in energy dissipation  on sliding is due to field-induced changes in the 
lipid boundary layers themselves  rather than to any changes of the normal forces between the 
surfaces . Thus high or low values of the shear force, corresponding to the energy dissipation 
on sliding,  may be readily achieved by toggling the potential applied to the gold surface , as in 
the traces in fig. 3A, or in  fig. 3B . Finally, we measure the effect of high salt concentrations, 
0.1 M NaNO 3, on the potential -modulation of the shear dissipation , as shown in figs 3 C, D 
for surfaces bearing DSPC vesicles. At such salt levels counterions remain trappe d between 
the surfaces when they are compressed, and screen the surface charges, so that both for 
similar and for opposite surface potentials ( gold ≈mica,  or gold ≈ -mica, ) the field 
between the surfaces is suppressed ( Methods  section 6). Thus w hile the normal forces, fig. 
3C, are essentially unchanged relative to the pure water case (shaded band in fig. 3C), as both 
arise from steric forces due to surface -attached liposomes, the shear  forces, fig. 3D, are no 
longer sensitive to the applied potential.  In consequence,  both for similar and for opposite  10 potentials on the opposing surfaces we see that  ≈ 0.005, comparable to its value in earlier 
studies between two mica surfaces bearing PC vesicles at high salt22. This demonstrates 
directly that it is the electric field across the surfaces at low salt conc entrations that is 
responsible for the massive modulation in sliding dissipation seen in figs. 2C, D.  
 
Figure 3 :  Potential -modulation of shear force  Fs(t) between DSPC -bearing mica and gold 
surfaces in situ , and at high salt concentration.  (A) Change of Fs(t) between the compressed 
sliding surfaces in pure water as the potential on the gold is changed during sliding : Upper 
trace I is the back -and-forth lateral motion  applied  to the upper mica surface, while lower 
trace  II shows shear  force Fs(t) transmitted to the lower surface mounted on the locked 
normal spring (cartoon inset) . At arrows in trace II  the potential change s from  Ψapp=200 mV 
(high field) to -300 mV  (negligible  field) and back again . Since any normal motion is 
eliminated by the spring -locking, the reversible changes in Fs are due  only to field -induced 
 11 changes in the boundary layer rather than to any change in compressive load . (B) Shear force  
Fs(Fn) profiles summarizing  the in situ  reversible change s as the potential is toggled, from 
traces such as  in (A). (C) Normal force Fn(D)/R profiles of DSPC -liposome covered surfaces 
across 0.1 M NaNO 3 solution at different potentials showing repulsive interactions ( Fn/R>0) 
similar to results in water  with no added salt from fig. 2C  (grey shade d), and arising from 
long-ranged steric repulsion s due to adsorbed liposomes . Dashed line is the hard -wall 
separation Dhw = 19.9 ± 1.0 nm , corresponding to 2 compressed liposome layers as 
illustrated in the cartoon inset . (D) Shear force  Fs(Fn) profiles for the system in  (C), showing 
as shaded strips the corresponding Fs(Fn) profiles in salt-free water  (fig. 2D) . The large Fs 
change induced by potential toggling in pure water  is no longer seen  in 0.1 M NaNO 3, which 
is attributed  to screening of the inter -surface field s at the high salt concentration  (Methods 
section 6). 
 
Atomistic simulation of bilayer s under electric fields  
To elucidate the origin of this up -to-200-fold reversible change in the interfacial energy 
dissipation on sliding  as the potential is toggled – a far higher dynamic range than any 
previously observed23 - we ca rried out comprehensive atomistic ( all-atom ) molecular 
dynamics simulations carefully designed to represent realistically the experimental conditions  
(Methods section 8  and refs.24,25). The results are summarized in fig. 4, where we focus on  the 
case of opposing POPC bilayers.

Figure 4 : Atomistic simulation results for lipid bilayers confined between solid slabs of gold 
and mica. a) Simulation set -up of the confined POPC double -bilayer system . The gold slab is 
fixed in z, and a constant force is exerted  on the mica slab  to correspond to  a mean normal 
stress N ≈ 10 atm . Periodic boundary condition s are imposed  in x and y. Vacuum space is 
imposed at top and bottom to eliminate interaction between  the solid slabs across the periodic 
boundary in z. An electric field is applied using the charge -imbalance method (Methods  
section 8). Lipid molecules —blue: nitrogen, gold: phosphorus, red: oxygen, cyan: carbon; 
white: hydrogen. Water molecules —red: oxygen, white: hydrogen.  b) Snapshots  of sections 
in the x-z plane  of the electroporated POPC double -bilayer systems at the limiting  hydration 
levels ( confining solid slabs not shown). Left: nw =12 water/lipid. Right: nw = 20 water/lipid. 
c) Schematic of the electroporation effects on the bilayer -bilayer interface. d) Distributions of 
the P -N angles  to +z direction for each monolayer (ML),  as indicated in the cartoon,  where 
ML 1 - 4 correspond to the monolayer on gold to th e monolayer on mica in order  (nw = 12) . 
Solid lines correspond to the system under zero electric field, and dashed lines correspond to 
the system equilibrated under an electric field  E = 0.1 V/nm . The energy of the 
phosphocholine dipole in the field is U =  E.D, where D = 6.4 ×  10–29 C.m is its dipole 
moment26, yielding U ≈ 2.2 × 10-21 J ≈ 0.5 k BT, where k B is Boltzmann’s constant and T is 
 13 ambient temperature . e) snapshots of the P -N vectors of ML2 (blue) and ML3 (orange) for 
the n w=12 system equilibrated at E = 0  and at E ≈ 0.1 V/ nm, showing the clear reduction in 
the dipole separation following poration . f) Closest separations between nearest neighbours 
(P-N, N -N or P-P) from opposing bilayers . The lower and higher values for each pair are for 
the nw = 12 water/lipid and 20 water/l ipid cases respectively.   
 
When the POPC bilayers  are compressed between two solid slabs, the mean number of water 
molecules per lipid, nw, is expected to be the minimal level primarily contributed by the 
hydration shells around the phosphocholine groups : nw ≈ 12 by existing studies of MD 
simulations and by NMR measurements27,28. In the ex periments, the bilayer -coated surfaces 
are rinsed with pure water after being incubated in liposome dispersion  (Methods  section 1), 
to remove excess material , leading  to micrometer sized water defects in the bilayers  (ref. 29 
and fig. S4 in Extended Data ) and thus to locally increased hydration levels. By analyzing the 
AFM images of water defects on the lipid -coated surfaces prepared we estimate an increased 
value of ca. 20 water molecules/lipid (Methods section 7  and fig. S4). Thus we may take the 
lipid hydration level (i.e. water molecules/lipid) to be nw ≈ 12 water/lipid, with nw ≈  20 
water/lipid representing locally increased values.  
The detailed simulations are described elsewhere ( Methods  section 8 and refs.24,25; see also 
refs.30-32). Briefly, the equilibration of the bilayers is first carried out on the bilayer -only 
systems, i.e. no confining solid surfaces. This closely  mimics (unconfined) cell membranes 
under transverse fields4, as well as allow ing their expansion due to any field -induce d 
structural changes (see below). Next, with the addition of the confining solid mica and gold  14 slabs fitted to the size of the bilayer membranes,  the respective systems are equilibrated again 
under the same electric field, and at a surface pressure N = 10±1 atm (Figure 4a), 
characteristic of the contact pressures applied in the SFB experiments. Importantly, the main 
structural changes  observed for the unconfined bilayers under the field remain essentially 
unchanged on equilibration under this solid confinement. Finally, the sliding simulations, 
during which the inter -surface shear stress s is measured, are carried out by pulling the g old 
slab in the x-direction at different sliding velocities vs from 0.1 to 1 m/s. We note that these 
velocities are much higher than in the SFB experiments where vs, SFB = O(10-6 m/s).   
  
Our results reveal that under an electric field E = 0.1 V/ nm, simila r to the SFB experiments, 
the lipid bilayers undergo poration  for both nw = 12 and nw = 20, as indicated in fig. 4 b, in 
line with earlier studies of bilayers under similar electric fields (though these were at much 
higher nw values2,30,31,33 -38). Remarkably, in about a third  of the nw = 20 simulations, bridging  
of the intersurface gap by the bilayers i s observed, as in fig. 4 b (right panel), a feature not 
reported before for electro -porated bilayers . Such bridges, as discussed below, are 
reminiscent of stalk structures which are a precursor to membrane hemifusion.  In all cases 
both poration and bridging  structures rapidly revert to their unperturbed, intact -bilayers 
structure  on switching the field off (movie S5). The process is schematically illustrated in fig. 
4c.   
 
On sliding, the shear stresses s(vs) measured in the simulations vary linearly with vs, as 
earlier observed39, and may be extrapolated to the lower velocities of the SFB experiments.  15 When this is done24,25, the values of the friction coefficients (  = s/N) are similar to the 
experimental values: the simulations show that  = O(0.1) at E = 0.1 V/nm, comparable with 
the SFB values (figures 2 and 3), while, in the absence of an electric field,  ≈ 0, within an 
uncertainty encompassing the low SFB -measured values  ≈ 10-3 – 5.10-4 (figures 2 and 3). 
Thus our atomistic simulation results are fully consistent with the experimental observations, 
particularly the large reversible change in the shear force as the electric field is switched on 
and off.  
 
Molecular origins of bilayer dissipation modulation    
What is the molecul ar origin of this strong modulation  in the interfacial energy dissipation ? It 
is tempting to attribute it to rotation of the strongly -dipolar interfacial phosphocholine 
headgroups in the electric field. This would align the P-...N+ dipoles more strongly wi th 
similar dipoles on the opposing bilayer, thus increasing the electrostatic attraction between 
them and hence the interfacial  dissipation on sliding. However, despite the field -dipole 
interaction energy E.D being comparable with k BT, the thermal randomization energy,  where 
D  is the phosphocholine dipole moment  (fig. 4d caption) , the change in mean orientation of 
all P-...N+ dipoles under the 0.1 V/ nm field is negligible , as seen in fig. 4d and as also 
indicated earlier40. This is likely due to the close packing  of phosphocholine head -groups in 
the compressed bilayers  suppressing their freedom to rotate . Field -induced dipole rotation 
cannot therefore be the explanation for the observed electro -modulation of the interfacial 
energy dissipation on sliding .  
  16 We attribute the origin rather to the same effects as experienced by the membranes of cells 
arising from transverse electric fields as described earlier1-7,11,12,41, namely a strong, reversible 
structural/topological transformation experienced by the bilayers on electro poration, as 
indicated in fig. 4 b. This affects the energy dissipation on sliding in two ways , acting in 
parallel . For  bilayers at  both the nw = 12 and nw = 20 limits , the undulations and convoluted 
pore topology induced by the electroporation ( seen in fig. 4b, and schematically  in 4c, lower 
panel) increase the effective surface area of the interfacial lipid headgroups. Together with 
sequestration of water in the pores, this leads to lower hydration levels42 at the lipid -lipid 
interface s and thus to a substantial decrease in the mean spacing between dipoles exposed b y 
opposing bilayers, as seen in fig s. 4e and 4f . It increase s the electrostatic interaction between 
the dipoles, and thus the energy dissipation  as the bilayers slide past each other , causing the 
slip-plane to revert in part to the acyl tail -tail interface . The second effect relates to formation 
of bridges (as in fig. 4 b, right panel): the bridge topology no longer enables a slip plane 
exclusively at hydrated lipid -headgroup interfaces, but also forces sliding to occur across an 
acyl tail -tail interface. Such sliding  between acyl tail layers , where van der Waals bonds are 
broken and reformed, is known to be associated with much higher energy dissipation  than at 
hydrated interfaces, with  = O(0.1)8,9, similar to that observed in the experiments . (fig. 2 C, 
D). Meanwhile, s lip at the bilayer -solid interface s where phosphocholine groups are strongly 
attached by dipole -charge and van der Waals interactions21 is expected to be even more 
highly dissipative and thus not to occur . 
  17 These bridges (as in fig. 4(b , right )) which topologically -modify the interfacial dissipation 
are, as noted earlier, essentially identical to the well -known stalk formation between bilayers 
which is a precursor to hemifusion43-47, and thus to membrane fusion. Our observation that 
such stalks form in response to electric fi elds similar to those that occur spontaneously across 
cell membranes due to transient potential fluctuations4 may thus shed ligh t on the initial 
stages of the hemifusion process which in turn leads to membrane fusion1,5,48.  
 
Conclusions  
Our results demonstrate that the same  biologically -important ch anges that lipid -bilayer 
membrane s of cells undergo in response to transmembrane electric fields, namely 
electroporation  (enabling ion transport)  and stalk formation (as precursor to membrane 
hemi fusion)  can be exploited for strong modification of material  properties . For the case of 
PC lipid bilayers confined between two surfaces, transverse electric fields, of magnitude 
similar to those across cell membranes4, lead to  massive, reversible modulation of interfacial 
disspation  between two sliding surfaces coated with PC lipid layers . The  dynamic range of 
such changes is up to 2 orders of magnitude larger than previously reported  for similar field-
induced changes  in non -lipid interfacial layers23,49. The molecular origins of this, indicated  by 
detailed atomistic simulations  (fig. 4 and 24,25), arise from the structural changes induced by 
electroporation of the bilayers, and are twofold: Firstly, the convoluted poration topology 
leads to stronger headgroup interactions resulting from decreased interfacial water  per unit 
area at the bilayer -bilayer slip-plane. Secondly, the presence of inter -surface bridges 
(analogous  to stalks  preceding intermembrane fusion43-47) topologically eliminates the  18 possibility of full slip at hydrated headgroup -headgroup interfaces. In both cases the increase 
in interfacial d issipation  is associated with  reversion or partial reversion of the slip -plane 
from the hydrated head -group interface to that between the acyl tails. This effect is fully 
reversible on toggling the potential , and is shown25 to lead to interfacial dissipation fully 
consistent with our experimental results . To sum: while transmembrane potentials have been 
intensively studied in the context of cell bio logy, their surprisingly large effects on the lipid 
bilayers’ interfacial  properties  are quite novel . This  may have implications in the context of  
cellular biophysics  through its relation to membrane hemifusion  and fusion , while i n a 
materials context they may be relevant  whenever solid surfaces are in contact across lipid -
bilayers . This is because such layers are nanometrically thick, resulting in large transverse 
electric fields for even small potential differences between them. These, as we have 
demonstrated, can lead to large and reversible modulation of the interfacial properti es 
through the same mechanisms as utilized by nature in cell membranes.

   32 Materials and Methods  
 
1. Surface force balance (SFB) experiments  
Single -crystal sheets of r uby muscovite mica (Grade I, S & J trading, Inc., N.Y.) suitable 
for the SFB were prepared and back -silvered as previously described  50. The molecularly 
smooth gold surface is prepared u sing the template -stripping method as previously described 
by Chai et al51. The mica sheets and gold surface were glued on lenses for  mounting in the 
SFB.  
 
Small unilamellar lipid vesicles (SUVs)  of the DSPC and POPC (Lipoid, Germany) were  
prepared using a standard extrusion method  as described previously 52 in pur ified water (18.2 
MΩ•cm, TOC≤1 ppb, from a BarnsteadTM GenPureTM system, Thermal Scientific, U.S.A.) 
and the respective  SUVs dispersion s were  stored at 4 oC for less than 12 hours before use.  
The dispersion were diluted 10 -fold to 0.5 mM concentration . The freshly prepared gold and 
mica surfaces were  incubated in the respective dispersion  overnight for adsorptio n, rinsed 
using 250 mL of pure water and mounted in the SFB . 
 
SFB measurements  
The normal force Fn(D) and lateral friction Fs are measured using a three -electrode -
modified SFB, as described earlier by Tivony et a l53,54 and shown schematically in fig. 1A 
(main text) . A more detailed schematic is shown in fig. S1 (Extended Data ). Briefly, two 
fused silica lenses, covered by back -slivered mica and gold, are mounted in cross -cylinder  33 configuration, equivalent to the geometry of a sphere over a flat surface . The interference 
between reflective gold and silver layers led to the formation of interference fringes 
(Newtonian rings) project ed onto the spectrometer, through which the wavelength s of fringes 
of equal chromatic order (FECO) are  measured , to yield t he absolute separation D between 
the mica and gold surfaces using the “multilayer matrix method”55. The gold surface 
potentials are controlled using a three -electrode configuration consisting of gold as working 
electrode (W), two platinum wires as the quasi -reference electrode (R) and counter electrode 
(C), as shown in  fig. 1A (main text) . All three electrodes are connected to a potentiostat 
(CHI600C, CH  Instruments, Inc.) that serves as the control unit.  
The normal forces are measured via either a quasi -static stepwise approach56 or a dynamic 
approach with photo grabbing  57. Normal forces Fn(D) at separation D as the surfaces approach 
are measured via be nding of the normal force spring Kn (fig. 1A). L ateral motion is applied to 
the upper lens through a sectored piezoelectric tube on which it is mounted,  and any lateral 
frictional force  Fs between them are transmitted to the lower surface and monitored directly 
via the bending of the spring Ks (fig. 1A). Typical lateral motion and shear force vs. time traces 
are shown inset into figs. 2C, D . 
 In the dynamic approach, the lower lens is move d upwards continuously using a motor at 
speed v0, while the corresponding fringe motion is recorded using Sony XR70 digital camera 
at 60 fps with 1024× 768 resolution. The front of the fringe is fitted using double -gaussian 
peak model to extract the peak wavelength position  58, which is used to calculate the surface  
separation D. The normal force Fn(D) is calculated using equation M157: 
𝐹𝑛(𝐷)=−𝐾𝑛(𝛿𝐷(𝑡))+6𝜋𝑅2𝜂[(d𝐷
d𝑡)𝐷(𝑡) ⁄ ]     (M1)  34 where δ D(t)=Dt=0-D(t)+v0t, R is the mean radi us of curvature  of the mica and gold surfaces , t 
is the time, and η is the viscosity of water  57. 
 
2. Determination of mica surface charge density and the gold surface potential  
The mica surface potential is estimated by fitting normal force Fn(D)/R profiles measured 
using the dynamic approach, between two identical mica surfaces across pure water using the 
Derjaguin -Landau -Vervey -Overbeek (DLVO) expression (e quation M2)59: 
𝐹𝑛(𝐷)
𝑅=128 𝜋𝑐𝑘𝐵𝑇𝜅−1tanh2(𝑒𝛹mica ,
4𝑘B𝑇)exp(−𝜅𝐷)−𝐴H
6𝐷2        (M2) 
where c is the ion concentration, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (296 K), 
AH is the relevant mica -water -mica Hamaker constant (=2 ×10-20 J)60, Ψmica , is the far -field 
(D→∞) mica surface potential, κ-1 is the Debye length ( =√𝜖0𝜖r𝑘B𝑇2𝑒2𝑐 ⁄  for 1:1 
electrolyte , 𝜖0 and 𝜖r are the dielectric constant of vacuum and relative dielectric constant 
of media) and e is the electron charge. Typical  Fn(D)/R profiles  using this approach are 
shown in fig. S2. The parameters , mica surface potential Ψmica , and ion concentration c are 
extracted from the fit . The mica surface charge densi ty mica is then calculated using the 
Grahame equation  [11] (Equation M3): 
mica = √8𝑐𝜖0𝜖r𝑘B𝑇sinh (𝑒𝛹mica
2𝑘B𝑇)                      (M3) 
 
 The gold surface potentials Ψgold relative to the bulk at different applied potentials Ψapp 
are extracted by fitting the normal force profiles Fn(D)/R between bare gold and mica surface 
in water ( Figure 1B  in main text ), using the 1D Poisson -Boltzmann equa tion ( M4, where x is 
the distance from the surface, Ψ is the potential) with constant surface charge density (mica)  35 versus constant surface potential (gold) boundary conditions61, and with the van der Waals 
term -AH/6D2 (AH=9×10-20 J62). The mica surface charge density mica, ion concentration c, 
and temperature T (=296 K) are independently known (see above) , yielding  the gold surface 
potential Ψgold as the only fitting parameter.

3. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)  
Topographies of lipid -coated gold and mica surfaces are acquired using AFM (MFP -3D, 
Asylum Research, Oxford, U.K.) in noncontact tapping mode across aqueous media at open 
circuit potential. SNL -10 tips (spring constant 0.21 N/m) from Bruke are used in all scans 
after gently rinsed by ethanol and cleaned by UV for 15 minutes. Samples for AFM scans are 
prepared as described above in a glass petri dish and glass slides are used as the mechanical 
support for the template -stripped gold surfaces . 
 
4. Evaluation of t he mean contact pressure  
The radius a of the contact area between a sphere, radius R, and a flat (the effective 
geometry of the crossed -cylindrical surfaces in the SFB) under a load Fn is a = (FnR/K)1/3, 
according to the  Hertzian contact model60, where K is their effective modulus (essentially that 
of the glue layer attaching the opposing gold and mica surfaces to the lenses). T he mean  
effective modulus K is extracted from two independent measurements  of the flattening – at 
the tips of the optical fringes [1] - at known loads  (Table S1, Extended Data ), while R ≈ 1 cm 
is the mean radi us of curvature , measured separately for each experiment [1] . The mean  36 pressure over the contact area is then evaluated as  P = Fn/(a2) =𝐹n1/3𝐾2/3
𝜋𝑅2/3⁄  for all 
normal loads . 
 
 
5. Estimating the electric field across the membrane -water systems  
We consider the field in the two cases: at app = -300 mV, when the gold potential, gold is 
large and negative ( gold  = - 103 mV, from fig. 1B) , and at app = + 200 mV, when gold  
is large and positive  ( gold  = + 105 mV, from fig. 1B), as follows. In the first case, gold < 
0, the surface charge density gold on the gold surface at large D is negative; likewise the 
opposing mica surface is negatively charged (a fixed charge density due to loss of K+ ions as 
noted in the main text), which from the force  profiles in fig. S2 may be evaluated as mica = -
5.24 mC/m2. As the two lipid -bearing charged surfaces approach, excess counterions will be 
trapped in the gap between them to neutralize the charges on both surfaces. The resulting 
repulsion, as seen in fig. 2A for the POPC bilayers, is then due to the trapped counter ion 
osmotic pressure, and is indeed similar to that between two bare mica surfaces across water 
(fig. S2, Extended Data ). At strong compression and lipid -lipid contact (D ≈ 10 nm for the 
POPC bilayers and D ≈ 20 nm for the DSPC liposome layers), the counte rions, which are 
predominantly hydrated protons for the case of water with no -added -salt, will be pushed 
through the lipid layers to the lipid -substrate interface. In the case of the mica, they will 
condense to neutralize the mica surface, as long known63, while in the case of the gold 
surface, which at these separations is still negatively charged54 they will neutralize the  37 residual negative charge density on the gold. Thus both surfaces will be net neutral and the 
electric field E across the lipid -lipid layers will be zero.  
 
For the other (more interesting) case, i .e. at app = + 200 mV, where gold = +105 mV , the 
gold surface at large D will have a positive surface charge density gold, ∞ which we may 
estimate from the Grahame equation eq (M3) using the same fit parameters as in fig. S2, as 
gold,  ∞ = 2.76  mC/m2. As the surfaces approach, counterions will be released in oppositely -
charged pairs to maintain electroneutrality (leading to the long -ranged attraction as seen in 
fig. 2A) until contact is made between the lipid bilayers at D ≈ 10 nm or 20 nm. At t his 
surface separation, we may assume the gold surface largely retains its distal charge density 
value gold,  ∞. The condition of overall neutrality across the gap then requires the residual 
counterions in bilayer -bilayer contact to exactly neutralize the excess surface charge density 
of the mica, since | mica| > | gold,  ∞|, leaving equal and opposite charge densities with 
magnitude equal to | gold,  ∞| on the opposing surfaces. Thus we may use Gauss’s formula for 
the field E across the lipid bilayers:     
𝐸=𝜎
𝜖0𝜖 
where  = gold,  ∞, 𝜖 = 3 is close to the dielectric constant of the lipid layers (ignoring 
residual water molecules, such as in hydration layers, in the compressed bilayers) and 𝜖0 is 
the dielectric permeability of free space. Using the value s above , we find E = 0.104 V/nm, 
close to the value E = 0.1 V/nm used in the atomistic MD simulations.  
  
6. Surface interactions and lubrication at high bulk salt concentrations (0.1M NaNO 3)  38 When the mica and gold potentials are similar and of the same sign, gold ≈mica,  < 0, co-
ions (NO 3-) and counterions (Na+) are initially expelled from the gap between the surfaces as 
they approach. Upon compression (to D = Dhw) residual Na+ counterions will be trapped 
between the surfaces - by the requirement of overall charge neutrality - to just neutralize the 
negative surface charges, thereby largely eliminating any electric field across the gap. The 
hydrophilic counterions are localized in the aqueous regions of the bilayers at a concentration 
of counterions per unit volume cc/i = a/(4n wvw), where  is the surface charge density of the 
gold and mica surfaces (number of charges/unit area), a and nw are the mean area and the 
mean number of  water molecules per lipid (the factor 4 allowing for the four leaflets in the 
two compressed DSPC liposomes; for the POPC bilayers this factor would be 2), and  vw = 
10-3/([103/mH2O] x Navogadro ) m3 is the volume of a water molecule, where m H2O = 18 gm/mole 
is the molecular weight of a water molecule and N avogadro  = 6 x 1023 is Avogadro’s number. 
Here we ignore the small contribution of the hydration of the counterions themselves. Taking 
 ≈ 5 x 1016 charges/m2 (for a surface charge density 8 mC/m2, derived from the Grahame 
equation for gold =mica,  = - 100 mV)), a = 0.6 nm2 and nw = 12, we find cc/i ≈ 0.03M for 
the counterions in the gap (we note that nw = 12 is a lower bound, so the trapped ion 
concentration is likely to be lower than 0.03M). Since the lipid headgroups and the trapped 
Na+ counterions are both strongly hydrated, we expect friction to  be mediated by the 
hydration lubrication mechanism at the slip planes, and to be low. For the case where the 
mica and gold potentials are similar but of opposite  sign, gold ≈ -mica,  (implying gold is 
positively charged and mica negatively charged), as the surfaces approach both Na+ and NO 3- 
ions will initially be expelled to maintain overall neutrality across the gap. However, we  39 expect that for bulk salt concentration 0.1M NaNO 3, residual counter -ions (both Na+ and 
NO 3-) will remain between the surfaces at a concentration cc/i = a/2n w = 0.03M as before, 
and will screen both surfaces, for the following reason: The counterion release entropy S on 
moving ions (in pairs) from the gap to the bulk is readily shown to be S = -kB.ln(cbulk/cc/i) 
per ion. For low bulk salt concentration, as in fig. 2 where no salt is added to the purified 
water, cbulk is of order 10-5M << cc/i  so that S > 0, favoring c omplete expulsion of the final 
ion pairs from between the oppositely charged surfaces. Overall charge neutrality in the gap 
is then achieved through the opposite charges on the mica and gold surfaces, which by 
Gauss’s law ( Methods  section 5) result in a la rge field across the gap. However, at high salt 
cbulk  = 0.1M > cc/i ≤ 0.03M, so that S < 0 and residual ions remain between the surfaces as 
it is entropically (and therefore energetically) unfavorable for them to escape the gap. These 
residual ions (Na+ and NO 3-) effectively screen the charges on the mica and gold so that there 
is no field across the gap, and thus no poration or change in the friction at high bulk salt 
concentrations, as observed.  
 
 
7. Areal fraction of water defects   
The area l fraction of water defects is estimated by image segmentation. Then the number of 
pixels with a value corresponding to the darkest shade is counted and divided by the total 
number of pixels of the image  (Figure S4). We concluded with an average of ca. 13% area 
fraction of water defects.  The number of water molecules per POPC molecule nw is then 
evaluated using the following equation:  𝑛w=𝑛w(𝑝=0)+𝑝
1−𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑙 𝐻0𝜌w/(𝑚H2ONAvogadro ),  40 where p is the water defect area ratio, 𝑛w(𝑝=0)=12,𝑎𝑝𝑙 =0.62 nm2 is the area per lipid 
evaluated from the equilibrium state of the 𝑛w=12 double -bilayer simulation under zero 
electric field,  𝐻0=5 nm is the thickness of a monolayer, 𝜌w is the water density . An areal 
ratio of 13% for the water defects corresponds to a mean hydration level of 20 water/lipid.  
 
8. MD simulation method   
Electroporation of membrane -only systems . The simulation parameters were adopted from 
existing lipid electroporation MD simulation studies 30-32,64,65. The initial simulation system 
comprises two 1 -palmitoyl -2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayers with 128 lipids per 
monolayer leaflet and with two hydration levels of nw = 12 and nw = 20. We used the TIP3P 
water model  with the OH -bonds constrained with SETTLE 66,67. We used the CHARMM36 
all-atom lipids with b ond lengths constrained using the LINCS algorithm  68,69. Lennard -Jones 
interactions were cut off at 1.0 nm. The long-range electrostatic interactions were treated with 
the particle -mesh-Ewald (PME) method 70,71. All simulations were executed  with the 
GROMACS package. The system was first equilibrated in a NPT  ensemble  with dt = 2 fs. A 
velocity -rescaling thermostat was applied with T  = 298 K and a time constant of 0.1 ps. 
Berendsen barostat was applied with anisotropic pressure -coupling, where Px,y  = 1 bar and 
Pz  =  10 bars, similar to the experimental condition . The system is first equilibrated for 100 
ns at zero electric field.  To ge nerate a stable electropore, we followed the conventional 
protocol of applying a high electric field of 0.5 V/nm normal to the membrane  using the 
direct  electric field method  then treating the membrane with E = 0.1  V/nm which is 
equilibrate d until the area per lipid and pore radius plateau 38,72 -74. This procedure is to  41 accommodate the limited computational time of O(1) s at maximum, whereas in the 
experiments, pores take longer time to form under the low electric fields.  
 
Charge -imbalance simulations with solid slabs. The membrane -only structures of nw = 12 
and nw = 20 equilibrated at an electric field of 0.1 V/nm were equilibrated again after the 
addition of the solid phase. Solid slabs of mica and gold (111), both generated using the 
CHARMM -GUI generator based on INTERFACE FF 75, were placed respectively above and 
below the equilibrated membranes. The th ickness of both solid slabs is 2 nm, which was 
tested to be sufficiently rigid under the applied pressure. The area of the solid slabs matches 
that of the porated membranes with an unavoidable areal difference of 3%. Finally, vacuum 
space was added to the top and bottom of the structure to reduce interaction between the solid 
phases across the periodic boundary. We transferred potassium ions from randomly scattered 
positions at the inner mica surface to the inner surface of gold to match the experimental 
condition of a surface charge density of 8 mC/m2. During the equilibrium simulations, 
positions of the gold surface and the potassium ions are fixed in z to maintain charge 
imbalance, and a pressure of 10 atm is exerted on the gold. This protocol is designed such 
that the increase in cross -section area due to poration is not artificially altered when the non -
stretchable solid phases are incorporated, while the charge -imbalance treatment imposed is 
consistent with the electr ic field previously imposed to the membrane -only system.  
  42 Shearing simulation s of membranes with planar solid confinement.  The cross -section 
area is fixed under the NVT ensemble. The mica surface is fixed in all three directions using 
the freeze group opti on. The potassium ions on the gold surface are fixed in z. The y 
coordinates of the gold surface are fixed to prevent lateral sliding. A harmonic potential with 
a force constant of 1000 kJ/(mol∙nm2 ) was applied to the center of mass of the gold slab, 
pulling the gold slab at constant velocities in the x-direction.  
Further details are given in refs. 25 and 24. 
 
 
9. Interfacial energy dissipation on translation  
The interfacial energy dissipation E over a sliding translation in the x-direction for  two 
smooth, flat surfaces in contact via an interfacial layer over an area A( x), under a mean 
contact pressure P( x), is given by E =∫(𝑥,𝑑𝑥/𝑑𝑡).A(𝑥).P(𝑥).d𝑥𝑥
 , where  is an effective  
friction coefficient . Since the other parameters are either geometrical (A) or external 
constraints (P),  thus serves as  a proxy for quantification of the interfacial energy dissipation  
reflecting changes in the interfacial layer itself .

Determination of mica surface charge density and the gold surface potential  
The mica surface potential is estimated by fitting normal force Fn(D)/R profiles measured 
using the dynamic approach, between two identical mica surfaces across pure water using the 
Derjaguin -Landau -Vervey -Overbeek (DLVO) expression (equation S2)59:

where c is the ion concentration, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (296 K), 
AH is the relevant mica -water -mica Hamaker constant (=2× 10-20 J)60, Ψmica,  is the far -field 
(D→∞) mica surface potential, κ-1 is the Debye length ( =√𝜖0𝜖r𝑘B𝑇2𝑒2𝑐 ⁄  for 1:1 electrolyte , 
𝜖0 and 𝜖r are the dielectric constant of vacuum and relative dielectric constant of media) and 
e is the electron charge. Typical  Fn(D)/R profiles using this approach are shown in fig. S2. The 
parameters , mica surface potential Ψmica,  and ion concentration c are ext racted from the fit. 
The mica surface charge densi ty smica is then calculated using the Grahame equation (Equation 
S3): 
𝜎mica =√8𝑐𝜖0𝜖r𝑘B𝑇sinh (𝑒𝛹mica
2𝑘B𝑇)                 (S3) 
The gold surface potentials Ψgold relative to the bulk at different applied potentials Ψapp 
are extracted by fitting the normal force profiles Fn(D)/R between bare gold and mica surface 
in water (Fig . 1B in main text), using the 1D Poisson -Boltzmann equation ( S4, where x is the 
distance f rom the surface, Ψ is the potential) with constant surface charge density (mica) versus 
constant surface potential (gold) boundary conditions61, and with the van der Waals term -
AH/6D2 (AH=9×10-20 J62). The mica surface charge density σmica, ion concentration c, and  44 temperature T (=296 K) are independently known (see above), yielding the gold surface 
potential Ψgold as the only fitting parameter.

Evaluation of the mean contact pressure  
The radius a of the contact area between a sphere, radius R, and a flat (the effective 
geometry of the crossed -cylindrical surfaces in the SFB) under a load Fn is a = (FnR/K)1/3, 
according to the Hertzian contact model60, where K is their effective modulus (essentially that 
of the glue layer attaching the opposing gold and mica surfaces to the lenses). The mean 
effective modulus K is extracted from two indepe ndent measurements of the flattening – at the 
tips of the optical fringes 50 – at known loads ( table S1), while R ≈ 1 cm is the mean radius of 
curvature, measured separately for each exper iment50. The mean pressure over the contact area 
is then evaluated as 𝑃=𝐹n
𝜋𝑎2 ⁄ =𝐹n1/3𝐾2/3

Estimating the electric field across the membrane -water systems  
We consider the field in the two cases: at Ψapp = -300 mV, when the gold potential, Ygold 
is large and negative ( Ψgold  = - 103 mV, from fig. 1B), and at Ψapp = + 200 mV, when Ψgold  
is large and positive  ( Ψgold  = + 105 mV, from fig. 1B), as follows. In the first case, Ψgold < 
0, the surface charge density σgold on the gold surface at large D is negative; likewise the 
opposing mica surface is negatively charged (a fixed charge density due to loss of K+ ions as 
noted in the main text), which from the force  profiles in fig. S2 may be evaluated as σmica = -
5.24 mC/m2. As the two lipid -bearing charged surfaces approach, excess counterions will be  45 trapped in the gap between them to neutralize the charges on both surfaces. The resulting 
repulsion, as seen in fig . 2A for the POPC bilayers, is then due to the trapped counterion 
osmotic pressure, and is indeed similar to that between two bare mica surfaces across water 
(fig. S2). At strong compression and lipid -lipid contact ( D ≈ 10 nm for the POPC bilayers and 
D ≈ 20 nm for the DSPC liposome layers), the counterions, which are predominantly hydrated 
protons for the case of water with no -added -salt, will be pushed through the lipid layers to the 
lipid-substrate interface. In the case of the mica, they will condense t o neutralize the mica 
surface, as long known63, while in the case of the gold surface, which at these separations is 
still negatively charged54 they will neutralize the residual negative charge density on the gold. 
Thus both surfaces will be net neutral and the electric field E across the lipid -lipid layers will 
be zero.  
For the other (more interesting) case, i.e. at app = + 200 mV, where gold = +105 mV , 
the gold surface at large D will have a positive surface charge density gold, ∞ which we may 
estimate from the Grahame equation eq (S3) using the same fit parameters as in fig. S2, as 
gold,  ∞ = 2.76  mC/m2. As the surfaces approach, counterions will be released in oppositely -
charged pairs to maintain electroneutrality (leading to the  long-ranged attraction as seen in fig. 
2A) until contact is made between the lipid bilayers at D ≈ 10 nm or 20 nm. At this surface 
separation, we may assume the gold surface largely retains its distal charge density value gold,  ∞. 
The condition of overal l neutrality across the gap then requires the residual counterions in 
bilayer -bilayer contact to exactly neutralize the excess surface charge density of the mica, since 
|mica| > |gold,  ∞|, leaving equal and opposite charge densities with magnitude equal to |gold,  ∞|  46 on the opposing surfaces. Thus we may use Gauss’s formula (eq. S5). for the field E across the 
lipid bilayers:  
𝐸=𝜎
𝜖0𝜖            (S5) 
where  = gold,  ∞, 𝜖 = 3 is close to the dielectric constant of the lipid layers (ignoring residual 
water molecules, such as in hydration layers, in the compressed bilayers) and 𝜖0 is the 
dielectric permeability of free space. Using the values above , we find E = 0.104 V/nm, close 
to the value E = 0.1 V/nm used in the atomistic MD simulations.  
 
Surface interactions and lubrication at high bulk salt concentrations (0.1M NaNO 3) 
When the mica and gold potentials are similar and of the same sign, Ψgold ≈Ψmica,  < 0, co -ions 
(NO 3-) and counterions (Na+) are initially expelled from the gap between the surfaces as they 
approach. Upon compression (to D = Dhw) residual Na+ counterions will be trapped between 
the surfaces - by the requirement of overall charge neutrality - to just neutr alize the negative 
surface charges, thereby largely eliminating any electric field across the gap. The hydrophilic 
counterions are localized in the aqueous regions of the bilayers at a concentration of 
counterions per unit volume cc/i= σa/(4nwvw), where σ is the surface charge density of the gold 
and mica surfaces (number of charges/unit area), a and nw are the mean area and the mean 
number of water molecules per lipid (the factor 4 allowing for the four leaflets in the two 
compressed DSPC liposomes; for th e POPC bilayers this factor would be 2), and  vw=10-
3/([103/mH2O]×Navogadro ) m3 is the volume of a water molecule, where mH2O = 18 g/mol is the 
molecular weight of a water molecule and Navogadro  = 6×1023 is Avogadro’s number. Here we 
ignore the small contribution of the hydration of the counterions themselves. Taking σ ≈ 5×1016  47 charges/m2 (for a surface charge density 8 mC/m2, derived from the Grahame equation for 
Ψgold=Ψmica, = -100 mV)), a = 0.6 nm2 and nw = 12, we find cc/i ≈ 0.03M for the counterions in 
the gap (we note that nw = 12 is a lower bound, so the trapped ion concentration is likely to be 
lower than 0.03M). Since the lipid headgroups and the trapped Na+ counterions are both 
strongly hydrated, we expect friction to be mediated by the hydration lubrication mechanism 
at the slip planes, and to be low. For the case where the mica and gold potentials are similar 
but of opposite sign, Ψgold ≈ -Ψmica,  (implying gold is positively charged and mica negatively 
charged), as the surfaces approach both Na+ and NO 3- ions will initia lly be expelled to maintain 
overall neutrality across the gap. However, we expect that for bulk salt concentration 0.1M 
NaNO 3, residual counter -ions (both Na+ and NO 3-) will remain between the surfaces at a 
concentration cc/i = σa/2nw = 0.03M as before, and will screen both surfaces, for the following 
reason: The counterion release entropy ΔS on moving ions (in pairs) from the gap to the bulk 
is readily shown to be ΔS = -kBln(cbulk/cc/i) per ion. For low bulk salt concentration, as in fig. 2 
where no salt is added to the purified water, cbulk is of order 10-5M << cc/i so that ΔS > 0, 
favoring complete expulsion of the final ion pairs from between the oppositely charged surfaces. 
Overall charge neutrality in the gap is then achieved thro ugh the opposite charges on the mica 
and gold surfaces, which by Gauss’s law ( eq. S5 ) result in a large field across the gap. However, 
at high salt cbulk = 0.1M > cc/i ≤ 0.03M, so that ΔS < 0 and residual ions remain between the 
surfaces as it is entropica lly (and therefore energetically) unfavorable for them to escape the 
gap. These residual ions (Na+ and NO 3-) effectively screen the charges on the mica and gold so 
that there is no field across the gap, and thus no poration or change in the friction at hig h bulk 
salt concentrations, as observed.   48  
Areal fraction of water defects  
The area l fraction of water defects is estimated by image segmentation. Then the number of 
pixels with a value corresponding to the darkest shade is counted and divided by the total 
number of pixels of the image  (fig. S4). We concluded with an average of ca. 13% ar ea fraction 
of water defects.  The number of water molecules per POPC molecule nw is then evaluated using 
the following equation:  𝑛w=𝑛w(𝑝=0)+𝑝
1−𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑙 𝐻0𝜌w/(𝑚H2O𝑁Avogadro ), where p is the 
water defect area ratio, 𝑛w(𝑝=0)=12,𝑎𝑝𝑙 =0.62 nm2 is the a rea per lipid evaluated from 
the equilibrium state of the 𝑛w=12 double -bilayer simulation under zero electric field,  
𝐻0=5 nm is the thickness of a monolayer, 𝜌w is the water density . An areal ratio of 13% for 
the water defects corresponds to a mean hydration level of 20 water/lipid.
