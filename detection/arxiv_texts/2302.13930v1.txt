Niobium nitride (NbN) is a particularly promising material for quantum technology applications,
as entails the degree of reproducibility necessary for large-scale of superconducting circuits. We
demonstrate that resonators based on NbN thin lms present a one-photon internal quality fac-
tor above 105maintaining a high impedance (larger than 2k
), with a footprint of approximately
50100m2and a self-Kerr nonlinearity of few tenths of Hz. These quality factors, mostly limited
by losses induced by the coupling to two-level systems, have been maintained for kinetic induc-
tances ranging from tenths to hundreds of pH/ . We also demonstrate minimal variations in the
performance of the resonators during multiple cooldowns over more than nine months. Our work
proves the versatility of niobium nitride high{kinetic inductance resonators, opening perspectives to-
wards the fabrication of compact, high{impedance and high{quality multimode circuits, with sizable
interactions.
I. INTRODUCTION
The possibility of tuning the magnitude of the in-
ductance in superconducting circuits is paramount to
achieve the high-degree of control and exibility required
for quantum technology [1]. Two platforms have been
mostly used to achieve high values of inductance: ar-
rays of Josephson junctions (JJs) [2{5] or high{kinetic
inductance disordered thin lms [6, 7]. JJ devices are
characterized by very low dissipation rates, and for this
reason they are routinely used in circuit quantum electro-
dynamics (cQED) [8, 9]. Usually, JJ-based circuits still
exhibit large nonlinearities. To dilute such nonlinearity
suited for applications such as quantum{limited paramet-
ric ampliers, arrays of JJs sacrice compactness and add
fabrication overhead [10, 11].
Kinetic inductance is a promising novel resource for
quantum technology [11{14]. For instance, supercon-
ducting high{kinetic inductance (high{ Lk) thin lms
have been used for several cryogenic applications, rang-
ing from detectors [13, 15, 16] to ampliers [14, 17], and
lters [18, 19]. In dirty superconductor thin lms, the in-
ductance depends on the Cooper pairs carrier density [6],
and it can be tuned by controlling the chemical composi-
tion of the lms during the deposition. From a cQED per-
spective, the advantages of high{ Lkare manifold. Thin
E-mail: simone.frasca@ep.chlms give the designers the freedom to operate with low{
or high{impedance, and thus a higher range of achiev-
able capacitive-coupling between dierent circuital ele-
ments [20]. In turn, this allows exploring several regimes
of light-matter interaction, from the strong to more ex-
otic ultrastrong couplings [21, 22]. Given the compact
nature of high{ Lklm resonators, thin lms can reduce
the dimensions of both readout and control apparatus,
and facilitate the realization of many-modes quantum de-
vices [23]. Key to the success of this technology within a
quantum framework is attaining regimes of low internal
losses, where long coherence times can be maintained.
Many disordered superconductors have shown high{
kinetic inductance, e.g., NbN [23, 24], NbTiN [14, 17, 25],
and TiN [26], or materials composed by microscopic eec-
tive Josephson arrays such as the emergent granular Alu-
minum (grAl) [27]. Several groups manufactured weakly-
disordered thin lms that present considerable quality
factors [26, 28]. Consequently, thin lms with moderate
Lkproved useful for quantum computing tasks [29], in
particular for optical communication [30], quantum key
distribution [31, 32], and quantum teleportation [33].
Large-scale quantum applications will, however, also
require a wide range of Lktunability and high control and
reproducibility of the superconducting building blocks.
In this work, we demonstrate that we fully control the
kinetic inductance of NbN lms (from 30 to 170 pH =),
maintaining a very-high resonator quality in excess of 105
at low photon number, with a high and reliable degree of
reproducibility. We identify the saturable two-level sys-arXiv:2302.13930v1  [quant-ph]  27 Feb 20232

lifetime [34]. Furthermore, our devices show no signi-
cant lm degradation (ageing) over the course of dierent
cooldowns nine months apart.
II. DEVICE DESIGN AND FABRICATION
We fabricate planar lumped LC resonators etch-
ing 13 nm-thick NbN lm, with typical impedance
Z=p
Lr=Crof 2 k
, where LrandCrare inductance
and capacitance of the resonator respectively. The fab-
rication begins with a 2 minutes dip in 40% HF bath to
remove the native oxide and possible contamination from
the surface of an intrinsic, high{resistivity ( 10k
cm),
h100i{oriented 100 mm Si wafers. There follows an NbN
lms bias sputtering [35] at room temperature in a Keno-
sistec RF sputtering system. After subsequent deposition
of Ti/Pt alignment markers by optical lift-o process and
dehydration step at 150C for 5 minutes, 80 nm-thick
CSAR positive e-beam resist is spin coated at 4000 rpm
on the wafer, and baked at 150C for 5 minutes. With
an electron beam lithography (Raith EBPG5000+ at
100 keV) step, the devices are patterned on the resist
through development in amyl acetate for 1 minute, fol-
lowed by rinsing in a solution 9:1 MiBK:IPA. The pat-
tern is then transferred to the NbN using CF 4/Ar mix-
ture and reactive ion etching with a power of 15 W for 5
minutes. The resist is stripped by means of Microposit
remover 1165 heated at 70C. Finally, the wafer is coated
with 1.5 m AZ ECI 3007 positive photolithography re-
sist for devices protection and diced.
The advantages of bias sputtering [35], i.e., applica-
tion of a RF bias voltage on the substrate, resides in ionbombardment during the lm deposition, which causes
a reduction of superconducting critical temperature and
grain size, permitting the deposition of a polycrystalline
material. The polycrystallinity improves the supercon-
ductor homogeneity and it eases the device realization.
The lm behaves as an amorphous material with respect
to etching procedures, and simultaneously maintains the
advantageous properties of crystalline superconductors.
For example, the low electron{phonon interaction time
is barely changed, with important repercussions, such
as enhanced maximum count rate in superconducting
single{photon detectors [35]. To optimize the lms prop-
erties, we ne-tune the nitrogen to argon partial pressures
in the chamber across several fabrication runs, with pres-
sure and substrate bias chosen to give the lest roughness
in the lms. These steps also improve the reproducibility
and yield of the samples.
III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
After the fabrication, we glue the chips on a cop-
per support with PMMA and wire-bond it to a cus-
tomized printed circuit board. The copper support is
then mounted on the cold nger installed at the mixing
chamber stage of a BlueFors LD250 dilution refrigerator
at a base temperature of 10 mK, see Fig. 1(a).
In order to test multiple devices in a single cooldown
and to increase the experimental throughput, the de-
vices are connected in transmission conguration through
cryogenically operating coaxial switches (Radiall, R573
series), sharing both input and output lines [see
Fig. 1(a)].

 coplanar transmission line, as
Fig. 1 (b). The output line is connected to two cryogenic
insulators (Low Noise Factory, LNF-ISISC4-8A series)
to attenuate thermal noise injection from the amplier,
and a cryogenic low{noise amplier (Low Noise Factory,
LNF-LNC4-8C series) operating at the 4 K stage of the
cryostat. Input and output lines are then connected at
room temperature to a Vector Network Analyzer (Ro-
hde & Schwarz, ZNA26 series) to acquire the scattering
parameters.
The notch (or hanger [36]) conguration of resonators
has been chosen for a precise estimation of the internal
quality factor of the devices { they self-calibrate with
respect to the transmission baseline { and it allows fre-
quency multiplexing [36]. Moreover, the microwave feed-
line can be probed in DC to estimate the resistance{
temperature characteristic curve and the critical temper-
atureTC. The latter has been measured with a closed
loop cryostat (PhotonSpot inc.) with 800 mK base tem-
perature.TABLE I: Measured and estimated main parameters

Fig. 2 reports TCandLk(T), both measured and es-
timated according to Eq. (1), as a function of the N 2
ow during the spattering deposition. The deposition
conditions, critical temperatures, sheet resistance, esti-
mated kinetic inductance, and critical current density
jcof the thin lms are reported in Tab. I. Increasing
the N 2concentration in the lms causes an increment
of impurities embedded in the lms during the sputter-
ing process. At low N 2, we notice a raise in the critical
temperature. While also the resistivity increases, the ra-
tio between these two in Eq. (1) does not compensate,
causing a little drop in Lkin the proximity of the sto-
chiometric condition, which for this deposition setting
are found approximately at 2.5 sccm N 2ux. Larger N 2
concentration increases the lm disorder, causing a raise
of lm resistivity and a drop of critical temperature, both
boosting the kinetic inductance.4

B. Internal quality factor and Kerr nonlinearity
We model each cavity as a Kerr nonlinear resonator,
described by the Hamiltonian:

where ^a(^ay) is the bosonic creation (annihilation) opera-
tor,!0is the resonant frequency of the cavity, and Kthe
Kerr nonlinearity. These devices are also characterized
by photon loss events, whose rate is given by ( +),
withthe external coupling and the internal losses.
The resonator is driven at a frequency !dof intensity
Pin.
For our devices, we measure the transmitted power S21
of the resonator hanged to the feedline. To extract the
parameters of a Kerr resonator in hanger conguration,
we use input{output theory [37], and obtain:

numbern, and on other internal parameters of the res-
onator that can be independently measured, as detailed
in Appendix B. As it will be detailed later, the inter-
nal dissipation rate has a nontrivial power dependence.
Hence, we perform power scans of the devices to be able
to estimate the total loss rate ( +) with respect to
the average number of photons in the resonator hnphi.We rst estimate the resonator frequency !0, as it cor-
responds to the dip in frequency of S21in the low-power
regime. Then, to retrieve ,andK, we use a global t
routine at all powers, to increase the accuracy of the ex-
trapolated values. In the linear regime at low-power, we
also benchmark our results for andusing the python
package by Probst et al. [38], nding no signicant dis-
crepancies with respect to our routine.
In order to precisely estimate the internal quality fac-
tor and reduce t uncertainty, it is more convenient to
approach a critical coupling condition , where the
internal quality factor approximately matches the exter-
nal coupling [36]. As the internal quality factor is not
known a priori, we take full advantage of notch congu-
ration to engineer multiple couplings for devices on the
same chip. Fourteen hanger resonators are fabricated per
each lm, seven with inductor width of 250 nm and seven
with inductor width of 500 nm. In Fig. 3 we present the
measured and tted transmitted power S21using Eq. (3)
through the feedline for one of the critically coupled res-
onators as a function of the probe frequency and for sev-
eral input powers.
Figure 4(a) reports the extracted quality factors of
the 105 tested resonators in the linear regime (for Kerr-
induced frequency shift much smaller than the resonator
line width). The datapoints represent the averaged in-
ternal quality factor estimated for the seven resonators

onators]. The error bars represent the standard devia-

deriving from the global t of each resonator, although
we notice that they are negligible with respect to the
parameter spreading due to fabrication.
To quantify the self-Kerr nonlinearity Kwe reach
regimes of large photon numbers, where the eect of the
nonlinearity is comparable to the resonator linewidth.
In Fig. 4(b), we reported the measured Kof the criti-
cally coupled tested resonators ( ) for each lm and
width. The data for the resonators with 500 nm (250 nm)
wide inductor are shown with triangles (circles). The self-
Kerr nonlinearity increases with Lk, with a clear oset
between the two inductor widths, as also reported in [24].

both kinetic inductance and inductor width, we plot in

C. Origin of the internal dissipation
All devices, except the ones with the highest Lk, show
Qiaround 105in the single-photon regime. For the de-vices with the largest Lk= 170 pH/ , we argue that
the nitrogen concentration of the lm is approaching the
limiting value of the superconductor{normal metal tran-
sition (SNT) [39]. This argument is corroborated by the
observation that the resonators with 250 nm wide induc-
tors did not exhibit any superconducting transition while
reaching base temperature, while the w= 500 nm devices
show a lower internal quality factor in the range of 104at
single photon regime. These 170 pH/ resonators, how-
ever, present Qiin excess of 105at a thousand photon
number, in line with the other lms, suggesting that the
dissipation can be mainly attributed to two-level system
(TLS) hosted in highly disordered lms [36, 40]. While
TLS nature is still unclear, it is believed to be related to
atoms tunneling between two sites of a disordered solid
[41{43].
In order to describe the various mechanisms contribut-
ing to the internal quality factor as a function of input
power, we write [23, 34, 44]:

The second contribution is due to TLS, which according
to the TLS model [43] generates a power and temperature
dependent resonator loss. Here, Fis dened as the ll-

sentative resonators of dierent lms, close to critical
coupling conditions, , as a function of the pho-

nd that the TLS contribution dominates the internal
quality factor. We report the value of F0

tained from the ts in Tab. II. Comparing them to what
previously found in [23, 46], we nd similar tting values
for the exponent , close to 0.2 for all the tested devices.
However, as reported in Tab. II, the characteristic pho-
ton number of TLS saturation, nc, is estimated to range
between 30 and 100, a much larger value than the one re-
ported for similar lms in NbN [23], which we attribute
to a discrepancy in the photon number expressions [see
Eq. (B5), in accordance with [46]].To further show the dominance of TLS, we investigated
the resonator's quality factor evolution at dierent oper-
ating temperatures. The cryostat was slowly warmed up
from a base temperature of 15 mK to a temperature of
almost 1 K in a controlled way, and the resonator spec-
trum was acquired at hnphi50. The evolution of the
extracted internal quality factor Qiand resonator reso-
nant frequency !0are reported in Fig. 6(a).
In addition, we characterize the contribution of the
TLS and quasiparticle using the frequency shift of the
resonators at dierent temperatures [see Fig. 6(b)]. In-
deed, we have that [34]:

TLS uctuators, while at larger temperatures, the quasi-
particles induced shift dominates.
D. Ageing characterization
Finally, to address the problem of thin lms ageing, in
particular the eect of the niobium oxide native layer on
the internal quality factor [48{50], the devices were tested
after nine months from the initial measurements, and
in the same exact conguration. The devices were kept
wire-bonded to the PCBs and were stored in a controlled
N2atmosphere. We observed a systematic dip frequency
shift of about  fageranging between 3 and 5 MHz [seeTab. II] towards lower frequency for all the measured
resonators. In Fig. 5 are collected the power scans of
the internal quality factors of the tested resonators, with
respect to average number of photons, measured right
after fabrication [in blue] and after nine months [in red].
While for the low- Lkdevices the quality factor dropped
slightly due to ageing, for larger Lklms this eect is less
pronounced, with the internal quality factor remaining
almost unchanged after nine months. All the resonators
remain, however, dominated by coupling to TLS, with
internal quality factors at large number of photons in
the excess of 105.
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated high ( Qi>105) internal qual-
ity factor, high{kinetic inductance superconducting res-
onators operating at single-photon regime based on NbN
thin lms superconductor. The NbN was bias-sputtered
to increase kinetic inductance and device yield due to
its poly-crystalline nature, at the expenses of a reduced
critical temperature.
Both stochiometric and non-stochiometric NbN lms
were deposited by varying atmospheric deposition con-
ditions. After characterizing the deposition rates, lms
of equal thickness of 13 nm were sputtered. We fabri-
cated and characterized 105 compact LC resonators mul-
tiplexed in hanger conguration and with kinetic induc-
tance ranging from 30 pH/ to 170 pH/ , as shown
in Fig. 7(a). While for low photon number the internal
quality factor presents a slight dependence from kinetic
inductance, at high photon numbers the resonators qual-8

ity factors approach 106, suggesting a clear TLS induced
loss mechanism.
By tting the high{power scattering parameter of the
resonators we also estimate the self-Kerr nonlinearity K
for the dierent tested lms. Qualitatively, as depicted
in Fig. 7(b), we observe a linear dependence of Kwith
respect toLk. The sel-Kerr K, being below 100 Hz, is
about four orders of magnitude lower than that of res-
onators made with Josephson junctions arrays [51].
In conclusion, the results show a clear dominance of
TLS{induced losses across the board, with lower kinetic{
inductance lms having larger internal quality factors,
lower self-Kerr nonlinearity and less robustness with re-
spect to ageing eects. The overall performance make
the technology particularly appealing for those applica-
tions relying on low{nonlinearity, high{quality factor and
large average photon number, such as parametric ampli-
ers, readout resonators, and photon detectors.

Appendix A: Estimation of kinetic inductance
The kinetic inductance of the lms was estimated both
using classical BCS theory and via Sonnet simulations,
by simulating the resonant frequency of the tested chips
and comparing it to the measured value at low photon
number.
The chip designs were slightly dierent for the various
lms, to have the resonant frequencies of the devices in
the same frequency range, and to ensure low reections
by matching as much as possible the microwave feedline
to a 50 
 impedance line. We used overall ve designs.
For each design, we simulated three resonators with
Sonnet to estimate their resonant frequency at three dif-
ferent sheet kinetic inductivity values Ls, see Fig. 8(a).
Given that the resonator capacitance remains constant,
the resonant frequency should follow a !0/1=pLkde-
pendence. By plotting the hyperbola passing through
these three points, as shown in Fig. 8(b), it is possible, by
measuring at low photon number the resonant frequency
of the resonator under test !0=2, to estimate the ki-
netic inductance of the lm. To increase the robustness
of such method, we average the obtained Lkfor the three
resonators [see Fig. 8], allowing us to reduce even further
the uncertainty associated to the kinetic inductivity of
the lms.9

Measuring the resonant frequency of each of the three simulated devices, it is possible to extract the kinetic
inductivity of the superconducting lm as the average of the three Lsvalues.
Appendix B: Equations derivation
The transmission spectra from the main feedline was
measured at dierent input power. The nonlinear eects
of the kinetic inductance of the lm, produces an eective
Kerr behavior of the resonators (see Fig. 3).
The nonlinear Kerr Hamiltonian for superconducting
resonators can be written as [24]:
