PAOLO LIPPARINI
Abstract. We devise exact conditions under which a join semilattice wi th
a weak contact relation can be semilattice embedded into a Bo olean algebra
with an overlap contact relation, equivalently, into a dist ributive lattice with
additive contact relation. A similar characterization is p roved with respect to
Boolean algebras and distributive lattices with weak conta ct, not necessarily
additive, nor overlap.
1.Introduction
Contact algebras are Boolean algebras endowed with a further con tact binary
relation; they play an important role in region-based theory of spac e. Indeed, the
theory of contact algebras can be seen as a very general ﬁrst-order theory intended
to model topological properties of regions [1, Sect. 4]. Contact algebras can also
be seen as a point-free algebraization of proximities, a useful gene ralization of the
notion of topology [1, 5, 13]. Contact algebras and generalizations h ave been used
to provide a logical calculus for compact Hausdorﬀ spaces [2] and ha ve applications
to the study of nonstandard rules in modal logics [3]. See the quote d sources for
more references and details.
D¨ untsch, MacCaull, Vakarelovand Winter [7] proposeto drop the n otion ofcom-
plement, thus considering contact distributive lattices. More radic ally, Ivanova [10]
provides arguments suggesting the naturalness of contact join- semilattices, namely,
to consider only join, but not complementation, neither meet. In a n utshell, if a
is a region of space, its complement is possibly not well-deﬁned, since it is depen-
dent on the universe in which we consider a. Moreover, if one considers large but
limited regions of space, both complementation and meet might turn o ut to be
inappropriate.
Parallel arguments in favor of the use of the join operation only are presented in
[11]. In [11] we proposed the project of detecting which topological properties are
preserved “covariantly” by image functions associated to continu ous maps. This is
more close to intuition than the present-day customary way of wor king contravari-
antly, say, describingcontinuity in terms ofpreservationofopenn ess throughpreim-
ages. Indeed, as already stressed by K. Kuratowski, a function b etween topological
spacesis continuousif and only if it preservesthe adherencerelatio n between points
and subsets. Contact between subsets is preserved, as well, by im age functions as-
sociated to continuous maps, if we deﬁne two subsets xandyto be in contact
whenKx∩Ky/\e}atio\slash=∅, whereKdenotes closure (this is a basic example of what in a
topological context is called a proximity [5]). We refer to [11] for more details. As

far as the emphasis on join semilattices here is concerned, notice th at iff→is the
image function from P(X) toP(Y) associated to some function f:X→Y, then
f→preserves unions but not necessarily intersections or complement s.
At a very elementary level, the use of the join operation alone is also s uggested
by the fact that it is the only operation appearing in the axioms for an additive
contact relation; see Deﬁnition 2.1 below. As another advantage, r epresentation
theorems for semilattices generally do not need the axiom of choice. See Remark
4.2, as far as the results presented here are concerned.
A weak deﬁnition of contact in a semilattice guarantees that the sem ilattice can
be embedded into a complete lattice, which can be chosen to have ove rlap contact
[12, Theorem 4(b)]. On the other hand, the deﬁnition is too weak to g uaranteethat
acontact semilatticecan be embedded into aweakcontact distributive lattice. Here
we ﬁnd necessary and suﬃcient conditions under which the above em beddability
can be obtained. This is also equivalent to being embeddable into a weak contact
Boolean algebra, which can be chosen to be atomic and complete. See Theorem
4.1.
Moreover, we show in Theorem 3.2 that embeddability into an additive c on-
tact distributive lattice is equivalent to embeddability into a Boolean alg ebra with
overlap contact. Thus, as far as weak contact distributive lattices are concerned,
additivity alone is enoughto guaranteesemilattice embeddability into Booleanalg e-
braswith overlapcontact1. Theorem3.2 alsoprovidesan equivalent axiomatization
forContact join-semilattices in the sense of [10]. See Corollary 3.4. This conﬁrms
the usefulness of the notion of a Contact join-semilattice. On the o ther hand, The-
orem 4.1 provides a larger class of weak contact semilattices, a class which seems
to be of interest, as well. The two classes are distinct, as we will show in Example
5.2(c).
While, as summarized above, the main emphasis in this note is about ver y “reg-
ular” contact semilattices enjoying particularly good properties an d satisfying re-
ﬁned representation theorems, it is conceivable that also the more general notion
of a weak contact semilattice is interesting and will ﬁnd signiﬁcant app lications in
the future, as already hinted in the ﬁnal section of [8]. There are ea sily constructed
examples which lie beyond the above-described classes: the nondist ributive ﬁve-
element modular lattice M3with overlap contact is not additive. Even if we give
M3an additive contact structure, certain representation theorem s fail. See Ex-
amples 5.2(a)(b). Such examples are interesting since there are ma ny signiﬁcant
examples of nondistributive lattices having various kinds of applicatio ns in many
sciences [14, 16].
In an even more general situation, weak contact relations on pose ts, under dif-
ferent terminology and with entirely diﬀerent motivations, appear a lso asevent
structures in computer science, e. g., [17, Section 8]. See [12, Remark 7] for exp licit
details.

tions of weak contact join-semilattices will be found, in particular, w ith regards
to fragments of logics with neither negation, nor conjunction. As a small logical
application, we use our representation theorems in order to chara cterize the set of
universal consequences of the theory of Boolean algebras with a c ontact relation in
the language of contact semilattices. See Corollary 5.1.
2.Preliminaries and basic definitions
Deﬁnition 2.1. In the present note semilattices are always intended in the sense
of join semilattices with a minimum element 0. The semilattice operation w ill be
denoted by +. In any join semilattice the operation + induces a partia l order≤
deﬁned by a≤bifa+b=b. When we speak of a partial order in a semilattice, we
will always mean the order deﬁned above.
The existence of 0 is assumed only for simplicity. For example, we shall consider
embeddings into Boolean algebras, which indeed have a 0. Were we con sidering
semilattices without 0, we should give distinct deﬁnitions of overlap, a ccording to
the presence or the absence of 0. See Remark 6 in [12] for further details.
Aweak contact relation (orbasic contact relation ) on some poset Swith 0 is a
binary relation δonSsuch that
a δ b⇔b δ a (Sym)
a δ b⇒a >0 &b >0, (Emp)
a δ b&a≤a1&b≤b1⇒a1δ b1, (Ext)
n/\e}atio\slash= 0⇒n δ n, (Ref)
for alln,a,b,c,a 1,b1∈S. We write a/\e}atio\slashδ bto mean that a δ bdoes not hold.
The deﬁnition of a weak contact relation appears in [8], with main empha sis on
lattice-ordered structures. Weak contact relations on posets h ave been studied in
[12].
Aweak contact semilattice is a structure ( S,+,0,δ), where ( S,+,0) is a semi-
lattice with 0 and δis a weak contact relation, as deﬁned above.
The canonical example of a weak contact semilattice is the following. I fSis a
semilattice (or just a poset) with 0, then, setting
(Ove) a δ bif there is n∈S,n >0 such that n≤aandn≤b,
we get a weak contact relation. The relation δdeﬁned in (Ove) is called the overlap
(ortrivial, orminimal) contact relation.
The following property is frequently required in the deﬁnition of a con tact rela-
tion (this is the reason for the terminology including “weak”). An additive contact
relationon some semilattice is a weak contact relation satisfying the following c on-
dition.
a δ b+c⇒a δ bora δ c. (Add)
The overlap contact relation deﬁned in (Ove) does not necessarily s atisfy (Add).
For example, consider δdeﬁned in a 5-element modular lattice with three atoms;
see Example 5.2(a) below. On the other hand, if a semilattice has a dist ributive
lattice order and δis deﬁned by (Ove), then (Add) holds, as well. See Lemma 2.4
below. An additive contact semilattice is a semilattice with an additive contact
relation.4 PAOLO LIPPARINI
We will consider the following properties of a weak contact semilattice S.
For every a,b,c0,c1∈S,ifb≤a+c0, b≤a+c1andc0/\e}atio\slashδ c1,
thenb≤a.(D1)
For every n∈Nanda,b,c1,0,c1,1,...,c n,0,cn,1∈S,
ifc1,0/\e}atio\slashδ c1,1,...,c n,0/\e}atio\slashδ cn,1and, for every f:{1,...,n} → {0,1},
eitherb≤c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n),ora≤c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n),
thenb/\e}atio\slashδ a.(D2)
Remark 2.2.In casen= 0 in (D2) we get an empty set of summands on the right-
hand sides of the inequalities. We assume that an empty sum is evaluat ed to 0.
Thus the case n= 0 in (D2) is a restatement of (Emp).
Moreover, by taking a= 0 and b=c0=c1>0, (D1) implies (Ref). The case
n= 1 of (D2) implies (Ext). The case n= 1 of (D2) implies also (Sym), by taking
c1,1=bandc1,0=a. The case n= 2 in (D2) with c1,0=b,c1,1=a,c2,0=b,
c2,1=canda+cin place of aimplies (Add) (in contrapositive form and with a
andbshifted).
Lemma 2.3. IfSis a weak contact semilattice and Ssatisﬁes(D1), thenSsatisﬁes
the following condition.
(D1+)For every positive n∈Nanda,b,c1,0,c1,1,...,c n,0,cn,1∈S,
ifc1,0/\e}atio\slashδ c1,1, c2,0/\e}atio\slashδ c2,1, ..., c n,0/\e}atio\slashδ cn,1
andb≤a+c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n),for allf:{1,...,n} → {0,1},
thenb≤a.
Proof.By induction on n. (D1) is the special case n= 1 of (D1+).
Suppose that we have proved (D1+) for some speciﬁc n >0 and suppose
that the assumptions of (D1+) are satisﬁed for n+ 1, say, for certain elements
a,b,...,c n+1,0,cn+1,1.
Fromb≤a+c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n)+cn+1,f(n+1), for allf:{1,...,n,n +1} →
{0,1}, we getb≤a+cn+1,0+c1,g(1)+···+cn,g(n), for allg:{1,...,n} → {0,1}.
By applying (D1+) in case nwitha+cn+1,0in place of a, we get b≤a+cn+1,0.
Similarly, b≤a+cn+1,1. Then (D1) (with c0=cn+1,0andc1=cn+1,1) gives
b≤a. /square
The next lemma appears in [8, Lemma 2, item 1].
Lemma 2.4. In a distributive lattice2with overlap contact the contact relation
satisﬁes (Add).
Proof.In a distributive lattice with overlap contact a δ bif and only if ab/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Thus ifa δ b+c, thenab+ac=a(b+c)/\e}atio\slash= 0, hence either ab/\e}atio\slash= 0 orac/\e}atio\slash= 0, thus

3.Embedding contact semilattices into overlap Boolean algeb ras
Deﬁnition 3.1. Anembedding ϕof (weak) contact semilattices is an injective 0-
preserving map which preserves + and such that a δ bif and only if ϕ(a)δ ϕ(b),
for all elements aandbin the domain.

In the following theorems we shall deal with “embeddings” into models with fur-
ther structures, e. g., contact distributive lattices or contact B oolean algebras. By
a slight abuse of terminology, when we say, for example, that a weak contact semi-
latticeScan be embedded into a contact Boolean algebra B, we mean that there
is an embedding from Sto thereductofBin the language of contact semilattices.
Notice that, in the above sense, embeddings are never assumed to preserve meets,
or other structure, apart from the join operation, the 0 and the contact relation.
IfXis a topological space, the contact relation associated to XonP(X) is
deﬁned by a δ bifKa∩Kb/\e}atio\slash=∅, fora,b⊆X. More generally, if Pis a poset with 0
and with a closure operation K, the associated contact relation is deﬁned by a δ b
if there is n∈P,n >0 such that both n≤Kaandn≤Kb.
Theorem 3.2. IfSis a weak contact semilattice, then the following condition s are
equivalent.
(1)Scan be embedded into a Boolean algebra with overlap contact.
(1′)Scan be embedded into a Boolean algebra with additive contact .
(2)Scan be embedded into a distributive lattice with overlap con tact.
(2′)Scan be embedded into an additive contact distributive latti ce.
(3)Ssatisﬁes (D1)and(D2).
(4)Scan be embedded into a complete atomic Boolean algebra with o verlap
contact.
(5)Scan be embedded into the contact semilattice associated to s ome topological
space.
(6)Scan be embedded into the contact semilattice associated to s ome distribu-
tive lattice with additive closure.
N.B.: A weak contact on a Boolean algebra or on a distributive lattice is n ot
necessarily additive: see Example 5.2(c) below. Hence the additivity a ssumption is
necessary in clauses (1′) and (2′). Compare Theorem 4.1 below.
Proof.(1)⇒(1′)⇒(2′) and (1) ⇒(2)⇒(2′) are either trivial or immediate from
Lemma 2.4.
(2′)⇒(3) Suppose that ι:S→Tis an embedding given by (2′) andThas the
structure of a distributive lattice. If a,b,c0,c1∈Sandb≤a+c0,b≤a+c1, then
ι(b)≤ι(a) +ι(c0) andι(b)≤ι(a) +ι(c1), sinceιis a semilattice homomorphism.
SinceTis a distributive lattice, ι(b)≤(ι(a)+ι(c0))(ι(a)+ι(c1)) =ι(a)+ι(c0)ι(c1).
Sinceιis an embedding, then from c0/\e}atio\slashδ c1we getι(c0)/\e}atio\slashδ ι(c1), henceι(c0)ι(c1) = 0,
by (Ext) and (Ref). Thus ι(b)≤ι(a), hence b≤a, sinceιis an embedding. This
proves (D1).
In order to prove (D2), assume for simplicity that the given embedd ing is an
inclusion, thus we can write, say, ain place of ι(a). We ﬁrst give a much simpler
proof of (D2) under the stronger assumption that Tis a distributive lattice with
overlap contact, that is, assuming (2). Assume the hypotheses o f (D2) and assume
that we are in a distributive lattice with overlap contact. From (Ref) , (Ext) and
c1,0/\e}atio\slashδ c1,1, ...,cn,0/\e}atio\slashδ cn,1we getc1,0c1,1= 0, ..., cn,0cn,1= 0. Then, by the
assumptions and distributivity,
(Eq. 1) ab≤/productdisplay
f(c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n)) =c1,0c1,1+···+cn,0cn,1= 0,6 PAOLO LIPPARINI
wherefvaries among all functions from {1,...,n}to{0,1}. Hencea/\e}atio\slashδ b, since, by
assumption, the relation is the overlap contact.
Now we prove (D2) under the assumption that Tis an additive contact dis-
tributive lattice. Assume the hypotheses of (D2) and assume by co ntradiction that
b δ a. If, for some f:{1,...,n} → {0,1}, we have b≤c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n), then
b=bc1,f(1)+···+bcn,f(n), by distributivity. By b δ a, additivity and symmetry
ofδ, we get bci,f(i)δ a, for some i≤n. Hence the counterexample works if we
consider bci,f(i)in place of b. Iterating the argument a ﬁnite number of times,
it is no loss of generality to assume that, for every f:{1,...,n} → {0,1}, if
b≤c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n), thenb≤ci,f(i), for some i≤nwhich depends on f.
Similarly, we can assume the same for a.
Sinceb δ a, thenb >0 anda >0, by (Emp). Given some i≤n, we cannot
have both b≤ci,0andb≤ci,1, by (Ref) and (Ext), since ci,0/\e}atio\slashδ ci,1. We cannot
have both b≤ci,0anda≤ci,1, by (Ext), since b δ a. Together with the symmetric
arguments, this shows that, for every i≤n, there is at most one between ci,0and
ci,1which contains one between aandb. Choose a function f:{1,...,n} → {0,1}
in such a way that, for every i≤n, neither b≤ci,f(i), nora≤ci,f(i). By (D2),
eitherb≤c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n), ora≤c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n). By the assumptions in
the previous paragraph, correspondingly, either b≤ci,f(i)ora≤ci,f(i), for some
i≤n, contradicting the choice of f.
(3)⇒(1) Suppose that S= (S,≤,0,δ) is a weak contact semilattice satisfying
(D1) and (D2). Consider the Boolean algebra B= (P(S),∪,∩,∅,S,∁) and let ϕ:
P→ P(S) be the semilattice embedding deﬁned by ϕ(a) =/\e}atio\slash↑a={x∈S|a/\e}atio\slash≤x}.
Notice that ϕ(0) =∅. LetAbe the quotient B/I, where Iis the ideal of B
generated by the set of all the elements of the form ϕ(c)∩ϕ(d), withc,d∈Sand
c/\e}atio\slashδ d. Ifπ:B→Ais the quotient homomorphism, then κ=ϕ◦πis a semilattice
homomorphism from Sto (the semilattice reduct of) A.
EndowAwith the overlap contact relation. It is enough to show that κis a
contact embedding from StoA. We ﬁrst need to check that κis injective. It is
enough to show that if κ(b)≤κ(a) inA, thenb≤ainS. Ifκ(b)≤κ(a), then
ϕ(b)⊆ϕ(a)∪i, for some i∈ I, that is,
(Eq. 2) ϕ(b)⊆ϕ(a)∪(ϕ(c1,0)∩ϕ(c1,1))∪···∪(ϕ(cn,0)∩ϕ(cn,1)),
for some n∈Nandc1,0,...,c n,1∈Ssuch that c1,0/\e}atio\slashδ c1,1, ...,cn,0/\e}atio\slashδ cn,1. By
distributivity, (Eq. 2) reads
ϕ(b)⊆/intersectiondisplay
f:{1,...,n}→{0,1}(ϕ(a)∪ϕ(c1,f(1))∪···∪ϕ(cn,f(n))),
which holds if and only if
ϕ(b)⊆ϕ(a)∪ϕ(c1,f(1))∪···∪ϕ(cn,f(n)),for allf:{1,...,n} → {0,1},
if and only if in S
b≤a+c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n),for allf:{1,...,n} → {0,1},
sinceϕis a semilattice embedding. By Lemma 2.3, Ssatisﬁes (D1+), hence b≤a.
Next, we show that κis aδ-embedding. If a,b∈Sanda/\e}atio\slashδ b, thenκ(a)κ(b) = 0,
since, by deﬁnition, ϕ(a)∩ϕ(b)∈ I. Hence κ(a)/\e}atio\slashδ κ(b), sinceδis the overlap
contact on A. For the converse, assume that a,b∈Sanda δ b, we need to showCONTACT SEMILATTICES 7
thatκ(a)δ κ(b) inA, that is, κ(a)κ(b)>0, sinceδis the overlap contact on A.
This means ϕ(a)∩ϕ(b)/∈ I. Assume to the contrary that ϕ(a)∩ϕ(b)∈ I, that is,
(Eq. 3) ϕ(a)∩ϕ(b)⊆(ϕ(c1,0)∩ϕ(c1,1))∪···∪(ϕ(cn,0)∩ϕ(cn,1)),
for some n∈Nandc1,0,...,c n,1∈Ssuch that c1,0/\e}atio\slashδ c1,1, ...,cn,0/\e}atio\slashδ cn,1. Notice
that, since a δ b, thena,b >0, by (Emp), hence ϕ(a)∩ϕ(b)/\e}atio\slash=∅, since 0 ∈
ϕ(a)∩ϕ(b). Hence n≥1 in (Eq. 3). Arguing as in the proof of injectivity of κ,
the inclusion (Eq. 3) means
ϕ(a)∩ϕ(b)⊆ϕ(c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n)),for allf:{1,...,n} → {0,1}.
Bytakingcomplements, recallingthat ϕ(a) =/\e}atio\slash↑aandsetting ↑a={x∈S|x≥a},
we obtain
↑a∪↑b⊇ ↑(c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n)),for allf:{1,...,n} → {0,1},
that is,
for every f:{1,...,n} → {0,1}, either
c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n)≥a,orc1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n)≥b.
By (D2), this implies a/\e}atio\slashδ b, contradicting a δ b.
(4)⇒(1) is trivial. As far as (1) ⇒(4) is concerned, notice that, as well-known,
every Boolean algebra can be extended to a complete atomic Boolean algebra.
Embed the algebra given by (1) into a complete atomic Boolean algebra , and give
this larger algebra, too, the overlap contact relation. Since Boolea n embeddings
preserve meets and since, with overlap contact relations, a δ bis equivalent to
ab >0 (in lattices, hence in Boolean algebras), then the embedding prese rves the
contact, too.
(4)⇒(5) Since a complete atomic Boolean algebra Bis isomorphic to a ﬁeld of
sets, say, P(X), if we give Xthe discrete topology, the overlap contact on Bis the
same as the contact induced by the topology on X.
(5)⇒(6)⇒(2′) are trivial. Indeed, in a distributive lattice with an additive
closure operation K, the associated contact relation is additive. /square
Remarks 3.3.(a) The proof of Theorem 3.2 (3) ⇒(1), as given, does not work for
bounded semilattices, i.e., semilattices with also a maximum 1, which is sup posed
to be preserved by homomorphisms. However, if Shas a maximum 1, it is enough
to consider as Bthe Boolean algebra of subsets of S\ {1}in the above proof, in
order show that Theorem 3.2 holds for bounded semilattices, as well.
(b) For bounded semilattices, the implication (2′)⇒(4) (hence the equivalence
of (1) - (2′) and (4)) in Theorem 3.2 can be obtained also as a consequence of [1 0,
Proposition 3.8 and Theorem 5.6].
Ivanova[10,Deﬁnition3.1]introduced Contact join semilattices , whicharebounded
semilattices with a binary relation satisfying (Emp), (Sym) ((C1) and (C4) in the
terminology from [10]), as well as some further conditions ( C1
m,i) and (Cn,i), which
we will not report here. Then in [10, Theorem 5.6] a representation t heorem is
proved, corresponding to clause (4) in Theorem 3.2 here. Hence, b y Remarks 2.2
and 3.3(a), we get the following corollary, which provides an alternat ive axiomati-
zation for Ivanova’s Contact join semilattices.8 PAOLO LIPPARINI
Corollary 3.4. A bounded semilattice Swith a further binary relation is a Contact
join semilattices in the sense of [10, Deﬁnition 3.1] if and only if Ssatisﬁes (D1)
and(D2).
4.Embedding contact semilattices into (nonoverlap) Boolean
algebras
Condition (D2) is not needed in order to get that a weak contact semilattice can
be embedded into a weak contact distributive lattice (possibly, with n on-overlap
weak contact relation). Recall the conventions on embeddings fro m Deﬁnition 3.1.
Theorem 4.1. IfSis a weak contact semilattice, then the following condition s are
equivalent.
(1)Scan be embedded into a weak contact Boolean algebra.
(2)Scan be embedded into a weak contact distributive lattice.
(3)Ssatisﬁes (D1).
(4)Scan be embedded into a weak contact complete atomic Boolean a lgebra.
Proof.(1)⇒(2) and (4) ⇒(1) are trivial.
The proof that Ssatisﬁes (D1) in Theorem 3.2 (2′)⇒(3) does not use addi-
tivity and does not use the assumption that δis the overlap relation, hence the
corresponding implication holds in the present case, as well. This shows (2) ⇒(3).
(3)⇒(1) Deﬁne the Boolean algebras B,Aand the homomorphisms ϕ,πand
κas in the corresponding case in the proof of Theorem 3.2. Since the p roof there
thatκis injective uses only (D1), we get that κis injective in the present case, as
well. The deﬁnition of the weak contact in Aneeds to be modiﬁed in the present
situation. For x,y∈A, letx δAyif either xy >0, or there are a,b∈Ssuch that
a δ bandκ(a)≤x,κ(b)≤y.
The properties (Sym), (Ext) and (Ref) for δAare immediate. We have already
proved that κis an embedding, hence if a/\e}atio\slash= 0, then κ(a)/\e}atio\slash= 0, thus (Emp) holds in
A, since it holds in S.
It remains to prove that κis aδ-embedding. If c δ d, thenκ(c)δAκ(d) by
the deﬁnition of δA. On the other hand, suppose c/\e}atio\slashδ dand, by contradiction,
κ(c)δAκ(d). Since c/\e}atio\slashδ d, thenκ(c)κ(d) = 0, by the deﬁnition of Iin the proof of
Theorem 3.2 (3) ⇒(1). Hence, by the deﬁnition of δA, there are a,b∈Ssuch that
a δ bandκ(a)≤κ(c),κ(b)≤κ(d). This means ϕ(a)⊆ϕ(c)∪(ϕ(c1,0)∩ϕ(c1,1))∪
··· ∪(ϕ(cn,0)∩ϕ(cn,1)), for elements c1,0,...,c n,1∈Ssuch that c1,0/\e}atio\slashδ c1,1, ...,
cn,0/\e}atio\slashδ cn,1, andϕ(b)⊆ϕ(d)∪(ϕ(d1,0)∩ϕ(d1,1))∪ ··· ∪(ϕ(di,0)∩ϕ(di,1)), for
elements d1,0,...satisfying the corresponding properties. As custom by now, we
getϕ(a)⊆ϕ(c)∪ϕ(c1,f(1))∪···∪ϕ(cn,f(n)). Since ϕis a semilattice embedding,
thena≤c+c1,f(1)+···+cn,f(n)inS, for every f:{1,...,n} → {0,1}.By (D1+),
a≤cand similarly b≤d, thusa/\e}atio\slashδ bby (Ext), a contradiction.
(1)⇒(4) Suppose that Scan be embedded in a weak contact Boolean algebra
A. Embed (the Boolean reduct of) Ainto some atomic complete Boolean algebra

Remark 4.2.The implications (1) ⇒(4) in Theorems 3.2 and 4.1 are the only parts
in the present note in which we have used a consequence of the axiom of choice,
namely, [9, Form 14 B]. This remark involves also clause (5) in Theorem 3.2.
Formally, a version of choice is used also in the proof of Corollary 3.4, b ut we
expect that a more direct and choice-free proof can be found.
5.Further remarks and some examples
LetTbe the theory of Boolean algebras with an overlap contact relation. The
representationTheorem3.2canbe used in orderto provideachara cterizationofthe
set of universal consequences of Tin the language of contact semilattices. For the
statement of the next theorem, observe that clause (D1) can be expressed as a ﬁrst-
order universal sentence and (D2) can be considered a universal theory consisting
of a countable set of sentences.
Corollary 5.1. Suppose that ϕis a universal sentence in the language of contact
semilattices. Then the following conditions are equivalen t.
(1)ϕis a logical consequence of the theory of Boolean algebras wi th an overlap
contact relation.
(2)ϕis a logical consequence of the theory of distributive latti ces with an ad-
ditive contact relation.
(3)ϕis a logical consequence of (D1)and(D2).
Moreover, the following conditions are equivalent.
(4)ϕis a logical consequence of the theory of Boolean algebras wi th a weak
contact relation.
(5)ϕis a logical consequence of the theory of distributive latti ces with a weak
contact relation.
(6)ϕis a logical consequence of (D1).
Proof.(1)⇒(3). By Remark 2.2 and Theorem 3.2 (3) ⇒(1), if some semilattice S
with a binary relation satisﬁes (D1) and (D2), then Scan be embedded into some
Boolean algebra Bwith overlap contact relation. This means that Sis isomorphic
to some substructure of a reduct of B, henceSsatisﬁes all the universal sentences
satisﬁed by this reduct of B. Thus if ϕis a universal consequence of the theory
of Boolean algebras with an overlap contact relation, then every mo del of (D1)
and (D2) satisﬁes ϕ, sinceϕis in the language of contact semilattices. Then the
completeness theorem implies that ϕis a consequence of (D1) and (D2).
(3)⇒(2) By Theorem 3.2 (2′)⇒(3), every distributive lattices with an additive
contact relation satisﬁes (D1) and (D2).
(2)⇒(1) is trivial.
The equivalences of (4) - (6) is proved in a similar way, using Theorem 4 .1./square
By Example 5.2(c) below, the set of formulas ϕfor which (1) - (3) hold in the
previous theorem is distinct from the set of formulas ϕfor which (4) - (6) hold.
Corollary 5.1 can be reformulated to deal only with the language of co ntact
semilattices. The theory of Boolean algebras can be expressed in th e language of
join semilattices, asserting the existence of meets by means of a ∀∃∀sentence, and10 PAOLO LIPPARINI
similarlyforcomplementation. Underthe aboveaxiomatization, thes et ofuniversal
consequences of the theory of Boolean algebras with an overlap (w eak contact)
relation is the set of universal consequences of (D1) and (D2) ((D1) alone).
Examples 5.2.LetM3be the 5-element modular lattice with 3 atoms a,bandc.
(a) IfM3is given the overlap contact relation, then M3is a weak not additive
contact lattice. Similarly if we set a δ b,c/\e}atio\slashδ a,c/\e}atio\slashδ band the symmetrical relations.
Indeed,c δ a+b= 1.
(b) InM3seta δ b,a δ c,b/\e}atio\slashδ cand symmetrically. Call the resulting model
Mδ
3. ThenMδ
3is an additive contact lattice. However, Mδ
3cannot be semilattice
embedded into a distributive weak contact lattice, since b/\e}atio\slashδ cimpliesbc= 0 in any
weak contact lattice and this would give a=a+bc= (a+b)(a+c) = 1. Moreover,
we have b≤a+b,b≤a+candb/\e}atio\slashδ c, but it is not the case that b≤a. This
showsthat an additive contact lattice does not necessarilysatisfy (D1) (take c0=b,
c1=c).
By[12, Theorem4(b)] Mδ
3canbesemilatticeembeddedintoaboundedcomplete
weak contact lattice Swith overlap contact relation. By the above comments, S
cannot be chosen to be a distributive lattice. On the other hand, we can take Sto
be a modular lattice: let Sbe the lattice of subgroups of the product Z4×Z4of
the cyclic group of order 4. Let ϕ(b) =Z4×{0},ϕ(c) ={0}×Z4andϕ(a) be the
subgroup of Z4×Z4consisting of those pairs with even diﬀerence.
(c) LetB8be the 8-element Boolean algebra with three atoms a,bandc, with
c/\e}atio\slashδ a,c/\e}atio\slashδ b, the symmetric relations and all the other pairs of nonzero element s
δ-related. The weak contact on B8is not additive, since c δ a+bbut neither c δ a
norc δ b. By Theorem 4.1 B8satisﬁes (D1). Thus (D1) does not imply (Add),
even in weak contact Boolean algebras. In particular, (D1) does no t imply (D2),
since in Remark 2.2 we have showed that (D2) implies (Add).
The above example shows that Theorems 3.2 and Theorem 4.1 have dis tinct
ranges of application.
(d) We now show that (Add) together with (D1) do not imply (D2).
Considerthe join semilattice Sfreelygeneratedby sixelements c,d,e,f,x,y with
the relations
(Eq. 4)x≤c+e, x≤d+f, x≤c+d, x≤e+f,
y≤c+f, y≤d+e, y≤c+d, y≤e+f.
The ﬁrst relation is intended to mean x+c+e=c+e, and similarly for the other
relations. Elements of Sare formal sums of subsets of {c,d,e,f,x,y }, including the
empty sum 0, with the reducing rules x+c+e=c+eetc., modulo associativity,
commutativity and idempotence. Since the reducing rules do not mod ify the set
of elements from {c,d,e,f}appearing in the expressions, and since the rules only
eliminate either xory, then the ﬁnal result of a sequence of reductions is uniquely
determined (in formal terminology, we have a unique normal form). The same
argument shows that Sis actually a join semilattice, and that if Fis the free join
semilattice on {c,d,e,f}, then no pair of elements from Fare identiﬁed by any
chain of reductions. In other words, Sa semilattice extending F.
More explicitly, Sis the union of the free join semilattice on {c,d,e,f}, plus the
elements x,x+c,x+d,x+e,x+f,x+d+e,x+c+f, plusyand the symmetrical
sums, plus x+y+c,x+y+d,x+y+e,x+y+f.CONTACT SEMILATTICES 11
Deﬁne an additive contact relation on Sby setting c/\e}atio\slashδ d,e/\e}atio\slashδ f, the symmetrical
relations, and letting all the other pairs of nonzero elements be δ-related. From the
fact that each element is δ-unrelated with at most one nonzero element, it follows
thatSsatisﬁes (Add). On the other hand, (D2) is not satisﬁed in S: taken= 2,
c1,0=c,c1,1=d,c2,0=e,c2,1=f, andx,yin place of aandbin (D2). The
deﬁnition of δand the ﬁrst two columns in (Eq. 4) witness that the assumptions
in (D2) are satisﬁed. However, the conclusion fails, since y δ x.
The last two columns in (Eq. 4) have been added in order to have (D1) satisﬁed.
Indeed, from x≤c+e≤c+d+eandx≤d+f≤c+d+f, we get x≤c+d,
provided (D1) is satisﬁed (take b=x,a=c+d,c0=eandc1=f).
In order to check that (D1) is actually satisﬁed in Sin all the remaining cases,
we need to perform some computations. A general element of Shas the form w+b,
wherew∈ {0,x,y,x+y}andb∈F, recalling that Fis the subsemilattice of S
generated by {c,d,e,f}. Ifw,z∈ {0,x,y,x+y}, letw\zbe the sum of those
variables which appear in the sum giving w, but not in the sum giving z. E. g.,
(x+y)\x=y; (x+y)\0 =x+y;x\y=x;x\(x+y) = 0. We now check that
ifw,z∈ {0,x,y,x+y}anda,b∈F, then
(Eq. 5) w+b≤z+aif and only if b≤aandw\z≤a.
Indeed, by convention, w+b≤z+ameans
(Eq. 6) w+b+z+a=w+z+b+a=z+a.
If (Eq. 5) holds, then necessarily b+a=a, since, ascommented above,the presence
ofxorynever deletes the presence of an element from F. Ifb+a=a, that is
b≤a, then (Eq. 6) reads w+z+a=z+a, hence all the variables in wbut not in
zshould disappear on the left-hand side, and this happens exactly wh enw\z≤a.
Conversely, if b≤a, thenb+a=a, hencez+b+a=z+aand if, furthermore,
w\z≤a, thenw+z+b+a=z+a, since all the variables in wnot inzare
absorbed by a; the remaining variables in ware already present in z, hence are
absorbed by z.
With (Eq. 5) at our disposal, we now can prove that (D1) holds in S. The only
possible choices for c0andc1in (D1) are either c0=c,c1=d, orc0=e,c1=f,
or symmetrically, since all the other nonzero pairs are δ-related. By symmetry, we
may assume that c0=candc1=d. Relabel bandafrom (D1) as w+band
z+a, wherew,z∈ {0,x,y,x+y}andb,a∈Fand suppose w+b≤z+a+cand
w+b≤z+a+d. By (Eq. 5) b≤a+candb≤a+d. Notice that Fis ordered like
a distributive lattice, since it is order-isomorphic (and join semilattice isomorphic)
to the lattice on P({c,d,e,f}) with∪and∩. Fromb≤a+candb≤a+dwe get
b≤(a+c)(a+d) =a+cd=a. Again by (Eq. 5), w\z≤a+candw\z≤a+d.
Suppose, say, w\z=x. We have x≤a+cexactly in case either a≥dora≥e.
We have x≤a+dexactly in case either a≥cora≥f. Thus if both x≤a+c
andx≤a+dhold, then either a≥c+d,a≥c+e,a≥f+dora≥f+e. In each
casea≥x, by (Eq. 4). By (Eq. 5), and since we have proved that b≤a, we get
w+b≤z+a. The case w\z=yis symmetrical. If w\z=x+y, thenx+y≤a+c
exactly in case either a≥dora≥e+f. Moreover, x+y≤a+dexactly in case
eithera≥cora≥e+f. Thus if both x+y≤a+candx+y≤a+dhold, then
eithera≥c+dora≥e+f. In both cases a≥x+y, hencew+b≤z+a, again
by (Eq. 5).12 PAOLO LIPPARINI
Problems 5.3. (a) Study posets and semilattices with a weakpre-contactrelation ,
namely,abinaryrelationsatisfyingonly(Emp), (Ext), (Ref), notn ecessarily(Sym).
See, e. g., [6] for the additive case in Boolean algebras.
The problem is also connected with the proposal from [11] brieﬂy hint ed in the
introduction. As well-known, if, among subsets of a topological spa ce, we deﬁne a
relationδbyx δ yifx∩Ky/\e}atio\slash=∅, thenδis a weak pre-contact, which is preserved
under images of continuous functions.
(b) Is the class of weak contact semilattices described by Theorem 3.2 ﬁnitely
axiomatizable? This is a problem asked in [10, Section 8]. We expect that the an-
swer is negative, but we have not worked out counterexamples. Po ssibly, variations
on Example 5.2(d) might work. On the other hand, the class from The orem 4.1 is
indeed ﬁnitely axiomatizable, as shown by clause (3).
(c) Characterizethe classesof weak contactsemilattices which ca n be semilattice
embedded into weak contact modular lattices (with additive contact , with overlap
contact). Compare Example 5.2 (b).
