DIFFUSION AND MORREY DRIFT
N.V. KRYLOV
Abstract. We prove the existence of weak solutions of Itˆ o’s stochas-
tic time dependent equations with irregular diﬀusion and dr ift terms of
Morrey spaces. Weak uniqueness (generally conditional) an d a conjec-
ture pertaining to strong solutions are also discussed. Our results are
new even if the drift term vanishes.
1.Introduction
This paper is a natural continuation of the second part of [20 ], where the
weak uniqueness is proved for the time homogeneous stochast ic equations
with Morrey drift. Here we do the same in the time inhomogeneo us case
and also explore some features of strong solutions.
LetRdbe ad−dimensional Euclidean space of points x= (x1,...,xd)
withd≥2. Let (Ω,F,P) be a complete probability space, carrying a d-
dimensional Wiener process wt. Fixδ∈(0,1] and denote by Sδthe set of
d×dsymmetric matrices whose eigenvalues lie in [ δ,δ−1].
Assume that on Rd+1={(t,x) :t∈R,x∈Rd}we are given Borel Rd-
valuedfunction b= (bi) andSδ-valuedσ= (σij). We aregoingtoinvestigate
the equation
xs=x+/integraldisplays
0σ(t+u,xu)dwu+/integraldisplays
0b(t+u,xu)du. (1.1)
We are interested in the so-called weak solutions, that is so lutions that
are not necessarily Fw
s-measurable, where Fw
sis the completion of σ(wu:
u≤s). We present suﬃcient conditions for the equation to have su ch
solutions on appropriate probability spaces and investiga te uniqueness of
their distributions.
After the classical work by K. Itˆ o showing that there exists a unique
(strong) solution of (1.1) if σandbare Lipschitz continuous in x(may also
depend on ωand the nondegeneracy of σis not required), much eﬀort was
applied to relax these Lipschitz conditions. The ﬁrst autho r who achieved
a considerable progress was A.V. Skorokhod [31] who proved t he solvability
assuming only the continuity of σandbinx(which may depend on tand

again without nondegeneracy). Then by using the Skorokhod m ethod and
Aleksandrov estimates the author proved in [8] and [9] the so lvability for
the case of just measurable σand bounded bunder the nondegeneracy as-
sumption. Stroock and Varanhan [28] among other things not o nly proved
the solvability for the coeﬃcients uniformly continuous in x, but also proved
the uniqueness of their distributions.
A few words about strong solutions. In case d= 1 T. Yamada and S.
Watanabe [35] relaxed the Lipschitz condition on σto the H¨ older (1 /2)-
condition (and even slightly weaker condition) and kept bLipschitz (slightly
less restrictive). Much attention was paid to equations wit h continuous co-
eﬃcients satisfying the so-called monotonicity condition s (see, for instance,
[10] and the references therein).
T. Yamada and S. Watanabe [35] also put forward a very strong t heorem,
basically, saying that pathwise uniqueness and existence o f weak solutions
imply the existence of strong solutions. After that the majo rity of papers
on the subject are using their theorem. S. Nakao ([25]) prove d the strong
solvability in time homogeneous case if d= 1 andσis bounded away from
zero and inﬁnity and is locally of bounded variation. He also assumed that
bis bounded, but from his arguments it is clear that the summab ility of|b|
suﬃces.
A. Veretennikov was the ﬁrst author who in [33] not only prove d the
existence of strong solutions in the time inhomogeneous mul tidimensional
case whenbis bounded, but also considered the case of σkin Sobolev class,
namely,σk
x∈L2d,loc. HeusedA.Zvonkin’smethod(see[39])oftransforming
the equation in such a way that the drift term disappears. In [ 34] (also see
the references there) the result of Veretennikov is extende d to the case of σ
uniformly continuous in xandσx,b∈Lp,qwith, perhaps, diﬀerent p,qfor
σxandbsatisfying
d
p+2
q<1. (1.2)
In that case much information is available, we refer the read er to [36], [37],
[34], and the references therein.
Even the case when σis constant and the process is nondegenerate at-
tracted very much attention. M. R¨ ockner and the author in [2 2] proved,
among other things, the existence of strong solutions when b∈Lp,qunder
condition (1.2). If bis bounded A. Shaposhnikov ([29], [30]) proved the so
called path-by-path uniqueness, which, basically, means t hat for almost any
trajectorywtthere is only one solution (adapted or not). This result was
already announced by A. Davie before with a very entangled pr oof which
left many doubtful.
InafundamentalworkbyL.Beck, F.Flandoli, M.Gubinelli, a ndM.Mau-
relli ([1]) the authors investigate such equations from the points of view of
Itˆ o stochastic equations, stochastic transport equation s, and stochastic con-
tinuity equations. Theirarticle contains an enormousamou nt of information
and a vast references list. In what concerns our situation th ey require ( σON WEAK AND STRONG SOLUTIONS 3
constant and the process is nondegenerate) what they call LP S-condition
(slightly imprecise): b∈Lp,q,loc,q <∞, with equality in (1.2) in place of
<, orp=dand/bardblb/bardblLp,∞to be suﬃciently small, or else that b(t,·) be con-
tinuous as an Ld(Rd)-function, and they prove strong solvability and strong
uniqueness (actually, path-by-path-uniqueness which is s tronger) only for
almost all starting points x. Concerning the strong solutions starting from
any pointxin thetime dependent case with singular band constant σprob-
ably the best results belong to R¨ ockner and Zhao [27], where , among very
many other things, they prove existence and uniqueness of st rong solutions
of equations like (1.1) with b∈Lp,qandp,q <∞, with equality in (1.2) in
place of<, or whenb(t,·) is continuous as an Ld(Rd)-function. In the recent
paper [6] the authors consider the equations with constant σand the drift
term more general than in [27] in some respects, however, not completely
covering all possible drifts in [27]. In Section 5 of the curr ent paper we
present a conjecture and its intuitive justiﬁcation concer ning the existence
of strong solutions in the case of nonconstant diﬀusion and singular drift
which is valid for the results in [27].
Coming back to weak solutions it is worth saying that restric ting the
situation to the one when σandbare independent of time allows one to
relax the above conditions signiﬁcantly further, see, for i nstance, [7] and the
references therein.
This paper is close to [5], where the drift term is more genera l in some
respects, however, not completely covering the results in [ 26] or our results
in casebM≡0, whenσis the unit matrix and the weak uniqueness is
proved among the solutions which are constructed by approxi mating the
initial coeﬃcients by smooth ones. Our uniqueness theorem a nd uniqueness
theorems in [26] are also conditional. We prove uniqueness o nly in the class
of solutions ( which is proved to be nonempty ) admitting certain estimates,
however, in Remark 4.6 we mention a suﬃcient analytic condit ion onbwhen
the unconditional weak uniqueness holds.
In Remarks 2.2 and 4.6 we compare our results with some of thos e in an
excellent paper by R¨ ockner and Zhao [26] and refer the reade r to [1], [5],
[26] for very good reviews of the recent history of the proble m.
By the way, G. Zhao ([38]) gave an example showing that, if in c ondition
(2.2) we replace ρ−1withρ−α,α>1, weak uniqueness may fail even in the
time homogeneous case and unit diﬀusion. According to [3], as suming that
b∈Lp,qwithd/p+1/q≤1 alone does not guarantee weak uniqueness even
with unit diﬀusion (the existence is known). In Example 2.1 of [14], for any
ε >0 we haveb∈Lp,qwithd/p+ 1/q≥1 +εand there are no solution
of (1.1) with unit diﬀusion and ( t,x) = 0 at all. In Example 3 of [24] it is
given an equation dxt=σ(xt)dwtind= 2 withσσ∗= (δij) such that it has
unique and strong solutions for any starting point apart fro m the origin. If
thestarting point is the origin, only weak solutions exist. All these examples4 N.V. KRYLOV
show that we are dealing with quite delicate problems, many o f which are
to date far from being settled in the most satisfactory way.
Here is an example in which we prove existence (and condition al unique-
ness) of weak solutions: σ= 2(δij) +Ix/negationslash=0ζ(x)sin(ln|ln|x|) (quite discon-
tinuous), where ζis any smooth symmetric d×d-matrix valued function
vanishing for |x|>1/2 and satisfying |ζ| ≤1, and|b|=γ/|x|withγsuﬃ-
ciently small. Another example of bis when|b|=γ(|x|+/radicalbig
|t|)−1I|x|<1,|t|<1
withγsuﬃciently small. Both examples of bare admissible in [5] and inad-
missible in [26]. In both articles σis constant. By the way, it is well known
that the equation dxt=dwt−|xt|−1b(xt)dt, whereb(x) = (d/2)x/|x|, with
initial data x0= 0 does not have solutions, so that in the above examples γ
indeed should be suﬃciently small.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we set up the pr oblem
and formulate our assumptions. In Section 3 we prove the solv ability of
(1.1) and prove Itˆ o’s formula for the solutions. This formu la is the main
tool to prove in Section 4 the weak uniqueness of our solution s and the fact
that they constitute a strong Markov process with strong Fel ler resolvent.
In Section 5 we prove a uniqueness result for strong solution s and, in case
of smoothσandb, prove a formula which allows us to state a conjecture
about the existence of strong solutions with Dσalmost in VMO and bin a
Morrey class. Proving this conjecture is our next quite chal lenging project.
We intend to use some ideas from [16] and [18]. However, as the authors of
[27] write “It may be also possible to follow the same procedu re as in [16] to
study the time-inhomogeneous case, but one encounters a lot of diﬃculties
due to the fact that there is no good PDE theory for equations w ith such
kind of ﬁrst order terms so far.” Indeed, in the past a few atte mpts of the
author to prove the conjecture failed.
We conclude the introduction by some notation. We set

(ii) The vector-valued b= (bi) admits a representation b=bM+bB

Observe that aC(t) is the average of a(t,x) over a ball of radius ρand, if
ais independent of x, the left-hand side of (2.1) is zero.
Recall that in case ais independent of t, we writea∈VMOifa#
ρ→0 as
ρ↓0. So, our ais “almost” in VMO. It is also worth mentioning that
a∈VMOif, for instance, ( ais bounded and) Da∈Ld(Rd) (see, for
instance, Theorem 10.2.5 in [13]). An example of such (unifo rmly non-
degenerate bounded highly discontinuous) a∈VMOis given by 2( δij) +
Ix/negationslash=0ζ(x)sin(ln|ln|x|), whereζis any smooth symmetric d×d-matrix valued
function vanishing for |x|>1/2 and satisfying |ζ| ≤1.

This shows that Assumption 2.1 (ii) is weaker than (2.3), whi ch is supposed
to hold as one of alternative assumptions in [26] and [1] if p>d.
In casep=∞andq= 2, Assumption 2.1 (ii) is the same as in [1], just
takebM= 0 (this case is not considered in [26], [27]), but, if p=d(and
q=∞) our condition is, basically, weaker than in [26] (this case is excluded
in [27]) and [1] since we can take bM=bI|b|≥λ, whereλis a large constant
and /integraldisplay
Rd|bM(t,x)|ddx
will be uniformly small if b(t,·) is a continuous Ld-valued function (one of
alternative conditions in [26] and [1]) or the Ld-norm ofbM(t,·) is uniformly
small as in [1]. Our condition on bis satisﬁed with pb=d, for instance, if

Ifp=dan alternative condition on bin [26] is that
λd|B∩{|b(t,·)|>λ}| (2.5)
should be suﬃciently small uniformly for all B∈B1,t, andλ >0. It
turns out that in this case Assumption 2.1 (ii) is satisﬁed (w ithbB= 0),
anypb∈(1,d), andrb= 1. This is shown in the following way, where

whereas (2.4) is a critical case. It turns out that Assumptio n 2.1 (ii) can be
satisﬁed with pb<dandbM(t,·)/ne}ationslash∈Lpb+ε,locno matter how small ε>0 is.
In this sense we are dealing with a “supercritical” case. Als o note that σis
constant in [1], [5], [26] and many other papers.

3.Existence of solutions
By classical results, ifourcoeﬃcients areregularenough ( whatis assumed
in Theorem 3.1), given a d-dimensional Wiener process wt, for any (t,x)∈
Rd+1one can uniquely solve equation (1.1) and the solutions ( t+s,xs) form
a strong Markov process. Sometimes we write xs=xs(t,x) to emphasize
thatxsis a solution of (1.1) with given ( t,x).
The following theorem shows that, to satisfy (3.1), it suﬃce s to require
θandˆbMto be small enough. However this is, so far, only for regular
coeﬃcients. We use mb=mb(d,δ)∈(0,1] that is introduced in Theorem
Theorem 3.3 of [21].
Theorem 3.1. Suppose that σandbare smooth in xand bounded in (t,x)
along with any derivative of any order with respect to x.
Then there exists ˆbM=ˆbM(d,δ,pb,ra)>0, and there exist θ=θ(d,δ,pb)>
0, andρb=ρb(rb,mb,βb(·))>0such that if Assumption 2.1 is satisﬁed with

We prove this theorem after some preparations done under its assumption
thatσandbare smooth in xand bounded in (t,x)along with any derivative
of any order with respect to x.Set
L0u(t,x) =∂tu(t,x)+(1/2)aij(t,x)Diju(t,x).
Hereis acorollary of Theorem 6.3 of [4]. For T∈(0,∞) setRd
T= (0,T)×Rd
and ﬁx some p,q∈(1,∞).
Theorem 3.2. There exists θ=θ(d,δ,p,q)>0such that if Assumption
2.1 (i) is satisﬁed with this θ, then for any f∈Lp,q(Rd
T)andλ≥0there
exists a unique u∈W1,2
p,q(Rd
T)such thatu(T,x) = 0andL0u−λu=fin

such that for λ≥λ0
/bardblλu,√
λDu,D2u/bardblLp,q(Rd
T)≤N0/bardblf/bardblLp,q(Rd
T). (3.2)
It is perhaps worth saying a few words about how this theorem i s derived
from Theorem 6.3 of [4], which in fact only contains an a prior i estimate
for solutions of L0u−λu=fin thewholeRd+1. By taking smooth fwith
compact supportin Rd
Tone solves the model equations ∂tu+∆u−λu=fby
means of a well-known explicit formula, showing that the sol ution is smooth
bounded and along with any derivative of any order in tandxdecreases
exponentially fast as |t|+|x| → ∞. Furthermore, this solution vanishes for
t≥T. By the a priori estimate in Rd+1we have (3.2) for this solution.
Then by approximation, we prove that the theorem is true for o ur model
equation and the method of continuity ﬁnishes the job.
Remark 3.3.As it is pointed out in [4], the a priori estimate we were talki ng
about above is also true if we interchange the order of integr ations with
respect to tandxin the deﬁnition of W1,2
p,q. However, going to the full
operator LfromL0in our present setting requiresW1,2
p,qandLp,qas we have
deﬁned because of (3.7) below.

Lu(t,x) =∂tu(t,x)+(1/2)aij(t,x)Diju(t,x)+bi(t,x)Diu(t,x).(3.3)
Theorem 3.4. Suppose that Assumption 2.1 (i) is satisﬁed with θfrom
Theorem 3.2. If p∈(1,pb),q∈(1,∞)and
N0N1(d,p,pb)ˆbM≤1/2, (3.4)
whereN0=N0(d,δ,p,q,r a)is taken from Theorem 3.2 and N1(d,p,pb)

Proof. In light of the method of continuity, it suﬃces to prov e (3.5) as an
a priori estimate. From (3.2) we have

This shows how to estimate the last term in (3.6) and choose ˆbMin order
to absorb the term into the left-hand side of (3.6) on the acco unt of also
choosingλlarge enough. Then the usual change of the unknown function
utoueλt(the place where the dependence on Tappears) yields (3.5). The

cesses shows that we may concentrate on m= 1. Then ﬁrst assume that
bB≡0 and observe that it suﬃces to prove (3.9) for smooth bounded fwith
compactsupportand( t,x) = 0. Byclassical resultsforsuchan fthereexists
a regular (of class W1,2

inRd
T,u(T,·) = 0. By Itˆ o’s formula (applicable to W1,2
d+1,d+1(Rd
T)-functions)
one sees that I=u(0,0) and (3.9) follows from (3.5) and embedding theo-
rems applicable in light of (3.8).
Now still for bB≡0 we have that there is a constant Nof the same type
as in the statement of the theorem such that for any m= 1,2,...we have

from Theorem 3.2. Then, as the ﬁrst restriction, require ˆbMto satisfy (3.4),

Therefore, in light of Theorem 3.1, for the corresponding Ma rkov processes

Theorem 4.2. Letp=p(d,pb),q=q(d,pb)(see(3.14)) andT∈(0,∞).
Letc(t,x)be a real-valued bounded Borel function on Rd+1. Then for any

T(a.e.).
This theorem for n= 0 andc≡0 is a particular case of Theorem 3.4.
Adding bounded lower order terms does not aﬀect much the proof there.
Remark 4.3.In Theorem 4.2 the terminal condition is zero. However, it
also holds if it is any vT∈W2
p. Indeed, for t∈[T,2T] deﬁnef(t,x) =

vT(x)(2−t/T)/parenrightbig
extendLnon [T,2T] as∂t+ ∆ and solve with
the new Lnthe equation Lnv+cIt<Tv=fon [0,2T] with zero terminal
condition. Then by uniqueness v(t,x) =vT(x)(2−t/T) on [T,2T] andv
solves the original equation on [0 ,T] with the terminal data vT.
Theorem 4.4 (Conditional weak uniqueness) .In all situations when for
p=p(d,pb),q=q(d,pb)the assertions (i) and (iii) of Theorem 3.9, with
m= 1andˆNindependent of f, or the assertions (i) and (iv) of Theorem
3.9, with the last term in (3.17)being a local martingale, hold true, the ﬁnite
dimensional distributions of all such solutions of (1.1)with ﬁxed (t,x)are
the same.
Proof. We may assume that ( t,x) = (0,0). As we have seen in the
proof of Theorem 3.9 assertion (iii) implies (iv). Therefor e we assume that
assertions (i) and (iv) hold true. Take a Borel bounded conRd+1with
compact support, take a smooth function fonRdwith compact support,
takeT,n >0, and letvnbe the solution of the equation Lnvn+cvn= 0
inRd
Twith terminal condition vn(T,·) =f. Also take γn,sfrom Lemma 4.1
and introduce

It follows that for a sequence of stopping times τm↑T(localizing the sto-
chastic integral above)
Evn(τm,xτm)eφn,τm=vn(0,0) (4.1)
Notice that vnis a bounded continuous function. Hence, by the dominated
convergence theorem and Lemma 4.1 we infer from (4.1) that
Ef(xT)eφn,T=vn(0,0).18 N.V. KRYLOV
By sending n→ ∞and using Lemma 4.1 one more time we ﬁnd that the
limit ofvn(0,0) exists and

Since the last limit is independent of what solution xswe take and we
have the arbitrariness in candf, we conclude that all restricted as in the
statement of the theorem solutions have the same ﬁnite-dime nsional distri-
butions (one can ﬁnd a detailed proof of this conclusion, for instance, in
[23]).
The theorem is proved. /square
Remark 4.5.Deriving analytical conditions on a,bguaranteeing the weak
uniqueness and allowing bto besingular is a very challenging and hard
problem. We know of only one case mentioned in the next remark when this
was achieved.
Remark 4.6.In [26] the conditional weak uniqueness is proved under con-
dition (2.3) with p,qsatisfying (2.4). It turns out that there are situations
when Assumption 2.1 (ii) is satisﬁed and there are no p,qsatisfying (2.4)
such that (2.3) holds. For instance, take b(t,x) such that |b|=cf, where
the constant c>0 andf= (|x|+/radicalbig
|t|)−1I|x|<1,|t|<1. Then forp,q∈[1,∞],
d/p+2/q= 1,p>d, and small t>0

B1/√
t1
(|x|+1)pdx (4.3)
is of order |t|(d−p)/2, whose (q/p)th power is |t|−1which is not integrable
near zero. In case p=d,q=∞the integral in (4.3) tends to inﬁnity as
t↓0, so (2.3) fails again. The same happens if p=∞.
On the other hand, since |f| ≤1/|x|, for anyp∈[1,d), if|x| ≤2ρ
–/bardblf(t,·)/bardblp
Lp(Bρ(x))≤Nρ−d/integraldisplay
B3ρ1
|y|pdy=Nρ−p, (4.4)
and if|x|>2ρ, thenf(t,·)≤ρ−1onBρ(x) and the inequality between the
extreme terms of (4.4) holds again. Hence, if cis suﬃciently small the above
bsatisﬁes Assumption2.1 (ii) and (1.1) has solutions which a re conditionally
unique, say if σis constant. Recall that our σis not necessarily constant.
Actually, the fact that it is (unconditionally) weakly uniq ue follows from
the fact, which we will prove elsewhere, saying that for weak uniqueness it
suﬃces to have some p0,q0∈[1,∞) such that p0≥q0,d/p0+1/q0= 1 and
for anyC∈Cρto have
–/bardblf/bardblLp0,q0(C)≤Nρ−1(4.5)
withNindependent of C.
That (4.5) holds for anyp0,q0describedabove is shownas follows. If |x|+/radicalbig

By the way, G. Zhao ([38]) gave an example showing that, if in c ondition
(2.2) we replace ρ−1withρ−α,α>1, the weak uniqueness may fail even in
the time homogeneous case and unit diﬀusion.
By changing the origin we can apply Theorem 3.9 to prove the so lvability
of (1.1) with any initial data ( t,x) and get solutions with the properties
as in Theorem 3.9. For such a solution denote by Pt,xthe distribution of
(ts,xs),s≥0, (ts=t+s) on the Borel σ-ﬁeldFof Ω =C([0,∞),Rd+1). For
ω= (t·,x·)∈Ω set (ts,xs)(ω) = (ts,xs). Also set Ns=σ{(tt,xt),t≤s}.
Theorem 4.7. The process

It is also, obviously, continuous with respect to T. Hence, it is a Borel

usual measure-theoretic arguments it carries over to all Bo rel bounded f. It
follows that Et,xf(xT) is a Borel function on Rd+1for anyT >0 and Borel

given as an integral with respect to tover (0,∞). Restricting these integrals
to [0,T] we obtain operators which converge to Rλstrongly in the uniform

to show that for any T∈(0,∞) and bounded continuous fonRd+1the

Here we are dealing with the equation

0b(s,xs)ds, (5.1)
wherebisasbefore, σ= (σik)isBorelwithvaluesinthesetof d×d1-matrices
(d1≥d), andwt= (w1
t,...,wd1) is a Wiener process on a probability space.
We suppose that the matrix-valued a= (aij) =σσ∗takes its values in Sδ,
that is the set of d×dsymmetric matrices with eigenvalues between δand
δ−1. Take anrσ>0.
Theorem 5.1. Suppose that Assumption 2.1 is satisﬁed with θ,ˆbMfrom
Theorem 3.1. Then there could be only one strong solution of (5.1)on
the given probability space for which the assertions (i) and (iii) (without
(iii’)), with m= 1, or (i) and (iv), with the last term in (3.17)being a
local martingale, of Theorem 3.9 hold true. More generally, i f on a given
probability space there is at least one strong solution of (5.1), for which the
assertions (i) and (iii) (without (iii’)), with m= 1, or (i) and (iv), with the
last term in (3.17)being a local martingale, of Theorem 3.9 hold true, and
if there is another solution with the same ﬁnite dimensional distributions as
the strong one, then it coincides with the strong solution.
Proof. One is tempted to refer to the result of A. Cherny [2] sa ying
that weak uniqueness and strong existence imply the uniquen ess of strong
solutions. However, in this result one needs unconditional weak uniqueness
which we do not know how to prove in the general case. Therefor e, we
proceed diﬀerently still using the idea from [2].
Deﬁneσ= (σk) = (σik)andletτ=σ∗σ. Thisis asymmetricnonnegative
deﬁnite matrix and the following is well deﬁned
Σ = lim
ε↓0τ(τ+εI)−1,
whereIis thed1×d1identity matrix. As is easy to see by usingthe diagonal
forms, Σ2= Σ, Στ=τ, and (trAB= trBA)
tr(Σσ∗−σ∗)(σΣ−σ) = tr(Σσ∗σΣ−σ∗σΣ−Σσ∗σ+σ∗σ) = tr(−Στ+τ) = 0,22 N.V. KRYLOV
so thatσΣ =σ. Next, by extending our probability space, if necessary, we
suppose that we are also given a d1-dimensional Wiener process ¯ wsindepen-

distribution of w·givenx·and the joint distribution of ( w·,x·) are unique.
The remaining part of the proof can now follow exactly as in [2 ]. The
theorem is proved. /square
Concerning the existence of strong solutions we have a conjecture be-
fore which we introduce appropriate assumptions. This conj ecture is quite
challenging even if b≡0.
Assumption 5.2. (i) Assumption 2.1 is satisﬁed with θ,ˆbMfrom Theorem
3.1,d≥3,pb∈(2,d] and (recall (3.14)) p(d,pb)≥2,p(d,pb)>d/2.

Conjecture. There exists β=β(d,d1,δ,pDσ,pb)>0such that if
/hatwidestDσM,ˆbM≤β,
then equation (5.1)has a strong solution for which assertions (iii) and (iv)
of Theorem 3.9 hold true. Thus, it is unique in the class of (weak or strong)
solutions with the same ﬁnite-dimensional distributions.
What follows below is to explain how we came to this conjectur e and a
hypothetical way to prove it. By the way, the author had a few f ailed attempts
while following that way.
As in [18] we approximate the coeﬃcients of (5.1) by smooth fu nctions
and deal with representations of the solutions of approxima ting equations.24 N.V. KRYLOV

We borrow some text from [16] with natural modiﬁcations caus ed by the
fact that there the coeﬃcients are independent of time and al so we avoid
using the somewhat mysterious function K0(x).
As we know, (1.1) has a unique solution which we denote by xs(t,x).
By substituting it into (5.10) we see that the coeﬃcients of ( 5.10) grow
linearly inηand hence (5.10) also has a unique solution which we denote by
ηs(t,x,η). By the way, observe that equation (5.10) is linear with res pect
toηt. Therefore ηs(t,x,η) is a linear function of η. For the uniformity
of notation we set xs(t,x,η) =xs(t,x). It is also well known (see, for26 N.V. KRYLOV
instance, Sections 2.7 and 2.8 of [9]) that, as functions of xand (x,η), the

Here is the “time dependent” version of Lemma 6.1 of [16] with the same
proof as there.
Lemma 5.4. Letf(x,η)be inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable and such that each of
its derivatives grows as |x|+|η| → ∞not faster than polynomially. Let
T∈R. Then for t≤T, the function u(t,x,η) :=Ef/parenleftbig

is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable in (x,η)and each of its derivatives is continuous
intand is by absolute value bounded on each ﬁnite interval in (−∞,T]by
a constant times (1 +|x|+|η|)mfor somem. Furthermore, u(t,x,η)is
Lipschitz continuous with respect to t, in(0,T)×R2d, (a.e.)∂tu(t,x,η)
exists and

whereh(η) = (1+ |η|)−2p−d−1.
We know that u(t,x,η) is a quadratic function with respect to ηand it
satisﬁes (5.12), and we are going to prove (5.16) by multiply ing (5.12) by
up−1(t,x,η)hand integrating by parts. The possibility to do so is justiﬁe d
by estimate (6.9) of [16]: for t∈[0,r] andx,η∈Rd
|u(t,x,η)|+|ux(t,x,η)|+|uη(t,x,η)|
+|uxx(t,x,η)|+|uxη(t,x,η)|+|uηη(t,x,η)| ≤Me−µ|x|(1+|η|2),
which holds for some constants M,µ>0.
Observe that, for s∈[0,r] and

It follows by Gronwall’s inequality that, to prove the theor em, it suﬃces to
prove the following.
Lemma 5.7. There exists β=β(d,d1,δ,pDσ,pb)>0such that if
/hatwidestDσM,ˆbM≤β,
then there is a constant N=N(d,d1,δ,pDσ,pb,rσ,p,rb)such that for any

Here (5.18) is proved in [19]. Estimate (5.19) is true becaus e its left-hand
side, obviously, less than N(d,q)trB, and one estimates tr Bthrough the
right-hand side of (5.19) by dividing both by tr Band assuming that the
estimate is wrong.
We also need a slight modiﬁcation of Lemma 3.5 of [18].

we get the result. The lemma is proved.
Proof of Lemma 5.7 . We, actually, follow the proof of Lemma 7.4 of
[19] up to the places where we need to treat the terms with b(andDσ)
which are now the sums of two and where partial derivatives wi th respect
toηare involved. In [19] in a more general setting to deal with pa rtial
derivatives with respect to ηan auxiliary function K0(x) was used. We
start by assuming that
/hatwidestDσM≤β,ˆbM≤β30 N.V. KRYLOV
for someβ∈(0,1], which we are going to specify in the proof.
For simplicity of notation we drop the arguments t,x,η. We also write
U∼Vif their integrals over R2dcoincide, and U≺Vif the integral of Uis
less than or equal to that of V. Below the constants called Ndepend only
ond,d1,δ,pb,p,pDσ,rσ,rb. The constants called ˆNdepend only on d,d1,δ,
pb,pDσ. Deﬁneh= (1+|η|)−2p−d−1.
Setw=up/2and note simple formulas:
up−1ux= (2/p)wwx, up−2uxiuxj= (4/p2)wxiwxj.
Then denote by ˇL1the sum of the ﬁrst-order terms in ˇLand observe that
integrating by parts shows that

(η)uηi∼ −(1/p)hηibi

Hence,
hup−1ˇL1u∼(2/p)ηkhηibiwwxk+(4/p)hbiwwxi.
Note that |η||hη| ≤N(d,p)h, so that by Lemma 5.9 (recall ˆbM≤β)

Upon choosing β≤δ/(ˆNd) we get (5.17). The lemma is proved. /square
Now we state the key result on our way of justifying the Conjec ture. One
should pay attention to what Nin (5.27) depends on.
Recall that Assumption 5.2 is supposed to be satisﬁed in whic h we, in
particular, assume that p(d,pb)≥2,p(d,pb)>d/2.32 N.V. KRYLOV
Theorem 5.10. Takeβfrom Theorem 5.6 and assume that /hatwidestDσM,ˆbM≤β.
Takef∈C∞

(5.27)
Proof. Since uin (5.15) is quadratic with respect to η, estimate (5.16)
implies that

and the latter coincides with the left-hand side of (5.27) by Lemma 5.3. The
theorem is proved. /square
The hope is that if we approximate σandbwithσmandbmfor which
(5.27) holds and call xm
tthe corresponding solution, then in some sense xm
t
will converge to x0
twhich solves the original equation and for ξm=f(xm
t)
we will have ξm−Πn
tξm→ξ0−Πn
tξ0, which will allow to prove (5.27) for
thusobtained x0
t. Since(5.27) impliesthat the Fw

converge to ξ, we would be able to conclude that x0
tis a strong solution.
Despite the fact that the author failed a few times to rigorou sly justifyON WEAK AND STRONG SOLUTIONS 33
the above program with diﬀerent approaches, there is still ho pe that it is
realistic.
Approximating σwith smooth ones presents some diﬃculties. Indeed, if
d= 1 andσ(x) = signx, then any molliﬁcation of σwill have zeros and the
correspondingdiﬀusion is degenerate. Under our “smoothnes s” assumptions
this never happens.
We need an additional restriction on /hatwidestDσM. Take nonnegative ξ∈C∞
0(R),
η∈C∞
0(Rd) with unit integrals and supports in unit balls, set ζ(t,x) =
ξ(t)∗η(x),ζn(t,x) =nd+1ζ(nt,nx),ηn(x) =ndη(nx) and deﬁne
σ(n)=σ∗ηn, Dσ(n)
M= (DσM)∗ηn, Dσ(n)
B= (DσB)∗ηn,
where the convolution is performed with respect to x, and
b(n)=b∗ζn, b(n)
M=bM∗ζn, b(n)
B=bB∗ζn,
where the convolution is performed with respect to ( t,x). As is easy to see,
for eachn,σ(n)is bounded along with its any derivative of any order with
respect tox,b(n)is a smooth bounded function. Furthermore, Minkowski’s
inequality easily shows that Dσ(n),b(n)(with the same pDσ,pb) satisfy
/hatwidestDσ(n)
M≤/hatwidestDσM,/tildewiderDσ(n)B≤/tildewidestDσB,
ˆb(n)
M≤ˆbM, βb(n)≤βb,/bardblb(n)
B/bardbl ≤ /bardblbB/bardbl.
Finally, introduce
Γm={t:/tildewidestDσB(t)≤m},
σ(n)
m(t,x) =σ(n)(t,x)IΓm(t)+κIΓcm(t),
whereκis any ﬁxed d×d1-matrix such that κκ∗= (δij).
Lemma 5.11. Setan
m=σ(n)
mσ(n)∗
m. Then there is a sequence m(n)→ ∞as
n→ ∞such that for suﬃciently large nthe eigenvalues of an
m(n)are between
δ/4and4/δif
N(d)/hatwidestDσM≤δ1/2/4, (5.29)
whereN(d)is speciﬁed in the proof.
Proof. Obviously, we only need to deal with t∈Γm(n). Observe that for
sucht
|σ(n)∗
mλ|=|σ(n)∗λ| ≤ηn∗|σ∗λ| ≤δ−1/2|λ|.
Therefore, we need only prove that for suﬃciently large nandt∈Γm(n)
|σ(n)∗(t,x)λ| ≥ |λ|δ1/2/2. (5.30)
For anyywe have
|σ(n)∗(t,x)λ| ≥ |σ∗(t,x−y)λ|−|(σ(n)∗(t,x)−σ∗(t,x−y))λ|

we obtain
