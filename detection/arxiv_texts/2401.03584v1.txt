ABSTRACT
Context. The highly debated e ﬀect of metallicity on the absolute magnitudes of classical C epheid variables needs to be properly
quantiﬁed for determining accurate and precise distances b ased on their Leavitt Law.
Aims. Our goal is to obtain homogeneous optical and near-infrared light curves of Milky Way Cepheid variables complementing
their already collected high-resolution spectroscopic me tallicities as part of the C-MetaLL survey. Together with Gaia parallaxes, we
investigate period-luminosity-metallicity relations fo r Cepheid variables at multiple wavelengths.
Methods. We present homogeneous multiband ( grizJHK s) time-series observations of 78 Cepheids including 49 fund amental mode
variables and 29 ﬁrst-overtone mode variables. These obser vations were collected simultaneously using the ROS2 and RE MIR instru-
ments at the Rapid Eye Mount telescope. Multiwavelength pho tometric data were used to investigate pulsation propertie s of Cepheid
variables and derive their period–luminosity (PL) and peri od–Wesenheit (PW) relations.
Results. The Cepheid sample covers a large range of distances (0 .5−19.7 kpc) with varying precision of parallaxes, and thus
astrometry-based luminosity ﬁts were used to derive PL and P W relations in optical Sloan ( griz) and near-infrared ( JHK s) ﬁlters.
These empirically calibrated relations exhibit large scat ter primarily due to larger uncertainties in parallaxes of d istant Cepheids, but
their slopes agree well with those previously determined in the literature. Using homogeneous high-resolution spectr oscopic metal-
licities of 61 Cepheids covering −1.1<[Fe/H]<0.6 dex, we quantiﬁed the metallicity dependence of PL and PW re lations which
varies between−0.30±0.11 (in Ks) and−0.55±0.12 (in z) mag/dex ingrizJHK sbands. However, the metallicity dependence in the
residuals of the PL and PW relations is predominantly seen fo r metal-poor stars ([Fe /H]<−0.3 dex), which also have larger parallax
uncertainties. The modest sample size precludes us from sep arating the contribution to the residuals due to parallax un certainties,
metallicity eﬀects, and reddening errors. While this Cepheid sample is not optimal for calibrating the Leavitt law, upcoming photo-
metric and spectroscopic datasets of the C-MetaLL survey wi ll allow the accurate derivation of PL and PW relations in the Sloan and
near-infrared bandpasses, which will be useful for the dist ance measurements in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory ’s Legacy
Survey of Space and Time and upcoming extremely large telesc opes.

1. Introduction
Classical Cepheid variables in the Milky Way (MW) pro-
vide the absolute calibration of their period–luminosity ( PL)
relation or the Leavitt law (Leavitt & Pickering 1912) based
on their individual distances derived from geometric paral -
laxes. The absolute calibration of the Leavitt law is crucia l
in order to measure extragalactic distances and determine t he
present expansion rate of the Universe through the ‘cosmic d is-
tance ladder’ (Freedman et al. 2001; Riess et al. 2022b). The
present expansion rate in the late evolutionary universe, t he lo-
cal Hubble constant, is currently in discord with its early u ni-
⋆Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowverse measurement from the Planck mission (Riess et al. 2022b;
Planck Collaboration et al. 2020). This tension between the
Hubble constant measurements from the two extreme ends of th e
Universe may hint at new or missing physics in the standard co s-
mological model (Di Valentino et al. 2021; Abdalla et al. 202 2).
The accuracy and the precision of Cepheid-based distance
measurements in the traditional cosmic distance ladder are now
only limited by the systematic uncertainties in the calibra tion
of their PL relation and its metallicity dependence (Riess e t al.
2022b; Bhardwaj et al. 2023). Before Gaia , the absolute cali-
bration of Cepheid PL relations was mostly based on a lim-
ited sample of Cepheids with Hubble Space Telescope parallaxes
(Benedict et al. 2007; Riess et al. 2014, 2018) or using dista nces

determined from independent methods, such as the Baade-
Wesselink or infrared surface brightness methods (Gieren e t al.
1998; Fouqué et al. 2007; Storm et al. 2011; Bhardwaj et al.
2016). This is now changing thanks to increasingly more accu -
rate and precise geometric parallaxes of thousands of Cephe ids
in the MW from the Gaia mission (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2016, 2023b; Ripepi et al. 2023). Several recent studies hav e
utilized unprecedentedly precise Gaia parallaxes to calibrate
PL relations at multiple wavelengths (e.g. Groenewegen 201 8;
Ripepi et al. 2021, 2023; Breuval et al. 2022; Riess et al. 202 2a;
Cruz Reyes & Anderson 2023; Narloch et al. 2023). It has been
claimed that some of these calibrations of Cepheid luminosi -
ties have reached percent-level precision at speciﬁc wavel engths
(Riess et al. 2022a; Cruz Reyes & Anderson 2023).
The increasing precision of Gaia parallaxes also enabled
some of the above-mentioned studies to investigate the meta llic-
ity dependence of Cepheid PL relations at multiple waveleng ths.
However, there is currently no consensus on the metallic-
ity dependence of Cepheid period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ)
and period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations at mult iple
wavelengths. Most of the recent empirical studies have foun d
a negative metallicity coe ﬃcient with values between −0.2
and−0.5 mag/dex (e.g. Figure 19 in Trentin et al. 2023b),
which was also conﬁrmed by models for the Wesenheit re-
lations (Anderson et al. 2016; De Somma et al. 2022). Never-
theless, these coeﬃcients are often either weakly constrained
and/or diﬀer by a factor of two among recent empirical studies
(e.g. Ripepi et al. 2021; Riess et al. 2021, 2022b; Breuval et al.
2022; Molinaro et al. 2023; Bhardwaj et al. 2023; Trentin et a l.
2023b). For example, Trentin et al. (2023b) found a metallic ity
coeﬃcient of−0.458±0.052 mag/dex in Ks-band for the MW
Cepheid PL relation, while Breuval et al. (2022) found a coe ﬃ-
cient of−0.321±0.068 mag/dex using Cepheids in the Galaxy
and the Magellanic Clouds. Recently, Bhardwaj et al. (2023) de-
termined a metallicity term of −0.43±0.18 mag/dex in Ks-band
using individual metallicities of MW Cepheids. This coe ﬃcient
is better constrained ( −0.33±0.07 mag/dex) using MW and
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids within a very nar-
row range of their mean metallicities ( ∆[Fe/H]=0.46 dex). Ho-
mogeneous high-resolution spectroscopic metallicities o f MW
Cepheids having a wide range of metallicity and multiband ph o-
tometry are needed to complement their Gaia parallaxes to bet-
ter constrain the zero-points and the metallicity coe ﬃcients of
Cepheid PLZ relations.
Most of the recent studies on the empirical calibration of
Cepheid PL or PLZ relations in BVIJHK sbands utilized het-
erogeneous optical and infrared photometry together with h o-
mogeneous Gaia data. The optical PL relations, except those in
theGaia photometric systems, primarily used one of the largest
compilations of photoelectric observations of 894 Cepheid s in
standard Johnson-Cousin-Kron ﬁlters ( UBV (RI)c, Berdnikov
2008) or the modern CCD photometry of Cepheids in BVI bands
(e.g. Berdnikov et al. 2015). Time-domain variability surv eys
such as the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE ,
Udalski et al. 2018) and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Su-
pernovae (ASAS-SN, Jayasinghe et al. 2018) have also provid ed
optical Vand/orIlight curves of thousands of Cepheids in the
MW, but lack multiwavelength coverage. Moreover, several o n-
going large-scale variability surveys are now being carrie d out in
the Sloan ( ugriz) photometric system such as the Zwicky Tran-
sient Facility (ZTF, Bellm et al. 2019, in gri), enabling the dis-
covery and identiﬁcation of hundreds of Cepheids in the MW
(Chen et al. 2020).However, the pulsation properties of Cepheid variables and
their PL relations have not yet been explored in detail in the
speciﬁc Sloan ﬁlters. Ho ﬀmann & Macri (2015) used the 8.1m
Gemini North telescope to observe Cepheids and derive their
PL relations in the griﬁlters in NGC 4258, which is one of the
anchor galaxies for the extragalactic distance scale (Ries s et al.
2022b). Kodric et al. (2018) presented PL relations for Ceph eids
in the Andromeda galaxy in Sloan-like ( gri) ﬁlters using the data
from the Panoramic Survey Telescope And Rapid Response Sys-
tem survey (Tonry et al. 2012). Recently, Adair & Lee (2023)
presented the largest sample of more than 1600 Cepheids in
M33 using photometry in the gribands. Narloch et al. (2023)
provided light curves of 96 MW Cepheids and their PL rela-
tions in the Sloan ( gri) ﬁlters. Similar calibrations of griband
PL relations for RR Lyrae, Type II Cepheids, and the anomalou s
Cepheids in the globular clusters have also been provided us ing
the ZTF data (Ngeow et al. 2022a,c,b). In view of the much an-
ticipated Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Spac e
and Time (LSST, Ivezi ´c et al. 2019), which will operate at ugrizy
wavelengths, it is crucial to provide an empirical calibrat ion of
PL relations for pulsating stars in Sloan ﬁlters.
Homogeneous near-infrared (NIR) JHK sband light curves
of MW Cepheids for the largest sample of 131 Cepheids was
provided by Monson & Pierce (2011). The empirical calibra-
tions of Cepheid PL relations in JHK sbands in the litera-
ture are either based on the above-mentioned dataset com-
bined with older photometric measurements (e.g. Welch et al .
1984; Laney & Stobie 1994; Barnes et al. 1997) or using random
phase-corrected Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) observa-
tions (Skrutskie et al. 2006). NIR photometry o ﬀers several ad-
vantages over optical bands, due to lower extinction and sma ller
temperature variations leading to less scatter in the PL rel ations
(see the review by Bhardwaj 2020). However, smaller variabi lity
amplitudes and near-sinusoidal light curves of Cepheid var iables
in the NIR bands can complicate their identiﬁcation and clas si-
ﬁcation, which is easier in the optical domain due to asymmet -
ric features and larger amplitudes (Bhardwaj et al. 2015, 20 17;
Udalski et al. 2018). Given that all upcoming large observat ional
facilities will mostly operate at infrared wavelengths, it is imper-
ative to obtain homogeneous optical and infrared photometr ic
light curves of Cepheids in the MW to fully utilize current an d
future Gaia parallaxes for calibrating the Leavitt law at multiple
wavelengths.
This paper presents simultaneous optical ( griz) and NIR
(JHK s) light curves of 78 classical Cepheids for the ﬁrst time.
The manuscript is the ﬁfth in the series of the Cepheid Metal-
licity in the Leavitt Law (C-MetaLL) survey, which aims to pr o-
vide homogeneous time-series photometry and high-resolut ion
spectroscopy of Cepheids in our Galaxy (Ripepi et al. 2021;
Trentin et al. 2023a). While previous C-MetaLL publication s ex-
plored the impact of new spectroscopic observations of Ceph eids
on their PLZ relations, this paper presents the ﬁrst results of the
ongoing photometric programme. The details regarding the p ho-
tometric observations, the data reduction and analysis, an d the
photometric calibration are presented in Section 2. Multiw ave-
length light curves of Cepheids and their PL relations are di s-
cussed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. The impact of metal lic-
ity on the Leavitt law is discussed in Section 5, and the resul ts of
this work are summarized in Section 6.

2. Data and photometry
2.1. The sample of Cepheid variables
The sample of stars was selected to obtain complementary tim e-
series data for Cepheids that have high-resolution spectro scopic
observations as part of the C-MetaLL survey (Ripepi et al.
2021). Our initial sample consists of 80 Cepheids including 49
fundamental mode (FU) and 31 ﬁrst-overtone mode (FO) stars.
The majority of our Cepheids were identiﬁed as variables in t he
Gaia data releases. However, some of our initial targets, which
were included in Ripepi et al. (2021), come from the ASAS-
SN or the OGLE survey (Udalski et al. 2018; Jayasinghe et al.
2018). The pulsation periods, epochs of maximum bright-
ness, intensity-weighted mean magnitudes in G,GBP, and GRP
bands, and Gband pulsation amplitudes for 73 Cepheids were
taken from Gaia DR3 Cepheid sample (Ripepi et al. 2023).
For remaining seven Cepheids, only photometric mean mag-
nitudes in Gaia ﬁlters were taken from the source catalogue
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2023c) since they were not includ ed
as variables in Gaia . The periods and epochs of maximum
brightness, and the V/Iband amplitudes for these stars were
taken from the OGLE (OGLE-GD-CEP-0307 /1210/1227/1286)
or ASAS-SN (J163656.55-322102.2, J184816.35 +004903.4/
V0912 Aql, J193837.90 +172322.8) catalogues (Udalski et al.
2018; Jayasinghe et al. 2018). Figure 1 displays the locatio n of
Cepheid variables used in this work.
Figure 2 displays the histogram of period distribution of
Cepheids in our sample. The FU mode Cepheids cover a period
range of 3.15 to 70.80 days while FO Cepheids have periods be-
tween 0.78 and 4.91 days. These Cepheids are bright and cover
an apparent magnitude range between G=8.89 and G=14.78
mag. The distances to our Cepheids range from 0.5 kpc to 19.7
kpc with a median distance of 3.6 kpc. High-resolution spec-
troscopic metallicities for 59 Cepheids were already obtai ned as
part of the C-MetaLL survey (Ripepi et al. 2021; Trentin et al .
2023a). Among the remaining stars, six more Cepheids have
medium-resolution spectroscopic metallicities from Gaia Radial
Velocity Spectometer (RVS, Recio-Blanco et al. 2023). How-
ever, four of these six Cepheids have poor RVS quality ﬂags
and were assigned a large uncertainty of 0.5 dex (Trentin et a l.
2023b). The middle panel of Figure 2 shows the histograms of
available metallicities for all 65 Cepheids.0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0

tal and ﬁrst-overtone mode Cepheids, respectively. Two ext reme outliers
are marked with their Gaia DR3 source ID.
To conﬁrm the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of 80
Cepheids in our sample, we derived their PW relation,
WG=1.90(GBP−GRP), in the Gaia bands (Ripepi et al.
2019). The distances to these Cepheids from Bailer-Jones et al.
(2021) were used to obtain absolute Wesenheit magnitudes.
We noticed two outlier stars (5325503574371253120 /OGLE-
GD-CEP-0307, 3318591594625903104 /OGLE-GD-CEP-1286
in the PW relation shown in the bottom panel of Figure 2.
OGLE-GD-CEP-1286 is classiﬁed as rotating variable in the
ASAS-SN survey (J061105.05 +045303.5). The parallax uncer-
tainties of these stars are less than 3% and these were not cla ssi-
ﬁed as Cepheids in the Gaia data. Therefore, we excluded these
two stars from our ﬁnal sample, which consists of 78 stars wit h
49 FU and 29 FO Cepheid variables.

2.2. Observations and data reduction
Our multiband observations of Cepheid variables were obtai ned
between February 2021 and September 2022 using the Rapid
Eye Mount (REM1) Telescope located in La Silla, Chile. REM
is a 60 cm diameter fast reacting telescope with two parallel
imaging instruments: ROS2, a visible imager with four simul ta-
neous passbands (griz), and REMIR, an infrared ( JHK s) imag-
ing camera. The pixel scale of ROS2 and REMIR is 0.58 and
1.2 arcsec/pixel, respectively, for a total ﬁeld of view of about
10×10 arcmin. The time-series observations were obtained in a
monitoring mode where each Cepheid was observed once per
night, when visible during the semester. Our observations f or
each epoch consisted of three dithered frames (exposures) i n op-
tical and a minimum of ﬁve dithered frames in NIR. The ex-
posure times in optical bands were optimized depending on th e
brightness of the sources, and range from two to 240s. The ind i-
vidual exposures were relatively short in NIR (between one a nd
ten seconds), such that the background sky variations were n eg-
ligible. For fainter targets, multiple sequences of ﬁve dit hered
exposures were taken in NIR bands. These Cepheids were ob-
served on average on 24 di ﬀerent nights with the number of ob-
servations varying between ten and 60.
The optical and NIR science images and associated calibra-
tions (bias and ﬂat frames) were downloaded from the REM
data Archive2. For optical images, the bias subtraction and ﬂat
ﬁelding were performed using monthly calibration frames. F or
NIR images, pre-processed (dark subtraction and ﬂat ﬁeldin g)
images were downloaded including the sky background and co-
added images. However, the co-added NIR images were not
used because several bright residual patterns were present which
likely resulted from over-subtraction of sky background in sev-
eral pixels. These residual variations were normalized usi ng
SExtractor (Bertin 2006) in the sky background images before
applying background subtraction. Therefore, we used indiv idual
dithered frames in both optical and NIR bands for photometri c
data reduction.
2.3. Photometry
The photometry was performed on all dithered images separat ely
in each ﬁlter using the DAOPHOT/ALLSTAR (Stetson 1987) and
ALLFRAME (Stetson 1994) routines. In a given ﬁlter, all point-
like sources were ﬁrst identiﬁed using SExtractor to deter-
mine a full width at half-maximum (FWHM). An aperture pho-
tometry was then performed using DAOPHOT with an aperture
equal to the median FWHM. Up to ten brightest, non-saturated
stars were used to construct an empirical point-spread-fun ction
(PSF) excluding sources closer to the detector edges. We se-
lected the ﬁrst-frame (images of the ﬁrst-night observatio ns) as
reference frame to create a star-list. In cases where there w ere
not enough detections ( <10) in the ﬁrst-frame, we visually se-
lected images taken on another night to create a reference st ar
list. The PSF photometry was obtained using ALLSTAR on all
images and frame-to-frame coordinate transformations bet ween
the reference image and all epoch images were derived using
DAOMATCH/DAOMASTER . This procedure required the most in-
tervention because of the lack of a su ﬃcient number of stars
in images taken in poorer weather conditions resulted in ina c-
curate transformations. Those frames were excluded for whi ch
no transformation could be obtained due to poorer statistic s or

lack of signiﬁcant overlap with the reference frame. Finall y,

tions were used as input to ALLFRAME for performing PSF ﬁt-
ting across all the frames, simultaneously. The photometry on
diﬀerent nights was internally calibrated to the reference fra me
using secondary standards that have small photometric unce r-
tainties and no epoch-to-epoch variability. These thresho lds on

photometric uncertainties and epoch-to-epoch variabilit y varied
between 0.01 and 0.1 mag depending on the number of sources
within the ﬁeld of view and their photometric precision.
The photometric calibration was performed using Gaia syn-
thetic photometry (GSP, Gaia Collaboration et al. 2023a) in
Sloan ﬁlters (griz) and 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006) catalogue
in the JHK sbands. We selected homogeneous GSP catalogue for
calibrating optical photometry because there were not enou gh
common stars for several sources in the American Associatio n
of Variable Star Observers (AA VSO) Photometric All-Sky Sur -
vey (APASS) DR10 (Henden 2019). Moreover, most of these
bright Cepheids were saturated in the Sloan Digital Sky Sur-
vey catalogue. For each Cepheid location, all sources from G SP
and 2MASS catalogues were extracted within the ﬁeld of view
of 10×10 arcmin. Our photometric catalogues in a given ﬁlter
were then cross-matched with GSP or 2MASS within an initial
tolerance of 1.0′′. The common sources were used to determine
a zero-point oﬀset to calibrate our instrumental magnitudes to
Sloan or 2MASS ﬁlters. The number of calibrating stars varie d
between ﬁve and 117 for di ﬀerent star or ﬁlter, and there were
fewer common stars in gz-bands. The lack of number of stars
covering a wide colour range precluded us from solving for a
colour-term in the calibration equation. The uncertaintie s in the
magnitude zero-point o ﬀset were propagated to the instrumental
magnitudes for each Cepheid variable.
Figure 3 shows a comparison of our calibrated mean mag-
nitudes of Cepheids (see Section 3.2) with the magnitudes fr om
APASS DR10 and 2MASS for grizand JHK sﬁlters, respec-
tively. The oﬀsets are small in ribands and increase in gzbands
and at NIR wavelengths, where magnitudes from the literatur e
are based on random-epoch observations. In the case of NIR
magnitudes, the oﬀsets increase signiﬁcantly at the bright end
(Ks<8.5 mag). We note that the stars with 4 <Ks<8.5
mag saturate in the primary 1 .3s 2MASS exposure and their NIR
magnitudes come from aperture photometry on 51ms exposure
images (Skrutskie et al. 2006). The largest o ﬀset occurs at the
brightest end in the H-band. For H<6.5 mag, the median er-
rors in the REMIR J/H/Ksmagnitudes of these Cepheids are
0.05/0.09/0.08 mag, hinting at possible non-linearity and satu-
ration at the bright end in HK s. The typical uncertainties on
2MASS magnitudes are 0.02-0.03 mag, and thus the o ﬀsets at
the bright end are still within 2 σof the combined REMIR and
2MASS uncertainties. However, we also noted increased scat -
ter in the light curves around maximum light for Cepheids wit h
Ks<5 mag. In these cases, the brightest source in the REMIR
images is typically the target Cepheid, and the PSF is genera lly
constructed from fainter stars. The aperture photometry ma y be
a better option for these brightest Cepheids, and will be exp lored
in the subsequent photometric studies of the C-MetaLL surve y.
3. Optical and near-IR light curves of Cepheid
variables
3.1. Pulsation periods and the phase-binned light curves
The photometric light curves of Cepheids in both optical ( griz)
and NIR ( JHK s) ﬁlters were utilized to determine their pulsa-
tion periods using the multiband periodogram of Saha & Vivas
(2017). This hybrid algorithm for period determination usi ng
sparsely sampled light curve data at multiple wavelengths w as
employed to search periods in the range from 0.1 to 100 days
with a stepsize of 0.001 days. An average di ﬀerence of 0.002
days with a scatter of 0.012 days was found between our pe-
riods and those adopted from the literature after excluding afew spuriously determined periods. The di ﬀerence in periods ex-
ceeded 0.1 days for 17 Cepheids, all of which either had large
phase gaps in their light curves or poor light curve quality i n at
least one ﬁlter. Since all the Cepheids in our sample are brig ht
(G<14.5 mag), we adopted literature periods primarily from
Gaia DR3 (Ripepi et al. 2023) that were based on much longer
temporal baseline than our observations.
Multiwavelength light curves were phased using the adopted
periods and the epochs of maximum brightness. Since we ob-
tained multiple dithered frames in both optical and NIR ﬁlte rs
and performed photometry on individual frames, there are of ten
several data points at a given phase albeit with larger uncer tain-
ties due to lower signal-to-noise of individual exposures. Fur-
thermore, the scatter at a given phase is larger for stars wit h a
small number of secondary standards within their imaged ﬁel d
of view since these were used to obtain frame to frame transfo r-
mations and also to calibrate the photometry. Figure 4 displ ays
example light curves of FU and FO Cepheids with all epoch ob-
servations (in grey). The scatter in the light curves is evid ent
which comes from larger errors due to low signal-to-noise of
dithered frames and uncertainties in relative zero-points of pho-
tometry from diﬀerent nights. Therefore, we decided to bin the
light curves in phase improving the accuracy and precision o f
photometric data points in a given phase bin. We computed sli d-
ing mean values with a bin width of 0 .1 in phase with 15 /10
steps for FU/FO Cepheids. While 10 phase averaged data points
were suﬃcient for sinusoidal nature of FO Cepheid light curves,
we used 15 steps for FU Cepheids to fully recover the saw-toot h
feature of their light curves. We found these choices recove red
the sharp extrema of the light curves and also yielded the lea st
amount of scatter between consecutive points. A weighted me an
of all magnitudes was obtained from dithered frames within a
given phase bin and the standard deviation of the robust mean
was propagated to the photometric uncertainties.
Figure 4 also shows the phase-binned light curves of
Cepheids overplotted on the original data points. While the vari-
ability was quite evident in the original light curves, it is more
pronounced in the phase binned light curves. The phase-binn ing
procedure was particularly useful for low-amplitude FO var i-
ables for which the larger uncertainties on photometry from in-
dividual dithered frames often dominated variability ampl itudes
in NIR bands. The light curves constructed from the phase bin -
ning procedure are used for further analysis in this work. Th ese
light curves were visually inspected to assign a quality ﬂag of
A,B, and C to the best, good, and poor light curves depending o n
the scatter and the phase coverage of the light curves. There are
52/22 stars with best and good (‘A and B’) quality ﬂags, and only
four stars have poor light curves. We note that the entire sam ple
of Cepheids was used in the subsequent analysis irrespectiv e of
their light curve quality ﬂags.
3.2. Light curve ﬁtting and mean magnitudes
The light curve templates for Cepheids are not available in o p-
tical Sloan (griz) ﬁlters, but are available in NIR bands (e.g.
Inno et al. 2015). Since our light curves are phase-binned, w e
do not expect to recover small features such as bump near the
maximum light, particularly at NIR wavelengths where light
curves are more sinusoidal. Therefore, we decided to analys e
multiband light curves with the Fourier decomposition meth od
(e.g. Bhardwaj et al. 2015, 2017) and not rely on a particular set
of templates. The phase-binned light curves were ﬁtted with a

tures. Furthermore, limiting higher order ﬁt to k=5 also avoided
possible numerical ringing in case of larger phase gaps. The
best order of ﬁt was determined using the Baart’s criteria (B aart
1982).
Figure 5 displays the Fourier-ﬁtted light curves in grizJHK s
ﬁlters for FU and FO Cepheids with varying periods. The saw-
tooth light curve shape for a short-period ( P=3.86 days) FU
Cepheid and ﬂatter maxima for Cepheids with periods close to
10 days can be noted despite the phase-binning. Most Cepheid s
with periods longer than 20 days typically have similar near -
sinusoidal light curve shapes with decreasing amplitude as a
function of period. In the case of FO Cepheids, sinusoidal
Fourier series with k=1 ﬁtted well the majority of stars at
all wavelengths. The best-ﬁtting Fourier ﬁts were used to de rive
intensity-averaged magnitude and peak-to-peak amplitude for all
Cepheids except for four stars in gband and one star in Ksband.
These Cepheids with lack of measurements in one ﬁlter did not
have enough light curve phase points for a Fourier-ﬁt or mean -
magnitude determinations. The photometric mean magnitude s of
all stars are listed in Table 1.
3.3. Period-amplitude diagrams
Figure 6 displays period-amplitude diagrams for Cepheids a t
multiple wavelengths. For reference, the Gaia G band ampli-
tudes, if available, are shown in the ﬁrst panel. The predict ed
Gband amplitudes for Cepheid models representative of MW
variables with Z=0.02,Y=0.28 are also shown for di ﬀer-
ent masses ( M=4−11M⊙). These models were computed
adopting canonical mass-luminosity relation and a ﬁxed mix ing
length parameter (α=1.5) for both FU and FO mode Cepheids
(see De Somma et al. 2022, for details). In general, there is a
good agreement between predicted and observed amplitudes f or
FU mode Cepheids with a maxima around log P∼1.3 days.
The short-period FO Cepheid models exhibit larger amplitud es
than observations (De Somma et al. 2022). We note that the
predicted amplitudes are sensitive to the adopted composit ion,mass-luminosity relations, and the convective e ﬃciency in the
pulsation models.
IngrizJHK speriod-amplitude diagrams, two low-amplitude
FU Cepheids (open stars) with log P∼1.4 days can be seen
as outliers in Figure 6. These variables were classiﬁed as FU
Cepheids in the ASAS-SN survey, but their light curves show
large scatter not typical of Cepheids. Given their small V-band
amplitudes of less than 0.3 mag, no obvious periodic variati ons
were seen in our photometry despite a good phase coverage. Th e
amplitudes of phase-binned grizJHK slight curves are smaller
than 0.1 mag, and these were not classiﬁed as variables in Gaia
as well. We keep their classiﬁcation as FU Cepheids since the ir
mean magnitudes are well determined, and are used to probe
their position on the PL relations. In NIR bands, four Cephei ds
with 1.1<log(P)<1.4 days exhibit relatively high amplitudes.
These Cepheids have good-quality light curves and their ind e-
pendent G-band amplitudes also range between 0.78 and 1.12
mag.
In general, the decrease in amplitudes from the shortest-
period to 10 days, an increase in amplitude with periods up to 20
days, and a reverse trend for the longer period Cepheids is al so
seen, which is typical for FU Cepheids (Bhardwaj et al. 2015) .
The separation of FU and FO Cepheids on the period-amplitude
plane is noted for all wavelengths, but is most distinct in Ks-
band. However, two FU Cepheids (open stars) with P<10 days
andKs-band amplitudes of less than 0.1 mag are also populat-
ing FO amplitude cluster in all other bands. These Cepheids
(5718760258978008320, 2936274153063501824) were classi -
ﬁed by Gaia as FU mode and have periods of 4.70 and 6.39 days,
andG-band amplitudes of 0.35 and 0.20 mag, respectively.
4. Absolute calibration of the Leavitt law
4.1. Gaia parallaxes
TheGaia astrometric parallaxes were obtained for all Cepheids
from Gaia Collaboration et al. (2023c) to calibrate multiba nd
PL and PW relations. A few of these Cepheids are in the
Galactic disk and anti-centre direction, and therefore the paral-
Article number, page 8 of 17Bhardwaj A. et al.: Multiband light curves of Cepheid variab les and period-luminosity-metallicity relations
laxes of these distant targets have large uncertainties. Th e me-
dian error on parallaxes is 9 .4%, but 15 Cepheids have par-
allax uncertainties of >25%. Two Cepheids in our sample
have negative parallaxes, and therefore the subsequent ana ly-
sis is carried out in the parallax space. Several studies hav e
found that the Gaia parallaxes are systematically smaller result-
ing in larger distances (Arenou et al. 2018; Groenewegen 201 8;
Riess et al. 2021; Bhardwaj et al. 2021; Molinaro et al. 2023) .
Lindegren et al. (2021) provided a parallax zero-point corr ec-
tion recipe that derives a shift for an individual star based on
its magnitude, colour, and ecliptic latitude. The parallax correc-
tion varies between −0.075 and 0.023 mas for Cepheids in our
sample. However, these parallax corrections are now known t o
over-correct parallaxes resulting in smaller distances (R iess et al.
2021; Cruz Reyes & Anderson 2023; Molinaro et al. 2023). We
adopted Gaia parallaxes after applying the suggested corrections
by Lindegren et al. (2021) and include an over-correction o ﬀset
of 0.014 mas from Riess et al. (2021). The parallax uncertainties
were increased by 10% following Riess et al. (2021) and inclu de
parallax correction uncertainty of 0.005 mas added in quadr ature
(Lindegren et al. 2021).
In addition to the uncertainties on parallaxes, we also look ed
atGaia astrometric quality ﬂags: renormalized unit weight error
(RUWE) and goodness of ﬁt (GOF). There are three stars with
RUWE>1.4 and one of these also has a GOF =13.98 exceeding
a threshold of 12.5 adopted by Riess et al. (2021). The larges t
RUWE among these three Cepheids is 1.55, and their parallax
uncertainty are<15%. Moreover, six Cepheids also fall near the
sharp inﬂation point in the Lindegren et al. (2021) formulae at G
=11 mag, and their parallax corrections may have larger uncer -
tainties. Given that our sample size is modest, we do not excl ude
these Cepheids from our analysis but treat them cautiously w hen
deriving PL relations.
4.2. Reddening and extinction corrections
Groenewegen (2018) provided reddening values for more than
450 Cepheids that were primarily taken from Fernie et al.
(1995). However, there are only two Cepheids (X Sct and
V5567 Sgr) in our sample in common with Groenewegen (2018).
Ripepi et al. (2021) derived new period-colour relations to es-
timate their intrinsic colours, and therefore reddening va lues.
We used equation (4) of Ripepi et al. (2021) to derive intrins ic
(V−I)0colour for all Cepheids. For apparent ( V−I) colours,
we ﬁrst used photometric transformations from Pancino et al .
(2022) to derive VandIband magnitudes using Gaia photo-
metric data. These photometric transformations based on ho -
mogeneous Gaia data have been used to provide accurate mag-
nitudes and colours in Johnson-Kron-Cousins photometric s ys-
tems (Trentin et al. 2023a) and were preferred over the heter o-
geneous literature compilations. The apparent VandImagni-
tudes were obtained for Cepheids which have ( BP−RP) colours
within the recommended range for photometric transformati ons
(Pancino et al. 2022). The colour-excess values in ( V−I) were
converted using E(V−I)=1.28E(B−V) (Tammann et al. 2003).
Therefore, reddening E(B−V) values were obtained for 76
Cepheids, which vary between 0.092 and 2.186 mag. The uncer-
tainty in the empirical equation used to obtain intrinsic co lours
of Cepheids were propagated to the errors in the reddening va l-
ues.
Recently, Breuval et al. (2022) used Bayestar193three-
dimensional reddening maps from Green et al. (2019), and

two sets of reddening values for 67 Cepheids suggests a media n
diﬀerence of E(B−V)G19−E(B−V)=−0.02 mag with a scatter
of 0.10 mag after excluding six stars with the largest di ﬀerences.
If we scale theBayestar19 reddening values by a scale factor
of 0.884 as recommended by Green et al. (2019), the median dif -
ference increases to −0.11 mag. Recently, Narloch et al. (2023)
found that theBayestar19 reddening maps are inadequate for
Cepheids in their sample because the reddening values resul ted
in unexpectedly large scatter in the resulting PL relations . There-
fore, we adopted the reddening values based on period-colou r
relations.
To correct the magnitudes for extinction, we adopted the
Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law assuming an RV=3.1.
The total-to-selective absorption ratios were estimated u sing
thedust_extinction4python package. The e ﬀective central
wavelength corresponding to each ﬁlter was adopted from the
Spanish Virtual Observatory ﬁlter proﬁle service5. The absorp-
tion ratios in diﬀerent ﬁlters are provided in Table 2. These ab-
sorption ratios were used together with the E(B−V) values to
apply extinction corrections to the mean-magnitudes at all wave-
lengths.
4.3. Period–luminosity relations
The parallax uncertainties for Cepheids in our sample are la rge
(>25%) for 17 stars and two stars have negative parallaxes.
Moreover, 12 Cepheids have distances larger than 10 kpc. We
did not adopt distances from Bailer-Jones et al. (2021) for w hich
priors based on a three-dimensional model of the Galaxy be-
come dominant for these distant targets. Therefore, instea d of
converting apparent magnitudes to absolute magnitudes usi ng
geometric distances, we decided to work in the parallax spac e

to derive PL relations. We derived astrometry-based lumino sity
(ABL, Feast & Catchpole 1997; Arenou & Luri 1999) deﬁned
as:
ABL=ω(mas)100.2mλ−2
= 100.2(αλ+βλ(logPi−logP0)), (1)
where mλis the extinction corrected magnitude at a given wave-
length for a Cepheid with period ( Pi). The period ( P0) at which
the zero-point is determined, is adopted at log P0=1.0 days
for FU Cepheids and log P0=0.4 days for FO Cepheids. Since
our sample size of each subtype is small, we also considered
a combined sample of Cepheids by fundamentalizing the peri-
ods of FO Cepheids using the equation: PFU=PFO/(0.716−
0.027 log PFO) from Feast & Catchpole (1997). The absolute
zero-point was also obtained at log P0=1.0 days for this com-
bined sample. While ﬁtting these relations in the form of equ a-
tion (1), we iteratively removed the single largest outlier in each
iteration until all residuals are within ±3σ, whereσrepresents
the root-mean square (rms) error. We created 104random real-
izations of ABL ﬁts to derive coe ﬃcients and their associated
uncertainties. In this procedure, we also included the para llax
zero-point oﬀset error of 6µas (Riess et al. 2021).Table 4. Period-Wesenheit relations for MW Cepheids.

Figure 7 displays the ABL of Cepheids in multiple bands and
the results of the best-ﬁtting relation in the form of equati on (1)
are listed in Table 3. A clear decrease in the scatter and PL re sid-
uals is seen moving from optical to NIR wavelengths. Among
the Cepheids that have metallicity measurements, the resid uals
are larger for metal-poor stars ([Fe /H]<−0.3 dex). This sug-
gests that the metal-poor stars have higher ABL and fainter a b-
solute magnitudes for a given period. This is consistent wit h re-
cent results of a negative metallicity coe ﬃcient of PL relations
in the literature (e.g. Breuval et al. 2022; Molinaro et al. 2 023;
Bhardwaj et al. 2023). However, the metal-poor stars, most o f
which are more distant, also have larger parallax uncertain ties.
We note that the PL relation in the gband is not shown in Fig-
ure 7, but exhibits trends similar to other optical ﬁlters. T he re-
sults given in Table 3 show that the slopes of PL relations are
steeper at NIR wavelengths than optical bands, a trend that i s
typical for both Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars (Bhardwaj 2020).
4.4. Period-Wesenheit relations
The lack of accurate and independent reddening values of
Cepheids in our sample can impact their PL relations. The
Wesenheit magnitudes, which include a colour-term, are con -
structed to be reddening independent (Madore 1982). Given
a reddening law, the coe ﬃcient of the colour-term of a two-
band Wesenheit magnitude is derived from the total-to-sele ctive
absorption parameters at those wavelengths. We adopted the
Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law and derived PW relations f or
diﬀerent combination of bandpasses as listed in Table 2. Figure 8

displays ABL for the PW relations for Cepheids in our sam-
ple. These relations are apparently tighter than the PL rela tions
suggesting that the reddening values based on period-colou r re-
lations are not very accurate. The trend of larger residuals for
metal-poor stars can also be seen in the bottom panels simila r to
PL relations. Table 4 lists the coe ﬃcients of PW relations.
We tested the PL and PW relations listed in Tables 3 and 4 for
diﬀerent samples after excluding light curves with poor qualit y
ﬂags, Cepheids with RUWE >1.4 and GOF>12.5, and apply-
ing diﬀerent outlier rejection thresholds. No statistically sign if-
icant variations are seen in the coe ﬃcients of the PL/PW rela-tions. If we restrict the sample to parallax uncertainties s maller
than 15% and/or exclude stars beyond 10 kpc, the coe ﬃcients of
PL relations vary within 1 σof their quoted uncertainties, which
increase with lower statistics. While using reddening valu es from
the maps of Green et al. (2019), the PL relations exhibit sign iﬁ-
cantly larger scatter, as noted by Narloch et al. (2023). The dom-
inant source of scatter in our PL and PW relations is due to lar ge
parallax uncertainties, which are expected to improve in th e fu-
tureGaia data releases.

4.5. Comparison with literature
Figure 9 displays a comparison of slopes of PL relations in op ti-
cal and NIR ﬁlters with previously reported values in the rec ent
literature. The typical trend of steeper slopes at NIR wavel engths
is seen. However, we did not ﬁnd a distinct linear relation be -
tween the slopes and the wavelength across all ﬁlters, as not ed
by Trentin et al. (2023b). The slopes of riband PL relations for
the combined sample of Cepheids are in excellent agreement
with the slopes of empirical PL relations for FU Cepheids de-
rived by Narloch et al. (2023). The slope of gband PL relation
in this work is steeper than that derived by Narloch et al. (20 23),
but the diﬀerence is still within 2 σof their quoted uncertainties.
Di Criscienzo et al. (2013) provided theoretical PL relatio ns in
Sloan ﬁlters based on non-linear pulsation models represen ta-
tive of Cepheids in our Galaxy. The authors found their pre-
dicted slopes to be mildly steeper than the empirical slopes of
PL relations derived using photometric transformation fro m tra-ditional Johnson-Cousins to Sloan bands. The theoretical griz
band slopes in Di Criscienzo et al. (2013) are also steeper fo r
shorter period variables (log P<1.0 days) than those for longer
period stars. The slopes of rizband PL relations in this work
are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted slop es for
the entire period range models, but are signiﬁcantly steepe r in
theg-band. The slopes of our NIR PL relations for Cepheids
are in good agreement with the results of Breuval et al. (2022 ),
Trentin et al. (2023b), and Bhardwaj et al. (2023). The slope s of
G,BPandRPband PL relations are in agreement with those
from Breuval et al. (2022). In the case of optical PW relation s,
the adopted ﬁlter combinations and /or the color-coeﬃcients are
diﬀerent in this work as compared to Narloch et al. (2023). Nev-
ertheless, the slopes of WgrPW relations are in good agreement
when we consider the combined sample of Cepheids. The slope
ofWGP-W relation is similar to the one derived by Breuval et al.
(2022), while it is consistent within 2 σfor the WJKsPW relation.

5. Metallicity dependence of the Leavitt law
The inﬂuence of metallicity on the absolute magnitudes of
Cepheid variables needs to be properly quantiﬁed because it is a
crucial parameter in improving the overall ﬁt of the cosmic d is-
tance ladder used to measure the Hubble constant (Riess et al .
2022a). Most of the recent studies have measured a negative
sign for the metallicity coe ﬃcient of PL relation (Gieren et al.
2018; Riess et al. 2021; Ripepi et al. 2021; Breuval et al. 202 2;
Bhardwaj et al. 2023). While our sample of stars with spectro -
scopic metallicities is rather small, it is based on a homoge -
neously collected high-resolution spectroscopic dataset within
the framework of the C-MetaLL survey, thus minimizing sys-
tematics in combining di ﬀerent literature [Fe/H] measurements.
The residuals of PL and PW relations in Figures 7 and 8
show a clear trend as a function of metallicity such that meta l-
poor stars exhibit larger residuals. Figure 2 displays meta llicity
distribution of 65 stars with available [Fe /H] values for our sam-
ple of Cepheids. The most metal-poor star ([Fe /H]=−1.66 dex)
in our sample comes from Gaia and has poor RVS quality ﬂags.
There are four more stars with similar quality ﬂags and an as-
signed error of 0.5 dex (Trentin et al. 2023b), which were ex-
cluded from this analysis. Therefore, our sample consists o f 61
stars including 33 FU and 28 FO Cepheids. The [Fe /H] values of
these Cepheids are between −1.11 and 0.6 dex. Given small sam-
ples of both subtypes, we only derive PLZ and PWZ relations fo r
the combined sample of Cepheid variables. A metallicity ter m is
added to equation (1) in the following form:
ABL=ω(mas)100.2mλ−2
= 100.2(αλ+βλ(logPi−logP0)+γλ[Fe/H]). (2)
In order to better constrain the metallicity coe ﬃcients, we
assume that the slope of the PL relation does not change with
metallicity. This is a basic assumption that is applied when mea-
suring extragalactic distances using Cepheid variables. H owever,
the metallicity can also a ﬀect the slope of the PL relations at dif-
ferent wavelengths (e.g. Ripepi et al. 2021; Trentin et al. 2 023b).
Given a small sample size, we assume a ﬁxed slope of PL /PW
relation from Tables 3 and 4 in equation (2) at a given wave-
length. Therefore, we only solve for the absolute zero-poin t and
the metallicity coeﬃcient as free parameters.Table 5 lists the coe ﬃcients of PLZ and PWZ relations. The
metallicity coeﬃcient varies signiﬁcantly between −0.62±0.14
mag/dex in Gband and−0.30±0.11 mag/dex in Ksband. These
metallicity coeﬃcients are systematically larger than those deter-
mined by Breuval et al. (2022) and Bhardwaj et al. (2023), but
are more in agreement with previous results from the C-MetaL L
survey (Ripepi et al. 2021; Trentin et al. 2023b). We note tha t
the metallicity range of MW Cepheid sample was rather small
in Breuval et al. (2022) and Bhardwaj et al. (2023) with a mean
value of 0.09 dex (dispersion of 0 .12 dex) and 0.04 dex (disper-
sion of 0.09 dex), respectively. In contrast, the mean metallic-
ity of the sample used in this work is −0.18 dex (median value
of−0.11 dex) and a three times larger dispersion of 0 .37 dex
than Breuval et al. (2022) sample. If we restrict the sample t o
38 stars with [Fe/H] values larger than −0.3 dex, the metallicity
coeﬃcients decrease (in absolute sense) considerably but exhib it
larger uncertainties. For example, the metallicity coe ﬃcient in r-
band becomes−0.20±0.24 mag/dex from a value of −0.46±0.14
mag/dex quoted in Table 5. These coe ﬃcients are almost zero in
the PLZ/PWZ relations involving the Ksband when most metal-
poor stars ([Fe/H]<−0.3 dex) are excluded. While the metallic-
ity coeﬃcients listed in Table 5 are weakly constrained due to
lower statistics, it is important to probe this dependence m ore in
detail. These large metallicity coe ﬃcients of the order of −0.5
mag/dex can lead to signiﬁcant biases of 0 .05 mag in distance
modulus determinations if the mean metallicities of the cal ibra-
tor and target Cepheid PL relations di ﬀer by even∆[Fe/H]=0.1
dex.
5.1. Comparison of residuals of PL and PLZ relations
Figure 10 displays the residuals of PL /PW and PLZ/PWZ rela-
tions as a function of metallicity. It is clearly evident tha t the
dominant contribution to the metallicity term comes from th e

allax uncertainties. The median parallax uncertainties fo r stars
with [Fe/H]>−0.3 dex is 6.4% while it increases to 16 .7%
for Cepheids with [Fe /H]<−0.3 dex. For example, the me-
dian residuals of rband PL relation are ∆(ABL)=0.004 and
∆(ABL)=0.048 for metallicities higher (metal-rich) and lower
(metal-poor) than−0.3 dex, respectively. When the metallicity
term is included, the median residual of metal-poor stars de -
creases to∆(ABL)=0.014, while it remains the same for metal-

rich stars. Similarly, the median residuals of the ABL ﬁts fo r
WJKsWesenheit relations decrease from ∆(ABL)=0.021 to
∆(ABL)=0.012 for metal-poor stars. However, this is also ex-
pected since the median metallicities for metal-rich and me tal-
poor stars are 0.10 and−0.51 dex, respectively. Therefore, the
contribution to average residuals due to metallicity coe ﬃcientsis smaller for metal-rich stars than for metal-poor stars. N ever-
theless, it is diﬃcult to separate the contribution of metallicity ef-
fects and parallax uncertainties to the scatter in the resid uals seen
for metal-poor stars in Figure 10. If we exclude stars with la rger
parallax uncertainties, there are not enough metal-poor Ce pheids

of PL/PW relations.
5.2. Metallicity coefﬁcient as a function of wavelength
We compared the metallicity coe ﬃcients of PLZ/PWZ rela-
tions with recent determinations in the literature. Figure 11
displays metallicity coe ﬃcient as a function of wavelengths.
Breuval et al. (2022) ﬁtted a linear regression between γand 1/λ
and concluded that the metallicity e ﬀect is uniform over a wide
range of wavelength. We do not see a strong linear correlatio n
between metallicity coe ﬃcient and wavelength. The PLZ rela-
tions at longer wavelengths seem to suggest a marginally sma ller
metallicity term than at shorter wavelengths, but the uncer tain-
ties onγvalues are larger for our sample of stars. The metal-
licity coeﬃcients derived in this work are consistent with earlier
results of Ripepi et al. (2021) and Trentin et al. (2023b) wit hin
the C-MetaLL survey. We note that the approach of using indi-
vidual metallicities of MW Cepheids is the same in these stud -
ies. In contrast, the results of Gieren et al. (2018), Breuva l et al.
(2022), and Bhardwaj et al. (2023) are based on a comparison o f
intercepts of PL relations for Cepheids in the MW and the Mag-
ellanic Clouds. The average value of the metallicity coe ﬃcient
(−0.28±0.07 mag/dex) derived in these studies is systemati-
cally smaller than those listed in Table 5. In contrast, the m ean
value of the metallicity coe ﬃcient (−0.47±0.08 mag/dex) de-
rived from all the values in this work, and Ripepi et al. (2021 ),
and Trentin et al. (2023b) is signiﬁcantly larger. However, these
metallicity coeﬃcients are also based on a sample of Cepheids
covering a wide range of metallicities. Nevertheless, the m etal-
licity coeﬃcients of our PLZ/PWZ relations are in agreement
with most of these measurements given their large uncertain ties
due to a small sample of Cepheid variables.5.3. Parallax correction and the uncertainty in the zero-po int
As shown in the previous subsections, the sample presented
in this work is not optimal for the accurate and precise cali-
bration of PLZ and PWZ relations due to low statistics, large
parallax uncertainties, and the lack of accurate reddening mea-
surements. Nevertheless, we investigate the reliability o f the
large metallicity coe ﬃcients and the zero points of the cali-
brated PLZ and PWZ relations. When compared with the re-
sults of Bhardwaj et al. (2023), the zero-points of Ksband PLZ,
andWJ,Ks/WGPWZ relations are nearly ∼0.25 mag brighter
in this work. We note that both studies adopted the same par-
allax zero-point oﬀset correction of−14µas (Riess et al. 2021),
but Bhardwaj et al. (2023) sample is based on MW Cepheid stan-
dards that have accurate parallaxes, low reddening, and a li mited
metallicity range. Therefore, the readers interested in de termin-
ing Cepheid-based distances are recommended to use the cali -
brated relations provided in Bhardwaj et al. (2023) for meta llic-
ities closer to solar value, and those in Trentin et al. (2023 b) for
a wide-range of metallicities.
In the recent work within the C-MetaLL survey, Trentin et al.
(2023b) suggested that a larger parallax zero-point o ﬀset cor-
rection results in a larger distance measurement. The autho rs
found that both the slope and the intercept of PLZ /PWZ re-
lation increases by 1 −4% and the metallicity coe ﬃcient de-
creases (in absolute sense) if a larger parallax o ﬀset correction is
adopted. For the WJ,KsWesenheit, Trentin et al. (2023b, Table 3)
found the coeﬃcients of PWZ relation: α=−6.09±0.02 mag,
β=−3.29±0.03 mag/dex,γ=−0.45±0.05 mag/dex, with
no parallax zero-point o ﬀset correction. When compared with
the results in Table 5 based on a parallax zero-point o ﬀset cor-
rection of−14µas, indeed the slope and the intercept increase
and the metallicity coe ﬃcient decreases (in absolute sense), in
agreement with Trentin et al. (2023b). However, the zero-po int
is signiﬁcantly brighter by ∼0.25 mag, but this di ﬀerence be-
comes smaller when no parallax zero-point o ﬀset correction is
adopted. For this latter case, we ﬁnd the coe ﬃcients of WJ,Ks
PWZ relation:α=−6.25±0.04 mag,β=−3.42±0.07 mag/dex,
Article number, page 15 of 17A&A proofs: manuscript no. cmetalV_arXiv
γ=−0.43±0.10 mag/dex. We note the slope is ﬁxed in our
analysis, and the metallicity coe ﬃcient is now in excellent agree-
ment with Trentin et al. (2023b). However, the zero-point is still
signiﬁcantly brighter by ∼0.16 mag, due to larger parallax un-
certainties. In terms of the distance to the LMC, Trentin et a l.
(2023b, Table 3) found a value of 18 .41±0.02 mag using WJ,Ks
Wesenheit. For the LMC Cepheids, we adopt the zero-point
of 12.46±0.05 mag for WJ,KsWesenheit from Bhardwaj et al.
(2016) based on the data from Macri et al. (2015), and a mean-
metallicity of−0.41±0.02 (Romaniello et al. 2022). We ﬁnd a
LMC distance of 18 .53±0.06 mag for the no parallax zero-point
oﬀset correction. However this value of LMC distance increase s
to 18.72±0.06 mag for the calibrated PWZ relation listed in Ta-
ble 5 due to a smaller metallicity term and a brighter absolut e
zero-point. With the sample presented in this work, it is not pos-
sible to separate the contribution of parallax uncertainti es (and
parallax zero-point o ﬀset correction) and metallicity e ﬀects on
the absolute calibration of PLZ and PWZ relations.
6. Summary
We presented new homogeneously collected light curves of 78
MW Cepheid variables at optical Sloan ( griz) and NIR ( JHK s)
wavelengths. These observations were obtained simultaneo usly
using the REM telescope and present the light curves in zband
for FU Cepheids and in grizband for FO Cepheids for the ﬁrst
time. Multiband light curves of Cepheids were obtained prim ar-
ily to complement the high-resolution spectroscopic metal lici-
ties within the framework of the C-MetaLL survey (Ripepi et a l.
2021). The sample of 78 Cepheids includes 49 FU and 29 FO
mode variables. The light curves of Cepheids were ﬁtted with
Fourier sine series to determine accurate mean magnitude an d
peak-to-peak amplitudes, which were used to investigate th eir
pulsation properties. The period-amplitude diagrams were pre-
sented for the time in Sloan ﬁlters for both subtypes of Cephe ids.
The mean magnitudes were used to derive PL and PW relations
for Cepheid variables using their astrometry-based lumino sity at
multiple wavelengths.
Cepheid variables in the present study are located at a wide
range of distances between 0.5 and 19.7 kpc, and therefore th eir
Gaia parallaxes exhibit varying uncertainties with larger erro rs
for distant objects. Moreover, some of these Cepheids are lo -
cated in the Galactic disk and anti-centre direction and are sig-
niﬁcantly reddened with colour-excess values exceeding 1 m ag.
There are no reddening values available in the literature fo r most
of these Cepheids, and thus the colour-excess values were ob -
tained by determining their intrinsic colours using the emp irical
period-colour relations for Cepheid variables (Tammann et al.
2003; Ripepi et al. 2021). The larger uncertainties in paral laxes
and reddening values and a modest sample size limits the accu -
racy and precision of the PL relations for these variables. T he
reddening uncertainties can be mitigated by employing the W e-
senheit magnitudes, which results in tighter PW relations, in par-
ticular, at shorter optical wavelengths where extinction i s more
severe.
In addition to parallax uncertainties, metallicity variat ions
can also contribute to the scatter in the empirical PL and PW
relations. Homogeneous high-resolution spectroscopic me tallic-
ities for 59 of 78 Cepheids have already been collected as par t of
the C-MetaLL survey. In addition, six Cepheids have medium-
resolution spectra from Gaia -RVS (Recio-Blanco et al. 2023),
two of which have reliable quality ﬂags. We investigated the
residuals of astrometry-based luminosity with PL /PW relation
ﬁts as a function of their metallicities, if available. The r esid-uals exhibit a clear trend with metallicity such that metal- poor
stars have higher astrometry-based luminosity and fainter abso-
lute magnitudes. This trend becomes signiﬁcant for [Fe /H]<
−0.3 dex, where the parallax uncertainties are also larger. Whe n
deriving PLZ and PWZ relations, the metallicity coe ﬃcient of
these relations varies between −0.30±0.11 mag/dex in Ksband
to−0.55±0.12 mag/dex in zband. While these empirical metal-
licity coeﬃcients are weakly constrained due to the small sam-
ple size, they are systematically larger than previous dete rmi-
nations at optical and NIR ﬁlters. We compared the residuals
of PL/PW and PLZ/PWZ relations to further investigate the im-
pact of including the metallicity term, and found that the me tal-
licity contribution predominantly a ﬀects the residuals for the
most metal-poor Cepheids ([Fe /H]<−0.3 dex). The metal-
licity eﬀect becomes smaller if we exclude these metal-poor
Cepheids from the sample, but the uncertainties on the metal -
licity coeﬃcient increase due to low statistics. The small sample
size prevents us from separating the contribution to the sca tter
in the PL/PW relations due to the metallicity term and paral-
lax uncertainties. These large metallicity coe ﬃcients and bright
zero-points should be treated cautiously, and a larger samp le of
metal-poor Cepheids with more accurate parallaxes is neede d
to conﬁrm these relatively large metallicity coe ﬃcients of the
PLZ/PWZ relations.
The aim of the ongoing C-MetaLL survey is to increase the
sample of Cepheids with homogeneous photometric and spec-
troscopic data to a few hundred stars, which is ideal for the a b-
solute calibration of the Leavitt law and a proper quantiﬁca tion
of metallicity eﬀects at multiple wavelengths. In addition, the
extension of the photometric data presented in this paper wi ll
also be useful for several other scientiﬁc goals, for exampl e in-
vestigating the light curve structure of these variables at multiple
wavelengths. The simultaneous optical and NIR light curves will
be useful for a quantitative comparison with the theoretica lly
predicted light curves, thus providing strong constraints for the
input parameters to the pulsation models. Multiwavelength data
will also be used to constrain the reddening values for Cephe id
variables in a future study. Moreover, light curves in the op ti-
cal Sloan ﬁlters will serve as templates for the identiﬁcati on and
classiﬁcation of Cepheid variables in the Vera C. Rubin Obse r-
vatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time.
