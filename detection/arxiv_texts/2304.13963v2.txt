Abstract  
Visual -based defect detection is a crucial but challenging task in industrial quality control. Most mainstrea m methods rely 
on large amounts of existing  or related domain data as auxiliary information. However, in actual industrial production, 
there are often multi -batch, low -volume manufacturing scenarios with rapidly changing task demands, making it difficult 
to obtain sufficient and diverse defect data. This paper proposes a parallel solution that uses a human -machine knowledge 
hybrid augmentation method to help the model extract unknown important features. Specifically, by incorporating experts' 
knowledge of a bnormality to create data with rich features, positions, sizes, and backgrounds, we can quickly accumulate 
an amount of data from scratch and provide it to the model as prior knowledge for few -data learning. The proposed 
method was evaluated on the magneti c tile dataset and achieved F1 -scores of 60.73%, 70.82%, 77.09%, and 82.81% when 
using 2, 5, 10, and 15 training images, respectively. Compared to the traditional augmentation method's F1 -score of 
64.59%, the proposed method achieved an 18.22% increase in the best result, demonstrating its feasibility and 
effectiveness in few -data industrial defect  detection .

1. Introduction  
Quality control is a critical technology in the manufacturing process that ensures products meet required 
standards [1,2] . In recent years, deep learning techniques have made significant strides in visual quality 
inspection tasks [3,4]  due to the massive growth of manufacturing data and the powerful computing power of 
GPUs. This method possesses strong feature extraction and representation abilities for underlying data and 
complex struc tures. Additionally, its rapid adaptability to new products makes it well -suited to solving quality 
control issues for products on flexible production lines [5]. However, the data -driven method requires a 
sufficient amount of high -quality supervisory data. In actual industrial productio n scenarios, the defect rate is 
low, and abnormal data is scarce or non -existent, making data collection time -consuming and expensive  [6]. 
As a result, supervised learning models perform poorly due to the lack of data [7], and the few -data problem 
has become a bottleneck preventin g the practical implementation of defect detection in many cases.  
In this situation, the classical solution is to use data augmentation methods [8–10] to expand existing data 
through geometric deformation  such as translation, rotation, scaling, and mirroring. One or more deformations 
are applied to the data while preserving the semantic label during the transformation process [11]. However, 
this method is not designed for enhancing specific features and does not add any new practical additional 
information. The limited repetitive operations will saturate  after a certain point [12], and the model becomes 
more sensitive to the changes brought by simple transformations, even leading to overfitting.   
Fig. 1. Development schematic of industrial defect detection methods.  
In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have  utilized  learning -based methods to overcome the 
issue of inadequate training data  [13]. The most popular method involves the use of generative adversarial 
networks (GANs) for data generation . Sever al experiments have demonstrated that GANs can generate a large 
number of defect images with high fidelity and diversity  [14,15] , facilitating the effective training of deep 
defect detection networks. Consequently, numerous studies have explored the use of advanced generation 
models for data augmentation.  However, utilizi ng GANs to generate  defect samples presents several 
challenges. Existing GANs still require a substantial amount of  training data , which does not adequately 
address the problem of limited data.  Additionally, although GANs can enhance the effectiveness of existing 
data, they may generate only simpler structures and patterns  [16]. The generated defect features exhibit 
singularity in attributes such as position, direction, and shape, making them unsuitable for industrial 
environments with varying conditions. These limitations considerably constrain the performance of 
subsequent automa tic detection algorithms.  
In the literature, few -shot learning (FSL) is also a typical method for addressing the issue of insufficient 
labeled data. FSL mainly uses prior knowledge to make up for the lack of supervision information. Current 
solutions inclu de transfer [17], unsupervised learning  [18], meta -learning [19], etc. FSL meth od can generally 
be classified into three categories: enhancing training data as prior knowledge [20], improving the model to 
limit the hypothesis space more effectively [21], and improving the algorithm to find the optimal hypothesis 
in the given hypothesis space [22]. These methods have been widely used in many fields, such as ob ject 
detection [23], image segmentation [24], and image classification [25], and there have been successful 
examples in defect detection [26,27] . 
Following FSL, there have been zero -shot learning (ZSL) solutions. The basic idea of ZSL is to use some 
visible class data, supplemented with relevant information or prior knowledge as attribute labels, to identify 
unknown classes [28,29] . Current ZSL can generally be classified into two categories: embe dding -based 
methods [30,3 1] and generative model -based methods [32–34]. In defect detection cases in industrial 
scenarios, Zhang et al.  [35] proposed the Zero -DD model, which is sensitive to the differential features 
between normal images and known defect images. The extracted differential features are input into a GAN to 
discriminate against unknown defect images that fail to meet the requirements, thus achieving zero -shot 
recognition of unknown defects. So far, literature on ZSL has mainly focused on natural images, ignoring 
industrial surface defect image detection.  
 
In summary, the majority of deep learning -based defect detection methods currently demonstrate excellent 
performance under supervised learning. However, some studies have attempted to tackle the few -data 
problem, with the model's effectiveness being heavily dependent on large amou nts of data or relevant field 
data as auxiliary information, utilizing various data mining techniques for feature recognition. In actual 
industrial manufacturing processes, the incidence of product defects is low, and defect data is scarce. 
Furthermore, fl exible production lines (order -based production) often involve new products and new 
processes in small batches. Previous studies  [36] have indicated that models pre -trained on other datasets are 
unable to learn specific feature patterns in certain instances, leading to a reduction in recognition accuracy on 
other application datasets by 50%~60%. These factors pose a significant challenge for models that rely on big 
data for feature mining to satisfy the requirements of rapidly changing environments.  
In this case, domain experts have prior knowledge of feature dat a, which is an advantage that machine 
intelligence cannot match [37]. There have been many stud ies that have enhanced intelligence through 
human -machine collaboration, combining the strengths of both to form a new "1 + 1> 2" type of intelligent 
enhancement, namely, human -machine hybrid intelligence, where information from humans and machines 
interac t and promote each other, and through interaction and collaboration, the performance of artificial 
intelligence system is enhanced [38], making artificial intelligence a natural extension and expansion of 
human intelligence, more efficiently s olving complex problems [39]. Inspired by the humans -machines hybrid 
intelligence, this study attempts to involve domain experts in the iterative process of developing deep models, 
transmitting human experience information to machines, and helping machines to self -reform and iterate 
through human -machine collaboration, assisting the model in more effectivel y completing complex and 
dynamic intelligent tasks.  
Based on the analysis above, this study proposes a novel method that complements existing methods, 
which enhances model intelligence by leveraging human expertise, achieving human -machine hybrid data 
augm entation in industrial scenarios. Specifically, by intervening based on the expert understanding of 
exceptional knowledge, data with rich features , such as  positions, sizes, and backgrounds can be created, so 
human knowledge is directly transmitted to the model as prior knowledge bypass the need for big data. The 
main contributions of this study are as follows:  
 A few -data learning method has been proposed, which combines human -machine knowledge to assist in 
data augmentation. By transferring human knowledge  as prior knowledge to the model, making it 
feasible to accomplish intricate and dynamic tasks in industrial scenarios using few data.  
 The method bypasses the need for big data, incorporates domain expert knowledge to guide data creation, 
and uses style tr ansfer to generate large amounts of high -fidelity data with richness, reducing the model's 
dependence on big data.  
 Verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the method on an industrial dataset. The experimental 
results show that the method exhibits ou tstanding performance  in few -data defect detection, 
outperforming traditional and GAN -based data augmentation methods , providing a novel  research  
method and theoretical support for the existing quality control limitations of manufacturing enterprises.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related work of industrial  defect  
detection  and the mainstream method for limited data. Section 3 introduces the structure of the proposed 
method. Section 4 conducts vari ous experiments  on the magnetic  tile dataset . Section 5 shows the conclusion 
and future work   
2. Related work  
2.1. Defect detection  
Defect detection refers to the process of identifying and locating relevant defects in images, which is an 
important task in industrial manufacturing. Bef ore the advent of deep learning methods, traditional 
approaches [40–43] mainly used handcrafted feature extractors for defect recognition. Some traditional 
machine learning algorithms [44] were also commonly used. However, these methods require specialized 
domain knowledge and have limited ability to extract representative features, making them unsuitable for 
complex industrial scenarios.  
With the development of deep learning, mo re researchers have turned to us ing convolutional neural 
network models for defect detection, resulting in significant breakthroughs [45]. Various object detection 
methods [46,47]  and training strategies [48–50] have been developed. For instance, in the study [51], a cross -
scale weighted feature fusion network was proposed to identi fy and locate surface defects in hot -rolled steel, 
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 86.8%. In another study [49], a detection model for intelligent 
industrial monitoring was proposed to class ify and locate multi -scale defects on steel surfaces, achieving an 
mAP  of 80.5%.  
Deep learning models rely on large amounts of data, which is difficult to obtain in actual industrial 
production processes. The yield of defective products is low, resulting i n extremely scarce defect data, making 
the limited defect samples a bottleneck problem [15]. To address this issue, numerous studies have proposed 
various met hods to solve the few -data problem.  
2.2. Learning from few -data 
Defect detection tasks based on deep learning necessitate a considerable number of annotated training 
samples, making it imperative to obtain a high -quality detector despite limited data. To overco me the 
challenge of inadequate data, recent research has explored several approaches that can be broadly classified 
into three categories: data augmentation based  on GAN, the FSL method, and the ZSL method.  
2.2.1.  Data augmentation based on GAN  
GANs [13] are powe rful generative model s that train both a generator to generate realistic fake images and 
a discriminator to distinguish between real and fake images. It excels at generating images with diverse 
features, making it widely used in data augmentation. By lever aging  prior knowledge, GANs learn the true 
distribution of data and provide rich defect data for subsequent detection. For example, Zhang et al. [52] 
proposed an automatic defect synthesis network that generates realistic defects in various image backgrounds 
with different textures and appearances, and flexibly controls the location and category of the defects 
generated in the image backgrounds. An exc ellent Defect -GAN was trained on the CODEBRIM1 dataset and 
an additional 50,000 images. Jain et al. [53] used the generator to synthesize new surface defect images from 
random noise, which gradually improved over time to become realistic fake images for further training of the 
classification algorithm. NEU -CLS (1800 images) was used as the dataset for ver ification. Yang  et al. [54] 
proposed the Mask2Defect network, which injects prior knowledge to generate defects with a large number of 
different attribute features in a controllable way. The generated defects are used as teacher samples to fine -
tune the identification model and achieve classification and localization of defect data. The network was 
trained using a dataset that includes 1500 images. Other studies have also carried out relevant work  [55–57]. 
However, using GANs to synthesize defect samples still faces some challenges. First, existing GANs still 
require large -scale training data (at least thousands of images), which has high training costs. Datasets with  
thousands of images may even consider su pervised learning. Second, GANs tend to generate images with 
feature distributions similar to reference samples, so it is necessary to pass on anomalous data with rich 
features (such as feature patterns, directions, sizes, positions, backgrounds, etc.). Fi nally, defects generated by 
GANs have uncontrollable and limited feature diversity, which cannot fully utilize limited data to 
fundamentally improve the generalization ability of the defect detection model.  
2.2.2.  Few-shot learning method  
FSL refers to completing  object recognition tasks with a limited number of labeled samples, and its core is 
to use prior knowledge to compensate for the lack of supervision information. It can be classified into three 
categories:  
The first category involves using enhanced trainin g data as prior knowledge [20,58,59] . For instance , Tsai  
et al.  [60] proposed a two -stage CycleGAN scheme to automatically synthesize and annotate local defect 
pixels for the automatic detection of mat erial surface defects. This method eliminates the need for image 
annotation and model training and achieves the recognition of defect pixels. This method combined with 
transfer learning to achieve crack detection in a small dataset. However, t he drawback o f such methods is that 
the enhancement strategies are usually tailored for each dataset in a particular way for different applications, 
and the prior data is not easily applicable to other datasets, especially those from different fields.  
The second catego ry involves improving the model by limiting the hypothesis space [21,61,62] . For 
example, Yu et al. [63] proposed a SPNet with a matrix decomposition attention m echanism to solve the 
segmentation problem of metal surfaces. This method uses matrix decomposition to enhance the salient 
features of defects and uses a selective prototype module to extract the relationship between images. In  [64], a 
method based on graph embedding and optimal transport was proposed for detecting defects on met al surfaces. 
The GEDT module uses the correlation information between different features in the dataset to ensure the 
consistent distribution of graph embeddings, then the OPT module is used to achieve few -shot classification.  
The third category involves i mproving algorithms to find the strategy for searching the best hypothesis 
within the given hypothesis space [22,65,66] . For example, Son g et al. [67] proposed a defect recognition 
method based on dynamic weighting and joint metrics, which includes an Affine Dynamic Weighting (ADW) 
module that extracts discriminative features better by learning affine parameters. It also includes a joint metric 
method t hat combines the Kullback -Leibler (K -L) divergence covariance measurement module (KLCM) and 
cosine classifier to optimize and improve the problems of data scarcity and imbalanced defect samples.  
However, FSL typically requires a large number of samples fro m the same or related domains, and still 
requires the establishment of a large amount of universal semantic datasets, while also detailed annotation of 
abnormal sample attributes. The existing dataset bias is also one of the urgent problems to be solved at  present. 
Therefore, its performance is quite limited and still far from practical application in the industrial field.  
2.2.3.  Zero -shot learning  
ZSL is a method that utilizes known category information or sides common knowledge information as 
attribute labels to  train models [68,69] . Through sharing semantics, ZSL can achieve recognition of unknown 
categories, solve the problem  of lacking category labels, and even perform classification when the training set 
and testing set are not intersected [28,29] . ZSL can be classified into two categories: embedding -based 
methods and generative model -based methods.  
The first category is based on em bedding methods [30,31,70] . A projection function is used to map image 
features and semantic attributes to a common embedding space [71], and deep learning models are trained 
with known class information or side common knowledge information as attribute labels to achieve  
recognition of unknown classes through sharing semantics. For example, Li  et al.  [72] proposed the Class 
Knowledge Graph Construction (CKGC) method to establish relationships between basic defect classes and  
new defect classes, then used graph convolutional neural networks to learn class features, and finally inputted 
image features and class features into the classifier to predict defect class information.  
The second category is based on generative models [40 -42], aiming to generate image features for unseen 
classes using semantic attributes, usually accomplished by conditio nal generative adversarial networks 
(CGANs). Currently, this method lacks practical examples in the field of industrial defect detection, but there 
are already studies that have used this method to complete relevant applications. For example, Xian et al. [73] 
constructed a generative model using a GAN, where the discriminator is trained with the classification loss of 
class attributes, and the generator is based on the conditional GAN to generate visual featu res corresponding 
to class attributes.  
The limitation of ZSL is that the model still requires a large amount of auxiliary information for training, 
and the required auxiliary information attributes are usually defined manually, resulting in high annotatio n 
costs. In addition, there are bias and domain shift problems, and the model tends to predict seen class labels as 
output, which makes it difficult to adapt and generalize well to unseen classes outside the distribution.  
In summary, the existing methods f or addressing few -data problems all share a common characteristic, 
which is their reliance on a large amount of data or related domain data as auxiliary information, and then 
using various data mining methods to achieve defect recognition. The intelligence  of these models relies 
explicitly on model training tens of thousands of times on large datasets. However, these models are prone to 
catastrophic failures on new datasets. The challenge is to enable models to adapt to changing tasks, and our 
method is a f easible solution that starts from the data level and utilizes human intelligence to assist models to 
become more intelligent. By using a human -machine hybrid intelligent data augmentation method, we reduce 
the model's dependence on existing data, making it  possible to achieve defect detection using a few data in 
industrial scenarios.  
3. Methodology  
In this section, we introduce our proposed human -machine knowledge hybrid data augmentation method 
(Fig. 2), which integrates expert knowledge to guide the model in creating images with rich features from the 
data level, realizing anomaly detection in few -data scenarios. The method consists of four stages: image 
editing, style transfer, image filtering, and i mage classification.   
 
Fig. 2. Overall framework of the proposed method  
Step. 1 Image Editing.   
To address the challenge of extremely sparse or non -existent few -data situations in industrial defect 
detection, this study utilizes the expert's understanding of anomaly knowledge as an imaging method to create 
richness dataset from scratch. However, this method faces two challenging conditional limitations. Firstly, 
expecting experts to provide hundreds or thousands of defect features is unreasonable, so the ex pert creation 
process of anomaly samples needs to be simplified. Secondly, the images provided by the expert only contain 
sketches of the main defects in the target domain and lack realism. Therefore, synthesizing high -fidelity 
images by combining real att ribute features with the expert's sketches is essential, to create a more realistic 
industrial dataset.  
 
Fig.3 Flowchart of image editing  (Step.1).  
 
To address these issues, we propose an image editing method (Fig. 3) as follows: First, domain experts 
identify important defect features such as size, shape, rotation angle, and spatial position to create a collection 
of possible defect sketches, denoted as 𝐷. Next, we combine important features from 𝐷 and unimportant 
background features from B randomly through manual methods to create a large collection of synthetic 
sketches X with rich features, positions, sizes, and backgrounds (Fig. 4). This method n ot only incorporates 
expert knowledge guidance but also generates a large number of diverse images with different attribute 
features using a small number of synthetic sketches, which improves the recall of defect -recognition in the 
experimental results.

10: do 𝐷𝑖,𝑀𝑖 rotate with the angle of 𝜃, x direction , and y direction are scaled by coefficients  p, q 
11: fuse 𝐷𝑖 on 𝐵𝑖 with center point (𝑥𝑜,𝑦𝑜) to get 𝑋𝑖

13:      if the pixel value = 1:  
14:         the pixel value of 𝑋𝑖 = 𝐷𝑖 
15:      else:  
16:         the pixel value of 𝑋𝑖 = 𝐵𝑖 
17:   end 
18: end 
19: return  sketch image set X 
 
Step. 2 Style transfer.  
To generate realistic images from expert sketches, this study employs the domain adaptation method, with 
expert knowledge as the generated content and real images as the generation style, to construct a domain 
transfer adversarial model (Fig. 5). The model  is guided by sketches to generate high -fidelity images with 
expert knowledge. The goal of the domain transfer adversarial model is to learn the mapping function 
between two domains X and Y, where {𝑥𝑖}𝑖=1𝑁, 𝑥𝑖∈𝑋，and 𝑥~𝑃𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 (𝑥)  represents the sk etches containing 
main features, while {𝑦𝑖}𝑗=1𝑀, yj∈Y,and  y~𝑃𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 (𝑦) represents the real images containing some irrelevant 
features and the image generation style that we need. The model includes two mappings 𝐺:𝑋→𝑌 and 𝐹:𝑌→
𝑋. Mapping G ensu res the distribution matching of the original and target domains, and mapping F constrains 
the high consistency between the original and target domain data. After obtaining a well -trained model, the 
artificially created sketches set  X is input to generate the real images  𝑌′. Through this style transfer method, 
we successfully transformed expert sketches into high -fidelity images  with the style of the true images , as 
shown in Fig. 6. With more data used to train the network, more realistic image effects ca n be obtained.  
 
Fig.5 Flowchart of style transfer (Step.2)  
 
Fig.6 Example diagram of the generated image set 𝑌′, using 2, 5, 10, and 15 training images respectively.  
 
Step. 3 Image filtering.   
To ensure that the large randomly generated dataset matches the real images and does not negatively impact 
the subsequent classification model, an image screening step was introduced (Fig. 7). The image screening 
process involves visual inspection and t -SNE analysis. The visual inspection method is used to roughly filter 
out examples where the defect features do not match the actual geometry in space, and to filter out visually 
dissimilar images. For images that cannot be filtered out manually, the t -SNE method is used for screening. 
This method maps high -dimensiona l data to a low -dimensional space and represents the similarity between 
data points using t -distribution. By transforming the similarity between data points into conditional 
probability, it helps to understand the data structure while retaining the local c haracteristics of the dataset. The 
defect data of each category is visualized, and a distance threshold value  n is set between the generated image 
𝑌′ , and the real image X. Images with a threshold greater than n are filtered out to obtain the final usabl e 
dataset. The subsequent experimental results demonstrate that the model's recognition performance has indeed 
improved after the screening process.

16:       end  
17:    end  
18: return 𝑌 
Step. 4 Image classification.  
Finally, the dataset with expert knowledge is input into a defect detection model for training. For the 
selection of the classification network, we conducted experiments using VGG, ResNet, and MobileNet 
networks. The classification results among the networks showed no significant difference. However, the VGG 
network demonstrated superior classification performance for the task in this stud y. Therefore, we ultimately 
chose VGG16 as an example to showcase the results. The VGG16  consists of five convolutional layers, three 
fully connected layers, and a softmax output layer. Max -pooling is used to separate the layers, and the 
activation units o f all hidden layers use ReLU functions. We use pre -trained weights for training, and after 
obtaining a well -trained model, we test it on the same test set and make appropriate feedback adjustments 
based on the experimental results.  
4. Experimental Results and  Analysis  
This section validates the proposed method through case studies. Firstly, we introduced the dataset and 
evaluation metrics used in the study. Then, the proposed method is used to create data, followed by 
verification experiments, comparative expe riments of different methods, and multi -classification experiments. 
Finally, we discussed the experiment results and analyze the limitations of the proposed method.  
4.1. Dataset and metrics  
Experimental analysis of the proposed method was performed using the Ma gnetic Tile Dataset (MTD), 
which comprises cropped ROI images of magnetic tile surfaces. The dataset aims to detect various surface 
defects, including six categories: Blowhole, Crack, Fray, Break, Uneven (caused by the grinding process), and 
Free (non -defective) (Fig. 8). The dataset contains a total of 1344 images, with 392 defective images and 952 
non-defective images, each with a size of 300 x 300 pixels. The division of the dataset is shown in Table 1.  
The experiments were conducted using the PyTorch fr amework of Python3.7, on a server equipped with a size 
of 300 x 300 pixels. The experiments were conducted using the PyTorch framework of Python3.7, on a server 
equipped with an Intel Xeon Silver 4210R CPU and NVIDIA Geforce RTX 3090 GPU .

In the experiments, the evaluation indicators used to assess the classification performance are Accuracy, 
Recall, Precision, and F1 -score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly predicted samples, 
encompassing all categories:  𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 =(𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁)/(𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑁). Recall reflects the model's 
ability to correctly predict true defect images:  𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =𝑇𝑃/(𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁). Precision measures the proportion of 
defect predictions that are truly defects:  𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =𝑇𝑃/(𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃). F1-score is a balanced mean of Recall 
and Precision that can be used to assess the overall performance of the model:  𝐹1 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =2×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 ×
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 /(𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 +𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ). 
4.2. Experimental results  
4.2.1.  Image generation  
Due to the scarcity of  defective data and the rarity of some defects, the experiment attempted to transfer 
expert knowledge of abnormality to the model as prior knowledge. Firstly, the domain expert drew dozens of 
defect area sketches 𝐷 for five types of defects and obtained 𝐷′ after a simple expansion of 𝐷. Then, 𝐷′ was 
fused with both the defective and non -defective background. Based on expert experience, some images that 
conform to the characteristics of magnetic tiles were screened out, and the artificial sketch set X was obtained 
(Fig. 4). The specific number of images for each step is shown in Table 2.

To generate images with the style of the magnetic tile using sketch set X, a domain transformation 
adversarial model was created and trained in this section. This model guides the shape and location of defects 
in real images by sketches and generates high -fidelity images with expert knowledge. The domain -
transformed adversarial  model was trained with 2, 5, 10, and 15 images from each category, after data 
augmentation. Then, the sketch set X was fed into the well -trained domain -transformation adversarial model 
to obtain the generated image set 𝑌′. As shown in Fig. 6, the generat ed images have a high similarity with real 
 
magnetic tile images, and the defect features drawn by the expert are visible in the visualization. However, the 
detailed defect features (such as color and shape) are different from the real defects. With the add ition of 
training data, the model's performance improved, resulting in more realistic defect features with detailed edge 
features, and overall uniform images without large abnormal features due to local effects.  
Furthermore, the method of manually visualizing and setting a threshold with t-SNE  was used to filter out 
images with low similarity. In this process, a closed -loop feedback method was also employed, and based on 
the results of the testing set, negative fe edback data was repeatedly filtered to ensure that the screening could 
gradually improve the model's performance. The experimental results showed that this step did indeed 
increase the final classification accuracy. The number of images in the image genera tion and image screening 
stages can be found in Table 3 .

4.2.2.  Classificatio n 
In this section, the goal is to achieve final defect detection using the dataset obtained in the previous 
section for binary classification. The main evaluation metrics include Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 -
score . Since it is more cr itical to correctly detect defective products than qualified products in industrial 
production, the experiments' recall and precision rates are only for the defect category. A pre -trained Vgg16 is 
utilized as the classification network with the Adam optimi zer, and training epochs rang e from 50 to 200.

Fig. 9 illustrates the F1 -score of the method with an increasing number of training images. The detailed 
experimental results for each category are shown in Table 4. The experimental results indicate  that the 
proposed method can train a model with good classific ation performance even when defect data is extremely 
rare or non -existent.  With the increase of training images, the model's classification performance on defect 
images also improves. Conversely, the "fray" category exhibits the highest improvement, with t he F1 -score 
increasing to 91.69% when 15 images are used for training. This result may be due to the relatively fewer 
defect types in this category and the prior knowledge provided by experts, which can encompass most of the 
possible defect types, resultin g in a better performance on the testing set. The "break" category has relatively 
fewer improvements, with the F1 -score only reaching 80.65 % when 15 images are used. It is speculated there  
are many  types  of defects  in the "break" category, and the characteristics have significant  differences, making 
it difficult to describe the exact characteristics using 2D sketches. Therefore, it requires more labor costs for 
correction and selection than other categories. Additionally, the performance of the prop osed method varies 
across different defect categories, with different degrees of improvement observed. The performance and 
improvement degree is related to the characteristics of the defects themselves and the amount of expert 
knowledge provided. Therefore , a detailed expert knowledge intervention is required to address the specific 
defect scenarios in real -world applications and obtain better detection results. The confusion matrix of the 
experiments is shown in Fig. 10.

4.2.3.  Comparison with different methods  
To further evaluate the performance of the proposed method, this section compares the classification 
performance with other mainstream methods , inc luding  traditional augmentation methods and generative 
models . 
 
Fig. 11.  F1-score  comparison between traditional augmentation methods and our method under different types of defects  
We conducted comparative experiments by applying different methods using  2, 5, 10, and 15 images for 
each category and then feeding them into the same classification network for defect recognition. The 
experimental results are presented in Table 5. The recall and precision values reported in the results are only 
for the defect  categories, and the F1 -score  of the comparative experiments are shown in Fig.11. The results 
indicate that our proposed method improves the recognition ability of the model based on traditional 
augmentation methods, with the degree of improvement varying depending on the category. Notably, our 
method achieves higher improvement for categories with distinct defect features (e.g., crack and fray), while 
the effect is slightly worse for categories with complex and fuzzy defect features. Furthermore, we observ ed 
that traditional augmentation methods often lead to models misclassifying images as defect -free categories 
(i.e., the precision value is abnormally high), indicating poor model training. This issue is particularly 
disadvantageous in industrial scenarios  where the model must be sensitive to abnormal data. However, 
increasing the training data can alleviate this problem. In our proposed method, abnormal images with rich 
features effectively resolve this problem.

In our comparative experiments with generative models, we evaluated the performance of DCGAN  [74], 
the traditional data augmentation method, and our proposed me thod. Specifically, we focused on the "uneven" 
category and varied the number of training images (2, 5, 10, and 15) to assess the effectiveness of each 
method. We present the images synthesized by DCGAN in Fig . 12, which demonstrate that using a generative  
model  to create defect images is ineffective when facing extremely  limited data conditions. This is because 
GANs are unable to generate images with diverse features in such scenarios. Although using the entire dataset 
for training improves the richness of  the generated images, their realism is poor. In contrast, our proposed 
method generates realistic and diverse images using only a few images, making it more appropriate for 
scenarios with few data.

We then fed the enhanced data into the classification network and present the results in Table 6. The F1 
values for detection are summarized in Fig . 13, which shows that the use of GAN for data augment ation did 
not improve the detection performance of the model. The unrealistic defect images generated by GAN even 
reduced the performance of the classification model, leading to lower overall results than the traditional image 
augmentation method. Furtherm ore, models trained using GAN -based data augmentation tended to predict 
non-defective categories, further demonstrating that GAN cannot improve the classification performance of 
the model by generating samples with diverse features under few data condition s.

4.2.4.  Multi -classification experiments  
In practical production, depending on the specific quality control requirements of the product, sometimes 
classifying multiple defect types is necessary. Therefore, this section evaluates the performance of the 
proposed method on multi -classification tasks. Multi -classification tasks can be divided into two types: one is 
to treat all defect types as a unified nonconforming category for detection, and the other is to identify the type 
of each defect separately. We  conducted comparative experiments on these two multi -classification scenarios, 
using original data and traditional augmentation data as controls.  
We first conducted experiments by treating all defect types as unqualified categories. Table 7 displays the 
classification results obtained using different enhancement methods, and the recall and F1 scores are 
summarized in Fig. 14. Our proposed method achieved an F1 -score of 60.73% using only 2 training images 
per category, while the F1 -scores for the data augme ntation method and the original data were 40% and 
10.67%, respectively. These experimental results indicate that incorporating defect features as prior 
knowledge is an effective approach to improving the multi -type defect recognition model. When the number  
of images increased to 15, the F1 -score of the model reached 82.81 %, with only a minor overall improvement, 
which could be due to the limited artificially added defect features. Therefore, when the amount of data 
 
increases, the effect of this method becom es less significant. In future work, it is essential to enrich the prior 
knowledge by manually editing more diverse features to obtain a better detection model .

We proceeded to classify the six defect categories in the dataset, and the results of different methods using 
varying numbers of training images are shown in Table 8. When only two images were used for each category, 
our method achieved an F1 -score of 52.88%, which increased to 68.07% when the number of images was 
increased to 15, resulting in an imp rovement of 11.44% compared to traditional data augmentation methods 
(Fig.15). Nonetheless, the overall improvement was relatively modest compared to the defect -non-defect 
detection task, suggesting that there is still significant potential for improvement  in the multi -class defect 
classification method.

4.3. Discussion  
In this section, the experiments consist of three parts: validation of the proposed method, comparison 
experiments of different methods, and multi -class experiments. Firstly, the MTD dataset i s used to verify the 
performance of the proposed method, and classification experiments are conducted on each category using 2, 
5, 10, and 15 images respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve good 
classification perfor mance even when defect data is extremely rare or non -existent. The model's classification 
performance improves with the increase of training images, but the degree of performance improvement is 
related to the defect features and the amount of expert knowle dge provided, requiring some manual 
intervention. Among all categories, the "fray" category performs the best, achieving an F1 -score  of 53.33% 
with two training images and improving to 91.69% with 15 images.  
We conducted a series of experiments to compare the effectiveness of traditional data augmentation 
methods and generative models. The results revealed that for handling extremely scarce data, complex 
generative models were unable to generate a diverse range of defect images. Furthermore, the highly dist orted 
generated images often led to poor classification performance. Although traditional data augmentation 
methods outperformed generative models, they still had a low recall value, frequently classifying defective 
images as non -defective. This shortcomin g could hamper the model's sensitivity and generalization to 
abnormal data in industrial scenarios where new practical information is scarce. In contrast, our proposed 
method incorporates prior knowledge into the model and artificially adds various types o f defect features, 
regardless of whether they are similar to real defects. As a result, the model can identify defective images 
more accurately and achieve better performance.  
Finally, we conducted multi -class experiments and compared our method with diffe rent approaches. When 
only detecting the presence or absence of defects, our method achieved F1 scores of 60.73%, 70.82%, 77.09%, 
and 82.81% with 2, 5, 10, and 15 training images, respectively. Compared to traditional data augmentation 
methods, our method showed better performance, confirming the feasibility of using manual editing as prior 
knowledge for the model. In the six -class experiment, our method achieved an F1 score of 68.07% with 15 
training images, with a small improvement margin, which is one of  the optimization tasks for future work.  
To sum up the above experiments, the method proposed in this study  still has the following limitations: 
First, in this work, the added defect features through manual editing are limited, which results in a low 
improvement in the end, and it is difficult to meet the defect detection standards required for actual industria l 
implementation. Collecting more defect features and generating more unpredictable defect types through them 
is the optimization work we need to do in the future. Secondly, there are many manual intervention steps in 
the whole experiment process (sketch g eneration, style transfer, etc.). Therefore, simplifying the experiment 
process, reducing cumulative errors, and achieving an end -to-end detection model are issues that need to be 
 
addressed. Finally, this method is not effective in detecting multiple types  of defects at the same time, the 
model is not sensitive enough to different types of features, and the generalization is poor, so the model 
performance needs to be improved at each stage.  
5. Conclusion s and outlooks  
This study proposes a human -machine hybrid  intelligence method to address the extremely scarce data 
problem in industrial applications caused by the rapidly changing task demand (such as multi -variety and 
small -batch business models). The expert knowledge of abnormal data is directly transferred t o the model as 
prior knowledge, enabling the defect detection task to be achieved in few -data situations. The method can 
quickly accumulate data from scratch and reduce the model's dependence on big data by utilizing human -
machine collaboration to assist t he model in rapid iteration and innovation, thereby enabling more effective 
completion of complex dynamic intelligent tasks in industrial scenarios.  
The contributions of this study are as follows: first, we propose a few -data learning method that combines  
human -machine knowledge to train deep models, enabling the completion of complex dynamic tasks in 
industrial scenarios with few -data. Second, our method bypasses the need for big data and generates high -
fidelity data with rich features, such as position, size, and background, from scratch using expert knowledge 
of anomalies, reducing the model's dependence on large amounts of data. Third, our experimental results on 
industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional and GAN -based data 
augmentation methods in few -data industrial defect detection. This finding provides a new research method 
and theoretical support for overcoming quality control limitations in manufacturing enterprises.  
In future work, we plan to conduct more comp rehensive research on our proposed method. Specifically, we 
will focus on (1) optimizing the multi -category detection results to improve the model's sensitivity and 
generalization to category features, and enhance its detection performance at each stage. ( 2) Simplifying the 
experimental process by reducing the number of tedious human intervention steps, and ultimately realizing an 
end-to-end detection process. (3) Exploring methods for defect detection tasks that require no data, thus 
eliminating the model' s dependence on data and relying solely on human knowledge to accomplish 
recognition tasks in zero -data learning. These future research directions will further advance our proposed 
approach and contribute to the field of industrial defect detection.
