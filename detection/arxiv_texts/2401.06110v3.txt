Abstract
QuantumL∞algebras are higher loop generalizations of cyclic L∞algebras. Motivated by the
problem of defining morphisms between such algebras, we construct a linear category of ( −1)-
shifted symplectic vector spaces and distributional half-densities, originally proposed by ˇSevera.
Morphisms in this category can be given both by formal half-densities and Lagrangian relations;
we prove that the composition of such morphisms recovers the construction of homotopy transfer
of quantum L∞algebras. Finally, using this category, we propose a new notion of a relation
between quantum L∞algebras.

1 Introduction
A symplectic vector space ( V,ωV) is a vector space Vequipped with an antisymmetric and non-
degenerate pairing ωV. A natural notion of a morphism f: (V,ωV)→(W,ωW) between symplectic
vector spaces is a linear map f:V→Wsuch thatωV(v,v′) =ωW(f(v),f(v′)). However, this
condition immediately forces fto be injective.1Thus, the naive notion of a category of symplectic
vector spaces is rather restrictive. A common solution to this issue is to replace morphisms f:V→W
by Lagrangian subspaces of ( V,−ωV)×(W,ωW), famously advocated by Weinstein and Guillemin-
Sternberg [GS79; Wei81; Wei10; GS13]. Graphs of symplectic isomorphisms V→Wgive examples
of such Lagrangian subspaces.
We would like to consider symplectic vector spaces equipped with an additional algebraic structure,
that of a quantumL∞algebra . These are homotopy and higher loop generalizations of graded Lie
algebras equipped with a compatible degree −1 symplectic form. They first appeared in string field
theory [Zwi93], and can be succintly described using the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism [BV81; Mar01b;
Bar10; DJM15]: a quantum L∞algebra on such ( −1)-shifted symplectic vector space ( V,ω) is given
by a formal power series S∈Sym(V∗)[[ℏ]] satisfying the quantum master equation
∆eS/ℏ= 0,
where the Batalin-Vilkovisky operator ∆is defined using the degree −1 symplectic form.
To combine Lagrangian relations and quantum L∞algebras we need a further enlargement of the
(−1)-shifted symplectic category, proposed by ˇSevera [Sev04]. Morphisms from V1toV2in this quan-
tum(−1)-shifted symplectic category are “distributional” half-densities on V1×V2, with a Lagrangian
relationL⊂V1×V2seen asδ-like half-density supported on L. The Batalin-Vilkovisky Laplacian ∆
acts naturally on half-densities, and the composition, given by integration along the common factor,
is compatible with ∆. In this setting, the quantum L∞algebraScan be encoded by a ∆-closed
morphism from a point ∗toV, given by the half-density eS/ℏ√
dVon∗×V∼=V.
1Forv∈Kerf, we getωV(v,v′) =ωW(f(v),f(v′)) = 0. Requiring instead that fpreserves the inverse of the
pairings, we get that fis surjective.
2In this paper, we rigorously define a natural class of distributional half-densities on ( −1)-shifted
symplectic vector spaces, which we call generalized Lagrangians .2For two such half-densities on V1×V2
andV2×V3, we define a Batalin-Vilkovisky integration along V2, giving a partially defined composition3
on our version of the quantum ( −1)-shifted symplectic category. Our main application and the original
motivation for our work comes from composing the quantum L∞algebraeS/ℏ√
dV:∗→Vwith a
surjective Lagrangian relation L:V− → →W. As both of these distributional half-densities are ∆-closed,
their composition is ∆-closed as well, and defines a quantum L∞algebra onW, which was previously
constructed as the homotopy transfer or the effective action by many authors [Cos11; Mne08; CL10;
Bar13; BM18; DJP19].
1.1 Content of the paper
In the second section, we recall some useful facts about Lagrangian relations of ( −1)-shifted symplectic
vector spaces. The content of this section is mostly standard, with many results adapted from the
book of Guillemin and Sternberg [GS13] to the ( −1)-shifted setting. We emphasize the canonical
factorization of a Lagrangian relation into a reduction and a coreduction. Our results on composition
of these factorizations in Sections 2.4, 2.5 appear to be new.
In the third section, we introduce formal half-densities and formal Batalin-Vilkovisky fiber integrals
along surjective Lagrangian relations. The linear ( −1)-shifted symplectic category is a natural setting
for these integrals, providing an invariant way to define fiber BV integration [Sch93a; ABF10]. Finally,
we relate this version of the BV fiber integral to the homological perturbation lemma.
In the fourth section, we start by defining linear distributional half-densities, called generalized
Lagrangians , on a (−1)-shifted symplectic vector space V. Roughly, they are given by a coisotropic
subspaceC⊂Vand a formal half-density on the coisotropic reduction C/Cω. Using this generalized
notion of a Lagrangian relation, we define a version of the quantum ( −1)-shifted symplectic category
LinQSymp−1. The composition is defined using the fiber BV integral along a reduction constructed
from the coisotropic relations, and we give some examples of such compositions. We finish by inter-
preting the construction of the effective action of [DJP19] as a commutative triangle in LinQSymp−1,
and proposing a more general symmetric relation between quantum L∞algebras using factorization
from Section 2.
1.2 Related and future work
We will now explain how our work relates to quantum field theory, point to other works studying
Lagrangian and coisotropic correspondences and list some directions of research.
The category of non-linear (or smooth) Lagrangian relations has received considerable attention
both from the viewpoint of symplectic geometry and mathematical physics [Wei10; GS13; CHS21].
Coisotropic relations, which appeared naturally in the present paper when considering distributional
half-densities as in [Sev04], are less studied; see however [Wei88; HMS20]. Half-densities in the 0-
shifted symplectic setting were extensively studied by Guillemin and Sternberg4
2See also Remark 4.2, which further explains why it’s natural to see (distributional) half-densities as a generalization
of Lagrangian subspaces.
3The composition is defined if we can compute the perturbative Gaussian integral, i.e. if a relevant quadratic form
is non-degenerate.
4Let us mention a different way to add half-densities to the linear symplectic category: The enhanced symplectic
category introduced by Guillemin and Sternberg [GS13] has objects given by symplectic spaces and morphisms given
by half-densities on Lagrangian relations(L⊂V×W,ρ∈|L|1
2).
One can mimic this construction in the ( −1)-shifted symplectic case, but quantum L∞algebras do not induce any
natural half-densities on a Lagrangian subspace, and the resulting Guillemin-Sternberg category of enhanced relations
does not involve the integration theory we are looking for. We wish to describe BV fiber integration over the fiber I
of a coisotropic reduction (in the sense of Lemma 3.5). But in the enhanced symplectic category, one encounters no
natural densities on Iand composition is defined using solely the canonical isomorphisms from Lemmata 3.3, 3.4. For
these reasons, we will not use this similarly-looking construction.
31.2.1 Physics
Lagrangian subspaces and half-densities in this work have origin in the Batalin-Vilkovisky approach
to quantum field theory. The ( −1)-shifted symplectic vector space Vwe consider should be seen as
the (linear and finite-dimensional approximations of the) space of BRST fields and their antifields.
The half-densities relevant to physics are of the form eS/ℏ√
dVorFeS/ℏ√
dVfor an observable F.
A Lagrangian subspace L⊂Vcorresponds to choosing a gauge and pairing it with Fcomputes the
expectation value of F ∫︂
LFeS/ℏ√
dV=⟨F⟩∫︂
LeS/ℏ√
dV. (1)
This interpretation can be extended to the category LinQSymp−1. Its objects, (−1)-shifted sym-
plectic vector spaces, are spaces of field histories, while morphisms V→Ware “coupled” quantum
field theories on V×W. The composition in LinQSymp−1is given in terms of the BV fiber integral;
the expectation value (1) can be seen as the result of the following composition
∗ V ∗FeS/ℏ√
dV δL. (2)
It would be interesting to find examples of generalized Lagrangian relations (distributional half-
densities) from quantum field theory, for example from the AKSZ formalism [Ale+97].
This viewpoint also relates physics with homotopy algebras, see [DJP19; Jur+19; CHP24] and
references therein, and [GKW24] for a recent highlight. Let us also mention that Lagrangian relations
between 0-shifted symplectic spaces appear in physics in many places, see e.g. [BW97; Arv23].
1.2.2 Linear logic
The category of linear Lagrangian is extensively studied in linear logic. It has known presentations
by generators and relations and is related to quantum computing, electrical circuits and others; see
[CK22] and the recent survey in [BCC24].
Recently, the category of coisotropic relations was studied by Lorand and Weinstein [LW16], and
in the linear logic community by Booth, Carette, and Comfort [BCC24; Com23], althought their
physical motivation is different—coisotropic relations are related to “discarding” in quantum comput-
ing. It would be interesting to extend their approach to the ( −1)-shifted case and graded coisotropic
correspondences, as well as half-densities.
1.2.3 Shifted symplectic geometry
The work of Gwilliam and Haugseng [GH16] on linear BV quantization should be closely related to
ours. They consider a category Quad1of vector spaces ( V,ω) (or more generally modules over a
cdga) with a degree 1 pairing; while 1-morphisms are given by linear maps V→V′together with a
homotopy between ωand the pullback of ω′. Truncation ofQuad to a 1-category, or its image under
theH∞functor, should be compared to our category LinQSymp−1(up to taking duals, to match
conventions). However, at the moment, we don’t understand e.g. how to get a generalized Lagrangian
from the data of a 1-morphism in Quad1.
In shifted geometric quantization, it was noted by Safronov [Saf23] that the path integral pairing
(2) of an observable with a Lagrangian should be compared to the ( −1)-shifted geometric quantization
for a given prequantization and polarization. Concretely, the following diagram is compared to (2)
[Saf23] in
∗ Ωω(X) ∗prequantization polarization
with the middle object being ( ω-twisted differential forms, or half-densities on) a ( −1)-shifted sym-
plectic space. It is therefore natural to ask whether there exists a coisotropic generalization of polar-
izations.
41.2.4 Homotopy transfer
One can also understand the present work as providing an invariant geometric language for homotopy
transfer (of quantum L∞algebras). Special deformation retracts or abstract Hodge decompositions
[CL09], are a basic object in the theory of homological perturbations5[Cra04; Mar01a], as they can
be used to transfer algebraic structures along homotopy equivalences. We prove in Proposition 3.15
that symplectic special deformation retracts are in bijection non-degenerate reductions, an arguably
more natural notion. It would be interesting to see if more of the theory of homotopy transfer has
similar interpretation.
1.2.5 Non-linear generalizations
A natural generalization of the present category is to allow non-linear Lagrangian submanifolds of the
product as morphisms between ( −1)-shifted symplectic manifolds. This would allow for more general
non-strict morphisms of quantum L∞algebras, such as the non-linear symplectic diffeomoprhism
constructed in [DJP19, Sec. 4.3.1] which gives a homotopy to the effective action. A notion of formal
non-linear Lagrangian relations in the context of BV formalism were introduced under the name of
thick ormicroformal morphisms by T. Voronov in [Vor17].
1.2.6 Morphisms of quantum L∞algebras
Finally, there are other notions of morphisms of quantum L∞algebras which we can encode using
the linear category LinQSymp−1. For example, we would like to examine post-compositions with
generalized Lagrangians not given by Lagrangian relations, as in the beginning of Section 4.4, or
construct spans as in Remark 4.18. Moreover, we see a hint of a 2-categorical structure naturally
appearing in Remark 4.5, it would be interesting to extend it further. Some of these constructions
appear to have better properties in the non-linear setting. We plan to adress this in a future work.

2 Linear (−1)-Symplectic Category
We start by recalling some elementary definitions from graded linear algebra over the field R.
Agraded vector space Vis a direct sum of real vector spaces V=⨁︁
i∈ZVi; we will always
assume that Vis finite-dimesional.6The zero-dimensional vector space will be denoted by ∗. Elements
v∈Vi⊂Vare called homogeneous of degree |v|=i. The degree shift7is denoted ( V[j])i=Vi−j. The
graded dual V∗is defined to have a reflected degree: ( V∗)i= (V−i)∗. A linear map fis said to have
5See [DJP19, Sec. 1] for an overview of the history of homological perturbation theory.
6The results in Section 2 hold with a weaker condition that Vis of finite type, i.e. Viis finite-dimensional for all i.
7This means that V⊕V∗[k] will have a pairing of degree −k. This matches e.g. the convention of [Wei94, Sec. 1.2.8]
for cochain complexes.
5degreek∈Zif|f(v)|=|v|+kfor any homogeneous element v∈V. A morphism of graded vector
spaces is a linear map of degree 0. Linear maps V→Wof degreekcan be thought of as morphisms
inGrVect (V[k],W). A subspace of a graded vector space W⊆Vis a linear subspace embedded by
a morphism of graded vector spaces. The annihilator of W⊂Vis a graded subspace Ann( W)⊂V∗
with graded components
(Ann(W))k={α∈(V∗)k|α⃓⃓
W= 0}.
Note that in the category GrVect , short exact sequences are well-defined and always split. This is
inherited from the category of finite-dimensional real vector spaces Vect degree-wise.
Definition 2.1. Thedimensional generating function is defined as the formal power series
DV(s):=∑︂
k∈Z(dimVk)sk∈R[[s]]. ▲
This object caries all the information of Vinvariant under morphisms of graded vector spaces.
Such notation is convenient for manipulations with degree shifts and degree reflections.
Lemma 2.2. LetV,W be graded vector spaces, k∈Z. Then
1.DV×W(s) = DV(s) + DW(s),
2.DV[k](s) =skDV(s),
3.DV∗(s) = DV(s−1).
4. Given an invertible linear map f:V→Wof degreek, i.e. equivalently an invertible morphism
inGrVect (V[k],W), we have
skDV(s) = DV[k](s) = DW(s).
5. ForW⊂Va graded subspace, DV/W(s) = DV(s)−DW(s).
2.1 (−1)-Shifted Symplectic Vector Spaces
We will focus on linear symplectic structures of degree −1 (also known as P-structures8).
Definition 2.3. A (−1)-shifted symplectic vector space or just (−1)-symplectic vector space
is a graded vector space Vequipped with a non-degenerate graded-antisymmetric bilinear map ω:
V×V→Rof degree|ω|=−1. In other words, a bilinear map such that for all v,w∈V,
1.ω(v,w)̸= 0 only if|v|+|w|= 1,
2.ω(w,v) =−(−1)|w||v|ω(v,w) =−ω(v,w).
An isomorphism of graded vector spaces f: (V,ωV)→(W,ωW) is said to be a symplectic isomor-
phism iff∗ωW=ωV. ▲
Remark 2.4. The existence of a symplectic structure with a non-zero degree imposes conditions on
dimensionality of V. Since the map V→V∗given byx↦→ω(x,−)is an isomorphism of degree
|ω|=−1, by Lemma 2.2 we have
sDV(s−1) = DV(s).
8This is an odd(-shifted) symplectic structure. Note that even(-shifted) symplectic structures have perhaps analogous
but different behaviour; see [Roy99] for their role in generalized geometry.
6Example 2.5. DefineT∗[1]W:=W∗[1]⊕W, theshifted cotangent bundle ofW∈GrVect , with
the cotangent fiber vectors shifted by +1. The canonical symplectic structure ωcangiven by
ωcan(α⊕v,α′⊕v′) =α(v′)−α′(v)
is a (−1)-shifted symplectic structure. In case Wis purely even, the cotangent fibers are purely
odd. In fact, every ( −1)-shifted symplectic vector space Vis linearly symplectomorphic to such odd
cotangent bundle. For example, we can choose W=⨁︁
k≤0VkorW=⨁︁
k∈ZV2kas the base, and
x↦→ω(x,−) is a symplectic isomorphism between the remaining graded components of VandW∗[1].
Schwarz [Sch93a, Theorem 3] proved a more general statement extending the setting to the category
of supermanifolds. The idea is that since the odd directions are de Rham exact, a Moser path method
argument can be carried out to identify all odd symplectic structures with the canonical one up to
symplectomorphism.
Definition 2.6 (see e.g. [MS17, Sec. 2.1]) .We define the symplectic complement of a subspace
W⊆(V,ω) by
Wω={v∈V|ω(v,w) = 0,∀w∈W}.
We say a subspace Wis
•isotropic ifW⊆Wω,
•coisotropic ifWω⊆W,
•Lagrangian ifW=Wω,
•symplectic ifW∩Wω= 0.
Equivalently, a subspace Wis symplectic if ωrestricts to a non-degenerate pairing on W. ▲
Example 2.7. LetVbe a graded vectors space and W⊂Va graded subspace. The shifted conormal
bundle ofW, given by
N∗[1]W= Ann(W)[1]⊕W⊂T∗[1]V=V∗[1]⊕V
is a Lagrangian subspace of T∗[1]Vfrom Example 2.5. Note that in the setting of odd symplectic
supermanifolds, Schwarz [Sch93a, Theorem 4] proved that any Lagrangian submanifold of T∗[1]Mcan
be smoothly deformed into the shifted conormal bundle of a submanifold of M.
Definition 2.8. Acoisotropic reduction of a coisotropic subspace Cis the quotient space C/Cω
together with the symplectic structure ωRinduced on C/Cω,
(V,ω)ι←↩Cπ→(C/Cω,ωR),such that ι∗ω=π∗ωR. ▲
We will often omit ιand writeι(c)≡cforc∈C. Let us record a simple but useful lemma from
[Wei77, Lecture 3] which translates verbatim to the ( −1)-shifted setting.
Lemma 2.9. ForC⊂Vcoisotropic and L⊂VLagrangian, the image of L∩CinC/Cω, denoted
[L]C, is Lagrangian.
Proof. [L]ω
Cis the image in C/Cωof (L∩C)ω∩C= (L+Cω)∩C=L∩C+Cω, where the last
equality holds since Cω⊂C. ■
Example 2.10. Let us consider a ( −1)-shifted symplectic vector space ( V,ω). A compatible9differ-
ential is a differential Q:V→Vsuch thatω(Qx,y ) + (−1)|x|ω(x,Qy ) = 0. Then Im Qis isotropic,
9I.e.ω:V⊗V→R[1] is a chain map.
7asω(Qx,Qy ) =±ω(x,Q2y) = 0. Elements of the symplectic complement v∈(ImQ)ωhave to satisfy,
for anyx∈V;
ω(Qx,v ) = 0,equivalently ω(x,Qv ) = 0,or equivalently Qv= 0.
This means that (Im Q)ω= KerQ. Thus, the cohomology of Qis also the coisotropic reduction of
KerQ. In this example, the differential is zero when restricted to the isotropic subspace Im Q; we
will be mostly interested in isotropic subspaces I⊂Vsuch that Ker Q∩I={0}, i.e. the opposite
situation.
Similarly to the classical case, we can equivalently describe a Lagrangian subspace as a (co)isotrope
with appropriate dimensionality. Note that in the graded case, only the sums dim Lk+ dimL−k+1
are determined for Lagrangian L.
Lemma 2.11. LetWbe a graded subspace of a (−1)-shifted symplectic vector space (V,ω). Then
s−1DWω(s) = DV(s−1)−DW(s−1) (3)
and in particular, an isotropic (or coisotropic) subspace L⊂Vis Lagrangian if and only if
s−1DL(s) = DV(s−1)−DL(s−1).
Proof. The mapx↦→ω(x,−) restricts to an isomorphism Wω∼→Ann(W) of degree−1, thus by
Lemma 2.2 we have
DAnn(W)(s) =s−1DWω(s).
Finally, from W∗∼=V∗/Ann(W), we have D V(s−1) = DW(s−1) + D Ann(W)(s) and equation (3)
follows. For the second part of the lemma, L⊆Lω(orLω⊆L) and DL(s) = DLω(s) together imply
L=Lω. ■
Lemma 2.12. (Wω)ω=W
Proof. Clearly,W⊆(Wω)ω. By double application of Lemma 2.11 and Remark 2.4, D (Wω)ω(s) =
DW(s). Together, these observations yield the statement. ■
2.1.1 Coisotropes and Non-canonical Decompositions
Given a coisotropic subspace C⊂V, the quotient C/Cωhas again a natural degree −1 symplectic
form as in Definition 2.8. We will now show that Vis isomorphic to C/Cω⊕T∗[1]Cωin a non-canonical
way. ForCLagrangian, this implies that Lagrangian complements always exist.
Proposition 2.13. LetC⊆(V,ω)be a coisotropic subspace. Denote I:=Cω⊆Cits isotropic
complement. Then, there exist complements10B⊂VofCandR⊂CofIsuch that
1.RandRω=I⊕Bare symplectic subspaces of V,
2.I,Bare Lagrangian subspaces of I⊕B.
In other words, we have a (non-canonical) direct sum decomposition
V=R⊕I⊕Bwithω=⎛
⎝ωR 0 0
0 0ω′′
0−ω′′0⎞
⎠,

ment ofCsatisfying

To check that IandBare Lagrangian subspaces of I⊕B∼=Rω, we check the condition from
Lemma 2.11,
s−1DI(s)?= DI⊕B(s−1)−DI(s−1) = DB(s−1),
s−1DB(s)?= DI⊕B(s−1)−DB(s−1) = DI(s−1).
These equalities follow from equation (4). ■
2.2 Linear and Lagrangian Relations
Recall that a linear relation between vector spaces UandVis a linear subspace L⊂U×V. This
defines the category LinRel of real finite-dimensional vector spaces and linear relations. Identity is
given by the diagonal diag( −) and composition as the set-theoretic composition,
L2◦L1:={(u,w)∈U×W|∃v∈Vsuch that (u,v)∈L1and (v,w)∈L2}. (5)
The image and kernel of a linear relation L⊂U×Vare defined by
ImL:={v∈V|∃u∈U: (u,v)∈L},
KerL:={u∈U|(u,0)∈L}.
A transpose of a linear relation L⊂U×Vis
LT:={(v,u)∈V×U|(u,v)∈L⊂U×V}.
Lis called injective if KerL= 0,surjective if ImL=V,coinjective if KerLT= 0 and cosurjec-
tive if ImLT=U. The relation Lis a graph of a linear map U→Vif and only if Lis cosurjective
and coinjective. If this condition is not satisfied, one should view Las a partially defined ,multi-valued
map; the domain of definition is ImLT, and the indeterminacy is KerLT(see e.g. [Lan61]).
For a (−1)-shifted symplectic vector space ( V,ω), defineVas the same graded vector space with
an opposite symplectic form −ω.
Definition 2.14. The objects of the linear (−1)-symplectic category LinSymp−1are (−1)-shifted
symplectic vector spaces and morphisms from VtoWareLagrangian relations , i.e. Lagrangian
subspaces of V×W. The identity morphism is given by the diagonal diag( V)⊆V×V. Composition
of
UVWL1L2
is defined as a composition of relations of sets from equation (5). ▲
9Example 2.15. The basic example of a Lagrangian relation is the graph Gr ϕ⊆V×Wof a symplectic
isomorphism ϕ:V→W, In fact, all isomorpisms in LinSymp−1are obtained as such graphs, and the
functor Gr (−)identifies the category of symplectomorphisms with the maximal subgroupoid (the core)
ofLinSymp−1. We will often denote these isomorphisms by a decorated arrow (see also Definition 2.20)
VW.Grϕ
Lemma 2.16. The category LinSymp−1is well-defined.
Proof. The diagonal relation is Lagrangian and satisfies the identity axiom. Composition of set-
theoretic relations is associative, and composing two linear relations gives again a linear relation.
To check that composition of two Lagrangian relations is Lagrangian, we can use Lemma 2.9 as in
Weinstein [Wei77, Lecture 3]. The subspace C=U×diag(V)×W⊂U×V×V×Wis coisotropic,
and its coisotropic reduction is U×diag(V)×W/(∗×diag(V)×∗)∼=U×W. The image [ L1×L2]Cof
the Lagrangian L1×L2⊂U×V×V×WisL2◦L1, which is therefore Lagrangian by Lemma 2.9. ■
Remark 2.17 (Dagger compact closed category) .The transpose L↦→LTdefines a dagger on the
symmetric monoidal category (LinSymp−1,×)[Sel07, Def 2.2]. Moreover, with Vas the dual object of
V,LinSymp−1is a compact closed category, i.e. the internal hom [V1,V2]can be computed as V1×V2
[KL80]. Finally, these are compatible as in [Sel07, Def. 2.6], i.e. LinSymp−1is dagger compact closed.
Dagger compact closed categories (originally introduced as strongly compact closed categories) are a
natural setting for (finite-dimensional) quantum mechanics, as proposed by Abramsky and Coecke
[AC04; AC09].
Example 2.18 (Odd version of [GS13, Theorem 4.8.1]) .There is a shifted cotangent functor
T∗[1]:GrVect→LinSymp−1,
defined on objects by V↦→(T∗[1]V,ω can) and on morphisms by sending f:V→Wto the Lagrangian
T∗[1]f={(β◦f,v,β,f (v))|v∈V,β∈W∗} ⊂V∗[1]⊕V⊕W∗[1]⊕W=T∗[1]V⊕T∗[1]W.
We end this section by showing that each Lagrangian relation has a coisotropic image, with the
corresponding isotrope being the kernel of the transposed relation (see e.g. [GS79, p. 945]).
Lemma 2.19. LetL: (U,ωU)→(V,ωV)be a Lagrangian relation. Then
KerLT= (ImL)ωVand KerL=(︁
ImLT)︁ωU.
In particular, for a Lagrangian relation, surjectivity is equivalent to coinjectivity and injectivity is
equivalent to cosurjectivity.
Proof. By definition, v∈KerLTif and only if (0 ,v)∈L=Lω. Equivalently, for all ( u′,v′)∈L,
0 =−ωU⊕ωV((0,v),(u′,v′)) =−ωU(0,u′) +ωV(v,v′) =ωV(v,v′).
Thereforev∈KerLTif and only if v∈(ImL)ωV. The second equation is proven from the first by
considering LTin place ofL. ■
2.3 Reductions and Coreductions
Definition 2.20. LetL∈U→Vbe a Lagrangian relation. We say Lis
•areduction , if KerLT= 0 (equivalently Im L=V) and we denote UL− → →V,
•acoreduction , if KerL= 0 (equivalently Im LT=V) and we denote UVL. ▲
10Some useful properties follow from the definition:
•A composition of (co)reductions is a (co)reduction.
•A Lagrangian relation is both a reduction and a coreduction UVLif and only if it is an
isomorphism in LinSymp−1(i.e. a graph of a symplectic isomorphism).
•A Lagrangian relation L:U→Vis a reduction if and only if L◦LT= 1V, and a coreduction
if and only if LT◦L= 1U. Moreover, reductions are epimorphisms and coreductions are
monomorphisms in LinSymp−1(see Remark 2.24). We will denote the subcategory of reductions
(epimorphisms) by Red−1.
The following proposition shows that every reduction is equal to coisotropic reduction red Cfrom
Definition 2.8 up to a post-composition by a symplectic isomorphism
VRL=(︃
V ImLT/KerLRredImLT)︃
.
This is a straightforward modification of [GS13, Prop. 3.4.2].
Proposition 2.21 (Reductions are coisotropic reductions) .LetV,R∈LinSymp−1,L⊆V×Ra
graded subspace. Then the following two conditions are equivalent.
1.L∈LinSymp−1(V,R)and it is a reduction.
2. There exists C⊆Vcoisotropic and a symplectic isomorphism ϕ:C/Cω∼=− →Rsuch that
L={︁
(c,r)∈V×R|c∈C,r=ϕ(π(c))}︁
.
whereπ:C→C/Cωis the quotient map.
Proof. First, we suppose condition 2 holds. The relation Lis surjective by definition; let us prove
thatLis indeed a Lagrangian relation. Denote πR≡ϕ◦π. Sinceϕis a symplectomorphism, we have
ω⃓⃓
C=π∗
RωR. From this, the isotropy of Lfollows:
−ω⊕ωR((c,πRc),(c′,πRc′)) =−ω(c,c′) +π∗
RωR(c,c′) = 0,for allc,c′∈C.
To show that Lis coisotropic, let us take arbitrary ( v,πR(d))∈Lωwithv∈V,d∈C. This element
satisifes, for any c∈C,
0 =−ω(v,c) +ωR(πR(d),πR(c)) =ω(d−v,c).
In other words, v−d∈Cωand sinced∈C, thenv∈Cas well and π(v) =π(d), which means that
Lω⊂L.
Now let condition 1 hold and VL− → →Rbe a reduction, denote C≡ImLT. By Lemma 2.19, Cis
coisotropic:
(ImLT)ω= KerL⊆ImLT.
By coinjectivity of L, there exists a map πR:C→Rsuch thatL={︁
(c,πR(c))∈V×R|c∈C}︁
.
The projection πRuniquely factors through π, since Ker π=Cω= KerL= KerπR; the induced
symplectic isomorphism ϕ:C/KerπR→ImπR
C
C
CωRπRπ
ϕ(6)
is uniquely determined by ϕ(π(c)) =πR(c). ■
11In other words, given a reduction VL− → →R, the coisotrope Cis unique since it is determined by
ImLT, and the symplectic isomorphism ϕ:C/Cω∼=Ris unique, as Gr ϕis necessarily equal to the
composition

since Grϕ◦redC=Limplies Gr ϕ◦redC◦redT

C= 1for a reduction red C.
2.3.1 Factorization
Crucially, it turns out that any Lagrangian relation can be factored into a reduction followed by a
coreduction, with coisotropics given by Im LTand ImLrespectively. This is a ( −1)-shifted symplectic
version of the usual claim for linear relations [Lan61, p. 1045] or Lagrangian relations [GS79, p. 946].
Proposition 2.22. LetL∈LinSymp−1(U,V). LetLUandLVbe the coisotropic reductions with
respect to ImLT⊂UandImL⊂V, respectively. Then LV◦L◦LT
U=: Grϕis an isomorphism and
the following diagram commutes.
U V
ImLT/KerL ImL/KerLTLUL
GrϕLT
V(8)
Moreover, this factorization is unique in the following sense. For every factorization L=LT
2◦L1
whereL1:U− → →R,L2:V− → →Rare reductions, there are unique isomorphisms ψ1,ψ2making the
following diagram commute.
U V
R
ImLT/KerL ImL/KerLTL
L1 LT
2
LU LT
V
∃! Grψ1∃! Grψ2
Grϕ(9)
Proof. By Lemma 2.19, Im LTis coisotropic in Uand ImLinV. Thus the quotients RU:=
ImLT/KerLandRV:= ImL/KerLTare (−1)-shifted symplectic and define reductions LUand
LVby Proposition 2.21. Denote the quotient maps by πU: ImLT→RU,πV: ImL→RVand the
composition by Φ := LV◦L◦LT
U⊂RU×RV. In this notation,
Φ ={︁
(r,s)∈RU×RV|∃(u,v)∈L:r=πU(u),s=πV(v)}︁
.
To show that Φ is an isomorphism, it suffices to notice that Φ is both surjective and cosurjective, and
hence Φ = Gr ϕfor a symplectic isomorphism ϕ:RU→RV. To check that diagram (8) commutes,
it is easy to see that L⊂LT
V◦Φ◦LU, which implies equality of these two Lagrangian subspaces of
U×V.
Turning to (9), for any such factorization L=LT
2◦L1, we have Im(︁
LT
2◦L1)︁
= ImLT
2, sinceL1
is surjective. Thus, the coisotrope giving the reduction L2in necessarily equal to Im L, and similarly
ImLT
1= ImLT. By Proposition 2.21, we get unique ψ1,2making the left and right triangles in (9)
commute. The bottom triangle commutes since the whole square commutes and we have (7). ■
12Example 2.23. Continuing Example 2.18, we can interpret Proposition 2.22 for linear maps. If
L=T∗[1]fforf:U→V, we get
KerL= 0⊕Kerf⊂U∗[1]⊕U, ImL=V∗⊕Imf⊂V∗[1]⊕V,
KerLT= Kerft⊕0⊂V∗[1]⊕V, ImLT= Imft⊕U⊂U∗[1]⊕U.
Then, Lemma 2.19 says that Ker ft= Ann(Im f), while Proposition 2.22 gives the isomorphism
U/Kerf∼=Imf.
Remark 2.24 (Epimorphisms are reductions) .We can now show that not only a reduction Lsatisfies
L◦LT= 1and is therefore an epimorphism, but the other implication is also true. We can decompose
any epimorphism L∈LinSymp−1(U,V)asL=LT
V◦LU=LT
V◦LV◦LT
V◦LUwhereLUandLV
are reductions. Since Lis epic, we have LT
V◦LV= 1Vand thusLVis an isomorphism and Lis a
reduction.
Definition 2.25. Given a Lagrangian relation L:U→V, we define its factorization cospan to be
a pair of reductions ( LU,LV)
U V
RLUL
LV(10)
such that
L=LT
V◦LU. ▲
Proposition 2.22 shows that a factorization cospan always exists and moreover, for a fixed relation
L, all factorization cospans are uniquely isomorphic in the sense of diagram (9); we will speak of the
factorization cospan of a Lagrangian relation. Note that since LV◦LT
V= 1V, the diagram (10) is
commutative in LinSymp−1.
2.4 Spans of Reductions
If we have two Lagrangian relations UL1−−→VL2−−→W, we can form their factorization cospans and get
the following diagram in LinSymp−1.
U V W
R ˜︁RL1 L2
L ˜︁L (11)
Let us now investigate two natural questions connected with diagram (11): whether we can complete
thespan of reductions R← ← −V− → →˜︁Rto a commutative square, and how this square relates to the
usual definition of a composition of cospans in terms of pushouts [B´ en67, Sec. I.2.6]. We will answer
these questions in Corollary 2.30.
Let us therefore consider an arbitrary span of reductions , i.e. is a pair of reductions ( L,˜︁L) with
a common source.
V
R ˜︁RL ˜︁L (12)
Transposing L, we get a relation ˜︁L◦LT:R→˜︁R, which can be easily described as
˜︁L◦LT={(πR(c),π˜︁R(c))|c∈C∩˜︁C}⊂R×˜︁R, (13)
whereC:= ImLTandπR:C→Rare the coisotrope and projections such that L={(πR(c),c)|c∈
C}using the notation from diagram (6) (and analogously for ˜︁Candπ˜︁R).
132.4.1 Orthogonal Spans of Reductions
There is a natural choice of the completion of diagram (12) to a square, namely the factorization
cospanR− → →S0← ← −˜︁Rof the composite ˜︁L◦LT:R→˜︁R. However, the resulting square of reductions
is not always commutative.11We will now completely characterize the class of spans of reductions for
which this happens.
Definition 2.26. We say a span of reductions R←L← −V˜︁L− → →˜︁Risorthogonal if KerL⊥Ker˜︁L, i.e. if
for alli∈KerL,˜︁i∈Ker˜︁L,
ω(i,˜︁i) = 0. ▲
DenoteI:= KerLand˜︁I:= Ker˜︁L. Observe that I⊥˜︁Iis equivalent to I+˜︁Ibeing isotropic, which is
in turn equivalent to C∩˜︁Cbeing coisotropic, since C∩˜︁C= (I+˜︁I)ω.
Theorem 2.27. Consider a span of reductions R←L← −V˜︁L− → →˜︁R. Then the factorization cospan
R ˜︁R
S0K0˜︁L◦LT
˜︁K0
makes the square of reductions (14) commute if and only if (L,˜︁L)is an orthogonal span of reductions.
V
R ˜︁R
S0L ˜︁L
K0 ˜︁K0(14)
Moreover, any cone of reductions under an orthogonal span of reductions (L,˜︁L)uniquely factors
through the cone (14). In other words, the pushout of (12) in the category of reductions exists if and
only if the span of reductions is orthogonal, and it is given by the factorization cospan of ˜︁L◦LT.
A cone of reductions ˜︁R− → →S← ← −˜︁Runder (L,˜︁L) is equivalently given by a reduction M:V− → →S
which factors through both Land˜︁L. We will thus first study the problem of factoring one reduction
through another; Theorem 2.27 will follow by applying the following proposition twice.
Proposition 2.28. Consider a pair of reductions L:V− → →RandM:V− → →S.
V
R
SL
M
∃?K
Then the following are equivalent:
(1)Mfactors through L, i.e. there is a reduction K:R− → →Ssuch thatK◦L=M,
11As a counter-example, consider a decomposition V=R⊕I⊕Bfrom Proposition 2.13 let Rand˜︁Rbe reductions
alongR⊕IandR⊕B, respectively. Then ˜︁L◦LT= 1RandS0∼=R, butL̸=˜︁LunlessI=B=∗.
14(2)M◦LT◦L=M,
(3)MT◦M◦LT◦L=MT◦M,
(4)ImMT⊆ImLT.
Moreover, if any of these conditions holds, one has K=M◦LTand thusKis unique if it exists.
Proof. IfKexists, then K◦L=Mimplies that K=M◦LTand thusKis unique. Moreover,
any relation Kmaking the diagram above commute is necessarily a reduction, since K◦L=Mis
surjective.
Let us now show the equivalence of the four statements. The equivalence of (1) and (2) is clear
since we just need to check that K◦L=Mfor our only candidate K=M◦LT. The equivalence of
(2) and (3) is due to M◦MT= 1, asMis a reduction. Finally, let CL:= ImLTandCM:= ImMT,
thenMT◦Mis the relation12
MT◦M={(c,c′)∈CM×CM|c−c′∈(CM)ω}⊆V×V.
Similarly, the composition MT◦M◦LT◦Lis equal to
MT◦M◦LT◦L={(c+iL,c+iM)|c∈CL∩CM,iL∈(CL)ω,iM∈(CM)ω}⊆V×V.
The statement (3) is equivalent to the inclusion MT◦M◦LT◦L⊆MT◦M, as both are Lagrangian
subspaces of V×V. This is in turn equivalent to the following three conditions for all c∈Cr∩CM,
iL∈(CL)ω,iM∈(CM)ω:
c+iL∈CM,
c+iM∈CM,
iL−iM∈(CM)ω.
The last condition is equivalent to ( CL)ω⊆(CM)ω, i.e.CM⊆CL, and this implies the first condition
asc+iL∈CM∩CL+ (CL)ω⊆CM∩CL+ (CM)ω⊆CM. The middle condition is always satisfied.
Thus, the inclusion MT◦M◦LT◦L⊂MT◦Mis equivalent to CM⊆CL, i.e. the statement (4). ■
Proof of Theorem 2.27. Consider an arbitrary cone of reductions, and denote M=K◦L=˜︁K◦˜︁L.
V
R ˜︁R
SL ˜︁L
K ˜︁KM(15)
The reduction Mis given (up to a unique isomorphism of S) by the coisotrope D:= ImMT. From
Proposition 2.28 we see that necessarily D⊂ImLT∩Im˜︁LT, and vice versa choosing coisotropic
D⊂ImLT∩Im˜︁LTgivesKand˜︁Ksuch thatK◦L=M=˜︁K◦˜︁L(again from Proposition 2.28). Thus,
commutative squares of the form (15) (up to an isomorphism in S) are in bijection with coisotropic
subspaces of Im LT∩Im˜︁LT. In particular, such commutative squares exist if and only if Im LT∩Im˜︁LT
is itself coisotropic,13i.e. if (L,˜︁L) is an orthogonal span of reductions.
12In fact, the assignemt CM↦→MT◦Mgives a bijection between coisotropic subspaces M⊂Vand symmetric
idempotent endomorphisms of VinLinSymp−1[GS79, Eq. 9.14]. The present proposition can be understood as saying
that this bijection is order-preserving, with respect to the partial order on idempotents from [Mit86]. See also [Hal57,
§29] for an analogous statement for Hilbert spaces.
13If a subspace E⊂Vcontains a coisotropic subspace C⊂E, thenEis also coisotropic, as Eω⊂Cω⊂C⊂E.
15Next, we show that the case D0= ImLT∩Im˜︁LTcorresponds to ( K0,˜︁K0) being the factorization
cospan of ˜︁L◦LT. By uniqueness of factorization from Proposition 2.22, it is enough to check that
˜︁L◦L=˜︁KT
0◦K0. The relation ˜︁L◦Lis given by (13),
˜︁L◦LT={(πR(c),π˜︁R(c))|c∈C∩˜︁C}⊂R×˜︁R,
while˜︁KT
0◦K0is equal to
˜︁KT
0◦K0=˜︁L◦MT
0◦M0◦LT={(πR(c1),π˜︁R(c2))|c1,c2∈C∩˜︁C,c1−c2∈(C∩˜︁C)ω}∈R×˜︁R.
By choosing c1=c2, we see that ˜︁L◦LT⊂˜︁KT
0◦K0, which proves the equality of these Lagrangian
subspaces of R×˜︁R.
To prove the pushout property of this square, consider an arbitrary commutative square of reduc-
tions (the outer square on the diagram).
V
RS0˜︁R
SL˜︁L
K ˜︁KK0˜︁K0

To showS0is a pushout, we need to construct Nas above and check that it is a map of cocones. The
reductionNis constructed by factorizing M=K◦L=˜︁K◦˜︁LthroughM0, which exists and is unique
by Proposition 2.28. Finally, we need to check K=N◦K0, which is equivalent to K◦L=N◦K0◦L,
i.e.M=N◦M0, and similarly for ˜︁K=N◦˜︁K0. ■
2.5 Category of Cospans of Reductions
Recall from Section 2.4 that we wanted to investigate the factorization cospan of a composition. Let
us consider diagram (11) and add the factorization of ˜︁L◦LTto the bottom.14
U V W
R ˜︁R
SL1 L2
LT ˜︁L
K ˜︁KT(16)
Since the square and the two triangles commute, the outer triangle gives the factorization cospan
ofL2◦L1, by uniqueness of factorizations from Proposition 2.22. This way, we have defined the
composition of morphisms in the following category.
Definition 2.29. Thecategory of cospans of reductions , denoted CospanRed−1, has (−1)-
symplectic vector spaces as objects and isomorphism classes of cospans of reductions as morphisms. ▲
Usually, the composition in the category of cospans is defined using pushouts. Theorem 2.27 says
these two compositions agree exactly when the pushout is defined, i.e. when ( L,˜︁L) is an orthogonal
span of reductions. We now summarize these results in the following corollary.
14We drop the subscript 0, which denoted the factorization cospan in the previous section, to lighten the notation.
16Corollary 2.30 (Factorization cospan as an equivalence of categories) .There is an equivalence of
categories between the linear (−1)-shifted symplectic category and the category of isomorphism classes
of cospans of reductions in the linear (−1)-shifted symplectic category given by the construction of the
factorization cospan;
LinSymp−1∼=CospanRed−1.
Moreover, assume the Lagrangian relations L1andL2compose orthogonally , i.e. KerLT
1⊥KerL2.
Then the composition in CospanRed−1coincides with the composition of factorization cospans under
L1andL2along the pushout in the category of reductions Red−1, as displayed in diagram (17).
U V W
R ˜︁R
R′L1 L2
L ˜︁L
K ˜︁K
⌟(17)
Proof. The first part follows from Proposition 2.22 and the construction above. For the second
part,L1andL2compose orthogonally if and only if ( L,˜︁L) is an orthogonal span of reductions.
This assumption enables us to transpose any coreductions in the diagram (16) into reductions while
preserving its commutativity, using Theorem 2.27. ■
3 Half-Densities and Perturbative BV Integration
In the previous section, the degree of the symplectic form did not play a big role, apart from some
complications when calculating dimensions. In this chapter, we will introduce notions for which it is
essential that the symplectic form has an odd degree: half-densities and their perturbative Batalin-
Vilkovisky integrals. Our goal is to define a fiber Batalin-Vilkovisky integral along a reduction.
3.1 Linear Half-Densities
Densities on graded vector spaces15are real-valued functions on the set of bases, transforming with
the Berezinian. In general, Berezinian is defined for even automorphisms of free modules over a
commutative superalgebra [Man10, Sec. 3.3]. We will restrict to the case of linear automorphisms
of graded vector spaces, where the usual formula simplifies as follows. We will also replace the field
Rwith the field R((ℏ)) of formal Laurent series in powers of ℏto simplify ℏ-dependent calculations.
Unless it is explicitely denoted otherwise, the tensor product ⊗is understood over R((ℏ)).
Definition 3.1. LetRbe an invertible degree-preserving linear map on a graded16vector space
V=Veven⊕Vodd, which naturally decomposes into R=Reven⊕Rodd. We define the Berezinian of
Ras
Ber (R) =detReven
detRodd. ▲
We list some simple properties:
•Ber (R1R2) = Ber (R1) Ber (R2), Ber(︁
R−1)︁
= Ber (R)−1,
•Ber(︁
RT)︁
= Ber (R),
•Ber (R1⊕R2) = Ber (R1) Ber (R2),
15Recall that we now assume that our vector spaces are finite-dimensional.
16Graded in Z, which induces a Z2-grading by parity.
17•ForVa (−1)-shifted symplectic space and R:V→Va symplectic isomorphism, Ber ( R) =
(detReven)2.
Definition 3.2. Letebe a basis of a graded vector space VandRan invertible map acting naturally
onefrom the right. A linear density of weight α∈RonVis a mapρ:e↦→ρ(e)∈R((ℏ))
satisfying
ρ(e·R) =|Ber (R)|αρ(e).
We denote the one-dimensional vector space of linear densities of weight αonVby|V|α. ForV=∗
a point, we define17|∗|α=R((ℏ)). We call elements of |V|1
2linear half-densities .18▲
There is a natural notion of multiplication of densities: ( ρ·σ)(e):=ρ(e)σ(e). We can use this to
identify a priori different spaces of linear densities.
Lemma 3.3. There are following canonical isomorphisms (which we will denote by the “ =” sign).
|V|α⊗|V|β=|V|α+β,|V|α=|V∗|−α,|V|α=|V[1]|−α.
Proof. The first isomorphism is the multiplication of densities. The second isomorphism sends a
densityρ∈|V|αto the density ˜︁ρ(e∗):=ρ(e), where e∗⊂V∗is the dual basis to e⊂V. Transforming
ebyRtransforms e∗by (R−1)T, hence ˜︁ρhas weight−α. The last isomorphism follows form the fact
that exchanging Reven↔Roddinverts the Berezinian. ■
Lemma 3.4. A short exact sequences of graded vector spaces of the form
0UVW 0ip
induces a canonical isomorphism |V|α=|U|α⊗|W|α.
Proof. Analogously to the classical case [GS13]. Different extensions of a basis of i(U) toVdiffer only
by an action of Rwith upper triangular block matrix structure on U⊕W. Since the block structure
is induced on both Ueven⊕WevenandUodd⊕Wodd, the Berezinian does not depend on the choice of
such extension. Then, by Ber ( R′⊕R) = Ber (R′) Ber (R), the Lemma follows. ■
Since in GrVect ,U⊕W∼=U×W, a simple corollary of Lemma 3.4 is
|U×W|α=|U|α⊗|W|α.
3.1.1 Linear Half-densities and Measures on Kernels of Lagrangian Relations
One reason for introducing half-densities is that they induce densities on Lagrangian subspaces. In-
deed, for a Lagrangian subspace L⊂V, there is a following sequence of canonical isomorphisms (due
to [Sch93a, Eq. (30)], [Khu04, Eq. (3.5)] and [KV08, Sec. 3]).
|V|1
2∼=|L|1
2⊗|V/L|1
2∼=|L|1
2⊗|L∗[1]|1
2∼=|L|1
2⊗|L|1
2∼=|L|,
where we used Lemmata 3.3 and 3.4. The isomorphism V/L∼=L∗[1] is given by [ v]↦→ω(v,−). The
appearence of the shift L∗[1] highlights the difference between even and odd symplectic geometry.19
This argument can be generalized to a more general reduction V− → →Rinstead ofL:V− → →∗.
Lemma 3.5. LetI⊂Vbe an isotropic subspace, C:=IωandR:=C/I. Then there’s a canonical
isomorphism|V|1

2⊗|I|.
17Motivated by the fact that a zero-dimensional vector space has a unique basis, or by Lemma 3.4 with W= 0.
18On (−1)-shifted symplectic vector spaces, they are the natural objects to integrate along Lagrangian subspaces, see
Section 3.1.1.
19For classical even ω, we get|V|α=|L|α⊗|L∗|α=|L|α⊗|L|−α=R, that is a proof of the existence of canonical
symplectic volume.

3.2 Formal Functions
A central part of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism are integrals of functions of the form eS/ℏ. In order
to accomodate such functions and their products, we will consider formal polynomials in V∗andℏ±1,
completed with respect to the weight grading of [BM18, Sec. 2.2], see [DJP19, Sec. 2.2] for an analysis
that easily translates to our setting.
Theweight of a homogeneous element
f∈Symk(V∗)⊗RRℏg⊂ˆ︃Sym(V∗)[[ℏ,ℏ−1]]
is defined to be w= 2g+k. Here, Symkis the graded-symmetric algebra given by the quotient of
V⊗kby the ideal generated by elements of the form α⊗β−(−1)|α||β|β⊗αand Sym0(V)≡Rby
definition. The hat ˆ︃Sym denotes the completion of the space of polynomial elements to formal series.
Definition 3.6. LetFwVbe the space of finite linear combinations of homogeneous weight welements
FwV:=⨁︂
k≥0
g∈Z
2g+k=wSymk(V∗)⊗RRℏg.
We define the space of formal functions on a graded vector space Vas the space of formal series
with weight bounded from below
FV:={︂
f∈∏︂
w∈ZFwV|the weight components of fvanish forw<Nffor someNf∈Z}︂
.▲
This way,FVis an algebra, and the product preserves the weight grading. We would like to emphasize
that the weight grading just solves a technical triviality.
3.2.1 BV Algebra
We will now briefly recall the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure [BV81] on the space FV, see [DJP19,
Sec. 2.1] for more details. Let {ei}ibe a basis of V∈LinSymp−1,{ϕi}ithe dual basis. We define
the matrix ωij:=ω(ei,ej) and denote its inverse ωij. The algebraFVis then spanned by graded-
commutative polynomials in ϕiandℏ±1.
Definition 3.7. Define the odd Poisson bracket {−,−}:FV×FV→FVby20
{f,g}:=∂Rf
∂ϕiωij∂Lg
∂ϕj,
20Right partial derivatives are defined by
∂RF
∂ϕi= (−1)|i|(|F|−|i|)∂LF
∂ϕi.
19and the BV Laplacian ∆ :FV→FVby
∆:=1
2(−1)|i|ωij∂2
L
∂ϕi∂ϕj.
Both of these maps are defined to be R((ℏ))-linear. ▲
These two operations define a BV algebra structure on FV, i.e.∆is a second-order differential
operator of degree 1 which squares to 0, and {−,−}is a degree 1 Poisson bracket satisfying
∆(fg) = (∆f)g+ (−1)|f|f∆g+ (−1)|f|{f,g}.
Remark 3.8. Using the odd Poisson bracket, we can give yet another equivalent formulation of
orthogonality of spans reductions from Definition 2.26. Let C,˜︁C⊂Vbe two coisotropic subspaces,
with corresponding isotropes I,˜︁I. Define the vanishing ideal ICofCbyIC:=⟨Ann(C)⟩⊆FV.
Then
I⊥˜︁Iif and only if{IC,I˜︁C}⊆IC+I˜︁C.
Finally, we extend the BV Laplacian to the space of all half-densities, to be thought of as the
sections of the square root of the Berezinian bundle over V.
Definition 3.9. The space of half-densitiesD1

The BV Laplacian ∆:D1

2. ▲
Remark 3.10. Note that our definitions imply that for V=∗, the algebraFVis equal to the algebra
of formal Laurent series R((ℏ)), and similarlyD1
2V∼=R((ℏ)).
In fact, it is the space of half-densities on an odd symplectic supermanifold which carries a canonical
BV Laplacian [ ˇSev06]. In our case, when the manifold is the vector space V, there’s a unique-
up-to-rescaling translation-invariant half-density which induces the BV operator on functions from
Definition 3.7.
3.3 (−1)-Shifted Symplectic dg Vector Spaces
We will equip some of the symplectic vector spaces with a compatible differential. However, we would
like to point out that we will not consider symplectic dg vector spaces as objects of a symplectic
category, it will be the morphisms which will carry the differential (see Definition 4.1).
Definition 3.11. A (−1)-shifted symplectic dg vector space is a (−1)-shifted symplectic space
(V,ω) equipped with a degree 1 differential Q:V→Vsuch that for all v,w∈V,
ω(Qv,w ) + (−1)|v|ω(v,Qw ) = 0. ▲
Such differentials are in bijection with elements Sfree∈Sym2(V∗) of degree 0 such that
{Sfree,Sfree}= 0,
i.e.Sfreesatisfies the classical master equation . This bijection is given by21
{Sfree,−}:=Qt
where the transpose of a graded linear map fis defined on ϕ∈V∗byft(ϕ):= (−1)(|f|+1)|ϕ|ϕ◦f. We
will thus use both QandSfreeto refer to a differential on a ( −1)-shifted symplectic vector space.
21If we denote Q(ej) =Qi
jei, Sfree=1
2sijϕiϕjthen the above formula gives Qi
j=−ωikskj. Equivalently, we have
Sfree(v,w) = (−1)|v|ω(Qv,w ).
203.3.1 Non-Degenerate Reductions and Canonical Decomposition
We will now study “non-degenerate” reductions, i.e. reductions along which we can define a per-
turbative Gaussian integral with the kernel given by eSfree/ℏ. In some forms and special cases, this
non-degeneracy condition is well-known among experts and appears e.g. in [Cos11, Lemma 2.5.1,
Section 2.7]. As explained in Proposition 3.15 below, such reductions succinctly encode special defor-
mation retracts of symplectic vector spaces or abstract Hodge decompositions [CL09] in the language
of Lagrangian relations.
Definition 3.12. Let (V,ω,Q ) be a (−1)-shifted symplectic dg vector space and Sfree∈Sym2(V∗)
the corresponding quadratic form. An isotrope I⊂Vis said to be non-degenerate if it satisfies any
of the following equivalent conditions.
•SI
free:=Sfree⃓⃓
I, the restriction of SfreetoI, is a non-degenerate pairing.
•The matrix ω(ei,Qej) is non-degenerate for any basis {ei}ofI.
•I∩(QI)ω={0}.
A reduction L:V− → →Ris said to be a non-degenerate reduction if KerLis non-degenerate. ▲
The utility of this definition is demonstrated in Proposition 3.13, which proves that any non-
degenerate isotrope I⊂Vdetermines a canonical decomposition in the sense of Proposition 2.13,
V= (I⊕QI)ω⊕I⊕QI=:Rcan⊕I⊕B. (18)
Proposition 3.13. LetI⊂Vbe a non-degenerate isotrope with respect to Q. Then:
1.I∩KerQ={0}.
2.I∩QI={0}.
3.QIis isotropic.
4.I⊕QIis symplectic.
5.(I⊕QI)ω⊕I=Iω, thus alsoIω/I∼=(I⊕QI)ω=:Rcan.
6. In the decomposition V=I⊕(I⊕QI)ω⊕QI, the only non-zero components of the differential
QareQ⃓⃓
I:I∼=− →QIand possibly Q⃓⃓
Rcan: (I⊕QI)ω→(I⊕QI)ω.
Proof.
1. If there were a vector i∈I∩KerQ, thenSfree(i,−) =±ω(Qi,−) = 0 and thus SI
freewould be
degenerate.
2. FromQ2= 0, we have I∩QI⊂KerQ∩I, which is zero by the previous point.
3. AsQis compatible with ω, we getω(Qi,Qi′) =±ω(︁
i,Q2i′)︁
= 0 for alli,i′∈I.
4. BySfree=±ω(Q−,−), we have that ω⃓⃓
I⊕QIis block-diagonal with ±SI
freeon anti-diagonals.
Since this matrix is invertible, I⊕QIis symplectic (i.e. it does not intersect its ω-orthogonal
complement).
5. We have I⊂I⊕QI, and so (I⊕QI)ω⊂Iωand alsoI⊂Iω. Together, this gives ( I⊕QI)ω⊕I⊂
Iω. The equality is proven by comparing dimensions. Since Q:L→QLis an isomorphism of
degree 1, we have D QL(s) =sDL(s) Using Lemma 2.11, we get that
D(QI⊕I)ω⊕I(s) =s(DV(s−1)−DQI⊕I(s−1))+DI(s) =s(DV(s−1)−(1+s−1) DI(s−1))+DI(s)
21while
DLω(s) =s(DV(s−1)−DI(s−1)).
The difference is
DI(s)−DI(s−1) =∑︂
k≥1(dimIk−dimI−k)sk,
which vanishes since Ihas a non-degenerate pairing SI
freeof degree 0.
6. We have Q=Q⃓⃓
I+Q⃓⃓
QI+Q⃓⃓
(I⊕QI)ω. The first map is the isomorphism I→QI. The second
map vanishes. The third map lands again in ( I⊕QI)ω, sinceω(Qr,i +Qi′) =±ω(r,Qi) = 0. ■
This decomposition of Vinduces a special deformation retract between VandR, see e.g. [Cra04].
Definition 3.14. Aspecial deformation retract is a pair of dg vector spaces, chain maps i,pand
a degree (−1) mapkas below
(V,QV) (W,QW)p
k
i
such thatpi= 1W,ip= 1V+QVk+kQV,k2= 0,pk= 0 andki= 0. IfVandWare (−1)-shifted
dg symplectic, then we say that the special deformation retract is symplectic ifiis a symplectic
map,pis a Poisson map and ksatisfiesωV(kv,v′) = (−1)|v|ωV(v,kv′). ▲
Finally, we can relate symplectic SDRs, and also abstract Hodge decompositions of Chuang and
Lazarev [CL09, Def. 2.1] with non-degenerate reductions.
Proposition 3.15. There is a bijection between the following structures.
1. Non-degenerate isotropes in V.
2. Symplectic special deformation retracts between Vand someR(up to an isomorphism of R).
3. Abstract Hodge decompositions s,t:V→Vof(V,ω,Q ).
The abstract Hodge decomposition is harmonious (loc.cit.), i.e. Ris isomorphic to the homology of V,
if and only if Q⃓⃓
Rcan= 0.
See [CL09, Proposition 2.5] for a related statement in the harmonious case.
Proof. Given a non-degenerate isotrope I⊂V, one can take define a SDR V⇄Iω/I∼=(I⊕QI)ω
using the projection p:V→(I⊕QI)ωand inclusion i: (I⊕QI)ω→Vfrom the decomposition (18);
kis equal to−(Q⃓⃓
I)−1:QI→I. Conversely, a symplectic SDR defines a non-degenerate isotrope
I:= Imk. Indeed, given k(v)∈Imk∩(Q(Imk))ω, for allv′∈V,
0 =ω(k(v),Qk(v′)) =ω(k(v),ip(v′))−ω(k(v),v′)−ω(k(v),kQ(v′)) =
=±ω(v,kip (v′))−ω(k(v),v′)±ω(v,k2Q(v′)) =ω(k(v),v′),
which forces k(v) = 0 and thus Im kis non-degenerate.
Similarly, an abstract Hodge decomposition is defined from a symplectic special deformation retract
by settings:=kandt:=ip, and given ( s,t), one can take I:= Ims.
It is then a straightforward check that these maps are well defined bijections. ■
223.4 Perturbative BV Integral
In this section, we recall the notion of perturbative BV integrals. Our goal is to define a formal
Laurent series ∫︂
L⊂VeSfree/ℏfρ∈R((ℏ))
whereL⊂Vis a Lagrangian and f⊗ρis a half-density on V. This integral is usually defined
choosing a Lagrangian complement to Land computing the ordinary Berezin-Lebesgue integral over
L [Sch93a]. Alternatively, one can define the perturbative version of this integral using homological
perturbation theory, see [ABF10; GJ12; Gwi13].
We choose a third approach and define this integral axiomatically, which quickly leads to explicit
formulas. This is possible for non-degenerate Sfree⃓⃓
L, essentially because we can use the canonical
decomposition from previous section. The axiomatic approach makes it easy to compare to other
approaches, see Remark 3.17 for a comparison with Berezin-Lebesgue integral and Section 3.4.3 for
an equivalence with homological perturbation theory.
Definition 3.16. Let (V,ω,S free) be a (−1)-shifted symplectic dg vector space and L⊂Va La-
grangian subspace such that the SL
freeis non-degenerate (Definition 3.12). Then
∫︂
L⊂VeSL

2.∫︂

2=
|L|1
2⊗|L|−1
2=R((ℏ)), where we use V∼=L⊕QL∼=L⊕L[1] and Lemma 3.3.
Remark 3.17. The first two items are motivated by usual properties of BV integrals: the integral of
∆-exact half-densities vanishes23and the integral only depends on the restriction of ftoL. The third
item fixes a normalization of the integral that matches the usual Gaussian integrals, see also [Sch93b,
Eq. (49)]. Indeed, for V=T∗[1]Rk,L=Rkandρ= 1for the canonical basis, we get
∫︂

22Our normalization of the integral implies that it has weight equal to sdim L= dimLeven−dimLodd
23This is the odd Stokes’s theorem of Schwarz [Sch93a, Thm. 2].
23Similarly, for V=T∗[1](Rk[1]⊕Rk[−1]),L=Rk[1]⊕Rk[−1]andρ= 1 for the canonical basis, we
get
∫︂

where the first two rows/columns in the matrix correspond to the fiber (even) coordinates and the last
two to base (odd) coordinates.
The first integral agress with the (even) Gaussian integral for sijnegative definite. The second
integral recovers the Berezin integral up to a sign.24
3.4.1 Properties of the BV Integral
To ensure that the integral from Definition 3.16 is uniquely defined, we will now show that (19) is
given by the famous Wick’s Lemma. To ensure that such integral exists, one needs to check that the
prescription given by Wick’s Lemma satisfies the properties listed in Definition 3.16. It is possible to
do so directly, but let us instead remark that (up to normalization), this integral can be constructed
using homological perturbation lemma, as explained below in Section 3.4.3.
To prove Wick’s Lemma, we will use a version of the Schwinger-Dyson equation, for context see
e.g. [HT20, Eq. 15.25].
Lemma 3.18 (Schwinger-Dyson equation) .Letβ∈Ann(L)⊂IL,f∈FV.
∫︂
L⊂VeSL
free/ℏ{Sfree,β}fρ=−(−1)|β|ℏ∫︂
L⊂VeSL

Proof. The axiom 1 of Definition 3.16 gives us
∫︂
L⊂VeSL
free/ℏ({Sfree,βf}+ℏ∆(βf))ρ= 0
which can be expanded using the properties of ∆and{−,−}. Three of the five terms vanish by axiom
2 and by the fact that ∆β= 0 sinceβis of polynomial degree 1. ■
Now we can relate integrals of homogeneous polynomials of degree k+1 with integrals of homogeneous
polynomials of degree k−1 using the non-degenerate pairing SL
free, arriving at Wick’s lemma.
Lemma 3.19 (Wick’s Lemma) .Let(V,ω,S free)be a (−1)-shifted symplectic dg vector space, L⊂V
Lagrangian such that SL
freeis non-degenerate. Choose a basis {γi}iofL∗. LetSL

where Pair(2k)is the set of (2k−1)!!partitions of the set {1,..., 2k}into disjoint pairs. The sign
(−1)σis obtained by bringing each variable γj1to the immediate left of its partner γj2assigned by the
pairingσ.
24To get correct signs for such Gaussian integrals, we would need to discuss orientations, which is orthogonal to the
goals of this work.
24The proof of this lemma is a standard calculation. Let us finish this section by proving a version of
Fubini’s theorem.
Proposition 3.20 (Fubini’s Theorem) .Fori= 1,2, let(Vi,Qi)be(−1)-shifted symplectic dg vector
spaces and let Li⊂Vibe non-degenerate Lagrangian subspaces. Then

Proof. It is easy to see that the LHS satisfies the three conditions from Definition 3.16.
1. The RHS is defined using the induced ( −1)-shifted symplectic structure {,},∆onV1×V2and
Sfree=S1

becomes

Here, the normalizations (2 π)...ℏ...match as the exponents are additive. ■
3.4.2 Fiber Integrals along Non-degenerate Reductions
Using the BV integral along a Lagrangian subspace (Definition 3.16) and the canonical decomposition
(18) of the source of a non-degenerate reduction from Proposition 3.13, we can now define (fiber)
integrals along reductions .
Remark 3.21. Using Lemma 3.5, we can motivate the following construction as follows, without any
non-canonical choices of decompositions of V. Let
f⊗ρ∈D1
2V=FV⊗|V|1
2=FV⊗|R|1
2⊗|I|
and decompose ρ=ρR⊗ρI∈|R|1
2⊗|I|. Now we can integrate f|C∈FCalongIto get a function
fR∈FR=F(C/I)using the translation-invariant measure ρI. We are left with fR⊗ρR∈D1
2R.
Definition 3.22. Let (V,ω,S free) be a (−1)-shifted symplectic dg vector space and L:V− → →Ra
non-degenerate reduction, denote Ker L=I. ConsiderV=Rcan⊕I⊕QIthe canonical decomposition
(18) from Proposition 3.13. We define

for the integral, while the second term induces a canonical transferred differential QRonR(see
also Appendix A.2).
Proposition 3.23. This integral satisfies the following three axioms.

Proof.
1. The odd Poisson bracket and the BV Laplacian split between the two symplectic subspaces
V=R⊕Rω, as follows from Proposition 2.13. By part 6 of Proposition 3.13, the only
non-zero components of the differential QareQ⃓⃓

({Sfree,−}+ℏ∆)⃓⃓

, and
we use Item 2 of Definition 3.16.

3.4.3 Fiber Integrals and Homological Perturbation Theory
We finish this section by showing that the axiomatic definition of the perturbative integral can be
easily connected to the homological perturbation lemma (see e.g. [Cra04]). This argument first ap-
peared in the Bc. thesis of O. Sk´ acel [Sk´ a17]; the connection of homological perturbation lemma and
perturbative BV integrals has appeared in e.g. [Alb; Cos11; Gwi13], see [DJP19, Section 5] for a
review.
Lemma 3.25 (Uniqueness of the projection in a SDR) .Let(i,p,k )be a SDR between (V,QV)and
(W,QW). Than any chain map p′:V→Wsatisfyingp′i= 1andp′k= 0is necessarily equal to p.
Proof. We post-compose ip= 1V+QVk+kQVwithp′to get
p′ip=p′+p′QVk+p′kQV
By the assumptions on p′, the LHS equals pwhile the last two terms on the RHS vanish. ■
Recall from Proposition 3.15 that a non-degenerate reduction L:V− → →Rdefines a symplectic SDR
betweenVandR. We extend it to a SDR ( I,P,K ) betweenFVandFR, cf. [DJP19, Sec. 3.3]. Finally,
we can see ℏ∆as a perturbation of {Sfree,−}, which allows us to use the homological perturbation
lemma to perturb the other maps to get a new SDR. Namely for P, the perturbed projection is equal
to
P′=P(1 +ℏ∆K+ (ℏ∆K)2+...).
Proposition 3.26 ([Sk´ a17, Sec. 3.2.3]) .LetL:V− → →Rbe a non-degenerate reduction. Then the
normalized fiber integral along Lis equal to the map P′, obtained by deformation of the SDR induced

4 Quantum (−1)-Symplectic Category
As explained by ˇSevera [Sev04], one should view Lagrangian submanifolds L⊂M of an odd symplectic
supermanifoldMas distributional half-densities on M. Indeed, the same way a half-density on M
gives a functional25on half-densities,
gλ↦→∫︂
Mfρgλ,
a Lagrangian Lalso gives a functional, a Dirac distribution supported on L;
gλ↦→∫︂
Lgλ≡∫︂
MδLgλ.
This leads to a natural enlargement of (the odd version of) Weinstein’s symplectic “category”: mor-
phismsM1→M 2between (−1)-symplectic supermanifolds should be (distributional) half-densities
onM1×M 2[Sev04, Def. 1], with composition given by integration over the common factor.
25Provided the integral convergences, e.g. the body of Mis compact.
27We now want to rigorously construct a linear version of such category. That is, we would like the
set of morphisms from VtoWto contain both half-densities on V×Wand Lagrangian subspaces of
V×W. If we try to compose these two kinds of morphisms together, we get a diagram
∗ V W.fρ∈D1
2VL⊂Lagr.V×W
It is natural to use the factorization of Lfrom Proposition 2.22 to take the integral along the reduction
V− → →RVto get∫︁
KerLfρ∈D1
2RV. Moreover, the isomorphism ϕ:RV→RW= ImL/(ImL)ωcan
be used to define
ϕ∗∫︂
KerL⊂Vfρ∈D1
2(ImL/(ImL)ω).
This leads us to the following definition of a distributional half-density on V.
Definition 4.1. Let (V,ω) be a (−1)-shifted symplectic vector space. A generalized Lagrangian
inVis a triple ( C,fρ,S free) where
•C⊆Vis a coisotropic subspace,
•fρ∈D1
2(C/Cω) is a half-density on the coisotropic reduction,
•Sfree∈Sym2((C/Cω)∗) is a solution of the classical master equation on the coisotropic reduction,
i.e. a differential on C/Cωcompatible with the symplectic form.
Given such generalized ( C,fρ,S free), we define a square-zero operator
ℏ∆(C,fρ,S free):= (C,ℏ∆(f)ρ+{Sfree,f}ρ,Sfree). ▲
Remark 4.2. Informally, such generalized Lagrangian should be seen as the “distributional half-
density”
eSfree/ℏfρ⊗δCω
onV, using a (non-canonical) decomposition V∼=(C/Cω)⊕T∗[1]Cω. This also motivates the defini-
tion of the action of ℏ∆on generalized Lagrangians, see also [Sev04, Thm. 3].
Generalized Lagrangians can be understood as “quantum” version of Lagrangian subspaces: Con-
sidering a half-density eSfree/ℏand taking ℏ→0limit, the path integral with weight eSfree/ℏlocalizes
to a Lagrangian subspace. For example, consider T∗[1]Rwith even and odd coordinate denoted by x
andξ. Then the distributional limit is
lim
ℏ=0ℏ−1/2e−1
2ax2/ℏ√︁
dxdξ =√︃
2π
aδx=0
(ignoring pairing with non-transversal δx=0). See also the work of Albert Schwarz [Sch93b, Sec. 7,
Lemmata 8, 8’].
We would like to define a category where morphisms V→Ware generalized Lagrangians in
V×W. To compose such morphisms, we need to investigate compositions of coisotropic relations in
more detail.
4.1 Coisotropic Relations
Acoisotropic relation fromV1toV2is a coisotropic subspace C⊆V1×V2, see e.g. [Wei88; Wei17].
Composition of coisotropic relations is defined by the usual composition of set-theoretic relations from
equation (5). Such composition is again coisotropic (see e.g. Remark 4.4 below), so we have a category
LinCoiso−1of coisotropic relations of ( −1)-symplectic vector spaces. It will be useful now to denote
the coisotropic reduction more concisely by
RC:=C/Cω.
Let us now define a reduction RC×RC′− → →RC′◦Cwhich will be used to define a composition of
generalized Lagrangian relations, see also Remark 4.4.
28Lemma 4.3. LetC⊆V1×V2andC′⊆V2×V3be two coisotropic relations. Then their R-
compositor , defined as the graded linear relation
RC×RC′ RC′◦C,XC,C′
XC,C′:={([v1,v2],[v2,v3],[v1,v3])∈RC×RC′×RC′◦C|(v1,v2)∈C,(v2,v3)∈C′}, (20)
is a reduction, i.e. a surjective Lagrangian relation. Furthermore, if C′′∈V3×V4is coisotropic, then
the following diagram in LinSymp−1commutes.
RC×RC′×RC′′ RC′◦C×RC′′
RC×RC′′◦C′ RC′′◦C′◦CXC,C′×diag(RC′′)
XC′◦C,C′′ diag(RC)×XC′,C′′
XC,C′′◦C′(21)
Proof. The relation XC,C′is Lagrangian since it can be obtained by coisotropic reduction along
C×C′×(C′◦C)⊂V1×V2×V2×V3×V1×V3
of the Lagrangian subspace
diag(V1×V2×V3),
using Lemma 2.9. It is surjective since for any ( v1,v3)∈C′◦C, one can (by definition) find v2such
that (v1,v2)∈Cand (v2,v3)∈C′.
Finally, both legs of the square (21) compose to relations RC×RC′×RC′′→RC′′◦C′◦Ccontaining
XC,C′,C′′:={([v1,v2],[v2,v3],[v3,v4],[v1,v4])|(v1,v2)∈C,(v2,v3)∈C′,(v3,v4)∈C′′}.
Since XC,C′,C′′is Lagrangian (by a similar argument as above), for dimensional reasons (Lemma 2.11)
the two legs of the square are necessarily equal to it. ■
Remark 4.4. The relation XC,C′can be more abstractly constructed as the composition of the fol-
lowing Lagrangian relations
V1×V2×V2×V3 V1×V3
RC×RC′ RC′◦CredV1×diag(V2)×V3
redT
C×C′ redC′◦C
XC,C′
The diagonal arrow has C′◦Cas its image, which proves that C′◦Cis coisotropic.
Note also that composition of relations V1L1−−→V2L2−−→V3is given by reduction26along the top line
of the diagram, while “composition” of half-densities on RCandRC′is given by “reduction” (fiber
integral) along the bottom line, see Definition 4.6.
Remark 4.5. TheR-compositor X•defined by equation (20) provides structure of a lax 2-functor on
R•:LinCoiso−1→BLinSymp−1,
where the 2-category of coisotropic relations LinCoiso−1has only identity 2-cells, while BLinSymp−1
is the one-object 2-category associated to the symmetric monoidal category (LinSymp−1,∗,×). This
appears to be a part of a higher categorical structure involving coisotropic reductions and half-densities,
which we will explore in future work.
26Denoted [L1×L2]Cin Lemma 2.9.
294.2 Quantum Linear (−1)-Shifted Symplectic Category
We are now ready to define a category where morphisms are given by generalized Lagrangian relations.
Since we can only compose morphisms if the appropriate perturbative integrals are well defined, we
only get a partial category , where composition is not always defined.
Definition 4.6. Thequantum linear (−1)-symplectic category LinQSymp−1is the partial cat-
egory where:
•Objects are finite-dimensional ( −1)-shifted symplectic vector spaces.
•Morphisms in LinQSymp−1(U,V) are generalized Lagrangians in U×V.
•The identity is given by the diagonal (diag( V)∈LinCoiso−1(V,V),1,0).
The composition of
V1 V2 V3(C,fρ,S free) (C′,f′ρ′,S′
free)
is defined if ( Sfree+S′
free) is non-degenerate27on Ker XC,C′, and is given by
(C′,f′ρ′,S′
free)◦(C,fρ,S free):=(︁
C′◦C,∫︂
XC,C′e(Sfree+S′
free)KerXC,C′/ℏfρ⊗f′ρ′,(Sfree+S′
free)RC◦C′)︁
.(22)
Here, XC,C′:RC×RC′− → →RC′◦Cis the R-compositor from Lemma 4.3. ▲
Proposition 4.7. The composition of LinQSymp−1is unital and associative. Moreover, for two
composable morphisms, we have
ℏ∆[(C′,f′ρ′,S′
free)◦(C,fρ,S free)]
=ℏ∆(C′,f′ρ′,S′
free)◦(C,fρ,S free) + (−1)|f′|(C′,f′ρ′,S′
free)◦ℏ∆(C,fρ,S free),
where the sum of two such generalized Lagrangians is defined by adding their half-density components.28
Proof. The composition (22) is defined by transferring along the reduction XC,C′. Composing C′◦C
withC′= diag(V2), we get XC,C′= diag( RC):RC→RC, which proves unitality.
When considering general ( C′′◦C′)◦CandC′′◦(C′◦C), the resulting composite reductions are
equal by diagram (21) of Lemma 4.3. Thus, associativity for the composed differential follows from
Appendix A.2, while associativity for the composed half-density follows from Lemma 3.24.
Finally, the compatibility of the composition with the operator ℏ∆follows immediately from Item
1 of Proposition 3.23. ■
4.2.1 Examples
Example 4.8. Each Lagrangian relation L:V→Wgives a generalized Lagrangian ( L,1,0), where
1∈D1
2(L/L) =R((ℏ)) should be thought of as a scalar multiplying δL(see Remark 4.2). This way,
we get LinSymp−1as a wide subcategory of LinQSymp−1, since one can easily verify that ( L′,1,0)◦
(L,1,0) = (L′◦L,1,0).
27In other words, if XC,C′is a non-degenerate reduction from(︂
RC×RC′,(Sfree+S′
free))︂
toRC′◦C.
28It is possible to define such addition of generalized Lagrangians, if they have the same coisotrope and differential.
This way, the category LinQSymp−1becomes enriched in the category of dg vector spaces, via the operator ℏ∆.
30Example 4.9. A composition
∗ V ∗(C,fρ,S free) (C′,f′ρ′,S′
free)
gives a formal Laurent series as a result (see Remark 3.10), i.e. defines a pairing of generalized La-
grangians in V. If we denote π,π′the projections to the coisotropic reductions of C,C′, then
KerXC,C′= Im XT
C,C′=π×π′(C∩C′).
For (Sfree+S′
free) non-degenerate on π×π′(C∩C′), this formal Laurent series is computed as
∫︂
π×π′(C∩C′)⊂RC×RC′e(Sfree+S′
free)/ℏfρ⊗f′ρ′∈R((ℏ)).
The operator ℏ∆is self-adjoint with respect to this pairing, due to Proposition 4.7.
Let us also highlight the following special cases, which show how the category LinQSymp−1contains
the standard BV integrals.
1. The case when both generalized Lagrangians come from Lagrangian subspaces was considered
in the previous examples.
2. If both generalized Lagrangians have support C=V, they are given by quadratic functions
Sfree,Sfree′∈Sym2V∗and half-densities fρ,f′ρ′∈D1
2V. Their composition is given by the
formal integral of the density eSfree+Sfree′ff′ρρ′overV.
3. If one of the generalized Lagrangians is of the form ( V,fρ,S free) and the other one is given by
(L,1,0) withL⊂VLagrangian, their pairing is given by the (formal) integral∫︁
LeSfreefρ.
We can generalize the last item above to transfer half-densities along Lagrangian relations.
Example 4.10. Let us now return to the motivating example above Definition 4.1. That is, we want
to compose
∗ U V.(U,fρ,S free) (L,1,0)
Let us consider the factorization cospan of L(Definition 2.25).
U V
RLUL
LV
Clearly,L◦U= ImL∈LinCoiso−1(∗,V). From the definition, it is easy to see that
XU,L={([0,u],[u,v],[0,v])|(u,v)∈L}⊂U×∗×R,
so Ker XU,L= KerLand Im XU,L=R. Therefore

314.3 Quantum L∞Algebras
Recall the definition of a quantum L∞algebra from [Zwi93], we will use the form [DJP19, Def. 7].
Definition 4.11. Aquantum L∞algebra structure on a (−1)-shifted symplectic space ( V,ω) is
defined by a sequence of elements
{Sg
n∈SymnV∗|n≥1,g≥0,2g+n≥2}
such that the formal sum
S=∑︂
n,gSg
nℏg∈FV
satisfies the quantum master equation
ℏ∆eS/ℏ= 0. ▲
Let us denote Sfree:=S0
2andSint=S−Sfree, interpreted as the free and the interaction parts of S
respectively. As a consequence of the quantum master equation, ( V,ω,S free) is a dg (−1)-symplectic
vector space, since {Sfree,Sfree}= 0. With the decomposition S=Sfree+Sint, the quantum master
equation can be equivalently written as
(Q+ℏ∆)eSint/ℏ= 0 or1
2{Sint,Sint}+ (Q+ℏ∆)Sint= 0, (23)
where we denote Q={Sfree,−}.
Proposition 4.12. LetS∈FVbe a quantum L∞algebra on a (−1)-symplectic vector space. Then
for any linear half-density ρ∈|V|1
2, the triple (V,eSint/ℏρ,Sfree)defines a ℏ∆-closed morphism
∗ V(V,eSint/ℏρ,Sfree)
in the category LinQSymp−1.
Proof. The fact that the morphism is ℏ∆-closed follows from the first form of the “decomposed”
quantum master equation in (23). ■
Thus, the same way as we could understand Lagrangian subspaces of Vas generalized points
L:∗ →VinLinSymp−1, quantum L∞algebras give additional generalized (dg) points of Vin
LinQSymp−1. Finally, we can now interpret the construction of the effective action29[DJP19] as a
composition in LinQSymp−1.
Proposition 4.13. LetSbe a quantum L∞algebra on Vand letVL− → →Rbe a non-degenerate
reduction with respect to Sfree. Then the composition (see Example 4.10)
∗ V R(V,eSint/ℏρ,Sfree) (L,1,0)(24)
is aℏ∆-closed generalized Lagrangian ∗→Rof the form (R,eW/ℏρR,SR
free)such thatSR
free+Wdefines
a quantum L∞algebra onR.
Example 4.14. In particular, the decomposition V∼=H⊕ImQ⊕Cin [DJP19, Lemma 4] auto-
matically gives a symplectic SDR (Proposition 3.15) and thus such choice induces a non-degenerate
reductionLH= diag(H)×C:V− → →H. Using Proposition 3.26 we get that the perturbed map P1
from [DJP19, Sec. 4.1.1] is equal (up to normalization) to the post-composition by the Lagrangian
relationLHinLinQSymp−1.
29See [DJP19, Sec. 5] for a review of other constructions of effective actions in [Cos11; Mne08; CL10; Bar13; BM18]
32Proof of Proposition 4.13. From Example 4.10, we know the composition is given by the perturbative
fiber integral of eSint/ℏρalong KerL. The compatibility of composition with ℏ∆from Proposition
4.7 implies that the resulting half-density is again ℏ∆-closed. The half-density component of the
composite (24) comes with a R((ℏ)) factor from Proposition 3.23 which can be absorbed into the
linear half-density ρRand the rest can be written as eW/ℏforW/ℏ∈FRofweight at least 1, since
the fiber integral is weight-homogeneous.
Thus, it remains to show that Whas only non-negative powers of ℏto conclude it defines a
quantumL∞algebra structure on R. As a consequence of Wick’s Lemma 3.19, we can use a standard
argument for Feynman graphs: the function eW/ℏis given by a sum over all graphs, and its logarithm
W/ℏis given by a sum over all connected graphs Γ, each weighted by ℏgenus(Γ)−1. ■
4.4 Relations of Quantum L∞Algebras
Finally, we can now use the category LinQSymp−1to discuss possible notions of morphisms between
quantumL∞algebras. Since we can encode a quantum L∞algebra on Vinto a morphism ∗→V, a
natural candidate for a morphism ( U,SU)→(V,SV) is a commutative triangle of the form:
∗
U V(U,eSU
int/ℏρU,SU
free) (V,eSV
int/ℏρV,SV
free)
(C,fρ,Q )
If (C,fρ,Q ) = (L,1,0) for a Lagrangian relation L:U→V, thenLhas to be surjective and we get
thatSVis the effective action computed by the fiber integral along L. We will now generalize this to
a Lagrangian relation Lwhere possibly Im L⊊V.
Definition 4.15. LetSU=SU
free+SU
intandSV=SV

We say a Lagrangian relation L:U→Vis arelation of quantum L∞algebras and write

2,ρV∈|V|1
2. The Lagrangian relations LU,LVare
the factorization cospan of Lfrom Definition 2.25, i.e. they are reductions such that L=LT
V◦LU.▲
Unraveling the definition, a relation of quantum L∞algebras satisfies the following:
1. The kernels Ker L= KerLU⊂Uand KerLT= KerLV⊂Vare non-degenerate isotropes.
2. The two differentials transferred along LUandLVtoRcoincide.

4.4.1 Composing Relations of Quantum L∞Algebras
It is natural to ask whether relations of quantum L∞algebras form a category; can they always be
composed? We formulate a sufficient condition: they are composable when the underlying factorization
cospans compose along pushouts as in Corollary 2.30.
Theorem 4.17. LetSUL1∼SVandSVL2∼SW. If moreover L1andL2compose orthogonally, then
SUL2◦L1∼SW.
Proof. We will prove that L2◦L1satisfies Definition 4.15. Consider the diagram from Theorem 2.30
given by factorization cospans of L1,L2and˜︁L◦LT. It commutes by the orthogonality assumption.
U V W
R ˜︁R
TLUL1
˜︁LL2
L
LW
K ˜︁K
⌟
Note that the factorization cospan of L2◦L1isK◦LU,˜︁K◦LW.
1. First, we prove non-degeneracy of K◦LU(the case of ˜︁K◦LWis completely analogous). Denote
KerLU=IU, KerL=I, Ker˜︁L=˜︁I, Ker(K◦LU) =J. Letu∈J∩(QUJ)ωU, we need to prove
that thenu= 0. It is enough to prove that u∈IU, since the case of u∈IU∩(QUJ)ωis trivial.
The idea is to “transport” the property u∈(QUJ)ωtoVusingu∈J= Ker(L2◦L1), where it
becomesv∈˜︁I∩(QV˜︁I)ωfor somev∈Vsuch thatu∼L1v. Non-degeneracy of ˜︁Iimplies that
v= 0, thusu∼L10, i.e.u∈IU. For details, see the proof of Lemma A.3 of Appendix A.3.
2. Thanks to non-degeneracy condition verified above, the transfer of QUandQWtoTare well-
defined. By the assumptions SU
freeL1∼SV
freeandSV
freeL2∼SW
free, the differentials can equivalently be
transferred from ValongK◦Land˜︁K◦˜︁L. But by the orthogonality condition and Corollary 2.30,
˜︁K◦˜︁L=K◦Land the transferred differentials coincide.
3. By the above arguments, the perturbative BV integrals along K◦LUand˜︁K◦LWare well-
defined. Using Lemma 3.24, SUL1∼SV, andSVL2∼SW, we can repeat the argument from the
previous step and conclude the integrals also coincide. ■
34Remark 4.18. Instead of our definition of a relation of quantum L∞algebras (see Remark 4.16) we
may consider a span in ∗/LinQSymp−1of the form
∗
W
V ˜︁V(L,1,0) (˜︁L,1,0)(V,eSV
int/ℏρV,SV
free)
(W,eSW
int/ℏρW,SW
free)(˜︁V,eS˜︁V
int/ℏρ˜︁V,S˜︁V
free)
to be a morphism between SV=SV
free+SV
intandS˜︁V=S˜︁V
free+S˜︁V
int. If we require the span of reductions
(L,˜︁L)to be orthogonal, by Theorem 4.17 (taking L1=LT,L2=˜︁L) we also have
S˜︁L◦LT
∼˜︁S.
So orthogonal spans in ∗/LinQSymp−1are special cases of relations of quantum L∞algebras. The
opposite problem—associating an orthogonal span of relations of quantum L∞algebras to a relation
(i.e. cospan) of quantum L∞algebras—is much more difficult and it appears it poses the need for
(formal) non-linear generalization of the linear quantum (−1)-symplectic category. We will explore
this problem in future work.
A Appendix
A.1 Inductive Construction of a Complement to a Coisotrope
Let us prove a lemma used to construct decompositions of Vin Section 2.1.1.
Lemma A.1. LetC⊆Vbe a coisotropic subspace. Denote I:=Cω⊆Cits symplectic complement,
which is isotropic. Then, for every n∈{0,1,...}there exists an isotropic complement
B(n)=Bn⊕B1−n⊂Vn⊕V1−n
ofCn⊕C1−nsatisfying
dimBn= dimI1−n,
dimB1−n= dimIn.
In other words, the Z-graded vector space30B:=⨁︁
k≥0B(n)⊂Vis an isotropic complement of Csat-
isfying
s−1DI(s) = DB(s−1)or equivalently s−1DB(s) = DI(s−1).
Proof. To simplify the notation, let us fix n≥0 and drop the superscript ( n) inB(n). We will work
by induction on dim Bn+dimB1−n. The induction hypothesis will be that there is a graded subspace
B⊆Vsuch that
•Bis isotropic,
•B∩C= 0,
30For infinite-dimensional V/C, this requires the axiom of countable choice.
35•dimBk= 0 for allk /∈{n,1−n},
•dimBk≤dimI1−kfor allk∈{n,1−n}.
The induction starts with B={0}. In each step, if dim Bk<dimI1−kfor somek∈{n,1−n}, we
will choose an element b∈(Bω\(B⊕C))kand change BtoB′=⟨B,b⟩. This new B′again satisfies
the four properties above; once we reach dim Bk= dimI1−kfor allk∈{n,1−n}, the induction stops.
To show that such bexists, we will show that
dim (Bω)k−dim (Bω∩(B⊕C))k= dimI1−k−dimBk, (25)
and, provided dim Bk<dimI1−k, we can find a suitable b.
To prove (25), we will use the fact that Bω∩(B⊕C) = (Bω∩C)⊕Band by Lemma 2.12, the
symplectic complement is an involution, so Bω∩C= (B+I)ω= (B⊕I)ωand
DBω(s)−DBω∩(B⊕C)(s) = DBω(s)−D(B⊕I)ω(s)−DB(s).
Now we use Lemma 2.11, which says that D Wω(s) =sDV(s−1)−sDW(s−1). Four terms cancel out
and we are left with
DBω(s)−DBω∩(B⊕C)(s) =sDI(s−1)−DB(s).
The coefficient at skof this equation is exactly (25). ■
A.2 Transporting Differentials Along Reductions
Proposition A.2. LetC⊂Vbe a coisotropic subspace and let Qbe a differential on Vsuch that
L:V→Ris a non-degenerate reduction (Definition 3.12). Define a relation QR:R[1]→Rby as
the composition of the following relations
R[1]V[1]VR.LT GrQL
ThenQRis the graph of a degree 1 differential on Rand agrees with the map
RVVRinclRQ projR
given by the canonical decomposition (18).
Proof. The relation QRconsists of pairs{([c],[Qc])∈R[1]×R|c∈Csuch thatQc∈C}. We will
first show it is coinjective and cosurjective.
•Elements of Ker( QR)Tare of the form [ Qi] fori∈I= KerLsuch thatQi∈C=Iω. This is
equivalent to ω(Qi,−)I= 0, i.e.SI
free(i,−) = 0, which implies i= 0 and thus Ker( QR)T= 0.
•To show Im( QR)T=R, we want to show that each r∈Rhas a representative c∈Csuch
Qc∈C. Let us choose any representative c0∈Cofr. We are looking for i0∈Isuch that
Q(c0+i0)∈C=Iω, i.e. fori0solving
ω(−Qc0,−)I=ω(Qi0,−)I=SI
free(i0,−)
which is possible as SI
freeis non-degenerate.
To check that the induced map squares to 0, the composition of relations QR◦QRis given by
[c]∼c∼Qc∼[Qc]∼Qc+i∼Q2c+Qi∼[Qi]
but this is independent of the choice of i(such thatQi∈C), i.e. we can take i= 0.
Finally, using the decomposition V=I⊕R⊕QI, we get that the relation QRcontains a pair
(r,Qr ) coming from r∼(0,r,0)∼(0,Qr, 0)∼Qr. ■
36A.3 Composition and Non-Degeneracy
Consider the diagram from Theorem 2.30 given by factorization cospans of Lagrangian relations L1,L2
and˜︁L◦LT. It commutes if and only if we assume L1andL2compose orthogonally, i.e. Ker L⊥Ker˜︁L.
U V W
R ˜︁R
TLUL1
˜︁LL2
L
LW
K ˜︁K
⌟
Lemma A.3. LetL1:U→V,L 2:V→Wbe Lagrangian relations between (−1)-shifted dg symplectic
vector spaces U,V,W (Definition 3.11) such that
1. the kernels IU= KerL1,I= KerLT
1,˜︁I= KerL2are non-degenerate isotropes (Definition 3.12),
2.SU
freeL1∼SV
freeandSV
freeL2∼SW
free(Definition 4.15),
3.L1andL2compose orthogonally (Definition 2.26).
Then also the kernel of L2◦L1is a non-degenerate isotrope J= Ker(L2◦L1).
Proof. Letu∈J∩(QUJ)ωU, we will prove that then u= 0. It is enough to prove that u∈IU, since
by non-degeneracy of IUandIU⊆J,
IU∩(QUJ)ωU⊆IU∩(QUIU)ωU={0}.
Proof that u∈IU.FromIU⊆J⊆JωU⊆IωU
U=IU⊕RU
can, we have the decomposition u=u0+uR
foru0∈IU,uR∈RU
can∩J. Byu∈(QUJ)ωU, for allu′∈J,
ωU(u,QU(u′)) = 0.
Decomposing u′=u′
0+u′
R∈IU⊕(RU
can∩J), we have
ωU(u,QU(u′
0)) +ωU(u0,QU(u′
R)) +ωU(uR,QU(u′
R)) = 0,
where the first term vanishes since u∈(QUIU)ωUand the second vanishes since QU(RU
can)⊆RU
can
andRU
can⊥IU. We are thus left with the last term and using the fact that the projection πU:U→R
restricts to a symplectic isomorphism πU:RU
can∼=R,
ωR(πU(uR),πU◦QU(u′
R)) = 0.
We will now prove that ( uR,0)∈L1, i.e.uR∈KerL1=IU, which implies that also u∈IU. With
this, the proof of non-degeneracy will be complete.
Proof that uR∈IU.ByuR,u′
R∈J, there exist v,v′∈Vsuch that ( uR,v),(u′
R,v′)∈L1and
v,v′∈KerL2=˜︁I. Using this, πU◦QU=QU
R◦πU, andSU
freeL1∼SV
free, we obtain
ωR(πU(uR),QU
R◦πU(u′
R)) =ωR(π(v),QV
R◦π(v′)) = 0.
Sincev′is in the image of an arbitrary u′
R∈J∩RU
can, the last equality holds for any
v′∈L1(J∩RU
can) =L1(J) = ImL1∩KerL2=IωV∩˜︁I.
By orthogonality, IωV∩˜︁I=˜︁I, so we have
ωR(π(v),QV
R◦π(v′)) = 0 for any v′∈˜︁I. (26)
37Without loss of generality, we consider a representant v∈˜︁I∩RI
can, whereRI
can= (I⊕QVI)ωV. Then
we have for any v′=v′
0+v′
R∈˜︁Iwithv′
0∈I,v′
R∈RI
can,
ωV(v,QV(v′)) =ωV(v,QV(v′
0)) +ωV(v,QV(v′
R)) = 0.
The first term vanishes as RI
can⊥QVI, the second one contains only entries in RI
can, so it can be
rewritten as ωR(π(v),π◦QV(v′
R)) =ωR(π(v),QV
R◦π(v′
R)) =ωR(π(v),QV
R◦π(v′)) and it vanishes by
equation (26). We have proven that v∈˜︁I∩(QV˜︁I)ωVand by the non-degeneracy of ˜︁I, we obtain v= 0
and thusuR∈IU.
