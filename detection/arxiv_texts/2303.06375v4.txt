Abstract: In this work we present a rigorous and straightforward method to detect the onset of the
instability of replica-symmetric theories in information processing systems, which does not require a
full replica analysis as in the method originally proposed by de Almeida and Thouless for spin glasses.
The method is based on an expansion of the free-energy obtained within one-step of replica symmetry
breaking (RSB) around the RS value. As such, it requires solely continuity and differentiability of
the free-energy and it is robust to be applied broadly to systems with quenched disorder. We apply
the method to the Hopfield model and to neural networks with multi-node Hebbian interactions, as
case studies. In the appendices we test the method on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and the Ising
P-spin models, recovering the AT lines known in the literature for these models, as a special limit,
which corresponds to assuming that the transition from the RS to the RSB phase can be obtained by
varying continuously the order parameters. Our method provides a generalization of the AT approach,
which does not rely on this limit and can be applied to systems with discontinuous phase transitions,
as we show explicitly for the spherical P-spin model, recovering the known RS instability line.arXiv:2303.06375v4  [cond-mat.dis-nn]  12 Nov 2023Contents

1 Introduction
Replica symmetry breaking in neural networks has attracted increasing attention in recent years
[4, 12, 13, 31, 43], however there is, as yet, no general broken replica-symmetry theory for these
systems and no simple method to systematically detect their transition from the replica-symmetric
(RS) to the replica-symmetry-broken (RSB) phase.
While the first point is still out of reach, the second question can be addressed by adapting approaches
originally developed for spin glasses. Indeed, the instability line of the RS phase in the Sherrington-
Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model was derived by de Almeida and Thouless (AT) many decades ago
[25], using a method based on replicas. Since their seminal work, rigorous techniques have been
developed and tested in archetypical mean-field as well as short-ranged spin glass models, by many
researchers (see e.g. [14, 17, 18, 30, 32, 34, 38, 39]).
As neural networks are particular realizations of spin glasses, it is quite natural to ask if we can devise
a systematic method to derive the RS instability line also for these systems. In this work we answer
affirmatively to this question, using the Hopfield model of neural networks and a model of dense
associative memory, which extends Hebbian learning to multi-node interactions, as case studies. To
this purpose, we devise a method inspired by the approach proposed by Toninelli in [41], which builds
on Guerra’s work on broken replica-symmetry bounds [29]. As a technical note we remark that at
difference with conventional spin glasses, here we focus on the RS instability in the parameter space
(α, T) where αis the storage load of the network and Tis the noise level, rather than in the space
(h, T) (i.e. magnetic field, temperature) conventionally used in spin glasses.
– 1 –For the Hopfield model, our method recovers the instability line obtained by Coolen [19] using the
AT approach, as a special limit, which corresponds to assuming a continuous transition from the RS
to the RSB phase, in the order parameters. Therefore, our method provides a generalization of the
AT approach, which can be applied to systems with a discontinuous transition from the RS to the
1RSB phase. Another advantage of our method, when compared to the involved calculations of the
AT method in the Hopfield model [19], is its remarkable simplicity. This allows for straightforward
application to more complex neural network models, such as dense associative memories with P-node
interactions. We supplement the results in the main text with appendix A where we show our method
at work on conventional spin-glass models, namely the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, the Ising P-
spin and the spherical P-spin model, the latter providing an example of system which exhibits a
discontinuous phase transition from the RS to the RSB phase. In all cases, we retrieve the AT lines
known for these models [19, 24, 25, 27] in a specific limit, confirming the validity of our approach
as a generalization of the AT method. As expected from the decomposition theorem of multi-node
Hebbian networks proved in [4], for dense associative memories with P-node interactions we retrieve
the instability line of the Ising P-spin model derived in Appendix A. Appendices B and C provide
further technical details.
2 The Hopfield model
In this section we illustrate the method for the Hopfield model with NIsing neurons σi∈ {1,−1}, i=
1, . . . , N andK=αNstored patterns ξµ,µ= 1, . . . , K . Each pattern ξµis a sequence of N
Rademacher entries (i.e. Bernoulli variables) ξµ
i,i= 1, . . . , N , with distribution
P(ξµ
i) =1

The Hamiltonian of the model is
HN(σ|ξ) =−1
NN,NX
i,j=1,1KX
µ=1ξµ
iξµ
jσiσj (2.2)
and we denote the associated Boltzmann factor, at inverse temperature β= 1/T, as
BN(σ|ξ) =e−βHN(σ|ξ)
Z, Z =X
σe−βHN(σ|ξ). (2.3)
In the so-called ‘retrieval’ phase, the equilibrium local configurations are correlated only with a single
pattern, say ν. As the couplings Jij=PK
µ=1ξµ
iξµ
jare symmetric w.r.t. permutations of the patterns,
it is assumed without loss of generality that ν= 1. It is then convenient to define as the order
parameters of the system, the so-called Mattis magnetization
m(σ) :=1
NNX
i=1ξ1

which quantifies the alignment of the system configuration σwith the retrieval pattern ξ1, and the
two-replica overlap

The RS analysis assumes that the order parameters mandqself-average around their equilibrium
values ¯ mand ¯q, in the thermodynamic limit, namely
lim
N→+∞PN(m) =δ(m−¯m), (2.6)

der). Under this assumption, the free-energy, averaged over the pattern distribution, f, is given by
(see [5])

where zis a random Gaussian variable with zero average and unit variance, Edenotes the average

the celebrated Amit-Gutfreund-Sompolinsky self-consistency equations [5, 20]:

On the other hand, within one step of the replica-symmetry breaking (1RSB) scheme [1, 21, 37] it is
assumed that the distribution of the two-replica overlap q, in the thermodynamic limit, displays two
delta-peaks at the equilibrium values ¯ q0and ¯q1>¯q0and the concentration on these two values is ruled
by the parameter θ∈[0,1], while mself-averages as in the RS case :

lim
N→+∞P′
N(q) =θδ(q−¯q0) + (1 −θ)δ(q−¯q1), (2.12)
Within this assumption, the disorder-averaged free-energy is given by (see e.g. [1])

and we have denoted with E1,E2the averages w.r.t. the standard normal variables z(1)andz(2),
respectively. From now on, we imply the dependence of all the functions on βandα. By extremizing
the 1RSB free-energy w.r.t. its order parameters ¯ q0,¯q1,¯m1, it is possible to show that the latter
fulfill the following self-consistency equations
¯m1=E1"

The key idea of our method is to assume that at the onset of the RS instability, one of the two delta-
peaks in equation (2.12) has vanishing weight, i.e. either θ→0 orθ→1. Consistency with the RS
theory then requires the dominating peak to be located at the value ¯ qof the RS order parameter,
so either lim θ→0¯q1= ¯qor lim θ→1¯q0= ¯q. As we will see below, both these relations are generally
satisfied, hence we appeal to the physical interpretation of RS breaking to determine which scenario
applies. Noting that when the RS theory becomes unstable, a multiplicity of states emerges with
mutual overlap ¯ q0and self-overlap ¯ q1, within the single state (or each of the states) predicted by the
RS theory, it is natural to assume that the value of the mutual overlap between the newly born states
is equal to the self-overlap ¯ qof the state(s) assumed by the RS theory. Thus, we will assume that
at the onset of the RS instability, ¯ q0→¯q, hence θ→1. For the Hopfield model, taking this limit in
(2.17), and using
g1( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0) =β¯m1+βz(1)√α¯q0

coshAcoshB+sinh BsinhA(Adenoting the first two terms on the RHS of (2.18) and Bthe last one)
and have performed the integral over z(2)using the oddity of the sinh function. As (2.19) is identical
to (2.9), in the limit θ→1, ¯q0is indeed equal to the RS order parameter ¯ q, as anticipated. Similarly,
we can show that
lim
θ→1¯m1= ¯m (2.20)
and one can easily verify that f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)|θ=1=fRS( ¯m,¯q), as expected from the fact that, for
θ= 1, Eq. (2.12) reduces to (2.7) and one retrieves the RS scheme. Our purpose is then to prove that
for values of θclose but away from one, the 1RSB expression of the quenched free-energy is smaller
than the RS expression, i.e. f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)< fRS( ¯m,¯q), below a critical line in the parameters
space ( α, β).
To this purpose, we expand the 1RSB quenched free-energy around θ= 1 (i.e. around the replica
symmetric expression) to the first order, writing
f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ) =f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)|θ=1+ (θ−1)∂θf1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)|θ=1, (2.21)
where f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)|θ=1=fRS( ¯m,¯q). To determine when the RS solution becomes unstable,
i.e.f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)< fRS( ¯m,¯q) we inspect the sign of ∂θf1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)|θ=1, keeping in mind
that θ−1<0. To evaluate the latter, we need to expand the self-consistency equations for ¯ m1,¯q0
and ¯q1around θ= 1, to linear orders in θ−1. We obtain

where A( ¯m1,¯q0,¯q1) is a function of ¯ m1, ¯q0and ¯q1that will drop out of the calculation, whose expression
is provided in (C.1). As to O((θ−1)0), ¯q0and ¯m1are equal to the RS order parameters ¯ qand ¯m,
respectively, we can rewrite (2.22) as
¯q0= ¯q+ (θ−1)A( ¯m,¯q,¯q1). (2.23)
Following the same path for ¯ q1, and using (2.23), we have
¯q1=:E1E2coshg1( ¯m,¯q1,¯q) tanh2g1( ¯m,¯q1,¯q)

where B( ¯m1,¯q0,¯q1) is provided in (C.2) and will drop out of the calculation. For θ= 1, we have
¯q1=E1E2coshg1( ¯m,¯q1,¯q) tanh2g1( ¯m,¯q1,¯q)
E2coshg1( ¯m,¯q1,¯q)
(2.25)
which is a self-consistency equation for ¯ q1, that depends only on ¯ qand ¯m. Denoting with ˜ q1( ¯m,¯q) its
solution, we can then write (2.24) as
¯q1= ˜q1( ¯m,¯q) + (θ−1)B( ¯m,¯q,˜q1( ¯m,¯q)) (2.26)
and, finally,
¯q0= ¯q+ (θ−1)A( ¯m,¯q,˜q1( ¯m,¯q)). (2.27)
– 5 –Similarly to ¯ q0and ¯q1we can expand also ¯ m1as
¯m1= ¯m+ (θ−1)C( ¯m,¯q,˜q1( ¯m,¯q)) (2.28)
where C( ¯m,¯q,˜q1( ¯m,¯q)) is provided in (C.3).
Using (2.28), (2.26) and (2.27) to evaluate the derivative of f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ) w.r.t. θand finally
setting θ= 1, we obtain:

Next, we study the sign of (2.29), where ¯ qand ˜q1( ¯m,¯q) are the solutions of the self-consistency
equations (2.9) and (2.25), respectively. To this purpose, it is useful to study the behaviour of the
function K( ¯m,¯q, x) forx∈[0,¯q]. For x= ¯q, regardless of the value assigned to ¯ m, we have K( ¯m,¯q,¯q) =
0, while the extremum of K( ¯m,¯q, x) is found from

where the last equality follows from Eq. (2.25). Given that K( ¯m,¯q, x) vanishes for x= ¯q, if the
extremum x= ˜q1( ¯m,¯q) is global in the domain considered, we must have that K(¯q,˜q1(¯q))>0 if
x= ˜q1(¯q) is a maximum and K( ¯m,¯q,˜q1(¯q))<0 ifx= ˜q1( ¯m,¯q) is a minimum. Therefore, if

the scaled parameter T/√α, for different values of α(as shown in the legend), for the Hopfield model
(left) and Hebbian networks with P-node interactions, for P= 4 (mid) and P= 6 (right).
While this limit is a priori unjustified, as ¯ qand ˜q1( ¯m,¯q) should be solved from the self-consistency
equations (2.9) and (2.25), respectively, one can check numerically that the solutions of these equations
are virtually indistinguishable for any temperature (see Fig. 1, left panel), and the resulting RS
instability line is almost identical to the AT line derived in [19], see Fig. 2 (left panel). Small
deviations can be appreciated in the retrieval region (see right panel), but these are likely due to
numerical precision.
As our method does not rely on the assumption ˜ q1( ¯m,¯q)→¯q, it provides a more general approach
than the one originally devised by de Almeida and Thouless, that can be carried over to systems
with discontinuous phase transitions, where ¯ q1differs from ¯ q0even at the onset of the RS instability,
implying ˜ q1( ¯m,¯q)̸= ¯q.
Before concluding this section, we note that, although we have disregarded the limit θ→0 as lacking
physical interpretation, such limit is still well defined mathematically and one may ask what would be
the outcome of a similar analysis carried out in this limit. We will perform such analysis in Appendix
B. Intriguingly, we find that the analysis for θ→0 gives the same instability line as the analysis for
θ→1, in all the models we considered, except in the spherical P-spin model. Reassuringly, in the
latter case, the analysis at θ→0 leads to a lower temperature for the RS instability, confirming that
the limit θ→1 gives the physical transition and it is therefore the relevant one.
3 Hebbian networks with P-node interactions
In this section we consider generalizations of the Hopfield model, where neurons interact in P-tuples of
even P≥4 (rather than pairwise, i.e. P= 2). Such networks were shown to store many more patterns

line obtained in the limit ˜ q1( ¯m,¯q)→¯q(red dashed curve), for the Hopfield model model. The several
branches separate the paramagnetic (P), spin-glass (SG) and retrieval (M) region. The black curve
show the critical temperature T⋆at which ¯ qbecomes non-zero within the RS theory, i.e. the spin-glass
(SG) transition.
than the number of their nodes, so they work as dense associative memories [33]. They are also known
to be dual to deep neural networks [3, 4] and to exhibit information processing capabilities that are
forbidden in shallow networks, such as the existence of a region in the parameter space where they can
retrieve patterns although these are overshadowed by the noise [2]. As before, we consider a network

In this approximation the self-consistency equations for the order parameter ¯ q1, ¯q0and ¯mare as in
(2.17), with the argument of the hyperbolic cosine and tangent replaced by (3.5). As before, for θ= 1,
¯q0= ¯qand the 1RSB expression for the quenched free-energy reduces to the RS one.
From now on, we imply the dependence of the functions on β′andα. Our objective is to prove that
forθclose but away from one, the 1RSB quenched free-energy is smaller than its replica symmetric
counterpart i.e. f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)< fRS( ¯m,¯q) above a critical value of the effective parameter√αβ′.
To this purpose, we proceed as in the Hopfield model: we expand, to the leading order in θ−1, the
1RSB quenched free-energy around its RS expression, as shown in (2.21). Since the self-consistency
equations also depend on θ, we need to expand them too. Following the same steps as in the Hopfield
model, we can write ¯ m1as in (2.28) with C( ¯m,¯q,˜q1( ¯m,¯q)) as in (C.9), where ˜ q1( ¯m,¯q) is the solution
of the self-consistency equation

given in (C.8). With the above expressions in hand, we can now calculate the derivative of f1RSB
w.r.t. θwhen θ= 1, as needed in (2.21)

Again, we have that K( ¯m,¯q,¯q) = 0, regardless of the value assigned to ¯ m, (this follows from the fact
that for θ= 1, ¯ qis an extremum of the free-energy). Next, we inspect the sign of K( ¯m,˜q1( ¯m,¯q),¯q).
To this purpose, we study K( ¯m,¯q, x) for x∈[0,¯q] and locate its extrema, which are found from

As noted in [4, 15], Hebbian networks with P-node interactions are equivalent to Ising P-spin models
under a suitable rescaling of the temperature β′√α→β′. With this rescaling, (3.11) retrieves indeed
the RS instability line of the Ising P-spin model, that we have for completeness derived in Appendix
A, using our method (see eq. (A.30)). In the limit ˜ q1( ¯m,¯q)→¯q, (A.30) retrieves the AT line of the
Ising P-spin model [27]. In Fig. 1 (mid and right panels) we plot the difference between ˜ q1( ¯m,¯q) and
¯qfor Hebbian networks with P-node interactions (obtained solving numerically the self-consistency
equations (3.6) and (3.3)) as a function of the scaled parameter T/√α, for different values of α. As
for the Hopfield model, we find that ˜ q1( ¯m,¯q) is indistinguishable from ¯ q, hence the limit ˜ q1( ¯m,¯q)→¯q
can be justified a posteriori .
Figure 3 : RS instability line (i.e. Tcversus α) obtained via our method, i.e. by expanding the
free-energy around θ= 1 (blue dots) and the AT line obtained in the limit ˜ q1( ¯m,¯q)→¯q(red curve),
for the Hebbian network with P-node interactions, with P= 2,4,6 from left to right. The black
curves show the critical temperature T⋆at which ¯ qbecomes non-zero within the RS theory, i.e. the
spin-glass (SG) transition.
In Fig. 3 we show the RS instability lines resulting from our method and the classic AT line obtained
in the limit ˜ q1( ¯m,¯q)→¯q, for different values of P. The two lines coincides for all values of P. As
– 10 –explained earlier, we could have expanded the free-energy around θ= 0 (as opposed to θ= 1). In
Appendix B we show that such analysis leads to the same line.
4 Discussion
In this work we proposed a simple and systematic method to derive the critical line in the parameter
space ( α, β), below which the 1RSB expression for the free-energy is smaller than the RS expression,
in Hebbian neural networks. The same analysis for spin-glass models is carried out in appendix A.
For the Hopfield model, our approach recovers the critical line obtained by Coolen using the AT
approach [19] as a special limit. Similarly, we recover the known AT lines of all the spin-glass models
considered in the appendix, in the same limit, showing that our method provides a generalization of
the approach originally devised by de Almeida and Thouless. Owing to its simplicity, our method
allows for straightforward application to Hebbian networks with multi-node interactions, for which
the AT-line was unknown.
The key idea of our method is to regard the 1RSB theory, which assumes two delta-peaks in the overlap
distribution P(q), located at ¯ q1and ¯q0<¯q1, with weights 1 −θandθ, respectively, as departing
continuously from the RS theory, which assumes only one peak at ¯ q. This leads us to assume that
at the onset of the RS instability, the 1RSB overlap distribution is dominated by one peak, so that
either θ→0 or θ→1. Then, consistency with the RS theory requires either lim θ→0¯q1= ¯qor
limθ→1¯q0= ¯q. As the physical interpretation of RS breaking suggests that the mutual overlap between
1RSB states should be equal to the self-overlap of the RS states, we regard the 1RSB theory as a
continuous variation of the RS theory, when the parameter θis decreased from one. Crucially, we do
not make any assumption on the location of the peaks of the 1RSB theory, which are fixed by the
1RSB self-consistency equations. We then compare the 1RSB and the RS free-energies when θ(the
only free-parameter in our analysis) is close to one, by performing simple expansions to linear orders
inθ−1. In doing so, we solely require that f1RSB,¯q1,¯q0and ¯m1are differentiable up to the first order
in a neighborhood of θ=1 and that the derivative of f1RSB exists at θ= 1.
Although our method is similar in spirit to the one introduced by Toninelli in [41], there is a crucial
difference, in that the latter relies on the assumption ¯ q1→¯q, which is, in our view, unjustified a priori.
In fact, while ¯ q0= ¯qforθ= 1, ¯ q1may differ from ¯ q, even in the limit θ→1. This consideration also
leads to a departure of our approach from the method originally devised by de Almeida and Thouless,
which relies on a variation of the RS free-energy as the order parameters are varied continuously around
their RS values. In contrast, we study the variation of the RS free-energy as the statistical weight of
the order parameters is varied continuously (rather than the actual value of the order parameters).
This approach allows us to determine the instability line of the RS theory also in spin-glass models
which exhibit a discontinuous phase transition. As a prototypical example of this class of models, we
consider in Appendix A the spherical P-spin model [21].
In conclusion, in this work we have presented a new method to find the instability line of the RS
approximation. A compelling advantage of our method, when compared to the approach by de Almeida
and Thouless [25], is that it does not require to compute the full eigenspectrum of the Hessian of the
quadratic fluctuations of the free-energy around its RS value and it does not rely on the availability
of an “ansatz-free” expression for the free-energy. This makes the computations easier and affordable
also for neural networks. The method still requires the availability of explicit expressions for the RS
and 1RSB free-energies, which however can be computed using different techniques (e.g. Guerra’s
interpolation) in addition to the replica trick. Our approach can in principle be extended to compute
the stability of the k-RSB solution, expanding the corresponding k+ 1-RSB free-energy, provided
– 11 –one has an explicit expression for the two. For example, it would be interesting to see whether the
well-known transition from 1RSB to full-RSB occurring at the Gardner temperature [27] in the Ising
P-spin model can be recovered within our approach, by studying the stability of the 2RSB solution.
In addition, in recent years there has been a boost of renewed interest in mixed P-spherical models,
as introduced in [6, 22], as they have been shown to display unexpected dynamical behaviour [26]
and new types of spin-glass phases [23], [42] as well as for their relevance to the modelling of random
lasers [7–11]. These models similarly display transitions from 1RSB to full-RSB and would be good
lab systems to test extensions of our theory. Another interesting avenue for future work would be
a generalization of the 1-RSB scheme, which does not assume the Mattis magnetization to be self-
averaging. Preliminary work in [1] suggests that the RS assumption is not the right approximation
for Mattis magnetization.
Finally, an attractive perspective would be to apply our approach to predict the onset of ergodicity
breaking in systems with sparse interactions. In such systems, the free-energy is typically expressed, al-
ready at the simplest RS level, in terms of order-parameter functions to be determined self-consistently.
At 1RSB level, recursive equations for functional distributions of such functions must be solved. Work-
ing out the fluctuations of ansatz-free free-energies around their RS value, as it would be required by
the de Almeida and Thouless approach would be unfeasible and no similar approach has been proposed
to date. An alternative approach has been devised in [40], for the Bethe lattice with regular degrees,
however it strongly relies on the assumptions of homogeneity in the network nodes and large degrees.
We envisage that, owing to its simplicity, our method may carry over to more general sparse systems,
where it would require an expansion of the functional 1RSB self-consistency equation to linear orders
around the RS equation, which should be feasible.

– 14 –A Applications to Spin-glasses models
In this appendix, we derive the critical line for the instability of the RS theory for three archetypical
spin-glass models, namely the SK model, the Ising P-spin and the spherical P-spin model, using the
technique developed in the main text. In all cases, we will recover the AT lines known in the literature
for the three models, in a specific limit, confirming the validity and higher generality of our approach.
A.1 Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model
The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model [36] is a system of NIsing spins σi∈ {± 1}interacting via
symmetric pairwise interactions Jijwhich are i.i.d. Gaussian variables with zero average and variance
J2/N. The Hamiltonian of the model is
HN(σ|J) :=−1

and the order parameter is the two-replica overlap qas defined in (2.4). The quenched free-energy in

andE1,E2are the average w.r.t. the standard Gaussian variables z(1)andz(2), respectively. From
now on, we imply the dependence of g,fRSandf1RSB onβandJ. The order parameters ¯ q0and ¯q1
fulfill the following self-consistency equations

Noting that lim θ→1¯q0= ¯qandf1RSB(¯q1,¯q0|θ= 1) = fRS(¯q), our objective is to expand the 1RSB
quenched free-energy for θ≃1. To this purpose, we expand the self-consistency equations for ¯ q0and
¯q1to linear order in θ−1. Proceding as in the Hopfield model, we get
¯q0= ¯q+ (θ−1)A(¯q,˜q1(¯q)) (A.7)
¯q1= ˜q1(¯q) + (θ−1)B(¯q,˜q1(¯q)) (A.8)

1RSB free-energy (A.4) where we replace ¯ q0and ¯q1with (A.7), (A.8), obtaining

We then study the sign of (A.11), where ¯ qand ˜q1(¯q) are the solutions of the self-consistency equations
(A.3) and (A.9), respectively. To this purpose, it is useful to study the behaviour of the function
K(¯q, x) for x∈[0,¯q]. For x= ¯q, we have K(¯q,¯q) = 0, while the extremum of K(¯q, x) is found from

By numerically solving the self-consistency equations (A.3) and (A.9), we can verify that ˜ q1(¯q) = ¯q
for all temperatures, hence this limit can be justified a posteriori for the SK model (see Fig. 4, left
panel). We anticipate that this remains true for the Ising P-spin model analysed in the next section.

A.2 The Ising P-spin model
In this section, we consider a system of NIsing spins σi=±1,i= 1, . . . , N governed by the Hamil-

where Ji1,...,iPare Gaussian i.i.d. variables, Ji1,...,iP∼ N(0, J2). As in the previous cases, the order
parameter of the model is the two-replica overlap qdefined in (2.4). The quenched free-energy in RS
assumption, at inverse temperature βreads as [27]

From now on, we imply the dependence of gand of the RS and 1RSB quenched free energies fRS,
f1RSBonβ′andJ. The aim is to prove that the 1RSB approximation of the quenched free-energy is
smaller than the replica symmetric one, above a critical value of the parameter β′J.
As before, we note that lim θ→1¯q0= ¯qandf1RSB(¯q1,¯q0|θ= 1) = fRS(¯q) and we aim at expanding the
1RSB quenched free-energy for θ≃1. To this purpose, we first expand the self-consistency equations
for ¯q0and ¯q1to linear order in θ−1, to obtain
¯q0= ¯q+ (θ−1)A(¯q,˜q1(¯q)) (A.23)
¯q1= ˜q1(¯q) + (θ−1)B(¯q,˜q1(¯q)) (A.24)

1RSB free-energy (A.20) where we replace ¯ q0and ¯q1with (A.23), (A.24), obtaining

x∈[0,¯q]. For x= ¯q, we have K(¯q,¯q) = 0, while the extremum of K(¯q, x) is found from

By numerically solving the self-consistency equations (A.19) and (A.25), we can check that the pa-
rameters ¯ qand ˜q1(¯q), are indeed equal at all temperatures see Fig. 4 (mid and right panels), hence
the above limit is justified a posteriori.
A.3 P-spin spherical model
In this section we consider the spherical P-spin model, introduced for the first time in [24]. The
Hamiltonian of the model is the same as in (A.17), however the Nspins σiare now real variables,
satisfying the so-called ’spherical’ constraintPN
i=1σ2
i=N. As in previous cases, the order parameter
is the two-replica overlap qintroduced in (2.4). In the thermodynamic limit, at inverse temperature
β, the quenched free-energy under the RS assumption (2.6) is given by
−2βfRS(¯q|β) =β2
2(1−¯qP) + log(1 −¯q) +¯q
1−¯q, (A.33)
where ¯ qfulfills the self-consistency equation
β2
2P¯qP−1=¯q
(1−¯q)2(A.34)
– 19 –For later convenience, it is useful to note that the temperature T⋆at which ¯ qbecomes non-zero within
the RS theory is found by demanding that (A.34) allows non-zero solutions satisfying
2
PT2= ¯qP−2(1−¯q)2(A.35)
Denoting the RHS with f(¯q) and noting that f(0) = f(1) = 0, a simple graphical argument shows
that a non-zero solution exists when the LHS is smaller than f(¯q) evaluated at its maximum point
q=P−2
P, i.e. for T < T⋆with T⋆=p
2(P−2)P−2/PP−1[16, 24].
Within the 1RSB assumption (2.12), the quenched free-energy evaluates to

From now on, we imply the dependence of fRSandf1RSB onβ. We note that for θ= 1, (A.37)
becomes equal to (A.34), hence ¯ q0(θ= 1) = ¯ qand we also have f1RSB(¯q1,¯q0|θ)|θ=1=fRS(¯q). The aim
is to expand the 1RSB quenched free-energy around θ= 1 to linear orders in θ−1. To this purpose,
we expand the 1RSB self-consistency equations around θ= 1 to obtain

where B(¯q0,¯q1) is as in (C.18). As noted above, if θ= 1, ¯ q0(θ= 1) = ¯ q, while ¯ q1(θ= 1) fulfills the
following equation
β2
2P¯qP−1
1=¯q1
(1−¯q1)(A.41)
We will see below that the RS instability occurs at a temperature Tc> T⋆, hence the only solution of
(A.37) at Tcis ¯q0= 0. For θ= 1, this corresponds to the paramagnetic solution ¯ q= 0. For θ <1, the
solution ¯ q0= 0 remains valid as in the absence of external field all the states must be orthogonal to
each other, leading to a vanishing mutual overlap [16]. As the 1RSB theory requires ¯ q1>¯q0, we are
interested in the non-zero solution of (A.41), which we can denote with ˜ q1and can be found explicitly
from
¯qP−2
1(1−¯q1) =2
PT2(A.42)
– 20 –Denoting the LHS with g(¯q1) and noting that g(0) = g(1) = 0, and reasoning as for T⋆, a non-zero
solution exists when the RHS is smaller than g(¯q1) evaluated at its maximum point ¯ q⋆
1= (P−2)/(P−1),
giving T <p
P(P−2)P−2/2(P−1)P−1[16]. Next, we compute the derivative w.r.t. θof−2βf1RSB
at ¯q0= ¯qand ¯q1= ˜q1:
K(˜q1,¯q) =∂θ(−2βf1RSB(¯q1,¯q0|θ))|θ=1= log1−˜q1

Substituting ¯ q= 0 and the value of ˜ q1= ¯q⋆
1this evaluates to
K(¯q∗
1,0) = 2 −4
P−log(P−1) (A.44)
which is always negative for P >2, implying
f1RSB(˜q∗

2β
< fRS(0). (A.45)
This shows that at the temperature Tc=p
P(P−2)P−2/2(P−1)P−1, where a non-zero overlap ¯ q1
first emerges, the RS theory becomes unstable, as known in the literature [16, 24]. It can be easily
verified that Tc> T⋆for all P >2.
B Expanding around θ= 0
Although we have so far regarded the limit θ→1 (where ¯ q0= ¯qandf1RSB =fRS) as the physical one,
in the opposite limit, θ→0, we would equally find, for all the models considered above, f1RSB =fRS
(with ¯ q1= ¯q), suggesting that a similar analysis could have been carried for θ→0.
In this section we present such analysis for the Hopfield model, the Hebbian networks with multi-node
interactions and the spherical P-spin. The same analysis can be carried out for the other spin-glass
models considered in Appendix A. Given the strong similarity of the SK and the Ising P-spin models
with the Hopfield and the dense associative memory models, respectively, we will not report such
analysis here.

As (B.1) is identical to (2.9), in the limit θ→0, ¯q1is equal to the RS order parameter ¯ q. Similarly,
one can show that
lim
θ→0¯m1= ¯m (B.3)
and can easily verify that f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)|θ=0=fRS( ¯m,¯q). Our purpose is then to prove that for
small but finite values of θthe 1RSB expression of the quenched free-energy is smaller than the RS
expression, i.e. f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)< fRS( ¯m,¯q), below a critical line in the parameters space ( α, β).
To this purpose, we expand the 1RSB quenched free-energy around θ= 0 -namely around the replica
symmetric expression- to the first order, to write
f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ) =f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)|θ=0+θ∂θf1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)|θ=0, (B.4)
where f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)|θ=0=fRS( ¯m,¯q). To determine when the RS solution becomes unstable,
i.e.f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)< fRS( ¯m,¯q) we inspect the sign of ∂θf1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ)|θ=0. To evaluate the
latter, we need to expand the self-consistency equations for ¯ q0, ¯q1and ¯m1around θ= 0 to linear
orders in θ. Using (B.1) and denoting
g0( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0) =β¯m1+βz(1)√α¯q0
∆1(¯q1)+βz(2)p
α(¯q1−¯q0)
∆1(¯q1), (B.5)
we obtain
¯q1=E1E2tanh2g0( ¯m,¯q1,¯q0) +θA( ¯m1,¯q0,¯q1) (B.6)
where A( ¯m1,¯q0,¯q1) is a function of ¯ q0and ¯q1that will drop out of the calculation, whose expression
is provided in (C.4). It follows from (B.1) that to O(θ0), ¯q1is equal to the RS order parameter ¯ qso
we can rewrite (B.6) as
¯q1= ¯q+θA( ¯m1,¯q0,¯q). (B.7)
Following the same path for ¯ q0, and using (B.7), we have
¯q0= ˜q0( ¯m,¯q) +θB( ¯m1,¯q0,¯q) (B.8)
where B( ¯m1,¯q0,¯q) is provided in (C.5) and will drop out of the calculation, and we have denoted with
˜q0( ¯m,¯q) the solution of
¯q0=E1(E2tanhg0( ¯m,¯q0,¯q))2. (B.9)
Finally, we can write the magnetization as
¯m1= ¯m+θC( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q)) (B.10)
where C( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q)) is given in (C.6) and rewrite (B.7) and (B.8) as
¯q1= ¯q+θA( ¯m,˜q0( ¯m,¯q),¯q) (B.11)
¯q0= ˜q0( ¯m,¯q) +θB( ¯m,˜q0( ¯m,¯q),¯q) (B.12)
– 22 –Using (B.11), (B.10) and (B.12) to evaluate the derivative of f1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ) w.r.t. θand finally
setting θ= 0, we obtain:
K( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q)) := ∂θ(−βf1RSB( ¯m1,¯q1,¯q0|θ))|θ=0

(B.13)
Next, we study the sign of (B.13), where ¯ qand ˜q0( ¯m,¯q) are the solutions of the self-consistency
equations (2.9) and (B.9), respectively. To this purpose, it is useful to study the behaviour of the
function K( ¯m,¯q, x) for x∈[0,¯q]. For x= ¯q, we have K( ¯m,¯q,¯q) = 0, regardless of the value assigned
to ¯m, while the extremum of K( ¯m,¯q, x) is found from
∂xK( ¯m,¯q, x) =β2αx

as
x=E1(E2tanhg0( ¯m,¯q, x))2≡˜q0( ¯m,¯q), (B.14)
from Eq. (B.9). Given that K( ¯m,¯q, x) vanishes for x= ¯q, if the extremum x= ˜q0( ¯m,¯q) is global in
the domain considered, we must have that K( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q))>0 ifx= ˜q0( ¯m,¯q) is a maximum and
K( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q))<0 ifx= ˜q0( ¯m,¯q) is a minimum. Therefore, if

is negative, K( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q)) is positive and f1RSB( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q)|θ)< fRS( ¯m,¯q), hence the RS theory
becomes unstable when the expression in the curly brackets in (B.15) becomes negative i.e. for

Interestingly, also in this case, the result found by Coolen in [19] using the de Almeida and Thouless’
approach [25], is recovered from the expression above in the limit ˜ q0( ¯m,¯q)→¯q. Solving numerically ¯ q
and ˜q0( ¯m,¯q) from the self-consistency equations (2.9) and (B.9), respectively, one can verify that these
two quantities are indeed identical for any temperature, and the resulting RS instability line coincides
with the classical AT line and the critical line given in (2.33), obtained by expanding around θ= 1,
see Fig. 5 (left panel). We anticipate that this will remain the case for Hebbian networks with P-node
interactions, that we will analyse in the next section (see mid and right panels of Fig. 5). Although
we do not report such analysis here, we have checked that this is also the case for the SK model.
B.2 Hebbian Networks with multi-node interactions
Here we apply the same analysis to Hebbian networks with multi-node interactions, defined by the
Hamiltonian given in Eq. (3.1). Our objective is to prove that the 1RSB quenched free-energy is
smaller than its replica symmetric counterpart i.e. f1RSB(β′, α, θ)< fRS(β′, α) above a critical value
of the effective parameter√αβ′. To this purpose we expand, to linear orders in θ, the 1RSB quenched
free-energy around θ= 0, as shown in (B.4). Since the self-consistency equations also depend on θ,
we need to expand them too. Following the same steps as in the Hopfield model, we can write ¯ m1as
– 23 –Figure 5 : RS instability lines for the Hopfield model (left) and Hebbian networks with P-node
interactions, with P= 4 (mid) and P= 6 (right), obtained via our method for θ→0 and θ→1. In

in (B.10), with C( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q)) as in (C.12), ¯ q1as in (B.7), with A( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q)) given in (C.10),
and ¯q0as given in (B.8), where ˜ q0( ¯m,¯q) is the solution of the self-consistency equation
¯q0=E1(E2tanhg( ¯m,¯q,¯q0))2(B.17)
andB( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q)) is given in (C.11). With the above expressions in hand, we can now calculate
the derivative of f1RSB w.r.t. θwhen θ= 0, as needed in (B.4)

Again, we have that K( ¯m,¯q,¯q) = 0, regardless of the value assigned to ¯ m(this follows from the fact
that for θ= 0, ¯ qis an extremum of the free-energy). Next, we inspect the sign of K( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q)).
To this purpose, we study K( ¯m,¯q, x) for x∈[0,¯q] and locate its extrema, which are found from
∂xK( ¯m,¯q, x) =β′2αP(P−1)
4xP−2h
x−E1(E2tanhg( ¯m,¯q, x))2i
= 0 (B.19)
as
x=E1(E2tanhg( ¯m,¯q, x))2≡˜q0( ¯m,¯q) (B.20)
where the last equality follows from (B.17). Under the assumption that the extremum x= ˜q0( ¯m,¯q) is
global in the domain considered and reasoning as in the Hopfield case, we have that K( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q))>
0 ifx= ˜q0( ¯m,¯q) is a maximum and K( ¯m,¯q,˜q0( ¯m,¯q))<0 if it is a minimum. In particular, if

The resulting critical line is found to be identical to the critical line (3.11) obtained from the expansion
around θ= 1 (see Fig. 5, mid and right panels).

Expanding for small θthe self-consistency equations (A.37), (A.38) to linear orders, we get

where the expression for A(¯q0,¯q1) and B(¯q0,¯q1) are provided in (C.19) and (C.20), respectively. If
θ= 0, summing the two equations gives
β2
2P¯qP−1
1=¯q1
(1−¯q1)2(B.25)
showing that, to orders O(θ0), ¯q1= ¯q, while ¯ q0fulfills the following self-consistency equation
β2
2P¯qP−1
0=¯q0
(1−¯q1)2(B.26)
whose solution is denoted with ˜ q0(¯q). The latter equation is solved by ˜ q0(¯q) = 0 (which corresponds to
the paramagnetic solution and remains valid when ergodicity is broken, as explained earlier). Similarly,
¯q1= 0 is always a solution of (B.25), however the 1RSB scenario requires ¯ q1>0. As explained in the
previous section, such non-zero solution appears at T≤T⋆=p
2(P−2)P−2/PP−1, which is below
Tcfor any P >2, hence we can immediately conclude that the instability of the RS theory occurs at
the larger temperature Tc, without further comparing the free-energies 1RSB and RS for θclose to
zero.
C Contributions to sub-leading orders
In this appendix we provide expressions for all the functions that we left unspecified in the main text,
as they did not contribute to leading orders, including the functions A(¯q0,¯q1) and B(¯q0,¯q1) for all the
models considered.
