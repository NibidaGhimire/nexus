Abstract
UnlikeF(R) gravity, pure metric F(T) gravity in the vacuum dominated era, ends up with an imagina ry
action and is therefore not feasible. This eerie situation m ay only be circumvented by associating a scalar
ﬁeld, which can also drive inﬂation in the very early univers e. We show that, despite diverse claims, F(T)
theory admits Noether symmetry only in the pressure-less du st era in the form F(T)∝Tn, nbeing odd
integers. A suitable form of F(T), admitting a viable Friedmann-like radiation dominated e ra, together with
early deceleration and late-time accelerated expansion in the pressure-less dust era, has been proposed.
Keywords:
F(T) gravity, Noether symmetry.
1 Introduction
It is almost unanimously believed that the luminosity distance versus r edshift (non-linear) curve observed from
Sn1a data, is a consequence of recent accelerated expansion of t he universe. A wide class of scalar ﬁeld (dark
energy) theories were promoted to explain the fact. Consequent ly, search for dark energy in the laboratory was
initiated almost a decade back [1,2], and recently it has apparently b een ruled out following a laboratory based
atom interferometry experiment, performed with incredible precis ion [3]. As an alternative to the dark energy,
initially, modiﬁed theories of gravity, such as F(R),F(G),F(R,G) etc., were developed and extensively studied.
Due to the fact that these theories suﬀer from Ostrogradsky ins tability, lately, alternative theories of gravity
(metric and symmetric teleparallel theories) are in the lime light. Thes e are called ‘alternatives’, since instead of
curvature, which is the building block of ‘general theory of relativity ’ (GTR), metric and symmetric teleparallel
theories are built from the torsion and non-metricity (general aﬃn e connection) respectively. Our concern in this
manuscript, is the generalised version ( F(T)) of metric teleparallel gravity theory.
In the recent years, a generalized version of the so-called ‘telepar allel gravity’ [4], namely the F(T) theory
of gravity (where, Tstands for the trace of the torsion tensor), also dubbed as ‘grav ity with torsion’ has been
proposed as an alternative to both the dark energy issue and the m odiﬁed theories of gravity. Factually, F(T)
teleparallel theory of gravity was primarily proposed to drive inﬂatio n [5,6]. Later, it was applied to drive the
current accelerated expansion of the present universe without c onsidering dark energy [7,8]. Thereafter, it has
drawn a lot of attention and has been explored vastly in diﬀerent con texts [?,9–38,40–42]. It is worth mentioning
thatF(T)∝Tleads to GTR, apart from a divergent term, and therefore, it is not required to supplement the
action with the Gibbons-Hawking-York term. The very interesting f eature of F(T) gravity is that, very much like

1Lanczos-Lovelock gravity, it gives second-order ﬁeld equations, as a result of which Ostrogradsky’s instability is
avoided. In this manuscript, our aim is to explore a physically reasona ble form of the metric teleparallel theory.
For the sake of self-standing, we brieﬂy demonstrate the basic ing redients of the metric teleparallel theory and
review the applicability of Noether theorem in diﬀerent contexts.
The modiﬁed teleparallel action of F(T) gravity is given by the following action,
A=/integraldisplay
d4x|e|F(T)+Sm, (1)
in the units c= 16πG= 1, where |e|= detei
µ=√−gandSmis the matter action. Teleparallelism [43] uses
a vierbein ﬁeld ei(xµ) as dynamical object (it consists of four linearly independent vect or ﬁelds forming a local
basis for the tangent bundle, instead of the coordinate basis), wh ich is an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
at each point xµof the manifold ei, whereeij=ηij,iruns from 0 ,1,2,3, andηij= diag(1 ,−1,−1,−1). The
vectoreican be described by its components eµ
i,µ= 0, 1, 2, 3 in a coordinate basis, i.e. ei=eµ
i∂µ. In the
above, Latin indices refer to the tangent space, while Greek indices label coordinates on the manifold. The metric
tensor is obtained from the dual vierbein as gµν(x) =ηijei
µ(x)ej
ν(x). In contrast to the (GTR) which uses the
torsion-less Levi-Civita connection, as already mentioned, the cur vature-less Weitzenb¨ ock connection is applied in
‘Teleparallelism’ [44], for which the non-vanishing torsion is,
Tλ
µν≡eλ

The above tensor encompasses all the information regarding the g ravitational ﬁeld. The teleparallel equivalent of
General Relativity (TEGR) Lagrangian is built with the torsion (2), an d its dynamical equations for the vierbein
imply Einstein’s equations for the metric. The teleparallel Lagrangian given in [45–47] is,
LT=SρµνTρ

where, the tensor Sρµν

is built from the contorsion tensor, Kαβ
ρ, given by
Kµν

which equals the diﬀerence between Weitzenb¨ ock and Levi-Civita co nnections.
Now, in order to study cosmological consequence of the said altern ative theory of gravity, a particular form
ofF(T) is required. Before setting a form of F(T) by hand or reconstructing it from the late history of cosmic
evolution, it is always desirable to ﬁnd its form following some physical c onsideration; as for example, invoking
Noether symmetry, which had been applied earlier in diﬀerent modiﬁed theories of gravity in particular, with
tremendous success. De Ritis et.al. [48] had applied Noether symmet ry for the ﬁrst time in scalar-tensor theory
of gravity, and found an exponential form of the potential, which c an drive inﬂation in the very early universe.
Such an exciting result inspired authors to extensively apply Noethe r symmetry in diﬀerent theories of gravity,
such as, scalar-tensor theories, higher order theories, Gauss- Bonnet gravity, quantum cosmology and also F(R)
theory, and so on. Particularly, since F(T) gravity appeared as an alternative to F(R) gravity theory, therefore,
for the sake of comparison, we enlist in table 1, the available Noether symmetries for F(R) theory of gravity, in
the background of isotropic and homogeneous Robertson-Walker (RW) metric

in diﬀerent eras [49–53]. Likewise, application of Noether symmetry t o explore suitable forms of F(T) is also
available in the literature [54–59]. However, due to diﬀeomorphic invar iance, the (0
0) and (i
0) equations of Ein-
stein are altogether four: the energy (Hamiltonian) and the momen ta constraint equations. Thus, Gravity is
a constrained system, and Noether symmetry is not on-shell for s uch a constrained system, and every available
Noether symmetry of gravitationaltheory, is required to satisfy the four aforesaid equations [60–62]. Alternatively,
application of (modiﬁed) Poisson ﬁrst theorem happens to be a stra ight forward technique to check consistency,
in this regard [63,64]. In F(T) gravity theory however, apart from the metric coeﬃcients, the conﬁguration space
is spanned by ( T,˙T). Unfortunately, due to absence of ˙Tterm in the action, the Hessian determinant vanishes
and the action becomes singular. As a result, the phase-space str ucture remains obscure [65], and Poisson theo-
rem cannot be applied. Hamiltonian has been constructed following Dir ac constrained analysis, but it contains
momenta in the denominator and hence impossible to handle [65]. In the context of RW metric, it is therefore
suggestive either to incorporate lapse function ( N) in the symmetry equation, without ﬁxing it a priori [66,67],
or to incorporate the constraint in the Noether equation, throug h a Lagrange multiplier [68,69]. However, in both
the situations, the lapse function and the Lagrange multiplier remain arbitrary, and one does not know, which
form would give a symmetry.
In the literature, although a host of Noether symmetries for F(T) gravity, together with associated conserved
currents had been explored, [54–59], the consistency of the availa ble Noether symmetries in connection with the
(0
0) equation of Einstein, had not been inspected. We therefore take up this task in the present manuscript. In the
following section, we explore Noether symmetry following the Lagran ge multiplier technique for F(T) teleparallel
gravity, in the background of spatially ﬂat homogeneous and isotro pic Robertson-Walker space-time. We also
incorporate the available symmetry in the energy (0
0) equation of Einstein, for a consistency check. It is unveiled
that pure F(T) leads to imaginary action in the vacuum dominated era, and the only p ropitious result found is
F(T)∝Tn, but for odd integral values of n, in the pressure-less dust era. In section 3, we try to construct the
form ofF(T) in view of a viable (Friedmann-like decelerated) radiation era. In view of all our ﬁndings we propose
a reasonable form of F(T) in section 4. Section 5 concludes our work.
2 Noether Symmetry analysis in F(T) Teleparallel Gravity:
Before we commence, let us enlist all the claims [54]- [59] for available fo rms ofF(T) together with associated
conservedcurrents in diﬀerent eras in table 2. As already mentione d, primarily our aim is to scrutinize such claims.
For this purpose, our starting point is action (1), in which the matte r action Smincludes both perfect ﬂuid and
dark matter associated with a barotropic equation of state ω. In the spatially ﬂat Robertson-Walker space-time,

the vierbein is

µ= diag(1 ,a(t),a(t),a(t)). (8)
In the above, a(t) is the cosmological scale factor. Our motive is to explore Noether s ymmetry in diﬀerent eras,
satisfying the only constraint, viz., the (0
0) equation of Einstein.

Canonical formulation of F(T) theory following Lagrange multiplier technique [54–59] may be cast with ﬁnite
degrees of freedom only. In this formalism, T+6˙a2
a2= 0 is treated as a constraint in the spatially ﬂat Robertson-
Walker metric (7). This constraint is introduced in the action (1) thr ough a Lagrangemultiplier λ. In the presence
of a barotropic ﬂuid, the action may therefore be expressed as,
A= 2π2/integraldisplay/bracketleftBig
F(T)−λ/braceleftBig
T+6/parenleftBig˙a2
a2/parenrightBig/bracerightBig

a3dt, (9)
where,ρ0is the present value of matter density, either for radiation ( ρr0) or pressure-less dust ( ρm0), andωis
the equation of state parameter. Now varying the action with resp ect toTone gets λ=F′(T), where F′(T) is
the derivative of F(T) with respect to T. Substituting the expression of λ, one can express the above action (9)
in the following form,
A= 2π2/integraldisplay
[−6a˙a2F′+a3(F−F′T)−ρ0a−3ω]dt. (10)
It is important to mention that, being devoid of the time derivative of T, the Hessian determinant vanishes.
Therefore the above action, unlike F(R) theory of gravity, is singular [65], although it is often referred to as
canonical. Nonetheless, for Noether symmetry analysis, such an a ction is well-suited. The point Lagrangian is
therefore,
L(a,˙a,T,˙T) =/bracketleftbig
−6a˙a2F′+a3(F−F′T)−ρ0a−3ω/bracketrightbig
, (11)
and the ﬁeld equations in terms of the Hubble parameter H=˙a
aare,

4T=−6H2(13)
F−2TF′−ρ0a−3(ω+1)=F+12H2F′−ρ0a−3(ω+1)= 0 (14)
Note that, the constraint has been retrieved in equation (13). On e can also trivially check that the ﬁeld equations
of GTR may be recovered for F(T)∝T=−6H2. As mentioned, we explore Noether symmetries corresponding
to the point Lagrangian (11) in the following . Noether theorem stat es that, if there exists a vector ﬁeld X, for
which the Lie derivative of a given Lagrangian Lvanishes i.e. £XL=XL= 0, the Lagrangian admits Noether
Symmetry together with a conservedcurrent Σ = iXθL, whereθLis the Cartanone form. We repeat that Noether
symmetry is usually on-shell, but not for constrained system, we ar e dealing with. So once we ﬁnd a symmetry,
we shall check its consistency in connection with equation (14).
Noether equations: The conﬁguration space of the Lagrangian (11) under considerat ion isM(a,T) and the
corresponding tangent space is TM(a,T,˙a,˙T). Hence the generic inﬁnitesimal generator of the Noether Symme try
is,
X=α1∂
∂a+β1∂
∂T+ ˙α1∂
∂˙a+˙β1∂
∂˙T, (15)
where,α1=α1(a,T) andβ1=β1(a,T). Further, the Cartan one form is:
θL=∂L
∂ada+∂L
∂TdT, (16)
and the associated constant of motion is, Σ = iXθL, as already mentioned. Now using the existence condition for
Noether Symmetry, viz. £XL=XL= 0, we obtain the Noether equation. Thereafter we equate the co eﬃcients
of ˙a2,˙T2, ˙a˙Talong with the term free from derivatives respectively to zero as us ual, and obtain the following
system of partial diﬀerential equations:
α1F′+β1aF′′+2aF′α1,a= 0, (17)
α′
1= 0, (18)
3α1(F−TF′)+3ωρ0a−3(ω+1)−aβ1TF′′= 0. (19)
2.1 Available symmetries in pure vacuum era:
It is important to mention that, particles are created, once inﬂatio n is over, due to the oscillation of the scalar
ﬁeld. Thus, very early vacuum-dominated era might contain a scalar ﬁeld, but is devoid of barotropic ﬂuid in any
of its form. In the absence of the scalar ﬁeld and for ρ= 0 =p, the ﬁeld equations (12) and (14) are considerably
simpliﬁed, and combined to yield
48H2˙HF′′−4˙HF′= 0, (20)
which may immediately be solved to obtain F(T)∝T1
2, which is the only allowed form of F(T) theory in
vacuum. It is not clear, despite such unique form, why attempts to ﬁnd forms of F(T) were taken up. In fact,
authors [54–56] attempted to ﬁnd Noether Symmetry in pure vacu um era and ended up with F∝Tn. Let us
now examine why such uncanny results appeared. The above set of Noether equations (17), (18) and (19) admit
the following solutions in pure vacuum era, viz.
α1=a1−3
2n, β1=−3
na−3
2nT, F(T) =F0Tn, (21)
5and its associated conserved current, which reads as,
Σ =−12a(2−3
2n)˙aF′(T) =−12nF0a(2−3
2n)˙aTn−1. (22)
In the above and everywhere else, F0>0, ensures retrieval of GTR ( n= 1). One can now immediately solve the
above equation for a(t) as,

Although, the form of F(T)∝Tn(21) so obtained via Noether symmetry analysis, in the very early va cuum
dominated era, does not admit de-Sitter solution, the solution of th e scale factor (23) is clearly found to admit
power law inﬂation for n >3
2. For example, n= 3 implies a(t)∝(t−t0)2, andn >3 gives even faster rate of
the expansion of the early universe. However, before coming to a c onclusion, note that the (0
0) equation (14) for
F(T) =F0Tnin vacuum dominated era takes the form,
EL=−a3(F−2TF′) = (2n−1)F0a3Tn= 0, (24)

result only decelerated expansion is administered in the veryearly un iverse. Clearlythe claim that F(T)∝Tn, for
arbitrary n[54–56] is patently false. Note that, such a form of F(T) is meaningless, since F(T)∝T1

turns the action, imaginary. On the contrary F(R) theory of gravity, admits at least four reasonably viable forms
along with their associated conserved currents as depicted in table -1. Undoubtedly, vacuum era of F(R) gravity
has much reacher structure than F(T) teleparallel theory of gravity. It may be mentioned that in the pre sence of
a scalar ﬁeld on the contrary, Noether symmetry remains obscure , and arbitrary form of F(T) is admissible. It
is therefore suggestive to incorporate a scalar ﬁeld (dilatonic or Hig gs ﬁeld) which would be responsible to drive
inﬂation in the action F(T) [70].
2.2 Available symmetries in radiation-dominated era:
In the radiation dominated era, Noether symmetry does not exist, and indeed there is no such claim in the
literature too, in this regard. However, in F(R) theory of gravity, F(R) =F0R2admits Noether symmetry being
associated with the conserved current Σ = a3˙R(table-1). Again we ﬁnd that F(R) gravity has richer structure
thanF(T) teleparallel gravity theory in radiation dominated era.
2.3 Available symmetries in pressureless dust era:
In pressureless dust era, the above Noether equations (17), (1 8) and (19) signiﬁcantly admit the same solutions
(21), (22) as already found in vacuum era. Clearly, the scale facto r also admits the same solution (23). Apparently,
the same solutions are found as already presented in [57,58]. But, w e need to scrutinize the symmetries in the
light of the energy constraint equation of Einstein. For the available symmetry F(T) =F0Tn, the (0
0) equation
(14) takes the following form in the matter dominated era,
EL=−a3/parenleftbig
F−2TF′−ρm0a−3/parenrightbig
= (2n−1)F0a3Tn+ρm0= 0, (25)

6The above expression of ρm0, gives rise to some important consequences. Firstly, n∝negationslash=1
2, so that some amount
of matter ρm0(the structures) remain present in the universe. Note that in the process, the pathological form
F(T)∝√

is averted. Next, since F0>0, as already mentioned, so to ensure positivity of ρm0, we
must have n >1
2and 3n−1 = 2m, where m >0 is an integer ( m= 0 leads to n=1
3, which makes F(T)
imaginary, and hence is excluded). As a consequence, indeed one ﬁn ds admissible Noether symmetry in the form
F(T)∝Tn, but only for the odd integral values of n, such as, n= 1,3,5....etc. This indicates, apart from the

corresponding to F(T)∝T3,Σ∝a5H5;a(t)∝t10

This result is deﬁnitely encouraging.
3 Reconstruction from radiation era
The success of the standard (FLRW) model of cosmology lies in the r adiation and the early matter (pressure-less
dust) dominated era. Once the seeds of perturbation are found ( in view of an very early inﬂationary scenario), the
Friedmann-like decelerated radiation era exactly formulates the fo rmation of structures (stars, galaxies, clusters
and superclusters), along with the CMBR which occurred at a redsh ift value z≈1080. It is therefore primarily
required to associate a decelerated expansion in the radiation era, to envisage a viable evolution history of the
universe. It may be worth recapitulating that a Friedmann-like dece lerated expansion a(t)∝√
t, requires the
Ricci scalar to vanish ( R= 0). In the case of torsion, although F(T)∝Tleads to GTR, nonetheless, T= 0,
leads to a static universe, and a Friedmann-like decelerated expans ion is not obvious. To inspect the situation
here, we combine the ﬁeld equations (12) and (14) to ﬁnd,
ρ+p=ρ0(1+ω)a−3(ω+1)=4
3ρr0a−4= 48H2˙HF′′−4˙HF′=−4HF′′˙T−4˙HF′=−4d

where, we havesubstituted ω=1

present in the universe. Now seeking a solution in the form a=a0tn, wherea0andnare constants, one can
compute, H=n

6a4
0(4n−1)n4n(−6)2n−1T2n, (30)
apart from a constant of integration, which does not contribute t o the ﬁeld equations. Note that the ﬁrst term is
essentially a divergent term in the RW metric under consideration. Th us, we are left with the second term only.
Under the choice n=1
2, the radiation era evolves exactly like the standard (FLRW) model, a nd the action reduces
to that of GTR ( F(T)∝T). This is actually what we are searching for. Note that, one can also consider other
forms of F(T), by choosing njudiciously, keeping in mind that F(T)>0, to recover GTR, n <1 for decelerated
expansion, n∝negationslash=1
4to avert divergence, and ﬁnally the action has to be real. Satisfying all these conditions one can
easily check that, for1
4< n <1, the best option is to choose n=1
2, while for n <1
4, the decelerated expansion
is too slow to produce CMB at the right epoch.
4 Proposition:
It may be mentioned that the Ricci scalar measures the diﬀerence o f areas between a curved space and the ﬂat
space of a sphere (say), formed by the set of all points at a very s mall geodesic distance. From Einstein’s equation
it is found to be equal to the trace T of the energy momentum tenso r Tµν, i.e.R=Rµνgµν= Tµνgµν= T.
For electromagnetic ﬁeld the trace vanishes and hence the Ricci sc alar. As a result, in the radiation dominated
era, which initiated soon after the hot big-bang, the scalar curvat ure vanish ( R= 0), to realize a Friedmann-like
7radiation era a∝√
t. It is also important to mention that structure has to formation co mputed from the seeds
of perturbation generated during early inﬂationary era, is based o n the standard model of cosmology, which
requires R= T = 0, in the middle. This implies, unlike the scale factor, which evolves f rom a very small to
a large value with the cosmic expansion, the Ricci scalar does not evo lve in a continuous manner from a very
large to an insigniﬁcantly small value. However, a viable F(R) theory of gravity is still presented in the form
F(R) =αR+βR2+γR−1[74], orF(R) =αR+βR2+γR3
2[75], with the preoccupied assumption that R
evolves from a very large at the earlier epoch to an insigniﬁcantly sma ll value at present in a continuous manner,
so thatR2dominated in the early universe, leading to inﬂation, Rin the middle, to establish standard model,
andR−1/R3
2at present, to envisage accelerated expansion of the universe. C learly, this leads to a conceptual
problem. On the contrary, when torsion is attributed to gravity, u sually, a form such as F(T) =f0T+f1T2+···
is chosen to combat early deceleration in the Friedmann form/parenleftBig

followed by late-time cosmic acceler-
ation in the matter (pressure-less dust) dominated era. In view of our analysis, it is clear that F(T)∝Tgives

Therefore, it is not required to set T= 0, at any stage. This has a great conceptual advantage over mo diﬁed
theories of gravity.
In view of our current analysis, we ﬁnd that a scalar ﬁeld must be ass ociated in F(T) gravity theory, not only
to drive inﬂation, but also to avert the pathological behaviour of pu reF(T) gravity in the very early vacuum-
dominated era. Next, F∝T, gives the standard model of cosmology, both in the radiation and e arly matter
dominated era. Finally, in view of Noether analysis, instead of T2, one should associate T3and higher odd
integral powers in the action. That is, a viable form that might explain the cosmic evolutionary history may be
in the following form, F(T) =f0T+f1T3+···, and the action may be proposed as,
A=/integraldisplay/bracketleftbigg
f0T+f1T3+···+1
2˙φ2−V(φ)/bracketrightbigg√−gd4x, (31)
where, the scalar ﬁeld drives inﬂation at the very early stage, and d ecayed to an insigniﬁcant value in the process
of particle creation. Additionally, Tdominates in the middle to envisage the standard model, while odd-inte gral
higher order terms are responsible for late-time cosmic acceleratio n.
5 Concluding remarks:
Noether symmetry has been extensively studied in the literature fo r teleparallel gravity with torsion F(T), and
several claims were made regarding the forms of F(T) and associated conserved currents in vacuum and pressure-
less dust era, as presented in table 2. Nonetheless, it is trivial to no te that pure F(T) gravity is not empowered
with a meaningful form in vacuum. This is a major shortfall of gravity with torsion, and at least a scalar ﬁeld is
required to forestall F(T) gravity theory from such bizarre situation. Hence, unlike F(R) gravity, in which R2
term can steer inﬂation in the early universe, the scalar ﬁeld can only be responsible to drive inﬂation in F(T)
gravity theory. Obviously, unless, it can be shown that the scalar is almost completely used up in producing
particles at the end of inﬂation, and the rest are redshifted away, it would be a responsibility to observe its trace in
the present universe. Otherwise, the main objective to explain late -time acceleration without dark energy, would
be in vain.
It is also observed that radiation era does not yield any Noether sym metry, and as such there were no such
claim too. On the contrary, it is important to mention that, F(R) theory admits symmetry in radiation era,
which are enlisted in table 1. Result of the present analysis also revea ls the fact that the radiation and the
early pressure-less dust era is best described by F(T)∝T. This is a non-trivial result, since in GTR, the Ricci
scalar is proportional to the trace of the energy-momentum tens or, which vanishes for radiation and as a result
Friedmann-like ( a∝√
t) solution is admissible. Although, F(T)∝Tis TEGR, however, vanishing trace of
energy-momentum tensor does not enforce T= 0, but still, Friedmann-like cosmic evolution is admissible.
Finally, we ﬁnd that Noether symmetry indeed exists in the pressure -less dust era in the form F(T)∝Tn,
but only for odd integral values of n. In view of all these ﬁndings, we put forward an action (31), which m ight
possibly foretell the cosmic evolutionary history of the universe. A lthough, it is apparent that F(R) gravity has a
8much richer structure than the F(T) gravity theory, note that, unlike the Ricci curvature scalar, it is not required
to set torsion to vanish at any stage of cosmic evolution. Further, power lower than ﬁrst degree in Ris required
to explain late-time cosmic acceleration. Contrarily, in the case of to rsion higher degree terms are required for the
simple reason that, the Hubble parameteris reduced with expansion , and higher degree terms in Hubble parameter
falls oﬀ even faster, reducing the torsion considerably, and event ually leading to late-time cosmic acceleration. In
a nut-shell, late-time acceleration is an outcome of lesser torsion. I n this sense, F(T) gravity is apparently free
from conceptual problem.
