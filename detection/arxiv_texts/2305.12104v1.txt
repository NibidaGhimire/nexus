Abstract
Using Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLA S) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data,
I found that the SW Sex star V1315 Aql entered a low state early in 2023. As far as I know, this is the
ﬁrst such an event since the discovery of this object with obs ervations dating back to 1948. This object is
renowned for its nova shell and the nova explosion was estima ted to occur 500–1200 yr ago, although no direct
detection of a nova eruption was present in the historical re cord. The present low state probably occurred as
the mass-transfer rate from the nova-irradiated secondary decreased secularly. The present low state would
provide an opportunity to study the secondary in detail, whi ch has been hampered by the luminous accretion
disk in the past. I also provide the recent light curve of the c lassical nova LV Vul, which now shows high and
low states 50 yr after the nova eruption.
V1315 Aql was initially discovered as a variable star (=SVS 8 130) by Metik (1961). During a search for
ultraviolet-excess objects, Downes et al. (1986) detected this object (KPD 1911 +1212) and identiﬁed it to be an
eclipsing cataclysmic variable. Its spectrum was that of a h igh-excitation old nova0 (this term was used slightly
diﬀerently from the modern meaning), and unusually singly p eaked emission lines despite its high inclination
and the unusual behavior of the emission lines against the or bital phase already attracted attention. Downes
et al. (1986) classiﬁed V1315 Aql to be a member of high-excit ation (all eclipsing) old novae, including SW Sex,
LX Ser, DQ Her, RW Tri and V363 Aur as a group. These unusual emi ssion lines have been studied by many
authors (Szkody 1987; Szkody and Piche 1990; Dhillon et al. 1 991; Smith et al. 1993; Dhillon and Rutten 1995;
Hellier 1996). This object played an important role in estab lishing the concept of SW Sex stars (Thorstensen
et al. 1991; Hellier 1996).
This object received attention again by the discovery of a no va shell (Sahman et al. 2015, 2018). Using the
expansion velocity, Sahman et al. (2018) suggested that the nova eruption occurred 500–1200 yr ago. Sahman
et al. (2018) could not ﬁnd a corresponding “guest star” in ol d Chinese and Asian records compiled by Stephenson
(1976). Schaefer (2019) could not ﬁnd evidence for a nova eru ption in archival plates starting from 1889.
While inspecting of Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Aler t System (ATLAS: Tonry et al. 2018) forced pho-
tometry (Shingles et al. 2021) and Zwicky Transient Facilit y (ZTF: Masci et al. 2019)1data, I noticed that this
object entered a low state starting from early 2023 (vsnet-a lert 27760)2. As far as I know, this is the ﬁrst such
an event since the discovery of this object.
The typical high-state light curve (2016–2019) is shown in ﬁ gure 1. The object gradually faded and entered
a low state starting from 2023 (ﬁgure 2). Hellier (2000) sugg ested that SW Sex behavior is caused by episodes of
very high mass transfer, which are balanced by VY Scl low stat es (i.e. to adjust to the long-term mass transfer
by angular momentum loss from the binary). In the case of V131 5 Aql, the origin of very high mass transfer in
its high state appears to be the result of a nova explosion. Th e present low state would provide an opportunity
to study the secondary (such as the chemical composition) in detail, which has been hampered by the luminous
accretion disk in the past.
Several classical novae (not necessarily SW Sex stars) have been known to show low states recently. They
are summarized in table 1. For CP Lac see vsnet-alert 236213, which was originally detected by Gaia.4The
2020–2022 low state of DK Lac was detected in the ZTF data. The light curve of LV Vul from the ZTF data is
shown in ﬁgure 3. In addition to them, there are also more cand idates:
• IV Cep (1971): highly variable in the ZTF data. More than 1 ma g fading in 2018 December–2019 April,
2020 June–August, 2021 September–? (ending not recorded du e to the seasonal gap) and 2022 August–
September.
• V400 Per (1974): likely low state in early 2022; only three p ositive ZTF observations.
