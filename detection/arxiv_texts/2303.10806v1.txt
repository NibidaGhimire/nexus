with Time-Varying Weights
Xin-Yu Wang∗and Chung-Han Hsieh∗∗,Member, IEEE
Abstract —In this paper, we extend the existing double linear
policy by incorporating time-varying weights instead of co nstant
weights and study a certain robustness property, called rob ust
positive expectation (RPE), in a discrete-time setting. We prove
that the RPE property holds by employing a novel elementary
symmetric polynomials characterization approach and deri ve
an explicit expression for both the expected cumulative gai n-
loss function and its variance. To validate our theory, we pe r-
form extensive Monte Carlo simulations using various weigh ting
functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this policy can
be effectively incorporated with standard technical analy sis
techniques, using the moving average as a trading signal.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The Robust Positive Expectation (RPE) is a property that
ensures a trading policy has a positive expected proﬁt robus tly,
and it is closely related to the stochastic positivity of a
dynamical system in the control area. Some early work relate d
to robustness issues in ﬁnancial systems can be found in [ 1].
Later, a strategy called Simultaneous Long-Short (SLS) was
proposed; see [ 2], [3], and shown to guarantee the RPE in
markets with asset prices governed by geometric Brownian
motion (GBM).
Later, several extensions were proposed in the literature,
including generalization for Merton’s diffusion model in [ 4],
GBM model with time-varying parameters in [ 5], and any lin-
ear stochastic differential equation (SDE) in [ 6]. Additionally,
the SLS strategy was extended to the proportional-integral (PI)
controller in [ 7], to the latency trading in [ 8], and coupled SLS
strategy on pair trading for two correlated assets was studi ed
in [9], [10]. In [ 11], a robust design strategy for stock trading
via feedback control is proposed. [ 12] proposed a generalized
SLS with different weight settings on long and short positio ns.
Recently, [ 13] considered a long-only afﬁne feedback control
with a stop-loss order.
In [14], a modiﬁed SLS strategy, called double linear policy ,
was proposed to solve an optimal weight selection problem
using the mean-variance approach in a discrete-time settin g
while preserving the RPE property. Then [ 15] established a

present. However, previous work including [ 14], [15] and
many SLS literature assumed constant weight, investing the
same proportion of account value in each stage. This paper
extends the weight of double linear policy from constant to a
broad class of time-varying functions in a discrete-time se tting
and proves that the RPE property still holds for this extensi on.
A. Contributions of the Paper
Proving an RPE property for a policy with time-varying
weights is known to be challenging.1This paper addresses this
challenge by using a novel elementary symmetric polynomials
characterization approach. We extend the existing results by
showing that the RPE property holds for the double linear
policy with time-varying weights. Closed-form expression s for
the expected cumulative gain-loss function and its varianc e
are provided. Additionally, we illustrate how the proposed
policy can be incorporated with the common technical analys is
technique. The results presented in this paper contribute t o the
literature on robustness in ﬁnancial systems.
II. P ROBLEM FORMULATION
For stage k= 0,1,2,..., letS(k)>0be the under-
lying risky asset price at stagek. Then the associated per-
period return is given by X(k) :=S(k+1)−S(k)
S(k).Assume
thatX(k)∈[Xmin,Xmax]for allkwith probability one,
and known bounds −1< Xmin<0< Xmax<∞.
Additionally, assume that XminandXmax are in the support
ofX(k). Furthermore, assume that X(k)are independent
with a common mean E[X(k)] =µ∈Rand common
variance var(X(k)) =σ2>0for allk.2In the sequel, we
assume that the trades incur zero transaction costs and that
the underlying asset has perfect liquidity. This setting se rves
as a good starting point for building the model and is closely
related to the frictionless market in ﬁnance; see [ 16].
A. Double Linear Policy with Time-Varying Weights
In [14] and many SLS literature, the trading policy is pro-
posed with constant weights. This paper extends the constan t
weights to a time-varying weighting function. With initial
1The conventional method for proving RPE of a trading policy w ith constant
weight often relies on a key identity that (1+x)k+(1−x)k>2for allk >1
andx/negationslash= 0. However, this approach may not apply when xvaries over time,
as in the case of the policies with time-varying weights.
2This setting does not assume an underlying stochastic proce ss governing
the prices of the risky asset and is less restrictive than the typical independent
and identically distributed returns assumption.account value V(0) :=V0>0, we spilt it into two parts:
Taking a fraction α∈[0,1], deﬁneVL(0) :=αV0as the
initial account value for long position and VS(0) := (1 −α)V0
forshort position. If α= 1, we are in a long-only position
whileα= 0 corresponds to a pure short position.
The trading policy π(·)is given by π(k) :=πL(k)+πS(k),
whereπLandπSare of double linear forms:
/braceleftBigg
πL(k) =w(k)VL(k);
πS(k) =−w(k)VS(k).(1)
The weighting function w(k)∈ W:= [0,wmax]for allkwith
wmax:= min{1,1/Xmax}and is assumed to be causal ; i.e.,
it may depend only on the information up to stage k−1.
Anyw(k)∈ W is called admissible weight. This condition
is closely related to the survival trades; see Section II-B.
Hence, the account values under the double linear policy πL
andπS, denoted by VL(k)andVS(k), can be described as the
following linear time-varying stochastic difference equa tion:
/braceleftBigg
VL(k+1) =VL(k)+X(k)πL(k)+(VL(k)−πL(k))rf;
VS(k+1) =VS(k)+X(k)πS(k),
whererf≥0is ariskless rate for a bank account or a treasury
bond.3Note that when rf>0, account proﬁt increases.
Hence, as seen later in sections to follow, when studying the
robustness of the double linear policy, we assume without lo ss
of generality rf:= 0. Then the account value for long position
reduce to VL(k+ 1) =VL(k) +X(k)πL(k). Therefore, the
overall account value for both long and short positions at
stagekis given by
V(k) =VL(k)+VS(k) =V0(αR+(k)+(1−α)R−(k)),
whereR+(k) :=/producttextk−1
j=0(1 +w(j)X(j))andR−(k) :=/producttextk−1
j=0(1−w(j)X(j)).
B. Survivability Considerations
FixV0>0andα∈(0,1), we ensure that the trades are
survivable for all k; i.e., the w-value that can potentially lead
toV(k)<0is disallowed. To see this, for stage k= 0,1,...,
ﬁxw(k)∈ W . We observe that for the long position, we
haveVL(k)≥V0α(1 +wmaxXmin)k>0sincewmax≤1
andXmin>−1. On the other hand, for the short position,
we also have VS(k)≥V0(1−α)(1−wmaxXmax)k≥0since
wmax≤1/Xmax. Therefore, the overall account value satisﬁes
V(k) =VL(k)+VS(k)>0for allkwith probability one.
C. Robust Positive Expectation Problem
The primary objective of this paper is to study the following
RPE problem.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Robust Positive Expectation) .For stage k=
0,1,..., letV0>0be the initial account value, and V(k)be
the account value at stage k. Deﬁne the expected cumulative
3In practice, when shorting an asset, the corresponding proc eeds are
typically held as collateral by the broker to cover any potential losses from
the short position. These proceeds are generally not availa ble for immediate
reinvestment into a riskless asset, such as a bank account or treasury bond.gain-loss function up to stage kasG(k) :=E[V(k)]−V0.
A trading policy is said to have a robust positive expecta-
tion (RPE) property if it ensures that G(k)>0for allk >1
and under all market conditions.
III. G AIN-LOSSANALYSIS
Fork >0, letX:={X(j)}k−1
j=0andw:={w(j)}k−1
j=0.
WithV0>0, consider the double linear policy with α∈(0,1)
and weight w(k)∈ W for allk. The cumulative trading gain-
loss function up to stage kis given by
G(α,w,k,X) :=V(k)−V0
=V0(αR+(k)+(1−α)R−(k)−1),
and the expectation is G(α,w,k,µ) :=E[G(α,w,k,X)]. If
the weights are constant; i.e., w(k) :=wfor allk, then the
RPE property is readily established when α= 1/2, see [ 15].
However, difﬁculties arise when the weighting function is
time-varying. To address this, a set of elementary symmetric
polynomials4inkvariables, {w(0),...,w(k−1)}, are con-
sidered and deﬁned as {e1(k),e2(k),...ek(k)}with
ej(k) :=/summationdisplay
0≤i1<i2<···<ij≤k−1w(i1)w(i2)···w(ij)
forij∈N. Note that ej(k)≥0for alljandk, which is
the sum of the jth multiplication term of admissible weights.
The following example illustrates the calculation of eleme ntary
symmetric polynomials.
Example 3.1 (Elementary Symmetric Polynomials) .This ex-
ample illustrates the calculation of the elementary symmet ric
polynomials ej(k). Speciﬁcally, for k= 1, the polynomials
to be calculate is {e1(1)}which is given by e1(1) =w(0).
For stage k= 2 , the elementary symmetric polynomi-
als{e1(2),e2(2)}are given by
e1(2) =/summationdisplay
0≤i1≤1w(i1) =w(0)+w(1);
e2(2) =/summationdisplay
0≤i1<i2≤1w(i1)w(i2) =w(0)w(1).
Similarly, for k= 3, the elementary symmetric polynomi-
als{e1(3),e2(3),e3(3)}becomes
e1(3) =/summationdisplay
0≤i1≤2w(i1) =w(0)+w(1)+w(2);
e2(3) =/summationdisplay
0≤i1<i2≤2w(i1)w(i2)

e3(3) =/summationdisplay
0≤i1<i2<i3≤2w(i1)w(i2)w(i3) =w(0)w(1)w(2).
As seen later in this section, the representation of elemen-
tary symmetric polynomials is useful for proving the RPE
property; see Lemmas 3.2and3.3to follow. Deﬁne shorthand
notations R+(k) :=E[R+(k)]andR−(k) :=E[R−(k)].
4We say that e(·)is a symmetric polynomial if for any permutation σ
of the subscripts 1,2,···,n, it follows that e(xσ(1),xσ(2),···,xσ(n)) =
e(x1,x2,···,xn).With the aid of the independence of X(k), it follows that
R+(k) =/producttextk−1
j=0(1+w(j)µ)andR−(k) =/producttextk−1
j=0(1−w(j)µ).
Lemma 3.2. Fixm≥1.Letα∈(0,1)andw(k)∈ W for
allk,R+(k)andR−(k)for stage k= 2m+1satisﬁes
R+(k) = 1+m/summationdisplay

R−(k) = 1−m/summationdisplay

j=1e2j(k)µ2j.
On the other hand, for k= 2m,R+(k)andR−(k)satisﬁes
R+(k) = 1+m−1/summationdisplay
j=0e2j+1(k)µ2j+1+m/summationdisplay
j=1e2j(k)µ2j;
R−(k) = 1−m−1/summationdisplay

j=1e2j(k)µ2j.
Proof. We use a shorthand notation wjforw(j)in the proof.
Fixm≥1. Now for the case k= 2m+1, which is an odd
number,R+(k)is given by
R+(k) =k−1/productdisplay
j=0(1+wjµ)
= (1+w0µ)(1+w1µ)···(1+wk−1µ)

j=1ej(k)µj
= 1+m/summationdisplay
j=0e2j+1(k)µ2j+1+m/summationdisplay
j=1e2j(k)µ2j,
where the last equality separates terms into odd and even cas es.
Likewise, R−(k)fork= 2m+1is
R−(k) =k−1/productdisplay
j=0(1−wjµ)

j=0e2j+1(k)µ2j+1+m/summationdisplay
j=1e2j(k)µ2j.
On the other hand, for the even number case k= 2m, with an
almost identical argument, it is readily veriﬁed that R+(k) =

complete.

Proceed a proof by induction. If k= 2, which corresponds
toe2(2) =w(0)w(1).Since we are assuming that at least
two weights are strictly positive, in this case, it correspo nds
tow(0),w(1)>0. Therefore, e2(2)>0.Next, assuming
thate2(k)>0for at least two weights w(i),w(j)>0for
somei,j∈ {0,1,...,k−1}, we must show e2(k+1)>0.

Theorem 3.4 (RPE with Time-Varying Weights) .LetV0>
0. Consider a double linear policy with α∈(0,1)and
weightsw(k)∈ W for allk. Then, the expected cumulative
gain-loss function is given by
G(α,w,k,µ) =V0/parenleftbig
αR+(k)+(1−α)R−(k)−1/parenrightbig
.
Moreover, when α= 1/2andw(k)∈ W with at least
two weights being strictly positive, the RPE property holds ;
i.e.,G(α,w,k,µ)>0fork >1and allµ/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Proof. To calculate the expected cumulative gain-loss func-
tion, we use the fact that per-period returns X(k)are inde-
pendent with common mean E[X(k)] =µfor allk. Thus, it
is readily veriﬁed that
G(α,w,k,µ) =E[V0(αR+(k)+(1−α)R−(k)−1)]
=V0(αE[R+(k)]+(1−α)E[R−(k)]−1)
=V0/parenleftbig
αR+(k)+(1−α)R−(k)−1/parenrightbig
,
which is identical to the desired equality in the statement o f the
theorem. To complete the proof, we now show that the RPE
property holds. Fix k >1. Consider two cases by splitting k
into odd and even numbers. We begin by considering k=
2m+1withm≥1, corresponding to an odd number. Then,
using Lemma 3.2for the odd case, we have
G(α,w,k,µ)
=V0/parenleftbigg
α/parenleftBig

(2α−1)µm/summationdisplay
j=0e2j+1(k)µ2j+m/summationdisplay
j=1e2j(k)µ2j/parenrightbigg
.Sincew(k)∈ W , we have ej(k)≥0for alljandk.
Hence, it follows that e2j+1(k)µ2j≥0ande2j(k)µ2j≥0.
In addition, for α= 1/2, the expected cumulative gain-loss
function becomes
G(α,w,k,µ) =V0m/summationdisplay
j=1e2j(k)µ2j
=V0
e2(k)µ2+m/summationdisplay
j=2e2j(k)µ2j
.
SinceV0>0,µ/\e}atio\slash= 0 and at least two weights are strictly
positivew(i),w(j)>0for some i,jwithi/\e}atio\slash=j, Lemma 3.3
indicates that e2(k)>0. It follows that G(α,w,k,µ)>0. On
the other hand, consider the case k= 2m, which is an even
number. Using the second part of Lemma 3.2, we obtain
G(α,w,k,µ) =V0/parenleftbigg
(2α−1)µm−1/summationdisplay
j=0e2j+1(k)µ2j+m/summationdisplay
j=1e2j(k)µ2j/parenrightbigg
.
A similar argument can be made for showing that e2j(k)µ2j≥
0for alljandk. Hence, taking α= 1/2, using the fact that
at least two weights are strictly positive, and Lemma 3.3, we
again have G(α,w,k,µ)>0whenµ/\e}atio\slash= 0, which completes
the proof.
Remark 3.5. (i). Theorem 3.4can be viewed as an extension
of the existing RPE result using double linear policy with
constant weights stated in [ 14]. That is, by taking w(k) :=w
for allk, one readily obtains
G(α,w,k,µ) =V0/parenleftbig
α(1+wµ)k+(1−α)(1−wµ)k−1/parenrightbig
.
Ifα= 1/2andw∈ W \ { 0}, the desired strict positivity
holds; i.e., G(α,w,k,µ)>0forµ/\e}atio\slash= 0 and allk.(ii). Ac-
cording to Theorem 3.4, it is readily veriﬁed that the expected
cumulative gain-loss function satisﬁes G(α,w,k,µ)>0for
allkifsgn((2α−1)µ)>0.
Lemma 3.6 (Variance of the Gain-Loss Function) .LetV0>0.
Consider a double linear policy with α∈(0,1)and weights
w(k)∈ W for allkthen the variance of the cumulative gain-
loss function is given by
var(G(α,w,k,X))

j=0(1+w(j)µ)2−(1−α)2k−1/productdisplay
j=0(1−w(j)µ)2/parenrightBigg
.
Proof. The proof is based on straightforward calculation on
var(G(α,w,k,X)) =E[G2(α,w,k,X)]−G2(α,w,k,µ). Weﬁrst calculate the second moment of the gain-loss function:
With the aid of the independence of X(k), a lengthy but
straightforward calculation leads to
E[G2(α,w,k,X)]
=V2

.(2)
Then we calculate the square of the expected cumulative gain -
loss function. That is,
G2(α,w,k,µ)

.(3)
In combination with Equations ( 2) and ( 3), a lengthy but
straightforward calculation again leads to the desired exp res-
sion for the variance of the gain-loss function.
Remark 3.7. Ifw(k) :=wfor allk, Lemma 3.6reduces to
the variance expression obtained in [ 14, Lemma 3.1].
IV. I LLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES
This section illustrates the robustness of the double linea r
policy with time-varying weights using various examples.
Example 4.1 (GBM with Jumps) .We now collect historical
daily prices for Apple Inc. (Ticker: AAPL) over a one-
year period from January 2022 to December 2022.5Having
estimated the volatility σ∗, we simulate the associated GBM
prices with jumps, see [ 17], using Monte Carlo simulations.
That is, for t∈[0,T], we generate the price governed by the
following stochastic differential equation:
St=S0exp/parenleftbigg/parenleftbigg

2σ∗2/parenrightbigg
t+σ∗Wt/parenrightbigg
(1−δ)Nt,(4)
whereWt:={W(t) :t≥0}is a standard Wiener process, µ∗
is the drift constant, σ∗is the volatility constant, Nt={N(t) :
t≥0}is a Poisson process with P(Nt=k) =(λt)k

random jump.6
To simulate the price, we discretize the process ( 4) by taking
a time period length of ∆t:= 1/252 andT= 1 for one
year with an annualized drift rate µ∗∈(−1,1), annualized
volatility computed from historical data σAAPL≈35.63%,
jump intensity λ= 0.2with a jump size δ= 0.1. With initial
account value V0= 1, we consider four admissible weighting
functions deﬁned by wi:{0,1,...,N= 252} → W ⊆ R
fori∈ {0,1,2,3}with
w0(k) := 0.8;
w1(k) := log/parenleftbigg
1+k
N(e−1)/parenrightbigg
;
w2(k) :=1
2/parenleftbigg
sin/parenleftbigg1
0.02
Nk−0.01/parenrightbigg
+1/parenrightbigg
;
w3(k) :=f(k)sin/parenleftbigg1
f(k)/parenrightbigg
1{f(k)sin(1
f(k))≥0}(k),
wheref(k) := (4
Nk−2)and1A(x)is an indicator function
satisfying 1A(x) = 1 forx∈Aand zero otherwise.
The four weighting functions above represent different
investment philosophies. For example, w0(k)represents a
constant buy-and-hold strategy, w1(k)represents an increasing
investing strategy over the speciﬁed period, w2(k)corresponds
to a more active trading approach, and w3(k)represents invest-
ing more at the beginning and end of the period, with little or
no investment in the middle. Consistent with the simulation s
conducted in [ 14], we generate 10,000 GBM sample paths
for each µ∗and various α∈ {0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9}. Then
we calculate the average cumulative gain-loss; see Figure 1.
Forα= 0.5, the positive expectation gain is seen for all four
weighting functions.
Example 4.2 (Minute-by-Minute Case) .In this example,
we study the performance of the double linear policy us-
ing relatively high-frequency minute-by-minute price dat a for
Twitter Inc. (Ticker: TWTR) between May 4, 2022, and
May 19, 2022.7The price trajectory for the speciﬁc period
is shown in Figure 2. The ﬁgure also includes a subplot
with a magniﬁed view for the interval k∈[50,100] minutes,
featuring various moving average lines, which will be used i n
the next example.
We now examine the trading performance of the double
linear policy using the same four weighting function wi(k)
fori∈ {0,1,2,3}described in Example 4.1. Speciﬁcally,
withα= 1/2and initial account value V0= 1, the corre-
sponding trading gain-loss trajectories are shown in Figur e3.
In contrast to the negative returns obtained by the buy-and-
hold (B&H) long-only strategy with constant weight w0, we
note that all the proposed weighting functions of the double
linear policy assured positive trading gains for the Twitte r data.
6For 252 daily data, the drift rate and volatility constants c an be approxi-
mated by using µ∗≈252µandσ∗≈√
252σ. Whenδ= 0, Equation ( 4)
reduces to GBM. While it is not shown in this paper, the double linear
policy ( 1) assures RPE for the GBM case as well.

temporarily put on hold on May 13, causing a 9.7% decreases in shares at

Table Ialso summarizes another performance metric, such as
variances and Sharpe ratio. It is also worth mentioning that
similar ﬁndings hold for ﬂipped TWTR price data, indicating
the robustness of double linear policy and an ability to capt ure
underlying market dynamics in both bull and bearish markets .

Example 4.3 (Blending Moving Average Indicator) .In this
example, we blend the use of the moving average indicator,
a common method in technical analysis, as a criterion for
designing the weighting function into the double linear pol icy.
This approach enables dynamic adjustment of the investment
based on the indicator. The weighting function used in the
double linear policy ( 1) is deﬁned as
wMAd(k) :=w·1{S(k)>MAd(k)}(k), (5)
wherew∈ W andMAd(k)represent the last d-period average
stock price for d≥1. For example, in the case of minutely
data,MA5(k),MA10(k),MA20(k),MA30(k)represent the
last 5-minute, 10-minute, 20-minute, and 30-minute averag e
stock price, respectively. The investment philosophy is to
invest only when the stock price is higher than the moving
average, which signals a buying opportunity.
Withα= 1/2,V0= 1, andw= 0.8, we summarize the
cumulative gain-loss, variance, and Sharpe ratio in Table II,
and the trading trajectories are shown in Figure 4. From the
table, we see that wMA20leads to the best performance in
terms of the Sharpe ratio. In all cases, we see positive retur ns
using the weighting functions incorporated with the moving
average indicator. Also, while not demonstrated in this pap er,
the MA indicator in Equation ( 5) can be readily replaced by
another technical analysis indicator, such as weighted mov ing
average, moving median, moving average convergence and
divergence (MACD) and so on.

V. C ONCLUDING REMARKS
This paper extends the double linear policy by incorporatin g
time-varying weights in a discrete-time setting. Using a se t ofelementary symmetric polynomials, we prove that the RPE
property is preserved in the extended policy. In addition, w e
derive an explicit expression for the expected cumulative g ain-
loss function and its variance. We conducted extensive Mont e
Carlo simulations using various weighting functions to val idate
our theory. Our results also show that the extended double li n-
ear policy with time-varying weights can be integrated with the
standard technical analysis technique such as moving avera ge.
In future research, it would be interesting to expand our
analysis to a multi-asset case, where the weights can be opti -
mized for a portfolio of assets; see [ 14] for an initial approach.
Additionally, one valuable direction would be to investiga te
the impact of serial-correlated returns on the performance
of the double linear policy with time-varying weights. For
example, an Auto-Regressive (AR) return model might be
worth pursuing. Finally, the impact of transaction costs co uld
be considered to assess the practicality of the proposed pol icy
in real-world applications; see [ 15].
