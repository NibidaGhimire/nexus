Abstract
We present a practical cell-centred volume-of-Ô¨Çuid method developed within a pure Eulerian setting for the simula-
tion of compressible solid-Ô¨Çuid problems. The method builds on a previously published di use-interface Godunov-
type scheme through the addition of a specialised mixed-cell update that is capable of maintaining sharp interfaces
indeÔ¨Ånitely. The mixed-cell update is local and may be viewed as an interface-sharpening extension to the underly-
ing di use-interface scheme along the lines of other techniques such as Tangent of Hyperbola INterface Capturing
(THINC), and hence the method can be straightforwardly extended to include other coupled physics. We validate the
method on a range of challenging test problems including a collapsing metal shell, cylinder impacts and the three-
dimensional simulation of a buried explosive charge. Finally we demonstrate the robustness of the method, and its
use in a multi-physics context, by modelling the BRL 105mm unconÔ¨Åned shaped charge with reactive high-explosive
burn and rate-sensitive plasticity.

1. Introduction
Accurate and robust computational methods for the treatment of dynamic problems involving multiple solid and Ô¨Çuid
materials are vital across many scientiÔ¨Åc and engineering disciplines. Applications include auto-mobile crashworthi-
ness, sheet metal forming, inertial conÔ¨Ånement fusion, asteroid impacts and supernova core-collapse to name but a
few. Such problems frequently involve large deformations which cannot be treated by purely Lagrangian methods due
to mesh tangling, and so evolving the interfaces between materials explicitly becomes a necessary part of any viable
numerical approach.
Many approaches have been developed to tackle this problem. Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods are
designed to avoid mesh tangling by decoupling the motion of the computational mesh from the motion of the material.
ALE codes are often implemented using a Lagrange-plus-remap approach where the mesh motion is formulated as
an operator-split advection step appended to a pure Lagrangian update, but direct ALE is also possible [10, 4]. Fixed
grid Eulerian methods on the other hand have many attractive characteristics, chief amongst them being the complete
avoidance of all mesh-tangling related issues which can hamper robustness. Historically, many multi-material Eulerian
methods have been developed based on solving hypoelastic systems on staggered grids, with explicit artiÔ¨Åcial viscosity
terms to resolve shocks (see [10] for a review of such methods). In more recent years numerous Godunov-type
methods, originally developed for compressible Ô¨Çuid Ô¨Çow, have been extended to solid dynamics using hyperelastic
models [42, 36, 37, 31, 51, 8, 7, 18, 32, 5]. Godunov methods use the solution of Riemann problems to deÔ¨Åne
numerical Ô¨Çuxes and introduce the required artiÔ¨Åcial viscosity implicitly. A distinct advantage of these pure Eulerian
cell-centred methods is their amenability to implementation within adaptive mesh reÔ¨Ånement (AMR) frameworks,
which is often essential to render complex multi-physics problems computationally tractable. The foremost challenge

¬©British Crown Owned Copyright 2023 /AWE 1arXiv:2304.11951v1  [physics.comp-ph]  24 Apr 2023of integrating these methods into numerical schemes suitable for simulating multi-material problems is the treatment
of material interfaces, which form internal boundaries.
Methods for treating material interfaces can be broadly divided into two categories: interface-tracking and
interface-capturing (analogously to methods for handling shocks). Interface-tracking methods use an indicator func-
tion that denotes the location of the interface, such as the zero contour of a level-set [40]. V olume-of-Ô¨Çuid methods
are another notable example, where the fraction of each material present in each cell is tracked and used to reconstruct
an approximation of the interface [19, 41]. Cut cells may be discretised directly as polyhedra within a Ô¨Ånite-volume
or Ô¨Ånite-element framework [37, 9], but this is complex and requires special treatments in order to avoid impractically
small allowable timesteps. Alternatively, some approximate treatment may be used to evolve the solution around the
interface, based on the true jump conditions. Examples include ghost-Ô¨Çuid methods, pioneered by Fedkiw et al. [17],
where the state in each material is extrapolated across the interface (either by solution of the Riemann problem or
some other method) allowing the use of an unmodiÔ¨Åed single-material update, which, by virtue of the manipulated
states near the interface, captures the required interface boundary conditions [18, 6, 45, 32, 35]. A variety of closure
models have been developed for performing Lagrangian updates in cut cells, typically based on asserting some kind
of equilibrium between materials [46, 3, 24].
Interface-capturing methods di er in that the location of the interface is implicit in the solution. The update
applied is the same irrespective of the number of materials present in each cell. The downside of this approach is
that the interface tends to become smeared over time unless some sharpening procedure is used, hence these methods
may also be referred to as di use-interface methods in contrast to the sharp (physical) interface usually o ered by
interface-tracking. A recent review can be found in [33]. Many di use-interface methods have been developed for
multi-Ô¨Çuid systems [1, 44], but relatively few for solid-Ô¨Çuid interactions [16, 15, 5], principally because obtaining a
consistent representation of the thermodynamic state in the mixture region is challenging due to the great variation in
material properties.
This paper is devoted to the development of a Godunov-type sharp-interface method that may be viewed as a hy-
brid of interface-capturing and interface-tracking methods. Our method is based on the di use-interface scheme
presented by Barton [5], which is itself a development of the Ô¨Åve-equation multi-Ô¨Çuid model presented by Al-
laire et al. [1] to include material strength. We design a specialised update procedure inspired by the multi-Ô¨Çuid
methods of Miller and Puckett [38], and Cutforth et al. [12] for cells that contain more than one material, which
preserves the sharp character of interfaces by means of volume-of-Ô¨Çuid advection. The solution within these cells is
derived from the Riemann problem posed in terms of the underlying di use-interface model, and a pressure relaxation
step is included to force the solution to converge to this model. Our mixed-cell update may be viewed as an alter-
native to other interface sharpening methods such as Tangent of Hyperbola INterface Capturing (THINC) [60, 49]
(previously applied to this problem by Barton [5]) and other anti-di usion schemes [48, 50, 25]. The method is prac-
tical (not requiring any complicated geometric considerations), robust (capable of treating multiple solids and Ô¨Çuids
undergoing extreme deformation), and extensible (amenable to the addition of coupled physics).
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we lay out the theoretical underpinnings of
the method, including the evolution equations and the thermodynamic and kinematic framework. In Section 3 we
describe the numerical method in detail. In Section 4 we validate the method through application to a strenuous series
of problems culminating in the simulation of an explosive charge buried in clay. Finally in Section 5 we show the
potential of our method by using it to model the BRL 105mm unconÔ¨Åned shaped charge, an extremely challenging
multi-physics problem featuring reactive high-explosive burn and rate-sensitive elasto-plastic solid dynamics. We
conclude the work in Section 6.
2. Governing theory
2.1. Evolution equations‚Äîderivation
The sharp-interface method is presented as an extension to the di use-interface method of Barton [5]. Under this
model, materials are allowed to mix at their interfaces. Each material lis described by its mass density l, volume-
fractionland speciÔ¨Åc internal energy El. The model assumes mechanical equilibrium: materials in a mixture share
a common velocity uand mixture stress tensor . The basic conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy
are then as follows

In contrast to the model from Barton [5] which uses simple advection equations for volume-fraction, here we use
the volume-fraction evolution equation from [38, 31, 12] which is derived directly from the continuity equation (1)
and therefore takes account of the relative compressibility of each material due to the divergence of the velocity Ô¨Åeld.

If we assume that any compression that takes place is isentropic, and that isotropic stress is maintained during the
advection process, then the pressure change in each material will be equal to the pressure change of the mixture. Then
we can use the deÔ¨Ånition of the isentropic bulk modulus KSBp{B|Sto replace references to the partial densities

volume-fraction evolution appear consistent with the internal energy evolution described later, and found no signiÔ¨Åcant di erence in the perfor-
mance of the method.

It is sometimes necessary to evolve additional history variables to support the closure models, For instance equiv-

For the interested reader, further examples of how multi-physics can be introduced into the model in this way include
the treatment of reactive mixtures in [55], continuum damage mechanics and fracture in [56], and phase transitions
in [59].
Finally, around material interfaces we require an additional set of equations to evolve the partial internal energies
of each material. In [38] an internal energy evolution equation was proposed which added a pdvwork term to the
right-hand-side of the conservative advection equation, inspired by the right-hand-side of the volume-fraction equation
(10). Here we propose an alternative formulation which is equally self-consistent, but which uses the mixture rules to
determine the additional source terms, including those taking account of material strength. By expanding the energy
equation (3) into internal and kinetic contributions we obtain

3. Numerical method
We leverage the AMReX block-structured adaptive mesh reÔ¨Ånement framework in our implementation [14]. AMReX
has native support for advanced architectures such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) which have the potential to
dramatically accelerate calculations. All of the 2D and 3D simulations presented later in this work are performed on
NVIDIA A100 GPUs.
Solutions are found using structured computational grids consisting of hexahedral cells with cell centres denoted
by the indices i;j;k. Each cell Ci jkhas the dimensions xixi 1{2xi1{2,yjyj 1{2yj1{2,zk

cell corners is accounted for, and also greatly simpliÔ¨Åes the volume-of-Ô¨Çuid advection. A timestep thus consists of x,

where Fk;i1{2are the cell-wall numerical Ô¨Çuxes to be deÔ¨Åned later. The volume-of-Ô¨Çuid method is incoporated into
the dimensionally split part of the update, described in detail below.
The basic procedure may be outlined as follows:
1. For each coordinate direction:
¬©British Crown Owned Copyright 2023 /AWE 9(a) Perform MUSCL reconstruction of the primitive variables and extrapolate to the half-time-step according
to the MUSCL-Hancock method.
(b) Use the HLLD Riemann solver [32, 5] to compute interfacial states and numerical Ô¨Çuxes at all faces.
(c) Reconstruct material interfaces using the initial volume-fraction Ô¨Åeld and use the interfacial speeds from
step 1b to compute the volume of each material transported across each face.

2. Calculate the operator-split source terms. Reinstate the symmetry property for the unimodular elastic left stretch
tensor.
For clarity we describe the update in the x-direction, modiÔ¨Åcations for the y- and z-directions are trivial.
3.1. Reconstruction
In order to obtain second-order accuracy in smooth single-material regions, we use the MUSCL-Hancock method [53],
wherein the input data for the Riemann problems is computed by performing a limited MUSCL reconstruction of the
initial cell average states, and then extrapolating the reconstructed states forward in time to the half-step t t{2.
These states are then used to compute the numerical Ô¨Çuxes. The method can be applied to either the conserved or
primitive variables, but testing has shown that reconstruction of the primitive variables yields better results, with fewer
oscillations in the vicinity of material interfaces. This is in line with the Ô¨Åndings of Johnsen and Colonius [22].
The reconstruction is carried out as follows. Given the piecewise constant vector of primitive variables Win each
cell, the MUSCL method constructs a piecewise linear function from which the left and right boundary values can be
written

We note that in [5] material interfaces were sharpened following MUSCL reconstruction using the algebraic
Tangent of Hyperbola INterface Capturing (THINC) technique from Xiao et al. [60], but that this is unnecessary in our
scheme as the interfaces are always conÔ¨Åned to a single cell by virtue of the specialised mixed-cell update. However
it may still be advantageous to apply the THINC technique to Ô¨Åelds other than the material volume-fractions. For
example, Wallis et al. [56] use THINC to sharpen the material damage Ô¨Åeld used for Continuum Damage Modelling
(CDM).

3.3. Interface reconstruction
Material interfaces are reconstructed using the method of Youngs [61, 41]. In each cell, and for each material, the
gradient of the volume fraction Ô¨Åeld is approximated using Ô¨Ånite di erences and an outward-facing normal vector is
calculated
nlrl
|rl|(74)
An oriented plane associated with this normal is then positioned such that it cuts the cell producing the required
volume fraction. This plane is taken as a linear approximation of the interface within the cell. In cells with two
materials, the second material interface is simply the Ô¨Årst with the sign of the normal vector reversed. In cells with
three or more materials, producing an accurate reconstruction is more complicated and has been studied by many
authors [11, 26, 47]. This problem is outside the scope of the current work, and we adopt a simple approach. The
user of the code speciÔ¨Åes a global ordering of materials, and interfaces are computed between adjacent pairs in this
ordering using a cumulative sum of the individual volume fraction Ô¨Åelds. For instance, with four materials, we would
compute the interface of material one using 1, material two using 1 2and material three using 1 2 3. The
interface of material four would be the same as material three with the normal sign reversed.
Once we have the required material interfaces deÔ¨Åned, we require the signed transported volumes of each mate-
rial across the left and right faces of the cell (in the sweep direction), Vl
i1{2andVl
i 1{2respectively. These are
computed as the intersection of the material polyhedra underneath the interfaces and the cuboidal region traced out by
the motion of the continuum normal to and through the cell face by a distance t uint, with sign equivalent to uint. In
thex-direction this cuboid has the signed volume yzt uint, and the sum of the transported volumes¬∞
lVlmust
exactly equal this value at each face. A 2D illustration of this process is given in Figure 2.

two materials. The hatched regions denote the advected volumes, with widths given in terms of the interfacial speeds. The transported material
volumes consist of the intersection of these regions with each material.
3.4. Mixed-cell update
The specialised mixed-cell update must be applied in all cells containing more than one material, but additionally in
cells that could become mixed following the update. In practice this means all pure cells that are adjacent to a mixed-
cell in the direction of the sweep, or two adjacent pure cells containing di erent materials (in the case where the
material interface coincides exactly with the adjoining face). Even in the most demanding multi-material calculations
this will typically be less than 10% of the total cell count, so the computational burden of this process is small.
Following interface reconstruction, the intermediate volume fractions (neglecting contributions from the right-
hand side of (10)) are computed using volume-of-Ô¨Çuid advection

Following application of (75), the sum of the volume fractions Àúlin the cell may not equal one (whenever the
velocity divergence is non-zero). The di erence (1¬∞
mÀúm) must be redistributed amongst the materials in the cell
in accordance with their relative compressibility. To compute the right-hand side of (10) we require the bulk modulus

The mass, momentum and energy transported across the face of each mixed-cell are computed using upwinding.

a wide hat pq) are calculated at the left and right faces of the cell as in (77) and (78) respectively. We also require the

The momentum update (84) is importantly not the same as the one from [38], which used the interfacial velocity rather
than the upwinded velocity in the advective terms. We found the original to be highly unstable when a dense material
is leaving a cell containing a light material, as the dense material‚Äôs contribution to the momentum is not correctly set
to zero. This resulted in large spikes in velocity which caused calculations to fail. The new update does not exhibit
these problems.

Cutforth et al. presented an energy update which reportedly improved robustness signiÔ¨Åcantly in complex simula-

In order to ensure a consistent evaluation of the stress, the same logic is applied when chosing the time-level of the
shear modulus Gl;and the deviatoric strain dev pHeq.
In the case of compression the update may be readily evaluated. In the implicit case (expansion), we invoke the
equation of state (11) to rearrange the right-hand side

ref,pl;n 1
refandGl;n 1are all assumed to depend only on l;n 1and
devpHeqn 1.
In the case of other equations of state where a closed-form rearrangement is not possible (for instance reactive
mixtures along the lines of [55], or cavitating liquids along the lines of [59]), a root-Ô¨Ånding procedure may be used to
perform the implicit update.
3.5. Pressure relaxation
After the update mixed-cells will not in general be in pressure equilibrium, which is a requirement of the base di use-
interface method. A pressure relaxation step is therefore included to iteratively adjust volume-fractions and internal
energies until equilibrium is attained. We Ô¨Årst outline the pressure relaxation scheme proposed by Miller and Puckett
in [38], and then describe changes we have made to improve robustness.
The following equations are solved to adjust the component pressures in mixed-cells towards equilibrium in a
controlled manner.

Due to the linearisation implicit in (93), Miller and Puckett enforced a limit on the maximum relative volume change
in a single iteration of the relaxation, viz. |l{l|¬§. When the cell is under compression 0:1, and0:05 in
expansion.
On each iteration, (92) is used to obtain an estimate of the equilibrium pressure, which is then used in (93) to
calculate the amount by which each volume-fraction should change. If any of the values exceed the threshold, all of
them are rescaled (this ensures that they continue to sum to zero)
l√êlmin

Finally the volume-fractions are changed, and a pdvcorrection is made to each partial internal energy
l√êl l(95)
llEl√êllElpl(96)
The process is repeated until each component pressure is within some prescribed tolerance.
We found the above scheme to lack robustness, particularly within solids where tiny changes in volume-fraction
result in relatively large changes in pressure. We observed oscillatory behaviour around the desired equilibrium
point, where the calculated volume-fraction changes would repeatedly overshoot the target pressure, resulting in non-
convergence. In order to address this we modify the threshold adaptively. Each time a sign-change is detected in l
we reduce the threshold value . The threshold is given by
0exppNsignq (97)
where0is the initial threshold value, is a free parameter that controls the rate of fall-o , and Nsignis the number of
iterations in which a sign-change in lhas been detected. We typically take 00:01 and0:1. Unlike Miller
and Puckett we do not distinguish between compression and expansion when applying the threshold.
3.6. Plastic update
The plastic source term is evaluated as detailed by Barton [5]. This update is independent of the volume-of-Ô¨Çuid
method and is performed identically in pure and mixed cells, but is summarised here for completeness. First the
following ordinary di erential equation is solved using the backwards Euler method to evolve the strain invariant for
each material that adheres to a plasticity law

left and copper to the right. The problem is run to time 0 :5s with CFL number 0.1.
Results are presented in Figure 3 for a mesh with 500 cells. The volume-of-Ô¨Çuid method (labelled VOF) is
compared against the base di use-interface method with THINC interface sharpening [5] (labelled DI +THINC) and
the exact solution derived using the method from [8]. Convergence is illustrated in Figure 4, which gives L1-norms
for density and velocity relative to the exact solution.
As expected, away from the material interface the results are equivalent to the di use-interface solution, however
at the contact the ability of the volume-of-Ô¨Çuid scheme to maintain a sharp interface is demonstrated. Barton noted
that THINC contributes to oscillations in the tangential stress and velocity Ô¨Åelds at the interface‚Äîthese are notably
reduced with the new method.

The second test is a solid-Ô¨Çuid Riemann problem, again taken from [8], featuring highly stressed moving aluminium
in contact with quiescent air. This test is used to verify that the volume-of-Ô¨Çuid method can correctly treat an interface
between two materials with radically di erent properties. The initial left and right states are as follows:

The aluminium is assumed to be purely elastic and is governed by the equation of state from [13] with parameters
given in Table 1. The air is governed by an ideal gas equation of state with 1:4. The problem is run to time 0 :6s
with CFL number 0.1.
Results are shown in Figure 5. The exact solution has been computed for the case with vacuum instead of air, but
this makes little di erence to the solution within the metal which is shown. The air supports a right-going shock not
present in the vacuum which can be seen in the normal velocity Ô¨Åeld.
4.3. Shell collapse
The shell collapse problem has been studied by many authors, an early contributor being Verney [54], and is a demand-
ing test of energy conservation and symmetry preservation. This can be seen in solutions obtained using alternative
Eulerian sharp interface treatments such as the ghost-Ô¨Çuid method, where high resolution is typically required to ob-
tain a reasonable solution [6, 32]. In contrast our method exhibits smaller conservation errors and is able to provide
excellent results even on extremely coarse meshes.
A cylindrical aluminium shell is modelled with initial inner radius of 0 :8 cm and initial outer radius 1 :0 cm; the
domain size is r0;1:1s2cm. An initial velocity distribution is applied that causes the shell to collapse incompressibly.
Plastic distortional e ects convert kinetic energy to internal energy, and eventually the shell stops. Howell and Ball
present formulae for the stopping radii [20]. In this case we have a Ô¨Ånal inner radius of 0 :3 cm and a Ô¨Ånal outer
radius of approximately 0 :671 cm. The initial radial velocity is given by 0 :8u0{rwhere u00:437 km s1. The
equation of state parameters for the aluminium are given in Table 1, and ideal plasticity is used with constant yield
stressY0:2976 GPa. The remainder of the domain is Ô¨Ålled with air governed by an ideal gas equation of state
with1:4 and01:225103g cm3. The problem is run to time 30 s with CFL number 0.6. Figure 6 shows
snapshots of velocity magnitude within the shell, and the location of the interface, at t0, 10, 20 and 30 s.
The Ô¨Ånal inner and outer radii are shown as a function of angle in Figure 7a and 7b respectively for a range of
mesh sizes. In all cases it can be seen that the radial error is limited to less than 2%, even on a very coarse mesh with
only 64 cells in each coordinate direction. In contrast, both Barton et al. [6] and Lopez Ortega et al. [32] report errors
in the region of 35% for similarly sized meshes using ghost-Ô¨Çuid methods. At higher (but still moderate) resolutions,
the deviations from radial symmetry are reduced.
Conservation histories for total mass and total energy as shown in Figure 7c and 7d respectively for the same range
of mesh sizes. Although the volume-of-Ô¨Çuid method is not fully conservative, it can be seen that the error in total
mass for this problem is less than a Ô¨Åfth of a percent, and the error for total energy is limited to less than Ô¨Åve percent.
4.4. Cylinder impact
Cylinder impacts provide a strenuous test of elasto-plastic Ô¨Çow and are included here to validate the rate-sensitive
plasticity treatment. A cylinder strikes a rigid anvil (here modelled using a perfectly reÔ¨Çecting boundary) and deforms
plastically, Ô¨Çowing radially outwards until all kinetic energy has been converted to internal energy and the cylinder
stops, with a reduced length. Wilkins and Guinan provide experimental data in [58], and we also compare against
results given by Barton [5] using the underlying di use-interface method.
The initial length of the cylinder is L02:347 cm and the radius is 0 :381 cm. We predict the Ô¨Ånal length Lf
for a range of impact velocities in 2D axisymmetric geometry, using a domain of 1 :252:5 cm and a mesh size of
5121024. The cylinder is aluminium 6061-T6 with parameters given in Table 1. The Johnson-Cook rate-sensitive

4.5. Buried explosive
The buried explosive problem previously studied in [5] is useful to contrast the behaviour of the volume-of-Ô¨Çuid
method against the di use-interface method for problems involving large deformations and interface breakup. A
charge buried in soft clay detonates resulting in ejecta and crater formation.
For 2D axisymmetric simulations the domain is r0;2sr 2;4sm. For full 3D simulations, one quadrant is
modelled, and the domain is r0;2sr 2;2sr 0;2sm. The initial location of the clay /air interface is y0. The
material parameters for the clay are given in Table 1. Rather than using a Ô¨Åxed Gr ¬®uneisen parameter, a power-law
form is used

The clay and air are given an initial pressure of 1 atm. The explosive products are initialised in the cylinder centred at
p0;13:081;0qcm with radius 8 :763 cm and height 5 :842 cm. The phenomenological balloon model is used to model
the explosive products, sharing the equation of state with the air [28]. The initial product density is 1 :63 g cm3, and
the initial speciÔ¨Åc internal energy is 6 :0568 kJ g1. Gravitational and atmospheric e ects are not important over the
short timescales considered and so are not included.
Results for the 2D axisymmetric case are shown in Figure 10. Snapshots of pressure and a numerical Schlieren
of density are shown at t0:3, 1, 1:8 and 3 ms for the volume-of-Ô¨Çuid method and the underlying di use-interface
method with THINC interface sharpening. The function used to deÔ¨Åne the Schlieren plots is from [43]

where we take 8000. At the earlier times, excellent agreement is seen between the two methods in terms of cavity
dimensions and ground shock propagation. At the later times, the crater dimensions agree well and the volume-of-
Ô¨Çuid method shows its strengths by resolving Ô¨Åne-scale turbulent structures resulting from the break up of the lofted
clay, which are suppressed in the di use-interface solution. A zoomed in density Schlieren at the Ô¨Ånal time is shown in
Figure 11a that highlights these details. Closer examination of the log-scale volume-fraction Ô¨Åeld in Figure 11b shows
that the interface does not fully break when using the di use-interface method, instead unphysical thin ligaments with
low but non-zero volume fraction develop.
Results from the 3D simulations are shown in Figure 12 including the contours of the clay /air interface and the
pressure in the ground. Our Ô¨Åndings are analogous to the 2D axisymmetric case, with good agreement between the
two methods on cavity and crater dimensions, as well as ground shock propagation. The 3D volume-of-Ô¨Çuid method
exhibits the same advantages as in 2D, showing excellent Ô¨Ådelity in the break-up of the lofted clay.
5. Application: modelling the BRL 105mm shaped charge

industrial and defence applications. They are also stringent tests of elasto-plastic hydrodynamics methods as they
typically include multiple materials arranged in a complex conÔ¨Åguration and subject to extreme deformation. This
particular shaped charge has been modelled by other authors [57, 3], allowing us to draw useful comparisons. Note
that it is not our intention to Ô¨Åne tune the model to match experiment, only to show that the volume-of-Ô¨Çuid method is
capable of treating this extremely strenuous scenario and producing reasonable results. It is noted that the underlying
diuse-interface method with THINC interface sharpening does not work well for this problem as the thin jet becomes
smeared over a large area.
The 2D axisymmetric domain is r0;6sr 6;40scm, with the origin chosen to be coincident with the inner liner
apex. The geometry of the shaped charge is given in [2], but unfortunately not all pertinent details are speciÔ¨Åed. For
simplicity we omit the tetryl booster pellet and detonator from our model and ignore the rounded apex of the liner.
Our modiÔ¨Åed geometry is shown in Figure 13.
The liner is copper with parameters given in Table 1. The Johnson-Cook rate-sensitive plasticity model is used,
including both work-hardening and thermal-softening e ects, with parameters given in Table 2. The high-explosive
(Comp-B) is treated using the reactive burn model from [55], summarised in Section 2.4. The reactants and products
both obey the JWL equation of state, with parameters given in Table 3. The explosive is assumed to have no strength
hence G0. The parameters for the ignition and growth model are a0:01,b0:222, c0:222, d0:666,

with the Comp-B is 6 :3 kJ g1. The shaped charge is immersed in air governed by an ideal gas equation of state with
1:4 and01:225103g cm3.
All materials are initialised to a pressure of 1 atm, except for a hemispherical booster region centred at the back of
the explosive with radius 1 :439 cm and pressure 27 GPa, used to initiate the detonation. Twenty Ô¨Åve Lagrangian tracer
particles are initially located along the inner surface of the liner, evenly spaced along the z-axis at intervals of 0 :25 cm
starting from z3:0 cm. The time history of the velocity is measured for each tracer particle.

eighteen microseconds. The detonation wave is initiated by the high pressure booster region. Just after t3s the
wave strikes the apex of the liner and pressure begins to build up in that region. At t12s the jet is beginning
to form as the liner turns in and is rapidly accelerated. By t18s the high-explosive is fully burnt and the high
pressure stagnant region can be clearly seen. Figure 14e and 14f show the late-time jet formation at t45 and
60s respectively. The jet reaches a stable speed and begins to thin out due to the velocity gradient along its length.
The jet also has a blunt tip, which is in good agreement with the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian results presented by
Barlow et al. [3], and as they note matches what is typically seen in experiment. Close inspection of the density Ô¨Åeld
reveals fragments of copper breaking o the tip.
Figure 15a shows the time history of the velocity of each Lagrangian tracer particle over the course of the simu-
lation. The inner apex of the liner is accelerated close to the detonation velocity of the Comp-B (7 :98 mms1). By
the end of the simulation the particle velocities have stabilised. Figure 15b shows the slice corresponding to t60s
as a function of the initial z-coordinate of each tracer particle. The experimental results from [2] are overlaid. The
jet velocity is particularly sensitive to the parameters used in the reactive burn model which have not been tuned, but
nevertheless a fairly good match is obtained.
6. Conclusions
We have presented a novel Godunov-type volume-of-Ô¨Çuid method for the simulation of large deformation multi-
material problems featuring elasto-plastic solids and Ô¨Çuids. The method can be viewed as an interface-sharpening
extension to the di use-interface method of Barton [5]. The method is practical, robust and extensible, and has been
shown capable of treating a range of challenging problems with excellent Ô¨Ådelity.
