honest, while in the second case, one of the users is a malicious player.
We demonstrate an increase of the quantum bit error rate around 25%
in the latter case compared to the case of honesty. The protocol has also
been validated for distances from a back-to-back setup to more than 60
km between verifier and prover. The security and robustness of the pro-
tocol has been analysed, demonstrating its completeness, soundness and

1 Introduction
Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) [1] are cryptographic mechanisms where a user
(prover) has to prove to another user (verifier) that the first is aware of a secret,
without revealing the secret itself or any information about it. Zero-knowledge
proofs provide a powerful tool for enhancing online privacy and security in var-
ious domains. Depending on the scope of application, it may be the case that
both the verifier and the prover are aware of the secret before carrying out the
proof or, on the contrary, that only the prover knows the secret.
Depending on the initial setup and the specific needs of the system, a large num-
ber of use cases with ZKP applicability can be defined, among which stand outarXiv:2401.09521v1  [quant-ph]  17 Jan 20242 M.I. García-Cid et al.
authentication systems to prove the identity of an entity or person [2]; privacy-
preserving payments to verify that one party has sufficient funds to make a
payment, without revealing the actual balance or transaction history [3]; or ac-
cess control where users can prove that they have appropriate access to a system
or resource without revealing any additional information [4].
The concept of ZKP was first introduced in 1985 by S. Goldwasser, S. Micali,
and C. Rackoff [1] showing that certain types of problems, such as graph iso-
morphism, could be proven without revealing any additional information beyond
the truth of the statement. Since then, ZKP have advanced rapidly, with new
techniques, protocols, and applications being developed and refined, becoming
an important tool in cryptography. As technologies mature, ZKP are expected
to play an increasingly important role in enhancing privacy and security.
This type of protocols can be conducted through interactive ZKP [1], that is,
those in which both the prover and the verifier are required to be present simul-
taneously during the execution of the proof, as would be the case of the protocol
proposed by Fiat-Shamir [2]. Non-interactive ZKP can also be implemented [5],
as in the case of the Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowl-
edge (zkSNARK) [6], where the verifier can launch the proof when the prover is
absent, thus solving it later.
The migration of this type of concepts to the world of quantum communications
is of special interest for use cases such as the authentication of several users
with access to the same quantum node within a quantum communication in-
frastructure (QCI). It is important to highlight that this type of user-oriented
authentication proposed in this work should not be confused with the authenti-
cation of the classic communication channel in the QCI. The latter could solve
the authentication of the classic channels used during communications, but there
is still a need of guaranteeing the identity of the end user who is on the other
side of the screen in such a way that his data remains private. The previous issue
is addressed in this work. An example could be the use of the same computer by
several doctors in a hospital to upload their patient information into the health
system. When accessing the health system each of the doctor must be authenti-
cated.
Withinthefieldofquantumcryptography,theQuantumKeyDistribution(QKD)
provides secret symmetric keys between two remote parties thanks to the funda-
mental laws of quantum mechanics. The most widely studied and tested QKD
protocol is BB84 [7]. Recently, other quantum-based cryptographic techniques
have been explored, such as quantum digital signatures [8,9] or oblivious transfer
[10], among others.
This work aims to adapt the concepts of classical zero-knowledge proofs to the
field of quantum cryptography, and proposes a new quantum zero-knowledge
proof (QZKP). Currently in the literature there are not many studies on QZKP,
however some proposals and approaches, mainly for increasing the efficiency of
QKD devices, have turned out to be of great interest for the design of the QZKP.
Specifically, in 2005 the floating bases protocol was published [11,12], proposing
an increase of the number of possible bases to be used in QKD protocols in orderTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 3
to achieve a more efficient system, simultaneously increasing the threshold of the
allowed error rate and reducing the information that can be extracted by Eve.
To carry out this scheme, it is required that Bob and Alice have a pre-shared
secret key on which the selection of the bases will depend. Another estrategy to
improve the efficiency of the QKD devices is the one in [13], where the authors
propose a decoy-state protocol for QKD characterized by a biased bases selec-
tion, where signal states are always encoded in basis Z, while decoy signals can
be randomly encoded in basis XorZwith a pre-determined probability. More
recently, in 2018, modifications of BB84 protocol were proposed through the use
of pseudo-random states generated from a pre-shared secret key [14], in order
to achieve higher key rates. The main drawback of the proposed scheme is the
strict requirement of the employment of a perfect single-photon source. The use
of pre-shared keys and the pseudorandom selection of the quantum states are
the main concepts applied for the design of the proposed QZKP.
In this paper, we propose and implement a new interactive QZKP where both
the prover and the verifier possess a shared secret in advance. The proof is based
on purely quantum mechanisms and has been implemented and experimentally
tested on quantum cryptographic devices. The paper is organized as follows:
firstly, the design of the new QZKP in Section 2 is presented; then, the security
of the protocol is analyzed in Section 3. Finally, the experimental setup and the
outcomes are described in Section 4.
2 Quantum zero-knowledge proof
In this paper, we propose an interactive quantum zero-knowledge proof (QZKP),
where both the verifier (Alice) and the prover (Bob) must pre-share a secret s
to correctly validate the proof. In particular, Bob uses a QZKP with Alice to
authenticate himself, as detailed in Figure 1. This is always the case whenever a
QKD channel has been established before. The proof is divided into three stages:
A.Pre-processing stage , when all the information and setup needed to carry
out the QZKP are prepared. The procedures performed in this stage are
purely classical and correspond to steps 1 and 2 of Figure 1;
B.Quantumstage ,inwhichthegeneration,transmissionandmeasurementof
the quantum states will be carried out, permitting to create a raw bit string
in both the transmitter and receiver ends. In this case, quantum processes
are taking place and correspond to steps 3, 4 and 5 of Figure 1;
C.Verification stage , in which the validity or not of the proof is determined
through an estimation of the error rate. To perform this evaluation, classical
tools are used and correspond to steps 6, 7 and 8 of Figure 1.
The pre-processing stage starts with a handshake between Alice and Bob, at
the end of which an identical timestamp t0is generated in both sites. After that,
given a secret sof any length, Alice and Bob apply a Key Derivation Function
(KDF) [15] that permits to derive h1andh2, just giving t0andsas inputs.
This step is carried out by both Alice and Bob simultaneously. The h1andh24 M.I. García-Cid et al.
Fig. 1.Flowchart of the quantum zero-knowledge proof between Alice and Bob. Steps
1 and 2 correspond to the pre-processing stage where the information needed for the
execution of the proof is prepared. Steps 3 to 5 correspond to the quantum stage, where
the quantum states are prepared, sent and measured. In Steps 6 to 8 the verification
of the proof is carried out by the estimation of the quantum bit error rate (QBER). If
both are honest s=s′, otherwise s ̸=s′. KDF means Key Derivation Function; ∆a,b
are raw measurements; δa,bare the results of the post-processing of ∆a,b; ENC means
the encryption of δa,bwith h′
2; and Tvis the verification threshold.
resulting from this operation on Alice are h1∈ {0,1}mandh2∈ {0,1}n, where
the lengths mandn, being n < m, are values to be defined by the players
before executing the protocol. The process is equivalently performed at Bob’s
side, where h′
1∈ {0,1}mandh′
2∈ {0,1}nare computed. In a scenario where
both Alice and Bob are honest players s=s′, otherwise s̸=s′. More details
about the KDF are given in Section 3.2.
Once{h1, h2}and{h′
1, h′
2}have been calculated, the second phase of the
protocol proceeds to generate the quantum bit string. Unlike a conventional
QKD protocol, where the bases and states are randomly selected, here the bases
are determined on Alice side by the bit-values of h1, while a random selection of
states within each basis is performed. Then, Alice sends the stream of quantum
signalstoBob,whowillreceiveandmeasurethemfollowingthebasesdetermined
by the bit-values of h′
1.
When Bob really knows the secret and Alice is an honest verifier, h1=h′
1.
Therefore, when preparing and measuring the quantum states, both will obtain
an almost identical bit string, ∆r
ain Alice’s side and ∆r
bin Bob’s, meaning with
the superindex rthat these are raw strings without any post-processing. The
obtained bit string is almost identical because, despite preparing the states and
measuring them on the same bases, losses occur during their transmission, even
in the absence of any malicious manipulation. If we consider an ideal setup,
characterized by a perfect extinction ration at the receiver, with no errors in the
transmission,neitherinthedevices,andinabsenceofeavesdroppersinterceptingTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 5
the communications, the bit string detected by Bob would be identical to the
generated one by Alice.
Once the transmission and measurement of the quantum states is concluded,
the verification stage begins with a partial sifting process. This process differs
from the standard procedure employed in QKD. In the QZKP, Bob does not
publish the bases on which he has measured, because otherwise he would reveal
theh1value related to the secret, which violates the zero-knowledge principle.
Instead, he simply announces to Alice the time instants in which he detected
a single photon; then, both Alice and Bob selects just these bits from their
respective strings, obtaining a sifted string, ∆s
afor Alice and ∆s
bfor Bob, without
revealing any information. The superindex smeans that these are the sifted
strings.
Then, an error estimation between ∆s
aand∆s
bis performed, to evaluate
the quantum bit error rate (QBER). Typically in QKD, this process is done
by both Alice and Bob publishing the same fragment of key as plain text and
comparing them. Thus, the number of errors obtained in the selected fragment
represents an estimate of the error in the rest of the key. After this comparison,
the published fragment is discarded. In QZKP, it is not possible to directly
publish a clear fragment of ∆s
aor∆s
bbecause it would reveal an information
strongly related to the pre-shared secret s. Instead, the selected fragment of ∆s
b
in Bob, named δbwith length n, is encrypted with h′
2by means of an One-Time
Pad (OTP) procedure, whereby a bit-by-bit XOR is made between δbandh′
2,
obtaining c′=ENC h′
2(δb). Thus, Bob sends c′to Alice who is able to decrypt it
asENC h2(c′) =ENC h2(ENC h′
2(δb)) =δb, ifh2=h′
2. Finally, Alice computes
the QBER estimation between δaandδb. In QZKP, only a rough estimation of
the error rate is needed. Errors are neither corrected, nor is privacy amplification
performed, since a secret symmetric key is not required at the end of the process.
Finally, once the QBER has been estimated, the validity of the proof is
verified: if the QBER exceeds a certain predefined verification threshold, Tv, the
proof will give a negative result; on the other hand, if QBER < T v, the proof
will be positive, proving the identity of Bob. The QZKP must be performed
iteratively Ntimes to guarantee a correct statistical estimate of the QBER.
3 Security proof
3.1 Security assumptions
A set of security assumptions must be taken into account during the execution
of the protocol.
First of all, in the different security analysis of the QKD BB84 protocol [16,17],
a set of assumptions on the adversary are considered that apply equally to the
QZKP. Specifically, it is considered that:
1. any adversary (external or participant) has unlimited computational power,
even with access to a quantum computer;
2. the quantum channel is considered untrusted;6 M.I. García-Cid et al.
3. an external adversary is able to eavesdrop the communication on the classic
channel but not to inject messages or modify the content of the information
since the channel is assumed to be authenticated.
Moreover, a security perimeter for both Alice and Bob nodes must be guaran-
teed, in order to avoid any unauthorized physical access to the hardware; as well,
appropriate cybersecurity measures are needed to ensure that no side-channels
attacks can be performed in both the classical and quantum channels.
3.2 Key-Derivation Function details
Regarding the KDF, they are basic and essential components of current cryp-
tographic systems. Their goal is to take some source of initial keying material
and derive from it one or more cryptographically strong secret keys. Two types
of KDF are defined, according to the standard NIST SP800-56C (r2) [15]:
–One-Step Key Derivation: from a series of inputs, and a secret value, the
cryptographic material is derived.
–Two-Steps Key Derivation: prior to the derivation, a transformation of the
secret is applied.
IntheQZKPproposedhere,aTwo-StepsKeyDerivationfunctionwithacounter
mode is recommended [18]. The general structure has two main phases:
1. Extract phase: the keying material ( s) and a salt value ( t0) are taken as
input and a fixed-length pseudorandom key KINis extracted.
2. Expand phase: the pseudorandom key KINis expanded into several addi-
tional pseudorandom keys ( h1, h2).
Additional input values in the second phase are a label and context, which are
fixed values, and the required output length ( m+n). It is worth noting that,
even though both sources of entropy, (h1, h2)are directly derived from the secret
s, the actual encryption δa⊕h2is between two independent elements, since δa,
even though derived from s, is actually built as a random string of bits and
therefore independent of h2.
3.3 QZKP security analysis
A ZKP has to guarantee completeness, soundness and zero-knowledge. In the
following, the security of the proposed QZKP is demonstrated.
Completeness can be described as: given that both the verifier and the
prover are honest and both know the secret, the prover is able to convince the
verifierthathedoesindeedknowthesecretwithoutrevealingit.Intheabsenceof
maliciousactors,sincebothpartiesareawareofthesecret,theywillgetthesame
bases configuration for states preparation (Alice) or their measurement (Bob).
Therefore, in an ideal scenario without photon losses and electronic noise, the
results of ∆r
aand∆r
bwill be perfectly equivalent. Therefore, the estimate of theTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 7
error would be QBER = 0and Bob can fully convince Alice of the knowledge
of the secret. However, as we will see in Section 4, in a realistic implementation,
transmission losses and additional sources of noise could be present, increasing
the measured the error rate to QBER ̸= 0.
Assuming that the verifier is honest but the prover is malicious and unaware
of the secret, it must be ensured that a dishonest prover is not able to convince
the verifier that he knows the secret, except with a negligible probability, to
prove the soundness of the proof. These malicious attempts are reflected in the
measured QBER, resulting from the execution of the protocol. As proposed by
H.-K. Lo analysis [19], the QBER is given by:
QBER =p2
A,Z·eZ
B+p2
A,X·eX
B
p2
A,Z+p2
A,X=(1−r)2pX
B+r2pZ
B
2 [(1−r)2+r2](1)
Where, 0< r≤1/2is a variable parameter which depends on the value of
the bits in h1;pA,Z= (1−r)pµandpA,X=rpµare Alice’s probabilities of
preparing the states in each basis; eZ
B=pX
B/2 = (1 −pZ
B)/2the error rate for the
case when Alice prepares the state on Zbasis and Bob measures on Xbasis; and
eX
B=pZ
B/2the error rate for the case when Alice prepares the state on Xbasis
and Bob measures on Zbasis. To try to cheat on Alice, Bob can carry out the
following strategy. Given pZ
B= 0.5andr= 1/2, that is, 50%of the signal states
are encoded in the Zbasis and 50%in the Xbasis, since Bob does not know
the value of h1, he will measure the signals randomly. In this way he will guess
correctly 50%of the times in the selected basis and of the other 50%he will
get an uncorrelated result but he will guess correctly the value of the resulting
bit half of the times. In total, he will get 75%of the measurements correct, but
without knowing which elements are wrong and which are correct. This strategy
raises the QBER to 25%without taking physical errors into account. Therefore,
for a Tv<25%the proof would give a negative result, proving the soundness of
the QZKP. This analysis agrees with what is obtained in Eq. (1) by introducing
the parameters.
Finally, if the prover is honest and the verifier a malicious player, the later
learns nothing from the proof, demonstrating zero-knowledge . For this aim,
Alice could try a similar strategy as in the previous scenario, preparing the quan-
tum states using random bases, since she does not know the secret, s. Alice can
also try to extract information from the string fragment δbduring the error es-
timation process. However, she does not know the value of h′
2, and without this
value, it is not possible to correctly decrypt the OTP. If she tries to guess the
value of each bit of c′, the probability of success guessing all the elements will be:
Pguess = 1/2n.Inbothcases,theobtainedQBERwillbehavesimilarlyasbefore.8 M.I. García-Cid et al.
4 Protocol Implementation
4.1 Experimental system
The protocol described in Section 2 has been implemented experimentally ex-
ploiting a pair of discrete-variable (DV) quantum cryptographic devices, already
tested for standard QKD transmission also in a deployed network in coexistence
with classical channels [20]. A schematic of the transmitter and receiver is shown
in Figure 2.
Fig. 2.Schematics of the pair of discrete-variable quantum cryptographic devices.
The DV-QKD prototypes are based on the implementation of the standard
BB84 protocol with polarization encoding and decoy-state method [21]. Alice
andBobexploitafully-automaticsynchronizedarchitecture,thankstousingtwo
different distributed-feedback (DFB) lasers with identical nominal wavelength as
sources for the quantum channel and of the auxiliary channel [22]. The quantum
signal is composed by weak optical pulses with 20nstime duration and 1kHz
repetition rate. The selected wavelength is 1310 nm, useful to avoid Spontaneous
Raman scattering photons generated by co-propagating classical sources in the
C-band. The decoy-state is implemented as signal ( µ), weak decoy-state ( ν) and
vacuum states ( 0), each of them characterized by a pre-determined probability of
occurrence, pµ,pν,p0, respectively. The measured losses of the receiver module
are about 5dB. The proposed scheme has been implemented firstly in a back-to-
back (B2B) scenario, considering two cases: 1) all actors are honest and 2) the
prover is a malicious user who does not know the secret and randomly measures
the quantum states received from the verifier.
After the validation of the QZKP in these first, short-distance experiments,
the distance between Alice and Bob was increased in order to evaluate the im-
pact on the QBER in the honest condition, ensuring that a relevant number
of false positives or false negatives do not occur. For this aim, the QZKP has
been tested in a point-to-point standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) link and its
performance has been measured, in order to estimate the impact of losses on
the QZKP solution. The different distances were emulated by inserting optical
attenuation in a controlled manner. All the intermediate elements were previ-
ously characterized to determine the initial losses introduced by the setup, theseTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 9
being a total of 2.5dB. Taking into account that the losses in a standard optical
fiber are 0.21dB/km, the setup establishes an emulated initial distance between
the devices of 11.9km. Thus, the evaluated propagation distances ranges from
11.9km to 60.6km, covering a link attenuation from 2.5dB to around 13dB.
4.2 Parameter settings
In all the experiments carried out for the honest case, the protocol parameters
have remained constant except for the length of sifted string ∆s
a,b, named L∆,
that were modified to cover string lengths between 256bitand2048 bit. In the
case of the length nofδa,b, the use of 15%of the total of ∆s
a,bwas established
for the QBER estimation. All the values of the parameter settings are collected
in Table 1.

The same approach was applied for the execution of the dishonest case but,
in this case, the protocol was modified in Bob’s side in order to perform random
measurements due to the assumption that he ignores the secret, as explained in
Section 3. For each experiment, we provide in Table 1 the emulated distance in

time the system takes for generating 1bit; the average QBER estimation; and
the standard deviation of the QBER. As we can see in Figure 3, the time needed
for the generation of 1bitshows a logarithmic behaviour when increasing the
losses in the honest case.

4.3 Analysis of results
Comparison between honest and dishonest cases. For each case, the
QZKP procedure has been run for more than 170iterations, as shown in Table
1. The outcomes obtained for the average estimated QBER and the standard
deviation of the results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 4.
When verifier and prover are honest (blue stars), the QBER is far below the
standardsecuritythresholdvalueof 11%[16].Inparticular,themeasuredaverage
QBER shows an error floor of 2.9%, owing to the non-idealities of the system,
as the finite polarization extinction ratio (ER) of the polarization beam splitter
(PBS), limited to 20dB, and the presence of dark counts in the two employed
single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs). On the other hand, in presence of a
dishonest prover (red stars), the QBER increases up to 26.6%, overcoming the
security limit of 11%of the BB84 protocol. The QBER performance is stable in

and dishonest prover, owing to the limited number of bits used for the estimation
of the QBER, which is a 15%ofm; in case of a raw key length of m= 2048bits,
the estimation is performed on n= 307bits. The standard deviations for the
two considered configurations are 0.7%and1.5%, respectively. The stronger
fluctuationinthedishonestcasecomesfromthelimitednumberofdetectionsand

probability for each basis, while the bases sent by Alice are NZ

or false negative condition, permitting to complete the user authentication in all
iterations.
Results over the distance. The measured QBER performance in function of
the experimented additional losses is reported in Figure 5 and in Table 1.
As before, several acquisitions have been measured for each propagation
length, corresponding to several executions of the QZKP. In Figure 5, the av-
erage values of the QBER together with their standard deviations are shown.
The minimum attenuation at 0dBcorresponds to the already described B2B
scenario. As can be seen, as the link losses increase, the QBER increases slightly,
although it is always far below from the security threshold of 11%. As already
explained, a minimum error rate close to 3%is present, owing to the limited
polarization ER generated by the intrinsic properties of the optical devices and12 M.I. García-Cid et al.

by unavoidable misalignments arising before the PBS. An improvement in the
optical components and of the polarization alignment would reduce the QBER
to values less than 1%in the B2B scenario, which would allow us to appreciate
with greater detail the gradual increase in QBER with respect to attenuation.
In addition, it is observed that the greater the losses, the greater the dispersion
of the measured QBER. This is expected due to the limited number of bits used
during the QBER estimation influenced by the reduction of the length of ∆a
when increasing the attenuation of the system, since the measurement time du-
ration required to obtain the established ∆aalso increases. In the B2B scenario,
the generation of 1bittakes an average time of 0.033s, with a QBER deviation
of0.7%corresponding to the full protocol execution, while for 12.7dBthe gen-
eration of 1bittakes an average time of 0.465s, giving a standard deviation of
1.8%.
It is worth to point out that the dishonest case has only be executed in a B2B
setup to demonstrate the impact in the QBER when a malicious prover who
does not know the secret is present during the execution of the QZKP. This
corresponds to the best case scenario for the attacker as there is not additional
transmission losses due to the increase in the distance during the proof.
Comparison between real and estimated QBER. Finally, given that the
QBER used to accept or reject the authentication of a user is an estimate ex-
tracted from a fragment of length nof∆aand∆b, the variation that existsTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 13
between this estimate and actual value of QBER has been evaluated for the
B2B setup and for raw string outcomes from the largest distances: 22.6kmto
60.6km. As reported before, the length of the fragment used to estimate the
experimented QBER is the 15%of the total segment. To obtain the real value of
the QBER, each of the elements of ∆aand∆bhave been compared bit by bit,
obtaining the results showed in Figure 6 - blue down triangles. For its part, the
estimation is carried out over the values of L∆gathered in Table 1, obtaining
the results showed in Figure 6 - red up triangles.
Fig. 6.Comparison of the real QBER of (∆a, ∆b), blue down triangles, versus the
estimated QBER obtained from the fragments (δa, δb), red up triangles, for different
string lengths.
As we can see, the difference between the estimated value and the real one is
less than 1%in the best case at 4.75dB and an underestimation of 25%in the
worst case at 9.24dB, without any negative impact in the authentication test,
a behavior that remains constant for all the lengths of ∆A,Bused.
5 Conclusions
To benefit from the advantages provided by QKD, the design of an end-to-end
secure cryptographic system is required, where the demonstration of the identity
of the two communicating users is one important step to achieve this goal. For
this aim, the proposed QZKP is a tool that allows the authentication of users in
networks that already have a quantum communications infrastructure without14 M.I. García-Cid et al.
disclosing any personal information about the user or his secret. Based on purely
quantum processes the tool provides a quantum-safe authentication mechanism
that, not only adds another layer of security to the entire ecosystem, but is also
easily implementable with the technology available for QKD and more efficient
because it does not require full error correction steps. Regarding the security
of the protocol, the increase in the order of 25%produced in QBER has been
demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally in a back-to-back scenario,
between an honest case, where QBER = (2.9±0.7)%, and an attempt by a
malicious prover to guess the bases associated with the derived h1function from
the secret, where QBER = (26 .6±1.5)%. In addition, the proof is also valid for
long distances, being demonstrated for metropolitan areas ( ≈60km), where the
increase in the QBER is appreciated as well as a greater dispersion of the data.
It is worth to point out that the QZKP has not presented a false positive or
false negative, thus demonstrating the robustness of the proof. The QZKP has
beentestedandguaranteescompleteness,soundnessandzero-knowledge,against
different strategies from a malicious player. Finally, we have demonstrated that,
for lengths of 2048 bit,512bitand256bit, an error estimation using 15%of∆a
and∆b, provides us with a reliable QBER value that can be used to validate or
not the QZKP.
