Abstract: I discuss how the factorization of the invariant trace used to define Chern-
Simons branes in a space-time with a Chern-Simons action for a space-time group intro-
duces new relationships between the coupling constants of the extended objects of diverse
dimensions, and an enhanced gauge invariance for a suitable choice of these coupling con-
stants, owing to an extension of the Inflow mechanism. I also comment on the possible
relevance of these models in fundamental physics.

1 Introduction
Chern-Simons branes where introduced in Ref.[1] as extended objects in Chern-Simons (su-
per)gravity theories [2–8]. The motivations and lines of research weaved in these models
were discussed in the Introduction to my previous Letter [9], with the relevant References
[10–14]. Also references to other works on Chern-Simons branes were given [15–22].
The ultimate goal of this line of research is to formulate a coherent and simple framework
founded on deep physical principles. Wheeler once wrote [23] "Physics must be in the
end law without law. Its undergirding must be a principle of organization which is no
organization at all. In all of mathematics, nothing of this kind more obviously offers itself
than the principle that the boundary of a boundary is zero. That this principle should
pervade physics, as it does – is that the only way that nature has to signal to us a construc-
tion without a plan, a blueprint for physics that is the very epitome of austerity?". Both
Chern-Simons gravities and Chern-Simons branes models embody this principle, but in the
opposite form, "the boundary of the boundary is not zero ", as shown for instance in the
descent equations in Section 2.
Wheeler’s quote [23] continues: "No. A second sign directs the seeker for the plan of exis-
tencestillmoreclearlytoausterity: thequantum. Whatisthethreadthatconnectsmystery
– 1 –numbertwo, thequantum, withpuzzlenumberone, themachineryofexistence?". Quantum
Mechanics fundamental notions [24] are quantum states and phases, and the transforma-
tion theory of unitary operators1(that are themselves non abelian phases). These phases
are directly connected to the Gauge Principle, as Yang [26] has remarked. Chern-Simons
gravities [2–8] are the answer to the question of how to write a theory including gravity as a
gauge system, and Chern-Simons branes models [1, 9] allow to introduce extended objects
in these theories in a gauge invariant and background independent way2.
It was also suggested in Refs.[1, 9] that the structure of the action as a sum of differential
forms of similar characteristics integrated in manifolds of the corresponding dimension cor-
responds to giving physical content to the differential structure of space-time, as General
Relativity gives physical content to its metric structure.
In this article I continue the study of Chern-Simons branes, particularly the consequences of
the factorization, when it occurs, of the invariant trace used to define these theories. These
consequences are new relationships between the coupling constants of extended objects of
diverse dimensions and the space-time, and an enhanced gauge invariance under variations
of just one of the two gauge fields required to define the Transgression forms, for a suitable
choice of the coupling constants. These results are important as they allow to narrow the
set of possible theories.
The plan of this work is as follows: In Section 2 I review the Green-Schwarz and Inflow
anomaly cancellation mechanisms. This review section is necessary because I will reformu-
late these results in the context of Chern-Simons branes. Section 3 reviews the essentials
of Chern-Simons branes, which are the subject of the rest of the article. Section 4 deals
with the relationships between coupling constants that occur if the trace factorizes, and
Section 5 introduces "electric" and "magnetic" charges in that case. Section 6 discussed
the above mentioned enhanced gauge invariance. Section 7 provides concrete examples of
trace factorization. Finally in Section 8, Discussion and Conclusions, I comment on the
present work and outline future lines of research.
2 Review of the Green-Schwarz and Inflow anomaly cancellation mech-
anisms
2.1 Anomalies
The gauge invariant anomaly polynomial3Ω2n+2is a(2n+ 2)-form is related to the Chern-
Simons (2n+ 1)-form by Ω2n+1by
Ω2n+2=dΩ2n+1.
1Observables are given by the phases associated to these transformations, for instance Energy to time
displacements, Momentum to spacial translations and Angular momentum to rotations (see for instance
first footnote in Ch.VI in Ref.[25]).
2This differs from String Theory, where gauge invariance appears in an indirect way, except in the case
of the Heterotic String [27–29], and in the appearance in String Theory of a space-time metric and p-form
fields. In Chern-Simons models the metric is built from certain components of the gauge field identified
as a vielbein and the p-form fields are composite fields given by Chern-Simons forms of the suitable order,
which automatically yields the anomalous gauge transformations required.
3For the topic of Anomalies see Refs.[30–32] and References therein.
– 2 –It can also be written as an invariant trace < something > of the exterior product of n+ 1
curvature (field strength) 2-forms Fas
Ω2n+2=< Fn+1> .
The gauge invariance of the anomaly polynomial δΩ2n+2= 0results from the fact that
for the invariant trace d < something > =< D(something )>, where Dis the covariant
exterior derivative, and the Bianchi identity DF= 0. It implies that the gauge variation of
the Chern-Simons form must be closed, and hence locally exact δΩ2n+1=dΩ1

Zumino-Witten (WZW) 2n-form Ω1

2n.
2.2 The Green-Schwarz mechanism
The anomaly can be cancelled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism [33] if the anomaly poly-
nomial factorizes as the exterior product of two anomaly polynomials4Ω2n+2= Ω p+2Ω2n−p,
with dΩp+2= 0,δΩp+2= 0,dΩ2n−p= 0andδΩ2n−p= 0. Also Ωp+2=dΩp+1,
Ω2n−p=dΩ2n−p−1, where Ωp+1andΩ2n−p−1are the corresponding Chern-Simons forms.
As before, the Chern-Simons and corresponding WZW forms satisfy that locally δΩp+1=
dΩ1
pandδΩ2n−p−1=dΩ1
2n−p−2. It follows that Ω2n+2= Ω p+2Ω2n−p=dΩp+1Ω2n−p=
d[Ωp+1Ω2n−p], because dΩ2n−p= 0. Alternatively Ω2n+2= Ω p+2Ω2n−p= Ω p+2dΩ2n−p−1=
d[Ωp+2Ω2n−p−1]. The anomaly is then given by
δΓ =Z
Ω1
pΩ2n−p=Z
Ωp+2Ω1
2n−p−2,
asd[Ω1
pΩ2n−p] = Ω p+1Ω2n−p, ord[Ωp+2Ω1
2n−p−2] = Ω p+2Ω2n−p−1. The Green-Schwarz
mechanism states that if the theory includes a p-form field Bpwith an anomalous gauge
transformation δBp=−Ω1
pand an additional term in the Lagrangian of the form ∆L=
BpΩ2n−p, so that the action goes from Γinto
Γ→Γ +Z
∆L= Γ +Z
BpΩ2n−p,
then the new action is anomaly free, that is
δ[Γ +Z
∆L] = 0.
Notice that the gauge invariant field strength is not dBp, but
Hp+1=dBp+ Ω p+1.
In the case of String Theory the field Bpand its anomalous gauge transformation do arise
from a perturbative expansion, with the anomalous transformation a one-loop order con-
tribution.
4Through all this work we use a notation where the exterior (wedge) product of differential forms is
implied αp∧βq≡αpβq.
– 3 –2.3 Inflow mechanism
The Inflow mechanism was introduced by Callan and Harvey [34], and was discussed in
Duff, Liu and Minasian [35] and by Witten [36] in the case of five-branes in an eleven
dimensional background space-time. This mechanism is related to, but different from, the
Green-Schwarz mechanism, and it also requires factorization of the invariant trace. Other
relevant works on this matter are Refs.[37–40].
Following Ref.[36], we consider a 5-brane in an eleven dimensional space-time described
by supergravity [41], with action Γ = Γ 11D−SUGRA + Γ 5−brane.The eleven dimensional the-
ory contains a 3-form potential A3and a 4-form field strength F4=dA3. Normally F4
should be closed, that is dF4= 0, yet in presence of a 5-brane it satisfies dF4=δV,
where δVis a delta function in the 5-brane world-volume. For instance, in one dimen-
sion and if Pis the origin, δP=δ(x)dx, satisfyingR
δP= 1anddδP= 0. This is
not different from a fundamental point-like monopole solution in four dimensions, whereR
MF2=g, and Mis a two dimensional manifold enclosing the monopole with magnetic
charge g, therefore instead of the standard Bianchi identity dF2= 0we obtain dF2=gδV,
with Va one dimensional manifold corresponding to the world-line of the monopole, as
the two dimensional manifold Mcan contract indefinitely towards the monopole and
the result is still g5. Witten considers world-volume gravitational anomalies, resulting
from infinitesimal diffeomorphisms in the world-volume of the 5-brane under which the
5-brane action is not invariant, but rather transforms as δΓ5−brane =R
VJ6where J6is
the WZW term associated to that anomaly. In turn, J6is related to the gravitational
Chern-Simons term I7asδI7=dJ6. Then Witten supposes that the eleven dimensional
action receives a correction Γ11D−SUGRA →Γ11D−SUGRA +R
MF4I7, and the new total
action is Γ′= Γ +R
MF4I7. Under diffeomorphisms on the world-volume of the 5-brane
δΓ′=δΓ11D−SUGRA +δΓ5−brane +δR
MF4I7=R
VJ6+δR
MF4I7, asδΓ11D−SUGRA = 0.
ButδR

MdF4J6+boundary term =−R

boundary term =−R
VJ6+boundary term , therefore the world-volume gravitational
anomaly cancels for the modified action, that is δΓ′= 0, assuming the space-time boundary
term vanish.
2.4 Quantization of constants for the five-brane
In ref.[35] quantization conditions and relationships between the constants involved, namely
the 2-brane and 5-brane tensions and the gravitational constant, were discussed, in the case
of eleven dimensional supergravity coupled to branes. I review here these arguments, with
an eye to a reformulation in the case of Chern-Simons branes.

We use here and henceforth, as in Ref.[36], the delta function notation as a useful way to summarize the
relevant relationships at the level of rigor of theoretical physics.

To conclude this section, it is worthwhile to mention that, using anomaly cancellation
and duality arguments, references [35, 36] argue that the Chern-Simons-like part of the
eleven dimensional Lagrangian gets corrected from a term of the schematic form A3F4F4
toA3F4F4+A3X8, with X8an anomaly polynomial given explicitly in [35].
3 Actions for Chern-Simons branes
As in Refs.[1, 9], I consider actions for extended objects (branes) with dynamical variables
given by gauge fields given as differential 1-forms A=AA
µGAdxµvalued on the gauge group
Galgebra with generators GA, with µ= 0, ..., D, with Deven, the embedding coordinates
of each brane Xµ

(d+1)), where ξi
(d+1), with i= 0, ..., d, with deven, are the coordinates
of the dbrane, and the intrinsic metrics defined at the boundaries of the branes γ(d)rs, with
r, s= 0, ..., d−1. It was argued in [9] that only the two-dimensional metric γ(2)rsdoes
appear, as it is a non dynamical auxiliary variable. The space-time in which the branes are
embeddedcanbeconsidereditselfasabrane, andisitselfdescribedbyanactionofthesame

(D+1)≡xµ.
While the branes themselves may or may not have boundaries, the boundaries of the branes
havenoboundary. Theactionsconsidered, introducedinRef.[1], aregivenasasumofterms

branes are embedded6

Some comments on the motivations of these models, as presented in [1, 9] and refer-
ences therein, may be helpful. As mentioned in the Introduction, I regard gauge invariance
as a fundamental aspect of physical law with deep roots on quantum mechanics. The field
strength or curvature Fis the basic covariant object in gauge theory, and in the absence
of a space-time metric the basic invariant objects are given by traces, or contractions with
invariant tensors, of powers of F. These traces must be symmetrized traces, as they are
contracted with the symmetric power of F, and are themselves not suited to be used as ac-
tions, as they are total derivatives locally. What is possible is to use Chern-Simons forms as
actions [2–8] , which do satisfy STr[Fr] =dΩ2r−1. In a series of papers [42–44] we shown
that the replacement of Chern-Simons-forms by their globally defined counterparts, the
well known to mathematicians "Transgression forms", is required to have a well defined ac-
tion principle and finite conserved charges and thermodynamic quantities for Chern-Simons
gravity. Transgression forms do depend on two sets of gauge fields, AandA, instead of just
one set A, as Chern-Simons forms do. If we set A= 0in the Transgression form we obtain
the Chern-Simons form. The role of the second gauge field Awas discussed in [42–44], and
two consistent possibilities were considered: either Ais an inert fixed background (ideally
satisfying the classical equations of motion), or it is a second fully dynamical gauge field.
For the case of Abeing a fixed background we again identified two possibilities, roughly
corresponding to the "background substraction" and to the "counterterms" methods of reg-
ularization.
The way to the introduction of extended objects in [1] was inspired on the definition of
Chern characters as a formal sum of differential forms of different orders STr{exp[iF
2π]}=
1 +ch2[F] +ch4[F] +...= 1−1
(2π)22!STr[F2] +1
(2π)44!STr[F4] +..., which suggested the
corresponding sum of Chern-Simons forms of different orders as a candidate action, to be
integrated over manifolds of the suitable dimension. We felt that these expressions for the
action did embed the concept of giving physical content to the differential structure, and
did provide another justification for the introduction of extended objects in fundamental
physics. Reference [10] suggested to us to use Transgression forms instead of Chern-Simons
forms, as it yields a gauge invariant theory without the need to fix the gauge in the mobile
boundaries of the branes.
Kinetic terms were added at the boundaries of the branes in ref.[1], both of the standard
and Born-Infeld form. That was motivated by the reduction to standard String Theory
models in the pure gauge case, as discussed in that reference. For quite some time I looked
– 6 –for a way to obtain that kinetic term from the natural boundary term of the Transgression
form, perhaps trough a proper choice of A, without having to put it by hand, and I did
not find a simple and natural way to do it. In ref.[9] I concluded that, if the models were
to be pure gauge systems, the world-volume metrics for higher dimensional branes and
the corresponding kinetic terms should vanish, while the world-volume metric for the two
dimensional boundary of the two brane could be kept, as that metric in that case can be
eliminated, and therefore it can be considered as an auxiliary non dynamical field.
It is worthwhile to note that in standard String Theory one starts with the kinetic term,
namelytheNambu-Gotoaction, andtheWZWtermcomesafterwards, throughtherequire-
ment of kappa symmetry for the Superstring. In our approach the Chern-Simons or, in the
pure gauge case, the WZW term comes first, then the kinetic term is added afterwards.
The relative coefficient between the kinetic term and the three dimensional transgression is
fixed, andequalto ±1

of the right and left movers, to bosonization and to the vanishing of the beta function, as
it was discussed in [9]. Before that, in the supersymmetric case, the relative coefficient was
justified in ref.[1] as the one required by kappa symmetry.
Summarizing, in these models we have the auxiliary space Mp+2in which < Fp
2+1>lives,
then the physical world-volume of the p-brane Mp+1≡∂Mp+2, and then the boundary of
the brane Mp≡∂Mp+1, which for 2-branes are strings [9]. These brane boundaries are
assumed to be without boundary themselves.
4 Quantization of constants for Chern-Simons branes
In this Section I show that the quantized constants corresponding to extended objects of
differentdimensionsdosatisfycertainrelationships, ifweassumethatthetracefactorizesas

The standard quantization condition in the constants of the action [9, 46] is a conse-
quence of the fact that the Chern-Simons forms Ω2n+1on a manifold with boundary satisfyR
∂MΩ2n+1=R
MΩ2n+2. If the boundary ∂Mshrinks to zero the probability amplitude

5 Charges
In the case of standard p-form fields, one has a potential Apand its field strength Fp+1
in a D+ 1dimensional space-time, and can define electric and magnetic charges of the
schematic forms qE=R
MD−p−2∗Fp+1andqM=R
Mp+1Fp+1respectively.
In our framework, and in the case in which the trace factorizes as < F(A)n+1>=
C < F (A)p
2+1>I< F(A)n−p
2>II, we can define, if we are considering p-branes coupled
to the gauge field, the "electric" charge qE=R
M2n−p< F(A)n−p
2>IIand the "magnetic"
charge qM=R
Mp+2< F(A)p
2+1>I. These charges are in principle quantized, that is
q=N=integer.
The field configuration satisfy qE=R
M2n−p≡∂M2n−p+1< F(A)n−p
2>II=R
M2n−p+1d <
F(A)n−p
2>II. The last relationship implies d < F (A)n−p
2>II=qEδMp, where Mp≡
∂Mp+1andδMpis a Dirac delta in the coordinates normal to Mp. Notice that the charge
is necessarily singular, as in the absence of any singularity d < Fr>=< D(Fr)>=r <
Fr−1DF > = 0, in virtue of the Bianchi identity.
6 Enhanced gauge invariance for Chern-Simons branes
As shown in Ref.[1], the action of Section 3 is gauge invariant if both gauge fields AandA
have the same gauge transformation, as F,Fand∆A, and hence Ft, are gauge covariant
andγijis invariant in that case. However, under a gauge transformation of only one of
the gauge fields ( δA̸= 0andδA= 0), the actions change by terms at the boundaries of
the branes or the space-time. This is what happens for instance in the pure Chern-Simons
case, where Ais just zero everywhere.
In this Section I show that it is possible to have a gauge invariant action even in the
case that only one of the gauge fields change, if the trace factorizes, by using the inflow
mechanism.
The Transgression satisfies < F(A)n+1>−<F(A)n+1>=dT2n+1(A,A). If the trace
factorizes as < F(A)n+1>=C < F (A)p
2+1>I< F(A)n−p
2>II, where pis an even integer
and< ... > Iand< ... > IIare the traces into which the original trace factorizes, then it
can be shown that8

8We could as well have written a similar expression with the roles of the traces IandIIinterchanged.
– 8 –This expression simplifies notably if we assume F= 0, that is if Ais a background or a
"vacuum"9, in which case it becomes
< F(A)n+1>=CdT(I)
p+1(A,A)< Fn−p
2(A)>II. (6.2)
This imply < F(A)n+1>=d[CT(I)
p+1(A,A)< Fn−p
2(A)>II], because d < F (A)n−p
2>II= 0
in the absence of a p-brane, which in turn means
Z
M2n+2< F(A)n+1>=Z
M2n+1≡∂M2n+2[CT(I)
p+1(A,A)< Fn−p
2(A)>II].(6.3)
While the previous expressions do not hold in the presence of a fundamental p-brane, we
will consider them as the definition of the Transgression if the trace factorizes and F= 0,
that is T2n+1(A,A)≡CT(I)
p+1(A,A)< Fn−p
2(A)>II.
The gauge variation of the transgression is
δT2n+1(A,A) =Cδ[T(I)
p+1(A,A)]< Fn−p
2(A)>II=Cd[Ω1(I)
p(A,A)]< Fn−p

after taking in account that δ < Fn−p
2(A)>II= 0, and introducing the gauged Wess-
Zumino-Witten functional Ω1(I)
p(A,A)associated to the trace I. Integration by parts yields
δT2n+1(A,A) =−CΩ1(I)
p(A,A)d[< Fn−p
2(A)>II] +d[CΩ1(I)
p(A,A)< Fn−p

In the first term of the second member we need that in presence of a fundamental, singular,
p-brane d[< Fn−p

Wewillassumethespace-timeboundarytermvanish, eitherbecauseofthefall-offbehaviour
of the fields or because the space-time has no boundary.
On the other hand, the gauge variation of the p-brane action is
kp+1Z
Mp+1δTp+1=kp+1Z
Mp≡∂Mp+1Ω1(I)
p(A,A).
Comparing both expressions we see that these variations cancel if kp+1=qECk2n+1. This
cancellation only works for one of the possible values of qE, or equivalently the relationship
between the coefficients must be corrected for different charges.
9In pure Chern-Simons theories A= 0andF= 0, but in that case other problems appear, as for instance
not having a well defined action principle [42, 43]. A more suitable background for theories with Anti de
Sitter gauge group is anti de Sitter space-time.
– 9 –What remains is to consider is the variation of the two dimensional kinetic term. We
have δS(Kin )
2 =±k2
2R
M2≡∂M3d2ξ(2)δ[√−γγij<∆Ai∆Aj>]. For this expression to be
invariantitmustbe 0 =δ[√−γγij<∆Ai∆Aj>] =δ[√−γγij]<∆Ai∆Aj>+√−γγijδ[<
∆Ai∆Aj>]. The gauge variation of ∆A, if only Avaries, is δ∆A=δA=Dλ, where λis
the infinitesimal gauge parameter. For the required vanishing of the kinetic term variation
we must assign the auxiliary metric in the world-sheet a transformation such that the above
condition is valid. To see that it is possible, we may for instance use the Weyl invariance
of this term to fix the metric determinant to minus one, in which case the condition is just
δ[γij<∆Ai∆Aj>] = 0. That condition is consistent, even tough gauge transformations
are off-shell, with the equations of motion, that tell us [9] that the auxiliary metric is
γij=<∆Ai∆Aj>.
A dual version of the previous considerations is possible, with the roles of the traces < ... > I
and< ... > IIreversed. In that case instead of a p-brane we have a (2n−p−1)-brane.
7 Concrete examples of trace factorization
Following Ref.[33], in the case of the group SO(n)one has the trace "tr" in the fundamental
representation of dimension nand the trace "Tr" in the adjoint representation. If we
consider the indices a, b, c, d = 1, ..., n, then the field strength in the adjoint representation
isFab,cd=1
2[Facδbd−Fbcδad−Fadδbc+Fbdδac], where the antisymmetric n×nmatrix Fab
isFin the fundamental representation. Taking traces of powers of Fusing this expression
it results, for the first even powers of F10,
TrF2= (n−2)trF2(7.1)
TrF4= (n−8)trF4+ 3 ( trF2)2(7.2)
TrF6= (n−32)trF6+ 15 trF2trF4. (7.3)
We see from these expressions that TrF4factorizes if n= 8and that TrF6factorizes if
n= 32. We can also solve to write the factorization condition in terms of only adjoint
traces as
TrF4=1
12(TrF2)2if n = 8 (7.4)
TrF6=TrF21
48TrF4−1
1440(TrF2)2
if n = 32 (7.5)
For a de Sitter SO(d,1)or Anti de Sitter SO(d−1,2)space-time groups the relation-
ship given above holds, with the Kronecker delta δabreplaced by the Minkowski invariant
tensor ηabwith the suitable signature, that is Fab,cd=1
2[Facηbd−Fbcηad−Fadηbc+Fbdηac].
Raising the indices a, bwe get Fab
cd=1
2[Fa
cδb
d−Fb
cδa
d−Fa
dδb
c+Fb
dδa
c]. Taking traces of
powers of Fin both sides it follows that the relationships between the traces hold for these
groups, and that factorization occurs in the same cases.
The cases n= 8andn= 32are again cases of interest. The case of the AdS group SO(6,2)
10The traces of any odd power of Fvanish, that is TrF2n+1=trF2n+1= 0forn= 0,1, ....
– 10 –corresponds to a seven dimensional (6+1) theory with dual 2-branes, or in the pure gauge
casea5-branebackgroundanddualstrings. Inthiscasethenumberofgeneratorsandthere-
fore gauge fields is exactly the required for the vielbein (7) and spin connection (7×6
2= 21)
of a seven dimensional theory, that is8×7
2= 7 +7×6
2= 28.
The case of the AdS group SO(30,2)corresponds to an eleven dimensional (10+1) theory
with 2-branes and dual 6-branes. In this case the group has32×31
2= 496generators, and
therefore the same number of gauge potentials, of which 11 are identified as the vielbein
and11×10
2= 55as the spin connection. The remaining 430 = 496 −55−11gauge fields
correspond to internal local symmetries. The gauge fields associated to these local internal
symmetries and the vielbein and spin connection do mix under general gauge transforma-
tions.
Writing the actions for these theories is immediate, but to write the explicit solutions for
the extended objects, the corresponding gauge fields, and the background in the static case
is an interesting problem that will be addressed in future work, as are other aspects of these
models.
8 Discussion and Conclusions
TheoriginalmotivationofthisworkareRefs.[35,36],bothfoundationalarticlesonM-theory
[47, 48], and the goal of the present program of research is indeed a non perturbative def-
inition of that theory, as already stated in Ref.[1]. My strategy is to take the wealth of
previous results as suggestions of the existence and properties of that theory, but to rein-
terpret those results in the framework put forward in Refs.[1, 9] and this article. To that
end several further steps must be taken.
We need to consider the fermionic case, introduced in a Supersymmetric way, via a suitable
choice of the supergroup and invariant supertrace. A good candidate supergroup could be
OSp(32,1)or some of its contractions, as it has been suggested in Refs.[1, 12–14, 49], while
the invariant tensor could be the invariant supertrace. The theory we are looking for should
be eleven dimensional, with 2-branes and 5-branes. In Ref.[1] we suggested a possible candi-
date, given by eleven dimensional Chern-Simons supergravity with gauge group OSp(32,1)
and Chern-Simons 2-branes and 6-branes. Our 2-branes are not the standard ones, as they
have the kinetic term located at the boundary, and reduce to 1-branes or strings in the
pure gauge case.Those fundamental branes may give a long wavelength theory similar to
the standard 2-brane. In an eleven dimensional theory we should have 6-branes, and they
have no kinetic term at all11, but the 5-branes of M-theory may be the ones to which they
reduce in the pure gauge case. The background theory is Chern-Simons supergravity in
eleven dimensions, which has been shown [49] to yield a theory remarkable similar to stan-
dard eleven dimensional supergravity [41] in certain limit, plus corrections. It remains to
be found, if possible, a suitable invariant tensor that would exactly yield standard eleven
dimensional supergravity in a limit, plus corrections. A guide in that search may be the
term A3F4F4in the action of that theory, mentioned in Section 2.3, as in our framework
11The lack of a kinetic term implies that no perturbative expansion is possible. That may be the reason
for the often mentioned fact that 5-branes are purely quantum and non perturbative objects.
– 11 –A3should be a Chern-Simons form and F4=C < F2>schematically, and the form of
that term suggest a double factorization of the trace for at least part of the algebra.
The factorization of the trace and the ensuing enhanced gauge invariance should be a cri-
terion to select the right dimension, group and trace. More symmetry means that the true
degrees of freedom of the theory are less than the apparent ones, and a description that is
in essence simpler than it seems12.
Anomaly cancellation arguments should also play a role in selecting the right theory, as they
did in String Theory [33]. At the quantum level the models discussed in this work should
in principle be anomalous, as for instance there would in general be a world sheet Weyl
anomaly for the boundaries of 2-branes/strings, as in standard String Theory, presumably
vanishing in 26 dimensions. Also the chiral bosons introduced by the choice of the relative
coefficient of the two parts of the action of the 2-brane should generate a gravitational
anomaly owing to their coupling to the metric γij13. In theories with fermions one would
expect anomalies associated with the even dimensional boundaries of the branes, and a
much more constrained and intricate pattern of anomaly cancellations, that would severely
restrict viable theories.
I wonder if, in case an anomaly free model is found, the action of that model would not be
itself the quantum effective action [50], receiving no quantum corrections. This conjecture is
motivated by the Adler-Bardeen theorem [51]14, and the fact that the mathematical struc-
ture of our action is just the same than the one of Anomalies. This may seem surprising,
as it is commonly assumed that for interacting theories the quantum effective action must
be non local, but I am not aware of any general result or theorem in that sense15, and also
what seems a non local theory in some dimension may come from a local theory in a higher
dimension, as shown by Kaluza-Klein theories, and wormholes.
Another interesting question has to do with topological quantum phases in these models,
in the line of Refs.[55–58], and the implications of this phases, among other things, for the
statistics.
Finally, Chern-Simons models have no intrinsic scale, but one is introduced in the case of
AdS groups and they supersymmetric generalizations [2–8] by identifying part of the gauge
potentials as the vielbein Aa
µ=1
lea
µ, where lis such constant. I think there is more to be
said and done about that question16.
12That may be a general property of fundamental physical law, in the spirit of Wheeler’s thoughts cited
above, perhaps similar to the concept of Yugenin Japanese aesthetics.
13A chiral scalar could be thought as a p= 0chiral p-form field, which would give [31] an anomaly
polynomial of IA=1
48tr[R2
(2)]for each chiral boson, where R(2)is the curvature associated to the metric
γij.
14See also Ref.[52], Ch.IV.7 for a clear and pedagogical exposition.
15I acknowledge helpful correspondence with Prof. K. Scharnhorst on this matter. Also I found his work,
Refs.[53, 54] relevant on this topic.
16In the same vein of Schrodinger’s cat problem in Quantum Mechanics, we may call this Galileo’s dog
problem, after the classic discussion and drawing on scale invariance not being a symmetry of Nature in
Galileo’s book Discourses and mathematical demonstrations relating to two new Sciences .
