When two solids are separated by a vacuum gap of thickness smaller than the wavelength of
acoustic phonons, the latter can tunnel across the gap thanks to van der Waals forces or elec-
trostatic interactions. Here we show that these mechanical vibration modes can also contribute
signiﬁcantly, at the atomic scale, to the nonlocal radiative response of polar materials. By com-
bining molecular-dynamics simulations with ﬂuctuational-electrodynamics theory we investigate the
near-ﬁeld radiative heat transfer between two slabs due to this opto-mechanical coupling and we

The physics of heat transfer between two solids sep-
arated by a vacuum gap in the transition regime be-
tween conduction and radiation remains today largely
unknown. When solids are separated by gaps having
thicknesses of tens of nanometres or more heat trans-
fer is exclusively driven by photons exchange. In the
far-ﬁeld regime (distances larger than the thermal wave-
length,around10 µmatambienttemperature)thistrans-
fer is limited by Stefan-Boltzmann’s law deﬁning the
blackbody limit [1]. At subwavelength scale and down
to distances of about ten nanometers, the heat ﬂux ex-
changed between the solids can overcome this limit by
several orders of magnitude [2–12] thanks to the tun-
neling of evanescent photons which superimposes to the
ﬂux driven by propagative photons. Below this separa-
tion distance, heat transfer can be mediated by multi-
ple carriers [13–17]. More speciﬁcally, at sub-nanometer
scale, acoustic vibration modes of solids participate in
the transfer. In 2015, Chiloyan et al. highlighted [18], by
means of atomistic simulations, the dominant role played
by these modes on the transfer between polar materials.
In that work, it was claimed that this transfer results
from the tunneling of vibration modes thanks to surface
forces. Such a transfer has been described theoretically
in the continuum limit for isotropic media by Pendry et
al. [19] (see also Refs. [20, 21]) using the classical elastic-
ity theory. More recently this description has been ex-
tended to anisotropic piezoelectric materials [22]. In the
present Letter we show that acoustic vibration modes,
which are traditionally purely mechanical modes in the
long-wavelength (LW) limit, are not only able to tunnel
through the separation gap thanks to the surface forces
existing between the two solids, but also contribute, at
atomic-scale separation distances (i.e. short wavelengths
limit), to the nonlocal radiative response of materials. In
the LW limit, it is well-known that the optical phonons
are the only excitations that give rise to local electric
dipole moments inside the material owing to the motionof neighboring atoms with opposite partial charges in op-
posite directions. In this limit, the optical phonons are
the only link between the atomic vibrations within the
solid and the surrounding electromagnetic ﬁeld. These
optical vibration modes entirely drive the radiative re-
sponse of material. Although a mesoscopic theory de-
scribingthenonlocalresponseofpolarmaterialshasbeen
recently introduced [23] in an analogous way as the hy-
drodynamic description of electron gas in nonlocal plas-
monics [24, 25], this theory suﬀers from a fundamental
limitation to properly describe light-matter interactions
at the atomic scale. Indeed, it ignores the crucial role
played by the acoustic vibration modes in the radia-
tive response of material. However, as we will see, at
atomic scale, acoustic vibration modes play a major role
in this response. Here, we make a detailed description of
thisopto-mechanicalcouplingandwehighlightitsimpor-
tance in the radiative heat exchanges between two solids
close to the physical contact. We demonstrate that, con-
trary to wide belief, these acoustic vibration modes can
signiﬁcantly contribute to the radiative heat exchanges
and can even be dominant, in front of the contribution
coming from optical phonons, in the cryogenic regime.
To start, let us consider a polar material of arbitrary
crystalline structure. To describe light interaction with
thiscrystalintheinfraredfrequencyrangeandatatomic-
scale separation distances, a nonlocal model of the radia-
tive response of the material must be introduced. To go
beyond the Gubbin and De Liberato theory [23] a fully
atomistic calculation of the dielectric response has been
performed(seeSupplementalMaterial[26]andreferences
[27–30] therein), based on the analysis of the ﬂuctuations
ofthepolarizationdensitywithinthecrystal. Inspatially
invariant crystals this density is related to local electric
ﬁeldE(r,t)through the nonlocal relation (assuming the
system stationary)

and/epsilon1mn(k,ω) =χmn(k,ω)+δmn, respectively, δmnbeing
the Kronecker delta. These expressions relate the non-
local radiative response of material to the correlations
functions of local dipolar moments. The latter are in
turn related to the motion of partial charges which are
associated to each atom. In contrast, we deﬁne the localresponse as the limit χmn(k,ω)→χmn(k= 0,ω)valid
for large separation distances. Relation (4) can be gen-
eralized to the quantum regime by relating the correla-
tion function of ﬂuctuating polarization density operator
to the electrical susceptibility through the general Kubo
formula [32].
To give insight into the link between the vibration
modes and the radiative response of material we detail
below the case of the diatomic chain [33] which is the
simplest polar crystal. In this particular case, it is well
known that the dispersion relation of resonant modes

and the amplitudes of optical and acoustic normal modes
satisfy respectively the relations uk/vk≈−M2/M1(i.e.
out-of-phase atomic vibration) and uk/vk≈1(i.e. in-
phase atomic vibration), showing that only the opti-
cal modes give rise to dipole moments. On the other
hand, close to the upper bound of the Brillouin zone (i.e.
k≈π/a), that is in the extreme near-ﬁeld regime, the
situation radically changes. As shown in Fig. 1(a), an
anticrossing of acoustic and optical branches appears in
this zone showing a strong coupling between these modes
with a frequency splitting (assuming here M2< M 1)
Γ =ωo−ωa, withωo=/radicalbig
2C/M 2andωa=/radicalbig
2C/M 1.
As far as the amplitudes of normal modes are concerned,
we see from the general expression (6) that
uk
vk≈iC(ka−π)

so thatuk/vk→0for the optical modes and uk/vk→∞
for the acoustic modes. These relations demonstrate that
both types of modes give rise to dipole moments and
therefore both contribute to the radiative response of the
chain. Moreovertheserelationsalsodemonstratethatfor
both acoustic and optical modes one atom is motionless
in the unit cell while the second is free to oscillate making
these modes identical in nature.
The radiative contribution of acoustic modes to the
nonlocal radiative response can be directly observed in a
concrete scenario. In Fig. 1(b) we show the dielectric re-
sponse of a magnesium oxide (MgO) crystal in the (001)
axis of reciprocal space obtained by molecular-dynamics
simulation [26]. This material has been chosen to get
well-separated optical and acoustic branches making the
analysis and interpretation of results easier. The com-
parison of this mapping with the dispersion relations of
resonant vibration modes [Fig. 1(c)] calculated by solv-
ing the secular equation of the crystal clearly shows the
contribution of optical branches at high frequencies but
also the one of acoustic branches at low frequencies. We
also observe, at the edge of the Brillouin zone, the an-
ticrossing, previously mentioned for the diatomic chain,
between the longitudinal optical (LO) and the longitu-
dinal acoustic (LA) branches, true signature of strong
coupling between these vibration modes in this region.
It is worthwhile to note that the contribution of acoustic
modes is not limited to the edge of the Brillouin zone.
In Fig. 1(b) we see that the acoustic mode can couple
to the electromagnetic ﬁeld relatively far away from this
region. For MgO, the contribution of acoustic modes to
the nonlocal response of crystal can be observed down to
wavectorsk≈1/2a,a= 4.2Å being the lattice constant
of crystal.
The role played by these modes on the radiative heat
transfer can then be investigated thanks to ﬂuctational-
electrodynamics theory. According to this framework,
the conductance of radiative heat exchanged at tem-
peratureTbetween two solids separated by a vacuumgap of thickness dcan be written in the Landauer-like
form [3, 34, 35]

for diﬀerent temperatures at d= 6Å. The conductance is calculated using both the local (red) and nonlocal (red) dielectric
response of material. The dashed curves represent Planck’s law in arbitrary units.
At gapsd>1nm we see that the heat transfer mainly
stems from modes at high frequencies. The compari-
son of spectra with the dielectric permittivity plotted in
Fig. 1 shows that these modes are in the spectral range
of optical phonons. However, below this critical distance
we observe that the lower-frequency modes also partic-
ipate in the transfer. We also note in Fig. 2(b) that
the relative weight of these modes in comparison with
the high-frequency modes increases at low temperature.
These modes even become dominant in the cryogenic
regime (T < 100K). The inspection of the transmis-
sion coeﬃcients plotted in Fig. 3 clearly shows that these
low-frequency modes correspond to acoustic vibration
modes. This result unquestionably demonstrates that
the acoustic modes contribute radiatively to the transfer
at small separation distances. Unlike the conductive-like
heat transfer due to the mechanical tunneling of acoustic
modes mediated by van der Waals forces between the two
solids, this transfer is purely radiative and is related to
dipole-dipole interactions induced by the acoustic vibra-
tionmodes. Also, itmustbenoted(seeFig.1(b))thatthe
acoustic modes with very small wavevector do not play
any role in the radiative response of the material. These
modes can in principle participate to the heat transfer
by tunneling but not to the radiative one. However, as
shown in [18] this tunneling is negligible because of the
weakness of surface forces.
Finally, we analyze the ratio of the nonlocal radiative
conductancetothelocalone. TheresultsplottedinFig.4
with respect to the separation distance for diﬀerent tem-
peratures show, at large distance, that the local and non
local conductances become, as expected, identical. More-

over we note that nonlocal eﬀects dominate at low tem-
perature, in the cryogenic regime owing to the dipoles
generated by the acoustic vibration modes. This result
would be trivial if these modes were known to give rise
to electric dipoles. But this is not generally the case for
small wavevectors. Hence, at relatively large distances5

[see Fig. 2(a)] these modes do not contribute to the
transfer. On the other hand, at close separation distance
(large wavectors), this is not true anymore and these me-
chanical vibration modes contribute signiﬁcantly to the
heat transfer, this contribution being purely radiative in
nature. In the inset of Fig. 4 we see at ambient tem-
perature that the conductance follows the usual power
law scaling in 1/d2,dbeing the separation gap between
the two plates (see [26]). On the the other hand, in the
cryogenic regime the scaling changes since the transfer is
not mediated anymore by the surface phonon-polaritons.

have shown that the acoustic vibration modes play a ma-

principle, be actively tuned at the atomic scale. Future

recent progress in instrumental opto-mechanics [38].

local dielectric function of MgO in the infrared regime [3]. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (1) denotes the long-range Coulomb
interaction between charged ions, whereas the second and third terms are the short-range bonding interaction. A
cut-oﬀ distance of 10 Å is adopted for the short-range interaction, and the particle-particle particle-mesh (pppm)
method is used for treating the long-range Coulomb interaction.
A10×10×10supercell of 8000 atoms is used in EMD simulation with a time step of 0.5 fs. Firstly the system
is equilibrated under a NVT(canonical) ensemble for 1 million steps. Then the system is switched to NVE(micro-
canonical) ensemble for 5 million steps, where the system polarization density is sampled every 20 steps as calculated

ORIGIN OF THE DIPOLAR RESPONSE INDUCED BY THE ACOUSTIC VIBRATION MODES
In Ref. [18] of the main text, the atomistic approach adopted by the authors is general and, in principle, it can be
used to calculate precisely the heat ﬂux exchanged between two polar materials. But the interpretation of physicalarXiv:2302.00520v2  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  23 Nov 20232

results they give in their work is incomplete and even partially wrong. Indeed, the enhancement of heat ﬂux they
observed is attributed to the tunneling of acoustic phonons and not to the dipolar moments induced by these modes.
Here below we detail the physical origin of dipolar moments induced by the acoustic modes in the particular case
of a diatomic chain as sketched in Fig. 1. In the long wavelength limit [Fig. 1(a)] the motion of light and heavy atoms
vibrate in phase opposition for the optical vibration modes and they vibrate in phase for acoustic modes. Hence only
the optical modes give rise to dipole moments and are able to couple with an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. On the
contrary, in the short wavelength limit [Fig. 1(b)] both optical and the acoustic vibration modes give rise to dipole
moment. Inthecaseofopticalmodestheheavyatomsareﬁxedwhilethelightatomsoscillatearoundtheirequilibrium
position while for the acoustic modes the light atoms which are ﬁxed and the heavy atoms oscillate as illustrated
in the bottom of Fig. 1. This constitutes a radical change of paradigm from the state of the art where the acoustic
vibrations modes are usually assumed to be purely mechanical modes and unable to couple to the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. Here we have demonstrated that this vision proves to be wrong in the short wavelength limit. Beside this result,
one of the main advantages of our approach in comparison with the one of Ref. [18] is that we can quantitatively and
qualitatively study the role played by the acoustic and optical modes in the heat transfer.
POWER LAW SCALING OF HEAT TRANSFER VS THE SEPARATION DISTANCE
With polar materials the near-ﬁeld heat transfer between two plates is dominated by TM evanescent waves that can
be shown to stem from surface phonon polaritons. These surface electromagnetic waves are hybrid or cavity modes
that reside in both plates and have a penetration depth that is of the order of the gap size. For a given separation
gapdthe cutoﬀ wavevector is proportional to 1/d[5] leading to a 1/d2dependence of the heat transfer coeﬃcient.
This power law scaling appears clearly on the simulations plotted in Fig. 2. However at cryogenic temperature the
power law scaling changes since the transfer is not mediated anymore by the surface phonon-polariton.
