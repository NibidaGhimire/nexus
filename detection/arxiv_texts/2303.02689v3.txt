Abstract. We show that the parabolic quaternionic Monge-Amp` ere equa tion on a compact
hyperk¨ ahlermanifold has always along-time solution whic h once normalized converges smoothly
to a solution of the quaternionic Monge-Amp` ere equation. T his is the same setting in which
Dinew and Sroka [13] prove the conjecture of Alesker and Verb itsky [3]. We also introduce an
analogue of the Chern-Ricci ﬂow in hyperhermitian manifold s.
1.Introduction
A hypercomplex manifold is a real 4 n-dimensional smooth manifold equipped with three
complex structures I,J,Ksatisfying the quaternionic-type relations IJ=−JI=K. A hy-
perhermitian metric gis determined either by a form Ω of type (2 ,0) with respect to Ior by
a positive real form ωof type (1,1) with respect to Isuch thatJω=−ω. A hyperhermitian
metric is called HKT (hyperk¨ ahler with torsion) if ∂Ω = 0 (the operators ∂and¯∂will be always
taken with respect to the complex structure Ithroughout the paper). HKT metrics were ﬁrst
introduced in [25] with motivations coming from theoretica l physics and further studied from
the purely geometric point of view (see e.g. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 34, 35, 43, 45, 47]
and the references therein).
In hyperhermitian geometry the role of plurisubharmonic fu nctions is usually replaced by
smooth real functions ϕsatisfying Ω + ∂∂Jϕ >0 (quaternionic plurisubharmonic functions),
where the positivity is in the sense of (2,0)-forms (see the p reliminaries) and ∂J=J−1¯∂Jis the
twisted¯∂operator. Equivalently a function ϕis quaternionic plurisubharmonic if ω+i
2(∂¯∂ϕ−
J∂¯∂ϕ) is positive as a (1 ,1)-form.
In [3] Alesker and Verbitsky introduced an analogue of the co mplex Monge-Amp` ere equation
on hyperhermitian manifolds by considering for a given smoo th function fthequaternionic
Monge-Amp` ere equation
(1) (Ω+ ∂∂Jϕ)n= ef+bΩn,Ω+∂∂Jϕ>0,sup
Mϕ= 0,
for a real-valued function ϕand a constant b. The equation can be reformulated in terms of real
2-forms as
(2) (ω+i
2(∂¯∂ϕ−J∂¯∂ϕ))2n= e2(f+b)ω2n, ω+i
2(∂¯∂ϕ−J∂¯∂ϕ)>0,sup
Mϕ= 0.
In [3] it is conjectured that the equation is always solvable on compact HKT manifolds at least
under the extra assumption that the canonical bundle of ( M,I) is holomorphically trivial.
Following the strategy of Yau for proving the Calabi conject ure [46], the natural approach for
studying the quaternionic Monge-Amp` ere equation is via th e continuity method and the hard

part in this direction is, as usual, the proof of a priori esti mates. Fortunately some important
results have been established in this direction. The C0estimate is now proved in the most
general case. A ﬁrst proof of the C0estimate was given in [3] under the assumptions on gto be
HKT and on the canonical bundle of ( M,I) to be holomorphically trivial. Furthermore the C0
estimate was improved in [2] by removing the condition on the canonical bundle and recently
also the HKT assumption was removed by Sroka in [35] applying a recent method of Guo, Phong
and Tong [22, 23, 24]. The higher order estimates have been es tablished so far only under extra
assumptions. In [1] Alesker conﬁrmed the conjecture on comp act ﬂat hyperk¨ ahler manifolds.
More recently Dinew and Sroka drastically improved Alesker ’s result by proving the conjecture
also for non-ﬂat hyperk¨ ahler manifolds [13]. Other partia l conﬁrmations to the conjecture can
be found in [17, 18].
In the present paper we ﬁrst observe that in the most general c ase an upper bound of the
Laplacian of the solution to (1) combined with the C0estimate implies all the other a pri-
ori estimates (Theorem 3.1). In particular this allows us to simplify part of the proof of the
Dinew-Sroka Theorem in [13] (see Remark 3.2). We further pro ve an analogous result for the
quaternionic parabolic Monge-Amp` ere equation

introduced in [6, 47] (see Theorem 3.3). This leads to the fol lowing theorem which we prove in
section 4
Theorem 1.1. Let(M,I,J,K,g )be a compact hyperhermitian manifold. Assume that (I,J,K)
admits a compatible hyperk¨ ahler metric ˆg. Then for every f∈C∞(M)equation (3)has a unique
long-time solution ϕ(t),t∈[0,∞). The normalization

converges to a solution of (1)with a suitable choice of b.
Theorem 1.1 is the natural generalization of the main theore m in [6, 47] and the parabolic
version of the main result in [13].
Given a solution ϕ(t) to (3), the associated (1 ,1)-formω(t) :=ω+i
2(∂¯∂ϕ(t)−J∂¯∂ϕ(t))
satisﬁes the evolution equation
(4) ˙ ω(t) =−1
2(Ric(ω(t))−JRic(ω(t))−β+Jβ)
whereβ= Ric(ω)−2i∂¯∂fandRicistheChern-Ricciformwithrespectto I. Long-timeexistence
and convergence of (3) would imply the fact that for every rep resentative βofcBC
1(M,I), there
is a unique hyperhermitian metric of the form ωϕ=ω+i
2(∂¯∂ϕ−J∂¯∂ϕ) with Ric( ωϕ) =β.
From this point of view Theorem 1.1 is in the spirit of Cao’s th eorem [8].
Equation (4) suggests to consider the geometric ﬂow
(5) ˙ ω(t) =−1
2(Ric(ω(t))−JRic(ω(t))), ω(0) =ω,
since it preserves the compatibility with the hypercomplex structure and plays the role of the
Ricci-ﬂow in K¨ ahler geometry and of the Chern-Ricci ﬂow in H ermitian geometry [41]. We
think that a study of ﬂow (5) in the same spirit of [41] could gi ve new insights in hyperhermitian
geometry. In section 5 we collect some preliminary observat ions on the ﬂow.THE PARABOLIC QUATERNIONIC CALABI-YAU EQUATION ON HYPERK ¨AHLER MANIFOLDS 3

2.Preliminaries
Ahypercomplex manifold (M,I,J,K )isaneven-dimensionalcomplexmanifold( M,I)equipped
with two additional complex structures ( J,K) satisfying the quaternionic-type relations IJ=
−JI=K. A Hermitian metric gon (M,I,J,K ) ishyperhermitian if it is compatible with each
I,J,K. Any hyperhermitian metric ginduces a corresponding form
Ω :=1
2(g(J·,·) +ig(K·,·)) =1
2(ωJ+iωK)∈Λ2,0
I
which satisﬁes the following properties
•Ω(J·,J·) =¯Ω (Ω is q-real);
•Ω(Z,J¯Z)>0 for every non-zero Z∈T1,0M(Ω is positive).
Conversely, any q-real and positive Ω ∈Λ2,0
Iinduces a hyperhermitian metric gvia the relation
(6) g= 2Re(Ω( ·,J·)).
Hence we have a one-to-one correspondence between q-real positive (2 ,0)-forms and hyperher-
mitian metrics. If Ω is ∂-closed we say that gishyperk¨ ahler with torsion (HKT). We further
denote byωthe fundamental form of ( g,I). We have the following relation
(7)Ωn∧¯Ωn
(n!)2=ω2n
(2n)!,
(see e.g. [36, Section 4.3]).
Let∂be the∂-operator with respect to Iand∂J:=J−1¯∂J: Λr,0
I→Λr+1,0
I. Then
∂∂J=−∂J∂,
see [13]. Every Ω ϕ:= Ω+∂∂Jϕ>0 induces a hyperhermitian metric gϕ. We further denote by
ωϕthe (1,1)-form of ( gϕ,I).
The following useful lemma follows from [35, Remark 4.1] and [13, Proposition 2.15] but we
prove for the reader’s convenience
Lemma 2.1. For everyϕ∈C∞(M)we have
∂∂Jϕ(X,Y) =−1
2/parenleftbig
∂¯∂ϕ(X,JY)+∂¯∂ϕ(JX,Y)/parenrightbig2,0.
Moreover,
ωϕ=ω+i∂¯∂ϕ−iJ∂¯∂ϕ
2
and
trgϕg= 2n−∆ϕϕ,
where∆ϕis the Chern-Laplacian operator with respect to gϕ.
Proof.The ﬁrst part of the statement can be easily proved locally by usingI-holomorphic
coordinates such that ∂iJ¯r
s=∂sJ¯r

∂∂Jϕ=−∂J¯∂ϕ=−∂Jϕ¯rd¯zr=−∂(ϕ¯rJ¯r

hence
(8) ∂∂Jϕ(X,Y) =1
2/parenleftbig
−∂¯∂ϕ(X,JY)+∂¯∂ϕ(Y,JX)/parenrightbig2,0
as required. Moreover, from (6) and (8) we have
gϕ(X,Y) = 2Re(Ω ϕ(X,JY)) =g(X,Y)−1
2/parenleftbig
i∂¯∂ϕ(KX,JY)−i∂¯∂ϕ(X,IY)/parenrightbig
and thus
ωϕ(X,Y) =gϕ(IX,Y) =ω(X,Y)−1
2/parenleftbig
i∂¯∂ϕ(JX,JY)−i∂¯∂ϕ(X,Y)/parenrightbig
.
Finally, since gϕisJ-Hermitian we have
trgϕg= trωϕω= 2n−trωϕi∂¯∂ϕ−iJ∂¯∂ϕ
2= 2n−∆ϕϕ
as claimed. /square
The following Lemma essentially follows from [45]
Lemma 2.2. Ifgis HKT, then
dΩn=ϑ∧Ωn
whereϑ=−Id∗ωis the Lee form of (ω,I). In particular Ric(ω) =dd∗ωand in the compact
case
dΩn= 0⇐⇒ωis balanced ⇐⇒Ric(ω) = 0.
Proof.It is quite easy to observe that
∗Ω =1
(n−1)!n!Ωn∧¯Ωn−1
and
∗α=−1
(n−1)!n!Jα∧Ωn∧¯Ωn−1
for every 1-form αof type (1,0) with respect to I. The HKT condition implies ϑ=−Jd∗ωJ=
−Kd∗ωK[26], hence
Jϑ=d∗ωJ=d∗(Ω+¯Ω) =−∗d∗(Ω+¯Ω) =−1
(n−1)!n!∗d/parenleftbig
Ωn∧¯Ωn−1+Ωn−1∧¯Ωn/parenrightbig
=−1
(n−1)!n!∗/parenleftbig
dΩn∧¯Ωn−1+Ωn−1∧d¯Ωn/parenrightbig
.
Clearly there exists a (0 ,1)-formβsuch thatdΩn=β∧Ωn, but from these computations it
follows that
Jϑ=−1
(n−1)!n!∗/parenleftbig
β∧Ωn∧¯Ωn−1+¯β∧Ωn−1∧¯Ωn/parenrightbig
=J(β+¯β)
and thusβ∧Ωn=ϑ∧Ωnas claimed. Moreover since ωis HKT it is Bismut-Ricci ﬂat and
formula (2.7) in [4] together implies Ric( ω) =dd∗ω. The last statement is trivial. /square
Remark 2.3. In [5] it is proved that on a compact nilmanifold ( N/Γ,I,J,K) a left-invariant
HKT metric is always balanced. This fact can be also deduced f rom Lemma 2.2 taking into
account that the Chern-Ricci form of a left-invariant Hermi tian metric on a complex nilmanifold
is always zero (see e.g. [29, Proposition 2.1]).THE PARABOLIC QUATERNIONIC CALABI-YAU EQUATION ON HYPERK ¨AHLER MANIFOLDS 5
3.From a bound of the Laplacian to C2,α-estimates
In [39] it is proved a general theorem for deducing C2,αestimates of a solution of an elliptic
equation from a bound on the Laplacian of the solution. The th eorem is applied in [39] to a
large class of equations in Hermitian geometry. In this sect ion we observe that it can be also
applied to the quaternionic Monge-Amp` ere equation.
Theorem 3.1. Let(M,I,J,K,g )ba a compact hyperhermitian manifold and ϕa solution to
(1)such that
(9) /ba∇dblϕ/ba∇dblC0≤Candtrggϕ≤C,
for some constant C >0. Then for 0<α<1there exists a constant Cα>0depending only on
(M,I,J,K,g ),f,αandCsuch that
/ba∇dbl∇2ϕ/ba∇dblCα≤Cα.
Proof.ChooseI-holomorphic local coordinates ( z1,...,z2n) in a chart, which for simplicity we
identify with the unit ball B1⊆C2n. Consider also the underlying real coordinates ( x1,...,x4n)
given byzk=xk+ix2n+kfork= 1,...,2nand theusual real representation of complex matrices
deﬁned as
ι(H) :=/parenleftbigg
Re(H) Im(H)
−Im(H) Re(H)/parenrightbigg
.
Let Herm(2 n) and Sym(4 n) be the spaces of 2 n×2nHermitian matrices and 4 n×4nreal
symmetric matrices respectively. Notice that ιsends Herm(2 n) to Sym(4 n). We deﬁne the
following functions
• F: Sym(4n)→Rgiven by F(N) :=1
2logdet(N);
• S:B1→Sym(4n) given by S(x) :=ι(g(x));
• T: Sym(4n)×B1→Sym(4n) given by T(N,x) :=1
4(p(N)+ι(tJ(x))p(N)ι(J(x))), where
pis the projection p(N) :=1
2(N+tINI).
Here, we are writing g(x) andJ(x) for the complex matrices of gandJat the point xin the
coordinates ( z1,...,z2n). For simplicity we set ˜J=ι(J). Sincep(D2

We check that all the assumptions H1−H3of [39, Theorem 1.2] are satisﬁed.

H1.(2) of [39, Theorem 1.2]). Moreover H1.(3) is trivial for Fsince it does not depend
onx.

andH2.(2) is straightforward. We just need to show that also H2.(3) holds. For any

•Condition H3obviously holds.
Since the assumptions H1−H3of [39, Theorem 1.2] are veriﬁed the theorem follows. /square
Remark 3.2. Theorem 3.1 was already proved by Alesker in the case of compa ct locally ﬂat
HKT manifolds [1]. Our version allows to simplify the proof o f the main theorem of [13].
Indeed the proof of the Alesker-Verbitsky conjecture on hyp erk¨ ahler manifolds is obtained in
[13] proving independently the C1estimate and a bound for the Laplacian and then combining
them in order to obtain the second order estimate. Hence the p roof of the Dinew and Sroka
theorem can be alternatively obtained bypassing the gradie nt estimate and using our Theorem
3.1. We also note that Theorem 3.1 does not need gto be HKT.
Next we focus on the “parabolic counterpart”of Theorem 3.1:
Theorem 3.3. Let0<α<1,ϕ(t),t∈[0,T), a solution to (3)such that
(10) osc
Mϕ≤C,/ba∇dbl˙ϕ/ba∇dblC0≤C,trggϕ≤C,
for some positive constant C. Letε∈(0,T). Thenϕ(t)satisﬁes the following a priori estimate
/ba∇dbl∇2ϕ/ba∇dblCα≤Cα
in[ε,T), whereCα>0depends only on (M,I,J,K,g ),f,α,Candε.
Proof.Here we apply the general result of Chu [11, Theorem 5.1], in t he same fashion as [12,
Lemma 6.1]. In the same notations of the previous theorem, wi thF,SandTchosen in the
same way, we have
˙ϕ(x,t)−F(S(x)+T(D2
Rϕ(x,t))) =−2f(x)−logdetg(x).THE PARABOLIC QUATERNIONIC CALABI-YAU EQUATION ON HYPERK ¨AHLER MANIFOLDS 7
From (10), the arithmetic-geometric means inequality and L emma 4.2 we get C≥trggϕ≥

C−1
0(δij)≤ S(x)+T(D2
Rϕ(x,t))≤C0(δij).
LetEdenote the compact convex subset
E:={N∈Sym(4n)|C−1
0(δij)≤N≤C0(δij)}.
All the assumptions H1−H3of [11, Theorem 5.1] are easily checked as in the previous the orem.
Nonetheless, atthispoint, wecannotdirectlyapply[11, Th eorem5.1]since ϕdoesnotnecessarily
satisfy aC0a priori bound. However, we can overcome this issue working a s in [12, Lemma
6.1]. Here is where the constant εplays a role. We consider the two cases T <1 andT≥1,
separately.
IfT <1, we have a uniform C0bound forϕsince
|ϕ|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplayt
0˙ϕdt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤Tsup
M×[0,T)|˙ϕ| ≤C.
In this case we can directly apply [11, Theorem 5.1] to conclu de.
IfT≥1 we consider, for any ﬁxed a∈(0,T−1), the following auxiliary function
ϕa(x,t) :=ϕ(x,t+a)−inf
B1×[a,a+1)ϕ, t ∈[0,1).
Clearly we have /ba∇dblϕa/ba∇dblC0≤oscMϕ≤C. Moreover, from (3) we see that ϕasatisﬁes the parabolic
Monge-Amp` ere equation
˙ϕa= 2log(Ω+∂∂Jϕa)n
Ωn−2f.
Since, from (10) we know that tr ggϕais uniformly bounded from above we may apply [11,
Theorem 5.1] to ϕaand deduce that for any ﬁxed ε∈(0,1
2) we have
/ba∇dbl∇2ϕ/ba∇dblCα(B×[a+ε,a+1))≤ /ba∇dbl∇2ϕa/ba∇dblCα(B1×[ε,1))≤C,
whereCis a uniform constant that depends on εandα. Sincea∈(0,T−1) is arbitrary we
obtain the estimate
/ba∇dbl∇2ϕ/ba∇dblCα(B1×[ε,T))≤C,
allowing us to conclude. /square
Remark 3.4. As usual in the elliptic case one can deduce higher order esti mates from Theorem
3.1 by using a standard bootstrapping argument via Schauder estimates and obtaining that
under the assumptions of Theorem 3.1
/ba∇dbl∇kϕ/ba∇dblCα≤Ck+α
for constants Ck+αdepending only on ( M,I,J,K,g ),f,α,kandC.
Analogously in the parabolic case under the assumptions of T heorem 3.3, ϕ(t) satisﬁes
/ba∇dbl∇kϕ/ba∇dblCα≤Ck+α
in [ε,T), whereCk+αdepends only on ( M,I,J,K,g ),f,α, k,εandC.8 LUCIO BEDULLI, GIOVANNI GENTILI AND LUIGI VEZZONI
4.Proof of Theorem 1.1
Let (M,I,J,K,g ) be a compact hyperhermitian manifold and, for f∈C∞(M), consider the
parabolic quaternionic Monge-Amp` ere equation (3).
Forϕ∈C∞(M) let
P(ϕ) = 2logΩn
ϕ
Ωn−2f.
The ﬁrst variation of P at ϕis
P∗|ϕ(ψ) = 2n∂∂Jψ∧Ωn−1
ϕ
Ωnϕ= ∆ϕψ,
where the last equality can be easily checked by using for ins tanceI-holomorphic coordinates
[13, Remark 2.13]. It follows that equation (3) is strictly p arabolic. In particular it always
admits a solution ϕ(t),t∈[0,ε), for some εsmall enough.
Lemma 4.1. The quaternionic parabolic Monge-Amp` ere equation (3)can be alternatively rewrit-
ten as
˙ϕ= logω2n
ϕ

Lemma 4.2. A solution ϕ(t)to(3)satisﬁes the following a priori estimates

for a uniform constant C >0depending only on (M,I,J,K,g )and/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblC0.
Proof.The technique of the proof is standard and for example analog ous to that of [19, The-
orems 2.1 and 2.2]; it relies on the elliptic C0-estimate obtained by Sroka [35] on compact
hyperhermitian manifolds. We give some details for complet eness. Diﬀerentiating (3) we get
that ˙ϕsatisﬁes
∂t˙ϕ= ∆ϕ˙ϕ
and from the parabolic maximum principle we infer that /ba∇dbl˙ϕ/ba∇dblC0≤Cfor some uniform positive
constantC. On the other hand, viewing ϕas a solution of the quaternionic Monge-Amp` ere
equation
(Ω+∂∂Jϕ)n= e˙ϕ
2+fΩn
with datum˙ϕ
2+fwe may use the main theorem in [35] to get osc Mϕ≤C. TheC0bound on
the time derivative of ˜ ϕis then straightforward. Moreover by deﬁnition of ˜ ϕfor everyt∈R+
such thatM×{t}is in the domain of ϕ, there exists x0∈Msuch that ˜ϕ(x0,t) = 0. Therefore
|˜ϕ(x,t)|=|˜ϕ(x,t)−˜ϕ(x0,t)|=|ϕ(x,t)−ϕ(x0,t)| ≤C,
and theC0bound on ˜ϕfollows. /squareTHE PARABOLIC QUATERNIONIC CALABI-YAU EQUATION ON HYPERK ¨AHLER MANIFOLDS 9

and let (x0,t0) be a maximum point of QonM×[0,T]. We may assume t0>0, otherwise
the estimate is obvious. Fix normal coordinates at x0with respect to the hyperk¨ ahler metric ˆ g.

and choosing A>Cwe get

see [33, Corollary 3.3.5], where we also used Lemma 4.2 again . SinceQ(x,t)≤Q(x0,t0) the
claim follows. /square
Proof of Theorem 1.1.Letϕ(t),t∈[0,T), be the maximal solution to (3). Assume by contra-
diction that Tis ﬁnite. In view of Lemmas 4.2, 4.3 and Remark 3.4 ˜ ϕis uniformly bounded in
Cknorm for every k. Hence ˜ϕis smooth at the time T, but then short-time existence would
imply that the solution exists on [0 ,T+δ) for someδ >0, contradicting the maximality of T,
henceT=∞.
The smooth convergence of ˜ ϕ(t) to someϕ∞∈C∞(M) can be obtained repeating almost
verbatim the argument of Gill [19, Sections 6 and 7]. The tech nique developed by Gill is inspired
by Li and Yau [30] and is focused on studying the heat-type equ ation
(16) ˙u= ∆ϕu.
In [19] a Harnack inequality is obtained and applied to u= ˙ϕin order to show that ˙˜ϕdecays
exponentially. This allows to deduce the convergence of ˜ ϕto a smooth function. We emphasise
that for us the dependence of gϕfrom the potential ϕis not the same as in [19], however the
argument never requires to express gϕin terms of the potential and the only thing that matters
is thatgϕis uniformly bounded in C∞.
Therefore, since u= ˙ϕsatisﬁes (16) and we have C∞bounds by Remark 3.4, ˜ ϕconverges
smoothly to some function ϕ∞∈C∞(M). Since ˜ϕsolves the equation
˙˜ϕ(t) = 2log(Ω+∂∂J˜ϕ(t))n

In order to conclude the proof of Theorem 1.1 we have still to o bserve that the equation has
at most one solution. Here we can work as follows: let ( ϕ,b),(ψ,c) be two solutions to (1) with
b≥c. We have that

On the left hand-side we have a second order linear elliptic o perator without free term applied
toϕ−ψand from the maximum principle and the fact that supMϕ= supMψ= 0 it follows
ϕ=ψ. Hence we have also b=cand uniqueness follows. /square
5.The adapted Chern-Ricci flow
In this section we consider ﬂow (5) on hypercomplex manifold s.
Given a compact hyperhermitian manifold ( M,I,J,K,g ) and a covariant 2-tensor S, we
denote by
S−:=1
2(S−JS)
itsJ-anti-invariant part in order to rewrite (5) as
˙ω(t) =−Ric−(ω(t)), ω(0) =ω.
Analogously to the K¨ ahler and the Hermitian case the ﬂow is e quivalent to a scalar one
(17) ˙ ϕ(t) = log(ω−tRic−(ω)+(i∂¯∂ϕ(t))−)2n
ω2n, ϕ(0) = 0.
Indeed, ifϕsolves (17), then ω(t) :=ω−tRic−(ω)+(i∂¯∂ϕ(t))−solves (5) since
˙ω(t) =−Ric−(ω)+(i∂¯∂˙ϕ(t))−=−Ric−(ω)+/parenleftbigg
i∂¯∂logω(t)2n

=−Ric−(ω(t)).
Conversely if ω(t) solves (5), then we deﬁne
ϕ(t) :=/integraldisplayt

and we have
∂t(ω(t)−ω+tRic−(ω)−(i∂¯∂ϕ(t))−) =−Ric−(ω(t))+Ric−(ω)−(i∂¯∂˙ϕ(t))−
=−Ric−(ω(t))+Ric−(ω)−/parenleftbigg
i∂¯∂logω(t)2n
ω2n/parenrightbigg−
= 0
which implies ω(t) =ω−tRic−(ω)+(i∂¯∂ϕ(t))−for allt.
According to the K¨ ahler [38] and the Hermitian case [41], it is quite natural to introduce the
following conjecture
Conjecture 5.1. There exists a unique maximal solution to the ﬂow (5)on[0,T), where
T= sup{t≥0 :there exists ψ∈C∞(M)s.t.ω−tRic(ω)−+i(∂¯∂ψ)−>0}.12 LUCIO BEDULLI, GIOVANNI GENTILI AND LUIGI VEZZONI
Note that, if cBC
1(M,I) = 0, then ﬂow (5) is equivalent to the parabolic quaternioni c Monge-
Amp` ere equation (3). In particular Theorem 1.1 implies tha t if (M,I,J,K ) has an underlying
hyperk¨ ahler metric, then (5) has a long-time solution and t he conjecture in this special case is
veriﬁed. In order to prove the conjecture in the general case we need a priori estimates on the
solutionϕto (17). We can observe that estimates can be obtained workin g as in the complex
case [41, Lemma 4.1] except for the estimate for the second or der derivatives which we leave
open.
Proposition 5.2. Let(M,I,J,K,g )be a compact hyperhermitian manifold and ω(t)a solution
of(5). Assume that there exists a uniform positive constant Csuch that
C−1ω≤ω(t)≤Cω,
then Conjecture 5.1 holds.
Flow (17) ﬁts in the following quite general class of parabol ic problems:
let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold and
Ft:C2
+(M)→C0(M), t∈[0,T),
a smooth family of second-order partial diﬀerential operato rs deﬁned on an open subset C2
+(M)
ofC2(M). Assume that −Ft:C2
+(M)→C0(M) is strongly elliptic for every t∈[0,T). Assume
further that
Ft(ψ+C) =Ft(ψ)
for everyψ∈C2
+(M),t∈[0,T) and constant C. Then we consider the parabolic ﬂow
(18) ˙ ϕ(t) =Ft(ϕ(t)), ϕ(0) = 0.
Lemma 5.3. Assume that there exists a continuous map Λ:M×[0,T)→Rsuch that for any
0<T′<Tandψ∈C2(M×[0,T′])
Ft0(ψ(t0))(x0)≤Λ(x0,t0)if(x0,t0)is a maximum point of ψ,
then solutions to (18)satisfy a uniform upper bound. Analogously, if there exists a continuous
mapλ:M×[0,T)→Rsuch that for any 0<T′<Tandψ∈C2(M×[0,T′])
Ft0(ψ(t0))(x0)≥λ(x0,t0)if(x0,t0)is a minumum point of ψ,
then solutions to (18)satisfy a uniform lower bound.
Proof.Letϕ∈C2(M×[0,T′)) be a solution of (18) with T′<T. Fix 0<T′′<T′and consider
ψ(t) :=ϕ(t)−At, whereA >maxM×[0,T′]Λ is a positive constant. Let ( x0,t0) be a maximum
point ofψinM×[0,T′′]. Since
∂tψ(x0,t0) =Ft0(ϕ(t0))(x0)−A=Ft0(ψ(t0))(x0)−A≤Λ(x0,t0)−A<0,
thent0= 0 and, since ψ0≡0,
ϕ(x,t)≤tA≤T′A
for every (x,t)∈M×[0,T′′]. SinceT′′is arbitrary the upper bound on ϕfollows.
In a similar way, considering η(t) =ϕ(t) +Bt, whereB >−minM×[0,T′]λ, at a minimum
point ofηinM×[0,T′′] we achieve a lower bound. /square
Lemma 5.4. Letϕ∈C2(M×[0,T′))be a solution to (18)uniformly bounded from above, where
0< T′< T. Assume that there exists a continuous function g: [0,T]→Rsuch that for every
T′<T′′<Twe have
(T′′−t)(∂tFt)(ϕ(t)) +g(t)−(Ft)∗|ϕ(t)ϕ(t)>0for allt∈[0,T′),THE PARABOLIC QUATERNIONIC CALABI-YAU EQUATION ON HYPERK ¨AHLER MANIFOLDS 13
then the ﬁrst time derivative of ϕsatisﬁes a uniform lower bound. Analogously, if ϕ∈C2(M×
[0,T′))is a solution to (18)uniformly bounded from below and there exists a continuous f unction
h: [0,T]→Rsuch that
t(∂tFt)(ϕ(t))−h(t)+(Ft)∗|ϕ(t)ϕ(t)≤0for allt∈[0,T′),
then the ﬁrst time derivative of ϕsatisﬁes a uniform lower bound.
Proof.LetGbe a primitive function of gsuch thatG(0) = 0. Fix T′<T′′<Tand deﬁne
Q(t) = (T′′−t) ˙ϕ(t)+ϕ(t)+G(t)
Then
∂tQ(t) = (T′′−t)¨ϕ(t)+g(t)
and
(Ft)∗|ϕ(t)Q(t) = (T′′−t)(Ft)∗|ϕ(t)˙ϕ(t)+(Ft)∗|ϕ(t)˙ϕ(t)
Since ˙ϕ(t) =Ft(ϕ(t)), we have ¨ ϕ(t) = (Ft)∗|ϕ(t)˙ϕ(t)+(∂tFt)(ϕ(t)). Therefore using our assump-
tions
∂tQ(t)−(Ft)∗|ϕ(t)Q(t) = (T′′−t)(∂tFt)(ϕ(t))+g(t)−(Ft)|∗ϕ(t)˙ϕ(t)>0
and by the maximum principle
(T′′−t) ˙ϕ(t)+ϕ(t)+G(t) =Q(t)≥inf
MQ(0) =T′′inf
M˙ϕ(0),
for anyt∈[0,T′), i.e.,
(T′′−t) ˙ϕ(t)≥T′′inf
M˙ϕ(0)−ϕ(t)−G(t).
Sinceϕis uniformly bounded from above, then we have
(T′′−t) ˙ϕ(t)≥ −C
for a uniform positive constant C. Hence
˙ϕ(t)≥ −C
T′′−T′
and the claim follows.
For the lower bound of ˙ ϕwe consider the quantity
S(t) =t˙ϕ(t)−ϕ(t)−H(t)
whereHis a primitive of hsuch thatH(0) = 0 and proceed analogously. /square
Proof of Proposition 5.2. Uniqueness of solutions to (5) follows from the same propert y of the
equivalent ﬂow (17). To prove that the solution ω(t) to (5) exists on [0 ,T) it is enough to focus
on the parabolic Monge-Amp` ere-type equation (17). By stan dard parabolic theory there is a
uniquesolution ϕ(t) to (17) on a maximal time interval [0 ,T′). Assumeby contradiction T′<T.
Taking
Λ =λ= log(ω−tRic−(ω))2n
ω2n
Lemma 5.3 applies to ﬂow (17). Furthermore, taking g(t) =h(t) = 2nLemma 5.4 also applies.
Combining these with the assumption C−1ω≤ω(t)≤Cωand working in the same fashion
as in Theorem 3.3 and applying [11, Theorem 5.1] we obtain uni form estimates on ϕ(t) of any
order on [0 ,T′). In particular lim t→T′ϕ(x,t) is still smooth and short time-existence gives a
contradiction, since we would then be able to extend the ﬂow o n [0,T′+ε) for someε>0./square14 LUCIO BEDULLI, GIOVANNI GENTILI AND LUIGI VEZZONI
6.Remarks and Further Developments
From the geometric point of view the conjecture of Alesker an d Verbitsky consists in prescrib-
ing theJ-anti-invariant part of the Chern-Ricci tensor of an HKT met ric in a ﬁxed quaternionic
Bott-Chern cohomology class. The existence of Chern-Ricci ﬂat HKT metrics on a hypercom-
plex manifold implies that the canonical bundle is holomorp hically trivial. When the canonical
bundleis not holomorphically trivial, it is quite natural t o study the existence of hyperhermitian
metricsωsatisfying the Einsten-type condition
(19) Ric −JRic =λω,for some constant λ,
or, moregenerally, ofhyperhermitianmetricswithconstan tChern-scalarcurvature(thisresearch
project has been suggested to the second named author by Mish a Verbitsky). Equation (19)
can be rewritten in terms of Ω as
(20) ∂Jϑ1,0=λΩ,
whereϑis the Lee form. In the compact case (20) forces λto be non-negative and on Joyce
homogeneous examples [28] (which are the simplest examples of compact HKT manifolds where
the canonical bundle is not holomorphically trivial) the ca nonical metric satisﬁes (20) [16].
Sinceλis non-negative, in analogy with the K¨ ahler case, we expect that it is possible to ﬁnd
obstructions to the existence of HKT metrics satisfying (20 ).
In order to study the existence of HKT metrics having constan t Chern scalar curvature it is
quite natural to consider the following analogue of the Cala bi-ﬂow on HKT manifolds
(21) ˙ ϕ(t) =sϕ(t), ϕ(0) = 0,
wheresϕ(t) is the Chern-scalar curvature of Ω ϕ:= Ω+∂∂Jϕ(t) and Ω is a ﬁxed HKT metric.
