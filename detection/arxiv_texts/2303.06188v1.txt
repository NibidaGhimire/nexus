Abstract
1T-TaSe2is widely believed to host a Mott metal-insulator transitio n in the charge density
wave (CDW) phase according to the spectroscopic observatio n of a band gap that extends across
all momentum space. Previous investigations inferred that the occurrence of the Mott phase
is limited to the surface only of bulk specimens, but recent a nalysis on thin samples revealed
that the Mott-like behavior, observed in the monolayer, is r apidly suppressed with increasing
thickness. Here, we report combined time- and angle-resolv ed photoemission spectroscopy and
theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of 1T-TaSe2. Our experimental results conﬁrm
the existence of a state above EF, previously ascribed to the upper Hubbard band, and an overa ll
band gap of ∼0.7 eV at Γ. However, supported by density functional theory calcula tions, we
demonstrate that the origin of this state and the gap rests on band structure modiﬁcations induced
by the CDW phase alone, without the need for Mott correlation eﬀects.

1The accurate understanding of electronic phases in quantum mate rials is a central topic
in condensed matter physics. New emergent phenomena often aris e from the competition or
cooperation of such phases and their complete description can guid e the design of material
fuctionalities[ 1,2]. Inrecent years, chargedensity waves (CDWs) havebeenfound tocoexist
in several material classes with other correlated electronic groun d states such as supercon-
ductivity or Mott-like insulating phases [ 3–5]. The latter involve electron localization in a
partially ﬁlled band driven by electron-electron interactions and do n ot necessarily involve
changesinthelatticestructureorelectron-phononcoupling, whic harecorefeaturesofCDWs
[6]. When several broken symmetry states of diﬀerent nature coex ist in the same material,
it becomes challenging to single out what gives rise to its properties on the macroscopic
scale and consequently the response to experimental probes. Lo w temperature electronic
transport has often been used to assess transitions to insulating or superconducting phases,
but spectroscopic investigations have deepened our understand ing [7,8].
Examples of such materials are the isostructural tantalum-based metal dichalcogenides,
1T-TaS2and 1T-TaSe2, well-known CDW systems with several electronic phases [ 9,10].
The more extensively studied 1 T-TaS2exhibits a series of consecutive CDW transitions with
increasing commensurability; from incommensurate, to nearly-com mensurate to fully com-
mensurate (CCDW) below 180 K. The CCDW transition is characterize d by a ﬁrst-order
increase in the resistivity often assigned to a Mott metal-to-insulat or transitions (MIT)
[11,12]. Mott localization arises from the decreased bandwidth of the half ﬁ lled Ta-5 d
band when entering the CDW phase and from the increased on-site e lectron interactions.
In this picture, the band crossing the Fermi level splits into the lowe r and upper Hubbard
bands, LHB and UHB, respectively [ 13]. 1T-TaSe2, which is the focus of this Letter, has
a simpler CDW behaviour with a single commensurate transition below 47 3 K [9]. Thus,
it was suggested to be the more ideal compound to investigate the r elationship between
CDW and Mott [ 14] because of (i) well-separated transition temperatures (CCDW be low
473 K, Mott below 260 K [ 15]), (ii) large electronic gap and (iii) reduced complexity due
to absence of non-commensurate CDW phases. The bulk electrical behaviour is consistent
with a partially gapped Fermi surface typical of a 2D CDW phase, thu s Mott phenom-
ena were not considered in early investigations [ 11]. However, thanks to the recent growth
of single-layer 1 T-TaSe2and thus reduced charge screening, the presence of an electron ic
gap was revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( ARPES) and scanning tun-
2nelling spectroscopy (STS). The nature of this gap was discussed c onsidering Mott electron
correlations in density-functional theory (DFT) calculations comb ined with the Hubbard
correction (DFT+U) [ 16–18]. Reports of electronic gaps up to ∼0.5 eV in bulk samples
by ARPES and STS have been interpreted assuming Mott physics con ﬁned to the crystal
surface [15,19,20]. Such experimental techniques alone cannot describe the nature of the
gap and, while ARPES oﬀers the possibility of a comparison with the calc ulated band struc-
ture, it fails to probe unoccupied bands, which are necessary to es timate gaps across the
Fermi surface. Time-resolved ARPES (trARPES) uses an ultrasho rt pump laser pulse to
promoteelectrons into the conductionband (CB) beforethearriv alof aprobepulse inducing
photoemission, and oﬀers the ability to monitor unoccupied states, their energy dispersion
and population dynamics. In addition, the possibility to explore out of equilibrium prop-
erties, perturb electronic and lattice order, and launch coherent phonons gives additional
information which remains hidden to static techniques [ 21–23].
In this Letter, we employ trARPES with an infrared pump (0.6 eV) tha t is resonant with
the expected electronic gap of bulk 1 T-TaSe2in order to transiently populate the CB and
investigate its electron dynamics. We ﬁnd that the gap evolves on a t imescale consistent
with electron-phonon interactions rather than that of electron- electron correlations. Using
DFT band structure calculations, we further demonstrate how th e electronic gap seen in
ARPES is in fact a consequence of the CDW reconstruction and does not explicitly require
electron-electron correlation eﬀects. In particular, we show tha t the gap opening at the
Fermi level at Γ is linked to the charge distribution across the CDW unit cell. Our work
highlights the relevance of a charge transfer mechanism in CDW syst ems.

to previous ARPES investigations [ 25–27], constant binding energy cuts close to the Fermi
level reveal large elliptical electron pockets centered at the Mpoint of the Brillouin Zone
(BZ), as shown in Fig. 1b. Here, we introduce the Cpoint which is the midpoint between
MandK, and then focus on the MΓCpath (blue solid line in Fig. 1b) that maximizes the
intersection with these pockets. We demonstrate how this is key fo r observing the bottom
CB. Fig. 1c shows the trARPES experimental layout. Photo-excitation was p rovided by 0.6
eV pulses with ﬂuence of 3 mJ/cm2at 1 kHz repetition rate. Photoemission spectra were

acquired with 21 eV pulses produced via high harmonic generation in ar gon, which gives
access to the entire ﬁrst BZ of 1 T-TaSe2. The overall time and energy resolution of the setup
is 90 fs and 200 meV, respectively. The sample was held at 80 K during m easurements.
Fig.2a shows the ARPES maps measured along MΓ at selected pump-probe delays. The
highest occupied state is the Ta-dominant valence band (VB), which shows a discontinuity,
highlighted by dashed ellipses, arising from an avoided crossing due to band folding in the
CDW phase (see Supplementary E). At 0.2 ps after the pump (middle m ap in Fig. 2a) the
discontinuity is blurred, but it fully recovers within 4 ps. The energy d istribution curves

(EDCs) at equally separated momenta along MΓ are shown in Fig. 2b for negative pump-
probe delay. They reveal a gap at k||≃0.85˚A−1(bold brown curve) whose dynamics can
be retrieved through a double-peak ﬁtting procedure, as illustrat ed in Fig. 2c. The peak
separation ∆ Erepresents the CDW gap [ 14] and Fig. 2d displays its temporal evolution. It
is instructive to compare this with the dynamics observed in the prox imity of the Fermi level
(k||≃0.21˚A−1, boldorangecurveinFig. 2b). Uponlaserexcitation, electronsfromoccupied
states are promptly driven out of equilibrium. Using the Fermi-Dirac f unction in the EDCs
of the VB at k||≃0.21˚A−1(see Supplementary C), the transient electronic temperature is
deduced, as reported in the inset of Fig. 2d (black dots). The pulsewidth-limited rise time
5of the electronic temperature is attributed to electron-electron scattering processes in the
VB occurring within the pulse duration (sub-100 fs). The subseque nt cooling is ascribed to
electron-phonon interaction with acharacteristic scattering time τep≃0.75 ps. Additionally,
a strong coherent phonon oscillation of the VB is observed (see Fig. 2d, orange dots); its
frequency ν≃2 THz identiﬁes the so-called breathing mode [ 28–30], that is a coherent
expansion and contraction of the star triggered by a displacive mec hanism [31], as evidenced
by the phase of the oscillations (see Supplementary B). Despite the fact that an intense
electronic perturbation is promptly induced by the photoexcitation (Te∼5000 K), only
a moderate ∼22% reduction of the CDW gap is observed, with its minimum value being
reached about 0.3 ps after the optical excitation (Fig. 2d, main panel). Such a response
is perfectly compatible with the lattice dynamics, since it matches half the period of the
breathing mode (1 /2ν≃0.25 ps) and dictates the fastest response time of the lattice to
an external perturbation. This fact provides clear evidence that the CDW gap is lattice-
related and rather robust against electronic perturbations from an optical excitation. Both
CDW gap and electronic temperature recover with the same charac teristic time constant τep
implying a common mechanism, that is electron-phonon coupling.
We now focus on the central experimental result of this Letter. F ig.3a shows the band
structure of of 1 T-TaSe2along the ΓCdirection as measured by trARPES at selected pump-
probe delays (for completeness the full MΓCpath at 0 ps delay is reported). At 0 ps, a
transiently populated state (TS) above EFspanning the probed ΓCregion can be seen
(dashed rectangle), which disappears 1 ps after the optical excit ation. This state is hardly
observed along MΓ. Fig.3b shows the EDCs measured in the time window between −0.05
and +0.85 ps (step of 0.1 ps) and integrated over 0 .6< k||<0.9˚A−1. After removing
the residual spectral weight extending from the VB above the Fer mi level, the TS and its
dynamics clearly emerge in Fig. 3c. The solid lines are Gaussian ﬁts from which intensity
and binding energy of the TS are extrapolated, respectively in Fig. 3d and Fig. 3e. We
ﬁnd a lifetime τTS≃450 fs (Fig. 3d) which is shorter than the electron-phonon scattering
time, indicating the presence of additional relaxation and recombina tion channels. The
binding energy of the TS (Fig. 3e) reveals a weak temporal dependence, converging towards
the value ETS−EF≃0.38 eV. For comparison, the binding energy EVB−EFof the VB
is reported, showing the eﬀect of the coherent phonon oscillation p reviously discussed. We
noticethatthepeak-to-peakenergyseparationbetweenTSand VB,ETS−EV B, isessentially

modulated by the dynamics of the latter. If we were to label VB and T S as the lower and
upper Hubbard bands, we would obtain a Coulomb correlation energy of∼0.7 eV. This
value is slightly larger, but still compatible with previous investigations [15,19] within our
7energy resolution (0.2 eV). However, the lifetime τTSof the TS provides a strong indication
of its nature. First, it cannot be ascribed to a laser-induced excita tion continuum, as it
would bear a much shorter lifetime [ 32] with binding energy rapidly converging towards
EF. On the other hand, it cannot be assigned to a Hubbard-like band: r ecent trARPES
measurements on 1 T-TaS2revealed the UHB and its relaxation was estimated to occur on
the timescale of electron hopping /planckover2pi1/J∼14 fs [32]. Given the structural and electronic
similarities with 1 T-TaS2, one would expect a comparable timescale in 1 T-TaSe2. However,
our data reveal a lifetime of the TS which is ∼30 times longer, rebutting its Mott-like
nature. DFT calculations also predict the existence of the TS above the Fermi level with
a large spectral weight in the Γ Cdirection, as observed in the experiments, but its origin
rests on the speciﬁc electronic structure induced by the star-like reconstruction, as clariﬁed
in the following.
In the CDW phase there are three types of nonequivalent Ta atoms labeledA,Band
Cin Fig.4a, with numerical proportion 1 : 6 : 6. Atom A(green) lies at the center of
the star, atoms B(blue) are the nearest neighbors, atoms C(red) occupy the tips of the
star. The projected density-of-states (PDOS) in Fig. 4b shows that each atom type has
a diﬀerent electronic occupancy. By integrating the PDOS over the energy range spanned
by the highest Ta-dominant VB (from −1.3 eV toEF, see Supplementary E), the relative
electronic charges Si=A,B,Care estimated: electrons accumulate towards the center of the
star (SA≃SB≃0.76), depleting the tips ( SC≃0.45) [33]. This eﬀect, perfectly consistent
with the CDW description, is inherently governed by the electronic ba nd conﬁguration in
the charge-ordered phase. Focusing our attention on the MΓCpath of the BZ, Fig. 4c
reports the calculated band structure of the undistorted 1 T-TaSe2, i.e. with no PLD. The
thick line marks the Ta-dominant band with metallic character (as exp ected in the normal
phase), which would split into LHB and UHB in a Mott insulator picture. F ig.4d shows the
unfolded band structure at an intermediate distortion (i.e. 1/2 PLD , see Supplementary E)
between theundistorted (Fig. 4c) andthefully-developed CDW phases (Fig. 4e). Panels (c)-
(e) track the band evolution with increasing PLD; the Ta band splits in to two main replicas,
one moving above the Fermi level and a manifold shifting below it. The f ormer, being
partially above EF, hosts fewer electrons than the latter. Based on the charge occ upancies
inferred from the integrated PDOS (Fig. 4b), we associate the band below EFto atoms A
andB, while its higher energy equivalent to atoms C. This scenario is further supported

by atom-speciﬁc projections: the band structures in Fig. 4d-e are superimposed to the
corresponding contributions of atoms type B(inner part of the star) and type C(tips of
the star) in blue and red color, respectively, conﬁrming that the ou ter portion of the star
hosts the unoccupied states, while the inner part spawns the Ta ba nds below EF. In the
following, we will exploit the calculated PDOS and electronic occupancie s to quantitatively
estimate the energy shifts of the two Ta-band replicas arising in the charge-ordered phase.
Referring to the undistorted structure (Fig. 4c and4f) one can notice that a rigid shift
9of the entire band structure to lower[higher] energy with respect toEFwould result in
a larger[smaller] electron occupancy (shifting the entire band stru cture to positive energy
corresponds to moving EFto negative values). In practice, by moving the Fermi level in
Fig.4f, we can tune the electronic occupancy Sof the Ta-dominant state in the undistorted
lattice to match those of atoms type BorCin the distorted phases. The corresponding
shifted bands are shown in Fig. 4g-h (numerical details for both 1/2 PLD and full PLD
cases are given in the Supplementary F). They are superimposed to the respective unfolded
band structures (gray dots), revealing a good agreement. In ot her words, the VB and the
TS experimentally observed by trARPES (Fig. 3a) are both Ta-dominant bands originating
from diﬀerent Ta atom types of the star ( BandC, respectively). Notice that PLD hinders
the metallic character, opening a gap across EF. Although the predicted dispersion of
the unoccupied Ta band along Γ C(Fig.4e) cannot be fully probed by our measurements
(its bandwidth is comparable to our energy resolution and the pump p hoton energy of
0.6 eV might not populate it homogeneously) the binding energy deter mined experimentally
matches the computed value well. We point out that our DFT calculatio ns capture all main
features of the charge-ordered electronic structure without e mploying Hubbard correlation
terms. Considering the structural and electronic similarities of 1 T-TaSe2and 1T-TaS2, one
may discuss why the Mott phase appears only in the latter. A compar ison between their
surface-projected band structures in the undistorted phase ( Supplementary G) shows (i) a
reduced bandwidth of the Ta-dominant band in the sulﬁde, as compa red to the selenide,
indicating stronger electron localization in 1 T-TaS2which may favor the Mott transition
and (ii) hybridization of chalcogen and metal states at EFin 1T-TaSe2, but not in 1 T-TaS2,
suggesting enhanced screening in the selenide which may hinder the M ott phase.
In conclusion, trARPES data reveal that under photoexcitation c onditions leading to a
considerable increase of the electronic temperature ( kBTe∼0.4 eV, Fig. 2d), the induced
closure of the CDW gap in the Ta-dominant band is relatively moderate (∆E∼0.1 eV,
Fig.2d) and established at the lattice level, as evidenced by the gap respo nse time matching
halftheperiodofthestarbreathingmode(1 /2ν= 0.25ps, Fig. 2d, inset). Thisfactsuggests
that electron-phonon coupling dominates over electronic instabilitie s in the formation of the
CDW, in accordance with previous works [ 28,34,35]. The results shown in Fig. 3and
Fig.4prove that, from a purely electronic viewpoint, when entering the C DW phase, charge
migration from the tips towards the center of the star leads to the appearance of a charge-
10transfergap rather than a Mott gap [ 36], as corroborated by the temporal evolution of the
transiently populated state above EFseen with trARPES, and by DFT calculations. While
we cannot disagree with the fact that monolayer 1 T-TaSe2might be a Mott system, our
investigation confutes the Mott nature of its bulk counterpart.
