Abstract
We assessed changes in calculus proficiency and calculus se lf-efficacy in a second semester
course of introductory physics focused on electricity and m agnetism. While all students
demonstrated an increase in calculus proficiency, includi ng a possible improvement in calculus
transfer to physics, women displayed larger gains than men. Conversely, men showed larger
gains in calculus self-efficacy. When combined, these data suggest that student identity
modulates the correlation between a student’s calculus abi lities and their perception or
self-evaluation of those abilities. These data highlight a potential contributing factor to
gender-related differences in physics self-efficacy as we ll as the complexity of addressing
those differences.
1 Introduction
The ability to use mathematics is an essential skill common t o all science and engineering
disciplines. Because of this and due to economic and logisti c constraints, courses in
introductory mathematics at most colleges and universitie s are shared by many degree
programs and centrally taught in a department of mathematic s. Unfortunately, this structure
can result in the mathematics being decontextualized, ther eby placing on students the burden
of transferring their skills in solving mathematical probl ems to other STEM areas. However,
while students are generally expected to be capable of this t ransference, evidence suggests that
it actually poses a large barrier to student learning in phys ics [4, 6, 25, 29]. Indeed, the
emphasis on applied mathematics in introductory physics co urses is believed to be responsible
for the observed positive correlation between mathematics ability and student performance in
these courses [3, 5, 16, 17]. Although we and others have sugg ested how calculus proficiency
in introductory physics and possibly mathematics transfer to physics may be improved
[18, 19, 36, 39], a quantitative analysis of how curriculum c hanges and/or interventions in
introductory physics affect student ability to solve calcu lus problems in the context of physics
has not yet been completed. As part of an ongoing effort to add ress this need, we report here
our analysis of proficiency with integral calculus in the co ntext of introductory physics,
covering electricity and magnetism, combined with an indep endent assessment of calculus
self-efficacy. We show that while a positive correlation be tween student self-assessment of
calculus ability and student proficiency with calculus exi sts for men, a negative correlation
between these traits is present for women, even though women perform equal to or better than
men on assessments of calculus proficiency. These results t hus build off our previous work
indicating an identity-modulated correlation between phy sics self-efficacy and calculus
proficiency [9].
1/162 Background
The suggested schedule for most calculus-based STEM ( e.g., physical sciences and
engineering) degree programs at the University of Kansas ha s students enrolling in General
Physics II (the second semester of calculus-based introduc tory physics covering electricity and
magnetism) during their third semester at the same time they are enrolled in the third semester
of calculus; General Physics I is taken alongside the second semester of calculus. The
coordinating scheduling of calculus and introductory phys ics courses allows us to task students
with using calculus continually in their physics courses [1 0, 11, 19] and thus to assess how
well students transfer their calculus knowledge and skills to physics. When characterizing and
analyzing this knowledge transfer, we use the model propose d by Rebello et al. [29], which
builds upon earlier work by Gagn´ e [13] and Reddish [30]. In t his context, we make a
distinction between horizontal transfer, which describes the use of new information in existing
mental models and vertical transfer in which an existing men tal model does not exist, thus
requiring the creation of new mental models [6, 9].
Self-efficacy is a measure of one’s belief to succeed [8, 27, 33]. As such, it can affect many
dimensions of learning including motivation [28], interes t [42], engagement [34], and how
difficult tasks are perceived [40]. Not surprisingly, self -efficacy influences both performance
and retention in STEM courses [33] and women often have lower self-efficacy in physics than
men despite performing similarly or better than men in their physics courses [8, 23, 27].
2.1 Research Questions
This work seeks to address the following research questions (RQ) in the context of our
calculus-based introductory physics courses:
RQ1. How does the emphasis on calculus in introductory physics co urses affect
student ability with pure and applied calculus?
RQ2. How is student self-efficacy for using calculus in introduc tory physics
correlated with student proficiency for pure and applied ca lculus?
3 Methodology
Students in General Physics II at the University of Kansas ar e tasked with using integral
calculus to calculate the electric and magnetic fields and p otentials of distributions of electric
charge, electric and magnetic flux, and the electric and mag netic forces and potential energies
associated with the interactions of charged systems. Our su rvey for assessing calculus
proficiency in this course builds upon a previously impleme nted assessment [9] and consists of
the following six questions:
C1.Complete the following integral6/integraltext

C2.Complete the following integral1/integraltext

(x2+1)2dx
C3.The population of a town, denoted by the variable P, increases at a rate described by the
following equation:dP
dt= 20+0 .6t2. The variable tis the time. What is the population of the
time att= 5if the population at t= 0is 0.
C4.The electric potential energy (Ue)of a point particle
with electric charge qin the presence of an external electric potential
(Ve)isUe=qVe. The uniformly charged straight and rigid rod shown
in the figure is in the presence of the following external ele ctric potential:

x2. The variable xin this equation denotes the position
along the x-axis as defined in the figure. The rod has a length of 2 m and
a constant electric charge density of 3C
m. Determine the electric potential energy associated
with the interaction between the rod and the external electr ic potential.
C5.The electric
potential(Ve)a distance raway from a point particle with electric
chargeqis described by the following equation: Ve=q
4πǫr. The straight
and rigid rod shown in the figure to the right has a length of 4 m and
a non-uniform linear electric charge density described by t he following
equation:/parenleftbig

x. The variable xin this equation denotes
position along the x-axis as defined in the figure. Determine the electric
potential of this rod at the position Pthat is a distance 3 m above one
end of the rod as shown in the figure. The variable ǫ= 1×10−11C
Vm.
C6.The moment of inertia (I)of a point particle with
massmlocated a distance xaway from an axis of rotation is I=mx2.
The straight and rigid rod shown in the figure to the right has a length of
2 m and non-uniform mass density described by the following e quation:/parenleftBig

m3/parenrightBig
x2. The variable xin this equation denotes position along the
x-axis as defined in the figure. Determine the moment of inert ia of this
rod for rotations around an axis located at x= 0m .
We denote questions C1, C2, and C3 on this survey as “pure” cal culus questions.
Conversely, we denote questions C4, C5, and C6 as “applied” c alculus questions as they
require students to use calculus within a physics context. W e also note that the integration
required to solve C4 and C6 is equivalent to the integration r equired to solve C1. Similarly, the
integration required to solve C5 is equivalent to the integr ation required to solve C2. Finally,
since students at our institution have not used calculus to d etermine moments of inertia in
General Physics I or General Physics II [9], solving C6 requi res represents a new application of
integral calculus in the context of physics. However, by pro mpting students with the equation
for the moment of inertia of a point particle, we hoped that st udent would recognize that the
integration necessary for the solution is similar to the int egration necessary to solve C1 and C4.
Our assessment of calculus self-efficacy [9] consists of th e three questions shown in Figure
1. The calculus self-efficacy survey and calculus proficie ncy survey were administered at the
beginning (survey 1), in the middle (survey 2), and at the end (survey 3) of the semester in
General Physics II during the Summer 2021 and Fall 2021 semes ters. The responses to survey
questions were graded as favorable, neutral, or unfavorabl e, and given a corresponding
numeric score of 3, 2, or 1; for the calculus proficiency surv ey, a correct answer was scored
favorable and an incorrect answer was scored unfavorable.
Figure 1. The calculus self-efficacy questions used in this study.
The total enrollment in the courses where the surveys were de ployed was 362 students,
however, not all students consented to their survey results being included in the analysis
presented here. We further restricted our data set to only th ose students who completed all
3/16self-efficacy surveys and all calculus proficiency survey s so that our analysis was conducted
on matched students only. This leaves a total of 293 students in General Physics II (205 men
and 88 women) included in the results presented here. Please note that since we are relying
upon institutional data for creating these cohorts of stude nts, these divisions do not therefore
necessarily reflect how students identify personally.
4 Results
4.1 Validation of the Survey
In our first analysis of the survey results, we calculated th e discrimination and difficulty of
each calculus proficiency question [2, 32]; note that diffi culty is defined as the fraction of
students answering the question correctly [2, 32]. As shown in Figure 2, a smaller fraction of
students answered the “applied” calculus questions (C4, C5 , and C6) correctly than answered
the “pure” calculus questions (C1, C2, and C3) correctly. Th is is consistent with the
expectation that “applied” calculus questions would be mor e difficult for students, perhaps
owing to difficulties of using calculus in a physics context (i.e., with calculus transfer to
physics). All questions showed a discrimination above 0.35 , suggesting that these questions
provide moderate to high discrimination [32].

To establish the separability of three different categorie s of questions on the assessment -
pure calculus questions, applied calculus questions, and c alculus self-efficacy questions - we
performed an exploratory factor analysis on the items in the survey. A principal components
analysis with Varimax rotation method was used, and the init ial eigenvalues indicated that the
first three components (all with eigenvalues greater than 1 ) explained a total of 51% of the
variance. The factor loadings determined from these princi pal components are shown in Table
1. Factor 1 is associated with calculus self-efficacy quest ions (S1, S2, and S3), factor 2 is
associated with the “pure calculus” questions (C1, C2, and C 3), and factor 3 is associated with
the “applied calculus” questions (C4, C5, and C6). Thus, the data supported the existence of
three separate scales and items loaded on the scales as inten ded.
When the fourth principal component is included in the analy sis, the total variance
explained increases to 62%. Factor 1 and factor 2 generated b y this analysis are identical in
composition to those determined using only the first three e igenvectors. The newly determined
factor 3 is associated with question C3 and question C6, and t he new factor 4 is associated
with question C5. We ascribe this splitting into two factors to describe the “applied calculus”
questions with the fact question C5 had the lowest correct re sponse rate of any of the questions
(Figure 2). Regardless, this analysis is also consistent wi th the presence of three separate
scales - pure calculus questions, applied calculus questio ns, and calculus self-efficacy
questions - existing within the survey.

5/164.2 Survey Results
The results for the calculus proficiency survey and calculu s self-efficacy survey are shown in
Figure 3. In this figure, the average self-efficacy score is calculated by averaging the scores on
the three calculus self-efficacy questions (Figure 1). On a verage, students scoring higher on
the calculus proficiency survey earned higher grades in the course, consistent with previous
work showing a correlation between mathematics ability and student performance in physics
courses [3, 5, 16, 17]. In addition, these data also indicate that students score higher on the
“pure” calculus questions than on the “applied” calculus qu estions. While this result may not
be surprising for the first survey, and perhaps the second su rvey, as the students are still in the
process of learning the associated physics content, it is ne vertheless noteworthy that this trend
persists on the third survey taken at the end of the semester.

Figure 3. Responses to calculus proficiency survey (left panels) and calculus self-efficacy
survey (right panel) disaggregated by course grade. 190 stu dents earned an A (purple), 70
students earned a B (orange), and 33 students earned a C, D, or F (green). Error bars denote the
68% confidence interval of the standard error.
As the data shown in Figure 3 demonstrate that scores on the ca lculus proficiency survey
and calculus self-efficacy survey were dependent on course grade, we next sought to determine
how student identity ( i.e., student gender) modulates the interaction between calcul us
proficiency and calculus self-efficacy by focusing on stud ents earning the same course grade.
The average responses to the surveys by students earning a gr ade of A in General Physics II
(129 men and 61 women) are shown in Figure 4. These data show th at women score higher
than men on the “pure” calculus questions on the calculus pro ficiency survey, with differences
between 1 and 2 pooled standard errors, and that the differen ce between the scores of women
and men increases throughout the semester. Similarly, whil e men score higher than women on
the “applied” calculus questions on the calculus proficien cy survey at the beginning of the
semester, by the end of the semester, women score higher than men on those questions too.
Figure 4 also shows the differences between the average calc ulus self-efficacy scores for men
and women earning an A in General Physics II. While the averag e calculus self-efficacy score
is higher for women than for men at the beginning of the semest er, by the end of the semester,
the situation has reversed. When the data for calculus self- efficacy and calculus proficiency
are combined, we see that as the semester progresses women sc ore ever better than men on
calculus proficiency while scoring ever worse than men on th e calculus self-efficacy. Thus,
these data indicate an inverse relationship between the per ception of calculus proficiency and
6/16the demonstration of calculus proficiency.
It is interesting to note that while the scores on the “applie d” calculus questions increase
throughout the semester, the scores on the “pure” calculus q uestions decrease. Furthermore, as
indicated by the Z-statistics shown in Figure 4, these chang es are not of equal magnitude for
men and women. For the “pure” calculus questions, the averag e score for women decreased
from(89±2)% to(84±3)%, corresponding to a Z-statistic of -1.09, while the average score
for men decreased from (83±2)% to(75±3)%, corresponding to a Z-statistic of -2.31; the
errors indicate the 68% confidence interval for the standar d error. In contrast, for the “applied”
calculus questions, the average score for women increased f rom(13±2)% to(36±4)%,
corresponding to a Z-statistic of 4.74, while the average sc ore for men increased from
(20±2)% to(27±3)%, corresponding to a Z-statistic of 1.92; the errors indicat e the 68%
confidence interval for the standard error. Women thus disp layed a larger improvement in
scores on the “applied” calculus questions and a smaller dec rease in scores on the “pure”
calculus questions when compared to men.

The corresponding Z-statistic for the difference between t he distributions for men and women

To investigate this relationship further, we calculated th e correlation between the average
self-efficacy scores, average “pure” calculus scores, and average “applied” calculus scores for
men and women, separately, for students earning an A in the co urse. These correlation
coefficients are shown in Figure 5 and indicate that the inve rse relationship ( i.e., negative
correlation) between calculus proficiency and calculus se lf-efficacy exist within the population
of women students, but not within the population of men stude nts.

Similar conclusions are found through a principal componen t analysis [20] of these data. The

components were calculated using all matched student respo nses ( i.e., for all students,
regardless of grade earned in the course). The average value s of the first three of these
principal components for men and women earning an A in Genera l Physics II are shown in
Figure 6. The first principal component, Z1, is dominated by the calculus self-efficacy
questions and the “pure” calculus questions with the coeffi cients of all questions having the
same sign (Table 2). The values of Z1 are consistently higher for women than for men (Figure
6) as the difference in calculus self-efficacy between men a nd women is smaller than the
difference in calculus proficiency between men and women. I n other words, the value of Z1 is
consistently larger for women than for men since decreases i n calculus self-efficacy for women
occurring throughout the semester are compensated by conco mitant smaller increases in
calculus proficiency by men.
As shown in Table 2, the coefficients for the contributions o f the calculus questions to the
second principal component, Z2, are all positive while the c oefficients for the contributions
from the calculus self-efficacy questions to Z2 are all nega tive. Thus, the second principal
component of these data represents the anti-correlation be tween student proficiency with
calculus and their calculus self-efficacy. As shown in Figu re 6, the values of this principal
component for men and women diverge over the course of the sem ester with the means of the
populations separated by more than two pulled standard erro rs by the third survey. In light of
the results shown in Figure 4, we understand the origin of thi s divergence between men and
women resulting from women scoring higher than men on the cal culus proficiency survey and
scoring less favorable than men on the calculus self-effica cy survey.
The third principal component, Z3, is dominated by question s from the calculus
proficiency survey with “applied” calculus questions havi ng positive coefficients and “pure”
calculus questions having negative coefficients (Table 2) . Thus, a more positive value of Z3
corresponds to answering the “applied” calculus questions more favorably, the “pure” calculus
questions less favorably, or some combination of both. As sh own in Figure 6, the values of Z3
are initially higher for men than for women, but the differen ce between men and women
decreases steadily throughout the semester as the value of Z 3 for women increases more than
the value of Z3 for men. These changes in Z3 thus reflect the fa ct that women are answering
the “pure” calculus questions and the “applied” questions m ore favorably than men throughout
the semester, with the gap between men and women increasing o ver the semester (Figure 4).
4.4 Network Analysis
The inverse relationship between performance on the “pure” calculus questions and the
“applied” calculus questions on the calculus proficiency s urvey is also clear from network
analysis [7] of the combined results from the calculus profi ciency survey and the calculus
self-efficacy survey. These networks were subsequently sp arsified using previously published
8/16Table 2. The first three principal components for all students in Gen eral Physics II with negative coefficients highlighted in g ray. These principal components
account for 21.7% (Z1), 16.3% (Z2), and 13.3% (Z3) of the tota l variance in the data. For Z2, the signs of the coefficients f or calculus self-efficacy questions
(S1, S2, and S3) are opposite the signs of the “pure” calculus questions (C1, C2, and C3) and the “applied” calculus questi ons (C4, C5, and C6). For Z3, the
signs of the coefficients for the “pure” calculus questions are opposite the signs for the “applied” calculus questions .

methods [7, 12] and the NetworkX package [14] for Python [38] to elucidate the backbone of
the corresponding networks. We employed a significance lev el [7, 12] of 0.3 for these
sparisifications.
As shown in Figure 7, the sparsified networks for all student s earning an A in General
Physics II show a positive correlation exists between respo nses to the “applied” calculus
question (C4, C5, and C6) with the majority of students answe ring those questions incorrectly.
Responses to these questions are inversely correlated with responses to the “pure” calculus
questions (C1, C2, and C3) and the calculus self-efficacy qu estions (S1, S3, and S3). This
inverse correlation between the “pure” calculus questions and the “applied” calculus questions
is also manifest in the third principal component of the data for General Physics II (Table 2).
The modular communities [26], determined using the greedy m odularity maximization
algorithm within the NetworkX package [14], are the same for both networks. The three
communities within each network consist of the “pure” calcu lus questions (C1, C2, and C3),
the “applied” calculus questions (C4, C5, and C6), and the ca lculus self-efficacy questions (S1,
S2, and S3). This result is consistent with the exploratory f actor analysis discussed above and
provides further support that three separate scales - pure c alculus questions, applied calculus
questions, and calculus self-efficacy questions - exist wi thin the survey.

5 Discussion
The increase in correct responses to the “applied” calculus questions over the course of the
semester is consistent with the answer to RQ1 being that the e mphasis on calculus in this
course may be helping students with their ability with “appl ied” calculus. Furthermore, the
differences observed in student proficiency answering “pu re” calculus and “applied” calculus
questions shown in Figure 3 and Figure 2 is consistent with st udent difficulty in
mathematization within physics and/or mathematics transf er to physics. In that context, the
results presented here are consistent with previous work de monstrating that such transfer is
difficult [4, 6, 25, 29], while also indicating that student identity ( i.e., gender) may influence
transfer proficiency.
In response to RQ2, the data presented here demonstrate that student perception of calculus
ability ( i.e., calculus self-efficacy) and student proficiency with cal culus is inversely correlated
for women, but not for men. This relationship stems, at least in part, from the fact that while
men experience very little change in their calculus self-ef ficacy over the course of the semester
(a Z-statistic of 0.39 for the change from survey 1 to survey 3 for students earning an A in the
course), women experience a significant decrease in their c alculus self-efficacy over the same
period (a Z-statistic of -1.72 for the change from survey 1 to survey 3 for students earning an A
in the course). Thus, even though proficiency with the “appl ied” calculus questions increases
more for women (Z-statistic of 4.74 for the change from surve y 1 to survey 3) than for men
(Z-statistic of 1.92 for the change from survey 1 to survey 2) , women nevertheless perceive
their proficiency to decrease. Thus, while an emphasis on ca lculus in this course may help
students improve their proficiency with applied calculus, this emphasis does not appear to
impact the calculus self-efficacy of men and negatively imp acts the calculus self-efficacy of
women.
5.1 Correlation With Physics Self-Efficacy
Our observation of a gender imbalance in calculus self-effi cacy is consistent with the results of
previously reported studies of mathematics self-efficacy [15, 31]. Furthermore, the disconnect
between calculus self-efficacy and calculus proficiency i s reminiscent of previous studies
showing a gender-dependent disconnect between physics sel f-efficacy and physics proficiency
(using course grade as a proxy for proficiency)[8, 23, 27]. F or example, Marshman et al.
showed that women had lower physics self-efficacy compared to that of similarly performing
11/16men [23].
To explore this further, we compared the changes in physics s elf-efficacy to changes in
calculus self-efficacy. Physics self-efficacy was assess ed using the instrument previously
developed by Marshman et al. [23]. This multiple choice survey consists of six questions , each
of which involved 4-point Likert scales, with higher scores indicating higher levels of
self-efficacy. A single physics self-efficacy score for ea ch student is determined by averaging
the scores for the six questions. Students completed the ass essment at the beginning, in the
middle, and at the end of the semester concomitant with compl eting the other surveys
described above.

efficacy (squares) for students earning an A in the course. R ight Panel: Correlation between
physics self-efficacy and calculus self-efficacy for stud ents earning an A in the course. The
three data points for each cohort correspond to the three dep loyments of the surveys.
The normalized gains in the calculus-self efficacy and phys ics self-efficacy of students
earning an A in the course are shown in Figure 8. For women, the changes in physics
self-efficacy and calculus self-efficacy track with one an other, possibly suggesting that
whatever experiences and/or influences are affected one tr ait are also affecting the other. The
situation is different for men, however, where the trajecto ries of changes in physics
self-efficacy and calculus self-efficacy do not overlap. F urthermore, since the changes in
physics self-efficacy for men are well aligned with the chan ges in physics self-efficacy and
calculus self-efficacy for women, these data suggest that t he trends in calculus self-efficacy for
men are the outlier. One possible explanation for this resul t is that men react to difficulties
using calculus in the course differently from how women do. F or example, men may not
associate making mistakes using calculus with a lack of prof iciency. Indeed, their self-efficacy
may not decrease if they perceive that other students are als o struggling to use calculus since
they could associate the making of mistakes as being common i n physics courses and thus
somehow not a reflection of their intrinsic proficiency wit h calculus. That women would react
differently to making mistakes using calculus in a physics c ourse could be related to how their
perception of success and belonging in that course are influ enced by being a member of an
underrepresented group in the course and the implicit and/o r explicit stereotype threats
associated with that status [21, 22].
Our observation that the correlation between physics self- efficacy and calculus
self-efficacy is weaker for men than for women (Figure 8), ma y also suggest that men perceive
the role of calculus in the physics course differently than w omen do. If so, perhaps such
differing views of the role of calculus in physics might be as sociated not only with the
differences in correlation shown in Figure 8, but also with d ifferences in improvement in
applied calculus skills ( i.e., calculus transfer to physics) during the semester.
12/165.2 Limitations
While the conclusion that these data demonstrate gender-me diated correlations between
calculus proficiency and calculus self-efficacy, it is imp ortant to note the limitations of this
work. First, the surveys employed in this project were all ad ministered online owing partly to
limitations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. It is po ssible that students were not
engaged with the surveys, particularly the calculus profic iency survey, as earnestly online as
they would have been in-person. Related to that is the possib ility that the preparation obtained
by the students in this study in their previously taken calcu lus courses was affected by those
courses being taught online or with a modified curriculum du e to pandemic-associated
accommodations.
Second, that fewer than 40% of the students were answering th e “applied” calculus
questions correctly on the calculus proficiency survey (Fi gure 3 and Figure 2) may suggest that
some of these questions are too difficult or otherwise not ab le to provide the dynamic range
necessary to evaluate student proficiency with using calcu lus in a physics context.
5.3 Future Work
The next step in this project is the further refinement of the calculus proficiency survey. In
addition to potential modification of the questions asked, we would also welcome
collaborating with other institutions as that would provid e an opportunity to collect data from a
larger population of students and potentially a wider distr ibution of demographics, as well as
students completing different physics curricula where exp ectations for calculus usage may be
different. Such data would also allow us to examine how other dimensions of student identity
intersect with calculus proficiency and calculus self-eff icacy, as well as the correlation
between physics self-efficacy and calculus self-efficacy .
We also intend to coordinate with instructors in other depar tments to deploy similar
surveys of calculus self-efficacy, discipline-specific c alculus proficiency, and discipline
self-efficacy in their courses. Data collected from such su rveys can help us identify the extend
to which the results presented here are specific to introduc tory physics. We similarly need to
develop and deploy a calculus proficiency survey for Genera l Physics I so that we can identify
how early this divergence between calculus self-efficacy a nd calculus proficiency occurs.
6 Conclusion
Since applied mathematics is an important component of all S TEM disciplines, there is a clear
need to promote student competency with mathematical skill s across all STEM curricula.
Introductory physics courses are the ideal venue for improv ing fluency with applied
mathematics as their curricula emphasize quantitative pro blem solving skills. Providing
opportunities to improve calculus fluency and transfer ski lls will likely have the largest benefit
for students with weaker secondary mathematics preparatio n [19], such as students from
traditionally underserved populations [1, 35], who are als o at a higher risk of dropping out of
STEM degree programs [24, 37, 41]. Improving calculus profi ciency and transfer ability thus
has the potential to improve the retention of these students in these programs and thereby
increase the diversity within STEM disciplines and careers . Similarly, understanding the
origins of differences in calculus self-efficacy and the in terplay between those differences and
variation in calculus proficiency will assist in the develo pment and assessment of curriculum
changes and other interventions targeting improvements in these attributes. This has the
potential to help reduce the imbalances in physics self-eff icacy [23, 27], leading to an
increased participation and retention of traditionally un derrepresented students within STEM
and, by extension, in the STEM workforce.
