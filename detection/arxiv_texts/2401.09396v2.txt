KATERINA SANTICOLA
Abstract. Given a smooth curve C/slash.leftQwith genus≥2, we know by Faltings’
Theorem that C(Q)is ﬁnite. Here we ask the reverse question: given a ﬁnite
set of rational points S⊆Pn(Q), does there exist a smooth curve C/slash.leftQcon-
tained in Pnsuch that C(Q)=S? We answer this question in the aﬃrmative
by providing an eﬀective algorithm for constructing such a c urve.
1.Introduction
The genus gof a smooth projective curve C/slash.leftQdetermines the possibilities for
its set of rational points. If g=0, thenC(Q)=∅ orC(Q)is inﬁnite. If g=1, then
C(Q)=∅, or by the Mordell–Weil theorem, the set C(Q)can be given the structure
of a ﬁnitely generated abelian group. Mazur’s torsion theor em [10] restricts the
possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves. As a consequ ence, for example, there
are no genus 1curvesC/slash.leftQwith exactly 11rational points. For g≥2, Faltings’
theorem [ 3] asserts that C(Q)is ﬁnite. The Uniformity conjecture of Caporaso,
Harris, and Mazur [ 2], predicts that #C(Q)is uniformly bounded as Cranges
through curves C/slash.leftQof ﬁxed genus g≥2.
It is therefore natural to ask about the possible restrictio ns on#C(Q)asC
ranges through all curves C/slash.leftQof all possible genera g≥2. Poonen [ 11] has shown
that every value of #C(Q)is possible1. In this paper, we show that there are no
restrictions on the set C(Q)itself, beyond ﬁniteness.
Theorem 1. Letn≥2. Given any ﬁnite set of rational points S⊂Pn(Q), there
exists a smooth projective curve C/slash.leftQcontained in Pn, of genus g≥2, such that
C(Q)=S.
Our proof gives an eﬀective algorithm for computing the curv eCfrom the given
set of rational points S. It builds on earlier constructions due to Gajović [ 4] and
the current author [ 12]. LetPRdenote the perfect powers of the ring R:
PR={am∶a∈R,m≥2}.
They show that for a ﬁnite set of perfect powers S⊂PR, forR=ZandR=Q
respectively, there is a polynomial fS(X)∈Z[X]such that fS(X)∩PR=S. We
will show how the construction of the polynomial fSin those papers can be adapted
to give a construction of a suitable curve Cin our context.

2.Superelliptic Curves
The proof of Theorem 1involves constructing suitable ’superelliptic’ curves, a nd
then gluing them together. By a superelliptic curve CoverQ[5] we mean a smooth
projective curve in P2associated to the aﬃne model given by
C∶ym=f(x),
wherefis separable of degree d≥3andm≥2is an integer. If m=2andd=3then
Cis an elliptic curve, whereas if m=2andd≥5thenCis hyperelliptic. When
m=d, the genus gof the curve is g=(d−1)(d−2)/slash.left2; thus ifd≥4, theng≥2and
soC(Q)is ﬁnite by Faltings’ theorem [ 3].
We begin by assuming our prescribed set of points Ssatisﬁes some nice condi-
tions.
Deﬁnition 1. LetS={(a1,b1),...,(ar,br)}⊂A2(Q)be a ﬁnite set of distinct
rational points in the aﬃne plane. We say that Sisacceptable if the following
conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) ifai=ajthenbi=bj,
(ii)ai,bj≠0for alli,j,
(iii)ai,bj∈Zfor alli,j.
For any such S, we can construct a superelliptic curve Cwhose set of aﬃne
rational points is exactly S, and such that Chas no rational points at inﬁnity. In
Section 6, we will show how to extend the argument to sets in Pn(Q).
Theorem 2. Given an acceptable set S⊂A2(Q), and a ﬁnite subset B⊂C, there
exists a separable polynomial fS,B(X)∈Q[X]of some degree d≥4, not vanishing
at any point inB, such that C(Q)=S, whereCis the superelliptic curve associated
to the aﬃne model
C∶yd=fS,B(X).
Our general argument will not apply to the case when the set of prescribed points
Shas size/divides.alt0S/divides.alt0=1. In this case, we can take any curve C/slash.leftQof genus g≥2with
one rational point. A suitable change of coordinates will se nd the point in Sto the
point on C. For instance, take the hyperelliptic curve over Qwith aﬃne model
C∶y2=x5−2.
We verify in Magma [ 1] that the rational points on the Jacobian, J(Q), form a
group of rank 0 with trivial torsion subgroup. Since C(Q)injects into J(Q), we
conclude that Chas no rational points other than the one at inﬁnity.
From now on we assume that S={(a1,b1),...,(ar,br)}is acceptable and /divides.alt0S/divides.alt0=
r>1. Set
d=18r+3,
and let
m∶=r
/product.disp
j<k(aj−ak).
LetL(X)∈Q[X]be the Lagrange interpolation polynomial passing through t he
pointsS′, where
S′={(ai,bd
i)/divides.alt0(ai,bi)∈S},3
which is of the form
L(X)=r
/summation.disp
j=1bd
j/product.disp
0≤k≤r
k≠jX−ak
aj−ak.
Lemma 3. LetS={(a1,b1),...,(ar,br)}be an acceptable set of points of size
/divides.alt0S/divides.alt0=r. Letnbe any integer such that n≥r. Then there exists an irreducible
polynomial
h(X)=n
/summation.disp
i=1αiXi∈Q[X]
satisfying the following conditions
(i)h(ai)=bd
ifor all(ai,bi)∈S,
(ii)h(X)has degree n,
(iii)m⋅h(X)∈Z[X].
Proof of Lemma 3.Let
b(X)=r
/product.disp
i=1(X−ai)∈Z[X].
SinceSis acceptable, bj≠0for allj, soL(X)andb(X)are coprime. Choose
c(X)∈Z[X]to be monic and coprime to L(X)of degree n−r, and let
R(X,Y)=L(X)+b(X)c(X)Y∈Q(Y)[X].
This is irreducible in Q(Y)[X]. By Hilbert’s irreducibility theorem [ 13], there is
a thin set A⊂P1(Q)such that if t∉A, thenR(X,t)is irreducible over Q. It
follows that there exist inﬁnitely many integers y∉A. Choose any such yand let
h(X)=R(X,y). Thenh(X)will satisfy the conditions above. /square
Although the polynomial h(X)interpolates the points of S, we cannot be sure
that its associated superelliptic curve does not have other rational points. Our
approach will be to build, from h(X), a superelliptic curve C/slash.leftQof degree dsuch
that all rational points on Cmap to the rational points of an elliptic curve E/slash.leftQ.
This elliptic curve will be chosen to have rank 0, and this wil l allow us to conclude
there are no other rational points on C.
3.Twists of the Mordell curve
LetEbe an elliptic curve over Q. Letrkdenote its Mordell-Weil rank, so that
E(Q)≅E(Q)tors×Zrk. LetEkdenote the quadratic twist of EbyQ(√
k). A
celebrated conjecture of Goldfeld’s predicts that as kvaries, the rank should be 0
half of the time, and 1 the other half. Namely,
Conjecture 4 (Goldfeld) .[6]LetEkbe the quadratic twist of Ebyk. Then
lim
X→∞∑/divides.alt0k/divides.alt0<Xrk(Ek)
#{k∶/divides.alt0k/divides.alt0<X}=1
2.
In our construction, we will relate the rational points on ou r superelliptic curve
to the rational points on a quadratic twist Epof the Mordell curve Eby a prime
p, where
E∶Y2=X3−1,
and
Ep∶pY2=X3−1.4 KATERINA SANTICOLA
We want to choose pso thatrk(Ep)=0. Juyal, Moody and Roy [ 9] use the
technique of 2-descent to show it is suﬃcient to choose p≡5 mod 12 .
Theorem 5. [9]LetE∶Y2=X3−1be the Mordell curve, and let
Ep∶pY2=X3−1
denote its twist by a prime p. Then for all primes p≡5 mod 12 , we have
Ep(Q)≅{(1,0),∞}.
4.Choosing a prime
We continue with our construction of fS,B. Apply Lemma 3withn=6r+3to
produce h(X)of degree n. Let
N∶=/product.disp
vp(m)>0p.
WithS={(a1,b1),...,(ar,br)}as before, let
g(X,t)=tN6r
/product.disp
i=1(X−ai)6+1∈Q[X,t].
Proposition 6. Letg(X,t)as above. Given a ﬁnite set of values B⊂C, the zeroes
ofg(X,t0)lie outside ofBfor all but ﬁnitely many values of t0∈C.
Proof. Everyα∈Bis a root of g(X,t0)for exactly one value t0∈C. /square
Lemma 7. Letg(X,t)as above. For all but ﬁnitely many primes p,
(h(X)−1)g(X,p)+1
is separable.
Proof. First, because h(X)is irreducible, its discriminant is non-zero and has ﬁ-
nite support. For those primes pnot dividing the discriminant, h(X)is separable
modulop. Now rewrite the polynomial (h(X)−1)g(X,t)+1as
(2)(h(X)−1)g(X,t)+1=h(X)+tH(X)=6r+n
/summation.disp
i=0ciXi.
whereH(X)is some polynomial in Q[X]. For all but ﬁnitely many values of p, we
can specialise g(X,t)att=pso that the valuations of the coeﬃcients are:
vp(ci)=⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩0 0≤i≤n,
1n+1≤i≤6r+n.
Thus the Newton polygon of the polynomial ( 2) consists of two segments of lengths
nand6rand slopes 0and1/slash.left6rrespectively. By the theory of Newton polygons,
[7, 7.2.3] ( 2) will factor as the product of two irreducible polynomials i nZp[X]:
(h(X)−1)g(X,p)+1=F1(X)F2(X)
corresponding to the two line segments of the Newton polygon . HereF1(X)has
degreenand its roots have valuation 0, andF2(X)has degree 6rand its roots have
valuation 1/slash.left6r. In particular, F1,F2are coprime. Moreover, F1≡h(X)modp.
However h(X)is separable modulo p, and thus F1is separable in Zp[X], for all
but ﬁnitely many p. The second factor F2is irreducible because it is pure of slope
1/slash.left6r. This means their product F1(X)F2(X)is separable for all but ﬁnitely many
primesp. /square5
With all of this in mind, we will choose a prime ℓthat satisﬁes a list of conditions.
Proposition 8. Given a ﬁnite set B⊂C, we can choose a prime ℓsuch that
(i) the zeroes of g(X,ℓ)lie outside ofB,
(ii)(h(X)−1)g(X,ℓ)+1is separable,
(iii)(ℓ,N)=1,
(iv)ℓ≡5 mod 12 .
Proof. This is always possible by Proposition 6, Lemma 7and Dirichlet’s theorem.
/square
5.Proof of Theorem 2
Letℓbe a prime chosen as in Proposition 8. Let
g(X)∶=g(X,ℓ).
Let
fS,B(X)∶=g(X)(h(X)−1)g(X)+1),
and let
C∶yd=fS,B(X).
We note that
fS,B(ai)=h(ai)=bd
i
as required. Moreover,
d=degfS,B(X)=2degg(X)+degh(X)=3(6r+1).
Note that the leading coeﬃcient of fS,B(X)is such that
vℓ(ad)=2,
therefore there are no rational points at inﬁnity.
Proposition 9. The curve C∶yd=fS,B(X)is smooth.
Proof. We verify that fS,B(X)is separable. Note that g(X)and(h(X)−1)g(X)+1
are coprime in Q[X], so it is enough to show that each is separable. We have shown
the latter is separable in Lemma 7, andg(X)is irreducible by examining the Newton
polygon with respect to vℓ. /square
Now that we have shown the curve is smooth, we want to show its s et of rational
points is exactly S. So, we want to show that if fS,B(x)=ydfor some x,y∈Q, then
(x,y)∈S.
Proposition 10. If(x,y)∈C, theng(x)=β3for some β∈Q∗.
Proof. Suppose
fS,B(x)=yd
for some x,y∈Q. First, let pbe a prime such that p≠ℓ. Assume vp(x)<0. As the
aiare all integral, we have ∑vp(x−ai)=rvp(x). As0≤vp(ℓN)≤1andr>1, this
meansvp(g(x))<0. Then
vp(g(x))=vp(ℓ)+6vp(N)+6r
/summation.disp
i=0vp(x−ai)=6vp(N)+6rvp(x)≡0 mod 3 .
Now, let pbe a prime such that vp(g(x))≥0. By the above, we must have that
vp(x)≥0. Moreover, if vp(m)>0thenvp(g(x))=0by our choice of N. Now,6 KATERINA SANTICOLA
assumevp(g(x))>0. We have that vp(h(x))=vp(mh(x)). Sincevp(x)≥0and
mh(X)∈Z[X], we have that vp(mh(x))≥0. From this we conclude that
vp((h(x)−1)g(x)+1)=0.
Therefore vp(g(x))≡0 modd, and since 3/divides.alt0dwe are done.
Now, consider vℓ(g(x)). Ifvℓ(x)>0, thenvℓ(g(x))=0. Ifvℓ(x)<0, then
vl(h(x)−1)=nvℓ(x),
becausevℓ(αn)=0, whereαnis the leading coeﬃcient of h(X)(this follows from
the proof of Lemma 7). As before we have that vℓ(g(x))=1+6rvℓ(x), and so
vℓ(g(x)((h(x)−1)g(x)+1))=2+dvℓ(x)≡0 modd,
which is not possible. So, vℓ(g(x))=0. /square
Lemma 11. The polynomial fS,B(X)has no rational roots.
Proof of Lemma 11.Note that g(x)=0is not possible since g(x)>0, so we must
have that(h(x)−1)g(x)+1=0, and
vp(h(x)−1)+vp(g(x))=0.
Ifvp(g(x))>0, then as in the proof of Proposition 10, we have vp(h(x)−1)≥0.
So for all pwe have vp(g)≤0andvp(x)≤0. This means vp(h(x)−1)≥0for allp,
and therefore h(x)−1∈Z. Then, as(h(x)−1)g(x)=−1, we must have g(x)=1, so
x=aifor some i. SinceSis acceptable, and fS,B(ai)=bd
i, we reach a contradiction.
/square
Proof of Theorem 2.Recall that we supposed that fS,B(x)=ydfor some rational
y. To complete the proof of Theorem 2, we want to show that x=aifor some i.
Lemma 11establishes this if fS,B(x)=0. Thus we may suppose fS,B(x)≠0. From
Proposition 10, we see that g(x)=β3for some β∈Q∗. So, we have a point on the
twist of the Mordell curve
(3) Eℓ∶ℓY2=X3−1,
withX≠0, andℓ≡5 mod 12 . By Theorem 5,Eℓ(Q)={(1,0),∞}, and we
conclude that(X,Y)=(1,0). Therefore g(x)=1andx=aifor some i. Then
fS,B(x)=fS,B(ai)=bd
i,
and since dis odd, we conclude that y=bi.
/square
6.Proof of Theorem 1
We have shown that given an acceptable set S⊂A2(Q), and a ﬁnite subset
B⊂C, there exists a separable polynomial fS,B(X)∈Q[X]of some degree d≥4,
not vanishing at any point in B, such that its associated superelliptic curve has
rational point set C(Q)=S. In this section, we show how we can generalise this to
sets inP2(Q), and glue together the superelliptic curves to generalise t he result to
ﬁnite sets in Pn(Q).
Remark 12.If, in the statement of Theorem 1, we had not asked that Cbe a
projective curve, then one could simply use Bertini’s theor em [8] to ﬁnd a smooth
curveCof large genus passing through all points of S. Then, by taking hyperplane
sections, remove from Cthe ﬁnitely many points outside of S.7
Lemma 13. LetS={P1,...,P r}⊆An(Q)be a ﬁnite set of points, which are
distinct and non-zero. Then there exists a change of coordin ate matrix A∈GLn(Q)
such that
(a) for all i,j, we have xi(APj)≠0,
(b) for all i,j,k,ℓwithi≠korj≠ℓ, we have xi(APj)≠xk(APℓ).
where the xiare the usual coordinate functions.
Proof. We write Mn×nfor the aﬃne space of dimension n2considered as the space
ofn×nmatrices. Consider the following subvarieties of Mn×n:
●U={A∈Mn×n∶det(A)=0},
●Vi,j={A∈Mn×n∶xi(APj)=0}with1≤i≤nand1≤j≤r,
●Wi,j,k,ℓ={A∈Mn×n∶xi(APj)=xk(APℓ)}with1≤i,k≤nand1≤j,ℓ≤r
and either i≠korj≠ℓ.
It is easy to see that these are all proper subsets of Mn×nwhich are closed in the
Zariski topology. As the rational points on Mn×nare Zariski dense, it follows that
there is some A∈Mn×n(Q)that does not lie on any of the U,Vi,j,Wi,j,k,ℓ.
/square
Using Lemma 13, we are able to deduce Theorem 1from Theorem 2.
Proof of Theorem 1.LetSbe the ﬁnite set of rational points in Pn(Q). By ﬁnite-
ness of this set, we can always ﬁnd a hyperplane on which none o f the points lie.
After a suitable change of coordinates, all the points lie in an aﬃne chart. We may
assume from Lemma 13that the set S={P1,...,P r}satisﬁes the conclusion of
Lemma 13, scaling the points if necessary to ensure integrality.
For2≤j≤n, let
Sj={(x1(P1),xj(P1)),(x1(P2),xj(P2)), ... ,(x1(Pr),xj(Pr))}⊂A2(Q).
Observe that these are acceptable sets. We construct sequen ces of ﬁnite subsets of
C:
B2⊂B3⊂⋯⊂Bn
and a sequence of separable polynomials f2,f3,...,f n∈Q[x1]as follows. We start
by letting B2=∅. We let f2=fS2,B2constructed as in Theorem 2. For the
inductive step of the construction, let Bjbe the union of Bj−1and the set of
complex roots of fj−1, and we let fj=fSj,Bj. LetC⊂Pnbe the projective closure
of the aﬃne variety
C=V/parenleft.alt1xd
2−f2(x1), xd
3−f3(x1),⋯, xd
n−fn(x1)/parenright.alt1⊂An.
Note that Chas function ﬁeld
Q(C)=Q/parenleft.alt2d/radical.alt1
f2(X),d/radical.alt1
f3(X),...,d/radical.alt1
fn(X)/parenright.alt2
which is a ﬁnite extension of Q(X). ThusCis an absolutely irreducible curve. It
follows from Theorem 2thatC(Q)={P1,P2,...,P r}. Moreover, we note that the
construction ensures that f1,...,f nhave pairwise distinct complex roots. It follows
from this, using the Jacobian criterion, that the curve Cis smooth.
