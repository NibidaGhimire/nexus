ABSTRACT
Aims. We present the first multi-wavelength study of Mrk 501 including very-high-energy (VHE) γ-ray observations simultaneous to X-ray
polarization measurements from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer ( IXPE ).
Methods. We use radio-to-VHE data from a multi-wavelength campaign organized between 2022-03-01 and 2022-07-19 (MJD 59639 to
MJD 59779). The observations were performed by MAGIC, Fermi -LAT, NuSTAR ,Swift (XRT and UVOT), and several instruments covering
the optical and radio bands to complement the IXPE pointings. We characterize the dynamics of the broad-band emission around the X-ray polar-
ization measurements through its multi-band fractional variability and correlations, and compare changes observed in the polarization degree to
changes seen in the broad-band emission using a multi-zone leptonic scenario.
Results. During the IXPE pointings, the VHE state is close to the average behavior with a 0.2-1 TeV flux of 20% - 50% the emission of the
Crab Nebula. Additionally, it shows low variability and a hint of correlation between VHE and X-rays. Despite the average VHE activity, an
extreme X-ray behavior is measured for the first two IXPE pointings in March 2022 (MJD 59646 to 59648 and MJD 59665 to 59667) with a
synchrotron peak frequency >1 keV . For the third IXPE pointing in July 2022 (MJD 59769 to 59772), the synchrotron peak shifts towards lower
energies and the optical /X-ray polarization degrees drop. All three IXPE epochs show an atypically low Compton dominance in the γ-rays. The
X-ray polarization is systematically higher than at lower energies, suggesting an energy-stratification of the jet. While during the IXPE epochs the
polarization angle in the X-ray, optical and radio bands align well, we find a clear discrepancy in the optical and radio polarization angles in the
middle of the campaign. Such results further strengthen the hypothesis of an energy-stratified jet. We model the broad-band spectra simultaneous
to the IXPE pointings assuming a compact zone dominating in the X-rays and VHE, and an extended zone stretching further downstream the jet
dominating the emission at lower energies. NuSTAR data allow us to precisely constrain the synchrotron peak and therefore the underlying electron
distribution. The change between the di fferent states observed in the three IXPE pointings can be explained by a change of magnetization and /or
emission region size, which directly connects the shift of the synchrotron peak to lower energies with the drop in polarization degree.

1. Introduction
Blazars are among the brightest objects in the γ-ray sky and are
known to emit radiation over a broad range of wavebands from
radio up to the very-high-energy (VHE; >0.1 TeV) regime. They
are jetted active galactic nuclei AGNs with a small angle be-
tween our line of sight and the jet axis.
Even though blazars have been observed for decades across
the entire electromagnetic spectrum, their main acceleration and
emission mechanisms are still debated. Polarization measure-
ments in the di fferent wavebands could distinguish between dif-
ferent emission mechanisms (Zhang & Böttcher 2013) or allow
properties such as the underlying acceleration mechanisms or
the magnetic field configurations to be probed (Tavecchio et al.
2018; Tavecchio 2021). Up to recently, polarization measure-
ments of blazars have only been possible in the radio to opti-
cal bands. However, these bands are known for originating from
more extended or multiple regions in the jet compared to the
high-energy emission or are contaminated by the host galaxy
(see e.g., Acciari et al. 2020). In December 2021, the Imag-
ing X-ray Polarimetry Explorer ( IXPE ) (Weisskopf 2022) was
launched with the goal of measuring linear polarization in the
2–8 keV band for various sources.
For the first time, the detection of X-ray polarization of the
archetypal blazar Markarian 501 (Mrk 501; z =0.034, Ulrich et al.
1975) was published by Liodakis et al. (2022). Mrk 501 is one
of our closest and brightest blazars and therefore a prime object
to explore new observational techniques. As usual for blazars,
its spectral energy distribution (SED) depicts two peaks. The
low-energy peak can be attributed to synchrotron radiation of
relativistic electrons inside the magnetized plasma of the jet.
It is used to classify blazars and Mrk 501 usually is attributed
to the class of high synchrotron peaked blazars (HSPs) with a
synchrotron peak frequency νs>1015Hz (Abdo et al. 2010).
However, it has also shown extreme HSP (EHSP) behavior with
νs≥2.4×1017Hz (∼1 keV) (Costamante et al. 2001; Abdo
et al. 2010) during extended periods of time encompassing both
flaring and non-flaring activity (Ahnen et al. 2018; Furniss et al.
2015). The origin of the high-energy peak is less clear. It could
either originate from electron inverse-Compton scattering o ff
low-energy photons (leptonic scenarios; see, e.g., Maraschi et al.
1992; Ghisellini & Maraschi 1996; Tavecchio et al. 1998) or
could be induced by relativistic protons inside the jet sparking
different cascades or hadronic synchrotron radiation (hadronic
scenarios; see, e.g., Mannheim 1993; Aharonian 2000; Mücke
& Protheroe 2001).
For Mrk 501, the IXPE energy range covers either the falling
part, during its usual HSP states, or the peak, during EHSP be-
havior, of the synchrotron bump. IXPE thus probes the emission
from the most energetic electrons freshly accelerated in the jet.
The first X-ray polarization measurements of Mrk 501 were
conducted during two pointings from 2022-03-08 to 2022-03-10
and 2022-03-27 to 2022-03-29 (MJD 59646 to 59648 and MJD
59665 to 59667). In what follows, those two periods will be re-
ferred to as IXPE -1 and IXPE -2. They revealed a polarization
degree in the 2–8 keV band of ∼10% that is a factor of two
higher than in the optical regime (Liodakis et al. 2022). Addi-
tionally, the polarization angle was found to be aligned with the
radio jet. All those properties point towards shocks being the
prime acceleration mechanism, as well as an energy stratified
jet where the most energetic particles emit from a region which
is magnetically more ordered and closer to the acceleration site

D. Paneque. E-mail: contact.magic@mpp.mpg.de(Liodakis et al. 2022; Angelakis et al. 2016). These energetic
particles subsequently cool and stream away from the shock to
populate broader regions. An additional IXPE pointing was con-
ducted from 2022-07-09 to 2022-07-12 (MJD 59769 to 59772)
revealing a drop in polarization degree to ∼7%, but with a stable
polarization angle compared to the March measurement (Lisalda
2023). This observing epoch is dubbed as IXPE -3 throughout the
rest of this paper.
In this work, we present the multi-wavelength (MWL) pic-
ture around these three X-ray polarization measurements, in-
cluding, for the first time, also data up to the VHE regime
taken by the Florian Goebel Major Atmospheric Gamma Imag-
ing Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes. To characterize the high-
energy emission in detail, the campaign involved instruments
such as the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) , and the
Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) in the X-
rays, and the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi ) in the high-energy γ-rays.
Both the IXPE pointings as well as the whole time epoch from
2022-03-01 to 2022-07-19 (MJD 59639 to MJD 59779) were ac-
companied by extensive multi-wavelength coverage from radio
to VHE, which is summarized in the following sections.
This paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we describe
all instruments involved together with their dedicated data anal-
ysis methods. Section 3 provides a detailed characterization of
the MWL emission during the three IXPE observations, includ-
ing the di fferent flux states, spectral behaviors and polarization.
The MWL characteristics of the full campaign are then summa-
rized in Section 4. Section 5 presents a theoretical modeling of
the three IXPE time epochs using a two-zone leptonic model.
Finally, Section 6 summarizes and discusses the MWL results
together with the obtained theoretical models.
2. Observations and analysis
A multitude of observations from VHE to radio were performed
to investigate the full MWL behavior of Mrk 501 around the first
IXPE observations. These were conducted in the framework of
the extensive multi-instrument campaigns organized since 2008
for Mrk 501 (Aleksi ´c et al. 2015a) and are stretching from 2022-
03-01 to 2022-07-19 (MJD 59639 to MJD 59779) with the in-
struments and analyses summarized in this section.
2.1. MAGIC
MAGIC is a stereoscopic system of two imaging air cherenkov
telescopes (IACTs) located at the Roque de los Muchachos Ob-
servatory, on the Canary island of La Palma at 2243 m above sea
level. MAGIC covers an energy range between tens of GeVs to
tens of TeVs and has a sensitivity above 100 GeV (300 GeV)
of about 2% (about 1%) of the Crab Nebula flux at low zenith
angles (<30◦) after 25 h of observations (see Fig. 19 of Alek-
si´c et al. 2016), which makes it well suited to perform blazar
observations in the VHE range.
Covering the time period around the first three IXPE point-
ings, MAGIC observed Mrk 501 for around 38 hours from 2022-
03-01 to 2022-07-19 (MJD 59639 to MJD 59779), which re-
sults in 26.5 hours after data selection cuts based on atmospheric
transmission. The data are analyzed using the MARS (MAGIC
Analysis and Reconstruction Software) package (Zanin et al.
2013; Aleksi ´c et al. 2016).
The VHE flux light curve (LC) is computed for the full en-
ergy range above 0.2 TeV , as well as for a low-energy range of

0.2-1 TeV and a high-energy range above 1 TeV as shown in the
top panel of Figure 1 using nightly bins. For the bins showing a
significance of less than 2 σ, upper limits (ULs) are computed ac-
cording to the Rolke method (Rolke et al. 2005) with 95% con-
fidence. The spectral parameters around the three IXPE point-
ings are determined using a forward folding method assuming a
power-law model, which provides a good description of the data
(see Table 1). For the IXPE -1 and IXPE -2 spectra, the Tikhonov
unfolding method is applied to compute the spectral data points
(Albert et al. 2007), while for the IXPE -3 spectrum again the for-
ward folding method is used due to limited statistics. We checked
the preference of a log parabola over a simple power-law model
for each spectrum using a likelihood ratio test, but no signifi-
cant (>3σ) preference is found. Extragalactic background light
(EBL) absorption is corrected for using the model of Domínguez
et al. (2011).
2.2. Fermi-LAT
The LAT is a pair conversion instrument on board Fermi , which
operates in the high-energy regime and is sensitive to an energy
range from 20 MeV to beyond 300 GeV . It covers the entire sky
every 3 hours (Atwood et al. 2009; Ackermann et al. 2012).
To analyze the LAT data, we use the unbinned-likelihood
tools from the FERMITOOLS software package1(v2.0.8). We
employ P8R3_SOURCE_V3_v1 as the instrument response func-
tion, gll_iem_v07 &iso_P8R3_SOURCE_V3_v1 as the di ffuse
background2and use the event class of 128, considering events
that interacted in the front and back sections of the tracker (i.e.
evtype =3). The radius of the region of interest (ROI) is set to
10◦and the maximum zenith to 100◦because of the chosen en-
ergy range. We chose a higher minimum energy than is conven-
tionally chosen (0.3 GeV instead of 0.1 GeV) to ensure a better
angular resolution (2 deg for the 68% containment for photons
above 0.3 GeV compared to 5 deg for photons above 0.1 GeV),
which leads to an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio since
the analysis is less a ffected by di ffuse backgrounds or potential
(transient) non-accounted neighbouring sources. This is possi-
ble owing to the hard-spectrum of Mrk 501 because the reduc-
tion of detected photons due to the higher threshold is relatively
small. For the maximum energy, we chose a value of 500 GeV
that allows an overlap with the MAGIC energy range when re-
constructing spectra.
To build a model, we use the fourth Fermi -LAT source cata-
log (4FGL-DL3; Abdollahi et al. 2022) using all sources within
the ROI plus an annulus of 5◦. The obtained model is then
fit to the data set in the time range 2022-03-01 to 2022-07-19
(MJD 59639 to MJD 59779). Subsequently, very weak compo-
nents with a test statistic (TS; Mattox et al. 1996) below 3 are re-
moved from the model as well as those with an expected source
count below 1. We then divide the data set in 20 bins of 7-day
duration, and redo the fit in each bin varying only the normaliza-
tion of the di ffuse backgrounds, and that of sources within <3◦
and a detection with TS >10. Furthermore, we allow the spec-
tral parameters of Mrk 501 to vary assuming a power-law shape.
To evaluate the impact of very variable sources in our ROI, we
conducted the same analysis freeing the normalization and spec-
tral indices of all very-variable sources (variability index >100).
Both analysis agree within the statistical uncertainties. In addi-
tion, spectral analyses are performed for 2 week intervals cen-
1https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/
2http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/
\BackgroundModels.htmltered around each of the three IXPE observations. The same
ROI model and approach as before is applied. For each spec-
trum, we computed the likelihood ratio between a power-law and
log parabolic power-law model. No significant ( >3σ) preference
is found for the log parabolic fit, and therefore a power-law is
chosen. The number of spectral bins for the SEDs is chosen ac-
cording to the time intervals and flux levels to assure at least four
SED points for each of the three states described in Section 3.3.
The obtained parameters are summarized in Table 1.
2.3. NuSTAR
This work includes four multi-hour exposures from NuSTAR
(Harrison et al. 2013). The NuSTAR instrument consists of
two co-aligned X-ray telescopes focusing on two indepen-
dent focal plane modules, FPMA & FPMB, and provides un-
precedented sensitivity in the 3–79 keV band. In this work,
we analyze all NuSTAR observations from 2022, which all
took place in 2022-03: 09, 22, 24, 27 (MJD 59647, MJD
59660, MJD 59662, MJD 59665; observation ID 60701032002,
60502009002, 60502009004 & 60702062004, respectively).
The raw data are processed using the NuSTAR Data Analy-
sis Software (NuSTARDAS) package v.2.1.1 and CALDB ver-
sion 20220912. The events are screened in the nupipeline pro-
cess with the flags tentacle=yes &saamode=optimized to
remove potential background increase caused by the South At-
lantic Anomaly passages. The source counts are obtained from a
circular region centered around Mrk 501 with a radius of ≈140′′.
The background events are extracted from a source-free nearby
circular region having the same radius. The spectra are then
grouped with the grppha task to obtain at least 20 counts in
each energy bin.
For all exposures, the source spectra dominate over the back-
ground up to roughly ≈30 keV . Hence, we decide to quote fluxes
only up to 30 keV , and in two separate energy bands: 3–7 keV
and 7–30 keV . The best-fit spectral parameters are obtained in
the full NuSTAR band-pass, 3–79 keV , and averaged over the re-
spective observations. We fit the spectra using XSPEC (Arnaud
1996) assuming a log-parabolic function with a normalization
energy fixed to 1 keV . A log-parabola model is significantly pre-
ferred over a simple power-law. Here, and for the rest of the X-
ray analysis performed in this work, a photoelectric absorption
component is added to the model assuming an equivalent hy-
drogen column density fixed to NH=1.7×1020cm−2(HI4PI
Collaboration et al. 2016). The fluxes and spectral parameters
are computed by fitting simultaneously FPMA & FPMB. The
cross-calibration factor between the two focal module planes is
for all bins below 5%, thus well within the expected systematics
(Madsen et al. 2015).
For all NuSTAR pointings, the variability is small and the
fluxes vary at most by ≈10% within each observation. Thus,
the fluxes and spectral parameters are averaged over the entire
exposure time from each observation.
2.4. IXPE
TheIXPE telescope (Weisskopf 2022) was launched in Decem-
ber 2021 and measures polarization in the 2–8 keV regime. In
this work, we use the first three pointing conducted on Mrk 501.
The first two took place from 2022-03-08 to 2022-03-10 (MJD
59646 to MJD 59648) and from 2022-03-27 to 2022-03-29
(MJD 59665 to MJD 59667) and the results are published in
Liodakis et al. (2022), from which we extracted the flux and po-

larization values from Table 1 and 2. A third pointing took place
from 2022-07-09 to 2022-07-12 (MJD 59769 to MJD 59772)
with the results published in Lisalda (2023). We extracted the
polarization values from Table 2 of this paper and integrated the
spectral log parabola model stated to obtain the corresponding
flux values. During all pointings, no variability is observed in
the polarization degree or angle, and the polarization and flux
values are obtained averaged over the full exposures. For more
details on the observations, data reduction, etc, see Liodakis et al.
(2022) and Lisalda (2023).
2.5. Swift-XRT
Simultaneous to the MAGIC observations, several pointing of
the XRT (X-ray Telescope; Burrows et al. 2005) on board
ofSwift (Neil Gehrels Swift Gamma-ray Burst Observatory ;
Gehrels et al. 2004) were organized. Data were taken both in
the Windowed Timing (WT) and Photon Counting (PC) read-
out mode and processed with the XRTDAS software package
(v3.7.0), that was developed by the ASI Space Science Data Cen-
ter3(SSDC), and released in the HEASoft package (v.6.30.1)
by NASA High Energy Astrophysics Archive Research Center
(HEASARC). For calibrating and cleaning the events, calibra-
tion files from Swift -XRT CALDB (version 20210915) are pro-
cessed within the xrtpipeline .
For each observation, we extract the X-ray spectrum from the
summed cleaned event file. In WT readout mode, the spectral
analysis is performed after selecting events from a circle cen-
tered at the source position with a radius of 20 pixels ( ∼46′′;
∼90% of the PSF). In the case of data taken in the PC mode,
they are a ffected by pile-up in the inner part of the PSF. There-
fore events from the most inner region around the source po-
sition within a radius of 4-6 pixels are excluded and an outer
radius of 30 pixels is adopted to select signal events. We then
use the shape of the Swift -XRT PSF to calculate the incident
X-ray flux4. To estimate the background, we use nearby circu-
lar regions with radii of 20 and 40 pixels for WT and PC data.
The task xrtmkarf is used to produce ancillary response files
(ARFs) including corrections for PSF losses and CCD defects
using the cumulative exposure map. The X-ray spectra in the
0.3–10 keV range are binned with grppha ensuring a minimum
of 20 counts per bin. Afterwards, we model them in XSPEC using
power-law and log-parabola models. Energy fluxes are computed
in the 0.3–2 keV and 2–10 keV bands.
2.6. Swift-UVOT
Simultaneous to the XRT pointings, the Ultraviolet /Optical Tele-
scope (UVOT; Roming et al. 2005) also observed in the opti-
cal/UV wavebands. In this work, we considered images acquired
with the three UV filters, W1 (2600 Å), M2 (2246 Å) and W2
(1928 Å), which are less a ffected by the host galaxy emission
than the optical ones. The standard UVOT software within the
HEAsoft package (v.6.23) is used to perform aperture photome-
try for all filters and the calibration is performed using CALDB
(20201026). We review images to avoid unstable attitudes, then
following Poole et al. (2008), we use a circular aperture of 5′′to
extract source counts and an annular aperture with 26′′(34′′)
for the inner (outer) radii to estimate background counts. Using

count rates are converted to fluxes and then dereddened consid-

Finkbeiner 2011) for the UVOT filters e ffective wavelengths and
the mean galactic interstellar extinction curve from Fitzpatrick
(1999).
2.7. Optical
Optical data including flux and polarization measurements were
obtained from the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), the
2.2m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory as part of the
Monitoring AGN with Polarimetry at the Calar Alto Telescopes
(MAPCAT)5, the 1.5m (T150) and the 0.9 m (T090) telescopes
at the Sierra Nevada Observatory, the 1.3m RoboPol telescope
(Skinakas observatory, Greece; King et al. 2014; Ramaprakash
et al. 2019), the 1.5m KANATA (Higashi-Hiroshima obser-
vatory, Japan) telescopes and network of robotic telescopes
BOOTES (Burst Observer and Optical Transient Exploring Sys-
tem; Castro-Tirado et al. 1999). Except for BOOTES, which uses
SDSS filters, Johnson-Cousins filters are used. To convert mag-
nitudes between the di fferent filters Lupton et al. (2005) is used.
Additionally, Tuorla blazar monitoring data of Mrk 501 for
the period between 2022-03-01 and 2022-07-19 (MJD 59639
to MJD 59779) were obtained using the 80 cm Joan Oró Tele-
scope (TJO) at Montsec Observatory, Spain. The observations
were made in the Cousins R-filter. The flux density values are
obtained following standard photometry analysis (Nilsson et al.
2018) using a signal extraction aperture of 7.5". Additionally, to
correct for the flux density contamination coming from the host
galaxy and nearby sources a 12.3 mJy subtraction was imple-
mented following Nilsson et al. (2007).
Flux and polarization degree values were corrected for the
host galaxy contribution following Nilsson et al. (2007), Weaver
et al. (2020) or Hovatta et al. (2016) taking into account the aper-
tures of the telescopes and the seeing conditions. Additionally,
the galaxy extinction correction of 0.041 mag was implemented
following Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) for the flux values.
To also cover the second IXPE pointing, we added the data
taken by the 70 cm AZT-8 telescope of the Crimean Astrophysi-
cal Observatory6, which took both photometric and polarimetric
data with the Cousins R-filter from 2022-03-25 to 2022-03-28
(MJD 59663 to MJD 59666) published in Liodakis et al. (2022)
and applied the same host galaxy and the Galactic extinction cor-
rection to the optical flux. For the polarization degree, values that
had already been corrected are used.
2.8. Radio
In the radio band, observations were taken on Mrk 501 by the
single-dish telescopes at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory
(OVRO) operating at 15 GHz, the Metsähovi Radio Observa-
tory at 37 GHz, the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique
(IRAM) at 86 GHz and 230 GHz and the Submillimeter Array
(SMA) at 226 GHz.
The data from OVRO were taken with the 40 m telescope
blazar monitoring program using a central frequency of 15 GHz
and 3 GHz bandwidth as detailed in Richards et al. (2011).

6In 1991, Ukraine with the Crimean peninsula became an independent
state. While the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory became Ukrainian,
the AZT-8 telescope located there continued to be operated jointly by
the Crimean Observatory and by the St. Petersburg group.

37 GHz data were taken by the Metsähovi Observatory and an-
alyzed according to Teraesranta et al. (1998) using NGC 7027,
3C 274 and 3C 84 as secondary calibrators. Estimates on the er-
ror of the flux density contain the contribution from the mea-
surement root mean square and the uncertainty of the absolute
calibration.
Additional flux, but also polarization data, in the radio band
were collected by the IRAM 30 m telescope under the Polarimet-
ric Monitoring of AGN at Millimeter Wavelengths (POLAMI)
program7(Agudo et al. 2018b,a) in the 3.5 mm (86.24 GHz)
and 1.3 mm (230 GHz) wavebands. The XPOL procedure (Thum
et al. 2008) was used to simultaneously measure the four Stokes
parameters (I, Q, U and V) at the two observing bands. The PO-
LAMI pipeline described in Agudo et al. (2018a) was adopted to
reduce and calibrate the data.
The Submillimeter Array (SMA; Ho et al. 2004) was used to
obtain polarimetric millimeter radio measurements at ∼1.3 mm
(∼226 GHz) within the framework of the SMAPOL (SMA
Monitoring of AGNs with POLarization) program. SMAPOL
follows the polarization evolution of forty γ-ray loud blazars,
including Mrk 501, on a bi-weekly cadence as well as other
sources in a target-of-opportunity (ToO) mode. The Mrk 501 ob-
servations reported here were conducted in June and July, 2022.
The SMA observations use two orthogonally polarized receivers,
tuned to the same frequency range in the full polarization mode,
and use the SWARM correlator (Primiani et al. 2016). These
receivers are inherently linearly polarized but are converted to
circular using the quarter-wave plates of the SMA polarimeter
(Marrone & Rao 2008). The lower sideband (LSB) and upper
sideband (USB) covered 209-221 and 229–241 GHz, respec-
tively. Each sideband was divided into six chunks, with a band-
width of 2 GHz, and a fixed channel width of 140 kHz. The
SMA data were calibrated with the MIR software package8. In-
strumental polarization leakage was calibrated independently for
USB and LSB using the MIRIAD task gpcal (Sault et al. 1995)
and removed from the data. The polarized intensity, position an-
gle, and polarization percentage were derived from the Stokes I,
Q, and U visibilities. MWC 349 A, Callisto and Titan were used
for the total flux calibration and the calibrator 3C 286, which has
high linear polarization degree and stable polarization angle, was
observed as a cross-check of the polarization calibration.
3. Detailed VHE & X-ray analysis during IXPE
observations
The MWL light curves from 2022-03-01 to 2022-07-19 (MJD
59639 to MJD 59779) are shown in Figure 1. The three IXPE
observations conducted during this time range are highlighted
with a grey band. Two observations took place from 2022-03-08
to 2022-03-10 (MJD 59646 to MJD 59648) and from 2022-03-
27 to 2022-03-29 (MJD 59665 to MJD 59667). The third one
took place from 2022-07-09 to 2022-07-12 (MJD 59769 to MJD
59772). In the following, those three periods will be referred to
asIXPE -1,IXPE -2 and IXPE -3, respectively. This section dis-
cusses the MWL states during these observations with a focus
on the VHE and X-ray regimes.
3.1. IXPE observations in March 2022
The first two IXPE observations from 2022-03-08 to 2022-03-
10 and 2022-03-27 to 2022-03-29 (MJD 59646 to MJD 59648
7https://polami.iaa.es/
8https: //lweb.cfa.harvard.edu /cqi/mircook.htmland MJD 59665 to MJD 59667), IXPE -1 and IXPE -2, were re-
ported in Liodakis et al. (2022). The measured polarization de-
gree in the 2–8 keV band for those observations are 10% ±2%
and 11%±2%, respectively, which is around 2 times higher than
the one measured at optical wavelengths. The corresponding po-
larization angles, 134 ±5◦and 115±4◦, match the optical and
radio measurements and are in line with the radio jet direction
of 119.7±11.8◦(Weaver et al. 2022, depicted as a horizontal
grey band in Figure 1). The 2–8 keV flux of the second pointing
(18.0±0.4×10−11erg cm−2s−1) is a factor of two higher than
for the first one (8 .8±0.1×10−11erg cm−2s−1).
Close to the IXPE -1 epoch, four MAGIC observations are
available (see Figure 1). Two observations took place strictly
simultaneous to the IXPE pointing, while the two others hap-
pened one day before and after. The nightly light curve is con-
sistent with a constant flux hypothesis, with a corresponding av-
erage flux of 6 .07±0.29×10−11ph cm−2s−1(∼30% C.U.) above
200 GeV .
Due to bad weather, no MAGIC simultaneous data are avail-
able during IXPE -2. However, one observation took place one
day before the IXPE window and another one two days after
(Figure 1). Between those two MAGIC observations encompass-
ing the IXPE -2 epoch, the MWL fluxes show little variability, in
particular in the X-ray band (see Figure 1), which is typically
well correlated with the VHE emission (Acciari et al. 2020; Fur-
niss et al. 2015; Ahnen et al. 2018; Abe et al. 2023a). We thus
average the two MAGIC exposures to obtain a reasonable ap-
proximation of the VHE state simultaneous to the IXPE -2 expo-
sure. The resulting average flux is 9 .53±0.44×10−11ph cm−2s−1
above 200 GeV (∼50% C.U.), which is ∼40% higher than dur-
ingIXPE -1. Overall, the IXPE -1 and IXPE -2 VHE levels are
within the typical dynamical flux range for Mrk 501 as they re-
main close to the average state (Abdo et al. 2011) and are persis-
tently above its low state flux observed from 2017 to 2019 (Abe
et al. 2023a).
Similar to the VHE band, the Swift -XRT and IXPE mea-
surements also reveal X-ray flux levels that are around a fac-
tor of 2 higher during the IXPE -2 epoch compared to IXPE -
1. On the other hand, while the VHE emission is around the
average source activity, the fluxes in the Swift -XRT bands are
systematically above average. The 2–10 keV fluxes lie between
≈10−10erg cm−2s−1and≈3×10−10erg cm−2s−1, which is sig-
nificantly higher than the levels reported in previous works that
studied the source during an average VHE activity such as a flux
of 7.8±0.2×10−11erg cm−2s−1in 2009 (Abdo et al. 2011) or
a weighted mean of 4 .24±0.01×10−11erg cm−2s−1for 12-year
flux data set from 2008 to 2020 (Abe et al. 2023a). Regarding the
variability, we find that the Swift -XRT data display only slight
flux changes (at the level of ∼10-30%) within each IXPE win-
dow. No intra-night variability is detected, in either the VHE or
the X-ray regimes.
Additionally, four NuSTAR pointings were conducted dur-
ing 2022-03-09, 2022-03-22, 2022-03-24 and 2022-03-27 (MJD
59647, MJD 59660, MJD 59662, MJD 59665). One simultane-
ous to each IXPE -1 and IXPE -2 window, while two other obser-
vations happened shortly before the IXPE -2 pointing. The flux
ranges from 7 .8 to 11.4×10−11erg cm−2s−1in the 3–7 keV
band, which is at least a factor of 5 higher than during the previ-
ous low-activity measurements in 2017-2018 (Abe et al. 2023a),
but similar to the observations reported in 2013 (Furniss et al.
2015) for Mrk 501. The NuSTAR exposures, which are multi-
hour long, o ffer the possibility to search for short timescale vari-
ability. No strong X-ray variability is found on hourly timescale,
and throughout each exposure the flux varies by at most 10%.

plot with a horizontal grey band the average direction angle determined at 43 GHz by Weaver et al. (2022). See text in Section 4 for further details.Article number, page 7 of 19A&A proofs: manuscript no. Mrk501_IXPE_2022_resubmission_20240109
In the radio, optical, Swift -UVOT and Fermi -LAT wave-
bands, the IXPE -1 and IXPE -2 epochs are in a rather averaged
and stable state (Abdo et al. 2011), without significant flux vari-
ations on daily timescales.
3.2. IXPE observation in July 2022
The third IXPE pointing, IXPE -3, took place from 2022-07-09
to 2022-07-12 (MJD 59769 to MJD 59772). It is characterized
by a slightly lower flux level (7 .4±0.4×10−11erg cm−2s−1
in the 2–8 keV band) and polarization degree (7 ±2%) in the X-
rays than for the IXPE -1 & IXPE -2 pointings (Lisalda 2023). For
MAGIC, no strictly simultaneous data are available, but a single
observation took place less than one day before IXPE -3. It shows
a lower flux state compared to the ones in March with a flux of
4.36±1.45×10−11ph cm−2s−1above 200 GeV (∼20% C.U.).
The X-ray fluxes of Swift -XRT are lower than during IXPE -2,
although comparable to the ones measured during IXPE -1.
3.3. Spectral evolution during IXPE campaigns
Table 1 reports the fluxes and spectral parameters during each
IXPE epoch for the MAGIC, Fermi -LAT, NuSTAR andSwift -
XRT observations. For all instruments except NuSTAR , we fit
a simple power-law model given the absence of significant ev-
idence for spectral curvature. The NuSTAR spectra show a sig-
nificant curvature and are thus fitted with a log-parabola model,
dN
dE∝(E/Enorm)−α−βlog(E/Enorm)(with a normalization energy of
Enorm=1 keV). Furthermore, we fix the curvature parameter to
β=0.3 (average value of the pointings) to remove any corre-
lation between αandβ, and obtain a better assessment of the
spectral hardness evolution. For each instrument, we state in the
corresponding panels the time ranges over which the spectra are
computed. For Swift -XRT, the best-fit parameters are shown for
each observation separately given the indication of daily spectral
evolution.
Comparing the three IXPE epochs, one can see the higher
and harder emission for IXPE -2, in particular in the X-ray band.
In fact, IXPE -2 is characterized by one of the hardest X-ray
states from the campaign discussed in this work ( α<1.9). Such
a hard state is not evident in the VHE band, which in fact shows
a constant power-law index between the three epochs within un-
certainties ( α∼2.4−2.5, see Table 1). The Swift -XRT spectra
show a ”harder when brighter” trend that is also observed when
comparing the NuSTAR pointings. In the Fermi -LAT band, the
spectral index softens along the three IXPE time windows lead-
ing to a decrease in energy flux despite increasing photon flux
levels.
We construct MWL SEDs for all pointings. Except for the
γ-ray regime, we used the weighted average of all data points
in the corresponding IXPE time windows as stated in the first
row of Table 1. The only exception is made for the IXPE -2
spectrum, for which the dedicated NuSTAR observation started
shortly before the IXPE time window. Therefore, the NuSTAR
observational window on 2022-03-27 (MJD 59665) is used to
extract the weighted averaged SED points for the radio, UV and
X-ray bands. For the optical regime, the data simultaneous to
IXPE -2 from Liodakis et al. (2022) are used because they are
the only data available around this time window. This ensures
a smooth characterization between the two X-ray instruments
and therefore of the synchrotron peak. For comparison the Swift -
XRT spectrum corresponding to the highest flux level during the
IXPE -2 window is shown with open markers in Figure 2. ForFermi -LAT a time window of two weeks centered on the IXPE
epochs is used to construct the SEDs owing to the low variability
in the band and the lower instrument sensitivity, which requires
longer observation times. For MAGIC, simultaneous data to the
IXPE observations are only available for IXPE -1. We used all
simultaneous nights and also the two surrounding ones to con-
struct the IXPE -1 MAGIC SED because no flux or spectral vari-
ations are seen between the di fferent days. Due to the availability
of VHE observations as discussed in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2
and the absence of strong spectral and flux variability at other
wavebands, the observations surrounding the IXPE windows are
used to construct the IXPE -2 and IXPE -3 VHE SEDs.
The resulting SEDs are shown in Figure 2. For comparison
purposes, we plot in light gray the average source state from
Abdo et al. (2011), and in dark gray the low activity discussed in
Abe et al. (2023a). As anticipated in Section 3.1, Figure 2 high-
lights a drop in the Compton dominance (CD; the ratio between
theνFνvalues at the high-energy and low-energy peaks) with re-
spect to the average activity (light gray points). The entire γ-ray
SED component remains close to the average activity, while the
X-ray emission is significantly higher.
Using the phenomenological model of Ghisellini et al.
(2017), we quantify the peak frequencies and CD for each epoch.
The same phenomenological model is fitted to the average and
low states from Abdo et al. (2011) and Abe et al. (2023a) for
comparison purposes. The results are shown in Table 2. The
obtained best-fit value place both IXPE -1 and IXPE -2 in the
EHSP (Costamante et al. 2001; Biteau et al. 2020) family with
νs>2.4×1017Hz (≈1 keV).
For the third pointing, one can clearly see that the syn-
chrotron peak moved to lower frequency, into the HSP state as
verified by the phenomenological fits (see Table 2) yielding a
νsof∼1×1017Hz. While the MAGIC spectrum shows only
a change in amplitude (without spectral evolution), the Fermi -
LAT spectrum hints towards softer emission, leading to a shift
of the high-energy peak towards lower frequencies by an order
of magnitude.
For all three spectra, the fit of the phenomenological model
confirms a general lower CD (for IXPE -1 and IXPE -2∼0.3, for
IXPE -3 0.2 using the phenomenological model or 0.3 using the
SSC model described in Section 5) than for the average state of
Mrk 501, which is determined to be around ∼0.5.
3.4. Evolution of the polarization degree between the IXPE
epochs
Figure 3 shows the polarization degree of all three IXPE point-
ings in di fferent wavebands, from the radio to the X-ray band.
Additionally, we show in the middle panel the ratio of the po-
larization degree to the one observed in the X-rays. For all three
epochs, the polarization degree increases with frequency show-
ing a ratio that is slightly more than two between the X-ray and
optical regimes. This behavior was first reported for the IXPE -1
andIXPE -2 epochs by Liodakis et al. (2022). IXPE -3 follows
the same trend, but it is interesting to see that while the abso-
lute polarization degree drops with respect to IXPE -1 & IXPE -2
in optical and X-rays, the ratio is roughly conserved and stable
over time (the derived ratios remain consistent within ∼1σ).
As described in Liodakis et al. (2022) and Di Gesu et al.
(2022), the increase of the polarization degree with energy, the
absence of fast variability in the polarization behavior as well as
the alignment of the radio jet with the polarization angle in op-
tical and X-rays strongly suggest that electrons are accelerated
in shocks. The most energetic electrons (those emitting X-ray

Notes. Stated are the MJD of the observations, the flux values in 10−10erg cm−2s−1(for MAGIC with E>200 GeV; for Fermi -LAT from
0.3−300 GeV; for XRT from 2 −10 keV; from 3−7 keV for NuSTAR ), the spectral index αand theχ2/d.o.f. for the spectral fits. For all wavebands,
a simple power law is used as a spectral model (with a normalization energy of 300 GeV for MAGIC, 1 GeV for Fermi -LAT and 1 keV for Swift -
XRT) because there is no significant preference for a log-parabola function, except for the NuSTAR data. The NuSTAR fits are performed using a
log-parabola model with a curvature parameter fixed to 0.3 (and normalization energy at 1 keV).

photons) are confined nearby the shock front, where the mag-
netic field is more ordered, leading to a stronger polarization de-
gree. The electrons subsequently cool, emit lower energy pho-
tons, and advect (or di ffuse) towards larger regions in which
the degree of magnetic field ordering drops significantly. Such
energy-stratified scenario qualitatively explains the broad-band
polarization degree evolution (Tavecchio et al. 2020), and will
be considered for the MWL modeling of the SEDs presented in
Section 5.
The lower panel of Figure 3 shows the average flux states
for the three epochs in each energy bands. No obvious coher-
ent trend is apparent between the evolution of the polarization
degree and the flux level. In fact, while in the optical the polar-
ization degree tends to be anti-correlated with the flux, the X-ray
hints towards an opposite trend.4. Long-term multi-wavelength evolution
This section discusses the MWL evolution throughout the entire
period between 2022-03-01 to 2022-07-19 (MJD 59639 to MJD
59779) in order to provide a broader overview of the source evo-
lution between the several IXPE epochs.
From Figure 1, the VHE flux shows no significant outbursts
and varies around ∼20–50% that of the Crab Nebula, which is
close to the typical state of Mrk 501 (Abdo et al. 2011). The low
(0.2–1 TeV) and high ( >1 TeV) energy ranges follow similar
variability patterns. No ”harder when brighter” trend is found,
which however might be rooted in the lower instrumental sensi-
tivity of MAGIC to unveil slight spectral changes compared to
e.g. X-ray instruments.
TheSwift -XRT bands reveal clear hardening with increasing
flux. In Figure 4, we show the hardness ratio (defined as the ra-
tio of the 2–10 keV flux to the one in the 0.3–2 keV band) as
a function of the 2–10 keV flux. The grey data points are from
individual measurements, while the black points are the hard-
ness ratio binned in flux. The error bars represents the standard
deviation of the hardness ratio in each bin. A positive slope of
0.032±0.002 is found when fitting the individual data points
with a linear function. For the hardness ratio binned in flux, the
best fit slope is comparable, 0 .024±0.003. These slopes are sig-
nificantly lower than what was obtained in Abe et al. (2023a)
during a much lower activity of Mrk 501, possibly indicating a
saturation of the hardness ratio above a certain flux level simi-
larly to what was noted in Mrk 421 in Acciari et al. (2021).
For the UV band, we see a change in flux happening around
April slightly increasing the average UV flux level, which can
be explained by the shift of the synchrotron peak to lower fre-
quencies. The latter explanation is also suggested by comparing
the three IXPE SEDs in Figure 2, which unveil a mild increase

Considering the whole time epoch from 2022-03-01 to 2022-
07-19 (MJD 59639 to MJD 59779), all wavebands show small
variability scales. As shown in Figure 5 and reported in Ta-
ble A.1, Fvaris always below 0.3 for the full time epoch (closed
markers). The high-energy X-rays and VHE γ-rays display the
highest degrees of variability. As reported with data from other
multi-instrument campaigns Metsähovi systematically shows a
higher Fvarthan OVRO (Aleksi ´c et al. 2015a; Furniss et al. 2015;
Ahnen et al. 2018; Madsen et al. 2021), however, we also find a
higher degree of variability of the 230 GHz IRAM data com-
pared with the 86 GHz data. The high variability in the 37 GHzis not caused by a flaring event, but rather by a flickering in the
radio fluxes, which may perhaps be produced by the somewhat
limited sensitivity of Metsähovi, and the relatively low bright-
ness of Mrk 501 at radio. To check that the higher variability
degree in Metsähovi is not caused by a threshold e ffect, we com-
puted it using di fferent signal quality cuts, namely the signal to
noise ratio S /N>5, 7 and 10. We found that, for all the above-
mentioned signal qualities, the computed Fvarvalues are con-
sistent with the one computed with the full data set (S /N>4),
which is higher than the Fvarobtained for low-frequency radio
instruments. Additionally, we investigate the variability for only
theIXPE time windows shown by the turquoise markers in Fig-
ure 5. Due to a lack of simultaneous data, it is not computed
for theγ-ray data. For the X-rays a higher degree of variability
is found than in the full time period, while for the lower wave-
bands, radio to UV , a very similar behavior between the time
epochs is found.
We searched for intra-band correlation and found a hint
of positive correlation only between the VHE and X-ray light
curves, which also correspond to the energy bands with the
strongest variability and the locations of the two SED peaks. The
correlation is quantified using the discrete correlation function
(DCF; Edelson & Krolik 1988), which we compute between the
MAGIC fluxes above 200 GeV and the 0.3–2 keV & 2–10 keV
fluxes from Swift -XRT. The DCF is calculated for a series of
time lags from -20 days to +20 days between the light curves us-
ing time lag steps of 5 days, which is in agreement with the time
scale taken from the auto-correlation behavior of Mrk 501 dur-
ing low activity in Abe et al. (2023a). The significance of the
correlation is estimated based on Monte Carlo simulations in a
similar fashion as the one described in MAGIC Collaboration
et al. (2021). We simulate 104pairs of uncorrelated light curves
that respect the sampling and binning of the real data. The DCF
significance band in each time lag is then obtained from the dis-
tribution of DCF values of the simulations. To simulate the light

tween the X-ray and VHE band (Acciari et al. 2020; Furniss et al.

As for the long-term evolution in the polarization, we note
an increase of the polarization degree on a few day timescale in
the R-band around 2022-05-21 (MJD 59720). The R-band po-
larization increases by a factor ∼2 and reaches a level of 12%,
which is above the degree in the X-ray during the IXPE epochs.

No significant flare is observed simultaneous to this elevated op-
tical polarization state. The lack of simultaneous MWL polariza-
tion data prevents us from making more detailed investigations.
As for the polarization angle, moderate variability by a few tens
of degrees can be seen in the radio and optical bands. A signifi-
cant o ffset between the R-band and radio (SMA; 226 GHz) angle
temporarily occurs from 2022-05-31 (MJD 59730) to 2022-06-
30 (MJD 59760). The angle deviates by ∼60◦around 2022-05-
31 (MJD 59730). This behavior contrasts with the one during
theIXPE epochs where a rough alignment (within ∼30◦) of the
optical /radio/X-ray polarization angle can be noticed.
5. Modeling of the SEDs during the IXPE observing
windows
We exploit the broad-band SEDs shown in Figure 2 to perform a
modeling of the emission assuming a leptonic scenario. We con-
sider an energy-stratified emission region, as suggested by the
optical-to-X-ray polarization properties (see Section 3.4). The
region consists of two overlapping blobs, each of them with dif-
ferent radius R′. The two blobs contribute dominantly to dis-
tinct energy regions of the SED. The X-ray and >100 GeVγ-
ray fluxes are dominated by a “compact zone”, located close to
the shock. The second zone, dubbed as “extended zone”, con-
tributes to the radio, optical /UV and MeV-GeV fluxes. The “ex-
tended zone” is significantly larger than the “compact zone”,
and expands over a larger volume downstream the shock front.
The theoretical framework that we use here is in line with the
energy-stratified model of Liodakis et al. (2022); Angelakis et al.
(2016); Itoh et al. (2016), where the X-ray emission is produced
closer to the shock front than the optical emission. In Figure 8
we show a sketch depicting the jet morphology of our model-
ing framework. While considering two distinct zones is surely a
simplification of the system (one would rather expect a contin-
uum of several regions contributing to the di fferent parts of the
SED), a more realistic description of the system would require
a much more detailed treatment of particle cooling and di ffu-
sion/advection that is beyond the scope of this work. This sim-
plified model already allows one to constrain important prop-
erties of the emission states of Mrk 501 during the three IXPE
pointings.In order to limit the degrees of freedom, we make the fol-
lowing assumptions. Parameters referred to the blob frame are
marked as primed, while unmarked ones relate to the observer
frame.
–The Doppler factor δis fixed to 11 consistent with the one
used in Abe et al. (2023a). For simplicity, the same value is
chosen for both regions.
–In order to estimate the relative size between the two zones,
we proceed as follows: we first assume that the “compact re-
gion” can be modelled by Nturbulent plasma cells of iden-
tical magnetic field strength, but with random orientation. In
such a configuration, the expected average polarization de-
gree from the zone can be approximated as Pdeg≈75%/√
N
(Marscher 2014; Tavecchio 2021). Given that IXPE -1 and
IXPE -2 are characterized by Pdeg, X-ray≈10% in the X-ray
band, it implies N≈60 during the latter two epochs. Regard-
ingIXPE -3,Pdeg, X-ray≈7%, corresponds to N≈110. The
size of the “extended zone” dominating the optical emission
is then assumed to be a factor lgreater than the “compact re-
gion” such that the number of turbulent cells in the “extended
zone” matches the optical polarization degree according to
Pdeg≈75%/√
l N. For IXPE -1 and IXPE -2,Pdeg, opt.≈5%,
yielding l≈5. For IXPE -3,Pdeg, opt.≈2%, which implies
l≈10.
Assuming that turbulent cells roughly span equal volumes,
we obtain that the radius of the “extended zone” should
be a factor l1/3larger than the one of the “compact zone”.
For all epochs, we set the radius of the “compact zone” to
R′=2.9×1016cm. This is in agreement with a light cross-
ing time R′/(cδ)≈1 day, which is the variability timescale
observed in the X-ray band.
–The electron distribution inside the “compact zone” is mod-
elled with a broken power-law function normalized such that
the electron energy density is given by U′
e. The distribution
is defined between a minimum and maximum Lorentz factor
ofγ′
minandγ′
max. The break is located at γ′
break. The slopes
below and above the break are given by n1andn2, respec-
tively.γ′
minis set to a value such that the “compact zone”
remains sub-dominant in the optical /UV . With the choice of
δandR′mentioned above, we derive γ′
min∼104. Within an
ion-electron plasma, mildly relativistic shocks, in which the
shock front is moving at a Lorentz factor γsh∼1−3 relative
to the unshocked plasma, are expected to generate somewhat
lowerγ′
min, in the order of a few 103(Zech & Lemoine 2021).
Values ofγ′
min∼104may be reached for fully relativistic
shocks with γshof a few tens. In order to constrain γ′
max, we
equate the acceleration and cooling timescales. The acceler-
ation timescale in shock acceleration is estimated with:
t′
acc=20λ(γ′)c
3u2s(4)
whereλ(γ′)=(ξγ′mec2)/(eB′) is the mean free path of elec-
trons, parameterized as a fraction ξof the Larmor radius. ξ
is an acceleration parameter, which we fix to 104. The latter
value is in agreement with previous estimates from Zhang
(2002) based on spectral hysteresis observations of a similar
HSP, Mrk 421. B′is the magnetic field strength and ethe

–The electron distribution inside the “extended zone” is mod-
elled with a simple power-law function because the available
data prevent a precise determination of breaks or other distri-
butions with more degrees of freedom. The slope of the dis-
tribution is assumed to be p=2.2. The minimum and maxi-
mum Lorentz factor of the distribution, γ′
min&γ′
maxare con-
strained by the radio-to-UV data. The distribution is normal-
ized to an energy density of U′
e. We keepγ′
maxwithin a factor
2 from the expected cooling break that is given by equat-
ing the cooling timescale due to synchrotron and inverse-
Compton processes with the escape timescale R′/c.
We start by first fitting the X-ray and γ-ray data to determine
the remaining free parameters of the “compact zone” (i.e., mag-
netic field B′,U′
e,n1,n2). In a second step, the “extended zone”
is added in order to get a good description of the radio-to-UV
andFermi -LAT data. Between the IXPE-1 andIXPE -2 epochs,
the data are satisfactorily described with the same parameters
for the “extended zone”, which is not surprising given the lower
variability in the radio, optical /UV and Fermi -LAT data (see Fig-
ure 1 and Figure 5), and the relatively short time period between
IXPE -1 and IXPE -2 of a few weeks, while IXPE -3 took place
several month later.
The adopted model is shown in Figure 9 for each epoch. The
dashed blue lines and dashed-dotted violet lines are the contri-
butions from the “compact zone” and “extended zone”, respec-
tively. The solid light blue line is the sum of the two regions. We
also compute the interaction between the two zones (dotted pink
line), which results from electron inverse-Compton scattering o ff
the photon field that the two regions feed to each others. The de-
rived parameter values are shown in Table 3. Overall, the model
describes well all three broad-band SEDs. A more detailed inter-
pretation of the results is given in Section 6.

59646 to 59648 and MJD 59665 to 59667) and IXPE -3 from
2022-07-09 to 2022-07-12 (MJD 59769 to 59772).
Both the VHE and X-ray regimes showed the highest flux
level during IXPE -2 (∼factor of 2 higher than during the other
IXPE windows). Comparing the spectral properties, a spec-
tral hardening with increasing flux levels is observed in the
X-rays between the di fferent pointings, which is supported by
the “harder when brighter” trend observed over the full cam-
paign (see Figure 4). The opposite behavior can be seen in the
high-energy γ-ray data where the spectral index is softening with
higher flux levels. No spectral change in the VHE is seen be-
tween the three pointings. Interestingly, the power-law indices
in the X-rays are rather hard during IXPE -1 and IXPE -2 (≲2),
as is typically observed for elevated flux states, while the VHE
spectral hardness remains close to the average Mrk 501 activity
(power-law index ∼2.5; Abdo et al. 2011).
Noteworthy is not just the change in spectral index, but also
the broad-band characteristics of the di fferent SEDs (see Ta-
ble 2), which revealed an EHSP behavior of Mrk 501 in the
IXPE -1 and IXPE -2 states with a synchrotron peak frequency
well beyond 1 keV . During IXPE -3 the blazar has gone back to
its more typical HSP behavior shifting the synchrotron peak by
an order of magnitude towards lower energies. The shift in syn-
chrotron peak frequencies can explain the positive change in flux
observed in the UV band of the MWL LC around April (see Fig-
ure 1). The accompanying shift of the high-energy peak can ex-
plain the di fferent flux behavior of the high-energy γ-rays, which
increases steadily between the three states compared with the
rise and then fall of the fluxes in the VHE and X-rays. During all
three states, we find a low Compton dominance compared to the
typical state of Mrk 501 (Abdo et al. 2011) by a factor of 2 (see
Table 2). Additionally, we show the same parameters obtained
from the leptonic modeling in Table 4 for comparison. While the
parameters for IXPE -1 and IXPE -2 match very well, both peak
frequencies shift towards lower energies for IXPE -3. However,
when considering the increased uncertainties of the parameters
for the IXPE -3 state, a clear shift can only be claimed for the
synchrotron peak. This shows the poorer coverage of this emis-
sion state in our data, and highlights that especially the perceived
drop in CD for IXPE -3 as observed in Table 2 should be consid-
ered with caution due to the dependence on the peak frequency.
Mrk 501 has previously shown EHSP behavior during large
flaring activity in 1997 (Tavecchio et al. 2001) and 2013 (Fur-
niss et al. 2015). This EHSP behavior during large flaring ac-Table 4: Peak frequencies, νsandνIC, and Compton dominance

tivity has also been seen in other HSP blazars (MAGIC Col-
laboration et al. 2020b,a). Additionally, similarly to the HSP
1ES 2344 +514 (Abe et al. 2023b), Mrk 501 has shown EHSP
behavior during non-flaring activity, as reported in Ahnen et al.
(2018), that used the extensive multi-instrument campaign in
2012. Compared to the data from 2022 that is reported in this
manuscript, the above-mentioned studies from past campaigns
showed a far higher variability in both VHE and X-rays. While
similar average flux levels are found in the X-rays in 2012 com-
pared to this work, the average VHE flux levels were close to
the typical flux levels of Mrk 501 during the EHSP behavior.
However, both bands depict larger flux changes in 2012 than in
the 2022 campaign, together with higher degrees of variability,
reaching up to Fvar∼1 in the VHE. The main di fference in be-
havior during 2022 compared to that reported in 2012 /2013 is
that only the X-rays show a hard spectrum while in 2012 /2013
both X-rays and VHE revealed atypically hard SEDs.
In addition to shift in peak frequencies, the polarization de-
gree drops for the IXPE -3 pointing, both in the X-rays and op-
tical regime. However, the ratio between the optical and X-ray
band polarization stays rather constant during all three point-
ings (see Figure 3). In fact, the X-ray polarization is system-
atically a factor∼2−3 higher than in the optical band for
each IXPE epoch. No obvious trend between the changes in flux
in the corresponding regimes and the change in polarization is
seen. Therefore, the spectral changes and broad-band SEDs are
more probable to explain the di fferences in polarization degree
between the di fferent states as will be discussed further below
using our theoretical modeling.
The polarization angle during the IXPE epochs shows a
rough alignment between the radio, optical and X-ray bands
(within∼30◦). The values are close to the average jet angle
of 119±12◦determined by Weaver et al. (2022) using Very
Long Baseline Array imaging at 43 GHz (see Figure 1, bottom
Article number, page 14 of 19S. Abe et al.: Radio to TeV observations of Mrk 5011 during the IXPE campaigns
panel). Nonetheless, in the middle of the campaign, both the ra-
dio (SMA; 226 GHz) and optical (R-band) polarization angles
depict some variability and deviate from the jet angle in an in-
coherent manner. Indeed, around 2022-05-31 (MJD 59730), the
offset between the radio and optical bands reaches ∼60◦. This
behaviour strongly points towards a separation (at least partially)
between the optical and radio regions. The deviation of the po-
larization angle from the jet axis may arise if the emitting regions
are located in a portion of the jet where bending on short scale
occurs (Lyutikov et al. 2005; Myserlis et al. 2018; Tavecchio
2021). Furthermore, it points towards multiple emission regions
being responsible for the long-term behavior of Mrk 501 with a
stable part of the magnetic field regulated by shocks, but at times
dominated by more variable /turbulent contributions as also pro-
posed in Abe et al. (2023a).
Over the full time period, the blazar showed a rather stable
behavior with typical (Abdo et al. 2011) flux levels in the VHE
(∼20-50% C.U.). In contrast, the XRT flux values are constantly
above 10−10erg cm−2s−1. Based on the long-term light curve
presented in Abe et al. (2023a), this indicates an elevated state
with respect to the average X-ray activity (Abdo et al. 2011). It
confirms that the atypically low Compton dominance during the
IXPE windows is a feature present throughout the entire cam-
paign presented in this work. For all bands, the fractional vari-
ability stays below Fvar=0.3 when considering the full time
epoch with slightly higher ones in the X-rays for only the IXPE
time windows (see Figure 5). Even though di fferent behaviors
are reported in the X-rays and VHE, we identify evidence for a
correlation between the two bands without a time lag (see Fig-
ures 6 and 7). The correlations are found with significances be-
tween 2σto 3σ, limited by the short time epoch considered, the
low flux levels, the very low variability, and the somewhat lim-
ited sensitivity in the VHE γ-ray band in comparison with the
higher sensitivity to measure flux changes in the X-ray band.
To further investigate the emission states behind the first
IXPE pointings, we modelled the broad-band SEDs with a two-
zone leptonic model (see Section 5). We assume a “compact”
region, which is nearby the shock front and populated by freshly
accelerated electrons, responsible for the X-ray and VHE γ-ray
band. The “compact region” is embedded into an “extended
region” which expands downstream the shock. The “extended
region” dominates the emission in the radio, optical, UV and
Fermi -LAT bands. Such a morphology of the emitting region is
motivated by the energy dependency of the polarization degree
between the radio and the X-rays (Liodakis et al. 2022), which
points towards an energy stratified jet. In addition, previous long-
term correlation studies (e.g. Abe et al. 2023a) points towards
the same emitting region dominating the X-ray and γ-ray bands.
While the “extended” zone is assumed to be constant between
the three pointing, the “compact” one varies over time to de-
scribe the observed spectral changes.
A good description of the observations from radio to VHE
is achieved for each epoch. The X-ray data during IXPE -1 and
IXPE -2 constrain well both the rising and falling edges of the
synchrotron SED close to the peak energy. This provides in turn
strong constraints on the spectral shape of the electron distribu-
tion within the region nearby the shock front. Below the break,
which either results from cooling or acceleration e ffects, the de-
rived index of the electron distribution is n1=2.25 for the “com-
pact zone”. This is well in agreement with expectation from
diffusive acceleration in relativistic shocks (Kirk et al. 2000).
Regarding the IXPE -3 epoch, similar n1are obtained although
in those cases n1is less constrained given the shift of the syn-
chrotron peak towards lower energies.The emission resulting from the interaction between two
zones brings a significant contribution to the Fermi -LAT band.
Consequently, the X-rays should not only correlate with the
VHE fluxes (as reported several times in the past for Mrk 501),
but also with the one from Fermi -LAT. Using 12 years of data,
Abe et al. (2023a) detected a positive correlation between the
Swift -XRT and Fermi -LAT emission, which is thus in good
agreement with our model.
Between the di fferent epochs, most of the parameters of the
“compact zone” are quite similar. A main di fference is the drop
ofγ′
brby a factor≈4 during IXPE -3 with respect to IXPE -1
andIXPE -2 in order to explain the shift towards lower energies
of the synchrotron component. The obtained γ′
breakforIXPE -1
andIXPE -2 are a factor of 4 higher than the one expected for a
self-consistent equilibrium between cooling due to synchrotron
and inverse-Compton processes, injection and escape (Tavecchio
et al. 1998). For IXPE -3 the di fference relaxes to a factor of 2.
Additionally, the magnetic field B′increases by≈40% during
IXPE -3, from 0.050 G to 0.068 G.
The drop in the optical /X-ray polarization degree during the
IXPE -3 epoch compared to the earlier IXPE epochs suggests a
general evolution of the shock properties. The increase of B′in
the “compact zone” for IXPE -3 points towards an evolution of
the magnetization. Within a multi-cell scenario, the shift in peak
frequencies can be attributed to an increase of synchrotron cool-
ing due to stronger magnetic field strength. At the same time,
the drop in polarization implies that the magnetic field becomes
less ordered and that the emitting region is composed by a larger
number of turbulent plasma cells. It has been shown before that
turbulences created by relativistic shock propagation could lead
to an amplification in the magnetic field (Mizuno et al. 2014).
Furthermore, as discussed in Kirk et al. (2000) and Komissarov
& Lyutikov (2011), a higher magnetization can lead to a decrease
of the shock compression ratio κ(defined as the ratio between
the upstream and downstream plasma velocity in the shock ref-
erence frame). Since the polarization degree is positively corre-
lated withκ, it can be expected that an increase of the magne-
tization caused by a more turbulent plasma results in an overall
decrease of the polarization degree. Such a scenario may thus
explain why IXPE-3 is characterized by a larger number of tur-
bulent cells compared to IXPE-1 andIXPE-2 as pointed out in
Sect. 5, where we derive ∼60 cells for IXPE-1 andIXPE-2 and
∼110 cells for IXPE-3 in the “compact zone”.
For simplicity, the radius of the “compact zone” is the same
for all epochs in our model and is set to the highest value al-
lowed by the daily timescale variability observed in the X-rays.
However, one may argue that a higher number of turbulent cells
during IXPE-3 actually suggests a larger emitting zone with re-
spect to the other epochs. If one assume a stable magnetic field
of 5×10−2G in the “compact zone” throughout the observing
campaign (which is the value derived for IXPE -1 and IXPE -2),
we find that the radius of the “compact zone” should increase
by∼20% with respect to IXPE-1 andIXPE-2 to properly de-
scribe the SED of IXPE -3. Such a relative radius increase leads
to 1.7 times more turbulent cells in the emitting region, under
the assumption that turbulent cells have a roughly constant vol-
ume over time. This is in good agreement with the fact that
theIXPE-3 “compact zone” should be composed by ∼twice the
number of turbulent cells compared to IXPE-1 andIXPE-2 (see
Sect. 5). In summary, based on our modeling, the decrease of the
polarization degree throughout the IXPE epochs may be qualita-
tively explained by a change of magnetization and /or a change
of the emitting region size.

In conclusion, with this 2022 data set we could, for the first
time, combine broad-band MWL data up to the VHE together
with polarization measurements up to the X-rays, which allowed
us to better constrain the emission and acceleration behind the
observed radiation. This shows the crucial role of further MWL
monitoring in combination with coverage of the X-ray polariza-
tion of di fferent emission states of Mrk 501 to extend our knowl-
edge on the mechanisms behind the blazar’s emission. Further
insights could be gained by polarization measurements at even
higher energies covering the high-energy peak of the SED. In
this context, e-ASTROGAM (De Angelis et al. 2017), COSI
(Tomsick et al. 2021) or AMEGO (McEnery et al. 2019), which
are being constructed or considered for construction in the next
years, could add even more vital insights.
