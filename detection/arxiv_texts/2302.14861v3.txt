Abstract: We find that unitarity cuts and the duality between color and kinematics are
sufficient constraints to bootstrap D-dimensional QCD scattering amplitudes starting from
three-particle tree-level. Specifically, we calculate tree level amplitudes through six-points, as
well as the four-point one-loop correction for massive fermions in the fundamental represen-
tation of the gauge group – constructing a color-dual representation of the latter for the first
time. To do so we clarify a prescription for functional kinematic ansatze involving fermionic
matter. The advantages of color-dual calculation, familiar from particles in the adjoint, also
apply here: only a small number of basis topologies must be constrained via physical infor-
mation of the theory, and algebraic relations propagate this to a full solution. As all the QCD
amplitudes we construct here are color-dual, they trivially generate D-dimensional amplitudes
in gravitational theories via double-copy construction.arXiv:2302.14861v3  [hep-th]  24 Sep 2024Contents

1 Introduction
Traditionally, scattering amplitudes for relativistic quantum field theories are calculated by
deriving Feynman rules from a given Lagrangian. There are, however, inconveniences with
this approach. First, Feynman rules propagate a tremendous redundancy of off-shell informa-
tion, especially for external gluons and gravitons, that must cancel in physical observables.
This means that individual diagrams, themselves unphysical, tend to be large and unwieldy,
even if the final amplitude can be written in a very compact form. A second issue is that
the number of individual diagrams grows factorially as multiplicity and loop level increases.
Unitarity methods deal with the first problem by restricting to on-shell physical expressions
when writing down amplitudes. The duality between color and kinematics begins to alleviate
the second because we only need to feed physical information to a smaller set of basis dia-
grams, with algebraic relations propagating the information to the entire amplitude. We take
advantage of both of these complementary ideas to bootstrap QCD amplitudes with massive
fermions.
Unitarity demands that amplitudes factorize appropriately to sums over products of
lower multiplicity amplitudes when virtual (internal) particles become physical – i.e. when
the momenta of internal particles are taken on-shell [1] – described as cut. These sums are
over all physical states that could cross such cuts. This imposes strict constraints on loop
integrands – i.e. fusing [2, 3] tree-level data into multiloop integrands. In color-ordered
unitarity cuts of loop amplitudes, only an exponential subset of graphs contribute rather
than the factorial number contributing to the full amplitude.
The duality between color and kinematics is manifest in gauge theories when one can
satisfy the same identities between kinematics factors as for colors. This duality was first
proposed by Bern, Johansson and one of the current authors (BCJ) , and is intimately related
to the double-copy construction, whereby one can construct gravity amplitudes from gauge
theory expressions [4, 5]. In the last decade, these ideas have been applied to a web of theories
both at tree and loop-integrand level. For recent reviews, see refs. [6–8].
At tree-level, QCD amplitudes with massive quarks in the fundamental are known to re-
spect the duality between color and kinematics [9–11]. At loop level, super-QCD amplitudes
with massless matter have been shown to be color-dual through two-loops with external glu-
ons [12–16]. In this paper we consider massive fermionic matter through four-point one-loop.
We do not use Feynman rules, except to verify our results, but instead take advantage of
both on-shell D-dimensional methods and the color-kinematics duality to construct scatter-
ing amplitudes for QCD with fundamental fermions at both tree and one-loop level. This
necessitates clarifying appropriate rules for describing kinematic weights of fermionic mat-
ter functionally. This is intimately related to the work of ref. [17] where it was found that
– 2 –scalar QCD amplitudes respect color-kinematics duality at tree and one-loop level and can
be similarly bootstrapped via simply imposing mass-dimension, color-kinematics duality, and
factorization.
One of our key results is the construction of BCJ-dual numerators which can be used in
the double-copy procedure to straightforwardly generate gravitational amplitudes involving
massive matter [18–20]. For example, the integrands we generate can be double-copied with
that of [17] to generate the one-loop correction to massive fermion scattering mediated
by axion-dilaton gravity, or with itself to generate the one-loop correction to two-to-two
scattering of massive vectors mediated by axion-dilaton gravity. Results in Einstein-Hilbert
gravitation can be straightforwardly constructed via projective double-copy [21]. We note that
this is complementary to recent work in the effective worldline formalism that has seen the
consideration of color-dual massive spinning particles with an eye towards double-copy and
relevance to gravitational wave astrophysics in the classical limit [22–30], including massive
color-dual fermionic amplitudes [31].
We briefly review the duality between color and kinematics and unitarity methods in
Section 2. A famous quote in the amplitudes community1: frequently ascribed to Lev Landau
goes as follows,
A method is more important than a discovery, since the right method will lead to
new and even more important discoveries.
The method we develop here is establishing color-dual functional ansatze for external D-
dimensional massive fermions which we apply largely here to Dirac fermions in the funda-
mental. We present our rules for functional ansatze involving fermionic matter in Section 3.
The following three sections clarify the use of this approrach in developing specific color-dual
results presented as D-dimensional color-dual numerators. In Section 4, we walk through
examples of bootstrapping tree-level QCD amplitudes in the massless limit, and we see that
unitarity cuts and color-kinematics duality are sufficient to fix any ansatze for numerators.
We emphasize that the construction is D-dimensional for Dirac fermions in the fundamen-
tal. If the duality between color-and-kinematics were to place dimensional constraints then
the duality would only be satisfied in particular dimensions. We present an example what
of such a constraint would look like by considering same-flavor fermions in the adjoint at
four-points in Section 4.3 and see that the adjoint color-dual relations are only satisfied under
four-dimensional fiertz identities – consistent with dimensional constraints due to supersym-
metry.
We generalize to massive matter at tree-level in Section 5. We use these results to
construct various four-point one-loop amplitudes in QCD in Section 6, where we verify boot-
strapped gauge theory results against the known results. Specfically we present the basis
numerators for four-external fermions at 1-loop in Eqn. 6.13, Eqn. 6.14, and Eqn. 6.15, as
well as the color-dual basis for external glue with Nffermions running around the loop.

– 3 –The latter expressions, depending as they do upon formal polarizations, are too lengthy to
conveniently typeset, so we relegate them to ancilary machine-readable files. Instead in Sec-
tion 6.2 we describe in detail both the steps involved in performing the calculation, and its
verification involving Passarino-Veltman (PV) [32] reduction to the known basis of one-loop
integrals. Furthermore we specialize to external four-dimensions to recover the simple rational
result for all-plus helicity gluons which is compact enough to present in Eqn. 6.27. Recovering
this known result is a critical verification that we correctly handled internal D-dimensional
cut-construction as four-dimensional cut-construction will famously miss such rational terms.
We summarize and outline intriguing next steps in Section 7.
2 Review
2.1 Color-kinematics duality at tree and loop level
In general, one can write [10, 33, 34] QCD scattering amplitudes at tree level for m-particles
interacting with kdistinct fermion pairs in terms of cubic graphs as:
AQCD-tree
m,k=gm−2ν(k,m)X
ic(i)n(i)
d(i). (2.1)
The sum runs over the ν(k, m) distinct cubic graphs, with c(i),n(i)andd(i)denoting their
color factors, kinematic numerator factors, and denominators respectively. We use gfor the
coupling constant. The number of cubic graphs is given,
ν(k, m) =(2m−5)!!
(2k−1)!!. (2.2)
The maximal number of graphs occurs for the cases where either all external particles are
gluons or there is a single pair of fermions. Additional quark-antiquark pairs mean fewer
distinct graphs. Contact terms are absorbed into such a cubic representation by multiplying
the contact term by appropriate factors of unity represented by propagator over propagator
terms. Generally, color factors will be a product of adjoint and fundamental color structures.
There are two different three-point building blocks to construct QCD color-weights. One
of them consists of dressing vertices with pure gluons, which are dressed in with color-structure
constants fabc, and the other is a quark-antiquark pair with a gluon, which is dressed in the
fundamental, Ta
i¯ȷ, as depicted in Fig. 1. There is a certain freedom in assigning complementary
phases to color-factors and kinematic weights — as long as their product remains unchanged in
physical amplitudes. We say more about the power of exploiting this freedom to accommodate
fermionic signs shortly.

Figure 1 : We depict the diagrammatic building blocks of the cubic graphs associated with
QCD amplitudes. The pure gluonic vertex (left) is dressed in the adjoint representation, while
quark-antiquark pair with a gluon (right) is dressed with a generator in the fundamental.
Contact terms associated with higher vertices are encoded in cubic graphs by appropriate
factors unity in the form of propagators divided by propagators.
Color-factors of graphs obey similar Jacobi and commutation identities which can be
understood as three-term identities between graphs:

Ta
i¯ȷTb
j¯k−Tb
i¯ȷTa
j¯k=fabcTc
i¯k(mixed adjoint-fundamental) (2.3)
with sums over repeated indices. We refer to both relations as Jacobi-like.
Once color-weights for an amplitude are expressed in a minimal basis via antisymme-
try and Jacobi-like relations, any coefficient of the remaining color-weights must be gauge-
invariant, as it can not cancel against any other contribution to the amplitude. Such coef-
ficients are called color-ordered or color-stripped amplitudes and generically consist of sums
over graphs contributing to that color-order. In the most severe case, such as all-gluon or
one fermion pair, an exponential number of graphs can contribute to a color-ordered ampli-
tude. This stands in contrast to the factorial number of graphs that can contribute to the
full color-dressed amplitude.
In recent years there has been a renewed interest in finding independent color basis for
all multiplicity fundamental representations at tree and loop level [10, 33–36]. Here, on a case
by case basis, we will find a relevant minimal basis by simply reducing the linear equations
relating redundant color factors as they arise. For example, in scattering of one distinct
fermion pair with two gluons, three cubic graphs contribute, as depicted in Fig. 2.

Using the Jacobi identity,
c(2¯f,1f,3A,4A) =c(1f,3A,4A,2¯f)−c(1f,4A,3A,2¯f), (2.6)
we can rewrite the amplitude in terms of a minimal color basis. This yields the full amplitude
written as,
−iA=c(1f,3A,4A,2¯f)n(1f,3A,4A,2¯f)

The coefficient of each independent color factor must be gauge-invariant and correspond to
ordered amplitudes:

The duality between color and kinematics is satisfied if we can find a representation of
kinematic weights which satisfy the same Jacobi-like relations as the color weights,
ni+nj+nk= 0 for graphs {i, j, k}such that ci+cj+ck= 0. (2.9)
– 6 –With such color-dual kinematic representations we can replace the color factors in Eqn. 2.1
with concordant kinematics factors to build a gravitational amplitude:
AGR-tree
m,k =iκ
2m−2ν(k,m)X
i˜n(i)n(i)
d(i). (2.10)
This procedure is called the double-copy construction of gravitational amplitudes.
Similarly, there is a double-copy procedure for loop amplitudes at the integrand level [5].
The general form of m-point L-loop scattering amplitudes with kdistinguished quark-antiquark
pairs in D-space-time dimensions in QCD is given,
AQCD
L,m,k=iLgm−2+2LX
iZLY
i=ldDpl
(2π)L1
Sic(i)n(i)
d(i), (2.11)
where the sum is over all cubic m-point L-loop graphs and the integral is over the independent
loop momentum pl. The (multi)-loop case requires Sifor the automorphic symmetric factor of
the diagram under redundant relabelings of either external or loop momenta. When kinematic
weights are found that satisfy the duality between color and kinematics on all cuts, we can
build the gravitational amplitudes at loop level by replacing the color factors in the above
equation by their dual kinematics factors:
AGR
L,m,k =iL+1k

In this paper, we focus on finding the color-dual representation of numerators at tree and
one-loop level when pairs of fermions are present. We find representations that satisfy the
duality between color and kinematics for all off-shell values of internal legs, and therefore
satisfy all physical cuts.
2.2 Unitarity cuts
We include here a lightning review of relevant on-shell methods, but for pedagogic lecture
notes on graph-organized cut verification and construction see e.g. ref [37] as well as a more
specialized review with detailed discussion of unitarity methods in for perturbative QCD [38].
Consider the verification problem for loop-level amplitudes at the integrand level. In
other words, how can one verify that an integrand is correct for an intended theory? It is
necessary that any integrand must integrate to the same expression that one would have
arrived at from Feynman rules for a given theory. A sufficient condition2is that all on-shell
unitarity cuts are satisfied. Unitarity cuts place on-shell the internal lines of sets of graphs
contributing to an integrand. The resulting cut integrand must match the sum over states
across cut legs of the product of corresponding tree-amplitudes, where only physical states
2This condition is not strictly necessary as one can imagine including terms that violate individual cuts but
vanish upon integration – so still yielding the correct amplitude.
– 7 –are allowed to cross the cut. One can invert sufficient verifications to constructively build
integrand representations by constraining a spanning ansatz to satisfy all unitarity cuts. One
can think of this as a way to systematically guarantee that no relevant off-shell information
contained in Feynman rules has been discarded from an integrand, while only evaluating more
compact on-shell quantities. Any free parameters after the constraints of all physical cuts
must vanish for any physical observable. This constructive approach is efficiently organized in
terms of graphs. When organized and applied in terms of operations on graphs, one finds the
same methodology is applied towards considering factorization consistency at tree-level. So
here we do not distinguish between tree-level factorization and unitarity methods, describing
the former in terms of the latter.

Figure 3 : In the two-particle unitarity cut of the four-point one-loop amplitude, legs l1
andl2are taken on-shell. The resulting dressed expression (summed over all graphs that can
contribute) should be equal to the product of tree-amplitudes summed over all physical states
that can cross the cut. The vertical dashed line simply indicates cutting the internal legs –
i.e. placing them on shell.
There are technicalities that can simplify both verification and construction with gauge
theory amplitudes. A primary one is the advantage of considering color-ordered cuts. As
color-ordered tree-amplitudes depend on at most an exponential number of graphs (compared
to a combinatorial number), a potentially vastly smaller number of graphs contribute to
color-ordered cuts rather than color-dressed cuts. As a concrete example we present here a
two-particle cut of four-point one-loop amplitude. This cut can be described as the product
between two four-point tree level amplitudes, as per Fig. 3. If this were a color-dressed cut
we would need to consider the contribution of nine graphs to the integrand, but here we
need only consider four-graphs. Why? Unitarity implies that the one-loop ordered integrand
evaluated with on-shell conditions for cut-legs be equal to the product of two ordered tree
level amplitudes summed over all physical states of the theory:
Aone-loop(a, b, c, d )|2-particle cut =X
si∈statesAtree(a, b, ls1
1, ls2
2)Atree(−l¯s2
2,−l¯s1
1, c, d) (2.13)
Since we are considering representations with only cubic topologies, we need only write down
– 8 –the trivalent graphs that contribute to each of the ordered amplitudes,
Γone-loop= Γtree
L⊗Γtree
R, (2.14)
where Γ are cubic graphs. If all of the channels at tree-level contribute, there are two graphs
for each of the ordered trees, and so their outer product generates four distinct one-loop
graphs dressed as per the integrand on the left hand side of Eqn. 2.13. We show these graphs
in Fig. 4.
It is necesary that any kinematic weights of the integrand this must satisfy the constraints
of this cut up to terms that must vanish upon integration. Here we insist on the sufficient
condition that the integrand simply satisfies cut constraints, which informs the parameters
of our ansatze. Once a spanning set of constraints have been consistently imposed on an in-
tegrand ansatz, any unconstrained parameters can not contribute to any physical observables.

Regarding the sum over physical states that can cross a cut, we now review the identities
and completeness relations used to simplify the right hand side of Eqn. 2.13. In this paper,
we impose on-shell cuts on both fermionic and gluonic propagators. We exploit the following
completeness relations for gluons,
X
s∈polsϵµ,s(k)ϵν,¯s(−k) =ηµν−kµqν+qµpν
k·q, (2.15)
and fermionic state sums:X
s∈statesv(−l, s)¯u(l,¯s) =/l+m . (2.16)
where qis an arbitrary reference null-vector. The freedom in qcorresponds to gauge-choice,
and as such any gauge-independent observable like an ordered amplitude must ultimately
– 9 –be independent of q. When the sewing of trees closes a fermion loop this will result in a
trace over the fermionic indices associated with that loop. While much of the literature for
unitarity methods goes hand in hand with spinor-helicity methods for compact expressions
in fixed dimensions, D-dimensional unitarity methods for massive particles has a relatively
venerable legacy, e.g. [3].
In any calculations with fermions contributing via a closed loop we can employ trace
identities to canonicalize the resulting expressions. These critically depend on dimensions
and the nature of the fermions. In even dimensions, for Dirac fermions, the trace of odd
number of gamma matrices is zero, and for an even number of gamma matrices we have the
following recursive relation:
Tr(γµ1, γµ2, ..., γµn) =nX
k=2(−1)kηµ1µkTr(γµ1, ..., γµk−1, γµk+1, ..., γµn). (2.17)
Some familiar examples are for n= 2 and n= 4:
Tr(γµγν) = 2D/2×ηµν
Tr(γµγνγργσ) = 2D/2×(ηµνηρσ−ηµρηνσ+ηµσηνρ)(2.18)
One can use analogous relations for n= 6 and n= 8 to reduce expressions in our one-loop
calculations. As fermion traces dressing graphs are only matched against fermion traces in
cuts, the contribution of fermion traces can be left formal but for ease of comparison with
standard results we evaluate in even dimensions using the identities above.
A known difficulty for unitarity methods is to access any information that is only con-
tained in subtle or difficult to reach cuts such as forward limits – e.g. a tree sewn with itself
which will ofen need to be regulated. This is relevant at one-loop for tadpole diagrams or
snail-like corrections to external legs. We will not concern ourself with such contributions
in this paper, but point the interested reader to ref. [3] which describes how such diagrams
seperate from D-dimensional constructable contributions, and consideration of known UV
and IR behavior can be used to constrain any such resulting ambiguity.
3 Functional fermionic ansatze and conventions
In bosonic theories such as pure gluonic amplitudes or scalar non-linear sigma models, one
can construct an ansatz solely from Lorentz invariants depending only on momenta and any
required polarizations required for little-group scaling. The inclusion of fermions necessitates
the use of spinor bilinears such as ¯ u1γµv2in our ansatze as well.
Beside conservation of energy and transverse property of polarization vectors (i.e ki.ϵ(i)=
0) we require some identities between Gamma matrices, in Ddimensions, to reduce to a
– 10 –linearly minimal basis of dimensionally appropriate terms.
γµγµ=D , (3.1)
γµγνγµ=−(D−2)γν, (3.2)
γµγνγργµ= 4ηνρ−(4−D)γνγρ, (3.3)
γµγνγργσγµ=−2γσγργν+ (4−D)γνγργσ, (3.4)
γµγν+γνγµ= 2ηµν. (3.5)
In addition, we can exploit the Dirac equation to simplify some combinations of spinor and
momenta:
¯u1(/k1−m) = 0 , (/k2+m)v2= 0. (3.6)
In general, our amplitudes will consist of quark-antiquark pairs as well as gluons. For
little group scaling, we require each term in our ansatz to have a ¯ uifor every external fermion,
avjfor every external anti-fermion, and a polarization vector for every external gluon. The
maximum number of gamma matrices we need to include is equal to the sum of the number
of fermionic vertices plus the number of fermionic propagators. Then, using independent
momenta, we construct an ansatz with the correct mass dimension. If we have expressions for
maximally distinct number of fermion flavors, we can always easily build expressions where
some of our quark-anti-quark pairs share the same flavor. As such, we consider each pair
as having a different flavor in our amplitudes. In this paper, we construct a general ansatz
for a minimal basis of graphs (under the duality between color and kinematics), then we fix
coefficients via any remaining color-dual constraints and cut conditions.
The kinematic numerators for graphs with pairs of quark-antiquark are constructed from
spinor bilinears. In general, these take the form:
¯u1γµ1...γµnv2 (3.7)
where we run from anti-particle 2¯ȷto particle 1ialong the fermionic line.
We use a convention where we assume the momenta of all particles are outgoing,P
iki=
0. Any arrows on graphs are used to label external quarks and antiquarks and the fermionic
line connecting them, not momentum flow. As such, we dress the outgoing fermion 1iwith the
¯u1spinor solution to the Dirac equation, and the outgoing anti-fermion, 2¯ȷ, with the v2spinor
solution. We leave fermionic color-indices unbarred, and bar the anti-fermionic color-indices
as a notational convenience.
3.1 Swapping fermions and anti-fermions within a pair
Consider the two graphs in Fig. 5. These contribute to scattering involving two distinct
quark-anti-quark pairs with an external gluon. They have the same topologies except quark-
antiquark particles 1iand 2¯ȷhave been swapped. Fermion kinematics work differently for
particles and anti-particles so in kinematic dressings we can not swap particles with antipar-
ticles by simply exchanging labels. But of course, assuming underlying Feynman rules (as
– 11 –there are for QCD), the dressings of the two graphs must be functionally related, and we
can exploit these relations to give the overall topology a canonical dressing for a canonical
ordering of particle-antiparticle in each fermionic line, and then appropriately manipulate
that dressing to relabel particles and anti-particles as necessary.

Figure 5 : Graphs with topologies differing only by the direction of one fermion line. Their
kinematics weights not simply related by a trivial relabeling. Rather we track such book
keeping by applying an R1¯2operation to the kinematic weight (see Eqn. 3.8).
Schematically, the difference in dressing the two diagrams of Fig. 5 is that the path
between pair {1i,2¯ȷ}is reversed. So, any relabeling from one to the other will want to reverse
the order of Gamma matrices in the bilinear dressing. A subtle difference in this reversing
procedure is flipping the direction of propagators. This implies that we need to flip the sign
of the mass of the particle anywhere it explicitly appears in the expression. Functionally, the
momenta of particle 1iand antiparticle 2¯ȷshould be swapped in such dressings.
In general, if two graphs, ( a) and ( b), only differ by reversing the fermion path between
quark 1 and it’s antiquark ¯2, as per the graphs in Fig. 5, we impose the following functional
relation between their kinematic weights:

The most familiar setting to see how this rule plays out may be e−e+→γγ. There are
two diagrams that contribute. In our convention, with incoming electron with momenta −k1,
incoming positron with momenta −k2, and outgoing photons with momenta k3andk4, the
t= (k1+k4)2channel would be dressed with standard Feynman rules to have kinematic
weight given,
n

2¯
≡nt= ¯u1/ϵ4(/k1+/k4+m)/ϵ3v2. (3.10)
– 12 –Traditionally one might read off the u= (k1+k3)2-channel then by simply exchanging labels
k3↔k4,

1i3 4
2¯
≡nu= ¯u1/ϵ3(/k1+/k3+m)/ϵ4v2 (3.11)
It is not difficult to see Eqn. 3.11 and Eqn. 3.10 are equivalently related by the reordering
rule of Eqn. 3.9:
nt=R12nu
=−¯u1/ϵ4(/k2+/k3−m)/ϵ3v2
= ¯u1/ϵ4(/k1+/k4+m)/ϵ3v2. (3.12)
In the final line we have simply used conservation of momentum to replace k2=−k1−k3−k4.
When tracking edge order around vertices, as one is required to do for adjoint represen-
tations, a quark-antiquark vertex that has order: {anti-fermion, fermion, gluon }is considered
distinct from one that has order {fermion, anti-fermion, gluon }– they are related only by
a non-cyclic permutation. As we are free to introduce complementary phases between color
and kinematics, we find it convenient to introduce adjunct fundamental generators to allow
an antisymmetric dressing of such distinct quark-antiquark vertices in concordance with the
antisymmetry of dressing acyclically related adjoint vertices:
Ta
¯ȷi≡ −Ta
i¯ȷ⇐⇒ fcab=−fbac. (3.13)
This means that the kinematics for quark-antiquark-glue, n(g, f, ¯f) should be dressed with
a minus sign relative to the kinematics of an antiquark-quark-glue n(g,¯f, f), so that either
graph could be used in writing down the full color-dressed amplitude:
A(fi,¯f¯ȷ, ga) =Ta
¯ȷin(g, f, ¯f) =Ta
i¯ȷn(g,¯f, f). (3.14)
So, somewhat trivially, we can see how the sign in our definition of Rallows this convenience:
¯u/ϵv=n(g,¯f, f)
=−n(g, f, ¯f)
=−Rf¯f 
n(g,¯f, f)
=−(−¯u/ϵv).
A nice example of how functional reordering can be useful involves minimizing the nec-
essary basis graphs at loop-level. This is familiar from adjoint representations of bosons. For
– 13 –example, the following equation depicts a Jacobi relation between box and triangle diagrams,
12 3
4
−
12 4
3 =
123
4 (3.15)
The numerators for the two box diagrams can be related by simply swapping the labels of leg
3 and 4.
However, for fermions in the fundamental representation, simple relabeling is not an
option. However we can use the reordering operator of Eqn. 3.8 to relate the box numerators
in the following analogous Jacobi-like equation,
1i2¯3k
4¯ll
−
1i2¯4¯l
3kl =
1i2¯ 3k
4¯ll (3.16)
We can write down the relation between kinematic weights in graphs in Eqn. 3.15 and
3.16 as:
N□−N□|3↔4=N△(for graph relation 3.15)
N□− R3¯4(N□) =N△(for graph relation 3.16)(3.17)
3.2 Swapping (anti) fermion labels between pairs of the same-flavor
Consider the two diagrams which contribute to Bhabha scattering:
A/Q2=n


43

(k1+k2)2+n

14
23

(k1+k4)2(3.18)
with Qstanding in for the normalized charge of the scattering particles. The only difference
between the two graphs is the exchange of external outgoing momenta k2↔k4between
the same type of external particles. Famously, for Dirac-Fermi statistics we must be able to
account for a relative minus sign between contributions to the exchange. We can do so with
the traditional signature around argument labels involving identical particle (same flavor)
pairs:
n(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f) = sig(1 f,2¯f,3f,4¯f)¯u1γµv2¯u3γµv4 (3.19)
To avoid cluttering expressions we will keep such signatures implicit for the most part, but
wish to emphasize for readers the importance of tracking such exchanges.
– 14 –4 Tree level QCD amplitudes, massless fermions
We begin with massless fermions for simplicity and to better emphasize what small changes
occur when considering fermions of generic masses per flavor.
4.1 Three-point amplitudes
The three-point two-fermion amplitude is the simplest case. Since there is no propagator in
this case the numerator should have mass dimension one. The only ansatz we can write down
consistent with our rules is as follows,
n

1i
2¯3
≡n(1f,2¯f,3A) = ¯u1/ϵ3v2. (4.1)
Note that if we replace the polarization vector with the corresponding momentum, the nu-
merator will vanish via conservation of momentum. This is not surprising because there is
only one independent diagram contributing to the amplitude so the kinematic weight must
be gauge-invariant by itself.
The on-shell three-point amplitude for external kinematics k1, k2, k3is thus given by:
A(1i
f,2¯ȷ
¯f,3a
A) =g Ta
¯ȷin(1f,2¯f,3A) (4.2)
where we have chosen to set the coupling to g.
Bootstrapping the three-point gluon amplitude via the duality between color and kine-
matics has been discussed previously, see e.g. [6, 17], so we simply quote here for completeness
and easy reference that imposing antisymmetry on a minimal basis of the appropriate mass
dimension reproduces exactly what imposing gauge-invariance does on the same ansatz:
n

1
23
≡n(1A,2A,3A)∝(ϵ1·ϵ2) ((k1−k2)·ϵ3) + cyclic , (4.3)
with the associated three-point gluon amplitude simply given as:
A(1a
A,2b
A,3c
A) =gfabcn(1A,2A,3A). (4.4)
Strictly speaking at this stage the gluon coupling could be allowed to float from the fermion
coupling but consistency of factorization of higher point amplitudes fixes them to be identical.
– 15 –4.2 Four-point amplitudes with two distinct massless fermionic pairs
In this case, the amplitude should be dimensionless and the numerator must have mass
dimension two. We have two distinct fermionic pairs, say {{1f,2¯f},{3f,4¯f}}and thus only
one non-vanishing topology, Fig. 6.
1i2¯3k
4¯l
Figure 6 : The only topology that can contribute with two distinct-flavor fermion pairs
scattering at four-point tree-level.
Like the three-point quark-antiquark example, we can only write down one term for the
kinematic numerator of this graph consistent with our rules and this mass dimension:
n(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f) = (¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4) (4.5)
The ordered and color-dressed amplitudes are simply,
A(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f) =n(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f)
s12(4.6)

f,2¯ȷ

f,4¯l¯f) =g2Ta
i¯ȷTa
k¯lA(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f) (4.7)
with sij= (ki+kj)2.
This amplitude respects the only non-trivial ordered cut to three-point amplitudes:
X
s∈statesA(1f,2¯f, lA,s)A(−lA,¯s,3f,4¯f) = lim
s12→0s12A(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f) =n(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f)|s12→0
(4.8)
The sum over physical gluonic states (physical polarizations) is carried out by use of the
gluonic completeness relation mentioned in Eqn. 2.15.
It will be useful to see how this works in detail as related cuts will be used continu-
ously throughout this paper. As ordered amplitudes at three-points are simply the kinematic
numerators for the correctly oriented graphs (no propagators), we begin by substituting nu-
– 16 –merators for ordered amplitudes on the LHS using Eqn. 4.1
X
s∈statesA(1f,2¯f, lA,s)A(−lA,¯s,3f,4¯f) =X

where the third line follows from Eqn. 2.15, and the fourth line follows from ¯ u1/lv2= 0 and
¯u3/lv4= 0. We see this is exactly n(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f) from Eqn. 4.5 so our cut in Eqn. 4.8 is
satisfied.

Figure 7 : There are two channels contributing to a four-point fermion tree-level amplitude
if both pairs are the same flavor of Dirac fermions.
If both pairs of fermions are of the same flavor we still have only one topology but now
two channels contribute, see Fig. 7. We simply add two channels to the amplitude:
g−2A(1i

k¯ln(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f)

k¯ȷn(1f,4¯f,3f,2¯f)
s14(4.13)
There would generically be two ordered amplitudes in this case, the ordered amplitude of
Eqn. 4.6, and
A(1f,4¯f,3f,2¯f) =n(1f,4¯f,3f,2¯f)
s14(4.14)
This is fine and holds in D-dimensions.
4.3 An adjoint example of dimensional constraints.
Everything has been D-dimensional and we have run into no constraints that require us to
choose a dimension in order to satisfy the duality between color and kinematics. If it were
otherwise we would see functional constraints on the nature of the spinors. This agnostic
attitude towards Ddimensions will remain the case as long as we remain with Dirac fermions
in the fundamental. If we insist on an adjoint representations for Dirac fermions, however, we
will see that the duality between color and kinematics starts drawing us towards dimensional
constraints on the behavior of the spinors consistent with supersymmetry. To see what
– 17 –a dimensional constraint would look like, it is therefore instructive to consider the same
flavor case corresponding to the adjoint. Towards more familiar notation let us identify
corresponding adjoint color-indices a1=i,a2= ¯ȷ,a3=k, and a4=¯l. This has
Ta
i¯lTa
k¯ȷ→fa1a2efea3a4=cs (4.15)
Ta
i¯ȷTa
k¯l→fa1a4efea3a2=ct. (4.16)
The full color-dressed amplitude in this case is:
A=csn(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f)
s+ctn(1f,4¯f,3f,2¯f)
t. (4.17)
Note that this representation is written in the A(1σ3) Kleiss-Kujif basis [39, 40] so we can
simply read off from the full amplitude the two adjoint ordered amplitudes by the coefficients
ofc¯s≡f12efe43=−cs, and c¯t≡f14efe23=−ct,
A(1243) = −n(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f)
s12, (4.18)
A(1423) = −n(1f,4¯f,3f,2¯f)
s14. (4.19)
To rewrite in the more familiar A(1σ4) basis one exploits that ct=cs−cuto write:
A=csn(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f)
s12+n(1f,4¯f,3f,2¯f)
s14
+cu
−n(1f,4¯f,3f,2¯f)

(4.20)
with ordered amplitudes:
A(1234) =n(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f)
s12+n(1f,4¯f,3f,2¯f)
s14(4.21)
A(1324) = −n(1f,4¯f,3f,2¯f)
s14=A(1423) (4.22)
Note this satisfies adjoint Kleiss-Kujif identities such as A(1234) = −A(1243) −A(1423), as
well as the so called Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations [4, 5] for adjoint amplitudes:
A(1234)
s13=A(1243)
s14=A(1423)
s12(4.23)
This equality follows from:
nt=ns−nu (4.24)
n(1f,4¯f,3f,2¯f) =n(1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f)−0 (4.25)
(¯u1γµv4)(¯u3γµv2) =
−1 =sig(1234)
sig(1432)
(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4) (4.26)
where for clarity we have made explicit the usually implicit same-flavor Fermionic signatures
described in Section 3.2. One may recognize the final equality as a familiar four-dimensional
– 18 –Fierz identity satisfied by our all outgoing convention and conservation of helicity. E.g. for
spins (+1
2,−1
2,+1
2,−1
2):
(¯u+1γµv−2)(¯u+3γµv−4) = 2⟨24⟩[13] (4.27)
(¯u+1γµv−4)(¯u+3γµv−2) = 2⟨42⟩[13] = −2⟨24⟩[13] (4.28)
We see the emergence of dimensional constraints from imposing the duality between color
and kinematics in the adjoint. The only way color and kinematics can be satisfied for adjoint
Dirac fermions is if we are in a dimension where the Fierz identity holds.
We gain more freedom if we allow for Majorana fermions. In this case we admit an ad-
ditonal channel, with potentially non-vanishing nu, kklaxing the color-dual kinematic Jacobi
to be:
0 = (¯ u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4) + (¯u1γµv4)(¯u3γµv2) + (¯u1γµv3)(¯u2γµv4). (4.29)
This, and the analogous condition for pseudo-Majarona spinors, can only be satisfied in
dimensions 3 ,4,6 and 10 – those that admit supersymmetry [41].
It is gratifying to see that graphs can carry the same color-dual kinematic dressings inde-
pendent of whether the fermions transform in the adjoint or the fundamental – what changes
are simply what graphs are allowed to contribute. This speaks to a suggestive universality of
minimal kinematic building blocks – at least at tree-level.
4.4 Four-point amplitudes with two external gluons and one massless fermionic
pair
In the case of only one fermionic pair at tree-level four-point scattering, just as in pure
gluonic scattering, we have three non-vanishing diagrams, Fig. 2. We distinguish between
two different topologies. The first, with a fermionic propagator, is used for the s=s12and
u=s13channels, and the second, with a gluonic propagator, which encodes the t=s14
channel. The duality between color and kinematics relates these topologies to each other,
cs=Ta
i¯ȷTb
j¯k, c u=Tb
i¯ȷTa
j¯k, c t=fabcTc
i¯k
cs−cu−ct= 0⇔ns−nu−nt= 0(4.30)
We therefore need only give the fermionic propagator graph a kinematic ansatz. Here are all
independent possible terms consistent with our general rules:
basis = {(k1·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2,(k4·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2,(k1·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2,
(k3·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2,(ϵ3·ϵ4)¯u1/k3v2,¯u1/ϵ3/k3/ϵ4v2} (4.31)
Our ansatz for the kinematic weight of the basis graph with a fermionic propagator is therefore
given as,
n(1f,3A,4A,2¯f) =a1(k1·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2+a2(k4·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2+a3(k1·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2
+a4(k3·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2+a5(ϵ3·ϵ4)¯u1/k3v2+a6¯u1/ϵ3/k3/ϵ4v2(4.32)
– 19 –where the aiare free parameters to be constrained by color-dual identities and factorization.
The quickest way to fix this ansatz is by considering the s13cut of the ordered amplitude3
A(1f,3A,4A,2¯f)
lim
s13→0s13A(1f,3A,4A,2¯f) =n(1f,3A,4A,2¯f)|s13→0. (4.33)
This must be equal to sewing two three-point trees on-shell together as follows,
X
s∈statesA(1f,3A, ls)A(−¯l¯s,4A,2¯f) = ¯u1/ϵ3(/k1+/k3)/ϵ4v2. (4.34)
In the last equality we employ the spinor completeness relation of Eqn. 2.16. This fixes all
coefficients in our ansatz yielding both
n

1i3 4
2¯
≡n(1f,3A,4A,2¯f) = 2( k1·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2+ ¯u1/ϵ3/k3/ϵ4v2(4.35)
and with the swap of 3 ↔4,
n

1i4 3
2¯
≡n(1f,4A,3A,2¯f) = 2( k1·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2+ ¯u1/ϵ4/k4/ϵ3v2.(4.36)
We can get the numerator for the final graph, (c) of Fig. 2, from the Jacobi-like relation:
n(2¯f,1f,3A,4A) =n(1f,3A,4A,2¯f)−n(1f,4A,3A,2¯f)
= 2(( k3·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2−(k4·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2−(ϵ3·ϵ4)¯u1/k3v2) (4.37)
Note we could have gotten the dressing for this last topology directly by constraining
an ansatz given to that graph. It is perhaps pedagogically useful to see how we arrive at
this very same dressing, for this graph, by consideration of this graph’s properties alone. We
could e.g. start by assigning a minimal ansatz to this numerator:
n(2¯f,1f,3A,4A) =a1(k1·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2+a2(k4·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2+a3(k1·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2
+a4(k3·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2+a5(ϵ3·ϵ4)¯u1/k3v2+a6¯u1/ϵ3/k3/ϵ4v2(4.38)
3These ordered amplitudes have already been given in terms of dressed cubic graphs as an example in the
previous section Eqn. 2.8.
– 20 –The duality between color and kinematics requires that the numerator to be anti-symmetric
under swapping two adjacent gluons:
n(2¯f,1f,4A,3A) =−n(2¯f,1f,3A,4A) = (a1−2a6)(k1·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2+ (a2−2a6)(k4·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2
+ (a3−2a6)(k1·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2+ (a4+ 2a6)(k3·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2
+ (a5+ 2a6)(ϵ3·ϵ4)¯u1/k3v2+a6¯u1/ϵ3/k3/ϵ4v2
This imposes a6= 0, a1=−a3anda2=−a4. The next constraint comes from flipping the
fermions. Recalling the adjunct antisymmetry introduced in the color-weights and comple-
mentary phase we have:
n(1f,2¯f,3A,4A) =−
n(2¯f,1f,3A,4A)≡ R1¯2 
n(1f,2¯f,3A,4A)
=a1 
(k2·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2−(k2·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2) +a2((k3·ϵ4)¯u1/ϵ3v2−(k4·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2
+a5(ϵ3·ϵ4)¯u1/k3v2
The above equation implies a1= 0. Then we impose the gauge invariance on the maximal
cut targeting this graph (so s34must vanish):
n(2¯f,1f,3A,4A)|s34→0,ϵ3→k3= 0
This implies a2=−a5. So, for this graph, considering its properties alone, we have recovered
Eqn. 4.37 derived from color-dual kinematic relations.
4.5 Five-point amplitudes with one gluon and two massless fermionic pairs
In the case of five points with two distinct fermionic pairs, we have five non-vanishing graphs,
Fig. 8. The color factor for each graph is:
c(a)=Ta
i¯mTb
m¯ȷTb
k¯l
c(b)=Ta
¯ȷmTb
¯miTb
k¯l=Ta
m¯ȷTb

c(d)=Ta¯lmTb
¯mkTb
i¯ȷ=Ta
m¯lTb
k¯mTb
i¯ȷ
c(e)=Tc
i¯ȷfcabTb
k¯l(4.39)
The duality between color and kinematics relates color and kinematic weights for different
graphs:
c(a)−c(b)=c(e)⇔n(a)−n(b)=n(e)
c(c)−c(d)=−c(e)⇔n(c)−n(b)=−n(e)(4.40)
– 21 –So the full color-dressed amplitude can be written:
g−3A=c(a)n(a)
s15s34+c(b)n(b)
s25s34+c(c)n(c)
s35s12+c(d)n(d)

where for the second equality we expressed the full amplitude in terms of a minimal color basis
by exploiting c(d)=c(a)−c(b)+c(c)andc(e)=c(a)−c(b), defining ordered (color-stripped)
amplitudes of the coefficients of the remaining independent color-weights.

Figure 8 : Five distinct topologies for tree-level scattering with two fermionic pairs and one
gluon.
As we discussed in 3.1, graphs ( a) and ( b) in Fig. 8 (similarly graphs ( c) and ( d)) are
related to each other by reordering rules, Eqn. 3.9. So, there is just one basis graph we can
dress functionally. The numerators should have mass dimension three, since amplitudes in
this case have dimension [ mass ]−1, and we have two propagators in each diagram. Each term
must have two ¯ uicorresponding to outgoing fermions and two vicorresponding to outgoing
anti-fermions. We also need a polarization vector for the external gluon and a momentum to
get the correct dimension. Our ansatz will have 11 terms, which can be clustered into three
types:
1. The general structure for this type is (¯ uiγµvj)(¯upγµvq)km·ϵ5. We have three independent
– 22 –terms here:
{(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4)(k1·ϵ5),(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4)(k2·ϵ5),(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4)(k3·ϵ5)}
2. The general structure of this type is (¯ ui/kmvj)(¯up/ϵ5vq) and we have four different terms:
{(¯u1/k3v2)(¯u3/ϵ5v4),(¯u3/k1v4)(¯u1/ϵ5v2),(¯u1/k4v2)(¯u3/ϵ5v4),(¯u3/k2v4)(¯u1/ϵ5v2)}
3. This case is a little bit more complicated than the previous cases since we have four Gamma
matrices, (¯ uiγµvj)(¯up/km/ϵ5γµvq) There are four independent terms:
{(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3/k1/ϵ5γµv4),(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3/k2/ϵ5γµv4),
(¯u3γµv4)(¯u1/k3/ϵ5γµv2),(¯u3γµv4)(¯u1/k4/ϵ5γµv2)}
First of all, we impose the following functional constraint between numerators n(a)andn(c)
by flipping adjacent fermions:
n(1f,5A,2¯f,3f,4¯f) =−
n(1f,5A,2¯f,4¯f,3f)≡ R3¯4 
n(1f,5A,2¯f,3f,4¯f)
(4.43)
This constraint fixes 3 coefficients. To fix the remaining coefficients, we simply impose the
ordered cut condition:
X
s∈statesA(1f,5A,¯l¯s)A(−ls,2¯f,3f,4¯f) = lim
s15→0s15A(a)(1f,5A,2¯f,3f,4¯f) (4.44)
=n(1f,5A,2¯f,3f,4¯f)

With ordered lower point amplitudes from earlier in the boostrap quoted,
A(1f,5A,¯l) =−A(1f,¯l,5A) =−¯u1/ϵ5vl (4.46)
A(−l,2¯f,3f,4¯f) =(¯u−lγµv2)(¯u3γµv4)

We evaluate the state sum using the completeness relation, Eqn. 2.16, yielding

– 23 –The above constraint fixes all the remaining coefficients. So, the numerator for graphs
(a) and (c) is given functionally by:
n(1f,5A,2¯f,3f,4¯f) = (¯u3γµv4)(¯u1/k3/ϵ5γµv2) + (¯u3γµv4)(¯u1/k4/ϵ5γµv2)

(4.50)
with
n(a)=n(1f,5A,2¯f,3f,4¯f) (4.51)
n(c)=n(3f,5A,4¯f,1f,2¯f). (4.52)
The other numerators follow from:
n(b)=R1¯2n(a), (4.53)
n(d)=R3¯4n(c), (4.54)
n(e)=n(a)−n(b)=n(d)−n(c). (4.55)
It is straightforward to verify our results against Feynman rules as well as known SYM
amplitudes after taking the color-weights to the adjoint and fixing helicities.

Similar to the pure gluon amplitudes at five-point , we have fifteen cubic graphs as depicted
Fig. 9. We just need to know the numerator for one of them. By Jacobi-like relations,

The Jacobi-like relations between these graphs are:

c(a)−c(c)=−c(j)↔n(a)−n(c)=−n(j)
c(e)−c(f)=−c(k)↔n(e)−n(f)=−n(k)

c(a)−c(b)+c(e)−c(f)=−c(o)↔n(a)−n(b)+n(e)−n(f)=−n(o)(4.57)

– 26 –This amplitude is more complicated than previous examples because we have more terms. In
addition, canonical ordering of the spinor chain is more cumbersome.
We begin by identifying the kinematics building blocks for constructing our ansatz. From
dimensional analysis the mass dimension of numerators is three in D= 4. We have one
particle and one antiparticle. So, we should include one ¯ uand one v. To get the correct mass
dimension, we need to include two momenta. In addition, each polarization vector should
show up once. There are 87 independent terms for the ansatz. We categorize them into seven
sets:
1. ¯u1/ϵ3/ϵ4/ϵ5/k3/k4v2, in this case we just have one term. Any other orderings reduce to this
term plus other terms we will include.
2. ¯u1/ϵ3/ϵ4/ϵ5v2(k1·k2), there are five terms like this in our basis.
3. ¯u1/ϵ3/ϵ4/k3v2(k1·ϵ5), there are eighteen independent terms similar to this in our basis.
4. ¯u1/ϵ3/k3/k4v2(ϵ4·ϵ5), there are three independent terms similar to this in our basis.
5. ¯u1/ϵ3v2(k1·k2)(ϵ4·ϵ5), there are fifteen independent terms similar to this in our basis.
6. ¯u1/ϵ3v2(ϵ4·k1)(ϵ5·k2), there are twenty seven independent terms similar to this in our
basis.
7. ¯u1/k3v2(ϵ3·k1)(ϵ4·ϵ5), there are eighteen independent terms similar to this in our basis.
Imposing Constraints: We start by imposing cut constraints on a fermionic propaga-
tor:
X
s∈statesA(5A,1f,4A, ls)A(−¯l¯s,2¯f,3A) = lim
s23→0s23A(a)(5A,1f,4A,2¯f,3A) (4.59)
On the LHS, we have lower point ordered amplitudes which we already fixed. On the RHS,
only two terms survive in this limit. So, we come up with the following constraint:
n(a)
s14+n(b)
s15
s23→0=¯u1/ϵ4(/k1+/k4)/ϵ5(/k2+/k3)/ϵ3v2
s14+¯u1/ϵ5(/k1+/k5)/ϵ4(/k2+/k3)/ϵ3v2
s15
The above constraint leaves us with two unknown coefficients. We can use gluonic cut con-
straint:
X
s∈statesA(1f,2¯f, ls)A(−l−s,3A,4A,5A) = lim
s12→0s12A(o)(1f,2¯f,3A,4A,5A) (4.60)
This relation fixes another coefficient and we are left with just one unfixed coefficient remain-
ing. This remaining coefficient, we call a0does not show up in any gauge-invariant observables
– 27 –and so represents total generalized gauge freedom. Eqn. 4.61 shows the basis numerator from
which all the others follow from linear relations:

Where a0is an unfixed parameter representing generalized gauge freedom, which cancels
out in any physical observables like ordered or color-dressed amplitudes. One can check
that the above numerator is not same as the numerator that we find from Feynman rules in
Feynman gauge, but the requisite ordered amplitudes are the same.
4.7 Massless six-point amplitudes with three fermionic pairs
This case is simpler than the previous one because we just have external fermions. The
mass dimension of amplitude must be −2 inD= 4, and because we have three propagators,
our numerators have mass dimension four. We need three ¯ uiand three vicorresponding to
fermions and antifermions, respectively. Like the five-point case, we include one momentum
to get the correct mass dimension. We have seven non-vanishing diagrams, Fig. 10. The color

where in the second equality we wrote down terms in the minimal color basis.
The structure of the first six graphs are the same. If we can fix the numerator for one
graph, by relabeling we can get the others. We have two types of terms in our ansatz in this
case:
1. The general structure of these terms is (¯ uiγµvj)(¯upγµvq)(¯um/klvn). There are nine
independent terms:
{(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4)(¯u5/k2v6),(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4)(¯u5/k3v6),(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4)(¯u5/k4v6),

(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γρv4)(¯u5γµ/k2γρv6),(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γρv4)(¯u5γµ/k3γρv6),

(¯u3γµv4)(¯u5γρv6)(¯u1γµ/k5γρv2)	
The quickest approach to fixing the ansatz is simply by applying cut constraints to one
of the smaller ordered amplitudes:
X
s∈statesA(1f,¯l¯s,3f,4¯f)A(−ls,2¯f,5f,6¯f) = lim
s134→0s134A(a)(1f,3f,4¯f,5f,6¯f,2¯f)
=n(1f,3f,4¯f,5f,6¯f,2¯f)
s34s56|s134→0(4.71)
Using Eqn. 4.6 we can write down the LHS as:
X
s∈states(¯u1γρvl,¯s)(¯u3γρv4)(¯u−l,sγµv2)(¯u5γµv6)
s34s56
l2→0=n(1f,3f,4¯f,5f,6¯f,2¯f)
s34s56
s134→0(4.72)
– 30 –Using the state sum relation for spinors, we will come up with a simple equation:
n(1f,3f,4¯f,5f,6¯f,2¯f) = (¯u1γµ(/k3+/k4)γρv2)(¯u3γµv4)(¯u5γρv6)
+ 2(¯u1γρv2)(¯u3/k1v4)(¯u5γρv6)(4.73)
By relabeling indices and applying color-kinematic duality, we can get other diagrams. This
result is consistent with [10].
5 Tree level QCD amplitudes, massive cases
For massive fermions, we have the same constraining relations for three-point and four-point
with two fermionic pairs and symbolically the same ansatz building blocks. Our expressions
change only by the meaning of the spinors – they now satisfy the solution to the massive Dirac
equations. As a result the amplitudes are otherwise trivially the same. The first difference
in ansatz building blocks between the expressions between massless and massive cases is at
four-point with one fermionic pair and two gluons. The first time we will see actually distinct
amplitudes at tree-level is at five-points.
5.1 Four-point amplitudes with two gluons and one massive fermionic pair
We build up our ansatz precisely as in the massless cases described in the preceding sections,
except now we have access to a few more building blocks,
{k1·ϵ3¯u1/ϵ4v2, k4·ϵ3¯u1/ϵ4v2, k1·ϵ4¯u1/ϵ3v2, k3·ϵ4¯u1/ϵ3v2, ϵ3·ϵ4¯u1/k3v2,¯u1/ϵ3/ϵ4/k3v2,
m¯u/ϵ3/ϵ4v2, m¯u1v2ϵ3.ϵ4}.(5.1)
Imposing Jacobi-like relations, Eqn. 4.30, reordering rules for two adjacent fermions in the
third diagram in Fig. 2, and gauge invariance, fixes all coefficients up to an overall factor
which can be constrained by factorization. Here then is the first numerator in Fig. 2 and one
can get the others from this:
n(1f,3A,4A,2¯f) = 2( k1·ϵ3)¯u1/ϵ4v2+ ¯u1/ϵ3/k3/ϵ4v2 (5.2)
We see the above numerator is exactly the same as the massless case, Eqn. 4.35. So, in this
case we can also use same result for both massive and massless cases.
5.2 Five-point amplitudes with one gluon and two massive fermionic pairs
To build five-point amplitudes with two massive fermionic pairs, we must consider four addi-
tional types of terms in our ansatz, which would be zero in the massless limit. Again in this
case we will land on the same symbolic expression as the massless case. The four classes of
additional terms can be described as:
– 31 –1. Three terms similar to (¯ u1v2)(¯u3v4)(ka·ϵ5). (Why only three? Recall that k4=−k1−
k2−k3−k5sok4·ϵ5is spanned by having k1,2,3·ϵ5already in our ansatz.)
2. Three terms similar to (¯ u1γαγβv2)(¯u3γαγβv4)(ka·ϵ5).
3. Four terms similar to (¯ u1v2)(¯u3/k1/ϵ5v4).
4. Four terms of the form m1(¯u1v2)(¯u3/ϵ5v4).
The quickest way to fix the ansatz is from a single ordered cut. Similar to the massless case,
we have:
X
s∈statesA(1f,5A,¯l¯s)A(−ls,2¯f,3f,4¯f) = lim
s15→m2
1s15A(a)(1f,5A,2¯f,3f,4¯f) (5.3)
=n(1f,5A,2¯f,3f,4¯f)
s34|s15→m2
1. (5.4)
This cut fixes all coefficients in our ansatz and we have:
n(1f,5A,2¯f,3f,4¯f) = 2(¯ u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4)(k1·ϵ5)+
2(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4)(k2·ϵ5)−2(¯u3/k2v4)(¯u1/ϵ5v2)+ (5.5)
(¯u3γµv4)(¯u1/k3/ϵ5γµv2) + (¯u3γµv4)(¯u1/k4/ϵ5γµv2)
This is exactly Eqn. 4.51 which we derived for the massless case from a general ansatz. So,
again, we can use the above functional form both for massive and massless cases.
5.3 Five-point amplitudes with three gluons and one massive fermionic pair
The general ansatz in this case is similar to the massless case, we just need to add terms
proportional to morm2. The new terms proportional to m2are given,
basis m2={m2¯u1/ϵ3/ϵ4/ϵ5v2, m2¯u1/ϵ3v2(ϵ4·ϵ5), m2¯u1/ϵ4v2(ϵ3·ϵ5), m2¯u1/ϵ5v2(ϵ3·ϵ4)} (5.6)
Terms proportional to a single power of mbegin to proliferate, but we can categorize them
as follows:
1.m¯u1/ϵ3/ϵ4/ϵ5/k3v2, and m¯u1/ϵ3/ϵ4/ϵ5/k4v2.
2.m¯u1/ϵ3/ϵ4v2(k1·ϵ5), among nine independent terms like this.
3.m¯u1/ϵ3/k3v2(ϵ4·ϵ5), among six independent terms like this.
4.m¯u1v2(k1·ϵ3)(ϵ4·ϵ5), among nine independent terms like this.
Imposing the duality between color and kinematics reduces the number of basis graphs to
one. Graphically the ordered amplitudes can all be arranged as per Eqn. 4.58. All remaining
– 32 –freedom can either be fixed via unitarity cuts of ordered amplitudes or perhaps most simply
by imposing gauge invariance on a single ordered amplitude:
A(a)(1f,2¯f,3A,4A,5A)|ϵ3→k3= 0 (5.7)
Enforcing this constraint and matching with the massless result in the m→0 limit, we
achieve:
n(a)=n(1f,4A,5A,3A,2¯f) = ¯ u1/ϵ3/ϵ4/ϵ5/k3/k4v2−2¯u1/ϵ3/ϵ4/ϵ5v2k1·k2−2¯u1/ϵ3/ϵ4/ϵ5v2k1·k3−

5.4 Massive six-point amplitudes with three fermionic pairs
Like the previous example, we need to add terms to our ansatz which are zero in the massless
limit. There are nine categories:
1.m1(¯u1v2)(¯u3v4)(¯u5v6), there are three terms like this because of the three fermion
masses.
2. (¯u1v2)(¯u3v4)(¯u5/k2v6), there are nine terms like this.
3.m1(¯u1γµv2)(¯u3γµv4)(¯u5v6), there are nine terms like this.
4. (¯u1γµv2)(¯u3v4)(¯u5/k2γµv6), there are eighteen terms like this.
– 33 –5.m1(¯u1γµγνv2)(¯u3γµγνv4)(¯u5v6), there are nine terms like this.
6.m1(¯u1γµγνv2)(¯u3γµv4)(¯u5γνv6), there are nine terms like this.
7. (¯u1γµγνv2)(¯u3γµγνv4)(¯u5/k2v6), there are nine terms like this.
8. (¯u1γµγνv2)(¯u3γµv4)(¯u5/k2γνv6), there are eighteen terms like this.
9. (¯u1γµ/k3γνv2)(¯u3γµγνv4)(¯u5v6), there are eighteen terms like this.
Imposing cut constraints on the massive fermionic propagator as per,

fixes all the coefficients in our ansatz:
n(1f,3f,4¯f,5f,6¯f,2¯f) = (¯u1γµ(/k3+/k4)γρv2)(¯u3γµv4)(¯u5γρv6)
+ 2(¯u1γρv2)(¯u3/k1v4)(¯u5γρv6)(5.10)
We see that in this case, like the previous examples for massive amplitudes, we are allowed
to use the same ansatz for both massive and massless amplitudes, with no explicit mass
dependence.
6 One loop QCD amplitudes
In this section we turn to one-loop four-point calculations. We will build the integrand us-
ing similar techniques as tree level, then verify by comparing to known results. Namely we
begin by writing down a general ansatz for numerators at the integrand level, now including
dependence on l, the off-shell loop momentum. When closed loop states involve massive par-
ticles we will allow for both the on-shell mass of the particle and the off-shell l2to contribute
to the integrand of the ansatz. Imposing the duality between color and kinematics at the
integrand level as per Eqn. 2.11, which will allow us to reduce the number of independent
kinematic numerators – necessitating a far smaller ansatz than if we had dressed each graph
independently. Using unitarity cuts and symmetries of diagrams, we will see that we can
fix the coefficients in our ansatz up to pure generalized gauge terms that will cancel out in
any physical observable. Verification will proceed via integral reduction and comparison to
equivalent calculations preformed via Feynman rules. For ease of book-keeping we consider
ourselves in even dimensions when applying any spinor-trace identities, but will otherwise
leave dimension generic. In this work we focus on the traditionally cut-constructible aspects
of the integrand (excluding tadpoles and bubbles on external legs). As discussed in [3],
such contributions—while subtle to access from a unitarity perspective—seperate and can

verification of our calculation.

2respectively. We here
consider the case explicitly for Nf= 2, as additional flavors of fermions would only contribute
an overall-factor to the massive fermion bubble. With two distinct fermionic pairs we can
have six different topologies as drawn in Fig. 11. Indeed there are further distinct graphs from
swapping flavors for graphs 2,3,5, and 6, but their contributions are straightforwardly related
via relabeling. If there were no relations between kinematic weights we would need to write
down six different ansatze. Imposing the duality between color and kinematics functionally
imposes constraints which allow us to reduce to a smaller basis:

to specify n1,n3andn5as basis numerators. As per the discussion around Eqn. 3.9, the
operation Riȷapplies the appropriate fermionic relabeling for the fermionic pair {i, ȷ}. There

6.1.1 General ansatz
The mass dimension of the ansatz at this level is four. With four spinors, we require two
additional momenta to get the correct dimension. Since some graphs have four fermionic
vertices and two fermionic propagators, we can have six Gamma matrices at most. We
characterize the different available terms in the ansatz in Table 1.
The total number of independent terms are 76 and because we have three graphs in our
basis, we will start with 228 unknown coefficients to be constrained by cuts and color-dual
relations.

We start by imposing generalized unitarity cuts. Topologically there are four distinct ordered
cuts as drawn in see Fig. 12. The constraining data comes from the four-point ordered
amplitudes which we calculated in previous sections.
The simplest cut is the cut with two distinct cut fermions, cut (a) of Fig. 12, with only
– 37 –the graph topology (1) from Fig. 11 contributing:

but we can use the Jacobi relations between kinematic numerators to write them all in terms
of the kinematic weight of n1. These two cuts fix all coefficients in our ansatz for n1.
To constrain the terms in numerator 3, first we impose the cut depicted in Fig. 12(c):
X
s∈statesAtree[1m1

(l1+k2)2(k1+k2)2(6.6)
This cut fixes 68 coefficients. Additionally, from Eqn. 3.8, we have:
n3[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l] =−
n3[1f,2¯f,4¯f,3f, l]≡ R3¯4 
n3[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l]
. (6.7)
From flipping and relabeling momenta of n3[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l] we also have,
n3[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l] =
n3[2¯f,1f,4¯f,3f,−l−1f−2¯f]≡ R1¯2 
n3[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f,−l−1f−2¯f]
.
(6.8)
These considerations leave us with two unknown coefficients. To fix them, we impose the
three-particle cut depicted in Fig. 12(d):

To constrain the terms in numerator 5, we impose the cut in Fig. 12(c):
X
s∈statesAtree[¯lm1
2,s2,1m1
f,2m1¯f,¯lm1
1,s1]Atree[−¯lm1

f,4m2¯f] =n5[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l1]
((k1+k2)2)2(6.10)
– 38 –This cut fixes 68 coefficients. Similar to the Eqn. 6.7, we have:
n5[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l] =−
n5[1f,2¯f,4¯f,3f, l]≡ R3¯4 
n5[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l]
. (6.11)
The above constraint leaves us with four unknown coefficients. To fix them, note that in
n5[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l] we consider the massive fermionic loop that has same flavor as pair {1f,2¯f}.
It is possible to have a fermionic loop with same flavor as pair {3f,4¯f}. To distinguish them we
show the first one with n5[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l, m 1] and the second one with n5[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l, m 2].
We can define a new numerator N5[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l] =n5[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l, m 1]+n5[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l, m 2].
Symmetry of the diagram implies:
N5[1f,2¯f,3f,4¯f, l] =N5[3f,4¯f,1f,2¯f, l+ 1f+ 2 ¯f], (6.12)
which fixes the remaining freedom in n5.

It is straightforward to use momentum conservation to show that these are exactly what
one would expect from Feynman rules. This is not entirely surprising as, after all, there
are no contact term contributions demanding generalized freedom for these diagrams, but
we could have been required to distribute Jacobi-like zeros in the form of contacts that
would cancel between graphs for symmetry purposes. It is notable that the basis graphs
under color-kinematics duality can be dressed with Feynman rules and that that Jacobi-like
relations automatically propagate their information to the full amplitude. The expression
for all descendent numerators are available in the machine readable Mathematica form in
ancillary files associated with the arxiv version of this paper.

Figure 13 : Different topologies for four gluons with one massive fermionic loop, excluding
tadpole diagrams. The direction of the loop momentum as labeled is to be taken to the right
in each graph independent of the orientation of the spinor arrow.
Now we consider the case with external gluons and a massive fermionic loop of mass m. We
do not bother writing the contribution of internal gluon diagrams as these are known to be
color-dual and indeed have been constructed in the literature[45]. We need concern ourselves
with four different topologies, excluding any tadpole diagrams, Fig. 13.
The numerator of these topologies are related by the color-kinematics duality:
n2[1A,2A,3A,4A, l] =n1[1A,2A,3A,4A, l]−n1[1A,2A,4A,3A, l]
n3[1A,2A,3A,4A, l] =n2[1A,2A,3A,4A, l]−n2[2A,1A,4A,3A, l]
n4[1A,2A,3A,4A, l] =n2[1A,2A,3A,4A, l] +n2[1A,2A,4A,3A,−l−2](6.20)
We just have one basis graph and we choose the box diagram, n1, as our basis kinematic
numerator. There are three different classes of Lorentz invariants in our general ansatz:
1. (ϵi·ϵj)(ϵk·ϵl)(km·kn)(kp·kq), there are 84 terms like this.
2. (ϵi·ϵj)(kk·ϵl)(km·ϵn)(kp·kq), there are 378 terms like this.
3. (ki·ϵj)(kk·ϵl)(km·ϵn)(kp·ϵq), there are 81 terms like this.
So, there are 543 independent terms in our ansatz.

mirroring graphs:
n1[1A,2A,3A,4A, l] =n1[4A,1A,2A,3A, l+k2]

n1[1A,2A,3A,4A, l] =n1[2A,1A,4A,3A,−l](6.22)
These fix a further 169 coefficients, leaving us with 10 remaining coefficients parameterizing
a type of generalized gauge freedom. These cancel in any gauge-invariant quantity upon
integration.
6.2.2 Reduction to scalar integral basis
To compare with previous results in the literature it is conventient to express our results in
terms of scalar integral basis. It has been shown that in Ddimensions, one-loop amplitudes
can be expressed in terms of basis integrals4,

We will discuss how to go from our representation to the coefficients of basis integrals via
Passarino-Veltman reduction. As a simple example, consider a vector integral like:
ZdDl
(2π)Dlµ
l2(l−k1)2(l−k1−k2)2(l+k4)2
The only vectors we are allowed are external momenta, three of which are independent, so we
can write down the above integral as a linear combinations of coefficients of the three vectors,
ZdDl
(2π)Dlµ
l2(l−k1)2(l−k1−k2)2(l+k4)2=c1kµ
1+c2kµ
2+c3kµ
3,
where c(i)are scalar integrals. By dotting both side of the above equation, we arrive at three
equations which can be solved to find the c(i).
In our numerators, we have tensor integrals up to rank four and the reduction is more
complicated but proceeds apace. There exists many convenient software packages like Feyn-
Calc [42–44] which can be used to automate such reduction. After this reduction procedure,
one can read off the coefficients Ci
Dfor Eqn. 6.23. We include these in an ancillary file
associated with the arXiv version of this paper.
6.2.3 Ordered amplitudes
To verify our construction, we want to write down ordered amplitudes at one-loop. For four
external gluons with a massive fundamental fermion in the loop, we can write down the full
amplitude [3]:
Mone−loop(1,2,3,4) = g4µ2ϵ

tion color matrices (normalized as tr( TaTb) =δab), and A(. . .) represents the various ordered
amplitudes. The sum is over all non-cyclic permutations of the indices σ(n). With this de-
composition, just Feynman diagrams with a fixed cyclic ordering of external legs contribute
to ordered amplitudes. For example, A(1A,2A,3A,4A) would be (excluding tadpole and snail
diagrams):

(6.26)
Where niare the numerators for diagrams in Fig. 13 we calculated in Section 6.2.1. After
Passarino-Veltman reduction, we recover the coefficients needed for Eqn. 6.23. An important
check at this stage is to verify the gauge invariance of amplitude, after reduction to a minimal
color and integral basis, which we have preformed.
We additionally verified our results numerically against the results provided in [3] for
various helicity configurations taking the external gluons to four dimensions. For instance,
for all plus gluons, all coefficients of basis integrals vanish except for the box integral and in
spinor-helicity language it is:
C□=2i
16π2[12][34]
⟨12⟩⟨34⟩m4. (6.27)
This is a very sharp check that we have correctly accounted for D-dimensional data crossing
the cuts as such rational terms are famously inaccessible via four-dimensional cut construc-
tion [3].
There is a nice additional check of this approach, which is to consider the analogous
calculation with a massive scalar running around the loop. We leave the details of the
analogous scalar calculation to Appendix A, but quote the results for all gluons taken with
external plus-helicity,

Eqn. 6.27.
7 Summary and Conclusion
In this paper, we have established that color-kinematics can be a tool for actual quantum
chromodynamics at the integrand level. Unlike related previous double-copy work which fixes
the coefficients of the one-loop integral basis in either the gauge theory or double-copy gravity
theory via unitarity5, e.g. Refs. [49, 50], here we find color-dual gauge theory integrands at
four-points involving massive Dirac fermions in the fundamental. The integrands satisfy D-
dimensional cuts as well as the duality between color and kinematics. As we show, unitarity
cuts and imposing the duality between color and kinematics are sufficient constraints to fix
the gauge-invariant amplitudes. Specifically, we start with the three-point graph and produce
tree level amplitudes up through six-points, as well as the four-point one-loop amplitudes
with external fermions as well as four external gluons with a massive fermion and scalar loop
particle. We verify all amplitudes against known results from Feynman rules. While individual
graphs may be dressed differently than from Feynman gauge, indeed we only employ cubic
graphs, all gauge invariant observables are equal.
We understand the UV behavior of QCD so it is sufficient [3] to control the IR by
hand according to the renormalization scheme we are interested in. We can therefore be
content, especially at one-loop, to generate the integrands relevant to d-dimensional cut-
construction as we do here – requiring only that they satisfy the requisite physical cuts, and
defer contributions that can be delicate for unitarity such as tadpoles and bubbles on external
legs, often called snails, to other consideration. However we can aspire to something more
– color-kinematics relates the weights of graphs. It has the potential to transport physical
information consistently from graphs that are trivial to access via unitarity methods to graphs
that are not. This is by no means trivial. The book-keeping required to handle tadpoles and
snails in concordance with color-kinematics is still being developed, e.g. Refs. [45, 51–54]. We
expect this to be an important avenue in future investigation.
It is intriguing6to note that the kinematic weights of individual color-dual graphs were
independent of the nature of the color-dressing being in the fundamental or adjoint. This
echos similar results in the massive scalar case of ref. [17], In many cases we were able to
verify our tree-level results not only with Feynman rules for the entire amplitude but also by
considering the kinematic weights of the same graphs contributing to supersymmetric theories
(and thus having fermions dressed in the adjoint). We expect this universality of kinematic
color-dual weights to be an important future thread to explore. One should be cautious
5Admittedly by far the most efficient approach to one-loop calculation.
6Despite similar statements being recognized for gauge invariant ordered kinematic amplitudes [36], or
indeed the universality of off-shell kinematic components of Feynman rules, the key point here is the dressing
of graphs to satisfy algebraic properties can often mean adding zero to an amplitude by introducing contact
contributions that cancel between graphs. A priori one could imagine different functional forms for the dressing
of graphs that satisfy different algebraic properties.
– 46 –about such a universality at loop-level – given the explicit dimensional dependence of fermion
traces, and the fact that adjoint conditions can relate graphs with closed fermion loops to
graphs without. The latter relation does not occur for Dirac fermions in the fundamental,
but adjoint color-dual relations would relate n5of the one-loop four-fermion integrand to n3.
Ultimately we expect this to simply fix the dimension where adjoint fermionic theories can be
color-dual (the same dimensions that admit supersymmetry) in the manner of our example
at four-point tree-level in Section 4.3.
A feature of the fermionic developments of this paper is that it dovetails incredibly well
with a color-dual compositional approach [55–58] to building amplitudes associated with
higher-derivative operators in both gauge and gravity theories, of relevance both for effective
field theory searches for beyond the standard model physics, and formal ultraviolet completion
in gravity theories, which we look forward to exploring in forthcoming work.
The relevance of these types of results in the double-copy to considering at least toy
examples of Kerr-Schild black-hole interactions in the classical limit does not escape us –
encoding both massive spin-1/2 scattering when double-copied with the results of [17] as well
as massive spin-1 scattering when double-copied with itself. Furthermore the five-point one-
loop calculation with massive fermions and emitted gluon is well within reach and will allow
for a description of the one-loop correction gravitational radiative processes involving spinning
matter which is a natural target as is of course higher-loops with associated corresponding
progress in the κ, or Post-Minkowskian, expansion for higher-spin. Data already exists at
one-loop in the conservative sector for fixed order results at arbitrarily oriented spin at four-
points from direct cut-construction of one-loop amplitudes [50] applying double-copy only at
tree-level. An intriguing open question is if composition can be used to efficiently go after all
order-spin scattering at loop level using color-dual massive loop-graph numerators, such as
we present here, as building-blocks.

A External glue with a massive scalar loop
This case is very similar to the fermionic example of Section 6.2.1. Here we simply allow
a massive scalar to run in the loop instead of the quark, but otherwise we have the same
topologies and color-dual relations between their kinematic weights, Fig. 15.

graphs contribute to two-to-two scattering for graphs 2,3, 5, and 6 hold with flavors swapped.
Taking the numerators as functional allows us to dress those graphs via relabeling.
In our unitarity cut, we sew two four-point tree-level amplitudes. Each tree amplitude is
between two scalars and two gluons. Using a bootstrap imposing the duality between color
and kinematics and the consistency of factorization, one can find find numerators and then
ordered amplitudes [17]. For example, the numerator for Fig. 16:

Now, we are equipped to do the two particle cut in the scalar case, Fig. 17. Repeating
the same procedures as for the fermionic loop, we can find ordered amplitudes which are
gauge-independent. For example, like the fermionic case, for all plus gluons, all coefficients
of basis integrals will vanish except the box integral. As expressed in Eqn. 6.28, we find half
the result of the fermionic case, matching the well known result [3].
