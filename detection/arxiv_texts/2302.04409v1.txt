Abstract:  The graphene -like two -dimensional (2D) silicon carbide  or siligraphene  has attracted 
remarkable attentions, owing to its fascinating physical  properties . Nevertheless, the first high-
quality  siligraphene , i.e., monolayer Si 9C15 was synthesised very recently, which exhibits an 
excellent semiconducting behaviour . In this work, we investigate  the mechanical properties of 
Si9C15 siligraphene  by using atomistic simulations including density functional theory  (DFT)  
calculations  and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Both methods confirm  the existence of 
intrinsic negative Poisson’s ratio s in Si9C15 siligraphene , which, as illustrated by MD simulations, 
is attributed to the tension -induced  de-wrinkling behaviour s of its intrinsic rippled configuration . 
Different de-wrinkling  behaviours are observed in different directions  of Si9C15 siligraphene , 
which result in the anisotropy  of its auxetic  property . The fracture property of Si9C15 siligraphene  
is similarly anisotrop ic, but relatively large fracture strains are observed in different orientations , 
indicating the stretchability of Si9C15 siligraphene . The stretchability  together with the strain -
sensitive bandgap of Si9C15 siligraphene  observed in DFT calculations indicates the effectiveness  
of strain engineering in modulating its electronic propert y. The combination of unique auxetic 
property , excellent mechanical propert y and tunable electronic propert y may render Si9C15 
siligraphene  a novel 2D material  with multifunctional applications.

The successful mechanical exfoliation  of monolayer graphene flakes from  graphite in 2004 
[1] has prompted  the incredible  research  interests  in two -dimensional (2D) materials. Since then, 
many new 2D materials such as transition metal -dichalcogenide [ 2], silicene [ 3], hexagonal 
boron nitride (hBN) [4], and black phosphorus [ 5] have been synthesized  by the aforementioned 
mechanical exfoliation method and some other synthesis method s such as  electrochemical 
intercalation, ball milling, el ectrochemical intercalation, chemical vapor deposition, physical 
vapor deposition, to name a few  [6, 7] . Compared to their bulk counterparts, 2D materials 
possess many superior material properties, such as  significant quantum effects [ 8], extremely 
high surface area -to-volume ratio [ 9], extra -large electrical and thermal conductivities [ 10, 11], 
and extraordinary mechanical strength [ 12]. Inspired by  the remarkable properties discovered in 
2D materials  as well as the development of synthesis technique at the nanoscale , many efforts  
recently have been made  to explore the possible existence of  some other 2D materials  [13, 14 ]. 
As a semiconductor with the widest range of energy bandgap, silicon carbide (SiC) has 
attracted extensive research interest s. Specifically, the wide -bandgap semiconducting property 
together with the high thermal capability of SiC makes it become a key material in various 
technological applications including high -power electronics, photonic devices, high -temperature 
devices and quantum information processing [ 15-17]. Inspired by the unique property, especially 
outstanding semiconducting propert ies, the exploration of 2D form of SiC is currently receiving 
the most attention from the community  of 2D materials . It is expected that 2 D SiC can not only 
retain the overall SiC properties but also exhibit unique  optical and electronic properties due to 
the reduced dimensionality and quantum confinement [ 18, 19 ]. As a binary compound of carbon 
and silicon, 2D SiC can exist in a variety of compositions and hence structures i.e., Si xCy, which 
include the siligraphene possessing  the similar  honeycomb lattice of graphene and the non-3 siligraphene crystals  with structures beyond the hexagonal lattice . To date, many 2D SiC  
materials have been theoretically predicted to be  structurally  stable . For example, C-rich 
siligraphene (SiC 2, SiC 3, SiC 5 and SiC 7) [20-27] and Si-rich siligraphene (Si 3C, Si 5C and Si 7C) 
have been proposed by high -throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations  [24-27]. 
Recently, DFT calculations were also employed to seek the non-siligraphene crystals such as 
penta -SiC 2, SiC 6, -SiC 7, SiC 8, to name a few  [28-32]. Meanwhile, many theoretical efforts also 
have been made to reveal  the material properties of 2D SiC  materials . Through atomistic 
simulations including DFT calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, many 
superior properties and thus novel potential applications of 2D SiC have been observed [ 29, 33 -
36]. Although  a great progress has been made in theoretically predicting structure s of 2D SiC 
materials, few of these predicted 2D SiC materials have been  synthesized  in the laboratory due to 
the lack of the corresponding experimental synthetic routes . Very rec ently, Gao et al. [37] made 
a big progress in the synthesis  of 2D SiC  by successfully fabricating the high-quality Si 9C15 
siligraphene with the large -scale atomic monolayer . The possible exfoliation of freestanding 
monolayer  Si9C15 from metal substrates  together with its good air stability  and semiconducting 
behaviour make s Si9C15 siligraphene appealing for applications in 2D electronics and photonics. 
In these applications, the monolayer Si 9C15 is required to retain its structural integrity under the 
possible external stimuli. Besides, because the strain engineering is usually an efficient method 
to modify physical properties of 2D materials [ 38-41], the mechanics of Si 9C15 siligraphene is 
also importan t for proper functioning of Si 9C15 siligraphene -based devices . Thus , to promote the 
future  applications of newly synthesized  Si9C15 siligraphene , it becomes necessary to achieve a 
comprehensive understanding of its mechanical properties . 4 In this paper,  the mechanical properties  of Si9C15 siligraphene  are comprehensively 
investigated by DFT calculations and MD simulations. The mechanical and thermodynamic 
stabilit ies of freestanding Si9C15 siligraphene  are also verified by the Born stability criteria and  
ab initio  molecular dynamics  (AIMD) simulations , respectively . Both DFT calculations and MD 
simulations illustrate  a stable rippled configuration  intrinsically existing in Si9C15 siligraphene , 
the de-wrinkling  of which under uniaxial tension results in its auxetic  behaviours. The auxetic  
behaviours as well as the fracture behaviours of Si9C15 siligraphene  are found to be dependent on 
the loading direction. Finally, the temperature effect on auxetic  and fracture  properties of Si9C15 
siligraphene  is also examined.  
 
2. Computational methodology  
2.1 DFT calculations  
DFT calculations were conducted to majorly examine the fundamental elastic properties and 
the thermodynamic stability  of freestanding monolayer Si 9C15. Here, all DFT calculations were 
conducted through the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [ 42] with the plane -wave 
cutoff energy in the Perdew -Burke -Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) 
[43] being set as 400 eV for the exchange correlation potential. The convergence criterion  for the 
electronic self consistence -loop was set as 10−5 eV, while the force threshold of structural 
optimization was set as 10−2 eV/Å. The k -point mesh with a density of 0.25/Å was sampled in 
the in -plane B rillouin zone of the unit cell. Periodic boundary conditions were applied along all 
three directions to exclude the boundary effect. Moreover, a vacuum layer of 2 5 Å was added in 
the thickness direction to avoid image -image interactions. After obtaining th e energy minimized 
structures of monolayer Si 9C15, its electronic properties were evaluated by using a k -point grid of 5 21 ×  21 ×  1. In addition, AIMD simulations at the temperature of 500 K were also performed to 
verify the thermodynamic stability of monolayer Si 9C15 by reducing the k -point grid into 2 ×  2 ×  
1. Here, the optimized structures of monolayer Si 9C15 were simulated within the NVT  (constant 
number of particles, volume and temperature)  ensemble using Andersen thermostat at 500 K and 
a time ste p of 1 fs.  
 
2.2 MD simulations  
MD simulations were conducted to study the mechanical properties especially the fracture 
properties of Si 9C15 siligraphene , since  dynamics factors such as the temperature effect  can be 
considered in MD. Moreover, MD simulations have the capability  to study a Si9C15 siligraphene  
with larger number of atoms. Here, a Si9C15 siligraphene  sample with the size of 10 nm ×  10 nm 
was considered in MD simulations. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in both in -plane 
directions, while a vacuum spacing of 5 nm was placed in the thickness direction. All MD 
simulations were conducted with the aid of open -source code LAMMPS [ 44] with the optimized  
Tersoff potential  [45], which  has been successfully employed in the previous MD simulations to 
describe 2D SiC materials [ 35, 36 ]. The velocity Verlet algorithm with a time step of 0.5 fs was 
employed to integrate equations of motion. Before conducting the mechanical study,  conjugate 
gradient methods were used to obtain the equilibrium states of Si9C15 siligraphene considered 
here. In doing this,  NPT (constant number of particles, pressure and temperature)  simulations  
were conducted  for 50 ps, in which the Nosé -Hoover thermostat and barostat were employed at a 
certain  temperature and zero pressure. The mechanical behaviours of Si9C15 siligraphene  were 
studied by gradually elongating the simulation box along one in -plane direction with a relatively 
low strain rat e of 0.0005/ps . The strain rate  selected here can be used to equivalently simulate the 6 quasi -static loading. During the elongation process, the strain was taken as the relative change of 
the length of siligraphene , while the stress was calculated as the arithmetic mean of local stresses 
on all atoms  [46]. 
 
3. Results and discussion  
3.1 Mechanical properties at the ground state  from DFT  
As shown in Fig. 1a, Si 9C15 siligraphene  generally has a honeycomb lattice similar to that of 
graphene. Thus, there exist two  principle directions  in Si9C15 siligraphene , i.e., armchair (AC) 
and zigzag (ZZ) directions. In Si9C15 siligraphene , each C -C hexagon is surrounded by twelve Si -
C hexagons . Because C -C and Si -C bonds have very different bond properties such as different 
bond lengths, the freestanding Si9C15 siligraphene  is found to exhibit a rippled configuration with 
an amplitude  around 1 Å after the structural optimization  as show n in Fig. 1b . This intrinsic 
nonplanar configuration of Si9C15 siligraphene is totally in contrast to the planar structure of 
most other 2D materials, such as graphene, black phosphorus and hBN . To provide useful 
insights into the atomic bonding nature of Si9C15 siligraphene, we show in Fig. 1 c its electron 
localization function (ELF), which is a spatial function having the ability to quantitatively  
distinguish different types of chemical bonds. The value of ELF ranges between  0 and 1. 
Specifically, an ELF close to 1 indicates strong covalent interaction s or lone pair electrons, while 
a lower ELF corresponds to metallic or ionic bonds. As shown in Fig. 1 c, values of ELF around 
the centre of each bond are more than 0.8, which indicates that atoms in Si 9C15 siligraphene are 
covalently bonded. Moreover, the electron localization around the centre of Si-C bonds is 
broader than that of their C -C counterparts,  which indicates the weaker stiffness of Si-C bonds. 
Thus, it is reasonable  to expect that  Si9C15 siligraphene  should possess a weaker stiffness 7 compared to graphene, which will be verified later in th e following DFT and MD studies. Fig. 1 d 
shows that the energy of Si 9C15 siligraphene reaches equilibrium rapidly at the beginning of 
AIMD simulations and  remains almost unchanged afterwards. At the end of AIMD simulations , 
no bond breakages or disorders are found in the structure. In other words, no topological change 
is observed in Si9C15 siligraphene during the entire AIMD simulation process, in spite of  a larger 
out-of-plane deformation observed  due to the thermal fluctuation  at a finite temperature.  These 
results indicate the thermodynamic stability of the freestanding Si 9C15 siligraphene.  
Based on the finite distortion method  in DFT calculations , the l inear elastic constants of 
Si9C15 siligraphene were calculated  after assuming  the thickness of Si 9C15 siligraphene as 3.5 Å 
[34, 35]. As for a 2D material, there are four independent elastic constants, i.e., C11, C22, C12 and 
C66 in Si 9C15 siligraphene . Values of these elastic constants obtained from DFT calculations are 
listed in the Supplementary Material. These elastic constants satisfy the Born criteria of 
      -       and C11, C22, C66>0 [47], which further indicates the mechanical stability of Si 9C15 
siligraphene.  Furthermore, these elastic constants  can be utilized to  evaluate the depend ence of  
Young’s modulus E, shear modulus G and Poisson’s ratio  on the orientation  of Si9C15 
siligraphene by using the following equations  [48]: 
 4 4 2 2

,                                        
where a = cos() and b = sin(). In Eq. 1, S11, S22, S12 and S66 are compliance constants related to 
the elastic constants [ 48]. 8 Almost isotropic Young’s modulus E and shear modulus G are found in the intrinsically 
nonplanar Si 9C15 siligraphene  (see Fig. 2a and 2b) . For example, when the orientation  shifts 
from 0o (the ZZ direction) to 45o, E decreases from 272 GPa to 260 GPa. In th is process,  G is 
found to increase from 141 GPa to 150 GPa. As  changes to 90o (the AC direction), E slightly 
grows to 261 GPa, while G declines to 141 GPa. In other words, E and G in all orientations of 
Si9C15 siligraphenes fluctuate around mean values of 266 GPa and 146 GPa, respectively. The 
deviation of the average value of E from the maximum or minimum E is less than 2%, while this 
deviation is less than 4% for G. The intrinsic  E and G of the present Si 9C15 siligraphene are 
found to be smaller than values of graphene and hBN but larger than values of most transition 
metal -dichalcogenide [ 49]. A negative Poisson’s ratio is found in Si 9C15 siligraphene  (see Fig. 
2c), which means that the monolayer Si 9C15 intrinsically exhibits an auxetic behaviour due to its 
unique nonplanar configuration. The mechanism of the auxetic behaviour will be discussed latter. 
Moreover,  in contrast to the isotropy observed in  its Young’s modulus and shear modulus , the 
Poisson’s ratio  of Si9C15 siligraphenes is significantly anisotropic , since  a nonmonotonic change 
is observed in  of Si 9C15 siligraphenes when  changes from 0o to 90o. For instance,   is found 
to grow from its maximum value of -0.11 to its minimum  value of -0.08 when  changes from 0o 
to 45o. When  varies from 45o to 90o,  increase s to -0.11. In general, the ratio of the maximum 
Poisson’s ratio  to its minimum counterpart can be up to 1.38. 
Monolayer Si 9C15 was reported to possess a moderate bandgap [ 37]. To further broaden the 
application fields of Si 9C15 siligraphene in 2D optoelectronic devices, some methods are desired 
to be developed for modulating its electronic properties. Strain engineering is one of the most 
common means to modify electronic structures of 2D materials [ 38-41]. Thus, we also studied 
the strain effect on the electronic band structures of Si9C15 siligraphene . It is shown in Fig. 3a  9 that Si9C15 siligraphene  without loading possess es a direct bandgap of 2.07 eV, which is close to 
the value of 1.9 eV reported in the previous study  [37]. When the size of Si9C15 siligraphene  is 
elongated by 5% or a tensile strain of 5%  is appli ed, the bandgap reduces to 1.55 eV as shown in 
Fig. 3b . The significant reduction observed in  the bandgap of the stretched Si9C15 siligraphene  is 
ascribed to the splitting of both valence band maximum and conduction band maximum near the 
Γ point, though the key features such as the direct band gap of band structures now remain 
almost unchanged.  As the tensile strain increases to 10%, the direct bandgap shifts to an indirect 
bandgap as shown in Fig. 3c, which is accompanied with a reduction of the bandgap of Si 9C15 
siligraphene  further to 1.48 eV.  
 
3.2 Mechanical properties at the finite temperature from MD  
The mechanical properties of Si 9C15 siligraphene were also investigated by MD simulations, 
since the MD method has the capability  to consider a Si 9C15 siligraphene sample with a larger 
number of atoms. Moreover, in MD simulations, dynamic factors such as the temperature effect  
can be taken into account in the study of tensile test, which is out of the reach of the above DFT 
calculat ions.  
In Fig. 4a, we show the relationship between the stress   and strain  of Si9C15 siligraphene 
stretched in the x or ZZ direction. Here, the temperature is  10 K. It is found that the stress in 
Si9C15 siligraphene monotonously grows as the strain increases before its fracture. Moreover, 
some changes in the slope s of stress -strain curves are observed in this process, which indicate the 
possible  structur al change s of Si 9C15 siligraphene during the stretching process. To prove this 
deduction, we also show in Fig. 4a the relationship between  the strains in th e loading and the 
corresponding perpendicular directions, i.e., x and y, respectively . It is found that when the 10 tensile strain x is smaller than 12%, y with a positive magnitude increases as x grows, which 
indicates the existence of a negative Poisson’s ratio in Si 9C15 siligraphene during this initial 
tension process. This phenomenon is consistent with the intrinsic auxetic behaviour  observed in  
above DFT calculations . To explain the intrinsic auxetic behaviour  in Si9C15 siligraphene , we 
show some representative snapshots for the configuration of Si 9C15 siligraphene during the 
tension process in Fig. 5a. It is found that the rippling amplitude of Si 9C15 siligraphene decreases 
markedly as the tensile strain increases, which can result in the expansion of the structure in the 
perpendicular direction as shown in Fig. 5b. In other words , the de -wrinkling behaviour leads to 
the negative Poisson’s ratio in intrinsically rippled Si 9C15 siligraphene . The similar de -wrinkling 
mechanism was previously used to design the  auxetic property of  graphene by artificially 
introducing the topological defects and oxidation [ 50, 51 ]. When the tensile strain x increases 
beyond 12%, y shown in Fig. 4a is found to inversely decrease as x grows,  which indicates that 
the Poisson’s ratio of Si9C15 siligraphene becomes positive now. The occurrence of the positive 
Poisson’s ratio demonstrates  the disappearance of  de-wrinkling effect in the nearly flat Si9C15 
siligraphene  now. 
After the tensile loading shift s from the x (or ZZ) direction to the y (or AC) direction, 
although a similar stress -strain relation retain s in Si9C15 siligraphene , a different relationship 
between the strains in the loading direction ( y) and the corresponding perpendicular direction ( x) 
is observed . As shown in Fig. 4b, when y is smaller than 3.3% , x grows as  y increases due to 
the similar de -wrinkling effect in  the intrinsically rippled Si 9C15 siligraphene . When y reaches 
3.3% , an abrupt  drop is observed in x, which is induced by a sudden configuration transition 
from the irregularly rippled shape to a regularly wrinkled shape as shown in Fig. 6. The end of 
the configuration transition process is observed at the strain of 7.2% . After that , x increases 11 again as y grows  similarly due to the de -wrinkling of the regularly wrinkled Si 9C15 siligraphene . 
When y becomes larger than 19%, x turns to decrease with growing y, indicating the flattening 
of the stretched Si 9C15 siligraphene as shown in Fig. 6. 
From the above discussion, it is found that the deformation of Si 9C15 siligraphene  stretched 
along the x (or ZZ) direction consists of two processes that successively are  nonplanar and planar 
deformations . These two processes  are noted  here as process I and II, respectively . As for the 
siligraphene  stretched along the y (or AC) direction, there exist three processes including the 
initial nonplanar deformation within the irregularly rippled shape, the successive nonplanar 
deformation within the regularly wrinkled shape, and final planar deformation , which are noted 
as process I, II , and III, respectively . The Young’s modulus E and the Poiss on’s ratio  at these 
different processes of Si 9C15 siligraphene are listed  in Tab. 1. Here, the Young’s modulus E was 
calculated as the slope of - curve  at the begin ning of each process , while the Poisson’s ratio  
was represented as the slope of x-y (or y-x) curve. The Young’s moduli at process I of ZZ and 
AC directions are around  68 GPa and  47 GPa, respectively. The similarity of Young’s moduli 
in these two  directions is consistent with the almost isotropy of the intrinsic Young’s modulus 
observed in above DFT calculations. However, the magnitude of the Young’s modulus obtained 
from MD simulations is generally larger than the result extracted from DFT calcul ations. This 
quantitative difference is probably attributed to the different configurations of their intrinsic 
ripples. Because a larger model and the temperature effect can be considered in MD simulation s, 
Si9C15 siligraphene  in MD simulations  intrinsical ly exhibit s an irregularly rippled shape (see Figs. 
5a and 6), while a regularly rippled shape of Si9C15 siligraphene is observed in DFT calculations 
(see Fig. 1b). This difference also results in the different Poisson’s ratios obtained from these 
two methods, though both methods predict that Si 9C15 siligraphene intrinsically ha s a negative 12 Poisson’s ratio. Specifically, t he Poisson’s ratio at process I of ZZ direction is -0.38, which is 
about three times larger than the value ( -0.12) of AC direction. When the Si9C15 siligraphene 
stretched in the y (or AC) direction enters process II, its Young’s modulus increases to 47  GPa, 
since the deformation in the loading direction of the regularly wrinkled structure shown in Fig. 6 
now is majorly due to the elongation or rotation of strong C -C or Si -C bonds rather than the 
weak de-wrinkling effect. Meanwhile, the magnitude of the negative Poisson’s ratio in this 
process can grow to -1.15, indicat ing that the de -wrinkling effect now has a more significant 
effect o n the deformation perpendicular to the loading direction. In the final planar deformation 
process, Young’s moduli of ZZ and AC directions of Si 9C15 siligraphene are , respectively,  487 
GPa and 385 GPa, while Poisson’s ratios of these two directions are 0.119 and 0.048, 
respectively. This anisotropic mechanical property observed in MD simulations is in contrast to 
the isotropic mechanical property observed in DFT calculations of planar Si 9C15 siligraphene 
(see Fig. 2). The anis otropy of mechanical property is ascribed to the very different states of 
stress of the planar Si9C15 siligraphene stretched in two different directions. Moreover, due to the 
finite strain effect, the Young’s modulus and  Poisson’s ratio extracted from MD s imulations both 
are smaller than the results predicted from DFT calculations. From the above discussion, we can 
come to the conclusion that the mechanical properties of Si 9C15 siligraphene can be affected by 
the finite size, temperature and strain  effects , all of which can be considered in MD simulations 
but are out of the reach of DFT calculations.  
We also  examined the mechanical responses of Si 9C15 siligraphene stretched at different 
temperatures ranging from 10 K  to 500 K . As shown in Fig. 7 , - and x-y (or y-x) relation s of 
all Si 9C15 siligraphene structures  are similar to each other , in spite of some differences found in 
their curve slope s, indicat ing change s in corresponding mechanical properties (Young’s modulus 13 and/or the Poisson’s ratio ) of Si 9C15 siligraphene . As an example, in Fig. 8a and 8b we show 
Young’s moduli  and Poisson’s ratios of intrinsically rippled Si 9C15 siligraphene. Indeed,  when 
the temperature increases from    K to 5   K, Young’s moduli in ZZ and AC directions, 
respectively, de crease from 268 GPa to 252 GPa and from 247 GPa to 162 GPa. The reduction in 
the Young’s modulus with growing temperate is due to the so -called thermally induced softening 
effect widely observed in many other 2D materials  [40, 52, 53] , which is found to be more 
significant in the AC direction. The Poisson’s ratio , however, is found to be almost independent 
of the temperature. For instance, Poisson’s ratios of ZZ and AC directions rise and fall around 
mean values of -0.35 and -0.11, respectively. The d eviations of the average values of ZZ and AC 
directions from their maximum or minimum values are less than 11% and 12%, respectively.  
We also see from Figs. 4 and 7 that, the stress  of all Si 9C15 siligraphene  structures  suddenly 
drops to zero  after the strain reach es the threshold value, i.e. , the fracture strain. The threshold 
value of the stress at the fracture strain is termed as the tensile strength.  The sudden drop of the 
stress from the tensile strength  to zero ref lects the physical process from the nucleation of the 
initial void to the final rupture  induced by the breaking of Si -C bonds  (see the Supplementary 
Material) , since, as shown above,  the stiffness of Si-C bonds is weaker than that of their C -C 
counterparts . No significant increment of strain in th is process indicates a brittle fracture of 
Si9C15 siligraphene,  irrespective of the temperature or loading direction. As shown in Fig. 8c and 
8d, the tensile strength and fracture strain in both ZZ and AC directions similarly decrease as the 
temperature grows, since the Si -C bonds in Si 9C15 siligraphene exhibit a more significant thermal 
fluctuation at a higher temperature. Once some Si -C bonds are broken due the serious thermal 
fluctuation at a high tempe rature, some voids are initiated, which is immediately followed by the 
catastrophic failure or the brittle facture of whole Si 9C15 siligraphene. In terms of the temperature 14 effect on fracture properties in different  directions, the tensile strength and fra cture strain in the 
ZZ direction are more sensitive to the temperature change. For instance , when the temperature is 
as low as 10 K, the tensile strength in the ZZ direction is 168 GPa, which is about 24% larger 
than the value of  136 GPa in the AC direction. However, due to its more sensitivity to the 
temperature change, the tensile strength in the ZZ direction decreases to 99 GPa at 400 K, which 
is comparable to the value  of 97 GPa in the AC direction at the same temperature. Similarly, 
although a t the temperature of 10 K the fracture strain in the ZZ direction is similarly  about 24% 
larger than the value  of the AC direction, fracture strains in these two direction s become  close to 
each other at the temperature of 4 00 K. As the temperature keeps growing to 500 K, both tensile 
strength and fracture strain of the AC direction inversely  turn to be much larger than their 
counterpart s of the ZZ direction.  Moreover, the facture strain is comparable to the value of other 
stretchab le 2D materials such as graphene, h -BN and MoS 2 [40].  
 
4. Conclusions  
The mechanical properties of recently synthesized Si 9C15 siligraphene  are investigated in 
this work based on atomistic simulations including DFT calculations and MD simulations. Both 
methods prove  the existence of the intrinsic negative Poisson’s ratio in Si 9C15 siligraphene, in 
spite of the difference observed in  magnitude s of the negative Poisson’s ratio s predicted from 
these two methods. This quantitative deviation is ascribed to the different  rippl ing configurations 
of Si 9C15 siligraphenes  predicted from two methods, since MD simulations have the capability to 
consider the realistic finite size and temperature effects, which are, however, out of the reach of 
DFT calculations. The de -wrinkling of intrinsic rippled configuration s of Si 9C15 siligraphene 
under uniaxial tension induces  the auxetic behaviour or the negative Poisson’s ratio  of Si9C15 15 siligraphene . Moreover, different de-wrinkling  behaviours  are observed in Si9C15 siligraphene  
stretched along different directions. A continuous de-wrinkling  process of irregular ripple s is 
observed in Si9C15 siligraphene  stretched along the ZZ direction, while a transition from the 
irregularly rippled shape to the regularly wrinkled shape  is observed in the de-wrinkling  process 
of Si9C15 siligraphene  stretched along the AC direction. The configuration transition  can greatly 
enhance the de-wrinkling  effect and thus  increase  the magnitude of the negative Poisson’s ratio  
in the AC direction . In addition,  Si9C15 siligraphene  structure s stretch ed in ZZ and AC directions 
also have  different fracture properties, but both of them similarly possess relatively large fracture 
strains . The stretchability  of Si9C15 siligraphene  together with its strain -sensitive bandgap 
observed in DFT calculations indicates the feasibility  of strain engineering in modulating the 
electronic properties  of Si9C15 siligraphene . With t he combination of unique auxetic property , 
excellent mechanical propert y and tunable electronic propert y, Si9C15 siligraphene  may have  new 
potential applications of in nanodevices and nanomaterials.
