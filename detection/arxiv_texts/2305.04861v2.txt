Abstract
In this paper, we present double dimensional reduction of th e complete M5-brane action in the Sen
formalism of self-dual form. Although in this formalism the gravity couples tothe independentpseudo-
2-form and pseudo- 3-form ﬁelds in a non-standard and very complicated way, the d ouble dimensional
reduction on the complete action can be carried out. This is b y dualising some components of the
pseudo-2-form ﬁeld and integrating out the pseudo- 3-form ﬁeld. We show explicitly that the double
dimensional reduction on a circle gives rise to the complete D4-brane or the complete dual D4-brane
action dependingon whatcomponents ofthepseudo- 2-form ﬁeldare dualised. Thedualitybetweenthe
D4-braneanddual D4-brane actions are realised inthe viewp oint of theSenformalism as theswapping
of the roles of the components of the pseudo- 2-form ﬁeld between those which are dualised and those
which remain. We also make a brief outline on how to generalis e this to the cases of dimensional
reduction on some other spaces as well as how to understand th e duality of reduced action from
the viewpoint of the Sen formalism. An explicit example for d imensional reduction of the quadratic
six-dimensional action on a torus is given and the realisati on of its S-duality is also discussed.
1 Introduction
The constructions of the low-energy eﬀecitive
action describing an M5-brane coupled to the
background eleven-dimensional supergravity have
been known to be non-trivial. This is largely
due to the diﬃculty in the construction of a
six-dimensional action for a chiral 2-form ﬁeld,
which is one of the ﬁelds in the ﬁeld content of
the M5-brane. The self-duality of its 3-form ﬁeld
strengthHmakes the straightforward attempt
impossible, since H∧ ∗H= 0 when impos-
ingH=∗Hin six dimensions. Therefore, the
idea is to ﬁrst work out the six-dimensional
action for a chiral 2-form ﬁeld then generalise tothe complete M5-brane action coupled to back-
ground eleven-dimensional supergravity. Various
non-trivial approaches which allow this are for
example by giving up manifest diﬀeomorphism
invariance [ 1], [2], [3], [4], [5], or by introducing
auxiliary ﬁelds which have no dynamics as in the
PST formalism [ 6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].
Oncetheactionofthechiralﬁeldis constructed,it
is usually relatively simpler to extend to the com-
plete M5-brane action. It is also worth mentioning
a recent approach [ 14], [15], [16] in which further
auxiliaryﬁelds areintroduced tolift the limitation
on the auxiliary ﬁeld in the chiral 2-form action in
the PST formalism.
1Another recent approach is given in [ 17], [18]
which is motivated by string ﬁeld theory. This
approach, which is called the Sen formalism, in
fact applies to self-dual ﬁelds in 4 p+ 2 dimen-
sions. The case relevant to us is therefore p= 1.In
this case, the Sen formalism gives a new perspec-
tive on the 2-form ﬁeld with linear self-dual ﬁeld
strengththatthe2-formﬁeldisinfactnotaninde-
pendent ﬁeld. In this approach, the independent
ﬁelds are a 2-form ﬁeld Pand a 3-form ﬁeld Q.
Bothofthese ﬁeldsarenon-standard,forexample,
theytransforminanunusualwayunderdiﬀeomor-
phism transformation. Furthermore, the ﬁeld Qis
linearself-dualwithrespecttoﬂatsix-dimensional
metric even if the six-dimensional spacetime is
curved. It is also required that a certain combi-
nation ofQand the curved metric gives rise to
a 3-form ﬁeld Hwhich is oﬀ-shell self-dual with
respect to the curvedmetric and is closed on-shell.
So in the spacetime with trivial topology, His
exact on-shell. Therefore, in the Sen formalism,
instead of describing the 2-form ﬁeld with linear
self-dual ﬁeld strength, one describes an exact lin-
ear self-dual 3-form ﬁeld which is in fact not an
independent ﬁeld.
Studies of various aspects as well as exten-
sions of the Sen formalism are given for example
in [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Of particular
interest to us is the extension [ 23] to a com-
plete M5-brane action coupled to background
eleven-dimensionalsupergravity.Theconstruction
is within the Green-Schwarz formalism in which
only the target space has manifest supersymme-
try. The constructed action has all the required
symmetries for example gauge symmetries, diﬀeo-
morphism, and κ-symmetry.
Although the M5-brane action in the Sen for-
malism has been constructed, further studies are
still required in order to better understand the
action. One of the important aspects is that the
independent ﬁelds PandQare expected to cou-
ple to gravity in a non-standard and complicated
way since these ﬁelds transform in an unusual way
underdiﬀeomorphismandtheactionisnon-linear.
In order to work towards this goal, one may study
dimensional reduction.
It turns out that even the dimensional reduc-
tion of the originalquadraticaction in Sen formal-
ism is readily a challenge. Although it is possible
to carry out dimensional reduction on variousspaces, the studies [ 18], [19] are mostly being
restricted to the cases in which the uncompact
space is ﬂat. So when extending to the M5-brane
action, the situation is expected to be even more
complicated. Nevertheless, this is exactly the task
we focus on in this work.
The aim of this paper is to present double
dimensional reduction of the complete M5-brane
action in Sen formalism. In particular, we are
going to show explicitly that double dimensional
reduction on a circle gives rise to the complete
D4-brane action or the complete dual D4-brane
action, depending on the processes. It turns out
that these two processes are related simply by
swapping the components of the psuedo-form P.
In fact, the swapping is shown to be related to
a duality transformation. We also outline how
to generalise this to some other spaces provided
that the six-dimensional worldvolume is a Carte-
sian product and that a chosen set of projection
operators on 3-form ﬁelds satisfy several simple
properties.
This paper is organised as follows. In section
2, we review the M5-brane action in the Sen
formalism. This action is a complete action of
M5-brane in the eleven-dimensional supergravity
background. Basic properties of this action are
reviewed. In particular, we give a brief explana-
tion on how the coupling of this action to gravity
is complicated. In section 3, we present double
dimensional reduction of the M5-brane action in
the Sen formalism on a circle. We ﬁrst review and
slightly modify the approachof[ 20] for the dimen-
sional reduction of the Sen quadratic action on a
circle.Byafurther modiﬁcation,the approachcan
be applied to the M5-brane action in the Sen for-
malism whose induced metric is in a general form.
The approach involves integrating out some com-
ponentsofthe pseudo-form P,while theremaining
components are combined with some other ﬁelds,
through appropriate ﬁeld redeﬁnitions, to become
standard ﬁelds. Depending on the way that the
components are chosen, one arrives to either the
complete D4-braneor the complete dual D4-brane
actions each of which is coupled to type IIA
supergravitybackground.Thedualitybetweenthe
D4-brane and the dual D4-brane actions can be
realised from the viewpoint of the Sen formalism
as coming from swapping of the roles of the com-
ponents of P.With the insight gained from the
analysis, we proceed in section 4to generalise to
2thecasesofdimensionalreductiononotherspaces.
The generalisation looks promising as it gives the
reduced actionwhosephysicalpartdescribesstan-
dard ﬁelds. Dualities for reduced actions can also
be given from the viewpoint of the Sen formalism.
Further checks and generalisations could also be
possible which we leave as future works. We give
conclusions and discussions in section 5.
2 The M5-brane action with
self-dual 3-form
Inthissection,wereviewtheformoftheM5-brane
action in the Sen formalism [ 17], [18] which makes
use of non-standard self-dual 3-forms in the sense
that the self-duality is with respect to ﬂat met-
ric although the theory may couple to the curved
metric.
In the Sen formalism of self-dual (2 p+1)-form
in 4p+ 2 dimensional spacetime, there are two
kinds ofHodgestaroperators.The ﬁrstkind isthe
standard Hodge star operator ∗which is deﬁned
in the standard way, dependent on the space-
time metric. The second kind is denoted ∗′which
is similar to the standard Hodge star operator
but is deﬁned with respect to 4 p+2 dimensional
Minkowski metric.
From now on, let us focus on the case p=
1 which corresponds to self-dual 3-form in six
dimensional spacetime. In this case, the action
takes the form [ 17], [18], [19], [20]
S=/integraldisplay/parenleftbigg1
4dP∧∗′dP−Q∧dP+LI(Q,g,J)/parenrightbigg
,
(2.1)
wherePis a 2-form ﬁeld, Qis a 3-form ﬁeld,
gis the six dimensional metric, and Jis a 3-
form external source. Note that we have made the
rescaling of the ﬁelds with respect to those origi-
nally given in [ 17], [18] in order for the action to
have the standard scaling. This is closely related
to the scaling adopted in [ 19]. The ﬁeld Qis∗′-
self-dual, that is Q=∗′Q.The variation of the
action of LIwith respect to Qtakes the form
δQLI=δQ∧R(Q,g,J). (2.2)
Therefore,Ris∗′-anti-self-dual. Deﬁne
HJ≡Q−R+J, (2.3)which should be ∗-self-dual oﬀ-shell. That is, for
lineartheory, HJ=∗HJ.Theequationsofmotion
forPandQimply that
dH(s)= 0, dHJ=dJ, (2.4)
where
H(s)=Q+1
2(dP+∗′dP).(2.5)
The kinetic term of the ﬁeld Pin the action ( 2.1)
has the wrong sign. So the ﬁeld Pis unphysical.
However, this is not harmful as the combination
H(s)decouples from the physical ﬁeld HJ.From
eq.(2.4), it can be seen that in spacetime with
trivial topology, HJ−Jis exact on-shell.
It turns out that when promoting to non-
linear theory [ 23], the only change in the above
discussion is simply that the linear ∗-self-duality
becomes the non-linear ∗-self-duality condition
∗HJ=V(HJ,g). (2.6)
In particular, a complete M5-brane action in the
Green-Schwarz formalism in the form of eq.( 2.1)
reads [23]
SM5=1
2/integraldisplay/parenleftbigg1
2dP∧∗′dP−2Q∧dP−1

+Q∧R+2C6+F∧C3/parenrightbigg
,
(2.7)
which describes a six-dimensional worldvolume
embedded in the eleven-dimensional background
target superspace. For deﬁniteness, let us call the
action(2.7)asthe Sen M5-braneaction.Theﬁelds
g,C3,andC6are induced from the background
target superspace. In the context of the action
(2.1), the ﬁeld C3is identiﬁed as Jwhereas the
ﬁeldFis identiﬁed as HJ.That is
F=Q−R+C3. (2.8)
Note that we have rescaled the action eq.( 2.7)
with respect to that presented in [ 23]. This is in
order for the scaling to better match with other
M5-brane actions presented in the literature. The
scaling we made with respect to [ 23] isC6→
C6/2,SM5→SM5/2.The explicit form of Vin
eq.(2.6)inthecontextofM5-braneandtheformof
UM5in the action ( 2.7) can be described in index
3notation. So let us deﬁne the convention before
coming back to express VandU.
Let middle Greek alphabets for example µ,ν,ρ
represent indices of the coordinates of the six-
dimensional worldvolume. The worldvolume coor-
dinates are then labelled as dxµ.Deﬁned6x

whereǫµ1µ2···µ6is the Levi-Civita symbol deﬁned
such thatǫ012345= 1.The∗operator is deﬁned as

Similarly, the ∗′operator is deﬁned as

=dxµp+1∧···∧dxµ6(−1)p+1
(6−p)!×
ηµp+1νp+1···ηµ6ν6ǫνp+1···ν6µ1···µp.(2.11)
Diﬀerential p-forms are expressed in coordinates
as

given by

The action ( 2.7) possesses all the required
symmetries for example diﬀeomorphism, gauge
symmetries, and kappa-symmetry. It is interesting
to note that for each symmetry, transformation
rules forPandQare related by
δQ=−1
2(1+∗′)dδP, (2.17)
which implies that H(s)is invariant under all of
the symmetry transformations. This is desirable
sinceH(s)decouples from physical ﬁelds. Its sym-
metry transformations should be zero in order
to not aﬀect the symmetry transformations of
physical ﬁelds. Focusing on diﬀeomorphism, the
transformations on PandQunderxµ/ma√sto→xµ+ξµ
are
δξP=iξ(F−C3), δξQ=−1
2(1+∗)diξ(F−C3),
(2.18)
which are non-standard for 2-form and 3-form
ﬁelds. Due to this, the ﬁelds PandQare called
pseudo-forms.
Although the Sen M5-brane action ( 2.7) is
shown to be a complete M5-brane action, further
studies are still required in order to better under-
stand this action. Most notably, since PandQ
transform in a non-standard way under diﬀeomor-
phism, their coupling to gravity are non-standard
and is in fact complicated. This complication is
readily seen in the quadratic action,
S=/integraldisplay/parenleftbigg1

(2.19)
which for deﬁniteness, we will call this as the Sen
quadratic action. Here, Mis a linear operator on
3-form and is given by1
M= (1+∗∗′)−1(1−∗∗′). (2.20)
Part of non-standard coupling to gravity is due
to the operator ∗ ∗′.Its appearance through M
makes this non-standard coupling even more com-
plicated since Mcan in principle be expressed as
a power series in ∗∗′up to the 19th order. Indeed,
the complication is even further ampliﬁed in the

4Sen M5-brane action as it is non-linear in Q.It
is not even clear whether it can be given in the
closed form when expressed explicitly in Q.
One way to better understand how the Sen
M5-brane action is coupled to gravity is to study
dimensional reduction, which provides a simpler
scenario to study when compared with the Sen
M5-brane action itself.
In [18], [20], dimensional reductions of the Sen
quadratic action are carried out on various spaces.
Since the action couples to gravity in a compli-
cated way, in each case a special metric is chosen
such that the uncompactiﬁed space is ﬂat. This
makes it possible to carry out the analysis and
is suﬃcient for the purpose of extracting some
physics. It was remained to see whether the cases
of more general metric can be studied without
much diﬃculties.
Inthenextsection,wewillpresentthestudyof
the double dimensionalreduction on acircle ofthe
complete Sen M5-brane action which is coupled to
the background eleven-dimensional target super-
space. We will demonstrate how to successfully
study the full case in which the induced metric
takes a generalform dependent on the coordinates
of reduced worldvolume.
3 Double dimensional
reduction on a circle
3.1 Dimensional reduction of the
Sen quadratic action
Let us review the analysis of dimensional reduc-
tion of the Sen quadratic action ( 2.19) on a circle.
In [20], the analysis is given both in the Hamilto-
nian and Lagrangian formalisms. Let us however
only review the analysis of [ 20] in the Lagrangian
formalismandonlyfollowthekeyideas.Theexact
analysis will be carried out slightly diﬀerently
especially at the last stage. This results in the
interpretation being slightly improved.
Consider the case where the six-dimensional
spacetime has the metric of the form
g=/parenleftbiggη50
0r2/parenrightbigg
, (3.1)
whereη5is the ﬁve-dimensional ﬂat metric, and
ris a positive real number. The coordinate x5
has length dimension and is compactiﬁed as x5∼x5+l.Let every ﬁeld be independent from the
coordinate x5.
Let Roman alphabets for example
a,b,c,i,j,k,m,n represent indices of the coor-
dinates of the ﬁve-dimensional spacetime.
Denote
ǫijkmn≡ǫijkmn5, ǫijkmn≡ǫijkmn5.(3.2)
Therefore,ǫijkmnandǫijkmnare Levi-Civita sym-
bols on the ﬁve-dimensional spacetime.
Due to ∗′-self-duality of Qand∗′-anti-self-
duality of R,each of them has only ten inde-
pendent components. Let us denote indepedent
components for each of QandRas
qab≡Qab5, R ab≡Rab5.(3.3)
Therefore,
Qabc=1
2ǫabcijηimηjnqmn,
Rabc=−1
2ǫabcijηimηjnRmn.(3.4)
Let us express Rabin terms of qab.This can be
done by computing
R=MQ, (3.5)
which gives
Rab=−r−1
r+1qab. (3.6)
The action ( 2.19) then becomes

(3.7)
Next, let us make a replacement

on eq.(3.7) and introduce a Lagrange multiplier

(3.12)

r∈R+,the ﬁeldAahas the correct sign of the
kinetic term with the 1 /rscaling as required byconformal symmetry [ 25]. On the other hand, the
ﬁeldA(s)
ahas the wrong sign of the kinetic term.
Note that the diﬀerence between the analysis
in [20] and oursis just only in the ﬁeld redeﬁnition
which we have made in eq.( 3.13). The counter-
part presented in [ 20] leads to the conclusion that
the kinetic term of the standard Maxwell ﬁeld
scales with 1 /ronly in the limit r→0.On the
other hand, the ﬁeld redeﬁnition ( 3.13) leads to
the conclusion that the kinetic term of the stan-
dard Maxwell ﬁeld scales with 1 /rfor any value of
r∈R+,not only in the r→0 limit. The 1 /rscal-
ing upon dimensional reduction on a circle is also
in agreement with the result from the PST for-
malism. As a simple check, consider the quadratic
version of the M5-brane action in dual formula-
tion.Byconsideringthesix-dimensionalspacetime
with metric ( 3.1), identifying x5as a coordinate
on the circle, and keeping only the zero Fourier
mode, the action presented in eq.(3.19) of the ref-
erence [5] reduces to the ﬁve-dimensional Maxwell
theory with the scaling 1 /r.The exact agreement
with the requirement from conformal symmetry
and the relevant result from the PST formalism
further conﬁrms that the Sen quadratic action is
a quadratic action for an M5-brane.
In the next subsections, we will proceed to
extend the idea of this subsection to analyse dou-
ble dimensional reductions of the Sen M5-brane
action on a circle. It will be seen that although
the Sen M5-brane action couples to gravity in a
complicatedway,theanalysisbasedonslightmod-
iﬁcationsofthestepsgiveninthissubsectionturns
out to apply also for the Sen M5-brane action.
3.2 The complete D4-brane action
from the Sen M5-brane action
In the previous subsection, we have reviewed
the dimensional reduction of the Sen quadratic
action to give a ﬁve-dimensional Maxwell the-
ory. We worked with the case where the metric
is given by eq.( 3.1), in which the six-dimensional
worldvolume is a cartesian product of a ﬂat ﬁve-
dimensional spacetime with a circle with coordi-
natex5.
Itispossible,afterslightlymodifyingthestrat-
egy, to extend the analysis to the case of the Sen
M5-brane action which is a non-linear action with
source terms. In the previous subsection, we have
seen that the dimensional reduction is obtained
6by ﬁrst expressing Rin terms of Q,dualising
some components of P,then using Euler-Lagrange
equations to eliminate Q.Then after ﬁeld redeﬁ-
nition, we are left with the action which describes
an unphysical ﬁeld decoupled with Maxwell ﬁeld
in ﬁve dimensions.
In this section, since we are considering a
non-linear action with source terms, expressing R
directly in terms of Qwould be too complicated
if at all possible. As to be given in details below,
it turns out that the modiﬁcation of the strat-
egy is simply to switch some steps. This would
allow us to successfully dimensionally reduce the
Sen M5-brane action to the complete action which
describes a D4-brane in type IIA supergravity
background uncoupled with an unphysical ﬁeld.
Let usconsideradoubledimensionalreduction
of the Sen M5-brane action ( 2.7) by letting the
background target space be compactiﬁced such
thatX10is on a circle and let the x5coordinate
of M5-brane worldvolume wraps around X10.The
length ofx5is given by
/integraldisplay
dx5= 2πgsls. (3.15)
So if the tension TM5of the M5-brane action ( 2.7)
is introduced back, which is simply by making
a scalingSM5/ma√sto→TM5SM5, thenTM52πgsls=
TD4as expected. So from now on, let us set for
simplicity
/integraldisplay
dx5= 1, T M5= 1 =TD4.(3.16)
Under the double dimensional reduction, the
induced metric on the worldvolume is given by
gµν=/parenleftbigge−2φ/3γab+e4φ/3CaCbe4φ/3Ca
e4φ/3Cbe4φ/3/parenrightbigg
.
(3.17)
The ﬁeldsφandCaare considered as pullbacks
of the background superﬁeld to ﬁve-dimensional
worldvolume. Let us next consider how the pull-
backsC3andC6of the corresponding target
space superﬁelds are dimensionally reduced. The
components of C3are separated via
C3=1
2dxa∧dxb∧dx5Cba5+1
3!dxi∧dxj∧dxkCkij.
(3.18)It is natural to denote the following:
bab≡Cab5,˜Cab≡1
3!ǫabijkCijk.(3.19)
Note by deﬁnition that ˜Cabis the dualisation of
Cijkwith respect to ﬁve-dimensional ﬂat met-
ricη.So it would be convenient to deﬁne raising
and lowering of the indices of Band˜Cby using
ﬁve-dimensional ﬂat metric. As for C6,it can be
expressed as
C6=−C5∧dx5. (3.20)
So in summary, for the reduced theory, the pull-
backs of the target space superﬁelds of type IIA
supergravity to the ﬁve-dimensional worldvolume
theory areγab,b2,C1,C3,C5.
The worldvolume action then reads

(3.21)
Since, unlike the case discussed in the previous
subsection, the ﬁve-dimensional part of the world-
volume is not ﬂat. So one has to be more careful
when deﬁning trace as there are two kinds of met-
ric being used here to raise and lower indices. Let
us revisit the deﬁnition of trace. From now on, it
will be understood that components of matrices
appearing within the trace are of the form ( ·)ab.
For example,
[MN] =MabNba. (3.22)
For a given ﬁve-dimensional matrix M,we will
specify whether its components are raised by
ﬁve-dimensional ﬂat metric ηor ﬁve-dimensional
curved metric γ.The components of matrices

lowered by η.We will also later deﬁne other ﬁve-
dimensional matrices and will specify the metric
which are used to raise or lower their components.

theprevioussection,wewouldhavetoeliminate R
fromeq.( 3.21)byexpressingitintermsof Q,g,C 3.

The action ( 3.37) describes the complete D4-
brane [26] in type IIA supergravity background
decoupled with unphysical ﬁeld.
At this point, let us compare with the result
from the PST formalism. It can be seen from the
discussion in the literature that double dimen-
sional reduction of the M5-brane action in the
original PST action [ 4], [6], [7] on a circle is
given by the dual D4-brane action, which can be
realised as a duality transformation [ 26] of the
D4-brane action. Alternatively, if one starts with
the dual formulation of the M5-brane action [ 5],[13], then it can be shown that double dimen-
sional reduction on a circle directly gives rise
to the D4-brane action. As for the case of Sen
formalism, we have seen in this subsection that
essentially by dualising some components of P,we
obtain as a result of double dimensional reduc-
tion of the complete M5-brane action on a circle,
the D4-brane action. Therefore, it seems that the
original PST M5-brane action naturally gives rise,
after double dimensional reduction on a circle, to
dual D4-brane action. On the other hand, the Sen
M5-brane action seems to naturally give rise to
D4-brane action. In fact, as will be demonstrated
in the next subsection, it can be seen that the Sen
M5-brane action also naturally give rise to dual
D4-brane action.
3.3 Dual D4-brane action from Sen
M5-brane action
Wehavelearnedfromtheprevioussectionthatthe
key steps of double dimensional reduction of the
M5-braneactionin Senformalismtothe D4-brane
action areessentially to dualise components Pabof
Pandtheneliminate Q.Theﬁve-dimensionalDBI
gauge ﬁeld Aand unphysical ﬁeld A(s)then arise
as linear combinations of the Lagrange multiplier
and the remaining components Pa5ofP.
In fact, by slightly modifying the procedure, it
is possible to obtain the dual D4-brane action by
dimensionally reducing Sen M5-brane action. The
modiﬁcation is simply to switch the role of the
components of Pso that we dualise components
Pa5and as to be seen at the end of the process
that components of Pabalong with the Lagrange
multiplier will be linearly combined to form gauge
ﬁeld and unphysical ﬁeld.
Let us show this in more details. We follow the
same steps as those of the previous section up to
eq.(3.21). Then, by deﬁning
Yab= 2∂[aPb]5 (3.41)

The action ( 3.59) describes the complete dual D4-
brane action [ 26] decoupled with unphysical ﬁeld.
3.4 Duality from the viewpoint of
Sen M5-brane action
It is well known that the D4-brane part of the
action (3.37) and the dual D4-brane part of the
action (3.59) are related by duality transforma-
tion. This can be shown [ 26] by considering the
dualisation of Aain the D4-brane action, which
then gives rise to the dual D4-brane action. More
explicitly, one replaces 2 ∂[aAb]in the D4-brane
action byψab,treats the latter as an independent
ﬁeld, introduces a 3 −form Lagrange multiplier χ
which puts ψab= 2∂[aAb],then ﬁnally integrates
outAaandψab.This process gives rise to the dual
D4-brane action, in which the Lagrangemultiplier
χbecomes the ﬁeld strength of the 2-form ﬁeld B.
It can be shown from the viewpoint of dimen-
sionally reduced Sen M5-brane action that the
action (3.37) and (3.59) are dual to each other.
The prove can be performed quite simply by not-
ing that the action ( 3.37) is equivalent to the
action (3.24), whereas the action ( 3.59) is equiv-
alent to the action ( 3.43). Let us replace ( ∂K)ab
and (∂P)abin the action ( 3.24) by Φ(1)
aband Φ(2)
ab,
respectively. Let us treat Φ(1)

pendent ﬁelds and impose Lagrange multipliers

in mind that indices for q,Φ(1),Φ(2)are raised
and lowered by η,and denoting Θ(1)
ij=−Pijand
Θ(2)
ij=Kij,we obtain eq.( 3.43). This ﬁnishes the
proof in the viewpoint of Sen formalism that the
D4-brane action and the dual D4-brane action are
dual to each other.
4 Towards dimensional
reduction of the Sen
M5-brane action on other
spaces
In [18], [20], analyses of dimensional reductions
of the 6d Sen quadratic action are given. The
examples of the spaces are a circle, a torus, K3,
and a non-compact Riemann surface. Further-
more, in section 3we have demonstrated that
when non-linearising to the Sen M5-brane action,
thedimensionalreductiononacirclecannaturally
be given. In particular, it is natural to give, basedon the procedure of double dimensional reduc-
tion, either D4-brane action or dual D4-brane
action. Note that these results suggest a remark-
able feature of the Sen formalism that although
its quadarticaction couples to gravityin a compli-
cated way, dimensional reduction on various cases
of spaces can naturally be performed.
In contrast, in the PST formalism, although
dimensional reduction can in principle be per-
formed on any spaces, it is more natural to use
speciﬁc action for dimensional reduction on a spe-
ciﬁc space. For example, it is natural to perform
dimensional reduction of the original PST action
[4], [6], [7] and its dual version [ 5], [13] on a cir-
cle giving rise respectively to D4-brane and dual
D4-brane actions, whereas it is natural to perform
dimensionalreductionofthe3+3M5-braneaction
[12] onT3to give an M2-brane action.
In this section, we will work towards general-
ising the analysis in section 3so that it applies
also to dimensional reductions on other spaces.
We will only focus on special cases which contain
some particular ways of dimensional reductions.
We will also only give an outline of the analy-
sis. The explicit details will be studied as future
works. We expect that the analysis in this section
could be served as a base for further generalisa-
tions, for example, double dimensional reduction
of the complete M5-brane action on T5−pto give
Dp-brane with p <4 (the case p= 4 has been
given in the previous sections).
4.1 An outline of the analysis
Let us consider dimensional reduction of the
Sen M5-brane action ( 2.7) from a 6 dimensional
spacetime M6=DD× C6−Dwith coordinates2
xµ,µ= 0,1,2,···,5 to aDdimensional topo-
logically trivial spacetime DDwith coordinates
xa,a= 0,1,···,D−1.Let ﬁelds be independent
from the coordinates xα,α=D,D+ 1,···,5 of
the compact space C6−D.Denotedandˆdto be the
exterior derivative on M6andDD,respectively.
OnM6,letusdenotea3-formcoordinatebasis

2In this section, middle Greek alphabets for example µ,ν,ρ
are used as indices of coordinates on M6.Roman alphabets for
example a,b,c,i,j,k,m,n are used as indices of coordinates
onDD.Beginning Greek alphabets for example α,βare used
as indices of coordinates on C6−D.

I=1BI.Therefore, the projection
operators satisfy

I=1PI= /BD, (4.2)
∗′PI∗′=YIJPJ, (4.3)
whereYIJare constants. Let us also impose a
condition that the projection operators PIsatisfy
the property that for any 2-form Awhich is inde-
pendent from coordinates of C6−D,there exists a
2-formAIsuch that
PIdA=ˆdAI. (4.4)
SinceAis independent from xα,it can easily be
seen thatAIare also independent from xα.Let
us require furthermore that the ﬁrst nprojection
operators PˆI,ˆI= 1,2,···,n,are related to the
lastnprojection operators P¯I,¯I=n+ 1,n+
2,···,2n,by
∗′PˆI∗′=δˆI,¯J−nP¯J. (4.5)
Therefore,
Y¯I¯J=YˆIˆJ= 0, YˆI¯J=Y¯JˆI=δˆI,¯J−n.(4.6)
Let us replace dPin eq.(2.7) byXand intro-
duce Lagrange multiplier ˜Pwhich puts dX= 0.

Euler-Lagrange equation for Xis given by

eq.(4.8) into eq.( 4.7), we would obtain the action
as in eq.( 2.7) withPreplaced by ˜P.This is not
the resulting action we are interested in. So let us
instead only substitute the components P¯JXfrom
eq.(4.8):
P¯JX=−2P¯JQ−P¯J∗′d˜P. (4.9)

Note that if ωis a diﬀerential p-form on M6
and is independent on coordinates xαofC6−D,
we havedω=ˆdω≡dxa∧∂aω.In particular, if
ˆdω= 0,then by expressing in index-notation and
usingthe fact that the D-dimensional spacetimeis
topologically trivial, it can be shown, for example
by expressing in index notation, that there exists
a (p−1)-formφonM6such that it is independent
onxαand thatω=ˆdφ.
The Euler-Lagrange equations for ˜Pare
ˆd(2P¯JP¯JQ+∗′PˆIPˆId˜P−PˆIPˆIX) = 0,(4.11)
which imply
2P¯JP¯JQ+∗′PˆIPˆId˜P−PˆIPˆIX=−ˆdP,(4.12)
where we denote the arbitrary xα-independent
2−form on the 6-dimensional spacetime as P.Let
us apply PˆIon eq.(4.12). This gives
PˆIX=PˆIˆdP. (4.13)

where we discard the integral of total derivative.
The next task is to eliminate Qby solving its
Euler-Lagrange equations and substituting back
intotheaction( 4.14).Letusarguethatthisisvery
diﬃcult,ifatallpossible,toapproachthisdirectly.
In principle, the Euler-Lagrange equations of Q
wouldnot besuﬃcient tocompletelydetermine Q.
One should also realise self-duality and non-linear
self-duality conditions. In particular, one should
solveeq.( 2.14)to determine Rin termsofQ,g,C 3.
The resulting expression of Qis expected to be in
termsofP,˜P,g,C 3.Itislikelythat thisexpression
would be complicated so that it is not even clear
if it can be expressible in a closed form.
With the insight gained from the analysis in
section3, one may approach this strategically. Let
us ﬁrst consider the Euler-Lagrange equations for
Qwhich can be expressed as
PˆIR=PˆIQ+1
2PˆI(dP+d˜P).(4.15)
Note that one can see from eq.( 4.15) that some
projections of F=Q−R+C3turn out to be
expressibleassimpleexpressionsof Pand˜P.That
is
PˆIF=−1
2PˆI(dP+d˜P)+PˆIC3,(4.16)
which when using the property eq.( 4.4), the ﬁrst
term on the RHS of eq.( 4.16) is an exact diﬀeren-
tial form. One may use eq.( 4.15) to express Rin
termsofQthenuseeq.( 2.14)toexpress Qinterms
ofPˆIF.The idea is that the collection {PˆIF|ˆI=
1,2,···,n}contains ten components of F.The
other ten components which are contained in the
collection {P¯JF|¯J=n+1,n+2,···,2n}can in
principle be expressed in terms of PˆIFby using
non-linear self-duality relation of F. This meansthat eq.( 2.14) can be used to express
P¯JF=ˆV¯J(PˆIF,g), (4.17)
whereˆV¯J(PˆIF,g) is a diﬀerential 3-form which is
a function of PˆIFandg.Then by using F=Q−
R+C3along with eq.( 4.15)-(4.17), we obtain
PˆIQ=1
2PˆIF+1
2YˆI¯J∗′ˆV¯J(PˆIF,g)−1
2PˆI(C3+∗′C3).
(4.18)
Let us then substitute eq.( 4.15) and eq.( 4.18) into
the action ( 4.14). Note also that we may sub-
stitute the components P¯JFfrom eq.( 4.17) into
the expression of U(F,g) leaving only the depen-
dencyon PˆIFandg.Moreexplicitly,wehaveafter
substitution,
U(F,g) =ˆU(PˆIF,g). (4.19)

4.2 Duality
In subsection 3.4, we haveseen that there is a sim-
ple way to realise the duality between D4-brane
and dual D4-brane. From the point of view of the
Sen M5-brane action, the duality is realised by
simply switching the roles of components of P.In
fact, it is naturaltoextend this ideatothe casesof
dimensional reduction to even lower dimensions.
Let us start by giving a quick summary to
the result of subsection 4.1as follows. Con-
sider a dimensional reduction of the M5-brane
action (2.7) to aDdimensional spacetime. The
appropriate choice of 2 nprojection operators
satisfy eq.( 4.1)-(4.6) are also chosen. It turns
out that only the ﬁrst nprojection operators
P1,P2,···,Pnexplicitly appear in the reduced
action (4.23), which let us denote as S1,2,3,···,n.
If we swap for example P1withPn+1,the pro-
jection operators would still satisfy the properties
(4.1)-(4.6). Therefore, we may obtain the reduced
actionSn+1,2,3,···,nwhich is explicitly described
by the projection operators Pn+1,P2,P3,···,Pn.
In fact,the theories S1,2,3,···,nandSn+1,2,3,···,n
are related by duality transformation. We ﬁrst
note that the action S1,2,3,···,nis equivalent to
the action ( 4.14). Focusing on terms involving
P1Q,P1dP,P1d˜P,we may express the action
(4.14) as
S1,2,3,···,n

Note that by using the property ( 4.4) and the
fact thatPand˜Pare independent from xα,we
may express
P1dP=ˆdP1,P1d˜P=ˆd˜P1.(4.26)
In the action ( 4.24), let us set Φ ≡ˆdP1,˜Φ≡ˆd˜P1
and introduce Lagrange multiplier to set ˆdΦ =
ˆd˜Φ = 0 and P1Φ = Φ,P1˜Φ =˜Φ.So

ysis of section 3, in whichD= 5.So if we deﬁne
P1,P2such that
P1(dxµ∧dxν∧dxρ) = 3δµνρ
ij5dxi∧dxj∧dx5,
P2(dxµ∧dxν∧dxρ) =δµνρ
ijkdxi∧dxj∧dxk,(4.31)
then the physical part of the action ( 4.23)
describes a D4-brane. But if we deﬁne
P1(dxµ∧dxν∧dxρ) =δµνρ
ijkdxi∧dxj∧dxk,
P2(dxµ∧dxν∧dxρ) = 3δµνρ
ij5dxi∧dxj∧dx5,(4.32)
then the physical part of the action ( 4.23)
describes a dual D4-brane.
By similar considerations, any pair
(Pk,Pk+n),k= 1,2,···,nof projection operators
can be swapped and that it is also possible to
swap more than one pair at a time. The resulting
actionis dualto the originalaction. Forsimplicity,
let us discuss an example case where the action is
quadratic. In this case, the action ( 4.23) is

,
(4.33)
where the form of ˆV¯J(ˆFˆI,g) will be given on a case
by case basis by rearranging the 6d ∗−self-duality
condition of F.In particular, let us consider an example case
in whichD= 4,the compact space is a torus,
and the 6d metric is g=g4⊕g2.Let us pick the
projection operators as follows
P1(dxµ∧dxν∧dxρ) = 6δµνρ
i45dxi∧dx4∧dx5,
P2(dxµ∧dxν∧dxρ) = 3δµνρ
ij4dxi∧dxj∧dx4,
P3(dxµ∧dxν∧dxρ) =δµνρ
ijkdxi∧dxj∧dxk,
P4(dxµ∧dxν∧dxρ) = 3δµνρ
ij5dxi∧dxj∧dx5.(4.34)
Furthermore, let us consider a consistent trunca-
tion by setting
ˆF1=ˆF3=P1C3=P3C3= 0,(4.35)
or in component form
Fi45=Fijk=Ci45=Cijk= 0.(4.36)
This example case is exactly what studied before
in [18] in whichg4=η4is the ﬂat 4d metric. Here,
however, we shall generalise this by taking g4to
be a general 4d metric which depends on the 4d
coordinates xi.The∗-self-duality condition of F

The action ( 4.38) and its dual ( 4.39) transform to
each other under the S-duality transformation
g44/ma√sto→g55, g45/ma√sto→ −g45, g55/ma√sto→g44,(4.40)
Fij4/ma√sto→ −Fij5, Fij5/ma√sto→Fij4,
Cij4/ma√sto→ −Cij5, Cij5/ma√sto→Cij4.(4.41)
Note that the transformation ( 4.40) is equivalent
to
τ/ma√sto→ −1
τ, (4.42)
where
τ=−g45+i/radicalbig

The transformation ( 4.42) is what expected from
the conformal symmetry of the 6d action of self-
dual 3-form [ 25]. Furthermore, in the context of
D3-brane,τencodes axion and dilation as τ=
C0+ie−φ,whereasCij4andCij5are identiﬁed
withB2andC2.Thetransformations( 4.40)-(4.41)
is precisely the S-duality transformation for D3-
brane.
It is clear that the reduced theories ( 4.38)-
(4.39) we have obtained is expressed entirely in
terms of standard ﬁelds. This is possible largely
due to that we have chosen appropriate projection
operators, in particular the ones which project to
ij4 orij5 components. On the other hand, for the
choice studied in [ 18], in which the components
ˆiˆjαwhereˆi,ˆj∈ {1,2,3},α∈ {4,5}are chosen,
it is not yet clear whether the Lagrangian can be
expressed entirely in terms of standard ﬁelds.
Note that due to the expected form of the
reduced theory under dimensional reduction andhow it transforms under S-duality, it could be
expected that if one considers double dimensional
reduction of the complete Sen M5-brane action
(2.7) on a torus, then one could obtain the com-
plete D3-brane action on a circle. Indeed, explicit
checks are required. If this succeeds, one may
then compare and contrast the approach with its
counterpart [ 28] given in the PST formalism.
It is remarkable that the duality can easily be
obtained simply by appropriately swapping the
projection operators. In fact, since the analysis
only involves mainly the ﬁeld Pand projec-
tion operators, similar analysis for the duality of
dimensional reduction of self-dual (2 p+ 1)-forms
in 4p+2 dimensions in Sen formalism can easily
be performed. This way that dualities of dimen-
sionally reduced theories are realised in the Sen
formalism is another property which makes the
Senformalismappealing.Ofcourse,furthereﬀorts
are still required to eliminate Qfrom each action
to arrive at the ﬁnal form.
5 Conclusion and Discussion
In this work, we have studied double dimensional
reduction of the Sen M5-brane action ( 2.7). In
particular, we have explicitly shown that dou-
ble dimensional reduction of the Sen M5-brane
action on a circle indeed gives, depending on how
the projection operators are chosen, the complete
D4-brane action or the complete dual D4-brane
action. The procedure we have followed is essen-
tially just a slight modiﬁcation of that given in
[20]. It is remarkable that although the Sen M5-
brane action couples to gravity in a complicated
way and that there are ﬁelds which do not trans-
form in the standard way under diﬀeomorphism,
it seems that dimensionalreduction can be carried
out relativelysimply givingrise to reduced actions
which describe dynamics of ﬁelds which transform
in a standard way under diﬀeormorphism.
We have also outlined an extension of dimen-
sional reduction on other spaces. The analysis
suggests that provided that one picks projection
operators which satisfy eq.( 4.1)-(4.6), the dimen-
sional reduction of the Sen M5-brane action gives
rise to the reduced action ( 4.23) which contains
standard ﬁelds.
Note that one aspect which makes the pro-
cedure of dimensional reduction simple despite
17the aforementioned complications of the Sen M5-
brane action is that it allows one to easily inte-
grating out Q.In particular, it avoids the need
to explicitly express Rin terms of Q,g,C 3.As a
future work,it wouldbe interestingto see whether
it is possible to extend and modify the procedure
to show explicitly that the Sen M5-brane action is
equivalenttothe M5-braneactionsin PSTformal-
ism. We anticipate that if this is at all possible,
the procedure should also allow one to integrate
outQin a simple way.
We have found another remarkable feature of
Sen M5-brane action that dualities of dimensional
reduced action seem to be encoded within the Sen
M5-brane action. For example, as demonstrated
explicitly in this paper, in the viewpoint of string
theory, it would take some eﬀorts to show that
the D4-brane and dual D4-brane actions are dual
to each other. On the other hand, from the view-
point of the Sen M5-brane action, the D4-brane
and dual D4-brane actions can be put in a simi-
lar form. This can be seen by comparing eq.( 3.24)
and eq.(3.43), which can be transformed to each
other simply by swapping the projection opera-
tors between eq.( 4.31) and eq.( 4.32). We have also
shownthatthis swappingisaresultofdualisation.
We have outlined a generalisation to dimen-
sional reduction on other manifolds. As long as
the projection operators can be given to satisfy
(4.1)-(4.6),the processwillgiverisetothereduced
action (4.23) whose physical part describe ﬁelds
which transform under standard diﬀeomorphism.
Apart from the D4-brane and dual D4-brane
actions, it can be expected that the action ( 4.23)
should also give rise to other complete actions in
stringtheory and M-theoryforexample D3-brane,
D2-brane, D1-brane, F1-brane, M2-brane actions
and whether S-dualities in these cases are the
results of simple swapings of the projection oper-
ators. For completeness, explicit checks should be
made in each case.
The analysis for dimensional reduction on
other spaces as given in section 4heavily relies
on the assumption that the projection operators
should satisfy eq.( 4.1)-(4.6). It would be interest-
ing to see whether the analysis can be extended to
the cases where some of the properties ( 4.1)-(4.6)
aregeneralised. In any case, it would alsobe inter-
esting to consider dimensional reduction of the
Sen M5-brane action on other spaces. In particu-
lar, one might consider the dimensional reductionof the Sen M5-brane action on Riemann surface
and K3. This is to see non-linear extension to the
result of [ 20].
It could also be expected that other kinds
of dimensional reduction for the Sen M5-brane
action could also easily be carried out. In par-
ticular, the null dimensional reduction on a (2,0)
theory in the Sen formalism has been carried out
in [21]. So one might try to use a similar method
to study the null reduction of the Sen M5-brane
action.
Although the analysis in section 4is given
explicitly for the six-dimensional Sen M5-brane
action, the extension especially for the quadratic
version which describes self-dual (2 p+1)-form on
4p+2 dimensional spacetime can easily be done.
In particular,for the case p= 2,the Sen quadratic
actiondescribestype IIB supergravity.Soit would
also be interesting to study how the dimensional
reduction of type IIB supergravity is realised in
Sen formalism.
