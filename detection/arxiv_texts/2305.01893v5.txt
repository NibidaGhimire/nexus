An analytical study with respect to the nonlinear correctio ns for the nuclear gluon distribution
function in the next-to-leading order approximation at sma llxis presented. We consider the
nonlinear corrections to the nuclear gluon distribution fu nctions at low values of xandQ2
using the parametrization F2(x,Q2) and using the nuclear modiﬁcation factors where they have
been obtained with the Khanpour-Soleymaninia-Atashbar-S piesberger-Guzey model. The CT18
gluon distribution is used as baseline proton gluon density atQ2
0= 1.69 GeV2. We discuss the
behavior of the gluon densities in the next-to-leading orde r and the next-to-next-to-leading order
approximations at the initial scale Q2
0, as well as the modiﬁcations due to the nonlinear correction s.
We ﬁnd the QCD nonlinear corrections are signiﬁcant for the n ext-to-leading order accuracy
than the next-to-next-to-leading order for light and heavy nuclei. The results of the nonlinear
GLR-MQ evolution equation are similar to those obtained wit h the Rausch-Guzey-Klasen gluon
upward and downward evolutions within the uncertainties. T he magnitude of the gluon distribution
with the nonlinear corrections increases with a decrease of xand an increase of the atomic number A.
1. Introduction
The dynamics of parton interactions and the partonic structure o f nuclei are prime subjects of research for both
particle and nuclear physics. The formation of quark-gluon plasma in side nuclei is explored during the very ﬁrst
fractions of fm /cin high-energy nuclear collisions. This probe is due to a large momentum (or mass)Q≫ΛQCDscale,
which is the main motivation for studying nuclear parton distributions . According to the knowledge of the parton
distribution functions (PDFs) offree nucleons which comes from th e measurementsof deeply inelastic scattering(DIS)
in lepton-nucleon ( lN) collisions, the program of extracting nuclear PDFs (nPDFs) also re lies on the DIS data [1-3].
The HERA data for the free proton reached x∼10−5in perturbative values of Q2, while the DIS-measurements for
nuclear targets are bound to severely higher momentum fractions ,x/greaterorsimilar10−2.
In Ref.[4], the authors studied the prospects for constraining the nuclear parton distribution functions by small- xdeep
inelastic scattering at the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) [5] where its extension of the kinematic covers 4
orders of magnitude in DIS. The eﬀect of high-precision DIS-measu rements at the LHeC in Ref.[4] is illustrated by
the ratio of the reduced, inclusive DIS cross-sections, σA
reduced(x,Q2)/σp
reduced(x,Q2), where

wherex,yandQ2are the standard DIS variable, and Ais the number of nucleons in a nuclear target. The LHeC
promises the equivalent of 1 fb−1of luminosity for ePb collisions at LH(e)C energies. With its large Q2and 1/xrange
nuclear shadowing can be measured very precisely.
At high energies, nuclear shadowing is controlled by coherence eﬀec ts. Namely, shadowing is possible only if the
coherence time exceeds the mean inter-nucleon spacing in nuclei an d shadowing saturates if the coherence time
substantially exceeds the nuclear radius [6-8]. Nuclear shadowing at smallx(i.e.,x/lessorsimilar0.1) is experimentally well
studied by NMC [9]. Experiments at CERN and Fermilab focus especially o n the region of small values of the Bjorken
variablexand show a systematic reduction of the nuclear structure functio nFA
2(x,Q2)/Awith respect to the free
proton structure function Fp
2(x,Q2). This phenomenon is known as nuclear shadowing eﬀect and is assoc iated to the
modiﬁcation of the target parton distributions so that xfA

with splitting functions Pijgoverning the scale evolution. For evolution of the PDFs due to the e volution equation
(i.e., Eq.(3)), a non-perturbative input at some initial scale is require d to obtain a PDF set. The baseline parton
distributions of a proton are parametrized in the following formal fo rm
fi(x,Q2
0) =α0xα1−1(1−x)α2Pi(y,α3,α4,...), (4)
where the coeﬃcients α1andα2control the asymptotic behavior of fi(x,Q2
0) in the limits x→0 and 1, and Piis a
sum of Bernstein polynomials dependent on y=f(x) which is very ﬂexible across the whole interval 0 <x<1. For
PDFs of nuclei, an additional dependence on the atomic mass A is requ ired [12,14,19]. In Ref.[20], the authors are
discussed the nuclear cross section in terms of nuclear volume and s urface contributions
σA=AσV+A2/3σS. (5)
Therefore, the cross section per nucleon is assumed to be propor tional to 1/A1/3as
σA
A=σV+1
A1/3σS. (6)
IfσVandσSdepend weakly on A, the 1 /A1/3dependence makes sense as the leading approximation.
A much harder task has been to determine the gluon distribution of n ucleons bound in a nucleus, i.e., the nuclear
gluon distribution ( xgA(x,Q2)). The kinematic extension of the the electron - Ion collider (EIC) [2 1,22] will allow
us to examine the non-linear dynamics at low x. When the gluon density becomes suﬃciently large at small x, one
needs to take into account the eﬀects of gluon recombination (gluo n-gluon fusion) leading to nonlinear corrections
to the DGLAP evolution equations [23-25]. Indeed the gluon-gluon re combination processes cause that the growth
of the gluon density is slowed down at smaller values of xandQ2(but stillQ2≫Λ2
QCD). In the Gribov-Levin-
Ryskin-Mueller-Qiu (GLR-MQ) approach [23,24], the gluon recombinat ion is addressed by analyzing so-called ”fan”
diagrams, where two gluon ladders merge into a gluon or a quark-ant iquark pair. Adding these contributions to
the DGLAP equations yields the nonlinear GLR-MQ evolution equations [23,24], where the nonlinear term tames
the growth of the PDFs at small xand leads to their suppression. One of the important outcomes of s tudied in
Ref.[26] is the existence of the saturation scale Qs(x) (Q2
s=Q2
0(x/x0)−λwhereQ0andx0are free parameters)
which is a characteristic scale at which the parton recombination eﬀe cts become important. The solution to the
non-linear equation has the property of the geometric scaling in the regime where k < Q s(x) whereas in the case
whenk>Q s(x) the solution enters the linear regime, where kis the gluon transverse momenta.
Eﬀects of small- xnonlinear corrections to the DGLAP evolution equations due to gluon recombination have been
extensively studied in the literature [27-32]. Recently in Ref.[33], the a uthors have considered the nonlinear GLR-MQ
evolution equations for nPDFs using the ”brute force” method in th e momentum space. The authors [33] conﬁrmed
the importance of the nonlinear corrections for small x/lessorsimilar10−3, whose magnitude increases with a decrease of xand
an increase of the atomic number A. This paper is organized as follows . In the next section the theoretical formalism
is presented, including the GLR-MQ evolution equation. In section 3, we present a detailed analytical analysis and
our main results for the nuclear gluon density and predictions of the non-linear eﬀects at higher order accuracy. In
the last section we summarize our ﬁndings.3
2. Formalism
The nonlinear corrections in the GLR-MQ evolution equations for nPD Fs are deﬁned by the following forms1

∂lnQ2|DGLAPfor the parton distributions refer to the standard DGLAP evolutio n equations. Here Ris the
characteristic radius of the gluon distribution in the hadronic targe t.RAfor a nuclear target with the mass number
A is deﬁned by RA= 2 GeV−1×A1/3[33]. The value of 2 GeV−1depends on how the gluons have a hotspot-like
structure within the nucleon. Here χ=x
x0andx0is the boundary condition that the gluon distribution joints
smoothly onto the linear region. The second terms in the right-hand sides of Eqs.(7) and (8) are expected to become
important and related to the recombination of the gluons in the low- xregion, when the gluon density is very large.
This is known as the phenomenon of gluon saturation.
Since the parton distributions in bound and free protons are diﬀere nt,fA(x,Q2)/ne}ationslash=f(x,Q2), therefore the ratio of
structure functions is observed to deviate clearly from unity. The nuclear modiﬁcations at x/lessorsimilar0.1 are referred to as
shadowing. The nuclear structure function FA
2, in the QCD-improved parton model (in leading order (LO) of αs, or
in the DIS-scheme in any higher order), can be written in terms of its parton distributions as

The nonlinear equations (i.e., Eqs.(7) and (8)) show that the strong rise that is corresponding to the linear QCD
evolution equation at small- xandQ2can be tamed by screening eﬀects. After successive integrating o f both sides of
Eqs.(7) and (8) with respect to ln Q2and some rearranging, we ﬁnd the nonlinear distribution functions in terms of

and obtained from the coupled DGLAP evolution equations using the m odiﬁed nuclear distribution functions at
the initial scale2. The initial nuclear parton distributions are provided at a ﬁxed Q2(≡Q2

fA

The nuclear modiﬁcation is based on the QCD analysis available in the liter ature [14, 19, 34-38], and assume the

termdiin contrast to a quadratic-type function, i.e., without di, is that the weight function becomes ﬂexible enough
to accommodate both shadowing and anti-shadowing in the valence q uark distributions [14].
The nonlinear corrections enter both the gluon and the sea-quark distributions at small xthrough (i) modiﬁcations
of the initial distributions and (ii) the presence of additional nonlinea r terms in the Q2-evolution equations. To study
the possible importance of nonlinear corrections, we base our initial gluon and singlet distribution xgNLC(x,Q2

xqNLC

The nonlinear terms in the right-hand side of evolution equations (i.e., Eqs.(7) and (8)) are deﬁned by xgA
sat, and this
is the value of the gluon which would saturate the unitarity limit in the lea ding shadowing approximation. In Fig.1
we show the gluon saturation as a function of the mass number A is ex pected to occur for various values of Q2[40].
In Fig.2, the gluon distribution, αsxgA
satincreases as the mass number A increase at the initial scale Q2
0= 1.69 GeV2
[41]. Therefore, the eﬀect of the gluon saturation is expected to b e larger in heavy nuclei, and to be important for
small values of Q2.
We rewrite Eq.(17) by using Eq.(16), to take into account the nonline ar correction to the nuclear gluon distribution

The weight function wi(x,A,Z) for the linear distribution functions can be obtained from the thre e constrains for

For a detailed investigation of these functions, we constrain our re sults to the functions deﬁned in Ref.[35]. The gluon
distribution at low xis dominant, therefore we used the standard gluon distribution at t he input scale Q2

where the coeﬃcients at the next-to-leading order (NLO) and the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) approxi-
mations are listed in Ref.[35]. The strong coupling is set equal to αs(Mz) = 0.118 for both the NLO and NNLO
approximations. In Figs.3 and 4, we show representations of the no nlinear corrections to the gluon modiﬁcation
functions at the initial scale Q2
0= 1.69 GeV2for two selected nuclei, C-12 and Pb-208 at the NLO and NNLO ap-
proximations, respectively. The nuclear gluon distribution function s are analyzed using the CT18 proton PDF set as
a baseline in these ﬁgures (i.e., Figs.3 and 4) [43]. The nuclear modiﬁcatio n factors have been extracted from QCD
ﬁts to the nuclear and neutrino(antineutrino) DIS and Drell-Yan da ta6. The resulting nonlinear corrections to the
gluon distribution function are presented in Fig.5 for carbon (left) a nd iron (right) at Q2
0= 2 GeV2in the NLO
approximation. To achieve this, we used of the gluon distribution for a free proton deﬁned in Ref.[44] as
xg(x,Q2
0) =Agxαg(1−x)βg(1+γgxδg+ηgx), (24)
where the coeﬃcients at the NLO approximation are listed in Refs.[19,4 4]. The weight function for the nuclei of
carbon and iron has the same form in Eq. (16) which the coeﬃcients a re presented in Ref.[19] in which the eﬀects of
shadowing, anti-shadowing, fermi motion and the EMC regions are in cluded.
In Fig.6, we compare the nonlinear and linear gluon distributions in lead a t the NNLO approximation to those of
JR09 [45] at Q2
0= 2 GeV2. The nuclear gluon distribution is obtained from JR09 parametrizatio n at the input scale
by the following form of the free proton PDFs
xg(x,Q2
0) = 3.0076x0.0637(1−x)5.54473, (25)
where the parameters in weight function is listed in Ref.[34]. To quantif y the magnitude of NNLO corrections, we
present the nonlinear corrections of nuclear gluon distributions ob tained at the input scale of the CT18 and JR09
parametrizations in Figs.3, 4 and 6 for light and heavy nuclei. The Delta functions in these ﬁgures (i.e., Fis.3,4 and
6) show that the nonlinear and linear gluon distributions have a similar b ehavior at the input scale in a wide range
5The nonlinear terms will lead to a very small violation of the momentum sum rules, which can be recovered by a simple rescal ing of the
gluon distribution [39]. Recently, nonlinear corrections have been considered in Ref.[42] for the nucleons and nuclei .

For evolution of the nonlinear correctionsof the nuclear gluon distr ibutions, we need to a gluon analytical distribution
function for a free proton at the scale Q2in the NLO and NNLO approximations. In literatures, usually, the gluo n
analytical distribution function at the LO approximation have been d eﬁned. To do it, we extend the analytical
solution used in the DGLAP evolution to take into account the nonlinea r corrections in Eqs.(27) and (26) at the
NLO and NNLO approximations, respectively. We solve the DGLAP evo lution equation using Laplace transform
techniques in the next section.

According to the DGLAP Q2-evolution equations, the singlet distribution function leads to the f ollowing relation
of integro-diﬀerential equation

Consequently, we can rewrite Eq.(29) in the Laplace space s, by using the convolution theorem for Laplace transforms

The explicit expressions for the NLO and NNLO kernels in sspace are rather cumbersome; therefore, we recall that

Consequently, the discretized form of Eq.(32) for the gluon distrib ution reads
g(s,Q2) =h(ϕ)(αs(Q2),s)∂f2(s,Q2)
∂lnQ2−k(ϕ)(αs(Q2),s)f2(s,Q2), (40)
where the kernels k(ϕ)(αs(Q2),s) andh(ϕ)(αs(Q2),s) contain contributions of the s-space splitting and coeﬃcient

and
/hatwideJ(as(Q2),υ)≡L−1[h(αs(Q2),s);υ].
The kernels are dependent on υand the running coupling at the higher order approximations. In ord er to obtain
an analytical form for these kernels at higher order approximation s, we consider the terms of the order 1 /sas these
terms are dominant at higher order [53]. Therefore, we have

FIG. 7: The nonlinear gluon distribution function ( xgA,NLC(x,Q2)) and their uncertainties at Q2= 4,16 and 100 GeV2for
Au-197 compared with the results of the nonlinear GLR-MQ glu on distribution function (the RGK model) [33]. The dashed-d ot
lines (green and purple curves) are upward and downward evol utions [33].
Now we present our numerical results of the nonlinear gluon distribu tion for light and heavy nuclei in the x−Q2
kinematic regions, where the nonlinear corrections are important. The computed results of the nonlinear gluon
distribution function for Au-197 compare with the suggested meth od by Rausch, Guzey and Klasen (the RGK
model)[33]. This was based on the brute force method, where the au thors in Ref.[33] have been extended the
numerical algorithm used in the QCDNUM16 DGLAP evolution code [58] t o take into account the nonlinear
corrections as the nCTEQ15 nPDFs [59] are used as baseline PDFs.
In Fig.7 we show representations of the nonlinear gluon distribution f unctions for Au-197 at the scales Q2= 4,16
and 100 GeV2as a function of the momentum fraction xto show the eﬀects of the Q2evolution. The nuclear weight
functions for the gluon are extracted from the suggested metho d by Khanpour, Soleymaninia, Atashbar Tehrani,
Spiesberger and Guzey (the KSASG20 model) [35], where the CT18 nP DFs [43] are used as baseline PDFs. These
results are compared to the RGK model [33], where the nCTEQ15 nPD Fs [59] are used as baseline PDFs in the
nonlinear GLR-MQ evolution equation. In the RGK model, the dashed- dot curves show the results of the upward
evolution from Q2
0= 4 GeV2toQ2= 16 and 100 GeV2(green curves) and also show the results of the downward
evolution from Q2
0= 100 GeV2toQ2= 16 and 4 GeV2(purple curves) [33], respectively. The uncertainties, due
to the statistical errors of the coeﬃcient functions of the param etrization of the proton structure function [54] and
the nuclear modiﬁcation functions [35], are shown in Fig.7. For the NLO analysis, the nonlinear nuclear distribution
function for the gluon shows an increase as xdecreases, which is similar to what one can observe in the analyses
by RGK [33]. However, the magnitude of these results is slightly diﬀers at diﬀerent scales, but they are within the
uncertainties error bands. As can be seen in the ﬁgure, the nonline ar gluon densities come with relatively large error
bands at the critical point between the linear and nonlinear (i.e., x= 0.01), reﬂecting the fact that there are large
errors due to the coeﬃcients in the parametrization of the proton structure function.
In Fig.8, the nonlinear gluon distributions for C-12 and Pb-208 at the NLO approximation are considered at Q2= 4
and 100 GeV2as a function of xas accompanied with their uncertainties. To quantify the magnitude of the nonlinear
corrections, we present ratios of nuclear gluon distributions obta ined in the nonlinear corrections over those of the
linear. Figure 9 quantiﬁes the size of the nonlinear corrections as a f unction of the mass number A and xfor C-12
and Au-197 at Q2= 4 and 100 GeV2. The diﬀerence between the nonlinear and linear evolved gluon densit ies
grows steadily with a decrease of x. This is largest at the smallest values of xandQ2and disappears for x= 0.01.
The saturation gluon increases as the atomic number increases, th erefore the nonlinear/linear ratio decreases as the
atomic number increases. As one can see, the nonlinear/linear ratio is slightly larger for light nuclei than for heavy13

In Figs. (10) and (11), the nonlinear corrections to the gluon distr ibution function at the NLO approximation
for the nuclei C-12 and Pb-208 are presented at Q2= 10 and 100 GeV2as a function of the momentum fraction
x, respectively. In these ﬁgures, our numerical results, which are accompanied with statistical errors, are compared
with the linear results based on the KSASG20 (NLO) parametrization [35]. The KSASG20 parametrization is a new
set of nuclear parton distribution functions (nuclear PDFs) at the NLO and NNLO approximations in perturbative
QCD which include the new CT18 PDFs on proton PDFs. As can be seen in these ﬁgures, the eﬀects of nonlinear
corrections are noticeable at small xvalues and the strong growth of gluon distributions are tamed by sh adowing
eﬀects asxdecreases. The solid curves represent the eﬀect of shadowing co rrection for RA= 2A1/3GeV−1presented14

by using Eq.(45). As can be observed, the nuclear gluon distribution s increase as xdecreases, which corresponds with
the perturbative QCD ﬁts at small x, but these behaviors are tamed with respect to nonlinear terms at the GLR-MQ
equation. These tamed behaviors of nuclear gluon distributions due to the shadowing corrections satisfy the Froissart
bound in the perturbative QCD means. Hence, as one can see from F igs.10 and 11, deviations from the linear nuclear
gluon distributions based on the KSASG20 (NLO) parametrization inc reases asxdecreases. The deviations from the
KSASG20 (NLO) nPDFs increases as Q2increases and decreases as atomic number Aincreases (indeed the nonlinear15
nuclear gluon distributions increases as atomic number Aincreases), and signiﬁcant eﬀects are found for heavier nu-
clei, such as lead. These behaviorsfor the nonlinearnuclear gluon dis tributions aresimilar to the analysisof RGK [33].
5. Summary
In conclusion, we have studied the eﬀects of adding the nonlinear co rrections to the gluon distribution function
for light and heavy nuclei at small xanalytically. We used the parametrization of the proton structure function
to take into account an analytical solution for the gluon density at lo wxin the NLO approximation. The nuclear
modiﬁcation factors are obtained from KSASG20 nuclear PDFS which are based on the CT18 framework. The
shadowing eﬀects of the gluon distribution at small xthrough modiﬁcations of the starting distributions and the
presence of additional nonlinear terms in the initial point Q2
0at the NLO and NNLO approximations for light and
heavy nuclei considered. We obtained the nonlinear corrections fo r smallxin a wide range of Q2values. These results
show that the magnitude of the nonlinear corrections increases wit h a decrease of xand an increase of the atomic
numberA. Our results are consistent, within uncertainties, with the determ ination of nuclear gluon distribution
with the upward and downward evolution from the RGK model, which is b ased on the nCTEQ15 nPDFs as input.
Our determination of nuclear gluon distributions includes error estim ates obtained with respect to the coeﬃcient
errors in the parametrization of the proton structure function a nd the nuclear modiﬁcation function errors. We found
diﬀerences between our and RGK results at the NLO accuracy, whic h occur in diﬀerent assumptions such as the
input prameterizations and also the approximate relation between t he gluon distribution and the proton structure
function due to the Laplace transform method at low x. These results for the nonlinear corrections to the nuclear
gluon distribution function may be important for future experiment s at the Electron-Ion Collider [21,22], LHeC Col-

Appendix
Previous studies of the GLR-MQ terms in the context of extracting the parton distribution functions can be found
in Ref.[39]. The nonlinear evolution equations relevant at high gluon den sities have been studied at small xwhere we
expect annihilation or recombination of gluons to occur. A measurem ent ofg(x,Q2) in this region probes a gluon of
transverse size ∼1/Q, therefore the transverse area of the thin disc that they occup y is∼xg(x,Q2)/Q2. The shad-
owing eﬀects, at suﬃciently small xwhereW/lessorsimilarαs, can be calculated in perturbative QCD. Here W∼αs(Q2)
πR2Q2xg(x,Q2)
whereπR2is the transverse area and Ris the proton radius. The QCD evolution equation modiﬁed for the gluo n
distribution is deﬁned by the following form
∂xg(x,Q2)
∂lnQ2=Pgg⊗xg+Pgq⊗xqs−81
16α2
s(Q2)
R2Q2θ(x0−x)/integraldisplayx0
xdx′
x′[x′g(x′,Q2)]2, (47)
where theθfunction reﬂects the ordering in longitudinal momenta as for x≥x0the shadowing correction is negligible
(x0=10−2). The shadowing term has a minus sign because the scattering amplit ude corresponding to the gluon ladder
is predominantly imaginary. Equation (47) can be rewritten with a var iable change ( x′=x
z) as
∂xg(x,Q2)
∂lnQ2=∂xg(x,Q2)

There are also shadowing corrections to the evolution equation for the sea-quark distributions as

s(Q2)
160R2Q2[xg(x,Q2)]2+GHT, (49)16
where the higher dimensional gluon term G HTis here assumed to be zero.
The standard DGLAP evolution equation for singlet and gluon distribu tions has the following forms:
∂xg(x,Q2)
∂lnQ2|DGLAP=Pgq⊗xqs+Pgg⊗xg=αs(Q2)
