Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a powerful and flexible tool for information extraction and
modeling. In this study, we use DNNs to extract the Sivers functions by globally fitting Semi-
Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) data. To make predictions of this Transverse Momentum-
dependent Distribution (TMD), we construct a minimally biased model using data from COMPASS
and HERMES. The resulting Sivers function model, constructed using SIDIS data, is also used
to make predictions for Drell-Yan kinematics specific to the valence and sea quarks, with careful
consideration given to experimental errors, data sparsity, and complexity of phase space.

The development of modern information extraction
techniques has far outpaced experimental progress. Even
with decades of experimental results, there is limited data
on Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribu-
tion Functions (TMDs) for global analyses that can be
applied to a 3D phenomenological interpretation. Theo-
retical efforts are providing an ever-evolving framework
and toolbox to interpret the data, leading to new areas
of research that optimize information extraction unique
to spin physics and the internal structure of hadrons.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating data-driven re-
search with the superior capacity of deep neural networks
(DNNs) to be used as function approximators. DNNs can
learn to approximate any relationships contained within
data, provided there are no limits to the number of neu-
rons, layers, and computing power. With enough data
and training, such approximations can be made to nearly
any desired degree of accuracy.
The Sivers function is the most studied of the eight
leading-twist TMD distributions that pertain to polar-
ized nucleons. The Sivers distribution is naively time-
reversal odd and is expected to be process-dependent,
which leads to a distribution equal in magnitude but op-
posite in sign in Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering
(SIDIS) compared to the Drell-Yan (DY) process [1, 2].
The Sivers distribution, as measured from the transverse
single-spin asymmetries, provides information on the cor-
relation between the nucleon’s spin and the angular dis-
tribution of outgoing hadrons in SIDIS or the di-muons
in DY. The quark Sivers function, ∆Nfq/N↑, describes
the number density in momentum space of unpolarized
quarks inside the transversely polarized target nucleon
with nuclear spin ( N↑). A non-zero Sivers function indi-
cates a contribution of quark orbital angular momentum
to the target’s spin.
TMD extraction and modeling with sensitivity to
TMD evolution and factorization is critical and provides
predictive power in the collinear limit characterizing the
nonperturbative effects. Representing evolution also ac-
counts for the momentum-dependent QCD interactions
between partons inside the hadron, which affect their dis-arXiv:2304.14328v2  [hep-ph]  14 Aug 20232
tribution and can significantly impact observables. Some
theoretical approaches use the parton model approxi-
mation without TMD evolution and demonstrate good
agreement with experimental results. At the time of their
origin, these calculations assumed that evolution effects
in asymmetries are suppressed, as asymmetries are ratios
of cross-sections where evolution and higher-order effects
should cancel out [3–5]. The more modern picture [6]
implies this is likely an oversimplification. There is now
strong evidence that the main effect of evolution takes
place at lower energies ( <10 GeV) [6, 7], so it is precisely
this domain that offers the best opportunity to capture
these important QCD relations in TMD distributions.
On the other hand, studies that incorporated TMD evo-
lution, as seen in [8, 9], encountered difficulties and did
not achieve better agreement with the Drell-Yan data
compared to earlier analyses [4, 5, 10]. This situation
poses a challenge in confirming the validity of any theo-
retical implementation with respect to the TMD factor-
ization theorem or modern utilities required to preserve
it, particularly the scale-dependent universal nonpertur-
bative evolution kernel, the so-called Collins-Soper (CS)
kernel. However, the work in [7, 11] demonstrated the
conditional universality of the Sivers function using a si-
multaneous fit to SIDIS, Drell-Yan, and W/Z boson pro-
duction data, including TMD evolution and the universal
nonperturbative CS kernel extracted in [12] from unpo-
larized measurements. In contrast, the working principle
of DNNs as a means of extraction can facilitate the neces-
sary flexibility to capture not only the TMD and DGLAP
evolution features but also the full complexity of QCD.
In this regard, a carefully designed DNN model accom-
panied by a systematic method of extraction can incor-
porate not only the evolution features but other com-
ponents not yet quantifiable in the formalism. The in-
herent capacity for DNNs to reduce dimensionality and
organize intricate correlations in the data can be used to
help determine the correct theoretical implementation.
The challenge, of course, is that once captured in a DNN
model, disentangling these features into formal expres-
sions consistent with factorization is nontrivial, and we
expect it to be the focus of much future work.
The approach outlined in this article highlights the in-
herent flexibility of employing specialized DNNs in com-
bination with candidate multiplicative expressions hold-
ing some type of separate parameterization which may
carry incorrect ansatzes or assumptions (biases). This
can be done while still rendering a high-quality numeri-
cal model encoding all information available in the data.
These types of biases can be managed by training the
model with the biased term included. The DNN term
then becomes uniquely parameterized to account for the
biases. Consequently, the resulting combination of terms
in the model remains largely unbiased, even though each
individual term may not be independently meaningful.
The schema can not only facilitate the exploration of the
existing formalism found in the literature but also pro-
vides a means to derive and test novel phenomenologyusing a technique that can directly manage and study
the biases in individual terms. This will be discussed in
more detail in Section VI.
The phenomenology used to interpret and analyze ex-
perimental data relies on TMD factorization [13–22],
proven for single-spin asymmetries (SSAs) described in
terms of convolutions of TMDs. The Sivers function
has been previously extracted from SIDIS data by sev-
eral groups, with generally consistent results [4, 23–27].
All previous phenomenological fits of the Sivers function
(and other TMDs) require an ansatz characterizing the
shape of the distribution combined with an assumed form
of the Bjorken-x dependence. This can lead to ambiguity
in determining both the quantitative results from the fit
and the qualitative features of the momentum distribu-
tions and their associated dynamics. The function form
of the Bjorken-x dependence is usually offered only as a
placeholder and is assumed to at least contain the ap-
propriate ingredients to facilitate the extraction. This
is undoubtedly a considerable oversimplification but one
that has permitted significant progress. In the following
analysis, we perform a global fit with the goal of illustrat-
ing a method that can also permit significant progress
even with data limitations, and with assumptions, and
ansatzes in place. We focus on testing the extraction
ability of a DNN representing a single term to maxi-
mize information extraction and minimize both the fit
error and the analytical ambiguity associated with the
interpretation of a generic Bjorken-x dependence, Nq(x).
There are, of course, broader implications of how these
tools can be used to accelerate the field, some of which
we will also touch on through our extraction of the Sivers
function.
The exceptional capacity of DNNs to be ideal for func-
tion approximation is rigorously provable through the
Universal Approximation Theorem [28, 29]. This is the
advantage of DNNs over other machine learning (ML)
approaches. In this regard, even the mere existence of a
function implies that DNNs can be used to represent it
and work with it without actually knowing the function
form. With such a high-level abstraction, one can make
use of the available data and make assessments not other-
wise possible, even given an arbitrary degree of complex-
ity. The complexity can be contained in the data rela-
tionships as well as in the experimental uncertainties. In
order to make optimal use of experimental uncertainties,
a detailed analysis must be provided on their estimated
scale and correlations.
DNNs are also Turing-complete, implying the potential
to simulate the computational aspects of any real-world
general-purpose computing process. The implications are
that there is potential for a type of generalizable frame-
work that can be utilized and further developed over time
without the knowledge of the exact rigorous details of the
underlying mechanisms. Provided appropriately detailed
global models, higher-level symbolic regressions can then
be performed to infer the strict mathematical form. How-
ever, such an approach requires access to a significant3
amount of experimental data that holds the necessary
information. Without the necessary amount of quality
data, no matter the number of nodes or sophistication of
architecture, DNNs are limited in what useful informa-
tion they can extract, along with any other technique.
Even with this constraint, DNNs can make considerable
advancements with the use of sparse data with large ex-
perimental uncertainties. Generally, fitting with large
errors or performing computational tasks with inherent
fuzzy logic are tasks that are difficult to make optimal use
of modern computational resources. DNNs are uniquely
suited for such challenges.
In the remainder of this article, a first-level DNN ex-
traction of Nq(x) is performed to deduce the Sivers func-
tion from a global analysis using HERMES and COM-
PASS data. This investigation is exploratory, with the
intention of developing tools and techniques that mini-
mize error and maximize utility, which we hope to ex-
pand upon in further work. The choice in this article is
to focus on the Sivers function, rather than the unpo-
larized TMD fq/N(x, k⊥), is to more clearly demonstrate
the power of the method even given the limitations in
data. Our global fit of fq/N(x, k⊥) will be presented in
later work. The examination of Nqin relation to xis
prioritized over other possibilities only to illustrate how
generating functions can be utilized to measure and an-
alyze systematics arising from the extraction produced.
As we demonstrate in this work, this technique enables
a systematic enhancement of information extraction.
In Section II, we present the formalism of the Sivers
function and the kinematics for both SIDIS and DY. In
Section III, a discussion of the fitting techniques of Nq(x)
is presented with a focus on the methodology of the DNN
approach. Section IV explains in detail the extraction
technique, starting with model testing. We perform a
baseline fit using the classical Minuit χ2minimization
algorithm and then perform the DNN fit, demonstrating
with pseudodata the fidelity of the procedure. We then
walk through the final DNN fit to experimental data for
the polarized proton and the deuteron separately. The
results of the fits are presented in Section V. Some fur-
ther analysis and systematic studies are reported in Sec-
tion VI. Then in Section VII we present the implication
of the results in terms of the 3D tomography of the pro-
ton. In Section VIII, we perform a preliminary analysis
on TMD evolution and finally, in Section IX, some con-
cluding remarks are provided.
II. KINEMATICS AND FORMALISM
With the spin of the proton perpendicular to the trans-
verse plane, the Sivers function is expected to reflect an
anisotropy of quark momentum distributions for the up
and down quarks, indicating that their motion is in op-
posite directions [1, 2]. This is manifestly due to quark
orbital angular momentum (OAM). The most interest-
ing and relevant aspects of the OAM, such as magnitudeand partonic distribution shape as a function of the pro-
ton’s state, cannot be determined by the Sivers effect
alone. However, systematic studies can be performed
to investigate the full 3D momentum distribution of the
quarks in a transversely polarized proton, which can be
used in concert with other information to exploit multi-
dimensional partonic degrees of freedom using a variety
of hard processes. Here, we focus specifically on SIDIS
and DY, but it should be noted that there is significant
potential for broader model development that can come
from combining all available data from multiple processes
with additional constraints using the simultaneous DNN
fitting approach presented here.
The Sivers function describes a difference in probabil-
ities, which implies that it may not be positive definite.
Making a comparison between the Sivers function from
the DY process and the SIDIS process is still the focus
of much experimental and theoretical effort. Under time
reversal, the future-pointing Wilson lines are replaced by
past-pointing Wilson lines that are appropriate for fac-
torization in the DY process. This implies that the Sivers
function is not uniquely defined and cannot exhibit pro-
cess universality, as it depends on the contour of the Wil-
son line. This feature of the Sivers function is directly
tied to the QCD interactions between the quarks (or glu-
ons) active in the process, resulting in a conditional uni-
versality, as shown in [30],
∆Nfq/N↑(x, k⊥)
SIDIS=−∆Nfq/N↑(x, k⊥)
DY.(1)
This fundamental prediction still needs to be tested. Di-
rect sign tests [4, 10, 31] can be performed, but exper-
imental proof would require an analysis over a broad
phase space of both SIDIS and DY, with consideration
given to flavor and kinematic sensitivity for both valence
and sea quarks. Our analysis will, in part, rely on this re-
lationship rather than making direct tests of the validity
of the sign change.
A. SIDIS process
The Semi Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS)
process involves scattering a lepton off of a polarized nu-
cleon and measuring the scattered lepton and a frag-
mented hadron. In the nucleon-photon center of mass
frame, the nucleon three-momentum ⃗ pis along the z-axis
and its spin-polarization ⃗STis on the plane perpendic-
ular (transverse) to the ˆ z-axis. In Fig. 1 the struct-
quark, virtual-photon (with four-momentum ⃗ q), and the
lepton belong to a plane called “Lepton Plane” (repre-
sented in yellow). The fragmented-hadron with momen-
tum⃗ phand its projection onto the ˆ x−ˆy(i.e.⃗ phT) belong
to so-called “Hadron Plane” (represented in transparent-
green). Thus, the transverse momentum ⃗k⊥of the struck
quark and ⃗ phTare falling onto the transverse plane (rep-
resented in transparent-blue) perpendicular to both lep-
ton plane and hadron plane. The azimuthal angle ϕhof4

photon center-of-mass frame.
the produced hadron his the angle between the lepton
plane and the hadron plane [32].
To perform a global analysis using a generalized DNN
approach, it is not necessary to postulate an expression or
function form for the shape of the partonic distributions
or any aspects of the nonperturbative contribution which
encodes information about the intrinsic quark-gluon cor-
relations within the nucleon. But to provide a more care-
ful demonstration we do not generalize and focus directly
onNq(x) to explore using quality metrics in combina-
tion with techniques to improve the overall extraction.
It is useful to demonstrate this using a very standard ap-
proach that is already well-developed in the literature.
With this in mind the TMDs (FFs) xandk⊥(zand
p⊥) dependence are decoupled. It is common to apply
a Gaussian parametrization for the transverse momen-
tum dependence but this imposes a bias implying that
the transverse momentum is nonperturbative and pri-
marily driven by the intrinsic properties of the colliding
hadrons rather than hard gluon radiation. Such biases
can be managed by the technique itself which we ex-
pect to come clear through the examples to come. There
are several options for the choice of formalism and there
is still much ongoing debate on how formalism should
correctly be implemented for single-spin asymmetries to
best respect factorization theory. Our choice of formal-
ism is purely illustrative. There remains much ongoing
debate about this and we intend no favoritism in one
strategy over another. The focus of the present work is
the demonstration of how the methods and tools can be
implemented for arbitrary formalism. There are however
some very useful characteristics in one of the traditional
descriptions of the TSSA [33] that offer a clear means
of detailing the necessary steps. However, we stress that
the type of parameterization used in [4, 34] does not have
the complete features of TMD evolution but is compara-
ble to full TMD evolution at next-to-leading logarithmic
(NLL) accuracy.
The differential cross-section for the SIDIS processdepends on both collinear parton distribution func-
tions (PDFs) fq/N(x;Q2) and fragmentation functions
Dh/q(z;Q2), where qis the quark flavor, Nrepresents
the target nucleon, his the hadron type produced by
the process, and zis the momentum fraction of the final
state hadron with respect to the virtual photon. A sim-
plified version of the SIDIS differential cross-section can
be written up to O(k⊥/Q) as [26, 35],

carry the nucleon’s spin-polarization effects on the quarks
which can be considered as a modulation to the unpolar-
ized quark PDFs [4],

HereNq(x) is considered a factorized x-dependent func-
tion with a form that has yet to be formally estab-
lished. In fact the form of fq/N(x, k⊥) and h(k⊥) are
also assumed and these expressions should be consid-
ered embedded biases. For the best quality model of
the Sivers function, the form of fq/N(x, k⊥) could be
determined and parameterized separately using unpo-
larized data however, it is instructive to preserve these
original forms for this exercise. The parameter m1al-
lows the k⊥Gaussian dependence of the Sivers function
to be different from that of the unpolarized TMDs [4].
fq(x;Q2) is the collinear PDF for flavor qthat is ob-
tained from CTEQ6l [36] grid through LHAPDF [37] ini-
tially to be consistent with [4] during method testing and
later improved using NNPDF4.0 [38] for the real extrac-
tion, whereas the fragmentation functions for π±,0are
from [39], and for K±are from [40] (DSS formalism ),
from recent global analyses of fragmentation functions
at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in QCD.5
In terms of the cross-section ratios, the Sivers asym-
metry in the SIDIS process can be written as,

[43]. Note that we use the shorthand notation for the
PDFs, FFs as well as TMDs by omitting Q2in the ex-
pressions for the sake of convenience as is done in the
literature.
Through this azimuthal asymmetry, the SIDIS process
provides information about the correlations between the
transverse momentum of the partons leaving through the
fragmented target and the spin of the target itself. In
this regard, SIDIS allows one to study the structure of
individual hadrons by selecting these decay fragments at
the detection level. In general, SIDIS provides access to
a wide range of TMDs, and allows for studying TMDs of
hadrons carrying different flavors and polarizations.
For our present analysis, HERMES and COMPASS
have the best-polarized proton target data for SIDIS,
while COMPASS has the best-polarized neutron targetdata. In the COMPASS data, the neutron target is ac-
tually a polarized deuteron but the neutron carries over
90% of the deuteron polarization when polarized in solid-
state form. The JLab data on polarized3He is of a differ-
ent class of experiments and will not be combined with
the polarized deuteron data from COMPASS. It is worth
noting that the uncertainties in the experimental data
can greatly differ depending on the choice of polarized
target.

A↑is a transversely polarized target, and Bis the hadron

In the kinematical region of,

Note that here we follow the same convention as in
[3, 25, 44, 45] for the azimnuthal angle in the A−B
center-of-mass frame with the hadron A↑moving along
the positive z-axis and hadron Balong negative z-axis.
Thus the mixed product ⃗ST·(ˆp×ˆk⊥i) upon integration
ink⊥i(where i={1,2}) yields a sin( ϕγ−ϕS) = cos ϕγ
(when ϕS=π/2) dependence for the Sivers asymme-
try, which implies an overall [ −sin2(ϕγ−ϕS)] in Eq.(15).
For the case in which polarized hadron A↑moves along
the−ˆzaxis (i.e. for the processes BA↑→l+l−X), the

Through this azimuthal asymmetry, the Drell-Yan pro-
cess allows one to preferentially probe from the target and7
beam hadrons to create the quark anti-quark annihilation
process of interest resulting in a dimuon pair in the detec-
tor. SIDIS only permits the measurement of a convolu-
tion of the TMDs function with a fragmentation function,
whereas Drell-Yan allows the direct measurement of the
TMDs without the complications of fragmentation func-
tions and final state interactions. Coupled with its innate
sensitivity to sea quarks, Drell-Yan is a critical process
for determining the TMDs of the sea quarks.
III. FITTING Nq(x)
To obtain accurate three-dimensional tomographic in-
formation on quarks and gluons inside the nucleon, it
is critical to extract TMDs with minimal model depen-
dence and little to no unknown biases. Fitting with
statistical analysis tools such as MINUIT [46] rely on
χ2minimization or log-likelihood functions to compute
the best-fit parameter values and uncertainties, includ-
ing correlations between parameters. This class of algo-
rithms has well-established statistical methods that have
been used for decades in various scientific fields, making
them a reliable and trusted tool. In frequentist statistics,
the reliability of a χ2minimization fitting method can
be evaluated through the concept of hypothesis testing.
The fitting method minimizes the difference between the
observed data and the expected theoretical model, ex-
pressed through a χ2statistic. The χ2statistic follows
a known distribution and the probability of obtaining
a value as extreme as the observation can be directly
calculated. The reliability of the χ2minimization fit-
ting method depends greatly on the ability to accurately
estimate the theoretical uncertainties and the degree to
which the model approximates the observed data. When
these conditions are met, the method can provide a reli-
able estimate of the parameters that describe the model
and its uncertainties. However, chi-square fits can be sen-
sitive to the choice of initial parameter values and may
not always converge to the correct solution. Fitting with
DNNs can provide considerable advantages and does not
inherently sacrifice the statistical framework provided by
chi-square fits but it’s worth touching on some key at-
tributes needed in the method in order to best maintain
quality statistical relevance and interpretation of result-
ing fits.
To preserve the statistical robustness and reliability of
traditional χ2minimization fitting when using a DNN, it
is important to carefully consider the data quality, model
selection, validation, interpretation, and testing criteria.
The quality of the data used to train the DNN should be
as high as possible to ensure the DNN learns the correct
relationships between inputs and outputs. This is crucial
because the reliability of the DNN is only as good as the
quality of the data it is trained on. Quantifying differ-
ences between the training data and the real data used
in the fit can be challenging and can lead to unknown
biases and systematic errors. In the method used here,Monte Carlo data, which has been tuned and matched to
the experimental data, is utilized. This is done by succes-
sively extracting information from the experimental data
to impose into the generated Monte Carlo data and then
using the improved Monte Carlo data to further refine
the extraction technique.
The choice of DNN architecture, activation functions,
regularization techniques, and other hyperparameters
should be carefully selected to minimize over-fitting and
maximize generalization performance. Cross-validation
techniques can be used to tune these hyperparameters
and ensure the best possible fit to the data. The quality
of the fit should be quantified with a metric that is well-
defined and can be interpreted statistically. This could
still be the χ2statistic but may also be a variety of possi-
ble loss functions. The trained DNN should be validated
on an independent test dataset to ensure that it gener-
alizes well to new data and that it does not over-fit the
training data. This is critical because over-fitting can
lead to an unreliable and unstable model.
When interpreting the results of the DNN fit, it’s im-
portant to carefully examine the relationships between
the inputs and outputs. To better understand how
the DNN makes its predictions, techniques such as fea-
ture importance and attention mechanisms can be used.
While DNNs can have a reliable statistical interpreta-
tion, it requires a more detailed analysis than traditional
algorithms like MINUIT.
Directed testing of the model predictions and verifica-
tion of reliability through multiple trials is crucial. Stud-
ies to test accuracy and precision are useful along with
quantifying the robustness of the extraction method itself
once a DNN architecture has been chosen. In this regard,
it’s important to prove that the method can be flexible as
well as correct. It is not normally useful to have a model
and method that yields highly accurate results but only
for a fine slice of phase space under particular conditions.
The conventional chi-square minimization routines are
limited in their flexibility and applicability to more com-
plex problems because they assume a specific functional
form of the relationship between inputs and outputs. In
contrast, DNNs can learn complex and nonlinear rela-
tionships, making them suitable for tasks that require
some degree of abstraction and where there is no known
specific functional form of the relationship. DNNs are
proven to be universal approximators and can handle
large amounts of data while generalizing well to new data,
which improves their accuracy and robustness. This is es-
pecially helpful in the present application, where DNNs
can be used to build better models with new experimen-
tal data as it becomes available.
The ambiguity in the literature around Nq(x) and the
accompanying factorized terms in the Sivers function
(h(k⊥) and fq/N(x, k⊥;Q2)) makes it a good candidate
for a DNN extraction. In most Sivers function extrac-
tions [5, 8, 23, 25–27, 35, 47–51], Nq(x) differs either by
its parameterization or by the treatment of qinNq(x).
For example, in [7, 11, 26, 27], all anti-quarks (¯ u,¯d, and8
¯s) were treated the same (or combined) and referred to
as the ‘unbroken sea’.
Our first step is a generalization of the MINUIT fit pa-
rameterization of Nq(x) for all light quark flavors. Sec-
tion IV B summarizes the corresponding MINUIT fit re-
sults using iminuit (python version of MINUIT) [46]. In
these fits we use the same dataset as in [4], and obtained
the fit parameters for Nq(x) defined as,
Nq(x) =Nqxαq(1−x)βq(αq+βq)(αq+βq)
ααqqββqq. (27)
This expression is generalized for all light quark flavors,
where Nqis a scalar for quark flavor q. After our con-
sistency check, this parameterization is used as a pseu-
dodata generator to train and test the DNN model. We
emphasize that our original MINUIT fit parameterization
is used as a tool to demonstrate that the DNN model is
capable of predicting (or confirming) the 19-parameter
model used to generate pseudodata, as illustrated in Sec-
tion IV C. It should be clarified that we do not rely on
the form of Eq. (27) in any way and any function that
can be used to generate quality1pseudodata could be
used. After building confidence in the DNN model from
these preliminary tests, we move towards extracting the
Sivers functions from experimental data from the SIDIS
process with a polarized-proton target (see section IV D).
Previous work on global fits to SIDIS data considered the
data from polarized-proton targets, polarized-deuteron
targets, and polarized3He gas targets as a combined
dataset. This is usually motivated only by the overall lack
of separate polarized target data. In [7], isospin symme-
try was assumed for f⊥
1T,uandf⊥
1T,dfor COMPASS2009
[52] and COMPASS2017 [53] datasets. However, these
are very different polarized targets with very different
results so we explore if our method will be sensitive to
flavor and target dependence by fitting each polarized
target data independently. As the nuclear effects on the
Sivers functions are not very well understood, separately
extracting the same observable with different types of
polarized targets that contain different flavor dominance
and different nuclear effects could provide valuable in-
sight. Significant data would be required for each target
type so there are clear limitations at the moment and our
fits can only be considered preliminary in this regard.
The DNN’s unique capacity to manage abstraction al-
lows for the capture of additional complexity in a semi-
model-independent way. To obtain the most information
from the data and fit results we attempt to decompose
some of this abstraction using the following conditions,
•DNN fits to SIDIS data from proton and deuteron
targets are performed independently to obtain sep-
arate models.
1The term quality here refers to how well it can represent the real
experimental data.•No kinematic cuts are applied to take full advan-
tage of the available data and to allow the DNN to
build implicit inclusion of the necessary corrections
related to TMD factorization.
•A Sivers function for each light-quark flavor is ob-
tained to ensure the SU(3)flavor breaking effects in
QCD are also contained.
The technique to achieve the extraction under the afore-
mentioned conditions is somewhat novel, so explicit de-
tails are provided step by step for clarity in the next
section.

IV. THE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE
The factorized form, Nq(x)h(k⊥)fq/N(x, k⊥) assumes
the validity of Eq. (4), leading to model dependencies
associated with this assertion and the Gaussian inter-
pretation for the k⊥distributions of the partons. This
introduces a bias to the analysis, but it is a known bias
and can be managed. Within the construction of a DNN
model in the fit function,
NDNN
q(x)h(k⊥)fq/N(x, k⊥), (28)
there could be considerable variation in definitions (or
assumptions) of h(k⊥) orfq/N(x, k⊥) still leading to a
quality fit of NDNN
q(x) to the data due to its consider-
able flexibility and high number of parameters with re-
spect to either of the other two terms in the function.
This makes the final NDNN
q(x) highly dependent on the
choice of h(k⊥) and fq/N(x, k⊥) so the resulting NDNN
q(x)
model must always be used with the same definitions of
h(k⊥) and fq/N(x, k⊥) it was trained with. However, no
particular definition of h(k⊥) orfq/N(x, k⊥) is required to9
make the combination of NDNN
q(x)h(k⊥)fq/N(x, k⊥) non-
biased and perform well in the fit. From this standpoint,
we do not consider this to be a fully model-independent
extraction, but every attempt is made to make it mini-
mally model-dependent while still preserving the original
assumptions relevant to the phenomenology for trans-
parency of the schema. The DNN treatment of Nq(x)
enables the flexibility of handling all the light quark-
flavors q={u,¯u, d, ¯d, s,¯s}independently. The method
presented is intended to be somewhat analogous to the
approach of treating Nq(x) as a fit function to be param-
eterized for the sake of illustrating the advantages. It is
natural to extend this study towards a symbolic regres-
sion of Nq(x) or the full expression of the Sivers function
but that is not the scope of the present work.

FIG. 5. The block-diagram for DY Sivers asymmetries (see
Eq. (22)). Nqdenotes the DNN models for each quark-
flavor q={u, d, s, ¯u,¯d,¯s}obtained by training to SIDIS Sivers
asymmetries.
We use a relationship for Nq(x), similar to the seminal
work [4], as a tool to generate our pseudodata for test-
ing accuracy and reproducibility only. This definition is
not used in any aspect of the final DNN fit results. The
generic feedforward DNN structure for Nq(x) that we use
in this work is represented in Fig. 3. As we consider the
SU(3)flavor symmetry breaking in QCD, we have Nu(x),
N¯u(x),Nd(x),N¯d(x),Ns(x), and N¯s(x) to handle the six
light-quark-flavors independently. Bjorken- xis the only
input as the initial layer of each Nq(x), and the final
layer is a single-node output. The m1inA0(z, phT, m 1)
as defined in Eq. (9) is treated as a free parameter, with
the initialization obtained from our first chi-square mini-
mization fit (discussed in Section IV B), and then allowed
to vary throughout the DNN training process with SIDIS
data, as shown in Fig. 4. The DNN model results arethen used to infer the projections for both SIDIS kine-
matics and DY kinematics (see Fig. 5).
There are many open-source software libraries for ma-
chine learning and artificial intelligence. For this partic-
ular extraction, we use TensorFlow [54]. A deep feed-
forward architecture is used with the hidden layers ex-
panded with multiple numbers of nodes which are initial-
ized randomly with Gaussian sampling of weights around
zero with a standard deviation of 0 .1. The degree of po-
tential Non-linearity is introduced into the network by
the choice of the activation function. The selection of
the activation function can have a substantial impact on
DNN performance and training dynamics. We chose the
Relu6 activation function. This activation is a variant of
the Rectified Linear Unit ( ReLU ) function. The ReLU 6
activation function has been shown to empirically per-
form better under low-precision conditions by encourag-
ing the model to learn sparse features earlier, which is
beneficial for learning complex patterns and relationships
from the experimental data. We also use Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression which is a
regularization technique used to prevent overfitting and
improve the model’s performance and generalization abil-
ity, while also encouraging sparsity and feature selection.
We also use L1 regularization. L1 regularization encour-
ages sparsity in the activation by adding a penalty term
to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute
value of the weights [55]. By adding this regularization
term, the most important inputs are weighted the most,
so that noisy or redundant information is discarded. The
strength of the regularization is controlled by the mag-
nitude of the regularization coefficient, which is set to
10−12. Additionally, we use a dynamically decreasing
learning rate. The learning rate is automatically reduced
by 10% if the training loss has not decreased within the
last 200 epochs2(i.e. patience = 200). The optimizer
used was Adam while the loss function used was Mean
Squared Error . During the hyperparameter optimization
process, there were slight deviations in the number of
layers, nodes per layer, initial learning rate, batch size,
and the number of epochs, but the basics of the scheme
just described remain consistent for all DNNs used.
Data shuffling is used to randomly organize the data
into batches that pass through the training process.
When training, it is crucial to expose the DNN to a di-
verse range of training samples. Shuffling the training
data ensures that the DNN doesn’t learn patterns based
on the sequential order of data. Instead, it promotes a
more randomized and representative distribution of the
data, preventing the model from becoming biased toward
any specific subset or order. This randomization helps
the model generalize better and makes it more robust
to variations in the input data, ultimately improving its
2An epoch is a complete cycle of the passing of training data

overall performance and accuracy. Batch size is a crit-
ical component of successful training as well. A batch
size too large for a small data set, even well-shuffled, can
also lead to a biased model. In what follows, we train
two dedicated DNN models: one for the SIDIS data with
a polarized proton target and one for the data with a
polarized deuteron (neutron) target. Since the number
of available data points for the deuteron target is signif-
icantly smaller than the amount of data for the proton
target, care is taken to find the optimum configuration of
shuffling and batch size for the case of deuteron whereas
for the proton the shuffling and batch size’s impact is
nearly negligible.
Our strategy is to first perform an exercise using only
pseudodata to verify the extraction method that will ul-
timately be used on the real experimental data. First, we
devise a generating function for the SIDIS Sivers asym-
metry data using a conventional χ2-minimization routine
(MINUIT in this case), without following the popular as-
sumption of “unbroken sea” [4] in order to generalize the
treatment of quarks and antiquarks. We perform a series
of conventional MINUIT fits step-wise to obtain the final
19 parameters for the case of broken SU(3)flavor symme-
try in QCD. Then, we produce pseudodata (or replicas)
for the SIDIS asymmetry by sampling from the mock
experimental errors using the generating function with
kinematics and binning in x,zandphTas in the exper-
imental data. Then a DNN model is constructed with
all hyperparameters tuned in order to achieve the high-
est possible accuracy and precision. Here our nomencla-
ture becomes quite specific and we refer to the result-
ing distribution of DNN fits as a DNN model . The first
model obtained with the method for a particular set of
data is referred to as the First Iteration . At this stage,
we use the distribution of fit results to obtain the mean
and the error band from the initial DNN model to re-
parameterize the generating function so that it produces
more realistic pseudodata. The DNN fits are performed
again improving the quality (both accuracy and preci-
sion) of the resulting fits to result in a Second Iteration
DNN model. One can repeat the number of iterations
until the resulting model is no longer improving within
the experimental uncertainties. In this way, the DNN
model approaches the best approximation of the Sivers
functions in comparison to the true values put into the
generating function .
After confirming that the method works well, an ex-
traction of the Sivers function using the SIDIS experi-
mental data is performed. We treat the data for a po-
larized proton-target and deuteron-target separately for
two reasons. First, fitting these together would intro-
duce bias that would need to be managed directly. This
is the case even assuming isospin symmetry in the uand
d-quarks’ Sivers functions. Second, our approach leaves
open the possibility to explore the nuclear dependence of
the Sivers functions. The construction of the DNN mod-
els for proton and deuteron is analogous. To perform the
fit another First Iteration , as previously described, isperformed by developing and tuning a DNN model using
the data from the real experiment rather than pseudo-
data from the generating function. In the proceeding it-
erations, we use the generating function in order to tune
the hyperparameters to achieve the highest possible qual-
ity of fit in comparison with the results from the First
Iteration . Once a tuned model is obtained, we perform
an extended study for evaluating the algorithmic uncer-
tainty3as well as the systematic uncertainty of the DNN
extraction method.
To elaborate on the pedagogy of this method, we or-
ganize the remainder of this section into the following
subsections: (IV A) Data selection, (IV B) MINUIT fits
for the case of SU(3)flavor, (IV C) DNN model training
with pseudodata, (IV D) DNN model training with real
experimental data.
A. Data selection
Generally, TMD factorization is considered valid only
under the kinematics restriction of Λ ≪Q, and phT≪
zQ. The first of these requirements is important because
it is only in this limit one can apply massless-hadron kine-
matics resulting in near-negligible contamination from
power corrections work where Q > 2GeV is common.
The second of these requirements provides the kinematic
range a traditional factorization scheme will work. Ad-
ditionally, the transverse mass scale should generally be
preserved around ( m/Q/z )2. We do not strictly adhere
to any of these guidelines but instead, study the conse-
quence of using progressively less restrictive cuts. For
global data selection, we focus our attention on the fixed
target SIDIS and DY data. For the proton DNN fits,
kinematically 3D binned data from HERMES2020 [56]
is left out for validation and only used 1D binned HER-
MES2020 data for the training. For the neutron DNN
fits, the polarized3He data from Jefferson Lab [57, 58] is
left out and used to test the new projections of the DNN
model trained on the deuteron COMPASS data only.
Table I summarizes the kinematic coverage, the num-
ber of data points, and reaction types of the datasets
that are considered in this work. In addition to the
SIDIS datasets that are used in the fits, the polarized
DY dataset from the COMPASS experiment is also listed
in Table I as we demonstrate the predictive capability of
the DNN model by comparing the projections with the
real data points. The DY projections are made using
the trained SIDIS DNN model assuming a sign change
expected from conditional universality. For the case
of training the DNN model related to proton-target we
use HERMES2009 [59], COMPASS2015 [60] and HER-
MES2020 [56] data points associated with 1D kinematic

bution of the resulting fits that is not directly from propagated

binning, leaving the HEREMES2020[56] data associated
with the 3D kinematic binning to compare with the pro-
jections from the trained model. The COMPASS2009
[52] dataset with a polarized-deuteron target is used for
the neutron Sivers extraction as a separate DNN model.

TABLE I. The SIDIS and DY datasets considered in the fits
include the DY data, which is used to demonstrate the pre-
dictive capability of the DNN model. Specifically, we make
projections using the trained SIDIS DNN model, assuming a
sign change to predict the real experimental DY data points.
For the HERMES2020 dataset, data is available with both 1D
and 3D kinematic bins. The 3D bin numbers are indicated in
bold font.
For the initial χ2-minimization fit with MINUIT the
same datasets are used as in [4] for consistency which
is HERMES2009 [59], COMPASS2009 [52], and COM-
PASS2015 [60]. This fit is described in the next subsec-
tion. The error in Fit 1 of Table II is quite large and
many of the parameters are consistent with zero. This
highlights the challenges of reproducing this type of an-
alytical fit with a standard χ2minimization fit. The last
column, Fit 5, is a fit from our generating function to the
proton-DNN model which provides the most accurate pa-
rameterization of Nqto date. Again, we point out we do
not use this parameterization for any physics extraction
but only to generate pseudodata.B. MINUIT fits for SU(3)flavor
The analysis begins with a χ2-minimization fit with
MINUIT similar to the approach in [4] except we expand
the number of parameters to treat each of the light-quark
flavors separately. The results of the MINUIT fits are
shown in Table II. Fit 1 is from the original fit results
from Anselmino et al directly from [4]. Here the Nq(x)
for the uanddquark used is Eq. (27) but N¯q(x) =N¯q
for anti-quarks. In this fit, there are three parameters αq
andβqandNqfor each quark flavor, and for each anti-
quark it’s just N¯qplusm1. This results in a 9-parameter
fit. Fit 2 is a test to reproduce the same parameteri-
zation as in Fit 1. We note that in Fit 2 non of the
9 parameters are fixed or have bounds imposed. Both
of these first columns only consider uanddquarks and
antiquarks. The Fit 1 parameters were used as the ini-
tial values to perform Fit 2. The difference in these two
sets of fit parameters demonstrates the challenge of sys-
tematic consistency with this method though some pa-
rameters match reasonably well. For fit 3 we use the
same convention but add in the strange quark so there is
an additional four parameters Ns,αs,βs, and N¯swhich
leads to a 13-parameter fit. In order to initialize the 13
parameters in Fit 3, we use the corresponding values for
those parameters from Fit 2 and zeros for the rest. Fit
4 uses Eq. (27) for both quarks and antiquarks so that
the treatment of all three light-quark-flavors is the same.
In addition to the parameters from Fit 3, Fit 4 contains
six more parameters for the antiquarks. The result of
Fit 4 leads to a larger N¯qvalue to compensate for the
fact that α¯sandβ¯sare now present in the fit. However,
the motivation behind performing Fit 4 in this way is to
generalize the Nq(x) in a flavor-independent fashion for
both quarks and anti-quarks. Fit 4 is the final fit that
we will use to generate pseudodata for testing the DNN
fits and for calculating the model’s accuracy. The last
column, Fit 5, uses the analytical generating function to
fit the proton-DNN model in fine bins. The error of the
model is propagated to each bin and a MINUIT fit is
performed providing a highly accurate parameterization
ofNqrepresented in this particular function form. We
provide this can as a basis for comparison.
C. DNN Method Testing
We develop a systematic method of constructing, opti-
mizing, and testing the DNN fits by using pseudodata to
ensure a quality extraction from the experimental data.
Our approach uses a combination of Monte Carlo sam-
pling and synthetic data generation. The pseudodata
points are randomly generated by sampling within multi-
Gaussian distributions centered around each experimen-
tal data point, with variance given by the experimental
uncertainty. Many pseudodata DNN fits (instances) are
performed together to obtain the uncertainty of the re-
sulting DNN model (mean and distribution). The general12

approach is to use existing experimental data to parame-
terize a fit function and then use it to generate new syn-
thetic data (replicas) with similar characteristics. The
pseudodata is generated with a known Sivers function
so that the extraction technique can be explicitly tested.
An error bar is assigned to each new data point which
is taken directly from the experimental uncertainties re-
ported for the complete set of kinematic bins. This ap-
proach aims to produce pseudodata that simulates the
experimental data as closely as possible with particular
sensitivity to phase space. It does this so that the test
metrics are also relevant for the real experimental extrac-
tion. To do this the pseudodata generator must be very
well-tuned to the kinematic range of the experimental
data. Hence, the generating function contains as muchfeature space information as possible. It’s important to
emphasize here that the metrics that we use to quantify
the improvement in the Second Iteration compared to
theFirst Iteration are sensitive to phase space. The
accuracy (proximity of the mean of the DNN fits to the
true Sivers) is defined as,
ϵq(x, k⊥) =

Thegenerating-function used to produce the truevalue
of the Sivers is improved in the process of optimizing
the DNN hyperparameters. This approach improves the
generating-function and the DNN fit with each iteration.
As a result, more realistic data can be generated in each
iteration, which enables better hyperparameter optimiza-
tion and testing for the experimental data in the subse-
quent iteration. Note that experimental data still refers
to pseudodata replicas that are generated using the real
experimental data rather than the generating-function .
In the pseudodata test, the same number of replicas
are used in the First Iteration and in the Second It-
eration . The number of replicas should be kept the
same across consecutive iterations to control statistical
error variation from the replicas. To most accurately
propagate the experimental uncertainty using the replica
approach requires a sufficient amount of replicas so that
only negligible statistical error from the replicas is added.
For the present study, our pseudodata uncertainty is sim-
plified and is represented by a single error bar which con-
tains the experimental statistical error and systematic
error provided by the data publication.4
These are the steps to perform the DNN Method Test-
ingwith pseudodata using the generating function
1. Generate pseudodata for the SIDIS Sivers asymme-
try using the generating function (The initial func-
tion used is from Fit 4 in Table II).
2.First Iteration : construct a DNN fit and tune its
hyperparameters by training with the pseudodata
from Step 1. Use 10% of the pseudodata for the
validation in each epoch.
3. Determine the optimum number of epochs by an-
alyzing the training and validation losses for each
replica in Step 2.
4A more detailed analysis could be performed if a full covariance
matrix from the experimental analysis was provided but this type
of information is often difficult to obtain after the experiment
results are published.13
4. Improve the generating function :
(a) Perform an intermediate DNN fit to the ex-
perimental data. This fit is performed us-
ing the optimized hyperparameters from the
above Steps 2 and 3.
(b) Use the trained DNN fit from (a) to infer the
asymmetry over the 3D kinematics ( x, z, p hT)
in fine bins.5
(c) Perform a MINUIT fit on the fine-binned data
to obtain the new generating function param-
eterization.
5. Perform Step 1 again using the improved generating
function .
6.Second Iteration : Perform Step 2 again with the
pseudodata generated from Step 5.
7. Perform a comparison of the Sivers functions ex-
tracted at the First Iteration vsSecond Iter-
ation in terms of the accuracy ,precision and the
magnitude of the loss-function at the final epoch.
The accuracy metric is a critical part of the testing
and is used to understand the resulting extraction meth-
ods’ strengths and weaknesses. A truly robust method
would be consistently able to make accurate predictions
for any generating function parameterization over the rel-
evant kinematic range. To verify the robustness of our
extraction method, we test it with many artificial Sivers
functions and their corresponding pseudodata at the final
stage.
The hyperparameters optimization process is a system-
atic process of trial and error with architecture changes
like adding or subtracting layers and the number of nodes
per layer. The initial learning rate varies as does the
batch size. Care is taken to achieve the lowest train-
ing and validation loss. We monitor the stability of the
loss by examining the magnitude and frequency of fluc-
tuations. A more moderate and even trend downward
is optimal. After the generating function is improved,
in principle, it holds more information. The number of
layers and nodes is increased to make a better fit to the
new, more realistic, pseudodata in the Second Iteration .
If there are too few hidden layers and nodes, it becomes
apparent when the training loss does not decrease com-
pared to previous fits. Too many additional layers and
nodes result in instability in the training loss. Tuning
continues until little improvement in accuracy and preci-
sion can be determined.
Figure (6) illustrates the results from the First Iter-
ation (two plots on the left-hand side ) and the Second

try data for a given kinematic variable, the averaged values are

point where it is difficult to distinguish the solid line and
the corresponding dashed line, indicating a high degree of
accuracy and precision. Also, we observed that the train-
ing loss in the Second Iteration is about one order of
magnitude less than the one from the First Iteration .
D. DNN model from real data
In contrast to the testing of the DNN model with pseu-
dodata from the generating function , we now describe
the steps to apply the DNN fit method to real exper-
imental data. The pseudodata test from Sec. IV C is
using the combined proton and deuteron data as in all
previous work on global fits of the Sivers function. In
the following extraction with real experimental data, the
proton and deuteron data are fitted separately. To take
full advantage of the information provided by the model
testing in the previous section, the steps from Sec. IV C
are performed again separately for proton and deuteron
data. The starting hyperparameters for the first DNN fit
in this section including the architecture, initial learning
rate, batch size, as well as optimal number of epochs,
are all determined based on the best accuracy and pre-
cision using the well-tuned pseudodata from the gener-
ating function first in each case. The provide more in-
formation on the initial hyperparameter so that even theFirst Iteration is a quality fit. In the following steps,
two distinct DNN models are developed, one for the pro-
tonquarks Sivers asymmetry and one for neutron quark
Sivers asymmetry. The following procedure is common
to both.
1.First Iteration : construct a DNN fit and tune its
hyperparameters by training with the experimental
data. Use 10% of the data for the validation in each
epoch.6
2. Identify the optimum number of epochs when the
validation loss exceeds the training loss (see Fig.
(8) as an example).
3. Perform a DNN fit, with the optimized hyperpa-
rameters from Step 1 and the number of epochs
determined from Step 2, using all the data without
leaving any for validation.
4. Improve the generating function :
(a) Use the tuned DNN model in step 3 to in-
fer the asymmetry over the 3D kinematics
(x, z, p hT) in fine bins.
(b) Perform a MINUIT fit to obtain the new gen-
erating function .
(c) Produce pseudodata for the SIDIS asymmetry
using the generating function in the previous
step.
5. Perform Step 1 and Step 2 with the pseudodata
from Step 4 (from the improved generating func-
tion).
6.Second Iteration : perform a DNN fit with the
optimized hyperparameters from Step 5 using ex-
perimental data without leaving any data for vali-
dation.
7. Perform a comparison of the Sivers functions ex-
tracted at the First Iteration vsSecond Iter-
ation in terms of the accuracy ,precision and the
magnitude of the loss-function at the final epoch.
Although the architectural specifics such as the num-
ber of hidden layers, nodes per layer, and learning rate
may be modified in the hyperparameter optimization
step, the number of epochs and the number of replicas
remain the same. The overall feedforward architecture
structure remains consistent as well for simplicity. Table

rations are represented with C{i,f}

experimental data has already been fit to improve the generating
function for the pseudodata test. With every subsequent itera-
tion, the pseudodata test and the DNN fit to the experimental
data improve.15

Clearly, the pseudodata from the generating function
still plays a critical role in the tuning and testing of the fit
of the real experimental data. Accuracy is necessarily de-
termined using pseudodata so that the mean of the final
DNN model can be compared directly to the true Sivers
asymmetry. This procedure for determining accuracy as-
sumes that the true Sivers asymmetry from the experi-ment can be approximated by the well-tuned generating
function after the final iteration. There is a systematic
error associated with analyzing accuracy this way but
this type of error can be estimated.
After completing the extraction method described
above, we perform a systematic uncertainty assessment
on the overall method of extraction. To test the relia-
bility of the extraction, we adjust the parameters of the
generating function and repeat the extraction process by
again following the full set of steps for several variations
of pseudodata. By using the Sivers asymmetry generated
from the optimized generating function , the absolute dif-
ferences between the mean of the DNN model and the
true value over k⊥was used to estimate the systematic
uncertainties of the final DNN model from this extraction
technique.
V. RESULTS
In this section, we present the results from two separate
DNN models: the proton -DNN and the deuteron -DNN,
along with their optimized hyperparameters. The num-
ber of parameters in the optimized proton-DNN model is
11 million wheras for deuteron-DNN model is 2.8 million.
Only SIDIS data was used to train the DNN models in
this exploratory AI-based extraction technique. The op-
timized hyperparameter configurations are provided for
both models in columns Ci(f)
pandCi(f)
d, with the sub-
scripts pandd, respectively, in Table III. To quantita-
tively represent the improvement made by performing the
steps mentioned in the previous section, we present our
accuracy and precision results in the lower part of Table
III.
A. DNN fit to SIDIS data
We now explore the results and compare some of our
final fits and projections with those of other global fits.
Note that the χ2values are calculated values for each
kinematic bin based on Pearson’s reduced χ2statistic,
and indicated in our plots are calculated after the analysis
is complete, rather than as a part of the minimization
process.
The plots of SIDIS Sivers asymmetry data and our re-
sulting DNN models (for proton anddeuteron ) are shown
in Fig. 9. Each plot includes the partial χ2values for
the particular x, z, and phTbins for each hadron type.
HERMES2009 [59] ( top-left ), HERMES2020 [56] ( top-
right), and COMPASS 2015 [60] ( bottom-left ) are de-
scribed with the proton -DNN model with Root-Mean-
Square-Error (RMSE) of 0.0225, whereas the COM-
PASS2009 [52] ( bottom-right ) dataset is described with
thedeuteron -DNN with RMSE of 0.0220. In comparison
with [4], there are some improvements in describing the
proton SIDIS data on π±andK+in HERMES 2009,
which can be noticed quantitatively based on the partial16

FIG. 9. The DNN fit results of the SIDIS Sivers asymmetries (red) accompanied by 68% CL error bands in comparison with the
actual data (blue). The proton -DNN model is trained with HERMES2009, HERMES2020, and COMPASS2015, whereas the
deuteron -DNN model is trained with the COMPASS2009 data. The calculated partial χ2values are provided as quantitative
assessments for all kinematic bins.17
χ2values from the DNN model. This indicates that the
possible effects attributed to the TMD evolution [6, 8, 48]
and were assumed to be the cause of the larger χ2values
in [4] for proton data on π+may have been somewhat in-
tegrated into the DNN model. Although HERMES 2020
[56] reported SIDIS data in 1D kinematic bins as well as
with 3D kinematic bins, in our fits we use the data in the
form of 1D kinematic bins to be consistent with the rest
of the datasets in our fits.
The deuteron -DNN model’s description of COM-
PASS2009 [52] data is shown in the bottom-left sub-figure
of Fig. 9. Without applying any cuts on the data, the
DNN model yields a RMSE of 0.0220, covering the full
range in x,z, and phTkinematic projections from the
COMPASS2009 dataset. This is in contrast to the lim-
ited kinematic coverage considered in [5, 7, 9, 51]; no-
tably, the data points at phT>1 GeV are described
somewhat better by the deuteron -DNN model compare
to the fits in [4, 26]. This suggests that performing ded-
icated fits to data specific to polarized nucleon targets
enables better information extraction, which is true for
both DNN and other fitting approaches. The advantage
of DNNs in this case is to perform well even with limited
data.
We did not include JLab [57, 58] data in our deuteron -
DNN model fits to use it as a projection test for the neu-
tron Sivers asymmetry. Our projection indicates good
agreement with the3He data, but both the data and
the projection are largely consistent with zero. It is also
important to note that in this work we are notimpos-
ing any isospin symmetry condition ( f⊥u
1T=f⊥d
1Tand/or
f⊥¯u
1T=f⊥¯d
1T) for the SIDIS data with the deuteron target
as was done in [7]. The successful construction of the
two different proton and neutron Sivers functions may
indicate that our DNN approach can be particularly use-
ful for analyzing data from polarized nucleons in different
nuclei, potentially opening up a new way of exploring the
nuclear effects associated with TMDs.
B. Sivers in Momentum Space
The extracted Sivers functions, including the system-
atic uncertainties from the DNN models at x= 0.1 and
Q2= 2.4 GeV, are shown in Fig. 10 represented by the
mean with 68% Confidence Level (CL) error-bands . The
corresponding optimized hyperparameter configurations
for the proton -DNN model and deuteron -DNN model are
Cf
pandCf
d, respectively, as given in Table III. The Sivers
functions extracted using the deuteron -DNN model show
consistency with zero, considering the accompanying sys-
tematic uncertainties. However, this is still a significant
result, given the limitation in statistics from the SIDIS
data with a deuteron target. The Sivers functions ex-
tracted using the proton -DNN model have small system-
atic uncertainties. Note that we use ∆Nfq/p↑(x, k⊥) no-
tation, as in [4], to represent the Sivers functions in our
plots, and one can use Eq. (3) to convert to f⊥q

Comparing the extracted Sivers functions in k⊥-space
to other extractions in the literature can also be useful,
although we have not included those curves in our plots.
In summary, the proton -DNN model extractions are rel-
atively precise, with narrower error bands compared to
those in [3, 4, 7–9, 11, 26].

quarks from the proton -DNN model represented in upper
(lower) half of the figure; with the results from: PV22 [51],
JAM20 [5], EIKV [8], TC18 [61].
DNN models are given in Fig. 11 with 68% CL error-
bands using the optimized hyperparameter configurationsC2 andC3 in Table III respectively for proton -DNN model
anddeuteron -DNN model. The calculated moments us-
ing the deuteron -DNN model are consistent with zero,
based on the systematic uncertainties.
Comparing the results in Fig. 1 of [51] as shown in Fig.
12, we see that the xf⊥(1)u
1T from the DNN model is more
consistent with [5, 8] in the vicinity of x= 0.1, although
it is consistent with [27] at x= 0.01. The xf⊥(1)d
1T, in
general, is consistent with the extractions from [4, 5, 8,
26, 27, 51, 61]. Additionally, the extracted behavior of
xf⊥(1)u
1T andxf⊥(1)d
1T is consistent with the qualitative
observation in [26],

orf⊥(1)u

which was originally a prediction from the large- Nclimit
of QCD [62]. Most importantly, the DNN model is able
to capture the feature of the uanddquarks orbiting
in opposite directions without imposing this constraint
directly as done in [45]. In terms of the quantitative
assessment, Eq. (32) could be accurate at the large- Nc
limit, if the isospin breaking effects are also included at
the next to leading order in O(1/Nc).
In regards to the light sea-quarks, the proton -DNN
model extracts the features such as ∆Nf(1)
¯u/p↑(x)>0 and
∆Nf(1)
¯d/p↑(x)<0, even considering the scale of the uncer-
tainties. Additionally, the proton -DNN model is consis-
tent with
∆Nf(1)
¯u/p↑(x) =−∆Nf(1)
¯d/p↑(x) (33)
which was also a similar observation from a theoretical
calculation based on SU(2) chiral Lagrangian [63] and
the predictions at large- Nclimit of QCD [62]. The cen-
tral values extracted in [27] are qualitatively similar to
the features seen in Fig. 11 which are small but non-zero
within the uncertainties. Additionally, the correspond-
ing central values extracted in [4] are both negative but
consistent with zero.
The first transverse moments xf⊥(1)q
1T(x), in the case
ofSU(3)flavor , from our DNN result, are more precise
(narrower error bands) than those in [4, 23, 26]. However,
the error bands are slightly larger than those in JAM20
[5], which includes more data from SIDIS, DY and SIA,
pp-collisions, and parameterizations for Sivers, Collins,
and Transversity TMDs together.

are accompanied by 68% CL error bands. We also pro-
vide calculated partial χ2values for each kinematic bin
as a quantitative assessment. Unlike in [7], we have made
projections for all the data points since we have not ap-
plied any data cuts. There are relatively larger partial
χ2/Npt(as was also observed in [7]), but only in a couple
ofK+andK−bins. In Fig. 14, we present the pro-jected SIDIS Sivers asymmetries for the JLab kinematics
[57, 58], obtained using our deuteron -DNN model. The
figure includes 68% CL error bands and a comparison
with the JLab neutron Sivers asymmetry data. These
results are consistent with those reported in [4, 8, 9, 61].20

2. DY Projections
The resulting DNN model based on the SIDIS Sivers
asymmetries is capable of projecting the Sivers asymme-
tries in DY experiments which could be sensitive to either
valence quarks or sea quarks depending on the relevant
kinematic coverage. For example, the COMPASS2017-
polarized DY Sivers asymmetry measurements [53] are
dominated by the valence quarks, and the upcoming
SpinQuest (E1039) experiment’s polarized DY asymme-
try measurements [64] will be dominated by the sea
quarks. For these DY projections, we follow the block di-
agram represented in Fig. 5, which includes the assump-
tion of the sign-change of the Sivers function in DY rel-
ative to the SIDIS process mentioned in Eq. (1). There-
fore, using the trained proton -DNN model, we make pro-
jections for the DY Sivers asymmetries for the COM-
PASS2017 experiment [53] with a proton target and a
pion beam using CTEQ6l [36] and JAM21PionPDFnlo
[65] for proton PDFs and pion PDFs respectively. Mean-
while, using both the proton -DNN model and deuteron -
DNN model, we make predictions for the SpinQuest ex-
periment7. The kinematic-inputs are x1(beam), x2(tar-
get), xF(=x1−x2),qT(transverse component of the
virtual photon), and QM(di-lepton invariant mass).
The projected DY Sivers asymmetries for the COM-
PASS2017 kinematics using the trained proton -DNN
model in comparison with the data [53] points are rep-
resented in the Fig. 15. Although the projections are
7The kinematic bins from the SeaQuest experiment are used [66].based on the assumption of conditional universality, it
is worth noting that without this assumption, negative
asymmetry projections were observed. However, for clar-
ity, the projections without assuming conditional univer-
sality are not shown in Fig. 15. When comparing the pro-
jections of the proton -DNN model with the predictions
from [4, 8, 49], it is evident that the mean of the pro-
ton-DNN model projection, in terms of xF, is more con-
sistent with the measured mean Sivers asymmetry in the
experiment (refer to Figure 6 in [53]). At the same time,
theproton -DNN model projection has relatively smaller
uncertainty. It is important to note that the predictions
mentioned in the cited works were based on different Q2−
evolution schemes, while the proton -DNN model incorpo-
rates DGLAP evolution through LHAPDF [37]. In [7],
only two data points from the COMPASS2017 [53] data
were included in their fits, resulting in larger uncertain-
ties in the projected asymmetry values for the remaining
data points when compared to the projections generated
by the proton -DNN model. The increasing trend of the
projected DY Sivers asymmetries with respect to the qT
kinematic variable in [7] is consistent with the projections
presented in the middle-right plot of Fig. 15 generated
by the proton -DNN model, while in [9], the correspond-
ing trend exhibits a very small negative slope in relation
toqT.
A non-zero sea-quark Sivers asymmetry is inferring
that the sea quarks have non-zero orbital angular mo-
mentum. The proton -DNN model predictions exhibit
consistency with the non-zero Sivers asymmetry from
thesea-quarks, with higher precision compared to ex-
isting predictions [4, 8, 49], for the SpinQuest kinematics
[64, 67]. Additionally, in this work, we report our projec-
tions for the polarized Drell-Yan Sivers asymmetries for a
deuteron target at the SpinQuest experiment, as shown
in Figure 16 by the orange-colored bands. The central
lines in all kinematic projections of x1, x2, xF, and qT, yet
consistent with zero. The proton -DNN model predicts a
positive slope with respect to qTfor a proton target as
shown in the lower-right plot of Fig. 16. To date, with
the exception of this work, no predictions have been made
for the polarized DY Sivers asymmetry using a deuteron
target, which will be measured during the SpinQuest ex-
periment. A noteworthy aspect of the forthcoming Spin-
Quest experiment is that, in addition to measuring the
Sivers asymmetry from proton anddeuteron targets, it
will also ascertain the transversity distributions of both
quarks and gluons, utilizing a tensor-polarized deuteron
Spin 1 target, as proposed in [68].
VI. SYSTEMATIC STUDIES
Using deep neural networks (DNNs) in global fits fol-
lowing a similar schema as laid out in this work may af-
ford the loosening of some of the strict kinematic cuts to
the experimental data while still preserving the validity
of TMD factorization. The methodology is still very new,21

but some distinct advantages are clear with our DNN ap-
proach compared to standard analytical fitting.
A. Systematic Study of Data Cuts
Neural networks, especially deep neural networks, have
a profound capacity for learning complex patterns and
relationships in data to model non-linear and high-
dimensional functions without any prior information on
the function dimensionality or form. When performing
global fits the kinematic dependencies can be intricate
and difficult to capture using conventional analytical ap-
proaches leading to the need to limit the data to achieve a
decent fit. DNNs can adapt to these complexities and, in
some cases, benefit from the lack of kinematic cuts, mak-
ing the resulting model more robust and still sensitive to
a range of kinematic variables.

For preserving the validity of TMD factorization nor-
mally strict kinematic cuts are applied. However, apply-
ing stringent cuts to already limited experimental data
reduces the statistical significance of the model and may
lead to the loss of valuable information. We explore a
range of possible cuts with the intention of preserving
as much data as possible and taking care to not intro-
duce bias by only selecting data that leads to better fits.
The unique feature of DNNs to perform well even when
trained on a broader range of data with complex cor-
relations serves as a major advantage over fitting ana-
lytically. It then serves, whenever there is not a direct
conflict with the necessary factorization theorem, to in-
clude data points from regions that might otherwise be
excluded in traditional kinematic cuts allowing the DNN
model to build implicit inclusion of the necessary correc-
tions.
DNNs have the ability to implicitly capture higher-22
order effects that would be near impossible to obtain us-
ing a direct analytical fit unless the initial ansatz is very
lucky or the function form has been proven to contain
the necessary physics. TMD factorization relies on spe-
cific assumptions about the dominance of certain terms
in the cross-section calculation. One critical limitation is
qhT≪Qwhich is required for the derivation of the fac-
torization property suitable for the case of relatively low
transverse momentum. In this factorization scheme ap-
proximations are made that have errors of order ( qhT/Q).
ForqhTgreater than Q, the conventional formalism, with
integrated fragmentation functions, would no longer be
valid. This directly leads to the restriction of SIDIS
data to a region where phT≪zQ, which can severely
reduce the available data. TMD factorization loses ac-
curacy at large qhT, with fractional errors characterized
as (qhT/Q)α. The Collins and Soper approach [16] gives
(m/Q ) errors for the full range of qhTwhich treats the
TMD term as a first approximation to the cross-section
and allows for the application of a correction by apply-
ing an additive approximation from the ordinary collinear
factorization. Such corrections can be implicitly captured
when training a DNN model over the full range of phT.
This is the case even if the assumptions such corrections
are based on are not relevant in all kinematic regions of
the applicable data. The only requirement is that TMD
factorization does not break down at a rigid boundary
but instead, remains valid but at a cost to the models’
accuracy. The scale of such errors can be numerically es-
timated so there is an advantage to using as much data as
possible and then studying the systematic effects of cer-
tain limitations. This approach allows the implicit inclu-
sion of higher-order effects in the DNN model, providing
the means for a more comprehensive analysis that can
handle a wider kinematic range without sacrificing fac-
torization validity. However, careful consideration and
validation are necessary to ensure the reliability of the
model as well as accurate quantification of the system-
atic error as a function of phT.
The applicability of TMD factorization was ensured
by applying cuts to SIDIS data based on various cri-
teria in the literature. Although, the limit qT≪Q
[12, 13, 15, 16, 69–72] covers the conventional TMD fac-
torization formalism, the large- Qrequirement is needed
for suppressing the power corrections ∼m2/Q2and
∼Λ2/Q2, where Λ is a general nonperturbative scale of
QCD. Since mand Λ are ∼1 GeV, Q >2 GeV condition
was applied on top of the δ=phT/(zQ)≤0.3 condition
in [7, 11] although the phenomenological region for δis
0.2−0.3 in order for the TMD factorization to be valid.
It is practically well known by the effort on global fits,
that accommodating more data points is a bigger chal-
lenge when using a smaller lower bound for δ. Therefore,
a more conservative limit qT/Q < 0.75 was used in [9] to
retain a large enough data set to perform a meaningful
fit. On the other hand, a combination of cuts: Q2>1.63
GeV2, 0.2< z < 0.6, 0.2< p hT<0.9 GeV was ap-
plied in [5], and also discussed in detail in [73] with thestandpoint that, data which satisfy phT≪Qmay not
satisfy qT≪Qdepending on the value of zhbecause
qT≃phT/zh, and therefore be difficult to describe in a
TMD approach. Not only in Sivers function extractions
but this is also the case for other TMDs extractions [74].
In this exploratory effort with DNNs, such later-
mentioned power corrections are not directly imposed.
In addition to the data basic cut Q2>1 GeV2we per-
formed Q2>2 GeV2andphT< zQ cuts separately
with the proton-DNN model to understand the impact on
the extracted Sivers functions. In addition, a dedicated
DNN fit has been performed with the JAM20 [5] cuts:
i.e.Q2>1.63 GeV2, 0.2< z < 0.6, 0.2< phT<0.9
GeV as a demonstration of impact from such a selective
combination of cuts on the extracted Sivers functions.
The results are plotted in Fig. 17 only representing
the Sivers functions for u, dflavors. In summary, all cuts
analyzed which respect Q2>2 GeV2andphT< zQ ,
except the JAM20 [5] cuts, are consistent with the DNN
model that only contains the Q2>1 GeV2cut which
for this data set is no cuts at all. Note that Q2>1 is
the recommended generic cut in [16] assuming the appli-
cation of corrections and error estimates for increasing
qT. The deviation measured in this study of cuts that is
strictly dependent on qTis only of ∼2% so it is clearly
advantageous to incorporate a wide range of qTto ensure
that there is implicit inclusion of these corrective contri-
butions to the hadronic tensor from the Y-term built into
the DNN model. The Fig. 18 shows the resultant Sivers
functions from proton-DNN for all six light quark flavors
with relatively small uncertainty bands caused by the se-
lection of cuts in JAM20 [5]. Note that the uncertainty
band represents the statistical component with 68% CL
from 1000 replica models.

B. Systematic Study on Choice of h(k⊥)
In the original framework [4], the Sivers function is
written as the factorized form, Eq. 4, where h(k⊥)
is understood to be of an unknown form that is sim-
ply postulated by the authors (in [4]) based on the as-
sumed kinematic response. Indeed, the analytical ex-
pression of h(k⊥) has been treated with various types of
ansatz and mostly with the Gaussian type parameteriza-
tion [4, 5, 7, 35, 51]. It’s also entirely possible that this
term has nothing to do with the proper theoretical treat-
ment as suggested in [6]. When a term in the factorized
TMD expression is required to manage some kinematic
behavior but has not been formally derived, the DNN
analysis presented can be particularly useful as it allows
for a high-quality fit despite the dependence of h(k⊥). Af-
ter the determination of the other terms using the DNN,
likeNq(x) in this case, the terms can then be separated
and studied independently to determine the interpreta-
tion. If h(k⊥) or any of the multiplicative terms are biases
then the DNN can be used to compensate for the bias.
This is done by building an architecture that has orders
of magnitude more parameters (usually thousands) than
the expression in question, h(k⊥) in this case. This ef-
fectively reduces the weight of h(k⊥) in the fit. This can
be done progressively and systematically with intentional
control of how much each term contributes to the fit. In
the fit performed for this analysis, we build the DNN to
optimize the loss directly so the contribution of h(k⊥) to
the final fit is small though the DNN becomes specialized
to the particular h(k⊥). In this way, the DNN directly
mitigates any type of incorrect ansatz if the final num-
ber DNN parameters is very large with respect to h(k⊥).
This can be done while still rendering a high-quality nu-
merical model encoding all information available in the
data. The DNN term becomes uniquely parameterized to
account for the biases while the resulting combination ofterms in the model remains largely unbiased, even though
each individual term may not be independently meaning-
ful. It should be noted that for our analysis the choice of
having the DNN model Nq(x)rather than Nq(x)h(k⊥) or
some other choice is arbitrary and done purely as an ex-
ercise to demonstrate the flexibility of the technique. To
study the systematic variation of the choice of h(k⊥), we
used the same candidate functions for h(k⊥) that were
also used in [35]. Those are,
h(k⊥) =√
2ek⊥
m1e−k2
⊥/m2
1, (35)
and
h(k⊥) =2k⊥m1
m2
1+k2
⊥. (36)
The model must be trained separately with each h(k⊥)
creating entirely different models for Nq(x) that result
in the same Sivers function as shown in Fig. 19. The
solid line with dark band represents the Sivers func-
tions with h(k⊥) =√

line with light-band represents the Sivers functions with

ble of incorporating both types of h(k⊥) without affect-
ing the Sivers functions in the final model as well as the
asymmetries (with deviation less than 1%).

butions from our proton -DNN model for all light quark
flavors in SU(3)flavor atx= 0.1 and Q2= 2.4 GeV2are
shown in Fig. 20. The observed shifts in each quark
flavor are linked to the correlation between the OAM of
quarks and the spin of the proton. The results shown in
Fig. 20 provide evidence of non-zero OAM in the wave
function of the proton’s valence and sea quarks. The pro-
ton-DNN model calculations for the uanddquarks are
similar to those reported in [7, 51], where the distortion
has a positive shift for the u-quark and a negative shift
for the d-quark with respect to the + xdirection. From
the results in Fig. 20, the proton -DNN model demon-
strates that a virtual photon traveling towards a polar-
ized proton “sees” an enhancement of the quark distribu-
tion, in particular more u,¯u-quarks to its right-hand side
and more d,¯d-quarks to its left-hand side in the momen-
tum space. Moreover, the resultant shifts for ¯ u, squarks
from the proton -DNN model are also in agreement with
[7]. In the low-x region, the momentum space quark den-
sity becomes almost symmetric [51], and it indicates that
the Sivers effect becomes smaller and the corresponding
experimentally observed asymmetry is small.The forthcoming data from Jefferson Lab at 12 GeV,
Fermilab SpinQuest experiment, and the anticipated fu-
ture data from the Electron-Ion Collider [75–77], along
with their extensive kinematic coverage, are expected
to provide invaluable insights into the 3D structure of
the nucleon. Obtaining a model-independent estimate
of quark angular momentum requires parton distribu-
tions that simultaneously depend on both momentum
and position [78–81]. In addition to experimental ob-
servations, lattice QCD (LQCD) computations provide a
valuable tool for QCD phenomenology from first princi-
ples. For instance, LQCD has been utilized to investigate
the Sivers effect and other TMD observables at different
pion masses [82] as well as the generalized parton dis-
tribution at the physical pion mass [83]. Additionally,
LQCD results on the Collins-Soper kernel over a range
ofbT(the Fourier transform of the transverse momen-
tum) are useful for global fits of TMD observables from
different processes [84]. In this way, LQCD could com-
plement the experimental data and open up an avenue
to enhance the DNN method to explore the 3D structure
of nucleons more directly.
VIII. EXPLORING EVOLUTION
The solution of the TMD evolution equations [12, 16],
µ2dF(x, b;µ, ζ)
dµ2=γF(µ, ζ)
2F(x, b;µ, ζ) (38)
ζF(x, b;µ, ζ)
dζ=−D(b, µ)F(x, b;µ, ζ) (39)
can be written as the following simplified form in terms
of the Fourier transform of k⊥(i.e., b) [7] where Fcan
be any TMD distribution
F(x, b;µ, ζ) =ζ
ζµ(b)−D(b,µ)
F(x, b), (40)
andD(b) is the nonperturbative Collins-Soper kernel.
Also in the literature, these scales were generally selected
as
µ∼Q, ζ FζD∼Q4, µ2=ζ2=Q2(41)
[6–8, 16, 85], and the global fits have been performed us-
ing some form of evolution factor as a function of the
Collin-Soper kernel. Although the full analysis of incor-
porating TMD evolution from the DNN fit is beyond the
scope of this work, a preliminary DNN fit has been per-
formed by modifying the Nq(x) asNq(x, Q2) by adding
a separate input node for Q2in addition to x. The
Fig. 21 shows the percentage of the Sivers asymmetry
(Asin(ϕh−ϕS)
UT ) vsQ2(GeV2) in comparison with [6]. The
preliminary version of the TMD evolution from DNN is
in agreement with the observation in [6] within 68% CL
(with 1000 replica models) regarding the suppression of
the full asymmetry faster than ∼1/√Q, but slower than25
∼1/Q2. Moreover, the dynamic trend and consistency
with the evolution behavior seen in [6] indicates that a
complete evolution treatment at large Qmay be a collec-
tive effect and worthy of a deeper investigation with our
DNN approach.

As presented the Sivers function satisfies DGLAP evo-
lution but not a TMD evolution. We have however intro-
duced the first steps of how this analysis could be per-
formed. However, in order to perform the best evolution
analysis it would be best to start with no prior analytical
ansatz.
IX. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
In conclusion, this article demonstrates the effective-
ness of using specialized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
as part of a fit function used to obtain a global extraction
of the Sivers function from transverse single-spin asym-
metries experimental data. It has been clearly shown
that these tools are incredibly flexible and can be used to
build accurate models even under the condition that the
factorized terms contain biases. By training the model
with these terms present, the DNN can account for these
biases, resulting in a largely unbiased final model. This
approach enables the exploration of existing formalism
and the testing of new phenomenology while managing
and studying biases in individual terms. The proposed
method can provide a means to minimize errors and am-
biguity associated with the ill-defined expressions nor-
mally constructed to meet the factorization requirements.
Our proposed method leverages artificial intelligence
(AI) to perform global fits and extract the Sivers distri-
butions of unpolarized quarks in both polarized protons
and neutrons. We use a generating function to ensurerobustness and accuracy in the extraction process. Pro-
gressive improvement in the extracted information can be
achieved by optimizing architecture and the correspond-
ing hyperparameters using pseudodata generated in the
same kinematic bins as the real data and then translating
that improvement to real experimental data extraction.
Our schema handles complex and sparse data effectively,
with the generating function providing additional quality
control and the means to quantify accuracy and precision.
As the first attempt to extract the Sivers function us-
ing AI techniques, we chose the Nq(x) parameterization
of the deep neural net to incorporate all x-dependent fea-
tures. This initial DNN extraction of Nq(x) uses SIDIS
data from HERMES and COMPASS to build a Sivers
function model which can then be used to make predic-
tions for the Sivers asymmetries for both SIDIS and DY
processes. The fitting method successfully extracts the
Sivers function for valence quarks and light quark flavors
in a flavor-independent manner. This investigation is ex-
ploratory, with the intention of developing tools and tech-
niques that minimize error and maximize utility, which
we hope to expand upon in further work. The trained
model predicts results consistent with experimental data,
demonstrating its predictive capability. Projections for
the sea quark Siver function are made for the SpinQuest
experiment with polarized proton and deuteron targets.
There are two key challenges when using data to ex-
tract TMDs. One is the applicability of TMD factor-
ization and the other is achieving meaningful fit results.
An exploratory effort has been performed to address this
with our schema along with a variety of data cuts. As
a result, the DNN shows the variation of qTdependent
cuts, resulting in small deviations in the extracted Sivers
functions compared to the result with a wide range of qT,
and simultaneously following the TMD factorization the-
orem. We also analyze the TMD evolution of the Sivers
asymmetry, which aligns with previous work and indi-
cates the potential of the DNN approach. Further anal-
ysis in this direction is warranted.
Our method and techniques are intended to be sim-
ple and reproducible, highlighting the potential of AI
for data analysis and information extraction. Coopera-
tion between experimentalists, theorists, and the growing
computational efforts is crucial for accelerating advance-
ments in the field. A global effort to standardize data
collection, organization, and storage in an unbinned for-
mat with detailed covariance information must be devel-
oped to take full advantage of the AI tools now available.
AI and its emerging technologies will continue to accel-
erate the progress of data-driven physics, but the speed
of that progress largely depends on the level of foresight
and cooperation within the community.26
