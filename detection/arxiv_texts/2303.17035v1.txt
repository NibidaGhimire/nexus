ABSTRACT
Here, we present a simple solution to problems that have plagued (extra)\galactic" astronomers and
cosmologists over the last century. We show that \galaxy" formation, dark matter, and the tension in
the expansion of the universe can all be explained by the natural behaviors of an overwhelmingly large
population of exoplanets throughout the universe. Some of these ideas have started to be proposed
in the literature, and we commend these pioneers revolutionizing our understanding of astrophysics.
Furthermore, we assert that, since planets are obviously the ubiquitous answer to every current question
that can be posed by astronomers, planetary science must then be the basis for all science, and therefore
that all current funding for science be reserved for (exo)planetary science - we happily welcome all
astronomers and other scientists.

1.INTRODUCTION
It has come to our attention that a regrettably large
number of astronomers do not believe that the exis-
tence of planets outside our solar system can be proven
(Woodrum, Hviding, Amaro, and Chamberlain 2023).
These astronomers must have their head in the inter-
stellar clouds, since they cannot see the overwhelming
evidence that exoplanets are everywhere. By number,
exoplanets are the most common objects of their size or
larger in the universe by at least an order of magnitude.
We have evidence for an average of more than one planet
orbiting each star (e.g., Zhu & Dong 2021), and this does
not include the expected number of free-oating planets
that did not form around host stars or have been ejected
from their original systems (McDonald et al. 2021). Es-
timates predict upwards of one hundred thousand free-
oating planets per star in the universe - planets that
either possibly formed on their own in mini-collapses
of very locally concentrated matter, or more likely were
kicked out of their nascent protoplanetary disk by a big-
ger badder neighborhood bully planet (see e.g, Strigari
et al. 2012).
Due to their overwhelming ubiquity, we instead pro-
pose that planets are the solution to the current enigmas
of astronomy. As their presence and importance to the
eld has been proven time and again over the past three
decades, we must now begin to expand our planetary
horizons and test to see how much can be explained
by a universal \planetary theory of everything." Thereare many questions about the universe that are quickly
waved away by some explanation of \dark" whatever,
simply because no one has deigned to believe the an-
swer could just be planets.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we fo-
cus on the similarities of \galaxies" with protoplanetary
clouds and disks and how therefore \galaxies" are sim-
ply planetary systems forming on a large cosmic scale.
We discuss the \planets as dark matter" theory and
add our own discussion in Section 3. In Section 4 we
show that planets can help resolve the Hubble tension
between early-universe Planck CMB measurements and
recent-universe SN measurements of the Hubble con-
stant. Finally, we conclude that planetary science now
encompasses all of astronomy and provide a reasonable
statement on what that means for future astronomical
funding in Section 5.
2.\GALAXIES" ARE COSMIC PLANETARY
SYSTEMS
2.1. Morphology, and the return of the tuning fork
\Galaxy" morphology typically splits \galaxies" into
two primary categories: spiral and elliptical. Early in
the history of extra-\galactic" astronomy, it was theo-
rized that these two morphological classes were the be-
ginning and end states of an evolutionary sequence com-
monly referred to as the \Hubble tuning fork". In this
sequence, all \galaxies" begin as diuse and bulbous el-
liptical \galaxies", and over time coalesce into a spiralarXiv:2303.17035v1  [astro-ph.EP]  29 Mar 20232
structure. However, as a popular theory of these objects
being \galaxies" took hold, successive theories rejected
this evolutionary sequence. In contrast, this evolution-
ary sequence from amorphism to order precisely matches
how planetary systems form and evolve. The observed
morphology of so-called \galaxies" is a natural result of
planetary theory.
Protoplanetary disks form via the collapse of clouds of
gas. The initial cloud is amorphous, which explains the
observed shape of so-called \elliptical galaxies". Fig-
ure 1 compares a sketch of a protoplanetary cloud to
the observed object NGC 4150. The ovular, egg-like
shape of NGC 4150 matches the shape of a protoplane-
tary cloud. Therefore, the best explanation is that this
so-called \elliptical galaxy" is actually a protoplanetary
cloud which is likely in the process of collapsing into a
cosmic-scale protoplanetary disk, from which a plethora
of planetary systems will be born. This explanation
is strongly consistent with the Hubble tuning fork, as
a Yakov-Smirnov B-S test of separating populations or
models (see e.g., Charfman et al. 2002, even if their main
nding has since been challenged) cannot distinguish be-
tween the evolution of protoplanetary clouds/disks and
the Hubble tuning fork for \galaxy" morphology at a
signicant level.
The next stage of planet formation includes the con-
golometration and accretion of solids into protoplanets
within the protoplanetary disk. Once large enough,
these protoplanets interact with the disk and create
structures like spirals. Figure 2 shows the result of a sim-
ulation of a protoplanet embedded within its disk. Spi-
rals and density waves naturally appear, and even pro-
vide observable evidence for that planet. These planet-
induced structures are precisely what we see from so-
called \spiral galaxies" which, as shown in Figure 2, ex-
hibit the same exact spiral arms and density uctuations
predicted in the protoplanetary disk simulation. There-
fore, these \spiral galaxies" must be large-scale disks
actively forming a sizeable population of planets. This
explanation is fully consistent with these spiral systems
following the aforementioned elliptical systems in the
evolutionary tuning fork.
2.2. Planetary Formation Scales
Since we have now shown that \galaxies" themselves
are rather protoplanetary clouds and disks, we must ad-
dress the scales of planetary formation. Local planetary
systems form around stars, which happens on length
scales of AU and timescales of millions of years. On the
other hand, cosmic-scale planetary systems that form
around the central core super-star at the center of these
\galaxies" have a greater length scale of kiloparsecs, andtheir timescale must correspondingly be larger by a sim-
ilar factor.
With the distance of 1 AU when expressed in cen-
timeters only a factor of 2 dierent from 1 Myr when
expressed in seconds, we can assume that this scaling
for cosmic protoplanetary systems must roughly be of
a similar magnitude. Thus, a length scale of 1 kpc in
cm would then roughly correspond to a timescale of 100
trillion years, which is much longer than the age of the
universe. Therefore, at just 14 billion years we are only
seeing a snapshot of a few early disk-forming cosmic
planetary systems, along with some still-nebulous cos-
mic protoplanetary clouds that have yet to start their
disk formation phase.
3.PLANETS AS DARK MATTER
Since \galactic" astronomers don't believe in planets,
they have been missing the most obvious candidate for
dark matter. The invisible and almost purely gravita-
tional eects of dark matter on \galaxies" and \galaxy
clusters" can easily be explained by bunches of the afore-
mentioned free-oating planets (Strigari et al. 2012), or
even dark matter exoplanets that have been theorized
to exist (Bai et al. 2023).
Dark matter is theorized to have dierent forms
separated by the initial budget of kinetic en-
ergy/temperature, imaginatively named \cold dark mat-
ter" and \warm/hot dark matter". Cold dark matter
(CDM) is expected to comprise a majority of the dark
matter in the universe, forming a halo around individ-
ual \galaxies" that speeds up their dierential rotation
curves, as well as interacting with visible matter within
the intracluster medium of \galaxy clusters" and along
laments of large-scale \galactic" structure in the uni-
verse.
3.1. Dark Matter Decient \Galaxies"
A recent problem that has emerged in \galaxy" for-
mation theories is the existence of dark matter decient
\galaxies": diuse satellite systems with little to no dark
matter halo surrounding them (see e.g., van Dokkum
et al. 2018). Many teams of theorists have set out to
solve the problem of dark matter decient \galaxies"
by running complicated and computationally intensive
cosmological simulations to explain how these \galax-
ies" can exist (e.g., Moreno et al. 2022). Since these
theorists most likely do not believe in the existence of
exoplanets, they have been missing the simple solution
all along.
We argue that these \galaxies" are not dark matter
decient, but planet decient. To prove this argument,
we introduce the Charfman-Avsar relation, which is as3

shows the same nebulous elliptical structure with a concentrated center and slowly radially decreasing brightness prole as the
protoplanetary cloud. Thus, the \galaxy" is simply a protoplanetary cloud before its evolution into a protoplan-
etary disk.

VLT. Right: an image of NGC 1365, here referred to as a \spiral galaxy". Note that the morphology of this supposed \galaxy",
complete with spiral arms, a potential barred center, and overall brightness of the armed structure, precisely matches both the
simulated and observed protoplanetary disk. It is thus clear that NGC 1365 is instead a protoplanetary disk.

follows:
Less Planets = Less Mass (1)
Other groups have tried to explain dark matter de-
ciencies through complex \galactic" evolution, involv-
ing tidal forces and \galactic" mergers. Our less com-
plicated proposition would be able to explain all obser-
vations through a single mechanism, reducing computa-
tional time for cosmological simulations. Although we
expect there to be pushback from the larger commu-nity, we assure this proposition is airtight and should be
adopted immediately.
3.2. MACHO Cold Dark Matter
Previous studies have looked into the presence of
planetary-mass non-self-luminous objects oating in the
outer reaches of \galaxies" that comprise this material
that only interacts gravitationally with the rest of the
visible matter in the universe. These \MAssive Compact
Halo Objects" (MACHOs, e.g., Carr & Primack 1990;4
Griest 1993, and many sources afterwards). Perhaps
notcoincidentally, the eld of exoplanets and the eld
of MACHO-dominated dark matter evolved contempo-
raneously in the early 1990s, suggesting a common basic
ideology.
Much additional work has since come out to \dis-
prove" the MACHO dark matter theory, mostly in the
form of microlensing surveys (e.g., Alcock et al. 2000;
Tisserand et al. 2007). These results claim that a fully
MACHO dark matter halo is inconsistent with their re-
sults, and that a fractional MACHO halo may be more
likely but still requires an additional component cur-
rently unknown to astronomy. However, microlensing
is inherently biased with requiring a dense stellar back-
ground, and even observing stars in front of the Milky
Way bulge for over a decade has produced <200 mi-
crolensing planets bound around their host stars (per
the NASA Exoplanet Archive as of the publication of
this manuscript), plus a few microlensing free-oating
planets (McDonald et al. 2021). Thus, we claim (con-
trary to any previous evidence to counter this) that ob-
serving a small fraction of the Milky Way halo towards
the Magellanic Clouds simply does not provide a dense
enough stellar background to detect microlensing free-
oating planets in the \galactic" halo to a large enough
degree.
3.3. Dark Matter Planets
While we have denitively proven that dark matter
is just planets, we can also look into the hypothesis of
dierent planet-sized objects made of dark matter that
are not themselves planets. Bai et al. (2023) state that
if dark matter exoplanets exist, they would mostly be
indistinguishable from regular matter planets via the
transit method unless they are large or of low opacity,
neither of which is likely with current theories. However,
since this requires a more complicated theory than dark
matter simply being regular planets, especially since the
dierence is negligible for most of the parameter space,
we reject that hypothesis.
Paice & J|C Watkins (2022) declare that, although
we have a good concept of the planetary components of
our solar system, we could still discover an additional
one by methods similar to those used to currently sup-
port the existence of Planet Nine (see e.g., Brown &
Batygin 2016). Indeed, a non-self-luminous planetary
body hiding inside our own solar system unable to be
detected by anything other than its aect on the orbits
of other bodies is very similar to what we see with the
eects of dark matter across \galaxies". Therefore, with
an example from an artist's rendition seen in Figure 3,
we unequivocally state that dark matter is just unseenplanets gravitationally aecting planetary systems on
both the stellar and cosmic scale.
There is also the Warm Dark Matter (WDM) compo-
nent that was previously believed to simply be the same
as cold dark matter, but with a relativistic initial energy
bucket. If this is true, it might have enough energy to
glow thermally even though it is dark optically. Lovell
(2022) found that lava matches many of the same ob-
servational signatures as WDM and is therefore a strong
candidate to explain WDM. Thus, rocky planets that are
cold and dark on the outside yet volcanically active on
the inside could be both the CDM we see everywhere as
well as the source of WDM that is less prevalent across
the universe.
4.RESOLVING THE HUBBLE TENSION WITH
PLANETS
One of the fundamental cosmological parameters of
which we know surprisingly little about is the Hubble
constant of the expanding universe. The original mea-
surements by Edwin Hubble placed the value somewhere
around 500 km/s/Mpc (Hubble 1929, and note how he
may have been ahead of the time with calling these
\galaxies" outside of the Milky Way as \nebulae"), and
as recently as the mid-1990s the actual value was still
debated to be between 50 and 100 km/s/Mpc (Bonnell
et al. 1996). However, recent data from Planck measur-
ing the CMB anisotropies gave a value of 67 :660:42
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2020), whereas distance lad-
der measurements using Cepheid variables and Type Ia
SN provide a value of 73 :041:04 (Riess et al. 2022),
which are discrepant at 5 .
Once again, the obvious solution to this problem is
planets, specically the planet formation timescale (as
referenced above in Section 2.2). The Planck measure-
ments of the CMB anisotropies were done in such an
early universe that we are sure there were absolutely no
planets around at that point, so the presence of plan-
ets was not included in determining the Hubble con-
stant, which provides the lower value. However, the dis-
tance ladder measurements come from the recent uni-
verse, which as we all know is teeming with planets.
Therefore, it is obvious that the presence of planets in
the recent universe have simply added on another pa-
rameter to the Friedman equation for the universe, such
that the Hubble constant has increased to its current
value. We introduce this as a natural corollary of the
Charfman-Avsar relation:
Corollary 1:More Planets
Unit Time/HigherH0
Unit Time(2)
Therefore, both the Planck measurements and the dis-
tance ladder measurements can be right in their own5

etc.It's all the same thing. Image Credit: nagualdesign, Tom Ruen, and ESO
observation epochs! See Figure 4 for an artist's impres-
sion of this phenomenon.
Another interesting recent measurement on the Hub-
ble constant is from Anand et al. (2022), done in the ex-
treme local and extreme recent universe with the Moon's
orbital recession from Earth. While this is a method in-
genious in its simplicity with a precise result, we believe
it is not as free from systematic biases and errors as they
claim. The measurement is only done with one planet
and one satellite object, which is hardly representative
of the universe as a whole with its untold magnitude of
planets, and the measurement is also only corrected for
tides without taking into account any other higher-order
issues that may occur. We suspect this is the reasoning
for the measurement below even the Planck value, even
though they do include more planetary bodies than the
Planck measurement does.
5.SUMMARY
•Planets are ubiquitous in the universe and are the
most common object known with their own self-
gravity.•\Galaxies" are really just cosmically large plan-
etary systems evolving on timescales longer than
the age of the universe.
•Dark matter actually does follow the MACHO
paradigm, because it is trillions of free-oating
non-luminous planets.
•The formation of planets as the numerically dom-
inant object in the universe over its age has also
caused an increase in the Hubble constant over
that same age.
We recommend that \planetary science", hereafter,
should just be known as \science" since we have shown
that the planetary aspect is all-encompassing. And since
funding for science has been shown to be extremely im-
portant and correlated with many dierent success met-
rics for universities and institutes of higher study, we
assert that this funding must be used as we scientists
see t. We promise that all astronomers and other sci-
entists of previously-branded branches of the eld will
be welcomed into this new and exciting re-organization
of science.6
