We employ matrix product states (MPS) and tensor networks to study topological properties
of the space of ground states of gapped many-body systems. We focus on families of states in
one spatial dimension, where each state can be represented as an injective MPS of finite bond
dimension. Such states are short-range entangled ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. To
such parametrized families over Xwe associate a gerbe, which generalizes the line bundle of ground
states in zero-dimensional families ( i.e.in few-body quantum mechanics). The nontriviality of the
gerbe is measured by a class in H3(X,Z), which is believed to classify one-dimensional parametrized
systems. We show that when the gerbe is nontrivial, there is an obstruction to representing the
family of ground states with an MPS tensor that is continuous everywhere on X. We illustrate our
construction with two examples of nontrivial parametrized systems over X=S3andX=RP2×S1.
Finally, we sketch using tensor network methods how the construction extends to higher dimensional
parametrized systems, with an example of a two-dimensional parametrized system that gives rise to
a nontrivial 2-gerbe over X=S4.

I. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
A. Introduction
The space of gapped quantum many-body systems has
a rich topological structure. For instance, suppose we
consider a space GHof gapped local Hamiltonians in
some fixed spatial dimension d.1It is a familiar idea
that distinct gapped phases of matter correspond to the
connected components of GH; each connected compo-
nent is the (infinite-dimensional) parameter space of a
gapped phase. It is less familiar that the topology of
the connected components themselves can be non-trivial,
as measured for instance via their homotopy groups πn.
Such non-trivial topology can put constraints on phase
diagrams, and lead to interesting phenomena in systems
with one or more continuously tuneable parameters.
While our remarks so far emphasize Hamiltonians, we
can just as well focus on ground states instead. Let Q
be the space of ground states of gapped local Hamil-
tonians in the same spatial dimension. Clearly there
is a map GH→Qthat sends a Hamiltonian to its
ground state. This map is believed to be a homotopy
equivalence.2Therefore, each connected component of Q
is the space of ground states associated to a phase, and all
the homotopy-theoretic properties of this space are the
same as the phase’s parameter space (connected compo-
nent of GH).arXiv:2305.07700v2  [cond-mat.str-el]  14 Jan 20252

FIG. 1. Illustration of approaches to probe the non-trivial topology of the space of ground states in spatial dimension d= 0
(a) and d= 1 (b). This paper introduces the ground state MPS gerbe and explains why a non-trivial Dixmier-Douady class is
an obstruction to finding a continuous MPS tensor defined globally over X.
The foundational example of this physics lies in few-
body quantum mechanics ( d= 0), and is simply a spin-
1/2 particle in a Zeeman field3,4
H(⃗B) =⃗B·⃗ σ=Bxσx+Byσy+Bzσz. (1)
We think of Equation (1) as defining a family of Hamilto-
nians continuously parametrized by ⃗B; clearly, the spec-
trum is gapped as long as ⃗B̸= 0. For the discussion
below, it is convenient to fix the magnitude |⃗B|=B,
which defines an S2subspace of parameter space. It is
convenient to refer to this example as a system over S2,
which means we have a family of Hamiltonians (or ground
states) with parameters lying in S2; this terminology is
defined more generally and precisely below in Sec. I B.
The topological non-triviality of the above family
of Hamiltonians can be understood in terms of the
Berry curvature 2-form, which gives a non-zero quan-
tized Chern number when integrated over S2. Another
approach focuses on the family of quantum ground states
over S2; mathematically, this defines a line bundle over
S2(we review some basics of line bundles below). Line
bundles over Xare classified by their first Chern class, an
element of the cohomology group H2(X,Z), where here
X=S2. Physically, a non-vanishing first Chern class
is an obstruction to making a continuous global choice
of the phase of the ground state wave function over S2.
Moreover, the Chern number as obtained from Berry cur-
vature can also be viewed as an element of H2(S2,Z)5,
so we have two ways to obtain the first Chern class, each
using distinct geometric objects, the Berry curvature on
one hand, and the ground state line bundle on the other,
as illustrated in Figure 1(a).
There are many higher-dimensional analogues of the
spin-1 /2 particle in a magnetic field. The most familiar
of these is the Thouless charge pump6ind= 1, where
a quantized amount of conserved U(1) charge is pumped
across the system upon adiabatically tuning a parameter
θ∈S1through a cycle. The Thouless pump is a systemoverS1, and can be thought of as a means to probe the
topology of the infinite-dimensional spaces GHorQfor
gapped systems in d= 1 with a U(1) symmetry imposed.
In particular, the non-triviality of the Thouless charge
pump implies that the appropriate connected component
of these spaces has non-trivial π1.
Recent years have led to new examples beyond the
Thouless charge pump, and a deeper understanding
thereof.7–21In particular, Kapustin and Spodyneiko gen-
eralized the Berry curvature 2-form to a higher Berry
curvature ( d+ 2)-form for gapped systems in dspatial
dimensions.7For a family of Hamiltonians whose param-
eters lie in a ( d+2)-dimensional space X, integrating the
higher Berry curvature over Xgives an invariant that
is believed to be quantized and take values in (the free
part of) Hd+2(X,Z), generalizing the Chern number to
gapped systems in d≥1.22
These developments leave open the following questions
that we address in this paper:
1. In dimension d= 0, the ground state line bundle
characterizes the invertible phase over X. Ind≥1,
what geometric object plays an analogous role?
2. What feature of the description of the ground state
overXis obstructed when the Hd+2(X,Z) class is
non-trivial?
One might guess that in d≥1 we should again con-
struct a line bundle of ground states, but this is not
the right approach, making the problem more interest-
ing. Perhaps most simply, the first Chern class valued
inH2(X,Z) is the only characteristic class of a line bun-
dle, but we want a class in Hd+2(X,Z). Moreover, the
family of ground states of a spatially infinite system does
not even naturally assemble into a line bundle, because
different ground states do not lie in the same Hilbert
space.23Therefore, a different kind of mathematical ob-
ject is needed.3
Here we consider parametrized families of ground
states in d= 1 that can be described as matrix prod-
uct states (MPS). Related work studying parametrized
systems using MPS can be found in Refs. 17, 19, and 20.
While we assume that each ground state can be written
as an injective MPS, it turns out to be essential not to
assume the bond dimension of the injective MPS tensor
is constant as parameters are varied. Given such a fam-
ily parametrized over a space X, we construct a math-
ematical object known as a gerbe over X. A gerbe is
a generalization of a line bundle associated with a class
valued in H3(X,Z) known as the Dixmier-Douady class.
In this context, a non-trivial Dixmier-Douady class is an
obstruction to finding an MPS tensor which is defined
continuously over all of X. See Figure 1(b) for an illus-
tration.
In addition, we consider higher dimensional general-
izations, where MPS are replaced with projected en-
tangled pair states (PEPS). In d= 2 we argue that
a parametrized family of PEPS results in a 2-gerbe, a
higher generalization of a gerbe, and give an explicit ex-
ample. This construction is based on the gerbe asso-
ciated to a parametrized family of MPS, and suggests
an inductive construction of d-gerbes in d-dimensional
parametrized families of PEPS.
B. Background: parametrized systems
In the above discussion, we considered various
parametrized families of Hamiltonians or ground states.
Such families are parametrized quantum systems , which
we now define more formally following Ref. 24. See also
Ref. 25 for a mathematically rigorous treatment. We
fix a spatial dimension d, a symmetry group G, and a
choice of whether to consider bosonic or fermionic sys-
tems. In this paper, we focus on bosonic systems with
trivial symmetry G. Leaving out some technical details,
these choices specify a space of gapped local Hamiltoni-
ansGHand a corresponding space of ground states Q.26
A parametrized quantum system, or a system over X, is
then a continuous map
ω:X→Q, (2)
where ω(x) is the ground state for x∈X, and where Xis
a topological space that we think of as a space of tuneable
parameters. Typically Xis some nice, finite-dimensional
space, and is referred to as the parameter space; however,
Xshould be distinguished from the infinite-dimensional
parameter space GH. For the spin-1 /2 in a Zeeman field,
X=S2, while for the Thouless charge pump, X=S1.
Alternatively, and essentially equivalently, we can define
a system over Xas a continuous map H:X→GH. In
this paper we use these two definitions interchangeably
but emphasize parametrized systems defined as families
of ground states.
Parametrized quantum systems are of interest in part
as a means to probe the topology of the infinite-dimensional spaces QandGH. This is closely related to
the notion of parametrized phases. Two systems ω0(x)
andω1(x) over Xare said to be in the same phase over X
if the maps ω0:X→Qandω1:X→Qare homotopic.
That is, there exists a continuous function ω(x, t)∈Q
where x∈Xandt∈[0,1], and such that ω(x,0) = ω0(x)
andω(x,1) = ω1(x). Parametrized phases over Xare
thus nothing but homotopy classes of maps [ X,Q]; tak-
ingX=Sn, these homotopy classes are simply elements
of the homotopy groups πn. For simplicity, we have ig-
nored the important role of stabilization by stacking with
trivial systems (defined below). We refer the reader to
Refs. 24 and 25 for discussions from different points of
view, and for more details on parametrized phases. The
latter reference describes a setup where stacking stabi-
lization is built into a construction of the space Q, and
in this setup parametrized phases really are homotopy
classes of maps.
We define the trivial system over Xto be one where
the map ωis constant as a function of x∈Xandω(x)
is a product state over individual lattice sites. A system
over Xis said to be nontrivial if it does not belong to
the same phase as the trivial system over X.
Beyond probing the topology of QandGH,
parametrized systems are physically interesting in their
own right. We can think of a parametrized system as
modeling a system with one or more continuously tune-
able parameters, and parametrized phases as capturing
associated universal phenomena. For example, in Ref. 24,
some of the authors introduced a solvable d= 1 spin
system over S3, and analyzed the quantized pumping of
Berry curvature across the system. This system will play
an important role in this paper, and following Ref. 24
we refer to it as a Chern number pump.27With open
boundary conditions, each end of the d= 1 chain has a
single gapless Weyl point as parameters are varied over
S3. Such behavior is not possible for a system in d= 0,
and reflects an “anomaly in the space of coupling con-
stants” as in Ref. 28.
Finally, parametrized systems are also of interest
in connection with Kitaev’s proposal that spaces of
d-dimensional gapped invertible systems form a loop
spectrum.29–31This implies that (non-parametrized) in-
vertible phases in ddimensions are classified by a gener-
alized cohomology theory Ed(pt), where pt is the single-
point topological space. If instead we evaluate the same
cohomology theory on some more interesting space X,
then Ed(X) gives the classification of invertible phases
overX.
C. Summary of results
We now give a high-level overview of the constructions
employed in this paper and their implications. It is in-
structive to present our results in analogy with the more
familiar case of d= 0 systems, and we begin by review-
ing this case. In particular, we describe the construction4
FIG. 2. Schematic summary of the constructions of line bundles, gerbes, and 2-gerbes in terms of tensor networks in spatial
dimensions d= 0,1,2, respectively. Within each open set Ua, we continuously choose a few-body wavefunction (a d= 0
tensor network), an MPS, or a PEPS, representing the states of a parametrized family. In d-dimensions, within double overlaps
Uab=Ua∩Ub, the object which relates the representations from the two open sets is essentially the same object that was
defined on open sets in ( d−1)-dimensions, leading to a hierarchical structure. For example, in d= 1 we have a MPS tensor
of bond dimension Dain each open set Ua, from which we obtain a matrix V∈CDa⊗(CDb)∗on double overlaps relating the
two MPS. (More precisely, this holds when one of the MPS is injective on Uab.) This matrix can be thought of as a vector
inCDaDb, the same kind of object that appears within each open set for the d= 0 family, thus relating the middle and left
panels. The right and middle panels are similarly related. In d= 2, we have a PEPS tensor on each open set Ua, and a matrix
product operator (MPO) Vrelating the two PEPS on each double overlap. The MPO can be viewed in the standard fashion
as an MPS tensor, as appears within the open sets for d= 1.
of the ground state line bundle over X, which in turn
completely characterizes the phase over X.
LetHbe the d= 0 system’s finite-dimensional Hilbert
space, and let {Ua}be a cover of Xby open sets. We
suppose that for each open set there is a continuous func-
tion Ψ a:Ua→ H whose value Ψ a(x) is the ground state
wave function of the Hamiltonian H(x). Now consider
a double overlap Uab=Ua∩Ub. For x∈Uab, we must
have Ψ a(x) =gab(x)Ψb(x), where gab(x) is a non-zero
complex number. This statement holds because physi-
cal states are rays in Hilbert space, so while Ψ a(x) and
Ψb(x) need not be the same vector in Hilbert space, they
both represent the ground state of H(x) and must lie in
the same ray. Therefore, for every double overlap, we
have a continuous map gab:Uab→C×, where C×is the
multiplicative group of non-zero complex numbers. This
is illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 2. The transition
functions satisfy a compatibility condition on triple over-
lapsUabc=Ua∩Ub∩Uc, namely gac(x) =gab(x)gbc(x)
for all x∈Uabc.
A line bundle over Xcan be specified by giving an open
cover {Ua}and a set of transition functions satisfying
the compatibility condition. Essentially equivalently, the
same data specifies a principal C×-bundle over X; we
will mainly work with principal C×-bundles in this paper.
Note that, above, the local ground state wave functions
Ψaare only used as an intermediate step to obtain the
gabtransition functions; the Ψ aare not actually needed
as part of the data used to specify the ground state line
bundle.
For concreteness, we examine the spin-1 /2 particle in
a Zeeman field (1). Cover X=S2with two open setsUN=S2\(0,0,−1) and US=S2\(0,0,1). The overlap
UN∩USis homotopy equivalent to the equatorial S1. On
the two open sets, the ground state wave function can be
written as
|ψN(θ, ϕ)⟩=−sinθ
2e−iϕ|↑⟩+ cosθ
2|↓⟩
|ψS(θ, ϕ)⟩=−sinθ
2|↑⟩+ cosθ
2eiϕ|↓⟩. (3)
Note that neither wave function can be extended contin-
uously over all of S2. For instance, |ψN(θ, ϕ)⟩depends
onϕas the south pole θ=πis approached, so there is
no way to extend |ψN(θ, ϕ)⟩to a function continuous at
the south pole. On the overlap UN∩US, the two wave
functions differ by the transition function
g:UN∩US→U(1)⊂C×
(θ, ϕ)7→eiϕ. (4)
which has a nonzero winding number around the equato-
rialS1. The winding number of the transition function
encodes the non-triviality of the ground state line bun-
dle over S2, and indicates a fundamental obstruction to
making a continuous choice of phase for the ground state
over all of S2. Here there is only a single double overlap
and no triple overlaps, so the compatibility condition on
transition functions is superfluous.
In this paper, we describe how nontrivial families of
one-dimensional states can be understood in a “higher”
analogue of the above picture, illustrated schematically
in Fig. 2. To do so we make use of the formalism of
matrix product states (MPS),32which also play a funda-
mental role in the classification of one-dimensional phases5
of matter.33–35An MPS provides a description of a d= 1
ground state in terms of a three-index tensor A, as we
describe in more detail in Sec. II. We show how the for-
malism of MPS allows us to naturally uncover the struc-
ture of a gerbe , which is the appropriate generalization
of a line bundle to d= 1 parameterized systems.
To derive the gerbe structure, we begin with an open
cover{Ua}ofX. We assume that on each Uathere ex-
ists a continuous MPS tensor A(x), which represents the
ground state as a function of parameters locally on X.36
On double overlaps Uab, two MPS tensors are related not
by a transition function, but by a transition line bun-
dle(or principal C×-bundle). This bundle arises from
the gauge degree of freedom in representing a ground
state with an MPS tensor: for a given ground state, the
choice of MPS tensor is not unique, as one can perform
matrix-valued gauge transformations on the tensor with-
out changing the state it describes. Under certain as-
sumptions, this gauge transformation is unique up to a
choice of a non-zero complex number. Even though this
number need not have unit modulus, i.e.it need not be
an element of U(1), we refer to it as a phase. Therefore,
at every point in Uab, we have two MPS tensors that are
related by a gauge transformation which is unique up to a
phase choice. This structure is drawn in the middle panel
of Fig. 2. The resulting phase degree of freedom at each
point in Uabsuggests the structure of a line bundle. In or-
der to capture all types of non-trivial d= 1 parametrized
phases, we will find it is necessary to go beyond the fa-
miliar case where gauge transformations are unique up
toC×, which introduces several technical challenges, but
the same intuition holds nonetheless.
The transition line bundles on double overlaps en-
code, in part, the topological information of a gerbe, to-
gether with some additional data (certain bundle isomor-
phisms on triple overlaps) and a compatibility condition
on quadruple overlaps, as reviewed in Sec. V A. A gerbe
is characterized by an element of H3(X,Z) known as its
Dixmier-Douady class, and a gerbe is trivial (by defini-
tion) when this class vanishes. If it is possible to choose
a continuous MPS tensor A(x) globally over X, then we
obtain a trivial gerbe. Therefore, a non-trivial gerbe in-
dicates an obstruction to a continuous global choice of
MPS tensor over X. In other words, for non-trivial d= 1
systems over X, even when the ground state can be ex-
actly described as an MPS tensor A(x) for all x∈X,
it is nevertheless impossible to choose A(x) continuously
everywhere.
An important feature of our construction is that it cap-
tures both torsion and non-torsion ( i.e.free) classes in
H3(X,Z). This is different from other constructions that
have appeared. The structure of the space of MPS has
been previously studied in Ref. 37, where the authors de-
scribed a PGL (χ)-bundle structure under the assump-
tion that the injective MPS bond dimension ( i.e. the
bond dimension when the tensor is injective) is constant
with value χoverX. Our construction shows that such
a bundle structure restricts the types of classes that canbe realized to be torsion only, and that this restriction
is removed by allowing the injective bond dimension to
vary over X.
As a key example that captures a non-torsion class,
we illustrate the construction of a gerbe for the d= 1
Chern number pump over X=S3introduced in Ref. 24.
We cover S3with two open sets UNandUSwhose over-
lapUN∩USincludes and is homotopy equivalent to the
equatorial S2, and we define continuous MPS tensors on
each open set. On the overlap, the transition line bun-
dle is given by the non-trivial line bundle describing the
ground state of the spin-1 /2 particle in a Zeeman field
as described above. In this case there are no triple or
quadruple overlaps, and the non-triviality of the line bun-
dle signals the non-triviality of the gerbe. Crucially, the
injective bond dimension of the tensors differs between
the two open sets, such that there is no PGL (χ)-bundle
structure, and the corresponding Dixmier-Douady class
is non-torsion.
As an example that captures a torsion class, we also
construct a gerbe associated to a nontrivial d= 1 system
overX=RP2×S1, which we introduce. The system over
Xis constructed using the suspension construction of
Ref. 24 and can be interpreted as a pump of the nontrivial
d= 0 system over RP2. Like in the example over S3,
we can cover RP2×S1with open sets U0andU1and
define continuous MPS tensors on each set. The overlap
U0∩U1is homotopy equivalent to RP2×S0, and the
transition line bundle relating the MPS tensors on U0and
U1is given by the ground state line bundle of a nontrivial
0dsystem over RP2. In this case, the injective bond
dimension is constant across Xwith χ= 2, so there is a
PGL (2)-bundle structure. The Dixmier-Douady class is
torsion, but it is non-zero and this signifies an obstruction
to lifting the PGL (2)-bundle to a GL(2)-bundle.
The ideas sketched above apply to higher dimensional
systems as well. The higher-dimensional analogue of
MPS is given by projected entangled pair states (PEPS)
which, in two-dimensions, represent the ground state in
terms of a five-index tensor.32Similar to MPS, different
PEPS tensors can describe the same state. In this case,
under certain technical and physical assumptions, the ob-
ject relating two PEPS tensors describing the same state
can be roughly viewed as a d= 1 state that can be ex-
actly described as an MPS. Therefore, if we repeat the
above construction by defining continuous PEPS tensors
on an open cover of X, then on each double overlap Uab
we effectively have a family of d= 1 states representable
as MPS, which we just argued defines a gerbe. This is
illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 2. The geometrical
object built from gerbes on double overlaps is called a
2-gerbe, and equivalence classes of 2-gerbes are indeed
described by elements of H4(X,Z),38which matches the
“within-cohomology” part of the conjectured classifica-
tion of d= 2 invertible parameterized systems. Since
PEPS representations are much less well understood than
for MPS, we do not give a rigorous derivation of this
2-gerbe in general, but we are able to show that the6
non-trivial d= 2 parameterized system over S4given in
Ref. 24 indeed realizes a non-trivial 2-gerbe. Finally, we
discuss how this perspective suggests a natural construc-
tion of d-gerbes associated to parameterized systems of
d-dimensional PEPS.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II
we provide a primer on the formalism of matrix product
states. Sec. III reviews the expectation for the classifi-
cation of parametrized systems from the perspective of
homotopy theory, and explains why we must go beyond
injective MPS of fixed bond dimension to recover the full
classification. We analyze the Chern number pump in
Sec. IV and provide an MPS representation for the fam-
ily of states. The general procedure for constructing a
gerbe given an MPS family is then given in Sec. V. We
then analyze our construction in the special case of fami-
lies where the injective bond dimension χis constant over
X, and show that it gives rise to a PGL (χ)-bundle as ex-
pected. We provide a non-trivial such example – a system
overRP2×S1– in Sec. VI. Finally, in Sec. VII, we sketch
how the construction extends to higher dimensions using
PEPS, and illustrate the ideas using a d= 2 parametrized
system over S4which also appeared in Ref. 24. We con-
clude with a discussion in Sec. VIII.
II. MATRIX PRODUCT STATE GENERALITIES
In this paper we will consider families of states which
admit translationally invariant MPS representations.
While in this paper we are mainly interested in infinite
systems, it is convenient for a moment to work on a pe-
riodic one dimensional lattice with Nsites, where each
on-site Hilbert space is Cn. A state admits a translation-
ally invariant MPS representation if it is of the form
|ψN(A)⟩=X
i1,...,iNTr 
Ai1Ai2. . . AiN
|i1, i2, . . . , i N⟩(5)
for some MPS tensor Ai
αβ,i∈ {0, . . . , n −1}, and
α, β∈ {1, . . . , D }. For each i,Aiis aD×Ddimen-
sional matrix acting on the so-called virtual space CD;
the constant Dis known as the bond dimension. If the
tensor Aiis injective (see below), it defines a pure state
of an infinite system that we denote by ωA.39,40Some-
what heuristically, the state ωAcan be thought of as the
N→ ∞ limit of the states |ψN(A)⟩.41We say that the
injective MPS tensor Airepresents or specifies the state
ωA.
It will be useful throughout this paper to use the graph-
ical notation of tensor networks. To this end, we repre-
sent the tensor Ain the following way,
Ai
αβ=
Ai
α β(6)
The coefficients of the wavefunction in Eq. (5) are thenexpressed graphically as
Tr 
Ai1Ai2. . . AiN
=i1...i2 iN
A A A(7)
where contracted indices are summed over, and the
curved lines at the end connect to each other, represent-
ing periodic boundaries.
An MPS tensor Aican be viewed as a linear map
A:MD(C)→Cnfrom linear operators on the vir-
tual space CDto the physical space Cn, given by M7→P
iTr (AiMT)|i⟩. The MPS tensor Aiis said to be injec-
tiveif this associated map is injective.32Injective MPS
tensors satisfy many nice properties, such as having a fi-
nite correlation length and being the unique ground state
of their (canonical) parent Hamiltonian. A more general
class of tensors is given by normal tensors , for which
the map M7→P
i1,...,iLTr (Ai. . . AiLMT)|i1, . . . , i L⟩be-
comes injective for some L. Given a normal tensor, the
minimum such Lis known as the injectivity length and
is bounded above by a function that depends only on
the bond dimension.42It follows that normal tensors be-
come injective upon “blocking” sites together into new
sites comprised of Loriginal sites; that is, the tensor
˜Ai1···iL≡Ai1···AiLis injective. Because this can be
done, in this paper we generally do not work with ten-
sors that are normal but not injective.43
For a state ωwith a translationally invariant MPS rep-
resentation, the tensor Aiused to represent the state is
not unique. It is clear from (5) that if the injective tensor
Airepresents ω, then so does λMAiM−1for any invert-
ible matrix M∈GL(D)≡GL(D,C) and any nonzero
complex number λ∈C×,i.e.ωA=ωλMAM−1. In fact,
the fundamental theorem of injective MPS states that
a pair of injective tensors AandBrepresent the same
state if and only if Bi=λMAiM−1for some Mandλ32.
The transformation Ai7→λMAiM−1is called a gauge
transformation of the tensor A. In particular, this means
AiandBihave the same bond dimension, so given a
state ωwith an injective MPS representation, the bond
dimension of an injective MPS tensor representing ωis
a well-defined quantity – we refer to this as the injec-
tive bond dimension of ωand denote it by χω. More-
over, given AiandBi,λis uniquely specified, and M
is unique up to a nonzero scalar multiple, M7→zM
with z∈C×. This means that, while M∈GL(D)
is not uniquely specified given AiandBi, the corre-
sponding element of the projective general linear group
PGL (D) =PGL (D,C) =GL(D)/C×is uniquely speci-
fied. To summarize, AiandBiare related by a unique
element of C××PGL (D).
In this paper we will also need to discuss MPS tensors
which are not injective.44Given a state ωrepresented
by an injective tensor Ai, and a not necessarily injective
tensor Bi, we say that Birepresents the state ωif
|ψN(B)⟩=λN|ψN(A)⟩ (8)7
for some λ∈C×for all N. While one can imagine weaker
definitions of what it means for Bito represent ω, work-
ing with this class of tensors allows us to take advantage
of an important technical tool known as a reduction .45In
Ref. 45, it is shown that if Eq. (8) holds, then there exist
matrices VandWsuch that V W =1and
V Bi1. . . BikW=λnAi1. . . Aik(9)
for the same λappearing in (8), and any string i1. . . ik.
The pair V,Wis called a reduction from BitoAi. We
discuss this further in Sections IV and V.
We conclude this section with a brief introduction to
some diagrammatic notations which will facilitate many
of our computations. For the purposes of this discussion
we will restrict to the case where the on-site Hilbert space
isC2, though of course this is easily generalized. The
key concept is the correspondence between operators and
states. A single-qubit operator can be turned into an
entangled state by “bending” the legs of the tensor:
O =⇒O . (10)
The meaning of this entangled state becomes clear when
considering the special case where Ois the identity. In
this case we have the correspondence
=⇒ =|Φ+⟩. (11)
which relates the identity operator with the Bell state
|Φ+⟩=|↑↑⟩+|↓↓⟩. Therefore the state corresponding
to the single-qubit operator Oin (10) is simply ( O⊗
1)|Φ+⟩. The state |Φ+⟩also satisfies the useful property
(O⊗1)|Φ+⟩= (1⊗OT)|Φ+⟩, which allows us to push an
operator through a Bell state,
O = OT. (12)
For notational convenience, we will also sometimes write
the operator acting on the Bell state in the middle of the
tensor. We define this to mean that the operator acts on
the first qubit of the Bell state:
O=O. (13)
III. TOPOLOGY OF SRE STATES AND MPS
Short range entangled phases in one spatial dimension
are expected to be classified by the Eilenberg-MacLane
space K(Z,3). This means that phases parametrized by
Xshould be in correspondence with homotopy classes of
maps [ X, K (Z,3)]∼=H3(X,Z). Ref. 7 introduced a cur-
vature three-form which, when integrated over the pa-
rameter space X, detects the free part of the class in
H3(X,Z).LetMχbe the space of states of an infinite system
which are representable by injective MPS of bond di-
mension χ. Physically, such states have finite correla-
tion length and are short-range entangled. For finite sys-
tems, it was proven in Ref. 37 that the set of injective
MPS tensors Aχof bond dimension χforms a principal
C××PGL (χ)-bundle over Mχ. We expect the same re-
sult to hold for infinite systems but to our knowledge it
has not been proved rigorously. The intuition for this is
given by the fundamental theorem of MPS (see Sec. II):
any two MPS tensors representing the same state are
related by a unique gauge transformation living in the
group C××PGL (χ), so the action is free and transitive
on the fibers. In Appendix B, we prove that, if we al-
low the onsite dimension to go to infinity, Mχis in fact
equivalent to the classifying space B(PGL (χ)×C×).
A family of states over Xrepresentable by injective
MPS of bond dimension χcan be thought of as a map
X→ M χ. (14)
Using this map we can pull back the canonical princi-
palC××PGL (χ)-bundle over Mχto obtain a principal
C××PGL (χ)-bundle over X. This is equivalent to two
separate C×andPGL (χ) principal bundles over X, and
we discuss these in turn.
Principal C×-bundles are classified by the first Chern
class H2(X,Z). To identify a physical interpretation of
this Chern class, we consider the d= 1 system over
X=S2obtained by placing a decoupled spin-1/2 parti-
cle in a Zeeman field (Equation (1)) on each lattice site.
Representing this system as an injective MPS with bond
dimension χ= 1 and constructing the corresponding C×-
bundle, one obtains a class that generates H2(S2,Z)∼=Z,
and which is simply the Chern class of a single spin-1/2
particle. We thus identify the H2(X,Z) class as a “Chern
number per crystalline unit cell,” which is expected to be
a well-defined phase invariant for a system with transla-
tion symmetry. We will for the most part not be in-
terested in this H2(X,Z) invariant. Indeed, to obtain
a nice definition of d= 1 parametrized phases without
translation symmetry, we expect it is necessary to take a
quotient by suitable decoupled systems to eliminate the
H2(X,Z) invariant.
We now turn to the PGL (χ)-bundle. It is natural to
ask whether nontrivial such bundles correspond to non-
trivial parametrized systems (ignoring the H2(X,Z) in-
variant). We argue that PGL (χ)-bundles cannot capture
all parametrized phases; in particular, they do not cap-
ture the known nontrivial phases over S3,7,24expected
to be classified by [ S3, K(Z,3)]∼=H3(S3,Z)∼=Z. Prin-
cipal G-bundles over S3are classified, via the clutching
construction, by homotopy classes of maps [ S2, G]. But
π2(PGL (χ)) = 0, so no nontrivial bundle exists.
This result strongly suggests that general nontrivial
d= 1 parametrized phases cannot be described using
injective MPS with a fixed bond dimension. One option
is to allow for families of states where the injective bond
dimension varies as a function of parameters. Indeed, we8
will see in Sec. IV that this is precisely what happens in
our main example of the Chern number pump over S3,
where the injective bond dimension takes values χ= 1,2
depending on x∈S3. This system can thus be thought
of as a map S3→ M 1∪ M 2. It is an important point
that this union of M1andM2should not be disjoint;
this follows from the construction of Sec. IV.46Because
χvaries, there is no longer an obvious principal bundle
structure over M1∪ M 2, which in part leads us to our
construction of a gerbe in Sec. V.
Nevertheless, it is possible for some Xto host non-
trivial PGL (χ)-bundles. Moreover, to such a principal
PGL (χ)-bundle over X, one can also assign a gerbe over
Xcalled the lifting gerbe; the lifting gerbe measures the
obstruction to lifting the PGL (χ)-bundle to a GL(χ)-
bundle. It is known47–49that these lifting gerbes corre-
spond to torsion elements of H3(X,Z). We give more
details on the relationship between PGL (χ)-bundles and
torsion in H3(X,Z) in Appendix C. This suggests that
parametrized systems over spaces Xwith the property
that H3(X,Z) contains torsion are related to families of
injective MPS of constant bond dimension χ, whose as-
sociated PGL (χ)-bundle are nontrivial, but do not lift
toGL(χ)-bundles. Conversely, parametrized systems
whose associated class in H3(X,Z) is non-torsion nec-
essarily cannot be represented by injective MPS of con-
stant bond dimension. In Section VI, starting from a
nontrivial family of states obtained from the suspension
construction,24we construct a family of injective MPS
over X=RP2×S1of constant bond dimension χ= 2
with a nontrivial PGL (2)-bundle.
Finally, let us comment on a possibility that we leave
unaddressed in this work. It is possible that the PGL (χ)-
bundle over Xassociated to a family of states is nontriv-
ial, but has a lift to a nontrivial GL(χ)-bundle. In this
case the associated H3(X,Z) class is trivial, and we ex-
pect the parametrized phase to be trivial, but the family
of MPS is still topologically distinct from the constant
family of MPS. We comment on this possibility further
in Appendix C, but leave a detailed analysis to future
work.
IV. MPS REPRESENTATION OF CHERN
NUMBER PUMP
In this section we review the model of the Chern num-
ber pump introduced in Ref. 24 and construct an MPS
representation for the family of ground states over S3.
As noted above, the ground states cannot be described
globally by a normal MPS tensor of constant bond di-
mension. However, this turns out to be a feature rather
than a bug; we will leverage the changing bond dimension
to describe the phase invariant of the system.
The model is a slight modification of the one given
in Ref. 24. We consider a one dimensional lattice with
two qubits per site and take the parameter space to be
X=S3. Sites are labeled by i∈Zand Pauli operators
FIG. 3. Dimerization pattern for different regions of w4. Unit
cells are shown in red, with blue and white sites denoting the
AandBsublattices respectively. The dimerization is inter-
site for w4≥1/2 and intra-site for w4≤ −1/2. The middle
region −1/2≤w4≤w4is completely factorized.
for the two qubits on each site are denoted σx,y,z
i,a and
σx,y,z
i,b. We parametrize elements x∈Xasx= (⃗ w, w 4)∈
S3⊂R4, where ⃗ wis a three-component vector such that
|⃗ w|2+w2
4= 1. The Hamiltonian takes the form
H(⃗ w, w 4) =X
i∈Z 
HB
i(⃗ w) +H+
i(w4) +H−
i(w4)
.(15)
The first term is an on-site field which takes opposite
values on the AandBsublattices,
HB
i(⃗ w) =⃗ w·⃗ σi,a−⃗ w·⃗ σi,b. (16)
The second and third terms are inter-site and intra-site
couplings, with
H+
i(w4) =g+(w4)⃗ σi,b·⃗ σi+1,a
H−
i(w4) =g−(w4)⃗ σi,a·⃗ σi,b. (17)
The functions g±(w4) are chosen to be
g+(w4) =(p
w2
4−1/4w4≥1
2
0 w4≤1
2(18)
and
g−(w4) =(
0 w4≥ −1
2 p
w2
4−1/4w4≤ −1
2(19)
Note that, for any value of w4, at most one of H+(w4)
orH−(w4) is nonzero. As a result, H(⃗ w, w 4) is always
a sum of decoupled two-qubit dimer Hamiltonians, each
of which is exactly solvable. It follows that the ground
state is a product state of dimers, where the dimerization
pattern depends on the value of w4, and consists of inter-
site dimers for w4≥0 and intra-site dimers for w4≤0
(see Fig. 3).
The spectrum of the full Hamiltonian is completely de-
termined by the spectrum of the zero-dimensional dimers,9
so it is easy to see that there is a unique gapped ground
state everywhere on S3. We cover S3by two open sets
UN=
(⃗ w, w 4)∈S3w4>−1
2
US=
(⃗ w, w 4)∈S3w4<1
2
.(20)
The overlap UNS=UN∩UScan be viewed as a thickened
version of the equatorial S2defined by w4= 0. Indeed,
UNSis homotopy equivalent to S2. The ground state of
each dimer can be written in the following form:
|ψ⟩N/S
dimer=
U(⃗ w)⊗U(⃗ w)
ΛN/S(⃗ w)⊗1
|Φ+⟩(21)
=
U(⃗ w)ΛN/SU(⃗ w)T⊗1
|Φ+⟩ (22)
=˜ΛN/S . (23)
This state |ψ⟩N
dimer is defined on UNand lives on inter-site
dimers, while |ψ⟩S
dimer lives on intra-site dimers and is
defined on US(see Fig. 3). Here, |Φ+⟩=1√
2(|↑↑⟩+|↓↓⟩)
is the Bell state as in (11). The U(⃗ w) are single-site
rotation matrices
U(θ, ϕ) =
cosθ
2−sinθ
2e−iϕ
sinθ
2eiϕcosθ
2
(24)
which rotate eigenstates of σzto eigenstates of ˆ w·⃗ σ. Here,
θandϕare the usual spherical polar coordinates for the
unit vector ˆ w=⃗ w/|⃗ w|. Note that Uis not globally well-
defined on S2. ΛN(⃗ w) and ΛS(⃗ w) are single-site (non-
unitary) operators given by
ΛN(⃗ w) =


0 −q

(26)
Note that ΛN/S(⃗ w) are continuous at |w4|= 1/2 since
|⃗ w|=√
3/2. The operators ΛN/S(⃗ w)⊗1send|Φ+⟩to
the ground state of the dimer Hamiltonian when ⃗ wis
along the ˆ zaxis. Finally we have defined ˜ΛN/Sto be
UΛN/SUT. It can be checked that ˜ΛN/S(⃗ w) indeed give
well-defined continuous functions on UN/S.The diagrammatic representation of the family of
ground states of (15) is formed by tensoring together the
diagrammatic representations of the dimers (23). The
ground state on UNis
|GS⟩= ˜ΛN ˜ΛN ˜ΛN ,
(27)
while the ground state on USis
|GS⟩= ˜ΛS ˜ΛS ˜ΛS .
(28)
We have depicted the ground state for finite systems of
six qubits with periodic boundary conditions. We can
then read off the MPS tensors from the diagram, group-
ing pairs of qubits into sites as indicated by the dashed
boxes. The MPS tensor on UNis
Aij
N=ij
˜ΛN(29)
=|i⟩⟨j|U(⃗ w)ΛN(⃗ w)U(⃗ w)T. (30)
The MPS tensor on USis found similarly as
Aij
S=ij
˜ΛS(31)
=⟨i|U(⃗ w)ΛS(⃗ w)U(⃗ w)T|j⟩. (32)
We now make the following observation. The tensor Aij
S
has bond dimension D= 1 and is injective everywhere it
is defined ( w4<1/2). On the other hand, the tensor Aij
N
has bond dimension D= 2 and is defined everywhere on
UN(w4>−1/2), but is only injective when w4>1/2.
As a result, on the overlapping region UNS, the ground
state can be represented both by the injective tensor Aij
S
and by the non-injective tensor Aij
N. InUNS, ΛN=|↑⟩⟨↓|
and ΛS=|↓⟩⟨↑| , so the MPS tensors simplify as
Aij
N=|i⟩⟨j|U(⃗ w)|↓⟩⟨↑| U(⃗ w)T
Aij
S=⟨i|U(⃗ w)|↑⟩⟨↓| U(⃗ w)T|j⟩. (33)
As discussed in Sec. II, these are related by a re-
duction from Aij
NtoAij
S. The reduction is given by
V=⟨↑|U(⃗ w)T,W=U(⃗ w)|↑⟩, which satisfies
V Aij
NW=⟨↑|U(⃗ w)T|i⟩⟨j|U(⃗ w)|↓⟩⟨↑| U(⃗ w)TU(⃗ w)|↑⟩
=⟨i|U(⃗ w)|↑⟩⟨↓| U(⃗ w)T|j⟩
=Aij
S.
(34)
Note, however, that WandVare not well-defined over
all of the equatorial S2. The problem occurs at θ=π,10
where the phase is not well-defined. This is essentially
the same phase ambiguity that occurs when trying to
write down a ground state wavefunction for the spin-1 /2
particle in a Zeeman field. We see that there is a nonzero
Chern number associated to the reduction from Aij
Nto
Aij
S. This hints at the nontriviality of the family (15);
we make this observation more precise in the following
section.
V. MPS GERBE
In this section we describe the construction of a gerbe
from a family of MPS. We begin with a definition of
gerbes in Sec. V A. Sec. V B is a review of the key techni-
cal idea of a reduction, which we extend to the setting of
continuous families of MPS. This gives, in some cases, a
C×-bundle on double overlaps Uα∩Uβ. This is in fact is
sufficient to construct the gerbe of the previous section,
which we show in Sec. V C. In Sec. V D we proceed to the
general construction of the gerbe. Finally, in Sec. V E we
apply our construction to the special case where the fam-
ily of MPS is injective everywhere.
A. Gerbes
Here we review the aspects of gerbes that are needed
in this paper. Gerbes are generalizations of line bun-
dles, or, equivalently, of principal C×-bundles. Gerbes
were introduced by Giraud in Ref. 50 as an attempt to
construct non-abelian cohomology in degree 2, whereas
(isomorphism classes of) principal fiber bundles represent
non-abelian cohomology in degree 1. In the C×-valued
case—and this is the only case we consider here—gerbes
are classified by degree 3 cohomology with values in Z.
There are several equivalent notions of such gerbes, and
they all give rise to degree 3 cohomology classes with co-
efficients in Z, called the Dixmier-Douady classes. We
review a formulation based on Ref. 51 which is most nat-
urally suited to an MPS formulation.
In the literature one often sees gerbes defined in terms
of line bundles, rather than principal C×-bundles as we
use below. A natural equivalence between these two con-
cepts is given by assigning to each principal C×-bundle
Pthe associated line bundle L=P ×C×C. As pointed
out before in Sec. I C, these bundles have the same C×-
valued transition maps. Thus, gerbes may equivalently
be defined using line bundles or principal C×-bundles.
We refer to Ref. 52 for further information on gerbes.
LetXbe a compact smooth manifold. A gerbe P
consists of the following data: an open cover {Ua}, a col-
lection of principal C×-bundles Pabdefined on the double
intersections Uab=Ua∩Ubtogether with bundle isomor-
phisms
Pab∼=P−1
ba, (35)where P−1denotes the inverse of the C×-bundle P(i.e.
Pwith the inverse C×-action), and additional bundle
isomorphisms
θabc:Pab⊗ Pbc→ P ac (36)
defined on triple intersections Uabc=Ua∩Ub∩Uc. The
isomorphisms θabcare required to satisfy an associativity
condition on quadruple overlaps, namely,
θacd(θabc⊗1) = θabd(1⊗θbcd). (37)
Together with the isomorphisms of (35), the maps θabc
give trivializations of the C×-bundle Pab⊗ Pbc⊗ Pca. If
{Ua}is a good cover, we can pick local sections sabon
each double overlap Uab. A choice of local sections defines
a function gabc:Uabc→C×over triple intersections via
θabc◦(sab⊗sbc) =gabcsac. (38)
The associativity condition is equivalent to the condition
that
gbcdgabd=gacdgabc
so that ( gabc) is a ˇCech 2-cocycle. Making a different
choice of local section s′
ab=fabsabdefines a new function
g′
abc=fabfbcfcagabc
sogabcchanges by a coboundary. Therefore, it represents
a class in ˇH2(X,C×). But the exponential sequence
Z2πi− − →Cexp− − →C×
gives rise to a long exact sequence
→ˇHk(X,C)∼=0→ˇHk(X,C×)→Hk+1(X,Z)→0→
which leads to the isomorphism
ˇH2(X,C×)∼=− →H3(X,Z).
So a gerbe P= (Pab) defines a cohomology class
d(P)∈H3(X,Z).
This is the Dixmier-Douady class of the gerbe.
AC×-valued ˇCech 1-cocycle ( gab) consists of continu-
ous functions gab:Uab→C×which satisfy g−1
ab=gba
and the condition gac=gabgbconUabc. As discussed in
Sec. I C, this is nothing but the transition functions for
a line bundle. The corresponding class in ˇH1(X,C×)∼=− →
H2(X,Z) is the first Chern class of the line bundle. We
thus see how the Dixmier-Douady class is the generaliza-
tion of the first Chern class of a line bundle.
Like in the d= 0 case where the integral of the Berry
curvature 2-form recovers the first Chern class of the line
bundle of ground states, the Dixmier-Douady class we
extract from a family of MPS d= 1 is related to the
phase invariant obtained by integrating the higher Berry
curvature 3-form7.11
B. MPS reductions
The method we use to construct a gerbe from a fam-
ily of MPS relies heavily on the notion of a reduction,45
which we review here. We define a ( χ, D)-reduction to be
a pair of matrices V:CD→Cχ, W:Cχ→CDsuch that
V W =1χ×χ; letRχ(D) denote the space of all ( χ, D)-
reductions. Note that V W =1χ×χimplies that χ≤D.
The space Rχ(D) can be shown to be homotopy equiv-
alent to the space of χ-frames in CD, typically denoted
byVχ(CD). This is explained in detail in Appendix A.
It was proven in Ref. 45 that given an MPS tensor A
of bond dimension Dand an injective MPS tensor Bof
bond dimension χ≤Dwhich represent the same state,
there exists a ( χ, D)-reduction V,Wsuch that
V Ai1. . . AikW=λkBi1. . . Bik(39)
for all strings i1. . . ik, with λ∈C×given by (8). The
pairV,Wsatisfying (39) is called a reduction from Ato
B. Let us review the construction of VandW. Since B
is injective, the corresponding map B:Mχ(C)→Cnhas
a left inverse B−1:Cn→Mχ(C):
B−1
B= . (40)
While this left inverse is not unique, we can take B−1to
be the Moore–Penrose inverse,
B−1:= (B†B)−1B†. (41)
In the above equation BandB†are to be understood as
maps B:Mχ(C)→CnandB†:Cn→Mχ(C). This
gives a canonical choice for the left inverse of B.
Next, consider the tensor TAB=B−1Adefined by
TAB=B−1A=nX
i=1 
B−1i⊗Ai. (42)
Since the MPS tensor components 
B−1iandAiare
operators on CχandCD, respectively, TABcan be viewed
as an operator on Cχ⊗CD. Hence we can apply the
Jordan–Chevalley decomposition
B−1
A=S +N (43)
where Sis diagonalizable, Nis nilpotent, and [ S, N] = 0.
This decomposition always exists and is unique. It was
shown in the proof of Prop. 20 of Ref. 45 that Shas rank
one. It follows that Stakes the form
S =λW V (44)forV:CD→CχandW:Cχ→CD. Ref. 45 showed
thatVandWsatisfy V W =1χ×χand (39). Such a pair
is thus a reduction from AtoB.
It is important to note that, while Sis determined
uniquely from the decomposition of TAB, the choice of
VandWis uniquely determined only up to a complex
scalar z∈C×, as we could have replaced
V→z−1V, W →zW . (45)
We will call Saprojective reduction since it defines a
reduction up to a complex scalar as in (45). Let PRχ(D)
denote the space of projective ( χ, D)-reductions; this is
the space Rχ(D) quotiented by the action (45).
There is an obvious projection map Rχ(D)→
PRχ(D), sending a reduction to its equivalence class un-
der (45). The action is free and transitive on the fibers
and the map is in fact a principal C×-bundle. The bun-
dle captures the C×ambiguity associated to choosing a
reduction V,Wgiven S.
Now, we return to the case where we have a
parametrized family of MPS. Suppose that for each x∈
Uabwe have continuous MPS tensors A(x), B(x) repre-
senting the same state, with bond dimensions DAand
DB, respectively. Suppose that B(x) is injective for each
x∈Uab. Let D=DAandχ=DB. While it is clear that
the construction outlined above can be applied pointwise
forx∈Uab, we argue that the procedure can in fact be
done continuously.
It is obvious that the Moore-Penrose inverse B−1(x) =
(B†B)−1B†and the tensor TAB(x) =B−1Aare continu-
ous if AandBare. We argue that the Jordan-Chevalley
decomposition of TAB(x) =S(x) +N(x) is also contin-
uous when S(x) is fixed to be rank one. It is generally
true that SandNcan be written as polynomials of TAB;
it is then sufficient to show that the coefficients of the
polynomial depend continuously on TAB.
Consider the direct sum decomposition of CχD=L
iViinto generalized eigenspaces of TAB. By construc-
tion, Sacts via scalar multiplication cion each subspace.
By assumption, Sis rank one, so only a single ci=c
is nonzero, and its corresponding eigenspace Viis one-
dimensional. This fixes the form of Sto be
S=c0
00
in a basis which respects the eigenspace decomposition.

where Jis an upper triangular and nilpotent ( χD−1)×

soS= (1/cχD−2)TχD−1
AB . Recall that cis the unique
nonzero eigenvalue of TAB, which varies continuously
withTAB, soSis a continuous function of TAB.
As a result, given continuous A(x) and a continuous
injective B(x), we can obtain a continuous family of pro-
jective reductions S(x). In other words, we obtain a map
SAB:Uab→PRχ(D) (46)
into the space of projective reductions. Recall that the
space of reductions Rχ(D) forms a C×-bundle over the
space of projective reductions PRχ(D). Pulling back this
C×-bundle along SABgives a C×-bundle over Uab.
C. Gerbe from Chern number pump
We have now developed enough machinery to describe
how to construct a gerbe from the Chern number pump.
This will make precise the observation made at the end
of Sec. IV.
As discussed in Sec. IV, the Chern number pump is a
d= 1 system over S3with MPS tensors Aij
N(29) and Aij
S
(31) which represent the ground state and are defined on
the open sets UN⊂S3andUS⊂S3, respectively. The
tensor Aij
Sis injective everywhere, while Aij
Nis not injec-
tive on UNS=UN∩US. We will construct a principal
C×-bundle on UNS, which defines a gerbe on S3.51Since
there are no triple overlaps, there are no extra data or
conditions needed to specify the gerbe. This is an in-
stance of the clutching construction.
The Moore-Penrose inverse of Aij
Sis given by
(Aij

which reproduces the choice of reduction VandWused
in (34). As discussed in Sec. V B, this defines a map
UNS→PR1(2)≃Gr1(C2) =CP1=S2.
We show in Appendix A that the space PR1(2)≃
Gr1(C2). The canonical C×-bundle over Gr1(C2) is the
Hopf bundle C2\0→S2with Chern number 1. The
pullback yields a bundle over UNSwith Chern number 1.
The nontriviality of this bundle indicates that the gerbe
overS3is nontrivial; moreover, because the Chern num-
ber is unity, the Dixmier-Douady class is a generator of
H3(S3,Z).48The above calculation shows that the Chern number
pump captures a non-torsion class in H3(S3,Z). Phys-
ically, this means that stacking the system any number
of times will never lead to a trivial system. As argued in
Sec. III, a non-torsion class in H3(S3,Z) can never be
captured by a system of MPS where the injective bond
dimension is the same everywhere. This leads to the in-
teresting conclusion that there is no way to continuously
deform the family of Hamiltonians in Eq. 15 while pre-
serving the gap such that the injective bond dimension
takes the same value for all system parameters.
D. Gerbe from MPS family
We now generalize the construction to more generic
families of MPS. We begin with a continuous family of
states ω:X→Q, where for each x∈Xthe state
ω(x) can be represented by an injective MPS tensor of
bond dimension χω(x). Note that χω(x)is not generally
a continuous function of x. We take an open cover {Ua}
ofXand assume the existence of continuous functions
A:Ua→CnD2
A
x7→A(x)(49)
such that A(x) represents the state ω(x), where nis
the dimension of the physical on-site Hilbert space and
DAis the bond dimension of the MPS representation
onUa. The MPS tensor A(x) is not necessarily injec-
tive. Moreover, on each double overlap Uab=Ua∩Ub,
the restrictions of the above data give two functions
A:Uab→CnD2
AandB:Uab→CnD2
B. In order to
compare them, we assume the existence of a continuous
function K:Uab→Cnχ2, so that K(x) is injective of
constant bond dimension χand represents ω(x) for each
x∈Uab.53Note that this means we assume the cover
is chosen so that χω(x)is constant on double overlaps.
The existence of the function Kis a property of the data
{(Ua, A)}, but we do not consider Kitself as data; dif-
ferent choices of Kare possible and the choice will not
matter.
To define a gerbe we need to construct a C×-bundle on
each double overlap of the cover. On Uab, there are two
tensors A(x) and B(x) as described above. Let us first
consider the simplifying case where one of the tensors, say
B, is injective with constant bond dimension χ=DBon
Uab. Then, using the method described in Section V B,
we obtain a continuous map
SAB:Uab→PRχ(DA)
x7→SAB(x)(50)
describing the reduction of A(x) toB(x) up to a com-
plex scalar. Pulling back the C×-bundle Rχ(DA)→
PRχ(DA) along SAByields a C×-bundle PABoverUab.
TheC×-bundle PABkeeps track of the C×phase of the
reduction ( V, W ).13
To proceed in the case where neither AnorBare in-
jective, we first introduce the idea of a reduction step
between two reductions. To do this we leave the set-
ting of parametrized families for a moment and consider
fixed ( i.e.non-parametrized) MPS tensors A,BandK
all representing the same state, with Kinjective. Let
RA= (VA, WA) and RB= (VB, WB) be reductions from
AtoKandBtoKrespectively. We’d like to con-
sider all such pairs ( RA, RB), but they depend on the
auxillary injective tensor K. We would like to get rid
of this dependence. To do this, note that, given an-
other injective tensor K′representing the same state,
the fundamental theorem of MPS says K′=λM−1KM
for some invertible M∈GL(χ) and λas in (8). From
(39) it follows that changing the reference injective ten-
sorK7→K′=λM−1KM modifies the pair ( RA, RB)
as
VA→M−1VA, WA→WAM
VB→M−1VB, WB→WBM.(51)
To compare AandBwhen neither AnorBis assumed
to be injective, we quotient out by this dependence. We
define an equivalence relation as follows: pairs ( RA, RB)
and ( R′
A, R′
B) are equivalent if
V′
A=M−1VA, W′
A=WAM
V′
B=M−1VB, W′
B=WBM(52)
for an M∈GL(χ). A reduction step from AtoBis an
equivalence class of such pairs. We denote the equiva-
lence class by [ RA, RB].
This motivates the definition of a space of reduction
steps. Let χ≤D, D′. Consider the product
Rχ(D)× R χ(D′). (53)
The space of (χ, D, D′)-reduction steps , denoted
Rχ(D, D′), is then the quotient of Rχ(D)× R χ(D′)
by the diagonal right action ( R, R′)7→(RM, R′M) for
M∈GL(χ), given explicitly by
((V, W ),(V′, W′))7→((M−1V, WM ),(M−1V′, W′M)).
(54)
Compare with (51). We will denote elements of
Rχ(D, D′) by a pair [ R, R′], with the square bracket de-
noting quotient by the action (54).
There is a C×action on Rχ(D, D′) which is given by
[R, R′]→[zR, R′] (55)
where R→zRacts as in (45). This is the descendant of
theC×action on the left factor of Rχ(D)× R χ(D′); the
diagonal C×action is a subgroup of the diagonal GL(χ)
action which was quotiented out in (52).
LetPRχ(D, D′) be the quotient of Rχ(D, D′) by this
C×action. This C×action is free and transitive on
the fibers of PRχ(D, D′). In fact, the quotient map
Rχ(D, D′)→PRχ(D, D′) is a principal C×-bundle. Wewill denote elements of PRχ(D, D′) by a pair JR, R′K.
The double bracket denotes a quotient of [ R, R′] by the
C×action (55).
Observe that there is a continuous map
q:PRχ(D)×PRχ(D′)→PRχ(D, D′)
(S, S′)7→JR, R′K(56)
where S(S′) is the projective reduction corresponding
to the reduction R(R′). This is well-defined since the
C×-actions on both the right and left Rχ(D) factors in
(53) have been quotiented out. In particular, JR, R′K=
JzR, z′R′K.
Now, we are ready to return to parametrized MPS.
Again, suppose we have A(x) and B(x) defined over Ua
andUbrespectively, with K(x) injective defined on Uab.
As described above, we get continuous functions
SAK:Uab→PRχ(DA)
SBK:Uab→PRχ(DB).(57)
These combine to give continuous maps
Uab→PRχ(DA)×PRχ(DB)
x7→(SAK(x), SBK(x))(58)
which we can then compose with qin (56) to obtain a
continuous map
gab:Uab→PRχ(DA, DB)
x7→JRA, RBK. (59)
This is independent of our choice of the auxilary injective
tensor Kwe used to define it. Indeed, given another
continuous injective K′giving rise to a map g′
ab, for each
x∈Uabthere exists M(x)∈GL(χ) and λ(x)∈C×with
the property K′(x) =λ(x)M(x)−1K(x)M(x). The maps
gabandg′
abare equal since
gab(x) = JRA, RBK
=JRAM, R BMK
=JR′
A, R′
BK=g′
ab(x).(60)
This then defines a C×-bundle on Uabby the pullback
of the C×-bundle Rχ(DA, DB)→PRχ(DA, DB). We
denote the resulting bundle over UabbyPAB.
Let us make a comment on the interpretation of the
bundle PAB. Recall that in the case where Bis injec-
tive, we obtain a reduction R= (V, W ) up to a phase
(45). The role of the C×-bundle PABis that it keeps
track of the phase of W. In the general case, we have a
reduction step [ RA, RB] up to a phase (55). The role of
PABis to keep track of the phase of the matrix WAVB.
Note that the matrix WAVBis independent of the injec-
tive reference tensor Kused to define it. Under the C×
action (55), the matrix transforms as WAVB→zWAVB;
compare with the transformation of Win (45).
At this stage, it is useful to see how the resulting bun-
dle reproduces the earlier construction when one of the14
MPS tensors (say B) is injective. Picking for the moment
an injective reference tensor K, the construction gives a
projective reduction step JRA, RBK. Since Bis injec-
tive, the reduction RBfrom BtoKis simply a gauge
transformation VBBW B=Kwith WB=V−1
B. Follow-
ing (60), we can choose an alternative reference tensor
K′=B=V−1
BKVB, which gives
JRA, RBK=JRAVB, RBVBK
=JRAB,1K(61)
where RAB=RAVB= (V−1
BVA, WAVB). But RABis
precisely the reduction from AtoB, since
(V−1
BVA)A(WAVB) =V−1
BKVB=B. (62)
The projective reduction step JRAB,1Kcan therefore be
identified with the projective reduction SABin the injec-
tive case. Similarly, the reduction step [ RA, RB] can be
identified with the reduction ( V, W ) from AtoB.
Having defined a C×-bundle PABon double overlaps
Uab, the next piece of data required to define a gerbe
is the product, θabc:PAB⊗ P BC→ P ACover triple
intersections Uabc. Roughly, the product can be de-
scribed as follows. Given [ RA, RB] inRχ(DA, DB) and
[R′
B, R′
C] inRχ(DB, DC) which are in the same fiber so
that R′
B=zRBfor some z∈C×, we have
θabc([RA, RB],[R′
B, R′
C]) = [ zRA, R′
C]. (63)
More formally, for any injective Kdefined on Uab, there
is a canonical isomorphism
PAK⊗ P−1
BK∼=− → P AB, (64)
where P−1
BKdenotes the inverse C×-bundle. It is impor-
tant to note that this expression only makes sense on
double intersections since Kis not defined on elements
of the cover itself. Choose an injective tensor Kon the
triple intersection Uabc. Then (64) holds for the restric-
tions of PAB,PBCandPAConUabc. The isomorphism
θabcis the composite
PAB⊗ PBC∼=− → P AK⊗ P−1
BK⊗ PBK⊗ P−1
CK
∼=− → P AK⊗ P−1
CK
∼=− → P AC.(65)
Associativity is obvious from the definition of θabc.
This finishes the construction of the gerbe Passociated
to a family of MPS. It follows that we get an associated
cohomology class
d(P)∈H3(X,Z). (66)
A nontrivial Dixmier-Douady class for the MPS gerbe
Pimplies that it is impossible to have an MPS tensor
representing the parametrized family of states which is
continuous and defined everywhere on X. Indeed, if sucha global continuous MPS tensor exists, all of the tran-
sition line bundles can be chosen to be trivial, and the
resulting gerbe is trivial. This statement makes no men-
tion of whether the MPS tensor is injective everywhere.
This shows, for instance, that in the Chern number pump
there is no way to extend the bond dimension D= 2 MPS
tensor valid on the northern hemisphere to one defined
globally and continuously over S3. Thus, even relaxing
the condition of injectivity does not allow for a global
continuous MPS tensor.
We have mostly been ignoring the H2(X,Z) invariant
discussed in Sec. III; we now briefly comment on how to
recover it for the more general MPS families discussed in
this section. As explained in Sec. III, in the case of MPS
families where the injective bond dimension χis constant
overX, one has a principal C××PGL (χ)-bundle. From
this one gets a C×-bundle, of which the H2(X,Z) invari-
ant is the first Chern class.
In the present case, we can also construct transition
functions on double overlaps hab:Uab→C×, from the
tensors A(x) and B(x) defined on Uab. In the case where
B(x) is injective, the projective reduction SABdeter-
mines a continuous λAB:Uab→C×by (39). We take
hab=λAB. In the more general case where neither Anor
Bis necessarily injective, we have projective reductions
SAKandSBKfor a continuous injective tensor Kdefined
onUab, which give continuous maps λAK:Uab→C×
andλBK:Uab→C×, respectively. In this case we let
hab=λAKλ−1
BK. These transition functions clearly sat-
isfy the cocycle condition on triple overlaps. Moreover, in
the case of constant injective bond dimension, we recover
theC×-bundle discussed in Sec. III.
E. Injective MPS families
In this section, we explore what happens if for every
element Uaof the cover, the MPS tensor
A:Ua→CnD2
a (67)
is injective for all x∈Ua. Assuming that Xis connected,
it follows that Da=χindependent of a,i.e.all the ten-
sors have the same bond dimension χ. We will call such
families of states injective MPS families . As discussed in
Sec. III, injective MPS families give rise to a PGL (χ)-
bundle. We show that the lifting gerbe of this bundle
reproduces the same invariant as our construction of a
MPS gerbe.
Let us first argue that, as an intermediate step in con-
structing the gerbe, we reproduce the PGL (χ)-bundle
structure. On double overlaps Uab, we construct projec-
tive reductions SABfrom AtoB. The space of projective
reductions is PRχ(χ) =PGL (χ). Since both AandB
are injective, the reduction is in fact a gauge transforma-
tionλW−1
ABAWAB=B, which by the fundamental the-
orem of MPS is unique up to a scalar multiple of WAB.
Uniqueness then implies that on triple overlaps Uabc, the15
MPS tensors A,B, and Care related by
λ′W−1
BCλW−1
ABAWAB|{z}
BWBC=λλ′W−1
ACAWAC=C(68)
so [WAC] = [ WABWBC], where the square bracket de-
notes quotient by an overall phase. This is precisely the
cocycle condition for the PGL (χ)-valued transition func-
tions, so the injective MPS family defines a PGL (χ)-
bundle.
The construction of the gerbe proceeds by pulling back
the bundle GL(χ)→PGL (χ). We then obtain line bun-
dlesPABon double overlaps Uab. The product on the
gerbe is given by (63); let us unpack the definition for
the injective MPS family. Elements of PABare gauge
transformations ( W−1
AB, WAB) from AtoB; similarly el-
ements of PBCare gauge transformations ( W−1
BC, WBC)
from BtoC. As reduction steps, the gauge transforma-
tions are
WAB→[RAB,1]
WBC→[RBC,1] = [1 , RCB](69)
Applying (63) gives
θabc([RAB,1],[1, RCB]) = [ RAB, RCB]
= [RABWBC,1]
= [(W−1
BCW−1
AB, WABWBC),1]
→WABWBC.
(70)
In terms of the original gauge transformations, then, we
have θabc(WAB, WBC) =WABWBC, which is just ordi-
nary matrix multiplication.
We can understand the Dixmier-Douady class of this
gerbe as follows. Suppose we started with a good cover so
that all double intersections Uabare contractible. Then
we can choose local sections WAB:Uab→GL(χ). Then
the class gabcis given by
WABWBC=gabcWAC (71)
If the class is trivial, then an appropriate choice of local
sections WABsatisfies WABWBC=WAC; this defines a
lift of the PGL (χ)-bundle to a GL(χ)-bundle. On the
other hand, a nontrivial class represents an obstruction
to such a lifting. This kind of gerbe is often referred to
as a lifting gerbe. Note the similarity to the physics of
d= 1 SPTs, where SPTs with G-symmetry are classi-
fied by projective representations of G. The projective
representation is a homomorphism G→PGL (χ), and
for nontrivial SPTs there is an obstruction to lifting to a
homomorphism to GL(χ).34
The Dixmier-Douady class of the lifting gerbe of a
PGL (χ)-bundle is known to be torsion in H3(X,Z). In-
jective MPS families thus provide classes of parametrized
systems which are invisible to the invariant obtained by
integrating the higher Berry curvature, which cannot de-
tect torsion elements of H3(X,Z).VI. NONTRIVIAL FAMILY OF INJECTIVE
MPS
In this section we use the suspension construction of
Ref. 24 to construct a family of Hamiltonians whose
ground states admit injective MPS representations with
constant bond dimension χ= 2. We determine that this
family is nontrivial by studying the resulting PGL (2)-
bundle, which has a nonzero Dixmier Douady class.
Consider a d= 1 lattice with two qubits per site,
using the same notation for sites and Pauli operators
as in Sec. IV. We choose the parameter space to be
X=RP2×S1. We parameterize Xby pairs ([ˆ n], t),
where [ˆ n] are equivalence classes of unit vectors in R3,
with ˆ n∼ −ˆn. The circle S1is parameterized by twhich
takes values in interval [ −1,1] with endpoints identified.
To define the parametrized system, it will be useful to
begin with a reference Hamiltonian H([ˆn]) and a family
of unitaries U([ˆn], t). The family of Hamiltonians will be
H([ˆn], t) =U([ˆn], t)H([ˆn])U†([ˆn], t). (72)
The reference Hamiltonian is
H([ˆn]) =X
i∈Z2(ˆn·⃗ σi,a)(ˆn·⃗ σi,b)−⃗ σi,a·⃗ σi,b, (73)
which is a sum of single-site terms and is easily seen to be
gapped. Each single-site Hamiltonian specifies a gapped
d= 0 system over RP2, describing the m= 0 state of a
spin-1 particle in a Zeeman field along ˆ n, where the spin-
1 Hilbert space is realized as a subspace of two qubits.
This d= 0 system was studied by Robbins and Berry,54
where they point out that the family of states over RP2is
nontrivial. The nontriviality lies in the −1 Berry phase
coming from parallel transport along a noncontractible
cycle in RP2.
Accordingly, the unique ground state of the reference
Hamiltonian is a product state where each site is in the
S= 1 state of two spin-1 /2 particles with m= 0 along
the ˆnaxis,
|Ψ[ˆn](t= 0)⟩=O
i
U(ˆn)⊗U(ˆn) 
|↑↓⟩+|↓↑⟩√
2!
=O
iU U
σx
=O
i˜σx.
(74)
Here U(ˆn) is the rotation matrix given by (24). In the
third equality we “pushed” U(ˆn) from the second qubit
to the first and defined ˜ σx=U(ˆn)σxUT(ˆn). It can be
checked that ˜ σxis a well-defined function of ˆ n, but it
isnota well-defined function of [ˆ n]. Rather, we have
˜σx→ − ˜σxwhen ˆ n→ − ˆn. This is to be expected, since
the fact that the wavefunction changes sign upon ˆ n→ −ˆn16
indicates the nontriviality of the 0 dsystem over RP2.
Note that the state of the d= 1 system remains un-
changed under ˆ n→ −ˆn, since at most this only changes
the overall phase of the wave function.
We now turn to the definition of U([ˆn], t). The full
unitary takes the form
U([ˆn], t) =(
U+([ˆn], t)t≥0
U−([ˆn], t)t≤0. (75)
We build the unitaries U+andU−out of local gates Ui,i+1
defined by
Ui,i+1([ˆn], t) = exp
iπ
2t 
1−(ˆn·⃗ σi,b)(ˆn·⃗ σi+1,a)
.(76)
The gate Ui,i+1interpolates between the identity at t= 0
and (ˆ n·⃗ σi,b)(ˆn·⃗ σi+1,a) att=±1. The unitaries U+and
U−are products of Ui,i+1acting on the even and odd
bonds, respectively:
U+([ˆn], t) =Y
ievenUi,i+1([ˆn], t)
U−([ˆn], t) =Y
ioddUi,i+1([ˆn], t).(77)
Both the reference Hamiltonian and U([ˆn], t) are invari-
ant under ˆ n→ − ˆn, and thus are well-defined functions
of [ˆn]. Moreover, it can be checked that H([ˆn], t= 1) =
H([ˆn], t=−1), so the full Hamiltonian H([ˆn], t) is well-
defined over RP2×S1. While H([ˆn], t) can be explicitly
evaluated using (72), (75), (76), (77), its precise form is
not very illuminating. The exception is at t=±1, where
H([ˆn], t=±1) =X
i∈Z⃗ σi,a·⃗ σi,b, (78)
which is independent of ˆ n. The family of unitaries (77)
is constructed so that H([ˆn], t) interpolates between the
reference Hamiltonian (73) and (78).
The ground state over RP2×S1is given in terms of
thet= 0 ground state (74) by
|Ψ[ˆn](t) =U([ˆn], t)|Ψ[ˆn](t= 0)⟩. (79)
Because both the state and the unitaries factorize as ten-
sor products, we have
|Ψ[ˆn](t)⟩=O
ievenUi,i+1([ˆn], t)|ψ[ˆn]⟩i|ψ[ˆn]⟩i+1
=
˜σx˜σx˜σx˜σxU U(80)
fort≥0, and
|Ψ[ˆn](t)⟩=O
ioddUi,i+1([ˆn], t)|ψ[ˆn]⟩i|ψ[ˆn]⟩i+1
=
˜σx˜σx˜σx˜σxU U U(81)fort≤0. We have depicted the state diagrammat-
ically with a system size of four unit cells with peri-
odic boundary conditions; in Eq. 81 the two U’s at the
edges represent two halves of a single operator. Using
Ui,i+1([ˆn], t=±1) = (ˆ n·⃗ σi,b)(ˆn·⃗ σi+1,a), it can be shown
that at t=±1 the state becomes
|Ψ[ˆn](t=±1)⟩=O
i 
|↑↓⟩ − |↓↑⟩√
2!
i
=O
i−iσy(82)
so each site hosts a singlet state on two qubits. Note
that both the Hamiltonian (78) and the state (82) at t=
±1 are independent of [ˆ n] and therefore are continuous
everywhere.
The description in terms of MPS follows from the di-
agrammatic representation of the ground state. The
Hamiltonian is translation invariant with four spins per
unit cell, so the MPS tensor must have four physical in-
dices. For a particular choice of unit cell, we “cut” the
states (80) and (81) to obtain the MPS tensor,
A0= U
˜σx˜σx(83)
fort≥0 and
A0= U
˜σx˜σx(84)
fort≤0. Note that we have made a somewhat unusual
choice of unit cell by cutting the state in between the a
andbsublattices of a site. This choice is made so that
the MPS has bond dimension χ= 2 everywhere and is
injective.
The MPS tensor is well-defined and continuous away
from t=±1 but suffers a discontinuity at t=±1. In
other words, it is well-defined on the open set U0=RP2×
(S1\ ±1). To see this, consider approaching t→1 from
the positive side. After some algebra, A0becomes
A0(t→1) =
iσy˜σxˆn·⃗ σ. (85)
Note that this expression depends on [ˆ n], while the state
does not. On the other hand, as t→ −1 from the nega-
tive side, A0becomes
A0(t→ −1) =
−iσyiσy(86)
which is independent of [ˆ n]. These tensors are related by
a gauge transformation
Aijkl
0(t→ −1) = (ˆ n·⃗ σ)TAijkl
0(t→1)(ˆn·⃗ σ)T.(87)17
Note that (ˆ n·⃗ σ)T= [(ˆn·⃗ σ)T]−1, so this is a valid gauge
transformation. Using this gauge transformation, one
can construct a MPS tensor A1which is well-defined and
continuous at t=±1. We define A1on the region t >0
to be
Aijkl
1= (ˆn·⃗ σ)TAijkl
0(ˆn·⃗ σ)T(88)
such that,
A1=
(ˆn·σ)TU
˜σx−iσy(89)
while we set A1=A0when t <0. By construction, A1is
well-defined and continuous everywhere away from t= 0;
it is an MPS tensor on the open set U1=RP2×(S1\0).
Let us now show that this defines a nontrivial PGL (2)-
bundle over RP2×S1whose lifting gerbe is nontrivial.
The overlap U01=U0∩U1includes and is homotopy
equivalent to RP2×S0,i.e.two disjoint copies of RP2.
In the region −1< t < 0, the transition function is trivial
since A1=A0. In the region 0 < t < 1, the transition
function is given by the gauge transformation used to
define A1. Explicitly, we have
g01:RP2×(0,1)→PGL (2)
([ˆn], t)7→[(ˆn·⃗ σ)T](90)
where the square bracket indicates that we should quo-
tient by C×scalar multiples. This map defines a non-
trivial C×-bundle over RP2×(0,1), which can be seen
in the following way. Using the operator-state correson-
dence (10), we can interpret g01as a family of states
g01([ˆn], t) =
(1⊗ˆn·⃗ σ)|Φ+⟩
(91)
where the square brackets again represent a quotient by
the phase. We can apply the Robbins-Berry argument54
to this family of states to show that it is a nontrivial fam-
ily over RP2. The Berry curvature associated to this fam-
ily of states vanishes, and the wavefunction ( 1⊗ˆn·⃗ σ)|Φ+⟩
picks up a −1 phase from parallel transport along a non-
trivial cycle in RP2(i.e.a path from ˆ nto−ˆn). This
implies that the family of states over RP2is nontriv-
ial, which shows that the map g01gives a nontrivial C×-
bundle. We therefore obtain a nontrivial gerbe over X.
Since H3(RP2×S1,Z)∼=Z2, we have constructed the
gerbe with unique nontrivial Dixmier-Douady class.
VII. HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL
GENERALIZATIONS
It is natural to ask whether the MPS gerbe for d= 1
systems can be generalized to parametrized systems in
higher dimensions. Focusing on the expected Hd+2(X,Z)
invariant of such systems, we would like to identify a
geometrical object giving rise to a class in Hd+2(X,Z).A natural option is a d-gerbe,38which encompasses line
bundles (0-gerbes) and gerbes (1-gerbes). Here, we out-
line how higher-dimensional tensor networks should lead
to ad-gerbe. Since tensor networks in higher dimensions
lack the same rigid structure of MPS, our analysis will be
less rigorous than above. Rather, we will give a heuris-
tic description of the general idea along with an explicit
example for d= 2.
A. 2-gerbe in 2-dimensional systems via PEPS
The higher-dimensional generalization of MPS is given
by projected entangled pair states (PEPS). In two di-
mensions, a PEPS on a square lattice is defined by a
5-index tensor Ai
αβγδ which is then contracted into an
L×Llattice as shown below for L= 3,
|ψ(A)⟩=
AAA
AAA
AAA
(92)
where we take periodic boundaries, such that the open
legs at the top and bottom (left and right) are con-
tracted as indicated by the bent legs. In this diagram,
and throughout this section, diagonally oriented legs will
always correspond to physical degrees of freedom while
vertical/horizontally oriented legs will correspond to vir-
tual (contracted) bonds of the tensor network. By block-
ing the tensors of the PEPS into columns, we can get a
quasi-1D MPS description of the system in terms of the
column tensor A(L)defined as,
A(L)=
AAA
(93)
Similar to the case of MPS, there is redundancy in the
PEPS description of a wavefunction. However, in the
case of PEPS, the form of this redundancy depends
strongly on the assumptions we make about the PEPS
tensor itself, and a general understanding of the redun-
dancy without assuming any properties of the tensor is
known to be unattainable55. Let us suppose that our
PEPS has the property that the column tensor A(L)is
normal for all L. Then, given any other column tensor
B(L)representing the same state, Eq. 39 tells us that
there are matrices V(L)andW(L)and a non-zero com-
plex number λ(L)such that λ(L)V(L)B(L)W(L)=A(L)18
andV(L)W(L)=1for all L. Graphically,
AAA
=λ(L)
V(L)W(L)
BBB
(94)
The reductions V(L)andW(L)depend on L, and there-
fore their properties in the large- Llimit are not clear.
However, in certain cases, which we describe shortly, the
reductions can themselves be written as tensor networks,
V(L)=
VVV
(95)
and similarly for W(L), where the tensor Vis independent
ofL. The bond dimension of Vis in general different
from that of AorB, so we color it red. We call this
a matrix product operator (MPO) representation of the
operator V(L). Note that any MPO can be considered
an MPS by simply flipping some of the legs of the tensor
(see Eq. 10). We can define a normal MPO tensor as
one whose corresponding MPS tensor is normal. In the
cases of interest, V(L)can be represented by an normal
MPO tensor. Therefore, as in the case of MPS, there is
a redundancy in the choice of normal tensors Vwhich
represent V(L).
Now, we can follow the logic used to derive the MPS
gerbe in the previous sections. Suppose we have an open
cover{Ua}ofXand a continuous family of PEPS ten-
sors defined on each open set. Then, at the double over-
laps Uab=Ua∩Ub, there will be two PEPS tensors
A(x) and B(x). We further suppose the column tensor
A(L)(x) is normal for every L. Then, for every x∈Uab,
we can relate the two associated column tensors A(L)(x)
andB(L)(x) via a reduction given by a pair of operators
V(L)(x)andW(L)(x), which can be regarded as a injec-
tive MPS. Therefore, we have a injective MPS defined at
every point x∈Uabwhich, by the results of the previous
sections, means there is a gerbe defined at every double
overlap. This is the essential ingredient in the definition
of a 2-gerbe,38which also includes other data and con-
ditions involving higher overlaps. This strongly suggests
that a family of PEPS, subject to certain constraints on
their structure which make Eqs. 94 and 95 valid, gives
rise to a 2-gerbe. Topologically inequivalent 2-gerbes are
classified by cohomology classes in H4(X,Z), which is
the desired invariant.
What remains is to understand the necessary con-
straints on the allowed PEPS tensors, similar to how werestricted to MPS that represent the same states as in-
jective MPS in the previous sections. This is challenging,
because, in contrast to MPS, we do not have a class of
PEPS that captures the kinds of systems we are inter-
ested in, while also admitting the necessary structure
theorems. Nevertheless, we can consider certain sub-
classes of PEPS for which the desired properties of re-
ductions can be proven rigorously, and which are suited
to representing short-range entangled states. One natu-
ral route is to consider injective PEPS, which are defined
similarly as injective MPS,56,57for which Eqs. 94 and
95 do hold. However, in this case, the reduction V(L)
is a tensor product of local operators, i.e.an MPO of
bond dimension 1. As bond dimension 1 is not suffi-
cient to support a non-trivial gerbe, we conclude that
injective PEPS are not sufficient to capture 2-gerbes. A
larger class of PEPS is the semi-injective PEPS defined in
Ref. 45, for which Eqs. 94 and 95 also hold, and the cor-
responding MPOs V(L)can have bond dimension greater
than 1. Indeed, the example we discuss in the next sec-
tion has an entangled plaquette structure that is very
reminiscent of semi-injective PEPS. The semi-injective
PEPS are also suited to describing invertible systems that
are the unique, gapped ground states of certain parent
Hamiltonians with periodic boundary conditions.45Con-
versely, PEPS representing simple non-invertible phases
such as quantum double models fall into the framework
ofG-injectivity,58for which the relations between two
PEPS generating the same state are more complex than
Eqs. 94 and 95. Therefore, the above observations do not
apply to non-invertible systems, as expected. We leave a
detailed investigation of the technical conditions needed
to rigorously derive the 2-gerbe structure of PEPS to fu-
ture work.
B. Two-dimensional example over X=S4
We now give an explicit example of a d= 2 system
overS4which realizes a non-trivial 2-gerbe as described
above. The Hamiltonian describing this system was in-
troduced in Ref. 24 and is defined in close analogy to
the 1D model over S3defined above. We consider a
two dimensional square lattice and take the parameter
space to be X=S4which can be parameterized as
w= (⃗ w, w 4, w5) with |⃗ w|2+w2
4+w2
5= 1. The family of
Hamiltonians is defined by
H2d(⃗ w, w 4, w5) =X
i∈2ZH1d(⃗ w, w 4) +X
i∈2Z+1¯H1d(⃗ w, w 4)
+X
i∈2ZH2,+
i(w5) +X
i∈2Z+1H2,−
i(w5),
(96)
where H1dis the d= 1 Hamiltonian defined in Eq. 15,
and ¯H1dis obtained from H1dby inverting the ⃗ wmag-
netic field term on every site. It was shown in Ref. 24
that H1dand ¯H1d, viewed as systems over S3by fixing
|⃗ w|2+w2
4, are inverses in the sense that they carry oppo-19
siteH3(S3,Z) invariants. These d= 1 Hamiltonians are
coupled by the remaining terms depending on w5,
H2,+
i(w5) =g+(w5)X
j∈Z⃗ σ(i,j)·⃗ σ(i+1,j)
H2,−
i(w5) =g−(w5)X
j∈Z⃗ σ(i−1,j)·⃗ σ(i,j). (97)
The functions g±(w5) are chosen to be
g+(w5) =(p
w2
5−1/4w5≥1/2
0 w5≤1/2(98)
and
g−(w5) =(
0 w5≥ −1/2p
w2
5−1/4w5≤ −1/2(99)
As before, for any value of w5, at most one of H2,+
i(w5)
orH2,−
i(w5) is nonzero. As a result, H2d(⃗ w, w 4, w5) is
a sum of decoupled one-dimensional Hamiltonians act-
ing on pairs of columns of spins, which furthermore de-
compose into interacting 4-spin clusters, as described in
Ref. 24. Using this, one can show that the ground state
ofH2dis gapped everywhere, and can be expressed ex-
actly as a PEPS of finite bond dimension. We note that
H2dis isotropic in the sense that it is invariant under 90◦
rotation followed by exchanging w4andw5.
Let us block sites of the d= 2 lattice into cells con-
sisting of pairs of columns. Then, similar to the d= 1
case, the entanglement between columns is either within
the unit cell or between the unit cells, depending on
the value of w5. Suppose we choose the unit cell such
that the columns within a unit cell are entangled for
w5<−1/2, and columns are entangled between neigh-
boring cells for w5>1/2. All columns are decoupled for
−1/2≤w5≤1/2. Then, we can represent the system
in the region USdefined by w5<1/2 with the following
column tensor,
A(L)
S=w5≥−1
2− − − − − → (100)
which has bond dimension 1 in the horizontal direction.
Therein we have introduced three new tensors. The four-
legged pill-shaped tensor generates the entangled ground
state of two coupled columns in of spins in H2d. Its pre-
cise form for all values of wis not important to us. What
matters is that (a) it is a continuous function of wand
(b) when w5≥ −1
2, the two halves of the column decou-
ple, as depicted. The three-legged filled circle and empty
circle tensors generate the d= 1 states |ψ1d⟩and|¯ψ1d⟩which are the ground states of H1dand¯H1d, respectively.
Because of (a), A(L)
Sis a continuous function over US.
For the region UNdefined by w5>−1/2, we can sim-
ilarly use the following continuous column tensor,
A(L)
N=w5≤1
2− − − − → (101)
which has bond dimension 2Lin the horizontal direc-
tion. Note that we have turned some of the physi-
cal (diagonally-directed) legs into virtual (horizontally-
directed) legs in order to facilitate entanglement between
unit cells, similar to Eq. 29. In the overlap region UN∩US
(i.e.−1
2< w 5<1
2), which is homotopy equivalent to
S3, we can obtain a reduction between the column ten-
sors defined in the two hemispheres. Namely, writing
V(L)=⟨ψ1d|andW(L)=|ψ1d⟩, we have,
V(L)A(L)
NW(L)= = =A(L)
S
(102)
where the contracted columns of filled circles represent
⟨ψ1d|ψ1d⟩= 1. Therefore, the reductions between PEPS
inUN∩USare exactly given by the ground states of the
d= 1 Hamiltonian from Eq. 15 which we demonstrated
realize a nontrivial gerbe over S3. This strongly suggests
that H2drealizes a non-trivial 2-gerbe. Indeed, the non-
trivial H4(X,Z) class of H2dwas demonstrated in Ref. 24
by other means.
C. Higher dimensions
The above discussion for d= 2 systems suggests
an inductive construction of higher gerbes for higher-
dimensional systems. Suppose we have a d-dimensional
system over Xand an open cover of X, where on each
open set we have a continuous d-dimensional tensor net-
work representation of the ground state. Now assume
that such a parametrized family gives rise to a d-gerbe,
as we have just argued is true for d= 2. Then going to
d+ 1 dimensions, under suitable assumptions, the space
of reductions between two ( d+1)-dimensional tensor net-
work representations on double overlaps is a space of d-
dimensional tensor networks, which by assumption de-
fines a d-gerbe, thus suggesting the structure of a ( d+1)-20
gerbe.38Inequivalent d-gerbes are classified by cohomol-
ogy classes in Hd+2(X,Z),38which indeed matches the
“within-cohomology” part of the expected classification
ofd-dimensional invertible systems.
As mentioned above, the space of reductions be-
tween higher dimensional tensor networks is not well-
understood for d > 1. Therefore, the above is only a
heuristic indication of the kinds of structures that should
be present in higher-dimensional tensor networks.
VIII. DISCUSSION
In this paper we construct a gerbe, a generalization
of a line bundle, associated to a family of d= 1 quan-
tum states over Xwhich can be represented pointwise by
an injective MPS tensor. To the gerbe we can associate
a class H3(X,Z) known as the Dixmier-Douady class,
which is expected to classify nontrivial parametrized sys-
tems in d= 1. Our work shows that this class also repre-
sents an obstruction to representing the family of states
with a continuous MPS tensor defined globally over X.
This is a natural analogue and extension of the story
ind= 0, where the Chern class of the ground state
line bundle classifies nontrivial parametrized phases and
represents an obstruction to making a global continuous
choice of the wave function. We also sketch the general-
ization to dimensions d≥2 using tensor networks, where
we expect that d-gerbes will play a central role.
Given the results of this paper, it is interesting to ask if
it is possible to construct a space of MPS-representable
statesQMPS that is a K(Z,3). Based in part on the
classification of symmetry protected topological phases
ind= 1, it is believed that the space Q1dof gapped
ground states of d= 1 local bosonic Hamiltonians is a
K(Z,3).30,31Roughly speaking, we might take QMPS⊂
Q1dto consist of states that can be represented by a
normal MPS tensor of any finite bond dimension, i.e.
QMPS =∪χ∈NMχ. All the nontrivial d= 1 examples
of parametrized systems in this paper can be realized as
maps into such a space, and we conjecture that any d= 1
parametrized phase has such a representative system. We
note that stabilization by stacking with a fixed trivial
system can be built into the construction of a space of
states within the approach of Ref. 25, so we expect it
should be possible to define a stable version of QMPS
along these lines.
However, the H2(X,Z) invariant capturing Chern
number per crystalline unit cell presents an issue. We ex-
pect this to be a phase invariant for translation-invariant
systems, so one option is simply to impose translation
symmetry, in which case we conjecture that QMPS con-
structed as outlined above is a K(Z,2)×K(Z,3). For
systems without translation symmetry, we expect it isnecessary to quotient out by decoupled d= 0 systems to
eliminate the H2(X,Z) invariant,59but at present it is
not clear how to incorporate this into the construction of
a space of states.
Our understanding of the relationship between gerbes
and parametrized d= 1 systems is by no means com-
plete. As mentioned in Sec. V, there are many differ-
ent equivalent formulations of gerbes — examples include
PU(H)-bundles, bundle gerbes, and line bundles on loop
space. It would be interesting to understand whether dif-
ferent formulations of gerbes offer different perspectives
on parametrized phases in d= 1.
Another important direction for future work is to for-
mulate the notion of a (higher) connection on the MPS
gerbe. One expects that the higher Berry curvature of
Kapustin and Spodyneiko should correspond to the cur-
vature of the gerbe connection. The gerbe connection
would provide an appropriate notion of parallel transport
and holonomy; it would be desirable for the holonomy to
be a “higher Berry phase” measurable by an interference
experiment. This would pave the way toward a better
physical understanding of the higher Berry curvature.
Finally, the use of tensor network methods in the
study of parametrized systems in d≥2 is likely to
be quite fruitful. In higher dimensions, the possibility
of parametrized families of topologically ordered states
arises. For example, there exist nontrivial families of toric
codes parametrized by S1, where the eandmanyons
are exchanged upon cycling the periodic parameter.14It
would be interesting to understand these and related phe-
nomena through the lens of tensor networks. Indeed, du-
alities such as the aforementioned e-mexchange are very
naturally described within the framework of PEPS.60
Note added : while this manuscript was being final-
ized for posting, we became aware of Ref. 61 that also
studies the gerbe structure in matrix product states of
one-dimensional systems.

1We also require that Hamiltonians in GHhave a unique
ground state in infinite space Rd. This removes any locii offirst-order phase transitions from GH. It should be noted21
that this requirement does not remove topologically or-
dered systems from GH; such systems only have a ground
state degeneracy when space is periodic.

22The Higher Berry curvature invariant of gapped families
overXcan only be identified with Hd+2(X,Z) for low di-
mensions. The map Hd+2(X,Z)→Ed+1(X) to the true
classification is neither injective nor surjective in general.
This is similar to the breakdown of the cohomology classi-
fication of SPT phases in higher dimensions.
23Condensed matter physics readers might find the state-
ment that different ground states do not lie in the same
Hilbert space perplexing; it is an under-appreciated math-
ematical fact. In condensed matter physics we often work
with finite systems and take the limit of a large system;
this is of course a very useful viewpoint but it does not pro-
vide a mathematical definition of the Hilbert space in the
limit. One might think it is possible to define the infinite-
system Hilbert space as an infinite tensor product, but
this turns out not to be mathematically sensible. Instead,
it is possible to use the technology of C⋆-algebras to work
directly with infinite systems, in which case the Hilbert
space is constructed from the ground state via the Gelfand-
Naimark-Segal construction. See Ref. 63 for an accessible
treatment.

27Ref. 24 more strictly reserved the term Chern number
pump for a closely related system over S2×S1, but the
essential physics of both systems is the same, so here we
use the term pumping somewhat more loosely.

59Naively, one might think the H2(X,Z) invariant simply
disappears without translation symmetry, but the situa-
tion is more subtle. For instance, consider two d= 1 sys-
tems over S2, with Chern number 0 and 1 per unit cell,
respectively. For sufficiently large finite systems with N
sites, the total Chern numbers will be 0 and N. Therefore,
for arbitrarily large but finite N, there is no way to deform
one system into the other without closing a gap somewhere
onS2.

Appendix A: The space of reductions
In this appendix we clarify some aspects of the space
of reductions Rχ(D) and projective reductions PRχ(D).
First recall that Vn(Cm) is the (non-compact) Stiefel
manifold, the space of n-frames in Cm, while Grn(Cm)
is the Grassmanian manifold, the space of n-dimensional
subspaces of Cm. The map Vn(Cm)→Grn(Cm) which
sends a frame to its span is a principal GL(n)-bundle.23
In order to describe this bundle more concretely, we
letGL(n, m−n) be the subgroup of GL(m) consisting
of upper block triangular matrices
"
X Z
0Y#
(A1)
with X∈GL(n) and Y∈GL(m−n). Let GL(In, m−n)
be the subgroup of GL(n, m−n) consisting of those upper
triangular matrices with Xequal to the n×nidentity
matrix.
One can check that there is an isomorphism of principal
GL(n)-bundles
GL(m)/GL(In, m−n)∼=//
Vn(Cm)

GL(m)/GL(n, m−n)∼=//Grn(Cm).
With this in mind, the space of ( χ, D)-reductions, de-
noted by Rχ(D), can be described in three equivalent
ways:
1. As the space of pairs ( V, W ) with V:CD→Cχ,
W:Cχ→CDsuch that V W =1χ×χ, topologized
as a subspace of L(CD,Cχ)× L(Cχ,CD) (where L
denotes the space of linear maps);
2. As the space of pairs ( w, T) consisting of a χ-frame
inCDand a subspace TofCDwith the property
that Span( w)⊕T=CD, topologized as a subspace
ofVχ(CD)×GrD−χ(CD);
3. As the coset space GL(D)/(Iχ×GL(D−χ)), for
GL(D) endowed with its canonical topology.
Let’s see why these are all the same. First, for 1. to
2., the action of Won the canonical χ-frame of Cχgives
theχ-frame w, and the kernel of Vgives the subspace
T. Going the other direction, given ( w, T) as in 2., let
Wto be the matrix which sends the canonical χ-frame
(e1, . . . ,eχ) ofCχtow, and let Vto be the matrix which
sends the χ-frame wto the canonical χ-frame of Cχ, and
sends elements of Tto zero. To see why 2. and 3. are
equivalent, consider the map which takes a matrix Min
GL(D) with columns m1, . . . , m Dto the pair
((m1, . . . , m χ),Span( mχ+1, . . . , m D)).
From these descriptions, we see that the space of
(χ, D)-reductions Rχ(D) is homotopy equivalent to
Vχ(CD); the equivalence is given by simply forgetting
the subspace T, or by letting Zgo to zero in (A1). We
thus have an equivalence of principal GL(χ)-bundles
R(d, D)≃//
Vχ(CD)

GL(D)/GL(χ)×GL(D−χ)≃ //Grχ(CD)The (right) action of GL(χ) onR(d, D) is given in our
three equivalent formulations, for U∈GL(χ), by

2. (w, T)7→(wU, T );
3.M7→M"
U 0
0ID−χ#
mod Iχ×GL(D−χ).
We can restrict the GL(χ) action on Rχ(D) to the
action of C×multiples of the identity. This endows the
space of reductions Rχ(D) with a C×action R7→zR
given by ( V, W )7→(z−1V, zW ). Compare with (45). In
the language of χ-frames, the action sends
(w1, . . . , w χ)→(zw1, . . . , zw χ). (A2)
Recall that PRχ(D) the quotient of Rχ(D) by the C×-
action (45). This quotient PRχ(D) is the space of reduc-
tions up to multiplication by a complex scalar, i.e., the
projective reductions. It is homotopy equivalent to the
projective Stiefel manifold PVχ(CD), which is Vχ(CD)
modulo the equivalence relation (A2); the equivalence
PRχ(D)≃− →PVχ(CD) (A3)
is again given by forgetting the subspace T. We then
have a diagram of principal C×-bundles
Rχ(D) //
Vχ(CD)
//V1(C∞)

PRχ(D)≃ //PVχ(CD) //PV1(C∞)
where every commuting square is a pull-back. The bot-
tom composite is the map
cχD:PRχ(D)→PV1(C∞) (A4)
which sends a projective reduction [ V, W ]∈PRχ(D) to
the span of the first column of Wviewed as a vector in
C∞by adding zeros beyond its Dth coordinate. The C×-
bundle Rχ(D)→PRχ(D) is the pull back of the bundle
V1(C∞)→PV1(C∞) along cχD.
We finish by commenting on what this means for our
constructions of Section V D of the bundles
PAB:Uab→ R χ(DA, DB) (A5)
in the case when neither AnorBis injective. Recall
that to construction PAB, we make use of an injective
tensor K:Uab→Cnχ2. Since pull-backs behave well
under composition, the intermediate bundle PAKcan be
constructed via the pull-back
Uab→PV1(C∞)
x7→[wA
1(x)](A6)24
for [VA, WA] a projective reduction step from AtoKand
[wA
1] the line spanned by the first column of
WA= [wA
1, . . . , wA
χ].
A similar formula holds for B.
LetV1(C∞)⊗V1(C∞) be the quotient of the space
V1(C∞)×V1(C∞) by the relation ( zv, w ) = ( v, zw ) for
v, w∈C∞andz∈C×. Then
V1(C∞)⊗V1(C∞)→PV1(C∞)×PV1(C∞),
v⊗w7→([v],[w])(A7)
is the universal tensor product of C×-bundles. The bun-
dlePABis the pull-back of this universal tensor product
bundle along
PAK⊗ P−1
BK:Uab→PV1(C∞)×PV1(C∞)
x7→([wA
1(x)],[wB
1(x)]).(A8)
where wB
1(x) is the complex conjugate of wB
1(x). So,
in all the data carried by the reductions, only the first
columns of WAandWBare necessary to construct the
line bundles PABover Uab. However, more was needed
to describe the gerbe product, as we saw above.
Appendix B: The space of injective MPS
We provide an elementary argument that the space
of states Mχrepresentable by injective MPS of bond
dimension χgives a model for the classifying space
B(C××PGL (χ)) in the limit where the onsite Hilbert
space dimension is allowed to be arbitrarily large.
A classifying space BGfor a group Gis the quotient of
a weakly contractible space EGby a proper free action of
G. For a fixed G, all (CW) models of BGare canonically
homotopy equivalent to each other, so any method of
obtaining BGis as good as any other.
Let us begin by considering the space of injective MPS,
which we will show is weakly contractible space with a
proper free C××PGL (χ) action. An injective MPS A
of bond dimension χis an injective map Mχ(C)→Cn
given by
M7→X
iTr (AiMT)|i⟩
where {|i⟩}is a basis for the on-site Hilbert space Cn. De-
note the space of all such injective maps by Vχ×χ(Cn).
We can embed CninCn+1by mapping |i⟩to itself, and
this gives inclusions Vχ×χ(Cn)⊂Vχ×χ(Cn+1) and, let-
tingn→ ∞ , we have
Vχ×χ(C∞) :=[
nVχ×χ(Cn). (B1)
But for any onsite dimension n, identifying Mχ(C) with
Cχ2, we get Vχ×χ(Cn)∼=Vχd(Cn),i.e., the space of χ2-
frames in Cn, which is the non-compact Stiefel manifold.It is known that in the limit n→ ∞ , this space is weakly
contractible.
TheC××PGL (χ) action of gauge transformations
translates as follows to an action on Vχ×χ(C∞). A pair
(λ, N) inC××PGL (χ) acts on an injective linear map
ϕvia the formula
((λ, N)ϕ)(M) =λϕ(NTM(NT)−1).
One can check that this is a proper free action on
Vχ×χ(C∞). Since the space Vχ×χ(C∞) is weakly con-
tractible, it qualifies as a E(C××PGL (χ)). Quoti-
enting by the C××PGL (χ) action yields the space
B(C××PGL (χ)), the classifying space of C××PGL (χ).
The fundamental theorem of injective MPS then allows
us to conclude that
Mχ=Vχ×χ(C∞)/(C××PGL (χ))
≃B(C××PGL (χ))
≃B(C×)×B(PGL (χ)).(B2)
Appendix C: The Brauer Group
LetXbe a finite CW-complex. We will assume X
is connected for simplicity of exposition, but this is not
necessary. Consider the map
H3(X,Z)→H3(X,R)
coming from the inclusion of ZintoR, which maps nto
2πn. The kernel of this map is the torsion subgroup of
H3(X,Z), which we will denote by Tor( H3(X,Z)). The
image is isomorphic to the quotient
Free( H3(X,Z)) := H3(X,Z)/Tor(H3(X,Z)).
This is the so-called “free part” of H3(X,Z). We have a
decomposition
H3(X,Z)∼=Tor(H3(X,Z))⊕Free( H3(X,Z)) (C1)
but we stress that this direct sum decomposition is not
unique in general: Free( H3(X,Z)) is not a subgroup of
H3(X,Z) in a unique way, one has to make choices to
write down (C1).
InH3(X,R), the image of Free( H3(X,Z)) is the sub-
group of cohomology classes which can be represented by
de Rham closed 3-forms with quantized integrals. Serre
(see Theorem 1.6 of Ref. 47) gives an identification of
Tor(H3(X,Z)) in terms that are relevant to the MPS
context. We describe this result here.
Let Alg( X) be the set of isomorphism classes of matrix
algebra bundles over X. That is, these are locally trivial
fiber bundles whose fibers are identified with Mχ(C) for
some χ≥1 and whose transition functions take values
in the automorphisms group of Mχ(C),i.e., inPGL (χ).
The dimension χof the fiber must be constant on con-
nected components, and so a matrix algebra bundle de-
termines a principal PGL (χ)-bundle on each component,25
and vice-versa. We have seen how to associate a class in
H3(X,Z) to a PGL (χ)-bundle, so we get a function
d: Alg( X)→H3(X,Z)
which associates to a matrix algebra bundle Eits
Dixmier-Douady class d(E). This is also called the lifting
gerbe .
There is a special class of matrix algebra bundles, those
that come from vector bundles. Given a non-zero vector
bundle V, we can associate the matrix algebra bundle
End( V) whose fibers are the endomorphisms of the fibers
ofV. Over a component of X, these correspond precisely
to those PGL (χ)-bundle that can be realized as GL(χ)-
bundles. But, the Dixmier-Douady class of these alge-
bra bundles is zero, i.e.,d(End( V)) = 0. So, from the
perspective of gerbes, elements of Alg( X) of the form
End( V) are trivial, and the class d(E) corresponding to
the lifting gerbe is the obstruction to realizing the alge-
bra bundle Eas the endomorphism bundle of a vector
bundle V.
This motivates the following construction. Define an
equivalence relation on Alg( X) byE≈Fif there exists
vector bundles VandWoverXsuch that
E⊗End( V)∼=F⊗End( W). (C2)
The Brauer group of X, denoted Br( X), is defined to bethe quotient Alg( X) by the relation ≈.
The tensor product of matrix algebras gives Alg( X)
the structure of a commutative monoid. After passing to
the quotient by ≈, one can show that this operation gives
the quotient Br( X) the structure of an abelian group.
The Dixmier-Douady class is a morphism of monoids,
d(E⊗F) =d(E) +d(F).
Since d(End( V)) = 0, E≈Fimplies d(E) =d(F). That
is, the Dixmier-Douady class induces a group homomor-
phism from Br( X) toH3(X,Z).
Serre proves that, in fact, the homomorphism induced
bydis an isomorphism of Br( X) onto the torsion sub-
group Tor( H3(X,Z)). So, there is a decomposition
H3(X,Z)∼=Br(X)⊕Free( H3(X,Z)).
Again, the subgroup Br( X) is uniquely defined, but
Free( H3(X,Z) depends on choices.
The relation (C2) is very similar to stacking stabiliza-
tion. Understanding precisely what it means for an in-
jective MPS to give rise to a GL(χ)-bundle, and thus
an element End( V) of Alg( X), and what (C2) means in
terms of passage to phases will be an essential step for un-
derstanding the precise relationship between MPS states
parametrized by XandH3(X,Z).
