SINGULARITIES
LUCAS LAVOYER
Abstract. We study the Ricci ﬂow out of spaces with edge type conical sin gularities along
a closed, embedded curve. Under the additional assumption t hat for each point of the curve,
our space is locally modelled on the product of a ﬁxed positiv ely curved cone and a line,
we show existence of a solution to Ricci ﬂow ( M,g(t)) fort∈(0,T],which converges back
to the singular space as tց0 in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorﬀ topology. We also prove
curvature estimates for the solution and, for edge points, w e show that the tangent ﬂow at
these points is a positively curved expanding Ricci soliton solution crossed with a line.
1.Introduction
Givenasmooth, closedmanifold MandaRiemannianmetric g0,Hamilton[ Ham82]showed
there is a family of metrics g(t), t∈[0,T),satisfying the Ricci ﬂow equation:
∂tg(t) =−2Ric(g(t)), (1)
withg(0) =g0.The existence time for this solution is bounded from below by the inverse
of the maximum of the Riemannian curvature at time t= 0 multiplied by a dimensional
constant.
In recent years, the question of starting Ricci ﬂow from non- smooth spaces has been of
great interest. The idea is that the regularising propertie s of Ricci ﬂow will in some sense
smooth out such spaces. In general, this is not a simple task, but results have been obtained
in some particular cases. In dimension two, substantial adv ances have already been made
in, for instance, the work of Giesen–Topping [ GT11] showing that given any Riemannian
surface, which may be incomplete and of unbounded curvature at spatial inﬁnity, there exists
a solution to Ricci ﬂow that is instantaneously complete for t>0.Later on, Topping [ Top15]
proved the solution is also unique, and, recently, Topping a nd Yin [ TY21] showed there is
a solution to Ricci ﬂow starting from Radon measures in 2D. In 3-D, Simon and Topping
[ST21] used Ricci ﬂow to show that any non-collapsed Ricci limit sp ace is actually a manifold,
solving a conjecture of Anderson–Cheeger–Colding–Tian. I n [Leb+15], Lebedeva–Matveev–
Petrunin–Shevchishin apply the results in [ Sim09;Sim12;Sim17] by Simon to show that any
polyhedral space in three dimensions with non-negative cur vature in the Alexandrov sense
can be approximated by Riemannian manifolds with non-negat ive sectional curvature. Other
papers where the Ricci ﬂow from non-smooth initial data is st udied are [ BCW19;Der16;
Hoc16;HT18;Lai19;LT17;SS10;DSS20;Sim02;Xu13;LS21], where the list is deﬁnitely
non-exhaustive.
In many cases, the non-smooth spaces considered might have c onical points. These points
can be characterised by having a Euclidean cone as their tang ent cone. In [ GS18], Gianniotis
and Schulze studied the Ricci ﬂow coming out of spaces with is olated conical singularities
modelled on positively curved cones. These spaces are smoot h manifolds when we exclude

type I singularities, see Section 1 of [ GS18]. However, spaces with non-isolated conical points
can also be expected to show up as limits of manifolds; see, fo r instance, [ Che01], Example

conical singularities, generalising the results of Gianni otis–Schulze. These spaces are smooth
manifolds except along a closed, embedded curve, where each point is conical. The precise
meaning of this is given in Deﬁnition ( 1.2). We show short-time existence of a Ricci ﬂow
coming out of these spaces, under the additional assumption that the conical cross-section of
the singular points is positively curved, and prove curvatu re bounds for the solution.
Main statement. Before stating the main result of the paper, we deﬁne what it m eans
for a space to be a compact space with edge type conical singul arities. In order to do so, we
recall the deﬁnition of a metric cone over a smooth manifold.
Deﬁnition 1.1. Let (X,gX) be a smooth, closed ( n−1)−dimensional Riemannian manifold.
The topological cone over X, C(X),is deﬁned as the set of equivalences in the product
[0,∞]×X:
C(X) ={[0,∞]×X}/∼,
where the equivalence relation is given by (0 ,x)∼(0,y),for everyx,y∈X.We denote the
vertex ofC(X) byo.ForR>0,let
CR(X) :={(r,x)∈C(X)|r<R}.
We also equip C(X) with the standard conical metric gc=dr2+r2gX.
Deﬁnition 1.2. The pair (Z,gZ) is a compact space with edge type conical singularities
modelled on ( C(X)×R,G=gc⊗gR) along a closed, embedded curve Γ ⊂Mif
(1) (Z\Γ,gZ) is a smooth Riemannian manifold, with gZan incomplete metric.
(2) (Z,dZ) is a compact metric space, where dZ=d(gZ) is the metric induced by gZ.
(3) There exist uniform r0>0 andη0>0 such that ∀p∈Γ,there exists a map
φp: (0,r0]×X×[−η0/2,η0/2]−→Z
such thatφis a diﬀeomorphism onto its image,
lim
r→0φp(r,x,0) =p∈Γ,
andthelength ofΓfrom q−toq+,where lim
r→0φp(r,x,±η0/2) =q±forany ﬁxed x∈X,
is such that l(Γ|[q−,q+]) =η0.
(4) Finally, for every p∈Γ and 0<r<r 0,it holds that

whereκ(r)→0 asr→0.
Given the deﬁnition above, we see that C(X)×Rwith the product metric is the Gromov-
Hausdorﬀ tangent cone at any p∈Γ.WhenXis a closed, simply connected manifold with
Rm(gX)≥1,we remark that Deruelle [ Der16] showed there is a unique expanding Ricci
soliton asymptotic to C(X).From now on, we will assume the conditions above on X.RICCI FLOW FROM SPACES WITH EDGE TYPE CONICAL SINGULARITIES 3

where(N×R,g0(t),¯q)t∈(0,∞)is the product Ricci ﬂow induced by (N×R,gN⊗gR),
and(N,gN)is the unique expander with positive curvature operator asy mptotic to
(C(Sn−1),gc).
Remark. We remark that the theorem still holds, with only minor modiﬁ cations to the proof,
if the metric gon the link of the cones, with Rm(g)≥1,varies smoothly along Γ .
Our approach to proving the result above is the following. We start by desingularising
the initial metric. The idea is to approximate, for each poin tp∈Γ on the curve, a small
neighbourhood of pbyN×[−η,η],whereη >0 is a small number that will depend on Γ ,
and the expander Nis glued in at a small scale s >0.We cover Γ in this way, making
sure our glueing is smooth so that we obtain a smooth Riemanni an manifold ( Ms,gs) that
approximates our initial space. The expanding soliton ( N,gN(t)) used above is known to
be stable due to the work of Deruelle–Lamm [ DL17]. We extend their result to N×R
with the product Ricci ﬂow solution. After this, we prove uni form curvature bounds for the
approximations via an iteration argument. The idea is that o n a small neighbourhood of
anyp∈Γ,the approximated solution will stay close to the product Ric ci ﬂow onN×R,
in an appropriate sense, assuming bounds on the boundary of t his neighbourhood. Since we
do not want to assume any control over time, we use pseudoloca lity to control the solution
far enough from the curve (where the metric is conical), and a n iteration argument with
overlapping neighbourhoods as above to show we do not need an y control on the horizontal
ends of this neighbourhood. Then we let sց0 to obtain a limit solution.
We observe that the condition on the curvature of the model co nes is only used when we
apply the existence and stability of such expanding soliton s; our solution does not depend on
any curvature bounds for the initial data or the approximati ng solutions. In particular, this
construction could be carried out in the same way if existenc e and stability of expanders out
of more general cones were proven.
Outline. We now give an overview of how the paper is organised. In Secti on2, we recall
a few properties of expanding Ricci solitons asymptotic to c ones and deﬁne the model class
we will be working with. In Section 3we adapt the stability result of Deruelle–Lamm [ DL17]4 LUCAS LAVOYER
to extend it to N×Rwith the product metric, which can be seen as a nonnegatively curved
expanding soliton. The observation is that the curvature is still decaying with the inverse of
the distance to the spine {qmax}×R,whereqmaxis the unique critical point of the potential
functionfN.Together with the splitting of the heat kernel on a product ma nifold, this turns
out to be enough to obtain the same stability result.
In Section 4we localise the stability obtained in Section 3and prove uniform estimates
for solutions in our model class. In order to do that, we split our space into two regions:
theconicalandexpanding region. On the conical region, our metric is almost conical a nd,
therefore, almost ﬂat. This allows Perelman’s pseudolocal ity to control the ﬂow. We are then
able to obtain uniform control along the curve using an overl ap argument, moving from a
local control, i.e., of a small neighbourhood of a (any) poin t in the approximate curve Γ sto
a result controlling a neighbourhood of the whole curve.
The observation is that the estimates on the conical region c ontrol our solution far out
in the neighbourhood, but we also initially assume control o n the ’horizontal ends’ of such
neighbourhood, which puts us in a position where we can apply the local stability result to
obtain estimates on a smaller neighbourhood of a point in the curve. In order to do so, we
rely on the fact that the heat kernel KLassociated to the Lichnerowicz operator (deﬁned in
section3) splits on a product manifold, so KL=KN
LKR,whereKN
LandKRare the heat
kernels onNandR,respectively. Along with this, the classical decay estimat e for the heat
kernel in Euclidean space combined with the results in [ DL17] yield the needed estimate:

is the product Ricci ﬂow induced by ( N×R,gN⊗gR),and the norm is also deﬁned in section
3. The exponential decay of the heat kernel in the R−direction implies that the inﬂuence of
the ’horizontal ends’ is small at the centre. We do this for en ough points pk∈Γsso that we
cover Γ s.This can then be improved indeﬁnitely by overlapping such re gions until we obtain
that the control only depends on estimates in the conical reg ion.
Finally, in Section 5we construct the approximating solution explicitly and pas s to a limit
withsց0.This gives us a solution to the Ricci ﬂow that exists for t∈(0,T] and has the
right curvature decay. Furthermore, as tց0,we show that away from Γ ,the Ricci ﬂow g(t)
converges to gZlocally smoothly uniformly after being pulled back by an app ropriate map.
The solution also converges back to ( Z,dZ) in the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ sense.

2.Preliminaries
We start by brieﬂy recalling the deﬁnition of gradient Ricci solitons, ﬁrst introduced by
Hamilton in [ Ham88]. The triple ( N,gN,fN),where (N,gN) is a Riemannian manifold and
fNis a smooth function on N,is a gradient Ricci soliton if it satisﬁes
HessgNfN=1
2L∇fNgN=Ric(gN)+λgN,
for some constant λ,whereLdenotes the Lie derivative. The soliton is expanding if λ>0,
steady ifλ= 0 or shrinking if λ <0.In our case, λ >0 and the soliton is an expandingRICCI FLOW FROM SPACES WITH EDGE TYPE CONICAL SINGULARITIES 5
gradient Ricci soliton. We can always normalise the metric s o thatλ=1
2.If the soliton has
bounded curvature, by possibly changing the potential func tion by a constant if necessary,
we can assume that fN≥0.An expanding Ricci soliton induces a solution to the Ricci ﬂo w

N=id.
We can now give a precise deﬁnition of an expanding Ricci soli ton coming out of a cone.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let (X,gX) be a smooth Riemannian manifold and
(C(X),gc=dr2+r2gX,o)
be the associated cone with vertex o.We say that the expanding Ricci soliton ( N,gN,fN) is
asymptotic to the cone C(X) if
(1) for some Λ 0>0,there isF: [Λ0,∞)×X−→N,a diﬀeomorphism onto its image,
such thatN\Im(F) is compact and
fN(F(r,x)) =r2

for every (r,x)∈[Λ0,∞)×X.

In [Der16], Deruelle shows that if Xis diﬀeomorphic to the standard sphere Sn−1and
the metric on the sphere satisﬁes Rm(g)≥1,butRm(g)/\e}atio\slash≡1,then the expanding soliton
smoothing out the cone over Xexists and it is unique.
For the expanding soliton, an important observation is that the notion of asymptotic cone
coincides with the notion of rough initial data in the Gromov -Hausdorﬀ sense (see [ Der16]
for the details). It is also standard to consider the followi ng natural coordinate at inﬁnity on
the expander:
r:= 2/radicalbig
f= (F−1)∗r.
We userto measure the distance from a point on the manifold to the tip of the expander,
i.e., the critical point of fN,which is unique when Rm(gN)≥0 and the expander is nor-
malised. In fact, since we will be working with the expander a t scales >0,we also de-
ﬁne the radial coordinate for this case, given by rs= 2√sfs,wherefs=f◦φs.We can
also deﬁne Fs: [Λ0√s,∞)×X→NbyFs= (φs)−1◦F◦as,whereas(r,x) =/parenleftbiggr√s,x/parenrightbigg
for
(r,x)∈[0,∞)×X.Hence,rs(Fs(r,x)) =r.
The next lemma shows us that the expander at scale sconverges to the cone as s→0 and
it is indeed natural to consider Fs.The proof is a straightforward computation (see equation
2.6 on [GS18]).
Lemma 2.2. Under the construction above, F∗
sgN(s)converges to gcass→0,uniformly
away from oinC4
loc.6 LUCAS LAVOYER
We also state a second lemma from [ GS18], which will be useful to us later.
Lemma 2.3. (Lemma 2.1, [ GS18]). Let(N,gN,fN)be an asymptotically conical gradient
Ricci expander, and let gN(t), t≥0,be the induced Ricci ﬂow with gN(0) =gN.There exists
γ0≥1, c,Λ0>0such that

.
From now on, ( N,gN,fN) will be a positively curved expanding gradient Ricci solit on,
qmaxthe unique maximal point of fN,andgN(t) will be its associated Ricci ﬂow. We also
observe that given the Euclidean metric on R, gR,one can construct a static solution to
the Ricci ﬂow which has an expanding structure. Deﬁne the pot ential function on Rby
fR(l) :=l2
4and letgR(t) =t(φt
R)∗gR,whereφt
R:R−→Ris a family of diﬀeomorphisms with

R).
Integrating this, φt
Ris then given by φt
R=1√
tidR.Thus,gR(t)≡gRfor all times and it solves
the Ricci ﬂow equation with Ric(gR(t))≡0.
Given the construction above, we can consider the expander ( N×R,g0,f0),whereg0=
gN⊗gR,f0(x,l) =fN(x)+fR(l),and the associated Ricci ﬂow given by g0(t) =g0(t)⊗gR(t).
Finally, let ˜Fs(r,x,l) = (Fs(r,x),l) for every ( r,x,l)∈[Λ0√s,∞)×X×R.
We now deﬁne the model class M(δ,Λ,s) that we will be working with. Metrics in
M(δ,Λ,s) can be seen as the smoothing of an edge type conical singular ity with an ex-
pander at scale scross an interval of the real line. In Section 5, our approximating solution
will be constructed as an element of M(δ,Λ,s) for appropriate values of δ,Λ ands.
Deﬁnition 2.4. Givenδ,s >0,Λ≥Λ0,we say that the pair ( M,g) belongs to M(δ,Λ,s)
if it is a complete Riemannian manifold with bounded curvatu re satisfying the following.
There exist a closed, embedded curve Γ s⊂M,with length l(Γs) =L >0,and a map
Φs:{rs≤1} ×[−L/2,L/2]−→Msuch that Φ sis a diﬀeomorphism onto its image, and
Φs({qmax}×[−L/2,L/2]) = Γ s,whereqmax∈Nis the unique critical point of the potential

3.Stability Under Ricci Flow
This section is dedicated to proving stability of ( N×R,g0(t)).We generalise, to our partic-
ularcase, theweak stability forexpanderswithpositivecu rvatureoperatorofDeruelle–Lamm
[DL17]. We follow [ DL17] as much as we can, pointing out when new ideas are needed. We
observe that, for consistency with the literature, in this s ection we have g0(t) =gN(t)⊗gR(t),

(see section 2 of [ DL17] for the details). Let h(t) :=g(t)−g0(t) and consider ¯h(t) = (1 +

We can also express the ﬂow ( 7) globally by:
∂t¯g(t) =−2Ric(¯g(t))+LV(¯g(t),g0(t))(¯g(t)),

The following is a minor extension of [ DL17, Lemma 3.1]. For completeness, we provide
their proof below, adding the small modiﬁcations needed to e xtend the result to N×R.
Lemma 3.1. Let(Nn,gN,fN), n≥3,be an expanding gradient Ricci soliton with quadratic
curvature decay. Consider (N×R,g0,f0)as in Section 2. Then, for any γ∈(0,1),the
operatorR0[·]+∇R1[·] :BX(0,γ)⊂X→Yis analytic and satisﬁes
/ba∇dblR0[h]+∇R1[h]/ba∇dblY≤c(n,γ,g0)/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2
X,
and
/ba∇dblR0[h′]−R0[h]+∇(R1[h′]−R1[h])/ba∇dblY≤c(/ba∇dblh′/ba∇dblX+/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblX)/ba∇dblh′−h/ba∇dblX,
for anyh,h′∈BX(0,γ),wherec=c(n,γ,g0).
Proof.Most of the estimates can be directly checked. The only non-t rivial estimate is the
zeroth order quadratic term of R0[h],which relies on the decay of curvature tensor of gN.
First, observe that the metric gN(t) also has quadratic curvature decay, and if p∈Nis such

3.2.The homogeneous case. When studying equation ( 7), the ﬁrst step is to estimate the
solution to the homogeneous linear equation
∂th=Lth, h(0) =h0∈L∞(S2T∗(N×R)), (8)
fort≥0.In [DL17, Theorem 4.1], the authors show that for a positively curved expander
(N,gN(t)) with quadratic curvature decay, we get /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblX≤c/ba∇dblh0/ba∇dblL∞(N,gN).In our case, ( N×
R,g0(t)) only has non-negative curvature operator. Furthermore, the curvature decay does
not hold along the R−direction. However, just like we did for Lemma 3.1, we can still prove10 LUCAS LAVOYER
similar estimates. We state this below and provide details o f the parts where our proof is
diﬀerent from [ DL17].
Theorem 3.2. Let(Nn×R,g0(t))t≥0,n≥3,be an expanding gradient Ricci soliton with the
usual product metric. Assume that (Nn,gN(t))has positive curvature operator and quadratic
curvature decay. Let (h(t))t≥0be a solution to the homogeneous linear equation (8). Then
h(t)∈Xfor everyt≥0and/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblX≤c/ba∇dblh0/ba∇dblL∞(N×R,g0).
Proof.Given the norm deﬁned for X,we need an L∞estimate, an L2and anLn+4estimate.
TheL∞estimate follows directly from the fact that the Ricci curva ture is non-negative for
the expander N×R.Similarly, for the Ln+4estimate to work we only need the extra facts
that the solution is of Type III, i.e.,
|Rm(g0(t))|g0(t)+√
t|∇g0(t)Rm(g0(t))|g0(t)≤c
1+t,
and the Ricci ﬂow is non-collapsed. All of these still hold wh en we take the product of the
expander with Rand consider the product metric g0(t) =gN(t)⊗gR(t).
For theL2estimate, we need to be more careful. Our goal is to show
R/ba∇dbl −∇h/ba∇dblL2(C(x,l,R))≤c/ba∇dblh0/ba∇dblL∞(N×R),
for arbitrary ( x,l,R)∈N×R×R∗
+.This estimate heavily relies on the quadratic decay of
the curvature. Computing the evolution equation for |h|2,where the norm is always with
respect tog0(t),we get
∂t|h|2≤∆g0(t)|h|2−2|∇g0(t)h|2+c(n+1)|Rm(g0(t))/ba∇dblh|2.
We multiply this inequality by a smooth cut-oﬀ function ψ2:N×R×R+−→R+and inte-

the last line, the estimate on the average integral follows a s in the proof of Lemma 3.1./square
3.3.Heat kernel estimates. The next step is to prove heat kernel estimates. Again, many
of the estimates available for the heat kernel acting on func tions over ( N,gN,fN) only use
that the solution to the Ricci ﬂow is type III, non-collapsed and has non-negative Ricci/scalar
curvature. Thus, they still hold and will be useful for our se t-up. We move on to proving
on-diagonal bounds of the Lichnerowicz heat kernel.
Werecall thesetupfrom[ DL17]. Let (M,g(t))t∈[0,T)beacompleteRicci ﬂowwithbounded
curvature at all times. The heat equation coupled with Ricci ﬂow is given by
∂tu= ∆g(t)u+R(g(t))u, (9)
∂tg=−2Ric(g(t)),12 LUCAS LAVOYER
onM×(0,T).We also consider the conjugate heat equation:
∂
∂τu= ∆g(τ)u, (10)
∂
∂τu= 2Ric(g(τ))
onM×(0,t] whereτ(s) :=t−sfort>0 ﬁxed.
Following standard notation, we denote the heat kernel asso ciated to ( 9) byK(x,t,y,s),
for 0≤s<t<T, andx,y∈M.It is deﬁned by:
∂tK(·,·,y,s) = ∆g(t)K(·,·,y,s)+R(g(t))K(·,·,y,s),
∂tg=−2Ric(g(t)), (11)
lim
t→sK(·,t,y,s) =δy,
where (y,s)∈M×(0,T) are ﬁxed. Now, if ( x,t)∈M×(0,T) are ﬁxed, then K(x,t,·,·) is
the heat kernel associated to the conjugate heat equation:
∂
∂sK(x,t,·,·) = ∆g(τ)K(x,t,·,·),
∂
∂sg= 2Ric(g(τ)), (12)
lim
τ→0K(x,t,·,τ) =δx.
We now state some estimates for the heat kernel KLassociated to the Lichnerowicz oper-
ator. Recall that KL∈Hom(S2T∗(N×R),S2T∗(N×R)) isC1with respect to time and C2
with respect to space variables, and it satisﬁes, by deﬁniti on,
∂tKL(·,·,y,s) =LtKL(·,·,y,s),
∂tg0=−2Ric(g0(t), (13)
lim
t→sKL(·,t,y,s) =δy,
fory∈N×Rands∈[0,∞) ﬁxed. On the other hand, ﬁxing ( x,t),KLsatisﬁes the conjugate
backward heat equation:
∂
∂sKL(x,t,·,·) =−LsKL(x,t,·,·)+R(g0(s))KL(x,t,·,·),
∂
∂sg= 2Ric(g0(τ)), (14)
lim
τ→0KL(x,t,·,τ) =δx.
We ﬁrst recall the following diagonal bound for the Lichnero wicz heat kernel on an ex-
panding Ricci soliton with positive curvature operator fro m [DL17, Theorem 4.5]:
/ba∇dblKL(x,t,y,s)/ba∇dblHom(S2T∗y(N),S2T∗x(N))≤c(n+1,V0,A0)

diagonal bound as a straightforward application of Deruell e–Lamm’s result.RICCI FLOW FROM SPACES WITH EDGE TYPE CONICAL SINGULARITIES 13
Theorem 3.3. Let(Nn×R,g0(t))t≥0be an expanding gradient Ricci soliton such that
(N,gN(t))is a Ricci soliton with positive curvature operator. Then the heat kernel asso-
ciated to (13)satisﬁes the following Gaussian estimate:

the norm is /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbl=/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblHom(S2T∗y(N×R),S2T∗x(N×R)).
Proof.Let/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblg0be the norm on Hom(S2T∗(N×R),S2T∗(N×R)).Consider points ( x,rx)

3.4.The inhomogeneous case. Having obtained bounds for the homogeneous linear equa-
tion and good estimates for the heat kernel on ( N×R,g0(t))t≥0,we can proceed to estimate
the inhomogeneous equation. We state below Theorem 3.4and Theorem 3.5, and refer the
reader to [ DL17] for the details. It is important to note, however, the depen dence on the
decay of the heat kernel on R,in the form of Theorem 3.3.
Theorem 3.4. LetRbe inY.Then, any solution to (∂t−Lt)h=Rwithh(0) =h0∈
L∞(N×R,g0)of the form h=KL∗R,i.e.,
h(x,t) =ˆt
0ˆ
N×R<KL(x,t,y,s),R(y,s)>dµg0(s)(y)ds,
is inXand satisﬁes
/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblX≤c(/ba∇dblh0/ba∇dblL∞(N×R,g0)+/ba∇dblR/ba∇dblY),
for some positive uniform constant c.
As a corollary of Theorem 3.4and Lemma 3.1, we obtain the following.
Theorem 3.5. Let(Nn×R,g0(t))t≥0,whereg0(t) =gN(t)⊗gR(t)andn≥3,be an expanding
gradient Ricci soliton such that (N,gN(t))is a Ricci soliton with positive curvature operator
and quadratic curvature decay at inﬁnity, i.e.,
Rm(gN)>0,|Rm(gN)|(x)≤C
1+d2gN(p,x),∀x∈N,14 LUCAS LAVOYER
for some point p∈Nand a positive constant Cdepending on p.Then there exists ε>0such
that for any metric g∈L∞(N×R,g0)satisfying /ba∇dblg−g0/ba∇dblL∞(N×R,g0)≤ε,there exists a global
solution (N×R,g(t))t≥0to the DeTurck Ricci ﬂow with initial condition g.Moreover,
(1) the solution is analytic in space and time and, for any α,β≥0the following holds:
sup
x∈N×R,t>0|(√
t∇g0(t))α(t∂t)β(g(t)−g0(t))|g0(t)≤cα,β|g(0)−g0|L∞(N×R,g0),
(2) the solution above is unique in BX(g0,ε).
Remark. We observethat theresultabovecan bedirectly extendedto N×Rk,foranyk∈Z+,
since the heat kernel in Rkhas the same decay estimates.
4.Uniform estimates for the Ricci flow starting from the model class
We now consider a complete Ricci ﬂow ( Mn,g(t))t∈[0,T],withn≥4 and (M,g(0))∈
M(δ,s,Λ) for some Λ ≥Λ0.The constant Λ will separate our manifold into a conicalregion
and anexpanding region. In the conical region, the metric is δ−close to the product metric
onC(X)×R, and in the expanding region it is δ−close to the metric on the expander N×R
at scales.
4.1.Conical region estimates. In this section, we show how, if the initial data is in
M(δ,Λ,s),pseudolocality controls the ﬂow in the conical region, sinc e the metric is close to
being ﬂat. To do so, we work with the Ricci-DeTurck ﬂow. Let ˆ g(t) be a solution for the
Ricci-DeTurck ﬂow
∂tˆg=−2Ric(ˆg)+LW(ˆg,˜g)ˆg, (16)
whereW(ˆg,˜g)k= ˆgklˆgij(ˆΓl
ij−˜Γl
ij),and ˜g(t) is chosen as follows. For ( M,ˆg(0))∈ M(δ,Λ,s),
we deﬁne
˜g(t) =ξ1(rs)(Φ−1
s)∗g0(t+s)+(1−ξ1(rs))ˆg(0), (17)
whereξ: [0,1]/ma√sto→[0,1] is a ﬁxed smooth, non-increasing function which is identi cally 1
in [0,1
2] andξ= 0 in [5
8,1].Given a Ricci ﬂow ( M,g(t))t∈[0,T]withM(δ,Λ,s),consider

We assumethat Tis small enough so that g(t) andψtare smooth for every t∈[0,T] andψt
is a diﬀeomorphism. Then it is well known that ˆ g(t) = (ψ−1
t)∗g(t) solves ( 16). Assuming an a
prioriboundonthe gradient of ψ,the lemmabelow (see [ GS18, Lemma3.1]) implies that ˆ g(t)
is controlled until a deﬁnite positive time. The proof follo ws from Perelman’s pseudolocality,
using the fact that the metric is close to G=gc⊗gRin the region deﬁned below. We refer
the reader to [ GS18] for the details.
Lemma 4.1. FixB,α >0.There exist δ2(α)>0, γ2(B,α)>1and a constant C(G)>0
such that the following holds. Let (M,g(t))t∈[0,T]be a complete Ricci ﬂow with bounded

.
Before our main lemma, we state the following technical lemm a, which is just an adaptation
of [GS18, Lemma 4.3] to our setting.
Lemma 4.2. Let(N,gN,f)be an asymptotically conical gradient Ricci expander with p ositive
curvature operator and let (g0(t))t≥0be the induced Ricci ﬂow on N×Rwithg0(0) =g0.
There is a C(gN)>0such that for every Λ≥Λ0the following holds. Deﬁne Aλ0andBλ0
as above, for some γ≥1.Then, if the tensors h1, h2are supported in Aλ0and satisfy
|h1|g0(t)+|h2|2
g0(t)≤D

we have
/ba∇dblh1+∇g0(t)h2/ba∇dblYT≤C(gN)D.
The proof of the next lemma will follow [ GS18, Lemma 4.2] and we refer the reader to
their paper for the details of some steps. We will focus on the steps where our proof deviates
from theirs.

Working with the same spaces and norms as Gianniotis–Schulz e (see [GS18, page 22]), we
deﬁne the following two terms:

We will estimate S1andS2separately. It will also be helpful to split our analysis of t he
terms involving the cut-oﬀ function (supported in Aλ0∪Bλ0) intoAλ0andBλ0\Aλ0.
We ﬁrst estimate S2[h],noting that it is supported on Aλ0∪Bλ0.InAλ0,we can apply

where in the last line we used that χ2(1−χ2) is only non-zero in Aλ0∩Bλ0(so|h|g0(t)≤H)
and the fact that

inAλ0due to Lemma 2.3.
For the term χ2g−1∗g−1∗∇g0(t)h∗∇g0(t)hwe have
χ2g−1∗g−1∗∇g0(t)h∗∇g0(t)h=χ2(1−χ2)g−1∗g−1∗∇g0(t)h∗∇g0(t)h

So for every T′≤Tsuch that /ba∇dblχ2h/ba∇dblT′≤1

/ba∇dblχ2h/ba∇dblT′≤Cδ2.
Therefore, since

if max{δ2,Cδ2} ≤1
2C,we have /ba∇dblχ2h/ba∇dblT≤Cδ2.
In order to obtain the decay estimates and ﬁnish our proof, we utilise a local argument
and scaling. The idea is to ﬁrst work on a small enough region, where the decay estimates
will follow directly from parabolicity, making sure this sm all enough region is contained in
Dλ0.We then use the rescaling nature of the Ricci ﬂow to make sure t hat the estimates in
fact work for every point in D′
λ0.The ﬁrst step is proved in the following two claims.
Claim. There exist 0< r0<1, ε0>0,and constants Ca,b>0such that the following
holds. Let x0∈N, t0∈(0,1],0< r <min(√t0,r0),and consider g(t)a solution to the
Ricci-DeTurck ﬂow with background metric g0(t)on
C((x0,0),t0,r) :=/uniondisplay

BgN(t)(x0,r)×(−r0,r0)/parenrightbig

with|g(t)−g0(t)|g0(t)≤ε0.Then
|(r∇g0)a(r2∂t)b(g−g0)|g0((x0,0),t0)≤Ca,b.
Furthermore, for every k∈Nthere exists 0<εk≤ε0such that if |g(t)−g0(t)|g0(t)≤εkon
C(x0,t0,r),then there exists a constant C′
a,b>0such that
|(r∇g0)a(r2∂t)b(g−g0)|g0(x0,t0)≤C′
a,bsup
C((x0,0),t0,r)|g(t)−g0(t)|g0(t),
as long asa+2b≤k.
Forr0suﬃciently small, wecanﬁndacoordinatesystemsuchthat g0(t)iswell controlled in
BgN(0)(x0,r)×(−r0,r0) fort∈[0,1].The estimate then follows directly from local parabolic
estimates. For details, see [ Bam14, Proposition 2.5].
Claim. There exists 0<δ<1,independent of γandΛ,such that for any (x,l,t)∈D′
λ0,we
have
C((x,l),t,√
δt)⊂Dλ0.
Since the metric is not changing in the R−direction, we ﬁrst choose 0 <r0<λ0/2.This
guarantees the inclusion in the R−direction. For the details of the inclusion for the ball in
N,see [GS18, Lemma 4.2].
We now move on to the decay estimates for D′
λ0.If 0<t<1,this follows directly from the
two claims above. Therefore, ﬁx ( x0,l0,t0)∈D′

where the R−direction is not changing since rescaling by1
ηcancels out with φη−1
R.Therefore,
the second claim holds for the new δgiven byδη.We can then apply the ﬁrst claim to obtain
the same estimates as before. Rescaling back to the original solution, we get the decay
estimates from the statement. /square
4.3.Estimates on the expanding region. Finally, we prove estimates for the expanding
region of our solution to the Ricci ﬂow starting from M(δ,Λ,s).Assuming the bounds on the
conical region and an a prioribound on the horizontal ends of a sub-region of the expanding
region, we control the evolution of our solution in the inter ior of the sub-region. Overlapping
such sub-regions, we obtain the needed estimates. From now o n, we ﬁxp0= Φs(qmax,0)∈Γs
andλ0>0.
Lemma 4.4. For everyε >0and everyk∈N,there exists δ0=δ0(gN,ε,k)>0such that

(M,g(0))∈ M(δ,Λ,s)forδ≤δ0,Λ>0ands≤1

ˆg(t) = (ψ−1

the expanding region as:

that assumption ( 28) can be improved to

Therefore, at t=τ0,(28) (and, thus, ( 30)) holds with the LHS less or equal to ε<1.This
is already a contradiction with the deﬁnition of τ0being the maximal time t∈[0,T] such
that (28) holds with C= 1.Then, it follows that τ0≥min{1
32γ,T}and the estimates in the
statement of the lemma hold for t∈[0,min{1

Putting everything together, we conclude that our estimate s hold along the whole curve
and depend only on the assumptions for the conical region and for the initial data, i.e., our24 LUCAS LAVOYER

(t+s)j/2|(∇˜g)j(ˆg−˜g)|˜g<ε

following. If (M,g(0))∈ M(δ1,Λ,s),then for every t∈(0,min{(32γ)−1,T}]there is a map

inIm(Θs,t),whereg0(t) =gN(t)⊗gR(t).
Proof.The curvature estimates follow from Lemma 4.1and Lemma 4.4, applying a loop
argument to show that the threshold Bfrom Lemma 4.1can always be avoided (see [ GS18]
for the details).
The statement for Θ t,sfollows by deﬁning Θ s,t= Φs◦ψtand combining, again, lemmata
4.1and4.4. The inclusions for Im(Θt,s) are a direct application of [ GS18, Theorem 3.1] and
the fact that
|˜∇ls|˜g(x,t) =|∇g0(t/s)l|g0(t/s)(φs(Φ−1
s(x))) = 1,
andIm(ls) = [−L/2,L/2]. /square
If, in addition, we assume a bound |Rm(g(0))| ≤Aoutside the conical and expanding
regions, we obtain a global bound for Rmin time as a direct application of Shi’s estimates
and the maximum principle.
Corollary 4.6. Let(M,g)∈ M(δ0,Λ,s)fors∈(0,s0],whereδ0(gN)ands0(Λ)are given
by Theorem 4.5. Suppose that

Then, there exists T(A,gN)andC(A,gN)such that the Ricci ﬂow g(t)withg(0) =gexists
fort∈[0,T(A,gN)]and satisﬁes
max

Moreover, all the conclusions from Theorem 4.5hold.
5.The Ricci flow out of spaces with edge type conical singulari ties
Inthissection, weassumethat r0= 1,which istruemodulearescaling argument, Λ 1≥Λ0,
and thatκ>0 is such that γZ(r)<κforr∈(0,1].We will approximate ( Z,gZ) by removing
small conical neighbourhoods of points in Γ and glueing in sm all neighbourhoods of points
of the spine of N×Rat scales >0.After making sure we have a smooth Riemannian
manifold, we can ﬂow it by Ricci ﬂow. The estimates from Secti on4will allow us to pass to
a limit solution as sց0.This limit will be shown to converge back to ( Z,gZ) in the pointed
Gromov-Hausdorﬀ topology and, away from the singular curve , in a locally smooth sense.

andconsiderthemap φk:=φqkfromDeﬁnition( 1.2), i.e.,φk: (0,1]×X×[−η/2,η/2]−→Z.
Thus,φkparametrises a neighbourhoodof qk∈Γ.We then deﬁne Msby an iteration method.

We will work with a subdivision of IL:= [−L/2,L/2] by sub-intervals of length η.We denote

•φn0(r,v,η/2) =φ1(r,v,−η/2),forr∈(0,1] andv∈X.
Remark. We are picking enough points in Γ so that each small neighbour hood of these points
is isometric to part of C(X)×Rand they cover the curve. By removing this neighbourhood
and glueing in part of N×R,we smooth out the curve. The equivalence relations above
make sure our ﬁnal manifold is smooth.
Given the construction above, we can consider the natural em beddings
Φs:{rs≤1}×[−L/2,L/2]−→Msand Ψ s:Zs−→Ms,
under the identiﬁcation Φ s(·,−L/2) = Φ s(·,L/2).We also deﬁne the functions rsandlsby

sation of the conical region, φ: [s1/4,1]×X×[−L/2,L/2]→Ms,as follows. If l∈[−L/2+

To deﬁne the metric on Ms,we consider the following regions on our manifold:

LetA<∞be such that max
rs=1|Rm(gs)|gs≤A,which exists because of the deﬁnition of gs.
We then consider δ0=δ0(gN)>0 as in Theorem 4.5. Choosing κsmall and Λ 1large, we get
(Ms,gs)∈ M(δ0,Λ1,s),whereη0=η0(gZ).
5.2.The limit solution. We now consider Ricci ﬂows gs(t) onMs,withgs(0) =gsand
t∈[0,T],whereT >0 is given by Corollary ( 4.6). It follows from the same corollary that
max

max

j=0rj+2

fort∈[0,T].In particular, the second estimate yields Volgs(t)(Bgs(t)(x,t))≥v0,fort∈[0,T]
and somex∈ {rs= 1}.
Using Hamilton’s compactness theorem for Ricci ﬂows, we con sider a sequence slց0 and,
up to a subsequence, there exists a smooth, compact Ricci ﬂow (M,g(t))t∈(0,T]such that
(Msl,gsl(t))t∈(0,T]→(M,g(t))t∈(0,T],
where the convergence is given by the existence of diﬀeomorph ismsHl:Msl→Msuch that
H∗
lgsl(t)→g(t) (35)
uniformly locally in M×(0,T] in theC∞−topology. By deﬁning ˜Ψsl=H−1
sl◦Ψsl:Zsl→M,
we can show that there is a map Ψ : Z\Γ→M,diﬀeomorphism onto its image, such that
˜Ψsl→Ψ inC∞uniformly away from Γ .This follows directly from the curvature bounds for
gs(t) and Arzela-Ascoli (for an example of such construction, se e [GS18]).
5.3.Properties of the limit solution. From (33), it follows that g(t) satisﬁes
|Rm(g(t))|g(t)≤CM
t(36)
onM×(0,T].Moreover, given the smooth convergence of ˜Ψslto Ψ,as well as their re-
spective inverses, the identity H∗
slrsl= (Ψ−1
sl◦Hsl)∗(φ−1)∗rinIm(H−1
sl◦Ψsl) implies that
H∗
slrsl→(Ψ−1)∗((φ−1)∗r),locally uniformly on Im(Ψ) in theC∞sense. We then deﬁne the
following function on M:
rM=

(Ψ−1)∗((φ−1)∗r) inIm(Ψ◦φ),
0 in (Im(Ψ))c,

5.4.Improvement of expanding estimates for small scales. We show that if s >0
gets even smaller, the closeness of our solution to the expan der improves.
Lemma 5.1. For everyε >0andk∈Z+,there exist η1(ε,k)>0, s2(ε,k)>0small
andγ3(ε,k),Λ2(ε,k)large such that the following holds. For each s∈(0,s2], γ≥γ3and

5.5.Distance control for high curvature region. In this subsection, we prove curvature
bounds for points away from {rM= 0}.Furthermore, for points of high curvature, we show
that the distance from {rM= 0}must be bounded on each time slice.

5.6.Gromov-Hausdorﬀ convergence to the initial data. In this section, we prove that
(M,dg(t))→(Z,dZ) in the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ sense as tց0.We show that for every ε>0,
Ψ : (Z\Γ,dZ)→(M,g(t)) is anε−isometry for small enough t>0.The result follows from
the two lemmata below.
Lemma 5.3. For everyε>0,there existδ1>0andt1>0such that for all t∈(0,t1],the
mapΨ :{r≥δ1} −→ {rM≥δ1}satisﬁes
sup/braceleftbig
|dg(t)(Ψ(z1),Ψ(z2))−dZ(z1,z2)|,z1,z2∈ {r≥δ1}/bracerightbig
<3ε. (38)
Proof.Letδ1>0 be such that diam Z({r=δ1})<ε+L.Since Ψ∗g(t)→gZlocally uniformly
away from Γ as tց0,it follows that diam g(t)({rM=δ1})<ε+Lfor smallt>0.LetdZ,δ1
be the intrinsic metric on {r≥δ1}induced by gZ,and similarly dg(t),δ1the intrinsic metric
on{rM≥δ1}induced by g(t).We claim that
|dZ,δ1(z1,z2)−dZ(z1,z2)|<ε, (39)
and
|dg(t),δ1(Ψ(z1),Ψ(z2))−dg(t)(Ψ(z1),Ψ(z2))|<ε, (40)
for allz1,z2∈ {r≥δ1}.
We start by showing ( 39). It is clear that dZ(z1,z2)≤dZ,δ1(z1,z2).Let us assume that
dZ(z1,z2)<dZ,δ1(z1,z2).Then there exists a path connecting z1toz2,starting from z1and
escaping {r≥δ1}.Letq1∈ {r=δ1}be the ﬁrst point this path touches {r=δ1}and30 LUCAS LAVOYER
q2∈ {r=δ1}be the point where the path leaves {r≤δ1}.We can choose δ1>0 small
enough so that dZ,δ1(q1,q2)≤dZ(q1,q2)+ε,sinceq1,q2∈ {r=δ1}.Therefore,
dZ(z1,z2)<dZ,δ1(z1,z2)≤dZ(z1,q1)+dZ(z2,q2)+dZ,δ1(q1,q2)
≤dZ(z1,q1)+dZ(z2,q2)+dZ(q1,q2)+ε
=dZ(z1,z2)+ε,
which suﬃces to prove the ﬁrst estimate. Similarly, we can pr ove (40).
By the uniform convergence of Ψ∗g(t) togZaway from Γ as t→0,we also have that
|dZ,δ1(z1,z2)−dg(t),δ1(Ψ(z1),Ψ(z2))|< ε,for allz1,z2∈ {r≥δ1}.Putting everything to-
gether and using the triangle inequality, we prove the lemma . Possibly after making δ1>0
smaller, we can also get diam( {r≤δ1})<L+ε.
/square
Lemma 5.4. For everyε>0,there exists small enough t2>0such that the following holds.
For anyx∈ {rM= 0},we have
dg(t)(x,Im(Ψ))<ε,
for allt∈(0,t2].
Proof.Takex∈ {rM= 0}=Im(Ψ)c.Then, of course, x∈ {rM≤δ2}for anyδ2>0.Ifδ2
is small enough, and for large enough l,we consider ql∈Mslsuch thatHl(x) =ql.Identify-

dg(t)(x,{rM=δ2})<ε,
for small enough tandδ2,that will depend on c0>0 from Lemma 5.2. Therefore, for any
x∈Im(Ψ)c,there exists y∈ {rM=δ2} ⊂Im(Ψ) such that dg(t)(x,y)<ε.

for largek.The last inclusion follows from [ GS18, Lemma 5.3]. Now let qk∈Mbe such that
(qmax,0) =˜φtk+slk◦R−1
k(qk)∈N×Rsatisﬁes
|Rm(gN)|gN(qmax) = max
N|Rm(gN)|gN.
Lemma5.2forζ=1
2maxN|Rm(gN)|gNyieldsˆC,ˆγ >1 such that
qk∈ {rM=/radicalbig

and
dg(tk)/parenleftBig
{rM=/radicalbig
ˆγtk},{rM= 0}/parenrightBig
≤ˆC√tk.
Given anypk/∈Im(Ψ),we know that rM(pk) = 0,hence
dg(tk)(pk,qk)≤ˆC√tk.
Therefore,
dgN⊗gR/parenleftBig

≤2ˆC,
for largek.Putting this together with ( 41), (42) and letting γk→+∞,we get the conver-
gence of/parenleftbig

to (N×R,gN⊗gR,(¯q,¯l)) in the smooth pointed Cheeger-Gromov
topology. This is enough to conclude that
(M,1

kT]→(N×R,h(t),(¯q,¯l))t∈(0,∞)
in the smooth pointed Cheeger-Gromov topology, where ( N,h(t)) is a complete Ricci ﬂow
with bounded curvature and h(1) =gN⊗gR.The forward and backward uniqueness of Ricci
ﬂows gives h(t) =g0(t) for allt∈(0,∞),and this ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 1.3.32 LUCAS LAVOYER
