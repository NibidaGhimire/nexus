We consider a certain class of exactly solvable models, desc ribing spectral properties an electron
moving in random in time external ﬁeld with diﬀerent statist ical characteristics. This electron can
be band – like or belong to a quantum well. The known dynamical Keldysh model is generalized
for the case of ﬁelds with ﬁnite correlation time of ﬂuctuati ons and for ﬁnite transfer frequencies
of these ﬂuctuations. In all cases we are able to perform the c omplete summation of all Feynman
diagrams of corresponding perturbation series for the Gree n’s function. This can be done either
by the reduction of this series to some continuous fraction o r by the use of the generalized Ward
identity from which we can derive recurrence relations for t he Green’s function. In the case of a
random ﬁeld with ﬁnite transferred frequency there appear t he interesting eﬀects of modulation
of spectral density and density of states.

I. INTRODUCTION
While being an outstanding experimentalist, P.L. Kapitza sometimes ad dressed also some purely theoretical prob-
lems. Well known is his elegant solution of a problem of the motion of a cla ssical particle in fast oscillating ﬁeld [1],
where he essentially described this motion as a particle in a random ﬁeld with appropriate time averaging. Such ﬁelds
and processes appear in many problems of statistical radiophysics and radiotechnics, where a vast literature exists
[2; 3]. In quantum theory there is also multitude problems of this kind.
In this work we shall consider a certain class of exactly solvable quan tum mechanical problems, related in general
to the theory of electrons in disordered systems and quantum str uctures, which is a dynamical generalization of the
so called Keldysh model.
The initial model was introduced by L.V. Keldysh in his unpublished thes is in 1965 [4]. Some of his results were
used by A.L Efros in Ref. [5], devoted to doped semiconductors. The detailed presentation of diﬀerent aspects of this
model in the general context of electron theory of disordered sy stems was given in [6], where the notion of “Keldysh
model” was introduced for the ﬁrst time.
In the following, the number of similar models were proposed, e.g. for the description of the pseudogap appearing
due to electron scattering by ﬂuctuations of short – range order in one – dimensional systems [6–12], which were later
generalized for two – dimensional case to describe pseudogap in high – temperature superconductors [13–17].
Dynamical generalization of the initial Keldysh model for the case of electron scattering by random in timeﬂuctu-
ations of external ﬁeld was proposed by Kikoin and Kiselev [18], who c onsidered electrons in quantum dots. Detailed
presentation of diﬀerent results obtained for this and similar models was given in Ref. [19]. The present paper is
devoted to further development and generalization of this type of models both for the case of electrons in quantum
dots and band – like electrons in conductorsof diﬀerent dimensionalit ies under the inﬂuence of dynamic random ﬁelds.
II. DYNAMICAL KELDYSH MODEL
The model under consideration was proposed by Keldysh in 1965 [4] as some limiting case of problem of electron
scattering by the random ﬁeld of static impurities in a disordered sys tem [6; 20]. Keldysh has shown that the single
– particle Green’s function in Gaussian random ﬁeld V(r) with “forward” scattering (i.e. with zero transferred
momentum, corresponding to the limit of inﬁnite spatial range of ﬂuc tuations of the random potential) described by

correlator ( dis spatial dimensionality):
D(r−r′) =/an}bracketle{tV(r)V(r′)/an}bracketri}ht= ∆2→D(q) = (2π)d∆2δ(q), (1)
can be found by complete summation of all Feynman diagrams of pert urbation series. In fact, according to the usual
diagram rules for the problem of scattering by static random disord er [6; 20], diagram of N- th order contains N
interaction line with Gaussian random ﬁeld (denoted by by wavy lines), 2N+1 solid lines, corresponding to Green’s
functions and 2 Nvertices. The total number of diagrams in the given order of pertu rbation theory ANcorresponds
to the total number of ways to connect 2 Nvertices by Ninteraction lines, which is equal to [6; 21]:
AN= (2N−1)!! =(2N−1)!
2N−1(N−1)!. (2)
Diagrammatic contributions of the lowest orders in the series for sin gle – electron Green’s function are shown in Fig.
1. In this model all Feynman diagrams of the given order Ngive the same contributions to Green’s function, so that
the full series for it is of the following form:
G(E) =G0(E)/braceleftBigg
1+∞/summationdisplay
N=1(2N−1)!!G2N
0(E)∆2N/bracerightBigg
. (3)
Further, to shorten notations we deﬁne E=ǫ−ǫp, whereǫpis free the electron spectrum, so that the “bare” Green’s
function is written as G0(E) = 1/E. Using integral representation of Γ – function, we can use:
(2N−1)!! =1√
2π/integraldisplay∞
−∞dtt2N−2e−t2/2(4)
so that the retarded Green’s function (after the summation of ge ometric series) can be written as:
GR(E) =1√
2π∆2/integraldisplay∞
−∞dVe−V2/2∆2
E−V+iδ(5)
This equation has an obvious meaning [6] — electron propagates in spa tially homogeneous Gaussian random ﬁeld.
There is also another way to obtain this elegant result, which was also proposed by Keldysh [4] and later by Efros [5],
and is based on the use of an exact Ward identity, which allows the der ivation of diﬀerential equation for the Green’s
function. This equation has the following form:
∆2dG(E)
dE+E·G(E) = 1. (6)
Solving this equation with boundary condition G(E→ ∞) = 1/Eimmediately leads to Eq. (5) [6].
Direct consequence of the obtained solution is the appearance of t he Gaussian “tail” in the density of states of an
electron in energy region ǫ <0 [6].
InRefs. [18; 19]Keldyshmodelwasreformulatedforthe caseofe lectronscatteredbyveryslow temporal ﬂuctuations
of the random potential. Appropriate dynamical Keldysh model can also be generalized for the case of scattering by
multiple component Gaussian non – Markovian random ﬁelds [19].
As an example, following Refs. [18; 19] we may consider an electron in a single quantum well (dot), which is formed
by appropriate conﬁning potential, as shown in Fig. 2. The gate crea tes external noise slowly changing conﬁning
potential of the well.
Single – particle Hamiltonian for this problem has the following form:
H= [ǫ0+V(t)]n. (7)
wheren=c†c, andc†,care creation and annihilation operators of an electron at the level w ithin well. For simplicity
we consider spinless (spinpolarized) electrons. Classical potential random (Gaussian) in time V(t) is determined by
its average value and pair correlation function:
/an}bracketle{tV(t)/an}bracketri}ht= 0,/an}bracketle{tV(t)V(t′)/an}bracketri}ht=D(t−t′). (8)
For this function we assume the following form:
D(t−t′) = ∆2e−γ|t−t′|, (9)3
whereγ= 1/τ, withτdetermining characteristic correlation time of potential ﬂuctuatio ns, while ∆ is the amplitude
of the noise. We may consider two limiting cases:
γ→ ∞:D(t−t′)→∆2δ(t−t′), (10)
γ→0 :D(ω)→2π∆2δ(ω). (11)
HereD(ω) is the Fourier – transform of D(t−t′). The ﬁrst case corresponds to “fastest” possible noise (“white ”
noise) and Markovian random process. The second case correspo nds to slow noise, with Keldysh model giving its
slowest possible realization with (inﬁnitely) large relaxation time of ﬂuc tuations (inﬁnite memory, of non – Markovian
process).
Single – electron (retarded) Green’s function of electron in a well fo r the given realization of the potential is:
GR(ǫ) =1
ǫ−ǫ0−V+iδ(12)
whereǫ0is energy level in a well, while time – averaging is again reduced to Gaussia n integration of this expression
with distribution function P(V) = 1/√
2π∆2exp(−V2/(2∆2):
GR(ǫ) =1√
2π∆2/integraldisplay∞
−∞dVe−V2/2∆2

Similarly we can consider an electron not within the well, but within energ y band of a system (placed between
capacitor plates, on which a random noise is generated) of any dimen sionality. In this case it is just suﬃcient to make
a replacement ǫ0→ǫp, whereǫpis band spectrum of an electron with quasimomentum p.
The single – well model is easily generalized also for the case of severa l wells [18; 19], which leads to Keldysh model
with multicomponent noise. Particularly interesting is the model of tw o quantum wells, which (in its band – like
variant) is deeply related to an exactly solvable model of the pseudo gap state [7–12]. However, below we shall only
consider the single – well model, leaving the two – well case (pseudoga p ﬂuctuations) for the separate work.
III. KELDYSH MODEL AND FLUCTUATIONS WITH FINITE CORRELATION TIME
Below we show that an exact solution for the single – particle Green’s f unction can also be obtained for Keldysh
model with ﬁnite correlation time of ﬂuctuations τ=γ−1. This solution is easily found using the method proposed
by one of the authors in Ref. [11], devoted to the model of pseudog ap in one – dimensional systems.
Fourier – transform of Eq. (9), which is associated with interaction lines in diagrams, can be written as:
D(ω) = 2π∆21
πγ
ω2+γ2= 2π∆21
πγ
(ω+iγ)(ω−iγ)(14)
Forγ→0 this is naturally reduced to the second expression in (11). Let us c larify the calculations of a diagram of
an an arbitrary order. In fact this can be done exactly. As an exam ple let us consider some typical diagrams of third
order shown in Fig. 3. We can easily calculate the contribution of an ar bitrary diagram as we can actually guarantee

that nonzero contribution to integrals (over transferred frequ encies) appear only from the poles of Lorentzians1D(ω).
For example, elementary calculationsshow, that contribution of dia gramin Fig. 3 (d) to the retarded Green’s function
has the following form:
∆61
ǫ−ǫ01
ǫ−ǫ0+iγ1
ǫ−ǫ0+2iγ1
ǫ−ǫ0+3iγ1
ǫ−ǫ0+2iγ1
ǫ−ǫ0+iγ1
ǫ−ǫ0(15)
Contributionsofarbitrarydiagramsarequite similar: integers k, written aboveelectroniclinesFig. 3, showhavemany
times the term iγenters corresponding denominator. Note that contribution of dia gram with crossing interaction
lines in Fig. 3 (d) are just equal to the contribution of diagram with no intersections of interaction lines shown in
Fig. 3 (e). This is a manifestation of the general property – contrib ution of any diagram with crossing interaction
lines is equal to the contribution of some diagram with no intersection s [11]. Precisely because of this property we
can introduce an exact algorithm of complete summation of Feynman series.
Details of combinatorics and rules to reduce diagrams with crossing in teraction lines to those without intersections
were considered in Ref. [11] (see also Ref. [6])2. One can easily convince himself that the number of irreducible
1In the problem analyzed in Ref. [11] this statement is only ap proximate [21]. Here all calculations (frequency integrat ions) are performed
exactly.
2In the problem under consideration here combinatorics of di agrams is reduced to commensurate case of Ref. [11].5

diagrams for self – energy which are equal to the given diagram with n o intersections of interaction lines is equal
to the product of certain combinatorial factors v(k) (kis the number of iγcontributions in the denominator of
the Green’s function in diagram without intersections, standing belo wkinteraction lines) which are associated with
consequent interaction lines of this diagram. Correspondingly in the following we can use just the diagrams with no
intersections of interaction lines associating extra combinatorial f actorsv(k) to interaction lines of such diagrams. In
our case v(k) =k[11].
Thenwecaneasilyobtaintherecursionrelationdeterminingtheirred ucibleself–energy,whichincludes alldiagrams
of corresponding Feynman series [6; 11]:
Σk(ǫ,ǫ0) =∆2v(k)
ǫ−ǫ0+ikγ−Σk+1(ǫ,ǫ0);v(k) =k (16)
Then we immediately get the recursion relation for Green’s function it self:
Gk(ǫ,ǫ0) ={ǫ−ǫ0+ikγ−∆2v(k+1)Gk+1(ǫ,ǫ0)}−1, (17)
andthephysicalGreen’sfunctionis deﬁnedas G(ǫ,ǫ0)≡Gk=0(ǫ,ǫ0), whichisequivalentthe completesumofFeynman

ǫ−ǫ0−∆2
ǫ−ǫ0+iγ−2∆2
ǫ−ǫ0+2iγ−3∆2

Symbolically our recursion relation can be represented as a kind of “D yson equation”, shown in Fig. 4.
Forγ= 0 we can use the following continuous – fraction representation of incomplete (upper) Γ – function:

IV. FLUCTUATIONS WITH FINITE TRANSFERRED FREQUENCY AND FIN ITE CORRELATION TIME
Let us considernowmoregeneralcaseofﬂuctuations with ﬁnite ch aracteristicfrequency ω0. We shall againconsider
classical potential random in time V(t) (8) with pair correlation function:

Forω0= 0 we obtain again correlator (9) and the model with zero transfer red frequency considered above.

FIG. 6 Diagrammatic representation of equation for the Gree n’s function
Thus in corresponding diagram technique we have two sorts of inter action lines – wavy and dashed, transferring
frequencies + ω0and−ω0correspondingly. Both interaction lines lead to addition of iγterm to energy ǫin each
electron Green’s function, which is below corresponding interaction line. In Fig. 5 we show typical second order
diagrams. It is easy to see that in current model the contribution o f diagrams with intersecting interaction lines does
not necessarily coincide with some diagram without such intersection s. However, we still can obtain an exact solution
for the single – electron Green’s function using the generalized Ward identity.
A. Generalized Ward identity and recurrence equations for t he Green’s function
Single – electron Green’s function Gcan be easily determined via the full two – particle function Φ:

. (22)
HereΦisthefulltwo–particleGreen’sfunction, includingfourexter nalelectroniclinesandcontributioncorresponding
to the product of two “dressed” single – particle Green’s functions G. To shorten expressions in our analysis we make
a replacement ǫ−ǫ0→ǫ, i.e. count energies from energy level in the well ǫ0, thenG0(ǫ) = 1/ǫ. Diagrammatic
representation of Eq. (22) for the Green’s function is shown in Fig. 6. To ﬁnd two – particle Green’s functions Φ
entering Eq. (22) we shall use the generalized Ward identity [22], whic h in this purely dynamical model takes the
following form:
G(ǫ+ω)−G(ǫ) =−/summationdisplay
ǫ′Φǫǫ′(ω)/braceleftbig
G−1
0(ǫ′+ω)−G−1

. (23)
Here the expression in ﬁgure brackets in the r.h.s. G−1
0(ǫ′+ω)−G−1
0(ǫ′) =ǫ′+ω−ǫ′=ωis independent of ǫ′, so
that we immediately obtain:
/summationdisplay
ǫ′Φǫǫ′(ω) =−G(ǫ+ω)−G(ǫ)
ω. (24)7
In the current problem any interaction line again adds iγterm to energy of electronic lines below it, i.e. eﬀectively
our interaction lines transfer a complex frequency ±ω0+iγ. Then Ward identity (23) for the vertex with + ω0takes
the form:
G(ǫ+ω0+iγ)−G(ǫ) =−/summationdisplay
ǫ′Φǫǫ′(ω0)(ǫ′+ω0+(k+1)iγ−(ǫ′+kiγ)) =−(ω0+iγ)/summationdisplay
ǫ′Φǫǫ′(ω0).(25)
As a result for the two – particle Green’s function with + ω0vertex we obtain:
/summationdisplay
ǫ′Φǫǫ′(ω0) =−G(ǫ+ω0+iγ)−G(ǫ)
ω0+iγ. (26)
Similarly for Φ with −ω0vertex we get:
/summationdisplay
ǫ′Φǫǫ′(−ω0) =−G(ǫ−ω0+iγ)−G(ǫ)
−ω0+iγ. (27)
Substituting these two – particle functions (26) and (27) into Eq. ( 22), we obtain the functional equation for the
Green’s function:
G(ǫ) =G0(ǫ)−G0(ǫ)∆2
2/braceleftbiggG(ǫ+ω0+iγ)−G(ǫ)
ω0+iγ+G(ǫ−ω0+iγ)−G(ǫ)

(28)
so that:
G(ǫ) =1−∆2

0+γ2. (29)
It should be noted that the use of the generalized Ward identity (23 ) allows also an exact solution (reducing to the
integral equation) of the problem of ﬁnding the single – particle Gree n’s function G(ǫ) OED an electron in random
Gaussian potential with arbitrary correlator D(ω). Equation for the Green’s function in this case has the following
form:
G(ǫ) =G0(ǫ)+G0(ǫ)/integraldisplay+∞
−∞dω
2πD(ω)/summationdisplay
ǫ′Φǫǫ′(ω). (30)
Using Ward identity (23) we immediately obtain (24) and the integral e quation for the Green’s function:
G(ǫ) =G0(ǫ)−G0(ǫ)/integraldisplay+∞
−∞dω
2πD(ω)G(ǫ+ω)−G(ǫ)
ω. (31)
If we use D(ω) in the form given by Eq. (21) the frequency integral here is easily c alculated. The second factor in
the integrand does not contain pole at ω= 0 and is analytic in the upper half – plane of complex ω, so that closing
the integration contour above, we obtain the contribution to integ ral only from the poles at ω=±ω0+iγof two
Lorentzians in (21) immediately getting (28), and functional equat ion (29).
Solving Eq. (29) by iterations, starting from initial the approximatio n
/tildewideG0(ǫ) =1
G−1
0(ǫ)+∆2iγ
ω2
0+γ2, (32)
one can easily see that each iteration adds to energy (besides ±ω0) additional iγterm. Thus we can introduce the
following notations:
Gn(ǫ)≡G(ǫ+niγ)G0n(ǫ)≡G0(ǫ+niγ) =1
ǫ+niγ, (33)
wheren= 0,1,2...and apply Eq. (29) for energy ǫ+niγ, making replacement ǫ→ǫ+niγ. Then in notations of
(33) equation (29) takes the form3:
Gn(ǫ) =1−∆2
2/bracketleftBig

−ω0+iγ/bracketrightBig
G−1
0n(ǫ)+∆2iγ
ω2
0+γ2. (34)
3Naturally, Eq. (34) can be also obtained directly using the g eneralized Ward identity applying it for energy ǫ+niγ.8
As a result we obtain the recursion procedure where at each “stor ey”n Gndepends only on real energy. Numerical
realization of such procedure is rather simple. At some high “storey ”n=N≫1 we deﬁne a set of GN(ǫ), e.g.
GN(ǫ) = 0. Then, withe the help of (34) and interpolation we ﬁnd the set GN−1(ǫ) etc., until we reach the physical
G(ǫ) =Gn=0(ǫ).
Forω0= 0 we return to the model with zero transferred frequency and ﬁ nite correlation time described above. In
this limit the recursion equation (34) takes the form:
Gn(ǫ) =1+i∆2
γGn+1(ǫ)
G−1
0n(ǫ)+i∆2
γ. (35)
Visually the recursion procedure (35) has nothing in common with pro cedure (17), leading to continuous – fraction
representation of Ggiven by Eq. (18). However, direct numerical calculations show tha t both produce absolutely
same results for the physical Green’s function Gn=0(ǫ) (in the limit of initial “storey” N→ ∞).
Forγ= 0 in the limit of ω0→0 Eq. (28) immediately reduces to diﬀerential equation (6) for the G reen’s function
in the usual Keldysh model, as lim
ω0→0G(ǫ+ω0)−G(ǫ)
ω0= lim
ω0→0G(ǫ−ω0)−G(ǫ)
−ω0=dG(ǫ)
dǫ. Green’s function G(ǫ) is analytic in
the upper half – plane of complex energy ǫand the derivativedG(ǫ)
dǫgives the same result along diﬀerent directions of
dǫin this half – plane. Thus for other order of limits ω0= 0,γ→0 from Eq. (28) we again obtain the diﬀerential
equation (6). Analyticity of the Green’s function allows to write it (in t he upper half – plane of ǫ) as:
G(ǫ) =/integraldisplay∞
−∞dǫ′ρ(ǫ′)

whereρ(ǫ) =−1
πImG(ǫ) is the spectral density (density of states for the quantum dot) . Then in this limit in Eq.

Analytic properties of Green’s function (36) allow to reduce the fun ctional equation (29) to integral equation for
spectral density ρ(ǫ). Let us rewrite functional equation (29) as:
G(ǫ) =/tildewideG0(ǫ)−/tildewideG0(ǫ)∆2

B. Exact solution for the Green’s function in the form of inﬁn ite series
Eq. (38) can be solved by iterations starting from /tildewideG0(ǫ). If we represent the result of each iteration as simple
fractions (so that there are no ǫin the coeﬃcients), one can easily convince himself, that the Green’s function G
becomes the sum of /tildewideG0(ǫ+(n−m)ω0+(n+m)iγ), where nandmare integers, with coeﬃcients independent of ǫ.
Thus we look for the solution for the Green’s function in the following f orm:

where coeﬃcients Anmare independent of ǫand can be found substituting (42) into (38). Then we have:

The problem of an electron in Gaussian ﬁeld of dynamic ﬂuctuations wit h ﬁnite correlation time has much in
common with the problem of Holstein polaron in semiconductors with low mobility, i.e. with the problem of ﬁnding
the single electron Green’s function in Holstein model [23] of an electr on interacting with optical phonon mode with
frequency Ω in the limit of transfer integral between nearest neigh borst→0 (t≪Ω). Usually such problem is
analyzed by making Lang – Firsov canonical transformation [24] in Ho lstein Hamiltonian [23] However, the diagram
technique for electron – phonon interaction in this model is complete ly equivalent to diagram technique in our model
of dynamical ﬂuctuations with ﬁnite correlation time after the repla cement:
∆→g iγ→ −Ω (60)
wheregis electron – phonon coupling constant. We only have to take into acc ount that in this diagram technique in
the denominators of electron Green’s functions we have continuou s addition −Ω terms instead of iγ, because of two
terms in phonon propagator:
D(ω) =1
ω−Ω+iδ−1
ω+Ω−iδ(61)
only the ﬁrst term contribute to frequency integralsdue to the fa ct that all electronicGreen’s functions in this problem
are retarded.
Thusthe Green’sfunctionofHolsteinpolaron(for t→0)isdeterminedbycontinuousfraction(18)withreplacement
(60). For the ﬁrst time Holstein polaron Green’s function of this for m was derived in Ref. [25]. Our series expression
for the Green’s function (57) in the model of dynamical ﬂuctuation s with ﬁnite correlation time immediately allows
us to get (after the replacement (60)) the well known exact resu lt for the Green’s function of Holstein polaron as

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
Now for the most general model of ﬂuctuations with ﬁnite frequen cy and correlation time we actually have three
exact numerical procedures to ﬁnd the Green’s function:
1. recursive procedure (34),
2. integral equation for spectral density (41),
3. series representation (51).
For the wide range of parameters (∆, γ,ω0) of the model our numerical calculations showed that all three pro cedures
lead to absolutely same results for spectral density (density of st ates). Of these, the recursion procedure (34) is most
fast for numerics, though for small values of γ≪∆,ω0andω0<0.3∆ it requires signiﬁcant increase of the number
of energies in corresponding array and the number of an initial “sto rey” to start, while series representation (51) in
this range of parameters is well convergent. However, the series representation is inappropriate for direct numerical
analysis in the region of ∆ ≫γ > ω0, which is connected both with large values of the exponent before t he series and
with the large number of terms in the series to be taken into account to compensate this exponent.
Now let us discuss our numerical results. In Fig.7 we demonstrate ev olution of the spectral density with increasing
γ(i.e. with decreasing correlation time of ﬂuctuations) for the model withω0= 0. For γ= 0 (in the usual Keldysh
model) spectral density is Gaussian with the width ∆ (dispersion – ∆2). The growth of γleads to decrease of
characteristic width of the spectral density with appropriate gro wth ofρ(0).
In Fig. 8 we show spectral densities (densities of states in quantum dot) in the model with ﬁnite transferred
frequency for ∆ = 1 and diﬀerent values of ω0andγ. We can see that in all cases for small γsigniﬁcant modulations
of the spectral density appear with frequency ω0with peaks of spectral density appearing at energies ǫ=±nω0, where
nis integer. The height of these peaks decreases with increasing nand forǫ >3∆ peaks are practically invisible.
Increasing γleadstodecreasingpeakheightsandstartingfromsomevaluesof γmodulationswithfrequency ω0become
unobservable. Further increase of γonly somehow narrows Gaussian – like spectral density, as it was obs erved in
Fig.7 for the model with ω0= 0. At large enough values of γ, when no modulations of spectral density with frequency13

FIG. 8 Spectral density (density of states) of the quantum do t in the model with ﬁnite transfer frequency and relaxation t ime
for ∆ = 1 and diﬀerent values of ω0andγ.
ω0are observed, the growth of ω0only weakly changes the spectral density (see Fig.8f) and we can us e more simple
model with ω0= 0. Note that the values of γ, for which modulations of spectral density are observable depend s on
ω0. In particular, for ω0= 0.1 (Fig.8a) modulations are observed only for γ= 0.0001, while for ω0= 0.5 (Fig.8c)
modulations are observable already for γ= 0.05.
As was already noted above it is not diﬃcult to generalize our model to consider not a single quantum well in
dynamical random ﬁelds, but electron in crystal lattice of ddimensions (in the following we take lattice parameter
a≡1) with transfer integral between nearest neighbors t, which is placed in a capacitor, with noise created at
its plates, the same for all lattice sites. This ﬁeld is thus constant in s pace and the electron momentum is not
changed during scattering, so that the account of electron hops between lattice sites is taken into account by a simple
replacement ǫ→ǫ−ǫp, whereǫpis band – like spectrum of electrons with quasimomentum p. In such a model the14

FIG. 11 Densityof states ofthree –dimensional system with i nitial semi –elliptic density ofstates with bandwidth W= 2D= 1
for diﬀerent ∆, ω0andγ.
To analyze three – dimensional case we use as the “bare” the model semi – elliptic density of states:
N0d3(ǫ) =2
πD2/radicalbig
D2−ǫ2, (70)
whereDis the band half – width. This model guarantees the valid ∼ǫ1/2“bare” density of states behavior near the
band edges for d= 3. Full densities of states in this model for initial bandwidth W= 2D= 1 and diﬀerent values of
random ﬁeld parameters are shown in Fig.11.
Thus in all these models for small values of γwe can observe modulations of the density of states with fre-
quencyω0. Increasing γleads to sharp weakening of these modulations. The growth of rand om ﬁeld amplitude ∆
(Figs.9,10,11a,b,c) leads to some increase of modulations amplitude and weakening of singularities (Van - Hove, at
band edges etc..), related to the “bare” density of states. For ∆ = W(Figs.9,10,11c) density of states pratically
“forgets” the bare one. Increase of spatial dimensionality dleads to weakening of the modulations.
In one – dimensional chain (Fig.9) for ω0= 0.5 peaks at ǫ=±ω0coincide with band – edges, where the bare density17
of states (68) diverges, while the peak at ǫ= 0 appears at the minimum of the bare density of states. Thus the p eaks
atǫ=±ω0are eﬀectively increased and can can become larger than the weake ned peak at ǫ= 0 (Fig.9a,b,e). This
mutual inﬂuence of divergence in the bare density of states at the bad edges in one dimension and modulations with
frequency ω0leads to signiﬁcant changes if the amplitude and shape of central pe ak (atǫ= 0) with small changes of
ω0close toω0= 0.5 (Fig.9d,e,f).
For two – dimensional lattice Van - Hove divergence is at the band cen ter, and central peak of modulations is always
signiﬁcantly larger than peaks at ǫ=±ω0and its shape is only weakly changes with small variations of ω0close to
ω0= 0.5 (Fig.10d,e,f).
For three – dimensional model modulations in the density of states w ith frequency ω0are weak enough and for
ω0= 0.5even a small dip is observedin the density ofstates in the middle of th e band (at ǫ= 0) (Fig.11a,b,c,e). Small
variations of ω0close toω0= 0.5 signiﬁcantly change the shape of this weak feature at the band ce nter (Fig.11d,e,f).
VI. CONCLUSIONS
Our analysis shows a plenty of new and interesting results, which can be derived even for this simple enough version
of the generalized dynamical Keldysh model for the case of random ﬁelds with ﬁnite transferred frequency. It seems
obvious that this model can have a direct relation to situations realiz ed in real systems with quantum dots, which
are used in diﬀerent microelectronic devices, while the frequency ω0can be related to the clock frequency of these
devices. Of course, the current simplest model is oversimpliﬁed, bu t one can hope that the results obtained can be
useful also for the analysis of processes in realistic devices.
The question ofexperimental realizationofour model remainsopen . In principle, the studies ofquantum dots in the
specially created (e.g. by electrotechnical means) random ﬁeld see ms quite feasible, though parameters of interaction
with this are to be specially chosen to make the results discussed abo ve observable. All this is also directly related to
electronic systems (lattices) of diﬀerent dimensionalities placed in a r andom ﬁeld created on “capacitor” plates.
In real physical systems dynamical random ﬁelds can be created e .g. by phonons in the classical limit, when the
temperature is much larger than the characteristic frequency of these phonons ω0. For example, we can consider
electron scattering at the interface of metallic ﬁlm and dielectric sub strate. It is well known that scattering with small
transferred momenta (almost “forward” scattering) can appea r at the interface of metallic monolayer of FeSe on the
substrate made of ionic SrTiO 3insulator [26], which leads to interesting models of superconductivity enhancement in
this system [27]. Unfortunately we can not apply the analysis given ab ove to this system, because the frequency of
optical phonon in SrTiO 3is pretty high and it can not be considered as classical (external ra ndom ﬁeld). However,
we can not exclude the existence of similar systems (structures) w ith “soft” enough optical phonons.
As was already noted above, the model with a single quantum well is dir ectly generalized to the case of several
wells [18; 19], leading to Keldysh model with multicomponent noise. In pa rticular, the model with two wells is closely
related (in the variant with band electrons) to the exactly solvable m odel of pseudogap state [7–12]. Diﬀerent models
of this kind were actively used to describe the pseudogap, appearin g due to electron scattering by ﬂuctuations of short
– range order in one – dimensional models [6–12], which were also gene ralized for two – dimensional case to describe
pseudogap in high – temperature superconductors [13–17]. In mo st of these papers only scattering by quasi static
ﬂuctuations was considered. It is of great interest to generalize t hese models for the case of dynamical ﬂuctuations
with ﬁnite transferred frequency, created by appropriate “sof t” modes. However, it is clear that analysis of such
models requires further development of methods used in this paper . We hope to perform such studies in some future.18
