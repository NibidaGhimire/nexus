Motivated by recent experimental evidences signalling the chiral charge order in the vanadium-
based kagome superconductors, we theoretically investiga te the impact of the chiral ﬂux charge
order over the experimental outcomes for the normal and the S C properties. It is revealed that
the spectral weight on the Fermi surface (FS) is partially ga ped by the chiral ﬂux charge order
with the reservation of the spectral weight on the Mpoints and the midpoint between the two
adjacent Mpoints, resulting in the momentum-dependent energy gap bei ng consistent with the
recent experimental observations. More importantly, by co nsidering the inﬂuence of the chiral ﬂux
charge order, we ﬁnd that a conventional fully gapped SC pair ing state evolves into a nodal gap
feature for the spectral weight due to the spectral gap modul ations on the FS. As a result, the
U-shaped density of states (DOS) deforms to the V-shaped one along with the residual DOS near
the Fermi energy. These results bear some resemblance to the experimental observations, and may
serve as a promising proposal to mediate the divergent or see mingly contradictory experimental
outcomes about the SC pairing symmetry.

I. INTRODUCTION
The recent discovery of superconductivity in a family
of compounds AV 3Sb5(A=K, Rb, Cs), which share a
common lattice structure with kagome net of vanadium
atoms, hastriggeredanewsurgeofinterestintheinvesti-
gation of superconductivity1–37. The fascinating aspects
of these materials lie in the exotic quantum physics as
they integrate with the geometrical lattice frustration,
the van Hove ﬁlling, the nontrivial band topology, and
the interplay between the charge density wave and su-
perconductivity12,38–41, which makes the emergence of
superconductivity in these materials is in themselves ex-
otic and rare.
A central issue about the superconductivity is to un-
veil the superconducting (SC) pairing mechanism. To
search for clues to this puzzling question, the deter-
mination of the pairing symmetry of the SC order pa-
rameter is thought to be a prerequisite step. However,
the inconsistent or even contradicting results have been
found so far in experimental measurements and data
analyses. The temperature dependence of the nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate shows a Hebel-Slichter coher-
ence peak just below Tc, indicating that CsV 3Sb5is a
conventional s-wave superconductor15. The penetration
depth measurements also lend support to such a view16.
Nevertheless, the measurements of thermal conductivity
on CsV 3Sb5at ultra-low temperature evidenced a ﬁnite
residual linear term, pointing to an unconventional nodal
SCgap17. Inaccordancewith this, theV-shapedSCgaps
with residual zero-energy density of states (DOS) also
suggest an anisotropic SC gap with nodes12–14. More-
over, the scanning tunnelling microscope/spectroscopy
(STM/STS) experiment on CsV 3Sb5at ultra-low tem-
perature revealed a two-gap structure with multiple setsof coherent peaks and residual zero-energy DOS, accom-
panied by the magnetic/non-magnetic impurity eﬀects,
implying a rather novel and interesting SC gap, i.e.,
the sign preservedmultiband superconductivity with gap
nodes13.
Theoretically, the resultsaboutthe pairingsymmetries
vary widely as well, depending on the diﬀerent methods
and models. Early before the discovery of the supercon-
ductivityin AV 3Sb5, whileachiral dx2−y2+idxy-waveSC
state was predicted to be the most favorable one within
a reasonable parameter range for the van Hove ﬁlling
kagome system based on the variational cluster approach
and the perturbative renormalization group analysis to
a single-orbital Hubbard model38,39, the singular-mode
functionalrenormalizationgrouptheorydiscoveredarich
varietyofelectronic instabilities rangingform s-waveand
d-wave to dx2−y2+idxy-wave superconductivities under
short-range interactions40. Later on, with the inspira-
tion from the discovery of superconductivity in the fam-
ily of AV 3Sb5, a random phase approximation based on
a two-orbital model revealed an f-wave pairing instabil-
ity over a large range of coupling strength, succeeded by
d-wave singlet pairing for stronger coupling42. On the
other hand, the determinant quantum Monte Carlo cal-
culations on the kagome-lattice Hubbard model found
the dominating pairing channel was dx2−y2+idxy(sex)-
wave in the hole (electron)-doped case43. What is more,
it has been uncovered that the mechanism of bond-order
ﬂuctuations could give rise to both singlet s-wave and
tripletp-wave superconductivity44. Nevertheless, the ex-
perimental controversy concerning the SC pairing sym-
metry in the family of AV 3Sb5remains unsettled.
One of the reasons for the divergent experimental out-
comeslies in that the SC ordermayintertwinewith other
unconventional electron orders, adding another layer of2
complexity to this already challenging issue in the ﬁeld.
Although the possibility of long-range magnetic order
in the AV 3Sb5crystal has been ruled out by the neu-
tron scattering45and muon spin spectroscopy46measure-
ments, a giant anomalous Hall eﬀect has still been ob-
served above the entrance of the SC state with the con-
comitant onset of a 2 ×2 charge density wave (CDW) or-
der2,9, indicating this time-reversal symmetry-breaking
transition derives primarily from the charge degree of
freedom46. So far, there are an increasing number of
experimental evidences supporting that the CDW state
has a 2×2 chiral ﬂux order8,27,37,47–53. Furthermore, the
muon spin relaxation technic observed a noticeable en-
hancement of the internal ﬁeld width, which takes place
just below the charge ordering temperature and persists
into the SC state47, pointing to time-reversal symmetry-
breaking charge order intertwining with unconventional
superconductivity. Thus, the chiral CDW should be con-
sidered in analyzing the SC properties in the vanadium-
based kagome superconductors.
Given the fairly good Fermi surface (FS) nesting and
proximity to the von Hove singularity, the system is
prone to the instability of “triple- Q” CDW at the three
nesting wave vectors54–62. While the real component
of the “triple- Q” bond charge order conforms to the
modulated superlattice pattern uncovered in the exper-
iments, the theoretical proposal of “triple- Q” imaginary
CDWs, which was originally put forward on the hon-
eycomb and triangular lattices54,55, appears consistent
simultaneously with the superlattice modulations and
the time-reversal symmetry breaking. Subsequently, var-
ious chiral ﬂux phases with diﬀerent conﬁgurations of
orbital current have been proposed in a series of theo-
retical studies on the kagome superconductors56–61. A
recent self-consistent mean-ﬁeld study has shown that
the chiral CDW in Fig. 1(a) can be stabilized by moder-
atelysmallintersiteCoulombinteractionsanditmightbe
the most relevant time-reversal symmetry-breaking state
in AV 3Sb563. In addition, the coexistence of the chiral
CDWwithaconventionalfullygappedsuperconductivity
could lead to gapless edge modes on the domains of the
lattice symmetry breaking order61. These edge modes
with gapless excitations could account for the residual
DOS and the ﬁnite residual thermal conductivity. How-
ever, there is still lack of a systematic investigation on
the direct inﬂuence of the chiral CDW over the SC pair-
ing properties, especially when one considers the growing
experimental evidences pointing to the persistence of the
time-reversal symmetry-breaking CDW well into the SC
state8,37,64.
In this paper, we aim to ﬁll up the blank by showing
that the chiral ﬂux phase in Fig. 1(a) as a representative
of the time-reversal symmetry-breaking 2 ×2 CDW has
a profound impact on the experimental outcomes with
respect to both the normal and the SC properties. By
unfolding the spectral weight function and the energy
bands to the primitive Brillouin zone (PBZ), we show
that only portions of the FS are gaped by the CDW or-der. While the original band near the saddle point is
split into three sub-bands by the CDW order, three new
saddle points emerge in the CDW phase, and especially
there is still an obvious residual saddle-point spectrum
at the Fermi level. Importantly, the novelty we discov-
ered in the calculations is such that a conventional fully
gapped SC pairing state will acquire a nodal gap feature
for the spectral weight on the FS when the impact of the
chiral ﬂux CDW order is taken into account. The nodal
gap feature manifests itself as the evolution from the U-
shaped DOS to the V-shaped one along with the residual
DOS near the Fermi energy, which is the direct outcome
of the charge order induced gap modulations of the spec-
tral function on the FS. These results not only account
for some experimental observations, but also provide an
alternative scenario to reconcile the divergent or seem-
ingly contradictory experimental outcomes regarding the
SC pairing symmetry.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Sec. II, we introduce the model Hamiltonian and carry
out analytical calculations. In Sec. III, we present nu-
merical calculations and discuss the results. In Sec. IV,
we make a conclusion.
II. MODEL AND METHOD
The 2×2 CDW order quadruply enlarges the unit cell,
as indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 1(a). Among
the possible time-reversal symmetry-breaking charge or-
der conﬁgurations, the chiral ﬂux phase with conﬁg-
uration of the orbital current shown in Fig. 1(a) has
been found to be energetically favorable59. Thus, we
adopt this typical CDW conﬁguration as a represen-
tative of the demonstration, and leave other possibil-
ities for future researches. It is widely believed that
the inter-scattering between three van Hove points with
wave vectors Qa= (0,2π/√
3),Qb= (−π,−π/√
3) and
Qc= (π,−π/√
3) causes the CDW in AV 3Sb5[The wave
vectors are shown in Fig. 1(b).]. Meanwhile, the van
Hove ﬁlling was also proposed to be crucial to the super-
conductivity in AV 3Sb5. A single orbital tight binding
model near the van Hove ﬁlling produces the essential
feature of the FS and the van Hove physics. Therefore,
to capture the main physics of the topological CDW and
its impacts on the SC in AV 3Sb5, we adopt a minimum
single orbital model.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Spectral weight distribution and energy gap for
the chiral ﬂux phase
In this section, we investigate the low-energy spectral
weight distribution and the energy gap in the chiral ﬂux4
phase. In the calculations, the chemical potential µis
tuned so as to ﬁx the band ﬁlling at 1 /6 hole doping, i.e.,
thevanHoveﬁlling, whichfacilitatestheinter-scatterings
between three van Hove singularities with wave vectors
Qa,b,c. The scatterings of the charge order, on the one
hand, deplete the spectral weight on some portions of
the FS, as shown in Fig. 1(c) for the low-energy ( E= 0)
spectral weight distribution that is calculated directly in
the PBZ. On the other hand, they fold the three bands
in the PBZ of the PUC into the reduced Brillouin zone
(RBZ) of the EUC, forming the twelve bands in the RBZ
as presented in Fig. 1(d). Nevertheless, the results cal-
culated straightly in the PBZ contain extra folded seg-
ments of spectral weight and energy bands [see Fig. 1(c),
Fig. 3(b) and Fig. A1 for reference], and thus hinder the
direct comparison to the original band structure or the
experimental spectra in ARPES. Therefore, in the fol-
lowing, we will employ an unfolding procedure to recover
the band structures and the spectral weights in the PBZ.
FIG. 1: (a) The lattice structure of the kagome superconduc-
tors, made out of three sublattices A(green dots), B(red
dots) and C(blue dots). The arrows on the lattice depict
the conﬁguration of the orbital current, and the dashed line s
denote the enlarged unit cell. (b) Fermi surface produced
by the spectral weight distribution A0(k,E) at zero energy
E= 0. (c) The spectral weight distribution A(k,E) at zero
energyE= 0 obtained in the 2 ×2 chiral ﬂux phase with
λ= 0.1. The hexagonal area in (c) surrounded by the white
dashed lines shows the reduced Brillouin zone in the 2 ×2
chiral ﬂux phase. (d) The dispersion of the chiral ﬂux phase
along high-symmetry cuts in the reduced Brillouin zone for a
typical value of λ= 0.1.
In Figs. 2(a) and (b), we show the unfolded spectral
weight distribution A(k,E) atE= 0 in the chiral ﬂux
phase for λ= 0.02 andλ= 0.1, respectively. In or-
der to get a better view about the changes of the spec-
tral weights for diﬀerent λ, Fig. 2(c) also displays the
unfolded spectral distribution along the momentum cutfrom (π,−√
3π/3) to (π,√
3π/3) direction. As can be
seen from the ﬁgures, the CDW scatterings not only de-
press the spectral weight and open the CDW gap on the
FS, but also make the depression exhibit distinct mo-
mentum dependence. While the most depressed portion
occurs near the Mpoints for a weak λand extends to-
ward the midpoint of two adjacent Mpoints with the
increase of λ, a ﬁnite strength of spectral weight still re-
mains around the midpoint and at the Mpoints within
the reasonable parameter regime λ≤0.5. Remarkably,
the strength of spectral weightat the Mpoints converges
to a lower limit of one third of the intensity with the in-
crease of λ, and accordingly a round spot, much like a
van Hove singularity, with almost constant intensity of
spectral weight appears at the Mpoints.
FIG. 2: The unfolded spectral weight distribution A(k,E) at
E= 0 in the primitive Brillouin zone for λ= 0.02 (a) and
λ= 0.1 (b), respectively. The dashed orange arrow in (a) in-
dicates the momentum cut from ( π,−√
3π/3) to (π,√
3π/3)
direction. (c) The momentum distribution curves of the spec -
tral weight along the momentum cut shown by the dashed
orange arrow in (a) for diﬀerent λ. The dashed line in (c)
portrays one third of the intensity of λ= 0. (d) Evolution of
the CDW gap along the momentum cut shown by the dashed
orange arrow in (a) for diﬀerent λ.
As a result of the momentum-dependent scatterings of
the charge order, the CDW gap acquires the strong mo-
mentum dependence. Fig. 2(d) presents the CDW gaps
for diﬀerent λalong the momentum cut shown by the
dashed orange arrow in Fig. 2(a), which are extracted
from the spectral peak positions in the momentum-
energy space. It is obvious that the CDW gap on the FS
is anisotropic, with its zero minimum at the Mpoints
and at the midpoint of two adjacent Mpoints, but ex-
hibiting a maximum in the middle of these two zero min-
imums. We notice that the anisotropic CDW gap, in-
cluding the positions of minimum and maximum, agrees5
with the ARPES observations very well33.

(the black solid curve). The dashed line is the Fermi level
corresponding to the van Hove ﬁlling. (d) Density of states i n
the small energy scale for λ= 0.05 andλ= 0.1 in the chiral

Consideringthefactthatthethreescatteringwavevec-
tors connect the adjacent van Hove singular points ( M
points), the zero-energy van Hove singularity-like spot at
theMpoints in the CDW state with the lower limit of
intensity being exactly one third of that in the normal
state is very intriguing and worth further clariﬁcation.
It would be much more sensible to get insight from the
physics of the three van Hove singular points at van Hove
ﬁlling, where each of them comes exclusively from one of
thethreeinequivalentlatticesitesinthenormalstate38,65
and aremutually coupled by the CDWorderin the chiral
ﬂux phase. According to the conﬁguration of the orbital
current in Fig. 1(a), the low-energy eﬀective theory at
theMpoint for the CDW state is well described by the
patch model55,57,66,
HCDW(M) =
εMAiλ iλ
−iλ εMB−iλ
−iλ iλ ε MC
,(12)
whereεMA(εMB,εMC) stands for the energy at the van
Hove singular point MA(MB,MC) that originates from
the sublattice A(B,C). At the van Hove ﬁlling with
εMA=εMB=εMC= 0, one can immediately ﬁnd three
eigenstates for the Hamiltonian HCDW(M) with respec-
tive eigenvalues E0(M) = 0 and E±(M) =±√
3λ, andeach of these three eigenstates weights one third of the
total probability. This is to say the zero-energy state at
van Hove singular point Mtriply splits into three energy
states with each of them possessing one third of the total
spectral weights.
Interestingly, the very simple argument is indeed em-
bodied in the momentum distribution curves of the un-
foldedspectralweightand theunfolded energydispersion
in momentum space along high-symmetry cuts shown re-
spectively in Figs. 2(c) and 3(a). As illustrated in these
ﬁgures, the original band near the upper saddle point is
triply split by the charge order scatterings to the upper,
middle and lower branches, where the middle one char-
acterizes a new saddle-shaped band just at the Fermi
energy with its spectral weight approaching one third of
that in the normal state. By contrast, the Dirac point
around the Kpoint remains nearly intact upon entering
the chiral ﬂux phase. For comparison, we also present
the folded energy band dispersion of the chiral ﬂux phase
along the high-symmetry cuts in the PBZ in Fig. 3(b).
More detailed energy band changes with λcan be found
in Appendix A. As a result, the eﬀect of a weak chiral
ﬂux charge order on the DOS mainly concentrates on the
near-by energies of the van Hove singularity, as can be
seenby makinga comparisonbetweenthe blacksolidand
the red dotted curves in Fig. 3(c) and in Fig. 3(d) for the
enlarged view of the low energy DOS. This implies the
orbital current order would have a profound impact on
the SC properties, which have been proposed to derive
beneﬁt from the van Hove singularities.
Thus far, we havedemonstrated that the proposed chi-
ral ﬂux CDW phase for the kagome superconductors ex-
hibits some typical features, including the momentum-
dependentpartialgapopeningatFermienergy, theemer-
gence of the new saddle point at the Mpoint and the
unchanged Dirac point as well, which are all in good ac-
cordance with the experimental observations22,33,67. It is
worth pointing out that the unique change of the spec-
tral function from the normal state to the CDW state
can be used as an indirect evidence to identify the time-
reversal symmetry-breaking CDW state. For the CDW
state with time-reversal symmetry, the oﬀ-diagonal ele-
ments in Eq. (12) are real, which leads to the band at
Mpoint splitting into only two sub-bands with unequal
spectral weights.
B. Modulated s-wave SC pairing and nodal gap
Having analyzed the spectral and gap features of the
chiral ﬂux CDW phase, we now pursue the main ques-
tion of the paper, i.e., the impact of the chiral ﬂux order
on the SC properties. In the calculations, the SC or-
der parameter is determined self-consistently by treating
the orbital current order λas a variable argument. In
Figs. 4(a)-(e), we present the intensity plots of the spec-
tral function in the coexistence of orbital current and SC
orders as functions of energy and momentum along the6

state for diﬀerent strength of λ= 0 (a), λ= 0.01 (b),λ=

cut shown as the dashed orange arrow in Fig. 2(a). For
λ= 0 in Fig. 4(a), the intensity of the spectral func-
tion shows a gap edge structure at constant energy, from
which an isotropic gap feature indicated by the black
solid line in Fig. 4(f) can be extracted on the FS as a
function of θkF, with the angle of the Fermi momentum
θkFbeing deﬁned in Fig. 1(b). Correspondingly, one can
see a typical U-shaped full gap structure for the DOS in
Figs. 5(a)-(e), where the DOS for λ= 0 is plotted with
the black curve in all panels for reference.
Inclusion of a small value of λ, say for example λ <
0.02, has little bearing on the SC pairing amplitude ∆
[see Fig. 5(f)], but has an obvious eﬀect on the the spec-
tral function distribution and the line shape of DOS.
Speciﬁcally, the introduction of a tiny value ofthe orbital
current order, such as λ= 0.01, will cause the red-shift
of the gap edge. As the CDW order partially gaps the
FS with the utmost strength of the scattering occurring
at theMpoints, the SC softening is expected to start
from the Mpoints. This is evidenced by the drawing in
Fig. 4(b), where the shift is clearly visible to begin at
theMpoints, and reach its minimum at the midpoint of
the momentum cut, leading to the modulation of the gap
on the FS, as displayed by the blue curve in Fig. 4(f).
As a result, the DOS changes its U-shaped curve to abasin-like one along with the slightly blunted gap edges,
as depicted by the red curve in Fig. 5(a).
Whereas the position of the gap edge at the midpoint
of the momentum cut shifts slightly toward lower ener-
gies with the increase of λ, it decreases signiﬁcantly at
theMpoints, as illustrated in Figs. 4(b)-(c). As is seen
in Fig. 4(f), the striking contrast of the gap edge shifts
between the Mpoints and the midpoint results in the
deeper modulation depth of the spectral gap on the FS
with a stronger orbital current order. Consequently, one
can expect the appearance of the gap nodes on the FS
whentheorbitalcurrentorderreachesacertainlevelsuch
asλ∼0.03. Further increase in the orbital current or-
der will remove the gap nodes by lifting the quasiparticle
energies around the Mpoints on one hand, and on the
other hand it pushes the energies downward on the por-
tion between the Mpoint and the midpoint [see Fig. 4(f)
forλ= 0.035]. As a result, the period ofthe gap modula-
tion on the FS becomes shorter than that of the smaller
λ, and leads to the doubling of the nodal portions on
the FS as the orbital current order achieving to about
λ= 0.04, as is shown in Fig. 4(f). It is noteworthy that
the results with sign preserved nodal gap we identiﬁed
here come to the same conclusion with the experiment13.
With the increase of λ, the line shape of the DOS fol-
lows the corresponding changes with the spectral weight
function. On one hand, accompanied by the decrease of
the SC pairing amplitude ∆ [see Fig. 5(f)], the basin-
like DOS is continually deformed to a V-shaped one by
the increase of λ, as evidenced in Figs. 5(b)-(d). On the
other hand, the appearance of multiple sets of gap edge
peak can be clearly seen in Figs. 5(b)-(d) for λ≥0.02.
Moreover, as λis increased, there exists residual DOS at
zero energy in Figs. 5(c) and (d). The V-shaped DOS
with multiple sets of gap edge peak and residual zero-
energy DOS constitutes a characteristic of a nodal multi-
gap SC pairing state. Although a single orbital tight-
binding model and the conventional on-site s-wave SC
pairing are adopted here, it is very interesting that the
salient features such as the V-shaped DOS, the residual
zero-energy DOS as well as the multiple sets of gap edge
peak produced in the coexistence of orbital current order
and SC pairing are in good accordance with the STM
experiments12–14.
As the orbital current order increases to λ∼0.05,
the system is driven to the phase of dominant CDW or-
der by heavily suppressing the SC pairing amplitude [see
Fig. 5(f)]. Accordingly, the DOS for λ= 0.05 presented
in Fig. 5(e) turns to the result in Fig. 3(d) for the pure
chiralﬂux phase. The result suggeststhat the strengthof
the orbital currentorderneeds to be treated with caution
when one studies the interplay between the SC and or-
bital current order in a non-self-consistent manner61, be-
cause the superconductivity would be totally suppressed
by even the moderate orbital current order.
Clariﬁcation of the interplay between the time-reversal
symmetry-breaking charge orders and superconductivity
is a key step toward the understanding of the underly-7

ing physics of the V-based kagome superconductors. Al-
though the competition nature between them has been
identiﬁed in these materials, there is accumulating evi-
dence that also shows a coexistence of them. It has been
observed that the CDW in AV 3Sb5intertwined with SC
order could result in the spatial modulations of the SC
gap, i.e., the so called roton pair-density wave state12. In
thispaper, wehavedemonstratedthattheorbitalcurrent
order can lead to the gap modulations on the FS. While
the spatial modulations of the gap have been probed by
means of STM/STS measurement, the gap modulations
on the FS can be discernable in the ARPES and ﬁeld
angle-dependent thermal conductivity measurements for
identifying the interplay between the CDW and the SC
orders, and for verifying or falsifying the above scenario.
Whether there is a relationship between the gap modula-
tionsontheFS inthepresentstudyandtheexperimental
observations of the roton pair-density wave, or if there is
a possibility that the orbital current ordercould also lead
to some spatial modulations of the SC pairing, constitute
the fascinating questions deserving further studies.
IV. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have studied the impact of the chiral
ﬂux CDW order on the experimental outcomes for the
normal and the SC properties. With the aids of the un-
folding procedure to the PBZ, it was revealed that a newsaddle point turns up at Mpoints near the Fermi energy
to form the van Have singularity-like spectral spots in
the CDW phase, despite that the original band near the
Fermi energy could be gaped by the CDW order. The
band gap was manifested in the partially gaped spectral
weight on the FS with the reservation of the spectral
weight on the Mpoints and the midpoint between the
two adjacent Mpoints. In the environment of the par-
tially gaped FS and the new van Have singularity-like
spot, a conventional fully gapped SC pairing would have
a chance to survive in the coexistence of the chiral ﬂux
CDW and SC orders, at the expense of the spectral gap
modulations on the FS. Owing to the modulations of the
gap, a nodal gap feature for the spectral weight might
appear on the FS under certain strengths of the CDW
order. Accordingly, the U-shaped DOS deformed to the
V-shapedonealongwiththeresidualDOSneartheFermi
energy. These results were concordant with the experi-
mental observations in many aspects, and might serve as
a proposal to mediate the divergent or seemingly contra-
dictory experimental outcomes with respect to the SC
pairing symmetry.

Appendix A: Folded and unfolded band structures
for diﬀerent λ
In Fig. A1, we present the folded band structures and
the unfolded dispersionof the spectral weightalong high-
symmetry cuts in the PBZ for the chiral ﬂux phase with
diﬀerent λ. First of all, the triple splitting of the en-
ergy band near the van Hove points happens for all cases
with the splitting being proportional to the charge or-
der strength λ(Note that the triple splitting is obviously
weakenedatthelowervanHovepointduetothenon-zero
energy of this point and the mixing contributions from
diﬀerent sublattices.). Secondly, the low energy portion
alongthe Γ to Kdirectionremainsintact when the CDW
order is not too strong such as λ≤0.1, but it is gapped
by the strong CDW order with λ= 0.2 andλ= 0.3 with
the upper branch just touching the Fermi level, which
clearly manifest in Figs. A1(b), (d), (f) and (h) for the
unfolded spectral dispersion. Besides, the Dirac bands
near the Kpoint always maintain the same basic feature
for the parameters considered here.
