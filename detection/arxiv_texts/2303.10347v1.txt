Abstract
We ﬁnd all non-abelian generalizations of P1−P6Painlev´ e systems such that the
corresponding autonomous system obtained by freezing the i ndependent variable is in-
tegrable. All these systems have isomonodromic Lax represe ntations.
Keywords: non-abelian ODEs, Painlev´ e equations, isomono dromic Lax pairs
1 Introduction
The famous six Painlev´ e equations play a signiﬁcant role in modern mathematical physics.
The interest in their non-commutative extensions was motiv ated by the needs of modern
quantum physics as well as by natural attempts of mathematic ians to extend “classical”
structures to the non-commutative case.
In the paper [ 14], the Painlev´ e equations were written as polynomial syste ms of the form


f(z)du
dz=P1(u,v)+zQ1(u,v),
f(z)dv
dz=P2(u,v)+zQ2(u,v),(1)
wheref(z) =z(z−1)for theP6system,f(z) =zin theP5andP3cases and f(z) = 1
for remaining types of Painlev´ e systems. The right-hand si des of systems depend on several
arbitrary parameters κi.
We consider systems of the form ( 1), where Pi,Qiare polynomials with constant scalar
coeﬃcients in non-commutative variables uandv. For simplicity, we regard these variables as
matrices of an arbitrary size m1. We assume that if m= 1then the system ( 1) coincides with
one of the six Painlev´ e systems P1−P6. Some examples of integrable non-abelian systems
of the form ( 1) are contained in [ 12,4,3,7,15,1,2]. Some of them were found using the
existence of special isomonodromy representations or the P ainlev´ e-Kovalevskaya test while
several of the systems have been derived from integrable PDE s and lattices by reductions.
Classiﬁcation papers [ 4,3,7] devoted to systems of P1,P2,andP4were based on the ma-
trix Painlev´ e-Kovalevskaya test. Unfortunately, for the P3,P5,andP6systems this approach
turns out to be too laborious. Мoreover, in this approach it i s essential that the variables
uandvare matrices. In [ 6] a diﬀerent integrability criterion based on the existence of a
non-abelian Okamoto integral was used. As a result, a collec tion of new non-abelian systems
ofP3,P5,andP6type was obtained. However, some of known non-abelian syste ms do not
have the Okamoto integral.

1Using the non-abelian formalism (see, for example, [ 13]), all considerations can be trivially generalized to
the non-abelian case. For this reason, in this paper we do not distinguish “matrix” and “non-abelian” systems.
1In this paper we propose an approach related to properties of the autonomous system


du
dt=P1(u,v)+zQ1(u,v),
dv
dt=P2(u,v)+zQ2(u,v),(2)
obtained from system ( 1) by freezing the independent variable. In system ( 2) we treat zas
a parameter. We call system ( 2)the auxiliary autonomous system for (1).
Our classiﬁcation of integrable non-abelian Painlev´ e sys tems ( 1) is based on the following
Assumption 1. The corresponding auxiliary system is supposed to be integrab le. This means
that:
1. System (2)has a Lax representation
Lt= [M,L] (3)
with a spectral parameter .
2. It has inﬁnitely many polynomial non-abelian inﬁnitesima l symmetries commuting with
each other. Each of these symmetries has a Lax representation o f the form (3)with the
same operator L(but with diﬀerent operator M).
3. All systems of this hierarchy have the same set of ﬁrst integ rals deﬁned by trace(Li).
4. The Lax operators, ﬁrst integrals, and symmetries coincide w ith the corresponding com-
ponents of the scalar hierarchy when the size mof matrices is equal to one.
It turns out that known examples of non-abelian Painlev´ e sy stems satisfy some of these
conditions (for P1andP2see [8]). The hierarchy of Assumption 1can be obtained from the
trivial hierarchy of the scalar auxiliary system by the non- abelianization procedure [ 16,7]
described in Section 2.
Using the simplest example of Painlev´ e-2 systems, we show i n Subsection 2.1how the in-
gredients of a non-abelian hierarchy can be constructed. It turns out that non-abelianization
of only two simplest ﬁrst integrals and one inﬁnitesimal sym metry allows one to obtain a
ﬁnite list of non-abelian P2systems. These systems coincide with ones from the paper [ 3],
where a diﬀerent criterion of integrability for matrix Pain lev´ e-2 equations has been used.
In Section 3, using the same approach, we ﬁnd a complete list of Painlev´ e -6 type au-
tonomous systems. Due to the complexity of the calculations , we ﬁrst classify homogeneous
systems, which are the leading parts of autonomous systems o f theP6type. For each leading
part, ﬁnding the remaining coeﬃcients is not too diﬃcult. Th e resulting list contains 35
diﬀerent systems, including 19 systems from [ 5,6].
One of the reasons for the appearance of a large number of non- abelian systems of the
same type is the presence of transformations that preserve i ntegrability of systems ( 2) or (1).
The simplest example of such a transformation is the matrix t ransposition
τ(u) =uT, τ (v) =vT.
In Appendix A.1, we present an explicit form of only 8 new systems non-equiva lent with
respect to τ. For the old 19 systems we use the notation and lists from our p revious papers
[5,6].
To reconstruct the Painlev´ e system of the form ( 1) corresponding to an autonomous
P6system ( 2) described in Section 3, we have to replace the time twithzand choose
f(z) =z(z−1)in (1).
2A group of point transformations (see Subsection 5.1.1) isomorphic to S3×Z2acts on
the set of all non-autonomous systems of the Painlev´ e-6 typ e. The Hamiltonian systems [ 5]
form one orbit of this action, while the systems with the gene ralized Okamoto integral [ 6]
and systems listed in Appendix A.1have three and four orbits, respectively. Thus, there are
8 non-equivalent systems of the Painlev´ e-6 type.
Following Assumption 1, in Section 4, we ﬁnd all autonomous non-abelian Painlev´ e sys-
tems ofP1−P5types. All known and several new systems are contained in our list. New
systems are presented in Appendices A.5–A.2. Non-autonomous Painlev´ e P1−P5systems
are restored using autonomous systems found in Section 4.
Section 5is devoted to the study of non-autonomous Painlev´ e systems whose auxiliary
autonomous systems were constructed in Sections 3and4. In subsection 5.1, we describe
admissible transformations in each of the cases P1−P6. For non-abelian systems of P6type
we present in subsection 5.2.1an universal formula for isomonodromic Lax pairs of the form
Az−Bλ= [B,A], (4)
whereA(z,u,v,λ)andB(z,u,v,λ)are some 2×2matrices, rational in the spectral parameter
λand inz, linear in the parameters κi, and polynomial in u,v. It is suitable for a wide family
of systems whose autonomous systems satisfy the condition 3 of Assumption 1. Besides κi,the
family contains 9parameters. To specify these parameters we apply the non-ab elianization
procedure for symmetries of the autonomous system. Similar universal formulas for the Lax
representation were also found in Subsections 5.2.2–5.2.6forP5−P1type systems.
It turns out that non-abelian systems of the Painlev´ e-6 typ e generate non-abelian Painlev´ e
systems of the P1−P5type by the standard limiting procedure described in [ 6]. In Subsection
5.3we present limiting transition schemes for new P6systems obtained in this paper.
2 Non-abelianization of hierarchy
In the scalar Painlev´ e case, any auxiliary system ( 2) has a polynomial Hamiltonian Hand a
Lax representation ( 3). The hierarchy of commuting symmetries consists of the sys tems
/braceleftBigg
utk= (P1+zQ1)Hk,
vtk= (P2+zQ2)Hk,(5)
which have the Lax representations
Ltk= [HkM,L]. (6)
These symmetries are trivial: if we ﬁx a value of the integral Hthen the symmetries coincide
(up to a scaling of t) with the system ( 2).
We assume that all the above components of the hierarchy admi t the non-abelianization.
This means that
• we consider systems of the form ( 2) with matrix polynomials PiandQisuch that if the
sizemof matrices uandvis equal to one, the systems coincide with the corresponding
auxiliary autonomous system for a given scalar system of Pai nlev´ e type;
• there exist matrix polynomials Sisuch that if m= 1they coincide with Hiand traces
ofSiare ﬁrst integrals of the matrix system2;
2We do not assume that traceS1is its Hamiltonian.
3• the matrix system has a Lax representation ( 3) that coincides with the representation
for scalar system if m= 1;
• for any kthe matrix system has a (matrix) symmetry that coincides wit h (5) ifm= 1.
These symmetries commute with each other;
• any matrix symmetry possesses a Lax representation coinci ding with the scalar repre-
sentation ( 6) ifm= 1.
2.1 Painlev´ e-2 systems
Let us illustrate our approach by the simplest example of the Painlev´ e-2 systems. Starting
with trivial hierarchy of the scalar system, we show that the non-abelianization of several its
ingredients leads to a ﬁnite list of matrix Painlev´ e-2 syst ems. It was proved in [ 3] that all
these systems satisfy the Painlev´ e-Kovalevskaya test.
In the commutative case, the system has the form


du
dz=−u2+v−1
2z,
dv
dz= 2uv+κ,(7)
whereκis an arbitrary parameter. This system is Hamiltonian with t he Hamiltonian
H=−u2v+1
2v2−κu−1
2zv,
which is a ﬁrst integral for the auxiliary autonomous system


du
dt=−u2+v−1
2z,
dv
dt= 2uv+κ.(8)
It is clear that the systems


du
dtk= (−u2+v−1
2z)Hk,
dv
dtk= (2uv+κ)Hk(9)
are commuting inﬁnitesimal symmetries for ( 8).
It is easy to verify that Lax representation ( 3) with
L(λ) =/parenleftbigg
−4 0
0 4/parenrightbigg
λ2+/parenleftbigg
0 4u
4u0/parenrightbigg
λ+/parenleftbigg

λ−1,
M(λ) =/parenleftbigg
1 0
0−1/parenrightbigg
λ+/parenleftbigg
−βu−u
−u−βu/parenrightbigg (10)
is a Lax representation for system ( 8)3and therefore the operators LandMk=HkMdeﬁne
a Lax pair for system ( 9).
The hierarchy described above looks completely trivial: al l integrals are powers of only
one integral H, the symmetries and corresponding M-operators are proportional if we ﬁx a
value ofH. However, all these objects become non-trivial after the no n-abelianization [ 16,7].
3In the scalar case the parameter βin theM-operator is inessential.
4For the non-abelianization of system ( 8), we replace each monomial in the right-hand
side by a sum of non-commutative monomials such that under th e commutative reduction
the system coincides with ( 8). The result can be written in the form


du
dt=−u2+v−1
2z,
dv
dt=uv+vu+β[v,u]+κ,(11)
whereκ,β∈C.
2.1.1 Non-abelianization of integrals
Let us generalize to the non-abelian case several ﬁrst integ rals.
Proposition 1. For any βthe autonomous system (11)possesses ﬁrst integrals of the form
traceS1andtraceS2such that under the commutative reduction the non-commutat ive poly-
nomialsS1andS2coincide with HandH2, respectively.
Proof. The general ansatz4for the polynomial S1can be written as
S1=−u2v+1
2v2−κu−1
2zv.
One can verify that the condition
d
dttrace(Si) = 0 (12)
withi= 1holds.
Using the explicit formula
H2=u4v2−u2v3+1
4v4+2κu3v−κuv2+κ2u2+z/parenleftbig
u2v2−1
2v3+κuv/parenrightbig
+1
4z2v2,
we construct a general ansatz for the non-abelian polynomia lS2. Since the monomials
{vu3vu, vu2vu2, vu4v},{vuvuv, vu2v2},{vuvu, vu2v},{vuv}
deﬁne complete lists of homogeneous polynomials of degrees (4,2),(2,3),(2,2)and(1,2)in
uandvup to commutators, we take
S2=a1vu3vu+a2vu2vu2+(1−a1−a2)vu4v+a3vuvuv+(−1−a3)vu2v2+1
4v4
+2κvu3−κvuv+κu2+z/parenleftbig
a4vuvu+(1−a4)vu2v−1
2v3+κvu/parenrightbig
+1
4z2v2.
Condition ( 12) withi= 2leads to a system of linear algebraic equations for aj, j= 1,...,4,
whose coeﬃcients depend on β. Solving this system, we ﬁnd that for any β
a1= 0, a 2= 1, a 3= 0
anda4remains to be arbitrary. Therefore, the autonomous system h as the ﬁrst integral
traceS2, where
S2=vu2vu2−vu2v2+1
4v4+ 2κvu3−κvuv+κu2+z/parenleftbig
vu2v−1
2v3+κvu/parenrightbig
+a4z(vu2v−vuvu)+1
4z2v2.
In the case of the non-commutative Painlev´ e-2 system, the g eneral ansatz for the right-
hand side depends only on one parameter βand our ﬁrst test, based on the non-abelianization
of the ﬁrst integrals, does not determine β. For comparison, in the case of the Painlev´ e-6, it
reduces the number of unknown coeﬃcients from 18 to 9.
4Note that such polynomials are deﬁned up to commutators.
52.1.2 Non-abelianization of symmetries
In contrast to the above computation, the non-abelianizati on of the simplest symmetry ( 9)
withk= 1gives rise to a condition for β. The general ansatz for the non-abelian symmetry
has the form

,
whereai,bi,ci,di,e1,fi,gi,hi∈C. According to the item 3 of Assumption 1, the symmetry
should have the ﬁrst integrals traceS1andtraceS2found in Proposition 1. That leads to
the following linear relations between coeﬃcients of the sy mmetry
b1=−a1, b 2=−a1−a2, b 3= 0, b 4=−a1−a2−a3, b 5= 0,
b6= 0, b 7= 1−a2−a3−a4, b 8=−1+a1+a2, b 9=−1+a1+a2+a3,
c4=−1
2, c 5=−c2, d 1=−c1, d 2=1
2+c1−c2, d 3=−1
2−c1+c2−c3,
f2=−κ, h 1=−g1, h 2=−g2.
The remaining coeﬃcients of the symmetry can be easily expre ssed viaβfrom the compati-
bility conditions utτ−uτ t= 0andvtτ−vτ t= 0as follows
a1=1
24(β−2)(β2−1)β, a 2=−1
6(β2−4)(β−1)β, a 3=1
4(β2−4)(β2−1),
a4=−1
6(β2−4)β(β+1), c 1=−1
12(β−2)(β−1)(β+3), c 2=1
6(β2−4)β,
c3= 0, e 1=−1
2κ, f 1=κ(β−1), g 2=1
2(2−β−4g1).
Substituting these formulas into the compatibility condit ions, we arrive at
β(β2−1)(β2−4) = 0, β/parenleftBig
(β−2)(β−1)−12g1/parenrightBig
= 0.
Thus, we proved
Proposition 2. The symmetry (9)withk= 1admits a non-abelianization iﬀ
β= 0,±1,±2. (13)
Remark 1. The class of systems of the form (11)is invariant under the matrix transposition
τ(u) =uT, τ(v) =vT. Under this transposition the parameter βchanges as follows
τ(β) =−β.
Therefore, there exist three non-equivalent systems with β=−2,−1,0. The Hamiltonian
non-commutative system (see[12,5])corresponds to β= 0.
6The same set ( 13) of admissible values of the parameter βwas obtained in [ 3], where
matrix Painlev´ e-2 systems satisfying the Painlev´ e-Kova levskayatest were investigated. Notice
that in the approach related to the test it is crucial that uandvare matrices (of an arbitrary
size), while the above considerations can be generalized to the non-abelian case without any
changes.
2.1.3 Non-abelianization of Lax representations
The non-abelianization of the Lax representation ( 10) gives rise to the Lax pair
L(λ) =/parenleftbigg

for auxiliary autonomous system ( 11). It turns out that the non-abelian symmetry described
above has the Lax representation with the same L-operator and

The coeﬃcients of Ω3are expressed through βin Subsection 2.1.2. In the commutative case,
the operator M1coincides with HM. The relation [∂t−M,∂t1−M1] = 0 is equivalent to
condition ( 13).
3 The autonomous systems of Painlev´ e-6 type
In the Painlev´ e-6 case, we follow the line of the previous se ction. However, the computations
become extremely laborious. In particular, the ansatz for n on-abelian symmetry contains
about 1000 undetermined coeﬃcients.
The following trick turns out to be very helpful: we succeede d to ﬁnd the leading coeﬃ-
cients of the non-abelian system investigating separately the homogeneous system generated
by the leading parts.
In the scalar case, the auxiliary autonomous system has the f orm

H=H1+zH2,
7with
H1=u3v2−u2v2−κ1u2v+κ2uv−κ3u, H 2=−u2v2+uv2+κ4uv+(κ1−κ2−κ4)v.
The non-abelianization of ( 14) is a system of the form ( 2), where PiandQiare non-
commutative polynomials given by
P1(u,v) =a1u3v+a2u2vu+a3uvu2+(2−a1−a2−a3)vu3+c1u2v

whereai,bi,ci,di,fi,gi,h1, ande1belong to C.
It is clear that if system ( 2), (15) possesses integrals, symmetries and Lax representation,
then their leading parts deﬁne the corresponding objects fo r its leading homogeneous part.
For this reason, we ﬁrst perform a non-abelianization of the homogeneous part of the scalar
autonomous system of Painlev´ e-6 type.
3.1 Homogeneous non-abelian systems of Painlev´ e-6 type
The homogeneous principal part5,
/braceleftBigg
u′= 2u3v,
v′=−3u2v2,(16)
of (14) possesses the ﬁrst integral
I=u3v2.
For anyNthe following system/braceleftBigg
uτ=u′IN,
vτ=v′IN(17)
is an inﬁnitesimal symmetry of ( 16). In addition to ( 17), the system ( 16) has symmetries
/braceleftBigg
uτ=uIN,
vτ=−2vIN,(18)
which are related to the homogeneity of the system. The degre es of the simplest symmetries
are equal to 6 and 9. We are going to ﬁnd all non-abelianizatio ns of system ( 16) that have
non-abelian symmetries of degree 6 and 9.
The non-abelianization of ( 16) is given by


u′=a1u3v+a2u2vu+a3uvu2+(2−a1−a2−a3)vu3,
v′=b1u2v2+b2uvuv+b3uv2u+b4vu2v+b5vuvu
+(−3−b1−b2−b3−b4−b5)v2u2.(19)
5Here and below we denote t-derivatives by′.
8As in the Painlev´ e-2 case (see Subsection 2.1.1), we are going to generalize to the non-abelian
case several ﬁrst integrals. It allows us to reduce the numbe r of unknown coeﬃcients in ( 19).
Lemma 1. If the integrals IandI2admit a non-abelianization then the system (19)has the
form


u′=a1u3v+a2u2vu+a3uvu2+(2−a1−a2−a3)vu3,
v′=−a1u2v2+(−a1−a2)uvuv+(1−a2−a3)vu2v
+(−2+a1+a2)vuvu+(−2+a1+a2+a3)v2u2.(20)
Following the line of Subsection 2.1.2, we specify the remaining parameters in ( 20) by the
non-abelianization of symmetries.
Proposition 3. If system (20)admits a non-abelianization of symmetries of degrees 6 and
9 then it has one of the following forms (up to the transposition u→uT, v→vT)
Case 1: a1=a, a 2= 2−a, a 3= 0,
/braceleftBigg
u′=au3v+(2−a)u2vu,
v′=−au2v2−2uvuv+(−1+a)vu2v;
Case 2: a1= 0, a 2=a, a 3= 2−a,
/braceleftBigg
u′=au2vu+(2−a)uvu2,
v′=−auvuv−vu2v+(−2+a)vuvu,
witha=−1,0,1,2anda=−1,0,1,2,3, respectively.
Proof. In the proof, we ﬁrst ﬁnd relations between the coeﬃcients of system ( 20) which is
equivalent to the existence of a non-abelianization of the s ymmetry of degree 6.
The non-abelianization ansatz for symmetry ( 18) withN= 1is obvious, and we do not
present it here. Let us denote the unknown coeﬃcients of the m onomials u2vuvu,uvu2vu,
uvuvu2in the ansatz by c1,c2,c3, respectively. The compatibility symmetry condition
produces a large system of non-linear algebraic equations. Eliminating variables, we arrive
at an autonomous subsystem for the coeﬃcients a1,a2,a3,c1,c2,c3. One of its equations is
a1a3= 0which leads to two diﬀerent cases.
Ifa1= 0, then the subsystem is equivalent to
(a2+a3−2)c2= 0,(a2−2)a2−(a3−2)a3c2= 0, a3((a3−2)c2+a2) = 0,
(a3−2)a3(c2−1)c2= 0,(a3−1)c3= 0, c3(a2−c2) = 0,(c2−1)c2c3= 0.
This system has the following solution
a3= 2−a, a 2=a, c 2= 1, c 3= 0,
whereais an arbitrary parameter.
In the case a3= 0, we obtain the following system
(a1−a2)(a1+a2−2) = 0, a2(a1+a2−2) = 0,(a1−1)c1= 0,
(a2−1)c1= 0, a1c2= 0, c1c2= 0,(a2−2)c2= 0, c3= 0.
9The ﬁrst two equations give
a2= 2−a, a 1=a.
To specify an arbitrary parameter a, we use a non-abelian symmetry of degree 9. Let
us consider the compatibility condition and denote the unkn own coeﬃcients related to the
symmetry that cannot be determined uniquely from this condi tion byd1andd2. Then, in
Case1, these monomials are d1u3vu2vuv,d2u3vuvu2vand one can obtain a system that is
equivalent to
d1−(a−1)d2= 0,(d2−1)d2= 0, d 1(d2−1) = 0,
a2+a−4d1−2d2= 0,(d1−1)d1= 0,(a−2)d1= 0.
So, the solution is one of the following:
a=−1, d1= 0, d2= 0; a= 0, d1= 0, d2= 0;
a= 1, d1= 0, d2= 1; a= 2, d1= 1, d2= 1.
Similarly, in Case 2, a reduced system can be written as
(d2−1)d2= 0, d 1(d1+1) = 0, d 2(a−d1) = 0,
d1(a+4d2−3) = 0,(a−3)a+2(d1+(d1−1)d2+1) = 0,
whered1andd2are coeﬃcients of uvu2vu2vuanduvuvu2vu2, respectively. The system
possesses one of the following solutions:
a=−1, d1=−1, d2= 1; a= 0, d1= 0, d2= 1; a= 1, d1= 0, d2= 0;
a= 2, d1= 0, d2= 0; a= 3, d1=−1, d2= 0.
Therefore, we arrive at the statement of the proposition.
Remark 2. Note that Case 1,a= 0coincides with Case 2,a= 2.
Remark 3. The matrix transposition τ:u→uT, v→vTpreserves the class of systems (2),
(15)and maps integrable systems to integrable. In particular, syst ems related to Case 2from
Proposition 3witha= 0anda= 2as well as with a=−1anda= 3are dual with respect to
the transposition. Sometimes we formulate classiﬁcation st atements up to the transposition.
3.2 General case
Considering system ( 2), (15), we obtain the following generalization of Lemma 1:
Proposition 4. An autonomous system of the form (2),(15)admits a non-abelianization of
the integrals H6andH2
6iﬀ the polynomials PiandQihave the form
P1(u,v) =a1u3v+a2u2vu+a3uvu2+(2−a1−a2−a3)vu3
+c1u2v+(−2−c1−c2)uvu+c2vu2−κ1u2+κ2u,
Q1(u,v) =f1u2v+(−2−f1−f2)uvu+f2vu2
+h1uv+(2−h1)vu+κ4u+(κ1−κ2−κ4),(21)
10P2(u,v) =−a1u2v2+(−a1−a2)uvuv+(1−a2−a3)vu2v
+ (−2+a1+a2)vuvu+(−2+a1+a2+a3)v2u2
−c1uv2+(2+c1+c2)vuv−c2v2u
+e1uv+(2κ1−e1)vu−κ2v+κ3,
Q2(u,v) =−f1uv2+(2+f1+f2)vuv−f2v2u−v2−κ4v.(22)
As it was mentioned at the beginning of Section 3, if system ( 15) satisfy Assumption 1,
then its leading homogeneous part also satisﬁes it. Thus, Pr oposition 3separates the clas-
siﬁcation of systems ( 2), (21), (22) into 9 diﬀerent cases. We consider each of these cases
independently6.
An inhomogeneous scalar Painlev´ e-6 system does not have sy mmetry of order 6. There-
fore, we consider non-abelianization of the symmetry of ord er 9.
Just as in Subsection 2.1.2, we reﬁne the form of the symmetry, after which about 300
indeterminate coeﬃcients remain in the ansatz for the symme try. The compatibility condition
of the system and symmetry leads to a huge overdetermined sys tem of non-linear algebraic
equations with respect to the remaining nine coeﬃcients in t he equation and the symmetry
coeﬃcients. Despite its size, the system is easily solved us ing the computer algebra system
“Mathematica”.

4 Autonomous systems of P5−P1types

4.2 Systems of P4type
The scalar Hamiltonian for an autonomous P4system is given by

of the corresponding autonomous system is given by:

4.4 Systems of P2type
These systems were considered in Subsection 2.1in details. There are three systems non-
equivalent with respect to the transposition, which corres pond to results of the paper [ 3] (see
also [15]).
4.5P1type system
In the scalar case, an autonomous system has the form


du
dt=v,
dv
dt= 6u2+z.
For a non-abelianization of this system we can just replace t he variables uandvwith non-
commutative ones. It turns out that this analog admits Assum ption 1. Probably, the corre-
sponding matrix equation Painlev´ e-1 ﬁrst time appeared in the paper [ 4].
5 Non-abelian Painlev´ e systems
Formally, the restoring of a Painlev´ e system of the form ( 1) corresponding to any autonomous
system ( 2) described in Sections 3and4is very simple. We have to replace the time twith
zand choose f(z) =z(z−1)in theP6case,f(z) =zforP5andP3systems, and f(z) = 1
otherwise.
The question arises whether these systems are integrable. I t is not known whether all of
them satisfy the Painlev´ e property. However,
• all known matrix Painlev´ e systems can be obtained in this w ay;
• all these systems possess an isomonodromic Lax representa tion;
• systems of diﬀerent types are related by limiting transiti ons in the same way as in the
scalar case and can be obtained by degenerations of the P6systems.
135.1 Transformation groups and their orbits
5.1.1P6case
The scalar Painlev´ e-6 system admits the linear B¨ acklund t ransformations
r1: (z,u,v)/mapsto→(1−z,1−u,−v), r 2: (z,u,v)/mapsto→/parenleftbig
z−1, z−1u, zv/parenrightbig
,
which change the parameters as
r1: (κ1,κ2,κ3,κ4)/mapsto→(κ1,2κ1−κ2−κ4, κ3, κ4),
r2: (κ1,κ2,κ3,κ4)/mapsto→(κ1, κ4−1, κ3, κ2+1).
These involutions generate a group isomorphic to S3.
In the non-abelian case the transposition τtogether with the above transformations act
on the set of integrable non-abelian Painlev´ e-6 systems. T he transposition τchanges the
parameters in ( 21), (22) as follows:
τ(a1, a2, a3, c1, c2, e1, f1, f2, h1)
= (2−a1−a2−a3, a3, a2, c2, c1,2κ1−e1, f2, f1,2−h1).
Systems 1P6–8P6of theP6type (see Appendix A.1) are non-equivalent with respect to τ.
TheS3-action on these systems is given by:
r1(1P6)=1P6, r 2(1P6)=1P6, r 1(2P6)=4P6, r 2(2P6)=2P6,
r1(3P6)=3P6, r 2(3P6)=4P6, r 1(4P6)=2P6, r 2(4P6)=3P6,
r1(5P6)=5P6, r 2(5P6)=5P6, r 1(6P6)=8P6, r 2(6P6)=7P6,
r1(7P6)=7P6, r 2(7P6)=6P6, r 1(8P6)=6P6, r 2(8P6)=8P6.
Transformations r1,r2taking together with the transposition τgenerate a group isomorphic
toS3×Z2. The action of this group has the following four orbits:
Orbit 1 ={1P6, τ(1P6)},Orbit 2 ={2P6, τ(2P6),3P6, τ(3P6),4P6, τ(4P6)},
Orbit 3 ={5P6, τ(5P6)},Orbit 4 ={6P6, τ(6P6),7P6, τ(7P6),8P6, τ(8P6)}.
Besides four non-equivalent new systems corresponding to t he orbits, we have ﬁve non-
equivalent systems with the generalized Okamoto integral f ound in [ 6] and one Hamiltonian
non-abelian system [ 12,5].
5.1.2P5case
The transposition τacts on the parameters of system ( 24) as
τ(a1, a2, a3, c1, c2, e1, f1) = (2−a1−a2−a3, a3, a2, c2, c1,2−e1,2κ1−f1).
Its action on the systems from Appendix A.2forms four orbits:
Orbit 1 ={1P5, τ(1P5)}, Orbit 2 ={2P5, τ(2P5)},
Orbit 3 ={3P5, τ(3P5)}, Orbit 4 ={4P5, τ(4P5)}.
Thus we have 5 non-equivalent systems obtained in [ 6], one Hamiltonian system [ 12,5] and
4 new systems found in this paper.
145.1.3P4case
The transposition τand the involutions
s1(u, v, z) = (iv, iu,−iz), s 2(u, v, z) = (−iu, i(v−u−2z),−iz)
preserve a class of systems of the form ( 26), changing the parameters as
τ(α, β) = (−2−α,−2−β), s1(α, β) = (β, α), s2(α, β) = (α,−α−β−3).
There are three systems non-equivalent with respect to the g roup generated by τ,s1, ands2.
One of them, Hamiltonian, was found in [ 12], the second has the Okamoto integral [ 6], and
the third one is presented in Appendix A.3. All of them also arose in the paper [ 7], where
the Painlev´ e-Kovalevskaya test was used for classiﬁcatio n (see also [ 1]).
5.1.4P3case
The transposition τacts on the parameters of system ( 28) in the following way
τ(a1, a2, c1) = (a2, a1,−c1−2κ2).
Appendix A.4contains two systems non-equivalent with respect to τ. Four systems with the
Okamoto integral can be found in [ 5]. For one more, Hamiltonian system, see [ 12,5].
5.1.5P2case
There are three systems non-equivalent with respect to the t ransposition, which correspond
to results of the paper [ 3] (see also [ 15]).
5.1.6P1case.
There is only one matrix P1system (see section 4.5). Being Hamiltonian, it is invariant with
respect to the transposition τ.
5.2 Isomonodromic representations
All scalar Painlev´ e systems admit an isomonodromic repres entation [ 9,10] of the form ( 4).
Note that for commuting variables uandvthe relation ( 4) admits shifts of the form
B/mapsto→B+q(z,u,v)I, (29)
whereqis an arbitrary polynomial in uandv, while in the non-commutative case such
transformations are not allowed.
Using the non-abelianization procedure proposed in [ 7], we generalize well-known isomon-
odromic pairs for the scalar P6−P1systems to the non-abelian case. As a result, we obtain
Lax pairs not only for speciﬁc Painlev´ e-type systems with a uxiliary autonomous systems
listed in Sections 3and4, but for whole classes of systems satisfying the property 3 i n
Assumption 1(see Proposition 4and item a) in Propositions 5–7).
The non-abelianization procedure is based on the observati on that most of Lax pairs for
scalar Painlev´ e type systems are homogeneous in the follow ing sense. If we represent Aand
Bas rational functions in λ,z, andκiwith coeﬃcients being 2×2matrices polynomial in u
andv, then these coeﬃcients turn out to be homogeneous for proper weights of uandv(see
the next section for details).
155.2.1 Systems of P6type
The Lax representation ( 4) for the commutative P6system ( 14) found in [ 10] is deﬁned by
A(z,λ) =A0(z)
λ+A1(z)
λ−1+A2(z)
λ−z, B(z,λ) =B0(z)−A2(z)
λ−z, (30)
where the matrices A0(z),A1(z),A2(z), andB0(z)are equivalent to
A0=/parenleftbigg−1−κ1+κ4uz−1−1
0 0/parenrightbigg
, A 1=/parenleftbigg−uv+κ1 1
−u2v2+κ1uv+κ3uv/parenrightbigg
,
A2=/parenleftbigguv+(κ1−κ2−κ4)−uz−1

,
B0=/parenleftBigg

2u2v−κ1u−z(2uv+(κ1−κ2−κ4))/parenrightbig
0
−uv2−(κ1−κ2−κ4)v 0/parenrightBigg
.
If we assign the weights w(u) =w(v) = 1 to the variables, then any matrix coeﬃcient
Q(u,v)has homogeneous entries qijsuch that w(q11) =w(q22) =w(q12)+2 =w(q21)−2.
Under the non-abelianization we preserve the same structur e ofAandBinλ,z, andκi
and the homogeneity property. Besides, we require the in the scalar limit the pair coincides
with the described above up to a transformation of the form ( 29).
Proposition 8. Any non-abelian system of the P6type described in Proposition 4, is equiv-
alent to the zero-curvature condition (4)with matrices A(z,λ)andB(z,λ)of the form (30),
where
A0=/parenleftbigg−1−κ1+κ4uz−1−1

+e1u+z(−f1uv+(2+f2)vu−h1v).
In the scalar case the polynomial qcan be removed by shift ( 29).
5.2.2 Systems of P5type
The Painlev´ e-5 system associated with the Hamiltonian ( 23) admits an isomonodromic Lax
pair of the form
A(λ,z) =A0(z)+A1(z)
λ+A2(z)
λ−1, B(λ,z) =B1λ+B0(z), (31)
where [ 10]
A0=/parenleftbiggκ4z0
0 0/parenrightbigg
, A1=/parenleftbigg−uv+κ1 1

, B0=z−1/parenleftbigg2u2v−2uv−κ1u+κ1−u+1
−u2v2+uv2+κ1uv−κ2v+κ30/parenrightbigg
.
This Lax pair can be generalized to the non-abelian case as fo llows
Proposition 9. Let a non-abelian system of the P5type possesses an auxiliary autonomous
system described in the item a)of Proposition 5. Then it has an isomonodromic Lax pair of
the form (31)with matrices
A0=/parenleftbiggκ4z0

zq(z,u,v) =−a1u2v−(a1+a2)uvu+(1−a1−a2−a3)vu2−c1uv+(3+c2)vu
+f1u−e1v.
5.2.3 Systems of P4type
The Hamiltonian ( 25) leads to the Painlev´ e-4 system. Its well-known [ 10] that this system
is equivalent to the zero-curvature condition ( 4) with
A(λ,z) =A1λ+A0(z)+A−1(z)λ−1, B(λ,z) =B1λ+B0(z), (32)
where the matrices A1,A0(z),A−1(z),B1, andB0(z)are given by
A1=/parenleftbigg−2 0

,
B1=/parenleftbigg−2 0
0 0/parenrightbigg
, B 0=/parenleftbigg−u−2z1

.
According to the item a) from Proposition 6, non-abelian systems of the P4type associated
with ( 26) admit the non-abelianization of the ﬁrst integrals. One ca n verify that they also
have an isomonodromic representation.
Proposition 10. For anyα,β∈C, a non-abelian P4type system deﬁned by the autonomous
system (26)has a Lax pair of the form (32), where

175.2.4P3type systems
The scalar P′
3system related to Hamiltonian ( 27) has (see [ 10]) the following isomonodromic
Lax pair
A(λ,z) =A0(z)+A−1(z)λ−1+A−2(z)λ−2, B(λ,z) =B1λ+B0(z),(33)
where the matrices A0(z),A−1(z),A−2(z),B1, andB0(z)are equivalent to

Proposition 11. Suppose that a non-abelian system of the P′
3type has an auxiliary au-
tonomous system given by the item a)of Proposition 7. Then it is equivalent to (4), where a

5.2.5 Systems of P2type
The commutative Painlev´ e-2 system ( 7) possesses an isomonodromic Lax pair of the form [ 10]
A(λ,z) =A2λ2+A1(z)λ+A0(z), B(λ,z) =B1λ+B0(z), (34)
where the matrices A2,A1(z),A0(z),B1, andB0(z)are equivalent to the following:

Proposition 12. Any non-abelian system of the P2corresponding to autonomous system
(11), is equivalent to the zero-curvature condition (4)with matrices A(z,λ)andB(z,λ)of

18Remark 4. Here and in Subsection 2.1, we considered the Lax pairs of Jimbo-Miwa [10]
and the Flaschka-Newell types for the Painlev´ e-2 equation . It was shown in [17,11]that in
the scalar case these Lax pairs are related to each other by a ge neralized Laplace transform
supplemented with a gauge transformation. Formally, assumin g the cancellation of terms
that arise from the integration by parts, it is easy to verify tha t this correspondence can be
generalized to the non-abelian case.
5.2.6P1type system

5.3 Tree of degenerations
In [6] limiting transitions for non-abelian Painlev´ e-type sys tems having Okamoto integrals
were found. The same formulas with minor changes in constant s can be applied for systems
from the current paper7.
The degeneration trees for P6systems 1P6–8P6from Appendix A.1non-equivalent with
respect to the transposition τare shown schematically in Figures 1,2, and 3.

The bold font in iPkdenotes the Painlev´ e systems from Appendices A.1–A.5, the thin
font is used for systems with Okamoto integrals, and the Hami ltonian systems are denoted
as PH
k.
In order to get degeneracies for the systems, obtained by the transposition from the sys-
tems from Appendix A.1, we need to replace each system in Figures 1–3with its transposed
version.
We see that the trees corresponding to P6systems from diﬀerent orbits (see Subsection
5.1.1) have no intersections. All 18 systems listed in the appendi ces are presented in Figures
1–3. No additional new systems were obtained by degenerations, so the class of systems
found in this paper is closed with respect to the limiting tra nsitions.
These limiting transitions can be also extended to the Lax pa irs. In most cases, formulas
from Subsection 4.1 in [ 6] are applicable, but in the cases P5→P′
3andP4→P2it is
necessary to supplement them with a gauge transformation
˜A(z,λ) =gA(z,λ)g−1+∂λg g−1, ˜B(z,λ) =gB(z,λ)g−1+∂zg g−1,
whereg=zµIandg=zµε−6I, respectively. The constant µdepends on the choice of a
particular system of P5orP4type.
6 Conclusion
We found all non-abelian Painlev´ e systems whose auxiliary autonomous systems have ﬁrst
integrals and symmetries. We believe that these systems enj oy the Painlev´ e property. It was
shown in [ 4,3,7] that in the P1,P2, andP4cases they satisfy the Painlev´ e-Kovalevskaya test.
We constructed isomonodromic Lax pairs for multiparametri c families of P2–P6systems
containing all the systems obtained in this paper. As long as we assume that the coeﬃcients
of non-abelian polynomials are scalar constants, all syste ms areGL(m)invariant and we may
consider their restriction on the invariants of GL(m)-action. It turns out that all restricted
systems of the above families coincide with each other.
A comparison of the results from [ 7] and Subsection 5.2.3shows that in order to choose
from these families those systems that have the Painlev´ e pr operty, one can assume the exis-
tence of symmetries for the auxiliary autonomous systems.
The situation changes drastically if the constant coeﬃcien ts themselves are non-abelian.
Examples of such Painlev´ e systems were found in [ 4,15,2,7,5]. We hope that a systematic
construction of such systems can be carried out by simultane ous non-abelianization of the
coeﬃcients of the autonomous systems found in this paper and their symmetries.
We are going to devote a separate paper to the search for syste ms of the Painlev´ e type
with non-abelian coeﬃcients and the study of the properties of the corresponding autonomous
systems.

B.1 Non-abelian systems of P′
3(D7)type
For the same reasons as in the papers [ 6] and [ 5], here we consider a special case P′
3(D7)of
the Painlev´ e- 3′system. The corresponding scalar autonomous system is Hami ltonian with
H=u2v2+κ2u2v+κ1uv+κ3u+κ4zu−1. (35)
A non-abelian generalization of the autonomous system read s as

whereai,bi,c1,κi∈C.
Proposition 13.
a)A system of the form (36)admits a non-abelianization of integrals HandH2iﬀ
b1=−a1, b 2=−a2.
b)If the system additionally possesses a non-abelianization o f the symmetry (5)of degree
7, then it belongs to one of the following lists:
i)Appendix A.7 from [5],
23ii)Appendix C.1 from [6],
iii) (up to the transposition τ)
/braceleftBigg
u′= 2u2v+κ1u+κ2u2,

u′= 2u2v+κ1u+κ2u2,
v′=−2uv2−κ1v−κ2uv−κ2vu−κ3+κ4zu−2.2P′
3(D7)
The transposition τacts on the parameters of system ( 36) as follows
τ(a1, a2, c1) = (a2, a1,−c1−2κ2).
Systems from the list iii) are non-equivalent with respect t oτ. There non-equivalent systems
with Okamoto integral were obtained in [ 6]. One Hamiltonian system can be found in [ 5].
TheP′
3(D7)system related to Hamiltonian ( 35) has an isomonodromic Lax pair [ 10] of
the form ( 33). Matrices A0(z),A−1(z),A−2(z),B1, andB0(z)are equivalent to
A0=/parenleftbigg0 0
κ4zu−10/parenrightbigg
, A−1=−/parenleftbigguv+κ1u
κ2uv+κ3−uv/parenrightbigg
, A−2=/parenleftbigg−κ21
0 0/parenrightbigg
,
B1=/parenleftbigg0 0
κ4z0/parenrightbigg
, B 0=z−1/parenleftbiggκ2u−u
0 0/parenrightbigg
.
One can generalize this pair to the non-commutative case for non-abelian Painlev´ e- 3′(D7)
systems satisfying the item 3 from Assumption 1as follows.
Proposition 14. Suppose that a non-abelian system of the P′
3(D7)type admits an auxiliary
autonomous system deﬁned by the item a)from Proposition 13. Then it is equivalent to (4),
where the Lax pair has the form (33)with
A0=/parenleftbigg0 0
κ4zu−10/parenrightbigg
, A−1=−/parenleftbigguv+κ1u
κ2vu+κ3−vu/parenrightbigg
