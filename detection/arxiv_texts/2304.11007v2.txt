Abstract. The celebrated Ohsawa–Takegoshi extension theorem for L2holomorphic
functions on bounded pseudoconvex domains in Cnis a fundamental result in several
complex variables and complex geometry. Ohsawa conjectured in 19 95 that the same
theorem still holds for more general bounded complete K¨ ahler dom ains inCn. Recently,
Chen–Wu–Wang conﬁrmed this conjecture in a special case. In this paper we extend their
result to the case of holomorphic sections of twisted canonical bun dles over relatively
compact complete K¨ ahler domains in Stein manifolds. As an application we prove a Har-
togs type extension theorem for plurisubharmonic functions acro ss a compact complete
pluripolar set, which is complementary to a classical result of Shiﬀman and can be seen
as an analogue of the Skoda–El Mir extension theorem for plurisubh armonic functions—a
result that has been vacant since at least 1985.
1.Introduction
One of the most fundamental results in several complex variables is the so-called Ohsawa–
TakegoshiL2extension theorem, which, in a less general form, can be stated as follows:
Theorem A (see [ OT87 ]).LetΩbe a bounded pseudoconvex domain in CnandHbe a
complex linear subspace of Cnintersecting Ω. Then for every plurisubharmonic function ϕ
onΩand every holomorphic function fonΩ∩Hsuch that/integraldisplay
Ω∩H|f|2e−ϕdVH<∞,
there exists a holomorphic function FonΩsuch thatF|Ω∩H=fand
/integraldisplay
Ω|F|2e−ϕdV≤C/integraldisplay
Ω∩H|f|2e−ϕdVH,
whereC > 0is a constant depending only on the diameter of Ωand the codimension of H
inCn, anddV(resp.dVH)denotes the Lebesgue measure on Cn(resp.H).
Since the seminal work of Ohsawa–Takegoshi [ OT87 ], there has been a great deal of
work in the literature on the above theorem and its various generaliz ations and variants
in diﬀerent contexts, as well as applications. The Ohsawa–Takegos hiL2extension theo-
rem has proved to be an indispensable and very eﬀective tool for so lving many important
problems in several complex variables, complex analytic and algebraic geometry. We refer

the reader to [ Ber10 ,B/suppress lo14 ,Dem12b ,MV15 ,Ohs18 ,Ohs20 ,Pau10 ,Siu02 ] for a com-
prehensive overview of the subject, and to [ B/suppress lo13 ,GZ15a ,GZ15b ] for signiﬁcant recent
developments. In particular, Guan–Zhou [ GZ15a ] established an optimal constant ver-
sion of the Ohsawa–Takegoshi L2extension theorem in a very general setting, with many
impressive applications. After this, there is also a considerable amou nt of work closely re-
lated to the Ohsawa–Takegoshi L2extension theorem; see [ BL16 ,CPB24 ,CC22 ,DWZZ24 ,
DNWZ23 ,Hos20 ,Kim23 ,LXZ23 ,LX24 ,RZ21 ,ZZ18 ,ZZ20 ] and others.
Despite the above achievements, a number of questions about the L2extension of holo-
morphic functions remain to be answered, including the following long- standing one posed
by Ohsawa himself:
Question B (see [ Ohs95 ]).1Does Theorem Astill hold for more general bounded complete
K¨ ahler domains in Cn?
For the background and motivation for asking this question, we ref er the reader to
Ohsawa’s original paper [ Ohs95 ] (and his recent book [ Ohs18 ]). We only remark here that,
as has been amply demonstrated by the work of Demailly [ Dem82 ], H¨ ormander’s weighted
L2theory for the ¯∂-operator on Stein manifolds works equally well on more general com plete
K¨ ahler manifolds, and thus it is reasonable to expect that the L2extension theory of
Ohsawa–Takegoshi, which builds on the former, does as well. At pres ent, it seems diﬃcult
to answer Question Bin full generality; to the best of our knowledge, the only known resu lt
so far is the one recently obtained by Chen–Wu–Wang [ CWW15 ], who gave an aﬃrmative
answer in the special case where His 0-dimensional, i.e., His a single point. This result
has found a few unexpected applications; see [ CWW15 ] for details.
In this paper we ﬁrst extend the above result of Chen–Wu–Wang to the case of holo-
morphic sections of twisted canonical bundles over relatively compa ct complete K¨ ahler
domains in Stein manifolds, and then present some new applications. O ur ﬁrst main result
reads as follows.
Theorem 1.1. LetXbe ann-dimensional Stein manifold with a continuous volume form
dVXandΩbe a relatively compact complete K¨ ahler domain in X. SupposeLis a holo-
morphic line bundle over Ωandhis a singular Hermitian metric on Lwith semi-positive
curvature current. Then for every x0∈Ωandsx0∈ΛnT∗
x0Ω⊗Lx0, there is an L-valued
holomorphic n-formsonΩsuch thats(x0) =sx0and

provided the right-hand side is ﬁnite, where C > 0is a constant depending only on n,Ω
anddVX.
Here{,}hdenotes the sesquilinear product combining the wedge product of s calar
valued forms with the Hermitian metric honL(see Section 4below for a precise deﬁnition).
We now sketch the idea of the proof of Theorem 1.1. Following the strategy of Ohsawa
[Ohs95 ] and Chen–Wu–Wang [ CWW15 ], we reduce Theorem 1.1to an Ohsawa–Takegoshi
typeL2existence theorem for the ¯∂-operator on Hermitian holomorphic line bundles, sub-
ject to certain curvature constraints, over complete K¨ ahler manifolds (see Theorem 3.2
below). Since the Hermitian metric on the line bundle under considerat ion is allowed
to besingular , the proof of Theorem 3.2relies heavily on Demailly’s approximation the-
ory [Dem82 ,Dem92 ,Dem94 ], in which there are mainly two approximation theorems for
singular Hermitian metrics:
1Although formulated slightly diﬀerently, this question is actually equiv alent to Ohsawa’s original ques-
tion, as can be easily seen by induction on n.L2EXTENSION AND REMOVABLE SINGULARITIES OF PSH FUNCTIONS 3
•one is a local approximation by Hermitian metrics that are smooth on t he complement
of suitably chosen complex subvarieties in the manifold, with arbitrar ily small loss of
positivity in curvature;
•the other is a global approximation by Hermitian metrics that are smo oth on the
entire manifold, but with less controllable loss of positivity in curvatur e.
The ﬁrst approximation theorem has been used by Zhou–Zhu [ ZZ18 ] (see also [ ZZ20 ])
to establish a singular metric (and optimal constant) version of the Ohsawa–Takegoshi–
ManivelL2extension theorem on weakly pseudoconvex K¨ ahler manifolds [ Dem00 ]. In
the more general case of complete K¨ ahler manifolds, the lack of ps eudoconvexity however
makes it hard to apply the ﬁrst approximation theorem. Instead we make use of the second
one, which combined with the a priori inequality for the twisted ¯∂-operator due to Ohsawa–
Takegoshi [ OT87 ] allows us to solve the ¯∂-equation with two error terms by an induction
argument, thus proving Theorem 3.2. This idea of arguing by induction is inspired by the
work of Demailly [ Dem82 ].
Next, we present an interesting application of Theorem 1.1to the removable singularities
of plurisubharmonic (psh for short) functions. Speciﬁcally, we pro ve the following
Theorem 1.2. LetΩbe a domain in a Stein manifold of dimension ≥2andKbe a
compact complete pluripolar subset of Ω. Then every psh function on Ω\Kadmits a unique
psh extension to Ω.
Recently, Chen [ Che17 ] showed that the well-known Hartogs extension theorem for holo-
morphic functions is also valid for pluriharmonic functions (see also [ Wan22a ]). However,
it has long been known that this is not the case for psh functions (se e, e.g., [ BT88 ]). Given
this situation, it is worth proving a Hartogs extension theorem of a s lightly diﬀerent type
for psh functions, such as Theorem 1.2. Our motivation for such a result also stems from a
renewed interest in the original Hartogs extension theorem in rece nt years; for details see
the most recent work [ BDP22 ,Vij22 ] and the references therein.
To put Theorem 1.2in historical context, we recall that there are two landmark result s
in the extension theory of closed positive currents, namely the Har vey extension theorem
[Har74 ] and the Skoda–El Mir extension theorem [ Sko82 ,ElM84 ], which are complemen-
tary to each other and either of which uniﬁes and generalizes many im portant results
previously proved by Bishop, Remmert–Stein, Shiﬀman, Siu and othe rs; for more informa-
tion see the original papers just mentioned and also [ HP75 ,Har77 ,Sib85 ]. Corresponding
to Harvey’s extension theorem there is an extension theorem for p sh functions due to Shiﬀ-
man [ Shi72 ], which states that every psh function on an n-dimensional complex manifold
extends plurisubharmonically across a closed set of Hausdorﬀ (2 n−2)-measure zero. The-
orem 1.2can be seen more or less as an analogue of the Skoda-El Mir extensio n theorem
for psh functions, which seems to have been missing until this paper , at least as far as we
have found.
To say more about Theorem 1.2, we also recall a standard fact in pluripotential theory
that pluripolar sets in an n-dimensional complex manifold have Hausdorﬀ dimension at
most 2n−2, and mention the existence of compact complete pluripolar sets wit h positive
(ﬁnite or inﬁnite) Hausdorﬀ (2 n−2)-measure in Cn; see Subsection 2.1for precise refer-
ences. These two facts show that Theorem 1.2is complementary to Shiﬀman’s theorem as
described above, meaning that either of the two theorems can be a pplied to certain cases
where the other cannot. Furthermore, we point out that Theore m1.2is global in nature,
whereas Shiﬀman’s theorem (as well as many other related results in the literature; see
[Siu74 ,HP75 ,CWW15 ], etc.) is local in nature.4 XIEPING WANG
Interestingly, the proof of Theorem 1.2involves a combination of theL2theory for the ¯∂-
operator (more speciﬁcally, Theorem 1.1), pluripotential theory, and some basic geometric
measure theory; see Sect. 5for details. In contrast, in most of the previous work on the
extension of closed positive currents (particularly, complex variet ies) and psh functions, the
L2method and the geometric measure-theoretic method have often been used separately ,
notably by Siu [ Siu74 ] and Shiﬀman [ Shi68 ], Harvey [ Har74 ], respectively. The use of
Theorem 1.1in the proof of Theorem 1.2is inspired by the work of Chen–Wu–Wang
[CWW15 ] and Demailly [ Dem92 ]. It should also be mentioned that a weaker version of
Theorem 1.2, with some additional assumptions, was already proved by the auth or in his
previous work [ Wan22b ] by quite a diﬀerent method.
We now pose the following fairly natural question concerning Theore m1.2:
Question 1.3. Does Theorem 1.2still hold when Kis only assumed to be a compact
pluripolar subset of Ω?
The answer to this question is likely to be positive, although it remains o ut of reach at
the time of writing. We also refer the interested reader to [ CWW15 , Conjecture 4.1] for a
diﬀerent but closely related problem.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2we review some necessary notions and
results that will be used in this paper. We then prove in Section 3an Ohsawa–Takegoshi
typeL2existence theorem for the ¯∂-operator on complete K¨ ahler manifolds, which is in
turn used in Section 4to prove Theorem 1.1. Finally, the proof of Theorem 1.2is carried
out in Section 5.

2.Preliminaries
In this section we ﬁx some necessary notation and collect some fund amental results from
pluripotential theory and the L2theory of the ¯∂-operator, which will be used in subsequent
sections.
2.1.Complete pluripolar sets and their deﬁning functions. We begin by recalling
the deﬁnition of complete pluripolar sets. Let Xbe a complex manifold and Psh( X) denote
the set of all psh functions on X.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A setE⊂Xis called complete pluripolar if for every point x∈Ethere
exists a neighborhood Uofxand a function ϕ∈Psh(U) such that
E∩U=ϕ−1(−∞).
The set of all complex subvarieties of Xforms a particularly important class of (closed)
complete pluripolar sets, but complete pluripolar sets are much more general: for instance,
the Cartesian product of ﬁnitely many (possibly distinct) Cantor ty pe sets of logarithmic
capacity zero in the complex plane is a compact complete pluripolar set in the corresponding
complex Euclidean space (see, e.g., [ Ran95 ]), but obviously not complex-analytic. One
may also consult [ ElM84 ,LMP92 ,Edl04 ,DM14 ] and the references therein for many other
nontrivial, constructive examples of compact complete pluripolar sets in Cn, especially
those of minimal Hausdorﬀ codimension (i.e., of Hausdorﬀ codimension two). Using theseL2EXTENSION AND REMOVABLE SINGULARITIES OF PSH FUNCTIONS 5
examples and the Bishop–Narasimhan–Remmert embedding theorem , one can construct a
large number of compact complete pluripolar sets in general Stein ma nifolds.
On Stein manifolds, Colt ¸oiu [ Col90 ] proved the following important result concerning
the existence of a global deﬁning function for a closed complete plur ipolar set.
Theorem 2.2 (see [ Col90 ]).LetXbe a Stein manifold and E⊂Xbe a closed complete
pluripolar set. Then there is a function ρ∈Psh(X)∩C∞(X\E)such thatρ−1(−∞) =E
and√−1∂¯∂ρ> 0onX\E.
As we shall see later, this result is crucial in the proof of Theorem 1.2.
2.2.Twisted Bochner-Kodaira-Nakano inequality. Let (X,ω) be ann-dimensional
K¨ ahler manifold and ( L,h) be a Hermitian holomorphic line bundle over X. Given integers
0≤p,q≤n, we letL2(X,Λp,qT∗X⊗L;ω,h) denote the space of L-valued (p,q)-formsu
with measurable complex coeﬃcients on X, satisfying
/bardblu/bardblω,h:=/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay
X|u|2
ω,hdVω/parenrightbigg1/2
<∞,
where| |2
ω,his the pointwise norm on Λp,qT∗X⊗Linduced by ωandh, anddVω=ωn/n!
is the volume form on Xinduced by ω. We also denote by /a\}bracketle{t,/a\}bracketri}htω,h(resp./a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{t,/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htω,h) the
pointwise (resp. global) inner product corresponding to | |2
ω,h(resp./bardbl /bardbl2
ω,h). Obviously
/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{t,/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htω,hmakesL2(X,Λp,qT∗X⊗L;ω,h) a Hilbert space, which contains as a dense sub-
space the space D(X,Λp,qT∗X⊗L) ofL-valuedC∞(p,q)-forms with compact support in
X. For our later purposes, we also need to consider the maximal weak extension of the
¯∂-operator to L2(X,Λp,qT∗X⊗L;ω,h), which we still denote by ¯∂. Then it is a closed,
densely deﬁned operator, and so is its Hilbert adjoint ¯∂∗
ω,hwith respect to /a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{t,/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htω,h.
Sometimes it is necessary to consider L-valued (p,q)-forms with local square-integrability
onX, instead of (global) square-integrability. The space consisting of a ll such forms is
obviously independent of the choice of the C∞metricsωandh, and we simply denote it
byL2
loc(X,Λp,qT∗X⊗L).
We now record the following a priori inequality due to Ohsawa–Takego shi [OT87 ] (see
also [ Ohs95 ,Dem00 ,Dem12b ]), which plays a fundamental role in the whole L2theory of
the¯∂-operator.
Lemma 2.3. Let(X,ω)be ann-dimensional K¨ ahler manifold and (L,h)be a Hermitian
holomorphic line bundle over X. Given two C∞functionsη,λ>0onX, we then have

Inequality ( 2.1) also applies to the case where ( L,h) is a Hermitian holomorphic vector
bundle over X. Since we only use the case of line bundles in this paper, we restrict ou rselves
to this particular case.
3.An Ohsawa–Takegoshi type L2existence theorem
In this section we present an Ohsawa–Takegoshi type L2existence theorem for the ¯∂-
operator on complete K¨ ahler manifolds, which contains as a special case Demailly’s far-
reaching generalization of the L2existence theorems due to H¨ ormander and Andreotti-
Vesentini (cf. [ Dem82 , Th´ eor` eme 5.1] and also Remark 3.3(iii)). Such an existence result6 XIEPING WANG
is more or less known to experts, but since being unable to locate a go od reference for its
proof, we will include a detailed argument for the reader’s convenien ce. (Here we are not
claiming any credit.)
To begin with, we recall the notion of singular Hermitian metrics. Let Lbe a holomorphic
line bundle over a complex manifold X.
Deﬁnition 3.1. A (possibly) singular Hermitian metric honLis a measurable Hermitian
metric that can be expressed on Uase−ϕU, whereU⊂Xis an open set over which Lis
trivial, and ϕU∈L1
loc(U).
It is easy to see that in terms of a given smooth Hermitian metric h0, every singular
Hermitian metric honLcan be written exactly in the form h=h0e−ϕ, whereϕ∈L1
loc(X);
and the curvature current
√
−1Θh(L):=−√

of (L,h) is semi-positive exactly when the weight ϕ=−log(h/h0) ofh(with respect to
h0) satisﬁes√
−1Θh0(L) +√
−1∂¯∂ϕ≥0 onX
in the sense of currents.
Given a singular Hermitian metric honL, we can also deﬁne L2(X,Λp,qT∗X⊗L;ω,h)
and/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{t,/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htω,hin a similar way as in Subsection 2.2. We now state and prove the following
Theorem 3.2. LetXbe ann-dimensional complete K¨ ahler manifold with a (not necessar-
ily complete )K¨ ahler metric ωandLbe a holomorphic line bundle over Xwith a singular
Hermitian metric h. Suppose there are bounded C∞functionsη,λ>0onXsuch that

−1Θh(L)−√

in the sense of currents, where Θis a continuous positive (1,1)-form onX. Then for every

We are of course mainly interested in the case q= 1 but the general statement is needed
in the proof.
Proof. First of all, a standard monotonicity argument as in [ Dem82 ] allows us to reduce
the theorem to the case when ωis complete, which we shall henceforward assume.
We next make use of Demailly’s approximation theorem [ Dem82 , Th´ eor` eme 9.1], accord-
ing to which there is an increasing sequence {hj}j∈NofC∞Hermitian metrics on Lsuch
that

where{δj}j∈Nis a decreasing sequence of continuous functions on Xthat converges

Since (X,ω) is complete, we can easily construct a C∞exhaustion function ρforXwith
|dρ|ω≤1 onX. Choose also a C∞cut-oﬀ function 0 ≤χ≤1 onRsatisfyingχ|(−∞,1)= 1,
χ|(2,∞)= 0 and |χ′| ≤2 onR. Deﬁne
χj:=χ(ρ/j), j∈N.
We now proceed to establish several necessary estimates. For no tational simplicity, we
set
L2(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L) =L2(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L;ω,h),
L2(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L)k=L2(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L;ω,hk)
and
/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{t,/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}ht=/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{t,/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htω,h,/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{t,/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htk=/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{t,/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htω,hk
as well as ¯∂∗

we may even omit subscripts when no confusion arises. Let j, k∈N. Givenvas in the

This completes the proof of the theorem for the case q=n.
Now assume that 1 ≤q≤n−1 and that the conclusion of the theorem is true for all
¯∂-closed (n,q+ 1)-forms with the prescribed integrability. We proceed to show th at the
conclusion is also true for all ( n,q)-forms with the same property. Let vbe such a form.
Then by the induction hypothesis, for every j∈Nthere exists vj∈L2(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L)
such that

Also for every w∈Dom ¯∂∗

Since
vj∈L2(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L)⊂L2(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L)k
andχjv−vj∈Ker¯∂, it then follows that
/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{tχjv−vj,w/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htk=/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{tχjv−vj,w1/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htk,
whence
/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{tχjv,w/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htk=/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{tvj,w/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htk+/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{tχjv−vj,w1/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htk=/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{tχjv,w1/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htk+/a\}bracketle{t/a\}bracketle{tvj,w2/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketri}htk.
Applying the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to this and taking ( 3.9) into account, we get

On the other hand, since w1∈Ker¯∂∩Dom ¯∂∗

the previous paragraph leads to the existence of a solution uto equation ¯∂u=vtogether

2u/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2≤/angbracketleftbig/angbracketleftbig

thus completing the induction procedure (and hence the proof of t he theorem).
To prove ( 3.11), observe ﬁrst that by ( 3.10),
(3.12) /bardblfjk/bardblk≤/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleχjδ1/2
kvjk/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
k≤sup
X(χjδ1/2

for allk∈N, where const jdenotes a constant depending only on j. This observation is
crucial in the following argument and will be used repeatedly. For the time being, combined
with the Banach–Alaoglu theorem, it implies that the set of weak limit po ints of{fjk}k∈N
is non-empty. Thus what we need to show is equivalent to saying that 0 is the only element
of the set. To establish the validity of the latter, we may assume with out loss of generality
that the sequence {fjk}k∈Nitself is weakly convergent in L2
loc(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L), with limit,
sayfj. LetHk(resp.H) denote the only positive deﬁnite Hermitian operator on ( L,h1)
that satisﬁes |Hkζ|1=|ζ|k(resp.|Hζ|1=|ζ|) for allζ∈L. Then
IdL≤Hk≤Hk+1
for allk∈N, and{Hk}k∈Nconverges to Halmost everywhere on X. Extending Hkand
Hto Λn,qT∗X⊗Lin a natural way, we claim that
Hkfjk→Hfjweakly in L2
loc(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L)
ask→ ∞ . To show this, it suﬃces to check that Hfjis the only weak limit point of
{Hkfjk}k∈N. Again by ( 3.12) and the Banach–Alaoglu theorem, we may assume that the
sequence {Hkfjk}k∈Nitself is weakly convergent in L2
loc(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L), with limit, say
gj. Observe that for every compactly supported ϕ∈L2(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L)1,

hencegj=Hfjand the claim follows. Moreover by ( 3.12) and the deﬁnition of Hk, we see
thatHfj∈L2(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L)1. Now using ( 3.12) again and a standard ε/3-argument,
we further conclude that
Hkfjk→Hfjweakly in L2(X,Λn,qT∗X⊗L)1
ask→ ∞ . In particular
/bardblfj/bardbl2=/bardblHfj/bardbl2

where the last equality follows from the fact that

On the other hand, since ¯∂fjk= 0 for all k∈N, it follows immediately that ¯∂fj= 0 as
well, hence

{fjk}k∈Nand hence the theorem. /square
Remark 3.3. A few remarks are in order:
(i) Whenq= 1, the estimate in ( 3.2) is independent of the choice of the K¨ ahler metric ω.
In fact, Demailly [ Dem82 ] and Ohsawa [ Ohs95 ] have respectively explained in detail
why this is the case for the right-hand side of ( 3.2); as for the left-hand side, things are
relatively simple, since it is easy to see that | |2
ω,hdVωcan be expressed in an intrinsic
way in terms of {,}h(to be recalled in Section 4):
(3.13) |u|2
ω,hdVω=√
−1n2
{u,u}h.
Moreover in the case q= 1, if the form vin Theorem 3.2is smooth then every solution
to equation ¯∂u=vis smooth as well. This follows immediately from the ellipticity of
¯∂as a diﬀerential operator acting on ( n,0)-forms.
(ii) In [ Dem00 ] (see also [ Ohs95 ,Dem12b ]), Demailly proved using Ohsawa–Takegoshi’s
a priori inequality ( 2.1) an abstract L2existence theorem for the ¯∂-operator under
the assumption that the metric honLissmooth andvsatisﬁes the additional L2
integrability/integraldisplay
X|v|2
ω,hdVω<∞.
Compared with this result, the point of Theorem 3.2is that it allows the metric hto
besingular . This is crucial in proving Theorem 1.1(and hence Theorem 1.2).
(iii) As the preceding proof indicates, the curvature condition ( 3.1) can be weakened to
an analogous one as in [ Dem82 , Th´ eor` eme 5.1] and the bundle Lcan also be allowed
to have higher rank. We restrict ourselves to the present case in o rder to make the
argument as less technical as possible. As we shall see in the next se ction, Theorem
3.2is suﬃcient for the purpose of the present paper.12 XIEPING WANG
(iv) In the special case when Xis a bounded complete K¨ ahler domain in Cnand
(L,h) = (X×C, e−ϕ)
withϕ∈Psh(X), Theorem 3.2was ﬁrst proved by Chen–Wu–Wang2in [CWW15 ]
using a diﬀerent method, namely by ﬁrst solving the twisted Laplace e quation with
Dirichlet boundary condition on a sequence of smooth subdomains inc reasing toX
and then using these solutions to approximate the desired solution o f the twisted ¯∂-
equation on XwithL2estimate. Although quite interesting, this approach does not
seem to work in the manifold case, since – as far as the author ﬁnds – it requires that
thestrict positivity of the curvature term on the left-hand side of ( 3.1) be preserved
during the regularization process of the singular Hermitian metric h, but in general
the loss of positivity (i.e., the error term δjωin (3.3)) coming from any regularization
sequence {hj}j∈Nis inevitable and diﬃcult to control even locally.
4.Ohsawa–Takegoshi L2extension theorems: the complete K ¨ahler case
Let Ω be a domain in a complex manifold and C∞(Ω,Λp,qT∗Ω⊗L) denote the set of
allL-valuedC∞(p,q)-forms on Ω. Given a Hermitian holomorphic line bundle ( L,h) over
Ω, there is a canonical sesquilinear map
{,}h:C∞(Ω,Λp,qT∗Ω⊗L)×C∞(Ω,Λr,sT∗Ω⊗L)→C∞(Ω,Λp+s,q+rT∗Ω)
which combines the wedge product of scalar valued forms with the He rmitian metric hon
L. More explicitly, for any given u∈C∞(Ω,Λp,qT∗Ω⊗L) andv∈C∞(Ω,Λr,sT∗Ω⊗L),
if we write
u|U=f⊗ζandv|U=g⊗ζ
whereζis a frame of Lover an open subset Uof Ω, then
{u,v}h|U=f∧¯g|ζ|2
h.
Clearly the deﬁnition of {,}his pointwise and hence makes sense for u∈Λp,qT∗
x0Ω⊗Lx0
andv∈Λr,sT∗
x0Ω⊗Lx0withx0∈Ω, even when his merely a singular Hermitian metric
onL.
With the above necessary notion we can now turn to the main goal of this section,
namely proving Theorem 1.1, whose statement we recall for ease of reference.
Theorem 4.1. LetXbe ann-dimensional Stein manifold with a continuous volume form
dVXandΩbe a relatively compact complete K¨ ahler domain in X. SupposeLis a holo-
morphic line bundle over Ωandhis a singular Hermitian metric on Lwith semi-positive
curvature current. Then for every x0∈Ωandsx0∈ΛnT∗

Here and henceforward we use const n,Ω,dVXto denote a generic constant which depends
only onn, Ω anddVX, and may be diﬀerent in diﬀerent appearances. We shall also use
similar notation with obvious meaning in the context.

We now proceed to prove Theorem 4.1. With Theorem 3.2in hand, we do this by
adapting the argument in the proof of [ CWW15 , Theorem 1.3].
Without loss of generality we may assume that dVX=ωn/n!,ωbeing a K¨ ahler form
onX. Fix an arbitrary point x0∈Ω. Let us write ( B,z) = (Bx0,zx0) for the sake of
simplicity, and pick a function ρ∈C∞(X,R) which is positive, strictly log-psh on X\{x0}
and satisﬁes ρ < e−1onΩ andρ=|z|2on a small neighborhood of x0. Similarly as in
[Ohs95 ,Che11 ,CWW15 ] we set
ψε= log(ρ+ε2) andηε=−ψε+ log(−ψε)
for 0<ε≤ε0, whereε0>0 is chosen so small that ψε0<−1 on Ω and the given Hermitian
holomorphic line bundle ( L,h) is trivial over ε0B. A straightforward calculation shows

for all suﬃciently small ε>0. In this way, (Ω ,ω,L,he−(ρ+nlogρ),ηε,λε,Θε,vε) ﬁts into the
framework of Theorem 3.2. Therefore, there is a solution uεto equation ¯∂u=vεwith the

Here we have used the identity in ( 3.13). Deﬁne
sε:=χ(|z|2/ε2)fε⊗ζ−uε.
Thensεis anL-valued holomorphic n-form on Ω. Moreover, since uεis holomorphic on a
small neighborhood of x0ande−nlogρis not integrable near x0(since it is equal to |z|−2n
there), it follows from the ﬁniteness of the left-hand side of ( 4.2) thatuε(x0) = 0 and hence
sε(x0) =fx0⊗ζx0=sx0.
Also recalling that ρ<e−1onΩ and taking into account the trivial fact that
ηε+λε≤6ψ2
ε≤6 log2ρ,
we conclude that
(ηε+λε)−1e−(ρ+nlogρ)≥const
ρnlog2ρ≥constn.
Hence ( 4.2) implies

Consequently s=sεis a holomorphic section of ΛnT∗Ω⊗Las desired in the theorem,
providedε>0 is suﬃciently small. This completes the proof of Theorem 4.1.
Applying Theorem 4.1to the trivial line bundle L= Ω×Cequipped with the metric
e−ϕ,ϕ∈Psh(Ω), we get immediately the following
Theorem 4.3. LetXbe ann-dimensional Stein manifold with a continuous volume form
dVXandΩbe a relatively compact complete K¨ ahler domain in X. Then for every x0∈Ω,
fx0∈ΛnT∗

Remark 4.4. Note that the conclusion of Theorem 4.3holds trivially when the right-
hand side of ( 4.3) is inﬁnite: in this case every holomorphic n-formfon Ω that takes value
fx0atx0automatically satisﬁes the desired estimate ( 4.3), and such an falways exists
(even onX) sinceXis Stein. Incidentally, as Theorem 4.3(and also Theorem 4.1) itself
implies, in order for its conclusion to hold it is suﬃcient to assume that dVXis deﬁned on
a neighborhood of Ω.
On the other hand, as indicated by a result of Chen–Wu–Wang [ CWW15 ], the conclusion
of Theorem 4.3(and hence Theorem 4.1) does not hold in general when the complete
K¨ ahlerness assumption of Ω is dropped.
5.Proof of Theorem 1.2
The key ingredients of the proof are Theorem 4.3and some basic geometric measure
theory. As already mentioned in the Introduction, the idea of using Theorem 4.3in the
proof is inspired by the work of Chen–Wu–Wang [ CWW15 ] (and Demailly [ Dem92 ]). To
get the idea oﬀ the ground, we ﬁrst need to prove the following resu lt:
Theorem 5.1. LetXbe a Stein manifold and E⊂Xbe a closed complete pluripolar set.
ThenX\Ecarries a complete K¨ ahler metric.
In caseE⊂Xis a complex subvariety, this result is well-known and due to Grauert
[Gra56 ] (see also Demailly [ Dem82 ] for closely related results). Note that even in this
special case, X\Ecannot be Stein unless Eis empty or purely one-codimensional, in view
of the second Riemann extension theorem.
Proof. The result is essentially an easy consequence of Theorem 2.2, as we now explain
below.
Letϕbe aC∞strictly psh exhaustion function for Xand letψ:X\E→Rbe aC∞
function such that
ψ=−log(−ρ) onU\E,
whereρis a psh function as in Theorem 2.2with supXρ>−1 andU:={ρ<−1}. Then
one can construct a C∞convex, rapidly increasing function χonRsuch that
ω:=√
−1∂¯∂(χ◦ϕ) +√
−1∂¯∂ψ≥ω0onX\E
for some complete K¨ ahler metric ω0onX.16 XIEPING WANG
We claim that ωis complete on X\E. For this, we may assume without loss of generality
thatXitself is connected (and so is X\E). Suppose {xj}j∈Nis a bounded sequence
in the metric space ( X\E, ω ). Then there is a sequence of smooth curves {γj}j∈N⊂
C∞([0,1], X\E) with uniformly bounded lengths with respect to ω, joining every xjto
a (ﬁxed) reference point in X\U. Sinceω≥ω0onX\Eandω0is complete on X, we
may assume that the sequence {xj}j∈Nitself converges in Xby passing to a subsequence if
necessary. What now remains is to show that the limit of {xj}j∈Nlies outside E. Suppose
the contrary and set
tj:= inf/braceleftbig
t∈[0,1]:γj([t,1])⊂U/bracerightbig
, j∈N.
Clearly 0< tj<1 andγj(tj)∈∂U={ρ=−1}for all suﬃciently large j. Observe also
that
ω≥√
−1∂¯∂/parenleftbig
−log(−ρ)/parenrightbig
≥√
−1∂log(−ρ)∧¯∂log(−ρ) onU\E.
It then follows that
√

tj/parenleftbig
dlog(−ρ)/parenrightbig
(γ′(t))dt
= log(−ρ(xj))→ ∞ asj→ ∞,
contradicting the boundedness of {lengthω(γj)}j∈N. Therefore the limit of {xj}j∈Nlies
outsideE, and hence ωis complete on X\E. /square
Remark 5.2. If we denote by dωanddω0the distance functions on X\EandXassociated
toωandω0, respectively, and by χU\Ethe characteristic function of U\E, then the
preceding argument actually shows the estimate
dω(x,x0)≥max/braceleftBig
dω0(x,x0), χU\E(x) log(−ρ(x))/√
2/bracerightBig
, x∈X\E, x0∈X\U.
This, of course, implies the completeness of ω.
We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.2.
Proof of Theorem 1.2.The uniqueness part of the theorem is clear, since two psh function s
on Ω which coincide almost everywhere are actually equal everywher e. So it suﬃces to prove
the existence part.
Let us ﬁrst reduce the problem to the case when Ω ⊃Kis a relatively compact Stein
domain in the ambient manifold, which we denote by X. To this end, let ρbe a psh
function on X, continuous outside Kand satisfying ρ−1(−∞) =K(see Theorem 2.2).
Choose an open set U⊂Xsuch thatK⊂U⊂⊂X, and set
/tildewideρ:=/braceleftBigg
max/braceleftbig
ρ,inf
∂Uρ/bracerightbig
onX\U;
ρ onU.
Then/tildewideρis a psh function on Xwith/tildewideρ−1(−∞) =K. Replacing Ω by any connected
component of {/tildewideρ<inf∂Uρ}, we may assume in what follows that Ω is a relatively compact
Stein domain in X.
Now Ω\Kis a relatively compact complete K¨ ahler domain in X, in view of Theorem 5.1.
Writen= dim CXand ﬁx a continuous volume form dVXonX. Givenϕ∈Psh(Ω\K), we
can therefore invoke Theorem 4.3to assign to every point x∈Ω\Ka holomorphic n-form

where the constant involved is independent of x∈Ω\K. By the Hartogs extension theorem
for holomorphic forms (see, e.g., [ Ser55 , p. 22, Corollaire du Th´ eor` eme 3]), each such fx
extends holomorphically to Ω. With a slight abuse of notation, we still d enote the extension
byfx.
We next prove the psh extendibility of ϕacrossK. By a classical result of Lelong, it
suﬃces to show that every point of Kadmits a small neighborhood on which ϕis bounded
above. Fix an arbitrary point x0∈K. Since the problem is local, we may assume without
loss of generality that Ω is a bounded pseudoconvex domain in Cncontaining x0. Let
z= (z1,...,z n) be the coordinate of Ω. Identifying xwith its coordinate z=z(x) andfx
withfx/dz1∧···∧dzn, we conclude from ( 5.1), after shrinking Ω if necessary, that
(5.2) eϕ(z)≤const|fz(z)|2and/integraldisplay
Ω\K|fz|2e−ϕ≤const,
where the integral involved is taken against the Lebsesgue measur e onCn. To proceed with
the proof we now recall that as a polar subset of Cn∼=R2n,Khas Hausdorﬀ dimension
at most 2n−2 (see, e.g., [ AG01 , Theorem 5.9.6]). This enables us to make use of a result
of Shiﬀman (see [ Har77 , Lemma 2.3] or [ Dem12a , Chapter 3, Lemma 4.7])), according to
which we can ﬁnd by suitably selecting aﬃne linear coordinates for Cna polydisc ∆′×∆′′⊂
Cn−1×Ccentered at z0=z(x0) =:(z′
0,z′′
0) such that
(∆′×∂∆′′)∩K=∅.
By shrinking ∆′if necessary, we further arrive at
/parenleftbig
∆′×(∆′′\(1−ε)∆′′)/parenrightbig
∩K=∅
for some suﬃciently small ε > 0. The remaining argument is the same as in the last
paragraph of the proof of [ CWW15 , Theorem 1.2]. Choose R, r> 0 such that
1−ε<r<R< 1
and ballB⊂⊂∆′centered at z′
0. Then the Cauchy estimate for holomorphic functions
and inequalities in ( 5.2) imply
