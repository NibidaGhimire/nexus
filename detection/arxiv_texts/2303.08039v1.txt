Abstract
Recently, more and more people study online for the conve-
nience of access to massive learning materials (e.g. test ques-
tions/notes), thus accurately understanding learning materi-
als became a crucial issue, which is essential for many ed-
ucational applications. Previous studies focus on using lan-
guage models to represent the question data. However, test
questions (TQ) are usually heterogeneous and multi-modal,
e.g., some of them may only contain text, while others half
contain images with information beyond their literal descrip-
tion. In this context, both supervised and unsupervised meth-
ods are difﬁcult to learn a fused representation of questions.
Meanwhile, this problem cannot be solved by conventional
methods such as image caption, as the images may con-
tain information complementary rather than duplicate to the
text. In this paper, we ﬁrst improve previous text-only repre-
sentation with a two-stage unsupervised instance level con-
trastive based pre-training method ( MCL :Mixture Unsuper-
vised Contrastive Learning). Then, TQ-Net was proposed
to fuse the content of images to the representation of het-
erogeneous data. Finally, supervised contrastive learning was
conducted on relevance prediction-related downstream tasks,
which help the model to effectively learn the representation of
questions. We conducted extensive experiments on question-
based tasks on large-scale, real-world datasets, which demon-
strated the effectiveness of TQ-Net and improve the precision
of downstream applications (e.g. similar questions "2.02%
and knowledge point prediction "7.20%). Our code will be
available, and we will open-source a subset of our data to
promote the development of relative studies.
Introduction
Nowadays, more and more users prefer to learn courses or
take tests from the online learning system. Owning a great
number of question materials, these platforms are expected
to design an automatic model to provide personalized test
and practice lists to effectively improve the weak knowledge
of different users, such as recommending similar or related
knowledge-point exercises to users, which they are poorly
learned.
The key ability of this automatic model would be distin-
guishing various question data, or we can say, extracting the
better representation of question data. In previous works,

were the main solutions: models trained with the supervised
questions text data. However, language models cannot sat-
isfy all subjects, like geometry questions for example. In
other words, images contain information that are also im-
portant to lots of situations.
But the representation of questions cannot be solved by
conventional methods such as image caption, as the im-
ages may contain information complementary to the text.
It should explore a balance between language model (LM)
and multi-modal methods. How to design an effective rep-
resentation learning method of the heterogeneous questions
became a hard and valuable problem.
Moreover, supervised methods pay expensively for the
detailed labels marked by the different professionals. Re-

the same family of augmentations ( t1Tandt2T) and applied to each question instance to obtain two correlated views.

was potential to be close to or even better than the repre-
sentation learning capability of supervised methods without
expensive cost.
From view of that, we design the TQ-Net to deal with the
heterogeneous input and propose a contrastive learning (CL)
pre-training(Chen et al. 2020a; He et al. 2020a; Grill et al.
2020; Chen and He 2020; Wu et al. 2020; Radford et al.
2021a; Zbontar et al. 2021) method to solve the dilemma of
representation learning.
On the basis of all the above, we proposed two strategies
to achieve a better unsupervised pre-training for questions:
(1) Separately pre-training the image/text stream encoders
and ﬁne-tuning together. (2)Uniformly pre-training the two-
stream encoder. Experiments show that the latter was more
beneﬁcial to the representation learning of questions.
Our contribution could be concluded as follows:
• We proposed the MCL (Mixture Unsupervised
Contrastive Learning) mechanism to improve the
text representation of questions. MCL is a two-stage
unsupervised pre-training method which means that the
model is ﬁrst pre-trained in MLM (Masked Language
Model) and then pre-trained in instance level CL (Con-
trastive Learning) framework (vs. modal level). The
performance of MCL on both frozen and ﬁne-tuning
experiments are much better than the masked LM
method.
• We proposed a new model named TQ-Net and instancelevel CL conducted to fuse the content of images to the
representation of heterogeneous data. Compared to pre-
vious question-based model (text only ones and multi-
modal ones), our proposal improves precision of down-
stream applications signiﬁcantly.
• We proposed a supervised contrastive learning frame-
work, named SCL , which help the model to effectively
learn the representation of questions on relevance-related
downstream task than traditional methods.
Related Work
Question Representation Learning (Yu et al. 2014)
deﬁned the representation and similarity measure of text
questions based on a word and knowledge tree strategy.
(Pardos and Dadu 2017) used the skip-grams and bag-of-
words to formulate the representation. (Liu et al. 2018)
designed the MERL: a model consists of CNN and LSTM
module, and fused the embeddings of various modals,
learning the representation by the supervised training. (Yin
et al. 2019) proposed the QuesNet: a Holed-Language-
Model to extract the representation of questions data. This
method needed three steps: (1) Embedding pre-training by
auto-encoder for recovering the modal data to learn the
embedding of different modal inputs. (2) Model pre-training
for ﬁlling up every word with both the left and right side
context of it. (3) Fine-tuning the whole network on the
downstream tasks. QuesNet was complex to deploy andthe performance would be limited because the embedding
extractor and the model were separately trained.
Unsupervised Pre-training of Multi-modal Content
VideoBERT (Sun et al. 2019b) built the dictionary for
videos, and proposed using visual and text tokens as the
input of the model. This method borrowed the idea of BERT
(Devlin et al. 2018) to do the pre-training task: (1) Masked
token prediction (2) Text-Video matching prediction. (Li
et al. 2020; Su et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2020) applied images
as the visual input, these works introduced a detector or
improved the pre-training tasks to capture the semantic
information for better fusion. Moreover, CLIP (Radford
et al. 2021b) aims to maximize the similarity between
different modal inputs, but it is hard to take advantage of
the difference in various modals to build a cooperative
representation learning of heterogeneous data.
Contrastive learning. The CL compares two augmented
views of the same input to capture semantic-invariant fea-
tures, such as object-related characteristics. Some studies
(Chen et al. 2020b; He et al. 2020b; Chen et al. 2020c,d;
Chen, Xie, and He 2021) attract the positive (similar) pairs
and repulse negative (different) pairs to learn the repre-
sentations. Other studies (Chen and He 2020; Caron et al.
2021) also provide a self-distillation framework, which only
matches positive samples to learn the representations.
Method
Network Architecture
We ﬁrst introduce the novel two-forward model TQ-Net as
shown in Figure 2 and 4 to effectively extract the represen-
tation of the heterogeneous test data. Our proposal uses the
text encoder and image encoder to respectively process the
words and images input.
Note that, here we use the pre-norm structure transformer
to build self attention module as shown in Figure 4 (b). And
the shortcut was introduced to the forward pass, which used
to fuse the original modal information, it can also be inter-
preted as fusion of joint (low-level) and coordinated (high-
level) information without lose of details.
Mixed Unsupervised Contrastive Learning
Our unsupervised pretraining was shown in Figure 2 (step
1) as the ﬁrst pretext task to push the text encoder to a suit-
able hidden space rather than directly do the multi-modal
contrastive learning, as latter would easily cause the pattern
collapse.
After that, we can apply the multi-modal contrastive
learning as shown in Figure 2 (step 2): The Query/Key en-
coder have same architecture and initialization. Each net-
work consist of three modules: visual encoder (ResNet-50),
text encoder (BERT) and fusion module (multi-head at-
tention). In this paper, we use the random masked words
and clipped windows as the augmentation of questions as
shown in Figure 2 (b). The augment technologies of im-
ages are same as the (Chen et al. 2020d). Each input af-
ter augmentation consist of visual list [fI1g;fI2g; ::fIbg]and text list(words and formula) [T1; T2; :::Tb]. We will
use the shufﬂe batch-normalization (BN) (He et al. 2020a),
which collects the inputs from different GPUs to do the
BN to avoid the device information leakage, to get key

where m2[0;1)is a momentum coefﬁcient (here we use
m=0.999).
Note that, here we use the two-stage unsupervised con-
trastive learning mechanism to further enhance the represen-
tation ability of TQ-Net. In the ﬁrst stage, MLM (Masked
Language Model) was used to pre-train the text encoder
(BERT in our model). In the second stage, SEQ (separately)
andUNI (uniformly) pre-training were conducted. For SEQ,
text modal and image modal were separately pre-trained in
an unsupervised contrastive learning manner. For UNI, text
modal and image modal were pre-trained in an unsupervised
contrastive learning manner to view the question as an in-
stance where augmentation applied to both text and image
simultaneously (instance-level contrastive learning). Also, a
comprehensive comparison of SEQ and UNI methods was
shown in experiments.
Supervised Contrastive Learning
Though we have proposed an unsupervised learning method
for heterogeneous question data, because the data struc-
ture could be greatly divergent, our model would sometimes
over-ﬁtting the noise. So based on our unsupervised pre-
training method, we propose a supervised contrastive learn-
ing (SCL) ﬁne-tuning method to build the knowledge anchor
for models as shown in Figure 2 (step 3). The positive pairs
in SCL come from human-labelled similar questions rather
than data augmentation.
In educational applications, the similar question classiﬁ-
cation is an important task to evaluate the performance of ed-
ucational model. And here we could adapt this binary clas-
siﬁcation dataset to do our supervised contrastive learning.

Let the seed question’s feature be qseed, and its sim-

questions in the dataset as the negative pairs of the seed.
Note that, the label matrix no longer be diagonal, the label
matrix was calculated by the ground truth: if questions pair
is similar then label is 1, else the label is 0. Some questions
could have multiple similar questions, so it’s necessary to
check the ground truth label matrix rather than applying aug-
mentation as unsupervised contrastive learning used shown
in Figure 3. Another situation is even a question do not have
similar questions, it can be input as dissimilar with other
questions to learn the discrimination.
Experiments
The experiments of this paper mainly consist of two parts:
(1) Similar test question, (2) Knowledge Point Prediction
(Classiﬁcation). In ﬁrst part of experiments, we mainly ex-
plored the effective framework of TQ-Net to learning an
effective representation of questions on both unsupervised
and supervised ways. In second part, we evaluated TQ-Net
compared to text-only methods and previous SOTA hetero-
geneous methods to illustrate the effectiveness of our pro-
posal.
Dataset
The pre-training dataset we used came from an online ed-
ucation system and was collected from middle school math
tests and exams as shown in Table 1. About 30% of ques-
tions contain images. The maximum number of images for
one question is 10. We only use the text and images of ques-
tions and options without label to do the unsupervised rep-
resentation learning.
Implementation details
All our experiments use 8 1080-Ti GPUs. In the pre-
training experiment, we follow the same settings of hyper-
parameters with ofﬁcial MoCo v2 code1. In the similar

test question classiﬁcation task, we use SGD optimizer with
lr=3e-4, momentum=0.9, and weight decay=5e-4. The train-
ing batch size was set to 32. In the knowledge classiﬁcation
task, we use the optimizer setting the same as similar test
question, the training batch size was set to 64. Our augmen-
tation for images are same as the visual contrastive learning
methods (He et al. 2020a; Chen et al. 2020c), such as resize,
crop, colour jitter, ﬂip and blur.
Similar test question
The similar test question is a relevance prediction task,
which needs to predict whether two given questions are sim-
ilar or not. In this task, training dataset contains 27637 ques-
tion pairs, and 4526 pairs for evaluation. The labels were
marked by multiple professionals to indicate whether the
two questions in a pair are similar or not based on knowledge
points. Speciﬁcally, each question in the train/test dataset
will have at least 5 similar questions, and there is no overlap
between the train and test datasets. In default, two random
questions are not similar with a high probability. In our ex-
perimental setting, the question type is less considered, we
hope that the model captures the knowledge/problem solv-
ing method/background description from the discrimination
of similarity.
We use precision at top-k as the metrics of performance.
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst build the similar mapping for each
question according to the ground truth label, and each ques-tion has at least 5 similar questions on our designed test-
ing datasets. Then based on the prediction result, we build
the predicted mapping. For each question, we would pick
the top-5 largest probability candidate from all the positive
question predictions based on the cosine similarity of em-
beddings. Compared with the ground truth mapping, we cal-
culated the precision at top-5 to illustrate the performance,
as shown in Eq.4. In this paper, we choose the P@5 (re-
sponding to that each question will have at least 5 simi-
lar questions) as the main evaluation metrics of similar test
question for the balance of contingency and generalization.

Similar test question is an essential question-based tasks
for many educational applications. The performance of this
task completely depends on the capability of the model to
extract the representation of various questions. It’s a dif-
ﬁcult problem because of the heterogeneous, multi-modal
data. Most solutions were only based on the text stream, and
few studies as the pioneer to explore the heterogeneous solu-
tions e.g. QuesNet (Yin et al. 2019). In this section, we ﬁrst
explored to improve the representation learning of only text
stream questions method, then introduced the image content
to our framework.

Text Only Input We started from the original text-only
pair training method to illustrate that the contrastive learn-
ing method was more beneﬁcial to learning the representa-
tion. We only use the text stream of our TQ-Net, and ig-
nore the images stream. We respectively used the masked

language model (MLM), contrastive learning (CL) to do the
pre-training, and also our proposed two-stage pre-training
method MCL, which means the model ﬁrst pre-training in
MLM and then pre-training in CL framework (two-stage
pre-training). To show the advantage of pre-training, we pro-
vided the performance of random initial and the ofﬁcial pre-
training BERT by (Wolf et al. 2020).
According to the result in Table 2, compared to the MLM
method, CL and MCL showed that contrastive learning was
more helpful for representation learning. Note that, the pre-
training task of CL was also a process to distinguish sim-
ilarities. Thus, we want to ﬁgure out whether this method
would help supervised representation learning. We design
the SCL training method. Figure 3 shows the difference be-
tween SCL and traditional pair training on downstream sim-
ilar question classiﬁcation task. As the result shown in Table
2, it’s reasonable to believe that SCL beneﬁts the supervised
representation learning and downstream tasks compared to
the previous method.
Multi-modal Input Next, we would introduce the image
content to improve the question representation learning. The
main strategy of previous multi-modal fusion methods like
(Sun et al. 2019b; Li et al. 2020; Radford et al. 2021a; Su
et al. 2019; Li et al. 2020) could be concluded into two types:
joint or coordinated representation fusion as shown in Fig-
ure 4. We ﬁrst tested which one of these methods was more
suitable for the question data representation learning.
The result as Table 3 shows that coordinated fusion may
be suitable for question data. Thus, we use TQ-Net as a co-
ordinated fusion method to process these data. We suppose
these supplementary-each-other multi-modal data is hard to
do the representation learning compared to image caption
tasks. The reason may come from that the text is not the la-Fusion Fine-tune P@5

bel or caption of the images, what’s more, the relationship
between the image and text modal tends to be more inde-
pendent.
In view of that, we proposed two strategies to achieve
a better unsupervised pre-training for heterogeneous ques-
tion data to improve the downstream performance. (1) Sep-
arately pre-training the image/text encoders of TQ-Net. (2)
Uniformly pre-training the TQ-Net as an instance encoder.
To verify our argument, we test the contrastive way like
CLIP, and the result as shown in Table 4 is much worse
(lower 6%) than our instance contrastive learning. Our pro-
posal greatly improves the capability of processing multi-
modal test question data compared to the previous hetero-
geneous solution. Moreover, both SEP and UNI have better
P@5 performance in pair and SCL mechanisms than text-
only methods (Table 2). UNI was more beneﬁcial to the un-
supervised pre-training process than the frozen experiment.
In the ablation study section, we would ﬁgure out where the
performance improvement came from.
Knowledge Point Prediction
We also invite the knowledge point prediction task to evalu-
ate our model knowledge anchor. We have 118919 questions
on the training dataset, and 29565 on the testing dataset.
Each question has knowledge point labels labelled by pro-
fessional teachers. The total number of knowledge points is
391. So the knowledge point prediction task could be con-
sidered as a classiﬁcation task, and we pick the F1 score as
the metric of evaluation. We froze all the parameters of TQ-
Net and introduce a linear classiﬁer to do classiﬁcation. For
comparing, we provided the QuesNet and different initial
experiments of BERT, both without freezing parameters.
According to the results Table 5, our TQ-Net shown great
power to solve the unsupervised representation learning of
heterogeneous test questions data.
Ablation Study
To ﬁgure out where the improvement of the multi-modal per-
formance came from, we respectively evaluated the model
on different pair structure datasets in similar test questionKP (class num =391)

experiments: (1) Text-Text: two questions of pair do not con-
tain images. (2) Text-Image: one question have images and
the other one is text-only. (3) Image-Image: two questions
of pairs both have images.
According to Table 6, we found that the text input domi-
nates the information of questions. Even without visual con-
tent, the model has the capability to represent the questions.
However, the most improvement of TQ-Net performance
came from the text-only question pairs. It shows that our
multi-modal contrastive learning help to learn better repre-
sentations of questions. Thus, we proposed that the visual
content was necessary, which greatly beneﬁts representation
learning.
Conclusion
In this paper, we improved the pre-training method of the
previous text-only question representation with a two-stage
contrastive learning mechanism. We also explored the fusion
method of the image content, where a model named TQ-
Net and instance-level contrastive learning was proposed
to process the heterogeneous data. Moreover, we provided
unsupervised and supervised training methods, which help
the model to effectively learn the multi-modal representa-
tion of question data. We conducted extensive experiments
to demonstrate the effectiveness of TQ-Net and improve the
precision of downstream applications (especially relevance-
related tasks). We will continue to explore possible improve-
ments for the following in the future: (1) method for better
fusion of the image content. (2) more effective contrastive
learning framework for multi-modal or heterogeneous data.
We hope this work builds a solid basis for future multi-
modal and heterogeneous representation research and helps
boost more educational applications.References
