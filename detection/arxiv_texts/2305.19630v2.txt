Abstract
Spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomena in the transverse ﬁe ld mixedp-spin glass
model in ﬁnite dimensions are studied with Nishimori’s gauge theory. Us eful identities in
the gauge theory enable us to study Z2-symmetry breaking. It is proven that ferromagnetic
long-range order and spontaneous magnetization at an arbitrary temperature are bounded
by those on the Nishimori line in the corresponding classical model. Th ese bounds imply
that neither ferromagnetic long-range order nor spontaneous m agnetization exists in spin
glass phase. It is proven also that the ferromagnetic susceptibility has an upper bound in
paramagnetic and spin glass phases.
1 Introduction
Nishimori’s gauge theory is a useful tool to understand prop erties of disordered spin systems
[1, 2]. The paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases include t he Nishimori line, where one can
obtain several exact resultsofphysical quantities, sucha stheexact internal energy, boundonthe
speciﬁc heat and identities among correlation functions. T hese informations are quite helpful to
understand the phase transition of spin glasses in ﬁnite and inﬁnite dimensions. It is well-known
that ﬂuctuation of order parameters is suppressed on the Nis himori line. The absence of replica
symmetry breaking on the Nishimori line has been argued in cl assical Ising spin glasses [3].
On the other hand, in quantum disordered spin systems, there are several important studies
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. They are less than those in classi cal Ising spin glasses, since the
non-commutativity of operators yields considerable compl ication for evaluations. Nonetheless,
Nishimori’s gauge theory is still useful for quantum spin gl asses to draw their phasediagrams [4].
Bounds on some quantum correlation functions are evaluated in terms of the classical spin model
on the Nishimori line. The absence of ferromagnetic long-ra nge order on the Nishimori line in
the classical Ising spin glasses implies that there is also n o long-range order in the corresponding
quantum systems. Although the Nishimori line lies out of the spin glass phase, the gauge theory
gives also helpful information of spin glass phase in quantu m spin glass systems.
In the present paper, several identities on the Nishimori li ne are derived, and utilized them
to study phase transitions in quantum spin glass systems. Th ese identities represent correlation
functions in quantum systems at arbitrary temperatures in t erms of those in the corresponding
classical Ising systems on the Nishimori line. These repres entations enable us to prove well-
known properties of the spontaneous Z2-symmetry breaking in quantum spin glass systems. It
1is proven that there is neither ferromagnetic long-range or der nor spontaneous magnetization in
spin glass phase. The square of magnetization and spontaneo us magnetization for any temper-
ature are bounded by those on the Nishimori line in the corres ponding classical model without
the transverse ﬁeld. Several assumptions and Nishimori’s g auge theory enable us to prove the
ﬁniteness of ferromagnetic susceptibility in spin glass ph ase transition, which is observed also
experimentally [13]. A bound on the ferromagnetic suscepti bility is given by a correlation func-
tion in the corresponding classical model on the Nishimori l ine. Under acceptable assumptions,
it is proven that the ferromagnetic susceptibility under ze ro external ﬁeld does not diverge in
paramagnetic and spin glass phases at any lower temperature in quantum spin glass systems.

Note 3.2 It is possible that Nishimori’s gauge theory is applicable to models with random in-
teractions satisfying other distributions, for example th e binomial distribution deﬁned by
P(Jp
X) :=rpδ(Jp
X−µp)+(1−rp)δ(Jp
X+µp)
for0≤rp≤1. In this distribution, the NM is deﬁned by
βp=K(rp)
for allp∈Q, where the function K(rp)is deﬁned by
K(rp) :=1
2logrp
1−rp.
Throughout the text in the present paper, the Gaussian random p-spin interactions are treated
for convenience and simplicity, since recent mathematical studies on spin glasses have been
progressed mainly for Gaussian random interactions. Sever al results have been obtained by com-
binations of Nishimori’s gauge theory and recent useful stu dies [14]. Extensions of theorems in
the present paper to those for the binomial distribution are straightforward.
4Z2-symmetry Breaking in the Spin Glass Transition
Here, we study spin glass phase transition in the transverse ﬁeld mixed even p-spin glass model.
LetQ2be a ﬁnite set of positive even integers, and deﬁne Q:={1}∪Q2and consider the trans-
verse ﬁeld mixed even p-spin glass model with Qand coupling constants ( β,∆,µ,h). Note that
the perturbation (∆ 1,µ1)/ne}ationslash= (0,0) breaks the Z2-symmetry. Theoperator o1is the ferromagnetic
order operator, which measures the Z2-symmetry breaking.
4.1 Absence of long-range order and spontaneous magnetizat ion
First, absence of spontaneous ferromagnetic magnetizatio n is proven in addition to that of
ferromagnetic long-range order, already indicated by Mori ta, Ozeki and Nishimori [4].
Theorem 4.1 Consider the transverse ﬁeld mixed even p-spin glass model with Q={1}∪Q2
for an arbitrary β >0, and deﬁne NM by µp/∆2
ptaking the same value for all p∈Q2. If there
is no ferromagnetic long-range order for (β=µp/∆2
p,∆1= 0,∆p,µ1= 0,µp,h= 0)on the NM
in the corresponding classical spin glass model, then there is no ferromagnetic long-range order

β= 0. (20)
for any(β,∆1= 0,∆p,µ1= 0,µp,h/ne}ationslash= 0)in the model with the quantum perturbation by the
transverse ﬁeld h.
If there is no spontaneous ferromagnetic magnetization for (β=µp/∆2
p,∆1,∆p,µ1,µp,h=

ferromagnetic magnetization

ﬁeldh.

4.2 Bound on the susceptibility
Finally, let’s prove that the ferromagnetic susceptibilit y has a ﬁnite upper bound under accept-
able assumptions in the Z2-symmetry breaking phase transition of the transverse ﬁeld mixed
evenp-spin glass model. For ∆ 1= 0, regard the sample expectation of the magnetization as a
function of the deterministic longitudinal ﬁeld µ1and the system size L. Deﬁne a function

Assumptions Consider the transverse ﬁeld mixed even p-spin glass model with Q={1}∪Q2
for arbitrary coupling constants (β,∆1= 0,∆p,µ1,µp,h). Assume the following A1 and A2.
A1. There exists a positive number Cindependent of L, such that

A1 is valid, if the function E/an}bracketle{tτiτj/an}bracketri}htβNdecays exponentially for |i−j| ≫1 on the NM in the
paramagnetic phase of the classical mixed p-spin glass model for h= 0,∆1= 0,µ1= 0. Note
that A1 provides a suﬃcient condition for the absence of long -range order in the paramagnetic
phase of the classical model assumed in Theorem 4.1.
A2 implies that the singular behavior of the susceptibility forµ1/ne}ationslash= 0 becomes weaker than that
forµ1= 0.
Theorem 4.2 Consider the transverse ﬁeld mixed even p-spin glass model with Q={1}∪Q2

Note 4.3 The results in Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2 are well-known genera l properties of
spin glasses, which are valid also in the classical systems g iven byh= 0. These results are
consistent with rounding eﬀects obtained in Ref. [6, 17, 7]. The ﬁniteness of susceptibility is
observed experimentally in spin glasses [13]. Nishimori’s gauge theory is useful also for under-
standing experimental results in disordered spin systems.
