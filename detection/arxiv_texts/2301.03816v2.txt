Abstract
Light dark matter particles may be produced in electron and positron beam dumps
of the International Linear Collider (ILC). We propose an experimental setup to
search for such events, the Beam-Dump eXperiment at the ILC (ILC-BDX). The
setup consists of a muon shield placed behind the beam dump, followed by a multi-
layer tracker and an electromagnetic calorimeter. The calorimeter can detect electron
recoils due to elastic scattering of dark matter particles produced in the dump, while
the tracker is sensitive to decays of excited dark-sector states into the dark matter
particle. We study the production, decay and scattering of sub-GeV dark matter
particles in this setup in several models with a dark photon mediator. Taking into
account beam-related backgrounds due to neutrinos produced in the beam dump as
well as the cosmic-ray background, we evaluate the sensitivity reach of the ILC-BDX
experiment. We find that the ILC-BDX will be able to probe interesting regions of
the model parameter space and, in many cases, reach well below the relic target.arXiv:2301.03816v2  [hep-ph]  26 Jan 2024Contents

1 Introduction
The International Linear Collider (ILC) has been proposed as the next energy-frontier
facility in particle physics. The physics program of the ILC is well established [1–3]: it in-
cludes measurements of the Higgs boson couplings with unprecedented precision, searches
1for new physics in rare Higgs decays and other channels, and precise top-mass determina-
tion, among other topics. Most studies of the physics potential of the ILC to date focus on
experiments with the detector situated at the main interaction point, where the electron
and positron beams collide head-on, yielding the maximum collision energy.
Recently, it was suggested that, in parallel with the experiments at the main interaction
point, the ILC can pursue a complementary physics program using its beam dumps [4–10].#1
Particle collisions within the beam dumps occur in fixed-target kinematics, with typical
effective energies of O(10) GeV or below. At the same time, since every beam-electron
and beam-positron interacts with the dump, the beam-dump experiments can accumulate
enormous integrated luminosity. This makes the beam dump the ideal place to search for
relatively light new particles with very small couplings to the Standard Model (SM).
The new physics targeted by the beam-dump experimental program is very well mo-
tivated theoretically [12, 13]. Previously studied examples include visibly-decaying dark
photons, axion-like particles, vector bosons associated with gauged lepton flavor symme-
tries, and heavy neutral leptons. In all these cases, it was demonstrated that beam-dump
experiments at the ILC can probe model parameters well beyond the reach of the currently
available experiments and are competitive with proposed future dedicated facilities.
In this paper, we propose a new search for light dark matter using the ILC beam dumps.
It is well known that a stable particle with mass in the MeV–GeV range, interacting with
the SM via a dark photon mediator, is an attractive dark matter (DM) candidate. With
reasonable model parameters, its thermal relic density matches the observed DM abundance
and it is consistent with all astrophysical and experimental constraints. The DM particles
can be pair-produced at the ILC beam dump via virtual dark-photon exchanges or in decays
of dark photons. An electromagnetic calorimeter placed ∼100 m downstream of the beam
dump, behind a lead shield is designed to search for the DM by detecting elastic scattering
of the DM particles on the electrons in the detector material. In addition, in many models
such as inelastic DM [14], the DM particle is the lowest-lying state of a multiplet with small
mass splittings. A long-lived excited state in the same multiplet as the DM, produced at
the beam dump, may propagate through the lead shield and decay into the DM and charged
SM particles. The charged particles can then be detected by a tracker, providing a “visible
decay” signature of the DM. We will estimate the experimental reach in both electron-recoil
and visible-decay signal.
The proposed experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 1. The concept of this experiment
is the same as the Beam-Dump eXperiment (BDX) proposed at JLab [15], and we, therefore,
call our proposal “ILC-BDX.” The advantage of the ILC, compared to the original BDX
proposal, is the higher beam energy as well as availability of both electron and positron
#1In particular, the ILC provides a good opportunity for a positron fixed-target experiment, similar to
the PADME experiment [11] but at a much higher energy.

Figure 1: The ILC-BDX experimental setup consists of the main beam dump, a muon
shield, a decay volume, and a detector. A multi-layer tracker is placed in the decay volume
to measure the charged tracks. The DM particles may be produced at electron and positron
beam dumps via pair-annihilation of positron on an atomic electron, or via bremsstrahlung.
The resulting DM particles can scatter off electrons in the detector and yield observable
electron-recoil events. In models where the DM particle is part of a multiplet, an excited
DM state may be produced. It can then decay into a lighter DM state and SM particles in
the decay volume, producing a visible signature in the tracker.
beams.#2We also note that the experimental setup used here is essentially identical to
that proposed previously for searches for visible dark photons and axion-like particles.
(Detailed design of the detector may be different to optimize the sensitivity for various
searches, but this is outside the scope of this study.) The ILC-BDX can be pursued in
parallel to the previously discussed searches, adding to the rich physics program at the ILC
beam dumps. It is important to emphasize that this program can be pursued in parallel
with the exploration of the Higgs and electroweak physics at the main IP, and can broaden
the capabilities of the ILC to search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) at a
modest additional cost.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the setup
of our proposed experiment for sub-GeV DM search at the ILC beam dumps, and list
formulae used to calculate the number of expected signal events. In Section 3, we discuss
the two types of background (BG) events that occur in this setup, i.e., beam-induced and
cosmic-ray backgrounds, and estimate the number of events expected from each BG. In
Section 4, we introduce five DM models used as benchmarks, i.e., pseudo-Dirac DM with
small and large mass-splitting, scalar elastic and inelastic DM, and Majorana DM. We
then present our estimates of the ILC-BDX sensitivity reach for each model. The main
#2An additional advantage is the availability of polarized beams at the ILC. We will not explore conse-
quences of polarization in this paper, but note that it can be particularly useful in characterizing the new
physics if a non-SM signal is observed.
3findings of our analysis are summarized in Section 5. The Appendix contains the formulae
for cross sections of the relevant dark-photon production processes (Appendix A) and the
DM-electron elastic scattering (Appendix B), as well as some details of our estimates of
neutrino-induced BG rates (Appendix C).
2 Beam dump experiment
We adopt the same experimental setup as that of Ref. [9], which is illustrated in Fig. 1.
For both electron and positron beams, the ILC main beam dumps are planned as absorbers
consisting of water cylinders along the beam axes with the length of ldump = 11 m [16].
The proposed setup consists of a muon shield with the length of lsh= 70 m made of lead, a
cylindrical decay volume with ldec= 50 m and radius of rdec= 3 m with a multi-layer tracker
installed, and a cylindrical detector with the radius of rdet= 2 m and the length of ldet=
0.64 m, behind either of the beam dumps. The multi-layer tracker is designed to detect
the visible-decay signal, while the cylindrical detector is assumed to be an electromagnetic
(EM) calorimeter made of CsI(Tl) scintillating crystals ( n(det)
e−= 1.1×1024cm−3) designed
to detect recoil electrons caused by incoming boosted DM particles (electron-recoil signals).
We focus on the 250 GeV ILC (ILC-250) with the beam energy of Ebeam= 125 GeV in
the lab frame, and the number of incident electrons and positrons into the beam dump of
Ne±= 4×1021/year [1,17–20]. As studied comprehensively in Refs. [5,6,9,21], this setup was
found very sensitive to long-lived BSM particles decaying into visible SM particles thanks
to its thick shield. We will see that, with the calorimeter as a recoil-electron detector, it is
also sensitive to DM particle production.
We study two types of signal events associated with different production mechanisms of
DM particles. If the DM particles are produced in the water beam dump by a BSM interac-
tion (such as dark photons), they are highly boosted and, passing through the muon shield,
scatter off electrons in the calorimeter. Such electron recoils, detected by the calorimeter,
are a typical signal of DM production. On the other hand, the DM particles may also be
produced in in-flight decays of heavier DM-sector particles if, for example, the DM is the
lowest-lying state of a multiplet. The heavier particle, which we denote by χ2, can pass
through the muon shield and then eventually decay into a DM particle χ1and SM particles.
If the decay happens in the decay volume, charged tracks may be observed in the tracker.
This visible-decay signature is used as an additional signal of DM production.
In this work, we focus on five DM models with the dark photon mediator to provide a
benchmark study. They are pseudo-Dirac-fermion DM with small or large mass-splitting,
scalar elastic DM, scalar inelastic DM, and Majorana-fermion DM. The details of each
model are discussed in Section 4. Among the models, the pseudo-Dirac DM with small
mass-splitting, scalar DM, and Majorana DM can be observed as electron-recoil events.
4Meanwhile, the pseudo-Dirac DM with large mass-splitting can produce visible-decay events
in addition to electron-recoil signature; specifically, due to the pseudo-Dirac nature, a
produced dark photon A′decays mainly into χ2¯χ1(orχ1¯χ2) and the heavier DM-sector
particle χ2may decay visibly in the decay volume.
The number of signal events is schematically given by
Nsignal=Ne±×li×nj×σij→A′→DM×Acc, (2.1)
where we consider a particle iin the shower interacting with a particle jin the material
of the beam dump to produce DM particles through an on-shell dark photon A′as the
mediator. The track length le±of a shower electron and positron is provided in Ref. [6]#3,
njis the number density of j, and Acc denotes the detector acceptance discussed below.

Here θA′is the emission angle of A′with respect to the direction of the e±beam in the lab
frame. In all the models we consider, it is assumed that dark photons decay exclusively
into the DM-sector particles, i.e., Br( A′→χ¯χ) = 1, with χbeing a DM sector particle
(χ1and/or χ2). This is justified since decays to SM final states are suppressed by a small
mixing parameter ϵ2.
Let us estimate the acceptance for each type of signal. For a visible-decay event to be
observed, the visible decay of χ2must occur in the decay volume. Noting that A′mainly
decays into a χ1-χ2pair in the models we consider, we approximate the acceptance by

3 Expected backgrounds
Background (BG) events in this experiment are classified into two types: beam-induced
and beam-unrelated. The beam-induced BG events arise from the SM particles produced
by the injected beam at the main beam dump, while the beam-unrelated ones are mainly
due to cosmic-ray muons.
73.1 Beam-induced background
The beam injected into the main beam dumps produces SM particles. In addition to light
particles such as pions, neutrons, and muons, because of the initial high-energy beams,
tau-leptons and heavy mesons ( D,B, and Bc) are also produced by the shower photon
hitting nuclei [9]#6. Both light and heavy particle decays can produce neutrinos, which
pass through the muon shield and reach the detectors to generate the beam-induced BG
events for both the electron-recoil and visible-decay signals.
The neutrino fluxes are calculated with Monte Carlo simulation. We use PHITS 3.25 [23]
for production and transport of SM particles other than heavy mesons. For heavy meson
production, the differential production cross sections obtained by PYTHIA 8.3 [25] are
implemented into PHITS; see Ref. [9] for details. In Fig. 2, we show the neutrino fluxes per
electron injection at the end of the muon shield in the left panel and at the detector behind
the decay volume in the right panel#7. Tau-type neutrino fluxes are negligible, compared
to electron- and muon-types, because the beam energy is not large enough to produce a
considerable number of source particles such as tau-leptons and Ds. Due to the stopping
power of pions, many pions at rest are produced in the beam dump so that the neutrino flux
increases in the low-energy regions. The electron-type neutrinos in a high-energy regime
mainly arise from the decays of Ds.
A source of irreducible BG events for the electron-recoil searches are neutrino-electron
scattering,#8
νe−→νe−,¯νe−→¯νe−, (3.1)
where beam-originated neutrinos scatter on the atomic electrons in the detector material.
The recoil electrons produce electromagnetic showers in the calorimeter, which are difficult
to distinguish from the DM-electron recoil events. From the neutrino flux in the right panel
of Fig. 2, the number of neutrino-originated electron-recoil events is estimated to be around
1/year by imposing Emin= 1 GeV; see Appendix C for details. Neutrino-nucleon scattering
is another source of beam-induced BG for the electron-recoil search. We list the possible
processes below. Note that, in contrast to the neutrino-electron scattering, these processes
provide recoil nucleons in the calorimeter, making this component of the BG potentially
reducible depending on the design of the calorimeter.
•Quasi-elastic scattering — Neutrinos produced at the beam dump or in the muon
shield may interact with material in the calorimeter through the following quasi-
#6Heavy meson production through the electromagnetic-shower photons is taken into account, which is
the dominant channel of heavy meson production in our setup.
#7At the positron beam dump, the positron annihilation yields additional neutrino fluxes, but differences
are negligible above our threshold Emin= 1 GeV.
#8The processes νµe−→µνeandντe−→τνedo not contribute because the neutrino flux above the
threshold energy, Eν≥(m2
µ−m2
e)/2me≃10.8 GeV and Eν≥(m2
τ−m2
e)/2me≃3 TeV, is negligible.
8elastic scattering processes:
CC : νℓn→ℓ−p,¯νℓp→ℓ+n,
NC : νp→νp, ¯νp→¯νp, νn →νn, ¯νn→¯νn,
where CC (NC) denotes charged (neutral) current interaction. Among these, the
processes νen→e−pand ¯νep→e+nwill produce an electromagnetic shower in the
calorimeter and thus potentially be misidentified as an electron-recoil signal. The
number of such events is conservatively estimated as 2 ×102/year using the simulated
neutrino flux (Fig. 2 right); see Appendix C for details. Other processes are without
electromagnetic showers, and thus we expect them to be distinguishable from the
signal events.
•Neutral pion production — In the detector, muon-type neutrinos may produce reso-
nant neutral pions ( π0) decaying into photons:
CC : νµn→µ−pπ0,¯νµp→µ+nπ0,
NC : νµp→νµpπ0,¯νµp→¯νµpπ0, ν µn→νµnπ0,¯νµn→¯νµnπ0.
The electromagnetic showers from the photons, which is accompanied by a recoil
nucleon, may be misidentified as electron recoils. As detailed in Appendix C, the
number of the single- π0production is conservatively estimated as 2 ×103/year from
the flux (Fig. 2 right), but this BG may be reducible depending on the calorimeter
design by, for example, using the information on the radius of the electromagnetic
shower.
Since these BG events are due to misidentification of electron recoils, we postpone quanti-
tative studies to the detector-design stage. Instead, in our plots displaying the ILC-BDX
sensitivity of the electron-recoil searches, we show curves corresponding to 10, 100, and
1000 signal events in a 10-year ILC run. These choices illustrate a range of plausible sce-
narios for the degree to which beam-induced background from neutrino-nucleon scattering
can be controlled in practice.
Lastly, we consider the potential beam-induced BG events for the visible-decay signal.
The main source will be the following processes involving strange mesons:
CC : νµn→µ−K0p, ν µn→µ−K0Σ+,
NC : νµn→νµK0Λ0, ν µp→νµK0Σ+, ν µn→νµK0Σ0.
Neutral kaons produced at the end of the muon shield and the surrounding walls of the
decay volume can decay in the decay volume to yield charged tracks mimicking the visible-
decay signal. In Ref. [26] of the SHiP experiment, this class of neutrino-induced BG events

decays in the decay volume by comparing the number of neutrinos between the ILC beam
dump and the SHiP experiment. In the SHiP experiment with 2 ×1020protons on target,
7×1017neutrinos with momentum between 2 GeV and 100 GeV are expected, which
results in ∼104pairs of charged tracks from neutral kaon decays; 99 .4% of them are
rejected by using the topology of oppositely-charged two tracks thanks to the fact that
the BG-originated tracks generally do not point to the beam-target interaction points [26],
and around 60 events are expected to remain as the BG#9. At the ILC-BDX, the number
of neutrinos with momentum between 2 GeV and 100 GeV is estimated as 1 .4×1017per
10-year run (cf. Fig. 2 left), and the ILC-BDX expects 12 BG events with pairs of charged
tracks per 10-year run. Consequently, in the following analysis of ILC-BDX visible-decay
searches, we expect 12 BG events and show the expected exclusion limit sensitivity with
95% confidence-level (C.L.), which corresponds to 7.4 signal events in a 10-year run.
3.2 Cosmic-ray background
The beam-unrelated BG is mainly due to cosmic rays. Figure 3 shows the fluxes of cosmic
muons at sea level and the beam dump area evaluated by EXPACS [28–30] and PHITS [23]#10.
The kinetic energy loss of the cosmic muon from the ground surface to a depth of ∼120
meters below the ground surface is estimated as ρ× ⟨dE/dx⟩ ×120 m ∼50 GeV with the
#9The SHiP experiment has a veto system to reduce the BG further. We do not discuss it because the
reduction strongly depends on the detector setup.
#10Muon-induced neutrons avoid the muon veto and may become a BG event. Evaluation of this effect is
left for future work.
10mass density of the ground ρ∼2.2 g/cm3and the stopping power of muon ⟨dE/dx⟩ ∼
2 MeV ·cm2/g. Due to this large energy loss, the muon flux at the beam dump area is 200
times smaller than that on the ground. Then, the number of the cosmic-muon BG events
for 10 years is estimated as
NBG
cos∼ O(10)·ϵveto. (3.2)
This estimate arises from the following factors:
O(10)∼10 year (operation time)
×10−4muon /cm2/s (cosmic muon flux at beam dump area)
×1002cm2(detector area from top view)
×10−4/muon (hit rate per cosmic muon)
×1312×5 bunch /s (bunch number per second)
×100 ns /bunch . (time window per bunch)
The hit rate is the probability that a cosmic-ray muon on an iron block of size 10 cm ×
10 cm×10 cm will cause an energy deposition above the threshold value of 1 GeV, which is
evaluated in the Monte Carlo simulation. Detectors with smaller cell sizes are sufficiently
realistic, and the above estimation of the hit rate is conservative. The time structure
of the ILC bunches [18, 19] is represented in Fig. 4. The factor ϵvetois the reduction
factor by the cosmic-muon veto, which is typically much smaller than 10%. The deep
underground location of the detector and coincidence time window significantly reduce the
beam-unrelated BG. Consequently, we will neglect the cosmic-muon BG in the rest of this
study.
4 Examples of detectable DM models
We evaluate the sensitivity of the ILC electron and positron beam dump experiments to DM
particles using the formulae in Section 2. Taking into account the beam-induced BG events
coming from the SM neutrinos, we show the prospects of the ILC-BDX for electron-recoil
and visible-decay searches. For the electron-recoil searches, we illustrate parameter spaces
in which more than 10, 102, and 103signal events are expected at a 10-year ILC-BDX run.
For the visible-decay searches, regions with more than 7.4 signal events in a 10-year run are
shown, which corresponds to a 95% C.L. exclusion. Throughout this work, we assume that
the beam-unrelated BG events are negligible, as indicated by the estimates in Section 3.
As benchmark models, we consider a class of DM models in which the DM field is
charged under a new “dark” gauge symmetry, U(1) D. At low energy, where U(1) Dis
spontaneously broken and the dark photon A′acquires a mass mA′, the relevant terms of

and the bunch spacing is ∼600 ns. The number of the beam-unrelated BG events can be
reduced by imposing 100 ns time window per bunch.

We consider five models for the nature of the DM: pseudo-Dirac-fermion DM with small
or large mass-splitting, scalar elastic DM, scalar inelastic DM, and Majorana-fermion DM.
The DM current Jµ
χfor each of these models is listed below, and the recoil profiles for
χe→χescattering in the lab frame are summarized in Appendix B.
The DM models used in this study have four or five free parameters: the dark photon
mass mA′, the DM mass mχ1, the dark fine structure constant αD≡g2
D/(4π), the kinetic
mixing parameter ϵ, and the mass difference ∆ = mχ2−mχ1of DMs if χ2is present. The
DM particles remain in chemical equilibrium with the SM plasma in the early universe
before freezing out. The DM relic density is determined by the cross section of the pair-
annihilation process DM + DM ↔SM + SM. For mχ≪mA′, the annihilation cross section
for these models can be parametrized as σv∝y/m2
χwith y≡ϵ2αD(mχ/mA′)4. The cross
section for which the relic density matches the observed value defines the “relic target” in the
(mχ, y) space. Following the common practice, we will use this two-dimensional parameter
space to illustrate the sensitivity of the ILC beam dump searches. Note however that the
12signal event rates at the ILC-BDX do not depend exclusively on these two parameters and
thus further assumptions are necessary to represent the reach on the ( mχ, y) plane. These
assumptions will be specified in the captions of each of our reach plots.
4.1 Pseudo-Dirac DM
Pseudo-Dirac inelastic DM#11is described by a pair of two-component Weyl fermions ( η, ξ)
that have opposite unit charge under U(1) D. Both a U(1) D-conserving Dirac mass mDand
a U(1) D-breaking Majorana mass mMare present in the low-energy theory, since the U(1) D
symmetry is spontaneously broken. Namely, the Lagrangian has the mass terms
−L ⊃ mDηξ+1
2mM(η2+ξ2) + H .c. (4.3)
Here and below, we assume mD≫mM>0. The mass eigenstates are then given by
χ1=i√
2(η−ξ), χ 2=1√
2(η+ξ) (4.4)
with masses mχ1,2=mD∓mM, and the DM current becomes off-diagonal:
Jµ
χ=i¯χ2γµχ1+ H.c. (4.5)
The ILC-BDX search strategy depends on the mass difference ∆ ≡mχ2−mχ1= 2mM.
For ∆ >2me(large mass-splitting), the heavier DM particle χ2can decay into χ1e−e+
with the partial decay width [33,34]
Γ(χ2→χ1e−e+)≃4ϵ2ααD∆5
15πm4
A′, (4.6)
which results in a visible-decay signal. Otherwise, if ∆ <2me(small mass-splitting),
χ2does not decay inside the apparatus because of the small width of the main decay
channel χ2→χ1+ 3γ. This region of parameter space is accessible only by searches for
the electron-recoil signal.
Figure 5 summarizes our results for the small mass-splitting case, where we take the limit
∆≃0 and fix αD= 0.5 and mA′= 3mχ. The three red solid lines show the sensitivity of the
ILC-BDX recoil-electron search with√s= 250 GeV. The lines correspond to 10 ,102, and
#11If the DM χis a Dirac fermion, the DM current is given by Jµ
χ∝¯χγµχ, and it annihilates to SM
ins-wave two-to-two processes. Constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power in-
jection have ruled out s-wave two-to-two annihilating DM lighter than O(10) GeV as the thermal DM
candidate [31]. This motivates pseudo-Dirac DM as the simplest viable model of sub-GeV fermionic DM.
As another possibility, an inelastic dark matter model consisting of two Dirac fermions has also been
proposed [32].

Figure 6 shows the result for larger mass-splitting, where we fix ∆ = 0 .1mχ1as well
asαD= 0.1 and mA′= 3mχ1. Consequently, the visible-decay signal is expected for
mχ1≳1 MeV. It is noteworthy that the search for visible decays of χ2provides a unique
sensitivity for this model, well beyond that achievable at proposed dedicated future facilities
such as LDMX. This strongly motivates the inclusion of a multi-layer tracker in the decay
volume (see Fig. 1) as a key component of the ILC-BDX design.
Below, we discuss the physics that determines the structure of the reach curves in Figs. 5
and 6.

the ILC are not significant for mχ≲1 GeV.

4.1.1 Small mass-splitting: ∆<2me
Both pair-annihilation and bremsstrahlung are included as the source of signal events,
where on-shell dark photons are produced and decay into a χ2-χ1pair, and either χ2orχ1
is detected as electron recoil.
•Pair-annihilation (recoil-electron) — The DM with mass less than ≃10−2GeV cannot
be detected because of the threshold Emin= 1 GeV. This is because decays of the
dark photon with mass less than√2meEmincannot contribute to signal events since
the energy of the produced dark photon is Elab
A′≃Ee+≃m2
A′/2me. Also, the DM
with mass larger than ≃10−1GeV cannot be produced from decays of the dark
photon because the dark photon mass cannot exceed√2meEbeam. In the positron
beam dump for the DM mass of√2meEbeam/3, primary positron beam production
dominates, and a peak structure arises.
•Bremsstrahlung (recoil-electron) — For the DM mass smaller than ∼10−2GeV, the
number of the recoil-electron events is suppressed by the threshold Emin= 1 GeV.
Since the expected decay angle of the dark photon is ( π/2)·(mA′/EA′), the dark
15photon energy has to satisfy mA′·(π/2)·(ldump+lsh+ldec)/rdet≲EA′to obtain
sufficient angular acceptance. However, the minimum energy of the dark photon is
EA′∼Emin= 1 GeV because of the threshold, and the signal events from the DM
with mass smaller than ∼10−2GeV are suppressed even if the angular acceptance
holds. For the DM with mass larger than 0 .1 GeV, the angular acceptance becomes
worse, and the sensitivity rapidly decreases.
4.1.2 Large mass-splitting: ∆>2me
The new feature in this case is the availability of the visible-decay signal. Here, we discuss
the sensitivity reach for this channel, highlighting each of the DM decay processes. The
results of the electron recoil searches are similar to the case of the small mass-splitting.
•Pair-annihilation (visible-decay) — For ∆ = 0 .1mχ1, the heavier DM with the mass
smaller than ≃10−2GeV cannot decay, and the visible-decay signals do not arise.
Similar to the recoil-electron search, the DM with mass larger than 10−1GeV can-
not be produced because the dark photon mass cannot exceed√2meEbeam. In the
positron beam dump experiment, for mχ1=√2meEbeam/3, the peak structure arises
due to the primary positron beam.
•Bremsstrahlung (visible-decay) — Similar to the pair-annihilation process, for ∆ =
0.1mχ1, the heavier DM with the mass smaller than ≃10−2GeV cannot decay and
produce the visible-decay signals. For 10−1GeV≲mχ, the number of signal events
rapidly decreases because the angular acceptance becomes worse.
4.2 Scalar elastic DM
The model with a scalar elastic DM is described by a complex scalar field χthat is SM-
singlet with unit U(1) D-charge. It is safe from CMB bounds since the DM annihilation
is in p-wave and thus with a suppressed rate. The DM current, originating in the kinetic
term|Dµχ|2, is given by
Jµ
χ=i(χ∗∂µχ−χ∂µχ∗). (4.7)
The analysis results are shown in Fig. 7 with the same notation as in Fig. 5. For the non-
relativistic DM-SM fermion elastic scattering cross section, there is no velocity suppression,
and the constraints from direct detection experiments are significant.

sensitivities of SENSEI [37] and SuperCDMS [13,37].
4.3 Scalar inelastic DM
The scalar inelastic DM is characterized by the dark photon current
Jµ
χ=χ1∂µχ2−χ2∂µχ1 (4.8)
involving two real scalar fields χ1,2that are quasi-degenerate but have non-zero mass dif-
ference ∆ = mχ2−mχ1>0 after the spontaneous symmetry breaking of U(1) D.#13We
focus only on the small mass-splitting case since the large mass-splitting case of the scalar
inelastic DM is similar to that of the pseudo-Dirac inelastic DM. The results of our analysis
are shown in Fig. 8, with the same notation as in Fig. 5.
4.4 Majorana DM
For a Majorana fermion χ, the DM current can be an axial-vector as follows:
Jµ
χ=1
2¯χγµγ5χ. (4.9)
#13The mass difference is realized by terms such as χ2H2after the electroweak (and U(1) D) symmetry

Similar to the scalar DM, the pair-annihilation rate of the DM into SM particles is sup-
pressed by the DM velocity, and a sub-GeV Majorana fermion DM is safe from the CMB
constraints. The results of our analysis for the Majorana DM are shown in Fig. 9, with the
same notation as in the scalar elastic DM case (Fig. 7).
4.5 Existing constraints and projected sensitivities at other ex-
periments
Searches for sub-GeV DM are pursued by accelerator-based experiments and direct detec-
tion experiments. In the accelerator-based experiments, the DM particles may be produced
by beam-beam or beam-target collisions, and the searches are performed either by detect-
ing their scattering off of the SM particles in the detectors, the visible decays of the excited
DM states, or the missing energy/momentum events. In the direct detection experiments,
the DM particles from the halo are searched for by detecting their scattering off of the SM
particles in the detectors. We list the existing constraints included in Figs. 5–9 as follows:
•E137 electron beam dump experiment — The light DM may be produced at the SLAC
electron beam dump by injection of 20 GeV electron beams [44]. The produced DM
particles may be detected by their scattering on electrons in the aluminum and plastic
scintillator 400 m downstream from the beam dump. The visible decays of the heavier

dark sector particles are also detectable at the scintillator [33].
•NA64 — The NA64 experiment [45] at CERN constrains the light DM by analyzing
data from interaction of 2 .84×1011electrons at 100 GeV with an active thick target,
i.e., electromagnetic calorimeter, and searching for missing-energy events. The DM
may be produced in the active target by decays of dark photons generated via the
bremsstrahlung process and secondary positron annihilation with atomic electrons.
•LSND proton beam dump experiment — The light DM may also be produced in the
Los Alamos LSND proton beam dump experiment by injection of proton beams with
kinetic energy of 800 MeV [33,37,46,47]. The DM particles are produced dominantly
byπ0decays at the fixed target, and DM-electron scattering or visible decay events
are detected at the downstream detector.
•MiniBooNE — A search for the light DM produced from the Fermilab 8 GeV Booster
protons with a steel beam dump [48] was conducted by the MiniBooNE-DM collabo-
rations by using data from 1 .86×1020protons on target (POT). To reduce neutrino
backgrounds from charged mesons, off-target running was conducted, and the primary
proton beam was steered above the thin beryllium target and directed into the thick
steel absorber. Charged mesons produced in the thick target are absorbed or decay at
rest, and the neutrino flux is reduced. The DM may be produced by decays of π0and
ηmesons and proton bremsstrahlung plus vector-messon mixing. The produced DM
19may be detected by elastic scattering off nucleons, inelastic neutral pion production,
and elastic scattering-off electrons in the MiniBooNE detector, consisting of 818 tons
of mineral oil and placed 490 m downstream of the beam dump.
•COHERENT CsI — The COHERENT experiment [49, 50] in Neutrino Alley at the
Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Oak Ridge National Laboratory has made the first
measurement of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE νNS) predicted by
the SM. The 1.4 MW beam of 1 GeV protons is directed onto a thick and dense liquid
mercury target at the rate of 1016POT per second. The light DM may be produced
via decays of neutral mesons such as π0andη,π−absorption process by the so-called
Panofsky process π−+p→n+A′, and the dark photon bremsstrahlung process.
The coherent condition, where the neutrino and DM scatters off all nucleons of the
nucleus, is satisfied because of low beam energy and enhances the cross-section of the
detection processes. The neutrino flux is isotropic, and detectors are placed at off-
axis angles from the beam. Although about 99% of π−produced are captured in the
thick target, the majority of π+stops and yields prompt νµflux, and the majority of
µ+yields delayed νeand ¯νµfluxes. Adopting a timing cut, the neutrino background
events lying in delayed timing bins are rejected. The initial COHERENT data using
a 14.6kg CsI[Na] scintillator detector placed at a distance of 19.3 m from the target
set limits on the DM.
•CCM120 — One of the main missions of the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) de-
tector [51] located at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center at Los Alamos National
Laboratory is the light DM search. 800 MeV bunched proton beam is directed onto
a thick tungsten target, and then the DM may be produced from decays of π0. Each
bunch consists of ∼3.1×1013protons with a repetition rate of 20 Hz. The CCM120
detector containing 120 PMTs is a 10-ton liquid argon detector placed at a distance of
20 m from the target. The DM may be detected through coherent elastic DM-neucleus
scattering, quasi-elastic nucleon scattering, and elastic electron scattering. The neu-
trino backgrounds are eliminated by energy and timing selection. An engineering run
with 1.5 months of data set limits on the DM.
•CHARM proton beam dump experiment — The DM particles may be produced at
a proton beam dump experiment operating at the 400 GeV CERN SPS. Decays of
mesons such as π0andηand proton bremsstrahlung processes yield the heavier dark
sector particles, which can be detected via the visible decay signature [52].
•ν-calorimeter I neutrino experiment — The visible-decay search for the heavier dark
sector particles was conducted in the neutrino experiment. Similar to the CHARM ex-
periment, the visible-decay search is sensitive to the meson decays and the bremsstrah-
lung processes [52].
20•γ+missing energy search — The DM may be produced at B-factories by process
e+e−→γ+A′(∗)→γχ¯χ. The mono-photon and missing-energy events at the BaBar
set bounds on the DM models [37,53,54].
•Direct detection experiments — The DM-SM non-relativistic scattering may be de-
tected in direct detection experiments, such as XENON-1T, SENSEI, SuperCDMS
and EDELWEISS [55–61]. The bounds from these direct detection experiments are
included in the shaded gray region of Fig. 7. For the DM-nuclear scattering pro-
cess, the SuperCDMS experiment [58] is sensitive to mχ∼1 GeV because of the
low nuclear recoil energy threshold. Also, the DM-nuclear scattering searches, e.g.,
XENON-1T [55], EDELWEISS [60, 61] and SuperCDMS [59], are sensitive to sub-
GeV DM through inelastic scattering channels: bremsstrahlung radiation and the
Migdal effect. The sub-GeV DMs with MeV to GeV mass may also be explored using
the DM-electron scattering searches, e.g., XENON-1T [56] and SENSEI [57].
As representative future accelerator-based searches for light DM, we included projected
sensitivities at Belle II [62,63], BDX [15], and LDMX [36,37] in Figs. 5-9 to compare with the
sensitivity reaches of the ILC-BDX. Many other future experiments have been discussed in
the literature. For completeness, Figs. 10 and 11 compare the ILC-BDX sensitivity reaches
to a broader set of future experiments. The following experiments are included:
•LDMX — The Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) [36, 37] at the SLAC is an
electron-beam fixed-target missing-momentum experiment that explores the light DM
in the sub-GeV range. Once a single electron collides with a thin tungsten target, the
final state is reconstructed by analyzing the downstream apparatus, which includes a
charged particle tracker and calorimeters. DM signals may be produced via the dark
photon bremsstrahlung process and invisible decays of vector mesons produced by a
hard photon. The LDMX is designed for 4 ×1014electrons on target (EOT) at a 4
GeV beam energy (Phase 1) and is upgraded to 1016EOT at an 8 GeV beam energy
(Phase 2). The sensitivity of Phase 2 is shown in the figures.
•M3— The muon missing momentum (M3) [64] at the Fermilab is a muon-beam
reconfiguration of the proposed LDMX experiment, which would be conducted at a
15 GeV muon beam with 1010muons on target (Phase 1) and 1013muons on target
(Phase 2). The sensitivity of Phase 2 is shown in Fig. 10.
•BDX — The Beam-Dump eXperiment (BDX) [15] at the Jefferson Lab is conducted
with 1022EOT at 11 GeV. DM particles are detected through their scattering on
electrons within a calorimeter approximately one cubic meter in size, situated 20 m
away from the beam dump.
21•NA64e — The future run of the NA64 experiment will be conducted with 5 ×1012
electrons at 100 GeV. In addition to the bremsstrahlung process [65] and secondary
positron annihilation with atomic electrons, the DM may be produced by invisible
decays of vector mesons produced by a hard photon [66].
•NA64 µ— The NA64 µexperiment [65] at CERN may constrain the light DM by
searching missing-energy events through the interaction of muon beams with an active
thick target. The DM may be produced in the active target by decays of dark photons
via the bremsstrahlung process. The sensitivity of the NA64 µwith 2 ×1013muons
at 100 GeV on an active thick target is shown in Fig. 10.
•Belle II — The γ+missing energy search can be conducted at the Belle-II [62]. The
sensitivity of the Belle-II with an integrated luminosity of 50 ab−1is shown in the
figures. In the inelastic DM model with large mass-splitting, if the χ2decays outside
the detector, the final state appears identical to the process of e++e−→γ+
A′, A′→invisible. The same signature arises if the decay vertex of χ2is located
within the detector, but the energy of the decay products is insufficient to be detected.
Alternatively, it is possible to detect the decay products of χ2and reconstruct a pair
of displaced leptons or hadrons (such as pions and kaons) in conjunction with a
single photon. The sensitivity of the displaced signatures at the Belle-II [63] with an
integrated luminosity of 50 ab−1is shown in Fig. 11.
•COH-CryoCsI-1 and COH-CryoCsI-2 — The COHERENT experiment [50] will con-
duct cryogenic operations to eliminate backgrounds emitted from PMTs. A 10 kg
CsI (COH-CryoCsI-1) and a 700 kg CsI (COH-CryoCsI-2) will be operated at 40 K
and placed at a distance of 20 m from the target.
•PIP2-BD — The Proton Improvement Project II (PIP-II) is the first phase of a major
transformation of the accelerator facilities at Fermilab to prepare the DUNE. The
PIP2-BD [67] will be conducted with a graphite target and a 100-tonne scintillation-
only liquid argon detector placed 18 m from the target. The sensitivity of PIP2-BD
with a 1.2 GeV proton bunch consisting of 1 .2×1012protons and a repetition rate
of 100 Hz for five years is shown in Fig. 10.
•DUNE — A near detector of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) [68]
will be located on-site at Fermilab and placed on the beam axis 574 m from the
graphite target. 120 GeV proton beam is directed onto the target with 1 .1×1021
protons on target collected per year.
•DUNE-PRISM — The DUNE-PRISM [69] is the concept to move the DUNE near
detector up to ∼36 m transverse to the beam axis to reduce background induced by
neutrinos.
22•CCM200 — The CCM experiment will be upgraded with the new CCM200 detector
consisting of 200 PMTs and filtered liquid argon [51]. The sensitivity of the CCM200
for a three-year run collecting 2 .25×1022POT is shown in Fig. 10.
•SHiP — The SHiP experiment at CERN may constrain the light DM by the interac-
tion of DMs with neutrino detectors. After 400 GeV proton beam collisions with a
target, the DM may be produced by decays of π0andη, the bremsstrahlung process,
the Drell-Yan-like production, and the associated production with QCD radiation.
The DMs may be detected by elastic scattering off electrons ( χe−→χe−) and off
protons ( χp→χp). In estimating the projected sensitivity of SHiP [70], 5-years of
running corresponding to 2 ×1020POT is assumed.
•FASER — The ForwArd Search ExpeRiment (FASER) at LHC is an experiment
designed to search for light long-lived particles in the very forward region. The
FASER is placed along the beam collision axis, 480 m downstream from the ATLAS
IP. In estimating the projected sensitivity of FASER [71], an integrated luminosity
of 3 ab−1is assumed.
•FLArE — The Forward Liquid Argon Experiment (FLArE) detector [72] is planed
to be placed 620 m downstream from the ATLAS interaction point. DM particles are
produced through the bremsstrahlung proces and meson rare decays at the ATLAS
collision point. The sensitivity in the High Luminosity LHC run with an integrated
luminosity of 3ab−1and 14 TeV proton-proton collision energy is shown in Fig. 10.
•Mathusla — The MAssive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra-Stable neutraL pArticles
(MATHUSLA) at LHC is planned to be located on the surface near ATLAS or CMS.
The detector consists of a 200 m ×200 m ×20 m decay volume, positioned ∼100
m downstream from the IP and ∼100 m above the LHC beam. The decay volume is
covered with a scintillating layer to veto incoming charged particles like high-energy
muons from the IP. In estimating the projected sensitivity of Mathusla [71], χ2decay
in the decay volume is the signal event, and an integrated luminosity of 3 ab−1is
assumed.
•Codex-b — The COmpact Detector for EXotics at LHCb (CODEX-b) has the decay
volume with dimensions of 10 m ×10 m ×10 m and is to be positioned ∼5 m
downstream from the IP at a transverse distance of ∼26 m. The Codex-b detector
is proposed to be constructed in the LHCb cavern. In estimating the projected
sensitivity of Codex-b [71], χ2decay in the decay volume is the signal event, and
LHCb’s ultimate luminosity of 300 fb−1is assumed.
•SeaQuest — The SeaQuest experiment [73] at the Fermilab is a beam dump exper-
iment operated with a 120 GeV proton beam of ∼1.44×1018POT (Phase 1) and
231020POT (Phase 2). The proton beam is dumped onto a thin nuclear target and
thick iron magnet. The DM may be produced through the dark photons, which are
generated by decays of mesons such as π0, η, ω, and η′, proton bremsstrahlung, and
the Drell-Yan production.
•JSNS2— The J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at the J-PARC Spallation Neutron
Source (JSNS2) experiment with 3 GeV kinetic energy protons may be sensitive to
the visible decay of χ2and DM-electron scattering events. Neutral mesons such as
π0andηare produced by proton beam collisions with a mercury target, and the
DM may be produced via decays of such mesons. The JSNS2liquid scintillator-based
detector is located 24 m downstream from the target. The sensitivity of JSNS2[74]
for a one-year run collecting 3.8 ×1022POT/year is shown in Fig. 11.
•MicroBooNE — The Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino program with the liquid ar-
gon time projection chamber (LArTPC) detector MicroBooNE installed along the
Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) may be sensitive to the visible decay of χ2and DM-
nucleon scattering events [75]. The BNB is produced by removing protons from the
Booster accelerator at 8 GeV kinetic energy and colliding them with a beryllium tar-
get using 6 .6×1020POT. The detector is located on the beam axis 470 m from the
BNB target. The dark photons may be produced through three mechanisms: decays
of pseudoscalar meson π0, η, η′→γA′, proton bremsstrahlung, and the Drell-Yan
process.
•SBND — The SBND at the Fermilab is the LArTPC detector installed along the
BNB using 8 GeV kinetic energy protons with 6 .6×1020POT [75]. The detector is
located on the beam axis 110 m away from the BNB target.
•ICARUS — The ICARUS at the Fermilab is the LArTPC detector installed along
the BNB [75]. The detector is located on the beam axis 600 m from the BNB target.
Also, the ICARUS detector is positioned within a 6-degree off-axis angle from the
Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam, which is created by 120 GeV protons
colliding with a graphite target at 7 .7×1021POT.
As the future direct detection experiments, in Fig. 7, we included projected sensitivities
of SuperCDMS [76] and SENSEI [13, 57] at SNOLAB. The sensitivity of the SENSEI
SNOLAB is obtained in Ref. [13] for the planned construction of the 100-gram SENSEI
experiment [57] of exposure over 1-year.

265 Summary
In this paper, we explored the potential of a search for sub-GeV dark matter at the ILC
beam dumps using the ILC-BDX setup. Previous studies of beam dump experiments at
the ILC focused on long-lived BSM particles decaying into visible SM final states. In this
study, on the contrary, we consider DM models where a dark photon connects the stable
DM to the SM sector, and focus on DM detection. Five DM models, i.e., pseudo-Dirac DM
with small and large mass-splitting, scalar elastic and inelastic DM, and Majorana DM are
considered as reference scenarios. At the ILC, electrons and positrons in electromagnetic
shower are produced by the beam injection into the beam dumps. These particles produce
dark photons through the bremsstrahlung and pair-annihilation processes, which in turn
decay to pairs of DM particles. (Pair-production of DM via virtual dark photon exchange
is also possible,) Produced DM particles propagate over a long distance (of order 100 m) to
the detector and elastically scatter with electrons inside the detector, and then the recoil
electrons are detected as a signature of the DM production. For the inelastic DM models,
there is another signal produced by a visible decay of the heavier dark state into the lighter
one and SM particles. The ILC-BDX setup includes a multi-layer tracker designed to search
for this visible-decay signal.
In the DM search at the ILC-BDX, there are two kinds of backgrounds, i.e., the beam-
induced and beam-unrelated BGs. The beam-induced BG is due to neutrinos mainly pro-
duced by meson and lepton decays in the beam dumps. Elastic neutrino-electron scat-
tering in the detector is nearly indistinguishable from DM-induced electron recoil events,
providing irreducible BGs to this search. Inelastic neutrino-nucleus interactions can also
mimic electron-recoil and visible-decay signals, though these backgrounds are potentially
reducible. We evaluated the neutrino-induced irreducible and reducible BGs by using the
neutrino fluxes at the detector calculated with Monte Carlo simulation. We also estimated
the beam-unrelated BG, which comes predominantly from cosmic-ray muons. This BG
component can be significantly suppressed by the deep underground location of the detec-
tor and beam-coincidence time window.
We evaluated the number of DM particles produced at the ILC electron and positron
beam dumps and the rate of expected signal events, i.e., electron-DM recoils and visible-
decays at the ILC-BDX, in our reference models. The predicted signal and background
rates were then used to estimate the sensitivity reach of the ILC-BDX experiment with a
data set corresponding to a 10-year ILC run at√s= 250 GeV. The results for each DM
model are shown in Figs. 5-9. We found that in all five reference models considered here,
the ILC-BDX experiment has sensitivity to regions of model parameter space well beyond
the existing constraints. In many cases, the ILC-BDX can conclusively probe the region
of parameter space where the DM has the thermal abundance consistent with observations
(the “relic target”). We find that while electron and positron beam dumps have similar
27performances, the sensitivity of the latter is somewhat better because the primary positron
beam contributes to the DM production through pair-annihilation on electrons in the dump.
The sensitivity of the ILC-BDX is particularly impressive in models where the visible-decay
signal is available, such as the pseudo-Dirac or scalar inelastic DM models with mass-
splitting ∆ >2me. In such models, the reach of the ILC-BDX significantly exceeds that of
even the most ambitious proposed dedicated searches for sub-GeV DM, such as LDMX.
In the discussion of future searches for sub-GeV dark matter, it is important to note
the complementarity between the electron-recoil technique used by ILC-BDX and the miss-
ing energy/momentum technique used by experiments such as LDMX. The signal rate at
missing energy experiments is simply proportional to the total cross section of DM produc-
tion by the beam electron interactions with the target material. On the other hand, the
signal rate at electron-recoil experiments is proportional to the product of this production
cross section and that of the elastic scattering of DM on target electrons. The relationship
between the production and elastic scattering cross sections is model-dependent. Thus,
analyzing data from both types of experiments will provide an opportunity to identify the
underlying DM model, if a signal is observed with one or both approaches. This is an
exciting possibility, and it strongly motivates pursuing both approaches in parallel in the
future.
In our evaluation of the acceptance of the signal events, we adopted some simplifying
assumptions, for instance, the approximated angular distribution of the heavy DM state
in Eq. (2.5) and radial deviations in Eqs. (2.7) and (2.10). Likewise, several simplifying
assumptions were made in the estimates of the background rates; see Section 3. As a
next step, it would be important to design a realistic Monte Carlo model of the ILC-BDX
detector, and use it to provide a more precise evaluation of both signal and background
rates. Another important direction for future work is to design strategies for handling the
reducible beam-induced BG, such as additional cuts or a veto system, and to evaluate such
strategies quantitatively using Monte Carlo simulations.

C Neutrino-induced background
We evaluate the number of neutrino-induced irreducible and reducible BG events from
the neutrino flux of Fig. 2. The number of irreducible BG events does not depend on the
details of the detector design and is evaluated in the same way as the signal rate calculation
in Section 2. On the other hand, the number of reducible BG events highly depends on
the detector design, so we conservatively take a pessimistic scenario without imposing the
threshold energy of the electromagnetic showers#14. This section describes the detailed
calculations of the number of BG events.
C.1 Irreducible background
The number of neutrino-electron recoil events is expressed by the following formula:
NBG=Ne±X
i=νe,µ,τ,¯νe,µ,τZ
dEiπr2
det·dϕi
dEi·n(det)
e−·ldet·Z
EmindERdσ(ie−→ie−)
dER,(C.1)
where ϕiis the neutrino flux at the detector position (Fig. 2 right) and σ(ie−→ie−)
denotes the neutrino-electron elastic scattering cross section [86,87].
In the left panel of Fig. 12, the number of neutrino-electron recoil events per year is
shown as a function of the threshold Emin. The rate is reduced to NBG
beam∼1/year by
imposing Emin= 1 GeV. By taking into account the irreducible BG events and assuming
no signal events are observed, we estimate the expected upper bounds on the number of
signal events at 95% C.L.#15, shown by the solid lines in the right panel of Fig. 12.
#14The rate of quasi-elastic scattering and pion production processes would not change significantly by
imposing the threshold Emin= 1 GeV because their cross sections are very small for neutrino energy
smaller than 1 GeV.
#15The Poisson 95% C.L. upper bound corresponds to three signal events in the absence of BG events.

of the threshold Emin. Right panel: The number of signal events at 95% C.L. in a 1-year
(blue) and 10-year (red) run as a function of the threshold Emin.
C.2 Reducible background
The number of quasi-elastic scattering events is estimated by the following formula:
NQE=Ne±Z
dEνπr2
det·ldet·dϕνe
dEνn(det)
nσ(νen→e−p) +dϕ¯νe
dEνn(det)
pσ(¯νep→e+n)
,
(C.2)
where ϕνeandϕ¯νeare the electron-neutrino and electron-antineutrino fluxes at the detector
position (see the right panel of Fig. 2), n(det)
n(p)is the neutron (proton) number density of
the detector, and σdenotes the quasi-elastic scattering cross section [87]. In contrast to
the estimation of the irreducible BG events, we do not impose the threshold energy of the
electromagnetic shower; Eq. (C.2) is therefore a conservative estimate. From Eq. (C.2), the
number of the quasi-elastic scattering events per year is estimated as
NQE∼2×102×Ne±
4×1021rdet
2 m2ldet
0.64 m
. (C.3)
32Similarly, the number of the single- π0production events is given by
Npion=Ne±Z
dEνπr2
det·ldet
×(
dϕνµ
dEν
n(det)
n
σ(νµn→µ−pπ0) +σ(νµn→νµnπ0)

n(det)

σ(¯νµp→µ+nπ0) +σ(¯νµp→¯νµpπ0)
+n(det)
nσ(¯νµn→¯νµnπ0))
,
(C.4)
where the single- π0production cross sections are listed in Ref. [87]. Combining the neutrino
flux of the right panel of Fig. 2 and the cross sections in Ref. [87], the number of the pion
production events per year is obtained as
Npion∼2×103×Ne±
4×1021rdet
2 m2ldet
0.64 m
. (C.5)
As in the calculation of NQE, the threshold energy of the electromagnetic shower is not
imposed and thus this estimate is conservative.
