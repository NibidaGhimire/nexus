ABSTRACT
Context. Given the massive spectroscopic surveys and the Gaia mission, the Milky Way has turned into a unique laboratory to
be explored using abundance ratios that show a strong dependency with time. Within this framework, the data provided through
asteroseismology serve as a valuable complement. Yet, it has been demonstrated that chemical traits can not be used as universal
relations across the Galaxy.
Aims. To complete this picture, it is important to investigate the dependence on metallicity of the chemical ratios employed for
inferring stellar ages. We aim to explore di fferent combinations of neutron-capture, odd-Z and αelements as a function of age,
particularly focusing on their metallicity dependence for a sample of 74 giant field stars.
Methods. Using UVES observations, we derive atmospheric parameters and high-precision line-by-line chemical abundances ( <0.04
dex) for the entire set of spectra, which covers a wide spread in age (up to 14 Gyr) and metallicity ( −0.7<[Fe/H]<+0.1). Stellar
ages are inferred from astereoseismic information.
Results. By fitting chemical-age trends for three di fferent metallicity groups, we estimated their dependence on metallicity. Simulta-
neously, we identified those exhibiting stronger correlations with time. We found that the stronger chemical-age relations ([Zr /α]) are
not necessarily the ratios with the smaller dependence on metallicity ([Ce /α] and [Ce /Eu]).
Conclusions. We confirm the [n-capture /α]-age trends for evolved stars, wherein the most significant correlation is evident in stars
with solar-metallicity, gradually diminishing in stars with lower iron content. The lack of homogeneity within the metallicity range
highlights the intricate nature of our Galaxy’s star formation history and yield production. The dependence on metallicity of the yields
involving s-process elements and the influence of radial stellar migration pose challenges to relying solely on chemical abundances
for dating stars. These findings contest the feasibility of establishing universally applicable chemical clocks valid across the entire
Galaxy and across various metallicity ranges.
Key words. Galaxy: abundances. Galaxy: disk. Stars: abundances. Techniques: spectroscopic.
1. Introduction
With the massive collection of data by the Gaia satellite (Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2016, 2023), and the ground-based spec-
troscopic surveys, such as APOGEE (Majewski et al. 2017),
GALAH (De Silva et al. 2015), LAMOST (Deng et al. 2012),
andGaia -ESO (Gilmore et al. 2012), Galactic astronomy has
been significantly propelled forward. The extensiveness of these
datasets has enabled to build multi-dimensional maps of the
Milky Way which are used to decipher the timeline of events that
have shaped its history and evolution. In this framework, chem-
ical abundances of stars are powerful repositories of the compo-
⋆analysis of data taken as part of ESO programm ID 108.22DXsition of the birth cloud from which they originate (see e.g. Free-
man & Bland-Hawthorn 2002a; Matteucci 2012). The elements
studied through stellar spectra carry information of the nuclear
reactions and astrophysical processes which have modified the
evolution of the birth cloud’s chemical composition (Freeman
& Bland-Hawthorn 2002b; Hogg et al. 2016; Jofré et al. 2017;
Ratcli ffe et al. 2020), and thus are used to unveil the chemical en-
richment history of the hosting environment (Bovy et al. 2012;
Minchev et al. 2017; Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2019; Buder et al.
2021).
Among the multiple chemical abundance ratios, it has been
found that some specific combinations are particularly informa-
tive as they show strong correlations with age (e.g. da Silva et al.

2012; Nissen 2015; Spina et al. 2018; Nissen et al. 2020). These
chemical tracers, also dubbed as chemical clocks (Nissen 2015;
Tucci Maia et al. 2016), have been proposed as an alternative to
determine stellar ages.
Dating stars is of paramount importance as it provides crucial
insights into the timeline of several evolutionary processes, but
it is very di fficult to do despite the various existing techniques
(Noels & Bragaglia 2015). Consequently, the prospects of esti-
mated ages inferred from element abundances have been widely
explored, especially for single field stars for which the age deter-
mination is even more di fficult than for stars in groups or clusters
(Hayden et al. 2022; Leung et al. 2023; Anders et al. 2023).
Despite the valuable use of these chemical-age relations,
there are di fferent factors which can alter these tracers, threat-
ening their reliability and universality as age calibrators (Feltz-
ing et al. 2017; Casali et al. 2020). Indeed, a dependency with
metallicity has been found by Feltzing et al. (2017), Delgado
Mena et al. (2019), and Casali et al. (2020). Furthermore, al-
though the relations might not be a ffected by the stellar type
(Slumstrup et al. 2017), they could be a ffected by the techniques
used for age determination (Berger et al. 2022). The lack of ho-
mogeneity in these chemical clocks can be attributed to both the
diverse nucleosynthetic processes that take place during a star’s
lifetime and the intricate nature of chemical enrichment and star
formation histories (SFHs) which undergo significant changes
when examining a considerable spatial volume (Chiappini et al.
1997; Feuillet et al. 2018; Magrini et al. 2021; Casamiquela et al.
2021).
Another important aspect to be taken into account is that
stars move away from their birth places (see for example Sell-
wood & Binney 2002a; Minchev & Famaey 2010; Frankel et al.
2020). Radial gradients and chemical signatures can be signif-
icantly weakened by this stellar migration making it di fficult
to reproduce the expected chemical trends. This dependence
on galactocentric position and the impossibility of establishing
unique chemical-age trends across the Galaxy correlates with the
radial fluctuations in SFH, which in itself also creates a depen-
dence of the stellar yields on the metallicity of the considered
environment (Magrini et al. 2009; Casamiquela et al. 2021; Vis-
casillas Vázquez et al. 2022; Ratcli ffe et al. 2023b,a).
All these e ffects needed to be considered for establishing re-
liable chemical-age calibrations. To this purpose, it is indispens-
able to have high precision abundances to minimize the e ffects
of internal abundance determination errors and to disentangle
the di fferent processes which might play a role in altering the
relations. In addition, accurate ages determined from a separate
reliable method are needed for a solid study of this kind
Slumstrup et al. (2017) confirmed the tight correlation be-
tween [Y /Mg] and age discussed by Nissen (2015) for six
evolved stars at solar metallicity in four open clusters, extend-
ing the validity of the [Y /Mg] chemical clock from dwarfs to
red giants. A later study of the red giant ϵTau in the Hyades at
super-solar metallicity was found to fall just above the solar twin
relation (Arentoft et al. 2019). This suggests, that the chemical
clock for evolved stars could as well depend on [Fe /H] as so-
lar analogue stars (Feltzing et al. 2017). More recently, Berger
et al. (2022) demonstrated that [Y /Mg]-age relation behaves dif-
ferently for stars other than solar-twins. These evidences may
indicate that the picture of chemical tagging is more compli-
cated for giants than otherwise expected, e.g., poorly understood
mixing processes happening in their atmospheres might have an
impact on their abundances.
At the moment GALAH is the only large-scale spectroscopic
survey that provides yttrium (Y) abundances, but this is focusedon main-sequence and sub-giant stars. Hayden et al. (2022) used
GALAH data for main-sequence turn-o ffstars to show that a
precision of∼0.05 dex was not su fficient to calibrate di fferent
chemical clocks, even if ages were estimated with a precision of
1-2 Gyr (though see the recent work of Walsen et al. 2023, who
improved both, abundances and selection of stars).
Asteroseismology is currently one of the most precise ways
to determine ages for single field stars (Chaplin & Miglio 2013;
Chaplin et al. 2014), especially for red giant (RG) stars (Miglio
2012; Anders et al. 2023), which are bright enough for infer-
ring reliable age information. In synergy with the large-scale
spectroscopic surveys, asteroseismology has widely contributed
to spectroscopic age determination (Pinsonneault et al. 2014).
While asteroseismic ages for an abundance of stars have been
made available by the CoRoT (Valentini et al. 2016; Anders et al.
2017), Kepler (Gilliland et al. 2010; Pinsonneault et al. 2014)
and K2 (Howell et al. 2014; Rendle et al. 2019), they only sur-
veyed parts of the sky. With the launch of the TESS mission
(Sharma et al. 2018; Silva Aguirre et al. 2020), a larger part of
the sky has been surveyed, thus allowing for asteroseismic ages
to be used in wider studies.
In this work we use a sample of high-resolution UVES spec-
tra of RGB field stars with asteroseismic ages to explore the ho-
mogeneity and dependencies of chemical clocks accros metallic-
ity. With our homogeneous high resolution and signal-to-noise
spectra, we determine abundances and ages for more than sev-
enty giant stars. Our analysis serves to deepen the understanding
and usage of chemical clocks in the case of more evolved stars.
The paper is structured as follow. In Sect. 2 we introduce the
observational data used for this work and in Sect. 3 we explain
the methods we used for abundance and age determination. In
Sect. 4 we present our results for the relations between ages and
chemical abundance rations, and a discussion about their impli-
cations with a conclusion can be found in Sect. 5.
2. Data
2.1. Target selection
We have analyzed a sample of 74 red giant branch (RGB) stars
in five K2 fields, from which we extract their Epic identification
number, their corresponding Gaia DR3 ID, coordinates, magni-
tudes and seismic information, summarised in Table A.1. These
stars have been selected from the K2 targets already observed
by APOGEE DR17 (Abdurro’uf et al. 2022), from which an as-
sessment of the metallicity and temperature was available. This
allows us to infer the stellar ages with an error of ≤30% (av-
erage∼20%, see section 3.2 for a more detailed discussion).
The inferred ages are shown for all targets at the top of Fig. 1,
showcasing a significant range in both age and metallicity which
serves for the purpose of this study. Thanks to the Gaia third
data release (DR3) (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2023) the selection
focused on mostly bright disk giants located in the solar region
(29 stars with 8.5 <RGAL<9 kpc ), and the majority in the outer
disk (9 <RGAL<10 kpc).
At the bottom of Fig. 1 we show the Galactic positions of
our targets, coloured by their magnitude. In the left hand panel,
we plot the cartesian coordinates X and Y , and in the right hand
panel we plot the polar coordiantes R and z. We can see how
the stars are located at di fferent positions, and that toward the
outer disk, the stars are about 1 kpc above (or below) the Galactic
plane.

2.2. Spectral observations and data reduction
We followed up the selected APOGEE DR17 targets with
UVES, a cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph mounted on the
Very Large Telescope (VLT), at Paranal Observatory. The data
was observed under the ESO programe ID 108.22DX. The spec-
tra were taken between September 2021 and January 2022 and
the configuration employed ensures a resolving power of R∼
110000 covering a wavelength range from 480 to 680 nm. The
high quality of the spectra translates to a signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of∼80−100 estimated by the ESO pipeline, which is
also listed in Tab. A.1.
3. Method: stellar analysis
We adopted the automatic pipeline presented in the work of
Casamiquela et al. (2020) which relies on the public software
iSpec (Blanco-Cuaresma et al. 2014a; Blanco-Cuaresma 2019).
The workflow was personalized for our purpose to perform the
correction for the barycentric velocity and the stellar radial ve-
locity (RVs). The RVs were determined using a synthetic tem-
plate. The sky subtraction and the cleaning from telluric fea-
tures were applied using an internal telluric line list provided
byiSpec . Finally, we normalized the spectra in segments using
cubic splines and finding the continuum level with a median-
maximum filter. An example of a portion of a normalised and
velocity corrected spectrum is reported in Fig. 2.

3.1. Atmospheric parameters
The atmospheric parameters ( Teff, [M/H], [α/M] and broadening
parameters) were calculated via synthetic spectral fitting. This
technique produces synthetic spectra on the fly and compares
them with the observed spectrum taking into account the uncer-
tainties on its flux. The parameters are found by χ2minimization
between the flux and the synthesis. We chose Turbospectrum as
the radiative transfer code (Alvarez & Plez 1998; Plez 2012),
which considers local thermodynamic equilibrium and the one
dimensional spherical MARCS model atmospheres (Gustafsson
et al. 2008). The atomic parameters are contained in the latest
version (v.6) of the line list of the Gaia -ESO Survey (Heiter
et al. 2021) and the line selection to perform the fitting is taken
from Blanco-Cuaresma (2019). Lines a ffected by telluric fea-
tures, blends, or continuum displacement are automatically dis-
carded. It leads to a total of 202 lines for 21 elements.
Following Blanco-Cuaresma (2019), we initially performed
the synthesis fitting leaving e ffective temperature Teff, surface
gravity log g, metallicity [M /H], alpha-enhancement [ α/M] and
the microturbulence velocity vmicas free parameters. The reso-
lution was fitted for each spectrum for accounting for the broad-
ening e ffects, while the rotational velocity vsiniwas fixed to 1.6
kms−1as we expected a rotation velocity less than 2 kms−1for
giant stars. By visual inspection we checked the goodness of the
fits. We removed the spectrum with low SNR ( ∼30) of the star
EPIC 201456500, due to unsatisfactory results obtained from the
fit compared to the rest of the 73 targets, with SNR ∼70−100.
All targets have seismic measurements, thus making it pos-
sible to validate our results with those obtained considering the
seismic information. To do so, for a second run of spectral fitting,
we adopted the scaling relation from astroseismology (Brown
et al. 1991; Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995) that involves the fre-
quenct of maximum power νmaxfrom the K2 catalogue to infer

where we as Heiter et al. (2015) adopt the solar values νmax⊙=
3100µHz,Teff⊙=5777 K, and log g⊙=4.44 dex. To achieve
this, we used the temperatures determined in the previous run.
We proceeded to compute log gvalues using the provided equa-
tion. This independent determination of log genables us a fur-

ther validation of internal consistency between our parameters
and the ones that can be derived from astroseismology.
The relation in equation 1 is extrapolated from the Sun. Since
we apply it here for giants, deviations should be expected, which
have been quantified in the literature, e.g. with studies of binary
systems, parallaxes and comparisons to interferometry. Astero-
seismic masses have been shown to be accurate to better than
8% (Stello et al. 2016; Miglio et al. 2016; Brogaard et al. 2016)
and radius better than 4% (Silva Aguirre et al. 2012; Huber et al.
2016; Sahlholdt & Silva Aguirre 2018). Assuming a stellar mass
of 1.2 solar masses and radius of 10 R ⊙, this translates to an ac-
curacy on log gbetter than 0.04 dex.
A comparison of the spectroscopic and asteroseismic log g
results appears in Fig. 3. The stars are sorted according to
their temperature, and coloured according to their metallicity.
For most of the stars the agreement between both determina-
tions is within 0.2 dex, with few exceptions which di ffer more.
These uncertainties might stem both from increased variability in
sigma onνmax, and ∆νas presented by the two lower subplots of
Fig. 3 and from the larger errors on the temperatures of warmer
giants (as shown at the bottom left of Fig. 4). Concerning the
two coldest outliers, the log gvalues computed with the seismic
relation exceed the spectroscopic values by more than 0.2 dex.
Despite conducting a visual inspection, no issues were identified
in their fits. Consequently, we have opted not to exclude these
cases. However, in light of these findings, caution must be taken
when interpreting the results for these three giants, given that
accuracy may be compromised for such cold stars.
We then derived again the other atmospheric parameters fix-
ing the asteroseismic log giteratively to ensure consistent param-
eters. Our final parameters thus are those which combine both
spectroscopic temperatures and metallicities with seismic log g.
These appear in the Kiel diagram in the upper panel of Fig. 4.

It is possible to notice the extension of the metallicity range
covered by the sample, i.e. -0.7 ≲[M/H]≲+0.1. The two coolest
stars are the most metal-poor ones. iSpec estimates the uncer-
tainties for the atmospheric parameters from the covariance ma-
trix (the square root of the diagonal elements) computed by the
least square algorithm, and they are plotted at the bottom of
Fig. 4. For the temperature the average uncertainty is 21 K and
the relative uncertainties increase for hotter temperatures as well
as for lower SNR. The seismic log g, however, remains unaf-
fected by such trends, even with a temperature change of 21 K,
resulting in a variation of approximately 0.001 dex. For the spec-
troscopic log gthe average value of the relative uncertainty is
∼0.02 with a spread around 0.01, but no evident trend is present
looking at the right panel at the bottom of Fig. 4.
Since the stars were targeted as a follow up from APOGEE
observations, it is natural to compare our results with those ob-
tained from APOGEE DR17. A comparison for temperature, sur-
face gravity and metallicity is illustrated in in Fig. 5. The di ffer-
ences (APOGEE-ours) are plotted in three di fferent panels start-
ing from the spectroscopic temperature at the top, the seismic
gravity in the middle and the metallicity at the bottom.
In addition, in the same plot we show the distribution of
the di fferences of all three parameters, with the corresponding
mean and standard deviation indicated in each panel. It is pos-
sible to see that the parameters are generally consistent for the
two methods exhibiting larger deviations in the cases of the most
metal-poor and most metal-rich and hotter stars. Given that these
parameters are correlated, the scatter for the hotter giants can
be attributed to the increase of the errors with the temperature.
However, for the temperatures and log gthe mean di fferences
reported in the histograms are within the average parameter un-
certainties. For the global metallicity [M /H] there is an o ffset
of around 0.05 dex which exceeds the average combined uncer-

offset, together with the scatters found, can be explained by the
differences in methodologies, analysis and calibrations (see .e.g
Jofré et al. 2019; Jönsson et al. 2020; Heged˝ us et al. 2023, for
extensive discussions).
3.2. Age determination
All stars in this study are in the giant phase of their evolution.
Therefore, we expect them to be low and intermediate mass stars
undergoing H-shell burning. Since they are typically bright, this
category is a perfect benchmark for studying the ages of field
stars located at di fferent distances from the Sun using asteroseis-
mology. To this purpose, we used the public BAyesian STellar
Algorithm ( BASTA , Silva Aguirre et al. 2015; Aguirre Børsen-
Koch et al. 2022). It is a python-based code which infers stellar
properties by matching observations to grids of stellar models.
In our case, we employed the updated isochrones from a Bag
of Stellar Tracks and Isochrones (BaSTI, Hidalgo et al. 2018;
Pietrinferni et al. 2021).
As observables, we used the Teffand [Fe /H] derived by our
spectral analysis, and the large frequency separation ∆νand fre-
quency of maximum power νmaxfrom the K2 catalogue listed in
Tab. A.1. Additionally, we used the magnitudes J,HandKfrom
2MASS (Cutri et al. 2003) together with the parallaxes from
Gaia DR3 to match to the synthetic magnitudes of the stellar

and log gfor the entire sample.
We matched the observations to the set of BaSTI isochrones
computed with core overshooting, atomic di ffusion and mass
loss enabled (case 4 in table 1 of Aguirre Børsen-Koch et al.
2022) deemed appropriate for this sample following Stokholm
et al. (2023). Our results of ages can be checked for consis-
tency by comparing the best BASTA parameters with the spec-
troscopic ones, which is plotted in Fig. 6. We can see good agree-
ment having a mean di fference of 46 K with a dispersion of 40
K for the temperature, and a 0.02 average di fference with 0.09 in
dispersion for log g.
3.3. Chemical abundances
We measured chemical abundances for the following families of
elements:α-capture (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti); odd-Z (Na, Al, Sc, Cu,
V); iron-peak (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn); neutron-capture (slow-
processed : Sr, Y , Zr, La, Ce, Nd; rapid-process: Eu). We fixed
the atmospheric parameters calculated as explained in Sect. 3.1.
We proceeded with specral synthesis adopting the same radia-
tive code and atmospheric model as for the stellar parameters.
We determined the mean abundances ratios ⟨hX
Fei
⟩using the line-
by-line absolute abundances of each element. To be able to com-
pare the chemical relations with the literature (see section 4.3),
we expressed the bracket abundances with respect to the Sun by
adding the absolutehX
Yi
⊙ratios calculated from a solar HARPS
spectrum which we took from the library of Blanco-Cuaresma
et al. (2014b). The HARPS spectrum has a similar resolution to
our UVES sample (R ∼110000).
We customized the line selection according to the number
of lines per element: when dealing with a substantial number of
measurable lines, we discarded the lines that exhibited system-
atically di fferent results. Conversely, for the elements with 1 or
2 lines (Al, Cu, Zn, Sr, Ce, Eu), we relied on the quality flags
synflag (for the blending properties) and gf_flag introduced by
Heiter et al. (2021). The first flag refers to the blending proper-
ties of a line, meanwhile the second indicates the quality of the
logg fvalue of the line. This meant that we excluded lines with
potentially inaccurate log g fmeasurements from our analysis.
It is worth to stress that our analysis is done in LTE. It has
been demonstrated that for the solar metallicity range non-LTE
effects have small impact on the computation of abundances (e.g

Amarsi et al. 2020a,b; Liu et al. 2020) with respect more metal-
poor companions. Nevertheless, recent works by Alexeeva et al.
(2023a); Storm & Bergemann (2023) examined the impact on
NLTE for classical elements used as chemical clocks, such as yt-
trium. They demonstrated that the for late type stars, the correc-
tions concerning Y II lines do not exceed ≈0.12-0.15 dex close
to solar metallicity. The deviations can be more severe for metal-
poor red giants, and they exceed 0.5 dex only for [Fe /H]<-3.0,
a metallicity range that falls out the coverage of our sample.
Furthermore, it is important to consider that the number of
suitable lines for abundance determination can considerably dif-
fer from one element to the other. Elements with fewer lines
(e.g. Mg I, Sr I, Zr II) may be more susceptible to the influence
of atomic or molecular data uncertainties and blends due to the
lower statistics of the measurements. All these e ffects systemati-
cally contribute to the overall uncertainty in the determination of
abundance ratios, and separating these e ffects can be challeng-
ing.
We decided to compute the uncertainties of the abundance
ratios by perturbing the spectra within their flux errors and by re-
peating the entire analysis (the synthetic spectral fitting both for
the atmospheric parameters and the abundances) ten times. By
taking the mean and the standard deviation of these "repeated"
measurements, we inferred the average dispersion of our abun-
dance measurements as a response of the SNR of our spectra.
We note this represents an internal precision of our abundances,
and not a measurement of their accuracy. For the purpose of this
paper, which is to test the relations of these abundances with
ages as a function of metallicity, we are more interested in the
relative di fference among our measurements and thus we aim to
reach high precision. For all the elements the internal precision
is around 0.01-0.02 dex, with a maximum of 0.04 dex for stron-
tium and zirconium.
Complete tables providing the atmospheric parameters, the
line selection and the mean abundance ratios with their associ-
ated uncertainties are available as online material.

4. Results
4.1. Age-metallicity relation
Figure 7 depicts the distribution of the resulting ages on the up-
per panel, and the age-metallicity relation (AMR) on the lower
panel. Our sample hence covers ages of the entire range of cos-
mic history, from very young to very old stars. The range in
metallicity is also significant, allowing us to have an AMR to
study the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. Similar to previ-
ous studies (e.g., Silva Aguirre et al. 2018; Feuillet et al. 2019),
the AMR of our stars shows no correlation, thought we lack
young stars at low metallicity. Nevertheless, the scatter is very
large, in fact much larger than the uncertainties. This underscores
the complexity and dynamics of our Galaxy, implying that rely-
ing solely on this relationship is insu fficient for constraining the
formation and the chemical evolution of the Milky Way.
Despite the improved precision in our abundances and ac-
curacy in our ages, with this sample we are not able to see the
dual age-metallicity relation recently discussed by Nissen et al.
(2020), Jofré (2021) and Sahlholdt et al. (2022). This might be
due to the fact that our stars span a wide range of Galactic vol-
ume, as well as metallicities.
In Fig. 7 it is possible to see that six stars show non-physical
ages, i.e. >14 Gyr. This group includes one of the two most
metal-poor and cooler stars within the sample. For the entire
group we checked the values of their αabundances (using Mg,
Ca, Si and Ti) finding [ α/Fe]>0.3. We attempted to utilize
isochrones with αenhancement for this sub-sample, but the re-
sults did not improve significantly. We thus decided to not con-
sider these stars in the analysis, reducing the sample from 72 to
66 stars. The challenge of age calculation is evident from Fig.8,
displaying the relative uncertainties, which extend up to 40 %
and a mean uncertainty of ∼10%.
4.2. Abundance-age trends
For two stars we measured very high abundances of all s-process
elements, hinting towards a pollution from an asymptotic-giant-
branch (AGB) star. The abundances thus cannot be used for
studying the chemical evolution of the Galaxy and were removed
from our analysis. The study of their binary nature will be pub-

lished in a complementary paper. This cut reduced the sample to
64 stars.
In Fig. 9 we show the abundance ratios as a function of stellar
age for the stars of our sample that had reliable ages and no signs
of binarity. Each panel shows a di fferent element. We note that
most metal-poor and old stars are enhanced in the αelements
(Mg, Si, Ca, Ti). In fact, there is a general increasing trend of
[α/Fe] with stellar ages. This can be seen as the result of chem-
ical evolution which is considerably shaped by the yields of SN
type II and SN type Ia (hereafter SN II and SN Ia, respectively)
occurring on di fferent timescales(Matteucci 2016).
Our trends agree with previous chemo-chronological studies
conducted on solar-like stars (Delgado Mena et al. 2019; Nis-
sen et al. 2020; da Silva et al. 2012) where calcium exhibits a
less pronounced correlation while Na abundances lie on a op-
posite and spread trend. Referring to the models presented by
Kobayashi et al. (2020) for sodium (Na), the trend within a com-
parable metallicity range to ours does not exhibit significant dif-
ferences. Additionally, it is important to remember that Na abun-
dances are heavily influenced by NLTE e ffects (Andrievsky et al.
2007), which we are not taking into account in this study. Plus,
as we are studying giants, which have likely undergone mixing
processes. These factors can potentially blur our chemical-age
relation. In the case of calcium (Ca), this observation may be
partially attributed to the contribution of SN Ia in its production
(Kobayashi et al. 2020). Silicon (Si) displays a slightly weak
increasing trend with age, which is in agreement with Delgado
Mena et al. (2019) and Nissen et al. (2020) but conflicting with
the results reported by da Silva et al. (2012), who reported no
discernible trend.

represent the observed spectra, the orange color denotes the synthetic
fit and the yellow color the area in which the abundances are computed.
The values of the equivalent widths of each line are reported in each
panel.
Generally the behaviour of the αelements is opposite to the
one of the s-process elements, which have a lower ratio with re-
spect to iron for older stars. There is no noticeable di fference
between the lighter strontium (Sr), yttrium (Y) and heavier zir-
conium (Zr), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce) n-capture elements,
apart from a slightly flatter trend of La for younger stars. As
in Delgado Mena et al. (2019); da Silva et al. (2012) the s-
processed element neodymium (Nd) creates a flatter trend es-
pecially for older stars, while its production seems to increase at
more recent times.
Concerning the r-process element europium (Eu), the ob-
served scatter can be attributed to the challenges in measuring
its abundances. Our measurements were limited to only one line
(λ664.5101 nm), located in the reddest part of the spectrum. An
example of the Eu line profile for J04034842 +1551272 can be
seen in the right hand panel of Fig. 10. Nonetheless, the enhance-
ment for the oldest giants agrees with the expected increasing of

Barium (Ba) is a good representative element for the s-
process family and the abundance of barium was measured for
the entire sample. However, we have opted not to report our
results. The two Ba II lines used in our analysis (585.366 and
614.141 nm, which are also shown in Fig. 10) require careful
assessment. These lines are known to have a strong correlation
with stellar activity (Reddy & Lambert 2017). Furthermore, the
intensity of the lines identified in our sample of giants raised
concerns about entering a regime influenced by saturation and
NLTE e ffects (Liu et al. 2020; Baratella et al. 2021). Indeed, for
the star J04034842 +1551272 plotted in Fig. 10, the Ba lines are
saturated.
Regarding the iron-peak elements, as in other studies, we
did not find any specific correlations. Cobalt (Co) and nickel
(Ni) show an increasing trend for stars younger than the Sun
with the oldest experiencing a flattening trend. Chromium (Cr)
and manganese (Mn) exhibit more dispersed trends, possibly
indicating the influence of AGB stars in their formation pro-
cesses.(Kobayashi et al. 2020).
Finally, among the odd-Z element, aluminium (Al) shows a
strong increasing trend with age, which makes this explosive el-
ement a valuable component for chemical tagging (Jofré et al.
2020; Casamiquela et al. 2021; Hawkins et al. 2015; Das et al.
2020). A similar strong trend can be seen for vanadium (V),
which is mostly produced by core-collapse supernovae (CC-
SNe) (Ou et al. 2020) with a smaller contribution from SN Ia
(Kobayashi et al. 2020). Scandium (Sc), present a moderately
smaller decrease over time, but a trend is still visible, being
mostly produced by CCSNe. Copper (Cu) is a more complex
case, lacking a clear trend with time, being partially formed from
AGB stars, while models for Sc attributed its formation to SN Ia
(Kobayashi et al. 2020).
4.3. Comparison with established chemical clocks
To validate our chemical abundance measurements, we consider
the well-studied chemical clocks, which relate [Y /Mg] (for in-
stance, da Silva et al. 2012; Nissen 2015), [Y /Al] (e.g., Nissen
2016; Spina et al. 2016, 2018; Casamiquela et al. 2021) and age.
In the case of Y and magnesium (Mg), these two abundances are
representative of the families of the n-capture and αelements.
Since these two groups of elements are produced through various
production channels which operate on di fferent time-scales, their
dependencies with time can be seen as a direct consequence of
the chemical evolution within our Galaxy. In fact Mg, like other
α-elements, primarily originates from CCSNe, and it contributed
to the enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM) on earlier
and shorter time-scales. On the other hand, Y is an s-processed
element that comes from low and intermediate-mass stars (1-8
M⊙) during their AGB phase. These stars release their elemen-
tal yields over significantly longer time intervals (for extensive

solid lines represent the relation identified for the three distinct metal-
licity groups outlined in Tab1. The grey and light blue shaded regions
display the previously established relationships from the literature de-
rived for solar-twin stars which we compare with the findings for our
solar group (in blue). The figure’s legends provide the slopes of each re-
lation along with their associated uncertainties. The two giants marked
with star symbols are two possible evolved blue stragglers which have
been excluded from the fitting procedures, as discussed in section 4.3.
explanations see e.g., Kobayashi et al. 2006; Matteucci 2012;
Karakas & Lattanzio 2014 and references therein). Therefore,
the ratios of these element abundances enclose intrinsic galactic
time information and can be used as age indicators.
The primary sources of Al are CCSNe (Bisterzo et al. 2014;
Fujimoto et al. 2020). As stated before, these stars act on signif-
icantly shorter timescales compared to AGBs, which are primar-
ily responsible for the production of neutron-capture elements.
For Y and Mg we compare our results with the relations dis-
cussed by Nissen et al. (2017) and by Berger et al. (2022). These
relations are based on solar-twin data and were derived in LTE.
Ages were calculated with isochrones in Berger et al. (2022),
and using asteroseismic data in Nissen et al. (2017).
To best compare these results with our own, we consider
only the stars with measured metallicities around solar ( −0.1<
[Fe/H]<0.1). We call that group of stars solar for better ref-
erence and will be represented in blue color throughout the rest
Article number, page 8 of 19S. Vitali et al.: Exploring the dependence of chemical traits on metallicity
of the work. Since our sample covers a wider range in [Fe /H],
to study the dependency on metallicity, we divide our sample
in more bins, namely, one of intermediate metallicity ( −0.35<
[Fe/H]<−0.1), and one metal poor ([Fe /H]<−0.35). We call
the stars belonging to these divisions mix andpoor . The stars
from these groups are plotted in yellow and red, respectively, and
their ranges and number of stars can be found in Tab. 1 toghether
with the solar group.
The abundance-age linear relations were estimated using the
RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus, e.g. Fischler & Bolles
1981) algorithm for linear regression. RANSAC estimates slope
and intercept using repeated random sub-sampling to reduce the
influence of highly uncertain measurements (or outliers) on the
estimated relations. To account for the uncertainties in the data,
we perform this regression multiple times, using values from
normal distributions for each abundance and age measurement.
These distributions are centered around the reported measure-
ments (see results in Tab. A.2) and have standard deviations
based on their reported uncertainties. We fit 1000 regressors by
sampling abundances and ages in accordance with their uncer-
tainties. The final values of the linear regression coe fficients and
their uncertainties are computed by determining the mean and
variance after these iterations.
In the top panel of Fig. 11 we present the linear relations
we fit for the three metallicity groups. The colored shaded areas
denote the literature fits along including their respective uncer-
tainties. Grey color represents the relation discovered by Nis-
sen et al. (2017) while the blue shade represents the relation of
Berger et al. (2022). Comparing our solar results with the lit-
erature, we find an agreement with the relations found in the
literature for solar metallicity stars. Indeed, our relation is also
consistent with other studies that consider red giant branch stars
(Slumstrup et al. 2017; Casamiquela et al. 2020).
The bottom of Fig. 11 shows the same metallicity groups for
the [Y /Al] ratio. Here the comparison is performed with respect
to the works by Nissen (2016); Spina et al. (2018) that again
analyse solar-twin stars and ages from isochrone models, assum-
ing LTE. The slope found in this work for the solar group fall
within the established literature ranges. A slight deviation is no-
ticeable for very young ages, potentially caused by the observed
dispersion among younger stars. Additionally, we are comparing
our giants with less evolved stars, specifically solar-twin stars.
Despite this, the comparison aligns with the findings in the liter-
ature, accounting for uncertainties.
Similarly to the solar metallicity range, we perform linear
regression for the mixandpoor groups. The fits are plotted with
a continuous line whose slope is indicated in the legend. We find
for both cases that the chemical-age relation becomes flatter with
metallicity, which agrees with previous findings (e.g., Feltzing
et al. 2017; Delgado Mena et al. 2019; Casali et al. 2020; Berger
et al. 2022).
We comment on the stars J16081431-2130041,
J03573726 +2425332 (marked with blue and yellow star
symbols), which have noticeably lower [Y /Mg] and [Y /Al]
given their age. By visual inspection of their spectra, we were
unable to find anything particular that would make us conclude
that the chemical abundances were wrongly determined. The
target with a blue star symbol is associated with a relatively
large abundance error bar, nevertheless this discrepancy does
not account for the low abundance ratio. We further inspect
the results of the ages, reaching the same conclusion that the
results seem to be well behaved. We believe these stars might
be evolved blue stragglers. Recent studies have shown that such
stars have indeed very normal chemical abundance patterns andmight not necessarily be binaries anymore (Jofré et al. 2023),
but can still be explained with the merger of two stars (Izzard
et al. 2018), henceforth being evolved blue stragglers. In the
field, stars can have a wide range of ages, blue stragglers tend
to be very hidden, as they do not necessarily show oddly young
ages, such as blue straggles in clusters (Sandage 1953), blue
metal-poor stars in the halo (Preston & Sneden 2000) or the stars
dubbed as young αrich stars (Martig et al. 2015). Chemical
clocks might o ffer an interesting way to identify them, because
their chemistry predicts an older age than what can be measured
with standard evolutionary tracks that consider single stars.
4.4. Dependency of metallicity in chemical traits
Jofré et al. (2020) discussed how many other abundance ratios
which combine an s-process element with an α-capture element
also show a strong dependency with age. They called these abun-
dance ratios chemical traits instead of chemical clocks, arguing
that a clock has a universal dependency on time, which might
not be the case of these abundance ratios. That work focused on
a solar-twin sample, thus it remains to be explored if they all
had a similar dependency on metallicity than the more studied
[Y/Mg] discussed in the previous section (see also Feltzing et al.
2017 and Nissen et al. 2020 for discussion). Delgado Mena et al.
(2017) explored for a set of FGK dwarf stars, examining vari-
ous combinations of elements alongside some [s /α] ratios. Their
study revealed as well variability in abundance-age relationships
influenced by factors such as metallicity, stellar structure, and
evolution.
Here we have a larger range of metallicity and we can in-
vestigate the dependency on these chemical traits with metallic-
ity. To do so, we keep the separation of the 3 metallicity groups
listed in Tab. 1 and plot the abundance ratios as a function of age
in Fig. 12, where we respect the color scheme of Fig. 11. Each
panel shows a di fferent trait. Each column is a di fferentα-capture
element (Mg, Si, Ca and Ti) and each row a di fferent s-process
element (Sr, Y , Zr, La, Ce and Nd). Following the analysis dis-
cussed in the previous section, we perform linear regression fits
to the data and plot with the corresponding colour a continuous
line in Fig. 12. From this point of the analysis we exclude the
two possible blue stragglers discussed above. A table reporting
the linear regression fit coe fficients for the three groups can be
found in the Appendix, A.2.
In general, we see that the chemical traits have a negative
trend with age, following the same behavior as [Y /Mg], namely
that the neutron-capture element over Fe increases with time
while theα-capture element over Fe decreases. We further find
that the solar group, which is coloured with blue, has traits with
stronger correlations than the poor group, which is coloured
with red. The mix group lies in between. Looking at the solar
group, Zr, Sr and then Y combined with alphas show the steeper
slopes. These combinations usually show the higher correlation
(as found as well by Jofré et al. 2020 and Casamiquela et al.
2021), which we quantified by computing for each regression fit
the Pearson correlation coe fficient (ρcoefficient) reported in ta-
ble A.2. The ratios involving Ca in the denominator for Nd, Ce,
La and Y do not satisfy the criterion of having a slope greater
than a threshold value set at 0.03 dex Gyr−1. This can be partially
attributed to the contribution of SN Ia in the formation processes
of Ca, resulting in a less pronounced correlation with age com-
pared to the other α-elements. The threshold value for the slope
is adopted following the same criterion as in Jofré et al. (2020).
They derived this criterion from typical observations of the slope

remain below 0.03 dex Gyr−1.
It is interesting to notice that [La /α-elements] ratios drive
the slopes to be smaller than 0.03 dex Gyr−1. However, our coef-
ficients considering their uncertainties are comparable with the
results found by Jofré et al. (2020). In this same literature work
Ca does not produce considerable strong correlations with age,except when it is considered alongside Ba, an element we have

slopes as expected from the scatter shown by this element in the

Age [Gyr]Abundance ratio

reveals an interesting behaviour for these elements, which ex-
hibit a strong and neat correlation with ages. This characteristic
makes them noteworthy candidates for chemical stellar age pre-
diction.
Even if it is not clear which kind of sources are responsi-
ble for the production of r-process elements (for instance neu-
tron star mergers, magneto-rotational supernovae, see for further
details Côté et al. 2018), they constitute the main channel for
n-capture nucleosynthesis before the upturn of the AGBs, after
ignition of helium shell burning. Therefore, the [s /r] ratios are
promising indicators of the contribution of intermediate-mass
stars compared to high-mass star, and thus valuable tracers of
chemical evolution (e.g. Magrini et al. 2018; Recio-Blanco et al.
2021).
Our results for these element are shown in the left-hand col-
umn of Fig. 13 for the [s /r] abundance ratios, [s /V] in the middle
column, and in the right-hand column for the [s /Al] ratio. The
rows are sorted in the same way as Fig. 12. Similar to the α-
captures, the traits when considering aluminium have a depen-
dency with metallicity such that the solar group yields a linear
regression fit with age that has a steeper slope than the poor
group, with the mixgroup in between. This is because Al is also
produced in CCSNe, at rates that are comparable to α-capture
elements. Also for this case, Zr is one of the elements that shows
stronger slopes, followed by Y and Sr. La and Ce, while showing
slightly weaker correlations, still have ratios with Al that are re-
lated with ages with slopes greater than the threshold value. The
trends observed in the other odd-Z element V display a compa-rable pattern, albeit with slightly less pronounced slopes. This
behaviour can be linked to the involvement of SNIa in the pro-
duction of V , in contrast to Al, which is predominantly formed
from CCSNe. Again, Zr and Sr exhibit stronger correlations with
steeper ratios together with La, while Ce and Nd showcase more
moderate trends as for the [n-capture /α]-elements.
The [s /r] abundance ratios have di fferent dependency with
age and metallicity, meaning that the stars in the solar group
do not necessarily display the stronger dependencies with ages.
In fact, it is the mixed group for which we observe the steep-
est slopes when examining the relationship with age. The only
exceptions are [Zr /Eu] and [Al /Eu]. These ratios yield a corre-
lation with age that is consistent with the s-process /α-capture
traits, namely stronger for the solar group. For the other traits,
the trends are negative, but with comparable trends with age. It
is important to bear in mind that the measure of Eu abundances
must be approached with caution since they are based on one
line, see explanation in section 4.2.
Finally, the scatter of the older and more metal-poor targets
which blur the age relations can be be ascribed to the challenges
in estimating ages, particularly for giants, resulting in greater
imprecision. This makes it more di fficult to separate the pure
[Fe/H]-dependency from the dispersion due to the age variable.
4.5. Comparing slopes
Generally, from Fig. 12 and 13 we find that all chemical traits
have a similar dependency with metallicity, namely that the
strongest dependency is for solar-metallicity stars, and it weak-
ens towards more metal-poor stars. The exception is when study-
ing only neutron capture elements and the [s /r] abundance ratio,
which seems to be more independent of metallicity.
In Fig. 14 we summarize these findings by studying further
the change of the slope for each trait. We plot the di fference in
slope of our linear regression fits for each group. The circles
represent the di fference in slope between the solar and the mix
group, while the star symbol represents the di fference between
thesolar and the poor group . The symbols are color coded
by theρcorrelation parameter of the linear regression fit found
for the poor group (star symbol) and mixgroup (dot marker).
The error bars incorporate the combined uncertainties of the dif-
ferences between the ratios. The top panel of the figure summa-
rizes the di fferences for the traits shown in Fig. 12 and the bottom
panel summarizes the di fferences for the traits of Fig. 13.
From this figure we immediately see that Zr is the element
with the strongest dependency on metallicity, followed by Y and
Sr. The di fferences in slope for the correlations of [Zr /α-capture]
and [Zr /Al] are up to 0.05 dex, twice as high as any other el-
ement, while the di fferences for Sr and Y are lower than 0.03
dex. Similar findings are reported by Magrini et al. (2018) and
Delgado Mena et al. (2017), who have unveiled a pronounced
[Zr/Fe] vs. [Fe /H] trend. We note however there is a high in-
trinsic scatter in these relations, potentially resulting from mea-
surements based on a single absorption line for both Zr and Al,
suggesting caution in adopting these elements as possible stel-
lar chemical-clocks. We further see that the traits that involve La
and Ce have a small dependency with metallicity, e.g. the ∆slope
values are close to zero, hence more universal stellar chemical-
clock.
The di fferent metallicity dependence discussed above could
be associated with the diverse origins and formation pathways
of both light ( ls) and heavy ( hs) s-process elements, also known
as first-peak (Sr, Y , Zr) and second-peak elements (Ba, La, Ce,
Pr, and Nd) respectively. The ls-elements in addition to the sig-

nificant contributions from the s-process channel (65% for Zr
and 69% for Y , Travaglio et al. 2004), exhibit notable contri-
butions from intermediate-mass AGB stars (Kobayashi et al.
2020; Goswami et al. 2023) and more massive star (Pignatari
et al. 2010). On the other hand, the primary sources responsi-
ble for these heavy s-process elements are the yields from low-
mass AGB stars with masses of ≤3M⊙(Lugaro et al. 2003).
For both groups, the complex production chain of s-process ele-
ments happening in the thermally-pulsing phase of AGB stars in
the burning-shell regions highly depends on metallicity (Bisterzo
et al. 2014; Karakas & Lattanzio 2014; Cristallo et al. 2015; Ma-
grini et al. 2021). This significantly challenges the uniformity of
these ratios in conveying age-related information.
Another notable di fference between the first and second-peak
elements is the percentage of s-process contribution and the neu-
tron flux within their respective sources. For the second-peak el-
ements, both the s-process contribution and neutron flux are high
(Travaglio et al. 2004; Karakas & Lugaro 2016). Earlier studies
have demonstrated that the decline in metallicity has a greater
impact on elements from the first peak compared to those from
the second peak. This is because the neutron flux rises as metal-
licity decreases, meaning that first peak elements are expected
to be more abundant at higher metallicity (Gallino et al. 2006;
Cristallo et al. 2015). Consequently, it is plausible that within
the range of metallicities being studied, the production mecha-
nisms of ls-elements may undergo alterations.
In this context, the study of Spina et al. (2018) demonstrated
that the slopes of [X /Fe]–age relationships exhibit an increase
with the s-process contribution, that is elements such as Zr, Y ,
and Sr present higher values of slopes, i.e. steeper, with only
barium displaying even greater values. In their work, the hs-
elements, La and Ce exhibit less steep slopes compared to the ls-
companions (as found in our analysis) even when their s-process
contributions are similar.
Moving to Nd, one of the heaviest element, we observe rela-
tively weak correlations with age. Its production pathway shows
resemblances to Ce, primarily originating from low-mass AGBs
(Lugaro et al. 2003). Consequently, one might anticipate strong
age correlations when Nd is examined in conjunction with α-
elements, similar to Ce. Referring to Bisterzo et al. (2014) the
s-contribution of Nd is ≈58%, while for Ce is ≈84%. Thesedifferent contributions might justify the di fferent age trends de-
tected for the two elements.
Regarding the behavior of the α-capture elements, there are
not any prominent features that emerge. We can see that when Ca
is considered the di fference in slope is slightly smaller. Indeed,
the [Y /Mg] trait has a stronger dependency with metallicity than
its equivalent [Y /Ca]. As mentioned in Sect. 4.4 this may origi-
nate from the yields of SN Ia, which contribute to the release of
calcium (Zenati et al. 2023).
Regarding the behavior of the r-process element Eu, we see
that in general the dependency on metallicity is very small, and
that the slopes are flatter compared to the ratios with the same
n-capture elements but with αor odd-Z elements in the numera-
tors. Similar conclusions are reported in the work of Spina et al.
(2018); Delgado Mena et al. (2019). We find that most traits have
negligible di fferences in the slope of the regression fits, except
[Zr/Eu], but we have already found that Zr might be driving the
metallicity dependency. The distinct behaviours of these element
ratios which result in more shallow slopes can be attributed to
the debated origin of r-processed elements. Apart from CCSNe,
more exotic scenarios have been proposed as potential sources
for r-processed elements, including neutron star mergers (Côté
et al. 2018).
The odd-Z elements V and Al, when combined with neutron-
capture elements, once again exhibit stronger correlations with
age within the solar metallicity group. However, there is a notice-
able flattening trend in the cases of Y , Zr, and La when they are
combined with vanadium for the metal-poor stars. Overall, Al
appears to have a lesser e ffect on flattening the age-metallicity
relationships for lower metallicities. For both odd-Z elements,
their dependence on metallicity, when considering the same spe-
cific n-capture, is more significant than that of Eu and it is more
similar to the α-elements.
Finally, we focus on the correlation coe fficient. The traits
with the tighter correlation for both mixandpoor are [Ce /Ca],
[Ce/Al] and [Ce /Ti], which interestingly have a very small de-
pendency with metallicity. Generally, the [Ce /α] ratios show this
small dependence, with the majority having slopes around 0.03
dex Gyr−1. The study conducted by Jofré et al. (2020) yielded
comparable values, finding an equivalent slope to ours concern-
ing [Ce /Si], along with a minor variation of 0.007 dex Gyr−1 for
[Ce/Mg].
Article number, page 12 of 19S. Vitali et al.: Exploring the dependence of chemical traits on metallicity
The traits that involve Zr, which have the highest metallic-
ity dependency, have quite weak correlation factor for the most
metal-poor group. It is thus possible that our Zr measurements
are simply very uncertain at low [Fe /H]. A similar e ffect might
be causing the poor correlation found for Nd. We know that Nd
lines are strong and heavily a ffected by hyperfine structure split-
ting, causing a large line-to-line scatter in abundance measure-
ments (Casamiquela et al. 2020). It is interesting that the clas-
sical [Y /Mg] trait is not the element with the strongest correla-
tion coe fficient, or the least dependency in metallicity. Indeed,
the trait that is the best candidate for chemical clock seems to
be [Ce /Ca], followed by [Ce /Al] (see Fig. 12 and 13 respec-
tively) because of their strength of the slope and weak metallic-
ity dependency. Another ratio displaying similar characteristics
is [Ce /Eu], even tough from Fig. 13 we can see that its overall
trend with age is very flat, thus not making this element ratio
vary much with time. Sales-Silva et al. (2022) tested the [Ce /α]
ratios as stellar chemical clocks by examining the evolution of
Ce in 42 open clusters. Their conclusion suggests that these ra-
tios exhibit variability across the disk owing to the influence of
AGB yields, which are dependent on metallicity. It needs how-
ever to be remarked that the clusters analyzed in their study en-
compass a wider Galactic radius (6 ≲RGC≲20 kpc) compared
to our work. At the same time, their analysis revealed a com-
parable age-dependence pattern within two distinct metallicity
groups (namely -0.6 <[Fe/H]<-0.1 and -0.1 <[Fe/H]< +0.4),
which is a similar behaviour observed in our relations. The study
on 47 open clusters conducted by Casamiquela et al. (2021)
also revealed an increasing scatter in the age-abundance rela-
tions across various radii outside the solar neighborhood ( d>1
kpc), demonstrating a dependency on the spatial volume anal-
ysed. However, they did not consider in particular ratios involv-
ing Ce.
Accounting for all the astrophysical explanations, deriving
robust conclusions solely based on pure metallicity dependence
becomes challenging due to the dispersion in abundance-age
trends. Factors beyond chemical evolution arguments can signifi-
cantly impact these relations, and complicate the comprehension
of our chemical trends. These variables might include uncertain-
ties associated with determining atmospheric parameters (partly
due to the level of the SNR of the measurements), inaccuracies
in estimating the ages for giant stars (Hayden et al. 2022; Sharma
et al. 2022).
Another aspect to consider concerns the use of linear fittings
which can potentially constrain the interpretation of the data,
particularly when dealing with older stars. In fact, due to their in-
creased dispersion, linear regressions may no longer accurately
capture their trends. To best reproduce the di fferent chemical-
age features, as turnovers or varying slopes across age ranges,
Spina et al. (2016) explored hyperbolic and two-segmented line
fits in their study, while Casali et al. (2020) used a multivariate
linear regression, incorporating metallicity as a dimension. On
the same line, Delgado Mena et al. (2017) fit di fferent multi-
dimension relations to the abundance-age trends analysed in
their work. These attempts highlight that employing fitting mod-
els beyond linear regression could o ffer an alternative to replicate
the observed tagging trends. Nevertheless, employing higher-
order polynomials might also introduce additional complexity,
making it more challenging to interpret the results and to disen-
tangle the various dependencies.5. Discussion
Despite the extensive exploration of chemical tagging in recent
years, there are still open questions to be addressed. For instance,
which traits show the strongest dependence on metallicity and
how do we explain these dependences from the point of view
of Galactic evolution. Ultimately, in the complex scenario of
chemical trends, is it feasible to pinpoint "golden" candidates
for chemical tagging?
5.1. Assumption and implication in Galactic evolution
Given the extended metallicity and age ranges covered by our
sample, we were able to explore various abundance ratios at dif-
ferent metallicities. As outlined in other studies (e.g. Feltzing
et al. 2017; Delgado Mena et al. 2019; Casali et al. 2020; Ma-
grini et al. 2021), we observed a non-uniform pattern in the re-
lationship between abundance and age, attributed to variations
in metallicity. Specifically we found a decline of the slopes with
the [Fe /H] of the stars, meaning a decline in age predictability.
This behaviour needs to be considered when pursuing chem-
ical tagging, particularly for individual field stars. The depen-
dence on metallicity poses a constraint on the possibility of us-
ing the chemical-age relation within the context of Galactic Ar-
chaeology. Leveraging observed abundance patterns to constrain
chemical enrichment history and infer stellar ages can serve as a
potent tool but requires consideration from various perspectives.
Firstly, if we assume that stars of a specific age retain the
characteristics of their original gas, which should remain chem-
ically distinct, then the chemical space enables dating the star
and its hosting environment. However, this notion becomes less
straightforward when considering that stars posses di fferent birth
radii, being born in di fferent places.
Focusing on the metallicity dependence, it is essential to ac-
knowledge that despite assuming that the heritability of stars de-
scendent from the same gas cloud can be retrieved by chemical
abundances, the complexity of the combination of production
sites of the elements and the di fferent Galactic locations where
the stars are born can render this picture less straightforward to
interpret. Indeed, the abundances analysed in this work come
from a variety of sources which act on di fferent timescales ac-
cording to the theory of Galactic evolution (Freeman & Bland-
Hawthorn 2002b; Rix & Bovy 2013; Matteucci 2016). As dis-
cussed in Sect. 4.4, certain nucleosynthesis processes and their
associated yields, particularly for AGBs, are subject to the influ-
ence of the source’s metallicity. This dependence will inevitably
impact the production of various elements, leading in the final
production to the prevalence of certain elements over others, for
example in the first-peak and second-peak n-capture elements.
Alongside the diversity of production channels, it is impor-
tant to add to the picture the intricate diversity of chemical sub-
structures within our Galaxy, which suggests the presence of a
complex mixture of stellar populations. Indeed, the ISM will be
enriched di fferently according to the star formation rate and star
formation history characterising the Galactic volume considered.
This stochastic enrichment (Krumholz & Ting 2018) grows more
intricate when adding the role of stellar migration in blurring
chemical gradients and signatures as stars from di fferent sites
mix together. The variations in the chemical clock relations are
notably influenced by the diverse birth radii of stars (Sellwood &
Binney 2002b; Minchev et al. 2012), which in their abundances
carry the fingerprints of distinct local star formation histories, as
demonstrated by the recent work by Ratcli ffe et al. (2023b).
Article number, page 13 of 19A&A proofs: manuscript no. aanda
In our case the stellar sample is composed of field stars. Al-
though their positions place them in the Solar neighborhood (see
Fig. 1), it can not be ruled out that they might have travelled
across the Galactic disk. The spread in the age-metallicity rela-
tion (Fig. 7) and the presence of solar metallicity stars with ages
∼10 Gyr suggests that those older stars might have formed in
the inner Galaxy and then migrated radially towards the Solar
neighborhood. In such instances, the dispersion in the chemical-
age relations could potentially be attributed to di fferences in
birth radii (consequently di fferent local metallicity), that trace
the composition of the original ISM. A star formed in an ISM
with lower iron content undergoes a diminished supply of iron
for neutron capture processes (Karakas & Lugaro 2016; Ces-
cutti & Matteucci 2022), hence diminishing the production of
n-capture elements and weakening the [n-capture /α]-age trends.
Secondly, through the analysis with two known chemical
clocks mostly employed for solar analogous stars (see sect. 4.3),
we noted that these ratios for the solar group continue to serve
as reliable indicators of chemical enrichment also in the case
of our more evolved targets, i.e. giant stars. This aligns with
the results presented by Slumstrup et al. (2017), who confirmed
the tight correlation between [Y /Mg] and age for six evolved
stars. Berger et al. (2022) recovered significant trend for non-
solar FGK stars, even if less precise than the relations inferred
for solar analogues. Moreover, most of the coe fficients of the
solar group (see Table A.2) are in good agreement with the
ones found by Jofré et al. (2020), with the exception of Zr and
Al which show greater slopes in our work.
Hence, by confining the analysis to the solar metallicity
range, the chemical-age relations appear relatively consistent be-
tween RGB and MS stars, thus not dependent on detailed stellar
evolution. While we acknowledge the possibility that the poorly
understood mixing processes occurring in evolved stars (Mosser
et al. 2014) can alter the stellar compositions, these mechanisms
do not appear to erase the correlation between ages and α, n-
capture elements for giant stars making them valuable for Galac-
tic archaeology studies.
5.2. Limitation and caveats
When using chemical stellar dating, other variables might cause
the variations in the di fferent [X /Y]-age planes. Disentangling
the scatter due to astrophysical origin from the scatter caused by
method uncertainties is not trivial. The situation becomes more
severe in the low metallicity regime, where the age predictability
of the chemical clocks decreases.
The systematic average internal uncertainties of ∼0.03 dex
for [Y /Mg] and [Y /Al] (see Fig. 11) is smaller than the scat-
ter around the linear fit for each metallicty group, ranging from
0.05 to 0.15 dex. This means that the observed dispersion around
the linear fit can not be accounted for only by the internal preci-
sion. Other factors that a ffect the abundance measurements can
be errors from atomic di ffusion, molecular data, omission of
NLTE corrections and 3D e ffects, (Adibekyan et al. 2015; Storm
& Bergemann 2023; Alexeeva et al. 2023b), as well as the re-
liance on the chosen lines for abundance measurement (Nissen
& Gustafsson 2018; Jofré et al. 2019; Slumstrup et al. 2019). All
these external factors are partially responsible in the spread seen
in the chemical-age trends. The situation described above stress
the importance of having accurate and precise age and abun-
dance estimations when studying chemical trends in the context
of Galactic evolution.5.3. Exploring the best chemical traits
Despite the aforementioned factors, through our analysis we
have once again unveiled the age-related information conveyed
by the s-process over αelements. Owing to their di fferent nucle-
osynthesis processes and production timescales, the change with
time is strongly correlated to their element ratios, as can be seen
in Fig. 9. We confirm that the most significant correlation is evi-
dent in stars with solar-metallicity, gradually weakening in stars
with lower [Fe /H].
When examining the metallicity dependence of the various
combinations, we see that some n-capture elements such as Zr,
Sr, Y display considerable di fferences in the slopes, as can be
seen in Fig. 14. Therefore, we believe that, even when these ele-
ments display steep slopes and high correlation coe fficients with
ages, their sensitivity to stellar metallicity implies their lack of
universality. Nevertheless they can be used for specific metallic-
ity ranges, or their measurements could potentially be improved
by relying on a greater number of lines for their abundances.
Other abundance ratios display low dependencies in metallicity
but also small ρvalues, such as ratios involving Nd, thus failing
to encompass age-related information within their trends. The
combinations [s /r]-processes element also exhibit low dependen-
cies on [Fe /H] but looking at the values of the slopes in Table A.2
only the slope for [Zr /Eu] is greater than the threshold value, that
is 0.03 dex Gyr−1. On the other hand, ratios such as [Ce /Al] and
[Ce/Ti], despite having small dependence with metallicty, are re-
lated with age with slopes greater than 0.03 dex Gyr−1 showing
higher correlation coe fficients. On the whole, ratios comprising
Ce at numerators have generally lower metallicity dependence,
making them potentially reliable and consistent chemical clocks.
From these results it is not obvious to identify an ideal can-
didate for chemical-clocks. Although our analysis leans toward
ratios exhibiting slopes steep enough to retrieve age informa-
tion, but at the same time with small dependence on metallic-
ity. Even so, the selection of one element combination over an-
other relies on the precision attainable for each specific element.
This depends on factors such as the spectral type of the star, the
precision at which we can measure atmospheric parameters and
abundance, the number of measurable lines. We note that in this
analysis, we excluded iron-peak elements as we chose to prior-
itize examining the dependence on iron, hence not exploring all
the possible combinations of chemical traits.
6. Conclusion
No universally optimal abundance ratios for chemically dating
stars have emerged. This lack of universality spans across dif-
ferent metallicities (as discovered here and in various studies
such as Feltzing et al. 2017; Delgado Mena et al. 2017) and
position (Titarenko et al. 2019; Casali et al. 2020). We suggest
that the selection criteria should be contingent upon the metal-
licity range of the stars. Within this context, our analysis o ffers
a method to dentangle the dependence on metallicity by exam-
ining the e fficacy of various element ratios in retrieving age in-
formation within specific metallicity ranges. Indeed, it has been
demonstrated that certain ratios are applicable at solar metallic-
ity, exhibiting more pronounced age-related patterns, but they
lose their age correlations when applied to stars with lower iron
content. Others can be regarded as "golden" ratios because they
consistently hold true across all metallicities. As an example
the combinations of Zr over αelements can be used for solar
metallicity stars but proves less e ffective for most metal-poor
stars, as their slopes in the [X /Y]-age trend weaken. On the other
Article number, page 14 of 19S. Vitali et al.: Exploring the dependence of chemical traits on metallicity
hand, ratios with Ce and La appear to be easily usable at di ffer-
ent ranges of metallicities, being more independent on the stel-
lar iron content. Additionally, when selecting chemical candi-
dates, factors such as measurement precision, the type of the star
(which significantly impacts age determination), and the spatial
coverage of the sample should be kept in mind.
Despite not having found a consistency of the various chem-
ical clocks for the di fferent metallicity groups, we recovered [n-
capture /α]-age trends with an internal abundance precision of <
0.03 dex and a mean relative age uncertainties around 20%.
Our exploration of di fferent chemical ratios highlighted that
the potential of chemical clocks extends beyond stellar dating.
They can serve as valuable tools in identifying discrepancies in
age estimation, especially in cases where stars might have pre-
viously been part of binary systems and subsequently accreted
mass, as we speculate for two stars in our sample. This poten-
tial can be harnessed to detect such stars, which might otherwise
remain hidden by a chemical analysis alone or within single evo-
lutionary tracks that do not account for binary systems.
Notwithstanding the non-universality of chemical traits,
abundance ratios remain a source of key information in Galactic
Archaeology. Thanks to the recent massive spectroscopic sur-
veys and the revolutionary data from Gaia DR3 they enable us
to build a chronological map of the Milky Way by linking chem-
istry and stellar ages.

Table A.1. The EPIC (K2) IDs are listed in the first column for the entire sample. Subsequently, the Gaia IDs along with with their corresponding
coordinates (RA and DEC) and Gmagnitudes are presented. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) are presented in the sixth column. The asteroseismic
frequency separation ∆ν, together with the frequency of maximum power νmaxwere obtained from the K2 catalogue. Finally the 2MASS magni-
tudes are reported in J, H and K bands. The two stars likely parts of binary systems are not listed in the table.
