Abstract —Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has
been envisioned as a promising technique to alleviate the sp ec-
trum congestion problem. Inspired by the applications of re con-
ﬁgurable intelligent surface (RIS) in dynamically manipul ating
wireless propagation environment, in this paper, we invest igate to
deploy a RIS in an ISAC system to pursue performance improve-
ment. Particularly, we consider a RIS-assisted ISAC system where
a multi-antenna base station (BS) performs multi-target de tection
and multi-user communication with the assistance of a RIS. O ur
goal is maximizing the weighted summation of target detecti on
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) by jointly optimizing the tr ansmit
beamforming and the RIS reﬂection coefﬁcients, while satis fying
the communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, the
total transmit power budget, and the restriction of RIS phas e-
shift. An efﬁcient alternating optimization algorithm com bining
the majorization-minimization (MM), penalty-based, and m an-
ifold optimization methods is developed to solve the result ing
complicated non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results
illustrate the advantages of deploying RIS in ISAC systems a nd
the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

I. I NTRODUCTION
With the explosive growth in demands of wireless com-
munication, spectrum resources are becoming increasingly
scare. Researchers have recently engaged in investigating the
spectrum sharing between radar systems and communication
systems, which is known as the integrated sensing and com-
munication (ISAC) technique. ISAC enables a fully-shared
platform that leverages shared resources to simultaneousl y
implement communication and sensing functionalities, whi ch
greatly promotes the spectrum and hardware efﬁciencies.
Therefore, ISAC has been envisioned as one of the key
enabling technologies in the future network [1], [2].
One of the major research ﬁelds in ISAC systems is
designing the dual-functional transmit waveform. Since th e
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technique can exploit mor e
spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs), it has been widely em-
ployed in ISAC systems to achieve beamforming gains [3].
However, severe channel degradation is inevitable in pract ical
environment, resulting in the unsatisfactory performance . One

Q. Liu is with the School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian Uni-
versity of Technology, Dalian 116024, China (e-mail: qianl iu@dlut.edu.cn).promising technology to tackle this problem is the reconﬁg-
urable intelligent surface (RIS) technique.
RIS is generally composed of a planar metasurface with
passive, cost-effective, and hardware-efﬁcient reﬂectin g ele-
ments [4]. Since additional non-line-of-sight (NLoS) link s are
established by deploying the RIS, more DoFs can be exploited
to promote the system performance. In light of these advan-
tages, the application of RIS in ISAC systems has attracted
extensive research [5]-[7]. In [5], the authors jointly opt imized
the transmit beamforming and the RIS elements to maximize
the communication data rate and the mutual information (MI)
for radar sensing. The authors in [6] deployed a RIS in an
ISAC system with multiple targets and single user. A similar
scenario was also considered in [7] where a dual-function ba se
station (BS) simultaneously detects single target and serv es
multiple users with the assistance of a RIS. It is noticed
that both [6] and [7] focused on the special scenario where
the direct link between the BS and the target is blocked.
Moreover, the general scenario with multiple potential tar gets
and multiple users is not considered in these works.
Motivated by the above ﬁndings, in this paper we consider a
more typical scenario where a dual-functional BS successiv ely
detects multiple point-like targets and simultaneously se rves
multiple users via the direct links as well as with the assis-
tance of a RIS. In particular, we aim to jointly optimize the
transmit beamforming and RIS elements to promote the target
detection performance, in terms of the weighted summation
of radar signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), under the constrai nts of
communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, the total
transmit power budget, and the restriction of RIS elements. In
order to tackle the resulting complicated non-convex optim iza-
tion problem, we develop an efﬁcient alternating optimizat ion
algorithm combining the majorization-minimization (MM),
penalty-based, and manifold optimization methods. Finall y,
numerical results reveal the advantages of deploying RIS in
ISAC systems and the effectiveness of our proposed algorith m.
II. S YSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
We consider a narrowband RIS-assisted ISAC system as
depicted in Fig. 1, where a multi-antenna BS equipped with
Mtransmit/receive antennas detects Tpoint-like targets and
simultaneously serves Ksingle-antenna users with the as-
sistance of an N-element RIS. In order to avoid the strong
interference from different targets and reduce the design
complexity, Tpotential targets are successively detected in
a time-division fashion during the channel coherent time ofRIS t-th target

communication users. In speciﬁc, the transmission period i s
divided into Ttime-slots, each of which is utilized to detect
one target and simultaneously serves Kusers.
The transmit signal of the BS is expressed as [8]
x=Wcsc+Wrsr=Ws, (1)
whereWc∈CM×KandWr∈CM×Mdenote the communi-
cation beamforming matrix and the radar beamforming matrix ,
respectively. Vector sc∈CKrepresents the communication
symbol vector with E{scsH
c}=IK, and vector sr∈CM
is the radar probing signal with E{srsH
r}=IM. They
are assumed to be statistically independent of each other.
For brevity, we deﬁne the overall beamforming matrix as
W/defines[WcWr]∈CM×(K+M)and the transmit symbol
vector as s/defines/bracketleftbig
sT
csT
r/bracketrightbigT∈CK+M.
From the radar detection perspective, since the target dete c-
tion probability is proportional to the radar SNR, we aim to
maximize the weighted radar sum-SNR of all targets to pursue
better target detection performance. As shown in Fig. 1, the
transmit probing signal will reach the t-th target via the direct
link (the blue dashed line) and the reﬂected link (the red sol id
line), and then reﬂect back to the BS via all propagation link s.
The propagation delay between these paths is negligible and
not taken into consideration. Thus, during the t-th time-slot,
the collected echo signal from the t-th target is given by
yr,t= (hd,t+GTΦhr,t)(hT
d,t+hT
r,tΦG)Ws+nr,(2)
wherehd,t∈CM,hr,t∈CNandG∈CN×Mdenote the
baseband channels between the BS and the t-th target, between
the RIS and the t-th target, and between the BS and the RIS,
respectively. The target channel is the line-of-sight (LoS ) link
with given angle of departure (AoD). The reﬂection matrix of
the RIS is deﬁned as Φ/definesdiag(φ)whereφ/defines[φ1,···,φN]T
is restricted with |φn|= 1,∀n. The vector nr∼ CN(0,σ2
rIM)
denotes the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Then, the
radar SNR of the t-th target is thus given as
SNRt=E/braceleftbig
|HtWs|2/bracerightbig
σ2r=Tr(WHHH
tHtW)
σ2r,(3)
where for brevity we deﬁne the equivalent channel matrix as
Ht/defines(hd,t+GTΦhr,t)(hT
d,t+hT
r,tΦG). (4)From the communication perspective, a widely adopted cri-
terion is guaranteeing the communication SINR requirement .
The received signal at the k-th user can be expressed as
yk= (hT
d,k+hT
r,kΦG)x+nk, (5)
wherehd,k∈CMandhr,k∈CNdenote the baseband channels
between the BS and the k-th user, and between the RIS and the
k-th user, respectively. It is assumed that all the channel st ate
information (CSI) is perfectly known at the BS given efﬁcien t
channel estimation approaches [9]. The scalar nk∼ CN(0,σ2
k)
denotes the AWGN with variance σ2
kat thek-th user. The
communication SINR of the k-th user is thus given as

In this paper, we jointly design the beamforming matrix W
and the reﬂection coefﬁcients φto maximize the weighted
radar sum-SNR, while satisfying the communication QoS
requirement, the total transmit power budget, and the unit-
modulus phase-shift of the RIS. The optimization problem ca n

that problem (7) is a complicated non-convex problem, which
is difﬁcult to optimize due to the non-convex objective func -
tion (7a), the unit-modulus constraint (7d), and the mutual ly
coupled variables Wandφ. Thus, an alternating optimization
strategy is exploited to solve problem (7) in the next sectio n.
III. J OINT BEAMFORMING AND RIS R EFLECTION DESIGN
FORRIS-A SSISTED ISAC S YSTEMS
In this section, we convert problem (7) into two more
tractable sub-problems and develop efﬁcient algorithms to
iteratively solve them.
A. Optimize the beamforming matrix W

It is obvious that problem (8) is a non-convex quadratically
constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which
can be converted into a semi-deﬁnite programming (SDP)
problem by utilizing the semi-deﬁnite relaxation (SDR) str at-
egy. However, a rank-one optimal solution usually cannot be
guaranteed. In this case, some approximation techniques su ch
as Gaussian randomization should be employed to construct a n
approximately optimal solution, which dramatically incre ases
the computational complexity and cannot guarantee the con-
vergence of overall algorithm.
In order to avoid the prohibitively high complexity of the
SDR strategy, we propose to construct a series of easy-to-
optimize surrogate functions for the non-convex objective
function (8a) based on the MM method. Speciﬁcally, with the
obtained solution Wiin thei-th iteration, a more tractable
surrogate function, which approximates (8a) at the current
local point Wiand serves as a lower bound, is constructed as
Tr(WHC1W) =/tildewidewH(CT

where for simplicity we deﬁne
/tildewidew/definesvec(WH), (12)
c1/defines−(/tildewidewi)H(CT
1⊗I)/tildewidewi. (13)
Substituting (11) into (8a) and ignoring the constant term,
the beamforming design problem (8) can be reformulated as

Although the constraint (14b) is still non-convex, it can be
converted into a form of second-order cone, which can be
effectively solved by the second-order cone programming
(SOCP) method [10].
B. Optimize the reﬂection coefﬁcients φ
With given W, the optimization problem with respect to φ
can be formulated as

|φn|= 1, (15c)
where for brevity we deﬁne C2,t/definesωt(W∗WT)⊗I
σ2r. It is noted
that the matrix Htis quadratic with respect to φas denoted in
(4), and thus the objective function (15a) is a quartic funct ion,
which causes signiﬁcant difﬁculties in solving problem (15 ).
Moreover, the fractional terms with quadratic functions in
constraint (15b) and the unit-modulus constraint (15c) als o
hinder the solution of problem (15).In order to tackle these difﬁculties, we construct a penaliz ed
problem and solve it with the MM and manifold methods.
Firstly, auxiliary variables ak,j,∀k,∀jare introduced to trans-
form the constraint (15b) into

k≥Γk,∀k, (16a)
ak,j=hT

Then, constraint (16b) is relaxed and added to the objective
function as a penalty term. Thus, the original problem (15)
can be converted into the following penalized problem

we deﬁne

d,t)
+(hd,t⊗Bt+Bt⊗hd,t)φ.(19)
With given ρ, since the variables φandak,j,∀k,∀jare
coupled in problem (17), we propose to convert it into two
sub-problems and iteratively optimize each variable as fol lows.
With given ak,j,∀k,∀j, the optimization problem (17) with
respect to φcan be formulated as

It can be easily observed that problem (20) is still difﬁcult
to optimize due to the non-convex objective function (20a)
and unit-modulus constraint (20b). Although the objective
function (20a) is smooth and differentiable, the ﬁrst term

t=1vH
tC2,tvtis a complicated quartic polynomial ex-
pression with respect to φ, whose ﬁrst-order derivative is
difﬁcult to obtain. Thus, we exploit the MM method to make
it easier to tackle. Speciﬁcally, with the obtained solutio nφi

in (20a) can be constructed as

Similarly, based on (9) and some algebra transformations,
the second term in (20a) can be equivalently re-written as

We observe that the objective function (28a) is smooth with
easy-to-obtain derivatives. Additionally, the unit-modu lus con-
straint (28b) forms a complex circle Riemannian manifold,
which allows problem (28) to be solved by the typical Rie-
mannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm. After derivin g
the Riemannian gradient from the corresponding Euclidean
gradient, we utilize the idea of conjugate gradient algorit hm
to solve problem (28) on the Riemannian space. The details
of RCG algorithm are omitted here due to space limitations
and can be found in [11].
With given φ, the sub-problem of updating ak,j,∀k,∀jcan
be formulated as

penalty coefﬁcient ρare iteratively updated by (14), (28), (29)

IV. S IMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we numerically evaluate the performance of
our proposed algorithm in the considered RIS-assisted ISAC
system. It is assumed that the BS equipped with M= 16
antennas in half-wavelength antenna spacing detects T= 3
point-like targets and simultaneously serves K= 4 single-
antenna users with the assistance of an N-element RIS. The
potential targets are located at the azimuth angles of [ −30◦,
0◦,30◦], and the users are distributed around the RIS. The
distances of BS-target, BS-RIS, and RIS-user links are set a s
30m, 35m, and 3m, respectively. We adopt the typical distanc e-
dependent path-loss model [12] and set the path-loss expone nts
of BS-RIS, RIS-target, RIS-user, BS-target and BS-user lin ks
asαBR=αRt=αRu= 2.3,αBt= 2.7andαBu= 3.3,
respectively. The Rician fading channel model is assumed wi th
the Rician factors of RIS-user link being βRu= 3dB and other
links being 0dB. The noise power at the radar receiver and
thek-th user are set as σ2
r=σ2
k=−80dBm,∀k. The SINR
requirement for all users is set to the same value Γk= Γ,∀k.
We set the weighted coefﬁcients ωt= 1,∀tfor simplicity.
We ﬁrst present the convergence performance of the pro-
posed algorithm in Fig. 2. It can be easily observed that the
achievable radar sum-SNR of all schemes can converge within
about 30 iterations.
The radar sum-SNR versus the transmit power is shown
in Fig. 3. In order to verify the effectiveness of the pro-
posed algorithm (“ISAC, proposed”), the schemes without20 24 28 32 36 40

RIS (“ISAC, w/o RIS”) and with random phase-shift RIS
(“ISAC, random RIS”) are included. Besides, the radar-only
(“Radar”) systems with or without RIS are also included as
benchmarks to present the upper bound of target detection
performance. We observe that the schemes with RIS are better
than those without RIS in both radar-only and ISAC systems,
because RIS introduces additional NLoS links to achieve
passive beamforming gain. Moreover, the “ISAC, proposed”
scheme can achieve about 4dB performance improvement than
other schemes in the considered ISAC system, which veriﬁes
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Additionally , there
exists a performance gap between the radar-only system and
the considered ISAC system due to the trade-off between the
communication and radar detection performance.
Then, we plot the radar sum-SNR versus the number of
RIS elements in Fig. 4. It can be found that the radar sum-
SNR increases with the increasing number of RIS elements,
because more reﬂection elements provide more spatial DoFs
to enhance the performance. In addition, compared with the
“ISAC, w/o RIS” scheme, the proposed algorithm for the RIS
withN= 60 elements achieves about 6dB performance gain
by smartly tailoring the propagation environments.
Finally, we show the radar sum-SNR and communication
QoS requirement in Fig. 5. Not surprisingly, there exists a
trade-off between the radar detection and communication pe r-
formance. As the communication QoS requirement increases,
the radar sum-SNR achieved by the considered ISAC system
decreases, because more resources are allocated to guarant ee
the communication QoS.
V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the joint transmit beamform-
ing and RIS reﬂection design for a RIS-assisted ISAC system,
where the RIS is deployed to simultaneously assist multi-
target detection and multi-user communication. The radar s um-
SNR was maximized under the constraints of communication
SINR, the total transmit power budget, and the RIS reﬂection
coefﬁcients. An efﬁcient alternating optimization algori thm
was developed to solve the resulting complicated non-conve x
problem. Numerical results demonstrated the advantages ofdeploying RIS in ISAC systems as well as revealed the
performance trade-off. We will extend our work to more
practical scenarios where there exist clutters, as well as t he
crucial fairness issue.
