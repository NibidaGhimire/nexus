Abstract. We study the error-correction problem of the communication be-
tween two vertices in a social network. By applying the conce pts of coding
theory into the Social Network Analysis (SNA), we develop th e code social
network model, which can oﬀer an eﬃcient way to ensure the cor rectness of
the message transmission within the social netwoks. The res ult of this study
could apply in vary of social science studies.
Keywords. Coding Theory, SNA
1.Introduction
1.1.Overview of Apply Coding Theory and SNA. The application of coding
theory to social network analysis has been a topic of great interes t in recent years.
Coding theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the eﬃcient transmission
of information over noisy channels. It is used to design codes that c an be used
to encode and decode messages, allowing for reliable communication e ven in the
presence of noise.
Regarding to SNA, it has used in the various algorithms to analysis net works
such as pathﬁnding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra’s Algorithm), communit y detection
algorithms(e.g., Girvan-NewmanAlgorithm), linkpredictionalgorithms (e.g., Katz
index), andgraphembeddingalgorithms(e.g., DeepWalk, see: Peroz zi,Al-Rfouand
Skiena [1]) Pathﬁnding algorithms (Foead et al. [2]) are used to ﬁnd the shortest
path between two nodes while community detection algorithms are us ed to identify
groups of nodes that are more densely connected than others in a network (Lanci-
chinetti and Fortunato [3]) Link prediction algorithms (L¨ u and Zhou [4]) are used
to predict future connections between nodes while graph embeddin g algorithms
are used to represent networks in low-dimensional vector spaces for further anal-
ysis or visualization purposes. Some others worth-noticing algorith ms including
the Node2Vec (Grover and June 2017), which is an algorithm for lear ning low-
dimensional representations of nodes in a graph, and it uses rando m walks to ex-
plore the graph structure and learn node embeddings that captur e both local and
global network properties (For example: Hu et al. [5]) Graph Convolu tional Net-
works (GCN) algorithm that can be used to learn representations o f nodes in a
graph, and it has been used for tasks such as node classiﬁcation, lin k prediction,

and community detection (Zhang et al. [6]) GraphSAGE is an inductive represen-
tation learning algorithm (Hamilton, Ying and Leskovec[7]) for graphs can be used
for tasks such as node classiﬁcation, link prediction, and community detection.
SNA has been used to study a variety of topics, such as the spread of disease,
the diﬀusion of innovations, and the formation of social movements . Despite its
widespread use in many areas, there is still a lack of research and mo deling of
information transmission within social networks in SNA.
1.2.Limitationsof Information Transmissionof the SNA. Informationtrans-
missionisanimportantprocessin socialnetworksbecauseit allowsfo rthe spreadof
ideas and knowledge among individuals. This process can be studied th rough vari-
ous methods such as surveys, interviews, or experiments. Howev er, these methods
are often limited in their ability to capture the complexity of informatio n trans-
mission within social networks. As a result, there is a need for more r esearch into
how information ﬂows through social networks and how it aﬀects be havior and
outcomes.
The ﬁrst limitation of SNA is that it relies on data from existing network s and
hard to simulation. This means that it hard to simulate or capture info rmation
about new connections or changes within an existing connections of social network.
Additionally, current studies about SNA do not consider the size and transmitted
bound in which information is transmitted or received systematically b y mathe-
matical method.
A second limitation of SNA is that it does not capture the content of in forma-
tion transmission. While currently SNA can provide insight into how info rmation
spreads within a network, it cannot provide insight into what type of information is
being shared or how it is being interpreted by diﬀerent individuals within the net-
work, or how the nodes within a social networkmade the errorand e rror-correcting.
Thiscanleadtoinaccurateconclusionsabouthowinformationsprea dswithin anet-
work and how it aﬀects behavior within the network. For example, wh at political
scientists consider to be a considerable degreeof the failure of Zha o Ziyang’s faction
during the Tiananmen crisis in 1989 (Fewsmith [8]; Ziyang [9]) appears to us to be,
to some extent, information transmission errors within his factiona l network.
Currently, there has two ways to study information transmission w ithin social
networks. First one is through Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), which is a type
of computer simulation that uses agents—individuals or entities—to r epresent dif-
ferent actors in a system. These agents interact with each other according to
certain rules that are programmed into the model (For example: Fr ias-Martinez,
Williamson and Frias-Martinez [10]; Lane [11]; Li et at. [12]) Another way to study
information transmission within social networks is through network analysis tools
such as graph theory or Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs ), it provides
insights into the structure of a network by analyzing its nodes (indiv iduals) and
edges (relationships between individuals).
However, research about information transmission within social ne tworks is still
lacking in terms of mathematical algorithms. Algorithms are the back bone of any
meaningful SNA, as they are responsible for organizing and managin g the informa-
tion within the social networks.
1.3.Structure. The paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 is a quick review for some basic concept.3
In section 3, we will deﬁne what is Coding Social Network (CSN), by ex plaining
background parameters, introducing how to encode the most bas ic simple social
network. Then we will classifying the diﬀerent types of simple CSN
In section 4, we will explain how to perform error detection and corr ection for
complex social networks (usually, a complex social network is compo sed of multiple
simple social networks). And we will encode a “prefect covering soc ial network and
give examples.
In section 5, we will discuss the size of a perfect CSN
Section 6 is an application, our aim in this example is to showcase an applic ation
in political science of CSN through an example of Chinese elite politics.
1.4.Academic Contribution of Our Study. Applying coding theory to SNA
can provide valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of com plex social
systems of social science studies.
In the context of SNA, mathematically, coding theory can be used t o encode the
distance, size, errorand error-correcting,and upper&bottom bound ofinformation
transmission. For example, it can be used to investigate the amount of noise in a
network by encoding messages using an error-correctingcode. T his allows for more
accurate to see transmission of information between nodes in a soc ial network, as
well as could reviewing and reducing the amount of information that n eeds to be
transmitted within social networks.
In practice, ﬁrstly, by establishing a CSN, our study could contribu te to the ﬁeld
of political factional and elite politics studies by examining the eﬃcienc y of factions
and simulating the transmission path within these groups. This appro ach would
allow us to identify key players, their relationships, and communicatio n patterns,
whichcan help us understandhow factionsoperateand howthey inﬂ uence decision-
making over processes, by using. Coding theory could to analyze CS N data, so that
wecandetect patternsofinformationﬂowofthe informationtran smissionswithin a
political faction and identify potential bottlenecks or vulnerabilities in the political
factions.
Another possible application is CSN could be used in studies about the f orma-
tion of interest groups and simulate the transmission path of the lob by process.
This could help solve questions about the relationships between politic ians and in-
terest groups. By analyzing the coded data, researchers can ide ntify patterns and
trends in social networks between the politicians and lobbers that m ay not be im-
mediately apparent, and it can then be used to inform policy decisions , improve
communication strategies, and enhance social network structur es.
Furthermore, CSN can be used in studies about the dynamic social n etwork
of social movements and ethnic conﬂicts. It can help researchers understand why
some social movements lead to a bloody end, such as the Tiananmen m ovement
in 1989, or why a speciﬁc ethnic conﬂict happened. By analyzing the p atterns of
communication and interaction within these networks, CSN can prov ide insights
into the factors that contribute to their success or failure. This in formation can
be used to develop strategies for preventing or resolving conﬂicts and promoting
peaceful coexistence among diﬀerent groups.
2.Preliminaries
In this section, we give a quick review for some basic concepts of err or-correction
codes. For more details, we recommend readers the book [13].4
LetPnbe the collection of all vectors in Fn
q, whereFqis a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q
elements. A code Cof length nis deﬁned as a subset of Pn. The elements of Care
called codewords. Moreover, for a= (a1,...,a n),b(b1,...,b n)∈ Pn, we can deﬁne
their Hamming distance as follows:
dH(a,b) =|{i:ai/\e}atio\slash=bi}|.
The minimum distance dof a code Cis described as the minimum Hamming dis-
tance between codewords in C. Moreover, the weight of a codeword ais deﬁned
as
wt(a) =d(a,0),
where0 is the zero vector. The minimum distance is high related to the ability o f
error detection and error correction. A code with minimum distance dcan detect
d−1 errors and correct ⌊d−1
2⌋errors.
For general C, to check if a codeword acontains an error, we need to check
whether a∈Cor not. It may cost lots of time when qis large. In here, we also
introduce a special code structure, which provide a convenient wa y to deal with this
problem, called linear code. A linear code Cis deﬁned as a k-dimensional subspace
ofFn
q. Moreover, a linear code can be generated by an n×kmatrixMsuch that
C= Im(M). In this case, Mis called the generated matrix of C. The encoding
processEfor message mcan be deﬁned as follows:
E(m) =Mm.
For the matrix M, there exists an ( n−k)×nmatrixNwith rank n−ksatisfying
NM= 0.Nis called the parity check matrix and for a∈Fn
q,a∈Cif and only if
Na= 0. Moreover, we denote Cby the parameter [ n,k,d]q, wherenis the length
ofC,kis the dimension of Cas a subspace and dis the minimum distance.
Example 1. We deﬁne C= [7,4,3]2by the generated matrix
M=

0 0 0 1

.
Then, the parity check matrix can be taken as
N=
0 0 0 1 1 1 1

1 0 1 0 1 0 1

3.Code social network
3.1.From social network to code social network. Now, we deﬁne S= (V,D)
to be a social network with vertex set Vand edge set D. Note that in the following,
we use the word “vertex” to replace “node” in social network analy sis and regard
a social network as a graph. For our description, we give an example in Figure 1.
Then, we deﬁne the code social network(CSN) ˆS= (S,C,f) as a weighted network
which has the same vertex set and edge set as Stogether with a code C⊂Fq. Let
a= (a1,...,a n)∈C. An error occurring on aiis assumed as a map sending aito5
an element of Fq\airandomly. For ( α,β)∈D, we denote the probability that an
error occurs on aiwhenαsendsatoβbyp(α,β)(ai). To simplify our model, we
assume that the probability p(α,β)(ai) is independent on the component iand the
codeword a. Moreover, we denote p(α,β)(ai) asp(α,β). Then, we weight the edge
(α,β) by the weight function fdeﬁned by f(α,β) =p(α,β).
Deﬁnition 1. Letα,β∈VandP(α,β)= (α=γ0,γ1,...,γ l=β) be a path from
αtoβon the weighted network ˆS. Now,αsends a codeword aalong the path
Path(α,β)toβandβreceives the codeword a′. LetE(α,β)be the expectation value
of the Hamming distance dH(a,a′). Then, we deﬁne the follows.
(1)P(α,β)is said to be eﬃcient if EP(α,β)≤ ⌊d−1
2⌋,
(2)P(α,β)is said to be semi-eﬃcient if EP(α,β)≤d−1,
(3)P(α,β)is said to be ineﬃcient if EP(α,β)> d−1.
Remark 2. Under our deﬁnition and assumption, for two paths P(α,β),P′
(α,β)with
P(α,β)has a longer length, we do not have EP(α,β)≥EP′(α,β).
Deﬁnition 3. LetˆS= (S,C,f) be a CSN. We deﬁne the follows.
(1)ˆSis said to be eﬃcient if for each α,β∈V, the shortest path from αtoβ
is eﬃcient,
(2)ˆSis said to be semi-eﬃcient if for each α,β∈V, the shortest path from α
toβis semi-eﬃcient,
(3)ˆSis said to be ineﬃcient if ˆSis not semi-eﬃcient,
(4) The critical value C(ˆS) ofˆSas
C(ˆS) = max{l(α,β)|(α,β)∈D},
wherel(α,β) is denoted by the length of the shortest path from αtoβ.

there are only odd edges which cause error. Then, the expectatio n value of the

Proof.According to the above deﬁnitions, Airepresents the probability that by
comparing with the original codeword, an error occurs on one comp onent of the
messageafter passing iedges within a social network. Then, we havethe result. /square
3.2.Transmission path on eﬃcient CSN. LetˆS= (S,C,f) be an eﬃcient
CSN. In this part, we give a convenient method to ﬁgure out the tra nsmission path
fromαtoβby labeling each vertex a codeword in FN
qfor some Nis suﬃcient
large. First, we start with the deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 6. LetˆS= (S,C,f) be an eﬃcient CSN. If there is a spanning tree
T= (V,D′) such that ˆT= (T,C,f′) with
f(α,β) =f′(α,β) for (α,β)∈D′
is eﬃcient, ˆSis called super-eﬃcient.
For a super-eﬃcient CSN ˆStogether with an eﬃcient ˆT, our goal is to label each
vertex in Vby the function φ, which is an injective map from VtoFN
qsuch that
forα,β∈V, the path from αtoβinTcan be determined by comparing φ(a) with
φ(b)). Here, we present the rules for deﬁning φ.7
(1) Ifγis the root of T,φ(γ) is the zero vector.
(2) Let( α,β)∈D′withαislabeledand βisunlabeled. Let φ(α) = (a1,...,a N)
andk= max{i:ai/\e}atio\slash= 0}. If there is bk+1such that the codeword
b= (a1,...,a k,bk+1,0,...,0) is not used, let φ(β) =b. Otherwise, we
labelβby the vector ( a1,...,a k,0,1,0...,0).
Under this labeling, if αwants to send a message to βwith knowing φ(β), a
good transmission path can be found as follows.
(1) If wt( φ(α))≥wt(φ(β)),ashould send the message to the vertex which is
labeled as the codeword obtained by changing the last non-zero ter m in
φ(α) to 0.
(2) Ifwt( φ(α))<wt(φ(β)),βshouldreceivethe messagefromthe vertexwhich
is labeled as the codeword obtained by changing the last non-zero te rm in
φ(β) to 0.
Example 2. LetS= (V,D) withV={1,2,3,4,5,6}andD={(1,2), (1,5),
(2,3),(2,5),(3,4),(4,5),(4,6)}. LetC⊂Fn
2be a code with minimum distance
d≥n
50+ 1 and n= 10. Let f(a,b) =p=1
100for all (a,b)∈D. We deﬁne
ˆS= (S,C,f) and obvious that C(ˆS) = 3. Then, by applying Lemma 4, we can
checknp=n

Thus,ˆSis eﬃcient. Let T= (V,D′) withD′={(6,4),(4,3),(4,5),(5,2),(5,1)}.
We can calculate that ˆSis super-eﬃcient together with the spanning tree T. We
deﬁneφas a map from VtoF5
2by
φ(6) = (0,0,0,0,0), φ(4) = (1,0,0,0,0),
φ(3) = (1,1,0,0,0), φ(5) = (1,0,1,0,0),
φ(2) = (1,0,1,1,0), φ(1) = (1,0,1,0,1),
and
Im(φ) ={(0,0,0,0,0),(1,0,0,0,0),(1,1,0,0,0),
(1,0,1,0,0),(1,0,1,1,0),(1,0,1,0,1)}.
When vertex 6 wants to send a message to vertex 1, wt( φ(6)) = 0 <3 = wt(φ(1))
implies that we should compare φ(6) with φ(1) and ﬁgure out what jis. By
observing j= 1, vertex 6 should send the message to vertex 4 which is labeled by
(1,0,0,0,0). By repeating this process, vertex 4 should send the message r eceiving
from vertex 6 to vertex 5 with the label (1 ,0,1,0,0). Then, vertex 5 sends the
message to vertex 1.
φ(6) = (0,0,0,0,0)→φ(4) = (1,0,0,0,0)→
φ(5) = (1,0,1,0,0)→φ(1) = (1,0,1,0,1).
Now, we consider the case that vertex 3 wants to send a message t o vertex 2.
wt(φ(3)) = 2 <3 = wt(φ(2)) and the 2th component of φ(3) is 1 but φ(2) contains
0 in the same position. By our rule, vertex 3 should send the message to a vertex,8

which is labeled by (1 ,0,0,0,0). That is vertex 4. Then, vertex 4 should compare
φ(4) with φ(2) and ﬁgure out the label by changing the third component of φ(4) to
1. Then, vertex 4 should send the message to the vertex 5. Then, vertex 5 sends
the message to vertex 2.
φ(3) = (1,1,0,0,0)→φ(4) = (1,0,0,0,0)→
φ(5) = (1,0,1,0,0)→φ(2) = (1,0,1,1,0).
Remark 7. Each vertex in an eﬃcient CSN only needs to keep the code Im( φ)
and compare the label of itself with the terminal vertex to ﬁnd a pat h, which is
good enough in the sense of error-correction (but not necessar y to be the shortest
path), instead of using the traditional Dijkstra Algorithm to ﬁgure out and save
every shortest paths.
Remark 8. ForeﬃcientCSNs, wecanclassifythemintothefollowingthreeclasse s.
(1) IfSis a tree, we say that ˆSis in type A.
(2) IfSis dense but not a tree, we say ˆSis in type B.
(3) IfSis a complete graph, we say ˆSis in type C.
Readers might refer Figure 2 as an example. Clearly, for type A, our method
mentionedbeforealwaysusethe shortestpath. Fortype C, wecanlabelthe vertices
by codewords in a simplex code. Under this method, we can identify wh etherSis
a complete graph or not by observing the codewords so that in the c ase of type C,
we can use the shortest path to complete our transmission.
Remark 9. The social network can be seen in many diﬀerent forms in our society .
For example, the political factionalism of the USSR and China is a prime e xample
of a social network. This type of network is characterized by comp osing of mul-
tiple political etlites that are connected through a complex web of allia nces and
co-interests. Additionally, interest groups lobby-networks in the United States are
another example of a non-digraph social network. These network s are composed
of various interest groups that are attempting to inﬂuence policy d ecisions through
lobbying eﬀorts. Finally, kinship networks within ancient China can also be con-
sidered as a type of non-digraph and muti-centralized complex socia l network (a

4.Error detection and correction in Complex CSN
In this section, we start to apply our model to more complex cases.
4.1.Covering by super-eﬃcient CSNs. For a non-eﬃcient CSN ˆS= (S,C,f)
and vertices α,β, there might not exist an eﬃcient path from αtoβ. To deal
with this situation, our approach is to cover each vertices in ˆSby super-eﬃcient
CSNs{ˆSi= (Si,C,f)}with each Si= (Vi,Di) is an induced subgraph of S.
Furthermore, to allow the transmission between diﬀerent ˆSi, we need to use a
“reachable” covering.
Deﬁnition 10. LetN={ˆSi}be a collection of CSNs.
(1)Nis said to be a covering of ˆSif eachSiis an induced subgraph of Sand/uniontext
iVi=V.
(2) A covering NofˆSis said to be reachable if for every subset AofP=
{1,...,|N|},/uniondisplay
i∈AVi∩/uniondisplay
i∈P\AVi/\e}atio\slash=∅.
Deﬁnition 11. We say that N={ˆSi}is an eﬃcient covering of ˆSif
(1)ˆSiis super-eﬃcient for each i,
(2)Nis a covering of ˆS, and
(3)Nis reachable.
Under this deﬁnition, every eﬃcient covering oﬀers a transmission p ath for a
pair of vertices in ˆS. Letα,βbe two vertices. Then, there exist i,jsuch that α
is a vertex of ˆSiandβis a vertex of ˆSj. Because of the reachable property, there
exist a sequence of super-eﬃcient CSNs {ˆSak}m
k=1for some integer msuch that
(1)ˆSa0=ˆSi,
(2)ˆSam=ˆSj,
(3)Vak∩Vak+1/\e}atio\slash=∅for allk.
Now, the transmission process from αtoβfollows the steps:
(1)αsends a message to a vertex α1inVa0∩Va1. Then,α1dose once error-
correction process.
(2) For each 1 ≤k≤m−1,αksends a message to a vertex αk+1inVak∩Vak+1.
Then,αk+1dose once error-correction process.
(3)αmsends the message to β. Then,βdose once error-correction and decod-
ing process to obtain the information.
To simplify our model, we suppose fis a constant map. Using the formulas
described in Lemma 4 and Lemma 5, we can estimate an integer rsuch that every
path with length less or equal to ris eﬃcient. For a vertex αand an integer k, we
deﬁneBk(α) as the induced subgraph with vertex set
{β∈V:dG(α,β)≤k},
wheredG(α,β) denotes the length of the shortest path from αtoβ. Under our
assumption, the CSN ( B⌊r
2⌋(α),C,f) is super-eﬃcient.
Deﬁnition 12. A subset Mr={αi} ⊂Vis said to be a covering set of ˆSif
{(Br(αi),C,f)}forms an eﬃcient covering of ˆS. Moreover, the maximum integer
rsuch that the covering set MrofˆSexists is called the radius of ˆS.10

Remark 13. Finding the smallest covering set of ˆSis high related to the problem
of minimum k-path vertex cover, which has been studied in [15], [16], and [17].
Every covering set represents a transmission method for every t wo vertices of ˆS.
Moreover, the size of a covering set implies the maximum times of erro r-correction
process should be applied during the transmission.
4.2.Perfect covering. In this part, we consider CSNs with a great structure,
which is called perfect covering.
Deﬁnition 14. LetˆSbe a CSN.
(1) An eﬃcient covering NofˆSis said to be perfect if for every ˆSi,ˆSj∈N,
Vi∩Vj/\e}atio\slash=∅.
(2)ˆSis called perfect if there exists a perfect covering.
With the given deﬁnition, we observe the simple result.
Lemma 15. Every transmission process between two vertices in a perfect CSN
only need to do the error-correction process twice.
Next, we present a convenient approach to construct a perfect CSN. Let kbe
given and Mbe a collection of vertices of a simplex in Rn. Now, for every a,b∈M,
we place a vertex eand two sequences of vertices {ai}k−1
i=1,{bi}k−1
i=1. Then, we
add edges ( a,a1),(b,b1),(ak−1,e),(bk−1,e),(ai,ai+1),and (bi,bi+1) for each i=
1,...k−2. Moreover, around each a∈M, we might add vertices and edges such
that all of those vertices can be connected to aby a path with length less than k.
Under this construction, we obtain a connected graph S. By choosing proper C
andfsuch that every path with length less or equal to 2 kis eﬃcient, we construct
a CSNˆS= (S,C,f) with a covering set Mk=M.
Example 3. LetM={1,2,3}be the vertex set of of a simplex in R2andk= 2.
Applying the method we mention before, we construct the CSN ˆSby the graph S
described in Figure 3 and some proper C,f. Under ˆS, if vertex 1 wants to send a
message to vertex 17, vertex 1 should encode the message by the codeCand send
the message along an eﬃcient path to vertex 4 ﬁrst. Then, vertex 4 dose once error-
correction process. Next, vertex 4 sends the message to verte x 17. Final, vertex 17
implement the error-correction and decoding process to obtain th e message.11
5.The size of a perfect CSN
In this section, we discuss the size of a perfect CSN. First, we give t he following
deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 16. LetˆSbe a CSN.
(1)ˆSwith a covering set Mr={αi}is said to have density eifBr(αi) contains
at mostevertices for each i.
(2) IfˆSisperfect,theminimumsizeofacoveringsetof ˆSiscalledthedimension
ofˆS.
(3) Letαbe a vertex of ˆSwithα∈Br(αi) andl(n)(α) be the collection of
vertices of Visuch that for β∈l(m)(α), the shortest path from αtoβhas
length less or equal to n. We deﬁne the inﬂuence of αwith degree ias
|lm(α)|and denote it by L(m)(α).
Remark 17. Forα∈Vi,β∈Vjwithi/\e}atio\slash=jandα,β /∈Vi∩Vj, the communication
betweenαandβshouldapplyatleastonceerror-correctionprocessbefore βreceives
the message. It costs time and resource. Thus, we limit the inﬂuenc e ofαto the
vertices which the transmission process do not need to do any erro r-correction
before the receiver receives the message.
Lemma 18. Letαbe a vertex in Br(αi). Then,
L(m)(α)≤

for each m.
Now, we give the lower bound and upper bound for the number of ver tices of a
perfect CSN with dimension nand density e.
Lemma 19. LetˆSbe a perfect CSN with radius r, dimension nand density e.
Then,
rn+/parenleftbiggn
2/parenrightbigg
≤V≤ne−/parenleftbiggn
2/parenrightbigg
.
Proof.The upper bound is simple. Every vertex in a covering set represent s at
mostevertices. However, the vertices in the intersection of two neighbo rhoods are
counted twice. Thus, we obtain the number ne−/parenleftbign
2/parenrightbig
. For the lower bound, each
neighborhood of a vertex in a covering set contains at least rvertices outside any
intersections. Thus, there are at least nr+/parenleftbign
r/parenrightbig
vertices. /square
6.Application
6.1.Background and Our Aims. Althoughthe perfect socialnetworkis diﬃcult
to ﬁnd in real society ,ineﬃcient social networks which have ineﬃcient information
transmission examples are vasely. Ineﬃcient information transmiss ion can lead to
information asymmetry, which occurs when one party has access t o more or better
information than the other, when one party has an informational a dvantage, they
may be able to exploit this advantage to gain a better outcome for th emselves at
the expense ofthe other party (For example: [18], [19], [20]) The ine ﬃcient decision-
making, especially in the public policy, is also a signiﬁcant outcome of ineﬃ cient
information transmission within the social network (For example: [21 ], [22], [23])12
Our aim in this example is to showcase the ineﬃciency of Hu Jintao’s leade rship
through an example of Chinese elite politics. According to a multitude o f elites, his
leadership has been widely criticized for being ineﬀective. Keller [24] ha s conducted
remarkable research on Chinese political elites, and we will utilize her w ork by
coding and applying our algorithm based on the Chinese political elite ne twork of
2012 drawn by Keller. This will enable us to demonstrate the ineﬃcienc y of the
social network during the Hu Jintao era.
6.2.Eﬃcient or ineﬃcient. IfLiuYuanwantstosendamessagetoHuChunhua,
the shortest path is
Liu Yuan →Xi Jinping →Li Zhanshu →Hu Jintao →Hu Chunhua .
Takep= 0.75, we can calculate

32.
Thus, the transmission path is not eﬃcient for all code with15n
32≤ ⌊d−1
2⌋, so isn’t
the social network. Moreover, there do not exist an eﬃcient cove ring since the
transmission path with length 1 can not be eﬃcient.
6.3.Comparative the Path of CCP 2012 Social Network and Eﬃcient
Social Network. If we take p= 0.001, we can calculate that for n= 10,d≥3,
anypathwithlengthlessorequalto100iseﬃcient, whichimpliestheso cialnetwork
is eﬃcient. In this case, we only do once error-correction process .
Clearly, for given social network Sand a code Cwith minimum distance greater
or equal to 3 (i.e, Ccan correct at least 1 error), there exists a probability pwhich
is small enough such that ˆS= (S,p,C) is eﬃcient. However, in some cases, we do
not have a communication channel whose pis small enough. For example, when
we discuss a communication between several people and each of the m sends their
message to others using nature language by face to face. There m ight be lots of
misunderstanding. Thus, in such case, pmight be very high. Then, our model can
oﬀer a convenient method to deal with this situation.
6.4.Error Detection and Correction of CCP 2012 Social Network. Now,
we consider p= 0.05 andCis a binary code with n= 10,d= 3. By calculation,
we know that every path with length less or equal to 2 is eﬃcient. Thu s, the social
network we discuss in this section is not eﬃcient. However, it is possib le to cover it
by eﬃcient networks. For example, we may simply take every importa nt name (i.e
the name connects to many people), such as Bo Xilai, Jiang Zemin and s o on, as
αi’s. It oﬀers us a covering {B1(αi)}. Then, the error-correction can be done and
the error in the message transmission can be avoided.
