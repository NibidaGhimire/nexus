Abstract—Nonlinear polarization evolution (NPE) is among the 
most advanced techniques for obtaining ultrashort pulses with 
excellent optical performance. However, it is challenging to  design 
environmentally stable NPE fiber oscillator s using only 
polarization -maintaining (PM) fibers. Here, we use the same PM 
fiber and non -reciprocal phase shifter to design  two different 
devices , which are capable of acting as effective NPE saturable 
absorbers (SAs) in two all-PM linear  cavity  fiber las ers. These two 
laser setup s differ in the position of the non -reciprocal phase 
shifter, the presence of which is crucial  for the proposed fiber 
lasers to reduce  their mode -locking thresholds and achieve high 
repetition rates above 100 MHz.  The mode -locking principle and 
pulse evolution in the laser cavity are investigated theoretically.  
The first all-PM fiber oscillator emits sub -200 fs stretched pulses 
with low peak power s. The second oscillator , with a simpler 
architecture , directly deliv ers stretched pulses with high peak 
power s, the spectral bandwidth greater than 30 nm , and the pulse 
duration less than 90 fs. To the best of our knowledge, 79 fs 
achieved in this design is the shortest pulse duration provided by  
PM fiber lasers using NPE mode -lockers.

I. INTRODUCTION  
TRAFAST  lasers are fundamental building blocks of 
diverse scientific and industrial applications such as 
terahertz -wave ge neration [1], optical frequency comb sources  
[2], and high -efficiency micromachining [3]. Compared to 
other types of pulsed lasers, fiber lasers are becoming 
increasingly competitive due to their compact ness, low 
implementation cost, and reduced thermal effects [4]. A key 
issue in the work with  fiber lasers is how to design a laser cavity 
delivering ultrashort pulses with specific optical properties , 
such as large spectral bandwidth, short  pulse duration , and high 
repetition rate. Furthermore, maintaining the long -term 
environmental stability and reproducibility of a mode -locked

develop hi gh-quality and stable pulsed fiber oscillators, robust 
pulse -picking and delicate pulse -shaping schemes are requisite.  
Previously , various saturable absorbers (SAs) have been 
developed for the use in mode -locked fiber lasers to achieve 
pulse -picking operat ion. Incorporating real SAs , such as 
semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM) [5], carbon 
nanotube (CNT) [6], graphene [7], and other two -dimensional 
(2D) materials into the laser cavity offers a convenient method 
for fabricating eas ily self-starting fiber lasers. Nevertheless, the 
potential shortcomings of SESAMs, such as complicated 
manufacturing procedures and narrow bandwidth, limit their 
use. 2D nanomaterials -based fiber lasers suffer from low 
damage thresholds and performance degradation over time [8]. 
Nonlinear polarization evolution (NPE) is an effective artificial 
SA for building  high-performance fiber lasers, whose mode -
locking mechanisms are based on nonlinear optical effects. In 
traditional NPE -based  mode -locked fiber lasers, the Kerr 
nonlinearity in weakly birefringent fiber s induces the intensity -
dependent nonlinear phase shi ft, which converts the change in 
polarization state into amplitude modulation. The high -
intensity pulses experience lower loss, which acts as a fast SA 
supporting passive mode -locking. Although NPE mode -locked 
fiber lasers have achieved superior optical pe rformance, such as 
high single -pulse energy [9], short  pulse duration  [10], and high 
repetition rate [11], the utilization of non -polarization -
maintaining (non -PM) fibers restricts their working scenarios 
and commercialization. In complex environments , where 
factors such as temperature and vibration may vary  
dramatically , the laser is likely to lose its mode -locked state, 
and the opti cal characteristics may not be maintained. An 
upgraded version of the traditional NPE technique is to 
implement NPE mode -locking in PM fibers. All-PM r ing-
cavity  and linear -cavity  fiber lasers based on NPE have been 
proposed and demonstrated by several gro ups [12]–[26]. To 
eliminate the group -velocity mismatch (GVM), the length and

splicing angle of the PM fiber pieces should be accurately 
adjusted  in the all-PM ring cavity fiber laser mode -locked by 
means of NPE. Off-axis fusion splicing s between each PM fiber 
are required to introduce SA effects into the laser cavity, which 
increases the complexity of the laser fabrication and impairs the 
stability of output characteristics. Compared to ring cavity  fiber 
lasers, the GVM caused by strong birefringence in linear  cavity 
fiber lasers can be fully  canceled by the Faraday mirror placed 
at the end of the laser cavity. In 2007, C. K. Nielsen et al. have 
designed a n all -PM linear cavity fiber laser  emitting 5.6 -ps 
ultrashort pulses at a repetition rate of 5.96 MHz [12]. S. 
Boivinet et al. have demonstrated the realization of different 
pulsed regimes in a 948 -kHz PM fiber laser mode -locked by 
means of NPE [13]. More recently, numerical modeling and 
experimental investigation have been performed in a Yb:fiber 
laser  with a linear cavity , which generates dispersion -managed 
soliton pulses with a spectral bandwidth of 37. 84 nm [26]. 
However, the fundamental repetition rate of these linear  cavity  
fiber lasers is below 10 MHz because long PM fibers are needed 
to accumulate sufficient nonlinear phase bias. The non -
reciprocal phase shifter formed by the combination of a Faraday 
rotator and wave plates is able to shift the reflectivity curve of 
SA to effectively reduce  the mode -locking threshold. By 
introducing the non -reciprocal phase shifter into the free -space 
linear arm [27] or fiber loop [28], the figure -9 fiber laser mode -
locked by nonlinear amplifying loop mirror (NALM) exhibits 
extraordinary self -starting ability  of mode -locking . The 
insertion of the non -reciprocal phase shifter prods the laser 
towards  produc ing a continuous -wave (CW) output , which 
facilitates the generatio n of high -repetition -rate and high -
energy pulse s [29], [30] . Furthermore, a self -referenced optical 
frequency comb wi th superior stability ha s been implemented 
in a NALM -based fiber laser  [31]. The optical performance of 
fiber lasers using a phase -biased NALM can be significantly 
enhanced, and this technique has also been applied to all-PM 
fiber lasers  with linear configurations . Recently , linear -cavity  
fiber  oscillators with a non-reciprocal phase shifter have been 
intensively investigated [15]–[18]. In particul ar, our group has 
simplified the structure of a n all-PM linear -cavity fiber 
oscillator , achiev ing the highest available (to the best of our 
knowledge) repetition rate , 133 MHz [18]. The laser operates at 
anomalous dispersion, an d no intra -cavity dispersion 
engineering has been used. The achievable pulse duration and 
spectral bandwidth are limited in the soliton regime . To 
promote the application range of this laser as a broad -spectrum 
light source, it is very relevant  to explore other pulsed regime s, 
such as ones producing  stretched pulse s. The implementation of  
the dispersion -engineering technique allows significant 
compression of the generated pulse s. Besides, although the 
optical characteristics of linear -cavity  fiber lasers mode -locked 
by means of NPE have been  experimentally investigated in Ref. 
[16]–[18], the influence of the position of the non -reciprocal 
phase shifter on the output characteristics is not known . 
Another motivation to study such fiber lasers is to simplify and 
optimize their laser architecture s to reduce the manufacturing 
costs and enhance the optical performance . 
In this paper, two novel linear -cavity  fiber oscillators with a simple design, using different locations of the  non-reciprocal 
phase shifter , are presented. In these setups, the NPE mo de-
locking mechanism is implemented  in all -PM fibers, enhancing 
the environmental stability of the output characteristics. Both 
laser configurations operate in the stretched pulse regime , the 
generated pulses are characterized by a large spectral 
bandwid th, short pulse duration, and high repetition rate . The 
first configuration delivers sub -200 fs stretched pulses at the 
fundamental repetition rate of 114.97 MHz. In contrast, sub -90 
fs high -peak -power pulses at 116.76 -MHz repetition rate are 
generated by the second configuration. The phase and 
amplitude noise of the proposed all-PM fiber lasers are 
measured and analyzed  in the free -running state . The 
combination of excellent optical performance, low -noise 
operation , and environmental stability make s these  linear cavity  
fiber lasers appropriate for a wide range of applications.  
II. LASER ARCHITECTURES AND THEORETICAL ANALYSIS  
Two experimental laser architectures (Laser1 and Laser2) 
that differ by the position of the non -reciprocal phase shifter are 
schematicall y illustrated in Fig s. 1(a -b). Highly reflective 
mirrors (M 1 and M2 ) at both ends of the laser cavity lend the 
PM fiber oscillator a rectilinear  structure. Both fiber oscillators 
are composed  of two free -space portions and a segment of the 
PM fiber. The latter one  is spliced by a PM erbium -doped fiber 
(Liekki Er80 -4/125 -HD-PM, PM -EDF) with normal group 
velocity dispersion (GVD) 28.0 ps2/km and length 33 cm, and 
a PM single -mode fiber (PM -SMF) with anomalous GVD 
−23.0 ps2/km at 1550 nm  and length 51 cm . The net cavity 
dispersion is ≈ −0.0025 ps2, hence the laser operates in the 
nearly-zero-GVD mode , which supports the generation of 
stretched pulse s. The active fiber is pumped by a single -mode 
semiconductor laser diode (LD) with a maximum pump power 
of 630 mW.  The Semi -wavelength division multiplexer (Semi -
WDM) employed in the laser cavity has a dual function  [18]. 
The first function is to inject the 976 nm pump light into the 
gain medium. Secondly, it  serve s as a collimator. In Laser1, the 
non-reciprocal phase shifter comprising a Faraday rotator (FR) 
and a λ/8 -wave plate (EWP) is inserted between the polarization 
beam splitter (PBS) and half -wave plate (HWP), as shown in 
the encircled  box of Fig. 1(a). Diffe rently, the EWP of Laser2 
is installed between the FR and M1, i.e., the non -reciprocal 
phase shifter is moved to the opposite end of the PM fiber, as 
shown  in the encircled  box of Fig. 1(b). Compared to Laser1, 
only one FR is required in Laser2, which grea tly simplifies the 
rectilinear  structure of the laser and reduces the manufacturing 
cost. The PBS extracts linear ly polarized pulses from the laser 
cavity.

In the all-PM laser cavities  presented above , effective 
artificial SAs play the crucial role in supporting the NPE mode -
locking mechanism. Figure 2(a) depicts the artificial SA of 
Laser1 and the evolution of the pulse p olarization states in the 
three -dimensional space. The artificial SA consists of several 
free-space elements for polarization controlling and a segment 
of PM fiber serving as the Kerr medium. The mode -locking 
mechanism relies on the nonlinear propagation of orthogonally 
polarized pulses with unequal intensity along the fast and slow 
axes of the PM fiber. The non -reciprocal phase shifter 
incorporated into the artificial SA plays a significant role in the 
linear cavity  fiber laser. The function  of the shifter  is to modify 
the reflectivity , so that its nonzero value and a non -vanishing 
slope at zero phase difference are provided , to maintain 
appropriate  self-starting capabilities and reduce  the mode -
locking threshold for the rectilinear  cavity  fiber laser [15]–[18]. 
Another essential point is that the combination of a 45 -degree 
rotation FR and th e end mirror provides  the 90-degree rotation 
of the orthogonally polarized pulses. Consequently, when the 
reflected orthogonal pulses pass through the PM fiber again, the 
GVM effect introduced by the strong birefringence of the PM 
fiber can be fully  remove d. The artificial SA of Laser2 with a 
simpler structure is presented in Fig. 2(b).

Although the two SAs shown in Figs. 2(a -b) have similar 
structures, it is expected  that the difference in the position of the 
non-reciprocal phase shifter has a gr eat influence on the 
modulation depth, saturable losses, modulation period , etc. 
Because in SA1, the orthogonally polarized pulses are phase -
biased after two passes through the PM fiber, while in SA2, they 
are phase -biased  with only a single pass through t he PM fiber. 
To figure out the difference between the two SAs and gain deeper  understanding of the pulse -picking mechanism of each 
SA, a theoretical calculation of the artificial SA reflectivity , as 
a function of the nonlinear phase shift , should be performed. 
The effect of each optical element on the polarized pulse can be 
represented by Jones matrices as a linear transformation [32]. 
The matrices f or each optical device shown in Fig. 2 are given  
in Table 1. The nonlinear phase shift for the orthogonal pulses 
double -propagating through the PM fiber is defined as ∆φnl, 
which is mainly contributed  to by the self-phase modulation 
(SPM) and cross -phase m odulation (XPM) [21]. The 
accumulation of the nonlinear phase shift follows the relation: 
∆φnl = ∆φnl1 + ∆φnl2, where ∆φnl1 and ∆φnl2 represent the 
nonlinear phase shift of the pulses entering and leaving the PM 
fiber, respectively.

The PBS is set as the starting point of the incident pulse. 
After passing through the PBS, the polarization state of the 
incident pulse can be expressed by a normalized field vector ex 
= (1, 0). The subsequent transmission of the pulses through the 
polarization -controlling optics and PM fiber is represented  by 
simple matrix multiplication. As a result, the transformation of 
the pulses’ electric field , Etrans1 = (Ex1, Ey1), in the course of  the

be calculated as follows,

                                       (3) 
It follows from Eq. (3) that the change of the reflectivity curve  
is determined by the rotation angle of the wave plates ( θh and 
θe) and the nonlinear phase shift ( ∆φnl). Figure s 3(a-d) show  the 
accordingly calculated  normalized reflectivity of SA1 as a 
function of the nonlinear phase shift  for different wave -plate 
rotations . Note that if the value of the reflectivity function at 
zero nonlinear phase shift has a nonzero value and, more 
importantly, it exhibits a non -vanishing slope, the build -up of 
pulses from noise at low power is facilitated [33]. Operatio n 
points marked by hollow black circles in all the figures 
represent the position on the curve where the phase bias is 
applied to the artificial SA. When  the rotation angle of the EWP 
is adjusted to 0º , 15º , 30º , and 45º , the respective number of the 
reflectivity curves with phase biases shows a trend to the 
increase , viz., 2, 3, 4, and 6, respectively. Figure s 3(a-c) 
demonstrate the cyclicity and symmetry of the reflectivity 
curves. The blue and red curves corresponding to HWP rotation 
angles of 0º  and 45º , respectively, are identical and feature no 
periodic modulation , indicating that the reflectivity curve is 
cycled with the 45º  rotation of the HWP as a cycle. Curves of 
different  colors in Fig. 3 are mirror -symmetrically distributed 
around the cyan one. In Fig s. 3(a-c), most reflectivity curves 
have a modulation period of 4π, while the other cyan curve , 
representin g the HWP rotation angle of 22.5º , has a modulation 
period of 2π. Figure 3(d) show s the case where the rotation 
angle of the EWP is adjusted to 45º , that is, after the 
orthogonally polarized pulses are rotated 45º  by the FR, their 
polarization states corre spond to the fast and slow axes of the 
EWP. In this case, changing  the angle of the HWP affects only 
the modulation depth at a fixed phase bias (π/2) and the 
modulation period (2π).

for different wave -plate angles, θh and θe. (a)-(c) θe = 0º , 15º , and 30º . Tuning 
angle θh affects the modulation depth, phase bias, and modulation period . (d) In 
the case of θe = 45º , tuning angle θh affects only  the modulation depth , with a 
fixed nonlinear phase shift of π/2.  
In compar ison to SA1, setup SA2 exhibits very different  
reflectivity properties, as shown in Fig s. 4(a-d). In Fig. 4(a), the 
rotation angle of the EWP is set to 0º , while the rotation angle of the HWP increases  from 0º  to 22.5º  in steps of 3.75º . It is 
found that the corresponding reflectivity curve exhibits the 
modulation depth decreasing from 100% to 0%, and no phase 
bias is observed. The red curve at θh = 22.5º  indicates no 
reflectivity modulation, the pulses being totally reflected. To 
adjust the value and slope of the reflectivity curve at zero phase 
difference, the EWP rotating angle is switched to 15º , 30º , and 
45º. The respective changes in the reflectivity are obtained  by 
altering the HWP rotating angle from 0º  to 45º , as shown in  Figs. 
4(b-d). At a fixed rotation angle of EWP, the modulation depth 
of the SA decreases with an increase in θh from 0º  to 22.5º . An 
extreme example , shown in Fig. 4(d),  is the case where the 
rotation angle s of the EWP and HWP are both 45º , the 
modulation depth attains  100%, and the nonlinear phase shift is 
exactly π/2, leading to a maximum slope of the entire  
reflectivity curve. It is seen from the above analysis that any 
desired modulation de pth and phase bias can be obtained by 
adjusting the rotation angle of HWP and EWP, corroborating  
that the so-designed SA possesses the capability of reliable and 
reproducible  pulse -picking.

bias. 
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  
A. Characteristics of Pulses Produced by Mode -locked 
Laser1  
Self-starting mode -locking can be achieved by appropriately 
fine-tuning the positions of the two wave  plates and raising the 
pump p ower to a sufficiently high value. At high powers, 
spectra with CW components or multi -pulsing emerge . 
Gradually reducing the pump power is required to maintain  
stable emission of  clean pulses. At the mode -locking threshold 
of 530 mW, Laser1 switches from the CW operation to the 
pulsed mode . When the pump power is decreased from 280 mW 
to 200 mW, the average output power of the generated 
individual  pulse drops from 7.71 mW to 1.56 mW. The spectral 
and temporal diagnostics of the generated pulses measured at  
the pump power of 280 mW are produced  in Fig. 5. As shown

in Fig. 5(a), the spectrum measured by an optical spectrum 
analyzer (AQ6370D Yokogawa) is highly structured and 
features several intensity spikes in the central part.  The 
sidebands on both sides of  the spectrum are inconsistent with 
the typical spectral features of stretched pulses . The PM fiber 
can be designed  as a Lyot filter based on the birefringence effect.  
By adjusting the polarization state of the pulse and the length of 
the PM fiber, the modulation depth and spectral modulation 
interval of the filter are tunable [34]. This principle is utilized  
to realize dual -wavelength mode -locking in a figure -9 PM fiber 
laser  [35]. Furthermore , the insertion  of PM fiber s into ultrafast 
lasers can introduce strong birefringence -induced phase -
matching , which affects the temporal and spectral 
characteristics  of the generated pulses [36], [37] . Therefore, the 
NPE mode -locking mechanism implemented in PM fibers 
induces the observed spectral sideband s. The pulse’s spectral 
full width at half -maximum (FWHM) is 32.9 nm, which is 
broader than  the conventional soliton spectr um. A radio -
frequency (RF) signal analyzer (N9030B, Agilent) with a 
bandwidth from 3 to 50 GHz is utilized to record the 
fundamental RF spectrum and its harmonics, presented in Fig. 
5(b). The fundamental frequency peak cente red at 114.967 
MHz exhibits a high signal -to-noise ratio (SNR) of 73.5 dB 
with a resolution bandwidth of 10 kHz. The inset of Fig. 5(b) 
shows the harmonic RF spectra with a span range of 1 GHz, 
demonstrating good mode -locking performance and stable 
single -pulse operation. The temporal traces of mode -locked 
pulses are explored  by an oscilloscope (Keysight, DSO -X 
6004A) with the help of  a 3 GHz bandwidth InGaAs 
photodetector. As illustrated in Fig. 5(c), the pulse interval is 
8.70 ns, which is determined by t he pulse propagating forth and 
back in the PM fiber and free space of the linear laser cavity. 
The oscilloscope screenshot in an expanded time window (20 
ms/div) indicates that the pulse train is free of Q -switched 
modulation. The output pulse is directly injected from the PBS 
into a commercial autocorrelator (APE PulseCheck,  150) to 
measure autocorrelation traces. Fig. 5(d) shows the fringe -
resolved and intensity autocorrelation (inset) trace s. The pulse 
duration is estimated to be 157 fs , assuming  the sec h pulse ’s 
profile. Two parasitic sidelobes appear  on both sides of the 
autocorrelation trace, which is mainly caused by the highly 
structured spectrum.  The interval between fringes shown in Fig. 
5 (d) is 0.78 ps, corresponding to the  Fourier transform of the 
spectral spacing  of 10.3 nm between the intensity spikes  [38].

its harmonics (inset); (c) The pulse train and oscilloscope screenshot on the 
large time scale (inset). (d) Fringe -resolved and intensity autocorrelation  trace s

Intensity -dependent nonlinear effects such as SPM have a 
profound impact on the spectral band width and structure of the 
mode -locked pulses. We have investigated the spectra and 
autocorrelation traces at different pump powers. The spectral 
FWHM and shape exhibit specific features, in compar ison to 
dissipative -soliton and similariton fiber lasers [39], [40] . As 
depicted in Fig. 6(b), when the pump powe r is below 220 mW, 
two dominant high -intensity spikes at short wavelengths 
correspond to the spectral FWHM below 20 nm. Increasing the 
pump power above 240 mW results in stronger spectral spikes 
at long wavelengths and a weak er first spectral spike at shor t 
wavelengths. Consequently, the spectrum is broadened beyond 
30 nm, and the intensity center of the spectrum exhibits  a 
redshift. The apparent broadening of the spectrum results in 
slight narrowing of the pulse duration from 176 fs to 157 fs, as 
shown in Fig. 6(c). Besides, the parasitic sidelobes on both sides 
of the autocorrelation trace become indistinct, indicating 
enhancement of the pulse quality. According to Fig s. 6(b -c), 
with an increase of the pump power from 200 mW to 280 mW, 
the time -bandwidth p roducts (TBPs) are computed to be 0.375, 
0.364, 0.658, 0.650, and 0.632, respectively. The pulses at low 
pump powers approach the Fourier transform limit. Trends of 
the variation of the average output power, peak power, spectral 
FWHM , and pulse duration of the generated pulses are 
summarized, as function s of the pump power , in Fig. 6(a). The 
maximum output power is 7.71 mW, corresponding to the 
single -pulse energy of 67.1 pJ and peak power of 427 W.

Well -designed fiber lasers delivering stretched pulses should 
feature low timing jitter, which strongly depends on the pulse 
formation mechanism [41]. Furthermore, all -PM fiber 
oscillators are highly sought for constructing low -noise optical 
frequency combs [42], [43] . The all-PM fiber laser proposed

here combine s the advantages of both a robust laser cavity and 
an advantageous pulse -shaping mechanism. A phase noise 
analyzer (Rohde & Schwarz, FSWP8) is employed to 
characterize the phase and amplitude noise performance when 
the fiber laser operates in the  free-running mode,  without any 
noise suppression. The InGaAs photodetector converts a few 
milliwatts of pulsed light into RF signals that are fed direc tly 
into the phase noise analyzer. The phase noise power spectral 
density (PSD) and the corresponding integrated phase noise are 
presented in Fig.7(a). In the frequency range from 10 Hz to 2.3 
kHz, the phase noise value ranges  between -60 and -140 dBc/Hz. 
The observed spikes are caused by the effect of environmental 
fluctuations on the laser and the intrinsic noise of the 
photodetector . The noise spectrum then slowly drops to a 
minimum value of -167 dBc/Hz , in the frequency range from 
2.3 kHz to 400 kHz. Th e phase noise curve ends up maintaining 
the lowest value in the high -frequency range. The green curve 
displays the integration of the phase noise PSD, producing  the 
timing jitter of 284 fs integrated from 100 kHz to 10 MHz. 
Figure 7(b) shows that the relat ive intensity noise (RIN) curve 
gradually decreases at the 1 kHz offset frequency until it 
reaches -150 dBc/Hz. Multiple peaks in the frequency range 
from 10 Hz to 1 kHz are attributed to acoustic noise and 
mechanical vibrations [44]. Integrating the entire frequency 
range from 10 Hz to 10 MHz yields the integrated RIN of 
0.0224%.

B. Characteristics of Pulses Produced by Mode -locked 
Laser2  
Laser2 is constructed with fewer optics, making this setup  
simpler and more compact. The  compactification of the free -
space part is beneficial to reduce the coupling loss of the Semi -
WDM and increase the repetition rate of the generated pulses . 
According to the discussion and analysis in Section 2, the 
position of the non -reciprocal phase shifter , adopted in the 
structure of Laser2,  significantly changes the modulation depth, 
phase bias, and modulation period of the reflectivity curve, 
thereby affecting the evolution of the orthogonally polarized 
pulses in t he laser cavity. Laser2 enters pulsed operation in the 
mode -locked state at the pump power of 380 mW, which is 
lower than the self -starting mode -locking threshold of Laser1. 
Clean single -pulse operation emerges  for the pump powers 
ranging from 170 mW to 25 0 mW. Figure 8 show s the basic 
lasing performance of Laser2 at the 250 -mW pump power. 
Compared to Fig. 5(a), the spectrum shown in Fig. 8(a) exhibits 
similar features, that is, several spectral spikes in the central part 
and sidebands on both sides of the spectrum . The spectral 
sidebands may be eliminated by recently developed techniques 
such as soliton distillation [45], [46] . The difference is that the three ma in spectral spikes correspond to a wider spectral 
FWHM of 44.5 nm. Fig ure 8(b) shows that the measured RF 
spectrum is centered at the fundamental repetition rate of 
116.757 MHz, corresponding to a pulse interval of 8.56 ns [Fig. 
8(c)]. An SNR of 78.6 dB is  demonstrated, which is higher than 
the case in Laser1. This is mainly attributed to  the simpler 
cavity structure of Laser2 . Accordingly, the generated pulses  
possess better time -frequency domain properties . The pulse 
duration , directly measured at the out put port , is 90 fs , without 
any dispersion compensation, as shown in Fig. 8(d). Parasitic 
sidelobes on both sides of the autocorrelation trace almost 
disappear, implying better pulse quality than provided by 
Laser1.

its harmonics (inset); (c) The pulse train and oscilloscope screenshot on the 
large time scale (inset). (d) The fringe -resolved and i ntensity autocorrelation  
trace s (inset) . 
Compared with Laser1, the stretched pulse generated by 
Laser2 exhibits significantly different optical properties, as 
shown in Fig. 9(a). Varying the pump power from 250 mW to 
170 mW corresponds to a linear drop of the average output 
power from 19.16 mW to 10.75 mW, which is more than twice 
the average output power of Laser1. Further, i n comparison  to 
Laser1 , the output pulse of Laser2 characterizes  a wider spectral 
band width and a narrower pulse duration, resulting in a nearly 
fourfold increase in the peak power. The maximum output 
power and peak power achieved in Laser2 are 19.16 mW and 
1824.2 W, respectively. Figure s 9(b-c) show the effects  of the 
pump power on spectral and temporal characteristics of 
stretched pul ses delivered by Laser2. The spectral FWHM is 
mainly contributed to by three high -intensity spectral spikes. 
The middle -intensity spike exhibits a  blue shift, following the  
increas e of the  pump power. At the pump power of 190 mW , 
Laser2 emits stretched pulses with a maximum spectral FWHM  
of 50.4 nm and the narrowest pulse duration of 79 fs, which is 
the shortest for known  PM fiber lasers mode -locked by means 
of NPE. The calculated TBPs are 0.350, 0.487, 0.483, 0.483, 
0.490 at pum p powers from 170 mW to 250 mW, respectively. 
The case at 170 -mW pump power is close to the Fourier 
transform limit value of 0.315.

Laser2. (a) The average output power, peak  power, pulse duration, and spectral 
FWHM  as function s of pump power; (b) Optical spectra at different pump 
powers; (c) Autocorrelation traces at different pump powers.  
The phase -noise spectrum and the corresponding integration 
are plotted in Fig. 10(a). The phase -noise curve has 
characteristics similar to those produced by  Laser1. The timing 
jitter , integrated from 100 kHz to 10 MHz offset frequency, is 
209 fs, which is lower than the value produced by  Laser1.  
Figure 10(b) presents the RIN spectrum, which  ranges  between 
-110 and -160 dBc/Hz. Overall, the RIN level of Laser2 is lower 
than that of Laser1, achieving an integrated RIN of 0.0109% in 
the range of 10 Hz -10 MHz.  It has been  predicted that short 
pulse duration and close -to-zero intracavity dispersion can 
reduce the timing jitter induced by the amplified spontaneous 
emission (ASE) noise [47], [48] . In dispersion -managed fiber 
lasers, the generated pulse stretches and compresses as it travels 
through the laser cavity. The two intracavity positions with the 
shortest pulse durations are in the middle of the normal - and 
anomalous -dispersion fiber  segments  [4]. These two positions 
correspond to the two ends of the PM fi ber of the proposed 
linear -cavity fiber laser. It is reasonable to conjecture  that the 
pulse extracted at the PBS characterizes a shorter pulse duration 
than other positions. Therefore, the stability against the noise is 
more favorable at the PBS than at o ther positions.

(a) The phase noise PSD and the corresponding integrated phase noise; (b) The 
RIN PSD and the corresponding integrated RIN.  
The pulse -performance characteristics  of Laser1 and Laser2  
are compared in Table 2. It is obvious that the characteristics of 
Laser2 are superior to those of Laser1 in terms of the pulse energy, quality, and noise level. The reason is mainly due to the 
difference in the evolution of the orthogonally polarized pulses 
in the two laser setups , which directly leads to the differential 
pulse selection  by the proposed NPE SAs. In addition, Laser 2 
has a simpler structure that uses one fewer  FR, which is 
beneficial for reducing the intra-cavity loss and increasing the 
single -pulse energy. Therefore, the peak power of the stretched 
pulses delivered by Laser2 is much higher than that of Laser1. 
The s tretched pulses produced  by Laser2 exhibit  better optical 
properties and negligible pulse sidelobes in autocorrelation 
traces, which contribute to better noise characteristics.  It is 
natural to consider  whether the proposed fiber lasers can 
achieve a highe r pulse repetition rate or a shorter pulse duration . 
The method to increase the pulse repetition rate is to use high -
gain PM fiber s or adopt bidirectional pumping  to enhance the 
CW intensity . Achieving  a shorter pulse duration requires more 
precise control  of the intracavity dispersion map.

IV. CONCLUSIONS  
We have demonstrated the operation of two all-PM linear 
cavity fiber -laser  setups (Laser1 and Laser2), which operate in 
the mode -locked regime maintained by two novel NPE SAs 
(saturable absorbers) with a simple struc ture. The SA 
reflectivity as a function of the nonlinear phase shift is 
theoretically analyzed to investigate the pulse evolution and 
mode -locking mechanism. Both setups generate stretched 
pulse s, in the parameter region which supports accurately 
adjusted dispersion engineering.  At the pump power of 280 mW, 
Laser1 generates ultrashort pulses with temporal duration 157 
fs and energy 67.1 pJ, at the repetition rate of 114.97 MHz. The 
stretched pulses delivered by Laser2 exhibit  a wider spectral 
bandwidth, shorter pulse duration, and higher single -pulse 
energy. To the best of our knowledge, the shortest pulse 
duration 79 fs, produced by  Laser2, is the smallest value 
provided  by PM fiber lasers mode -locked by means of NPE. 
The achieved superior optical character istics , along  with the 
environmental stability , make the proposed seed oscillators 
highly  attractive for many applications , such as optical 
frequency comb generation, ranging, and imaging.
