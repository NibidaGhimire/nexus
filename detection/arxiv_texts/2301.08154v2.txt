KDV BREATHERS ON A CNOIDAL WAVE BACKGROUND
MARK HOEFER, ANA MUCALICA, AND DMITRY E. PELINOVSKY
Abstract. Using the Darboux transformation for the Korteweg-de Vries equation,
we construct and analyze exact solutions describing the interaction of a solitary wave
and a traveling cnoidal wave. Due to their unsteady, wavepacket-like character, these
wave patterns are referred to as breathers. Both elevation (bright) and depression
(dark) breather solutions are obtained. The nonlinear dispersion relations demon-
strate that the bright (dark) breathers propagate faster (slower) than the background
cnoidal wave. Two-soliton solutions are obtained in the limit of degeneration of the
cnoidal wave. In the small amplitude regime, the dark breathers are accurately ap-
proximated by dark soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schr odinger equation. These
results provide insight into recent experiments on soliton-dispersive shock wave inter-
actions and soliton gases.
1.Introduction
The localized and periodic traveling wave solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)
equation are so ubiquitous and fundamental to nonlinear science that their names,
\soliton" and \cnoidal wave," have achieved a much broader usage, representing local-
ized and periodically extended traveling wave solutions across a wide range of nonlinear
evolutionary equations. Consequently, it is natural and important to consider their in-
teractions. While the traditional notion of linear superposition cannot be used, the
complete integrability of the KdV equation implies a nonlinear superposition princi-
ple. For example, soliton interactions can be described by exact N-soliton solutions,
which can be constructed by successive Darboux transformations [1]. By utilizing solu-
tions of the spectral problem for the stationary Schr odinger equation and the temporal
evolution equation whose compatibility is equivalent to solving the KdV equation,
the Darboux transformation achieves a nonlinear superposition principle by eectively
\adding" one soliton to the base solution. In the spectral problem, the soliton appears
as an additional eigenvalue that is added to the spectrum of the base solution.
Compared to soliton interactions, soliton-cnoidal wave interactions have not been
explored in as much detail. The purpose of this paper is to apply the Darboux trans-
formation to the cnoidal wave solution of the KdV equation in order to obtain the
nonlinear superposition of a single soliton and a cnoidal wave. These exact solutions,
expressed in terms of Jacobi theta functions and elliptic integrals, represent the inter-
actions of a soliton and a cnoidal wave.

The motivation for this study comes from recent experiments and analysis of the
interaction of solitons and dispersive shock waves (DSWs) [2, 3, 4]. The DSWs can be
viewed as modulated cnoidal waves [5, 6] so that soliton-DSW interaction is analogous
to soliton-cnoidal wave interaction. Two dierent types of soliton-DSW interaction
dynamics were observed in [2]. When a soliton completely passes through a DSW, the
nature of the interaction gives rise to an elevation (bright) nonlinear wavepacket. When
a soliton becomes embedded or trapped within a DSW, the trapped soliton resembles
a depression (dark) nonlinear wavepacket. Similar transmission and trapping scenarios
were analyzed for solitons interacting with rarefaction waves [7, 8].
Breathers are localized, unsteady solutions that exhibit two distinct time scales or
velocities; one associated with propagation and the other with internal oscillations.
A canonical model equation that admits breather solutions is the focusing modied
Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation. These solutions can be interpreted as bound
states of two soliton solutions [9, 10]. It is in a similar spirit that we regard as a breather,
the soliton-cnoidal wave interactions considered here. Such wavepacket solutions are
propagating, nonlinear solutions with internal oscillations.
Among our main results, we nd two distinct varieties of exact solutions of the KdV
equation, corresponding to elevation (bright) or depression (dark) breathers interact-
ing with the cnoidal wave background. These breathers are topological because they
impart a phase shift to the cnoidal wave. We show that bright breathers propagate
faster than the cnoidal wave, whereas dark breathers move slower. Furthermore, bright
breathers of suciently small amplitude exhibit a negative phase shift, whereas bright
breathers of suciently large amplitude exhibit a positive phase shift. On the other
hand, dark breathers with the strongest localization have a positive phase shift. Small
amplitude dark breathers can exhibit either a negative or positive phase shift. Each
breather solution is characterized by its position and a spectral parameter, determin-
ing a nonlinear dispersion relation, which uniquely relates the breather velocity to the
breather phase shift.
Exact solutions representing soliton-cnoidal wave interactions have previously been
constructed using other solution methods. The rst result was developed in [11] within
the context of the stability analysis of a cnoidal wave of the KdV equation. The authors
used the Marchenko equation of the inverse scattering transform and obtained exact
solutions for \dislocations" of the cnoidal wave. More special solutions for soliton-
cnoidal wave interactions were obtained in [12] by using the nonlocal symmetries of
the KdV equation. These solutions are expressed in a closed form as integrals of
Jacobi elliptic functions, but they do not represent the most general exact solutions
for soliton-cnoidal wave interactions.
Quasi-periodic (nite-gap) solutions and solitons on a quasi-periodic background
have been obtained as exact solutions of the KdV equation by using algebro-geometric
methods [13, 14]. In the limit of a single gap, such solutions describe interactions of
solitons with a cnoidal wave. By using the degeneration of hyperelliptic curves andKDV BREATHERS 3
Sato Grassmannian theory, mixing between solitons and quasi-periodic solutions was
obtained recently in [15] based on [16], not only for the KdV equation but also for the
KP hierarchy of integrable equations. Finally, in a very recent preprint [17], inspired
by recent works on soliton gases [18, 19], the degeneration of quasi-periodic solutions
was used to construct multisoliton-cnoidal wave interaction solutions.
Compared to previous work, which primarily involve Weierstrass functions with com-
plex translation parameters, we give explicit solutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic func-
tions with real-valued parameters. This approach allows us to clarify the nature of
soliton-cnoidal wave interactions, plot their corresponding properties, and analyze the
exact solutions in various limiting regimes. We also demonstrate that the Darboux
transformation provides a more straightforward method for obtaining these compli-
cated interaction solutions compared to the degeneration methods used in [15, 17].
The paper is organized as follows. The main results are formulated in Section 2
and illustrated graphically. In Section 3, we introduce the normalized cnoidal wave
solution with one parameter. Symmetries of the KdV equation are then introduced
that can be used to generate the more general family of cnoidal waves with four ar-
bitrary parameters. Eigenfunctions of the stationary Schr odinger equation with the
normalized cnoidal wave potential are reviewed in Section 4. The time evolution of
the eigenfunctions is obtained in Section 5. In Section 6, the Darboux transformation
is used to generate breather solutions to the KdV equation. Properties of bright and
dark breathers are explored in Sections 7 and 8, respectively. The paper concludes
with Section 9.
2.Main results
We take the Korteweg{de Vries (KdV) equation in the normalized form
ut+ 6uux+uxxx= 0; (1)
wheretis the evolution time, xis the spatial coordinate for wave propagation, and u
is the uid velocity. As is well-known [20], every smooth solution u(x;t) of the KdV
equation (1) is the compatibility condition of the stationary Schr odinger equation
( @2
x u)v=v (2)
and the time evolution problem
vt= (4 2u)vx+uxv; (3)
whereis the (x;t)-independent spectral parameter.
The normalized traveling cnoidal wave of the KdV equation (1) is given by
u(x;t) =0(x c0t);  0(x) := 2k2cn2(x;k); c 0:= 4(2k2 1); (4)
where cn(x;k) is the Jacobi elliptic function, and k2(0;1) is the elliptic modulus.
Table 1 collects together elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions used in our
work, see [21, 22, 23].4 MARK HOEFER, ANA MUCALICA, AND DMITRY E. PELINOVSKY
The main result of this work is the derivation and analysis of two solution families of
the KdV equation (1) parametrized by andx02R, wherebelongs to ( 1; k2)
for the rst family and (1  2k2;1 k2) for the second family. Both the solution families
can be expressed in the form
u(x;t) = 2
k2 1 +E(k)
K(k)
+ 2@2
xlog(x;t); (5)
where the-function for the rst family is given by
(x;t) := (x c0t+b)eb(x cbt+x0)+ (x c0t b)e b(x cbt+x0)(6)
with uniquely dened b>0,cb> c 0andb2(0;K(k)) and the -function for the
second family is given by
(x;t) := (x c0t+d)e d(x cdt+x0)+ (x c0t d)ed(x cdt+x0)(7)
with uniquely dened d>0,cd<c0, andd2(0;K(k)).
Figure 1 depicts the spatiotemporal evolution of a solution u(x;t) given by (5) and
(6). This solution represents a bright breather on a cnoidal wave background (hereafter
referred to as a bright breather) with speed cb> c 0and inverse width b, wherec0is
the speed of the background cnoidal wave. As a result of the bright soliton, the cnoidal
wave background is spatially shifted by  2b.

andx0= 0.
Figure 2 shows the spatiotemporal evolution of a solution u(x;t) given by (5) and
(7). This solution is a dark breather on a cnoidal wave background (hereafter referred
to as a dark breather), where the breather core exhibits the inverse spatial width d
and speedcd<c0. The dark breather gives rise to the spatial shift 2 dof the cnoidal
background.KDV BREATHERS 5

andx0= 0.
Using properties of Jacobi elliptic functions, we obtain explicit expressions for the
parameters of the -functions (6) and (7) and their dependence on the parameter 
that characterizes the dynamical properties of bright and dark breathers. Although
the analytical expressions (5) with either (6) or (7) are not novel and can be found in
equivalent forms in [11, 15, 17], it is the rst time to the best of our knowledge that
the dynamical properties of bright and dark breathers have been explicitly investigated
for the KdV equation (1). We also obtain asymptotic expressions for bright and dark
breathers in the limits when approaches the band edges or when the elliptic modulus
kapproaches the end points 0 and 1.
3.Traveling cnoidal wave
A traveling wave solution u(x;t) =(x ct) to the KdV equation (1) satises the
second-order dierential equation after integration in x:
00+ 32 c=b; (8)
whereb2Ris the integration constant and the single variable xstands forx ct. The
second-order equation (8) is integrable with the rst-order invariant
(0)2+ 23 c2 2b=d; (9)
whered2Ris another integration constant. The following proposition summarizes
the existence of periodic solutions to system (8) and (9).
Proposition 1. There exists a family of periodic solutions to system (8) and (9) for
every (b;c;d )satisfyingc2+ 12b >0andd2(U(+);U( )), whereU() := 23 
c2 2bandare critical points of Ugiven by= (cp
c2+ 12b)=6.6 MARK HOEFER, ANA MUCALICA, AND DMITRY E. PELINOVSKY
Proof. Ifc2+ 12b > 0, the mapping 7!U() has two critical points . Since
U0() = 62
 2c 2b= 0 andU00() = 12 2c=2p
c2+ 12b,+is the
minimum of Uand is the maximum of U. Ifd=U(+), the only bounded solution
of system (8) and (9) is a constant solution corresponding to the center point ( +;0).
Ifd=U( ), the only bounded solution of system (8) and (9) is a homoclinic orbit
from the saddle point (  ;0) which surrounds the center point ( +;0). The family of
periodic orbits exists in a punctured neighbourhood around the center point enclosed
by the homoclinic orbit, for d2(U(+);U( )).
Ifc2+ 12b0, the mapping 7!U() is monotonically increasing. There exist no
bounded solutions of system (8) and (9) with the exception of the constant solution
=c=6 in the marginal case c2+ 12b= 0. 
It follows from Proposition 1 that the most general periodic traveling wave solution
has three parameters ( b;c;d ), up to translations, that are dened in a subset of R3for
whichc2+ 12b >0 andd2(U(+);U( )). For each ( b;c;d ) in this subset of R3,
the translational parameter x02Rgenerates the family of solutions (x+x0) due to
translation symmetry.
Two of the three parameters of the periodic solution family can be chosen arbitrarily
due to the following two symmetries of the KdV equation (1):
Scaling transformation: if u(x;t) is a solution, so is 2u(x;3t),>0.
Galilean transformation: if u(x;t) is a solution, so is +u(x 6t;t),2R.
Due to these symmetries, if 0is a periodic solution to system (8) and (9) with ( b;c;d ) =
(b0;c0;d0), then+20(x) is also a periodic solution to system (8) and (9) with
(b;c;d ) = ( 32 2c0+4b0;6+2c0;23+22c0 24b0+6d0);
where > 0 and2Rare arbitrary parameters. Thus, without loss of general-
ity, we can consider the normalized, 1-parameter family of periodic traveling waves
0(x) = 2k2cn2(x;k) for which the values of ( b0;c0;d0) are determined in the following
proposition.
Proposition 2. The normalized cnoidal wave 0(x) = 2k2cn2(x;k)is a periodic solu-
tion of system (8) and (9) with
b0:= 4k2(1 k2); c 0:= 4(2k2 1); d 0= 0;
wherek2(0;1)is an arbitrary parameter.
Proof. Since min
x2R0(x) = 0, it follows from (9) that d0=U(0) = 0. On the other hand,
by using the following fundamental relations between Jacobi elliptic functions
sn2(x;k) + cn2(x;k) = 1;dn2(x;k) +k2sn2(x;k) = 1 (10)KDV BREATHERS 7

we obtain from (9) with d0= 0 thatb0= 4k2(1 k2) andc0= 4(2k2 1). 
4.Lame equation as the spectral problem
The spectral problem (2) with the normalized cnoidal wave (4) is known as the Lam e
equation [24, p.395]. It can be written in the form
v00(x) 2k2sn2(x;k)v(x) +v(x) = 0;  :=+ 2k2; (12)
where the single variable xstands for x c0t. By using (10) and (11), we obtain
the following three particular solutions v=v1;2;3(x) of the Lam e equation (12) with
=1;2;3(k):
1(k) := k2; v 1(x) := dn(x;k);
2(k) := 1 2k2; v 2(x) := cn(x;k);
3(k) := 1 k2; v 3(x) := sn(x;k);
which correspond to the three remarkable values of :1=k2,2= 1, and3= 1+k2.
Fork2(0;1), the three eigenvalues are sorted as 1(k)< 2(k)< 3(k).
Figure 3. Floquet spectrum of the Lam e equation (12) for dierent
values ofk2(0;1).
Figure 3 shows the Floquet spectrum of the Lam e equation (12), which corresponds
to the admissible values of for whichv2L1(R). The bands are shaded and the
band edges shown by the bold solid curves corresponding to =1;2;3(k) fork2(0;1).8 MARK HOEFER, ANA MUCALICA, AND DMITRY E. PELINOVSKY
The cnoidal wave is the periodic potential with a single nite gap (the so-called one-
zone potential) [25] so that the Floquet spectrum consists of the single nite band
[1(k);2(k)] and the semi-innite band [ 3(k);1).
As is well-known (see [24, p. 395]), the two linearly independent solutions of the
Lam e equation (12) for 6=1;2;3(k) are given by the functions
v(x) =H(x)
(x)exZ(); (13)
where2Cis found from 2Rby using the characteristic equation =k2+dn2(;k)
and the Jacobi zeta function is Z() :=0()
()=Z(';k) with'= am(;k) [21,
144.01], see Table 1. Since =+ 2k2, the characteristic equation can be written in
the form
= 1 2k2+k2cn2(;k): (14)
The following proposition claries how is dened from the characteristic equation
(14) whenis decreased from 3(k) to 1. Figure 4 illustrates the path of in the
complex plane.

Proposition 3. Fixk2(0;1). We have

Proof. When2[2(k);3(k)], it follows from (14) that cn2(;k)2[0;1] and hence
2[0;K(k)] modK(k). Solving (14) for sin '= sn(;k) using (10) yields (15). As
is decreased from 3(k) to2(k),'is monotonically increasing from 0 to =2 and
so=F(';k) monotonically increases from 0 to K(k). See the orange and blue dots
in Figure 4.
When2[1(k);2(k)], we use the special relations (see [22, 8.151 and 8.153]),
cn(K(k) +i;k) = k0sn(i;k)
dn(i;k)= ik0sn(;k0)
dn(;k0);
wherek0:=p
1 k2. The characteristic equation (14) is rewritten in the form
sn2(;k0) =1 2k2 
(1 k2)(1 k2 );
from which it follows that sn2(;k0)2[0;1] and hence 2[0;K(k0)] modK(k0).
Setting sin'= sn(;k0) yields (16). When is decreased from 2(k) to1(k), then
'is monotone increasing and so is F(';k0). Hence,increases from 0 to K0(k). See
blue and green dots on Figure 4.
When2( 1;1(k)], we use the special relations (see [22, 8.151]),
cn(K(k) +iK0(k) +) = ik0
kcn(;k);
and rewrite the characteristic equation (14) in the form
cn2(;k) =1 k2
1 2k2 :
from which it follows that cn2(;k)2[0;1] and hence 2[0;K(k)) modK(k). Setting
sin'= sn(;k) and using (10) yield (17). When is decreased from 1(k) to 1,
then'is monotone increasing and so is F(';k). Hence,increases from 0 to K(k).

5.Time evolution of the eigenfunctions
Letu(x;t) =0(x c0t) be the normalized cnoidal wave (4) and v(x;t) =v(x;t)
be solutions of the system (2) and (3) such that v(x;0) =v(x) is given by (13). The
time dependence of v(x;t) can be found by separation of variables:
v(x;t) =H(x c0t)
(x c0t)e(x c0t)Z()t!(); (18)
where!() is to be found. After substituting (18) into (3) and dividing by v(x;t),
we obtain
!() = (c0+ 4 20(x))
Z()Z(x)H0(x)
H(x)
0

wherexstands again for x ct. Equation (19) holds for every x2Rdue to the
compatibility of the system (2) and (3). Hence, we obtain !() by substituting c0=
4(2k2 1) and evaluating (19) at x= 0:
!() = 4(+k2 1)0()

; (20)
where we have used the parity properties [22, 8.192]:
H( x) = H(x) and ( x) = (x):
The following proposition ensures that !() is real when is taken either in the semi-
innite gap ( 1;1(k)) or in the nite gap ( 2(k);3(k)).

6.New solutions via the Darboux transformation
We use the standard tool of the one-fold Darboux transformation for the KdV equa-
tion [1]. If we x a value of =0and obtain a solution v=v0(x;t) of the linear
equations (2) and (3) associated with the potential u=0(x c0t) of the KdV equation
(1), a new solution of the same KdV equation (1) is given by
^u(x;t) =0(x c0t) + 2@2
xlogv0(x;t): (22)
The new solution ^ u(x;t) is real and non-singular if and only if v0(x;t)6= 0 everywhere
in the (x;t) plane. This is true for 02( 1;1(k)), which is below the Floquet
spectrum (Figure 3), because Sturm's nodal theorem implies that v(x;t);given by
(18), are sign-denite in xfor everyt2R. However, if 02(2(k);3(k)) is in the
nite gap, Sturm's nodal theorem implies that v(x;t) have exactly one zero on the
fundamental period of 0for everyt2R. We will show that this technical obstacle
can be overcome with the translation of the new solution ^ u(x;t) with respect to a
half-period in the complex plane of x.
The following proposition gives an important relation between the Jacobi cnoidal
function and the Jacobi theta function.

The following two theorems present the construction of bright and dark breathers in
the form (5) with either (6) or (7). These two theorems contribute to the main result
of this work.
Theorem 1. There exists an exact solution to the KdV equation (1) in the form (5)

Proof. Consider a linear combination of the two solutions to the linear system (2) and
(3) in the form (18) with =K(k) +iK0(k) +and=F(';k)2(0;K(k)):

(30)
where (c+;c ) are arbitary constants. By using the half-period translations of the
Jacobi theta functions [22, 8.183], we obtain for =K(k) +iK0(k) +:
H(x+) =eK0(k)

we express the parameters b,b, andcbin terms of incomplete elliptic integrals in

Remark 1. The solution u(x;t)obtained in the proof of Theorem 1 is the half-period
translation along the real axis of the solution ^u(x;t)dened by (22).

Proof. When2(2(k);3(k)),=F(';k)2(0;K(k)),!() andZ() =Z(';k)
are real by Propositions 3 and 4. However, the functions H(x) change sign so that
we should express them in terms of the functions ( x) after complex translation
of phases. This is achieved by the half-period translations [22, 8.183]:
H(x+) =ie K0(k)

Thex-dependent complex phase is now a multiplier in the linear superposition (30)
which vanishes in the result due to the second logarithmic derivative. By using (22)

c+=ce (x0 iK0(k))Z()+i
2K(k); c =ce(x0 iK0(k))Z() i

and obtain a new solution in the nal form u(x;t) := ^u(x+iK0(k);t) with the same
u(x;t) as in (5) and with (x;t) given by (7) with the following parameters: d:=2

and dn(;k) =+k2, we express the parameters d,d, andcdin terms of incomplete
elliptic integrals as (31), (32), and (33). Since d>0, we have cd<c0. 
Remark 3. The solution u(x;t)obtained in the proof of Theorem 2 is the half-period
translation along the imaginary axis of the solution ^u(x;t)dened by (22).
Remark 4. SinceZ(';k)>0, it follows from (5), (7), and (23) that

A suitably normalized phase shift of the background cnoidal wave can be written in the
form:

When d2(0;], the normalized phase shift is positive. When d2(;2), the
normalized phase shift is considered to be negative by translation to d 22( ;0).
7.Properties of the bright breather
Figure 5 plots  b,b, andcbfor a bright breather as a function of the parameter ,
see Theorem 1 and Remark 2. The phase shift  bincreases monotonically while the
inverse width band the breather speed cbdecrease monotonically as increases from
 1 towards the band edge 1(k);shown by the vertical dashed line. Since c0= 1:12
fork= 0:8, we conrm that cb>c0, which can also be observed in Figure 1.
Figure 5. Normalized phase shift  b(left), inverse width b(middle),
and breather speed cb(right) versus in ( 1;1(k)) fork= 0:8. The
band edge1(k) = k2is shown by the vertical dashed line.
Figure 6 characterizes the family of bright breathers by plotting cb c0andb
versus  bfor three values of k. Proles of representative breather solutions shown
in Figure 6 conrm why we call them bright breathers. Bright breathers are more
localized, have larger amplitudes, and move faster for smaller (more negative) values
of b(smaller values of ). For suciently large amplitude,  bfalls below and the
breather exhibits a positive phase shift  b+ 22(0;] (cf. Remark 2). In contrast,
for suciently small-amplitude breathers,  b2( ;0) and the phase shift is negative.KDV BREATHERS 17

8.Properties of the dark breather
Figure 7 plots  d,d, andcdfor dark breathers as a function of the parameter ,
see Theorem 2 and Remark 4. The phase shift  dis monotonically decreasing between
the band edges 2(k) and3(k);shown by the vertical dashed lines. The inverse width
dhas a single maximum and vanishes at the band edges. The breather speed cdis
monotonically decreasing. Since c0= 0:08 fork= 0:7, we conrm that cd<c0, which
is also clear from Figure 2.
Figure 8 characterizes the family of dark breathers by plotting cd c0anddversus
dfor three values of k. The proles of breather solutions at t= 0 subject to the
phase shift x0= 5 conrm why we refer to them as dark breathers. In contrast
to the bright breather case, dark breather solutions exhibit vanishing cnoidal wave
modulations for both of the extreme phase shifts  d!0 and  d!2, with the
largest-amplitude breather occurring at an intermediate phase shift, which we will
later identify by examining the inverse width d.KDV BREATHERS 21

The dark breather with this value of can be interpreted as the narrowest

Consequently, the most localized dark breather exhibits a positive phase shift.
The phase shift is negative for near2(k) since  d 22( ;0) (cf. Re-
mark 4) and is positive for near3(k) since  d2(0;). This partitions dark
breathers into two branches: the slow (fast) branch for 0 <d<max(k)<
(max(k)<d<2). The slow branch exhibits dark breathers with strictly
positive phase shifts whose amplitudes increase with increasing phase shift. On
the fast branch, dark breathers can have positive or negative phase shift de-
pending on whether  dis less than or greater than , respectively. Also, an
increase in phase shift corresponds to a decrease in amplitude.

We show that the dark breather as k!0 can be approximated by a dark soliton
solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation.
In the limit k!0, the interval [ 2(k);3(k)] shrinks to the point = 1 and the
solutionu(x;t) converges to the zero solution such that both the cnoidal wave and the
dark breather vanish. For small k, it is well-known (see, e.g., [28]) that the multiple

9.Conclusion
A comprehensive characterization of explicit solutions of the KdV equation, repre-
senting the nonlinear superposition of a soliton and cnoidal wave, has been obtained
using the Darboux transformation. These solutions are breathers, manifesting as non-
linear wavepackets propagating with constant velocity on a cnoidal, periodic, traveling
wave background, subject to a topological phase shift. Breathers of elevation type,
called bright breathers, are shown to propagate faster than the cnoidal background.
Depression-type breathers are called dark breathers and they move slower than the
cnoidal background. A key nding is that each breather on a xed cnoidal wave back-
ground is uniquely determined by two distinct parameters: its initial position and a
spectral parameter. We prove that the spectral parameter is in one-to-one correspon-
dence with the normalized phase shift, which it imparts to the cnoidal background, in
the interval ( ;]:
Bright breathers with small, negative phase shifts correspond to small-scale ampli-
tude modulations of the cnoidal wave background, which result in the cnoidal wave
dominating the solution. Small, positive phase shifts correspond to bright breathers
with large-scale amplitude modulations of the cnoidal wave background where the soli-
ton component is dominant. As the phase shift is swept across the interval (  ;], all
breather amplitudes are attained.
In contrast, dark breather amplitudes, being of depression type, are limited. Small
phase shifts, positive or negative, correspond to small modulations of the cnoidal wave
background and the slow or fast branch of solutions, respectively. For each cnoidal
wave background, we nd a narrowest dark breather that imparts a positive phase
shift. When the amplitude of the cnoidal wave background is small, dark breathersKDV BREATHERS 27
degenerate into dark soliton solutions of the NLS equation (45) derived from the KdV
equation (1).
When the period of the cnoidal wave background goes to innity, both bright and
dark breather solutions are shown to degenerate into two-soliton solutions of the KdV
equation. In this sense, breathers can be viewed as a generalization of two-soliton
interactions. While such an interpretation is well-known for the sine-Gordon, focusing
NLS, and the focusing modied KdV equations where breathers can be interpreted as
bound states of two solitons [9], those breather solutions are localized. In contrast,
the topological KdV breathers with an extended, periodic background described here
represent a dierent class of nonlinear wave interaction solutions. We expect that such
solutions exist for other integrable nonlinear evolutionary equations with a self-adjoint
scattering problem such as the defocusing NLS and defocusing modied KdV equations.
An important application of these breather solutions is to the problem of soliton-
dispersive shock wave (DSW) interaction [2]. Bright breathers were identied in [4] as
being associated with soliton-DSW transmission. Soliton-DSW trapping corresponds
to dark breathers embedding within the DSW. The spectral characterization of KdV
breathers obtained here can be used in the context of multi-phase Whitham modula-
tion theory [5] to describe the dynamics of breathers subject to large-scale amplitude
modulations [4]. In addition to soliton-DSW interaction, the bright breathers resemble
the propagation of a soliton through a special kind of deterministic soliton gas, con-
structed using Riemann-Hilbert methods from primitive potentials of the defocusing
modied KdV equation [18]. Similar deterministic soliton gases have been identied
as soliton condensates for the KdV equation [19] and provide further applications for
the breathers constructed here.
