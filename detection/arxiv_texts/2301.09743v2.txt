ABSTRACT
In this investigation, we present an analysis of the metallicity distribu tion that pertains to neutral
gas in the local Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). We derive relative I SM metallicities for a sample of
84 sight lines probing diﬀuse atomic and molecular gas within 4 kpc of the Sun. Our analysis is based,
in large part, on column density measurements reported in the litera ture for 22 diﬀerent elements
that are commonly studied in interstellar clouds. We supplement the lit erature data with new column
density determinations for certain key elements and for several in dividual sight lines important to our
analysis. Our methodology involves comparing the relative gas-phas e abundances of many diﬀerent
elements for a given sight line to simultaneously determine the streng th of dust depletion in that
direction and the overall metallicity oﬀset. We ﬁnd that many sight line s probe multiple distinct gas
regions with diﬀerent depletion properties, which complicates the me tallicity analysis. Nevertheless,
our results provide clear evidence that the dispersion in the metallicit ies of neutral interstellar clouds
in the solar neighborhood is small ( ∼0.10 dex) and only slightly larger than the typical measurement
uncertainties. We ﬁnd no evidence for the existence of very low met allicity gas (as has recently been
reported by De Cia et al.) along any of the 84 sight lines in our sample. Ou r results are consistent
with a local Galactic ISM that is well mixed and chemically homogeneous.

1.INTRODUCTION
Most models of Galactic chemical evolution assume
that the gas enriched in the products of stellar nucle-
osynthesis is instantaneously mixed into the interstellar
medium (ISM; e.g., Timmes et al. 1995 ;Chiappini et al.
1997). The instantaneous mixing assumption, while not
entirely realistic, can nevertheless yield model predic-

There is strongobservationalevidence that supports the
idea that the ISM, at a given Galactocentric distance,
is well mixed and chemically homogeneous. In a com-
prehensive study of abundances in early B-type stars in
the solar neighborhood, Nieva & Przybilla (2012) found
very narrow distributions in the abundances of He, C,
N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe, with standard deviations
equal to 0.05 dex or less. Luck(2018) conducted a thor-
ough examinationofabundancesin hundreds ofclassical
Cepheid stars. For Cepheids located within 1 kpc of the
Sun,Luck(2018) ﬁnds that the standard deviation in
the values of [Fe/H] is 0.10 dex.
Arellano-C´ ordova et al. (2021) presented results on
radial abundance gradients in the Milky Way from a
uniform analysis of 42 Galactic H iiregions. They ﬁnd2
that the dispersion in the values of O/H and N/H with
respect to the computed gradients is 0.07 and 0.11 dex,
respectively. Ritchey et al. (2018) reported on the gas-
phase abundances of O and several neutron-capture el-
ements for a sample of 128 sight lines probing the neu-
tral ISM in the solar vicinity. The analysis of elemen-
tal abundances in the neutral ISM is complicated by
the presence of signiﬁcant depletion onto dust grains
for most elements (e.g., Jenkins 2009 ). Adopting the
methodology of Jenkins (2009),Ritchey et al. (2018)
identiﬁed and modelled the depletion behaviors for the
elements they considered. For O, Ge, and Kr, which
have the largest number of abundance measurements in
the sample, Ritchey et al. (2018) ﬁnd that the disper-
sions in the abundances with respect to the depletion
trends are 0.07, 0.10, and 0.07 dex, respectively. Nu-
merous other studies have examined the homogeneity of
gas-phase interstellar abundances in the solar neighbor-
hood (e.g., Cardelli et al. 1996 ;Meyer et al. 1997 ,1998;
Cartledge et al. 2003 ,2004,2006). These studies have
generally found only small variations in the gas-phase
abundances once the eﬀects of dust-grain depletion are
taken into account.
From a theoretical perspective, the Galactic ISM is
expected to be well mixed in the azimuthal direction
(e.g.,Edmunds 1975 ;Roy & Kunth 1995 ). Turbu-
lent transport in the shear ﬂow of diﬀerential rota-
tion should reduce azimuthal inhomogeneities in large
disk galaxies like the Milky Way within a characteristic
timescale of 109yr (Roy & Kunth 1995 ). On smaller
scales, turbulent mixing due to supernova explosions
(de Avillez & Mac Low 2002 ) and thermal instabilities
(Yang & Krumholz 2012 ) leads to even shorter mixing
timescales. Petit et al. (2015) studied turbulent mix-
ing driven by gravitational instabilities and found that
metallicity inhomogeneities are destroyed in the az-
imuthal direction in less than a galactic orbital period.
Recently, however, De Cia et al. (2021) reported ﬁnd-
ing large metallicity variations in the neutral ISM to-
ward stars located within 3 kpc of the Sun. After apply-
ingtwoseparatetechniquestoaccountfordust-grainde-
pletion,De Cia et al. (2021) report depletion-corrected
metallicities in the range −0.76≤[M/H]≤+0.26 dex
for their sample of 25 sight lines. They report a mean
value of [M /H] of−0.26 dex and a standard deviation of
0.28 dex. De Cia et al. (2021) attribute the low metal-
licity material to the eﬀects of metal-poor infall from
high-velocity clouds combined with ineﬃcient mixing
in the Galactic disk. However, these conclusions run
counter to the growing body of evidence from observa-
tional and theoretical work that the ISM, at a givenGalactocentric distance, is (and is expected to be) well
mixed and chemically homogeneous.
Upon closer examination, we ﬁnd that there are
serious ﬂaws in the analysis techniques adopted in
De Cia et al. (2021) that undermine their conclusions.
For example, they derive column densities from rela-
tively strong interstellar absorption lines (e.g., Zn ii
λλ2026,2062) using spectra obtained at moderate res-
olution (∆ v∼10 km s−1). While attempts are made
to account for unresolved saturation in the absorption
proﬁles, it appears that these attempts are inadequate
in some cases and that many of the Zn iicolumn den-
sities in particular may be underestimated. A more
serious issue is that the elements used by De Cia et al.
(2021) for their metallicity estimates (Si, Ti, Cr, Fe,
Ni, and Zn) are the more refractory elements, which
are signiﬁcantly impacted by dust depletion. Volatile
elements (such as C, N, O, and Kr), which are more
reliable metallicity indicators, are not included in their
analysis, even though they yield conﬂicting results.
Inthisinvestigation,weseektoderive,inamuchmore
deﬁnitive way, the metallicity distribution for the local
Galactic ISM. Our analysisrelies mainly on high-quality
gas-phase abundance measurements reported in the lit-
erature. However, we also obtain new column density
determinations for certain key elements and for several
important and/or interesting sight lines in order to ﬁll
in some of the gaps in the literature data. The method-
ology used in our metallicity analysis, which is based
on the uniﬁed representation of interstellar depletions
devised by Jenkins (2009), is described in Section 2.
The sources and methods used to obtain column den-
sity measurements for our sample are described in Sec-
tion3. The metallicity estimates themselves are pro-
vided in Section 4. In Section 5.1, we present a detailed
comparison between our metallicity determinations and
those ofDe Cia et al. (2021). In Section 5.2, we discuss
the implications of our results in the context of other
measurements of metallicity variations in the Galactic
disk. We summarize our conclusions in Section 6. An
appendix provides a compilation of all of the column
density measurements used in the metallicity analysis.
2.METHODOLOGY
In a comprehensive analysis of interstellar depletions,
Jenkins(2009)utilizedmeasurementsofelementalabun-
dances reported in the literature for a sample of 243
sight lines to examine the depletion characteristics of 17
diﬀerent elements. Jenkins(2009) developed a uniﬁed
representation of gas-phase element depletions pred-
icated on the empirical observation that, while dif-
ferent elements exhibit diﬀerent degrees of depletion,3
the depletions of most elements tend to increase in a
systematic way as the overall strength of depletions
increases from one line of sight to the next. Sight
lines with stronger depletions are thought to contain
higher proportions of denser and/or colder gas ( Spitzer
1985;Savage & Sembach 1996 ), while sight lines with
very low depletions may contain grains that have been
partially destroyed through sputtering in interstellar
shocks (e.g., Shull et al. 1977 ). The increase in the
overall strength of depletions, from low-density dif-
fuse atomic gas to higher-density diﬀuse molecular
clouds, may then be regarded as evidence of grain
growth in the ISM ( Dwek & Scalo 1980 ;Jenkins et al.
1986;Savage & Sembach 1996 ;Jenkins 2009 ,2013).
Many grain history calculations have suggested that the
survival of dust grains against destruction via shock
sputtering requires continued growth in diﬀuse clouds
(Seab & Shull 1983 ;Jones et al. 1994 ;Slavin et al.
2015). With these considerations, Jenkins(2009) de-
ﬁned a sight-line depletion strength factor, denoted F∗,
which indicates the extent to which grain growth has
progressed in the gas sampled by a particular line of
sight. The value of F∗for any given sight line is based
on a weighted average of the available observed deple-
tions for that direction (see Equation (4) in Jenkins
2009). Sight lines showing strong depletions, such as
those seen in the low velocity ( vLSR=−1 km s−1) com-
ponent toward ζOph (e.g., Savage et al. 1992 ), have
depletion strengths near F∗= 1, while those with the
weakest depletions have F∗values close to zero.
The depletion of an element Xfrom the gas phase
is deﬁned with respect to an adopted cosmic reference
abundance, typically the solar system abundance of the
element. In logarithmic terms, we have:
[X/H] = log N(X)−logN(Htot)−log(X/H)⊙,(1)
whereN(X) is the total column density of element X
in its dominant ionization stage, N(Htot) =N(Hi) +
2N(H2) is the total hydrogen column density along the
line of sight, and ( X/H)⊙is the solar reference abun-
dance. In the framework developed by Jenkins(2009),
the logarithmic depletion of an element depends on the
sight-line depletion strength factor according to:
[X/H] =BX+AX(F∗−zX), (2)
where the depletion parameters AX,BX, andzXare
unique to each speciﬁc element. As described in more
detail in Jenkins (2009), the slope parameter AXin-
dicates how quickly the depletion of a particular ele-
ment strengthensasthe growthofdust grainsprogresses
within interstellar clouds (see also Jenkins 2013 ). Theintercept parameter BXindicates the expected deple-
tion of element XatF∗=zX, wherezXrepresents a
weighted mean value of F∗for the particular set of sight
lines with depletion measurements available for that ele-
ment. Valuesofthecoeﬃcients AXandBXareobtained
for a speciﬁc element through the evaluation of a least-
squares linear ﬁt, with [ X/H] as the dependent variable
andF∗the independent variable. (The reason for the
additional term involving zXin Equation (2) is that, for
a particular choice of zX, there is a near zero covariance
between the formal ﬁtting errors for the solutions of AX
andBX(seeJenkins 2009 ).)
Jenkins(2009) obtained values of the element-speciﬁc
depletion parameters for 17 diﬀerent elements: C, N, O,
Mg, Si, P, S, Cl, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ge, and
Kr. Later, Ritchey et al. (2018), adopting the Jenkins
(2009) methodology, derived depletion parameters for
B, Ga, As, Cd, Sn, and Pb and re-evaluated the deple-
tion parameters for O, Ge, and Kr using larger samples
of elemental abundance measurements. Most recently,
Ritchey et al. (2023) re-determined the values of the de-
pletion parameters for the elements P and Cl, both to
account for recent updates in the oscillator strengths
of the relevant P iiand Clitransitions and to correct
for a deﬁciency in the Cl analysis presented in Jenkins
(2009). In the original analysis, Jenkins (2009) con-
sidered only Cl iicolumn densities in deriving total Cl
abundances. However, Cl is unique among most other
elements commonly studied in the ISM in that either its
neutral or its singly-ionized form can dominate the total
abundance depending on the amount of molecular hy-
drogen present along the line of sight (e.g., Jura & York
1978).Ritchey et al. (2023) included column densities
of both Cl iand Cliiin their derivations of total Cl
abundances and Cl depletion factors.
Based on the formalism developed to study gas-phase
element depletions, Jenkins(2009) proposed a method
that could be used to examine the metallicities of dis-
tant (extragalactic) absorption systems, such as those
seen in the optical spectra of high-redshift quasars. As
we show below, the metallicity determined according to
this method is the metallicity of the absorption system
relative to the average metallicity that characterizes the
local Galactic ISM. (Hereafter, we refer to this quan-
tity as the “relative ISM metallicity”.) In the present
work, we use this method to examine the spread in the
metallicities determined for sight lines probing the solar
neighborhood (out to ∼4 kpc).
To determine the relative ISM metallicity for a given
sight line, we ﬁrst equate the two expressions for [ X/H]
presented in Equations (1) and (2):4
logN(X)−logN(Htot)−log(X/H)⊙=BX+AX(F∗−zX).
(3)
Rearranging terms, we have:
logN(X)−log(X/H)⊙−BX+AXzX= logN(Htot)+F∗AX.
(4)
The quantity N(Htot) appearing on the righthand side
of Equation (4) can be interpreted as the total hydro-
gencolumn density that wouldbe expected basedon the
column density of element Xand the overall strength of
depletions along the line of sight ( F∗). However, this ex-
pectation holds only if the metallicity of the gas is equal
to the average ISM metallicity in the solar neighbor-
hood. If the metallicity is somewhat diﬀerent, then the
true hydrogen column density will be higher or lower
than the predicted value. Thus, if the total hydrogen
column density is known independently from observa-
tions, we can rewrite Equation (4) in terms of the rela-
tive ISM metallicity:
[M/H]ISM= logN(Htot)pred−logN(Htot)obs.(5)
Subtracting log N(Htot)obsfrom both sides of Equation
(4) yields:
[X/H]obs−BX+AXzX= [M/H]ISM+F∗AX,(6)
where
[X/H]obs= logN(X)−logN(Htot)obs−log(X/H)⊙(7)
is the observed depletion of element X. Since the quan-
titiesAX,BX, andzXhave been tabulated for many
diﬀerent elements, a least-squares linear ﬁt to the equa-
tion:
y=a+bx, (8)
where
y= [X/H]obs−BX+AXzX (9)
and
x=AX, (10)
will yield values for the coeﬃcients
a= [M/H]ISM (11)
andb=F∗. (12)
As stated above, the metallicity derived in this way is
the metallicity of the absorption system relative to the
average ISM metallicity in the solar neighborhood. It
isnotthe metallicity relative to an adopted solar (or
cosmic)abundancestandard. Toseewhythisisthecase,
let us consider the deﬁnition of the intercept parameter
BX. Rearranging Equation (2) and setting F∗=zX
gives:
BX= [X/H]F∗=zX= log(X/H)F∗=zX−log(X/H)⊙,
(13)
wherelog( X/H)F∗=zXisthe(average)logarithmicabun-
dance of element Xevaluated at F∗=zX(according to
the linear ﬁt used to determine AXandBX). Substitut-
ing the above expression for BXinto Equation (6) and
rearranging terms yields:
[M/H]ISM= log(X/H)obs−log(X/H)F∗=zX−AX(F∗−zX).
(14)
Note that Equation (14) makes no reference to any solar
(or cosmic) abundance standard. The terms involving
the solar abundance of element Xhave cancelled out of
the equation. Nevertheless, despite this apparent short-
coming, the method described here can still provide us
with useful information on the variations in metallicity
that characterize the interstellar gas in the solar vicin-
ity. In Section 4, we use this method to derive relative
ISM metallicities for a sample of 84 sight lines probing
the local Galactic ISM.
3.CONSTRUCTING THE SAMPLE
In order to obtain a statistically signiﬁcant result for
the metallicity distribution in the solar neighborhood,
we need high-quality column density measurements for
a variety of elements in their dominant ionization stage
for a relatively large sample of interstellar sight lines.
Fortunately, many such measurements have been pub-
lished over the past several decades. Thus, in construct-
ing our sample, we rely primarily on column density
measurements reported in the literature (Section 3.1).
However, we supplement these data with new column
density determinations for certain key elements and for
several important and/or interesting sight lines (as de-
scribed in Section 3.2).
3.1.Accumulation of Data from the Literature
In compiling ourdatabaseofhigh-qualitycolumn den-
sity measurements from the literature, we focus on the5
following elements: B, C, N, O, Mg, Si, P, Cl, Ti, Cr,
Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Kr, Cd, Sn, and Pb. All
22 of these elements have been analyzed in a way con-
sistent with the methodology devised by Jenkins(2009),
and all have values of the depletion parameters AX,
BX, andzXtabulated in the literature ( Jenkins 2009 ;
Ritchey et al. 2018 ,2023).1The inclusion of as many
diﬀerent elements as possible in our least-squares linear
ﬁts helps to ensure that the relative ISM metallicities
we derive are robust.
Mostofthe dominantions ofthe elementslisted above
have electronic transitions out of the ground state with
wavelengths in the UV portion of the spectrum acces-
sible to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). For these
ions, we restricted our search to determinations of col-
umn densities based on observations obtained with the
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) or the
Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS). We
do not include in our sample measurements made us-
ing earlier spaceborne instruments such as Copernicus
or the International Ultraviolet Explorer. Abundance
determinationsmadeusingthese earlierUVinstrumentstend to be less precise than those based on HST obser-
vations (e.g., Meyer et al. 1998 ). For a few ions (e.g.,
Ni, Clii, and Fe ii), many of the observed transitions
have wavelengths below 1200 ˚A, a regime covered by the
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). Finally,
all of the observed transitions of Ti iihave wavelengths
above 3000 ˚A. A variety of ground-based optical tele-
scopes have been used to study these transitions (see,
e.g.,Welty & Crowther 2010 ).
Many investigations of elemental abundances based
on observations of interstellar absorption lines fall into
one of two categories. Some studies focus on one or
several elements and obtain abundances for a large, di-
verse set of interstellar sight lines (e.g., Cartledge et al.
2004,2006;Ritchey et al. 2011 ,2018,2023;Jenkins
2019). Others focus on a single line of sight and de-
rive abundances for as many atomic (and molecular)
speciesaspossible(e.g., Sonnentrucker et al.2002 ,2003;
Welty et al. 2020 ). Both types of investigations are uti-
lized in the present study, where our aim is to compile
as many reliable elemental abundance measurements as
possible for as large a sample as is feasible.

1WhileJenkins (2009) determined depletion parameters for S,
he pointed out diﬃculties in working with that element. The o nly
Siitransitions that are available are the ones in the strong tri plet
that spans 1250 to 1260 ˚A. For most sight lines, these absorption
features are strongly saturated. When the total hydrogen co lumn
density is low enough, the lines are not saturated, but contr ibu-
tions of S iifrom Hiiregions can lead to misleading conclusions
on the abundance of S in the neutral gas.6

aDistances are based on Gaia EDR3 parallax measurements ( Bailer-Jones et al. 2021 ).
bReference(s) for the values of N(Hi) andN(H2) used to calculate N(Htot): (1)Jenkins (2019); (2)Jenkins (2009); (3)
Welty et al. (1999); (4)Welty et al. (2020); (5)Diplas & Savage (1994); (6)Rachford et al. (2009); (7)Ritchey et al. (2023).
After our initial survey of the literature, our database
contained column density measurements for the domi-
nant ions of the elements listed above for a total of 223
sight lines. All of these measurements (with the excep-
tion of those for Ti ii) are based on spectroscopic obser-
vationsacquiredusingHSTorFUSE.However,approxi-
mately half of the sight lines in this initial database had
abundance measurements for only a few elements. Inorder for the method described in Section 2to yield re-
liabledeterminationsof[M /H]ISM, eachsightlineshould
have a suﬃcient number of elemental abundance mea-
surements, and the elements measured should have as
wide a range as possible of AXvalues, so that the slopes
andy-intercepts of the linear ﬁts are adequately con-
strained. We decided (somewhat arbitrarily) that each
sight line should have abundance measurements for at
least eight diﬀerent elements in order to be included in8
our survey. The imposition of this threshold left us with
a sample of 78 sight lines. (Six sight lines with the req-
uisite number of column density measurements were ex-
cluded from our survey because they do not have pub-
lished and/or reliable values of N(Hi) andN(H2) nec-
essary for the metallicity analysis.) Six additional sight
lines were subsequently added to our sample based on
new column density measurements (as described in Sec-
tion3.2) bringing the total number of sight lines in our
ﬁnal sample to 84.
Basic information regarding the background stars and
the characteristics of the sight lines included in the ﬁ-
nal sample is provided in Table 1. The stellar distances
and their uncertainties (as well as the values of zde-
rived from the distances) are based on Gaia EDR3 par-
allax measurements ( Bailer-Jones et al. 2021 ). Most of
the measurements of N(Hi) andN(H2) used to derive
N(Htot) are obtained from Jenkins(2019) or from the
values compiled by Jenkins(2009). Exceptions to this
are noted in the table. A compilation of column density
measurements for all of the elements other than hydro-
gen for the 84 sight lines in our ﬁnal sample is provided
in the appendix.

values adopted in the present work are from the com-
pilations of Morton (2000,2003). However, there
have been several signiﬁcant improvements in oscil-
lator strengths in the two decades since those com-
pilations were published. New experimental f-values
are now available for commonly observed transitions
of Pii(Federman et al. 2007 ;Brown et al. 2018 ),
Cli(Alkhayat et al. 2019 ), Clii(Schectman et al.
2005), Cuii(Brown et al. 2009 ), Geii(Heidarian et al.
2017), and Pb ii(Heidarian et al. 2015 ). In addi-
tion, empirically-derived f-values have been deter-
mined for several transitions of Fe ii(Miller et al. 2007 )
and Ni ii(Jenkins & Tripp 2006 ;Boiss´ e & Bergeron
2019). There are no experimentally-determined f-
values for the Mn iiλλ1197,1199,1201 triplet. Fol-
lowingCashman et al. (2017), we adopt the theoretical
results of Toner & Hibbert (2005) for these Mn iilines.
Finally, while there are new theoretical calculations for
the oscillator strengths of the Ti iiλ3072,λ3229,λ3241,
andλ3383 lines ( Lundberg et al. 2016 ), and the Zn ii
λλ2026,2062 doublet ( Kisielius et al. 2015 ), we prefer
the experimental f-values listed in Morton(2003) for
these transitions.2
In Table 3, we present the complete list of refer-
ences that supplied column densities for the metallicity
analysis, along with a code for each reference. These
codes are used in the appendix to identify the source of
each column density measurement. We also indicate for
each reference in Table 3the element or elements from
that investigation whose column densities are included
in the present study. If the column density measure-
ments pertain to just a single line of sight, then the
sight line is also indicated. It is important to note that,
while over 40 references are listed in Table 3, approx-
imately two-thirds of the more than 900 column den-
sity measurements in our ﬁnal sample come from just
six references: Cartledge et al. (2006),Jensen & Snow
(2007),Ritchey et al. (2011,2018,2023), andJenkins
(2019). Another 12% of the measurements are newly
derived column densities obtained in this work (Sec-
tion3.2). Finally, many of the column density measure-
ments adopted for the line of sight toward HD 24534
2The adopted f-values often have little impact on the metal-
licity analysis. If all of the column densities for a certain element
are derived from one transition (or a particular set of trans itions)
and the f-value of that transition is altered, the column densities
will be shifted accordingly. However, the BXparameter will also
be shifted in the opposite sense, leaving the values of yfor that
element unchanged (see Equation 9).10

3.2.New Column Density Determinations
Once our literature survey was complete, we recog-
nized that there were deﬁciencies in the abundance data
available, especially for the refractory elements Ni and
Ti. These elements are particularly important in the
metallicity analysis because they represent two of the
most severely depleted elements. With large (negative)
values of the depletion slope parameter AX, these ele-
ments help to anchor the least-squares linear ﬁts used
to derive values of [M /H]ISM(see Section 4). How-
ever, fewer than half of the sight lines in our sample
drawn from the literature had published Ni iicolumn
densities (e.g., from Cartledge et al. 2006 ), while only
about one-third had published measurements of Ti ii
(seeWelty & Crowther 2010 ). This is despite the fact
that Niiiobservations are available from the Mikulski
Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) for nearly every
sight line in our sample (due to the prevalence of STIS
E140H spectra obtained with the 1271 ˚A central wave-
length setting). Furthermore, nearly half of our sight
lines have archival ground-based spectra obtained with
theUltravioletandVisualEchelleSpectrograph(UVES)
on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) that cover the rele-
vant Tiiitransitions between 3200 ˚A and 3400 ˚A. We
therefore decided to derive Ni iicolumn densities for all
ofthe sightlines in oursamplelackingthis measurement
for which high-resolution STIS echelle spectra are avail-
able in the MAST archive and Ti iicolumn densities for
all of our sight lines with archival VLT/UVES data.
High-resolution (E140H and E230H) STIS spectra
were obtained from the MAST archive for all cen-
tral wavelength settings that cover the Ni iiλ1317,
λ1370,λ1454,λ1709,λ1741, and λ1751 transitions.
(These data have velocity resolutions in the range 2.1–
3.7 km s−1.) Multiple exposures of the same star were
co-added and the overlapping portions of the echelle or-
derswerecombined. Portionsofthespectrasurrounding
the Niiiabsorption lines were normalized to the con-
tinuum via low-order Legendre polynomial ﬁts. Column
densities were obtained from individual Ni iitransitions
by integrating the apparent optical depth (AOD) pro-
ﬁles (e.g., Savage & Sembach 1991 ;Jenkins 2019 ). Un-
certainties in the AOD column densities were calculated
by adding in quadrature the uncertainties arising from
noise in the spectra, from errors in continuum place-
ment, and from uncertainties in the adopted values of
logfλ. Final Ni iicolumn densities were obtained bytaking a weighted mean of the results derived from the
diﬀerent transitions along a given line of sight.
Pipeline-processed VLT/UVES spectra covering the
Tiiiλ3229,λ3241, and λ3383 transitions were down-
loaded from the European Southern Observatory (ESO)
Science Archive Facility. (The UVES spectra have a
nominal velocity resolution of ∼4.2 km s−1.) Multiple
exposures of a given target were weighted according to
the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios of the spectra and co-
added, after correcting the velocity scales to the refer-
ence frame of the local standard of rest (LSR). Column
densities (and uncertainties in column density) were ob-
tained using the AOD method, as discussed above for
the Niiilines. When multiple Ti iitransitions were de-
tected in a given direction, ﬁnal column densities were
derived from a weighted mean of the results obtained
from the individual transitions.
Most of the Ni iiand Tiiilines examined here do
notshowsigniﬁcantevidenceofunresolvedsaturatedab-
sorption in the line proﬁles. The results obtained from
diﬀerent transitions of the same ion along the same line
of sight generally agree within the uncertainties. For
HD 79186 and HD 149757 ( ζOph), however, there are
signiﬁcant discrepancies in the column densities derived
from the Ti iiλ3383 and λ3241 lines. For these sight
lines, we adopt the results from the stronger λ3383 tran-
sition, whichislessinﬂuencedbynoisearisingfromCCD
response fringes in the UVES data. For HD 37061, the
Niiiλ1317 line is the only Ni iitransition available,
and the line both is extremely narrow and has a central
depth approaching zero. For this sight line, and for sev-
eralotherswith narrowabsorptionfeatures, weobtained
Niiicolumn densities via multi-component Voigt proﬁle
ﬁtting using the code ISMOD ( Sheﬀer et al. 2008 ).
We also obtained new column density determinations
from high-resolution STIS spectra for two other refrac-
tory elements: Fe and Cr. Most published values of
Feiicolumn densities for sight lines in our sample come
from a study that relied on low-resolution (∆ v∼18
km s−1) FUSE spectra ( Jensen & Snow 2007 ). Like-
wise, the only previously published Cr abundances in
our database were derived in a single study that an-
alyzed archival GHRS spectra ( Roth & Blades 1995 ).
However, high-resolutionSTIS spectra coveringthe Fe ii
λ1611,λ2249, and λ2260 transitions and the Cr ii
λλ2056,2062,2066 triplet are available for several sight
lines without published abundances for these ions. We
therefore obtained Fe iiand Criicolumn densities for
these directions using our Voigt proﬁle ﬁtting technique.
We also derived Mg iiand Mn iicolumn densities for
severalsight lines that had not been previouslyanalyzed
byCartledge et al. (2006) orJenkins (2019). These12
results were obtained via proﬁle ﬁtting of the Mg ii
λλ1239,1240 doublet and the Mn iiλ1197 and λ1201
lines.
Two sight lines (HD 73882 and HD 149404) ini-
tially had only three elemental abundance measure-
ments published in the literature (for N, Ti, and Fe;
Knauth et al. 2003 ;Jensen et al. 2007 ;Jensen & Snow
2007;Welty & Crowther 2010 ). However, new high-
resolution STIS spectra recently became publically
available for these directions.3Since these sight lines
are also analyzed in De Cia et al. (2021), we wanted to
perform an independent analysis of the metallicities in
these directions. To accomplish this, we analyzed the
Oiλ1355, Mg iiλλ1239,1240, Ni iiλ1317, Ni iiλ1370,
Cuiiλ1358, and Ge iiλ1237 lines via proﬁle ﬁtting
to obtain the total column densities of these ions along
the lines of sight. Where multiple transitions were ana-
lyzed for a given ion, ﬁnal column densities were again
obtained by evaluating a weighted mean.
High-resolution STIS spectra are also available for the
line of sight to HD 147933 ( ρOph A), although, to our
knowledge,thesedatahavenotyetbeen published. This
is another important sight line that was included in the
De Cia et al. (2021) sample. The high total hydrogen
column density and intrinsically narrow velocity distri-
bution of the gas toward ρOph A, combined with the
FUV and NUV coverage of the available high-resolution
STIS spectra, allow us to derive column densities for
manydiﬀerentdominantionsinthisdirection. Inpartic-
ular, we obtained column densities through proﬁle syn-
thesis ﬁts to the following lines: C iiλ2325, Oiλ1355,
Mgiiλλ1239,1240,Siiiλ2335,Mn iiλ2305,Fe iiλ2367,
Niiiλ1317, Ge iiλ1237, As iiλ1263, Kr iλ1235,
Cdiiλλ2145,2265, and Pb iiλ1203. These measure-
ments represent the ﬁrst reported detections ofthe weak
Ciiλ2325 and Si iiλ2335 lines toward ρOph A.
After compiling our database of elemental abundance
measurements, we noted a few cases where the abun-
dances appeared to be outliers. The O iand Kriabun-
dances toward HD 195455 reported by Jenkins(2019)
are much larger than would be expected based on mea-
surements toward sight lines with similar (low) molec-
ular hydrogen fractions. The sight line to HD 195455
(atl= 20.3,b=−32.1) probes the lower Galactic halo
out to a distance 1.25 kpc below the Galactic plane.
This sight line also exhibits an unusual pattern of el-
emental abundances in plots of yversusx(see Sec-
tion4). Thus, to provide an independent check on the
3Ritchey et al. (2023) used these STIS data, combined with
archival FUSE observations, to obtain P and Cl column densit ies
for the line of sight to HD 73882.abundances in this direction, we derived new column
densities through a proﬁle ﬁtting analysis of the O i
λ1355, Mg iiλλ1239,1240, Mn iiλ1197, Ni iiλ1317,
Geiiλ1237, and Kr iλ1235 lines. We also found that
the Geiiabundance toward HD 192639 reported by
Sonnentrucker et al. (2002) was signiﬁcantly larger than
any other published measurement of Ge/H. A new col-
umn density determination for Ge iitoward HD 192639
(D. E. Welty, 2022, private communication) yields an
abundance that is more in line with expectations.
3.3.Properties of the Sight Lines
Our ﬁnal sample consists of 84 sight lines that probe
a diverse array of interstellar environments throughout
thelocalpartoftheMilkyWayGalaxy. Thedistancesto
the stars used as background targets range from 120 pc
to 4.0 kpc, while the values of E(B−V) range from 0.07
to0.70. Mostofthetargetsprobeinterstellarmaterialin
the Galactic midplane. However, four stars(HD 116852,
HD 121968, HD 195455, and HD 219188) sample gas in
the lower halo out to a maximum zdistance of 3.3 kpc.
Thirteen of the 84 stars in our sample were included
in the surveys of translucent sight lines published by
Rachford et al. (2002,2009). Translucent sight lines are
characterized by high visual extinction ( AV/greaterorsimilar1 mag)
and typically have high molecular hydrogen fractions.
On the opposite extreme, 22 sight lines in our ﬁnal sam-
ple have less than 10% of their total hydrogen in molec-
ular form. The diverse characteristics of the sight lines
in our sample help to ensure that the distribution of
metallicities we derive is fully representative of the ISM
in the solar vicinity.
4.DERIVATION OF RELATIVE ISM
METALLICITIES
Once the total column densities have been determined
for a variety of diﬀerent elements along a given line of
sight, it is straightforward to apply the methodology
described in Section 2to derive the relative ISM metal-
licity [M/H]ISMfrom a least-squares linear ﬁt to a plot
ofyversusx, whereyandxare deﬁned in Equations
(9) and (10), respectively. The complete list of column
density measurements used in our analysis of relative
ISM metallicities is provided in the appendix. Values
of the element-speciﬁc depletion parameters AX,BX,
andzXare compiled in Table 4for the 22 elements con-
sidered in our investigation. Note that the solar sys-
tem abundances (from Lodders 2003 ) are included in
Table4only because they were used in the evaluation
oftheBXparametersthroughEquation(2) (see Jenkins
2009;Ritchey et al. 2018 ,2023). They do not aﬀect the
determinations of relative ISM metallicities. Also note13

4.1.Basic Results
In Figures 1–7, we present plots of yversusxfor the
84 sight lines in our ﬁnal sample. Least-squares linear
ﬁts were evaluated using the Interactive Data Language
(IDL) procedure FITEXY, which accounts for errors in
both the xandycoordinates ( Press et al. 2007 ). The
solid black diagonal lines in Figures 1–7represent linear
ﬁts that include all of the elemental abundance mea-
surements available for a given sight line. The dotted
black horizontal lines indicate the y-intercepts associ-
ated with these linear ﬁts. The derived values for the
slopes, which represent F∗, and the y-intercepts, which
represent [M /H]ISM, along with their associated uncer-tainties, are presented in Table 5. In each case, we pro-
vide the reduced χ2value and the number of elemental
abundance measurements included in the ﬁt.
4.2.Nonlinearity in Trends of yversusx
Most ofthe linearﬁts that incorporateall of the abun-
dance measurements available in a given direction are
relatively good. The median value of χ2/νfor the ﬁts
involvingallelementsis1.10. However,the resultsfor12
sight lines (HD 37021, HD 37061, HD 62542, HD 73882,
HD 116852, HD 121968, HD 147888, HD 147933,
HD 195455, HD 198478, HD 219188, and HDE 303308)
indicate relatively poor ﬁts, with χ2/ν >2 (see Ta-
ble5). In some cases, a poor ﬁt may indicate that
the errors associated with the column density deter-
minations have been underestimated. Alternatively,
there could be local enhancements in the abundances14
Figure 1. Derivations of relative ISM metallicities. (See Equations 9 and 10 for the deﬁnitions of yandx, respectively.) The
least-squares linear ﬁt represented by the solid black line includes measurements for all of the elements available for a given line
of sight. The linear ﬁt represented by the dashed blue line ex cludes the refractory elements Ti, Ni, Cr, Fe, and B. The dott ed
black and dashed blue horizontal lines indicate the y-intercepts associated with the linear ﬁts represented by t he solid black and
dashed blue lines, respectively.15

of certain elements (and not others) due to speciﬁc nu-
cleosynthetic processes. There could also be unusual
ionization conditions in certain regions that appear to
enhance the abundances of dominant ions with large
ionization potentials.
For several sight lines in our sample with poor least-
squares linear ﬁts, a diﬀerent explanation seems more
likely. For the sight lines to HD 62542, HD 73882,
HD 121968, HD 195455, and HD 219188 (for example),
theyvaluesthat correspondto refractoryelements(e.g.,
Fe, Ni, and Ti) are much larger than would be expected
from an extrapolation of the trend seen for the more
volatile elements. The most likely explanation for this
behavior is that the stars in question probe multiple
interstellar regions with very diﬀerent depletion prop-erties along the same line of sight. In this scenario,
refractory elements will be heavily depleted relative to
volatile ones in interstellar clouds with large values of
F∗. However, these same elements will be signiﬁcantly
less depleted in clouds with much lower F∗values. Typ-
ically, the more depleted clouds will contain the bulk of
the hydrogen along the line of sight. This eﬀect will en-
hance the total sight-line column densities of refractory
elements since signiﬁcant portions of their gas-phase
abundances originatein regions with very little total hy-
drogen (e.g., see Savage et al. 1992 ;Sembach & Savage
1996;Savage & Sembach 1996 ;Welty et al. 1999 ).

aNumber of elemental abundance measurements included in the least-squares linear ﬁt.
A detailed abundance analysis by Welty et al. (2020)
conﬁrms this scenario for HD 62542. Those authors de-
rived abundances for a variety of diﬀerent atomic and
molecular species and reported total column densities
for two separate groups of components along the line of
sight. The main component near vLSR=−5 km s−1
is heavily depleted and is estimated to contain nearly
90% of the total hydrogen column density. All of the
other velocity components along the line of sight, which
constitute very little in terms of total hydrogen, show
much less depletion of refractory elements (e.g., see Fig-
ure 6 in Welty et al. 2020 ). If we had knowledge of
the amount of hydrogen contained in individual veloc-
ity components along lines of sight showing nonlinear
trends in yversusx, then we could conceivably derive
values of [M /H]ISMfor each component. Welty et al.
(2020) obtained estimates for the amount of hydrogen
present in the two groups of components observed to-
ward HD 62542 based, in part, on empirical correlationsbetween N(Hi),N(H2),N(Htot) and the abundances
of other interstellar constituents (e.g., CH, Na i, and the
diﬀuse interstellar band at 5780 ˚A). The issue with us-
ingasimilarapproachinthepresentinvestigationisthat
such correlations rely on implicit assumptions about the
metallicities in the clouds under consideration. If the
metallicity in a given parcel of gas is signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent from the typical ISM metallicity, then the usual
correlations would (presumably) no longer apply.
A simple solution to the problem of nonlinearity in
trends of yversusxis to perform a second set of least-
squares linear ﬁts in which the refractory elements are
excluded. In Figures 1–7, the dashed blue diagonal lines
represent linear ﬁts that exclude the elements Ti, Ni,
Cr, Fe, and B (all of which have AX<−1.2). The
dashed blue horizontal lines indicate the y-intercepts as-
sociated with these restricted ﬁts. The resulting values
of [M/H]ISMandF∗are againprovided in Table 5. With
this revised set of linear ﬁts, the median value of χ2/ν
is now 0.92 and there are fewer cases where the reduced24

panel) from HST/STIS observations of the O iλ1355, Mg iiλ1239, and Ni iiλ1317 lines and VLT/UVES observations of the
Tiiiλ3383 line. The column density scale applies to the O iproﬁle. Proﬁles for the other species have been scaled to acc ount
for diﬀerences in the cosmic abundances of the elements and t o adjust for the expected diﬀerences in the depletions of the
elements at a particular value of F∗. The adopted values of F∗(0.775 for HD 62542; 0.588 for HD 73882) correspond to the
values obtained from our linear ﬁts that include all of the av ailable elements.
χ2values are signiﬁcantly larger than 2. However, the
typical uncertainties in the derived values of [M /H]ISM
andF∗are larger for these ﬁts than for the original lin-
earﬁts (because therearefewer elements consideredand
the elements that are included in the ﬁts span a smaller
range in AX).
Ifwecompareforagivenlineofsightthelinearﬁtthat
includes all available elements to the linear ﬁt restricted
to non-refractory elements, we ﬁnd that, in general, the
restricted ﬁts result in steeper slopes (i.e., larger sight-
line depletion factors) and higher relative ISM metallic-
ities. In most cases, the diﬀerences in the outcomes
for [M/H]ISMandF∗between the two ﬁts are small
and within the uncertainties. Nevertheless, there does
appear to be a systematic shift toward steeper slopes
when the refractory elements are excluded. This indi-
catesthat the issuediscussedabove, wherealine ofsight
samples multiple distinct gas regions with diﬀerent de-
pletion properties, is fairly common, although in most
cases the eﬀect appears to be rather minor.
There are four sight lines where the diﬀerence in slope
between the linear ﬁts with and without the refractory
elements is larger than three times the associated uncer-
tainty and these sight lines have been mentioned before:
HD 62542, HD 73882, HD 121968, and HD 195455.
Both HD 62542 and HD 73882 are well-known ex-
amples of translucent sight lines (e.g., Snow et al.
2000;Rachford et al. 2002 ;Sonnentrucker et al. 2007 ;
Welty et al. 2020 ). The dominant velocity components
in these directions show heavy depletions. (Our ﬁts that
exclude refractoryelements indicate that F∗>1 in both
cases.) However, both sight lines also show additional
velocity components where the gas-phase abundances ofrefractory elements are enhanced (see Figure 8). The
other two sight lines showing large discrepancies in the
derived slope parameters are diﬀerent. Both HD 121968
and HD 195455 are located at high Galactic latitude.
(HD 121968 is the star that has the largest zdistance
in Table 1.) These two sight lines appear to probe a
combination of disk gas with moderate depletions and
halo gas with verylow depletions. In all four cases, how-
ever, it is the sampling of multiple distinct gas regions
with diﬀerent depletion properties that gives rise to the
nonlinear trends in plots of yversusx.
In Figure 8, we provide a demonstration of the ex-
treme diﬀerences in the velocity distributions of volatile
and refractory species toward HD 62542 and HD 73882.
In this ﬁgure, we plot the apparent column densities of
Oi, Mgii, Niii, and Ti iias a function of velocity. The
Mgii, Niii, and Tiiiproﬁles havebeen scaled to that of
Oi, accounting for diﬀerences in the cosmic abundances
of the elements (Table 4) and adjusting for the expected
diﬀerences in the depletions of the elements at a partic-
ular value of F∗. The adopted values of F∗(0.775 for
HD 62542; 0.588 for HD 73882) correspond to the val-
ues obtained from our linear ﬁts that include all of the
available elements in these directions.
Clearly, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the deple-
tion properties of the various gas components seen to-
ward HD 62542 and HD 73882. At the velocity of the
dominant absorption component in each direction, the
apparent column density proﬁle of O iis greatly en-
hancedcomparedtothoseofthemorerefractoryspecies.
Thisindicatesthatamuchlargervalueof F∗isneededto
characterize the absorption. Indeed, Welty et al. (2020)
ﬁnd a value of F∗≈1.5 for the main component toward25

ple of 84 sight lines with abundance measurements for at
least eight diﬀerent elements. These metallicities corres pond

of sight. The solid dark gray horizontal line indicates the
weighted mean metallicity of the sample ( −0.023±0.008),
while the light gray shaded region indicates the ( ±1σ)
weighted standard deviation (0.096 dex). The dashed hori-

HD 62542. This is similar to the value we obtain for this
sight line ( F∗≈1.4) from our linear ﬁt that excludes the
most refractory elements.
The velocity distributions of the more refractory
species toward HD 62542 and HD 73882 are much
broader (and show additional peaks) compared to the
relatively narrow O iproﬁles. The enhanced column
densities of refractory elements indicate that much
lower values of F∗are required for these additional
components. ( Welty et al. (2020) ﬁnd that a value of
F∗≈0.3 characterizes the “other” components toward
HD 62542.) However, the gas-phase abundances of Ni ii
and Tiiiare enhanced (relative to Mg ii) even at the
velocities of the dominant absorption components to-
ward HD 62542 and HD 73882. No single value of F∗
can simultaneously account for the observed column
densities of O i, Mgii, Niii, and Ti iiin these strongly-
depleted components. This could indicate that the
depletion strength increases with depth into the cloud
and/or that the diﬀerent species have diﬀerent volume
distributions at a given velocity. Regardless, the above
demonstration shows that the problem of nonlinearity
in plots of yversusxcan sometimes apply to individual
velocity components, and not just to lines of sight as a
whole.
4.3.Metallicity Distributions
The main objective of our investigation is to exam-
ine for a large representative sample the distribution
of metallicities seen along sight lines probing the localFigure 10. Distribution of relative ISM metallicities. These
metallicities correspond to the linear ﬁts that include all ele-
ments for a given line of sight. A Gaussian function is ﬁtted
to the observed distribution, which is represented by a his-
togram. The solid vertical line indicates the mean value fro m
the Gaussian ﬁt ( −0.020). The standard deviation from the
ﬁt is 0.098 dex. The dashed vertical line marks the location
of [M/H]ISM= 0.0.
Galactic ISM. While the method we employ is incapable
of providing us with the metallicity of the ISM relative
to an adopted solar (or cosmic) abundance standard, it
cantellusthedegreetowhichthemetallicityvariesfrom
one sight line to another. In Figure 9, the relative ISM
metallicities for the 84 sight lines in our ﬁnal sample are
plotted according to their rank. These are the metal-
licities derived from the least-squares linear ﬁts that in-
clude all elemental abundance measurements available
for a given line of sight. The weighted mean value of
[M/H]ISMfor this set ofmeasurements is −0.023±0.008.
(For this calculation, we have adopted weights that cor-
respond to the inverse squares of the measurement un-
certainties.) Since the metallicities being derived are
measured relative to the average ISM metallicity (Sec-
tion2), one would expect this mean value to be close to
zero. (It need not be exactly zero, of course, since the
sample of stars examined in the present survey diﬀers
from those originally used to derive the element coef-
ﬁcients;Jenkins 2009 ;Ritchey et al. 2018 ,2023). Still,
the mean value given above is consistent with zero at
only the 3 σlevel. The reason for this discrepancy may
be that the linear ﬁts that include all elements tend
to underestimate the slope of the trend of yversusx
because the refractory elements have slightly enhanced
gas-phaseabundancesrelativetovolatileswhenthesight
line probesmultiple distinct regionswith diﬀerentdeple-
tion properties.
A statistic more important than the mean value in
this context is the standard deviation, which should in-26

correspond to the linear ﬁts that exclude the refractory el-

dicate the degree of chemical homogeneity exhibited by
the interstellar gas in the solar neighborhood. For the
linear ﬁts that include all of the available elements, the
weighted standard deviation in [M /H]ISMis 0.096 dex.
This may be compared to the median of the uncertain-
ties in [M /H]ISM, which is 0.078 dex. To test whether
the measured dispersion in [M /H]ISMis signiﬁcant, we
can calculate a χ2value for the sample:
χ2=N/summationdisplay
i=1([M/H]ISM,i−/angbracketleft[M/H]ISM/angbracketright)2
σ([M/H]ISM,i)2,(15)
where [M /H]ISM,iis the metallicity for the ith sight line,
σ([M/H]ISM,i) is the uncertainty in that measurement,
/angbracketleft[M/H]ISM/angbracketrightis the weighted mean value derived above,
andNis the number of measurements. For the linear
ﬁts that include all of the available abundance measure-
ments, the χ2value, divided by the number of degrees
of freedom, is 132 .1/83 = 1.59. Under the proposition
that all sight lines have the same value of [M /H]ISM,
the probability of obtaining a χ2statistic worse than
this is 0.000495. Evidently, there is a small amount of
scatter that is unaccounted for by the observational un-
certainties (or the observational uncertainties have been
underestimated). In Figure 10, we plot the metallic-
ity distribution derived from the unrestricted linear ﬁts.
A Gaussian function is ﬁtted to the observed distribu-
tion. Themeanandstandarddeviationderivedfromthe
Gaussianﬁt areboth nearlyequal tothe values obtained
directly from the sample. However, the distribution ap-
pears to be somewhat irregular. In particular, there is
a pileup in the number of sight lines with metallicities
that are ∼0.09 dex below average.Figure 12. Same as Figure 10except that the metallici-
ties correspond to the linear ﬁts that exclude the refractor y
elements Ti, Ni, Cr, Fe, and B. The mean value from the
Gaussian ﬁt in this case is +0 .020, while the standard devi-
ation is 0.100 dex.
The excess scatter in the values of [M /H]ISMobtained
from the unrestricted linear ﬁts seems to arise from the
varying degrees of nonlinearity observed in the trends
ofyversusxdisplayed in Figures 1–7. Ultimately, the
cause of this variation is the extent to which diﬀerent
sight lines are contaminated by gas regions with deple-
tion properties that are distinctly diﬀerent from that
which characterizes the bulk of the interstellar material
along the line of sight. As an example, consider a sight
line that probes a typical heavily-depleteddiﬀuse molec-
ular cloud but is contaminated by unrelated gas regions
exhibiting much lower depletion strengths. In this case,
the total gas-phase abundances of refractory elements
will be enhanced relative to volatiles, and a linear ﬁt
that includes all elements will underpredict the slope
andy-intercept that pertain to the dominant interstel-
lar cloud. For a sight line such as that described here, a
ﬁt that excludes the refractory elements will provide a
more accurate representation of the depletion strength
and the relative ISM metallicity. (Extreme examples
of this phenomenon are provided by the sight lines to
HD 62542 and HD 73882; see Figures 2and8.)
In Figure 11, we provide a plot analogous to Figure 9
showing the relative ISM metallicities derived from the
linear ﬁts that exclude the elements Ti, Ni, Cr, Fe, and
B. The weighted mean value of [M /H]ISMfor this set
of measurements is +0 .009±0.010, while the weighted
standard deviation is 0.093 dex. The mean value, there-
fore, is now statistically indistinguishable from zero and
the standard deviation is somewhat smaller compared
to the previous set of results. As stated earlier, the typ-
ical uncertainty in the derivations of [M /H]ISMis larger
for the ﬁts restricted to non-refractory elements. Con-27
sequently, the median of the uncertainty values (0.091
dex) is now almost identical to the weighted standard
deviation (0.093 dex). From Equation (15), we ﬁnd
that the χ2/νvalue for this set of measurements is
83.9/83 = 1.01, indicating that there is essentially no
measured variation in [M /H]ISMbeyond that which is
expected from the observational uncertainties. (The
probability of obtaining a worse value for the χ2statis-
tic in this case is 0.451.) The analog of Figure 10for
the metallicities derived from the restricted linear ﬁts is
shown in Figure 12. As in the previous case, the mean
and standard deviation of a Gaussian function ﬁtted to
the observed distribution are consistent with the values
determined directly from the sample. However, the dis-
tribution of[M /H]ISMvaluesfor this set ofresults is now
noticably more regular.
Regardless of which set of derivations of [M /H]ISMis
considered, our results provide strong evidence for the
chemical homogeneity of the interstellar gas in the solar
neighborhood. Any metallicity variations present must
be smaller than the typical measurement uncertainties.
These results stand in sharp contrast to those presented
byDe Cia et al. (2021). Importantly, we see no evi-
dence for very low metallicity gas (such as that reported
inDe Cia et al. 2021 ) along any of the 84 sight lines in
our sample. A detailed comparison between the metal-
licity derivations presented in this work and those of
De Cia et al. (2021) is provided in Section 5.1.
5.DISCUSSION
The most signiﬁcant result of our analysis of rela-
tive ISM metallicities is that the spread in metallici-
ties exhibited by the sight lines in our sample is small
and only slightly larger than the typical measurement
uncertainties. Most of the column density measure-
ments used in our metallicity analysis were derived from
moderate strength atomic transitions (e.g., O iλ1355,
Mgiiλλ1239,1240, P iiλ1532, Ti iiλ3383, Mn ii
λλ1197,1201, Ni iiλ1317, Cu iiλ1358, Ge iiλ1237,
and Kr iλ1235) recorded at high spectral resolution
(∆v∼2–4 km s−1). It is relatively straightforward to
extract accurate column densities from such data using
either the AOD or proﬁle ﬁtting method.4Furthermore,
our sample is both large enough to be statistically sig-
niﬁcant and diverse enough to be representative of the
4Asmallfraction( ∼11%)ofthe measurements used inouranal-
ysis were derived from low-resolution FUSE observations. H ow-
ever, in these cases, the column densities are adequately co n-
strained through the use of curves of growth that include ver y
weak transitions (e.g., Jensen et al. 2007 ;Jensen & Snow 2007 )
or through Voigt proﬁle ﬁtting of weak lines, adopting compo nent
structures from higher resolution data (e.g., Ritchey et al. 2023 ).local Galactic ISM. The inclusion of a wide variety of
elements that exhibit a range of diﬀerent depletion be-
haviors ensures that our linear ﬁts are well constrained
(even when the more refractory elements are excluded).
It is also important to note that the elements consid-
ered in our investigation are produced through a vari-
ety of diﬀerent nucleosynthetic processes. (For example,
we have representatives of α-process elements, Fe-group
elements, neutron-capture elements, and elements pro-
duced through cosmic ray spallation.) This helps to en-
sure that we are probing variations in the overall metal-
licity andarenotoverlyinﬂuenced byanypotentialvari-
ations in one process or another.
5.1.Comparison with the Results of De Cia et al.
De Cia et al. (2021) reported relative ISM metallic-
ities for a sample of 25 sight lines probing the solar
neighborhood out to a distance of 3 kpc. Most of
their column density measurements were made using
newly-acquired medium-resolution (E230M) STIS spec-
tra. (STIS E230M spectra have a velocity resolution of
∼10 km s−1).De Cia et al. (2021) derive metallicity es-
timates for their sight lines using two approaches. The
one that they term the “ F∗method” is the same as that
adopted in this investigation(see Section 2). Thus, a di-
rect comparison of results is possible for any sight lines
in common between our investigation and theirs.5
There are eight sight lines in common between our
metallicity study and that of De Cia et al. (2021):
HD 23180 ( oPer), HD 24534 (X Per), HD 62542,
HD 73882, HD 147933 ( ρOph A), HD 149404,
HD 206267, and HD 207198. In every case, our value for
the relative ISM metallicity is substantially larger than
the value givenby De Cia et al. (2021). (The diﬀerences
range from 0.2 to 0.8 dex.) The largest discrepancies
are found for the sight lines to X Per, HD 62542, and
HD 73882, ρOph A, and HD 207198. These are among
the sight lines with the lowest reported metallicities in
De Cia et al. (2021) and many of these sight lines show
nonlinear trends in plots of yversusx.De Cia et al.
(2021) underestimate the metallicities in these direc-
tions primarily because they derive their estimates from
only the most refractory elements, and these elements
tend to exhibit shallower slopes (in the x-yplane) com-
pared to the more volatile elements.

tion andthatof De Cia et al. (2021) canbemadeforthe

lineofsighttoXPer. Forthis sightline, wehavecolumn
density measurements for all 22 elements considered in
ourmetallicityanalysis. Theuncertaintiesinthederived
values of [M /H]ISMandF∗are thus among the smallest
for this direction. De Cia et al. (2021) ﬁnd a depletion-
corrected metallicity of [M /H] =−0.57±0.12 and a
sight-line depletion factor of F∗= 0.61±0.09 toward
X Per. However, their least-squares linear ﬁt includes
only Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn. Abundance results for C,
N, and O are plotted in the panel showing their linear
ﬁt for X Per (see Extended Data Fig. 3 in De Cia et al.
2021) but these elements arenot included in the ﬁt. The
yvalues for these volatile elements are clearly displaced
upwardrelative to the ﬁtted line that correspondsto the
more refractory elements. Thus, if the volatile elements
had been included in the ﬁt, the slope of the ﬁtted line
would be steeper and the y-intercept (i.e., the metallic-
ity) would be much larger.
From our least-squares linear ﬁt that includes all 22
elements measured toward X Per, we ﬁnd [M /H]ISM=
+0.011±0.055 and F∗= 1.045±0.050 (Figure 1; Ta-
ble5). Thus, the metallicity is indistinguishable from
the average ISM metallicity, and the sight-line deple-
tion factor is approximately equal to one, as would be
expected for X Per, which is a well-known translucent
sight line. When the refractory elements are excluded
from the ﬁt, we ﬁnd [M /H]ISM= +0.155±0.068 and
F∗= 1.285±0.093. Thus, this appears to be another
casewhere the dominant interstellarcloud alongthe line
of sight shows heavy depletions, but there are additional
components where the gas-phase abundances of refrac-
tory elements are enhanced. (The slope parameters ob-
tained from the two diﬀerent linear ﬁts for X Per diﬀer
at only the 2 σlevel, however.)
Regardless of which of our linear ﬁts one considers
to be the most appropriate, our result for the relative
ISMmetallicitytowardXPerisconsiderablylargerthan
that obtained by De Cia et al. (2021). There are two
mainreasonsforthisdiscrepancy. First, asalreadymen-
tioned, the volatile elements (C, N, and O) are excluded
from the De Cia et al. (2021) analysis. Second, the
Zniicolumn density reported by De Cia et al. (2021)
underestimates the true column density by ∼0.35 dex.
De Cia et al. (2021) report a value of log N(Znii) =
13.13±0.04, which they obtain by integrating the AOD
proﬁles of the Zn iiλ2026 and λ2062 lines seen in
medium-resolution STIS echelle spectra.6Our result
6The value quoted here for log N(Znii) fromDe Cia et al.
(2021) includes an adjustment of +0.10 dex to account for the
diﬀerence in the adopted f-values of the Zn iilines between our
investigation and theirs. However, as mentioned in Section 3.1,Figure 13. Comparison between high-resolution (E230H)
and medium-resolution (E230M) STIS spectra covering the

of logN(Znii) = 13.48±0.07 is derived from high-
resolution (E230H) STIS observationsof the Zn iiλ2062
line (the weaker member of the Zn iidoublet) using a
Voigt proﬁle ﬁtting technique. In this ﬁt, the compo-
nent structure of the relatively strong Zn iiλ2062 line is
constrained by the results for other dominant ions with
more moderate strength transitions (for more details see
A. M. Ritchey, in preparation).
The danger of extracting column densities from rel-
atively strong interstellar absorption lines observed at
moderate resolution using the AOD method is illus-
trated in Figure 13. In this ﬁgure, we compare the
appearance of the Zn iiλ2062 line toward X Per in
medium-resolution and high-resolution STIS echelle
spectra. The E230H spectrum clearly shows that the
Zniiline is heavily saturated despite the fact that,
in the E230M spectrum, the line has a “pointed” ap-
pearance and the relative intensity at line center is
far from zero. A straight integration of the line gives
logN(Znii) = 13.17 for the E230H spectrum and
12.91 for E230M, while the integrated equivalent widths
are nearly the same (58.5 and 58.9 m ˚A, respectively).
De Cia et al. (2021) apply a correction to their inte-
grated Zn iicolumn densities, based on the prescription
ofJenkins(1996), arriving at a value of 13.13 for X Per.
However, it appears that the optical depth correction is
inadequate in this case since the integrated value from
the E230H spectrum (13.17) represents a lower limit to
the true column density.
the diﬀerence in the f-values does not aﬀect the outcome for
[M/H]ISM.29
The Zniicolumn densities measured by De Cia et al.
(2021) have a signiﬁcant impact on their determinations
of metallicities since Zn represents one of the endpoints
oftheirlinearﬁts (theotherendpointbeing Ti). Ifmany
of their Zn iicolumn densities are underestimated, as
demonstrated here for X Per, then their metallicities
are also underestimated. Indeed, by comparing the pre-
dicted values of yfor Zn (based on our linear ﬁts) to the
valuesreportedby De Cia et al. (2021)forthesightlines
in common, we ﬁnd that De Cia et al. (2021) appear to
have underestimated the Zn iicolumn densities by 0.1
to 0.6 dex depending on the sight line. The larger issue
with the De Cia et al. (2021) analysis, however, is that
their linearﬁts do not include anyofthe relativelyunde-
pletedelements(suchasC,N,OandKr)despitethefact
that measurements for these elements are readily avail-
able for many of their sight lines. Most of the volatile
element measurements (shown in Extended Data Fig. 3
inDe Cia et al. 2021 ) are displaced upward relative to
the ﬁtted lines that correspond to the more refractory
elements. Had these volatile elements been included in
their ﬁts, the slopes would generally be steeper and the
derived metallicities would be higher.
De Cia et al. (2021) address the discrepancy in their
results between the volatile elements and the refractory
ones. The same nonlinearity in plots of yversusxis
seen for many of the sight lines in our investigation
(Section 4.2). However, De Cia et al. (2021) attribute
the discrepancy to a mixture of solar metallicity gas
and very low metallicity (pristine) gas along the same
line of sight.7The problem with this interpretation is
that it is purely speculative. Let us consider once again
the situation where a line of sight passes through a dif-
fuse molecular cloud characterized by heavy depletions
but also samples gas regions with much lower depletion
strengths. According to our interpretation, the heav-
ily depleted cloud contains the bulk of the hydrogen
along the line of sight. The other components consti-
tute very little in terms of total hydrogen yet much of
thegas-phaseabundancesofrefractoryelementsarecon-
tained in those minor components. De Cia et al. (2021)
would argue that those gas regions with lower deple-
tion strengths also have much lower metallicities. How-
ever, there is no evidence to support this assertion. The
problem is that we are unable to directly determine
what fraction of the total hydrogen column density is
associated with each of the various line-of-sight compo-
nents. The De Cia et al. (2021) interpretation implies
that a large fraction of the total hydrogen column den-

sity should be attributed to those components showing
weaker depletions. However, a simpler (and we would
arguemorelikely)explanationisthatthe metallicitiesin
the various line-of-sight components are roughly equiv-
alent whereas the physical conditions (and hence the
depletion strengths) are the quantities that vary from
one gas region to the next.
5.2.Metallicity Variations in the Galactic Disk
Having completed our examination of the distribu-
tion of metallicities in the neutral ISM, it is instruc-
tive to compare our results to those obtained from
other tracers of metallicity in the Galactic disk. Re-
cently,Esteban et al. (2022) presented a comparison of
the metallicity distributions derived from studies of H ii
regions, neutral clouds, B stars, Cepheids, and young
clusters. The dispersions in the metallicities derived
from Hiiregions ( Arellano-C´ ordova et al. 2020 ,2021),
Bstars(Nieva & Przybilla2012 ), Cepheids( Luck2018 ),
and young clusters ( Donor et al. 2020 ) within 3 kpc
of the Sun are all similar to one another and are all
/lessorsimilar0.10 dex. For neutral clouds, Esteban et al. (2022)
cite the results of De Cia et al. (2021) ﬁnding that only
in this case is the dispersion in metallicity much larger
(∼0.28 dex). If our more extensive survey of neutral
cloud metallicities were considered instead, the disper-
sion would be ∼0.10 dex (Section 4.3), similar to the30
values obtained from other constituents of the Galactic
disk.
In Figure 14, we plot the (relative) metallicities de-
rived for a sample of H iiregions located within 4
kpc of the Sun ( Arellano-C´ ordova et al. 2020 ,2021)
against the Galactocentric distances of those H iire-
gions (M´ endez-Delgado et al. 2022 ). The plotted values
are the total oxygen abundances of the ionized nebulae
normalized by the oxygen abundance at the solar circle
(i.e., atRG= 8.2 kpc). The diagonal dashed line in the
ﬁgure, which was used to determine this oﬀset, indicates
the radial abundance gradient that pertains to the H ii
regions.8Also shown in Figure 14are the relative ISM
metallicities derived in this work for sight lines prob-
ing neutral clouds in the solar neighborhood (out to 4
kpc). (For this ﬁgure, we adopt the values of [M /H]ISM
obtained from the ﬁts that exclude the refractory ele-
ments.) There is no evidence of an abundance gradient
from our determinations of [M /H]ISM, as shown by the
light gray dashed line in the ﬁgure. However, the over-
all dispersion in the relative metallicities of the neutral
clouds is similar to that of the H iiregions within 4 kpc
of the Sun.
An important caveat regarding the comparison of rel-
ative metallicities shown in Figure 14is that, in general,
the distances to the interstellar clouds seen in absorp-
tion toward background stars are not the same as the
distances to the stars themselves. In contrast, the H ii
regions are actually located at the Galactocentric dis-
tances plotted in the ﬁgure (or presumably so within
the uncertainties). Typically, the dominant absorption
components toward the stars in our survey are found
nearvLSR= 0 km s−1. While many of the more dis-
tant stars exhibit multiple absorption complexes, cor-
responding to gas in diﬀerent spiral arms (such as the
Sagittarius-Carinaspiralarmorthe Perseusspiralarm),
the “local arm” component near vLSR= 0 km s−1is
usually the strongest. This suggests that much of the
interstellar material along the various sight lines in our
survey is (kinematically) close to the Sun, regardless of
the distance to the background star. This may then
explain why no abundance gradient is apparent in the
metallicity data presented here for neutral clouds.
8We plot relative metallicities for the H iiregions in Figure 14
so that the values can be more directly compared to our result s
for neutral clouds. Also, in this way, we avoid the so-called “abun-
dance discrepancy problem”, where the abundances obtained from
collisionally excited lines in ionized nebulae are systema tically
lower than the abundances derived from recombination lines . The
abundance discrepancy for O may explain why the H iiregion O
abundances are oﬀset from the solar value by ∼0.2 dex (e.g., see
Arellano-C´ ordova et al. 2020 ;Esteban et al. 2022 ).6.CONCLUSIONS
In this investigation, we have presented an analysis of
relative ISM metallicities for a sample of 84 sight lines
probing diﬀuse neutral gas in the solar neighborhood
out to a maximum heliocentric distance of 4 kpc. The
methodology we employ was ﬁrst proposed by Jenkins
(2009) as a means to study the dust depletions and
metallicities in high redshift absorption systems. The
essence of this approach is to compare the pattern of
relative abundances seen for a variety of elements in a
given direction to the expected trends due to the deple-
tion of atoms from the gas-phase onto interstellar dust
grains. This comparison then yields the overall strength
ofdepletionalongthelineofsightandwhethertheabun-
dances collectively are higher or lower than the average
interstellar abundances. While this method cannot pro-
vide the metallicity of the ISM with respect to some
adopted cosmic abundance standard, it can yield use-
ful information on the spread in the metallicites that
pertain to neutral gas in the solar neighborhood.
To accomplish our objective ofdetermining the metal-
licity distribution for a representative sample of sight
lines probing the local Galactic ISM, we compiled a
database of high-quality column density measurements
reported in the literature for 22 elements that had pre-
viously been analyzed in accordance with the methodol-
ogy devised by Jenkins(2009). The vast majority of
column density measurements used in the metallicity
analysis were derived from observations acquired with
STIS or GHRS. However, for some elements (i.e., N,
Cl, and Fe), many of the column densities adopted here
were obtained from lower resolution FUSE spectra. The
column density measurements adopted for Ti were de-
rived using a variety of ground-based instruments, such
as VLT/UVES. We supplemented the literature survey
with new column density determinations for certain key
elements (e.g., Ti and Ni) and for several interesting
and/or important sight lines (see Section 3.2).
In order to properly constrain the least-squares linear
ﬁts that yielded values of [M /H]ISM, we required that
each line of sight have column density measurements
for at least eight diﬀerent elements. An initial inspec-
tion of the linear ﬁts revealed a persistent nonlinearity
in the trends of yversusxthat would cause the slope
andy-intercept of the ﬁt to be underestimated. We at-
tribute this nonlinearity to a situation where a line of
sight passes through multiple distinct gas regions with
diﬀerent depletion properties. A simple solution was to
exclude the most refractory elements from the linear ﬁts
so as to obtain the depletion strength and metallicity for
the bulk of the material along the line of sight.31
Regardless of the set of relative ISM metallicities that
is considered (Table 5), the results of our analysis are
clear. The dispersion in the metallicities that pertain
to neutral gas in the solar neighborhood is small ( ∼0.10
dex) and only slightly larger than the typical measure-
ment uncertainties. These results stand in sharp con-
trast to those presented by De Cia et al. (2021), who
reportedmetallicitiesaslowas −0.76dex, ameanmetal-
licity of −0.26 dex, and a dispersion of 0.28 dex for a
sample of 25 sight lines. We ﬁnd no evidence for the ex-
istence of very low metallicity ([M /H]/lessorsimilar−0.3 dex) gas
along any of the 84 sight lines in our survey. There
are eight sight lines in common between our investi-
gation and that of De Cia et al. (2021). In each case,
our value for the relative ISM metallicity is substan-
tially larger (by 0.2 to 0.8 dex) compared to the value
given in De Cia et al. (2021). The reason for these dis-
crepancies is that there are serious ﬂaws in the analy-
sis undertaken by De Cia et al. (2021). The Zn iicol-
umn densities reported by De Cia et al. (2021) arelikely
underestimated since they are based on integrated col-
umn densities derived using relatively strong absorption
features recorded at moderate resolution. A more se-
rious concern is that the metallicity determinations in
De Cia et al. (2021) are based on linear ﬁts that include
only the most refractory elements. Volatile elements,
whicharebetter tracersofmetallicityin thediﬀuse ISM,
are excluded from their analysis even though they yield
conﬂicting results.The dispersion in the metallicities that we obtain for
sight lines probing the neutral ISM is similar to the val-
ues reportedforothertracersofmetallicity inthe Galac-
tic disk. The metallicitydistributions forneutralclouds,
Hiiregions,Bstars, Cepheids, andyoungclustersin the
solar neighborhood all have dispersions of ∼0.10 dex or
lower. Together, these results provide strong observa-
tionalsupportforawell-mixed,chemicallyhomogeneous
ISM in the vicinity of the Sun.
We note the passing of our scientiﬁc colleague, Prof.
Blair Savage, on July 19, 2022 in Madison, WI. Blair
was a majorﬁgure in UV space astronomywho, with his
students, postdocs, andcolleagues,madeseminalcontri-
butions to studies of gas and dust in the interstellar and
intergalactic medium. We thank Dan Welty for provid-
ing useful comments on an early draft of this paper. We
also thank the anonymousreferee forhelpful suggestions
that improved our analysis. This research has made use
of the SIMBAD database operated at CDS, Strasbourg,
France. Observations were obtained from the ESO Sci-
ence Archive Facility and the MAST data archive at the
Space Telescope Science Institute. STScI is operated by
the Association of Universities for Research in Astron-
omy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.

APPENDIX
A.COMPILATION OF COLUMN DENSITY MEASUREMENTS FOR METAL IONS
A complete compilation of the column densities used in the metallicity ana lysis (described in Section 4) for elements
other than hydrogen is provided in Table 6. For each entry in the table, we provide the reference for the colu mn density
measurement (see codes listed in Table 3), the instrument that recorded the spectrum, and the method u sed in the
analysis. The instrument codes include FUSE, GHRS, OPT, STIS, and UVES (where OPT refers to any ground-based
optical telescope other than VLT/UVES). The method codes includ e AOD, COG, FIT, LDW, and WLL (which are
explained in a footnote to Table 6). Note that in some cases a combination of instruments and/or met hods were used.
All column densities listed in Table 6have been adjusted so as to be consistent with the set of f-values provided in
Table2.
In Table 7, we provide additional details regarding the column density measure ments newly-derived in this investi-
gation (see Section 3.2). In particular, we provide the equivalent widths ( Wλ) and column densities of the individual
transitions analyzed in each direction. All of the results listed in Table 7(except those for Ti ii) were derived from
high-resolution (E140H or E230H) STIS spectra using either the AO D or proﬁle ﬁtting method. The Ti iicolumn
densities were extracted from archival VLT/UVES spectra using t he AOD approach. In cases where multiple transi-
tions from the same species were analyzed, ﬁnal column densities we re obtained by taking the weighted mean of the
individual results. The ﬁnal column densities in these cases are prov ided in Table 6.
