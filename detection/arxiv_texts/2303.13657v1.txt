Abstract
Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) enhances the understanding of the effects of the ran-
domness in the environment by letting agents learn the distribution of a random return, rather than
its expected value as in standard RL. At the same time, a main challenge in DRL is that policy
evaluation in DRL typically relies on the representation of the return distribution, which needs to
be carefully designed. In this paper, we address this challenge for a special class of DRL problems
that rely on discounted linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for control, advocating for a new distribu-
tional approach to LQR, which we call distributional LQR . Speciﬁcally, we provide a closed-form
expression of the distribution of the random return which, remarkably, is applicable to all exoge-
nous disturbances on the dynamics, as long as they are independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.). While the proposed exact return distribution consists of inﬁnitely many random variables,
we show that this distribution can be approximated by a ﬁnite number of random variables, and the
associated approximation error can be analytically bounded under mild assumptions. Using the ap-
proximate return distribution, we propose a zeroth-order policy gradient algorithm for risk-averse
LQR using the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a measure of risk. Numerical experiments are
provided to illustrate our theoretical results.
Keywords: Distributional LQR, distributional RL, policy evaluation, risk-averse control
1. Introduction
In reinforcement learning, the value of implementing a policy at a given state is captured by a value
function, which models the expected sum of returns following this prescribed policy. Recently,
Bellemare et al. (2017) proposed the notion of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL), which
learns the return distribution of a policy from a given state, instead of only its expected return.
Compared to the scalar expected value function, the return distribution is inﬁnite-dimensional and
contains far more information. It is, therefore, not surprising that a few DRL algorithms, including
C51 (Bellemare et al., 2017), D4PG (Barth-Maron et al., 2018), QR-DQN (Dabney et al., 2018b)
and SDPG (Singh et al., 2022), dramatically improve the empirical performance in practical appli-
cations over their non-distributional counterpart.

In DRL, the practical effectiveness of algorithms builds on the theory by Bellemare et al. (2017),
where the distributional Bellman operator is shown to be a contraction in the (maximum form of) the
Wasserstein metric between probability distributions. However, it is usually difﬁcult to characterise
the exact return distribution in DRL with ﬁnite data. Approximations of the return distribution
are thus necessary to make it computable in practice. To address this challenge, Bellemare et al.
(2017) propose a categorical method that partitions the return distribution into a ﬁnite number of
uniformly spaced atoms in a ﬁxed region. One drawback of this method is that it relies on prior
knowledge of the range of the returned values. To address this limitation, a quantile function method
(Dabney et al., 2018b) and a sample-based method (Singh et al., 2022) have been recently proposed.
However, these works cannot provide an analytical expression for the approximation error, and
computational cost needs to be decided manually to guarantee approximation accuracy.
In this paper, we characterise the return distribution of the random cost for the classical dis-
counted linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem, which we term distributional LQR . To the best
of our knowledge, the return distribution in LQR has not been explored in the literature. Our con-
tributions are summarised as follows:
1. We provide an analytical expression of the random return for distributional LQR problems and
prove that this return function is a ﬁxed-point solution of the distributional Bellman equation.
Speciﬁcally, we show that the proposed analytical expression consists of inﬁnitely many ran-
dom variables and holds for arbitrary i.i.d. exogenous disturbances, e.g., non-Gaussian noise
or noise with non-zero mean.
2. We develop an approximation of the distribution of the random return using a ﬁnite number
of random variables. Under mild assumptions, we theoretically show that the sup of the
difference between the exact and approximated return distributions deceases linearly with the
numbers of random variables: this is also validated by numerical experiments.
3. The proposed analytical return distribution provides a theoretical foundation for distributional
LQR, allowing for general optimality criteria for policy improvement. In this work, we em-
ploy the return distribution to analyse risk-averse LQR problems using the Conditional Value
at Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure. Since the gradient of CVaR is generally difﬁcult to
compute analytically, we propose a risk-averse policy gradient algorithm that relies on the
zeroth-order optimisation to seek an optimal risk-averse policy. Numerical experiments are
provided to showcase this application.
Related Work: Most closely related to the problem considered in this paper is work on reinforce-
ment learning for LQR, which focuses on learning the expected return through interaction with the
environment; see, e.g., Dean et al. (2020); Tu and Recht (2018); Fazel et al. (2018); Malik et al.
(2019); Li et al. (2021); Yaghmaie et al. (2022); Zheng et al. (2021). For example, Fazel et al.
(2018) propose a model-free policy gradient algorithm for LQR and showed its global convergence
with ﬁnite polynomial computational and sample complexity. Moreover, Zheng et al. (2021) study
model-based reinforcement learning for the Linear Quadratic Gaussian problems, in which a model
is ﬁrst learnt from data and then used to design the policy. However, all these works rely on the
expected return instead of the return distribution, hence these methods cannot be applied here.
Since the return distribution captures the intrinsic randomness of the long-term cost, it provides
a natural framework to consider more general optimality criteria, e.g., optimal risk-averse poli-
cies. There exist recent works on risk-averse policy design for DRL, including Singh et al. (2020);
2POLICY EVALUATION IN DISTRIBUTIONAL LQR
Dabney et al. (2018a); Tang et al. (2019). For example, the work in Dabney et al. (2018a) use
the quantile function to approximate the return distribution, which is then applied to design risk-
sensitive policies for Atari games. On the other hand, Singh et al. (2020) show that risk-averse DRL
achieves robustness against system disturbances in continuous control tasks. All these works focus
on empirical improvements in speciﬁc tasks, however, without theoretical analysis. Related to this
paper is also work on risk-sensitive LQR, which has been studied in Van Parys et al. (2015); Tsiamis
et al. (2021); Kim and Yang (2021); Chapman and Lessard (2021); Kishida and Cetinkaya (2022).
Similarly, these methods however do not analyse the return distribution.
2. Problem Statement
Consider a discrete-time linear dynamical system:
xt+1=Axt+But+vt; (1)
wherext2Rn,ut2Rp,vt2Rnare the system state, control input, and the exogenous distur-
bance, respectively. We assume that the exogenous disturbances vtwith bounded moments, t2N,
are i.i.d. sampled from a distribution Dof arbitrary form.
2.1. Classical LQR
The canonical LQR problem aims to ﬁnd a control policy :Rn!Rpto minimise the objective
J(u) =E"1X
t=0t(xT
tQxt+uT
tRut)#
; (2)
whereQ;R are positive-deﬁnite constant matrices and 2(0;1)is a discount parameter. Given a
control policy , letV(x) =EP1
t=0k(xT
tQxt+uT
tRut)
denote the expected return from an
initial statex0=xwithut=(xt). For the static linear policy (xt) =Kxt, the value function
V(x)satisﬁes the Bellman equation
V(x) =xT(Q+KTRK)x+ E
X0=(A+BK)x+v0[V(X0)]; (3)
where the capital letter X0denotes a random variable over which we take the expectation.
When the exogenous disturbances vtare normally distributed with zero mean, the value function
is known to take the quadratic form V(x) =xTPx+q, whereP > 0is the solution of the
Lyapunov equation P=Q+KTRK+AT
KPAKandqis a scalar related to the variance of vt. In
particular, the optimal control feedback gain is obtained as K= (R+BTPB) 1PAandPis
the solution to the classic Riccati equation P=ATPA 2ATPB(R+BTPB) 1BTPA+Q.
2.2. Distributional LQR
Motivated by the advantages of DRL in better understanding the effects of the randomness in the
environment and in considering more general optimality criteria, in this paper we propose a distri-
butional approach to the LQR problem. Unlike classical reinforcement learning, which relies on
expected returns, DRL (Bellemare et al., 2023) relies on the distribution of random returns. The
return distribution characterises the probability distribution of different returns generated by a given
3POLICY EVALUATION IN DISTRIBUTIONAL LQR
policy and, as such, it contains much richer information on the performance of a given policy com-
pared to the expected return. In the context of LQR, we denote by G(x)the random return using
the static control strategy ut=(xt)from the initial state x0=x, which is deﬁned as
G(x) =1X
t=0t(xT
tQxt+uT
tRut); ut=(xt);x0=x: (4)
It is straightforward to see that the expectation of G(x)is equivalent to the value function V(x).
The standard Bellman equation in (3) decomposes the long-term expected return into an immediate
stage cost plus the expected return of future actions starting at the next step. Similarly, we can deﬁne
the distributional Bellman equation for the random return as
G(x)D=xTQx+(x)TR(x) +G(X0); X0=Ax+B(x) +v0: (5)
Here we use the notationD=to denote that two random variables Z1;Z2are equal in distribution,
i.e.,Z1D=Z2. Note thatX0denotes a random variable, as in (3). Compared to the expected return in
LQR, which is a scalar, here the return distribution is inﬁnite-dimensional and can have a complex
form. It is challenging to estimate an inﬁnite-dimensional function exactly with ﬁnite data and thus
an approximation of the return distribution is necessary in practice.
In this paper, we ﬁrst analytically characterise the random return for the LQR problem. Then
we show how to approximate the distribution of the random return using ﬁnite random variables,
so such that the approximated distribution is computationally tractable and the approximation error
is bounded. The proposed distributional LQR framework allows us to consider more general opti-
mality criteria, which we demonstrate by using the proposed return distribution to develop a policy
gradient algorithm for risk-averse LQR.
3. Main Results
3.1. Exact Form of the Return Distribution
In this section, we precisely characterise the distribution of the random return that satisﬁes the
distributional Bellman equation (5). Given a static linear policy (xt) =Kxt, we denote by GK(x)
the random return G(x)under the policy (xt)from the initial state x0=x, which is deﬁned as
GK(x) =1X
t=0txT
t(Q+KTRK)xt; x 0=x:
The random return GK(x)satisﬁes the following distributional Bellman equation
GK(x)D=xTQKx+GK(X0); X0=AKx+v0; (6)
whereAK:=A+BK andQK:=Q+KTRK. In the following theorem, we provide an explicit
expression of the random return GK(x).

Remark 3 The bound on the distribution approximation in (10) relies on the conditions of Theo-
rem 2, which ensure that the PDF of GK
Nis continuous and bounded. Note that these conditions
are not particularly strict, and indeed hold for many noise distributions commonly used in linear
dynamical systems, including Gaussian and uniform. Future work will investigate relaxations of
these conditions.
3.3. Numerical Experiments on Quality of the Approximation of the Return Distribution
In the following experiment, we consider a scalar model with matrices A=B= 1. Similarly, the
weighting matrices in the LQR cost are chosen as Q=R= 1. The exogenous disturbances are
standard normal distributions with zero mean.
Even for this scalar system, it is impossible to simplify the expression of the exact return distri-
bution, which still depends on an inﬁnite number of random variables. Thus, as a baseline for the
return distribution, we generate an empirical distribution that approximates the true distribution of
the random return. More speciﬁcally, we use the Monte Carlo (MC) method to obtain 10000 samples
of the random return and use the sample frequency over evenly-divided regions as an approximation
of the probability density function. According to the law of large numbers, the empirical distribution
approaches the real one as the number of trials increases. Note that, although the MC method pro-
vides an alternative way to approximate the return distribution, it relies on using sufﬁciently many
samples that can be time-consuming, and its (statistical) approximation error is generally difﬁcult
to analyse. Thus, the MC method is not applicable for practical policy evaluation of distributional
LQR, and in this experiment, it is used only to verify our approximate return distribution. In com-
parison, the approximate return distribution using ﬁnite number of random variables in this paper
is analytical for policy evaluation and the corresponding approximation error can be bounded: as
such, it is further usable for policy optimisation, as shown in Section 4. We denote here by fNthe
distribution of the approximated random return GK
N(x0)obtained considering Nrandom variables.
We ﬁx the feedback gain as K= 0:4684 and select different values of andx0. The results
are shown in Fig. 1. Speciﬁcally, Fig. 1 (a) and (c) show that when is small, the return distribution
can be well approximated using only few random variables ( N= 3works well). However, when 
approaches 1, more random variables are needed for an accurate approximation: we employ N= 15
andN= 20 random variables in the case of = 0:8and= 0:85, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1
(b) and (d). Moreover, the value of the initial state x0has an inﬂuence on the shape of the return
distribution, which can be clearly observed from the scalar case. When x0is large, the random
variablewT
kPAk+1
Kx0dominates and, therefore, its distribution is close to a Gaussian distribution,
as shown in Fig. 1 (c) and (d). If instead x0is small, then the random variable wT
kPwkplays a
leading role, so the overall distribution is close to the chi-square one, as shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b).
In conclusion, when Nis large, the approximate distribution is closer to the distribution obtained
from the MC method, and thus to the true distribution.

4. Application to Risk-Averse LQR
In this section, we consider a risk-averse LQR problem and leverage the closed-form expression
of the random return GK(x)to obtain an optimal policy. Since the distribution of the random
returnGK(x)consists of an inﬁnite number of random variables, it is computationally unwieldy.
Instead, we employ the approximate random return GK
N(x)proposed in Section 3.2. As a risk
measure for the problem at hand, we select the well-known Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
(Rockafellar et al., 2000). We then construct an approximate risk-averse objective function, as
^CN(K) := CVaR 
GK
N(x)
. For a random variable Zwith the CDF Fand a risk level 2(0;1],
theCVaR value is deﬁned as CVaR[Z] =EF[ZjZ >Z], whereZis the 1 quantile of the
distribution of the random variable Z. Given this objective function, the goal is to ﬁnd the optimal
risk-averse controller, that is, to select the feedback gain Kthat minimises ^CN(K).
4.1. Risk-Averse Policy Gradient Algorithm
In what follows, we propose a policy gradient method to solve this problem. We assume that the
matricesA;B;Q;R are known. The ﬁrst-order gradient descent step is hard to compute as it hinges
on the gradient of the CVaR function. Therefore, we rely on zeroth-order optimisation to derive the
policy gradient, as detailed in Algorithm 1.
Speciﬁcally, at each episode t, we sample an approximate feedback gain ^Kt=Kt+Ut, where
Utis drawn uniformly at random from the set of matrices with norm . Given ^Kt, we compute the
approximate distribution of the random return G^Kt
N(x)in (9) and the value of ^CN(^Kt). Then, we
can perform the feedback gain update as Kt+1=Kt gt, wheregt=n

Here, the zeroth-order residual feedback technique proposed in Zhang et al. (2022) is used to reduce
the variance. The theoretical analysis of this algorithm is left as our future work.
4.2. Numerical Experiments
Next, we consider a risk-averse LQR problem and experimentally illustrate the performance of
Algorithm 1. We illustrate our approach for the same scalar system with the same cost function
as in Section 3.3. The other parameters are selected as = 0:6,= 0:1,= 0:0004 ,N= 10 ,
respectively. The initial controller is set as K0= 0:2, which is a stable one.
We ﬁrst set = 1: in this case, the risk-averse control problem is reduced to a risk-neutral
control problem. Therefore, we can use traditional LQR techniques to compute the optimal feed-
back gainK= 0:4684 . We run the proposed risk-averse policy gradient Algorithm 1 and the
simulation results are presented in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). Speciﬁcally, in Fig. 2 (a), the controller K
returned by Algorithm 1 converges to K, which veriﬁes our proposed method for the risk-neutral
case. Fig. 2 (b) illustrates the values of CVaR achieved by Algorithm 1. Additionally, we select
= 0:4to ﬁnd the optimal risk-averse controller. The simulation results are presented in Fig. 2
(c) and (d). We see that Kconverges to 0:55, which leads to a smaller A+BK compared to
K= 0:4684 .
5. Conclusions
We have proposed a new distributional approach to the classic discounted LQR problem. Speciﬁ-
cally, we ﬁrst provided an analytic expression for the exact random return that depends on inﬁnitely
many random variables. Since the computation of this expression is difﬁcult in practice, we also
proposed an approximate expression for the distribution of the random return that only depends on
a ﬁnite number of random variables, and have further characterised the error between these two
distributions. Finally, we utilised the proposed random return to obtain an optimal controller for a
risk-averse LQR problem using the CVaR as a measure of risk. To the best of our knowledge, this
is a ﬁrst framework for distributional LQR: it inherits the advantages of DRL methods compared
to standard RL methods that rely on the expected return to evaluate the effect of a given policy,
but it also provides an analytic expression for the return distribution, an area where current DRL
methods signiﬁcantly lack. Future research includes analyzing the theoretical convergence of risk-
averse policy gradient algorithms and exploring a model-free setup where the system matrices are
unknown.
