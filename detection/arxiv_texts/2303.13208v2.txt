Abstract
Kantor pairs, (quadratic) Jordan pairs, and similar struct ures have been instrumental in the
study of Z-graded Lie algebras and algebraic groups. We introduce the notion of an operator
Kantorpair, ageneralization of Kantorpairs toarbitrary ( commutative, unital)rings, similar in
spirit as to howquadratic Jordan pairs and algebras general ize linear Jordan pairs andalgebras.
Such an operator Kantor pair is formed by a pair of Φ-groups ( G+,G−) of a speciﬁc kind,
equipped with certain homogeneous operators. For each such a pair (G+,G−), we construct
a 5-graded Lie algebra Ltogether with actions of G±onLas automorphisms. Moreover, we
can associate a group G(G+,G−)⊂Aut(L) to this pair generalizing the projective elementary
group of Jordan pairs. If the non-0-graded part of Lis projective, we can uniquely recover
G+,G−fromG(G+,G−) and the grading on Lalone. We establish, over rings Φ with 1 /30∈Φ,
a one to one correspondence between Kantor pairs and operato r Kantor pairs. Finally, we
constructoperator Kantorpairs for the diﬀerentfamilies o fcentral simple structurablealgebras.

Introduction
Structurable algebras were introduced over ﬁelds of characteris tic diﬀerent from 2 and 3 and classi-
ﬁed over ﬁelds of characteristic 0 by Bruce Allison [1]. Oleg Smirnov [26 ] generalized the classiﬁca-
tion ofthese algebrasto ﬁelds with characteristicdiﬀerent from 2, 3 and 5. Morerecently, Anastasia
Stavrova [27] classiﬁed the structurable algebras over ﬁelds of ch aracteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3
in a diﬀerent fashion. These algebras are useful in the study of 5-g raded Lie algebras and algebraic

1groups [14, 17, 9, 11], which is the point of view we shall take through out this paper. Furthermore,
the deﬁnition of structurable algebras can be extended to arbitra ry rings [5, Section 5], but not
necessarily in a manner suitable for the study of 5-graded Lie algebr as. However, a good deﬁnition
for structurable algebras over arbitrary rings, which allows for a g eneralization of the links with
(algebraic) groups, was still lacking.
We will not only focus on structurable algebras, but also on Kantor p airs and Kantor triple
systems, as introduced —under the name “generalized Jordan trip le systems of second order”—
by Isaiah Kantor [16]. Kantor pairs are useful for the study of 5-g raded Lie algebras and related
groups as well [6, 7]. Just like for structurable algebras, there is no good theory yet for Kantor pairs
over arbitrary rings. Since each structurable algebra induces a Ka ntor pair with the same 5-graded
Lie algebra, we will focus on generalizing Kantor pairs to “operator K antor pairs” as a means to
generalize both.
We introduce the notion of an operator Kantor pair. The operator Kantor pairs relate to
Kantor pairs, like quadratic Jordan pairs [18, 19] relate to linear Jor dan pairs (“verbundene Paare”
in [21]). To be speciﬁc, instead of the 3-linear map ( a,b,c)/ma√sto→Va,bcassociated to a Kantor pair, we
will considercertain operators Qgrp,TandPwhich canbe constructed from Voverrings with11/6.
We construct, for each operator Kantor pair ( G+,G−), an associated 5-graded Lie algebra. If
1/2∈Φ, then this 5-graded Lie algebra can, alternatively, be construct ed from a genuine Kantor
pair. We also construct a group G(G+,G−) generalizing the projective elementary group. We show
that the group G(G+,G−) has the properties which are desired for the projective elementa ry group
ifG+andG−areprojectivemodules. Namely,weprovethatitisnotonlyagroupo fautomorphisms
ofaLiealgebra,butthatthegroups G+andG−correspondexactlytothe“positive”and“negative”
part ofG(G+,G−).
For rings with 1 /30∈Φ, we show that each Kantor pair induces an operator Kantor pair.
Moreover, we prove that all classes of central simple structurab le algebras induce operator Kantor
pairs. More precisely:
1. We show that each quadratic Jordan algebra becomes an operat or Kantor pair with operators
Qgrp=Q, T= 0,andPxy=QxQyx, by establishing the link between the operators and
parts of quasi-inverses.
2. Similarly, we show that a Kantor pair associated to a hermitian form , as studied by John
Faulkner and Bruce Allison [6], induces an operator Kantor pair over a rbitrary rings using
an appropriate generalization of quasi-inverses. In particular, ea ch associative algebra with
involution induces an operator Kantor pair.
3. For each structurable algebra associated to a hermitian form [1 , 8.iii], we also construct an
operator Kantor pair, by making use of a Peirce context in the sens e of [6] for this class of
algebras.
4. For the other classes, i.e.,
(a) forms of the tensor products of composition algebras,
(b) forms of matrix structurable algebras, described in terms of h ermitian cubic norm struc-
tures [12],
1We will often talk about “a ring Φ with 1 /n” or write “1 /n∈Φ” when we mean that we require nto be invertible
in the ring Φ.
2(c) Smirnov algebras (if 1 /2∈Φ),
we also prove that these induce operator Kantor pairs using certa in algebras deﬁned over Z.
However, for the tensor product of composition algebras and Smir nov algebras, we will not
consider arbitrary forms.
Outline. In Section1, weintroducevectorgroups. ThesegroupsareΦ-gr oupfunctors Gequipped
with a subgroup functor G2, together with some sort of scalar multiplications. These vector gr oups
can be identiﬁed with Φ-groups that can be represented as formal power series 1+ tg1+t2g2+···.
For each vector group, we construct a universal representatio n, which is a representation in a Hopf
algebraH, in terms of such formal power series. We also deﬁne homogeneous maps on such groups
and develop a method that will allow us to derive necessary equalities in volving homogeneous maps
using this universal representation.
InSection 2, weintroducesomenotationtoworkwith apairofvecto rgrouprepresentations,for-
mulateTheorem2.9whichweproveintheappendix,andlistamultitudeo fequationsinLemma2.12
that hold for pairs of vector group representations. Theorem 2.9 and Lemma 2.12 are technical
results that will be very useful when proving that certain pairs of v ector group representations
correspond to operator Kantor pairs.
InSection3, weintroduceoperatorKantorpairsandprovethe af orementionedresultsongeneral
operator Kantor pairs. Namely, we ﬁrst introduce pre-Kantor pa irs (G+,G−), which are pairs of
vector groups with homogeneous operators. For such a pair, we in troduce a Lie algebra L, and
we construct vector group representations to the endomorphis m algebra of Lby making use of the
operators. Secondly, we deﬁne operator Kantor pairs , which are pre-Kantor pairs satisfying some
additional equations on those operators. We prove that, for ope rator Kantor pairs, the constructed
vector group representations induce maps G±−→Aut(L). Finally, in Theorem 3.26, we prove that
the groupG≤Aut(L) generated by G+andG−is similar to the projective elementary group of
quadratic Jordan pairs if G+andG−are projective.
InSection 4, we provethat there existsapreciselinkbetween Kant orpairs, pre-Kantorpairsand
operator Kantor pairs. Namely, we show that these three classes are in a one to one correspondence
if 1/30∈Φ. Finally, in Section 5, we use the diﬀerent classes of central simple s tructurable algebras
to deﬁne operator Kantor pairs. At the end of that section, we pr opose a deﬁnition of structurable
algebras in our setting.
Throughoutthepaper,Φdenotesthebaseringoverwhichwework . Unlessstatedotherwise,Φis
an arbitrary commutative unital ring. The category Φ -algis the category of associative, unital,
commutative Φ-algebras. All Φ-modules are assumed to be left modu les unless stated explicitly
otherwise (which will occur only in paragraph 5.3).
1 Vector groups
Inthis section, weintroducevectorgroups. Thesecanbe though tofasgroupsendowedwithascalar
multiplication over Φ, similar to modules. In order to make their likeness precise, we also need the
Φ-group functor (i.e., a functor2Φ-alg−→Grp) mappingK/ma√sto→M⊗ΦKfor modules M. Namely,
2Such a group valued functor can also be described as a set valu ed functor endowed with certain natural trans-
formations corresponding to the group operation, the unit, and taking inverses. A more precise formulation of this
can be found in [29, Section 1.4].
3this functor can be endowed with a scalar multiplication K×M(K)−→M(K) which is natural in
K. Vector groups are groups Gwith a similar construction plan for a functor K/ma√sto→G(K) for which
there exists a natural transformation K×G(K)−→G(K) coming from the scalar multiplication.
In the ﬁrst subsection, we introduce vector groups and constru ct functors from them. We also
delineate the class of proper vector groups, which are the only one s we work with in the rest of
the article. We prove that the Lie algebra of a proper vector group is preserved under scalar
extensions. In the second subsection, we introduce homogeneou s maps on proper vector groups and
representations of proper vector groups, and introduce the co rresponding universal objects. In the
last subsection, we determine the primitive elements of the universa l representation for projective
vector groups and recover each projective vector group from it s universal representation.
1.1 Deﬁnition and basic properties
Consider Φ-modules AandBand a bilinear form
ψ:A×A−→B.
We endowA×Bwith a group structure
(a,b)(c,d) = (a+c,b+d+ψ(a,c)),
a ﬁrst type of scalar multiplication
λ·1(a,b) = (λa,λ2b),
and a second one
λ·2(0,b) = (0,λb),
where the second scalar multiplication is only deﬁned on the subgroup 0×B. Sinceψis a bilinear
form, we see that λ·1is an endomorphism of A×B.
Deﬁnition 1.1. Consider a subgroup GofA×B. We callGanalmost vector group if the following
two conditions hold.
1.Gis closed under g/ma√sto→λ·1gfor allλ∈Φ;
2.G2=G∩0×Bis closed under g/ma√sto→λ·2gfor allλ∈Φ.
LetˆG(K) be the smallest subgroup of ( A×B)⊗Kcontaining all g⊗1 forg∈Gand closed under
both (g/ma√sto→λ·ig) for allλ∈K. If now, in addition,
3. (G2⊗ΦK)−→ˆG(K)2is a surjection3for all Φ-algebras Kwhenever 1 /2/∈Φ,
holds, then we call Gavector group . In particular, if 1 /2∈Φ, then by deﬁnition, each almost
vector group is a vector group.
Remark 1.2. An example where the third condition is not satisﬁed, is the group G⊂Z/4Z×Z/2Z
overZ/4Zwithψ(1,1) = 1, formed by the elements (0 ,0) and (2,1). Namely, if we set K=Z/2Z
we getˆG(K) ={(0,0),(0,1)}, so that indeed ˆG(K)2is bigger than G2⊗K.
If 1/2∈Φ, one can show that the condition stated in item 3 is automatically sat isﬁed.
3The tensor product is a tensor product of modules.
4Lemma 1.3. LetGbe an almost vector group. The group ˆG(K)is generated as a subgroup of
(A×B)⊗Kby the sets of generators K·1(g⊗1)forg∈GandK·2(G2⊗1).
Proof.By deﬁnition, both K·1(g⊗1) forg∈GandK·2(G2⊗1) should be contained in ˆG(K).
So, we need to prove that the group generated by those sets is clo sed under scalar multiplications.
This is the case since scalar multiplications are endomorphisms of ˆG(K) such that
λ·i(µ·ig) = (λµ·ig),
fori= 1,2 and
λi·i(λj·jg) =λj
iλi
j·2g,
fori,jsuch that {i,j}={1,2}.
From the previous lemma, we can conclude immediately that K/ma√sto−→ˆG(K) is a functor
Φ-alg−→Grp
and thus a Φ-group. Consider the ring of dual numbers Φ[ǫ], i.e., the ring obtained by adding a
generatorǫsatisfyingǫ2= 0, and consider the projection π: Φ[ǫ]−→Φ. We use Lie( G) to denote
the Lie algebra associated to G:
Lie(G) = kerˆG(π) ={(ǫa,ǫb)∈ˆG(Φ[ǫ])}
with as bracket the restriction of the commutator on A×B, or equivalently
[(a,b),(c,d)] = (0,ψ(a,c)−ψ(c,a)).
This is the Lie algebra one typically associates to a linear algebraic grou p, cfr. [22, the deﬁnition
preceding Example 3.1] (even though the Lie bracket is typically intro duced in a diﬀerent fashion).
Now, we prove that each almost vector group can be seen as a quot ient of an actual vector
group.
Lemma 1.4. Suppose that G≤A×Bis an almost vector group and that there exists (a,ba)∈Gfor
eacha∈A. ThenGis a vector group. Moreover, using the projection πA:G−→A, each almost
vector group G≤A×Bcan be lifted to a vector group G′≤πA(G)×Bsuch that ˆG′(K)−→ˆG(K)
is an isomorphism for all ﬂat K.
Proof.We ﬁrst remark that q:a/ma√sto→ba∈B/G2is a quadratic map with linearisation q(x,y) =
ψ(x,y). So, if we look at ˆG(K) we have elements ( a,ba)∈(A×B)⊗Kand we note that qK(a) =ba
mod (G2⊗K) since it holds for all generators of ˆG(K) (where we use ( G2⊗K) to denote its image
inB⊗K). Therefore, we see that (0 ,b)∈ˆG(K)2means that b= 0 mod (G2⊗K), which is exactly
what we had to prove.
For the moreover part, we observe that πA(G) is a submodule of Asince it is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication. For ﬂat Kwe note that
πA(G)⊗K−→A⊗K
is an embedding.
5In what follows, will just write
(λg1,λ2g2) =λ·1(g1,g2),
etc., for elements of ˆG(K) instead of using tensor products.
Lemma 1.5. LetGbe an almost vector group. If (g1,g2)is an element of G, then also sg=
(0,2g2−ψ(g1,g1))is an element of G. Furthermore, for K∈Φ-alg,λ,µ∈Kandg∈ˆG(K), we
have
(λ+µ)·1g= (λ·1g)(µ·1g)(λµ·2sg).
Proof.We compute for g= (g1,g2)∈ˆG(K) that
ˆG∋g(−1·1g) = (0,2g2−ψ(g1,g1)) =sg.
For the second claim, we compute
(λ·1g)(µ·1g)(λµ·2sg) = (λg1,λ2g2)(µg1,µ2g2)(0,2λµg2−λµψ(g1,g1))
= ((λ+µ)g1,(λ2+µ2)g2+λµψ(g1,g1))(0,2λµg2−λµψ(g1,g1))
= ((λ+µ)g1,(λ2+µ2+2λµ)g2)
= (λ+µ)·1(g1,g2).
Remark 1.6. We will often write −gfor (−1)·1g. In particular, the element sgof the previous
lemma becomes g(−g).
Lemma 1.7. LetGbe a vector group. The underlying Φ-module of Lie(G)is isomorphic to
L=G/G2⊕G2,
which we can identify with a submodule of A×Busing(a,b)G2/ma√sto→(a,0).
Proof.We note that G/G2⊂Ais an actual module since it is closed under the group operation,
and thus addition, and since it is closed under ·1, and thus scalar multiplication.
We provethat ˆG(Φ[ǫ]) is a semi-direct product G⋉(ǫL). This immediately provesthat Lie( G)∼=
L. First, note that
ǫL⊂ˆG(Φ[ǫ]),
since
ǫL= (ǫ·1G)+(ǫ·2G2).
We see that ǫLis an abelian subgroup. Second, one can compute that ǫLis stabilized by Gunder
the conjugation action. By applying Lemma 1.5 on ( a+bǫ)·1gwe obtain that Φ[ ǫ]·G≤G⋉ǫL.
Since (a+bǫ)·1is an endomorphism, we see that G⋉(ǫL) is closed under scalar multiplications.
Lemma 1.8. LetρK:ˆG(K)−→ˆH(K)be a natural transformation between Φ-group functors
associated to vector groups such that
ρK(λ·ig) =λ·iρK(g)
for allg∈ˆG(K),λ∈K. The groups L= kerρΦandI= ImρΦare almost vector groups with
ˆI(K) = ImρK. Hence, both are always vector groups if 1/2∈Φ. Moreover, Iis a vector group if
and only ifρ(G2(K)) =I2(K)andLis a vector group if and only if L2⊗K−→ˆL2(K)is surjective.
6Proof.It is trivial to see that LandIare closed under both scalar multiplications and thus almost
vector groups. So, we conclude that LandIis a vector group if 1 /2∈Φ. Using the additional
assumptions we immediately see that IandLare vector groups as well if 1 /2/∈Φ.
Deﬁnition 1.9. We call a natural transformation ρ:ˆG−→ˆHbetween the Φ -grpfunctors
associated to vector groups G,H, avector group homomorphism if
ρ(λ·ig) =λ·iρ(g),
andρ−1
K(ˆH2(K))⊆ˆG2(K)kerρKfor all Φ-algebras K. If 1/2/∈Φ we also ask that ker ρΦis a vector
group. We use VecGrp to denote the category of vector groups over Φ with these morph isms. If
there is any doubt about the base ring, we write Φ -VecGrp .
Remark 1.10. All the conditions, except ρ−1
K(ˆH2(K))⊆ˆG2(K)kerρK, are justiﬁed by the fact
that kerρmust be a vector group as well. This other condition translates into ρ−1(H2)⊂G2
for injective maps, i.e., injective morphisms preserve the second co mponent. The more general
condition is obtained by requiring that this holds and that G−→Hfactors through some kind of
vector group L=G/kerρwithL2obtained by projecting G2. Moreover, this condition guarantees
that the image is a vector group if 1 /2/∈Φ.
The condition on ker ρΦif 1/2/∈Φ can be thought of as asking that the lift Lof kerΦ deﬁned
in Lemma 1.4 has a homomorphism ˆL−→ˆGwith image /hatwiderkerρΦ.
At this moment, we should be careful if we write G/Kfor normal K≤G, since we did not
prove thatG/Kis a vector group for each normal vector subgroup Kin general. However, we can
alwaysconsiderit asa Φ-groupwith well-deﬁned scalarendomorphism sand awell-deﬁned subgroup
(G/K)2. Later, we will see that G/Kis always a vector group whenever Gis proper (what it means
to be proper is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1.16) in Corollary 1.35.
Lemma 1.11. LetL1⊕L2be aZ-graded Lie algebra over a ring Φwith1/2∈Φ. ThenL1⊕L2
forms a vector group with operation
(a,b)(c,d) = (a+c,b+d+[a,c]/2).
Moreover, each vector group GoverΦis isomorphic (as a group) to the vector group Lassociated
toLie(G)by mapping
(a,b)/ma√sto−→(a,b−ψ(a,a)/2).
This mapping induces a Φ-group epimorphism ˆL(K)−→ˆG(K). Hence, the third axiom for vector
groups will also hold if 1/2∈Φ.
Proof.Note thatG=L1⊕L2so that all axioms for vector groups are trivially satisﬁed.
Now, we prove that each vector group can be reparametrized in th is fashion. Lemma 1.5 proves
that 2b−ψ(a,a)∈G2⊂Lie(G). So, we conclude that ( a,b−ψ(a,a)/2)∈Lie(G).To observe
the surjectivity of this map, take arbitrary ( a,b)∈Gand note that the coset ( a,b)G2maps to all
(a,s)∈Lie(G). On the other hand, the reparametrization is obviously injective.
A direct computation shows that this reparametrization is a group h omomorphism if one uses
thatψ(a,c)−ψ(c,a) = [a,c]. Moreover, the scalar multiplications and G2are preserved, so that
we have a vector group isomorphism. We note L⊗K−→ˆG(K) : (a,b)/ma√sto→(a,ψ(a,a)/2 +b) is
surjective.
7Remark 1.12. The fact that the operation in the previous lemma is given by
(a,b)(c,d) = (a+c,b+d+[a,c]/2)
shows that vector groups, if 1 /2∈Φ, correspond directly to groups of exponentials. Speciﬁcally, if
we consider the Lie algebra
L= Φζ⊕L1⊕L2,
with [ζ,li] =iliforli∈Liand [Li,Lj]⊂Li+jwithLk= 0 ifk>2, then the group
exp(L1⊕L2)≤Aut(L)
has the aforementioned operation.
LetGbe a vector group over Φ, then ˆG(K) is a vector group over K. We write L/ma√sto−→ˆGK(L)
to denote the K-Grpfunctor associated to the vector group ˆG(K).
Lemma 1.13. LetGbe a vector group and K∈Φ-alg, then there exists a surjective homomorphism
Lie(G)⊗K−→Lie(ˆGK).
Proof.First, recall the surjection G2⊗K−→ˆG2(K) which is assumed in the deﬁnition of a vector
group if 1/2/∈Φ. We can also obtain such a surjection from Lemma 1.11 if 1 /2∈Φ. Secondly, the
possible ﬁrst coordinates of elements of GKareK-linear combinations of possible ﬁrst coordinates
ofG. We conclude that Lie( GK) is a homomorphic image of Lie( G)⊗Kby Lemma 1.7.
Deﬁnition 1.14. We call a vector group Gfree (resp. projective) ifG2andG/G2are free (resp.
projective) as Φ-modules. Similarly, we say that Gisﬁnitely generated ifG/G2andG2are ﬁnitely
generated as Φ-modules.
Note that there exist non-canonical bijections between Gand Lie(G), since (a,b),(a,c) being
elements of Gimplies that ( a,b)(−a,c) = (0,b+c−ψ(a,a))∈G2so that for each possible ﬁrst
coordinate aofG, the possible second coordinates stand in bijection with ψ(a,a)−b+G2∼=G2.
So, Lemma 1.13 shows that ˆGcan be identiﬁed with (a quotient of the) Set-functor deﬁned by
K/ma√sto−→Lie(G)⊗K
IfG/G2is projective, then this quotient is given by a natural transformat ion. Namely, since
this module is projective, we have a generating set ( ai)i∈IofG/G2and dual generating set ( αi)i∈I
such that
v=/summationdisplay
i∈Iαi(v)ai,
with ﬁnite αi(v)/ne}ationslash= 0. By using a total order on Iand taking ( ai,bi)∈Gfor eachi, we obtain a
natural transformation
Lie(G)⊗K/ma√sto−→ˆG(K) : (v,s)/ma√sto−→
v,s+/summationdisplay
i∈Iαi(v)2bi+/summationdisplay
i<jαi(v)αj(v)ψ(ai,aj)
∈ˆG(K).
IfGis ﬁnitely generated projective, then we know that K/ma√sto→Lie(G)⊗Kis an aﬃne algebraic
scheme. Speciﬁcally, set V= Lie(G) then we know that K/ma√sto→V⊗Kis an aﬃne algebraic scheme
8underlying G/ma√sto→ˆG(K). Later, in Lemma 1.19, we shall also see that this is an aﬃne algebraic group
scheme. To see that this is really aﬃne and algebraic, use the module V∗which is ﬁnitely generated
and projective [10, Chapter 2.6], to consider the algebra Sym( V∗) which is ﬁnitely generated as an
algebra. Using that
HomΦ−alg(Sym(V∗),K)∼=HomΦ(V∗,K)∼=V⊗K,
forﬁnitelygeneratedprojectivemodules V[10, Chapter2.7,Corollary4], weobtainthat K/ma√sto→V⊗K
is an aﬃne algebraic scheme.
Lemma 1.15. LetS1andS2be sets. There exists a free vector group F(S1,S2)such that for every
vector group Gand each pair of maps f:S1−→Gandg:S2−→G2, there exists a unique Φ-group
homomorphism ρ:ˆF(S1,S2)−→ˆG. Moreover, this is a vector group homomorphism if and only if
the almost vector group (kerρΦ)⊂F(S1,S2)is a vector group and ρ−1
Φ(G2) = (kerρΦ)F(S1,S2)2.
Proof.First, ﬁx a total order of S1. Second, we deﬁne T2=S2∪{[a,b]∈S1×S1|a<b}∪{s(t)|t∈
S1},where we wrote [ a,b]∈S1×S1as they will be used to represent commutators, and use the
symbols(t) to represent t(−t) fort∈S1. Fix a total order of T2as well. We will endow the functor
K−→ˆF(S1,S2)(K) =/braceleftigg/productdisplay
s∈S1ks·s/productdisplay
t∈T2lt·t|only ﬁnitely many nonzero ks,lt∈K/bracerightigg
where the product is a symbolic product respecting the ordering of S1andT2, with a vector group
structure, and we wrote products as this will represent a produc t of group elements.
If we can do that, we have a Φ-group homomorphisms ˆF(S1,S2)−→ˆGfor any pair of maps f
andgdescribed in the lemma. Note that this vector group, if it is a vector g roup, is free in the
usual sense of Deﬁnition 1.14, since the Lie algebra is freely generat ed byS1andT2.
We will deﬁne ˆF(S1,S2)(K) as a vector group contained in the free K-moduleF1×F2withF1
free overS1andF2free overU2=S2∪(S1×S1)∪t(S1) (where we write ( s1,s2)∈S1×S2as usual
for products of sets), endowed with the group operation
(s,t)(s′,t′) = (s+s′,t+t′+(s,s′)),
where (s,s′) is the bilinear form deﬁned from extending the identity map
S1×S1−→S1×S1−→F(S1×S1)
bilinearly. In this module, we use 2 t(l)−(l,l) to represent the element s(l)∈T2forl∈S1, use
(a,b)−(b,a) to represent [ a,b]∈T2, and generators s∈S2are represented by themselves.
The map which sends each element gto its inverse g−1deﬁned onF1×F2can be projected to
onlyact onthe secondcomponent F2; we obtainamap iwhich actsas l/ma√sto→ −l,(a,b)/ma√sto→(b,a),t(k)/ma√sto→
−t(k)+(k,k) fora,b,k∈S1,l∈S2. The submodule containing all xinF2such thatx+i(x) = 0 is
precisely the free module generated by T2, using the identiﬁcations made between generators. We
also remark that the free module generated by T2is a direct summand of F2, since we can extend
T2with the set {(a,b)∈S1×S1|a>b}∪{t(a)|a∈S1}to obtain a freely generating set of F2. We
deﬁne
ˆF(S1,S2)(K) ={(a,b)∈(F1×F2)⊗K|b+i(b) = (a,a)}.
9Note that for each s∈S1the element ( ks1,k2t(s1)) lies in ˆF(S1,S2)(K) fork∈K, so that the
underlying set functor K/ma√sto→ˆF(S1,S2)(K) coincides with the earlier deﬁnition of F. Using the fact
that [a,b] = (a,b)−(b,a) ands(a) = 2t(a)−(a,a), we see that the elements [ a,b],s(a) ofFcoincide
with what they should be.
Consider a vector group G≤A×B. Givenf:S1−→Gandg:S2−→G2, we can deﬁne
ρ:F1×F2−→A×B. First write f:S1−→A×B:s/ma√sto→(f1(s),f2(s)). There exists a unique map
˜f1:F1−→Aextendingf1. There also exists a unique map F2−→Bextendingg:S2−→G2,
f2:S1−→B, andψ◦(f1×f1) :S1×S1−→B. This induces a homomorphism ˆF(S1,S2)−→ˆG.
Since both kernel and image are closed under scalar multiplications, t he moreover statement
follows as well.
Deﬁnition 1.16. We call a vector group Gproperif there exist generating sets S1andS2ofG
such thatρ:ˆF(S1,S2)−→ˆGconstructed in Lemma 1.15 is a vector group homomorphism. This
is the case if and only if the almost vector group L= kerρΦis a vector group.
So, we remark that all vector groups over rings containing 1 /2 are proper.
So, for a proper vector group, we can introduce a new functor K/ma√sto→G(K) by making use of the
previous lemma. Namely, we can construct a free vector group F(S1,S2) fromGusing elements
S1⊆GandS2⊆G2that generate the Lie algebra Lie( G) and note that there exists a vector group
L= kerρΦassociated to the kernel ρ:F(S1,S2)−→G. We deﬁne G(K) =/hatwiderF(S1,S2)(K)/ˆL(K).
In Lemma 1.18 we check that the deﬁntion of K/ma√sto→G(K) does not depend on the generating sets
S1andS2.
We remark that G(K)∼=ˆH(K) for the image HofF(S1,S2) in (F1/L1)×(F2/L2) using the
F1,F2we introduced in Lemma 1.15, while L1×L2= kerF1×F2−→A×B. We remark that H
is obviously an almost vector group and thus a vector group by Lemm a 1.4.
We useGKto denote the functor L/ma√sto→G(K⊗KL) forK-algebrasL.
Lemma 1.17. LetGbe a proper vector group, then Lie(GK)∼=Lie(G)⊗K. On the other hand,
G(K)∼=ˆG(K)whenever Lie(ˆG(K))∼=Lie(G)⊗K. Furthermore, Lie(GK)∼=Lie(G)⊗Kis a
suﬃcient condition to be proper.
Proof.We use the notation introduced before this lemma. Take g= (ǫf1,ǫf2)ˆL(K)∈G(K)
and note that g= 0 if and only if f1lies in the image of Lie( L)⊗Kandf2lies in the image
of Lie(L)⊗K. From the right exactness of the tensor product, we derive an ex act sequence
Lie(L)⊗K−→Lie(F(S1,S2))⊗K−→Lie(G)⊗K−→0, which shows Lie( G)⊗K∼=Lie(GK).
Now, suppose that the Lie algebra of ˆG(K) coincides with Lie( G)⊗K. We remark that we
have a natural transformation G(K)−→ˆG(K) by construction. The kernel of this map is always
contained in G2(K) sinceG(K)/G2(K) andˆG(K)/ˆG2(K) can be identiﬁed as parts of the Lie
algebra. On the other hand, G2(K) andˆG2(K) are also identiﬁed as parts of this Lie algebra.
Lastly, for the suﬃcient condition, we note that Lie( GK)∼=Lie(G)⊗Kis suﬃcient for the
kernel kerρΦto be a vector group by the right exactness of the tensor produc t.
Now, we do a little sanity check to see that we can vary the generatin g set employed in Lemma
1.15 without changing the functor K/ma√sto→G(K).
Lemma 1.18. The construction of K/ma√sto→G(K)for a vector group does not depend on the generating
setsS1andS2employed in Lemma 1.15.
10Proof.Suppose that Gis proper for a pair of generating sets S1andS2and consider the functor
G=ˆHconstructed from it. Now, any pair of generating sets U1andU2induce a homomorphism
θ:ˆF(U1,U2)−→ˆHby using that ˆH(Φ) =G. We conclude that ker θΦis a vector group by Lemma
1.17. Hence, ρ:ˆF(U1,U2)−→ˆGis a vector group homomorphism as well.
Lemma 1.19. IfGis a projective vector group, then Gis proper. The functor K/ma√sto→G(K)is an
aﬃne algebraic group for ﬁnitely generated projective GwithG(K)∼=Lie(G)⊗Kas set valued
functors.
Proof.SinceG1=G/G2is projective and since the F1constructed in Lemma 1.15 is free, the
epimorphism ρ:F1−→G1shows that ker ρ|F1=K1a direct summand of F1. Now we see that
/hatwiderkerρΦ(K)≤(K1×F2)⊗K⊆(F1×F2)⊗Kso that ker ρis a vector group by Lemma 1.4.
We note that K/ma√sto→ˆF(S1,S2)(K), withˆF(S1,S2) as in Lemma 1.15, has coordinate algebra
A= Φ[S1,T2] withS1a ﬁnite generating set of G1andT2a ﬁnite set deﬁned in Lemma 1.15 from
S1and a ﬁnite generating set S2ofG2. We remark that ˆHhas coordinate algebra O(Lie(G)).
Applying the projection operator A−→ O(Lie(G)), yields a quotient of aﬃne algebraic groups
withK/ma√sto→ˆH(K) as corresponding functor of points.
For the rest of this article, we are interested in proper vector gro ups and the associated functor
K/ma√sto→G(K) and not so much in the functor K/ma√sto→ˆG(K).
1.2 Representations and homogeneous maps
In this section, we assume that all vector groups under considera tion are proper.
Deﬁnition 1.20. LetMbe a module and Ga vector group. Identify Mwith the functor
Φ-alg−→Set:K/ma√sto−→M⊗K.
Similarly, identify GwithG−→G(K).We shall deﬁne homogeneous maps of degree nusing
recursion on the degree. We call a natural transformation f:G−→Mahomogeneous map of
degreenif there exist linearisations
f(i,j):G×G−→M,
for alli,j∈N>0withi+j=n, which are homogeneous of degree iin the ﬁrst component,
homogeneous of degree jin the second component, such that
fK((λ·ag)(µ·bh)) =fK(λ·ag)+fK(µ·bh)+/summationdisplay
ai+bj=nλiµjf(ai,bj)
K(g,h),
for allλ,µ∈K, in which we ask that
fK(λ·1g) =λnfK(g),
and
fK(λ·2g) =/braceleftigg
0 nis odd
λ(n/2)fK(g) otherwise.
Remark that homogeneous maps of degree 0 are constant maps4, and homogeneous maps of degree
1 are maps that factor as linear maps through G/G2.
4To prove this, use that 00means 0 multiplied by itself 0 times, i.e., 1, in this context .
11Deﬁnition 1.21. LetCbe an associative unital algebra and ta variable over which we consider
formal power series. We identify (1+ tC[[t]]) with the Φ -Grpfunctor
K/ma√sto→1+t(C⊗K)[[t]].
Consider a sequence ( ρi:G−→C)iof natural transformations. Assume that these deﬁne a natura l
transformation of Φ-groups ρ[t]:G−→(1+tC[[t]]) using
ρ[t](g) =/summationdisplay
ρi(g)ti.
Note that this satisﬁes, as it is a natural transformation of Φ-gro ups, the equation
ρ[t](gh) =ρ[t](g)ρ[t](h)
for allg,h∈G(K). We call ( ρi:G−→C)iavector group representation if
1.ρ[t](λ·1g) =ρ[λt](g), i.e., the ﬁrst scalar multiplication corresponds to substituting λtfortin
the formal power series,
2.ρ[t](G2)≤(1+t2C[[t2]]), so that we can take
σ[t]:G2−→(1+tC[[t]])
such thatσ[t2]=ρ[t],
3.σ[t](λ·2g) =σ[λt](g),
4.ρ[t](g)∈(1+t2C[[t2]]) means that
g∈(kerρ)·G2,
i.e., there exists h∈G2such thatgh∈kerρ.
Lemma 1.22. Suppose that (ρi:G−→C)iis a vector group representation, then each ρiis a
homogeneous map of degree i.
Proof.This is obviously the case for i= 0,1. The rest follows easily by induction using that
ρ(i,j)
n(g,h) =ρi(g)ρj(h).
Lemma 1.23. LetGbe a vector group, and Ma module. Suppose that f:G−→Mis a
homogeneous map of degree 2, then
f(1,1)(a,b)−f(1,1)(b,a) =f([a,b]) =f(a−1b−1ab),
holds for all a,b∈G.
Proof.Using the (1 ,1)-linearisation, one obtains
f([a,b]) =f(a−1)+f(b−1)+f(a)+f(b)+f(1,1)(a−1,a)+f(1,1)(b−1,b)
+f(1,1)(a−1,b−1)+f(1,1)(a−1,b)+f(1,1)(a,b)+f(1,1)(b−1,a).
We use that f(a−1)+f(1,1)(a−1,a)+f(a) =f(0) = 0, and that f(1,1)is linear if we interpret it as
a map deﬁned on ( G/G2)2so thatf(1,1)(a,b−1) =−f(1,1)(a,b), etc., to obtain
f([a,b]) =f(1,1)(a,b)−f(1,1)(b,a).
12Note thatρ[t]:G−→Φ⊕(A×B)[[t]] : (g1,g2)/ma√sto→1+(tg1,t2g2) can be seen as a vector group
representation if we endow Φ ⊕(A×B) with the multiplication
(λ+(a,b))(µ+(c,d)) =λµ+((µa+λc,µb+λd+ψ(a,c)).
Remark 1.24. With a vector group representation ρi:G−→C, one can associate the vector
group Imρ≤C×C, where the latter vector group is associated to the bilinear form ( a,b)−→ab
and is formed by the elements ( ρ1(g),ρ2(g)). A vector group representation induces a morphism5
G−→C×C.
Lemma 1.25. LetCbe an associative unital algebra and Ga vector group. Consider a vector
group representation (ρi:G−→C)i. For allg,h∈Gandk∈G2the following equations, in which
we writegiforρi(g), hold:
1. /parenleftbiggi+j
i/parenrightbigg
k2(i+j)=k2ik2j,
2. /parenleftbiggi+j

a+c=i
b+c=jgagb(g(−g))2c,
3.
gihj=/summationdisplay
a+c=i
b+c=jhbga[g,h]c.
Proof.The last two equations are obtained by comparing the terms belongin g to the scalar λiµjin
((λ+µ)·1g)i+j= ((λ·1g)(µ·1g)(λµ·2(g(−g)))i+j,
and
((λ·1g)(µ·1h))i+j= ((µ·1h)(λ·1g)(λµ·1[g,h]))i+j,
where the ﬁrst of these equations must hold by Lemma 1.5, and the s econd follows from a direct
computation. Similarly, one proves the ﬁrst equation of this lemma.
Deﬁnition 1.26. LetGbe a vector group. We say that ( ρi:G−→U)iis auniversal vector
group representation if for each vector group representation ( γi:G−→V)i, there exists a unique
algebra homomorphism f:U−→Vsuch thatf◦ρi=γi. Similarly, we call a homogeneous map
ρ:G−→Mof degreenauniversal homogeneous map of degree n, if for each γ:G−→Nof
degreenthere exist a unique linear map f:M−→Nsuch thatγ=f◦ρ.
Remark 1.27. Universalvectorgrouprepresentationsand universalhomogen eousmapsareunique
up to isomorphism.
Construction 1.28. We deﬁne U(G) as the unital associative algebra generated by symbols gifor
g∈Gandi∈Nand relations
5You can see this now as a Φ-group homomorphism. Later if we see thatK/mapsto→G(K) also comes from a vector
group, we can see this as a vector group homomorphism

Note that U(G) is anN-graded algebra if we set gjto bej-graded. Observe, additionally, that
all the relations imposed on U(G) are necessary to have a representation
ρi:G−→ U(G) :g/ma√sto−→gi.
So, if there exists a vector group representation to U(G), then it is obviously a universal one. We
can writeg/ma√sto→ρ[t](g) = 1+tg1+t2g2+..., as if there exists a representation, for g∈G(Φ).
We shall prove that U(G) is the universal representation for arbitrary Gby ﬁrst proving it for
freeG.
Lemma 1.29. The algebra U(G)is anN-graded Hopf algebra with operations
∆(gn) =/summationdisplay
i+j=ngi⊗gj, ǫ(gi) =δi0, S(gn) = (g−1)n.
Proof.We note that all operations are compatible with the grading, so we on ly need to check
whether we have a Hopf algebra.
The comultiplication ∆ is compatible with all the relations to which U(G) is subject as well.
There are only 2 relations that are not straightforwardly satisﬁed , as they involve binomial coeﬃ-
cients. We prove the compatibility with the comultiplication for the mos t diﬃcult relation of them,

overZ[a,b]. All other relations are either trivial or depend on the same binomial formula.
The antipode and counit are ﬁne as well since ρ[t](g)ρ[t](g−1) = 1 withρ[t](g) =/summationtexttigi.
Lemma 1.30. IfU(G)is the universal representation of Gfor all freeGoverZ, thenU(G)is the
universal representation of Gfor all (proper) G.
Proof.Suppose that Gis an arbitrary (proper) vector group. Write it as a quotient H/Kof a free
vectorgroup Husing Lemma 1.15and note that H=LΦfor some free vectorgroup LoverZ. Since
Gis proper, we know that Kis a vector group as well. We have a representation corresponding
toρi,Φ:L(Φ)−→ U(L)⊗Φ−→ U(G) ofLΦwhich factors through LΦ/K∼=Gover all scalar
extensions so that g/ma√sto→giis a representation of G.
Now, we prove that U(G) is the universal representation for all free GoverZ. To achieve that,
we construct a similar algebra X(G) which will be isomorphic to U(G).
Construction 1.31. Suppose that Gis free, letB1be a set of free generators for G/G2and let
B2be a set of free generators for G2. Take for each b∈B1an element ˆb∈Gso thatb=ˆbG2.
We assume that B1andB2are totally ordered. Consider the unital associative algebra F(G) with
generators biforb∈B1andi≥1 andb2iforb∈B2andi≥1. We use b0to denote 1 for all
b∈B1∪B2. Forg=/summationtextk
j=1λj·2bj∈G2withbi<bjfori<j, we write
g2n=/summationdisplay
i1+...+ik=nk/productdisplay
j=1λij(bj)2ij.
We impose the following relations for b<c∈B1,d<e∈B2onFto obtain X(G).

k+m=i
l+m=ibkcl[ˆc,ˆb]2m
4.d2jbi=bid2j
5.e2id2j=d2je2i.
15All of these relations hold in U(G). This is only non-trivially the case for the ﬁrst equation,
which can be restated as
ρ[t](b)ρ[s](b) =ρ[t+s](b)σ[ts](−1·2(−b)b),
whereσ[t2]=ρ[t]onG2. This relation holds in the algebra U(G) since we have imposed relations
that ensure that
ρ[t](λ·1b)ρ[t](µ·1b)σ[t2](λµ·2(−b)b) =ρ[t]((λ+µ)·1b),
and
ρ[t](g)ρ[t](h) =ρ[t](gh)
hold inU(G)[λ,µ][[t]]. So, we know that there is a unique morphism X(G)−→ U(G) which
maps on generators as bi/ma√sto→biforb∈B1∪B2. Furthermore, note that if there exists a vector
group representation GinX(G) which maps the generators b∈B1∪B2as expected, then we
obtainU(G)−→ X(G) mapping bi/ma√sto→bi. This is the case as each vector group representation
(ρi:G−→A)iinduces a map U(G)−→A, since all relations imposed to obtain U(G) must hold
inAif one writes giforρi(g). This will prove that X(G)∼=U(G) and that both are universal
representations.
We will prove that X(G) is a universal representation by proving that the elements, in whic h
the order of the products respects the orders we ﬁxed for B1andB2,

are ﬁnite sets, form a basis of X(G) utilizing the universal enveloping algebra of Lie algebras over
ﬁelds of characteristic 0.
Lemma 1.32. The module
M=/an}bracketle{tBf,g/an}bracketri}ht ⊂F,
is precisely the submodule of Fgenerated by monomials containing no expressions that are a left-
hand side of a relation imposed on Fto obtain X(G). Furthermore, any element of Fis equivalent
to an element of Mafter applying a ﬁnite amount of relations.
Proof.We note that the elements Bf,gare precisely the generating monomials of Fsuch that (1)
nob∈B1∪B2occurs multiple times as a biinBf,gand (2) there are no b,c∈B1∪B2which occur
asbi,cjwhich are not the same order as the order on B1∪B2, which is the order of B1andB2
extended by B1< B2. We note that the ﬁrst two left-hand sides of relations correspon d exactly
with possible violations of (1) and that the last three left-hand corr espond to possible violations of
(2). This proves the ﬁrst part of the lemma.
Now, we prove the furthermore-part. First, we will associate a pa ir of natural numbers ( a,b) to
a generating monomial which counts in a certain way to what degree t he monomial violates (1) and
(2). Second, we will prove that applying a relation (in the context of the lemma that is substituting
a right-hand side for a left-hand side of a relation) to such a monomia l creates a sum of monomials
associated to pairs ( c,d)<(a,b) under the lexicographicorderon N2. This will allow us to conclude
that the furthermore part holds as those pairs ( a,b) are well-ordered, i.e., there cannot exist an
inﬁnite decreasing sequence.
16With a monomial m=m1...mnwe associate the pair ( a,b) whereacounts the degree to which
(1) and (2) are violated with at least one b∈B1:
a=|{(i,j)|1≤i≤j≤n,micorresponds to b∈B1,mjcorresponds to c<b}|,
whilebis the total degree in which (1) and (2) are violated:
b=|{(i,j)|1≤i≤j≤n,micorresponds to b,mjcorresponds to c<b}|.
Observethatapplyingrelations1 ,2,4,5decreases a+bwhilepreserving aorb. Applyingrelation
3 decreases a. So, (a,b) always decreases. Using the earlier remarked fact that the pairs (a,b) are
well-ordered, we can conclude that the lemma holds.
Lemma 1.33. Suppose that Gis a free vector group over Z, the algebras X(G)andU(G)are
isomorphic and are universal representations of G.
Proof.Consider the universal enveloping algebra Uof Lie(G)⊗Q. We know that
exp[t]: Lie(G)⊗Q−→U: (g,h)/ma√sto→exp(tg,t2h) = 1+tg+t2(g2/2+h)+...
is a vector group representation of Lie( G)⊗Q∼=G(Q). This induces a vector group representation
(ρi:G−→U)i.
This means that there exists a map
X(G)−→ U(G)−→U,
using the earlier described map X(G)−→ U(G) and the fact that there exists for each vector group
representationa map with domain U(G) correspondingto that representation. Using the Poincarr´ e-
Birkhoﬀ-Witt basis, we can conclude that this map is injective since Membeds into Uand since
each element of X(G) is contained in Mmodulo the relations. Speciﬁcally, a generating monomial
Bf,g∈Mis associated to a pair of functions ( f,g). Using the lexicographical order on NB1∪B2
ﬁn sup,
we can order these Bf,g. Similarly, one orders the (slightly modiﬁed) Poincarr´ e-Birkhoﬀ-Wit t basis
elements

forb∈Bi. The representation ( ρi:G−→U)imaps to the embedding of X(G) inU. Hence,
(ρi:G−→ X(G))i
is a vector group representation. As exposed earlier, this proves thatX(G)∼=U(G) is the universal
representation. Speciﬁcally, we have a unique map from U(G) corresponding to the vector group
representation ( ρi)i, we have a map X(G)−→ U(G) corresponding to the fact that all relations on
X(G) also hold on U(G), and these maps interact nicely as they send bi/ma√sto→biforb∈B1∪B2,i∈
N.
17Theorem 1.34. LetGbe a proper vector group. There exists a universal vector gro up representa-
tion
(γi:G−→ U(G))i.
Proof.For free vector groups GoverZ, this is Lemma 1.33. For arbitrary G, this now follows from
Lemma 1.30.
Corollary 1.35. The category of proper vector groups is closed under quotien ts, i.e., suppose that
K≤Gare vector groups with Knormal inG, thenL−→G(L)/K(L)is a vector group. Moreover,
ifGis proper and K⊂Gis normal but not necessarily proper, then (G/K)is a proper vector group
as well.
Proof.ConsiderA=U(G)/IwithIthe ideal generated by U(K)∩kerǫwithǫthe counit of
the Hopf algebra. The universal representation ( γi:G−→ U(G))iinduces a representation ( ρi:
G/K−→A). The representation ( ρi)iis injective over all scalar extensions since it is injective on
Lie(G)/Lie(K) (sinceKis normal).
We remark that Kbeing proper does not matter, since L/ma√sto→K(L) has a representation in the
image of U(K)⊗Lcontained in U(G)⊗L.
So, this means that G/Kcan be given a vector group structure in A×Aas in Remark 1.24.
Theorem 1.36. LetGbe a proper vector group. Suppose that ρ:G−→Mis a homogeneous
map of degree n, then it factors uniquely through the n-th grading component of U(G). Hence, the
mappingg−→gntoU(G)ndeﬁnes the universal homogeneous map of degree n.
Proof.We proceed by induction. For n= 0, this is trivial as every homogeneous map fof degree
0 is constant, so it uniquely factors through Φ = U(G)0, mapping 1 to f(G).
Letf:G−→Mbe a homogeneous map of degree n. We prove by induction on nthat there
exists a representation
ρ[t](g) = 1+tg1+...tn−1gn−1+tnf(g)
ofGin an algebra A=U(G)<n⊕M.From this, we can obtain an algebra map
U(G)−→A
using the universality of U(G) as a vector group representation. The restriction U(G)n−→Mwill
mapgn/ma√sto→f(g) which will prove the theorem.
So, consider a homogeneous map f:G−→Mof degreenwith linearisations fi,j:G×G−→
M, which inductively correspond to linear maps gi,j:U(G)i⊗ U(G)j−→M.These maps are
associative in the following sense g(i,j),k(x,y,z) =gi,(j,k)(x,y,z) where both expressions are ( i,j,k)
linearisations of fobtained by linearizing either gi+j,korgi,j+k, since both correspond to a certain
term belonging to the coeﬃcient aibjckin
f((a·1x)(b·1y)(c·1z)).
We endow Awith the restriction of the product of U(G) toU(G)<n(where we throw away the
result if it has too high a grading), and with the obvious left and right a ction of Φ on M, while
usinggi,jfor the rest of the products U(G)i⊗ U(G)j−→M. Note that Aalgebra is associative
because of the associativity of the linearisations.
18It is easy to see that
ρ[t](g) = 1+tg1+...+tn−1gn−1+tnf(g),
forms a vector group representation. As argued earlier, this pro ves thatg/ma√sto−→gnis the universal
homogeneous map of degree n.
Remark 1.37. The following equality for homogeneous maps fdegree 3 will be useful:
3(f(g)−f(1,2)(g,g))+f(1,1,1)(g,g,g) = 0. (1.1)
This equality can be obtained from the equality
3g3−3g1g2+g3
1= 3g3−2g2g1+g1(g−1)2= 0
which holds in the universal representation. This can either be prov ed using the relations on U(G),
or one can use the following computation:
ǫ(3g3−2g2g1+g1(g−1)2) = (((1+ǫ)·1g)g−1)3= (ǫg1,2ǫg2−ǫψ(g1,g1))3= 0
over the dual numbers Φ[ ǫ].
1.3 The primitive elements of the universal representation
In this section, we are interested in projective vector groups. By Lemma 1.19, we know that
projective vector groups are proper.
Deﬁnition 1.38. LetHbe a Hopf algebra, we use P(H) to denote the set of primitive elements,
i.e., thex∈Hsuch that
∆(x) =x⊗1+1⊗x.
We call an element x∈Hgroup-like if ∆(x) =x⊗xandǫ(x) = 1.
We want to prove that P(U(G)) = Lie(G) for projective Gand be able to recover G(K) from
U(G)⊗K. In order to achieve that, we will consider concrete ﬁltrations of U(G) which will coincide
for projective vector groups G. These ﬁltrations are chosen in such a way that we know the
primitives of U(G) coincide with Lie( G) if the ﬁrst 2 parts of the ﬁltration are the same. Although
we will not explicitly prove it, the question of whether these two ﬁltra tions coincide only depends
on the module Lie( G).
Deﬁnition 1.39. Consider the space
Ym=/angbracketleftiggk1/productdisplay
i=1(v1i)m1ik2/productdisplay
j=1(v2j)2m2j|v1i∈G,v2j∈G2,k1/summationdisplay
i=1m1,i+k2/summationdisplay
j=2v2,j≤m,ki∈N/angbracketrightigg
.
We also deﬁne
Zm= ker(Id −ǫ)⊗m+1∆m,
writing Id −ǫfor Id−η◦ǫwithη: Φ−→ U(G) the structure morphism and using the operator
∆m+1= (∆m⊗Id)◦∆ with ∆1= ∆. The coassociativity guarantees that ∆m+1= (∆i⊗∆j)◦∆
for alli+j=m. We will call vector groups Gwith universal representation U(G)well-behaved if
Ym=Zmfor allm.
19Remark 1.40. By construction, the spaces Yisatisfy
Φ =Y0/subset⋉oteqlY1/subset⋉oteqlY2/subset⋉oteql...
and/uniontext
mYm=U(G).
Lemma 1.41. The spaces ZisatisfyZi⊂Zi+1for alli.
Proof.We must prove that
ker(Id−ǫ)⊗m+1∆m⊂ker(Id−ǫ)⊗m+2∆m+1.
Forp∈ U(G), we will use that
(Id−ǫ)⊗2∆(p) = ∆((Id −ǫ)(p))−(1−ǫ)p⊗1−1⊗(1−ǫ)p= (∆−I1−I2)(1−ǫ)(p),
withI1(x) =x⊗1 andI2(x) = 1⊗x. This last equation is easily checked for psuch thatp=ǫ(p),
while one can use the N-grading for psuch thatǫ(p) = 0 to prove that ∆( p) =p⊗1+1⊗p+(Id−
ǫ)⊗2∆(p). Hence, we obtain
(Id−ǫ)⊗m+2∆m+1(x) =((∆−I1−I2)⊗Id⊗m)(Id−ǫ)⊗m+1∆m(x).
This proves the lemma.
Lemma 1.42. Suppose that Gis a vector group such that
Zm−1∩Ym=Ym−1,
thenGis a well-behaved vector group.
Proof.For eachm, induction on m−kshows that
Zk∩Ym=Yk,
fork≤m, usingZk⊂Zk+1. This proves the lemma since/uniontext
mYm=U(G).
Consider
Tn1,...,nk={a∈ {1,...,k}n|iappearsnitimes ina}.
We consider a set of coset representatives Sn1,...,nk⊂S/summationtextnicorresponding to S/summationtextni/Sn1×...×Snk,
note that this set maps bijectively to Tn1,...,nkusing permutation action of Smon the element
(1,...,1,2,...,2,...,k,...,k )

Lemma 1.43. Each projective vector group is well-behaved.
20Proof.LetGbe a projective vector group. Consider dual bases ( b∗

We remark, to justify the dual maps in the previous deﬁnition, that we can use the b∗
ionU(G). For
bi∈Lie(G)1this is obvious, since we have a projection operator U(G)−→ U(G)1∼=Lie(G)1. Ifbi∈

withˆfthe map with the same deﬁnition of f, except that it maps to Y2instead ofY2/Y1. The
image ofπis Lie(G)2since it acts on linear generators as
v2/ma√sto→v2−q(v) = ((v1,v2)·(−v1,−q(v)+v2
1))2
and
a1b1/ma√sto→a1b1−q(a,b) = ((a1,q(a))·(b1,q(b))·(−(a1+b1),−q(a+b)+(a1+b1)2))2,

Now, we prove that facts as expected. Inductively applying the relations on U(G) yields

Yn+mis generated by all YnYm,nm/ne}ationslash= 0 and the gn+m,h2(n+m)forg∈G,h∈G2. This proves that
Ym−1= ker(1−ǫ)⊗m∆m−1∩Ym.
Therefore, Lemma 1.42 shows Gto be well-behaved.
Lemma 1.44. Y1∩kerǫ∼=Lie(G).
Proof.We know that Lie( G)∼=/an}bracketle{tg1,h2|g∈G,h∈G2/an}bracketri}htand thatY1is generated by these elements
and theg0, which are equal to 1.
Lemma 1.45. Z1∩kerǫ∼=P(U(G))
Proof.We know that P(U(G))⊂kerǫ. Forx∈kerǫwe know that xis primitive if and only if
∆(x)−x⊗1−1⊗x= 0
⇐⇒∆(x)−(Id⊗ǫ)∆(x)−(ǫ⊗Id)∆(x)+(ǫ⊗ǫ)∆(x) = 0
⇐⇒(Id−ǫ)⊗2∆(x) = 0
⇐⇒x∈Z1,
using thatµ(ǫ⊗Id)∆ = Id = µ(Id⊗ǫ)∆ andǫ⊗2∆ = ∆ǫ.
22Theorem 1.46. IfGis a projective vector group, then P(U(G))is isomorphic to Lie(G). Conse-
quently, the group G(K)can be recovered from the universal representation, using
{g= 1+tg1+t2g2+...∈(U(G)⊗K)[[t]]|∆(g) =g⊗g,gi∈ U(G)i⊗K}∼=G(K).
Proof.Lemmas 1.43, 1.44, and 1.45 prove that P(U(G))∼=Lie(G).
Now, we prove that each group-like element
g=∞/summationdisplay
i=1tigi,
withgi∈ U(G)i⊗Kis contained in the image of G(K) under the universal representation. Remark
that the ﬁrst nonzero gimust be primitive, so that the ﬁrst nonzero gimust be contained in
Lie(G)⊗K. We can use this to write
g=h1h2,
withh1∈G(K), h2∈G2(K) such that h1andgshare the ﬁrst coordinate and h2andh−1
1gshare
the second coordinate.
Remark 1.47. In this section, we deﬁned vector groups using
G≤A1×...×An,
withn= 2 since these are the only vector groups we need in this article. It is possible to generalize
what we have done here and give an exact way to construct group f unctorsK/ma√sto→G(K) fromG(Φ)
alone that are equivalent as a class of groups to groups of formal p ower series K/ma√sto→ {1+tg1+t2g2+

withGi(K) ={g∈G(K)|gk= 0,k= 1,...,i−1}and for which there exists isuch thatGi= 0
(this restriction can be lifted by considering direct limits). In that ca se, we have Lie( G) =G/G2×

2 Pairs of vector group representations
As before, we assume that all vector groups under consideration are proper.
Now we introduce some notation that we will use during the following se ctions. We introduce
some operators µ,νwhich depend on a pair of representations of vector groups. Thes e operators
will be useful if one wants, for example, to consider the group gene rated by two vector group
representations.
We choose to focus on the conjugation ( g,h)/ma√sto→ghg−1to express the relation between the
groups, however using ( g,h)/ma√sto→gh,(g,h)/ma√sto→[g,h] one could deﬁne similar operators replacing the
µwe shall deﬁne, to which everything else can be translated.
23Deﬁnition 2.1. LetG+,G−be vector groups and let
(ρ+
i:G+−→A)i
and
(ρ−
i:G−−→A)i
be vector group representations. Consider the functions
µi,j,νi,j:G+×G−−→A,

gcd(i,j)=1
(i,j)∈N×(N>0)/parenleftigg
1+∞/summationdisplay
k=1skitkjνki,kj(x,y)/parenrightigg
,
where the order of multiplication on the ( i,j),(k,l)∈N×(N>0) corresponds to il<jk. Similarly,
we deﬁneµ,ν:G−×G+−→A.
Lemma 2.2. The mapsµi,j,νi,j:G+×G−−→Aare well-deﬁned.
Proof.This is obviously the case for µ. Forν, one can use recursion on the degrees to compute the
ν’s uniquely. Speciﬁcally, we can compute νl,musing induction on l+m, by observing that νl,mis,
recursively, the only undeﬁned term of

1+∞/summationdisplay
k=1skitkjνki,kj(x,y)/parenrightigg
when both expressions are considered in A[s,t]/(sl+1,tm+1).
Remark 2.3. We remark that µi,j(x,y) =/summationtext
a+b=ixayj(x−1)b. The maps νi,jcan be computed
recursively, starting from ν0,i=µ0,i,νi,1=µi,1and thenνi,2+/summationtext
a+b=i
a<bνa,1νb,1=µi,2. For higher
kwe can also ﬁnd formulas for νi,kcorresponding to the previous lemma.
Remark 2.4. The mapsµ,andνare homogeneous in both arguments. Namely, if x/ma√sto→f(x) is
homogneous, then x/ma√sto→f(x−1) is homogeneous as well and if fandgare homogeneous of degree
iandj, thenx/ma√sto→f(x)⊗g(x) is homogeneous of degree i+j. This is easily proved by using the
Hopf algebra structure of the universal representation and the property that each homogeneous
map factors through the universal representation as a linear map .
We also use
exp(oi,j(x,y),l) =/parenleftigg
1+∞/summationdisplay
k=1lkνki,kj(x,y)/parenrightigg
,
to denote the formal power series which are used to deﬁne the νi,j(x,y), where we use las the
formal scalar instead of sitj.
24Lemma 2.5. Consider a pair of vector group representations (ρ+
i:G+−→A,ρ−
i:G−−→A)to
a Hopf algebra A. Suppose that ρ±
[t](g)is group-like for all g∈G+∪G−, thenexp(oi,j(g,h),t)is
group-like as well for all i,j.
Proof.Paralleltotherecursionusedtodeﬁnethe νonecanproveinductivelythatexp( oi,j(x,y),sitj)
is a group-like element in A[s,t]/(ski+1tkj+1) when one determines νki,kj. Speciﬁcally, in the in-
ductive step one has

(i,j)∈N×N>0/parenleftigg
1+∞/summationdisplay
k=1skitkjνki,kj(x,y)/parenrightigg
mod (ski+1tkj+1),
where the left-hand side is group-like and the right-hand side is exp( oi,j(x,y),sitj) multiplied with
group-like elements. Since the group-like elements form a group, we proved the induction step.
Remark 2.6. The deﬁnition of the νi,jis roughly the same as Ditter-Shay Bi-isobaric decomposi-
tion, cfr. [15, Theorem 3.5]. We deﬁned exp( oi,j(x,y),l). It will be useful to abstract the exp and
laway. Speciﬁcally, we consider oi,jas a sequence of maps
(νki,kj:G+×G−∪G−×G+−→A)k,
which will be able to play a similar role as ρ+,ρ−. Theoi,jhave the nice property that they can
coincide with group elements of G+andG−. Furthermore, by considering the oi,jas similar to ρ±
it makes sense to speak about νk,l(x,oi,j(y)), etc..
Deﬁnition 2.7. Letρi:G−→Abe a vector group representation. We use ˆ ρ(G) to denote the
subalgebra of Agenerated by all ρi(g).Furthermore, we use H(G+,G−,ρ) to denote the algebra
/an}bracketle{tνi,i(x,y)|x∈G+,y∈G−,i∈N/an}bracketri}ht.
Remark 2.8. Now, we will formulate a theorem involving seemingly random conditions . The
conditions can be interpreted as requiring that the pair of represe ntations corresponds to a rep-
resentation of an operator Jordan-Kantor pair (which we will not d eﬁne formally), similar to a
divided power representation of Jordan pair as introduced by Faulk ner [13].
Theorem 2.9. Suppose that (ρ±
i:G±−→A)iare vector group representations of proper vector
groups such that for x∈G±,y∈G∓,
•exp(o2,1(x,y),s)∈ρ±
[s](G±),
•exp(o3,1(x,y),s2)∈ρ±
[s](G±),
•exp(oi,j(x,y),s) = 1fori>2jandi/ne}ationslash= 3j,
•there exists z∈G±such thatρ[s](z) = 1+sν3,2(x,y)+O(s2),
over all scalar extensions, then ˆρ(G−)H(G+,G−,ρ)ˆρ(G+)is a subalgebra of A.
Moreover, if ρ+andρ−are injective on projective vector groups G±, then the unique map
from the algebra Ffreely generated by U(G+)andU(G−)toAcorresponding to this representation
factors through an algebra structure on the coalgebra
H=U(G−)⊗ˆH(G+,G−,F)⊗U(G+)
25in whichy⊗ˆh⊗xrepresents the element yhxinFandˆH(G+,G−,F)is a quotient of H(G+,G−,F).
This algebra is Z-graded, if one combines the N-grading of U(G+), with the opposite of the N-grading
ofU(G−)and sets H(G+,G−,F)to be0-graded.
Proof.Proof in appendix A.
Remark 2.10. If the vector groups G±are not projective, the moreover part of the previous
theorem still holds if one replaces U(G±) by a suitable quotient in the deﬁnition of H.
Now, we prove a technical lemma to obtain the necessity of certain lin earisation formulas which
will be useful in the following sections. We extend the domains of µi,j,νi,j, so that they can also
takeok,l(x,y) as input. We use ν(a,b),(c,d)to express certain (( a,b),(c,d))-linearisations of νa+b,c+d,
corresponding to linearizing the homogeneous maps G+−→Hom(G−,A),G−−→Hom(G+,A).
Lemma 2.11. Consider a pair of vector group representations (ρ+
i:G+−→A,ρ−
i:G−−→A).
The linearisations of µcan be computed as

7.ν(1,3),2(x,g,y) = [ρ1(x),ν3,2(g,y)]+ν(1,1),1(x,g,y)ν2,1(g,y).
8. Furthermore, if ν4,1(x,y) = 0for allx∈G+,y∈G−, then we also have
(a)ν2,2(o1,1(y−1,x−1),g) =ν(2,2),2(g,x,y)−ν2,1(g,y)ν2,1(x,y)).
(b)ν3,(1,1)(y,g,x) = [ν3,1(y,g),ρ1(x)]−[ν1,1(y,x),ν2,1(y,g)],
(c)ν4,(1,1)(y,g,x) = [ν3,1(y,g),ν1,1(y,x)]+ν2,1(y,g)ν2,1(y,x).

In the rest, we write giforρi(g).
The rest are just calculations involving linearisations. These equatio ns can be proved by rewrit-

We prove, as an example, equation 8 .a, since the proof of this equation showcases all techniques
needed to prove the other cases. From the decomposition of
exp(o1,1(y−1,x−1),l)ρ[s](g)exp(o1,1(x,y),l)ρ[s](g−1) = exp(o1,1(y−1,x−1),l)/summationdisplay

as a product/productdisplay
gcd(i,j)=1,(i,j)∈(N>0)2exp(oi,j(o1,1(y−1,x−1),g),lisj),
we learn that
ν2,2((o1,1(y−1,x−1),g) =µ2,2(g,o1,1(x,y))−µ1,1(x,y)µ2,1(g,o1,1(x,y)) (2.1)
by comparing the terms belonging to l2s2and using that νl,1=µl,1. The ordinary deﬁnitions of ν
andµyield
ν2,2(x,y) =µ2,2(x,y)−y1µ2,1(x,y),
so that

must hold since ν2,2(x,y) is the second coordinate of o1,1(x,y), using the deﬁnition of µ2,·(g,·).
Equation (2.2) can be rewritten further as
µ2,2(g,o1,1(x,y)) =µ(2,2),2(g,x,y)−/summationdisplay

have

Combining Equations (2.1), (2.3), and (2.4), we obtain

andµ(2,2),1(g,x,y) = 0. Using µ2,1=ν2,1yields the equation we wanted to prove.
Remark 2.13. Once one understands how to work with the linearisations, the prev ious equations
are not that hard to prove. They are just very tedious to write do wn. All of the computations can
be expressed relatively compactly, however. For example, if one sc hematically writes ( ·,·) forµ·,·
and [·,·] forν·,·, the previous computation can be restated as
[2,2]o,g= (2,2)g,o−(1,1)x,y(2,1)g,o= ((2,2),2)−((0,1),1)((2,1),1)−/summationdisplay
i+j=2((i,0),1)((j,2),1)
= [(2,2),2]−((2,0),1)((0,2),1)−((0,0),1)((2,2),1) = [(2,2),2]−[(2,0),1][(0,2),1],
where we did not write evaluations in ( g,x,y), used the linearisation properties of µand used
expressions for νi,j’s in terms of µi,j’s. For this computation, one can express the ν’s in terms of
µ’s using
[2,2] = (2,2)−(0,1)(2,1),[4,2] = (4,2)−(1,1)(3,1).
In this last expression we dropped the term (0 ,1)(4,1), since we assume that (4 ,1) = 0 in the
lemma. Another relation that is useful in proving the previous lemma is
[3,2] = (3,2)−(0,1)(3,1)−(1,1)(2,1).
3 Operator Kantor pairs
3.1 Pre-Kantor pairs
LetG+≤A+×B+andG−≤A−×B−be a pair of proper vector groups with associated bilinear
formsψ:A×A−→B(we will not write uninformative ±signs). For ease of notation, we assume
that
Lie(G+) =A+⊕G+
2,
i.e., we assume that A+is as small as possible (one can always modify A+×B+so that this is the
case). Furthermore, we can assume that ˆG∼=Gas functors, which is possible since Gis proper.
We assume the same for G−andA−.
Lemma 3.1. LetGbe a vector group. The space [G,G]≤G2is aΦ-submodule.
Proof.By deﬁnition [ G,G]≤G2is the subgroup generated by all the commutators of G, so it is an
additive subspace. We prove that it is closed under ·2as well. This is the case, since the equation
λ·2[a,b] = [λ·1a,b]
holds for all a,b∈G.
LetMbe a module. We call a natural transformation f:G+×G−−→Mhomogeneous of
bidegree [i,j] if it is homogeneous of degree iin the ﬁrst component and of degree jin the second
component. We often use fxyto denotef(x,y) for a map that is homogeneous in both arguments.
28Assumption3.2. Throughoutthissectionwewillbeworkingwithcertainoperators Q,R,T,P,Qgrp
deﬁned for G+,G−. We assume, in this section, that these are of the following form:
•Qgrp:G+×G−−→G+: (g,h)/ma√sto→Qgrp
gh= (Qgh,Rgh) withQof bidegree [2 ,1] andRof
bidegree [4,2],
•T:G+×G−−→[G+,G+] : (g,h)/ma√sto→(0,Tgh) of bidegree [3 ,1],
•P:G+×G−−→A+: (g,h)/ma√sto→Pgh,of bidegree [3 ,2].
We also use Q,R,T,P,Qgrpto denote operators G−×G+−→Mfor the appropriate M. These
operatorsQgrp,Twill in a precise sense play the role of o2,1ando3,1of Theorem 2.9 and Pwill
play the role of ν3,2.
Deﬁnition 3.3. LetCbe an associative algebra with involution a/ma√sto→aand consider a left C-
moduleM. We call a Φ-bilinear map h:M×M−→Ca (left-)hermitian form if it satisﬁes
h(cm,n) =ch(m,n) andh(m,n) =h(n,m).
Example 3.4. Now, we will consider an example of such a set of operators that will f orm an
operator Kantor pair. This will be proved after we deﬁne operator Kantor pairs. Consider a
hermitian form h:M×M−→Cand assume that Cacts faithfully on M. The Kantor triple
system (M,Vx,y), withVx,y:M−→Mforx,y∈M(for a deﬁnition of a Kantor triple system, see
[6, section 3]), associated to this hermitian form is given by
Vx,yz=h(x,y)z+h(z,y)x−h(z,x)y.
SetG={(m,a)∈M×C|a+¯a=h(m,m),a−¯a∈ /an}bracketle{th(x,y)−h(y,x)|x,y∈M/an}bracketri}ht}with operation
(m,a)(n,b) = (m+n,a+b+h(m,n)).
We cannotguaranteethat Gisproper. So, weassumethat CandMarechosenin suchawaythat G
is proper. We remarkthat setting M′=M⊗Φ[s]/(s2−s)andC′=C⊗Φ[s]/(s2−s)with involution
c⊗s/ma√sto→¯c⊗(1−s) guaranteesthat G′is proper. Namely, we have G′
2=/an}bracketle{th(x,y)⊗s−h(y,x)⊗(1−s)/an}bracketri}ht
so thatG′
2⊗K−→ /an}bracketle{th(M,M)/an}bracketri}ht⊗Φ[s]/(s2−s)⊗Kis injective for all Φ-algebras K. Therefore, we
know there exists a realisation of ˆG′ofGsuch that Lie( ˆG′(K))∼=Lie(G′)⊗K, which proves that
G′is proper by Lemma 1.17. Deﬁne
1.Q(m,a)(n) =−h(m,n)m+an,
2.T(m,a)(n) =h(m,an)−h(an,m),
3.P(m,a)(n,b) =−h(m,n)Q(m,a)(n)−abm,
4.R(m,a)(n,b) =ab¯a+h(m,n)ah(n,m)−h(m,n)h(m,an).
A direct computation shows that Qgrp
gh= (Qgh,Rgh) is an operator mapping to G. At the end of
this section we will prove that ( G,G,Qgrp,T,P) forms an operator Kantor pair if 1 /2∈Φ or if
/an}bracketle{tc−¯c|(a,c)∈G/an}bracketri}ht ⊆[G,G]. (3.1)
Once again, we remark that this assumption holds whenever we cons iderM′andC′instead ofM
andC. One can recover the original Kantor triple system using
Vx,yz=−Q(1,1)
z,xy,
withQ(1,1)the (1,1)-linearisation of Q.
29Deﬁnition 3.5. We want to deﬁne certain new operators V,τ:G+×G−−→End(G+)×End(G−),
and also deﬁne them on G−×G+. In this deﬁnition we write V+
g,h,V−
g,hfor the projections of Vg,h
as endomorphisms of G+,G−(outside the scope of this deﬁnition, we will just write V). We do the
same forτ. Usef(i,j)to denote the ( i,j)-linearisation fto the ﬁrst component. For x,g∈Gǫand
y∈G−ǫ,ǫ∈ {±}, we put
Vǫ
y−1,x−1g= (Q(1,1)
g,xy,T(2,1)
g,xy+ψ(Q(1,1)
g,xy,g))
and
τǫ
y−1,x−1g= (P(1,2)
g,xy,R(2,2)
g,xy−ψ(Qgy,Qxy)+ψ(P(1,2)
g,xy,g)).
Sofarwe havedeﬁned Vǫ,τǫonG−ǫ×Gǫ. Now, wewanttodeﬁne Vǫ,τǫwhen these takearguments
inGǫ×G−ǫ.
By working over Φ[ η] withη3= 0 and taking elements in G±≤G±(Φ[η]) under the canonical
embedding, we can rewrite the deﬁnition of V+,τ+as
/parenleftig
1+ηV+
y−1,x−1+η2τ+
y−1,x−1/parenrightig
(g) =/parenleftig
ηQ(1,1)
g,xy+η2P(1,2)
g,xy,ηT(2,1)
g,xy+η2R(2,2)
g,xy−η2ψ(Qgy,Qxy)/parenrightig
·g,
forx,g∈G+,y∈G−.
We use
(1+ηVǫ
x,y+η2τǫ
x,y)(1+ηVǫ
y−1,x−1+η2τǫ
y−1,x−1) = 1
to deﬁneVǫ
x,yandτǫ
x,yfrom the already deﬁned Vǫ
y−1,x−1,τǫ
y−1,x−1.
Remark 3.6. Note that the deﬁnition of Vandτis not that easy to give, although it could be
easier forVsinceVx,y=−Vy−1,x−1. We extended the deﬁnition using
(1+ηVx,y+η2τx,y)(1+ηVy−1,x−1+η2τy−1,x−1) = 1,
which encodes the relationship between the very diﬃcult to deﬁne op eratorτand the more easily
deﬁnedV. This relationship corresponds to the fact that ( G+,G−)−→(G−,G+) : (x,y)/ma√sto−→
(y−1,x−1) corresponds to oi,j(x,y)/ma√sto→oj,i(y−1,x−1)−1for any pair of vector group representations.
Remark 3.7. If one were to use Q=ν2,1,T=ν3,1,P=ν3,2,R=ν4,2for some vector group
representations (later we shall see that the operators can alway s be understood in this way), then
one can check that the deﬁnition of Vy−1,x−1andτy1,x−1is derived from the conjugation action
of exp(o1,1(y−1,x−1,η)).We can uniquely recover the deﬁnition of Vfrom equations 2 and 4 of
Lemma 2.12, where one can think of the left-hand side of those equa tions as representing
[Vy−1,x−1,ρi(g)].
Similarly, one can uniquely recover the deﬁnition of τfrom equations 3 and 8 .a, where we gave ex-
pressionsν2,i(o1,1(y−1,x−1),g) insteadofthe usualconjugationaction µ2,i(o1,1(y−1,x−1),g) (which
is no problem since one can easily go back and forth between νi,j’s andµi,j’s).
From now onward we do not make a distinction between homogeneous mapsf:G±−→Mof
degree 1, and linear maps A±−→M. In particular, we can write Vy,x=V−y,−x=Vy−1,x−1. We
use the same convention to identify the commutator on Lie( G) and the commutator on G, using
[a,b] = [(a,·),(b,·)].
30Deﬁnition 3.8. 1. Letf:G±×G∓−→Mbe a map deﬁned on a product of vector groups
which is homogeneous of degree nin the ﬁrst component and of degree min the second
component. We use f(i,j)to denote the linearisation of fin the ﬁrst component, f(n,(i,j))to
denote the linearisation of fin the second component, and f((i,j),(k,l))if we use linearisations
in both components. The reason for this asymmetry in notation is th at the ﬁrst component
infplays conceptually a more important role. The used notation g/ma√sto→fgcan be interpreted
as corresponding to a natural transformation G±−→Nat(G∓,M).
2. Consider a pair ( G+,G−) of proper vector groups with the assumed operators Q,T,P,R .
A pair of automorphisms ( a,b) ofG+andG−is called an automorphism if it preserves
the operators, i.e., a(Ogh) =Oag(bh), b(Ohg) =Obh(ag),forO=Qgrp,T,Pandg∈
G+,h∈G−. To say that Qgrpis preserved can be restated as a1(Qgh) =Q(ag)(bh) and
a2(Qgrp
gh) =Ra(g)(bh), if one writes a(g) = (a1(g),a2(g)).
Deﬁnition 3.9. Let (G+,G−) be a pair of vector groups such that
g(−g)∈[G±,G±] forg∈G±. (3.2)
We also assume that
G±
2−→HomΦ(A∓,A±) :s/ma√sto−→Qsis injective. (3.3)
We call (G+,G−,Qgrp,T,P) apre-Kantor pair if
1. 1+ǫVx,yis an automorphism over Φ[ ǫ] withǫ2= 0
2.T(1,2)
a,gy= [a,Qgy],
3.P(2,1)
g,ay=QgQy−1a−Va,yQgy,
4.P(3,(1,1))
g(y1,y2) =QTgy1y2−Vg,y2Qgy1,
5.R(3,1)
g,ay=TgQy−1a−Va,yTgy+ψ(Qgy,Q(1,1)
g,ay),
6.R(1,3)
a,gy= [a,Pgy]+ψ(Q(1,1)
a,gy,Qgy),
7.R(4,(1,1))
g(a,b) =−Vg,bTga+ψ(Qga,Qgb).
We assume that these equalities hold over all scalar extensions.
Remark 3.10. If 1/2∈Φ, then Condition (3.2) ensures that G±
2= [G±,G±] since
(0,2s) = (0,s)(0,s) = (0,s)(−1·1(0,s))∈[G±,G±].
Later we will see that this equation ensures the existence of a Lie alg ebra with grading element
associated to a Kantor pair such that both G±are groups of exponentials (in the usual sense if
1/6∈Φ and in a more general sense if only 1 /2∈Φ). Conditions (3.2), (3.3) correspond thus,
if 1/6∈Φ, precisely to the conditions [8, Proposition 7.5] for a Jordan-Kant or pair to come from
a Kantor pair (using that the action of the Jordan part will be faithf ul if and only if s/ma√sto→Qsis
injective on G2).
31Lemma 3.11. Let(G+,G−)be a pre-Kantor pair. Let P′be a homogeneous map G+×G−−→A+
with the same linearisations as P, then
Pxy=P′
xy
for allx∈G+,y∈G−. Furthermore, Pis determined uniquely by QandT.
Proof.Recall Theorem 1.36, i.e., g/ma√sto→gn∈ U(G)nis the universal homogeneous map of degree n,
so that equalities in the universal representation induce equalities f or all homogeneous maps. First,
we use that Pis homogeneous of degree 3 in the ﬁrst argument, so that
3Pxy= 3P(1,2)
x,xy−P(1,1,1)
x,x,xy,
since
3x3= 3x1x2−x3
1
holds in the universal representation. Second, we use that Pis homogeneous of degree 2 in the
second component and that there exists ai,bisuch thaty(−y) =/summationtextn
i=1[ai,bi] by (3.2), to obtain
2Pxy=P(3,(1,1))
x(y,y)+n/summationdisplay
i=1P(3,(1,1))
x(ai,bi)−P(3,(1,1))
x(bi,ai),
since 2y2−y2
1=/summationtextn
i=1[ai,bi] in the universal representation. These two combined yield that
Pxy= (3−2)Pxy= 3P(1,2)
x,xy−P(1,1,1)
x,x,xy−P(3,(1,1))
x(y,y)−n/summationdisplay
i=1P(3,(1,1))
x(ai,bi)−P(3,(1,1))
x(bi,ai).
Hence,Pis uniquely determined by its linearisations. So, we conclude that Pxy=P′
xy. For the
furthermore part, note that the linearisations of Pgiven in the deﬁnition of a pre-Kantor pair are
expressions only involving Q,T,and linearisations of these operators ( Vis deﬁned in terms of these
linearisations).
Deﬁnition 3.12. Consider an automorphism 1+ ǫδ= (1+ǫδ+,1+ǫδ−) over Φ[ǫ] withǫ2= 0, of
a pre-Kantor pair. We call δ= (δ+,δ−) aderivation of the pre-Kantor pair. For derivations δ1,δ2
we deﬁne [δ1,δ2] using
[1+ǫ1δ1,1+ǫ2δ2] = 1+ǫ1ǫ2[δ1,δ2],
overΦ[ǫ1,ǫ2] withǫ2
i= 0 fori= 1,2. On the universalrepresentations of the vectorgroups G+,G−,
we have
[δ1,δ2] =δ1δ2−δ2δ1.
Lemma 3.13. Let(G+,G−)be a pre-Kantor pair. Take, x,u,c,d ∈G+,y,v,a,b ∈G−. The
equations
1.[Vx,y,Vu,v] =VVx,yu,v−Vu,Vy,xv,
2.τx,[a,b]=VQxa,b+[Vx,a,Vx,b]−VQxb,a,
3.τ[c,d],y−1=VQyd,c+[Vy,d,Vy,c]−VQyc,d
hold.
32Proof.The ﬁrst equation holds since Vis a derivation by item (3.a) of Deﬁnition 3.9, Vx,y=−Vy,x
and sinceVis entirely deﬁned using linearisations of the operators. We note tha t the second and
third equations are equivalent, since τx,[a,b]=−τ[a,b],x−1=τ[b,a],x−1holds by deﬁnition. We prove
the second (and also third equation) in Appendix B.2 by proving that τ(2,(1,1))
x,a,b=VQxa,b+Vx,aVx,b,
which is suﬃcient since τx,[a,b]=τ(2,(1,1))
x,a,b−τ(2,(1,1))
x,b,aas can be proved by applying Lemma 1.23 to
the homogeneous map g/ma√sto→τx,g.
Deﬁnition 3.14. Let (G+,G−) be a pre-Kantor pair. For each invertible λinKwe have an
automorphism of ( G+
K,G−
K), namely ( g/ma√sto→λ·1g,g/ma√sto→λ−1·1g) by the assumptions on the degrees
of the operators. Consider the automorphism associated to (1+ ǫ), and write its action on G+and
G−additively as (1+ ǫζ,1+ǫζ). We see that ζ(g1,g2) = (±g1,±2g2) forg∈G±. We call
InStr(G) =/an}bracketle{tVx,y|x∈G±,y∈G∓/an}bracketri}ht+/an}bracketle{tζ/an}bracketri}ht,
with operation [ a,b] theinner structure algebra6andζthegrading element . The previous lemma
proves that derivations τx,[a,b],τ[a,b],xare contained in InStr( G).
Lemma 3.15. The module InStr (G)forms a Lie algebra with operation [·,·].
Proof.For derivations D,D′of (G+,G−,Qgrp,T,P) and arbitrary x∈G+,y∈G−, we compute
[D,[D′,Vx,y]]−[D′,[D,Vx,y]] =V(DD′−D′D)x,y+Vx,(DD′−D′D)y=V[D,D′]x,y+Vx,[D,D′]y= [[D,D′],Vx,y]
using that [ E,Vx,y] =VEx,y+Vx,Eyfor all derivations E. The Jacobi identity now follows for
arbitrary triples a+λaζ,b+λbζ,c+λcζof elements, with a,b,clinear combinations of Vx,y’s and
λa,λb,λc∈Φ, since the bracket is alternating and linear.
We want to deﬁne a 5-graded Lie algebra structure on
L(G+,G−) = [G−,G−]⊕A−⊕InStr(G+,G−)⊕A+⊕[G+,G+].
To achieve that, we endow L(G+,G−) with the unique alternating operation [ ·,·] such that
•A+⊕[G+,G+] is a Lie subalgebra of Lie( G+), i.e., [(a,b),(c,d)] = [a,c] =ψ(a,c)−ψ(c,a),
•A−⊕[G−,G−] is a Lie subalgebra of Lie( G−),
•InStr embeds into L(G+,G−) as a Lie algebra,
•[δ,g] =δ(g) forg∈[G±,G±],δ∈InStr(G),
•[δ,a] =δ1(a),fora∈A±,δ∈InStr(G) i.e., we compute the action of δby only looking at the
ﬁrst component so that
[Vx,y,a] =−Q(1,1)
a,xy,
and
[ζ,a] =±a,
with the sign corresponding to whether a∈A+orA−,
6We do not call it the inner derivation algebra, as there could be some more morphisms which should fall under
that name if 1 /2/∈Φ, namely if gortinG2thenτ(g,t) should correspond to a derivation.
33•[a,b] =Va,bfora∈A+,b∈A−,
•[g,h] =τg,hforg∈[G+,G+],h∈[G−,G−],
•[g,b] =Qgbforg∈[G±,G±],b∈A∓.
We remark that [ b,a] =Vb,a=−Va,band [g,h] =τg,h=−τh,g, so thatL(G+,G−)∼=L(G−,G+).
Lemma 3.16. Consider a pre-Kantor pair (G+,G−). The algebra L(G+,G−)is a Lie algebra.
Proof.SetL+=A+⊕[G+,G+],L0= InStr(G+,G−) andL−=A−⊕[G−,G−].SinceL0is a Lie
algebra that acts as derivations on the Lie algebra L+, we know that
L0⊕L+
forms a Lie algebra.
We only need to check the Jacobi identity. As we check this identity w e can assume without
loss of generality that a,b∈L+∪L0and thatc∈L−. Suppose that a,b∈L0, then we are already
ﬁnished since we know that L−⊕L0forms a Lie algebra. So, suppose that b∈L0anda∈L+.
Note that all automorphisms of the pre-Kantor pair preserve the Lie bracket of L, so that
(1+ǫb)[a,c] = [(1+ǫb)a,(1+ǫb)c],
forb∈L0. This proves the Jacobi identity if b∈L0.
So, we can assume that a,b∈L+,c∈L−.
Suppose ﬁrst that c∈A−Fora,b∈A+, the Jacobi identity follows from
[[a,b],c] =Q[a,b]c=Q(1,1)
a,bc−Q(1,1)
b,ac=−Vb,ca+Va,cb= [[a,c],b]+[a,[b,c]]
by using Lemma 1.23 for the second step. If a,b∈A+∪[G+,G+] but not both in A+, then we
need to check that
[a,[b,c]] = [b,[a,c]].
Assume that a∈A+,b∈[G+,G+]. So, must check
[a,Qbc] =−Va,cb.
This is equivalent to checking that
T(1,2)
a,bc= [a,Qbc] =−Va,cb=T(2,1)
b,a,
using Deﬁnition 3.9.2 for the linearization of Tand Deﬁnition 3.5 for V. The previous equation
holds since T(t·1g)b=Tb(t·1g)for allg∈G(Φ[t]) with ﬁrst coordinate asinceb∈G2. If both
a,b∈[G+,G+], then the Jacobi-identity is trivially satisﬁed by the grading.
Assume now that c∈[G−,G−]. If botha,b∈A+, then Lemma 3.13 shows that the Jacobi
identity holds, since
[c,[a,b]] =τc,[a,b]=VQca,b−VQcb,a= [[c,a],b]−[[c,b],a].
Lastly, if both a,b∈A+∪[G+,G+] and if it is not the case that both are contained in A+,then
we must show that
[a,[b,c]] = [b,[a,c]],
34which is the case if both a,b∈[G+,G+] since the previous equation becomes
−τb,ca=R(2,2)
a,bc=R(2,2)
b,ac=−τa,cb,
using Deﬁnition 3.5 for τ, which holds since Φ[ t]-scalar multiples of aandbcommute. So, suppose
thata∈A+andb∈[G+,G+], then the equation reduces to
P(1,2)
a,bc=−QbQca,
which is the case since P(1,2)
a,bc=P(2,1)
b,ac=−QbQcausing Deﬁnition 3.9.3.
Wearealmostﬁnishedwithourexpositiononpre-Kantorpairs. Befo reweendtheexposition,we
ﬁrst establish a link with Kantorpairs as they appear in the literature and secondly construct a pair
of vector group representations of pre-Kantor pair in the endom orphism algebra of the associated
Lie algebra.
Deﬁnition 3.17. Suppose that ( A+,A−) is a pair of modules over Φ and that W:A+×A−−→
End(A+)×End(A−) is a linear map. We write Va,bcforWa,bcwhenevera,c∈A+andb∈A−
and writeVb,acfor−Wa,bcwhenevera∈A+andb,c∈A−. Furthermore, we write Ka,bcfor
Va,cb−Vb,ca. We call (A+,A−,W) aKantor pair if

2.Va,bKc,d+Kc,dVb,a=KKc,db,aifa,c,d∈Aǫ,b∈A−ǫ,

Lemma 3.18. Consider a pre-Kantor pair (G+,G−,Qgrp,T,P). DeﬁneA±=G±/G±
2, the triple
(A+,A−,V|A+×A−)forms a Kantor pair. Moreover, if 1/6∈Φthen(G+,G−,Qgrp,T,P)can be
uniquely recovered from (A+,A−,V|A+×A−).
Proof.This immediately follows from the fact that L=L(G+,G−) is a Lie algebra. More precisely,
sinceLis aZ/2Z-graded algebra with as 1-graded part A+⊕A−, we can conclude that A+⊕A−
is a Lie triple system with operation [ aǫ,b−ǫ,cǫ] =Va,bc,[aǫ,bǫ,cǫ] = 0 where xǫis contained in
Aǫforx=a,b,c. Allison and Faulkner proved [6, Equations (2) and (3)]7that this implies that
(A+,A−,V) is a Kantor pair.
If 1/6∈Φ, then we know that G+∼=A+⊕{a/ma√sto→Vx,ay−Vy,ax|x,y∈A+}with group operation
determined by
ψ(a,b) =c/ma√sto→(Va,cb−Vb,ca)/2
sinceG2= [G,G],G2∼=QG2as modules, and since Qmust satisfy

a,bc−Q(1,1)
b,ac=Va,cb−Vb,ca.
The operators Q,T,PandRare determined by their linearisations. To be precise, if x(−x) =/summationtextn
i=1[ai,bi], y(−y) =/summationtextm
i=1[ci,di], then we know that

We deﬁne an action of G±onL(G+,G−). Namely, for g= (a,b)∈G±we deﬁne
exp(g) = 1+g1+g2+g3+g4,
using the following endomorphisms of L(G+,G−):
g1·z= [a,z]
g2·z=

Remark that ( ǫz(g)1,−ǫˆz(g)) = ((1+ǫz)(g))g−1for all derivations z.
Remark 3.19. Observe that g2·ζ∈[G+,G+] forg∈G+sinceg(−g) = (ζ(g))2−ψ(ζ(g),g). We
also note that Rgz∈[G+,G+] forz∈[G−,G−]. This can be observed by considering
Rg[a,b] =R(4,(1,1))
g(a,b)−R(4,(1,1))(b,a)
and the (4,(1,1)) linearisation of Rgiven in the deﬁnition of a pre-Kantor pair.
In what follows, we will often write Lto denote the Lie algebra L(G+,G−) ifGis clear from
the context.
Lemma 3.20. The maps (G−→EndΦ(L) :g/ma√sto→gi)iform a vector group representation, with
gi= 0fori>4.
36Proof.It is suﬃcient to prove that g/ma√sto→giis a homogeneous map with ( k,l)-linearisation ( g,h)k,l=
gkhl. Since the giare deﬁned using homogeneous maps, we only need to prove that th e (k,l)-
linearisations are what they should be.
Wealreadyknowthat g/ma√sto→g1islinear. For g2wecheckwhetherthe(1 ,1)-linearisationevaluated
in (a,b)∈A+×A+applied to the deﬁnition coincides with a1b1. So, we check whether
τ((1,1),2)
a,b,z=−Va,Qzb,
Q(1,1)
a,bz=−Vb,za,
−(z(a,b))(1,1)+ψ(z(a),b)+ψ(z(b),a) = [a,z(b)],
i.e., we check all the nontrivial cases in the deﬁnition of g2·z. The ﬁrst case holds by Lemma B.2,
which is proved in the appendix, and since z∈G2. The second case holds by deﬁnition. The last
case follows from ( z(a,b))(1,1)=ψ(z(a),b)+ψ(a,z(b)), which can be proved using that (1+ ǫz) is
an automorphism.
Most linearisations of g3andg4are directly observed to be what they should be, as can be seen
from the linearisations of T, PandRthat are ﬁxed in the deﬁnition pre-Kantor pairs. The other
linearisations play a role in the deﬁnition of Vandτinvolving the linearisations of T, PandR.
In these cases a direct computation shows that the linearisations a re what they should be. For
example, we can compute for Tthat
T(2,1)
g,x(y) = (Vy,xg)2−ψ(Vy,xg,g) =−g2·Vy,x=g2x1·y.
The homogeneous maps gn= 0 for all n>4 have trivial linearisations, as implied by the grading
of the Lie algebra.
3.2 Operator Kantor pairs
Deﬁnition 3.21. We call a pre-Kantor pair ( G+,G−) anoperator Kantor pair if
1.τx,T(2,1)
y,a(x)+Vx,QyQx−1a+τy,Tx−1a=VPxy,a+VQTxya,y−[Vx,y,VQxy,a],

xya+[Pxy,QTxya]+Vx,y[Qxy,QTxya] =RxTyQx−1a+TxPyTx−1a,
hold for all x∈Gǫ(K),y∈G−ǫ(K),a∈A−ǫ⊗K. The ﬁrst three equations express, using the
representations g/ma√sto→gi∈EndΦ(L) and associated operators µi,j,νi,j, precisely that
1.µ3,2(x,y) acts asa/ma√sto→VPxy,a+VQTxya,y−[Vx,y,VQxy,a] onA−ǫ,
2.µ4,2(x,y) acts asa/ma√sto→QQgrp

3.µ5,2(x,y) acts asa/ma√sto→[Qxy,QTxya] onA−ǫ.

37Remark 3.22. If 1/30∈Φ, then each pre-Kantor pair is an operator Kantor pair. We prove this
in Corollary 4.5.
Remark 3.23. A suﬃcient condition, which will be easier to use in practice, for the pr evious
equations to hold, is given by the following list of properties:
1. exp(g) is an automorphism for g∈G+andG−,
2.ν3,2(x,y) = adPxy,
3.ν4,2(x,y) = (Qgrp
xy)2,
4.ν5,2(x,y) = 0,
5.ν6,3(x,y) = (Qgrp
xy)3.
These conditions are suﬃcient since one obtains the axioms of an ope rator Kantor pair by (1)
expressing the νi,jas a sum of products µk,land (2) evaluating the endomorphisms on A−. The
µi,jthat must be of a speciﬁc form to obtain the precise equation of the deﬁnition, are µ1,1(x,y) =
adVx,y, µ2,1(x,y) = adQxy,µ3,1(x,y) = adTxyandµ4,1(x,y) = 0. Using the assumption that
exp(g) is an automorphism one sees that the equation µi,1(x,y) = ad exp( x)i(y) always holds. We
remark that these conditions are not only suﬃcient but necessary as well. In the next lemma we
prove that exp( g) is an automorphism and we argue in the second part of Theorem 3.26 , in which
we prove that we can apply Theorem 2.9, that the other equations h old.
Remark 3.24. For operator Kantor pairs, the operators PandRcan be determined from Q,T
andV. We already proved this for Pin Lemma 3.11. We want to prove the it for R. We determine
Rfor all ﬂat Φ-algebras Kand note that this lets us determine the value for all Rxyover all
Φ-algebras using naturality. So, consider the set S={(Qgh,t)∈G(K)}for ﬂatK. There exists a
k∈S, namely (Qgrp
xy), which satisﬁes
k2·a=ν4,2(x,y)·a= (µ4,2(x,y)−µ1,1(x,y)µ3,1(x,y))·a
for alla∈A−, using that ν4,2(x,y) = (Qgrp
xy)2. Thiskis unique by Equation (3.3) and the ﬂatness
ofK, since
(k(0,s))2·a=k2·a+Q(0,s)·a.
So, if
(µ4,2(x,y)−µ1,1(x,y)µ3,1(x,y))·a
is an element of A+which can be expressed using Q,T,P,V, then we know that Ris uniquely
determined by the other operators. Evaluating this normally yields s uch an expression if one
substitutes −τy,Tx−1ax=P(1,2)
x,Tx−1ay−1,for the contribution of x1y2x−1
3·ainµ4,2(x,y)·a.
Lemma 3.25. Let(G+,G−)be an operator Kantor pair and take g∈G±. The map exp(g)is an
automorphism.
Proof.We note that exp( g) is an automorphism if
exp(g)[a,b] = [exp(g)a,exp(g)b],
38for alla,b∈L. Suppose that g∈G+, the previous identity holds if either one of aandbis an
element of L+. We illustrate this if a∈L+. In that case, the equation exp( g)(ada)exp(g−1) =
ad exp(g)aholds since we have a vector group representation, which proves t hat exp(g)[a,b] =
[exp(g)a,exp(g)b].
Similarly, using that 1+ ǫl, withǫ2= 0, is an automorphism of the operator Kantor pair for
l∈L0and that exp( g)·ǫl=ǫl−((1+ǫl)(g)·g−1) holds by deﬁnition of the action, we conclude
that exp(g) interacts nicely with brackets involving an l∈L0by observing that
ǫl−ad exp(g)·ǫl= exp((1+ǫl)g)exp(g−1)−1 = (1+ǫl)exp(g)(1−ǫl)exp(g−1)−1 =ǫl−ǫexp(g)lexp(g−1),
as maps on L(remark that we can write lfor adlif we interpret las an element of InStr( G)).
So, the only thing left to prove is that
exp(g)[a,b] = [exp(g)a,exp(g)b],
fora,b∈L−.
Ifa,b∈A−this follows from the Jacobi identity, the ( n,(1,1))-linearisations P,Rof Deﬁnition
3.9 using Lemma 1.23, and the equation
τx,[a,b]=VQxa,b+Va,Qxb+[Vx,a,Vx,b]
proved in Lemma 3.13.
Now, we assume that a∈[G−,G−] andb∈A−. We will prove that
exp(g)[a,exp(g−1)(b)] = [exp(g)(a),b], (3.4)
which proves that
exp(g)(ad exp(g−1)b)exp(g−1) = adb (3.5)
holds. Using that we already proved that exp( g) conjugates as expected with
exp(g−1)(b)−b∈InStr(G)⊕A+⊕[G+,G+]
we will be able to conclude from Equation (3.5) that
exp(g)(adb)exp(g−1) = ad exp( g)(b).
So,ifweproveEquation(3.4), thenweareabletoconcludethatexp (g)(adb)exp(g−1) = ad exp( g)(b)
for allb∈A−∪A+∪ζ, i.e., a generating set of L. This proves that exp( g)(adc)exp(g−1) =
ad exp(g)(c) for allc∈L, since we can write ad cas a polynomial function of elements ad bfor
which it holds. So, proving Equation (3.4) proves the lemma, without n eeding to consider the case
wherea,b∈[G−,G−]. So, we try to prove Equation (3.4). The ﬁrst 3 axioms for operato r Kantor
pairs show that exp( g)a2exp(g−1) = ad exp( g)(a) onA−if and only if
τg,a=g2a2−g1a2g1+a2(g−1)2
onA−. Applying the deﬁnition of τand the action of the elements gianda2on the Lie algebra,
shows us that we need to prove that
−P(1,2)
b,a(g−1) =τ(g,a)(b) = (g2a2−g1a2g1+a2(g−1)2)·b=QaQg−1b+QVb,gag.
39Using that P(2,1)
a,b(g−1) =QaQgb−Vb,gQagby Deﬁnition 3.9.3 and that P(1,2)
b,a=P(2,1)
a,b+P(2,1)
[b,a],aas
any homogeneous map of degree 3, transforms what we need to sh ow into
Qa(Qg+Qg−1)b−Vb,gQag+QVb,gag+Q[b,a]Qga−Va,gQ[b,a]g= 0.
Using that ( Qg+Qg−1)(b) =Vb,ggsinceg2+ (g−1)2=−g2
1, and that [ Qa,Vb,g]g=−QVb,gagfor
a∈G2sinceVb,gis a derivation, reduces the equation to
Va,gQ[a,b]g=Q[a,b]Qga
which holds since a∈[G−,G−] so thatVa,g= 0 andQ[a,b]= 0. This proves that Equation 3.4
holds and thus the lemma.
Theorem 3.26. Let(G+,G−)be an operator Kantor pair and let G+andG−be projective. The
Φ-group functor K−→G(K) =/an}bracketle{tG+(K),G−(K)/an}bracketri}ht ≤EndΦ(L(G+,G−))⊗Khas as corresponding
Lie algebra
L=Lie(G−)⊕L0⊕Lie(G+)
for some Lie algebra L0. This Lie algebra is 5-graded by the weights of the action of Φm(K) =K×
deﬁned byλ·(g+,g−) = (λ·1g+,λ−1·1g−)ofΦmon(G+,G−)andL0is the0graded component
of this action. Moreover, if E= 1+e1+e2+e3+e4∈G(K)withei(Lj)⊂Li+jfor alli,j, then
Emust be an element of G+(K).
Proof.We want to apply Theorem 2.9. Suppose that we can use the conclusio ns of the theorem.
Thisprovesthatthevectorgrouprepresentationsof G+,G−factorthroughsome Z-gradedbialgebra
H=U(G−)HU(G+) such that each h∈Hcan be uniquely written as/summationtextn
i=1uihiviwith all
ui∈ U(G−),vi∈ U(G+) and allhicontained in a 0-graded Hopf subalgebra H. Furthermore,
G(K) can be constructed by a quotient of the group I(K) =/an}bracketle{tρ+
[t](G+(K)),ρ−
[t](G−(K))/an}bracketri}htdeﬁned by
embedding the universal representations U(G±) inH. Speciﬁcally, take the unique map deﬁned by
1+tg1+t2g2+.../ma√sto−→1+g1+g2+g3+g4
on the generators ρ+
[t](G+(K)) andρ−
t(G−(K)) which maps I(K)−→G(K). Suppose that 1+ ǫd∈
Lie(G). We can lift this to an element FofI(K[ǫ]). Furthermore, we can assume that Fis of the
form
1+ǫf1+ǫf2+ǫf3+...,
using the fact that the image of Funderǫ/ma√sto→0 lies inI(K).Since all the generators of I(K) are
group like, i.e., satisfy ∆( i) =i⊗i,ǫ(i) = 1, we conclude that all fisatisfy ∆(fi) =fi⊗1+1⊗fi.
Lastly, note that gk/ma√sto→0 for allk >4 and allg∈G+,G−, i.e., 1+ti1+t2i2+...∈I(K) implies
that there exists some Nsuch thatik/ma√sto→0 ifk≥N. So, we conclude that there exists a primitive
element/summationtextN
i=1fiwhich maps to d. Since each primitive element of Hcan be uniquely written as a
sum/summationtextuihivi, it is not hard to check that each primitive element can be uniquely dec omposed as
p=u1+h2+v3withu1,h2,v3primitive using ( πU(G−)⊗πH⊗πU(G+))∆2(yhx) =y⊗h⊗x. If we
assume that dhas no 0-graded component, then we can conclude that d∈Lie(G+)⊕Lie(G−).
If the conditions of Theorem 2.9 apply, then one also proves the mor eover part in a similar
fashion. Namely, one can ﬁnd a lift for EinI(K) using the fact that all group-like elements hinH
such thath−1 has only positively graded components, must lie in U(G+) and then apply Theorem
1.46 to conclude that h∈G+(K).
40So, now we prove that the conditions of Theorem 2.9 apply. It is suﬃc ient to prove that
exp(Oi1
xy) = 1+4/summationdisplay
k=1ν(ki),k(x,y),
forO21=QgrpandO31=T, that
ν4,1,ν5,1,ν5,2,ν7,3= 0
and that
ν3,2(x,y) = adPxy
forx∈G+andy∈G−(orwiththerolesof xandyreversed)and l∈A+. Tosimplifythistask,note
that there are no nontrivial derivations d:L(G+,G−)−→L(G+,G−) so thatd(L(G+,G−)i)⊂
L(G+,G−)i+kwith|k| ≥4 sinceL(G+,G−) is generated by A+,A−andζ. Furthermore, one
computes, using the fact that exp( g) is an automorphism for all g, that
exp(oi,j(x,y)) =∞/summationdisplay
k=0νki,kj(x,y),
is an automorphism as well (similar to Lemma 2.5), proving, in particular , that the νi,jwith
|i−j| ≥4 are uniquely determined by the νk,lwith|k−l|<4 andi/j=k/l, as allνi,jare
determined by those smaller νk,lup to a derivation. The previous observations reduce what we
need to prove to
1.ν2,1(x,y) = adQxy
2.ν4,2(x,y) = (Qgrp
xy)2,
3.ν6,3(x,y) = (Qgrp
xy)3
4.ν3,1(x,y) = adTxy
5.ν4,1(x,y) =ν5,2(x,y) = 0
6.ν3,2(x,y) = adl= adPxy.
Forνi,1(x,y) =µi,1(x,y) this follows from the fact that exp( x) is an automorphism. Note that
ν5,2(x,y) is a derivation on L(G+,G−) which acts as +3 on the grading. So, the action given in
the deﬁnition of an operator Kantor pair determines ν5,2(x,y) uniquely since that the third axiom
for operator Kantor pairs implies that µ5,2(x,y)−ν2,1(x,y)ν3,1(x,y) = 0 onA−. Similarly, the
fourth axiom guarantees that ν6,3(x,y) = (Qgrp
xy)3if we can prove that the other equations hold.
So, we only need to consider ν4,2(x,y) andν3,2(x,y). The element ν4,2acts trivially on A+and
acts as expected on A−. Evaluating on the grading derivation gives us an element that acts a s
an inner derivation of the Lie algebra. This evaluation yields ν4,2(x,y)·ζwhich is an element
that acts like the endomorphism −2ν4,2(x,y) +ν2,1(x,y)2. This last endomorphism acts exactly
as (0,−2Rxy+ψ(Qxy,Qxy))2onA−, which proves that ν4,2(x,y) acts as (Qgrp
xy)2sinceG+
2acts
faithfully on A−.
Note that
ν3,2(x,y)·ζ=−l∈A+.
41Using the fact that ν3,2is a derivation, we conclude ad l=ν3,2(x,y). We know that ( x,y)/ma√sto→
−ν3,2(x,y)·lis a homogeneous map with the same linearisations, by Lemma 2.12, as P, hence
l=Pxyby Lemma 3.11. This ﬁnishes the proof.
Remark 3.27. It could very well be true that the previous theorem holds without t he assumption
thatG+andG−are projective. One can, however, also drop the projective assu mption in order
to get a weaker result. Namely, if there exists an element E∈G(K) of the form of the previous
theorem which is not contained in G+(K), then it still corresponds to a group-like element in a
Hopf quotient U+of the Hopf algebra U(G+). Similarly, the positively graded elements of the Lie
algebra Lie( G) that are not contained in Lie( G+), correspond to primitive elements of U+.
Theorem 3.28. Suppose that ρ±:G±−→Aare vector group representations of proper vector
groups such that for all x∈G±,y∈G∓,
•exp(o2,1(x,y),s)∈ρ±
s(G±),
•exp(o3,1(x,y),s2)∈ρ±
s([G±,G±]),
•exp(oi,j(x,y),s) = 1fori>2jandi/ne}ationslash= 3j,
•there exists z∈G±such thatρs(z) = 1+sν3,2(x,y)+O(s2).
SetK±={(ρ±
1(g),ρ±
2(g))∈A×A|g∈G±}.Then
(K+,K−,Qgrp=o2,1,T=o3,1,P=ν3,2)
forms an operator Kantor pair if and only if ρ2(G2)∋(0,s)/ma√sto→Q(0,s)(·)is injective and ρ±(g(−g))∈
ρ±[G±,G±].
Proof.The conditions that the (0 ,s)∈Gact faithfully and that
ρ±(g(−g))∈ρ±[G±,G±]
are necessary. Furthermore, the equations of Lemma 2.12 prove that we have a pre-Kantor pair
since these express ﬁrstly, in equations 2, 4, 3 and 8a, that the de ﬁnition ofVx,y,andτx,yis such
that the action of 1+ ηVx,y+η2τx,ycoincides with the conjugation action of exp( o1,1(x,y),η) over
Φ[η]/(η3). These equations also prove that 1+ ǫVx,yis an automorphism since the operators Q,T,
R,andPare deﬁned using multiplications in A. Thirdly, the rest of the equations also express that
the linearisations of the operators Q, R,andPare as required; the equations can be matched to
axioms for pre-Kantor pairs by matching the degrees. The lineariza tion forTfollows from Lemma
2.11 andνk,1=µk,1.
We will prove that it is an actual operator Kantor pair in Appendix A.
We use the previous theorem to prove that what we constructed in Example 3.4 is in fact an
operator Kantor pair.
Deﬁnition 3.29. We call a vector group Gwith operators Qgrp,T,Psuch that (G,G,Qgrp,T,P)
forms an operator Kantor pair, an operator Kantor system .
Lemma 3.30. The quadruple (G,Qgrp,T,P)of Example 3.4 forms an operator Kantor system if
either condition (3.1) holds and Gis proper or if 1/2∈Φ.
42Proof.We will apply Theorem 3.28. If we construct vector group represen tations so that the
operators of Example 3.4 correspond to the operators of Theore m 3.28, then it is suﬃcient to check
thatg(−g)∈[G,G] in order to prove that we have an operator Kantor pair. Condition (3.1) says
precisely this, namely ( m,a)∈Gimplies that
(m,a)(−m,a) = (0,2a−h(m,m)) = (0,a−¯a)∈[G,G].
Wedonotneedthisconditionif1 /2∈Φsince(m,a)∈Gimpliesthat a−¯a∈ /an}bracketle{th(x,y)−h(y,x)|x,y∈

Furthermore, by deﬁnition Gneeds to be proper. However, each vector group over Φ containin g
1/2 is proper.
We work with the algebra Aassociated with a Kantor pair associated to a hermitian form in
[6, section 8]. This algebra is of the form
C M C

C M C
as a Φ module with ¯MandMequal

the product of Acorresponds to a matrix product and product that not involve Eare given by the
actions ofConMand the bilinear map M×¯M−→C. We do not need the products involving E
in this proof.
We also consider the vector group representations

ing toνijusing Theorem 3.28. The decomposition of exp+(sx)exp−(ty) as exp−(tY)hexp+(sX)
for certain X,Ywithhdiagonal, can be used to compute certain formal power series in sandt.
Note that for such a decomposition exp−(ty−1)exp+(sx−1) = exp+(sX−1)h−1exp(tY−1) always
holds. The ﬁrst decomposition yields that exp+(tX) equals


,
which shows the necessity of the formulas for Q,T,P,R . With the second decomposition, one can
easily show that the omitted (and diﬃcult) expression is what it should be, which proves that the
formulas hold. Theorem 3.28 shows that we have an operator Kanto r pair.
Remark 3.31. The fact that we have an operator Kantor pair, can be used to pro ve that the
elementsXof the previous theorem is a well-deﬁned element of s·1G+[[st]] which denotes the
inverse limit of the groups s·1G+(Φ[st]/[(st)n]). ThissXcan be thought of as the quasi inverse
(sx)tywhich one often considers in the context of Jordan pairs.
434 5-graded Lie algebras over rings Φwith1/6and1/30
We assume throughout this section that 1 /6∈Φ. We use the deﬁnition of a Kantor pair ( P+,P−)
with operators Vand associated Lie algebra as given by Allison and Faulkner [6, section 3 ].
We remark that each vector group over Φ is proper.
Lemma 4.1. Let(P−,P+)be a Kantor pair with associated Lie algebra
L= [P−,P−]⊕P−⊕(Φζ⊕VP+,P−)⊕P+⊕[P+,P+].
Then the following hold
•exp(P+⊕[P+,P+]) =G+is a vector group8. This vector group can be coordinatized by
exp(e) = 1+e1+e2+e3+e4/ma√sto→(e1,e2)∈EndΦ(L)2witheithe part which acts as +ion the
grading. The similarly deﬁned G−is also a vector group.
•On these pairs (e1,e2)the operators Qgrp,T,Pare given by
–Qgrp
gh= (ν2,1(g,h),ν4,2(g,h)),
–Tgh= (0,ν3,1(g,h)),
–Pgh=ν3,2(g,h)
and satisfy the deﬁnition of a pre-Kantor pair.
Proof.The map exp : P+⊕[P+,P+]−→EndΦ(L) is injective since 1 /6∈Φ, as can be observed by
evaluatingtheexponentialsonthegradingderivation ζ. Mappingexp( g) = 1+e1+e2+.../ma√sto→(e1,e2)
is injective, since it is injective on Lie( G+). From
exp(a)exp(b) = exp(a+b+[a,b]/2),
which holds by the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ Theorem, we conclude thatP+⊕[P+,P+] is a
vector group with representation exp. The description as pairs ( e1,e2) is exactly the image of
P+⊕[P+,P+] under this representation. We choose to work with this second co ordinatization
since this allows us to deﬁne the operators more easily.
We want to check that the mentioned operators Qgrp,TandPmap toG+,G+
2andG+/G+
2.
If this is the case, then these operators automatically satisfy the part of Deﬁnition 3.9 that deter-
mines the linearisations of these operators by Lemma 2.12 and Lemma 2.11. For a more precise
correspondence between those lemmas and the deﬁnition, see the proof of Theorem 3.28.
In order to prove that the operators map to the right spaces, we assumeg= (a,b)∈G+and
h= (c,d)∈G−. We will use that gi[a,b] =/summationtext
k+l=i[gka,glb] fori≤4, which must hold since we
have 1/6∈Φ. Note that this implies νi,1(g,h) =µi,1(g,h) = ad(gi·hp),where we use hpto denote
the part in P−without the ad. In particular, this implies that QandTalready map to the right
spaces. We note that µ1,1(g,h) corresponds to the usual Vg,hoperator for Kantor pairs and that
µ4,1= 0.
For theνi,2we will use that h2is of the form
(h1)2/2+adv,
8This is the usual exponential exp( l) =/summationtext4
i=0(adl)i/(i!).
44for somev∈[P−,P−].It is easy to check that
µ(n,2)(g,h) =/summationdisplay
i+j=nµ(i,1)(g,h)µ(j,1)(g,h)/2+ad (gn·v),
forn≤4. Using this, we obtain that
ν(4,2)(g,h) =µ(2,1)(g,h)2/2+ad (g4·v)−ad(Vg,hTgh)/2,
which shows that Ggrpmaps toG+. Similarly, one proves that Pghis an inner derivation.
Note that 1 + ǫVx,y= 1 +ǫad [x,y], which we let act using conjugation on the groups, is a
vector group automorphism that interacts nicely with the deﬁned o perators. Lastly, observe that
G+
2= [G+,G+] and thatG+
2acts faithfully on P−under the adjoint action, proving that it acts
faithfully under Q(since this coincides with adjoint action).
Deﬁnition 4.2. We call the pre-Kantor pair associated to a Kantor pair, as constr ucted in the
previous lemma, the associated pre-Kantor pair .
Theorem 4.3. Suppose that 1/30∈Φand thatP= (P+,P−)is a Kantor pair over Φ. The
pre-Kantor pair associated to Pis an operator Kantor pair.
Proof.Note that we are working with the usual exponentials and one check s that these are neces-
sarily automorphisms using that 1 /30∈Φ. Note that
µm,2(x,y) =νm,2(x,y)+

y1νm,1(x,y) 1 ≤m≤2
y1ν3,1(x,y)+ν1,1(x,y)ν2,1(x,y) m= 3
ν1,1(x,y)ν3,1(x,y)+ν0,1(x,y)ν4,1(x,y) m= 4
ν2,1(x,y)ν3,1(x,y)+ν0,1(x,y)ν5,1(x,y)+ν1,1(x,y)ν4,1(x,y)m= 5
0 otherwise
and thatνk,1(x,y) = ad(xk·y1), withxkthe part of exp( x) that isk-graded. This immediately
ensures that ν4,1=ν5,1= 0. We prove that the suﬃcient conditions listed in Remark 3.23 are
satisﬁed, in order to prove that we have an operator Kantor pair. The ﬁrst, second, and third
condition follow immediately.
Similar to Lemma 2.5, one can prove that exp( oi,j(x,y)) is an automorphism for all x,y, using
that exp(x) and exp(y) are automorphisms. For the fourth, we only need to see that ν5,2acts
trivially on P−, which is the case since it is a derivation d(as it is the ﬁrst not necessarily zero
component of o5,3) that acts as +3 = 5 −2 on the grading. Namely, for i-gradedu, we compute
that
id(u) =d[ζ,u] = [ζ,d(u)] = (3+i)d(u),
so that 3d(u) = 0.
Forν6,3(x,y), recall that
exp(o2,1(x,y)) =4/summationdisplay
k=1ν2k,k(x,y)
is an automorphism. We know already that ν2,1(x,y) andν4,2(x,y) correspond to the parts of
exp(Qgrp
xy) which act as +1 and +2 on the grading. This proves that
ν6,3(x,y) =ν2,1(x,y)ν4,2(x,y)−ν2,1(x,y)3/3+d
45withda derivation. Since there are no derivations which act as +3 on the gr ading, we conclude
thatν6,3(x,y) coincides with the part of exp( Qgrp
xy) which acts as +3 on the grading.
Remark 4.4. We did only use 1 /5∈Φ to prove that the exponentials are automorphisms of the
Lie algebra.
Corollary 4.5. If1/6∈Φ, then the Kantor pairs and pre-Kantor pairs stand in a biject ive relation
given by considering the associated pre-Kantor pair to a Kan tor pair. If 1/30∈Φ, then each pre-
Kantor pair is an operator Kantor pair.
Proof.In the previous theorem and lemma, we established that each Kanto r pairP= (P+,P−)
induces a pre-Kantor pair G= (G+,G−) if 1/6∈Φ. So, it is suﬃcient to prove that P/ma√sto→G
establishes a bijection between Kantor pairs and pre-Kantor pairs if 1/6∈Φ.
We know that we can associate a Kantor pair P′to each pre-Kantor pair Gby Lemma 3.18,
from which we can uniquely recover the operators of G. Furthermore, we know that P∼=P′since
both pairs can be understood as ( G+/G+
2,G−/G−
2) with the induced action of V.
If 1/30∈Φ, Theorem 4.3 proves that Pis also an operator Kantor pair.
5 Structurable algebras
We will construct operator Kantor systems corresponding to eac h of the classes of central simple
structurable algebras as determined by Allison and Smirnov [1, 25, 26 ], i.e., associative algebras,
structurable algebras associated to a hermitian form, tensor pro ducts of composition algebras,
Smirnov algebras, skew dimension one structurable algebras, and J ordan algebras. Allison and
Faulkner [5] provedthat these classesofalgebrasarestill struct urableoverarbitraryringsofscalars,
though not in a manner related to 5-graded Lie algebras. The opera tor Kantor pairs will have
roughly the same Lie algebras. There are certain small divergences , however. Firstly, for associative
algebrasand structurable algebrasassociatedto hermitian forms , it will proveuseful to embed these
in bigger structurable algebras of the same type if 1 /2/∈Φ. Secondly, we will not consider Smirnov
algebras if 1 /2/∈Φ.
5.1 (Quadratic) Jordan algebras
Consider a quadratic Jordan algebra ( J,Q). SetG=J×0,Qgrp=Q= (Q,0), andT= 0. We
also setPxy=QxQyx. We remark that Gis proper by Lemma 1.17.
Now, we show that this forms an operator Kantor system. First, o bserve that ( sx,ty) is quasi-
invertible in J[[s,t]] forx,y∈Jsince the Bergmannoperator B(sx,ty) is invertible [19, Proposition
3.2],andthatquasiinverses( sx)ty,(ty)sxaredeterminedbythesymmetryprinciple[19, Proposition
3.3]:
(sx)ty=sx+s2Qx(ty)sx,(ty)sx=ty+t2Qy(sx)ty.
Loos [20, Theorem 1.4] proved that
exp(sx)exp(ty) = exp(ty)sxβ(sx,ty)exp(sx)ty,
holds in the TKK representation. We conclude that
o2i+1,2i(x,y) = exp((QxQy)ix), o2i+2,2i+1(x,y) = exp((QxQy)iQxy), oi,j(x,y) = 1 if|i−j|>1
46hold in the TKKrepresentation. Theorem3.28showsthat ( G,Qgrp,T,P)forms anoperatorKantor
system.
5.2 Associative algebras
LetAbe an associative algebra with involution over Φ. If 1 /2/∈Φ, we setB=A⊗Φ[s]/(s2−s)
with involution determined by a⊗s/ma√sto→¯a⊗(1−s). If 1/2∈Φ we also use Bto denoteA.
The algebra Binduces an operator Kantor system of the form of Example 3.4, usin g (a,b)/ma√sto→a¯b
as the hermitian form. The vector group is given by
GB={(a,b)∈B×B|b+¯b=a¯a}.
This vector group is proper, since ( GB)2={a⊗s−¯a⊗(1−s)}so that Lie( G)⊗K∼=Lie(ˆGK),
which is suﬃcient by Lemma 1.17 for Gto be proper. The operators are
1.Q(a,b)c=−a¯ca+bc,
2.T(a,b)c=a¯c¯b−bc¯a,
3.P(a,b)(c,d) =a¯ca¯ca−a¯cbc−bda,
4.R(a,b)(c,d) =bd¯b+a¯cb¯ca−a¯ca¯cb.
The reason we chose to extend Aif 1/2/∈Φ, is to guaranteethat condition (3.2) of the deﬁnition
of a pre-Kantor pair holds (or its equivalent formulation in Example 3.4 ), i.e.,
x−¯x∈[GB,GB]
holds for all x∈B. This condition holds in the extension, since
[(x,x¯xs),(1,s)] = (0,x−¯x),
for allx∈B.
Remark 5.1. In order to obtain formulas compatible with the operators of followin g sections, one
must apply the automorphism (( a,b)/ma√sto→(−a,b),(c,d)/ma√sto→(−c,d)) to this operator Kantor system.
5.3 Structurable algebras associated to hermitian forms
Consider an associative algebra Cwith involution c/ma√sto→¯cand a right C-moduleMwith (right-)
hermitian form h:M×M−→C,i.e., it is the same as a left-hermitian form except that Mis a
rightC-module and hshould satisfy h(a,bc) =h(a,b)cforc∈C,a,b∈M. SetA=C×Mwith
operation
(a,m)(b,n) = (ab+h(n,m),na+m¯b)
and involution
(a,m) = (¯a,m).
This algebra is isomorphic to the structurable algebra associated to a hermitian form constructed
by Allison [1, 8.iii], by still using has the (now left) hermitian form with Mconsidered as a left
module under a·m=m¯a.When we speak of Cas a leftAmodule, we consider Mwith this second
47module structure (and Awith the obvious structure). The reason we work with the right her mitian
description, is that there appear less involutions in computations.
We shall consider
GA={((c,m),(d,mc))∈A×A|d+¯d=c¯c+h(m,m)}.
Weassumethat GAsatisﬁescondition(3.2), i.e., x−¯x∈[GA,GA]forallx∈A, andthatGisproper.
As for associative algebras, we can assume that both statements hold forAorA⊗Φ[s]/(s2−s)
with ¯s= 1−s(withms= ¯smfor allm∈M).
We shall construct all the operators by making use of a represent ation. This approach also
establishes that Acorresponds to a 3-special Kantor pair in the sense of [6, section 6]. Deﬁne
h±:A×A−→C: ((a,m),(b,n))/ma√sto→a¯b±h(m,n).
These are (left-)hermitian maps if we consider Aas a leftC-module. We let M2(C) act onA2×1
using/parenleftbigga b
c d/parenrightbigg
·/parenleftbigg(e,f)
(g,h)/parenrightbigg
=/parenleftbigg(ae+bg,af−bh)
(ce+dg,−cf+dh)/parenrightbigg
,
i.e., we act normally on C2×1⊂A2×1and as
/parenleftbigg
a−b
−c d/parenrightbigg
onM2×1. We write b·ǫ(g,h) for (bg,−bh). So,
f:A2×1⊗A1×2−→M2(C) :/parenleftbigg
a
b/parenrightbigg
⊗/parenleftbigc d/parenrightbig
/ma√sto−→/parenleftbigg
h+(a,c)h−(a,d)
h−(b,c)h+(b,d)/parenrightbigg
is anM2(C)-bimodule map if we let M2(C) act on the right on A1×2usingx·M= (M∗·x∗)∗with
thea∗the hermitian transpose of a, since
h−(c·ǫa,b) =ch+(a,b), ch−(a,b) =h+(c·ǫa,b),
for alla,b∈A,c∈C. Set
E={(a,b)∈End(A2×1)×End(A1×2)|f(a(x),y) =f(x,b(y))}.
Deﬁne
g:A1×2⊗M2(C)A2×1−→ E
as
g(x⊗y)(z) =/braceleftigg
xf(y,z)z∈A1,2
f(z,x)y z∈A2,1.
It is not hard to check that gis a well deﬁned E-bimodule map. This proves that
(M2(C)⊕E)⊕(A2×1⊕A1×2),
48forms an associative algebra if all undeﬁned multiplications are seen a s 0. Using this deﬁnition, we
can interpret elements as matrices in
C A C
AEA
C A C
,
with the obvious embeddings of subspaces.
We have two representations of the associated vector group, na mely
((a,m),(u,ma))/ma√sto→
1 (a,m)−u+h(m,m)
0 1 ( −a,−m)
0 0 1

and
((a,m),(u,ma))/ma√sto→
1 0 0
(−a,−m) 1 0
−u+h(m,m) (a,m) 1
.
Givenanelement g= ((a,m),(u,ma)), wewrite ˜ utorepresent u−h(m,m)inoperatorsinvolving
g. This representation yields us operators
1.Q(x,y)b=h+(x,b)·x−˜y·ǫb,
2.T(x,y)b=h−(˜y·ǫb,x)−h−(x,˜y·ǫb),
3.P(x,y)(u,v) =h+(x,u)·Q(x,y)u−˜y˜v·x,
4.˜R(x,y)(u,v) = ˜u˜v˜u−h+(x,b)T(x,y)u,
with (Qxy,˜Rxy) the image of Qgrp
xyunder (a,b)/ma√sto→(a,˜b). So, we see that these operators form an
operator Kantor pair on the structurable algebra A, using Theorem 3.28. It is not hard to compute
that
(x¯y)x−uy=Q(x,u)y
holds for (x,u)∈GAandy∈A, so that
(x¯y)z+(z¯y)x−(z¯x)y=Q(1,1)
z,xy.
Hence, the constructed operator Kantor pair corresponds pre cisely to the structurable algebra.
We remark that this construction works more generally for M1×M2withMileftC-modules
with hermitian forms hi. This corresponds to the Kantor triple system
Vx,y(z) =h+(x,y)·z+h+(z,y)·x−h−(z,x)·ǫy,
withh±=h1±h2. Using as underlying vector group
G={(a,b)∈(M1×M2)×C|b+¯b=h−(a,a),b−¯b∈ /an}bracketle{th−(x,y)−h−(y,x)|x,y∈M1×M2/an}bracketri}ht}
contained in ( M1×M2)×Cwithψ=h−, we get an operator Kantor pair if 1 /2∈Φ. If 1/2/∈Φ
we need to make the extra assumptions that
/an}bracketle{th−(x,y)−h−(y,x)|x,y∈M1×M2/an}bracketri}ht= [G,G]
and thatGis proper.
495.4 Constructing operator structurable algebras using Z-substructures
We want to construct subsystems over Zfrom some operator Kantor systems over Q. We want to
do this speciﬁcally for systems associated to structurable algebra s. In this setting, the associated
operator Kantor system over Qmeans the operator Kantor pair associated to the 5-graded Lie
algebra [2, section 3] corresponding to the structurable algebra o verQ.
The advantage of these Z-subsystems is that we do not need to check the axioms of operato r
Kantor pairs, but only need to check that the operators are inter nal. Remark 3.24 shows that if
PandRexist for an operator Kantor pair, then they are unique. In this se ction, we start by ﬁrst
constructing PandRas homogeneous maps from Q,TandV. After this construction, it becomes
suﬃcient to construct the primary operators QandTto construct all operators. Later we will
construct Z-analogues for diﬀerent classes of structurable algebras. With th ose analogues we will
be able to construct operator Kantor pairs for all classes of cent ral simple structurable algebras
(except Smirnov algebras if 1 /2/∈Φ).
We consider an algebra Cwith involution a/ma√sto→¯a. Consider ψ:C×C−→C,(a,b)/ma√sto→a¯b. This
endows
GC={(a,b)∈C×C|b+¯b=a¯a},
with a vector group structure. We will be interested in deﬁning an op erator Kantor pair structure
with operator
Q(a,b)(c,d) = (a¯c)a−bc.
We assume that
Lie(GC) =C×(GC)2,
i.e., for each a∈Cthere exists bsuch thatb+¯b=a¯a. The (GC)2appearing in this assumption
does not impose anything as proved in Lemma 1.7. We set S= (GC)2. Note that x−¯x∈S
for allx∈Cand that 2S={s−¯s|s∈S}sinces=−¯sfor alls∈S. So, the assumption that
Lie(GC) =C×(GC)2guaranteesthat conditions (3.2), (3.3) for pre-Kantorpairs alwa ys hold. This
assumption is only important if 1 /2/∈Φ and will, for us, only play a role in structurable algebras
that can have an arbitrary associative part.
We want to prove that there exists at most one operator Kantor s ystem with
Q(a,b)(c,d) = (a¯c)a−bc,
and a given operator T:GC×C−→ {x−¯x|x∈C}={[a,b] =a¯b−b¯a|a,b∈C}of bidegree
[3,1]. We remark that we will use Vandτwithout making reference to the operator Kantor pair
structure on which they are deﬁned. In that case, we use operat ors
Vx,yg= (−Q(1,1)
g,xy,−T(2,1)
g,xy−ψ(Q(1,1)
g,xy,g))
and
τy,xg= (P(1,2)
g,x−1y−1,R(2,2)
g,x−1y−1+ψ(P(2,1)
g,x−1y,g)−ψ(Qgy,Qx−1y)),
i.e, we identify the operator Kantor Vwith its restriction to C+×C−−→Nat(G+) andτto its
restrictionG−×G+−→Nat(G+). There is an incongruity in the order of arguments with the
purpose of making Vcorrespond to the usual Vfor structurable algebras, while still taking the
version ofτthat is not only the most easy to deﬁne, but also the only one which we will need in
this section.
50Lemma 5.2. LetCbe a unital algebra with involution and consider a (proper) v ector group G≤GC
withLie(G) =C×Sfor someS. DeﬁneQ(a,u)b= (a¯b)a−ub. Suppose that there exist operators
T,P,Rsuch that (G,Qgrp,T,P)forms an operator Kantor system. Use (Vx,y)ito denote the action
ofVon thei-graded parts of Lie (GC). The operators P,Rare uniquely determined by Q,T, as
indicated by the following formulas, in which x= (a,b), andg,h∈G:
1.Pg(x(−x)) =Tg(b)−(Tg1)b−(Vg,1)1Qgb+(Vg,b)1Qg1,
2.(τh,g(−g)g)1=−Qg(−g)Qhg+Vg,hQg(−g)h,
3.Pgh=−Pg(h(−h))−QgQhg−τh,g(−g)g+2QTghh−(Vg,h)1Qgh,
4.(τh,Tg−11g)1= [QTg−11,Qh−1g]−Q[g,QTg−11h]h,
5.Rgh= (Qgh)2−Pg(T(2,1)
h,1g)−QgQhQg−11+(τhTg−11g)1+(Vg,h)1Tgh.
Moreover, if there is no 3torsion, then Tis uniquely determined by
3(Tgh−[g,Qgh]) = 2((g¯h)g)¯g−2g(¯g(h¯g))−((g¯g)h)¯g+g(¯h(g¯g)).
Remark 5.3. Substituting equations 1 and 2 in equation 3 of the lemma yields that Pg(a,b) must
equal to
−Tg(b)+(Tg1)b+(Vg,1)Qgb−(Vg,b)Qg1−QgQ(a,b)g−Qg(−g)Q(−a,¯b)g+Vg,aQg(−g)a+2QTgaa−(Vg,a)1Qga,
which is a homogeneous map of bidegree [3 ,2] ingand (a,b). Similarly, substituting equation 4 in
equation 5 yields us a deﬁnition of Rghas a homogeneous map of bidegree [4 ,2] in terms of V,Q,
TandP.
Proof.We work with the Lie algebra Lassociated to an operator Kantor pair, and prove that these
equalities hold.
We know that x(−x) = (0,2b−a¯a) = (0,b−¯b) = [b,1] forx= (a,b). The ﬁrst equation is
obtained by evaluating
adg3([b,1]) =ν3,2(g,x(−x)),
on the grading element ζofL. Namely, using that exp( g) is necessarily an automorphism so that
adg3([b,1])·ζ= ([Tgb,1]+[b,Tg1]+[Qgb,Vg,1]+[Vg,b,Qg1])·ζ= [Tgb,1]+[b,Tg1]+[Qgb,Vg,1]+[Vg,b,Qg1],
and that
ν3,2(x,y) = adPxy,
we obtain the ﬁrst equation. The second equation is obtained from
(τa,bc)1=−P(1,2)
c,ba−1=−P(2,1)
b,ca−1=−QbQac+Vc,aQba
which holds if b∈G2, by ﬁrst applying the deﬁnition of τ, using that f(2,1)
b,a=f(1,2)
a,bifb∈G2for
allfhomogeneous of degree 3, and the expression of P(2,1)for pre-Kantor pairs.
The third equation follows from evaluating
ν3,2(g,h) =µ3,2(g,h)−h1µ3,1(g,h)−µ1,1(g,h)µ2,1(g,h)
51on the grading element ζ. The last equation follows from evaluating
ν4,2(g,h) =µ4,2(g,h)−µ1,1(g,h)µ3,1(g,h),
on the 1 contained in the −1-graded copy of CinL. Namely, we know that
(ν4,2(g,h)+µ1,1(g,h)µ3,1(g,h))·1 = (Qgh)2−Rgh+(Vg,h)2Tgh,
while we also know that
(g3h2g−1
1+g2h2g−1
2+g1h2g−1
3)·1 =Pg/parenleftig
T2,1
(h,1)g/parenrightig
+QgQhQg−11−τh,Tg−11g
since
g3h2g−1
1·1 =g3(h2·V1,g) =Pg(T(2,1)
(h,1)g).
The fourth equation follows from evaluating the equation
(g1h2g−1
3+h−1
2g1g−1
3−h1g1h1g−1
3−(Qh−1g)1g−1
3) = 0,
on the−1-graded 1. This last equation holds since
µ2,1(h−1,g) = (Qh−1g)1.
Note that equations 1 ,2 and 4 uniquely determine their left-hand sides, since these only use
Q,TandV(withVitself also being deﬁned in terms of QandT). Now, we see that the third
equation, uniquely determines Pgh. Now that Pis deﬁned, we see that the last equation determines
Rghuniquely as well.
We use Equation (1.1) to obtain
3Tg−3T(1,2)
g,g=−T(1,1,1)
g,g,g,
asTmust be homogeneous of degree 3 in g. Using that T(1,2)
g,gh= [g,Qgh] and evaluating the
(1,1)-linearisation T(1,1,1)
g,g,ghyields the expression for Tgiven in the statement of this lemma, since
−T(1,1,1)
g,g,gh=−[g,Q(1,1)
g,gh] =−[g,2(g¯h)g−(g¯g)h] =−g(2(g¯h)g−(g¯g)h)+(2(g¯h)g−(g¯g)h)¯g.
Remark 5.4. The previous lemma is not that useful if 1 /2∈Φ, since the operators are then
uniquely deﬁned by
2Pgh=P(3,(1,1))
g(h,h)+P(3,(1,1))
g(h2,1)−P(3,(1,1))
g(1,h2),
and
2Rgh=R(4,(1,1))
g(h,h)+R(4,(1,1))
g(h2,1)−R(4,(1,1))
g(1,h2),
using the known linearisations of these operators.

so that
q(a)+q(a) =a¯a.
This mapqis clearly quadratic. Set
GA={(a,s+q(a))∈A×A|s∈(1⊗SO2+SO1⊗1)∪ {x−¯x|x∈O1⊗O2}},
withSOi={x∈Oi|x⊥1,ti}. This means that G2contains all x−¯xand all 1 ⊗s1+s2⊗1 with
si⊥1,ti, i.e., all elements that could reasonably be called skew. These Gare clearly proper.
We want to prove that there exists an operator Kantor system as sociated with GAand
Q(a,b)h= (a¯h)a−bh.
We do this by considering universal variants of O1,O2and we will still refer to these variants
asO1,O2. Consider R=Z[a,b,c,d,e,f ]. SetO1=CD(R[t1]/(t2
1−t1+a),b,c) with which we
mean the algebra obtained by applying the Cayley-Dickson process 2 times using the parameters
b,cstarting from R[t]/(t2−t+a). Similarly, we set O2=CD(R[t2]/(t2
2−t2+d),e,f). Note that
Oiis a subalgebra of an octonion algebra PioverQ(a,b,c,d,e,f ).
We want to prove that A=O1⊗O2≤P1⊗P2induces an operator Kantor system. So, we use
the similarly deﬁned GAoverZand note that this group is proper as well. We ﬁrst check whether
Trestricts to A. We know that Tgh∈Aforh∈Aandgof the form ( o1⊗o2,u) by using the
alternativity of the multiplication for octonion algebras and the expr ession forTproved in Lemma
5.2. More precisely, for these elements we can compute that
T(a⊗b,u)c= [a⊗b,−uc] =−(a⊗b)(¯c¯u)+(uc)(¯a⊗¯b).
Moreover, the linearisations of Trestrict nicely to Asince they satisfy T(1,2)
x,gy= [x,Qgy] and
T(2,1)
x,g=T(1,2)
g,x+T(1,2)

GA×GA−→[GA,GA]⊂(GA)2.
So, the operators Q,Prestrict to maps from GA×GAtoA. Observe that

We also note that (1 ⊗S2+S1⊗1)⊗Q∩A= (1⊗S2+S1⊗1). Using that
x−¯x∈(1⊗S2⊕S1⊗1⊕(1−2t1)Φ⊗1+1⊗Φ(1−2t2))⊗Q

thatQgrprestricts to GA. This proves that all operators restrict nicely to GA.
Now,consider GA(g)(GA(k[a,b,c,d,e,f ]))forg:k[a,b,c,d,e,f ]−→kcorrespondingtoactually
considering octonion algebras O1,O2obtained by a Cayley Dickson process over a ﬁeld k. This
induces an operator Kantor pair structure associated to the ten sor product of octonion algebras.
For general composition algebras, we only need to consider subsys tems of the just constructed
operator Kantor pair.
5.4.2 Smirnov algebras
Allison and Faulkner generalized the Smirnov algebra already to arbitr ary rings [5, example 6.7]
combined with [4] in a setting suitable for the study of Lie algebras (bu t not 5-graded Lie algebras).
We show that if 1 /2∈Φ, then there is an operator Kantor system that yields the same Lie algebra.
Consider an octonion algebra Owith normN. The Smirnov algebra is a quotient of the subal-
gebraBofO⊗Ogenerated by o⊗oforo∈Oby an ideal Iof hermitian elements. The ideal I
corresponds to the scalar multiplications on Ounder the embedding
B−→End(O) :c⊗c/ma√sto→(x/ma√sto→N(c,x)c).

We setA=B/I. We can take the ﬁxed elements under the exchange involution of th e operator
Kantor system associated to the tensor product of composition a lgebras. This yields an operator
Kantor system associated to Bif 1/2∈Φ. It is not hard to check that all operators are compatible
with the quotient with respect to I, as they are formed by multiplications, involutions and the
operatorT. For the operator Tthis follows from the formula for Tand the linearizations of T, if
there is no 3-torsion. It also holds in general, as can be proved using the model of O⊗O, now over
Z[1/2], from the previous subsection.
Remark 5.5. If 1/2/∈Φ, it is better let the unit go. Let Obe the split octonion algebra over Z.
If necessary we represent elements as Zorn matrices. Consider
A={x∈ /an}bracketle{to⊗o|o∈O/an}bracketri}ht:n(x) = 0},
withn(o⊗o) =o¯o=N(o), which is a nonunital algebra. Let GAbe the subgroup of A×A

proving that GAis a vector group. This immediately shows that G2⊗K=ˆG2(K) and thus that

5.4.3 Structurable algebras of skew-dimension 1
Consider a hermitian cubic norm structure ( J,N,T,♯, ×,e), as described for example by the second
author [12, Deﬁnition 4.1]9, over a quadratic ´ etale extension A=E= Φ[t]/(t2−t+α) of Φ, for
someα∈Φ, and associated algebra E×Jwith operation
(a,b)(c,d) = (ac+T(b,d),ad+¯cb+b×d)
and involution
(a,c)/ma√sto→(¯a,c).
Over ﬁelds of characteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3 each structura ble algebra of skew dimension 1,
i.e., a structurable algebra such that the space {x|x+ ¯x= 0}is 1-dimensional, can be described
in such a way as proved in [12, Theorem 5.14]10. Recall that an arbitrary cubic norm structure
(J,N,T,♯, ×,e) overFinduces a hermitian cubic norm structure ( J⊕J,N′,T′,♯′,×′,e′) uniquely
determined by N′(a,b) = (N(a),N(b)),T′((a,b),(c,d)) = (T(a,d),T(b,c)),(a,b)♯′= (b♯,a♯) [12,
Example 3.10]. We call this hermitian cubic norm structure a split hermitian cubic norm structure .
We consider the vector group
GA={((a,b),((u,b♯+ab))∈(E×J)2|u+ ¯u=a¯a+T(b,b)}.
This vector group is proper, since ( GA)2=/an}bracketle{tt−¯t|t∈E/an}bracketri}ht. Remark that u,vsatisfyu+ ¯u=v+¯v=
a¯a+T(b,b) if and only if ( u−v)+(u−v) = 0. If we work over a ﬁeld Φ the space of x∈Esuch
thatx+ ¯x= 0 coincides with the span of all y−¯ysince both spaces are 1 dimensional and contain
t−¯t/ne}ationslash= 0. One can compute, see Appendix B.2, that
T((a,j),(u,j♯+aj))(b,k) = [(u−T(j,j))(b¯a)+(u−a¯a)T(k,j)−T(ak,j♯)+bN(j)+T(j♯×k,j),1],
using [a,1] =a−¯a, if one works over a ring Φ without 3-torsion.
Now, weprovetheanalogonof[12, Theorem5.14]inoursetting, inwh ichcertainformsofmatrix
structurable algebras are related to hermitian cubic norm structu res over ﬁelds of characteristic
diﬀerent from 2 and 3.
Lemma 5.6. Suppose that Ais an algebra over a ﬁeld Φfor which there exist a quadratic extension
K/Φsuch that (1) A⊗Kforms a matrix structurable algebra, i.e., A⊗Kcan be constructed
from a split hermitian cubic norm structure over K, (2) there exists a vector group GAsuch that
(GA)K∼=GA⊗K. ThenAis an algebra constructed from a hermitian cubic norm struct ure.
9We will not explicitly use the additional axioms of [12, Rema rk 4.4] that are required for ﬁelds of characteristic
2 or 3. These will still implicitly play a role, however, in co nstraining the classes of hermitian cubic norm structures
that we will consider.
10This theorem says that speciﬁc forms of matrix structurable algebras can be described as hermitian cubic norm
structures. These speciﬁc forms are all skew-dimension 1-s tructurable algebras [3, Theorem 1.13].
55Proof.We will try to reconstruct all operators uniquely from the assumpt ions we made in the
lemma. All axioms for hermitian cubic norm structures will hold, since w e are considering a
substructure, since GA(Φ)⊂GA(K) for all Φ-algebras K, of a split hermitian cubic norm structure
for which these axioms necessarily hold.
Considerαsuchthat (1 ,α)∈GA(Φ)⊂GA(K)andlett=Q(1,α)1. We canassumethat t/ne}ationslash= 1/2.
We setEto be the submodule of Agenerated by tand¯t= 1−t. We observe that E⊗K∼=K⊕K
(as an algebra) since /an}bracketle{tQ(1,α)1∈A⊗K|(1,α)∈G(K)/an}bracketri}ht=K⊕K, so thatt2−t=−a∈Φ and
E∼=Φ[t]/(t2−t+a). We put
J=/an}bracketle{tj∈A|ej=j¯e,∀e∈E/an}bracketri}ht.
We know that AK∼=EK⊕JK. So, forb∈A, we writeb=ek+jkand compute tb−b¯t=ek(t−¯t).
We obtain that ( tb−b¯t)(t−¯t) =ek(1−4a)∈Φ×eksince 4a/ne}ationslash= 1 (4a= 1 implies that a= 1/4,
t= 1/2,t−¯t= 0). We see that ek∈Eandjk∈Jand thusA=J⊕E. TheE-module structure
ofJis given by left multiplication in A.
We immediately obtain the existence of ♯restricted from JK−→JKusing the second assump-
tion. We remark that ♯deﬁnes all operations uniquely. Firstly, ×is just the linearization of ♯.
Secondly, if Eis a ﬁeld, then Nis uniquely deﬁned from N(a)a= (a♯)♯. If it is not a ﬁeld, then
there exists an idempotent e∈Esuch thatE= Φe⊕Φ(1−e). In that case, N(a)e,N(a)(1−e)
are uniquely deﬁned from evaluating Nonea,(1−e)a. Namely, eJand (1−e)Jare Φ vector
spaces, Φ ∼=eΦ⊂Eacts on the former by scalar multiplication and acts trivially on the latt er
while (1 −e)Φ acts only nontrivially on the latter, so eN(a),(1−e)N(a) are easily recovered if
ea,(1−e)a/ne}ationslash= 0. Ifea= 0, however, then we know that eN(a) =N(ea) = 0.
Lastly, we can recover TusingT(a,b) =ab−a×b.
Using similar observations as for the tensor product of composition algebras, one can prove
that (G,Q,T,P,R ) forms an operator Kantor system for certain classes of hermitia n cubic norm
structures.
Namely, over ﬁelds Φ a non degenerate (split hermitian) cubic norm st ructure is either of the
form Φ⊕J(Q,1) for some quadratic form with basepoint 1, H3(C,γ) for a composition algebra C,
or it is anisotropic [23, Theorem 4.1.59]. In the ﬁrst two cases, [24, ex ample 2.2 and 2.3] provide
versions of cubic norm structures deﬁned over arbitrary rings of scalars, which one can use to
prove that the split hermitian cubic norm structures correspondin g to isotropic cubic norms induce
operator kantor pairs associated to the skew dimension 1 algebras over arbitrary ﬁelds.
For anisotropic cubic norm structures, one can also sometimes con struct variants over arbitrary
rings. For example, any ring Φ forms a cubic norm structure over its elf with
N(x) =x3, T(x,y) = 3xy, x♯=x2.
In particular, Z[ti|i∈I]⊂Q(ti|i∈I) forms such a cubic norm structure and thus induces an
operator Kantor pair for all I. The split hermitian cubic norm structure related to an inseparable
ﬁeld extension E/Fof degree 3 is a substructure of the split hermitian cubic norm struc ture related
toE, which is an operator Kantor pair as it is the quotient of the operato r Kantor pair induced by
Z[ti|i∈E] (we should pass via E[ti|i∈E] in order to obtain an operator Kantor pair over E). For
the other classes of anisotropic cubic norm structures, which can be denoted as 27/F, 27K/F, 9/F,
9K/F, and 3/F using the notation of [28, Section 15] and [28, Theore m 17.6], it is easier to identify
them with anisotropic substructures of isotropic structures, so that we work with cubic norms on
split Albert algebras (27(K)/F), 3 ×3 hermitian matrices over Φ[ t]/(t2−t) (9(K)/F), or Φ ⊕Φ⊕Φ
(3/F).
565.5 Structurable algebras as operator Kantor pairs with uni t
Now, we will propose a deﬁnition of structurable operator Kantor p airs. First, we mention two
results in the literature from which we took our inspiration. Thereaf ter we state the deﬁnition and
see that it ﬁts the examples of structurable algebras we construc ted earlier in this section. There
are two exceptions, however, if 1 /2/∈Φ. Namely, the Smirnov algebras since we threw away the
unit in our construction and the quadratic Jordan algebras since th e skew elements start to play
a role in characteristic 2. For structurable operator Kantor pairs , we will be able to see G+
2as
skew elements with respect to a certain involution and be able to prov e that there exists a certain
ﬁltration of the associated Lie algebra.
Allison [2, Theorem 4] reconstructed a structurable algebra from a 5-graded Lie algebra that
decomposes in a certain way with respect to a certain sl2subalgebra. This subalgebracan, after the
reconstruction of the structurable algebra, be seen as being gen erated by the units of the distinct
copies of the structurable algebra.
Later, Allison and Faulkner [6, Corollary 15] saw that a structurable algebra over a ring Φ
containing1 /6isnothingmoreandnothinglessthanaKantorpairoverthesamerin gcontaininga1-
invertibleelementexp( x) forxcontainedintheKantorpair(see[6]forthedeﬁnitionofa1-invert ible
element). Furthermore, in their setting they saw that xbeing 1-invertible is the same as asking it
to be conjugate invertible, i.e., asking that there exists an ysuch that ( Vx,y,Vy,x) = (2Id,−2Id).
The logical choice for x, if one looks at the Kantor pair obtained from a structurable algebr a, is 1.
The corresponding yis 2, sinceV1,1a=a. Furthermore, xbeing 1-invertible with corresponding y
requires that
τx,y= exp−(y)exp+(x)exp−(y)
reversesthegradingoftheLiealgebra LassociatedtotheKantorpair. This τx,yisanautomorphism
withτ1,2(a+) = 2a−forain the structurable algebra. Unsurprisingly, annoying factors 2 pla y an
important role here.
Deﬁnition 5.7. We call an operator Kantor pair ( G+,G−)structurable if there exist x∈G+/G+
2
andy∈G−/G−
2such that
(a)τ= exp(v)exp(u)exp(v) induces a bijection G−−→G+under the conjugation11action for
u= (√
2x,ψ(x,x))∈G+(Φ[√
2]) andv= (√
2y,ψ(y,y))∈G−(Φ[√
2]) ,
(b)Vx,yis equal to the grading derivation ζ.
Remark 5.8. One can check that Quy=xand thatyis the unique element for which this is the
case. Moreover, τ(y) =xandτ(x) =yso thatτ= exp(u)exp(v)exp(u) as well.
Remark 5.9. Over ﬁelds of characteristic 2, the deﬁnition of a structurable ope rator Kantor pair
implies that there exist xandysuch thatx[2]= (0,ψ(x,x)) andy[2]= (0,ψ(y,y)) induce a bijection
τ= exp(y[2])exp(x[2])exp(y[2]) :G−−→G+, since we can use a map√
2/ma√sto→0. One can also check
that this condition, combined with Vx,y= 1, is suﬃcient as well. This indicates that the deﬁnition
can only work for operator Kantor pairs such that G±
2/ne}ationslash= 0 if one works over a ﬁeld of characteristic
2. Hence, quadratic Jordan algebras will not be considered struct urable over ﬁelds of characteristic
2.
11If 1/6∈Φ this is the same as asking that τreverses the grading of the Lie algebra, i.e., that xis 1-invertible.
However, if 1 /6/∈Φ, we prefer the more restrictive version we ask here.
57So, we can think of the deﬁnition of being structurable as a reasona ble way to combine
•if 1/2∈Φ, there exists a 1-invertible xin the Kantor pair part (such that the corresponding
τinduces a bijection G+−→G−),
•if Φ is a ﬁeld of characteristic2, there exists an xfor whichQgrp
x[2]is invertible12andVx,Q−1
x[2]x=
ζ,
into a single deﬁnition. Now, we explain how the x= 1 =yis a natural choice for the previously
considered examples of structurable algebras, excluding the quad ratic Jordan algebras. We also
ignore the Smirnov algebras, since our construction of the associa ted operator Kantor pair throws
the unit away.
Remark 5.10. If we usex= 1 andy= 1 for any of the examples of structurable algebrasdiscussed
earlier in this section, we can guarantee that the conjugation actio nτ:G−−→G+is given by
(a,b)/ma√sto→(a,b) instead of the τ1(a,b) = (2a,4b) we discussed before. More precisely, ( λ·1,µ·1) is
1-invertible in the setting of Allison and Faulkner if and only if λµ= 2. Each
τλ,µ= exp−(µ)exp+(λ)exp−(µ)
has as action
τλ,µ(a,b)+= (λ2/2·a,λ4/4·b)−, τλ,µ(a,b)−= (µ2/2·a,µ4/4·b)+.
This makes ( λ,µ) = (√
2,√
2) a natural choice.
Remark 5.11. One can show that Vu,v= 2ζfor allu,vwithu−1=−uandv−1=−vsuch that
exp−(v)exp+(u)exp−(v)
reverses the grading. So, involving√
2 in the deﬁnition is only relevant if 1 /2/∈Φ. Hence, if
1/2∈Φ, the deﬁnition simply reduces to requiring the existence of a 1-inve rtiblex(with a nicely
behavedτassociated to it if 1 /3/∈Φ).
Besides the fact that the deﬁnition of being structurable ﬁts the t ypical examples, it also guar-
antees the existence of an involution such that G+
2can be seen as skew elements.
Lemma 5.12. Suppose that the operator Kantor pair (G+,G−)is structurable with corresponding
x∈G+/G+
2andy∈G−/G−
2, then there exists an involution a/ma√sto→¯a=a−[y,[x,a]]. Moreover,
G+
2−→G+/G+
2:s/ma√sto→[s,y] =Qsyis injective with Qsy=−Qsy.
Proof.A direct computation shows that ¯¯a=afor allausing that [ x,[y,[x,a]]] = 2[x,a] since
Vx,y=ζ. We remark that [ s,y] = 0 implies that [ x,[y,s]] = 0 so that 2 s= 0. If [s,y] = 0, we know
fora∈G+/G+
2that
[s,τ−1a] = [s,[y,[y,a]]+√
2[Pv,[x,a]]] = [s,[y,[y,a]]+2[y,[y,[y,[x,a]]]]] = [s,[y,[y,a]]] = 0,
using 2s= 0 to expand Pv[x,a] as√
2[y,[y,[y,[x,a]]]]. This shows that Qs= 0 whenever [ s,y] = 0,
which implies that s= 0. Finally, we compute
Qsy= [s,y]−[y,[x,[s,y]]] = [s,y]+2[y,s] =−[s,y] =−Qsy.
12We will not prove the equivalence between what we stated here and what we expressed before. But one can
check that τ:G−−→G+is given by = Qgrp
x[2].
58Lastly, we remark that being structurable yields a generalization of the characterizing decom-
position employed in [2, Theorem 4]. To obtain this generalization, we ﬁr st need certain building
blocks. After that we prove a proposition generalizing the decompo sition. Thereafter, we explain
in Remark 5.15 in what sense this is a generalization.
LetV1betherank1moduleoverΦonwhichexp( u), exp(v), adxandadyacttrivially. Set V3to
be the module /an}bracketle{tw,[y,w],[y,[y,w]]/an}bracketri}htΦwhich is free of rank 3 over Φ and let [ x,w] = 0,[x,[y,w]] =w,
and [x,[y,[y,w]]] = [y,w]. Note that exp( u) and exp(v) act onV3as well. Finally, we deﬁne V5as
the free rank 5 module
/an}bracketle{ts,[y,s],[y,[y,s]],s3,s4/an}bracketri}ht
This has actions of exp( v) and ad(y) using that
exp(v)·s=s+√
2[y,s]+[y,[y,s]]+√
2s3+s4,
so that [y,[y,[y,s]]] = 3s3and [y,s3] = 4s4. To determine the action of exp( u) and ad(x) we can
use thatτ= exp(v)exp(u)exp(v) acts on the generating set by reversing the order of the element s.
Remark 5.13. The exp(u), adxand similar maps we used in the deﬁnition of the Vicannot
simply be identiﬁed with the similar elements contained in the endomorph ism algebra of the Lie
algebra. For example, φ·adxmight be zero for nonzero φ∈Φ. The point is that we will be able
to recognize quotients of these Viin the Lie algebra and that taking this quotient preserves these
maps.
Proposition 5.14. Suppose that (G+,G−)is a structurable operator Kantor pair with correspond-
ingxandy. There exists a ﬁltration 0⊂U1⊂U2⊂L=L(G+,G−)of subspaces of the as-
sociated Lie algebra closed under exp(u),exp(v),[x,·]and[y,·]and there exist spaces S=G+
2,
H= (G+/G+
2)/(QSy), andD=L0//an}bracketle{tVt,y|t∈G+/an}bracketri}ht, such that
L/U2∼=V1⊗ΦD, U 2/U1∼=V3⊗ΦH,andU1∼=V5⊗ΦS.
Proof.Fors∈G+
2we deﬁne a submodule
Ms=/an}bracketle{tτ−1(s),τ−1Qsy,VQsy,y,Qsy,s/an}bracketri}ht ⊂L(G+,G−)
corresponding to the image of V5⊗s. We remark that each of these generators is nonzero if and
only ifsis nonzero by Lemma 5.12 and [ x,y] =Vx,y. So, this shows that U1=MG+
2∼=V5⊗ΦS.
ForU2we take the whole Lie algebra, where we replace the 0-graded part b y/an}bracketle{tVt,y|t∈G+/an}bracketri}ht.
This immediately shows that L/U2∼=V1⊗ΦD. Lastly, we observe that in U2/U1we are looking
at elements tinL1/(QSy). For such a t, we obtain τ−1(t),[t,y] andtas the logical generators
corresponding to the image of V3⊗t. It is easy to check that τ−1(t) = [y,[y,t]] mod [x,G−
2] so
that these generators are well deﬁned for tmodU2contained in L1and that these generators are
0 if and only if tis zero.
Remark 5.15. In [2, Theorem 4] the requirement was that L∼=S⊗V5⊕H⊗V3⊕Dwith
respect to ad xand ady. The direct sum is, however, too strong to be obtainable if 1 /2/∈Φ.
On the other hand, if 1 /6∈Φ, we can fully recover the direct sum of [2, Theorem 4]. Namely,
letH⊕Sbe the eigenspaces of x/ma√sto→¯xinL1with eigenvalues ±1. We can identify U2/U1with
[y,[y,H]]⊕[y,H]⊕H⊂L. Moreover,we can set Dto be{d∈L0|[d,x] = 0}using thatVh+s/3,yx=
h+sfor allh+s∈H⊕S.
59Remark 5.16. One can changethe deﬁnition we used, by not putting the emphasis o n what wecan
say about the elements 1 in the Lie algebra and by simply requiring the e xistence of one-invertible
elements with maybe some additional assumptions. Doing so has some inherent diﬃculties.
For example, ( a,u)∈GBfor a (not necessarily unital) associative algebra Bwith involution
is one-invertible if and only if uis invertible. So, there exists a one-invertible element in GBif
and only if there exists an element 1 in B, which means that Bshould be considered structurable.
However, we learn that there exists an invertible element in the wron g way. Namely, by looking
at the second coordinate. If we assume that Bis the unital hull of some unital Cand look at
H={(g,h)∈C×B|(g,h)∈GB}, thenHis an operator Kantor system if the characteristic of Φ
is 2. This operator Kantor system should not be considered struct urable (and is not structurable
under the deﬁnition we employed).
On the other hand, we know that ( a,u) inHis 1-invertible if and only if uis invertible. Some
assumptions we could put on a, such as requiring the existence of a bsuch thatVa,b=ζ, are
satisﬁed for a= 1C. Other ones, such as (0 ,s)/ma√sto→Q(0,s)abeing invertible, do fail. However,
even if we require that the aforementioned assumptions hold, we st ill run into the problem that
(a,u)−1= (−a,−u+a¯a)/ne}ationslash= (−a,u) since the assumptions imply that a¯a/ne}ationslash= 0 = 2u. This seems a
minor problem. However, because of this “minor problem” the action of theτassociated to ( a,u)
on the Lie algebra is not guaranteed to be of order 2.
A Proof of Theorems 2.9 and 3.28
We shall prove Theorems 2.9 and 3.28 using a universal construction . Speciﬁcally, let G±be vector
groups and U±be their universal representations U(G±). SetFequal to the free product U+∗U−
of associative algebras where we identify the units of U+,U−so that these units correspond to
the unit in F. Recall that H(G+,G−,F) is the subalgebra of Fgenerated by all the νi,i(x,y) for
x∈G+andy∈G−inFand that the universal representation is given by exp[s](x) =/summationtext∞
i=0sixi
forx∈G±. We also write exp( sx) for exp[s](x).
We will mod an ideal Iout that corresponds to imposing the conditions of Theorem 2.9 on F
and nothing more. In doing so, we will also lift the functions o2,1,o3,1,ν3,2which are maps that
depend on the representation in A, to mapso2,1,o3,1,ν3,2toF/I.
We consider the ideal Icorresponding to equalities
ν(i1,...,in),(j1,...,jm)(x1,...,x n,y1,...,y m) =u(i1,...,in),(j1,...,jm),x1,...,xn,y1,...,ym∈U±
i−j
(where we still need to deﬁne the u) for
n/summationdisplay
k=1ik≥2m/summationdisplay
k=1jkor/parenleftig/summationdisplay
ik,/summationdisplay
jk/parenrightig
= (3,2).
Note that the ( i1,...,in) inνdenote linearisations; we use it just for indexing purposes in u.
Mostly, it does not matter what the uare, except that they lie in the right space U±. However,
concrete forms for the uare given by
•u2i,i,x,y= (Qgrp
xy)i,
•u3i,i,x,y= (Txy)2i,
60•ui,j,x,y= 0 ifi>2jandi/ne}ationslash= 3j,
•u3,2,x,y= (Pxy)1,
in whichQgrp
xydenotes an element in G±that maps to o2,1(x,y) inAand in which TandPare
deﬁned similarly. In the case that Qgrp,T,Pare deﬁned from an injective representation we know
that (x,y)/ma√sto→ui,j,x,y∈U±is a homogeneous map13, so we can linearize ui,j,·,·to obtain the
u(i1,...,in),(j1,...,jm),x1,...,xn,y1,...,ym.
If there is no injective representation, then one can take random elements in U±which map to
ν(i1,...,in),(j1,...,jm)(x1,...,x n,y1,...,y m)∈A
under the non-injective representation. We assume that these r andom elements have the right
grading, i.e., u(i1,...,in),(j1,...,jm),x1,...,xn,y1,...,ymis/summationtextik−/summationtextjkgraded.
Lemma A.1. For injective representations, the algebra F/Iis a Hopf algebra.
Proof.One easily sees that the generators of the ideal Iform a coideal using the fact that
∆(u(ki1,...,ki n),(kj1,...,kj m),v) =/summationdisplay
m+n=ku(mi1,...,mi n),(mj1,...,mj m),v⊗u(ni1,...,ki n),(nj1,...,nj m),v
if gcd(i1,...,j m) = 1 and that the same holds for ν(i1,...,in),(j1,...,jm)(v), where vstands for
x1,...,x n,y1,...,y mwith allxi∈G+and allyi∈G−. These equalities for uare easily ob-
tained by observing that U2,1,t,x,y=/summationtexttiu2i,i,x,yand the similarly deﬁned U3,1,t,x,yare group-like
and by using comparison of scalars for the linearisations. For the pr imitive element u3,2,x,yand its
linearisations, we can argue similarly. For νthese equations follow from Lemma 2.5.
We argue along the lines of Faulkner [13, section 6] to prove Theorem 2.9.
For a monomial m=/producttextk
i=1(ui)ni∈F/Iwithui∈G±andni∈Nandk∈N, we deﬁne the

Additionally, the levelofmis deﬁned as

where
L={(i,j) :i<j,u i∈G+,uj∈G−}.
Something useful to note is, if f(m2)≤f(m2)′forf= deg±andf=λ, then
λ(m1m2m3)≤λ(m1m′
2m3), (A.1)
13This requires, technically, an argument since Q,T, andPare not necessarily uniquely determined over non ﬂat
Φ-algebras K. However, we are only interested in the linearisations of u, which can be recovered from ﬂat Φ-algebras
alone. After we determined the linearisations of u, we can recover what Q,TandPshould be over arbitrary K.
61holds, for all m1,m3,sinceλ(m1m2) =λ(m1)+λ(m2)+deg+(m1)deg−(m2) holds for all m1,m2.
LetMpq(r) be the span of all the monomials mwith deg+(m)≤p, deg−(m)≤qandλ(m)≤r.
DeﬁneHas the image of H(G+,G−,F) under the projection F−→F/I, i.e., it is the subalgebra
ofF/Igenerated by all νi,i(x,y) forx∈G+andy∈G−.
Consider the statement InforF/I: “all theνi,j(g+,g−) with min( i,j)≤nare contained in
U+HU−”. We know that I1holds. We will be using induction to prove In, as part of a proof of
Theorem 2.9.
Recall that we use exp( sx) = exp[s](x) to denote the image of x∈G±under the universal
representation in F. We work in F/Ifrom now onward.
Lemma A.2. For allp,q∈Nand allx∈G+,y∈G−we have
xpyq≡νp,q(x,y) modMpq(pq−1).
Proof.We look at the terms with coeﬃcient sptqin

exp(oa,b(x,y),satb),
andrealizethat xpyqistheonlytermthatisnotnecessarily0mod Mpq(pq−1)ontheleft-handside.
If we look at the right-hand side, νpq(x,y) is the only term which is not a product of multiple terms.
Each of these products has a lower level since the last contributing term has nonzero deg+.
Lemma A.3. Considern∈Nandd=gcd{/parenleftbign
i/parenrightbig
|1<i<n}. In that case d/ne}ationslash= 1if and only if n=pe
for a prime pandd=p.
Proof.Faulkner [13, Lemma 21] proved this.
Lemma A.4. Consider even n >2andd=gcd{/parenleftbign
i/parenrightbig
|1< i < n, 2i/ne}ationslash=n},thend= 2ord= 4if
n= 2e,d=pifn= 2pefor an odd prime p, andd= 1in all other cases.
Proof.We write 2k=n.
SetS={/parenleftbig2k
i/parenrightbig
|1<i<2k,i/ne}ationslash=k}. Suppose that there is an odd prime psuch thatp|Sand write
2k=pelwithp∤l. We have

tk+t2k≡(1+t)2k≡1+/parenleftbiggl

So,l= 2,k=peandpi|Sfor some 1 ≤i≤e. We know that there exists 0 <j <ksuch that
(1+t)k= 1+ajtj+O(tj+1) modp2
withaj/ne}ationslash= 0 modp2, by Lemma A.3. Hence, we obtain
(1+t)2k≡1+2ajtj+O(tj+1) modp2.
So, we conclude that p2∤Sand thusd=p.
Now, suppose that n= 2i= 2k.Takejsuch that
(1+t)k≡1+ajtj+O(tj+1) mod 4,
withaj≡2 mod 4, which exists by Lemma A.3. We compute that
(1+t)2k≡(1+2ajtj+O(tj+1))≡1+4tj+O(tj+1) mod 8.
Hence, the maximal power of 2 that could divide all of Sis 4.
62Lemma A.5. IfInholds and if we consider p/ne}ationslash=q,min(p,q)≤n+1,x∈G+,andy∈G−, then
we know
xpyq∈ Mpq(pq−1).
Proof.If min(p,q)≤n, this is true since Inholds. So, suppose that q=n+1 (the case p=n+1
is similar). We can assume that n+1< p <2n+2, asp≥2q, either learns us that we imposed
νp,q(x,y) = (Txy)qifp= 3q,νp,q(x,y) = (Qgrp
xy)qifp= 2q, orνp,q= 0 ifp/ne}ationslash= 3q, which implies
thatxpyq∈ Mpq(pq−1) by Lemma A.2.
Suppose ﬁrst that x∈G+
2andy∈G−
2. We can assume that p= 2l,q= 2ksincexpyq= 0
otherwise. Using the fact that/parenleftbiggl
a/parenrightbigg
xp=x2axp−2a,
which holds by Construction 1.28.6, and the fact that x2axp−2ayq=xp−2ax2ayq∈ Mpq(pq−1),
which holds by induction since min( a,p−1)≤n, we see that all/parenleftbigl
i/parenrightbig
-multiples of xpyqwith 0<i<l
and all/parenleftbigk
j/parenrightbig
-multiples with 0 <j <kare contained in Mpq(pq−1). The greatest common divisor of
all those binomial coeﬃcients is 1 by Lemma A.3 since there are no powe rsa,bof the same prime
such thata < b < 2a. So, we conclude that xpyq∈ Mpq(pq−1), since gcd( a1,...,a n) =k, for
ai∈Z, implies that there exist integers b1,...,b nsuch that

i=1aibi=k.
Suppose now that x∈G+andy∈G−

i.e., 1.28.7. Analoguous to the previous case, one argues that all/parenleftbigp
i/parenrightbig
,0< i < p,/parenleftbigq
j/parenrightbig
,0< j < q
multiplies of xpyqare contained in Mpq(pq−1), except possibly the/parenleftbigq

multiples since the
expression for/parenleftbigq
q/2/parenrightbig
ymqcontains (2 ·2y)q. Ifq= 2, and thus p= 3, we can use that x3y2≡ν3,2(x,y)
modM32(5) andν3,2(x,y)∈ M10(0)⊂ M32(5). Ifq >2, then the set S={/parenleftbigq
a/parenrightbig
|a/ne}ationslash= 1,q,q/2}is
nonempty. Since pandqcannot both be powers of the same prime, we can use Lemma A.4 and
Lemma A.3 to conclude that xpyq∈ Mpq(pq−1).
Lastly, suppose that x∈G+andy∈G−. Using the previous case and analogous argumentation
to the ﬁrst case one proves that xpyq∈ Mpq(pq−1).
Lemma A.6. Each element of F/Ican be written as an element in U−HU+≤F.
Proof.We will show that Inimplies that the statement Jr: “Mpq(r) is contained in U−HU+for
allp,qsuch that min( p,q)≤n+1”, holds for all r. SinceI1holds, proving that all Jrholds, lets
us conclude that the lemma holds, as it proves by induction (i) that all Inhold and (ii) that the
lemma holds if all Inhold since/uniontext
p,q,rMp,q(r) =F.
We use induction on rto proveJr. Ifr= 0, this is trivial. So, suppose that r >0. Take a
monomialm∈ Mpq(r) but not in Mpq(r−1). This monomial cannot factor as m=m1xaybm2,
with 0/ne}ationslash=a/ne}ationslash=b/ne}ationslash= 0,x∈G+andy∈G−by Lemma A.5 and (A.1). Now, consider a factorization
63m1xizjycm2,withi,j,c/ne}ationslash= 0 withx,z∈G+andy∈G−. Using the previous case, we conclude that
j=c. Now, we use that i/ne}ationslash= 0, to obtain that
m1xizcycm2=m1
(xz)i+c−/summationdisplay
k+l=i+c,l/negationslash=cxkzl
ycm2∈ Mpq(r−1)
using the previous case. Similarly, it cannot factor as m1xaycwdm2withcd/ne}ationslash= 0 or 0 /ne}ationslash=c+d/ne}ationslash=a
forx∈G+andy,w∈G−.
Hence,mdecomposes as a product
m1·/productdisplay
(xi)pi(yi)pi·m2,
withm1∈U−,m2∈U+,xi∈G+andyi∈G−. Applying Lemma A.2 learns us that this product
can be rewritten as
m1·/productdisplay
(xi)pi(yi)pi·m2≡m1·/productdisplay
νpi,pi(x,y)·m2modMpq(r−1).
So,mis an element of U−HU+by the induction hypothesis.
Proof of Theorem 2.9. The non-moreoverpart is Lemma A.6. For the moreoverpart, we ﬁr st prove
thattheimageof V+ofU+=U(G+)isadirectsummandof F/I(withoutneedingtheprojectivity).
Suppose that we have an element
k/summationdisplay
i=1yihixi,
withyi∈V−,xi∈V+andhi∈ Hand assume that all the yi,xiare nicely graded (i.e., homoge-
neous). We want to prove that
k/summationdisplay
i=1yihixi∈V+,
implies that yihi∈Φ for alli. First of all, we can assume that ǫ(xi) = 0 for all i, since/summationtextyihi∈V+
implies, using the fact that this element is necessarily 0-graded, tha tǫ(/summationtextyihi) =/summationtextyihi. Take
the terms with the yiwith minimal grading in F/I(or equivalently with maximal grading in V−),
which we assume to be −n, and take of those terms the ones with ximaximally graded, which we
assume to be mgraded. Note that m>0. We call the set of those terms S. We compute if −n<0,
usingπithe projection on the ith grading component of F/I, that
0 =µ/parenleftigg

i=1yihixi/parenrightigg/parenrightigg
=/summationdisplay
yhx∈Syh(1)S(h(2))h(3)x=/summationdisplay
t∈St
using that the function of the left-hand side must evaluate to 0 on U+, the fact that ∆( h) =
h⊗1+1⊗hmod kerǫ⊗ǫ, and where we used Sweedler summation notation so that
h(1)S(h(2))h(3)=h,
for allh∈ H.
64Now, to resolve the n= 0 case, consider/summationtext
ihixiwithhi/∈Φ. We can assume that ǫ(hi) = 0
for alli. We use
0 =µ/parenleftigg

ihixi/parenrightigg/parenrightigg

iS(hi,(1))hi,(2)xi−/summationdisplay

ihixi.
This proves that V+is a direct summand. Note that the projection πV+acts as
πV+(yhx) =ǫ(yh)x
fory∈V−,h∈ H,x∈V+.
For projective G+, we can see that Hopf algebra map f:U(G+)−→F/Iis an embedding
because
(f(1−ǫ))⊗n+1∆n(y) = (1−ǫ)⊗n+1∆n(f(y)),
for ally∈ U(G±) and since finduces an embedding of Lie( G+)−→F/I(the mapU+−→A
factors through F/I). More precisely, using the well-behavedness of projective vecto rgroups this
can be used to prove that (1 −ǫ)⊗n+1∆nfcorresponds to an injective map Yn+1/Yn−→(F/I)⊗n+1
for alln(namely, one can use the argumentation of Lemma 1.43) which can be used to prove the
injectivityYn+1−→F/Iusing induction on n. Thus, we see that V±∼=U(G±).
Now, we only need to prove that F/I∼=V−⊗H⊗V+as modules since this implies that both
spaces are isomorphic as coalgebras. It is easy to check that
µ◦(S⊗Id⊗S)◦(πV−⊗Id⊗πV+)◦∆2(yhx) =ǫ(x)ǫ(y)h
for ally∈U−,h∈ H,x∈U+. This yields a projection πh:F/I−→ H.
Note thatyhx=µ(πV−⊗πh⊗πV+)∆2(yhx) for ally∈V−,h∈ H,x∈V+. So, we conclude
that
yhx/ma√sto→(πV−⊗πh⊗πV+)∆2(yhx)
forms a coalgebra isomorphism F/I−→V−⊗H⊗V+.
Now, we assume that we are working with the vector groups ρ+(G+) andρ−(G−) in order to
proveTheorem3.28. So, we use the previouslyconsidered F/IwithU+the universalrepresentation
ofρ+(G+) and similarly deﬁned U−.
Consider the Lie subalgebra LofF/Igenerated by the g1,h1forg∈G+andh∈G−. We add
a grading element of F/I, namely take F/I⊗Φ[ζ] with associative product deﬁned from
k⊗ζ·l⊗p(ζ) =kl⊗ζp(ζ)+ikl⊗p(ζ),
forlin thei-th grading component of F/Iandp(ζ)∈Φ[ζ]. We eﬀectively added a single generator
ζand relations [ ζ,l] =ilfori-gradedl. Given this interpretation, we do not write the ⊗-sign
anymore. We use Jto denote the ideal

i=0gi(one can prove that only giwithi≤2 contribute in the
conjugation action).
65Lemma A.7. The Lie algebra (L⊕Φζ)/Jis isomorphic to the Lie algebra associated to the pre-
Kantor pair (ρ+(G+),ρ−(G−)).
Proof.We ﬁrst prove that the underlying modules of both Lie algebras are t he same. We see that
Lie(ρ+(G+)) embeds into F/Iand the same holds for G−. The 0-graded part of the Lie algebra can
be identiﬁed with certain maps G±−→Lie(G±) using [δ,g1] =δ(g)1andg2δ−g1δg1+δ×(g−1)2=
−δ(g)2+δ(g)1g1, and this identiﬁcation is bijective because we divided the ideal Jout. To prove
that all the Vx,yare contained in L0, one uses Lemma 2.12 to prove that [ x,y] corresponds exactly
toVx,y.
One easily checks that the other brackets coincide, proving the iso morphism.
We call the action
x/ma√sto→(a/ma√sto→x·a=x(1)aS(x(2)))
ofF/Ion itself, using Sweedler summation notation, the adjoint action .
Lemma A.8. The adjoint action of F/IonL⊕Φζinduces an action of the pre-Kantor pair
(ρ+(G+),ρ−(G−))on(L⊕Φζ)/Jwhich coincides with the usual action of a pre-Kantor pair on its
associated Lie algebra.
Proof.We only need to check that certain elements act as expected on L⊕Φζunder the adjoint
action. For the elements g1, this is the case since the Lie algebras are isomorphic. For elements
g3,g4this is easily checked using that T,P,Rcoincide, on the Lie algebra, with µi,j(g,h) for
(i,j) = (3,1),(3,2),(4,2) respectively. For g2one notes that the map τg,vacts as the same as
g2v2−g1v2g1+v2(g−1)2forv2∈[G,G] and thatg2·δ=−δ(g)2+(δ(g)1)g1is used as part of the
deﬁnition of δ(g) for 0-graded primitive δ.
Proof of Theorem 3.28. We only need to prove the axioms for operator Kantor pairs, as the rest
was already proved below the statement of Theorem 3.28. All the ax ioms for operator Kantor pairs
follow from the fact that ν3,2(x,y) = (Pxy)1,ν2i,i(x,y) = (Qgrp
xy)ifori= 2,3 andν5,2(x,y) = 0,
using Remark 3.23, since the adjoint action satisﬁes
x·ab= (x(1)·a)(x(2)·b).
B Computations
B.1 Lemma 1
For a pre-Kantor pair ( G+,G−) we have an operator V. We will often write Vx,yzwithz∈A+∼=
G+/(G+

Vx,yz=−Q(1,1)
z,xy.
66Lemma B.1. Let(G+,G−)be a pre-Kantor pair. The following equations hold for all g,h,x,a ∈

Proof.Theseequationsareobtainedbylinearizingthe expressionsinthe De ﬁnition3.9for P(3,(1,1)),

result. The other expressions are obtained more easily.
Lemma B.2. Let(G+,G−)be a pre-Kantor pair. For x∈G+,a,b∈G−we have
τ(2,(1,1))
x,a,b=−Vb,Qxa+Va,xVb,x,
τ((1,1),2)
b,a,x−1=−VQxa,b+Vb,xVa,x.
Proof.Inordertoavoidsubtletieswiththesecondcoordinate,weassume thatd(g1,g2) = (d1(g1),d2(g2))
withdia linear function for derivations d. This can be assumed if we work with the ﬁrst 2 coordi-
nates of the universal representation. Consequently, we can sa y that
δ(ψ(a,b)) =ψ(δ(a),b)+ψ(a,δ(b)),
without ever running into identiﬁcation issues.
Both equations that we want to prove are equivalent. To observe t hat this is the case set
g= (t·1a)b∈G(Φ[t]), and consider the equation
τx,g+τg−1,x−1−V2
x,g= 0
used in the deﬁnition of τ, cfr., Deﬁnition 3.5. Comparing the terms belonging to tshows that both
equations are equivalent.
So, suppose that x∈G+,a,b∈G−. We show that the ﬁrst equality holds on G−and the second
onG+, in order to prove that both equations hold in InStr( G).
We ﬁrst evaluate the τ(2,(1,1))
x,a,batg∈G−. The ﬁrst coordinate is
P(1,1,1)
g,b,ax−1= (VQxa,b+Va,xVb,x)1g
by Lemma B.1. Hence, the left and right-hand side agree on the ﬁrst coordinate. The second
coordinate is
R(2,1,1)
g,b,ax−1−ψ(Qgx,Q(1,1)
b,ax)+ψ(P(1,1,1)
g,b,ax−1,g)
67which equals
T(2,1)
g,bQxa−Va,xT(2,1)
g,bx−1+ψ(Q(1,1)
g,bx,Q(1,1)
g,ax)+ψ(P(1,1,1)
g,b,ax−1,g).
We can factor Va,x, using the expression for P(1,1,1)of Lemma B.1 and the fact that δ(ψ(a,b))
equalsψ(δa,b)+ψ(a,δb) to obtain
T(2,1)
g,bQxa+ψ(Vb,Qxag,g)+Va,x(T(2,1)
g,bx+ψ(Vb,xg,g)).
So, by evaluating the right-hand side of the equation we want to pro ve, we conclude that the
left-hand side and the right-hand side have the same action on G−.
Now, we prove that the second equality holds as functions on G+. The ﬁrst coordinate of
τ(1,1)
b,a,x−1gequals
P((1,2),(1,1))
g,x (a,b) =VQxa,bg+Vx,bVx,ag.
This proves the equality on the ﬁrst coordinate. The second coord inate equals
R((2,2),(1,1))
g,x (a,b)−ψ(Qga,Qxb)−ψ(Qgb,Qxa)+ψ(P((1,2),(1,1))
g,x (a,b),g).
By substituting the linearisation of Rappearing in Lemma B.1, we can conclude that the second
coordinate equals
−Vg,bT(1,2)
g,xa−Vx,bT(2,1)
g,xa+ψ(Q(1,1)
g,xa,Q(1,1)
g,xb)+[Qxa,Qgb]+ψ(P((1,2),(1,1))
g,x (a,b),g).(B.1)
We want to prove that this expression equals the second coordinat e of (VQxa,b+Vb,xVa,x)(g),i.e.,
that it equals
T(2,1)
g,Qxab+ψ(VQxa,bg,g)+Vb,x(T(2,1)
g,xa+ψ(Va,xg,g))).
We use the equality
T(2,1)
g,Qxab=T(1,2)
Qxa,gb+T(2,1)
[Qxa,g],gb= [Qxa,Qgb]−Vg,bT(1,2)
g,xa,
to rewrite the expression above as
−Vg,bT(1,2)
g,xa+[Qxa,Qgb]+ψ(VQxa,bg,g)+Vb,x(−T(2,1)
g,xa+ψ(Va,xg,g))).
So, to conclude the equality between that and Equation (B.1), we mu st check

Vx,bacts as a derivation on ψ.
B.2 Computation of T
We work with the structurable algebra and corresponding vector g roup associated to a hermitian
cubic norm structure. Set g= ((a,j),(u,aj+j♯))∈G. First, we compute
Qg(b,k) =((a,j)(¯b,k))(a,j)−(u,aj+j♯)(b,k)
=(a¯b+T(j,k),ak+bj+j×k)(a,j)
−(ub+aT(j,k)+T(j♯,k),uk+a¯bj+¯bj♯+¯a·j×k+j♯×k)
=(a2¯b−ub+aT(k,j)+bT(j,j)+T(j♯,k),
a¯ak−uk+T(j,k)j+b¯aj−¯a·j×k+¯bj♯+(j×k)×j−j♯×k).
68By linearising, we obtain that l=Q(1,1)
(a,j),(a,j)(b,k) equals
(2a2¯b−a¯ab+2aT(k,j)+bT(j,j)+T(j×j,k),
a¯ak−T(j,j)k+2T(j,k)j+2b¯aj−2¯a·j×k+2¯bj♯+2(j×k)×j−(j×j)×k).
We want to compute [ l,(a,j)]. This is easily computed by computing the ﬁrst coordinate of l(¯a,j)
and calling it t, and then using [ l,(a,j)] = (t−¯t,0). We get that
t= 2a2¯b¯a−ab¯a2+3a¯aT(k,j)+b¯aT(j,j)+¯aT(j×j,k)−T(j,j)T(k,j)+2T(j,k)T(j,j)
+2b¯aT(j,j)+2¯aT(j×k,j)+¯bT(j×j,j)+2T((j×k)×j,j)−T((j×j)×k,j).
Using that
T(j×k,j) =T(j×j,k), T((j×k)×j,j) =T(j,(j×j)×k),2j♯=j×j,3N(j) =T(j,j♯)
we obtain
t−¯t= 3(s−¯s)
with
s=−ab¯a2+a¯aT(k,j)+¯abT(j,j)−aT(k,j×j)−T(j,j)T(k,j)−2bN(j)−T(j×(j×j),k).
We can rewrite this sas
s= (a¯a−T(j,j))(T(k,j)−b¯a)−2/parenleftbig
T(ak,j♯)+bN(j)+T(j♯×k,j)/parenrightbig
.
Finally, we can compute Tif there is no 3-torsion using the formula
Tg(b,k) = [(a,j),Qg(b,k)]+s−¯s,
provedinLemma5.2, usingthat3(¯ s−s) coincideswith theright-handsideofthedeﬁning expression
ofT. To see that this scoincides with that expression, observe that the mentioned expre ssion in
Lemma 5.2, is obtained by computing [( a,j),Q(1,1)
(a,j),(a,j)(b,k)] = 3(¯s−s). Using the same technique
as before, we compute that
[Qg(b,k),(a,j)] =v−¯v,
with
v=b¯a(2T(j,j)−u−a¯a)+T(k,j)(2a¯a−T(j,j)−u)−T(ak,j♯)−3/parenleftbig
bN(j)+T(j♯×k,j)/parenrightbig
.
So, we conclude that
Tg(b,k) =w−¯w,
withw=s−v= (u−T(j,j))(b¯a)+(u−a¯a)T(k,j)−T(ak,j♯)+bN(j)+T(j♯×k,j).
