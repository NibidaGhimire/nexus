A Initial conditions for Laplace-diﬀerence equation 25
11 Introduction
It has been shown in [1,2] (see also [3–5]) that the four-point corr elation function of superconformal primary
operatorsof the stress tensor multiplet in N= 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory can be computed
exactly when we integrate out the spacetime dependence with a cer tain choice of the measure. Such physical
observables are called integrated correlators and they are relate d to the partition function of N= 2⋆SYM
onS4, which can be computed using supersymmetric localisation [6]. There are two known choices of the
integration measure [1,2]. For one of these measures, the integra ted correlator is given by
CGN(τ,¯τ) =1
4∆τ∂2
mlogZGN(τ,¯τ;m)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
m=0, (1.1)
whereτ=θ/(2π) +i4π/g2
YM=τ1+iτ2is the complexiﬁed Yang-Mills coupling, ∆ τ= 4τ2
2∂τ∂¯τis the
hyperbolic laplacian, and ZGNis the partition function of N= 2⋆SYM with gauge group GNonS4,
which can be viewed as N= 4 SYM deformed by some mass terms (denoted as min the above formula)
in the hypermultiplet. Due to supersymmetric localisation, the partit ion function ZGNcan be expressed as
anN-dimensional matrix-model integral over Coulomb branch paramet ers with an integrand that contains
both perturbative and non-perturbative instanton contribution s [6,7]. It was found in [8–10] that CGN(τ,¯τ)
obeys a set of recursion relations, which were called Laplace-diﬀere nce equations, that relate the integrated
correlatorsof diﬀerent gauge groups1. For example, in the case of SU(N) that we will consider in this paper,
the Laplace-diﬀerence equation takes the following form
∆τCN(τ,¯τ) =N(N−1)CN+1(τ,¯τ)−2(N2−1)CN(τ,¯τ)+N(N+1)CN−1(τ,¯τ), (1.2)
where to simplify the notation we have denoted CSU(N)(τ,¯τ) asCN(τ,¯τ).
Following the earlier proposal [1], the supersymmetric localisation com putation has been recently applied
to more general correlators of the form /a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
pO(j)
p/a\}bracketri}ht[12],2whereO(i)
pis a superconformal primary of di-
mension pthat is charged under SU(4) R-symmetry (so we will call pcharge or dimension interchangeably).3
In general, there are multiple operators which have the same dimens ionp(whenp >3), and the superscript
iis to label the degeneracy. We will denote these more general integ rated correlators as C(i,j)
N,p(τ;¯τ), and they
are modular functions of ( τ,¯τ) due to Montonen-Olive duality of N= 4 SYM with SU(N) gauge group [17].
Whenp= 2, it reduces to the integrated correlator CN(τ,¯τ) that appeared in (1.1) and (1.2). It was argued
in [1,12] that C(i,j)
N,p(τ;¯τ) forp >2 can be related to the partition function of N= 2⋆SYM on S4deformed
by the higher-dimensional operators O(i)
p, which again can be computed via supersymmetric localisation.
Certain examples of integrated correlators for particular values o fpas well as a particular class of operators
(called maximal-trace operators) were explicitly studied in [12]. Remar kably, as demonstrated in [12], recur-
rence relations were found for certain examples of integrated cor relators, which relate integrated correlators
of diﬀerent ranks of the gauge group as well as diﬀerent charges, generalising the Laplace-diﬀerence equation
given in (1.2).

q/angbracketrightis non-trivial in N= 4 SYM only if p=q, see e.g. [13–15].
3See also [16] for recent related work on these integrated cor relators in the planar limit.
2In this paper, we will prove that the integrated correlators C(i,j)
N,p(τ;¯τ) for any pandNobey a universal
Laplace-diﬀerence equation that relates the integrated correlat ors of operators with diﬀerent charges. The
localisation computation is performed on S4, where there is mixing for operators with diﬀerent dimensions
due to the dimensionful radius of S4. The mixing is resolved through the Gram-Schmidt procedure [1,18].
To systematise the Gram-Schmidt procedure and simplify the localisa tion computation, it is important to
reorganise the operators, as we describe in section 2.2. After this crucial reorganisation, the four-point
functions now take the following form,
/a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
p|MO(i′)
p′|M′/a\}bracketri}ht,with O(i)
p|M:= (O2)pO(i)
0|M, (1.3)
where we have reorganised the higher-dimensional operators, wh ich are now denoted as O(i)
p|M. HereM=
0,3,4,..., and superscript idenotes possible degeneracy for a given M, which happens when M≥6. We
will simply omit the index iforM <6. When M= 0,O0|0=Iis the identity operator, and in general
O(i)
0|Mis a dimension- Moperator that is deﬁned recursively in (2.15). Therefore O(i)
p|Mhas dimension 2 p+M,
and for the correlators to be non-trivial, we must have 2 p+M= 2p′+M′(sop′is not an independent
variable). We will denote the integrated correlators associated wit h the four-point functions given in (1.3) as
C(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ). It will be shown that it is crucial to normalise the integrated corre latorsappropriately, and
the integrated correlators including this important normalisation fa ctor will be denoted as /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ).
We will then prove that remarkably /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) obeys a universal Laplace-diﬀerence equation that
relates the integrated correlators with diﬀerent charges p,4which takes the following form,
∆τ/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) = (p+1+δ)(p+a+1)/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p+1(τ,¯τ)+p(p+a+δ)/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p−1(τ,¯τ)
−[2p(p+a)+(2p+a+1)(δ+1)]/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ)−4δM,M′δi,i′CN(τ,¯τ),(1.4)
where
a=N2+M+M′−3
2, δ =M−M′
2, (1.5)
and the “source term” CN(τ,¯τ) is the integrated correlatorthat appeared in (1.1), whose expre ssion is known
exactly, and obeys its own Laplace-diﬀerence equation as given in (1 .2) [8,9].5. The Laplace-diﬀerence
equation (1.4) is a recursion relation that completely determines /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) for any pin terms of the
initial condition /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,0(τ,¯τ).
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In section 2, we will intr oduce the integrated correlators
involving operators with general charges and their computation us ing supersymmetric localisation. The
localisation computation is performed on S4, which leads to mixing of operators with diﬀerent dimensions.
Such mixing is resolvedby a standardGram-Schmidt procedure. We w ill reorganisethe operatorsinto towers

3as well as subtowers, which are associated with Mandiin (1.3) respectively. Crucially, the operators in
diﬀerent (sub)towers have a vanishing two-point function on S4, which implies the Gram-Schmidt procedure
only needs to apply to the set of operators in a given (sub)tower. H owever, precisely because of the vanish-
ing of these two-point functions, a naive deﬁnition of integrated co rrelators from localisation following [14]
would lead to 0 /0for the integratedcorrelatorsinvolvingoperatorsin diﬀerent (s ub)towers. We will carefully
treat this issue and appropriately normalise the integrated correla tors, so that 0 /0 is avoided and symmetry
properties of the integrated correlators are made manifest. In s ection 3, we will prove that the integrated
correlatorswith the normalisationfactor deﬁned in section 2 satisf y the universalLaplace-diﬀerence equation
(1.4). We will ﬁnd that the precise form of the partition function of N= 2∗SYM that enters in the localisa-
tion computation of the integrated correlators is in fact not import ant for the integrated correlators to obey
the Laplace-diﬀerence equation. The validity of the equation relies o nly on the reorganisation of operators
and the Gram-Schmidt procedure, as well as some very basic prope rties of the partition function such as its
power behaviour as a function of τ2. In section 4, we will give some details of the supersymmetric localisat ion
computation and provide explicit perturbative results of certain int egrated correlators. In particular, we will
ﬁnd that interestingly the perturbative contributionsto integrat edcorrelatorsinvolvingoperatorsin diﬀerent
(sub)towers start at higher loops. We will mainly focus on the pertu rbative contributions, but we will also
comment on the SL(2,Z) completion of the integrated correlators and their lattice-sum re presentation. We
will conclude and comment on future directions in section 5. The pape r also includes an appendix A, in
which we will provide exact expressions for the initial conditions (i.e. t he integrated correlators with p= 0)
of the Laplace-diﬀerence equation for the integrated correlator s that are considered in section 4.
Note added : While we were ﬁnalising this paper we learned about [19] where the lar ge-chargeproperties
of integrated correlators with maximal-trace operators were ana lysed.
2 Integrated correlators of operators with general charges
In this section, we will brieﬂy review the deﬁnition of the integrated c orrelators for the four-point correlation
functions /a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
pO(j)
p/a\}bracketri}ht, andtheircomputationusingsupersymmetriclocalisation. Because thelocalisation
computation is on S4, there is a mixing for operators with diﬀerent dimensions, which is res olved through a
Gram-Schmidt procedure [1,18]. To systematise the Gram-Schmid t procedure and simplify the localisation
computation, it is crucial to reorganise the operators appropriat ely [18]. The operators will be organised
into diﬀerent towers, and each tower may further contain subtow ers. We will perform the Gram-Schmidt
procedure and determine the mixing coeﬃcients that are associate d with these reorganised operators. We
will then introduce the normalisation factor for the integrated cor relators, which will play an extremely
important role in obtaining a universal Laplace-diﬀerence equation f or the integrated correlators.
2.1 Integrated correlators from localisation
We are interested in correlation functions of four half-BPS superc onformal primary operators in N= 4
SYM. These operators will be denoted as O(i)
p, whereprefers to the scaling dimension that is protected
4by supersymmetry. The superscript idenotes the degeneracy, which happens when p≥4. Often, the
superscript iis omitted if there is no degeneracy. The operator O(i)
ptransforms in the [0 ,p,0] representation
of theSU(4) R-symmetry, therefore we also may refer to pas charge. Explicitly, in terms of fundamental
scalar ﬁelds ΦI(hereI= 1,···,6 is theSO(6) R-symmetry index), the operators have the following forms:
for the single-trace operators, we have6
Tp(x,Y) =1
pYI1···YIpTr/parenleftbig
ΦI1(x)···ΦIp(x)/parenrightbig
, (2.1)
whereYIis a null SO(6) vector; the multi-trace operators are given by
Tp1,···,pn(x,Y) =p1···pn
pTp1(x,Y)···Tpn(x,Y), (2.2)
wherep=/summationtextn
i=1pi. It is clear that for a given dimension p≥4, there are in general more than one
distinguishable operator. For example, O2, which appears in the deﬁnition of the integrated correlators, is
simplyT2, and at dimension four, one may choose O(1)
4=T4andO(2)
4=T2,2.
We now consider the correlation functions of these operators. Tw o- and three-point correlation func-
tions are protected by supersymmetry [20], and the ﬁrst non-triv ial case is the four-point correlators. We
will consider a special class of correlators of the form /a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
pO(j)
p/a\}bracketri}ht. Because of the constraints from
superconformal symmetry, the correlators can be expressed a s [21,22]
/a\}bracketle{tO2(x1,Y1)O2(x2,Y2)O(i)

wherewehaveseparatedthe resultofthe correlatorintoa freep art,G(i,j)
free, that is independent ofthe coupling
and can be computed simply by free-ﬁeld Wick contractions, and a pa rt that non-trivially depends on the
dynamics of the theory. For the dynamic part, one can further fa ctor out the R-symmetry dependence,
denoted I4(x,Y) (the expression can be found in [1,12]), which is completely ﬁxed by t he symmetry. The
function H(i,j)
N,p(U,V;τ,¯τ) is our main focus, which is a modular function of the complexiﬁed Yang -Mills
coupling τand the cross ratios,

It also depends on the rank of gauge group N, the dimension of the operator p, and the degeneracy indices
(i,j).
As shown in [1] (see also [12] for further clariﬁcation, including the no n-perturbative instanton eﬀects),
this particular type of correlator can be computed by supersymme tric localisation, once the space-time
dependence has been integrated out with a certain measure. More concretely, we deﬁne the integrated
correlators as [1]

Note in the above expression the repeated indices µ,νare summed. The vectors vi,µ

pare the so-called
mixing coeﬃcients, which are named as such due to the fact that on S4, operators with diﬀerent dimensions
can mix because of the additional dimensionful parameter, i.e. the r adius of S4[18]. We will discuss the
mixing coeﬃcients in more detail later.
The connection between the integrated correlators and the part ition function of N= 2∗SYM can be
roughly understood as follows. Two derivatives in mass mbring down two O2’s, and the derivatives vi,µ

by supersymmetric localisation, and can be expressed as [6]

6In general, all the operators we consider are linear combinations of Tp1,···,pnthat are deﬁned in (2.2).
For the localisation computation, one can insert the operator Tp1,p2,...,pnby taking the derivative
∂τ′p1,p2,...,pn=∂τ′p1∂τ′p2...∂τ′pn, (2.12)
where each ∂τ′
pirepresents inserting the operator Tpi. It is important to note that, as the LHS, the RHS in
the above deﬁnition should be understood as a single derivative, for example,
∂τ′p1,p2,...,pnlogZN(τ,τ′

As we commented earlier, the appearance of the vectors vi,µ
p,¯vj,ν
pis due to the Gram-Schmidt procedure
to resolve the mixing of operators on S4[18]. In general, a dimension- poperator on S4could mix with
operators of dimensions ( p−2),(p−4) etc. Such mixing is resolved through the Gram–Schmidt procedur e by
requiring the connected two-point functions of operators with diﬀ erent dimensions to vanish. To simplify
the Gram–Schmidt procedure, we will reorganise the operators int o diﬀerent towers (as well as subtowers)
in the next subsection.
2.2 Organisation of operators
The localisation computation and the Gram–Schmidt procedure are g reatly simpliﬁed by reorganising the
operators appropriately. We will organise all superconformal prim ary operators as [18]
O(i)
p|M= (T2)pO(i)
0|M, (2.14)
where (T2)pdenotes the multi-trace operator T2,2,...,2as deﬁned in (2.2), i.e. it has pcopies of T2(which has
also been called O2). The operator O(i)
0|M, which will be deﬁned shortly, has dimension Mand consequently
O(i)
p|Mhas dimension 2 p+M. To deﬁne O(i)
0|M, we begin by considering a general operator Tp1,p2,...,pnas given
in (2.2) with all pi>2 (namely, T2is excluded). These operators are ordered according to their dime nsions,
which are labeled as B(i)
Mwith dimension Mandidenotes possible degeneracy. In the case of no degeneracy,
we may simply omit the iindex. The ﬁrst few examples are B0=I,B3=T3,B4=T4, andB5=T5(there
is no degeneracy for M <6). ForM= 0, we deﬁne O0|0=B0=I, which is the identity operator, and then
O(i)
0|MwithM≥3 are deﬁned recursively as
O(i)

where we have used the deﬁnition (2.14) for O(j)

M′=M. Hereδ= (M−M′)/2 so that O(j)
δ|M′has the same dimension as B(i)

ForM <6 there is no degeneracy, and these operators actually coincide wit h the so-called single-particle
operators SM[14], which aredeﬁned to have vanishing two-pointfunctions with all t he multi-trace operators,
namely
/a\}bracketle{tSM, Tq1,q2,...,qn/a\}bracketri}ht= 0,forn≥2. (2.20)
There is non-trivial degeneracy when M≥6. For example, when M= 6, we can choose B(1)
6=T3,3and

whereO(2)
0|6is again the single-particle operator at dimension six [14], whereas O(1)
0|6, which is orthogonal to
T2,2,2andT4,2but notT3,3, may be thought as the “next-to-single-particle operator”.
In this way, we organise the operators into diﬀerent towers, and w ithin a given tower, there may be
also subtowers. In particular, O(i)
p|M(for any p) is in the i-th subtower of the M-th tower. The operators
Op|0(andOp|3) are also known as the maximal-trace operators [12], as they conta in a maximal number of
traces for operators with a given dimension 2 p(and 2p+ 3). The property (2.18) implies that operators
in diﬀerent towers as well as diﬀerent subtowers are orthogonal t o each other on S4. Therefore, the Gram-
Schmidt procedure only needs to be applied to operators within a give n subtower, which greatly simpliﬁes
the procedure and consequently the localisation computation.
2.3 Gram-Schmidt procedure
In this subsection, we will determine the mixing coeﬃcients vµ
p|Mfor all the operators O(i)
p|Mthat are deﬁned
according to (2.14). As we have emphasised, because of the import ant orthogonal property (2.18), we only
need to apply the Gram-Schmidt procedure for the operators in th e same subtower. The mixing coeﬃcients

7This is because for M= 0, the ﬁrst non-trivial operator is T2, which according to our deﬁnition is O1|0, i.e.M= 0,p= 1
9We will now prove that the mixing coeﬃcient vµ
p|Mgiven in (2.25) is indeed the solution to the equations
(2.22). Consider the M/\e}atio\slash= 0 case, for which we will use (2.24). We ﬁrst note,

Each diﬀerential operator ∂τ′(i)

which vanishes identically for 0 ≤q < p. One can similarly prove the result for the M= 0 case.
2.4 Normalisation of integrated correlators
We have now appropriately organised the operators and determine d the corresponding mixing coeﬃcients,
and so we will now consider the integrated correlators that are ass ociated with the four-point functions of
the following general form
/a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
p|MO(i′)
p′|M′/a\}bracketri}ht. (2.34)
Note that the operators O(i)
p|MandO(i′)
p′|M′need to have the same dimension, i.e. 2 p+M= 2p′+M′, therefore
one may remove the dependence on p′. We will denote these integrated correlators as C(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ).
However, the deﬁnition of /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) following (2.8) in general is problematic now. Following (2.6), we
would naively write,
C(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) =R(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p
4/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ),(2.35)
10where/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) according to (2.8) would be given by
/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) =vµ
p|M¯vν

τ′
A=0, (2.36)
where again ∂τ′(i)
µ|Mrepresents inserting operator O(i)
µ|M, withµ= 0,1,...,pforM >0, and with µ= 1,...,p
ifM= 0; and R(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p is determined by the two-point function via
/a\}bracketle{tO(i)
p|M(x1,Y1),O(i′)
p′|M′(x2,Y2)/a\}bracketri}ht=R(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p/parenleftbiggY1·Y2
x2
12/parenrightbigg2p+M
. (2.37)
However, (2.36) is only valid for the special cases with M=M′andi=i′; for other cases the denominator
in the expression is zero, precisely due to the orthogonality proper ty (2.18). The integrated correlators
C(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) are of course in general non-zero and well-deﬁned, because the prefactor R(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p ∼
/a\}bracketle{tO(i)
p|M,O(i′)
p′|M′/a\}bracketri}htalso vanishes when the denominator of (2.8) vanishes. Therefore, we have the issue of 0 /0
in these cases.
To deal with this issue when O(i)
p|Mis not identical to O(i′)
p′|M′, we ﬁrst note the four-point function
/a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
p|MO(i′)
p′|M′/a\}bracketri}htcan be written as
/a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
p|MO(i′)
p′|M′/a\}bracketri}ht=/a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
p|MO(i)
p|M/a\}bracketri}ht+/a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
p|MOd/a\}bracketri}ht, (2.38)
whereOd=O(i′)
p′|M′−O(i)
p|M. Applying the above relation to the integrated correlators, we hav e
C(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) =R(M,M|i,i)
N,p
4/hatwideC(M,M|i,i)
N,p(τ,¯τ)+ROd
4/hatwideCOd(τ,¯τ),(2.39)
where the second term schematically denotes the integrated corr elator associated with /a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
p|MOd/a\}bracketri}ht.
Using (2.8) from supersymmetric location, /hatwideC(M,M|i,i)
N,p(τ,¯τ) and/hatwideCOd(τ,¯τ) can be expressed as
/hatwideC(M,M|i,i)

Odand∂¯τ′
ν|Odare not needed for the following arguments.
Note neither R(M,M|i,i)
N,p,ROdnor the denominators of /hatwideC(M,M|i,i)
N,p(τ,¯τ) and/hatwideCOd(τ,¯τ) given in the above
vanish, so each term is well-deﬁned. Importantly, because of the v anishing of the two-point function,
/a\}bracketle{tO(i)
p|M,O(i′)
p′|M′/a\}bracketri}ht= 0, we have
R(M,M|i,i)
N,p +ROd= 0, (2.41)
11and the denominators of /hatwideC(M,M|i,i)
N,p(τ,¯τ) and/hatwideCOd(τ,¯τ) are also related to each other via

As 2p+M= 2p′+M′, this relation implies that in obtaining the expression for C(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) one could
also eliminate O(i)
p|Min favour of O(i′)
p′|M′, and lead to the same result for C(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ). This gives a
consistency check of the argument.
One could simply use (2.44) to compute the integrated correlators C(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ). However, we ﬁnd it is
much more convenient and extremely useful to introduce a normalis ation factor, and express the integrated

However, with this normalisation, we ﬁnd that /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) does not obey a simple Laplace-diﬀerence relation. The
denominator in this deﬁnition is not very natural, as p,p′are not on an equal footing. Furthermore, we also ﬁnd factori ng out/radicalBig
R(M′,M′|i′,i′)

so thatC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) agrees precisely with the expression given in (2.44). As we will prove later, the
integrated correlatorsnormalised in this particular way, i.e. /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) given in (2.48), obey a universal
Laplace-diﬀerence equation, which relates /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) with diﬀerent charges p.
Let us now explain all the ingredients as well as the motivation for the denominator that appeared in the
deﬁnition of/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ). The factor D(M,M′)
N,pin the denominator – the crucial part in the deﬁnition of

will be presented in the next section. Finally, the factor N(i)
Mis introduced so that when M′=Mandi′=i,
/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)

The motivation of deﬁning D(M,M′)

which is then symmetric in M,M′and reduces to N(i)
MwhenM=M′,i=i′. However, this is not important for the purpose
of obtaining the Laplace-diﬀerence equation (1.4) since al l thep-dependence is contained in D(M,M′)
N,p.
13M=M′,i=i′, it is easy to see that as a function of τ2, it should behave as τ−N2+M+M′−1

2 , following the
same argument of obtaining (2.29). The additional factor i(M−M′)/2is just to ensure that D(M,M′)
N,pis real.
The extra term in (2.51) is because, when M′= 0, the one-point function /a\}bracketle{tOp′|0/a\}bracketri}htS4/\e}atio\slash= 0. We will see a
similar diﬀerence between the cases of M′= 0 and M′/\e}atio\slash= 0 for the numerator of /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) when we
write it out explicitly.
From the deﬁnition (2.50), and the expression of mixing coeﬃcients ( 2.25), we can explicitly evaluate
D(M,M′)
N,p. We ﬁnd it can be expressed as
D(M,M′)

which simpliﬁes to
D(M,M′)
N,p= 2−2p−δ(a+1)p+Θ(δ)Γ(p+δ−Θ(δ)+1)τ−(a+1+δ+2p)

where Θ( x) = 0 ifx≥0 and Θ( x) =xifx <0, and the parameters a,δare given by
a=N2+M+M′−3
2, δ=M−M′
2. (2.56)
Using 2p+M= 2p′+M′, one can see that D(M,M′)
N,pis symmetric under M↔M′,p↔p′. Without loss of
generality, one may assume M≥M′so that Θ( δ) = 0. When M′= 0, we have,

which is in fact equivalent to the k= 0 case of the ﬁrst term. Therefore we can combine these two ter ms
in (2.57), which leads to the same expression as (2.54). We see that w ith the extra term in the deﬁnition of
D(M,0)
N,p, the ﬁnal expression for D(M,0)
N,pis simply D(M,M′)
N,pgiven in (2.55) with M′→0.
Using the relation (2.45) and the expressions for N(i)
NandD(M,M′)
N,pas given in (2.52) and (2.55), we can
simplify the normalisation factor /tildewideR(M,M′|i,i′)
N,pas given in (2.49), and ﬁnd
/tildewideR(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p =22p+δM2

14Note by construction, when M=M′andi=i′,/tildewideR(M,M′|i,i′)
N,preduces to R(M,M|i,i)
N,p.
From now on, we will mainly focus on /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) as deﬁned in (2.48). In the next section, we will
prove that, with this crucial normalisation factor /tildewideR(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p ,/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) obeys a universal Laplace-
diﬀerence equation that gives a three-term recursion relation rela ting the integrated correlators of diﬀerent
chargesp.
3 Laplace-diﬀerence equation
In this section, we will show that the normalised integrated correlat ors/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N;p(τ,¯τ) as deﬁned in (2.48)
satisfy the following universal Laplace-diﬀerence equation,
∆τ/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) = (p+1+δ)(p+a+1)/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p+1(τ,¯τ)+p(p+a+δ)/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p−1(τ,¯τ)
−[2p(p+a)+(2p+a+1)(δ+1)]/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ)−4δM,M′δi,i′C(0,0)
N,1(τ,¯τ),(3.1)
where the parameters a,δare given in (2.56), and ∆ τ= 4τ2
2∂τ∂¯τ. The “source term” C(0,0)
N,1(τ,¯τ), which
only appears when M=M′andi=i′, is given in (1.1) (now it is written in our uniﬁed notation). It also
obeys a Laplace-diﬀerence equation (1.2) and is known exactly for a nyNandτ[8,9]. It is important to
note that because /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) = 0 when p <0, (3.1) is a recursion relation (rather than a diﬀerential
equation) that determines /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) for any pin terms of the initial data /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,0(τ,¯τ). In the
special case M=M′= 0 (the operators were called maximal-trace operators with even d imensions), our
Laplace-diﬀerence equation (3.1) reproduces what has been foun d in [12]. We will therefore mainly focus on
M >0 in the cases with M=M′,i=i′. It is intriguing to note that the N-dependence of the recursion
only appears in the parameter a(given in (2.56)), which has the symmetry of N2↔M+M′.
Interestingly, the diﬀerence of integrated correlators,
/hatwideH(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) =/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ)−/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p−1(τ,¯τ), (3.2)
also satisﬁes a three-term recursion relation,
∆τ/hatwideH(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) =(p+1+δ)(p+a+1)/hatwideH(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p+1(τ,¯τ)+ (p−1)(p+a+δ−1)/hatwideH(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p−1(τ,¯τ)
−[(p+a)(p+δ)+p(p+a+δ)]/hatwideH(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ).
(3.3)
Note the above recursion relation for /hatwideH(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) is valid only for p≥1. It is worth emphasising that
it is non-trivial that a three-term recurrence relation exists for t he diﬀerence /hatwideH(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ).
In the following subsections, we will prove the Laplace-diﬀerence eq uation (3.1).
3.1 Cases with M=M′,i=i′
In this subsection, we consider the cases with M=M′andi=i′. As we mentioned we will focus on M >0
with general Mhere. For these particular cases, by construction the denominat or in (2.48) reduces to
N(i)

µ|M∂¯τ′(i)
ν|MlogZN(τ,τ′

m=τ′
A=0, (3.4)
15so we have
/hatwideC(M,M|i,i)
N,p(τ,¯τ) =vµ

p|M∂τ′(i)

A=0. (3.5)
AsZN(τ,τ′
A;m) is an even function of m, we have

m=0=∂2
mZN(τ,τ′
A;m)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
m=0
ZN(τ,τ′

and from (2.18), we have

A=0=∂¯τ′(i)
ν|MZN(τ,τ′

We therefore ﬁnd
/hatwideC(M,M|i,i)

mZN(τ,0;m)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

ZN(τ,0;0).(3.8)
Let us ﬁrst consider the second term in the above equation. The lap lacian acting on it leads to
∆τ∂2
mZN(τ,0;m)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
m=0
ZN(τ,0;0)= 4C(0,0)
N,1(τ,¯τ). (3.9)
Using this fact, one can see that this term alone obeys the Laplace- diﬀerence equation (3.1). Therefore, from
now on we will only focus on the ﬁrst term of (3.8), which we will denote as/hatwideC′(M,M|i,i)
N,p(τ,¯τ) and quote as
below,
/hatwideC′(M,M|i,i)
N,p(τ,¯τ) =vµ
p|M¯vν
p|M∂τ′(i)
µ|M∂¯τ′(i)

µ|M∂¯τ′(i)
ν|MZN(τ,τ′

τ′
A=0. (3.10)
Since the source term −4C(0,0)
N,1(τ,¯τ) arises from the second term of (3.8) as we just showed, we will pro ve
that/hatwideC′(M,M|i,i)
N,p(τ,¯τ) obeys (3.1) without the source term, namely
∆τ/hatwideC′(M,M|i,i)
N,p(τ,¯τ) = (p+1+δ)(p+a+1)/hatwideC′(M,M|i,i)
N,p+1(τ,¯τ)+p(p+a+δ)/hatwideC′(M,M|i,i)
N,p−1(τ,¯τ)
−[2p(p+a)+(2p+a+1)(δ+1)]/hatwideC′(M,M|i,i)
N,p(τ,¯τ),(3.11)
withδ= 0 due to M=M′. In the next subsection, we will in fact see that, for the integrate d correlators
withM/\e}atio\slash=M′orM=M′buti/\e}atio\slash=i′, what we will need to prove is essentially the same as (3.11) (with δ/\e}atio\slash= 0
ifM/\e}atio\slash=M′).
3.2 Cases with M/\e}atio\slash=M′ori/\e}atio\slash=i′
We now consider the cases with M/\e}atio\slash=M′, i.e. the operatorsarein diﬀerent towers, or the cases with M=M′
buti/\e}atio\slash=i′, i.e. the operators are in diﬀerent subtowers. For all these cases , because the two-point functions
vanish, we need to use the reﬁned deﬁnition (2.48) for /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ). We will ﬁrst consider both Mand
M′are not 0. Besides (3.7), we also have the relation
∂τ′(i)
µ|M∂¯τ′(i′)
ν|M′ZN(τ,τ′
A;)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
τ′
A=0= 0, (3.12)
16when the operators are in diﬀerent (sub)towers. Therefore, un like (3.8),/hatwideC(M,M|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) has no analogical
second term, and so
/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) =vµ
p|M¯vν
p′|M′∂τ′(i)
µ|M∂¯τ′(i′)
ν|M′∂2
mZN(τ,τ′
A;m)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
m=τ′
A=0
N(i)
MD(M,M′)
N,p. (3.13)
Therefore in these cases, there is no source term −4C(0,0)
N,1(τ,¯τ), consistent with the Laplace-diﬀerence equa-
tion (3.1).
WhenM′= 0, the relation (3.7) is not valid anymore. In particular, we have
∂τ′(1)
µ|0ZN(τ,τ′
A;0)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
τ′
A=0=∂µ
τZN(τ,0;0)/\e}atio\slash= 0. (3.14)
Here and in the following, because there is no degeneracy when M′= 0, we set the degeneracy index ias 1.
Equation (3.14) implies that there is an additional term in /hatwideC(M,0|i,1)
N,p(τ,¯τ),
/hatwideC(M,0|i,1)
N,p(τ,¯τ) =vµ
p|M¯vν

This important diﬀerence between (3.13) and (3.15) is similar to the de ﬁnition (2.51) for the normalisation
factor in the case of M′= 0, as we emphasised earlier.
In the next subsection, using these explicit expressions of /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) we have obtained in the above
analysis, we will prove that /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) satisﬁes the universal Laplace-diﬀerence equation (3.1).
3.3 Proof of Laplace-diﬀerence equation
We will now prove the Laplace-diﬀerence equation (3.1). Just as in (2 .28), we have,

A;m)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
m=τ′
A=0with derivatives
with respect to τand ¯τacting on it. To prove the Laplace-diﬀerence equation (3.1), we will c ollect
all the terms with the same number of derivatives of τand ¯τ, and show that the corresponding coeﬃ-
cients vanish. Therefore we ﬁnd that the Laplace-diﬀerence equa tion does not rely on the precise form
of∂τ′(i)
0|M∂¯τ′(i′)
0|M′∂2
mZN(τ,τ′
A;m)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
m=τ′
A=0. Furthermore, as we discussed in the previous subsections, beca use
there is some diﬀerence between the cases of M′= 0 and the cases of M′>0, we will consider them
separately. Without losing generality, we will assume M≥M′in the following discussion.
173.3.1 Cases with M′>0
We begin with the case M′>0. Using the result of D(M,M′)
N,pas given in (2.55) and the mixing coeﬃcients
(2.25), we can express /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) as
/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) =1

As we commented above, the validity ofthe Laplace-diﬀerenceequa tion is actually independent ofthe precise

We therefore isolate the jandk-th derivative

Taking the laplacian ∆ τ= 4τ2
2∂τ∂¯τand collecting the jandk-th derivatives, we ﬁnd

Let us now consider the following combination that is relevant for the Laplace-diﬀerence equation (3.1),

N,p (τ,¯τ)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

Using the above results, (3.23) becomes

evaluates to zero.
Clearly the above discussion also applies to the special case M=M′andi=i′, namely/hatwideC′(M,M|i,i)
N,p(τ,¯τ)
deﬁned in (3.10) and the relation (3.11) it satisﬁes. This proves the L aplace-diﬀerence equation for the case
M′>0.
3.3.2 Cases with M′= 0
The proof of the Laplace-diﬀerence equation for the case M′= 0 is similar. When M′= 0, analogous to
D(M,0)
N,pin the denominator in (2.51), the numerator of /hatwideC(M,0|i,1)
N,p(τ,¯τ) also has an extra term, as given in
(3.15). Explicitly, /hatwideC(M,0|i,1)

of the Laplace-diﬀerence equation (3.1).

tions ofSL(2,Z) modular properties of the integrated correlators, the perturb ative contributions actually
uniquely determine the full integrated correlators. For the pertu rbative contributions, we can simply omit
the instantonic contribution Zinstin the partition function (2.9), and the small- mexpansion of Z1−loopcan

It is straightforward to compute these integrals explicitly, at least up to some ﬁnite orders. To illustrate the

withM,M′≤5, and as we mentioned they coincide with the single-particle operato rs when p= 0. Since
there is no degeneracy for these cases, we will simply drop the indice siandi′for all these examples.
4.1 Integrated correlators with M=M′
We begin with the integrated correlators with M=M′. The special case M=M′= 0 has been considered
in [12], so we will only consider those with M >0, and the results are listed as follows:

It is easy to check that the above results are solutions to the Lapla ce-diﬀerence equation. When p=
0, the above expressions reproduce the results for the integrat ed correlators involving the single-particle
operators that were considered in [12], which also serve as the initial conditions for the Laplace-diﬀerence
equation. These particular examples clearly show some intriguing str uctures of the perturbative expansion.
For example, we observe that the leading term in all the examples we s tudied takes the simple form of
6N(2p+M)ζ(3)/(τ2π).
Finally, to obtain C(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p , we will also need the expression for /tildewideR(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p that appeared in the def-
inition (2.47). Recall for the identical operators, namely the cases withM=M′andi=i′,/tildewideR(M,M|i,i)
N,p=
R(M,M|i,i)
N,p, which is determined in terms of the two-point function as given in (2.3 7). Because two-point
functions are protected by supersymmetry, it is straightforwar d to compute them simply by Wick contrac-
tions. For example, for a particular set of operators O(i)

The cases with M= 3,4,5 are relevant to the integrated correlators we consider here.
4.2 Integrated correlators with M/\e}atio\slash=M′
In this subsection we consider the examples of integrated correlat ors with M/\e}atio\slash=M′, forM,M′≤5. First, we
note all the integrated correlators /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p withM+M′being an odd number always vanish. Therefore
we only need to consider the cases with ( M,M′) = (4,0) and (M,M′) = (5,3), which we will list below:

Again, we have omitted the degeneracy index i. It is also straightforward to verify that these are solutions
to the Laplace-diﬀerence equation (3.1), and in appendix A we also pr ovide the initial conditions for the
recursion relation, namely /hatwideC(4,0)
N,0(τ,¯τ) and/hatwideC(5,3)
N,0(τ,¯τ) for any Nandτ. The perturbative expansion of the
integrated correlators obeys interesting structures that are s imilar to those with M=M′. However, we also
note that interestingly the integrated correlators with operator s that are in diﬀerent (sub)towers in general
start at higher loops in the perturbative expansion. For the examp les we considered here, they both begin
at two loops. In a related context, a similar phenomenon was observ ed for the U(1)-violating correlators in
N= 4 SYM studied in [25,26].
Again, to obtain C(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p , we now compute the normalisation factor /tildewideR(M,M′|i,i′)
N;p. For the integrated
correlatorswith operatorsin diﬀerent (sub)towers, we use the e xpressiongiven in (2.59). For M= 4,M′= 0,

4.3SL(2,Z)completion and lattice-sum representation
In the previous subsections we presented examples of the pertur bative expansions (i.e. zero instanton sector)
of integrated correlators. The complete results of integrated co rrelatorsare SL(2,Z) modular invariant func-
tions of ( τ,¯τ) because of Montonen-Olive duality of N= 4 SYM with SU(N) gauge group [17]. Therefore,
22the perturbative results should be completed into some modular fun ctions, which in general is not unique
at all. However, as already noted in the case of /a\}bracketle{tO2O2O2O2/a\}bracketri}htin [9], by assuming the so-called lattice-sum
representation of the integrated correlator, which has been pro ved recently in [27], one can show that the
integrated correlator is completely determined in terms of the zero -instanton perturbative results [9,10]10.
Essentially the same property was assumed in [14] (using the languag e ofSL(2,Z) spectral decomposition
following [30]) for the more general integrated correlators we are c onsidering here, which was veriﬁed by
explicit perturbative and non-perturbative results [14].
Here we will brieﬂy discuss the SL(2,Z) completion of the integrated correlators and their lattice rep-
resentation. In a forthcoming paper [31], we will study in detail the la ttice representation of the integrated
correlatorsand its implications, such as the modular properties of in tegrated correlators,and their behaviour
in the large-charge limit. Following [9], we propose that /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) can be expressed as
/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) =/summationdisplay
(m,n)∈Z2/integraldisplay∞

N,p(t)dt,(4.12)
withYm,n(τ,¯τ) :=π|m+nτ|2
τ2. The above expression is manifestly SL(2,Z) invariant, and all the non-trivial
information of the integrated correlators is encoded in the single ra tional function of t,/hatwideB(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(t). The
function/hatwideB(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(t) obeys several important properties, for example,
/hatwideB(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(t) =1
t/hatwideB(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(1/t),/integraldisplay∞
0dt√
t/hatwideB(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(t) = 0. (4.13)
What is relevant to the current discussion is that, using (4.12), one can show that /hatwideB(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(t) is uniquely
determined by the perturbative results of /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p(τ,¯τ) [9,10]. Furthermore, as the Laplace-diﬀerence
equation(3.1) is alsoin an SL(2,Z)-invariantform, onemay solvethe equation andobtain modular fun ctions
for the integrated correlators, providing the SL(2,Z)-invariant initial data. Following the ideas of [27],
one can in fact further introduce SL(2,Z)-invariant generating functions, that sum over all the charge-
pdependence of the integrated correlators. The concept of the g enerating functions for the integrated
correlators and their explicit expressions and applications will be stu died in detail in [31].
5 Conclusion and outlook
In this paper we studied integrated correlators in SU(N)N= 4 SYM associated with four-point correlation
functions of the form /a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
pO(j)
p/a\}bracketri}ht, for the half-BPS operators O(i)
pwith charge (or dimension) p. To
systematise the supersymmetric localisation computation, we reor ganised the operators into diﬀerent towers
as well as subtowers of the form O(i)
p|M= (O2)pO(i)
0|M, with index Mdenoting the tower and ithe subtower.
Crucially, operators in diﬀerent towers (and subtowers) are orth ogonal to each other, which greatly simpliﬁes
theGram-Schmidtprocedureforthelocalisationcomputation. Wep rovedthat, remarkably,alltheintegrated

with/angbracketleftO2O2O2O2/angbracketrightinN= 4 SYM with other classical gauge groups, and the manifestat ions of Goddard, Nuyts and Olive
duality [29].
23correlators for any Nsatisfy a universal Laplace-diﬀerence equation that relates integ rated correlators of
diﬀerent charges p. It is vitally important to normalise the integrated correlators appr opriately for them to
obey the Laplace-diﬀerence equation. This is especially important wh en the integrated correlators involve
two diﬀerent operators, as a naive choice of the normalisation fact or would either lead to 0 /0, or some
very complicated Laplace-diﬀerence equation that would obscure t he underlying simplicity of the integrated
correlators.
An analogous Laplace-diﬀerence equation, i.e. (1.2), was found in [9 ] for the integrated correlator associ-
ated with /a\}bracketle{tO2O2O2O2/a\}bracketri}ht, which relates the integrated correlator of diﬀerent gauge group s. Even though the
equations may look similar, they seem to arise from diﬀerent origins. T he proof of the Laplace-diﬀerence
equation of [9], as was done recently in [27], crucially relies on the explicit form of the partition function of
N= 2∗SYM that enters in the localisation computation. As we showed, in pro ving the Laplace-diﬀerence
equation of this paper which relates integrated correlators with diﬀ erent charges, the precise form of the
partition function is not important. Our Laplace-diﬀerence equatio n in this sense is more similar to the
Toda equations for the extremal correlators in N= 2 supersymmetric theories [18,32–34]. In both cases, the
recursionrelationsrelatecorrelatorsofoperatorswith diﬀerent charges,andthe validityofrecursionrelations
does not rely on the precise form of the partition functions that en ter in the localisation computation.
The Laplace-diﬀerenceequationprovidesa powerfulrecursionre lation that pavesthe wayfor determining
the integrated correlators in terms of initial data. To completely de termine all the integrated correlators,
one would also need to compute all initial conditions, i.e. /hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p (τ,¯τ) withp= 0. We provided
some examples of these initial conditions in appendix A. They seem to a lso obey some interesting recursion
relations relating integrated correlators with diﬀerent N[12]. It will be very interesting to study these initial
conditions systematically and understand better the recursion re lations that are satisﬁed by them.
The unintegrated correlators /a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
pO(j)
p/a\}bracketri}hthave been studied extensively in various limits in the lit-
erature. In the perturbative region, the correlators are known up to two loops for general p[35] (and three
loops in the planar limit [36]), and up to three loops for p= 2 [37]. The integrands however are known to
higher loops [38–40]. In the strong coupling limit, they have been comp uted using bootstrap approaches and
holographically in the planar limit [41–50]11and beyond [52–60]. Our results provide additional important
informationabout these correlatorsthat areexactwith ﬁnite τand makethe SL(2,Z)symmetry manifest. It
is feasible that one could reconstruct unintegrated correlators b y writing down an appropriate ansatz, prob-
ably in the large- plimit, and to use our results as constraints to ﬁx the ansatz. It wou ld also be interesting
to exploit the higher-loop integrands to study the relations betwee n the perturbative parts of our results and
these Feynman integrals using the connections between integrate d correlators and Feynman integral periods
observed in [61]. It would be particularly interesting to understand f rom the standard Feynman integral
point of view the absence of the lower-loop terms in the perturbativ e expansion of the integrated correlators
involving operators in diﬀerent (sub)towers.
Another natural question that arises from our results is to solve t he Laplace-diﬀerence equation, and to
obtain explicit expressions for the integrated correlators and to u nderstand the dependence on the charge
11See also [51] for the recent results of the extension to the ﬁv e-point correlator /angbracketleftO2O2O2O(i)
pO(j)

24p. Following the ideas of [27], this can be conveniently done by introducin g the generating functions of
the integrated correlators, which sum over the charge- pdependence. In a forthcoming paper [31], we will
see that the Laplace-diﬀerence equation becomes a diﬀerential eq uation for the generating functions, and
we will solve the equation explicitly and derive the generating function s of the integrated correlators. We
will be particularly interested in the large- pbehaviour of the integrated correlators. From the generating
functions, we will ﬁnd that in the large- pexpansion, the integrated correlators take a universal form, wh ich
resembles the large- Nexpansion of the integrated correlators [27]12withpandNexchanged, albeit with
some interesting and subtle diﬀerences.

A Initial conditions for Laplace-diﬀerence equation
In this appendix, we will provide exact results for the integrated co rrelators/hatwideC(M,M′|i,i′)
N,p withp= 0 for
M,M′≤5, namely the initial conditions for the Laplace-diﬀerence equation f or the examples that we
considered in section 4. It was found in [12] that the integrated cor relators associated with /a\}bracketle{tO2O2O(i)
pO(j)
p/a\}bracketri}ht
forp≤5 obey some recursion relations that relate these integrated corr elators with diﬀerent N. As we

For the relevance of this discussion, the examples given in (2.19) are quoted below,

N(N2+1)T2,2,O0|5=T5−5(N2−2)
N(N2+1)T2,3.(A.1)
As we commented, they also coincide with the identical single-particle operators. The integrated correlators
involving two identical single-particle operators with M <6 have been considered in [12]. In our notation,
they are/hatwideC(M,M|i,i)
N,0(τ,¯τ), withM= 3,4,5. Therefore, here we will only consider the cases with M/\e}atio\slash=M′.
Since there is no degeneracy we will also drop the indices i,i′, and the only non-trivial cases are /hatwideC(4,0)
N,0(τ,¯τ)
and/hatwideC(5,3)
N,0(τ,¯τ), which we will present below.
Using (A.1), we have the following relation between four-point funct ions

which implies the same relation for the corresponding integrated cor relators. It was found in [12] (see section
3 of the reference) that the integrated correlators associated with/a\}bracketle{tO2O2T4T2,2/a\}bracketri}htand/a\}bracketle{tO2O2T2,2T2,2/a\}bracketri}htobey
someN-dependent recursion relations. Solving these recursion relations , using (A.2) and adapting to our
