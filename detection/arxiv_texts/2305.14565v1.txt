EQUATIONS USING COMPLETE INTEGRABILITY
ANDREIA CHAPOUTO AND JUSTIN FORLANO
Abstract. We consider the real-valued defocusing modiﬁed Korteweg-d e Vries equation
(mKdV) on the circle. Based on the complete integrability of mKdV, Killip-Vi¸ san-Zhang
(2018) discovered a conserved quantity which they used to pr ove low regularity a priori
bounds for solutions. It has been an open question if this con served quantity can be used
to deﬁne invariant measures supported at fractional Sobole v regularities. Motivated by
this question, we construct probability measures supporte d onHs(T) for 0< s <1/2
invariant under the mKdV ﬂow. We then use the Miura transform to obtain invariant
measures for the Korteweg-de Vries equation, whose support s are rougher than the white
noise measure.
1.Introduction
We consider the real-valued modiﬁed Korteweg de-Vries equa tion (mKdV):
∂tq=−∂3
xq±6q2∂xq, (1.1)
posed on the circle T=R/Z. This equation (1.1) is also known as the Miura mKdV
equation after [34]. We say that (1.1) is defocusing with the positive sign in front of the
nonlinearity, and focusing with the negative sign. The mKdV equation (1.1) has garnered
much attention from the mathematical community due to its ri ch structure, as it is both
Hamiltonian and completely integrable. The Hamiltonian fo r mKdV is given by
HmKdV(q) =1
2ˆ1
0(∂xq(x))2±q(x)4dx, (1.2)
which generates the dynamics of (1.1) through the Poisson br acket

A natural question, motivated by the ﬁnite-dimensional Ham iltonian setting, is the exis-
tence of probability measures which are invariant under the ﬂow of an inﬁnite-dimensional
Hamiltonian system. This has been a very active ﬁeld of resea rch in the past thirty years,
initiated by Lebowitz-Rose-Speer [31] and Bourgain [4, 5]; see also [14, 55, 33]. In this
paper, we aim to construct new invariant measures for mKdV, i nspired by the recent work
of Tzvetkov [51] and the conserved quantities discovered by Harrop-Griﬃths, Killip, Vi¸ san,
and Zhang [28, 18]. We also extend this construction to the Ko rteweg-de Vries equation
(KdV) equation via the Miura map.
A natural candidate for an invariant measure is the Gibbs mea sure
“dρ1=Z−1exp(−HmKdV(q)−M(q))dq”. (1.4)

which is also conserved under (1.1). We have included it in (1 .4) to better align with our

which allowed themtorigorously constructthemeasures ρ1,RforanyR >0. Theinvariance
of the Gibbs measures (1.5) and (1.6) under the ﬂow of (1.1) wa s proven by Bourgain [4].
In order to discuss the invariance of measures such as ρ1, we ﬁrst need dynamics, at least
deﬁned almost surely on their support. Much is known on the we ll-posedness of mKdV
(1.1); see [24, 48, 3, 4, 7, 47, 38, 36, 22, 35, 46, 12] and refer ences therein. In particular,
exploiting complete integrability, Kappeler-Topalov [22 ] proved global well-posedness in
L2(T). An alternative proof was given by the second author in [12] , using the method of
commuting ﬂows in [27, 18]. These results are sharp as Moline t [35] proved ill-posedness
belowL2(T), as well as global existence without uniqueness in L2(T); see also [46].
Returningtotheproblemofinvariantmeasures, thecomplet eintegrability ofmKdV(1.1)
implies the existence of an inﬁnite number of conserved quan titiesEk(q), fork∈N, which
control the Hk(T)-norm of solutions. See for example [30] in the context of th e also com-
pletely integrable KdV
∂tq=−∂3
xq+6q∂xq. (1.7)
Consequently, the probability measures
“dρk=Z−1
kexp(−Ek(q)−M(q))dq” (1.8)
are also natural candidate invariant measures for (1.1), wh ich would be supported on ever
more regular spaces as k∈Nincreases. This program of constructing an inﬁnite family
of invariant measures associated to the explicit higher-or der conservation laws was com-
pleted for other completely integrable equations, namely f or KdV and the cubic nonlinear
Schr¨ odinger equation (NLS) by Zhidkov [56, 57], for the Ben jamin-Ono equation (BO) by
Tzvetkov, Visciglia, and Deng in a series of papers [49, 52, 5 3, 10, 9]. Such a construction
is expected to also hold for mKdV.
The question that motivates our paper is if there exist inter mediate invariant measures
between ρkandρk+1in (1.8). This was very recently shown to be the case for BO by
Tzvetkov [50]. Namely, heconstructednon-degenerateinva riantmeasuresforBOsupported
onHσ(T) for any σ >−1
2, thus covering every regularity regime in which BO is global ly
well-posed. His proof uses the Birkhoﬀ coordinates for BO in [15]. Here, we aim to take the
ﬁrst step towards answering this question for mKdV by constr ucting, for each 0 < σ <1
2,
an invariant measure supported on Hσ(T). Whilst we are not able to cover all regularities
σ >0, although we expect this to certainly be possible (cf. Rema rk 1.3), our approach doesINVARIANT MEASURES FOR KDV AND MKDV 3
not use the existence of Birkhoﬀ coordinates. Instead, we ex ploit the completely integrable
nature of the equation from the perspective of the commuting ﬂows method in [27, 18] and
the ideas in [28].
We now motivate our construction of the invariant measures. In [28], Killip-Vi¸ san-Zhang
observed that for mKdV (and also for NLS, with appropriate mo diﬁcations), the quantity
α(κ,q) =−∞/summationdisplay
m=1(∓1)m−1
mtr{[(κ−∂)−1q(κ+∂)−1q]m}, κ≥100(1+/⌊ar⌈⌊lq/⌊ar⌈⌊l2
L2(T)) (1.9)
is conserved, at least for regular enough solutions. Here, α(κ,q) is a series expansion of the
logarithm of the perturbation determinant; see [28]. They t hen exploited this conservation
to prove a-priori Hsbounds for every −1
2< s <0.1Unfortunately, we believe that α(κ,q)
and conserved quantities based on it are unsuitable choices to deﬁne candidate invariant
measures of the form (1.4). The main obstructions are the sig n indeﬁniteness of α(κ,q) and
the restriction on κin (1.9). Both suggest that a mass cutoﬀ is necessary when deﬁ ning
the measure. However, this would force κto depend upon the size of the mass cutoﬀ,
and so would α(κ,q), albeit in a highly nonlinear and non-explicit way. We beli eve such a
restriction to be artiﬁcial.
Fortunately, in [18], a more suitable candidate was discove red. They showed that α(κ,q)
can be written in terms of a macroscopic conservation law A(κ,q), which extends by an-
alyticity to all κ≥1. Following [26, 13], we thus consider the quantity A(κ,q), whose
precise deﬁnition we defer to (2.9). Note that A(κ,q) is well-deﬁned and conserved under
the (defocusing) mKdV ﬂow for any κ≥1 andq∈C∞(T); see [13].
To recover an Hs(T)-like quantity from A(κ,q), we follow an idea in [28]. Given κ≥1
and1
2< s <1, we consider
A(κ,q) =A(κ,q)−1
2A(κ
2,q), (1.10)
and the following candidate for a conserved quantity
Es(q) :=ˆ∞
1κ2sA(κ,q)dκ. (1.11)
It follows from the conservation of A(κ,q) under the mKdV ﬂow, that A(κ,q) is also con-
served, and thus we expect the same for Es(q). We isolate the quadratic-in- qcontributions
inEs(q) by writing
Es(q) =1

(κ2+ξ2)(4κ2+ξ2),(1.12)
andV(κ,q) contains the contributions in A(κ,q) which are at least quartic in q; see (3.1).
Sincew(0,κ) = 0, the weight in (1.12) vanishes at the zero-th frequency. To avoid a
restriction to mean-zero functions, we consider Gaussian m easuresµsdeﬁned by

2< s <1 andR >0. Our ﬁrst main result is a rigorous construction of (1.15) a nd
corresponding invariance under the ﬂow of the defocusing mK dV equation (1.1).

Then,ρs,Rin(1.15)deﬁnes a probability measure on L2(T), endowed with the Borel sigma
algebra, which satisﬁes:

(iii)The measure ρs,Ris invariant under the defocusing mKdV ﬂow (1.1). More precisely,

L2(T)f(q)dρs,R(q) (1.16)
for allt∈Rand for all f∈L1(L2(T);dµs).
In view of Theorem 1.1 (ii), our measures are supported on rou gher spaces as compared
to the corresponding Gibbs measure (1.5). In this sense, The orem 1.1 constitutes an exten-
sion to lower regularities of the invariance of the Gibbs mea sure by Bougain [4]. Another
consequence of Theorem 1.1 is the quasi-invariance of Gauss ian measures under the ﬂow of
defocusing mKdV (1.1). Namely, the Gaussian measure
d/tildewideµs=Z−1

whereCs>0 is a suitable constant, is mutually absolutely continuous with respect to the

and the monotone convergence theorem (to take R→ ∞). This (only) extends the qualita-
tive statement of quasi-invariance in [44] to lower-regula rities for the mKdV equation.2We

refer to [50, 43, 8, 44] and the references therein for furthe r discussion on quasi-invariance
of Gaussian measures for dispersive PDEs.
Ouranalysisisalsoquitegeneral andweexpectsimilarresu ltstoholdtrueformanyother
completely integrable Hamiltonian PDEs, which are at least amenable to the analysis used
in the method of commuting ﬂows. In particular, we expect an a nalogue of Theorem 1.1
to hold for NLS on T, with inessential modiﬁcations. We do not pursue this quest ion
to simplify the exposition, and also emphasize the connecti on with the KdV equation,
discussed below.
Our second main contribution is the construction of invaria nt measures for KdV sup-
portedatlow regularity. Tothisend, wefocusoninitial dat awithaﬁxedmeanandconsider
the base Gaussian measure µ0
sobtained by removing the mass term in (1.13). Note that
the results in Theorem 1.1 extend to the corresponding weigh ted measures ρ0:=ρ0

have access to the (corrected) Miura transform:

L2(T),
whereL2
0(T) andH−1
0(T) are subspaces of L2(T) andH−1(T) restricted to mean-zero dis-
tributions, respectively. The Miura transform maps smooth solutions of defocusing mKdV
to smooth solutions of KdV and Kappeler-Topalov [21] showed thatBis a real-analytic
isomorphism. We deﬁne the probability measure
ν0=B#ρ0, ν0(A) =ρ0(B−1(A))
for Borel measurable sets A⊆H−1
0(T), and the map
ΦKdV
0(t)(w0) :=B◦ΦmKdV(t)◦B−1(w0) (1.19)
forw0∈H−1
0(T). The mean-zero assumption allows us to show that the KdV dyn amics
from [23, 27] agree with those in (1.19) and preserve the meas uresν0.

probability measure να:= (τ−α)#ν0= (τ−α◦B)#ρ0is invariant under the ﬂow ΦKdV
α(t)
for allt∈R.
(iii)Forα∈R, the map ΦKdV
α(t)agrees with those in [23, 27]restricted to H−1
α(T).
We also view Theorem 1.2 as an extension of the results concer ning the invariance of the
white noise measure on T, formally given by
d/tildewideµ0:=Z−1exp(−M(q))dq, (1.20)
under the ﬂow of KdV. Rigorously, the white noise is the Gauss ian measure on periodic
distributions with the identity as covariance operator. As such, it is supported on Hσ(T)
forσ <−1/2. AsM(q) is also a conserved quantity for KdV (1.7), we expect (1.20) to
be invariant under the ﬂow of KdV, which was rigorously prove d by Quastel, Valk´ o, and
Oh [45, 39, 40, 41]. The invariant measures we construct in Th eorem 1.2 are supported6 A. CHAPOUTO, J. FORLANO
onHσ(T)\Hs−3
2(T) forσ < s−3
2and1
2< s <1, thus covering the remaining well-
posedness range between the sharp well-posedness results i nH−1(T) [23, 27] and the sharp
well-posedness in H−1
2(T) for which the data-to-solution map is uniformly continuou s on
bounded sets [25].
Before discussing further details about the proof, we make t he following remarks regard-
ing the regularity restriction on sin Theorem 1.1.
Remark 1.3. Our interest in the range1
2< s <1 is due to the low regularity of the
conserved quantities considered and corresponding suppor t of the measures ρs,R, which is
strictly rougher than that of the Gibbs measure (1.5) for mKd V. We believe our method
can be extended to larger values of s, by considering further diﬀerences in deﬁning A(κ,q)
in (1.10), and introducing additional cutoﬀs depending on co nserved quantities of the form
Es(q) at regularities s−1/2−ε, for small ε >0. To keep the exposition short, we do not
pursue this direction here.
Remark 1.4. An interesting open question would be to extend the construc tion and in-
variance results in Theorem 1.1 to the singular range 0 < s≤1/2. The resulting measures
would be supported strictly below L2(T) and thus on distributions. This presents many ad-
ditional challenges: Firstly, there is no known well-posed ness result on the L2-based spaces
which contain the support of the intended measure, namely, Hσ(T) forσ <0. In fact, (1.1)
is ill-posed below L2(T) [35]. Thus, it is necessary to consider the following renor malized
mKdV equation:
∂tq=−∂3
xq±6/parenleftbig
q2−2M(q)/parenrightbig
∂xq, (1.21)
ﬁrst introduced by Bourgain [3]. In L2(T), mKdV (1.1) and the renormalized mKdV (1.21)
are equivalent, as solutions of the former can be related to s olutions of the latter via the
gauge transformation q(t,x)/ma√sto→q/parenleftbig
t,x±12tM(q)/parenrightbig
.
Outside of L2(T), based on the scaling argument on R, we expect that (1.21) is well-
posed in Hσ(T) for any σ >−1/2. The best known result in this direction is by Kappeler-
Molnar [20] usingthecomplete integrability toprove that d efocusingmKdV (1.21) islocally
well-posed in the Fourier-Lebesgue spaces FLp(T) for 2< p <∞and globally for small
data (this small data result extends to the focusing case too ). Based on scaling on the line,
FL∞(T) is a critical space for (1.21). Unfortunately, this well-p osedness result may be of
limited use for the question of invariant measures supporte d below L2(T) as the time-of-
existence of the solutions does not depend in an explicit way on the size of the initial data,
so it is unclear if one could adapt Bourgain’s invariant meas ure argument [4]. Secondly, our
argument relies heavily on the conservation of the L2-norm which is no longer be available
whens≤1/2. We instead need to replace the L2-norm cutoﬀ by one on the Wick-ordered
L2-norm. Lastly, inour proofof Theorem1.1 weonly exploit the randomnessof thesamples
(1.14) at a linear level. When s≤1/2, we need to take advantage of the randomness at
a multilinear level such as through Gaussian hypercontract ivity. We plan to pursue this
problem in a future work.
Remark 1.5. For the focusing mKdV equation, we expect to be able to constr uct cor-
responding measures ρs,Rusing the series expansion (1.9). However, as we previously
discussed, this would enforce κ≥100(1 +R), which we ﬁnd unsatisfactory. In any case,
the invariance of these measures would then follow from the w ell-posedness in [12] and the
method delineated in this paper.
Remark 1.6. In [29], Koch-Tataru constructed conserved quantities for mKdV (1.1) on
the line which control the Hσ(R)-norm for any σ >−1
2, for small initial data. If one canINVARIANT MEASURES FOR KDV AND MKDV 7
extend their results to the periodic setting and for large da ta, it may be of interest to study
the candidate weighted Gaussian measures associated with t hese conserved quantities.
We now discuss in more detail some elements of the proof of The orem 1.1. We split
the argument into two parts: (i) construction of the probabi lity measures (1.15), and (ii)
invariance under the dynamics of the defocusing mKdV (1.1).
In order to construct the measures (1.15), we need to prove th at the density is integrable
with respect to the Gaussian measure µsin (1.13). Spurred on by the construction of the
Φ4
3-measure given by Barashkov-Gubinelli [1], the Bou´ e-Dupu is variational formula [2, 54]
has proved to be a very eﬀective tool at constructing probabil ity measures with respect to a
base Gaussian measure. This reduces the integrability of th e density to a stochastic control
problem which can be handled via suitable estimates on the lo garithm of the density. In
our setting, this translates to bounds on the remainder piec eV(κ,q) which are both valid
for anyκ≥1, and come with enough decay in κfor convergence of the integral in (1.15).
The bounds on A(κ,q) come from the recent work of the second author, Killip, and
Vi¸ san [13] on the invariance of the Gibbs measure for the def ocusing mKdV (1.1) on the
line. The key point is that these bounds are proved non-pertu rbatively; thus requiring no
relation between κand theL2-norm of q. In fact, the bounds in [18, 12] are of no use.
As to the dynamical problem of invariance, we are in the fortu nate position of having
deterministicglobal well-posedness onthesupportofourm easures. Itthusremainstoprove
the invariance, for which we need an approximating ﬂow. As we rely on the well-posedness
proved from the method of commuting ﬂows, it is natural to ﬁrs t consider the approximate
Hamiltonian ﬂow of the quantity HmKdV
κ,κ≥1, deﬁned in (2.22). The heuristic at play
is that the HmKdV
κ-ﬂow (i) is easily solvable in L2(T), (ii) commutes with the HmKdV-ﬂow,
and (iii) converges to the HmKdV-ﬂow asκ→ ∞. See Proposition 2.3.
The main idea is then to prove that the HmKdV
κ-ﬂow leaves the measures ρs,Rinvariant.
We proceed in a standard way by considering a truncated versi on of the HmKdV
κ-ﬂow.
Unfortunately, at this truncated level, we cannot guarante e thatEsis conserved. To resolve
this, we use ideas from [37, 52, 53], and instead show that the se quantities are almost
conserved in the sense that asymptotically we have conserva tion in the truncation limit.
See Proposition 4.2. Due to the nicer structure of Esand of the tameness of the truncated
HmKdV
κ-ﬂow, our version of this is much stronger: it is completely d eterministic and for all
times, not just at time zero.
Theremainingofthepaperisorganized asfollows. InSectio n2, weintroducetherelevant
notation and the structures derived from the complete integ rability of the equation needed
for theconstruction andinvarianceof themeasures. Sectio n 3is devoted to theconstruction
of the measures ρs,R, while Section 4 proves their invariance under the mKdV dyna mics.
In Subsection 4.2, we prove Theorem 1.2 on invariant measure s for KdV.

Now the ﬁrst inequality follows by interpolation between (2 .2) and (2.3). The proof of the

2.2.Structures for mKdV. In this section, we recall important facts regarding the
Green’s function of the Lax operator for the defocusing mKdV (1.1):
L=Lq=/bracketleftbigg
−∂ q
−q ∂/bracketrightbigg
.
Forq∈L2(T), we view Las an unbounded operator with domain H1(R)×H1(R) which
is anti-self adjoint on L2(R)×L2(R). Thus the resolvent R(κ) := (L+κ)−1exists for
allκ≥1 and it is jointly analytic on {(κ,q) :κ≥1, q∈L2(T)}. Moreover, it admitsINVARIANT MEASURES FOR KDV AND MKDV 9
an integral kernel, which we call the Green’s function G(x,y;κ), that is a 2 ×2 matrix
satisfying
G(x,y;κ)−G0(x,y;κ) =/a\}⌊ra⌋k⌉tl⌉{tδx,[R(κ)−R0(κ)]δy/a\}⌊ra⌋k⌉tri}ht, (2.4)
whereG0is the Green’s function of the free resolvent R0(κ) := (L0+κ)−1,q≡0, and is
given by
G0(x,y;κ) =e−κ|x−y|/bracketleftbigg/BD{x<y}0
0 /BD{y<x}/bracketrightbigg
.
Furthermore, Gis a continuous function of ( x,y)∈R2,x/\⌉}atio\slash=y,G(x,y;κ)∈L∞(R2), and
all components of G(x,y;κ) decay to zero as |x| → ∞for ﬁxed y∈R.
As the Lax operator satisﬁes
L∗=−L=/bracketleftbigg
0 1
1 0/bracketrightbigg
L/bracketleftbigg
0 1
1 0/bracketrightbigg
,
the entries of G(x,y;κ) enjoy the following symmetry properties:
G11(y,x;κ) =G22(x,y;κ),
G12(y,x;κ) =G12(x,y;κ), G21(y,x;κ) =G21(x,y;κ).(2.5)
Furthermore,
detG(x,y;κ) = 0 for all x,y∈R2,x/\⌉}atio\slash=y. (2.6)
This follows from showing that the gradient of det G(x,y;κ) in the variables x,yvanishes
and then appealing to the decay at ±∞. See [13] for details.
By (2.4), wedeﬁnethefollowing linearcombinations ofthee lements of Gonthediagonal:
γ(x;κ,q) := (G−G0)11(x,x;κ,q)+(G−G0)22(x,x;κ,q),
g+(x;κ,q) :=G21(x,x;κ,q)+G12(x,x;κ,q),
g−(x;κ,q) :=G21(x,x;κ,q)−G12(x,x;κ,q). (2.7)
We will omit the dependence of γ,g+,g−on all or some of their parameters when clear
from context. We can explicitly write the quadratic in qcontributions of γ(κ,q) as follows:
γ[2](κ,q) :=−2q
2κ−∂·q
2κ+∂, (2.8)
with the shorthandq
2κ±∂= (2κ±∂)−1q. Also, let γ[≥4](κ) :=γ(κ)−γ[2](κ). Lastly, we
deﬁneA(κ,q) as follows
A(κ,q) :=ˆ
Tρ(κ,q)dx, ρ (κ,q) :=qg−(κ,q)
2+γ(κ,q). (2.9)
The conservation of A(κ,q) for smooth solutions of mKdV follows from (2.20), (1.2), an d
(1.3); see [12].
We now pause and make an important remark in order to dispel po tential confusion
arising from our convention. We stress that we are viewing th e operators, such as Land
R(κ), as operators on the Hilbert space L2(R) with a periodicpotential q, and not as acting
onL2(T). This is important since the construction of invariant mea sures independently of
the mass-cutoﬀ Rrelies crucially on the macroscopic deﬁnition (2.9) for A(κ,q). However,
this seems diﬃcult to justify from the series expansion for A(κ,q) if we had viewed these
operatorsasactingon L2(T). Themainsourceofthediﬃculty isinestablishingananalo gue
of (2.6), whichisakeystepinthisargument, forpotentials inL2(T); seetheproofofLemma10 A. CHAPOUTO, J. FORLANO
4.1 in [18]. Indeed, we expect (2.6) to not be true in the purel y periodic setting since it is
not true for the periodic free Green’s function
G0(x,y;κ) =1
1−e−κ/bracketleftbigg
eκ(x−y−⌈x−y⌉)0
0 e−κ(x−y−⌊x−y⌋)/bracketrightbigg
(2.10)
where⌈x⌉and⌊x⌋denote the smallest integer nsuch that x≤n, or the largest integer m
such that m≤x, respectively. While we may follow the same argument and sho w that the
determinant of the periodic Green’s function is independen t ofx/\⌉}atio\slash=y, it may depend upon
qand this would need to be included in the ansatz for the measur es.
Also, note that because of our convention, the operators (2 κ±∂)−1appearing in (2.8)
are deﬁned via their action on L2(R). However, since qis periodic, we have
q
2κ±∂(x) =ˆ1
0/parenleftbigg/summationdisplay
ξ∈2πZG0(x,y+ξ;2κ)/parenrightbigg
q(y)dy=ˆ1
0G0(x,y;2κ)q(y)dy,
whereG0is deﬁned in (2.10). Note that the Fourier coeﬃcients of the o perator (2 κ±∂)−1
acting on L2(T) are (2κ±iξ)−1. Thus, we may view the operators in (2.8) in the usual
way as operators on L2(T) whenever they act on a periodic function. The other operato r
of importance that will appear in this way is R0(κ) := (κ2−∂2)−1, for which we have
R0(κ)q(x) =ˆ

with periodic Fourier coeﬃcients ( κ2+ξ2)−1. We apply this remark at all further relevant
instances in this paper without further discussion.
Forκ≫1+/⌊ar⌈⌊lq/⌊ar⌈⌊l2
L2(T), the following properties of γ(κ) andg−(κ) were proven in [12];
see also [18]. For arbitrary κ≥1, the identities remain true by analytic continuation.
However, we need estimates which are valid for all κ≥1, and these were proven in a
non-perturbative fashion in [13]; see also [26] for the case of KdV.
Proposition 2.2 (Properties of γ, andg−).Letq∈L2(T)andκ≥1. Then:

Theboundsin(i) areprovedasfollows: forlarge κ, theresolvents R(κ)maybeexpanded
as an inﬁnite series for which good bounds hold. These can the n be transferred to R(κ)
for anyκ≥1 by the ﬁrst resolvent identity. The bounds in (ii) follow si milarly by also
using the second resolvent identity. Whilst (2.15) is not ex plicitly written in [13], it follows
from the estimates there and similar arguments as required f or (2.14). We note that (2.21)

We now discuss the approximating ﬂows and dynamics. Given κ≥1 andq∈L2(T), let
HmKdV
κ(q) = 4κ2ˆ1
0q(x)2dx−4κ3A(κ,q). (2.22)
Proposition 2.3. Fixκ≥1. Then, the Hamiltonian ﬂow induced by HmKdV
κ,
∂tq= 4κ2∂xq−4κ3∂xg−(κ,q) (2.23)
is globally well-posed on L2(T)and commutes with the mKdV ﬂow. Moreover, for ﬁxed
q0∈L2(T)andT >0, letΦmKdV(t)(q0)andΦmKdV
κ(t)(q0)denote the global solutions to
(1.1)and(2.23)with initial data q0, respectively. Then,
lim

|t|≤T/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleΦmKdV
κ(t)(q0)−ΦmKdV(t)(q0)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
L2(T)= 0. (2.24)
The proof of Proposition 2.3 can be found in [13], and in [12] f or large κ. We brieﬂy
detail the arguments here. Local well-posedness follows by the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem
using (2.16), and global well-posedness in L2(T) is a consequence of the conservation of
theL2(T)-norm which can be proven by using (2.17). Finally, the conv ergence of the ﬂows
(2.24) can be argued as in [12], with the additional observat ion that we can recover qfrom
g−(κ,q) andγ(κ,q) via the formula
q=1
4κ(4κ2−∂2)g−(κ)
1+γ(κ),
where the maps q/ma√sto→1
4κg−(κ,q) andq/ma√sto→γ(κ,q) are diﬀeomorphisms from L2(T) to its
range in H2(T), and from L2(T) to its range in H1(T), respectively.12 A. CHAPOUTO, J. FORLANO
Lastly, we further expand A(κ,q) and establish some estimates on this quantity. Using
thatg−(κ,q) = 4κR0(2κ)[qγ(κ)+q] and2
2+γ= 1−γ
2+γ, we have
ρ(κ,q) = 2κqR0(2κ)q+2κ

We see from (2.9) that
A[2](κ,q) =ˆ
Tρ[2](κ,q)dxandA[≥4](κ,q) =ˆ
Tρ[≥4](κ,q)dx. (2.25)
We need to expand ρ[≥4](κ,q) further. Proceeding as above, we have

3.Construction of the measures
We start by elaborating on our choice of candidate invariant measure ρs,Rand base
Gaussian measure µs. By deﬁning the operator w(−i∂,κ) := 4κ2R0(2κ)−κ2R0(κ), which
has Fourier multiplier given by (1.12), we can rewrite the qu adratic-in- qterms in Es(q) from
(2.25) as follows

wheretheFourier multiplier operator ms(−i∂) hascorrespondingmultiplier given by (1.12).
Now, we deﬁne the higher order in qtermV(κ,q) in (1.11) by
V(κ,q) :=A[≥4](κ,q)−1
2A[≥4](κ
2,q), (3.1)
whereA[≥4](κ,q) is as in (2.25).
Lemma 3.1. Let0≤s <1. Then, there exist constants C > c > 0, independent of κ,
such that

for allξ∈2πZ,ξ/\⌉}atio\slash= 0.

In order to make our computations rigorous, we need to introd uce some truncations. Given

Our goal is to prove the following result which says that the d ensityF(q) is integrable
with respect to µs, and hence the measures ρs,Rexist as probability measures.
Proposition 3.2. Fix1
2< s <1,R >0, and1≤p <∞. Then, there exists C(p,R,s)>0
such that
/⌊ar⌈⌊lF(q)/⌊ar⌈⌊lLp(dµs)≤C(p,R,s)<∞.
In particular, the partition function Zs,R:=Eµs[F(q)]is ﬁnite.
Before proving Proposition 3.2, we establish the uniform bo unds on the truncated den-
sitiesFN,L(q) inLp(dµs).
Proposition 3.3. Fix1

In order to prove Proposition 3.3, we use a variational formu la for which we need to ﬁrst
introduce some notations. Let W(t) be a cylindrical Brownian motion in L2(T)
W(t) =/summationdisplay
ξ∈2πZBξ(t)eiξx,
where{Bξ}ξ∈2πZis a sequence of mutually independent complex-valued3Brownian motions

Note that we have Law( Y(1)) =µs, where µsis the Gaussian measure in (1.13). By
settingYN=πNY, we have Law( YN(1)) = (πN)#µs, which is the pushforward of µsunder
πN. Also, let Hadenote the space of drifts, which are progressively measura ble processes
belonging to L2([0,1];L2(T3)),P-almost surely. We now state the Bou´ e-Dupuis variational

With the uniform bound of Proposition 3.3 in place, we now aim to take limits, ﬁrst as
L→ ∞and then as N→ ∞. For the ﬁrst limit, we need the following convergence resul t.
Lemma 3.7. Let1
2< s <1. Then, there exists θ >0such that
|EL1(πNq)−EL2(πNq)|/lessorsimilar(L1∧L2)−θ(1+/⌊ar⌈⌊lπNq/⌊ar⌈⌊lC
L∞) (3.13)
where the implicit constant is uniform in N∈N∪ {∞}andL1,L2>1, and for some
C >0. Moreover, Ein(3.5)is well-deﬁned as an absolutely convergent improper Rieman n
integralµs-a.s.,Ebelongs to Lp(dµs), and it satisﬁes
sup
N∈N∪{∞}/⌊ar⌈⌊lE(πNq)−EL(πNq)/⌊ar⌈⌊lLp(dµs)/lessorsimilarpL−θ.
In particular, EL(πNq)→E(πNq)inLp(dµs), uniformly in N∈N∪{∞}, andµs-a.s.
Proof.We ﬁrst prove (3.13). By symmetry, we suppose that L1> L2. Recall by (3.1),
(2.26), and (2.28) that we wrote

It follows from (2.26), Cauchy-Schwarz and (2.1) that

Similarly, from (2.29), (2.30), (2.31), Cauchy-Schwarz, ( 2.11), (2.12), (2.8), and (2.1),
|A[≥6]

Thus, (3.14) and (3.15) imply
|V(κ,q)|/lessorsimilarκ−3/⌊ar⌈⌊lq/⌊ar⌈⌊l5
L∞(1+/⌊ar⌈⌊lq/⌊ar⌈⌊l5
L∞). (3.16)
Notice that (3.16) holds for qreplaced by πNqfor anyN∈N, at which point, (3.13) follows
from (3.6). Now, (3.13) yields the existence of the limit
E(q) := lim
L→∞EL(q) =ˆ∞
1κ2sV(κ,q)dκ,
µs-a.s. in view of Remark 3.6. Moreover, E(q)∈Lp(dµs) for any 1 ≤p <∞due to (3.16).
It follows from (3.13), that for each ﬁxed N∈N, there exists /tildewideE(N)∈Lp(dµs), such that
lim
L→∞EL(πNq) =:/tildewideE(N)(q), (3.17)
where the convergence is uniform in N. We now show that µs-a.s.
E◦πN=/tildewideE(N)for allN∈N. (3.18)
Note that Ein (3.5) satisﬁes
/⌊ar⌈⌊lEL(q)−E(q)/⌊ar⌈⌊lLp(dµs)/lessorsimilarpL−θ.
FixN∈N. By the triangle inequality and (3.17), we have
/⌊ar⌈⌊lE(πNq)−/tildewideE(N)(q)/⌊ar⌈⌊lLp(dµs)≤ /⌊ar⌈⌊lE(πNq)−EJ(πNq)/⌊ar⌈⌊lLp(dµs)+CL−θ. (3.19)
Since
E(πNq)−EL(πNq) =ˆ∞
Lκ2sV(κ,πNq)dκ,
it follows from (3.16) with πNqinstead of qthat

Using this bound in (3.19) and taking L→ ∞establishes (3.18), as well as the Lp(dµs)
and almost sure convergence of EL(πNq) toE(πNq), uniformly in N∈N, asL→ ∞./square
This convergence now propagates to the densities FN,L(q).
Lemma 3.8. Let1
2< s <1andR >0. Then,
lim
L→∞/⌊ar⌈⌊lFN,L(q)−FN(q)/⌊ar⌈⌊lLp(dµs)= 0,where FN(q) := /BD{/⌊ar⌈⌊lq/⌊ar⌈⌊l2

andEgiven in Lemma 3.7. Moreover, we have

Proof.Theproofis astandardconsequence of theuniformboundin Pr oposition 3.3and the
almost sureconvergence of EL(πNq) toE(πNq) asL→ ∞, which was proven inLemma 3.7.
See for example [42, Proof of Proposition 6.2]. The uniform b ound (3.21) now follows from
the convergence in (3.20) and the uniform bound from Proposi tion 3.3. /squareINVARIANT MEASURES FOR KDV AND MKDV 19
The ﬁnal step is taking N→ ∞, which requires an additional convergence result.
Lemma 3.9. Let1
2< s <1andR >0. Then, there exists θ′>0such that
/⌊ar⌈⌊lE(πN1q)−E(πN2q)/⌊ar⌈⌊lLp(dµs)/lessorsimilarp,s(N1∧N2)−θ′(3.22)
for all1≤p <∞, andN1,N2∈N. In particular, Edeﬁned in (3.5)satisﬁes
/⌊ar⌈⌊lE(πNq)−E(q)/⌊ar⌈⌊lLp(dµs)/lessorsimilarp,sN−θ′. (3.23)
Assuming the validity of Lemma 3.9, we now complete the const ruction of the measures
ρs,R. Indeed, arguing similarly as in the proof of Lemma 3.8, (3.2 3) implies that E(πNq)
converges to E(q), almost surely with respect to µs. Combining this with the uniform
bound in (3.21), shows that
lim
N→∞/⌊ar⌈⌊lFN(q)−F(q)/⌊ar⌈⌊lLp(dµs)= 0 (3.24)
for any 1 ≤p <∞. Thus, the partition function Zs,R:=Eµs[F(q)] is ﬁnite and the measure
dµs,R:=Z−1
s,RF(q)dµs
exists as a probability measure which is absolutely continu ous with respect to the Gaussian
measure µs. Moreover, we have equivalence of ρs,Rwith the measure in (1.18) as we did
not make use of the sign out the front of E(q) in (3.5).
It remains to prove Lemma 3.9.
Proof of Lemma (3.9).Givenq1,q2∈L∞(T) andκ≥1, we ﬁrst consider the diﬀerences

where (Ω ,F,P) is the same underlying probability space as for (1.14) and Cs>0 is the
constant from (3.3). The Gaussian measures /tildewideµsare more commonly used in the study
of nonlinear dispersive PDE with random initial data or stoc hastic forcing. If one wishes
for there to not be the constant (√Cs)−1in the expansion (1.14), then one instead needs
to insert it appropriately into (1.13). The eﬀect of this woul d be to alter the inverse
temperature for the invariant measures (1.15), which has no aﬀect on their construction.
Proposition 3.10. For every1
2< s <1, the Gaussian measure µsin(1.13)is equivalent
to the Gaussian measure /tildewideµsin(1.17).
The poof of Proposition 3.10 employs Kakutani’s theorem [19 ], known as the Feldman-
H´ ajek theorem in the Gaussian setting [11, 17]. See, for ins tance, [6, Proposition B.1] for a
use of this theorem in the context of nonlinear dispersive PD Es, as well as [32] for further
references. We will use the following statement, tailored f or our context, whose proof can
be found in [32, Lemma 3.2].
Lemma 3.11. Let{Aξ}ξ∈2πZand{Bξ}ξ∈2πZbe two sequences of independent, real-valued
mean-zero Gaussian random variables with E[A2
ξ] =a(ξ)>0andE[B2

4.Invariance
In order to establish the invariance of the measures ρs,Rin (3.4) under the HmKdV-ﬂow,
we ﬁrst establish their invariance under the HmKdV
κ-ﬂow, by considering suitably “trun-
cated” dynamics induced by HmKdV
κ,N. We then extend this result to invariance for mKdV
due to the good approximation between the HmKdV
κandHmKdVﬂows (Proposition 2.3).
LetN∈N. We deﬁne new Gaussian measures as µs,N=µs,N⊗µ⊥
s,N, where
dµs,N=Z−1

and deﬁne the ﬁnite dimensional measure /tildewideρs,Nwith density
d/tildewideρs,N=Z−1
s,NF(πNq)dµs,N(q).
Then, the “truncated” measures ρs,Nare given by ρs,N:=/tildewideρs,N⊗µ⊥
s,N. Note that µs=
µs,N⊗µ⊥
s,Nfor the Gaussian measures in (1.13).
For the truncated Hamiltonian HmKdV
κ,N(q) :=HmKdV
κ(πNq), (2.22) and (2.20) imply
δHmKdV
κ,N
δq=πN/parenleftbig
4κ2πNq−4κ3g−(κ,πNq)/parenrightbig
. (4.1)
Consequently, we consider the following approximating dyn amics
/braceleftBigg
∂tqN= 4κ2∂xqN−4κ3πN∂xg−(κ,πNqN),
qN(0) =q0.(4.2)22 A. CHAPOUTO, J. FORLANO
Note that the solution qNto (4.2) decouples into qN=qlow+qhighwhich satisfy
∂tqhigh= 4κ2∂xqhigh,
∂tqlow= 4κ2∂xqlow−4κ3πN∂xg−(κ,qlow),
with initial data qhigh(0) =π>Nq0andqlow(0) =πNq0. From this, we see that the high
frequencies of qNsatisfy a transport equation, while the low frequencies evo lve under the
ﬂow generated by the truncated Hamiltonian HmKdV
κ,N.
We start by establishing the global well-posedness of (4.2) and a good approximation
property between the solutions to (4.2) and (2.23).
Lemma 4.1. Letκ≥1andN∈N. Then, the Cauchy problem (4.2)is globally well-posed
inL2(T). Denoting the data-to-solution map for (4.2)byΦmKdV
κ,N(t), we have that
/⌊ar⌈⌊lΦmKdV

for allq0∈L2(T). Moreover, for all R0>0there exists T=T(R0)>0such that

/⌊ar⌈⌊lq0/⌊ar⌈⌊lL2≤R0/⌊ar⌈⌊lΦmKdV
κ(t)q0−ΦmKdV
κ,N(t)q0/⌊ar⌈⌊lL2= 0. (4.3)
Proof.Let ΦmKdV
κ,N(t)q0=qlow(t)+qhigh(t). For the high frequencies, there exists a unique
global solution given by qhigh(t) =S(t)π>Nq0where the Fourier operator is deﬁned by
/hatwiderS(t)f(ξ) =e4itκ2ξ/hatwidef(ξ), for allt∈R. SinceS(t) is an isometry in L2(T), theL2-conservation
follows. For qlow, note that it satisﬁes the following Duhamel formulation
qlow(t) =S(t)πNq0−4κ3πNˆt
0S(t−t′)∂xg−(κ,qlow)(t′)dt′
and the local well-posedness in L2(T) is a consequence of the boundedness of S(t) inL2
and the Lipschitz property of g−in (2.16). Due to the smoothness of the data πNq0, the
solutions qloware also smooth. Moreover, these solutions are global-in-t ime due to the
conservation of the L2-norm, which follows from the fact that πNqlow=qlow, and (2.17).
To show (4.3), note that for q0∈L2(T), we have that

It can be proven that the quantity V(κ,q) in (1.11) is conserved under the dynamics of
anyHmKdV
κﬂow forκ≥1, at least for smooth solutions. Therefore, we expect that t he
measure ρs,Rbe invariant under any HmKdV
κdynamics. To establish this, we ﬁrst look at
the truncated dynamics HmKdV
κ,N. However, the quantity Vs(κ,πNqN), where qNdenotes
the solution of (4.2), does not appear to be conserved; see (4 .4). To bypass this diﬃculty,
we proceed as in [52, 53] and instead prove asymptotic conser vation for the truncated
dynamics. This asymptotic result is suﬃcient for our goal of establishing the invariance of
ρs,Runder the HmKdV
κdynamics.

Lemma 4.6. Fixκ≥1andt∈R. Then, for all compact sets K⊂L2(T), we have that
ˆ
KF(q)dµs=ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(K)F(q)dµs.
Proof.Fixκ≥1,t∈R, and a compact set K⊂L2(T). LetR >0 be the parameter
associated with the L2-cutoﬀ in F.
We ﬁrst show that there exists T=T(R)>0 such that for t∈[−T,T] we have
ˆ
KF(q)dµs≤ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(K)F(q)dµs. (4.9)
From Lemma 4.5 and the L1(L2(T);dµs) convergence of the densities FNin (3.24), we have
lim
N→∞ˆ
ΦmKdV
κ,N(t)(K)FN(q)dµs=ˆ
KF(q)dµs. (4.10)
We now prove a local-in-time upper bound for the left-hand si de of (4.10). From (4.3),
for ﬁxed ε >0, there exists N0∈Nsuch that for all t∈[−T,T] and all N≥N0,
ΦmKdV
κ,N(t)(K∩B(R))⊂ΦmKdV
κ(t)(K∩B(R))+B(ε). (4.11)28 A. CHAPOUTO, J. FORLANO
Note that ΦmKdV
κ,N(t)(K)∩B(R)⊆ΦmKdV
κ,N(t)(K∩B(R)). Therefore, by (4.11), we get that
for allt∈[−T,T] andN≥N0ˆ
ΦmKdV
κ,N(t)(K)FN(q)dµs=ˆ
ΦmKdV
κ,N(t)(K)∩B(R)FN(u)dµs

ΦmKdV
κ,N(t)(K∩B(R))FN(q)dµs
≤ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(K∩B(R))+B(ε)FN(q)dµs. (4.12)
Since ΦmKdV
κ(t) is a diﬀeomorphism on L2(T) andK∩B(R) is closed in L2(T), the image
ofK∩B(R) is also closed and
/intersectiondisplay
ε>0/parenleftbig
ΦmKdV
κ(t)(K∩B(R))+B(ε)/parenrightbig
= ΦmKdV
κ(t)(K∩B(R)). (4.13)
Therefore, by continuity from above of the probability meas ureµs, (4.13) and the fact that
F(q)∈L1(L2(T);dµs), it follows that
lim
ε→0ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(K∩B(R))+B(ε)F(q)dµs=ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(K∩B(R))F(q)dµs.(4.14)
Consequently, combining (4.10), (4.12), (4.14), and (3.24 ), by ﬁrsttaking a limit as N→ ∞
followed by a limit as ε→0, we obtain that for t∈[−T,T]ˆ
KF(u)dµs= lim

ΦmKdVκ(t)(K∩B(R))F(q)dµs
≤ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(K)F(q)dµs.
We now extend (4.9) to all times t∈R. Since ΦmKdV
κ(T) is a diﬀeormophism in L2(T)
and (4.9) applies to any compact set in L2(T), for all t∈[−T,T]ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(T)(K)F(q)dµs≤ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(ΦmKdVκ(T)(K))F(q)dµs=ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t+T)(K)F(q)dµs,
which combined with (4.9) extends the inequality to t∈[0,2T]. By repeating this process,
we show that the inequality holds for all t≥0. The same argument applies for t <0.
Lastly, let t∈RandKbe a compact set in L2(T). Then, /tildewideK:= ΦmKdV
κ(t)(K) is a
compact set in L2(T). Using (4.9) and the group property of ΦmKdV
κ(t), we obtainˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(K)F(q)dµs=ˆ
/tildewideKF(q)dµs≤ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(−t)(/tildewideK)F(q)dµs=ˆ
KF(q)dµs.
The equality follows by combining the above with (4.9). /square
We now prove the invariance of µsunder the HmKdV
κ-ﬂow.INVARIANT MEASURES FOR KDV AND MKDV 29
Proposition 4.7. Fixκ≥1andt∈R. Then, for all A∈ B(L2)we have thatˆ
AF(q)dµs=ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(A)F(q)dµs,
that is, the measure ρs,Ris invariant under the HmKdV
κ-ﬂow.
Proof.LetA∈ B(L2). Then, there exists a sequence of compact sets Kn⊂Asuch that
lim
n→∞ˆ
KnF(q)dµs=ˆ
AF(q)dµs.
From Lemma 4.6, we have that for all t∈R,ˆ
KnF(q)dµs=ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(Kn)F(q)dµs≤ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(A)F(q)dµs
from the inclusion ΦmKdV
κ(t)(Kn)⊂ΦmKdV
κ(t)(A). Therefore,ˆ
AF(q)dµs≤ˆ
ΦmKdVκ(t)(A)F(q)dµs.
The reverse inequality follows from the above estimate with A/ma√sto→ΦmKdV
κ(t)(A),t/ma√sto→ −t,
and from the group property of the ﬂow. /square
Proof of Theorem 1.1(iii). It suﬃces to prove (1.16) for a class of test functions which i s
dense in L1(L2(T);dµs). We thus may assume that fis continuous and bounded. By the
approximation property (2.24), dominated convergence, an d Proposition 4.7, we haveˆ
L2(T)f(ΦmKdV(t)q)dρs,R= lim
κ→∞ˆ
L2(T)f(ΦmKdV
κ(t)q)dρs,R
= lim
κ→∞ˆ
L2(T)f(q)dρs,R=ˆ
L2(T)f(q)dρs,R.
This completes the proof of (1.16). /square
We complete this section by proving Theorem 1.1(ii) on the un ion inRof the support
of the weighted measures ρs,R. We follow the argument in [52].
Proof of Theorem 1.1(ii). Note that since /⌊ar⌈⌊lq/⌊ar⌈⌊lL2<∞a.s. in the supportof themeasure µs,
we have that lim
R→∞
/BD{/⌊ar⌈⌊lq/⌊ar⌈⌊l2
L2≤R}= 1µs-a.e. Thus, by Egorov’s theorem, for all n∈N,n≥2,
there exist measurable sets Ω n⊂L2(T), and/tildewideRn>0 such that µs(Ωn) = 1−1
nand/BD{/⌊ar⌈⌊lq/⌊ar⌈⌊l2
L2≤R}= 1µs-a.e. for R >/tildewideRnandq∈Ωn. Therefore,
/uniondisplay
R>0supp( /BD{/⌊ar⌈⌊lq/⌊ar⌈⌊l2
L2≤R})⊇/uniondisplay
n≥2Ωn
and lim n→∞µs(Ωn) = 1, from which we conclude that
µs/parenleftbigg/uniondisplay
R>0supp( /BD{/⌊ar⌈⌊lq/⌊ar⌈⌊l2
L2≤R})/parenrightbigg
= 1.
Lastly, Lemma 3.7 guarantees that Eis inLp(dµs), thus the exponential component of
the density F(q) inρs,Risµs-a.s. non-zero. Combining these two results, we have that
µs/parenleftbigg/uniondisplay
R>0supp/parenleftBig/BD{/⌊ar⌈⌊lq/⌊ar⌈⌊l2
L2≤R}e−E(q)/parenrightBig/parenrightbigg
= 130 A. CHAPOUTO, J. FORLANO
and thus the union of the supports of ρs,Rwith respect to R >0 agrees with the support
of the base Gaussian measure µs. /square
4.2.Invariant measures for KdV. In this subsection, we prove Theorem 1.2.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. Fix1
2< s <1 andR >0. We ﬁrst note that by conservation of the
L2-norm and the mean, we have
ΦmKdV(t)(L2
0(T)) =L2
0(T) for all t∈R, (4.15)
and´
ΦKdV
0(t)(w0)dx= 0 for all t∈Randw0∈H−1
0(T). Thus, ΦKdV
0is well-deﬁned as a
map from L2
0(T) toH−1
0(T).
We ﬁrst prove (i). Fix f∈L1(H−1
0(T);dν0). Then, by the deﬁnition of the push-forward
measure, (4.15), and the invariance of ρ0under ΦmKdV(t) (Theorem 1.1), we have
ˆ
H−1
0(T)f(w0)dν0(w0) =ˆ
L2
0(T)f(B(q0))dρ0(q0)
=ˆ
L2(T)
/BDL2
0(T)(ΦmKdV(t)(q0))f(B◦ΦmKdV(t)(q0))dρ0(q0)

0(T)f(B◦ΦmKdV(t)(q0))dρ0(q0)
=ˆ
H−1
0(T)f(ΦKdV
0(w0))dν0(w0).
For the proof of (ii), we argue similarly noting that τ−α(H−1
α(T)) =H−1
0(T).
Lastly, we show (iii). It suﬃces to take α= 0. Note that ΦKdV
0= ΦKdV
S|H−1
0(T), where
ΦKdV
Sisthesolutionmapconstructedin[23,27]. Let w0∈H−1
0(T),q0:=B−1(w0)∈L2
0(T),
and (q0
n) be a sequence of smooth, mean-zero functions converging to q0inL2(T), such as
q0
n=πnq0. Deﬁne the sequence of smooth functions w0
n:=B(q0
n). By continuity of B,
w0
nconverges to w0inH−1(T). Letwn(t) denote the corresponding smooth solutions to
KdV. On the one hand, the results in [23, 27], imply wn(t)→ΦKdV
S(t)(w0) inH−1(T) for
eacht∈R. On the other hand, by the continuity of B, ΦKdV(t)(w0
n)→ΦKdV(t)(w0) in
H−1(T). Now, since each w0
nare smooth, wn(t) = ΦKdV(t)(w0
n) and thus we conclude that
ΦKdV(t)(w0) = ΦKdV
S(w0). /square
