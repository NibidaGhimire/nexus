Abstract
The Bayesian Hurst-Kolmogorov (HK) method estimates the Hu rst
exponent of a time series more accurately than the age-old de trended
ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA), especially when the time series is short.
However, this advantage comes at the cost of computation tim e. The
computation time increases exponentially with N, easily exceeding sev-
eral hours for N= 1024 , limiting the utility of the HK method in
real-time paradigms, such as biofeedback and brain-comput er interfaces.
To address this issue, we have provided data on the estimatio n accu-
racy of Hfor synthetic time series as a function of a priori known
values of H, the time series length, and the simulated sample size
from the posterior distribution—a critical step in the Baye sian esti-
mation method. The simulated sample from the posterior dist ribution
as small as n= 25suﬃces to estimate Hwith reasonable accuracy
for a time series as short as 256measurements. Using a larger simu-
lated sample from the posterior distribution—i.e., n >50—provides
only marginal gain in accuracy, which might not be worth trad ing oﬀ
with computational eﬃciency. We suggest balancing the simu lated sam-
ple size from the posterior distribution of Hwith the computational
resources available to the user, preferring a minimum of n= 50and
opting for larger sample sizes based on time and resource con straints.

2Bayesian method for estimating the Hurst exponent
Introduction
A robust measure of the strength of long-range correlations in tim e series
is the Hurst exponent, H, named by Mandelbrot [ 1] in honor of pioneering
work by Edwin Hurst in hydrology [ 2]. In the parlance of linear statistics, H
quantiﬁes how the measurements’ SD-like variations grow acrossprogressively
longer timescales, indicating how the correlation among sequential m easure-
ments might decay across longer separations in time. Hdescribes a single
fractal-scaling estimate of power-law decay in autocorrelation ρfor lagkas
ρk=|k+1|2H−2|k|2H+|k−1|2H, for which Hreveals the degree of persis-
tence (0.5< H <1.0; i.e., large values are typically followed by large values)
or anti-persistence (0 < H <0.5; i.e., small values typically follow large values
and vice versa).
Hhas become a central inferential statistic in diverse ﬁelds, including
meteorology [ 3–5], economics [ 6–10], ethology [ 11,12], bioinformatics [ 13–15],
and physiology [ 16–19]. In behavioral sciences, successful examples of infer-
ences made using the Hstatistic include interpretations about feedforward
and forward processes in postural control [ 20–22], system-wide coordination
[23,24], cognition [ 25–29], and perception-action [ 30–32], among countless
others.Hhas also proved to be an eﬀective measure diﬀerentiating among
adults with healthy and pathological cardiovascular functioning [ 33–35], as
well as movement systems [ 36–41].His also becoming a statistical bench-
mark for developing rehabilitative interventions [ 42–44] and quantifying the
eﬀectiveness of those interventions [ 45–47].
The most common method of estimating His detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis (DFA) [ 48,49]. DFA’s ability to assess the strength of long-range cor-
relations embedded in time series that seem non-stationary and to p revent
the false detection of long-range correlations that are a byprodu ct of non-
stationarity make it superior to many other methods. Numerical an alysis has
shown that DFA confers several advantages when the data tren d’s functional
form isnot known a priori[50,51]. Nonetheless,DFA hasseveralshortcomings
which none of the existing alternatives overcome [ 52–60]. For instance, DFA
does not accurately assess the strength of long-range correlat ions when the
time series is brief [ 54,55,59], producing a positive bias in its central tendency
in addition to a large dispersion [ 52,53,56–58,60]. DFA requires time series
consisting of at least 500 measurements to accurately estimate H, severely
limiting its application under time constraints or when collecting longer t ime
series is not practical, such as in pathological populations who canno t partic-
ipate in a study for an extended time due to fatigue [ 56]. Furthermore, DFA
is precariously sensitive to the time series length, typically overestim atingH,
a trend present in long time series but exaggerated when used with b rief time
series[53,61].
An alternative approach to estimating H—not well-known in behavioral
sciences—is a Bayesian approach used to assess the Hurst-Kolmog orov (HK)Springer Nature 2021 L ATEX template
Bayesian method for estimating the Hurst exponent 3
process in hydrology [ 62]. In this method—which we call the ”HK method,”
Tyralis and Koutsoyiannis [ 62] proposed a Bayesian-inspired technique that
deﬁnes the posterior distribution from which to sample H.
We previously compared the performance of the HK method and the DFA
using simulated and empirical time series [ 63]. Using synthetic time series with
a priori known values of H, we demonstrated that the HK method consis-
tently outperforms DFA in three ways. The HK method (i) accurate ly assesses
long-range correlations when the measurement time series is short , (ii) shows
minimal dispersion about the central tendency, and (iii) yields a point esti-
mate that does not depend on the length of the measurement time s eries or its
underlying Hurst exponent. Furthermore, comparing the two met hods using
empirical human behavioraltime series supported these simulation r esults. We
also showed that the HK method balances the Type I and Type II err ors asso-
ciated with inferential statistics performed on the estimated ˆH(We use ˆHto
distinguish the estimated value of the Hurst exponent from the gro und truth
H). It reduces the likelihood of the Type II error by not missing an eﬀe ct of
an independent factor when it exists, without increasing the likelihoo d of the
Type I error by ﬁnding an eﬀect of an independent factor when it do es not
exist. DFA nonetheless confers an advantage in computing time—ow ing to the
simple and linear nature of computations, even though these result s provide a
convincing argument for choosing the computationally-expensive H K method
over DFA. Therefore, computational eﬃciency, particularly for h igh through-
put and real-time applications, is critical to successfully implementing the HK
method.
The HK method is computationally expensive, owing to its roots in the
Bayesian framework. The computation time increases exponentially with the
time series length N. When performed on a personal computer, the computa-
tion time could easily exceed several hours for N≥1024—typical time series
length in behavioral sciences (e.g., stride interval time series, RT tim e series).
This problem becomes even more challenging when dealing with physiolog ical
measurementsrecordedoverlongertimes(e.g.,breathingrateva riability,heart
rate variability, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS ) or at higher
frequencies (e.g., the center of pressure, CoP, electroencepha logram, EEG,
electromyography, EMG). Moreover, the computational limitation makes it
impractical to implement the HK method in real-time paradigms, such a s
biofeedback and brain-computer interfaces. Computationally opt imizing the
HK method for accurately estimating H, i.e.,ˆH, is, therefore, critical for pro-
moting the adoption of the HK method as a standard approach to es timating
the Hurst exponent in behavioral sciences.
Here, we provide data on the accuracy of the Hurst exponent, es timated
using the HK method for synthetic time series as a function of a prioriknown
values of H, time series length, and the number of samples from the poste-
rior distribution of H—a parameter related to the Bayesian estimation that
critically inﬂuences the accuracy of ˆH. Our results will guide the selection ofSpringer Nature 2021 L ATEX template

Methods
The HK method for estimating the Hurst exponent
As noted above, a recently introduced Bayesian approach to estim atingH[62]
shows remarkable promise in addressing fundamental limitations with DFA.
In previous work, we have demonstrated that the HK method outp erforms
DFA in several contexts [ 63]. Our current interest is investigating the HK
method’s performance trade-oﬀs related to computational eﬃcie ncy. Results
presented later in Section 1demonstrate that the HK method is entirely accu-
rate in recovering Hfrom time series even when sacriﬁcing some accuracy
for enhanced computational eﬃciency. Below, we provide a brief ov erview of
the HK method while referring the reader to the foundational work for addi-
tional mathematical details and proofs [ 62]. Our notation generally follows
that original work.
The foundation for the method originates in the deﬁnition of the aut o-
correlation function for the so-called Hurst-Kolmogorov (HK) pro cess [64]
as:
ρk=|k+1|2H/2−2|k|2H/2+|k−1|2H, k= 0,1,..., (1)
such that His the Hurst exponent, kis the time lag, and ρkis the autocor-
relation function at each successive value of k. IfH= 0.5, thenρkis 1 when
k= 0 but zero for k >0. If 0< H <0.5, thenρkis negative at lag 1 before
damping zero when k >1. Lastly, if 0 .5< H < 1, thenρkis positive and
slowly decays towards zero; and as H→1,ρkasymptotically approaches 0.
As noted, the HK method is a Bayesian approach to estimating H[62].
In the foundational work, Tyralis & Koutsoyiannis [ 62] derived a method to
sample from the posterior distribution of Hgiven by:

tributions and serveas the backbone of implementing the HK method [66]. Let
f(x) be a probability density function (PDF) from which it is diﬃcult to sam-
ple.f(x) is the “target distribution” and can be sampled using Monte Carlo
methods. First, one samples a simpler “proposal distribution,” Mg(x) that
has the same domain as f(x) andMis a constant large enough to ensure that
g(x)≥f(x). In theory, the proposal distribution, g(x), can be any number of
distributions, such as uniform, Gaussian, exponential, etc. Howev er, the algo-
rithm gains computational eﬃciency when the overall shape of g(x) is similar
tof.Second, f(x) isevaluatedatthe valueobtainedbysampling g(x), thepro-

IfU(x)≤f(x), then the value proposedby sampling g(x) is acceptedasavalid

This process repeats until nsamples are obtained, where nis the number
of samples desired from the posterior distribution. We seek to unde rstand
appropriate values of nthat balance estimation accuracy and computational
eﬃciency.
In experiments reported in Section 1and Section 1, we employ this accept-
reject algorithm to sample Hfrom its posterior distribution (Algorithm A.5,
Robert & Casella [ 66], p. 49). The target distribution, f(x) is Eq. ( 3) and
g(x)∼Uniform (0,1).Thatuniformdistributionmakessensefor g(x) because
it sharesthe same domain of Hand hence Eq. ( 3), namely (0 ,1) [62]. A numer-
ical optimization routine is used to determine Mby ﬁnding the maximum
of Eq. (3) as a function of H. The point estimate of His then taken as the
median of the posterior distribution of H. Time series were analyzed using the
R[67] programming environment using the inferH() function as part of the
“HKprocess” package [ 68].

using the function fgnsim()from the package “fractalRegression” [ 70]. The
function fgnsim()has two inputs: the time series length, N, and the Hurst
exponent, H. We generated 1 ,000 synthetic fGn time series for each combi-
nation of six diﬀerent time series lengths ( N= 32,64,128,256,512,1024) andSpringer Nature 2021 L ATEX template

nine diﬀerent a priori known values of H(H= 0.1,0.2,...,0.9). We submit-
ted all synthetic time series to the HK method in R[67] using the function
inferH() from the package “HKprocess” [ 68]. The function inferH() has two
inputs: the time series, xN, and the simulated sample size from the posterior
distribution of H,n. The HK method was performed for a progressively larger
sample from the posterior distribution of H, covering an extensive range with
the sample size ranging from 1 to 25 with increments of 1 and from 25 t o 500
with increments of 25, i.e., n= 1,2,...,25,50,...,500.
Results
Figs.1&2provide a summary visualization of the simulation results
for each combination of the a priori known values of the Hurst exponent
(H= 0.1,0.2,...,0.9), the time series length ( N= 32,64,...,1024), and
the sample size of Hdesired from the posterior distribution of H,n=
1,2,...,25,50,...,500. As a general preview, ˆHestimated using the HK
method closely matches the actual Hfor time series containing as few as
128 values (Fig. 1, middle left). For shorter time series— N= 32,64, the HK
method visibily overestimates ˆHfor smaller actual Hand underestimates ˆH
for larger actual H(Figs.1, top left and top right, respectively). Shorter time
series—N= 32,64,128—show more closely matching values of ˆHandHfor
larger posterior samples of H. Still, this trend was not apparent for longer
time series— N= 256,512,1024(Fig. 1, middle right, bottom left, and bottom
right, respectively). Nonetheless, the sample size of Hdesired from the poste-
rior distribution does not seem to inﬂuence the ﬁdelity of ˆHfor a suﬃciently
large sample size of Hdesired from the posterior distribution, i.e., n= 50.
WhenN= 32, a very short time series compared to the DFA standard
of>500, the estimated ˆHshows a large discrepancy ( >0.1) with the actual
Hin terms of the absolute error (Fig. 2, top left). Although this discrepancy
sharply reduced with the sample size of Hdesired from the posterior distri-
bution, almost reaching an asymptote by n= 25, the absolute error remains
considerably high even for n= 500. For a relatively longer yet considerably
short time series— N= 64, the absolute error reduces with the sample size of
Hdesired from the posterior distribution, reaching a lower asymptot ic value
of<0.1 (Fig.2, top right). However, this discrepancy is still suﬃcient to mask
thetypicallyobserveddiﬀerencesintheHurstexponentofempirica ltimeseries
across two groups. For instance, the Hurst exponent of stride- to-stride interval
time series during walking shows a diﬀerence of the order of 0.1 acros s vari-
ous task conditions(e.g., [ 42–44]. However, a discrepancy of the order of 0.1 in
the estimation of Hcan potentially mask these diﬀerences, resulting in false
negatives in statistical tests. The trend was comparable for time s eries with
N= 124 except for the absolute error reaching a lower asymptotic va lue of
∼0.05 (Fig. 2, middle left).Springer Nature 2021 L ATEX template

Discussion
The HK method oﬀers several advantages over DFA in estimating th e Hurst
exponent of a time series [ 63]. However, these advantages come at the cost of
computation time. The HK method is computationally expensive owing t o its
roots in the Bayesian framework. Computationally optimizing the HK m ethod
for accurately estimating ˆHis, therefore, critical for promoting the adoption
of the HK method over DFA for estimating the Hurst exponent in beh av-
ioral sciences. To address this issue, we have provided data on the accuracy of
the Hurst exponent estimated using the HK method for synthetic t ime series
as a function of a priori known values of H, the time series length, and the
sample size of Hfrom the posterior distribution of H—a parameter related
to the Bayesian estimation that critically inﬂuences the accuracy of ˆHand
computation time. The simulated sample from the posterior distribut ion ofH
as small as n= 50 suﬃces to estimate the Hurst exponent with reasonable
accuracy. Using a larger simulated sample from the posterior distrib ution of
H—i.e.,n >50—provides only a marginal gain in accuracy, which might not
be worth trading oﬀ with computational eﬃciency. We suggest balan cing the
simulated sample size from the posterior distribution of Hwith the compu-
tational resources available to the user, preferring a minimum of n= 50 and
opting for larger sample sizes based on time and resource constrain ts. Our
results allow the reader to make such judgments.
Empiricaldataposeseveralotherissuesthatmightunderminethe accuracy
ofHestimated using the HK method, such as strong trends [ 71–73], nonsta-
tionarities [ 71,74], and “crossovers”—i.e., when correlations do not follow the
samescalinglawforalltimescalesandacrossoverisobservedbetwe endiﬀerent
scaling regions [ 49,50,75,76]. However, because these anomalies, particularly
the crossovers, often appear at longer timescales, it seems reas onable to pro-
mote the systematic use of this method, irrespective of these res erves. Future
work could investigate how trends, nonstationarities, and crosso vers inﬂuence
the estimation accuracy using the Bayesian approach.
In summary, the HK method oﬀers several advantages over DFA f or esti-
mating the Hurst exponent of a time series, especially when it is short . What
may prevent, however, the adoption of the HK method is signiﬁcant ly long
computation time, especially when analyzing time series containing sev eral
hundred tothousands ofmeasurements—whichis frequentlythe c asein behav-
ioral sciences. To minimize the computation time of the HK method, we have
provided critical information for identifying the minimum simulated sam ple
from the posterior distribution of H. This information could aid the selection
of correct parametersthat allow the estimation of Hin real-time settings, such
as biofeedback paradigms and brain-computer interfaces, where computation
time is often limited.
