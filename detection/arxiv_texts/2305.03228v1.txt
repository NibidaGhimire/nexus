We report on the design and numerical simulation of a tuna ble, near -infrared (NIR) femtosecond noncollinear optical 
parametric amplifier (OPA) seeded by  a nonlinear fiber amplifier operating in the parabolic and gain -managed regime.  
With  microjoule -level pump pulses in the visible, we achieved amplification bandwidths of signal and idler pulses 
between 10 10-1170 nm and 9 20-1050 nm, respectively , and whose second harmonics correspond to the visible range 
between ~4 60-585  nm.  The estimated quantum efficiency for the conversion of the pump to signal and idler pulses 
combined was greater than 15%. This appreciable value in a single OPA stage is due to the high spectral energy density of 
the fiber -amplified broadband pulse  - about  30 times grea ter in the 1 μm range when compared to white -light continuum 
(WLC) pulses, which are often used to seed commercial OPAs . When  combined with  their excellent  spatial beam qualit y 
and full coherence  across their entire bandwidth , fiber -amplified pulses enabl e more efficient engineering and 
application of OPAs  in the visible and NIR . 
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
Optical parametric amplifi ers (OPA) are powerful tools that  
produce  light of variable wavelengths  and ultrashort pulse 
durations  from a n otherwise  fixed -wavelength laser source  [1,2]  
Wavelength tunability is  important , for example,  in spectroscopy, 
where light is used to excite  and probe  the different  energy 
transitions  of a sample of interest . OPAs  in the visible and near -
infrared (NIR) have been employed for  imaging deep tissues 
through multi -photon microscopy [3–5], for imaging blood flow 
through in vivo  tracking of harmonic particles in living animals [6], 
for probing ultrafast exciton and phonon dynamics in quantum 
materials [7], and for studying charge photogeneration and 
recombination in solar cells via time -resolved transient absorption 
spectroscopy measurements [8]. Improving every amplification 
stage is paramount to visible and NIR OPAs.  
      The OPA process begins with the generation of the initial signal, 
namely the seed . The generation scheme and attributes of the seed 
dictate many of the performance parameters of the OPA. One such  
important  factor is the number of seed photons . A higher number  of 
photons  allows for efficient  saturation, especially in the 
noncollinear OPA (NOPA) configuration , translating  to higher 
output energy stabilities [9,10] . Too low of a photon count in the 
spectral region to be amplified could induce significant shot -to-shot 
energy fluctuations [10]. Most commercial ultrafast OPAs use a 
white light  generated (WLG ) seed  that spectrally extend s from the visible to the NIR . Such a pulse  is produced by fo cusing an intense  
ultrashort  seed pulse  inside a bulk laser host material . Through the 
filamentation process stemming from multiple nonlinear effects  
such as self -focusing, multiphoton ionization, self -phase 
modulation ( SPM ), and self -steepening [1,11] , the spectral range  of 
the initial pulse is stretched.  However, the se multiple nonlinear 
processes contribute to OPA noise . Though  WLG continuum can 
exhibit an appreciable pulse -to-pulse energy stability [9,12] , typical 
spectral energy densities of the WLG continuum pulse are limited, 
e.g. 10-30 pJ/nm in the visible and NIR range for white -light 
generated in YAG and sapphire crystals [9]. In the near ultraviolet 
(UV) range , using CaF 2 disks, higher pulse energies were obtained 
and used to seed a NOPA [10], though these disks need to be 
continuously moved to avoid cumulative photodamage  [13]. 
Further, a t high  input energies, filamentation  results in  the emission  
of a chromatic conical ring [1,12,14 –16], requir ing additional spatial 
filtering to clean the spatial beam profile .  
     Despite its broad bandwidth, the light in the spectral region 
surrounding the initial seed  is incoherent and  unsuitable for usage, 
especially in an OPA [9,17] .  In this region, due to SPM , the chirp  of 
the pulse  greatly increases, causing the spectrum to be  highly 
complex as opposed to being nearly flat  [9,17,18] . This  significant ly 
reduces the energy of  a WLG OPA seed  as a large portion of  the 
original white light seed energy is contained in this spectral region  
[1].      While the bulk of  earlier WL G studies were based on Ti:sapp hire 
laser systems, Yb -lasers show  emerging  potential for  efficient WLG 
in the visible [19], and mid -IR [20], albeit still exhibiting low pulse 
energy [19]. When combined with energetic pump pu lses 
generated from Yb -based  laser systems, OPAs can scale 
dramatically in output energy [1] and can deliver significant 
amplification bandwidths in the noncollinear geometry  [21] or at 
degeneracy [22], as well as providing hi gh gain in a few mm crystal 
[23]. The small quantum defect of Yb atoms , when pumped at 940 
or 980 nm and lasing at 1030 nm, reduces thermal problems 
[24,25] . Compared to Ti:sapphire laser sources, which have 
relatively limited average powers, Yb -doped materials can handle 
high er average power operations, permitting repetition rates above 
tens of kHz  and higher energy stability . This is especially desirable 
in experiments that require averaging over multiple shots , high 
acquisition speeds , and/or high  average power but low energies 
per pulse .

profile of the seed pulse, centered at t = 0 and x = 0. (d) Spectral intensity (black 
solid) and phase (red dashed) of the fiber -amplified pulse.   
 
     As an alternative to WLG , we propose using a  broadband  OPA 
seed source with high spectral energy density that can be generated 
directly from a  1030 nm pulse derived from a high -power, high 
repetition rate Yb -laser . By exploit ing a notable advance ment  in 
nonlinear fiber amplification , i.e., gain-managed nonlinear (GMN) 
amplification  in Yb -doped fibers  [26,27] , we demo nstrate that 
GMNs substantially support the production of broadband pulses with spectral energy densities 20 times higher that WLG, thus 
reducing filamentation -induced white  light noise in  OPAs . Unlike 
WLG, the resulting smoothly broadened spectra surround  the initial 
1030 nm fiber -amplified seed pulse. In addition, fiber pulses offer 
high -quality and uniform  spatiotemporal mode profiles, in contrast 
to the chromatic ring structure observed from filamentation [10].  
     In this study, we present numerical simulations of a tunable 
NOP A pumped by the second harmonic of a Yb -laser system  and 
seeded by fiber -amplified pulses  generated inside a  Yb-fiber 
amplifier ( Fig. 1 .a).  We obtained signal and idler pulses ranging 
from 10 26 to 11 44 nm, and 9 37 to 10 35 nm, respectively, for which 
the se cond harmonics correspond to the visible  (Fig. 1b) . The 
resulting signal pulses exhibit excellent  spatiotemporal beam 
qualities suitable for application -based use, further  staged 
amplification , or for pulse shaping . More notably, in  a single OPA 
stage, we achieve quantum efficiencies estimated to be greater than  
16%, with signal and idler pulse energies each around 0.6 μJ when  
pumped by 3 μJ 515 nm light. Such a high conversion efficiency  is 
made possible by the increased spectral energy density of the fiber -
amplified  seed . 
2. FIBER PULSE AMPLIFICATION  
Recent  results have shown that double -clad Yb -gain fiber 
amplifiers can generate chirped picosecond pulses with 
bandwidths supporting sub -30 fs compressed pulse 
durations, with pulse energies up to the microjoule level  
[26,27] .  These pulses are generated by controlled nonlinear 
amplification acting in concert with a red -shifting gain 
spectrum .  The launched seed pulses initially amplify in the 
self-similar regime, growing in bandwid th, temporal 
duration and energy while maintaining a parabolic temporal 
profile and a linear chirp.   As the co -propagating pump light 
gradually depletes, the quasi -three -level nature of the Yb -
gain spectrum causes the center of the gain bandwidth to red -
shift.   The pulse no longer amplifies self -similarly, but in this 
gain -managed regime, the amplification still contains several 
important qualities – a smooth temporal envelope, linear 
chirp, and spectral broadening with a spectral profile that 
lacks the e xtreme undulations of typical SPM -dominated 
nonlinear propagation [26,27].   These properties enable the 
energetic output pulse to immediately provide a high -quality 
seed for an OPA.   
     To physically model nonlinear pulse propagation in the 
fiber ampli fier, we used the  generalized nonlinear 
Schrödinger equation (GNLSE), which models the evolution 
of the c omplex electric field envelope as it propagates along 
the fiber length [28,29] . The GNLSE was numerically 
implemented with the split -step propagator method, where 
nonlinearities such as SPM, self -steepening, and the 
stimulated Raman effect are handled in the temporal domain , 
while dispersion and gain are applied  linearly  in the spectral 
domain .  Gain was modeled using the rate equations for a 
two-level system [30] .  Wavelength -dependent absorption 
and emission cross -sections were used to compute the gain 
spectrum at each step along the gain fiber length.  
     The fiber chain consisted of three components  – a 2m long 
passive segment, a 3m long double -clad gain fibe r, and a 
15cm passive fiber .   The passive fibers were also double -clad 
so that 976nm pump laser light could co-propagate in the 
multimode core .   A 10/125 core/cladding geometry was 
used to simulate Liekki’s Yb1200 -10/125DC -PM gain fiber 
and the matching passive fiber P-10/125DC -PM.  A 0.5nJ 
Gaussian  pulse centered at  1030 nm with a 4.5nm spectral 
width is launched into the fiber chain and  is reshaped into a 
parabolic profile through SPM  in the first fiber section.  Upon 
entering the gain fiber, it i nitially undergoes self -similar ( or 
shape -preserving) amplification, where the combined 
interplay of gain, SPM, and dispersion allow the pulse to grow 
in energy,  bandwidth, and duration  while  maintaining its 
parabolic profil e [27,31] .    The nonlinear amplification then 
moves into the gain -managed regime, characterized by a red -
shift in the gain spectrum.  Finally, a short piece of passive 
fiber terminated with a fiber connector generates additional 
spectral broadening.  Compared to SPM -generated 
bandwidths in passive fiber, the output from the GMN 
amplifie r exhibits a  relatively smooth spectral envelope 
between 10 20 and 1 170 nm.   The simulated pulse 
spatiotemporal profile and spectrum after exiting the fiber 
chain are shown in Fig. 1( b) and 1( c), respectively. Th e pulse 
has a total energy of 152 nJ and a  nominal  spectral energy 
density of about 600 pJ/nm across the middle of the 
spectrum , which is nominally 30 times greater than that of 
WLG pulses .  
3. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
We perform simulations in Chi 2D, a nonlinear pulse propagation 
code  that implements a 2+1-dimensional – in (x, z) space and time  – 
Fourier split -step algorithm , and accounts  for dispersion , diffraction , 
and walk -off in birefringent crystals  [32]. Chi2D allows for arbitrary 
pulse profile  inputs  by loading their spectra and phase data. The 
program outputs the complex electric field amplitudes of the 
ordinary and extraordinary fields.  The nonlinear material 
considered was a 1-mm long Type -I β-barium borate ( BBO ), which 
is suitable for high average power operations because of its  superior 
thermal properties and small  linear absorption coefficients (10-4-
10-2 cm-1 in the  ~0.5 -1 μm wavelength region ) [33,34] . All 
geometrical values presented here  were selected to  produce signal 
pulses that have  a full-width -half-maximum (FWHM)  spec tral 
bandwidth  of around 14-17 nm (~120-1340 cm-1) at ~1.02-1.15 
μm, which can  be easily further stretched or compressed , 
depending on the requirements . The crystal length was  chosen 
based on commercial availability and considering with an upper 
boundary that  too long of a crystal can result in temporal and spatial 
walk -off due to the different group velocities of  all pulses in the 
nonlinear configuration . The length of BBO is less than the 
maximum pulse splitting length for the signal and pump . The 
effective nonlinear optical coefficient  was set to 2 pm/V , consistent 
with reported data  [2]; this is a comparably high value , allowing for 
high single -pass gain  [33]. The wavevector of the extraordinarily ( e) 
polarized  pump propagates along the z-axis, at the phase -matching 
angle,  θ, relative to the  optic axis (OA)  (Fig. 1 .a). The pump  is 
modeled as a 200-fs transform -limited Gaussian pulse having 3 μJ 
total energy and 515 nm  center wavelength , which  can be  produced 
from the second harmonic generation (SHG) of commercially 
available 6-W-level  Yb-laser  amplifiers  at 1 MHz repetition rate , 
assuming 50% SHG conversion efficiency .  The output spectral and 
phase data from the fiber pulse amplification propagator described 
above  was input as the seed  pulse in Chi2D . Both pulses were 
assumed to have Gaussian spatial profile s with  1/e2 radii  of 0.11 mm, corresponding  to pump peak intensity of 74  GW/cm2. The 
signal range covers the degeneracy wavelength of 1030 nm at 
which both signal and idler photons emerge.  The spatial  separation 
of the two  o-polarized pulses was achieved by employing a non -
collinear geometry, with the initial seed propagating at a n angle  
know n as the pump -tilt angle,  αs, relative to the pump . Note that  we 
refer to the signal pulse as the puls e that propagates along the same 
direction of the initial seed , and the idler as the generated pulse .  
     Wavelength tunability  was accomplished by varying the pump -
seed group delay, τ GD, which adjusts the overlap  in time  between  the 
pump and the  different spectral regions of broadband seed, 
separated because of temporal chirp  (Fig. 2a) . To ensure  near -
perfect phase -matching with the wavelength  to be amplified, we 
simultaneously adjusted the phase -matching angle θ. By increasing 
the pump group delay from -1400 to 1500  fs, we amplified signal 
wavelengths between 1026 and 11 44 nm. Outside of this range, 
sidebands appear in the signal spectrum. Phase -matching angles for 
fixed α s can be found in SNLO [35], which was further tuned  to 
improve the quality of the spatiotemporal profile of the signal pulse. 
For the group delay range given above, the phase -matching angle 
decreased from θ=25. 17° to θ=24. 72°. Variations in the phase -
matching  angle by ± 0.2° did not significantly affect the signal spectra 
or spatiotemporal profile s. The corresponding pump walk -off 
angles are between 3.43° and 3.4 8°.  To increase the spatial overlap 
between the pump and the signal  Poynting vector s inside the 
crystal , we fixed the pump -signal angle to be αs = 3.5° , close to the 
spatial walk -off angle s of the pump .

FWHM spectral bandwidth of the resulting signal (blue circle) and idler (red

     The resulting signal p ulse bandwidths at FWHM ranged from 1 4 
nm at 10 39 nm to 17 nm at 1 144 nm (Fig. 2b , blue circles ). The 
shortest pulse duration at FWHM was 1 40 fs at the center 
wavelength of 1 026 nm, and the longest duration  was 1 63 fs at 
1087 nm. The time bandwidth products of the pulses were 0. 558 at 
1026 nm and 0.6 66 at 1087 nm, more than the bandwidth -limited 
value of 0.44, assuming a Gaussian temporal pulse profile, which 
can be caused by the angular dispersion of the signal. For the idler 
pulses, the bandwidths were smaller, the smallest being 1 0 nm 
between 937 and 9 57 nm wavelength, and the largest, 1 4 nm for at 
1011 nm wavelength (Fig. 2 .b, red triangles ).

     An example of the resulting pulses for τ GD = -800 fs and θ =2 5.1° 
which amplified a center wavelength of 10 50 nm, is shown in Fig 3. a. 
The spatiotemporal profiles of the signal and idler are shown in 
Fig. 3.a and b, respectively. The slopes  of intensity profiles in 
different domains reflect first -order distortions  [36]. The pulse 
front tilt angle is characteriz ed by the slope of the profile in the ( x, t) 
domain at the centers of the spatial and temporal profile . The 
resulting signal pulses exhibit no pulse -front tilt, but the idler pulses 
have  a slight pulse -front  tilt of around 3 °. Pulse front tilt can also 
arise from angular dispersion . Typically, in a NOPA setup, the idler 
presents a large spectral angular dispersion [2], but here t he signal 
is more angularly dispersed than the idle r. As can be seen from the 
slopes of the intensity profiles in the ( fx, ft) domains (Fig. 3 .c and d) 
and the spectral intensity profile (Fig. 3 .e, solid blue ), there are residual spectral compo nents from the signal between 1075 -1200 
nm. The corresponding spectral intensity and phase, and group 
delays are shown in Fig. 3 .e and f, respectively.  Slices across x and t 
at the center of gravity of the pulse are shown in Fig. 3 .g and h. Both 
the signal and idler pulses have a nearly Gaussian temporal profile, 
but the spatial profile along x appears to be skewed, especially for 
the idler pulse .  
     Assuming that the transverse radii in the pump at the end of the 
crystal length are equal, t ypical energies transferred to both the 
signal and the idler from the pump was slightly greater than  30%  of 
the initial pump energy for all  cases studied , which correspon ds to 
signal and idler pulses around 0.5 μJ. The ratio between the input 
pump photons and the output signal photons is a good measure of 
amplification efficiency ; in our case, the calculatio ns render a  ~16% 
conversion of pump photons to signal and idler photons  combined .  
3. CONCLUSIONS  
We present ed numerical simulations of a fiber -amplified parabolic 
pulse used for seeding an OPA  that is based on commercially 
available 6-W-level  Yb-laser  amplifiers  operating at around 1 MHz 
repetition rate . With  3 μJ pump pulse  energies  at 515  nm, 
approximately 16% of pump photons were converted to signal and 
idler photons combined.  By virtue of the high spectral e nergy 
density and smoothly broadband shape of our seed pulse, we 
achieve high conversion efficiency in a single amplification stage 
when pumping at sub -microjoule pulse energies. The spectral 
bandwidth s of the signal and idler pulses were less than ~140 cm-1 
and the average pulse duration  was 156 fs. We were able to achieve 
broad signal and idler wavelength tunability between 10 26-1170 
nm and 9 20-1051 nm, respectively. To meet the demands of 
applications requiring higher pulse energies and power , the 
resulting pulses can be further amplified in subsequent OPA stages . 
Further, to extend to the  visible  spectral range , the amplified signal 
and idler pulses can undergo  second -harmonic generation, where 
the wavelengths span  505-585 nm and 460-525 nm, respectively . 
However, at higher optical powers, OPA performance degrades  due 
to absorption within  the nonlinear crystal . Therefore, it is important 
to mitigate the effects of abso rption -based heating, which could  
limit attainable power, spectral bandwidth , and beam quality [33]. 
When combined with proper thermal management techniques  and 
design , the resulting energetic pulses produced from a tunable Yb-
based OPA  system  seeded by a broadband , spectrally dense  GMN -
amplified  parabolic pulse  could have numerous uses in ultrafast 
spectroscopy applications  that favor high repetition  rates and high 
energy  pulses consistent across the visible and near -IR; for example,  
in neuroscience, biophysics, solid -state physics, and photovoltaics, 
where Yb -based OPA systems are currently being employed .
