Abstract. In this study, cosmological models are considered, where dark matter and dark
energy are coupled and may exchange energy through non-gravitational interactions with
one other. These interacting dark energy (IDE) models have previously been introduced to
addressproblemswiththestandard ΛCDMmodelofcosmology(whichincludethecoincidence
problem, Hubble tension and S8discrepancy). However, conditions ensuring positive energy
densities have often been overlooked. Assuming two different linear dark energy couplings,
Q=δHρ deandQ=δHρ dm, we find that negative energy densities are inevitable if energy
flows from dark matter to dark energy (iDMDE regime) and that consequently, we should
only seriously consider models where energy flows from dark energy to dark matter (iDEDM
regime). To additionally ensure that these models are free from early time instabilities,
we need to require that dark energy is in the ‘phantom’ ( ω <−1) regime. This has the
consequence that model Q=δHρ dmwill end with a future big rip singularity, while Q=
δHρ demay avoid this fate with the right choice of cosmological parameters.

– 1 –1 Introduction
The expansion of the universe has thus far been well described by the ΛCDM model, where
the energy budget of the universe is divided between ≈5%baryonic matter (standard model
particles), ≈25%non-baryonic cold dark matter (which keeps galaxies from flying apart)
and≈70%dark energy in the form of the cosmological constant Λ(which explains late-time
accelerated expansion). This model has proven to be a very successful fit for astrophysical
observations [1–5], but problems with the ΛCDM model remain, which include:
•The Cosmological Constant Problem or vacuum catastrophe, refers to the measured
energy density of the vacuum being over 120orders of magnitude smaller than the
theoretical prediction. This has been referred to as the worst prediction in the history
of physics and casts doubt on dark energy being a cosmological constant [6, 7].
•The Cosmic Coincidence Problem , which alludes to the dark matter and dark energy
densities having the same order of magnitude at the present moment while differing with
many orders of magnitude in the past and predicted future [8–12]. The initial conditions
of dark matter and dark energy should be fine-tuned to about 95orders of magnitude
to produce a universe where the two densities nearly coincide today, approximately 14
billion years later [13].
•The Hubble Tension , which concerns the ∼5σlevel difference between values of the
Hubbleconstant H0asmeasuredfromtheCosmicMicrowaveBackground(CMB)versus
the value obtained from Type Ia Supernovae using a calibrated local distance ladder
[1, 14–26].
•TheS8discrepancy , which concerns the 3σlevel difference between measurements made
from the CMB against weak lensing measurements and redshift surveys of the param-
eterS8, which quantifies the amplitude of late-time matter fluctuations and structure
growth. [24–29].
These problems motivate research into new physics beyond the ΛCDM model. A popular
approach to solving these problems has been to investigate cosmological models in which there
are non-gravitational interactions between the dark sectors of the universe. This allows the
two dark sectors to exchange energy (and/or momentum) while dark matter (DM) and dark
energy (DE) are not separately conserved, but the energy (and momentum) of the total dark
sector is conserved instead. These models are broadly known as interacting dark energy (IDE)
models. Inthesemodels, weassumethatbothradiationandbaryonicmatterisuncoupledand
separately conserved since there are strong ’fifth-force’ observational constraints on baryonic
matter[30]andanynewsignificantinteractionswithphotonswouldprobablycausedeviations
from photons following a geodesic path [11]. We, therefore, have the following conservation
equations for interacting dark energy models:
˙ρdm+ 3Hρdm=Q ; ˙ ρde+ 3Hρde(1 +ω) =−Q ,
˙ρbm+ 3Hρbm= 0 ; ˙ ρr+ 3Hρr(1 + 1 /3) = 0 ,(1.1)
where His the Hubble parameter, ρis the energy density, and the subscripts denote radiation
(r), baryonic matter (bm), dark matter (dm) and dark energy (de). Here we still assume
pressure-less dark matter ( Pdm= 0→ωdm= 0), and note that baryonic matter ωbm= 0
and radiation ωr= 1/3are uncoupled Q= 0, as in the ΛCDM model. The dark energy
– 2 –equation of state ( ωde=ωfrom here onwards) is left as a free variable since the dark energy
may be either vacuum energy ( ω=−1), in the quintessence ( −1< ω < −1/3) or phantom
(ω <−1) regime. Here Qis an arbitrary coupling function whose sign determines how energy
(or momentum) is transferred between dark energy and dark matter. If Q > 0, then the
energy (or momentum) is transferred from dark energy to dark matter and vice versa for
Q <0, such that [11, 12, 20, 27, 31–38]:
Q=

>0Dark Energy →Dark Matter (iDEDM regime)
<0Dark Matter →Dark Energy (iDMDE regime)
= 0No interaction .(1.2)
Here we have denoted the interacting case where energy flows from dark energy to dark mat-
ter (Q >0) as the interacting Dark Energy Dark Matter regime (iDEDM), and vice versa as
the interacting Dark Matter Dark Energy regime (iDMDE) [27]. Since there is currently no
fundamental theory for the coupling equation Q, the coupling in most works is purely phe-
nomenologically motivated; and must be tested against observations [11, 12, 20, 27, 31–38].
The coupling is thus freely chosen, but we will only consider models where the coupling func-
tionQis either proportional to the dark matter or the dark energy density, which could have
a strong field theoretical ground [39]. The core publications we considered for these models
are [32–34]. For recent developments and observational constraints, see [19, 20, 25–28, 35–39];
and for comprehensive review articles on interacting dark energy, see [11, 12].
IDE models were firstintroduced to address the coincidence problem [8–12], but this approach
has recently become less popular due to observational constraints on the interaction strength
needed to solve this problem significantly. Instead, in recent years these models have received
more attention as possible candidates to alleviate the Hubble tension [19–26] and have most
recently been shown also to alleviate the S8discrepancy while making an excellent fit to the
latest cosmological data available [24–28].
Even though IDE models have proven to be popular candidates to address the biggest prob-
lems in cosmology, we believe that the parameter space in the most popular model is often
not well understood as conditions to ensure positive energy densities and to avoid a future
big rip are often ignored. We would like to clarify this. New results that we obtained will be
shown in italics to clearly differentiate from previously known results . In this article:
•We clarify the general cosmological implications of IDE models for any interaction Q
(summarised in table 1).
•We derive a new equation (2.17) that may be used to easily obtain phase portraits for
the evolution of dark matter and dark energy densities (figure 1), which applies to any
interaction Qwithout the need to solve the conservation equation (1.1) , which may be
excessively difficult for most interaction functions.
•We analyze the most popular IDE model where the interaction is proportional to the
dark energy density Q=δHρ de. For this model, we will derive the viability condition
0< δ < −3ω/(1 +1
r0)(3.18) to avoid negative energy densities, which is the most
important result of this paper, as this is nearly always ignored in the literature and
shows that negative energy densities are inevitable if energy flows from dark matter to
dark energy (iDMDE regime) and that consequently, we should only seriously consider
models where energy flows from dark energy to dark matter (iDEDM regime) . Most
– 3 –of the rest of the paper is dedicated to clarifying previous results of this model while
showing how this negative energy problem is always present for the iDMDE regime’s
future expansion.
•For this model, we show that the iDEDM regime may alleviate the coincidence problem
for the past expansion while solving the coincidence problem for the future expansion,
as seen in 3.27 and figure 2. Conversely, the iDMDE regime is shown only to worsen the
coincidence problem. This result is well known, but as an application of the previous
point, we included newly extended plots for the future expansion which clearly show
negative values of r, indicating negative energy densities. The way we have related
the effective equations of state ωeff
dmandωeff
deto various parameters in this section and
throughout the rest of the paper are not new results, but rather a newly suggested
formulation for analyzing familiar problems and results more clearly.
•We clarify the additional cosmological consequences of the iDEDM and iDMDE regime
for this model, using imposed parameters for the sake of clarity. We show how the
coupling influences the evolution of the energy densities (figure 3 and 4), the total fluid
effective equation of state (figure 5), deceleration parameter (figure 6), the expansion
rate (figure 7), and the age of the universe (figure 8). Most of these results have been
shown before, but we included newly extended plots for the future expansion clearly
showing how negative dark matter energy densities plague all these previously known
results for the iDMDE regime.
•We derived newanalytical expressions for theredshiftwherethe radiation-matter z(r=dm+bm)
(3.28) and matter-dark energy z(dm+bm=de) (3.29) equalities occur as well the transition
redshift zt(3.31) where accelerated expansion starts, known as the cosmic jerk. These
results, with the imposed parameters, are summarised in tables 3, 4 and 5.
•We show that to ensure that this model is not only free from negative energy densities
but also free from early time instabilities, we need to require that dark energy is in the
‘phantom’ ( ω <−1) regime, as shown in table 6. This has the consequence that these
universe models will end with a future big rip singularity (figure 9) unless the effective
equation of state is ωeff
de=ω+δ
3>−1. The results from table 6 and equation (3.40) give
the most useful theoretical constraints on parameters for other researchers who want to
constrain these models with new observational data. A new equation (3.38), which gives
the exact time of this big rip, has also been derived .
•We briefly summarise the same results above for the interaction function Q=δHρ dm.
Here the positive energy density condition 0< δ < −3ω
(1+r0)(3.45) and table 8 sum-
marises the most useful theoretical constraints for this model. The negative energy
densities and the inevitable big rip for this model are well known, thus all results in this
section may be considered as only new formulations of known results .Equation (3.49)
giving the time of this big rip is the only new result .
– 4 –2 Properties of interacting dark energy models
2.1 Background cosmology and its implications
In IDE cosmology, the standard assumptions of isotropy and homogeneity of the universe, as
characterised by the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, still hold. At
the same time, only the conservation equations are modified, changing the evolution of the
DM and DE density profiles. This implies that the standard ΛCDM equations may be used,
which include those for the Friedmann equation, the deceleration parameter and the total
effective equation of state, respectively:
H2(a) =˙a

2Ωde(1 + 3 ω), (2.2)
ωeff=Ptot
ρtot=1
3Ωr+ωdeΩde
Ωr+ Ω bm+ Ω dm+ Ω de, (2.3)
where ωdm=ωbm= 0andωr= 1/3. The crucial difference in the behaviour of IDE models
may be understood by how the interaction affects the effective equations of state of both dark
matter ωeff
dmand dark energy ωeff
de, relative to the uncoupled background equations ( Q= 0) in
(1.1) such that [12, 32, 33]:
ωeff
dm=−Q
3Hρdm; ωeff
de=ωde+Q
3Hρde. (2.4)
Thus, the effects of an interaction may be understood to imply that if [12, 32, 33]:
Q >0(iDEDM)(
ωeff
dm<0Dark matter redshifts slowerthan a−3(less DM in past) ,
ωeff
de> ω deDark energy has lessaccelerating pressure ,
(2.5)
Q <0(iDMDE)(
ωeff
dm>0Dark matter redshifts fasterthan a−3(more DM in past) ,
ωeff
de< ω deDark energy has moreaccelerating pressure .
(2.6)
This implies that even if ωde=−1, when Q <0orQ >0, then the dark energy may behave
like either uncoupled quintessence ωeff
de>−1or uncoupled phantom ωeff
de<−1dark energy
respectively. If there is no interaction between dark matter and dark energy (Q= 0), the
effective equations of state reduce back to the uncoupled model, such that ωeff
dm=ωdm= 0
andωeff
de=ωde.
These effective equations of state allow us to make predictions regarding the consequences of a
dark coupling; and why it was initially introduced to address the cosmic coincidence problem.
This can be seen by considering the ratio rIDEofρdmtoρdefrom (1.1) for interacting dark
energy models:
rIDE=ρdm
ρde=ρ(dm,0)a−3(1+ωeff

ρ(de,0)a−3(1+ωeff

with ζindicating the magnitude of the coincidence problem. Thus, from (2.7), we see that
the smaller the difference between ωeff
dmandωeff
dethe more the coincidence problem will be
– 5 –alleviated while being solved if ζ= 0, which happens when ωeff
dm=ωeff
de. This can be achieved
if dark matter redshifts slower ωeff
dm< ω dmand dark energy redshifts faster ωeff
de> ω de, which
coincides with the iDEDM ( Q > 0) scenario. The opposite holds for the iDMDE ( Q < 0)
scenario. From (2.5),(2.6) and (2.7), while noting that ζΛCDM = 3, we may conclude:
ζIDE= 3

(2.8)
Besides addressing the coincidence problem, IDE models have other far-reaching cosmological
consequences. Since ωeff
dm<0for iDEDM, DM redshifts slower, which leads to lessDM in the
past and the radiation-matter equality happening later[33], which in turns causes suppression
in the matter power spectrum, alleviating theS8discrepancy [27] (see [24–28] for how IDE
models address the S8tension). Similarly, ωeff
de> ω de, such that DE redshifts faster, causing
moreDE in the past. Less DM and more DE in the past have the consequence that both
the cosmic jerk and the matter-dark energy equality happen earlierin cosmic history. From
the Friedmann equation (2.1), we can see that this overall suppression of dark matter density
causes a lower value of the Hubble parameter at late times. This lower value of H0worsens
the Hubble tension with regard to late time probes [27] (see [20–26] for how IDE models
address the Hubble tension). Since the Hubble parameter, and therefore the expansion rate,
is lower throughout most of the expansion, the universe must have taken longer to reach its
current size. Since more time was needed to reach current conditions, the universe should
also beolder. The opposite holds for the iDMDE scenario. These general consequences of a
dark sector coupling (if all other parameters are kept constant), are summarised in table 1.

Cosmic jerk ( q= 0) Earlier ( zIDE> zΛCDM)Later ( zIDE< zΛCDM)

These implications will only hold if the IDE model is viable. Any cosmological model may be
considered unviable due to theoretical concerns, such as internal inconsistencies, instabilities
or negative energy densities. A model free of these problems can only be deemed viable if it
meets observational constraints, such as predicting an expansion history that coincides with
the most recent cosmological data. This paper will only consider theoretical constraints, while
we refer readers to [19–28, 35–39] for observational constraints.
– 6 –2.2 Instabilities and the doom factor
The coupling between the dark sectors will influence the evolution of dark matter and dark
energy perturbations. A complete perturbation analysis of the models considered in the
paper is found in [32] and [33]. For our purposes, we only want to know what combination of
parameters may be used to avoid instabilities. This can be found in [33], by introducing the
so-called doom factor d:
d=Q
3Hρde(1 +ω). (2.9)
This is called the doom factor since this factor is proportional to the coupling function Qand
may induce non-adiabatic instabilities in the evolution of the dark energy perturbations [33].
The sign of dwill determine if there is an early time instability. It was shown that if the doom
factor is positive and large d>1; the dark energy perturbations will become dominated by
the terms which are dependent on the coupling function Q, leading to a runaway; unstable
growth regime [33]. As long as d<0, the model should be free of non-adiabatic instabilities
at large scales. This doom factor can therefore provide the range of parameters that will give
a priori stable universe, as is often done in literature [20–24, 26, 27, 33, 37].
2.3 Evolution of energy densities and phase portraits
Since the coupling function, Q, is phenomenologically motivated, many different interaction
functions exist, which could either be simple linear or complex non-linear interactions [11, 12].
This often leads to difficulties when trying to solve the coupled conservation equations (1.1)
to obtain analytical expressions for how ρdmandρdeevolve. It is, therefore, informative to
consider how the derivatives of the density parameters ˙Ωxevolve for any arbitrary coupling
Q. This can be used to obtain phase portraits with flow lines in the ( Ωdm,Ωde)-plane that
has attractor and repulsor points. These attractor and repulsor points can tell us how the
ratio of DM to DE evolves and indicate whether the coupling solves the coincidence problem.
Furthermore, these phase portraits can also tell us if the DM or DE energy densities become
negative at any point, which indicates that the interaction Qis unphysical.
For this analysis, we will consider models which contain radiation Ωr, baryonic matter Ωbm,
dark matter Ωdmand dark energy Ωde. This may be done by first considering how the density
parameters evolve with time, which is done by taking the derivative of Ωx=8πG
3H2ρx, (where
x can be either r, bm, dm or de), giving:

From the conservation equations for interacting dark energy models (1.1), we have:
˙ρx=−3Hρx(1 +ωx)±Q, (2.11)
where ±= +forx=dm and ±=−forx=de. Substituting (2.11) into (2.10) gives:

This relation holds for either dark matter or dark energy with any coupling function Q. If
Q= 0, this reduces back to the same expression for the uncoupled case and may be used
not only for dark matter and dark energy but for radiation ( ωr= 1/3) and baryonic matter
(ωbm= 0) as well. For the different components, one therefore has:
˙Ωde= Ω deH[2Ωr+ Ω bm+ Ω dm+ Ω de(1 + 3 ωde)−1−3ωde]−8πG

˙Ωr= Ω rH[2Ωr+ Ω bm+ Ω dm+ Ω de(1 + 3 ωde)−2].(2.16)
Equation (2.15) reduces back to the ΛCDM case if Q= 0andωde=−1, which can be found
in [7]. For our purposes, we are interested in the parameter space of how dark matter and
dark energy evolve with regard to each other. This can be obtained by dividing corresponding
dark matter ˙Ωdmand dark energy ˙Ωdeevolution equations (2.16) by each other, such that:
dΩde
dΩdm=ΩdeH[2Ωr+ Ω bm+ Ω dm+ Ω de(1 + 3 ωde)−1−3ωde]−8πG
3H2Q
ΩdmH[2Ωr+ Ω bm+ Ω dm+ Ω de(1 + 3 ωde)−1] +8πG
3H2Q.(2.17)
This can be used to obtain a set of trajectories or flow lines in the ( Ωdm,Ωde)-plane, which
in turn have stable attractor and unstable repulsor points. These will be used to see if the
ratio of dark matter to dark energy becomes fixed in the past or present, thus addressing
the model’s potential to solve the coincidence problem. Before considering any IDE models,
we will first show how these phase portraits work for the ΛCDM model, as this will be the
standard model to which we will compare our later results.
3 Two interacting dark energy case studies
Now that the general properties of IDE models have been discussed, we will move on to two
case studies. This will show that the properties from table 1 hold in general for IDE models
of any function Qwhile highlighting significant differences between the couplings. First, we
will consider two of the most common IDE models in the literature, where there is a linear
– 8 –coupling function Qproportional to either the dark matter or dark energy density. These
couplings have a strong field theoretical ground [39] and have the form:
Q=δHρ de ; Q=δHρ dm, (3.1)
where His the Hubble parameter (this dependence on Hmay naturally arise from first
principles) and δis a dimensionless coupling constant that determines the strength of the
interaction between dark matter and dark energy [12, 33, 34]. It should be noted that the
coupling constant δis often indicated by α[31, 32] (which has an opposite sign to δ) orξin
the literature [11, 19, 20, 27, 35–37]. For these models, we assume that δ <−3ω(so that the
coupling strength |δ|is not too strong [32]). This condition implies (δ <−3ω)→(δ+3ω <0).
Furthermore, since we require that H > 0;ρdm>0;ρde>0the sign of δwill determine the
direction of energy flow. Therefore, δ >0→Q > 0corresponds to the iDEDM regime and
δ <0→Q < 0to the iDMDE regime. The greatest qualitative difference between the two
couplingfunctionsisthat Q1∝ρdmandQ2∝ρde, whichimpliesthattheeffectofthecoupling
will be either most prominent during early dark matter domination, or later dark energy
domination respectively. Similarly to what was done in [33], we will use the cosmological
parameters of the ΛCDM model from [1] for all subsequent figures and calculations, with
δ= 0.25for the iDEDM and δ=−0.25for iDMDE regimes respectively, while temporarily
choosing ωde=ω=−1, so that the coupling constant δis the only variable that differs
from the ΛCDM model, thus easing comparisons between the ΛCDM and IDE models. These
chosen parameters are purely illustrative. For the latest cosmological parameters obtained
from observations for these IDE models, see [26, 28]. A preliminary analysis done by us,
obtaining cosmological parameters for these IDE models from only supernovae data, can be
found in [42, 43].
3.1 Interaction model: Q=δHρ de
The model Q=δHρ deis one of the most common interaction functions in the literature
and is more popular than the model Q=δHρ dm, which we briefly discuss in section 3.2. A
possible explanation for this is that in the iDMDE regime for Q=δHρ dmmodel, ρde<0in
the past, as was pointed out in [33]. These authors then advocated for a coupling Q∝ρde,
since all energy densities remain positive throughout the past universe history, even in the
iDMDE ( δ <0) regime [33]. This result has often been taken at face value in the literature.
However, we would like to focus attention on the fact that in the iDMDE ( δ <0) regime, these
models will alwayssuffer from negative dark matter energy densities ( ρdm<0) during future
expansion. This can be seen immediately from the interaction function’s proportionality to
thedarkenergydensity, Q∝ρde. ThishasanimmediateeffectontheiDMDEregime. During
future expansion, the dark matter density will decrease, and energy will be transferred away
from DM to DE until the DM density eventually reaches zero density. However, as there
is no mechanism to stop this energy transfer (since energy transfer is only proportional to
dark energy density), the energy transfer will still continue, inevitably leading to negative
dark matter densities ( ρdm<0) in the future . This observation should render these models
less favourable and should have been noted by many recent papers that have neglected to
mention this problem [20, 26–28, 35–37]. The exact conditions to ensure positive energy
densities throughout the past and future expansion is calculated in section 3.1.3. However,
this result can immediately be seen from the phase portraits of these models.
– 9 –3.1.1 Phase portraits
Assuming the coupling Q=δHρ de=δH
3H2
8πGΩde
, equation (2.16) becomes:
dΩde
dΩdm=Ωde[2Ωr+ Ω bm+ Ω dm+ Ω de(1 + 3 ωde)−1−3ωde−δ]
Ωdm[2Ωr+ Ω bm+ Ω dm+ Ω de(1 + 3 ωde)−1] +δΩde, (3.2)
where we have used the fact that8πG
3H2ρde= Ω de. Since this coupling is not proportional to
the dark matter density, it may be seen from (2.16) that the evolution of baryonic matter
and dark matter may be grouped together. It should be noted that baryonic matter is still
separately conserved hereand experiences no new interaction. Thus, if dark matteris grouped
with baryonic matter and radiation is negligible ( Ωr= 0), (3.2) becomes:
dΩde
dΩm=Ωde[Ωm+ Ω de(1 + 3 ωde)−1−3ωde−δ]
Ωm[Ωm+ Ω de(1 + 3 ωde)−1] +δΩde. (3.3)
Using (3.3), the evolution of matter and dark energy may now be expressed with a phase
portrait in the ( Ωm,Ωde)-plane, as seen in figure 1.
Figure 1 . Phase portraits for ΩdmandΩde(Q=δHρ de)
In figure 1, every point on the plane defines a unique trajectory (as indicated by the blue
arrows). However, for convenience, we have specified different trajectories (red lines) which
pass through specific values for the present matter Ω(m,0)= 0.3and dark energy densities
Ω(de,0)= 0.1,0.2, ...,1.1, as was done in [7] for the ΛCDM model. In figure 1, the left panel
shows the phase portrait of a positive δ(iDEDM), while the right panel shows a negative δ
(iDMDE). The equilibrium points are calculated by setting ˙Ωm= 0and ˙Ωde= 0in equation
(3.3) and solving for ΩmandΩde, yielding:

– 10 –which is known as an attractor [7]. It can be seen that the repulsor point is the same in both
cases but that the attractor point is instead shifted by the dark coupling. This highlights the
point that the effect of the coupling is more dominant during later dark energy dominance
forQ∝ρde. These equilibrium points also highlight the coincidence problem, as the ratio
of their coordinates indicates which value rtends to in the past r−or the future r+. The
ΛCDM model has r−→ ∞in the past, whilst approaching r+→0in the future. IDE models
that can find a constant non-zero or non-infinite value for either r−orr+should solve the
coincidence problem in either the past or the future, respectively. For this model, we have:
r−=Ω(m,−)

Therefore, this model will not solve the coincidence problem in the past as r−but will stabilise

positive δ >0(iDEDM) solves the coincidence problem, but δ <0(iDMDE) causes negative
energy densities. This brings us to the often-overlooked problem of the iDMDE regime for
this model. It is clear from (3.4) that Ωdm,+≈Ωm,+=−δ
3ω, alongside ( ω <0), must imply
that δ <(iDMDE) leads to a negative energy attractor solution for Ωdm. We should also
note that baryonic matter is grouped with dark matter. However, in the distant future, it
dilutes as in the ΛCDM model, and its contribution should become negligible, validating the
approximation Ωdm,+≈Ωm,+.
3.1.2 Background analytical equations
To obtain analytical solutions for how the dark matter ρdmand dark energy ρdedensities
evolve, we need to solve the conservation equations (1.1) with Q=δHρ de, which yields
expressions for ρdmandρde:

Here (3.6) and (3.7) matching the energy densities found in [12, 33, 35, 37]. The effective
equation of states for this model can be obtained by substituting the coupling equation
Q=δHρ deinto (2.4). The dark matter effective equation of state is then:

which matches with [12, 28, 33, 36, 37]. It can be seen that ωeff

dence on r, while, in contrast ωeff

3.1.3 Positive energy density conditions
Positive energy conditions for these models were obtained in [38] from a dynamical systems
analysis, where it was claimed that no viable scenarios exist. However, we want to show that
viable conditions exist using a similar approach to what was done in [32]. For this model,
it can be seen that ρde(3.7) is always positive (since a−(δ+3ω+3)>0for all values of δ),
while ρdm(3.6) has multiple terms which could become negative. We now derive the exact
conditions to ensure that the ρdmis always positive. To do this, we need to find out where the
dark matter energy density crosses the zero energy density boundary and becomes negative
so that conditions may be chosen to avoid this zero crossing. This is found when we set the
dark matter energy density (3.6) equal to zero and solve for a:
a−(δ+3ω)= 1 + r0δ+ 3ω
δ
. (3.14)
Using (3.14), we can find solutions where the dark matter energy density crosses zero and
becomes negative (ρdm<0). From (3.14) and the relation a= (1 + z)−1, this zero crossing
(ρdm= 0)happens at exactly the redshift z(dm=0):
z(dm=0) =
1 +r0δ+ 3ω
δ 1
δ+3ω
−1. (3.15)
Using (3.14), we may explore four scenarios, (A-(D), where the energy density may possibly
cross zero and become negative. These scenarios will be either the iDMDE ( δ <0) or iDEDM
(δ >0) scenarios for either the pastor thefuture. This leads to:
a−(δ+3ω)= 1 + r0δ+ 3ω
δ
where (δ+ 3ω <0) (3.16)
δ <0⇒(
Past (a <1)→ (0<L.H.S. <1 ;R.H.S. >1) (A)
Future (a >1)→ (L.H.S. >1 ;R.H.S. >1) (B)
δ >0⇒(
Past (a <1)→ (0<L.H.S. <1 ;R.H.S. <1) (C)
Future (a >1)→ (L.H.S. >1 ;R.H.S. <1) (D)
Here we can immediately see that for both (A)and(D)the L.H.S. and R.H.S. will never
cross, which means that there will be no solution for (3.16) and thus the ρdmwill never cross
– 12 –zero and become negative. Therefore, ρdmwill always remain positive for scenerio’s (A)
(Pastexpansion with δ <0) and (D)(futureexpansion with δ >0). Furthermore, scenario
(B)will always have a solution, and therefore, the dark energy density will always become
negative in the future, as shown by the attractor point in figure 1.

Thus, if condition (3.17) is met, then scenario (C)(Pastexpansion with δ >0) will always
have positive energy densities. Therefore, since both (C)and(D)will always have positive
energy densities, the positive coupling δ > 0(with condition (3.17) met) may be seen as
physical. Since the condition (3.17) holds, it implies that the condition δ <−3ωmust neces-
sarily hold as well. Taking the conditions (δ >0) ; (δ <−3ω)and

Table 2. Conditions for positive energy densities throughout cosmic evolution (Q=δHρ de)
In table 2, (+)means that the energy densities will always remain positive, (−)means that
the energy densities will always become negative somewhere in the cosmic evolution. Any
scenario leading to negative energy densities should be considered unphysical . Thus, only
systems that abide by the condition (3.18) may be considered physical. From this condition
(3.18), it may be concluded that only IDE models where energy flows from dark energy to
dark matter iDEDM ( δ >0) should be seriously considered as couplings where energy flows
from dark matter todark energyiDMDE ( δ <0) willalways lead to eithernegative energiesin
the past or the future at redshift z(dm=0)(3.15). This only holds for the coupling Q=δHρ de,
and may not be the case for other coupling models.
3.1.4 Cosmic coincidence problem
For this model, the coincidence problem is not solved in the past but instead in the future.
This can be seen from the repulsor point r−=∞(3.5) being the same as in the ΛCDM
model. Conversely, the attractor point r+in (3.5) shows that this model should solve the
coincidence problem in the future, at least for the iDEDM regime. We will now reproduce
these results from the analytical expression for ρdm(3.6) and ρde(3.7), which we may use to
obtain the following simplified expression for rin terms of redshift z:
r(z) =ρdm(z)
ρde(z)=
r0+δ
δ+ 3ω
(1 +z)−(δ+3ω)−δ
δ+ 3ω(3.19)
– 13 –From (3.19), it can be seen that rhas the proportionality, such that:
r∝a(δ+3ω)→ ζQ1=ζQ=−3ω−δ. (3.20)
For the ΛCDM model ζΛCDM = 3, and for a general uncoupled model ζ=−3ω, thus from
(3.20) it can be seen that:
ζQ=−3ω−δ→(
ifδ >0(iDEDM) → ζQ< ζalleviates coincidence problem
ifδ <0(iDMDE) → ζQ> ζworsens coincidence problem .(3.21)
This behaviour coincides with the original analysis in (2.8). Furthermore, this effect becomes
more extreme in both the distant past (at large redshifts (1+z)→ ∞) and the distant future
(at redshifts (1+z)→0). This can be seen by considering these limits for (3.44), while noting
the condition δ+ 3ω <0, thus:
lim
(1+z)→∞r−→ ∞ , ; lim
(1+z)→0r+=→ −δ
δ+ 3ω. (3.22)
These results match what was found from the phase portrait in figure 1, with the repulsor
point r−and attractor point r+(3.5) being the same as the (1 +z)→ ∞and(1 +z)→0
redshift limits found for rin (3.22), respectively. Furthermore, in the distant future, rhas
the proportionality:
lim
(1+z)→0r+∝a0→ ζ(Q,−)= 0.(3.23)
Since ris constant and ζ(Q,+)= 0, this model solves the coincidence problem for future
expansion. This only holds for the δ >0(iDEDM) regime, since δ <0(iDMDE) will lead
to a negative constant r+due to ρdmwhich becomes negative at z(dm=0)(3.15), as shown in
table 2, which is unphysical. Thus, for (1 +z)→0in the future, we have:
lim
(1+z)→0ζQ= 0(
ifδ >0→r−= +constant solvescoincidence problem
ifδ <0→r−=−constant negative energy densities (unphysical) .
(3.24)
To understand this behaviour, we can consider how the effective equations of state ωefffor
this model evolve. To do this, we first need the explicit relation for ωeff
dm, which is obtained
by substituting in rfrom (3.19) into (3.8):
ωeff
dm=−δ

r=−δ

r0+δ

δ+3ω.(3.25)
In the distant past the ratio r−→ ∞, while in the distant future r+→ −δ
δ+3ω, as was
independently shown in both (3.5) and (3.22). Noting that ωeff
de=ω+δ
3from (3.9), we can
see how the dynamical effective equation of state ωeff

future:

– 14 –Theeffectiveequationsofstatefordarkmatteranddarkenergyare, therefore, thesameinthe
distant future ( ωeff
dm=ωeff
de). This shows that dark matter and dark energy redshift and dilute
at the same rate in the future, effectively solving the coincidence problem by keeping the ratio
of dark matter to dark energy constant. This shows that whenever r= +constant →ζ= 0,
we also have ωeff
dm=ωeff
de.
Furthermore, we can also see that in the distant past, ωeff
dm=ωdm. The effect of the coupling
on dark matter will thus become negligible for past expansion, effectively mimicking the
behaviour of uncoupled dark matter. These predictions agree with what was found by [8, 11]
and is confirmed by plotting r(3.19) alongside both ωeff
dm(3.25) and ωeff
de(3.9) in figure 2.
Figure 2 . Coincidence problem and effective equations of state ( Q=δHρ de)
From the left panel in figure 2, it can be seen that for the coupled model with δ >0(iDEDM),
rdiffers with many orders of magnitude in the past but converges to a constant value in the
future r→r+(indicated by the dashed green line), as predicted by (3.5) and (3.22), making
the present value less coincidental. The coincidence problem is thus solved for the future
expansion history. This coincides with the right panel where ωeff
dm=ωeff
de, as shown in (3.26).
The coincidence problem is also alleviated for the past expansion since the slope of ris
smaller (as predicted by (3.21)), which coincides with ωeff
de> ω defrom (1.1), causing a smaller
difference in ( ωeff
dm−ωeff
de).
Conversely, for δ <0(iDEDM), we have ωeff
de< ω de, which worsens the coincidence problem
for the past expansion history (since the slope is greater than the case δ= 0). For future
expansion, it can also be seen that rbecomes zero, while ωeff
dediverges at the same point. This
is due to the dark matter density ρdmwhich becomes zero in the future at redshift z(dm=0)
(red dotted line) from (3.15), and then stays negative for the rest of the future expansion,
indicating the unviability of the iDMDE regime. Thus, the results from (3.22), (3.21), (3.24)
and (3.26) can clearly be seen in figure 2 and may be summarised as:
δ >0 (iDEDM )(

– 15 –3.1.5 Evolution of energy densities and cosmic equalities
For this model, we saw that the coincidence problem is solved for the future (3.27). This can
be clearly seen by plotting ρdm(3.6) and ρde(3.7) against redshift zin figure 3.
Figure 3 . Energy densities ρvs redshift - ( Q=δHρ de)
In figure 3, we see that for δ >0(iDEDM), dark matter receives energy from dark energy,
causing ρdmto redshift slower ωeff
dm< ω dm(smaller slope), while ρderedshifts faster (greater
slope). This behaviour alleviates the coincidence problem in the past. In the future the slope
at which ρdmandρderedshift becomes the same, coinciding with ωeff
dm=ωeff
de(3.26) and the
coincidence problem being solved, while ρdmdilutes similar to the ΛCDM model in the past
where ωeff
dm=ωdm(3.26). All these observations coincide with (3.27).
It may also be noted that if δ >0(iDEDM), ρdedecreases over time; while if δ <0(iDMDE),
ρdeincreasesovertime. Thedarkenergy, therefore, effectivelybehaveslikeeitherquintessence
or phantom dark energy, respectively, with an equation of state ωeff
de=ω+δ
3. Since this effect
continues indefinitely, it may cause a big rip singularity in the future at the time (3.38).
Wecannowshowthatotherimplicationsofadarkcouplingfromtable1holdforthiscoupling
function. This is done by plotting the density parameters of dark matter Ωdm(3.10), dark
energy Ωde(3.11), radiation Ωr(3.13) and baryonic matter Ωbm(3.12) in figure 4, as was done
in figure 2 of [33] for only the past expansion , but we include the crucial future expansion as
well. For δ >0(iDEDM), there will also be a time in the future when ρdm= 0at redshift
z(dm=0)(3.15), after which ρdm<0for the rest of expansion, which is unphysical. The
predicted value for z(dm=0)is indicated by the red marker in figure 4.
From figures 3 and 4, it is seen that for δ >0(iDEDM), there is lessdark matter and more
dark energy in the past, and vice versa for δ <0(iDMDE). For δ >0the matter-radiation
equality happens laterand the matter-dark energy equality earlierin cosmic history, with
the opposite holding for δ <0[33]. Analytical expressions giving the exact redshift where
the radiation-matter z(r=dm+bm) (3.28) equality occurs may be calculated for this model by
setting Ω(bm,0)+ Ω (dm,0)= Ω (r,0)from equations (3.10), (3.12) and (3.13) and solving for z
– 16 –Figure 4 . Density parameters vs redshift - ( Q=δHρ de)

These results are indicated by the markers in figure 4, matching with where the corresponding

In figure 3 it may also be seen there is complete matter domination (Ωdm,Ωde)−= (1,0),
as in the ΛCDM case. Conversely, dark energy never completely dominates in the future,

– 17 –3.1.6 Evolution of deceleration parameter
For this model, we have seen that the density parameters mostly deviate from the ΛCDM
model during dark energy domination. We, therefore, expect this coupling function to change
the behaviour of the deceleration parameter qand the effective equation of state for the fluid
ωeffmost dramatically in the future expansion. The expressions for both q(equation 2.2)
andωeff(equation 2.3) are the same for all IDE models, with only the density parameters
Ωxdiffering. Thus, for this model, we substitute in the density parameters for dark matter
Ωdm(3.10), dark energy Ωde(3.11), radiation Ωr(3.13) and baryonic matter Ωbm(3.11) into
equations (2.2) and (2.3), yielding figures 5 and 6.

state ωeffwith redshift ( Q=δHρ de)

qwith redshift ( 1 +z) (Q=δHρ de)
From figures 5 and 6, we can see that the past behaviour for the coupled models is almost
identical to that of the ΛCDM model, with initial deceleration followed by acceleration from
the cosmic jerk onwards. This cosmic jerk occurs at the transition redshift zt, for which an
analytical expression (3.31) can be derived by setting q= 0in equation (2.2), giving:

The transition redshift for all three values of δis calculated from (3.31) and indicated by the
marker in figure 5 and 6, while the exact redshift for each can be found in tables 4 and 5.
Based on these results, we can confirm the conclusions from table 1, which state that:
Cosmic jerk ( zt)(
δ >0(iDEDM): zIDE> zΛCDMhappens earlierthan ΛCDM ,
δ <0(iDMDE): zIDE< zΛCDMhappens laterthan ΛCDM .
(3.32)
From figures 5 and 6 it can also be seen that similar to the ΛCDM model, these models
experience complete radiation-domination ( Ωr,Ωdm+bm ,Ωde)≈(1,0,0)→q= 1;ωeff= 1/3,
followed by complete matter-domination ( Ωr,Ωdm+bm ,Ωde)≈(0,1,0)→q= 1/2;ωeff=
0. As seen in figure 4, these models do not show complete dark energy domination, but
instead, the density parameters are obtained from the attractor point (3.4), such that we

3.1.7 Hubble parameter and age of the universe
The interaction Qwill affect the age of the universe, which can be seen from the evolution of
the Friedmann equation from (2.1) with the energy densities ρr=ρ(r,0)a−4,ρbm=ρ(bm,0)a−3,
ρdmfrom (3.6), ρdefrom (3.7) and k= 0. Since both the deceleration parameter and the
total effective equation of state deviate mostly during dark energy domination, we expect
the expansion rate to change mostly for future expansion. This may be seen by plotting the
Hubble parameter (2.1), relative to the non-interacting case ( H/H δ=0), against redshift. The
evolution of the scale factor against time is also plotted, and the universe’s age is calculated
by numerically integrating (2.1). This yields figures 7 and 8.
Figure 7 . Relative Hubble parameter ( H/H δ=0)
vs redshift ( Q=δHρ de)
Figure 8 . Evolution of scale factor with time
(Q=δHρ de)
In figure 7, H/H δ=0<1forδ > 0(iDEDM) throughout most of the expansion history,
indicating a slower expansion rate. This is again due to the overall suppression of dark
matter seen in figure 4, which causes a lower value for qandωeffand therefore a slower
expansion rate. Due to δ >0(iDEDM) having a slower expansion rate, more time is needed
for the universe to evolve from a singularity ( a= 0) to its current size ( a= 1), causing an
– 19 –older age for the universe as seen in figure 8. The opposite of this holds for δ <0(iDEDM).
We therefore confirm the following result from table 1:
Age of universe ( t0)(
δ >0(iDEDM): t(0,IDE)> t(0,ΛCDM)Olderuniverse than ΛCDM ,
δ <0(iDMDE): t(0,IDE)< t(0,ΛCDM)Younger universe than ΛCDM .

To get a sense of the magnitude of the changes in these important events, we may quantita-
tively describe the events in figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 with the cosmological parameters of
theΛCDM model from [1], with the additional parameter δ= 0(ΛCDM), δ= 0.25(iDEDM)
andδ=−0.25(iDMDE), in tables 3, 4 and 5 respectively.

3.1.8 Doom factor and big rip
As previously discussed, an equation of state ω=−1causes gravitational instabilities [27, 37].
The stability of this model will once again be dependent on the doom factor d(2.9). This
condition d<0guarantees an a priori stable universe as discussed in section 2.2. Thus, for
Q=δHρ dewe have the doom factor (2.9) [33]:
d=Q
3Hρde(1 +ω)=δHρ de
3Hρde(1 +ω)=δ
3(1 + ω), (3.35)
– 20 –where we require d<0to ensure the stability of the universe. We can see from (3.48), that
this only occurs if δand(1 +ω)have opposite signs [20, 27, 33, 35–37]:
d<0(
δ <0 ; ω >−1(Quintessence regime)
δ >0 ; ω <−1(Phantom regime)→No instabilities expected
(3.36)
d>0(
δ >0 ; ω >−1(Quintessence regime)
δ <0 ; ω <−1(Phantom regime)→Instabilities can develop if d>1.
Besides being stable, these models must have positive energy densities throughout the entire
past and future expansion to be viable. We, therefore, need to consider the positive energy
condition 0< δ < −3ω/(1 +1
r0)in (3.18) and table 2. Here it was shown that we will always
have ρdm<0in the future if δ <0(iDMDE), which is unphysical. The results from (3.36)
and (3.18) are summarized together in table 6 to determine the viability of the model.

Table 6. Stability and positive energy criteria ( Q=δHρ de)
Fromtable6, weseethattheonlyscenariothatisfreefrombothnegativeenergydensitiesand
instabilities is phantom dark energy ω <−1in the δ >0(iDEDM) regime. These models
will thus violate many of the energy conditions of general relativity; and suffer from the
consequences of doing so [40]. Since (3.26) and (3.33) shows that ωeff
+=ωeff
dm=ωeff
de=ω+δ
3
in the future, the value of δwill determine if the universe model will experience a late time
big rip singularity as noted by [38]. For a big rip to occur, we need ρde→ ∞in a finite time.
This will only occur for this model if ρde(3.7) increases with scale factor as the universe
expands, which only happens if the effective equation of state ωeff
de=ω+δ

If condition (3.37) is obeyed, the equivalent equation for the time of the rip tripin uncoupled
phantom dark energy models [7, 41] can be derived for this IDE model (see Appendix A) as:
trip≈ −2
3H0(1 +ω+δ
3)r
1−δ
δ+3ω 
1−Ω(dm+bm ,0),(3.38)
which reduces back to the uncoupled case if δ= 0, found in [7, 41]. The predicted time of
the big rip (3.38) is plotted alongside the evolution of the scale factor (using the Friedmann
equation (2.1) with a phantom dark energy equation of state ω=−1.15for illustrative pur-
poses), in figure 9.
– 21 –Figure 9 . Evolution of energy density, scale factor and the big rip for phantom ( ω=−1.15) IDE
models - ( Q=δHρ de)
In figure 9, we can see that the predicted time of the big rip singularity trip(3.38) coincides
with the time at which both a→ ∞andρde→ ∞. The time tripis significantly affected by
the coupling, such that:
Big rip(
δ >0(iDEDM): t(rip,IDE)> t(rip,δ=0)Laterbig rip than δ= 0,
δ <0(iDMDE): t(rip,IDE)< t(rip,δ=0)Earlierbig rip than δ= 0.(3.39)
These models can still be viable ( ω <−1in the δ >0(iDEDM) regime) and avoid a big
rip, as long as condition (3.37) is not met, such that ωeff
de=ω+δ
3>−1, while quintessence
models with ω >−1may also have a big rip if ωeff
de<−1. Thus, if we want to avoid a
big rip at trip(3.38), we require the condition ωeff
de=ω+δ
3>−1(3.37), which may be
rewritten as δ >−3(ω+ 1). This result may be combined with the positive energy condition
0< δ < −3ω/(1 +1
r0)(3.18) to get the following condition:
3(ω+ 1)< δ < −3ω
1 +1
r0with ωde<−1.(3.40)
Condition (3.40) describes the iDEDM regime with phantom dark energy. It ensures that all
energies are positive throughout the future and past universe evolution and that early-time
gravitational instabilities and late-time future big rip singularities are avoided.
3.2 A brief summary of results for interaction model Q=δHρ dm
We will now consider an interaction model where the interaction is proportional to the dark
matter density Q∝ρdm. This model is less popular in the literature than the previous model
where Q=δHρ de, which may be due to the iDMDE regime in this model having negative
dark energy densities ρde<0in the past, as was pointed out in [33]). The two models
may be analysed in the same manner due to the similarity of the two interaction functions.
For the sake of brevity and to avoid needless repetition, we will only briefly summarise the
equivalent main results of this model. A full analysis of this model with all equivalent figures
– 22 –and calculations shown may be found in the dissertation on which this paper is based [42].
To obtain analytical solutions for how the dark matter ρdmand dark energy ρdedensities
evolve, we need to solve the conservation equations (1.1) with Q=δHρ dm, which yields
expressions for ρdmandρde:
ρdm=ρ(dm,0)a(δ−3), (3.41)
ρde=

a−3(1+ω). (3.42)
The effective equation of state for dark matter ωeff

be obtained by substituting the coupling equation Q=δHρ dminto (2.4), yielding:
ωeff
dm=−δ
3, ωeff
de=ωde+δ
3r. (3.43)
The solutions (3.41), (3.42) (3.43) match with the results found in [12, 32, 33]. It can be
seen be seen that ωeff
dmis constant throughout cosmic evolution, while ωeff
deis dynamic with a
dependence on the coincidence problem ratio r=ρdm/ρde, which may be given in terms of
redshift zby the following equation:
r(z) =1

(1 +z)(δ+3ω)−δ

which matches [11]. Equations (3.41), (3.42), (3.43), and (3.44) can be seen to reduce back
to the ΛCDM model when δ= 0andω=−1. Similarly to what was done in section 3.1.3,
we may obtain the following general condition to ensure that the energy densities will always
remain positive for the coupling model Q=δHρ dm. This condition is:
0< δ < −3ω
(1 +r0). (3.45)
Similar to table 2, the energy densities for all these conditions may be encapsulated in table
7 below.
Conditions ρdm(Past) ρdm(Future) ρde(Past) ρde(Future) Physical

Table 7. Conditions for positive energy densities throughout cosmic evolution (Q1=δHρ dm)
From table 7, it may be seen in that in the iDMDE regime ( δ <0), the dark energy density
always becomes negative (ρde<0)in the past, as was pointed out in [33]. This zero energy
crossing (ρde= 0)happens at exactly redshift z(de=0):
z(de=0) =

This zero energy redshift z(de=0)(3.46) and the exact positive energy condition 3.45 may be
considered new results. Therefore, from table 7 for the coupling Q=δHρ dm, the iDMDE
– 23 –regime ( δ <0) should be considered unphysical, while the iDEDM ( δ <0) regime may be
physical if condition (3.45) is met.
Forthismodel,alltheresultsfromtable1hold,butthereisanimportantdifferenceconcerning
how this model addresses the coincidence problem. Where Q=δHρ decan alleviate or even
solve the coincidence problem in the future (3.27), this model instead effectively addresses
this during past expansion, when the interaction between the dark sector is most prominent.
Similarly to (3.27), this result may be summarised as:
δ >0 (iDEDM )(
Past expansion: ωeff
dm=ωeff
de(ζQ= 0)solvescoincidence problem
Future expansion: ωeff
dm< ω dm(ζQ< ζ)alleviates coincidence problem ,
(3.47)
δ <0 (iDMDE )(
Past expansion: ωeff
dm=ωeff
de(ρde<0)negative energy densities
Future expansion: ωeff
dm> ω dm(ζQ> ζ)worsens coincidence problem .
Furthermore, as done in section 3.1.8, we need this model to be free from gravitational
instabilities. Thus, for Q=δHρ dmwe have the doom factor (2.9):
d=Q
3Hρde(1 +ω)=δHρ dm
3Hρde(1 +ω)=δ
3(1 + ω)ρdm
ρde, (3.48)
where we also apply the conditions that ρdm>0;ρde>0. Since we need d<0to ensure
a stable universe, we can see from (3.48) that this will only occur if δand(1 + ω)have
opposite signs [33]. These results should be combined with the positive energy condition
0< δ < −3ω
(1+r0)from (3.45) and table 7. This implies that ρde<0ifδ <0(iDMDE), which
is unphysical and should be ruled out. The results from (3.48) and (3.45) are taken together
in table 8.

-DM→DE <−1Phantom + X√X X

Table 8. Stability and positive energy criteria ( Q1=δHρ dm)
From table 8, we see that the only scenario that is free from both negative energy densities
and instabilities is phantom dark energy ω <−1in the δ >0(iDEDM) regime. This has the
consequence that these models will also be plagued by the problems associated with phantom
dark energy. Since ωeff
de=ωde(3.47) in the future, an immediate consequence of dark energy
beingin the phantom regime, is that the universe model will always experience a late time big
rip singularity as noted by [38]. An equivalent equation to (3.38) for the time of the big rip
trip[7, 41] is derived for this IDE model, similar to that done in Appendix A, giving:
trip≈ −2

which reduces back to the uncoupled case if δ= 0, found in [7, 41].
– 24 –4 Conclusions
In this paper, we clarified the cosmological consequences of IDE models for any generic in-
teraction Qas summarised in table 1. We also derived equation (2.17) which may be used
to obtain phase portraits for the evolution of dark matter and dark energy densities for any
generic interaction Qwithout the need to solve the conservation equation (1.1). We then
considered two case studies of linear dark energy couplings, Q=δHρ deandQ=δHρ dm. For
these models, we derived the often neglected positive energy conditions 0< δ < −3ω/(1+1
r0)
(3.18) and 0< δ < −3ω/(1 +r0)(3.45) respectively, from which we note the important fact
that the δ <0(iDMDE) regime will always lead to ρdm<0in the future for Q=δHρ deand
ρde<0in the past for Q=δHρ dm. This implies that the δ <0(iDMDE) regime should not
be taken seriously as a potential dark energy candidate for these models. For the more viable
δ >0(iDEDM) regime, we saw that the model Q=δHρ decould solve the coincidence prob-
lem in the future whilst alleviating the problem for the past (3.27). Conversely, the model
Q=δHρ dmcan solve the coincidence problem in the past and alleviate the problem for the
future (3.47). Furthermore, the iDEDM regime for both models predicts a laterradiation-
matter equality, while both the matter-dark energy equality (3.30) and cosmic jerk will occur
earlier(3.32). The age of these universe models will also be older(3.34). The opposite holds
forδ <0(iDMDE). From tables 6 and 8, we see that the only viable regime for both these
models, which avoid both negative energy densities and gravitational instabilities, is phantom
dark energy ω <−1in the δ >0(iDEDM) regime. This has the consequence that model
Q=δHρ dmwill always end with a future big rip singularity at the derived time trip(3.49),
while Q=δHρ demay avoid this fate with the right choice of cosmological parameters. The
model Q=δHρ dewill only experience a big rip future singularity at the derived time trip
(3.38) if the condition ωeff
de=ω+δ
3<−1(3.37) is met. This big rip may be avoided if the
conditions 3(ω+ 1)< δ < −3ω

, alongside ωde<−1(3.40) is also obeyed.
In conclusion, we are not advocating these IDE models as superior alternatives to the ΛCDM
model. However, we instead want to emphasise the importance of choosing the correct pa-
rameter space (iDEDM regime, with phantom dark energy) to avoid both negative energies
and instabilities (as summarised in tables 6 and 8). We hope other researchers will use these
theoreticalconstraintsontheparameterspacewhenfurtherinvestigatingtheviabilityofthese
IDE models to address the current problems in cosmology with the latest observational data.

– 25 –A Derivation for the time of big rip in IDE model Q=δHρ de
For this model, it is important to note that in the distant future dark energy never completely
dominates the other fluids (as usually indicated by Ωde→1in the distant future). This is
because this model solves the coincidence problem for future expansion, thereby fixing the
ratio of dark matter to dark energy. Radiation and baryons may become negligible in the
distant future, but some terms from the dark matter energy density should still be included.
The Friedmann equation (2.1) for this coupled model with only dark matter (3.6) and dark
energy (3.7) is:
˙a

In the future, as the scale factor agrows large, the contribution from the first two terms
in (A.1) becomes small relative to the other terms and may be neglected. Doing this, the
Friedmann equation (A.1) becomes:
˙a
a
≈H0s

The current dark energy density parameter may also be written as Ω(de,0)= 1−Ω(dm,0)−
Ω(bm,0)−Ω(r,0)≈1−Ω(dm+bm ,0). The Friedmann equation (A.2) then becomes:

For the integral on the right-hand side to become zero, we need 3/2(1 + ω+δ/3)<0.
Phantom dark energy does not necessarily imply this. For this to hold, we need the effective
state equation for dark energy to be smaller than −1. Ifωeff
de=ω+δ/3<−1then it follows
that3/2(1 + ω+δ/3)<0which will cause the integral a3(1+ω+δ/3)
