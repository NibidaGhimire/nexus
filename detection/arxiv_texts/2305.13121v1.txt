Abstract  
The archetype of leadership serves as a crucial link between leade rs and their followers, yet many 
studies on leadership within the construction industry have neglected to examine this vital 
connection.  This study aimed to investigate how transformational leadership affects team 
processes, mediated by change in team members.  The study had four objectives: to evaluate the 
relationship between transformational leadership and team processes, to assess the relationship 
between transformational leadership and change in team members, to examine the relationship 
between change team members and team processes, and to establish the mediating role of change 
in team members. A self -administered questionnaire was distributed to construction project team 
members in Abuja and Kaduna, and statistical analysis using path modeling in Smart PLS  3 
software revealed a significant positive relationship between transformational leadership and team 
processes, transformational leadership and change in team members, changes in team members 
and team processes, and changes in team members mediating the r elationship between 
transformational leadership and team processes. Future studies should consider cultural 
differences.  
Key words: T ransformational leadership ; team processes ; change in team members;  project 
managers.  
1.0 Introduction  
Over the past decade, leadership research has focused on assessing the direct impact of leadership 
on organisation al outcomes such as performance  (Anantatmula, 2010; Larsson et al., 2015; Turner 
& Müller, 2005) , organisation al citizenship behavio ur (Gilmore et al., 2013; López -Domínguez et 
al., 2013; Öztürk & Ay, 2015) , job satisfaction  (Gaviria -Rivera & Lopez -Zapata, 2019) , 
organisation al commitment, and individual and team performance  and creativity  (A. Ali et al., 
2020; Baskoro, 2021; Khairuddin et al., 2021; Maqsoom et al., 2022) . During this period, the 
emphasis of leadership research has moved from transactional to tran sformational archetypes of 
leadership  (Akhavan Tabassi & Hassan Abu Bakar, 2010; Anwar, 2016; Oswald et al., n.d.; Y. 
Zhang et al., 2018) . Transformational le adership has been described as a leadership style that 
motivates and inspires followers to achieve their goals and objectives beyond their self -interests  
(Akhavan Tabassi & Hassan Abu Bakar, 2010; Avolio et al., 1991; Avolio & Bass, 2001; Bass, 
1999; Bass & Avolio, 1993, 1994; Den Hartog et al., 1997; Jung & Sosik, 2002) . 
Although there have been empirical research studies that have investigated team processes as an 
outcome variable and mediator variable with transformational leadership  (Aga et al., 2016; 
Akhavan Tabassi et al., 2014; H. Ali et al., 2021; Dionne et al., 2004; Gaviria -Rivera & Lopez -
Zapata, 2019; Lehmann -Willenbrock et al., 2015; Nauman et al., 2022; Tabassi et al., 2017) , the 
association between th ese constructs has not been established with mediating mechanism of how 
transformational leadership influenced change in team members  in terms of their attitude, 
motivation, and perception toward work .  
However, little research has been conducted on the im pact of transformational leadership on team 
processes when mediated by change in team members ' attitude, motivation, and perception toward 
the task.  Team processes are the cognitive, verbal, and behaviour al activities that teams use to 
achieve their object ives. These processes include communication, collaboration, and conflict management. They are crucial for the achievement of team goals, and effective team processes 
contribute to the team's overall success.  There have been few studies focused on the contr ibution 
of leadership behavio ur on team processes and investigated the relationship between 
transformational leadership and team processes. Several studies have suggested that 
transformational leadership is positively associated with team processes. This s uggests that project 
managers who demonstrate transformational leadership behavio urs may positively impact team 
processes.  However, few studies have focused on the mediating mechanisms that explain the 
relationship between transformational leadership and t eam processes. Research has suggested that 
team building and leader -member exchange can mediate the relationship between transformational 
leadership and project success.   
The current study aims to extend the existing transformational leadership team proces ses models 
by assuming that transformational leadership behavio ur from project managers influences change 
in team members ' attitude, motivation, and perception towards the task, thereby mediating the 
relationship between transformational leadership and tea m processes. The study will examine 
whether transformational leadership behavio ur leads to change in team members ' attitude, 
motivation, and perception toward the task, and whether these changes mediate the relationship 
between transformational leadership and team processes.  
2.0 Literature Review  
In this section, we will outline the theoretical basis for the three key components of the study: team 
processes , transformational leadership, and change in change in change in team members . 
2.1 Team Processes  
Most team effectiveness models, including those developed by  (Guzzo & Shea, 1992) , (Gist et al., 
1987) , and (Hackman, 1983; Tannenbaum et al., 1992) , place a centra l focus on team processes. 
One model that has been influential in organisation al studies for several decades is McGrath's 
(1964) input -process -outcome (IPO) model. Inputs represent the antecedent factors that facilitate 
or hinder team member interaction, including individual member characteristics, team -level 
factors, and organisati onal and contextual factors. Outcomes refer to the valued results, such as 
timely completion, efficient resource utilization, and high -quality outputs. Team processes serve 
as the linking mechanism between inputs and outcomes and refer to how change in change in 
change in team members  interact toward the project goal. Team processes can be divided into three 
classifications proposed by (Marks et al., 2001) : tran sition (mission analysis, planning, goal 
specification, and strategy formulation), action (task accomplishment, progress monitoring, 
coordination, and self -monitoring/support), and interpersonal (conflict management, motivation 
and confidence -building, and  affect management). Traditionally, team processes were categorized 
as either "taskwork" or "teamwork," where task work refers to roles individuals must fulfill to 
accomplish the team's task, while teamwork describes the interaction among change in change in 
change in team members . 
2.1.1 Transition Process  
(Marks et al., 2001)  proposed that team processes occur periodically, with transition processes 
setting the  stage for subsequent actions. While there is limited empirical research on transition 
processes, some studies have shed light on their importance. For example, (Chong, 2007; Janicik 
& Bartel, 2003)  found that planning helped establish norms related to time management, which 
were positively assoc iated with performance. Similarly, (Chiu et al., 2016; Hiller et al., 2006; 
Motowidlo & Van Scotter, 1994 ; Riggio et al., 2003; Z. Zhang et al., 2012)  discovered that shared 
leadership behaviour s, such as planning and organizing, significantly predicted supervisor -rated 
team performance.  Teams that engage in transition processes tend to perform better than those that do not. In 
particular, these teams are more likely to focus on coordination issues, which ultimately leads to 
better performance (LePine et al., 2008; Olson et al., 1992) . (DeChurch & Haas, 2008; Martin, 
2011; J. E. Mathieu & Schulze, 2006)  used an episodic model of team processes and argued that 
dynamic planning, including contingency and reactive planning, was sig nificantly related to 
performance in their study of a project. Furthermore, (Mathieu et al., 200 8) demonstrated how 
initial team activities, such as the quality of deliberate performance plans and team charters, were 
positively associated with the forms of team performance displayed over time.  Putting  together, 
these studies suggest that transitio n processes are a critical component of effective teamwork. By 
setting the stage for subsequent actions and helping establish norms related to time management 
and coordination, transition processes can contribute to better team performance over time.  
2.1.2  Action processes  
While transition processes have not been the primary focus of research in teams, action processes 
such as communication and coordination have been well -studied and found to play key roles in 
team performance  (LePine et al., 2008) . Research has shown that effective communication and 
coordination  within teams are essential to successful problem management and work group 
effectiveness (Ellis et al., 2005; Hagemann & Kluge, 2017; Hung, 2013; Mishra et al., 2012; 
Piccoli et al., 2004) . The quality of communication can vary greatly between teams depending on 
factors such as the frequency of exchanges, formalization, and communication structure, all of 
which can impact the quality of action processes (Hoegl & Gemuenden, 2001) . 
Numerous studies have shown that high levels of (Daniel et al., 2013; Espinosa et  al., 2006; Wu 
et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2012) . Additionally, coordination has been identified as a critical 
component for project success, as it allows teams to effectively respond to problems that arise 
during task progression  (Alaloul et al., 2016; Bose, 2002; Ika et al., 2012; K. N. Jha & Iyer, 2006) . 
Effective coordination can lead to better problem management and higher levels of performance.  
Participation and reward systems are also important factors in team performance. (De Dreu & 
West, 2001)  found that team member participation, particularly in the presence of minority 
opposition, can increase team creativity. Similarly, (Johnson et al., 2006)  reward system can affect 
their level of information sharing and as a result, s hape the speed and accuracy of their decision -
making. Additionally, backup behaviour s have been found to be significantly related to decision -
making performance (Connor & Becker, 2003) . 
2.1.3 Interpersonal processes  
The interpersonal process component of team dynamics encompasses conflict, motivation, 
confidence building, and affect. While all these co mponents have been the focus of research, 
conflict has received the most attention. Studies have shown that both relationship and task 
conflicts have positive and negative correlations with team performance and member satisfaction  
(De Dreu, 2006; De Dreu & Van Vianen, 2001; De Dreu & Weingart, 2003; DeChurch & Marks, 
2001; Jiang et al., 2013; O’Neill et al., 2013) . Task conflict has been found to be influenced by 
informational diversity and has a significant impact on pe rformance. Relationship conflict, on the 
other hand, has been found to mediate the relationship between ambient sexual hostility and team 
financial performance  (Bradley -Geist et al., 2015) .  
Apart from conflict, research has also explored other interpersonal processes that impact team 
dynamics. Feedback has been found to have a significant impact on motivation, interpersonal trust, 
and overall performance in virtual teams  (Geister et al., 2006; Hertel et al., 2005; Jarvenpaa et al., 
1998) . A combined metric of interpersonal processes has been positively associated with 
performance, and it provides the cross -level mechanism by which  team -level resistance to 
empowerment climate is linked to individual -level satisfaction.  Temporal components of team and 
task have also been found to be crucial to the effect of interpersonal mediations on team performance. Previous studies have been carr ied out with teams that briefly completed contrived 
tasks and were then disbanded, but more recent studies have shown that interpersonal processes 
significantly relate to team performance when teams are involved in longer -term tasks  (Bradley et 
al., 2003; De Guinea et al., 2012; Druskat & Kayes, 2000; J. E. Mathieu & Rapp, 2009) . 
A meta -analysis on team conflict has shown that interpersonal pr ocesses, particularly conflict, 
perform a key role in project success  (Chan et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2017) . Task conflicts have been 
found to occur without relationship conflicts and are less likely to be emotional, escalate, or impair 
group performance. Relationship conflicts are less negatively linked to group performance in 
project teams, which suggests an interesting area for future research. The definition of project 
performance or project team performance should  also be considered, and flushing out different 
types of performance metrics may uncover unique effects and help explain the influence of conflict 
on project performance.  
2.2 Transformational Leadership  
Leadership has been a topic of academic study for man y decades, but there is a lack of empirical 
work on leadership in project management contexts. Although full -range leadership theory is a 
widely recognized theory of leadership, it encompasses transformational, transactional, and 
laissez -faire styles  (Antonakis, 2001; Bass & Avolio, 1994; Deluga, 1990; Eagly et al., 2003) . For 
the purpose of this discussion, the focus is on transformational leadership since studies have shown 
its high relevance for project -oriented organisation s. In the literature, there is general agreement 
on four dimensions t hat make up transformational leadership: idealized influence, intellectual 
stimulation, inspirational motivation, and individualized consideration. Idealized influence is 
behaviour  that arouses strong emotions and identification with the leader. Inspiratio nal motivation 
is shown when a leader conveys a vision that is appealing and inspiring to subordinates and 
provides them with challenging assignments and increased expectations. Intellectual stimulation 
is behaviour  that increases followers' awareness of p roblems and influences them to develop 
innovative and creative approaches to solving them. Individualized consideration includes 
providing support, encouragement, and coaching to followers.  
These dimensions of transformational leadership have been identifi ed as important for project -
oriented organisation s, and studies have shown that leaders who exhibit these behaviour s are more 
likely to succeed in such contexts  (Turner & Müller, 2005) . However, there is still much to be 
explored in terms of how these leadership styles can be effectively applied in project management 
contexts  (Den Hartog et al., 1997) . Further research is needed to understand how transformational 
leadership can be harnessed to improve project outcomes and how it may interact with other 
important factors in projec t success  (Brock & Von Wangenheim, 2019; Hassan et al. , 2017; Shafi 
et al., 2020) .  
2.3 Change in team members  due to the Influence of Transformation Leadership behaviour  
2.3.1 Attitude  
Attitudes are reflections of how individuals perceive their environment, and they can be assessed 
through statements about objects, people, or events. For example, when someone says "I like my 
job," they are expressing their attitude about their work. Acco rding to studies, attitudes generally 
have three dimensions: cognition, affect, and behaviour  (Breckler, 1984) . The cognitive part 
explains the way things are, such as "My pay is low," and sets the stage for the more critical aspect 
of an attitude.  The affective part is the feeling component of an attitude, and it's revealed in 
statements like "I am angry over how little I'm paid." This feeling can lead to behaviour al outputs, 
as the behaviour al dime nsion of an attitude explains an intention to behave in a particular way 
toward something, such as "I'm going to look for another job that pays better." While earlier studies on attitudes argued that they were positively related to behaviour , a review of l iterature in the late 
1960s criticized this assumed effect of attitudes on behaviour  (Wicker, 1969) . 
Research has mostly established that people seek consistency among their attitudes and between 
their attitudes and their behaviour . They may eith er change their attitudes or behaviour  or create a 
rationalization for the discrepancy (Fabrigar et al., 2006) . The most powerful moderators of the 
attitudes  relationship are the significance of the attitude, its correspondence to behaviour , its 
accessibility, the presence of social pressures, and whether a person has direct experience with the 
attitude.  Attitudes that reflect fundamental values, self -interest , or identification with individuals 
or groups we value tend to show a strong association with our behaviour . Particularly, attitudes 
tend to predict specific behaviour s, whereas general attitudes tend to best predict general 
behaviour s. For example, askin g someone about their intention to stay with an organisation  for the 
next six months is likely to better predict turnover for that person than asking about their overall 
job satisfaction. On the other hand, overall job satisfaction would better predict a g eneral 
behaviour , such as whether the individual was engaged in their work or motivated to contribute to 
their organisation (Harrison et al., 2006) . 
The attitude -behaviour  relationship is likely to be much stronger if an attitude refers to something 
with which we have direct personal experience. Discrepancies between attitudes and behaviour  
tend to happen  when social pressures to behave in a specific manner hold exceptional power, as in 
most situations. Ultimately, attitudes reflect how we perceive our environment, and understanding 
their dimensions can help predict our behaviour  in different contexts  (Klöckner, 2013) . 
2.3.2  Perception  
Perception is the process by which individuals form and interpret their sensory impressions in 
order to give meaning to their surroundings  (Ingold, 2002) . However, what we perceive can be 
considerably different from objective reality.  Perception can be influenced by a number of factors 
that can reside in the pe rceiver, in the object or target being perceived, or in the context of the 
situation in which the perception is made  (Nisbett & Miyamoto, 2005) . Personal characteristics 
such as attitudes, personality, motives, interests, past  experiences, and expectations can deeply 
influence interpretation  (Crewson, 1997) . Characteristics of the target can also affect perception. 
People are more likely to notice loud people or extremely attractive or unattractive individuals in 
a group. The relationship of a target to its background can also influence perception.  
The time, location, light, heat, and situational factors also matter as context influences perception. 
Attribution th eory explains how people are judged differently, depending on the meaning of the 
attribute given to a behaviour  (Kelley & Michela, 1980) . Attribution depends on three factors: 
distinctiveness, consensus, and consistency.  The halo effect operates when we draw a general 
impression about an individual on the basis of a single characteristic such as intelligence, 
sociability, or appearance. Contrast effect can distort perceptions as our reaction is influenced by 
other persons we have recently encountered. Stereotyping occurs when we judge someone on the 
basis of our perception of the group to which he or she belongs  (Weiner, 20 12). 
2.3.3 Motivation  
Motivation is a complex and fascinating area of study, as it touches on the very heart of what drives 
human behaviour  (Weiner, 2012) . Understanding what m otivates people can be incredibly 
powerful, whether it's in the context of individual achievement or team success. By exploring the 
underlying factors that influence our choices and actions, we can gain insight into how to create 
environments that promote positive motivation and encourage people to perform at their best  (Deci 
& Ryan, 2013) . The concept of motivation is both  simple and complex. At its simplest level, it is 
concerned with why people do what they do. However, as we delve deeper into the topic, we 
discover that motivation is a multifaceted and dynamic process that involves a range of internal and external factor s (Lang, 1995) . These can include things like personal goals, social influences, 
past experiences, and the perception of reward or punishment.  
One of the key factors that underpins motivational theory is the notion of individuality. People are 
unique, with their own set of beliefs,  values, and personality traits that shape their behaviour . As 
such, it is important to recognize that what motivates one person may not necessarily motivate 
another. By understanding the specific needs and desires of individuals, we can tailor our approac h 
to motivation and create a more effective and engaging environment  (Dutton et al., 1994) . 
Another important aspect of motivation is the idea of intentionality. People are not passive 
recipients of motivational factors, but rather active participants who choose to engage in certain 
behaviour s based on their own desires and goals  (Crant, 2000) . Of course, motivation is not a static 
process. It is influenced by a range of internal and external factors that can change over time. This 
is why it is important to recognize that  motivation is multifaceted, and that it involves both arousal 
(what gets people activated) and the direction or choice of behaviour  (the force of an individual to 
engage in desired behaviour ). By understanding these underlying factors, we can predict beha viour  
and create an environment that supports positive motivation . 
3.0 Research Hypotheses  
The section  discusses the hypotheses of a study that explores the relationship between 
transformational leadership, change in change in change in change in team members  as a result of 
transformational leadership behaviour from the project manager , and team processes . It suggests 
that, change in change in change in change in team members  as a result of transformational 
leadership behaviour mediates the relationship between transformational leadership and team 
processes . 
3.1 Transformational leadership and Team Processe s 
A stud ies by (Jung & Sosik, 2002; Wang & Huang, 2009)  found that transformational leadership 
behaviour s were positively associated with team cohesion, which is a critical team process that 
refers to the extent to which change in change in change in team members  stick together and remain 
committed to achieving shared goals. In addition, a meta -analysis of 5 8 studies by  (Lowe et al., 
1996)  found that transformational leadership was positively related to team performance.  
Transformational leaders have be en found to foster a team culture that encourages open 
communication, trust, and a shared vision, all of which are critical components of effective team 
processes  (Bass & Avolio, 1993; Wang & Huang, 2009) . By inspiring change in change in change 
in team members  to adopt a shared vision, transformational leaders can enhance team commitment 
and cohesion. They can also promot e innovation by encouraging change in change in change in 
team members  to think creatively and challenge the status quo, which can lead to improved team 
processes and outcomes (Bass & Avolio, 1993) . 
According to  (S. Jha, 2014) , transformational leaders can empower change in team members  by 
delegating responsibilities and providing them with the necessary resources and support to achieve 
their goals. This can help to enhance team self -efficacy, or the belief that the team has th e skills 
and abilities to successfully complete a task. As a result, change in change in change in team 
members  are more likely to take ownership of their work and feel a sense of pride and 
accomplishment in their achievements, which can further enhance te am cohesion and commitment.  
Additionally , transformational leaders can also influence team processes by promoting a positive 
and supportive team climate. By creating a culture of respect, fairness, and support, 
transformational leaders can help to foster a  sense of psychological safety among change in change 
in change in team members , which can encourage open communication, collaboration, and 
constructive feedback. This can help to facilitate effective problem -solving and decision -making 
processes within th e team, which can ultimately lead to improved team outcomes.  H1: Transformational leadership positively influences Team Processes  
3.2 Transformational Leadership and Change in team members  
Transformational leadership can cause positive changes in team members ' attitudes, perceptions, 
and motivation towards tasks. A meta -analysis by Judge and Piccolo (2004) of 45 studies found 
that transformational leadership was positively related to follower  attitudes and performance.  One 
study by (Leithwood & Jantzi, 2006)  found that transformational leadership was positively related 
to teachers' motivation to improve their practice. The study by (Avolio et al., 1991)  found that 
transformational leadership was positively related to follower job satisfaction, commi tment, and 
motivation.  
Furthermore, transformational leaders have been found to encourage change in team members  to 
adopt a more proactive approach towards tasks and challenges, which can lead to increased 
motivation and performance (Judge & Piccolo, 2004) . Transformational leaders have been found 
to create a supportive and empowering work environment that enables change in team members  
to take ownership of their work, feel m ore engaged, and have a sense of purpose.  
H2: Transformational leadership positively influences Change in team members  
3.3 Change in team members  and Team Processes  
In a study by (Paulsen et al., 2009) , it was found team members  perceived their team as more 
cohesive and had a shared sense of identity, they were more likely to engage in cooperative 
behaviour s, which improved team processes.  Furthermore, research by (Amabile & Kramer, 2011)  
showed that change in team members ' intrinsic motivation was a key factor in promoting creativity 
and innovation in teams. When chang e in team members  were intrinsically motivated, they were 
more likely to engage in behaviour s that promoted open communication, risk -taking, and idea -
sharing, which can improve team processes and outcomes.  
In addition, studies have shown that change in tea m members ' attitudes and perceptions toward 
tasks can significantly influence their engagement and commitment to achieving team goals. For 
example, a study by Amabile, (Amabile & Kramer, 2011) found that change in team members  who 
perceived their work as meaningful and important were more likely to be engaged in their work 
and to persist in the fa ce of challenges, which can positively impact team processes.  
A study by (Ilies et al., 2005)  found that change in team members ' positive attitudes and 
perceptions towards their work were associated with higher levels of team cohesion and task 
perfor mance. Similarly, a meta -analysis by (Mullen & Copper, 1994)  found that change in team 
members ' motivation to achieve group goals was a critical predictor of team performance.  When 
team members  have a positive atti tude towards their work, they are more likely to be committed 
to achieving shared goals and work together more effectively, leading to improved team processes. 
Moreover, motivated change in change in change in team members  tend to be more engaged and 
invol ved in the team's work, which can lead to better communication, collaboration, and 
coordination among change in change in change in team members , all of which are critical 
components of effective team processes.  A study by (Spreitzer et al., 2005)  found that team 
members  who perceived their work as meaningful and had a sense of personal control over their 
work were more motivated and engaged, leading to improved team processes.  
H3: Change in team members  positively influence Team Processes  
3.4 Change in Change in change i n change in team members  as a Mediator  
A study by (Gooty et al., 2009)  found that transformational leadership behaviour s were positively 
associated with employee attitudes towards work. This suggests that transformational leadership 
can influence employee attitudes, which can have a significant impact on team processes.  In 
addition, a study by (Ehrhart, 2004)  found that transformational leadership had a direct effect on 
employee motivation. This suggests that transformational leadership can influence employee 
motivation, which can in turn affect team processes.  (Schaubroeck et al., 2011)  found that the positive effect of transformational leadership on team processes was partially mediat ed by team 
members ' trust in the leader.  A study by (Kim & Yukl, 1995)  found that the positive relationship 
between transformational leadership and team effectiveness was mediated by change in change in 
change in team members ' self -efficacy, which refers to their belief in their ability to perform the 
task successfully. The study found that transformational leaders can enhance change in change in 
change in team members ' self -efficacy by providing them with positive feedback an d support, 
which, in turn, can improve team processes.  
Additionally,  (Carmeli et al., 2014)  found that the mediating effect of psychological empowerment 
explained the relationship between transformational leadership and team processes. This suggests 
that transformational leadership can influence em ployee attitudes, motivation, and perception, 
which can then lead to psychological empowerment, ultimately affecting team processes.  Overall, 
change in change in change in change in team members  in terms of their attitude, perception, and 
motivation caused  by transformational leadership behaviour  will mediate the relationship between 
transformational leadership and team processes.

Team Processes  
4.0 Methods  
4.1 Questionnaire Design  
 The scales of transformational leadership measuring thirteen items with higher Cronbach’s alphas 
than the original instrument from (Arif & Mehmood, 2011; Vinger & Cilliers, 2006) ,  were adapted 
from the work of  (Aga et al., 2016) . The five -point Likert -type scales were fixed on the extremes 
of 1 (not important) to 5 (extremely important) to measure the importance of transformational 
leadership dimension and 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) was also used to measure the 
quality of transformational leadership based on the perception of members team. The items for 
measuring team process measure were adopted from (Kolo, 2017) measuring twelve items of team 
process measures. The items for measuring change in change in change i n change in team members  
was developed by the researcher after a pilot survey and expert validation. The questionnaire was 
divided into five sections. Section A is concerned with demographic information; section B sought 
information on transformational lea dership behaviour (idealised influence, intellectual stimulation, 
inspirational motivation and individualised influence); section C was on the extent to which project 
manager’s transformational leadership behaviour influences project change in change in change in 
team members ’ attitude, motivation and perception about task and section D sought information 
on team processes (communication, cohesion and conflict management). Likert scale format using 
scale of 1 – Not Important; 2 – Less Important; 3 – Importa nt; 4 – Very Important; 5 – Extremely 
Important and 1 = Strongly disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Neutral; 4 = Agree; 5 = Strongly Agree 
was used.  
 
4.2 Reliability Research Instruments    
Reliability is the degree to which outcomes are consistent and precise to  represent the sample 
frame of a study and if the results of a study can be reproduced using a similar methodology. Using 
various kinds of processes for gathering data and finding that literature through different quotas 
extends the reliability of the data  and their analysis, as suggested by (Zohrabi, 2013) This study 
used quantitative methods. Questionnaire of likert scale was the instrument used hence it was 
imperative to test the internal consistency to ascertain how well they fit the constructs used in the 
study. Cronbach’s Alpha Reliability Coefficient and composite reliability was calculated. A 
reliability coefficient range between zero (0) and one (1) is adequate (Tavakol & Dennick, 2011) . 
A coefficient of zero means that the instrument has no internal consistency while if it is o ne means 
there is internal consistency, (Kothari, 2004)  show that a reliable research instrument must have a 
composite Cronbach’s Alpha  Reliability Coefficient of at least 0 .7 for all indicators used for a study. Table  4.2 shows all the constructs for this study are higher than threshold hence affirming 
the results of the study.

4.3 Sample Frame  
The target population of this research were construction project team members . Since not all the 
change in change in change in team members  could be studied, a sample of the population was 
focused on. The study identified the following as those responsible for design and construction of 
buildings in Nigeria construction industry namely; Architects, Builders, Engineers, Project 
Managers and Qu antity Surveyors. These were recognised as the respondents and main sources of 
primary data for this research.  
4.4 Sampling Technique  
When it is not possible to collect and analyse data from an entire population in a research study 
sampling is used (Saunders & Bezzina, 2015) To this end, purposive as well as snowball samplings 
are more suitable for data collection for this study. Purposive sampling allows the researcher to 
judge and choose respondents that were work ing in construction project teams and thus were most 
likely to answer the research questions and to satisfy the objectives of the research (Saunders & 
Bezzina, 2015) . Self -administered questionnaires are usually a nswered by the participants 
themselves, while researcher -administered questionnaires answers were recorded by the researcher 
(Saunders & Bezzina, 2015) .  Self -administered questionnaires were adopted for this rese arch 
because it does not allow the researcher to influence the respondent to cause bias (MacIntosh & 
O’Gorman, 2015) .  
4.5 Sample Size  
Since the population of this study ( change in change in change in team members  of construction 
projects) is unknown the procedure developed by Cochran (1977)  see (Kotrlik & Higgins, 2001) , 
for determining the sample of an infinite population wa s adopted. The formula is given as follows:  
𝑁=𝑧2×𝑝×𝑞
𝑒2 
Where:  N = Sample Size, z = selected critical value of desired confidence level (1.95) , p = 
estimated  proportion of an attribute that is present in the population (0.5) , q = 1 - p and e = desired 
level of precision (0.08) .  
Therefore N = 149 .  
40 percent of N was added to cover for non -return rate which is 60 hence N  = 209 
 
4.6 Data Analysis Technique  
This study used both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis to test the study  hypothesis. 
Non parametric descriptive analysis was also used to determine central tendency and measures of 
dispersion. The arithmetic mean was measure for central tendency while standard deviation was 
the measure of dispersion. Partial Least Square Path Modeling (SMART PLS 3) was used to 
analyse the effect of mediating variable on the relationship between independent variables and the 
dependent variable. The choice of PLS analysis method was chosen since it was used to measure 
and explain the link between  independent variables and dependent variable, the relationship among 
the mediating variables. Beta Coefficient was used to measure the effect of the mediating variable 
on the relationship between the independent and dependent variables under study.   In t esting the 
hypothesis PLS’s (R2), was used. Additionally, with the aid of PLS path modeling, this study aims to assess transformation leadership with the mediating role of change in change in change in team 
members  in the relationship between transformatio nal leadership and team process. This Study 
utilised PLS path modeling to evaluate the proposed model in Nigerian construction industry.  
In measuring the hypothesised model, Smart PLS 3 was utilised to determine the parameters of the 
model. In this case, P LS path modelling was applied with a path -weighting scheme for inside 
approximation  (Ramayah et al., 2018; Tenenhaus et al., 2005; Wetzels et al., 2009) . Then, 
nonparametric bootstrapping with 10,000 replications to obtain the standard estimate errors was 
carried out (Ramayah et al., 2018) . Method of repetitive indicators was conducted to assess the 
higher order latent variable, in accordance with  (Lohmöller & Lohmöller, 1989; Tibshirani & 
Efron, 1993) .  
Endogeneity issue can be as a result of two situations in a research model: (1) it may occur if any 
bidirectional relationship is expected among some of the concepts i n the model ( (Abdallah et al., 
2015)  and (2) when there are limited disregarded variables that could also incorporated in the 
controlled model such that the  effect of “X on Y” cannot be understood as a result of missing 
causes (Antonakis, 2001) . However, limited researchers deal with endogeneity in PLS model 
(Lovaglio & Vittadini, 2013) . On the basis of this scarce studies and the assertion on possible links 
amongst predictors and outcomes within the expla natory equations of the PLS model that can be 
influenced by unmodeled constituents in the predictor blocks, the present study deleted those 
additional factors from the predictor blocks. Thus, additional factors have been fully integrated 
into the hypothesi sed model that the endogeneity issue has been removed (Lovaglio & Vittadini, 
2013) . 
5.0 Results  
5.1 Demographic of the Respondents  
The results presented in Table 5.1, details the demographics of a study on construction project 
change in change in change in team members . The study identified five portfolios: Architects, 
Builders, Engineers, Project Managers, and Quantity Surveyors. The  data shows that the highest 
proportion of change in change in change in team members  were Architects, followed by Quantity 
Surveyors, Builders, and Engineers. The majority of respondents were between 31 -40 years old 
and held a bachelor's degree. Regarding  experience, most had 5 -10 years of experience working 
in design teams, and the majority worked for contracting or consultancy organisation s in medium 
or large projects, mainly in residential and institutional buildings. Only 3.5% of team leadership 
was pr ovided by project managers.

5.3 Correlation analysis  
As pr opose d, there are significant and positive correlations among transformational leadership, 
change in change in change in team members , and team processes. Specifically, transformational leadership was found to be positively and significantly correlated with change in change in change 
in team members  (r = .294**, p < 001) and with team processes (r = .178**, p < 001). Additionally, 
team processes and change in change in change in team members  were significantly correlated (r 
= .308**, p < 001). The study's proposed model was tested using Partial Least Squares (SMART 
PLS 3) software, and the results are displayed in Table 5.4.

5.4 Overall Path Model  
The structural equation model is considered as the second major process of structural equation 
modeling analysis. Once validation process of the measurement model is confirmed, then 
representation of the structural model can be established by identifying t he relationships between 
the concepts. The structural model provides details on the relationships between the constructs 
(Lowry & Gaskin, 2014) . It shows the specific details of the relationship among the independent 
or exogenous and dependent or endogenous variables (Sarstedt et al., 2020) . Evaluation of the 
structural model focus firstly on the overall model fit, followed by the size, direction and 
significance of the proposed parameter estimates, as displayed by the one - headed arrows in the 
path diagrams (Hair et al., 2014). The final part included the confirmation process of the structural 
model of the study, which was established on the projected relationship among the identified and 
assessed variables. In the present st udy, the structural model was supposed to test the research 
hypothesizes, through Partial Least Square (SMART PLS 3) Path Modeling technique and 
bootstrapping with 10000 replications.  
In order to specify the research hypotheses targeted in chapter one of this work, a research 
structural model was developed in this study. The research structural model is proposed to test four 
hypotheses related to direct effects from transformational leadership, change in change in change 
in team members  on team processes a nd transformational leadership on change in change in change 
in team members . The study also examined the mediation effects of change in change in change 
in team members  on the relationship between transformational leadership and team processes. 
Figure 1 illustrates the hypothesised direct and mediation effects in the research Path Modeling.  
Partial Least Square Path Modeling is a data analytic approach generally used to assess patterns of 
relationships that exist among variables (Lowry & Gaskin, 2014) . The latent constructs in 
individual CFA models were all measured by several multi -item scales. The inclusion of a ll items 
and relative errors in the measurement and structural models leads to a complex and non -stable 
model because too many parameters need to be estimated. Thus, to overcome this problem, this 
research utilised parcels as indicators of latent construct s in individual CFA models. Parcels are 
aggregations (sums or averages) of several individual items. Using parcels as indicators of latent 
construct commonly have better reliability as compared with the single items (Coffman & 
MacCallum, 2005) . As the result of using item -parcelling procedure, the latent constructs in 
individual CFA models of (transformational leadership, change in change in change in team 
members  and team processes) were converted into observed variables so that they could easily 
construct the overall measurement and structural model and reduce the model complexity. 
Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the overall measurement model. Th e model 
comprises all of the first and second order constructs proposed in this study. Figure 5.4 depicts the 
overall Path model.  
Figure 5.4: Overall Path Model   
5.4.1 Reliability and Convergent Validity  
Table 5.4.1  represents the result of Cronbach’s alpha and convergent validity for the Overall CFA 
model. The results of assessing the standardized factor loadings of the model’s items indicated that 
the initial standardised factor loadings of some items were below 0. 6, ranged from 0.267 to 0.594 
but other item were above 0.6. Once the uni -dimensionality of the constructs was achieved, each 
of the constructs was assessed for their reliability. Reliability is assessed using average variance 
extracted (AVE), composite re liability (CR) and Cronbach’s alpha. Table 5.5 shows that the AVE 
values were 0.285, 0.337, and 0.329 for transformational leadership, change in change in change 
in team members  and team processes respectively. All of these values were below the cut -off of  
0.5 as suggested by (Lowry & Gaskin, 2014)  however, Average Variance Extracted (AVE) is strict 
measure of reliability, and the other two measures (Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability) 
were used to assess the reliability of the constructs. The Cronbach’s Alpha values were 0.817, 
0.855 and 0.8 25 for transformational leadership, change in change in change in team members  and 
team processes respectively. These values were all above the threshold of 0.7 as suggested by 
(Charter, 1999) . The composite reliability values were, 0.811, 0.847, and 0.825 for 
transformational leadership, change in change in change in team members  and team processes 
respectively. These values exceeded the recommended value of 0.6 for all constructs as 
recommended by (Lowry & Gaskin, 2014).

5.4.2 Discriminant Validity  
Heterotrait -Monotrait Ration (HTMT) criteria is a measure of discriminant validity that says 
actually whether this are the same or differently in factors, if the value are less than one (<1) 
(Voorhees et al., 2016)  that indicate that this are different factors, notice the more lower they are, 
the more different they are, so in this case there is discrimi nant validity because the (HTMT) values 
0.666, 0.555, and 0.584 are less than 1 (see below; table 5.4.2).

5.5 Hypothesis Testing  
Hypothesis 1 , states that transformational leadership positively influences team processes. Results 
of the Partial Least Square Path Modelling (SMART PLS 3) analysis are depicted in Table 5.5 The 
result indicates that transformational leadership has a significant and positive relationship with 
team processes (β = 0.630, P < 0.000) and the r2 value (0.397) satisfies the requirement for the 
0.30 cut off value as recommended by (Lowry & Gaskin, 2014) which uniquely explains 39.7 
percent of the variance in team processes. Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is supported.  
Hypothesis 2  proposes that transformational leadership is positively related to change in change 
in change in team members . The results of Partial Least Square Path Modelling (SMART PLS 3) Table 5.5 indicate a strong and highly significant relationship between transformational leadership 
and change in change in change in team members  do exist (β = 0.633, P < 0.000) and the r2  value 
(0.401) satisfies the requirement for the 0.30 cut off value as recommended by (Lowry & Gaskin, 
2014) which uniquely contributed 40.1 percent of the variance in change in change in change in 
team members . Hypothesis 2 is therefore supported.  
Hypoth esis 3  states that change in change in change in team members  are positively related to 
team processes. The results of Partial Least Square Path Modelling (SMART PLS 3) Table 5.5 
indicate that change in change in change in team members  with r2 value (0.479 ) satisfies the 
requirement for the 0.30 cut off value as recommended by (Lowry & Gaskin, 2014) which uniquely 
contributed 47.9 percent of the variance in team processes and show a strong and highly significant 
relationship between change in change in chan ge in team members  and team processes (β = 0.692, 
P < 0.001). Hypothesis 3 is therefore supported.

5.6 Mediating Effects  
Table 5.6 presents the results of investigating the mediating effect of change in change in change 
in team members  on the relationship between transformational leadership and team processes 
(Hypothesis 4). Before conducting the analysis, the conditions for mediation analysis were 
examined. The first condition was met, as the results indicate a significant positive influence of 
transformational leadership on team processes (β = 0.630, P < 0.000), demonstrating a correlation 
between the independent and dependent variables. The second condition was also satisfied, as the 
results in Table 5.6 reveal a significant positive relationship between transformational leadership 
and change i n change in change in team members  (β = 0.633, P < 0.000), providing evidence for 
a significant relationship between the independent variable and the mediator variable. The third 
condition was confirmed by the results in Table 5.6, which show a significant relationship between 
change in change in change in team members , the mediator variable, and team processes (β = 
0.692, P < 0.001). When the mediator ( change in change in change in team members ) was 
introduced in the model, the di rect relationship between the independent variable (transformational 
leadership) and dependent variable (team processes) was substantially reduced, from (β = 0.630, 
P < 0.000, as seen in Table 5.6) to (β = 0.299, P < 0.000, as seen in Table 5.6.1 ), indicat ing the 
presence of a mediating effect (Lowry & Gaskin, 2014).

In order to confirm the mediating effect, the specific indirect effect of a × b in equation (1)  had to 
be significant. As shown in Table 5.6.2 , the Z statistic procedure  proposed by (Sobel, 1982)  was 
comput ed and found to be significant at p < 0.000. The Z value 4.02 is  greater than the t -value of 
>1.96 (for 2 -tailed), which is equivalent to p < 0.05. Therefore, Hypothesis H4 was accepted, 
indicating that there is an indirect influence from transformational leadership through change in 
change in team members  on team processes. It is worth noting that there are three main types of 
the Sobel test, including adding the third denominator part (Aroian, 1947)  as suggested by 
(Preacher & Leonardelli, 2001) , subtracting the third denominator part (Goodman, 1960) , and not 
considering the denominator. Before the Sobel test wa s applied to parameter estimates obtained 
from modeling, the procedures given by (MacKi nnon et al., 2002)  and (Krull & MacKinnon, 1999)  
were considered. The Z value (Krull & MacKinnon, 1999)  is mathematically defined as follows:  
𝑍−𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 =𝐴×𝐵

As shown in Figure 5.4, there was a significant influence from transformational leadership on 
change in team members  (0.575, p <0.01) and change in team members  on team processes (0.506, 
p <0.01). The Z value score also greater than 1.96 (p <0.05); thus, the ultimate result approves the 
mediating effect of change in team members  on the relationship between transformational 
leadership and team processes, which in turn indicates that it has an indirect effect on team 
processes.  To calculate the component of the indirect effect, the variance accounted for (VAF) 
value was considered, which is the ratio of indirect effect to total effect.  The VAF value depicts 
that 49. 3% of the total effect of transformational leadership on team processes was as the result of 
the indirect effect of change in team members .                           𝐴×𝐵

5.7 Discussion  
The study's first hypothesis, which posited that Transformational Leadership would enhance the 
likelihood of positive Team Processes, was strongly supported by the results. The study aimed to 
explore the connection between transformational leadership and t eam processes by examining the 
mediating influence of changes in change in team members . The findings showed a positive 
correlation between a project manager's transformational leadership style and team processes, 
indicating that the leader's influence is essential in fostering effective team processes. A 
transformational project manager motivates and inspires change in team members  to adopt a general notion of team processes that involve effective communication, cohesion, and conflict 
management. This resu lt underscores the importance of project managers' leadership styles, an 
area that previous project management literature has neglected, as highlighted by (Turner & 
Müll er, 2005) . 
Furthermore, the study found that the influence of transformational leadership on changes in 
change in team members  positively impacts team processes, which supports the findings of (Yang 
et al., 2011) . Transformational leadership is one of the most critical styles of leadership as it 
constantly seeks significant changes in teams and involves change in team members  in decision -
making. Transfor mational leaders articulate a vision that is attractive, desirable, and achievable to 
change in team members . They make valuable contributions to the success of teams by motivating 
and encouraging change in team members  and creating a supportive work envir onment that fosters 
coordination and assistance.  
Transformational leadership techniques such as increasing motivation and task performance also 
enhance team cohesion. Such leaders encourage team identity and encourage change in team 
members  to transcend th eir self -identity. In summary, the findings of this study demonstrate that 
transformational leadership is a crucial component of effective team processes and that project 
managers should strive to develop and apply this leadership style to foster positive outcomes.  
Transformational leaders inspire their change in team members  to work in the best interest of the 
team by serving as role models and providing psychological ownership to their followers. By 
identifying their followers' needs and strengths, these leaders guide their behaviour  towards 
teamwork, resulting in the succes sful completion of projects. The relationship between 
transformational leaders and their followers is based on strong ethical and moral principles, which 
increase motivation for both parties, enabling them to collaborate in the best interest of the team.  
Through articulating an attractive vision, transformational leaders can change their change in team 
members ' attitudes, perceptions, and behaviour s by directing them towards the common goal of 
the team. Unlike other forms of leadership, such as transactiona l leadership, which focus on 
economic and transactional exchanges, transformational leaders are able to change the personality 
of their change in team members  by presenting challenging tasks and an appealing vision.  
Transformational leaders have an idealiz ed influence and serve as role models for their followers, 
directing their efforts towards the team's success. They also provide an encouraging environment 
that helps achieve various desirable outcomes, such as improved job performance, creativity, and 
organisation al citizenship behaviour  among employees. These behaviour s contribute to the success 
of project -based organisation s, helping them realize their goals in an effective and efficient 
manner.  
Transformational leadership is characterized by strong mora l values and concern for change in 
team members , which results in high levels of trust, respect, and admiration from change in team 
members  towards their leaders. This leadership style involves changing the ways of working by 
providing new directions for change in team members  to perform their roles for the benefit of the 
project and achieving their own goals. Under transformational leaders, followers are willing to 
perform beyond expectations and their formal roles, using their full energy and putting all their 
efforts into their work. They sacrifice their self -interest for the collective interest of the team, 
increasing the chances of success.  
Individual consideration is a key characteristic of transformational leadership, with leaders 
showing strong consi deration for follower needs and encouraging new ideas and methods from 
their followers through intellectual stimulation. Transformational leaders also challenge the status 
quo, encouraging their followers to come up with new ideas and presenting ways of do ing things 
in new ways. By providing a supportive environment, change in team members  are encouraged to 
engage in creative work performance, and leaders provide incremental and psychological support when needed.  Transformational leadership has four highly effective components. First, leaders 
serve as role models, exhibiting idealized influence. Second, they motivate followers through 
inspirational motivation. Third, they show strong concern for the needs, feelings, and emotions of 
followers through individu alized consideration. Finally, they increase the intellectual level and 
knowledge, skills, and abilities of their followers.  
This positive leadership style is highly influential in project -based organisation s, triggering 
intrinsic motivation, developing em ployee skills, increasing moral standards, initiating changes, 
increasing maturity levels, creating a supportive climate for teamwork, promoting sacrifice of self -
interest for team goals, promoting coordination and cohesion, being consistent with words and  
actions, coaching subordinates, transforming lives, and considering the input of followers through 
task significance.  
The fourth hypothesis of the current study was confirmed as significant, as the basic assumptions 
of mediation were satisfied before test ing the mediating role of change in team members . This 
study suggests that changes in change in team members ' attitudes, motivation, and perception 
towards work can result in a highly empowered and dedicated project team. Improving these 
factors can also e nhance change in team members ' knowledge of team processes, interpersonal 
communication, and problem -solving skills, leading to improved team processes. Additionally, the 
study found that changes in change in team members  mediate the relationship between a  project 
manager's transformational leadership and team processes. This is the first study to recognize the 
mediating role of changes in change in team members  in the connection between transformational 
leadership and team processes. This finding contribut es to understanding how transformational 
leadership impacts team processes and shows that project managers who demonstrate 
transformational leadership behaviour  are more likely to create changes in change in team 
members ' attitudes, motivation, and percept ion towards work that support the achievement of team 
processes.  
Transformational leaders are known for their individualized consideration for each of their 
followers and their ability to show respect and concern for their followers' needs. They serve as 
role models for morality, ethics, justice, and fairness, both on and off the job, and support their 
followers in effectively resolving problems. These leaders also develop their followers' 
personality, knowledge, skills, and abilities, leading to positive a ttitudes such as trust, loyalty, 
respect, team identification, and commitment to the team and leader. These attitudes lead to 
favorable employee behaviour s such as organisation al citizenship behaviour , personal initiative, 
voice behaviour s, low turnover intention, and teamwork. All of these attitudes and behaviour s are 
based on the changes transformational leaders create in their change in team members , which 
promote team processes.  Transformational leaders pay attention to the needs of th eir change in 
team members , and the change in team members  respond by putting in their complete effort and 
enthusiasm, which boosts team processes such as communication, cohesion, and conflict 
management. High -quality relationships based on trust, loyalty,  respect, and affiliation between 
transformational leaders and their followers lead to improved team processes such as 
communication, cohesion, and conflict management.  
The influence of transformational leadership on change in team members  leads to changes  in their 
attitudes, motivation, and perception towards tasks, which enhance team processes. This change is 
highly required in project -based organisation s in order to foster team processes. Such changes lead 
to desirable behaviour s such as affective commit ment with team leaders, increased job satisfaction 
and supervisor perception, and perception in terms of rewards and procedures, which further 
improve team processes. The influence of transformational leadership on change in team members  
also leads to incr eased innovative behaviour  and creativity in teams, as change in team members  
feel comfortable with their leaders and are more likely to come up with interesting ideas. Such relationships are building blocks for team processes and lead to improved conflict  management, 
cohesion, and communication among change in team members . 
5.8 Conclusion  and Future Research  
In conclusion, this study has provided evidence that supports the hypothesis that transformational 
leadership enhances positive team processes. The fi ndings demonstrate that transformational 
leadership is a crucial component of effective team processes, and project managers should strive 
to develop and apply this leadership style to foster positive outcomes. Transformational leaders 
inspire their change  in team members  to work in the best interest of the team by serving as role 
models and providing psychological ownership to their followers. Furthermore, this study 
recogni sed the mediating role of changes in change in team members  in the connection betwe en 
transformational leadership and team processes. This finding contributes to understanding how 
transformational leadership impacts team processes and shows that project managers who 
demonstrate transformational leadership behaviour  are more likely to cre ate changes in change in 
team members ' attitudes, motivation, and perception towards work that support the achievement 
of team processes. Overall, the study underscores the importance of transformational leadership in 
project -based organisation s and highli ghts the significant impact that transformational leaders can 
have on team processes and outcomes.  
Future research could investigate how transformational leadership affects different types of teams 
and team processes. It would be interesting to examine whether the impact of transformational 
leadership varies based on the size, type, or complexity of the team, and whether the effect is more 
significant for certain team processes, such as communication or conflict management.  Future 
research could investigate the role of team members' personality traits, values, and attitudes in 
mediating the relationship between transformational leadership and team processes. It would be 
interesting to examine whether some team members are more receptive to transfo rmational 
leadership than others and how their individual characteristics influence the effectiveness of this 
leadership style.  Finally, future research could explore the impact of training and development 
programs on project managers' ability to demonstra te transformational leadership behaviour s. It 
would be valuable to investigate how project managers can be trained and developed to enhance 
their leadership skills and foster more effective team processes.
