ABSTRACT
In this paper, we carry out a detailed analysis of the M1.6 cla ss eruptive ﬂare occurring in NOAA active region
13078 on 2022 August 19. The ﬂare is associated with a fast cor onal mass ejection (CME) propagating in the
southwest direction with an apparent speed of ∼926 km s−1. Meanwhile, a shock wave is driven by the CME at
the ﬂank. The eruption of CME generates an extreme-ultravio let (EUV) wave expanding outward from the ﬂare
site with an apparent speed of ≥200 km s−1. As the EUV wave propagates eastward, it encounters and inte racts
with the low-lying adjacent coronal loops (ACLs), which are composed of two loops. The compression of
EUV wave results in contraction, expansion, and transverse vertical oscillations of ACLs. The commencements
of contraction are sequential from western to eastern footp oints and the contraction lasts for ∼15 minutes.
The speeds of contraction lie in the range of 13 −40 km s−1in 171 Å and 8−54 km s−1in 193 Å. A long,
gradual expansion follows the contraction at lower speeds. Concurrent vertical oscillations are superposed on
contraction and expansion of ACLs. The oscillations last fo r 2−9 cycles and the amplitudes are ≤4 Mm. The
periods are between 3 to 12 minutes with an average value of 6. 7 minutes. The results show rich dynamics of
coronal loops.

1.INTRODUCTION
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are impulsive, large-scale
eruptions of magnetic ﬁeld and corona plasma into the he-
liosphere (see Chen 2011 ;Georgoulis et al. 2019 , and refer-
ences therein). A majority of CMEs are produced by erup-
tions of prominences or magnetic ﬂux ropes originating from
quiet regions or active regions ( Fan 2005 ;Aulanier et al.
2010 ;Yan et al. 2018 ;Zhang 2022 ;Zhou et al. 2023 ). The
speeds of CMEs have a wide range from ∼100 km s−1to
≥3000 km s−1(Yashiro et al. 2004 ). Successive stretching
of the overlying magnetic ﬁeld lines generates a bright, ex-
panding front from the source region observed in extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths, which is named “EIT wave”
(Thompson et al. 1998 ;Chen et al. 2002 ,2005 ;Ballai et al.
2005 ). Meanwhile, a faster coronal Moreton wave is
frequently observed to propagate ahead of the EIT wave

It is generally accepted that an EUV wave consists of a
wave-like component moving at fast magnetosonic speed
(Wills-Davey & Thompson 1999 ;Zheng et al. 2023 ) and a
coherent driven compression front related to the eruption
(Downs et al. 2011 ). Occasionally, the fast-mode wave
is a shock wave accompanied by a type II radio burst
(Gopalswamy et al. 2009 ;Zucca et al. 2018 ).
Waves and oscillations are omnipresent in the solar at-
mosphere ( Andries et al. 2009 ;Ruderman & Erd´ elyi 2009 ;
Jess et al. 2015 ;Nakariakov & Kolotkov 2020 ), such as
Alfv´ en waves ( Erd´ elyi & Fedun 2007 ;Liu et al. 2019 ), slow-
mode ( Wang et al. 2003 ;Xia et al. 2022 ), and fast-mode
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves ( Edwin & Roberts
1983 ). Fast-mode kink oscillations of coronal loops
excited by ﬂares were ﬁrst observed by the Transi-
tion Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) spacecraft
(Aschwanden et al. 1999 ;Nakariakov et al. 1999 ). Kink
oscillations could also been induced by small-scale mag-
netic reconnection ( He et al. 2009 ), coronal jets ( Dai et al.
2021 ), prominence eruptions ( Zimovets & Nakariakov2 Zhangetal .
2015 ), and EUV waves ( Shen & Liu 2012 ;Kumar et al.
2013 ;Srivastava & Goossens 2013 ;Guo et al. 2015 ;Su et al.
2018 ;Devi et al. 2022 ). Coronal seismology based on kink
oscillations provides an e ﬀective way of determining the
magnetic ﬁeld strength, internal Alfv´ en speed, and densit y
scale height of the oscillating loops ( Nakariakov & Ofman
2001 ;Verwichte et al. 2004 ;Verth & Erd´ elyi 2008 ;Li et al.
2017 ;Yang et al. 2020 ;Zhang et al. 2020 ;Li & Long 2023 ).
Interaction between EIT waves and coronal loops has been
used to estimate the wave energy, which is hard to measure
directly ( Ballai et al. 2005 ;Fulara et al. 2019 ).
According to the polarization direction, transverse oscil -
lations are categorized into horizontal and vertical oscil -
lations. For the horizontal-polarized type, the direction
of oscillation is perpendicular to the loop plane. For the
vertical-polarized type, the direction of oscillation is c onsis-
tent with the loop plane ( Wang & Solanki 2004 ;White et al.
2012 ;Verwichte & Kohutova 2017 ;Zhang et al. 2022a ).
Mrozek (2011 ) reported vertical loop oscillations driven by
a failed ﬁlament eruption from below. On the other hand,
Reeves et al. (2020 ) detected Doppler oscillations of the
magnetic tuning fork created by reconnection outﬂows prop-
agating downward. Another category of vertical oscillatio n is
caused by implosion of large-scale, overlying coronal loop s
during the impulsive phase of a ﬂare ( Gosain 2012 ;Sun et al.
2012 ;Sim˜ oes et al. 2013 ). The equilibrium positions of ver-
tical oscillations are rapidly contracting inward at speed s of
a few tens to≥100 km s−1, and there is no recovery to their
original heights. Russell et al. (2015 ) proposed a uniﬁed
model (“remove-of-support” mechanism) to self-consisten tly
explain the contraction and vertical oscillation. Besides , ver-
tical loop oscillation after the strong impact of an EUV wave
has been observed ( Srivastava & Goossens 2013 ;Su et al.
2018 ).Murawski et al. (2005 ) carried out two-dimensional
(2D) numerical simulations of vertical, kink-mode loop os-
cillations that are excited impulsively. The e ﬀect of vary-
ing the initial pulse position is explored and the results ar e
consistent with previous observations by Wang & Solanki
(2004 ). Furthermore, Selwa et al. (2010 ) performed 2D nu-
merical simulations of vertical kink oscillations excited by
an oscillatory driver. Comparison with the impulsive exci-
tation by a pressure pulse (e.g., an EUV wave) shows that
attenuation of vertical kink oscillations is greatly reduc ed.
Energy leakage is a predominant mechanism of quick atten-
uation of vertical kink oscillations ( Selwa et al. 2005 ,2007 ).
Using 3D numerical modelings, Ofman et al. (2015 ) investi-
gated the vertical loop oscillations after the impact of a fa st-
mode shock wave. The periods are very close to the observed
values ( Srivastava & Goossens 2013 ).
Chandra et al. (2021 ) reported contraction and expansion
of coronal loops induced by a nearby ﬁlament eruption. They
conjectured that a coronal wave is generated during the erup -Figure 1. (a) SXR light curves of the M1.6 ﬂare in 1 −8 Å (red line)

tion, pushing the loops downward followed by a recovery to
their initial positions. Zhang et al. (2022b ) studied the erup-
tion of an EUV hot channel (ﬂux rope) on 2022 January 20,
which produced an M5.5 class ﬂare, a fast CME, and an EUV
wave. During its propagation, the EUV wave encounters and
compresses low-lying adjacent coronal loop (ACLs), result -
ing in rapid contraction, expansion, and vertical oscillat ion of
ACLs. Inspired by the “remove-of-support” mechanism, the
authors put forward a new scenario to explain the expansion
and oscillation (see their Fig. 12). They speculated that ve rti-
cal oscillation of high-lying coronal loops during contrac tion
as a result of implosion and vertical oscillation of low-lyi ng
loops during expansion after the EUV wave leaves are phys-
ically the same. Until now, vertical oscillations during bo th
contraction and expansion motions have not been observed.
In this paper, we report multiwavelength observations of
an M1.6-class ﬂare (SOL2022-08-19T04:44) on 2022 Au-
gust 19. The eruptive ﬂare and the associated CME initiated
in NOAA active region (AR) 13078 (S27W48). Transverse
vertical oscillations in low-lying ACLs were detected duri ng
both contraction and expansion phases. The paper is orga-
nized as follows. We describe observations and related data
analysis in Section 2. The results are presented in Section 3
and discussed in Section 4. Finally, a brief summary is given
in Section 5.
2.OBSERV ATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS
The M1.6 ﬂare was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012 ) on board the Solar Dy-
namics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft. AIA takes full-disk
images in seven EUV (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, and 335
Å) and two UV (1600 and 1700 Å) wavelengths with a spa-
tial resolution of 1.′′2 and time cadences of 12 s (EUV) or 24
s (UV). The level 1.0 data were calibrated using aiaprep.pro
in the Solar Software (SSW ). In its early phase, the ﬂare was
observed by the full-disk H αImaging Spectrograph (HIS)Verticaloscillationsofcoronalloops 3
on board the Chinese H αSolar Explorer (CHASE; Li et al.
2022 ). CHASE/HIS provides Hαspectroscopic observations
with a pixel spectral resolution of 0.024 Å, a spatial reso-
lution of 1.′′2, and a time cadence of one minute ( Qiu et al.
2022 ). The Hαimages were coaligned with the AIA 304 Å
images with an accuracy of ∼0.′′5. Soft x-ray (SXR) ﬂuxes
of the ﬂare in 0.5 −4 Å and 1−8 Å were detected by the
GOES-16 spacecraft with a cadence of 1 s. The CME was
observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph
(LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995 ) on board the SOHO space-
craft1. The radio dynamic spectra during eruption was ob-
tained from the Australia-ASSA ground-based station2with
a cadence of 0.25 s and a frequency coverage of 17 −87 MHz.
Figure 1(a) shows the SXR light curves of the ﬂare in 1 −8
Å (red line) and 0.5 −4 Å (blue line), respectively. The SXR
emission starts to rise at ∼04:14 UT, peaks at ∼04:44 UT
(black dashed line), and declines gradually until ∼05:50 UT.
Therefore, the lifetime of the ﬂare is over 1.5 hr.
Figure 2(a1-a6) show six AIA 131 Å images to illus-
trate the evolution of the ﬂare (see also the online anima-
tion). The arrows point to the bright and hot post-ﬂare loops
(PFLs). A magnetic ﬂux rope or hot channel was not de-
tected before and during the eruption ( Reeves & Golub 2011 ;
Zhang et al. 2022b ). Figure 2(b-c) show the bright ﬂare rib-
bons in the chromosphere observed in 1600 Å and H αline
center (6562.8 Å) at 04:31 UT, respectively. The western
ribbon is much longer and brighter than the eastern one.
Figure 3shows white-light (WL) images of the CME and
shock wave observed by LASCO /C2 coronagraph. The CME
ﬁrst appears at 04:49:30 UT and propagates in the southwest
direction with a central position angle of ∼225◦. The angu-
lar width reaches∼104◦due to the CME-driven shock. The
height evolution of CME during 04:49 −06:30 UT is plotted
with purple diamonds in Figure 1(b). A linear ﬁtting of the
height as a function of time results in an apparent speed of
∼926 km s−1. Taking the projection e ﬀect into account, the
true speed of CME reaches ∼1246 km s−1, which is suﬃcient
to drive a shock.
Figure 4shows six AIA 193 Å base-di ﬀerence images dur-
ing 04:20−04:45 UT (see also the online animation). The
arrows indicate the leading edge (LE) of the CME in its early
phase. As the CME rises and propagates in the southwest di-
rection, a bright EUV wave expands outward from the ﬂare
site and detaches from the CME bubble, leaving behind a
dark dimming region. To study the evolution of EUV wave,
a straight slice (S0) with a length of 371′′is selected in panel
(d). The time-distance plot of S0 is displayed in Figure 5(b).

UT at an apparent speed of ∼201 km s−1on the disk.

slowly from∼80 to∼45 MHz during 04:34:30 −04:43:30 UT
(Zucca et al. 2018 ). Therefore, the shock is formed at the
early phase of CME evolution below 2 R⊙, which is proba-
bly due to its initial overexpansion ( Patsourakos et al. 2010 ).
Coincidence of the EUV wave and type II radio burst sug-
gests that the bright EUV wave front is the imprint of the
CME-driven shock on the surface.
3.RESULTS
In Figure 4(a-b), the base-diﬀerence images show the
ACLs next to the ﬂare region. As the EUV wave expands
outward, it sweeps the ACLs. In Figure 6, six AIA 171 Å
base-diﬀerence images illustrate the interaction between the
EUV wave and ACLs (see also the online animation). It is
clear that as the EUV wave arrives from the ﬂare site and
compresses the ACLs, the interaction causes contraction, e x-
pansion, and oscillation of ACLs ( Zhang et al. 2022b ). In
panel (a), the footpoints (FP1 and FP2) of ACLs are marked
by two cyan circles, which are ∼193′′apart. The ACLs are
composed of two loops, L1 and L2, with L1 being higher
and longer than L2. Four slices (S1-S4) with the same length
of 87 Mm are selected to investigate the evolution of ACLs.
Time-distance plots of the four slices in 171 and 193 Å are
displayed in the left and right panels of Figure 7, respectively.
The manually extracted trajectories of L1 and L2 are denoted
with orange and black “ +” symbols, respectively. The con-
tractions of ACLs commence after 04:20 UT and persist until
∼04:36 UT. It is worth noting that the start times of contrac-
tion are sequential from S4 to S1 since S4 is closer to the ﬂare
site. The speeds of contraction of L1 are larger than those of
L2, which is most probably due to that L1 is higher than L2
and responds to the compression of EUV wave earlier than
L2. Afterwards, the ACLs expand gradually until 05:15 UT
and the speeds of expansion are evidently lower than those of
contraction. The ﬁnal heights of ACLs are equal to or lower
than the initial heights. Hence, the whole process lasts for
∼55 minutes. Interestingly, vertical oscillations are supe r-
posed on the contraction and expansion, which is di ﬀerent
from previously reported situations of oscillation during con-
traction ( Gosain 2012 ;Sun et al. 2012 ;Sim˜ oes et al. 2013 )
as well as oscillation during expansion ( Zhang et al. 2022b ).
The oscillation of L1 is obvious along all slices in 171 and
193 Å. On the contrary, the oscillation of L2 is distinguish-
able along S2-S4 in 171 Å (panels (a1-a3)), while it is clear
only along S3 in 193 Å (panel (b2)).4 Zhangetal .

The trajectories of L1 and L2 along S1-S4 are plotted with
orange and black circles in Figure 8. To precisely derive the
background trend including the contraction and expansion,
we apply the following function of t:
h(t)=−c1tanh(t−t1

where c1,t1,a1,c2,t2,a2, and dare seven free param-
eters. The ﬁrst and second terms represent contraction
(Russell et al. 2015 ) and expansion ( Zhang et al. 2022b ), re-
spectively. t1andt2denote times after the onsets of con-
traction. The curve ﬁttings are performed by using the mp-
ﬁt.pro program in SSW. The ﬁtted parameters are listed in
Table 1and the background trends are superposed with green
and blue dashed lines in Figure 8. It is clear that the trends
are smooth and the ﬁttings are satisfactory in most cases.
In Figure 8, the associated detrended trajectories of ACLs
are obtained after subtracting the background trends. InFigure 9, the top panels show the detrended trajectories
of L1 and L2 in 171 Å. It is obvious that vertical os-
cillations of the loops last for 2 −9 cycles and the am-
plitudes are≤4 Mm. Morlet wavelet transforms of the
detrended trajectories are displayed in the bottom panels
of Figure 9. The corresponding periods of oscillations
are between 3 and 12 minutes, which are listed in the
eleventh column of Table 1. The multiple periods sug-
gest possible existence of harmonics in loop oscillations
(De Moortel & Brady 2007 ;Van Doorsselaere et al. 2007 ;
Duckenﬁeld et al. 2018 ). To derive the damping times of the
vertical oscillations, the detrended trajectories are ﬁtt ed with
the function ( Nakariakov et al. 1999 ):

The top panels of Figure 10show detrended trajectories
of L1 and L2 in 193 Å. Morlet wavelet transforms of the

Figure 10. The corresponding periods of oscillations are be-
tween 5.8 and 6.5 minutes. It is noted that the oscillation
along S4 in 193 Å (Figure 8(b1)) is marginal. Hence, wavelet
transform was not carried out. Likewise, the corresponding
τdandτd/Pin 193 Å are listed in the last two columns of
Table 1. The damping times of all ACLs in 171 and 193 Å
range from 8 to 35 minutes with a median value of ∼14 min-
utes. The ratio ofτd/Prange from 0.8 to 8.5 with a median
value of∼2.0, which is close to that of horizontal oscillations
(Zhang et al. 2020 ;Dai et al. 2021 ). The average and stan-
dard deviation of all periods of ACLs are 6.7 and 2 minutes,
respectively. This average period is close to the periods of
transverse loop oscillation on 2001 April 15 ( Verwichte et al.
2004 ) and 2001 June 15 ( Aschwanden et al. 2002 ). Assum-
ing a semi-circular shape of the ACLs, the average loop
length ( L) is estimated to be ∼220 Mm, which is also equal
to the loop length on 2001 April 15 ( Verwichte et al. 2004 ).
The phase speed of vertical oscillation is calculated to be

4.DISCUSSION
To explain the contraction and vertical oscillation of the
overlying coronal loops as a result of coronal implosion,
Russell et al. (2015 ) employs a novel equation:
d2x
dt2+ω2(x−x0(t))+2ωκdx
dt=0, (3)
where x(t) denotes the displacement of the loop, x0(t) de-
notes the equilibrium position as a function of t,ωdenotes
the frequency of the undamped oscillation, and κis the damp-
ing ratio. The response of overlying loop depends on the
ratio of change-in-equilibrium time scale ( τcie) to the pe-
riod of oscillation ( τosc), i.e.,τcie/τosc. The loop impulsively
reaches a new equilibrium position with oscillation when
τcie≪τosc. In contrast, the loop collapses slowly withoutVerticaloscillationsofcoronalloops 7

lation takes place when the two parameters are comparable
(see their Fig. 4). The speed of contraction ( Vcon) is the
highest whenτcie≪τoscand lowest whenτcie≫τosc. In
other words,τcieis inversely proportional to Vcon. Conse-
quently, the vertical oscillation seems to be stealth durin g the
impulsive collapse and becomes discernible on the conditio n
of moderate collapse. Zhang et al. (2022b ) studied the con-

Equation ( 3) can interpret not only the contraction and os-
cillation of overlying coronal loops, but also the expansio n
and oscillation of ACLs. Moreover, an innovative cartoon is
proposed to illustrate the whole process (see their Fig. 12) .
In the current study, the values of Vconin 171 Å are betweenFigure 8. Trajectories of ACLs (orange circles for L1 and black

Figure 8and Table 2). The values of Vconin 193 Å are be-
tween 8 and 54 km s−1with a median value of 41 km s−1,
which are considerably lower than the value (71 km s−1) on
2022 January 20. That is to say, the values of τciein the
current event are much longer than that on 2022 January 20,
which may explain the coherent vertical oscillations durin g
both contraction and expansion phases of ACLs.
Using the multiwavelength observations from SDO /AIA,
Chandra et al. (2021 ) investigated the ﬁlament eruption and
evolutions of two sets of adjacent loop systems on 2013
March 16. The ﬁlament eruption was related to a partial
halo CME and a weak coronal wave, but was not associated
with a detectable x-ray ﬂare. Both sets of coronal loops un-
derwent in-phase contraction ﬁrst and then expand roughly
back to their original positions without kink oscillation. The
speeds of contraction vary from 2 to 10 km s−1in 171 Å and
from 3 to 11 km s−1in 193 Å (see Table 2). Therefore, the
speeds of contraction are the lowest and the value of τcieis
the longest on 2013 March 16, which might interpret the ab-
sence of oscillation during the contraction. In brief, the t hree
events are representative of three cases of coronal loop dy-8 Zhangetal .

tion followed by expansion and oscillation, coherent oscil la-

5.SUMMARY
In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the M1.6
class eruptive ﬂare occurring in AR 13078 on 2022 August
19. The ﬂare is associated with a fast CME propagating in
the southwest direction with an apparent speed of ∼926 km
s−1. Meanwhile, a shock wave is driven by the CME at the
ﬂank. The early evolution of CME is accompanied by a type
II radio burst, suggesting the shock wave is formed during th e
impulsive acceleration of CME. The eruption of CME gener-
ates an EUV wave expanding outward from the ﬂare site with
an apparent speed of ≥200 km s−1. As the EUV wave propa-
gates eastward, it encounters and interacts with the low-ly ing
ACLs, which are composed of two loops (L1 and L2). The
compression of EUV wave results in contraction, expansion,and transverse vertical oscillations of ACLs. The start tim es
of contraction are sequential from the western to eastern fo ot-
points and the contraction lasts for ∼15 minutes. The speeds
of contraction lie in the range of 13 −40 km s−1in 171 Å and
8−54 km s−1in 193 Å. A long, gradual expansion follows the
contraction at lower speeds. Concurrent vertical oscillat ions
are superposed on contraction and expansion of ACLs, which
has rarely been reported before. The oscillations last for 2 −9
cycles and the amplitudes are ≤4 Mm. The periods are be-
tween 3 to 12 minutes with an average value of 6.7 minutes.
According to the loop length and periods, the average kink
speed (∼1094 km s−1) and internal Alfv´ en speed ( ∼811 km
s−1) of the ACLs are estimated.
In the future, in-depth investigations of the interaction b e-
tween EUV waves and coronal loops are highly desirable, es-
pecially using high-resolution observations from the Extr eme
Ultraviolet Imager (EUI; Rochus et al. 2020 ) on board Solar
Orbiter (SO; M¨ uller et al. 2020 ). State-of-the-art MHD nu-
merical simulations are greatly expected to explain the loo p
dynamics ( Downs et al. 2021 ;Wang et al. 2021 ;Guo et al.
2023 ).
