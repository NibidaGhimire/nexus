Harnessing spin and orbital angular momentum is a fundamental concept in
condensed matter physics, materials science, and quantum-device applications.
In particular, the search for phenomena that generate a flow of spin angular
momentum, a spin current, has led to the development of spintronics, advancing
the understanding of angular momentum dynamics at the nanoscale. In contrast,
the generation of an orbital current, the orbital counterpart of a spin current,
remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the observation of orbital-
current generation from magnetization dynamics: orbital pumping. We show
that the orbital pumping in Ni/Ti bilayers injects an orbital current into the
Ti layer, which is detected through the inverse orbital Hall effect. The orbital
pumping is the orbital counterpart of the spin pumping, which is one of the most
versatile and powerful mechanisms for spin-current generation. Our findings
provide a promising approach for generating orbital currents, opening the door
to explore the orbital analogue of spintronics: orbitronics.
Main
Electrons carry spin and orbital angular momentum, both of which are fundamental to the
electronic and magnetic properties of materials. Over the past three decades, studies of
a flow of spin angular momentum, a spin current, have revealed its fascinating topologi-
cal, relativistic, and quantum mechanical nature, leading to the development of spintronics.
The key element of spintronics is the interplay between spin currents and magnetization in
ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic (FM/NM) bilayers1. In a FM/NM bilayer, when a spin cur-
rent is injected into the FM layer from the adjacent NM layer, the injected spin current
interacts with the magnetization through the exchange coupling in the FM layer, exerting
a torque, called a spin torque, on the magnetization2. The spin torque drives domain-wall
motion, magnetization switching, and magnetization precession, providing a way to realize
a plethora of ultralow power and fast spintronic devices, such as nonvolatile magnetic mem-
ories, nanoscale microwave sources, and neuromorphic computing devices3–5. The reciprocal
effect of the spin torque is known as the spin pumping, a phenomenon in which precessing
magnetization in the FM layer pumps a spin current into the adjacent NM layer6–8. The spin
pumping is one of the most versatile and powerful mechanisms for spin-current generation,
2leading to the discovery of a variety of spin-current phenomena, such as spin transport in in-
sulators and nonvolatile electric control of spin-charge conversion9–11. This pair of reciprocal
effects, the spin torque and the spin pumping, has played a central role in the development
of modern spintronics.
In contrast to the success in establishing the physics of spin currents, the orbital counter-
part of spin currents, orbital currents, has been largely overlooked. Recent studies, however,
have suggested the crucial role of orbital currents, a flow of orbital angular momentum, in the
dynamics of angular momentum in solids12,13. In particular, experimental and theoretical
studies have suggested the existence of the orbital counterpart of the spin torque: an orbital
torque14–23. The orbital torque emerges when an orbital current is injected into a FM layer.
In the FM layer, the injected orbital angular momentum interacts with the magnetization
through a combined action of the spin-orbit coupling and the exchange coupling in the FM
layer, exerting a torque on the magnetization, which is the orbital torque14. The Onsager’s
reciprocal relations guarantee the existence of the reciprocal effect of the orbital torque, in
which an orbital current is pumped by magnetization dynamics. This phenomenon is the
orbital counterpart of the spin pumping and can be referred to as orbital pumping. Despite
its importance, however, the orbital pumping remains unexplored; the orbital pumping is
the missing piece in the set of spin and orbital current phenomena (see Fig. 1a).
In this work, we report the observation of the orbital pumping. We show that a charge
current is generated at ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in Ni/Ti bilayers, in which the exis-
tence of the orbital torque originating from the orbital Hall effect (OHE) is well established22.
In FM/NM bilayers, the precession of the magnetization in the FM layer can generate charge
currents in the NM layer through two distinct channels: the spin pumping followed by the
inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) and the orbital pumping followed by the inverse orbital Hall
effect (IOHE). We demonstrate that the experimental characteristics of the observed current
are consistent with it being generated through the IOHE induced by the orbital pumping.
The orbital pumping can be understood as an orbital analog of the spin pumping7with
the same symmetry constraint (the physical picture is explained in Supplementary Note 1).
In a NM/FM bilayer, an orbital current driven by dynamics of the magnetization is given
by
jo=βm×dm
dt+β′dm
dt, (1)
where mdenotes the unit vector of the magnetization. Here, the orbital polarization direc-
3tion of jois represented by its vector direction, and the propagation direction of electrons is
perpendicular to the interface. However, the crucial difference between the orbital pumping
and the spin pumping is that the orbital pumping requires the spin-orbit coupling in its
microscopic mechanism24. This is because the orbital angular momentum interacts with
the magnetization only indirectly via the spin-orbit interaction14,25. Therefore, the orbital
pumping sensitively depends on how the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are correlated,
which differs from material to material24. A recent theory predicts that ferromagnetic Ni
exhibits the strongest orbital pumping among Fe, Co, and Ni24. It has been found that
Ni exhibits pronounced correlation between the spin and orbital angular momenta near the
Fermi surface20,24,25.
As schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a, the orbital pumping can be electrically detected
by the IOHE, as the spin pumping is detected by the ISHE. Here, the major difference
between the IOHE and ISHE is their dependence on the spin-orbit coupling. While the
ISHE arises from the spin-orbit coupling, the IOHE does not require it. Thus, a light metal
such as Ti can be used to detect the orbital pumping. We note that recent experiments have
revealed large OHE in Ti21,22. To detect the spin pumping, on the other hand, typically a
heavy metal such as Pt is employed for its large ISHE. This motivates us to consider the
Ti/Ni bilayers, in which gigantic orbital torque response has been observed in the previous
work22.
Charge-current generation
To detect the orbital pumping, we measured the direct-current (DC) voltage VDCgenerated
at the FMR for FM/NM bilayers with FM = Ni, Fe, or Co and NM = Ti or Pt. In Fig. 1b,
we show a schematic of the device and experimental setup (for details, see Methods). Equa-
tion (1) shows that the DC component of an orbital current generated by the orbital pumping
is proportional to the projection of m×dm/dtonto the magnetization-precession axis. This
projection is proportional to the square of the magnetization-precession amplitude, showing
that the injected orbital current is proportional to the microwave power Pinand microwave
absorption intensity P(see also Supplementary Note 2). Equation (1) also shows that the
orbital polarization direction of the DC component of the injected orbital current is directed
along the magnetization-precession axis, which is parallel to an external magnetic field in
the FM/NM bilayers at the FMR. For the measurement, we applied a radio frequency (RF)
4current IRFwith a frequency of fperpendicular to the direction across electrodes attached
to the FM/NM device and swept an in-plane external field Happlied at an angle of θfrom
the direction of the applied RF current (see Fig. 1b).
In Fig. 1c, we show magnetic field Hdependence of the microwave absorption Pand
charge current IDC=VDC/Rsignals measured for the Ni(5 nm)/Ti(10 nm) bilayer at
θ= 0, where Ris the resistance of the device between the electrodes, and the num-
bers in parentheses represent the thickness. Figure 1c shows that despite the negligible
ISHE in the Ti layer26, a clear IDCsignal appears around the FMR field HFMR. The ob-
served charge-current signal can be decomposed into symmetric and antisymmetric func-
tions with respect to HFMR:IDC=IsymW2/[(µ0H−µ0HFMR)2+W2] +Iantisym W(µ0H−
µ0HFMR)/[(µ0H−µ0HFMR)2+W2], where Wdenotes the FMR linewidth27. The spin and
orbital pumping generate the symmetric component Isymthrough the ISHE and IOHE,
respectively, because the DC component of the pumped current is proportional to the mi-
crowave absorption intensity28. Figure 1c shows that the IDCsignal in the Ni/Ti bilayer is
dominated by the symmetric component Isym, suggesting that the observed charge current
stems from the orbital pumping. Here, in the IDCsignal, the nonzero antisymmetric com-
ponent Iantisym arises from spin rectification effects, which can be induced by the anisotropic
magnetoresistance (AMR), the planar Hall effect (PHE), and the anomalous Hall effect
(AHE) in the Ni layer29,30. The asymmetric line shape in the Psignal is presumably in-
duced by eddy currents, which lead to an absorption-dispersion admixture31.
To reveal the origin of the charge current observed in the Ni/Ti bilayer, we measured the
microwave absorption Pand the charge current IDCfor Ni(5 nm) and Fe(5 nm)/Ti(10 nm)
films, as well as the Ni(5 nm)/Ti(10 nm) bilayer at various frequencies f. Figures 2a-2c
show the Hdependence of PandIDC/Pabsfor the three devices at θ= 0, where Pabsis the
microwave absorption intensity at the FMR field (see Fig. 1c). We note that the symmetric
component of IDC/Pabs,Isym/Pabs, in the Ni single-layer film is negligible compared to that
in the Ni/Ti bilayer (see Figs. 2a and 2b). This result demonstrates that the Isymsignal in
the Ni/Ti bilayer is generated in the Ti layer; spin-rectification effects and thermoelectric
effects in the Ni layer are not the source of the observed Isymsignals in the Ni/Ti bilayer.
The contribution from the charge current generated in the Ni layer is discussed in detail in
Supplementary Note 3.
An important feature of the Isymsignal is that its magnitude strongly depends on the
5choice of the FM layer. Figure 2c shows that Isym/Pabsis vanishingly small in the Fe/Ti
bilayer, despite the fact that the Isymsignal in the Ni/Ti bilayer originates from the Ti
layer. The distinct difference in the magnitude of Isym/Pabsbetween the Ni/Ti and Fe/Ti
bilayers is the key feature of the orbital pumping24. In Ni, the electronic occupation of the
dorbital shells is optimized such that the spin-orbit correlation is particularly strong near
the Fermi energy20,22,25. The strong spin-orbit correlation near the Fermi energy results
in the strong coupling between the magnetization and orbital current in Ni, which has
been confirmed by the orbital-torque studies19,20,22,23. This implies a large orbital pumping
efficiency βin the Ni/Ti bilayer (see Eq. (1)), suggesting that the orbital pumping in the
Ni/Ti bilayer can inject a large orbital current into the Ti bilayer. In contrast, we expect
that the orbital pumping in the Fe/Ti bilayer is inefficient. The reason for this is that the
spin-orbit correlation near the Fermi energy in Fe is much smaller than that in Ni, as the
hotspots for the spin-orbit correlation are located about 1 eV below the Fermi energy in
Fe25. The inefficient coupling between the magnetization and orbital current in Fe has been
demonstrated in previous reports; while the current-induced torques in Ni-based structures
are dominated by the orbital torques, the spin torques provide the dominant contribution in
Fe-based structures20,22. This indicates that the distinct difference in the observed charge-
current signals between the Ni/Ti and Fe/Ti bilayers can be primarily attributed to the large
difference in the orbital pumping efficiency βdue to the different strengths of the spin-orbit
correlation near the Fermi energy between Ni and Fe (see also Supplementary Note 1).
We have confirmed that the fdependence of Isym/Pabsof the Ni/Ti bilayer is consistent
with the model of the spin and orbital pumping (see Supplementary Note 4). Here, the
negligible Isym/Pabsin the Fe/Ti bilayer indicates that the charge current due to the ISHE
is negligible in the FM/Ti bilayers. This result is consistent with the vanishingly small spin
Hall angle of Ti26,θSH=−3.6×10−4, which is three orders of magnitude smaller than that
of Pt. The negligible Isym/Pabsin the Fe/Ti bilayer also supports that sample heating is
irrelevant to the charge-current signals observed in the Ni/Ti bilayer because thermoelectric
effects are comparable between Fe and Ni32.
Characterization of charge current
To obtain further evidence for the IOHE induced by the orbital pumping, we measured
IDCfor the Ni/Ti bilayer by varying the microwave power Pinand magnetic field angle θ.
6In Fig. 3a, we show the IDCspectra for the Ni/Ti bilayer measured at different Pinwith
applying the magnetic field at θ= 0 and θ= 180◦. By fitting the spectra using the sum of
the symmetric and antisymmetric functions, we obtain the Pindependence of Isym, as shown
in Fig. 3b. This result indicates that Isymis proportional to Pin, which is consistent with
the scenario of the DC orbital pumping.
Figures 3a and 3b demonstrate that the sign of Isymis reversed by reversing the magnetic
field direction. This result is also consistent with the prediction of the orbital pumping
because the DC component of the orbital polarization direction is reversed by reversing the
magnetic field direction. We further studied the magnetic field angle θdependence of the
charge-current generation, as shown in Fig. 3c. By fitting the measured spectra, we plot Isym
with respect to θfor the Ni/Ti bilayer in Fig. 4a. As shown in Fig. 4a, the θdependence of
Isymis well fitted by29,30,33,34

AMRarise from the AMR
due to in-plane and out-of-plane microwave magnetic fields, respectively. This result shows
that the spin rectification signal in this system is dominated by the AMR because the
PHE and AHE contributions show different angular dependences; the PHE contributions
are proportional to cos 2 θcosθand cos 2 θfor in-plane and out-of-plane microwave magnetic
fields, respectively, and the AHE contribution varies as cos θfor an in-plane microwave
magnetic field and is constant for an out-of-plane microwave magnetic field30,34. Here, Eq. (2)
indicates that Isymatθ= 0 corresponds to Ipump. The fitting result in Fig. 4a confirms that
theIsymcomponent of the charge-current signal in the Ni/Ti bilayer at θ= 0 varies as cos3θ,
supporting that the charge-current signals shown in Fig. 2a arise from the orbital pumping.
We also confirmed that the Ipump component is negligible in the Ni single-layer and the
Fe/Ti bilayer, as shown in Figs. 4b and 4c. These results support that the generation of
the charge current requires the IOHE of the Ti layer and the strong spin-orbit correlation
of the Ni layer. Here, we note that Ipump is also observed in a Co/Ti bilayer (see Figs. 4d
and 4e). The measured value of Ipump/Pabsfor the Co/Ti bilayer is smaller than that of
the Ni/Ti bilayer but is larger than that of the Fe/Ti bilayer. This result is consistent with
the model of the orbital pumping because the orbital response of Co is weaker than that
of Ni but is stronger than that of Fe20. For the Ni/Ti bilayer, we have further checked the
7validity of the experiment by performing the pumping experiment in which the out-of-plane
microwave magnetic field is dominant (see Supplementary Note 5). The magnetic damping
is also investigated for the Ni/Ti bilayer (see Supplementary Note 6).
As a reference, we measured IDCfor a Fe(5 nm)/Pt(10 nm) bilayer, as shown in Figs. 4f
and 4g. This result shows that the sign of Ipump in the Ni/Ti bilayer is the same as that in
the Fe/Pt bilayer. In the Fe/Pt bilayer, the Ipump signal is dominated by the ISHE due to
the spin pumping because of the weak spin-orbit correlation in the Fe layer and the strong
ISHE in the Pt layer. In the scenario of the spin pumping, the spin polarization direction is
defined by the magnetization direction and is independent of the choice of the FM layer35.
In contrast, the orbital polarization direction of the orbital current generated by the orbital
pumping can depend on the sign of the spin-orbit correlation in the FM layer. In Ni, the
spin-orbit correlation is positive, indicating that the direction of the orbital polarization of
the orbital current is the same as that of the spin polarization of the spin current generated
by the spin pumping14. Thus, the same sign of Ipump between the Ni/Ti and Fe/Pt bilayers
indicates that the sign of the orbital Hall angle in the Ti layer is the same as that of the
spin Hall angle in the Pt layer. This result is consistent with the theoretical prediction that
the signs of the orbital Hall conductivity in Ti and the spin Hall conductivity in Pt are both
positive36, supporting that the observed signal in the Ni/Ti bilayer arises from the IOHE.
We also note that the sign of the orbital torque in the Ni/Ti bilayer is the same as that of
the spin torque produced by the SHE in Pt22.
To characterize the strength of the charge-current generation through the orbital pumping
and IOHE, we define the conversion efficiency from the absorbed microwave power Pabsto
the generated charge current Ipump as

the conductivity of the NM layer. Here, the conversion efficiency κis defined such that it

the ISHE induced by the spin pumping, where g↑↓
effis the effective spin mixing conductance,
σSHEis the spin Hall conductivity, and λsis the spin diffusion length. In analogy to the spin
8pumping, we expect that the charge current generated by the orbital pumping is determined
by the orbital pumping efficiency β, the orbital Hall conductivity σOHE, and the orbital
diffusion length λo, and therefore we use κdefined in Eq. (3) to characterize the strength of
the orbital pumping and IOHE.
In Fig. 5, we show Ti-layer thickness tTidependence of κ, determined by measuring
theθdependence of IDC, for the Ni(5 nm)/Ti( tTi) bilayers. The charge-current genera-
tion efficiency κof the Ni/Ti bilayer is about an order of magnitude smaller than κ=
24×1015Ω−1m−2of the Fe(5 nm)/Pt(10 nm) bilayer, which is roughly consistent with the
difference between the generation efficiencies of the orbital and spin torques in these sys-
tems22. Figure 5 shows that κof the Ni/Ti bilayer increases with tTi. By fitting the tTi
dependence of κfor the Ni/Ti bilayer with a function proportional to tanh( tTi/2λTi), we
obtain the characteristic length of the charge-current generation to be λTi= 4.6 nm. This
characteristic length is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the orbital-torque gen-
eration21,22, implying that the length scale associated with the orbital transport triggered
by the orbital pumping is different from that triggered by the OHE. Similar arguments
have been made for spin transport; a potential difference in the length scales of diffusive
spin currents and intrinsically generated spin Hall currents has been suggested, but their
relationship remains unclear37.
It is also worth noting the potential role of the inverse orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect in
the charge-current generation induced by the orbital pumping. Recently, ultrafast dynamics
of orbital transport have been studied using time-domain THz emission spectroscopy38.
In the experiment, the orbital transport is triggered by exciting a SiO 2/W/Ni film with
femtosecond laser pulses. In the SiO 2/W/Ni film, the current-induced orbital torque, or
the charge-to-orbital conversion, has been observed to be dominated by the OHE in the
W layer22. However, the THz emission dynamics in the SiO 2/W/Ni film indicates that the
orbital-to-charge conversion is dominated by the inverse orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect at
the SiO 2/W interface. This finding suggests that the direct and inverse orbital responses
could be dominated by the different mechanisms. The relatively short characteristic length
observed for the orbital pumping suggests the possibility that the inverse orbital Rashba-
Edelstein effect contributes to the charge-current generation. Understanding the length
scales associated with orbital transport remains a challenge for future studies.
9Conclusions and outlook
In conclusion, we have presented experimental evidence for the orbital pumping, where the
precession of magnetization results in the emission of an orbital current into an adjacent
layer. We have shown that the orbital current generated by the orbital pumping in the Ni/Ti
bilayer is converted into a charge current through the IOHE in the Ti layer without using
spin-orbit coupling. Although a recent study on Y 3Fe5O12/Pt/CuO xstructures suggested
the involvement of the inverse orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect in the generation of a charge
current, the underlying mechanism is the spin pumping into the Pt layer and subsequent
spin-to-orbital conversion by spin-orbit coupling in the Pt layer39. This mechanism is distinct
from the emission of orbital currents by the orbital pumping, observed in the present work.
The spin pumping is one of the most versatile and powerful mechanisms for spin-current
generation, which enables spin injection into a wide variety of systems ranging from metals
and semiconductors to magnetic insulators, organic materials, superconductors, and topolog-
ical insulators9,10,40–43. This exceptional ability of the spin pumping has played an important
role in the discovery of a variety of fundamental phenomena in spintronics. We anticipate
that the orbital pumping—the orbital counterpart of the spin pumping—provides a powerful
way to explore the physics of orbital currents and orbital dynamics. Our results provide a
fundamental piece of information for deeper understanding of the angular momentum dy-
namics in solids at the nanoscale, which will stimulate further experimental and theoretical
studies.

ofIDCfor each device. The solid curve in red is the fitting result using a function proportional to
tanh( tTi/2λTi).
15Methods
Device fabrication. The FM(5 nm)/NM( tNM) bilayers (FM = Ni, Fe or Co, NM =
Ti or Pt) were deposited on thermally oxidized Si substrates using radio frequency (RF)
magnetron sputtering under a 6N-purity-Ar atmosphere at room temperature. The working
pressure was 0.4 Pa. The thicknesses of the SiO 2and Si layers are 100 nm and 625 µm,
respectively. For the sputtering of the FM/Ti bilayers, the base pressure was better than
5×10−7Pa, which was achieved by reducing the residual hydrogen and oxygen contents
through a sputtering process using a Ti target (at least 0.4 Pa, 5 min, 120 W). The FM/Pt
bilayers were sputtered with a base pressure better than 1 .0×10−5Pa. To vary the Ti-layer
thickness of the Ni/Ti bilayer on the same substrate, a wedged Ti film was fabricated by
using a linear shutter. All samples were capped by 4-nm-thick-SiO 2to prevent oxidation. For
the pumping measurement, the films were fabricated into Hall cross structures with a width
ofw= 8µm utilizing the conventional photolithography with negative resist followed by
the Ar-ion milling and lift-off technique. The device was placed under a coplanar waveguide
(CPW) consisting of Ti(3 nm)/Au(400 nm) deposited by RF magnetron sputtering. A
SiO 2(170 nm) insulating layer was deposited by RF magnetron sputtering between the device
and the CPW.
Microwave absorption and voltage measurements. For the FM/NM bilayers, we mea-
sured DC electromotive force VDCusing a nanovoltmeter (2182A, Keithley) with applying
an RF current to the CPW and in-plane magnetic field H. The in-plane magnetic field H
was applied at an angle of θfrom the direction of the applied RF current (see Fig. 1b). The
microwave absorption intensity Pwas determined by measuring S11using a vector network
analyzer (VNA) (N5222A, Keysight)45, where P= (∆|S11|2/|S0
11|)Pin. Here, |S0
11|represents
the reflection loss between the CPW and the port of the VNA without the FMR, and ∆ |S11|2
is the change ratio of the reflected microwave power at the FMR (see Supplementary Note
2).
