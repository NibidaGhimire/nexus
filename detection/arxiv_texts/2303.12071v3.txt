Abstract
Motion forecasting is a key module in an autonomous
driving system. Due to the heterogeneous nature of multi-
sourced input, multimodality in agent behavior, and low la-
tency required by onboard deployment, this task is notori-
ously challenging. To cope with these difficulties, this paper
proposes a novel agent-centric model with anchor-informed
proposals for efficient multimodal motion prediction. We
design a modality-agnostic strategy to concisely encode the
complex input in a unified manner. We generate diverse
proposals, fused with anchors bearing goal-oriented scene
context, to induce multimodal prediction that covers a wide
range of future trajectories. Our network architecture is
highly uniform and succinct, leading to an efficient model
amenable for real-world driving deployment. Experiments
reveal that our agent-centric network compares favorably
with the state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy,
while achieving scene-centric level inference latency.
1. Introduction
Predicting the future behaviors of various road partici-
pants is an essential task for autonomous driving systems
to be able to safely and comfortably operate in dynamic
driving environments. However, motion forecasting is ex-
tremely challenging in the sense that (i) the input consists of
interrelated modalities from multiple sources; (ii) the output
is inherently stochastic and multimodal; and (iii) the whole
prediction pipeline must fulfill tight run time requirements
with a limited computation budget.
A motion forecasting model typically collects the com-
prehensive information from perception signals and high-
definition (HD) maps, such as traffic light states, motion
history of agents, and the road graph [11, 13, 14, 23]. Such
a collection of information is a heterogeneous mix of static
and dynamic, as well as discrete and continuous elements.
Moreover, there exist complex semantic relations between
these components, including agent-to-agent, agent-to-road,

and road-to-road interactions. Previous methods in the field
usually model this diverse set of input via an equally intri-
cate system with modality-specific designs. LaneGCN [9]
adopts four sub-networks to separately process the inter-
actions of agent-to-agent, agent-to-road, road-to-agent and
road-to-road. MultiPath++ is developed in [21] to employ
multi-context gating to first capture the interactions between
a target agent and other agents, and then fuse them with the
map in a hierarchical manner.
Due to the unknown intent of an agent, motion predic-
tion output is highly multimodal by nature. It is often im-
possible to assert with full certainty whether a vehicle will
go straight or turn right as it approaches an intersection.
The motion prediction model is therefore required to accu-
rately model the underlying probability distribution of fu-
ture behaviors. Recently, there have been various efforts
on improving output multimodality. TNT [30] introduces
three stages including goal (endpoint of a predicted trajec-
tory) prediction, goal-conditioned motion estimation, and
trajectory scoring. DenseTNT is proposed in [7] to improve
upon the former by predicting from dense goal candidates
1arXiv:2303.12071v3  [cs.CV]  28 Jun 2023and conducting an iterative offline optimization algorithm to
generate multi-future pseudo labels. A region based train-
ing strategy is developed in mmTransformer [12] to manu-
ally partition a scene into subregions to enforce predictions
to fall into different regions to promote multimodality.
In a practical autonomous driving system, the whole pre-
diction pipeline typically operates at a frequency of 10Hz,
including (i) feature extraction from upstream modules, (ii)
network inference, and (iii) post-processing. Therefore, a
motion forecasting network is required to meet the strict
inference latency constraint to be useful in the real-world
setting. While the recent agent-centric paradigm [15, 21] is
trending and has made remarkable progress on improving
accuracy, its latency is dramatically increased compared to
its scene-centric counterpart [5, 12], as shown in Figure 1.
This is because agent-centric models compute scene repre-
sentations with respect to each agent separately, meaning
the amount of features to process is dozens of times larger
than that with scene-centric models. This substantially in-
creases the latency of the whole prediction pipeline and is
computationally prohibitive for onboard deployment.
In light of these observations, we present ProphNet : an
efficient agent-centric motion forecasting model that fuses
heterogeneous input in a unified manner and enhances mul-
timodal output via a design of anchor-informed proposals.
In contrast to the existing complex modality-specific pro-
cessing [9, 21], we develop a modality-agnostic architec-
ture that combines the features of agent history, agent rela-
tion and road graph as the agent-centric scene representa-
tion (AcSR), which directly feeds to a unified self-attention
encoder [22]. In this way, we motivate the self-attention
network to learn the complex interactions with minimum in-
ductive bias. Additionally, we propose the anchor-informed
proposals (AiP) in an end-to-end learning fashion to induce
output multimodality. In our approach, proposals are the
future trajectory embeddings conjectured exclusively from
agent history, and anchors refer to the goal embeddings
learned from AcSR. In such a manner, the network learns
to first generate proposals to maximize diversity without
environmental restrictions, and then select and refine after
absorbing anchors that carry rich goal-oriented contextual
information. Based on random combinations of AiP, we
further introduce the hydra prediction heads to encourage
the network to learn complementary information and mean-
while perform ensembling readily.
As illustrated in Figure 2, this design formulates a suc-
cinct network with high efficiency in terms of both archi-
tecture and inference. Instead of employing a self-attention
encoder for each input modality [9,12], the self-attention on
AcSR unifies the learning of intra- and inter-modality inter-
actions in a single compact space, which allows the network
to assign associations within and across input modalities
with maximum flexibility. Our model also considerably re-duces inference latency and performs prediction with a peak
latency as low as 28ms. In addition, rather than heuristically
predefining or selecting goals to strengthen output multi-
modality [1, 7, 30], AiP is learned end-to-end to infuse goal
based anchors to proposals that are deliberately produced
with diverse multimodality. In the end, together with the
hydra prediction heads, our network is capable of generat-
ing future trajectories with rich variety.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows. First,
we develop an input-source-agnostic strategy based on
AcSR to model heterogeneous input and simplify network
architecture, making the model amenable for real-world
driving deployment. Second, we propose a novel frame-
work that couples proposal and anchor learning end-to-end
through AiP to promote output multimodality. Third, we in-
troduce hydra prediction heads to learn complementary pre-
diction and explore ensembling. Fourth, we show that our
network, as an agent-centric model, achieves state-of-the-
art accuracy on the popular benchmarks while maintaining
scene-centric level low inference latency.
2. Related Work
Representation Paradigms. Motion forecasting methods
can be roughly categorized into two types according to the
spatial feature representation: rasterized [1,18,20] and vec-
torized [5,7,27]. Rasterized methods render agent states and
HD maps as color-coded attributes, and use image-oriented
networks (e.g., CNN) to encode scene context. Vectorized
methods represent agent dynamics and map elements in
their vectorized form. Combined with the attention mech-
anism, vectorized approaches have dominated the leading
results recently. On the other hand, regarding the reference
points for feature encoding, methods fall into two groups:
scene-centric [5, 16] and agent-centric [15, 30]. In the for-
mer, scene representation is extracted once for all agents in
a shared coordinate frame, while the latter repeatedly builds
a normalized coordinate frame for each agent and extracts
corresponding scene features. As a result, the scene-centric
models are generally more computationally efficient, and
the agent-centric models deliver better accuracy.
Modeling Heterogeneous Input. Modeling the complex
interactions among diverse types of input is vital for ef-
fectively capturing the scene context. LaneGCN [9] uses
graph convolution to improve road graph representation,
and proposes four input-specific fusion modules for inter-
action modeling. Based on LaneGCN, BANet [29] further
incorporates more road graph elements and interaction fu-
sion blocks, while PAGA [4] augments map encoding with
attention between non-adjacent map elements. SceneTrans-
former [16] develops multi-axis attention to model spatial
and temporal information, where agent-to-agent and agent-
to-road interactions are learned in separate modules. Way-
former [15] also adopts multi-axis attention and studies fus-
2Figure 2. A schematic overview of ProphNet. We uniformly encode the heterogeneous input by gMLP, and combine the compact encoding
features to form a unified representation space AcSR. We generate proposals through cross-attention between learnable queries and full
history encoding. Anchors are learned based on self-attention of AcSR. We introduce AiP by integrating proposals and anchors, and
randomly select subsets from AiP to feed into hydra prediction heads to output the final prediction. We use the solid and dashed boxes to
indicate operators and operands in the network, respectively.
ing multi-sourced input at different stages. Most previous
works focus on explicitly processing and combining indi-
vidual input sources to better model their interactions, thus
inevitably resulting in increased model complexity.
Enhancing Multimodal Output. Extensive research ef-
forts have been made in multimodal prediction. Planning
based methods [19] apply basic planning rules to generate
plenty of feasible trajectories following the road graph and
kinematic constraints as trajectory candidates. In [12] mm-
Transformer uses a region based training scheme placing
predictions in manually defined regions to enrich the output.
MultiPath [1] clusters trajectories from training data as pre-
diction anchors to prevent mode collapse. MultiPath++ [21]
learns a fixed set of hidden anchor embeddings to capture
different modalities. TNT [30] and DenseTNT [7] rely on
sampling sparse and dense goal candidates to achieve good
coverage. We aim to induce multimodality through the pro-
posed anchor-informed proposals that can be learned fully
end-to-end and is capable of adapting to specific input.
3. Method
Figure 2 illustrates the overall architecture of ProphNet,
which involves encoding heterogeneous input into an agent-
centric scene representation, end-to-end generation of pro-
posals and anchors, coupling them to form anchor-informed
proposals, as well as hydra prediction heads to produce mul-
timodal and complementary trajectories.
3.1. Input Representation
ProphNet performs motion forecasting based on multi-
sourced input, including the motion history of target agent,
other agents in the surroundings, and road graph. Represen-
tations of different input are detailed as follows.Agent History. It is a state sequence consisting of position,
velocity and heading of the target agent at each observation
step, i.e., Ihist= [(xt, yt, vx
t, vy
t,sinθt,cosθt)t=−T+1:0].
An agent-centric coordinate frame is defined by aligning
the origin with the last observed position of a target agent
and the x+ axis with its last observed heading, such that
the target agent is located at the origin and heading to the
east at the current time t= 0. The historical states of the
target agent are then transformed to this coordinate frame.
We repeat this coordinate frame normalization for all target
agents to be predicted in a scene.
Agent Relation. This describes the relative states of other
agents with respect to a target agent. Again, the historical
states of other agents are transformed to the agent-centric
coordinate frame of the target agent. We take into account
the neighboring agents within a certain range (related to pre-
diction horizon). Assuming Bagents are considered, the
agent relation is Irela={(Ii
rela)i=1:B}, where Ii
rela, similar
toIhist, is a sequence of position, velocity and heading of
thei-th neighboring agent relative to the target agent.
Road Graph. This defines the map area where the target
agent may reach in the prediction horizon. Similarly, the
map elements are transformed to the agent-centric coordi-
nate frame. We exploit lane centerlines, lane boundaries and
traffic controls (e.g., turns and stop signs) to represent the
road graph, and approximate each lane centerline or lane
boundary by a polyline, which is an ordered set of con-
nected line segments with equal length. A road graph with
Lpolylines is represented by Iroad={(Ii
road)i=1:L}, where
Ii
roadis the i-th polyline. Let (a, b)be the endpoints of a
segment, αbe the heading angle, and cbe the closest point
on the segment to the origin. We represent a line segment
by[(a−b)/∥a−b∥2,∥c∥2, c/∥c∥2,∥a−c∥2, α].
33.2. Agent-Centric Scene Representation (AcSR)
We refer to the collection of representation encoding of
the heterogeneous input as AcSR. It provides a unified foun-
dation for learning interactions across all input sources. We
employ multilayer perceptron with gating (gMLP) [10], a
simple yet effective method to model sequential data, to per-
form uniform encoding on various input sources.
Encoding Agent History. We adopt a gMLP Ghistto
encode the historical states of a target agent as Fhist=
[f−T+1, ..., f 0] =Ghist(Ihist), where Fhist∈RT×DFis a
temporally ordered sequence of encoded features. We de-
fineFhistas the full history encoding, and ˚Fhist=f0as the
compact history encoding that only contains the feature at
the current time step t= 0.Fhistcan be adopted as a mem-
ory to generate diverse proposals as it captures the complete
spatio-temporal cues, while ˚Fhistcan be thought of as a com-
pact representation to constitute the set of AcSR.
Encoding Agent Relation. We use another gMLP Grelato
encode the relative states of neighboring agents with respect
to a target agent as Frela={(Fi
rela)i=1:B}=Grela(Irela),
where Fi
rela∈RT×DFis a temporally ordered sequence of
encoded features of the i-th neighboring agent. All neigh-
boring agents of a target agent share the same gMLP Grela.
Similarly, ˚Frela={(˚Fi
rela)i=1:B}is used to form the com-
pact agent relation encoding for AcSR.
Encoding Road Graph. We utilize a third gMLP Groadto
encode the polylines in the road graph around a target agent
asFroad={(Fi
road)i=1:L}=Groad(Iroad), where Fi
road∈
RT×DFis an ordered sequence of encoded segments of the
i-th polyline. All polylines in the road graph share the same
gMLP Groad. We also collect the compact polyline encoding
of a road graph to compose ˚Froad={(˚Fi
road)i=1:L}as the
local map representation in AcSR.
We combine the compact encoded features from the
three aforementioned input sources to construct the AcSR,
i.e.,S={˚Fhist,˚Frela,˚Froad}. AcSR provides a single unified
feature space for the complex interaction learning, leading
to a succinct network architecture. Furthermore, the differ-
ent input representations are uniformly encoded by gMLP,
which is beneficial for reducing the gap between heteroge-
neous information and enables the following attention oper-
ations to better learn the interactions within the same source
and across different sources alike.
3.3. Proposal Generation
To enhance the output multimodality, our network is
designed to first learn to generate proposals merely from
the motion history of a target agent. This maximizes the
diversity of future trajectory candidates by waiving the
constraints from the particular driving scenarios. We set
the number of generated proposals to K, which is suffi-
ciently larger than the required number of output modal-
ityM. A set of Klearnable proposal queries Qpropis ap-plied to attend to the full history encoding Fhistthrough
cross-attention to produce the set of proposals Eprop=
{(Ei
prop)i=1:K} ∈RK×DE, as demonstrated in Figure 2. It
can be verified that, for the proposal generation, using ˚Fhist
results in inferior performance than Fhist, which retains the
full historical spatial and temporal information of the target
agent (Section 4.6). To further encourage the diversity of
proposals, Qpropvectors are initialized orthogonally.
3.4. Anchor Learning
Anchors are learned end-to-end in the network to convey
goal-oriented environmental information, while preserving
diversity. We set the number of anchors to K, same as the
number of proposals, so that each anchor corresponds to
one proposal. We utilize self-attention on AcSR to let the
heterogeneous elements in Sattend to each other and learn
related interactions with maximum flexibility. Assuming
the output of self-attention is {(Ri)i=1:1+ B+L}, the target
agent representation R1has fused the input context. Our
network is then supervised to learn to predict Ktrajectory
endpoints based on R1. And the predicted endpoint that is
closest to the ground truth is chosen as the correct one. A
smooth ℓ1loss is optimized to minimize the distance be-
tween ground truth and correct prediction.
Our model does not directly adopt the predicted end-
points, but make use of their embeddings (i.e., the pre-
output features) as the anchors Eanch={(Ei
anch)i=1:K} ∈
RK×DE, which are utilized to inject the goal-oriented scene
context to the generated proposals. This is a new genre
of anchors compared to those used in previous works. In
TNT [30], anchors are uniformly sampled from the map us-
ing hand-crafted rules. In MultiPath [1], anchors are a set
of pre-defined trajectories clustered from training data. In
MultiPath++ [21], anchors are learnable model parameters
that are fixed after training and independent of input. As a
contrast, we propose to exploit the anchor embeddings to
facilitate trajectory learning. Compared to TNT and Multi-
Path, our anchors are obtained more adaptively and conve-
niently via end-to-end learning. Compared to MultiPath++,
our anchors correspond to individual samples, thus carrying
concrete sample-specific information.
3.5. Anchor-Informed Proposals (AiP)
As mentioned above, proposals can be viewed as uncon-
strained future trajectories inferred solely from agent his-
tory, and anchors convey goal based contextual informa-
tion. Here we introduce AiP to enable the network for fur-
ther selection and refinement, while achieving diverse out-
put multimodality. One way to fuse proposals and anchors
is through attention to use proposals to query anchors. How-
ever, we find this results in a collapse of multimodality to
some extent. Instead, we directly sum proposals and an-
chors together to generate AiP, which is found to be simple
4yet effective to accomplish the fusion in our experiments:
EAiP=Eprop+Eanch, (1)
where EAiP∈RK×DEis provided to the following hydra
prediction heads to output the final predicted trajectories.
3.6. Hydra Prediction Heads
As discussed in Section 3.3, we intentionally generate
more proposals than the required number of output modal-
ity (i.e., K > M ). In practice, we set K= 2M, and ran-
domly select Membeddings from EAiPas a subset. This
random selection is repeated Ntimes, and thus Ndiffer-
ent subsets can be obtained. Accordingly, we construct N
heads as the hydra prediction heads, each of which takes
as input one subset and produces multimodal future trajec-
tories. With the hydra heads and associated subsets that
are randomly selected, the output modality can be further
enhanced. In addition, this design also paves the way for
ensembling by encouraging the hydra heads to learn com-
plementary prediction. Our single network obtains a group
ofN×Mtrajectories via ensembling the predicted results
from the hydra prediction heads. We then simply employ
non-maximum suppression to merge them into the final pre-
diction output with Mmultimodal trajectories.
We parameterize the distribution of each predicted tra-
jectory as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM):
p(τ) =MX
i=1piHY
t=1N(τt−µi
t,Σi
t), (2)
where τis a trajectory in the prediction horizon H,piis
the likelihood of the i-th mode, τt∈R2is the trajectory
point at time step twith predicted mean µi
t∈R2and co-
variance Σi
t∈R2×2. For network training, we maximize
the likelihood of ground truth under the predicted trajectory
distribution. We apply hard labeling to assign the trajectory
with the smallest endpoint distance to ground truth as pos-
itive. And only the errors between positive trajectories and
ground truth are considered in the regression loss.
4. Experiments
In this section, we first describe our experimental setup
including datasets, evaluation metrics and implementation
details. A variety of ablation studies are conducted to un-
derstand the contribution of each individual design in our
network. We report extensive comparisons with the state-
of-the-art methods on two popular benchmarks.
4.1. Datasets and Metrics
We evaluate our approach on two large-scale motion
forecasting datasets: Argoverse-1 [2] and Argoverse-2 [25].

selected from intersections or dense traffic. Each sequence
consists of 2 seconds of history and 3 seconds of future,
sampled at 10Hz. Following the official split, the training,
validation and test sets have 205,942, 39,472 and 78,143
sequences respectively. Argoverse-2 upgrades the first ver-
sion on scenario complexity, prediction horizon and agent
types. It contains 250K sequences mined for challenging
scenes with rich geographic diversity. This new dataset ex-
tends the prediction horizon to 6 seconds, and covers 5 types
of agents including vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, motor-
cyclists and buses. There are 200,000, 25,000 and 25,000
sequences in training, validation and test sets.
We adopt the official evaluation metrics defined by the
two benchmarks: minADE, minFDE, brier-minFDE, and
MR. minADE (average displacement error) is the minimum
of the time-average distance between predicted trajectories
and the ground truth trajectory, over Mprediction modes.
minFDE (final displacement error) is the minimum distance
between Mpredicted endpoints and the ground truth end-
point. brier-minFDE additionally takes the prediction prob-
ability into account. MR (miss rate) is the fraction of scenes
where none of Mpredicted endpoints are within a certain
distance to ground truth.
4.2. Implementation Details
We implement ProphNet in PyTorch [17] and train on 16
NVIDIA V100 GPUs with a batch size of 64. All gMLPs
including Ghist,GrelaandGroadhave the same hidden layer
dimension 256. For all attention layers, the multi-head at-
tention is configured to 4 heads, and the dimension of each
head is 64. We employ one cross-attention layer for gener-
ating Epropand three self-attention layers for Eanch. In all
experiments, the numbers of output modality, AiP and hy-
dra prediction heads are set as M= 6,K= 12 andN= 3,
respectively. We use Adam [8] to train the model for 60
epochs, and set the initial learning rate to 2×10−4and de-
cay the learning rate to 2×10−5after 50 epochs. We keep
the same setting for both datasets.

4.3. Results on Argoverse-1
We start from the comparison of ProphNet and the lead-
ing algorithms on the validation set of Argoverse-1. Here
we do not use ensembling for a fair comparison against the
methods without such a design. So we disable the hydra
prediction heads and employ the single-head version, i.e.,
ProphNet-S. As demonstrated in Table 1, ProphNet-S out-
performs other methods by a large margin. We attribute our
superior result of minFDE to the proposed AiP, which fuses
diversified proposals with goal-oriented anchors. And the
anchor learning is explicitly trained to estimate the feasible
goals, which is reflected in the more accurate endpoint pre-
diction. This comparison clearly shows the advantage of the
overall design of our approach.
We then evaluate ProphNet on the test set of Argoverse-
1. We use dropout augmentation on agent relation and road
graph, where 10% elements are randomly dropped. We
compare with the results of published methods in Table 2.
Compared to the leading scene-centric methods, ProphNet
demonstrates strong advantage over all evaluation metrics.
As for the comparison with most recent agent-centric meth-
ods, MultiPath++ [21] employs 5 heads and each produces
64 trajectories, while ProphNet uses 3 heads and each with
6 output trajectories. Wayformer [15] trains 15 models for
ensembling. In contrast, our prediction result is generated
by a single model. It is observed that ProphNet significantly
outperforms MultiPath++, and overall performs better thanWayformer. In addition to improving the prediction accu-
racy, ProphNet is computationally efficient. See the details
of latency comparison and analysis in Section 4.5.
4.4. Results on Argoverse-2
We also evaluate ProphNet on the test set of the latest
benchmark Argoverse-2. We use the same configuration as
that of Argoverse-1. Compared to the results of published
methods, ProphNet achieves superior performance, in par-
ticular over TENET [24], which is the winner of the motion
forecasting challenge on Argoverse-2 in 2022.
4.5. Latency Analysis
In addition to prediction accuracy, we take a closer look
into inference latency, which is an equally important mea-
surement for practical onboard deployment. We compare
the inference latency of ProphNet with the state-of-the-art
methods in Table 4. We report the inference latency on a
single NVIDIA V100 GPU and set the number of agents
to 64, a reasonable amount of neighboring agents in prac-
tice. For the scene-centric models, we first compute the av-
erage latency per agent. In general, the scene-centric mod-
els run considerably faster than most agent-centric mod-
els, often by an order of magnitude. In the contrary, as
an agent-centric model, ProphNet achieves the inference
latency around 28ms, significantly speeding up run time
to the scene-centric level. We attribute our efficient in-
ference to the uniform and succint model deisgn, as well

as ruling out the computationally heavy operations such
as multi-axis [15, 16] and autoregressive sequential predic-
tion [16, 24]. It is also observed that the hydra prediction
heads in our approach only increase the latency slightly,
from 27.4ms to 28.0ms.
4.6. Ablation Study
Next we conduct various ablation experiments to under-
stand the contribution of each individual component in our
design. As shown in Table 5, model (a) makes prediction
using ˚Fhist, and model (b) using Eprop. Since Epropare gen-
erated based on Fhistthat encodes the full historical states of
a target agent, model (b) performs better than model (a). In
model (c), the hierarchical encoding first applies ˚Fhistto at-
tend to ˚Frela, and then attend to ˚Froad. For model (d), the fea-
ture representation of a target agent in AcSR is directly used
for prediction. Comparing models (c-d), we can see the
advantage of a unified feature space for learning complex
interactions over the modality-specific processing. By inte-
grating Eanchinto model (d), model (e) improves the result,
in particular for minFDE, suggesting the merit of learned
anchors for endpoint prediction. In comparison to model (f)
using a single prediction head, the full model (g) with hydra
prediction heads gains further improvement.Model minADE 1minFDE 1

ated proposals directly and (b) by the anchor-informed proposals.
4.7. Qualitative Results
Queries. In Section 3.3, we introduce proposal queries that
are orthogonally initialized for proposal generation to en-
hance output multimodality. As the queries are trainable,
we investigate to what extent the learned queries can retain
the orthogonality after training. As shown in Figure 3, the
initial queries are orthogonal, so their off-diagonal similar-
ities are zero. After training, we find the similarities of the
off-diagonal elements are still close to zero. This indicates
that our model well maintains the diversity to induce pro-
posals, showing no signs of mode collapse at this level.
Proposals. As illustrated in Figure 4(a), the trajectories
predicted directly from proposals fit well to the agent his-
tory from the perspective of kinematics, though they are
freely diverse or even off-road. This is because in our de-
sign the proposals are merely generated based on the agent
dynamics, without the contextual information such as agent
interactions and map constraints. It is found that the pro-
posals generated in this way can be fairly diversified, cater-

but are visualized here for better understanding of the learned anchors. The three examples also clearly demonstrate the diverse output

ing to our purpose for rich coverage of potential motions
at the early stage. When absorbing the goal-oriented scene
context from anchors, the anchor-informed proposals pro-
duce accurate and multimodal future trajectories, as shown
in Figure 4(b). The difference between (a-b) in this figure
vividly presents the validity of the two components (i.e.,
proposals and anchors) in ProphNet.
Anchors. We make use of the supervision of endpoint es-
timation to guide the learning of anchors. Here we demon-
strate the endpoints predicted from anchors in Figure 5. Al-
though such predicted endpoints are not used during infer-
ence of our approach, we visualize them for in-depth under-
standing of what is embedded in the learned anchors. As
illustrated in this figure, one can see that the predicted end-
points lie in road areas and mostly follow lane centerlines,
which validates that the learned anchors have well encoded
the scene context. Also, the predicted endpoints are posi-
tioned reasonably close to ground truth or the endpoints of
other possible behavior modes, revealing the efficacy of an-
chor learning in our network.
Hydra Prediction Heads. Finally, we show each individ-
ual prediction result of the hydra heads in Figure 6. This is
a challenging scenario as the target agent is static. We ob-serve that the three prediction heads produce complemen-
tary diverse trajectories. After ensembling, the multimodal
coverage of final output is further improved. These predic-
tion results collectively verify our hydra-head design of ran-
domly selecting subsets from AiP to enrich multimodality
and encourage complementary prediction.
5. Conclusion
We have presented ProphNet, an agent-centric prediction
model with anchor-informed proposals for efficient multi-
modal motion forecasting. ProphNet involves uniform en-
coding of heterogeneous input to construct a unified fea-
ture representation space AcSR, generating proposals and
anchors to form AiP, and feeding AiP into hydra prediction
heads to produce the multimodal output trajectories. Exten-
sive experimental results on the two popular benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of
both prediction accuracy and inference latency. We hope
this work would encourage more research toward practical
network designs considered for real-world driving deploy-
ment, with not only high accuracy but also succinct archi-
tecture and efficient inference.

9Appendix
In Section A, we report additional comparisons with
the leaderboard results on the two benchmarks. Section B
presents the visualization of learned attentions across multi-
sourced input. Section C describes the details regarding the
latency evaluation of various methods. Section D shows
more qualitative results to illustrate the prediction of the
proposed approach. Section E provides more ablation study.
A. ProphNet on Leaderboards
In the main paper, we have compared ProphNet with
various published methods in Tables 2 and 3. Here we
present more comparisons with the leading results (at the
time of submission) including both published and unpub-
lished methods that are reported on the leaderboards of
Arogoverse-11and Argoverse-22.
To compare with the leaderboard results on Arogoverse-
1, we follow the common practice of model ensembling
and train six models with different random seeds. We then
simply use non-maximum suppression to merge all pre-
dicted trajectories to produce the final prediction output. As
demonstrated in Table 6, ProphNet ranks the 1st among all
278 submissions.
As for the leaderboard comparison on Arogoverse-2, we
train three different models for ensembling, similar as that
in Argoverse-1. As shown in Table 7, ProphNet ranks 2nd
among all 32 submissions.
We then collect and compare the leading methods from
the two leaderboards to see their generalizability across dif-
ferent benchmarks. As listed in Table 8, one can find that
only ProphNet and QCNet (unpublished) yield stable and
superior performance on both leaderboards.
To sum up, ProphNet achieves the 1st rank on the leader-
board of Argoverse-1 and the 2nd rank on the leaderboard
of Argoverse-2. We have discussed the comparative study
with published methods in the main paper. However, as the
details of unpublished methods are not disclosed, we are
unable to analyze the comparison with them qualitatively.
B. Visualization of Learned Attentions
Next we visualize the learned attentions to multi-sourced
input for in-depth understanding of the internal attention
mechanism of ProphNet. Figure 7 illustrates the attention
distribution of a target agent to other neighboring agents
and road polylines. As shown in this figure, we observe that
the target agent pays more attention to its frontal and lat-
eral agents that would be potentially interacted with, while
less attention to the agents behind. For road polylines, the
target agent attends more on the frontal ones including the

straight, left or right polylines that the future trajectories
may lie on. This attention distribution learned in ProphNet
is reasonably alike how humans attend to different traffic
elements at an intersection.
C. Details on Latency Evaluation
In this section, we describe the details of evaluating in-
ference latency shown in Figure 1 and Table 4. As pointed
out in the main paper, in addition to prediction accuracy,
inference latency is an equally important measurement of
a motion forecasting model for real-world driving deploy-
ment. Table 10 lists the sources that are used to conduct the
inference latency evaluation. We employ the open-sourced
code and models, and evaluate them under the same setting
(tested with a single NVIDIA V100 GPU and the number
of agents set to 64). As a special case, since there is no
open-sourced material of Wayformer [15], we implement
the model following the specifications detailed in the ap-
pendix (Table 5) of related paper [15].
D. More Qualitative Results
We further provide more visualization of the predicted
trajectories in challenging scenarios. Figure 9 demonstrates
four representative scenes with the holistic prediction out-
put by ProphNet. As shown in this figure, (a-b) depict the
complex road topologies, where ProphNet is able to pro-
duce multiple accurate trajectories that align to the lane cen-
terlines reasonably well; and (c-d) illustrate the crowded in-
tersections, where ProphNet predicts rich and rational mul-
timodal future trajectories.

E. More Ablation Study
Table 9 provides more ablation studies for deeper under-
standing of our approach. We first compare different ways
for initializing proposal queries in (a) and (f), where the
random initialization is observed to be inferior to the or-
thogonal initialization. Figure 8 further shows the qualita-
tive comparison. We then compare different ways of fusing
proposals and anchors in (b) and (f). It is found that the
simple summation performs better than the attention that in-
curs a higher computation cost. We next compare the direct
use of anchor points with the proposed anchor embeddings
in (c) and (f), and find that the latter is superior, validat-
ing the rich goal-oriented contexts encoded in the anchor
embeddings. Finally, we compare different ways of input
sequence encoding in (d-f), where gMLP outperforms both
MLP and 1D-CNN. As for the failure cases of our approach,
we find some long-horizon trajectories predicted in chal-
lenging scenes (e.g., roundabout) are occasionally off the
road. One solution to mitigating this issue is to enforce an
off-road penalty in training.Model minADE 1minFDE 1
