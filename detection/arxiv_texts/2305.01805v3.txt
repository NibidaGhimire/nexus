Although SrNi 2P2adopts the common ThCr 2Si2structure for T≥325 K, being in an uncollapsed
tetragonal state rather than a collapsed tetragonal version, it is a special case for the ThCr 2Si2class:
on cooling below 325 K it adopts a one-third collapsed orthorhombic phase where one out of every
three P rows bond across the Sr layers. On the other hand, SrCo 2P2only exhibits the uncollapsed
ThCr 2Si2structure from room temperature down to 1.8 K. Regardless of their low-temperature
structures, neither SrNi 2P2nor SrCo 2P2manifests magnetic transitions down to 50 mK and 2 K,
respectively. In this work we report the effects of Co substitution in Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2, which allows
for tuning the transition between the one-third collapsed and the uncollapsed structure. We find
a rapid decrease of the one-third collapsed structural transition temperature with increasing Co
fraction, until reaching full suppression for x≥0.1. Substitution levels in the range 0 .11≤x≤0.58
show no signs of any transition down to 1.8 K in the magnetization or resistance measurements in
the range 1 .8≤T≤300 K. However, different magnetically ordered states emerge for x≥0.65,
and disappear for x≥0.99, recovering the known paramagnetic properties of the parent compound
SrCo 2P2. These results are summarized in a phase diagram, built upon the characterization by
energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, temperature-dependent resistance, field- and
temperature-dependent magnetization measurements done on single crystals with different Co frac-
tion. Both the magnetic and structural properties are compared to other systems with ThCr 2Si2
structure that exhibit magnetic ordering and collapsed tetragonal transitions. The magnetic order-
ing and moment formation are well described by Takahashi’s spin fluctuation theory of itinerant
electron magnetism [Y. Takahashi, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 55, 3553 (1986)].
I. INTRODUCTION
Compounds with the ThCr 2Si2crystal structure
have attracted abundant interest, offering a plethora
of tunable magnetic, electronic, structural, and super-
conducting properties1–7. Among these compounds,
some pnictides A(TM)2(Pn)2(with Agenerally an
alkali metal, alkaline earth, or rare earth, TMa tran-
sition metal and Pna pnictogen) display Pn-Pndis-
tances, across the Alayer, which are markedly smaller
than others. This has been rationalized in terms of
the bonding between Pnatoms across the layers of
Aatoms8, which results in a reduced Pn-Pndistance
as well as a smaller c-lattice parameter. The term
collapsed tetragonal (cT) has been coined to identify
those compounds, whereas those that do not present
Pn-Pnbonding are referred to as uncollapsed tetrago-
nal (ucT). This terminology was extended to members
of the CaKFe 4As4family of materials9, most com-
monly known as 1144, that can also display a half-
collapsed tetragonal (hcT) phase in which As atoms
bond across every other Alayer10–12.
The Pn-Pndistance in these systems has been
proven to be highly tunable by different means such as
applying pressure5,11–13, uniaxial strain14, and chem-
ical substitution15. This has allowed for experimental
access to a collapsed tetragonal transition in which
thePn-Pnbonds form or break, and for studies of
how this impacts the mechanical, electronic, and mag-
netic properties of these materials. The cT and hcT
transitions have been associated with changes from
magnetic to nonmagnetic states3,13,16, from supercon-
ducting to nonsuperconducting states5,11and, in addi-
tion, these transitions give rise to a remarkable pseu-
doelasticity in these materials17,18, which allows themto achieve some of the highest maximum recoverable
strains among metals14.
It is worth highlighting the case of
SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)2for which one of the end mem-
bers (SrCo 2Ge2) has a cT structure, and the other
(SrCo 2P2) has a ucT structure. Despite both of these
being paramagnetic at temperatures down to 2 K,
intermediate compositions exhibit an emergence of
ferromagnetic order16. The magnetism in this series
has been shown to occur simultaneously with the
gradual breaking of the X-Xbonds ( X= Ge, P), and
therefore the two phenomena have been theoretically
linked. In general, it has long been proposed8that
there is a decrease of the X-X σ∗antibonding band
population leading to the bond formation that takes
place in a collapsed tetragonal transition, manifested
as large anisotropic changes in the lattice parameters.
Additionally, it has been suggested that itinerant
ferromagnetism can be driven by a high density
of states with strong antibonding character at the
Fermi level19. In the case of SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)2fer-
romagnetism was therefore attributed to the gradual
population and/or depopulation of the mentioned
σ∗band, potentially hybridized with the 3 dbands
of Co16. Similar correspondence between collapsed
tetragonal material and magnetic ordering have been
observed in other systems as well15.
The case of SrNi 2P2is special in terms of
its bonding properties, compared to all the other
A(TM)2(Pn)2compounds. It presents a unique
structure that is neither ucT nor cT, but one in which
only one of every three P-P rows bonds across the
Sr layers when cooled down below 325 K20. As such,
this structure can be thought of as one-third collapsed
across the Sr plane. Since the structure is now or-arXiv:2305.01805v3  [cond-mat.str-el]  29 Jan 20252
thorhombic, SrNi 2P2exhibits a one-third collapsed
orthorhombic (tcO) structure. At room temperature
and ambient pressure, those P atoms that are bonded
are at a distance of 0 .2451 nm from each other, and
those that are not are at a distance of 0 .3282 nm,
giving an average P-P distance of 0 .3005 nm21. Addi-
tionally, SrNi 2P2can exhibit ucT and cT states under
modest changes in temperature or pressure. At tem-
peratures above 325 K, it presents a ucT structure,
with a P-P distance of 0 .3120 nm reported for 373
K21; and upon applying only 4 kbars of hydrostatic
pressure at room temperature, the structure collapses
into a cT state21.
Motivated by the unique bonding properties of
SrNi 2P2and the proposed relationship between bond-
ing instability and the emergence of itinerant mag-
netic order in other related compounds, we explore
the case of Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2. SrNi 2P2transitions
from a ucT structure into a primarily tcO phase,
but with 16.5% of ucT remaining present at room
temperature14which is relatively close to the tran-
sition temperature (325 K). In contrast, SrCo 2P2is
known to remain uncollapsed down to at least 2 K22.
In addition, neither SrNi 2P2nor SrCo 2P2exhibits any
magnetic transitions from room temperature to tem-
peratures as low as 2 K23,24. In this work we investi-
gate the effects of Co substitution, x, which allows to
tune the ucT ↔tcO transition temperature. More-
over, we report on magnetic ordering that occurs at
intermediate values of x. Despite the superficial sim-
ilarities to SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)2, and other related fam-
ilies such as Ca 1−xSrxCo2P2, we demonstrate that
Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2is inherently different from all the
other previously explored examples and challenges the
the proposed relationship between bonding and the
emergence of itinerant magnetism in these systems.
II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Single crystals of Sr( TM)2P2were obtained by
high-temperature solution growth method25out of Sn
flux. Pure metals were loaded into a 2 ml alumina
fritted Canfield crucible set26,27, and sealed under
partial atmosphere of argon in a fused silica tube.
Starting compositions of Sr 1.3(Ni1−xCox)2P2.3Sn16
were used for lower-doped ( x < 0.7) crystals and
Sr1.2(Ni1−xCox)2P2Sn20for higher dopings. The am-
poules were placed inside a box furnace, held for 6
hours at 600◦C before increasing to 1180◦C, dwelled
for 24 hours to make sure the material was fully
melted, and finally slowly cooled down over 100 hours
to 950◦C−1000◦C, the temperature at which the ex-
cess Sn was decanted with the aid of a centrifuge. The
decanting temperature was optimized in order to max-
imize homogeneity in composition, and lower temper-
atures down to 950◦C were needed for compositions
with x <0.25. Details on this are further described
in Appendix A.
The Co concentration levels ( x) were determined by
energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) quantita-
tive chemical analysis using an EDS detector (Thermo
NORAN Microanalysis System, model C10001) at-tached to a JEOL scanning electron microscope
(SEM). An acceleration voltage of 22 kV, working
distance of 10 mm, and takeoff angle of 35◦were
used for measuring all standards and crystals with un-
known composition. Single crystals of SrNi 2P2and of
SrCo 2P2were used as standards for Sr, Ni, Co, and
P quantification. The spectra were fitted using NIST-
DTSA II Microscopium software28. The composition
of each platelike crystal was measured at different po-
sitions on the crystal’s face (perpendicular to c), as
well as at different points across the edge of the crys-
tal (along c). The average compositions and error bars
were obtained from these data, accounting for both in-
homogeneity and goodness of fit of each spectra.
Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were
performed using a Rigaku MiniFlex II powder diffrac-
tometer with Cu K αradiation ( λ= 1.5406 ˚A). For
each composition, a few crystals were finely ground
to powder and dispersed evenly on a single-crystal Si
zero-background holder, with the aid of a small quan-
tity of vacuum grease. Intensities were collected for 2 θ
ranging from 5◦to 100◦, in step sizes of 0 .01◦, count-
ing for 4 s at each angle. Rietveld refinement was per-
formed on each spectrum using the GSAS II software
package29. Refined parameters included but were not
limited to phase fractions, lattice parameters, atomic
positions and isotropic displacements.
DC magnetization measurements were carried out
on a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measure-
ment System (MPMS classic) superconducting quan-
tum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (op-
erated in the range 1 .8≤T≤350 K, |H| ≤50 kOe).
Each sample was measured with the field applied par-
allel and perpendicular to the tetragonal caxis. Most
measurements were performed under zero-field cool-
ing (ZFC) protocols, but field cooling (FC) protocols
were also employed in some cases. The samples were
glued on a Kel-F disk which was placed inside a plas-
tic straw; the contribution of the disk to the mea-
sured magnetic moment was independently measured
in order to subtract it from our results. The samples
used for these measurements have a platelike shape,
where the dimensions along the crystallographic aand
baxes are at least ten times larger than the dimen-
sion along the caxis. This results in demagnetization
factors that are lower than 0.1 for the cases where the
magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the caxis.
Hence, the product of the demagnetization factor and
the magnetization values are much smaller than the
applied magnetic fields for those cases. For the cases
with the field applied parallel to the caxis, despite
having a larger demagnetization factor, the magneti-
zation values correspond to less than 0.4% of the ap-
plied magnetic field, so the demagnetization field can
be neglected even for the maximum possible demag-
netization factor of 1.
Temperature-dependent resistance measurements
were performed in closed-cycle cryostat Janis SHI-
950, with phosphor–bronze wires (QT-36, LakeShore,
Inc.) used on the probe. Temperature was measured
by a calibrated Cernox-1030 sensor connected to a
LakeShore 336 controler. The sample AC resistance
was measured with LakeShore AC resistance bridges3
(Models 370 and 372), with a frequency of 17 Hz and
3 mA excitation current. In some cases, AC resistance
was also measured using a Quantum Design Physi-
cal Property Measurement System (PPMS) using the
ACT option, with the same frequency and excitation
current. Only in-plane resistance was measured, using
a standard four-contact geometry. Electrical contacts
with less than 1 .5 Ω resistance were achieved by spot-
welding 25 µm Pt wire to the samples, followed by
adding Epotek H20E silver epoxy, and curing the lat-
ter for 1 hour at 120◦C.
III. RESULTS
The Co substitution determined by EDS, xEDS, is
shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the nominal Co
fraction, xnominal , that was originally used to create
the high-temperature solution out of which the crys-
tals were grown. For all the dopings explored in this
work, xEDSwas larger than xnominal . If any, inhomo-
geneities were not detected when measuring at differ-
ent positions on the platelike crystal’s surface facets
(perpendicular to the caxis) but rather for differ-
ent points across the edge of the crystal (along the
caxis). Although these were minimized by adjust-
ing the decanting temperature in the crystal growth
procedure (as detailed in Appendix A), some degree
of inhomogeneity can still be detected as seen in the
error bars in the samples with 0 .2≤xnominal ≤0.5,
or 0.58≤xEDS≤0.85 (Fig. 1). More details on
this can be found in Appendix A. It should be men-
tioned that, given the sensitivity of the magnetic prop-
erties to xwhen approaching pure SrCo 2P2, samples
with small differences in xwere studied. In particu-
lar, the xEDSmeasured on two of the samples was the
same (0.98) within the resolution of the measurement
(0.01), even though they were obtained from different
batches and show differences in the analyzed proper-
ties in this work, and are thus both reported sepa-
rately in this work. For simplicity, in the rest of this
paper the bare symbol xwill be used to refer to the
Co fraction determined by EDS.
Figure 2 shows the a- and c-lattice parameters ob-
tained by Rietveld refinement of the powder XRD pat-
terns measured at room temperature as a function
ofx. The tcO and ucT phases are distinguishable
from each other due to the fact that they belong to
different space groups. Particularly, the tcO (space
group Immm ) phase exhibits peaks that are forbid-
den for the ucT (space group I4/mmm ) due to the
former’s reduced symmetry. When performing the re-
finement, coexistence of both phases was allowed, and
lattice parameters of both phases were refined. The
open symbols in the figure correspond to the lattice
parameters of the tcO phase, whereas the solid sym-
bols correspond to those of the ucT phase. As shown,
coexistence of both phases at room temperature was
found for pure SrNi 2P2, consistent with previous re-
ports which indicate that the two structures are co-
herently connected in a two-phase single crystal14. On
the other hand, all the Co-doped crystals ( x≥0.023)
resulted in single-phase ucT material at room tem-

out of.
perature with no detectable peaks indicative of tcO
phase within experimental resolution. This is consis-
tent with the expected role of Co in suppressing the
tcO transition, stabilizing the ucT phase at room tem-
perature (see Figs. 3 and 5 below).
Figure 2 also shows that, at x= 0, the ucT phase
has a significantly larger c-lattice parameter than
the tcO phase, by ∆ c(0)∼0.25˚A. This jump is
comparatively smaller than the one observed for the
pressure-induced transition at 4 kbars which goes from
c= 10.40˚A (in the tcO phase) to c= 9.76˚A (in the
cT phase)21. An additional significant increase of cis
observed for the ucT phase due to further Co substi-
tution, with a change of 0 .9˚A across the full compo-
sition range. Even though a relatively small amount
of Co is needed to fully stabilize the uncollapsed state
at ambient temperature, there is a clearly enhanced
sensitivity of cwith xbeyond the structural transi-
tion. This change in c-lattice parameter is compara-
ble to that seen between BaNi 2P221and BaCo 2P230
(∼0.6˚A)30, but is significantly larger than that seen
in other 122 compounds31–33.
Much smaller changes were observed in the a-lattice
parameter between tcO and ucT phases at x= 0
[it should be noted that the value used for the tcO
phase was the average of the a= 3.9601(5) and
b/3 = 3 .9591(6) lattice parameters]. However, a large
decrease of acan be observed (blue solid symbols)
with increasing x. This effect compensates the de-
crease of c, resulting in a nearly constant unit cell
volume Vof the ucT phase across the full composi-
tion range, as shown in the inset in Fig. 2. In fact
the variations in Vare of 1.8%, which is very close to
the percentage difference in volume of 1 .6% between
Ni and Co pure fccmetals34, and contrasts with the
8.0% change in cand 3.9% change in a. This compen-
sation of lattice parameter changes is not uncommon,
and often occurs in other systems.
Temperature-dependent resistance and anisotropic
magnetization data were collected for all samples.
Figure 3 presents these data for various ranges of4

cell volume (inset) at room temperature as a function of the
Co fraction, xEDS. The lattice parameters and volume of the
cT phase under a pressure21of 4 kbar are shown with open
star symbols, and those of the ucT phase at a temperature of
373 K21are shown with solid star symbols. The ucT and cT
symbols (stars) are connected with a dotted line so as to help
illustrate the respective changes in a- and c-lattic parameters.
x.M/H was obtained for the magnetic field applied
perpendicular to the caxis (parallel to the basal a-b
plane) shown in Fig. 3(e)-(h), as well as parallel to
the crystallographic caxis shown in Fig. 3(i)-(l), fol-
lowing a ZFC protocol. The M(T)/His expressed in

of

where Mis the measured magnetic moment, His the
applied field and nf.u.is the number of moles of for-
mula units present in the measured crystal, which is
multiplied by 2 to account for the fact that there are
two transition metals per formula unit of Sr TM 2P2.
In addition, anisotropic field-dependent magnetiza-
tion data were collected for T= 2 K; these data are
shown in Fig. 4. From all of these sets of data we are
able to assemble a T-xphase diagram (shown in Fig.
5) for the Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2system. In the sections
below we will examine different regions in detail. For
small x-values ( x < 0.10) we see a monotonic sup-
pression of the tcO transition temperature. For inter-
mediate xvalues (0 .10< x < 0.50) no signatures of
any phase transition are found for 2 K < T < 300 K.
For higher xvalues (0 .58< x < 0.99) we find sig-
natures of magnetic, first antiferromagnetic (AFM)
and ultimately ferromagnetic (FM), transitions form-
ing a peaked-dome-like structure. The latter can be
regarded as weak itinerant ferromagnetism, since the
saturation magnetization values correspond to frac-
tions of a µBper transition metal atom, and the or-
dering temperatures are low (see further discussion
below). At the highest x-value region (x = 0.99,
1.00) there is again no detectable phase transition for
T > 1.8 K. In the following sections we will discuss
these regions is greater detail.
For the compositions shown in Fig. 3(a), a sharpsteplike feature in the temperature-dependent resis-
tance can be identified as a fingerprint of the tcO ↔
ucT structural transition temperature TS. For some of
these compositions, temperature-dependent magneti-
zation also revealed a more subtle step when the field
was applied perpendicular to the caxis (Fig. 3(e)),
although it was not clearly observed for all of them,
since the magnetic signal of the structural transition
for these xvalues was small and becoming comparable
to the noise. TSdecreases with increasing x, dropping
below 2 K between x= 0.066 and x= 0.11.
For samples with x >0.1 no such step-like feature
is observed for resistivity [Figs. 3(b)-(d)] or magneti-
zation measurements [Figs. 3(f)-(h) and (j)-(d)], in-
dicating that the ucT phase is stable down to 1 .8 K
for 0.11≤x≤0.58. All this is, once more, consis-
tent with the fact that Co stabilizes the uncollapsed
state. More specifically, Figs. 3(b), (f) and (j) show
no transition whatsoever for 0 .11≤x≤0.58. A broad
shoulderlike, crossover feature in the resistance can be
observed for some of the compositions in Fig. 3(b).
The origin or possible significance of this feature is
not yet understood, and no correlation to the mag-
netization measurements of Figs. 3(f) and 3(j) seems
to be found. Figures 4(a) and 4(d) show the M(H)
isotherms for 1.8 K for samples with x≤0.58 for fields
parallel and perpendicular to caxis. Both directions
of applied field are consistent with nonmagnetically
ordered states with the samples becoming increasingly
more polarizable with increasing x.
The magnetization data displayed in Figs. 3(g) and
3(k), as well as Figs. 4(b) and 4(e), suggest that
AFM behavior is observed at low temperatures for
the compositions ranging between x= 0.65 and x=
0.91. This is more clearly noted in the temperature-
dependent magnetization measured at H= 0.1 kOe
(Fig. 3 insets) than at H= 10 kOe (Fig. 3, main
panels). Figure 13 of Appendix B shows in more de-
tail the measurements done at H= 0.1 kOe for both
directions following a ZFC protocol, as well as fol-
lowing a FC protocol for H⊥cfor the samples with
0.58≤x≤0.91. The magnetization results at 0 .1 kOe
allow for the determination of the magnetic transition
temperature TN, plotted on the T−xphase diagram
shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 6(a) shows the case of x= 0.88
as an example. Since the applied field of 0.1 kOe is
within the range in which Mis proportional to H, the
DC magnetic susceptibility can be obtained as
χj=Mj(H= 0.1 kOe)
0.1 kOe, (2)
where jindex stands for the fact that the field can be
applied perpendicular ( j=⊥) or parallel ( j=||) to
thecaxis. The polycrystalline average of the suscep-
tibility can be defined as

given that these systems present tetragonal symmetry.
In the inset, d(χaveT)/dTis plotted as a function of
temperature, displaying a clear feature at T= 36 K.
According to Ref. [ 35], this magnitude should scale
with the specific heat Cp(T) for Tclose to TN, in-
dicating the presence of an antiferromagnetic phase5

transition at TN= 36 K, which was determined as
the temperature at which the slope of the function
f(T) =d(χaveT)/dTis maximum. d(χaveT)/dTdata
for all the compositions are shown in detail in Fig. 13
of Appendix B. As can be appreciated in the insets of
Figs. 3(g) and 3(k), as well as in Fig. 13, the tran-
sitions observed for x= 0.64−0.85 are significantly
broader than for x= 0.87−0.91. The former compo-
sitions are those with larger degree of composition in-
homogeneity, as shown in Fig. 1, which could explain
the increase in the transition width. Moreover, due
to the presence of a local maximum in the phase dia-
gram of Fig. 5, the sensitivity of the apparent width
ofTNtoxfor the range x= 0.87−0.91 is lower than
forx= 0.64−0.85, where TN(x) has a larger slope.
This implies that a given spread of compositions in an
individual sample has less impact on the spread of the
transition temperatures for x= 0.87−0.91.The resistance measurements for the compositions
in the 0 .87≤x≤0.91 range exhibit a loss of spin dis-
order scattering. Since this feature is too subtle to be
observed in Fig. 3(c), the case of x= 0.88 is presented
as an example in Fig. 6(b), where the green curve
corresponds to the resistance normalized to its room-
temperature value, and magenta curve corresponds to
its derivative dRnorm/dT. The latter can be used to
identify TN, since its magnetic contribution should
vary like the magnetic specific heat36.
The possibility of having a spin glass instead of
an AFM state for some of the compositions in the
0.65≤x≤0.91 range cannot be completely ignored.
However, this is a less likely scenario due to the fol-
lowing reasons: (1) the fact that there is no measur-
able difference (irreversibility) between the ZFC and
FC magnetization measurements as shown in Fig. 13
of Appendix B, (2) the appearance of metamagnetic6

per transition metal atom, for the applied field perpendicular to
c(panels (a)-(c)) as well as parallel to c(panels (d)-(f)). Panels

to 1.8 K; (b) and (e) to samples with AFM order; (c) and (f)
to samples with FM order.
transitions in the M(H) behavior, and (3) the obser-
vation of loss-of-spin-disorder scattering in some of the
resistance curves as an indication of some long-range
magnetic ordering being established. In order to en-
tirely rule out the possibility of a spin glass instead
of a long-range AFM state, neutron diffraction exper-
iments should be carried out on these samples, which
are outside of the scope of the current work. Other
factors regarding this topic are addressed in the Dis-
cussion section.
Figures 3(h) and 3(l), as well as Fig. 4(c), reveal a
behavior consistent with a magnetically ordered state
with a FM component at low temperatures. The cri-
terion of Ref. [ 35] does not hold to determine a FM
transition temperature TC. Unfortunately, the loss-
of-spin-disorder scattering in the electrical transport
measurements was not resolvable for samples that re-
vealed FM-like behavior. Even though loss-of-spin-
disorder scattering may still occur in these samples
upon cooling below TC, the feature is too weak to be
detected within our experimental resolution.
In order to determine TCvalues, Arrott plots37were
constructed for the samples that exhibit a FM tran-
sition. For this, field-dependent magnetization was
measured at different temperatures, keeping Hper-
pendicular to the caxis. Figure 7 shows M2plotted
as a function of H/M for a sample with x= 0.98,
displaying a linear dependence as expected for a sys-
tem that behaves according to the mean-field theory.
A linear regression can be used to fit the higher fieldbehavior observed for all the temperatures measured.
This linear behavior can be extrapolated to zero field,
in order to determine whether TCis higher or lower
than the temperature at which the measurement was
performed. The inset of the figure shows that the in-
tercepts of the linear fits follow a clear trend with tem-
perature, being positive for T < 6.5 K and negative
forT > 6.5 K. A linear fit was performed for those
points closest to the x-axis intercept. The x-axis in-
tercept was taken as the best estimate for TC, and the
corresponding error was derived by propagation of the
errors of the linear fit parameters, obtaining a result
ofTC= 6.6±0.4 K. Similar results are shown in the
Appendix C for other compositions. For some of the
selected samples, as the ones shown in Figs. 7 and 17,
the field-dependent magnetization measured at 2 K
exhibits a small steplike feature at H∼200 Oe due
to the superconducting signal of Sn impurity, which
is emphasized when plotting M2in an Arrott plot.
Nevertheless, a change from negative concavity of the
curves for temperatures below TC(red, orange, and
yellow curves) to positive concavity above TC(green,
blue, and purple curves) can be appreciated at low
fields, as expected in Arrott plots37.

ical temperatures determined: TS(green symbols from resis-
tance measurements, and light green symbols from magnetiza-
tion measurements), TN(red symbols from magnetization mea-
surements and purple symbols from resistance measurements)
andTC(blue symbols from magnetization measurements) as a
function of Co fraction, x. Inset: enlarged view of the magnetic
region of the phase diagram. Different colors are used to indi-
cate the different phases: green for tcO paramagnetic, white for
ucT paramagnetic, pink for ucT AFM, and light-blue for ucT
FM.
All the critical temperatures determined, TS,TN
andTC, are shown in the temperature-composition
phase diagram depicted in Fig. 5 (above). This
summarizes the effects of varying xfrom 0 to 1 in
Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2. For low concentrations of Co it can
be seen how the tcO ←→ucT transition temperature
decreases, and that the tcO state is fully suppressed
forx > 0.1. Moreover, upon further substitution
(x >0.58) an AFM-like state emerges, and its transi-
tion temperature reaches a maximum TN∼36 K for7
x∼0.9. Beyond this doping, the transition temper-
ature rapidly decreases, and the transition becomes
ferromagnetic in nature. Finally, as Co concentra-
tion approaches x= 1, the weak ferromagnetism is
suppressed until reaching the nonmagnetically ordered
(i.e. paramagnetic) SrCo 2P2.
Systematic changes of the FM transition temper-
ature with x, as shown in blue in Fig. 5, sug-
gest that ferromagnetism is intrinsically coming from
Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2, rather than from a possible sec-
ondary phase with a fixed composition. However, the
results presented are not sufficient to conclude that
the samples as a whole are FM. Since the change from
AFM to FM-like behavior occurs suddenly in a small
range of x, small inhomogeneities of xwithin the EDS
measurement resolution could lead to part of the sam-
ple being FM while another part being AFM. But even
if that were not the case and the whole sample had
homogeneous magnetic properties, a magnetic order
with coexisting FM and AFM components cannot be
ruled out for the compositions with 0 .95< x < 0.99,
based on the measurements presented here. For these
reasons, despite identifying these samples as FM for
simplicity, all that can be stated is that they present a
nonzero FM component. Further measurements, such
as neutron diffraction, will be needed to further refine
our understanding of this state.

As already mentioned, Fig. 2 shows that the
Ni-Co substitution in Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2leads to a
significant change in the c-lattice parameter not
only at the tcO transition but also across the
whole ucT region. Figure 8 shows the c-axis evo-
lution of Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2compared to that of
SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)216and Ca 1−xSrxCo2P215. Each of
these systems has a cT or tcO transition, and each of
these systems has a magnetic order that evolves with
substitution.

at different constant temperatures for a sample with x= 0.98,
and their corresponding linear fits (solid lines). Inset: Value
of the intercept obtained from the linear fits for the different
temperatures.
Qualitatively the three systems have very similar
behavior as xis reduced from 1.0 to 0.7. Whereas
one may anticipate a shrinking of the unit cell volume
(and c-lattice parameter) for the substitution of Ca
for Sr, a similar shrinkage for the substitution of Ge
for P is counterintuitive38,39. Given the similarity of
these three systems for 0 .7< x < 1.0, it is reason-
able to argue that the effects the P-P bond instability
persist to this range and may the common root of the
observed changes in c-lattice parameter. Over a wider
substitution range, the similarities disappear since the
nature of the collapse and the compositions at which
it occurs differ for each system. It is relevant to point
out that the Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2system is unique in that
there is no transition to a cT state induced by doping,
in contrast to SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)2and Ca 1−xSrxCo2P2.
Instead, the former only undergoes a transition into
a tcO state very close to the SrNi 2P2end, and needs
an additional applied pressure of 4 kbars in order to
decrease the value of cto 9.76˚A and fully collapse
into a cT state21.
All three systems included in Fig. 8 exhibit mag-
netic ordering upon perturbing the Stoner enhanced
SrCo 2P2. The blue points correspond to FM order,
and the magenta points to AFM order. In the case of
SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)2, the ferromagnetism has been at-
tributed to the gradual population and/or depopula-
tion of the σ∗band, potentially hybridized with the8
3dbands16. It has been suggested that itinerant ferro-
magnetism can be driven by strong antibonding char-
acter of the bands at the chemical potential19. FM or-
der in the SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)2is limited to the composi-
tions 0 .3< x < 0.7 [see Fig. 8(b), blue points], which
corresponds to the region with the fastest change of
thec-lattice parameter as consequence of a gradual
breaking and/or formation of the bonds. In the case of
Ca1−xSrxCo2P2magnetic ordering also appears in the
high-slope region associated to the cT transition, and
extends to the pure CaCo 2P2compound. In addition,
the nature of the magnetic order in Ca 1−xSrxCo2P2
is FM for some compositions [see panel (c), blue
points], and AFM for others (magenta points). Fi-
nally, Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2presents both FM and AFM
order, and the latter extends to a significantly wider
range in xthan the former. Magnetic ordering in this
case is well removed from the collapse into the tcO
phase. By comparing Figs. 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c), it
becomes clear that the size of the clattice parameter
by itself is not the factor for magnetism, since mag-
netic order appears: (a) for 11 .42˚A< c < 11.62˚A
in Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2; (b) for 10 .77˚A< c < 11.33 in
SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)2; (c) for 9 .59˚A< c < 10.74˚A for
Ca1−xSrxCo2P2.

(a) Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2, (b) SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)216, and (c)
Ca1−xSrxCo2P215. The compositions that exhibit FM behav-
ior are marked in blue, and those that exhibit AFM behavior
are marked in magenta. Additionally, the c-lattice parameter
for SrNi 2P2in the tcO phase (open red circles) and in the cT
phase under pressure21(solid red star) are included.
The case of Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2shows that the emer-
gence of magnetism need not coincide with the break-
ing or forming of the P-P bonds. In the case of
SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)2, substitution of P with Ge causes
the system to be electron deficient with respect to
SrCo 2P2, and in the case of Ca 1−xSrxCo2P2the elec-
tron count remains the same since it corresponds to
isovalent substitution. In contrast, substituting Co
with Ni adds electrons to the system, which may be a
relevant factor that enables Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2to ex-
hibit magnetism farther away from the lattice col-
lapse, as opposed to the other two cases. In fact,
itinerant ferromagnetism was also observed for elec-
tron doping in SrCo 2As240.
In order to discuss the M(H) isotherms shown in
Fig. 4 in more detail, the data for x= 0.88 and
x= 0.94 are plotted separately in the main panelsof Fig. 9 for both directions H⊥c(blue) and H||c
(red). The data in Fig. 9(a) for H⊥c(in blue) re-
veal the presence of metamagnetic transitions, which
are present in the samples with 0 .74≤x≤0.91.
This includes the jump in magnetization observed
forH≈8 kOe as well as the change in slope for
H≈19 kOe, for x= 0.88. The presence of metamag-
netic transitions is a common characteristic displayed
in systems with long-range finite qmagnetic order,
and hence is consistent with the proposed AFM or-
der.
The values of the extrapolated moment, µs, can be
found from the M(H) isotherms. The main panel
of Fig. 9(b) reflects most clearly the fact that the
high field behavior of MvsHis not strictly linear.
Instead, as shown in the insets of Fig. 9, the high
field data for H⊥cfollow a linear dependence of M2
with H/M , as expected for an itinerant magnet at
low temperatures41. For all compositions in the range
0.65≤x≤0.98, the square roots of the y-intercepts
of the linear fits are taken as estimates for µs, and
its values are shown in Table II and plotted in Fig.
10(b). The value of µsincreases from zero to a max-
imum value of 0 .150µB/TM forx= 0.88, and then
decreases back to zero as it approaches the composi-
tion of SrCo 2P2. This behavior resembles that of the
magnetic transition temperature with x[Fig. 10(a),
red symbols].

sition metal) as a function of the applied magnetic field Hper-

In addition, Curie-Weiss dependence of some of the
samples was examined in detail. Polycrystalline aver-
ages of the magnetic susceptibility χwere extracted
from the high temperature dependence of the DC
magnetic susceptibility χ=M/H atH= 10 kOe
forHapplied perperndicular ( χ⊥) and parallel ( χ||)
to the caxis. The temperature dependencies of χare
plotted in red (left axis) in Fig. 15 in Appendix B.
Given that, for the AFM compounds, this field is com-
parable to the metamagnetic field for H⊥c(e.g., see
Fig. 9), the presented data can only be considered as
χ(T) for temperatures well above TNorTC. As such,
we only analyze our data for 100 K < T < 300 K.
A nonlinear fit was applied for the polycrystalline av-
eraged susceptibilities, according to the following the
equation
χ=C
T−θCW+χ0. (4)
The best fitted curve is plotted with a black line. Fig-
ure 15 also shows ( χ−χ0)−1in blue (right axis), for
0.58≤x≤0.98. The linear behavior of ( χ−χ0)−1
for the fitting range supports the correspondence of
the observed behavior of χ(T) to the fitted model.
The temperature dependence measured for samples
with x= 0.99 and x= 1 does not follow Curie-Weiss
(CW) law, consistent with previous reports on pure
SrCo 2P242.
The parameters obtained from our CW fits for
0.58< x < 0.98 are summarized in the Table I, as
well as in Fig. 10. The values of θCWandχ0were ob-
tained directly from the fit, whereas µeffwas obtained
from the fitted Curie constant C, according to
C=NAµ2
eff
3kB, (5)
where NAis the Avogadro number and kBis Boltz-
mann constant. The resulting µeffin units of emu
per atom of transition metal was divided by µB=
9.27×10−21emu in order to express it in units of Bohr
magnetons, µB, per transition metal atom. The values
ofχ0forx <0.43 were estimated as χ0=χ(300 K),
since those data did not fit to a Curie-Weiss behav-
ior but were almost constant at high temperatures.
This is not the case for x≥0.99 that do not follow
Curie-Weiss law, but the relative variations in χare
large, hence χ0was not estimated for those composi-
tions. The error bars were obtained by propagating
the standard errors of the fitting parameters. In the
case of µeffandχ0an additional contribution to the
error was obtained by propagating the error in the
mass of the measured crystals, whereas for θCWan
error of 0 .1 K in the measurement of temperature was
added to the standard error of the fit. The reason for
the anomalously high value of θCWfor the composi-
tionx= 0.58 right below the emergence of magnetic
ordering is unclear, although a similar behavior was
observed in Sr(Co 1−xNix)2As243.
As shown in Fig. 10, values of µeffincrease as a
function of x, whereas the values of −θCWfollow the
nonmonotonic behaviour of TNand, therefore, its de-
pendence is reminiscent of the one manifested in the
phase diagram (Fig. 5). Moreover, the values of µeffx Tmag θCW µeff/TM χ 0×106

TABLE I. Parameters obtained from the nonlinear Curie-Weiss
fits, and magnetic transition temperatures. For x < 0.43 and
x >0.98 the data did not correspond to the fitting model, so the
fitting parameters are not included in the table. The value of
χ0forx <0.43 was estimated as χ0=χ(300K). As mentioned
in the text, the two compositions listed as x= 0.98 correspond
to different batches and, despite not being able to resolve their
differences by EDS, they show differences in their properties.
are significantly larger that the values of µsshown in
Fig. 10(b). A local maximum of χ0, which can ul-
timately be related to the density of states near the
Fermi level, occurs at similar compositions as the max-
imum of Tmag,−θCWandµs.
Given that values of µsin these metallic samples
are small compared to µeff, it should not be surpris-
ing that the observed behavior is in good agreement
with the spin fluctuation theory of itinerant electron10
magnetism44, which, though in principle, only appli-
cable to weak itinerant ferromagnets, has been ex-
tended to itinerant antiferromagnets as well43. There-
fore, it is reasonable to rationalize the effect of Co sub-
stitution on the magnetic properties in terms of band
filling, rather than changes in the exchange couplings
of an anisotropic Heisenberg model as argued for local
moment systems.

other well-known itinerant ferromagnets41,44–46. The

This theory has also been applied to systems that
are not strictly ferromagnetic but, with a finite mag-
netic field applied, exhibit typical characteristics of
weak itinerant ferromagnets43,47. For the present
work, the cases with x= 0.65,x= 0.85 and x= 0.87
were analyzed in detail by constructing Arrott plots
(see Figs. 18-20 in Appendix C). The criteria for de-
termining T∗
Cof the high field state was applied by fit-
ting the high field results, obtaining slightly lower val-
ues than the AFM ordering temperatures. The slope
and intercept of the high field results at T= 2 K were
used to estimate the spectral parameter T0, similar to
what was done for the ferromagnetic samples. The
results obtained (solid red stars in main panel of Fig.11
11) also lay within the theoretical prediction repre-
sented by the dashed line, indicating that the mag-
netic ordering in this system is itinerant not only for
0.96< x < 0.98, but for lower compositions as well.

and 46. The dashed line represents the theoretically expected
dependence given by equation 7. (Inset) Modified Deguchi-
Takahashi plot, for the FM (solid blue stars) as well as AFM
(solid red stars) samples.
Table II also shows that µeff/µscovers wide range
for the system Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2, spanning about an
order of magnitude. This occurs in a nonmonotonic
way, with the values of µeff/µsdecreasing with xuntil
reaching a minimum for x= 0.88 (near the maximum
of the dome in the phase diagram), and then increas-
ing until reaching its maximum of 107 for x= 0.98.
The values of T0are significantly greater than the or-
dering temperatures, consistent with weak itinerant
magnetism for which this theory is applicable.
Assuming that TNand the Arrott-plot-inferred T∗
C
are close for the other AFM samples as well, we can
plot all of our data on a modified Deguchi-Takahashi
plot (see inset of Fig. 11) using Tmag/˜T0data, where
Tmagis taken as TCorTNfor the FM and AFM sam-
ples, respectively. Since the calculation of T0requires
the value of the Curie temperature as seen in Eq. 6,
which was not estimated for all of the AFM samples,
a new parameter was defined as
˜T0=20Tmag

The values of this parameter are included in Table III
in Appendix C, which show a notably large disper-
sion since it relies on the assumed proximity between
TNandT∗
C. However, the purpose of this analysis is
to show the negative correlation between µeff/µsand
Tmag/˜T0. The extent to which these data agree with
the theoretical prediction represented with the dashed
line is strongly dependent on the degree of similarity
between TNand the inferred T∗
Cfor the AFM sam-
ples, which was only evaluated for three of the AFM
samples in this work.V. CONCLUSION
This study shows how Co substitution in
Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2can serve to gradually decrease the
ucT↔tcO transition, until suppressing it fully at
x∼0.1. Further substitution (0 .11≤x≤0.58)
leads to having the ucT phase in the full tempera-
ture range explored, with no other phase transition
detected for 2 K≤T≤300 K. For 0 .64≤x≤0.94
antiferromagnetic ordering appears, initially with TN
increasing with x, and ultimately decreasing and giv-
ing rise to ferromagnetic order for 0 .96≤x≤0.98.
Curie temperature decreases monotonically with xun-
til full suppression, giving paramagnetic behavior for
x≥0.99.
By comparing the Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2,
Ca1−xSrxCo2P2and SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)2systems
we find that there is no ”special” c-axis value for
the stabilization of the magnetic region. In addition,
compared to Ca 1−xSrxCo2P2and SrCo 2(Ge1−xPx)2
systems, Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2is the only one for which
the region with AFM and/or FM ordering evolves
well removed from any collapse of the structure.
Magnetism in these systems appears to be well
parametrized by Takahasi’s theory for itinerant elec-
tron magnetism, as shown by the six compositions in
which the Deguchi-Takahashi analysis was performed.

APPENDIX A
During the crystal growth process, when a low de-
canting temperature ( T∼700◦C) was used, EDS
measurements indicated inhomogeneous Co and Ni
distributions across a polished edge of the crystal
(along c). This is represented in the upper panel of
Fig. 12 by the variation of the x-ray intensity at the
Ni (blue) and Co (red) Kαlines. This suggests that
the crystals grow richer in Co initially, and poorer as
the growth develops further, which is consistent with
the samples having higher Co fraction in the center,
and lower towards the outer surfaces. A possible rea-
son for this is the following: since the crystals initially
tend to grow with a higher Co fraction that the nom-
inal fraction contained in the crucible, as the furnace
is cooled and the crystals grow larger, the coexisting
melt gets more depleted in Co, which leads to a lower
Co fraction for the outer layers that grow later. Ex-
amining Fig. 12(a) suggested to us, then, that if we
only cooled to 1000◦C, we could effectively not grow12
the two edge regions where the large changes in the Ni-
to-Co ratio took place. Indeed, based on this hypoth-
esis, we managed to minimize the degree of inhomo-
geneity by decanting the flux at higher temperatures
(T∼1000◦C), leading to fewer and/or smaller crys-
tals, but with more homogeneous Co and Ni profiles
as a function of depth, as the one shown in the lower
panel of Fig. 12. Both examples provided correspond
to the same nominal composition Sr(Ni 0.4Co0.6)2P2.
There are two points that are important to note
about this tendency toward inhomogeneity. First, it
is associated with growing the psuedoternary, quater-
nary compound out of a vast abundance of a fifth
element (Sn) flux. Given that there is a very limited
amount of Ni and Co in the melt, as crystals grow they
can rapidly deplete one element over another. This
is a very different case from growing, for example,
Ba(Fe 1−xCox)2As2out of a quaternary melt where
there is a vast excess of (Fe 1−xCox)As melt [e.g., out
of a Ba x(Fe/Co) yAszmelt]. In this case the growth of
a small amount of crystal phase with a xEDS different
from xnominal does not shift the melt stoichiometry as
much. Second, the changing relative amount of Ni
and Co along the width of the platelike crystal shown
in Fig. 12(a) suggests that this could be a method
to create samples with tailored composition profiles if
needed.
FIG. 12. X-ray intensity, in counts per second, obtained
from EDS measurement at the energies corresponding to Ni
K-α(blue line) and Co K- α(red line), as a function of the
distance along (001) on a polished edge of a sample from the
batch decanted at 750◦C (upper pannel) and a sample from the
batch decanted at 1000◦C (lower pannel), both with the same
nominal composition of Sr(Ni 0.4Co0.6)2P2.APPENDIX B
The emergence of magnetic ordering in
Sr(Ni 1−xCox)2P2forx > 0.58 can be further
appreciated in Fig. 13. This figure shows the
temperature-dependent magnetic DC susceptibility
for 0.58≤x≤0.99 samples, measured with a field
of 100 Oe applied perpendicular (in blue) as well as
parallel (in red) to the caxis. The results show varied
magnetic behavior of the samples, ranging from
paramagnetic (e.g. x= 0.58) to antiferromagnetic
(e.g., x= 0.88) to ferromagnetic (e.g., x= 0.96).
The criteria used for determining TNare shown in
Fig. 14 for all the antiferromagentic samples stud-
ied in this work. In the same way as was presented
in the inset of Fig. 6(a) for x= 0.88, the figure in-
cludes plots of dχT/dT as a function of temperature
for the rest of the compositions in which the criteria
were used. TNwas determined as the temperature at
which the slope of the function f(T) =d(χaveT)/dT
is maximum. More specifically, the point for which
(f(Ti)−f(Ti−1))/(Ti−Ti−1) was largest, and Ti−Ti−1
was taken as the uncertainty. For those compositions
in which ( f(Ti)−f(Ti−1))/(Ti−Ti−1) was similar
for a temperature range larger than Ti−Ti−1, that
whole range was taken as the uncertainty. It addi-
tionally includes the case of x= 0.95, for which the
steplike feature is suppressed (or at least no longer
detected). The transition temperatures are indicated
with a vertical arrows. The compositions x= 0.91
andx= 0.94 apparently present two steps separated
by∼5 K from each other, so two arrows of differ-
ent colors were drawn for those cases. The underlying
reason for observing this is not clear: it could be due
to the inhomogeneity of the Co concentration in the
sample, or due to the intrinsic occurrence of two tran-
sitions. Further studies are needed in order to answer
this. For this work, in those cases only one point was
plotted in the phase diagram in Fig. 5, taken as the
average between the two arrows, and the uncertainty
such that it includes both arrows.
The temperature dependencies of χaveare plotted
in red (left axis) in Fig. 15, together with ( χ−χ0)−1
in blue (right axis), for 0 .58≤x≤0.98, for an ap-
plied field of 10 kOe in each direction, for 100 K <
T <300 K. A nonlinear fit was applied for the poly-
crystalline averaged susceptibilities, according to the
following the equation
χave=C
T−θCW+χ0. (9)
The best fitted curve is plotted with a black line. The
correspondence of the observed behavior to the fitted
model can be further supported by noticing the lin-
ear behavior of ( χ−χ0)−1for the fitting range. The
temperature dependence measured for samples with
x= 0.99 and x= 1 does not follow Curie-Weiss law
in the range 100 ≤T≤300K, as manifested by
the difference between the fit (black line) and χ(T)
(open red circles), as well as the nonlinearity of the
estimated ( χ−χ0)−1. These indications are subtle
forx= 0.99 and more obvious for x= 1.13
FIG. 13. Temperature dependent DC magnetization divided
by applied field for compositions with different Co fraction x,
measured with an applied field of 100 Oe perpendicular (blue)
and parallel (red) to the c-axis. For the samples with 0 .58≤
x≤0.91 with H⊥c, both ZFC (closed symbols) and FC
(bigger open symbols) measurements were performed. For the
rest, only ZFC measurements (closed symbols) were done.

FIG. 15. Polycrystalline average of the DC magnetic suscepti-
bility χ(red, left axis) as a function of temperature, measured
with an applied field of 10 kOe, and the Curie-Weiss fit with
a solid line (black, left axis). The values of ( χ−χ0)−1as a
function of temperature are plotted in blue (right axis). As
mentioned in the text, the two compositions listed as x= 0.98
correspond to different batches and, despite not being able to
resolve their differences by EDS, they show differences in their
properties.APPENDIX C
Arrott plots were constructed in order to determine
theTCof the three compositions identified as ferro-
magnetic in this work. The results are plotted in Figs.
16 and 17, in a similar way as done in Fig. 7 in the
main text.
FIG. 16. Main panel: M2as a function of H/M (Arrott plot)
at different constant temperatures for a sample with x= 0.96,
and their corresponding linear fits (solid lines). Inset: Value
of the intercept obtained from the linear fits for the different
temperatures. The dashed line corresponds to the fit used to
determine µsandT0.
FIG. 17. Main panel: M2as a function of H/M (Arrott plot)
at different constant temperatures for a sample with x= 0.98,
and their corresponding linear fits (solid lines). The presence of
a small step-like feature at H∼200 Oe is due to the supercon-
ducting signal of Sn impurity, and is emphasized when plotting
M2in an Arrott plot. Inset: Value of the intercept obtained
from the linear fits for the different temperatures.
Figure 16 presents a change in slope of M2vsH/M
at low fields. This feature is intrinsic to the behav-
ior of the sample, and it shares some similarity to
the changes in slope of Figs. 18-20 that occur due to
the metamagnetic transitions in the AFM samples. It
should be noted that, despite the fact that the sam-
ples with x= 0.95 and x= 0.96 show a clear FM
component as shown by the orange and yellow curves15
in Fig. 4(c), they may exhibit a more complex type
of ordering, as their compositions are near the bound-
ary between AFM and FM. Nevertheless, by plotting
M2as a function of H/M , the field-dependent behav-
ior below this feature as well as the behavior above
that feature are successfully linearized, as expected
for a mean-field theory. For the purpose of determin-
ing the Curie temperature, TC, linear fits (solid lines)
were performed for fields below this change of slope.
Figures 18-20 are modified Arrott plots for x= 0.65,
x= 0.85 and x= 0.87, respectively, which actually
order antiferromagnetically in a small applied field,
but their behavior above the metamagnetic transition
resembles that of the other ferromagnetic samples.
Therefore, linear fits were performed for the higher
field data, and used for the Deguchi-Takahashi analy-
sis. This plot provides a way of estimating a value of
T∗
Cfor the field-induced state.
FIG. 18. Main panel: M2as a function of H/M (Arrott plot)
at different constant temperatures for a sample with x= 0.65,
and their corresponding linear fits (solid lines). Inset: Value
of the intercept obtained from the linear fits for the different
temperatures.
FIG. 19. Main panel: M2as a function of H/M (Arrott plot)
at different constant temperatures for a sample with x= 0.85,
and their corresponding linear fits (solid lines). Inset: Value
of the intercept obtained from the linear fits for the different
temperatures.
FIG. 20. Main panel: M2as a function of H/M (Arrott plot)
at different constant temperatures for a sample with x= 0.87,
and their corresponding linear fits (solid lines). Inset: Value
of the intercept obtained from the linear fits for the different
temperatures.
The Arrott plots can be used in order to determine
the spectral parameter T0. According to SCR (self-
consistent renormalization) spin fluctuation theory44,
magnetic isotherms for itinerant ferromagnets follow
the equation
(gµB)H=F1M2
(N0gµB)2−µ2
s
(N0gµB)2M
N0gµB
(10)
where F1is the quartic coefficient in the Guizburg-
Landau expansion of the free energy, gis the Land´ e
factor, N0the number of moment-bearing ions, and
µsis the spontaneous magnetization. This expression
can be rearranged to
M

so that it explicitly reflects the linear behavior of an
Arrott plot. If Mandµsare written in units of µB

intercept ( µ2

Taking as an example the case of x= 0.98 shown
in Fig. 7, for the red curve corresponding to 2 K, the
slope is s= 3.86(1)×10−9µ3

In order to calculate µsandT0forx= 0.96 shown
in Fig. 16, a linear fit was performed for the range of
fields above the metamagnetic transition for x= 0.96
atT= 2 K (dashed line). This was done in order
to be consistent with the range of H/M in which the
fits were done for the Deguchi-Takahashi analysis on
the other samples, including those with AFM ground
states.
