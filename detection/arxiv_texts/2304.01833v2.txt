ABSTRACT
This paper investigates, as a ﬁrst step, the four branches of BMS transformations,
motivated by the classiﬁcation into elliptic, parabolic, h yperbolic and loxodromic proposed
a few years ago in the literature. We ﬁrst prove that to each no rmal elliptic transformation
of the complex variable ζused in the metric for cuts of null inﬁnity there corresponds a
BMS supertranslation. We then study the conformal factor in the BMS transformation of
theuvariable as a function of the squared modulus of ζ. In the loxodromic and hyperbolic
cases, this conformal factor is either monotonically incre asing or monotonically decreasing
as a function of the real variable given by the modulus of ζ. The Killing vector ﬁeld of the
Bondi metric is also studied in correspondence with the four admissible families of BMS
transformations. Eventually, all BMS transformations are re-expressed in the homogeneous
coordinates suggested by projective geometry. It is then fo und that BMS transformations
are the restriction to a pair of unit circles of a more general set of transformations. Within
this broader framework, the geometry of such transformatio ns is studied by means of its
Segre manifold.

The recent developments on the applications of the Bondi-Me tzner-Sachs (hereafter BMS)
group, i.e., the asymptotic symmetry group of an asymptotic ally ﬂat spacetime (see Eqs.
(A.1)-(A.3) of the Appendix), have been motivated by black h ole physics, quantum grav-
ity and gauge theories, as is well described in many outstand ing works (e.g. Refs. [1–15].
However, a purely classical investigation may still lead to a neater understanding of the
mathematical operations frequently performed. Within thi s framework, at least four prop-
erties can be mentioned in our opinion:
(i) The proof by F. Alessio and one of us [16] that the BMS group is the right semidirect
product of the proper orthocronous Lorentz group SO+(3,1) with supertranslations (cf.
Appendix A).
(ii) Thedivision of BMS transformations into parabolic, el liptic, hyperbolicand loxodromic,
since the ﬁrst half of them consists of fractional linear map s which can be classiﬁed by
studying their ﬁxed points [17].
(iii) The investigation of fractional linear maps in genera l relativity and quantum mechanics
performed in Ref. [18]
(iv) The proof that the BMS group is not real analytic, and the related suggestion that it
is not locally exponential [19].
(v) The recent discovery that groups of BMS type arise not onl y as macroscopic asymptotic
symmetry groups in cosmology, but describe also a fundament al microscopic symmetry of
pseudo-Riemannian geometry [20].
In the following sections, we aim at presenting a detailed in vestigation of the four
branches of the BMS group and of yet other properties. For thi s purpose, Sec. 2 deﬁnes
our basic framework, Sec. 3 obtains a new theorem on supertra nslations, Sec. 4 studies the
conformal factor in the second half of BMS transformations, while Sec. 5 studies Killing
vector ﬁelds of the Bondi metric and their behaviour under BM S transformations, obtain-
ing a novel classiﬁcation. Eventually, BMS transformation s in homogeneous coordinates
are studied in Sec. 6, concluding remarks are presented in Se c. 7, while relevant details are
provided in the Appendices. The reader is referred to Refs. [ 21–23] for the basic concepts
of causal and asymptotic structure of a spacetime manifold.
22 Basic framework
The cuts of null inﬁnity are spacelike 2-surfaces orthogona l to the generators of null inﬁnity.
Lengths within a cut scale by a variable factor Kunder holomorphic bijections of the 2-
sphereS2to itself (hereafter we use the complex variable ζ=eiφcotθ
2,φandθbeing the
standard coordinates for S2):
ζ′=f(ζ) =(aζ+b)
(cζ+d)=fΛ(ζ), (2.1)
where
Λ =
a b
c d
.
This is a fractional linear (or M¨ obius) map, and the matrix Λ can be always taken to
belong to SL(2 ,C), because the ratio is unaﬀected by rescalings of a,b,c,dby the same
factor, so that the passage from GL(2 ,C) to SL(2 ,C) is eventually achieved. In particular,
fΛ(ζ) =f−Λ(ζ), because
(aζ+b)
(cζ+d)=(−aζ−b)
(−cζ−d).
Thus, two matrices of SL(2 ,C) yield the same fractional linear map if and only if the one is
the opposite of the other. At this stage, we are actually deal ing with the projective version
of the SL(2 ,C) group, i.e.
PSL(2,C) =/braceleftbigg
(f,Λ)|f:ζ∈C→f(ζ) =(aζ+b)
(cζ+d), ad−bc= 1/bracerightbigg
= SL(2 ,C)/δ, (2.2)
whereδis the homeomorphism such that
δ(a,b,c,d) = (−a,−b,−c,−d). (2.3)
Ourdeﬁnition(2.2) of PSL(2 ,C) as a spaceof mapsis formally analogous to thedeﬁnitionof
PSL(2,R) by S. Katok [24], and it puts the emphasis on the fractional l inear map associated
to any matrix of SL(2 ,C). Such maps can be extended to the whole complex plane by
deﬁning [19]
f(∞) =a
c, f/parenleftbigg
−d
c/parenrightbigg
=∞. (2.4)
3By virtue of the above considerations, we can consider the eq uivalence relation
(fΛ,Λ)∼(fΛ′,Λ′)⇐⇒Λ′=±Λ =⇒fΛ′(ζ) =fΛ(ζ).
A cut remains the unit 2-sphere under fΛ(ζ) provided that its metric is subject to the
conformal rescaling
K2(Λ,ζ)(dθ⊗dθ+sin2θdφ⊗dφ), (2.5)
having deﬁned
K(Λ,ζ) =KΛ(ζ) =1+|ζ|2
|aζ+b|2+|cζ+d|2, (2.6)
where of course |γ|2=γγfor allγ∈C. The asymptotic theory remains invariant under
this rescaling provided that lengths along the generators o f null inﬁnity scale by the same
amount, i.e.
du′=KΛ(ζ)du, (2.7)
which can be integrated to ﬁnd
u′=KΛ(ζ)/bracketleftBig
u+α(ζ,ζ)/bracketrightBig
, (2.8)
whereαis a suitably smooth function of ζand of its complex conjugate ζ. The trans-
formations (2.1) and (2.8) are related in such a way that they deﬁne the group of BMS
transformations
T(ζ) =fΛ(ζ) =(aζ+b)
(cζ+d), (2.9)
T(u) =KΛ(ζ)/bracketleftBig
u+α(ζ,ζ)/bracketrightBig
. (2.10)
In a concise form, one can write [16]
T(ζ,u) = (T(ζ),T(u)) =/parenleftBig
fΛ(ζ),KΛ(ζ)/bracketleftBig
u+α(ζ,ζ/bracketrightBig/parenrightBig
. (2.11)
As pointed out in Ref. [17], the transformations (2.9) can be classiﬁed according to their
ﬁxed points, for which f(ζ) =ζ. Hence only four families of fractional linear maps are
found to exist
4(i)Parabolic . Only one ﬁxed point exists, for which ( a+d)2= 4, while
Λ =AP=
±1β
0±1
, (2.12)
fΛ(ζ) =fP(ζ) =ζ±β. (2.13)
(ii)Elliptic. Two ﬁxed points exist, for which ( a+d)2<4, while
Λ =AE=
eiχ
20
0e−iχ

, (2.14)
fΛ(ζ) =fE(ζ) =eiχζ. (2.15)
(iii)Hyperbolic . Two ﬁxed points exist, for which ( a+d)2>4, while
Λ =AH=
/radicalbig
|κ|0
01√
|κ|
, (2.16)
fΛ(ζ) =fH(ζ) =|κ|ζ. (2.17)
(iv)Loxodromic . Two ﬁxed points exist, for which ( a+d)2∈C−R, and
(a+d) =√

√ρeiσ

, (2.18)
fΛ(ζ) =fL(ζ) =ρeiσζ. (2.19)
Note that our matrices (2.12), (2.14), (2.16) and (2.18) bel ong to SL(2 ,C), whereas in
section 2 of Ref. [17] only AP=MPwas in SL(2 ,C), whereas the matrices ME,MHand
MLtherein were elements of GL(2 ,C).
Since also the transformation T(u) depends on the matrix Λ through the conformal
factorKΛ(ζ), the work in Ref. [17] proposed the same nomenclature, from parabolic to
loxodromic, for the whole group of BMS transformations in Eq . (2.11). By virtue of Eqs.
5(2.6) and (2.12), (2.14), (2.16) and (2.18) one ﬁnds therefo re

(2.22) and (2.23) diﬀer by a multiplicative factor from the Eq s. in section 4 of Ref. [17]
because all our matrices are in SL(2 ,C).
3 A new theorem on supertranslations
At this stage, we can immediately prove the following theore m:
T1. A normal elliptic transformation, where the phase factor χin Eq. (2.15) is an integer
multiple of 2 π, engenders a BMS supertranslation.
Proof. Ifχ= 2πl,lbeing a relative integer, one ﬁnds the BMS transformation
T(ζ) =fE(ζ) =ζ,
which implies that
T(θ) =θ, T(φ) =φ, (3.1)
as well as (see Eqs. (2.10) and (2.21))
KE(ζ) = 1 =⇒T(u) =u+α(ζ,ζ). (3.2)
Equations (3.1) and (3.2) are precisely the deﬁning equatio ns of the Abelian subgroup of
supertranslations [16]. In other words, restriction to nor mal elliptic transformations, jointly
with a choice of the function α, engenders all supertranslations. Q.E.D.
As an explicit example, let us consider the most general metr ic in four dimensions in Bondi
6coordinates ( u,r,ζ,ζ):
g=−Udu⊗du−eβ(du⊗dr+dr⊗du)+gAB(dxA+1
2UAdu)⊗(dxB+1
2UBdu),(3.3)
wherexA= (ζ,ζ). The local diﬀeomorphism invariance is ﬁxed by the followin g conditions:
∂rdet/parenleftBiggAB
r2/parenrightBig
= 0, grr=grA= 0. (3.4)
In order to eliminate six Lorentz generators and thereby eli minating boosts and rotations
that grow with rat inﬁnity, we restrict ourselves to the diﬀeomorphisms gene rated by the
vector ﬁeld εwhose components have the large- rfalloﬀs:
(u)ε,(r)ε∼ O(r0),(ζ)ε,(ζ)ε∼ O(1
r). (3.5)
By deﬁnition, the asymptotic symmetries must preserve the f alloﬀ conditions:
guu=−1+2mB
r+O(r−2),
gur=−1+O(r−2),
guA=1
2DBCBA+O(r−1),
gAB=r2γAB+rCAB+O(r0), (3.6)
wheremBis known as the Bondi mass aspect and Cζζdescribes gravitational waves at large
r. Moreover, γABis the metric on the 2-sphere described by
γζζ=2
(1+ζζ)2. (3.7)
By using the falloﬀ conditions (3.5), one ﬁnds in Bondi gauge
(Lεg)rr= 2gur∂r(u)ε, (3.8)
which implies that(u)εmust be independent of r. In addition, to the leading order in the
asymptotic expansion
(Lεg)ur=gur∂u(u)ε+O(r−1). (3.9)
Hence,(u)ε(ζ,ζ) is a function on the 2-sphere which we ﬁx as being equal to α(ζ,ζ). Then,
7requiring that the Bondi conditions (3.4) and the falloﬀs (3. 6) are preserved implies that at
larger
ε=α(ζ,ζ)∂u+DζDζα(ζ,ζ)∂r−1
rDζα(ζ,ζ)∂ζ+c.c+..., (3.10)
whereα(ζ,ζ) can be any function of ( ζ,ζ) on the 2-sphere. The function α(ζ,ζ) can be
expanded in spherical harmonics on the 2-sphere. The modes l= 0 and l= 1 correspond
to the standard global translations in Minkowski space-tim e. The vector ﬁeld ε(α(ζ,ζ)) on
thel= 0 and l= 1 spherical harmonics can be evaluated as
ε(Y0
0) =Y0
0∂u,
ε(Ym
1) =Ym
1∂u+1
2D2Ym
1∂r−γAB∂BYm

with the following normalization for spherical harmonics:

1=ζ
(1+ζζ), Y0
1=(1−ζζ)
(1+ζζ), Y−1
1=ζ
(1+ζζ). (3.12)
Then the standard global translations in Minkowski space-t ime are deﬁned as
ε(Y0
0) =∂u,
ε(Y1
1) =ζ
(1+ζζ)(∂u−∂r)+ζ2
2r∂ζ−1

4 Behaviour of the conformal factor
The conformal factors (2.20), (2.22) and (2.23) have the lim iting behaviours
lim
|ζ|→0KP=1
(1+|β|2),lim
|ζ|→∞KP= 1, (4.1)

|ζ|→∞KH=1
|κ|, (4.2)
8lim
|ζ|→0KL=ρ,lim
|ζ|→∞=1
ρ. (4.3)
Moreover, since the independent variable x=|ζ|is always ≥0, bothKHandKLcan be
studied by considering the function
F:x∈[0,∞]→F(x) =ξ(1+x2)
(1+ξ2x2), (4.4)
whereξ=|κ|orξ=ρin the hyperbolic and loxodromic cases, respectively. Sinc e the ﬁrst
two derivatives of Fare given by
F′(x) =2ξ(1−ξ2)x
(1+ξ2x2)2, F′′(x) =2ξ(1−ξ2)
(1+ξ2x2)3(1−3ξ2x2), (4.5)
we ﬁnd that, if ξ∈]0,1[, the function Fis monotonically increasing ∀x∈[0,∞], displays
an upwards concavity and takes its absolute minimum at x= 0. The ﬁgure below plots the
graph of Fwhenξis either less than 1 or bigger than 1.

Figure 1: The conformal factor is monotonically increasing ifξ∈]0,1[ and monotonically
decreasing if ξ >1 in the hyperbolic and loxodromic cases.
In the parabolic case, the conformal factor given in Eq. (2.2 0) can be re-expressed in
the form
KP(ζ) =1+|ζ|2
/bracketleftBig
1+|β|2+/parenleftBig
1±2Re/parenleftBig
β
ζ/parenrightBig/parenrightBig
|ζ|2/bracketrightBig, (4.6)
and hence we cannot exploit the theory of functions of a real v ariable for the parabolic
conformal factor. The ﬁgure below plots the graph of the conf ormal factor KP(ζ) in the
(ζ,ζ) plane. Of course, using either Eq. (2.20) or Eq. (4.6) leads to the same plot ( KP+
andKP−are devoted to the plus-minus in the denominator of the confo rmal factor KP(ζ)).

105 Behaviour of Killing vector ﬁelds under BMS transforma-
tions
It is interesting to derive the most general form of the diﬀeom orphism associated with
the four branches of the BMS group. We look for a diﬀeomorphism ǫwhich satisﬁes the
asymptotic falloﬀ condition deﬁned in Eq. (3.5) together wi th the asymptotic symmetries
preservingthefalloﬀconditionsdescribedinEq. (3.6) inB ondigauge. Asalreadymentioned
in Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10), the group of BMS transformations is deﬁned as
T(ζ) =fΛ(ζ) =(aζ+b)
(cζ+d)
T(u) =KΛ(ζ)/bracketleftBig
u+α(ζ,ζ)/bracketrightBig
. (5.1)
We recall that the ﬁrst line of Eq. (5.1) can be always reduced to one of the forms (2.13),
(2.15), (2.17) or (2.19), where fΛ(ζ) reads eventually
fΛ(ζ) =Nγζ+γ.
Moreover, we consider the asymptotic expansion of the vecto r ﬁeldε
ε=(u)ε∂u+∞/summationdisplay
n=0(r)εn
rn∂r+∞/summationdisplay
n=1(ζ)εn
rn∂ζ+∞/summationdisplay
n=1(ζ)εn
rn∂ζ. (5.2)
The variation of the metric under a diﬀeomorphism is given by
(Lεg)µν=ερ∂ρgµν+gµρ∂νερ+gνρ∂µερ. (5.3)
In Bondi gauge,
(Lεg)rr= 2gur∂r(u)ε, (5.4)
which implies that(u)εmust be independent of r:
(u)ε=(u)ε(u,ζ,ζ). (5.5)
By using Eq. (2.7) together with the falloﬀ conditions for th e metric, the leading order in
the asymptotic expansion gives
(Lεg)ur=−∂u(u)ε=−(KΛ(ζ)−1), (5.6)
11where the last equality is obtained by evaluating the diﬀeren ce between the metric when du
is conformally rescaled according to (2.7) and the original metric with no rescaling of du.
Equation (5.6) suggests the following form for(u)ε
(u)ε=F(ζ,ζ)+u(KΛ(ζ)−1). (5.7)
From (Lεg)rζat order O(r0), one ﬁnds
(ζ)ε1=−NγDζ(u)ε. (5.8)
Moreover, ( Lεg)rζat order O(r−1) gives us
(ζ)ε2=Nγ
2CζζDζ(u)ε. (5.9)
The leading order of O(r) term of ( Lεg)uurequires
(r)ε0=G(ζ,ζ)+u
2(K2
Λ−1). (5.10)
The function G(ζ,ζ) can be deﬁned from the traceless nature of the O(r) term of ( Lεg)ζζ
as
(r)ε0=N2
γ
2D2(u)ε+u
2(K2
Λ−1). (5.11)
Thus, the Killing vector ﬁeld of the Bondi metric in correspo ndence with the four branches
of the BMS transformations reads as
ε=/parenleftbig
F(ζ,ζ)+u(KΛ(ζ)−1)/parenrightbig
∂u+/parenleftBigg

γ
2D2(u)ε+u

∂r
−1
r/parenleftbig
NγDζ(F(ζ,ζ)+u(KΛ(ζ)−1))/parenrightbig
∂ζ+c.c+... (5.12)
Hence four families of diﬀeomorphisms in correspondence wit h the BMS transformations
exist:
(i)Parabolic . In the case of a parabolic fractional linear map for ζ
KP(ζ) =1+|ζ|2
/parenleftBig
1+|±β+ζ|2/parenrightBig, (5.13)
Nγ=NP=±1, γ=γP=β. (5.14)
12(ii)Elliptic. For an elliptic fractional linear map,
KE(ζ) = 1, (5.15)
Nγ=NE= 1, γ=γE= 0. (5.16)
Therefore, the Killing vector ﬁeld (5.12) coincides with th e form obtained in Eq. (3.10).
(iii)Hyperbolic .
KH(ζ) =|κ|(1+|ζ|2)/parenleftBig
1+|κ|2|ζ|2/parenrightBig, (5.17)
Nγ=NH=|k|, γ=γH= 0. (5.18)
(iv)Loxodromic .
KL(ζ) =ρ(1+|ζ|2)/parenleftBig
1+ρ2|ζ|2/parenrightBig, (5.19)
Nγ=NL=ρeiσ, γ=γL= 0. (5.20)
Thus, the Killing vector ﬁelds associated with the four bran ches of the BMS transfor-
mations have been here derived for the ﬁrst time in the litera ture by substituting KΛ(ζ),
Nγandγfrom Eqs. (5.13)-(5.20) into Eq. (5.12).
6 BMS transformations in homogeneous coordinates
The material at the beginning of Appendix B suggests express ing our complex variable
ζ=eiφcotθ
2in the form ζ=z0
ζ1. This is easily accomplished by deﬁning
z0≡eiφ
2cosθ
2, z1≡e−iφ
2sinθ
2, (6.1)
and hence writing the ﬁrst half of BMS transformations, our E q. (2.1), in the form (B.1):

z′
0
z′
1
=
a b
c d

z0
z1
, (6.2)
where the SL(2 ,C) matrix can only be either (2.12), or (2.14), or (2.16), or (2 .18).
13The second half of BMS transformations, our Eq. (2.8), now re ads as
u′=KΛ(z0,z1)/bracketleftBig
u+α(z0,z1;¯z0,¯z1)/bracketrightBig
, (6.3)
where the conformal factor can only take one of the four forms (2.20)-(2.23), upon setting
ζ=z0
z1therein.
In Eqs. (6.2) and (6.3), the complex variables are deﬁned as i n (6.1) and obey therefore
the restrictions
|z0| ≤1,|z1| ≤1,
i.e. theycorrespondtoapairofunitcirclesΓ 0andΓ1. Thus,wemayrecognizethattheBMS
transformations are the restrictions to these circles of a m ore general set of transformations,
i.e. 
w′
1
w′
2
=
a b
c d

w1
w2
, (6.4)
u′=KΛ(w1,w2)/bracketleftBig
u+α(w1,w2; ¯w1,¯w2/bracketrightBig
, (6.5)
where both w1andw2belong to C∪{∞}, and they are such that
w1|Γ0=z0, w2|Γ1=z1.
Within this broader framework, one can consider two complex projective planes. Let Pbe
a point of the ﬁrst plane with coordinates ( w0,w1,w2), and let P′be a point of the second
plane, with coordinates ( u0,u1,u2). We can now take all nine products between a complex
coordinate of Pand a complex coordinate of P′, i.e.
Zhk=whuk, h,k= 0,1,2. (6.6)
These nine complex quantities are deﬁned up to a proportiona lity factor, since this is the
case for both whanduk. They can be therefore interpreted as the coordinates of a po int
Zof eight-dimensional complex projective space S8. To the pair of points PandP′there
corresponds a point ZofS8by means of Eq. (6.6). As PandP′are varying in their own
plane, the point Zdescribes in S8a four-complex-dimensional manifold, since both Pand
P′are varying on a plane, i.e. a two-complex-dimensional geom etric object. Equations
(6.6) represent therefore a four-complex-dimensional man ifoldV4in the complex projective
spaceS8. Such a manifold is the Segre manifold [25,26].
14If in the ﬁrst plane we ﬁx the point P= (w0,w1,w2), Eqs. (6.6) become linear homo-
geneous in the ukcoordinates and, as such, they represent a plane in S8. Thus, to every
point of the ﬁrst plane there corresponds a plane on the Segre manifold V4. The Segre
manifold contains therefore a complex double inﬁnitude of p lanes. In completely analogous
way, another double inﬁnitude of planes of V4corresponds to the double inﬁnitude of points
of the second plane. A plane of this second inﬁnitude is obtai ned by ﬁxing a point P′in the
second plane and then letting Pvary in the ﬁrst plane. Each of these ∞1systems of planes
is an array, in light of the correspondence between elements of the system and points of a
plane. Hence the Segre manifold contains two arrays of plane s. Two planes of the same
array do not have common points, whereas two planes belongin g to diﬀerent arrays have
one and only one common point [25].
One can also ﬁx the point Pand let the point P′vary not over the whole plane, but
only on a line in such a plane. In correspondence one obtains o n the Segre manifold V4aV1
subset, i.e. a curve. If both PandP′describe a line in their own plane, one obtains on the
Segre manifold V4aV2subset, i.e. a quadric. Hence to every pair of lines there cor responds
a quadric. Since there exist ∞2lines in a plane, the quadrics of a Segre manifold are ∞4.
In other words, the Segre manifold contains a complex fourfo ld inﬁnity of quadrics.
At a deeper level, we can say that the Segre manifold is the pro jective image of the
product of projective spaces, and it is a natural tool for stu dying the framework where
we can accommodate the transformations that reduce to the BM S transformations upon
restriction to the pair of unit circles Γ 0and Γ1.
7 Concluding remarks
Since asymptotic ﬂatness is a limiting case of classical gen eral relativity, in our opinion our
work is relevant for the scope of this special issue on Extrem e Regimes of Classical and
Quantum Gravity Models, bearing also in mind the relevance o f the BMS group for modern
studies of black holes [1,3,4]. Moreover, we possibly ﬁll a g ap in the literature, because we
have not found previous papers on the BMS group among those pu blished in Symmetry.
The original contributions of our paper are as follows.
(i) Proof that to each normal elliptic transformation of the complex variable ζused in the
metric for cuts of null inﬁnity there corresponds a BMS super translation. Although this
might be seen as a corollary of the work initiated in Ref. [17] , it has prepared the ground

15(ii) Study of the conformal factor in the BMS transformation of theuvariable as a function
of the squared modulus of ζ. In the loxodromic and hyperbolic cases, such a conformal
factor turns out to be either monotonically increasing or mo notonically decreasing as a
function of the real variable given by the absolute value of ζ. In the parabolic case, the
conformal factor is instead a real-valued function of compl ex variable, and one needs the
plots of Figure 2.
(iii) A classiﬁcation of Killing vector ﬁelds of the Bondi me tric has been obtained in Sec. 5.
(iv) In Sec. 6 we have found that BMS transformations are the r estriction to a pair of
unit circles of a more general set of transformations. Withi n this broader framework, the
geometry of such transformations is studied by means of its S egre manifold. This provides
an unforeseen bridge between the language of algebraic geom etry and the analysis of BMS
transformations in general relativity.
(v) Our remarks at the end of Sec. 5 might lead to a systematic a pplication of projective
geometry techniques for the deﬁnition of points at inﬁnity i n general relativity.
(vi) Our results in Sec. 5 suggest four sets of Killing ﬁelds a ssociated with the four branches
of BMS transformations. As discussed in Sec. 3, the elliptic transformations (the case with
KΛ(ζ) = 1) deﬁne the Abelian subgroup of supertranslations. The l inearized action of
supertranslations in the Schwarzschild case is already stu ded in [3] which results in a black
hole with linearized supertranslation hair. It would be int eresting to study the action of
parabolic, hyperbolic and loxodromic transformations deﬁ ned by the Killing ﬁelds (5.12) on
a black hole metric.
To sum up, we have addressed the physical problem of obtainin g a more complete
understanding of BMS diﬀeomorphisms of an asymptotically ﬂa t spacetime. The tools we
have developed might therefore lead to new developments in b lack hole physics (see item
(vi) above) and in the area of geometric methods in theories o f gravity, especially in light
of the original framework described in Sec. 6.
Appendix A: composition of BMS transformations
It is helpful to derive, with the notation in our section 2, th e composition rule of two
16BMS transformations. For this purpose we note that, since a B MS transformation yields
T(ζ,u) = (ζ′,u′) = (T(ζ),T(u)), (A.1)
where
ζ′=T(ζ) =(aζ+b)
(cζ+d)=fΛ(ζ), (A.2)
u′=T(u) =KΛ(ζ)/bracketleftBig
u+α(ζ,ζ)/bracketrightBig
, (A.3)
the subsequent BMS map leads to
T(ζ′,u′) = (ζ′′,u′′) = (T(ζ′),T(u′)), (A.4)
where, by virtue of Eq. (A2), one obtains
ζ′′=T(ζ′) =(a′ζ′+b′)
(c′ζ′+d′)=fΛ′(ζ′)
=(a′a+b′c)ζ+(a′b+b′d)
(c′a+d′c)ζ+(c′b+d′d)=(Aζ+B)
(Cζ+D)=fΛ′′(ζ), (A.5)
having deﬁned
Λ′′=
A B
C D
= Λ′Λ, (A.6)
which is the product of the PSL(2 ,C) matrices
Λ′=
a′b′
c′d′
,Λ =
a b
c d
.
Moreover, one ﬁnds
u′′=T(u′) =KΛ′(ζ′)/bracketleftBig
u′+α(ζ′,ζ′)/bracketrightBig

u+/tildewideα(ζ,ζ)/bracketrightBig

17Appendix B: Origin and properties of fractional linear maps
Suppose that the pair of complex coordinates ( z0,z1) are mapped into the pair ( z′
0,z′
1)
by the linear transformation

z′
0
z′
1
=
a b
c d

z0
z1
, ad−bc/ne}ationslash= 0. (B.1)
This means that the ratio ζ=z0
z1is mapped into
ζ′=z′
0
z′
1=(az0+bz1)
(cz0+dz1)=(aζ+b)
(cζ+d). (B.2)
Thus, a fractional linear map arises from a linear transform ation acting on the homogeneous
coordinates z0,z1. For further insight, we refer the reader to the lecture note s in Ref. [27].
If the matrix on the right-hand side of Eq. (B1) pertains to PS L(2,C), the condition of
unit determinant yields
b=(ad−1)
c, (B.3)
and hence one ﬁnds [28]
ζ′=(aζ+b)
(cζ+d)=a
c(cζ+d)−1
c
(cζ+d)=a
c−1
|c|2/parenleftbigg|c|
c/parenrightbigg21/parenleftbig
ζ+d
c/parenrightbig. (B.4)
Thus, half of the BMS transformations as in Eq. (A2) arise by c omposition of the following
maps [28]:
Translation ζ→ζ+d
c, (B.5)
Inversion ζ+d
c→1/parenleftbig
ζ+d
c/parenrightbig, (B.6)
Rotation ζ→ −/parenleftbigg|c|
c/parenrightbigg2
z, (B.7)
Dilation ζ→1
|c|2ζ, (B.8)
and eventually a further translation
ζ→ζ+a
c. (B.9)
18The interplay of homogeneous and non-homogeneous coordina tes has not been fully
exploited in general relativity so far, to the best of our kno wledge. For example, linear
transformations among real homogeneous coordinates may be a powerful tool for studying
points at inﬁnity. In particular, one could imagine that the coordinates x1,x2,x3,x4used
for a real four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime manifold arise from ﬁve homogeneous
coordinates ( y0,y1,y2,y3,y4) according to the rule
x1=y1
y0, x2=y2
y0, x3=y3
y0, x4=y4
y0, (B.10)
they’s being subject to the linear transformations
y′µ=4/summationdisplay
ν=0Aµ
νyν,det(Aµ
ν)/ne}ationslash= 0, (B.11)
which imply the following transformation rules for spaceti me coordinates:
x′µ=/summationtext4
λ=0Aµ
λyλ
/summationtext4
ν=0A0νyν∀µ= 1,2,3,4. (B.12)
The equations (B12) might provide a fully projective way of s tudying the concept of inﬁnity
(cf. Ref. [29]).
