1 Introduction
Realizable complex quantum systems are always sub-
ject to decoherence. Research over the last decades
has led to the independent development of the the-
ory of quantum chaos in isolation from environmen-
tal effects, [1, 2], and that of open quantum systems
[3, 4]. Nevertheless, a common framework for their
understandingwithoutrelyingonsemi-classicalmeth-
ods [5], a theory of open quantum chaos, is yet to be
developed.
Decoherence plays a crucial role in the emergence
of classical-like chaotic behavior in quantum systems,
such as phase-space islands and divergent trajecto-
ries governed by a positive Lyapunov exponent [6–
9]. Nonetheless, as the notion of chaos in quantum
mechanics evolved, the spectral characterization of
the system’s Hamiltonian became the primary focus
[10, 11, 2]. The Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture
uncovered a relation between the distribution of en-
ergy levels in quantum analogs of classically chaotic
systems and Random Matrix Theory (RMT) [11], al-
lowingtheuseofsimplediagnostictools, suchaslevel-
spacing distributions, for the heuristic classification
of quantum chaotic systems, without reference to the
semi-classical limit. Soon, the application of Fourier
methods shifted the identification of signatures of
quantum chaos from the energy to the time domain[12–15]. Notably, the analysis of the SFF revealed
the importance of a “correlation hole”, reflecting the
effect of level repulsion. The SFF is closely related
to the survival probability, the Loschmidt echo [16],
quantum work statistics [17], frame potentials and t-
designs [18, 19], the partition function with complex
temperature [20–22], and the full-counting statistics
of the Hamiltonian [23]. The recognition of the role of
statistical correlations associated with quantum chaos
has motivated additional proposals for diagnostics di-
rectly related to entanglement [24–31] and quantum
discord [32]. In this context, coherence in the energy
eigenbasis is an essential ingredient of quantum chaos
[33].
The unitarity of the dynamical maps generated by
Hermitian Hamiltonians preserves the inner product
between two arbitrarily close states. Consequently,
quantum irregular motion cannot be characterized by
adirectanalogoftheLyapunovexponentoranyother
measure of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
An intuitive alternative is the study of the sensitivity
of the evolution to slight changes in the dynamical
parameters, i.e., the Hamiltonian itself, quantified by
the Loschmidt echo [16]. More recently, the fidelity
susceptibility [34, 35] has attracted considerable at-
tention as a measure of eigenstate sensitivity to de-
formations. Out-of-Time-Order Correlators (OTOC)
[36–38] are promising candidates for the link between
the phenomenology of eigenstate thermalization [39–
44], quantum information scrambling [45–48] and op-
erator growth [49, 50]. Lately, efforts have targeted
the direct generalization of OTOC to study the fate of
these effects in open systems [51–53]. Each measure

havior [54].
In isolated systems, the Hermiticity of the Hamilto-
nian guarantees a set of real eigenvalues whose spac-
ing distributions can exhibit level repulsion. In close
analogy, an approach to open quantum chaos relies
on characterizing the spectrum of Liouvillians and
quantum channels. Nevertheless, one cannot uniquely
order the differences between their eigenvalues since
they are complex numbers, in general. Therefore,
the comparison of the corresponding distributions re-
quires extra assumptions. Such static signatures are
pursued on different fronts, including the radial repul-

value distributions [56–59], complex spacing ratios
[60], and symmetry classification [61–65]. While some
of the above studies preserve the simplicity and ele-
gance of the Hermitian setting, they are less suited
for quantifying the interplay between quantum chaos
and decoherence, on which we focus.
A complementary approach we pursue in this arti-
cle relies on the generalization of the notion of SFF
in an information-theoretic interpretation, i.e., as the
Uhlmann fidelity [66] between an initial state – the
thermofield double or a coherent Gibbs state – and
the time-evolving state, with no restrictions on the
underlying dynamics [67–70]. This generalization of
the SFF to open systems differs from alternative pro-
posals focused on the spectral properties of the gener-
ator of the dynamics [71–73]. Within this approach,
decoherence generally suppresses the dynamical sig-
natures of Hamiltonian quantum chaos. Namely, with
the increase of dissipation, the depth and area of the
correlation hole shrink, and the span of the ramp de-
creases [67–69, 74, 70]. This feature is also present in
generalizations of the SFF based on the characteristic
function of the local energy distribution in multipar-
tite systems [23]. An interesting counterexample to
this generic observation is that of balanced norm gain
and loss in ED processes, where the duration of the
linear ramp before the plateau is extended and the
depth and area of the correlation hole can increase
with finite dissipation [69, 70].
In such context, relating coherence quantifiers to
signatures of quantum chaos is an intricate task. The
comparison of coherence quantifiers, such as coher-
ence monotones, the l2-norm of coherence [75], and
the coherence-generating power [76–78], presents its
own set of challenges. Different coherence quantifiers
often share qualitative similarities and can sometimes
be bounded by one another. The authors of [79] have
used quantifiers of coherence to diagnose quantum
chaos in isolated dynamics; however, such quantifiers
were not coherence monotones. In this work, we seek
to investigate how signatures of quantum chaos re-
lated to spectral statistics are altered when the evolu-
tion becomes nonunitary. In particular, we focus on
the relation of the SFF to a coherence monotone, the
l1-norm of coherence.

herence by studying the survival probability, the pu-
rity, and the l1-norm of coherence of an initial CGS.
At this level, the connection to the SFF becomes ex-
plicit. This analysis reveals how the decay of the den-
sitymatrix’soff-diagonalelementsintheenergyeigen-
basis directly suppresses the manifestation of level re-
pulsion in the correlation hole. Such a line of thought
links quantum chaos in open systems to the resource
theory of coherence [75, 80–82]. We note that the lat-
ter has recently motivated the use of coherence quan-tifiers as diagnostic tools for quantum chaos [79].
To illustrate the generality of our approach, after
discussing the case of ED dynamics, we introduce
PQC, a family of mixed quantum operations whose
consecutive application results in principle in non-
Markovian quantum dynamics [83, 84]. Specifically,
by splitting the dynamical map into two weighted
channels, we introduce dissipation through the recur-
ring effect of a set of Kraus-Choi operators on the
isolated dynamics generated by a Hamiltonian. This
model is of interest as a paradigm of mixed Com-
pletely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) oper-
ations involving a fixed fundamental period of inter-
action with a reservoir. So as to quantify the inter-
play between quantum chaos and decoherence, we an-
alyze the spectral signatures and the correlation hole
in the SFF for varying values of the control parame-
ters, sampling the constituent matrices of the channel
from random matrix ensembles.
The paper is structured as follows. Sec. 2 intro-
duces the fidelity-based definition of the SFF as a rel-
evant extension of the notion to open systems. Sec. 3
reviews the definitions of the purity and the most rel-
evant coherence monotones of the CGS, relating them
to the SFF. Sec. 4 addresses the case of decoherence
in the energy eigenbasis when the Hamiltonian and
the dissipator commute. Sec. 5 discusses the proper-
ties of random PQC.
2 Spectral Form Factor for Open
Quantum Systems
The survival probability of a quantum state evolving
under unitary dynamics carries information about the
structure of the energy levels and their correlations.
It equals the fidelity between a pure initial and the
time-evolving state, while its Fourier transform is a
weighted sum of Dirac δ-functions positioned at the
Hamiltonian eigenvalues.
The role of a so-called correlation hole, in the sur-
vival probability and its connection to level statistics
have appeared early on in the literature [12, 85, 13–
15]. The correlation hole is a dip below the saturation
value, followed by a linear ramp that concludes at the
time when the smallest dynamical frequencies have
been expressed. The depth of the correlation hole is
a measure of eigenvalue repulsion, typical of Hamilto-
nian quantum chaos, which could be carried over into
dissipative systems.

For isolated dynamics, the SFF coincides with the fi-
delity between an initial CGS and its time evolution

.(2)
The generalization of the above definition for open
quantum systems has been put forward in [68] and
further studied in [69, 70, 73]. These results indi-
cate that decoherence generally suppresses the depth
and area of the correlation hole. Nevertheless, the
time duration of the ramp can be extended when the
quantum jumps are neglected [69, 70]. Here, we fo-
cus on the dynamics generated by a CPTP operation.
In general, given an arbitrary CPTP quantum chan-
nelΦt, depending on a discrete or continuous time
parametert, the fidelity-based SFF reads [68],
SFFβ(t) =⟨Ψβ|ρβ(t)|Ψβ⟩, (3)
withρβ(t) =Φt[|Ψβ⟩⟨Ψβ|]. Wenotethatthisisequiv-

tion involving a Hamiltonian, such as circuit models,

necessary for the above definition, which is reduced

culations in this article will mainly refer to the infinite
temperature CGS. In Sec. 4, the quantum channel
will be generated by a Linbladian having as only dis-
sipator the system Hamiltonian itself, while in Sec. 5,
we construct a heuristic discrete-time CPTP map in
which unitary evolution is mixed with arbitrary phys-
ical processes.
In what follows, we will often adopt a specific ma-
trix representation of all superoperators for the intu-
itive simplification of their spectral properties, often
referred to as the Liouville space formalism [87]. In
particular, we consider the horizontal vectorization of
any density matrix

representation, the choice of basis is fixed, and any
further transformation of a superoperator has to be
treated consistently. The horizontal decomposition

3 Coherence Monotones and Quan-
tum Chaos
Dephasing is a form of decoherence that suppresses
the density matrix’s off-diagonal entries in a given ba-
sis. When examining thermalization and quantum er-
godicity, the diagonal ensemble motivates the Hamil-
tonian eigenbasis as the most relevant for the study
of decoherence. In the energy eigenbasis, coherence
quantifiers can capture how localized or uniformly
spread a quantum state is, i.e., they serve as delo-
calization measures [79].
The CGS and the closely related thermofield dou-
ble state are natural probe states for quantum chaos.
They are coherent quantum states with support in
the whole energy spectrum and a tunable filter (the
square root of the Boltzmann weights), preferentially
sampling low-energy states at finite inverse temper-
atureβ > 0. Furthermore, in the resource theory
of quantum coherence, the infinite temperature CGS,
β= 0, is a maximally coherent state, saturating the
value of any well-defined coherence monotone. In this
context, any quantum state can be prepared from the
infinite temperature CGS, using only incoherent op-
erations [88, 89, 75].
Motivated by the central role of the CGS in the
study of quantum chaos and resource theory of co-
herence, we propose the known coherence monotones
Accepted in Quantum2024-08-07, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 3of its time evolution as relevant diagnostic tools for
the interplay between the two. We introduce a rela-
tion between the SFF and the l1-norm of coherence,
suggesting the study of other relevant signatures of
quantum chaos or coherence monotones for future in-
vestigations.
Thel1-norm of coherence is a coherence monotone
[88], defined as

n,m=1
n<m|ρnm(t)|. (8)
The purity of a density matrix, P= Tr/bracketleftbig

n,m=1
n<m|ρnm(t)|2. (9)
By observing that 0≤|ρnm(t)|≤1, for alln,m =
{1,2,...,d}, one can directly relate the two through
the inequality
P(t)≤d/summationdisplay
n=1|ρnn(t)|2+Cl1(t). (10)
We note that the first term on the right-hand side of
the last inequality can be associated with the inverse
participation ratio of the initial state in the computa-
tional basis, which can serve as a measure of delocal-
ization. Further, it equals the purity the decohered

we will study the properties of purity and the l1-norm
of coherence and their relation to fidelity when the
initial state is the CGS.
At infinite temperature, β= 0, the SFF is bound
by thel1-norm of coherence of the CGS through
1−Cl1(t)
d≤SFF(t)≤1 +Cl1(t)
d. (11)
For a detailed proof, please see appendix E. The
above bound helps to understand the extent and
timescales at which quantum fluctuations are sup-
pressedbydecoherence, distinguishingthiseffectfrom
their reduction due to ensemble averaging. We note
that the authors of Ref. [79] relate the SFF to the
coherence-generating power [76–78] averaged over the
Gaussian unitary ensemble through an analytical up-
per bound. Nevertheless, the coherence-generating
power is a property that describes a quantum opera-
tion and its ability to generate coherence from inco-
herent states, rather than describing the states them-
selves. We do not address the possibility of deriving
inequalities similar to (11), with different coherence
monotones and measures, such as the relative entropy
of coherence [75].4 Energy Dephasing
The time-continuous description of dephasing in the
energy eigenbasis is a natural model of decoherence
known as ED. It arises in scenarios involving timing
of the quantum unitary dynamics with noisy clocks
[90], the theory of fluctuating Hamiltonians [91], time
coarse-graining, continuous measurement of energy,
and stochastic modifications of quantum mechanics
[92–95], to name some relevant examples. Due to its
simplicity, it is amenable to analytical description and
has been used in open quantum chaos and black hole
physics [22, 21, 68–70]. The ED dynamics is governed
by the equation
∂tρ(t) =−i
ℏ[H,ρ(t)]−γ[H,[H,ρ(t)]], (12)
withdephasingstrength γ. Thegeneralsolutionreads
ρ(t) =d/summationdisplay

m<npnpme−γt(En−Em)2cos/parenleftbiggEn−Em

,
whereFp=Z(2β)/Z2(β)is the value of the plateau
reached after the Heisenberg time. Accordingly, the
Cl1of the CGS under dephasing is
Cl1,β(t) = 2/summationdisplay
m<n√pnpme−γt(En−Em)2, (15)
while the corresponding purity reads
Pβ(t) =Fp+ 2/summationdisplay
m<npnpme−2γt(En−Em)2. (16)
We note that the SFF and purity of the CGS sat-
urate at the same plateau, Fp, while the l1-norm of
coherence goes to zero. The reason is the following.
Incoherent states are always diagonal in the reference
basis,ρ=/summationtextd
n=1rn|n⟩⟨n|, with probabilities rn[75].
Here, the reference basis is the energy eigenbasis, and
the dissipative part of Eq. (12)commutes with the
Hamiltonian; consequently, coherence can never be
generated. We note that ED is a maximally inco-
herent and translationally-invariant operation in the
sense of [75], mapping all incoherent states into inco-
herent states while asymptotically consuming all co-
herence of an initial coherent state such as the CGS.
In isolation ( γ= 0), the Heisenberg time is defined
astH= 2πℏ/∆, with ∆being the mean level spac-
ing of the Hamiltonian H. It determines the onset of
the plateau of the SFF and sets a limit to the dura-
tion of any control protocol of quantum information.

quantum chaotic systems, characterized by a dip below the
saturation value, followed by a linear ramp, and concluding
with a plateau. The SFF is bounded by the l1-norm of co-
herence of the CGS, from above by the general Eq. (11)and
from below by Eq. (19)when ED (14)is considered. Here,
we show the corresponding numerical ED calculation for a
single GOE(64) ,σ= 1Hamiltonian, increasing the dephas-
ingstrengthfrom γ= 0.1inpanel atoγ= 4inpanel b. The
bounds become tight under strong ED when the correlation
hole is suppressed but are weak otherwise.
After this timescale, all incommensurable frequencies
governing the dynamical evolution of a complex quan-
tumsystemhavebeenexpressedonaverage, canceling
each other effectively, regardless of their contribution
to the initial state. In Fig. 1, we see that the on-
set and value of the plateau remain unchanged under
ED dynamics. See also Fig. 11 in appendix C for a
comparison of different γ. By contrast, the minimum
of the correlation hole, associated with the Thouless
time [96], is delayed.
For the purity and the l1-norm of coherence of a
CGS, we see from Eq. (10)that
Pβ(t)≤Fp+Cl1,β(t). (17)
At infinite temperature, β= 0, one can make a Taylor
expansion of the cosine in Eq. (14)and relate the SFF
andthederivativesof Cl1withrespectto γoftheCGS
through the equation

. (19)
The above, together with Eq. (11), bound the fluc-
tuations of the SFF around the plateau at large
timescales. Said differently, the volume of the "quan-
tum noise" [97] in the SFF is bound by the derivative
of thel1-norm of coherence of the CGS.
In Fig. 1, we sample the Hamiltonian matrix from
GOE(d), whose eigenvalue probability density func-tion is the semicircle law

The increase of the dephasing strength γgives rise
to the gradual loss of the correlation hole [68]. The

the coherence monotone Cl1are weak in the presence
of quantum coherences in the energy eigenbasis when
the dynamical signatures of quantum chaos are man-
ifest and become tighter as the dephasing strength is

5 Parametric Quantum Channels
Intheprevioussections,weexaminedthequantitative
relation between the SFF and the l1-norm of coher-
ence of an initial CGS. As a first example, we per-
formed numerical calculations for the maximally in-
coherent operation of ED. In this section, we define a
non-Markovian model describing a binary mixture of
quantum channels; one unitary, the other generic.
Let us consider the convex subspace of a Hilbert-
Schmidt spaceD(H), containing all unit-trace, Her-
mitian and positive semi-definite density matrices ρ∈
D(H), acting on a Hilbert space, H⊆ Cdof finite di-
mensiond∈N. Extending the 1-parameter model
[58], we introduce the operator-sum representation of
the PQC onD(H)through

with the parameters ϵ∈[0,1],τ∈R, andK∈
{1,2,...,d2−2}. This 2-parameter family of CPTP
maps can be thought of as a prototype of unitary
temporal evolution, mixed with the effects of mea-
surements [98] or transient interactions with an en-
vironment [99]. We define the dissipation strength ϵ
to be a small parameter that weights the non-unitary
part of the channel, comprising arbitrary environmen-
tal degrees of freedom by the action of the Kraus-Choi
operatorsNr∈HS

cific angle on the complex plane. As we will shortly
see, whenever τ≪ℏ/ϵ, its inverse 1/τcan effectively
approximate the frequency with which an effect in-
terrupts the unitary evolution with a dissipative kick
of strength ϵ. Thus, a relative timescale and a corre-
sponding energy scale ℏ/τare set, indicating how fast
the internal degrees of freedom change compared to
the accessible environmental processes.

The generated discrete-time dynamics can provide a
heuristic approach to a class of physical phenomena
by the introduction of a time parameter t=jτ, gener-
ally irreproducible by a continuous master equation,
˙ρ(t) =Lρ(t), withLbeing in the Lindblad form
[100, 101]. In particular, if the channel Λτ,ϵis non-
divisible, then the corresponding quantum evolution
is non-Markovian [83, 102]. Nevertheless, whenever
the channel Λτ,ϵsatisfies necessary and sufficient con-
ditions for the quantum process it describes to be
Markovian [103, 104], the evolution of Eq. (25)can,
in principle, be represented by a master equation of
Lindblad form [3, 4].
Indeed, in the limit of very small dissipation
strength and large dissipation period, we can define
ϵ= 2γτand the difference

In this limit, the Kraus-Choi operators become the
Lindblad operators. As a remark, weak but frequent
interactions with the environment can result in large
γ. Moreover, the ED model discussed in Sec. 4 can be
derived from the PQC, choosing the system Hamilto-
nian as the single Kraus-Choi operator N1=H. The
master equation (12) results from PQC in the contin-
uum limit τ→0keepingγ=ϵ/(2τ)constant.
In the model of Eq. (22), the fidelity between the

the PQC is

or equivalently, in the vectorized notation

We note that the discrete evolution of Eq. (25)has
a unique steady state whose eigenvalue distribution
determines the asymptotic value of the purity at long
timesP(t→∞ ). The PQC evolution can effectively
result from a unitary quantum evolution that is pe-
riodically interrupted by the action of a dissipative
quantum channel. Specifically, let us consider the se-
quential application of a unitary
Uτ=eiτ
ℏ( 1⊗H⊺−H⊗ 1), (31)

as shown in Fig. 2. The channel of Eq. (32)can
be interpreted as a weak instantaneous perturbation
from the environment for small ϵ. The time evolution
at every step is described by

The channels Λτ,ϵof Eq. (24)andWϵUτdiffer in the
unitary Uτmultiplying the dissipative part. When all
constituent matrices are sampled randomly, this plays
a minor role in the spectral properties of the overall
channel. More generally, Eq. (24)is a good approx-
imation of Eq. (34)ifϵτ≪ℏ, as seen by truncating
the Taylor expansion of the exponential multiplying
its dissipative part.

The spectral signatures of complex Hamiltonian sys-
tems, carrying all information needed for the descrip-
tion of the evolution of an isolated system, have
served for almost four decades as an archetype of
quantum chaos [10, 11, 2, 1]. Consequently, the
classification of self-adjoint and unitary ensembles
has been a priority of mathematical physicists in
the previous century. In parallel, a concrete the-
ory of open quantum systems has been developed
[100, 101, 99, 3, 4], shifting the attention to the over-
all dynamical maps governing the temporal evolution
of a subsystem. In the Lindbladian decomposition of
the generators of such dynamical maps, the Hamil-
tonian operator becomes an element of a set of not-
necessarily-Hermitian operators determining the dy-
namics. From an information-theoretic perspective, a
dynamical map is a completely positive superopera-
tor mapping quantum states to quantum states. The
PQC introduced in Eq. (22)allows the explicit inclu-
sion of a quantum chaotic Hamiltonian in the later
picture while incorporating the decohering action of
arbitrary environmental effects.
We next perform a series of random matrix calcu-
lations to unveil and quantify the behavior of various
signatures of Hamiltonian quantum chaos in the pres-
ence of decoherence. The first part of the PQC of
Eq. (22)encodes the standard paradigm of Hamilto-
nian quantum chaos [2, 105], while the second part
is taken as a composition of random Kraus-Choi op-
erators, the weight of which represents the strength
of the interaction with the environment. Specifically,
we sample the Hamiltonian matrix Hfrom the Gaus-
sian orthogonal ensemble, GOE(d)and construct the
restKKraus-Choi operators Nras block-truncations
of an enlarged random CUE(Kd)element as follows
[106–109, 58]. Let V∈CKd×Kdbe a unitary, imply-

5.3 Spectral Phases
There is a growing interest in the classification of the
spectral properties of random non-Hermitian Hamil-
tonian operators [110–113], random Liouvillian oper-
ators [59, 114], random Lindblandian operators [115–
118, 65] and random Kraus maps [58, 109]. We ded-
icate this subsection to the characterization of the
spectralphasediagramofrandomPQC,providingan-
alytic estimations of the spectral loci as functions of
the dissipation parameters.

the complex plane (blue to red) of 16384eigenvalues of the
superoperator defined in Eq. (24), together with the theoret-
ical boundaries (black dashed lines). Each panel was gener-
ated by 4independent realizations, with the Hamiltonian H
sampled from GOE(64) ,σ= 1, setting ℏ= 1and a set of
K= 3random Kraus-Choi matrices Nr, drawn as trunca-
tions of an enlarged random CUE(192) element. a.Shifted-

Eq.(38).b.Disk phase: the boundary of the spectral locus

d.Annular phase: the boundaries of the spectral locus are

Letλ∈Cbe the solutions to the eigenvalue prob-
lemΛτ,ϵ|λ) =λ|λ).The eigenvalue λ= 1is always
a solution corresponding to the stationary point of
Λτ,ϵ. We refer to the rest of the spectrum as the spec-
tral bulk. The boundaries of the spectral bulk can be
categorized into four main classes, as shown in the nu-
mericalexamplesofFig. 3andthequalitativespectral
phase diagram of Fig. 4. Specifically, for large values
of the dissipation period τ>τcthere are two possible
spectral phases referred to as "annular" and "disk",
a fact known in the literature as the single ring theo-
rem [119–126, 109]. When a dissipation strength ϵis
introduced,aphasecrossovertakesplace[58]. Thede-
crease of the period τbreaks the rotational invariance
of the superoperator spectrum, eventually suppress-
ing its bulk within a "shifted disk". The crossover
from an annulus to a shifted disk happens through an
extended "crescent" transitive area.
In the annular phase of Fig. 3 d, the spectrum is
bounded by the two concentric circles

whose radii can be estimated through a quaternionic

For large dissipation periods, the annulus-to-disk

i.e., when the argument of the square root of the in-
nerconcentriccircleinEq. (35)becomesnegative[58],
turning the corresponding radius into a purely imag-
inary number. We refer the reader to appendix A for
more details.

pation periods confine the spectral bulk within the

Eq. (22)limits the angular distribution of the spec-
trum on the complex plane by a ϕmax=τmax{Em−

The crossover from an annulus or a disk to a shifted
disk roughly starts when all eigenvalues are confined
in angles less than 2π, determining the critical dis-
sipation period τc=πℏ/(σ√
2d), which is related to
the Heisenberg time of the ED models (21)through
tH= (d−1)τc. (40)

ever disordered averages are considered, given that
the dimension of the Hilbert space is finite and the
spectrum of the Hamiltonian is bounded.

ing when the imaginary part of all bulk eigenvalues
becomes less than the radius of the shifted disk

the correlation hole and the corresponding decay of the CGS

responding sets of K= 3random Kraus-Choi matrices Nr

Accepted in Quantum2024-08-07, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 85.4 Correlation Hole
The existence of a correlation hole in the structure
of an auto-correlation function, such as the SFF of
Eq. (3), is a signature of the underlying complexity,
reflecting the level of commensurability between the
frequencies associated with the dynamics [12–16, 29].
In the energy eigenbasis of a subsystem, the con-
tribution of these frequencies to the time evolution
is weighted by the size of the corresponding coher-
ences of the density matrix, i.e., by the size of its off-
diagonal elements. Said differently, starting from an
initiallycoherentstate(asdefinedbytheresourcethe-
ory of coherence [75]), the relative phases of the prob-
ability amplitudes of the energy eigenstates vanish as
the state becomes incoherent. The suppression of co-
herences due to the dynamical map’s non-unitarity is
thus expected to suppress the correlation hole’s size.
In Sec. 4, we illustrated the mechanism underlying
the dynamical suppression of the correlation hole in
the paradigmatic case of ED, interpreting the results
of [68–70] through the resource theory of coherence
[75]. There, the maximally incoherent operation of
the ED channel turns the maximally coherent CGS
at infinite temperature asymptotically into an inco-
herent one. The random PQC is incoherent but not
necessarily maximally incoherent. Thus, the l1-norm
of coherence does not saturate asymptotically to zero.
This results in loosening the bounds of Eq. (11)when
we increase the dissipation strength or decrease the
dissipation period, while the saturation time of the
SFF and the l1-norm of coherence is shifted to the left
oftHbefore the correlation hole closes. In Fig. 5, we
show the corresponding shrinking of the correlation
hole with the increment of the dissipation strength or
the decrement of the dissipation period for random
PQC.
We define the effective depth of the correlation hole
Deff=/radicaltp/radicalvertex/radicalvertex/radicalbtlnjH/productdisplay
j=jThFp
SFF(jτ). (42)
The time steps of the Thouless and Heisenberg times
are defined through the ceiling functions jTh=
⌈tTh/τ⌉,jH=⌈tH/τ⌉. The relative effective depth
can be defined as the effective depth normalized by
the corresponding value for the isolated dynamics. In
Fig. 6, we show the relative effective depth of the
correlation hole in the plane of the PQC parameters.
See also Fig. 12 in appendix C for an illustration of
the SFF with specific choices of the PQC parameters.
5.5 Complex Spacing Ratios
In isolated dynamics, the relation between the static
signatures of quantum chaos and the corresponding
dynamical ones has been explored. In particular, the
rigidity of the Hamiltonian spectrum has been related
to the existence of a linear ramp in the correlation

color scheme and scaling are the same as that of Fig. 3 and

ration to the plateau at tH. However, the spectrum of
the generators of open quantum dynamics or the cor-
responding dynamical maps is, in principle, spread
around the complex plane. Hence, the generalization
of signatures involving level spacing distributions is
not straightforward. One possibility introduced in
[60] is the following. Given an eigenvalue λofΛτ,ϵ
on the complex plane, one can find the nearest, λNN
and next nearest, λNNNneighboring eigenvalues re-
spectively, and thus define the complex spacing ratio
z= (λNN−λ)/(λNNN−λ).
As we saw in the previous sections, the shrinking
of the correlation hole of the SFF is a purely dynam-
ical effect linked to the behavior of the corresponding
coherence monotones of the CGS. Static signatures of
open quantum chaos, such as complex spacing ratios,
do not necessarily diagnose the long-time behavior of
the coherences in a direct way. In Fig. 7, we show the
density plots of the complex spacing ratios for PQC
parameters corresponding to the four spectral phases
of Fig. 3. We see that the angular and the radial re-
pulsion persist in all parameter areas, even where the
correlation whole has vanished.
6 Summary
Known signatures of quantum chaos, coherence, and
Markovianity are measures of quantum correlations.
Based on this observation, our work proposes an
information-theoretic framework to explore the inter-
play between environmental noise and complexity in
quantum systems. By relating the survival probabil-
ity of an initial CGS to the associated l1-norm of co-
herence, we account for complex dissipative and not-
necessarily-Markovian quantum effects. The mani-
festations of correlations between energy eigenvalues
associated with quantum chaos, which result in the
correlation hole of the SFF, are suppressed by non-
unitary dynamics during the time evolution. This
suppression is a direct consequence of the loss of co-
herence in the energy eigenbasis, measured by the dif-
ferent coherence monotones. Nevertheless, such dy-
namical phenomena are hard to capture by the pro-
posed static spectral signatures of dissipative quan-
tum chaos. We work on paradigmatic examples of
maximally incoherent Lindbladian dynamics and a
discrete-time model of CPTP maps involving a uni-
tary generated by a Hamiltonian. The latter is inter-
esting in its own right. We have thus discussed its
spectral properties, sampling the constituting opera-
tions by random matrix ensembles.
Our work provides a natural and tractable frame-
work to explore the interplay between environmen-
tal noise, resource theories and complexity in scalable
quantum systems. This quest is of particular impor-
tance for the transition from the NISQ era in quan-
tum technologies [127]. Finally, our work contributesto understanding the emergence of classical behavior
from the quantum substrate, e.g., the quantum-to-
classical transition [8]. In particular, we have shown
that signatures of Hamiltonian quantum chaos rely
on the presence of quantum coherence and are thus
suppressed by dephasing mechanisms stemming from
decoherence. These findings are complementary to
the pioneering works exploring the interplay of quan-
tum chaos and decoherence that relied on the latter
for the emergence of classical chaos [6–9].

A Annulus-to-Disk Crossover
ThecircularlawisafundamentalresultofRMT,stat-
ing that the distribution of eigenvalues of square ran-
dom matrices, with independent and identically dis-
tributed complex entries, in the limit of infinite di-
mension is uniform over a disk [119, 120, 124, 123].
The single ring theorem concerns the confinement of
the eigenvalue distribution of a large class of non-
Hermitian random matrices within a disk or an annu-
lus [121, 125, 108, 107, 126, 109]. The annulus-to-disk
spectralcrossoverofthePQCfollowsdirectlyfromthe
study of the corresponding 1-parameter CPTP maps
[58]. In this case, the critical dissipation strength
can be calculated for an effective model using non-
Hermitian free probability. Fig. 8 shows an example
of the inner radius collapse.
Accepted in Quantum2024-08-07, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 14Figure 8: Annulus-to-disk crossover. The crossover of the
spectrum from an annulus to a disk is manifested in the
collapse of the inner radius (dashed blue line) of Eq. (35)
into a complex number. After the crossover, the outer radius
(solid red line) becomes the disk’s radius. For illustrative
purposes, we plot the example of K= 3, corresponding to a
critical dissipation strength ϵc≃0.634.
B Angular Suppression and Shift of
the Superoperator Spectrum
The angular suppression of the superoperator spec-
trum of Eq. (25)originates in the finite range of the
Hamiltonian eigenvalue distribution. In this section,
we discuss how the maximum energy gap can con-
fine all superoperator eigenvalues in a circular sector
of the complex plane, resulting in the spectral phase
crossover to a shifted disk.
Let us first illustrate how the suppression mecha-
nism breaks the rotational invariance of the spectrum
whenϵ= 0, i.e., when our system is isolated from the
environment. In this case, the Hamiltonian operator
is Hermitian, the superoperator Λj
τ,ϵis unitary, and
its eigenvalue problem becomes
Λj
τ,ϵ(|n⟩⊗|m⟩) =eijτ
ℏ( 1⊗H⊺−H⊗ 1)(|n⟩⊗|m⟩)
=eijτ
ℏ(Em−En)(|n⟩⊗|m⟩). (43)
Then, the spectrum belongs in a circular sector of
central angle 2ϕmax, whereϕmax =jτmax{Em−
En}/ℏ. In Fig. 9 c, we show the example of a
Hamiltonian sampled from GOE(64) for two differ-
ent values of τandj= 1. There, the largest en-
ergy difference is given by the semicircle (20)radius,
max{Em−En}=σ√
8d, resulting in a maximum an-
gle,ϕmax=jτσ√
8d/ℏ.
When the periodic interaction with an environment
is introduced by increasing ϵ, the above mechanism
gradually shifts the real part of the overall superoper-
ator spectrum to the right of the complex plane. For
time-independent systems, the Hamiltonian eigenval-
ues are fixed, and the only parameter controlling the
spectral crossover to a shifted-disk phase is the dis-
sipation period τ. For decreasing τ, the crossover to

a shifted disk starts roughly when ϕmax≤2π, and
ends when the characteristic radius of the spectral
locus of the dissipative term in the quantum chan-
nel becomes of the order of sin(ϕmax), as indicated
by Eq. (41). After this point, the spectrum asymp-
totically approaches the one of the dissipative part,
shifted to the right by 1−ϵ, since the overall channel
forτ→0is
Λτ→0,ϵ→(1−ϵ) 1⊗ 1+ϵK/summationdisplay
r=1Nr⊗N∗
r. (44)
If the dissipative part is composed of a set of random
Kraus-Choioperators, asintheRMTexamplesofsec-
tion 5, the shifted spectrum belongs in a disk of radius
given by the inverse of the square root of the number
of the Kraus-Choi operators ϵ/√
K[58], a result that
can also easily be obtained by taking the limit ϵ→1
in Eq. (36). In Fig. 10, we show the agreement of the
numerical calculations with thepredictionof Eq. (38).
C Shrinking of the Correlation Hole
As we have seen, the suppression of the correlation
hole in the survival probability of an initial CGS is
related to the suppression of coherence in the evolved
state, aphenomenonthatcannotbestraightforwardly
diagnosed in the spectral structure of the dynamical
generators. Fig. (11)shows the correlation hole of
the averaged SFF closing next to the corresponding
Liouvillian spectra by increasing the ED dissipation
strength of Eq. (12). This is a case of maximally in-
coherent operation leading to the complete vanish-
ing of the density matrix’s off-diagonal elements in
the energy eigenbasis. The Heisenberg time remains
unchanged, while the Thouless time is shifted to the
right.

remains unchanged.
D Time Evolution of the PQC Spec-
trum
The powers of the eigenvalues of a matrix are the
eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix powers. Ac-
cordingly, the spectral loci of the different powers of
the PQC (25)are bounded by the powers of Eq. (35),
(36)and (38), fortheannular, thediskandtheshifted
disk respectively. In the case of the annular and disk
phases, they result in concentric circles, while in the
shifted-disk case, they form the cardioids of Fig. 13.
