Abstract. This paper focuses on the modeling of experiments conducted by Billock and Tsou
[V. A. Billock and B. H. Tsou, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 104 (2007), pp. 8490–8495] using
an Amari-type neural field that models the average membrane potential of neuronal activity
in the primary visual cortex (V1). The study specifically focuses on a regular funnel pattern
localized in the fovea or the peripheral visual field. It aims to comprehend and model the visual
phenomena induced by this pattern, emphasizing their nonlinear nature. The research involves
designing sensory inputs that mimic the visual stimuli from Billock and Tsou’s experiments.
The cortical outputs induced by these sensory inputs are then theoretically and numerically
studied to assess their ability to model the experimentally observed visual effects at the V1
level. A crucial aspect of this study is the exploration of the effects induced by the nonlinear
nature of neural responses. By highlighting the significance of excitatory and inhibitory neurons
in the emergence of these visual phenomena, the research suggests that an interplay of both
types of neuronal activities plays a crucial role in visual processes, challenging the assumption
that the latter is primarily driven by excitatory activities alone.

1.Introduction
Exploring a mathematically sound approach to understanding visual illusions in human per-
ception using neural dynamics can give us valuable insights into perceptual processes and visual
organization [4, 5], and can reveal much about how precisely the brain works. Neural dynamics
refers to the patterns of activity and interactions among neurons that give rise to our ability
to see and understand the world. Our visual system processes information in different stages,
with specialized neurons at each stage extracting specific details from what we see. The visual
system shows dynamic and widespread activity patterns, from detecting basic features like edges
and orientations to putting everything together and making sense of it. The brain area which
detects basic features such as spatial position, edges, local orientations, and direction in visual
stimuli from the retina is the primary visual cortex (V1 for short), [23, 24].
Simple geometric visual hallucinations akin to that classified by Klüver [25] have been theo-
retically recovered in the last decades via the neural dynamic equation used to model the cortical
activity in V1 combined with the bijective nonlinear retino-cortical mapping [34, 41] between
the visual field and V1, see for instance, [8, 9, 16, 18, 40]. These geometric forms, known as form
constants, are obtained near a Turing-like instability using linear stability analysis, (equivariant)
bifurcation theory, and pattern selection when the cortical activity is due solely to the random
firing of V1 neurons, that is, in the absence of sensory inputs from the retina. However, to func-
tion correctly, the primary visual cortex must be primarily driven by sensory information from
the retina [23, 24], not only by the internal noisy fluctuation of its cells. Several methods have
explored how sensory inputs are processed in early visual areas. Experimental studies have been
conducted [20], along with experimentally induced phenomena via psychophysical tests [6, 7, 33,
31, 27, 28]. Additionally, theoretical tools like the Lie transformation group model have been
applied to analyze perceptual processes [13, 22]. Despite these efforts, using theoretical neu-
ral dynamics, our understanding of the precise neuronal mechanisms underlying visual illusions
remains elusive. It has been known since Helmholtz’s work [21] that even simple geometrical pat-
terns comprising black and white zones may induce strong after-images1accompanying a visual
perception after a few seconds. Then, via redundant and non-redundant stimulation by funnel
(fan shape) and tunnel (concentric rings) patterns (see Figure 1), MacKay [27, 28] points out
that there is some kind of orthogonal response in the visual cortex since funnel pattern induces
a superimposed (to the physical stimulus) tunnel pattern as an after-image, and conversely.
More recently, Nicks et al.[30] have built on the foundation of neural field equations of
Amari-type [1, Eq. (3)] to model MacKay-type visual illusions induced by specific visual stimuli
at the cortical level. Their model, which represents cortical activity in V1, incorporates a fully
distributed state-dependent sensory input. This input models the cortical representation via the
retino-cortical map of funnel and tunnel patterns. Theoretically, they proved these experimental
findings, demonstrating an orthogonal response of V1 to visual inputs. The present authors have
1In the experiments of [6], observers perceive an illusory image in their visual field after viewing a visual
stimulus, and this image persists for a few seconds. This is what we refer to when using the term after-image .REPRODUCIBILITY VIA NEURAL FIELDS OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS INDUCED BY LOCALIZED STIMULI 3

corresponding pattern of vertical stripes is in V1. In particular, these images

plane’s motion group [8].
further sustained this evidence in their previous works [37, 39]. In particular, by using the
neural field equation of Amari-type, we have shown that the underlying Euclidean symmetry
of V1 (see, for instance, [8]) restricts the geometrical shape of visual inputs that can induce a
“strong” after-effect in the primary visual cortex. If the visual input is symmetric with respect to
a subgroup of the group of the motion of the plane (refer to [37, Appendix A]), then the induced
after-image obtained via the Amari-type equation and the inverse retino-cortical map have the
samesubgroupasagroupofsymmetry. Thelattersuggeststhattheafter-imagesinducedbyfully
distributed tunnel and funnel patterns (more generally spontaneous patterns obtained through
Turing-like instability [8, 16, 40]) that fill all the visual field have the same shape. Moreover, we
exhibited in [38, 39] numerical simulations using the Amari-type equation, showing that if the
funnelpatternis localizedeitherin thefovea(centreofthevisualfield) orintheperipheralvisual
field, then the induced after-image consisting of the tunnel pattern appears in the white or black
complementary region where the stimulus is not localized–also demonstrating orthogonal and
non-local response–in V1. These numerical simulations, therefore, sustain the psychophysical
experiments reported by Billock and Tsou [6], see also [7]. Note that numerical simulations4 CYPRIEN TAMEKUE, DARIO PRANDI, AND YACINE CHITOUR

(including those for rotating after-images that are not considered in this paper) performed in
[30] also support the latter psychophysical experiments.
1.1.Billock and Tsou’s psychophysical experiments. Significant visual effects associated
with funnel and tunnel patterns have been recently observed in the psychophysical experiments
conducted by Billock and Tsou [6]. Like the MacKay effect [27, 28], these authors discovered
that introducing biased stimuli elicits orthogonal responses in the visual field. When a physical
stimulus is localized at the fovea (the central region of the visual field), the resulting visual illu-
sion appears in the flickering periphery. Conversely, the visual illusion emerges in the flickering
centre if the physical stimulus is presented in the periphery. Specifically, when a background
flicker is combined with a funnel pattern centered on the fovea (or periphery), the observer
experiences the illusory perception of a tunnel pattern in the periphery (or fovea, respectively).
Similarly, when the periphery (or fovea) of a tunnel pattern localized at the fovea (or periph-
ery) is subjected to flickering, an illusory rotating funnel pattern is perceived in the periphery
(or fovea). In all cases, the illusory contours in the afterimage appear within the nonflickering
region, depending on whether the flicker does not extend through the physical stimulus or if the
empty region is flickered out of phase. Refer to Fig. 2 for a visual illustration.

section. Our approach is mechanistic: we describe a possible model of how cortical dynamicsREPRODUCIBILITY VIA NEURAL FIELDS OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS INDUCED BY LOCALIZED STIMULI 5
induce the phenomena under consideration. The matter of whyneurons behave this way is
outside the scope of this article, albeit being a very active topic of investigation in theoretical
neuroscience [10, 26, 32] . We will follow the idea of controllability of the Amari-type neural
field introduced in [37, 39] that we will recall hereafter. In particular, we stress why these visual
phenomena are nonlinear, as first pointed out in [38].
From a control theory point of view, the first aim is to design a suitable sensory input I,
V1 representation via the retino-cortical map of visual stimulus from the retina used in the
experiment such that the cortical state a:R+×R2→Rsolution to the following Amari-type
control system
∂ta(x,t) +a(x,t)−µ/integraldisplay
R2ω(x−y)f(a(y,t))dy=I(x), (t,x)∈R+×R2
a(x,0) =a0(x), x∈R2(NF)
exponentially stabilizes to the stationary state, corresponding to the V1 representation via the
retino-cortical map of the induced after-image reported by Billock and Tsou. Following [8,
16], we assume that the perceived image is obtained by applying the inverse retino-cortical
map to the cortical state. Secondly, we will perform a quantitative and qualitative study of
this stationary output to show that it captures all the essential features of the visual illusion
announced by Billock and Tsou at the V1 level. To this aim, we follow a numerical analysis
approach specifically designed to address the complex nonlinear dynamics characteristic of the
considered neural fields model.
Equation (NF) has been introduced in [1] (see also [11] for a recent overview on neural field
models) to describe the dynamics of the average membrane potential of the neurons located at
the pointx∈R2at timet≥0. The time-evolution of the average membrane potential at time
t≥0isgivenbythemap x∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→a(x,t). ThestateofcorticalactivityinV1attime t= 0isassumed
to be given by the function a0. The neural field equation (NF) can be seen as the combined
action of the external stimulus I, the natural decay rate or leakage of the neurons’ average
membrane potential towards their resting states, and an integral term representing the intra-
neural connectivity, modulated by the parameter µ > 0. The latter consists of a convolution
product between the synaptic connectivity kernel ω, modeling the spatial relationship between
neurons, and the non-linear term given by the response function fapplied toa, which transforms
the activity level of a neural population at location yand timetinto an output signal. (See
Definition 1.) Therefore, once the signal reaches V1, it will interact with local neural dynamics
captured by this equation. The equation then models how V1 responds to this input while
accounting for local interactions (via the connectivity kernel ω) and nonlinearities in neural
activity (via the response function f).
In biological brain tissue, neurons can be excitatory or inhibitory [23, 24], and an inhibitory
neuron decreases the likelihood that a post-synaptic neuron will send out electrical signals or
spike to communicate with other brain cells. A negative value for f(a(y,t))might capture this
inhibitory influence. Notice also that a nonnegative function f(a(y,t))≥0would imply that all
neurons, regardlessoftheircurrentactivitylevel, providesomeexcitatoryoutput. Thisoverlooks
the crucial role of inhibitory neurons in shaping neural activity. Moreover, as evident from the
study we will present in this paper, a model lacking inhibitory activity is likely insufficient for
capturing certain phenomena such as that reported by Billock and Tsou. In the latter case, we
will also see that a complex interplay between excitatory and inhibitory activity [19, 35] in the
shape offis required and plays a crucial role since an odd nonlinearity does not model the
phenomenon.6 CYPRIEN TAMEKUE, DARIO PRANDI, AND YACINE CHITOUR
Therefore, the effect that plays the non-linearity fon the reproducibility of Billock and Tsou’s
experiments using (NF) will be highlighted. As we previously pointed out in [38, Fig. 8], these
phenomena are wholly nonlinear and strongly depend on the shape of the nonlinear function f.
Different models for cortical activity are available (e.g., the original Wilson-Cowan model for
excitatory/inhibitory populations [42]). The choice of an Amari-type neural field is motivated
by the fact that equation (NF) is sufficient for describing the spontaneous formation of funnel
and tunnel patterns [8, Eq. (16)] in V1, and we expect it also to be suitable for describing
psychophysical experiments involving these patterns. Moreover, it is more amenable to mathe-
matical analysis and yields the same qualitative behaviors as the original Wilson-Cowan model
in many neural processes modeling [15]. We also mention that the Amari-type neural field has
been successfully applied to reproduce visual illusions [2, 5], and has recently been connected
with the Divisive Normalization from visual psychophysics [29].
In this work, we focus on fixed contrast stimuli. We stress that as a consequence of our results,
one can easily obtain that, for a fixed nonlinearity, the illusory phenomena are not reproduced
for small contrast.
NoticethatwhilesensoryinputsinBillockandTsou’sexperimentsaretime-varying, ourstudy
finds that a temporal flicker of the complementary region where the stimulus is not localized is
not necessary to reproduce these intriguing visual phenomena (an observation already made in
[30]). OurinterpretationisthatBillockandTsou’sphenomenaresultwhollyfromtheunderlying
non-local and nonlinear properties of neural activity in V1 rather than the temporal flickering
of the complementary region where the stimulus is not localized. In particular, the flickering
should instead be in the origin of illusory motions that subjects perceived in the after-images.
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: Section 1.3 recalls some general notations
used throughout the following. We present assumptions on model parameters used in (NF)
in Section 2.1. Section 2.2 describes the mathematical modeling of visual stimuli associated
with funnel patterns used in Billock and Tsou’s experiments. In Section 3, we recall some
preliminary results related to the well-posedness of equation (NF) and those in the direction
of modeling Billock and Tsou’s experiments associated with a funnel pattern localized either in
the fovea or in the peripheral visual field. The modeling of the phenomena using (NF) starts
precisely in Section 4. In Section 4.1, we prove that the stationary output of (NF) associated
with a pattern of horizontal stripes localized in the left area of V1 does not contain a pattern of
vertical stripes in the white complementary region (the right area of V1) but rather a mixture
of horizontal and vertical stripes if the response function is linear. In Section 4.2, we prove
that even with certain nonlinear response functions that exhibit strong inhibitory or excitatory
influences and a weak slope, or a balance between excitatory and inhibitory influences, the
stationary output of (NF) associated with a pattern of horizontal stripes localized in the left
area of V1 is identical with that of the linear response function. Section 5 focuses precisely on
proving that if, for instance, the response function in (NF) exhibits a good interplay between
excitatory and inhibitory influence and a weak slope, then the stationary output associated with
a pattern of horizontal stripes localized in the left area of V1 contains a pattern of vertical stripes
in the white complementary region (the right area of V1) as Billock and Tsou reported. For this
aim, we follow a numerical analysis-type of argument in Section 5.1, together with an analysis
of the corresponding numerical schemes. Section 5.2 presents some numerical simulations that
bolster our theoretical study. Finally, in Section 6, we discuss the main results of our paper and
highlight areas for future work. We defer to Appendix A, the proof of some technical results
used in the paper.REPRODUCIBILITY VIA NEURAL FIELDS OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS INDUCED BY LOCALIZED STIMULI 7

the Euclidean norm of x∈Rd. Forp∈ {1,∞},Lp(Rd)is the Lebesgue space of class of
real-valued measurable functions uonRdsuch that|u|is integrable over Rdifp= 1, and
|u|is essentially bounded over Rdwhenp=∞. We endow these spaces with their standard
norms∥u∥1=/integraltext
Rd|u(x)|dxand∥u∥∞= ess supx∈Rd|u(x)|. We letC([0,∞);L∞(Rd))be the
space of all real-valued functions uonRd×[0,∞)such that,u(x,·)is continuous on [0,∞)for
a.e., x∈Rdandu(·,t)∈Lp(Rd)for everyt∈[0,∞). We endow this space with the norm

We letS(Rd)be the Schwartz space of rapidly-decreasing C∞(Rd)functions, andS′(Rd)be

Finally, the following notation will be helpful: if Fis a real-valued function defined on R2,
we useF−1({0})to denote the zero level-set of F.
2.Assumption on parameters and mathematical modeling of visual stimuli
In this section, we will present assumptions that we will consider on the parameters in (NF),
specifically on the response function fand on the connectivity kernel ω, as it is highlighted
in Section 2.1. Then, in Section 2.2, we will present how we mathematically model the visual
stimuli used in Billock and Tsou’s experiments associated with a regular funnel pattern localized
in the fovea or peripheral visual field that we incorporate as sensory inputs in (NF).
2.1.Assumption on parameters in the Amari-type equation. We make the following
assumption on parameters involved in (NF).
Coupling kernel : In this article, we use a spatially homogeneous and isotropic interaction ker-
nelωin relation to coordinates (x1,x2). It depends solely on the Euclidean distance among
neurons, showing rotational symmetry. The “Mexican-hat” distribution is employed, a variant
of the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) model with two components. The first Gaussian gov-
erns short-range excitatory interactions, and the second Gaussian models long-range inhibitory
interactions in V1 neurons. Thus, the connectivity kernel is taken as:
ω(x) = [2πσ2
1]−1e−|x|2
2σ2
1−κ[2πσ2
2]−1e−|x|2
2σ2
2, x∈R2(2.1)
whereκ>0, andσ1andσ2satisfy 0<σ 1<σ 2andσ1√κ<σ 2. The latter condition is crucial
for explicitly calculating the L1-norm ofω, as detailed in (2.3).
Note thatω(x)is equivalent to ω(|x|), andωbelongs to the Schwartz space S(R2). The
Fourier transform of ωis explicitly given by:
/hatwideω(ξ) =e−2π2σ2

Let us mention that ωmight not satisfy the balanced condition/hatwideω(0) = 0, an equilibrium
between excitation and inhibition. Nonetheless, this equilibrium is achieved when κ= 1.
Finally, in the sequel, we use the letter Cωto denote any positive constant depending only
on the parameters involved in the definition of ω.
Response function : The choice of the response function fis crucial, and it is motivated by
authors’ previous works [38, 39]. Indeed, in [39, Figs. 5 and 6] we illustrated the capability of
Equation (NF) to reproduce Billock and Tsou experiments with the nonlinear response function
f(s) = (1+exp(−s+0.25))−1−(1+exp(0.25))−1, andthatf(s) = tanh(s)doesnotreproducethe
phenomenon, suggesting that certain (non-odd) sigmoidal-type response functions are required
to model the phenomenon. In [38, Section 4], we briefly explained why the stationary output
pattern of the Amari-type (NF) does not capture the essential features of the visual illusions
reported by Billock and Tsou’s when the response function is linear. Moreover, still in [38,
Fig. 8], by considering the “sigmoidal-type” response function fm,α(s) = max(−m,min(1,αs))
withm≥0andα>0, we figured out ranges on parameters mandαfor which the stationary
output pattern of the Amari-type (NF) captures the essential features of the visual illusions
reported by Billock and Tsou’s. More precisely, [38, Fig. 8] suggests that nonnegative f0,α,
oddf1,αwith 0< α <∞, nonlinearities fm,αwith strong inhibitory influence m > 1and
weak slope 0< α < 1as well as nonlinearities fm,αwith strong excitatory influence and weak
slope 0< α < m≤1do not model Billock and Tsou’s experiments associated with a regular
funnel pattern localized either in the fovea or in the peripheral visual field. While for other
values ofmandα, (NF) with the response function fm,αcaptures the essential features of theREPRODUCIBILITY VIA NEURAL FIELDS OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS INDUCED BY LOCALIZED STIMULI 9
visual illusions reported by Billock and Tsou (either the “strong” or the “weak” phenomenon,
as recalled in Section 1.1).
Observe also that fm,αis a non-smooth “mathematical approximation” of the following sig-
moid function, frequently used in neural field models like (NF),
gγ,ν(s) := (1 + exp(−γ(s−ν)))−1−(1 + exp(κν))−1, γ > 0,ν > 0.
In this paper, when referring to a response function, we will always assume the following.
Definition 1. A response function is a non-decreasing Lipschitz continuous function f:R→R
such thatf(0) = 0,fis differentiable at 0, andα:=f′(0) =∥f′∥∞.
Of particular interest in the rest of the paper is the family of response functions given by
fm,α(s) = max(−m,min(1,αs)) =

for every 0≤m<∞and0<α<∞, or by
f∞,α(s) = min(1,αs)s∈R (2.4)
for every 0< α <∞. Please refer to Figure 3 for a visual illustration. Notice that, whenever
m≥0is finite,fm,αis bounded.
Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the spatially forced pattern-forming mechanism that we
are studying is qualitatively the same if instead of fm,αwe use the smooth sigmoid gγ,νsince
the neural field model (NF) is structurally stable.
The intra-neural connectivity parameter µ>0: Following our previous works [37, 38, 39],
we assume that µ>0is smaller than the threshold parameter µc>0where certain geometric
patterns spontaneously emerge in V1 in the absence of sensory inputs from the retina, see for
instance, [8, 12, 16, 30]. This threshold parameter is referred to as the bifurcation point, and it
is analytically given by
µc:=1
f′m,α(0)/hatwideω(qc)=1
α/hatwideω(qc)
where/hatwideω(qc)is defined by (2.2). Moreover, we let
µ0:=1
f′m,α(0)∥ω∥1=1
α∥ω∥1≤µc (2.5)
be the largest value of µup to which we can ensure the existence and uniqueness of a stationary
solution to (NF) in the space L∞(R2). We henceforth assume that
µ<µ 0.
Remark 2.1. The response function fm,αis globally bounded for all finite m≥0andα > 0
ensuring that, independently of µ>0, the solution a∈C([0,∞);L∞(Rd))of (NF) is uniformly
bounded for t∈[0,+∞), for any initial datum a0∈L∞(R2)and sensory input I∈L∞(R2). See
for instance [37, Theorem B.6.]. Although the semilinear response function f∞,αis unbounded,
we prove in Section 3 that this is still true under the assumption µ<µ 0.10 CYPRIEN TAMEKUE, DARIO PRANDI, AND YACINE CHITOUR

2.2.Mathematical modeling of visual stimuli. In this section, we mathematically model
the cortical representation of visual stimuli associated with funnel patterns used in Billock and
Tsou’s experiments. Then, we incorporate them as sensory inputs in (NF). Note that we are
devoted to modeling the static version of these phenomena. Here, “static” refers to a physical
visual stimulus that induces an afterimage on the retina, resulting in illusory contours that
do not exhibit apparent motion. Consequently, we will not consider a time-dependent sensory
input, whichshouldincorporatethemodelingofflickeringemployedintheexperiment. However,
as we already pointed out, this consideration will be enough for the corresponding stationary
output pattern of (NF) to capture all the essential features (illusory contours) of the after-image
reported by Billock and Tsou.
Recall that the functional architecture of V1 exhibits a remarkable characteristic known as
retinotopic organization [41]: the neurons in the V1 area are arranged orderly, forming a to-
pographic or retinotopic map (well-known as the retino-cortical map). This map represents
a two-dimensional projection of the visual image formed on the retina. Notably, neighboring
regions of the visual field are represented by neighboring regions of neurons in V1, establishing
a bijective relationship.
Up to the authors’ knowledge, the retino-cortical map was first represented analytically as a
complex logarithmic map in [34]. Let (r,θ)∈[0,∞)×[0,2π)denote polar coordinates in the
visual field (or in the retina) and (x1,x2)∈R2Cartesian coordinates in V1. The retino-cortical
map (see also [39] and references within) is analytically given by
reiθ∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→(x1,x2) := (logr,θ). (2.6)
Due to the retino-cortical map analytical representation (2.6) and consistent with spontaneous
patterns description [8, 16], we consider that the function which generates the funnel pattern is
given in Cartesian coordinates x:= (x1,x2)∈R2of V1 by
PF(x) = cos(2πλx 2), λ> 0.
Let us point out that one of the fundamental properties of the retinotopic projection of the
visual field into V1 is that small objects centred on the fovea (centre of the visual field) have
a much larger representation in V1 than do similar objects in the peripheral visual field. AsREPRODUCIBILITY VIA NEURAL FIELDS OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS INDUCED BY LOCALIZED STIMULI 11

a result, the cortical representation of Billock and Tsou’s visual stimulus associated, e.g., with
the funnel pattern localized respectively in the fovea and in the peripheral visual field, should
consist of taking the sensory input as

Note thatILandIRcorrespond to sensory inputs consisting of horizontal stripes in the left

are alternating sequences of white and black zones, we represent every cortical function, say IR,
as defined in (2.7) in terms of a binary image, corresponding to the zero-level set of IR, in the
following way: in the regions where IR>0we put the black grayscale and whereIR≤0we put
thewhite grayscale , refer for instance, to Figures 5 and 7.

funnel pattern ILlocalized in the left area of V1 since the same analysis can be straightforwardly

3.Preliminary results on the Amari-type equation
In this section, we begin by discussing the concept of a stationary state as it applies to (NF).
Following this, we review essential preliminary findings related to the well-posedness of the same
equation that is necessary to comprehend the rest of the paper.
Definition 2 (Stationary state) .Leta0∈Lp(R2). For every I∈Lp(R2), a stationary state
aI∈Lp(R2)to (NF) is a time-invariant solution, viz.
aI=µω∗f(aI) +I. (SS)
The following well-posedness result is [37, Theorem 3.1], which only relies on the global
Lipschitz property of the nonlinearity f.12 CYPRIEN TAMEKUE, DARIO PRANDI, AND YACINE CHITOUR
Theorem 3.1 ([37]).LetI∈L∞(R2). For any initial datum a0∈L∞R2), there exists a unique
a∈C([0,∞);L∞(Rd)), solution to (NF). Ifµ < µ 0, there exists a unique stationary state
aI∈L∞(R2)to(NF). Moreover, the following holds.
∥a(·,t)−aI∥∞≤e−(1−µ∥ω∥1)t∥a0−aI∥∞,for anyt≥0.
In the following theorem, we prove the uniform boundedness of the solution under the as-
sumptions of Section 2.1.
Theorem 3.2. Leta0∈L∞(R2),I∈L∞(R2)anda∈C([0,∞);L∞(Rd))be the solution of
(NF). Then,

One also has the following.

Then, for any m≥mαthe stationary solution of (NF)with response function fm,αcoincides
with the unique stationary solution to the same equation with response function fmα,α.
Proof.By Theorem 3.1, the stationary solution am,α∈L∞(R2)to (NF) with response function
fm,αis the unique solution of am,α=I+µω∗fm,α(am,α). In particular, by definition of mα,
inequality (3.1) implies that

sincefm,α(s) =fmα,α(s)for everys≥−mα/α. It follows that am,αis a stationary solution
for (NF) with nonlinearity fmα,α. The statement follows by the uniqueness of the stationary
solution provided by Theorem 3.1. □
Applied, for instance, to Billock and Tsou’s experiments modeling, Proposition 3.3 implies
the following simple but important result.
Corollary 3.4. Under the same assumptions as Proposition 3.3, let m≥mαbe such that the
response function fm,αreproduces Billock and Tsou’s experiments. Then, the same is true for
any response function fm,αsuch thatm≥m.
The following result proves that the stationary state to (NF) is Lipschitz continuous whenever
the sensory input Iis.
Proposition 3.5. Assume that µ < µ 0. If the sensory input I∈L∞(R2)isLI-Lipschitz
continuous on some open set Ω⊂R2, then the corresponding stationary solution to equation
(NF)is also Lipschitz continuous on Ω, with Lipschitz constant upper bounded by
DI:=LI+µmαCω (3.6)
whereCωdenotes a constant depending only on ω.
Proof.Leta∈L∞(R2)be the unique stationary solution whose existence is guaranteed by
Theorem 3.1. For x∈R2we have that
a(x) =I(x) +µb(x)withb:=ω∗f(a).
Sinceω∈S(R2)andf(a)∈L∞(R2), one has that bis infinitely differentiable on R2. Since by

The following simple result will be used hereafter.
Lemma 3.6. Assume that the response function fin(NF)is odd. Ifµ<µ 0, for any sensory
inputI∈L∞(R2)one hasa9I=−aI.
Proof.Thanks to Theorem 3.1, we have that aIanda9Iare uniquely defined by aI=I+
µω∗f(aI)anda9I=−I+µω∗f(a9I), respectively. Since fis odd, one has aI+a9I=
µω∗[f(aI)−f(−a9I)]. Therefore,∥aI+a9I∥∞= 0since Young convolution inequality gives

In the following, we prove more general results that provide insight into the qualitative prop-
erties of the stationary state of (NF) when the sensory input has a cosine factor.
Proposition 3.7. Let the sensory input Ibe given by I(x1,x2) = cos(2πλx 2)I1(x1), forλ>0
and(x1,x2)∈R2, whereI1∈L∞(R). Ifµ<µ 0, then the following hold.
(1)aIis1/λ-periodic, even and globally Lipschitz continuous with respect to x2∈R;
(2) Iffis odd, then aIis1/2λ-antiperiodic with respect to x2∈R. Namely,
aI(x1,x2+ 1/2λ) =−aI(x1,x2),for a.e. (x1,x2)∈R2.
Proof.Weassumethat λ= 1foreaseofnotation. Usingthattheconvolutionoperatorcommutes
with translation and that the input Iand the kernel ωare even with respect to x2, one deduces
thataIis even with respect to x2. Let us prove that aIis1-periodic with respect to x2. For
a.e.(x1,x2)∈R2, one has
aI(x1,x2+ 1) = cos(2 πλx 2)I1(x1) +µ/integraldisplay
R2ω(x1−y1,x2+ 1−y2)f(aI(y))dy
=I(x1,x2) +µ/integraldisplay
R2ω(x−y)f(aI(y1,y2+ 1))dy.
It follows that (x1,x2)∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→aI(x1,x2+ 1)is the stationary solution associated with Iand hence
it coincides with aI.
Let us show that aIis Lipschitz continuous with respect to x2. Taking the derivative of (4.2)
with respect to x2, one finds that for a.e. (x1,x2)∈R2it holds
∂x2a(x1,x2) =−2πsin(2πx2)I1(x1) +µ/integraldisplay
R2ω(x−y)f′(aI(y))∂x2a(y)dy.
Since∥f′∥∞≤αby assumption, it follows that
∥∂x2a(x1,·)∥L∞(R)≤2π∥I1∥∞(1−µ/µ 0)−1
for a.e.x1∈R, showing that aI(x1,·)is Lipschitz continuous for a.e. x1∈R. This completes
the proof of item(1).
Let us now prove item(2). For a.e. (x1,x2)∈R2, one has
−aI(x1,x2+ 1/2) = cos(2 πλx 2)I1(x1)−µ/integraldisplay
R2ω(x1−y1,x2+ 1/2−y2)f(aI(y))dy
=I(x1,x2) +µ/integraldisplay
R2ω(x−y)f(−aI(y1,y2+ 1/2))dy
where in the last equality we used the fact that fis odd. Hence, (x1,x2)∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→−aI(x1,x2+ 1/2)
is the stationary solution associated with Iand hence it coincides with aI. □
One has the following result related to Billock and Tsou’s experiments, which is the main
focus of this paper. The proof is an adaptation of that of [37, Theorem 5.2]. We will present it
for the sake of completeness.
Proposition 3.8. Assume that the response function fin(NF)is odd. Let the sensory input
ILbe given by (2.7). Ifµ<µ 0/2, denote by aL∈L∞(R2)the corresponding stationary state to
IL. Then, for a.e. x1∈R, the set of zeros of aL(x1,·)coincides with that of x2∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→cos(2πλx 2).
Proof.We assume that λ= 1for ease of notation. The zeroes of x2∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→cos(2πx2)arezk=k+1/4
for everyk∈Z. Letx1∈R, let us first prove that aI(x1,zk) = 0. SinceaI(x1,·)is1-periodic by
Proposition3.7,itisenoughtoprovethat aI(x1,1/4) = 0. Usingthat aI(x1,·)is1/2-antiperiodicREPRODUCIBILITY VIA NEURAL FIELDS OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS INDUCED BY LOCALIZED STIMULI 15
and even by Proposition 3.7, one gets aI(x1,1/4) =aI(x1,−1/4 + 1/2) =−aI(x1,−1/4) =
−aI(x1,1/4). Therefore, aI(x1,1/4) = 0. Conversely, let x∗:= (x∗
1,x∗
2)∈R2be such that
aL(x∗) = 0. We want to show that cos(2πx∗
2) = 0. Recall that for a.e. x:= (x1,x2)∈R2,
aL(x) = cos(2πx2)H(θL−x1) +µ/integraldisplay
R2ω(x−y)f(aL(y))dy. (3.9)
Ifx∗
1≤θL, then from (3.9), it follows
cos(2πx∗
2) =−µ/integraldisplay
R2ω(y)f(aF(x∗−y))dy. (3.10)
By using (3.9) once again, one obtains
aL(x∗

R2k(y,z)f(aL(x∗−z))dz (3.11)
whereI2(y) := sin(2πx∗
2) sin(2πy2)H(θL−x∗

k(y,z) =ω(y−z)−H(θL−x∗

satisfies

R2|k(y,z)|dy≤2∥ω∥1.
Sinceµ<µ 0/2, the contracting mapping principle ensures that y∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→g2(y) :=aL(x∗−y)is the
unique solution to (3.11). Moreover, it holds
−aL(x∗

R2k(y,z)f(−aL(x∗

sincefis odd. So the function (y1,y2)∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→−g2(y1,−y2)is also solution of (3.11) with input I2.
By uniqueness of solution, one has g2(y1,−y2) =−g2(y1,y2)and thaty∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→ω(y)f(aL(x∗−y))is
an odd function with respect to y2∈R, sinceωis radial and fis an odd function. It follows
from Fubini’s theorem that the right-hand side of (3.10) is equal to 0. □
Remark 3.9. Note that the assumption µ < µ 0/2in Proposition 3.8 is technical due to our
strategy in the proof. Numerical simulations suggest that the conclusion of the proposition
remains valid for all µ0/2≤µ<µ 0. See, for instance, Figure 8.
4.On Billock and Tsou’s experiments modelling
In this section, we investigate the modeling of Billock and Tsou’s phenomena using (NF). In
the current study, we aim to elucidate the efficacy of (NF) in mimicking these visual illusions,
as briefly reviewed in Section 1.1. We focus on determining if the model’s output exhibits
qualitative concordance with the human experience of these illusions. It is imperative to note
that our analysis is mechanistic and strictly qualitative and serves as an illustrative proof of
concept for applying Amary-type dynamics (NF) in simulating the perceptual outcomes elicited
by visual illusions as previously obtained in [37] for the visual MacKay effect modeling. This
study does not endeavor to align its findings with quantitative empirical data, as such data are
contingentuponnumerousexperimentalvariablesthatdonothaveastraightforwardrelationship
with the parameters within our model.
We begin by proving that these phenomena are wholly nonlinear in contrast, for instance, to
the visual MacKay effect [27] that we proved in [37] for being a linear phenomenon. Therefore,
we will see that (NF) with a linear response function fcannot reproduce the psychophysical16 CYPRIEN TAMEKUE, DARIO PRANDI, AND YACINE CHITOUR

[36].
experiments by Billock and Tsou [6] associated with the funnel pattern stimulus when the
corresponding sensory inputs are modeled as in (2.7).
4.1.Unreproducibility of Billock and Tsou experiments: linear response function.
This section assumes that the response function fis linear. To simplify our analysis, we specif-
ically focus on the funnel pattern centred on the fovea within the visual field. As a result, the
corresponding sensory input Iconsists of a localized pattern of horizontal stripes in the left area
of the V1 cortex by the retino-cortical map, see Figure 5.
Previously, in [38, Proposition 5.], we proved that (NF) with a linear response function is
incapable of reproducing Billock and Tsou’s experiments, as verified through direct Fourier
transform computations. While this finding sufficed to establish our desired outcome, it failed
to offer deeper insights into the qualitative properties of the stationary state associated with the
sensoryinpututilizedintheseexperiments. Specifically,itdidnotpreciselycharacterizethezero-
level set of this stationary state. To address this gap, we draw upon the qualitative properties
of the sensory input Iand utilize tools from complex and harmonic analysis. Consequently, we
present the following key results in this section.
Theorem 4.1. Assume that the response function fin(NF)is linear with slope α>0and that
the sensory input I=IL. Ifµ<µ 0, denote by aL∈L∞(R2)the corresponding stationary state
toIL. Then, the zero-level set ZaLofaLsatisfies
ZaL∩[(0,+∞)×R] = [X1×R]∪[(0,+∞)×X 2] (4.1)
whereX1andX2are discrete and countable sets, respectively in (0,+∞)andR.
Sincef(s) =αsandIL(x1,x2) = cos(2πλx 2)H(θL−x1), withλ>0andθL≥0, we assume
without loss of generality that α= 1,λ= 1andθL= 0to keep the presentation clear for readerREPRODUCIBILITY VIA NEURAL FIELDS OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS INDUCED BY LOCALIZED STIMULI 17
convenience. Therefore, the stationary state aL∈L∞(R2)satisfies
aL(x1,x2) = cos(2πx2)H(−x1) +µ/integraldisplay
R2ω(x−y)aL(y)dy, (x1,x2)∈R2(4.2)
where the kernel ωis defined in (2.1).
We pedagogically split the proof of Theorem 4.1 into several steps. The first result is the
following.
Lemma 4.2. Under hypotheses of Theorem 4.1, the stationary state aLdecomposes as
aL(x1,x2) =a1(x1) cos(2πx2), (x1,x2)∈R2. (4.3)
Herea1∈L∞(R)is given by
a1(x1) =H(−x1) +µ(K∗H(−·))(x1), x 1∈R. (4.4)
whereK∈S(R)is defined for all x1∈Rby

for everyξ∈R.
Proof.We fixx1∈R. Sincex2∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→aL(x1,x2)is1-periodic and even on R, we expand aL(x1,·)
in term of Fourier series as
aL(x1,x2) =∞/summationdisplay

a0(x1) =/integraldisplay1

0aL(x1,t) cos(2πnt)dt. (4.7)
Thanks to the item(1) of Proposition 3.7, one has that the derivative a′
L(x1,·)ofaLwith respect
tox2is continuous and bounded on R. Thusa′
L(x1,·)belongs toL2([−1,1]), the space of real-
valued measurable and square-integrable functions over [−1,1]. SinceaL(x1,·)is absolutely
continuous (Lipschtiz continuous still by the item(1) of Proposition 3.7) on R, it follows from
[17, Théorème 2.] that its Fourier series converges uniformly to aL(x1,·)onR. Observe also
that (4.7) defines functions an∈L∞(R)for alln∈N, so that one gets for all x1∈Rand for all
σ>0, the existence of M > 0such that

Therefore, we can substitute (4.6) into (4.2) and find the following family of one-dimensional

whereδis the Dirac distribution at 0. Taking the Fourier transform of (4.9) in the space S′(R),
one obtains for all ξ∈R,
(1−µ/hatwiderψn(ξ))F{an}(ξ) = 0, n̸= 1.
It is not difficult to see that max{/hatwiderψn(ξ)|ξ∈R}≤max{/hatwideω(ξ)|ξ∈R2}≤∥ω∥1. Sinceµ∥ω∥1<1
by assumption, one deduces 1−µ/hatwiderψn(ξ)>0for allξ∈R, andF{an}≡0. It follows that
an≡0,for all n̸= 1.
In the case n= 1, one has
a1(x1) =H(−x1) +µ(ψ1∗a1)(x1), x 1∈R. (4.10)
Finally, taking respectively the Fourier transform of (4.10) and the inverse Fourier transform
in the spaceS′(R), we find that a1∈L∞(R2)is given by (4.4) with K∈S(R)defined as in
(4.5). □
Due to Lemma 4.2, inverting the kernel Kdefined in (4.5) and providing an asymptotic
behavior of its zeroes on Rwill help to provide thorough information on the zeroes of the
functiona1as given by (4.4). To achieve this, we use tools from complex analysis.

commensurable, i.e., α1/α2is rational, which is equivalent to σ2

Remark 4.4. Thanks to Remark 4.3, without loss of generality, we can set parameters in the
kernelωin (2.1) are such that κ= 1,σ1= 1/π√
2andσ2=σ1√
2. We also let µ= 1.
Using Theorem A.2, and arguing similarly as in the proof of [37, Proposition 5.12.], we can
prove thata1has a discrete and countable set of zeroes in (0,+∞), under the considerations in
Remark 4.4.
Proof of Theorem 4.1. To complete the proof of Theorem 4.1, it suffices to consider Lemma 4.2,
Theorem A.2 and observe that aLgiven by (4.3) satisfies (4.1). □
A consequence of Theorem 4.1 is the following.
Corollary 4.5. Assumeµ<µ 0and that the response function fis linear. Then, Equation (NF)
does not reproduce Billock and Tsou’s experiments associated with a sensory input consisting of
a pattern of horizontal stripes localized in the left area in the cortex V1.REPRODUCIBILITY VIA NEURAL FIELDS OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS INDUCED BY LOCALIZED STIMULI 19
Proof.Given that the sensory input in equation (NF) is a pattern consisting of horizontal stripes
localized in the left area in the cortex V1, Theorem 4.1 shows that the corresponding stationary
state consists of a mixture of patterns of horizontal and vertical stripes in the right area in V1
instead of vertical stripes only, as Billock and Tsou reported. □
4.2.Unreproducibility of Billock and Tsou’s experiments with certain nonlinear re-
sponse functions. As we recalled in Section 2.1, the numerical results provided in [38, Fig. 8]
suggest that a complex interplay of excitatory and inhibitory activity is required to model com-
plex phenomena like Billock and Tsou’s experiments using the Amari-type neural fields (NF).
In particular, they suggest adopting a nonlinear function fm,αthat allows for positive and nega-
tive values but is not odd, breaking the symmetry between excitatory and inhibitory influences.
More precisely, [38, Fig. 8] suggests that the stationary output of (NF) computed with the fol-
lowing response functions does not capture the essential features of visual illusions reported by
Billock and Tsou. For s∈R, they are given by:
(NL1)Nonnegative (wholly excitatory influence) nonlinearities:
f0,α(s) = max(0,min(1,αs)), 0<α<∞,
(NL2)Odd (balanced inhibitory and excitatory influence) nonlinearities:
f1,α(s) = max(−1,min(1,αs)), 0<α<∞,

(NL4)Nonlinearities with a strong inhibitory influence and a weak slope:
fm,α(s) = max(−m,min(1,αs)), 0<α< 1<m.
This section aims to provide analytical insight into why the Amari-type neural fields (NF)
do not model Billock and Tsou’s experiments when the response function is taken to be one of
(NL2)-(NL4). The main focus will be on the study of the qualitative properties in terms of
the zero-level set of the stationary solution to (NF) obtained with each of these nonlinearities
when the sensory input is taken as ILdefined in (2.7). We are currently unable to treat the case
(NL1).
The first theorem of this section is the following.
Theorem 4.6. Ifµ<µ 0andmin(1,m)α−1≥∥I∥∞(1−µ/µ 0)−1, then the stationary solution
am,αto(NF)with the response function fm,αis the solution to (NF)with the linear response
function with slope α>0. In particular, if I=IL, the nonlinear response functions (NL3)and
(NL4)do not model Billock and Tsou’s experiments.
Proof.Ifµ < µ 0thenam,α∈L∞(R2)is the unique solution to am,α=IL+µω∗fm,α(am,α)
thanks to Theorem 3.1. Recall from Theorem 3.2 that ∥am,α∥∞≤ ∥I∥∞(1−µ/µ 0)−1. If
min(1,m)α−1≥∥I∥∞(1−µ/µ 0)−1, then for a.e. x∈R2, one has
−m
α≤am,α(x)≤1
α.
Therefore,fm,α(am,α(y)) =am,α(y)for a.e.y∈R2, andam,α∈L∞(R2)solves the stationary
equation with a linear response function with slope α > 0. Finally, to prove the last part of
the theorem, it suffices to observe that ∥IL∥∞= 1and(1−µ/µ 0)−1>1, which implies that
min(1,m)>α, and then α<m≤1orα<1<m. The result then follows at once thanks to
the first part of the theorem and Theorem 4.1. □20 CYPRIEN TAMEKUE, DARIO PRANDI, AND YACINE CHITOUR
Figure 9. Summary on the ranges of parameters m≥0andα > 0where the
nonlinearity fm,αreproduces the phenomenon or not, for a funnel-like stimulus
having the cortical representation defined in (2.7). The parameters reproduce
the phenomenon in blue, and ingrey, they don’t reproduce it.
Remark 4.7. Observe that Theorem 4.6 also accounts for the case of m= 1andα<1. This
means that the odd nonlinearity f1,αof(NL2)with 0< α < 1does not model Billock and
Tsou’s experiments. It, therefore, remains to prove that the odd nonlinearity f1,αwithα≥1
does not model Billock and Tsou’s experiments.
Fortunately, for all α≥0, the odd nonlinearity f1,αof(NL2)satisfies all the hypotheses of
Proposition 3.8, taken as the response function in (NF). One, therefore, has the following result.
See, for instance, Figure 8 for a numerical visualization.
Proposition 4.8. Under the assumption µ < µ 0/2, Equation (NF)with response function
(NL2)does not reproduce Billock and Tsou’s experiments associated with a sensory input con-
sisting of a pattern of horizontal stripes localized in the left area in the cortex V1.
Proof.Given that the sensory input in Equation (NF) is a pattern consisting of horizontal
stripes localized in the left area in the cortex V1, Proposition 3.8 shows that the corresponding
stationary state consists of a mixture of patterns of horizontal and vertical stripes in the right
area in V1 instead of vertical stripes only, as Billock and Tsou reported. □
Summing up, the results in this section provide a complete theoretical investigation of Billock
and Tsou’s experiments modeling by Equation (NF) with response function fm,α, except for the
rangem̸= 1andα≥min(m,1). Although outside of the scope of this work, we observe that
thanks to Corollary 3.4, the study of this range can be reduced to considering the semilinear
response function f∞,αas defined in (2.4).
For fixed parameters σ1>0,σ2>0andκ > 0in the kernel ω, andµ > 0chosen such
thatµ < µ 0, we summarize in Figure 9 the ranges of parameters m≥0andα > 0for which
equation (NF) with the response function fm,αreproduce the phenomenon or not, for a funnel-
like stimulus having the cortical representation defined in (2.7).REPRODUCIBILITY VIA NEURAL FIELDS OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS INDUCED BY LOCALIZED STIMULI 21
5.Numerical analysis and experiments
In this section, we present a numerical scheme for the approximation of stationary solutions
of (NF) and analyze its convergence. Finally, we present some numerical experiments obtained
using this scheme.
5.1.Analysis of the numerical scheme. In this section, for the sake of generality, we assume
that the response function fsatisfies the assumptions in Definition 1. Given a sensory input
I∈L∞(R2), we compute numerical solutions an,h,M :Z2→Rdepending on three parameters
h > 0,M > 0, andn∈N. These are obtained via the following iterative procedure, where
(i,j)∈Z2:
a0,h,M(i,j) =I(ih,jh ),
an+1,h,M(i,j) =I(ih,jh ) +µh2M/summationdisplay
p,q=−Mω(ph,qh )f(an,h(i−p,j−q)).
We start by presenting the following error estimate, whose proof is quite technical and is pre-
sented in Appendix A.2.
Theorem 5.1 (Numerical error estimate) .Assume that µ<µ 0and let the sensory input Ibe
given by
I(x1,x2) =I1(x1,x2)H(θL−x1) +I2(x1,x2)H(x1−θL)
whereθL∈R, andI1,I2∈L∞(R2)are globally Lipschitz continuous. Then, for any η∈
(µ/µ 0,1)there exists h0>0such that for every h<h 0it holds
sup
(i,j)∈Z2|aI(ih,jh )−an,h,M (i,j)|=O(h) +O(ηn) +O/parenleftigg
e−M2h2
2σ2
2/parenrightigg
where theO(·)’s only depend on µ,η α,ω,∥I∥∞, and the Lipschitz constants of I1andI2.
Remark 5.2. The only part of the proof where the Lipschitz continuity assumption on the
sensory input in Theorem 5.1 is needed is to control the error introduced by the discretization of
the integral term of (NF). It is, however, easy to see that the argument of proof can be adapted
to more general sensory inputs I, under appropriate assumptions on the region where Iis not
Lipschitz continuous.
Remark 5.3. It is immediate from Theorem 5.1 that to have numerical convergence to the
exact stationary solution aI, one has to choose h→0,n→+∞, andMsuch thatMh→+∞.
To compare the zero level-set of the exact solution with their numerical approximations, we
introduce the following approximated zero level-set for aI:
Zε
aI={x∈R2||aI|<ε}, ε> 0.
In order to define a numerical approximation of the above, for a sensory input I∈L∞(R2)as
in Theorem 5.1, we let Ω±={x∈R2|±(x1−θL)>0}. Then, for (n,h,M )∈N×R+×R+,
we define
Zε,±
n,h,M={x∈Ω±|∃(i,j)∈Z2s.t.

We have the following result, which guarantees the convergence of the numerical approximations
of the zero level-set to the exact set ZaI.

h≤Cε, n≥−Clogε, M≥−Clogε
ε2. (5.4)
Proof.By Theorem 5.1, there exists (n0,h0,M0)∈N×R+×R+such that for any n > n 0,
h<h 0, andM >M 0, we have that
sup
(i,j)∈Z2|aI(ih,jh )−an,h,M (i,j)|<ε
2. (5.5)
The estimate (5.4) immediately follows choosing, e.g., η= (1 +µ/µ 0)/2. Moreover, by Lipschitz
continuity of aIonΩ+∪Ω−, which is guaranteed by Proposition 3.5, up to reducing h0(i.e.,
reducingC > 0), for all (i,j)∈Z2with (ih,jh )∈Ω±andx∈Ω±such that|x−(ih,jh )|≤h/2,
we have
|aI(x)−aI(ih,jh )|<ε
2. (5.6)
Combining (5.5) and (5.6), one easily obtains (5.3), completing the proof of the statement. □
5.2.Simulations for Billock and Tsou experiments. The numerical implementation is
obtained using the Julia toolbox from [36], which implements the numerical scheme presented
above. These experiments have been obtained with the parameters:
n= 102, h = 10−2, M = 103.
The sensory input is taken to be localized either on the left or on the right part of the cortical
space. In the first case we let I(x1,x2) = cos(2πλx 2)H(θ−x1), while in the second case
I(x1,x2) = cos(2πλx 2)H(x1−θ)forλ>0andθ>0. The choice of the input is precised in the
captions, while we collect in Table 1 the values of the parameters.
We exhibit in Figures 10 and 11 a numerical reproduction of Billock and Tsou’s experiments,
in the sense that the stripes’ frequency is similar to that used in the experiment, for a funnel-
like stimulus localized in the fovea and the peripheral visual field. In V1, we have a pattern of
black/white horizontal stripes in the left(respectively right) area in V1 and white in the right
(respectively left) area in V1. We also exhibit in Figures 12 and 13 a numerical experiment
where the stripes’ frequency is not the one of Billock and Tsou’s experiments.REPRODUCIBILITY VIA NEURAL FIELDS OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS INDUCED BY LOCALIZED STIMULI 23

Observe that each output pattern exhibited in Figures 10–13 captures all the essential features
of the after-image reported by Billock and Tsou at the level of V1. It suffices to apply the inverse
retino-cortical map to each output pattern to obtain such images at the retina level. See, for
instance, [38].
6.Concluding remarks and discussion
In this paper, we provided a mechanistic modeling of the psychophysical experiments reported
by Billock and Tsou [6] using neural dynamics of Amari-type that models the average membrane
potentialofneuronalactivityofspikingneuronsintheprimaryvisualcortex(V1). Wefocusedon
the case where intra-neural connectivity is smaller than the threshold where specific geometrical
patterns spontaneously arise in the absence of sensory input from the retina. We considered, in
particular, visual stimuli consisting of regular funnel patterns localized in the fovea or peripheral
visual field.24 CYPRIEN TAMEKUE, DARIO PRANDI, AND YACINE CHITOUR

Firstly, the retino-cortical map between the visual field and V1 allowed us to model these
visual stimuli as patterns of horizontal stripes localized in the left or right area of V1 that
we incorporated as sensory inputs in the neural fields equation. Then, through complex and
harmonic analysis tools, we have shown that when the neuronal response function of V1 is linear,
the output pattern of the equation does not capture the V1 representation of the after-images
reported by Billock and Tsou, suggesting that the phenomenon is wholly nonlinear. Next,
we dived into the study of nonlinear response functions for which the corresponding output
patterns of the equation qualitatively capture, at the level of V1, the essential features of the
after-images reported by Billock and Tsou. Through this study, we have analytically shown
that nonlinear response functions with either balanced inhibitory and excitatory influence or a
strong excitatory influence and weak slope or a strong inhibitory influence and weak slope do
not reproduce the phenomenon. This suggests that a complex interplay between excitatory and
inhibitoryinfluences[19, 35]isrequiredfortheneuralfieldsequationtomodelthepsychophysicalREPRODUCIBILITY VIA NEURAL FIELDS OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS INDUCED BY LOCALIZED STIMULI 25
observations reported by Billock and Tsou [6] for a funnel pattern visual stimulus localized either
in the fovea or peripheral visual field. Finally, we presented numerical experiments showing
that nonlinear response functions other than those enumerated previously can reproduce the
phenomenon.
While much remains to be understood about the mechanisms underlying Billock and Tsou’s
psychophysical observations, our study provides valuable insights into how the primary visual
cortex processes sensory information arising from localized regular funnel patterns in the visual
field. In particular, this study supports the experimental finding (see, e.g., [6, Experiment 3-
p. 8492 and Discussion-p. 8493]) suggesting that there is an orthogonal response in the unexcited
region of V1 as a response to simple geometrical patterns from the retina that do not fill all the
visual field or are not regular in shape.
We stress that the structure of the visual stimuli related to funnel patterns used by Billock
and Tsou at the V1 level was crucial to obtaining the results presented in this paper. The same
modeling regarding the tunnel pattern localized in the fovea or the peripheral visual field (see
[6, Fig. 3b and 3d]) will not yield the after-images reported by Billock and Tsou. Indeed, due
to the rotational invariance of these tunnel patterns, the stationary solutions induced by the
corresponding sensory inputs will be invariant with respect to translations in the second variable
of V1 (see, e.g., [37, Proposition A.1]). In particular, this excludes the possibility of a funnel-like
after-image in the unexcited region.
In this work, we have focused on time-independent visual stimuli, which turned out to be
enough to model (static) nonlocal perceptual phenomena associated with the funnel patterns
under consideration. Studying pattern formation from spatiotemporal visual stimuli would be
interesting in future work. As an open question related directly to the current study, it will
be interesting to analytically show that a nonnegative response function (as, e.g., the response
function(NL1)of Section 4.2), which models wholly excitatory or inhibitory influence, does
not reproduce the phenomenon, as suggested by the numerical simulations exhibited in [38,
Fig. 8]. Moreover, finding a systematic analytical method for explicitly studying the qualitative
properties of the output pattern (e.g., the structure of the zero level-set) would be valuable.
The starting point could be to investigate the case of the semilinear response function f∞,α
since numerical analysis arguments and simulations suggest that this nonlinearity reproduces
the phenomenon.

To estimate K1
p,q, we start by noticing that, by construction, there exists p0∈Nsuch that
K1
p,q∩{x1=θL}̸=∅if and only if p=p0. In particular, aIis Lipschitz continuous on Qp,qif
p̸=p0by Proposition 3.5, with Lipschitz constant upper-bounded by DIdefined in (3.6) where
the corresponding LIis equal to the maximum of the Lipschitz constants of I1andI2. Hence,
for every (p,q)∈Z2p̸=p0we have
|K1
p,q|≤αDIh/integraldisplay
Qp,q|ω(y)|dy.
It follows that

Finally, collecting (A.7), (A.9) and (A.24) yields the statement. □30 CYPRIEN TAMEKUE, DARIO PRANDI, AND YACINE CHITOUR
