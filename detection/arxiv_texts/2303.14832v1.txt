ABSTRACT . In this paper, we prove the Hardy-Leray inequality and rela ted inequalities
in variable Lebesgue spaces. Our proof is based on a version o f the Stein-Weiss inequal-
ity in variable Lebesgue spaces derived from two weight ineq ualities due to Melchiori
and Pradolini. We also discuss an application of our results to establish an existence
result for the degenerate p(·)-Laplace operator.
1. I NTRODUCTION AND MAIN RESULTS
In this paper we consider the problem of extending the classi cal Hardy-Leray inequal-
ity and related inequalities to the scale of variable Lebesg ue spaces. The Hardy-Leray in-
equality, sometimes referred to simply as the Hardy inequal ity, states that for 1< p <∞,
p/\e}atio\slash=n, and compactly supported smooth functions f,
/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoublef
|·|/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
Lp(Rn)≤C/ba∇dbl∇f/ba∇dblLp(Rn). (1.1)
Originally, this was proved by Hardy [ 12] in one dimension when p= 2, and extended
to higher dimensions by Leray [ 20]. This is a special case of Caffarelli, Kohn, and Niren-
berg [ 2], who proved the following general result. Given p, q≥1and exponents a, b
such that
0≤b−a≤1,−n
p< b,−n
q< a, and1
p−1
q=1
n+a−b
n,
then
/ba∇dbl|·|af/ba∇dblLq(Rn)≤C/ba∇dbl|·|b∇f/ba∇dblLp(Rn).
Note that when a=b= 0 this reduces to the classical Hardy-Sobolev inequality [ 11,
Theorem 7.10].
Similar results hold for fractional powers of the Laplacian . LetSbe the Schwartz
space of rapidly decaying smooth functions in Rn. The fractional Laplacian of a function
can be deﬁned by the following nonlocal operator in Rnfor allf∈ S,

For these and related results, see [ 1,5,6,10,15].
The variable Lebesgue spaces Lp(·)(Ω)are a generalization of the classical Lebesgue
spaces gotten by replacing the constant exponent pby an exponent function p(·) : Ω→
[1,∞). Intuitively, they consist of all the measurable functions fthat satisfy
/integraldisplay
Ω|f(x)|p(x)dx <∞.
These functions form a Banach function space when equipped w ith the Luxemburg norm

These spaces have been studied for many years; one of the orig inal motivations was the
study PDEs and the calculus of variations over these functio n spaces. For more details,
see [3,7,26] and the references they contain.
Because of this, there has been considerable work done in pro ving Hardy-type inequal-
ities in the variable Lebesgue spaces. A one-dimensional ve rsion of Hardy’s inequality
was ﬁrst obtained by Kokilashvili and Samko in [ 18]. The one-dimensional case was
also considered in the papers [ 8] and [ 21]. In higher dimensions, for a bounded domain
Ω, in [13] the authors proved that
/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoublef
δ(·)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
Lp(·)(Ω)≤C/ba∇dbl∇f/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω),
whereδ(x) = dist(x,∂Ω). OnRnand on bounded domains, the Hardy-Sobolev inequal-
ity
/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblq(·)≤ /ba∇dbl∇f/ba∇dblp(·),
where1

nfor allx, has been studied by a number of authors: see [ 3, Sec-
tion 6.4] for details and references.
In this paper, we prove the Hardy-Leray inequality and relat ed results on the variable
Lebesgue spaces over Rn. We will state our main results here, but for brevity we will
defer the deﬁnition of our notation (which is standard) to th e next section. Our ﬁrst result
is a generalization of inequality ( 1.1).HARDY-LERAY INEQUALITIES IN V ARIABLE LEBESGUE SPACES 3
Theorem 1.1 (Hardy-Leray inequality) .Givenp(·)∈ P(Rn), ifp(·)∈LH(Rn)and

p(·)≤C/ba∇dbl∇f/ba∇dblp(·),
whereCis a positive constant independent of f.
Remark 1.2. By using the theory of variable exponent Sobolev spaces, the se results can
be extended to functions fwhose (weak) gradient ∇f∈Lp(·)(Rn). Here and below we
leave these extensions to the interested reader.
Theorem 1.1is a special case of the following result.
Theorem 1.3 (Hardy-Sobolev inequality) .Fix exponents p(·), q(·)∈ P(Rn)such that
p(·), q(·)∈LH(Rn),1< p−≤p+<∞,1< q−≤q+<∞, andp(x)≤q(x)for all
x∈Rn. Given constants a, bthat satisfy

0(Rn),
/ba∇dbl|·|af/ba∇dblq(·)≤C/ba∇dbl|·|b∇f/ba∇dblp(·), (1.3)
whereCis a positive constant independent of f.
Remark 1.4. If we setp(·) =q(·),b= 0 anda=−1in Theorem 1.3, we immediately
get Theorem 1.1. Note that these inequalities were studied in [ 25] in generalized grand
Lebesgue spaces.
Remark 1.5. Whena=b= 0, Theorem 1.3becomes the version of the Hardy-Sobolev
inequality in variable Lebesgue spaces proved in [ 3, Section 6.4]. However, there this
theorem included the case p−= 1; the proof depended on weighted norm inequalities in
the constant exponent case, the theory of Rubio de Francia ex trapolation and a technique
due to Maz’ya. It is an open question whether Theorem 1.3can be extended to include
the casep−= 1.
As a consequence of Theorem 1.3, or more precisely, by adapting its proof, we prove a
weighted Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality in the variable L ebesgue spaces. In the constant
exponent case, this result was studied in [ 27,28]. For related results without weights,
see [3, Section 6.5.10].

We can also prove Poincar´ e-type inequalities analogous to the inequalities in Theo-
rem 1.3. Given a set Ωsuch that 0<|Ω|<∞and a locally integrable function f,

p(·), q(·)∈ P(Ω)such that p(·), q(·)∈LH(Ω),1< p−≤p+<∞,1< q−≤q+<∞,
andp(x)≤q(x)for allx∈Rn. Given constants a, bthat satisfy

whereCis a positive constant independent of f.
Remark 1.8. The assumption that p(·), q(·)∈LH(Ω)can be replaced with the seem-
ingly stronger assumption that p(·), q(·)∈LH(Rn), since log-H ¨older continuous func-
tions on any set Ωcan be extended to functions in LH(Rn): See [ 3, Lemma 2.4].
Remark 1.9. Whenp(·) =q(·)anda=b= 0, this result was proved in [ 3, Theo-
rem 6.21], but again, this result included the case p−= 1.
Our next results are the analogous theorems for the fraction al Laplacian.

Theorem 1.10 is a special case of the following result.
Theorem 1.11 (Fractional Hardy-Sobolev inequality) .Fixs∈[0,1]. Givenp(·), q(·)∈
P(Rn), suppose that p(·), q(·)∈LH(Rn),1< p−≤p+<∞,1< q−≤q+<∞, and

Finally, by adapting the proof of Theorem 1.3, we prove a weighted fractional Gagliardo-
Nirenberg inequality in the variable Lebesgue spaces. Even in the constant exponent case,
this result appears to be new.HARDY-LERAY INEQUALITIES IN V ARIABLE LEBESGUE SPACES 5

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Secti on2we gather some basic
deﬁnitions and results about variable Lebesgue spaces that we will need. The heart of
the proofs of our main results is a generalization of the Stei n-Weiss theorem for the frac-
tional integral operator to the scale of variable Lebesgue s paces, which is of independent
interest. We state and prove this result in Section 3. In Section 4we give the proofs of
Theorems 1.1–1.12. Finally, in Section 5we give an application of our results: we show
that a Neumann-type problem for the degenerate operator
Lu=−div(|/radicalbig
Q∇u|p(·)−2Q∇u)
has a solution. This operator has been studied previously in [4,16,17,19]. It is a general-
ization of the p(·)-Laplacian
∆p(·)u=−div(|∇u|p(·)−2∇u),
which arises in the calculus of variations as an example of no nstandard growth conditions,
and has been studied by a number of authors: see [ 9,14,23,26] and the references they
contain.
Throughout this paper, nwill denote the dimension of the underlying space Rn. By
a constant Cwe will mean a value that may depend on the underlying paramet ers (such
as the exponent functions) but not on a particular function f. Its value may change from
line to line. Sometimes, we will write A/lessorsimilarBinstead of A≤cB. IfA/lessorsimilarBandB/lessorsimilarA,
we will write A≈B.
2. P ROPERTIES OF VARIABLE LEBESGUE SPACES
In this section we give some basic deﬁnitions and properties of variable Lebesgue
spaces. For proofs and further information, see [ 3, Chapter 2].
Given a set Ω⊂Rn, letP(Ω)be the set of all Lebesgue measurable functions, denoted
byp(·), such that p(·) : Ω→[1,∞]. The functions p(·)are referred to as exponent
functions. Given p(·)∈ P(Ω)and a setE⊂Ω, deﬁne
p−(E) = essinf
x∈Ep(x), p+(E) = esssup
x∈Ep(x).
If the domain is clear we will simply write p−=p−(Ω),p+=p+(Ω).6 D. CRUZ-URIBE AND D. SURAGAN
Givenp(·)∈ P(Rn), deﬁne the conjugate exponent p′(·)pointwise by1

with the conventions that 1/∞= 0 and1/0 =∞. The following identities follow at
once from the deﬁnition:
(p′(·))+= (p−)′,(p′(·))−= (p+)′.
Givenp(·)∈ P(Ω), we say that it belongs to the class of locally log-H¨ older co ntinuous
exponents LH0(Ω), denoted by p(·)∈LH0(Ω), if there exists a constant C0such that
|p(x)−p(y)| ≤C0
−log(|x−y|)
for allx,y∈Ωwith|x−y|<1

that are log-H¨ older continuous at inﬁnity, LH∞(Ω), denoted by p(·)∈LH∞(Ω), if there
exists a constant C∞andp∞such that
|p(x)−p∞| ≤C∞

tional (or simply the modular) associated with p(·)by

whereΩ∞={x∈Ω :p(x) =∞}. If|Ω∞|= 0, in particular when p+<∞,
/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblL∞(Ω∞)= 0; when|Ω\Ω∞|= 0, thenρp(·),Ω(f) =/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblL∞(Ω∞). In situations where
there is no ambiguity we will simply write ρp(·)(f)orρ(f).
DeﬁneLp(·)(Ω)to be the set of Lebesgue measurable functions fsuch that ρ(f/λ)<

/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω)= inf/braceleftbig

.
If the set on the righthand side is empty deﬁne /ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω)=∞. If there is no ambiguity
over the domain Ω, we will often write /ba∇dblf/ba∇dblp(·)instead of /ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω). Whenp(·)equals a
constantp, thenLp(·)(Ω)is equal to the classical Lebesgue space Lp(Ω)and/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω)=
/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp(Ω).
The functional /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω)is a norm, and equipped with this norm, Lp(·)(Ω)is a Banach
function space. Given τ≥1, the norm satisﬁes the rescaling property that for τ >1,
/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLτp(·)(Ω)=/ba∇dbl|f|τ/ba∇dblτ
Lp(·)(Ω). (2.1)
It also satisﬁes a generalized H¨ older inequality: given p(·), q(·), r(·)∈ P(Ω)such that
for allx∈Ω,
1
r(x)=1

q(x),
then there exists a constant Csuch that for all f∈Lp(·)(Ω)andg∈Lq(·)(Ω),
/ba∇dblfg/ba∇dblLr(·)(Ω)≤C/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω)/ba∇dblg/ba∇dblLq(·)(Ω). (2.2)
Ifp(·)∈LH(Ω), then for every cube Q⊂Ωwe can estimate the norm of the charac-
teristic function of QinLp(·)(Ω)by

3. T HESTEIN -WEISS INEQUALITY IN VARIABLE LEBESGUE SPACES
At the heart of the proofs of our main results is an applicatio n of the theory of weighted
norm inequalities in the variable Lebesgue spaces. We make u se of the following rela-
tionships between the gradient, the fractional Laplacian a nd the Riesz potentials. Given
0< α < n , deﬁne the Riesz potential Iαto be the integral operator
Iαf(x) =/integraldisplay

It is well-known (see, for instance, [ 30]) thatIα:Lp(Rn)→Lq(Rn), whenever 1<

n. The analogous inequality holds in the variable Lebesgue sp aces:
see [3, Chapter 5].
The connection between the Riesz potential and the gradient is given by two inequali-
ties. The ﬁrst is
|f(x)|/lessorsimilarI1(|∇f|)(x), (3.1)
which holds for all f∈C∞
0(Rn). The second holds given any bounded, convex domain
Ωandx∈Ω:
|f(x)−/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ| ≤I1(|∇f|χΩ)(x). (3.2)
(See [ 3,11].) Similarly, by the deﬁnition of the fractional Laplacian and the properties of
the Fourier transform, we have that for s∈[0,1],
I2s((−∆)sf)(x) =f(x). (3.3)
We exploit these estimates using the following result, whic h is a generalization of the
classical Stein-Weiss inequality [ 31] to the variable Lebesgue spaces.
Theorem 3.1. Fix0< α < n . Givenp(·), q(·)∈ P(Rn), suppose that p(·), q(·)∈
LH(Rn),1< p−≤p+<∞,1< q−≤q+<∞, andp(x)≤q(x)for allx∈Rn.
Given constants a, bthat satisfy

Then for all fsuch that |·|bf∈Lp(·)(Rn),
/ba∇dbl|·|aIαf/ba∇dblq(·)≤C/ba∇dbl|·|bf/ba∇dblp(·).
We will prove Theorem 3.1as a consequence of a more general, two weight norm
inequality in variable Lebesgue spaces due to Melchiori and Pradolini [ 22, Theorem 1.1].
By a weight wwe mean a non-negative, locally integrable function that sa tisﬁes0<

To prove Theorem 3.1we need one lemma.

Proof. First assume that dist(Q,0)≤ℓ(Q). In this case there exists a ball BQ=

Proof of Theorem 3.1.We need to show that if we let u(x) =|x|aandv(x) =|x|b, then
with our hypotheses on a, bandp(·), q(·), the condition ( 3.6) holds. Our ﬁrst step is to
replace this condition with a simpler one. Since p(·),q(·)∈LH(Rn), if we apply ( 2.3) toHARDY-LERAY INEQUALITIES IN V ARIABLE LEBESGUE SPACES 9
the norm of each characteristic function, and rewrite the no rms of the weights in terms of
Lebesgue spaces norms, we get that it is equivalent to assumi ng that for some r, s >1,

(We note in passing that this condition should be compared to the result of Perez [ 24] in
the constant exponent case.)
Fix a cube Q. We ﬁrst choose r, s >1such that
/integraldisplay
Q|x|arq+dx <∞,/integraldisplay
Q|x|−bs(p−)′dx <∞.
This is possible by assumption ( 3.4).
Now suppose ﬁrst that dist(Q,0)≤ℓ(Q). Then by Lemma 3.3, the lefthand side of
(3.7) is bounded above by.

However, if we take the integral average of ( 3.5) over the cube Q, we get that
α

qQ−1
pQ+a−b
n= 0.
Therefore, for all such cubes, the lefthand side of ( 3.7) is uniformly bounded.
Now suppose that dist(Q,0)≥ℓ(Q). Then the lefthand side of ( 3.7) is bounded above
by
|cQ|α+n
qQ−n
pQ|cQ|a|cQ|−b=|cQ|α+n
qQ−n
pQ+a−b.
But arguing as above we must have that the exponent on the righ thand side is equal to 0,
and so again lefthand side of ( 3.7) is uniformly bounded for all such cubes. Therefore,
(3.7) holds, and so by Theorem 3.2we get the desired inequality for Iα. /square
Remark 3.4. In the proof of Theorem 3.1we do not actually use the hypothesis a≤b.
However, if the opposite inequality holds, then ( 3.5) implies that

In the constant exponent case, it is known that in this case th e weighted norm inequality
only holds in the trivial case when u(x) = 0 whenever v(x)<∞(see the remarks
after [ 29, Theorem 1]).
4. P ROOFS OF THE MAIN RESULTS
We can now prove our main results. As we noted in the Introduct ion, Theorem 1.1is a
special case of Theorem 1.3.
Proof of Theorem 1.3.Fixf∈C∞
c(Rn). Then
/ba∇dbl|·|af/ba∇dblq(·)≤C/ba∇dbl|·|aI1(|∇f|)/ba∇dblq(·)≤C/ba∇dbl|·|b∇f/ba∇dblp(·);
the ﬁrst inequality follows from ( 3.1) and the second from our hypotheses and Theo-
rem3.1withα= 1. /square10 D. CRUZ-URIBE AND D. SURAGAN
Proof of Theorem 1.6.Fixf∈C∞
c(Rn). Then by H¨ older’s inequality ( 2.2) and the
rescaling property ( 2.1),
/ba∇dbl|·|af/ba∇dblr(·)≤C/ba∇dbl|·|af/ba∇dblθ
p∗(·)/ba∇dbl|·|af/ba∇dbl1−θ
q(·).
By inequality ( 3.1) and by Theorem 3.1withα= 1,a=bandq(·) =p∗(·), which we
can apply because of our hypotheses,
/ba∇dbl|·|af/ba∇dblp∗(·)≤C/ba∇dbl|·|aI1(|∇f)/ba∇dblp∗(·)≤C/ba∇dbl|·|a∇f/ba∇dblp(·).
If we combine these two estimates we get the desired result. /square
Proof of Theorem 1.7.The proof is nearly the same as the proof of Theorem 1.3. As we
noted in Remark 1.8, we may assume without loss of generality that p(·), q(·)∈LH(Rn).
Deﬁner(·)∈LH(Rn)by
1
p(x)−1
r(x)=1
n+a−b
n.
Thenq(x)≤r(x), so we can deﬁne the exponent s(·)by
1
q(x)=1
s(x)+1
r(x).
By the generalized H¨ older inequality,
/ba∇dbl|·|a[f−/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ]/ba∇dblLq(·)(Ω)≤ /ba∇dbl|·|a[f−/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ]/ba∇dblLr(·)(Ω)/ba∇dblχΩ/ba∇dblLs(·)(Ω)
=C(Ω,s(·))/ba∇dbl|·|a[f−/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ]/ba∇dblLr(·)(Ω).
By inequality ( 3.2) and Theorem 3.1,
/ba∇dbl|·|a[f−/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ]/ba∇dblLr(·)(Ω)≤ /ba∇dbl|·|aI1(|∇f|χΩ)]/ba∇dblLr(·)(Ω)≤C/ba∇dbl|·|b∇f/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω).
If we combine these inequalities we get the desired result. /square
As we noted in the Introduction, Theorem 1.10 is a special case of Theorem 1.11 with
a= 2s,b= 0, andp(·) =q(·).
Proof of Theorem 1.11.The proof is essentially the same as the proof of Theorem 1.3,
but we use ( 3.3) instead of ( 3.1), and apply Theorem 3.1withα= 2s. /square
Proof of Theorem 1.12.The proof is essentially the same as the proof of Corollary 1.6
but again using ( 3.3) and Theorem 3.1withα= 2s,a=bandq(·) =ps(·). /square
5. S OLUTIONS TO A DEGENERATE p(·)-LAPLACIAN
In this section we give an application of Theorem 1.7to show the existence of solutions
to a degenerate Neumann-type problem studied in [ 4]. LetΩbe a bounded, open domain
inRn, and letQbe ann×nself-adjoint, positive-semi-deﬁnite matrix function deﬁ ned
on an open neighborhood of ¯Ω, and letvbe a non-negative, locally integrable function
also deﬁned on an open neighborhood of ¯Ω. We are interested in the existence of weak
solutions to the problem

wherenis the outward unit normal vector of ∂Ω. The precise deﬁnition of a weak
solution is somewhat technical, and we refer the reader to [ 4] for complete details. (We
note in passing that this deﬁnition extends to the case when Ωhas a rough boundary and
the unit normal is not well-deﬁned.)
In [4] the authors showed that if 1< p−≤p+<∞,v,/ba∇dbl/radicalbig
Q(·)|op∈Lp(·)(Ω), where
for eachx∈Ω|/radicalbig
Q(x)|opis the operator norm of the matrix/radicalbig
Q(x), then the existence
of a solution to ( 5.1) was equivalent to the existence of a degenerate Poincar´ e i nequality
of the form
/ba∇dblv[f−/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ,v]/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω)≤C/ba∇dbl/radicalbig
Q∇f/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω), (5.2)
where
/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ,v=1

Ωf(x)v(x)dx.
By using this result and Theorem 1.7we can show that solutions exist when vis a power
weight and the smallest eigenvalue of Qis bounded below by a power weight.
Theorem 5.1. Fix an exponent p(·)∈ P(Ω)such that 1< p−≤p+<∞andp(·)∈
LH(Ω). Leta, b∈Rbe such that

LetQbe a self-adjoint, positive semi-deﬁnite matrix function s uch that|√Q|op∈Lp(·)(Ω),
and for all x∈Ωandξ∈Rn,
c|x|b|ξ| ≤ |/radicalbig
Q(x)ξ|.
Letv(x) =|x|a. Then there exists a solution to the Neumann-type problem ( 5.1).
Proof. By [4, Theorem 1.8] the existence of solutions follows immediate ly if we have
thatv∈Lp(·)(Ω)and the Poincar´ e inequality ( 5.2) holds. The ﬁrst is immediate: since Ω
is bounded, by [ 3, Corollary 2.48],
/ba∇dbl|·|a/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω)≤(1+|Ω|)/ba∇dbl|·|a/ba∇dblLp+(Ω)<∞;
the ﬁnal inequality follows from our assumptions on a. To prove the Poincar´ e inequality,
note ﬁrst that by H¨ older’s inequality in the variable Lebes gue spaces,
|/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ−/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ,v|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1

v(Ω)/ba∇dblf−/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω).
Therefore, by Theorem 1.7and our assumptions on Q,
/ba∇dbl|·|a[f−/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ,v]/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω)≤C/ba∇dbl|·|a[f−/a\}b∇acketle{tf/a\}b∇acket∇i}htΩ]/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω)
≤C/ba∇dbl|·|b∇f/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω)
≤C/ba∇dbl/radicalbig
Q∇f/ba∇dblLp(·)(Ω).
/square
It is straightforward to construct nontrivial examples of e xponents p(·)and matrices Q
for which solutions to ( 5.1) exist. For instance, in R3letΩ =B(0,1),a=−3/4, and12 D. CRUZ-URIBE AND D. SURAGAN
b= 1/4. Letp(·)∈ P(B(0,1))be any log-H¨ older continuous function such that p−= 2
andp+= 3. If we deﬁne
Q(x) =
|x|−3
40 0
0|x|−1
40
0 0 |x|1
4
,
then it is immediate that the hypotheses of Theorem 5.1are satisﬁed.
