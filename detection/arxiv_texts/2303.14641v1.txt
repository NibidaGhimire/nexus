Abstract  
Due to the shorter channel length allowing faster ion/charge movement, nanoscale molecular thin films can 
be attractive electronic components for next -generation high -performing energy storage devices. However, 
controlling chemical functionalization and achieving stable electrode -molecule interfaces at th e nanoscale via 
covalent functionalization for low -voltage operational, ultrafast charging/discharging remains a challenge. 
Herein, we present a simple, controllable, scalable, low -cost, and versatile electrochemical grafting approach 
to modulate chemical and electronic properties of graphite rods (GRs) that are extracted from low -cost 
EVEREADY cells (1.5 US $ for 10 cells of 1.5 V). On the ANT -modified GR (ANT/GR), the total capacitance 
unveils 350 -fold enhancement as compared to an unmodified GR tested wi th 0.1 M H 2SO 4 electrolyte ensured 
by both potentiostatic and galvanostatic measurements. Such enhancement in capacitance is attributed to the 
contribution from the electrical double layer and Faradaic charge transfer. Due to higher conductivity,  
anthracene molecular layers possess more azo groups ( -N=N -) over pyrene, and naphthalene molecular films 
during the electrochemical grafting , which is  key to capacitance improvements . The ultra -low-loading 
nanofilms expose high  surface area leading to extremely high energy density. The nanoscale molecular films 
(~ 23 nm thickness) show exceptional galvanostatic charge -discharge cycling stability (10,000) that operates 
at low potential. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed along with the DC measurements  
to unravel in -depth charge storage performances. Electrochemically grafted molecular films on GR show 
excellent balance in capacitance and electrical conductivity, high diffusion coefficient toward ferrocene, and 
can easily be synthesized in good yield on rigid to flexible electrodes. The polyaromatic -based molecular 
nano -films serve as a remarkable benchmark that holds the potential to replace the traditional inorganic metal 
oxide -based electrodes and build up next -generation molecular power banks.

 1. Introduction  
The increasing global population and depletion of fossil fuels have raised significant demands for 
technological gear, especially in portable, and lightweight energy storage systems.1,2 To meet ever -expanding 
energy storage requirements, organic supercapacitors devices have been expanding but it is vital to elevate the 
energy density and power density. Excellent ability to synthesize, light -weight, low -production cost, tunable 
electrical  conductivity, porosity, and sustainable organic electrodes easy fabrication under ambient conditions 
make organic supercapacitors  for advanced technological solutions for storing electrical energies in different 
forms.3–6 Thanks to the heteroatoms (N, P, O, S) due to their relatively larger electronegativity than carbon, 
thus increase surface wettability, alter the Fermi energy (E F), and enhance capacitive performance upon 
functionalization on carbon electrodes.7,8 Generally, the energy density of OSC can be improved either by 
broadening the operational voltage window (which also depends on the nature of the electrolyte) or increasing 
the specific capacitance of electrode materials by com bining electrical double -layer capacitance ( EDLC ) and 
pseudocapacitance.9 Over the last decades, either organic or inorganic “nanomaterials” have playe d significant 
roles in electrical energy storage applications.10,11 In addition to the advantages of high -surface -area, the 
critical size of energy storing materials shrinks to nanoscale dimension (~1 -100 n m length) thus diffusion 
length gets reduced compared to the bulk, which fastens the charging -discharging, increases the cycle life, 
and lowers the operational bias, thus enhancing overall supercapacitor performances.12 All these advantages 
clearly illustrate that  the nanoscale structural design and chemistry of modified organic electrodes may provide 
a new generation of devices that can address the theoretical limit for elec trochemical storage and can 
emancipate electrical energy efficiently and rapidly.13 Among the promising candidates, graphite rod (GR) 
has been extensively exploited in dry cells and electrochemical supercapacitors due to its high doubl e-layer 
capacitance and lower cost; however, it suffers from very low energy density and lower cyclic stability.14–16 
In conjunction with the emergence of these nanostructured carbon materials, there has been a surge of interest 
in controlling surface physical and chemical properties by covalent surf ace modifications.17–19 Most covalent 
surface modifications do not deliver spatial control in the nanoscale dimension, which is highly desirable for 
developing an efficient charge storage system. Such covalent surface functionalization is challenging and 
sometimes rely on high -energy reagents and harsh reaction conditions that making uncontrollable 
nanostructures.4,20–22 To address this issue, electrochemical reduction of aryl diazonium is the most efficient 
approach as it can create strong, stable, robust covalent bonding between the molecule and the substrates, 
especially with carbon for multi -purpose usages.23–26 Though surface modification of carbon materials by 
spontaneous reduction of diazonium has already been studied in energy storage.27,28 However, the technique 
does not provide a controlled, homogeneous nanoscale multilayer film and requires longer time. For that 
reason, we have opted a simple, less time -consuming bottom -up approach to modify graphite rod (GR) with 
high surf ace area, and nitrogen -rich graphene structures formed via electrochemical reduction of diazonium 
salts of three different compounds, 1 -amino anthracene (ANT), naphthalene (NAPH) and pyrene (PYR) and 3 
 electrochemical capacitance performances compared with e ach molecular layer. So far, very few reports are 
made  with E -Chem modification in energy storage. The ANT -modified GR shows not only high charge 
storage density but also long cycle life of up to 104. In addition, we have reused the used graphite rods from  
commercially available EVEREADY low -cost cells for electrochemical supercapacitor studies upon growing 
nanoscale molecular films, which also reveals excellent charge storage compared to the unmodified one.  The 
present study comprises low -cost materials that can be easily scaled up to fabricate high -capacity energy 
systems for practical applications in molecular energy storage at the nanoscale and the concept of ‘waste to 
energy’ can be viable.  
2. Result and discussion  
The synthesis and characterization of respective diazonium salts are discussed in supporting information ( Fig. 
S1-S4, Table S1 ) which are used for t he growth of molecular layers  on graphite rod (GR) by electrochemical 
reduction method.  Being highly reactive, generated at the electrode surface, aryl  radicals covalently bonded 
graphite rod used as working electrodes and extended with a repeated number of cyclic voltammograms (CVs) 
scans , keeping potential window unchanged.  Continuous binding of (for instances, ANT) radicals ma intains 
the growth of anthracene molecular layers along with azo groups ( −N=N −) as bridges. However, though 
previous studies on E -Chem grafted molecular layers utilized for hybrid supercapacitors studies, but none of 
the work highlights such unexpected azo  formation during E-Chem  grafting. Non -radical formation of azo 
bridges between layers is one of the main assumptions to explain the layer growth other than radical 
polymerization ( Fig 1a , inset shows graphitic rod ). Fig 1b  shows the potentiostatic  cyclic vo ltammograms  
(CVs)  scans (1 -20 cycles) of electrochemical modification of GR su bstrate with 5 mM of ANT -D in 
acetonitrile  recorded at 100 mV/s scan rate using 0.1 M n-tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate ( TBAP ) as a 
supporting electrolyte . CV shows the two reduction peaks: a broad irreversible reduction peak at −0.25 V vs. 
Ag/AgNO 3 was observed during the first scan indicating the reduction of anthracene diazonium salts (ANT -
D), and a higher cathodic peak indicating formation of ANT radical to ANT anion . To determine thickness of 
ANT layers, ANT -D was E -Chem grafted on indium tin ox ide (ITO) substrate with the same electrochemical  
parameters  used for GR modification . AFM  image of ANT film and t hickness of the film was evaluated by 
scratching the ANT films with a sharp needle and 23 ± 0.8 nm thickness was obtained from depth analysis  
(Fig S 5-S6). Amorphous  nature of the bare graphite rod and ANT -modified GR was analyzed by X-ray 
diffraction ( XRD ) studies  (Fig 1c , S7). The diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 26. 5, 42.4, 44.5, 54.5, 77. 5, and 
83.6° corresponding to the (002), (100), (101), (004), (103), and (110) planes of hexagonal graphite with 
P63/mmc space group (JCPDS 00 -008-0415) , were observed for both. Field-emission scanning electron 
microscopy ( FE-SEM ) image of bare GR shows micrometer -sized flake -like structure s (Fig S 8), while 
ANT/GR shows increased roughness , indicating growth of  molecular films (Fig 1d ). The Raman spectra of 
bare GR and ANT/GR show a strong D -band at  1351 cm─1, a G -band at around 1583 cm─1, and a strong 2D -
band around 2705 cm─1 (Fig 2a , S9). The D band is observed due to the  breathing mode of k-point phonons 4 
 of A 1g symmetry of the porous carbon, which also reveals the presence of defect sites, impurities, and disorder 
in the structure.29,30 The I D/IG ratio was 0.12  and 0.36 for bare GR  and ANT/GR,  respectively,  indicating 
increased disorders in ANT/GR. The G band represents the E 2g phonon of sp2 carbon atoms and corresponds 
to the ordered sp2 hybridized graphene network.31 The 2D peak was observed at about 2700 cm─1, caused by 
the second -order vibration of two phonons with opposite wavevectors.31 The expended and deconvoluted x-
ray photoelectron  spectra of the C1s peak in bare GR were deconvoluted into two peaks,  one at  284.6 eV  for 
C═C  and the other at 285.6 eV , corresponding to C─C  (Fig 2b ).

The expended and fitted XPS spectr a of C1s of ANT/GR show three contributions at 284.5 eV, 284.9 eV , and 
285.7 eV for C═C, C─C , and C─N, respectively  (Fig 2c , S10) which are well -correlated with the previous 
report .32 The presence of nitrogen was observed in ANT/GR ; but absent  in bare GR ( Fig S 11). In ANT/GR, 
two broad peak s in the range of 398 eV to 402 eV  were obtained , which were further deconvol uted into five 
peaks at 398.6 eV, 399.5 eV, 400. 4 eV, 402.2 eV , and 402. 8 eV suggesting the presence of five types of  Ns at 
pyridinic N, pyrolytic N, graphitic N, quaternary N , and N─N, respectively ,33 thus confirming the stacking of 
ANT rings with azo bridges  and forming  nitrogen -rich GR structures . The binding energy of ele ments in both 
bare GR and ANT/GR electrode s are given in Table S2 . The BET surface area was evaluated by measuring 
the N 2 adsorption -desorption isotherm , and pore volume was calculated using the DFT simulation . The 
isotherms were of Type -III, indicating multilayer formation  where the mesopores and macropores were not 
completely filled . The adsorption -desorption hysteresis was H3 -type hysteresis suggesting a plate -like 
structure of bare GR and ANT/GR, which was also evident from FE -SEM and the  existence of inkbottle  and 
5 
 slit-shaped pores  (Fig S1 2). The bare GR had a very low specific surface area of 2.05 m2/g and a pore volume 
of 0.004 cc/g , while it increase s (2.41 m2/g) and pore volume (0.006 cc/g) with ANT/GR. A 20% increase in 
surface area and pore volume is potentially due to the growth of highly porous GR.  Fig S1 3 presents 
mesopores as most of the pore size distribution lies in the range of 10 -50 nm with a slight contribution of 
macropores.

GR, C1s of ANT/GR, and N1s of ANT/GR, respectively.   
 
Fig 3a  shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of bare GR and ANT -modified GR recorded in 0.1 M H 2SO 4 
(three electrodes set -up) at two different scan rates (C Vs at other scan rate s are shown in Fig S1 4). In c ontrast 
to bare GR, the ANT/GR electrodes exhibited a well -defined faradaic feature at about + 0.31 V vs. Ag/AgCl , 
which can be ascribed to protonation/deprotonation of nitrogen present in the molecular films (similar to the 
redox phenomena), also capable o f ultrafast charging/discharging . An increase in the peak -to-peak separation 
(ΔEp) was observed as  a function of the scan rate , which is used to determine the apparent rate constant , kapp, 
using  Laviron formalism.34 At slower scan rates (≤ 100 mV/s), Δ Ep remains constant in the 50-53 mV range  
but increases at higher scan rates . Fig S 15 shows the trumpet plot f or ANT/GR in 0.1 M H 2SO 4 solution  
allowing  the charge transfer coefficient , α, and 1 −α calculated at 0.35 and 0.36 , respectively . The kapp of 
anodic reaction and cathodic reaction calculated at 14.9 ±0.8 and 14.0±0.6  s-1, respectively , indicative of a 
fast-charge transfers  process  (see SI for  detailed calculation ) and nearly 10 times higher than the self-
assembled  organic redox active species .35,36  Moreover , the reversible redox behavior  of bare GR and ANT/GR 
electrodes  was observed in presence of  ferrocene , a well-known redox marker37 (Fig S 16). The diffusion  
6 
 coefficient, D related to the electrochemical  nature of the charge transfer process , was deduced using the well-
known  Randles Sevcik equation ( 1).38 
                  ip = 2.695 ×105 A D1/2 n3/2 υ1/2 C                                                (1) 
The anodic and cathodic current s were plotted as a function of  the square root of the scan rate  (ia vs. υ1/2) (Fig 
S17). From the slope of  the plot , the diffusion coeffi cient (D) of ferrocene was  calculated to be 4. 2 ± 0.18  ×10-
5 cm2/s for bare GR and 5.6 ± 0.44 ×10-5 cm2/s for ANT/GR electrodes, ensuring the facile formation of 
ferrocene -ferricinium species at the electrode surfaces.37 The CVs of ANT -modified GR were recorded  with 
varying electrolyte temperature s, and the activation energy (E a) was calculated to be 10.5 (±0.4) kJ/mol ( Fig 
S18). The modified GR  electrode show excellent thermal stability, heated at 75°C for 12 h  (Fig S 19). The 
total capacitance was further determined and compared for both systems by integrating the surface area 
obtained  by the  CVs in 0.1 M H 2SO 4 electrolyte  and compared with naphthalene (NAPH) and pyrene (PYR) 
films  (Fig S20-21). Bare GR show s electrochemical double layer capacitance  (EDLC)  of 24 ± 1.36  µF cm-2 
measured at a scan rate of  500 mV/s , which agrees well  with typical carbon material s.39 However, the ANT /GR 
electrode  exhibit s higher total areal capacitance s with a  well-defined  faradaic feature  at ~ 0.31 V vs. Ag/AgCl , 
thus illustrati ng the pseudo -capacitive behavior of the interface . As confirmed by XPS spectra , nitrogen of 
azo groups  create several electroactive sites for pseudocapacitive reactions and  protonation/deprotonation in 
response to electrochemical bias . A bar diagram  is also shown in Fig 3b to compare the total areal capacitance 
of all modified active electrodes at a 500 mV/s scan rate  showing the huge increase of the capacitance for the 
ANT/GR electrode . Generally, the total capacitance can be parted into two regimes, (i) EDLC and (ii) Faradaic 
reaction of active material. However, n ot all Faradaic reactions are pseudocapacitive in nature. Few are 
controlled by ion diffusion in the active electrode material including in the electrolytes.40 Hence, it is necessary 
to evaluate the domina nt Faradaic capacitive and non -capacitive contribution in order to impel  an adequate  
explanation of the working performance of the active ele ctrode. As shown in equation 2, the power law 
relationship can be used to distinguish the dominant charge storage process, where i is current at a particular 
voltage, υ is scan rate, and  a and b are constant.41 The measured current fits linearly with the log (i) vs. log(υ) 
plot providing the b value from the slope. Values of b = 0.5 suggest, the direct  relation  of current  with the 
square root of the scan rate and followin g the traditional diffusion -controlled approach. On the contrary, b = 
1 implies the direct relation of current with the scan rate, which is the hallmark of a capacitor like charge 
storage behaviour.41  CVs from low to high scan rates were used to calculate b values at the maxima anodic 
(Fig 3c ) and cathodic regime  (Fig S 24). The linear fit in all three regions displayed a b value close to 1, 
indicating that the dominant charge transport mechanism in ANT/GR electrode is capacitor -like.  
                                                                                𝑖 (v)=𝑎 𝜗𝑏                                (2) 
Further, capacitive contribution to the total current was evaluated by using  the Dunn equation, shown below  
in equation  3, where i is current at a fixed potential, k 1υ and k 2υ0.5 relates  to capacitive and diffusion 
contributions to the total current.41,42 7 
                                                                         i (v) = k 1υ + k 2υ0.5                                       (3) 
 
Thus, k 1 was calculated using the above equ ation at slow scan rates (5 mV/s to 50 mV/s) , and 83% capacitive 
contribution was obtained at a 30 mV/s scan rate , as shown in Fig 3 d-e. Further, the capacitive contribution 
was also calculated at different scan rates. With the increase in scan rates, the percentage of capacitive 
contribution also increase s due to the slow diffusion of ions  (Fig 3 f). The high capacitive contribution further 
claimed the fast redox reaction of ANT/GR electrode , which is highly desirable of pseudocapacitive materials .

The capacitance performances  were further evaluated from galvanostatic  charge/ discharge (GCD) cycling 
over potential ranges of −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl  to + 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl ) at 30 µA  cm-2 for ten cycles  (Fig 4 a-
b). Bare GR demonstrated a symmetrical and  nearly triangular shape charge/discharge cycle, clear ly indicative 
of EDLC feature. In contrast, a significant change in shape with a negligible potential drop, Vdrop (equivalent 
series resistance /ESR  of 0.98 ± 0. 02 mΩ .cm2, Fig. 4c) was observed in ANT/GR which is the combined 
EDLC, and Faradaic contribution (protonation/deprotonation to nitrogen) in the capacitance, as depicted in 
Fig 3b . The duration of charging/discharging also increased after ANT modification, ascribed to the Faradaic 
process. A single charge/discharge cycle is shown in SI, illustrating different charge/discharge time scales 
before and after modifications  (Fig S 25). The ANT -GR electrode shows the highest capacitance of 11 mF cm-
2 at a lower current density of 10 µA  cm-2 and decreases with increasing applied current density  (Fig 4 d-e). 
However, this value differs from the CVs measurements, which is because the charging /discharging current 
8 
 in CVs was much higher than the GCD measurements. A single GCD cycle illustrates charging and 
discharging time for bare GR at 3 s and 4 s and ANT -modified GR at 52 s and 66 s ( Fig. S2 5). The c ycle life 
of ANT/GR was determined  by performing 104 GCD cycles at an applied current density of 1 mA  cm-2 (Fig. 
S26). It is noteworthy to note that ANT/GR exhibited excellent cycling performance up to 104 GCD cycles  
and could  hold larger charges for a longer time  (Fig 4f , S27). Interestingly, a gradual increase in capacitance 
value with GCD cycling  was observed , suggesting a greater  number of active sites , confirmed by FE-SEM 
and BET analysis (Fig. S 28-30). After 104 GCD cycles , CVs were further performed , and there was a minor 
change in the shape of the CV ; however , five times increment in capacitance value  was noted  (Fig S 31).

bare GR at the applied current density of 0.1 mA  cm-2 and ANT/GR at 1 mA  cm-2, to ensure the experiment time was 
the same for bare GR and ANT/GR, 0.1 mA  cm-2 current density was applied.  
 
Areal energy density ( EA in Wh cm-2) and power density ( PA in W cm-2) are two crucial factors for 
electrochemical supercapacitors  and are calculated from the experimental data  at 30 µA  cm-2 (section  S16 in 
the SI). The bare GR exhibited an areal energy density of 0.01 µWh cm-2 and a power density of 10. 4 µW cm-
2. In contrast, the ANT -modified GR presented an areal energy density of 0.23 µWh cm-2 and a power density 
of 12.21 µW cm-2. Thus, compared to unmodified GR, ANT -modified GR showed 20 times increase in energy  
density; how ever, not much increase in power density was observed, demonstrating great potential for high 
energy density micro -supercapacitors .   
Both the CV and GCD techniques are based on the DC -based measurements produc ing either total current or 
charges in the system  but don’t forecast frequency response which is crucial for understanding capacitance  
9 
 performance.43 Electrochemical impedance diagrams obtained in frequency ranges of 10-1 – 104 Hz for bare 
GR electrode and ANT-modified GR electrode before and after cycling are presented in Fig. 5 . As expected, 
the bare electrode shows a constant phase element  (CPE)  (Fig. 5a ) that can be better evidenced from the 
variation of the imaginary part of the impedance as a function of t he frequency ( Fig. 5b ).44,45 The slope of the 
curve is the opposite of the coef ficient  of the CPE, whereas the determination of Q is possible from the 
following relationship , 𝑄=−1
𝑍𝑗×(2𝜋𝑓)𝛼×sin(𝛼𝜋
2) 
Then, using the Brug formula , 46,47 𝐶=𝑄1𝛼⁄𝑅𝑒(1−𝛼)𝛼⁄ 
in which 𝑅𝑒 is the electrolyte resistance, a capacitance of about 1.5 µF  cm-2 can be obtained. Such a value  is 
consistent with a double layer formed at a graphite/electrolyte interface.48 On the ANT-modified electrode 
(Fig. 5c ), the shape of the impedance diagram remains unchanged , but the modulus is 10 times s maller , 
corresponding to an increase in the active surface area. The graphical analysis of this diagram is also consistent 
with capacitive behavior  (Fig. 5d ). After 104 GCD cycles, the shape of the impedance diagram clearly shows 
two linear domains corresponding to two CPE behaviors, whereas the modulus is about 100 time s smaller 
than what is measured on the as -prepared electrode  (Fig. 5e ). This can be explained by a rearrangement of the 
layer upon cycling and the formation of small pores in the thin  film. This is confirmed by the graphical analysis 
presented in Fig. 5f , which distinctly  exhibit s two different linear domains for the determination of , one in 
the high frequencies with a value close to 0.66 and a second one in the lowest frequency domain with a value 
close to 0.81. Such a value in high frequency is consistent with a porous system. However, it is not possible 
to go further in the determination of the size, depth , and diameter of the pores because all these parameters 
are li nked.49 Moreover, the analysis of the graphically determined Q-parameter value ( Fig. 5f ) shows that the 
capacitance value is in the range of a few mF cm-2, in agreement with the CV, and GCD results , but the change 
of the active surface during cycling does not allow a better quantitative analysis. Finally, these diagrams were 
obtained at  Faradaic process  at +0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl  that is superimposed on the capacitive response. 
Extrapolation of the diagram presented in Fig. 5e allows  us to determine a charge transfer resistance of about 
100 Ω. This value can only be obtained at very low frequencies because of the parallel behavior of resistance 
with a double layer capacitance of electrode of a very high value. Furthermore, if we relate this value to a unit 
area, the analysis of impedance diagrams shows that there is an increase of a factor of 100 to 1000 between a 
bare electrode and  an electrode after cycling. We deduce that the charge transfer resistance is small, which is 
characteristic of a Nerstian system, again in agreement with the cyclic voltammetry results.

For a practical purpose, we further modified discharged graphite rod (GR) isolated directly from low-cost and 
commercially available an Eveready dry cell (EV -GR, AA, 1V) via electrochemical grafting using anthracene 
diazonium salts (Fig S32a). Compared to unmodified EV -GR, ANT -modified EV -GR show s a Faradaic redox 
feature at ~ +0.36 V (vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M H 2SO 4) and exhibits  seven times  increase in total areal capacitance. 
The large increase in capacitance observed with covalent ANT modifications calculated from GCD in − 0.1 V 
to + 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl at an applied current density of 30 µA/cm2 for nine cycles from 6 15±7.5 µF cm-2 to 
9761±44 µF  cm-2 (Fig S 32b-d). Further, the electrical conductivity of bare and modified GRs tested with two 
probes contact method and show ed excellent conduc tivity of modified GR , which were further employed for 
lighting the LED using a power supply ( Fig S 33-35). All these experimental results strongly suggest the 
replacement of traditionally used graphitic rods with ANT -modified graphitic rods.  Thus, our approach is 
highly encouraging to reuse of used carbon rod s for energy applications ; therefore , we develop ed a method of 
waste -to-energy conversion, a highly sustainable method . The anthracene -modified carbon electrodes can 
operate as excellent and high -performance electroc hemical supercapacitors  which originate from both 
11 
 contributions , non -Faradaic ( electrochemical double layer ) and Faradaic ( bias-driven 
protonation/deprotonation ) to various nitrogen fragments in molecular layers occurring in the positive 
potential ranges. The overall charging and discharging process are illustrated in Fig. 6a-b, which is mainly to 
the inclusion of proton (H+) not only to  pyridinic N, pyrolytic N, graphitic N, quaternary N , and N─N , but 
also to the porous surface of graphene rods . Though a similar protonation/deprotonation was described  by Gan 
et al. and other s but in the negative potential.50–52 Anthracene having lower band gap (3.2 eV) over pyrene 
(3.4 eV) and naphthalene  (4.3 eV , Table S3 ) is able to make films thicker than that of two, thus producing 
more nitrogen covering azo, which is the mai n stricking features of higher capacitance in anthrance -based 
molecular films.   The authors have searched for positive materials, and our work can bridge the gap here .

3. Conclusion  
As the world explores various n ovel possibilities for clean  and safe energy sources, organic supercapacitor s 
contribution is becoming more pronounced  due to their environmentally friendlier, sustainable , and less 
dependence on  inorganic metal oxide  materials . Organic materials derived from naturally abundant mater ials 
(C, H, N, and O) are structurally diverse  and can be functionally tailored by suitable synthetic ways to modify 
conducting carbon electrode s depending upon their applications, including in energy storage . Along with 
being based on naturally abundant elements, this chemistry makes it competitive with the inorganic electrodes 
when considering aspects such as environmental impact,  sustainability, energy consumption, and cyclic 
stability.  Also,  the method demonstrated here ha s the bright potentia l to further extend the scope of 
functionalization on a variety of carbon electrodes , including flexible carbon materials , and can be employed 
for microfabricated flexible supercapacitor devices.  To enhance our young family of organic supercapacitors, 
we d emonstrate that low -cost graphite rods modification in nanoscale dimension via versatile electrochemical 
showing promising opportunity to reusages of waste carbon rods for large amount of energy storage 
12 
 applications . The present  work  open s new horizons in the field of “all-organic” nanoscale  hybrid 
supercapacitors with baselines for future energy metrics to advance toward commercial implementations.  
  
4. Experimental Section:  
Materials. 1-aminoanthracene, 1 -aminopyrene, 1 -aminonaphthalene, sod ium nitrite (NaNO 2), tertiary butyl 
nitrite, tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF 4, 48% in water), tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) was purchased 
from Sigma -Aldrich (Bangalore, India), hydrochloric acid (Finar), acetonitrile (Avantore, HPLC -grade) was 
used as received. Cylindrical graphite rods (GR) used for electrochemical grafting were purchased from SPI 
supplies.  Eveready dry cell s were  used to isolate graphite rod s and cleaned  with acetone for 1 hour and then 
with distilled water . Diazonium salts of all thr ee amino precursors were synthesized by the reported 
methodology.  
E-chem grafting of different diazonium salts onto cylindrical graphite rod s  
Prior to electrochemical modification, the graphite rod (GR) was pretreated with distilled water for 15 min, 
followed by drying with a nitrogen gun. The GR s were then dried in an oven at 100°C for 10 min to remove 
any traces of water present and then cleaned by a nitrogen gun to remove unwanted contaminants. E -chem 
grafting was performed employing a conventional three -electrode system using Metrohm Autolab 
Electrochemical workstation (Model: 204, software nova -2.14) and analyzed by using origin pro -9.1. The GR 
was used as a working electrode , Ag/AgNO 3 and Pt were used as reference and counter electrodes, 
respectiv ely. All electrochemical measurements were recorded at room temperature. For electrochemical 
grafting, all diazonium solution concentrations were kept the same, that is 5 mM in HPLC -grade acetonitrile 
(ACN) with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as a supporting electrolyte. Prior to E-Chem 
grafting, all diazonium solutions were deoxygenated by nitrogen purging for 15 -20 min. After modification, 
the GR substrates were heavily rinsed with ACN to remove any physiosorbed materials.  
Characterization t echniques  
All Synthesized diazonium salts were characterized by Bruker ALPHA II FTIR spectrometer and JASCO V -
770 UV -Visible -NIR spectrophotometer (light source tungsten -deuterium lamp). Measurements were 
performed from 200 to 800 nm in a double beam mode and analyzed by origin pro -9.1. For thin film 
characterization, XRD was performed on bare GR and modified GR at room temperature in the 2θ range of 
5° to 90° with PANanalytical Empyrean ACMS 101.  Further,  Raman spectroscopy was performed using 
SP2500i Acto n instruments  for monochromator and Spectrograph, laser source 532 nm from laser quantum.  
The surface morphology of the bare GR and electrochemically modified GR were analyzed  by field emission 
scanning electron microscopy (FE -SEM) employing  zeiss, model: supra40VP . In addition, X -ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) module PHI 5000 
Versa Prob II, with a monochromat or Al K -α source (1486.6 eV), hemispherical analyzer, and multichannel 
detector. Survey spectra of individual samples were obtained, followed by high -resolution spectra of C 1 s and 
N 1s. N2 adsorption -desorption measurement based on the Brunauer -Emmett -Teller  (BET) principle  13 
 was performed using Autosorb I; Quatachrome Corp . For thickness measurement, ANT -D was 
electrochemically grafted on an ITO substrate using similar graftin g parameters . In tapping mode, surface 
morphology was analysed via atomic force microscopy (AFM) . The AFM measurement was performed with 
Asylum Research (Oxford Instruments) with a silicon probe having a force constant of 0.5 N/m . The images 
were recorded at 0.60 Hz,  set point  in the range of 760  mV-730 mV with a drive  frequency of 65.38 kHz.  The 
thickness was evaluated by scratching  the film with a sharp needle , and a line profile was drawn to get the 
thickness . All electrochemical Characterization was performed using a three -electrode system in  0.1 M H 2SO 4 
that was purged with nitrogen for 15 min prior to all measurements employing above mentioned Autolab 
Electrochemical workstation. Ag/Ag Cl (saturated KCl) was used as a reference, and a platinum wire was used 
as a counter electrode. For constant current charge/discharge measurements, bare GR  and modified GR 
substrates were charged from − 0.1 V  vs. Ag/AgCl  to + 0.7 V  vs. Ag/AgCl  and discharged from + 0.7 V  vs. 
Ag/AgCl  to − 0.1 V  vs. Ag/AgCl to  at different applied current densit ies.  Solid -sate I -V measurements was 
performed using KEITHLEY 2604B source meter  via two -probes contact .
