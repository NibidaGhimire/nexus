Abstract
We study stochastic properties of the norm cocycle associat ed with iid products of
positive matrices. We obtain the almost sure invariance pri nciple (ASIP) with rate o(n1/p)
under the optimal condition of a moment or order p >2 and the Berry-Esseen theorem
with rate O(1/√n) under the optimal condition of a moment of order 3. The resul ts are
also valid for the matrix norm. For the matrix coeﬃcients, we also have the ASIP but we
obtain only partial results for the Berry-Esseen theorem. T he proofs make use of coupling
coeﬃcients that surprisingly decay exponentially fast to 0 while there is only a polynomial
decay in the case of invertible matrices. All the results are actually valid in the context of
iid products of matrices leaving invariant a suitable cone.

1 Introduction
In a series of paper [10], [12], [13], [16] and [17] we studied the stochas tic properties of the
norm cocycle associated with the left random walk on GLd(R) under optimal or close to optimal
moment conditions. The moment conditions are optimal in case of the central limit theorem
(CLT) and the ASIP with rate and close to optimal in the case of the B erry-Esseen theorem.
We also obtained results for the matrix norm, the matrix coeﬃcients and the spectral radius.

1A key ingredient in the proofs is the use of some coupling coeﬃcients in troduced in [10], see
Section 3 for the deﬁnition.
It turns out that it is also possible to control similar coeﬃcients in the context of the left
random walk on the semi-group of matrices of size d≥2, with non-negative entries (that we call
positive matrices inthe sequel). Actually, onecan even prove the ex ponential convergence to 0 of
those coeﬃcients under polynomial moment conditions, see Propos ition 3.2. As a consequence,
we obtain Berry-Essen’s theorem with rate O(1/√n) under the optimal condition of a moment of
order 3. We also obtain optimal intermediary rates under moments o f orderp∈(2,3). Finally,
we also obtain optimal rates in the ASIP.
Let us mention that the study of iid products of positive matrices be neﬁted from a lot
of works. Let us cite, among others, Hennion [23], Buraczewski et al. [7], Buraczewski and
Mentmeier [8] or Grama, Liu and Xiao [21].
Hennion obtains the strong law of large numbers and the CLT under o ptimal moment con-
ditions in the more general situations of product of dependent pos itive random matrices, under
mixing conditions. All the other above mentionned papers assume ex ponential moment which
allows to use in a natural way the Guivarc’h-Nagev method, which is ba sed on perturbation of
operators.
It has been observed in the preprint [22], that the Guivarc’h-Nagae v method applies under
polynomial moment conditions. In particular, they obtain the Berry -Esseen theorem with rate
O(1/√n) under a moment of order 3 plus some extra technical condition, se e their condition
(A2).
In Section 2, we introduce some notations and deﬁnitions and we also recall several key
properties in the study of positive matrices.
In section 3, we establish the existence of a unique invariant probab ility and we estimate our
coupling coeﬃcents.
In section 4, we recall the strong law of large numbers of Hennion an d provide some comple-
mentary results.
In section 5, we recall the CLT and provide several identiﬁcation of the asymptotic variance
s2. Moreover, we show that the known aperiodicity condition (see Deﬁ nition 5.1) is suﬃcient
fors2>0, under a moment of order 2.
In section 6, we obtain the ASIP for the norm cocycle, the matrix no rm, the spectral radius
and the matrix coeﬃcients under optimal polynomial moment conditio n. We also consider the
2case of exponential moments, but we have a slight loss compare to t he known result in the iid
case (which corresponds to d= 1 in our setting).
In section 7, we obtain the Berry-Esseen theorem for all the abov e mentionned quantities.
The obtained rates are optimal (in terms of moment conditions) in th e case of the norm cocyle
and the matrix norm, but we have a loss in the case of the spectral r adius and the matrix
coeﬃcients.
In section 8 we study the regularity of the invariant measure and in s ection 9, we provide
some deviation inequalities for the norm cocycle and the matrix coeﬃc ients.
In section 10, we explain how to generalize our results to matrices lea ving invariant a suitable
cone (notice that the positive matrices of size dmay be seen as the matrices leaving invariant
the cone ( R+)d.
Finally, in section 11, we provide technical results relevant to the pr evious section.
In all the paper we denote N:={1,2,...}.
2 Norm cocycle and matrix norm
Letd≥2 be an integer. Let Gbe the semi-group of d-dimensional positive allowable matrices:
by positive, we mean that all entries are greater than or equal to 0 , by allowable, we mean that
any lign and any column admits a strictly positive element.
We endow Rdwith theℓ1norm andGwith the corresponding operator norm. We denote
both norms by /bardbl·/bardbl. Recall that /bardblg/bardbl= sup/bardblx/bardbl=1/bardblgx/bardbl.
We put on Gthe topology inherited from (the distance associated with) the nor m. Then,G
becomes a locally compact space.
LetG+be the sub-semi-group of Gwhose entries are all strictly positive. Actually, G+is
the interior of G.
Deﬁne
S+:={x= (x1,...,x d)∈Rd:/bardblx/bardbl= 1andxi≥0,∀i∈ {1,...,d}}, (2.1)
S++:={x= (x1,...,x d)∈Rd:/bardblx/bardbl= 1andxi>0,∀i∈ {1,...,d}}.(2.2)
Notice that for g∈G, we actually have /bardblg/bardbl= supx∈S+/bardblgx/bardbland that, if g= (gij)1≤i,j≤d,
/bardblg/bardbl= max
1≤j≤dd/summationdisplay
i=1gij. (2.3)
3For everyg∈G, setv(g) = inf x∈S+/bardblgx/bardbl. Ifg= (gij)1≤i,j≤d, we have
v(g) = min
1≤j≤dd/summationdisplay
i=1gij. (2.4)
By deﬁnition of G,v(g)>0 for every g∈G.
We then deﬁne N(g) := max( /bardblg/bardbl,1/v(g)) andL(g) =/bardblg/bardbl
v(g). Notice that N(g)2≥L(g)≥1
for everyg∈G.
We endowS+with the following metric (see Proposition 10.1 for a proof that it is inde ad a
metric). For every x, y∈S+,
d(x,y) =ϕ(m(x,y)m(y,x)),
where
ϕ(s) =1−s
1+s∀s∈[0,1], (2.5)
and
m(u,v) = inf/braceleftbiggui
vi:i∈ {1,...,d}, vi>0./bracerightbigg
Notice that the diameter of S+is 1 and that d(x,y) = 1 if and only if there exists i0∈
{1,...,d}such thatxi0= 0 andyi0>0 orxi0>0 andyi0= 0.
Using that for u,v∈S+, max1≤i≤dui≤1 and max 1≤i≤dvi≥1/d, we see that m(u,v)≤d.
The semi-group Gis acting on S+as follows.
g·x=gx
/bardblgx/bardbl∀(g,x)∈G×S+.
We then deﬁne a cocyle by setting σ(g,x) = log(/bardblgx/bardbl) for every ( g,x)∈G×S+. The cocycle
property reads
σ(gg′,x) =σ(g,g′·x)+σ(g′,x). (2.6)
Following Hennion [23, Lemma 10.6], for every g∈Gwe deﬁnec(g) := supx,y∈S+d(gx,gy).
Let us recall some properties that one may ﬁnd in Hennion [23], see his Lemmas 5.2, 5.3 and
10.6 and his Proposition 3.1.
Proposition 2.1. For every (g,g′,x,y)∈G2×(S+)2we have
(i)|σ(g,x)| ≤logN(g);
(ii)/bardblx−y/bardbl ≤2d(x,y);
4(iii)|σ(g,x)−σ(g,y)| ≤2L(g)d(x,y);
(iv)|σ(g,x)−σ(g,y)| ≤2ln/parenleftbig
1/(1−d(x,y))/parenrightbig
;
(v)c(gg′)≤c(g)c(g′);
(vi)c(g)≤1andc(g)<1iﬀg∈G+;
(vii)d(g·x,g·y)≤c(g)d(x,y).
Let us also mention a closed-form expression for c(g) obtained in Lemma 10.7 of [23]. For
everyg= (gij)1≤i,j≤dwe have
c(g) = max
1≤i,j,k,ℓ≤d|gijgkℓ−giℓgkj|
gijgkℓ+giℓgkj. (2.7)
Notice that ( g,x)→gxis continuous on G×S+(for the distance on Ginduced by the
operator norm and the distance on S+induced by /bardbl·/bardbl) and does not vanish. Hence, it follows
from item ( ii) that (g,x)→g·xis continuous on G×S+(for the distance on Ginduced by the
operator norm and the distance donS+).
Let us give some more properties that will be useful in the sequel. Se te={1/d,...,1/d} ∈
S+. Forg∈G, we denote by gtthe adjoint matrix of g.
Lemma 2.2. For every (g,x,y)∈G×(S+)2,
(i)|σ(g,x)−σ(g,y)| ≤logL(g);
(ii)/bardblge/bardbl ≤ /bardblg/bardbl ≤d/bardblge/bardbl;
(iii)/bardblg/bardbl ≤d/bardblgt/bardbl;
(iv)|σ(g,x)−σ(g,y)| ≤2(2+logL(g))d(x,y).
Remark. The inequality in item ( iv) of Lemma 2.2 is much better that the one in item ( iii) of
Proposition 2.1.
Proof.Items (i) and (ii) are obvious. Item ( iii) is an easy consequence of (2.3). Let us prove
item (iv). Letx, y∈S+. Assume that d(x,y)≤1/2. Notice that for every t∈[0,1/2],
ln(1/(1−t))≤2t. Hence, using item ( iv) of Proposition 2.1, we see that |σ(g,x)−σ(g,y)| ≤
4d(x,y). If 2d(x,y)≥1, then the desired conclusion follows from item ( i) of Lemma 2.2. /square
Proposition 2.3. (S+,d)is complete and S++is closed.
5Remark. A Hint of proof of completeness is given after Theorem 4.1 of Bushell [9], for Hilbert’s
metric given by dH(x,y) =−ln(m(x,y)m(y,x)). See Proposition 10.1 for a proof in a more
general situation.
Let us state some of the assumptions used throughout the paper .
Deﬁnition 2.1. Letµbe a Borel probability on Gandp≥1. We say that µadmits a moment
of orderpif /integraldisplay
G(log(N(g)))pdµ(g)<∞.
We say that µalmost admits a moment of order pif
/integraldisplay
G(log(L(g)))pdµ(g)<∞.
Remark. Clearly, since L(g)≤N(g)2, ifµadmits a moment of order p≥1, it almost admits
a moment of order p≥1, but the converse is not true in general, see the example in Section 6.
Assume now that µalmost admits a moment of order p≥1. Then,µadmits a moment of order
piﬀ/integraltext
G|log/bardblg/bardbl|pdµ(g)<∞iﬀ/integraltext
G|logv(g)|pdµ(g)<∞.
Similarly, we say that µadmits or almost admits an exponential moment of order γ >0, if
there exists δ>0 such that, respectively,
/integraldisplay
GeδN(g)γdµ(g)<∞,
or /integraldisplay
GeδL(g)γdµ(g)<∞.
Deﬁnition 2.2. Wesaythat µisstrictly contracting ifthereexists r∈N, suchthatµ∗r(G+)>0.
Equivalently, the closed semi-group Γ µgenerated by the support of µhas non empty inter-
section with G+.
3 Invariant measure and coupling coeﬃcients
Recall that a Borel (with respect to d) probability νonS+is said to be µ-invariant if for every
Borel non negative function ϕonS+,/integraltext
G×S+ϕ(g·x)dµ(g)dν(x) =/integraltext
S+ϕ(x)dν(x). It is well
known and easy to prove (recall that ( g,x)→g·x) is continuous on G×S+) that the support
of aµ-invariant measure is Γ µ-invariant, i.e. satisﬁes Γ µ·suppν⊂suppν.
We will see that when µis strictly contracting, it admits a unique µ-invariant probability on
S+. We need some further notation to identify its support.
6Letg∈G+. By the Perron-Frobenius theorem (see Theorem 1.1.1 of [29]), the re exists a
uniquex∈S++such thatgx=κ(g)x, whereκ(g) is the spectral radius of g. We denote that
vector byvg. Then, clearly, we have
κ(g)≥v(g)∀g∈G. (3.1)
Following [7] (see (2.4) there) we deﬁne
Λµ={vg:g∈Γµ∩G+},
where the closure is taken with respect to d. By Proposition 2.3, Λ µ⊂S++.
It follows from Lemma 4.2 of [7] that Λ µis Γµ-invariant (i.e. Γ µ·Λµ⊂Λµ).
The existence and uniqueness in the next proposition follow from The orem 2.1 of [24]. We
provide a slightly diﬀerent proof and identify the support of the inva riant measure.
Proposition 3.1. Assume that µis strictly contracting. Then, there exists a unique µ-invariant
probabilityνonS+. Moreover suppν= Λµ.
Proof.Let (Yn)n∈Nbe iid random variables taking values in G, with lawµ. Letr∈Nbe as in
Deﬁnition 2.2. For every n∈N, setBn:=Y1···Yn. Letm:= [n/r]. Notice that, by item ( v) of
Proposition 2.1, c(Bn)≤/producttextm−1
k=0c(Ykr+1···Y(k+1)r). By the strong law of large numbers and the
fact thatµis strictly contracting, using item ( vi) of Proposition 2.1,
1
mm−1/summationdisplay
k=0logc(Ykr+1···Y(k+1)r)−→
m→+∞E(logc(Y1···Yr))<0P-a.s.
Hence,c(Bn) =O(δm) almost surely for some 0 < δ <1. In particular, c(Bn)<1 fornlarge
enough, so that, by item ( vi) of Proposition 2.1, Bn∈G+andBn·x∈S++for everyx∈S+.
Letx∈S+. By item ( vii) of Proposition 2.1, there exists a non negative random variable
K, independent of x, such that for every n∈N,
d(Bn·x,Bn+1·x)≤c(Bn)≤Kδm.
Hence (Bn·x)n∈Nis Cauchy, taking values in S++fornlarge enough, hence converges to some
random variable Zwhose law is µ-invariant. By item ( vii) of Proposition 2.1, d(Bn·x,Bn·y)≤
c(Bn) and we see that ( Bn·y)n∈Nconverges to Zfor everyy∈S+.
Letνbe aµ-invariant probability on S+. Then, for every m∈N, and every continuous
boundedϕonS+, we have
/integraldisplay
S+ϕdν=/integraldisplay
S+E/parenleftbig
ϕ(Bm·x)/parenrightbig
dν(x)−→
m→+∞E(ϕ(Z)),
7which proves uniqueness.
The fact that supp ν⊃Λµfollows from the fact that supp νis Γµ-invariant and from Lemma
4.2 of [7]. To prove the converse inclusion, just notice that, since Γ µ·Λµ⊂Λµ, for everyx∈Λµ,
Bn·x∈Λµalmost surely. Hence Z∈Λµalmost surely and ν(Λµ) = 1 which implies the desired
result. /square
Let (Yn)n∈Nbe iid random variables taking values in G, with lawµ. For every n∈N, set
An:=Yn···Y1.
For everyp≥1 and every n∈Ndeﬁne
δp,∞(n) := sup
x,y∈S+E/parenleftbig
|σ(Yn,An−1·x)−σ(Yn,An−1·y)|p/parenrightbig
.
Those coeﬃcients have been introduced in [10], in the setting of pro ducts of iid matrices in
GLd(R), and proved to be very useful in [13] and [16], see also [12].
We shall see that those coeﬃcients decrease exponentially fast to 0, as soon as µ(almost)
admits a moment of order 1, while we obtained only a polynomial speed o f convergence in the
case ofGLd(R).
Actually, we will prove the result for the stronger coeﬃcients
˜δp,∞(n) :=E/parenleftbig
sup
x,y∈S+|σ(Yn,An−1·x)−σ(Yn,An−1·y)|p/parenrightbig
.
Proposition 3.2. Assume that µis strictly contracting and almost admits a moment of order
p≥1. Then, there exists 0<a<1such that
δp,∞(n)≤˜δp,∞(n) =O(an), (3.2)
and
sup
x,y∈S+sup
n∈N|σ(An,x)−σ(An,y)| ∈Lp. (3.3)
In particular,
sup
n∈N|log/bardblAn/bardbl−logv(An)| ∈Lp. (3.4)
Proof.Letn∈N. By item ( iv) of Lemma 2.2 and item ( vii) of Proposition 2.1, for every
x, y∈S+, we have
|σ(Yn,An−1·x)−σ(Yn,An−1·y)| ≤(4+2logL(Yn))d(An−1·x,An−1·y)≤(4+2logL(Yn))c(An−1).
8Letr∈Nbe as in Deﬁnition 2.2. Then, by item ( vi) of Proposition 2.1, there exists ε>0 such
that
µ∗r(c(g)≤1−ε) =:γ >0. (3.5)

4 The strong law of large numbers
Except the L1-convergences, the results of that section are essentially conta ined in Hennion’s
paper [23] (where a more general situation is considered), see his T heorem 2 and its proof.
We ﬁrst recall the version of Kingman’s subadditive ergodic theorem relevant to our setting
(see [28, Theorems 1 and 2]). The fact that λµin the proposition is constant follows from
Kolmogorov’s 0 −1 law.
Proposition 4.1 (Kingman) .Assume that/integraltext
G/vextendsingle/vextendsinglelog/bardblg/bardbl/vextendsingle/vextendsingledµ(g)<∞. Then, (1
nlog/bardblAn/bardbl)n≥1
converges P-a.s. and in L1to some constant λµ∈R.
Remark. Using that /bardblg/bardbl ≥v(g) for every g∈G+, we see that log−/bardblg/bardbl ≤log−v(g), where
log−(x) = max( −logx,0) for every x>0. In particular, if µor ˜µadmit a moment of order 1,
then,/integraltext
G/vextendsingle/vextendsinglelog/bardblg/bardbl/vextendsingle/vextendsingledµ(g)<∞.
We then provide the SLLN for various quantities related to ( An)n∈Nand identify the limit
under a stronger assumption.
Theorem 4.2. Assume that µis strictly contracting and that µadmits a moment of order 1.
Then, for every x∈S+,
lim
n→+∞σ(An,x)
n= lim
n→+∞logv(An)

n→+∞logκ(An)
n=λµP-a.s., (4.1)

G×S+σ(g,x)dµ(g)dν(x). Moreover, the convergences also hold in L1and, we even
have

Remark. TheP-a.s. andL1convergence of (1
nlogv(An))n∈Nwhen/integraltext
G|logv(g)|dµ(g)<∞
(which holds if µadmits a moment of order 1) follow from Kingman’s subadditive ergodic
Theorem applied to ( −logv(An))n∈N. The formula for λµmay be derived from the formula in
the middle of page 1568 of [23].
Proof.By Proposition 4.1 and the remark after it, we have the P-a.s. andL1convergence of
((log/bardblAn/bardbl)/n)n∈Ntoλµ.
By (3.4), we infer the L1convergence for v(An).
DeﬁneZ:= supn∈N|log/bardblAn/bardbl−logv(An)|. By (3.4), Z∈L1and, for every ε>0,
/summationdisplay
n∈NP(|log/bardblAn/bardbl−logv(An)| ≥εn)≤CE(Z)<∞.
TheP-a.s. convergence for ( v(An))n∈Nthen follows from the one for ( /bardblAn/bardbl)n∈Nand the Borel-
Cantelli lemma.
The convergences for κ(An) follows from the bounds v(An)≤κ(An)≤ /bardblAn/bardbl(see (3.1) for
the ﬁrst bound).
Finally, notice that for every n∈N,
sup
x∈S+|σ(An,x)−nλµ| ≤max(|log/bardblAn/bardbl−nλµ|,|logv(An)−nλµ|),
which proves the remaining convergences.
Hence, it remains to identify λµ. From the above, using the µ-invariance of ν, we infer that

We shall now consider the case of matrix coeﬃcients. The proof will r elie on Lemma 4.3
below, which is essentially Lemma 2.1 of [24] (see also Lemma 6.3 of [7] fo r (4.3)). We need also
some further notations.
10For every 0 <δ≤1, set
Gδ:={g∈G:/a\}bracketle{tx,gy/a\}bracketri}ht ≥δ∀x,y∈S+},
and notice that G+=∪δ∈(0,1]Gδ.
Letr∈Nbe such that µ∗r(G+)>0. There exists n0∈N, such that µ∗r(G1/n0)>0. Then,
we deﬁne
Tn0:= inf{m∈N:Ymr...Y(m−1)r+1∈G1/n0}. (4.2)
Since (Ymr...Y(m−1)r+1)m∈Nis iid with law µ∗randµ∗r(G1/n0)>0, we know that Tn0<∞

Hence
/bardblAnx/bardbl//bardblAn/bardbl ≥v(ArTn0)/(n0/bardblArTn0/bardbl)1{rTn0≤n}+v(An)//bardblAn/bardbl1{rTn0>n},
which proves (4.3).
Let us prove (4.4). We proceed similarly. Let x, y∈S+. Letn≥rTn0. We have

Moreover, ((log/bardblAn/bardbl−nλµ)/n)n∈Nand((logκ(An)−nλµ)/n)n∈Nconverge P-a.s. and in L1to

Proof.First notice that Proposition 4.1 applies, which yields the P-a.s. andL1convergence for
log/bardblAn/bardbland for log /bardblAt

By Lemma 4.3, there exists a random variable W≥0 such that, for every x, y∈S+and
everyn∈N, on the set {rTn0≤n},

This gives the desired convergence for the coeﬃcients. The P-a.s. convergences for κ(An) and

12TheL1convergence for κ(An), follows from Theorem 4.2 applied to ˜ µ, using item ( iii) of Lemma
2.2, noticing that ( Y1,...,Y n) has the same law as ( Yn,...,Y 1). /square
Assume that µ(hence ˜µ) is strictly contracting and that µand ˜µboth admit a moment of
order 1. Denoting by ˜ νthe only ˜µ-invariant probability on S+, and using that At

Under our assumptions, one cannot expect the L1convergence in Theorem 4.4 for v(An).

Similarly, even if µand ˜µare strictly contracting and admit a moment of order 1, we may
not haveL1convergence for the coeﬃcients.
For instance, let µbe such that µ({Id}) = 1/2, withIdthe identity matrix. Then,
µ∗n({Id})≥2−nand, with {e1,e2}the canonical basis of R2,µ({g∈G:/a\}bracketle{te1,ge2/a\}bracketri}ht= 0})>0, so
thatE(log/a\}bracketle{te1,Ane2/a\}bracketri}ht) =−∞.
5 The CLT and the asymptotic variance
We start by proving a martingale-coboundary decomposition. In th e case of invertible matrices,
such a decomposition was only available for p≥2 while here it holds as soon as p≥1.
Proposition 5.1. Assume that µis strictly contracting and admits a moment of order p≥1.
There exists a continuous and bounded function ψonXsuch that/parenleftbig
σ(Yn,An−1·x)−λµ+ψ(An·x)−
ψ(An−1·x)/parenrightbig
n∈Nis a sequence of martingale diﬀerencesin Lp. If moreover W0is a random variable
with lawν, independent from (Yn)n∈N, then/parenleftbig
σ(Yn,An−1·W0)−λµ+ψ(An·W0)−ψ(An−1·W0)/parenrightbig
n∈N
is astationary and ergodic sequence of martingale diﬀerences in Lp.
13Remark. The function ψin the theorem is given by
ψ(x) :=/summationdisplay
n≥1/parenleftBig/integraldisplay
G×Gσ(g,g′·x)dµ(g)dµ∗(n−1)(g′)−λµ/parenrightBig
. (5.1)
Proof.Letψbe given by (5.1). The fact that ψis well-deﬁned and continuous follows from
Proposition 3.2.
Then, notice that
σ(g,x)−λµ=σ(g,x)−/integraldisplay
Gσ(g′,x)dµ(g′)+/integraldisplay
Gσ(g′,x)dµ(g′)−λµ
and, using the deﬁnition of ψ,
/integraldisplay
Gσ(g,x)dµ(g)−λµ+/integraldisplay
Gψ(g·x)dµ(g) =ψ(x).
Now,/parenleftBig
σ(Yn,An−1·x)−/integraltext
Gσ(g,An−1·x)dµ(g)/parenrightBig
n∈Nis a sequence of martingale diﬀerences in Lp
(notice that x/ma√sto→/integraltext
Gσ(g,x)dµ(g) is bounded). Moreover,
/integraldisplay
Gσ(g,An−1·x)dµ(g)−λµ+ψ(An·x)−ψ(An−1·x) =ψ(An·x)−/integraldisplay
Gψ(gAn−1·x)dµ(g),
and the RHS deﬁnes a sequence of bounded martingale diﬀerences.
The ﬁnal statement follows from the fact that (( Yn,An−1·W0))n∈Nis a stationary and
(uniquely) ergodic Markov chain.
/square
Deﬁnition 5.1. We say that a probability µonGis aperiodic if the group generated by
{logκ(g) :g∈Γµ}is dense in R.
We now state and prove various CLTs. Those CLTs are proved in Hen nion [23] by a slightly
diﬀerent approach (also based on a martingale-coboundary decom position). We complement the
resultsofHennionbyidentifying theasymptoticvariance s2inseveral waysandbycharacterizing
the fact that s2>0. The characterization is the same as in [7] or in [22] but its proof doe s not
require exponential moments as in those works.
Proposition 5.2. Assume that µis strictly contracting and admits a moment of order 2. Then,
there exists s2≥0such that, with W0as in Proposition 5.1,1
nE[(σ(An,W0)−nλµ)2]−→
n→+∞s2
and1√n(σ(An,W0)−nλµ)⇒ N(0,s2). If there does not exist m∈Nandψmcontinuous on S+
such that
σ(g,x)−mλµ=ψm(x)−ψm(g·x)forµ⊗m⊗ν-almost every (g,x)∈G×S+,(5.2)
thens2>0. In particular, if µis aperiodic, then s2>0.
14Remark. Under the assumptions of the proposition we actually have the func tional central
limit theorem. It is well-known that the variance is given by
s2=E(σ(A1,W0)2)+2/summationdisplay
n≥2E(σ(A1,W0)σ(An,W0))
=/integraldisplay
G×S+σ2(g,x)dµ(g)dν(x)+2/summationdisplay
n≥2/integraldisplay
G2×S+σ(g,x)σ(g′g,x)dµ∗(n−1)(g′)dµ(g)dν(x).
Proof.For everyn∈N, setDn:=σ(Yn,An−1·W0)−λµ+ψ(An·W0)−ψ(An−1·W0). By
Proposition 5.1, ( Dn)n∈Nis a stationary and ergodic sequence of martingale diﬀerences in L2.
In particular, ( D1+...+Dn)/√n⇒ N(0,s2), withs2=E(D2
1) =E((D1+...+Dn)2)/n.
Hence, the CLT with the description of the variance follows from the following reformulation of
Proposition 5.1:
σ(An,W0)−nλµ= (D1+...+Dn)+ψ(W0)−ψ(An·W0). (5.3)
Assume now that s2= 0. Then/integraldisplay
G(σ(g,x)−λµ−ψ(x)+ψ(g·x))2dµ(g)dν(x) = 0.
Hence, (5.2) holds with m= 1 andψ1=ψ. Letm>1. Notice that µ∗mis strictly contracting
and admits a moment of order pand that the unique µ∗m-invariant measure is the unique µ-
invariant measure. Notice also that λµ∗m=mλµ. Applying the above argument to µ∗m, we infer
that there exists a continuous ψmsatisfying to (5.2).
Using that ψmis continuous, we see that (5.2) holds for every g∈suppµ∗mand every
x∈suppν.
Letg∈suppµ∗m⊂Γµ. Then,vg∈Λµ⊂suppν. Sinceg·vg=vgandσ(g,vg) = logκ(g),
we infer that ψm(g·vg) =ψm(vg) and that log κ(g) =mλµ.
Hence, logκ(Γµ)⊂λµNandµcannot be aperiodic. /square

nE((logκ(An)−nλµ)2),
15and the CLT holds if we replace σ(An,W0)withσ(An,x),log/bardblAn/bardbl,logv(An)orlogκ(An).

Proof.The result follows from Proposition 5.2 and Proposition 3.2 (using (3.1) ). /square
We also have a (functional) CLT for the coeﬃcients. As noticed in the previous section, one
cannot expect in general to identify s2thanks to the matrix coeﬃcients as in Proposition 5.3.

6 The almost sure invariance principle
Theorem 6.1. Letp≥2. Assume that µis strictly contracting and admits a moment of order
p. Lets2be as in Proposition 5.2. Then, one can redeﬁne the process (σ(An,W0))n∈Non another
probability space on which there exist iid variables (Nn)n∈Nwith law N(0,s2), such that
|σ(An,W0)−nλµ−(N1+...+Nn)|=o(/radicalbig
nloglogn)P-a.s. ifp= 2
and|σ(An,W0)−nλµ−(N1+...+Nn)|=o(n1/p)P-a.s. ifp>2
Remark. It is not necessary here that s2>0.
Proof.Whenp >2, the result follows from Theorem 1 of [13] by taking into account (3 .2).
The casep= 2 follows from (5.3) and the ASIP for martingales with stationary an d ergodic
increments in L2. /square
Proceeding as in the proof of Theorem 4.2, one can prove that the a bove theorem holds if we
replace (σ(An,W0))n∈Nwith any of the following sequences: ( σ(An,x))n∈N(for a given x∈S+),
(log/bardblAn/bardbl)n∈N, (logκ(An))n∈Nor (logv(An))n∈N.
Let us give the ASIP for the matrix coeﬃcients.
16Theorem 6.2. Letp≥2. Assume that µis strictly contracting and that µand˜µadmit a
moment of order p. Then, for every x, y∈S+, one can redeﬁne the process (log/a\}bracketle{ty,Anx/a\}bracketri}ht)n∈Non
another probability space on which there exist iid variable s(Nn)n∈Nwith law N(0,s2), such that
|log/a\}bracketle{ty,Anx/a\}bracketri}ht−nλµ−(N1+...+Nn)|=o(/radicalbig
nloglogn)P-a.s. ifp= 2
and|log/a\}bracketle{ty,Anx/a\}bracketri}ht−nλµ−(N1+...+Nn)|=o(n1/p)P-a.s. ifp>2
The proof may be done similarly to the one of Theorem 4.4. Since ˜ µalmost admit a moment
of orderp≥1,

and we conclude thanks to Theorem 6.1, using (4.5) and the fact tha tP(Tn0<∞) = 1.
In case of exponential moments, combining ideas from [13] and [11], it is possible to obtain
logarithmicratesintheASIP. However thoseratesarenotasgood asforthesumsofindependent
variables: in the case of a sum of iid variables it is possible to obtain a rat eO((logn)(1/gamma))
insteadofO((logn)2+1/γ)under exponential moments oforder γ∈(0,1]. Let usstatetheresults,
the proof will be done in a forthcoming work [15].
Theorem 6.3. Assume that µis strictly contracting and admits an exponential moment of order
γ∈(0,1]. Lets2be as in Proposition 5.2. Then, one can redeﬁne the process (σ(An,W0))n∈N
on another probability space on which there exist iid variab les(Nn)n∈Nwith law N(0,s2), such
that
|σ(An,W0)−nλµ−(N1+...+Nn)|=O((logn)2+1/γ)P-a.s.
Again, thetheoremis trueif ifwe replace ( σ(An,W0))n∈Nwithany ofthefollowing sequences:
(σ(An,x))n∈N, (log/bardblAn/bardbl)n∈N, (logκ(An))n∈Nor (logv(An))n∈N.
We also have a result for the coeﬃcients.
Theorem 6.4. Assume that µis strictly contracting and that µand˜µadmit an exponential
moment of order γ∈(0,1]. Lets2be as in Proposition 5.2. Then, for every x, y∈S+, one
can redeﬁne the process (log/a\}bracketle{ty,Anx/a\}bracketri}ht)n∈Non another probability space on which there exists iid
normal variables (Nn)n∈Nwith law N(0,s2)such that
|log/a\}bracketle{ty,Anx/a\}bracketri}ht−nλµ−(N1+...+Nn)|=O((logn)2+1/γ)P-a.s.
17Proof.Letx,y∈S+. Letn∈N. We have
log/a\}bracketle{ty,Anx/a\}bracketri}ht−log/bardblAnx/bardbl= log/a\}bracketle{ty,An·x/a\}bracketri}ht.
In view of Theorem 6.3, it suﬃces to prove that there exists c>0 such that
/summationdisplay
n≥1P(|log/a\}bracketle{ty,An·x/a\}bracketri}ht| ≥c(logn)1/γ)<∞.
We will use thefollowing simple observation, which follows fromthe indep endence of( Yn)n∈N.

Letη,δbe as in (8.4). For n≥[(logn)cγ/η] (with [·] the integer part), using (8.4), we have
P(|log/a\}bracketle{ty,An·x/a\}bracketri}ht| ≥c(logn)1/γ) =P(|log/a\}bracketle{ty,An·x/a\}bracketri}ht| ≥η(log(n(c/η)γ))1/γ)

Remarks. By some arguments already mentionned, (7.3) also holds if ˜ µis strictly contracting
and admits a moment of order p∈(2,3]. Let us notice that (7.1) follows also from Theorem 2.3
18of [27], since the Assumptions 2.1 there are satisﬁed due to the expo nential convergence of the
coeﬃcients δ∞,pin Proposition 3.2.
Finally, let us mention that Grama et al. [22] obtained (7.2) and (7.3) fo rp= 3 under their

cn= (√n/bn)q) to obtain (7.4). Then, (7.5) follows from the fact that v(An)≤κ(An)≤ /bardblAn/bardbl.

Proof. As before we prove the result for v(An) in place of κ(An). Letε∈(0,1) be such
(3.5) holds. Let x, y∈S+. Letn∈N. Letω∈Ω. Let 1 ≤m <[n/r] be such that
19c(Ymr···Y(m−1)r+1)(ω)≤1−ε. Using the cocycle property and several items of Proposition 2.1
(in particular item ( iv)), we see that

7.2 ifp <3and those of Proposition 7.3 if p= 3. Then,(7.5)(ifp <3) and(7.6)(ifp= 3)
hold with infx,y∈S+/a\}bracketle{ty,Anx/a\}bracketri}htin place of κ(An).
20Proof.Recall that, for every 0 <δ≤1, we deﬁned
Gδ:={g∈G:/a\}bracketle{tx,g·y/a\}bracketri}ht ≥δ∀x,y∈S+}.
Notice that g∈Gδif and only if for every y∈S+all the coordinates of g·yare greater that
δ, i.e.g·y−dδe∈(R+)d.
Letx, y∈S+. Letn∈N,ω∈Ω andn0∈N. Let 1 ≤m <[n/r] be such that
(Ymr···Y(m−1)r+1)(ω)∈G1/n0. We have (omitting ω)

Hence, on the set
∆n,m:={ω∈Ω|∃k∈[m,[n/r]−1] : (Ykr···Y(k−1)r+1)(ω)∈G1/n0},

Notice that all the above quantities are non positive and that min mr≤ℓ≤n/parenleftbig
logv(Yt

Notice also that P(∆c
n,m) =η[n/r−m]for some 0 ≤η <1, forn0large enough.
Then, we conclude thanks to Lemma 2.1, using Proposition 3.2 and Lem ma 7.4 with ˜ µand
takingm= [n/r]−Clogn, withC|logη|>1/2 (always true if η= 0). /square
We shall now obtain the rate O(1/√n) for the spectral radius and the coeﬃcients under a
much stronger condition.
Theorem 7.6. Letp∈(2,3]. Assume that µis strictly contracting and admits a moment of
orderp. Assume that s2>0. Assume that there exists 0< δ≤1such thatµ∗r(Gδ) = 1.
Then the conclusion of Theorem 7.1 holds with log/parenleftbig
infx,y∈S+/a\}bracketle{tx,Any)/a\}bracketri}htorlogκ(An)instead of
log/bardblAn/bardbl.
Proof.By assumption, for every n≥randx∈S+, using thatAnx
/bardblAnx/bardbl= (Yn···Yn+1−r)·(An−rx),
we have, for every x,y∈S+
1≥/a\}bracketle{ty,Anx/a\}bracketri}ht
/bardblAnx/bardbl≥δP-a.s.
Then, the result follows from Theorem 7.1 and the fact that /bardblAn/bardbl ≥κ(An)≥infx,y∈S+/a\}bracketle{tx,Any/a\}bracketri}ht
. /square
21We now give a condition that is equivalent to the condition µ∗r(Gδ)>0. An equivalent
condition, speciﬁc to the case of positive matrices (hence not valid in the general situation
considered in Section 10), has been obtained in [22], see their Lemma 2 .1.
For everyC >0 and 0≤γ <1, set
GC,γ:={g∈G:c(g)≤γand/bardblg/bardbl ≤Cv(gt)}.
Lemma 7.7. For every 0< δ≤1, there exists 0≤γ <1andC >0such thatGδ⊂GC,γ.
Conversely, for every 0≤γ′<1and everyC′>0there exists 0<δ′≤1such thatGC′,γ′⊂Gδ′.
Hence, there exists 0< δ≤1such thatµ(Gδ)>0if and only if there exists 0≤γ <1and
C >0such thatµ(GC,γ)>0.
Proof.The proof relies on the following observations: for every x∈S+,/a\}bracketle{tx,ge/a\}bracketri}ht=/bardblgtx/bardbland
/bardblgtx/bardbl//bardblg/bardbl ≥ /a\}bracketle{tx,g·e/a\}bracketri}ht/d≥ /bardblgtx/bardbl/(d/bardblg/bardbl).
Letg∈Gδ, withδ>0. By the previous computations, /bardblg/bardbl ≤v(gt)/δ.
Letx,y∈S+. Let us bound d(g·x,g·y). For every u∈S+, we have
δ/a\}bracketle{tu,g·y/a\}bracketri}ht ≤δ≤ /a\}bracketle{tu,g·x/a\}bracketri}ht.
Thisimplies that m(g·x,g·y)≥δ(noticethatthenwe must have δ≤1. Similarly, m(g·y,g·x)≥
δandd(g·x,g·y)≤1−δ2
1+δ2=:γ <1. So,Gδ⊂G1/δ,γ.
Let 0≤γ <1 andC >0. Letg∈GC,γ. Letx,y∈S+. Notice that m(g·x,g·y)≤1.
Hence,γ≥d(g·x,g·y)≥1−m(y,x)
1+m(y,x)andm(y,x)≥1−γ
1+γ. We infer that g·y−1−γ
1+γg·xhas non

9 Deviation inequalities

23Proposition 9.1 is the version for positive matrices of Theorem 4.1 of [1 2], stated for invertible
matrices. The proof is exactly the same. Let us mention thekey ingr edients: The result concerns
a cocycle for which, when p≥2, the function ψin (5.1) is well deﬁned and bounded and
supk≥1supx∈S+/bardblE((σ(Yk,Ak−1·x))2|Fk−1)/bardbl∞<∞; and, when 1 ≤p <2, one can control the
coeﬃcients δ1,∞(n).
Concerning the matrix coeﬃcients, the following result holds.

10 Generalization to cones
In this section we show how to extend the previous results to gener al cones. In the previous
sections we studied products of positive matrices, that is product s of matrices leaving invariant
the cone ( R+)d. In this section we consider more general cones. This type of gene ralization was
also investigated in [7].
There are many examples of closed solid cones as the ones considere d below. For instance,
the Lorentz (or ice-cream) cone: {(x1,...,x n,z)∈Rn+1:z≥0, x2
1+...+x2
n≤z2}. The linear
operators (of matrices) leaving invariant the Lorentz cone have b een studied in details by Loewy
and Schneider [30].
Another example is the cone KSof positive semi-deﬁnite matrices of order nviewed as a cone
of the vector space of symmetric matrices of order n. Examples of operatorsleaving invariant KS
24are given by M/ma√sto→AtMAwhereAis a matrix of size norM/ma√sto→tr(MR0)S0, withR0, S0∈KS
and convex combinations of those.
Letd≥2. We endow V=Rdwith its usual inner product /a\}bracketle{t·,·/a\}bracketri}htand the associated norm
/bardbl·/bardbl2.
LetKbe a closed proper convex cone with non empty interior of Rd. We recall that a cone
ofRdis a set of Rdstable by multiplication by non-negative real numbers and that it is pr oper
ifK∩(−K) ={0}.
We shall call such cones closed solid cones .
Usually, the term solid cone , refers only to a cone with non empty interior as in [29], page 3.
Hence, we add the convexity and the fact that K∩(−K) ={0}.
We associate with Kits dual cone K∗:={x∗∈V∗:/a\}bracketle{tx∗,x/a\}bracketri}ht ≥0∀x∈V}.
By Lemma 1.2.4 of [29], K∗is also a closed solid cone. Moreover, for every x∗∈int(K∗),
(the interior of K∗)/a\}bracketle{tx∗,x/a\}bracketri}ht>0 for every x∈K\{0}and Σ x∗:={x∈K:/a\}bracketle{tx∗,x/a\}bracketri}ht= 1}is a
compact convex set.
We deﬁne a partial order on Vby setting for every x, y∈V,x/√recedesequalKyify−x∈K.
In the sequel we will need to work with a monotone norm for K, that is a norm compatible
with/√recedesequalKin the sense of (10.2) below.
Let us ﬁx once and for all x∗
0∈int(K∗). Then, for every x∈V, set
/bardblx/bardblx∗
0= sup
x∗∈K∗:x∗/√recedesequalK∗x∗
0/a\}bracketle{tx∗,x/a\}bracketri}ht. (10.1)
By Lemma 11.4, /bardbl·/bardblx∗
0is a norm on Vand, using the deﬁnition of K∗,
/bardblx/bardblx0∗≤ /bardbly/bardblx∗
0∀0/√recedesequalKx/√recedesequalKy. (10.2)
Notice also that
/bardblx/bardblx∗
0=/a\}bracketle{tx∗
0,x/a\}bracketri}ht ∀x∈K. (10.3)
Recall that ( K∗)∗=K. Hence ﬁxing once and for all some x0∈int(K), with/a\}bracketle{tx∗
0,x0/a\}bracketri}ht= 1, ,
one deﬁnes also a monotone norm on V∗by setting
/bardblx∗/bardblx0:= sup
x/√recedesequalKx0|/a\}bracketle{tx∗,x/a\}bracketri}ht| ∀x∗∈V∗.
Then, for every x∗∈K∗,/bardblx∗/bardblx0=/a\}bracketle{tx∗,x0/a\}bracketri}ht.
25Set
S+:=K∩{x∈V:/bardblx/bardblx∗
0= 1}={x∈K:/a\}bracketle{tx∗
0,x/a\}bracketri}ht= 1}
and
S++:= int(K)∩{x∈V:/bardblx/bardblx∗
0= 1}={x∈int(K) :/a\}bracketle{tx∗
0,x/a\}bracketri}ht= 1}.
Notice that those deﬁnitions are consistent with (2.1) and (2.2), ta kingx∗
0= (1,...,1).
We shall now deﬁne an application don (K\{0})2that will make ( S+,d) a metric space.
We ﬁrst deﬁne an equivalence relation ∼KonK, by setting for every x, y,x∼Kyif there
exists 0< α≤βsuch thatαx/√recedesequalKy/√recedesequalβx. The equivalence classes for ∼Kare called partsof
K. By Lemma 11.2, int( K) is a part of K.
Givenx, y∈K\{0}, set
m(x,y) = sup{λ≥0 :λy/√recedesequalKx}.
This deﬁnition is consistent with the deﬁnition of the function mdeﬁned in Section 1 when
K= (R+)d.
Notice that if some λ >0 is such that λy/√recedesequalKxthenx−λy∈K, hencex/λ−y∈K. So
m(x,y)<+∞sinceKis closed and K∩(−K) ={0}.
In particular, using again that Kis closed,m(y,x)m(x,y)y/√recedesequalKm(y,x)x/√recedesequalKyso that
m(y,x)m(x,y)≤1.
Then, we deﬁne for every x, y∈K\{0},
d(x,y) =ϕ(m(x,y)m(y,x)),
whereϕis given by (2.5)
It follows from the deﬁnition of ∼Kthatx∼Kyif and only if m(x,y)m(y,x) = 0 if and only
ifd(x,y) = 1.
Then,d(x,y) = tanh/parenleftbig
(1/2)dH(x,y)/parenrightbig
wheredHis introduced page 26 of [29]. Actually, dH
is only deﬁned when x∼Kyto avoid situations where dH(x,y) = +∞.
Proposition 10.1. (S+,d)is a complete metric space and S++is closed. Moreover, there exists
Cx0>0such that
/bardblx−y/bardblx∗
0≤Cx∗
0d(x,y)
1−d(x,y)∀(x,y)∈S+. (10.4)
26Remark. Whenx∼Kythe right-hand side of (10.4) is ﬁnite. Otherwise, d(x,y) = 1 and the
right-hand side of (10.4) has to be interpreted as + ∞.
Proof.We ﬁrst prove that ( S+,d) is a metric space. Let x,y,z∈S+be such that x∼Kyand
y∼Kz. By Proposition 2.1.1 of [29], dH(x,z)≤dH(x,y)+dH(y,z). Using that u/ma√sto→tanh(u/2)
is subadditive, the inequality remains true with din place ofdH. If we do not have x∼Kyand
y∼Kz, thenm(x,y)m(y,x) = 0 orm(y,z)m(z,y) = 0, hence d(x,y) = 1 ord(y,z) = 1 so that
the triangle inequality is still satisﬁed.
The fact that dis a distance on S+then follows from (other statements of) Proposition
2.1.1 of [29]. The fact that ( S+,d) is complete follows from Lemma 2.5.4 of [29]. Indeed, if
(xn)n∈N⊂S+is a Cauchy sequence for d, thend(xp,xq)<1, say forq, p≥N, so that (xn)n≥N
is included in a part PofK. But, by Lemma 2.5.4 of [29], S+∩Pis complete for d.
Let us explain why S++is closed. Using similar arguments as above we see that it is enough
to prove that int( K) is a part of K, but this follows from Lemma 11.2.
(10.4) follows from (2.21) page 47 of [29], using the relation between dHandd. /square
We shall now deﬁne the analogue of the positive matrices.
Let
G:={g∈Md(R) :g(K\{0})⊂K\{0}, g(int(K))⊂int(K)}.
It follows from Lemma 11.3 that
G:={g∈Md(R) :gt(K∗\{0})⊂K∗\{0}, gt(int(K∗))⊂int(K∗)}.
In particular, g∈Gis allowable in the sense of [7] (see a) page 1527). Hence, the allowability
condition in [7] is redundant.
WeendowMd(R) withthenorm: /bardblg/bardblx∗
0:= supx∈K,/bardblx/bardblx∗
0=1/bardblgx/bardblx∗
0. The factthat thisisindeed
a norm follows from the fact that Khas non empty interior (i.e. K−K=V). Notice that for
g∈G,
/bardblg/bardblx∗
0= sup
x∈K,/a\}bracketle{tx∗
0,x/a\}bracketri}ht=1/a\}bracketle{tx∗
0,gx/a\}bracketri}ht.
Deﬁne also
G+:={g∈G:g(K\{0})⊂int(K)}.
By Lemma 10.1,
G+:={g∈G:gt(K∗\{0})⊂int(K∗)}.
27Deﬁne for every g∈G

0(g) = inf

Notice that for g∈G,v(g) = inf x∈K,/a\}bracketle{tx∗
0,x/a\}bracketri}ht=1/a\}bracketle{tx∗
0,gx/a\}bracketri}ht.
We then deﬁne Nx∗

0(g) :=/bardblg/bardblx∗

g·x=gx
/bardblgx/bardblx∗
0=gx
/a\}bracketle{tx∗
0,gx/a\}bracketri}ht∀(g,x)∈G×S+.
We then deﬁne a cocyle by setting σ(g,x) = log(/bardblgx/bardblx∗
0) for every ( g,x)∈G×S+.
For everyg∈Gset
c(g) := sup
x,y∈K\{0}d(gx,gy).
Proposition 10.2. For every (g,g′,x,y)∈G2×(S+)2we have
(i)|σ(g,x)| ≤logN(g);
(ii)|σ(g,x)−σ(g,y)| ≤2Cx∗

(v)c(g)≤1andc(g)<1iﬀg∈G+;
(vi)d(g·x,g·y)≤c(g)d(x,y).
Remark. The constant C >0 appearing in item ( ii) is the same as in (10.4).
Proof.(i) is obvious. ( ii) may be proved exactly as item ( i) of Lemma 5.3 of [23], using (10.4).
Let us prove ( iii). Letx,y∈S+. Assume that x∼Ky, since otherwise the right-hand side
in item (iii) equals + ∞and the inequality is clear. We have m(x,y)y/√recedesequalKxandm(y,x)x/√recedesequalKy.
Sinceg∈G,m(x,y)gy/√recedesequalKgxandm(y,x)gx/√recedesequalKgy. Using that /bardbl · /bardblx∗
0is monotone we infer
thatm(x,y)/bardblgy/bardblx∗
0≤ /bardblgx/bardblx∗
0andm(y,x)/bardblgx/bardblx∗
0≤ /bardbly/bardblgx∗
0. Hence
m(x,y)≤/bardblgx/bardblx∗
0
/bardbly/bardblx∗
0≤1/m(y,x).
Then, the proof may be ﬁnished as the proof of item ( ii) of Lemma 5.3 of [23].
28The proof of ( iv) may be done exactly as in [23]. For the proof of ( v) we need to check some
of the arguments.
Letg∈G+. Then,gS+is a compact set (for /bardbl · /bardblx∗
0) of int(K). Let us prove that is also
compact for d. Let (xn)n∈N⊂S+. Taking a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that there
existsy∈int(K) such that ( gxn)n∈Nconverges for /bardbl · /bardblx0toy. Sincey∈int(K), by Lemma
2.5.5 of [29], ( xn)n∈Nconverges to yfordH, hence for d.
The rest of the proof is as in [23].
Item (vi) is just Birkhoﬀ’s inequality, see for instance page 31 of [29]. /square
We shall now consider the analogous statements as those given in Le mma 2.2. Only item ( ii)
requires a proof.
Lemma 10.3. There exists C >0such that for every g∈G,

11 Technical results
The next lemma is just Lemma 1.2.4 of [29].
Lemma 11.1. LetKbe a closed solid cone. Then

In particular,
29The next lemma follows from the proof Lemma 1.2.4 of [29]. We recall th e short argument.
Lemma 11.2. Let/bardbl ·/bardblbe a norm on V=Rd. LetKbe a closed solid cone. Then, for every
x∈int(K), there exists ε>0, such that for every y∈K∩¯B(0,1), where¯B(0,1)is the closure
of the unit ball B(0,1), we havey/√recedesequal1

ε. In particular, int(K)is a part of K.
Proof.Letx∈int(K). There exists ε >0 such that ¯B(x,ε)⊂int(K). Lety∈¯B/bardbl·/bardbl(0,1).
Then,x−εy∈K, which means precisely that y/√recedesequal1
εx. In particular, if x, y∈int(K),x∼Ky.
It remains to prove that for every ( x,y)∈int(K=×K,x∼Ky⇒y∈int(K).
Hence, letx∈int(K). There exists ε>0 suchB(x,ε)⊂K.
Lety∈Kbe such that y∼Kx. There exists α>0 such that x/√recedesequalKαy. Soαy−x∈Kand
αy=x+αy−x∈ ∪z∈K(z+B(x,ε)),
which is an open subset of K. /square
Lemma 11.3. Letg∈Md(R)and letKbe a closed solid cone of E.
(i)g(K\{0})⊂K\{0}if and only if gt(int(K∗))⊂int(K∗);
(ii)g(int(K))⊂int(K)if and only if gt(K∗\{0})⊂K∗\{0}.
Proof.Assume that g(K\{0})⊂K\{0}. Letx∗∈int(K∗) andx∈K\{0}. We have
/a\}bracketle{tgtx∗,x/a\}bracketri}ht=/a\}bracketle{tx∗,gx/a\}bracketri}ht>0,
by Lemma 11.1. Using Lemma 11.1 again, we see that gtx∗∈int(K∗).
Assume that gt(int(K∗))⊂int(K∗). Letx∈K\{0}andx∗∈int(K∗). We have
/a\}bracketle{tx∗,gx/a\}bracketri}ht=/a\}bracketle{tgtx∗,x/a\}bracketri}ht>0.
Hencegx∈K∗∗=K(see Exercise 2.31 of [5]) and gx/\e}atio\slash= 0, which proves item ( i).
Item (ii) is just item ( i) forK∗using thatK∗∗=K. /square
Lemma 11.4. /bardbl·/bardblx∗
0deﬁned by (10.1)is a norm for every x∗
0∈int(K∗).
Proof.By Lemma 1.2.5 of [29], the set {x∗∈K:x∗/√recedesequalK∗x∗
0}is bounded, hence /bardbl·/bardblx∗
0is ﬁnite
onV. The fact that /bardbl·/bardblx∗
0satisﬁes the triangular inequality and is positively homogeneous are
obvious.
Assume that x∈E, is such that /bardblx/bardblx∗
0= 0. By Lemma 11.2 applied to K∗(withx=x∗
0),
for everyx∗∈K∗,/a\}bracketle{tx∗,x/a\}bracketri}ht= 0. Since K∗has non empty interior, K∗−K∗=V∗andx= 0./square
