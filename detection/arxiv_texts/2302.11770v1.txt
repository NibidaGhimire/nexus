Abstract: The Escherichia coli chemotaxis signaling pathway has served as a model system for
studying the adaptive sensing of environmental signals by large protein complexes. The chemore-
ceptors control the kinase activity of CheA in response to the extracellular ligand concentration and
adapt across a wide concentration range by undergoing methylation and demethylation. Methyla-
tion shifts the kinase response curve by orders of magnitude in ligand concentration while incurring a
much smaller change in the ligand binding curve. Here, we show that this asymmetric shift in bind-
ing and kinase response is inconsistent with equilibrium allosteric models regardless of parameter
choices. To resolve this inconsistency, we present a nonequilibrium allosteric model that explicitly
includes the dissipative reaction cycles driven by ATP hydrolysis. The model successfully explains
all existing measurements for both aspartate and serine receptors. Our results suggest that while
ligand binding controls the equilibrium balance between the ON and OFF states of the kinase,
receptor methylation modulates the kinetic properties (e.g., the phosphorylation rate) of the ON
state. Furthermore, suﬃcient energy dissipation is necessary for maintaining and enhancing the
sensitivity range and amplitude of the kinase response. We demonstrate that the nonequilibrium al-
losteric model is broadly applicable to other sensor-kinase systems by successfully ﬁtting previously
unexplained data from the DosP bacterial oxygen-sensing system. Overall, this work provides a new
perspective on cooperative sensing by large protein complexes and opens up new research directions
for understanding their microscopic mechanisms through simultaneous measurements and modeling
of ligand binding and downstream responses.
Signiﬁcance: Adaptation in bacterial chemotaxis is carried out by receptor methylation, which
shifts the kinase response curve by orders of magnitude in ligand concentration. However, the
receptor-ligand binding curve is only shifted slightly by receptor methylation. We show that this
discrepancy in shifts rules out the previously proposed equilibrium allosteric models for the system.
We develop a nonequilibrium model that explicitly includes the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation
cycle driven by ATP hydrolysis. Our model agrees with all the existing experiments and shows
that while ligand binding aﬀects the ON/OFF switching of the kinase activity, receptor methylation
aﬀects the ON-state kinetics. Our study also shows that a minimum energy dissipation is needed
to maintain the observed sensitivity range and amplitude of the kinase response.
INTRODUCTION
Most biological machines that are responsible for im-
portant functions are made of multiple components (pro-
teins and RNAs) that work together in a cooperative
manner. Examples include the ribosome for protein
synthesis [1] and the bacterial ﬂagellar motor for lo-
comotion [2]. One of the most important models in
describing the cooperative function of a large protein
complex with multiple subunits is the Monod-Wyman-
Changeux (MWC) model [3]. Originally developed to
describe cooperative allosteric interactions in a multi-
subunit enzyme such as hemoglobin [3, 4], it has been
extended to describe signal transduction [5] in large pro-
tein complexes such as the bacterial chemoreceptor clus-
ter with heterogeneous components [6–8] and gene regu-
lation by transcription regulators [9] (see the recent book
by Phillips [10] for a comprehensive review). However,
despite its many successes, the MWC model is highly sim-
pliﬁed, assuming equilibrium interactions between com-ponents of the protein complex and a two-state (all-or-
none) behavior for the entire complex. We now know
that many biological machines operate out of equilibrium
through the hydrolysis of energy-rich molecules such as
nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) including ATP and GTP.
Moreover, rich structural information of these complexes
has been revealed by high-resolution imaging techniques
such as cryo-electron tomography [11, 12]. In light of this
new information, it becomes necessary to examine the va-
lidity of the MWC assumptions and to elucidate whether
the MWC model still provides a faithful description of
the underlying process in these protein complexes.
Here, we reexamine the applicability of the MWC
model to signal transduction in chemoreceptor clus-
ters found in almost all bacteria [13]. Bacteria use
these membrane-bound chemoreceptors to sense and
to respond to changes in their environments, such
as chemical concentrations, temperature, pH, and os-
motic pressure [14]. There are around 20,000 methyl-
accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCP) in an EscherichiaarXiv:2302.11770v1  [physics.bio-ph]  23 Feb 20232
coli cell [15]. They form large clusters near the cell
poles [16] and serve important cellular functions such
as signal ampliﬁcation [17–19] and enhancing adapta-
tion [20–22]. Together with quantitative functional ex-
periments, modeling work using variations of the MWC
model has played an important role in understanding the
mechanisms underlying key functions such as signal inte-
gration, adaptation, and ampliﬁcation [23, 24].
The E. coli chemotaxis signaling pathway in-
volves receptor complexes composed of membrane-bound
chemoreceptors, cytoplasmic histidine kinase CheA, and
an adaptor protein CheW. The complex transduces the
signal induced by the binding of ligands to the chemore-
ceptors to the kinase activity of CheA, which modulates
the swimming behavior of the bacterium by phosphory-
lating the intracellular response regulator CheY. In order
to remain sensitive at varying levels of external stimuli,
the kinase activity is modulated by an adaptation mech-
anism. Adaptation is achieved by the methylation and
demethylation of the chemoreceptor catalyzed by CheR
and CheB, respectively.
The kinase response of the complex can be successfully
described by a generalized MWC model [7], which cap-
tures the signiﬁcant change in the sensitivity of kinase
response as receptor methylation level changes. Since
the MWC model is an equilibrium model that satis-
ﬁes detailed balance in all transitions between internal
states, it predicts that varying the receptor methylation
level should induce similar changes in both ligand occu-
pancy and kinase response [25]. However, this prediction
is inconsistent with in vitro experiments by Borkovitch
et al. [26] and Amin and Hazelbauer [27] for aspartate
receptors (Tar) and by Levit and Stock [28] for serine
receptors (Tsr), which showed that while changes in re-
ceptor methylation shift the kinase response curve over a
signiﬁcant range of ligand concentration, the correspond-
ing shift in ligand occupancy is much smaller. Moreover,
Vaknin and Berg [29] measured the receptor response in
vivoin the absence of both the histidine kinase CheA and
linker protein CheW. As the methylation level increases,
they again found a much smaller shift in the response of
bare receptor oligomers than that of the kinase response
of the full complex. So far, this fundamental discrepancy
remains unexplained.
In this paper, we present a nonequilibrium model that
explains both the ligand binding and the kinase activ-
ity for diﬀerent receptor methylation levels. First, we
develop a parametric test, which systematically demon-
strates that the existing measurements cannot be con-
sistently explained by the MWC model or similar equi-
librium models. This motivates us to develop a new
nonequilibrium model, which extends the MWC ap-
proach by adding a kinetic description of the ATP-
driven phosphorylation-dephosphorylation(PdP) cycle of
the downstream signaling molecule CheY controlled by
the kinase CheA and the phosphatase CheZ. The modelis capable of consistently ﬁtting all available measure-
ments of ligand binding, receptor conformation, and ki-
nase activity for E. coli chemotaxis [27–29]. Crucially,
the experimentally observed behavior is only enabled by
a suﬃciently strong nonequilibrium driving in the PdP
cycle, which is provided by ATP hydrolysis. If the driv-
ing is below certain thresholds, the model fails to si-
multaneously capture ligand binding and kinase activity,
especially the discrepancy in their shifts when receptor
methylation level changes. Finally, this nonequilibrium
allosteric model should be generally applicable to other
signaling pathways involving dissipation, in particular,
sensor-kinase systems that are driven out of equilibrium
by the PdP cycle. Indeed, the model successfully cap-
tures both the binding and kinase activity measurements
in the bacterial oxygen-sensing system DosP [30].
RESULTS
Equilibrium allosteric models fail to explain both
ligand binding and kinase response
To start, we focus on the in vitro measurements by
Amin and Hazelbauer on Tar receptors embedded in na-
tive membrane vesicles [27]. The receptors were ﬁxed
at diﬀerent levels of methylation by substituting gluta-
mates (E) with glutamine (Q) at the receptor methyl-
accepting sites. By comparing dose-response curves of
receptors with zero or three modiﬁcations, it was found
that methylation shifts the kinase response curve signif-
icantly but only induces a much smaller shift in ligand
binding (see Fig. 1B).
Before introducing the nonequilibrium allosteric
model, we ﬁrst examine whether the behaviors (especially
ligand binding and kinase activity) of the chemoreceptors
can be consistently described by an equilibrium allosteric
model. To this end, we present a parametric test that sys-
tematically detects inconsistency between the measure-
ments and the MWC model without ﬁtting the data to
any speciﬁc function. Other equilibrium models, such as
Ising models, can be ruled out using a similar approach
(see SI Appendix).
In the MWC model, the receptor complex has Niden-
tical binding sites, whose occupancy is denoted by σi
(i= 1,2...N );σi= 0,1 represents a vacant or occupied
receptor, respectively. The receptor methylation level is
denoted by m. The MWC model assumes all-or-none
behavior for the whole complex. Namely, the receptor
activitysis either on ( s= 1) or oﬀ ( s= 0). The energy
(Hamiltonian) of the receptor complex is given by

FIG. 1. Measured aspartate binding and kinase activity of Tar receptor signaling complexes [27] are inconsistent with
equilibrium MWC models. (A) A parametric test plotting the measured aspartate receptor occupancy ( σexp) against the
inferred occupancy ˜ σ(sexp,smax,smin) from MWC model with N= 1,3, and∞and for methylation levels m= 0 and 3. The
solid curves correspond to independent Hill function ﬁts to the data, the ﬁlled circles ( /CIRCLE) are the (σexp,˜σ) pairs inferred from
binding measurements, and the open diamonds ( /Diamond) are inferred from measurements of CheY phosphorylation. The gray shaded
area shows 95% conﬁdence regions from the Hill function ﬁts. The transformed data lie far from the diagonal (black dashed
line), indicating that the system is nonequilibrium. (B) Fitting the kinase activity for m= 0 (dashed) and m= 3 (solid) with

binding, which depends on ligand concentration [ L] and
a (methylation-dependent) dissociation constant Ki(m).
Esis the energy diﬀerence between the active and in-
active receptor states in the absence of a ligand. Each
occupied binding site increases this energy diﬀerence by
E0>0, thereby suppressing activity at high occupancy.
Given the MWC Hamiltonian, the average receptor ac-
tivity is
/angbracketlefts/angbracketright=/parenleftBigg
1 +eEs/parenleftbigg1 + [L]/Ki
1 +e−E0[L]/Ki/parenrightbiggN/parenrightBigg−1
, (2)
and the average binding is
/angbracketleftσ/angbracketright=[L]
Ki+ [L](1−/angbracketlefts/angbracketright) +[L]
eE0Ki+ [L]/angbracketlefts/angbracketright.(3)
In the limit of large Es, we have/angbracketlefts/angbracketright/lessmuch1, so the binding
curve becomes a Hill function with Hill coeﬃcient nH= 1
(no cooperative binding), consistent with experiments us-
ing vesicle-bound chemoreceptors [27]. The maximum ac-
tivitysmax= (1 + exp( Es))−1is reached at [ L] = 0, and
the minimum activity smin= (1 + exp( Es+NE0))−1oc-
curs at [L] =∞.
The MWC model has seen great success in capturing
the methylation-dependence of the downstream CheY-
P response [7, 25], even in the presence of time-varying
stimuli [31]. These studies suggest the following basic
mechanism: methylation aﬀects the energy for the ac-
tive state,Es(m), and thereby shifts the kinase response
curves across orders of magnitude in ligand concentra-
tion. However, this mechanism does not take into ac-
count measurements of ligand binding.Here, we examine whether the binding and activity
curves measured at the same methylation level are both
compatible with the equilibrium MWC model. This can
be done by eliminating the concentration variable [ L]
from Eqs. (2) and (3) to obtain a parametric relation
between/angbracketlefts/angbracketrightand/angbracketleftσ/angbracketright. For example, solving Eq. (2) for [ L]
and substituting the solution into Eq. (3) gives the mean
occupancy as a function of the receptor activity,
/angbracketleftσ/angbracketright= ˜σ(/angbracketlefts/angbracketright,smin,smax), (4)
wheresmaxandsminare the maximum and minimum ac-
tivity mentioned above, which can be determined from
experimental measurements of kinase activity. For any
ﬁxedN,smaxandsminuniquely determine the value of
the energy parameters E0andEs, which gives ˜ σas a
function of (/angbracketlefts/angbracketright,smax,smin). The expression of ˜ σfor ﬁnite
Ncan be complicated, but its behavior can be illustrated
in small and large Nlimits. For N= 1, the equilibrium
model simpliﬁes to ˜ σ= (smax−/angbracketlefts/angbracketright)/(smax−smin), which
equates ligand binding with the normalized kinase activ-
ity. On the other hand, for large N, the inferred receptor
occupancy converges to
˜σ= logsmax(1−/angbracketlefts/angbracketright)
/angbracketlefts/angbracketright(1−smax)/slashbigg
logsmax(1−smin)
smin(1−smax).(5)
The curves for intermediate Nlie between these two ex-
treme limits.
To test the validity of the equilibrium MWC model, we
transform the measured kinase response curves for two
diﬀerent methylation levels [27] according to Eq. (4) and
plot the inferred occupancy (˜ σ) against the correspond-
ing measurements of the receptor occupancy ( σexp) [32].4
If the equilibrium model is valid, all the points should
collapse onto the diagonal σ= ˜σfor some choice of N.
However, the data for both methylation levels ( m= 0,3)
lie well oﬀ the diagonal for any choice of N(Fig. 1A),
indicating that the system (even for a single methyla-
tion level) cannot be described by the equilibrium MWC
model with any N.
The intuition behind this inconsistency is that the
MWC model cannot capture the relative shift between
binding and response curves. To demonstrate this, we
ﬁt the MWC model only to the measured kinase activity
(CheY-P level) and compare the resulting binding and
activity curves with experiments (Fig. 1B). The MWC
model successfully captures kinase activity (upper panel)
but does not produce the correct binding curves (lower
panel). Instead, it predicts that the increase in bind-
ing and the decrease in kinase activity should occur at
around the same ligand concentration. This prediction is
inconsistent with experiments, which found the sharpest
change in kinase activity occurring at a concentration
that is either much lower ( m= 0) or higher ( m= 3)
than that of binding. Moreover, as the methylation level
changes from m= 0 tom= 3, the shift in activity curves
is much greater than the shift in binding curves. These
results suggest that the MWC model is unable to cap-
ture the data either at a single methylation level or the
change between diﬀerent methylation levels. Similarly,
ﬁtting the MWC model to the measured binding curves
results in discrepancies with the measured kinase activ-
ity (see SI Appendix). Note that these ﬁttings are only
shown to build intuition. They are all encompassed by
the parametric test (Fig. 1A), which oﬀers stronger ev-
idence by revealing inconsistency with the MWC model
without relying on ﬁtting with any assumptions or any
particular formulation of the loss function.
Similar results hold for more complex equilibrium mod-
els: for example, if we treat the measured kinase activity
aas a separate degree of freedom from the receptor ac-
tivitys. Assuming the two activities are coupled by equi-
librium mechanisms, with the active receptor promoting
kinase phosphorylation, we add the following terms to
the MWC Hamiltonian,
Ha= (F0+ ∆Fs)a, (6)
whereF0is the energy of the active kinase when the
receptor is inactive and F1=F0+∆F <F 0is the energy
when the receptor is active. The average activities of the
joint Hamiltonian H+Haare linearly related,
amax−/angbracketlefta/angbracketright
amax−amin=smax−/angbracketlefts/angbracketright
smax−smin. (7)
Therefore, our analysis above also applies to equilibrium
models with additional binary degrees of freedom. In the
SI Appendix, we show that this linear relation holds for
arbitrary chains of binary variables coupled via equilib-rium interactions. Hence, these types of models are also
inconsistent with the experiments.
Beyond MWC models, the binding and kinase response
cannot be simultaneously captured by equilibrium Ising-
type models (for various spatial structures), where the
receptor activities siare variable across the receptor com-
plex (see SI Appendix).
A nonequilibrium allosteric model captures both
ligand binding and kinase activity for Tar
The fact that equilibrium models cannot capture the
binding and kinase response measurements indicates that
theE. coli chemotaxis signaling pathway operates out of
equilibrium. We now present a nonequilibrium allosteric
model that extends the MWC model and can simultane-
ously capture the measured binding and response curves
as well as their asymmetric shifts due to methylation.
In this model (pictured in Fig. 2A), the receptor
conformation is again represented as a binary variable
swith inactive (0) and active (1) states. It is cou-
pled to ligand occupancy σiby an equilibrium MWC
model. The phosphorylation state of the response regula-
tor CheY is represented by a new binary variable a, with
dephosphorylated (0) and phosphorylated (1) states.
The measured CheY-P concentration is proportional to
the average phosphorylation variable /angbracketlefta/angbracketright. The transi-
tions between states a= 0,1 involve phosphorylation-
dephosphorylation (PdP) cycles (blue boxes), whose re-
action rates depend on both the conformation sand the
methylation m. The system operates out of equilibrium
sustained by continuous ATP hydrolysis in the PdP cy-
cle, and the average receptor behavior is determined by
the probability distribution P(a,s) of the nonequilibrium
steady state.
When the receptor is active ( s= 1), it catalyzes the
phosphorylation of CheY through the autophosphoryla-
tion of the histidine kinase CheA, which subsequently
transfers the phosphate group to CheY. In our model,
we do not consider all the detailed steps of phospho-
transfer from ATP to CheY and assign an overall rate
k1to describe the phosphorylation of CheY. For sim-
plicity, we also assume that the phosphorylation rate is
negligible when the receptor is inactive ( s= 0). The de-
phosphorylation of CheY-P is catalyzed by CheZ, with
a dephosphorylation rate kzindependent of the receptor
state. To ensure thermodynamic consistency, all reac-
tions are reversible with reverse rates k/prime
1=k1e−G1and
k/prime
z=kze−Gz. The PdP cycle is driven by ATP hydrol-
ysis with free energy GATP(measured in units of kBT),
which is dissipated per PdP cycle per CheY molecule.
The rates obey the thermodynamic constraint:

FIG. 2. The nonequilibrium allosteric model for the chemoreceptor. (A) Schematics of the model. The receptor conformation
(s) is coupled to the ligand occupancy at Nbinding sites ( σi,i= 1,2,...,N ) via an equilibrium interaction described by the
MWC model with the energy function HMWC . The receptor switches between ON and OFF states at rates ωandω/prime, which
depend on the ligand occupancy. The CheY phosphorylation state ais controlled by the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation
(PdP) cycle driven by ATP hydrolysis. The phosphorylation is catalyzed by the active receptor ( s= 1) with a rate k1(we
assume the phosphorylation rate to be negligible in the OFF state, k0=k/prime
0= 0). The dephosphorylation of CheY-P is catalyzed
by CheZ with a rate kz, independent of the receptor state. (B) The model captures both the measured CheY-P level (upper)
and aspartate binding (lower) for Tar receptors. N= 10,GATP= 20,Es= 5. All experimental data are from Amin and
Hazelbauer [27].

Motivated by structural details of the bacterial
chemoreceptors (see Discussion), we assume that recep-
tor methylation can aﬀect kinase activity by changing
the energy barrier in the phosphorylation reaction, which
scalesk1andk/prime

hand, the dephosphorylation rate kzremains indepen-
dent ofm. The ratio of the two rates can be written
as:k1/kz= exp [Ep−∆EB(m)], whereEpis a con-
stant and ∆ EB(m) captures the allosteric eﬀect of re-
ceptor methylation on the energy barrier for phosphory-
lation. Here, we adopt the simplest model where the en-
ergy barrier has a linear dependence on the methylation
level, i.e. ∆ EB(m) =−/epsilon1mNm. The energy diﬀerence
G1= log(k1/k/prime
1) is not aﬀected by methylation.
The receptor conformation scan switch between ON
and OFF states at rates ωandω/prime, whose ratio is de-
ﬁned asα=ω/ω/prime. Throughout our analysis, switching
is assumed to be much faster than the PdP reactions
(ω,ω/prime/greatermuchk1,kz), which means sis in fast equilibrium
withσ. Since the coupling between sandσdoes not in-
volve any nonequilibrium driving, we can describe it with
the MWC free energy (Eq. 1). Matching the switching
dynamics to the MWC model gives the rate ratio:

In the large dissipation (strong nonequilibrium driv-

This expression has the same form as the MWC activity
Eq. (2) with a new eﬀective energy for the active state
Eeﬀ
s=Es−Ep−/epsilon1Nm , which depends on the methy-
lation level m. Given that the MWC model [Eq. (2)]
has been successfully employed to ﬁt the CheY-P curves
(Fig. 1B), we can expect a similar, if not better, ﬁt
from the nonequilibrium model. Indeed, Fig. 2B shows
that the model successfully captures the CheY-P level of
vesicle-bound Tar receptors at all ﬁve methylation lev-
els [27].
Since there is no feedback from the CheY phosphory-
lation state to the receptor, the average receptor confor-
mation/angbracketlefts/angbracketrightand ligand occupancy /angbracketleftσ/angbracketrightare given by the
MWC model, Eqs. (2) and (3) respectively. For large Es,
we again have/angbracketlefts/angbracketright/lessmuch1 so that the binding curve closely
resembles a Hill function with Hill coeﬃcient nH= 1.
Fig. 2B shows that the same set of parameters used to ﬁt
kinase response also produces the correct binding curves,
which is a signiﬁcant improvement from the MWC model.6
Why is the nonequilibrium model able to capture the
asymmetric shift of binding and kinase response curves
due to methylation while equilibrium models cannot? In
equilibrium models, methylation can only aﬀect recep-
tor behavior through thermodynamic control, i.e. by
changing the energy diﬀerence between diﬀerent states
throughEsandE0. Since equilibrium interactions are
always reciprocal (symmetric), the fact that ligand bind-
ing controls receptor activity means that there has to
be an equally strong feedback from the receptor state
to the ligand occupancy. Therefore, this type of control
shifts the binding and kinase response curves by similar
amounts, inconsistent with experimental observations.
In the nonequilibrium model, however, the interaction
between ligand binding and kinase activity can be non-
reciprocal (asymmetric): the receptor complex acts as an
enzyme that exerts kinetic control by changing the phos-
phorylation energy barrier ∆ EB(m). In the absence of
strong feedback from the substrate (CheY) to the recep-
tor complex, these changes in the energy barrier enable
ampliﬁed shifts in the kinase response while maintaining
modest shifts in binding response. For this mechanism
to function, however, the system must be driven out of
equilibrium (in this case by continuous ATP hydrolysis).
Energy dissipation is required to enable kinetic control,
which has no impact on the steady-state distribution if
the system is in equilibrium, and is necessary to main-
tain the asymmetric coupling between the phosphoryla-
tion stateaand the receptor state s. As shown later,
the response amplitude vanishes in the absence of energy
dissipation.
Further conﬁrmation of the nonequilibrium
model: Receptor conformational changes
and the Tsr receptor
In addition to explaining the asymmetric shifts in bind-
ing (σ) and kinase response ( a) curves, our model also
predicts diﬀerent dose-response curves for the receptor
conformation ( s) and kinase response ( a). Vaknin and
Berg measured Tar receptor conformation in vivo by fus-
ing ﬂuorescent proteins to the C-termini of chemorecep-
tors and measuring the intensity of ﬂuorescence reso-
nance energy transfer (FRET) between receptor homod-
imers [29]. They measured the receptor conformation for
mutants with ﬁxed methylation states EEEE ( m= 0)
and QQQQ ( m= 4) and the corresponding kinase re-
sponse for QQQQ ( m= 4) andcheR+cheB+mutants.
ThecheR+cheB+cells do not have a ﬁxed methylation
state, but their kinase response is known to be similar to
QEEE mutants ( m= 1) [31]. The shift of the kinase re-
sponse curve from m= 1 tom= 4 was found to be much
more signiﬁcant than the shift of the receptor conforma-
tion curve from m= 0 tom= 4 (Fig. 3A, circles ver-
sus triangles). Note that the conformation measurements

were carried out in the absence of kinase CheA and linker
protein CheW, which leads to noncooperative responses
(N= 1). Similar to the in vitro case discussed above,
the discrepancy between the dose-response curves sug-
gests the necessity for a nonequilibrium allosteric model.
Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3A, the model simultaneously
ﬁts both the receptor conformation and kinase response
curves for all mutants (solid and dashed lines).
Another abundant chemoreceptor in E. coli is the ser-
ine receptor Tsr, which regulates CheY phosphorylation
using the same microscopic mechanisms as the Tar re-
ceptor. Levit and Stock [28] measured the binding and
kinase response for Tsr receptor complexes with three
diﬀerent receptor methylation levels (Fig. 3B). This was
achieved by expressing the WT receptor without CheR
or CheB to ﬁx its methylation level and subsequently
increasing the methylation level by adding CheR and
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) or decreasing the methy-
lation level by adding CheB c, the catalytic domain of
CheB. As the methylation level varied between these
three conditions, the serine concentration required to in-
hibit kinase activity varied by more than two orders of
magnitude, while the binding aﬃnity only changed by
two-fold (from Kd= 10µM toKd= 20µM). The asym-
metric shift in binding and kinase response curves of Tsr
receptors is similar to that found for Tar receptors, which
is inconsistent with equilibrium models. Once again, the
discrepancy between these shifts can be fully captured by
the nonequilibrium allosteric model (Fig. 3B, solid and
dashed lines).7
The minimum dissipation and the critical eﬀects of
nonequilibrium driving
Our results above show that strong nonequilibrium
driving, which is provided by the free energy released dur-
ing ATP hydrolysis ( GATP), is necessary to produce the
experimentally observed large shifts in kinase response
curves with changes in receptor methylation level (or
other forms of modiﬁcation to the receptor) while leav-
ing ligand binding relatively unchanged. This raises the
question of how much energy dissipation is required for
the system to exhibit behaviors that match the experi-
mentally observed ligand binding and kinase response.
To address this question, we evaluate the diﬀerence be-
tween the average phosphorylation level /angbracketlefta/angbracketright(proportional
to the CheY-P concentration) and its value in the inﬁnite
dissipation limit/angbracketlefta/angbracketright∞[given by Eq. (11)] by expanding
the full solution to the nonequilibrium model [Eq. (10)]
in terms of the reverse reaction rates k/prime

wherePON=α/(1 +α) is the probability of the re-
ceptor being in the ON state ( s= 1). The two terms
in the parenthesis have clear physical meanings: they
quantify the irreversibility of the PdP cycle by compar-
ing the reaction rates along or against the nonequilib-
rium driving (yellow arrow in Fig. 2A). The ﬁrst term
k/prime
z/k1is the ratio between the reverse dephosphorylation
ratek/prime
z(counterclockwise transition) and the phospho-
rylation rate (clockwise transition) originating from the
CheY state ( a= 0). Similarly, the second term k/prime
1/kzis
the ratio between reverse phosphorylation (counterclock-
wise) and dephosphorylation (clockwise) reactions from
the CheY-P state ( a= 1). Since phosphorylation only
occurs in the ON state, while dephosphorylation occurs
independent of the receptor state, each term is weighted
by an appropriate factor of PON. To make each of these
terms small requires large GzandG1(and hence large
GATP) to drive the PdP cycle suﬃciently irreversibly so
that the system behaves close to the inﬁnite-dissipation
limit.
To quantify the minimum required dissipation GATP,
we start with Eq. (12) and focus on the extreme cases
m= 0 andm= 4, whose response curves envelop
those of intermediate m. Form= 0, the CheY-P re-
sponse is suppressed: the phosphorylation rate k1=
kzexp(Ep) is much less than the dephosphorylation rate
kz(Ep≈−4 for our best ﬁt in Fig. 2), so the ﬁrst term in
Eq. (12) dominates. We want the error to be small com-
pared to the maximal inﬁnite-dissipation activity, i.e.,
|δ/angbracketlefta/angbracketright/max(/angbracketlefta/angbracketright∞)|< dthfor some loss threshold dth,
where max(/angbracketlefta/angbracketright∞) = (1 +eEskz/k1)−1. SinceEsis largeand therefore αis small, this leads to k/prime
z/(k1α)<dth, or
Gz>(−Ep+Es)−log(dth). (13)
Conversely, for m= 4, the CheY-P response is ampli-
ﬁed by the kinetic barrier shift due to methylation, and
we havek1=kzexp(Ep+ 4/epsilon1mN)/greatermuchkz. Therefore,
the second term in Eq. (12) dominates. Again requir-
ing this term is small compared to the maximal inﬁnite-
dissipation activity leads to k/prime
1/k1<dth, or
G1>−log(dth). (14)
Adding these two inequalities gives an operation thresh-
old forGATP,
GATP>G min=−Ep+Es−2 log(dth). (15)
From our ﬁts, Ep−Es≈−4, so using a threshold of
dth= 10−2leads toGmin= 13.2, which is the minimum
dissipation energy needed to drive the system to have the
experimentally observed behaviors shown in Fig. 2B.
As given in Eq. (8), the total dissipation energy ( GATP)
can be decomposed into two parts: GATP =G1+Gz
whereG1andGzare used to suppress the reverse re-
actions for the phosphorylation and the dephosphoryla-
tion processes, respectively. In the inﬁnite dissipation
limit with G1,Gz→ ∞ , all the reverse reactions can
be neglected, and we obtain the exact expression for the
kinase activity given in Eq. (11), which agrees quantita-
tively with the experiments. For ﬁnite values of G1and
Gz, the behavior of the model can be diﬀerent. The dif-
ference between the phosphorylation levels at ﬁnite and
inﬁnite dissipation can be quantiﬁed by
d(G1,Gz) =4/summationdisplay
m=0wm/radicalbigg/angbracketleftBig

(16)
where the weight wm= 1//angbracketlefta/angbracketright∞(m,0) normalizes curves
by the inﬁnite-dissipation maximal activity at the corre-
sponding methylation state, and the average is calculated
by sampling uniformly over the activity range of /angbracketlefta/angbracketright∞.
Fig. 4A shows d(G1,Gz) for diﬀerent values of G1and
Gz. As expected, the diﬀerence is small in the upper
right region when both G1andGzare suﬃciently large,
which deﬁnes the operational regime of the chemorecep-
tor sensory system. The estimated thresholds Eqs. (13)
and (14), shown by white dashed lines, accurately pre-
dict when the models have quantitatively similar kinase
activity. Moreover, they are indeed limited by methyla-
tion levelsm= 0 andm= 4 as shown by the contours of
the output discrepancy for individual methylation levels
(white solid lines). The blue dashed line shows the op-
erational threshold Gmin= 13.2, where the diﬀerence is
only small for a particular pair of ( G1,Gz). In contrast,
for a typical physiological value GATP = 20 [33] (blue
solid line), ( G1,Gz) is allowed to vary within a much8

larger range without deviating from the experimentally
observed kinase response.
Next, we investigate the role of energy dissipation in
the signaling pathway. In particular, we ﬁnd that it en-
hances the amplitude and the sensitivity range of the
response. To illustrate this, we tune the nonequilibrium
drivingGATP and track how it aﬀects the CheY-P re-
sponse amplitude and the half-maximum aspartate con-
centration ( k1/2) for each methylation level. To demon-
strate their typical behaviors, we consider two paths
shown by the purple arrows in Fig. 4A, with the corre-
sponding responses shown in Fig. 4B and C. Both paths
start from GATP = 20 (G1=Gz= 10) and move to-
wards the equilibrium limit ( GATP = 0) by decreasing
G1with ﬁxedGzand vice versa. In each case, the am-
plitude decreases to zero as the dissipation approaches
zero. Indeed, the receptor state aﬀects CheY phospho-
rylation through kinetic control, which has no eﬀect in
the equilibrium limit. Furthermore, non-zero dissipation
enables the large spread in CheY-P response curves. Be-
cause our model has no feedback from the phosphory-
lation state to the receptor, and therefore no response
in equilibrium, the response curves snap together sud-
denly when GATP= 0. For the response to be nonzero
in the equilibrium limit, there has to be feedback from
CheY to the receptor. Thus, the relation Eq. (7) holds
and the spread between kinase response curves must be
comparable to that for binding curves. Interestingly, the
k1/2scaling is qualitatively diﬀerent depending on the
path taken to equilibrium: varying G1leads to both
non-monotonic behavior, with k1/2initially increasing for
eachmbefore decreasing dramatically near equilibrium.
Conversely, varying Gzproduces monotonic scaling with
an initial gradual decrease in the sensitivity range beforea similar collapse at equilibrium.

A possible scheme to test our model could be to
measure kinase dose-response curves while tuning the
[ATP]/[ADP] ratio to change G1. For a ﬁxed value of Gz
within the operational regime, the response amplitude
and sensitivity range will decrease as the [ATP]/[ADP]
ratio decreases. For example, if Gz= 10, as is the case in
Fig. 4B, the response amplitude for m= 4 will decrease
by about 5% when the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio decreases by
three orders of magnitude [34]. Note that this estimate is
nearly the worst-case scenario, since our choice of initial
(G1,Gz) hasGzclose to its threshold value. If the true
Gzis larger than 10, a much larger reduction in ampli-
tude will occur for the same decrease in the [ATP]/[ADP]
ratio (e.g., 51% for Gz= 13). Furthermore, since our
model is coarse-grained (for example, it ignores inter-
mediate steps in the phosphotransfer between CheA and
CheY), the predicted dissipation rate is smaller than that
of the real system [35, 36]. Therefore, the real kinase
response may be more susceptible to changes in ATP
concentration than the model predicts. Another possi-
ble scheme to test our model is to vary Gzby control-
ling the inorganic phosphate concentration [ Pi] as shown9
in Fig. 4C. Quantitative measurements of the amplitude
and sensitivity range using one of the proposed schemes
above may help more precisely pinpoint the operational
regime of chemoreceptor signaling complexes.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have developed a nonequilibrium al-
losteric model of bacterial chemoreceptors motivated by
the asymmetric shifts in ligand binding and kinase re-
sponse curves caused by receptor methylation, which has
been a long-standing puzzle in the ﬁeld. The model ex-
plains all existing measurements of ligand binding, recep-
tor conformation, and kinase response within a uniﬁed
framework that takes into account both allosteric inter-
actions within the receptor-kinase complex as well as the
nonequilibrium phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reac-
tion kinetics driven by energy dissipation.
How intracellular energy is used to drive information
and signaling processes in living cells is a fundamental
question in biological physics. Recently, much progress
have been made in elucidating the critical eﬀects of en-
ergy dissipation in a wide range of cellular functions such
as the ultrasensitive bacterial ﬂagellar motor switch [37],
accurate sensory adaptation [38], error correction [39, 40],
gene expression control [41], and biochemical oscillation
and synchronization [42, 43]. Here, by combining ex-
perimental data and theoretical modeling, we show that
strong dissipation, fueled by ATP hydrolysis, is neces-
sary for enhancing the response amplitude and sensitivity
range of the sensor-kinase signaling process.
Below, we discuss the possible microscopic mechanism
underlying the nonequilibrium allosteric model, the gen-
erality of our model, and some future directions to extend
our model.
Possible microscopic mechanism: ligand binding and
methylation cause diﬀerent conformation changes
The proposed microscopic mechanism underlying the
nonequilibrium allosteric model is summarized in Fig. 5.
The average phosphorylation state of the response regu-
lator CheY is controlled by the methyl-accepting chemo-
taxis proteins (MCP, blue box) through CheA and CheW
(green box). The MCP can undergo multiple distinct
conformational changes (denoted by sand ˜s), each of
which aﬀects the phosphorylation rate of CheY in diﬀer-
ent ways.
The conformation sis predominantly controlled by lig-
and binding ( σ) via an equilibrium mechanism captured
by the MWC energy function HMWC (methylation may
have a minor eﬀect on sthroughKi,Es, or both). When
s= 0, the receptor is in the OFF state with almost no
kinase activity, which is equivalent to having a very large

model. The receptor can undergo two separate conforma-
tional changes sand ˜s, in response to ligand binding and
methylation, respectively. Each conformation aﬀects the
phosphorylation of CheY through CheA, but in diﬀerent
ways:scontrols switching between the kinase OFF state, with
no phosphorylation of CheY, and ON state, which has a ﬁ-
nite energy barrier for phosphorylation. In the ON state, ˜ s(m)
lowers the energy barrier EB(by diﬀerent amounts ∆ EB(m)
depending on the methylation level) to increase the phos-
phorylation rate. The phosphorylation reaction, controlled
through these two mechanisms, together with dephosphory-
lation catalyzed by CheZ (not shown) determine the steady
state phosphorylation level of CheY.
energy barrier ( EB/greatermuch1). When s= 1, the receptor
is in the ON state with a ﬁnite (but not unique) kinase
activity, whose intensity depends on the methylation m.
Given that the receptor methylation sites are away from
the kinase CheA, we hypothesize that a diﬀerent confor-
mation state ˜ smediates the allosteric control of methy-
lation on the kinase activity. In particular, increasing
minduces a conformational change ˜ s(m) that lowers the
energy barrier EBand thereby increases the phosphory-
lation level of the ON state. The change in the barrier
height is exactly ∆ EB(m) as deﬁned in our nonequilib-
rium allosteric model. It is important to note that while
sacts like a binary switch that can be described by a
two-state model, ˜ smay represent multiple or even a con-
tinuous spectrum of conformations, which lead to diﬀer-
ent kinetic rates or equivalently diﬀerent barrier heights
in the CheY phosphorylation reaction.
The idea that ligand binding and receptor methylation
induce diﬀerent conformational changes in the chemore-
ceptor has been suggested in the experimental litera-
ture [44, 45] and is supported by recent in vivo crosslink-
ing measurements of Tsr receptors [46], which found dif-
fering receptor structure changes in response to ligand
binding and methylation. In particular, the change in
conformation (quantiﬁed by the fraction of crosslinking
products) induced by ligand binding is about twice as
large as the corresponding change between methylation
levelsm= 0 andm= 4.
Another line of evidence comes from the dynami-
cal properties of the cytoplasmic helical domains of
nanodisc-inserted receptors, which have been measured
using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spec-
troscopy [47, 48]. It was found that increasing methy-10
lation reduces the mobility of the helical structure but
preserves the mobility diﬀerence between companion he-
lices and among diﬀerent functional regions. In contrast,
the conformation change induced by ligand binding has
no detectable eﬀect on helical mobility. Since helical mo-
bility is primarily aﬀected by methylation, similar to the
conformation ˜ sin the model, we conjecture that helical
dynamics may play a role in tuning the phosphorylation
energy barrier in the receptor ON state.
These ﬁndings directly support the idea of distinct con-
formational changes ( sand ˜s) used in our model, which
leads to the following emerging picture for chemorecep-
tors operation: ligand binding induces a large conforma-
tional change that switches the receptor from active to in-
active; methylation leads to more subtle conformational
and dynamical changes that modulate the kinetic prop-
erties of the active state. More structural insight into the
conformation states is needed to more concretely disen-
tangle the diﬀering eﬀects of ligand binding and methy-
lation. For example, repeating recent FRET measure-
ments of nanodisc-inserted Tar receptors [49] at diﬀerent
methylation levels would help to clarify this picture.
Generality of the nonequilibrium allosteric model:
application to other two-component systems
Beyond chemotaxis, our model should be broadly ap-
plicable to other two-component signaling systems, which
have been studied extensively in E. coli and other bac-
teria [50]. Here, we illustrate these applications with
theE. coli oxygen sensor protein DosP [30, 51, 52]. In-
creasing oxygen concentration promotes DosP’s ability
to hydrolyze cyclic di-GMP, an important bacterial sec-
ond messenger that triggers downstream responses [53,
54]. Previous work measuring both oxygen binding
and phosphodiesterase activity of DosP as functions of
oxygen concentration reported that the two measure-
ments cannot be consistently explained by an equilibrium
model [30]. Indeed, inconsistency with equilibrium MWC
models can be more systematically demonstrated using
the parametric test introduced in this work (Fig. 6A). A
slightly generalized version of the nonequilibrium model
(see SI Appendix) is able to capture both the binding
and the phosphodiesterase activity curves. As shown in
Fig. 6B, it captures both the sharpness and sensitivity
range diﬀerence between the binding and activity curves.
In contrast, as established by the parametric test, the
MWC model can only capture either but not both re-
sponse curves (see SI Appendix).
Since many of these two-component systems involve
the hydrolysis of energy-rich molecules such as NTP, we
expect simultaneous measurements of ligand binding and
downstream activity dose-response curves to reveal po-
tential inconsistencies with equilibrium models that are
widely adopted. Indeed, inconsistency with equilibrium

models has also been reported for the FixL/FixJ sys-
tem [55]. Large discrepancies between the half-maximal
concentrations for binding and activity have also been ob-
served for the PhoP/PhoQ system [56], suggesting that
it operates out of equilibrium. Overall, the theoretical
framework presented here enables a deeper understand-
ing of the mechanism of two-component systems by ﬁt-
ting simultaneously to measurements of binding and en-
zymatic activity.
More broadly, we expect that the nonequilibrium al-
losteric model developed here may be useful for under-
standing other biological signaling systems such as the
G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways
if the receptor binding and the output activity can be
measured and modeled simultaneously.
Future directions: structure-based nonequilibrium
models for large protein clusters
Besides application to other two-component systems,
another extension of this work is to better incorporate
structural information. In the introduction, we noted
that the MWC model has two major simpliﬁcations: it
is equilibrium and it neglects the rich spatial structure of
large protein complexes. We have addressed the ﬁrst of
these shortcomings by developing a minimal nonequilib-
rium model of allostery that is suﬃcient to explain most
of the existing measurements of chemotactic signaling.
Looking forward, incorporating spatial structure into the
nonequilibrium model will allow us to probe one of the
most important questions in biology: how does structure
determine function? As the structural information for
these complexes becomes available thanks to the recent11
development of high-resolution techniques such as cryo-
electron tomography, the challenge is how this structural
information can be used to understand the functions of
these large complexes. E. coli chemoreceptor clusters
form a beautiful hexagonal lattice structure by tiling
core units made up by two trimers of receptor dimers
bound with a CheA dimer and two CheW [12, 58]. De-
veloping a nonequilibirum model containing these spa-
tial details will be essential for understanding a variety
of recent experimental discoveries including asymmetric
activity switching times [59, 60], emergent asymmetric
coupling in mixed receptor complexes [61], and slow loga-
rithmic decay in activity on long timescales in saturating
ligand [62].

I. TESTING EQUILIBRIUM ALLOSTERIC MODELS
A. MWC model: ﬁtting ligand binding leads to inconsistent kinase activity prediction
In similar spirit to Fig. 1B of the main text, we use the MWC model to ﬁt the binding curves and plot the resulting
kinase activity curves. The results are shown in Fig. S1, which is another demonstration that the MWC model is
inconsistent with the data.
B. Linear dependence between additional degrees of freedom
In the main text [Eq. (7)], we argued that coupling an additional equilibrium degree of freedom (e.g. kinase activity)
to the MWC model produces a response that is linearly related to the MWC activity. Here we show this result is
quite general and holds for any chain of binary variables coupled via the following Hamiltonian,
H= (−µ+E0,1s1)N/summationdisplay
i=1σi+M−1/summationdisplay
i=1(Eisi+Ei,i+1sisi+1) +EMsM. (S1)
As in the main text, σi= 0,1 denotes the receptor occupancy, which depends on ligand concentration [ L] and
dissociation constant Kithrough the chemical potential µ= log([L]/Ki). The variables si= 0,1 are activities for
various components of the system. For example, these might represent diﬀerent conformational changes along the
receptor body or kinase-controlling tip as well as conformational changes of the kinase itself, each coupled in a chain
via equilibrium mechanisms. For each si,Eiis the energy diﬀerence between the active and inactive states, and Ei,i+1
is the coupling energy between neighboring conformations.

show the test for N= 1,3, and 10. Aspartate binding measurements ( /CIRCLE), CheY-P concentration measurements ( /Diamond), and Hill
function ﬁts (solid lines) are transformed using coupling J= 5. The gray shaded area shows the envelope of 95% conﬁdence
regions from Hill function ﬁts for each Nand forJin the range [0 ,10]. Curves are identical to the MWC parametric test for
N= 1 and qualitatively similar for N > 1 (compare to Fig. 1, main text). The transformed data lie well oﬀ the diagonal,
indicating the presence of nonequilibrium driving.
We can relate the average states of neighboring conformational degrees of freedom using conditional probability:
/angbracketleftsj+1/angbracketright=/angbracketleftsj+1|sj= 0/angbracketrightP(sj= 0) +/angbracketleftsj+1|sj= 1/angbracketrightP(sj= 1)
=/angbracketleftsj+1|sj= 0/angbracketright(1−/angbracketleftsj/angbracketright) +/angbracketleftsj+1|sj= 1/angbracketright/angbracketleftsj/angbracketright
=C0+C1/angbracketleftsj/angbracketright,(S2)
whereC0,C1are constants independent of µ. The ﬁnal step relies on the interactions between activities being
equilibrium, so that the conditional expectation /angbracketleftsj+1|sj= 0,1/angbracketrightis independent of µ. For nonequilibrium models,
including the model in the main text, this is not generally true: the conditional expectation can be a function of /angbracketleftsj/angbracketright
and therefore maintain µ-dependence. Given the linear relationship between /angbracketleftsj+1/angbracketrightand/angbracketleftsj/angbracketrightin equilibrium models,
the response curves must be identical after normalization,
/angbracketleftsj+1/angbracketrightmax−/angbracketleftsj+1/angbracketright
/angbracketleftsj+1/angbracketrightmax−/angbracketleftsj+1/angbracketrightmin=/angbracketleftsj+1/angbracketrightmax−/angbracketleftsj+1/angbracketright
/angbracketleftsj+1/angbracketrightmax−/angbracketleftsj+1/angbracketrightmin. (S3)
Since linear proportionality applies to any pair of neighboring activities, it extends to the entire chain. Therefore,
if a system is governed by equilibrium interactions between neighboring conformational states, any measurement of
activity can be captured by an eﬀective MWC model.
C. Ising models fail to explain both ligand binding and kinase response
Ising models are also frequently used to study the behavior of chemoreceptor clusters [2, 3]. In contrast to the MWC
model, which assumes all-or-none activity within a cluster, Ising models allow each receptor to be independently
active or inactive, based on its occupancy. The receptors interact cooperatively via equilibrium mechanisms (perhaps
reﬂective of the lattice spatial structure present in real chemoreceptor complexes). A general Ising Hamiltonian for a
chemoreceptor cluster is given by,
H=N/summationdisplay
i=1(Essi+E0siσi−µσi)−/summationdisplay
i/negationslash=jJijsisj. (S4)
The energy parameters have the same meanings as their MWC counterparts: µ= log([L]/Ki) is the chemical potential
(which depends on ligand concentration [ L] and dissociation constant Ki) andEsis the energy diﬀerence betweenS3
active and inactive states, which is increased by E0when the receptor is occupied. Each receptor sireacts individually
to its occupancy σi, but the receptors interact cooperatively via the coupling Jij>0.
Integrating out the binding degrees of freedom leads to a standard Ising model with an eﬀective ﬁeld,
Heﬀ=−/summationdisplay
i/negationslash=jJijsisj+heﬀ/summationdisplay
isi+Nlog(1 +eµ), h eﬀ=Es+ log1 +eµ
1 +eµ−E0. (S5)
We will consider the 1D (periodic) Jij=J(δi,j−1+δi,j+1)/2 and mean ﬁeld Jij=J/(2N) Ising models. Given
Eq. (S5), the partition function Z=/summationtext
{si}exp(−Heﬀ) is well known for each of these cases, from which the binding
and activity can be readily computed /angbracketlefts/angbracketright=−d logZ/dEsand/angbracketleftσ/angbracketright= d logZ/dµ. We omit the expressions here due
to their complexity.
Given expressions for /angbracketlefts/angbracketrightand/angbracketleftσ/angbracketright, we can derive a parametric relation between the two /angbracketleftσ/angbracketright= ˜σ(/angbracketlefts/angbracketright,smin,smax|J,N),
similar to that obtained in the main text for the MWC model. For the Ising models, /angbracketlefts/angbracketrightis generally not invertible, so
we determine the inferred occupancy ˜ σnumerically for a given receptor-receptor coupling Jand system size N. Fig. S2
shows the parametric test for 1D and mean ﬁeld Ising models applied to the Amin and Hazelbauer measurements [1].
For any choice of system size and receptor coupling, the data lie well oﬀ the diagonal, indicating these equilibrium
models cannot simultaneously explain the binding and activity measurements.
II. THE NONEQUILIBRIUM ALLOSTERIC MODEL CAPTURES BINDING AND ACTIVITY OF
OTHER SIGNALING PROTEINS
A.E. coli oxygen-sensing protein DosP
E. coli DosP is a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, whose enzymatic activity can be signiﬁcantly enhanced by the
binding of oxygen to DosP. Previous experiments measured the ligand binding and phosphodiesterase activity at
diﬀerent oxygen concentrations and demonstrated that the results are incompatible with an equilibrium model [4]. The
same study proposed that the inconsistency with the equilibrium model could be attributed to “memory eﬀects” [4],
which suggests that the system operates out of equilibrium. Here, we show that these measurements can be consistently
explained under the framework of the nonequilibrium allosteric model presented in this work.
First, we carry out a parametric test to examine whether the measurements are consistent with an equilibrium
MWC model with N= 4 (DosP are known to form tetramers [5]). Due to the type of data available, the parametric
test used here is slightly diﬀerent from the one for the chemoreceptor measurements. Speciﬁcally, we infer the mean
ligand occupancy ˜ σfrom the mean activity /angbracketlefts/angbracketrightusing the MWC model:
/angbracketleftσ/angbracketright= ˜σ/parenleftbig
/angbracketlefts/angbracketright,t,[L]1/3,[L]2/3/parenrightbig
, (S6)
where [L]1/3and [L]2/3are the ligand concentration required to achieve 1 /3 or 2/3 of normalized activity and t=smax
smin
is the ratio of maximum and minimum activities, which was measured to be 17 [4]. The inferred occupancy ˜ σcan be
obtained by solving Eqs. (2) and (3) of the main text. As shown by Fig. 6A of the main text, the parametric test
found all data points deviating from the diagonal /angbracketleftσ/angbracketrightexp= ˜σ, revealing that the measurements are inconsistent with
the equilibrium MWC model.
The parametric test implies that the binding and activity data cannot be simultaneously explained under the
framework of the MWC model, no matter how the ﬁtting is done. To demonstrate this, we show representative ﬁts of
the MWC model to the data in Fig. S3. When ﬁt to ligand binding (Fig. S3A, blue line), the model incorrectly predicts
the half-maximal concentration for activity (orange line). Conversely, the model does not capture the half-maximal
concentration for binding when ﬁt to the activity curve (Fig. S3B). When ﬁt to both curves, the model predicts the
correct half-maximal concentrations but completely misses the sharpness of the curves, which describes cooperativity
(Fig. S3C). There exist other ways to ﬁt the data, for example, by assigning diﬀerent weights to activity and binding,
respectively. Nonetheless, none of them will be consistent with the measurements as demonstrated by the parametric
test in Fig. 6A of the main text.
Next, we show that the nonequilibrium allosteric model is capable of simultaneously capturing binding and activity
(Fig. 6B in the main text). Here, we use a slightly generalized version of the model shown in the main text by
allowing hydrolysis for both receptor conformation states s= 0 ands= 1, whose rates are given by k0=kzeEp0and
k1=kzeEp1, respectively. The model is shown in Fig. S4. In the large dissipation limit, the mean activity is
/angbracketlefta/angbracketright=1
