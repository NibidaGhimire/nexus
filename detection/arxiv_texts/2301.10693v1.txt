Abstract
Within the framework of the recently proposed Taylor-Lagrange regularization
procedure, we reanalyze the calculation of radiative corrections in QED at next to
leading order. Starting from a well dened local bare Lagrangian, the use of this reg-
ularization procedure enables us to manipulate fully nite elementary amplitudes in
the ultra-violet as well as infra-red regimes, in physical D= 4 space-time dimensions
and for physical massless photons, as required by gauge invariance. We can thus sepa-
rately calculate the electromagnetic form factors of the electron and the cross-section
for real photon emission, each quantity being nite in these physical conditions. We
then discuss the renormalization group equations within this regularization procedure.
Thanks to the taming of infra-red divergencies, the renormalization group equation
associated to the (physical) eective charge exhibits an ultra-violet stable xed point
at= 0, showing an asymptotic freedom type behavior. We nally consider the
case of two mass scales, one low and one heavy, paying particular attention to the
natural decoupling properties between heavy and light degrees-of-freedom. As a di-
rect consequence, the ne structure constant should be zero in the limit of massless
electrons.
1 Introduction
Following the recent development of a regularization procedure based on the nature
of quantum elds as operator valued distributions ( OPVD ) - the so-called Taylor-
Lagrange regularization scheme ( TLRS ) [1, 2] - we shall consider in this study the case
of quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) in the one-loop, next to leading order ( NLO ),
approximation. This regularization procedure originates from the observation that the
divergences of bare amplitudes can be traced back to the violation of causality due
to the ill-dened product of distributions at the same point [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] (see also
Refs. [9, 10]). Since the Lagrangian we start from is constructed from the product of
elds or derivative of elds at the same point - it is thus called local - the calculation
of any elementary amplitude must be done with great care. The correct mathematical
treatment for such a case is known since a long time [11, 13, 12]. More recently, these
considerations led to the construction of TLRS . According to this procedure, physical

elds are constructed as OPVD , these distributions being applied on test functions
with well dened mathematical properties. Since this scheme is completely nite - in a
sense that will be dened below - it is not plagued by any arbitrariness due to the way
divergences in the ultra-violet ( UV) as well as infra-red ( IR) regimes are cancelled.
We can therefore concentrate on the most important, physical, consequences of the
nite renormalization of the bare amplitudes, as in any interacting many-body system.
The main properties of TLRS can be characterized by the following two essential
features:
•TLRS enables us to give a well dened meaning to the Lagrangian we start
from. This is of course also the case using dimensional regularization ( DR).
Both regularization procedures are thus called a-priori in contrast to a-posteriori
regularization procedures, like for instance using a na ve cut-o in momentum
space. In this latter case, the regularization is done a posteriori at the level of
each elementary amplitude and not at the level of the Lagrangian itself.
•The calculation of any elementary amplitude in TLRS is done in physical condi-
tions, i.e.in four space-time dimensions, with no additional non-physical degrees
of freedom like for instance (innitely massive) Pauli-Villars elds, and for mass-
less photons. TLRS is thus called an intrinsic regularization procedure, in con-
trast toDRfor which elementary amplitudes still diverge in physical conditions.
This last procedure is thus called extrinsic .
The construction of TLRS enables us to treat at the same time UVas well asIR
singular operators [1, 2]. The IRsingularities do occur in particular when massless de-
grees of freedom are involved. A textbook example of such a case is given by one-loop
corrections in QED . UsingDRfor instance, such calculation requires to give, in inter-
mediate steps, a small non-zero mass to the photon. The subsequent massless limit is
then taken at the very end of the calculation. These IRsingularities should be prop-
erly taken care of before any physical consequences can be drawn from the calculation
of a given physical observable. We shall investigate in our study the physical conse-
quences of using TLRS for the calculation of NLO corrections in QED . Although
these corrections are by now well known examples, the use of this regularization pro-
cedure enables a completely new analysis, free from any UVandIRdivergences.
This implies in particular that no intermediate renormalization is necessary. In this
sense,TLRS is at the same time a regularization procedure and a renormalization
scheme, with the same acronym. The only renormalization we should worry about is
the eld strength renormalization for external, on-shell, particles. Thanks to the lack
of anyIRdivergences, this renormalization factor is well dened for massless photons.
The behavior of any elementary amplitude and any physical observable is governed
by two arbitrary scales, as already explained in Ref. [14]:
•theregularization scale denoted by . It is inherent to the regularization proce-
dure which is used to give a mathematical well dened meaning to the local bare
Lagrangian we start from. This scaling variable is dimensionless in TLRS .
•The energy scale Mat which an experiment is performed in order to x the
value of the parameters of the Lagrangian. It is more precisely a set of scales,
like for instance in 4theories. There is however only one scale in the case of
QED . We call this scale the renormalization point since it xes the kinematical
condition where the nite (physical) renormalization of the bare parameters is
performed.1 INTRODUCTION 3
These two arbitrary scales are the ones relevant for the calculation of the running
of the two universal coupling constants - the bare and the physical ones - using the
renormalization group ( RG) equations [14]. The bare coupling constant depends on
the regularization scale only and is denoted by 0(), while the physical one depends
on the renormalization point Monly and is denoted by M(M)1. These two coupling
constants are universal in the sense that they can be identied independently of the
choice of any regularization procedure or any renormalization scheme. Moreover, they
can be dened both in the perturbative as well as non-perturbative regimes. Note
that the calculation of the physical coupling constant M, atM6= 0, is only made
possible when IRdivergences are properly taken care of, as we shall see in Sec. 3.
We would like to emphasize the very dierent nature of these two coupling con-
stants. On the one hand, the bare one - 0() - is dened at the level of the bare
Lagrangian, and knows nothing about the renormalization scheme which will be used,
if any, nor about the physical state which is realized in Nature, like for instance in the
presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. On the other hand, the physical coupling
constantM(M) is a denite property of this physical state, and is independent of
the regularization procedure which has been used. The running of these two coupling
constants is therefore governed by two separate RGequations. The one associated to
the-dependence of 0, calledRGE (), is mass-independent since it is associated to
the local character of the Lagrangian we start from, i.e.to theUVlimit of elementary
amplitudes in momentum space. The RGequation associated to the M-dependence
ofM, calledRGE (M), is mass-dependent since the kinematical condition Mis nite
and not arbitrarily large.
Once elementary amplitudes have been calculated, like for instance the self-energy
of the electron, the polarization operator of the photon and the electromagnetic ver-
tex correction, one should consider physical observables. Apart of course from the
physical mass of the electron which is used to x its bare mass, or the ne structure
constant which is used to x the bare coupling constant and its -dependence, the
rst simple non-trivial observable is the elastic e  escattering. As a direct con-
sequence of the unique properties of TLRS recalled above, we shall see in Sec. 3 - in
the one-photon-exchange approximation - that this scattering amplitude is nite in
physical conditions i.e.with a massless photon. We shall also check that the cross-
section for soft-photon bremstrahlung is nite in these conditions. The calculation
of the electromagnetic form factors of the electron - for an arbitrary precision of the
experimental apparatus in order to separate real photon emission from virtual vertex
corrections - is thus made possible for the rst time. As we shall see in Sec. 4, this
has a non trivial consequence in the high energy limit. In this limit, QED exhibits
anUVstable xed point for the eective charge with = 0, showing an asymptotic
freedom type behavior.
The plan of our article is the following. We calculate in Sec. 2 the elementary
amplitudes in QED atNLO , and check the Ward identities. The electromagnetic
form factors of the electron together with soft-photon bremstrahlung are calculated in
Sec. 3. We discuss in Sec. 4 the use of the RGequations as well as the case of two mass
scales and the limit of massless electrons. Our conclusions are drawn in Sec. 5. We
recall in A the main physical properties of TLRS , while the calculation of all relevant
integrals is detailed in B.
1WhenM(M) is not directly accessible from an experiment at any value of M- as it is the case for
QED - we can consider equivalently an eective charge directly related to a physical observable as we shall
see in Sec. 3.1.2 ELEMENTARY AMPLITUDES 4
2 Elementary amplitudes
For illustration purposes on how to use TLRS in practice, we recall in this section the
calculation of the elementary amplitudes in QED atNLO . For simplicity, we restrict
ourself to the Feynman gauge. The use of dierent gauges is discussed in Ref. [15].
All the necessary integrals are detailed in B.

the integrals in Eq. (5) do not involve any test function anymore since AandBare

of this equation is also zero in the continuum limit since the derivative of the test
functions is zero everywhere except in the asymptotic region where it goes to zero
more rapidly than any power of the momentum as a rapidly decreasing function (see
A). This insures the conservation of the Ward identities at that order. Note that this
is only true in the continuum limit.
3 Physical observables
From the above results, it is easy to anticipate that the use of TLRS enables us to
calculate, for the rst time, physical observables free from any IRdivergences. We
shall concentrate in this rst study on the electromagnetic form factors of the elec-
tron. Within TLRS , these form factors are unambiguous since they are IRnite
and do not depend on any regularization scale. They can be extracted from a com-
bination of e  e ande  e+elastic scattering cross-sections. It is commonly
said thatIRdivergences in the calculation of these cross-sections are cancelled once
soft-photon bremstrahlung - which is not separated out experimentally below a given
energy threshold  Eof the photon - is considered (the well known Bloch-Nordsieck
mechanism [17]). Note that, strictly speaking, these IRdivergences in rst order per-
turbation theory have not disappeared anyhow in this case but they have just been
reinterpreted in terms of IRdivergences when  Etends to 0 in any Gedanken exper-
iment. This is indeed the price to pay, when using DRfor instance, for not having
treated properly these IRdivergences from the start, in physical conditions.
We shall show in Sec. 3.2 how the use of TLRS enables us to calculate the cross-
section for the emission of real massless photons. We rst concentrate on the calcula-
tion of the electromagnetic form factors.

gauge and in the one-photon exchange approximation,

The dots indicate similar contributions with self-energy corrections on any of the external

The form factor F1is normalized to F1(Q2= 0) = 1 by denition of the physical
electric charge eof the electron. The various contributions to MeeatNLO are
indicated on Fig. 1 in the one-photon-exchange approximation. All these contributions
have been calculated in Sec. 2. We thus get, in terms of the bare coupling constant

While this expression is of course not new and refers to the early days of QED [18],
it is calculated here with a massless photon, as demanded by gauge invariance, and is
free from any IRdivergences. As expected F1(Q2) is-independent, as it should.
It is instructive to calculate F1(Q2) in the two limiting kinematical conditions
Q2m2andQ2m2. We get immediately, from the results of Sec. 2,

The value of F1in the large momentum region is of particular interest. While it shows

done, from the start, with a massless photon. This is a direct consequence of using
TLRS which enables us to tame both UVandIRdivergences in physical conditions.
3.2 Soft photon emission

[19]. It is given, in rst order perturbation theory, by

This cross-section does not show any IRdivergences associated to the zero mass
of the photon anymore. One can thus treat separately virtual corrections to the
electromagnetic form factors of the electron from the emission of soft real photons.
This contribution should further be summed up to all orders in order to account
for the emission of an arbitrary number of real photons [19]. This gives the usual

This correction tends to 0 when  Egets very small, leaving only the virtual photon

dently of the ability of the experimental apparatus in disantangling the emission of
soft real photons from elastic e escattering.
3.3 Comparison with dimensional regularization
It is particularly interesting to compare our results with those using DRfor instance,
as far asIRdivergences are concerned. In this latter approach, the only meaningful
contribution to consider in order to get an IRnite physical observable is the sum
of theIRdivergent contributions for both the virtual vertex correction and the con-
tribution from (non-detected) soft-photon emission below a given photon energy  E.
This sum is simply given [20, 21], for the dierential cross-section at large Q2, by:

bution to compare with comes from soft-photon emission, as calculated in Eq. (44).4 THE RENORMALIZATION GROUP EQUATIONS 11
It is rewarding to check that both contributions (44) and (46) are identical for large
values of E=m . This insures that the use of TLRS should be compatible, at NLO at
least, with all QED -related experimental results already analyzed in the framework of
DR. In all these calculations,  Eshould be xed from the exact threshold for (non-
detected) soft-photon emission according to the characteristics of each experimental
apparatus. Contrarily to DR, the use ofTLRS enables us to unambiguously dene the
electromagnetic form factors of the electron independently of any experimental consid-
erations, as expected from general arguments for a well-dened theoretical framework.
As a direct consequence, we can calculate the eective charge of the electron for an
arbitrary value of the energy scale, as we shall see below.
4 The renormalization group equations
4.1 Decoupling equation
As already mentioned in the Introduction, we must consider separately two RGequa-
tions. The rst one, RGE (), is associated to the independence of physical observables
on the dimensionless regularization scale . It concerns the bare parameters and is
mass-independent. The second one, RGE (M), is associated to the independence of
physical observables on the dimensionful renormalization point M. It concerns the
eective charge Mand is mass-dependent. These two RGequations can be obtained
simultaneously from the calculation of the physical coupling constant, or eective
charge, in terms of the bare one, and similarly for the bare mass. By denition of M,
we can write
M(M)F2
1(Q2=M2) =0()Z()2+(;M2) + 21(;M2); (47)
withZgiven by Eq. (7). For completeness, we have indicated in the above equation
the various - andM-dependences. From the results of Sec. 2, we can see that the
-dependence of ( ;M2) and  1(;M2) can be easily separated out, with

Thanks to the Ward identity, the -dependence of 0() is given only by the vac-
uum polarization of the photon, as well known, while the energy scale dependence of4 THE RENORMALIZATION GROUP EQUATIONS 12
the physical coupling constant includes in addition the contribution from the electro-
magnetic vertex. As shown in Ref.[14], this decoupling property persists when these
radiative corrections are summed up to all orders.
Note that the common value of Eq. (50) - which should be independent of both
andM- is just the ne structure constant since it is by construction the value
ofM(M= 0). With the results of Sec. 2, we thus have in both limits Mmand

The decoupling equation (50) is instructive from many points of view.
i)The behavior of 0as a function of should be compared with the behavior of
R() inDRin the minimal subtraction scheme ( MS) as a function of the unit of
mass [22]ofDR. They both give the same mass-independent function with, in
TLRS ,

This behavior should not be identied with any physical pattern. It is just the remnant
of the scaling properties associated to the local character of the Lagrangian we start
from, independently of the relevance of this Lagrangian to describe the physical reality
in a given energy domain.
ii)The behavior of the physical coupling constant Mas a function of Mis given
by itsfunction which is written as
MM@M(M)
@M2
MbM(M): (53)
It involves three dierent contributions easily calculated from Eqs. (48-50). The rst
one is associated to (M2) and is equal, in the limit of large M, toas expected.
The second one is associated to UV
1(M2) and has no equivalence in . The third
one is associated to IR
1(M2), with also no equivalence in . It isIRnite. To get
some insight into these contributions, let us investigate Min two dierent limits:
•In the limit of small energy scale, Mm, or equivalently in the limit of heavy
electron mass, we have
M(Mm) =2

It goes therefore to zero in the limit of innitely large electron mass. This
insures the decoupling of very heavy degrees-of-freedom ( d.o.f. ) from light ones,
as expected from a mass-dependent RGequation.
•In the limit of large momentum scale, Mm, we get
M(Mm) = 22

Remarkably enough, the Mfunction in this limit is negative and mass-
dependent. It is discussed in more details below.4 THE RENORMALIZATION GROUP EQUATIONS 13

Figure 2: The eective charge Mdivided by the ne structure constant - or equivalently
the square of the F1form factor of the electron - as a function of M.
iii)The above decoupling equation between - andM-dependences is also impor-
tant in order to understand how the requirement for a perturbative calculation to
remain valid should be understood. The only relevant (physical) coupling constant is
M, expressed in terms of the physical parameter M. This coupling constant should
be small compared to 1 in order to be able to perform a meaningful perturbative
calculation. This constraint, however, does not imply any constraint on since the
behavior of 0as a function of is decoupled from the behavior of Mas a function
ofM. In other words, can be chosen in principle to be very large, with 0() also
very large, while maintaining a well dened perturbative calculation in terms of M.
From a practical point of view however, should be chosen in order to avoid large
numerical cancellations between 0() and terms explicitly dependent on , as shown
in Eq. (50), order by order in perturbation theory. This argument translates also to
DRwith the identication =m[14]. We emphasize again that this particular
choice of, or equivalently of , should not lead to any physical interpretation.
4.3 Asymptotic behavior

two immediate and far reaching consequences.
•The physical coupling constant does not show any Landau pole. This is at
variance with the bare coupling constant which, as expected from Eq. (52),
exhibits a Landau pole at a critical value of the regularization scale . As
already emphasized in Ref. [14], this Landau pole for 0() should not have any
physical interpretation.
•The physical coupling constant shows an asymptotic freedom type behavior at
very large energies. This is a direct consequence of the mass-dependent con-
tribution to Mat largeM2originating from the taming of IRdivergences in
TLRS for the calculation of the electromagnetic vertex function.4 THE RENORMALIZATION GROUP EQUATIONS 14

The corresponding Mfunction is indicated on Fig. 3. As expected, it exhibits both
anIRstable xed point at M(M= 0) =, and anUV stable xed point at
M(M! 1 ) = 0. Note that for the calculation of the physical coupling
constant, the limit of high energy scale is identical to the limit of small electron mass.
This implies immediately that the physical coupling constant at nite Mshould tend
to zero when the electron mass tends to zero.
4.4 The case of two mass scales
To complete our discussion, let us consider the case of two fermionic degrees of freedom,
one with a low mass m<, the other one with a high mass m>, with the hierarchy
m<m>. We shall concentrate for this discussion on the bare and physical coupling
constants.
The running of the bare coupling constant is entirely given by the vacuum polar-
ization of the photon. It is mass independent, as recalled above. The only change
when considering these two d.o.f. is thus just to multiply the function by two,
without any consideration of threshold eect. The running of the bare coupling con-
stant just counts the number of (charged) d.o.f. present in the Lagrangian we start
from, independently of their mass. Since any physical observable is independent of the
regularization scale , this change of the dependence of the bare coupling constant
has absolutely no inuence on the calculation of physical observables.
We should thus concentrate only on the behavior of the physical coupling constants
as a function of the physical energy scale M, or in other words on the behavior of the
electromagnetic form factors for the light or heavy d.o.f. . We denote by <
Mand>
M
the physical coupling constants of the light and heavy d.o.f. respectively. The only
new contribution to consider as compared to the calculation of the electromagnetic
form factor in Sec. 3, with m=m<orm=m>, corresponds to the contribution of the
vacuum polarization of the photon. We can identify three characteristic kinematical
conditions:
•Mm<m>4 THE RENORMALIZATION GROUP EQUATIONS 15
Since the vacuum polarization of the photon behaves in this limit like M2=m2,
both contributions from light or heavy d.o.f. are negligible and the corresponding
form factors are close to 1. This insures that both coupling constants <
Mand
>
Mare equal to forM= 0, as they should.
•m<m>M

by

This contribution is however subdominant as compared to the IRcontributions
in the large Mkinematical region, as detailed in the preceeding subsection.
•m<Mm>
This case is very similar to the above one, since the contribution from the heavy
d.o.f. behaves in this condition like M2=m2
>which is subdominant.
According to the above discussion, the physical coupling constant <

identical to the physical coupling constant with one mass scale only, as discussed in
the preceding sections. This is in complete agreement with the decoupling theorem
[23]. On the contrary, the physical coupling constant >

4.5 The limit of massless electrons
The discussion of the limit of massless electrons, and the appearance of associated IR
divergences, is usually done in terms of exceptional or non-exceptional momenta [24].
Momenta are said exceptional if any partial sum of external momenta is zero. This
classication, however, does not make any reference to whether the amplitude under
consideration is a physical one or not. It should thus be claried.
Let us rst recall the three dierent objects we have to manipulate in any calcula-
tion of a cross-section. An elementary amplitude is a single diagram which contributes
to this cross-section, as investigated for instance in Sec. 2. Its calculation does not
make any a-priori assumption about the external legs. When these legs correspond
to physical, real, particles, they are on their mass-shell: the corresponding amplitude
is thus called a physical amplitude . Finally, a physical observable corresponds to the
sum of all physical amplitudes contributing to a physical process at a given order of
perturbation theory.
From the above classication, it is clear that the relevant amplitudes to worry
about when calculating a physical process are therefore physical amplitudes and not
elementary ones. This will be our guiding line for discussing the limit of massless
electrons. What happens, however, for elementary amplitudes with o-shell external
legs? This case corresponds to the calculation of diagrams beyond NLO in perturba-
tion theory. The o-shell self-energy ( p) for instance will be attached in this case
to an internal line of a more complex physical amplitude. For this more complex am-
plitude, the external legs of ( p) contribute to internal propagators with appropriate
test functions, according to the use of TLRS . These additional test functions will
prevent any new UVas well asIRsingularities in such a way that only the nal,
on-shell, physical observable is independent of the regularization scale without any
newIRsingularities. The (apparent) singularities appearing for exceptional momenta
will thus be taken care of in TLRS thanks to the presence of the test functions in all
internal propagators.5 CONCLUSIONS 16
According to our discussion in Sec 4, the calculation of the massless limit of the
electron for the dierent functions is immediate. On the one hand, the case of is
trivial but also particularly instructive. Since it is mass-independent, its value for a
massless electron is given by Eq. (52). It is therefore non-zero, with the bare coupling
constant given by (50). This would not be the case, however, if the regularization
scalewould have been dimensionful, as it is the case in the standard formulation
ofDRfor instance. In this scheme indeed, the regularization scale is identied with
the unit of mass [22] ofDR. In absence of any other mass scale at the level of
theQED Lagrangian, the dimensionless renormalized coupling constant in the MS
scheme cannot depend on a single dimensionful variable only. It should therefore be a
constant independent of . This would imply a zero function for QED atNLO , in
contradiction with the mass-independence of the (non-zero) function in DR+MS.
On the other hand, the case of Mis not trivial. Since Mdepends on the dimen-
sionful variable Mthrough the ratio M2=m2, it should be independent of Min the
limit of massless electrons for obvious dimensional arguments. Since this limit is also
equivalent to the large Mlimit, this implies that, by construction, one should have an
UVstable xed point at a given value of the physical coupling constant. This is
precisely what we get from the analysis of the Mfunction in Sec. 4.3, with = 0.
In the limit of massless electrons, the physical coupling constant at nite Mshould
therefore also tend to zero. Note that this is only true in the absence of any other
mass scale in the physical world, i.e.in absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking.
This is not true for instance for quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ).
5 Conclusions
We have reanalyzed in this study rst order radiative corrections to QED in the light
of the recently proposed regularization procedure called TLRS . While these correc-
tions are by now standard textbook exercises, the use of TLRS enables a completely
new insight into our understanding of quantum corrections: it enables a direct calcu-
lation of physical observables in physical conditions starting from the bare Lagrangian
itself, without encountering any UVnorIRdivergences. The only renormalization we
should worry about is the nite, physical, renormalization needed to calculate physi-
cal parameters in terms of bare ones. These features refer to the unique properties of
TLRS : as an a-priori regularization procedure it enables us to give a mathematically
well dened meaning to the local Lagrangian we start from, and as an intrinsic regu-
larization procedure, all intermediate calculations are done in physical conditions, i.e.
in four space-time dimensions with massless photons, as required by gauge invariance.
The analysis of any physical observable should be done in terms of two dierent
sets of parameters: the bare coupling constants and bare masses dened at the level of
the bare Lagrangian, and the physical ones - physical coupling constants and physical
masses - which are measured experimentally and which are used to x the value of the
bare parameters. These two sets of parameters do depend on two dierent running
variables. On the one hand, the bare coupling constant depends on the regularization
scale. This scale is inherent to the local character of the Lagrangian we start from,
which is constructed from the product of elds or derivative of elds at the same space-
time point. It is therefore associated to the scaling invariance of the UVlimit since for
any internal momentum k!1 , we also have  k!1 , for any nite scaling variable
. This regularization scale is therefore dimensionless. This is at variance with the
usual dimensionful unit of mass of DRfor instance. Note that using DRwe can
also identify a corresponding dimensionless variable, as explained in Refs [14, 15]. On
the other hand, the physical coupling constant depends on the kinematical conditions5 CONCLUSIONS 17
chosen to measure it. This is the so-called renormalization point M. By construction,
Mis dimensionful.
The relationship between these two coupling constants, 0andM, is governed
by a decoupling equation, as given by Eq. (50). This equation can also be used to
understand how the decoupling between heavy and light d.o.f. is at work. From its
mass-dependence, the physical coupling constant exhibits explicitly the decoupling
between these d.o.f. , as well known. This behavior however is in complete agreement
with the mass-independence of the -dependence of 0, as shown by this decoupling
equation. This is indeed expected from general physical arguments since is associated
to the scaling properties of elementary amplitudes in the UVregime. These ones are
therefore the same for any d.o.f. of nite mass, light or heavy. It is just associated
to the local character of the Lagrangian we start from. As a direct consequence,
the running of the bare coupling constant as a function of should thus include all
(charged) physical d.o.f. present in the Lagrangian we start from. This should also be
the case for the renormalized coupling constant in DR: the running of the renormalized
coupling constant in DR+MS should include all(charged) physical d.o.f. present
in the Lagrangian of the Standard Model, with no threshold eects depending on the
energy scale under consideration.
Physical observables, when calculated in TLRS , are free from any IRdivergences.
This is the case for the electromagnetic form factors of the electron which can be
calculated directly with massless photons. The F1form factor is then independent of
the characteristics of the detector and of its ability to discriminate a single electron
from an electron-photon state. This unique property of TLRS opens the way for
a direct unambiguous measurement of this form factor and at the same time could
provide a direct non-trivial test of the validity of TLRS . The calculation of this
form factor may also have important consequences for precision experiments involving
QED , like for instance the calculation of the charge radius of the proton from electron
scattering experiments [25]. It also immediately implies the presence of an UVstable
xed point for the physical coupling constant at = 0. Note that the UVbehavior
of the physical coupling constant is entirely dominated by the behavior of the vertex
function in the IRdomain, and is thus UVcomplete.
This nding has remarkable consequences. It implies both the absence of a Landau
pole for the physical coupling constant, as well as an asymptotic freedom type behav-
ior. ThisUVxed point at = 0 is also required by dimensional analysis since the
limit of very high energy scale is identical to the limit of zero electron mass. In this
limit, the physical coupling constant - which is dimensionless - should be independent
of any energy scale, hence its function should be zero. This implies therefore from
Eq. (55) that Mshould be 0 in this limit, in rst order perturbation theory. This
may explain why the ne structure constant is small, since the electron mass is also
small. The physical coupling constant Mat very large energy scale Mthus shows
an asymptotic freedom type behavior, similarly to the eective coupling constant of
QCD extracted for instance from the Bjorken sum rule [26]. This behavior should
completely change our understanding of a possible unication of the physical coupling
constants at very high energy [27].

A Main properties of TLRS
The general mathematical properties of TLRS have been detailed in Refs. [2] and [15].
Several applications have already been considered: application to light-front dynamics
[28], interpretation of the ne-tuning of the Higgs mass in the Standard Model [29],
the recovery of the axial anomaly [30], the fate of the trace anomaly [31] or the study
of conformal eld theories in two-dimensions [32]. For completness, we shall briey
recall in this Appendix the main properties of TLRS .
As already mentioned in the Introduction, this procedure originates from the well
known observation that the divergencies of bare amplitudes can be traced back to the
violation of causality due to ill-dened products of distributions at the same point
[3, 4]. It requires therefore the whole apparatus of the theory of distribution [33] to
correctly dene any local Lagrangian. We consider here for simplicity the case of a
scalar eld.
As detailed in Ref. [2], the physical eld 'is constructed in TLRS as a functional
of the original quantum eld (x), considered as a distribution, according to
'[](x)Z
d4y(y)(x y); (58)
where the reection symmetric test function belongs to the Schwartz space Sof
rapidly decreasing functions [33]. The physical interest to use the test function is
to smear out the original distribution in a space-time domain of typical extension
a. The test function can thus be characterized by a(x) and the physical eld by
'a(x)'[a](x).
For practical calculations, it is convenient to construct the physical elds in mo-
mentum space. If we denote by fthe Fourier transform of the test function a, we
can write'ain terms of creation and annihilation operators, leading to [2]
'a(x)=Zd3p

p=p2+m2. Each propagator being the contraction of two elds is proportional
tof2
. This test function in momentum space is a dimensionless quantity. It should
therefore be expressed in terms of dimensionless arguments. To do that, one shall
introduce an arbitrary scale M0to "measure" all momenta. In practical calculations,
M0can be any of the non-zero physical mass of the theory under consideration2. It
is taken equal to the electron mass min this study. Note that a change in the value
ofM0is just equivalent to a redenition of , without any consequences on physical
observables which should anyhow be independent of andM0.
As shown in Ref. [2], it is appropriate to choose fas a partition of unity. A
simple example of such function, with fconstructed from the sum of two elementary
functions only, is discussed in Ref. [28]. It is equal to 1 almost everywhere and is 0
outside a nite domain of R+4, along with all its derivatives (super-regular function).
The parameter , chosen for convenience between 0 and 1, controls the lower and
upper limits of the support of f. Note that for any partition of unity, the product of
two partitions of unity is also a partition of unity. We shall therefore identify f2
by
fwhen needed. As we shall see in B, we do not need to know the precise form of the
test function as a partition of unity, we just rely on its asymptotic properties. Note
that the construction of the test function as a partition of unity is essential in order
to relate its IRandUVproperties.
2For purely massless theories, M0corresponds for instance to the scale xed to measure any non-zero
momentum.A MAIN PROPERTIES OF TLRS 19
Requiring locality for the bare Lagrangian we start from implies considering the
subsequent limit a!0, dubbed the continuum limit. In this process, it is essential to
preserve the scaling properties
a(x)!a!0(x) ;'a(x)!a!0'(x); (60)
whereis an arbitrary, dimensionless, scaling variable since in the limit a!0, we
also havea=!0, for any nite . This arbitrary scale just governs the \spead"
at which the continuum limit is reached. Any physical observable should of course
be independent of this dimensionless scaling variable, also called regularization scale
in order to stick to the common denomination, although this denomination may be
misleading when using TLRS since this regularization scale is dimensionless in this
case. From the choice of parametrization of f, the continuum limit corresponds to
!1 .
As we shall see in the next Appendix, any amplitude associated to a singular
operatorT(X) is written schematically as
A=Z1
0dX T (X)f(X): (61)
We consider here for simplicity a one-loop amplitude, with a single dimensionless
variableX. It is easy to check that a na ve implementation of the continuum limit
for the test function, with a constant boundary condition like for instance XH=
1=(1 ), will result in a divergent amplitude lim !1 A, as expected from the
calculation of the amplitude in terms of a cut-o in momentum space. However, from
the scaling properties (60), we should get
Alim
!1 A: (62)
To achieve this, we should rather consider a \running" boundary condition on f
dened by
f(XH(X)) = 0; (63)
with
H(X)2Xg(X) + ( 1); (64)
whereis the dimensionless regularization scale in TLRS3with2>1. The function
g(X) is constructed in such a way that the boundary on X, as dened by Eq. (63),
is nite and tends to 1 when!1 . A typical (but not unique) simple form for
g(X) is given by
g(X) =X 1: (65)
The conditions (63) and (64) amount to an innitesimal drop-o of the test function
in theUVregion, with the drop-o rate governed by the regularization scale . It
also preserves the super-regular properties of the test function in the continuum limit,
with the test function and all its derivatives being zero at innity.
Remarkably enough, this boundary condition denes at the same time the UV
andIRboundaries once fis constructed from a partition of unity [28]. The explicit
calculation of standard one-loop integrals using TLRS is thus straightforward, as
recalled in B. It relies on the identication of the test function fwith its Taylor

IRdomains is thus immediate. In the UVdomain the continuum limit (62) is taken
after integration by part. The extension of IRsingular operators [2, 15] involves the

B Relevant integrals
For completness, and as an illustration of the use of TLRS in practical calculations,
we detail in this Appendix all the relevant integrals needed in our study.
B.1 Self-energy of the electron
B.1.1 Calculation of I0
We recall here the various steps of the calculation of this simple integral. More details
can be found in the Appendix of Ref. [30]. We calculate the relevant integrals in
Euclidian space, using Feynman representation. The integral I0is written
I0(p) =i

:
For a non zero electron mass, it is convenient to choose M0m. In the absence of
test functions, this integral is divergent in the UVregime only. We can thus safely
concentrate on the behavior of the test functions for large K2. The use of test functions
whenIRsingular operators are involved is detailed in B.4. In the UVdomain, the
arguments of the two test functions are both equivalent to K2=m2pXwith
p6= 0. We extract here from the running variable Xthe scale  pwhich depends on
the kinematical conditions. This insures that the integrand X=(X+x)2is independent
of any momentum-dependent scale so that the scaling variable is also (implicitely)
independent of any momentum-dependent scale. We thus have, with the identication

a nite additive constant on top of any contribution in Log 2, as indicated in the nal
results for the elementary amplitudes calculated in Sec. (2), with no consequences for
any physical observables. This is reminiscent of the exibility in choosing the unit of
massofDR[22], like for instance using either the MSor theMSschemes.
