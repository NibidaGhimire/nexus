Abstract
PureR2gravity was considered originally to possess only global scale symmet ry. It was
later shown to have the larger restricted Weyl symmetry where it is invariant under the
Weyl transformation gµν→Ω2(x)gµνwhen the conformal factor Ω( x) obeys the harmonic
condition /squareΩ(x) = 0. Restricted Weyl symmetry has an analog in gauge theory. Und er a
gauge transformation Aµ→Aµ+1
e∂µf(x), the gauge-ﬁxing term ( ∂µAµ)2has a residual
gauge symmetry when /squaref= 0. In this paper, we consider scenarios where the symmetry
of pureR2gravity can be enlarged even further. In one scenario, we add a ma ssless scalar
ﬁeld to the pure R2gravity action and show that the action becomes on-shell Weyl inva ri-
ant when the equations of motion are obeyed. We then enlarge the s ymmetry to a BRST
symmetry where no on-shell or restricted Weyl condition is require d. The BRST trans-
formations here are not associated with gauge transformations ( such as diﬀeomorphisms)
but with Weyl (local scale) transformations where the conformal factor consists of a prod-
uct of Grassmann variables. BRST invariance in this context is a gene ralization of Weyl
invariance that is valid in the presence of the Weyl-breaking R2term. In contrast to the
BRST invariance of gauge theories like QCD, it is not preserved after quantization since
renormalization introduces a scale (leading to the well-known Weyl (c onformal) anomaly).
We show that the spontaneous breaking of the BRST symmetry yield s an Einstein action;
this still has a symmetry which is also anomalous. This is in accord with pr evious work
that shows that there is conformal anomaly matching between the unbroken and broken
phases when conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken.

11 Introduction
PureR2gravity (R2alone with no additional Rterm) is unique among quadratic gravity the-
ories as it is unitary and moreover has been shown to be confor mally equivalent to Einstein
gravity with non-zero cosmological constant and massless s calar ﬁeld [1–5] (though in a Pala-
tini formalism one can avoid having a massless scalar [6]). I t has been known for a long time
that it is invariant under the global scale transformation gµν→λ2gµνwhereλis a constant. It
was later discovered to possess a larger symmetry than globa l scale symmetry called restricted
Weyl symmetry [7] where it is invariant under the transforma tiongµν→Ω2(x)gµνwhen the
conformal factor Ω( x) obeys the harmonic condition /squareΩ =gµν∇µ∇νΩ = 0. The conformal
factor Ω(x) is therefore not limited to being a constant. The aforement ioned equivalence be-
tween pure R2gravity and Einstein gravity with cosmological constant wa s then interpreted
in a new light: it occurs when the restricted Weyl symmetry is spontaneously broken [3,5]. In
the broken sector, the Ricci scalar of the background (vacuu m) spacetime has R/negationslash= 0 which
excludes a ﬂat background. This is why the equivalence requi res a non-zero cosmological con-
stant on the the Einstein side. The unbroken sector which has anR= 0 vacuum (background)
has no relation to Einstein gravity. In fact, it has been show n that a linearization of pure R2
gravity about Minkowski spacetime does not yield gravitons but only a propagating scalar [4];
simply put, pure R2gravity does not gravitate about a ﬂat background [4]. Howev er, it was
later shown that if one includes a non-minimally coupled sca lar ﬁeld in the restricted Weyl-
invariant action and the ﬁeld acquires a non-zero VEV, then t he theory can gravitate about
ﬂat spacetime [5,8]. Various aspects of restricted Weyl sym metry, it spontaneous breaking as
well as its role in critical gravity were then explored furth er in [5–7,9–11]
Restricted Weyl symmetry has an analog in gauge theory. The g auge-ﬁxing term ( ∂µAµ)2
is invariant under the gauge transformation Aµ→Aµ+1
e∂µf(x) only when the arbitrary
smooth function f(x) obeys the condition /squaref= 0 where /squarehere represents the ﬂat space
d’Alembertian. Therefore, the gauge-ﬁxing term has a resid ual gauge symmetry when /squaref= 0
is satisﬁed [12]. This is the analog to the restricted Weyl sy mmetry of pure R2gravity when
the conformal factor Ω( x) satisﬁes /squareΩ = 0. As we will see, this analogy is fruitful as it provides
a bridge to the BRST symmetry of pure R2gravity. Recent work on the BRST invariance of
other gravitational theories can be found in [13,14,16].
In this paper, we consider scenarios where the symmetry of pu reR2gravity is enlarged further.
We show that whena massless scalar ﬁeld is added to pure R2gravity, the action becomes Weyl
invariant when the equations of motion are satisﬁed. No sepa rate external condition is required
tobeimposedontheconformalfactor Ω( x)asthisoccursnaturallyviatheequations ofmotion.
One passes from restricted Weyl invariance to on-shell Weyl invariance. One can then enlarge
the symmetry further to include BRST symmetry. In analogy wi th the BRST invariance in
gauge theories in the presence of a gauge-ﬁxing term, we esta blish BRST invariance in the
2presence of the Weyl-breaking pure R2gravity term. The BRST transformations here are
not associated with gauge transformations (such as diﬀeomor phisms) but are a generalization
of Weyl (local scale) transformations where the conformal f actor is composed of Grassmann
variables. Therefore, in contrast to the BRST invariance in gauge theory, it is anomalous since
renormalization introduces a scale (leading to the well-kn own Weyl (conformal) anomaly). We
show that the spontaneous breaking of the BRST symmetry yiel ds an Einstein action with its
own symmetry that is also anomalous. This is in agreement wit h previous work where it was
shown that when conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken there is conformal anomaly
matching in the unbroken and and broken phases [18,19].
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we obtain the on-shell Weyl invariance of pure
R2gravity when a massless scalar ﬁeld is included in the action . In section 3, we obtain the
BRST invariance of pure R2gravity. In section 4, we show that the spontaneous breaking
of the BRST symmetry yields an Einstein action and that there is a quantum anomaly in
both the unbroken and broken sectors. We conclude with secti on 5 where we summarize our
results, provide further physical insights and discuss dir ections for future work. We relegate
to Appendix A some technical details on the symmetry of the Ei nstein action.
2 Pure R2gravity plus a massless scalar: from restricted to
on-shell Weyl invariance
The action of pure R2gravity is given by
S=/integraldisplay√−gd4xαR2(1)
whereRis the Ricci scalar and αa dimensionless constant. This action is restricted Weyl
invariant i.e. it is invariant under the Weyl transformatio ngµν→Ω2(x)gµνif the conformal
factor Ω(x) obeys the condition /squareΩ(x) = 0. This invariance stems from the fact that R→
R/Ω2when/squareΩ(x) = 0. As already mentioned, this implies that pure R2gravity has a greater
symmetry than global scale symmetry (where Ω( x) would have to be a constant).
We now show that pure R2gravity can be Weyl-invariant on-shell when a minimally cou pled
real massless scalar ﬁeld is added to the action. Here, the co ndition/squareΩ(x) = 0 is not imposed
as an external condition but satisﬁed automatically by the e quations of motion. The action of
pureR2gravity with a minimally coupled real massless scalar ﬁeld φis given by
Sa=/integraldisplay√−gd4x/parenleftbig
αR2−1
2gµν∂µφ∂νφ/parenrightbig
(2)
whereφ(x) is a real scalar ﬁeld. Under the Weyl transformation gµν→e−2ǫφgµν, whereǫis
3a real constant, the Ricci scalar transforms as
R→Re2ǫφ−6e3ǫφ/square(e−ǫφ) (3)
and√−g→e−4ǫφ√−gso that action (2) transforms to

.
(4)
The equations of motion yield /square(e−ǫφ) = 0. Therefore, when the equations of motion are
satisﬁed, the above action reduces to
Sc=/integraldisplay√−gd4x/parenleftBig
αR2−1
2gµν∂µψ∂νψ/parenrightBig
(5)
whereψis a real massless scalar ﬁeld (related to the old scalar φviaψ=e−ǫφ/ǫ). Note that
the equation of motion for ψis/squareψ= 0 which is equivalent to /square(e−ǫφ) = 0 and consistent with
what we previously obtained. We therefore recover pure R2gravity with a minimally coupled
real massless scalar ﬁeld ψ. What happened here is that the restricted Weyl condition /squareΩ = 0
with Ω =e−ǫφdid not have to be imposed as a separate condition because it w as satisﬁed
automatically by the equations of motion. In short, pure R2gravity became Weyl invariant
on-shell in the presence of a massless scalar ﬁeld. It passed from restricted Weyl invariance to
on-shell Weyl invariance.
3 BRST invariance of pure R2gravity
Before discussing BRST invariance in the case of pure R2gravity, let us ﬁrst recall how BRST
invariance works in gauge theories in Minkowski spacetime. For illustrative purposes, we will
consider the case of scalar QED. The Abelian version of the Fa ddeev-Popov Lagrangian is then
given by [12]
L=−1
4F2
µν−(Dµφ∗
a)(Dµφa)−m2φ∗
aφa−1
2ξ(∂µAµ)2+¯c/squarec (6)
wherec(x) and ¯c(x) are independent Grassmann-valued ﬁelds, φaare a set of complex scalar
ﬁelds andDµis the usual covariant derivative. The gauge ﬁxing term,1
2ξ(∂µAµ)2breaks the
gauge symmetry since it is not invariant under the transform ationAµ→Aµ+1
e∂µf(x) where
f(x) is an arbitrary function. However, it has a residual symmet ry: it is invariant if f(x)
obeys the condition /squaref= 0. As previously mentioned, this residual symmetry is the a nalog of
restricted Weyl symmetry in pure R2gravity.
4The equation of motion for c(x) is/squarec= 0. Consider the gauge transformation with f(x) =
θc(x) for arbitrary Grassmann number θ. Then, if the equation of motion for cis satisﬁed,
the scalar QED Lagrangian (6) is invariant under the followi ng transformations
Aµ→Aµ+1
eθ∂µc(x)
φa(x)→eiθc(x)φa(x) =φa(x)+iθc(x)φa(x). (7)
In other words, the equation /squaref=θ/squarec= 0 is automatically satisﬁed on-shell and does not
have to be imposed as a separate condition. This is similar to what we saw in the previous
section for pure R2gravity which was invariant under gµν→Ω2gµνwith Ω =e−ǫφwhen the
equations of motion were satisﬁed.
If the equation of motion for cis not used, the only term in the Lagrangian (6) which is not
invariant under the transformation (7) is ( ∂µAµ)2which transforms as
(∂µAµ)2→(∂µAµ)2+2
e(∂µAµ)(θ/squarec) (8)
where we used the fact that θ2= 0 sinceθis Grassmann. Now, if under (7) we also have ¯ c
transforming as
¯c(x)→¯c(x)−θ
eξ(∂µAµ) (9)
then the scalar QED Lagrangian (6) is invariant without having to use the equation of motion
forc. This is BRST invariance. The crucial point is that under the BRST transformations
given by (7) and (9), the Lagrangian is invariant despite the presence of the gauge-ﬁxing term
(∂µAµ)2.
We now turn to pure R2gravity. Consider the action
S=/integraldisplay
d4x√−g(αR2+¯c/squarec) (10)
where again c(x) and ¯c(x) are independent Grassmann-valued ﬁelds. This action is no t Weyl-
invariant i.e. it is not invariant under the transformation gµν→Ω2(x)gµνwhere Ω(x) is an
arbitrary smooth function. Consider now the Weyl transform ation
gµν→e2θc(x)gµν= (1+2θc)gµν (11)
whereθis again an arbitrary Grassmann number. Under this transfor mation we have
√−gαR2→√−g(αR2−12αRθ/squarec) (12)
5where the following transformations were used:√−g→(1+4θc)√−gandR→(1−2θc)R−
6θ/squarec. Again, we used that θ2= 0. Under the transformation (11), /squarectransforms as
/squarec→(1−2θc)/squarec (13)
wheregµν∂µc∂νc= 0 was used (this stems from the fact that gµνis symmetric and cis
Grassmann). The equation of motion for cis/squarec= 0 and we see from (12) that√−gαR2is
Weyl invariant on-shell. However, we can dispense with the o n-shell condition if we also allow
¯cto transform as
¯c→(1−2θc)¯c+12αRθ. (14)
We then obtain
√−g¯c/squarec→√−g(¯c/squarec+12αRθ/squarec). (15)
The last term on the right hand side of (15) above cancels prec isely the last term on the right
hand side of (12). Therefore, the action (10) is invariant un der the combined transformations
of (11) and (14) (which werefer to to as BRSTtransformations ).This is the BRST invariance
of pureR2gravity. Note that BRST invariance does not require any on-shell or r estricted Weyl
condition. It is a generalization of Weyl (conformal) invar iance that is valid in the presence of
the Weyl-breaking R2term.
Let us now take a closer look at what is common and what is diﬀere nt between the BRST
invariance of pure R2gravity and the BRST invariance in the gauge theories of part icle physics
(for concreteness and simplicity, we will consider scalar Q ED again but the main points apply
also to QCD). The BRST invariance in scalar QED can be viewed a s a generalization of gauge
invariance in the presence of the gauge-ﬁxing (and hence gauge-breakin g) term (∂µAµ)2. The
aretwopointsincommonbetweenthescalar QEDand R2cases. First, theRicci scalar Runder
a Weyl transformation and the term ∂µAµundera gauge transformation both pick up an extra
/squareΦ(x) term (where Φ( x) represents either a conformal factor Ω( x) in a Weyl transformation
or a function f(x) in a gauge transformation). Recall that in a BRST transform ation, Φ(x) is
a product of a Grassmann number θwith a Grassmann ﬁeld (the product yields a commuting
(bosonic) quantity). The second point in common is that Rand∂µAµare both squared. The
squaring yields a ( /squareΦ(x))2term which is zerosinceθ2= 0. The squaring still leaves one
extra/squareΦ(x) term and this is cancelled out in both cases via the transfor mation property of a
Grassmann ﬁeld. These two common points render the analogy b etween the two cases quite
strong. However, there is one important diﬀerence. In scalar QED (and in QCD) , the BRST
transformations are associated with gauge transformations . The BRST invariance of pure R2
gravity that we are considering here is not associated with g auge transformations (such as
diﬀeomorphisms) but with Weyl (local scale) transformation s. We will see that this diﬀerence
plays an important role when the theory is quantized.
64 Spontaneous breaking of BRST symmetry
We now show that the BRST-invariant action
S=/integraldisplay
d4x√−g(αR2+¯c/squarec) (16)
is conformally equivalent to an action that involves the Ein stein-Hilbert term; this will involve
the spontaneous breaking of BRST symmetry. The starting poi nt is to introduce a auxiliary
ﬁeldσ(x) to rewrite the above action into the equivalent form
S1=/integraldisplay
d4x√−g(−α(bσ+R)2+αR2+¯c/squarec)
/integraldisplay
d4x√−g(−αb2σ2−2αbRσ+¯c/squarec) (17)
wherebis a realnon-zero constant with dimensions of mass squared and σ(x) is dimensionless.
Action (17) is equivalent to the original action (16) since a dding the squared term in the ﬁrst
line of (17) does not alter anything (classically, the equat ions of motion are unaﬀected and
quantum mechanically, the path integral over σis a Gaussian which yields a constant). The
equivalent action (17) is also BRST invariant; it is invaria nt under the following transforma-
tions:
gµν→(1+2θc)gµν; ¯c→(1−2θc)¯c−12θαbσ;σ→(1−2θc)σ(18)
whereθis again a Grassmann number. Note that the BRST invariance re quires the auxiliary
ﬁeldσto transform besides the ﬁelds gµνand ¯c. We now perform the following conformal
(Weyl) transformation:
gµν→σ−1gµν
¯c→σ¯c (19)
which leads to√−g→σ−2√−gandR→σR−6σ3/2/square(σ−1/2). Under the above conformal
transformation, action (17) becomes
S2=/integraldisplay
d4x√−g(−αb2−2αbR+3αb
σ2∂µσ∂µσ+¯c/squarec−1
σ¯c ∂µc∂µσ).(20)
The above action is no longer invariant under the BRST transf ormations given by (18). The
BRST symmetry has been spontaneously broken. The factor σ−1appearing in the confor-
mal transformation (19) is valid only for non-zero σso that the VEV (vacuum expectation
value) of the ﬁeld σmust be non-zero. The VEV is therefore not invariant under th e BRST
transformation σ→(1−2θc)σleading to the spontaneous breaking of the BRST symmetry.
7We can identify −2αbRas an Einstein-Hilbert term if we equate −2αbwith1
16πGwhereG
is Newton’s constant. The constant term −αb2can then be associated with a cosmological
constant Λ = −b/4. Note that though −2αbis positive, the constant bcan be either positive
or negative (but not zero). This implies that the cosmologic al constant can be either positive
corresponding to a de Sitter (dS) background or negative cor responding to an anti-de Sitter
(AdS) background but it cannot be identically zero. We can th en express (20) as the following
Einstein action,

.(21)
We havelefttheconstant 3 αbin theaction forsimplicity butit isnot anindependentcons tant;
it is equal to−3
32πG. We therefore obtain an Einstein-Hilbert action with non-z ero cosmological
constant, a kinetic term for the scalar σ(which we will express in canonical form later) and
an interaction term. Recall that σis non-zero so that divisions by σpose no issue. It is
well-known that in spontaneously broken theories, the vacu um breaks the symmetry but it is
not actually broken in the Lagrangian but manifested or real ized in a diﬀerent way [12]. It
can be directly veriﬁed (see Appendix A) that the Einstein ac tion (21) is invariant under the
following transformations:
σ→(1−2θc)σ , gµν→gµνand ¯c→¯c−12θαb. (22)
TheBRSTsymmetry of action (17) manifests itself intheEins tein action (21) viaits symmetry
under the above transformations (22). We now show how transf ormation (22) stems from the
BRST transformations (18). In the Einstein action and trans formation (22) label the metric
and the barred Grassmann ﬁeld with a subscript E i.e. gµνEand ¯cE. In action (17) and
transformation (18) we leave gµνand ¯cas is. Then the conformal transformation (19) yields
gµνE=σgµνand ¯cE=σ−1¯c. UndertheBRSTtransformations (18) weobtain gµνE=σgµν→
(1−2θc)σ(1 + 2θc)gµν=σgµν=gµνEand ¯cE=σ−1¯c→(1 + 2θc)σ−1/parenleftbig

=σ−1¯c−12θαb= ¯cE−12θαb. We have therefore obtained the transformations
gµνE→gµνEand ¯cE→¯cE−12θαbwhich correspond to those in (22). Note that we used
σ→(1−2θc)σin (18) to derive this, so the transformation of σis also part of (22).
We can deﬁne a real massless scalar ﬁeld ψ(x) =√
−3αblnσ(x) so that the kinetic term for
σis expressed in canonical form. The Einstein action (21) exp ressed in terms of the ﬁeld ψis

The massless scalar ﬁeld ψcorresponds to the Nambu-Goldstone boson of the broken sect or.
Under transformation (22), the ﬁeld ψtransforms as a shift ψ→ψ−√
−3αb2θc(whereas ¯c→
¯c−12θαbandgµν→gµν). Theabove action (23) is invariant underthose transforma tions (see
8Appendix A). This is in accord with what we expect from sponta neously broken theories: the
original symmetry in the Lagrangian manifests itself in the broken sector as a shift symmetry
of the Goldstone bosons [12].
4.1 Quantum anomaly
We saw that the action (17) is BRST invariant under the follow ing transformations:
gµν→(1 + 2θc)gµν,¯c→(1−2θc)¯c−12θαbσ , σ →(1−2θc)σ. Each transformation
involves a Weyl transformation where the conformal factor i s expressed in terms of of a prod-
uct of two Grassmann variables The BRST symmetry is therefor e a generalization of Weyl
(conformal) symmetry. After quantization, renormalizati on introduces a scale which breaks
the BRST symmetry since it automatically breaks Weyl symmet ry (leading to the well-known
Weyl (conformal) anomaly). So the BRST symmetry of pure R2gravity is anomalous. This is
in contrast to the BRST invariance of gauge theories like QCD which have no anomaly.
After the BRST symmetry is spontaneously broken and we obtai n the Einstein action (21),
we saw that the BRST symmetry manifests itself now in the Eins tein action as a symmetry
under the transformations (22). This symmetry is also anoma lous since the transformation of
the ﬁeldσis a Weyl transformation and renormalization breaks this sy mmetry (leading again
to the Weyl (conformal anomaly). Another way to see this is to note that the only ﬁelds that
transform in (22) are ¯ candσ. The transformation for ¯ cis simply a constant shift so that its
path integral measure D¯cis invariant. However, σundergoes a Weyl transformation and this
introduces a non-trivial Jacobian J (i.e. J/negationslash= 1) to the measure Dσ. Since the measure is not
invariant, this implies there is an anomaly [17]. So the symm etry in the unbroken phase and
its associated symmetry in the broken phase are both anomalo us. Our ﬁnding here is in accord
with previous work that shows that when the Weyl or conformal symmetry is spontaneously
broken there is conformal anomaly matching between the unbr oken and broken phases [18,19].
5 Conclusion
In the last six years or so, we have kept discovering new aspec ts of pureR2gravity. A non-
exhaustive list includes its unitarity among quadratic gra vity theories [4], its conformal equiv-
alence to Einstein gravity with non-zero cosmological cons tant and massless scalar ﬁeld [1–5],
its restricted Weyl symmetry [7,10,11], its spontaneous sy mmetry breaking to Einstein grav-
ity [3,5] and thelack of apropagating graviton whenthetheo ry is linearized about aMinkowski
background [4] (where there is no Einstein equivalence sinc e the cosmological constant is zero).
In this paper, we have gained further insights into this theo ry. We saw that pure R2gravity
has an analog with the gauge-ﬁxing term ( ∂µAµ)2in gauge theory. R2is not invariant under
9the Weyl transformation gµν→Ω2(x)gµνjust like (∂µAµ)2is not invariant under the gauge
transformation Aµ→Aµ+1
e∂µf(x). However, each have a residual symmetry (when /squareΩ = 0
is satisﬁed in the gravity case and /squaref= 0 is satisﬁed in the gauge case). This analogy opened
the door towards enlarging the symmetry of pure R2gravity to include BRST symmetry.
We ﬁrst showed that when a massless scalars ﬁeld was included in the pure R2action, the
condition /squareΩ = 0 could be met automatically when the equations of motion w ere satisﬁed
i.e. we went from restricted Weyl to on-shell Weyl invarianc e. Finally, we obtained the BRST
invariance of pure R2gravity where no restricted Weyl or on-shell condition is re quired. The
BRSTtransformationsinvolve Weyl transformationswheret heconformal factor is composedof
products of Grassmann variables (the conformal factor itse lf is commutative). The important
point is that the BRST invariance exists despite the Weyl-br eakingR2term.
There is one important diﬀerence between the BRST symmetry in gauge theories like QCD
and the BRST symmetry that we have considered here for pure R2gravity. Gauge invari-
ance in particle physics is preserved after quantization. T he BRST invariance of QCD is a
generalization of gauge invariance so that it is also preser ved after quantization; there is no
anomaly. In contrast to gauge symmetry, global scale or Weyl (local scale) symmetry is broken
after quantization since renormalization introduces a sca le. The BRST symmetry of pure R2
gravity is a generalization of Weyl (conformal) symmetry so that it is also broken after quan-
tization leading to the well-known Weyl (conformal) anomal y. After the spontaneous breaking
of the BRST symnmetry, we obtained an Einstein action. We sho wed that this action has
its own symmetry and that it is also anomalous. This is in acco rd with previous work that
shows that when the Weyl (conformal) symmetry is spontaneou sly broken there is conformal
anomaly matching between the unbroken and broken sectors [1 8,19].
The focus of this paper was pure R2gravity because of its many special and attractive fea-
tures that we previously mentioned. All other quadratic gra vity theories (like Weyl-squared,
Riemann-squared, etc.), apart from boundary terms, can be e xpressed as a linear combina-
tion ofR2andRµνRµν. The latter term, the square of the Ricci tensor, appears in q uantum
corrections to General Relativity (GR) and even though it do es not constitute a valid UV
completion of GR due to its non-unitarity (yields a massive s pin two ghost [4,20]), it still
makes a well-known calculable short-range correction to th e Newtonian potential [12,21]. Like
R2, the termRµνRµνis not Weyl-invariant so it would be of interest to see if it ca n be BRST
invariant. It is not in the form of a scalar squared like ( ∂µAµ)2orR2, so one may be inclined
to think that the BRST formalism would not apply here. Howeve r, like pure R2, it was shown
in [7] thatRµνRµνis restricted Weyl invariant (up to a boundary term). This su ggests that
the procedure used to establish the BRST invariance of pure R2gravity might in the end also
work for this quadratic theory. It would therefore be worthw hile and interesting to investigate
this further.

(A.1) is invariant under transformations (A.2).
We saw in section 4 that the Einstein action (A.1) can be expre ssed in terms of a real massless
scalar ﬁeld ψ(x) =√
−3αblnσ(x) as action (23):

−3αb¯c∂µc∂µψ/parenrightBig
(A.4)
whereψwas identiﬁed as the Nambu-Goldstone boson of the broken sec tor. We stated in
section 4 that the action (A.4) was invariant under the follo wing transformations:
ψ→ψ−√
−3αb2θc, ¯c→¯c−12θαbandgµν→gµν. (A.5)
11We now verify this statement. Under (A.5) the last three term s in action (A.4) transform as:
−∂µψ∂µψ→ −∂µψ∂µψ+4θ√
−3αb ∂µψ∂µc
−1√
−3αb¯c∂µc∂µψ→ −1√
−3αb¯c∂µc∂µψ−4θ√
−3αb ∂µψ∂µc
¯c/squarec→¯c/squarec−12θαb/squarec. (A.6)
We see that the extra term +4 θ√
−3αb ∂µψ∂µcin the ﬁrst line above is cancelled by the
extra term on the second line which is equal to its negative. T he only extra term that is
not cancelled is the term −12θαb/squarecappearing in the last line. However,√−g/squarecis a total
derivative which yields a boundary term with no physical con sequence. We have therefore
veriﬁed that the Einstein action (A.4) is indeed invariant u nder the transformations (A.5).
