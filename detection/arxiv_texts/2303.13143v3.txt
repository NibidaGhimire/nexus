Abstract. Given a complex vector subspace VofCn, the dimension of the amoeba of V∩(C∗)ndepends
only on the matroid that Vdeﬁnes on the ground set {1,...,n}. Here we prove that this dimension is given
by the minimum of a certain function over all partitions of th e ground set, as previously conjectured by
Rau. We also prove that this formula can be evaluated in polyn omial time.
1.Introduction
1.1.The goal. LetV⊆Cnbe a complex vector subspace, and set X:=V∩(C∗)n. We assume throughout
thatX/\e}atio\slash=∅, i.e., that Vis not contained in any coordinate hyperplane. We denote by A(X)⊆Rnthe
amoebaofX, deﬁned as the image Log( X) ofXunder the map
Log : (C∗)n→Rn, z= (z1,...,z n)/mapsto→(log(|z1|),...,log(|zn|)).
An open dense subset of A(X) (in the Euclidean topology) is a real manifold, and we write dim RA(X)
for the dimension of this manifold. We will derive a purely combinatorial expression for dim RA(X). This
expression depends only on the matroidMVthatVdeﬁnes on the ground set [ n] :={1,...,n}(see below),
and in fact makes sense for any matroid Mon that ground set, not just those represented by some complex
vector space. Furthermore, we derive an algorithm for computing the said expression that uses a polynomial
number of rank evaluations in M. In particular, if Vis given as the row space of an input matrix with, for
example, entries in the ﬁeld Q(i) of Gaussian rationals, then dim RA(X) can be computed in polynomial
time in the bit-length of the input.
1.2.The matroid of V.ForS⊆[n] we denote by rV(S) the dimension of the image of Vunder the
projection Cn→CS. More explicitly, if d:= dim CVandVis presented as the row space of a d×n-matrix
A, thenrV(S) is the dimension of the span of the columns of Alabelled by S. This is the rank function of
the matroid MVdeﬁned by V. The assumption that X/\e}atio\slash=∅is equivalent to the condition that MVhas no
loops, and to the condition that Ahas no zero column.
1.3.Main results. We will prove the following formula, ﬁrst conjectured by Rau [Rau20 ]. Throughout the
paper, a partition of a ﬁnite set Sis a set of pairwise disjoint, nonempty subsets of S, called the partsof the
partition, whose union is S.
Theorem 1.3.1. We have
(1) dim RA(X) = mink/summationdisplay
i=1(2rV(Pi)−1),
where the minimum is over all partitions {P1,...,P k}of[n].
Example 1. The two obvious upper bounds 2 d−1 (see Lemma 2.1.1) and n(the dimension of the ambient
space) can be recovered by choosing the trivial partition and the p artition into singletons, respectively. More
generally, if the matroid has connected components M1,...,M k, then choosing the partition consisting of
their respective ground sets shows that dim RA(X)≤2d−k.

1The following example, due to Mounir Nisse, shows that the dim RA(X) can drop below min {n,2d−1}
even ifMVis connected.
Example 2. Consider the 4 ×7 matrix
1 0 0 0 ∗ ∗ ∗
0 1 0 0 ∗ ∗ ∗
0 0 1 0 0 0 ∗
0 0 0 1 0 0 ∗
,
where the stars represent any suﬃciently general tuple of comple x numbers. The matroid represented by
such a matrix is connected. However, the partition of columns {1,2,5,6},{3},{4},{7}yields dim RA(X)≤
(2·2−1)+3·(2·1−1) = 6<min{7,2·4−1}.
The next result interprets the expression in the theorem as the ra nk of a matroid. To this end, let Mbe
a loopless matroid on the ﬁnite set E, with rank function r: 2E→N. For subsets S1,...,S k⊆E, put
˜r(S1,...Sk) :=k/summationdisplay
i=1(2r(Si)−1)
and deﬁne the function r′: 2E→Nas
(2) r′(S) := min˜ r(P1,...,P k)
where the minimum is over all partitions {P1,...,P k}ofS.
Theorem 1.3.2. LetMbe a loopless matroid on Ewith rank function r, and let r′be deﬁned as in (2).
Thenr′is the rank function of a matroid M′onE.
Moreover, we will establish the following algorithmic result.
Theorem 1.3.3. The rank function r′ofM′can be evaluated on an input set S⊆Eby a polynomial
number of rank evaluations in M.
Corollary 1.3.4. There exists an algorithm that, on input of a d×n-matrixAwith entries in Q(i)and
with no zero column, computes the amoeba dimension of V∩(C∗)n, whereVis the complex row space of A,
in polynomial time in the bit-length of A.
Proof.This is a direct consequence of Theorems 1.3.1 and 1.3.3, plus the fact that the rank of the submatrix
A[S], obtained from Aby picking the columns labelled by any subset S⊆[n], can be computed in polynomial
time in the bit-length of A. /square
1.4.A matroid conjecture. From [DRY20], we know that, for any irreducible subvariety Xof (C∗)n,
dimRA(X) depends only on the tropicalisation orBergman fan Trop(X) := lim t→0t· A(X) ofX[Ber71].
In our current setting, where Xis the intersection with ( C∗)nof a linear space V⊆Cn, Trop(X) is the
support Σ( MV) of thematroid fan ofMV[Stu02], so it was already known that the amoeba dimension of X
depends only on MV. However, this dependence via [DRY20] is rather implicit and not quite suﬃcient for
algorithmic computation: it states that dim RA(X) = adim( MV) with
(3) adim( M) := min{2dimR(Σ(M)+R)−dimR(R)|R⊆RErational subspace }.
Here arational subspace ofREis a real subspace spanned by its intersection with QE, and Σ( M) +Ris
the Minkowski sum of the r(E)-dimensional polyhedral fan Σ( M) and the linear space R. The formula in
Theorem 1.3.1 was inspired by the following conjecture.
Conjecture 1.4.1. LetMbe a loopless matroid on Eand let Σ( M)⊆REbe the matroid fan of M. Then
the minimum in (3) is attained by some space Rin the braid arrangement, that is, an intersection of a
number of hyperplanes of the form xi=xjwith distinct i,j∈E.
To make the connection with Theorem 1.3.1, consider the subspace Rfor which xi=xjwhenever i
andjlie in the same part of the partition {P1,...,P k}. It is then easy to check that ˜ r(P1,...,P k) =
2dimR(Σ(M)+R)−dimR(R). Hence clearly r′(E)≥adim(M), and Conjecture 1.4.1 is in fact equivalent
to the equality r′(E) = adim( M).
2In particular, if Mis the loopless matroid of a linear space V⊆Cn, then Conjecture 1.4.1 follows from
Theorem 1.3.1 and the formula for the amoeba dimension from [DRY20]. It would be very interesting to
have a direct proof of Conjecture 1.4.1 that works also for non-re presentable matroids.
In any case, an important beneﬁt of Theorem 1.3.1 over the formula dimRA(X) = adim( MV) is that
Theorem 1.3.1 allows for eﬃcient computation of dim RA(X).
1.5.Amoeba dimensions and algebraic matroids. LetKbe an inﬁnite ﬁeld. Any irreducible variety
X⊆(K∗)ndeﬁnes an algebraic matroid MXon [n] by declaring S⊆[n] to be independent if the projection
fromXto (C∗)Sis dominant (this is equivalent to the functions {xi:i∈S}, regarded as polynomial
functions on X, being algebraically independent over K). IfK=RandA⊂(R∗)nis an irreducible semi-
algebraic set, we deﬁne the matroid of Aas the matroid of its Zariski closure A⊂(R∗)n, that is, MA:=MA.
Note that, for example by the decomposition theorem for semi-alge braic sets, A= (R∗)nif and only if A
contains a nonempty Euclidean-open subset. It follows easily that S⊆[n] is independent in MAif and only
if the projection of AtoRScontains a nonempty Euclidean-open subset of RS.
Proposition 1.5.1. LetX⊂(C∗)nbe an irreducible variety. The amoeba A(X)deﬁnes a matroid MA(X),
by declaring S⊆[n]to be independent if the projection of A(X)toRScontains a nonempty Euclidean-open
subset of RS.
Proof.We consider the “squared algebraic amoeba” A′(X)⊂(R>0)ndeﬁned as the image of Xunder
the map |.|2: (C∗)n→(R>0)n, (zi)i/mapsto→(|zi|2)i. Since Xis irreducible and C/Ris a ﬁnite separable
extension, Xis also irreducible with respect to the real Zariski topology of ( C∗)n. Since|.|2is a real regular
map, it follows that A′(X) is an irreducible semi-algebraic set with associated (algebraic) matr oidMA′(X).
Taking square roots and logarithm provides a diﬀeomorphism ( R>0)n→RnsendingA′(X) toA(X), and
this diﬀeomorphism is compatible with projections in the obvious sense . Hence MA(X)as deﬁned in the
statement is equal to MA′(X), which proves the claim. /square
Proposition 1.5.2. IfX=V∩(C∗)nwhereV⊆Cnis a linear space not contained in any coordinate
hyperplane, then the matroid MA(X)is the matroid from Theorem 1.3.2 with the rank function r′constructed
fromM:=MX=MV. In particular, r′deﬁnes an algebraic matroid.
Proof.LetSbe a subset of [ n] and let XSbe the projection of Xinto (C∗)S. ThenSis independent in
MA(X)if and only if dim A(XS) =|S|, which by Theorem 1.3.1 applied to XSis equivalent to the condition
thatr′(S) =|S|. /square
We note that the proof above only uses Theorem 1.3.1 and not Theor em 1.3.2. Hence when M=MVis
a matroid representable over C, Theorem 1.3.1 and the two propositions above implyTheorem 1.3.2.
Giventhat, for Xarisingfromalinearspace, MA(X)hassuch anicedescriptionin termsof MX, onemight
wonder whether the same holds for general irreducible varieties X. In particular, one could ask whether the
amoeba dimension of Xis also determined by MX, for instance via the formula from Theorem 1.3.1.
The answer, however, is no in general. For an extreme counterexa mple, let Xbe ad-dimensional subtorus
of(C∗)nsuchthat MXis the uniformmatroid Ud,nofrankdon[n]—this isachievedbychoosingthe subtorus
Xwhose Lie algebra, i.e., tangent space at (1 ,...,1), is the C-span/a\}bracketle{tR/a\}bracketri}htCof any rational subspace RofQn
that represents the matroid Ud,n. SinceXis a subtorus, its amoeba is a linear space, namely, the real span
/a\}bracketle{tR/a\}bracketri}htR. Hence dim RA(X) isd, which is the minimum among all amoeba dimensions of d-dimensional varieties
(actually, this minimum is attained only for translates of subtori; see [NS22, Theorem 4.6]). On the other
hand, the tangent space VtoXat any point p∈Xequalsp· /a\}bracketle{tR/a\}bracketri}htC(the Hadamard product) and hence
also represents the matroid Ud,n. Therefore dim RA(V∩(C∗)n) = min{n,2d−1}, as is easily seen with the
formula in Theorem 1.3.1.

rem 1.3.2, and in Section 4 we derive the algorithm in Theorem 1.3.3.

2.Proof of Theorem 1.3.1
2.1.Proof of the inequality ≤in(1).As mentioned in §1.4, the inequality ≤in (1) is a consequence of
[DRY20] via dim RA(X) = adim( MV)≤r′(E). Nevertheless, we include a short proof which also serves as
preparation for later arguments.
Recall from [DRY20] that if a closed subvariety Xof (C∗)nis stable under a subtorus Tof (C∗)n, and if
we setY:=X/T⊆(C∗)n/T∼=(C∗)mwithm=n−dimC(T), then we have a surjective map A(X)→ A(Y)
whose ﬁbres are translates of A(T). It then follows that
dimRA(X) = dim RA(Y)+dim RA(T) = dim RA(Y)+dim CT.
Lemma 2.1.1. LetX=V∩(C∗)nwhereVis ad-dimensional complex subspace of Cnnot contained in
any coordinate hyperplane. Then dimRA(X)≤2d−1.
Proof.SinceVis closed under scalar multiplication, Xis stable under the one-dimensional torus T=
{(t,...,t)|t∈C∗}. ThenY:=X/Thas dimension d−1, and hence dim RA(Y)≤dimCY= 2(d−1). It
therefore follows from the above that
dimRA(X) = dim RA(Y)+dim CT≤2(d−1)+1 = 2 d−1,
as desired. /square
Proposition 2.1.2. In Theorem 1.3.1, the inequality ≤holds.
Proof.Let{P1,...,P k}be a partition of [ n]. LetVibe the image of Vunder the projection Cn→CPi, set
di:= dim CVi, and let Xibe the intersection of Viwith (C∗)Pi. SinceVis contained in/producttext
iVi,Xis contained
inX′:=/producttext
iXi, and hence also A(X)⊆ A(X′). Then we ﬁnd
dimRA(X)≤dimRA(X′) =/summationdisplay
idimRA(Xi)≤/summationdisplay
i(2di−1)
where the equality follows from the fact that the amoeba of a produ ct is the product of the amoebas, and
where the last inequality follows from Lemma 2.1.1 applied to each Vi. /square
2.2.Proof of the inequality ≥in(1).To prove ≥in Theorem 1.3.1, we need to construct a partition for
which equality holds. We will do so in an inductive manner.
By deﬁnition, m:= dim RA(X) equals the maximum, over all p∈X, of the real rank of the real linear
mapdpLog :TpX=V→Rn, and this maximum is attained in an open dense subset of X(in the Euclidean
topology).
In what follows, for vectors v,w∈Cn, we write v·wfor their Hadamard product ( v1w1,...,v nwn); and
ifw∈(C∗)n, then we write v/wfor the Hadamard quotient ( v1/w1,...,v n/wn). We also write 1∈Cnfor
the all-one vector (1 ,...,1). Furthermore, if zis a complex number or vector of complex numbers, then we
writeℜ(z) and Im( z) for the real and imaginary parts of parts of z, respectively; we also use this notation
for a subset of vectors in Cn(e.g., a subspace).
Lemma 2.2.1. Forp∈Xandv∈TpX=Vwe have
(dpLog)(v) =ℜ(v/p) = (ℜ(v1/p1),...,ℜ(vn/pn)).
Proof.Deﬁnew:=v/pand decompose w=x+iywithx,y∈Rn. Forǫ∈Rtending to 0 we have
Log(p+ǫv) = Log(p(1+ǫw)) = Log( p)+Log(1+ǫ(x+iy)) = Log( p)+ǫx+O(ǫ2).
The last equality holds because in each component,
log|1+ǫ(xj+iyj)|= log/parenleftig/radicalig
1+2ǫxj+ǫ2(x2
j+y2
j)/parenrightig
=1
2log/parenleftbig
1+2ǫxj+ǫ2(x2

2(2ǫxj+ǫ2(x2
j+y2
j)−1
2/parenleftbig
2ǫxj+ǫ2(x2
j+y2
j)/parenrightbig2+...) =ǫxj+O(ǫ2).
This implies ( dpLog)(v) =x=ℜ(v/p), as desired. /square
4Pickp0∈Xsuch that the linear map A:=dp0Log :V→Rnhas the maximal possible rank m. This
means that Ais a point in the real manifold Hom R(V,Rn)mof real linear maps V→Rnof rank precisely
m. We will use the following description of the tangent space TAHomR(V,Rn)m(see e.g. [Har92, Example
14.16]):
(4) TAHomR(V,Rn)m={B∈HomR(V,Rn)|Bker(A)⊆im(A)}.
Now, for a Euclidean-open neighbourhood Uofp0inX, the map
Φ :U→HomR(V,Rn)m, p/mapsto→dpLog
is a map of smooth manifolds.
Lemma 2.2.2. The derivative dp0Φis the map
Tp0U=V→TAHomR(V,Rn)m, u/mapsto→(v/mapsto→ −ℜ((v·u)/(p0·p0)))
whereA=dp0Log∈HomR(V,Rn).
Proof.Foru∈Vdeﬁnew:=u/p0. Then, for ǫreal and tending to zero, and for v∈V, by Lemma 2.2.1 we
have
Φ(p0+ǫu)(v) = (dp0+ǫuLog)(v) =ℜ(v/(p0+ǫu)) =ℜ(v/(p0(1+ǫw)))
=ℜ((v/p0)·(1−ǫw))+O(ǫ2) =ℜ(v/p0)−ǫℜ((v·w)/p0)+O(ǫ2).
The coeﬃcient of ǫis the expression in the lemma. /square
We simplify the situation as follows: we replace VbyV/p0,XbyX/p0, andp0by1. This only translates
the amoeba of X, and it has no eﬀect on the matroid MV. Consequently, both sides in (1) are unaltered. In
this simpliﬁed setting, Lemma 2.2.1 says that
Av= (d1Log)(v) =ℜ(v).
In particular,
m= dim RA(X) = dim RV−dimRker(A) = dim RV−dimR(V∩(iRn)) (5)
= dim RV−dimR(V∩Rn).
Furthermore, Lemma 2.2.2says that d1Φ is the linear map that sends uto the linear map Bu(v) :=−ℜ(v·u).
We now come to the crucial point in the proof.
Proposition 2.2.3. Under the standing assumption that p=1∈Vis a point where dpLoghas the maximal
rankm= dim RA(X), the real vector space V+Rn⊆Cnis closed under Hadamard multiplication with the
real vector space V∩Rn.
Proof.For each u∈V, the linear map Bu:V→Rnlies in the image of d1Φ and hence in TAHomR(V,Rn)m.
By (4), this means that Bumaps ker( A) into im( A). Since Amaps a vector to its real part, we have
ker(A) =V∩(iRn) and im( A) =ℜ(V). Hence we ﬁnd that Bu(v) =−ℜ(v·u) is inℜ(V) forallv∈V∩(iRn).
Then, for v∈V∩Rn, we have iv∈(V∩(iRn)) and hence the real part of −iv·uis inℜ(V); but this is also
the imaginary part of v·u. Furthermore, since ℜ(V) is also the set of imaginary parts of vectors in V(recall
thatVis a complex vector space, so Vis invariant under the multiplication by i), we ﬁnd that for all u∈V
and allv∈V∩Rn, the imaginary part of v·uequals that of a vector in V, so that v·u∈V+Rn. Thus
(V∩Rn)·V⊆V+Rn,
and since clearly also
(V∩Rn)·Rn⊆Rn⊆V+Rn
the proposition follows. /square
Proposition 2.2.4. Assume that m= dim RA(X)<2d−1. Then there exists a partition {P1,P2}of[n]
into two parts with the following property. Let Vibe the projection of VinCPiand setXi:=Vi∩(C∗)Pi.
Then
dimRA(X) = dim RA(X1)+dim RA(X2).
5Proof.In this case, ker d1Log =V∩(iRn) has real dimension at least 2. Hence so does V∩Rn. Let
v∈V∩Rnbe a vector linearly independent from 1. After adding a suitable multiple of 1, we may assume
that all entries of vare positive, and after scaling we may assume that the maximal entr y ofvequals 1. Let
P1⊆[n] be the positions where vtakes this maximal value 1, and let P2be the complement of P1in [n]. By
construction, P1andP2are both nonempty.
By Proposition 2.2.3, V+Rnis preserved under Hadamard multiplication with v. Iterating this multipli-
cation and taking the limit, we ﬁnd that V+Rnis preserved under setting the coordinates labelled by P2
to zero. Then V+Rnis also preserved under setting the coordinates labelled by P1to zero. Hence we have
V+Rn= (V1+RP1)×(V2+RP2),
whereV1,V2are deﬁned in the proposition.
We assume that for i= 1,2, the all-one vector 1i∈Vi⊆CPihas the same property required of 1, namely,
that dim RA(Xi) equals the rank of the linear map d1iLog :Vi→RPi. (This might not follow from the
corresponding property of 1, but it may be achieved by picking the original p0in a suitable dense subset of
Xand then dividing by that p0.)
Now we have
dimRA(X) = dim RV−dimR(V∩Rn) = dim R(V+Rn)−dimRRn
= dim R(V1+RP1)+dim R(V2+RP2)−|P1|−|P2|
= (dim R(V1+RP1)−dimRRP1)+(dim R(V2+RP2)−dimRRP2)
= (dim RV1−dimR(V1∩RP1))+(dim RV2−dimR(V2∩RP2))
= dim RA(X1)+dim RA(X2),
as desired. Here we use the dimension formula for vector subspace s and (5) three times for V,V1,andV2./square
Proof of Theorem 1.3.1. The inequality ≤was proved in §2.1. For ≥we proceed by induction on n; we
therefore assume that the inequality holds for all strictly smaller va lues ofn.
Now if dim RA(X) = 2d−1, where d= dim CV, then≥is witnessed by the partition of [ n] into a single
partP1. Otherwise, by Proposition 2.2.4, there is a partition {P1,P2}of [n] such that
dimRA(X) = dim RA(X1)+dim RA(X2)
whereXi:=Vi∩(C∗)nandViis the projection of VontoCPi. SinceP1andP2both have cardinalities
strictly smaller than n, the induction hypothesis applies: there exist partitions {Pi1,...,P iki}ofPifor
i= 1,2 with
dimRA(Xi) =ki/summationdisplay
j=1(2rVi(Pij)−1).
Then the partition {P11,...,P 1k1,P21,...,P 2k2}of [n] has the desired property for X. /square
3.The function r′is a rank function
In this section, we analyse the right-hand side of the amoeba dimens ion formula in Theorem 1.3.1, and
show that it is the rank function of another matroid (Theorem 1.3.2) . We ﬁx a ﬁnite set E.
3.1.Preliminaries on multisets of subsets. We study ﬁnite multisets of subsets of Eand denote these
by boldface letters such as S. IfS,Tare such multisets, then so is their multiset union S∪T. We write # S
for the number of elements of Scounting multiplicities.
Denote by /{ollowsequalthe transitive relation on the set of ﬁnite multisets of subsets of Esuch that S/{ollowsequalTif and
only if there is a sequence of multisets
S=S1,...,Sℓ=T
sothat each Si+1arisesfrom Sibyreplacingsome intersecting pair S,S′∈Si, i.e., a pairsuchthat S∩S′/\e}atio\slash=∅,
with the pair S∩S′,S∪S′. Note that we have ∅ /\e}atio\slash∈S⇒ ∅ /\e}atio\slash∈T. Furthermore, if we deﬁne n(S) :=/summationtext
S∈S|S|2,
then we have n(Si+1)≥n(Si) with equality if and only if Si+1=Si. Hence
S/{ollowsequalT=⇒n(S)≤n(T),
6with equality if and only if S=T. It follows that /{ollowsequalis a partial order on ﬁnite multisets of subsets of E.
Also, since a multiset Swithkelements (counting multiplicities) has n(S)≤k|E|2, there are no inﬁnite
decreasing sequences in the partial order /{ollowsequal. Hence, for any multiset S, there exists T/precedesequalSwithTminimal
with respect to /precedesequal, that is, T/{ollowsequalUimpliesT=U. Moreover Tis minimal with respect to /precedesequalif and only if it
iscross-free : there are no sets T,T′∈Tthatcrossin the sense that T∩T′,T\T′,T′\Tare all nonempty.
For any multiset Sof subsets of E, theﬁnest common coarsening is the set of subsets of Edeﬁned by
fcc(S) :=/braceleftig
T⊆/uniondisplay
S|Tis an inclusion-wise minimal nonempty set so that ∀S∈S:S∩T=∅orS⊆T/bracerightig
.
Intuitively, every T∈fcc(S) is obtained from starting with some nonempty S∈S, and keep merging with
any other S′∈Swith nonempty intersection until it stabilises. In particular, fcc( S) is a partition of/uniontextS,
and the deﬁnition of the partial order /{ollowsequalimplies that
S/{ollowsequalT=⇒fcc(S) = fcc(T).
Note that if Tis cross-free, then fcc( T)⊆T.
For a partition PofS⊆Eand a partition P′ofS′⊆E, we deﬁne
P∨P′:= fcc(P∪P′) andP∧P′:={P∩P′:P∈P,P′∈P′}\{∅}.
ThenP∨P′is a partition of S∪S′, andP∧P′is a partition of S∩S′.
3.2.A new matroid from M.Now let Mbe a loopless matroid on Ewith rank function r: 2E→N.
Recall from §1.3 that, for a multiset Sconsisting of nonempty subsets S1,...,S kofE, we have deﬁned
˜r(S) = ˜r(S1,...Sk) :=k/summationdisplay
i=12r(Si)−1.
Furthermore, we have deﬁned r′: 2E→Nas
r′(S) := min {˜r(P)|Pis a partition of S}.
A partition PofSwithr′(S) = ˜r(P) will be called an optimal partition of Sor simply optimal for S.
The submodularity of rimplies that, if S=S1,...,Sℓ=Tis a sequence witnessing S/{ollowsequalTandSi+1
arises from Siby replacing the pair S,S′byS∪S′,S∩S′, then
˜r(Si)−˜r(Si+1) = (2r(S)−1)+(2r(S′)−1)−(2r(S∪S′)−1)−(2r(S∩S′)−1)≥0
for each i, so that
S/{ollowsequalT=⇒˜r(S)≥˜r(T).
Lemma 3.2.1. LetP,P′be partitions of S,S′⊆E, respectively. There is a partition QofS∩S′so that
˜r(P)+ ˜r(P′)≥˜r(P∨P′)+ ˜r(Q),
Qis a coarsening of P∧P′, and#P+#P′= #P∨P′+#Q.
In the proof, we use the notation c(S)efor the number of sets Sin the multiset Sthat contain a given

S/{ollowsequalT=⇒c(S)e=c(T)e.
Proof.SetS:=P∪P′and letTbe a cross-free multiset so that S/{ollowsequalT. We have
P∨P′= fcc(P∪P′) = fcc(S) = fcc(T),
SinceTis cross-free, we have fcc( T)⊆T. LetQbe the multiset that arises from Tby taking away fcc( T).
Then, for each e∈E,

SoQis a partition of S∩S′, and since each element of Tarises by taking unions and intersections starting

3.3.Proof of Theorem 1.3.2.
Proof.We show that r′satisﬁes the matroid rank axioms:
(1)r′(S)≥0 for all S⊆E: LetPbe an optimal partition of S. AsMis loopless, we have r(P)≥1
whenever P/\e}atio\slash=∅, and so
r′(S) = ˜r(P) =/summationdisplay
P∈P(2r(P)−1)≥0,
as required.
(2)r′(S)≤ |S|for allS⊆E: this follows by taking the partition Pto be the partition into singletons.
(3)r′(S′)≤r′(S) whenever S′⊆S⊆E: LetPbe an optimal partition of S. Then
r′(S′)≤˜r(P∧{S′})≤˜r(P) =r′(S)
as required.
(4)r′(S) +r′(S′)≥r′(S∪S′) +r′(S∩S′) for all S,S′⊆E: LetP,P′be optimal partitions of S,S′,
respectively. By Lemma 3.2.1, there is a partition QofS∩S′so that
r′(S)+r′(S′) = ˜r(P)+ ˜r(P′)≥˜r(P∨P′)+ ˜r(Q)≥r′(S∪S′)+r′(S∩S′),
as required. /square
3.4.Structure of M′.The matroid on Ewith rank function r′is denoted M′. We make a few observations
on the structure of M′in relation to M.
IfMandNare matroids on a ground set E, thenMis aquotient ofNif each ﬂat of Mis also a ﬂat of
N.
Lemma 3.4.1. The matroid Mis a quotient of M′.
Proof.LetFbe a ﬂat of M. Assume that Fis not a ﬂat in M′. Then there exists e∈E\Fsuch that
r′(F+e) =r′(F). Let{P1,...,P k}be an optimal partition of F+e. We may assume e∈P1. Now
˜r(P1,...,P k) =r′(F) implies that r(P1) =r(P1−e). In particular, eis contained in any ﬂat containing
P1−e⊂F, a contradiction to Fbeing a ﬂat in M. Hence the claim follows. /square
Thetruncation of a matroid Mof rankd >0 is the matroid Non the same ground set with rank function

N(S) = ˜rN(P)≥2rN(P)−1 = 2d−3.
Thenr′

Letc∈N. A matroid Mon the ground set Eand with rank function risc-connected if there is no subset
S⊆Eso that|S| ≥c,|E\S| ≥c, and
r(S)+r(E\S)−r(E)< c.
The next example illustrates that even if we assume that Mhas a high connectivity (and representable over
C), the rank of M′may still be strictly less than the trivial bound min {|E|,2r(M)−1}from Example 1.
Indeed, a high connectivity will not even force the existence of an o ptimal partition into few parts.
8Example 3. Letc,kbe positive integers so that k >2c+ 1. Consider the matroid Mthat arises from
the disjoint union of matroids M1,...,M kby truncating ctimes, where each Mihas ground set Eiand is
isomorphic to the uniform matroid Uc,2c. LetEbe the ground set of M, and let P0:={E1,...,E k}. Then
the ground set of Mhasn:=|E|= 2ckelements, the rank of Misd:=ck−c, and the rank in MofS⊆E
equals
r(S) = min/braceleftigg

i=1min{c,|S∩Ei|}/bracerightigg
.
We ﬁrst verify that Misc-connected. Let S⊆Ewith|S| ≥cand|E\S| ≥c. Ifr(E\S) =d, then
r(S)+r(E\S)−r(E) =r(S)≥min{c,|S|}=c. Ifr(S) =d, then similarly r(S)+r(E\S)−r(E)≥c. In
the remaining case r(S)< dandr(E\S)< d, hence
r(S)+r(E\S)−r(E) =k/summationdisplay
i=1(min{c,|S∩Ei|}+min{c,|S\Ei|})−(ck−c)≥ck−(ck−c) =c
as required.
Next, we show that the rank of M′is strictly less than min {n,2d−1}, and that any optimal partition will
have at least kparts. Consider an optimal partition PofEso that # Pis as small as possible. Let i∈[k].
By Lemma 3.2.1, there exists a partition QofEiso that ˜r(P)+˜r({Ei})≥˜r(P∨{Ei})+˜r(Q).Since{Ei}is
an optimal partition for Ei, if follows that P∨{Ei}is optimal partition for E. By our choice of P, we have
#P≤#(P∨{Ei}), so that Ei⊆Pfor some P∈P. It follows that Pis a coarsening of P0. Ifr(P)< dfor
eachP∈P, then ˜r(P) = 2ck−#P, so that P=P0by the optimality of P. If on the other hand r(P) =d
for some part P∈P, then ˜r(P)≥2d−1 = 2ck−2c−1>2ck−k= ˜r(P0) ask >2c+1, contradicting that
Pis optimal. We conclude that P=P0, and in particular, that there are no optimal partitions with less
than #P0=kparts. Then the rank of M′is ˜r(P0) = 2ck−k <min{2ck,2(ck−c)−1}= min{n,2d−1},
as required.

4.An algorithm for evaluating r′
We retain the notation of the previous section and continue to explo re the functions r′and ˜rderived from
a ﬁxed rank function rof a loopless matroid Mon a ﬁnite set E, aiming for an algorithm to evaluate r′(S)
given any S⊆E.
4.1.Optimal partitions form a lattice.
Lemma 4.1.1. LetP,P′be optimal partitions of S,S′⊆E, respectively. If
r′(S)+r′(S′) =r′(S∪S′)+r′(S∩S′),
thenP∨P′is optimal for S∪S′andP∧P′is optimal for S∩S′.
Proof.By Lemma 3.2.1, there exists a partition QofS∩S′that is a coarsening of the partition P∧P′so
that
r′(S)+r′(S′) = ˜r(P)+ ˜r(P′)≥˜r(P∨P′)+ ˜r(Q)≥r′(S∪S′)+r′(S∩S′).
By our assumption that r′(S) +r′(S′) =r′(S∪S′) +r′(S∩S′), we have r′(S∪S′) = ˜r(P∨P′) and
r′(S∩S′) = ˜r(Q). SoP∨P′is optimal for S∩S′, andQis optimal for S∩S′as well as a coarsening of
P∧P′.
LetQ∗be an optimal partition of S∩S′, as well as a coarsening of P∧P′, with #Q∗as large as possible.
By Lemma 3.2.1 there is a coarsening Q′ofP∧Q∗with
r′(S)+r′(S∩S′) = ˜r(P)+ ˜r(Q∗)≥˜r(P∨Q∗)+ ˜r(Q′)≥r′(S)+r′(S∩S′),
so that we again have equality throughout, and with # P+ #Q∗= #(P∨Q∗) + #Q′. ThenQ′is also
a coarsening of P∧P′andr′(S∩S′) = ˜r(Q′), so that # Q′≤#Q∗by our choice of Q∗. It follows that
#P≥#(P∨Q∗) and hence each element of Q∗is a subset of an element of P. Similarly, each element of
Q∗is the subset of an element of P′. ThenQ∗=P∧P′, and so P∧P′is optimal for S∩S′. /square
94.2.Coarsest optimal partition and submodular minimisation. It follows from Lemma 4.1.1 that
for any set S⊆Ethere is a unique coarsest optimal partition
P∗:=/logicalordisplay
Poptimal for SP
so that each optimal partition for SreﬁnesP∗. Similarly, there is a unique ﬁnest optimal partition
P∗:=/logicalanddisplay
Poptimal for SP
which reﬁnes each optimal partition for S.
We will describe an algorithm to calculate the coarsest optimal partit ion for any given S⊆E. The
coarsest optimal partition PforSequals
(6) Q:={Q⊆S|Qis inclusion-wise maximal so that r′(Q) = 2r(Q)−1}
To see this, note that because Pis optimal, each part P∈Phasr′(P) = 2r(P)−1 and hence is contained
in one of the elements Q∈Q. The inclusion P⊆Qcannot be strict, for then P∨{Q}would be a coarser
optimal partition for SthanPby Lemma 4.1.1. Hence P=Q.
Because (6) refers to the value r′(Q), which we do not yet know how to compute, (6) is not directly usefu l
for ﬁnding the coarsest partition for a general subset S⊆E. But if we assume that Sis independent in M′,
i.e., that |S|=r′(S), then each Q⊆Shasr′(Q) =|Q|, so that we can identify the part Qof the coarsest
optimal partition containing a given e∈Sas the largest Q⊆Ssuch that e∈Qand 2r(Q)−1 =|Q|.
Finding this Qcan be cast as a submodular function minimisation problem; in the follow ing lemma to this
eﬀect,B+eplays the role of S.
Lemma 4.2.1. LetB⊆Eande∈E\Bbe such that r′(B+e) =|B+e|. Then the function f: 2B→Q
determined by
(7) f(I) := 2r(I+e)−1−|I+e|−|I|
2|B|
is submodular, and Jis a largest subset of Bso that2r(J+e)−1 =|J+e|if and only f(J) = min If(I).
Proof.The submodularity of ffollows from the submodularity of the rank function r. For each I⊆Bwe
have|I+e|=r′(I+e)≤˜r({I+e}) = 2r(I+e)−1; hence,
f(I)≤0⇔2r(I+e)−1≤ |I+e|+|I|
2|B|⇔2r(I+e)−1 =|I+e| ⇔f(I) =−|I|
2|B|.
Here, the second ⇔uses the fact that 0 ≤|I|
2|B|≤1
2, while every other term is an integer. Since f(∅) = 0,
we have 0 ≥minIf(I). The lemma follows. /square
That a submodular function fobtained from a matroid rank function as in (7) can be minimised in poly-
nomial time was ﬁrst established by Cunningham in [Cun84]. The weakly polynomial time algorithm of Lee,
Sidford, and Wong [LSW15] for submodular set function minimisation t akesO(k2log(k)·γ+k3logO(1)(k))
time to minimise f, wherek:=|B|andγis the time needed to evaluate f.
4.3.Proof of Theorem 1.3.3. To make sure that an optimal partition for Sis the coarsest, it will suﬃce
to consider the intersection of that partition with a spanning subse tS′ofS.
Lemma 4.3.1. Suppose that S′⊆S⊆E, and let P′,Pbe partitions of S′,Sresp. so that P′=P∧{S′}.
Then:
(1) ˜r(P) =r′(S) =r′(S′)if and only if r(P∩S′) =r(P)for allP∈PandP′is optimal for S′, and
(2)if˜r(P) =r′(S) =r′(S′), thenPis the coarsest optimal partition of Sif and only if P′is the coarsest
optimal partition of S′.
Proof.We have
˜r(P′) =/summationdisplay
P∈P,P∩S′/negationslash=∅(2r(P∩S′)−1)≤/summationdisplay
P∈P(2r(P)−1) = ˜r(P),
10so that ˜r(P′) = ˜r(P) if and only if r(P∩S′) =r(P) for allP∈P. Sincer(P)>0 for all P∈P, it follows
that if ˜r(P′) = ˜r(P), then # P′= #P.
(1) If ˜r(P) =r′(S) =r′(S′), then since r′(S′)≤˜r(P′)≤˜r(P) we have ˜ r(P′) = ˜r(P) andr′(S′) = ˜r(P′).
Conversely if ˜ r(P′) = ˜r(P) andr′(S′) = ˜r(P′), thenr′(S)≥r′(S) = ˜r(P′) = ˜r(P)≥r′(S), and then
we have equality throughout.
(2) Now assume that ˜ r(P) =r′(S) =r′(S′), so that P′is optimal for S′and ˜r(P′) = ˜r(P). Suppose
thatPis not the coarsest optimal partition of Sand that say, Qis a coarser optimal partition of S.
ThenQ′:=Q∧{S′}is an optimal partition for S′by (1) and # Q′= #Q<#P= #P′, so that
P′is not the coarsest optimal partition of S′. Conversely, suppose that P′is not coarsest and that
say,Q′is an optimal partition of S′coarser than P′. ThenQ:=P∨Q′is an optimal partition of
Sby Lemma 4.1.1. It follows that Q∧{S′}=Q′, and hence # Q= #Q′<#P′= #P. ThenPis
not the coarsest optimal partition of S.
This proves the two parts of the lemma. /square

Theorem 4.3.2. Given a set S⊆E, Algorithm 1 determines the coarsest optimal partition PforSand a
subsetB⊆Ssuch that
|B|=r′(B) =r′(S) = ˜r(P).
Moreover, the algorithm runs in polynomial time, taking O(nk+k3log(k))rank evaluations in M, where
n:=|S|,k:=r′(S).
Proof.We ﬁrst argue that the output of the algorithm is correct, using ind uction on |S|. The case that
S=∅is trivial, so assume that S/\e}atio\slash=∅, and let e∈S. By induction, the algorithm correctly computes the
coarsest optimal partition P′forS′:=S−eand a subset B′⊆S′such that |B′|=r′(B) =r′(S′) = ˜r(P′)
initially.
Ifr(P′+e) =r(P′) for some P′∈P′, then consider the output P:=P′∨{P′+e}andB:=B′in this
case. By construction of P, we have P′=P∨{S′}, andr(P−e) =r(P) for allP∈P. By application of
Lemma 4.3.1(1) to S′,S,P′,P, we ﬁnd that ˜ r(P) =r′(S) =r′(S′). SinceP′is the coarsest optimal partition
ofS′, part (2) of the same lemma yields that Pis the coarsest optimal partition of S. Since the rank and
cardinality of B=B′equalr′(S′) =r′(S), the output is correct in this case.
If there is no P′∈P′so thatr(P′+e) =r(P′), then the algorithm proceeds to ﬁnd some largest set
J⊆B′such that 2 r(J+e)−1 =|J+e|. We will show that the output P:=P′∨{J+e},B:=B′+eis
again correct. We ﬁrst argue that r(S) =r′(S′) +1. Consider the coarsest optimal partition QofS, and
putQ′:=Q∧ {S′}. Ifr′(S) =r′(S′), then an application of Lemma 4.3.1(2) to S′,S,Q′,Qshows that
Q′=P′, and using part (1) we ﬁnd that for the element Q∈Qso thate∈Q, we have r(Q−e) =r(Q).
ThenP′:=Q−e∈Q′=P′hasr(P′+e) =r(P′), a contradiction. So r(S) =r′(S′)+1. By submodularity
11ofr′, we have r′(S′) +r′(B)≥r′(S) +r′(B′).It follows that r′(B) =r(B′) + 1 =|B′|+ 1 =|B|. Since
J+e⊆B, we have
r′(J+e) =|J+e|= 2r(J+e)−1 = ˜r({J+e})
so that{J+e}is an optimal partition for J+e. By Lemma 4.1.1, and noting that
r′(S′)+r′(J+e) =r(S)+r′(J),
if follows that P=P′∨ {J+e}is optimal for S. LetQ:=P∧ {B}. ThenQis an optimal partition of
Bby Lemma 4.3.1(1) applied to B,S,Q,P. If there is a coarser optimal partition Q′ofB, then there is a
partQ′∈Q′that is not contained in any part of Q, hence is not contained in any part of P. Ife/\e}atio\slash∈Q′,
thenP′∨ {Q′}is a coarser optimal partition of S′thanP′, a contradiction. So e∈Q′, henceJ+eis
properly contained in Q′, and|Q′|= ˜r({Q′}) = 2r(Q′)−1. But then J′:=Q′−econtradicts the choice of
J. Therefore Qis the coarsest optimal partition of B. By Lemma 4.3.1(2) applied to B,S,Q,P, it follows
thatPis the coarsest optimal partition of S.
It remains to show that the algorithm takes polynomial time, and O(nk+k3log(k)) rank evaluations in
M. We only count the number of rank evaluations in M, the remaining work clearly being less signiﬁcant
in comparison. Not counting the rank evaluations used to recursive ly compute B′,P′forS′:=S−e, the
algorithm performs at most # P′≤r′(S′)≤r′(S) =krank evaluations to test if r(P′+e) =r(P′) for a
P′∈P′. If so, then |B|=|B′|and no further rank evaluations are performed. If not, then |B|=|B′|+1
and for the calculation of Jone may use submodular function minimisation as in Lemma 4.2.1, taking
O(k2log(k)) evaluations of the submodular function f, each evaluation of ftaking one rank evaluation in
M. The depth of the recursion equals |S|, with at most krank evaluations at each depth for testing and
O(k2log(k)) for computing Jat each depth where the cardinality of the basis Bincreases. Thus the entire
recursive algorithm will see at most |S|·k+|B|·O(k2log(k)) =O(nk+k3log(k)) rank evaluations in M,
as required. /square
Remark. It was pointed out to us by an anonymous referee that the matroid M′arises as a sub-matroid
of theDilworth truncation Nof the direct sum of two copies M1andM2ofM. That is,
