WEIGHTED MAXIMAL INEQUALITIES ON HYPERBOLIC SPACES
JORGE ANTEZANA AND SHELDY OMBROSI
Abstract. In this work we develop a weight theory in the setting of hyperbolic
spaces. Our starting point is a variant of the well-known endpoint Fefferman-Stein
inequality for the centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. This inequality gen-
eralizes, in the hyperbolic setting, the weak (1,1)estimates obtained by Strömberg
in [17] who answered a question posed by Stein and Wainger in [16]. Our approach
is based on a combination of geometrical arguments and the techniques used in
the discrete setting of regular trees by Naor and Tao in [11]. This variant of the
Fefferman-Stein inequality paves the road to weighted estimates for the maximal
function for p > 1. On the one hand, we show that the classical Apconditions are
not the right ones in this setting. On the other hand, we provide sharp sufficient
conditions for weighted weak and strong type (p, p)boundedness of the centered
maximal function, when p > 1. The sharpness is in the sense that, given p > 1,
we can construct a weight satisfying our sufficient condition for that p, and so it
satisfies the weak type (p, p)inequality, but the strong type (p, p)inequality fails. In
particular, the weak type (q, q)fails as well for every q < p.
1.Introduction
LetHndenote the n-dimensional hyperbolic space, i.e. the unique (up to isometries)
n-dimensional, complete, and simply connected Riemannian manifold with constant
sectional curvature −1. Let µndenote the corresponding volume measure. If BH(x, r)

In the seminal work [16], Stein and Wainger proposed the study of the end-point esti-
mates for the centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal function when the curvature of the
underline space could be non-negative. In this more general scenario, the euclidean
spaces Rnand the aforementioned hyperbolic spaces Hnrepresent two extreme cases.
In [17], Strömberg proved the (unweighted) weak type (1,1)boundedness of Min
symmetric spaces of noncompact type, suggesting that the behavior of the maximal

operator is the same in both spaces, RnandHn. However, this is not the case in
general, and it will be reveled by analyzing weighted estimates. More precisely, to
complete the answer to Stein-Wainger’s question we study an end-point two-weight
Fefferman-Stein inequality for Min the hyperbolic setting.
1.1.Fefferman Stein type inequality. In the Euclidean setting, the classical Feffer-
man Stein inequality [4] is
w({x∈Rn:Mf(x)> λ})≲1
λZ
Rn|f(x)|Mw(x)dx,
where wis non-negative measurable function (a weight) defined in Rn, and w(E) =R
Ew(x)dx. This is a cornerstone in the theory of weights, and a powerful tool to
consider vector valued extension of the maximal function M. This result follows from
a classical covering lemma, which is not available in the hyperbolic setting. Indeed, in
this setting
(1.1) µn
BH(x, r)
= Ω nZr
0(sinh t)n−1dt∼nrn
1 +rne(n−1)r,
where Ωnis the euclidean (n−1)-volume of the sphere Sn−1, and the subindex in the
symbol ∼means that the constant behind this symbol depends only on the dimension
n. Thisexponentialbehaviour, aswellasthemetricpropertiesof Hn, maketheclassical
covering arguments fail. In consequence, it is unclear how to decompose the level set
{x∈ Hn:Mf(x)> λ}in such way that the appropriate averages of wappear.
As in the euclidean case, from now on, given a non-negative measurable function w(a
weight) defined on Hn, letw(E) =R
Ew(x)dµn(x)for a measurable set E⊂ Hn. On
the other hand, given s >1, let
Msw=M(ws)1/s.
Using this notation, our first main result is the following variant of the Fefferman-Stein
inequality.
Theorem 1.1. For every weight w≥0we have that
w({x∈ Hn:Mf(x)> λ})≤Cs,n1
λZ
Hn|f(x)|Msw(x)dµn(x)
where the constant Cs,n→+∞when s→1.
This theorem is a generalization of the result of Strömberg [17], and as far as we know,
it represents the first result for general weights in the hyperbolic setting. The reader
may wonder if this result could hold for s= 1. We will show that this result is false
in general if s= 1(see Example 4.1 item 1 below). Moreover, our example shows that
it is false, even if we put iterations of the maximal function in the right hand side.WEIGHTED MAXIMAL INEQUALITIES ON HYPERBOLIC SPACES 3
In some sense, this is an evidence of a stronger singularity of the maximal function in
the hyperbolic setting. In Section 4 we will show that there are non trivial weights
satisfying the pointwise condition Ms(w)(x)≤Cw(x)a.ex∈ Hn. Then, for these
weights it holds that the maximal function Msatisfies the weak type (1,1)respect to
the measure wdµ n.
About the proof of Theorem 1.1.For each r >0, letArbe the averaging operator
Arf(x) =1
µn(BH(x, r))Z
BH(x,r)|f(y)|dµn(y).
Hence Mf(x) = supr≥0Arf(x). IfMloc(f)denotes the operator obtained if supremum
is restricted to r≤2, and Mfar(f)denotes the operator obtained if the supremum is
taken over all r≥2, then
Mf(x)≤Mlocf(x) +Mfarf(x).
Ontheonehand, theoperator MlocbehavesasintheEuclideansetting. Themaindiffi-
cultiesappearintheestimationsof Mfar. In[17], Strömbergusesapointwiseinequality
obtained by Clerc and Stein in [3]. This pointwise inequality reduced the problem to
get a good estimate for a convolution operator associated with a k-bi-invariant kernel τ,
which in the case of hyperbolic setting is τ(z, w) = (1 + µn(B(0, d(z, w))−1. A similar
approach was used by Li and Lohoué in [9] to obtain sharp constants with respect to
the dimension n. However, Strömberg’s argument strongly uses the homogeneity of the
measure µn. So, it is not clear that one can apply a similar idea in the general case of
any weight w. This makes it necessary to look for a more flexible approach.
Our general strategy is based in the scheme used by Naor and Tao in [11], where the
weak type (1,1)of the centered maximal function on the discrete setting of rooted
k-ary trees is obtained. The flexibility of this approach was shown in [13] and [14],
where the authors used this approach to get weighted estimates in the same discrete
setting. It is well known that regular trees can be thought as discrete models of the
hyperbolic space. Moreover, this kind of heuristic was used by Cowling, Meda and Setti
in [2], but in the other way round, that is, in this work the authors used Strömberg’s
approach to prove weak estimates in the setting of trees. A novelty of our paper is to
bring ideas of the discrete setting to the continue hyperbolic context. Adapting this
strategy to a continuous context requires overcoming certain obstacles. On the one
hand, the combinatorial arguments used in the discrete setting of trees are not longer
available, so they have to be replaced by geometrical arguments. In this sense, the4 JORGE ANTEZANA AND SHELDY OMBROSI

setting the measure is not atomic. This leads us to make some estimations on some
convenientaveragesoftheoriginalfunctioninsteadofthefunctionitself(seeforinstance
Lemma 3.3).
1.2.Weighted estimates in the hyperbolic space for p > 1.In the Euclidean
case, the weak and strong boundedness of the maximal operator Min weighted Lp
spaces is completely characterized by the Apcondition defined in the seminal work of
Muckenhoupt [10]:
(1.2) sup1

where the supremum is taken over all the Euclidean balls. Different type of weighted
inequalitieswereprovedformeasuressuchthatthemeasureoftheballsgrowspolynom-
ically with respect to the radius (see for instance [5], [12], [15], [18], and [19]). However,
the techniques used in those works can not be applied in our framework because of the
geometric properties of Hnand the exponential growth of the measures of balls with
respect to the radius. Unweighted strong (p, p)inequalities for the maximal function
were proved for p >1by Clerc and Stein in [3]. Moreover, singular integral operators
also were studied on symmetric spaces by Ionescu ([6, 7]).
Roughly speaking, in the hyperbolic spaces, the behaviour of the maximal function is
a kind of combination of what happens in the Euclidean case and in the trees. More
precisely, recall that we have defined the operators
Mlocf(x) = sup
0<r≤2Arf(x)and Mfarf(x) = sup
2<rArf(x).
As we have already mentioned, the operator Mlocbehaves as if it were defined in the
Euclidean space. So, it is natural to expect that it boundedness could be controlled by
a kind of “local Apcondition”. We say that a weight w∈Ap,loc(Hn)if

The situation is very different for large values of the radius, when the hyperbolic struc-
ture comes into play. For instance, it is not difficult to show that the natural Ap
condition is too strong for the boundedness of Mfarin the hyperbolic setting. Indeed,
in the Example 4.1 we show a weight for which the maximal function is bounded in all
theLp-spaces, but it does not belong to any (hyperbolic) Apclass. This suggests to
follow a different approach. Inspired by the condition introduced in [14], in the case
ofk-ary trees, we are able to define sufficient conditions to obtain weak and strong
estimates for the maximal function respect to a weight w. Our main result in this
direction is the following:
Theorem 1.2. Letp >1andwa weight. Suppose that
i.)w∈Ap,loc(Hn).
ii.)There exist 0< β < 1andβ≤α < psuch that for every r≥1we have
(1.3)Z
FAr(χE)(y)w(y)dµn(y)≲e(n−1)r(β−1)w(E)α
pw(F)1−α
p,
for any pair of measurable subsets E, F⊆ Hn.
Then
(1.4) ∥Mf∥Lp,∞(w)≲∥f∥Lp(w).
Furthermore, if β < αthen for each fixed γ≥0we have
(1.5)∞X
j=1jγ∥Ajf∥Lp(w)≲∥f∥Lp(w).
And therefore
∥Mf∥Lp(w)≲∥f∥Lp(w),
∥Mf∥Lp′(σ)≲∥f∥Lp′(σ),
where σ=w1−p′andp′=p
p−1.
Remark 1.3. We observe that the estimate (1.5) in the previous theorem is stronger
than the boundedness of the maximal function Mfar(f). In particular, it implies that
if an operator Tsatisfies the pointwise estimate
|Tf(x)|≲Mloc(|f|)(x) +X
j≥1jγAj(|f|)(x),
for some γ≥0, then the requested conditions on the weight win Theorem 1.2 will be
sufficient condition for the boundedness of Tin the space Lp(w)with p >1. In partic-
ular, this generalized, in the hyperbolic setting, the unweighted estimates obtained by
Clerc and Stein in [3, Thm. 2] for the maximal function.6 JORGE ANTEZANA AND SHELDY OMBROSI
Remark 1.4. It is not clear whether or not the condition (1.3) for α=βis a necessary
condition for the weak type (p, p)boundedness of Mwith respect to w. However, the
condition is sharp in the following sense: if β=αwe can construct a weight for which
the weak type (p, p)holds, but the strong type (p, p)fails. Consequently, the weak
type (q, q)fails as well for every q < p(see Example 4.1 (2)). In particular, this shows
that, unlike the classical case, in the hyperbolic context the weak (p, p)inequality with
respect to wof the maximal operator is not equivalent to the strong estimate for p >1.
The condition (1.3) could be not easy to be checked. For this reason, we consider the
following result which provides a more tractable condition. To simplify the statement,
given a positive integer j, let
Cj=B(0, j)\B(0, j−1).
Observe that the sets considered in the condition in (1.3) may have non-empty intersec-
tion with several different levels Cj. The condition in the following proposition studies
the behavior of the weight at each level.
Proposition 1.5. Let1< p < ∞, and let wbe a weight such that there exists a real
number δ <1, so that for every j, l, r≥1integers with the restriction |l−j| ≤r, we
have that
(1.6) w(Cl∩B(x, r))≲e(n−1)r+l−j
2(p−δ)e(n−1)rδw(x),for a.e. x∈ Cj.
Then, the condition (1.3)in Theorem 1.2holds with β=α=p
p−δ+1.
Combining Theorem 1.2, Remark 1.3 and Proposition 1.5 we obtain the following corol-
lary.
Corollary 1.6. Let1≤p <∞, and w∈Ap,loc(Hn)such that there exists a real
number δ <1such that for every j, l, r≥1integers with the restriction |l−j| ≤r, we
have that
w(Cl∩B(x, r))≲e(n−1)r+l−j
2(p−δ)e(n−1)rδw(x),for a.e. x∈ Cj.
Then
∥Mf∥Lp,∞(w)≲∥f∥Lp(w).
Furthermore, if p < qwe have
∥Tf∥Lq(w)≲∥f∥Lq(w),
for every operator Tsatisfying the pointwise estimate
|Tf(x)|≲Mloc(|f|)(x) +jγX
j≥1Aj(|f|)(x),
for some γ≥0.WEIGHTED MAXIMAL INEQUALITIES ON HYPERBOLIC SPACES 7
1.3.Organization of the paper. This paper is organized as follow. In Section 2 we
prove an estimate on the measure of the intersection of two hyperbolic balls. Section 3
is devoted to the proof of the main results of this paper. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is
contained in Subsection 3.1, while the proof of Theorem 1.2 is contained in Subsection
3.2. The Section 3 concludes with the proof of Proposition 1.5. The Section 4 contains
examples that clarify several points previously mentioned. Finally, the paper concludes
with an appendix on the ball model of the hyperbolic space.
2.Geometric results
2.1.The hyperbolic space. Although the precise realisation of hyperbolic space is
not important for our purposes, for sake of concreteness, throughout this article we will
consider the ball model. Recall that µndenotes the volume measure, and by dnwe will
denote the hyperbolic distance. A brief review of some basic facts about this model
and its isometries is left to the Appendix A.
2.2.Two results on the intersection of balls in the hyperbolic space. This
subsection is devoted to prove the following two geometric results, which will be very
important in the sequel.
Proposition 2.1. LetBH(y, s)andBH(x, r)be two balls in Hn. Then
µn
BH(y, s)∩BH(x, r)
≤Cnen−1
2(r+s−dn(x,y) ),
where Cnis a constant that only depends on the dimension.
Proof.We can assume that BH(y, s)∩BH(x, r)̸=∅. On the other hand, since the
estimate is trivial if randsare less than a fixed constant, we can also assume that
r, s > 2. Without loss of generality, we can assume that y= 0andx= (d,0, . . . , 0)
with d=dn(x, y). Note that we can also assume that d >0, otherwise the estimate is
trivial. The geodesic passing through the centers is the segment
L={(t,0, . . . , 0) :t∈(−1,1)}.
Since the balls are symmetric with respect to this geodesic line, the intersection is also
symmetric with respect to this line. Let OL(n−1)be the subgroup of the orthogonal
group O(n)defined by
OL(n) ={A∈O(n) :A leaves invariant the geodesic line L},
then the intersection is invariant by the action of OL(n−1). Moreover, the subgroup
OL(n−1)acts transitively in the intersection of the boundaries ∂BH(0, s)∩∂BH(x, r),8 JORGE ANTEZANA AND SHELDY OMBROSI
which turns out to be an (n−2)-sphere. Let Sdenote this intersection of boundaries,
and consider the point m∈Lthat satisfies
dn(0, m) =s+d−r
2⇐⇒ dn(m, x) =r+d−s
2.
Since Lis a symmetry axis for S, the points in Sare at the same distance to the point
m. Let ρdenote this distance. The volume of the ball of radius ρcan be estimated
using the hyperbolic law of cosines. Take q∈S, and consider the two dimensional
hyperbolic (also linear) plane Pcontaining qandL. Let us restrict our attention to
this hyperbolic plane (see Figure 1).

Now, it is enough to prove that BH(0, s)∩BH(x, r)⊆BH(m, ρ). Since the intersection
is an open-connected set, it is enough to prove that the boundary BH(m, ρ)is not
contained in the intersection. So, take p∈∂BH(m, ρ). By a continuity argument, we
can assume that p /∈L. Then, as before, consider the plane Pgenerated by pand the
geodesic L. The geodesic Ldivide this plane in two parts. Let qbe the unique point
inP∩Sin the same half-plane as p, and suppose that θp=∠(p, m, x )is greater or
equal than θq=∠(q, m, x )(see Figure 3).

gument, replacing the vertex xby the vertex 0shows that t /∈BH(0, s). This concludes
the proof. ■

3.1.Proof of Theorem 1.1. The first step consists on proving that Lemma 2.1 leads
to the following result. This is a key point to push the scheme on the discrete cases in
[11] or [13]. Recall that, given r≥0, we denote by Arthe averaging operator
Arf(x) =1

y∈BH(x,r)|f(x)|dµn(x).

Proof.We divide the hyperbolic Hnin level sets as follows
Hn=∞[
j=1Cj,
where Cj={x∈ Hn:j−1≤dH(0, x)< j}. Let Ej=E∩ CjandFℓ=F∩ Cℓ. Hence,
we can write

Indeed, note that in the right-hand side of (3.8), the second term is dominated by the

Combining the ingredients above we are in position to settle Theorem 1.1.

Hnf(x)A2(Msw)(x)dµn(x).
Now, if wis identically 1we have A2(Msw)(x) = 1and we are done. In particular, this
recovers the Strömberg’s weak type (1,1)estimate. If wis not constant, we claim that
A2((Msw)) (x)≲sMsw(x).
Indeed,

for every y∈B(x,2). Using Kolmogorov’s inequality and the weak type (1,1)ofMthe
first term can be estimate by cβ(A4(ws)(x))1
sand the claim follows. This completes
the proof in the general case. ■
3.2.Proof of Theorem 1.2. The proof of Theorem 1.2 follows the same ideas of
the proof of Theorem 1.1. in [14]. First, the hypothesis w∈Ap,loc(Hn)implies the
estimates for Mlocby standard arguments as in the classical setting. On the other
hand, the arguments used to prove that Lemma 3.2 implies Lemma 3.3 can be used to
prove that the hypothesis in Theorem 1.2 implies that

This inequality shows that the case β < αproduces a better estimate than the case
β=α. First of all, assume that we are in the worst case β=α. Arguing as in the
proof of Theorem 1.1 we get

Since|A2(f)(x)| ≤Mlocf(x)andw∈Ap,loc(Hn), paying a constant we can eliminate
A2in the right hand side of the previous estimate, and the proof is complete in this
case. If we assume that β < α, then by (3.9) we have that

This leads to (1.5). From (1.5) and the fact thatP∞
j=1Aj(f)is self-adjoint ( γ= 0)
we obtain the boundedness of Mfarin the spaces Lp(w)andLp′(σ). Moreover, since
w∈Ap,loc(Hn)and therefore σis inAp′,loc(Hn)we have the same inequalities for Mloc,
and as a consequence we obtain
∥Mf∥Lp(w)≲∥f∥Lp(w)
∥Mf∥Lp′(σ)≲∥f∥Lp′(σ)
This ends the proof of the Theorem.
3.3.Proof of Proposition 1.5. The proof follows similar ideas as Lemma 3.2.

w(Ωx

Lemma 3.1 we obtain (3.10).

4.Examples
In this last section we show several examples to clarify several points previously men-
tioned. We omit details since the examples follow from continue variants of Theorem
1.3 in [14].
Let−∞< γ≤1, we denote
wγ(x) =1 
1 +µn(B(0, dH(0, x) )γ.
Examples 4.1.
(1) If 0≤γ≤1, then
M(wγ)(x)≲wγ(x)
In particular if γ <1taking s >1such that γs≤1we have that
Ms(wγ)(x)≲wγ(x)
Therefore there are non trivial weights satisfying Ms(w)≲w. On the other
hand, Mw 1(x)≲w1(x). However, the weak type (1,1)ofMwith respect to
w1fails. In fact, taking fk(x) =χCk(x)forkbig, it is not difficult to show that
w1{x:M(fk)(x)>1/2} ≥kand the L1(w1)-norm of fkis uniformly bounded.
In particular, this example shows that in Theorem 1.1 is not possible to put
s= 1. In fact, it is not possible to put any iteration ( Mm(f) =M(Mm−1f))
ofMfor any fixed natural number m.
(2) Let p >1. Then w1−p(x)satisfies the hypothesis of Corollary 1.6 and therefore
∥Mf∥Lp,∞(w1−p)≲∥f∥Lp(w1−p)
holds. Nevertheless, ∥Mf∥Lp(w1−p)≲∥f∥Lp(w1−p)does not. This can be seen
by considering the function f=χB(0,1), and taking into account that w≃
(Mχ B(0,1))1−p.
(3) Fixed γ∈(0,1). We have seen in the item 1 that the maximal function satisfies
a weak type (1,1)inequality for this weight. In particular, for every q >1,
∥Mf∥Lq(wγ)≲∥f∥Lq(wγ).
However, it is not difficult to see that, for any fixed p >1, it holds that

This example shows that boundedness of Mdoes not imply the natural condi-
tionApfor any p >1in this setting. In the Euclidean setting in the context of
a general measure µan example in this line was also obtained by Lerner in [8].WEIGHTED MAXIMAL INEQUALITIES ON HYPERBOLIC SPACES 19
Appendix A.The ball model of the hyperbolic space
LetBn={x∈Rn:∥x∥<1}, where ∥ · ∥denotes the euclidean norm in Rn. In this
ball we will consider the following Riemannian structure
ds2
x(v) =2∥v∥2
(1− ∥x∥2)2.
The hyperbolic distance in this model can be computed by
dn(x, y) = arctanh 
∥x−y∥
(1−2⟨x, y⟩+∥x∥2∥y∥2)1
2!
.
The group of isometries I(Bn)in this representation coincides with the group of con-
formal diffeomorphisms from Bnonto itself. For n= 2, we can identify R2withC, and
this group is the one generated by:
•Rotations: z7→eitz,t∈R.
•Möbius maps: z7→z−w
1−¯wz.
•Conjugation: z7→z.
For dimension n >2, recall that, by Liouville’s theorem, every conformal map between
two domains of Rnhas the form
x7→λA◦ιx0,α(x) +b
where λ >0,b∈Rn,Abelongs to the orthogonal group O(n), and for x0∈Rn,α∈R
ιx0,α(x) =αx−x0
∥x−x0∥2+x0.
Note that, when α > 0, the maps ιx0,αcorrespond to a reflection with respect to the
sphere
Sn−1(x0, α) ={x∈Rn:∥x−x0∥2=α}.
Ifα <0, it is a composition of the inversion with respect to the sphere Sn−1(x0,−α)
and the symmetry centered at x0. Using this result, we get that the group I(Bn)
consists of the maps of the form
A◦θ
where Abelongstotheorthogonalgroup O(n)andθiseithertheidentityoraninversion
with respect to a sphere that intersect orthogonally ∂Bn. Recall that we say that two
spheres S1andS2intersects orthogonally if for every p∈S1∩S2
(TpS1)⊥⊥(TpS2)⊥.
Remark A.1. This representation is also true for n= 2. Indeed, on the one hand, the
rotations as well as the conjugation belongs to O(2). On the other hand, given α∈C20 JORGE ANTEZANA AND SHELDY OMBROSI
such that |α|<1, the circle of center α−1and squared radius |α|−2−1is orthogonal
to∂B2, and if ιdenotes the inversion with respect to this circle then
ι(z) =z−w
1−¯wz.
In this model, the r-dimensional hyperbolic subspaces that contains the origin are pre-
cisely the intersection the r-dimensional linear subspaces of RdwithBn. The other
ones, are images of these ones by isometries. So, they are r-dimensional spheres or-
thogonal to ∂Bn. The orthogonality in this case, as before, is defined in the natural
way in terms of the orthogonal complements of the corresponding tangent spaces.
