Abstract
Is emotional well-being monotonically increasing in the level of income o r does it reach a
plateau at some income threshold, whereafter additional income do es not contribute to further
well-being? Conﬂicting answers to this question has been suggested in the academic literature.
In a recent paper, using an income threshold of $100,000 per year, Killingsworth et al. (2023)
appears to have resolved these conﬂicts, concluding that emotion al well-being is monotoni-
cally increasing in income for all but the unhappiest individuals. In this p aper, we show that
this conclusion is sensitive to the placement of the income threshold a t which the relationship
between emotional well-being and income is allowed to plateau. Using st andard econometric
methods, we propose a data-driven approach to detect the place ment of the threshold. Using
this data-driven income threshold, a ﬂat relationship between hous ehold income and emotional
well-being above a threshold around $200,000 per year is found. While our analysis relaxes
the assumption of a pre-speciﬁed income threshold, it relies on a num ber of other assumptions,
which we brieﬂy discuss. We conclude that although the analysis of th is paper provides some
evidence for well-being plateauing around $200,000 per year, more research is needed before
any deﬁnite conclusions about the relationship between emotional w ell-being and income can
be drawn.

11 Introduction
Is well-being monotonically increasing in the level of inco me or does it reach a plateau at some
income threshold? The answer to this question has important implications for both personal choice
and publicpolicy. Two measures of well-being are generally distinguishedbetween in theliterature,
namelyemotional well-being and evaluative well-being (e.g. Diener et al. ,2010). Emotional well-
being refers to how an individual experiences their everyda y life, while evaluative well-being refers
to how an individual evaluates her own life as a whole. It has b een found that evaluative well-
being is monotonically increasing in the level of income (e. g.Kahneman and Deaton ,2010), but
the relationship between emotional well-being and income i s more disputed.
In a seminal paper, Kahneman and Deaton (2010) analyzed a survey of more than 450,000 US
citizens and found that emotional well-being increases lin early with household log-income up to a
certain threshold, determined to be around $75,000 per year, whereafter additional income does
not increase well-being further. A similar conclusion was r eached in Jebb et al. (2018). Later, ana-
lyzing data sampled in real time using smartphone notiﬁcati ons,Killingsworth (2021) re-examined
this question and found that emotional well-being increase s monotonically with log-income with-
out reaching a plateau. Recently, in a notable instance of “a dversarial collaboration”, Daniel
Kahneman and Matthew Killingsworth teamed up to resolve the apparent conﬂict between these
ﬁndings ( Killingsworth et al. ,2023). Using linear regression, Killingsworth et al. (2023) validates
the ﬁndings of Killingsworth (2021), i.e. that emotional well-being increases monotonically with
log-income without reaching a plateau. Using quantile regr ession,Killingsworth et al. (2023) ﬁnds
that emotional well-being does in fact plateau at the thresh old$100,000 per year, but only for
the most unhappy individuals in the sample. ( $100,000 being the inﬂation-adjusted value of the
$75,000 threshold used in Kahneman and Deaton ,2010) For the remaining parts of the sample,
however, it is again found that emotional well-being increa ses monotonically with log-income with-
out reaching a plateau. For the happiest individuals, an “ac celerating” pattern is even found,
where the relationship between emotional well-being and lo g-income becomes even stronger above
the threshold.
The analyses in the above-mentioned papers rest on two cruci al assumptions. The ﬁrst as-
sumption is that the relationship between well-being and lo g-income is piecewise linear with one
change in both intercept and slope. The second assumption is that the change occurs at the income
threshold $100,000 (or $75,000) per year. In this paper, we examine the eﬀects on the an alysis
2when we retain the ﬁrst assumption and relax the second. We us e standard econometric meth-
ods to detect the placement of a structural break in a linear m odel (e.g. Bai and Perron ,1998;
Perron,2006). Re-doing the linear regression analysis of Killingsworth et al. (2023) with a data-
driven placement of the threshold, we ﬁnd that emotional wel l-being does in fact plateau, but the
threshold is found to be between $175,000 and $250,000, substantially higher than the $100,000
used inKillingsworth (2021) andKillingsworth et al. (2023). Then, using the data-driven thresh-
old, we re-do the quantile regression analysis of Killingsworth et al. (2023) and ﬁnd evidence of
a plateau in the relationship between emotional well-being and log-income, regardless of the part
(quantile) of the well-being distribution considered. Alt hough the analysis presented in this paper
relaxes a crucial assumption compared to the previous liter ature, it still imposes a number of quite
stringent assumptions. We close the paper by brieﬂy discuss ing these assumptions and argue that
more research is needed before any deﬁnite conclusions abou t the relationship between emotional
well-being and income can be drawn.
2 Data
In this paper, we use the data made available by Killingsworth et al. (2023).1These data are
constructed from 1,725,944 experience-sampling reports f rom 33,391 employed adults aged 18 to 65
living in the United States, collected using smartphone not iﬁcations to obtain real-time evaluations
of experienced (i.e. emotional) well-being. Well-being wa s reported on a continuous scale between
“Very bad” and “Very good”, converted into a number between 0 and 100, and subsequently an
average number was constructed for each individual, leadin g to 33,391 data points. The only
explanatory variable used in Killingsworth et al. (2023) was annual pre-tax household income,
whichwasbracketed into15incomegroupslabeled $15000, $25000, $35000, $45000, $55000, $65000,
$75000, $85000, $95000, $112500, $137500, $175000, $250000, $400000, and $625000. We refer to
Killingsworth (2021) for further details on the data.
3 Empirical analysis
In Section 3.1we use ordinary least squares regression to examine the rela tionship between the
conditional mean of emotional well-being and log-income. I n Section 3.2we use quantile regression

3to examine the relationship between the conditional quanti les of emotional well-being and log-
income. We reproduce the analyses of Killingsworth et al. (2023) by inserting a structural break
in the linear relationship at the pre-speciﬁed threshold $100,000 per year, and compare with an
alternative analysis using a threshold that has been chosen in a data-driven way using standard
econometric methods.
3.1 Ordinary least squares regression analysis
We consider the following model
E(zi|xi) = (a+bxi)I(exp(xi)≤τ)+(c+dxi)I(exp(xi)> τ), i= 1,2,...,33391,(1)
wherea,b,c,d∈R,ziis a measure of well-being of individual i,xiis the log-income of individual
i,E(zi|xi) is the mean of zi, conditional on xi, andI(A) is the indicator function of the event
A, i.e. it is equal to one if Ais true and zero otherwise. We follow Killingsworth (2021) and
Killingsworth et al. (2023) and let zibe the z-scored well-being level reported by individual i, i.e.
zi:=yi−y
sy,
wherey:=N−1/summationtextN
i=1yiis the sample mean and s2
y:= (N−1)−1/summationtextN
i=1(yi−y)2is the sample
variance of the reported well-being levels, with N= 33,391 being the sample size.
The model for the conditional mean of ziin (1) is piecewise linear in log-income xi. It features a
structuralbreakinbothintercept andslopeat thethreshol dvalueτ; forexp( xi)≤τtheintercept is
aandslopeis b, whileforexp( xi)> τtheintercept is candslope d. Thismodelhasbeenextensively
used in the literature (e.g. Kahneman and Deaton ,2010;Killingsworth ,2021;Killingsworth et al. ,
2023) but the value for the threshold τhas arguably been chosen rather arbitrarily. For instance,
τis set equal to $100,000 in Killingsworth (2021) andKillingsworth et al. (2023), which is simply
the inﬂation-adjusted value used on a diﬀerent data set in Kahneman and Deaton (2010), where
τ=$75,000.
For agiven valueof τ, theparameters a,b,c,din(1)may beestimated viaordinaryleast squares
regression. We follow the econometrics literature on detec ting “structural breaks” in regression
models and propose to choose the threshold τas the place where the sum of squared residuals of
the regression analysis is minimized ( Bai and Perron ,1998;Perron,2006). The sum of squared
residuals for various placements of the threshold are shown in the left panel of Figure 1. The
optimal threshold is found to be between $175,000 and $250,000. In the right panel of Figure
41, we plot the estimated relationship ( 1) between well-being and log-income using this optimal
threshold. For comparison, the middle panel of Figure 1presents the estimated relationship using
the$100,000 threshold. The latter is a replication of the result s fromKillingsworth et al. (2023)
and shows a consistently increasing pattern, but the former shows that choosing the threshold in
a data-driven way leads to a ﬂat relationship between income and well-being above the threshold.
3.2 Quantile regression analysis
We now consider the following model
Qyi|xi(p) = (a+bxi)I(exp(xi)≤τ)+(c+dxi)I(exp(xi)> τ), i= 1,2,...,33391,(2)
wherea,b,c,d∈R,I(·) andτas above, and Qyi|xi(p) is thep’th quantile of yi, conditional on
xi, withp∈(0,1). Note that we here follow Killingsworth et al. (2023) and consider the level of
well-being yias the dependent variable, and not the z-scored version zias we did in ( 1). Otherwise,
the model ( 2) is similar to ( 1), except that it is a model of the conditional quantile, inst ead of the
conditional mean, of the well-being measure.
For given values of τandp, the parameters a,b,c,din (2) may be estimated via standard
quantile regression methods (e.g. Koenker,2005). Following Killingsworth et al. (2023), we con-
sider the quantiles p= 15%,30%,50%,70%,85% of the well-being distribution. The left panel
of Figure 2presents the results with the τ=$100,000 threshold, which is a replication of the
results from Killingsworth et al. (2023) and shows a consistently increasing pattern for all but the
unhappiest individuals in the sample. For the happiest indi viduals, the slope even increases above
the threshold, pointing to an “accelerating” pattern, wher e the happiest individuals appear to
get relatively higher well-being beneﬁts from additional i ncome when their income is already very
high. The right panel of Figure 2presents the results with the τ=$200,000 threshold suggested
by our previous analysis, and shows that choosing the thresh old in a data-driven way leads to a
ﬂat relationship between income and well-being above the th reshold, regardless of the part of the
well-being distribution considered.
4 Conclusion
The analysis of this paper challenges the ﬁnding of a monoton ically increasing relationship between
emotional well-being and income for all but the most unhappy people, recently reported in the lit-
erature ( Killingsworth et al. ,2023). Indeed, our analysis shows that this conclusion rests cru cially
5on pre-specifying the income threshold at $100,000 per year; by choosing the threshold in a data-
driven way, a ﬂat relationship between emotional well-bein g and income above a threshold around
$200,000 is found, regardless of the part (i.e. quantile) of t he well-being distribution considered.
To put this threshold number in perspective, we note that sli ghtly more than 9% of the sample
reported household incomes of $250,000 or higher. The incomes in the sample matches the US
census distribution closely ( Killingsworth ,2021).
Theanalysisof thepresentpaper, inturn, restsontheassum ptionthat therelationshipbetween
emotional well-being and log-income is linear with one stru ctural break in both intercept and slope.
While this assumptionhas beenroutinely imposedin thelite rature, it is not given that it is satisﬁed
in practice. Another potential drawback of the analysis con ducted here (and elsewhere) is the
bracketing of incomes into income groups, which may introdu ce biases in the results due censoring
of the explanatory (income) variable. Further, it is genera lly believed that well-being depends
on a multitude of factors besides income (e.g. Diener,2000;Diener et al. ,2002), leading to the
conjecture that there may be omitted variables in the regres sion equations ( 1) and (2). What the
eﬀects of theseomissionsandshortcomingsaretotheanalysi s oftherelationshipbetween emotional
well-being and income remains unknown. Thus, although the a nalysis of this paper provides some
evidence for emotional well-being plateauing around $200,000 per year, more careful research is
needed before any deﬁnite conclusions about this relations hip can be drawn with conﬁdence.
