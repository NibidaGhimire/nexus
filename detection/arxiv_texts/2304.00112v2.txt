Spiking neural network models characterize the emergent collective dynamics of circuits of bio-
logical neurons and help engineer neuro-inspired solutions across ﬁelds. Most dynamical systems’
models of spiking neural networks typically exhibit one of two major types of interactions: First,
the response of a neuron’s state variable to incoming pulse signals (spikes) may be additive and in-
dependent of its current state. Second, the response may depend on the current neuron’s state and
multiply a function of the state variable. Here we reveal that spiking neural network models with
additive coupling are equivalent to models with multiplicative coupling for simultaneously modiﬁed
intrinsic neuron time evolution. As a consequence, the same collective dynamics can be attained
by state-dependent multiplicative and constant (state-independent) additive coupling. Such a map-
ping enables the transfer of theoretical insights between spiking neural network models with diﬀerent
types of interaction mechanisms as well as simpler and more eﬀective engineering applications.
I. BACKGROUND
Diﬀerential equations model the time evolution of a
broad range of natural and human-made systems with
time-continuous intrinsic dynamics and interactions. [1–
4]. The dynamics of systems with short-lasting inter-
actions may be modeled by networks of artiﬁcial pulse-
coupled or spiking neurons. They constitute hybrid dy-
namical systems where the intrinsic continuous time-
evolution of the units’ dynamics are interrupted by time-
discrete events. At these events, the incoming pulses
(spikes) deterministically change the state variables of
the units in the receiving end. The event times, in
turn, are determined by the state space trajectory pass-
ing certain subsets, e.g., crossing some manifold or hit-
ting boundary points of state space. Since half a century,
spiking and pulse-coupled network models play key roles
in our understanding of natural phenomena such as the
emergence of waves or synchrony [5–7]. They also help
to design appropriate collective dynamics for engineered
systems implementing desired functionalities such as dis-
tributed sensing [8–10].
Due to their hybrid nature, spiking systems exhibit,
and thus capture, novel phenomena not present in sys-
tems of smooth, time-continuous diﬀerential equations.
Examples include the emergence of linearly unstable at-
tractors (in the sense of Milnor) [11–13], the existence
of speed limits in the relaxation dynamics of networks
of spiking units [14, 15], the possibility of identical oscil-
lators overtaking each other even though they are sym-
metricallycoupled[16], andtheemergenceofisochronous
regions where multiple periodic orbits of the same period
coexist [17].
These phenomena have been demonstrated for mod-
els where the interactions are additive and the coupling
strength is constant, i.e. independent of the current state
of the unit that receives an interaction pulse signal.
However, several models of biological neural circuits
exhibit state-dependent, multiplicative coupling [18–21]
and recent conceptual works on artiﬁcial computationaldevices demonstrated that networks of pulse-coupled os-
cillatory neurons with multiplicative coupling give rise
to novel computational features such as reconﬁgurabil-
ity and improved robustness, see, e.g., [22] and [23]. In
addition, certain types of multiplicative coupling may be
simpler and more eﬃcient to implement in hardware.
Here we demonstrate that under certain conditions,
network models with state-dependent, multiplicative
coupling and models with constant additive coupling are
equivalent in the sense that they exhibit identical spik-
ing dynamics. The implications of this result are twofold.
First, many theoretical and practical results on oscilla-
tor networks with additive coupling can be transferred
to those with multiplicative coupling and vice versa, by
transforming the neuron model accordingly. In partic-
ular, the extensive body of work on additive coupling
systems can be carried over eﬀectively to multiplicative
coupling systems, while phenomena that have been de-
scribed for systems with multiplicative coupling, such as
robust and reconﬁgurable computation over a combina-
torial number of inputs observed in [22] should also be
expected for classes of additive-coupling systems. Sec-
ond, for technical applications such as the growing ﬁeld
of analogue and spiking computation, depending on the
particular neuron model and the coupling network, usu-
ally one type of coupling can be designed and imple-
mented more eﬀectively. For example, systems with
conductance-based leaky integrate-and-ﬁre (IF) neurons
allow for straightforward multiplicative coupling. Using
the connections established in this paper, one can choose
the coupling type more freely by modifying the neuron
model accordingly.
II. PULSE-COUPLED OSCILLATOR
NETWORKS AND PHASE FORMALISM
Consider an N-dimensional dynamical system with
statesxi(t),i∈{1,...,N}, with a dynamic deﬁned byarXiv:2304.00112v2  [physics.comp-ph]  11 Apr 20232

with continuous functions fi(xi) :R→R, and in-
teraction mediated by the terms Si({xj},t), where
{xj}={x1,...,xN}. In the following, we consider
oscillatory neurons as one core example [5, 12, 24–29],
where variables xiare typically interpreted as a poten-
tial. For implementing periodic free dynamics we require
thatfi(xi) :R→R+is positive and state a reset mech-
anism

which sets the state variable xito a reset value xreset:= 0

Together with the intrinsic dynamics deﬁned by equa-
tion (1) for Si= 0, the reset mechanism (2) creates a
free period Tifor each neuron. Note that the choice of
xthr≡1andxreset≡0is made without loss of generality.
The interaction between diﬀerent neurons, as described
by the functions Si({xj},t), can take on many forms.
Short-lasting, momentary interactions as found in bio-
logical systems such as populations of ﬂashing ﬁreﬂies or
networks of spiking neurons in the brain, are often ad-
equately captured in terms of pulse coupling. Within
this context, a neuron that reaches its threshold is said
to “ﬁre” or “spike”, and sends a stereotyped short-lasting
signal, whichmediatesitseﬀectonconnectedunits. Such
pulse coupling between oscillatory neurons can generally
be written as
Si(t) =−N/summationdisplay

τij≥0is the time it takes for a pulse to travel from neu-
ronjto neuroni. Note that for τij>0additional rules
regarding the order of processing spiking events may be
necessary. Often, pulse-coupled systems exhibit a strong
time scale separation between the interaction duration
and the intrinsic time scales of the neurons so that the
kernelsKijin(4)maybeidealizedasaDiracdistribution
Kij(t) =δ(t) (5)
such that the coupling (4) becomes discontinuous. In
this work, we focus on purely inhibitory coupling, i.e.,/epsilon1ij≥0. For simplicity of presentation, in the following
we setτij= 0(instantaneous interactions). However, we
point out that our ﬁndings easily generalize to delayed
systems.
The eﬀect of neuron jreaching threshold at time tj
(dropping the index mfor sake of readability) can be
summarized as instantaneous, discontinuous change of
the other neurons’ states xi,i/negationslash=jby a constant /epsilon1ij,
which is independent of both the time and the state xi
itself:
xi(t+
j) =xi(tj)−/epsilon1ij, (6)
for illustration see ﬁgure 1a,b. Note that large coupling
strengths/epsilon1ijmay lead to a negative potential xi(tj)−/epsilon1
just after a reset, requiring equation (1) to provide so-
lutions with xi<0for the non-interaction case S= 0.
This may pose a modeling problem, as naturally occur-
ring neurons typically have a ﬁnite lower boundary re-
garding their potential [29, 30].
The resulting dynamical system is of hybrid type with
continuous-time free (uncoupled) time evolution of neu-
ronstatesinterruptedbyoneoftwotypesofeventsoccur-
ring at discrete times, where maps are applied: i) reset
(eq. (2)) or ii) spike reception (eq. (6)). The hybrid
nature enables to transfer to new neuron state variables
that are time-like (phases), in terms of the phase for-
malism introduced by Mirollo-Strogatz [5]. Essentially a
nonlinear transformation, it parametrizes the free time
evolution of the oscillatory neurons in terms of periodic
phasesφi(t)that evolve with a constant phase velocity
dφi/dt=ωiuntil they reach the threshold value φthr
i:= 1
and are reset to 0. The interaction between diﬀerent neu-
rons is mediated via a so-called rise function or neuron
potentialUi(φi) :φi→(−∞,1], which is monotonically
increasing, twicecontinuouslydiﬀerentiableandtypically
normalized to Ui(0) = 0 andUi(1) = 1. Then, the re-
sponse of unit ion another unit jreaching the threshold

with transfer function

with/epsilon1≡/epsilon1ij. For a free dynamic of the form dxi/dt=
fi(xi), as in equation (1), it is always possible to choose
Ui(φi)≡xi(φiTi), (9)
wherexi(t)the free solution with period Ti. The phase
description of the free time evolution is then given by

Another common model class has been proposed by
Mirollo and Strogatz [5] directly in terms of a rise func-
tion
UMS,b(φ)≡1
bln(1 + (eb−1)φ), b> 0.(15)
It is chosen such that, while UMS,bitself is nonlinear and
allows for realistic features such as down-concavity, the
resulting transfer function is aﬃne,
HMS,b
/epsilon1(φ) =α/epsilon1φ+β/epsilon1, (16)
with constants α/epsilon1=e−b/epsilon1andβ/epsilon1= (e−b/epsilon1−1)/(eb−1),
allowing for easy analytical treatment. Note that UMS,b
diverges already for a ﬁnite value φ0≡1/(1−eb):
limφ→φ+
0UMS,b(φ) =−∞, whereas limφ→−∞UIF(φ) =
−∞for the integrate-and-ﬁre neuron. Hence, the eﬀect
of incoming pulses vanishes already at ﬁnite phases φ0,
and the permitted phases are bounded, φ∈(φ0,1], in-
stead ofφ∈(−∞,1], as for leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neu-
rons.
We emphasize again that the coupling considered up
to this point is additive in the original potential-like vari-
ablesxi.
III. MULTIPLICATIVE PULSE COUPLING
Although in many situations the additive pulse cou-
pling, as reviewed, in the last section is a ﬁtting descrip-
tion, other choices may capture underlying mechanisms
in existing systems better or can be implemented more
eﬀectively when designing systems. In the following, we
consider a type of inhibitory pulse coupling between os-
cillatoryneurons, inwhichtheeﬀectofanincomingpulse4

state ˜xi(tj)of the receiving oscillator,

whereκij∈(0,1). Throughoutweuseatildetopointout
multiplicative coupling, as opposed to additive coupling.
Again setting K(t) =δ(t), and assuming instantaneous
interactions, τij= 0, for simplicity of presentation, this
leads to an update rule
˜xi(t+
j) = (1−κij) ˜xi(tj), (18)
instead of the additive-coupling update rule (6).
InthefollowingwemodifytheMirollo-Strogatzformal-
ism to also describe inhibitory multiplicative coupling.
Given the free neuron dynamics in terms of a rise func-
tion ˜Ui(φi) :φi→(−∞,1], we deﬁne a multiplicative-
coupling transfer function
˜Hκ,i(φi):=˜U−1
i[˜Ui(φi)(1−κ)], (19)
so that the eﬀect of a neuron jresetting at time tjon
the phase of a connected neuron iis expressed as
φi(t+
j):=˜Hκ,i(φi(tj)), (20)
withκ=κij, analogous to equation (7) for standard ad-
ditive coupling. Now, the free time evolution is again
deﬁned bydφi/dt=ωiand a reset to φi= 0upon reach-
ing the threshold value φthr
i= 1,φi(t+
i):= 0. As with
additive coupling, for given free neuron dynamics ˜xi(t),
one can set ˜Ui(φi)≡˜xi(φiTi)anddφ/dt = 1/Ti, with
the free period length Ti.
For multiplicative inhibitory pulse coupling, only neu-
ron potentials with ˜Ui(φi)≥0are sensible, such that
˜Ui(φi)(1−κij)≥0, avoiding that the sign of the in-
duced phase jump changes in a physically implausible
way. Other than that, the requirements on ˜Uiare the
sameasforadditivecoupling, thatis, ˜Uishouldbemono-
tonicallyincreasingandtwicecontinuouslydiﬀerentiable.
Again, generalizationtosystemswithdelayedcouplingor
inhomogeneous coupling strengths are straightforward.
As an example, we again consider the common

section does not lead to an aﬃne transfer function any-
more, if we apply multiplicative coupling:

.(23)
However, we propose an alternative neuron potential,

which indeed leads to an aﬃne (and even linear) transfer
function
˜HMS,c
κ(φ) = (1−κ)cφ (25)
for multiplicative coupling, see ﬁgure 2a,b.

tion for multiplicative coupling. (a) While the rise func-
tion ˜UMS,c(φ)(see eq. (24)) itself is nonlinear, its respective
transfer function for multiplicative pulse coupling, ˜Hκ(φ), is
linear and allows for easy analytical treatment. Shown for
diﬀerent values of c, for ﬁxed coupling strength κ= 0.25.
IV. EQUIVALENCE OF MULTIPLICATIVE
AND ADDITIVE COUPLING
While with additive coupling (eq. (6), (7)) the state
variablexiof a spike-receiving neuron iis shifted by
a constant value −/epsilon1ij, with multiplicative coupling (eq.
(18), (16)) the state variable ˜xiexperiences a relative
shift−˜xiκij. However, both interaction mechanism can
be transferred into each other by simultaneously modify-
ing the rise function accordingly. For sake of simplicity
we focus only on a single neuron iat a time and drop
indexithroughout, and assume that all pulses arriving
at neuronihave the same strength: /epsilon1ij=/epsilon1i≡/epsilon1or
κij=κi≡κ. Below, we generalize to arbitrary coupling
strength, and thus also sparse networks, see section IVC.
Again writing U(φ)and ˜U(φ)for rise functions for ad-
ditive and multiplicative coupling, respectively, we de-
mand that the corresponding transfer functions
H/epsilon1(φ) =U−1[U(φ)−/epsilon1] (26)
and
˜Hκ(φ) =˜U−1/bracketleftbig˜U(φ)(1−κ)/bracketrightbig
(27)5
are equal, i.e.
H/epsilon1(φ)≡˜Hκ(φ) (28)
⇐⇒U−1[U(φ)−/epsilon1] =˜U−1/bracketleftbig˜U(φ)(1−κ)/bracketrightbig
,(29)
for allφ.
Main claim. As a main statement of this article we
have the following: Given a rise function U(φ)for ad-
ditive inhibitory pulse coupling with coupling strength
/epsilon1≥0, exactly the same spiking dynamics is realized
by multiplicative inhibitory pulse coupling with coupling
strengthκ∈[0,1)and rise function
˜U(φ) = (1−κ)/parenleftbig1−U(φ)
/epsilon1/parenrightbig
. (30)
Todemonstratethisclaim, wetakeseveralsteps. First,
we calculate the inverse ˜U−1of the rise function ˜U(eq.
(30)) with regard to variable φ, expressed in terms of the
inverse function U−1and ˜Uitself,
˜U−1=U−1/parenleftbig
1−/epsilon1log1−κ(˜U)/parenrightbig
, (31)
where log1−κdenotes the logarithm with base 1−κ. We
then use equations (30) and (31) to compute
˜U−1/bracketleftbig˜U(φ)(1−κ)/bracketrightbig
=U−1/parenleftbig
1−/epsilon1log1−κ(˜U(φ)(1−κ))/parenrightbig

=U−1/parenleftbigg
1−/epsilon1/parenleftbigg1−U(φ)
/epsilon1+ 1/parenrightbigg/parenrightbigg
=U−1[U(φ)−/epsilon1]. (32)
Hence, indeedthetransferfunctions, andthusthespiking
dynamics, are identical, H/epsilon1(φ) = ˜Hκ(φ), see equation
(28).
By solving equation (30) for ˜U(φ), we get the in-
verse transformation. Given a multiplicative-coupling
rise function ˜U(φ), the same system can be described
in terms of additive pulse coupling with rise function
U(φ) = 1−/epsilon1log1−κ(˜U(φ)). (33)
Equations (30) and (33) can be interpreted as fami-
lies of equivalent rise functions. For a given rise function
U(φ)for additive coupling and a given additive coupling
strength/epsilon1, the coupling strength κof the transformed
dynamics can be chosen freely, when ˜Uis chosen ac-
cordingly, so that κeﬀectively parametrizes the possible
equivalent multiplicative-coupling rise functions ˜U. In-
versely, possible transformations to additive coupling are
capturedbydiﬀerentchoicesofthenewcouplingstrength
/epsilon1, given a ﬁxed original multiplicative-coupling strength
κ. For heterogeneous coupling, we refer to section IVC.
While transformations (30), (33) are given in terms
of the rise functions U(φ)and ˜U(φ), they are easily
transferred to the actual neuron dynamics by letting
x(t) =U(φ(t)),˜x(t) =˜U(φ(t)):
˜x(t) = (1−κ)/parenleftbig1−x(t)
/epsilon1/parenrightbig
, (34)and
x(t) = 1−/epsilon1log1−κ(˜x(t)), (35)
where we assume x(T) = ˜x(T) =xthr= 1. We point
out that the period length Tand hence also the phase
velocitydφ/dt =ω= 1/Tis necessarily the same for
equivalent rise functions.
A. Additive to multiplicative coupling
First we consider the transformation from additive to
multiplicative coupling via equation (30), as illustrated
by ﬁgure 3a-c for two standard neuron models. Note
thatforthetransformedneurondynamics, ˜U(φ), wehave
˜U(0)>0. Indeed, from equation (30) we ﬁnd
˜UR= (1−κ)1−UR
/epsilon1,, (36)
where we write ˜UR=˜U(0)andUR=U(0)for the
reset potentials of ˜U(φ)andU(φ), respectively. Ac-
cording to equation (36) it is not possible to normal-
ize both to U(0) = 0 and ˜U(0) = 0 at the same time.
In fact, it is a necessary condition for the equivalence
between a multiplicative-coupling rise function ˜Uand
an additive-coupling rise function Uthat ˜U(φ0) = 0
andU(φ0) =−∞for the same phase φ0, or in the
limitφ→−∞. Illustratively speaking, ˜U(φ0) = 0and
U(φ0) =−∞deﬁne the phase φ0at which the eﬀect of
multiplicative and additive coupling, respectively, van-
ishes, which must be the same for equivalent dynamics.
If we require U(0) = 0 , as is usually done
for additive-coupling rise functions, the reset value
˜UR=˜U(0) = (1−κ)1//epsilon1>0is always larger than the
minimally allowed potential ˜U(φ) = 0. From a practical
perspective, the equivalent multiplicative coupling uses a
baseline potential ˜UG= 0lower than the reset potential
˜UR>0[ which can be considered a natural generalization
of the standard multiplicative coupling as introduced in
the last section.] In this case, UR= 0,˜UR>0, we can
also rewrite the transformation (30) in terms of the reset
voltage ˜URof the multiplicative coupling,
˜U(φ) =˜U(1−U(φ))
R. (37)
While in equation (30) the family of equivalent
multiplicative-coupling rise functions is parametrized in
terms of the coupling strengths κof the new coupling,
equation (37) parametrizes the possible transformations
in terms of ˜UR, from which the new coupling strength is
found asκ= 1−(˜UR)/epsilon1.
For example, consider the standard leaky integrate-
and-ﬁre potential (eq. (13))
UIF,add.(φ) =I

As before, we use a tilde to diﬀerentiate between rise
functions for multiplicative or additive pulse coupling;
the superset “ add.” denotes that the original model (here
integrate-and-ﬁre, “ IF”) was formulated for additive cou-
pling. Transforming via equation (30), we get an equiv-
alent rise function

We point out that for practical applications, the oﬀ-
set reset voltage, ˜UR>0, might be avoided by modi-
fying the transformed rise function ˜U(φ)in an interval
φ∈[0,δ]arbitrary close to the reset phase φ= 0, such
that ˜U(0) = 0and ˜U(φ)is still strictly monotonous and
continuous. While doing so might slightly change the
collective dynamics during transients, for stable orbits
in which neurons do not reach non-positive phases via
inhibition, δcan be chosen such that the dynamics are
completely equivalent to the original additive coupling.
B. Multiplicative to additive coupling
Figure 3d-f illustrates the transfer of multiplicative
to additive coupling via equation (33) in the case of
˜U(0) = ˜UR≡0. This represents the most natural for-
mulation for multiplicative coupling (as described in the
last section, also see ﬁgure 2), where the reset potential
˜URis equal to the ground potential ˜UG= 0. In this
case, the eﬀect of the coupling vanishes right at the reset
phaseφ= 0. Hence, no negative phases are necessary,φ∈[0,1]. However, multiplicative coupling with ˜UR= 0
requires a divergence of the additive-coupling rise func-
tionU(φ)atφ= 0,limφ→0+U(φ) =−∞, forbidding
normalization to UR=U(0)≡0, or any other ﬁnite
value.
Note that the phase φ1, above which the neu-
ron potential for additive coupling becomes positive,
U(φ1) = 0, is connected to the coupling strength /epsilon1via
(1−κ)1//epsilon1=˜U(φ1), so that it can be chosen freely within
(0,1)by adjusting /epsilon1accordingly, in principle arbitrary
close to 0. Instead of /epsilon1, we can also use φ1or˜U(φ1)
to parametrize the family of equivalent additive-coupling
transfer functions:
U(φ) = 1−log˜U(φ1)˜U(φ) = 1−ln˜U(φ)
ln˜U(φ1)(45)
Consider, for example, multiplicative coupling with a
standard leaky integrate-and-ﬁre rise function
˜UIF,mult.(φ) =I

and a corresponding transfer function

κ+ (1−κ)(1−γ/I)φ/parenrightbig
ln(1−γ/I),(47)
where we use the superscript “ mult.” to point out that
the original rise function is implemented for multiplica-
tive coupling. Via equation (33) we ﬁnd an equivalent
additive-coupling rise function
UIF,mult.(φ) = 1−/epsilon1log1−κ/parenleftbigg1−(1−γ/I)φ

As second example we give
˜UMS,c,mult.(φ) =φ1/c, c> 0,(49)
with a linear multiplicative-coupling transfer function
˜HMS,c,mult.
κ (φ) = (1−κ)cφ (50)

Additive-coupling rise functions as created by the
transformation (33) might be suﬃciently approximated
by rise function avoiding divergent behavior as φ→0+,
forφ→0+, allowing normalization to U(0) = 0. For a
practical example, see section VA.7

C. Inhomogeneous coupling strengths
In the last sections we demonstrated a general ap-
proach to transfer multiplicative pulse-coupling to ad-
ditive pulse-coupling and vice-versa. By setting /epsilon1ij≡/epsilon1
andκij≡κ, we implicitly assumed that the coupling
strengths/epsilon1ijdo not depend on the neuron jwhich is
sending the pulse, but only on the receiving neuron i
(whose index iwe suppressed throughout). However,
the equivalence between multiplicative and additive cou-
pling holds also for inhomogenuous coupling strengths
and coupling topologies deﬁned on networks. In order to
have equivalent dynamics for variable original coupling
strengths, not only the rise functions, but also the cou-
pling strengths itself are transformed via a mapping thatis uniquely determined by deﬁning two values of /epsilon1andκ
as equivalent. Consider equation (30) again:
˜U(φ) = (1−κ)/parenleftbig1−U(φ)
/epsilon1/parenrightbig
. (52)
The corresponding transfer functions for additive and
multiplicative coupling are equal not only for the speciﬁc
choice of/epsilon1,κused in the transformation (52) itself, but
also for any combination of additive and multiplicative
coupling strengths /epsilon1/primeandκ/primethat satisﬁes
κ/prime= 1−(1−κ)/epsilon1/prime//epsilon1, (53)
as can be veriﬁed analogously to equations (26)-(32).
Hence, for each neuron i, a single choice of two equivalent
couplingstrengthsdeﬁnesboththetransformedrisefunc-8
tionsaswellasthemappingbetweenarbitraryequivalent
coupling strengths /epsilon1ij,κij.
For transforming standard additive coupling with
UR=U(0) = 0 to multiplicative coupling, the map-
ping between equivalent coupling strengths may also be
deﬁned in terms of the reset voltage ˜UR=˜U(0)of the
new rise function, not requiring an explicit choice of two
equivalent coupling strengths. The new multiplicative-
coupling rise function is then given in terms of
˜U(φ) =˜U(1−U(φ))
R, (54)
see equation (37), while the mapping between equivalent
coupling strengths /epsilon1ij,κijis given by
κij= 1−˜U(/epsilon1ij)
R. (55)
Similarly, if the possible transformations of multiplica-
tive coupling with ˜UR= 0to additive coupling are
parametrized via the phase φ1for whichU(φ1) = 0,
U(φ) = 1−log˜U(φ1)˜U(φ) = 1−ln˜U(φ)
ln˜U(φ1),(56)
see equation (45)), the transformation between equiva-
lent coupling strengths κij,/epsilon1ijis deﬁned via
/epsilon1ij=log (1−κij)
log (˜U(φ1)). (57)
Interaction topologies deﬁned on a directed graph can
be either implemented explicitly in terms of an adjacency
matrixAijthat deﬁnes which neurons ireceive a pulse
from another neuron jor, implicitly, by setting /epsilon1ij= 0or
equivalently κij= 0for neurons that are not connected
in the speciﬁc direction. For an example of delayed het-
erogeneous coupling on a directed network, see the next
section.
V. EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS
A. Network computing
To give a practical example for a transformation from
multiplicative to additive pulse-coupling, we consider an
implementation of a k-winners-take-all ( k-WTA) compu-
tation based on an network of Ninhibitorily coupled os-
cillatory neurons, as proposed in [22]. The free dynamic
of neuroni∈{1,...,N}with state variable ˜xiis deﬁned
by diﬀerential equation
˙˜xi= (I−γ˜x)ξi(t), (58)
with constants I >γand external inputs ξi(t) :R→R+,
and a reset rule, which sets ˜xi(t+
i):= 0for each time ti
where ˜xi(ti) = ˜xthr≡1. Assuming that ξi(t)changes
much slower than the inputs xi(t), we get a free dynamic
˜xi(t) =I
γξi(t)(1−e−γt) for 0 <t≤T,(59)with free period length T=−(ξi(t)γ)−1ln(1−γ/I). The
interaction between diﬀerent neurons is given in terms of
all-to-all inhibitory multiplicative pulse-coupling
˜xi(t+
j) = (1−κ) ˜xi(tj), (60)
(cf. eq. (18)) with global coupling strength κ.
Now, for performing k-WTA computations, the
functionsξi(t), which set the intrinsic frequencies
ωi= 1/Ti∝ξi(t)of the individual neurons, are inter-
preted as the time-dependent input of the network, while
the stream of reset events (i.e. the sent pulses) deﬁne
the output space, see ﬁgure 4a. Upon varying ξi(t), the
system after a typically short transient converges to a
periodic orbit, in which only the k≤Nneurons with the
largest intrinsic frequencies ωispike, thereby revealing
the subset of the klargest input signals ξi. The num-
ber of “winners” kis selected by adjusting the global
coupling strength κaccordingly, allowing for easy re-
conﬁgurability. The underlying mechanism is summa-
rized as follows: Upon receiving a pulse from a neu-
roni, due to the multiplicative inhibitory coupling all
other neurons j/negationslash=iloose a certain share κof their volt-
age, pushing their voltages closer together on an absolute
scale. Depending on the inhibition strength, this allows
faster neurons to overtake slower ones repeatedly, poten-
tially keeping the latter from spiking altogether. Figure
4d,e illustrates typical dynamics with k= 2andk= 3,
for a speciﬁc choice of input signals ξi(t) =ξi(ﬁg. 4b)

by

Note that neither ˜Ui(φi)norUi(φi)depend on ξi(t)
itself because for the speciﬁc free dynamics as given by
equation (58) the shape of the rise function itself does
not change with ξi(t), but the intrinsic neuron frequency9

ωi= 1/Ti). For the illustrated transformation, we re-
quired that multiplicative coupling strength κ= 0.21
(for the ﬁrst orbit, with k= 2) is equivalent to ad-
ditive coupling strength /epsilon1= 0.1, so thatκ/prime= 0.19
(for the second orbit, with k= 3) is equivalent to
/epsilon1/prime=/epsilon1log (1−κ/prime)/log (1−κ)≈0.089, (cf. eq. (53)).
Figure 4i-k illustrates how additive coupling with
U(0) =UR=−∞can be eﬀectively approximated by a
modiﬁed additional-coupling rise function Uapp(φ)which
satisﬁesUapp(0) = 0 for a more practical implementa-
tion. Here, we require that Uapp(φ)≡U(φ)for phases
φ≥δ≡0.2and deﬁne Uapp(φ)forφ < δin terms of
cubic extrapolation which satisﬁes Uapp(0) = 0. For our
speciﬁc choice of δ= 0.2, the illustrated spiking dynam-
ics are in fact fully equivalent to both the original multi-
plicative and the exact additive transformation, because
the minimal phase reached upon inhibition is larger than
δ= 0.2(see ﬁg. 4i).
B. Topology-induced synchronization
As a second example, we consider a network with
delayed, heterogeneous coupling, implementing a phe-
nomenon initially addressed in [31] which relates topo-
logical features of directed interaction graphs with the
degree of synchronization in the resulting collective dy-
namics. Though originally described for continuously
coupled Kuramoto oscillators, we here reproduce the ef-fect for leaky-integrate and ﬁre-dynamics with delayed
additive inhibitory pulse coupling and then exemplarily
transfer the dynamics to multiplicative coupling.
Consider a network of Nidentical oscillatory neurons
with a leaky integrate-and-ﬁre dynamic
˙xi=I−γxi, (65)
withI= 1,γ= 0.9, and a reset rule which sets
xi(t+
i) = 0for each time tiwherexi(ti) =xthr≡1, lead-
ing to a free time evolution
xi(t) =I
γ(1−e−γt) for 0 <t≤T,(66)
with period length T=−γ−1ln(1−γ/I). The interac-
tion between diﬀerent units is given in terms of delayed
inhibitory additive pulse-coupling with
xi(t+
j+τ) =xi(tj+τ)−/epsilon1ij, (67)
(cf. eq. (6)), where τ >0. The coupling strengths /epsilon1ijare
given in terms of the adjacency matrix Aof an directed
graph with matrix elements Aij∈{0,1}as
/epsilon1ij=/epsilon1Aij/gi, (68)
wheregi=/summationtext
jAijis the in-degree of node iand/epsilon1 >0
is a global constant. Figure 5a,b depicts two interac-
tion graphs,GandG/prime, which are identical except for an
additional directed link between neurons 1and5in the
second graph.10

Figure 5e,f shows for both network topologies the rel-
ative time lag between reset events of the neurons after
a periodic orbit is reached, from the same random ini-
tial condition. While the ﬁrst interaction topology leads
to only partial phase synchronization (ﬁg. 5e), adding a
single link, A5,1:= 1, leads to full synchronization with
no phase lag at all (ﬁg. 5f). This is directly connected to
the strongly-connected components of the graphs Gand
G/prime, referred to as A,B, andC. While in the ﬁrst interac-
tion topology, AandBindependently aﬀect C, with no
feedback from Cback toAorCand no interaction at all
betweenAandB, in the second topology, component A
additionally aﬀects B. While forG,AandBsynchronize
independently to diﬀerent phases depending on the ini-
tial conditions and do not allow for Cto synchronize to
a single phase, for G/prime,Aacts as a single “source” of the
system, which synchronizes autonomously and forces its
phase on the rest of the network via directed connections
to all other nodes.In terms of the phase formalism, for the original addi-
tive coupling (eq. (67)), we have rise functions

Note that the neurons itself are identical in their free dy-
namics, and only diﬀer in their coupling strengths, and
hence their transfer functions, see ﬁgure 5c. Although
it is not strictly necessary, it is reasonable to maintain
identical free dynamics also when using multiplicative
coupling, resulting in diﬀerent coupling strengths κijfor
each pulse-receiving neuron i. Hence, we set the reset
voltage ˜UR=˜U(0)>0to be the same for each neuron,
˜UR≡0.1and use it to deﬁne the transformation to mul-
tiplicative coupling (see eq. (37)), leading to free neuron11

tions, the resulting spiking dynamic and hence also the

VI. CONCLUSION
Basic standard models of spiking neural networks such
as networks of leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neurons exhibit
additive interactions where the postsynaptic response of
a neuron is parametrized in terms of a coupling strength.
Other and more advanced models feature multiplicative
coupling where the state change of the postsynaptic neu-
ron depends on the state that neuron is in at the time of
pulse reception.
Here we have demonstrated that under certain condi-
tions, additiveandmultiplicativecouplingmaybeviewed
as two mathematically equivalent options for modeling.
In particular, the phase representation originally intro-
duced by Mirollo and Strogatz for additive coupling [5]
is readily modiﬁed to equally characterize dynamics of
pulse-coupled systems with multiplicative coupling. To
explicate the equivalence most clearly, we analyze a sim-
ple class of systems with instantaneous (delta-coupled)postsynaptic responses and homogeneous inhibitory cou-
pling. Weﬁndinparticularthatinhibitorymultiplicative
coupling can be transferred to additive coupling and vice
versa by simultaneously modifying the neuron potential,
that is, the free neuron dynamics, so that the resulting
spiking dynamics are identical. The coupling parameter
of the new coupling may be chosen freely, if the neu-
ron’s rise function is selected accordingly. We discuss
some peculiarities of the transformed neuron models in
detail, such as non-zero reset voltages, and suggest ap-
proximations to avoid these. The equivalence between
additive and multiplicative coupling holds also for inho-
mogeneous coupling as well as networked systems with
intricate interaction topology, if all coupling strengths
are transformed by the same mapping (for every receiv-
ing neuron).
To illustrate the range of applicability, we simulate two
diﬀerent collective phenomena both for models of addi-
tive and multiplicative coupling. The ﬁrst example sup-
portsk-winner-takes-all computations via symmetrically
all-to-all coupled neuron networks; the second topology-
dependent synchronization for inhibitory pulse coupling
with delays. The ﬁndings explicate that indeed exactly
the same collective dynamics can be generated by mod-
els with either type of coupling. Also, we exemplify that
slight manipulations of the transformed neuron poten-
tials can allow more eﬀective realization, often without
changing the resulting collective dynamics at all.
These results not only advance the theoretical founda-
tions for modeling spiking neural networks but may also
help transfering knowledge about systems with additive
to systems with multiplicative coupling and vice versa.
Such complementary results may in particular ease soft-
ware or hardware implementations of spiking neural net-
works for diﬀerent purposes.
