Abstract:
We study 4-dimensional SU(N)×U(1) gauge theories with a single massless Dirac
fermion in the 2-index symmetric/antisymmetric representations and show that they
are endowed with a noninvertible 0-form ˜Zχ

on a spatial three-torus T3, we construct the non-unitary gauge invariant operator
corresponding to ˜Zχ

noninvertible and the 1-form symmetries. The anomaly implies that all states in the
torus Hilbert space with the selected magnetic fluxes exhibit a two-fold degeneracy
for arbitrary T3size. The degenerate states are labeled by discrete electric fluxes and
are characterized by nonzero expectation values of condensates. In an Appendix, we

1 Introduction
Symmetries are the backbone of quantum field theory (QFT); the spectrum of local
and extended operators are organized in symmetry representations. The modern way
to define symmetry is via its action on topological surfaces. A p-form symmetry acts on
p-dimenstional objects and is generated by operators supported on p+1-codimensional
surfaces [1]. Traditionally, symmetries are connected to groups, and the operator that
generates the symmetry is unitary. However, recent developments have highlighted the
need to broaden the definition of symmetries to include actions generated by nonunitary
operators. These symmetries are noninvertible since the corresponding operators do
not have an inverse. Consequently, these operations do not form groups but can be
comprehended as categories, offering a new perspective on the nature of symmetries.
Noninvertible symmetries were first identified and applied in 2-dimensional QFT,
see, e.g., [2, 3]. The appreciation of the role of this new development in 4-dimensional
QFT resulted in an avalanche of works on this topic (a non-comprehensive list is [4–29]).
One significant development in the field is the recognition that 4-dimensional quan-
tum electrodynamics (QED) possesses a noninvertible symmetry [11, 12]. The idea is
that QED with a single Dirac fermion has a classical U(1)χchiral symmetry broken to
theZ2fermion number by the ABJ anomaly. The Noether current corresponding to
U(1)χis not conserved as it receives a contribution from the anomaly. However, one
may define a conserved chiral current by subtracting a Chern-Simons term that encodes
the anomaly. Next, an operator corresponding to U(1)χis constructed by exponentiat-
ing the modified current and integrating it on a 3-surface. This operator is not gauge
– 1 –invariant. However, dressing it with a TQFT makes it gauge invariant. The resulting
operator can be shown to generate a noninvertible symmetry for every rational value of
theU(1)χparameter. The construction in [11, 12] was further developed in [17, 18] by
showing that the definition of the noninvertible operator can be extended to any real
parameter of U(1)χby coupling the theory to a scalar field living on the 3-surface.
Comprehending this novel structure in gauge theories is important in pursuing
a deeper understanding of QFT. The present work examines SU(N)×U(1) gauge
theory with a single massless Dirac fermion in a representation R. The theory has a
classical U(1)χsymmetry broken by the ABJ anomaly in SU(N)- and U(1)-instanton
backgrounds. Does this theory exhibit noninvertible symmetries, and if so, can they
be utilized to establish exact nonperturbative statements? We demonstrate that the
answer to this query is affirmative.
Unlike QED, when our theory is put on a general manifold, the chiral symmetry
is reduced to Zχ
2gcd( TR,dR), where TRanddRare the Dynkin index and dimension of R.
Interestingly, we also show that the theory possesses a noninvertible ˜Zχ
2TRdiscrete chiral
symmetry, wherein Zχ
2gcd( TR,dR)is an invertible part.1We establish the noninvertibility
through a sequential process starting from the nonconservation of Noether’s current of
the chiral symmetry. Employing the Hamiltonian formalism and putting the theory on
a 3-dimensional spatial torus T3, we construct a noninvertible symmetry operator. This
setup provides a simple and explicit route to select the states on which the operator
˜Zχ
2TRacts nontrivially.
SU(N)×U(1) QCD-like theories are naturally endowed with an electric 1-form Z(1)
N
symmetry acting on the Wilson loops as well as a 1-form U(1)(1)
mmagnetic symmetry
that characterizes sectors with definite magnetic fluxes. Then, it is natural to ask
whether the theory exhibits a ’t Hooft anomaly as we perform a ˜Zχ
2TRtransformation
in the background of Z(1)
N. To address this question, for definiteness2we consider a
theory with fermions in the 2-index symmetric/anti-symmetric representation, which
possesses a ˜Zχ
2(N±2)noninvertible symmetry. We subject the theory to ZNtwists (2-
form background fields for Z(1)
N) along the non-trivial cycles of T3. In the presence of
theZNtwists, the noninvertible symmetry projects onto sectors in Hilbert space with
definite magnetic fluxes, easily identified in the Hamiltonian formalism. For Neven,
the algebra of ˜Zχ
2(N±2)andZ(1)
Nfails to commute by a Z2phase inside these sectors,
1Throughout this paper, we use a tilde to distinguish noninvertible symmetries and operators. Note
also that after gauging the vector U(1), the Z2part (fermion number) of ˜Zχ
2TRis part of the gauge
symmetry and not a global symmetry. With this in mind, we continue to denote the noninvertible
symmetry by ˜Zχ
2TR, as this subtlety does not affect our considerations of the anomaly and spectral
degeneracy.
2The conclusions of the work described can be generalized to fermions in higher representations.
– 2 –revealing a mixed anomaly between Z(1)
Nand˜Zχ
2(N±2)symmetries (anomalies involving
noninvertible symmetries have previously been considered in 1 + 1 dimensions, see [30–
35] and references therein). This anomaly implies that the states in these special sectors
must be 2-fold degenerate3on arbitrary size T3. Such degeneracies could be seen by
examining the condensates in realistic lattice simulations.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we demonstrate the origin of the
noninvertible symmetry by carefully examining SU(N)×U(1) QCD-like theories put
onT3with general flux backgrounds and build the noninvertible operator of ˜Zχ
2(N±2).
Then, we show that this symmetry has a ’t Hooft anomaly with the Z(1)
Nsymmetry. In
Section 3, we discuss the implication of this anomaly in the magnetic sectors selected by
˜Zχ
2(N±2)and exhibit the exact degeneracy. In the Appendix, we show the equivalence of
our operator construction to the “half-gauging” of a discrete subgroup of the magnetic
one form symmetry U(1)(1)
m, used in [11, 12] to construct a properly normalized defect
yielding consistent Euclidean correlation functions. We conclude with a brief discussion
in Section 4.
2 Noninvertible symmetries and their anomalies
Consider SU(N)×U(1) gauge theory with a single-flavor massless Dirac fermion in
a representation R. We use n,TR, and dRto denote the N-ality, Dynkin index, and
the dimension of R, respectively, and focus mostly on TR=N±2 for the two-index
symmetric (S)/antisymmetric (AS) representations of N-ality n= 2 and dimension
dR=N(N±1)
2for S/AS. Yet, our construction can be easily generalized to theories with
several flavors and fermions in higher representations. Classically, the theory is endowed
with a U(1)χglobal chiral symmetry. The fermion charges (both are left-handed Weyl)
under ( SU(N), U(1), U(1)χ) are
ψR∼(R,1,1), ψ ¯R∼(¯R,−1,1). (2.1)
The theory with the gauged U(1) has a Z(1)
N1-form electric symmetry, acting on both
SU(N) and U(1) Wilson loops, as well as a U(1)(1)
m1-form magnetic symmetry which
distinguishes the different U(1)-flux sectors.
We use Aandafor the 1-form gauge fields of SU(N) and U(1), respectively. The
corresponding field strengths are Fandf. The anomaly equation for the chiral U(1)χ
current is
∂µjµ
χ−2TR∂µKµ
SU(N)−2dR
8π2ϵµνλσ∂µaν∂λaσ= 0, (2.2)
3Similar to the exact finite-volume degeneracies due to invertible 0-form/1-form anomalies [36].
– 3 –where Kµ
SU(N)is the SU(N) topological current. Its normalization is such that the
integral of K0
SU(N)≡KCSover a three-dimensional manifold changes by an integer
under large gauge transformations. In other words, the operator
e−i2πR
T3d3x KCS(A)(2.3)
is invariant under large gauge transformations. This operator (which shifts the θ-angle
by 2π) will be important in what follows.
When the theory is defined on a spatial manifold with nontrivial 2-cycles, e.g.,
onT3, gauging U(1) breaks Zχ
2TRof the SU(N) theory further down to Zχ
2gcd( dR,TR).
The easiest way to see that is by compactifying the time direction, so we consider the
Euclidean version of the theory on T4. Under a chiral transformation, ( ψR, ψ¯R)→
eiα(ψR, ψ¯R), the measure changes by
exp [iα(2TRc2(F) + 2dRc2(f))], (2.4)
where c2(F)≡R
T4trF∧F
8π2∈Zandc2(f)≡R
T4f∧f
8π2∈Zare the second Chern classes
ofSU(N) and U(1). Then, demanding that the phase (2.4) is trivialized, and using
B´ ezout’s identity, which states that integers of the form az1+bz2are exact multiples
of gcd( a, b), we arrive at our conclusion.4For example, when gcd( dR, TR) = 1, there is
no residual chiral symmetry and the only symmetry left over is the Z2fermion number
symmetry which stays intact, assuming the Lorentz symmetry is unbroken.
It is important to emphasize that Zχ
2gcd( dR,TR)is a genuine invertible symmetry,
which is represented by a unitary operator acting on the Hilbert space of the theory.
What is the fate of Zχ
2TRthat is broken because of the U(1) instantons? Below, following
the approach of [17, 18], we argue that this symmetry becomes noninvertible. We shall
exhibit this and study the consequences using Hamiltonian quantization on T3in a
very explicit manner.
Consider the Hamiltonian quantization of the theory on a rectangular T3of sides
L1, L2, L3, in the A0=a0= 0 gauge. The Hilbert space is constructed in terms of
gauge fields A=Aidxianda=aidxi, where i= 1,2,3 is the spatial index (below, we
use ˆeito denote a unit vector in the i-th direction). We often use x, y, z forx1, x2, x3
when writing the components explicitly.
The physical Hilbert space is obtained from field-operator eigenstates after appro-
priate gauge averaging and imposing Gauss’s law; a detailed description can be found
4As a side note, there is no solution of self-dual BPST instanton on T4with unit topological charge
and zero twists [37]. Adding a twist removes the obstruction to the existence of the solution. These
twists are discussed below.
– 4 –in [36], see also the earlier works [38, 39]. The gauge fields obey boundary conditions
onT3
A(x+ ˆeiLi) = Γ iA(x)Γ−1
i,
a(x+ ˆeiLi) =a(x)−dωi(x), (2.5)
given in terms of SU(N) and U(1) transition functions, Γ iandωi, respectively [40]. We
work in a gauge where the SU(N) transition functions Γ iare constant unitary N×N
matrices [41]. The fermions obey similar boundary conditions (for brevity, we write
these for the N-ality two case, n= 2):
ψR(x+ ˆeiLi) = Ω i(x)ΓiψR(x) ΓT
i,
ψ¯R(x+ ˆeiLi) = Ω i(x)−1Γ∗
iψ¯R(x) Γ†
i. (2.6)
TheU(1) and SU(N) transition functions obey cocycle conditions assuring that the
fields satisfying (2.5, 2.6) are single-valued on the torus. The cocycle conditions obeyed
by the transition functions are
ΓiΓj=ei2π
NnijΓjΓi, nij=−nji, nij∈Z(mod N),
Ωi(x+ ˆejLj)Ωj(x) =e−i2πn

or
Ωi(x) =eiωi(x),with ωi=3X

Here, the (mod N) integers nijrepresent topological classes of 2-form Z(1)

fields in the respective 2-planes and mijlabel integer U(1)-flux sectors, distinguished
by their magnetic flux through the various 2-planes. The integer mijare charges under
the global magnetic U(1)(1)
m1-form symmetry [1]. It is easily seen that all gauge and
matter fields are single-valued on T3when (2.7) are obeyed. The integers nijandmij
label different flux sectors of the torus Hilbert space.
We next consider the global Z(1)
Nsymmetry [1]. The generators of the 1-form Z(1)
N
symmetry act on the transition functions. We label by tjandTjtheU(1) and SU(N)
group elements representing the action of the generators of Z(1)
Nin the j-th direction on
theU(1) and SU(N) transition functions, respectively. The action of Z(1)
Nis given by
Ωj→ti(x+ ˆejLj) Ωj(x)t−1

NδijΩj(x),

Ntransformations are represented by “improper” gauge transforma-
tions on the Hilbert space (in the first line, since both tjand Ω iare abelian, the Ω j’s
can be dropped).
The explicit expressions for U(1) and SU(N) group elements tj(x) and Tj(x) obey-
ing (2.9) and generating the center symmetry can be worked out. The explicit form
ofTj(x) can be found in the literature5. The explicit form of Tj(x) depends on both
the choice of gauge for the transition functions and on the nij2-form background (this
is because Tj(x) have nontrivial winding numbers for nij̸= 0 (mod N) [45]). We will
not need the expression for Tj, but only the commutation relation of the SU(N)Z(1)

Next, we construct the generator of the noninvertible chiral symmetry. To this
end, we integrate the anomaly equation (2.2) and use it to define a conserved (but not
gauge-invariant) U(1)χsymmetry operator on T3. Because of the boundary conditions
in the space directions for the U(1) fields, whose transition functions (2.8) necessarily
depend on xi, there are a-dependent boundary terms.6We find, denoting K0(a)≡

Next, we note that ∂0akis periodic on T3, while akitself obeys (2.5) with transition

The last line above indicates that there are two more terms obtained from the term on
the second line by cyclic rotation of x, y, z . Again, this is the operator Qχin the sector

Exponentiating (2.13), we find the (non-gauge-invariant) operator representing
Zχ
2TR:
X2TR=ei2π
2TRQχ. (2.14)
Let us now study the gauge transformation properties of X2TR. First, we note that
because of the gauge invariance of (2.3), the invariance of (2.14) under SU(N) (large and
small) gauge transformations is manifest. Next, consider U(1) gauge transformations
with periodic7eiλ:
ai→ai−∂iλ,with λ(x+ ˆeiLi) =λ(x) + 2πni. (2.15)
To study the transformation properties of (2.14) under U(1) transformations (2.15), we
note that, with λfrom (2.15), −2πR

replacing nj→ −n

along with two identical relations obtained by cyclic permutations of x, y, z .
Thus, combining the U(1) gauge transformations (2.18, 2.19), with the expression
forQχfrom (2.13), we find the transformation of X2TR
X2TR[a−dλ] =X2TR[a]e−i2πdR
TR[nx(myz+nnyz
N)+ny(mzx+nnzx
N)+nz(mxy+nnxy
N)],(2.20)
showing explicitly that the operator (2.14) is not U(1) gauge invariant.
Thus, following [17, 18], to make X2TRgauge invariant, we sum over nx, ny, nz,
obtaining the noninvertible ˜Zχ
2TRoperator

TR[nx(myz+nnyz

with Qχfrom (2.13). This equation shows that the operator is noninvertible and deter-
mines the sectors not annihilated by ˜X2TR. To see this, we use the Poisson resummation
formula

nx∈Ze−i2πdR
TR(myz+nnyz
N)nx=X

TR(myz+nnyz

. (2.22)
For˜X2TRto act nontrivially, i.e., not be set to zero, it must be that in each two-plane,
the fluxes mij, nij,i < j , have to obey
dR
TR(myz+nnyz
N) =lx, lx∈Z(plus cyclic) . (2.23)
It is easy to see that such integer-valued combinations of fluxes always exist (we shall
see examples below). In the Appendix, we construct the operator ˜X2TRusing the
“half-gauging” procedure of refs. [11, 12].
To summarize, here we have constructed a symmetry operator ˜X2TRof the non-
invertible chiral symmetry. The operator of the noninvertible symmetry acts as a
projection operator: it annihilates sectors of the torus Hilbert space whose fluxes do
not obey (2.23) and acts as unitary operator in each flux sector obeying (2.23).8
8In backgrounds with mij, nijchosen to yield integer li(2.23), the operator can simply be defined
by (2.14), since, as (2.20) shows, for such values of li, it is gauge invariant.
– 8 –We next study the commutator of the Z(1)
Ncenter symmetry transformation with
the noninvertible ˜X2TR. We denote the Z(1)
Ngenerator in the x-direction by Txtx(for
brevity omitting both hats over operators and the tensor product sign, with Tx,tx
obeying (2.9)). We use the commutation relation of (2.10) of Tiwith the operator (2.3),
as well the U(1) transformation law derived above, eqn. (2.20), with only nxnonzero
and with the integer nxreplaced by −n
N(as we reminded the reader in footnote 7). We
find

(2.24)
=˜X2TRe−i2π[nyz

Nlx],with lxfrom (2 .23).
Equation (2.24) and its two cyclically permuted versions, constitute our main result.
It shows that—provided both the phase on the r.h.s. is nontrivial and ˜X2TRis nonzero
(i.e. (2.23) holds)—there is a mixed anomaly between the Z(1)
Ncenter symmetry and
the noninvertible ˜Zχ
2TRchiral symmetry of the SU(N)×U(1) theory. As both operators
act nontrivially in the chosen integer- liT3Hilbert space, the algebra (2.24) will be seen
to imply exact degeneracies for any size T3.
In Section 3, we shall show that there are cases where both the phase in (2.24)
and ˜X2TRare nontrivial, i.e., (2.23) holds in the appropriate Hilbert space. As already
familiar from [36], this will be seen to imply degeneracies in the Hilbert space between
different “electric flux” states (eigenstates of Z(1)
N, i.e., of Txtx).
Before we continue with analyzing the implications of (2.24) for the finite-volume
spectrum, let us make a connection of (2.24) with the Euclidean path integral. We
denote the T3Hilbert space by Hli, with the understanding that U(1) (mij) andZ(1)
N
(nij) fluxes are chosen to yield an integer- li, so that ˜X2TRacts nontrivially. We now
define the Txtx-twisted partition function via the Hamiltonian formalism as a trace9
over states in Hliwith a Z(1)
Nx-direction generator inserted in the partition function,
i.e.Z ≡ trHlie−βHTxtx. Then, we use the fact that ˜X2TRacts as an invertible unitary
operator in Hli, as well as the commutation relation (2.24), to obtain

We conclude that the chiral symmetry ˜X2TRimplies that Z=e−i2π[nyz

that, if the phase is nontrivial, Zvanishes, unless fermion fields ( ψ¯RψR)kare inserted

9The relations we derive below hold also if we insert ( −1)Fin the partition function.
10Below, we show that the phase in (2.25) can take values at most in Z2, and that k=N±2

S/AS fermions, for the values of Nand choice of fluxes where the phase is nontrivial.
– 9 –that the twisted partition function (2.25) sums over SU(N) and U(1) gauge fields
which obey the boundary conditions (2.5) in the T3spatial directions, determined by
nijandmij. The boundary conditions in the Euclidean time direction (of extent β)
are twisted, by the insertion of Tx, leading to a nontrivial SU(N) twist nx4= 1 in
thex-time plane. Thus, the twisted partition function (2.25) sums over SU(N) field
configurations with topological charges −n14nyz

3 Hilbert space, magnetic sectors, and the 2-fold degeneracy
Here, we analyze the consequences of condition (2.23) and the algebra of (2.24). Con-
dition (2.23) selects sectors in Hilbert space with definite U(1) magnetic fluxes in the
2-3, 3-1, and 1-2 planes proportional to the integers lx, ly, lz, respectively. In the fol-
lowing, we always set ly=lz= 0 (with nxy=mxy=nzx=mzx= 0) to reduce
complexity and examine the theory for various values of lx=dR
TR(myz+nnyz
N). We
also choose nyz∈ {0,1,2, ..., N −1}. Since we are mainly concerned with symmetric
(S)/antisymmetric (AS) fermions, we set the N-ality n= 2.
We start with sectors with a vanishing magnetic flux, i.e., we set lx= 0, which
translates into myz+2
Nnyz= 0. When Nis odd, the only solution is the null solution
myz=nyz= 0. This yields a trivial phase in the algebra of (2.24). However, when
N= 2Mis even, there are two solutions. First, the null one myz=nyz= 0, giving a
trivial phase in (2.24). The second is the new solution (we denote the phase in (2.24)
bye−iα=e−2πi(nyz
N−2
Nlx)):
S/AS : N= 2M, n yz=M, m yz=−1, lx= 0, α=π. (3.1)
TheZ2phase in (2.24) implies that some electric flux states in a sector with a 0-
magnetic flux are 2-fold degenerate.
Numerical tests reveal that this pattern continues in sectors with nonzero magnetic
flux, lx̸= 0. First, when Nis odd, all allowed sectors have a trivial phase in the
algebra of (2.24), indicating no kinematical constraints in these theories. For Neven,
N= 2M, one can use lx=dR
TR(myz+nnyz
N) to see that there exists integers myz∈Z
– 10 –andnyz∈ {0,1,2, ..., N −1}that satisfy the relation
M(2M±1)(Mm yz+nyz) = 2 M(M±1)lx, (3.2)
for S/AS fermions, respectively. Sectors with definite myzandnyzthat satisfy (3.2)
will also yield at most a Z2phase in the algebra (2.24), if they additionally satisfy
M2(nyz+ (2M±1)myz)∈M2(M±1)(2Z+ 1). (3.3)
TheZ2phase implies that the states in these sectors have double-fold degeneracy.
Let us flesh this out in detail. For definiteness, we consider S/AS fermions, which
yield a nontrivial phase in (2.24) as well as involve only a minimal SU(N) ’t Hooft
twist, nyz= 1 (as opposed to the lx= 0 solutions (3.1), which must have nyz=N/2 to
produce an anomaly). For both S/AS fermions, these minimal-twist solutions, yielding
an integer lxand a Z2phase in (2.24), must have N= 4p+ 2. Using again e−iα=
e−2πi(nyz
N−2
Nlx), examples of myzthat give the Z2phase are:
S :N= 4p+ 2, nyz= 1, m yz=−2p−1, lx=−p(3 + 4 p), α= 2π(1
2+ 2p),
AS : N= 4p+ 2, nyz= 1, m yz=−2p−1, lx=−(1 +p)(1 + 4 p), α= 2π(3
2+ 2p).
(3.4)
Thus, we now focus on the flux backgrounds (3.4), enumerate the degenerate “elec-
tric flux” sectors11in the corresponding Hilbert spaces Hlx,ly=lz=0, and discuss some
of their properties. The transition functions for SU(N) and U(1) obeying the cocycle
conditions with nyz, myzgiven in (3.4) are
Γx= 1,Γy=P,Γz=Q,where PQ=ei2π

ωx= 1, ωy=−πz

The center symmetry generators for SU(N) and U(1), obeying (2.9), can be taken to

smallT2∈T3, with the T2spanning the y, zdirections [48, 49]) by focusing on the lowest energy
states. We shall not do this here in complete detail, but see Footnote 13.

Since Txtxis a symmetry, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian can be labeled by its eigenval-
ues,Txtx|E, e x⟩=|E, e x⟩ei2π
Nex, with ex∈Z(mod N). On the other hand, the algebra
(2.24), Txtx˜X2TR(Txtx)−1=−˜X2TR, implies that, in Hlx,ly=lz=0, with lxfrom (3.4),
˜X2TR|E, e x⟩Hlx,ly=lz=0∼ |E, e x+N

Thus, ˜X2TRmaps an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian of energy Eand flux exto another
eigenstate of the same energy, but with flux ex+N
2(mod N) (hence, a Txtxeigenvalue
differing by eiπ, as per (2.24); we also note that the phase in the action of ˜Xalso
depends on whether the state is bosonic of fermionic).13
To further characterize the degenerate flux states, we will show that the degenerate
states (3.7) have nonvanishing expectation values of a condensate, which we write
schematically as ( ψ¯RψR)N±2
2. These expectation values take opposite values in the two
degenerate flux states. To this end, we now go back to our twisted partition function
(2.25). Since in Hlx,ly=lz=0the phase is in Z2, in order to obtain a nonzero phase we
12ForSU(N), these are the ones from [47]. Briefly, we remind the reader that Txcannot be taken
to be constant, since, as already discussed, a twist of the partition function in the time direction by
Tx, recall (2.25), leads to fractional topological charge on the T4, equal to1
N+ integer. This implies
thatTxhas fractional winding number [45], as a map from T3to the gauge group, with its N-th power
being a large gauge transformation. Thus, on physical states Txobeys TN
x= 1. Explicit expressions
forT1can be found in the literature (see [42, 43] for SU(2) and [44] for SU(N)) but are not needed
here.
13As promised, on a small T3, the lowest flux states can be worked out classically. For the bosonic
backgrounds, the lowest-energy gauge field backgrounds are
A(l)=−iTl
1dT−l
1, l= 0, ..., N −1,
a(l)=4πp(p+ 1)
L3L2(2p+ 1)(ydz−zdy) +2πl
(2p+ 1)L1dx . (3.8)
The fundamental SU(N) winding Wilson loops then take values Wy=Wz= 0, Wx=ei2π
Nl. Using
the backgrounds (3.8), solving for the fermions, imposing Gauss’s law, and averaging over gauge
transformations, one can construct the Nclassically-degenerate states in Hlx,ly=lz=0. It is already
clear from (3.8) that these Nstates are obtained by the action of Txtxfrom each other. The electric
flux states from eqn. (3.7) are a discrete Fourier transform thereof. The anomaly implies that the N-
fold degeneracy will be lifted and that only the pairwise degeneracy will remain quantum mechanically.
Extending this small-torus explicit analysis further, along the lines of [48, 49], as well as similar studies
for other backgrounds, e.g., (3.1), are left for the future.

Next, recall that ˜X†
2TR˜X2TR= 1 in Hli, remembering that we are in a definite magnetic
flux sector, where the chiral symmetry operator ˜X2TRacts in an invertible manner, and
using (3.7), we find that gauge-invariant condensates obey

N±2k⟨E, e 1+N
2|(ψ¯RψR)k|E, e 1+N

In particular, (3.10) shows that the condensate appearing in (3.9) takes opposite
values in the degenerate states. In the twisted partition function (3.9), this minus sign
is cancelled by change of the phase ei2π
Ne1(from the action of Txtx). Thus, we can
restrict the evaluation of (3.9) by summing over half the e1sectors:

These nonzero expectation values can be computed semiclassically at a small torus and
shown not to vanish, similar to [50].
To summarize, above we constructed the doubly-degenerate states using the back-
ground (3.4), in the N= 4p+2 theory, as an example. However, based on the Z2-valued
anomaly, similar descriptions involving degenerate states with opposite values of the
relevant condensate hold in all even- Ncases. In particular, the doubly-degenerate flux
states corresponding to (3.1) can also be explicitly worked out.
Before we discuss these cases, let us contrast the findings in the SU(N)×U(1)
theory on T3with those in the SU(N) theory, also on T3. Consider the SU(4p+ 2)
theory (i.e., with even Nnot divisible by 4). It has a Z(1)
2center symmetry and an
invertible discrete chiral symmetry Zχ
2(N±2). These have a Z2-valued mixed anomaly in
appropriate Z(1)
2backgrounds on T3. This anomaly implies, as in [36], an exact two-fold
degeneracy in the twisted Hilbert space of the SU(4p+ 2) theory, on any torus size.
This is similar to the degeneracy of the SU(4p+2)×U(1) theory on T3discussed in this
paper. We stress, however, that the latter theory has gcd( dR, TR) = 1, and hence no
genuine chiral symmetry. The degeneracy we found is, thus, due to the noninvertible
chiral ˜Zχ
2TRsymmetry.
– 13 –Consider now the case when Nis divisible by 4. In the SU(N) theory this mixed
anomaly is trivial on T3and hence one cannot use the Z(1)
21-form symmetry to argue
for an exact degeneracy on a finite-size torus. In the SU(N)×U(1) theory, however,
for any even N, we showed that there is an anomaly between the Z(1)
Ncenter and
noninvertible chiral symmetries in the (3.1) background, leading to an exact two-fold
degeneracy at any size T3.
The case of minimal dimension condensate occurs if we take N= 4 and an anti-
symmetric tensor. Here, the anomaly predicts equal and opposite values of the bilinear
fermion condensate ψ¯RψRin the two states that are degenerate at any finite volume,
in the appropriately twisted background. Since the degeneracy is present at any finite
volume, should the condensate remain nonzero in the infinite volume limit, this predicts
theZ4→Z2(noninvertible) chiral symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit.
We stress that the use of appropriate twists—the mij, nijwith integer li, i.e. the
ones that reveal the anomaly—at finite volume is simply a tool to probe the gauge
dynamics. At least in the theory with a nonzero mass gap, the infinite volume limit is
expected to be independent of the boundary conditions and the degeneracies revealed
are expected to persist in the thermodynamic limit.
4 Discussion
Here, we found that the anomaly establishes the 2-fold degeneracy on arbitrary-size T3.
Yet, one eventually wants to see what happens as we take the thermodynamic limit by
sending the volume of T3to infinity.
To speculate on what could happen in SU(N)×U(1) theory, let us again return to
its cousin, the SU(N) gauge theory with S/AS fermions. The latter has a global U(1)
baryon number and U(1)χchiral symmetry. As usual, quantum effects break U(1)χ
down to, now, the invertible Zχ
2(N±2). The 0-form faithful global symmetry of this theory
isU(1)
ZN
p×Zχ
2(N±2), with p= gcd( N,2). The fact that the quotient group is nontrivial
means that we can activate a ’t Hooft flux in the center of SU(N) accompanied by
a flux in U(1) such that the cocycle conditions are always obeyed on general four-
dimensional manifolds. The authors constructed these fluxes in vector-like theories,
dubbed as the baryon-color (BC) fluxes, in [51, 52] (also see [53–57] for applications,
and [58] for the construction and applications of these fluxes in chiral gauge theories).
The partition function acquires a ZN±2phase as we apply a Zχ
2(N±2)rotation in the
background of the BC flux. This phase was interpreted as an anomaly of Zχ
2(N±2)in
the BC background. Assuming that the theory has a mass gap and forms hadrons in
the IR, the anomaly is interpreted to imply the existence of N±2 degenerate vacua
– 14 –[53]. One expects to see this degeneracy emerge on a finite-volume manifold (larger
than the inverse strong-scale) and persist in the thermodynamic limit.
As we argued in this work, gauging the U(1) baryon symmetry endows the theory
with a Z2anomaly phase when Nis even, implying that at any finite volume there
is exact 2-fold degeneracy. Thus, 2 degenerate vacua are guaranteed to survive the
infinite volume limit. If the SU(N)×U(1) theory also has N±2 degenerate vacua
in the infinite volume limit (as the SU(N) theory is believed to) the exact N±2-fold
degeneracy should be revealed in the thermodynamic limit.
One might, of course, wonder whether a stronger phase (and stronger constraints,
as in [59]) can be exhibited if we subject the SU(N)×U(1) theory to a gravitational
background. In other words, it would be interesting to investigate whether there is
a mixed anomaly between the noninvertible ˜Zχ
2(N±2)and gravity. If the gravitational
anomaly does not produce a stronger phase beyond Z2, the implications in the ther-
modynamic limit of the SU(N)×U(1) theory are of interest. By weakly gauging U(1)
in the SU(N) theory, one anticipates the presence of N±2 nearly degenerate vacua.
However, the dynamics of the U(1) gauge field may affect the precise degeneracy. This
intriguing investigation remains open for future study.
Finally, we comment on the SU(N)×U(1) theory at finite temperature. The
presence of the identified mixed anomaly implies that it is necessary for either the 1-form
symmetry Z(1)
N, the 0-form symmetry ˜Zχ
2(N±2), or both symmetries to be broken [60–62].
Actually, since Z(1)
Nacts on the U(1) Wilson lines, we expect it to be broken at zero
and finite temperature. Consequently, the anomaly is consistently matched, leading us
to only expect the restoration of the broken ˜Zχ
2(N±2)symmetry and the breaking of the
Z(1)
2subgroup of the 1-form symmetry for even- Nat some finite temperature.

A The noninvertible defect via “half-gauging” of Z(1)
TR⊂U(1)(1)
m
Here, we consider the construction of the noninvertible defect for14˜Zχ
2TRusing the “half-
gauging” procedure of refs. [11, 12] instead of the sum over gauge orbits of [17, 18].
14Once again, we acknowledge our abuse of notation: as per the remark of Footnote 1, the Z2
fermion number subgroup of Zχ
2TRis part of the U(1) gauge group.
– 15 –The advantage of the former construction is that it gives rise to well-defined Euclidean
correlation functions involving the noninvertible defect, considered more generally than
as an operator inserted at a particular time. In particular, this allows inserting the
defect at a particular location in space, giving rise to well-defined Hilbert spaces twisted
by the noninvertible symmetry.
Our discussion below makes use of the techniques described explicitly in ref. [11]
and is restricted to the case gcd( dR, TR) = 1. For our SU(N)×U(1) theories with a
two-index S/AS Dirac fermion, this is the case of even- Nnot divisible by 4, leaving the
generalization to the more general case for future work (although a generalization to
gcd(dR, TR)>1 should be possible [11]). In order to define the defect, we consider the
gauging of the Z(1)
TRsubgroup of the magnetic U(1)(1)
m1-form symmetry. As shown in
[11], this gauging produces the same theory but with a discrete shift of the U(1) theta
angle θ→θ−2πdR
TR. This shift, as per our Eqn. (2.4), is undone by a Z2TRchiral rotation
of the fermions ( ψR, ψ¯R). We conclude that the SU(N)×U(1) theory is invariant under
the above gauging of Z(1)
TR⊂U(1)(1)
m.
As in [11, 12], the upshot of the half-gauging procedure is to define a defect, re-
placing our eqn. (2.21) for the operator ˜X2TRby the following object, which we label,
for brevity, by the same letter

where, as in the main text, ais the dynamical U(1) gauge field and Ais the SU(N)
gauge field with KCS[A] entering as in (2.3).
The 3d defect TQFT ATR,dR[da
TR] is defined via an integral over a 4d bulk with a
boundary, which is here taken to be the t= 0 plane:

(A.2)
The fields ( b(2), c(1)) define the 2-form ZTRgauge field (used in the half-gauging pro-
cedure) and obeying the Dirichlet boundary condition b(2)= 0 at t= 0, and kis
the modular inverse of dR, i.e. kdR= 1 (mod TR). Defining the defect via the “half-
gauging” procedure replaces the sum over gauge copies of the gauge noninvariant U(1)
Chern-Simons term by the TQFT ATR,dR[da
TR] and produces a well defined Euclidean
defect.
TheATR,dR[da
TR] theory has a Z(1)

the partition function eR

which implies, together with the gauge invariance of ATR,dR[da

da= 2πZ. This is precisely the condition (2.23) of the main text, in the
absence of an electric Z(1)
Ncenter symmetry background. Thus, we have succeeded in
defining a noninvertible defect associated with the ˜Zχ
2TRchiral symmetry.
The question left open, then, is to show that the definition of ˜X2TRfrom (A.1)
reproduces the mixed anomaly with center symmetry exhibited in Eqn. (2.24). This
would necessitate generalizing the half-gauging procedure to backgrounds with frac-
tionalH
da∈2πZ
N.15In the language of defects, one has to consider defects associated
with the (invertible) electric Z(1)
N1-form symmetry of the SU(N)×U(1) theory and de-
termine the fusion rules of these codimension-two defects with the noninvertible defect
defined by (A.1). The fusion rules of ˜X2TRwith these codimension-two Z(1)
N-defects of
two different orientations are relevant to the anomaly (2.24). The first are “perpendic-
ular” to ˜X2TR, with a worldvolume in the x-tplane and in the language of this paper
correspond to the turning on of nyzfrom (2.24). The other type of codimension-two
defects implementing the Z(1)
Nsymmetry are “parallel” to ˜X2TR, with world volume in
they-zplane,16implementing the one-form symmetry transformation with parameter
nx=−n
Ndue to Txtxof (2.24). The careful study of the various defects mentioned
should make finding these fusion rules possible, but we leave this interesting ques-
tion to future studies. We believe, however, that the T4path-integral discussion after
Eqn. (2.25) gives strong support for our finding (2.24)—while, admittedly, leaving the
study of the more general interesting situations mentioned above open.
