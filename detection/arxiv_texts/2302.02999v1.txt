Abstract : In this work, in the framework of dynamical system analysis, we fo cus
on the study of the accelerated expansion of the Universe of f(Q) gravity theory where
Qbe the non-metricity that describes the gravitational interaction . We consider the
linear form of f(Q) gravity i.e. f(Q) =−α1Q−α2whereα1andα2are constants. We
consider an interaction between dark matter (DM) and dark energ y (DE) in f(Q) gravity.
To reduce the modiﬁed Friedmann equations to an autonomous syst em of ﬁrst-order
ordinary diﬀerential equations, we introduce some dimensionless ne w variables. The
nature of the critical points are discussed by ﬁnding the eigenvalue s of the Jacobian
matrix. We get six critical points for interacting DE model. We also ana lyze the density
parameter, equation of state (EoS) parameter and deceleration parameter and draw their
plots and we conclude that for some suitable range of the paramete rsλandα, the value
of the deceleration parameter is q=−1 which shows that the expansion of Universe is
accelerating and the value of EoS parameter is ωφ=−1 which shows that the model
is ΛCDM model. Finally, we discussed the classical as well as quantum st ability of the
model.
Keywords :f(Q) gravity theory, interaction between DM and DE, dynamical syste m

I. Introduction
The observations through the Supernova Type Ia (SNeIa) and Hu bble diagram [1, 2]
shows that the expansion of the present Universe is accelerated w hich has been conﬁrmed
by the valid range of data from recent SNeIa data to Baryon Acous tic Oscillations
(BAOs) and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) [3–7]. Th e expansion of
Universe is accelerating because the matter existing in the Universe are aﬀected by an
exotic forms of energy. This energy is known as dark energy (DE). From latest CMBR
data, our Universe contains 4% ordinary baryonic matter, 20% dar k matter and 76%
dark energy. In the right hand side of Einstein ﬁeld equations, some components such
as scalar ﬁeld, cosmological constant etc. are present which get a negative equation of
state parameter ( ωφ). The form of the equation of state (EoS) parameter is ωφ=pφ
ρφ. If
the value of EoS parameter ωφnear to−1, then it represents to the standard cosmology.
Ifωφ= 1 then it represents the stiﬀ ﬂuid, if ωφ= 0 then the phase of the Universe is
1matter dominant while for ωφ=1
3, the phase of the Universe is radiation dominant. If
the EoS parameter lies in between −1 to 0,i.e.−1< ωφ<0 then the Universe is in
quintessence phase, also for phantom dark energy model ωφ<−1 and lastly ωφ=−1
represents the cosmological constant i.e.ΛCDM model.
However, the inexorable aﬄuence of observational proofs of cos mic speed up does not
satisfy with the standard cosmology in the theory of General Relat ivity (GR). To solve
this problem, cosmologists introduced a new element in the form of ne gative pressure
but it rises so many questions on its behaviour and it introduced some new problems
which is hard to solve. So it may be assumed that these observationa l proofs may be the
ﬁrst breakthrough of the laws of gravity on cosmological scale. Fr om these observational
evidences many modiﬁed gravity theories have been exhibited and f(R) gravity theory
is one of the most used modiﬁed gravity theory where Ris the Ricci scalar [8]. In f(R)
gravity theory the scalar curvature Ris replaced by a function f(R) in the gravity
Lagrangian.The other most used modiﬁed gravity theories are: f(T) gravity ( Tis Torsion
scalar) [9], f(G) gravity ( Gis Gauss Bonnet scalar), f(R,T) gravity (R is Ricci scalar
andTis the stress energy-momentum tensor). From Riemannian geomet ry, GR can be
expressed in terms of the Levi-Civita connection. In this process t he geometry is free
from torsion and non-metricity. Afterward the Riemannian geomet ry, GR can also be
expressed in forms of some other geometries, one of them is called t eleparallel gravity. In
this way, the gravitational force is guided by the torsion Tinstead of the curvature Rin
Riemannian geometry. Another way may be the non-metricity metho d, where the non-
metricity Qtreats the gravitational interaction and it is free from torsion and curvature
which is known as symmetric teleparallel gravity. In current days, a new modiﬁed gravity
theory has attracted the interest of researchers is called symme tric teleparallel gravity
(ST) or f(Q) gravity, where Qis the non-metricity term which is free from torsion
and curvature [10]. This theory is the generalization of Riemannian ge ometry which is
described by Weyl’s geometry [11]. In ﬂat space, the f(Q) gravity is equivalent to GR. It
is important that the f(Q) gravity theory issame as the f(T)gravity theory. The gravita-
tional ﬁeld equations of f(Q) gravity are second-order while f(R) gravity has forth-order
ﬁeldequations. This theoryismoreattractedbecause theﬁeldequ ations areeasy tosolve.
In our work, we consider a isotropic and homogeneous Universe whic h contains dark
matter, dark energy and baryonic matter. The dark matter is in th e shape of dust and
dark energy is expressed by scalar ﬁeld and baryons ﬁeld are expre ssed by perfect ﬂuid.
Scalar ﬁeld can also be considered as a perfect ﬂuid. In the Universe , the matter is
considered as a dust and two perfect ﬂuids. All these three ﬂuids in teract to each other
and minimally coupled to gravity [12]. From the last few years, the mod els based on
interaction between the dark energy and dark matter or any othe r external components
have attracted great inspirations. This type of interacting DE mod els can successfully
explained the cosmological problems such as phantom crossing, cos mic coincidence and
cosmic age problem [13–17]. In our present work, we discussed the in teracting DE in f(Q)
gravity. In present days the interaction between dark energy an d dark matter may be a
2major issue to be encountered in studying the physics of DE. The be haviour of these two
components are still unknown and for this reason to derive the exa ct form of interaction
from the ﬁrst principles may not be possible. In ﬁeld theory, it is ordin ary to consider the
invertible interaction between these two dark components. A perf ect interaction may be
given by a mechanism to reduce the coincidence cosmological problem . Moreover, some
observational evidences of this interacting dark energy model ha s been obtained from the
expansion history of the Universe by using WMAP, SNIa,BAO and SDSS data as well as
the progress of cosmic structure. Lastly, the interaction betwe en the dark matter and
dark energy in the continuity equations must be a function of the en ergy densities by a
quantity whose dimension is inverse of time and Hubble parameter is th e obvious choice
for interaction.
We discussed the dynamical system analysis of scalar ﬁeld in f(Q) gravity. One of
the major issues in theories of gravity is to ﬁnd the analytical or num erical solutions
due to the complicated ﬁeld equations [18–20]. Some nonlinear terms a re present in
Einstein’s Field equations which are not easy to solve and hence compa rison to the
observations cannot be easy one. To solve the Einstein’s equations , some other methods
are required and dynamical system analysis is one of such method wh ich is capable to
solve the nonlinear terms in Einstein’s equations. Dynamical system is used to ﬁnd
the numerical solutions and understand the stability behaviour of a given system. In
dynamical system, the most important thing is to ﬁnd the critical po ints from the set
of autonomous ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equations which a re obtained from the
Einstein’s equations. The stability analysis of a model are obtained by calculating
the Jacobian matrix at each critical points and ﬁnding the eigenvalue s from Jacobian
matrix. This is the process to analyze the stability behaviour of any m odel near a criti-
calpoint. Wealsoanalyzetheclassical aswell asquantumstabilityof f(Q)gravitytheory.
In this paper, our main motive is to discuss the late time acceleration o ff(Q) gravity
theory with a linear form f(Q) =−α1Q−α2, whereα1andα2are constants with the
analysis of the stability behaviour of this model by applying dynamical system approach.
This paper is systematized as: In Sec. II, we present the theory o ff(Q) gravity. In Sec.
III, we introduce some new variables from Einstein’s equations and a pply dynamical
system analysis. In Sec. IV, we ﬁnd the critical points of the dynam ical system and
discuss the stability analysis by using the phase plots. In this part we ﬁnd the value of
density parameters, EoS parameter, deceleration parameter an d draw their plots. In Sec.
V, we analyze classical and quantum stability of these critical points . In Sec. VI, we
compare our obtained values with the observational values and pro vide a conclusion.

In diﬀerential geometry, the metric tensor gµνis the generalization of gravitational poten-
tial. It is mainly used to determine angles, distances and volumes wher easYµνrepresents
3the covariant derivative and parallel transport [18]. According to [19], the aﬃne connec-
tion may be split into the following two independent components: the C hristoﬀel symbol

FLRW metric in Cartesian co-ordinates is given by

III. Dynamical System Analysis in f(Q)gravity
The main objective to study the dynamical system, specially of non- linear equations is to
determine the stability conditions of the ﬁxed points or equilibrium poin ts. Dynamical
system analysis is most useful technique to study cosmological beh aviour of the Universe,
where we could not ﬁnd the exact solution due to the complicated sys tems [23]. The
dynamical systems are mostly used in cosmological models for non-lin ear systems of dif-
ferential equations. A dynamical system is generally written as [24], ˙x=f(x), where the
function f:X→Xand the over dot denotes the derivative with respect to the time
t∈Randx= (x1,x2,x3,....,x n)∈Xto be an element of the phase space X⊆Rn. The
function fis seen as a vector ﬁeld of Rnsuch that f(x) = (f1(x),f2(x),....,fn(x)). This
shows that we have nequations which analyze the stability behaviour of nvariables. The
equation ˙ x=f(x) saidthat therateofchangedx
dtofthe function x(t) withsome condition.
The condition is: if the current value is x, then the rate of change is f(x). This equation is
known as ordinary diﬀerential equation. The diﬀerential equation is called autonomous if
the condition doesn’t depend upon time t, it only depends about the current value of the
variablex. The autonomous equation ˙ x=f(x) is said to have a critical point at x=x0if
and only if f(x0) = 0 [25]. We now analyze the stability behaviour of critical points. The
critical point x0is called stable critical point if for every ǫ >0∃aδsuch that if φ(t) is any
solution of ˙ x=f(x) satisfying /ba∇dblφ(t0)−x0/ba∇dbl< δ, then the solution φ(t) exists∀t≥t0and
it satisﬁes /ba∇dblφ(t)−x0/ba∇dbl< ǫ∀t≥t0. The critical point x0is called asymptotically stable
if∃a number δsuch that if φ(t) be any solution of ˙ x=f(x) satisfying /ba∇dblφ(t0)−x0/ba∇dbl< δ
then lim t→∞φ(t) =x0[26]. The minimal distinction between above two deﬁnitions is
that near an asymptotically critical point all trajectories reach at that point, while near a
stable critical point all trajectories made a circle near at that point [27]. In cosmology all
stable critical points aretreated asasymptotically stable critical p oint. The critical points
5which are not stable is called unstable critical points i.e.the trajectories starting near
the critical points and escape away from it. Now we introduce some a pproaches which
can be used to understand the stability criteria of critical points. L inear stability theory
is the most useful process to analyze the physical properties of c osmological models [28].
Linear stability theory is used to linearize the system near the critica l point for studying
the dynamical properties near this point. Let x0be a critical point of the system ˙ x=
f(x). We linearize the system around the critical points by Taylor’s expa nsion where each
component of the vector ﬁeld f(x) = (f1(x),f2(x),...,fn(x)) such that
fi(x) =fi(x0)+n/summationdisplay
j=1∂fi
∂xj(x0)yj+1
2!n/summationdisplay
j,k=1∂2fi
∂xj∂xk(x0)yjyk+....... (13)
whereyis deﬁned by y=x−x0. Now we neglect the second order or above derivative
terms and deﬁne the Jacobian matrix as
J=∂fi
∂xj=
∂f1
∂x1∂f1
∂x2···∂f1
∂xn...··· ···...
∂fn
∂x1∂fn
∂x2···∂fn
∂xn
, (14)
This matrixisknown asstability matrix. The eigenvalues areevaluated fromtheJacobian
matrixJat the critical point x0to determine the stability of the system. Let x=x0∈
X⊆Rnbe a critical point of the system ˙ x=f(x). If eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix
J(x0) have non zero real part, then the critical point x0is called hyperbolic critical point.
Otherwise the point x0is called non-hyperbolic critical point. Linear stability theory
fails for non-hyperbolic critical points then other methods should b e used to solve non-
hyperbolic critical points. If all the eigenvalues of Jacobian matrix h ave positive real
parts and trajectories are repelled from the critical point then th e critical point x0is
called unstable point or repeller. If all the eigenvalues have negative real parts and the
point attracts all near by trajectories then the critical point x0is called stable as well as
attractor. If two eigenvalues both are opposite in signs with real p art, then the critical
pointx0is called saddle point, which attracts trajectories in some directions and repels
along other directions. To understand the stability behaviour of th ese type of critical
points, we need a better methods other than the linear stability ana lysis such as Center
manifold theory, perturbation function, Lyapunov stability.
Inf(Q) gravity theory, we consider homogeneous, isotropic and ﬂat FRW metric as per
the model of our universe and the energy density ρm. Both interact with the dark energy
which is taken as a minimally coupled scalar ﬁeld φandV(φ) be the self-interacting
potential [29]. So the pressure and energy density for this scalar ﬁ eld are
ρφ=1
2˙φ2+V(φ), pφ=1
2˙φ2−V(φ). (15)
Then the modiﬁed Friedmann equations of f(Q) gravity are given as
H2=1

ρφ+ρm+f
2/bracketrightbigg
, (16)
6˙H=−1
2/bracketleftbiggρm+ρφ+pφ
12fQQH2+fQ/bracketrightbigg
. (17)
The energy equations are
˙ρm+3Hρm= 0,˙ρφ+3H(1+ωφ)ρφ= 0. (18)
Now we consider a minimally coupled scalar ﬁeld ( φ) which is represented by the equation
of motion
¨φ+3H˙φ+dV(φ)
dφ= 0 (19)
where the over dot denotes the derivative with respect to time t. This equation is also
called modiﬁed Klein-Gordon equations. Due to complicated form of eq uation (19), it is
not possible to ﬁnd analytic solution, so to understand the cosmolog ical behaviour, we
need to put the equation (19) into an autonomous system. The bet ter way to discuss the
stability of solutions are to introduce the new variables. For expone ntial potential, this
type of transformation is useful, because it transforms the set o f non-trivial solutions to
the critical points of the autonomous system of equations [30]. Due to this reason, we
introduce the new dimensionless variables
x=˙φ√

V(φ)√
3H,Ωm=ρm
3H2(20)
Here, Ω mbe the density parameter for dark matter. Apply the variables of e quation
(20) in the equations (16 -17), then the equations are reduced to the set of autonomous
ordinary diﬀerential equations

where we assume V(φ) =eλφsuch thatV′(φ)
V(φ)=λ, a constant and the independent variable
N=logadenotes the logarithmic time with respect to the scale factor a. To obtain the
critical points ﬁrst, equating the system of equations (21)-(23) equal to zero and discuss
the stability of the critical points. We assume a simplest linear functio nal form of f(Q)
gravity such as f(Q) =−α1Q−α2, whereα1andα2are constants. [31]. If we consider
α1= 1 and α2= 0 then the above model reduced to f(Q) =−Qwhich is identical
to General Relativity in ﬂat space [32]. To derive the autonomous sys tem of ordinary
diﬀerential equations (21 - 22) we use f(Q) =−α1Q−α2. Now using the dimensionless
variables in the modiﬁed Friedmann equation (16), we ﬁnd the density parameter as
Ωm= 1−x2−y2. (24)
7For the energy condition the density parameter Ω mlies between 0 and 1 i.e.0<Ωm<1,
for ﬁx Ω m, (x,y) lies on the circle x2+y2= 1−Ωm. The phase space ( x,y,Ωm) of
the autonomous system of diﬀerential equations (21)-(23) form s a paraboloid ( x2+y2+
Ωm= 1) which is bounded by Ω m= 0 and Ω m= 1. This condition represents that the
phase plane is ﬁnite. The cosmological parameters corresponding t o the scalar ﬁeld are
the equation of state parameter ( ωφ), the density parameter (Ω φ) and the deceleration
parameter ( q) obtained by the new introduced dimensionless variables as follows
ωφ=pφ
ρφ=x2−y2
x2+y2,Ωφ=ρφ
3H2=x2+y2(25)
and
ωTot=p
ρ=pφ
ρφ+ρm=x2−y2
x2+y2+Ωm=x2−y2(by using Ωm= 1−x2−y2) (26)
The Friedmann equations (16)-(17) and the variables in equation (2 0) will give

So the deceleration parameter is

H2=−1−3

IV. Critical Points and Stability Analysis
We explore the stability behaviour of the above autonomous system of equations at each
critical points. In the study of dynamical analysis, the phase spac e is an very important
tool. In this paper, we draw the phase plots accordingly which indicat es the stability of
the models. To draw the phase plots we need to ﬁnd the critical point s of the autonomous
system of equations (21)-(23). For ﬁnding critical points ﬁrst we have to solve x′= 0,
y′= 0 and Ω m= 0. The system of equations (21)-(23) has the following four critic al
points:
(I) Critical Points: P1,P2= (±1,0,0),
(II) Critical Points: P3,P4= (−λ√

dφ. The critical points and the corresponding
cosmological parameters at these critical points have been prese nted in Table-I.
From Table I, we observe that the critical points P1andP2are always exists for any
values of λbut the critical points P3andP4are exist for λ2<6. Also, for these four
critical points P1,P2,P3andP4, the value of Ω m= 0 and Ω φ= 1 represent only the dark

We analyze the stability behaviour of the critical points which is shown in Table I. Now,
we investigate the stability of these critical points of the autonomo us system of equations
(21)-(23) by ﬁnding the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at ( x,y). To analyze the
stability behaviour of the critical points, we need to ﬁnd the eigenva lues of the ﬁrst-order
perturbation matrix which have been presented in Table II.

From Table II, for λ=−√
6, the critical point P1is nonhyperbolic otherwise hyper-
bolic. Also, for λ=√
6, the point P2is nonhyperbolic otherwise it is hyperbolic. For
the critical point P1, ifλ >−√
6 then the signature of all the eigenvalues λ1,λ2andλ3
are positive this shows that the critical point P1is unstable node which has been pre-
sented in Figure I, while if λ <−√
6 then two eigenvalues λ1andλ3are positive and
one eigenvalue λ2is negative. Due to presence of positive and negative eigenvalues, t he
critical point P1is saddle node for λ <−√
6 which has been presented in Figure II. For
the critical point P2, ifλ <√
6 then the signature of all the eigenvalues λ1,λ2andλ3are
positive. Due to presence of positive eigenvalues, the critical point P2is unstable which
9has been presented in Figure II, while if λ >√
6 then two eigenvalues λ1andλ3are
positive and one eigenvalue λ2is negative. Due to presence of both positive and negative
eigenvalues, the critical point P2is saddle node which has been presented in Figure I.
For critical points P1andP2, Ωm= 0 and Ω φ= 1 shows that the Universe is in kinetic
energy dominated phase. At these points, the corresponding EoS parameter ωTot= 1 and
the deceleration parameter q= 2 implies that the Universe is in decelerated phase. For
λ∈(−√
6,√
6), the critical points P1andP2represent the repeller in phase space which
has been presented in Figure I and Figure II.

Moreover, the eigenvalues of the critical points P3andP4are same and they are hyper-
bolic in nature. For these two critical points if 3 < λ2<6 then two eigenvalues λ1andλ3
are positive and one eigenvalues λ2is negative. Due to presence of positive and negative
eigenvalues these points are behave like saddle point which are shown in Figure III. If
λ2<3 then all the eigenvalues ( λ1,λ2,λ3) of these two critical points are negative. This
represents that these two critical points ( P3,P4) are stable node which has been shown in
Figure IV. From Table I, we see that for the critical points P3andP4the values of density
parameters Ω m= 0 and Ω φ= 1. This shows that the scalar ﬁeld dominated solutions.
Forλ2<2, the values of deceleration parameter ( q) and the EoS parameter ( ωTot) are
less than zero and from Figure V, Figure VI shows that both the valu es tend to −1. This
conﬁrms that the expansion of the Universe is accelerated near th e critical points P3and
P4whereas from Figure VI, we say that the value of EoS parameter ωTot=−1 leads to
the ΛCDM model.

HereQbe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter and it indic ates the
transfer of energy density from DE to DM. We consider that this int eraction be a small
correction to the evolution history of the Universe. If |Q| ≫0, then the Universe would
be in the matter dominated regime (if Q>0) or the Universe would be in the matter
dominated period, changing to the formation of galaxies and large sc ale structure (if
Q<0) [33]. In present time the interaction Qis unspeciﬁed, only assumed that it does
not change sign during the cosmic evolution. The appropriate form o f the interaction
cannot be determined from phenomenological requirements due to the unknown nature of
the dark matter and dark energy. Also, from point of view of ﬁeld th eory, the interaction
appears naturally between the dark components. The interaction Qbetween the dark
matter and dark energy of the continuity equations (29)-(30) mu st be a function of the

2.Q=Q(Hρφ), 3.Q=Q[H(ρm+ρφ)], 4.Q=Q(Hρφ,Hρm). In our work, we choose
Q=αHρm, where the parameter αis dimensionless, positive- deﬁnite andsmall constant.

N=logadenotes the logarithmic time with respect to the scale factor a[35]. To obtain
the critical points ﬁrst, equating the system of equations (33)-( 34) equal to zero, we
discuss the stability of the critical points. We assume a simplest linear functional form of
f(Q) gravity such as f(Q) =−α1Q−α2, whereα1andα2are constants. If we consider
α1= 1 and α2= 0 then the above model reduced to f(Q) =−Qwhich is identical to
General Relativity in ﬂat space. To derive the above autonomous sy stem of ordinary
diﬀerential equations, we use f(Q) =−α1Q−α2and the interaction term Q=αHρm.

the Jacobian matrix of the system (31)-(33) at each point. So the following six critical

From Table III, we analyze that the critical points M1andM2exist for all values of λ
andαand the critical points M3andM4exist for λ2<6. Also, for these four critical
pointsM1,M2,M3andM4, the values of Ω m= 0 and Ω φ= 1 represent only the dark
energy components (dark matter is absent for these points). Th e critical points M5and
M6exist only for 2 αλ2+ (α−3)2>0. Now we discuss the stability behaviors of the
critical points M1,M2,M3,M4,M5andM6of the autonomous system of diﬀerential
equations (31)-(33) by ﬁnding the eigenvalues of the Jacobian mat rix at (x,y,Ωm). To

From Table IV, for λ=−√
6, the critical point M1is nonhyperbolic otherwise
hyperbolic. Also, for λ=√
6, the point M2is nonhyperbolic otherwise it is hyperbolic.
For the critical point M1, ifλ >−√
6, then the signature of all the eigenvalues γ1,γ2and
γ3are positive, this shows that the critical point M1is unstable node which has been
presented in Figure VII, while if λ <−√
6 , then two eigenvalues γ1andγ3are positive
and one eigenvalue γ2is negative. Due to presence of positive and negative eigenvalues,
the critical point M1is saddle node for λ <−√
6 which has been presented in Figure
VIII. For the critical point M2, ifλ <√
6, then the signature of all the eigenvalues γ1,
γ2andγ3are positive. Due to presence of positive eigenvalues, the critical p ointM2is
unstable which has been presented in Figure VIII, while if λ >√
6 then two eigenvalues
15γ1andγ3are positive and one eigenvalue γ2is negative. Due to presence of both positive
and negative eigenvalues, the critical point M2is saddle node which has been presented in
Figure VII. For critical points M1andM2, Ωm= 0 and Ω φ= 1 shows that the Universe
is in kinetic energy dominated phase. At these points, the correspo nding EoS parameter
ωTot= 1 and the deceleration parameter q= 2 implies that the Universe is in decelerated
phase. For λ∈(−√
6,√
6), the critical points M1andM2represent the repeller in phase
space which has been presented in Figure VII and Figure VIII.

At the critical points M3andM4, all the eigenvalues are same and they are hyperbolic
in nature. For these two critical points if 0 < α <3−λ2andλ2<6, then all the
eigenvalues γ1,γ2andγ3are negative. Since all the eigenvalues have negative real part,
then the critical points M3andM4are stable point and behave like attractor which has
been presented in Figure IX. But if 0 < α <3−λ2, then the eigenvalues γ1andγ3
are negative but if λ2>6, then the eigenvalue γ2is positive. So the signatures of the
eigenvalues of the points M3andM4are both positive and negative. Due to the presence
of positive and negative eigenvalues, the critical points M3andM4are saddle point
which has been presented in Figure X. From Table III, we see that fo r the critical points
M3andM4, the values of density parameters are Ω m= 0 and Ω φ= 1. This shows that
the scalar ﬁeld dominated solutions. For λ2<2, the values of deceleration parameter
(q) and the EoS parameter ( ωTot) both are less than zero and from Figure V, Figure VI
shows that both the values are goes to −1. This conﬁrms that there is an accelerating
phase of the Universe near the critical points M3andM4whereas from Figure VI, we
say that the value of EoS parameter ωTot=−1 leads to the ΛCDM model.
The critical points M5andM6are same. For all λandα >0 these two critical points
are non hyperbolic because one eigenvalue γ1is zero. To discuss the stability criteria of

these two critical points M5andM6are not possible by using linear stability theory. For
these two points, if α= 3−λ2then from Table III, we see that the value of the density
parameters Ω m= 0 and Ω φ= 1 show that the Universe dominated by dark energy
components. From Table III, the value of deceleration parameter of the critical points
M5andM6isq=1−α

then the Universe is in decelerated phase.

which are shown in Table III. From Table III and Table IV, we observe that the critical
pointsM1andM2are not locally stable because they are saddle point or unstable point

we see that the equilibrium points M1andM2are classical stable only but conditional
quantum stable. The critical point M1be quantum stable if H≥1

then the critical point M2be quantum stable. The critical points M3andM4are same

VI. Conclusions
In this paper, we have discussed a dynamical system analysis of f(Q) gravity theory.
We assumed a f(Q) model which is f(Q) =−α1Q−α2, where α1andα2are free
parameters. The matter is considered as dark matter (DM) and da rk energy (DE) which
are presented by dust and a scalar ﬁeld. We discuss the stability ana lysis and phase
space analysis of interacting dark energy in f(Q) gravity by introducing a interaction
Qbetween the dark matter and the dark energy of the Universe. We evaluated the

autonomous system of diﬀerential equations from Friedmann equa tions by introducing
some new dimensionless variables which are normalized over Hubble sca le. To discuss
the stability analysis, we found critical points from the set of auton omous diﬀerential
equations and we have found six critical points for interaction betw een DM and DE
which are presented in Table III. We get a ﬁnite phase plot of the aut onomous system
of equations and this phase space is bounded by Ω m= 0 and Ω m= 1 which forms a
paraboloid. In this model, we obtained six critical points as M1(1,0,0),M2(−1,0,0),

λ2). From Table III, we ﬁnd that the critical points
M1andM2are unstable and saddle solutions depending on the value of λand for these
two points, the Universe is dominated by kinetic energy of the scalar ﬁeld. The value
of deceleration parameter for these two points ( M1,M2) isq= 2 which shows that the
Universe is in decelerated phase. On the other hand, for the critica l pointM3andM4,
we get saddle and unstable solutions depending on the value of λandα. There exists
an acceleration expansion of the Universe near the points M3andM4. For the critical
pointsM3andM4ifλ2<2, then the Universe is in quintessence phase and for λ2= 0,
20the value of EoS parameter ωm=−1 represents the ΛCDM model. For 2 < λ2<3,
the points M3andM4are stable which is already discussed in local stability analysis
and at these points, the value of density parameters Ω m= 0 and Ω φ= 1 shows that
the Universe is dominated by kinetic energy. Further, for the critic al points M5and
M6one eigenvalue γ1is zero shows that these two points are non hyperbolic and linear
stability theory fails to discuss the stability analysis of these points. The Universe is
accelerating or decelerating near these two points M5andM6which depends on the
value of α. Ifα >1, then the expansion of Universe is accelerating and for α <1,
the expansion of Universe is decelerating. From several cosmologic al observations,
the value of EoS parameter as: ωφ=−1.035+0.055
−0.059(Supernovae Cosmological Project),
ωφ=−1.073+0.090
−0.089(WMAP+CMB), ωφ=−1.03±0.03(Planck 2018) [39–41]. From
Table III, our obtained values of EoS parameter ( ωφ) of this f(Q) model lies within
these observational values. The present value of deceleration pa rameter obtained from
the cosmological observations as: q=−1.08±0.29 [42] and our obtained values of
deceleration parameter (Table III) lies within this range.
Moreover, we have investigated the classical as well as quantum st ability of the model.
note that these two types of stability are not correlated because the local stability
analysis of the critical points depends on the perturbations δx,δyandδΩmbut the
classical stability of the model is connected to the perturbations δpand depends on the
conditions C2
s≥0 while the quantum stability depends on the perturbations δφwith
some restrictions which is taken from the inequalities (41). From Tab le VI, the critical
points can be classiﬁed into three categories namely
(i) unstable points at which the model is stable.
(ii) stable points at which model is unstable and
(iii) stable points with stable for both classical and quantum model.
From Table VI, the critical points M1andM2are classical stable but locally they are
unstable. The critical model M3andM4are classical stable but in local stability analysis,
they are unstable critical points. From the autonomous system of equations (33 - 35), we
observed that the accelerated or decelerated expansion of the U niverse near the critical
pointsM3andM4is in quintessence phase. In conclusion, the modiﬁed gravity with non -
metricity scalar Q, namely f(Q) gravity which can provide some new exciting features to
the study of the Universe. We considered the f(Q) gravity model as f(Q) =−α1−α2.
Forα1= 1 andα2= 0, the symmetric teleparallel gravity is reduced to GR at f(Q) =−Q
gravity model.
