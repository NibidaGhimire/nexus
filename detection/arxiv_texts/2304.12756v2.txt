CANONICAL DIVISORS
MASATOMO SAWAHARA
Abstract. We shall consider minimal analytic compactiﬁcations of the aﬃne plane with singu-
larities. In previous work, Kojima and Takahashi proved tha t any minimal analytic compactiﬁ-
cation of the aﬃne plane, which has at worse log canonical sin gularities, is a numerical del Pezzo
surface (i.e., a normal complete algebraic surface with the numerically ample anti-canonical di-
visor) and has only rational singularities. In this article , we show that any minimal analytic
compactiﬁcation of the aﬃne plane with the nef canonical div isor has an irrational singularity.
Throughout this article, we work over the complex number ﬁel dC.
1.Introduction
LetXbea normal compact analytic surfaceandlet Γ bea closed (ana lytic) curveon X. Then
wesay that ( X,Γ) is aminimal compactiﬁcation of theaﬃneplane C2ifX\Γ is biholomorphicto
C2andΓ is irreducible(see also Deﬁnition 2.5). This article i s devoted to adiscussion of minimal
compactiﬁcations of the aﬃne plane. [15] proved that if ( X,Γ) is a minimal compactiﬁcaiton of
C2andXis smooth then Xis the projective plane P2and Γ is a line on P2. Hence, we consider
minimal compactiﬁcations of the aﬃne plane with singular po ints in what follows.
In previous works, minimal compactiﬁcations of C2, which are normal hypersurfaces in P3,
have been studied by [3] and [14]. Moreover, minimal compact iﬁcations of C2with at most log
canonical singularities have been studied. More precisely , minimal compactiﬁcations of C2with
at most Du Val singularities (resp. log terminal singularit ies, log canonical singularities) were
studied by [11], etc. (resp. [7, 9], [8]) (see also [17] for th e related work). In particular, the
following result is summarized in [8]:
Theorem 1.1 ([8, Theorem 1.1 (1) and (2)]) .Let(X,Γ)be a minimal compactiﬁcation of C2.
Assume that Xhas at worse log canonical singularities and Sing(X)/\e}atio\slash=∅. Then:
(1)Xis a numerical del Pezzo surface (see §§2.2, for this deﬁnition) of Picard rank one.
In particular, KXis not nef.
(2)All singularities of Xare rational.
In this article, we consider minimal compactiﬁcations of C2with singularities worse than log
canonical singularities. Note that for such a minimal compa ctiﬁcation of C2either the anti-
canonical divisor is numerically ample or the canonical div isor is nef; indeed, its Picard rank is
equal to one. Our main result is stated as follows:
Theorem 1.2. Let(X,Γ)be a minimal compactiﬁcation of the aﬃne plane C2. If the canonical
divisorKXis nef, then Xhas an irrational singular point.
For anormal complete rational algebraic surface X, all singularities of Xarerational provided
that−KXis numerically ample (see [5] or [6]). Hence, we obtain the fo llowing corollary:
Corollary 1.3. Let(X,Γ)be a minimal compactiﬁcation of the aﬃne plane C2such thatXis
a normal complete algebraic surface. Then all singularities ofXare rational if and only if Xis
a numerical del Pezzo surface.

Organization of article. In Section 2, we review deﬁnitions of compactiﬁcations of th e aﬃne
plane and prepare some basic notations and facts in order to p rove the main result. In Section 3,
we deal with some results of minimal compactiﬁcations of C2. We then refer to [8] (see also [7]).
In Section 4, we observe birational transformations of a com pactiﬁcation ( V,C+D) ofC2, whose
Cisa(−1)-curveand Dcontains abranchingcomponent, inducedbyaminimalcompac tiﬁcation
(X,Γ) ofC2by the minimal resolution. Especially, assuming that KXis numerically ample, we
show that there exists a birational morphism /tildewidef:V→/tildewideVbetween smooth projective surfaces
such that ( /tildewideV,/tildewideC+/tildewideD) is a compactiﬁcation of C2and corresponds to a minimal compactiﬁcation
(/tildewideX,/tildewideΓ) ofC2withK/tildewideX≡0 by the contraction of /tildewideD, where /tildewideCis a unique ( −1)-curve on /tildewidef∗(D)
and/tildewideD:=/tildewidef∗(D)−/tildewideC. In Section 5, we will prove Theorem 1.2. In other words, lett ing (X,Γ)
be a minimal compactiﬁcation of C2with the nef canonical divisor KX, we show that Xhas
an irrational singular point by using arguments in Section 3 and Section 4. We shall brieﬂy
outline this proof. Let ( V,C+D) be a compactiﬁcation of C2induced by ( X,Γ) by the minimal
resolution. Notethatthereisauniqueconnectedcomponent EofDwithabranchingcomponent
(see Lemma 3.3). At ﬁrst, assuming that KXis numerically trivial, we ﬁnd an eﬀective Z-divisor
ZonVsuch that Supp( Z) = Supp(E) andKV+Z≡0; in particular, pa(Z) = 1. Meanwhile,
assuming that KXis numerically ample, we construct an eﬀective Z-divisorZonVsatisfying
Supp(Z) = Supp(E) andpa(Z) = 1 by using a birational morphism /tildewidef:V→/tildewideVas above. By
these considerations combined with Artin’s result ([1]), w e obtain a connected component of D,
which is contracted to an irrational singular point. Finall y, Section 6 presents some problems.
Conventions. A reduced eﬀective divisor Don a smooth projective surface is called an SNC-
divisorifDhas only simple normal crossings.
For any weighted dual graph, a vertex ◦with the weight mcorresponds to an m-curve (see
also the following Notation). Exceptionally, we omit this w eight (resp. we omit this weight and
use the vertex •instead of ◦) ifm=−2 (resp.m=−1).
Notation. We will use the following notations:
•KX: the canonical divisor of a normal surface X.
•ϕ∗(D): the total transform of a divisor Dby a morphism ϕ.
•ψ∗(D): the direct image of a divisor Dby a morphism ψ.
•(D·D′): the intersection number of two divisors DandD′(with Mumford’s rational
intersection number (cf. [12, 16]).
•(D)2: the self-intersection number of a divisor D(with Mumford’s rational intersection
number (cf. [12, 16]).
•D1≡D2:D1andD2are numerically equivalent.
•Fm: the Hirzebruch surface of degree m, i.e.,Fm≃P(OP1⊕OP1(m)).
•m-curve: a smooth projective rational curve with seif-inter section number m.

2.Preliminaries
2.1.Contractility of divisors on smooth projective surfaces. LetVbe a smooth projec-
tive surface, and let Dbe a connected reduced divisor on V. We quickly review the contractility
condition by analytic means of D.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let the notation be the same as above. Then Dcan becontracted if there
exists a proper surjective morphism π:V→Xto a normal analytic surface such that π(D) is
a point and V\Supp(D) is isomorphic to X\{π(D)}as an analytic space.MINIMAL COMPACTIFICATIONS OF THE AFFINE PLANE WITH NEF CANO NICAL DIVISORS 3
Lemma 2.2. With the same notation as above, Dcan be contracted if and only if the intersection
matrix ofDis negative deﬁnite.
Proof.This assertion follows from [12] and [4]. /square
Lemma 2.3. With the same notation as above, assume further that Dcan be contracted. Then
Dis contracted to a rational singular point if and only if for e very non-zero eﬀective Z-divisor
ZonVwithSupp(Z) = Supp(D), thenpa(Z)≤0.
Proof.See [1]. /square
In what follows, assume that every irreducible component of Dis a smooth rational curve
with self-intersection number ≤ −2 and the intersection matrix of Dis negative deﬁnite. Let
D=/summationtext
iDibe the decomposition of Dinto irreducible components. Since the intersection
matrix ofDis negative deﬁnite, there exists uniquely a Q-divisorD♯=/summationtext
iαiDionVsuch that
(Di·KV+D♯) = 0 for every irreducible component DiofD. By [18, Lemma 7.1], we note that
D♯is eﬀective.
Lemma 2.4. With the same notation and the assumptions as above, we have t he following
assertions:
(1)LetD0andD1be irreducible components of Dsuch that (D0·D1) = 1. Ifα0>0, then
α1>0.
(2)Letrbe a positive integer, and let D0,D1,...,D rbe irreducible components of Dsuch
that(D0·D−D0) =rand(D0·Di) = 1fori= 1,...,r. Ifα0,α1,...,α r−1∈Z, then
αr∈Z.
Proof.In (1), for simplicity, we put m1:=−(D1)2≥2. Since −(D1·KV) = (D1·D♯), we then
have−(m1−2)≥ −m1α1+α0>−m1α1. Thus, we obtain α1>m1−2
m1≥0 by virtue of m1≥2.
In (2), for simplicity, we put m0:=−(D0)2. Since−(D0·KV) = (D0·D♯), we then have
−(m0−2) =−m0α0+/summationtextr
i=1αi. Here,α0,α1,...,α r−1andm0are integers by the assumption.
Thus, we know that αr∈Z. /square
2.2.Some notations and properties of compactiﬁcations of the aﬃne plane. A normal
completed surface Xis anumerical del Pezzo surface if the anti-canonical divisor −KXis
numerically ample. In other words, ( −KX)2>0 and (−KX·Γ)>0 for every curve Γ on X
with Mumford’s rational intersection number (cf. [12, 16]) . Our goal in this article is to show
that any minimal compactiﬁcation of the aﬃne plane with at wo rse rational singularities is a
numerical del Pezzo surface. For this purpose, we shall revi ew some deﬁnitions and properties
of compactiﬁcations of C2.
Deﬁnition 2.5. LetXbe a normal compact analytic surface and let Γ be a compact ana lytic
curve onX. Then:
(1) The pair ( X,Γ) is acompactiﬁcaion of the aﬃne plane C2ifX\Γ is biholomorphic to
C2.
(2) A compactiﬁcation ( X,Γ) of the aﬃne plane C2isminimal if Γ is irreducible.
We also recall minimal normal compactiﬁcations of C2.
Deﬁnition 2.6. Let (V,∆) be a compactiﬁcation of the aﬃne plane C2such thatVis a smooth
projective surface and ∆ is an SNC-divisor on V. Then we say that ( V,∆) is aminimal normal
compactiﬁcation ofC2if (C·∆−C)≥3 for any ( −1)-curveCon Supp(∆).
It is known that minimal normal compactiﬁcations of C2are completely classiﬁed by Morrow
([13]). However, this article will not go into detail becaus e there is no direct use for this
classiﬁcation.
At the end of this subsection, we shall discuss the canonical divisors of minimal compactiﬁ-
cations of the aﬃne plane. Let ( X,Γ) be a minimal compactiﬁcation of C2, letπ:V→Xbe4 MASATOMO SAWAHARA
the minimal resolution, let Dbe the reduced exceptional divisor of π, and letCbe the proper
transform of Γ by π. We notice that ( V,C+D) is a compactiﬁcation of C2. LetD=/summationtextn

be the decomposition of Dinto irreducible components. Since the intersection matri x ofDis
negative deﬁnite, there exists uniquely an eﬀective Q-divisorD♯=/summationtextn
i=1αiDionVsuch that
(Di·KV+D♯) = 0 for every irreducible component DiofD. Then we obtain Lemma 2.7:
Lemma 2.7. With the same notation as above, we assume further that Cis a(−1)-curve. Then
the following assertions hold:
(1)The anti-canonical divisor −KXis numerically ample if and only if (D♯·C)<1.
(2)The canonical divisor KXis numerically trivial if and only if (D♯·C) = 1.
(3)The canonical divisor KXis numerically ample if and only if (D♯·C)>1.
Proof.We shall prove the assertion (1). Since the Picard rank of Xis equal to one, we can write
Γ≡ −aKXforsomea∈Q>0. Hence, −KXisnumericallyampleifandonlyif −(KX·Γ)>0with
Mumford’s rational intersection number (see [12, 16]). Mor eover, by the deﬁnition of Mumford’s
rational intersection number, we can compute ( KX·Γ) = (π∗(KX)·π−1
∗(Γ)) = (KV+D♯·C) =
−1+(D♯·C) becauseπ∗(KX)≡KV+D♯. Thus, we obtain the assertion (1). Other assertions
are the same as (1) and are left to the reader. /square
Remark 2.8.We mainly consider the situation ρ(V)>2 in this article. Then we will know that
Cis a (−1)-curve by Lemma 3.1 (3) below.

D=/summationtextn
i=1Dibe the decomposition of Dinto irreducible components, I(D) = [(Di·Dj)]1≤i,j≤n.
In this article, for the weighted dual graph AofD, we deﬁne the determinant d(A) ofAby the
determinant of the matrix −I(D). Then we shall show the following lemmas:
Lemma 2.9. Let(V,∆)be a compactiﬁcation of C2such thatVis smooth, and let Abe the
weighted dual graph of ∆. Then we have d(A) =−1.
Proof.There exist two birational morphisms µ:¯V→Vandν:¯V→P2
Cbetween smooth
projective surfaces such that V\Supp(∆) ≃P2
C\Supp((ν◦µ−1)∗(∆))≃C2. LetBbe the
weighted dual graph of ( ν◦µ−1)∗(∆). Since ( ν◦µ−1)∗(∆) is a line on P2
C, we obtain d(B) =−1.
On the other hand, since d(A) =d(B) (see [2, (3.4)]), we obtain d(A) =−1. /square
Lemma 2.10. LetDandEbe two connected reduced divisors on a smooth projective sur face
Vand letAandBbe two weighted dual graphs of DandE, respectively. Assume that there
exists a(−1)-curveConVsuch that (C·D) = (C·E) = 1andC+D+Ecan be contracted
to a single (−1)-curve (on a smooth projective surface). Then d(A)andd(B)are prime to each
other.
Proof.By the assumption and [2, (3.4)], there exist two integers aandbsuch that we have:
1 =/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingled(A)−a0
−1 1 −1
0−b d(B)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=d(A)d(B)−b·d(A)−a·d(B)
= (d(B)−b)d(A)+(−a)d(B).(2.1)
This implies that d(A) andd(B) are prime to each other. /square
3.Boundaries of minimal compactifications of the affine plane
In this section, we summarize some results on minimal compac tiﬁcations of C2, mainly based
on [8] (see also [7]).
Let (X,Γ) be a minimal compactiﬁcation of C2such that Sing( X)/\e}atio\slash=∅, letπ:V→Xbe the
minimal resolution of X, letDbe the reduced exceptional divisor of π, and letCbe the proper
transform of Γ by π. Then we obtain a compactiﬁcation ( V,C+D) ofC2.MINIMAL COMPACTIFICATIONS OF THE AFFINE PLANE WITH NEF CANO NICAL DIVISORS 5
The following facts (Lemmas 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) refer to [8, Lem mas 4.1–4.6]. They are shown
by the computation of birational transformations between s mooth projective surfaces and the
classiﬁcation of minimal normal compactiﬁcations of the aﬃ ne plane (see [13]). As a remark, [8]
assumes that Xhas at most log canonical singularities, but results [8, Lem mas 4.1–4.6] do not
use this assumption. Hence, the following Lemma 3.1 be shown immediately by referring to the
proof of [8, Lemmas 4.1–4.4], so we omit the proof of this lemm a in this article:
Lemma 3.1 ([8, Lemmas 4.1–4.4]) .With the same notation as above, we have:
(1)♯Sing(X)≤2. In other words, Dconsists of at most two connected components.
(2)C+Dis an SNC-divisor.
(3)IfCis not a(−1)-curve, then V=Fmfor somem≥2.
IfXhas at most log canonical singularities, then the minimal co mpactiﬁcation ( X,Γ) ofC2
has already been studied by [7, 8]. In what follows, assume th atXhas a singular point worse
than log canonical singularities. Then Cis a (−1)-curve by Lemma 3.1 (3) because the Picard
rank ofVis greater than two. Let ν:V→Wbe a sequence of contractions of ( −1)-curves
and subsequently (smoothly) contractible curves in Supp( D), starting with the contraction of C,
suchthat thepair ( W,DW) is aminimal normalcompactiﬁcation of C2, whereDW:=ν∗(C+D).
Lemma 3.2. With the same notation and assumptions as above, we may assum e the following
two conditions:
•(W,DW) = (Fm,M+F)for somem≥2, whereMandFare the minimal section and
a ﬁber of the P1-bundleFm→P1
C, respectively.
•The pointν(C)does not lie on M.
Proof.We writeV=V0f1→V1f2→...fℓ→Vℓ=W(ℓ∈Z>0) as a composition of blowing-downs
fiat a (−1)-curve for i= 1,...,ℓ. Moreover, we set νi:=fi◦··· ◦f1fori= 1,...,ℓ. By [8,
Lemma 4.5], we know that ( W,DW) = (P2
C,L) or (Fm,M+F), whereLis a line on P2
C.
Assume that ( W,DW) = (P2
C,L). Then we know that Vℓ−1=F1andνℓ−1,∗(C+D) consists
of the minimal section M1and the ﬁber F1, which is f−1
ℓ,∗(L), of the P1-bundle F1→P1
C.
We noteℓ≥2 becauseV/\e}atio\slash=F1. Moreover, we notice that the point νℓ−1(C) lies on the
intersection M1∩F1. Indeed, otherwise, we know that C+Dcontains at least two rational
curves with self-intersection number ≥ −1 by a similar argument to [8, Lemma 4.5], so that
we obtain a contradiction. Hence, Vℓ−2is a weak del Pezzo surface of degree 7 with only one
(−2)-curvef−1
ℓ−1,∗(M1). Moreover, Vℓ−2contains exactly two ( −1)-curvesf−1
ℓ−1,∗(F1) and the
other, say Cℓ−2. Then we know that νℓ−2,∗(C+D) =f−1
ℓ−1,∗(M1) +f−1
ℓ−1,∗(F1) +Cℓ−2and
νℓ−2(C)∈f−1
ℓ−1,∗(F1)∩Cℓ−2. Hence, by replacing fℓ◦fℓ−1to the contraction Vℓ−2→F2of
f−1
ℓ−1,∗(F1), we can assume that ( W,DW) = (F2,M+F) andν(C)/\e}atio\slash∈M.
Assume that ( W,DW) = (Fm,M+F) for somem≥2 butν(C)∈M. ThenVℓ−2contains
exactly two ( −1)-curvesf−1
ℓ,∗(F) and the other, say Cℓ−1. By the conﬁgurations, we know that
νℓ−1,∗(C+D) =f−1
ℓ,∗(M)+f−1
ℓ,∗(F)+Cℓ−1andνℓ−1(C)∈f−1
ℓ,∗(F)∩Cℓ−1. Hence, by replacing
fℓto the contraction Vℓ−1→Fm+1off−1
ℓ,∗(F), we can assume that ( W,DW) = (Fm+1,M+F)
such thatν(C)/\e}atio\slash∈M. /square
Hence, we assume that ( W,DW) satisﬁes the assumption in Lemma 3.2. By applying an
argument of [8, Lemma 4.6], we then obtain the following lemm a:6 MASATOMO SAWAHARA

Proof.Bytheconstruction of ν, weknowthat νisthesequenceofblow-upsatapointon F\(M∩

and EM transformations (see [10, p. 92] and [10, p. 100], for t hese deﬁnitions). Thus, we obtain
this assertion. /square
4.Birational transformations of minimal compactifications o f the affine plane
Let (X,Γ) be a minimal compactiﬁcation of the aﬃne plane C2, letπ:V→Xbe the minimal
resolution, let Dbe the reduced exceptional divisor of π, and letCbe the proper transform of
Γ byπ. Then we obtain a compactiﬁcation ( V,C+D) of the aﬃne plane C2. Assume that X
has a non-cyclic quotient singular point, i.e., Dadmits a branching component. Hence, Cis a
(−1)-curve by Lemma 3.1 (3). In particular, we obtain the contr actionf:V→V′ofC. Then
there exists uniquely a ( −1)-curveC′on Supp(f∗(D)) by Lemma 3.1 (3). Put D′:=f∗(D)−C′.
Thus, (V′,C′+D′) is a compactiﬁcation of C2.
LetD=/summationtext

In this section, we study the birational morphism f: (V,C+D)→(V′,C′+D′); in particular,
the condition that the intersection matrix of D′is negative deﬁnite. From now on, we consider
the following three cases separately.
4.1.Case(1). In this subsection, with the same notation at the beginning o f§4, assume further
thatDis connected. Then ( C·D) = 1 and ( C′·D′)≤2. More precisely, Cmeets exactly one
irreducible component of D, sayD1, andC′meets at most two irreducible components of D′.
Then we notice C′=f∗(D1). In particular, D1is a (−2)-curve. Let AandBbe weighted dual
graphs of connected components of D′−C′, whereB=∅andd(B) := 1 if (C′·D′) = 1. We
may assume that Acontains a branching component. Then the weighted dual grap hs ofC+D
andC′+D′are as follows:

B/\e}atio\slash=∅andB=∅). Then we shall observe the relationship between d(A),d(B),d(A) andd(B).
We ﬁrst notice that C′+D′is a boundary of a compactiﬁcation of C2. By Lemma 2.9, we have:
−1 =/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1−1−1
−d(A)d(A) 0
−d(B) 0d(B)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=d(A)d(B)−d(A)d(B)−d(A)d(B). (4.1)
Moreover, as the intersection matrix of Dis negative deﬁnite, we obtain:/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2−1−1
−d(A)d(A) 0
−d(B) 0d(B)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=
(4.1)d(A)d(B)−1>0. (4.2)
By the above considerations, we obtain the following lemma:
Lemma 4.1. We have the following assertions:
(1)The intersection matrix of D′is negative deﬁnite.
(2)If(C·D♯)>1, then(C′·D′♯)≥1.
(3)If(C·D♯)≤1, then(C′·D′♯)<1.
Proof.In (1), this assertion is obvious because the weighted dual g raph ofD′is a subgraph of
the weighted dual graph of D.
In (2) and (3), since the intersection matrix of D′is negative deﬁnite by (1), there exists
uniquely an eﬀective Q-divisorD′♯=/summationtext

2be
coeﬃcients of D′

2:= 0 if (C′·D′) = 1. When
(C′·D′) = 2, we may assume that the weighted dual graphs AandBcorrespond to connected
components of D′containing D′
1andD′
2, respectively. By the Cramer formula (cf. (5.1)), we
can write:

2= 0 if (C′·D′) = 1. Since D1is a (−2)-curve,
we further obtain a=a′
1d(B) +a′
2d(A) by using the cofactor expansion of the determinant.
Meanwhile, we know that ( C·D♯) =α1and (C′·D′♯) =α′
1+α′
2. Thus, we obtain assertions
(2) and (3) because d(A)d(B) andaare positive integers. /square
4.2.Case(2). In this subsection, with the same notation at the beginning o f§4, assume further
thatD′is connected but Dis not. Then ( C·D) = 2 and (C′·D′) = 1. More precisely, Cmeets
exactly two irreducible components of D, sayD1andD2, andC′meets exactly one irreducible

1. Here, we may assumethat D′
1=f∗(D1). Then we notice C′=f∗(D2).
In particular, D1andD2are a (−3)-curve and a ( −2)-curve, respectively. Let g:V′→V′′
be a contraction of C′. SinceDadmits a branching component, so does ( g◦f)∗(D) =g∗(D′)
by construction of fandg. Hence, there exists uniquely a ( −1)-curveC′′on Supp(g∗(D′)) by
Lemma 3.1 (3) and the conﬁguration of C′+D′. PutD′′:=g∗(D′)−C′′. Thus, (V′′,C′′+D′′)
is a compactiﬁcation of C2. LetAandBbe weighted dual graphs of two connected components
ofD′′−C′′, whereB=∅andd(B) := 1 if (C′′·D′′) = 1. We may assume that Acontains a

d(B),d(A) andd(B). We ﬁrst notice that C′′+D′′is a boundary of a compactiﬁcation of C2.
By Lemma 2.9, we have the same formula (4.1). Moreover, as the intersection matrix of Dis
negative deﬁnite, we obtain:

By the above considerations, we obtain the following lemma:
Lemma 4.2. With the notation as above, then the following assertions ho ld:
(1)The intersection matrix of D′′is negative deﬁnite.
(2)If(C·D♯)>1, then(C′′·D′′♯)≥1.
(3)If(C·D♯)≤1, then(C′′·D′′♯)<1.
Proof.In (1), this assertion is obvious because the weighted dual g raph ofD′is a subgraph of
the weighted dual graph of D.
In (2) and (3), since the intersection matrix of D′′is negative deﬁnite by (1), there exists
uniquely an eﬀective Q-divisorD′′♯=/summationtext

When (C′′·D′′) = 2, we may assume that the weighted dual graphs AandBcorrespond to
connected components of D′′containing D′′

the determinant. Meanwhile, we know that ( C·D♯) =α1and (C′′·D′′♯) =α′′

obtain assertions (2) and (3) because d(A)d(B) andaare positive integers. /square
At the end of this subsection, we note that the intersection m atrix ofD′is not always negative
deﬁnite. Indeed, we can construct the example as follows:

Letf:V→V′be a contraction of C, letC′be the unique ( −1)-curve on Supp( f∗(D)) and

notice that C′+D′is a boundary of a compactiﬁcation of C2. By Lemma 2.9, we have:

Moreover, as the intersection matrix of Dis negative deﬁnite, we obtain:
2d(A)−d(A)>0, md(B)−d(B)>0. (4.5)
By the above considerations, we obtain the following lemma:
Lemma 4.4. With the notation as above, then the following assertions ho ld:
(1)The intersection matrix of D′is negative deﬁnite.
(2)If(C·D♯)>1, then(C′·D′♯)≥1.
(3)If(C·D♯) = 1, then(C′·D′♯)≤1.
(4)If(C·D♯)<1, then(C′·D′♯)<1.
Proof.In (1), suppose on the contrary that the intersection matrix ofD′is not negative deﬁnite.
Since the weighted dual graph of the connected component of D′withD′
1is a subgraph of the
weighted dual graph of D, we infer from d(A)>0 that (m−1)d(B)−d(B)≤0. Then we obtain
d(B)≥1 by virtue of (4.5). On the other hand, we know that Ais an admissible twig by the
assumption and Lemma 3.3. In particular, d(A)≥1 andd(A)−d(A)≥1. Since the formula
(4.4) implies:
−1 ={d(A)−d(A)}{(m−1)d(B)−d(B)}−d(A)d(B),
we thus obtain ( m−1)d(B)−d(B) = 0 andd(A) =d(B) = 1. Here, d(A) = 1 implies A=∅
becauseAis an admissible twig. However, D′is then connected. This is a contradiction to the
assumption. The assertion (1) is thus proved.10 MASATOMO SAWAHARA
In (2), since the intersection matrix of D′is negative deﬁnite by (1), we see:
d(A){(m−1)d(B)−d(B)}>0. (4.6)

5.Proof of Theorem 1.2
In this section, we will prove Theorem 1.2. Notice that this t heorem is a consequence of the
following:
Theorem 5.1. Let(X,Γ)be a minimal compactiﬁcation of the aﬃne plane C2. Then we have
the following:
(1)If the canonical divisor KXis numerically trivial, then Xhas a singular point, which is
not rational.
(2)If the canonical divisor KXis numerically ample, then Xhas a singular point, which is
not rational.
In what follows, we shall prove Theorem 5.1. We thus prepare s ome notations. Let ( X,Γ)
be a minimal compactiﬁcation of C2, letπ:V→Xbe the minimal resolution, let Dbe the
reduced exceptional divisor of π, andCbe the proper transform of Γ by π, i.e.,C:=π−1
∗(Γ).
Then (V,C+D) is a compactiﬁcation of C2. LetD=/summationtext
iDibe the decomposition of Dinto
irreducible components. Since the intersection matrix of Dis negative deﬁnite, there exists
uniquely an eﬀective Q-divisorD♯=/summationtext
iαiDionVsuch that ( Di·KV+D♯) = 0 for every
irreducible component DiofD.
From now on, we consider two subsections separately. More pr ecisely, we will show Theorem
5.1 (1) and (2) in §§5.1 and §§5.2, respectively.
5.1.Proof of Theorem 5.1 (1). With the same notation as above, assume further that KX
is numerically trivial. Then KV+D♯≡0. Noting that Xhas exactly one singular point xworse
than log canonical singularities by [8, Theorem 1.1], we con sider the following claim:
Claim 5.2. D♯is aZ-divisor. Moreover, Supp(D♯)coincides with the exceptional set of the
minimal resolution at x.
If Claim 5.2 is true, then we can prove Theorem 5.1 (1) as follo ws:
Proof of “Claim 5.2 ⇒Theorem 5.1 (1)”. LetZbe the connected component of D♯such that
Supp(Z) coincides with the exceptional set of the minimal resoluti on atx. Since we assume12 MASATOMO SAWAHARA
that Claim 5.2 is true, every coeﬃcient of Zis a positive integer. Thus, we have pa(Z) =
1
2(Z·Z+KV)+1 =1
2(Z·D♯+KV)+1 = 1>0. By Lemma 2.3, this implies that x∈Xis an
irrational singular point. This completes the proof. /square
Hence, we will show Claim 5.2 in what follows.

(i): Assume i= 0. ThenC+D(0)+···+D(r)can be contracted to a single ( −1)-curve passing

Notice that each D(i)

the above contraction, respectively. Moreover, the diviso r corresponding to the above weighted
dual graph can be contracted to a single ( −1)-curve passing through the direct image D(r+1)

In (1), we note that/summationtextti
ℓ=1D(i)
2,ℓis a rational chain with self-intersection number ≤ −2. Hence,
we obtaind(Bi)>1 by the induction on ti. Now, suppose on the contrary d(Ai) = 0. Then
we obtain −a·d(Bi) = 1 for some a∈Zby facts (i) and (ii) at the beginning (see also (2.1)).
In particular, we have d(Bi) =±1 becauseais an integer; however, it contradicts d(Bi)>1.
Thus,d(Ai)/\e}atio\slash= 0.

At the end of this subsection, we provide some examples of min imal compactiﬁcations of C2

Indeed, there exists a birational morphism ν:V→Fmsuch that ( Fm,ν∗(C+D)) is a minimal
normal compactiﬁcation of C2as in Lemma 3.2. By a straightforward calculation, we know th at
the determinant of the intersection matrix of Dis equal to 2( m−2), so that the intersection
matrix ofDis negative deﬁnite. Hence, by Lemma 2.2, there exists a cont ractionπ:V→Xof
Dsuch that (X,π(C)) is a minimal compactiﬁcation of C2. LetD♯be theQ-divisor on Vsuch
thatKV+D♯≡π∗(KX). Then coeﬃcients of D♯are determined as follows:

Hence, by Lemma 2.7, KXis numerically trivial. In particular, π(D)∈Xis an irrational

Indeed, there exists a birational morphism ν:V→F2such that ( F2,ν∗(C+D)) is a minimal

thedeterminant of theintersection matrixof Dis equal to( m−2)(m−1), sothat theintersection

Dsuch that (X,π(C)) is a minimal compactiﬁcation of C2. LetD♯be theQ-divisor on Vsuch
thatKV+D♯≡π∗(KX). Then coeﬃcients of D♯are determined as follows:

Hence, by Lemma 2.7, KXis numerically trivial. In particular, Sing( X) consists of a cyclic
quotient singular point and an irrational singular point by Theorem 5.1 (1).
5.2.Proof of Theorem 5.1 (2). Let thenotation bethe sameat thebeginning §5, andassume
further that the canonical divisor KXis numerically ample. By Lemmas 2.7, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4,
we then obtain the following lemma:
Lemma 5.9. Let the notation be the same at the beginning §5, and assume further that KX
is numerically ample. Then there exists a birational morphis m/tildewidef:V→/tildewideVand there exists a
unique(−1)-curve/tildewideCon/tildewidef∗(D)such that the following properties on the divisor /tildewideD:=/tildewidef∗(D)−/tildewideC
hold:
•V\Supp(C+D)≃/tildewideV\Supp(/tildewideC+/tildewideD).
•The intersection matrix of /tildewideDis negative deﬁnite.
•Let/tildewideπ:/tildewideV→/tildewideXbe the contraction of /tildewideDand let us put /tildewideΓ :=/tildewideπ∗(/tildewideC). Then(/tildewideX,/tildewideΓ)be a
minimal compactiﬁcation of C2such thatK/tildewideXis numerically trivial.
By using Lemma 5.9, we can show Theorem 5.1 (2) as follows:
Proof of Theorem 5.1 (2). Let/tildewideDand (/tildewideX,/tildewideΓ) be the same as in Lemma 5.9. Let /tildewideD=/summationtext
j/tildewideDj
be the decomposition of /tildewideDinto irreducible components. Since the intersection matri x of/tildewideD

j/tildewideαj/tildewideDjon/tildewideVsuch that
(/tildewideDj·K/tildewideV+/tildewideD♯) = 0foreveryirreduciblecomponent /tildewideDjof/tildewideD. Moreover, letting /tildewideZbetheconnected
component of /tildewideD♯corresponding to a singular point worse than log canonical s ingularities, any
coeﬃcient of /tildewideZis a positive integer by Claim 5.2. Now, letting Ebe the connected component
ofDcorresponding to a singular point worse than log canonical s ingularities, we shall put:
Z:=/tildewidef−1
∗(/tildewideZ)+(E−/tildewidef−1
∗(/tildewideZ)red.). (5.2)
Then we have:
(Z·KV+Z) = (/tildewidef−1

+(E−/tildewidef−1

Here, by construction of /tildewidefand/tildewideZwe notice:
(/tildewidef−1

∗(/tildewideZ)) = (/tildewideZ·K/tildewideV+/tildewideZ) = 0,
(/tildewidef−1
∗(/tildewideZ)·E−/tildewidef−1
∗(/tildewideZ)red.) = (/tildewideZ·/tildewideC) = 1.16 MASATOMO SAWAHARA
Moreover, since E−/tildewidef−1
∗(/tildewideZ)red.is reduced and its dual graph is a tree, we know:
(E−/tildewidef−1

In summary, we have pa(Z) =1
2(Z·KV+Z) + 1 = 1>0. This implies that π(E)∈Xis a
singular point, which is not rational, by Lemma 2.3. /square
In the above proof, we present some examples for the reader’s convenience:

Here, in the above graph, each Diis an irreducible component of D. Indeed, there exists a
birational morphism ν:V→F3such that ( F3,ν∗(C+D)) is a minimal normal compactiﬁcation
ofC2as in Lemma 3.2. By a straightforward calculation, we know th at the determinant of the
intersection matrix of Dis equal to 21. Hence, there exists a contraction π:V→Xsuch that

Here, in the above graph, /tildewideCis a unique( −1)-curve on Supp( /tildewidef∗(D)) and each /tildewideDjis an irreducible

there exists a contraction /tildewideπ:/tildewideV→/tildewideXof/tildewideDsuch thatK/tildewideX≡0. Let/tildewideD♯=/summationtext11

6.Further problems
By argumentsin §4and §5, weinferthat minimalcompactiﬁcations of C2withthenumerically
trivial canonical divisors are restrictive. Hence, we esta blish the following problem:
Problem 6.1. Classify the minimal compactiﬁcations of the aﬃne plane C2with numerically
trivial canonical divisors.
We also present the following problem:18 MASATOMO SAWAHARA
Problem 6.2. LetSbe aQ-homology plane with logarithmic Kodaira dimension −∞such that
there exists a minimal compactiﬁcation (X,Γ)ofS(i.e.,Xis a normal analytic surface and Γ
is an irreducible curve on Xsuch thatX\Γis biholomorphic to S). Assume that every singular
point ofXis rational. Then when is the canonical divisor KXnef (especially, numerically
trivial) ?
Theorem 1.2 implies that there is no minimal compactiﬁcatio n (X,Γ) ofSsuch thatXhas at
worse rational singularities and KXis nef, ifS=C2. Meanwhile, we ﬁnd the following example.
Example 6.3. LetSbe the projective plane with an irreducible conic removed. I t is well
known that Sis aQ-homology plane with logarithmic Kodaira dimension −∞. LettingQbe a
irreducible conic on P2

Here, in the above graph, each Diis an irreducible component of D, andν−1
∗(Q) =D1. By
a straightforward calculation, we know that the determinan t of the intersection matrix of D
is equal to 16. Hence, by Lemma, 2.2 there exists a contractio nπ:V→XofDsuch that
(X,π∗(C)) is a minimal compactiﬁcation of S. Moreover, for any Z-divisorZ=/summationtext11
i=1xiDiwith
Supp(Z) = Supp(D), we seepa(Z)≤0 (see Appendix A). This implies that Sing( X) consists
of only one singular point, which is rational, by Lemma 2.3. M eanwhile, since the intersection
matrix ofDis negative deﬁnite, there exists uniquely an eﬀective Q-divisorD♯=/summationtext11
i=1αiDion
Vsuch that (Di·KV+D♯) = 0 for every irreducible component DiofD. Then we have:
α1=3
2, αi=i−1
2(i= 2,...,7), α8= 2, α9=α11= 1, α10= 2.
Hence, (C·D♯) =α11= 1. Thus, KXis nef; more precisely, numerically trivial (cf. Lemma 2.7) .
In particular, Xis not a numerical del Pezzo surface.

2x8(2−x8)≤ −3
2. This implies that ( Z·KV+Z)≤ −2
because (Z·KV+Z) is an integer. Hence, we assume x8≤2 in what follows. Suppose that
x2≥2. Then we have ( Z·KV+Z)≤b+x8≤ −x2

Assume that x8= 2. Ifx8= 2 andx7≥4, then we have ( Z·KV+Z)≤b+x8≤ −4+2 =−2.
In what follows, we consider the case x7≤3. Then we have ( Z·KV+Z)≤b+c+x8≤
−x7+c+x8≤ −3
2. This implies that ( Z·KV+Z)≤ −2 because ( Z·KV+Z) is an integer.
Finally, assume that x8= 1. Then we note d≤ −1. Ifx8= 1 andx7≥2, then we
have (Z·KV+Z)≤b+d+x8≤ −2−1 + 1 = −2. Ifx8= 1 andx7= 1, then we have

Hence, we thus obtain pa(Z)≤0.
