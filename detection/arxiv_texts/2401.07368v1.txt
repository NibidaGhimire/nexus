I. I NTRODUCTION
Integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare
applications has ushered in a new era of patient-centric care,
real-time monitoring, and data-driven decision-making. The
Global IoT in Healthcare Market value is estimated at USD
252.2 Billion in 2023 [1]. The size of this market is expected
to grow at a rate of CAGR 16.9% to USD 550.58 Billion in
2028. The Global IoT in Healthcare Market is segmented by
component into Medical Devices, Systems and Software, and
Services can be seen in Fig. 1, and the predicted market share
is shown in Fig. 2.
This paradigm shift, however, brings with it a set of unprece-
dented challenges, particularly in the domain of security. The
healthcare sector, characterized by its sensitive and confiden-
tial nature, is increasingly dependent on IoT devices for tasks
ranging from remote patient monitoring to managing medical
equipment and facilitating data-driven diagnoses as well as
device availability.As the healthcare industry undergoes a digital transfor-
mation with the widespread adoption of Internet of Things
(IoT) devices, the urgency to implement proactive security
measures becomes increasingly critical. The predicted cost
of cybercrime to the world economy in 2020 was less than
$1 trillion, a rise of more than 50% from 2018 [2]. The
interconnected nature of IoT devices introduces a complex
attack surface, leaving healthcare systems susceptible to a
myriad of potential threats. The landscape of cyber threats is
constantly evolving, with threat actors becoming more sophis-
ticated and resourceful. In recent years, the healthcare sector
has witnessed an alarming surge in cyber-attacks, ranging from
distributed denial of service (DDOS), Recon, Greeth flood,
UDPPlain, and ransomware targeting medical records to the
compromise of connected medical devices. These attacks can
jeopardize patient data privacy as well as it can potentially
disrupt healthcare services availability, putting patient lives at
risk.

Traditional security approaches, often based on predefined
signatures and rule-based systems, need help to keep pace with
the unpredictability of emerging threats. Cyber adversaries
frequently exploit unknown vulnerabilities, necessitating a
shift from reactive to proactive security measures, in the
healthcare IoT ecosystem, where the stakes are particularly
high due to the sensitive nature of patient information and the
criticality of medical devices, the traditional security paradigm
needs to provide comprehensive protection. The urgency to
address security concerns is further heightened by the factarXiv:2401.07368v1  [cs.CR]  14 Jan 2024Fig. 2. IoT in Healthcare Market, by Component (USD M), 2019-2028 [1].
that healthcare systems often cannot afford extended periods
of downtime or disruption.
Proactive security measures involve a shift from reactive
incident response to anticipatory risk mitigation. By leveraging
advanced technologies such as machine learning, organizations
can identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they
are exploited. This proactive approach is crucial in the health-
care IoT context, where the timely identification and mitigation
of risks can prevent data breaches, ensure the continuous
operation of medical devices, and safeguard patient well-
being. This paper presents a comprehensive examination of
the security landscape within healthcare IoT, identifies existing
challenges, and introduces an innovative ML-based architec-
ture designed to address these challenges while achieving up to
93.6% accuracy and reducing the cost of the monitor sensors
by a factor of x10 to fortifying the security requirement of
IoT devices in healthcare applications.
II. B ACKGROUND
Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices have made remote
monitoring in the healthcare sector possible, unleashing the
potential to keep patients safe and healthy and empowering
physicians to deliver excellent care. As communication be-
tween patients and physicians has gotten simpler and more
effective, it has also raised patient happiness and engagement.
In addition, remote patient monitoring minimizes hospital
stays and keeps patients from being readmitted. IoT has a
significant influence on both increasing treatment outcomes
and drastically lowering healthcare expenditures.
A. IoT in Healthcare
The usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare
has ushered in a transformative era, enhancing patient care,
optimizing operational efficiency, and revolutionizing how
healthcare providers deliver services, such as and not limited
to Remote Patient Monitoring, Connected Medical Devices,
Healthcare Asset Tracking, Smart Hospitals and Infrastruc-
ture, Medication Management, Smart Pills, Telehealth and
Telemedicine, Patient Engagement, and Data Analytics [3]. An
abstract healthcare IoT framework block diagram is shown in
Fig. 3.B. IoT Framework Anatomy
Communication : The Internet of Things (IoT) allows het-
erogeneous items to communicate with one another via a va-
riety of communication protocols, including Bluetooth, IEEE
802.15.4, NFC, Wi-Fi, RFID, ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB),
Z-wave, and long-term evolution (LTE), etc.
Computation : The computing power of the Internet of
Things is demonstrated via processing units (microprocessor,
microcontroller, field-programmable gateway array, system on
a chip), hardware platforms (Raspberry Pi, Mulle, T-Mote Sky,
Arduino, Intel Galilio, UDOO, etc.), and software platforms.
The operating system operates while the system is being acti-
vated, is the most significant software platform. The creation
of Internet of Things applications frequently makes use of
real-time operating systems (RTOS) [4].
Services : Identity-related, omnipresent, collaboratively
aware, and information aggregation services are the different
categories under which IoT services fall. The fundamental
services that are essential to other services’ functionality
are identity-related services [5]. Applications must detect
real-world items in order to display them in the virtual
environment. The sensor data is gathered, processed, and
reported to IoT applications by the information aggregation
services. Services that are aware of collaboration make
decisions and respond appropriately based on data from
services associated with aggregate.
Metadata : This is the ability to extract information from
different devices in the IoT and then offer the required services
to the user. Extraction contains discovering information, uses
of information, and modeling information.
C. Significance of Cybersecurity in Healthcare
In [6], the work was specially created with security and pri-
vacy in mind for the Internet of Things. The writers talk about
how the Internet of Things’ cloud created a dangerous issue for
the healthcare industry. In this study, recommendations were
provided to encourage the researcher to address the concerns
regarding the security and privacy of healthcare systems in the
context of the Internet of Things.
As discussed in the [7], the limitations of traditional security
measures, often characterized by static rule-based systems,
face significant limitations in the context of healthcare IoT.
The deterministic nature of rule-based systems proves inade-
quate in addressing the dynamic and evolving nature of cyber
threats. Moreover, these approaches struggle to adapt to the
heterogeneity of IoT devices, each with its unique communi-
cation protocols, data formats, and security requirements. This
reactive approach, while effective for known vulnerabilities,
falls short in addressing zero-day attacks and emerging threats
unique to healthcare IoT.
Recognizing the limitations of traditional security measures
and the evolving threat landscape, there is an imperative
to transition from reactive to proactive security measures in
healthcare IoT. Proactive security involves anticipatory risk
mitigation, continuous monitoring, and adaptive responses
based on real-time analysis of data patterns.Fig. 3. Healthcare IoT framework block diagram.
D. IoT in Healthcare Challenges
In [8], the author discusses the prediction of early symptoms
through the IoT, which is useful for the patient and a very
beneficial tool for society. It discusses all the papers related
to reviews and challenges associated with the IoT in the
healthcare system, which can be summarized to:
•Heterogeneity of Devices.
•Scale and V olume.
•Resource Constraints.
•Distributed Nature.
•Dynamic Nature.
•Data Privacy Concerns.
•Standards.
•Long Life-cycle.
•Edge and Fog Computing.
The complete comparison of challenges in traditional and
Health IoT security systems is shown in Table. I.
E. Machine Learning Approach
Machine Learning emerges as a catalyst in the paradigm
shift towards proactive security in healthcare IoT [9]. ML’s
capacity to analyze vast datasets, identify patterns, and au-
tonomously adapt to emerging threats seamlessly with the dy-
namic nature of healthcare IoT environments. ML algorithms
include but are not limited to anomaly detection, predictiveanalytics, dynamic threat intelligence, adaptive access control,
incident response automation, and behavioral analysis.
Additionally, healthcare IoT systems often deal with diverse
data and user profiles [10]. ML enables the customization of
security measures based on individualized risk assessments.
By understanding user behavior and access patterns, ML mod-
els can dynamically ensure that the right level of protection
is applied to different devices and users within the healthcare
ecosystem.
Furthermore, Zero-day attacks based on exploiting vulner-
abilities unknown to security experts pose a significant threat
in the healthcare IoT domain [11]. ML’s ability to recognize
patterns without relying on predefined signatures allows for
rapid identification of potential zero-day threats. This enables
swift responses and the implementation of countermeasures
to protect against emerging and previously unseen security
risks. Detailed research has been conducted on using the ML
model for zero-day attack detection [12] [13] [14]. Various
ML models, ranging from unsupervised ML and supervised
ML to Transfer Learning, are explored. In the study in [9],
the authors provide a detailed discussion about the different
concepts by uniting cybersecurity and ML.
F . Related Work
Several IoT systems were proposed for healthcare facilities
in hospitals. In [15], a real-time monitoring intensive care
unit (ICU) is proposed. The authors gave an interactive en-
vironment with suggestions for hardware and services offered
by the system. The system has yet to be made available for
clinical usage; it is currently in the testing and validation
stages. Additionally, there is still work to be done to secure
the communication channels and threat protection.
In [16] proposed a lab-created system for asthma patients
that suggests a method of measuring patients’ vital signs (such
as their temperature, respiration rate, and number of breaths)
that uses signal augmentation and watermarking techniques to
ensure secure data transmission. However, there are several
shortcomings in using commercial wearable IoT devices and
their inability to protect from DDoS attacks.
In [17], the authors suggest a brilliant description of a
cloud-based patient monitoring approach that gathers, stores,
processes, and visualizes IoT data that comprise the three
primary components of system security, where the vast amount
of IoT data, the sensing module uses variable sampling and
filtering. However, the architecture depends only on isolating
the traffic via separate gateways to secure the system.
In [18], a tremendous effort was made to survey the most
remarkable works on IoT implementation and their security
focus while highlighting and classifying the requirements into
confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authoriza-
tion, accountability, data freshness, non-repudiation; and dis-
cussing the resiliency requirement of reliability, Repair-ability,
adaptability, safety, and performance. Almost all the related
work focuses on one or more concerns of the IoT cybersecurity
for health care and follows the framework, shown in Fig. 4.TABLE I

reduction in computation overheads; however, it increases the
cost of the implementation dramatically.

III. A UTOENCODER
An artificial neural network called an autoencoder is utilized
for unsupervised learning or the efficient coding of unlabeled
input. An autoencoder [20] picks up two new skills: decoding,
which reconstructs the input data from the encoded represen-
tation, and encoding, which modifies the input data that is
very beneficial for zero-day attacks; the autoencoder structure
is shown in Fig. 5.
Fig. 5. Network Architecture for an abstract Autoencoder ML model.
Depending on the domain and use case, an autoencoder
design and the number of hidden layers vary, and the principal
model formula is listed below.
Φ + Ψ = arg min
ΦΨ||X−(Φ⊙Ψ)X′||2(1)where xis the input, x′is the output, Phi is the encoding
function Psi is the decoding function. The function that rep-
resents the variation between the input xand the reconstructed
input x′defines the reconstruction error. (2) and (3) illustrate
the usage of mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error
(MAE), two popular functions, to determine the reconstruction
error for a sample size of N.
MSE =NX
i=1(x′−x)2(2)
MAE =NX
i=1|x′−x| (3)
As it is noticed from the previous work and to the best of our
knowledge, there is no dedicated network security monitoring
(NSM) with intrusion prediction capabilities that was imple-
mented specifically targeting IoT system security. Keeping in
mind the fact that all security systems will eventually fail,
they were not monitored accordingly. Thus, in this work, we
propose a novel architecture tailored to IoT needs and a robust
implementation of IoT ML-based NSM devices.
IV. P ROPOSED ARCHITECTURE
The proposed system must inject the NSM concept into the
traditional IoT framework, providing a secure IoT architect
for Healthcare applications. In addition to crafting the novel
component into a simple add-on hardware device that could
be added to any exciting IoT healthcare implementation.
The proposed architecture consists of two main components:
the sensor monitor (SM) and the intrusion detection hub
(IDH). The SM unit consists of a miniature network sensing
device specialized in IoT traffic only by filtering all inbound
and outbound connections over the WiFi Network and Zigbee
signaling, limiting the captured traffic to the protocols listed
in Table II.

MQTT Lightweight publish-subscribe M2M TCP (1883, 8883)
XMPP Extensible Messaging Presence Protocol TCP (5269, 5280)
The SM and the IDH units are equipped with several anten-
nas to accommodate the most popular physical layer protocols
that will be used in healthcare IoT devices by 2023; the
currently supported protocol and the associated modules are
listed in Table III. Thanks to the modular design concept used
in our proposed architecture, the units can be simply modified,
adjusted and upgraded to any future signal technology. The
block diagram of the SM unite is demonstrated in Fig. 6.
The SM unit acts as an agent proxy to collect IoT filtered
traffic to the main security monitoring hub IDH, which consists

was trained for various IoT threats, inspired by the algorithm
presented in [13] autoencoder algorithm is used where an An
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) serves is the foundation,
and the network design, epoch count, and learning rate are
chosen for hyper-parameter optimization via the technique
described [21] and the number of layers and node was reduced
by 20% to accommodate the hardware implementation limits.
It is well known that random search converges to a semi-
optimal set of parameters more quickly than grid search. When
few criteria are required, it has also been demonstrated to
perform better than grid search and reduces the likelihood of
getting parameters that are over-fitted. For training, testing,
and verification, Initially, we used the dataset CICIoT2023’s
data from seven categories, namely DDoS, DoS, Recon, Web-
based, Brute Force, Spoofing, and Mirai. The input parameters
are flow duration, Header Length, Protocol Type, Duration,
Rate, Srate, Drate, flagnumber, ack count, syn count, fin count,
urg ount, rst count, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, Telnet, SMTP, SSH,
IRC, TCP, UDP, DHCP, ARP, ICMP, IPv, LLC, and Tot sum.
The input dataset was filtered for the outliers, and then the
.pcap files were processed to generate bidirectional traffic and
then saved into .csv file format. Finally, the dataset was divided
into 75% training and 25%.

The model was implemented in Python relying on Tensor-
Flow 2.10.1 and Keras 2.10 libraries, and it works as follows:
If the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original and
decoded instances is more than a certain threshold, the attack
instance is considered a zero-day attack. Based on heuristic
try and error, the system was tested for the range [0.05: 0.95]
as the parameter optimization; the value 0.15 was chosen to
converge the MSE; it is a crucial factor in determining the
value at which an instance is classified as a zero-day assault,where the convergence graph of 50 epochs is shown in Fig. 7.

The IDH unit is implemented using a Raspberry Pi 4B
to reduce the cost and power consumption. Where the pick
power consumption reached 7.5W at an accuracy up to 93.6%,

is produced by the minimal equivalent server gives the current
technology.
V. C OMPARISON AND DISCUSSION
We compared the proposed architecture to the most coupled
systems such as(Sys1) [17], (Sys2) [22], and (Sys3) [23]
and as the proposed method is novel and there was no
exact analogy as of our best knowledge. The accuracy, power
consumption, dataset, and hardware implementation were used
as comparison parameters. As shown in Table IV, the pro-
posed method’s accuracy exceeds the state-of-the-art hardware
implementation while competing with the software developed
that uses the same model approach but benefits from extra
hardware power.

The authors are aware that the system is performing with
93.6% mean accuracy with 82.1% worst-case scenario ac-
cording to the simulation, and we believe that with a more
extensive dataset, the standard deviation of the accuracy can
be further improved. Additionally, the power consumption is
relatively low; however, the module puts the SoC to operate
at 98% utilization, which can stress the hardware board if it
will be operating in high ambient temperature; however, in a
healthcare setup, this scenario is very unlikely.VI. C ONCLUSION
This study has thoroughly investigated the difficulties, re-
quirements, and creative solutions related to healthcare Inter-
net of Things (IoT) system security. The combination of IoT
and healthcare technology has the potential to revolutionize
patient care. Still, it also requires the use of cutting-edge
solutions and a thorough grasp of the complex cybersecurity
landscape. The proposed (ML)-based architecture strengthens
the security posture of Internet of Things (IoT) systems in the
healthcare industry. This architecture encompasses a range of
features, such as adaptive threat detection, real-time anomaly
detection, and predictive risk mitigation, while competing
with the full software-developed solutions and leading the
hardware-implemented stat-of-the-art with the accuracy of
93.6% with a low-cost solution that generates producing 4.7
mgCO 2only making the proposed solution and environment-
friendly architecture.
