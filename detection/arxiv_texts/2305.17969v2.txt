Abstract
We study the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics of dipolar polarons, i.e., impurities immersed in
a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, after a quench of the impurity-boson interaction. We show that
the dipolar nature of the condensate and of the impurity results in anisotropic relaxation dynamics,
in particular, anisotropic dressing of the polaron. More relevantly for cold-atom setups, quench
dynamics is strongly affected by the interplay between dipolar anisotropy and trap geometry. Our
findings pave the way for simulating impurities in anisotropic media utilizing experiments with
dipolar mixtures.

1 Introduction
Non-equilibrium dynamics is one of the most challenging and complex branches of quantum
many-body physics [1 –3]. One of its central questions is how a locally excited system reaches
an equilibrium state. A paradigmatic testbed for studies of this question is a mobile impurity
interacting with a quantum environment whose steady-state solution – a polaron [4] – provides
a physical intuition behind low-energy transport in semiconductors [5], colossal magnetoresis-
tance [6], non-equilibrium phenomena such as quantum heat transport [7] as well as polaron pairs
in semiconducting organic polymers [8]. Unfortunately, it appears challenging to experimentally
resolve time dynamics of the polaron in solid state systems, where natural timescales are ‘fast’,
often given by femtoseconds (for electrons) and picoseconds (for lattice).
To study time evolution of systems with impurities, one can use ultracold quantum gases
instead [9, 10], where, depending on the nature of the particles in the bath, impurities can form
Fermi [11 –14] or Bose polarons [15 –18]; the latter are in the focus of our study. By rapidly
populating the impurity state and probing its quench dynamics with radio frequency (RF) pulses,
current cold-atom experiments can unveil the relevant timescales of Bose-polaron formation and
provide insight into (i) how many-body impurity-bath correlations are built from the microscopic
level and (ii) how an initially excited bath thermalize due to dephasing of phonons. In particular, a
combination of a RF pulse that coherently populates the impurity state and Ramsey interferometry,
which tracks down the quantum evolution of the impurity coupled coherently to the BEC, allows one
to measure a time-dependent Green’s function, which contains information about non-equilibrium
dynamics of the impurity [9, 10]. Its imaginary part gives the contrast, namely the overlap between
the initial and the final states. It is one of the key observables studied in this work.
Complexity of quench dynamics of impurities stems in particular from the interplay between
few- and many-body correlations and the corresponding timescales. Initial dynamics involves a
local excitation of the system, which implies participation of phonons with high momenta that
can resolve few-body physics. After some time, the dynamics is mainly driven by propagation
of low-energy many-body excitations. In a three-dimensional Bose gas, these limiting cases and
the transition between them can be studied using several robust theoretical approaches based
upon variational coherent ansatz [19 –21], T-matrix approximation [22], Langevin equation [23],
master equation [24, 25], the many-body generalization of Weisskopf-Wigner theory [26], dynam-
ical variational ansatz [27], exact results [28]. [For impurities in a Fermi gas, see, for example,
Refs. [29 –31].] However, experimental and theoretical work on non-equilibrium polaron dynamics
is so far limited to ultracold gases with short-range interactions. The connection between the
far-from-equilibrium dynamics and the equilibrium polaron state remains an open problem for
more complicated interactions.
If the range of the potential is of the same order as the interparticle distance, the static prop-
erties of impurities are distinctly different from those for short-range interactions. For example,
Rydberg [32, 33] and ionic impurities [34, 35]1are dressed by many atoms and form many-body
1In the Rydberg case, the effective impurity-atom potential contains both s−andp−wave scattering terms. For a
charged impurity, the potential has an isotropic 1/r4tail.

bound states for strong interactions, which are beyond the so-called Fröhlich Hamiltonian [36, 37].
Another scenario is provided by an impurity in a dipolar gas [38, 39] where both the atom-atom
and impurity-atom potentials are characterized by a long-range and anisotropic dipole-dipole in-
teraction (DDI). The experimentally relevant interaction regimes of this system can be described
using the Fröhlich Hamiltonian, making the dipolar polaron model an ideal platform for simplified
theoretical studies of non-equilibrium dynamics in beyond-contact-interaction polaron models.
Motivated by the realization of bosonic mixtures of non-magnetic and magnetic atoms such
as Er-Li [40] and Yb-Er [41] as well as of magnetic atoms such as Er and Dy [42 –44], in this
work, we study non-equilibrium physics of dipolar polarons, i.e., impurities (non-dipolar or dipolar)
immersed in a Bose bath with dominant DDI. In stark contrast to systems ruled by short-range
interactions, the dispersion relation in dipolar systems displays an anisotropic behavior at low
energies [45, 46], supporting, for certain parameters, exotic states of matter such as quantum
droplets and supersolids [47, 48]. As we shall demonstrate, the anisotropy of dipolar interactions
also plays an important role in our study.
To investigate the quench dynamics of the impurity, we rely on a variational ansatz, see Sec. 3.
We establish closed-form expressions for the parameters that enter this ansatz (see appendicies) and
calculate the Ramsey contrast as the overlap between the non-interacting and the interacting states,
see Sec. 4. At long times, the contrast is determined by the steady-state properties of the system,
such as the polaron energy and the residue, and we start Sec. 4 by discussing these quantities.
Then, we unveil the relevant timescales of the polaron formation and demonstrate that they contain
information about the dipolar nature of the condensate, in particular, how far the system is from
the collapse, see Sec. 4.3. Note that the Ramsey contrast is an integral quantity and cannot be
used to study anisotropic nature of dipole-dipole interactions in a direct manner. Therefore, we
introduce a theoretical construct in Sec. 4.4 that allows us to perform such a study and to show that
3SciPost Physics Submission
time evolution of the system is highly anisotropic. Finally, we discuss an experimentally relevant
trapped case in Sec. 4.5.
For a non-dipolar impurity, our findings can be observed experimentally using well-established
interferometric techniques such as many-body Ramsey spectroscopy see, e.g., [9, 10] or by driving
Rabi oscillations between weakly and strongly interacting states [49]. In contrast, for the fully
dipolar case, further decoherence processes due to fast dipolar relaxation may play a role. We leave
an investigation of these effects to future studies.
2 System
We consider a highly imbalanced dipolar binary mixture at zero temperature. We first focus on
a uniform three-dimensional system, see Sec. 4.5 for a discussion of an experimentally relevant
trapped gas. The problem is cast in the framework of a single impurity problem interacting with a
dipolar condensate. The host bath is labeled by |1⟩with density nand the impurity is labeled by
|2⟩. For equal mass components, m1=m2=m, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the impurity
obeys the Fröhlich Hamiltonian,

. The first term of this
expression describes the short-range physics characterized by the coupling strength gij, which
within the Born approximation reads gij= 4πℏ2aij/m, where aijis the s-wave scattering length.
The second part contains the long-range DDI potential, which is anisotropic. Its strength is de-
termined by the dipolar coupling strength gd
ij=µ0µiµj/3 = 4 πℏ2p
didj/m, where µ0is the
vacuum permeability, and µi(j)is the magnetic dipolar moment related to the dipolar length di(j).
The anisotropy of the DDI implies that the velocity of Bogoliubov excitations depends on the di-
rection [50]. Figure 1 (a) depicts the anisotropic speed of sound c(θ)/c0=p
1 +ϵdd(3 cos2θ−1),
where ϵdd=d1/a11is the ratio between the dipolar and scattering lengths of the bath, and
c0=p
g11n/m is the sound velocity for the isotropic non-dipolar case ( ϵdd= 0). In the absence of
dipolar interactions, polaron formation time, which marks the onset of the final stage of the impurity
dynamics, is given by ξ/c0[25], where ξ=ℏ/(√
2c0)is the coherence length of a non-dipolar
condensate. If we naively define a direction-dependent timescale as ℏ2/(√
2c(θ)2)(see App. D for
a derivation of this timescale), then we shall expect slower dynamics in the side-to-side ( θ=π/2)
direction, which features the softest excitations in the system [50], than in the head-to-tail ( θ= 0)
one. This expectation is directly confirmed by our calculations, see Fig. 1 (b). The number of excited
bosons is also direction-dependent, as we discuss in Sec. 4.4. Note that excitations with momentum
perpendicular to the direction of dipoles ( θ=π/2) may be unstable [50], i.e., the speed of sound
may become imaginary, which leaves a trace in the dynamics of the impurity, as we show in Sec. 4.3.
To conclude the problem formulation, let us motivate the use of the Fröhlich approximation,
which is expected to be accurate only for weak interactions. As our focus is on the dynamics and de-
coherence of the impurity due to the interplay between the short and long-range anisotropic physics,

we shall only explore systems with aij≃di, i.e., the s-wave scattering length that determines the
short-range physics is comparable to the dipolar length of magnetic atoms. For Dy,d1≃130a0,
which for experimentally relevant densities implies a small gas parameter ( na3
1≪1), allowing us
to use the Fröhlich Hamiltonian as long as ϵdd<1, see also App. A.
3 Variational ansatz

where Ωk=ωk+ϵk−ℏk(P−PB)/m. The momentum of the bosons, PB=P

be neglected in our calculations (see below). In addition, we note that Eq. (2) should be regularized
(see the discussion in App. B).
4 Results
4.1 Steady state
First, we study static properties of the system with P= 0, by imposing in Eq. (2) the saddle-point
condition, i.e., ˙βk= 0. The corresponding solution is βk=−√nV12(k)Wk/(√
VΩk). Note that
βkis proportional to V12(k), thus, PBenters in the next-to-leading order (hierarchy is determined
by powers of V12). Therefore, PBshould not be considered when investigating the leading order
effects, validating the neglect of PBin our calculations.
Let us now consider the equation of motion for the phase ϕ. We identify the polaron energy
asE0=ℏ˙ϕ(t→ ∞ ), leading to E0=VΛ

. Therefore, the coherent-state variational ansatz in our calcula-
tions corresponds (approximately) to an ansatz based upon a single-phonon excitation. This means that our steady-state
results should be accurate at the level of second-order perturbation theory where perturbation is given by V12, see also
App. B where we calculate the energy perturbatively. Furthermore, as we focus on the Fröhlich Hamiltonian and our
ansatz describes (approximately) a one-phonon excitation, relaxation in quench dynamics should occur via dephasing of
the initially populated continuum of energy states (cf.Ref. [28]).

4.2 Ramsey contrast
We are interested in time evolution that follows an immersion of the impurity with P= 0in the
bath. This corresponds to an abrupt quench of V12from zero to a finite value. For a non-dipolar
impurity, this change can be realized using known experimental protocols, see, e.g, Ref. [10].
For a dipolar impurity, this could be done by first embedding the dipolar particle initially in the
non-magnetic m= 0state, at a magnetic field such that a12= 0, and then transferring the impurity
to the (maximally stretched) magnetic state of lowest Zeeman energy. This procedure would also
result in this case to the desired abrupt switching-on of V12.
To illustrate time evolution, we evaluate the contrast, i.e., the overlap between the polaron
wave function and the initial state, S(t) =⟨ψ(0)|ψ(t)⟩, where the initial state corresponds to a
phononic vacuum and an impurity with P= 0, i.e.,|ψ(0)⟩=|0k,0⟩. Note that S(t)does not
contain any information about the directional dependence of the dynamics. It is an experimentally
relevant observable that contains only the information averaged over the sample. For the coherent
variational ansatz, the contrast takes a simple form

are auxiliary functions, see App. B. The characteristic timescale tn=m
8πnℏa11describes time evolution of a non-dipolar Bose gas at the mean-field level. As tn∼ξ/c0, we
interpret it as the timescale for a phonon to pass the region of the condensate distorted by the
impurity. Note that it is natural to expect that tndefines polaron formation time, and as we show in
the next subsection this is indeed the case. Indeed, assuming that the initial state contains excited
phonons next to the impurity, polaron formation time is determined as the time needed for these
phonons to leave the vicinity of the impurity, which is approximately tn[25,54]. For the considered
parameters tn∼0.1ms.

which is determined only by low-energy two-body impurity-boson scattering and the density of the
bosons, and does not contain any information about the boson-boson interactions. Our approach
does not allow us to access the unitarity-limited universal dynamics [10, 55]. These dynamics
can however be observed in current experiments only with strongly interacting gases making it
irrelevant for our study.

To illustrate the time evolution of the contrast for intermediate times, we shall first consider the
system in a box potential, for which the density of the Bose gas is uniform.
4.3 Homogeneous case
We consider the scenario where a11≳d1, which corresponds to a stable system with dynamics
strongly affected by dipole-dipole interactions. At t <0,V12= 0; att= 0, the impurity-bath
interaction is turned on, initiating the quench dynamics. Figure 2 (a) depicts the amplitude and

phase of the contrast as a function of time for a typical gas parameter na3
11= 5×10−5. Following
Refs. [10, 56], we distinguish two regimes of the dynamics, namely, the two-body “relaxation”
and the many-body “polaron formation”, which for a non-dipolar impurity can be accessed exper-
imentally by using interferometric techniques. During the initial “relaxation”, which occurs for
t≪tn, mainly two-body collisions between the impurity and the bath are relevant. Such two-body
processes dominate the dynamics for times on the order of tenths of µs for typical experimental
conditions, cf. the dashed curve in Fig. 2 (a).
In Fig. 2 (b), we present the time evolution of the contrast (4), and the instantaneous polaron
energy, defined as E(t) =ℏ˙ϕ(t). Time evolution of E(t)reflects formation of excitations in the
system via the following identity (see App. C):
E(t) =nV12(0)−1
2X
k(ωk+ϵk)|βk|2, (8)
which connects E(t)to the energy deposited to the medium and impurity states. The latter states
are populated via recoil due to the conservation of momentum in phonon-impurity scattering. Ac-
cording to Eq. (8), E(t= 0)≥E(t)in agreement with Fig. 2 (b). In the “relaxation” regime, the
energy of the system decreases as a function of time due to the energy exchange (dephasing) with
the bosonic bath. For t∼tn, the system is in the “formation” region where collective excitations of
the Bose gas are building up the quasiparticle. For t≫tnthe polaron is formed – its instantaneous
energy is the steady-state energy, E0; the absolute value of the contrast is the quasiparticle residue.
In Fig. 3 (a), we plot |S(t)|as a function of time for different values of ϵdd<1(recall that
forϵdd= 1the system is unstable against 3D collapse). Firstly, we consider the case a11=a12.
We tune ϵddby changing a11for fixed d1=d2. For a11=a12andd1=d2, the boson-boson
and boson-impurity interactions as well as the functions z(u)andω(u)are identical. This implies
values of the residue close to unity even for ϵdd→1, see Eq. (7). As ϵdddecreases, i.e., the
bath becomes less dipolar, the quasiparticle residue also decreases. This happens due to the in-
crease of a11, which makes the bath more strongly interacting, rendering the dynamics lesscoherent.
In Fig. 3 (b), we present |S(t)|fora11= 2a12. In this case, the residue vanishes in the limit
ϵdd→1due to a slow logarithmic divergence of the integral in Eq. (7). Vanishing residue leads to
a number of differences in comparison to the previously discussed symmetric case. In particular,
forϵdd≈1, the absolute value of the contrast approaches the result of Eq. (7) at timescales much
longer than the typical timescales of polaron formation, t≃tn. By analyzing the function R(t/tn),
we conclude that for ϵdd≈1long-time dynamics of the contrast is of the form

which allows us to introduce a relevant timescale close to the collapse: tϵ=tn/(1−ϵdd); Eq. (9) is
valid for t≫tϵand√d1d2̸=ϵdda12. The timescale tϵunderlies the very slow dynamics of |S(t)|
and of the instantaneous polaron energy as ϵdd→1. We illustrate this slowdown in the inset of
Fig. 3 (b).
4.4 Anisotropy of time evolution
Up to now, we have considered quantities integrated over all directions, which cannot show the
anisotropy of the time evolution. However, in general, the impurity experiences direction-dependent

affected more strongly in the radial direction (unless V12is also vanishing in this direction), which
is further reflected in the values of the radial and axial effective masses in the steady state, see
App. B. The latter effective mass is always weakly renormalized, while the former increases rapidly,
implying slow diffusion in the radial direction.
To quantify the discussion above, and to illustrate the slowing-down of the radial dynamics
compared to the axial dynamics, we study the number of excitations as a function of the angle:
B(θ) =P
k′|βk′|2δ(cos(θ)−cos(θ′))where k′={k′, θ′, ϕ′}is the integration index:

This function features different timescales for different angles, see Fig. 1 (b), demonstrating that the
time evolution of the dipolar polaron is drastically different from what is expected for short-range
interactions. Physical insight into the anisotropy can be gained by considering the short-time
dynamics, i.e., t≪tn. In this limit, we derive B(θ)≃q

The timescale tθ
Fdepends on the angle, showing the difference in the dynamics parallel and perpen-
dicular to the dipolar moment. One striking example is the dynamics with a12=√d1d2, which
leads to weak interactions for θ=π/2and consequently tθ→π/2
F→ ∞ [cf. the bottom panel of
9SciPost Physics Submission
Fig. 1 (b)].
Note that the anisotropy of tθ
Fis due to the dipolar nature of the impurity, and vanishes if we
assume that d2= 0[compare the two curves in the top panel of Fig. 1 (b) at t→0]. For longer
times, the anisotropy of the dynamics is also driven by the anisotropy of the medium. It exists even
ifd2= 0, provided that d1̸= 0. This can be shown using βkfrom the saddle point approximation.
The existence of the anisotropy for d2= 0can be also anticipated from the directional dependence
of the effective mass, see App. B.
Finally, we mention another manifestation of anisotropy of time evolution that could be ob-
served if the velocity of the impurity is close to the speed of sound. In this case, there is a “critical
slowdown” dynamics (not to be confused with the slowdown presented in the inset of Fig. 3 (b)
due to ϵdd→1) [25]. In the non-dipolar case, the impurity exhibits a “critical slowdown” near the
critical momentum pc=mc0. In the dipolar case, the speed of sound is direction dependent, hence,
we expect that the “slowdown” occurs when the impurity momentum resonates with a specific
sound mode in a particular direction. Therefore, the impurity will experience the “slowdown” more
readily (i.e., for smaller values of the momentum of the impurity) in the radial direction – the effect
will be particularly strong if ϵddis close to one.
4.5 Trapped system
As we have shown, many properties of dipolar impurities in the homogeneous system can be
understood (at least at the qualitative level) from the case with zero-range interactions by simply
assuming that the s-wave scattering length depends on the direction. The physics of the problem
becomes more intricate in the presence of inhomogeneous trapping, due to a possible interplay
between the trap geometry and the anisotropy of the interaction. To illustrate this, we use the
local-density approximation to study the experimentally relevant case of a system in a harmonic
trap, see, e.g., [43]. We assume that the dipolar condensate is confined by the external potential
V(ρ, z) =1
2mω2

λ2ρ2+z2
, with dipoles pointing along the z-direction, λ=ωρ/ωz, and study
the role of different geometries on the dynamics of the contrast. For simplicity, we assume that the
impurity does not experience any external potential.
In Fig. 4 (a) we present the amplitude and the phase of the contrast averaged over the Bose
gas confined by a cigar-shaped ( λ= 0.1), and a spherical ( λ= 1) traps, which correspond to
(ωρ, ωz) = 2 π(50,500)Hz and(ωρ, ωz) = 2 π(500,500)Hz , respectively. To calculate the contrast,
we rely on the local-density approximation ( n→n(r)):

∆ = lz/lρ. The last term in Eq. (14) originates from the local polaron energy at the level of first
order perturbation theory (see App. E for more details). The interplay between the dipole-dipole
interaction and the geometry of the potential enters Eq. (14) via the term√d1d2κ. By changing the
shape of the trap one varies κin the range [−1,2], and consequently the energy exchange between
the impurity and the bath, see Fig. 4, which illustrates distinctly different approaches to the steady
states for the two values of λ. Note that in the limiting case a12=−√d1d2κ(lρ/lz), the average
polaron energy at the mean-field level vanishes, slowing down the dynamics. This regime amplifies
the importance of the√
tterm and beyond-mean-field effects (see Eq. (14)) in a dipolar mixture,
suggesting the contrast as a probe of novel physics.
The local-density approximation utilized above is accurate only if the impurity can explore
a small region of space. This assumption is adequate for studies of time evolution on timescales
given by tn∼0.1ms (compare with timescales for the dynamics in the trap 2π/¯ω≃2ms). Time

evolution of the impurity cloud at longer times deserves a further investigation. To motivate it,
we present in Fig. 4(b) the local polaron energy E0(r)(see App. E) for λ= 0.1andλ= 1. We
see that in the former case the energy of the impurity is minimized when it is expelled from the
condensate. In the latter case, the impurity prefers to localize outside the condensate along the
z-axis (cf. Ref. [57]).
4.6 Summary and Outlook
We studied steady-state properties and quench dynamics of an impurity atom in a dipolar Bose-
Einstein condensate. We solved Eq. (2) that determines a coherent-state variational ansatz employed
to describe the system. Using our solution, we derived and analyzed a semi-analytical expression
for the Ramsey contrast, see Eq. (4). In particular, we calculated short- and long-time dynamics of
the contrast that elucidate initial few-body dynamics and approach of the system to the quasiparticle
limit, see Eqs. (5) and (9). Furthermore, we proposed and illustrated a quantity suitable for studying
anisotropic time evolution driven by dipole-dipole interactions, see Sec. 4.4. Finally, we employed
a local-density approximation to analyze an experimentally relevant trapped system and showed
that the dynamics of the system depends strongly on the shape of the trap, contrasting the system
under consideration with cold-atom impurity systems where only contact interactions are important.
In this work the host medium is a Bose-Einstein condensate, however, our results can be easily
extrapolated to impurities immersed in an isolated droplet or in a dipolar supersolid. A possible
interesting future direction is to study the polaron dynamics across the superfluid-to-supersolid tran-
sition using dipolar or non-dipolar impurities embedded in dipolar media [58,59]. This transition is
expected to have an unusual phase diagram [60], and the impurity dynamics may provide a tool to
probe it.
Another direction is to consider multiple dipolar polarons and their interactions induced by the
medium. In contrast to systems with short-range interactions [61 –63], the anisotropic nature of
the dipole-dipole potential will induce anisotropic correlations between impurities. These can be
observed experimentally for example by studying the anisotropy of the impurity cloud in quench
dynamics (cf. Ref. [64]).
Finally, we note that dipolar polarons in quantum gases may provide a valuable insight into out-
of-equilibrium dynamics of indirect excitons modelled as electric dipoles. Interaction and trapping
in these solid-state systems can be controlled, making it possible to study out-of-equilibrium
dipolar excitons in atomically thin semiconductors [65]. These systems garner significant attention
due to their unique optical properties, and their quantum simulation may not only deepen our
understanding of dipolar excitations, but also lead to novel technological applications.

To investigate the effects of beyond-Fröhlich physics, let us consider the terms that describe other
relevant scattering processes such as

The upper (lower) sign corresponds to V(1)

equations for the parameters βk, which appear in our variational ansatz,

The equation for ϕ(t)remain unchanged.
The last two terms in Eq. (A.3) describe the beyond-Fröhlich-Hamiltonian physics. Note that
their effect is next-to-leading order (in powers of V12) because the source term,√nV12(k)Wk/√
V,
forβkis proportional to√nV12, which is a small parameter for experimentally relevant densities.
Therefore, these terms can be neglected in our work (at least within our variational approach), as
the properties that we calculate are determined by |βk|2. Note that the beyond-Fröhlich terms are
important for the case |aij| ≫di, which can be described using frameworks developed to study
non-dipolar polarons.
B Static properties of the system
Below, we provide four appendices with technical detials that support results presented in the main
text. In App. B, we compute the polaron properties, including its energy, quasiparticle residue,
and effective mass. The energy will later enter as an input in the calculation of the contrast. The
energy is computed using second-order perturbation theory with either the bare impurity-boson
perturbing potential or the renormalized one derived by excluding high-energy momentum states.
In App. C we provide technical details for Eq. (2) of the main text. In App. D, we derive the
analytical expression for the contrast, see Eq. (4) of the main text. In App. E, we assume a Gaussian
density profile of the Bose gas to compute the energy in a trapped case. This allows us to highlight
the underlying effects in polaron’s dynamics in a trap.
1. Lee-Low-Pines transformation (LLPt). In impurity problems, a transformation to the co-
moving frame of the impurity is customary and simplifies the calculations. We transform the

3. Regularized potential. In the previous section, we computed the polaron energy using
bare potentials. Alternatively, we could have used a regularized potential for these calculations.
To find forms of the regularized potentials, we note that a dipolar Bose gas within a mean-
field approximation can be described with the potential from the first Born approximation, see,
e.g., [66 –68]. Therefore, as long as we focus on a weakly-interacting Bose gas, our expression for
V11is accurate. For any beyond mean-field calculations, this potential clearly fails, as can be seen
by solving a few-body problem already with gd
ij= 0, see, e.g., Ref. [69]. Therefore, we need to
suggest an effective description for V12.
For our purposes, the effective interaction follows from the first and second terms in Born
approximation. Using V12=4πℏ2

In the limit of d2→0(non-dipolar) impurity these expressions reproduce the results presented
in [38], providing us with another benchmark of our variational approach.
We identify three limiting cases: d1= 0 and arbitrary d2;d1̸= 0 andd2= 0;d1̸= 0 and
d2̸= 0. As expected, the effective masses mxandmzfrom Eq. (B.19) are identical if the medium
is isotropic, i.e., mx=mzifd1= 0. The difference between mxandmzfor a non-dipolar
impurity d2→0(a12/d2≫1) ifd1̸= 0has been discussed in Ref. [38]. For a dipolar gas and a
dipolar impurity, our results show that if√d1d2≃a12the effective masses are strongly affected by
the dipole moments of both the impurity and bosons. To illustrate these limiting cases, we calculate
the effective masses for Dysprosium atoms assuming a11= 130 .041a0andn= 1020m−3. The
value of a11is chosen such that the system is stable, i.e., V11is always positive. In Fig. S2, we show
the effective masses for (i) the contact case ( d1=d2= 0); (ii) a dipolar medium with a contact
impurity ( d2= 0, d1= 130 a0); (iii) a dipolar medium with a dipolar impurity ( d1=d2= 130 a0).

We see that the mass mzis only weakly affected by the dipolar nature of the interaction, whereas mx
is strongly modified. This strong modification may be observed by means of momentum-resolved
Bragg spectroscopy, thus, the effective mass anisotropy that we discuss here might be accessible
within current experimental resolutions. Finally, let us analyze what happens in the limit ϵdd→1,
i.e., in the vicinity of the collapse of the Bose gas. The effective mass mzstays finite even if
ϵdd= 1. The mass mxhowever diverges. One can show that m/m x−1∼ln(1−ϵdd).
Finally, we discuss the effect of self-localization (strong modification of the effective mass)
that is predicted using the mean-field strong-coupling ansatz [70, 71] (see also [72] for an attractive
impurity in a trap) on our results. For a non-dipolar system, the defining dimensionless parameter
for this localization is√
16πna2
12/√a11[70], which is of the order of 0.1for the parameters used
in our work. [Note that self-localization might occur only if this parameter is much larger than one.]
Let us now speculate what happens for a dipolar system. To this end, we analyze a naive extension
of the parameter above√
16πn[a12+d1(3 cos2(θ)−1)]2/p
a11+d1(3 cos2(θ)−1), where we
assumed that d1=d2. By estimating this parameter, we conclude that self-localization may occur
only if a12̸=a11and if ϵdd≃0.999(for the considered values of the density and scattering
lengths). Therefore, the self-localization effect does not affect the main findings of our study, and
we leave its further investigation in dipolar systems for a future research. That research could rely
on the mean-field ansatz in a co-moving frame [73 –77], which (unlike the strong-coupling ansatz)
allows one to study a strong modification of the density of the Bose gas preserving translational
invariance of the problem.
C Derivation of Eq. (2)
For a non-dipolar case, Eq. (2) has been derived before [19]. For a dipolar case, the derivation
is analogous. Here, we outline only a derivation of the equation for ϕ, which follows fromD
ψ(t)iℏ∂t−ˆHψ(t)E
= 0, see, e.g., Ref. [63].
First, we compute the expectation value of the time derivative
⟨ψ(t)|iℏ∂t|ψ(t)⟩=ℏ˙ϕ+iℏXh
˙βk(t)β∗

where we have used the following properties of coherent states: ⟨ψ(t)|bk|ψ(t)⟩=βkand
⟨ψ(t)|b†

k. Also it is convenient to use that D(α+β) =D(α)D(β)e(αβ∗−α∗β)/2,
where D(β) =eβb†−β∗bwhen calculating the derivative of a coherent state.
Second, we compute the expectation value of the Hamiltonian
⟨ψ(t)|ˆH|ψ(t)⟩=(P−PB)2

k(ωk+ϵk)|βk|2+nV12(0) + 2rn

(C.2)
where PB=Pk|βk|2; we used that V12(k)Wk=V12(−k)W−kandD†(β)b†D(β) =b†+β∗.
To proceed, we use the equation for βkpresented in the main text

This equation leads to Eq. (2) of the main text. Note that the terms proportional to PPBvanish,
and only the terms proportional to P2
Bare relevant. However, these terms are the next-to-leading
order and can be neglected in our calculations, as we discuss in the main text.
Distribution of the energies in the system for P= 0.We can use Eq. (C.2) to understand the
dynamics of the energy in the system initiated in the ground state, i.e., with P= 0, which also
implies that PB= 0asβk=β−k. First of all note that we have ⟨ψ(t)|ˆH|ψ(t)⟩=nV12(0), i.e.,
thetotal energy is independent of time as it should. To show this conservation law, one can use
the explicit solution to Eq. (C.3): βk(t) =V12(k)√n√

is not to be confused with the energy of the polaron, E(t), associated with ℏ˙ϕ. Its expression,
E(t) =nV12(0)−1
2P
k(ℏωk+ϵk)|βk|2, was presented in the main text.
Let us provide some physical intuition for the terms in Eq. (C.2). The termP
k(ℏωk+ϵk)|βk|2
is the energy of excitations created during the dynamics. Note that a phonon is always accompanied
by an excited state of an impurity. Indeed, recoil of the impurity is required by the conservation of
the total momentum and explains the appearance of the combination (ℏωk+ϵk)in the sum. The last
term in Eq. (C.2) is always negative (or zero). It describes the energy stored in the boson-impurity
interaction.
D Derivation of contrast

from Eq. (2), we write ϕ(t)as

account here. The second integral I2(t)can be written as

a non-dipolar condensate, tnis the time required for a phonon to travel through the region of the
condensate distorted by the impurity. Indeed, tn≃ξ/c0, where the healing length ξdefines the

of time evolution is encoded in the prefactor ¯Ωx, which effectively leads to a direction-dependent
speed of sound, c(θ).
The auxiliary functions z(u)andw(u)are defined in Eq. (B.5). The integrand appearing in
Eq. (D.5) can be written as a primitive function and simplified further by using the procedure
