 1. INTRODUCTION   
In the general cas e, an arithmetic function is a function defined on the set of natural 
numbers and taking values on the set of complex numbers. The name arithmetic function is due 
to the fact that this function expresses some arithmetic property of the natural series.  
 A multiplicative arithmetic function is an arithmetic function for which:  
   
1 2 1 2( ) ( ) ( )g m m g m g m , 
where 
1m , 
2m are coprime numbers.  
             Let a natural number 
m have a canonical decomposition 
1
1...ta a
t m p p , where 
ip is a 
prime number and 
i is a natural number. Then, it is holds for the multiplicative arithmetic 
function:

A strongly multiplicative arithmetic function is an arithmetic function for which is true - 
**( ) ( )g p g p
. Therefore, based on (1.1), it is executed for a strongly multiplicative arith metic 
function:

 The summation function

Let's look at the summation  function  from  the restricted arithmetic function, i.e. 
| ( ) |f m C
at  
1,...,mn . 
If 
1C , then take 
( ) ( ) /g m f m C , for 
1,...,mn , for which 
| ( ) | 1gm . Theref ore, if

 Further, if

| ( ) | 1gm , then 
according to the Wirzing theorem  [1]:

  Taking into account (1.6), we will further consider only the case with 
| ( ) | 1, 1,...,g m m n
. 
 An example of a summation function f rom a bounded  multiplicative arithmetic function 
is the Mertens function:  
   
( ) ( )
mnM n m 
 ,         (1.7) 
where 
()m is the Möbius function, where the Möbius function 
( ) 1m if the natural number m 
has an even number of prime divisors of the first degree, 
( ) 1m if the natural number m has 
an odd number of prime divisors of the first degree, and 
( ) 0m if the natural number m has 
prime divisors not only of the first degree.  
 Finding the asymptotic behavior of summation functions from  bounded multiplicative 
arithmetic functions is an important problem in number theory [1 -3]. This work is devoted to 
solving this problem.  
 2. ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR OF SUMMATION FUNCTIONS FR OM A BOUNDED 
MULTIPLICATIVE ARITHMETIC FUNCTIONS  
  The assertion was proved in [4].

 Assertion  1  
 Let 
| ( ) | 1, 1,...,g m m n is a real multiplicative arithmetic function, then the relation is 
true for the summation function:  
01 ( )( ) ( ) (1 ) ( )
m n pgpS n g m n o npp

      
, 
where the infinite product is considered to be 0 if the product diverges.  
 Let us consider several consequences of Asser tion 1.  
 Assertion  2 
 Let 
| ( ) | 1, 1,...,g m m n is a real multiplicative arithmetic function, then if the series 
1 ( )
pgp
p
 (converges), then the infinite product converges and the asymptotic of the 
summation function is equal to:  
   
01 ( )( ) (1 ) ( )
m n pgpg m n o npp

      .      (2.1)  
 If the series 
1 ( )
pgp
p  (diverges), then the infinite product (2.1) tend s to zero, and 
the asymptotic of the summation function is equal to:  
( ) ( )
mng m o n

.         (2.2)   
 Proof  
We write the infinite product in the form:

ppg p g p g p g p
p p p p

      
         (2.3)  
 Taking into account that 
| ( ) | 1, 1gp , then each term of the infinite product (2.3) 
tends to 1 as at 
p . Therefore, starting from some
N , each term of the infinite product is 
positive and the product can be taken as a logarithm:  5

p N p N p N p Ng p g p g p g p g pOOp p p p p p                .(2.4)  
 Since the series 
21
pp converges, if the series 
1 ( )
pgp
p converges, then the series 
1 ( )
pNgp
p
converges and the series (2.4) converges. Therefore, in this case, the infinite pro duct 
converges:  
2
21 ( ) ( ) ( )(1 ...)
pNg p g p g p
pp  
      (2.5)  
and also the infinite product (2.3). Therefore, by Assertion 1, (2.1) holds.  
 If the series 
1 ( )
pgp
p  (diverges), then the series (2.4) diverges to 
 , and th e 
infinite products (2.5) and (2.3) tend to zero. Therefore, by Assertion 1, (2.2) holds.  
 An example for assertions 1 and 2.  
Let's find the asymptotic of the Mertens function
( ) ( )
mnM n m 
 . 
It is known that 
( ), 1,...,m m n is a mul tiplicative arithmetic function and 
| ( ) | 1m , 
therefore, assertion  1 can be used to find the indicated asymptotic.  
Since 
( ) 1, ( ) 0pp  at 
1 , then

Having in mind  that 
21(1 ) 0
pn p , therefore, we can take the logarithm of the product:  
22
21 1 1 1ln( (1 ) ) ln(1 ) 2 ( ) 2ln ln (1).
p n p n p n p nO n Op p p p            
 
Therefore, the asymptotic  of the product will be equal to:

Then the infinite product will be equal to:  6

 Taking this into account, based on Assertion  1, the asymptotic of the Mertens function 
will be equal to:  
( ) ( ) ( )
mnM n m o n 

 Now we use Assertion 2.  
The series 
1 ( ) 1 ( 1) 2

 The second proof is shorter.   
 The zeta function of primes was considered in [5]. It is defined as the following infinite 
series converging for Re(s) > 1:  
1()s

p is a prime number.  
 The zeta function of primes is related to the Riemann zeta function

             Assertion  3 
 Let

  The asymptotic of the summation function through the Riemann zeta function under the

 There is no term

 Having in mind  (2.7) and (2.1 5) we obtain the asymptotic of the summation function in

 Assertion  4 
 Let it will be

The proof follows from the definition of a strongly multiplicative arithmetic function

 Let's take an example of assertions  3 and 4.

3. ASYMPTOTIC OF THE NUMBER OF NATURAL NUMBERS SATISFYING 
CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS  
 The number of natural numbers that meet certain requirements is a summation function of 
the form 
1 ( )
mnm
 , where 
1 ( )m is an arithmetic indicator function. 
1 ( ) 1m , if 
m , 
where
  is a set of natural numbers that satisfies certain requirements, otherwise 
1 ( ) 0m . 
 We consider hear only the case when the indicator arithmetic function 
1 ( )m is 
multiplicative.  10 
 The simplest multiplicative arithmetic indicator function is the arithmetic function 
()m  
(
( ) 1m  , if 
1m and
( ) 0m , if
1m  ). It is clear that  
( ) 1
mnm
 . 
Another multiplicative arithmetic indicator function is the arithmetic function 
1( )m  
(
1( ) 1m for any value
m ). It's clear that  
1( )
mnmn
 . 
Anoth er example of an indicator from a multiplicative arithmetic function is square -free 
natural numbers (this is a set of natural numbers 
 whose decomposition into a product of 
powers of prime numbers contains only the first powers, i .e. 
m , if 
12...k m p p p ). 
The number of natural numbers not greater than 
n , which are free from squares, is 
usually denoted by 
12...( ) 1( )

m p p pQ n m

 Taking into account that 
()gm = 
1 ( )m is a multiplicative function in this case and 
| ( ) | 1gm
, then as 
1 ( ) 1 1
ppgp

Assertion  2 and the Euler identity.

. (3.1)  
             Based on (3.1), the asymptotic of the number of natural numbers not exceeding 
n , 
which are not free from squares, i.e. the expansion of which into a product of powers of primes 
contains not o nly the first powers (we denote 
_()Qn ), is defined as:

            Let's look at another example of determining the asympt otic of the number of natural 
numbers that satisfy certain requirements, when the indicator arithmetic function is 
multiplicative.  
             This is an arithmetic function
 ()g m powerful m . The value of 
1 powerful m  , if 
1m
or in the factorization of a natural number
12
1 2 1 2 ... , 1, 1,..., 1k
kk m p p p        , 11 
 otherwise - 
0 powerful m  . It is easy to verify that the arithmetic function 
 powerful m is 
real and multiplicative.  
 It is clear that the natural numbers for which 
1 powerful m  is less than the numbers 
not free from squares (3.2). How much less?  
 Let us determine the asymptotic of the number of natural numbers,                    where  
1 powerful m 
, using Assertion 1.  
 Having in mind that 
( ) 0, ( ) 1, 1g p g p    we get:

             Naturally, estimate (3.7) is not exact. An accurate estimate can be obtained using 
complex analysis methods [7]. However, this estimate is suitable  for qualitative analysis. Let us 
compare, for example, the asymptotic estimates for two arithmetic functions (3.2) and (3.7).

functions.
