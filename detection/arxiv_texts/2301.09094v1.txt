Abstract
Turnpike phenomena of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian descrip tor systems under
minimal energy supply are studied. Under assumptions on the smoothness of the
system nonlinearities, it is shown that the optimal control problem is dissipative with
respect to a manifold. Then, under controllability assumpt ions, it is shown that the
optimal control problem exhibits a manifold turnpike prope rty.
Keywords: turnpike phenomenon, nonlinear systems, port-H amiltonian systems
1 Introduction
This paper is concerned with turnpike phenomena . These phenomena were ﬁrst noticed in
the context of economics [5,17] and have since been observed in many different situations,
see, e.g., [3, 28, 36] and the references therein. Usually, t urnpike phenomena are studied
in optimal control problems, where the goal is the minimizat ion of a cost functional C(u).
Here, the function uacts as the control of a system of interest. In many cases, it c an
be observed that an optimal control u∗will, for a majority of the time horizon, steer the
associated state trajectory x∗to a point [23, 24, 30], a set [25, 28, 36] or, as in our case, a
manifold [7]. In other words, optimal solutions depend main ly on the underlying system
and the optimization objective and are more or less independ ent on the choice of the time
horizon and other data, such as initial or ﬁnal values. The be haviour is reminiscent of an
observation from daily life: when traveling a long distance by car, it is usually faster to
take a detour via a turnpike than to choose a more direct way on slower streets. Also, the
chosen turnpike usually does not heavily depend on the start and end of the route. If one
would start the journey a few blocks away, then the fastest pa th would remain more or
less the same.
Here, we consider a special class of systems called port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems.
Parts of the origins of port-Hamiltonian systems date back t o the late 1950s [21], and the
interested reader is referred to [31] for an overview on the o rigins of this system class.
Despite their long history, they continue to be the focus of a ctive research [2, 10, 14, 18,
19, 32]. Arguably, the key feature of pHsystems is their modeling perspective: they

1focus on taking energy as the lingua franca between subsystems. As a consequence, the
class of pHsystems is a promising class for modeling real world process es [18]. Beneﬁts
of port-Hamiltonian models include inherent stability and passivity, the invariance under
Galerkin projection and congruence transformation, and th e possibility to interconnect
multiple pHsystems in a structure-preserving manner.
When pHsystems are considered in an optimal control setting, the ob jective of min-
imizing the supplied energy is quite natural. This results i n a cost term of the form/integraltextT
0y(t)Tu(t)dt, where yis a collocated observation of the system, and renders the co rre-
sponding optimal control problem singular. In [9,26], the a uthors have considered this ob-
jective for linear time invariant port-Hamiltonian (descr iptor) systems. They have shown
that the optimal control problem has a measure turnpike prop erty with respect to the dis-
sipative part of the state space, given by the kernel of the ma trix corresponding to the
non-conservative system dynamics. The inﬁnite-dimension al linear case was discussed
in [22]. In this paper, we are concerned with the ﬁnite-dimen sional nonlinear case. We
show that, under smoothness assumptions on the nonlinearit ies and controllability as-
sumptions on the system, nonlinear pHdescriptor systems admit a turnpike phenomenon
with respect to a submanifold of Rn. This submanifold corresponds, as in the linear case,
to the energy dissipating part of the state space.
The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we rec all the deﬁnition of
port-Hamiltonian systems and precisely state the optimal c ontrol problem that is consid-
ered. After that, a short repetition of results on submanifo lds ofRnfollows in Section 3.
In Section 4, we deﬁne manifold dissipativity and manifold t urnpikes following [7] and
recall that, under weak assumptions, manifold dissipativi ty implies a manifold turnpike
property. Section 5 contains the main results of this work, w here the previously estab-
lished results are applied to ﬁnite-dimensional nonlinear port-Hamiltonian descriptor sys-
tems. The theoretical results are then illustrated by a nume rical example in Section 6.
Finally, in Section 7 a conclusion is drawn and an outlook on f uture research is given.
Notation
For a set Z⊆Rnwe deﬁne Z◦as the interior of Z. We denote the Euclidean norm
by/bardbl·/bardbl and deﬁne the distance of a point x∈Rnto the set M ⊆Rnas dist(x,M):=
infp∈M/bardblx−p/bardbl. We denote the set of all k-times continuously differentiable functions
from UtoVbyCk(U,V)and deﬁne C(U,V):=C0(U,V). When the spaces UandVare
clear from context, we say that f∈Ck(U,V)is of class Ck. The derivative of a function f
at point xis denoted by D fx. Further, for a matrix A∈Rn,nwe write A/{ollowsequal0 ifxTAx≥0
for all x∈Rn, and A≻0 ifxTAx>0 for all x∈Rn\{0}, where·Tdenotes the transpose.
The kernel and range of the matrix Aare denoted by ker (A)and ran(A), respectively. The
non-negative square-root of a positive semideﬁnite matrix Ais denoted by A1/2. Often,
we surpress the time dependency of functions and write zinstead of z(t).
22 Preliminaries and problem setting
Following the deﬁniton of [18], we consider nonlinear port- Hamiltonian descriptor sys-
tems of the form
E(x)˙x=(J(x)−R(x))η(x)+B(x)u,
y=B(x)Tη(x).(pH)
Here, x,uandyare the state, input and output of the system, respectively. We restrict our
analysis to pHsystems without feedthrough but note that the discussion ca n be extended
to systems with a feedthrough term as introduced in [18]. We c onsider the state space
X=Rnand a set of admissible controls Uadand require that
E,J,R∈C(X,Rn,n),η∈C(X,Rn)and B∈C(X,Rn,m).
Further, the functions JandRhave to satisfy J(x)=−J(x)TandR(x)=R(x)T/{ollowsequal0 for all
x∈X. We assume that the system ( pH) is associated with a Hamiltonian H ∈ C1(X,R)
which is bounded from below along any solution of ( pH) and satisﬁes
d
dxH(x)=E(x)Tη(x)
for each x∈X. Without loss of generality, as in [18] we may assume that His nonnegative
along any solution of ( pH).
Remark 1. We only consider pHsystems which do not explicitly depend on time. The
deﬁnition given here can be generalized to include explicit time dependence, but these
systems can easily be made autonomous [18, Remark 4.2].
When it comes to the optimal control of port-Hamiltonian sys tems, the cost functional
should take into account that pHsystems stem from using energy as the lingua franca.
Hence, choosing the supplied energy as the optimization obj ective is quite natural. For
this, usually the impedance supply yTuis considered, which is related to the scattering
supply/bardblu/bardbl2−/bardbly/bardbl2via the Cayley transform [27]. We focus on the former and thus
consider the optimal control problem

0yTudt
subject to the dynamics ( pH) and
x(0)=x0,x(T)=xT.

(pHOCPT)
Here and in the following, we assume x0,xT∈K, where K⊆Rnis a compact set. Further,
as we are interested in the properties of optimal solutions t o (pHOCPT), throughout the
paper we assume that an optimal solution u∗and a corresponding trajectory x∗exist. This
assumption is quite restrictive and may be violated. The exi stence and uniqueness of
optimal controls for nonlinear differential-algebraic eq uations is studied in, e.g., [13].
It can be shown [18] that the power-balance equation
d
dtH(x)=−η(x)TR(x)η(x)+yTu (1)
3holds along any solution xof (pH). This allows us to rewrite the cost functional CpH,T(u)
as
CpH,T(u)=H(xT)−H(x0)+/integraldisplayT
0/bardblR(x)1/2η(x)/bardbl2dt.
This equation is called the energy-balance equation, and we can interpret each of the
terms physically [20]. The term H(xT)−H(x0)measures the conserved energy, while
the integral term corresponds to the dissipated energy. By r earranging and plugging in the
deﬁniton of CpH,T, we see that
H(xT)−H(x0)=/integraldisplayT
0yTu−/bardblR(x)1/2η(x)/bardbl2dt.
Note that this implies dissipativity in the sense of Willems [34], and as a consequence
shows the aforementioned passivity of pHsystems. We will use both of these equations
in Section 5.
3 Submanifolds of Rnand the orthogonal projection
This section repeats mostly well-known results regarding s ubmanifolds of Rn, with a
focus on manifolds deﬁned as the zero locus of some smooth fun ction. The main result
of the section is Lemma 5, which provides an upper bound for th e distance of a point to
such a manifold.
We begin with recalling the classical deﬁntion of submanifo lds ofRn. Following [6,
15], we distinguish manifolds whose tangent spaces locally satisfy a Lipschitz condition.
Deﬁnition 2 (submanifolds of Rn).
•LetMbe a subset of Rn. We call Man s-dimensional Ckmanifold if for each
p∈ M there exists an open neighborhood U of p and a Ckdiffeomorphism φ:
U→φ(U)⊆Rnsuch that
M∩ U={x∈U|φs+1(x)=···=φn(x)=0}.
The function φis called a local coordinate system of Matp.
•LetM⊆Rnbe an s-dimensional manifold, p ∈M and let φ:U→Rnbe a local
coordinate system of Mat p. We deﬁne the tangent space at prelative to Mas
TpM:=Dφ−1
φ(p)({y∈Rn|ys+1=···=yn=0}).
The space N pM:=TpM⊥is called the normal space at prelative to M.
•We callM⊆Rnan s-dimensional Ck,1manifold ifMis an s-dimensional Ckman-
ifold and for all p ∈M there exists a set V ⊆M that is open relative to Mand a
positive constant L >0such that p ∈V and for all /tildewidep∈V it holds that
dH(TpM,T/tildewidepM)≤L/bardblp−/tildewidep/bardbl.
Here, d Hdenotes the Hausdorff distance deﬁned by
dH(T1,T2):=sup{inf{/bardblt2−t1/bardbl |t2∈T2∩S} |t1∈T1∩S},
where S :={z∈Rn|/bardblz/bardbl=1}is the unit sphere.
4Next, we recall the deﬁnition of the orthogonal projection o n a manifold from [15].
For this, consider a manifold M⊆Rnand deﬁne the set of points with the unique nearest
points property as
unpp(M):={x∈Rn|there exists a unique ξ∈M with dist(x,M)=/bardblx−ξ/bardbl}.
Clearly, for each x∈unpp(M)there exists a unique p(x)∈M with the property
/bardblx−p(x)/bardbl=dist(x,M)= inf
p∈M/bardblx−p/bardbl.
Deﬁnition 3 (orthogonal projection on manifold, [15]) .LetM⊆Rnbe a manifold. The
function p :unpp(M)→M,x/mapsto→p(x)is called the orthogonal projection on M.
Often, we write pxinstead of p(x). The maximal open set on which the orthogonal
projection is deﬁned plays a special role in [15] and also in o ur setting. We will refer to
this set as E(M):=unpp(M)◦.
The next proposition collects selected results on submanif olds ofRndeﬁned in a par-
ticular manner and will be useful in Section 5, where it will a llow us to study the optimal
control problem ( pHOCPT).
Proposition 4. Suppose f :Rn→Rnis of class C2, assume that
M:={x∈Rn|f(x)=0}
is nonempty and assume that there exists an open neighborhoo d G⊆RnofMsuch that
for all x∈G it holds that dim(ker(D fx))= s, where the constant s is independent of x and
satisﬁes 0<s<n. Then
(i) the set Mis an s-dimensional C2submanifold of Rn,
(ii) the tangent space at p ∈M is given by T pM=ker(D fp),
(iii) the manifold Mis a C2,1manifold, and
(iv) it holds that M⊆E(M), and if x∈E(M)\M then x−px⊥TpxM.
Proof.
(i) Let p∈M . It can be shown [33] that there exist open neighborhoods U1⊆Rnofp
andU2⊆Rnoff(p)andC2diffeomorphisms
φ:U1→φ(U1)and ψ:U2→ψ(U2)
such that
f(U1)⊆U2
and
ψ◦f◦φ−1(y1,..., yn)=( y1,..., yn−s,0,..., 0)
for all y∈φ(U1). Thus, for each v∈U1we have
v∈M⇐⇒ f(v)=0
⇐⇒(ψ◦f)(v)=0
⇐⇒(ψ◦f◦φ−1◦φ)(v)=0
⇐⇒ φ1(v)=···=φn−s(v)=0.
5(ii) Suppose that p∈M and that φ:U→Rnis a local coordinate system of Matp.
Since
(f◦φ−1)/parenleftbig
{y∈Rn|ys+1=···=yn=0}∩φ(U)/parenrightbig
={0},
we have
D fp(TpM)=D fp/parenleftBig
Dφ−1
φ(p)/parenleftbig
{y∈Rn|ys+1=···=yn=0}/parenrightbig/parenrightBig
=0.
The claim then follows from the fact that ker (D fp)has dimension s.
(iii) In [6, Equations (3.3) and (3.6)], it is shown that a Ckmanifold with k≥2 is also a
Ck,1manifold, from which the claim follows.
(iv) This claim was proven in [15]. /squaresolid
We ﬁnish this section with Lemma 5 and a corresponding remark . The lemma es-
tablishes an upper bound on the distance to the manifold Mdeﬁned in Proposition 4 in
terms of the function f. This result will be the key in our application to port-Hamil tonian
systems, as it will allow us to deduce a dissipativity proper ty for ( pHOCPT).
Lemma 5. Suppose f :Rn→Rnis of class C2, assume that
M:={x∈Rn|f(x)=0}
is nonempty and assume that there exists an open neighborhoo d G⊆RnofMsuch that
for all x∈G it holds that dim(ker(D fx)) = s, where the constant s is independent of x
and satisﬁes 0<s<n. Further, assume that for each x ∈G the smallest nonzero singular
value of D f xis bounded from below by /tildewidec>0. ThenMis a C2manifold and there exists
an open set V ⊆Rnand a constant c >0withM⊆ V⊆E(M)and
cdist(x,M)≤/bardblf(x)/bardbl (2)
for all x∈V .
Proof. We will ﬁrst show that (2) is true locally. Fix a point p∈M and notice that due
tof∈C2, for all x∈Rnwe have
f(x)=f(p)+D fp(x−p)+gp(x−p), (3)
where the remainder gpsatisﬁes
lim
x→p/bardblgp(x−p)/bardbl
/bardblx−p/bardbl=0. (4)
To establish (2) locally, our ﬁrst goal is to show that there e xists an open set Up⊆E(M)
such that for all x∈Vp:=Up∩NpMwe have
/bardblgp(x−p)/bardbl
/bardblD fp(x−p)/bardbl<1
2. (5)
For the sake of simplicity, let us set Ap:=D fT
pD fp. Then, by the deﬁnition of M
and Proposition 4, we have ker (Ap) =ker(D fp) =TpM.Now, let us decompose Rn=
6ker(Ap)⊕ran(Ap) =TpM⊕ NpMand accordingly also Ap=0⊕A(2)
p. Since A(2)
pis
symmetric positive deﬁnite, for any x∈NpMwe obtain
/bardblD fp(x−p)/bardbl2=(x−p)TAp(x−p)=( x−p)TA(2)
p(x−p)≥λmin(A(2)
p)/bardblx−p/bardbl2.(6)
Now, using (4) and (6), we obtain
0=lim
x→p/bardblgp(x−p)/bardbl
/bardblx−p/bardbl≥lim
x→pcp/bardblgp(x−p)/bardbl
/bardblD fp(x−p)/bardbl≥0,
where we set cp:=λmin(A(2)
p)1/2>0. In particular, we have
lim
x→p/bardblgp(x−p)/bardbl
/bardblD fp(x−p)/bardbl=0.
Thus, choosing x∈NpMsufﬁciently close to pwe obtain the estimate (5), and we can
deduce that an open set Upwith the sought-after properties has to exist. Now, since (3 )
andp∈M implies
/bardblD fp(x−p)/bardbl≤/bardbl f(x)/bardbl+/bardblgp(x−p)/bardblfor all x∈Rn,
using (5) we obtain
1
2/bardblD fp(x−p)/bardbl≤/bardbl f(x)/bardblfor all x∈Vp=Up∩NpM. (7)
To ﬁnish the local argument, notice that by (6) we have
cpdist(x,M)=cp/bardblx−p/bardbl≤/bardbl D fp(x−p)/bardblfor all x∈Vp,
which together with (7) shows that (2) holds for all x∈Vp.
To construct the set V, ﬁrst notice that the differentiability of fimplies that an ex-
pression of the form (3) is possible on the set E(M). In other words, there exists a
function g·(·)such that
f(x)=f(px)+D fpx(x−px)+gpx(x−px)
for all x∈E(M). Since the orthogonal projection x/mapsto→pxis differentiable [15] and f∈C2,
the map x/mapsto→gpx(x−px)is continuous on E(M). Deﬁne the function
h:E(M)→R,x/mapsto→/bardblgpx(x−px)/bardbl
/bardblD fpx(x−px)/bardbl.
Then his continuous and hence the preimage of the open set (−∞,1
2)⊆Runder his open.
Note that Mis a subset of this preimage. Deﬁne
M⊆ V:=h−1/parenleftbig
(−∞,1
2)/parenrightbig
⊆E(M).
Then for each p∈M we have
Vp⊆V∩NpM.
The previous arguments can then be used to show that for c:=/tildewidec
2andx∈Vwe have
2cdist(x,M)≤cpxdist(x,M)≤/bardblD fpx(x−px)/bardbl≤2/bardblf(x)/bardbl,
ﬁnishing the proof. /squaresolid
7Remark 6. The estimate (2)is related to the Łojasiewicz inequality [12,16], which sta tes
that for a real analytic function g :U→Rdeﬁned on an open set U ⊆Rnand a compact
set K⊆U, the distance of x ∈K to the zero locus Z:={z∈U|g(z)=0}of g may be
estimated by
dist(x,Z)α≤C|g(x)|,
where αand C are positive constants.
4 Manifold dissipativity and manifold turnpikes
In this section, we recall the deﬁnition of dissipativity wi th respect to a manifold and the
deﬁnition of manifold turnpikes as introduced in [7]. Furth er, a theorem relating the two
properties is stated. Here and in the following, the set Kis deﬁned as
K:={α:[0,∞)→[0,∞)|α(0)=0,αis continuous and strictly increasing }.
We consider the general optimal control problem
min
u∈UCT(u):=/integraldisplayT
0ℓ(x,u)dt
subject to
h(x)˙x=g(x,u),
x(0)=x0,x(T)=xT.

(OCP T)
As before, we assume x0,xT∈K, where K⊆Rnis a compact set. Here, the function
gdeﬁnes the dynamics of the system and the function hcorresponds to possible alge-
braic constraints. We refrain from further speciﬁcation of these functions as (OCP T) is
only used for general deﬁnitions. Throughout this section, we assume that an optimal
control u∗of (OCP T) and an associated trajectory x∗exist.
We begin with the deﬁnition of manifold dissipativity. The d eﬁnition is related to
Willems’ notion of dissipativity [34] and is also found in [7 ].
Deﬁnition 7 (manifold dissipativity) .Consider the optimal control problem (OCP T)to-
gether with the manifold M⊆Rn. We say that (OCP T)isdissipative with respect to the
manifold Mif there exists a function S:Rn→[0,∞)that is bounded on compact sets and
a function α∈K such that all optimal controls u∗and associated trajectories x∗satisfy
the dissipation inequality
S(xT)−S(x0)≤/integraldisplayT
0ℓ(x∗,u∗)−α(dist(x∗,M))dt (8)
for all T>0.
The function Sfrom Deﬁnition 7 is also called storage function. Note that w e require
the dissipation inequality (8) only to hold along optimal so lutions of (OCP T). This is not
a severe restriction when turnpike phenomona are studied, a s we are only interested in
properties of optimal solutions.
Next, we deﬁne a manifold turnpike property, again followin g [7]. The property is
essentially a notion of measure turnpikes, see, e.g., [3, 8, 28, 36].
8Deﬁnition 8 (manifold turnpike) .Consider the optimal control problem (OCP T)together
with the manifold M⊆Rn. We say that (OCP T)has the manifold turnpike property with
respect to the manifold Mif for all compact sets K ⊆Rnand all ε>0there exists a
constant C K,ε>0such that for all T >0all optimal trajectories x∗of(OCP T)satisfy
λ/parenleftbig
{t∈[0,T]|dist(x∗(t),M)>ε}/parenrightbig
≤CK,ε
for all x 0,xT∈K. Here, λdenotes the Lebesgue-measure.
The next theorem can be found similarly in [7,8,11]. The theo rem shows that manifold
dissipativity implies a manifold turnpike property.
Theorem 9 (manifold dissipativity implies manifold turnpike) .Consider the optimal con-
trol problem (OCP T)together with a submanifold M⊆Rnand assume that
(i) there exists a constant C ℓ(K)>0such that for all optimal controls u∗of(OCP T)
and the associated trajectories x∗we have
/integraldisplayT
0ℓ(x∗,u∗)dt<Cℓ(K)
for all T>0, and
(ii) the optimal control problem is dissipative with respec t to the manifold M.
Then the optimal control problem (OCP T)has the manifold turnpike property.
Remark 10. In [7], Theorem 9 is stated with a stronger assumption in the p lace of (i),
which can be interpreted as a controllability property. For the sake of simplicity, we do
not consider this case.
5 Application to port-Hamiltonian systems
Finally, we are ready to apply the previous results to port-H amiltonian systems and the
optimal control problem ( pHOCPT). First, recall that we can rewrite the cost functional
CpH,T(u)as
CpH,T(u)=/integraldisplayT
0yTudt=H(xT)−H(x0)+/integraldisplayT
0/bardblR(x)1/2η(x)/bardbl2dt, (9)
and that rearranging gives
H(xT)−H(x0)=/integraldisplayT
0yTu−/bardblR(x)1/2η(x)/bardbl2dt. (10)
Equation (9) hints that any optimal trajectory will have to s pend most of the time close to
the set
M:=/braceleftbig
x∈Rn/vextendsingle/vextendsingleR(x)1/2η(x)=0/bracerightbig
,
and thatHcan be used as a storage function to derive dissipativity not ions with respect
toM. Our aim will be to formalize these ideas. The ﬁrst step will b e to ensure that M
has the necessary manifold structure. For that, we make the f ollowing assumptions.
9Assumption 11.
(A1) The map f :Rn→Rn,x/mapsto→R(x)1/2η(x)is of class C2.
(A2) The set Mis nonempty and there exists an open neighborhood G ⊆RnofMsuch
that for all x ∈G it holds that dim(ker(D fx))= s, where the constant s is indepen-
dent of x and satisﬁes 0<s<n.
(A3) For each x ∈G, the smallest nonzero singular value of D f xis bounded from below
by a positive constant /tildewidec>0.
(A4) Let V be the open set from Lemma 5. Any optimal trajectory x∗of(pHOCPT)
remains in V for all times.
With assumptions (A1) and (A2), Proposition 4 ensures that Mis an s-dimensional
C2,1submanifold of Rnand thatM⊆E(M).
The next step is to show that the problem is dissipative. As we will see shortly, this is
ensured by assumptions (A3) and (A4), which allow us to use Le mma 5 to conclude that
the optimal control problem ( pHOCPT) is dissipative with respect to the manifold M.
Notice that (A4) implies x0,xT∈V.
Theorem 12 ((pHOCPT) is dissipative) .Under Assumption 11, the optimal control prob-
lem(pHOCPT)is dissipative with respect to the manifold Mwith storage function H.
Proof. The proof is essentially an application of Lemma 5. Since all assumptions of
Lemma 5 are satisﬁed under Assumption 11, there exists an ope n set V⊆Rnand constant
c>0 such that M⊆ V⊆E(M)and
cdist(x,M)≤/bardblf(x)/bardbl=/bardblR(x)1/2η(x)/bardbl (11)
holds for all x∈V. In particular, assumption (A4) ensures that the estimate h olds along
any optimal trajectory x∗of (pHOCPT). With this and (10), we see that for any optimal
control u∗and the associated trajectory x∗and output y∗, we have
H(xT)−H(x0)=/integraldisplayT
0y∗Tu∗−/bardblR(x∗)1/2η(x∗)/bardbl2dt
≤/integraldisplayT
0y∗Tu∗−c2dist(x∗,M)2dt
=/integraldisplayT
0y∗Tu∗−α(dist(x∗,M))dt,
where α:s/mapsto→c2s2∈K. Finally, note that the Hamiltonian H, acting as a storage function
here, is bounded on compact sets since it is differentiable. /squaresolid
Remark 13. Let us emphasize that the estimate (2)from Lemma 5 was the key to con-
clude the dissipativity property of (pHOCPT). As we have mentioned in Remark 6, the
estimate is related to Łojasiewicz’ inequality [12, 16]. In fact, if the map g :x/mapsto→/bardbl f(x)/bardbl2
is real analytic, then we may use the Łojasiewicz inequality to derive dissipativity with-
out Lemma 5, as long as any optimal trajectory stays in some co mpact set D ⊆Rn.
Now, an application of Theorem 9 yields the following result , showing that the optimal
control problem ( pHOCPT) has the manifold turnpike property with respect to M.
10Theorem 14 ((pHOCPT) has a manifold turnpike) .In addition to Assumption 11, assume
(A5) there exists a control u 1∈U adthat steers the associated trajectory x 1from x 0onto
the manifold Min time T 1≥0, and
(A6) there exists a control u 2∈ U adthat steers the associated trajectory x 2from the
manifold Mto x Tin time T 2≥0.
Then the optimal control problem (pHOCPT)has a manifold turnpike at the manifold M.
Proof. Since the port-Hamiltonian system ( pH) is autonomous and there is no control cost
on the manifold M, the conditions (A5) and (A6) ensure that the total cost of th e optimal
control u∗is bounded by
CpH,T(u∗)=/integraldisplayT
0y∗Tu∗dt
=H(xT)−H(x0)+/integraldisplayT
0/bardblR(x∗)1/2η(x∗)/bardbl2dt
≤CH(K)+/integraldisplayT1
0/bardblR(x1)1/2η(x1)/bardbl2dt+/integraldisplayT2
0/bardblR(x2)1/2η(x2)/bardbl2dt
≤CH(K)+C1(K)+C2(K)<∞.
Notice that the constants CH(K),C1(K)andC2(K)are independent of the ﬁnal time T.
Thus, using the results of Theorem 12, we may apply Theorem 9 t o conclude that the
optimal control problem ( pHOCPT) has the manifold turnpike property at M./squaresolid
In Theorem 14, in order to show that a turnpike property holds true, we needed to
make the controllability assumptions (A5) and (A6). This is a common pattern in turnpike
results, similar controllability assumptions are made in [ 3, 7] and [26].
Remark 15. In [26], the authors considered linear pHsystems of the form
˙x=(J−R)Qx+Bu,
y=BTQx,
where J=−JT, R=RT/{ollowsequal0and Q=QT≻0. They have shown that in this case the
optimal control problem (pHOCPT)admits a subspace turnpike property with respect
toker(R1/2Q). We can interpret Theorem 14 as a generalization of this resu lt to the
nonlinear case. In the linear case, assumption (A1) is immed iately satisﬁed. Further,
the setMis the kernel of R1/2Q, and if the dimension of ker(R1/2Q)is0<s<n, then
assumptions (A2) and (A3) are also satisﬁed. Since the dista nce estimate (11) can be
shown to hold true globally [26, Lemma 13], the set V from Lemm a 5 is V=Rnand thus
assumption (A4) is also satisﬁed.
We ﬁnish this section with a simple example illustrating The orem 14.
Example 16. Consider the functions E ,J,R,ηand B deﬁned by
E(x)=/bracketleftbigg1 0

form the port-Hamiltonian system
E(x)˙x=/parenleftbig

η(x)+B(x)u,
y=B(x)Tη(x).(pH-1 )
For the system (pH-1 ), the function f reads as
f:R2→R2,x/mapsto→R(x)1/2η(x)=/bracketleftbigg

0 0/bracketrightbigg
x=/bracketleftbigg

,
where we take x =/bracketleftbig
x1x2/bracketrightbigT. Thus, the derivative D f reads as
D f(x)=/bracketleftbigg
12x2
1+4x2
2+1 8x2x1
0 0/bracketrightbigg
/\e}atio\slash=0
and the subspace ker(D f(x))is one-dimensional for all x ∈R2. A simple calculation
shows that the nonzero singular value of D f (x)is given by
σ(x)=144x4
1+160x2
1x2
2+24x2
1+16x4
2+8x2
2+1≥1.
The zero locus Mof f is given by
M=/braceleftbigg/bracketleftbigg

.
Hence, assumptions (A1), (A2) and (A3) are satisﬁed for (pH-1 ). AsMis a linear sub-
space, the orthogonal projection on Mis well deﬁned globally and we have E(M)=R2.
Further, for the set V from Lemma 5 it holds that V =R2since
dist(x,M)=|x1|≤|x1(4x2
1+4x2
2+1)|=/bardblf(x)/bardbl
for all x∈R2. Thus, also assumption (A4) is satisﬁed for (pH-1 ).
Now, for ξ=/bracketleftbig

It is easy to see that also the system

/tildewidey=/tildewideB(ξ)T/tildewideη(ξ)(pH-2 )

126 Numerical example
As an example, we consider the optimal control problem ( pHOCPT) together with the
pHsystems ( pH-1 ) and ( pH-2 ) from Example 16. For the implementation, we use the
open-source software package CasADi [1].
In order to use CasADi , the optimal control problem ( pHOCPT) is formulated as a
minimization problem of the form
min
wJ(w)
subject to wlb≤w≤wuband G(w)=0.(12)
We follow a similar procedure as [1, Section 5.4]. In our impl ementation, wcontains the
values x(ti)for the discretization points ti∈[0,T], and the values u(ti)for the discretiza-
tion points ti∈[0,T],i/\e}atio\slash=0. The initial condition and possible control constraints a re
incorporated in wlbandwub. The function Gis used to enforce the ﬁnal condition and
a continuity condition on xby using an integrator scheme to determine the value x(ti+1)
given the values x(ti)andu(ti). This integrator scheme is also used to calculate the cost J
via thequad option in CasADi ’sintegrator function. For the solution of the nonlinear
optimization problem (12), Ipopt [35] is used.
In Figure 1, the solution of the optimal control problem ( pHOCPT) with the sys-
tem (pH-1 ) under the control constraint −50≤u(t)≤50 is shown. The turnpike be-
haviour is clearly visible; the ﬁrst component x1of the optimal trajectory x∗approaches
the manifold M={x∈R2|x1=0}very quickly and remains there for the majority of
the time horizon. The same observation can be made for larger time horizons, which is
not shown in Figure 1.
In Figure 2, the solution of the optimal control problem ( pHOCPT) with the sys-
tem (pH-2 ) under the control constraint −200≤u(t)≤200 is shown. Again, the turnpike
phenomenon can be observed.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we have considered the optimal control of port -Hamiltonian systems under
minimal energy supply with ﬁxed initial and ﬁnal values. We h ave seen that a map f,
corresponding to the energy dissipating portion of the righ t hand side, and its zero locus
M={x|f(x) =0}, which corresponds to the dissipative part of the state spac e, play
an important role. It was shown that under smoothness assump tions on f, the setM
forms a C2submanifold of Rn. In particular, using results from [15], we observed that
the orthogonal projection onto Mis well-deﬁned in an open set E(M). Further, we have
shown that under these assumptions the distance of a point xtoMcan essentially be
bounded by /bardblf(x)/bardblfrom above. This fact allowed us to deduce that the considere d opti-
mal control problem is dissipative with respect to the manif oldM. Our main result was a
consequence of this dissipativity property. Under additio nal controllability assumptions,
we have seen that the problem has a manifold turnpike propert y with respect to M. This
theoretical observation was conﬁrmed in a simple numerical example.
An open question from a theoretical perspective is the exist ence of optimal controls
of (pHOCPT). Here, similar to [9, 22, 26], the particular structure of pHsystems should
