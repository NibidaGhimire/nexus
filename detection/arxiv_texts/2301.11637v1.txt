In time-reversal invariant systems, all charge Hall effect s predicted so far are extrinsic effects due to the
dependence on the relaxation time. We explore intrinsic Hal l signatures by studying quantum noise spectrum
of the Hall current in time-reversal invariant systems, and discover intrinsic thermal Hall noises in both linear
and nonlinear regimes. As the band geometric characteristi cs, quantum geometric tensor and Berry curvature
play critical roles in various Hall effects, so are their qua ntum ﬂuctuations. It is found that the thermal Hall
noise in linear order of the electric ﬁeld is purely intrinsi c, and the second-order thermal Hall noise has both
intrinsic and extrinsic contributions. In particular, the intrinsic part of the second-order thermal Hall noise is
a manifestation of the quantum ﬂuctuation of quantum geomet ric tensor, which widely exists as long as Berry
curvature is nonzero. These intrinsic thermal Hall noises p rovide direct measurable means to band geometric
information, including Berry curvature related quantitie s and quantum ﬂuctuation of quantum geometric tensor.
Introduction. Quantum geometric tensor (QGT)1–5has funda-
mental importance in modern condensed matter physics, sinc e
it contains the band geometry and topology information of th e
underlying Hamiltonian. The imaginary part of QGT, Berry
curvature,6plays critical role in various Hall effects, such as
quantum Hall effect,7quantum spin Hall effect,8,9and quan-
tum anomalous Hall effect,10–12etc. The dipole moment of
Berry curvature, i.e., Berry curvature dipole (BCD),13,14can
induce an extrinsic second-order nonlinear Hall effect in time-
reversal (TR) invariant systems, which has been intensivel y
discussed15–22and experimentally veriﬁed.23–29It is found that
extrinsic mechanisms such as skew-scattering can dominate
the second-order Hall effect in thick T d-MoTe2 samples and
result in giant c-axis nonlinear Hall conductivity.30Intrinsic
response properties, which is independent of the relaxatio n
time and not affected by the scattering process, can directl y
probe band information related to Berry curvature as well as
QGT, and hence are of special interest. Up to now, intrin-
sic linear spin Hall effect has been proposed in both TR-
invariant systems31and TR-broken systems.32In nonlinear
regime, intrinsic second-order anomalous Hall effects hav e
been reported in TR-broken systems recently.33–35As far as
we know, in TR-invariant systems, intrinsic charge Hall tra ns-
port phenomenon induced by Berry curvature or QGT has not
been predicted.
The Hall effect refers to the transverse current or voltage i n
response to the driving electric ﬁeld. In various Hall trans port,
quantum ﬂuctuation of currents widely exists. Such quan-
tum ﬂuctuation or quantum noise originates from the quan-
tum nature of charge carriers, where quantum interference a nd
Pauli exclusion principle play important roles.36Therefore,
in addition to the average current, quantum noise associate d
with the Hall current, i.e., the Hall/transverse noise spec trum,
and higher-order correlations,37,38are needed to fully char-
acterize Hall transport properties, as well as the underlyi ng
Berry curvature and QGT. In topological insulators, quantu m
noise has been proposed to assess the quality of edge state
transport,39–42which are experimentally measured in HgTe
quantum wells43,44and InAS/Ga(In)Sb structures.45Quantumnoise has also been utilized to identify strongly correlate d
nonlocal Majorana states.46–51On the other hand, there are at-
tempts to measure QGT and related topological matters,52–54
via superconducting qubit55or microwave spectroscopy.56
Several questions arise: is there any intrinsic charge Hall
signature in time-reversal invariant systems? how to descr ibe
quantum noise of the Hall current and ﬂuctuation of the quan-
tum geometric tensor? what is the relation between them?
In this work, we answer these questions by studying quan-
tum current correlation in coherent transport and identify ing
its relation to QGT. In TR-invariant systems, when expand-
ing the thermal noise spectrum in terms of the electric ﬁeld
at low voltage, we ﬁnd intrinsic thermal Hall noises in both
linear and nonlinear response regimes, which are explicitl y
expressed in terms of Berry curvature related quantities. T he
linear thermal Hall noise is purely intrinsic, and an intere st-
ing dual relation on BCD is established between the extrinsi c
second-order Hall current and this intrinsic linear Hall no ise
in two-dimensional (2D) systems. The intrinsic part of the
second-order thermal Hall noise is contributed by quantum
ﬂuctuation of Berry curvature, which is the manifestation o f
quantum ﬂuctuation of QGT. The Hall noise spectrum can be
easily measured on platforms similar to previous detection of
the BCD-induced second-order Hall effect,23–28and we pro-
pose feasible strategies to extract Berry curvature ﬂuctua tion
from the noise signals. Berry curvature ﬂuctuation in 3D sys -
tems is also discussed, which is directly accessible via a th ree-
step measurement. These ﬁndings reveal that, QGT related
information, i.e., Berry curvature dipole and Berry curvat ure
ﬂuctuation, are qualitatively measurable through the intr insic
thermal Hall noises of TR-invariant systems.

requires low temperature, where SS

lthe system size. In contrast, thermal noise is dominant at lo w
voltageeEl≪kBT36and easily measurable via temperature-
dependent experiments in large temperature ranges, from se v-
eral Kelvin58to room temperature.59In the following, we fo-
cus on the thermal noise in the regime eEl≪kBT. For sim-
plicity,ST
abis denoted as Saband all noises discussed below
are thermal noises.
For a particular band n,60Eq.(2) can be transformed into a
compact vector form,
Sab=/integraldisplay
kfn(1−fn)(v−Ω×E)a(v−Ω×E)b.(4)
Sabis a second-rank symmetric tensor. Its diagonal ele-
ments,Saa(a=x,y, andz), are auto-correlation of cur-
rents and contain the Hall noises. The off-diagonal element s,
Sab=Sba(a/ne}ationslash=b), correspond to the cross-correlation func-
tion. Expanding Sabin terms of the electric ﬁeld in the regime
eEl≪kBT, we have
Sab=S(1)
ab+S(2)
ab+O(E3)..., (5)
whereS(1)

electric ﬁeld, respectively.
The linear noise is obtained from Eq.( 4)

Denoting the BCD pseudotensor in matrix form as Dab=

S(1)
ab=−kBT(Da×E)b−kBT(Db×E)a. (7)
Symmetry analysis on S(1)
abis presented in Sec. I(3) of
the supplementary material. In 2D, point groups support-
ing nonzero S(1)
abare{C1,C1v,C2}, while in 3D they are
{Cn,Cnv,D2,D2d,D3,D4,D6,S4}withn= 1,2,3,4,6.
In 2D TR-invariant systems, only Ωzcan be nonzero and
the highest symmetry allowed for nonvanishing BCD is single
mirror symmetry.13Consequently, BCD tensor Dabis reduced
to an in-plane pseudovector. Labeling the BCD vector as D=/integraltext
kf0∇kΩz= (Dx,Dy), the diagonal element of S(1)
ab, i.e.
the linear Hall noise, is written as
S(1)
aa= 2kBTDaˆz·(ˆa×E). (8)
For the same system, linear Hall effect vanishes due to the
time-reversal constraint. Hence the leading order Hall eff ect
is the BCD-induced second-order Hall current13
J(2)=τˆz×E(D·E). (9)
In contrast to the extrinsic second-order Hall current which
scales with the relaxation time τ, the linear Hall noise S(1)
aais
anintrinsic property. The vector notation of linear Hall noise
is highly relevant to that of the second-order Hall current.
The nonlinear Hall current is optimal when electric ﬁeld E
is aligned with BCD vector D, whereas vanishes for E⊥D.
On the contrary, S(1)
aais nonzero when the electric ﬁeld is per-
pendicular to D.

Notice that Ω(2)

theBerry curvature ﬂuctuation , a new signature of band ge-
ometry, which is the second-order moment of Berry curva-
ture.Ω(2)
abis observable in any systems with nonzero Berry
curvature, and hence intrinsic contributions from Ω(2)
abto the
second-order noise always exist in the presence or absence o f
Tsymmetry. We show in the following that Ω(2)

festation of quantum ﬂuctuation of QGT.

Clearly, the real part of QGT is the quantum metric gab,

Here the minus sign reﬂects the anti-Hermitian nature of
ˆΩab. Then we integrate (∆Ω)xxand(∆Ω)yyover the
Brillion zone to obtain the observable ﬂuctuation: ∆Ω =/integraltext

is manifested by quantum ﬂuctuation of Berry curvature.

n= 2,3,4,6. The symmetry analysis is very similar to that
in Ref. [ 13]. As an example, we show the energy dependence
ofΩ(2)

to extract Ω(2)
zfrom Hall noise signals later.
The third-order correlation Kabcis explicitly expressed in
Sec.I(3) of the supplementary material.64Following this route,
full-counting statistics37,38within the Boltzmann approach is
established. We also derive similar expressions of the line ar
and second-order Hall noises within the scattering matrix t he-
ory (SMT) to demonstrate the agreement between these two
methods, as shown in Sec. IIof the supplementary material64
and references [ 65–67] therein. SMT is suitable for describing
coherent nonlinear transport in multiterminal systems.22,68
We focus on the Hall noise spectrum, which can be simul-
taneously probed with the Hall currents in one measurement.

Dxexists. Its band structure is shown in Fig. 1(a). Such a

xx. BCD-induced
second-order Hall effect has been observed in large ranges o f
temperature and driving current for a variety of materials,72
and we expect BCD-induced linear Hall noise can be mea-
sured on similar platforms.23,27,28
The phenomena displayed in Eq.( 15) appear to be counter-
intuitive: (1) when nonlinear Hall current J(2)
Hvanishes, lin-
ear Hall noise is nonzero; (2) if J(2)
His ﬁnite, linear noise S(1)
H4
is zero. It can be understood as follows: (1) J(2)
H= 0 only
means the average Hall current /an}b∇acketle{tˆJH/an}b∇acket∇i}htis zero up to the second
order in electric ﬁeld, but quantum correlation of currents is
ﬁnite, i.e. S(1)
H/ne}ationslash= 0; (2) when J(2)
H/ne}ationslash= 0, only linear Hall
noiseS(1)
Hvanishes,73but the second-order Hall noise S(2)
H
exists (as discussed below). Similar behaviors are reporte d in
various nonequilibrium transport74,75: a system with pure spin
current has ﬁnite charge noise when the average charge cur-
rent vanishes76,77; zero-current nonequilibrium delta- Tnoise
are generated by pure temperature bias.78–81

Without loss of generality, we set Ex=Ey= 1in the follow-
ing discussion. There are two contributions in S(2)
H. The ﬁrst
termMabscales as τ2, hence we refer it as the extrinsic Hall
noise , whose existence is also conﬁrmed by SMT (Sec. II(2)
of the supplementary material.64) The second intrinsic term is
contributed by Ω(2)
z. It seems difﬁcult to extract Ω(2)
zfrom the
second-order Hall noise due to the presence of Mab. We pro-
pose two strategies to isolate Ω(2)
z.
(1) Energy dependence. For S(2)
yyin Eq.( 17), we can
split the extrinsic noise Mxyinto two parts: M(1)

Fig.3(a) shows that both M(1)

xyare much smaller

zfor small energies. Hence Ω(2)
zis easily ex-
tracted in the small energy range. However, when M(2)
xydom-
inates the Hall noise for large energies, this strategy fail s.
(2) Temperature scaling. The temperature dependence of
these noise terms are illustrated in Fig. 3(b), where M(2)
xyis
inversely proportional to Twhile both M(1)
xyandkBTΩ(2)
zare
directly proportional to T. When we scale them by multi-
plying a factor kBT, Fig. 3(c) shows kBTM(2)
xyis largely a
constant. At low temperature, e.g., T= 10 K , contributions
fromM(1)
xyandkBTΩ(2)

yyare negligible compared with
M(2)
xy. This motivates the following treatment: (a) measure the
Hall noise S(2)

Discussion. The thermal Hall noise spectrum and Berry cur-
vature ﬂuctuation can be investigated in experimental plat -
forms which were previously adopted to study BCD-induced
second-order Hall effect.23–28The measurement of thermal
noise has been developed as a standard technique for over two
decades.58,59,85,86
In 3D systems, Berry curvature may have more than one
nonzero component and could induce an additional intrinsic
term in the second-order Hall noise, which corresponds to
cross-correlation of Berry curvature. We ﬁnd

With both TandMxsymmetries, Ω(2)
zy=/integraltext
k(−∂ǫf0)ΩzΩy
is an even function of khence nonvanishes. To detect S(2)
xx,
the electric ﬁeld is applied along ˆycosθ+ ˆzsinθdirection.
Rotating the electric ﬁeld in y-zplane by changing θ, we can
determine the three terms of S(2)
xx. The ﬁrst (second) term is
probed at θ= 0 (θ=π/2), and the third term is obtained
by subtracting the other two terms from S(2)
xxmeasured at θ/ne}ationslash=
0,π/2. Note that Ω(2)
zyis directly accessible through this three-
step measurement, and only observable in 3D.5
In summary, by studying the thermal Hall noise spectrum of
time-reversal invariant systems, we have found intrinsic H all
noises in both linear and nonlinear response regimes, which
are all related to Berry curvature as well as quantum geomet-
ric tensor. The intrinsic linear Hall noise is proportional to
Berry curvature dipole. The second-order Hall noise has in-
trinsic contribution from Berry curvature ﬂuctuation. The seintrinsic thermal Hall noises are the manifestation of quan tum
geometric tensor and its quantum ﬂuctuation, which can be
detected on platforms such as T d-WTe2.
