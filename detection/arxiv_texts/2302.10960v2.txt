ABSTRACT
Context. Several observations of the local Universe point towards the existence of very prominent structures. The presence of massive
galaxy clusters and local super clusters on the one hand, but also large local voids and under-densities on the other hand. However, it
is highly non trivial to connect such di fferent observational selected tracers to the underlying dark matter (DM) distribution.
Aims. Therefore, it is needed to construct mock catalogues of such observable tracers using cosmological hydro-dynamical simula-
tions. Such simulations have to follow galaxy formation physics on the one hand and on the other hand have to be constrained to
reproduce the local Universe. Such constraints should be based on observables which directly probe the full underlying gravitational
field, like the observed peculiar velocity field, to provide an independent test on the robustness of those distinctive structures.
Methods. We used a 500 h−1Mpc large constrained simulation of the local Universe to investigate the anomalies in the local den-
sity field as found in observations. Constructing the initial conditions based on peculiar velocities derived from the CosmicFlows-2
catalogue makes the predictions of the simulations completely independent from the distribution of the observed tracer population
and following galaxy formation physics directly in the hydro-dynamical simulations allows to additionally base the comparison di-
rectly on stellar masses of galaxies or X-ray luminosity of clusters. We also used the 2668 h−1Mpc large cosmological box from the
Magneticum simulations to evaluate the frequency of finding such anomalies in random patches within simulations.
Results. We demonstrate that haloes and galaxies in our constrained simulation trace the local dark matter density field very di ffer-
ently. Thereby, this simulation reproduces the observed 50% under-density of galaxy clusters and groups within the sphere of ≈100
Mpc when applying the same mass or X-ray luminosity limit used in the observed cluster sample (CLASSIX), which is consistent
with a ≈1.5σfeature. At the same time, the simulation reproduces the observed over-density of massive galaxy clusters within the
same sphere, which on its own also corresponds to a ≈1.5σfeature. Interestingly, we find that only 44 out of 15635 random realiza-
tions (i.e. 0.28%) are matching both anomalies, making the local Universe to be a ≈3σenvironment. We finally compared a mock
galaxy catalogue with the observed distribution of galaxies in the local Universe, finding also a match to the observed factor of two
over-density at ∼16 Mpc as well as the observed 15% under-density at ∼40 Mpc distance.
Conclusions. Constrained simulations of the local Universe which reproduce the main features of the local density field open a new
window for local field cosmology, where the imprint of the specific density field and the impact on the bias through the observational
specific tracers can be investigated in detail.

1. Introduction
The neighborhood in the immediate vicinity of the Milky Way
(MW) is known as the “Local Group”. It is a binary system com-
posed of two average-sized galaxies (the MW and Andromeda)
that occupies a volume that is roughly ∼7 Mpc in diameter. At a
distance of around 16 Mpc, the Virgo cluster comes into view as
the main defining feature of our neighborhood on these scales.
Beyond Virgo, a number of well-known and well-observed clus-
ters like Centaurus, Fornax, Hydra, Norma, Perseus, and Coma
dominate the local volume, among them a significant number of
very massive clusters.
Therefore, our local Universe, that is centered on us and ex-
tends over 150 h−1Mpc, is not only a formidable site for de-
tailed observations, but also appears as a very particular regionof the Universe. Indeed, starting from a local void (Tully &
Fisher 1987), bordered by the local sheet (Tully et al. 2008),
there are also a large number of super-cluster structures identi-
fied within the local Universe, among them Perseus-Pisces, Cen-
taurus, Coma and Hercules (see recent work by Böhringer &
Chon 2021, and references therein). Several of these most promi-
nent structures in the local Universe form the so-called super-
galactic plane, which was already recognized by de Vaucouleurs
(1953). See also Lahav et al. (2000); Peebles (2022) for a sum-
mary of our current understanding of these structures as well as
Flin (1986); Rubin (1989) for historical reviews. The impact of
these structures is also recognized to form a global, pancake like
structure out to a scale of ∼100 Mpc (Einasto & Miller 1983;
Einasto et al. 1994; Böhringer et al. 2021) as well as large dif-

ferences in the mean stellar density between the Northern and
Southern hemispheres (Karachentsev & Telikova 2018) out to
distances of ∼60 Mpc. It is often argued, that such particular
structures show unusual over- (Makarov & Karachentsev 2011)
or under- (Böhringer et al. 2020) density when using luminous
matter on di fferent scales, with di fferent conclusions when evalu-
ating the underlying dark matter density field from them. As this
could play a significant role in some of the current tensions in
cosmology, for example the larger H0value locally inferred com-
pared to CMB measurements (see Freedman 2021, for a most re-
cent compilation of the values), it is important to understand how
galaxies and galaxy clusters with di fferent masses and properties
trace the underlying dark matter density field. Also, the selection
effect of di fferent observations has to be understood in detail to
answer such questions.
Trying to understand such features in the local Universe mo-
tivated various campaigns producing constrained simulations in
the past. However, for a more detailed study one has to cover
large enough volume, covering several hundreds of Mpc and ini-
tial conditions which are not directly based on the distribution of
the traces to allow an independent comparison. In addition, one
needs to include galaxy formation physics into such simulation
to properly select objects by observables like stellar masses of
galaxies or X-ray luminosity of galaxy clusters. Here we present
simulations, which for the first time matches all the three criteria.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives an ex-
tended summary of previous constrained simulations followed
by section 3, which describes the details of the used simulations,
the included galaxy formation physics and details on the building
of the initial conditions, followed by a qualitative comparison to
observations in section 4. In section 5, we then present the pre-
dicted, spatial distribution of matter, halos and galaxies from the
simulations and compare the peculiar features extensively with
various observations in section 6. In addition to the conclusions
presented in section 7, we also repeated some of the analysis on
previous constrained simulations in the appendix A to demon-
strate the potential inherent in our constrained simulations which
does not depend on assuming a bias between tracer particles and
dark matter but rather predicts this bias quite accurately.
2. Constrained Simulations
There are two approaches to study the problems mentioned
above with numerical simulations. One could run simulations of
very large volumes with very high resolution and find the objects
of interest in these simulations in similar environment as the ob-
served ones. For example, in a statistical approach, the scatter
in the H0value locally inferred can be studied in a box of (6
h−1Gpc)3(Wojtak et al. 2014) or Local Group candidates can be
drawn from a large sample of isolated halo pairs identified in a
set of cosmological simulations (APOSTLE, Fattahi et al. 2016).
An alternative approach is to use so-called constrained cosmo-
logical simulations. The goal of these simulations is to reproduce
as well as possible the positions, velocities, masses and inter-
nal properties of the objects of interest, i.e. to reduce the cos-
mic variance in the region of interest as much as possible. Then
such simulations can go well beyond the statistical approach and
even trace back evolutionary paths of the studied objects. Natu-
rally, constrained simulations are based on observations. There
are two di fferent approaches to obtain initial conditions of cos-
mological simulations based on the observed matter distribution
at present. The first one goes backwards in time and is based
on the Ho ffman-Ribak algorithm (Ho ffman & Ribak 1991). We
will use this algorithm throughout our paper. An alternative ap-

simulations, compared to galaxies from the 2MRS catalogue. To make
the simulations comparable, we restricted to galaxies with stellar masses
above 1010M⊙within a 50 Mpc thick slice around the center of the
simulation volume. We also used a lighter color for galaxies more dis-
tant than 130 Mpc. For the observation, we plotted only galaxies with
log(LK)>10.25 to match the mass cut. In addition, the positions of
Coma, Virgo and Perseus are marked. The virial masses of the accord-
ing halos in the simulations are listed in table 1. From top to bottom:
SLOW, SIBELIUS, CORUSCANT and 2MRS.Article number, page 2 of 16Klaus Dolag et al.: Simulating the LOcal Web (SLOW)
proach to study the local Universe with constrained simulations
has been developed during the last decade, namely a Bayesian
forward modelling (e.g.,Kitaura et al. (2012), [ELUCID] Wang
et al. (2016), [SIBELIUS] Sawala et al. (2022); McAlpine et al.
(2022), for a recent comprehensive discussion of this Bayesian
modeling see Jasche & Lavaux (2019)). The quality of the con-
strained simulations depends on the number and the quality of
the constraints, see for example the discussion of the optimal
sampling of velocity constraints for Wiener Filter reconstruc-
tions by Sorce et al. (2017).
One of the first constrained simulations was based on data
derived from redshift surveys, which estimate the local, total
matter density from the distribution of galaxies using their ob-
served redshift. Here, the main uncertainties are the assumed,
constant relation between galaxy density and total density as
well as the imposed uncertainty in the distances by presence of
peculiar line-of-sight velocity. Initial conditions for a 240 h−1
Mpc box have been constructed, which contains a sphere of 160
h−1Mpc diameter sampled with higher resolution (Mathis et al.
2002). Simulations based on these initial conditions cover dark
matter only simulations combined with semi analytic models
where used to study the local galaxy population (Mathis et al.
2002) and pure magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to study
the propagation of cosmic rays in the local Universe (CORUS-
CANT1, Dolag et al. 2004a) as well as the imprint of the local
super-cluster onto the CMB (Dolag et al. 2005a). Subsequently,
these initial conditions have been evolved with more advanced
physics including radiative cooling, star-formation, stellar evo-
lution and chemical enrichment to study density and temperature
fluctuations in the local and prominent galaxy clusters (SALA-
CIOUS2, Kawahara et al. 2007). Including, additionally, AGN
feedback from supermassive black holes, subsequent simula-
tions based on these initial conditions have been used to con-
trast the observed Sunyaev-Zel’dovich e ffect (SZ) of the Coma
and Virgo clusters as measured by the Planck satellite (Planck
Collaboration et al. 2013b, 2016a).
The other method to constrain initial conditions is based on
peculiar velocities derived from direct distance measures. This
has the advantage that tracing the velocity field is independent
of the tracer population and that the velocity traces the poten-
tial caused by the large scale density field of all matter. How-
ever, the data sets of galaxies with measured distance indicators
are much smaller and the intrinsically large uncertainties asso-
ciated with these distance indicators have to be dealt with in a
very careful way. Early attempts therefore have tried a hybrid
approach, using velocity data combined with constraints coming
from local galaxy clusters which allowed to span large enough
volumes to cover the most important galaxy clusters like Virgo,
Perseus and Coma. This led to the CLUES3(Yepes et al. 2009)
dark matter only simulation of a 160 h−1Mpc box centered on
the MW position to study the local galaxy population (Klypin
et al. 2003) and a non-radiative, hydrodynamical simulation of
the Virgo cluster within that box to study the properties of the
intergalactic medium (Kravtsov et al. 2002). Based on the same
constraints, high resolution simulations of a 64 h−1Mpc box
(Gottlöber et al. 2010) have been performed and used for ex-
ample to study the reionisation of the Local Group (Dixon et al.
2018) while zoomed full hydrodynamical simulations within a
few Mpc large, central region of the same box have been used
for many studies of the Local Group, including simulations fol-

3www.clues-project.orglowing in detail the formation of isolated dwarfs in the neigh-
borhood of the Local Group (see for example Benítez-Llambay
et al. 2015).
The growing data of direct distances from the CosmicFlow
project (e.g. Courtois et al. 2012; Tully et al. 2013, 2016, 2022)
has driven new approaches within the CLUES project since then.
In a series of papers, techniques have been developed to deal
with the increasing number of constraints and to handle the bi-
ases inherent to velocity data (Doumler et al. 2013c,a,b; Sorce
et al. 2014, 2016b; Sorce 2015). Based on this approach, ini-
tial conditions for a 64 h−1Mpc box have been constructed.
They have been used within the CosmicDawn project to run
a fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of cosmic
reionisation and galaxy formation until redshift z=6 (Ocvirk
et al. 2020) as well as to run a dark matter only simulation
with 40963particles down to redshift z=0 within the Mul-
tiDark project. In this simulation, Milky Way and Andromeda
galaxies can be identified so that their reionisation history can
be inferred from the radiation-hydrodynamics simulation (Sorce
et al. 2022). Moreover, initial conditions based on the same ap-
proach have been used to simulate a 100 h−1Mpc box, where
a high resolution region of about 10 h−1Mpc is placed in the
central region around the local group, including detailed galaxy
formation physics (HESTIA, Libeskind et al. 2020). First dark
matter only simulations based on a larger 500 h−1Mpc box al-
ready allowed to reproduce the Virgo cluster and its formation
history (LU2016, Sorce et al. 2016a). Consecutive improvement
of dark matter simulation of this volume allowed to reproduce
more and more prominent galaxy clusters like Perseus and Coma
(CLONES, Constrained LOcal and Nesting Environment Simu-
lations, Sorce 2018), to study the formation history of clusters
(Olchanski & Sorce 2018; Sorce et al. 2020), and to study the
large-scale cosmic web in which clusters like Coma are embed-
ded by comparing observations (Malavasi et al. 2020) and sim-
ulations (Malavasi et al. 2023). Subsequent placing high resolu-
tion regions around such prominent clusters allows direct com-
parison of galaxy properties within the Virgo cluster from hydro-
dynamical simulations with full galaxy formation physics with
their observed counterparts (Sorce et al. 2021). For the first time,
the CLONE (Constrained LOcal and Nesting Environment) sim-
ulation results undoubtedly show that the constrained formation
history of the Virgo cluster significantly di ffers from averaged
clusters of the same mass (Sorce et al. 2021). Moreover, the
simulations indicate phase-space positions of recently in-falling
galaxy groups. It also matches the specific amplitude and shapes
of the appearing velocity waves on the lines-of-sight towards
various, well known galaxy clusters (Sorce et al. 2023).
The SLOW (Simulating the Local Web) simulation4is a 500
h−1Mpc box, using the realization number 8 of CLONES, as
described in Sect. 3.3 and assumes a Planck like cosmology
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2014), with a Hubble constant H0=
67.77km/s/Mpc, a total matter density of ΩMatter =0.307115, a
cosmological constant of ΩΛ=0.692885 and a baryon fraction
corresponding to Ωbaryon =0.0480217. It follows the evolution
of dark and baryonic matter within a (500 h−1Mpc)3simulation
volume centred on the position of the MW and that stands for
our cosmic neighborhood. The initial conditions for such simu-
lations are obtained with sophisticated algorithms (see section
3.3) that take into account the position and motion estimates
of thousands of galaxies within our local volume. These local
measurements allow us to constrain the initial conditions that,
in turn, lead to the observed local large scale structure, when

radial velocity of the clusters in the SLOW simulation to be able to compare their radial distances. See also Sorce (2018) for the variance of

Ragagnin et al. (2021) and using the same cosmology as that used in the SIBELIUS simulation. A more detailed comparison of cluster properties
from the SLOW simulation with observations will be presented in Hernández-Martínez et al. (in prep).
motions since early times until today are followed according to
the gravity laws. In addition, the baryonic matter is treated via
hydro-dynamics together with various, state-of-the-art sub-grid
models (see section 3.2). There are variants which follow the
evolution of the magnetic field and cosmic rays, others are fol-
lowing the formation of the stellar population as well as black
holes (BHs) and associated active galactic nuclei (AGN) physics.
Here we are following the prescriptions as used for the Mag-
neticum simulations (see Hirschmann et al. (2014); Dolag et al.
(2016)). This first paper in a series mainly introduces the general
properties, based on the simulation following galaxy formation
processes and therefore a realistic galaxy population is present in
the simulations as well as galaxy clusters with proper intraclus-
ter medium (ICM) properties. Therefore, galaxies together with
the population of galaxy clusters can be directly compared by
the same means to the observed counterparts. This also allows
us to study the e ffects of the local environment on observational
properties and their cosmological impact.
However, comparing clusters from constrained simulations
with their observational counterparts need a cross-identification,
which itself is subject to evaluating di fferences in observed and
simulated positions and masses. Such di fferences in positions
have di fferent origins. Simulations performing density recon-
struction based on redshift survey typically need to apply a rela-
tively large smoothing (e.g. 5-10 Mpc as in the case of CORUS-
CANT) to the reconstructed density field, while the bulk velocity
with which the halo is moving over cosmic time is largely uncon-
strained and leads to additional displacement of the halo in the
simulation. In simulations based on peculiar velocities, uncer-
tainties from distance moduli are propagating to radial veloci-
ties and, when applying Poisson equation, propagate further into
uncertainties on the reconstructed density /total velocity field.
Therefore uncertainties in the observed distance (which could be
as large as several tenth of Mpc for distant clusters) are coupled
directly with displacements of the three dimensional positions
within the evolved simulation.
To give a better impression on the di fferences in some of
the constrained simulations, we show the predicted distribution
of galaxies from the three simulations SLOW (upper panel),
SIBELIUS and SALACIOUS (middle panels) compared to the
galaxies from the 2MRS catalog (lower panel) in figure 1. In ad-
dition, the positions of Coma, Perseus and Virgo within the sim-
ulations and observations are shown. In general, the environment
of these clusters are similar in the di fferent simulations (like the
large scale structure leaving Perseus to the lower left, or the hor-izontal structures leaving Virgo and Coma. However, the details
in these structures are di fferent as well as there are striking di ffer-
ences between the massive clusters and their immediate environ-
ment. In SLOW /CLONES for example, the immediate outskirts
of Perseus indicate a quite fossil, relax system with a mass which
is very close to that expected from observations, where Perseus
is characterized by a strong cool-core feature which is associated
with overall relaxed systems (see Fabian et al. 1981; Böhringer
et al. 1993). In contrast, within the CORUSCANT /SALACIOUS
simulation the Perseus structure appears as a twin system with an
even more massive companion, while in the SIBELIUS simula-
tion Perseus appears to be three times too massive. The obtained
virial masses of these clusters in the di fferent simulations and
their positions are listed in table 1, where we also listed the ob-
servational findings. For the masses, we converted all values to
the same mass definition using the scaling relations given in Ra-
gagnin et al. (2021) and (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016a).
3. Simulations
3.1. Magneticum simulations
TheMagneticum5Simulations follow for the first time the evo-
lution of up to 1011particles in a series of hydro-dynamical
simulations of cosmological volumes ranging in size from (68
Mpc)3to almost (4 Gpc)3. To evaluate the significance of fea-
tures in the local Universe, we use the largest simulation vol-
ume, Box0 /mrof the Magneticum simulation set as reference for
the general presence of such features within the ΛCDM cosmo-
logical model. This simulation covers a box of 2.688 h−1GPc in
size, resolved with a total of 2 ×45363dark matter and gas res-
olution elements, having a mass resolution of 1 .3×1010h−1M⊙
and 2.6×109h−1M⊙respectively and featuring full galaxy for-
mation physics. It is therefore well equipped to reflect galaxy
cluster and group properties. Having ≈150 times the volume
of the 500 h−1Mpc box, Box0 /mrof the Magneticum simula-
tions allow us to compare a large number of random patches
with the constrained part of the SLOW simulation with a very
high statistical significance. The cosmology adopted for these
simulations is slightly di fferent than for SLOW, as it follows
the WMAP7 from Komatsu et al. (2011), with Hubble constant
H0=70.4km/s/Mpc, a total matter density of ΩMatter =0.272,
a cosmological constant of ΩΛ=0.728 and a baryon fraction

malisation of the power spectrum of σ8=0.809 and a slope of
the primordial fluctuation spectra of n=0.963. However, these
small di fferences do not play any significant role for the compar-
isons presented in this study.
3.2. The sub-grid model used
Both, the SLOW as well as the Magneticum simulations are us-
ing an updated formulation of SPH (Beck et al. 2016) with mod-
ern, high order Kernels (Dehnen & Aly 2012) and include the
treatment of the relevant models to describe the physical pro-
cesses needed for galaxy formation like cooling, star formation
and winds. This is based on the multi-phase model (Springel &
Hernquist 2003), but extended to follow in detail the stellar pop-
ulation and chemical enrichment by SN-Ia, SN-II, AGB (Torna-
tore et al. 2003, 2007), uses metal depending cooling tables from
Wiersma et al. (2009) and a galactic wind velocity of 350 km /s
for the kinetic feedback. Another important aspect to follow are
the evolution of super massive black holes and the associated
AGN feedback, where we follow (Springel et al. 2005) with var-
ious improvements (Fabjan et al. 2010; Hirschmann et al. 2014)
for the treatment of the black hole sink particles and the di fferent
feedback modes. Importantly for the treatment of the ICM they
include isotropic thermal conduction of 1 /20 of standard Spitzer
value (Dolag et al. 2004b) and a low viscosity scheme to track
turbulence (Dolag et al. 2005b; Beck et al. 2016).
It has been intensively demonstrated, that this sub-grid
model leads to galaxy and ICM properties in galaxy clusters,
which largely follow the observational trends and properties.
Thereby, the Magneticum simulations have been compared to
Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) data from Planck (Planck Collabora-
tion et al. 2013a) and SPT (McDonald et al. 2014). It has been
demonstrated to reproduce the observable X-ray luminosity-
relation (Bi ffiet al. 2013), the chemical composition (Dolaget al. 2017; Bi ffiet al. 2018b) of the ICM and the high con-
centration observed in fossil groups (Ragagnin et al. 2019). On
larger scales, the Magneticum simulations demonstrated to re-
produce the observed SZ power spectrum Dolag et al. (2016)
as well as the observed thermal history of the Universe (Young
et al. 2021) and the gas properties in between galaxy clusters
(Biffiet al. 2022). On galaxy scales, the simulations lead to an
overall successful reproduction of the basic galaxy properties,
like the stellar mass function at low (Naab & Ostriker 2017) and
high (Lustig et al. 2023; Remus et al. 2022) redshifts, the envi-
ronmental impact of galaxy clusters on galaxy properties (Lotz
et al. 2019; Lustig et al. 2023), the azimuthal distribution of mat-
ter around clusters compared with findings in SDSS (Gouin et al.
2020) and the appearance of post-starburst galaxies (Lotz et al.
2021) as well as the associated AGN population at various red-
shifts (Hirschmann et al. 2014; Steinborn et al. 2016; Bi ffiet al.
2018a).
3.3. SLOW
The large-scale structure of the Universe is e ffectively described
by the (peculiar) velocity and real space distribution of observ-
able galaxies. A Wiener Filter (WF) algorithm6is needed to re-
construct the true underlying cosmography from the noisy and
incomplete galaxy data reaped from surveys. The first attempt
to construct constrained realizations of Gaussian random fields
subject to linear constraints was made by Ho ffman & Ribak
(1991). In the intervening two decades the technique as well as
the input constraints have been refined – peculiar velocity, in fact
distance modulus, surveys such as CosmicFlows-2 (CF2, Tully
et al. 2013) are particularly useful since the cosmic velocity field
is directly related to the matter density field in the linear regime.
Wiener Filter reconstructions of CF2 have already been carried

et al. 1995, 1999).

Fig. 3. The di fferent panels show observations in di fferent wavebands. From top to down: distribution of galaxies in the 2MRS catalog, X-ray
surface brightness in the ROSAT’s 1.5 keV band (R6 +R7=0.76-2.04 keV) and Compton-Y map based on Planck data (produced with the MILCA
algorithm Planck Collaboration et al. 2016b) with the CO mask by Khatri (2016). The inlays in addition show a zoom on the Perseus and Hercules
regions. The labels in the inlays are giving the Name together with radial velocity (in km /s) as redshift distance indicator. The yellow labels are
indicating clusters which are outside the slice used in the simulations shown in figure 4.

surface brightness and Compton- Y. We used here a much larger dynamical ranges than in the observations shown on figure 3 for the color scaling
to emphasize the large angular imprint on the very local galaxy clusters. Note also that we here always show the full simulation volume, out to a
distance of 350 Mpc. The inlays in addition show a zoom on the Perseus and Hercules regions. Here we used a much more narrow range around
Perseus and A2147, e.g. a 10 respectively 40 Mpc thick region to emphasize the local structures. The labels in the inlays are giving the virial mass
(inM⊙) of the haloes, together with radial velocity (in km /s) as redshift distance indicator.

out successfully estimating the density field within ∼100 Mpc
(e.g. Laniakea, Tully et al. 2014). Sorce (2018) describes in de-
tails the steps of the method to build the constrained initial con-
ditions and introduces those used in this paper. The main steps
are summarized hereafter:
1. Before deriving the peculiar velocities, grouping (Sorce &
Tempel 2018) of the distance modulus catalog to remove
non-linear virial motions that would a ffect the linear recon-
struction obtained with the linear method (e.g. Sorce et al.
(2017); Sorce & Tempel (2017)). Typically, when several
distance moduli are available for several galaxies within the
same galaxy cluster, they are replaced by the distance mod-
ulus of the cluster.
2. Minimizing the biases (Sorce 2015) inherent to any obser-
vational radial peculiar velocity catalog (e.g. Malmquist bi-
ases and lognormal error). An iterative algorithm permits
retrieving the Gaussian radial peculiar velocity distribution,
expected from the theory, from a flat distribution with large
tails. Additionally, uncertainties are derived for these new
peculiar velocities to filter the smoothing e ffect with the dis-
tance (dilution of the information with the distance) of the
subsequent algorithms (Sorce et al. 2016b; Sorce 2018).
3. Reconstructing the cosmic displacement field with the WF
technique applied to the peculiar velocity constraints.
4. Accounting for the cosmic displacement by relocating con-
straints to the positions of their progenitors using the Re-
verse Zel’dovich Approximation and the reconstructed cos-
mic displacement field (Doumler et al. 2013c,a,b) and re-
placing noisy radial peculiar velocities by their WF 3D re-
constructions (Sorce et al. 2014).
5. Producing density fields constrained by the modified obser-
vational peculiar velocities combined with a random realiza-
tion to restore statistically the missing structures using the
Constrained Realization technique (CR, Ho ffman & Ribak
1991, 1992).
6. Rescaling the density fields to build constrained initial con-
ditions7, where increasing the resolution implies adding ran-
dom small scale features.
Here, as well as for the actual simulations, we assume the
standard, ΛCDM cosmological model with the Hubble con-
stant H0=67.77km/s/Mpc, a total matter density of ΩMatter =
0.307115, a cosmological constant of ΩΛ=0.692885 and a
baryon fraction corresponding to Ωbaryon =0.0480217, as well
as an overall normalisation of the power spectrum of σ8=0.829
and a slope of the primordial fluctuation spectra of n=0.961
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2014).
3.4. SLOW set of simulations
To create the initial conditions, SLOW use the CLONE-
500 Mpc /h-5123grid, realization number 8, to which di fferent
small scale features for di fferent resolutions are added with G in-
nungagap . Simulations are then performed with di fferent levels
of additional physics:
–Dark matter only simulations were performed using 7683,
15763, 30723and 61443particles.
–Magneto-hydrodynamical, non radiative simulations but fol-
lowing also a cosmic ray component (Böss et al. 2023) using
2×30723gas and dark matter particles.

using 2 ×7683, 2×15763and 2 ×30723gas and dark matter
particles (last one only down to z=2).
Halos are identified using S ubFind(Springel et al. 2001;
Dolag et al. 2009) which detects halos based on the standard
Friends-of-Friends algorithm (Davis et al. 1985) and subhalos as
self-bound regions around local density peaks within the main
halos. The centre of halos and subhalos are defined as the posi-
tion of the particle with the (local) minimum of the gravitational
potential. The virial mass, Mviris defined through the spherical-
overdensity around a halo as predicted by the generalised spheri-
cal top-hat collapse model (Eke et al. 1996) with an over-density
for the chosen cosmology following Bryan & Norman (1998).
For subhaloes, individual properties are computed based on the
particles which are associated to the individual subhalos. To
compute the K-band magnitudes in our simulation which include
galaxy formation physics, we used the K-band stellar mass to
light ratio as obtained from SDSS (Bell et al. 2003)
log10(M/LK)=−0.42+0.033log10(Mh2/M⊙), (1)
while in the case of dark matter only simulations, we are using
the corresponding Tully-Fisher relation based on the maximum
circular velocity computed within the subhaloes.
4. A qualitative comparison with observations
Within the SLOW simulations, more than 40 local clusters have
been cross identified with their observational counterpart, show-
ing good agreement in global properties (like total mass) as well
as profiles of the ICM properties (like pressure and temperature),
see Hernández-Martínez et al. (in prep) for details. All the results
presented in this paper are based on the hydrodynamical, full
galaxy formation simulation with 2 ×15763particles. In Figure 2
we show the distribution of the dark matter within the SLOW
simulation as a full sky map up to a distance of 350 Mpc, where
the color coding is according to the total matter content in each
pixel. This shows how the constrained region of the local Uni-
verse (where we labeled a subset of the cross identified clusters)
is embedded in the larger cosmological structures. In Figure 3
we show a collection of observations. First, we show the distri-
bution of galaxies in the 2MRS catalog. Note that here the obser-
vations are limited to more local galaxies as the 2MRS gets very
sparse at distances beyond 100 Mpc. On the other hand, X-ray
and Compton- Ymap contain significant foreground and other,
non-cluster related emission. Here the selection of the 1.5 keV
(R6+R7=0.76-2.04 keV) band for the X-ray surface brightness
map, based on the data of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS,
Snowden et al. 1997), maximises the visibility of the cluster sig-
nal. In the Compton- Ymap, the exclusion of regions with signif-
icant CO emission (according to the mask by Khatri 2016) from
thePlanck data (produced with the MILCA algorithm Planck
Collaboration et al. 2016b) is reducing the non-cluster related
foreground. Therefore one has to keep in mind that both obser-
vational tracers contain objects which are outside the distance
range of the simulation counterparts (some prominent ones are
marked with yellow labels), and even some much more distant
objects, even outside the simulation volume, as well as residuals
of local, galactic foreground features and are limited on the faint
end by the observational noise. This can be compared with the
according counterparts as derived from the simulation, shown in
figure 4. Here we show the distribution of the stellar component
(upper panel), the X-ray surface brightness (middle panel) and
the Compton- Ymap (lower panel) as obtained from the SLOW

simulation. The maps are created from the simulations using
SMAC (Dolag et al. 2005a), where for the X-ray map the emis-
sivity for each SPH particle is computed following Bartelmann
& Steinmetz (1996). Here we can use a much larger dynami-
cal ranges in the color scaling to emphasize the large angular
imprint on the very local galaxy clusters. Also here we always
used the full simulation volume out to the distance of 350 Mpc
for producing the counterpart sky maps from the simulations. In
addition, we show two special regions (Perseus and Hercules)
in more detail in the inlays. Therefore we always center on the
cross identified halo of the prominent cluster (e.g. Perseus and
A2147) and used a much more narrow range around them, e.g.
a 10 respectively 40 Mpc, to emphasize the local structures. The
virial mass (in solar masses) are given as labels for the cross
identified halos, while in addition the radial velocity (in km /s)
is given as a distance indicator. A more detailed comparison of
the individual cluster properties across multiple wavebands will
be released in a series of papers. In table 1 we give the virial
masses for Coma, Virgo and Perseus as a reference. As can be
seen when comparing the full sky maps from the observations
and the simulations, uncertainties in the constrains which went
into the construction of the initial condition lead to a noticeable
shift in the positions (see also Sorce 2018). The largest con-
tribution to this positional discrepancies are the still relatively
large uncertainties in the observed distance modules. This gets
even more evident when comparing the inlays. For example in
the Hercules region, A2147 has a clear match and also A2107has a corresponding halo. There is also a halo resembling the
A2063 /A2052 complex, but this is only a single halo in the sim-
ulation and shows also a significant shift (e.g. several degrees on
sky). A similar situation arises for the Perseus region. Perseus
itself has a quite well matching counterpart, however, a possible
counterpart to AWM7 is already significantly displaced. Never-
theless, this comparison across multiple wavebands clearly re-
veals that appearance of clusters can look significantly di fferent
across the di fferent wavebands and demonstrate the need of full,
hydro dynamical simulations for such comparison, as the appar-
ent significance of structures often largely di ffers when compar-
ing galaxy and ICM properties. Still, overall clear similarities
in the large scale structure and the appearance of galaxy clus-
ters are visible across the di fferent wavebands when comparing
the SLOW simulations with the observations, confirming Sorce
(2018) and Sorce et al. (2023) assertions.
5. Mean density for Halos in SLOW
There are various density anomalies reported in the Local Uni-
verse, ranging from the Council of Giants (McCall 2014), the lo-
cal void (Tully & Fisher 1987), close structures, a local deficit of
galaxy clusters (Böhringer et al. 2020) and an overabundance of
very massive galaxy clusters like Norma, Perseus, Coma, Ophi-
uchus and A2199 or A119. As SLOW is a constrained simula-
tion, based on peculiar velocity observations, we can investigate
how these structures are present in the predicted density field.
Article number, page 9 of 16A&A proofs: manuscript no. aanda
Given the large volume of (500 h−1Mpc)3covered by the sim-
ulation, we can investigate the full range of observed anoma-
lies, given the resolution one can nowadays reach for such vol-
umes. Having a full galaxy formation physics run allows also
distinguishing between the dark matter density field, halos and
galaxies, including observational properties like stellar mass for
galaxies and properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) within
galaxy clusters like their temperature, X-ray luminosity and
more.
Figure 5 shows the cumulative number density within
spheres with growing radius centered on the position of the MW.
Here the left panel is using the distribution of halos with dif-
ferent lower limits in their virial mass as indicated by the leg-
end, while the right panel uses the galaxies (e.g. sub-halos) with
different lower limits in stellar mass. In both cases the spacing
of the lines corresponds to a change in the mass threshold of
∆log10(M)=0.05. The solid black line is obtained directly from
the dark matter particles within the simulation.
Several features are immediately visible. Starting with a
quite empty region within the very close vicinity around the MW
position8, there are several relatively massive galaxies at a dis-
tance of 5 Mpc, which build the equivalent of the so called Coun-
cil of Giants, which are observed at ≈3.75 Mpc (McCall 2014).
After that, the local void is clearly visible and filling the space
till the Virgo galaxy cluster at ≈16 Mpc and the associated super
cluster (the Virgo super cluster) comes into place. Then, between
≈30 and 140 Mpc, a clear under density is present in all tracers,
except the very massive galaxies and massive galaxy clusters,
which is in agreement with our findings based on the halo mass
functions as presented in (Sorce et al. 2016b). he high start of
the blue, upper lines reflect the fact that we have a very massive
cluster like Virgo very close. Note that a typical, mean sepa-
ration of clusters with a virial mass of 1015M⊙is≈180 Mpc.
These lines stay high, as we approach other very massive clus-
ters (among them Perseus and Coma) well before the distance
reflecting the mean density of such systems. The main obstacle
in relating the density of tracers to the underlying dark matter
distribution depends on the physics of gravitational clustering
and the more complex physics of galaxy formation and is often
referred generically as "bias" (see for example Weinberg et al.
2004, and references therein). It is interesting to note that the
bias between the tracer population and the dark matter for the
galaxy population in the normal mass-range shows the expected,
regular behaviour with only mild dependency on actual mass. In
contrast, the bias using halos shows a strong mass dependency
and also large fluctuations in relative amplitude when comparing
halos to the dark matter distribution. It is equally interesting to
note that the factor of 2 over-density associated with the Virgo
supercluster structure as seen in dark matter shows only up in
galaxies and only if galaxies down to stellar masses of at least
1011M⊙are used and does not show up in the halo number den-
sity distribution at all. This means that in this case, the halo of
the Virgo clusters seems generally quite isolated and therefore
the halo itself traces the general over-density, but not the asso-
ciated structures in the environment. At the very high mass end,
galaxies and halos align, which just reflects that the central, very
massive galaxies (BCGs) are strictly related to massive galaxy
clusters and their halo, marking the point where galaxies of a
certain mass can no longer be formed by internal processes but
mainly grow by (mostly dry) mergers.
8Here we defined the position of the MW in this realization, so that
the Virgo cluster is exactly at the correct position.6. Comparison to Observations
As discussed in the previous section, the di fferent features in the
Local Universe can be compared more directly to observations
to understand better how unique our Local Universe is. Figure 6
shows the comparison to di fferent observational tracers as dis-
cussed in the following sub-sections in detail.
6.1. X-ray cluster sample
The upper panel of figure 6 compares the results from the SLOW
simulation to the findings by Böhringer et al. (2020), who re-
ported a 50% under-density of X-ray selected galaxy cluster
from the CLASSIX catalogue (shown as blue data points). The
luminosity cut of 1042erg/s in the (0.1-2.4) keV band translates
into a virial mass of ≈1013.4M⊙when using a canonical X-
ray luminosity-mass relation (Böhringer et al. 2014). The blue
solid line resembles the result from the SLOW simulation for ha-
los with this mass threshold, nicely reproducing the data points.
However, having a full hydro-dynamical simulation we can also
directly use the predicted X-ray luminosity of the clusters in the
simulations. Here, we started from the predicted bolometric lu-
minosity within R500cand applied the correction for the used en-
ergy band based on the mass weighted T500cof the cluster. When
applying the X-ray luminosity cut to the simulated clusters, we
get the dashed line, which is very close to the one where we used
the virial mass cut to select the clusters. This shows that the ob-
served signal in the simulation – and therefore also the signal
in the real data – is not driven by the X-ray selection of galaxy
clusters.
Given this signal, it is interesting to investigate how pe-
culiar it is to have a local environment which features such a
50% under-density within the given volume. Therefore, we took
the very large, general cosmological simulation from the Mag-
neticum simulations set, namely Box0 /mr, which covers a vol-
ume of (2688 h−1Mpc)3. Here we randomly selected more than
fifteen thousand points within the volume, and computed the cu-
mulative over-density profiles out to 360 Mpc radius. The gray
shaded regions mark the one, two and three sigma regions occu-
pied by these profiles from a random cosmological simulation.
The black solid line is the median of the distribution to indi-
cate the statistical error left due to the still somewhat limited
sample size from the large simulation. We clearly see that the
under-density we live in is not very uncommon in the cosmo-
logical sense, representing a ≈1.5 sigma event, similar to what
Sorce et al. (2016b) concluded from comparing the halo mass
function.
6.2. Massive galaxy clusters
Although we are living in a large scale under-dense region, there
are several very massive galaxy clusters within that region, ex-
ceeding virial masses of 1015M⊙, among them Coma, Perseus
and Ophiuchus. Using the five closest galaxy clusters from the
Tully galaxy groups catalogue (Tully 2015) with masses above
1015M⊙, the middle part of figure 6 shows that this corresponds
to a very large over-density in the Local Universe (blue dia-
monds). We also selected the five closest galaxy clusters from
the BAX9database with X-ray measured temperatures exceed-
ing 5 keV and showing them as red triangles in the figure, ba-
sically confirming the presence of an overdensity of high mass
systems. Selecting such clusters predicted by the SLOW simula-

(2004), respectively. Bottom panel, comparing our simulated galaxies
with the results on the stellar mass density presented in Karachentsev &

the according 1,2 and 3 σlines obtained from the Magneticum simula-
tion and the black line marks the median (to display the cosmic variance
left).tion (blue line for the mass selection, red line for the temperature
selection) again follows the observational data points extremely
well, confirming this significant overdensity of massive clusters,
as it was already clearly visible in figure 5. Note that there is
a large overlap between the selected clusters when switching
the selection criteria in both, observations (4 /5) and simulations
(3/5). Note that the closest cluster in the simulation exceeding
1015M⊙is at a distance of ≈40Mpc (as can be seen from figure
5). Furthermore, many of these prominent, massive /hot clusters
can be cross identified between the simulations and observations,
among them Perseus, Coma, A119 and A85, even show very
similar virial masses and temperatures (see Sorce 2018; Sorce
et al. 2023, and for more details Hernández-Martínez et al. in
prep). Only Norma and Ophiuchus are not very well reproduced
in the simulations, due to their position in /close to the zone of
avoidance, where no data are available. Nevertheless, there is
a significant overlap between the two sets of most massive /
hot clusters in simulations and observations. Therefore we ex-
pect similar properties of the clusters in both sets as was already
shown for example for the Virgo cluster (Sorce et al. 2021).
Again we investigate the statistical significance of such ex-
cess of massive systems. Here, the gray shaded regions again
mark the one, two and three sigma regions as obtained from the
large cosmological simulation Box0 /mrfrom the Magneticum
set. The comparison indicates that such excess in massive sys-
tem is approximately a 1.5 sigma coincidence. The black line
marks the median from the 15635 samples we used and gives an
indication on the remaining statistical uncertainty, which in this
case is somewhat larger due to the general low number density
of such massive galaxy clusters.
One might speculate, that the general under-density of clus-
ters might be related to the over-density of massive systems,
however, a closer investigation based on Box0 /mrindicates the
opposite. In fact, when requiring a very conservative limit to
have at 90 Mpc a mean density below 0.65 for clusters with vi-
ral masses of ≈1013.4M⊙and having an over-density of massive
systems of 2.3 at 160 Mpc (corresponding to the observational
value of the the closest system), we find only 44 out of the 15635
samples to match. This corresponds to a more than 3 σcase. Be-
sides, it clearly demonstrates that these two peculiarities of the
local Universe are not related.
It is also worth noticing that in addition, at distances between
≈(240−330)Mpc, the simulation predict a ∼(20−30)% over-
density of massive galaxy clusters, as visible in the middle panel
of figure 6 as well as in the left panel of 5. Also at these distances,
which are beyond the radial distance for which peculiar veloc-
ities are mainly constrained, some of the very massive galaxy
clusters can be cross matched between simulations and observa-
tions, among them A3266 for example, which is also labeled in
figure 3 and 4.
6.3. Galaxies
Finally we can also compare the density fields as traced with
galaxies, as this might be closer to the actual, underlying distri-
bution of dark matter, as shown in the previous section. Here,
in the lower panel of figure 6 we compare the stellar mass in
all simulated galaxies in SLOW (solid blue line) with observed
stellar density as reported in (Karachentsev & Telikova 2018).
Here the red band correspond to the overall mean stellar den-
sity reported in Karachentsev & Telikova (2018), normalized to
the global stellar density of Ω∗=0.0027 (Fukugita & Peebles
2004) or to the value at the largest distance. The orange and
the dark orange bands correspond to the observed stellar density

for the northern and southern (Karachentsev & Telikova 2018),
normalized to these two general values respectively. In addition,
the blue dashed line marks the relative, mean number density
of galaxies with M∗>1010M⊙, while the gray line is the rela-
tive dark matter density. Comparing to the expectations from the
SLOW simulation in both cases matched the large over-density
feature of factor ≈2 of the local structures associated with the
Virgo cluster at distances around ≈16 Mpc quite well. It also
shows a very similar shape further out with two minima and two
maxima, although the first under-density in the simulation ap-
pears at a distance of ≈40 Mpc, while in the observations the
minimum in the relative density is at ≈55 Mpc. As seen in com-
parison with the dark matter density, these features are clearly di-
rectly related to the underlying dark matter density field. Closer
than the distance to Virgo, the simulations show a very promi-
nent, large under-density of the local void (already visible in fig-
ure 5, however, the stellar density as reported in Karachentsev
& Telikova (2018) features a larger, local density. Interestingly
to note, the SLOW simulation predict a global stellar density
ofΩ∗=0.0031, which is close to the value of Ω∗=0.0027
as reported in Fukugita & Peebles (2004). In general, the good
match of the gray line for the dark matter density in the bottom
panel with the observed as well as the simulated stellar density
at distances beyond ≈20 Mpc indicates that the observed stellar
densities obtained from galaxies quite robustly trace the under-
lying dark matter field, which is not the case when using galaxy
clusters as tracers, as shown in the previous sub-sections.
6.4. Anisotropies
As mentioned in the introduction, the local structures also lead to
observed non isotropic distribution of tracers of the large scale
structures. Here we want to compare the results of the SLOW
simulations with two of these reported features. In figure 7 we
compare the distribution of galaxy clusters in the simulations to
the pancake like structure out to a scale of ≈100 Mpc as reported
in Böhringer et al. (2021). We follow the characterization of the
Fig. 8. Comparison of our simulated galaxies with the results on the
stellar mass density presented in Karachentsev & Telikova (2018) di-
vided in the Northern Galactic hemisphere (blue) and Southern Galac-
tic hemisphere (red). As comparison, the thinner, dark red dashed and
dotted dashed line show the result when splitting along super galactic
SGX and SGZ coordinates.
flattened superstructure as in the observations. Starting from a
cylinder with 100 Mpc radius, centered at the MW position and
oriented along the supergalactic SGY direction, we compute the
over-density within slices of thickness ±w1/2Mpc and compare
this with the mean density of the same objects within a sphere of
100 Mpc radius, centred on the MW. To mimic the observational
selection of clusters we selected clusters either by their X-ray
luminosity (e.g. 1042erg/s as in the observations) or by the ac-
cording virial mass (e.g. Mvir=1013.4M⊙) as shown by the blue
and black solid line respectively. This qualitatively agrees well
with the observational data points (blue symbols with error bars)
which are also shown. In addition, the blue dashed and dashed-
dotted lines show the dependence on the luminosity threshold
used, indicating that choosing a slightly larger luminosity would
increase the agreement with the observational data further. To
further strengthen this result, the red dashed and dotted-dashed
lines are showing the absence (or even reverse signal) obtained
when doing the split along the supergalactic SGZ and SGX co-
ordinate, respectively. We can conclude here, that the pancake
like structure is a solid prediction by the SLOW simulation and
well aligns qualitatively with the observational finding without
fine tuning selection parameters.
In figure 8, we repeat the comparison of the stellar density
within the Local Universe with the finding of Karachentsev &
Telikova (2018), where a large di fferences between the Northern
and Southern Galactic hemisphere was reported. Splitting our
galaxies from the SLOW simulation in the same way (red and
blue solid line) the SLOW simulation shows some features very
similar to the observations (red and blue bands). Clearly, there
is an over respectively under density present in the northern re-
spectively southern hemisphere at large distances. This qualita-
tively agrees with observations, although here the quantitative
agreement is not as good as for the pancake like structure traced
by galaxy clusters. Also here we add in addition a split along
the super-galactic x and z coordinate (dashed and dashed-dotted
lines) to show the dependence of the signal onto the directional
split. As seen before, the lower stellar density within the SLOW
simulation out to a distance of ≈15 Mpc is present and inde-
pendent on the direction. Interestingly the split along the super-

galactic x coordinate follows the observations even better and
may indicate that the positional uncertainty of some prominent
structure in the simulated Local Universe might influence the ac-
tual selection and might be worth further studies.
7. Conclusions
We presented the first results from a long standing initiative, to
perform hydrodynamical, cosmological simulations of the Local
Universe (a) with high enough resolution and detailed enough
galaxy formation physics to reproduce reliable galaxies as well
as intracluster medium properties; (b) which extends to large dis-
tances to properly cover the transition of the local structures to-
wards the cosmological average properties; (c) to be constructed
not on total density estimates based on galaxy densities in red-
shift surveys. The latter makes the comparisons with the ob-
served galaxy distribution and galaxy clusters properties inde-
pendent from observations, that where already used to construct
the constraints for the initial condition and also allow to better
compare their evolution. Initial conditions of our SLOW sim-
ulation are based on peculiar velocities (more precisely, a com-
plex interplay and combination of observed redshift and distance
modulus from the CosmicFlows-2 catalogue), applying various
improvements in their creation over the last years (Sorce & Tem-
pel 2018; Sorce 2020) leading to a simulation which captures
a volume of (500 h−1Mpc)3in which various clusters of the
Local Universe can be cross identified (see Sorce (2018) and
Hernández-Martínez et al, in prep, for details).
The predicted density field of the simulation shows various
distinct features and indicates that the Local Universe transits
into the cosmic mean at distance of ≈200 Mpc (with signifi-
cant variances depending on the tracers used). Within this region,
several ranges with relative under- and over-density are present,
which can be compared to observational indications. Especially
we find that
1. Up to the distance of Virgo cluster (i.e. ≈16 Mpc), the
SLOW simulation predicts the mean dark matter density in
the Local Universe to be at ≈0.5 of the mean value. With
the Virgo super cluster this transits into a factor of two over-
density region until ≈30 Mpc, after which the Local Uni-
verse seems to be ≈20% under-dense out to ≈200 Mpc.
2. While this is traced by normal galaxies within the simulation
with an expected bias of order of 30%, using halos or galaxy
clusters can result in quite di fferent, sometimes even opposite
conclusions, depending on the halo mass cut.
3. Applying the same mass (or alternatively X-ray luminosity)
cut like the CLASSIX galaxy cluster sample, the simulation
very closely reproduces the observed 50% under-density of
galaxy clusters in the Local Universe.
4. Using clusters with virial masses above 1015M⊙, simulation
and observations consistently show a significant over-density
of such objects within the same volume out to ≈200 Mpc
within the Local Universe. In addition, at distances between
≈(240−330) Mpc, the simulation predicts a ≈(20−30)%
over-density of such massive galaxy clusters.
5. Comparing with hydro-dynamical simulations of very large
cosmological volumes, we find that both these features indi-
vidually are not such uncommon and correspond to ≈18%
of cases (e.g. fall into the ≈1.5 sigma region). However, they
appear to be unrelated to each other and the combination is
only found in ≈0.28% of random selections from our (4
Gpc)3reference simulation Box0 /mrof the Magneticum sim-
ulation set, and therefore would correspond to a three sigma
case).6. The SLOW simulation also shows the pancake-like distribu-
tion of galaxy clusters within 100 Mpc of the Local Universe
Böhringer et al. (2021). Thereby the radial distribution of
the number counts of galaxy clusters follows quite closely
the observations when splitting in super-galactic north /south
direction.
7. The SLOW simulation predicts a global stellar density of
Ω∗=0.0031, which is close to the value of Ω∗=0.0027
as reported in Fukugita & Peebles (2004). At distances
larger than ≈15 Mpc the stellar density obtained from the
SLOW simulation follows the one reported in Karachentsev
& Telikova (2018) remarkably well and confirms both, the
large, relative over-density induced by Virgo as well as the
≈20% under-density beyond distances of 100 Mpc.
8. At distances between ≈15 and 100 Mpc, the predicted stel-
lar density in the slow SLOW simulation shows also quali-
tatively similar di fference between the northern and south-
ern Galactic hemisphere than reported in Karachentsev &
Telikova (2018).
The presented SLOW simulation of the Local Universe re-
produces some of the main features of the local density field and
therefore opens a new window for local field cosmology. It al-
lows us to better verify and interpret observations of the local
structures and their tracers. In future this will allow us to evalu-
ate in detail the imprint of the specific density field of the Local
Universe on the local estimations of cosmological parameters
like H 0as well detailed studies of the imprint of the formation
history on actual properties of galaxy clusters.

Fig. A.1. Cumulative, relative dark matter density as function of dis-
tance from the MW position as obtained from the SLOW (black), COR-
USCANT (blue), early CLUES (red) and SIBELIUS (orange) simula-
tion.
Appendix A: Comparison to other simulations
Here we present some comparison with other, previous or more
recent constrained simulations, like CORUSCANT (Dolag et al.
2004a) and its SALACIOUS variant (Kawahara et al. 2007)
which includes galaxy formation physics, the early CLUES
(Klypin et al. 2003) simulation (label as B160_WM3) as well
as the SIBELIUS (McAlpine et al. 2022) simulation.
Appendix A.1: Dark matter distribution
Similar to figure 5, figure A.1 shows the dark matter den-
sity in the Local Universe but comparing di fferent simulation:
SLOW, CORUSCANT, B160_WM3 and SIBELIUS. Although
for SIBELIUS the dark matter data are not publicly available,
the dark matter profiles where provided by McAlpine on our re-
quest. All simulations show the over density related to the Virgo
complex, however, SIBELIUS shows only a very mild signal. On
the other hand, SIBELIUS shows a significant under density at
scales of 30-60 Mpc, while only SLOW shows the large scale un-
der density towards a distance of 100 Mpc. For B160_WM3 and
CORUSCANT this is mainly because the volume of these sim-
ulations cover a too small volume, while there is a very tiny un-
der density visible in SIBELIUS. However, B160_WM3 shows
a significant over density within a spherical region of 100 Mpc
radius. Interestingly, both, SLOW and B160_WM3 show a clear
local under density in dark matter within 10 Mpc, while COR-
USCANT shows a larger over density in this region.
Appendix A.2: Galaxy cluster distribution
Similar to figure 6, in figure A.2 we show the density of galaxy
clusters in the Local Universe as obtained from the di fferent
simulations, divided into massive (blue) and all clusters (red),
compared to the observational data points. While in SLOW and
B160_WM3 reproducing the high number of local, very mas-
sive system, CORUSCANT and SIBELIUS are falling some-
what short in having the unusual large number of such massive
systems. Note however that this is not really significant, given
the low number of halos in this case. However, when compar-
Fig. A.2. Equivalent to top and middle panel of figure 6 but for the dif-
ferent simulations, showing the cumulative, relative cluster density as
function of distance from the MW position as obtained from the SLOW
(solid), CORUSCANT (dashed), SIBELIUS (long dashed) and early
CLUES (dashed dotted) simulation. The blue lines are for very massive
halos, the red line are for clusters and correspond to the observations
from the CLASSIX Böhringer et al. (2020) sample.
ing to the CLASSIX sample, only SLOW is able to match the
reported significant under density out to a distance of 100 Mpc.
Appendix A.3: Galaxy density profiles
Finally we repeat the right panel of figure 5 for SIBELIUS (left
panel) and SALACIOUS (right panel) in figure A.3. Shown is
(as before) the mean density of galaxies as function of distance
for di fferent stellar masses, as indicated in the color bar. Note,
that from this we obtain a Ω∗=0.0014 for SIBELIUS and
Ω∗=0.0021 for CORUSCANT, compared to Ω∗=0.0031 for
SLOW and the observed value of Ω∗=0.0027 as reported in
Fukugita & Peebles (2004). Compared to the SLOW simula-
tions, both simulations are displaying significant less of varia-
tion in the mean density, and especially the SIBELIUS does not
show one sided deviation from the mean density over very large
scales. As already discussed in figure A.2, SIBELIUS does not
show the large scale under density out to a distance of 100 Mpc,
as reported in the CLASSIX sample of galaxy clusters. Here it
gets clear, that contrary to SLOW, no galaxy or galaxy cluster se-
lection in SIBELIUS does feature this observed anomaly in the
Local Universe. Once more this demonstrates that the assump-
tion of a constant bias within reconstructions based on galaxy
densities limits the predictive power of the resulting constrained
simulations. The significant di fferences of the bias and its en-
vironmental dependency visible in simulations based on semi-
analytic modeling (like SIBELIUS) and the full hydrodynami-
cal simulations (like SLOW or CORUSCANT) emphasize that
this is a non-trivial obstacle for reconstructions of the local Uni-
verse. This can in principle be overcome with reconstructions
based on the observed velocity field, as demonstrated through
the SLOW simulation, which seems to match the observational
findings of various di fferent tracers of the large scale structure
very well. However, as shown, they come with their own obsta-
cles which are di fficult to overcome in a satisfactory manner, as
demonstrated by the overall e ffort which has been spent to bring
forward the constrained simulations to this point.

Fig. A.3. Same as right panel of figure 5 but for SIBELIUS (left panel) and SALACIOUS (right panel). Shown is the mean density of galaxies
within the Local Universe for di fferent stellar masses (as indicated in the color bar). Additionally the dark matter density is also shown in both
cases.
Appendix A.4: Weighting haloes by mass
We also tested if the mass weighting of haloes would result in
densities closer to the dark matter density, especially for the peak
created by the Virgo cluster region, where one could think that
in the case of using groups and clusters, this might give a better
result. The result is shown in figure A.4, which is identical to
the left part of figure 5, except that we used mass weighting to
compute the densities instead of number densities. Especially for
the nearby structures, like the local void and the peak dominated
by the Virgo cluster region, the mass weighting even overshoots
the feature. However, the mass weighting creates a very sharp
feature at a distance of ≈40 Mpc, even when using down to very
small haloes, which is similar to the sharp feature visible in the
stellar density at distance of ≈30 Mpc found by Karachentsev &
Telikova (2018) (see lower panel of figure 6), which is obtained
by integrating the observed stellar mass function.
Fig. A.4. Same as left panel of figure 5, but using mass weighting to
compute the density, instead of number density.
