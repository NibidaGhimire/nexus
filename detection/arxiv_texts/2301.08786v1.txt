Abstract
Lattice-based mechanical metamaterials are known to exhibit quite a unique
mechanical behavior owing to their rational internal architecture. This in-
cludes unusual properties such as a negative Poisson's ratio, which can be
easily tuned in reentrant-hexagonal metamaterials by adjusting the angles
between beams. However, changing the angles also aects the overall dimen-
sions of the unit cell. We show that by replacing traditional straight beams
with curved ones, it is possible to control the Poisson's ratio of reentrant-
hexagonal metamaterials without aecting their overall dimensions. While
the mechanical properties of these structures can be predicted through nite
element simulations or, in some cases, analytically, many applications require
to identify architectures with specic target properties. To solve this inverse
problem, we introduce a deep learning framework for generating metamateri-
als with desired properties. By supplying the generative model with a guide
structure in addition to the target properties, we are not only able to gen-
erate a large number of alternative architectures with the same properties,
but also to express preference for a specic shape. Deep learning predictions
together with experimental measurements prove that this approach allows us
to accurately generate unit cells tting specic properties for curved-beam
metamaterials.

The extreme mechanical properties and unique behavior of mechanical
metamaterials originate in their involved internal organization [39]. One of
the most well-known and well-studied manifestations of unusual behavior is a
negative Poisson's ratio in so-called auxetics [19]. In contrast to conventional
materials that shrink laterally while subjected to uniaxial tension, auxetic
materials undergo lateral expansion [30]. The key to the auxetic behavior
is hidden in the rational internal architecture often consisting of primitive
building blocks { unit cells. While it is possible to combine diverse unit cells
within the architecture to achieve specic macroscopic behavior [25, 37, 40],
traditional auxetic design is usually based on a single unit cell that repeats
itself in two or three dimensions [41]. In general, a wide variety of unit
cell designs (reentrant [20], chiral [29, 38], etc.) in 2D and 3D settings that
transform uniaxial elongation to lateral expansion were proposed. Moreover,
in 3D settings, unit cells can couple compression and twist deformations [6, 7].
It is important to notice, that while elastic constants such as the Poisson's
ratio were originally introduced for innitesimal deformations in isotropic
(or orthotropic) materials, a conceptually similar value connecting traversal
and lateral deformations has been actively employed to describe mechanical
behavior for large deformations [23] or for anisotropic metamaterials [24].
Assuming applicability of the Poisson's ratio for large deformations, it was
shown that it is possible to facilitate transition from positive to negative
Poisson's ratio via elastic buckling [22] or external non-mechanical stimuli
[12, 33] in mechanical metamaterials.
For traditional mechanical metamaterials [20, 29, 38], the geometry of the
unit cell univocally denes the overall mechanical behavior. Therefore, it is
enough to perform corresponding analysis only for a single unit cell assuming
periodic boundary conditions [26, 31]. For the classical reentrant-hexagonal
unit cell design shown in Fig. 1, analytical solutions for the stiness ma-
trix were obtained under the assumptions of Euler-Bernoulli or Timoshenko
beam formulations [9, 14, 27], or via other homogenization methods [4, 5].
In particular, it is established that the metamaterial demonstrates auxetic
behavior only if the corresponding angle is negative (Fig. 1b); otherwise,
the metamaterial possesses a positive Poisson's ratio (Fig. 1a). Harnessing
this dependency, metamaterials capable of reversibly switching their auxetic-
ity were realized with the help of stimuli-responsive materials embedded into
the architecture [33, 36].
2While the reentrant-hexagonal architecture provides an easy way for pro-
gramming its Poisson's ratio via alteration of the angle, such geometrical
change aects the overall size of the metamaterial. More specically, it is
impossible to obtain two distinct reentrant-hexagonal metamaterials with
dierent Poisson's ratios that simultaneously share the common overall di-
mensions and number of unit cells. In this manuscript, we will reveal how
minor modication of the reentrant-hexagonal architecture might enable a
very wide range of admissible Poisson's ratios while keeping the dimensions
of the unit cell constant. Instead of the classical unit cells shown in Fig. 1,
we will consider unit cells constructed with the help of curved beams.
The versatility of the design for non-straight beams and the resulting
intriguing interplay between their bending and lateral stinesses enable the
enriched potential for programming the behavior of mechanical metamateri-
als through a rational selection of the geometry of the unit cell [8, 28]. For
example, incorporating Bezier curves in designs has been shown to widen the
design space for chiral metamaterials [1]. While the benets of curved beams
are quite obvious, their employment in the structure makes the analytical
solution for the mechanical behavior of metamaterials much harder [11, 28].
Therefore, numerical methods, such as nite element analysis (FEA), are
widely used to nd corresponding mechanical constants. However, besides a
forward problem to obtain the properties for a specic geometry, from the
application point of view, the inverse question of searching for the geometry
that will provide the requested mechanical response is even more important.
Since multiple curves might generate unit cells with the same properties,
the inverse problem becomes ill-posed and requires more advanced solution
methods.
The recent development of generative models in machine learning (ML)
provides ideas on how to tackle this issue, with variational autoencoders
(VAEs) [18] and generative adversarial networks (GANs) [10] having shown
promising results for the generation of mechanical metamaterials [34, 35].
These models learn a transformation to a latent space, where each point cor-
responds to a valid design. When applied to metamaterials, the dimensions
of this space are usually connected to geometric features, which easily allows
to interpolate between dierent designs [35]. However, learning a mapping,
where some dimensions reect mechanical properties instead of geometric
features, is computationally expensive, and learning algorithms can be un-
stable. As an alternative, it has been shown that through the smart design of
neural networks and rational selection of the loss functions, it is possible to
3nd a suitable mapping between properties and structure without learning it
from a scratch [3, 21]. In this manuscript, we propose an approach that en-
ables us to eciently predict the mechanical response of reentrant-hexagonal
metamaterials based on curved Bezier beams and, more importantly, e-
ciently search for a wide variety of geometries that will suce the specic
requirements.
2. Unit cell design
2.1. Classical hexagonal and reentrant lattices
A honeycomb structure is a well-known two-dimensional cellular lattice
based on the six-sided hexagonal polygon unit cells with the identical strut
length and internal angles. Any change in the lengths and angles of the
honeycomb structure can lead to a new structure with dierent mechanical
properties. Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b illustrate the resultant classical hexagonal and
reentrant unit cells by altering the angle of inclined struts (BC) from positive
to negative values of , which yield a wide range of dierent structures with
positive and negative Poisson's ratios. The analytical solution for a hexago-
nal/reentrant structure with equal cross section of the beams, limited height
and limited width of the unit cell, has been derived previously by Hedayati et
al. [13]. In this section, a general solution for hexagonal/reentrant structures
that consist of various independent lengths and cross sections for beams is
derived. Due to the intrinsic geometrical symmetries of the hexagonal lat-
tice, the behavior of the corresponding unit cell can be described by four
individual degrees of the freedom (Fig. 1a).
By considering small deections and linear material behavior, the overall
deformation of the unit cell can be considered as the superposition of separate
deformations caused by applying individual loads at each degree of freedom.
Therefore, the superposition principle could be implemented for obtaining the
system of equations for the unit cell. The system of equilibrium equations
for the structure could be written as:

In this equation,fQgis the force vector which is composed of the external
forces acting on the unit cell, [ K] is the stiness matrix of the system and
fqgis the displacement vector corresponding to each degree of freedom. To
calculate the elements of the stiness matrix of the unit cell based on the
superposition method, unit displacements are applied individually to each
degree of freedom ( qi= 1;i= 1;2;3;4) by constraining all the other degrees
of freedom ( qj= 0;j6=i). Due to the symmetrical planes of the hexagonal
unit cells, there is no rotational degree of freedom at the joints, which means
that the struts of the unit cells are either under elongation (or contraction)
or bending (without rotation) at the joints. Therefore, the deformation of
an arbitrary strut within the unit cell can be illustrated as shown in Fig. 1c.
The general deformation at the free end of the beam, is decomposed into
an axial (u) and a lateral ( v) deformation, which yields the corresponding
reaction forces ( Fa,Ft) at the xed end of the beam. Based on the Euler-
Bernoulli beam theory, the axial and lateral stiness of the beam can be
derived asSi=AiE
liandTi=12EIi

5By solving the force equilibrium equations for each beam of the unit cell
according to the reaction forces resulting from individual degrees of freedom,
the stiness matrix of the unit cell is extracted as follows:

After deriving the stiness matrix of the unit cell, the system of equa-
tions (Eq. 2.1) can be solved for dierent loading conditions. To obtain the
mechanical properties of the hexagonal structure in xandydirections, the
corresponding loading conditions are applied to the unit cell and the system
of equations is solved to calculate the resultant deformations at the dened
degrees of freedom. The loading conditions of Q1= 1 andQ4= 1 yield the
dierent results for qithat are used for calculating the mechanical properties
of the structure such as Poisson's ratio. As a general denition, the equations
for Poisson's ratio of the hexagonal/reentrant unit cell in xandydirections
can be calculated by using xy= y
xandyx= x
yformulas. The strains
inxandydirections ( yandy) are calculated by using the results of q1and
q4for their corresponding loading conditions ( Q1= 1 orQ4= 1). Hence the
nal relationships for Poisson's ratios of the unit cell will be as follows:
yx= sin() (T2 S2) (2l2sin() + 2l1+l3)

The aforementioned results are used to calculate the Poisson's ratio of
hexagonal structures by using positive values of , or reentrant structures by
substitution of negative values of . The Poisson's ratio in the two directions
clearly depends on both the axial and lateral stiness of the horizontal and
inclined beams. Varying these stinesses by substituting the classical straight
beams with curved beams, a huge design variability can be achieved.

(ci;i= 1;::;6) and the knot vector k= (0;0;0;0:2;0:5;0:8;1;1;1)
2.2. Bezier curve theory
To replace straight beams with complex curved elements, a suitable rep-
resentation of these elements is needed. B-splines are able to provide smooth
parametric descriptions of such elements. By denition, these B-spline curves
B(t) are constructed from a combination of so-called control points and sev-
eral basis functions of order p[15]. One such B-spine and the corresponding
control points ci2Rdare shown in Fig. 2. Each point t2[0;1] along the
curve is given by a weighted sum of the control points, where the weights are
dened by the basis functions Ni;p: [0;1]![0;1] as
B(t) =nX
i=1Ni;p(t)ci (2.5)
This method assures that some parts of the curve are more dependent
on certain control points than others, which gets more evident when look-
ing at the way the basis functions themselves are constructed via recur-
sion. First, the curve is partitioned into smaller intervals, divided by knots
ki; i= 1;:::;n +p+ 1; kiki+1. Each zero-order basis ( p= 0) function is
dened as
7Ni;0(t) =(
1 ifki<t<ki+1
0 otherwise(2.6)
As one can see, the basis functions of order 0 are not smooth. The
recursive step then performs a smoothing operation on each base function
using one neighboring function, giving continuous curves
Ni;p(t) =t ki
ki+p kiNi;p 1(t) +ki+p+1 t
ki+p+1 ki+pNi+1;p 1(t) (2.7)
As can be seen, the number of control points contributing to each point
of the curve increases with the order. Fig. 2 shows a quadratic spline ( p= 2)
where this number is usually three. However, the start and end point of the
curve each depend only on a single control point. For this to occur, it is
necessary to have p+ 1 knots with ki=k0andki=kn+p+1respectively. In
this case Eq. 2.5 yields B(0) =c1andB(1) =cn. To generate the B-splines
for the unit cells we used the Python-package Splipy [16].
2.3. Generated metamaterials
The unit cells of the metamaterials considered here are inspired by hexag-
onal and reentrant honeycomb structures. As can be seen in Fig. 3 the hor-
izontal struts are connected by a curved quadratic B-spline or its mirrored
equivalent instead of straight beams. Due to the periodicity, there are several
ways to pick a unit cell for the same lattice; the unit cell shown in Fig. 3 is
just one of them. Like the one shown in Fig. 2, the B-spline connecting the
horizontal struts is given by six control points. As the unit cell is univocally
dened by the B-spline, these points can be further used to represent the
whole unit cell. For simplication, control points were placed equidistantly
along the x-axis, leaving only the coordinates along the y-axis as design vari-
ables. Additionally, the length of the horizontal struts ( ABin Fig. 3) was
kept the same for all unit cells, leaving them only dependent on the relative
position of the control points. The rst control point was always selected
as (0,0). Therefore, each structure is given by a set of ve independent pa-
rameters - the vertical values ci;yof the control points ci; i= 2;:::; 6 (see
Fig. 2). Using these parameters as design variables, two dierent datasets
were created:

Figure 3: A B-spline, the corresponding representative unit cell and a re-
sulting system comprised of 8 ×5 representative unit cells.
•Set 1 consists of unit cells based on B-splines with a xed end point,
resulting in unit cells corresponding to variations of a single reentrant
unit cell design with B0B= 0:5C0C. For this dataset, the horizontal
struts always have the same relative position, leaving the variation of
the B-splines as the only source of properties dierences.
•Set 2 consists of unit cells based on B-splines with free end points,
resulting in a greater diversity of unit cells. As can be seen in Fig.
4, varying the y-coordinate of the end of the unit cell can change its
underlying geometry from more reentrant like to hexagonal (see the
dashed red lines in Fig. 4b).
To obtain the Poisson's ratio for the structures in both datasets, sim-
ulations were performed in the nite element (FE) package COMSOL 5.4a
via the LiveLink interface. For these simulations, the B-splines were dis-
cretized into 150 beam elements. Periodicity was prescribed by matching
the displacements and angles on the boundaries of the unit cell. The Pois-
son's ratio was found as the ratio between lateral expansion vs applied tensile
strain ( "yy="xx). Note, that the considered metamaterials are not isotropic,
therefore the value of this Poisson's ratio is not bounded by 0.5 as in case
of isotropic materials. To verify the simulation approach, results for unit
cells with straight beams were compared to theoretical values of vxyderived
by Eq. 2.4. It was found that simulations match the theory well for small
deformations, as shown in Fig. 5.

dimensions of the unit cells from Set 1 are constant, cells from Set 2 can
resemble both reentrant or hexagonal structures.
3. ML implementation for forward (Structure-Property) problem
The Neural Network (NN) model Fdepicted in Fig. 6a was used to solve
the forward problem. This model predicts the Poisson's ratio of a structure
upon receiving the corresponding B-spline in form of its ve constitutive
parameters as input. The network consists of four fully connected layers,
including the output layer, where each hidden layer was followed by a ReLU
activation function. To learn how to predict the Poisson's ratio, the network
was trained using the Adam optimizer [17] and a Mean Squared Error objec-
tive function. Layer normalization [2] was used to reduce training time. For
both datasets the Poisson's ratios and the B-spline parameters were rescaled
to the range [0,1]. On each dataset a separate network with the same archi-
tecture was trained.
3.1. Set 1
Of the 25,000 examples in Set 1 , 90% were used for training, while the
remaining 10% were used as test set. Fig. 7a shows the comparison between
the Poisson's ratios obtained by the FEA and the forward model Ffor both
the train and test parts of Set 1 . Predictions of the network are very close to
simulation results and a good generalization can be observed with data from
train and test sets showing similar distributions ( R2= 0:99984).
3.2. Set 2
Set 2 consists of 25,000 data points, of which again 90% were used for
training and 10% for testing. Figure 7b shows the comparison between the
Poisson's ratio calculated through FEA and the value predicted by the net-
work. As for the optimal model, the predicted value should match the one

others were obtained through simulations in COMSOL with varying applied
strain (). Note, that simulations match the theory well, especially for small
strain.
from simulation, so ideally the plot would yield a line with unit slope. Similar
toSet 1 the model generalizes properly, with test set performance equivalent
to the training set ( R2= 0:99976).
The obtained models show an extremely good prediction of the mechanical
properties even with a relatively small number of samples. However, for both
datasets multiple unit cells can yield the same Poisson's ratio. This causes
the inverse problem to be ill-posed, as multiple solutions exist for a single
input.
4. ML implementation for inverse (Property-Structure) problem
Solving the inverse problem is far more challenging than its forward equiv-
alent, as it is not possible to simply reverse Fand train this network on
property/structure pairs. Instead it needs to be modied to address the fol-
lowing number of challenges, yielding the complex architecture consisting of

1)Measures used to minimize the distance between a generated and a
desired structure do not necessarily reect similar material properties. A
common approach to solve this is to utilize a pretrained surrogate model
F[21]. ViaFit is possible to backpropagate a property based loss to the
generator network G. CombiningFandGin this manner yields the system
shown in Fig. 8.
2)As mentioned in the previous section, multiple structures can have the
same properties, but a neural network can only produce one solution for a
given input. Therefore, to allow multiple solutions additional inputs have to
be added. This is often done in form of noise, where each component of the
noise has to be connected to the generated structure, or Gwill simply learn
to ignore it. This connection needs to be learned as well, which requires
a lot of additional eort (for example by training a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) [10]). Instead of adding noise and learning a connection,
here the additional input is given in form of a target B-spline that should be
resembled by the generated curve.
3)As neural networks are usually not able to make accurate predictions
outside of the range of their training data, it is necessary to limit generated
structures to a sensible range when tting the inverse model G. Here an
additional term was added to the loss function, that penalizes solutions which
dier from a straight line between start and endpoint.

In Eq. 4.1 the parameter controls the trade-o between matching the

training the inverse model G, both target properties and guide curve were
sampled from random uniform distributions. Note, that the guide curve is an

receives a target Poisson's ratio and guide curve. Based on these it generates

shown in Fig. 6b was trained separately on Set 1 and Set 2 , each time
combined with the respective forward model. For Set 1 the end points of
the guide curves as well as the ones of the generated B-splines were xed.
Similar to training the forward model, Adam was used as optimizer.
Fig. 9 shows the comparison between target and resulting mechanical
properties (Poisson's ratio) for randomly picked guide curves. The target
properties were chosen randomly, while the resulting Poisson's ratios of the
corresponding generated curves were obtained through FEA. A good tting
(R2= 0:99785 for Set 1 andR2= 0:99839 for Set 2 ) was obtained, although
Gwas not directly trained on FEA data, but Finstead. As expected, the
inverse model trained on Set 2 can design unit cells with a greater variety of
properties than the model trained on Set 1 .
SinceGhas two inputs (target Poisson's ratio and guide curve), we can
demonstrate the performance of the inverse network in two dierent ways.
Fig. 10a-b show the variety of curves generated for the same guide curve
with dierent target Poisson's ratio. It can be observed that a continuous
change in Poisson's ratio usually leads to quite smooth transformations in
the resulting curves. However, for some values of Poisson's ratio, one cannot
maintain the similarity with the guide curve. This is in part due to the
additional constraint on the "width" of the curve (see last term in Eq. 4.1)
Similarly Fig. 10c-d show the variety of the generated curves with the

same properties, but based on the dierent guide curves. It can be observed,
that the variety of the admissible generated curves with the same Poisson's
ratio is immense. Note, that the model trained on Set 2 shows a wider
variety of curves and Poisson's ratios as compared to the model trained on
Set 1 . This is expected behavior since geometrically Set 1 is the subset of
Set 2 , which includes unit cells based on hexagonal elements ( >0) besides
of reentrant ones.
5. Experiments
To validate the nite element simulation, mechanical tests were performed
on ten dierent geometries. While nine out of these ten specimens were based
on unit cells generated by the inverse model GforSet 1 , the tenth sample
was based on the corresponding reentrant unit cell with straight beams for
reference. These specimens (see Fig. 11a) consisted of 5x5 unit cells (25mm 
18:75mm5mm each) were additively manufactured from Ninjaex®TPU
lament by a Creality CR-10 3D-Printer. The tensile behavior of the samples
was tested on a Zwick&Roell 10kN universal testing machine. Since the
purpose of these tests was to verify how well the real specimens t the target

close to the simulations as possible, samples were subjected to a tensile load
with a ratio of 20 mm/min. The resulting Poisson's ratio was determined as
quotient of lateral and applied strain at 1% total strain. The measurements
necessary for this calculation were taken by analysing captured videos of the
experiments in the software Fiji [32].

The test results shown in Fig. 11b display a clear correlation between
target and exhibited behavior. This means that despite being only trained
on synthetic data, our model is able to make reliable predictions in a real
world setting.
6. Conclusion
In this work, we introduced a class of reentrant-hexagonal metamaterials
based on curved Bezier beams together with a deep learning framework to
generate unit cells with specic mechanical properties. Using Bezier curves
instead of straight beams allowed us to obtain a large variety of dierent
17properties, while keeping the dimensions of the corresponding unit cells con-
stant. At the same time, it yields a large number of possible unit cells to
t given properties. We used a guide curve instead of noise to create a one-
on-one mapping for this inverse problem. This approach enables us not only
to generate several unit cells with the same properties, but also to express
preference for a specic shape.
As the proposed forward neural network model can reliably predict me-
chanical properties of metamaterials ( R2>0:999), the corresponding inverse
model was able to accurately generate unit cells tting specic properties
(R2>0:997). Experiments showed that this ability extends to a real world
setting, even though both models being trained on simulations. Further-
more, both models are computationally ecient, allowing us to generate a
large number of unit cells in a short amount of time (around 20,000 unit cells
per second).
