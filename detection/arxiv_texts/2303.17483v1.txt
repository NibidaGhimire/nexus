1. Introduction
Continuous media are described mainly by nonlinear partial diﬀerential equa-
tions. The choice of linear or nonlinear equations for descr ibing a medium
depends on the role played by nonlinear eﬀects and is determi ned by the spe-
ciﬁc physical situation. For example, when describing the p ropagation of laser
pulses, it is necessary to take into account the dependence o f the refractive in-
dex of the medium on the electromagnetic ﬁeld intensity. The linearization of
nonlinear equations of mathematical physics does not alway s lead to meaning-
ful results. It may turn out that the linearized equations ap ply to the physical
process in question only for some ﬁnite time. Moreover, from the viewpoint
of physics, it is often “essentially nonlinear” solutions, qualitatively diﬀerent
from the solutions of linear equations, that are extremely i mportant for non-
linear equations of mathematical physics. These can be stat ionary solutions
of the soliton type, localized in one or several dimensions, or solutions of the
wave collapse type, which describe the spontaneous concent ration of energy in
small regions of space. Stationary solutions of hydrodynam ic equations are also
essentially nonlinear [1].
Nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations are diﬃcult to stu dy: almost no general
techniques exist that work for all such equations, and usual ly each individual
equation has to be studied as a separate problem. A fundament al question for
any partial diﬀerential equation is the existence and uniqu eness of a solution
for given boundary conditions. For nonlinear equations the se questions are in
general very hard [2].
This paper deals with the question of the absence and non-uni queness of global
and local classical solutions of the telegraph equation wit h a nonlinear potential.
12. Statement of the problem
In the domain Q= (0,∞)×(0,∞) of two independent variables ( t,x)∈(0,∞)×
(0,∞)⊂R2, consider the one-dimensional nonlinear equation.
/parenleftbig
∂2

x/parenrightbig
u(t,x)−f(t,x,u (t,x)) =F(t,x),(t,x)∈Q, (1)
wherea∈(0,∞),Fis a function given on the set Q, andfis a function given
on the setQ×R. Eq. (1) is equipped with the initial condition
u(0,x) =ϕ(x), ∂ tu(0,x) =ψ(x), x ∈[0,∞), (2)
and the boundary condition
B[u](t,0) =µ(t), t∈[0,∞). (3)
whereϕ,ψ, andµare functions given on the half-line [0 ,∞) andBis some
operator (it can have various forms, but in the present paper we assume that
B=IorB=∂x, whereIis the identity operator)
3. Nonexistence of solutions for inhomogeneous matching co nditions
Assertion 1. AssumeB=I. If the homogeneous matching conditions
µ(0) =ϕ(0), µ′(0) =ψ(0),
µ′′(0) =1
2/parenleftBig
f(0,0,ϕ(0)) +f(0,0,µ(0))/parenrightBig
+F(0,0) +a2ϕ(0)
fail for given functions f,ϕ,ψ,µ, andF, then the ﬁrst mixed problem (1) –
(3) does not have a classical solution deﬁned on Q.
Theproof follows from Theorem 1 from [3, 4].
Assertion 2. AssumeB=∂x. If the homogeneous matching conditions
µ(0) =ϕ′(0), µ′(0) =ψ′(0),
fail for given functions f,ϕ,ψ,µ, andF, then, for any smoothness of these
functions the second mixed problem (1) – (3) does not have a cl assical solution
deﬁned onQ.
Theproof can be carried out by the method of characteristics by analog y with
that of the preceding assertion.
4. Nonexistence of solutions for negative energy
In this section, we impose the following restrictions on the nonlinearity, the right
side of the equation, the initial data, and the boundary data of the problems.
Condition 1. The functions Fandµare identically equal to zero, the func-
tionfhas the form f(t,x,z ) =−g(z), whereg(0) = 0, and the smoothness
conditionsϕ∈C2
c([0,∞)),ψ∈C2
c([0,∞)),g∈C1(R) are satisﬁed.
2Under condition 1, we introduce the notation
G(z) =z/integraldisplay
0g(ξ)dξ, z ∈R,
and deﬁne the energy of a solution uof the problem (1) – (3)
E: [0,∞)∋t/mapsto→E(t) =

dx∈R.
Assertion 3. Assume that Condition 1 holds, for some constant the inequal ity

Suppose also that the energy is negative

dx< 0.
Then the problem (1) – (3) does not have a classical solution d eﬁned onQ.
The proof of the assertion can be carried out by the scheme set forth in [ 5,
Ch. 12].
5. Nonuniqueness of solutions for nonlinearity satisfying the Hölder
condition
In this section, we consider the second mixed problem (1) – (3 ) in the following
case
f(t,x,z ) :=zα,0<α< 1,
F(t,x) = 0, ϕ =ψ=µ≡0, B =∂x.(4)
It is easy to see that the mixed problem (1) – (4) has the trivia l solutionu≡0.
To ﬁnd non-trivial solutions of the problem (1) – (4) conside r the ansatz
u(t,x) =u(t) =βtγ,(t,x)∈Q. (5)
whereβandγare some real numbers. Substituting ansatz (5) into Eq. (1), we
obtain the relation
β(γ−1)γtγ−2=βαtαγ,
which leads to the system of equations
γ−2 =γα, β (γ−1)γ=βα,
3which has the solution
β= 21
α−1/parenleftbigg
α−3 +4
α+ 1/parenrightbigg1
1−α
, γ =2
1−α. (6)
Substituting (6) into (5), we get the function
up(t,x) = 21
α−1/parenleftbiggα+ 1
α2−2α+ 1/parenrightbigg1
α−1
t2
1−α. (7)
It is easy to see that the function (7) satisﬁes the initial (2 ) and boundary
conditions (3) of the problem (1) – (4). Thus, we have constru cted one nontriv-
ial solution of the problem (1) – (4), which is determined by t he formula (7).
Moreover, it can be easily shown that the ‘glued’ [6] solutio n
up;s(t,x) =/braceleftbigg
0, t ∈[0,s),
up(t−s,x), t∈[s,+∞),
with parameter s > 0 also satisﬁes the problem (1) – (4). Thus, we have
constructed the inﬁnite set of nontrivial classical soluti ons of the problem (1) –
(4).
We note that in the problem (1) – (4) the nonlinearity u/mapsto→ −uαis not diﬀer-
entiable function on the set R. It is the fact that makes the construction of a
unique local classical solution of the problem (1) – (4) impo ssible because, in
the case of continuously diﬀerentiable nonlinearity, we ca n build a local classi-
cal solution (but the matching conditions have to be satisﬁe d). We can do this
using the methods proposed in the works [3–5, 7, 8].
We can use this approach to prove the non-uniqueness of the cl assical solution
of other problems [9, 10].
6. Conclusions
In this paper, we have shown that the fulﬁllment of the smooth ness conditions
and the matching conditions is not enough for the existence o f a global classical
solution of boundary value problems for the telegraph equat ion with a nonlinear
potential, unlike the linear telegraph equation [11–17]. A lso, these conditions
do not lead to the uniqueness of solutions. For the existence and uniqueness
of a global classical solution, the nonlinearity of the equa tion has to satisfy
some additional conditions, e.g., the Lipschitz condition [3–5, 8, 18]. But on
the other hand, the Lipschitz condition is not necessary for the existence of a
unique global classical solution [19].
