It is generally considered that the signal output by a quantum circuit is attenuated exponentially fast in the
number of gates. This letter explores how algorithms using mid-circuit measurements and classical conditioning
ascomputational tools (and not as error mitigation or correction subroutines) can be naturally resilient to com-
plete decoherence, and maintain quantum states with useful properties even for infinitely deep noisy circuits.
Specifically, we introduce a quantum channel built out of mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward, that can
be used to compute dynamical correlations at infinite temperature and canonical ensemble expectation values
for any Hamiltonian. The unusual property of this algorithm is that in the presence of a depolarizing channel
it still displays a meaningful, non-zero signal in the large depth limit. We showcase the noise resilience of this
quantum channel on Quantinuum’s H1-1 ion-trap quantum computer.
Introduction. — The main obstacle to large-scale quantum
computing is the imperfect realization of quantum operations
[1, 2]. In the presence of noise, the signal output by a quantum
circuit is generically exponentially attenuated with the number
of gates [3–7], causing exponential overheads which threaten
the prospects of the utility of quantum computers. Quantum
error correcting codes are particular circuits fundamentally re-
lying on mid-circuit measurements and classical conditioning
on the measurement outcomes (also called feed-forward ) that
delay this complete depolarizing for very deep circuits [8–13].
However, these circuits only serve as subroutines within uni-
tary circuits and do not perform a computational task them-
selves. The purpose of this work is to investigate whether al-
gorithms that use mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward
directly as computational tools (rather than error correcting
subroutines) are naturally noise-resilient in the sense that in
the limit of an infinitely deep circuit there remains a non-zero
signal that contains information on the task fulfilled by the
algorithm.
In this Letter, we answer this question in the affirmative.
Specifically, we introduce a simple “shuffling” quantum chan-
nel based on mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward that
outputs a non-zero signal when repeated an arbitrary number
of times, even in the presence of noise. Crucially, this non-
zero signal also carries non-trivial, physically interesting in-
formation: We show that this quantum channel can be used to
compute finite temperature expectation values for any Hamil-
tonian H, as well as dynamical correlations at infinite temper-
ature tr [SeiHtSe−iHt]where Sis any Pauli string. We also
show that it can prepare certain density matrices in a noise-
resilient way as fixed points of a quantum channel.
The use of mid-circuit measurements to perform non-
unitary operations is well known, for example as a means of
post-selecting particular measurement outcomes [14–23], to
prepare specific, analytically tractable quantum states more
efficiently [24–29], or on top of another algorithm to miti-
gate the effect of noise [30–32]. Some algorithms use a weak
form of feed-forward where measurement outcomes are used
as a stopping criterion or to partially reset the state [33–38].
The novelty in the present approach is the use of mid-circuitmeasurement and feed-forward as computational primitives to
obtain non-trivial physical properties which, as we will show,
endows the computation with a natural noise-limiting prop-
erty. This noise-limiting behaviour is demonstrated analyti-
cally with specific noise models, numerically with noisy simu-
lations, and experimentally on Quantinuum ion-trap quantum
computers.
The shuffling quantum channel. — Let us start with in-
troducing the main quantum channel that we will study in
this Letter. The effect of the channel on expectation values
is given by Eq (2) below, and we will show that it can be used
to compute dynamical correlations at infinite temperature. As
we will explain, the surprising property of this channel is that
when repeated several times in the presence of noise, it still
outputs meaningful non-zero signal.
For a generic Hamiltonian HonLqubits, we define the
quantum channel Shuffle (H)by the three following steps.
1. Pick a Pauli matrix at each site, i.e. M1, ..., M L∈
{I, X, Y, Z }uniformly at random.
2. Prepare an ancilla in state |0⟩a. On the Lqubits and the
ancilla, apply eiHM1...MLXawhere we defined
HM1...ML=M1...M LHM L...M 1. (1)
3. Measure the ancilla. Only if the measurement outcome
is0, apply M1...M Lon the Lqubits.
Let us denote ρthe initial density matrix of the Lqubits, and
ρ′the new density matrix after running Shuffle (H). We are
going to show that for any Pauli string operator S=M′
1...M′
L
withM′
i∈ {I, X, Y, Z }, we have
tr [Sρ′] =Atr [Sρ] +B , (2)
with
A=tr [Ssin(H)Ssin(H)]
2L, B =tr [Scos2(H)]
2L.
(3)arXiv:2401.02207v1  [quant-ph]  4 Jan 20242
Moreover, the probability pof measuring 0in the ancilla is
p=tr [cos2(H)]
2L. (4)
Proof. — From step (1), we fix some Pauli matrices at
each site M1, ..., M L∈ {I, X, Y, Z }. We will denote MMM=
M1...M LandMthe set of all the 4LPauli strings. The oper-
atorU=eiHMMMXais diagonal in the eigenbasis of HMMM, with
matrix elements Unthat are operators on the ancilla and that
read
Un=cosEnisinEn
isinEncosEn
, (5)
withEnthe corresponding eigenvalue of HMMM. By prepar-
ing the ancilla in the state |0⟩, applying Uand measuring the
ancilla, we act on the Lqubits with the operator ⟨0|U|0⟩=
cos(HMMM)if we measure 0, and with ⟨1|U|0⟩=isin(HMMM)if
we measure 1. It follows that the density matrix ρ′
MMMthat we
obtain after the steps (2) and (3), assuming M1, ..., M Lhave
been picked at step (1), is
ρ′
MMM= sin( HMMM)ρsin(HMMM) +MMMcos(HMMM)ρcos(HMMM)MMM
= sin( HMMM)ρsin(HMMM) + cos( H)MMMρMMMcos(H).
(6)
Taking into account all the 4Lpossibilities of M1, ..., M Lat
step (1), the density matrix ρ′after one run of Shuffle (H)
is the sum of all the ρ′
MMM’s divided by 4L. We now note that on
the second term of ρ′
MMM, this sum precisely implements a com-
pletely depolarizing channel [13]. Namely, for any density
matrix ρwe have
1
4LX
MMM∈MMMMρMMM=1
2L. (7)
It follows
ρ′=1
4LX
MMM∈Msin(HMMM)ρsin(HMMM) +cos2(H)
2L. (8)
We note that the feed-forward in step (3) is crucial to obtain a
non-trivial density matrix. Had we always applied MMMon the
qubits independently of the measurement outcome of step (3),
the density matrix ρ′would have been the completely depo-
larized state 1/2L.
Let us now consider a given Pauli string operator M′M′M′∈ M ,
and denote the expectation values
m= tr [ M′M′M′ρ], m′= tr [ M′M′M′ρ′]. (9)
Multiplying (8) by M′M′M′and taking the trace, we make appear in
the sum the terms tr [M′M′M′sin(HMMM)ρsin(HMMM)]. Decomposing
ρin the basis of Pauli strings
ρ=X
M′′M′′M′′∈McM′′M′′M′′M′′M′′M′′, (10)we write
tr [M′M′M′sin(HMMM)ρsin(HMMM)]
=X
M′′M′′M′′∈McM′′M′′M′′tr [MMMM′M′M′MMMsin(H)MMMM′′M′′M′′MMMsin(H)].(11)
Let us perform first the sum over Mi∈ {I, X, Y, Z }appear-
ing in (8). We note that MiM′
iMiis either M′
i(ifMi=I, or
M′
i=I, orMi=M′
i), or−M′
i(in the remaining cases).
IfM′
i̸=M′′
i, then at least one of the two is not I, say
M′
i̸=I. IfM′′
i=I, then one sees that one gets an ampli-
tudetr [M′M′M′sin(H)M′′M′′M′′sin(H)]with a +sign when Mi=I
andMi=M′
i, and with a −sign in the two remaining
cases. Hence this term vanishes once summed over Mi. If
M′
i=IandM′′
i̸=I, the same reasoning applies. If both
M′
i, M′′
i̸=I, one sees that one gets a +sign when Mi=I
andMi̸=M′
i, M′′
i, and a −sign in the two remaining cases.
Hence this term also vanishes once summed over Mi. It fol-
lows that once we sum over all the Mi, only the terms where
M′
i=M′′
igive a non-zero contribution. This yields
X
MMM∈Mtr [MMMM′M′M′MMMsin(H)MMMM′′M′′M′′MMMsin(H)]
= 4Ltr [M′M′M′sin(H)M′′M′′M′′sin(H)]LY
i=1δM′
i,M′′
i.(12)
Noting that we have m=cM′M′M′2L, we obtain thus
m′=mtr [M′M′M′sin(H)M′M′M′sin(H)]
2L+tr [M′M′M′cos2(H)]
2L,
(13)
which is precisely (2). To compute the probability pof mea-
suring 0in the ancilla, we note that if M1, ..., M Lhas been
picked at step (1), then this probability pMMMis
pMMM= tr [ ρcos2(HMMM)]. (14)
Summing over M1, ..., M L, this yields
p=tr [cos2(H)]
4L×X
MMM∈Mtr [ρMMMcos2(H)
tr [cos2(H)]MMM]. (15)
Using in this equation the relation (7) for the density matrix
cos2(H)
tr [cos2(H)]we obtain (4) indeed.
Dynamical correlations at infinite temperature. — Let us
show how the shuffling quantum channel can be used to com-
pute dynamical correlations of Pauli strings S=M1...M Lat
infinite temperature, defined as
CS(t) =tr [e−iHtSeiHtS]
2L. (16)
These quantities are relevant for transport properties and have
attracted particular interest recently [39–49]. To compute this
quantity with the shuffling quantum channel, we write
CS(t) =tr [Scos(Ht)Scos(Ht)]
2L+tr [Ssin(Ht)Ssin(Ht)]
2L.
(17)3
Let us consider ρan arbitrary initial density matrix for which
we know tr [ρS]. We then apply on ρeither Shuffle (Ht)
with probability 1/2, orShuffle (Ht+π
2)with probability
1/2. We measure the Pauli string Sand denote tr [ρ′S]the
average outcome. Using formula (2), we have thus
tr [ρ′S] =A0+Aπ/2
2tr [ρS] +B0+Bπ/2
2, (18)
withAx, Bxthe coefficients (3) corresponding to the Hamil-
tonian Ht+x. From (3) we find thus for S̸=I
tr [ρ′S] =CS(t)tr [ρS]
2. (19)
Hence, one can directly compute the value of CS(t)provided
we chose ρsuch that tr [ρS]̸= 0. We note there are other
similar ways of extracting CS(t)from this quantum channel
[50].
This algorithm for dynamical correlations at infinite tem-
perature presents advantages compared to previously exist-
ing techniques. Computing the trace over the Hilbert space
through a purification requires to double the number of qubits,
whereas here there is only one ancilla qubit overhead. Im-
plementing the trace through a Haar random state preparation
[51] has a gate overhead to prepare the Haar random state,
and also a shot overhead because it computes the square of
the dynamical correlations and can only treat one site at a
time, which increases considerably the variance. Finally, for
Ssingle Pauli matrices, evaluating the trace as a sum over
product states in the basis of Scan have a large statistical
sampling overhead if dynamical correlations are small in this
basis, whereas our algorithm is basis-independent.
Mixed state preparation. — The density matrix constructed
previously in (19) contains information about the physics of
the system through CS(t), but also on the initial density ma-
trix through tr [ρS]. This can be problematic for strings S
involving different Pauli matrices at different sites, since the
preparation of ρsuch that tr [ρS]̸= 0 for multiple such S
would become non-trivial.
The shuffling quantum channel through the relation (2) ac-
tually enables one to prepare non-trivial density matrices in-
dependently of the initial density matrix. Let us repeat ntimes
the channel Shuffle (H)on an initial density matrix ρ0, de-
noting ρnthe resulting density matrix. Eq (2) yields a geo-
metric series for any string S
tr [Sρn] =Antr [Sρ0] +1−An
1−AB , (20)
withA, B given in (3). In particular, since |A|<1(except for
very specific choices of H, S where we would have |A|= 1)
when n→ ∞ we obtain
lim
n→∞tr [Sρn] =B
1−A, (21)
which does not depend on the initial density matrix. Moreover
the convergence is exponentially fast in nwith rate log 1/|A|.We thus prepare a non-trivial density matrix whose expec-
tation values contain physical information about the system
studied.
Noise-limiting behaviour: analytics. — We now argue that
the algorithms based on the repetition of the shuffling quan-
tum channel are to some extent resilient to noise. Let us con-
sider a noise model where a global depolarizing channel with
amplitude λis applied on the Lqubits every time we apply the
Shuffle (H)channel. This depolarizing channel transforms
a density matrix ρinto
ρ7→(1−λ)ρ+λ
2L. (22)
Hence, using (2), the (noisy) density matrix ρ′
noisy that de-
scribes the Lqubits after one round of Shuffle (H)and one
global depolarizing channel satisfies for S̸=I
tr [Sρ′
noisy] = (1 −λ)(Atr [Sρ] +B). (23)
Denoting ρnoisy ,nthe density matrix obtained after nnoisy
applications of Shuffle (H), the limiting value reached in
the limit of an infinite number of applications is
lim
n→∞tr [Sρnoisy ,n] =(1−λ)B
1−(1−λ)A, (24)
which is finite , even if an infinite number of gates and noise
channels have been applied. One notes that none of the L
qubits are ever measured or re-initialized. This shows the
noise resilience of the preparation of density matrices through
the shuffling quantum channel.
Let us explain why this noise-limiting behaviour is di-
rectly related to the use of mid-circuit measurements and feed-
forward. A circuit involving only unitary operations and mea-
surements without feed-forward can always be written as the
composition of density matrix maps T(ρ) =UρU†withU
unitary or T(ρ) =P
mPmρP†
mwithP
mPmP†
m= Id .
These maps both satisfy T(Id) = Id (also called “unital”
maps), so the completely mixed stateId
2Lis always a fixed
point of such circuits. However, with feed-forward these den-
sity matrix maps are in general T(ρ) =P
mUmPmρP†
mU†
m
withUmunitary, for which the identity is (generically) not
a fixed point. This prevents thus the completely depolarized
state to be reached in the limit of large number of gates.
This explanation yields the following nice interpretation of
the noise resilience of our algorithm. The resulting density
matrix after a large number of rounds converges to the fixed
point of the quantum channel. Because of the presence of mid-
circuit measurements and feed-forward, this fixed point can-
not be (in general) the completely depolarized channel. Now,
incorporating noise in the process (under any form) will only
smoothly change the quantum channel, and so only smoothly
change the fixed point, instead of sending it to the completely
depolarized state. The noise-resilience of the prepared density
matrix is thus built into the algorithm itself.
Noise-limiting behaviour: experiments and simula-
tions. — We now present numerical and experimental evi-
dence of the noise resilience of our algorithm. We consider4

would have a zero expectation value at either small or large
number of rounds. We report in Fig 1 the results of noiseless
simulations, noisy simulations with the H1 emulator, and
actual hardware implementation with the H1-1 machine ofQuantinuum for number of rounds n= 1 (185 two-qubit
gates and 782one-qubit gates) and n= 10 (1850 two-qubit
gates and 7820 one-qubit gates). It is known that noise on
quantum computers can be well accounted for, in a first
approximation, by attenuating the signal with a factor equal
to the product of the fidelities of the gates entering the circuit.
We evaluate the effect of the noise by measuring the signal
after one round n= 1 on the emulator with a large number
of shots, and comparing it to the exact value. From this, we
obtain an attenuation per round 1−λ. We plot then in Fig
1 the effect of the noise assuming it can be modelled by an
attenuation factor (1−λ)nat round ntimes the exact result,
which is labelled by “standard noise model”.
We observe that the results from the hardware agree very
well with the emulator data. In particular the measured value
atn= 10 is incompatible with the standard noise model by
around 3standard deviations. If we used the hardware data
atn= 1 to calibrate the standard noise model instead of the
emulator data, the incompatibility would be even larger.
Secondly, in Fig 2 we implement our algorithm for dy-
namical correlations at infinite temperature, comparing the
exact values, the noiseless simulations and the results of the
Quantinuum hardware emulator, without doing any noise mit-
igation. This emulator implements in particular a two-qubit
gate fidelity of around 0.998. We observe that the noisy val-
ues agree very well with the noiseless, despite the circuits con-
taining several hundreds of two-qubit gates, showing a noise-
resilience.
Canonical ensemble expectation values. — Finally, we
show that using a shuffling quantum channel with multiple
ancillas, one can compute expectation values at finite temper-
ature. Although this application is not of practical interest
(as we will show, it is exponential in system size runtime), it
shows the versatility of our channel in extracting physical in-
formation about a system. Let us consider a Hamiltonian H
onLqubits, an observable Oand an inverse temperature β.
We define
H′= arctan θ+βH−ϵZvO
2θN, (26)
on the system of Lqubits plus one “virtual” qubit v, where Zv
denotes the Pauli matrix Zapplied on the virtual qubit v, and
where we introduced parameters ϵ >0andθ >0, as well as
an integer N. As shown in the SM [50], the shuffling quantum
channel can be generalized into a channel Shuffle (H, N )
that uses Nancillas as follows: one applies step (2) to each
of the Nancillas, and then in step (3) one applies M1...M L
on the Lqubits only if alltheNancillas have been measured
to be in state 0. An identical relation to (2) follows then with
precise coefficients AandB[50]. In the particular case of H′
in (26), because Zvcommutes with H′, we have
tr [ρ′Zv] =Atr [ρZv] +B , (27)
with
A= 1−Tr [cos2N(H′)]
2L+1, B =Tr [Zvcos2N(H′)]
2L+1,(28)5
where Trdenotes the trace on the Lqubits and the virtual
ancilla v. Hence, by repeating this generalized channel we
obtain
lim
n→∞Tr [Zvρn] =Tr [Zvcos2N(H′)]
Tr [cos2N(H′)]. (29)
This prepares the virtual qubit in an ensemble that is close to
a canonical ensemble. Indeed, for Nlarger than the norm of
βH/θ , we have [52]
cos2N(H′)∼e−βH+ϵZvO
(1 +θ2)N. (30)
Hence, performing the trace over the virtual qubit vwe obtain
in this regime
lim
n→∞Tr [Zvρn] =ϵtr [Oe−βH]
tr [e−βH]+O(ϵ2,β||H||
Nθ), (31)
where we now use trto denote the trace over the Lqubits,
without the virtual qubit v. Interestingly, the algorithm au-
tomatically computes the ratio of traces tr [Oe−βH]/2Land
tr [e−βH]/2Lthat can each of them be exponentially small.
Using (28) and (30), the number of rounds nrequired to reach
this limit is 1/log(1−tr [e−βH]
2L(1+θ2)N). The time complexity
is thus exponential in the system size L, which is the ex-
pected scaling for a finite-temperature algorithm that applies
to generic Hamiltonians.
Discussion. — In this Letter we have provided a first exam-
ple of how non-error-corrected algorithms can avoid total de-
polarisation in the infinite-depth limit. This proof of principle
opens up a number of possible future directions. For example,
the algorithms presented here for finite temperature expecta-
tion values have an exponential time complexity, which is un-
avoidable without further assumption on H. It would be very
valuable to investigate whether these features can be improved
for local Hamiltonians H.

GENERALIZATION OF THE CHANNEL TO MULTIPLE ANCILLAS.
In this Section we generalize the shuffling quantum channel to multiple ancillas. Namely, for an integer Nwe define
Shuffle (H, N )through the following steps.
1. Pick a Pauli matrix at each site, i.e. M1, ..., M L∈ {I, X, Y, Z }uniformly at random.
2. Prepare Nancillas in state |0⟩a1...|0⟩aN. Forℓ= 1, ..., N , apply eiHM1...MLXaℓ.
3. Measure the Nancillas. Only if the measurement outcome is 0for all the Nancillas, apply M1...M Lon the Lqubits.
The analysis of Shuffle (H)is straightforwardly generalized to the case N > 1. For any Pauli string operator S=M′
1...M′
L
withM′
i∈ {I, X, Y, Z }, we have
tr [Sρ′] =Atr [Sρ] +B , (32)
with

p
tr [Scosp(H) sinN−p(H)
×Scosp(H) sinN−p(H)],(33)
and
B=tr [Scos2N(H)]
2L. (34)
Moreover, the probability pof measuring 0in all the Nancillas is
p=tr [cos2N(H)]
2L. (35)
When Scommutes with H, we obtain
A= 1−tr [cos2N(H)]
2L. (36)7
In the main text, the system on which we apply this quantum channel contains Lqubits and one extra ancilla v. It is thus a
system with L+ 1qubits. Moreover the Hamiltonian H′commutes with the particular choice of Pauli string S=Zvthat we
consider. This yields thus formula (28) in the main text.
ALTERNATIVE WAY OF EXTRACTING THE COEFFICIENTS AAND B.
In this Section we present an alternative way of computing coefficients AandBappearing in the shuffling quantum channel
output in Eq (2) of the main text. By applying twice Shuffle (H)on a density matrix ρ, and denoting ρ′′the output density
matrix, we have for any Pauli string S
tr [ρ′′S] =A2tr [ρS] +AB+B . (37)
It follows thus that we can extract Afrom the ratio
A=tr [ρ′′S]−tr [ρ′S]
tr [ρ′S]−tr [ρS], (38)
where we recall that ρ′denotes the density matrix after one single run of Shuffle (H). Then, Bis given by
B= tr [ ρ′S]−Atr [ρS]. (39)
Applying this process to the Hamiltonians HtandHt+π
2, one can then sum the resulting A’s and obtain the dynamical corre-
lation CS(t). This is the technique we used in Fig 2 of the main text to compute dynamical correlations at infinite temperature.
This way of computing CS(t)presents sometimes a lower variance compared to the one quoted in the main text, although
more involved. Let us indeed compute the variance ∆in the estimation of A. The variance in estimating tr [ρ′S]using Kshots
is1−tr [ρ′S]2
K. Hence, using Gaussian error propagation, at large Kthe variance ∆in estimating Athrough formula (38) is
∆ =1−tr [ρ′S]2
K1
(tr [ρS]−tr [ρ′S])2+1−tr [ρ′′S]2
K1
(tr [ρS]−tr [ρ′S])2
+1−tr [ρS]2
Ktr [ρ′S]−tr [ρ′′S]
(tr [ρS]−tr [ρ′S])22
+1−tr [ρ′S]2
Ktr [ρ′S]−tr [ρ′′S]
(tr [ρS]−tr [ρ′S])22
.(40)
Expressed in terms of m≡tr [ρS]andA, B , this is
∆ =1
K(m(A−1) +B)2
2 + 2 A2−(mA+B)2−(mA2+AB+B)2−m2A2−(mA+B)2A2
. (41)
Dynamical correlations typically become small as tincreases, meaning that Ais typically small, whereas Bremains of order 1
since the two B’s obtained from HtandHt+π
2have to add up to 1. When A→0andB→1, we see that we have ∆→0at
fixed K. When A→0forB= 1/2we have ∆ =2
3Kif we choose m=−1. For the method stated in the text, the variance in
estimating CS(t)is4
Kwhen CS(t)→0. This approach yields thus typically a lower variance in these situations.
