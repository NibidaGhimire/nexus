Drop impact experiments allow the modelling of a wide variet y of natural processes, from
raindrop impacts to planetary impact craters. In particula r, interpreting the consequences
of planetary impacts requires an accurate description of th e ﬂow associated with the
cratering process. In our experiments, we release a liquid d rop above a deep liquid pool
to investigate simultaneously the dynamics of the cavity an d the velocity ﬁeld produced
around the air–liquid interface. Using particle image velo cimetry, we analyse quantitatively
the velocity ﬁeld using a shifted Legendre polynomial decom position. We show that the
velocity ﬁeld is more complex than considered in previous mo dels, in relation to the non-
hemispherical shape of the crater. In particular, the veloc ity ﬁeld is dominated by degrees 0
and 1, with contributions from degree 2, and is independent o f the Froude and the Weber
numbers when these numbers are large enough. We then derive a semi-analytical model based
on the Legendre polynomial expansion of an unsteady Bernoul li equation coupled with a
kinematic boundary condition at the crater boundary. This m odel explains the experimental
observations and can predict the time evolution of both the v elocity ﬁeld and the shape of
the crater, including the initiation of the central jet.
1. Introduction
When a raindrop splashes on the surface of a pond, it takes les s than the blink of an
eye for a crater to form beneath the surface, throwing a ﬂuid c rown into the air, and for
it to collapse, propelling upwards a ﬂuid jet. These are the k ey features of the splashing
regime, which occurs within a speciﬁc range of drop radius, i mpact velocity, impact angle,
and physical properties of the ﬂuids such as surface tension , density and viscosity ( Rein
1993).Worthington (1908) was the ﬁrst to report these features using pioneering high -speed
photography methods. The splashing regime was then extensi vely investigated, regarding, in
particular, the time evolution of the transient crater foll owing the impact ( e.g.Engel 1967 ;
Morton et al. 2000;Bisighini et al. 2010), and the scaling of the maximum crater radius ( e.g.
Macklin & Metaxas 1976 ;Engel 1966 ;Lherm et al. 2022). The formation, evolution and
fragmentation of the ﬂuid crown ( e.g.Allen 1975 ;Krechetnikov & Homsy 2009 ;Zhang et al.

2010;Agbaglah et al. 2013) and of the central jet ( e.g.Fedorchenko & Wang 2004 ;Rayet al.
2015;van Rĳn et al. 2021) have also been examined.
The drop impact processes cover a wide variety of applicatio ns. This includes engineering
applications such as the water entry of projectiles ( Clanet et al. 2004) or spray painting
(Hines 1966 ). This also includes Earth sciences applications such as th e production of
oily marine aerosol by raindrops ( Murphy et al. 2015), spray generation from raindrop
impacts on seawater and soil ( Zhou et al. 2020), and planetary impact craters ( Melosh
1989;Landeau et al. 2021;Lherm et al. 2021,2022). Planetary impacts occur on terrestrial
planets from the early stages of accretion to modern meteori te impacts. During planetary
formation, thermal and chemical partitioning between the c ore and the mantle is inﬂuenced
by the physical mechanisms of segregation between the metal of the impactors’ core and
the silicates of the growing planet ( Stevenson 1990 ;Rubie et al. 2015;Lherm & Deguen
2018), with major implications on the chemical, thermal and magn etic evolution of the planet
(Fischer et al. 2015;Badro et al. 2018;Olson et al. 2022). In particular, the cratering process
is responsible for the initial dispersion and mixing of the i mpactors’ core ( Landeau et al.
2021;Lherm et al. 2022). In planetary science, impact craters are also a tool to sam ple the
shallow interior of planets and satellites by combining obs ervations of planetary surfaces
with excavation and ejecta deposition models ( Maxwell 1977 ;Barnhart & Nimmo 2011 ;
Kurosawa & Takada 2019 ). Therefore, understanding the implications of these plan etary
impacts requires to model the velocity ﬁeld produced during the formation of the crater.
In the splashing regime, the fate of the crater, the ﬂuid crow n and the central jet is directly
related to the velocity ﬁeld produced around the crater boun dary. The dynamics of the crater
is indeed closely related to the velocity ﬁeld in the ambient ﬂuid, in particular regarding
the evolution of the shape of the cavity. The formation of the ﬂuid crown is also related to
the ambient velocity ﬁeld through the mass ﬂux distribution across the initial water surface.
Finally, the production of the central jet is associated wit h a convergent velocity ﬁeld, resulting
from the collapse of the crater due in part to buoyancy forces .
The velocity ﬁeld associated with the crater evolution in th e splashing regime has been
investigated both experimentally and numerically in previ ous studies. Engel (1962) was the
ﬁrst to examine the velocity ﬁeld around the crater by seedin g the ﬂow with particles in order
to visualize the ﬂow streamlines. These observations allow ed to determine the velocity ﬁeld
conﬁguration associated with the crater expansion and its s ubsequent collapse. More recently,
the velocity ﬁeld was investigated using modern Particle Im age Velocimetry (PIV) methods.
These velocity ﬁeld measurements have been used to investig ate the origin of vortex rings
beneath the crater ( Liow & Cole 2009 ), the formation of the central jet ( van Rĳn et al. 2021),
or solutocapillary ﬂows following the impact of drops on sal ted water ( Musunuri et al. 2017).
Numerical simulations have also focused on the crater veloc ity ﬁeld, regarding in particular
the entrapment of air bubbles when the crater collapses and t he formation of the central jet
(Morton et al. 2000;Rayet al. 2015).
Most of the models involving a prediction of the crater veloc ity ﬁeld assume either an
arbitrary velocity ﬁeld ( Maxwell 1977 ) or an arbitrary velocity potential associated with
an imposed crater geometry, such as a hemispherical crater ( Engel 1967 ;Leng 2001 ) or a
spherical crater able to translate vertically ( Bisighini et al. 2010). Since these models have
only been compared with experimental measurements of the cr ater size and/or shape, a
comparison with experimental measurements of the velocity ﬁeld is thus required to assess
their accuracy. In any event, a new model is required to consi stently model the geometry of
the cavity without the use of an arbitrarily imposed velocit y ﬁeld or potential.
In this paper, we examine simultaneously the dynamics of the cavity and of the velocity
ﬁeld produced in drop impact experiments. In § 2, we present the experimental setup, methods
and diagnostics, as well as the set of dimensionless numbers used in this study. In § 3, we3

describe the experimental results obtained for the crater s hape and the velocity ﬁeld. In § 4,
we compare the existing velocity ﬁeld models with our experi mental measurements. In § 5,
we ﬁnally derive a Legendre polynomials model based on an uns teady Bernoulli equation
coupled with a kinematic boundary condition.
2. Experiments
2.1.Experimental setup
In these experiments, we release a liquid drop in the air abov e a deep liquid pool of the same
liquid (ﬁgure 1). We vary the impact velocity /u1D448/u1D456by changing the release height of the drop
while keeping the drop radius /u1D445/u1D456ﬁxed. We also keep constant the density /u1D70C, the viscosity /u1D707
and the surface tension /u1D70Eof the ﬂuids.
The liquid pool is contained in a 16 ×16×30 cm glass tank. The pool level is set at the top
of the tank to minimise the thickness of the meniscus on the si des of the tank. This allows
to image a ﬁeld of view unperturbed by the free surface menisc us eﬀect. We generate the
drops using a needle supplied with ﬂuid by a syringe driver. W hen the weight of the drop
exceeds the surface tension forces, the drop comes oﬀ. We use a nylon plastic needle with
an inner diameter of 4.7 mm, generating drops with a radius /u1D445/u1D456=2.7 mm. We measured the
drop size based on a calibration using mass measurements of d ozens of drops and assuming
the drop is spherical. We validate this method using high-sp eed pictures of the drop prior
to impact where we can directly measure the drop radius. We ob tain a relative diﬀerence
of 1.4% between mass measurements and direct measurements. Impact velocities are in
the range /u1D448/u1D456=1−5 m.s−1. We calculate the impact velocity for each experiment using a
calibrated free-fall model for the drop, including a quadra tic drag. We validate this method
using high-speed pictures of the drop prior to impact where w e can directly measure the4

drop velocity. We obtain a relative diﬀerence of 0.6% betwee n the velocity model and direct
measurements. We use water both in the drop and in the pool, in a temperature-controlled
environment. The density is /u1D70C=998±1 kg.m−3. It was measured using an Anton Paar DMA
35 Basic densitometer. The viscosity is /u1D707=1±0.01 mPa.s (Haynes 2016 ). The surface
tension at the air-water interface is /u1D70E=72.8±0.4 mJ.m−2(Haynes 2016 ).
In our experiments, we position the camera at the same height as the water surface. We
record images at 1400 Hz with a 2560 ×1600 pixels resolution (21 /u1D707m/px) and a 12 bits
dynamic range, using a high-speed Phantom VEO 640L camera an d a Tokina AT-X M100
PRO D Macro lens.
2.2.Dimensionless numbers
In these experiments, the impact dynamics depends on /u1D448/u1D456,/u1D445/u1D456,/u1D70C,/u1D707,/u1D70E, and the acceleration
of gravity /u1D454. Since these six parameters contain three fundamental unit s, the Vaschy-
Buckingham theorem dictates that the impact dynamics depen ds on a set of three independent
dimensionless numbers. We choose the following set:
/u1D439/u1D45F=/u1D4482
/u1D456
/u1D454/u1D445/u1D456, /u1D44A/u1D452=/u1D70C/u1D4482
/u1D456/u1D445/u1D456
/u1D70E, /u1D445/u1D452=/u1D70C/u1D448/u1D456/u1D445/u1D456
/u1D707. (2.1)
The Froude number /u1D439/u1D45Fis a measure of the relative importance of impactor inertia a nd gravity
forces. It can also be interpreted as the ratio of the kinetic energy/u1D70C/u1D4453
/u1D456/u1D4482
/u1D456of the impactor to its
gravitational potential energy /u1D70C/u1D454/u1D4454
/u1D456just before impact. The Weber number /u1D44A/u1D452compares the
impactor inertia and interfacial tension at the air-liquid interface. The Reynolds number /u1D445/u1D452
is the ratio between inertial and viscous forces. In the foll owing, time, lengths and velocities
are made dimensionless using the drop radius and the impact v elocity, i.e.using respectively
/u1D445/u1D456//u1D448/u1D456,/u1D445/u1D456,/u1D448/u1D456. These dimensionless quantities are denoted with a tilde. F or example, we use
a dimensionless time ˜/u1D461=/u1D461/(/u1D445/u1D456//u1D448/u1D456).
We focus on four cases with Froude numbers, Weber numbers and Reynolds numbers
respectively in the range /u1D439/u1D45F≃100−1000,/u1D44A/u1D452≃100−1000 and /u1D445/u1D452≃4400−13600
(table 1). For each case, we conducted three acquisitions, with simi lar experimental results
regarding both the crater shape ( e.g.ﬁgure 4) and the velocity ﬁeld ( e.g.ﬁgure 11). This
validates the repeatability of the experiments.
2.3.Particle Image Velocimetry
The velocity ﬁeld is obtained using PIV. We seed the tank with polyamide particles (ﬁgure
1), the concentration, diameter and density of which being re spectively /u1D436/u1D45D=0.26 g.L−1,
/u1D451/u1D45D=20/u1D707m and/u1D70C/u1D45D=1030 kg.m−3. We illuminate these particles in suspension with a
1 mm thick laser sheet (532 nm), produced using a continuous 1 0 W Nd:YAG laser, together
with a diverging cylindrical lens and a telescope. The laser sheet is verticalised using a 45◦
inclined mirror located below the tank. The laser wavelengt h is isolated using a band-pass
ﬁlter (532 ±10 nm).

from the shifted Legendre polynomials decomposition (equa tion2.2), for degrees /u1D458=0
(blue),/u1D458=1 (orange) and /u1D458=2 (green). The deﬁnitions of the Cartesian (/u1D465,/u1D466,/u1D467)(black)
and of the spherical (/u1D45F,/u1D703,/u1D711)(red) coordinate systems are also represented.
In order to calculate the velocity ﬁeld, the camera records t wo images of the ﬁeld
of view separated by a short time ( Δ/u1D461=200/u1D707s). These two images are divided into
interrogation windows in which a cross-correlation operat ion allows to obtain the average
particle displacement. This involves a ﬁve-stage multi-pa ss processing with interrogation
windows decreasing in size. The ﬁnal interrogation window s ize is a 64 px square with
an overlap of 75%. In each window, a velocity vector is then ca lculated, which allows to
construct the velocity ﬁeld over the whole ﬁeld of view. Fina lly, the velocity ﬁeld is spatially
calibrated using a sight.
2.4.Experimental diagnostic
2.4.1. Crater shape
The crater shape is directly obtained from the raw images use d in the PIV procedure (ﬁgure
2). The crater corresponds to a particle-free area, together with a high light intensity area,
explained by reﬂections at the air-water interface, in part icular at the bottom of the crater.
The crater boundary is deﬁned using these image properties, which allow to delineate the
cavity using background removal, an intensity threshold me thod and image binarisation.
We ﬁt the crater boundary position /u1D445(ﬁgure 2), which depends on the polar angle /u1D703and
time/u1D461, using a set of shifted Legendre polynomials ¯/u1D443/u1D458up to degree /u1D458/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465=2

mials are an aﬃne transformation of the standard Legendre po lynomials ¯/u1D443/u1D458(/u1D465)=/u1D443/u1D458(2/u1D465−1),
and are orthogonal on [0,1],i.e.on a half-space. The coeﬃcients /u1D445/u1D458(/u1D461)correspond to
increasingly small scale deviations from a hemispherical s hape./u1D4450(/u1D461)corresponds to the
mean crater radius (ﬁgure 2, blue line). /u1D4451(/u1D461)corresponds to a deformation of the crater, linear6

The circles and the solid lines correspond to the crater shap e obtained respectively from

in cos/u1D703, with respect to an hemisphere (ﬁgure 2, orange line). When /u1D4451(/u1D461)>0, the crater
is stretched vertically, resulting in a prolate cavity. Whe n/u1D4451(/u1D461)<0, the crater is stretched
horizontally, resulting in an oblate cavity. Finally, /u1D4452(/u1D461)corresponds to a deformation of the
crater, quadratic in cos /u1D703, with respect to a hemisphere (ﬁgure 2, green line).
In order to validate the crater shape determination procedu re, we compare the coeﬃcients
/u1D445/u1D458(/u1D461)obtained from the raw images used in the PIV procedure ( e.g.ﬁgure 2), with the
coeﬃcients obtained from an experiment in the same conditio n, but illuminated from behind
(e.g.ﬁgure 13). This backlight experiment (see Lherm et al. (2022) for experimental details)
allows to determine reliably the shape of the crater. Figure 3shows that the coeﬃcients
are very similar between the two methods, which validates th e crater shape determination
procedure from PIV raw images.
2.4.2. Velocity ﬁeld
We aim to compare the experimental velocity ﬁeld obtained us ing the PIV procedure with
velocity models. For that purpose, the velocity ﬁeld /u1D496=(/u1D462/u1D45F,/u1D462/u1D703,/u1D462/u1D711)is expressed in a
spherical coordinate system ( /u1D45F,/u1D703,/u1D711 ) deﬁned such that /u1D462/u1D45Fand/u1D462/u1D703are in the plane of the laser
sheet (ﬁgure 2, red coordinates). The origin of this coordinate system is t he contact point
between the impacting drop and the target liquid (ﬁgure 2, point O).
We decompose the components of the velocity ﬁeld on a shifted Legendre polynomials
basis
/u1D462/u1D45F(/u1D45F,/u1D703,/u1D461)=+∞/summationdisplay.1
/u1D459=0/u1D462/u1D45F,/u1D459(/u1D45F,/u1D461)¯/u1D443/u1D459(cos/u1D703), (2.3)

where/u1D462/u1D45F,/u1D459(/u1D45F,/u1D461)and/u1D462/u1D703,/u1D459(/u1D45F,/u1D461)are respectively the decomposition coeﬃcients of /u1D462/u1D45Fand/u1D462/u1D703.
The shifted Legendre polynomials ¯/u1D443/u1D459(cos/u1D703)being orthogonal on half-hemispheres ( /u1D703∈
[0,/u1D70B/2]), we obtain the /u1D462/u1D45F,/u1D459(/u1D45F,/u1D461)and/u1D462/u1D703,/u1D459(/u1D45F,/u1D461)coeﬃcients using a least-square inversion of
the experimental velocity components over the separate hal f-hemispheres /u1D703/greaterorequalslant0 and/u1D703 <0,
before averaging the results from the left and right half-he mispheres. Since the ﬂow is close
to axisymmetric ( e.g.ﬁgure 2), the coeﬃcients obtained by the inversion over each half-
hemisphere are very close to each other. Assuming an axisymm etric ﬂow, note that /u1D462/u1D45F,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)
is the average of /u1D462/u1D45Fover the full hemisphere.7

case, the diﬀerent types of markers correspond to diﬀerent e xperiments.

3.1.Crater shape
Figure 4shows the ﬁtted coeﬃcients of the shifted Legendre decompos ition of the crater
boundary (equation 2.2) as a function of time, for all experimental cases. We normal ise
the ﬁtted coeﬃcients /u1D4451(/u1D461)and/u1D4452(/u1D461)by/u1D4450(/u1D461),i.e.the mean crater radius. Using this
normalisation, we quantify the deviation of the crater geom etry from a hemisphere. We also
normalise time by the opening timescale of the crater ( Lherm et al. 2022)

where the sum of the potential energy of the crater and of the k inetic energy of the crater,

reaches its maximum size ( Lherm et al. 2022), the maximum crater radius scales as

Using this /u1D439/u1D45F1/4scaling law, the energy conservation equation is integrate d between ˜/u1D461=0
and˜/u1D461=˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465to obtain the opening timescale of the crater given by equati on3.1. More details
can be found in Lherm et al. (2022). With our experimental range of Froude number, we use
Φ =/u1D439/u1D45F−0.156and/u1D709=0.34 (Lherm et al. 2022). This normalisation allows to collapse our
experiments on the same timescale.
In ﬁgure 4, the crater shape evolution of case A is markedly diﬀerent fr om cases B, C and
D. Thus, we describe this case separately. We ﬁrst deal with t he high/u1D44A/u1D452experiments (cases
B, C and D), where surface tension eﬀects are negligible in co mparison with the impactor
inertia ( e.g.Pumphrey & Elmore 1990 ;Morton et al. 2000;Leng 2001 ;Rayet al. 2015).
The crater size increases with the Froude number (ﬁgure 4, inset), in a way that is compatible
with a/u1D439/u1D45F1/4scaling law for the maximum mean crater radius /u1D4450/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465(Engel 1966 ;Leng
2001;Lherm et al. 2022). Furthermore, the evolution of the crater shape relative t o the mean
crater size is independent of the Froude number, with simila r evolution of /u1D4451(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461)and
/u1D4452(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461)(ﬁgure 4b-c).8
At early times of the crater opening stage ( ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/lessorsimilar0.25), the mean radius of the crater
/u1D4450(/u1D461)increases (ﬁgure 4a) as the cavity opens. The crater has a ﬂat-bottomed oblate s hape
(e.g.ﬁgure 5, i) as a result of the spread of the drop on the surface of the po ol, with negative
/u1D4451(/u1D461)(ﬁgure 4b). The ﬂat-bottomed oblate cavity gradually becomes hemis pherical as a
result of the overpressure produced at the contact point bet ween the impacting drop and the
surface ( e.g.ﬁgure 5, ii). The magnitude of /u1D4451(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461)indeed decreases with time during
this stage (ﬁgure 4b). The crater is also deformed at higher degrees with mostly negative
/u1D4452(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461)(ﬁgure 4c). This corresponds to second-order deviations from the he mispherical
shape, with a ﬂattened crater boundary close to the surface ( e.g.ﬁgure 5, i).
At intermediate times of the crater opening stage (0 .25/lessorsimilar˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/lessorsimilar0.5), the crater
continues to open (ﬁgure 4a). The cavity is still stretched vertically, which leads to
increasingly positive /u1D4451(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461)(ﬁgure 4b),i.e.a prolate cavity (ﬁgure 5, iii). The crater
reaches a maximum prolate deformation when ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465≃0.5, with/u1D4451(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461) ≃0.08 (ﬁgure
4b). The crater is also deformed at higher degrees, with posit ive/u1D4452(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461)(ﬁgure 4c).
This corresponds to a vertical crater boundary close to the s urface (ﬁgure 5, iii).
At late times of the crater opening phase (0 .5/lessorsimilar˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/lessorsimilar1), the mean crater radius
still increases (ﬁgure 4a) but the crater starts to ﬂatten with decreasing /u1D4451(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461)(ﬁgure
4b). As the opening velocity of the crater decreases, buoyanc y forces become signiﬁcant,
resulting in the horizontal stretching of the cavity. The cr ater ﬂattens to give an approximately
hemispherical crater at ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465≃1 (ﬁgure 5, v).
After the crater has reached its maximum size ( ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/greaterorsimilar1), the mean crater radius starts
to decrease (ﬁgure 4a)./u1D4451(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461)decreases at a rate higher than in the opening stage of
the crater (ﬁgure 4b). Horizontal stretching of the crater is accelerated, as e xpected since
buoyancy forces are now prevailing. This leads to the format ion of an increasingly oblate
cavity (ﬁgure 5, vi-vii). When ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/greaterorsimilar1.5, higher degrees eventually deviate from zero
with positive /u1D4452(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461)(ﬁgure 4c). In addition to the negative value of /u1D4451(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461), this
corresponds to the formation of the central jet (ﬁgure 5, viii-ix).
We now deal with the moderate /u1D44A/u1D452experiment (case A), where surface tension eﬀects
are signiﬁcant in comparison with the impactor inertia ( e.g.Pumphrey & Elmore 1990 ;
Morton et al. 2000;Leng 2001 ;Rayet al. 2015). In this case, a downward propagating
capillary wave developsat the cavity interface and drives t he crater deformation, often leading
to the entrapment of a bubble due to the pinching of the cavity (e.g.Oguz & Prosperetti 1990 ;
Pumphrey & Elmore 1990 ;Prosperetti & Oguz 1993 ;Elmore et al. 2001). This mechanism
is typically expected at moderate /u1D44A/u1D452,i.e./u1D44A/u1D452≃30−140 (ﬁgure 6 in Pumphrey & Elmore
1990). During crater opening, this explains why the maximum prol ate deformation occurs
later than in the other cases, at ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465≃0.8, and why the prolate deformation is larger,
with/u1D4451(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461) ≃0.2 (ﬁgure 4b). During crater closing, the evolution of /u1D4451(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461)and
/u1D4452(/u1D461)//u1D4450(/u1D461)is markedly diﬀerent from the other cases due to the converge nce of the capillary
wave at the bottom of the crater.
3.2.Velocity ﬁeld
3.2.1. Velocity maps
Figure 5shows the evolution of the norm of the velocity |/u1D496|=(/u1D4622
/u1D465+/u1D4622
/u1D467)1/2as a function
of time, for case B. During the opening stage of the crater, th e velocity around the crater
gradually decreases due to the deceleration of the crater bo undary (ﬁgure 5, i-iv). The
maximum velocity is ≃1.1 m.s−1at time 1.3 ms after contact (ﬁgure 5, i), which corresponds
to 32% of the impact velocity. When ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/greaterorsimilar0.1, the norm of the velocity decreases radially
around the crater (ﬁgure 5, ii-iv), whereas, when ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/lessorsimilar0.1, the velocity decreases at a
higher rate on the side of the crater. This may be explained by the initial oblate shape of9

Legendre polynomial decomposition (equation 2.2).
the crater, related to the spread of the drop on the water surf ace upon impact, which leads
to a higher velocity beneath the crater as it becomes gradual ly hemispherical. The velocity
ﬁeld is composed of a dominant radial component and of a polar component responsible for
an upward ﬂow across the initial water surface (ﬁgure 5, i-iv). The polar component is thus
responsible for the formation of the liquid crown above the w ater surface ( e.g.Rein 1993 ;
Fedorchenko & Wang 2004 ;Zhang et al. 2010).
When the crater reaches its maximum size (ﬁgure 5, v), the cavity is nearly hemispherical
and the velocity ﬁeld seems to vanish simultaneously in the e ntire ﬂow, consistently with
Engel (1966)’s observations, which were subsequently used in several v elocity models
(e.g.Engel 1967 ;Prosperetti & Oguz 1993 ). However, this ﬁrst-order assumption on the
simultaneous vanishing velocity ﬁeld does not hold when the ﬂow is examined in detail.
Beneath the cavity, the velocity gradually decreases and ev entually vanishes just before the
crater reaches its maximum size. The velocity is directed do wnwards due to the expansion of
the crater. The velocity then increases again but is directe d upwards due to the collapse of the
crater. On the side of the cavity, close to the surface, the ve locity does not vanish when the
crater reaches its maximum size. The collapse of the crater t akes over its initial expansion,
which allows to keep outward velocities on the side of the cra ter.
When the crater collapses (ﬁgure 5, vi-ix), a convergent ﬂow forms towards the centre of
the cavity. This leads to the formation of the central jet.
Figure 6shows the evolution of the vorticity /u1D714/u1D466=/u1D715/u1D462/u1D465//u1D715/u1D467−/u1D715/u1D462/u1D467//u1D715/u1D465as a function of time,
for case B. The vorticity produced by the impact around the cr ater is conﬁned close to the
air-water boundary, in particular when the crater is strong ly deformed, at the beginning of10

the crater opening (ﬁgure 6, i-ii) and when it collapses (ﬁgure 6, vi-ix). This suggests that the
ﬂow is mostly irrotational, which supports the potential ﬂo w assumption used in previous
models (§ 4). Furthermore, some of the vorticity observed around the cr ater boundary may
be an artefact related to spurious velocity measurements pr oduced by cross-correlations on
reﬂections at the air-water interface, and not on PIV partic les. This assumption is supported
by the estimated diﬀusion length of the vorticity (0.3 mm in 1 00 ms) which is signiﬁcantly
smaller than the typical size of the vorticity band.
3.2.2. Velocity coeﬃcients
Figure 7shows the coeﬃcients /u1D462/u1D45F,/u1D459(/u1D45F,/u1D461)and/u1D462/u1D703,/u1D459(/u1D45F,/u1D461)(equations 2.3-2.4) as a function of
the radial coordinate at a given time ˜/u1D461=15.4 (˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465=0.43) during the crater opening
stage of case B. During this stage, the velocity ﬁeld is domin ated by the degrees /u1D459=0 and
/u1D459=1, the higher degrees /u1D459/greaterorequalslant2 being much smaller. When /u1D45F/lessorsimilar1.2/u1D4450, we observe a decrease
in the slope of the coeﬃcients. This may be related to the devi ation of the crater from a
hemisphere. The coeﬃcients indeed sample points located at varying distances from the
actual crater boundary, including artefacts located into t he crater, which may inﬂuence the
radial dependency of these coeﬃcients close to the crater bo undary. In ﬁgure 7, we identify
this misleading trend by using dashed lines when the radius i s smaller than max {/u1D445(/u1D703)}
(/u1D45F/lessorequalslant1.11/u1D4450in ﬁgure 7).
Figures 8and9compare the time evolution of the coeﬃcients /u1D462/u1D45F,/u1D459(/u1D45F,/u1D461)and/u1D462/u1D703,/u1D459(/u1D45F,/u1D461)
(equations 2.3-2.4) between the cases, for /u1D459/lessorequalslant2. Except for the diﬀerent normalisation, ﬁgure

velocity artefacts are located in the crater. The coeﬃcient s are calculated at ˜/u1D461=15.4

for the crater shape, the moderate /u1D44A/u1D452case A is diﬀerent from the high /u1D44A/u1D452cases B, C and
D, both for the radial (ﬁgure 8) and the polar (ﬁgure 9) component of the velocity ﬁeld. We
thus deal with this case separately.
We ﬁrst deal with the high /u1D44A/u1D452experiments (cases B, C and D), where both components of
the velocity ﬁeld are similar among cases, regardless of the degree in question. The velocity
ﬁeld is mostly dominated by the degrees /u1D459=0 and/u1D459=1, both during the opening and the
closing stage of the crater, in agreement with ﬁgure 7.
During the crater opening stage ( ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/lessorsimilar1), the dominant degrees of the radial component
/u1D462/u1D45F,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)and/u1D462/u1D45F,1(/u1D45F,/u1D461)are positive (ﬁgure 8). This corresponds to the strong radial velocity
ﬁeld related to the expansion of the cavity. The dominant deg rees of the polar component
/u1D462/u1D703,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)and/u1D462/u1D703,1(/u1D45F,/u1D461)are concomitantly positive and negative, respectively (ﬁg ure9), with
a lower magnitude. This corresponds to a polar perturbation of the dominant radial velocity
ﬁeld, related to the mass ﬂux across the surface /u1D467=0 which produces the ﬂuid crown. The
positive coeﬃcient /u1D462/u1D703,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)indeed corresponds to a ﬂow toward the surface, while the
negative coeﬃcient /u1D462/u1D703,1(/u1D45F,/u1D461)corresponds to a degree /u1D459=1 perturbation, linear in cos /u1D703. The
degree/u1D459=2 also contributes to the velocity ﬁeld of both components, i n particular when
the crater is strongly deformed due to the spread of the drop a t the surface of the pool, at the
beginning of the opening stage ( ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/lessorsimilar0.25).
When the crater reaches its maximum size ( ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465≃1), the dominant degrees of both
components change signs as the crater starts to collapse. In detail,/u1D462/u1D45F,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)vanishes later
(˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465≃1) than/u1D462/u1D45F,1(/u1D45F,/u1D461)(˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465≃0.6) (ﬁgure 8) and/u1D462/u1D703,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)(˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465≃0.8) (ﬁgure
9). This is in agreement with the observations of ﬁgure 5at˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465≃1, where the velocity
vanishes beneath the crater but not on the sides.
During the crater closing stage ( ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/greaterorsimilar1),/u1D462/u1D45F,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)and/u1D462/u1D45F,1(/u1D45F,/u1D461)are both negative
(ﬁgure 8) and/u1D462/u1D703,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)is negative (ﬁgure 9). This corresponds to the development of the
convergent ﬂow related to the collapse of the crater and the f ormation of the central jet.
As at the beginning of the opening stage, the degree /u1D459=2 of both components contributes
signiﬁcantly to the velocity ﬁeld at the end of the closing st age (˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/greaterorsimilar1.5), in relation
with the strongly deformed crater boundary.12

/u1D445/u1D456, for case B. Time is normalised by the opening timescale of th e crater ˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465.
We now deal with the moderate /u1D44A/u1D452experiment (case A). Although the degree /u1D459=0
of both components is similar to the high /u1D44A/u1D452cases, the degrees /u1D459=1 and/u1D459=2 of case
A are signiﬁcantly larger than their counterparts of cases B , C and D. Furthermore, the
time at which /u1D462/u1D45F,1(/u1D45F,/u1D461)and/u1D462/u1D703,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)vanish is signiﬁcantly modiﬁed. This may also be a
consequence of signiﬁcant surface tension eﬀects in this mo derate/u1D44A/u1D452experiment, related to
vigorous deformations of the crater boundary by the propaga tion of a capillary wave towards
the bottom of the crater.
4. Comparison with existing velocity models
In this section, we review the velocity models proposed by Engel (1967),Maxwell (1977),
Leng (2001) and Bisighini et al. (2010), and compare their predictions with our observations.
Since most of these models have been designed to understand t he crater opening stage, we
compare these models with our experimental velocity measur ements by focusing on a typical
snapshot of this initial stage. For that purpose, ﬁgure 10shows the dominant coeﬃcients
/u1D462/u1D45F,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461),/u1D462/u1D45F,1(/u1D45F,/u1D461),/u1D462/u1D703,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)and/u1D462/u1D703,1(/u1D45F,/u1D461)of case B as a function of the radial coordinate
at˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465=0.24, as well as the predictions of the models.13

4.1.Engel (1967)’s model
Engel (1967)’s model assumes an energy balance where the potential ener gy of the crater,
the potential energy of a cylindrical wave developing above the surface, the surface tension
energy of the produced interface, the kinetic energy of the ﬂ ow around the crater, the kinetic
energy of the cylindrical wave and viscous dissipation are e qual at any time to half of
the kinetic energy of the impacting drop. Among the assumpti ons of such a model, Engel
(1967) assumes a hemispherical crater with a radius /u1D4450(/u1D461)and a potential ﬂow with a
velocity potential /u1D719satisfying the boundary conditions on the velocity |/u1D496|(/u1D45F=+∞)=0 and
|/u1D496|[/u1D45F=/u1D4450(/u1D461)]=∝dotacc/u1D4450(/u1D461). The velocity potential used in the model is

/u1D45F. (4.1)

normalised by the mean crater velocity ∝dotacc/u1D4450(/u1D461), as a function of the radial coordinate /u1D45F,
normalised by the mean crater radius /u1D4450(/u1D461). The circles correspond to case B at
˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465=0.24. The dash-dotted lines correspond to the models of Engel (1967),Maxwell
(1977),Leng (2001) and Bisighini et al. (2010). The solid line corresponds to the solution
of the predictive model, using the simpliﬁed equation syste m (equation 5.13) with the
reference set of initial conditions (equation 5.14).
This model allows to capture the evolution of the mean crater radius ( e.g.Engel 1967 , ﬁgure
3). The velocity ﬁeld has a /u1D459=0 (ﬁgure 10a) and/u1D459=1 (ﬁgure 10b) radial components and a
/u1D459=0 (ﬁgure 10c) and/u1D459=1 (ﬁgure 10d) polar components. This allows to obtain a velocity
ﬁeld qualitatively similar to the experiments, including i n particular a degree /u1D459=1 of the
radial component, and a polar component. However, the slope s of the velocity components
are smaller than the experimental slopes, in particular the 1//u1D45F2slope of/u1D462/u1D45F,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461). The main
limitations of Engel (1967)’s model are the ﬁxed hemispherical geometry of the crater a nd
the arbitrary velocity potential deﬁned to ﬁt experimental observations of the velocity ﬁeld.
More importantly, this velocity potential (equation 4.1) corresponds to the ﬂow around an
expanding cylinder (with /u1D45Fbeing the distance from the cylinder axis, and /u1D703the angular
position around this axis) rather than around an expanding s phere, as incorrectly assumed in
Engel (1967). It is not a solution of the Laplace equation in spherical co ordinates and has a
non-zero divergence.
4.2.Maxwell (1977)’s model
Maxwell (1977)’s model assumes an empirical form of the velocity ﬁeld base d on planetary
cratering observations. The model assumes that the radial c omponent /u1D462/u1D45Fis independent of /u1D703
and that its radial dependency is a power /u1D44Dof the radius /u1D45F./u1D462/u1D703is then calculated using ﬂuid15
incompressibility. The velocity ﬁeld thus writes
/braceleftBigg
/u1D462/u1D45F=/u1D6FC(/u1D461)
/u1D45F/u1D44D
/u1D462/u1D703=(/u1D44D−2)sin/u1D703
1+cos/u1D703/u1D6FC(/u1D461)
/u1D45F/u1D44D, (4.3)
where/u1D6FC(/u1D461)is an arbitrary coeﬃcient corresponding to the time-depend ent ﬂow intensity.
According to Maxwell (1977) and Melosh (1989), the value /u1D44D=3 gives a velocity ﬁeld
consistent with numerical simulations of explosion and pla netary impacts.
This model allows to predict the experimental /u1D462/u1D45F,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)(ﬁgure 10a),/u1D462/u1D703,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)(ﬁgure 10c)
and/u1D462/u1D703,1(/u1D45F,/u1D461)(ﬁgure 10d) using/u1D44D=3 and/u1D6FC(/u1D461)=1. In particular, the slopes predicted by
the model are very close to the experimental slopes. However , this model does not allow a
degree/u1D459=1 of the radial velocity component. The main limitations of Maxwell (1977)’s
model are the arbitrary choice for the model time-dependenc y, with/u1D6FC(/u1D461), the fact that /u1D44D
could depend on /u1D703, which would yield a degree /u1D459=1 for/u1D462/u1D45F, and the fact that Maxwell’s ﬂow
is not potential, which is inconsistent with the experiment al results (ﬁgure 6).
4.3.Leng (2001)’s model
Leng (2001)’s model is similar to Engel (1967)’s model since it uses a hemispherical crater
with a radius /u1D4450(/u1D461)and a potential ﬂow. The velocity potential /u1D719writes
/u1D719=−∝dotacc/u1D4450/u1D4452
0
/u1D45F, (4.4)
which allows to obtain the velocity components /u1D462/u1D45Fand/u1D462/u1D703of the velocity ﬁeld
/braceleftBigg
/u1D462/u1D45F=∝dotacc/u1D4450/u1D4452
0
/u1D45F2
/u1D462/u1D703=0. (4.5)
This velocity potential satisﬁes the boundary conditions a nd is a solution of the Laplace
equation in spherical coordinates.
This model allows, in particular, to capture the evolution o f the mean crater radius using
an energy balance, although it requires to multiply the kine tic energy and the total energy
by empirical correction factors ( e.g.Lherm et al. 2022). However, the velocity ﬁeld has only
a degree/u1D459=0 (ﬁgure 10a) on the radial component and no polar component. As for Engel
(1967)’s model, the 1 //u1D45F2slope of/u1D462/u1D45F,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)is smaller than the experimental slope. The main
limitations of Leng (2001)’s model are the hemispherical geometry and the oversimpli ﬁed
velocity potential which prevents a polar dependency of the radial component and a polar
component of the velocity ﬁeld.
4.4.Bisighini et al. (2010)’s model
Bisighini et al. (2010)’s model assumes an expanding spherical crater able to tran slate
vertically over time, with a radius /u1D4450(/u1D461)and a vertical position of the crater barycenter
/u1D467/u1D450(/u1D461). This allows to deﬁne a velocity potential /u1D719which corresponds to the superposition
between the radial expansion of the crater and the ﬂow past a t ranslating sphere. This potential
satisﬁes the boundary conditions and the Laplace equation i n spherical coordinates. In the
moving sphere coordinate system (/u1D45F′,/u1D703′), it writes
/u1D719=−∝dotacc/u1D4450/u1D4452

Bisighini et al. (2010) then use an unsteady Bernoulli equation to determine the ev olution
of the sphere radius and position over time. To compare Bisighini et al. (2010)’s model
with our experimental data, we need to calculate the corresp onding velocity ﬁeld in the
ﬁxed frame of reference by adding the velocity of the crater b arycenter ∝dotacc/u1D467/u1D450(cos/u1D703,−sin/u1D703)to
equation 4.7, and expressing /u1D45F′and/u1D703′as functions of /u1D45Fand/u1D703(/u1D45F′=/radicalbig

The velocity ﬁeld has a /u1D459=0 (ﬁgure 10a) and a/u1D459=1 (ﬁgure 10b) radial component,
as well as a /u1D459=0 (ﬁgure 10c) and a/u1D459=1 (ﬁgure 10d) polar component. The coeﬃcients
are calculated using /u1D467/u1D450=0 and∝dotacc/u1D467/u1D450=0.2/u1D448/u1D456, which corresponds to typical values during
crater opening ( e.g.ﬁgure 5). This model explains relatively well the shape of the crate r (e.g.
Bisighini et al. 2010, ﬁgure 17), and the key tendencies of the experimental compo nents of
the velocity ﬁeld. However, Bisighini et al. (2010)’s model strongly constrains the geometry
of the crater, as well as the related velocity potential deﬁn ition. As in Engel (1967)’s and
Leng (2001)’s models, the 1 //u1D45F2slope of/u1D462/u1D45F,0is smaller than the experimental slope.
4.5.Towards a new model
In all models, either the geometry of the velocity ﬁeld ( Engel 1967 ;Maxwell 1977 ;Leng
2001) or the shape of the cavity ( Engel 1967 ;Leng 2001 ;Bisighini et al. 2010) are imposed.
This leads in particular to an incorrect radial dependency o f/u1D462/u1D45F, with an exponent much
larger in the experiments than in the models, except for Maxwell (1977)’s model where the
radial dependency is arbitrarily imposed by the parameter /u1D44D. The experimental observation
that the radial velocity ﬁeld decreases with /u1D45Ffaster than 1 //u1D45F2is unexpected since it suggests
that the ﬂow component associated with an isotropic expansi on of the cavity ( ∝1//u1D45F2) is not
dominant. New models are thus required to explain the geomet ry of the experimental velocity
ﬁeld, as well as the evolution of the non-hemispherical shap e of the cavity. In the following
section, we develop a semi-analytical model based on a Legen dre polynomials expansion of
an unsteady Bernoulli equation, coupled with a kinematic bo undary condition at the crater
boundary.
5. Legendre polynomials model
In this model, we assume that the ﬂuid is inviscid ( i.e./u1D707=0), incompressible ( i.e.∇·/u1D496=0),
and that the ﬂow is irrotational ( i.e.∇ ×/u1D496=0). This means that the ﬂow is potential and
satisﬁes the Laplace equation ∇2/u1D719=0, where/u1D719is the velocity potential deﬁned as /u1D496=∇/u1D719.
In the spherical coordinate system (/u1D45F,/u1D703,/u1D711), assuming an axisymmetric ﬂow, the solution of
the Laplace equation writes
/u1D719(/u1D45F,/u1D703,/u1D461)=+∞/summationdisplay.1
/u1D45B=0/u1D719/u1D45B(/u1D461)
/u1D45F/u1D45B+1/u1D443/u1D45B(cos/u1D703), (5.1)17
where/u1D719/u1D45B(/u1D461)are time-dependent coeﬃcients and /u1D443/u1D45B(/u1D465)are the standard Legendre polyno-
mials, orthogonal on [−1,1]. The components /u1D462/u1D45Fand/u1D462/u1D703of the velocity ﬁeld then writes
/braceleftBigg
/u1D462/u1D45F(/u1D45F,/u1D703,/u1D461)=/u1D715/u1D719

/u1D715/u1D703. (5.2)
We also assume a non-hemispherical crater, where the shape o f the cavity is decomposed on
a set of shifted Legendre polynomials (equation 2.2).
Since we assume that the ﬂuid is inviscid and a potential ﬂow, the ﬂow is governed by an
unsteady Bernoulli equation
/u1D715/u1D719

where/u1D70Cis the ﬂuid density, /u1D462is the norm of the velocity, /u1D45Dis the pressure, /u1D454is the acceleration
due to gravity and /u1D467is the vertical coordinate below the initial ﬂuid surface. T his equation
is constant in the entire ﬂuid domain. Far from the crater, /u1D462→0,/u1D719→0 and the pressure
is hydrostatic /u1D45D(/u1D467)=/u1D45D0+/u1D70C/u1D454/u1D467, where/u1D45D0is the atmospheric pressure. This means that the
constant is equal to /u1D45D0//u1D70C.
At the crater boundary, i.e.at/u1D45F=/u1D445(/u1D703,/u1D461)(equation 2.2), the Young-Laplace equation
writes
/u1D45D(/u1D445) −/u1D45D0=/u1D70E/u1D436, (5.4)
where/u1D436(/u1D703,/u1D461)is the mean local curvature of the interface and /u1D70Ethe surface tension. In
cylindrical coordinates, the curvature writes

We also use a kinematic boundary condition at the crater boun dary

Equations 5.6and5.7are made dimensionless using the scaling laws for the crater opening

Note that the crater position /u1D445∗(/u1D703,/u1D461∗)is written as a sum of shifted Legendre polynomials,
while the velocity potential /u1D719∗(/u1D45F∗,/u1D703,/u1D461∗)is a sum of standard Legendre polynomials.
We then project the diﬀerential equation system (equation 5.8) on a set of shifted Legendre
polynomials ¯/u1D443/u1D45Aup to degree /u1D45A/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465=2 for the Bernoulli equation and degree /u1D45A/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465=1 for

We simplify the equations by expanding the Bernoulli equati on and the kinematic boundary
condition to the third and the fourth order in /u1D445∗

ﬁve unknowns /u1D719∗

The general equation system (equation 5.8) and its projection (equations A 1-A 5) may
be further simpliﬁed. The third term on the right-hand side o f the Bernoulli equation (in
equation 5.8) corresponds to surface tension eﬀects associated with the curvature of the
air-water interface. If this term is neglected, which corre sponds to√

In our experiments,√
/u1D439/u1D45F//u1D44A/u1D452is two to three times larger for case A (1 .0×10−1) than for
cases B, C and D (4 .9×10−2, 3.9×10−2and 3.3×10−2, respectively). This is consistent with
the surface tension argument used to explain the diﬀerence b etween case A and the other
cases (§ 3). Since/u1D709is independent of /u1D439/u1D45Fand/u1D44A/u1D452in our experimental range ( Lherm et al.
2022), this normalised equation system without surface tension is independent of the impact
parameters and may be used to provide a predictive model.
The general and the simpliﬁed equation systems are solved nu merically as initial value
problems, using a diﬀerential equation solver. The solutio n thus depends on the choice
of initial conditions. On one hand, we can solve the equation systems separately for each
experiment. The initial conditions are deﬁned at ˜/u1D461=1, which corresponds to an advection
time of the impacting drop, and ﬁtted on each experiment by us ing a joint least-square
inversion of the ﬁve experimental coeﬃcients over the entir e time series. On the other hand,
we can solve the equation systems at the same time for all the e xperiments. The initial
conditions are also deﬁned at ˜/u1D461=1 but ﬁtted simultaneously on all the experiments using
the joint least-square inversion over the entire time serie s. This method allows to deﬁne a
unique set of initial conditions that may be used in a predict ive model. In both cases, the
ﬁtting procedure is motivated by the sensitivity of the mode l to the initial conditions used.
A slight modiﬁcation of the initial conditions may change si gniﬁcantly the time evolution of
the coeﬃcients. This sensitivity might be related to the exa ct impact conditions, including a
possible variability in the contact dynamics with the surfa ce of the pool and in the shape of
the drop upon impact. Furthermore, the sensitivity to initi al conditions might be ampliﬁed by
the truncation of the crater shape and of the velocity potent ial expansion, which is probably19
insuﬃcient to model properly the early evolution of the crat er. This sensitivity is investigated
in more detail in appendix B.
We now deﬁne two models using diﬀerent systems of equations a nd deﬁnitions of initial
conditions. The ﬁrst model, referred to as the general model , accounts for surface energy
eﬀects and uses the general equation system (equation 5.8) and initial conditions ﬁtted on
single experiments. This means that the number of sets of ini tial conditions is equal to the
number of experiments. For example, the initial conditions of a given experiment in case B
are/u1D719∗
0(1)=−0.07±0.02,/u1D719∗
1(1)=−0.07±0.02,/u1D719∗
2(1)=0.009±0.003,/u1D445∗
0(1)=0.41±0.03
and/u1D445∗
1(1)=−0.28±0.02. Uncertainties on the coeﬃcients correspond to 1 −/u1D70Estandard
deviations on the parameters in the least-square inversion . The initial conditions of all the
experiments are presented in appendix B. The second model, referred to as the simpliﬁed
model, uses the simpliﬁed equation system, without surface tension and independent of the
impact parameters (equation 5.13), as well as initial conditions ﬁtted on all the experiments .
The reference set of initial conditions is
/braceleftbigg/u1D719∗
0(1)=−0.21±0.01, /u1D719∗
1(1)=0.002±0.005, /u1D719∗

/u1D445∗
0(1)=0.29±0.02, /u1D445∗
1(1)=−0.39±0.02.(5.14)
Given the uncertainties, this set of initial conditions can be further simpliﬁed by using /u1D719∗
1(1)=
/u1D719∗
2(1)=0, which corresponds to an initial velocity ﬁeld given by (/u1D462∗
/u1D45F=−/u1D719∗
0(1)//u1D45F∗2,/u1D462∗
/u1D703=0).
The physical interpretation of these initial conditions sh ould be investigated in the future. It
probably involves the contact dynamics between the drop and the pool and the early evolution
of the crater. Nonetheless, the simpliﬁed model is a predict ive model, independent of the
impact parameters, that can be used to predict the crater and velocity ﬁeld evolution within
the range of /u1D439/u1D45Fand/u1D44A/u1D452covered by our experiments. However, we anticipate the mode l
to show predictability limitations outside of this range, i n particular at low /u1D439/u1D45Fand/u1D44A/u1D452in
the bubble entrapment region ( e.g.Pumphrey & Elmore 1990 ), due to the neglected surface
tension term and more generally to the relatively low degree of truncation used in our model.

components (equation 5.2). We also obtain the experimental crater shape coeﬃcients b y ﬁtting
the crater boundary position with the shifted Legendre poly nomials expansion (equation 2.2),
using the method described in § 2.4.1.
The models capture well the evolution of the velocity potent ial (ﬁgure 11a-c) for all cases.
In detail, the models are dominated by /u1D719∗
1and are slightly less accurate when it comes to ﬁt
/u1D719∗
2, as expected since this corresponds to velocity ﬂuctuation s on smaller scales. These results
are consistent with the good agreement between the simpliﬁe d model and the experimental
velocity coeﬃcients of ﬁgure 10, in particular regarding the slope of /u1D462/u1D45F,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461). Although
/u1D462/u1D45F,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)remains less steep than in the experiments, it decreases sig niﬁcantly faster than
1//u1D45F2. The models also capture well the evolution of the crater sha pe (ﬁgure 11d-e). Note that
˜/u1D445/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465slightly overestimates the experimental maximum crater ra dius, with maximum /u1D445∗
0systematically smaller than 1. This can be explained by the n eglected surface energy in the
energy balance ( Lherm et al. 2022). In detail, /u1D445∗

higher rate than experimental data when ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/lessorsimilar0.4 and ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465/greaterorsimilar1.7. This corresponds
respectively to the early opening of the crater and the end of crater collapse, including the
formation of the central jet, where an expansion of /u1D445to a higher degree (at least /u1D458=2)
would be required to model the observed degree of deformatio n of the cavity ( e.g.ﬁgure 4c).20

normalised by the opening timescale of the crater ˜/u1D461/˜/u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465, in the four cases. For each case,
the diﬀerent types of markers correspond to diﬀerent experi ments. The coloured solid
lines give the solution of the general model, where the initi al conditions are ﬁtted on a
single experiment of the corresponding case. The black soli d lines give a solution to the
simpliﬁed model, where the initial conditions are ﬁtted sim ultaneously on all the
experiments. The black dashed lines give a solution to the si mpliﬁed model, where the
initial conditions are modiﬁed by ±25% with respect to their reference value.
Note that the predictive model, using the simpliﬁed equatio n system (equation 5.13) with
the reference set of initial conditions (equation 5.14), is particularly in good agreement with
the experimental data. The sensitivity of the simpliﬁed mod el to the initial conditions is
illustrated with two solutions where the initial condition s have been modiﬁed by ±25% with
respect to their reference value (ﬁgure 11, black dashed lines).
Although case A is slightly diﬀerent from cases B, C and D due t o surface tension eﬀects
(see § 3), the models capture properly the general cratering dynami cs. In detail, /u1D719∗

Figure 12compares snapshots of the radial (a-b) and polar components (c-d) of the ex-
perimental velocity ﬁeld (a-c) with the components calcula ted from the predictive simpliﬁed
model (b-d), in case B. The comparison is conducted at diﬀere nt times during the opening
stage (i), just before the crater reaches its maximum size (i i), and during the closing stage
(iii). This illustrates that the velocity ﬁelds from the sim pliﬁed model and the experiment are
very similar during all stages of the cratering process. The diﬀerences observed are mainly
in the magnitude of the velocity, in particular close to the c rater and the initial water surface
(/u1D703=±/u1D70B/2). Similar results are obtained in the other cases. The good agreement between the
experimental velocity ﬁeld and the simpliﬁed model shows th at the truncation used in the
model (degree /u1D458=1 in shifted Legendre polynomials for /u1D445∗and degree /u1D45B=2 in Legendre
polynomials for /u1D719∗) is suﬃcient to accurately capture the ﬂow dynamics.

model. The crater shape is well captured by the model, consis tently with the results of ﬁgure
11d-e. In detail, at the very beginning of the crater opening st age (ﬁgure 13, i), the model
overestimates the width of the crater and does not capture ac curately the ﬂat-bottomed shape
of the cavity. During the crater opening stage and the beginn ing of the crater collapse stage
(ﬁgure 13, iii-v), the model slightly underestimates the crater dept h and width, consistently
with the coeﬃcients of ﬁgure 11d-e. Finally, when the crater collapses (ﬁgure 13, vi), the
model shows the central jet initiation, although it visibly lacks higher degrees to account
for the vertical walls of the cavity. Figure 13also compares the experimental velocity ﬁeld
obtained in case B with the velocity ﬁeld obtained from the si mpliﬁed model. The comparison
shows a good agreement between the two, which is consistent w ith the analysis of ﬁgure 12.22

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we analyse quantitatively the velocity ﬁeld a round the crater produced by the
impact of a liquid drop onto a deep liquid pool. Using new high -resolution PIV measurements,
we obtain simultaneously the evolution of the velocity ﬁeld around the cavity and the crater
shape. We found that the shape of the cavity and the velocity ﬁ eld seem to be independent
of/u1D439/u1D45Fand/u1D44A/u1D452at a given /u1D461//u1D461/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465, when these two dimensionless numbers are large enough
(cases B, C and D). The velocity ﬁeld is dominated by the degre es 0 and 1 in terms of shifted
Legendre polynomials, with the degree 0 of the radial compon ent/u1D462/u1D45F,0(/u1D45F,/u1D461)decreasing faster
than 1//u1D45F2. Furthermore, the radial component of the velocity ﬁeld is d ominated by the degree
1 in terms of standard Legendre polynomials. This is not inco nsistent with the growth of the
crater because the degree 1 of the radial component has a non- zero average over a hemisphere.
The experiments also show signiﬁcant contributions from th e degree 2, in particular when the
crater is strongly deformed. This is possibly related to the non-hemispherical shape (degree
1) of the cavity. We also found that the velocity ﬁeld does not vanish when the crater reaches
its maximum size.
In the previous velocity models ( Engel 1967 ;Maxwell 1977 ;Leng 2001 ;Bisighini et al.
2010), strong constraints were imposed on the crater shape and/o r on the velocity ﬁeld.
They were unable to explain the properties observed in our ex perimental measurements,23
in particular the radial dependency of the radial component of the velocity ﬁeld and the
evolution of the shape of the cavity. We thus developed a semi -analytical model based on a
Legendre polynomials expansion of an unsteady Bernoulli eq uation, coupled with a kinematic
boundary condition at the crater boundary. Assuming that th e surface tension term involved
in the Bernoulli equation is negligible, we deﬁne a simpliﬁe d model, independent of the
impact parameters, that can predict the evolution of the cra ter shape and of the velocity ﬁeld
within the range of /u1D439/u1D45Fand/u1D44A/u1D452numbers covered in our experiments. Although the model is
sensitive to the initial conditions, it remains predictive by using a unique set of ﬁtted initial
conditions. In particular, the model can capture the initia tion of the central jet. However, one
intrinsic limitation of the model is that it assumes the cavi ty radius to be a bĳective function
of/u1D703. While this assumption is true during the opening stage and p art of the crater closing
stage, including the central jet initiation, it eventually fails when the central jet reaches a
critical height, since the air/water interface can be cross ed twice at a given /u1D703. The model can
therefore not be used to describe the full growth of the centr al jet.

Appendix A. Equations of the Legendre polynomials model
The Legendre polynomials model equations correspond to the projection of equation 5.8
up to degree /u1D45A/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465=1 for the kinematic boundary condition and up to degree /u1D45A/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D465=2
for the Bernoulli equation. The projected boundary conditi ons and Bernoulli equations are

Appendix B. Initial conditions of the Legendre polynomials model
Figure 14shows the initial conditions of the general model, obtained by ﬁtting individually
the experiments, and of the simpliﬁed model, obtained by ﬁtt ing all the experiments
simultaneously. They are both deﬁned at ˜/u1D461=1 and use a joint least-square inversion of the
experimental coeﬃcients over the entire time series. Uncer tainties on the initial conditions
correspond to 1 −/u1D70Estandard deviations on the parameters in the least-square i nversion.

/u1D439/u1D45F//u1D44A/u1D452, corresponding to moderate /u1D439/u1D45Fand/u1D44A/u1D452numbers (case
A), the initial conditions are clustered within the inversi on uncertainties. This dispersion at
higher/u1D439/u1D45Fand/u1D44A/u1D452suggests a higher variability of the crater shape and of the v elocity ﬁeld
upon impact. This might be related to a greater sensitivity t o the exact impact conditions,
possibly including variability in the contact dynamics wit h the surface of the pool and in
the shape of the drop upon impact. Furthermore, we do not ﬁnd a ny secondary dependency
on/u1D439/u1D45For/u1D44A/u1D452. Finally, the initial conditions of the simpliﬁed model, ob tained by ﬁtting
all the experiments simultaneously, are similar to the init ial conditions obtained by ﬁtting
individually the experiments.
The relatively large dispersion observed for a given case (e xcept for case A) indicates
that the model is sensitive to the initial conditions. For ex ample, a change in all the initial
conditions by ±25% gives a signiﬁcantly modiﬁed evolution of the coeﬃcient s over time
(ﬁgure 11, black dashed lines). In order to further investigate this i nitial condition sensitivity,
we conducted a quantitative test on the simpliﬁed model. Fig ure15shows the relative change
of the model coeﬃcients with respect to the simpliﬁed model, as a result of an individual
modiﬁcation of a single initial condition from the referenc e value deﬁned in equation 5.14.
The relative change /u1D6FF/u1D44Bis deﬁned as the absolute change in /u1D44B={/u1D719∗

0,/u1D445∗
1},/u1D44B−/u1D44Bref,
scaled by the root mean square of the simpliﬁed model RMS (/u1D44Bref). We choose to scale the
absolute change by the root mean square of the simpliﬁed mode l to ensure a non-diverging
value of the relative change when /u1D44Bref→0. Note that this sensitivity test only investigates the
role of independent parameter modiﬁcations. Coupled modiﬁ cations of the initial conditions26

1(e), obtained using a joint least-square
inversion of the experimental coeﬃcients over the entire ti me series. The coloured
markers correspond to the general model, where initial cond itions are obtained by ﬁtting
experiments individually. The black circles correspond to the simpliﬁed model, where
initial conditions are obtained by ﬁtting all the experimen ts simultaneously. Uncertainties
correspond to 1 −/u1D70Estandard deviations on the parameters in the least-square i nversion.
(as in ﬁgure 11, black dashed lines) might amplify signiﬁcantly the change s in the evolution
of the coeﬃcients.
Within the range of parameter modiﬁcations (by ±40%), the coeﬃcients are generally
more inﬂuenced by modiﬁcations of the initial conditions of the crater shape, i.e./u1D445∗
0(1)
(ﬁgure 15d) and/u1D445∗
1(1)(ﬁgure 15e). Besides, the coeﬃcient /u1D445∗
0is the least modiﬁed with
a maximum change of ∼30% (ﬁgure 15iv), while /u1D719∗
0,/u1D719∗
1,/u1D719∗
2and/u1D445∗
1reach respectively
∼300% (ﬁgure 15i),∼150% (ﬁgure 15ii),∼200% (ﬁgure 15iii) and∼100% (ﬁgure 15v).
Finally, the change in the coeﬃcients over time is not homoge neous. For example, /u1D719∗
0is
changed relatively uniformly over time (in magnitude), ind ependently of the modiﬁed initial
condition, while /u1D719∗
2is changed much more heterogeneously and depends on the modi ﬁed
initial condition.
