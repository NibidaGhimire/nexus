Abstract. Suppose that a ﬁnite group Gadmits a soluble group of coprime automor-
phismsA. We prove that if, for some positive integer m, every element of the centralizer
CG(A) has a left Engel sink of cardinality at most m(or a right Engel sink of cardinality
at mostm), thenGhas a subgroup of ( |A|,m)-bounded index which has Fitting height at
most 2α(A)+2, where α(A) is the composition length of A. We also prove that if, for some
positive integer r, every element of the centralizer CG(A) has a left Engel sink of rank at
mostr(or a right Engel sink of rank at most r), thenGhas a subgroup of ( |A|,r)-bounded
index which has Fitting height at most 4α(A)+ 4α(A) + 3. Here, a left Engel sink of an
elementgof a group Gis a set E(g) such that for every x∈Gall suﬃciently long commu-
tators [...[[x,g],g],...,g] belong to E(g). (Thus, gis a left Engel element precisely when we
can choose E(g) ={1}.) A right Engel sink of an element gof a group Gis a set R(g) such
that for every x∈Gall suﬃciently long commutators [ ...[[g,x],x],...,x] belong to R(g).
(Thus,gis a right Engel element precisely when we can choose R(g) ={1}.)
1.Introduction
Studying ﬁnite groups in relation to ﬁxed points of their automorphis ms is one of the
mainstays of research in group theory contributing to structura l results and driving devel-
opment of new methods. One of the best-known examples is J. Thom pson’s theorem [1] on
the nilpotency of a ﬁnite group with a ﬁxed-point-free automorphis m of prime order. Using
the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups, P. Rowley [2] showed that a ﬁ nite group with a
ﬁxed-point-free automorphism of any order is soluble.
Studying groups with ‘almost ﬁxed-point-free’ automorphisms ref ers to a more general
situation, when a group of automorphisms A/lessorequalslantAutGmay have non-trivial ﬁxed-point
subgroup CG(A), which is assumed to be ‘small’ in one way or another. The usual goal is to
prove that the group is ‘almost’ as nice as in the ﬁxed-point-free ca se, where ‘almost’ means
modulo ‘pieces’ commensurable in one way or another with the ﬁxed-p oint subgroup CG(A).
J. Thompson [3] proved that the Fitting height of a ﬁnite soluble grou pGwith a soluble
group of automorphisms Aof coprime order is bounded in terms of the Fitting height of
CG(A) and the composition length α(A) ofA. (Recall that the Fitting height is the length
of a shortest normal series with nilpotent factors.) Thompson’s pa per inspired numerous
subsequent papers dedicated to similar problems. Some of the best results in this area were
obtainedbyA.Turull; seehissurvey[4]. UsingTurull’sresultsB.Hartle yandI.M.Isaacs[5]

1order, then the index |G:F2α(A)+1(G)|is bounded in terms of |CG(A)|and|A|, where
F2α(A)+1(G) is the corresponding term of the Fitting series.
It is worth mentioning that when a group of automorphisms A/lessorequalslantAutGis not nilpotent,
the coprimeness condition is essential for obtaining bounds of the F itting height even in the
ﬁxed-point-free case CG(A) = 1, as shown by examples of S. D. Bell and B. Hartley [6].
But for a nilpotent group of automorphisms A/lessorequalslantAutGof a ﬁnite soluble group Gsuch
thatCG(A) = 1 the Fitting height of Gis bounded in terms of α(A) even without the
coprimeness condition; this is a special case of a theorem of E. C. Da de [7] who proved that
the Fitting height of a ﬁnite soluble group Gis bounded in terms of α(H), where His a
Carter subgroup of G.
While the aforementioned results dealt with restrictions on the orde r ofCG(A) or its Fit-
tingheight, other‘smallness’ conditions on CG(A) hadbeen successfully used. E. I. Khukhro
and V. D. Mazurov [8, 9, 10, 11] considered ﬁnite groups G(not assumed to be soluble)
having a group of automorphisms Awith ﬁxed-point subgroup CG(A) of given rank r. Here
the rank of a group His the minimum positive integer rsuch that every subgroup of Hcan
be generated by relements. One of the results in [9, 11], when Ais soluble and has coprime
order, is a bound for the rank of G/F4α(A)−1in terms of rand|A|.
In the present paper we consider ﬁnite groups Gwith a soluble group of automorphisms
Aof coprime order such that all elements of CG(A) satisfy Engel-type conditions, which are
expressed in terms of so-called Engel sinks (see the deﬁnition below ). Given the maximum
cardinality mof these sinks, we prove that the index |G:F2α(A)+2(G)|is bounded in terms
ofmand|A|(Theorem 1.1). Given the maximum rank rof these sinks, we prove that the
rank ofG/F4α(A)+4α(A)+3(G) is bounded in terms of rand|A|(Corollary 1.4), and if Gis
in addition soluble, then the index |G:F4α(A)+4α(A)+3(G)|is bounded in terms of rand
|A|(Theorem 1.3). The results obtained are in line with the studies of ‘almo st ﬁxed-point-
free’ automorphisms: if all elements of CG(A) are left or right Engel (that is, their left or
right Engel sinks are trivial), then CG(A)/lessorequalslantF(G) by R. Baer’s theorem [12, 12.3.7], so
thatAinduces a ﬁxed-point-free group of automorphism on G/F(G), and therefore Gis
soluble by a theorem of Y. M. Wang and Z. M. Chen [13] based on the cla ssiﬁcation of ﬁnite
simple groups, and the Fitting height of Gis bounded in terms of α(A) by J. Thompson’s
theorem [3] (with the improved bound 2 α(A) of A. Turull [14]).
In order to state the precise results, we need the corresponding deﬁnitions. We use the
left-normed simple commutator notation [ a1,a2,a3,...,a r] := [...[[a1,a2],a3],...,a r] and the
abbreviation [ a,kb] := [a,b,b,...,b ] wherebis repeated ktimes.
Deﬁnition. Aleft Engel sink of an element gof a group Gis a set E(g) such that for every
x∈Gall suﬃciently long commutators [ x,g,g,...,g ] belong to E(g), that is, for every
x∈Gthere is a positive integer l(x,g) such that [ x,lg]∈E(g) for alll/greaterorequalslantl(x,g).
(Thus,gis a left Engel element precisely when we can choose E(g) ={1}, andGis an
Engel group when we can choose E(g) ={1}for allg∈G.)
Deﬁnition. Aright Engel sink of an element gof a group Gis a set R(g) such that for
everyx∈Gall suﬃciently long commutators [ g,x,x,...,x ] belong to R(g), that is, for
everyx∈Gthere is a positive integer r(x,g) such that [ x,rg]∈R(g) for allr/greaterorequalslantr(x,g).
2(Thus,gis a right Engel element precisely when we can choose R(g) ={1}, andGis an
Engel group when we can choose R(g) ={1}for allg∈G.)
WhenGis a ﬁnite group, every element has the smallest left Engel sink, since the inter-
section of two left Engel sinks E′(g) and E′′(g) is again a left Engel sink of g. Similarly,
every element g∈Ghas thesmallest right Engel sink. In this paper we shall always use the
notation E(g) and R(g) to denote the smallest left and right Engel sinks of g, respectively,
thus eliminating the ambiguity of this notation in the above deﬁnitions. In cases where
we need to consider the left or right Engel sink constructed with re spect to a subgroup H
containing g, we write EH(g) orRH(g), respectively.
Deﬁnition. We say for short that an element gof a group Ghas aleft(or right)Engel sink
of rank at most rif there is a subgroup of rank at most rthat is a left (respectively, right)
Engel sink of g. This is equivalent to the subgroup /an}bracketle{tE(g)/an}bracketri}ht(respectively, /an}bracketle{tR(g)/an}bracketri}ht) having
rank at most r.
Recall that the Fitting series starts with the Fitting subgroup F1(G) =F(G), which
is the largest normal nilpotent subgroup, and then by induction, Fk+1(G) is the inverse
image of F(G/Fk(G)). The Fitting height of a ﬁnite soluble group Gis the least hsuch
thatFh(G) =G. Throughout the paper we write, say, “( a,b,...)-bounded” to abbreviate
“bounded above in terms of a,b,...only”. We can now state the main results of the paper,
the ﬁrst of which relates to the cardinalities of Engel sinks.
Theorem 1.1. LetGbe a ﬁnite group admitting a soluble group of automorphisms Aof
order coprime to |G|.Letmbe a positive integer such that either
(a)every element g∈CG(A)has a left Engel sink EG(g)of cardinality at most m,or
(b)every element g∈CG(A)has a right Engel sink RG(g)of cardinality at most m.
Then the index of the soluble radical |G:S(G)|is bounded in terms of m,and the index
|G:F2α(A)+2(G)|is bounded in terms of |A|andm,whereα(A)is the composition length
ofA.
Here we used the subscript GinEG(g) and RG(g) to emphasize that these sinks are
considered in the whole group G.
Itisnotyetclearifonecanexcludethedependenceon |A|intheconclusionofTheorem1.1
for the index |G:F2α(A)+2(G)|. This is known to be possible when |A|is a prime: in [15]
we considered a group Gsatisfying the conditions of Theorem 1.1 when Ais of prime order
and proved that then in case (a) the group Ghas a metanilpotent normal subgroup of m-
bounded index, and in case (b) the group Ghas a nilpotent normal subgroup of m-bounded
index. The proof of Theorem 1.1 relies on several useful lemmas in [1 5]. Furthermore, the
fact that |G:S(G)|ism-bounded has already been established in [15, Proposition 3.2], so
the new information in Theorem 1.1 relates to the index |G:F2α(A)+2(G)|.
The other two main results relate to the rank of Engel sinks.
Theorem 1.2. LetGbe a ﬁnite group admitting a soluble group of automorphisms Aof
order coprime to |G|.Letrbe a positive integer such that every element g∈CG(A)has a
left or right Engel sink /an}bracketle{tEG(g)/an}bracketri}htor/an}bracketle{tRG(g)/an}bracketri}htof rank at most r.Then the rank of the quotient
G/S(G)by the soluble radical is bounded in terms of r.
3In Theorem 1.2, “left or right” is applied individually to elements of CG(A), so that it
may be diﬀerent, left or right, Engel sinks for diﬀerent elements of CG(A).
Theorem 1.3. LetGbe a soluble ﬁnite group admitting a soluble group of automor phisms
Aof order coprime to |G|.Letrbe a positive integer such that either
(a)every element g∈CG(A)has a left Engel sink /an}bracketle{tEG(g)/an}bracketri}htof rank at most r,or
(b)every element g∈CG(A)has a right Engel sink /an}bracketle{tRG(g)/an}bracketri}htof rank at most r.
Then the index |G:F4α(A)+4α(A)+3(G)|is bounded in terms of |A|andr,whereα(A)is the
composition length of A.
Combination of Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 yields the following.
Corollary 1.4. LetGbe a ﬁnite group admitting a soluble group of automorphisms Aof
order coprime to |G|.Letrbe a positive integer such that either
(a)every element g∈CG(A)has a left Engel sink /an}bracketle{tEG(g)/an}bracketri}htof rank at most r,or
(b)every element g∈CG(A)has a right Engel sink /an}bracketle{tRG(g)/an}bracketri}htof rank at most r.
Then the rank of G/F4α(A)+4α(A)+3(G)is bounded in terms of |A|andr,whereα(A)is the
composition length of A.
Note that while it is well-known that the inverse of a right Engel elemen t is left Engel,
there is no such a straightforward connection between left and rig ht Engel sinks, and parts
(b) in Theorems 1.1 and 1.3 and Corollary 1.4 are not consequences of parts (a). Rather,
the proofs of these parts are similar and are mostly conducted simu ltaneously.
Other results concerning automorphisms whose ﬁxed points satisf y restrictions on their
Engel sinks were obtained in [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Generalizations of Engel conditions
for ﬁnite, proﬁnite, and compact groups using the concept of Eng el sinks were considered
in [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28]. The natural aim of such studies is proving t hat groups (in certain
classes) that have ‘small’ Engel sinks have properties close to the n ice properties of Engel
groups (in which the sinks are trivial). As examples of such nice prope rties we mention that
ﬁnite Engel groups are nilpotent by M. Zorn’s theorem [12, 12.3.4], wh ile J. S. Wilson and
E. I. Zelmanov [29] proved that proﬁnite Engel groups are locally nilp otent. At the same
time, E. S. Golod’s examples [30] show that Engel groups in general m ay not be locally
nilpotent.
For ﬁnite groups we proved in [23] and [25] the following quantitative r esults, which are
used in this paper.

42.Preliminaries
For a group Aacting by automorphisms on a group Bwe use the usual notation for
commutators [ b,a] =b−1baand commutator subgroups [ B,A] =/an}bracketle{t[b,a]|b∈B, a∈A/an}bracketri}ht, as
well as for centralizers CB(A) ={b∈B|ba=bfor alla∈A}andCA(B) ={a∈A|ba=
bfor allb∈B}. We usually denote by the same letter ϕthe automorphism induced by an
automorphism ϕon the quotient by a normal ϕ-invariant subgroup.
We say for short that an automorphism ϕof a ﬁnite group Gis a coprime automorphism
if the orders of ϕandGare coprime: ( |G|,|ϕ|) = 1. The following lemma collects several
well-known properties of coprime automorphisms of ﬁnite groups.
Lemma 2.1. LetAbe a group acting by coprime automorphisms on a ﬁnite group G.
(a)IfNis a normal A-invariant subgroup of G,then the ﬁxed points of Ain the quotient
G/Nare covered by the ﬁxed points of AinG,that is,CG/N(A) =CG(A)N/N.
(b)We have [[G,A],A] = [G,A].
(c)IfGis abelian ,thenG= [G,A]×CG(A).
We shall need another useful lemma on coprime actions.
Lemma 2.2 ([15, Lemma 2.4]) .LetVbe an abelian ﬁnite group ,Ua group of coprime
automorphisms of V,andma positive integer .If|[V,u]|/lessorequalslantmfor every u∈U,then the
order|U|is bounded in terms of m.
Recall that the rank of a ﬁnite group is the minimum positive integer rsuch that every
subgroup of it can be generated by relements. The following result was obtained by
Kov´ acs [31] for soluble groups, and extended independently by Gu ralnick [32] and Lucchini
[33] using the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups (improving a bound 2 dof Longobardi and
Maj [34]).
Lemma 2.3. Ifdis the maximum of the ranks of the Sylow subgroups of a ﬁnite gr oup,
then the rank of this group is at most d+1.
The following lemma appeared independently and simultaneously in the p apers of Gor-
chakov [35], Merzlyakov [36], and as “P. Hall’s lemma” in the paper of Ro seblade [37].
Lemma 2.4. Letpbe a prime number .The rank of a p-group of automorphisms of an
abelian ﬁnite p-group of rank ris bounded in terms of r.
The next two lemmas are also well-known facts.
Lemma 2.5 (see, for example, [24, Lemma 1.3]) .A ﬁnitep′-group of linear transformations
of a vector space of dimension nover a ﬁeld of characteristic phasn-bounded rank .
Lemma 2.6. A group of rank rand of exponent ehas(r,e)-bounded order .
(The proof of this lemma does not have to use the positive solution of the Restricted
Burnside Problem, as it follows from the bounds for the orders of Sy low subgroups, which
can be obtained by using powerful p-groups.)
We now prove a rank analogue of Lemma 2.2.
5Lemma 2.7. LetVbe an elementary abelian ﬁnite p-group,Ua group of coprime auto-
morphisms of V,andra positive integer .If the rank of [V,u]is at most rfor every u∈U,
then the rank of Uis bounded in terms of r.
Proof. We regard Vas a vector space over Fpin additive notation; then the rank of a sub-
group is its dimension. First suppose that Uis abelian. Pick u1∈Usuch that [ V,u1]/ne}ationslash= 0.
By Lemma 2.1(c), V= [V,u1]⊕CV(u1), and both summands are U-invariant, since U
is abelian. If CU([V,u1]) = 1, then the rank of Uisr-bounded by Lemma 2.5. Other-
wise pick 1 /ne}ationslash=u2∈CU([V,u1]); then V= [V,u1]⊕[V,u2]⊕CV(/an}bracketle{tu1,u2/an}bracketri}ht). If 1/ne}ationslash=u3∈
CU([V,u1]⊕[V,u2]), thenV= [V,u1]⊕[V,u2]⊕[V,u3]⊕CV(/an}bracketle{tu1,u2,u3/an}bracketri}ht), and so on. If
CU([V,u1]⊕ ··· ⊕[V,uk]) = 1 at some r-bounded step k, thenUhasr-bounded rank by
Lemma 2.5. However, if there are too many steps, then for the elem entw=u1u2···ukwith
k > rby Lemma 2.1(b) we shall have 0 /ne}ationslash= [V,ui] = [[V,ui],w] for every i= 1,2,...,k, so
that [V,w] = [V,u1]⊕···⊕[V,uk] will have rank greater than r, a contradiction.
We now consider the general case. If Qis a Sylow q-subgroup of U, letMbe a maximal
normal abelian subgroup of Q. By the above, the rank of Misr-bounded. Hence Qhas
r-bounded rank by Lemma 2.4, since CP(M) =MandP/Membeds in the automorphism
group of M. Since the rank of a Sylow q-subgroup of Uisr-bounded for every prime divisor
qof|U|, the rank of Uisr-bounded by Lemma 2.3. /square
We now recall some elementary properties of Engel sinks. The follow ing lemma is a
consequence of the properties of coprime actions and a formula in H . Heineken’s paper [38]
on a connection between left and right Engel commutators.
Lemma 2.8 ([25, Lemma 3.2]) .IfVis an abelian subgroup of a ﬁnite group G,andg∈G
an element normalizing Vsuch that (|V|,|g|) = 1,then
[V,g] =EV/angbracketleftg/angbracketright(g) =RV/angbracketleftg/angbracketright(g).
Remark 2.9. Since the image of a group commutator [ a,kb] under a homomorphism ϑis
the commutator [ aϑ,kbϑ] of the images, for any element gof a group Gand any normal
subgroup Nthe image of a left (right) Engel sink E(g) (respectively, R(g)) inG/Nis a left
(right) Engel sink of the image of g. Furthermore, for any A-invariant section M/N, that is,
a quotient of an A-invariant subgroup Mby anA-invariant subgroup Nnormal in M, the
centralizer of AinM/Nis the image of the centralizer CM(A) by Lemma 2.1. Therefore
the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1 are inherited by any A-invariant section. We shall freely use
this fact without special references.
3.Sinks of bounded cardinality
First we consider a soluble group Gof Fitting height 2 satisfying the hypotheses of
Theorem 1.1.
Proposition 3.1. LetGbe a ﬁnite group admitting a group of automorphisms Aof order
coprime to |G|.Letmbe a positive integer such that either
(a)every element g∈CG(A)has a left Engel sink EG(g)of cardinality at most m,or
(b)every element g∈CG(A)has a right Engel sink RG(g)of cardinality at most m.
6IfG=F2(G),then the centralizer CG/F(G)(A)ofAinG/F(G)hasm-bounded order .
Proof. To lighten the notation, for the rest of the proof we write F=F(G). By Gasch¨ utz’s
theorem [39, Satz III.4.2] the image of the Fitting subgroup Fin the quotient of Gby
the Frattini subgroup Φ( F) ofFis the Fitting subgroup of the quotient G/Φ(F). Since
|C(G/Φ(F))/(F/Φ(F))(A)|=|CG/F(A)|by Lemma 2.1 and the hypothesis is inherited by the
quotient G/Φ(F) by Remark 2.9, we can assume that Φ( F) = 1. Then Fis a direct product
of minimal normal subgroups of Gby Gasch¨ utz’s theorem [39, Satz III.4.5], and therefore
Fis a direct product of elementary abelian p-groups for various p.
Letqbe any prime dividing |CG/F(A)|, and let Qbe a Sylow q-subgroup of CG/F(A).
Consider any non-trivial element g∈Q, and let ˆ gbe a pre-image of ginCG(A), which
exists by Lemma 2.1. Since the image of the Sylow q-subgroup of /an}bracketle{tˆg/an}bracketri}htinG/Fcontains g,
we can choose ˆ gto be also a q-element.
Then ˆginducesbyconjugationanon-trivialcoprimeautomorphismoftheH allq′-subgroup
Fq′ofF. If we suppose the opposite, that ˆ gcentralizes Fq′, then ˆgcentralizes all factors of a
principal series of G. Indeed, such a series can be chosen to contain Fq′andF. The element
ˆg, being a q-element, centralizes the principal q-factors in F/Fq′; furthermore, ˆ gcentralizes
all factors of this series above F, sinceG/Fis nilpotent by hypothesis. As a result, then ˆ g
would belong to Fby [12, 5.2.9], a contradiction.
Deﬁning the action of g∈QonFq′as induced by the conjugation by an element ˆ gchosen
as above, we obtain a well-deﬁned faithful action of Qby coprime automorphisms on Fq′,
because/an}bracketle{tˆg/an}bracketri}ht ∩Fis contained in the Sylow q-subgroup of Fand therefore centralizes Fq′.
We have [ Fq′,ˆg]⊆E(ˆg)∩R(ˆg) by Lemma 2.8. Hence, under any of the hypotheses (a) or
(b), the subgroup [ Fq′,ˆg] = [Fq′,g] hasm-bounded order for any g∈Q. Then|Q|is also
m-bounded by Lemma 2.2. In particular, the prime qis bounded above in terms of m, so
there are only m-boundedly many primes dividing |CG/F(ϕ)|. Since the order of CG/F(ϕ) is
the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups, each of which ha sm-bounded order, we
obtain that |CG/F(ϕ)|is bounded in terms of m. /square
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Recall that Gis a ﬁnite group admitting a soluble group of automor-
phismsAof order coprime to |G|, andmis a positive integer such that either
(a) every element g∈CG(A) has a left Engel sink EG(g) of cardinality at most m, or
(b) every element g∈CG(A) has a right Engel sink RG(g) of cardinality at most m.
We already know from [15, Proposition 3.2] that the index of the solub le radical |G:S(G)|
is bounded in terms of m. It remains to show that |G:F2α(A)+2(G)|is bounded in terms of
|A|andm. For that, we obviously can assume that the group Gis soluble.
By Theorem 1.5 or 1.6 (in cases (a) or (b), respectively), we obtain t hatCG(A) has
a subgroup of m-bounded order with nilpotent quotient. Therefore the Fitting heig ht of
CG(A) ism-bounded. Applying Thompson’s theorem [3] (or Turull’s [14] improve ment with
best possible bound), we obtain that the Fitting height of Gis (α(A),m)-bounded.
We now apply Proposition 3.1 to every metanilpotent quotient Fi+2(G)/Fi(G) fori=
0,1,2,..., whereF0(G) = 1. By this proposition, |CFi+2(G)/Fi+1(G)(A)|ism-bounded, for ev-
eryi= 0,1,2,.... Since the Fittingheight of Gis (α(A),m)-bounded, in view of Lemma 2.1
we obtain that |CG/F(G)(A)|is (α(A),m)-bounded.
7By the Hartley–Isaacs theorem [5, Theorem A] applied to G/F(G) and its group of
automorphisms induced by A, it followsthat the (2 α(A)+1)-thFittingsubgroup of G/F(G)
has (|A|,m)-bounded index, and therefore the index |G:F2α(A)+2(G)|is also (|A|,m)-
bounded. /square
4.Bounding the rank of the quotient by the soluble radical
A bound for the index of the soluble radical in Theorem 1.1 has been ob tained in [15,
Proposition 3.2] as a corollary of a recent result of R. M. Guralnick an d G. Tracey [40]. The
proof of Theorem 1.2, where we obtain a bound for the rank of the q uotient by the soluble
radical, is similar. First we quote one of the results in [40].
Theorem 4.1 (see [40, Theorem 1.6]) .Letτ∈AutGbe an involutive automorphism of
a ﬁnite group G,and letJ(τ) ={g∈G|ghas odd order and gτ=g−1}.Suppose that
[G,τ] =G.ThenG=/an}bracketle{tJ(τ)/an}bracketri}ht.
Wederive fromTheorem 4.1 a propositionabout groups of coprime au tomorphisms whose
ﬁxed points have Engel sinks of bounded rank in greater generality than Theorem 1.2, as it
may ﬁnd applications in other studies.
Proposition 4.2. LetGbe a ﬁnite group admitting a group of coprime automorphisms H.
Suppose that ris a positive integer such that every 2-element t∈CG(H)has a left or right
Engel sink /an}bracketle{tEG(t)/an}bracketri}htor/an}bracketle{tRG(t)/an}bracketri}htof rank at most r.Then the rank of the quotient G/S(G)by
the soluble radical is r-bounded.
(In the statement, “left or right” is applied individually to the 2-eleme nts ofCG(H), so
that it may be diﬀerent, left or right, Engel sinks for diﬀerent 2-ele ments of CG(H).)
Proof. Since the hypothesis is inherited by G/S(G), we can assume that S(G) = 1. Then
the generalized Fitting subgroup
F∗(G) =T1×···×Tn (4.1)
is a direct product of non-abelian ﬁnite simple groups Ti, which are permuted by H. Since
the centralizer of F∗(G) is trivial, the group Gembeds into the automorphism group of
F∗(G), which is known to be of the form
/parenleftbig
AutT1×···×AutTn/parenrightbig
U, (4.2)
whereUisasubgroupofthesymmetricgroup Sn. Sincetheranksoftheouterautomorphism
groups Aut Ti/Tiare known to be at most 3 (due to the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple gro ups;
see, for example, [41]), it is suﬃcient to obtain a bound in terms of rfor the rank of F∗(G).
Thus, we can simply assume that G=F∗(G).
As proved by Y. M. Wang and Z. M. Chen [13] on the basis of the class iﬁcation of ﬁnite
simple groups, a ﬁnite group admitting a group of coprime automorph isms with ﬁxed-point
subgroup of odd order is soluble. Therefore CG(H) contains involutions. Moreover, we can
choose an involution τ∈CG(H) with non-trivial projections onto each of the factors Tiin
(4.1). Indeed, let {Ti1,...,T ik}be one of the orbits of Hin its permutational action on the
set{T1,...,T n}. Clearly, any non-trivial element of the product Ti1×···×Tikcentralized
8byHmust have non-trivial projections onto each of the factors Tij. There is an involution
in the centralizer of Hin the product Ti1×···×Tik. We now take τ∈CG(H) to be the
product of these involutions over all orbits of H. Thenτ∈CG(H) is an involution with
non-trivial projections onto each of the factors Tiin (4.1). Since each Tiis a non-abelian
simple group, it follows that G=F∗(G) = [G,τ].
Ifg∈J(τ), then [ /an}bracketle{tg/an}bracketri}ht,τ] =/an}bracketle{tg/an}bracketri}ht, sincegτ=g−1andghas odd order. Then /an}bracketle{tg/an}bracketri}ht ⊆
R(τ)∩E(τ) by Lemma 2.8. Therefore, J(τ)⊆ /an}bracketle{tR(τ)/an}bracketri}ht ∩/an}bracketle{tE(τ)/an}bracketri}ht, so that /an}bracketle{tJ(τ)/an}bracketri}hthas rank
at most r. Since [ G,τ] =G, we have G=/an}bracketle{tJ(τ)/an}bracketri}htby Theorem 4.1, which completes the
proof. /square
In our situation, we obtain Theorem 1.2 as the following obvious corolla ry.
Corollary 4.3. LetGbe a ﬁnite group admitting a soluble group of automorphisms Aof
order coprime to |G|.Letrbe a positive integer such that every element g∈CG(A)has a
left or right Engel sink /an}bracketle{tEG(g)/an}bracketri}htor/an}bracketle{tRG(g)/an}bracketri}htof rank at most r.Then the rank of the quotient
G/S(G)by the soluble radical is bounded in terms of r.
5.Sinks of bounded rank in soluble case
In this section we prove Theorem 1.3 about a soluble ﬁnite group Gadmitting a soluble
group of coprime automorphisms Awith restrictions on the ranks of Engel sinks of elements
ofCG(A). First we state one of the results of E. I. Khukhro and V. D. Mazu rov [9] about
ﬁnite groups with automorphisms whose ﬁxed point subgroups have bounded rank.
Theorem 5.1 ([9, Theorem 5.2(c)]) .If a soluble ﬁnite group Gadmits an automorphism
ϕof prime order pcoprime to |G|such that CG(ϕ)has rank r,then the order |G/F4(G)|is
(p,r)-bounded.
While the paper [9] also contained a theorem about a soluble group Aof coprime auto-
morphisms, we derive here essentially the same result with a slightly be tter function.
Corollary 5.2. If a soluble ﬁnite group Gadmits a soluble group of coprime automorphisms
Asuch that CG(A)has rank r,then the order |G/F4α(A)+2α(A)−1|is(|A|,r)-bounded.
Proof. LetA1be a normal subgroup of Aof prime index. The quotient A/A1induces an
automorphism of prime order of the subgroup C1=CG(A1) with centralizer CC1(A/A1) =
CG(A) of rank r. By the Khukhro–Mazurov Theorem 5.1 the order |C1/F4(C1)|is bounded
intermsof |A/A1|andr. OneofthemainresultsofJ. Thompson’s paper [3]statesthatfor a
coprime automorphism ϕ∈AutGof prime order we have the inclusion F(CG(ϕ))/lessorequalslantF4(G).
A repeated application of this theorem with respect to A1yields the inclusion F4(CG(A1))/lessorequalslant
F4·4α(A)−1(G) =F4α(A)(G) (see [9, Corollary 5.6]. Then the order |CG/F4α(A)(G)(A1)|is
bounded in terms of |A/A1|andrby Lemma 2.1(a). By the Hartley–Isaacs theorem [5,
Theorem A] applied to G/F4α(A)(G) and its group of automorphisms induced by A1, it fol-
lows that the index of the (2( α(A1) + 1)-th Fitting subgroup of G/F4α(A)(G) is bounded
in terms of |A1|and|CG/F4α(A)(G)(A1)|, and therefore, by the above, in terms of |A|andr.
Taking into account the equation α(A1) =α(A)−1, we obtain as a result that the index
|G:F4α(A)+2α(A)−1(G)|is (|A|,r)-bounded. /square
9We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.3. We use the standard notat ionOp′(G) for the
largest normal p′-subgroup of G, andOp′,p(G) for the inverse image of the largest normal
p-subgroup of G/Op′(G).
Proof of Theorem 1.3. Recall that Gis a soluble ﬁnite group admitting a soluble group of
coprime automorphisms Asuch that either
(a) every element g∈CG(A) has a left Engel sink /an}bracketle{tEG(g)/an}bracketri}htof rank at most r, or
(b) every element g∈CG(A) has a right Engel sink /an}bracketle{tRG(g)/an}bracketri}htof rank at most r.
We need to prove that the index |G:F4α(A)+4α(A)+3(G)|is bounded in terms of |A|andr,
whereα(A) is the composition length of A.
Fix a prime pdividing |G|. The quotient ¯G=G/Op′,p(G) acts faithfully on the Frattini
quotient VofOp′,p(G)/Op′(G) (see, for example, [42, Theorem 6.3.4]). Let Hbe a Hall
p′-subgroup of CG(A). Forh∈H, we have [ V,h]⊆ /an}bracketle{tEV/angbracketlefth/angbracketright(h)/an}bracketri}ht∩/an}bracketle{tRV/angbracketlefth/angbracketright(h)/an}bracketri}htby Lemma 2.8.
Since the subgroups /an}bracketle{tEV/angbracketlefth/angbracketright(h)/an}bracketri}htand/an}bracketle{tRV/angbracketlefth/angbracketright(h)/an}bracketri}htare images of subgroups of /an}bracketle{tEG(h)/an}bracketri}htand
/an}bracketle{tRG(h)/an}bracketri}ht, respectively, it follows that under any of the above conditions (a) or (b) the rank
of [V,h] is at most rfor anyh∈H. Therefore the image ¯HofHin¯Ghasr-bounded rank
by Lemma 2.5.
Now let tbe any prime dividing |¯G|such that t/ne}ationslash=p. (Note that if there are no such
primest, thenG=Op′,p(G).) The group¯¯G=¯G/Ot′,t(¯G) acts faithfully on the Frattini
quotient WofOt′,t(¯G)/Ot′(¯G). LetKbe a Hall t′-subgroup of CG(A). Fork∈K, we
have [W,k]⊆ /an}bracketle{tEW/angbracketleftk/angbracketright(k)/an}bracketri}ht∩/an}bracketle{tRW/angbracketleftk/angbracketright(k)/an}bracketri}htby Lemma 2.8. Since the subgroups /an}bracketle{tEW/angbracketleftk/angbracketright(k)/an}bracketri}htand
/an}bracketle{tRW/angbracketleftk/angbracketright(k)/an}bracketri}htare images of subgroups of /an}bracketle{tEG(k)/an}bracketri}htand/an}bracketle{tRG(k)/an}bracketri}ht, respectively, it follows that
under any of the above conditions (a) or (b) the rank of [ W,k] is at most rfor anyk∈K.
Therefore the image¯¯KofKin¯¯Ghasr-bounded rank by Lemma 2.5.
Sincep/ne}ationslash=t, for any prime qdividing |CG(A)|there is a Sylow q-subgroup QofCG(A)
that is contained either in the Hall p′-subgroup HofCG(A) or in the Hall t′-subgroup Kof
CG(A). Hence the image¯¯QofQin¯¯Ghasr-bounded rank, since this was proved above for
HandK. By Lemma 2.3 then the image of CG(A) in¯¯Galso has r-bounded rank. Using
Lemma 2.1(a) we obtain that C¯¯G(A) hasr-bounded rank.
By the Khukhro–Mazurov Corollary 5.2 the order |¯¯G/F4α(A)+2α(A)−1(¯¯G)|is bounded in
terms of |A|and the rank of C¯¯G(A), and therefore in terms of |A|andrby the above.
The quotient
¯G/slashBigg/intersectiondisplay
t/negationslash=pOt′,t(¯G) (5.1)
embeds into the direct product of the quotients ¯G/slashbig
Ot′,t(¯G) over the primes t/ne}ationslash=p. Each of
these quotients (denoted by¯¯Gabove for a particular t) is an extension of a normal subgroup
of Fitting height at most 4α(A)+2α(A)−1 by a group of ( |A|,r)-bounded order. Therefore
this direct product, as well as the quotient 5.1, is an extension of a n ormal subgroup of
Fitting height at most 4α(A)+2α(A)−1 by a group of ( |A|,r)-bounded exponent.
SinceOp(¯G) = 1, we have
/intersectiondisplay
t/negationslash=pOt′,t(¯G) =/intersectiondisplay
qOq′,q(¯G) =F(¯G).
10Thus, the quotient 5.1 is equal to ¯G/F(¯G) and is an extension of a normal subgroup of
Fitting height at most 4α(A)+ 2α(A)−1 by a group of ( |A|,r)-bounded exponent. In
other words, the quotient ¯G=G/Op′,p(G) is an extension of a normal subgroup of Fitting
height at most 4α(A)+2α(A) by a group of ( |A|,r)-bounded exponent for any prime p. The
same assertion is also true in the degenerate case, when there are no primes t/ne}ationslash=pdividing
|G/Op′,p(G)|, since then G=Op′,p(G).
SinceF(G) =/intersectiontext
pOp′,p(G), the quotient
G/F(G) =G/slashBigg/intersectiondisplay
pOp′,p(G)
embeds into thedirect product ofthequotients G/Op′,p(G) andthereforeisalso anextension
of a normal subgroup of Fitting height at most 4α(A)+2α(A) by a group of ( |A|,r)-bounded
exponent. Thus, the quotient /tildewideG=G/F4α(A)+2α(A)+1(G) has (|A|,r)-bounded exponent.
Inagroupof( |A|,r)-boundedexponent, asubgroupofrankatmost rhas(|A|,r)-bounded
order by Lemma 2.6. Therefore under condition (a) or (b) the left o r right Engel sinks of
elementsof C/tildewideG(A)have(|A|,r)-boundedorders. ApplyingTheorem1.1to /tildewideGanditsgroupof
automorphisms induced by Awe obtain that the order |/tildewideG/F2α(A)+2(/tildewideG)|is (|A|,r)-bounded.
As a result, the order |G/F4α(A)+4α(A)+3(G)|is (|A|,r)-bounded. /square
