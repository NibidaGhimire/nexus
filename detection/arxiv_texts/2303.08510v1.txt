Abstract
This work deals with matter-wave bright soliton molecules in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates de-
scribed by three-component Gross-Pitaevskii equations with non-autonomous nonlinearities that can
be tuned by Feshbach resonance management. Notably, it portrays the possibility of generating bright
bound soliton molecules with the help of an exact analytic solution under a controlled velocity reso-
nance mechanism. Results show that these soliton molecules experience the e ects of time-varying
nonlinearities and modulate themselves during propagation by keeping their stable properties. Signif-
icantly, the chosen periodic and kink-like nonlinearities expose the snaking, bending, compression,
and ampliÔ¨Åcation of multi-structured soliton molecules along with appreciable changes in their am-
plitude, velocity, width, and oscillations of the molecule proÔ¨Åles. The present results will add signiÔ¨Å-
cant knowledge to a complete understanding beyond the known interaction dynamics of matter-wave
bright solitons in spinor condensates.

1. Introduction
The study of localized nonlinear waves in atomic condensates has become one of the frontier
topics in modern-day research. Especially, the recent experimental discoveries [1‚Äì3] have led to
a tremendous research interest in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Several works in theoretical
and experimental directions on multicomponent BECs demonstrate the existence of di erent types
of nonlinear waves, ranging from bright, gray, dark, and gap solitons to general, Akhmediev and
Kuznetsov-Ma breathers, and rogue waves under various homogeneous and controllable environ-
ments [1]. The realm of multicomponent BECs with optical dipole trap leads to realising the spinor
BECs (see review article [4] and references therein). For a generic hyperÔ¨Åne spin F=1 state, the
spinor solitons in a one-dimensional coupled Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) system have been studied the-
oretically [5‚Äì7] and matter rogue waves have been investigated [8]. Indeed, pertinent experimental
works have shown that the creation of mixed type dark‚Äìbright‚Äìbright and dark‚Äìdark‚Äìbright solitons
and magnetic solitons in spin-1 BECs [9‚Äì13]. Further, the study of BECs with spatially or temporally
varying nonlinearities has emerged as an interesting avenue due to the Feshbach resonance [14], a
mechanism by which the scattering lengths can be tuned. Precisely, the spin-dependent interactions
can be controlled by employing an external optical or microwave Ô¨Åeld in the F=1 spinor condensate
that drives the non-autonomous nonlinearities [15, 16]. By utilizing the above technique, the dynam-
ics of non-autonomous bright matter-wave solitons and interactions depicting soliton ampliÔ¨Åcation
with compression have been explored theoretically using the kink-like modulated nonlinearity [17].
The dynamics of non-autonomous bright-dark solitons and rogue waves have been investigated by
both analytical and numerical methods for di erent temporally modulated nonlinearities [18]. Par-
ticularly, the dynamics of non-autonomous multi-rogue waves in a three-component GP system is
studied and certain interesting features for single, double and triple-hump vector rogue waves are
revealed [19].
Though adequate results on the dynamics of soliton propagation and their interactions are avail-
able, their complete behaviour under various controllable physical settings requires further explo-
ration and continues to be an important aspect of the study. To mention a few signiÔ¨Åcant studies
along this direction are dark‚Äìanti-dark spinor solitons [20, 21], dark-dark soliton breathing patterns
[22], soliton interactions on nonzero background [23], bright-dark solitons [24‚Äì26], and several other
types of nonlinear waves such as breather and rogue waves [27], that are obtained through inverse
scattering transformation, Hirota bilinear procedure, KP-hierarchy reduction method, Darboux and
B¬®acklund transformation techniques, etc. In particular, as a branch of soliton interactions, the nature
of soliton molecule (SM) generation and their dynamics is of current importance in di erent nonlinear
systems arising from optics to hydrodynamics [28, 29]. Soliton molecules are nothing but multiple
composite solitons travelling together with resonance velocity (phase matching), which undergo pe-
riodic attraction and repulsion with remarkable stability during their propagation. The bound states
involving two bright solitons exist when they are brought close to each other but with opposite phases,
where the attractive interaction turns repulsive at a particular separation and a stable equilibrium is
2Ref.: Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 448(2023) 133694 DOI: 10.1016 /j.physd.2023.133694
created and they have been called as soliton molecules due to their ability to restitute their equilibrium
separation [30]. Further, the formation of matter-wave soliton molecules is achieved by a bound pair
of two solitons prepared in phase with a su ciently small separation and relative velocity [31]. One of
the striking features is that the soliton molecules propagate around the equilibrium separation due to
the available nonlinearity, which helps to minimize /avoid standard crossing interactions. In nonlinear
optical systems, it has been achieved by phase-locked Ô¨Åber lasers in dispersion-managed media [32‚Äì
37]. Molecules can be generated in di erent ways and one of the signiÔ¨Åcant routes to achieve them is
by controlling the parameters of optical /matter-wave solitons [32‚Äì39]. Such questions naturally arise
here to understand molecules in bosonic condensates, which are not yet studied for multicomponent
BECs in general and for spinor BECs in particular.
Motivated by the above interesting observations and for further understanding, we devote our
objective to studying the dynamics of bright matter-wave SMs in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates
with di erent forms of modulated nonlinearities. First, we provide certain essential descriptions of the
non-autonomous spinor model under consideration in the next section 2 along with the methodology
used for the present study. Section 3 contains a brief revisit on the soliton dynamics in the underlying
autonomous system. A categorical analysis of the generation of spinor matter-wave bright SMs with
explicit solutions and their dynamics under modulation by non-autonomous nonlinearities is given in
section 4. The Ô¨Ånal section 5 is allotted for conclusions along with certain future directions.
2. The Mathematical Model and Method
We consider the following three-component non-autonomous Gross-Pitaevskii (3-NAGP) equa-
tions describing the dynamics of an ultra-cold dilute gas of optically trapped spin F=1 bosonic
condensates [1‚Äì5]:

where 1;0denote wave functions of the three spin components with spin projection mF=1;0,tand
xare time and spatial co-ordinates, and Vext(x;t) represents an external trapping potential which can
be chosen among di erent forms like harmonic, double-well, optical lattice potential, etc. [40‚Äì42].
Here the mean-Ô¨Åeld (spin-independent) interaction c0(t)=2(a0(t)+2a2(t))=3 and the spin-dependent
interaction c2(t)=2(a2(t) a0(t))=3 arise as function of time-varying s-wave scattering lengths a0(t)
anda2(t) that can be tuned by Feshbach resonance mechanism [3]. The above 3-NAGP equation
3Ref.: Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 448(2023) 133694 DOI: 10.1016 /j.physd.2023.133694
is generally non-integrable, but its constant-nonlinearity counterparts become integrable for certain
special choices of mean-Ô¨Åeld and the spin-dependent interactions c0=c2=candc2=0 [43]. Here
the former choice includes the contribution of spin-mixing nonlinearities, while it is absent in the latter
and reduces to the standard Manakov /coupled GP type equation [44]. The nonlinearity coe cient c
can be either a positive or negative real constant representing repulsive or attractive spinor condensates
for which soliton solutions and their dynamics are reported without the external potential [5, 43]. As
our focus is to study soliton molecules using the exact solution of the considered non-autonomous
spinor BEC model, we choose both mean-Ô¨Åeld and spin-exchange interaction coupling coe cients
c0(t) and c2(t) (which depend on the s-wave scattering lengths a0(t) and a2(t)) to be equal, i.e., c0(t)=
c2(t)=c(t) based on the mentioned integrability choice along with the similarity transformation result
in homogeneous spinor system (without potential). Due to this speciÔ¨Åc consideration, the role of
miscible and immiscible behaviour does not play any important role in the present study dealing with
the dynamics of solitons with an explicit solution. The above model has its equivalent counterparts in
optical systems with /without coherent four-wave mixing e ects in addition to self- and cross-phase
modulation nonlinearities [45‚Äì52].
Now, we consider the following constant-coe cient (autonomous) three-coupled Gross-Pitaevskii
(3-GP) equations [5, 17, 43, 53]:

The above-mentioned solution (3) is a phase-locked solution as all three components possess the same
phase, which has a quadratic dependence on x. Note that for constant nonlinearity coe cient c, the
phasehas a linear dependence on xandt. The constraint condition (3e) is nothing but the Riccati
equation and it determines the relationship between the external potential Vext(x;t) and nonlinearity
c(t). The above transformation contains two arbitrary (similarity) parameters 1and2that will play
an important role in the dynamics of the associated nonlinear wave. Through the above transforma-
tions, one can analyze the dynamics of any type of nonlinear waves, localized or travelling, associated
with the non-autonomous model (1), once we know the solutions of its autonomous counterpart (2).
Thus, in the following sections, we can study the impact of non-autonomous nonlinearities in the
formation and evolution of bound SMs of the 3-NAGP system (1) by using the transformation (3).
Here it is important to mention that the above similarity transformation (3) has certain limitations
as it cannot be applied to all types of nonlinear evolution equations (PDEs) due to the occurrence of
a number of constraints which hinder the process of getting more general solutions. In the present
work, we have the Riccati type equation (3e) as the restriction during the solution process, which
determines the form of corresponding potential based on the chosen nonlinearity coe cient. Though
this Riccati equation is more physical, we can still say that it is an unavoidable limitation in the present
similarity transformation. Further, the constructed similarity transformation (3) cannot be applied
straightforwardly (as it is) to other nonlinear equations (especially the present spin-1 model (1)) with
both spatio-temporal-dependent nonlinearities (i.e., c(x;t)) and pure spatial-dependent nonlinearities
(c(x)). These problems require further tailoring in the transformation to every model equation, which
can help us to obtain explicit solutions of our interest.
Beyond the above limitations, the present similarity transformation has certain advantages that
add signiÔ¨Åcant novelty to the work, as listed below. (i) The generalized similarity transformation to
the three-component spin-1 BEC system by incorporating physically interesting nonlinearity modu-
lations is new compared with similar approaches in other (scalar and two-coupled) models. (ii) A
more general nonlinearity variation is considered in the form of the Jacobi elliptic function, which en-
compasses the trignometric and hyperbolic type nonlinearity variations. Such modulation dynamics
can be physically realized in an optical lattice potential trap. (iii) Success in similarity transformation
is the achievement of required solutions with less number of constraints. Fortunately, in the present
work, we have achieved with single constraint only, which also becomes the physically signiÔ¨Åcant
Riccati equation.
3. Bright Matter-Wave Solitons: Revisit
As mentioned in the introduction, we can understand that the exact soliton solutions of both 3-
NAGP and 3-GP models have been obtained by using di erent methods along with a detailed discus-
5Ref.: Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 448(2023) 133694 DOI: 10.1016 /j.physd.2023.133694
sion on their propagation and interaction dynamics [5, 17, 53]. Though we intend to deal with SMs
alone, it is essential to emphasize certain entities of fundamental solitons associated with the consid-
ered spinor BEC system. To facilitate the understanding of the formation of SM and for completeness,
we brieÔ¨Çy revisit the nature of solitons arising in the integrable autonomous 3-GP equations using the
previous results. By adopting the non-standard Hirota‚Äôs bilinearization method [17, 53‚Äì55], we can
write the matter-wave bright one-soliton solution for the autonomous 3-GP equation (2) in its explicit
form as below.

Solitons derived from the above solution can be classiÔ¨Åed into ferromagnetic soliton (FS: non-
zero total spin) and polar soliton (PS: zero total spin). These PS and FS arise for the choice S,
0 and S=0, respectively, where the auxiliary function S=   1e21[5, 17, 53]. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the
contribution resulting from the spin-mixing nonlinearity vanishes (  1=0) in the case of FSs and
results in a certain non-zero value of total spin. Its explicit solution becomes a standard vector soliton
with a symmetric sech (bell) type proÔ¨Åle with the same /equal or distinct /non-equal amplitude among
the three components. On the other hand, the presence of spin-mixing nonlinearity makes the total
spin vanish and generates PSs admitting complex solution form and various types of proÔ¨Åles starting
from symmetric single-hump, double-hump, Ô¨Çat-top to asymmetric single /double-hump structures

behaviour for bright FSs and PSs in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. For a more detailed mathematical and physical
interpretations, one can refer to [5, 17]. Here, we have to note that apart from the shape /nature of

Importantly, the direction of soliton propagation becomes right-moving when k1I>0 (left-moving
when k1I<0) with appropriate speed given by the magnitude of jk1Ij. This velocity parameter will
play a pivotal role in the formation of bound SMs, which is the main objective of the manuscript, and
its detailed discussion is given in the next section.
4. Bright Matter-Wave Soliton Molecules
In order to understand the dynamics of bound SMs of any nonlinear dynamical system analytically,
its exact multi-soliton solutions or at least two soliton solution is required. This section discusses the
fundamental SMs comprising two bright matter-wave solitons and explores their dynamics for both
autonomous and non-autonomous spinor systems. For this purpose, we consider the matter-wave
7Ref.: Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 448(2023) 133694 DOI: 10.1016 /j.physd.2023.133694
bright two-soliton solution obtained by the present authors [17, 53] for 3-NAGP model (1) and using
the above-discussed similarity transformation (3) in its explicit form as below.

2resulting in a combined contribution
of both solitons due to spin-mixing nonlinearity. As discussed for the bright one-soliton case in
the previous section, the present two-soliton can also be classiÔ¨Åed into FS and PS with respect to
the total density using spin-mixing nonlinearity (auxiliary function) contributions [5, 17]. Note that
the FSs admit symmetric single-hump proÔ¨Åles alone, while the PSs can have both symmetric and
asymmetric type single-hump /double-hump /Ô¨Çat-top structures for a proper set of parameters. Further,
the interaction among two solitons falls under di erent categories, such as (i) FS with FS, (ii) PS with
PS, and (iii) FS with PS, thereby resulting in various interaction behaviours that include (i) elastic and
spin-precession interactions of single-hump solitons, (ii) elastic interactions of symmetric double-
hump /Ô¨Çat-top and asymmetric single-hump solitons, and (iii) spin-switching interaction of single-
hump /double-hump /Ô¨Çat-top PS leaving the symmetric single-hump soliton unaltered. We refrain from
providing these interaction dynamics here and one can refer to [17] for a detailed discussion on the
solitons in both autonomous and non-autonomous 3-GP systems (2) and (1).
Here, our focus is to analyze every possibility to generate bright SM and unravel various dynami-
cal features resulting from e ective manipulation of the underlying solitons in both autonomous and
non-autonomous settings. From the one-soliton solution, we notice the importance of ku=kuR+ikuI
(u=1;2), where the real part of the parameter ( kuR) takes part in deÔ¨Åning the amplitude of the pro-
Ô¨Åle and the imaginary part ( kuI) controls the velocity of the constituent soliton. Note that this kuI
parameter not only inÔ¨Çuences the velocity and nature of the interaction (whether it is a head-on or
oblique /overtaking interaction) but also accounts for the formation of the molecule. To be speciÔ¨Åc,
the possibility of identifying SMs mainly depends upon the velocity-matching or velocity-resonance
property of constituent solitons with a minimum of two fundamental solitons. However, there can
exist any number of solitons which shall produce multi-soliton molecules. This represents that when
solitons are propagating in a media with the same velocity, they start moving together with mutual and
continuous interactions leading to periodic attraction and repulsion lasting throughout the propagation
distance. Such bound propagation of solitons is referred to as coalescence of wavenumbers due to the

Explicit graphical representations of interactions and molecules are given in Fig. 4.
constraint on the parameter ku. Further, one can also generate both stationary SMs and travelling SMs
by choosing the associated velocity parameters to be zero and non-zero (either positive or negative
constant), respectively, denoted as k1I=k2I=k3I==knI=0 and k1I=k2I=k3I==knI,0
with arbitrary nnumber of solitons. For easy understanding, a schematic representation of the role
ofk1Iandk2Iparameters in the interactions and molecule formation involving two bright solitons are
shown in Figs. 3 and 4.
Additionally, these bright bound SMs can be classiÔ¨Åed into two types based on the central po-
sitions of participating solitons, namely molecules with (i) the same and (ii) distinct central po-
sitions deÔ¨Åned by the kjRparameters. The former results in coinciding or overlapped solitons for
k1R=k2R=k3R==knR,0, where all the available solitons merge together and form a single-
soliton-like structure with superior (higher) amplitude and stable proÔ¨Åle. However, the latter admits
non-coinciding or displaced solitons for the choice k1R,k2R,k3R,,knR,0, which leads to
the bounded propagation of these multiple solitons with di erent central positions and they exhibits
periodic oscillations in their amplitudes.
In the present spinor 3GP system, we formulate two-soliton molecule through a velocity resonance
k1I=k2Iwith same ( k1R=k2R) or di erent ( k1R,k2R) central positions. Particularly, we deal
with molecules formed under di erent pairs of bright solitons, namely (i) FS FS)Ferromagnetic

with coinciding and non-coinciding central positions in the autonomous (2) and non-autonomous
(1) systems showing di erent characteristics due to diverse proÔ¨Åle structures. For bringing out their
salient features, we study these molecules and their dynamics with constant and temporally-varying
nonlinearities for each of these cases in detail.
4.1.Ferromagnetic Soliton Molecule (FSM)
We can obtain ferromagnetic type two-soliton molecules when the spin-mixing nonlinearity van-
ishes. In Refs. [17, 53], it is shown that the FSs admit elastic and spin-precession interactions which
results for the choice  3=0 and  3,0, respectively along with  1=   2=0. Here also, we can
form molecules under these two situations as we discussed below. To understand the facts clearly, we
write the explicit expression for G(j)andFrepresenting FSM with two bright solitons, resulting for
the choice  1=   2=0 and k2I=k1Iby keeping central positions distinct with k1R,k2R, due to which
several terms vanish and takes a simple form as given below.

The autonomous FSM is now characterized by four (out of six) spin-polarization parameters (j)

and three arbitrary real constants k1R;k2Randk1I. By analyzing the above form, we can observe
that the localized FSM admits oscillation in its amplitude along with periodic attraction and repulsion
in localization due to the simultaneous existence of hyperbolic and trigonometric functions. It is
essential to note the signiÔ¨Åcance of bound molecules compared to that interacting solitons. During an
elastic interaction, one can obtain single-maximum /peak amplitude at the one-time interaction regime,
after which both solitons pass through each other and regain their initial identities except for a phase
shift. However, in molecules, both solitons interact periodically without passing through each other
and it continues indeÔ¨Ånitely by generating a peak /maxima at every interaction. This is driven by the
third periodic term appearing in the denominator of Eq. (6c), which becomes a pure cosine function
along Talone with periodicity proportional to k2
1R k2
2R. Thus, based on the magnitude k2
1R k2
2R,
which represents the di erence in the central positions between the two participating solitons, we can
control the period of oscillations and induce asymmetry between the two oscillating proÔ¨Åles. Suppose
if we choose the same central position by taking k2R=k1R, we can eliminate these oscillations as the
term with periodic functions vanishes completely, as the present choice makes 2=1and hence the
corresponding simpliÔ¨Åed solution structure can be reduced from (6a)-(6c) as given below.

one-soliton solution (4) and reveals the expected merger of two solitons into a stable propagation of
a one-soliton-like structure. However, when the central positions are di erent, the above form will
be invalid and turns more complex version (6c) as k1R,k2Rand2,1. Thus the resulting solution
admits di erent proÔ¨Åles, from single-hump to double-hump proÔ¨Åles across all three components.
Additionally, the SMs exhibit breathing along the amplitude and propagation with the periodicity of
oscillations proportional to k2

In order to highlight the above discussion, we have graphically depicted the evolution of degener-
ate and symmetric FSs in Fig. 5. First, we have shown their standard elastic type head-on interaction
11Ref.: Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 448(2023) 133694 DOI: 10.1016 /j.physd.2023.133694
due to opposite velocities ( k1I= k2I=0:5) in Fig. 5(a) and how they can be transformed to a
moving /travelling FSM for equal-velocities (velocity resonance) k1I=k2I=0:5 in Fig. 5(b). Also, we
have shown the stationary FSM having zero-velocity k1I=k2I=0:0 with non-coinciding central po-
sitions resulting in breathing propagation in Fig. 5(c). Finally, in Fig. 5(d), the soliton molecule with
coinciding centers showcasing the stable single-soliton-like pattern is given. We can observe that the
amplitude of the periodically appearing excited peaks is much higher than that of individual /merged
solitons.

On the other hand, the non-autonomous FSMs are governed by two real constants 1and2along
with the crucial arbitrary nonlinearity function c(t) in addition to the arbitrary parameters (j)
u,k1R;k2R
andk1I. Mainly, the localized structure of FSM experiences modulations driven by the nonlinearity
c(t) and can be chosen among diverse possibilities. Every form of adopted c(t) decides the exter-
nal potential suitably through the condition (3e). Additionally, change in the velocity /orientation
of molecule is described by the combined contribution from c(t),1and2, while its amplitude is
decided by c(t) and1alone that we can understand from the similarity relations given in section
3. To demonstrate the above features, we consider the following simple Jacobi elliptic function for
12Ref.: Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 448(2023) 133694 DOI: 10.1016 /j.physd.2023.133694
non-autonomous nonlinearity:
c(t)=p1+p2sn(p3t+p4;m);0m1; (8)
where pj;j=1;2;3;4;are arbitrary real constants and mis the elliptic modulus parameter. The
above form of c(t) encompasses two types of modulated nonlinearities namely periodic (sine) and
kink-like (tanh) e ects with respect to tfor two extreme values of elliptic modulus parameter, m=0
andm=1, respectively. Also, we can choose constant nonlinearity with magnitude p1forp2=0. We
have shown the nature of the above nonlinearity and the associated potential in Fig. 6. Apart from the
above simple form of nonlinearity (8), one can proceed with several other forms and their superposed
forms with appropriately deÔ¨Åned external potentials.
Figure 6: Nature of two forms of nonlinearities c(t) (left) representing a periodic ( m=0) and kink-like ( m=1) behaviour
forp1=2:0,p2=0:75,p3=0:5 and p4=0:0 in Eq. (8). The associated form of trapping potentials Vext(x;t) are given
in the right panel.
The above-considered periodic and localized-kink-like non-autonomous nonlinearities are Ô¨Åxed
by taking m=0 and m=1 in Eq. (8), respectively, impacting the dynamics of observed FSM. Espe-
cially, the former sinusoidal nonlinearity induces a periodically oscillating (snaking) pattern for FSM,
where the already breathing structure undergoes further oscillations in both amplitude and position.
Also, it increases the asymmetry between the two breathing solitons and the period of oscillations.
As pointed out already, the localization and velocity of the molecule can be manipulated by 1and2.
Next, due to a tan-hyperbolic nonlinearity function, the breathing molecule executes an ampliÔ¨Åcation
associated with compression and increased periodic oscillations. Simply, we can observe a step-like
operation where the amplitude and period of breathing oscillations are less before the step function.
However, after implementing step nonlinearity, the amplitude and period of breathing oscillations
undergo a step increase, which reduces the width of the breathing molecule and is nothing but a com-
pression. Further, the period of oscillation of the soliton chain or molecule is increasing due to this
kink/step-like nonlinearity modulation, which developed more number of breathing chains /patterns.
Another noticeable e ect is the bending of the soliton molecule. This is a consequence of the varying
velocity of the molecule around the interaction regime ( x=t=0) due to the inhomogeneity of the

nied with compression and bending due to kink-like nonlinearity (bottom panel). The parameters are chosen as 1=0:52,

nonlinearity. Ultimately, this inÔ¨Çuences the width and central position of the soliton molecule. The
sense of bending can be altered by varying the 1and2parameters as evidenced from Fig. 7. For an
easy understanding of the above phenomena, we have shown the respective graphical demonstration
for a periodic oscillation and ampliÔ¨Åcation /compression of an initial stationary FSM in Fig. 7. Here,
we can Ô¨Ånd that the stationary (zero-velocity) nature of the molecule is now transformed into a mov-
ing bound structure due to the controllable similarity variables 1and2. Also, one can consider a
travelling molecule and study the modulational characteristics of non-autonomous nonlinearities.
The above-discussed dynamics correspond to a degenerate type FSM ( jQ1j=jQ2j=jQ3j). How-
ever, we can also have another possibility of non-degenerate FSM formed out from two bright soli-
tons with distinct densities in each component ( jQ1j,jQ2j,jQ3j) by choosing the parameters
(1)
u,(2)
u,(3)
u,u=1;2. This choice, along with di erent velocities, usually results in an in-
elastic (spin-precession) type interaction of two solitons as it leads to  1=   2=0 but  3,0. We
have shown such inelastic interaction of two non-degenerate FSs travelling with opposite velocities
(k1I>0>k2I) in the top panel of Fig. 8 (for an easy reference). Interestingly, during molecule for-
mation, they execute parallel-type propagation for coinciding central positions due to non-degenerate
peaks instead of single-peak-soliton. Further, we have demonstrated its transformation into a station-

ary molecule with a breathing pattern through the velocity matching ( k1I=0=k2I) in the second row
of Fig. 8. The inÔ¨Çuence of non-autonomous (periodic and kink-like) nonlinearities in the third and
fourth rows of Fig. 8 demonstrates the asymmetric oscillation and ampliÔ¨Åcation-cum-compression of
FSM.
4.2.Polar Soliton Molecule (PSM)
Next, the polar soliton molecule (PSM) can be formed from the interaction solution of two PSs.
To be precise, the general two-soliton solution (5b) and (5a) correspond to autonomous and non-
autonomous PSs without any restriction on spin polarization parameters (j)
u;u=1;2;j=1;2;3;
that can take arbitrary complex values and keep  j,0;j=1;2;3. In this case, every term arising in
the general solution (given in the Appendix) becomes non-vanishing and contributes to the dynamics
of PSs and thereby, PSM can be constructed with velocity resonance condition. Due to the presence
of every term in the PSM, it is di cult to write the explicit form of such PSM for non-coinciding
central positions k1R,k2Rin a compact manner. However, for a special case with coinciding central
position k1R=k2R, we can rewrite the PSM in terms of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions as
below.

with k2=k1and other relations takes the form as given in Eq. (3) and in Appendix A.
The above PSM solution is nothing but two identical PSs ( 2=1) driven by six spin-polarization
parameters (j)
u;u=1;2;j=1;2;3. As mentioned earlier, each PSs can feature various proÔ¨Åles
starting from single-hump to double-hump and Ô¨Çat-top structure with di erent intermediate forms of
symmetric and asymmetric nature. They result in an elastic interaction alone without any possibility
for condensate density sharing, and one can refer [17] for a detailed asymptotic analysis explaining
the interaction. From the multi-proÔ¨Åle nature of PSs, we can generate PSM by the known phase-
matching condition, which leads to the bounded periodic attractive-repulsive wave pattern with a
mixture of di erent proÔ¨Åles. For example, the molecule formed from a single-hump and double-
hump PSs admits bounded propagation of three-hump oscillating breathers. Similarly, other possible
PS structures also produce appropriate stationary or moving bound molecules. Further, the non-
autonomous nonlinearity modulates the amplitude, width, and velocity of these PSM as explained
previously for the FSM case. For completeness, we have depicted the elastic interaction of Ô¨Çat-top
and double-hump (single-hump and asymmetric double-hump) PSs in Q2(Q1andQ3) component(s)
in the top row of Fig. 9, where each PS experiences only a phase-shift after the interaction. However,

their transition due to velocity-locking generates PSM with the multi-hump stationary structure for
k1I=k2I=0 as shown in the second row of Fig. 9, while this PSM can become a moving pattern for
k1I=k2I,0 (not shown here). The periodic and kink-like nonlinearity-induced multi-hump PSMs
are also shown in the third and fourth rows of Fig. 9 with a transition from stationary to a left-moving
molecule by tuning 2= 0:21. One can also tune the (u)
jparameters in the other way to create PSM
from diverse combinations of PSs.
4.3.Mixed Ferromagnetic-Polar Soliton Molecule (FPSM)
The previous two cases deal with the dynamics of PSM and FSM generated from the pure state of
two PSs or two FSs, respectively, where the former possesses the inÔ¨Çuence of spin-mixing nonlinear-
ity and the latter does not have its role. The third branch of the two-soliton-pair can be constructed
with a combination of both FS and PS, which can be attained either for  1=0 and  2,0 giving FS S1
and PS S2or alternately  1,0 and  2=0 giving PS S1and FS S2. However, for both possibilities,

A careful analysis of the interaction behaviour shows that the PS undergoes inelastic (spin-mixing)
interaction leaving the FS unaltered along all the components, and both solitons exhibit an additional
phase-shift. Particularly, during such spin-mixing interaction, PS can change its proÔ¨Åle nature from
single-hump /Ô¨Çat-top to symmetric /asymmetric double-hump or vice-versa, which can be tuned by us-
ing the(j)
uparameters. Detailed asymptotic analysis describing such FS PS interaction is provided
in Ref. [17]. Now, we focus on the mixed FPSM obtained for the already identiÔ¨Åed choice of ve-
locity resonance k2I=k1Iand thereby the resulting FPSM provides stationary or travelling patterns
possessing various combinations of proÔ¨Åle structures based on the selection of (j)
u,k1R,k2Randk1I
parameters. We have shown the spin-switching interaction of PS ( S2) with FS ( S1) in the top panels
of Fig. 10. The left-moving PS ( S2) has an asymmetric (symmetric) double-hump proÔ¨Åle in Q1;3(Q2)
components and switches to a single-hump (Ô¨Çat-top) proÔ¨Åle with suppression (enhancement) appro-
priately conserving the total density of molecules. However, as predicted, the right-moving FS ( S1)
undergoes elastic interaction in all three components. The second panel shows the stationary FPSM
and the temporal dependence of nonlinearity c(t) does not break the molecule similar to the previous
cases. During the molecule formation, these solitons do not pass through each other, except for peri-
odic head-on (touching or kissing) interactions. Additionally, the dynamics of these FPSMs can also
be manipulated accordingly using the presence of arbitrary temporally-varying nonlinearities c(t) and
similarity parameters 1and2. The nature of the bound FPSM structure gets altered according to the
periodic and kink-like nonlinearities as given in the previous two cases with di erent proÔ¨Åle patterns.
For completeness, we have shown the corresponding modulated FPSMs in the third and fourth panels
of Fig. 10. One can observe these switching interactions in several other possibilities by suitably
playing with the spin-polarization parameters (j)
u,u=1;2;j=1;2;3.
Considering the length of the manuscript, we have investigated only two types of temporally
varying nonlinearity modulations (periodic and kink-like variation driven by snoidal function). One
can extend the analysis further by explaining with respect to various other types of modulations and
corresponding dynamics of soliton molecules. The proÔ¨Åle-preserving nature of these stationary spinor
bright bound SMs indicates their stable propagation characteristics. However, its dynamics under
interaction with another soliton or molecule require a dedicated analysis and can be considered for
future investigation. Additionally, exploring the stability of SMs using numerical analysis will also
be of an immediate objective. Beyond these simple matter-wave soliton molecules (FSM, PSM and
FPSM) containing only two solitons, it is of our natural interest to extend the analysis by incorporating
multiple bright, dark, and mixed bright-dark solitons as well as their evolution under autonomous and
non-autonomous settings.

5. Conclusions
In this work, we have considered a set of three-coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations describing the
dynamics of spinor F=1 Bose-Einstein condensates with non-autonomous nonlinearities that can
be controlled by the Feshbach mechanism. By using the exact soliton solutions, we have studied the
possibility of generating matter-wave bright soliton molecules (SMs) through the velocity resonance
mechanism and explored their dynamics in detail. Especially the obtained SMs are classiÔ¨Åed based on
the nature of participating soliton as ferromagnetic soliton molecules (FSM), polar soliton molecules
(PSM), and mixed ferromagnetic-polar soliton molecules (FPSM). Their characteristics and the role
of time-varying nonlinearities in each of these classes of molecules are investigated. These bound
soliton molecules modulate themselves during propagation by keeping their stable properties. Partic-
ularly, the modulation of spinor SMs under periodic and kink-like nonlinearities revealed the snaking
and single-step compressed ampliÔ¨Åcation of multi-structured breathing patterns along with apprecia-
ble changes in their amplitude, velocity, width and period of oscillations without breaking the bound
structure. The presented results are signiÔ¨Åcant as they go beyond the known interaction dynamics of
matter-wave bright solitons in spinor condensates. In particular, the interesting soliton molecule bend-
ing can have immediate applications in atomic /optical switching devices and their optical counterpart
in communication. The reason for this is without the loss of energy, the track of the optical pulse
can be altered and even it can be ampliÔ¨Åed through the energy-sharing process among the di erent
modes in the case of multimode propagation. Beyond the above, one can focus to study the dynamics
of dark-dark and bright-dark multi-soliton molecules in spinor BECs and the interaction of molecules
with individual solitons as an immediate future assignment to get more impetus into the inÔ¨Çuence of
inhomogeneities in the system. Such studies will have ramiÔ¨Åcations in multimode graded-index Ô¨Åbers
in addition to atomic condensates.
