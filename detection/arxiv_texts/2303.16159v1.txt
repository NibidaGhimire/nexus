CHECKERBOARD-TYPE
WOLF-PATRICK D ¨ULL, DOMINIK ENGL, AND CAROLIN KREISBECK
Abstract. The main result of this work is a homogenization theorem via v ariational convergence for
elastic materials with stiﬀ checkerboard-type heterogene ities under the assumptions of physical growth
and non-self-interpenetration. While the obtained energy estimates are rather standard, determining the
eﬀective deformation behavior, or in other words, characte rizing the weak Sobolev limits of deformation
maps whose gradients are locally close to rotations on the st iﬀ components, is the challenging part. To
this end, we establish an asymptotic rigidity result, showi ng that, under suitable scaling assumptions,
the attainable macroscopic deformations are aﬃne conforma l contractions. This identiﬁes the composite
as a mechanical metamaterial with a negative Poisson’s rati o. Our proof strategy is to tackle ﬁrst an
idealized model with full rigidity on the stiﬀ tiles to acqui re insight into the mechanics of the model
and then transfer the ﬁndings and methodology to the model wi th diverging elastic constants. The
latter requires, in particular, a new quantitative geometr ic rigidity estimate for non-connected squares
touching each other at their vertices and a tailored Poincar ´ e type inequality for checkerboard structures.

1.Introduction
When speaking of metamaterials, one usually refers to engineered a nd artiﬁcially fabricated materials
tailored to show speciﬁc desirable properties that are rare to ﬁnd n aturally. Among the many diﬀerent
types of metamaterials are electrical, magnetic, acoustic, and mec hanical. We focus here on the latter,
speciﬁcally on those characterized by a negative Poisson’s ratio, me aning a positive ratio of transversal
and axial strains, which are called auxetic. In contrast to standar d materials, like a piece of rubber, they
respond to stretching in uniaxial direction by thickening in the direct ion orthogonal to the applied force.
Among the special characteristics of auxetics are enhanced shea r moduli, increased fracture resistance,
and higher shock absorption capacity, which renders them beneﬁc ial for numerous industrial applications.
Even though the roots of auxetics are reported to date back alre ady to the 1920s [ 48], the topic started
to attract increased attention in the materials science and enginee ring communities only decades later,
when Lakes [ 40] was the ﬁrst to manufacture foams with negative Poisson’s ratio in 1987. Several
mechanisms have since been presented in the literature that give ris e to auxetic material behavior, for
instance, re-entrant honeycomb or bow tie structures in [ 26] (where also the term ’auxetic’ from the
ancient Greek word for ’stretchable’ was coined), multiscale laminat es in [43] and, most relevant for
this work, rotating rigid squares connected by hinges at the vertic es, as introduced in [ 32] by Grima &
Evans. Also other rigid building blocks, such as triangles [ 31,33] or rectangles [ 30,34,35], have been
used by these (and other co-) authors to produce a negative Pois son’s ratio. More recently, there are
thrusts of combing several geometric arrangements at the micro scale to design state-of-the-art materials
with unique characteristics [ 23,44]. For more on the subject, we refer to the review article [ 29] and the
references therein. Compared with the research activities in the m echanics disciplines, the coverage of
auxetic structures from the standpoint of mathematics seems ra ther sporadic. The works by Borcea &
Streinu, e.g., [ 6,7], approach the problem by recoursing to algebraic geometry. They investigate what
crystalline and artiﬁcial structures give rise to auxetic behavior an d devise design principles, based on
their earlier graph-theoretical papers on the deformation of per iodic frameworks with rigid edges [ 5].

posites with diﬀerently sized stiﬀ squares (colored in gray).
This paper contributesto the mathematical theory ofauxetic met amaterials, approachingthe problem
from a new perspective, namely that of asymptotic variational ana lysis. We study a class of composites
in a two-dimensional setting of nonlinear elasticity that show a small-s cale pattern of stiﬀ and soft
tiles arranged into a checkerboard structure as illustrated in Figur e1(cf. also [ 32,38]). Working with
a variational model (detailed in Section 1.1below), the task is to rigorously determine the eﬀective
material behavior and, in particular, characterize the attainable m acroscopic deformations along with
theirenergeticcost. Tothisend, weresorttohomogenizationviaΓ -convergence(forageneralintroduction
to Γ-convergence, see [ 10,19]). Our main result (Theorem 1.1) is a homogenization result that is non-
standard compared to classical papers like [ 9,45] and the works on high-contrast media [ 13,14,21,22].
Instead, it can be interpreted in the context of asymptotic rigidity statements for other reinforcing
elements like layers [ 15,16,20] and ﬁbers [ 25]. This means, generally speaking, that the models are
governed by an interesting interplay between the speciﬁc geometr ic pattern of the heterogeneities and
a strong contrast in the elasticity constants, which leads to global eﬀects and overall, to a strongly
restricted macroscopicmaterial response. For the checkerboa rdcomposites under consideration, we prove
in a suitable scaling regime between the stiﬀness and length scale para meters that the macroscopic
deformations are given by aﬃne maps describing conformal contra ction, conﬁrming a negative Poisson’s
ratio. Since the identiﬁed eﬀective behavior coincides with that of an idealized version of the model with
fully rigid elasticity ofthe stiﬀ components (Theorem 2.5), one may alsoview our main theorem as part of
arobustnessanalysis, whichis signiﬁcantwith aview tothe practical applicabilityofthese metamaterials.
As a closely related issue relevant for the manufacturing process, which is, however, beyond the scope of
this work, is a solid understanding of the sensitivity of imperfections and perturbations in the geometry
of the small-scale structures. Further interesting research dire ctions, which we plan to address in future
work, include the study of metamaterial with rotating triangle stru ctures and the optimal design of the
stiﬀ components.
1.1.Setup of the problem. Let Ω⊂R2be a bounded Lipschitz domain that models the reference
conﬁguration of a two-dimensional elastic body. Deformations of t hat body are described by maps
u: Ω→R2, which - unless mentioned otherwise - are taken to lie in W1,p(Ω;R2) withp >2, and
are thus, in particular, continuous by Sobolev embedding; note tha t some of our results also extend to
p= 2. We generally require our deformations to be orientation preser ving, meaning with positive Jacobi-
determinant almost everywhere, and forbid self-interpenetratio n of matter by imposing the Ciarlet-Neˇ cas
condition [ 17],
/integraldisplay
Ω|det∇u|dx≤ |u(Ω)|, (CN)
which corresponds to injectivity of ua.e. in Ω; for more on the topic of global invertibility of Sobolev
maps, we refer, for instance, to the classical works [ 4,46] or to [8,37,39] for some recent developments.
With these assumptions, we introduce the class of admissible deform ations as
A={u∈W1,p(Ω;R2) : det∇u>0 a.e. on Ω and usatisﬁes ( CN)}. (1.1)A VARIATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON AUXETIC METAMATERIALS 3

conﬁguration Ω with its stiﬀ components Ω ∩εYstiﬀmarked in gray.
Next, we formalize the geometry of the material heterogeneities, arranged in a checkerboard-like
fashion. To this end, the periodicity cell Y= (0,1]2is subdivided into four tiles, precisely,
Y1= (0,λ]2, Y2= (0,λ]×(λ,1], Y3= (λ,1]2, Y4= (λ,1]×(0,λ] (1.2)
for a given parameter λ∈(0,1), and we deﬁne
Ystiﬀ=Y1∪Y3andYsoft=Y2∪Y4,
so thatY=Ystiﬀ∪Ysoft. Note that, without further mentioning, the sets Ystiﬀ,Ysoft,Y1,...,Y 4will also
be identiﬁed throughout with its Y-periodic extensions. The stiﬀ and soft components of the elastic b ody
forming a periodic pattern at length scale ε>0 are then described by the intersection of Ω with εYstiﬀ
andεYsoft, respectively. For an illustration of the geometric setup, we refer to Figure 2.
The material properties of the composite are modeled by the two en ergy elastic densities Wstiﬀ,εand
Wsoft. On the stiﬀ parts, we take Wstiﬀ,ε:R2×2→[0,∞] forε>0 as a continuous function such that
Wstiﬀ,ε= 0 on SO(2) and1
cεβdistp(F,SO(2))≤Wstiﬀ,ε(F) if detF >0,
Wstiﬀ,ε(F) =∞if detF≤0,(1.3)
with a constant c >0 and a parameter β >0. While rotations do not cost any energy, deviations from
SO(2) are energetically penalized with diverging elastic constants as εtends to zero, i.e., the stiﬀ material
is asymptotically rigid. Qualitatively, this means that the stiﬀ compone nts become stiﬀer and stiﬀer as
the length scale shrinks. The tuning parameter βcontrols the degree of increasing stiﬀness and will be
chosen later to be suﬃciently large.
On the soft components, we consider a continuous function Wsoft:R2×2→[0,∞] that satisﬁes for

θ(st)≤c(1+θ(s))(1+θ(t)) for all s,t∈(0,∞),
cf. also [18, Equations (2.1), (2.2)].
Merging the modeling assumptions introduced above gives rise to a va riational problem with the
elastic energy functional (deﬁned on deformations with zero mean value)

Wε:R2×R2×2→[0,∞],(y,F)/ma√sto→Wsoft(F) /BDYsoft(y)+Wstiﬀ,ε(F) /BDYstiff(y). (1.6)
Hence, the observed deformations of the composite with checker board structure at scale ε, correspond
to minimal energy states of Iε- up to accounting for external forces, which we do not explicitly inc lude
here, as they can be handled via continuous perturbations. In the following, we focus on capturing the
eﬀective material behavior through the convergence of minimizers in the limit of vanishing length scale.
1.2.The main result. With this setup at hand, we can now state the main contribution of th is work,
the following homogenization result by Γ-convergence for the elast ic energies ( Iε)εasε→0.
Theorem 1.1 (Homogenization of checkerboard structures). LetΩ⊂R2be a bounded Lipschitz
domain,p≥2, and let Iεforε >0as in(1.5),(1.1), and(1.6)withWstiﬀ,εas in(1.3)andWsoftas

Moreover, any sequence (uε)ε⊂Lp
0(Ω;R2)withsupεIε(uε)<∞has a subsequence that converges
weakly inW1,p(Ω;R2)to an aﬃne function u: Ω→R2with vanishing mean value and ∇u∈K.
This theoremshowsrigorouslythat the eﬀective behaviorofmater ialswith high-contrastcheckerboard
structures, governed by the variational problem with functional Ihom, is restricted to aﬃne conformal
contractions. Indeed, the macroscopically attainable deformatio ns correspond exactly to the domain of
the limit energy Ihom, which comprises all aﬃne functions with zero mean value and whose g radients
are suitable positive scalar multiples of rotation matrices. The latter implies that the Poisson’s ratio
of the composites under consideration is −1, which reﬂects their auxetic nature, see Remark 2.4b). A
comparison inspired by classical homogenization results like [ 9,45] reveals that the homogenized density
Whomcoincides essentially (that is, up to maximal compressions) with the c ell formula associated to the
related model where the stiﬀ tiles are fully rigid; we refer to Remark 2.7for more details.
Further, two comments about the technical hypotheses in the pr evious theorem are in order.
Remark 1.2. a) Note that the statement of Theorem 1.1is sensitive to the regularity of the admissible
functions and fails for p<2. The intuition is that the material can break up at the connecting j oints be-
tween two stiﬀ neighboring squares, when the deformations, here W1,p-functions, can have discontinuities
in isolated points, so that a large class of limit maps can be reached, cf . Proposition 2.10. Interestingly,
this observation about the critical role of the integrability paramet er is in contrast to related homoge-
nization results for materials with strict soft inclusions [ 11,24] or layered materials [ 15,16], which are
valid for any p>1.
b) The condition β >2p−2 on the tuning parameter emerges naturally from our approach (s ee
Section1.3), but it is currently not clear whether this scaling regime is optimal. An swering this question
remains an interesting open problem. In particular, we are not awar eof explicit constructions of bounded
energy sequences converging to limit deformations other than aﬃn e conformal contractions when β∈
(0,2p−2). △A VARIATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON AUXETIC METAMATERIALS 5
1.3.Approach and methodology. The stepping stone for our analysis is a solid understanding of the
related model with rigid elasticity on the stiﬀ tiles, which results forma lly by replacing the density Wstiﬀ,ε
in (1.6) by
Wrig(F) =/braceleftBigg
0 forF∈SO(2),
∞otherwise,F∈R2×2. (1.10)
Due to this stricter assumption, the macroscopically attainable def ormations are easier to characterize,
since the possible deformations even for structures at scale ε>0, that is,uε∈ Awith
∇uε∈SO(2) on Ω ∩εYstiﬀ, (1.11)
which by well-known rigidity results (e.g., [ 47]) is equivalent to ∇uεcoinciding with a single rotation
on each connected component of εYstiﬀ, are rather limited. Indeed, each such uεcan be characterized
as the sum of a function that is piecewise aﬃne on the tiles with at most four diﬀerent gradients,
uniquely determined by two rotations, and local modulations on each soft tile with a Sobolev function
with zero boundary values (Corollary 2.2). This follows from basic geometric considerations that allow
us to determine the rigid motions acting on the boundaries of the rigid components, while accounting
for orientation preservation. The next step of identifying the wea kW1,p-limits of sequences ( uε)εis then
standard (see Proposition 2.3) and yields the aﬃne deformations with gradients in the set Kin (1.8) -
so exactly the ﬁnite-energy states of the homogenized functiona l (1.7).
Besides the insight into the case with fully rigid components, we wish to highlight two technical in-
gredients that are substantial for the proof of Theorem 1.1. They are both embedded in a general proof
strategy of asymptotic rigidity results (cf. [ 16,20,25] and also [ 27]) essential for expanding the observa-
tions on the asymptotic behavior of sequences ( uε)ε⊂ Awhen the exact diﬀerential inclusion ( 1.12) is
weakened to the approximate version
/integraldisplay
Ω∩εYstiffdistp(∇uε,SO(2))≤Cεβ(1.12)
with a constant C >0.
The ﬁrst key tool is a quantitative rigidity estimate in the spirit of the seminal work by Friesecke,
James & M¨ uller [ 27] applicable to cross structures, as stated in Lemma 3.2; by an (unscaled) cross
structureE′, we understand a non-connected open set contained in Ystiﬀconsisting of the four stiﬀ
neighboring squares of a single soft rectangle. If one applies [ 27, Theorem 3.1] individually to a function
u∈W1,p(E′;R2) restricted to each of the connected components of E′, this yields four potentially
diﬀerent rotation matrices close to the gradient of u. Lemma 3.2states that only two rotations are in
fact enough. We prove by careful geometric arguments in combina tion with an approximate version of
the non-interpenetration condition (see Lemma 3.1) that the rotations on opposite squares can be chosen
identical while preserving suitable control on the error terms. Mor e precisely, the Lp-error between the
rotations and the gradients of uis given terms of δ1/2withδ=/⌊a∇⌈⌊ldist(∇u,SO(2))/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(E′); note that the
square root is due to our technical approach and comes in through Pythagoras’ theorem. For the scaling
analysis associated with Lemma 3.2, we refer to Remark 3.3.
The second tool is a Poincar´ e-type inequality with uniform constan ts for checkerboard structures,
which has - in contrast to Lemma 3.2- a global character. Roughly speaking, we show that a function
u∈W1,p(Ω;R2) with vanishing mean value on the stiﬀ parts Ω ∩εYstiﬀand the property that the values
ofuin interior of Ω control ualso in a boundary layer, then the Lp-norm ofucan be estimated by
/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇u/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(Ω∩εYstiff;R2)multiplied with a constant independent of ε; the precise statement can be found
in Lemma 3.5. Our proof is inspired by a classical extension result in the literature . Based on [ 1] by
Acerbi, Chiad` o Piat, Dal Maso & Percivale, we derive an approximate extension result tailored for our
purposes, which then allows us to mimic the usual indirect proof of Po incar´ e’s inequality. To handle the
technicalities around the joints, where the sets of stiﬀ tiles does no t have Lipschitz boundary, we proceed
in two steps. We ﬁrst extend our functions partially from the stiﬀ to the soft parts by standard reﬂection
arguments, leaving out small balls around the corners, and then ﬁll them via an extension according
to [1].6 WOLF-PATRICK D ¨ULL, DOMINIK ENGL, AND CAROLIN KREISBECK
1.4.Outline. This paper is organizedasfollows. Section 2is concernedwith the analysisofthe auxiliary
model with full rigid tiles. After establishing the deformation behavio r of the individual soft components
on the local level in Section 2.1, we characterize in Section 2.2the set of attainable macroscopic deforma-
tions in terms of aﬃne conformal contractions. The correspondin g homogenization result via variational
convergence,which givesrise to the eﬀective energy Ihomas Γ-limit, is provenin Section 2.3. We conclude
this ﬁrst part of the paper in Section 2.4with a detailed discussion of our various modeling assumptions,
including the eﬀects of requiring orientation preservation, the Ciar let-Neˇ cas condition and p >2. The
core of this work is Section 3, where we investigate the model with diverging elastic energy contr ibution
on the stiﬀ parts as introduced in Section 1.1. We provide the technical basis in Section 3.1by proving
the two technical key tools, a quantitative rigidity estimate for cro ss structures and a Poincar´ e-type in-
equality for checkerboard structures. Section 3.2then covers the proof of the compactness statement in
Theorem 1.1and determines the possible eﬀective deformations through the we ak closure of the admissi-
ble deformations of small-scale checkerboard structures. Finally, the remaining parts of the proof of the
main result Theorem 1.1can be found in Section 3.3.
1.5.Notation. The standard unit vectors in R2are denoted by e1ande2. For two vectors a,b∈R2, we
writea·bfor their scalar product. The one-dimensional unit sphere S1consists of all vectors in R2with
unit length. For a∈R2, leta⊥:=−a2e1+a1e2, while forA∈R2×2, we deﬁne A⊥= (Ae2|−Ae1). We

IfU,V⊂R2, thenU+V:={u+v:u∈U,v∈V}describes their Minkowski sum. The notation
A⋐Bfor two sets A,B⊂R2means that Ais compactly contained in B. We refer to a non-empty,
open, connected set as a domain. Given x0∈R2andR,r>0, we setB(x0,R) ={x∈R2:|x−x0|<R}
as the ball around x0with radius R, and
A(x0,R,r) ={x∈R2:r<|x−x0|<R} (1.13)
as the annulus around x0with outer radius Rand inner radius r. We write |·|for the Lebesgue measure
and use♯(·) for the counting measure.
For an open set U⊂R2and 1≤p≤ ∞, we use the standard notation for Lebesgue and Sobolev

Throughout the document, we use C >0 for generic constants which may diﬀer from term to term;
if we want to highlight the dependence of certain quantities, we includ e them in parentheses. Finally,
families indexed with a continuous parameter ε>0 refer to any sequence ( εj)jwithεj→0 asj→ ∞.
2.Analysis of the model with fully rigid tiles
2.1.Auxiliary results. The following lemmas identify local restrictions on neighboring rotatio ns of the
stiﬀ parts in the checkerboard structure and shows that the bou ndary values of a deformation of any
single soft tile coincide with those of a piecewise aﬃne function.

the following two statements hold:

(0,1)→SO(2)being independent of Eandusuch that

i=1Ri⊂ {R,S,F ±(R,S,µ),G±(R,S,µ)} ⊂SO(2).
In particular, it holds that F±(R,S,1) =±R⊥,G±(R,S,1) =±S⊥.
b) There exist ϕ∈W1,p
0(E;R2)and a piecewise aﬃne function v:E→R2with at most two diﬀerent
gradients in the set
{(Se1|Re2),(F+(R,S,µ)e1|G−(R,S,µ)e2),(F−(R,S,µ)e1|G+(R,S,µ)e2)} ⊂R2×2
such that
u=v+ϕ. (2.2)
Proof.Case 1:Eis an open square.
After scaling and shifting, we may assume without loss of generality t hatE= (0,1)2andu(0) = 0.
Due top≥2, the trace of uis continuous on ∂E. Forp>2, this is a direct consequence of the fact that
W1,p(Ω;R2) embeds into the H¨ older space C0,1−2
p(Ω;R2). Forp= 2, this follows from the fact that the
boundary values ( 2.1) satisfy the assertion (c) of Theorem 1.5.2.3 in [ 36] if and only if they are continuous
on∂E. Because of ( 2.1), the continuity of u(∂E) and the fact that triangles which correspond in their
three side lengths are congruent, it follows that u(∂E) has to be either
i) the boundary of a rhombus with side length 1 or
ii) a straight line of length 2 or
iii) a hook with two arms of length 1 each or
iv) a straight line of length 1,
cf. Figure 3.
Fori) andii), we observe that R1=R3=:RandR2=R4=:S. Hence, the aﬃne map v:E→R2
with∇v= (Se1|Re2) andv(0) = 0 satisﬁes u(∂E) =v(∂E).8 WOLF-PATRICK D ¨ULL, DOMINIK ENGL, AND CAROLIN KREISBECK
The situations iii) andiv) imply that
R4e1=R1e2andR3e2=R2e1 (2.3)
or
R2e1=−R1e2andR3e2=−R4e1. (2.4)
For (2.3), letR:=R1,S:=R2andEnw={x∈(0,1)2:x2>x1},Ese={x∈(0,1)2:x2<x1}be
the open triangles that result from cutting Eat the diagonal. We deﬁne v:E→R2viav(0) = 0 and
∇v=/braceleftBigg
(Se1|Re2) inEnw,
(Re2|Se1) inEse.(2.5)
By construction, vis compatible along the diagonal, hence v∈W1,∞(E;R2) andv(∂E) =u(∂E).
We argue similarly for ( 2.4), settingR:=R1,S:=R4,Esw={x∈(0,1)2:x2<1−x1}and
Ene={x∈(0,1)2:x2>1−x1}. Deﬁning a continuous function v:E→R2byv(0) = 0 and
∇v=/braceleftBigg
(Se1|Re2) inEsw,
−(Re2|Se1) inEne(2.6)
yields a piecewise aﬃne function with v(∂E) =u(∂E).
Hence, we obtain the statements of the lemma for µ= 1 by deﬁning
F±(R,S,1) =±R⊥, (2.7)
G±(R,S,1) =±S⊥. (2.8)
Case 2:Eis an open rectangle and 0 <µ<1.
After scaling and shifting, we may assume without loss of generality t hatE= (0,1)×(0,µ) and that
u(0) = 0. Because of p≥2, the trace of uis again continuous on ∂E. For the same reasons as above it
follows that u(∂E) is either
i) the boundary of a parallelogram with side lengths 1 and µor
ii) a straight line of length 1+ µor
iii) the union of the two sides below or above one diagonal of a parallelog ram fromi) with the
reﬂection of the two other sides on that diagonal,
cf. Figure 4.
Fori) andii), we observe that R1=R3=:RandR2=R4=:S. Hence, the aﬃne map v:E→R2
with∇v= (Se1|Re2) andv(0) = 0 satisﬁes u(∂E) =v(∂E).
The situation iii) implies that

For (2.9), letR:=R1,S:=R2andEnw={x∈(0,1)×(0,µ) :x2>µx1},Ese={x∈(0,1)2:x2<

We argue similarly for ( 2.10), settingR:=R1,S:=R4,Esw={x∈(0,1)×(0,µ) :x2<µ(1−x1)}

The next result specializes the previous two lemmas to the case of or ientation and locally volume-
preserving maps.
Corollary 2.2 (Decomposition on a single soft tile). LetEandu∈W1,p(E;R2)be as in
Lemma2.1.
a) Ifdet∇u>0a.e. inE, then there exist R,S∈SO(2)withdet(Se1|Re2) =Se1·Re1>0,b∈R2
andϕ∈W1,p
0(E;R2)such that
u(x) = (Se1|Re2)x+b+ϕ(x)for a.e.x∈E. (2.15)
b) If additionally, det∇u= 1a.e. inE, then there exists R∈SO(2), such that
u(x) =Rx+b+ϕ(x)for a.e.x∈E.
Proof.The statement a) follows from the observation that the situations iii) andiv) in the cases 1 and
2 in the proof of Lemma 2.1can be ruled out since uis orientation preserving. Indeed, assume to the
contrary that there exists pas constructed in ( 2.5) or (2.13). In these cases, the identity ( 2.2) and the
Null-Lagrangian property of the determinant yield the contradictio ns

where the second to last equality follows by ( 2.7)–(2.8), (2.11)–(2.12) and basic algebraic properties of
the determinant. The cases ( 2.6) and (2.14) can be handled analogously.
The only remaining possible boundary values of uare described by the situations i) andii) in the
proof of Lemma 2.1. Hence, there exist two rotations R,S∈SO(2) and ϕ∈W1,p
0(E;R2), such that
(2.15) is satisﬁed. Note that det( Se1|Re2) =Se1·Re1and distinguish three cases: If det( Se1|Re2)>0,
then there is nothing to prove; otherwise det( Se1|Re2)≤0 (equality corresponds to the case ii)) and it

2.2.Macroscopic deformation behavior. In this section, we focus onmaps uε∈ Awith∇uε∈SO(2)
on Ω∩εYstiﬀ. We prove via Corollary 2.2that∇uεcan essentially only attain two diﬀerent values
Sε,Rε∈SO(2) with Sεe1·Rεe1>0 on Ω∩εYstiﬀ, which suggests an aﬃne limit with gradient in the
setKas in (1.8). The next proposition proves this statement (on any compactly c ontained subset) and
serves as the compactness result for the homogenization in Theor em2.5later in this section.
Proposition 2.3 (Characterization of limit deformations) .Letp≥2.
a) If a sequence (uε)ε⊂ A(recall(1.1)) satisﬁes

functions (uε)ε⊂ Asatisfying (2.17)and/integraltext

Proof.a)Step 1: Local-global rigidity eﬀects. First, we prove that the set of rotation matrices which
emerge from Reshetnyak’s rigidity theorem on all the connected co mponents of Ω ∩εYstiﬀhas at most
two diﬀerent elements.
Let Ω′⋐Ω and set
J′
ε={k∈Z2: Ω′∩ε(k+Y)/\⌉}atio\slash=∅}. (2.18)
Then, it holds that Ω′⊂/uniontext
k∈J′
εε(k+Y)⊂Ω forεsuﬃciently small. By Reshetnyak’s rigidity theorem,
we conclude that for each k∈Jεthere exist rotations Sk

ε∈SO(2) such that ∇uε=Sk
εonε(k+Y1)
and∇uε=Rk
εonε(k+Y3), respectively. Applying Corollary 2.2a) on each rectangle ε(k+(0,λ)×(λ,1))
andε(k+(λ,1)×(0,λ)) yields that Sk

diﬀerent values, say Sε∈SO(2) on Ω′∩ε(k+Y1) andRε∈SO(2) on Ω′∩ε(k+Y3) withRεe1·Sεe1>0
for allk∈Z2.
Step 2: Characterization of the weak limit. In light of Step 1 and ( 2.15), we can now write uε|Ω′in
the form
uε=vε+ϕεon Ω′, (2.19)
wherevε:R2→R2is aεY-periodic continuous and piecewise aﬃne function with gradients

andϕε∈W1,p(Ω′;R2) withϕε= 0 on Ω′∩εYstiﬀ.
In the following, we show that
∇ϕε⇀0 inLp(Ω′;R2×2). (2.21)
We ﬁrst observe that ( ∇ϕε)εis bounded in Lp(Ω′;R2×2) since (uε)εis weakly convergent in W1,p(Ω;R2)
and|∇vε|=√

In the last line, we used the fact that # I∂Q
ε≤C1
εfor a constant C >0 independent of ε, and|ε(k+
Ysoft)|= 2λ(1−λ)ε2. This proves the desired convergence ( 2.21).
We now address the the weak convergence of ( ∇vε)ε. First, we ﬁnd R,S∈SO(2) and (non-relabeled)
subsequences of ( Sε)εand (Rε)εsuch thatSε→SandRε→Rasε→0; the limits then satisfy
Re1·Se1≥0 sinceRεe1·Sεe1>0 for allε. We now show that
∇vε⇀λS+(1−λ)RinLp(Ω;R2×2). (2.22)
To see this, we deﬁne for εthe auxiliary functions wε(x) =εw(x
ε) forx∈R2, wherew:R2→R2is
continuous and piecewise aﬃne with the Y-periodic arrangement of gradients
∇w=


It follows with the help of the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma that
∇wε⇀/integraldisplay
Y∇wdx=λ2S+(1−λ)2R+λ(1−λ)(S+R) =λS+(1−λ)RinLp(Ω;R2×2).(2.24)
Moreover, it holds that
/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇vε−∇wε/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(Ω;R2×2)≤C(|Rε−R|+|Sε−S|) (2.25)
for a constant C >0 independent of εand Ω′. Combining ( 2.24) with (2.25) then produces ( 2.22).
In view of ( 2.19), we then obtain that
∇u=λS+(1−λ)Ra.e. on Ω′, (2.26)
by the uniqueness of weak limits. The arbitrariness of Ω′⋐Ω implies that ( 2.26) is true on all of Ω.

∇u=λS+(1−λ)R

(ˆSε)ε⊂SO(2) such that Re1·ˆSεe1>0 andˆSε→Sasε→0. We then deﬁne the continuous and

By design, the sequence ( uε)εhas the same mean value as u, satisﬁes ( 2.17), and converges to uin

Remark 2.4 (Discussion of K).a) In Proposition 2.3, we established that weak limits of sequences
inAthat satisfy ( 2.17) are characterized by aﬃne functions with gradient in Kdeﬁned as in ( 1.8). In
the following, we shall prove the second identity in this equation. We ﬁ rst observe that

K={αQ:|Ystiﬀ| ≤α2≤1,Q∈SO(2)},
since for every R,S∈SO(2) with Se1·Re1≥0 it holds that
det(λS+(1−λ)R) =|Ystiﬀ|+|Ysoft|Se1·Re1≥ |Ystiﬀ|. (2.29)

2.3.Homogenization. Now that the set of admissible limit deformations in the fully rigid setting is
characterized, we are in the position to prove a corresponding Γ-c onvergence result. Here, we consider
energyfunctionalsofintegraltypewith integrand Wεasin(1.6) withWsoftasin(1.4)andWstiﬀ,εreplaced
by (1.10). Note that in this scenario Wεdoes, in fact, not depend on ε, which is why we write Winstead
ofWεthroughout this section.
Theorem 2.5 (Homogenization of rigid checkerboard structu res).LetΩ⊂R2be a bounded
Lipschitz domain, p≥2, and let Iεforε>0as in(1.5),(1.1), and(1.6)withWstiﬀ,εreplaced by (1.10)
andWsoftas in(1.4)such thatWqc
softis polyconvex. Then, the family of functionals (Iε)εΓ-converges for
ε→0with respect to the strong Lp(Ω;R2)-topology to Ihomas in(1.7)-(1.9).
Moreover, any sequence (uε)ε⊂Lp
0(Ω;R2)withsupεIε(uε)<∞has a subsequence that converges
weakly inW1,p(Ω;R2)to some aﬃne function u: Ω→R2with vanishing mean value and ∇u∈K,
cf.(1.8).
Proof. Step 1: The lower bound. Let (uε)ε⊂Lp
0(Ω;R2) be strongly convergent with limit u∈Lp
0(Ω;R2)
and

ε→0Iε(uε)<∞.A VARIATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON AUXETIC METAMATERIALS 13
In particular, it holds that ( uε)ε⊂ A, the sequence satisﬁes ( 2.17), and has a (non-relabeled) subsequence
withuε⇀uinW1,p(Ω;R2) for someu∈W1,p(Ω;R2) due to ( 1.4) and the speciﬁc choice ( 1.10) forWrig.
In view of Proposition 2.3a), we ﬁnd that uis aﬃne with ∇u=F∈K.
To show the liminf-inequality, let Ω′⋐Ω be an arbitrary subset and let εbe suﬃciently small.

Upon taking the supremum over all compactly contained Ω′⋐Ω, we obtain the desired lower bound.
Step 2: The upper bound. The idea is to use the approximatingsequence ofProposition 2.3b) and aug-
ment it with a suitable perturbation on the softer part to enforce o ptimal energy. Preserving orientation
during this construction requires a subtle construction due to Con ti & Dolzmann [ 18].

Remark 2.6 (Properties of Whom).a) The representation of F∈KintoF=λS+ (1−λ)Rfor
R,S∈SO(2) with Re1·Se1≥0 is not unique. A direct calculation based on the intersection of two

In fact, there exist exactly two choices for RandSif|Fe1|<1, and the representation is unique if
|Fe1|= 1. Forλ=1

b) Note that if Wsoftis frame-indiﬀerent or isotropic, i.e., Wsoft(QF) =Wsoft(F) orWsoft(FQ) =
Wsoft(F) for allF∈R2×2andQ∈SO(2), then it is immediate that the quasiconvex envelope Wqc
soft
(cf. (1.14)) is frame-indiﬀerent or isotropic as well.
In caseWsofthas one of these two properties then the limit density simpliﬁes to
Whom(F) =Whom(|Fe1|Id)
forF∈K. Moreover, if Wsoftis both frame-indiﬀerent and isotropic, then
Whom(F) =|Ysoft| min

nization results in the context of asymptotic rigidity, see [ 15, Section 6] and [ 16, Remark 5.5], where the
homogenized density and the cell formula coincide everywhere.
To prove( 2.34), letF∈R2×2such thatWcell(F)<∞, which implies that there exist ψ∈W1,p

2.4.Discussion of the assumptions. In this chapter, we present a critical discussion of the necessity
of several model assumptions made in Section 2. First, we address the set of admissible functions A,
cf. (1.1), which consists of all Sobolev functions satisfying the Ciarlet-Neˇ cas condition ( CN) and orien-
tation preservation. While the macroscopic deformation behavior s tays intact when dropping either of
the two assumptions, see Remark 2.8a) and b), the material can undergo inﬁnite compression if both
conditions are dropped, see Proposition 2.9. Second, we prove that the elastic material becomes much
more ﬂexible in the case p<2 due to the occurrence of microfractures at the hinges. This sec tion is then
concluded with two ﬁnal remarks about the geometric setup of the model: the porous case and the case
of rigid rectangles.
Remark 2.8 (Orientation preservation and Ciarlet-Neˇ cas) .a) Theorem 2.5and Proposition 2.3
remain true if the Ciarlet-Neˇ cas condition ( CN) on Ω in the deﬁnition of A, see (1.1), is dropped. Indeed,
the compactness and lower bound do not require non-interpenetr ation of matter at all, while the recovery
sequences sequence designed in Proposition 2.3b) and in Step 2 of the proof of Theorem 2.5satisfy this
constraint automatically.
b) Forp >2 we shall also point out that Proposition 2.3is true if the orientation preservation
det∇u >0 a.e. in Ω is dropped instead of the Ciarlet-Neˇ cas condition ( 3.21) on Ω. In fact, we merely
need to replace Corollary 2.2by a variant that also considers the full neighboring stiﬀ squares, s ee
Proposition 3.2later in Section 3. The result essentially stays the same with the minor adjustment, t hat
the rotations S,R∈SO(2) in Corollary 2.2a) satisfySe1·Re1≥0 instead of Se1·Re1>0.
c) Exchanging the constraint of orientation preservation det ∇u>0 a.e. in Ω in the deﬁnitions of A
andWsoft, cf. (1.1) and (1.4), by incompressibility, that is,
det∇u= 1 a.e. in Ω ,
results in a fully rigid limit set and a trivial Γ-limit. Precisely, the energy s equence ( Iε)εΓ-converges
with respect to the strong topology in Lp
0(Ω;R2) to
Ihom:Lp
0(Ω;R2)→[0,∞], u/ma√sto→/braceleftBigg
0 if∇u=R∈SO(2),
∞otherwise.
This is a direct consequence of Corollary 2.2b) and the proof of Proposition 2.3a). In fact, for any
sequence (uε)εof bounded energy there is R∈SO(2) such that ∇uε⇀λR+(1−λ)R=R. As for the
energetic adjustment of the approximating sequence in Propositio n2.3b), we invoke [ 18, Theorem 2.4]
instead of Theorem [ 18, Theorem 2.1]. △
As discussed in Remark 2.8a) and b), the macroscopic deformation behavior (see Proposition 2.3)
still holds true if either the Ciarlet-Neˇ cas condition ( CN) or the orientation preservation is dropped. We
shall now discuss the scenario where all functions in W1,p(Ω;R2) are admissible. In this setting, the set
of admissible limit deformations can become larger, even allowing for inﬁ nite conformal compression, as
the following result proves.
Proposition 2.9. Letλ=1
2andp≥2.
a) If(uε)ε⊂W1,p(Ω;R2)converges weakly in W1,p(Ω;R2)to someu∈W1,p(Ω;R2), and satisﬁes the
inhomogeneous constraint (2.17), thenuis aﬃne with

the large scale compatibilities between the basic building blocks resultin g from the proof of Lemma 2.1.
The latter can be classiﬁed in three classes:
1S→R→S→R,2R⊥→R→S→ −S⊥,3S→R→ −R⊥→S⊥,
see Figure 5(rotations listed in clockwise direction, starting at the bottom).
Hence, we have that for any ε(k+Y2) andε(k+Y4) withk∈J′
ε(see (2.18)), that∇uεrestricted to
ε(k+Y) ﬁts in one of the three scenarios described above, where [ k+Y2:i] means that the rotations
on neighboring squares of ε(k+Y2) behave like ifori∈ {1,2,3}, and analogously for [ k+Y4:i] on
ε(k+Y4). In the following, we use the notation Sk

•Class II: [k+Y2: 1] & [k+Y4: 2], [k+Y2: 2] & [k+Y4: 1], [k+Y2: 3] & [k+Y4: 1], [k+Y2: 1]
& [k+Y4: 3], [k+Y2: 2] & [k+Y4: 3], [k+Y2: 3] & [k+Y4: 2].
In the following, we provide a detailed explanation of the ﬁrst of the a bove-mentioned cases.
All other scenarios can be handled analogously. We assume that [ k+Y2: 1] & [k+Y4: 2], i.e.,
Rk−e2
ε= (Sk
ε)⊥andSk+e1
ε=−(Rk
ε)⊥, (2.36)
and perform a case study. Suppose ﬁrst that [ k−e2+Y2: 1], then the ﬁrst equation in ( 2.36)
produces

ε=Sk
ε=Sk+e2
εandRk−(1,1)
ε=Rk−e2
ε= (Sk

If [k−e1+Y4: 1], we derive from ( 2.36) and (2.37) the equations

ε=Rk−(1,1)
ε=Rk−e2

In the case [ k−e1+Y4: 2] the identities in ( 2.38) also hold true. In these two cases, we obtain
the class I case [ k+Y2: 1] & [k+Y4: 1] withRk
ε= (Sk
ε)⊥. If [k−e1+Y4: 3], then ( 2.37) yields
that
Sk
ε= (Rk−(1,1)
ε)⊥= ((Sk

which is a contradiction. Suppose second that [ k−e2+Y2: 2], then ( 2.37) generates the next
contradiction
Sk
ε= (Rk−(1,1)
ε)⊥= ((Sk

Finally, assume that [ k−e2+Y2: 3], then it holds that

which we combine with ( 2.36) to produce ( 2.38) again, since [ k−e1+Y2: 1] is automatically
satisﬁed.
All the other scenariosmentioned above can be handled analogously and reduced to the special
case of class I with one of the two additional relations Sk
ε= (Rk

ε= (Sk

combinationsof ifortherestrictionof uεtoε(k−e2+Y2)andε(k−e1+Y4)yieldsacontradiction

In summary, the only relevant class to consider is class I, and applyin g the implications for any k∈J′

yields that Sk
ε=SεandRk
ε=Rεfor allk∈J′
εand suitable Sε,Rε∈SO(2). We can now proceed as in
Step 2 of the proof of Proposition 2.3a).
The identity in ( 2.35) can be shown as in ( 2.29) considering that Se1·Re1∈[−1,1] for anyS,R∈
SO(2).
b) Since we merely need to recover aﬃne functions with gradient in λSO(2)+(1 −λ)SO(2), the proof
is almost identical with that of Proposition 2.3b). The only diﬀerence is that we can omit the scalar
productSεe1·Rεe1>0 since it does not appear in this context without orientation preser vation. /square
Whereas the deformations in the case p≥2 are strongly restricted, one observes, in accordance with
intuition, much softer material behavior, as soon as microfractur e in the form of discontinuities in the
joints occur. For this next proposition, we require a suitable exten sion result, which we state and prove
directly after.
Proposition 2.10 (Aﬃne limit deformations for p <2).Let1< p <2, then any aﬃne map
u: Ω→R2can be approximated weakly in W1,p(Ω;R2)by a sequence (uε)ε⊂W1,p(Ω;R2)in such a way

Proof.Let∇u=FwithF∈R2×2. The idea is to work here with a classical Sobolev extension result
[1, Lemma 2.5], bearing in mind that in contrast to [ 12, Theorem 2.1], the functions we wish to extend
are deﬁned on diﬀerent connected components, which makes a pur e estimate of the gradients impossible.
First, we deﬁne von the stiﬀ components via
v(x) =x−k+Fkifx∈k+Y1∪Y3 (2.39)
for somek∈Z2, see e.g., Figure 6.
Let˜Ω⋑Ω be an open set covering Ω and let L:W1,p(˜Ω∩εYstiﬀ;R2)→W1,p(Ω;R2) be the operator
from Lemma 2.11forU=˜Ω andU′= Ω. Forε>0, let us then deﬁne the Sobolev function

This next lemma is needed to prove Proposition 2.10and derive suitable energy estimates later in
Section3.3.
Lemma 2.11 (Extension result for checkerboard structures) .LetU′⋐U⊂R2be bounded open
sets andε>0suﬃciently small.
a) Ifp>2, then there is a linear operator L:W1,p(U∩εYstiﬀ;R2)∩C0(U∩εYstiﬀ;R2)→W1,p(U′;R2)

b) Ifp∈(1,2), then the operator Lin a) is deﬁned on all of W1,p(U∩εYstiﬀ;R2).

operator on the domain Y2and let

p,p(Γ3;R2), T4:W1,p(Y1;R2)→W1−1
p,p(Γ4;R2)
be the projections of the trace operators of the neighboring stiﬀ components onto Γ 1,...,Γ4. In light
of [41, Theorem 4.2], there exists a linear and continuous right inverse SofT. By composing Swith
(T1,...,T 4) and arguing similarly on Y4, we ﬁnd a linear and continuous operator L(1):W1,p(Zstiﬀ;R2)∩
C0(Zstiﬀ;R2)→W1,p(Y;R2) such that L(1)u=ua.e. inYstiﬀand

Step 2: Extension on large domains. Now, letV′⋐V⊂R2andεsuﬃciently small. Then, there
exists an operator L(2):W1,p(V∩Ystiﬀ;R2)∩C0(V∩Ystiﬀ;R2)→W1,p(V′;R2) such that L(2)u=u

uk:=L(1)(u|k+Zstiff◦πk)◦π−k∈W1,p(k+(Zstiﬀ∪Y);R2)
withL(1)as in Step 2. Since uk=uonk+Zstiﬀ, we obtain that
L(2):W1,p(V∩Ystiﬀ;R2)∩C0(V∩Ystiﬀ;R2)→W1,p(V′;R2),(L(2)u)(x) =uk(x) ifx∈k+Y
is well-deﬁned and satisﬁes L(2)u=uonV′∩Ystiﬀ. On eachk+Y, it holds that

Summing this estimate over all k∈J′and exploiting ( 2.45) then yields ( 2.44).
Step 3: Scaling analysis. The desired extension operator follows immediately from a scaling ana lysis
as in the ﬁrst step of the proof of [ 1, Theorem 2.1].
Step 4:To obtain the desired result for p∈(1,2), we merely need to add the fact that the trace space

before. /squareA VARIATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON AUXETIC METAMATERIALS 21
Remark 2.12 (Porous checkerboard structures). So far, we have dealt with checkerboard struc-
tures composed of elastically stiﬀ squares εYstiﬀand soft rectangles εYsoft, so that the entire reference
conﬁguration Ω consists of an elastic material. While this model is relev ant, for example, in the produc-
tion of waterproof or airtight auxetic materials, the porous count erpart, where εYsoftis replaced by void,
is also of signiﬁcance.
To model this scenario, we choose a bounded Lipschitz domain Ω′⋐Ω and work with energies deﬁned
on the set Aεof all functions u∈W1,p(Ω∩εYstiﬀ;R2)∩C0(Ω∩εYstiﬀ;R2) with/integraltext
Ω′∩εYstiffudx= 0 and
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lu/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(Ω∩εYstiff;R2)≤M/⌊a∇⌈⌊lu/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(Ω′∩εYstiff;R2)for a ﬁxed constant M >0; the latter condition serves to avoid
concentration eﬀects near the boundary of Ω. Precisely, the ene rgies are deﬁned as
Iε:Aε→[0,∞], u/ma√sto→/integraldisplay
Ω∩εYstiffWrig(∇u)dx,
withWrigas in (1.10) andp >2. Since Iεis deﬁned on ε-dependent spaces, it is necessary to explain
the underlying topology of a corresponding Γ-convergence (and c ompactness) result. In light of Lemma
2.11, everyu∈ Acan be extended to a function LuinW1,p(Ω′;R2) with estimates of the W1,p-norms,
which allows us to use the weak topology in W1,p(Ω′;R2) for the Γ-convergence of ( Iε)ε. In particular,
we say that a sequence ( uε)εwithuε∈ Aεconverges to u∈W1,p(Ω′;R2) inW1,p(Ω′;R2) if the sequence
(Luε)ε⊂W1,p(Ω′;R2) does so.
With this notion of convergence, it is straightforward to show that (Iε)εΓ-converges to the constant
zero function deﬁned on the set of all aﬃne deformations with vanis hing mean value and gradient in K,
cf. (1.8), considering that compactness follows in view of the continuity of Lthe Poincar´ e’s inequality as
in Lemma 3.5below. △
Remark 2.13 (Checkerboard structures with rigid rectangle s).By an analogous argumenta-
tion as in the proofs of Proposition 2.3, periodic high-contrast geometries with stiﬀ parts consisting of
rectangles can be handled as well. In this situation, we set
Y1= (0,λ]×(0,µ], Y2= (0,λ]×(µ,1], Y3= (λ,1]×(µ,1], Y4= (λ,1]×(0,µ]
for givenλ,µ∈(0,1). Instead of the weak limit ( 2.24), we now obtain
∇wε⇀/integraldisplay
Y∇wdx=λµS+(1−λ)(1−µ)R+λ(1−µ)(Se1|Re2)+µ(1−λ)(Re1|Se2)
= ((λS+(1−λ)R)e1|(µS+(1−µ)R)e2) inLp(Ω;R2×2).
This yields that admissible limit deformations are aﬃne with gradient in
K={((λS+(1−λ)R)e1|(µS+(1−µ)R)e2) :R,S∈SO(2),Re1·Se1≥0}.
For everyR,S∈SO(2) with Re1·Se1≥0, we have
det/parenleftbig
((λS+(1−λ)R)e1|(µS+(1−µ)R)e2)/parenrightbig
=λµ+(1−λ)(1−µ)+(λ(1−µ)+(1−λ)µ)Se1·Re1
=|Ystiﬀ|+|Ysoft|Se1·Re1≥ |Ystiﬀ|,
as well as
|(λS+(1−λ)R)e1| ≤1,|(µS+(1−µ)R)e2| ≤1,
but
(λS+(1−λ)R)e1·(µS+(1−µ)R)e2= (µ−λ)Re1·Se2.
Hence,F∈Kis not necessarily a conformal contraction any more but the Poisso n’s ratio corresponding

We begin with a brief lemma about transferring the Ciarlet-Neˇ cas co ndition from one function to one
that is suﬃciently close with respect to the W1,p-norm.
Lemma 3.1 (Approximate Ciarlet-Neˇ cas condition). Letp>2,M⊂R2be the union of ﬁnitely
many bounded Lipschitz-domains. If u∈W1,p(M;R2)satisﬁes the Ciarlet-Neˇ cas condition (CN)for
Ω =Mand there is v∈W1,p(M;R2)with
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lu−v/⌊a∇⌈⌊lW1,p(M;R2)≤h (3.2)
for someh∈(0,1)suﬃciently small, then there exists a constant C=C(M,p)>0such that

Proof.LetM1,...,Mn⊂R2forn∈Nbe the ﬁnitely many bounded Lipschitz domains that comprise
M, i.e.,M=/uniontextn
i=1Mi. In light of the Sobolev embeddings applied to each Mi, the bound ( 3.2) is (up to
a constantC1=C1(M,p)>0) also uniform on Mi. We therefore obtain
u(Mi)⊂v(Mi)+B(0,C1h),
which, after taking the union i= 1,...,n, leads to the estimate
|u(M)| ≤ |v(M)|+C2h (3.3)A VARIATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON AUXETIC METAMATERIALS 23

The next lemma, which is substantial for characterizing the set of a dmissible limit deformations, is a
quantitative rigidity estimate in the spirit of [ 27] for cross structures E′as in (3.1). By combining Lemma
3.1with careful geometric arguments, we show that the rotations on opposite squares can be selected
identical while controlling the error terms. This result demonstrate s, in particular, that Corollary 2.2a)
holds true if orientation preservation is replaced by non-self-inter penetration of matter.
Lemma3.2(Quantitative rigidityestimatefor cross struct ures). Letp>2andE,E′,E0,...,E 4
be as in(3.1). There is a constant C=C(p)>0andδ0=δ0(p)with the following property: For every u∈
W1,p(E;R2)satisfying the Ciarlet-Neˇ cas condition (CN)onE′and for which /⌊a∇⌈⌊ldist(∇u,SO(2))/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(E′)=:

and
Re1·Se1≥ −Cδ1
2. (3.6)
Proof.This proof concentrates on the more delicate scenario µ= 1, while the case µ∈(0,1) shall be
discussed at the end. We ﬁrst establish ( 3.5) and (3.6) with the right-hand side Cδ1
3and improve the
estimate later on.
Step 1: Geometric setup. Due to the quantitative geometric rigidity estimate by Friesecke, Ja mes &
M¨ uller [27, Theorem 3.1] there exist four matrices S1,S3,R2,R4∈SO(2) such that
/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇u−Si/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(Ei,R2×2),/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇u−Rj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(Ej,R2×2)≤C/⌊a∇⌈⌊ldist(∇u,SO(2))/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(E′)
for alli∈ {1,3}andj∈ {2,4}. The reversed triangle inequality then yields that
/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇u−S1/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(E1∪E3;R2×2)≤C(/⌊a∇⌈⌊ldist(∇u,SO(2))/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(E′)+|S1−S3|),

Our primary task is to obtain an estimate for the quantities |S1−S3|and|R2−R4|in terms of powers of
/⌊a∇⌈⌊ldist(∇u,SO(2))/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(E′). Fori∈ {1,3},j∈ {2,4}we setsi=/integraltext

From this uniform estimate, we infer that u(Ek)⊂vk(Ek)+B(0,η); in particular, it holds that

a′=v2(x1), b′=v2(x2), c′=v4(x3), d′=v4(x4),(3.9)
and ﬁnd that ( 3.8) and the continuity of uyields that
|a−a′|,|b−b′|,|c−c′|,|d−d′| ≤2η. (3.10)
The goal for the remainder of this proof is to show that the polygon sabcdanda′b′c′d′are close to
a parallelogram with a small error in terms of powers of η; note that S1e1=S3e1(orR2e2=R4e2) if
abcd(ora′b′c′d′) is a parallelogram. First, we focus on the polygon abcdand estimate the deviation of
c−b=v3(x3)−v3(x2) =S3e1fromd−a=v1(x4)−v1(x1) =S1e1. In light of ( 3.9), (3.10) and the fact
thatv2,v4are a rigid body motions, we ﬁnd that
b∈A(a,1−4η,1+4η) andc∈A(d,1−4η,1+4η) (3.11)
ifηis suﬃciently small, cf. also for the notation of the annuli ( 1.13). Moreover, it holds that
|d−a|= 1 and |b−c|= 1
sincev1andv3are rigid body motions.
Step 2: Auxiliary function. In this step, we show that there exists a continuous and piecewise a ﬃne
function ¯v:E→R2such that ¯v|Eiis a rigid body motion, and

for everyi∈ {1,...,4}. Such a function is uniquely determined on E′by the vertices ¯ v(x1),...,¯v(x4).
Finding such suitable points is the goal of this next step.
Step 2a: Auxiliary points. We show that there exist ¯b∈a+S1and ¯c∈d+S1such that |¯b−¯c|= 1
and
|¯b−b|+|¯c−c| ≤Cη1

If|b−d| ≤η1

(3.13) holds ifη≪1.
Now, let |b−d|>η1
3, then we choose an arbitrary ¯b∈a+S1with|b−¯b| ≤4ηand search for a point
¯c∈d+S1that satisﬁes |¯b−¯c|= 1; note that there exist at least one but at most two options. In a ny
case, the following system of equations has to be satisﬁed by ¯ candc:
/braceleftBigg

sinceη≪1. This yields the desired estimate ( 3.13).
Step 2b: Construction of the auxiliary function ¯v.Let ¯v:E′→R2be continuous such that ¯ v|Eiis a
rigid body motion for every i∈ {1,...,4}, and
¯v(x1) =a,¯v(x2) =¯b,¯v(x3) = ¯c,and ¯v(x4) =d. (3.17)
Exactly as in the proof of Lemma 2.1(cf. Case 1), we can continuously extend ¯ vto a piecewise aﬃne
function deﬁned on all of E. We now aim to prove the estimate ( 3.12). Indeed, we ﬁrst observe that
¯v=v1onE1by design. We then consider the case i= 3. Under consideration of ( 3.9), (3.17) and (3.13),
it holds that/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftbig

Sincev3and ¯vare both rigid body motions on the bounded set E3, and|Q−Q′|=√
2|Qe1−Q′e1|for
allQ,Q′∈SO(2), we conclude that
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lv3−¯v/⌊a∇⌈⌊lW1,p(E3;R2)≤Cη1
3.
As fori∈ {2,4}, we repeat the same strategy and recall the estimates ( 3.10). Now, we have proven the
desired estimate ( 3.12).
We also point out that
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lu−¯v/⌊a∇⌈⌊lW1,p(Ei;R2)≤Cη1
3for everyi∈ {1,...,4} (3.18)
in view of ( 3.8) and (3.12).
Step 3: Estimating |S1−S3|and|R2−R4|.In the following, we diﬀerentiate between the diﬀerent
possible geometric of outcomes for ¯ v(∂E0) (in other words the polygon a¯b¯cd). While some geometries
(such as the case that a¯b¯cdis a parallelogram) provide the desired estimates for |S1−S3|and|R2−R4|,
others will be excluded via the non-interpenetration of u.
Step 3a: The ¯v(∂E0)is a parallelogram. In this case, it holds that
d−a= ¯c−¯band¯b−a= ¯c−d. (3.19)
It is then straightforward to derive
|S1−S3|=√
2|(S3−S1)e1|=√
2|(c−b)−(d−a)| ≤√
2(|(¯c−¯b)−(d−a)|+|¯c−c|+|¯b−b|)≤Cη1

from(3.9),and(3.13). Weanalogouslyconclude,underadditionalconsiderationof ( 3.10), that|R2−R4| ≤
Cη1
3. Together with ( 3.7), these inequalities already prove the desired the estimate ( 3.5) ifη≪1.
Step 3b: The ¯v(∂E0)is not a parallelogram. In this case, it holds that ¯b=dor ¯c=a. We may, due
to symmetry reasons, assume without loss of generality that ¯b=d. Moreover, let

for someϕ∈[0,π] (the caseϕ∈[0,−π] can be handled analogously), cf. Figure 11. Ifϕ=π, then (3.19)
also holds and we obtain ( 3.5) exactly as in Step 3a.
What follows is a discussion of the cases ϕ∈[0,π) where an overlap of the deformed squares ¯ v(Ei)
occurs, see Figure 11. In light of Lemma 3.1applied toM= intE′,u,pas given, and v= ¯v, we obtain
the inequality
|E′| ≤ |¯v(E′)|+C0η1
3,
for a constant C0>0; here we used ( 3.18) and that ¯vis a rigid body motion on each Ei,i∈ {1,...,4}.
We further simplify this estimate to
4−C0η1
3≤ |¯v(E′)| ≤4. (3.21)
Ifϕ= 0, then the continuity and the design of ¯ vyields that |¯v(E′)|= 2, so that ( 3.21) yields a
contradiction if η≪1. Due to monotonicity reasons, we can also exclude all cases ϕ∈[0,π
2] since
|¯v(E′)|= 3 forϕ=π
2. We shall thus assume from now on that ϕ∈(π
2,π).

the same estimate for |R2−R4|if we take ( 3.10) into account. We now set S:=S1andR:=R2and
thus, obtain the the desired estimate ( 3.5) in light of ( 3.7), (3.8) forη≪1.28 WOLF-PATRICK D ¨ULL, DOMINIK ENGL, AND CAROLIN KREISBECK
Step 4: The scalar product estimate. We now prove ( 3.6) with exponent1
3on the right-hand side.
Indeed, ifa¯b¯cdis not a parallelogram, we may assume (as in Step 3b) that ¯b=dand obtain that
Se1·Re1=Se1·(a′−b′)⊥=Se1·(a′−a)⊥+Se1·(b−b′)⊥+Se1·(¯b−b)⊥+Se1·(a−¯b)⊥
≥ −Cη1
3+Se1·(a−¯b)⊥=−Cη1
3−(d−a)·(d−a)⊥=−Cη1
3
due to (3.10), (3.13). Ifa¯b¯cdis a parallelogram and
Se1·(a−¯b)⊥=∇¯v|E1e1·∇¯v|E2e1>0, (3.24)
then it holds that
Se1·Re1≥ −Cη1
3+Se1·(a−¯b)⊥≥ −Cη1
3+∇¯v|E1e1·∇¯v|E2e1>−Cη1
3. (3.25)
Lastly, we deal with the case that ( 3.24) is not satisﬁed. If Se1·(a−¯b)⊥= 0, then there is nothing to
prove. Otherwise, let ϕ∈(−π
2,π
2) be such that ¯Re2:= ¯v|E2e2=−Rϕ¯v|E1e2and note that for ϕ= 0 it
holds that |¯v(E′)|= 1, which causes a contradiction to ( 3.21) forη≪1. Henceforth, we shall only cover
ϕ∈(0,π
2) due to symmetry reasons. In these cases, we observe an overla p of ¯v(E1) and ¯v(E4) with at
least measure1
2sin(π
2−ϕ) =1
2cosϕ. We now proceed analogously to Step 3b to ﬁnd some ϕ0∈(0,π
2)
such that1
2cosϕ0=C0η1
3withC0as in (3.21). Every geometry resulting from ϕ∈(0,ϕ0) can then be
excluded as in ( 3.22). On the other hand, for ϕ∈(ϕ0,π
2), it holds that
Se1·(a−¯b)⊥= det(Se1|¯Re2) =−sin(π
2−ϕ) =−cosϕ≥ −cosϕ0=−2C0η1
3,
and henceSe1·Re1≥ −Cη1
3similarly to ( 3.25).
Step 5: Improving the estimate. In light of Step 3, we ﬁnd that either ¯ v(∂E0) forms a parallelogram,
or it holds that ¯b=dor ¯c=atogether with ( 3.20) forϕ≥π
2. We ﬁnd in either case that |¯c−a| ≥√
2
or|¯b−d| ≥√
2 due to the parallelogram identity or the choice ϕ≥π
2. In light of ( 3.13), it holds that
|c−a| ≥lor|b−d| ≥lfor some constant length l >0 ifηis suﬃciently small. Let us assume that
the latter inequality is true. We then repeat the procedure in Steps 2 - 4 to improve the estimates ( 3.5)
and (3.6). Precisely, we ﬁrst construct a new auxiliary function ˜ v:E→R2similar to ¯vas in Step 2, for
which we ﬁrst need to ﬁnd two points ˜b∈a+S1and ˜c∈d+S1such that |˜b−˜c|= 1 and
|˜b−b|+|˜c−c| ≤Cη1
2. (3.26)
To this end, ﬁrst choose any ˜ c∈d+S1such that |˜c−c|<4ηand continue as in the proof of ( 3.14)-(3.16),
exploiting the new estimate |b−d|>lfor some constant l >0 independent of η. The rest of the proof
works analogously to the Steps 2b - 4.
Step 6: The case µ∈(0,1).The general strategy is quite similar. Step 1 stays essentially the sa me
with the diﬀerence being b∈A(a,µ−4η,µ+4η) andc∈A(d,µ−4η,µ+4η) instead of ( 3.11).
Our next task is to ﬁnd auxiliary points ¯b∈a+µS1and ¯c∈d+µS1such that |¯b−¯c|= 1 and ( 3.26)
similar to Step 2a; the construction of the auxiliary function ¯ v:E→R2with the help of these points
works exactly as before. Since µ <1 we always ﬁnd that |b−d|> lfor somel >0 independent of η
ifη≪1 is small enough. We may hence argue as in Step 5 to establish ( 3.26). SettingS:=S1and
R:=R2, we then need to prove estimates for |S−S3|,|R−R4|and the scalar product Se1·Re1similarly
to Steps 3 - 4.
To this end, we seek to exclude invalid geometries for ¯ v(∂E0) with the help of the approximate
Ciarlet-Neˇ cas condition from Lemma 3.1. The estimate ( 3.21) changes in this case to
2(1+µ2)−C0η1
2≤ |¯v(E′)| ≤2(1+µ2). (3.27)
The procedure to produce a contradiction to ( 3.27) forη≪1 is now very similar to what we presented in
Steps 3- 4 and is basedagainon ﬁnding suitable rectanglesthat emer ge fromoverlappingtwo neighboring
rigid squares. Since the general methodology is virtually the same, w e shall only explain one scenario in
detail for illustration, see also Figure 12. Let us assume that ¯b−a=Rϕ(d−a)⊥forϕ∈[0,π

we ﬁnd that the intersection of ¯ v(E3) and ¯v(E4) contains at least a triangle of measure1

and similarly for |Re2−R4e2|, which proves the desired estimate ( 3.5) when combined with ( 3.7). The
scalar product estimate ( 3.6), cf. Step 4, can be handled analogously.
Finally, we shall point out that quantity δin the formulation of the statement is simply a multiple
(dependent only on p) ofη. /square
In the following, we shall brieﬂy remark on the dependence of the co nstants and rotations in Lemma
3.2on uniform scalings and translations.
Remark 3.3 (Scaling analysis). Letρ >0 be arbitrary, then for every u∈W1,p(ρE;R2) that
satisﬁes the Ciarlet-Neˇ cas condition ( CN) onρE′and for which /⌊a∇⌈⌊ldist(∇u,SO(2))/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(ρE′)<δ0ρ2

Lp(ρE). Here, the constants δ0andC(which depend only on
p) and the rotations S,Rare exactly the same as in the case ρ= 1 in Lemma 3.2and are invariant
under translations of the domain. This is a direct consequence of a c hange of variables in the occurring
integrals. △
Next, we prove a Poincar´ e inequality for open sets of checkerboa rd structure. The prove is essentially
the same as in the case of connected open sets and is based on an ar gument via contradiction. This way,
however, we do not obtain an explicit dependence of the emerging co nstant.
Lemma 3.4 (Poincar´ e-inequality for sets with path-connec ted closure). Letp>2,N∈Nand
letU1,...,UNbe bounded Lipschitz domains such that the closure of U:=U1∪...∪UNis path-connected.
Then there exists a constant C >0with the following property: For every u∈W1,p(U;R2)∩C0(U;R2)∩
Lp
0(U;R2), it holds that
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lu/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U;R2)≤C/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇u/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U;R2×2). (3.28)30 WOLF-PATRICK D ¨ULL, DOMINIK ENGL, AND CAROLIN KREISBECK
Proof.We argue via contradiction and assume that for every j∈Nthere exists a sequence (˜ uj)j⊂
W1,p(U;R2)∩C0(U;R2)∩Lp
0(U;R2) and
/⌊a∇⌈⌊l˜uj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U;R2)>j/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇˜uj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U;R2×2). (3.29)
We now deﬁne uj:=/⌊a∇⌈⌊l˜uj/⌊a∇⌈⌊l−1
Lp(U;R2)˜ujand obtain that ( uj)jis bounded in W1,p(U;R2). In particular, each
un
j:=uj|Unforn∈ {1,...,N}is bounded in W1,p(Un;R2). We can thus ﬁnd un∈W1,p(Un;R2) such
that
un
j⇀uninW1,p(Un;R2),
un
j→uninC0(Un;R2),(3.30)
and we set
u:U→R2,x/ma√sto→un(x) ifx∈Un.
In light of the weak convergence of ( un
j)j, (3.29) and the lower-semicontinuity of the norm, we ﬁnd that
uk,iis constant on Unwith value, say dn∈R2. Since each ujis continuous on Un, andUis path-
connected, we ﬁnd that dn=dm=d∈R2for everyn,m∈ {1,...,N}. Hence, the vanishing mean value
ofuonUyields that
0 =/integraldisplay
Uu(x)dx=N/summationdisplay
n=1|Un|d,
which implies that d= 0 andu= 0 on all of U. On the other hand, we then ﬁnd a contradiction to
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lu/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U;R2)= 1 asuis the strong limit of ( uj)jonLp(U;R2), recall ( 3.30) and/⌊a∇⌈⌊luj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U;R2)= 1. /square
As we have pointed out above, it is not clear if or how the constant Cin (3.28) depends on the domain.
We address this issue in the next lemma under additional assumptions and slight change in the domains
of integration. This result serves as the second key ingredient in th e characterization of the macroscopic
deformation behavior.
Lemma 3.5 (Poincar´ e estimate for checkerboard structures ).Letp >2,U′⋐Ube bounded
Lipschitz domains, and M >0. There exists a constant C >0independent of εsuch that for every
u∈W1,p(U;R2)with

and
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lu/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U∩εYstiff;R2)≤M/⌊a∇⌈⌊lu/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U′∩εYstiff;R2) (3.32)
it holds that
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lu/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U′∩εYstiff;R2)≤C/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇u/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U∩εYstiff;R2×2).
Before we prove this result, we ﬁrst cover an alternative auxiliary e xtension-type result, in which the
deformations and the gradients can be estimated separately, cf. [1].

for everyu∈W1,p(U∩εYstiﬀ;R2)∩C0(U∩εYstiﬀ;R2).
Proof.This proof is subdivided into two main arguments. For V⊂R2withU′⋐V⋐Uwe ﬁrst ﬁnd an
operator ˆLr:W1,p(U∩εYstiﬀ;R2)∩C0(U∩εYstiﬀ;R2)→W1,p(V\(εBr∩εYsoft);R2) such that ˆLru=u
a.e. inV∩εYstiﬀand
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lˆLru/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(V\(εYsoft∩εBr);R2)≤C/⌊a∇⌈⌊lu/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U∩εYstiff;R2),

for everyu∈W1,p(U∩εYstiﬀ;R2)∩C0(U∩εYstiﬀ;R2).
For such functions u, we then deﬁne the desired operator as
Lr(u) :=˜Lr/parenleftbigˆLr(u)|V∩ε(Y\Br)/parenrightbig
where the linear and continuous map ˜Lr:W1,p(V∩ε(Y\Br);R2)→W1,p(U′;R2) is taken as in [ 1,
Theorem 2.1] for E=Y\Br. We shall now detail the construction of ˆL.
Step 1: A preliminary construction on the ﬁrst unit cell. LetZbe as in ( 2.42), and recall the
analogous deﬁnition of Zstiﬀ. Moreover, we deﬁne Yr
soft:=Ysoft\Br. The next task is to choose suitable
setsV1,...,VNforN≥8 that cover the compact set Ysoftin a particular way. Each of these sets shall
overlap with at most one of the eight straight components of ∂Ysoft, see e.g., Figure 13. Then, there
exists a partition of unity ( ϕi)iwithϕi∈C∞

i=1ϕi= 1 on/uniontextN
i=1Vi. With
standard mirroring techniques (cf. [ 2, Chapter 5]) performed on each of the sets V1,...,VN, we can thus
ﬁnd a linear and continuous operator L(1)
r:W1,p(Zstiﬀ;R2)∩C0(Zstiﬀ;R2)→W1,p(Zstiﬀ∪Yr
soft;R2) such
that

for everyu∈W1,p(Zstiﬀ;R2)∩C0(Zstiﬀ;R2). We shall point out that not all of Zstiﬀis needed to obtain
an extension on Yr
softbut it keeps the notation easier later on.
Step 2: Improvement on the ﬁrst unit cell. The next objective is to construct another extension
operator that allows better estimates for the gradients than in ( 3.34). This step can be handled similarly32 WOLF-PATRICK D ¨ULL, DOMINIK ENGL, AND CAROLIN KREISBECK

as in the Steps 2 & 3 of the proof of Lemma 2.11. /square
We are now positioned to prove the Poincar´ e-type estimate in Lemm a3.5.
Proof of Lemma 3.5.We argue via contradiction and suppose that for every j∈Nthere exists uj:=
uεj∈W1,p(U;R2) satisfying ( 3.31) and (3.32) forε=εj, and
/⌊a∇⌈⌊luj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U′∩εjYstiff;R2)>j/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇uj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U∩εjYstiff;R2×2). (3.35)
Step 1: Rescaling and extending uj.We now normalize ujby introducing
vj:=/⌊a∇⌈⌊luj/⌊a∇⌈⌊l−1
Lp(U′∩εjYstiff;R2)ujonU, (3.36)
and observe that vjstill satisﬁes ( 3.31) for allj∈N. Moreover, it holds that
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lvj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U∩εjYstiff;R2)≤Mand/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇vj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U∩εjYstiff;R2×2)<1
j(3.37)
due to (3.32) and (3.35).
Now, choose U′′⋐U′⋐U, where the set U′′is to be speciﬁed later, and apply Lemma 3.6for the pair
of setsU′′⋐Uand suﬃciently small ε. This way, we ﬁnd ¯ vj:=Lrvj∈W1,p(U′′;R2) with the properties
¯vj=vja.e. inU′′∩εjYstiﬀ\εjBr,
/⌊a∇⌈⌊l¯vj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U′′;R2)≤C(λ,p,r)/⌊a∇⌈⌊lvj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U∩εjYstiff;R2),
/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇¯vj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U′′;R2×2)≤C(λ,p,r)/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇vj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U∩εjYstiff;R2×2).(3.38)
Combining ( 3.37) with (3.38) then produces
/⌊a∇⌈⌊l¯vj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U′′;R2)≤C(λ,p,r)Mand/⌊a∇⌈⌊l∇¯vj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U′′;R2×2)<C(λ,p,r)1
j. (3.39)
Step 2: Asymptotic behavior of (¯vj)j.In view of ( 3.39), we ﬁnd that there exists a (non-relabeled)
subsequence of (¯ vj)jsuch that
¯vj→dinW1,p(U′′;R2) and ¯vj→dinC0(U′′;R2). (3.40)
for some constant vector d∈R2. In this ﬁnal step, we prove that |d|is close to 1 and close to 0 if |U′\U′′|
andrare suﬃciently small, which is a contradiction.A VARIATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON AUXETIC METAMATERIALS 33
Step 2a: The length |d|is small. First, we exploit ( 3.31) to compute that

U′′∩εjYstiff∩εjBrvj−¯vjdx+/integraldisplay
(U′\U′′)∩εjYstiffvjdx. (3.41)
The ﬁrst term in ( 3.41) converges to |Ystiﬀ||U′′|ddue to (3.40) asj→ ∞. We handle the third term in
(3.41) via H¨ older’s inequality and ( 3.37),
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
(U′\U′′)∩εjYstiffvjdx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤ /⌊a∇⌈⌊lvj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(U∩εjYstiff;R2)|U′\U′′|1−1
p≤M|U′\U′′|1−1
p (3.42)
The second term in ( 3.41) can be similarly estimated:
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
U′′∩εjYstiff∩εjBrvj−¯vjdx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤/integraldisplay

U′′|¯vj| /BDεjBrdx

U′′|¯vj| /BDεjBrdx. (3.43)
We shall also point out that |U′′∩εjBr| → |U′′|πr2and/integraltext
U′′|¯vj| /BDεjBrdx→ |d||U′′|πr2asj→ ∞.
In conclusion, we ﬁrst select for arbitrary δ >0 the setU′′⋐U′large enough that ( 3.42) is smaller
thanδ. Then, we select rsmall enough and subsequently jsuﬃciently large in such a way that ( 3.43) is
also bounded by δ, and that
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
U′′∩εjYstiff¯vjdx−|Ystiﬀ||U′′|d/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤δ
for all such j. These choices then produce
|Ystiﬀ||U′′||d| ≤3δ. (3.44)
Step 2b: Bound of |d|from below. The convergence ( 3.40) yields that
/⌊a∇⌈⌊l¯vj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lL1(U′′;R2)→ |U′′||d|asj→ ∞.
On the other hand, this norm can be estimated from below by exploitin g (3.39) and (3.36):
/⌊a∇⌈⌊l¯vj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lL1(U′′;R2)≥ /⌊a∇⌈⌊l¯vj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lL1(U′′∩εjYstiff\εjBr;R2)=/⌊a∇⌈⌊lvj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lL1(U′′∩εjYstiff\εjBr;R2)

The last two terms in ( 3.45) are handled via ( 3.37) and H¨ older’s inequality, namely
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lvj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lL1(U′′∩εjYstiff∩εjBr;R2)≤M|U′′∩εjBr|1−1
p,
and
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lvj/⌊a∇⌈⌊lL1((U′\U′′)∩εjYstiff;R2)≤M|U′\U′′|1−1
p.
Similarly to Step 2a, we then ﬁnd that |d−1|is very small which is a contradiction to ( 3.44). This
concludes the proof of this lemma. /square
Finally, we state a brief technical Lemma which ensures that ( 3.32) is satisﬁed for a suitable sequence
later on.34 WOLF-PATRICK D ¨ULL, DOMINIK ENGL, AND CAROLIN KREISBECK
Lemma 3.7. Letp >2, andU⊂R2be a bounded Lipschitz domain and let (vε)ε⊂W1,p(U;R2)be

3.2.Macroscopic deformation behavior. With technical tools and results about the local behavior
in place, we are now in a position to derive global eﬀects. The next the orem serves as the compactness
result in Theorem 1.1and is the analogon of Proposition 2.3a) in the rigid case.
Proposition 3.8 (Criterion for limit deformations). Letp >2,β >2p−2, and let (uε)ε⊂ A,
cf.(1.1), be a sequence that satisﬁes
/integraldisplay
Ω∩εYstiffdistp(∇uε,SO(2))dx≤Cεβ(3.46)
for a constant C >0independent of ε. Ifuε⇀ uinW1,p(Ω;R2)for someu∈W1,p(Ω;R2), thenuis
aﬃne with ∇u∈KwithKas in(1.8).
Proof.Throughout this proof as well as the proof of Theorem 1.1, we work on several nested compactly
contained Lipschitz domains Ω i⋐Ωi−1withi∈ {0,...,4}and Ω 0:= Ω. For such sets, we deﬁne
Jε,i={k∈Z2: Ωi∩ε(k+Y)/\⌉}atio\slash=∅} (3.47)
and observe that

cells, see ( 2.42), and note that ε(k+Z)⊂Ω forεsuﬃciently small.
Step 1: Setup. Let Ω1⋐Ω be an arbitrary bounded Lipschitz domain. We brieﬂy write
E1(ε,k) :=ε(k+Y1), E2(ε,k) :=ε(k−e1+Y3),

for a constant C >0 independent of ε. In light of Fr´ ech´ et-Kolmogorov’s theorem and the fact that
β >2p−2, we conclude that ( Sε)εconverges strongly in Lp(Ω1;R2×2) to a constant rotation S∈SO(2).36 WOLF-PATRICK D ¨ULL, DOMINIK ENGL, AND CAROLIN KREISBECK
We ﬁnd analogously that ( Rε)εconverges strongly to some R∈SO(2) inLp(Ω1;R2×2). Moreover, we
derive from ( 3.51) and (3.46) that
Sε(x)e1·Rε(x)e1≥ −Cε−2+β

sinceβ >2, which yields that Se1·Re1≥0:

ε),and deﬁne
wε:= ˆwε+/integraldisplay
Ω1∩εYstiffuε−ˆwεdx. (3.54)
The goal is the prove that wεanduεare close to each other in the Lp-sense on a suitable large subset
by comparing them on the soft and stiﬀ components separately. We ﬁrst distinguish between two cases:
if/⌊a∇⌈⌊lwε−uε/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(Ω1;R2)→0 asε→0, then there is nothing to prove. Otherwise we ﬁnd via Lemma 3.7,
applied tovε=uε−wεandU= Ω′, a subset Ω 2⋐Ω1andM >0 such that
/⌊a∇⌈⌊lvε/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(Ω1∩εYstiff;R2)≤M/⌊a∇⌈⌊lvε/⌊a∇⌈⌊lLp(Ω2∩εYstiff;R2). (3.55)
This subset can be chosen as close to Ω 1as we wish without changing the estimate ( 3.55).
On eachε(k+Y1) fork∈Jε,2we estimate

Lp(E′(ε,k))+/⌊a∇⌈⌊lSε−S/⌊a∇⌈⌊lp

and analogously on ε(k+Y3). A summation of these estimates over all k∈Jε,2in combination with
(3.46) then produces

Lp(Ω1;R2×2)+/⌊a∇⌈⌊lRε−R/⌊a∇⌈⌊lp
Lp(Ω1;R2×2)),(3.57)
where the latter two terms vanish in the limit due to Step 1. Now, let Ω 3⋐Ω2be another arbitrary
bounded Lipschitz domain. In light of ( 3.55), we may apply the Poincar´ e-typeLemma 3.5tov=uε−wε,
U= Ω2, andU′= Ω3, to obtain

for a constant C >0 independent of ε.
To produce a similar estimate on the soft components, we ﬁrst choo se yet another bounded Lipschitz
domain Ω 4⋐Ω3. We also observe that Y2⊂Y1+λe2ifλ≥1

in the case λ <1

that

with aconstant C >0independent of ε>0. Thisshowsthat uεandwεhavethe samelimit in Lp(Ω4;R2).
Sincewεconverges to an aﬃne function wwith gradient ∇w=F∈K, cf. (1.8), the limit function u
satisﬁes∇u=F∈Kon Ω4.
An exhaustion argument proves the desired result. /square
3.3.Proof of Theorem 1.1.Finally, we give the proof of Theorem 1.1, which consists of verifying the
lower and upper bounds for the Γ-convergence result.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Step 1: The lower bound. Assume that ( uε)ε⊂Lp
0(Ω;R2) converges strongly to
u∈Lp
0(Ω;R2) and satisﬁes
lim
ε→0Iε(uε) = liminf
ε→0Iε(uε)<∞;
in this case, it holds that ( uε)ε⊂ A. Due to the lower bounds ( 1.4) and (1.3) forWsoftandWstiﬀ, we
ﬁnd that ( ∇uε)εis bounded in Lp(Ω;R2). A direct application of Poincar´ e’s inequality on Ω yields the
boundedness of ( uε)εinW1,p(Ω;R2) as well as uε⇀ uinW1,p(Ω;R2) up to the selection of a (non-
relabeled) subsequence. Moreover, Proposition 3.8produces that uis aﬃne with gradient ∇u=F∈K,
cf. (1.8), in view of the lower bound ( 1.3).
From the proof of Proposition 3.8, we recall the ﬁve sets Ω 4⋐...⋐Ω1⋐Ω0= Ω together with their
index setsJε,1,...,Jε,4as in (3.47), the quantities Sε,Rεas in (3.52) with limits S,R∈SO(2), as well
aswεas in (3.54). SinceWqcis polyconvex, there exists a lower semicontinuous and convex func tion
g:R2×2×R→[0,∞] such that Wqc(F) =g(F,detF). In light of Jensen’s inequality (see [ 42, Lemma
A.2]) for extended-valued functions, we estimate

. (3.61)
We now want to exchange every uεby the easier piecewise aﬃne function wε, which is suitably close to
uε. Since|Ω4∩εYi| → |Ω4||Yi|>0 asε→0, it remains to show that
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
Ω4∩εYi(∇uε,det∇uε)−(∇wε,det∇wε)dx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle→0 (3.62)
asε→0 fori∈ {2,4}.
Lemma2.11applied to U= Ω2andU′= Ω4now generates a linear and continuous operator L:
W1,p(Ω2∩εYstiﬀ;R2)∩C0(Ω2∩εYstiﬀ;R2)→W1,p(Ω4;R2). We then ﬁnd that we may replace uεand
wεin (3.62) by the continuous functions ˜ wε:=L(wε|Ω2∩εYstiff) and ˜uε:=L(uε|Ω2∩εYstiff) since the minors
are Null-Lagrangians. For the diﬀerence in the gradients, we compu te

with a constant C >0 independent of εfori∈ {2,4}. As for the determinants, we use that ( wε)εand
(uε)εare both bounded in W1,p(Ω2;R2) to estimate
