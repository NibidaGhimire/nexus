Abstract
Omega Centauri, the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way, is believed to be the
remains of a dwarf galaxy’s core. Giving its potential abundance of dark matter (DM), it is an
attractive target for investigating the nature of this elusive substance in our local environment.
Our study demonstrates that by observing Omega Centauri with the SKA for 100 hours, we can
detect synchrotron radio or Inverse Compton (IC) emissions from the DM annihilation products.
It enables us to constrain the cross-section of DM annihilation down to ∼10−30cm3s−1for DM
mass from several GeV to 100 GeV, which is much stronger compared with other observations.
Additionally, we explore the axion, another well-motivated DM candidate, and provide stimulated
decay calculations. It turns out that the sensitivity can reach gaγγ∼10−10GeV−1for 2×10−7eV<
ma<2×10−4eV.

Modern astrophysics is still grappling with the enigmatic nature of DM. Various theories
have been put forward to explain its characteristics, including Weakly-Interacting Massive
Particles (WIMPs) and axions. WIMPs are a particularly well-motivated model, as they can
account for the correct relic abundance of DM. As a result of WIMP annihilation. Particles
such as electrons, positrons, and antiprotons can be detected by space-based telescopes [1–4].
Furthermore, these secondary cosmic ray particles would interact with their surroundings,
generating radio emissions through synchrotron and IC effects [5–8].
Moreover, axions have gained popularity as a potential solution to the strong CP problem
and are considered as a viable candidate for DM [9–13]. Axions, as well as axion-like
particles, exhibit a wide range of masses, spanning from µeV to radio frequency scales.
As a result of the coupling between axions and photons, axion decay produces line radio
emissions [14, 15]. Additionally, background photons can stimulate this axion decay [14, 15].
The radio signal is raised by both the synchrotron and IC of WIMPs and the decay of axions,
indicating that radio observation is a potent technique for detecting DM particles.
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a highly promising instrument in the field of radio
astronomy [16], renowned for its exceptional resolution and sensitivity. It is an indispensable
tool for detecting radio emissions from the annihilation products of DM particles. Extensive
research has been conducted on various sources, such as the galactic center of the Milky Way,
Draco (a dwarf galaxy), A2199 (a galaxy cluster), and Dragonfly 44 (a DM-rich galaxy) [6,
7, 14, 15, 17]. Also, DM in globular clusters has been widely discussed [18–26]. Omega
Centauri, the largest globular cluster in the Milky Way, is probably a remnant core of a
dwarf galaxy with a considerable amount of DM. Some previous work have revealed Omega
Centauri with Jfactor∼1022GeV2cm−5[27, 28]. In addition, the gamma-ray emission from
Omega Centauri has also been widely discussed as a potential outcome of WIMP annihilation
[28–30]. To confirm whether the gamma-ray emission is indeed due to WIMP annihilation
is also one of the motivations of this article.
In this study, we computed the adjoint radio emissions of DM in Omega Centauri, en-
compassing the continuum secondary synchrotron and IC radiation of Weakly Interacting
Massive Particles (WIMPs) or the decay line of axions, with the sensitivity required for
detection using SKA within 100 hours.
2This work is organized as follows: In Section II, we present some background information,
introduce the properties of Omega Centauri, and calculate the SKA sensitivity for both the
continuum and line spectrum. Then, we analyze the radio emission from the secondary
synchrotron and IC of WIMPs in Sections III, IV, and V before discussing the axion decay
model in Section VI. Lastly, we summarize our findings and discuss the results in the final
section.
II. OMEGA CENTAURI AND SKA SENSITIVITY
Omega Centauri is one of the most massive and brightest globular clusters in the Milky
Way, located 5 .4 kpc away from Earth with celestial coordinates (201 .7◦,−47.56◦). Its high
mass core and half-light radius (7 pc) as reported in Ref. [31, 32], have led scientists to
speculate that it is a remnant core of a captured dwarf galaxy [33]. Despite the numer-
ous uncertainties of dark matter in Omega Centauri, multiple observations have strongly
suggested that it could be an exceptional candidate for exploring dark matter [33, 34]. Ob-
servations of the stellar kinematics in Omega Centauri reveal a component of DM estimated
to be around 106MJ, which supports the assumption that it is a captured dwarf galaxy
remnant [17, 27]. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that the gamma-ray emission
in Omega Centauri can be explained by DM annihilation [28, 34].
For DM density in Omega Centauri, we use the NFW profile following [17]:
ρ=ρs
r
rs(1 +r
rs)2. (1)
While the total mass of DM in Omega Centauri is consider with a high degree of uncertainty
significant uncertainty. Previous studies have attempted to measure its total DM mass
through velocity dispersion, different groups have gotten the results with about one order
deviation, MDM= 2.154×106MJin [35] and 2 ×105MJin [34]. (In [35], the abundance
ofMDMis estimated based on the mass-to-light ratio and the total mass of Omega Centauri.
By assuming the universality of the mass-to-light relation, we can estimate the mass of dark
matter through various astronomical observations.) In this work, we estimate the total mass
of DM in Omega Centauri to be approximately 106MJ[17, 27] and consider three sets of
parameters: ρs= 27860 .5MJpc−3,rs= 1.0 pc ; ρs= 7650 .59MJpc−3,rs= 1.63 pc and
3ρs= 4391 .65MJpc−3, rs= 2.0 pc [17, 34]corresponding to Jfactor∼2×1023GeV2cm−5.
Additionally, considering the uncertainty in the total dark matter mass in Omega Centauri,
we need to assess the potential impact of choosing different total dark matter masses. Due
to our choice of a relatively large value for the total amount of dark matter, we explore the
parameter values ρs= 765 .059MJpc−3andrs= 1.63 pc−3, which permits us to examine
the consequences on the results when exclusively reducing the total mass by an order of
magnitude to approximately 105MJandJfactor∼2×1021GeV2cm−5.Also, Ref. [34]
increases the scale radius to 7 pc, which should have a similar effect. Using
these parameters gives us a set of relatively conservative constraint results. The velocity
dispersion of DM is expected to be around 30 km /s [17], which is much lower than that of the
Milky Way. Also, Omega Centauri is much closer to us than the dwarf galaxy. This feature
makes Omega Centauri an ideal target to probe DM properties. Furthermore, the low gas
density nature of the globular cluster ensures a negligible background in the radio frequency
range. Despite no prior reports of radio emissions from Omega Centauri, we anticipate that
the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a highly sensitive radio telescope array with advanced
energy resolution capabilities, may detect the potential radio signals.
SKA is a radio telescope under construction with high sensitivity and energy resolu-
tion [16]. SKA1-LOW and SKA1-MID cover the frequency range from 50 MHz to 50
GHz [16]. Previous radio telescopes, such as the Murchison Widefield Array, have achieved
∼O(mJy) for null-detection [5]. While SKA, in the near future, will be able to detect signals
with O( µJy) sensitivity.
The sensitivity of the SKA for specific observations can be described by the following
[16]:
Smin=2kbSDTsys
ηsAe(ηpolt∆ν)0.5. (2)
Here, kbrepresents the Boltzmann constant, and SDis a degradation factor with a value
of 2 for continuum images and 2.5 for line images. The system efficiency, represented by
ηs= 0.9, the number of polarization states, represented by ηpol= 2, the total observation
time t, and the channel width ∆ νare also included in the equation. The minimum detectable
flux is determined by the ratio of the effective collecting area Aeand the total system noise
temperature Tsys, which can be found in [16] for both SKA1 and SKA2 phases.
To calculate the minimum detectable flux for our analysis, we utilize the longest integra-
4tion time of 100 hours, a channel width of ∆ ν= 300 MHz for the continuum image, and a
channel width of ∆ ν= 10−4νfor the line image [16]. These values are chosen based on the
velocity dispersion in Omega Centauri, which is about ∼30 km /s [7, 17].
III. CALCULATION FORMULAS
The synchrotron and IC radiation of charged products from DM annihilation have been
widely discussed. Several tools have been developed to calculate this processes, such as
RX-DMFIT [36]. In this draft, we adopt the RX-DMFIT package to calculate the flux of
synchrotron and IC emission.
The equilibrium spectrum of CR e+/e−can be calculated by following equation:
∂
∂t∂ne
∂E=▽[D(E,r)▽∂ne
∂E] +∂
∂E[b(E,r)∂ne
∂E] +Q(E,r), (3)
where nis the equilibrium electron density, Q(E,r) is the injected electron source term,
D(E,r) is the diffusion coefficient and b(E,r) is the energy loss term. For the steady-state
solution, the left side of the above equation is equal to zero, and it can be solved numerically
using the Greens function method [37, 38] in the RX-DMFIT package.
The source term here is the contribution of WIMP annihilation described by the following
formula:
Q(E, r) =< σv > ρ2
χ(r)
2m2
χdN
dEinj, (4)
where dN/dE injis the e+/e−injection spectrum per WIMP annihilation event, and it is
derived from DarkSUSY package for a given DM mass and annihilation channel. For the
diffusion coefficient, we choose a simplified power law form as follows:
D(E) =D0Eγ, (5)
where D0is the diffusion coefficient in the range of 1027∼1029cm2s−1[39, 40] and we
choose γ= 1/3 in this work though the real situation may be more complicated [41].
The energy loss term contains several contributions: synchrotron, IC, Coulomb, and
5bremsstrahlung losses which are described as follows
b(E,r) = bIC(E) +bSynch(E,r) +bCoul(E) +bBrem(E)
=b0
ICE2+b0
SynchB(r)2E2+b0
Coulne(1 +log(E/m e
ne)/75) (6)
+b0
Bremne(log(E/m e
ne) + 0.36),
where neis the mean number density of thermal electrons and it is about 0 .05 cm−3for
GCs [42]. For magnetic field strength B, we conservatively choose ∼1µG here. The energy
loss coefficients are taken to be b0
syn≃0.0254, b0
IC≃0.25, b0
brem≃1.51 and b0
Coul≃6.13, all
in units of 10−16GeV/s [43].
Then the integrated flux density spectrum of the synchrotron and IC can be easily cal-
culated through the following equation
S(ν) =Z
ΩdΩZ
los(jsyn(ν, l) +jIC(Eγ, l))dl, (7)
where
jsyn(ν, r) = 2ZMχ
medEdne
dE(E, r)Psyn(ν, E, r ), (8)
jIC(Eγ, r) = 2ZMχ
medEdne
dE(E, r)PIC(E, E γ). (9)
Here PsynandPICrepresent the standard synchrotron power and IC power, which refer to
the number of photons of a specific frequency that an electron with a certain energy can
produce. Further details about these components can be found in [44].
Here, we combine synchrotron and IC radiation, which provides a more accurate depiction
of the scenario compared to the approach that calculates the impact of each component
separately. This is particularly important when the two components have equal strengths,
as their combined effect can be twice as large. These differences can result in variations in
the constraints on DM.
The IC radiation has two components: IC with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
photons and IC with starlight. However, since the frequency of starlight is already higher
than the radio band, the resulting frequency after IC is too high to be detected by SKA.
Consequently, the impact of starlight photons on the measurement is negligible.

100 hours of observation, similarly hereinafter.
IV. THE ENERGY SPECTRUM DISTRIBUTION
To account for the uncertainty of the DM profile in Omega Centauri, we investigated
the effects of different mass and NFW profile parameters as shown in Fig. 1. Our analysis
reveals that the intensity of the spectral energy distribution (SED) greatly affected by dark
matter masses. A one-order smaller mass induces a two-order lower SED, as indicated by
the two red lines in Fig. 1. Moreover, when keeping the total mass constant, a smaller rs
reduces the impact of diffusion and energy losses during the electron propagation process,
resulting in a larger SED. However, this effect is not expected to significantly influence the
final results as long as the total mass of dark matter remains constant. There remains
substantial uncertainty in determining the total amount and distribution of dark matter in
Omega Centauri. Currently, there is no way to determine the accurate value definitively, so
7here we choose ρs= 7650 .59MJpc−3andrs= 1.63 pc as a set of typical profile for the
following analysis.
FIG. 2: The SED of synchrotron and IC emission for D0= 1030cm2s−1,< σv > = 10−30cm3s−1,
B= 1µG and various choice of DM mass: 1 MeV (blue line), 1 GeV (red line), and 1 TeV (yellow
line).
The spectral energy distribution (SED) of radio emissions relies heavily on the mass of
the DM particle. That is because the energy of the electron products and the corresponding
photon flux is determined by the DM mass. In Fig. 2, we present the results of SEDs for
various mχwith fixed diffusion coefficient, magnetic field strength and cross-section. For
MeV DM, IC emission is the primary contributor, while synchrotron emission dominates for
heavier DM particles.
The diffusion coefficient and magnetic field strength also significantly affect the final radio
flux, as they impact both the charged particle propagation and photon emission processes.
Their influences on SED are presented in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. The synchrotron emission is
strongly dependent on the magnetic field since the synchrotron process is produced by the
electron propagation in the magnetic field, while the IC emission is not affected. To account
for the uncertainty of magnetic field measurements, we explored several different magnetic
field strengths as illustrated in Fig.3. The radio emission flux increases by nearly an or-
der of magnitude as the magnetic field strength rises from 0.5 µG to 2 µG. The influence
of the diffusion coefficient is shown in Fig. 4. Larger D0means that electrons are more

likely to interact with gas or other materials, resulting in more significant energy losses
before escaping the diffusion zone, which in turn leads to a lower flux. In addition, we
incorporate a free-streaming scenario to effectively bound the uncertainties in
our analysis. Notably, for a diffusion coefficient of D0= 1031cm2s−1, the be-
havior of high-energy electrons closely resembles that of free-streaming dynam-
ics. Consequently, the energy spectra exhibit a remarkable alignment with the
free-streaming model, as illustrated in Fig. 4, with only marginal discrepancies
attributed to the photon spectra produced by IC process involving low-energy
electrons.
V. THE CONSTRAINTS ON THE WIMP CASE
By comparing the results of SED with SKA’s sensitivity, we establish the upper limits
of the DM annihilation cross-section. For each parameter set, we calculate the minimum
cross-section required for the photons to be just detectable, i.e. the radio emission equals the
SKA’s sensitivity. Thus SKA offers a distinctive way of determining whether the gamma-
ray emission of Omega Centauri comes from DM annihilation. The results are presented in
Fig. 5. For simplicity, we only consider the sensitivity at 1 GHz which is 2 .6×10−7Jy [16].
9FIG. 4: The SED of synchrotron and IC emission for mχ= 10 GeV, B= 1 µG,< σv > =
10−30cm3s−1and various choice of diffusion coefficient.
The exclusion limits of DM velocity-averaged annihilation cross-section is about
10−15cm3s−1(10−17cm3s−1) at sub-GeV and 10−30cm3s−1at several GeV for electron-
positron ( µ+µ−) channel. For b¯bchannel, due to the large mass of b quark, we only have the
upper limits from GeV to TeV, where radio photons are mainly produced by synchrotron
emission, and the limits can reach 10−28cm3s−1at 10-100 GeV range. Moreover, we
use a blue shade to show the uncertainty of J-factor between 2 ×1021GeV2cm−5and
2×1023GeV2cm−5. This helps demonstrate the potential impact on the final constraints
when there is a lower amount of dark matter. Also, we compare our limits with other
previous results from different observations: The limits from M31 by the Westerbork Syn-
thesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) [45, 46], from 15 dwarf galaxies by Fermi LAT [47, 48],
Ophiuchus by VLA [49, 50], from 23 dwarf galaxies (TGSS) [51], CMB data [52–54] and
Voyager plus AMS02 data [52–54]. It is interesting to note that our constraints are gener-
ally stronger in the GeV-TeV range but weaker in the Sub-GeV range compared with other
observations. The best-fit parameter corresponding to the gamma-ray emission of Omega
Centauri [28] is also present in Fig. 5. Here we have already calibrated the DM cross-section
atJfactor = 2×1023GeV2cm−5with the result of Jfactor< σv > in Ref. [28].
The constraint of b¯bchannel is presented in Fig. 5 (c). Unlike the e+e−andµ+µ−

channel, the limit of b¯bfinal stats are mainly from synchrotron contribution because the
decay products of the b quark have so high energy that the photons generated by the
following IC process are not in the radio band. The 68% and 95% credible regions (shaded
regions) by fitting to the antiproton data [55, 56] and the 68%, 95% credible regions (black
11line) by fitting to the Galactic center GeV excess are also presented in the figure [57]. The
result shows that the SKA has sufficient capability in detecting these favored parameter
regions.
Next, we need to discuss the impact of other parameters on the limits, here we take the
e+e−annihilation channel as an example. As discussed earlier, the magnetic field solely
affects the synchrotron radiation intensity. For high-mass WIMPs, the radio emission is
predominantly from the synchrotron process, with the upper limit becoming stronger as
the magnetic field increases. However, for low-mass WIMPs, the radio emission is mainly
produced by IC radiation, so the upper limit remains unchanged, as depicted in Fig. 6. In
contrast, the diffusion coefficient considerably impacts the upper limits of the cross-section
in both synchrotron and IC cases. The diffusion coefficient in Omega Centauri also exhibits
significant uncertainty. Currently, there is no direct observational data on the diffusion coef-
ficient in dwarf galaxies or globular clusters. Since the exact value of the diffusion coefficient
is currently unknown, and here we consider a range from 1029cm2s−1to 1031cm2s−1to
explore the potential impact of different diffusion coefficients. Additionally, we consider a
free-streaming option to help bracket the uncertainties. As previously discussed, lower dif-
fusion coefficients induce tight upper limits of DM cross-section as shown in Fig. 7. Also,
we notice that for D0= 1031cm2s−1, the propagation for high energy electrons
closely approaches free-streaming and results in roughly the same upper limit.
With a high magnetic field or low diffusion coefficient, the upper limit can even reach
10−31cm3s−1for a WIMP mass of approximately 10 GeV. Furthermore, the diffusion co-
efficient only affects the constraint strength, while the peak and valley position of the DM
cross-section remains the same as shown in Fig. 7.
Generally, even if accounting for uncertainties in the diffusion coefficient and magnetic
field, all parameters interpreting the gamma-ray signals are expected to produce detectable
radio signals for SKA.
VI. CONSTRAINTS IN THE CASE OF STIMULATED DECAY OF AXION
Axions, which have a mass with the order of µeV, are also potential DM candidates.
Unlike WIMPs, they do not produce continuous synchrotron or IC radio emissions, but line
structure emissions at a frequency of ν=ma

axions in a vacuum environment is given by:

where gaγγis the axion-to-two-photon coupling parameter.
The background radio radiation at frequency ν=ma
4πenhances the photon production
rate due to the indistinguishability of photons and Bose-Einstein statistics [14, 15]. The
effective stimulated emission is given by:
Γs= Γ a(1 + 2 fγ), (11)
where Γ ais the reciprocal of τa, Γsis the stimulated emission rate and fγis the background
photon occupation number. In this work, we choose a conservative estimate by consider-
ing only the CMB and extragalactic backgrounds and ignore the Milky way background.
Additionally, since the Milky way background photons are mainly gathered in the galac-
tic center and the photon energy density decreases rapidly as the radius increases [15], the
galactic background is not expected to significantly impact Omega Centauri. The CMB and
extragalactic backgrounds can be described by the following equation [15],
fγ=fγ,CMB+fγ,exb−bkg. (12)

The flux for the line radio signal is [15]:

For point-like target, Dfactor is approximated as [63]:
Dfactor≈1

The gray regions are excluded by experiments [59–62]
The results presented in Fig. 8 demonstrate a continuous limit between 10−7eV∼
10−4eV, providing a significant improvement over previous studies [59–62]. Unlike the
calculation of radio signals from axion-photon resonant conversion in the magnetospheres of
magnetic white dwarf stars or neutron stars, which heavily depends on the compact stars
model and magnetic field strength, our results are independent of these parameters. Fur-
thermore, using SKA1, we obtained an upper limit of approximately 10−10GeV−1, and with
SKA2, the limit can be improved to 10−11GeV−1, surpassing the current result from CAST.
Therefore, SKA provides an excellent opportunity for the detection of low-mass axions.
VII. CONCLUSION
Omega Centauri is proposed as a DM-rich globular cluster near the Milky Way. Here,
we calculated the radio emission from the DM annihilation/decay, including WIMPs and
15axions, and discussed the detection capability of SKA.
The synchrotron and IC emissions from cosmic ray e+/e−produced by WIMP anni-
hilation provide a complementary method for detecting DM particles. We calculate the
synchrotron and IC emission of WIMP annihilation in Omega Centauri and evaluate the
measurement prospects of SKA. Our calculations show that, for the dark matter parameters
associated with the gamma-ray emission from Omega Centauri resulting from dark matter
annihilation into muon channel, the radio emissions are detectable relative to the sensitivity
of the SKA. By setting the radio emission flux from DM annihilation to be less than SKA’s
sensitivity at ν= 1 GHz, we obtain the upper limits of DM cross-section for DM masses
from MeV to TeV. The upper limits can reach 10−30cm3s−1at 10 GeV, which is much
stronger compared with other observations. In general, the measurement of SKA can be
used to test the parameter space proposed to explain the tentative gamma-ray radiation of
Omega Centauri or that involved in interpreting the Galactic GeV excess, antiproton excess
and the W-boson mass anomaly [64, 65] in the near future.
Next, we calculate the line emission in the radio band from the stimulated decay of
axions. The projected sensitivity of SKA is shown in Fig. 8, and it is effective over a broad
mass range of 10−7−10−4eV. Generally speaking, SKA can probe some of the unexplored
axion-photon coupling regions.
In summary, the SKA’s high sensitivity allows us to investigate the untapped param-
eter space of DM annihilation or decay. With multi-frequency measurements, some DM
candidates suggested in the literature can be effectively tested.
