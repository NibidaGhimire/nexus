Abstract
In quantum optics it is usual to describe the basic energy quanta of the electromagnetic
(EM) eld, photons, in terms of monochromatic waves which have a denite energy and
momentum, and satisfy bosonic commutation relations. Taking this approach, however,
leads to several no-go theorems regarding the localisability and superluminal propagation
of single photons. Unfortunately, without a local quantum description of the EM eld
it becomes dicult to describe the specic dynamics of light in the presence of local
interactions or local boundary conditions.
In this thesis we take an alternative approach and quantise the free EM eld in both
one and three dimensions in terms of quanta that are perfectly localised and propagate at
the speed of light without dispersion. Our approach has two characteristics that allow it
to overcome earlier no-go theorems. Firstly, we make a clear distinction between particles,
which can always be localised, and the electric and magnetic elds, which cannot; and
secondly, we remove the lower bound on the Hamiltonian, thereby introducing negative-
frequency photons from basic principles.
Afterwards we test our quantisation scheme by studying the propagation of light in a
linear optics experiment analogous to that studied in Fermi's two-atom problem [1]. Here
we show that, unlike standard quantisation schemes, our approach predicts the causal
propagation of localised photonic wave packets. We also use our theory to provide a new
perspective on the Casimir eect in both one and three dimensions. In this part of the
thesis we predict an attractive force between two highly-reecting metallic plates without
having to invoke regularisation procedures.Contents

Introduction
1.1 Our perception of light
Most of the things that we see about us are slow and heavy, and occupy very limited
regions of space. Light, on the other hand, has a very dierent kind of existence: it
travels extremely quickly, doesn't appear to weigh anything, and seemingly has no xed
size. Although these unconventional properties are quite familiar to us, they rarely leave
much of an impression on our thoughts; usually we are only interested in what we can see
by the light rather than the light itself. Nevertheless, light possesses certain unmistakable
characteristics that have greatly inuenced our theoretical ideas, from the discovery of
Lorentz invariance to development of wave-particle duality.
We imagine, for instance, that when a light source is turned on the light propagates
away from the source in the form of long narrow beams or rays. We nd ourselves
inclined to this idea because we are used to seeing the way sunlight casts shadows on
the ground when we obstruct its path. We also know that light can be reected or
refracted when passing from one material to another of a dierent kind. The study of
the geometric relations between the trajectories of these rays is called geometrical optics
[2], and captures well the dynamics of light through the simplest optical devices, such as
mirrors, lenses and pin-hole cameras.
89
Sir Isaac Newton believed, based on the many experiments he conducted, that rays
of light are composed of a stream of very light elastic particles, each travelling at large
but nite speeds in a straight line [3]. This theory is a very instinctive one that likens
the propagation, reection and refraction of light to the mechanical interactions of small
heavy particles. The corpuscular theory, as it is called, is also one that Newton believed
was necessary to explain many other properties of light, for example, the separation of
white light into a spectrum of dierent colours by a prism.
The Dutch mathematician and contemporary of Newton, Christiaan Huygens [4], was
able to explain many of the known properties of light by means of a wave theory. Huygens
suggested, taking inspiration from the properties of sound, that light is not itself made
up of small particles, but is rather a wave or ripple through some invisible corpuscular
substance. When a corpuscle was set in motion it would clatter against its neighbours,
and they against theirs, causing the energy and momentum of the initial motion to
spread throughout space. Huygens demonstrated that the compounded motion of these
corpuscles propagated in straight lines and was refracted at surface interfaces. Despite
some initial failings, the wave theory eventually became favoured over the corpuscular
theory following further advancements by Augustin-Jean Fresnel and Thomas Young.
The most important advancement in our understanding of light came in the early
nineteenth century following the discoveries of Michael Faraday and Hans Christian
Oersted [2, 5], who demonstrated that a uctuating magnetic eld will generate an
electric eld and, conversely, that a current or uctuating electric eld will generate
a magnetic eld. The inseparable dynamics of the electric and magnetic elds became
collectively expressed through the dynamics of a combined electromagnetic (EM) eld.
There are four equations that govern the dynamics of the EM eld known collectively as
the Maxwell-Heaviside equations, or simply Maxwell's equations, after the two scientists
who developed them: James Clerk-Maxwell and Oliver Heaviside [5, 6]. By studying
these equations, Maxwell found that certain components of both the electric and mag-
netic elds propagate across space in the form of waves. Crucially, he noticed that the10
calculated velocity of these electromagnetic waves was very close to the measured velo-
city of light. The connection seemed obvious. Maxwell had discovered that light is an
electromagnetic wave.
What is most interesting about these theories is that they all clearly exhibit the
characteristics of locality. In each of these theories, the properties of light can be inde-
pendently described at each point in space and time. In Newton's theory, for example,
each light particle has a denite position in space whose motion can be predicted; in Huy-
gens's theory, the position and motion of each corpuscle of the wave medium can similarly
be dened; and, most importantly, in Maxwell's theory, the amplitudes of the electric
and magnetic elds can be specied at each point in space and time. When described in
this way we can understand the behaviour of light by looking at how the eld changes
from place to place. This is an incredibly useful and insightful means of studying the
EM eld; not only because it is an idea congenial to our ordinary mode of thinking, but
because the interactions between light and matter occur in a truly position-dependent
way, even at the most fundamental level.
In modern electrodynamics, however, light is not described by the classical EM eld,
but is instead expressed in terms of a quantised set of electric and magnetic eld ob-
servables. Such eld observables do not take a specic numerical value at each point
in space and time as the classical elds do, but rather are a set of operators that act
on a Hilbert space of quantum states. The most natural way of characterising these
states is in terms of the eigenstates of the conserved and commuting generators of the
Poincar e algebra; namely the energy, momentum and angular momentum operators. The
position operator, however, not being part of the Poincar e algebra, is only a secondary
construction dened more for our own convenience than anything else, if it can be dened
at all. The quantum states of the EM eld, therefore, are not naturally expressed in a
position-dependent way. As an alternative, we are often satised to look only at the over-
all scattering dynamics of a particular interaction. This method, however, does not give
a full understanding of the intermediate evolution of a state. Moreover, it is not always11
possible to construct a Hamiltonian for every system. In such cases, other methods such
as the triplet mode [7, 8] and mirror image [9, 10] approaches must be utilised, which
often means introducing additional unphysical degrees of freedom. A position-dependent
description of photon wave packets is needed.
1.2 The search for a photon position wave function
One of the most well known attempts to derive a mathematically rigorous single-particle
position operator was carried out by Newton and Wigner in 1948 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
which built on the earlier work of Pryce [18]. The eigenstates of the Newton-Wigner (NW)
position operator describe particles that are localised in every direction, are spherically
symmetric and transform correctly under rotations. Examples of alternative localisation
criteria can be found, for example, in Refs. [19, 20]. Although Newton and Wigner
succeeded in dening such an operator for particles of nite mass and arbitrary spin, a
position operator could not be dened for massless particles with a spin greater than
one half (the photon is a spin-one particle). A short proof of this can be found in
Ref. [21]. In particular, position eigenstates cannot be dened that are both localised
and spherically symmetric. More recently, however, Hawton [22] has noticed that it
would be more accurate to say that the photon position operator must have a cylindrical
rather than spherical symmetry due to the divergence condition on the free EM elds.
Further research on NW localisation was carried out for example by Wightman [23] and
Fleming [24, 25] who similarly found the photon could not be localised. Wightman, for
instance, reformulated the work of Newton and Wigner in the framework of imprimitive
representations of the Euclidean group [26]. Jauch and Piron [27] have since generalised
some of the axioms in Wightman's scheme developing the notion of weak localisation for
photons. See also Ref. [28].
Notwithstanding the results of Newton and Wigner, several dierent approaches for
constructing photon position wave functions have been introduced [29, 30, 31, 32, 33].
For instance, Hawton was able to construct a photon position operator with commuting12
components and transversely polarised eigenstates by taking into consideration the lon-
gitudinally polarised components of the photon wave function [22, 34, 35, 36, 37]. These
components were previously discounted due to the divergence condition on the photon
wave function which removed such contributions. Hawton's position operator can be
determined from the Pryce position operator by introducing a term closely related to
Bia lynicki-Birula's phase invariant derivative [34, 36, 38, 39]. This position operator also
has a cylindrical rather than a spherical symmetry [22]. In close relation to the local
photo-detection operators constructed by Glauber [40], other authors have suggested
that a meaningful single-photon wave function ought to be locally related to the eld
observables, which would then have a more direct physical interpretation. For example,
Bia lynicki-Birula [41, 42, 43], Sipe [44], and Smith and Raymer [45] constructed both
rst and second quantised solutions of a massless Dirac-like equation and obtained wave
functions that are locally related to the Riemann-Silberstein vector [46], and, therefore,
the electric and magnetic eld observables. On the other hand, in the view of Knight
[47] and Licht [48, 49] a photon can only be localised if the EM eld expectation values
are identical to the ground state expectation values everywhere but at the point of loc-
alisation. From this point of view, however, when the eld observables do not commute,
single photons cannot be localised [50].
In the approach of Bia lynicki-Birula and others, when the wave function is locally
related to the eld observables, the typical Born rule now provides an energy rather
than a probability causing further diculties for the interpretation of the wave function.
There are two ways of circumventing this problem. One method is to introduce a modied
inner product that has the correct dimensions. This can be done by either normalising the
photon wave function with respect to the photon energy, as was done in Refs. [41, 43, 45,
51, 52], or by treating the system as a biorthogonal system [30, 35, 45, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57].
For further reading on biorthogonal systems see, for example, Refs. [58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63].
This latter approach introduces a non-standard inner product that normalises the wave
functions by a term with units of energy. The inner product between eld states then has13
the typical units of probability density and may retain its usual probability interpretation.
Although useful [64], introducing a new inner product can often be impractical and
some intuition for the wave function may be lost. A second and simpler alternative is
to consider the excitations with the correct units as physical regardless of their relation
to the eld observables. This approach was adopted in the development of the Landau-
Peierls wave function [65]. The Landau-Peierls wave function has been criticised for its
non-local transformation properties [12]; nevertheless, it has since been revived by Cook
[66, 67] and Mandel [68, 69] who have constructed second quantised position-dependent
excitations for which the corresponding wave function represents the probability distri-
bution of the state. In spite of all this there is as yet no clear choice for the position wave
function of the photon, and many dierent factors must be considered in each choice.
1.3 Diculties with causality
Another important aspect to consider when describing the local behaviour of light is
the light principle [70]. The solutions of Maxwell's equations in a vacuum describe a
set of waves that propagate away from the source at a constant and nite speed c, the
speed of light, along the boundaries of the light-cone (see Fig. 1.3). The speed of light
is constant with respect to all observers, and naturally this places a lower bound on
the time it takes for a signal to propagate from its sender to a receiver. Needless to
say, it is important that this lower bound be apparent in any quantum theory of light.
The localised quanta of light, therefore, should propagate from one place to another at
a constant and nite speed, without dispersion, and take a nite time to make their
journey. The standard formulation of quantum eld theory is inherently relativistic and
some notion of causality arises naturally; in particular, the microcausality condition
always applies. It is a result of this condition that there are no causal relationships
between measurements made at points that are space-like separated or, in other words,
do not lie in each other's light-cones [71]. This prohibits any form of signalling between
two such points. However, the localisation of single photons results in another problem14
[72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84]. In a paper published in 1974, Hegerfeldt
[72] provided a short proof that, if the probability of detecting a particle in a certain region
of space is given by the expectation value of some suitably chosen projection operator,
then that same particle will either spread out superluminally or remain stationary [85].
This has led some to think that particles cannot be localised at all [86, 87, 88]. Similar
proofs were also found by Malament [73], and Halvorsen and Clifton, [78]. The only
assumptions made in this derivation were that the particle Hamiltonian is bounded below
and the system is translation invariant; however, more recently it has been shown that
the sole cause of the spreading is a lower bound placed on the Hamiltonian [85, 89].

well's equations, indicated by the red spots, propagate along the boundaries of the light-
cones from the past into the future. The light-cone boundaries are parametrised by
x=ct
.
A particular problem that has been greatly studied in the context of causality vi-
olations is Fermi's two-atom problem. The aim of the problem, originally posed by
Fermi in 1932 [1], is to calculate the time taken by an excited atom to excite a dis-
tant second atom, initially in its ground state, by the transmission of a single photon.
Causality considerations would suggest that there is a minimum delay between the emis-
sion and absorption of the photon which would allow for the causal propagation of the15
light signal between the atoms. Fermi originally concluded that the process occurs caus-
ally, but it was later shown that this result depends on an approximation. Without
this approximation it is predicted that the second atom will be excited immediately
[90]. There is some disagreement on whether there is a causality violation in this ex-
periment. Most authors seem to believe that causality is preserved, but this is largely
in the sense of no signalling rather than of no interatomic correlations, and that strict
Einstein causality is lost [91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97]. It may also be possible to exper-
imentally measure these correlations [98]. Others believe there are no violations at all
[99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108]. In many cases, the result is strongly
tied up with the approximations used to dene a coupling between the eld and atoms
[91, 102], the nal state of the source [93, 94] or the way the system evolves [99], which
makes it dicult to draw any clear conclusions. Nevertheless, from the point of view of
localised wave packets, instantaneous excitation makes no intuitive sense.
1.4 The Problem
From our experience we know that light is something that ought to be thought of as hav-
ing a denite position in space and time. This is the case in classical electromagnetism
where light is represented by a pair of electric and magnetic eld vectors parametrised by
a coordinate rand a timet. In quantum physics too, the position of a photon has a proper
realisation in many experiments such as the measurement of position-momentum correla-
tions. In Ref. [109], for example, the authors used a two-photon position-dependent wave
function in order to theoretically calculate the measurable position cross-spectral density
function. What is more, from a theoretical point of view, a position-dependent wave
function approach to quantum optics is also necessary for modelling the exact dynamics
of many locally-interacting systems, as in, for example, Ref. [110].
In spite of this, in standard quantum electrodynamics it has not been possible to
construct a single-photon position operator ^rwith commuting components and spheric-
ally symmetric eigenvalues that also satises the usual Heisenberg relation^r;^p
=i~.16
This prohibits us from constructing photon wave functions in a localised position basis
for light polarised in any xed direction. It is possible to construct approximate wave
functions that may represent the local behaviour of light in some sensible and useful
way, but even so, when the Hamiltonian operator is bounded below, all initially localised
wave functions will disperse, immediately lling all of space after any non-zero time. This
implies that an initially localised photon can be found at a position outside of its own
light-cone. If one wishes to construct a wave function whose square modulus represents
the position of a photon, such a possibility cannot be allowed.
The problem we face is that the current theory of the quantised EM eld does not
permit a description of localised photon wave packets that propagate causally as are
experienced in experiments. The purpose of this thesis is to construct a theory of local
photon wave packets in the free EM eld theory that overcomes the problems described
above and brings new insight into the behaviour of single-photon wave packets. The
outlook for this work is to apply our new theory to studies of light in systems whose
properties dier from place to place, such as inhomogeneous media, gravitational elds or
non-inertial reference frames [111, 112], and to studies of wave packets with more complex
structures, such as waves carrying orbital angular momentum [113]. Many interesting
and strange eects arise when studying quantum systems in non-inertial frames [114,
115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122], and we expect a local description of the quantised
EM eld to provide the tools necessary for describing the complete dynamics of light in
these systems in a very intuitive way.
This thesis is divided into eight chapters. In Chapters 2 and 3 we shall review the
classical and quantum theories of the free EM eld. In each case we shall pay special
attention to the degrees of freedom used to characterise wave packets of light, noting
both the similarities and dierences. In particular we notice that light in the classical
description is characterised by a greater number of parameters than in the quantum
theory. In Chapters 4 and 5 we point out that, due to a deciency in the available degrees
of freedom, it is not possible to construct localised solutions of Maxwell's equations that17
propagate at the speed of light using the current quantum theory. We therefore construct
a more complete quantum theory of light in both one and three dimensions that permits
such solutions. In this scheme the existence of localised particles is assumed and the
eld observables then derived by demanding consistency with Maxwell's equations. A
relevant Schr odinger equation is also derived for this system, and the relation of this
new theory to the standard theory of the free EM eld will be discussed. In Chapter
6 we shall study an experiment of my own design that provides an analogue to Fermi's
two-atom problem without the need for atoms. In this chapter, we shall investigate the
apparent problems relating to causality inherent to the standard description of photons
and show that our new description does not suer from the same diculties. In Chapter
7 we shall apply the new theory to a study of the Casimir eect between two perfectly
reecting parallel-plate conductors. This will allow us not only to test the validity of
the new theory against well known predictions, but also to uncover a new understanding
of the underlying mechanisms of this eect in the more tangible position representation.
We shall conclude with a discussion of results in Chapter 8.Part I
Preliminaries

Classical electromagnetism
In this chapter we look at some background material on the classical theory of the free EM
eld that will be relevant in the next chapter, where we discuss standard quantisations
of the free EM eld, and for new work in Chapters 4 to 7. In this section we dene
the free-space Maxwell's equations in both the position and momentum representations,
which provides the fundamental equations of motion for light in a vacuum, and dene
the energy and Poynting vector of the eld. Later we shall calculate the solutions of
Maxwell's equations in both one and three dimensions which will be useful in Chapters
4 and 5. We shall pay particular attention to the degrees of freedom that arise in the
classical theory as these dier from those available in the quantum theory. We shall also
show that the Hamiltonian for the free EM eld takes the form of a simple harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonian in order to motivate discussions in the next chapter.
2.1 The classical theory of the free radiation eld
2.1.1 Electric and magnetic elds
Electric and Magnetic elds in the position representation
The theory of electromagnetism is concerned with the properties and dynamics of two
fundamental quantities: the electric eld E(r;t) and the magnetic eld B(r;t). These
1920
two elds are vector valued, having components in all three space dimensions, and are
parametrised by a position vector rand a time t, which represent the position and time
at which the elds are measured. Both of these elds are real; however, in the following
we shall reserve the notation E(r;t) and B(r;t) for the complex electric and magnetic
elds respectively unless we make specic mention otherwise. The total real elds are
given by the superposition (1 =2)(O+O) where O=E;B. Here and in the remainder
of this thesis, * denotes complex conjugation.
The Lorentz force
When a charged material is placed in a non-vanishing electric or magnetic eld, both
elds will exert a force f(r;t) on the material at each point rand timet. This force is
the Lorentz force, and depends on both the charge density (r;t) and current density
j(r;t) of the material, and the magnitude of the total electric and magnetic elds at the
point rat a timet. This force can be calculated using the following equation:
f(r;t) =(r;t)E(r;t) +j(r;t)B(r;t): (2.1)
Here E(r;t) and B(r;t) are the real elds. Like the electric and magnetic elds, the
Lorentz force is a three-dimensional vector or 3-vector, and its direction indicates the
direction of the applied force.
Electric and magnetic elds in the momentum representation
In this thesis it will often be convenient to express the position-dependent electric and
magnetic elds in their Fourier representations. The Fourier components of the electric
and magnetic elds, like the elds themselves, are 3-vector valued, and parametrised
by a timet. In the momentum representation, the elds are also parametrised by a
real 3-vector kthat replaces the original space component r. We denote the Fourier
components of the complex electric and magnetic elds eE(k;t) andeB(k;t) respectively.21
Hence, the Fourier representations of the electric and magnetic elds are given by
O(r;t) =Z
R3d3k
(2)3=2eikreO(k;t) (2.2)
where O=E;BandeO=eE;eBaccordingly. The inverse transformation, which expresses
the Fourier components as a superposition of the original eld amplitudes, is given by
eO(k;t) =Z
R3d3r
(2)3=2eikrO(r;t): (2.3)
2.1.2 Maxwell's equations and the wave equation
Maxwell's equations in a vacuum
The dynamics of the electric and magnetic elds are governed by four local and rst-order
dierential equations known as Maxwell's equations [6, 123, 124, 125]. Two of these four
equations have an explicit dependence on the charge density and the charge current dens-
ity, which inuence the surrounding electric and magnetic elds. The Maxwell equations
for the real elds are
rE(r;t) =(r;t)
"0(2.4)
rB(r;t) = 0 (2.5)
rE(r;t) = @
@tB(r;t) (2.6)
rB(r;t) =1
c2@
@tE(r;t) +0j(r;t): (2.7)
In the above "0and0are both constants denoting the permittivity and permeability of
the vacuum respectively. The factor cis also a constant related to the permittivity and
permeability of the vacuum according to the relation c= 1=p"00.
In a system in which there are neither electrical currents nor charged matter, the
charge density (r;t) and charge current density j(r;t) vanish everywhere: (r;t) =
j(r;t) = 0 for all randt. A system of this kind is called free space, and we may22
determine for this system a simpler set of Maxwell's equations. In free space, Maxwell's
equations take the form
rE(r;t) = 0 (2.8)
rB(r;t) = 0 (2.9)
rE(r;t) = @
@tB(r) (2.10)
rB(r;t) =1
c2@
@tE(r;t) (2.11)
where the above elds are now complex. The elds that propagate in free space are
known as the free elds.
Free eld Maxwell's equations in the momentum representation
In Section 2.1.1, we expressed the electric and magnetic elds as Fourier transforms of the
vector eldseE(k;t) andeB(k;t) respectively. The free-space Maxwell's equations for the
position-dependent elds therefore imply four equivalent equations for the components
of the k-dependent elds. These four new equations are given by
keE(k;t) = 0 (2.12)
keB(k;t) = 0 (2.13)
ikeE(k;t) = @
@teB(k;t) (2.14)
ikeB(k;t) =1
c2@
@teE(k;t): (2.15)
Which sign to pick depends on the choice of sign made in Eq. (2.2).
The wave equation
The dynamics of the electric and magnetic elds are specied by the two equations
Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11). These equations are not independent of each other, but couple
together dierent components of both the electric and magnetic eld vectors by express-23
ing the dynamics of one component in terms of various derivatives of the others. If one
considers, however, the curl of Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11), then, by making careful substitu-
tions of the other Maxwell equations, one can show that, in free space, the electric and
magnetic eld vectors each obey their own wave equation. The wave equation mentioned
is given by

r2 1
c2@2
@t2
O(r;t) = 0: (2.16)
When the elds are expressed in a Cartesian basis, each component of E(r;t) and B(r;t)
will independently satisfy the above wave equation. This wave equation is a second order
equation that describes the dynamics of a wave that propagates at a velocity c. The
constantc= 1=p00is the speed of light.
2.1.3 The energy of the radiation eld
The electromagnetic eld will exert a force, determined by the Lorentz force law (2.1), on
any charged matter, and must therefore contain a certain amount of energy that enables
it to do work on the charged material. One of the most direct ways to determine the
energy of the free eld in a particular region of space is to consider the work done by the
eld on any charged matter that is placed in the vicinity [123]. The expression for the
rate of work done on any charged matter propagating at a velocity v(r;t) in a region V
is
d
dtZ
Vd3rW(r;t) =Z
Vd3r f(r;t)v(r;t)
=Z
Vd3r1
(r;t)f(r;t)j(r;t)
=Z
Vd3r E(r;t)j(r;t): (2.17)
In the above expression, f(r;t) is the Lorentz force density exerted by the elds on the
charged matter, which is substituted into the third line of Eq. (2.17). The magnetic eld24
does not appear in the nal expression because it always exerts a force that is orthogonal
to the velocity of the charged matter. The vector eld v(r;t), which represents the
velocity density of the charged matter, is equivalent to the charge current density j(r;t)
divided by the charge density (r;t) at the same location and time.
If Eq. (2.7) is used to make a substitution for j(r;t) in the right-hand side of Eq. (2.17),
an expression is found for the work done on charged matter in terms of the changes in
the electromagnetic eld in contact with that charged matter. After carrying out this
substitution, and by using Eq. (2.6) in the manipulation of terms, one is able to show
that Eq. (2.17) can be rewritten in the form
d
dtZ
Vd3rW= @
@tZ
Vd3r"(r;t) Z
@VdnS(r;t) (2.18)
where
"(r;t) ="0
2
jE(r;t)j2+c2jB(r;t)j2
(2.19)
and
S(r;t) =1
0[E(r;t)B(r;t)]: (2.20)
In the above E(r;t) and B(r;t) refer to the total real elds. One may determine from
this expression that the rate of work done is equal to the dierence between the rate at
which the total "(r;t) decreases and the ux of S(r;t) out of the volume V. If the total
work done on some charged matter is attributed purely to an electromagnetic force, then,
by considering the conservation of electromagnetic energy, one may naturally associate
the"(r;t) in Eq. (2.19) with the energy density of the EM eld, and S(r;t) with the
change in the energy ux density of the EM eld per unit time. S(r;t) is also known as
the Poynting vector.
If we return now to the free-space system containing no charged particles, and consider
the system in which Vencompasses all of space, then, assuming that the Poynting vector25
vanishes at the innite boundaries of our system, the total energy of the free EM eld is
given by
Henergy =Z
R3d3r"0
2
jE(r;t)j2+c2jB(r;t)j2
: (2.21)
The total energy of the system is constant.
2.1.4 The solutions of Maxwell's equations in one dimension
A particularly important class of solutions to the wave equation, Eq. (2.16), are the one-
dimensional solutions. The components of the one-dimensional EM eld have a depend-
ence on only one of the three space coordinates, in addition to the usual time coordinate,
and remain constant in the two remaining dimensions. Consequently, propagation of
electromagnetic waves takes place in this one dimension only. It is important to note
that, although the one-dimensional solutions propagate in one direction only, the electric
and magnetic elds still inhabit three-dimensional space, and therefore the vector eld
amplitudes may be directed or polarised along any axis.
Let us consider the electric and magnetic eld vectors whose amplitudes depend only
upon thexCartesian coordinate, measured along the xaxis, and a time t:E(x;t) and
B(x;t). With this simplication, the wave equation (2.16) reduces to the following:
@2
@x2 1
c2@2
@t2
Oi(x;t) = 0: (2.22)
By imposing the divergence conditions (2.8) and (2.9) on the one-dimensional elds, one
nds that the xcomponents of the electric and magnetic elds are constant. We assume
here that the eld vectors must vanish somewhere, and hence that this constant must be
zero. For a free eld propagating in the xdirection only, the electric and magnetic elds
are both polarised purely in the yandzdirections.
The wave equation (2.22) can be factorised into a product of two, rst-order dier-
ential operators:@
@x 1
c@
@t@
@x+1
c@
@t
Oi(x;t) = 0: (2.23)26
D'Alembert's solution to the wave equation is the superposition of the solutions of these
two, rst-order dierential operators. After taking into account the allowed polarisations,
one therefore nds that the general solution for the electric eld vector propagating along
thexaxis is given by
E(x;t) =X
s=1[Eys(x;t)by+Ezs(x;t)bz] (2.24)
whereEis(x;t) satises the rst-order dierential equation
@
@x+s
c@
@t
Eis(x;t) = 0 (2.25)
for bothi=y;zands=1. Here,byandbzare unit vectors that lie parallel to the yand
zaxes respectively and are oriented in the direction of the increasing coordinate. The
solutions of this rst-order equation have a dependence on the space-time distance x sct
only:Eis(x;t) =Eis(x sct). As previously mentioned, the electric and magnetic eld
vectors are not independent of each other, but are coupled through Maxwell's equations.
For this reason, the magnetic eld vector may be calculated directly from the expression
for the electric eld in Eq. (2.24), and is given by
B(x;t) =X
s=1s
c[Eys(x;t)bz Ezs(x;t)by]: (2.26)
Eqs. (2.24) and (2.26) provide a complete set of solutions to Maxwell's equations in one-
dimensional free space. In order to determine the particular choice of Eis(x;t) satisfying
Eq. 2.25, one will need to impose a set of boundary conditions on the elds and their
time derivatives at some chosen time.
2.1.5 The solutions of Maxwell's equations in three dimensions
The most general solutions of the free-space Maxwell equations are those that have
a dependence on all spatial coordinates in addition to time. Propagation is therefore27
also permitted in any direction. When parametrised in this way, the three-dimensional
solutions E(r;t) and B(r;t) satisfy the full wave equation (2.16), which is no longer
factorisable. The simplest way to proceed is therefore to expand the eld vectors into
their Fourier representations and solve the appropriate set of equations on the Fourier
componentseE(k;t) andeB(k;t).
Consider again the wave equation (2.16) for the electric and magnetic eld vectors.
By expressing the eld vectors in their Fourier representations, given in Eq. (2.2), one
nds that the wave equation is satised when the following relation holds:

jkj2+1
c2@2
@t2
eE(k;t) = 0: (2.27)
The most general solution of this equation is
eE(k;t) =ke ict(2.28)
where the Greek letter is equal tojkj, and wherekcan be any complex 3-vector-valued
function of k. For future reference, the exponential term exp[  ict] for any positive 
is known as a positive frequency mode, whereas the complex conjugate of this term,
exp[ict], is known as a negative frequency mode.
Using Gauss's laws for the electric and magnetic elds (2.12) and (2.13) one will nd
that
kk= 0: (2.29)
This equation implies that the mode coecient kis a vector function that is polarised
in the plane orthogonal to the direction of the wave vector s=k=. Therefore,kmay
be expressed in terms of two real, three-dimensional basis vectors lying tangent to this
plane, themselves orthogonal to k. We shall denote these two basis vectors eswhere
2fH;Vgsuch thatk=P
=H;Vkes. Although other relations may be specied28
in order to dene more explicitly the particular choice of basis vectors, the following
relations shall always hold:
esHesV= 0
esHesH=esVesV= 1
esHk=esVk= 0: (2.30)
In order to determine the complete expression for the electric eld vector in three
dimensions we must piece together the original Fourier transform having found a general
solution for the Fourier coecients eE(k;t). The general electric eld solution is
E(r;t) =X
=H;VZ1
 1d3k
(2)3=2eikr ictkes+ c.c. (2.31)
Here c.c denotes the complex conjugate. Note here that because the elds are real, both
the positive- and negative-frequency modes contribute to the total eld solution. As
in Section 2.1.4, the general solution for the magnetic eld is calculated directly from
Eq. (2.31) by employing Faraday's law (2.10). The corresponding solution is
B(r;t) =1
cX
=H;VZ1
 1d3k
(2)3=2eikr ictk(ses) + c.c. (2.32)
The values for the electric and magnetic elds above provide a complete set of solutions
to Maxwell's equations in three dimensions. The remaining unknown coecient kis
specic to the particular problem being investigated and can be fully determined by a
set of initial conditions on the eld vectors across all space at a given time.
We see in the derivation of these solutions that both the electric eld and the magnetic
eld can be fully characterised by the mode coecients k. We must also be able,
therefore, to express the energy of the free eld in terms of these mode coecients. By
substituting the electric and magnetic eld vectors found in Eqs. (2.31) and (2.32) into29
the expression for the electromagnetic energy in Eq. (2.21) one nds that
Henergy = 2"0X
=H;VZ1
 1d3kjk(t)j2: (2.33)
By expanding k(t) = exp[ ict]k, one can check that the energy of the classical
eld is constant in time, as was expected.
2.1.6 The free EM eld as an harmonic oscillator
The Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics is a methodology commonly used to
determine the dynamics of a mechanical system. In this formalism, a system is char-
acterised entirely by a set of canonical position coordinates qiand an associated but
independent set of canonical momentum coordinates pi. The indices imay be either
discrete or continuous. The equations of motion for the canonical variables qiandpi
that characterise the system are given by two rst-order dierential equations of motion
known as Hamilton's equations. These are [126]
_qi=@H
@pi_pi= @H
@qi: (2.34)
In these equations, the dynamics of qiandpiare rst-order derivatives with respect to a
functionH(qi;pi;t) known as the Hamiltonian which depends on the canonical variables
and time. The Hamiltonian is given by the expression for the energy of that system.
In the previous two sections we determined the dynamics of the electric and magnetic
elds by solving Maxwell's equations explicitly. When a system is quantised, however,
it is common to begin from a Hamiltonian description of the classical system. In order
to motivate certain results and aid discussions later on, it is convenient to demonstrate
here that the free electromagnetic eld can also be expressed as a Hamiltonian system,
and that the expression for the energy of the free elds acts as the Hamiltonian for that
system.
In Section 2.1.5 it was shown by solving Maxwell's equations that the mode functions30
kare the coecients of the positive frequency modes, and therefore satisfy the equation
of motion
_k(t) +ic k(t) = 0: (2.35)
The terms k(t) are often known as normal variables as they oscillate at a single fre-
quency and therefore describe the normal modes of vibration. This equation describes
the evolution of a simple harmonic oscillator when the normal mode is related to the
position and momentum of the oscillator in the following way [123]:

oscillators that have positions qkand momenta pk. In order to demonstrate that the
energy observable is also the Hamiltonian that generates the dynamics of the system,
we must show that the dynamics of the position and momentum variables as predicted
by Hamilton's equations (2.34) are equivalent to Eq. (2.35). We must remember at this
stage that, as the canonical variables form a continuum in k, the partial derivatives in
Hamilton's equations must be replaced by functional derivatives. Having taken this into31
account, one is able to verify that
_pk= m2c2qk
_qk=pk

It is now possible, using Eq. (2.36), to show that these equations are equivalent to
Eq. (2.35).Chapter 3
The quantum theory of light
In this chapter we shall review a recent quantisation of the EM eld that provides the
standard result for the quantised free eld observables. This quantisation scheme will
provide an important set of guidelines for quantising the EM eld in position space,
which will be the topic of Chapters 4 and 5. Before we discuss this quantisation scheme
we review some of the basic principles of quantum mechanics that are preliminary to the
remainder of this thesis.
3.1 A short review of quantum mechanics
3.1.1 The Hilbert space of quantum states
Quantum states
In classical physics the state of a system is characterised by a complete set of variables
such as the canonically conjugate pair qiandpi. In quantum physics, all information
pertaining to a system is contained within the quantum mechanical state vector or wave-
function of that system. The collection of all possible state vectors spans a complex (and
possibly innite-dimensional) vector space Hknown as the Hilbert space. A common
notation that shall be adopted in this thesis will be the Dirac bra-ket notation. In this
notation, the state of a system 	 will be denoted by the ket-vector j	iwhich exists in
3233
H.
The inner product
There exists an inner product on Hilbert space such that, for any two state vectors j	i
andjiinH, their inner product, denoted in the bra-ket notation as hj	i, is a complex
number. The inner product satises the following three conditions [127]:
1. Linearity: For all j	1i;j	2i;ji2H, and for all ;2C;
hj(j	1i+j	2i) =hj	1i+hj	2i:
2. Conjugate symmetry: For all j	i;ji2H;
hj	i=h	ji:
3. Positivity: For all j	i6=02H;
h	j	i>0:(3.1)
Using this inner product it is possible for us to dene a norm for state vectors in the
Hilbert space. The norm or magnitude of a state vector j	iis given bykh	j	ik1=2
which is always real (condition 2) and positive (condition 3). When we normalise a state
vector we mean that we multiply that state vector by an overall constant such that the
magnitude of the new vector is equal to unity.
By themselves, the backwards facing vectors in the inner product above are known as
bra-vectors, and represent a single continuous mapping from points in Hto a point in
the complex plane. Like the ket-vectors, the bra-vectors also span a vector space which
in this latter case is known as the dual space H. For each ket-vector j	iin the Hilbert
space there is a unique bra-vector h	jthat exists in the dual space.
In quantum theory, the physical interpretation given to the inner product between
two statesj	iandjiinH,hj	i, is the probability amplitude for the state j	ito
transition into the state ji. The probability for this transition to take place is the real
squared magnitude of this complex probability amplitude khj ik2. This postulate is
known as the Born rule.34
3.1.2 Operators, observables and expectation values
Quantum mechanical operators
Any change of the physical state of a system will be accompanied by a corresponding
change in it's state vector. Such changes are brought about by acting on the state
vector with a quantum mechanical operator that maps the Hilbert space onto itself, for
example,A:H!H, which will map a state j	ito the new state A j	iwhereA
is always understood to act to the right. Changes of reference frame and the act of
measurement both introduce changes to the system, and are therefore represented by
operators acting on the Hilbert space.
For every operator Athere will also exist an operator Ayknown as the adjoint of A.
The adjoint of Ais dened such that
hjAj	i=h	jAyji: (3.2)
A particularly interesting set of operators are those for which A=Ay, which are known
as self-adjoint. In this thesis we shall use the expressions self-adjoint and Hermitian
interchangeably, although in general not all Hermitian operators are self-adjoint. The
eigenvalues of an Hermitian operator are always real and eigenstates with distinct eigen-
values are orthogonal under the inner product that denes the adjoint operator.
Observables
When handed a system to play with, we often want to take measurements of some relevant
quantity in that system: the electric eld, for example. When a measurement is made
on a quantum system, the possible outcomes of that measurement are the eigenvalues
of the operator that represents the particular observable being measured. After that
measurement is taken the state of the system is projected onto an eigenstate associated
with the measured outcome with a probability determined by the Born rule. As the
Hilbert space is a complex vector space, the eigenvalues of a general operator will be35
complex. The measurable outcomes of an experiment, on the other hand, must always
be real. The eigenvalues of the observable must therefore also be orthogonal to ensure
that a measurement repeated immediately will yield the same result as the rst. The class
of operators we are describing are the Hermitian operators. Consequently all observables
are represented by Hermitian operators.
Expectation values
When an observable is measured, unless the state prior to the measurement is an eigen-
state of the operator for that measurement, measurements repeated on separate identical
systems will yield dierent results that occur with a known probability. Consider re-
peating such an experiment an innite number of times, each time beginning with the
same initial state. The average of all the measured values for that particular observable
is known as the expectation value of that observable with respect to a given state. If it
is assumed that our state is initially given by the ket-vector j	i, then the expectation
value of the observable Ais given by
hAi	=h	jAj	i: (3.3)
In the classical limit of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of the measurement
of a particular observable all approach the expectation value of that observable. The ex-
pectation value of a quantum observable represents the classical value of that observable.
3.1.3 The dynamics of a quantum system
The Schr odinger equation
Between measurements a system and its corresponding state vector will naturally evolve
of their own accord. The equation of motion that determines this evolution is the36
Schr odinger equation:
i~d
dtj	(t)i=H(t)j	(t)i; (3.4)
where the constant ~=h=2is the reduced Planck's constant. In the above equation,
the operator H(t) is the Hamiltonian of the system. It acts as the generator of time
translations in a quantum system and, similar to as in the classical formalism, is equal
to the energy observable. In the particular case that the Hamiltonian is independent of
time, the solution of the Schr odinger equation is
j	(t)i=U(t;t0)j	(t0)i (3.5)
whereU(t;t0) = exp[ iH(t t0)=~] andj	(t0)iis the state at an initial time t0. The
description of a system in which the dynamics of the system is encoded within the time
dependence of state vectors is known as the Schr odinger picture.
The Heisenberg equation
When investigating the dynamics of a quantum system, our primary task will be to
calculate expectation values of dierent observables at particular times. The expectation
of an observable Acalculated with respect to a state specied at a time t, which is
calculated using Eq. (3.3), may be expressed as
h	(t0)jUy(t;t0)AU(t;t0)j	(t0)i=h	(t0)jA(t)j	(t0)i (3.6)
wheret0is some xed reference time and A=A(t0). When calculating a time-dependent
expectation value, it does not matter whether the calculation is carried out using a time-
independent operator with respect to a state evolving according to the Schr odinger equa-
tion or whether it is calculated for a time-dependent operator A(t) =Uy(t;t0)AU(t;t0)
with respect to a time-independent state j	(t0)i.37
The description of a system in which its dynamics are encoded in the operators is
known as the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics. In the Heisenberg picture, as
we have just seen, the time dependence of an operator is already specied by the time-
evolution operators U(t;t0). An equation of motion for the time-dependent operators is
therefore found by taking the time derivative of this operator. The equation of motion
for the time-dependent operator is known as Heisenberg's equation of motion and is given
by
d
dtA(t) = i
~[A(t);H(t)] (3.7)
where the commutator of two operators [ A;B] is equal to AB BA.
3.2 Quantisation of the free EM eld
3.2.1 The Hamiltonian operator
The Photon
The process of quantising the classical electromagnetic theory aims to achieve two things.
It must determine a Hilbert space that is appropriate for describing the possible quantum
states of the free radiation eld, and it must also provide us with a set of observables
that represent the electric and magnetic eld vectors that act on this Hilbert space.
There are several ways in which one may go about nding the quantised observables of
the free EM eld. Using a canonical quantisation prescription, for example, textbooks
usually obtain expressions for the basic eld observables by expanding the vector potential
Aof the classical EM eld into its Fourier components. The Fourier coecients are
then replaced by photon creation and annihilation operators with bosonic commutation
relations [128, 129, 130]. In some cases authors only consider standing waves inside a
box (see for example Refs. [69, 124, 130]). The particular method that we shall follow in
this section is the one presented by Bennett et al. [131] that considers the running wave38
solutions of Maxwell's equations which are characterised by a wave number k2R3, a
frequency!=jkjcand a polarisation 2fH;Vg. This characterisation can be traced
back to Planck's 1901 modelling of black body radiation [132] and Einstein's 1917 analysis
of the photoelectric eect [133].
It was noted in Section 2.1.6 that the Hamiltonian for the free EM eld can be
expressed as an innite collection of uncoupled harmonic oscillators with a frequency
!=c. As is well known from quantum mechanics, the energy spectrum of the quantum
harmonic oscillator consists of an innite ladder of energy eigenvalues. Each rung on
the ladder is separated from the one above and the one below by an energy spacing of
~!where!is the frequency of the oscillator. Such a spectrum is equivalent to that
for a system of many identical particles: as a particle is added or removed from the
system, we move up or down a rung on the ladder, adding or removing a xed amount
of energy. In this scheme, therefore, the initial and only assumption shall be that the
Hilbert space is spanned by a set of countable energy quanta characterised by a wave
vector kand a polarisation . Excitations of this type are known as photons and are the
basic excitations of the free EM eld.
Annihilation and creation operators
A useful notation for a state containing nphotons, each characterised by a wave vector
kiwith a corresponding polarisation i, is
jk1:::kni: (3.8)
Hereitakes all integer values between 1 and n. As photons are bosons, this state is
symmetric under a reordering of any of the ki. As states characterised by a denite k
andare eigenstates of the Hermitian energy observable, they are all orthogonal to one39
another. Consequently [134]
hk1:::knjk0
1:::k0
mi=nmX
PnY
i=1(ki k0
P(i))i;P(i)(3.9)
wherePrepresents a permutation of the set f1;:::;mgandP(i) is thei-th member of
that permutation. All permutations must be considered in this inner product to ensure
that the inner product is also unchanged under any reordering of the ki. Here(k) refers
to the Dirac delta function and nmis the Kronecker delta.
It is convenient at this stage to introduce an operator that will raise an energy ei-
genstate one rung higher on the ladder by creating a photon with a wave vector kand
polarisation . Such an operator is aptly named the creation operator and denoted ay
k.
Consider the earlier n-photon state given in Eq. (3.8). By applying the creation operator
ay
kto this state we generate the following ( n+ 1)-photon state:
ay
kjk1:::kni=jk;k1:::kni: (3.10)
Since the state is unchanged by the reordering of any ki, all creation operators commute
with one another.
The Hermitian conjugate operator of the creation operator ay
kis denotedak. Using
the denition of the adjoint operator given in Eq. (3.2) and the inner product given in
Eq. (3.9), one may show that when akis applied to the n-photon state given in Eq. (3.8),
it generates the following state:
akjk1:::kni=nX
i=1(k ki); ijk1:::ki 1;ki+1:::kni: (3.11)
The resulting state contains exactly n 1 photons. The operator akhas moved the
state down one rung of the ladder by removing one photon creating an ( n 1)-photon
energy eigenstate. For this reason, they are referred to as annihilation operators. As the
nal state on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.11) is unchanged by the reordering of ki, all40
annihilation operators commute with one another.
Since every time a photon is removed the total energy of the system drops, to ensure
that the energy is bounded below we must assume that there comes a point when we
reach a lowest energy state that is destroyed by all annihilation operators. Such a state
is known as the vacuum state and denoted j0i: the state containing no photons. In order
to satisfy the conditions of a vacuum state we insist that akj0i= 0 for all kand. It
is assumed that the vacuum state is normalised to unity: h0j0i= 1.
In Eq. (3.10), we dened a set of creation operators that add a single photon to a
state. As we now have a vacuum state j0ithat has been shown to contain exactly no
photons, we can construct states containing any number of photons we like by applying
the creation operators repeatedly to the vacuum state. We refer to states containing a
specic number of photons as number states. A state containing nidentical photons is
denoted
jnki=1p
n!ay
knj0i: (3.12)
Thejnkistate contains nphotons that have a wave vector kand are polarised in the 
direction. We refer to this state as an n-photon state.
Using Eqs. (3.10) and (3.11), one is able to show by direct calculation that the
commutator between an annihilation and creation operator satises the relation
h
ak;ay
k00i
jk1:::kni=(k k0);0jk1:::kni: (3.13)
Consequently, we nd that
h
ak;ay
k0i
=(k k0);0id (3.14)
where id is the identity operator. Since this commutator is proportional to the identity
operator, I shall drop the id and treat the commutator as simply a number, in which41
case it may be shown that
h1kj1k00i=h
ak;ay
k00i
: (3.15)
In future we shall use this denition to dene the commutator between creation and
annihilation operators.
The Hamiltonian observable
In standard descriptions of the quantised EM eld [69, 123, 124, 130, 131], the energy
observable is given by the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian for a collection of uncoupled
oscillators. We can understand this result in terms of the discussion on the photon at the
beginning of this section. This operator can be expressed in terms of the photon creation
and annihilation operators in the following way:
H(t) =X
=1;2Z
R3d3k~jkjcay
kak+HZPE: (3.16)
TheHZPEterm is a further numerical term that is, as yet, unknown to us. It represents
the zero-point energy of the system, which is the energy of the vacuum state. It acts
to simultaneously shift the energy of all ( k;) states by a xed amount. The zero-point
energy does not play a role in determining the dynamics of a state or any observables,
but it does still contribute to many important and observable eects, as shall be seen
in Chapter 7 of this thesis. One may check, using Eqs. (3.12) and (3.14), that the
photon number states are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian observable and have eigenvalues
n~jkjc+HZPE, as expected.
3.2.2 Photon wave packets
Single-photon wave packets
In the context of linear optics experiments [135, 136, 137, 138, 139], it is usual to talk
about single photons when referring to particles whose state vectors j1ican be expressed42
asj1i=ayj0iwhereais an annihilation operator that satises the commutation relation
h
a;ayi
= 1: (3.17)
The single-photon states j1kidened in the previous section, however, are not normal-
isable. The annihilation operator acan be constructed by linearly superposing a number
of the k-dependent annihilation operators akin the following way
a=X
=H;VZ
R3d3k 

with complex coecients  
k. When the wave packet coecients satisfy the normalisa-
tion condition
X
=H;VZ
R3d3kj kj2= 1 (3.19)
the statej1iis normalised and Eq. (3.17) is satised.
Many-photon wave packets
Quantum states of light, such as the single-photon state above, are not restricted to
contain only one photon, but may contain any number of photons we like. A many-
photon state may be constructed in the following way:
j i=1X
n=0cnp
n!aynj0i (3.20)
whereayis the Hermitian conjugate of adened in Eq. (3.18). This state is a superposi-
tion of states containing precisely na-photons for all positive integers n. The contribution
of thennumber state to the total state j iis determined by the coecient cn. Using
the commutation relation given above in Eq. (3.17), one can verify that the state j iis
normalised when the coecients cnare chosen such thatP1
n=0jcnj2= 1. The statej i43
is not the most general many-photon state that may be constructed, but there will be
no need to construct more general states in this thesis.
Coherent wave packets
One possible choice for the normalised coecients cnis
cn= e jj2=2n(3.21)
for a complex number . For this particular choice of cn, the statej icorresponds to
the coherent state jiof a short laser pulse. Coherent states are minimal uncertainty
quantum states that do not exhibit correlations of any order [140]. They are also the
eigenstates of the annihilation operators. Consider the annihilation operator afor a
normalised single-photon wave packet as dened in Eq. (3.18). A coherent wave packet
jisatises the eigenstate equation
aji=ji: (3.22)
This equation may be veried using Eqs. (3.17), (3.20) and (3.21). Hence, a coherent
state is an innite superposition of all possible number states.
It is convenient to express the state jiin terms of an operator D() that generates
jifrom the vacuum state:
ji=D()j0i=e(ay a)j0i=e 1
2jj21X
n=1n
n!aynj0i: (3.23)
The operator D() is known as the displacement operator and is unitary: D()Dy() =
id.44
3.2.3 The electric and magnetic eld observables
An ansatz for the eld observables
In Section 2.1.3 we demonstrated that the energy of the EM eld is quadratic in both the
electric and magnetic elds. In Section 3.2.1 we also found that the energy observable
is quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators ay
kandak. A suitable ansatz
for the electric and magnetic elds therefore is one that is linear in both the annihilation
and creation operators. For simplicity we shall only follow the quantisation procedure
for one-dimensional elds, and state the three-dimensional result towards the end. In
the one-dimensional system, the wave vector k=kbxis characterised by its magnitude
and its sign swhich takes the value s=Lfor left-propagating light and s=Rfor
right-propagating light. The one-dimensional electric and magnetic eld observables in
the Heisenberg picture are given by
E(x;t) =X
=H;VX
s=L;RZ1
0dp
2fs(x;t;)ay
s()es+ H.c. (3.24)
B(x;t) =X
=H;VX
s=L;RZ1
0dp
2gs(x;t;)ay
s()es+ H.c. (3.25)
Here the coecients fs(x;t;) andgs(x;t;) are complex and H.c. denotes the Her-
mitian conjugate. As this is a one-dimensional solution we shall assume that esH=by
andesV=bz.
Field dynamics
In the Heisenberg picture, quantum mechanical operators evolve according to the Heisen-
berg equation (3.7). As was the case in the classical system, the energy observable (3.16)
is the generator of time translations, which now appears in the Heisenberg equation. By
substituting the expression for the electric eld observable (3.24) and the Hamiltonian45
observable into the Heisenberg equation one nds that
@fs(x;t;)
@t=icfs(x;t;): (3.26)
By following the same process for the magnetic eld one will nd an identical equation
for thegs(x;t;) coecients. The solutions of these equations are
fs(x;t;) =eictfs(x;)
gs(x;t;) =eictgs(x;) (3.27)
wherefs(x;) andgs(x;) are two time-independent functions left to be determined.
One may notice that the annihilation and creation operators evolve just like the normal
variables in the classical theory. In the quantised theory, in which the classical electric
and magnetic elds become operators acting on the Hilbert space, one could say that
the normal variables kand their complex conjugates are promoted to annihilation and
creation operators respectively. Note in particular, however, that in contrast to the real
classical solutions of Maxwell's equations, the evolution of the photon creation operators
is determined by the negative-frequency modes only.
Maxwell's equations
In the quantised theory, the expectation values of the electric and magnetic eld observ-
ables calculated with respect to any normalised state are assumed to evolve according to
Maxwell's equations. As all space and time dependence is contained within the observ-
ables, we may equivalently demand that the eld observables themselves obey Maxwell's
equations. By substituting the eld observables (3.24) and (3.25) into the free-space Max-
well's equations and solving these equations, taking into account the time dependence of46
thefs(x;t;) andgs(x;t;) coecients, one will nd that
fs(x;) =eixf(1)

R() (3.28)
gs(x;) =1

Rp()o
(3.29)
where6=p. Here the positive sign applies when =Hand the negative sign when
=V. As the eld associated with a right-propagating photon must be a function of
x ctonly, andx+ctfor a left-propagating photon, we have already established that
f(1)
Randf(2)
Lequal zero.
The electric and magnetic eld observables
By solving Heisenberg's equation and Maxwell's equations we have determined the com-
plete expressions for the electric and magnetic eld observables up to the two remaining
- and-dependent terms f(1)
L() andf(2)
R(). To determine these factors, it is necessary
only to substitute the eld observables into the expression for the eld energy (2.21) and
equate the resulting operator with the Hamiltonian observable (3.16). Having performed
this calculation one nds that the eld energy and the Hamiltonian observable exactly
coincide when

whereAis the cross-sectional area inhabited by the eld in the plane perpendicular to

overall phase.
Putting the results of this section together, we have, up to an overall phase, a set of47
observables for the electric and magnetic eld vectors. These are

wherep6=and the positive sign applies when =Hand the negative sign when
=V. Now that we have a set of observables for the electric and magnetic elds, and
therefore are able to calculate the energy observable exactly using Eq. (2.21), we may
also determine the value of the HZPEleft unspecied earlier. We nd that this zero-point
energy is
HZPE=Z1

which is innite.
If one proceeds in a similar manner, making rst the assumption that the Hamiltonian
is given by Eq. (3.16), one is able to show that the three-dimensional electric and magnetic

A local quantisation of the free
radiation eld
48Chapter 4
Local photons in one dimension
In this chapter we construct an alternative quantisation for the free EM eld in one di-
mension in both the position and momentum representations. Analogous to the classical
solutions of the free-space Maxwell's equations in one dimension, in this chapter the basic
quanta of the EM eld are localised particles that propagate along a single axis at the
speed of light in a xed direction without dispersion. We motivate these excitations in
Section 4.1 by considering the evolution of localised wave packets that are propagating in
opposite directions. Later, in Section 4.2, we describe their basic properties, develop an
appropriate equation of motion for these localised particles, and determine expressions
for the related electric and magnetic eld observables. We also derive a Hamiltonian for
these particles that evolves the system according to the Schr odinger equation. As in the
standard theory, by writing the equation of motion of the system in this way we can more
easily introduce interactions in future if desired. Moreover, by having a Hamiltonian for
the new system we can more easily compare our approach with standard quantum optical
approaches. In Section 4.3 we examine these same particles and the associated eld ob-
servables in their momentum representation, which we then compare in Section 4.4 with
the standard quantisation of the free EM eld. We end this chapter with a discussion in
Section 4.5.

4.1 Introduction: The importance of a complete Hilbert
space
In Chapter 3 we summarised a recent quantisation scheme for the free EM eld which
describes a system of energy quanta characterised by a wave vector kand a polarisation 
[131]. This approach assumed that the electric and magnetic eld observables were linear
in the photon creation and annihilation operators, and then found the complete solutions
by rst solving Maxwell's equations and afterwards making sure that the photons had
the correct energy. This quantisation scheme has some similarities with that of Ornigotti
et al. [141] which quantises a paraxial electromagnetic eld in a dispersive medium. Here
the eld is quantised in a basis of orthogonal, orbital angular momentum carrying X
waves [142] which, like the monochromatic plane waves, have an innite norm. Aiello
[143, 144] recently also obtained a non-standard description of the EM eld by quantising
the monochromatic solutions of the paraxial wave equation for light in free space.
The purpose of this section is, by using the approach of Bennett et al., to quantise the
one-dimensional free electromagnetic eld in terms of localised and causally propagating
particles. From our discussion in the introduction, we have seen that there are dierent
ways in which one may go about constructing locally orthogonal single-photon wave
packets. In this chapter, however, we quantise a set of locally bosonic particles that
are distinct from the elds, and may instead be viewed as carriers of the elds. The
corresponding electric and magnetic eld observables in this system will also be derived.
The theorems of Hegerfeldt [72] and Malament [73] have also proven that localised states
do not propagate in a way that would be expected for a short light pulse. To avoid the
consequences of Hegerfeldt's theorem, in this chapter we nd that we must quantise both
the positive- and negative-frequency solutions of Maxwell's equations, thus doubling the
usual Hilbert space.
It is possible to demonstrate this result with a simple thought experiment. Consider
the two scenarios depicted in Fig. 4.1. In the rst scenario (part (a) of Fig. 4.1), a right-51
x-a 0

Figure 4.1: The gure shows two dierent scenarios in which a single-photon wave packet
travels at the speed of light in a well-dened direction. (a) Here a wave packet initially
localised around the point x= apropagates to the right. (b) Here a wave packet
initially localised around the point x=apropagates to the left. At t= 0 both wave
packets are easily distinguishable and occupy distinct sections of the real line. At t=a=c
both wave packets reach the point x= 0 and in both scenarios the wave packets appear
to be the same.
moving single-photon wave packet with an initial wave function  1(x;0) is placed near
the pointx= a. In the second scenario (part (b) of Fig. 4.1), a similar left-moving
single-photon wave packet with an initial wave function  2(x;0) is placed near the point
x=a. If the two wave packets have the same shape, then it must follow that
 1(x;0) =ei' 2(x+ 2a;0) (4.1)
where'denotes a general phase. This statement ensures, using the Born rule, that the
probability of nding the rst photon at xis the same as nding the second photon at
x+ 2a. Furthermore, if the two wave packets do not overlap each other then they are
easily distinguishable and their state vectors are pairwise orthogonal:
h 1(0)j 2(0)i= 0: (4.2)
Let us assume that a quantum state evolves unitarily with a time-evolution operator
U(t;0) whereUy(t;0)U(t;0) = id. From Eq. (4.2) it follows that the overlap of the two
state vectorsj 1(t)iandj 2(t)iremains zero at all times:
h 1(t)j 2(t)i=h 1(0)jUy(t;0)U(t;0)j 2(0)i=h 1(0)j 2(0)i= 0: (4.3)52
This cannot be the case, however, as at a time t=a=cthe two wave packets overlap and
are no longer distinguishable. At this time, the two wave functions dier by at most a
phase factor since
 1(x;t) = 1(x ct;0) =ei' 2(x ct+ 2a;0) =ei' 2(x;t): (4.4)
If Eq. (4.3) holds at all times, then the quantum states of wave packets travelling to the
left and to the right must belong to separate Hilbert spaces. This means that particle
wave packets must be characterised by an additional degree of freedom: their direction
of propagation.
In the following, we therefore distinguish two dierent types of photon by introducing
a parameter s=1 to signify a direction of propagation where s= 1 indicates right-
moving wave packets and s= 1 indicates left-moving wave packets. Now the states for
wave packets travelling in opposite directions remain orthogonal at all times. Although
in this thesis we are specically concerned with photons, in principle the above argument,
which justies the introduction of an additional parameter s, would also apply to localised
wave packets of any other particle type. The problem raised by the argument above,
however, is much more obvious in the case of photons. Since photons are massless, they
must always propagate at the speed of light. It is not possible, therefore, by means of
a Lorentz transformation, to slow down and reverse the direction of a photon in one-
dimension. On the other hand, for massive particles, e.g, the electron, a change of
reference frame can always be made that slows the electron to a stop and then sends
it in the opposite direction. In this way a connection can be established between the
right-propagating and left-propagating states. For photons there is no such connection
and right-propagating and left-propagating wave packets must therefore inhabit distinct
regions of the Hilbert space.
One should also notice that photons with a well-dened direction of propagation53
travel at the speed of light. It follows, therefore, that
 s(x;t) = s(x sct;0): (4.5)
By expressing the above photon wave function as a Fourier transform of the momentum-
dependent wave function e s(k;t) one can show that
Z1
 1dke s(k;t)eikx=Z1
 1dke s(k;0)eik(x sct): (4.6)
Since this relation holds for wave packets of any shape it is implied that
e s(k;t) =e s(k;0)eiskct(4.7)
for alls,kand. As we have seen in Section 3.2.3, these dynamics can be generated by
the Schr odinger equation for a collection of uncoupled harmonic oscillators, each oscillator
characterised by a set of parameters k,ands.
We can see from Eq. (4.7) that, as was also observed in Ref. [110], when the dynamics
of the state  s(x;t) evolves according to the Schr odinger equation dened in Eq. (3.4),
the corresponding Hamiltonian must have eigenvalues skc. We also know from Eq. (4.6)
that the wave number kmust take all real values in order to localise the initial wave
packet illustrated in Fig. 4.1. In addition, kmust be independent of sto ensure that
the direction of propagation can be chosen freely for any wave packet. The eigenstates
of this Hamiltonian, therefore, are not bounded either from above or below, and they
must take all real values. In standard quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian appearing in
the Schr odinger equation (3.4) is given by the energy observable of the system being de-
scribed. It is strictly necessary that the eigenvalues of the energy observable have a lower
bound in order to ensure that the system cannot be used as a source of innite energy.
This can only be guaranteed when the direction of propagation sand the orientation of
kcoincide. This would mean that the two are no longer independent.54
The argument presented above demonstrates that there is a contradiction between
the current theory of the quantised EM eld (see for example Refs. [123, 124, 130]) and
a theory that would allow us to construct quantised descriptions of all possible solutions
to Maxwell's equations. As we have seen in Section 2.1.4, these include localised wave
packets that propagate at the speed of light without dispersion. More precisely, the
propagation of localised photon wave packets in a given direction, like those depicted
in Fig. 4.1, cannot be described by the unitary evolution of photons characterised by a
wave number k, a polarisation and a positive frequency !, as is the case in the current
theory. Hence we nd that a more complete description of the quantised EM eld is
required that considers states that evolve with negative frequencies, in addition to the
usual positive-frequency states. Within this new description, the dynamical Hamiltonian
of the system, which always has both positive and negative eigenvalues, can no longer
coincide with the energy observable of the EM eld, which must always be positive.
From the discussion above we see that when a source emits a localised wave packet it
must emit a series of monochromatic waves oscillating with both positive and negative
frequencies, which are later absorbed by the receiver. This model bears a resemblance to
Cramer's transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics [145]. In Cramer's descrip-
tion, the emitter of a particle emits positive-frequency waves forwards in time towards the
absorber, but also negative-frequency excitations backwards in time. The total process
is time symmetric. The absorber of the particle also emits positive-frequency waves for-
wards in time and negative-frequency waves backwards in time towards the emitter, again
in an overall time-symmetric process. These waves interfere leaving only a single particle
propagating from the emitter towards the absorber. In this thesis, both positive- and
negative-frequency photons are required to generate the correct interference to produce
a localised, non-dispersive wave packet with a xed direction of propagation. Although
here we do not think of the negative-frequency modes as propagating backwards in time
from the emitter, this interpretation is adopted in, for instance, Ref. [146].
In the remainder of this chapter these considerations are taken into account as we55
investigate an alternative approach to quantising the free one-dimensional EM eld. Our
starting point for this approach will be the assumption that, like the classical solutions of
Maxwell's equations given in Eqs. (2.24) and (2.26), single-photon states can be localised
and travel at the speed of light without dispersion. Like Mandel [68, 69] and Cook [66, 67],
in this chapter and the next we shall assume that particles are localised when they are
orthogonal to one another under the usual inner product of quantum mechanics. This
assumption allows us to avoid the need for biorthogonal quantum physics [55]. Insisting
that localised states are orthogonal to one another also implies that the annihilation
and creation operators obey bosonic commutation relations. This is in good agreement
with linear optics experiments with ultra-broadband photons, which conrms the bosonic
nature of these localised particles [147, 148, 149, 150].
4.2 Quantisation in position space
In this section we introduce the annihilation and creation operators for a set of locally
bosonic particles that are characterised by the additional degree of freedom s. We de-
termine the commutation properties of these particles and their fundamental equation of
motion in addition to dening an appropriate set of eld observables in terms of these
operators. We nd in this section that the eld observables are non-locally related to
the particle states and that the transformation between the two must be implemented
by means of a regularisation operator. We discuss this operator more in Section 4.3.
Towards the end of this section we determine the energy observable of the system and
construct the generator for time translations that appears in Schr odinger's equation. As
mentioned in Section 4.1, we nd that the two are not the same.56
4.2.1 A new Hilbert Space
Blip states
In the past we have assumed that the basic building blocks of the EM eld are the
monochromatic photon states. Let us now take a dierent approach and assume that
the fundamental excitations are a set of spatially localised particle states that propagate
along thexaxis of a Cartesian coordinate system. We shall call these localised excitations
blips, which is an abbreviation of the name \bosons localised in position." At any given
timet, a blip state can be fully characterised by its position xalong thexaxis, a
polarisation and a direction of propagation s. Herestakes values1 withs= +1
indicating propagation in the direction of increasing xands= 1 indicating propagation
in the direction of decreasing x. As is usual in one dimension, =H;V.
Annihilation and creation operators
As in Chapter 3, we may dene a set of annihilation operators for the blip states. We shall
denote these operators as(x;t) in the Heisenberg picture and as(x;0) in the Schr odinger
picture. To identify a Hilbert space, we proceed as before and rst dene a vacuum state
j0ifor this system. The vacuum state is the lowest energy state and is annihilated by all
annihilation operators as(x;t) for anyx,t,sand:
as(x;t)j0i= 0: (4.8)
The vacuum state is normalised such that h0j0i= 1.
The Hermitian conjugate of as(x;t),ay
s(x;t), is the creation operator that generates
a single blip excitation when applied to the vacuum state:
j1s(x;t)i=ay
s(x;t)j0i: (4.9)
These states span the single-particle Hilbert space. The total Hilbert space is a symmetric57
Fock space of such Hilbert spaces. Accordingly, by applying blip creation operators to the
vacuum state repeatedly we are able to generate a complete set of multi-particle states.
In general, a state containing nidentical blips localised at a position x, propagating in
thesdirection and carrying a polarisation is denoted
jns(x;t)i=1p
n!ay
s(x;t)nj0i: (4.10)
A fundamental equation of motion
In Chapter 3, the dynamics of the quantised eld observables were calculated using
Heisenberg's equation of motion. This was a very straightforward procedure because the
monochromatic photon states are the eigenstates of the energy observable that generates
the dynamics of the system. The blip states, on the other hand, have a well dened
position in space and time, and Heisenberg's uncertainty relation would tell us that their
momenta and energies are completely unknown. Consequently, at this stage we cannot
carry out a similar set of calculations to determine the time dependence of the blip states.
Fortunately, we may determine their dynamics by another method.
Blip states represent the localised excitations of the EM eld that propagate at the
speed of light. This assumption places a constraint on the expectation values of the EM
elds at dierent times to ensure propagation at a constant speed, which is given by
has(x;t)i=has(x sct;0)i. Since this relation holds for any time-independent state
we can deduce the following relation:
as(x;t) =as(x sct;0): (4.11)
This equality asserts that, when allowed to propagate freely, a blip state placed at a
positionxat a timet= 0 will be found at a position x+sctat the later time t. Rather
than invoking Heisenberg's equation, we are able to determine the equation of motion for
a blip state using the above condition. By taking the time derivative of the blip operator58
in Eq. (4.11) one may show that
d
dtas(x;t) = scd
dxas(x;t): (4.12)
This is the fundamental equation of motion for the blip operators. This equation tells
us that the blip operators are constant along the light-cones dened by the coordinates
x=sct, which is in agreement with the expected behaviour illustrated in Fig. 1.3.
4.2.2 The blip commutation relations
Bosonic commutation relations
Blips are bosons, and the states that represent them, therefore, are unchanged when an
exchange of blips takes place. Hence, we assume in the following that
h
as(x;t);as00(x0;t0)i
=h
ay
s(x;t);ay
s00(x0;t0)i
= 0: (4.13)
Using the denition of a blip state in Eq. (4.9), it is possible to show that the commutation
relation between a blip creation and annihilation operator is identical to the inner product
between two single-blip states:
h1s(x;t)j1s00(x0;t0)i=h0jas(x;t)ay
s00(x0;t0)j0i
=h
as(x;t);ay
s00(x0;t0)i
: (4.14)
Orthogonal states
Single-blip states dened at dierent positions at a xed time are orthogonal to one
another. This is a necessary condition for a correct interpretation of a quantum state
as it means a localised state found at one position has no chance of being found else-
where. In the following we shall assume that such states are orthogonal under the usual
inner product of quantum mechanics in order to avoid the unnecessary complexities of
biorthogonal physics [55]. Polarisation, we know, is a measurable quantity, but, as was59
shown before, to eectively model the dynamics of a state we must also consider sas an
additional parameter. Blip states characterised by dierent sandmust therefore be
orthogonal. Hence, in the following we demand that
h1s(x;t)j1s00(x0;t0)i
=h1s(x sct;0)j1s00(x0 s0ct0;0)i
=s 
(x sct) (x0 s0ct0)
s;s0;0 (4.15)
where thes(x x0) is given by
s(x x0) =1
2Z1
 1dkeisk(x x0): (4.16)
Although not strictly necessary, in the above we choose to add a factor of sinto the
exponent so that a change in the direction of propagation ( s7! s) leads to the reversal
of the exponent, as was the case for the Fourier transforms in Section 3.2.3.
The above inner product is a good choice because it is strictly positive, translation-
invariant, symmetric with respect to the position of the blips and real valued. There
is also a unit probability of nding the blip within (  1;1). Furthermore, s(x x0)
depends on xandx0, but not on sor, as one would expect. The reason for the additional
slabel in Eq. (4.16) is to ensure that the s= 1 and the s= 1 cases do not become
formally the same. Hence, we nd that at equal times

as(x);ay
s00(x0)
=s(x x0)s;s0;0; (4.17)
which is the expected bosonic commutation relation.60
4.2.3 Field observables in the position representation
Field observables
In Section 4.2.1, we constructed a new Hilbert space spanned by the blip number states
dened in Eq. (4.10). Next we shall obtain a set of expressions for the (complex) eld
observables E(x;t) and B(x;t), and the energy observable Henergy (t) in the position rep-
resentation. As was shown in Section 2.1.4, the classical solutions of Maxwell's equations
in one dimension obey the blip equation of motion (4.12). Consequently, like the blips,
the solutions of Maxwell's equations in a vacuum are wave packets which travel at the
speed of light along the xaxis. Hence, in the following we postulate that the observables
of the complex vectors E(x;t) and B(x;t) are given by
E(x;t) =X
s=1cfR[asH] (x;t)by+R[asV] (x;t)bzg;
B(x;t) =X
s=1sfR[asH] (x;t)bz R[asV] (x;t)byg: (4.18)
The role ofRwill be discussed below and is included here to ensure that the Lorentz
covariance of the eld observables can be preserved. The above operators are non-
Hermitian, and their expectation values are complex by construction. Here the actual
eld observables are given by the real combination (1 =2) 
O+Oy
where O=E;B.
The regularisation operator
In Eq. (4.18),Ris a symmetric and translation-invariant superoperator that we shall
refer to as the regularisation operator. We shall determine the explicit form of Rlater in
this section.Rcan be understood as a distribution that acts on the annihilation operator
as(x;t) in such a way that
Rh
asi
(x;t) =Z1
 1dx0Rs(x x0)as(x0;t): (4.19)61
Similarly,Rh
ay
si
(x;t) is dened such that
Rh
ay
si
(x;t) =Z1
 1dx0R
s(x x0)ay
s(x0;t): (4.20)
The purpose of this distribution is to relate the measurable eld observables to a local
particle in a possibly non-local way. Without this regularisation it would not be possible
later on to assign an energy ~!to each photon. In this way, we distinguish between
localised blip excitations and the excitations of the eld observables. This is in contrast
to Refs. [43, 44, 50, 55, 151]. As the Rsuperoperator is translation invariant, both
the eld observables and the blip states that propagate in a xed direction satisfy the
equation of motion given in Eq. (4.12). It is then possible to show that the observables
(4.18), and their expectation values, obey the free-space Maxwell equations. Symmetry
ofR(x x0) is assumed because, although their direction of propagation will be reversed,
a parity transformation will only displace a blip and not change its shape. It is therefore
important that the electric and magnetic elds associated with a single-blip state also
only undergo a change of direction and a translation under a parity transformation. This
is ensured by the symmetry of R(x x0).
Field commutation relations
Using the expressions for the eld observables in Eq. (4.18) it is possible to show that all
components of the eld observables commute with one another:

Oi(x;t);Pj(x0;t)
= 0; (4.21)
whereOi(x;t) andPj(x;t) are any two components of the electric and magnetic eld vec-
tors. When the direction of propagation is known, the electric and magnetic elds dier
by only a rotation and a constant c. It follows therefore that whenever the electric eld
is known, so is the magnetic eld. Many quantisation schemes produce eld observables
that do not commute [123, 152]. By introducing the parameter s, in our scheme the eld62
observables are guaranteed to commute. Notice also that this means that single-photon
states can now be localised in the sense of Knight [47] and Licht [48, 49], [50].
The energy observable
To determine the energy observable in terms of the blip creation and annihilation oper-
ators we proceed as in Section 3.2.3 and substitute the eld observables (4.18) into the
expression for the classical energy (2.21). The resulting expression is
Henergy (t)
=X
s=1X
=H;V"0Ac2
4Z1
 1dx
R[as] (x;t) + H:c:	2: (4.22)
ThusRdetermines the energy of a single-blip state. Most importantly, notice that
because of the quadratic form of this observable, energy expectation values are always
positive, just as they are in classical electrodynamics.
4.2.4 The dynamical Hamiltonian
In this nal subsection we would like to show that the equation of motion for a blip
operator, given in Eq. (4.12), can be written as a Schr odinger equation. In particular
we would like to show that the eld observables O(x;t) evolve in the Heisenberg picture
according to Heisenberg's equation of motion,
d
dtO(x;t) = i
~[O(x;t);Hdyn(t)]; (4.23)
for some dynamical Hamiltonian Hdyn. Heisenberg's equation of motion is the most
important tool we have for determining the dynamics of more complex interacting sys-
tems, and it is important therefore to establish a Hamiltonian formalism for the free eld
dynamics so that interactions can be added if needed.
In the following we shall deduce the dynamical Hamiltonian Hdyn(t) using the blip
equation of motion (4.12). Consider initially Heisenberg's equation of motion for the63
operatoras(x;t). In this case, Eq. (4.23) leads us to the relation
d
dtas(x;t) = i
~[as(x;t);Hdyn(t)]: (4.24)
What is interesting about the blip annihilation operators is that their equation of motion
is already known to us from Eq. (4.12). We may therefore replace the time derivative
on the left-hand side of this equation with a space derivative. Heisenberg's equation is
rewritten
d
dxas(x;t) =is
~c[as(x;t);Hdyn(t)]: (4.25)
The above equation of motion suggests that the dynamical Hamiltonian aects the po-
sition, but not the time coordinate, of as(x;t). This is not surprising: the purpose
ofHdyn(t) is to propagate wave packets at the speed of light along the xaxis. As the
generator of such dynamics, the Hamiltonian must continuously annihilate blips while
simultaneously replacing them with excitations of equal amplitudes at nearby positions.
Taking this into account, we may construct an exchange Hamiltonian for blips at
dierent locations. A Hamiltonian of this type is given by
Hdyn(t) =X
s=1X
=H;VZ1
 1dx0Z1
 1dx00~scfs(x00;x0)
ay
s(x00;t)as(x0;t); (4.26)
wherefs(x00;x0) is a complex term left to be determined. By substituting the Hamilto-
nian (4.26) into our modied Heisenberg's equation (4.25) one will nd that
d
dxas(x;t) = iZ1
 1dx0fs(x;x0)as(x0;t): (4.27)64
One is then able to verify that
fs(x;x0) =1
2Z1
 1dkskeisk(x x0)
= id
dx1
2Z1
 1dkeisk(x x0)
= i0
s(x x0) (4.28)
where0
s(x x0) denotes the derivative of the delta function s(x x0) with respect to
x. Overall, the dynamical Hamiltonian in Eq. (4.26) equals
Hdyn(t) =X
s=1X
=H;VZ1
 1dx0Z1
 1dx00Z1
 1dk~ck
2
eisk(x00 x0)ay
s(x00;t)as(x0;t): (4.29)
This Hamiltonian is Hermitian and therefore a generator of unitary dynamics. It also
satises a number of relevant properties. For example, fs(x x0) is antisymmetric under
an exchange of xandx0. This means that a state that propagates from xtox0will only
propagate from x0toxif eithersis reversed or time is reversed. It also means that
one blip cannot be replaced by another at the same position or, in other words, that
stationary photons do not exist. The function fs(x x0) is also translation invariant,
which means that blips propagate identically at all positions, as would be expected in
free space.
Unlike the energy observable, the dynamical Hamiltonian (4.29) has both positive
and negative eigenvalues as was shown in the introduction to this chapter. Usually the
dynamical Hamiltonian and energy observable are equal; this is no longer the case. More
will be said on this in Section 4.5, but at this moment it is necessary for us only to check
that the energy of the system is conserved. According to Heisenberg's equation, the
observable for a conserved quantity commutes with the dynamical Hamiltonian. When
the dynamical Hamiltonian and energy observable coincide, this property is ensured
automatically because all observables commute with themselves. We must now check65
that
[Henergy (t);Hdyn(t)] = 0: (4.30)
Owing to the symmetry of the distribution R(x x0) and the antisymmetry of fs(x;x0),
one can show that the commutator indeed vanishes.
In the next section, where we look at this new quantisation in the momentum rep-
resentation, we will see that the dynamical Hamiltonian (4.29) takes a simpler and more
recognisable form. Moreover we shall see that when restricted to a subset of parameters,
the dynamical Hamiltonian (4.29) and the energy observable (4.22) coincide both with
each other and the standard energy observable (3.16).
4.3 Quantisation in momentum space
In classical electrodynamics, the position and momentum representations of the EM eld
complement each other well, and we may use either representation interchangeably for our
convenience. For example, we often describe light scattering experiments using Maxwell's
equations, which involve only local eld amplitudes. In such situations, it might be best to
use the position representation. In other situations, classical electrodynamics introduces
optical Green's functions and decomposes the EM eld into monochromatic waves to
predict general optical properties [153, 154]. Here a momentum space description might
be more convenient.
The purpose of this section is to construct a momentum-dependent representation of
the free quantised EM eld described in Section 4.2. We shall approach this problem
analogously by rst dening the set of monochromatic states in the blip Hilbert space,
and then afterwards construct the eld and energy observables and determine a dynam-
ical Hamiltonian. In addition to providing us with a more complete formulation of the
quantised EM eld, by investigating the momentum representation, in Section 4.4 we
shall be able to examine more closely the relationship between standard quantum optics66
descriptions of the quantised EM eld [131] and that given in Section 4.2.
4.3.1 A photon Hilbert space
Annihilation and creation operators
From classical electrodynamics we know that the set of travelling waves with wave num-
bersk2( 1;1) and two dierent polarisations 2fH;Vgprovide a complete set of
solutions to Maxwell's equations in one dimension. Therefore, in the momentum rep-
resentation, we usually express the quantised EM eld in terms of the single-photon
annihilation operators ak(t) wherekandrefer to the wave number and polarisation of
the photon respectively. By applying a Fourier transform to the blip operators as(x;t),
dened in Section 4.2.1, however, we obtain the operators eas(k;t). In the following we
assume that the operators
eas(k;t) =Z1
 1dxp
2e iskxas(x;t) (4.31)
represent the annihilation operators of monochromatic photons. The inverse transform-
ation is given by
as(x;t) =Z1
 1dkp
2eiskxeas(k;t): (4.32)
In the above the operators eas(k;t) are characterised by k2( 1;1),2fH;Vg, but
now also, like the blip states, an additional parameter s2f+1; 1g. As pointed out in
Section 4.2, the EM eld introduced in this thesis requires a Hilbert space that is doubled
when compared to the standard description of the quantised EM eld.
Usually for light propagating along a single axis, the wave number kis thexcompon-
ent of the wave vector oriented in the direction of propagation. In Eqs. (4.31) and (4.32)
we adopt the alternative convention that the wave number is given by the factor ks. As
before, this means that a change in the direction of propagation, that is, replacing s
with s, results in a change in the sign of the wave number. The parameter k, however,
then loses its traditional interpretation as being oriented in the direction of propaga-67
tion. Nevertheless, to ensure that Eq. (4.31) is invertible, kmust take all values along
the real line [155]. Another consequence of this change is that left- and right-moving
wave packets have dierent Fourier decompositions in momentum space, even if the wave
packets are the same shape. This later enables us to predict dierent dynamics for left-
and right-moving wave packets without having to introduce more than one equation of
motion.
In the following we refer to the states obtained by applying the operator eay
s(k;t)
to the vacuum state as photon states. The single-photon Hilbert space is spanned by
the statesay
s(k;t)j0ifor alls,kand. These photon states are not exactly the same
as those dened in standard theories however. For example, the operators eas(k;t) and
ea s( k;t) both describe photons whose coherent states have exactly the same electric
eld expectation values. The two operators evolve with dierent dynamics, however,
and whereas the eas(k;t) operators describes photons propagating in the sdirection,
theea s( k;t) operators describe photons propagating in the  sdirection. Although
the standard akoperators can be used to construct wave packets with electric eld
expectation values of any shape, they cannot be used to construct localised wave packets
of an arbitrary shape that propagate at the speed of light in a xed direction.
Photon states
To construct the relevant Hilbert space of the quantised EM eld, we start again by
dening a vacuum state j0i. Applying any annihilation operator to the vacuum state
destroys the state:
eas(k;t)j0i= 0: (4.33)
By applying both the left- and right-hand sides of Eq. (4.32) to the vacuum state, one
can see that the vacuum states in the position and momentum representations coincide.
By applying a creation operator eay
s(k;t) to the vacuum state an arbitrary number
of times we may generate the full symmetric Fock space of states containing any number68
of photons. A state containing nidentical photons is denoted
jns(k;t)i=1p
n!eay
s(k;t)nj0i: (4.34)
Whenn= 1 we shall refer to these states as single-photon states.
4.3.2 The photon commutation relations
Commutation relations
In this section we look at the commutation relations for the photon creation and anni-
hilation operators eay
s(k;t) andeas(k;t) dened in the previous section. As photons are
bosons, many-photon states are unchanged when two or more photons are exchanged.
This leads us to the typical commutation relation for bosonic particles:
h
eas(k;t);eas00(k0;t0)i
=h
eay
s(k;t);eay
s00(k0;t0)i
= 0
(4.35)
for anys,s0,,0,k,k0,tandt0. These relations are consistent with Eq. (4.13). In
order to determine the commutation relation between photon creation and annihilation
operators we use the Fourier transformations of the photon operators given in Eq. (4.31).
Using the blip commutation relation given in Eq. (4.17) we nd that

eas(k;t);eay
s00(k0;t)
=(k k0)s;s0;0: (4.36)
Using this commutator one may also show that single-photon states are orthogonal to
one another as
h1s(k;t)j1s00(k0;t)i=h0j
eas(k;t);eay
s00(k0;t)
j0i
=(k k0)s;s0;0: (4.37)69
As one would expect, the photons that we consider in this section are bosonic particles.
The fundamental equation of motion
By using the Fourier expressions of the blip operators we may also determine a funda-
mental equation of motion for the photon operators. By substituting the right-hand side
of Eq. (4.32) into Eq. (4.12) one nds that the photon operators satisfy the equation
d
dteas(k;t) = ikceas(k;t): (4.38)
The solution of this equation is
eas(k;t) =e ikcteas(k;0): (4.39)
This equation is the usual equation of motion of the quantised EM eld in momentum
space and shows that photons oscillate with an angular frequency !=kc. Sinceknow
takes all values along the real line, !can now take all real values. As we have seen
already and shall see again, however, this is not a problem because the energy observable
is always positive. This is possible because the energy observable and the generator of
the system's dynamics are no longer the same.
4.3.3 Field observables in the momentum representation
The eld observables
In this section we consider how to express the complex electric and magnetic eld ob-
servables in their momentum representations. As in Section 2.1, we denote these elds
eE(k;t) andeB(k;t). These elds are three-vector valued and parametrised by a time t
and a wave number k. As we have seen in Section 4.2.3, the electric and magnetic eld
vectors are a linear superposition of travelling wave solutions with a xed direction of
propagation and polarisation. As the Fourier transform is linear, the same applies in the70
momentum representation. Thus
eO(k;t) =X
s=1X
=H;VeOs(k;t) (4.40)
whereeO=eE;eB. As in Eqs. (4.31) and (4.32), we include a factor of sin the denition
of the wave vector. Hence
Os(x;t) =Z1
 1dkp
2eiskxeOs(k;t)
eOs(k;t) =Z1
 1dxp
2e iskxOs(x;t): (4.41)
Like the photon operators themselves, the eld observables in the momentum represent-
ation satisfy the equation
d
dteOs(k;t) = ikceOs(k;t): (4.42)
In analogy to standard quantisations of the EM eld, in which the system can be
described as a collection of simple harmonic oscillators (see Section 2.1.6 and Ref. [123]),
and in agreement with the transformations given in Eqs. (4.31) and (4.32), we assume
that the complex electric and magnetic eld observables can be expressed as a linear
combination of the photon annihilation operators:
eE(k;t) =X
s=1c
(k)ei'(k)[easH(k;t)by+easV(k;t)bz];
eB(k;t) =X
s=1s
(k)ei'(k)[easH(k;t)bz easV(k;t)by]: (4.43)
Here 
(k) is ak-dependent numerical factor. By introducing the k-dependent phase
'(k) we may assume that 
( k) is real. By substituting Eq. (4.39) into Eq. (4.43) one
can show that Eq. (4.42) is satised.71
The eld amplitudes
The equation of motion (4.42), however, does not determine the particular value of

(k)ei'(k). The factor 
( k) is a function that determines the amplitude of the eld
observables and, therefore, the energy of a single photon in the ( k;s; ) mode. Due to
the isotropy of free space, we can safely assume that 
( k) does not have any dependence
on eithersor. Furthermore, to ensure the symmetry of the eld excitations, 
( k) must
be an even function. For the time being we shall not specify 
( k) any further, but shall
return to this function in Section 4.4.1.
4.3.4 Energy in the momentum representation
The energy observable
For completeness we now also derive the energy observable of the quantised EM eld
Henergy (t) in the momentum representation. Taking as our starting point the expression
for the classical eld energy in Eq. (2.21), and substituting in for the classical elds the
position-dependent eld observables in their Fourier representations, one nds that
Henergy (t) ="0Ac2
4X
s=1X
=H;VZ1
 1dk

(k)ei'(k)eas(k;t) + 
( k)e i'( k)eay
s( k;t)2: (4.44)
The expectation value of the energy observable above is again positive which is guaranteed
by the squared expression in the integrand.
In Eq. (4.44), the energy observable has an explicit dependence on the choice of phase
'(k). When we restrict this theory to positive wave numbers only, this dependence
disappears, but we cannot make that assumption here. The absolute phase of a eld is
not observable, and therefore should not have an explicit dependence in the energy of
the eld. Therefore, we must impose the following condition:
'(k) = '( k): (4.45)72
One can see that the phase gained by evolving the system in time is of this form. By
substituting Eq. (4.39) into Eq. (4.44) one may verify that the energy observable is time-
independent.
Interference eects
Unlike the usual Hamiltonian for a system of uncoupled harmonic oscillators, the above
energy observable contains additional terms consisting of pairs of annihilation or creation
operators only. These terms have a natural explanation as they are necessary in order to
accommodate interference eects that may arise in this new model. In particular, the real
eld expectation values associated with photon states occupying the positive-frequency
or negative-frequency part of the Fourier spectrum of a blip can interfere with, and even
cancel, each other when characterised by the same values of sand.
To see this consider the operator
D=Dk()D k( ): (4.46)
HereDk() is the displacement operator dened in Eq. (3.23) for states with a single
polarisation and direction of propagation. The subscript kis to remind us that this is
a coherent superposition of states with a single frequency krather than of normalised
wave packets. By again using Eq. (3.23) and the expression for the eld observables in
Eq. (4.43), one may show that the operator Ddened in Eq. (4.46) commutes with both
the electric and magnetic eld observables. It follows therefore that
hk; 
 kjO(x;t)jk; 
 ki=h0jDyO(x;t)Dj0i
=h0jDyDO(x;t)j0ii
=h0jO(x;t)j0i
= 0 (4.47)
where O=E;B. The fourth line follows from the third by the unitarity of displacement73
operators. In the above we see that, whereas a single coherent state jki, for example,
has a non-zero eld expectation value, by introducing to the system the additional state
j 
 ki, the eld expectation values will vanish everywhere.
When we consider wave packets containing an integer number of photons character-
ised by a single polarisation and value of s, the positive-frequency and negative-frequency
components of the wave packet cannot interfere with each other either totally construct-
ively or totally destructively because their wave fronts propagate in opposite directions.
On the other hand, when, as in Eq. (4.47), we calculate the expectation value of the
classical eld observables with respect to a coherent state, a state containing contribu-
tions from the positive part of the Fourier spectrum of a blip will contribute to both the
positive-frequency part of the eld expectation value and its negative-frequency complex
conjugate. Similarly, a state containing photons belonging to the negative-frequency part
of a blip will contribute to both the negative-frequency part of the expectation value and
its positive-frequency complex conjugate.
As a result of this, by introducing negative-frequency excitations we are able to
construct distinct states that have opposing eld expectation values and therefore inter-
fere destructively. Similarly the state jk;
 kihas an energy four times that of either
coherent state independently, which is due to constructive interference. Without the
additional terms, this would not be correctly represented in the energy expectation value
of the state. This means, however, that in the classical limit of this theory there is
a redundancy between the positive- and negative-frequency photons characterised by
! > 0 and! < 0 respectively. In both cases it is possible to construct identical eld
expectation values that evolve identically, but both are needed to construct localised
single-photon wave packets that propagate without dispersion. In future, in order to
avoid any problems that may arise due to this redundancy, it may be required that the
classical observables are projected onto a subspace of the total Hilbert space containing
the usual positive-frequency excitations only.74
4.3.5 The dynamical Hamiltonian
Eq. (4.38) shows that the n-photon states jns(k;t)iare, up to the accumulation of a time-
dependent phase factor, invariant under the dynamical evolution of the EM eld. They
are therefore eigenstates of the dynamical Hamiltonian. Using the photon commutation
relations in Eq. (4.36) it can be shown that
Hdyn(t) =X
s=1X
=H;VZ1
 1dk~ckeay
s(k;t)eas(k;t): (4.48)
Using the transformations given in Eqs. (4.31) and (4.32), the above Hamiltonian can be
shown to be identical to that given in Eq. (4.29).
In Section 4.2.4 we pointed out that the dynamical Hamiltonian for blip states had
both positive and negative eigenvalues. This ensured that the dynamics of localised light
pulses was reversible: light moving to the left is indistinguishable from light moving to the
right when time is reversed. Here we have found that, if our system contains photons of
negativek, then the dynamical Hamiltonian in this representation also possesses positive
and negative eigenvalues. In the momentum representation, the dynamical Hamiltonian
takes a much simpler form than the equivalent expression in the position representation
(cf. Eqs. (4.29) and (4.48)).
4.4 The importance of the position and momentum repres-
entations, and the role of the regularisation operator
In this section let us emphasize that both the position and momentum space quantisation
approaches are important in obtaining a complete picture of the quantised EM eld. For
example, studying the EM eld in position space has helped us to identify an otherwise
hidden degree of freedom: the parameter swhich characterises the direction of propaga-
tion of wave packets of light. In Section 4.2 we determined the Hilbert space for modelling
localised wave packets in one dimension. By solving Maxwell's equations we were also75
able to determine a set of eld observables in addition to deriving a dynamical Hamilto-
nian that describes the evolution of the system. However, we were not able to determine
the particular value of the regularisation operator Rwhich establishes a relationship
between the local blip operators and the electric and magnetic eld observables.
Although both the position and momentum representations are essentially equivalent,
it is easier to determine these regularisation factors in momentum space. In the following
we shall determine this factor. The Fourier transforms in Eqs. (4.31) and (4.32) allow
us to alternate freely between the position and momentum representations. Once we
have identied 
( k) we will then be able to determine the eect of the regularisation
Ron the blip operators. Later in this section we shall look at the relationship between
this and the standard description of the quantised EM eld in momentum space. It is
shown that the standard description emerges when we restrict the photon annihilation
operators that we consider to a certain subset of operators.
4.4.1 Lorentz covariance
In Section 4.3.3, we were only able to dene the electric and magnetic eld observables
up to ak-dependent factor 
( k) which was shown to be directly related to the energy of
a photon. One way of determining this factor is to take into account that spontaneous
emission from an individual atom or ion results in exactly one photon. This assumption is
in good agreement with quantum optics experiments which generate single energy quanta
on demand [156, 157, 158, 159]. These behave as monochromatic waves with energies and
frequencies determined by the atomic transition frequency !0. A dierent but equivalent
method is to ensure that the electric and magnetic eld observables transform correctly
under the orthochronous Lorentz transformations. In this section we shall follow this
latter approach.
For light propagating along the xaxis, the possible transformations are translations
inxandt, and rotations about and boosts along the xaxis. A rotation changes the
polarisation of the EandBelds, which are oriented in the y-zplane, but leaves the76
direction of propagation unchanged. The inner product between two states is a Lorentz
scalar, and is therefore unchanged by a Lorentz transformation. We shall denote a single
such transformation by the Greek letter . Naturally, these changes of reference frame
induce a unitary operation U(). Under a translation or a rotation, the photon creation
operator gains only a phase factor. The Lorentz boosts along the xaxis, however, involve
a more interesting transformation. Let us choose the particular transformation  that
causes a Doppler shift of the wave number kto the new wave number pwithout changing
the polarisation or direction of the photon. By taking into account Eq. (4.36) and using
the Lorentz invariant measure d k=jkjone may show that the single-photon inner product
given in Eq. (4.37) is both Lorentz- and form-invariant only when
U()eas(k)Uy() =rp
keas(p): (4.49)
When a change of reference frame is made, either by moving the eld or moving
ourselves, the new eld is some transformed value of the original eld strength measured
at the untransformed position. In classical electromagnetism, the electric and magnetic
eld vectors transform as the components of an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor. We should
expect the expectation values of the quantised eld observables to transform in just the
same way. By unitarily transforming the position-dependent eld observables in their
momentum representations, one nds that the correct transformation occurs when

(k) =p
jkj
0: (4.50)
This result is calculated in three dimensions in Appendix (A), but the one-dimensional
result is analogous. Furthermore, if we want the expectation values of the energy observ-
ableHenergy (t) in Eq. (4.44) and of the dynamical Hamiltonian Hdyn(t) in Eq. (4.48) to
be the same, at least in some cases, we must also choose
j
0j2=2~
"0Ac: (4.51)77
The latter equivalence only holds for states with positive values of k. In general, the
above choice of 
 0implies that the energy expectation value of a single photon in the
(s;k; ) mode equals ~cjkj.
4.4.2 The regularisation operator revisited
In Section 4.3.1 we demonstrated how to transform between the blip and photon operators
by means of a Fourier transform. By combining Eqs. (4.31) and (4.32) with Eq. (4.18)
one will arrive at the expressions
E(x;t) =X
s=1Z1
 1dkp
2cei(skx+'(k))(R[easH] (k;t)by+R[easV] (k;t)bz);

 1dkp
2sei(skx+'(k))(R[easH] (k;t)bz R[easV] (k;t)by):(4.52)
Moreover, by substituting Eq. (4.50) into the Fourier transforms (see. Eq. (4.41)) of the
electric and magnetic eld observables given in Eq. (4.43), one nds that
E(x;t) =X
s=1Z1

2ss
2~jkj
"0Acei(skx+'(k))(easH(k;t)bz easV(k;t)by):(4.53)
This equivalence between the complex eld observables above allows us to determine the
action of the superoperator Ron a photon annihilation operator. We nd that
R[eas] (k;t) =s
2~jkj
"0Aceas(k;t): (4.54)
In the momentum representation, in order to regularise the photon operators we multiply
them by (2 ~jkj="0Ac)1=2. As expected from the symmetries of the quantised EM eld,
the superoperator Rdepends on neither x,t,snor.
In Eq. (4.52) we assumed that the regularised blip operators, which before regular-
isation are the Fourier transforms of the photon operators, are the Fourier transforms78
of the regularised photon operators. The action of the regularisation superoperator R
on a blip annihilation operator can therefore be determined by calculating the Fourier
transform of Eq. (4.54). One will nd that the action of the regularisation operator on a
blip annihilation operator is of the type given in Eq. (4.19) where the R(x x0) is given
by
R(x x0) =Z1
 1dk
2eik(x x0)s
2~jkj
"0Ac: (4.55)
The above trick of introducing the superoperator Rallows us to describe the quantised
EM eld in position space in terms of local bosonic blip operators without having to
sacrice the Lorentz covariance of the electric and magnetic eld observables E(x;t) an
B(x;t). Importantly, however, this distribution is not local in the same way that the
Dirac delta function is. We can see this by evaluating R(x x0) at values x6=x0:
R(x x0) = r
~
4"0Ac1
jx x0j3=2: (4.56)
This means that the eld observables are not a simple linear superposition of blip op-
erators dened at the same point (see Fig. 4.2 (c)). However, since it is easier to work
with bosonic annihilation and creation operators, we can perform all calculations in the
Hilbert space created by the local bosonic operators. As a nal point we may mention
that, due to the equivalence of the eld observables, the two representations of the energy
observable are equal.
4.4.3 Comments on eld and blip localisation
As was mentioned in the Introduction, some authors will prefer to work with non-locally
acting operators that have a closer link to the eld observables [35, 53, 54, 55]. Such
operators are given by
As(x;t) =R[as](x;t) (4.57)79
and describe excitations that share a vacuum with the blip operators. The reason we
dierentiate between blip operators as(x;t) and the eld excitations As(x;t) is that the
blip operators possess a set of bosonic commutation relations (Eq. (4.17)) with respect
to the conventional inner product. In contrast to this, the commutation relation for the
As(x;t) operators is

 1dk
22~jkj

Nevertheless, one can see from Eq. (4.18), for example, that the energy quanta asso-
ciated with the As(x;t) operators can be more easily associated with the electric and
magnetic eld observables.
With respect to the usual inner product, the single-excitation states j1A
s(x;t)i=

s(x;t)j0iare not orthogonal to one another. Using Eq. (4.58), one can show that

s00(x0;t)i=h0j
As(x;t);Ay
s00(x0;t)
j0i6= 0: (4.59)
This is related to the well-known problem that the measurable eld observables have the
units of (energy density)1=2and not (probability density)1=2as would be expected for a
wave function compatible with the Born rule.
Although we shall not make use of it here, for completeness it is worth describing a
method by which we may impose bosonic commutation relations on the As(x;t) oper-
ators. This is achieved by introducing a new inner product { labelled by superscript A{
such that:
h1A
s(x;t)j1A
s00(x0;t)iA=h1s(x;t)j1s00(x0;t)i
=(x x0): (4.60)
Under this new inner product the single-photon eld excitations form an orthogonal80
Figure 4.2: [55] This gure compares the locality of dierent excitations under the stand-
ard inner product and the inner product denoted A. (a) A monochromatic photon is
equally likely to be found anywhere along the xaxis using either inner product. (b) Un-
der the standard inner product a localised blip, illustrated by the white particle, carries
with it a non-local eld whose relation to the position of the blip is given by Eq. (4.56).
(c) Under the standard inner product, a localised eld excitation, which is generated by
the operators Ay
s(x;t) operator, is constructed from a non-local superposition of blips.
Under the biorthogonal inner product, the blips and elds can be localised simultan-
eously.
basis of states in the position representation. This is shown in Fig. 4.2 (d). However,
this new inner product drastically alters the Hilbert space of the quantised EM eld.
One consequence of this change, for instance, is that some previously Hermitian op-
erators become non-Hermitian, whereas other previously non-Hermitian operators may
become Hermitian [60, 61, 62]. For this reason, this aspect of quantum physics is known
as \biorthogonal" or \pseudo-Hermitian" quantum mechanics. It is an interesting area of
physics that has attracted a lot of attention in the eld of local quantum electrodynam-
ics (QED) [35, 45, 53, 54, 151, 160]. Although this is a very elegant way of restoring
orthogonality, as we have investigated in Ref. [55], introducing a biorthogonal system81
introduces complexities that are by no means necessary to our understanding of the local
dynamics of photons.
4.4.4 The relation to standard descriptions
In this nal subsection, we compare the description of the EM eld in Section 4.3 with
the standard description of the quantised EM eld in momentum space, and ask which
additional assumptions have to be made for the latter to emerge. Looking at Eqs. (4.44)
and (4.48), and using the value of 
( k) given by Eqs. (4.50) and (4.51), we can see that
the energy observable and dynamical Hamiltonian coincide when the negative-frequency
modes are excluded and we restrict ourself to positive values of konly. As one can check,
in this case the eld observables in Eqs. (4.52) and (4.53) become the same as the local
eld observables in the standard description of the quantised EM eld [131]. As we know,
the positive-frequency photon states provide a complete description of the quantised EM
eld in the sense that they can be superposed to reproduce the right electric and magnetic
eld expectation values of wave packets of any shape. However, as we have seen in the
introduction to this chapter, they are not sucient to generate the quantum versions
of all possible solutions of Maxwell's equations, like highly-localised wave packets that
remain localised [72, 73].
4.5 Discussion
In standard quantisations of the free EM eld in one dimension, the basic excitations of
the eld are characterised by a wave number k, a frequency !=jkjcand a polarisation .
These degrees of freedom, however, are not sucient for constructing single-photon wave
packets that are both localised and propagate at the speed of light without dispersion.
In this chapter we have constructed a complete description of the quantised EM eld
in one dimension by assuming that the basic quanta of the eld are blips, which have a
well-dened position, polarisation and direction of propagation. Using these conditions,
we then identied the Schr odinger equation for this system and constructed electric82
and magnetic eld observables E(x;t) and B(x;t) that are consistent with Maxwell's
equations. The Lorentz covariance of these eld operators is achieved with the help of a
regularisation superoperator R. Although the blips themselves are local, they generate
non-local elds which can be felt in a region of the space surrounding them (see Fig. 4.2
(b)).
By writing the blip excitations as superpositions of monochromatic photons, we have
also shown that our approach is consistent with the standard theory of the quantised
EM eld with the addition of countable negative-frequency states. Previously, these
states have been widely overlooked but the concept of adopting them to negate the
consequences of Hegerfeldt's theorem [72] is not new. For example, Allcock pointed
out that negative-frequency modes are necessary for dening states that have a well-
dened and measurable time of arrival [161, 162, 163]. It is also possible to dene a
time of arrival for blip states. Negative-frequency solutions have also been considered
in Refs. [31, 52, 101, 106, 164, 165, 166, 167]. In Refs. [53, 146, 168, 169] negative
frequencies were also considered in the context of constructing real eld excitations. In
this chapter, by introducing local particles of light with a given direction of propagation
we have claried how these solutions arise naturally in a covariant quantised theory. In
addition, we have exposed some consequences of a theory containing these states such
as the dierence between the energy observable Henergy (t) and the generator for time
translations, that is, the dynamical Hamiltonian.
In classical electrodynamics, a local description of the EM eld is often preferable to a
non-local description. Similarly, we expect that the modelling of the quantised EM eld
in terms of blip states will sometimes be preferable to the standard description in terms
of monochromatic photon states. For example, this theory should provide an extremely
useful tool for the modelling of the quantised EM eld in inhomogeneous dielectric media
and on curved space-times [111]. Other potential applications include modelling linear
optics experiments with ultra-broadband photons [147, 148, 149, 150] or local light-matter
interactions. For example, in Ref. [110], we used the blip annihilation operators as(x;t)83
to construct locally-acting mirror Hamiltonians. This work might also inspire other areas
of quantum physics where there is a need for a local description of quantum elds, for
instance, the modelling of electrons in quantum transport problems. Later in this thesis
we shall show how the results of this paper also provide novel insight into the Fermi
problem and the Casimir eect.Chapter 5
Local photons in three dimensions
This chapter provides a complete quantisation of the free EM eld in three dimensions
in terms of particles that are, like in one dimension, perfectly localised and propagate
at the speed of light. In Section 5.2 we initially take a na ve approach to quantisation
by describing light as rays, but later nd that these excitations form an over-complete
basis of the Hilbert space. A complete basis is constructed in terms of plane wave
excitations. In Section 5.3 we show that a reduced and complete Hilbert space can still
be constructed in terms of perfectly localised excitations, and in Section 5.4 we use these
excitations to provide a new quantisation of the free EM eld in three dimensions that
is analogous to the results of the previous chapter. Here, as before, we construct a set of
eld observables and determine a dynamical Hamiltonian for the system which dieres
from the usual energy observable.
5.1 Introduction: Lessons from one dimension
In the previous chapter we quantised the free EM eld in one dimension in terms of
localised energy quanta, so-called blips, that have a well-dened direction of propagation
and move without dispersion. The purpose of this chapter is to extend the work of the
previous chapter and determine a more complete quantisation of the free EM eld that
describes all possible solutions of Maxwell's equations in three dimensions. A three-
8485
dimensional description of the EM eld will have the benet of providing a general
formalism for describing light in a much more expansive array of problems, for example,
predicting experimental verications of the Casimir eect. This theory will hopefully
provide a greater set of tools that will enable new investigations into many dierent
topics.
In Section 2.1.4, we showed that the one-dimensional wave equation, satised by
both E(x;t) and B(x;t), can be factorised into two rst-order equations which solve
for elds propagating either to the left or the right at the speed of light. This enabled
us to immediately construct a rst-order dierential equation of motion for the basic
excitations of the EM eld. In three dimensions this is not possible as solutions of the
wave equation (2.16) cannot all be said to propagate in a given direction, such as left or
right, but may propagate in all sorts of directions. This makes it dicult to identify the
basic solutions of Maxwell's equations in the position representation. In the past, some
authors have used a massless Dirac-like equation as the fundamental equation of motion
for photons in the position representation. In this chapter, however, we shall instead
follow the one-dimensional approach as closely as possible by identifying the solutions of
Maxwell's equations that have a xed direction of propagation.
In Section 2.1.4, we considered waves that propagate along the xaxis only. As the
three-dimensional wave equation is rotationally invariant, any rotation of these solutions
will provide a further set of solutions to Maxwell's equations. Taking this into account
and letting sbe a constant unit vector, any one-dimensional solution of the wave equation
propagating in the sdirection will satisfy the equation

sr+1
c@
@t
Os(r;t) = 0 (5.1)
where Os=Es;Bsare the solutions of the wave equation that propagate in the sdirection
only. Here sis assumed to be constant with respect to all coordinates.
Using the equation of motion (5.1), it is also possible to show that the three-dimensional
electric and magnetic eld vectors Es(r;t) and Bs(r;t) are orthogonal to both sand each86
other. To show that this is the case, one must rst note that, for a divergence-less vector
eldOs, the following relation holds:
r(sO) =srOs: (5.2)
Using the above relation in conjunction with Faraday's and the Maxwell-Amp ere law
given by Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11), one may show that Eq. (5.1) is satised when
Es=c(sBs) (5.3)
and
Bs= 1
c(sEs): (5.4)
Thus Es,Bsandsform an orthogonal triad. Moreover, since EsandBscan be rotated
about swithout changing their relative orientations, the electric and magnetic elds
propagating in the direction of smay be further characterised by two linear polarisations
orthogonal to s. Note also that sis parallel to the Poynting vector dened in Eq. (2.20).
The considerations above provide a good starting point for quantising the free, three-
dimensional EM eld in position space. We have seen, for instance, that there are
solutions of Maxwell's equations that propagate in a xed direction s, have two distinct
polarisations, and satisfy a rst-order equation of motion. In the remainder of this
chapter, we shall build upon these observations to develop a description of the three-
dimensional quantised EM eld in the position and momentum representations.
5.2 A na ve approach to quantisation in the position rep-
resentation
In this section we describe the free EM eld in terms of localised excitations that can
each travel in any single direction, and we dene some of their basic properties. We also
dene an appropriate set of eld observables. Towards the end of this section we shall87
demonstrate that these excitations provide an over-complete basis of the Hilbert space
and that plane wave excitations present a more suitable set of principal excitations.
5.2.1 The Hilbert space
Blip states
As in the one-dimensional theory, we assume here that the fundamental building blocks
of the electric and magnetic eld observables are a set of spatially localised particles. We
shall again refer to these excitation as blips. In three dimensions, blips are localised to a
single point characterised by the three-dimensional position vector r2R3. As discussed
in the preceding introduction, blips have a unique direction of propagation which is no
longer xed along a specic axis but may be oriented in any constant direction of our
choosing. The direction of propagation is characterised by the three-dimensional unit
vector s2S2which is oriented in the direction of propagation. Here S2is the unit
two-sphere which consists of all possible unit vectors. Blip states are also characterised
by a polarisation 2fH;Vgthat species the orientation of the associated electric and
magnetic eld observables.
In this description, the basic elements of the Hilbert space are localised energy quanta
that move with a xed direction tracing out rays as illustrated in Fig. 5.1. The reader
may like to argue that light does not form perfectly narrow rays in reality. This, how-
ever, would only be a consequence of having an over-complete Hilbert space rather than
an under-complete one. For now we shall proceed by assuming that the basic excita-
tions of the eld propagate along these rays and later determine any constraints on the
arrangement of these rays that would eectively reduce the size of our Hilbert space.
Annihilation and creation operators
As in previous sections we dene a set of creation and annihilation operators that add
and remove blips from the system. We denote the blip annihilation operators as(r;t) in
the Heisenberg picture and as(r;0) in the Schr odinger picture. The vacuum state j0iof88

Figure 5.1: The gure shows a single blip propagating in the direction of s. The blip
remains localised as it propagates along the trajectory characterised by sand indicated
by the dotted line. The parameters randsdetermine this trajectory uniquely. An
identical blip characterised by a vector  swould propagate along the same path in the
opposite direction. The coordinates ( q1;q2;q3) form a right-handed coordinate system
where theq1axis is aligned with s.
the system, which contains exactly zero blip excitations, is dened such that
as(r;t)j0i= 0 (5.5)
for all r;t;sand. The vacuum state is normalised to unity: h0j0i= 1.
As before, a single-blip state is generated by applying the creation operator ay
s(r;t)
to the vacuum state:
j1s(r;t)i=ay
s(r;t)j0i: (5.6)
The single-blip Hilbert space is therefore spanned by such states for all r,sandat
a xed time. By applying a creation operator to the vacuum state repeatedly we can
generate states that contain any number of blips. In analogy to Eqs. (3.12) and (4.10),
a state that contains nidentical blips at a time tis denoted
jns(r;t)i=1p
n!ay
s(r;t)nj0i: (5.7)89
The total Hilbert space is the symmetric Fock space of the single-blip Hilbert space.
A fundamental equation of motion
In the introduction to this chapter we pointed out that components of the electric and
magnetic eld vectors that propagate in a space-xed direction swill satisfy the rst-
order equation of motion (5.1). The solutions to Eq. (5.1) describe waves that propagate
in the direction of sat the speed of light. As blips represent the basic excitations of the
eld, we propose here that blips characterised by a vector swill also propagate in this
direction at the speed of light. This condition places a constraint on the expectation
values of the blip operators, and therefore the operators themselves, which leads us to
the following equation of motion:

sr+1
c@
@t
as(r;t) = 0: (5.8)
Although a blip state is characterised by three spatial coordinates that specify its
position in space, as blips only move in a single direction (indicated by s), the dynamics
of a blip will only depend on a single coordinate. The remaining two coordinates dene
the position of this one-dimensional trajectory. To help us describe the solutions to
Eq. (5.8), let us introduce a new Cartesian coordinate system r= (q1;q2;q3) where the
q1axis is oriented in the direction of sas illustrated in Fig. 5.1. Although this coordinate
system depends on the orientation of s, there is still a well-dened way of constructing
this coordinate system for each choice of s. We shall assume that all three coordinate
axes are orthogonal. The solutions to Eq. (5.8) are then given by
as(q1;q2;q3;t) =as(q1 ct;q 2;q3; 0): (5.9)
This equation of motion is analogous to Eq. (4.11).90
5.2.2 Blip commutation relations
Commutation relations
As blips are bosons, a state containing many particles is unchanged by the exchange of
any two blips within that state. Consequently, all blip creation and annihilation operators
commute with one another:
h
ay
s(r;t);ay
s00(r0;t0)i
=h
as(r;t);as00(r0;t0)i
= 0: (5.10)
for all r,r0,t,t0,s,s0,and0. As in Eq. (3.15), the commutation relation between
the blip creation and annihilation operators is determined by the inner product between
two single-blip states:
h1s(r;t)j1s00(r0;t0)i=h
as(r;t);ay
s00(r0;t0)i
: (5.11)
This inner product must now be determined.
Orthogonal states
As blips are entirely localised at a point specied by the vector r, blips dened at dierent
positions must all be orthogonal to one another at a given xed time. Moreover, as
polarisation is a measurable quantity and blips characterised by dierent values of shave
dierent dynamics, they must all be distinguishable and therefore belong to dierent
Hilbert spaces. Hence, in the following we nd that
h1s(r;t)j1s00(r0;t0)i=h0jh
as(r;t);ay
s00(r0;t0)i
j0i
=3(r r0)2(s s0);0: (5.12)91
Single-blip wave packets
As we have seen above, the single-blip states characterised by a single value of the con-
tinuous variables sandrare therefore non-normalisable. Physical states of the system,
on the other hand, are given by nitely normalised wave packets as were described in
Section 3.2.2. Hence, a single-photon wave packet is given by the superposition
j (t)i=ay(t)j0i=X
=H;VZ
S2d2sZ1
 1d3r s(r)j1s(r;t)i (5.13)
whereay(t) is the single-photon creation operator for the wave packet with position wave
function s(r).
To ensure that this state is normalised and that
a(t);ay(t)
= 1, the wave function
 s(r) must satisfy the condition
X
=H;VZ
S2d2sZ1
 1d3rj s(r)j2= 1: (5.14)
Eq. (5.13) above will help us determine the complete physical Hilbert space of states
later in this chapter.
5.2.3 Field observables in the position representation
Field observables
In this section we shall determine a set of expressions for the complex three-dimensional
eld observables E(r;t) and B(r;t) in terms of the blip operators as(r;t) anday
s(r;t).
Analogous to the results found in Sections 3.2 and 4.2.3, we shall assume that the complex
eld observables are given by a linear superposition of blip annihilation operators. Since
both the components of the electric and magnetic eld observables and the blip operators92
obey Eq. (2.16), we assume that
E(r;t) =Z
S2d2scfRsH[asH](r;t) +RsV[asV](r;t)g
B(r;t) =Z
S2d2sfRsH[asH](r;t) +RsV[asV](r;t)gs: (5.15)
The above operator Rsdenotes a translation-invariant superoperator that shall again
be referred to as the regularisation operator. These eld observables have been chosen
such that the relations given in Eq. (5.3) are satised.
The regularisation operator
As in Section 4.2.3, we have introduced a position-independent regularisation operator
in order to relate the electric and magnetic eld observables to the local blip operators.
This regularisation operator will again allow us to ensure that the eld observables have
the correct dimensionality and transformation properties without having to sacrice the
orthogonality of the blip operators. Unlike the regularisation operator dened in Section
4.2.3, the regularisation operator is now vector valued. In one dimension, light is always
polarised in the y-zplane, and the constant polarisation vectors can therefore be forgot-
ten. In three dimensions, however, the polarisation vectors, like s, can be oriented in any
direction, so must be included in the denition of Rs.
The regularisation operator can again be understood in a distributional sense in the
following way

In order to satisfy Eq. (5.3), the distributions Rs(r r0) must be oriented in a direction
orthogonal to s. Furthermore, a change in the polarisation will rotate Rs(r r0) about
the direction of propagation. The orientation of Rs(r r0) therefore depends on both93
sand.
5.2.4 Physical particle states
Field expectation values
In Section 5.2.3 we constructed a set of eld observables that satisfy both the equation
of motion 5.1 for light propagating in one direction and the eld relations specied in
Eq. (5.3). We must now ensure that the expectation values of these eld observables
always satisfy Maxwell's equations (2.8)-(2.11). The main outcome of this section will be
to determine which wave functions  s(r) correspond to physical solutions of Maxwell's
equations. This will enable us later on to reduce a possibly over-complete Hilbert space to
a complete set of states describing all possible physical solutions of Maxwell's equations.
Since eld expectation values calculated with respect to a state containing an integer
number of blips are always zero, we shall rst construct a coherent state j(t)ifrom the
normalised wave packets dened in Eq. (5.13) in the manner described in Section 3.2.2.
With the help of Eqs. (3.20), (3.21), (5.12) and (5.13), one may then show that
as(r;t)j(t)i= s(r)j(t)i: (5.17)
Hence, the statej(t)iis an eigenstate of the blip annihilation operator. It follows from
the equation above that the expectation values of the (complex) electric and magnetic
eld observables, E(r;t) and B(r;t), calculated with respect to j(t)iare given by
hE(r;t)i=X

S2d2scRs[ s] (r)
hB(r;t)i=X
=H;VZ
S2d2sRs[ s] (r)s: (5.18)
In the above expectation values the notation Rs[ s] (r) is shorthand for the quantity
Rs[ s] (r) =Z
R3d3r0Rs(r r0) s(r0): (5.19)94
Characteristics of physical wave packets
The eld observables (5.15) have been oriented such that the relations given in Eq. (5.3)
are satised. Therefore, as all eld and blip operators satisfy Eq. (5.1) (see Eq. (5.8)),
all eld expectation values are guaranteed to satisfy Faraday's law and the Maxwell-
Amp ere law provided that the eld expectation values are divergence-less. Hence, in
order to ensure that the eld expectation values obey Maxwell's equations, we must
only determine for which wave functions Gauss's laws for electric and magnetic elds,
Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9), are satised.
With this in mind let us rst calculate the divergence of the eld expectation values
given in Eq. (5.18). Using the spatial independence of Rs, one may show that Gauss's
laws are satised only when the gradient of the wave function  s(r) is oriented in a
direction orthogonal to both RsandRss. This result is determined in App. (B).
SinceRsis orthogonal to s, the gradient of the wave function must lie either parallel or
anti-parallel to s. Referring to the coordinate system ( q1;q2;q3) dened in Section 5.2.1,
the wave functions that correspond to solutions of Maxwell's equations depend only on
the coordinate q1, but not on either q2orq3. This result implies that not all choices of
wave function represent physical solutions to Maxwell's equations and, therefore, that
our blip Hilbert space is over-complete. In the next section we shall determine a set of
annihilation and creation operators for the physical single-photon states that we have
found in this section.
5.2.5 A complete Hilbert space
Plane wave excitations
Let us look again at the single-photon wave packet dened in Eq. (5.13). We now only
consider the physical wave functions, which do not depend on either q2orq3. The95

single-photon wave function then takes the form

s(q1;t)j0i=1pL2L3Z
L2dq2Z
L3dq3ay
s(r;t)j0i: (5.21)
In the above we must normalise the state j1s(q1;t)iby the lengths L2andL3in the
q2andq3directions in order to ensure that Eq. (5.14) is still satised. L2andL3are
assumed to be very large. The single-blip states dened in Eq. (5.21) are a superposition
of blips characterised by a single q1for all values of q2andq3. Hence, such states represent
plane waves that propagate at the speed of light along the q1axis, normal to the plane
itself, in the direction of s. These states are illustrated in Fig. 5.2. Plane wave states
generated from the vacuum by the ay
s(q1;t) operators are characterised by a polarisation
, a direction of propagation sand a position along the q1axis.
We have seen above that all physical single-photon states in our description can be96
constructed by superposing the plane wave excitations given in Eq. (5.21). Although the
localised blip excitations can also be used to construct all physical single-photon wave
packets, they can be used to construct non-physical ones too. For this reason our original
Hilbert space was over-complete. A better way of quantising the free EM eld is to treat
the plane wave excitations generated by the as(q1;t) operators as the basic excitations
of the free EM eld. This is in close analogy to the results in Chapter 4, where the
basic excitations are plane waves propagating along the xaxis only. Furthermore, in
the classical theory, plane waves form a complete basis for the solutions of the vector
wave equation [170], which is satised by both the electric and magnetic elds. Later,
in Section 5.3, we shall see that there is an equivalent description of the reduced and
complete Hilbert space in terms of localised excitations rather than plane waves. Before
we get to this, in the remainder of this section we shall examine some important properties
of the plane wave excitations.
A fundamental equation of motion
As bothq2andq3are orthogonal to the direction of propagation, the blip equation
of motion given in Eq. (5.8), which contains a derivative in the q1direction only, acts
identically upon the plane wave excitations as it does upon the blip excitations. We nd,
therefore, that
csr+@
@t
as(q1;t) = 0: (5.22)
Analogous to the dynamical solutions of the one-dimensional excitations given in Eq. (4.11),
the solutions of this equation are
as(q1;t) =as(q1 ct;0) (5.23)
In the above we must remember that the q1axis is oriented in the direction of sand is
therefore reversed when the direction of propagation is reversed. Both left- and right-
propagating plane wave solutions are therefore present in Eq. (5.23).97
Commutation relations
As we have done for other excitations, the commutation relation for plane wave excit-
ations can be determined by calculating the inner product between two single-particle
states. Using Eqs. (5.12) and (5.21) one may show that the inner product between two
plane wave excitations is given by

s00(q0

annihilation operator respectively:

5.3 Localised states in three dimensions
In this section we show that there is an alternative and complete set of basis states for the
free EM eld that are localised, and can therefore replace plane waves as the principal
excitations of the eld. We also introduce a set of vector-valued excitations that have
the same dimensions as blips, but relate much more easily to the eld observables which
are distinct from the blips.
5.3.1 Blips in the position representation
Blip states
In the previous section we have shown that when light propagates in a xed and constant
direction, the basic excitations of the free EM eld are plane waves. Such excitations98
are not localised to a point, but, as the name suggests, localised to a plane and therefore
completely delocalised in two out of three dimensions. In the position representation of
the EM eld, we must be able to describe the elds at all points in space and time. In
order to make such a construction possible, however, it is necessary that the basic energy
quanta of the eld are point-like, and not stretched over a plane as the as(q1;t) energy
quanta are. The purpose of this section is to show that there is an alternative complete
basis of states in three dimensions that are completely localised in space.
Let us postulate the existence of localised energy quanta characterised by a position
rand timet, a polarisation and an additional discrete parameter s=1. Here we
reduce the Hilbert space that was considered earlier on in this chapter by making the
transition from s2S2tos2f  1;+1g. From the last section we saw that the plane
wave excitations can still propagate in two directions along the q1axis. In analogy to the
one-dimensional blips, the parameter sintroduced here is intended to play a similar role
and characterise the forwards and backwards motion of the plane. In other words, a state
characterised by a particular value sbehaves just like an identical state characterised by
 sif time is reversed. As these particles are localised we shall refer to them as blips,
and we will see later on that they provide a complete basis of the single-photon Hilbert
space. We denote the annihilation operators for these excitations as(r;t) and demand
that they share a vacuum state with the blip operators dened in Section 5.2.1. Finally,
we also assume that these excitations obey the wave equation (2.16):


Blip commutation relations
By applying the blip creation operators ay
s(r;t) repeatedly to the vacuum state we can
generate states containing any number of identical blips. We denote the n-blip states
jns(r;t)i=1p
n!ay
s(r;t)nj0i: (5.27)99
Whenn= 1 we refer to these states as single-blip states. Since blips are localised,
single-blip states dened at dierent positions at a xed time are orthogonal to one
another. We also assume here that states characterised by dierent values of sandare
distinguishable. This implies that such states are also orthogonal to one another. Hence,
the single-blip inner product is given by
h1s(r;t)j1s00(r0;t)i=3(r r0)s;s0;0: (5.28)
Taking into account that the bosonic creation and annihilation operators commute with
all other creation and annihilation operators respectively, the inner product dened above
in Eq. (5.28) implies the following commutation relations for the blip operators:

These expressions hold for all r,r0,s,s0,,0,tandt0.
5.3.2 Blips in the momentum representation
Photon states
An alternative but equivalent representation of these local excitations can be found by
expressing the blip operators in their Fourier representations as was done for the one-
dimensional blips in Section 4.3.1. By applying a Fourier transform to the blip operators
as(r;t) we obtain the operators eas(k;t). These are dened as
eas(k;t) =Z
R3d3r

We assume in the following, and will see later on, that the eas(k;t) operators represent
the annihilation operators of monochromatic photons. The inverse transformation is100

vacuum state coincides with the blip vacuum state.
Photon commutation relations
Since there is a strict invertible relationship between the blip and photon operators given
by Eqs. (5.30) and (5.31), we can determine the commutation relations for the latter by
direct calculation. Using the blip commutation relations given in Eq. (5.29), one nds
that

One may also show that the photon creation and annihilation operators commute with
all other creation and annihilation operators respectively:

for all k,k0,s,s0,,0,tandt0.
Using Eq. (5.31), we can now solve Eq. (5.26) which determines the time-dependence
of the photon operators. By substituting Eq. (5.31) into Eq. (5.26) and solving the
resulting equation one nds that

as the direction of propagation, there were only two ways in which the frequency !could
be continuously related to the wave vector k. These were !=kc. In three dimensions,
however, where single-photon wave packets can propagate in all sorts of directions, there
are many dierent possible choices of how to relate !tokands, and dierent choices
will be more suitable than others depending on the wave packet we are describing.
5.3.3 A complete basis of blip states
The relation between plane waves and blips
In this section we shall look at the relationship between the blip operators as(r;t)
introduced in Section 5.3.1 and the plane wave operators as(q1;t) introduced in Section
5.2.5. Both excitations are characterised by an identical number of parameters which
suggests that a relationship exists. First, let us consider the following wave packet:
j1s(q1;t)i=Z1
 1dk1p
2eisk1q1eay
s(k;t)j0i: (5.35)
In the above we shall choose the coordinate q1such that its axis lies either parallel or
anti-parallel to the vector kin such a way that kr=k1q1wherek1takes all real values.
By applying the above denitions and substituting into Eq. (5.35) the time-dependence
of the photon operator given in Eq. (5.34), the state given in Eq. (5.35) simplies to
j1s(q1;t)i=Z1
 1dk1p
2eisk1(q1 sct)eay
s(k;0)j0i: (5.36)
In the above expression we have made the particular choice !=k1cwhich satises
!2=jkj2c2; although, as mention earlier, other choices are possible. This wave packet
contains only a single blip in a superposition over the region spanned by the coordinates
q2andq3and has no dependence on either coordinate. This region has the structure
of a plane whose normal is parallel to the q1axis. We can think of this wave packet,
therefore, as a plane wave. By noting the exponent in Eq. (5.36), one can see that the
plane wave excitation above propagates along the q1axis in a direction determined by102
the parameter s. This is the exact same dynamics that were displayed by the plane wave
solutions in Section (5.2.5). Moreover, in fact, when s=sbq1wherebq1is a unit vector
oriented in the direction of increasing q1, the operator as(q1;t) associated with the state
in Eq. (5.36) satises Eq. (5.8). Here bq1lies on the unit half-sphere.
Plane wave commutation relations
We have determined that we can construct plane wave operators as(q1;t) with the
correct dynamics by superposing monochromatic photons over a single axis. With the
help of the photon commutation relations in Eq. (5.32), we can also determine a set
of commutation relations for the plane wave excitations constructed in Eq. (5.35). To
determine this commutation relation we rst look at the inner product between the two
plane wave excitations dened at equal times. Using Eq. (5.36) we nd that the equal-
time inner product between two plane wave packets with possibly dierent normals is
given by the expression
h1s(q1;t)j1s00(q0

To continue we note that the photon commutator (5.32), which appears in Eq. (5.37),
can be written in a slightly dierent form. As the vector ksatises k=k1bq1, the photon
commutator can be expressed as

In this nal line we have used the denition s=s^q1from the previous section. Here sis
the direction of propagation. As ^q1lies on the unit half-sphere, slies on the unit sphere.103
By substituting Eq. (5.38) into Eq. (5.37) one nds that

The commutator coincides exactly with that for the plane wave quanta in Section 5.2.5.

Blips as a complete basis
The localised blips dened in Section 5.3.1 can be used to construct single-photon plane
wave states that have a well-dened direction of propagation in addition to a polarisa-
tion about and position along the photon's trajectory. These states were constructed in
Eq. 5.35. What is more, the plane wave operators constructed in Section 5.3.3 are char-
acterised by an identical set of parameters, an identical set of commutation relations,
and governed by the same equation of motion as the plane wave operators dened in
Section 5.2.5. Both excitations also share a vacuum state. As the commutation relations
dene the Hilbert space of our system, we nd that the Hilbert spaces of the two systems
are identical, and governed by the same dynamical Hamiltonian. The main result of this
section, then, is that the system of localised blips dened in Section 5.3.1, or alternat-
ively the system of monochromatic photons dened in Section 5.3.2, provide a complete
description of the free quantised EM eld in three dimensions.
Unlike the plane wave energy quanta, blips are localised to a point. We are now in
a position to quantise the free EM eld in the position representation. This will be the
topic of Section 5.4 of this Chapter. In the standard theory of the quantised EM eld,104
photon states could be characterised at most by a position and a polarisation. In this
section we have introduced an additional parameter s=1, thus doubling the usual
Hilbert space. In one-dimension, this additional parameter could be interpreted as a
direction of propagation. In three dimensions, however, this is not necessarily the case.
Herescharacterises states that are the time-reversal of each other. As discussed in
Section 5.3.2, there are many dierent ways to introduce the parameter s; for instance, it
can be interpreted as the direction of propagation of a plane wave. What this parameter
implies, however, is that for every particle in the Hilbert space, the time-reversal of that
particle is also a member of the Hilbert space. Moreover, these excitations are orthogonal
to each other.
Finally, we would like to mention that it is perhaps not entirely surprising that the
plane wave excitations form a complete basis of states. In Chapter 4, the one-dimensional
blip states were localised to a point along the xaxis only. These excitations are essentially
also plane wave solutions as they are totally delocalised in the y-zplane. We can see
therefore that the results of this section are consistent with the results of Chapter 4, the
dierence being that in one dimension we only consider propagation along the xaxis; in
three dimensions we consider propagation in all directions.
5.3.4 Vector excitations
Vector operators
Blips form a complete basis of Hilbert space and are perfectly localised in space. We
need not go any further; we have what we are looking for, and can construct all possible
states from these blip excitations. For practical reasons, however, in this section we shall
introduce one more type of excitation: one that is vector valued.
The original reason for constructing blips was to describe the quantised solutions of
Maxwell's equations. The solutions of Maxwell's equations are vector elds; the states
generated by blips, on the other hand, are not. In general the orientation of the eld will
have an eect on the type of wave packets that can be constructed and their resulting105
Figure 5.3: For any continuous vector eld tangent to the surface of a sphere there must
be at least one point where the vector eld vanishes. This is known as the \Hairy-
ball" theorem. The red arrow in the gure indicates the point at which the vector eld
disappears. As the EM eld is oriented tangentially to its direction of propagation, it
is impossible to construct continuous and spherically symmetric solutions to Maxwell's
equations.
dynamics, particularly if the orientation of the elds is not position-independent. For
example, according to the so-called \Hairy Ball Theorem," perfectly isotropic electromag-
netic spherical waves do not exist (see Fig. 5.3). On the other hand, blip states localised
at a position rcan be superposed into a sphere without diculty. For this reason, it
becomes dicult to relate the vector-valued eld observables to the scalar-valued blip
operators that we have considered so far.
In general, we may wish to consider wave packets that have dierent structures and
propagate in position-dependent directions. To accommodate these possibilities, and
more closely relate the eld observables and particle excitations, in this section we shall
use the photon operators dened in Section 5.3.2 to construct vector-valued blip op-
erators. This particular choice of notation results in simpler expressions for the eld
observables later on in this chapter. The purpose of this section is to introduce tools
that will help us when applying this formalism to real applications in future.
Let us introduce a new vector-valued annihilation operator as(r;t). In terms of the106
photon operators eas(k;t), the vector operator as(r;t) is given by the formula
as(r;t) =X
=H;VZ
R3d3k
(2)3=2ei(skr !t)eas(k)es(k): (5.41)
Here the vectors esH(k) andesV(k) are two real polarisation vectors orthogonal both to
each other and the vector kfor any k,sand. These operators are closely related to the
electric eld observable; for instance, one may show that as(k;t) is, like the electric eld,
divergence-less:ras(k;t) = 0. To specify the polarisation vectors more completely we
demand that the unit vectors ( bq1;esH(k);esV(k)) form a right-handed coordinate system.
The horizontally and vertically polarised components of the vector annihilation operator
are given by the localised blip operators asH(r;t) andasV(r;t) respectively.
A fundamental equation of motion
From Section 5.3.1, we know that the blip operators as(r;t) satisfy the second order
wave equation for waves propagating at the speed of light (see Eq. (5.26)). This equa-
tion is unchanged by the transformation s7! s, and therefore does not distinguish a
dierence in the dynamics of light characterised by excitations with dierent values of
s. As theas(r;t) operators are closely related to the electric eld observable, we can
introduce another vector-valued operator bs(r;t) that is closely related to the magnetic
eld observable. We dene the bs(r;t) operators to be those satisfying the following
equation of motion:
ras(r;t) = s
c@
@tbs(r;t): (5.42)
Unlike the wave equation, this equation contains only rst-order derivatives with respect
to time and the role of the parameter scan be seen. The relationship between as(r;t) and
bs(r;t) given in Eq. (5.42) can also be represented by means of a position-independent
superoperator wherebs(r;t) = i[as](r;t). The operator acts on the vector op-
erators in a distributional sense just like the regularisation operator in Eq. (4.19). The
operator, however, mixes together the dierent components of the vector operators. In107
Ref. [50],is referred to as the helicity operator. By calculating the divergence of both
sides of Eq. (5.42) one can show that, like the as(r;t) operators, the bs(r;t) operators
are divergence-less too.
Although dierent from the as(r;t) operators we should bear in mind that the bs(r;t)
operators are not independent of the as(r;t) operators. Both of these operators can be
represented in terms of the as(r;t) blip operators. Consequently, any state containing
as(r;t) energy quanta also contains bs(r;t) energy quanta. Any light pulse containing an
electric component also contains a magnetic component. In particular, whereas the hori-
zontally and vertically polarised components of as(r;t) are superpositions of horizontally
and vertically polarised blips respectively, the horizontally and vertically polarised com-
ponents of the bs(r;t) operators are superpositions of vertically and horizontally polarised
blips respectively. In addition, by calculating the curl of Eq. (5.42) and using Eq. (5.26)
one can show that as(r;t) andbs(r;t) satisfy the equation
rbs(r;t) =s
c@
@tas(r;t): (5.43)
Using thenotation, the above equation may be written as(r;t) =i[bs](r;t). Hence
together Eqs. (5.42) and (5.43) form a closed set of rst-order equations for the as(r;t)
andbs(r;t) operators and 2= 1. We shall use these equations in Section 5.4.3 to
construct a dynamical Hamiltonian in the position representation.
For a given single-blip state j (t)iwe may dene the following vector wave functions:
 E
s(r;t) =h0jas(r;0)j (t)i
 B
s(r;t) =h0jbs(r;0)j (t)i: (5.44)
We may refer to  E
s(r;t) and B
s(r;t) as the electric and magnetic wave functions respect-
ively. Both are divergence-less and represent the probability distribution of a particular
electric and magnetic eld conguration.108
Are blips local?
The blip creation operators ay
s(r;t) dened at dierent positions are orthogonal to one
another and therefore dene perfectly localised particles. One the other hand, no two
components asi(r;t) orbsi(r;t) of theas(r;t) andbs(r;t) operators (where i= 1;2;3
refers to a component in a constant Cartesian basis) possess a bosonic commutation
relation. This result can be shown using Eqs. (5.41) and 5.42. It seems, therefore, that
the components of the vector operators cannot be localised in space. Does this mean
that photons cannot be localised and that we are unable to give an exact description of
photons in the position representation? The answer is emphatically \no."
The components of the as(r;t) andbs(r;t) operators do not have a local bosonic
commutation relation precisely because the operators possess only transverse polarisa-
tions. It is sometimes thought that this implies that the photon cannot be localised. In
this quantisation, however, the principle excitations of the electromagnetic eld in three-
dimensions are the blip operators as(r;t) which do have a local commutation relation as
all momenta are taken into account for each polarisation (see Eq. (5.29)). This is remin-
iscent of the position operator introduced by Hawton [34] which takes into consideration
longitudinally as well as transversely polarised eld components.
By representing any quantum state in a basis of blip states, we can dene its position-
dependent wave function. The vector excitations as(r;t) andbs(r;t) are non-local, but
the position of these non-local excitations is well-dened. The non-local commutation
relations for the as(r;t) andbs(r;t) operators therefore do not represent a quantum
problem founded in an apparent inability to localise the photon; it is a classical prob-
lem brought about by the fact that electromagnetic waves do not form themselves into
point-like objects. In this sense, the energy quanta of the eld behave very much like
the classical solutions of Maxwell's equations. Shortly we shall see that the EM eld
observables are closely related to the vector excitations.109
5.4 The EM eld observables
Hitherto we have constructed a complete Hilbert space for the carrier particles of the
quantised EM eld in position space. These are the localised blips, which are character-
ised by a position r, a timet, a polarisation and an additional discrete parameter s.
Furthermore, we have shown that these blip excitations can be used to construct vector-
valued operators that, like the electric and magnetic eld observables, are divergence-less
and obey the wave equation for vector elds. In this next section we shall complete
the development of the three-dimensional theory of the free EM eld by constructing
the electromagnetic eld observables that act on this Hilbert space and a dynamical
Hamiltonian that determines the evolution of the blips.
5.4.1 Observables in the position representation
Field observables in the position representation
Consistent with the eld observables given in Eq. (5.15) and the vector operator dened
in Eq. (5.41), we assume that the complex electric and magnetic eld observables are a
linear superposition of the as(r;t) andbs(r;t) operators respectively:
E(r;t) =X
s=1cR[as] (r;t)
B(r;t) =X
s=1sR[bs] (r;t): (5.45)
Here as in previous denitions of the eld observables, the blip operators are related
to the eld observables by a position-independent regularisation operator R. Using the
equations of motion (5.42) and (5.43) for the vector operators, it can be shown that the
eld observables dened in Eq. (5.45) satisfy all four of Maxwell's equations (2.8)-(2.11).110
Field observables in the momentum representation
The eld observables in the momentum representation are given by the expressions
E(r;t) =X
s=1X
=H;VZ
R3d3k
(2)3=2c
(k)ei(skr+'(k))eas(k;t)es(k;t)
B(r;t) =X

=H;VZ
R3d3k
(2)3=2s
(k)
!ei(skr+'(k))eas(k;t) (kes(k;t)):(5.46)
This is in agreement with Eqs. (5.41) and (5.42) and the expressions for the eld observ-
ables in Eq. (5.45).
The regularisation operator
Unlike the regularisation operator dened in Section 5.2.3, in Eq. (5.45) the regularisation
operator is not vector valued. Instead, it acts on the vector blip operators to produce the
also vector-valued electric and magnetic eld observables. The regularisation operator
can be understood again in a distributional sense such that
R[as] (r;t) =Z
R3d3r0R(r r0)as(r0;t): (5.47)
Due to the isotropy of free space, the regularisation operator R(r r0) is independent of
sand, and symmetric in its two arguments: R(r r0) =R(r0 r).
5.4.2 The energy observable
Energy in the position representation
Now that we have expressions for the electric and magnetic eld observables, by substi-
tuting these expressions into the classical energy (2.21) we can determine an expression
for the energy observable of the system. After carrying out this substitution one nds111
that
Henergy (t) =X
s=1Z
R3d3r"0c2
8

kR[as](r;t) + H.c.k2+kR[bs](r;t) + H.c.k2	
: (5.48)
Due to the complicated commutation relations between the vector blip operators, this
operator is not in a form that is of much practical use to us. Fortunately we may simplify
this expression further. We should recall that the horizontally and vertically polarised
components of the as(r;t) operators are given by the horizontally and vertically polarised
blip operators respectively. Consequently, in Eq. (5.48), the product as(r;t)as0(r;t) is
given by the expressionP
=H;Vas(r;t)as0(r;t) whereas(r;t) are the usual local blip
operators. Moreover, using the property 2= 1 it may be shown that the total energy
of the magnetic eld is equal to the total energy of the electric eld. Putting both of
these observations together one nds that the energy observable can be written in the
simpler form
Henergy (t) =X
s=1X
=H;V"0c2
4Z
R3d3rfR[as] (r;t) + H.c.g2: (5.49)
This expression is entirely analogous to the energy observable derived for the one dimen-
sional elds in Eq. (4.22). Like the expression for the energy observable in Eq. (4.22),
the above energy observable is always positive, which is ensured by the square in the
integrand.
The regularisation operator revisited
As in one dimension, the regularisation operator plays an important role in specifying
the energy of a blip excitation. In order to determine the exact form of the energy
observable, we must now determine what eect the regularisation operator has on a blip,
or in other words, what is the exact expression for the distribution R(r r0). In Chapter
4, the regularisation operator was determined by ensuring that the eld observables112
transformed correctly under Lorentz boosts. We proceed analogously in this section and
rst determine the eect of the regularisation operator on the photon operator eas(k;t).
The distributionR(r r0) is then determined by Fourier transforming any multiplicative
factor gained in the regularisation of the photon operators.
Consider again a pure Lorentz boost in a given direction denoted by the Greek letter
. This transformation shifts all momenta kto the new momenta p. As before, the
corresponding transformation on the states of the system is implemented by the unitary
transformation U() which ensures that all transition amplitudes are invariant under the
change of reference frame. Using the Lorentz invariant measure d3k=jkjand the photon
commutation relation given in Eq. (5.32), one can show that the inner product between
two normalised photon wave packets is both Lorentz- and form-invariant only when
U()eas(k;0)Uy() =s
jpj
jkjeas(p) (5.50)
up to a unitary rotation of the polarisation states. I shall ignore this rotation in the above
transformation as the anti-symmetric eld tensor transforms correctly to accommodate
this rotation and we are only interested in the overall normalisation of the eld. See
Section 5.9 of Ref. [127] for more details. Using this result one can again show that the
elds transform correctly only when the regularised photon operator is given by
R[eas](k;t) = 
 0p
jkjeas(k;t) (5.51)
for some real and constant numerical factor 
 0. See again Appendix. A for more details.
As we shall see in Section 5.4.3, when restricted to positive-frequency excitations the
energy observable and dynamical Hamiltonian coincide when 
 0is given by

0=r
2~
"0c: (5.52)
For this choice of 
 0the energy expectation value of a single-photon state in the ( k;s;)113
mode is ~jkjc. Moreover, since the regularised blip operator is just the Fourier transform
of the regularised photon operator we can determine that

The nal equality sign has been determined, for example, in Refs. [28, 69] after an
exponential regularisation has been used. The result above again shows that in three
dimensions the eld observables are non-locally related to the blip operators. Given
Eq. (5.53), we have completely determined the eld observables and the energy observable
in the position representation.
5.4.3 The dynamical Hamiltonian
An equation of motion for blips
The two equations of motion (5.42) and (5.43) describe completely the dynamics of the
blip operators in three-dimensions. As these equations are rst-order in time they provide
a suitable starting point for our determining a dynamical Hamiltonian that satises
Heisenberg's equation. The commutation relations for the vector operators as(r;t) and
bs(r;t) are not simple and it is more appropriate therefore for us to express the dynamical
Hamiltonian in terms of the locally bosonic blip operators as(r;t). Hence, to continue,
we must nd a way to express Eq. (5.42) in terms of the local blip operators.
In Eqs. (5.42) and (5.43) there are two dierent types of operator: there are the
as(r;t) operators, and there are the bs(r;t) operators. By comparing Eqs. (5.41) and
(5.31) one can see that in the ( q1;q2;q3) basis theas(r;t) have components
(0;asH(r;t);asV(r;t)). Hence, it is straightforward to represent the as(r;t) operators in
terms of blip operators. The bs(r;t) operators on the other hand are dened entirely by
the equation Eq. (5.42), or, equivalently, related to the as(r;t) operators by a helicity
operator. This relation is not necessarily local as it depends upon the relationship
between the wave vector kand the frequency !for which there are many dierent choices.114
I shall proceed as in Section 5.3.3 where the direction of propagation is indicated by the
vector s=sbq1. As the electric and magnetic elds are therefore related by a rotation
about theq1axis, in the ( q1;q2;q3) basis the components of the as(r;t) andbs(r;t)
operators are related by a rotation. In particular, using the right hand rule and the
expressions for the eld observables given in Eq. (5.45), the components of the bs(r;t)
operators are given by (0 ; asV(r;t);asH(r;t)).
By substituting the above expressions for the vector operators back into Eq. (5.42)
one nds that
r0

asH(r;t)
asV(r;t)1
CCCCA= s
c@

BBBB@0
 asV(r;t)

CCCCA(5.54)
This equation can be solved component-wise by remembering that ( bq1;eH;eV) forms a
right-handed coordinate system and that the blip operators depend on the q1coordinate
only. The above equation (5.54) then reduces to the simpler equation
@
@tas(r;t) = sc@
@q1as(r;t): (5.55)
This equation is completely analogous to the equation of motion (4.12) for light propagat-
ing in one dimension. In Eq. (4.12), the space derivative is with respect to the xcoordin-
ate axis. Here the space derivative is with respect to the q1axis lying either parallel or
antiparallel to the direction of propagation. This equation is general when the direction
of propagation is given by s=sbq1.
The dynamical Hamiltonian
By using the equation of motion (5.55) for localised blip excitations we can now construct
a dynamical Hamiltonian for light in three dimensions. We proceed as before by assuming
that the dynamical Hamiltonian is an exchange Hamiltonian for blips. This operator115
takes the form
Hdyn(t) =iX
s=1X
=H;VZ
R3d3r0Z
R3d3r00~scfs(r0;r00)
ay
s(r0;t)as(r00;t): (5.56)
In the above fs(r0;r00) is complex. To determine fs(r0;r00) we use Eq. (5.56) to calculate
the time evolution of a blip operator and compare the result with the blip equation of
motion: in this case Eq. (5.55). Using Heisenberg's equation and the blip commutation
relations given in Eq. (5.29) we nd that
d
dtas(r;t) =scZ
R3d3r00fs(r;r00)as(r00;t): (5.57)
Hence we may verify that the dynamical Hamiltonian is given by
Hdyn(t) = iX
s=1X
=H;VZ
R3d3r0Z
R3d3r00~sc0(r0 r00)
ay
s(r0;t)as(r00;t): (5.58)
Here0(r0 r00) denotes the derivative of a delta function with respect to q1. By recalling
thatkr=k1q1, Eq. (5.58) can be written in the alternative form
Hdyn(t) =X
s=1X
=H;VZ
R3d3r0Z
R3d3r00Z
R3d3k~k1c
(2)3
eisk(r0 r00)ay
s(r0;t)as(r00;t): (5.59)
As one can see above, the dynamical Hamiltonian in three dimensions also has posit-
ive and negative eigenvalues. This dierentiates it from the dynamical Hamiltonian in
standard quantisations that has only positive eigenvalues.
In Eq. 5.59, the frequency of a photon with wave vector skis given by k1wherek1is
theq1component of k. This is a slightly odd choice of frequency because, as mentioned116
in Section 5.3.3, the unit vector bq1lies on the half-sphere, and there are many such
half-spheres to choose from. This choice of dynamical Hamiltonian is therefore most ap-
propriate when there is a clear overall direction of propagation, as there is, for instance,
for plane waves. One may instead wish to redene bq1such that it covers the entire
unit sphere, which is much more general. Consider the alternative description where
bq1covers the unit sphere, the wave vector is given by k=jkjbq1, and the direction of
propagation is given by s=sbq1. In such circumstances, while Eq. (5.58) is still satised,
the frequency of a monochromatic photon is given by sjkjc. From this alternative form
of the dynamical Hamiltonian we can see that the negative frequency contribution to
the dynamical Hamiltonian arises due to the introduction of the new parameter s. Fur-
thermore, when restricted to positive frequencies only, the energy observable (5.49) and
dynamical Hamiltonian (5.59) coincide. One can also check that the energy observable
commutes with the dynamical Hamiltonian and is therefore conserved.
5.5 Discussion
In Chapter 4, the basic excitations of the free EM eld were a set of bosonic particles
localised to a position along the xaxis that propagate either to the left or the right at
the speed of light. In this chapter we have generalised the results of Chapter 4 in order to
determine a complete set of basis states for the free EM eld in three dimensions that are
both localised and propagate at the speed of light. After an initial attempt to quantise
the eld in terms of localised excitations that have a well-dened direction of propagation,
which we found to be an over-complete description, we introduced a complete set of blip
annihilation operators as(r;t). The corresponding blip states are locally orthogonal to
one another and, in addition to polarisation, are characterised by a discrete parameter
s=1 which doubles the usual Hilbert space.
Unlike in one dimension, where the localised blips have a clear direction of propaga-
tion, in three dimensions a localised blip state contains contributions from photons
propagating along all axes through the point of localisation with a forwards or backwards117
motion determined by the choice of s. This feature is reminiscent of the Huygens-Fresnel
principle in which each point on a wave front acts as a source of spherical waves. This
does mean, however, that highly-localised wave packets will spread out, but they do so
only in accordance with Maxwell's equations.
In Section 5.4.1 we derived expressions for the electric and magnetic eld observables
in terms of the blip operators by means of a position-independent regularisation operator
Rand a set of non-local and vector-valued operators as(r;t) andbs(r;t). By introducing
vector operators we are more easily able to relate the EM elds to the blips or carriers
of the eld. These vector operators are similar to those dened in Ref. [50], but dier
in their dimension, as we make a clear distinction between the elds and the carriers.
As in Chapter 4, the regularisation operator allows us to introduce particle excitations
without sacricing the Lorentz covariance of the eld observables. The expression given
in Eq. (5.53) shows that the relationship between the eld observables and blip operators
is non-local with innite tails. This was also the case for the one-dimensional elds in
Chapter 4. Hence, a single blip generates a non-local eld that can be felt across all of
space.
By expressing the blip operators in terms of monochromatic photon operators eas(k;t),
we have also shown that our approach is consistent with the standard theory up to the
addition of negative-frequency states. The Hilbert space in three dimensions, as in one
dimension, is only doubled, and this doubling takes into account the negative-frequency
states that are usually overlooked. As states of the quantised EM eld now evolve with
negative as well as positive frequencies, the dynamical Hamiltonian and the energy ob-
servable are no longer equal, and the two operators only coincide when restricted to the
subset of positive-frequency states.
The energy observable (5.49) is strictly positive due to the square in the integrand.
This observable also contains pure annihilation and pure creation components that do
not occur in the standard energy observable. As in one dimension, these extra terms
determine the interference that occurs between the more traditional positive-frequency118
excitations and the new negative-frequency excitations. The addition of these terms also
means that single-photon states are not eigenstates of the energy observable. Single-
photon states are, however, eigenstates of the dynamical Hamiltonian (5.59). This is so
because the dynamical Hamiltonian is a recreation operator that annihilates exactly one
excitation and replaces it at a new location. Unlike the energy observable, the dynamical
Hamiltonian has both positive and negative eigenvalues. One can see that by changing
the value of s, the dynamical Hamiltonian changes sign and reverses the apparent ow
of time.Part III

A Fermi problem for light
Fermi's two-atom problem [1] provides an interesting model for studying causality in
quantum electrodynamics. The problem is complicated, however, by the precise manner
in which the atoms and elds are coupled together. In this chapter we study a simpler
but equivalent problem that does not use atoms, involving a beam-splitter and a pair
of photon detectors, in order to determine whether the eld propagates causally or not.
In Section 6.2 we describe this experiment in more detail and study the propagation of
light through the new system. In Section 6.3 we construct a pair of detection operators
representing each detector in the experiment, and show that a causality violation takes
place for light described by the standard theory. In Section 6.4 we show that there is no
causality violation for light when we introduce negative-frequency photons. We conclude
this chapter with a discussion in Section 6.5.
6.1 Introduction: Fermi's original two-atom problem
In empty space, light propagates at a constant and nite speed. The speed of light is
the same for all time-like observers, irrespective of their motion relative to one another
or to that of the light source. In order to ensure the validity of relativity theory, it
is crucial that the speed of light cannot be exceeded by any signal capable of relaying
causal information, or, in other words, any signal capable of relaying to the receiver some

Figure 6.1: A illustration of the expected behaviour in Fermi's two-atom problem. An
atom initially in its excited state drops to its ground state generating a single photon
from the vacuum. The photon propagates to a distant, unexcited atom causing it to
transition into its excited state. The second atom is expected to be found in an excited
state only after a time R=chas passed.
knowledge of the actions of the transmitter. Naturally, this speed limit introduces a lower
bound on the time it takes for particles to propagate from one place to another, and it
is important that this lower bound be apparent in any quantum theory.
In 1932, Fermi published a paper on the quantisation of the EM eld and its interac-
tions with matter [1]. Here he considered the following problem. Consider two identical
atoms separated by some large distance R. Suppose also that one of these atoms is in its
rst excited state whilst the other atom and the pervading EM eld are in their ground
states. After a negligible time the excited atom will decay emitting a single photon that
then propagates towards the second atom. Being in its ground state, the second atom
will absorb the incoming photon and \jump" to its excited state. How long should one
have to wait after the photon is rst emitted until it is absorbed again by the second
atom? In an intuitive picture of this interaction, the energy transferred from the rst
atom is carried by a \ying" photon, as illustrated in Fig. 6.1, that propagates from the
rst atom to the second. Taking causality into consideration, the second atom should
not become excited until a time R=chas passed.
In Ref. [1], Fermi used a perturbative approach to determine the probability of nding
the second atom in an excited state, and found that this probability remains strictly
zero for all times less than R=c. This is the desired and expected result. In Fermi's122
calculations, however, an approximation was used that extended the frequency of photon
states into the negative frequency domain. Shirokov [90] and others [94, 95, 96, 97] have
since pointed out that without making this assumption the solution to Fermi's problem
results in a small but non-zero probability for the second atom to be found in an excited
state before the expected time, thereby violating Einstein causality.
In the years since, many attempts have been made to reconcile the predictions of
special relativity and quantum optical models for the experimental scenario illustrated
in Fig. 6.1, [99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108]. In some of these cases,
however, a causal result is only found due to various approximations and modications
of the standard theory [99, 107], or by looking at the problem from a dierent view
point, for example, Refs. [100, 105] look at the problem from the view point of algebraic
QFT rather than of photon wave packets. Other authors have found that there is no
strict Einstein causality [89, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97], and that there is always a non-
zero probability of immediately exciting the second atom. In these cases, however, there
is no superluminal signalling as this probability does not depend on the presence of
the rst atom, but is instead attributed to vacuum correlations between the two atoms
[91, 92, 94, 96]. Hence, there is no causal relationship between measurements at the two
atoms. Such a result, however, is closely related to the particular choice of the coupling
between the EM eld and the two atoms, or upon the nal states of the eld and source
atom [91, 94]. For instance, In Ref. [91], causality is preserved only when one refrains from
applying the rotating wave approximation, the validity of which is also investigated in
[107, 171]. Unfortunately, due to the expected non-causal eects in the original two-atom
Fermi problem being very weak, it is very dicult to verify their presence experimentally
[98].
By taking a wider view of the Fermi problem and not focussing solely on the atom-
eld interaction, Hegerfeldt demonstrated that the violation of strict causality is a result
of the fact that the system Hamiltonian is bounded below [89, 93]. This is a direct result
of Hegerfeldt's theorem [72], which states that, under a projective measurement, a single-123
photon wave packet initially localised to a nite region will spread out immediately. The
work in Ref. [93] has been criticised in relation to the validity of the measuring process and
the fact that possible loopholes must be treated with adequate care [100, 103, 105]. For
instance, in Ref. [103], the probability of exciting the second atom is not represented as a
projective measurement and Hegerfeldt's conclusions are therefore avoided. Nevertheless,
in a position wave function approach to quantum optics, Hegerfeldt's theorem appears
to demonstrate that photons can propagate at superluminal speeds.
In summary, although there appears to be no superluminal signalling between the
two atoms in Fig. 6.1, it is unclear whether there is any evidence of a causality violation
or not. The results on this topic vary and are intimately related to the particular way
in which the atom and eld are coupled together; however, the existence of superluminal
correlations would seem to suggest that photon wave packets may be able to propagate
at speeds exceeding the speed of light. The work of Hegerfeldt suggests that the presence
of atoms is not crucial to the calculations that predict non-causal behaviour. In this
chapter, therefore, we analyse a simpler but analogous problem to Fermi's two-atom
problem involving a beam-splitter and two spatially localised detectors. We nd in this
chapter that single-photon wave packets described in the standard quantum theory do
not propagate as would be expected for a localised light pulse. When expressed as a
superposition of blip operators, however, localised single-photon wave packets propagate
causally.
6.2 An alternative experiment
The alternative experimental setup that we shall consider in this chapter is illustrated
in Fig. 6.2. In this section we shall construct an analogy between Fermi's original two-
atom system and our experiment in order to determine how a causality violation may
be veried. We shall also describe the propagation of light through the beam-splitter.
Initially we shall only consider positive-frequency photon states, as are present in stand-
ard quantisations, but later in this chapter we shall consider the propagation of both the124
positive-frequency and negative-frequency photons described in Chapter 4.
6.2.1 Our experiment
The interferometer in Fig. 6.2 consists of a source of spatially-localised ultra-broadband
light pulses [147, 148, 149, 150] aimed at a beam-splitter, and a pair of photon detectors
positioned along the output trajectories of the beam-splitter. We denote the detector at
the end of the vertical arm Detector 1 and the detector at the end of the horizontal arm
Detector 2. We assume that the separation between the beam-splitter and Detector 2 is
much greater than that between the beam-splitter and Detector 1.

L1L1
L2L1
Figure 6.2: An interferometer consisting of a beam-splitter and two photon detectors.
A short pulse of light approaches the beam-splitter from the left and is then diverted
towards the two detectors. The distance from the beam-splitter to Detector 1 is L1and
the distance from the beam-splitter to Detector 2 is L2L1. In relation to Fig. 6.1,
region 1 corresponds to the rst atom whereas region 2 corresponds to the second atom.
In the original formulation of Fermi's two-atom problem, the photon leaves the rst
atom at the time the system is turned on and the atom begins to decay. The photon then
arrives at the second atom the moment we rst register a non-zero probability of nding
the second atom in an excited state. The dierence between these times is the photon
travel time from which a speed is calculated. In the interferometer system illustrated in
Fig. 6.2, all photons will initially be emitted by a source to the left of the beam-splitter.
Upon reaching the beam-splitter, some photons will be directed towards Detector 1 and
the rest towards Detector 2. Due to the presence of the beam-splitter, the positions125
of photons propagating along the vertical and horizontal arms of the interferometer are
highly correlated, and a signal at Detector 1 will notify us of the position of the remaining
photons in the horizontal arm to within a width of the wave packet.
After passing through the beam-splitter, the two output wave packets have the same
wave function as the initial wave packet entering the beam-splitter. If Detector 1 has
a particular probability of clicking at a time t1, then, assuming that all wave packets
propagate at the speed of light, the probability for a subsequent click at Detector 2 at
a timet2must be directly proportional to the initial probability for Detector 1 to click
after taking into account a short time delay caused by the dierence in the distances
from the beam-splitter to the detectors. More specically, when the photon wave packets
propagate at the speed of light, the two probabilities must be directly proportional when
t2=t1+ (L2 L1)=c (6.1)
Furthermore, there must be a zero probability for Detector 2 to click before a sucient
time has elapsed after Detector 1 has clicked.
This type of causality, in which correlations cannot be generated at speeds exceeding
the speed of light, is known as Einstein Causality. From the point of view of localised
photon wave packets, if a wave packet propagates at the speed of light, correlations
cannot be generated at speeds exceeding the speed of light. This experiment specically
tests Einstein causality, hence a verication of causality is possible by ensuring that the
probabilities for Detectors 1 and 2 to click obey the relationship described above. In
this chapter we carry out these calculations for photons in both the standard and blip
descriptions of light.
The model we propose here oers a simpler theoretical model for studying possible
causality violations in a way that can be realised in a laboratory. In this experiment there
is a clear signature for the beginning and the end of the photon's journey in the form
of the detector clicks. This is well dened in the theory and in a possible experiment.
Furthermore, the nature of the coupling between photons and atoms does not need to be126
discussed or justied.
6.2.2 Light in the interferometer
We next describe the propagation of a short photon wave packet through the beam-
splitter illustrated in Fig. 6.2 by introducing a unitary scattering operator S(t). We use
the standard description of photon wave packets in this section, but a generalisation to
our new quantisation is easily made later on.
One-dimensional systems
In the experimental setup illustrated in Fig. 6.2, we consider light propagating along
two perpendicular arms of an interferometer. In each arm of the interferometer, light
propagates either towards or away from the beam-splitter independently of what is going
on in the other; if we ignore the eect of the beam-splitter that is. In reality, the photon
wave packets travelling along each arm would be localised in the plane orthogonal to their
direction of propagation, but as there is no interference between light in the two arms of
the interferometer except at the beam-splitter, it is sucient for our purposes to treat
light in the interferometer as two distinct one-dimensional systems: one system describing
light propagating along the vertical arm, and the other describing light propagating along
the horizontal arm. States in dierent arms occupy distinct regions of the total Hilbert
space. We shall proceed next to construct wave packets of light in one dimension in
preparation for our discussion on the beam-splitter in Section 6.2.4.
Single-photon wave packets
In the quantised theory of the free EM eld, the stationary solutions of Maxwell's equa-
tions are associated with a set of bosonic particles which form the basic energy quanta
of the system. In Section 3.2, these energy quanta are associated with the running wave
solutions of Maxwell's equations in one dimension. This approach is particularly well
suited for modelling light in the experimental setup considered in Fig. 6.2 which is con-127
cerned with light propagating in one direction only. In this chapter we shall consider
again the set of creation and annihilation operators associated with light propagating in
one dimension with a single frequency and a given polarisation, ay
kandak. The mag-
nitude and sign of kdenote the frequency divided by the speed of light and the direction
of propagation respectively.
As in Section 3.2.2, a single-photon wave packet is a linear superposition of the single-
photon excitations generated by applying the ay
kcreation operators to the vacuum state.

Using Eq. (6.4) and the commutation relation (3.14) one can check that asatises the

= 1 when the state is properly normalised
according to Eq. (6.3). To construct a many-photon state we proceed as in Section 3.2.2.
In this chapter we consider wave packets for any general set of coecients cn. We can
then afterwards examine particular choices of these coecients.
6.2.3 The dynamics of photon wave packets
The dynamics of a state in the Hilbert space can be determined by proceeding as in
Section 3.1 and solving the Schr odinger or Heisenberg equation. In standard descriptions128
of the quantised EM eld, the Hamiltonian is given by the energy observable (3.16). This
is in contrast to the quantisations developed in Chapters 4 and 5 where the dynamical
Hamiltonian determines the time-evolution of the system. For simplicity, we work in the
Heisenberg picture that was described in Section 3.1.3.
By Solving Heisenberg's equation with the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (3.16), the single-
photon annihilation operator for a time-dependent state is given by
a(t) =U(t;0)aUy(t;0) =X
=H;VZ1

HereU(t;0) = exp( iHt=~) is the usual free-space time-evolution operator of the quant-
ised EM eld.
Suppose that the EM eld has initially been prepared in the many-particle state j i,
which we introduced in Eq. (3.20) for the single-photon operators dened in Eq. (6.5).
The state at a later time tis found in an equivalent superposition of number states con-
structed in an analogous way using the time-evolved annihilation operator a(t) dened
in Eq. (6.5). To show this we substitute the identity id = Uy(t;0)U(t;0) between
each time-independent creation operator in the many-particle state and use the rela-
tionU(t;0)j0i=j0i. This leads to the expression

6.2.4 The beam-splitter
The Hilbert space of the beam-splitter system
The purpose of the beam splitter in Fig. 6.2 is to split any incoming wave packets into
two parts that will propagate along the vertical and horizontal arms of the interferometer
respectively. To distinguish the photons in the vertical arm from those in the horizontal129
arm, we denote the annihilation operators of the latter by bkand the former by ck. The
total single-photon Hilbert space is then given by the direct sum of HbandHc,HbLHc,
which are the single-photon Hilbert spaces for photons in the horizontal and vertical
arms respectively. Since the single-photon states j1(b)
ki=by

independently, they must be orthogonal to one another. This implies that

wherei=b;c. All other commutators vanish. Thus the bkandckoperators obey the
usual bosonic commutation relations.
Next, in analogy to Eq. (6.4), we construct annihilation operators bandcfor norm-

kck: (6.8)
The time evolution of the corresponding single-photon operators can be determined by
solving Heisenberg's equation (4.23). The Hamiltonian of the total system is given by
the sum of two harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians of the type given in Eq. (3.16): one in
terms of the bkoperators, and the other in terms of the ckoperators.
Scattering operators
As an initial state passes through the beam-splitter, a superposition of bandcstates
will be produced. The eect of this splitting on an initial state j in(0)ican be described
with the help of a scattering operator S(t;0). After passing through the beam-splitter,
the state of the outgoing light at a time tis given by
j out(t)i=S(t;0)j in(0)i: (6.9)130
As the time-evolution of a state before and after passing through the beam splitter is
the same, it does not matter when the wave packet is split into two parts. Without any
restrictions, we can therefore assume that
S(t;0) =SU(t;0); (6.10)
whereSsatisfyingSSy=SyS= 1 is a unitary scattering operator. In the case of a

6.3 Photon detection in the interferometer
In this section we construct two detection operators that represent the measurement of
a photon by Detectors 1 and 2 in Fig. 6.2. Interpreting the photon wave function as
the probability amplitude for detection, Detectors 1 and 2 are represented by a pair of
projection operators. Later in this section we shall calculate and compare the probab-
ilities for Detector 1 to click at a time t1, and for Detector 2 to click at a later time t2
conditional to the earlier click at Detector 1. We then show that a causality violation
takes place in the standard theory of the quantised EM eld. For simplicity, and since
it does not aect our conclusions, from now on we shall only consider light with a single
xed polarisation . This could be achieved by placing a polarising lter in front of the
detectors or behind the source.
6.3.1 Detection operators
When light enters a detection device, it will be absorbed by the device and cause a click
at a given time twith a particular probability Pclick(t). The act of detecting a photon is
represented by a detection operator acting on the Hilbert space. In this chapter we shall
assume that the detection operator represents an ideal measurement on the eld and that
we therefore do not need to pay any attention to the internal mechanism of the detecting
device. Furthermore, we shall assume that our photon detector is a perfect detector,
although the experiment would work equally well with a less ecient detector. This
implies that a light pulse entering the detector will be detected with absolute certainty,
and that the detector will never produce a false reading. When a detector makes a
measurement on a eld, it does so with respect to a particular measurable characteristic
of the eld. In this chapter, the characteristic of interest is the position of a photon.
The detector is designed to respond to any photon that comes within the bounds of the
detecting equipment and not otherwise.
As localised particles are represented by the locally bosonic position eigenstates of
a system, the detector responds to the position eigenstates of the eld that lie within132
the detecting region. In spite of this, the detection operator does not usually coincide
with the position observable in that region. Rather the detection operator projects onto
the eigenstates of the position observable with a particular probability. This probability
represents the belief that the projection onto a position eigenstate indicates a photon
at that position [172]. Since we are assuming that our detectors are perfect detectors,
this belief is an absolute certainty. We therefore associate a unit probability with each
projector. The resulting mathematical structure of our detection operator is a projection
valued measure associated with every possible region of space. A projection valued
measure is suitable for a detection operator because, for any excited state, the probability
of a detection is always positive and there is a unit probability of nding a photon
somewhere in space.
In the following the probability for a detector to click Pclick(t) at a timetis determined
by calculating the expectation value of the projection operator Pdetect (t) also at a time t
with respect to the state of the light incident on the detector. As the detection operator
is positive, any chance to detect a photon always results in a non-zero expectation value.
Using the idempotent property of the projection operator, P2=P, the expectation value
of the detection operator with respect to a state j iis equal to the square magnitude
of the projection operator acting on that state. Hence, the probability of the detector
clicking at a time tis given by
Pclick(t) =kPdetect (t)j (0)ik2=kPdetectj ( t)ik2(6.14)
where the projection operator Pdetect is dened at t= 0. In the remainder of this section
we identify appropriate detection operators P(1)
detectandP(2)
detectfor Detectors 1 and 2 in
the setup shown in Fig. 6.2 and calculate their respective detection rates.133
6.3.2 Detection operators in the interferometer
Localised single-photon wave packets
The rst step in constructing the appropriate detection operators is to identify a set of
position eigenstates for light in the two arms of the interferometer onto which states will
be projected. As discussed in the introduction of this thesis, the task of constructing
localised photon states in quantum theory has been beset with diculties. Indeed, Part
II of this thesis is dedicated to constructing a local theory of the free quantised EM eld.
In this section, we shall construct localised states in the standard Hilbert space (Section
3.2) in the manner of Mandel [68, 69] and Cook [66, 67]. There are several reasons
for considering these states as the localised photon states. First of all, these states are
locally orthogonal to one another, which is consistent with our denition of localised
states in Chapters 4 and 5. Furthermore, their inner product has the correct dimensions
to be interpreted as a probability density, and, in one dimension, the position-dependent
number operator represents exactly the photon number density operator [68].
According to this denition, we dene a pair of localised single-excitation states
j1b(x)iandj1c(y)iin the following way:
j1b(x)i=1p

relate to the non-local single-photon states by
kj0iandcy
kj0ivia a Fourier transform and
describe localised single-photon wave packets at positions xandyalong the horizontal
and vertical axes respectively. There are no other eld excitations anywhere else in the
system.134
Number-resolving detectors
For simplicity, in the setup shown in Fig. 6.2 we shall assume that our detectors are
number-resolving detectors and designed such that they only react to single-excitation
states, i.e. states which can be obtained by applying a local photon creation operator,
Eq. (6.15), to the vacuum state. This experiment could also be done with non-number
resolving detectors, but since contributions from dierent number states are purely addit-
ive and positive, any violation of causality that occurs for the number-resolving detectors
would also be present for more general single-photon detection operators.
We shall dene a pair of detectors that each have a nite length Dand respond
only to photons within this range. The detection operators project onto the single-
photon subspace of photons spanned by the states (6.15) that lie within the region of
the detectors. For convenience we also suppose that the beam-splitter is positioned at
the origin of both the xandycoordinate axes. Consequently, Detector 1 extends from
L1toL1+Dand Detector 2 extends from L2toL2+D. The detection operators may
therefore be written as
P(1)
detect=ZL1+D
L1dyj1c(y)ih1c(y)j;
P(2)
detect=ZL2+D
L2dxj1b(x)ih1b(x)j: (6.16)
Using the denition of the localised excitations in Eq. (6.15), one may check that ( P(i)
detect)2=
P(i)
detectfor bothi= 1;2.
Signalling between detectors
Using the commutation relations in Eq. (6.7) one may verify that any operator that
acts only on the b-photons in the horizontal arm will always commute with any operator
that acts only on the c-photons in the vertical arm. It is important that observables on
the dierent arms of the interferometer commute with each other as this implies that
the probability of measuring a particular outcome of an experiment on the b-photons is135
statistically independent of any operation carried out on the c-photons and vice-versa.
In other words, the frequency of a particular result occurring when the b(c)-photons
are measured does not depend on any experiment performed on the c(b)-photons. This
includes the measurements performed by Detectors 1 and 2.
The statistical independence of measurements on the two arms of the interferometer
does not, however, prohibit correlations existing between the b- andc-photons. In fact,
this experiment relies on the strong correlations between photons in each arm as these
correlations provide a relation between the expected times of arrival of a photon in each
of the detectors. When one detector clicks, if the light pulse is very short, a click at the
second detectors cannot be far behind. The fact that the position observables in the two
arms of the interferometer commute is important because, although there are correlations
between the b- andc-photons, it means that a detection in one detector cannot either
hurry along or hold o a detection in the other: the probability of detection in each will
be unchanged. Therefore, by making a measurement at Detector 1 we set for ourselves
an expected time of arrival for a photon to arrive at Detector 2 (assuming propagation
atc), but do not change the independent trajectory of light towards that detector. This
ensures that we are calculating the speed of a light pulse when unobserved.
6.3.3 Probability of a detection
Detector 1
We now consider the probability for Detector 1 to detect exactly one photon at some
timet1and the probability for Detector 2 to detect exactly one photon at a later time t2
conditional on the earlier click at Detector 1 at time t1. In the following, the probability
for Detector 1 to click will be denoted P(1)
click(t1). The probability for Detector 2 to click
will be denoted P(2)
click(t2).
As the scattered light leaves the beam-splitter, the quantum state for the component
of light seen by Detector 1 at a time t1is given by the projection of the detection
operatorP(1)
detectonto the output state j out( t1)idened in Eq. (6.13). The probability136
for Detector 1 to click is then, according to Eq. (6.14), given by the square magnitude of
the resulting state. Using the expression for the output state j out( t1)iin Eq. (6.13)
and the detection operator for Detector 1 in Eq. (6.16), one nds that the probability
for Detector 1 to click at a time t1is given by
P(1)
click(t1) =1
21X
n=0jcn+1j2
2nn!ZL1+D
L1dykh1c(y)jcy( t1)j0cik2: (6.17)
When the coecients cnare chosen for a coherent state (see Eq. (3.21)), one may show
thatP
n=0jcn+1j2=2nn! =2exp[ jj2=2].
Detector 2
The state seen by Detector 1 was given by j out( t1)ispecied in Eq. (6.13). On the
other hand, once a click has been registered by Detector 1, the state seen by Detector 2
is given by
j out( t2)i=U( t2; t1)P(1)
detectj out( t1)i
kP(1)
detectj out( t1)ik1=2: (6.18)
This state is normalised. To determine the probability for Detector 2 to click, one pro-
ceeds analogously to the previous calculation by applying the detection operator P(2)
detect
to the output state j out( t2)i. The squared magnitude of the resulting state gives the
probability of detection. Using Eqs. (6.18) and (6.13), and both detection operators in
Eq. (6.16) one nds that
P(2)
click(t2) =jc2j2
4 1X
n=0jcn+1j2
2nn!! 1ZL2+D
L2dxkh1b(x)jby( t2)j0bik2: (6.19)
This probability depends solely on the two-photon contribution of the initial output state
in Eq. (6.13). This is because both detectors will only register a photon if there is exactly
one photon in each arm of the interferometer. It is therefore only the two-photon part
of the output state that contributes to Eq. (6.19).137
Transition amplitudes
By expressing the single-photon creation operators and the localised photon states in
their Fourier representations, we may show that the transition amplitudes within the
modulus signs in Eqs. (6.17) and (6.19) are equivalent to the integral expressions
h1b(x)jby( t2)j0bi=1p
2Z1
 1dke i(kx cjkjt2) k;
h1c(y)jcy( t1)j0ci=1p
2Z1
 1dke i(ky cjkjt1) k (6.20)
for the particular that we have chosen for this output state. If the initially prepared
incoming wave packet contains photons with positive konly, the above transition amp-
litudes depend on y ct1andx ct2respectively. This is as one would expect for light
moving towards the two detectors.
6.3.4 Causality violations in the standard theory
We now study our expressions for the detection probabilities (6.17) and (6.19) and show
that a causality violation takes place when using the standard description of single-photon
wave packets.
Expected results
The probability for Detector 2 to click at a time t2conditional on a previous click by
Detector 1 at a time t1was given in Eq. (6.19). In order to determine whether causality
is satised, let us look more closely at the rst transition amplitude in Eq. (6.20) that
appears in Eq. (6.19). By decomposing the transition amplitude into its Fourier com-
ponents, and making the substitutions x=y+L2 L1andt2=t1+ (L2 L1)=c, we
nd that
h1b(x)jby( t2)j0bi=1p
2Z1
 1dke i(ky cjkjt1)e i(k jkj)(L2 L1) k (6.21)138
By comparing this result with the transition amplitude in Eq. (6.20) we can see that the
two expressions are almost identical. The only dierence here is that the amplitude in
Eq. (6.21) contains an additional exponential term.
Recall here that causality applies when the probabilities P(1)
click(t1) andP(2)
click(t1+
(L2 L1)=c) are proportional to each other. This occurs only when the second line of
Eq. (6.20) and Eq. (6.21) are also proportional to each other. As the Fourier transform
of any absolutely integrable function is unique [155], we can conclude that the two trans-
ition amplitudes in Eq. (6.20) are proportional, and in fact equal, only when the second
exponential in Eq. (6.21) vanishes altogether. This occurs on only two occasions: when
L1=L2, or whenk=jkj. Next we shall examine these conditions in more detail in order
to determine the characteristics of the system or state under which causality is preserved.
An inconsistency with Einstein's relativity
Let us rst consider the condition that L2=L1. It was asserted at the beginning of
the chapter that the horizontal arm of the interferometer was much longer than the
vertical arm. This implies that L2L1and therefore that the detectors do not click
at the same time. Hence, we can immediately disregard this condition and assume that
L16=L2. The second condition states that k=jkjand, therefore, that ktakes positive
values only. In the standard theory of the quantised EM eld, the sign of kindicates the
direction of propagation. In this experiment, light propagates in a single direction away
from the beam-splitter and towards the detectors. The above condition, then, is only the
statement that the state under consideration ought to contain contributions only from
photons propagating towards rather than away from the detectors. On rst inspection
this condition seems to be one that we can accept perfectly well. We should not, however,
be too hasty with our conclusions. Let us have a closer look at Eq. (6.2) which is the
general expression for a single-photon wave packet.
The photon wave packet propagates causally only when we neglect the negative k
terms. These wave packets are dened in Eq. (6.2) by changing the limits of the integral139
from ( 1;1) to [0;1) or by replacing the momentum-dependent wave function  k
with(k) kwhere(k) is the Heaviside step-function. Using the denition of perfectly
localised states given in Eq. (6.15), the position-dependent wave function of a state is
given by the Fourier transform of the momentum-dependent wave function. The Fourier
transform of the wave function (k) kis non-zero at all positions for all allowed choices
of k. Consequently, a single-photon wave packet that propagates in a single direction
cannot be localised completely to a nite region, but must be spread out across all
available space.
At the beginning of this chapter we asserted that the photons entering the inter-
ferometer were initially localised somewhere to the left of the beam-splitter. This is a
condition that could be imposed by introducing a shutter mechanism in front of the
beam-splitter. Since this assumption implies that the photon wave packet contains con-
tributions from all wave numbers, we must also disregard the second causality condition.
Thus, we nd that, in the standard description of the quantised EM eld, localised wave
packets do not propagate at the speed of light, and correlations do form at superluminal
speeds. In the language of single-photon wave functions, this implies that photon wave
packets may propagate at speeds exceeding the speed of light, and consequently that
either causality is violated or there does not exist a wave function that represents the
position of a single photon propagating through space. In the following section we shall
examine whether this dilemma may be resolved by describing the light propagating along
each arm of the interferometer as a system of blips.
6.4 Resolving causality issues with blips
By carrying out similar calculations as in the previous section, in this section we demon-
strate that localised photon wave packets propagate causally when described as a system
of blips. We also discuss causality of the eld observables.140
6.4.1 An argument for negative-frequency photons
In the previous section we have shown that, in the standard theory of the quantised EM
eld, single-photon wave packets cannot simultaneously be localised and propagate at the
speed of light. This problem arises because causality applies only when the frequency of
all photons involved is equal to their wave number multiplied by the speed of light. Since
localised wave packets necessarily contain photons with both positive and negative wave
numbers, and frequency is strictly positive, this can never be the case. In Chapter 4 of
this thesis we introduced blip excitations in one dimension. We discovered, however, that
blip excitations contain contributions from photons that evolve with negative as well as
positive frequencies. This suggests that, if the quantised eld is described in terms of
blip excitations, causality may be preserved for local excitations.
Hence, in this section, we shall consider again the interferometer experiment de-
scribed in the introduction of this chapter. This time, however, we shall model the EM
eld propagating along the arms of the interferometer as two distinct systems of one-
dimensional blips. To continue we shall rst describe the scattering of blip excitations
by the beam-splitter and construct detection operators appropriate for detecting blips at
the desired locations. We shall then repeat the calculations carried out in Section 6.3.3
in order to determine whether the blip wave packets propagate causally or not.
6.4.2 Scattering operators for blips
In this experiment we shall, as before, assume that the photon is localised somewhere to
the left of the interferometer. The initial state of the system is given by
j in(0)i=Z1
 1dx s(x)ay
s(x;0)j0i (6.22)
Since the wave packet approaches the beam-splitter from the left we shall assume that
 s(x) = 0 when s= 1, or, in other words, the initial wave packet only contains blips
that propagate to the right. We shall also assume that the wave function  s(x) is non-141
zero only in a small region to the left of the beam-splitter and for a single polarisation
.
As in Eq. (6.9), the output state of the beam-splitter is determined by acting upon the
input state with a unitary scattering operator Sthat splits the incoming wave packet into
two components. The annihilation operators for blips propagating along the horizontal
arm are denoted bs(y), whereas those propagating along the vertical arm are denoted
cs(x). As before, these excitations are distinct, and all commutators between band
ccreation and annihilation operators are zero. The scattering operator is modelled
completely analogously to Eq. (6.11) which was dened for monochromatic photon states.
This transformation leaves both the wave number and polarisation unchanged, but we
shall now also assume that the parameter sis unchanged by the scattering transformation.
The two output wave packets therefore propagate away from the beam-splitter. The
output state is then given by Eq. (6.13). In this case, however, the time-dependent
excitations are given by
b(t) =Z1
 1dx 
s(x)bs(x;t)
c(t) =Z1
 1dy 
s(y)cs(y;t) (6.23)
respectively. The bs(x;t) andcs(x;t) operators independently satisfy the blip commut-
ation relations given in Eq. (4.17).
6.4.3 Detecting blips in the interferometer
Detection operators
We consider now a pair of number-resolving detection operators that respond to single-
blip states located within the detecting regions L1toL1+Dup the vertical arm and L2
toL2+Dalong the horizontal arm. Here we shall drop the sandsubscripts because we
assume that all the light reaching the detector propagates away from the beam-splitter
and is polarised in a single direction. The assumption that light reaching the detectors142
propagates in only one direction is based upon the fact that the photon source is to the
left of the beam-splitter. As the blip excitations are locally orthogonal to one another,
the appropriate detection operators are given just as in Eq. (6.16). Here, however, the
single-excitation states j1b(x)iandj1c(y)iare generated by acting upon the vacuum state
with the blip operators by
s(x;0) andcy
s(y;0) for the values sandselected by the wave
function s(x).
Detection probabilities
We are now in a position to calculate the probabilities for Detectors 1 and 2 to click
at the times t1andt2respectively. As before, the probability for Detector 1 to click
is evaluated by rst evolving the beam-splitter output state backwards in time by a
timet1, and then taking the expectation value of the new projection operator P(1)
detect.
The resulting probability P(1)
clickis given by Eq. (6.17). In the new expression, however,
the local states and operators within the transition amplitude are the local blip states
and operators, and not the local states dened in Eq. (6.15). Using the time-dependent
inner product given in Eq. (4.15) and the annihilation operators given in Eq. (6.23), the
probability of nding a blip at Detector 1 at a time t1is now given by
P(1)
click(t1) =1
21X
n=0jcn+1j2
2nn!ZL1+D
L1dyk (y ct1)k2: (6.24)
We can now see, by looking at the square of the wave function, that the probability
of detecting a blip is equal to the probability of nding a blip in a region of length D
shifted along from Detector 1 by a length ct1. Thus, there is only a non-zero probability
to detect a blip at Detector 1 if the wave packet is initially a distance of ct1away from
the detector, as we would expect.
Next, let us calculate the probability of nding a second blip at Detector 2 at a
timet2. After a detection has been made at Detector 1, the remaining output state is
again given by Eq. (6.18). After evolving the state backwards to a time  t2, we then
calculate the expectation value of the second detection operator P(2)
detect. The conditional143
probability for Detector 2 to click at a time t2is given by
P(2)
click(t2) =jc2j2
4 1X
n=0jcn+1j2
2nn!! 1ZL2+D
L2dxk (x ct2)k2: (6.25)
This expression can be written in an alternative form by making the substitution y=
x L2+L1, which is always true due to our choice of detector placement. We shall also
examine the particular case where t2=t1+ (L2 L1)=c. We choose this time because
it is the time we would expect a light signal to take to travel from a distance L1to a
distanceL2. The resulting expression for P(2)
click(t2) is given by
P(2)
click(t2) =jc2j2
4 1X
n=0jcn+1j2
2nn!! 1ZL1+D
L1dxk (y ct1)k2: (6.26)
One can see by cross-examining Eqs. (6.24) and (6.26), that the probabilities of nding
a blip in Detector 1 at a time t1and a blip in Detector 2 at a time t2=t1+ (L2 L1)=c
are directly proportional to each other. In both cases the overlap between the wave
function and the detector regions are identical, as we would expect after taking causality
into consideration. Thus, when the quantised EM eld in one dimension is described
using blips, the position-dependent wave functions all propagate at the speed of light.
6.4.4 Causality of eld observables
In Section 6.3.4 we demonstrated that, when described using the standard theory (see
Section 3.2), single-photon wave functions cannot be simultaneously localised to a nite
region of space and propagate at the speed of light. This is a slightly puzzling and ap-
parently contradictory result considering that the electric and magnetic eld observables
are solutions of the wave equation for waves propagating at c(Eq. (2.16)). In fact, some
authors claim that, in the context of algebraic quantum eld theory, the fact that the
eld observables obey this wave equation is enough to demonstrate that no causality
issues can occur [100, 105]. The problem of innite propagation speeds, however, is not
directly related to the propagation of the electric and magnetic eld observables.144
In the Heisenberg picture, the electric and magnetic eld observables in one dimension
are given, as in Eqs. (3.31) and (3.32), by the expressions
E(x) =cZ1
 1dks
~jkj
4Ac" 0eikx ijkjct[akHby+akVbz] + H.c.;
B(x) =Z1
 1dks
~jkj
4Ac" 0eikx ijkjctsgn(k) [akHbz akVby] + H.c. (6.27)
Let us now calculate the expectation value of these eld observables with respect to a
horizontally polarised coherent state containing on average jj2photons dened by the
wave function  kH. Taking into account Eqs. (3.20) and (3.21), one can show that
hE(x;t)i=cZ1
 1dks
~jkj
4Ac" 0eikx ijkjct 
kHby+ c.c.;
hB(x;t)i=Z1
 1dks
~jkj
4Ac" 0eikx ijkjctsgn(k) 
kHbz+ c.c. (6.28)
Restricting the wave function to a single polarisation does not aect the generality of
this result.
In these expressions, as before, positive and negative kcorrespond to left- and right-
travelling waves. In these expressions one can see that at a time t= 0 the expectation
values of the eld observables can have any distribution in space we like, even localised
ones. This is the case because there are no restrictions on  kHfor anyk. What is less
obvious is that these expectation values can have any distribution in space at any time
and propagate at the speed of light even if kis restricted to only positive or negative
values. Unlike the expectation values of the projection operators, when restricted to
only positive values of kwe nd that the additional complex conjugate term completes
the missing frequency terms to create localised wave packets with a denite direction of
propagation that do not disperse as time evolves. Hence, the expectation values of the
electric and magnetic elds are complete solutions of Maxwell's equations that propagate
both to the left and the right at a speed c.145
Although the electric and magnetic eld expectation values propagate causally for
positive frequency states, the expectation values of the detection operators do not because
they measure only the complex part of the eld. They do, however, propagate causally
for states containing both positive- and negative-frequency photons. To see that this is
so consider the position operator acting on the single-blip Hilbert space below:
X=X
s=1X
=H;VZ1
 1dxxj1s(x)ih1s(x)j: (6.29)
The blip states are the eigenvalues of this observable. After evolving this operator in time
with respect to the dynamical Hamiltonian (4.29), the time-dependent position operator
is given by
X(t) =X
s=1X
=H;VZ1
1dx(x+sct)j1s(x)ih1s(x)j: (6.30)
The eigenvalues of the position operator are the same at all times. As time advances
they are displaced by a distance sctas would be expected for a localised photon.
If the position states in Eq. (6.29) are replaced by the localised states given in
Eq. (6.15) and the system evolved forward in time using the one-dimensional gener-
alisation of Eq. (3.16), the time-dependent position operator is given by
X(t) =X
=H;VZ1
 1dk1Z1
 1dk2g(k1;k2;t)j1(k1)ih1(k2)j: (6.31)
where
g(k1;k2;t) =Z1
 1dxxei(k1 k2)x+i(jk1j jk2j)ct: (6.32)
The localised states j1(x)iare not the eigenstates of the above operator for any non-zero
time.146
6.5 Discussion
When two identical atoms, one in an excited state and one in its ground state, are coupled
to the electromagnetic eld, the excited atom will emit a photon that is absorbed at a
later time by the second atom. It is often found that there is a non-zero probability for
the second atom to become excited immediately after the coupling is turned on, but as
this probability is independent of the rst atom, it is not usually interpreted as evidence
of superluminal propagation from the rst atom to the second. This result, however, does
not depend on the use of atoms. For this reason, in this chapter we have considered an
alternative causality experiment that uses a beam-splitter and a pair of number-resolving
photon detectors positioned along the output ports of the beam-splitter as illustrated in
Fig. 6.2.
The results of this chapter show that in the standard theory of the quantised EM eld
a state initially localised to the left of the beam-splitter has a non-zero probability of
causing a click at either of the detectors at a later time. In fact, Detector 2 may register
a click long before a photon is received by Detector 1. In this experiment a click at either
detector must correspond to a measurement of the state initially localised to the left of
the beam-splitter. In the standard quantisation of the free EM eld, therefore, localised
photon states propagate at speeds exceeding the speed of light. This is in agreement with
the results of Hegerfeldt [72] and Malament [73]. As the two detection operators dened
in Eq. (6.16) commute with one another it is impossible for an observer at Detector 1 to
send a message to an observer at Detector 2 by taking measurements with his detector.
It is then possible to say that there is no causality violation because this experiment
does not examine the propagation of causal information. Nevertheless, the results in
this chapter clearly demonstrate that the localised states dened in Eq. (6.15) disperse
lling all space immediately. This result cannot be accepted if we are to construct a local
theory of photons.
We have also shown in this chapter that when the eld is modelled in terms of
blips, localised photon wave packets propagate at the speed of light. In particular, the147
probability of detecting a photon at Detector 2 conditioned on an earlier detection made
by Detector 1 is directly proportional to the initial probability of Detector 1 clicking once
an appropriate delay has been taken into consideration. In Section 6.3.4 we found that
causality only applies when the photon wave number (multiplied by c) and frequency are
equal. The problem of innite propagation speeds can therefore be overcome by removing
the lower bound on the Hamiltonian, as was done in Chapters 4 and 5 of this thesis, but
also in Refs. [53, 55, 110, 161, 162, 163, 164, 168, 173]. In spite of this, theories that
are restricted to positive eld Hamiltonians are by far the most prevalent in standard
quantum physics textbooks [123, 124, 127, 130, 131]. In Ref. [91], the superluminal
contribution to the excitation probability of the second atom was attributed, not to a
\ying" photon, but to the vacuum uctuations of the EM eld. Our results are in
partial agreement with this conclusion, as we have also shown that such correlations
have nothing to do with the use of atoms but with the current description of the EM
eld. Here, however, we do not see this as a reason to excuse these correlations, but as
a justication that an alternative description of the eld is needed.
This chapter has provided an important verication that the blip theory oers a more
intuitive means of describing photon wave packets than the standard theory in realistic
experimental scenarios. In particular the results of this chapter conrm that negative-
frequency states are a necessary part of the construction of photon wave packets. The
existence of negative-frequency modes is fundamental to a variety of amplication eects
including Penrose superradiance [174], which has recently been measured in a non-linear
optical system [175], and the production of Hawking radiation by a black hole [176] or
Unruh radiation in an accelerating reference frame [177]. In these instances, however,
amplication occurs due to a conversion from modes with a negative norm to those with a
positive norm. The positive-frequency and negative-frequency parts of the blip's Fourier
spectrum discussed in this chapter both have a positive norm and so do not relate to
these eects. Modes with a negative norm do still exist in our new theory in addition to
the newly introduced negative-frequency photon states. In order to study eects such as148
the Unruh eect we would need to study whether negative-norm states can be converted
to positive-norm states in this new theory.
The results of this chapter provide a good indication that the blip theory will prove
a useful tool for studying quantum eects in the position representation. In this next
chapter we shall investigate the behaviour of blips in a one-dimensional cavity and a
three-dimensional cavity. By studying light inside a cavity in the position representation
we hope to gain a new perspective on the origin of the Casimir eect.Chapter 7
The Casimir eect
In this chapter we provide an alternative derivation of the Casimir force between two
parallel, perfectly reecting mirrors in both one and three dimensions using the local
theory of photons constructed in Chapters 4 and 5. We recover the usual textbook
expressions for the Casimir force as an exact result without the need for regularisation
procedures. In Section 7.2 we investigate the propagation of blips near a perfect cavity
in one dimension and construct a corresponding set of eld observables. In Section 7.3
we show that the zero-point energy of the eld inside the cavity diers from its usual
expression by a convergent term that depends on the width of the cavity. This additional
term leads to an attractive force between the mirrors. In Section 7.4 we repeat these
calculations for the case of a perfectly reecting cavity in three dimensions. We similarly
nd that there is an attractive force between the two plates in agreement with standard
results. We conclude this chapter with a discussion in Section 7.5.
7.1 Introduction: The Casimir eect
The Casimir eect refers to the attractive force between two parallel and highly reecting
mirrors in a vacuum [178]. Since its initial discovery the Casimir eect has received a
lot of attention in the literature [179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184], and, despite not having
a counterpart in classical electrodynamics, recent experiments conrm its predictions
149150
[185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190]. Nevertheless, there is still some controversy surrounding the
origin of this eect [191, 192, 193]. For example, the standard derivation of the Casimir
eect requires regularisation procedures to be used before identifying a nite contribution
to the zero-point energy of the EM eld that depends on the mirror separation D[128].
Moreover, the standard derivation simply assumes that the plates restrict the quant-
ised EM eld inside the cavity to standing waves with a discrete set of resonant fre-
quencies. In these standing wave mode models one cannot take into account from which
direction light enters an optical cavity and therefore cannot reproduce the typical be-
haviour of Fabry-Perot cavities which have maximum transmission rates for resonant
light [194]. Discrete mode models also imply that no light is permitted inside a cavity
with mirror separations well below typical optical wavelengths, which would appear to
contradict recent experiments with nano-cavities [195]. Special care must be taken in
these circumstances, however, as the modes excited inside the cavity are often described
as nano-gap plasmonic modes, which lie on the surface of the cavity walls. The plas-
mon wavelengths are always smaller than the free-space optical wavelengths allowing an
enhancement of light inside very small cavities. To fully capture all aspects of optical
cavities, an alternative approach to the Casimir eect is needed.
In Chapters 4 and 5 of this thesis we introduced a quantisation of the one- and three-
dimensional EM eld in the position representation. A description such as this lends itself
naturally to the modelling of locally interacting quantum systems, like a cavity, and other
quantum optics experiments [149, 196]. In the blip descriptions, the EM eld is viewed
as a collection of localised energy quanta described by the local operators as(x;t) and
as(r;t). These operators avoid the previous localisability issues as the associated energy
quanta are completely localised in space (see Eqs. (4.17) and (5.29)). Moreover, as was
shown in Chapter 6 for the one-dimensional excitations, because these excitations evolve
according to a dynamical Hamiltonian that has both positive and negative eigenvalues,
these states propagate at the speed of light without dispersion.
The purpose of this chapter is to use the local theories developed in Chapters 4151
and 5 to model the behaviour of the quantised EM eld between two parallel mirrors
and re-derive the Casimir eect in both one and three dimensions. Instead of imposing
boundary conditions by demanding that the electric eld amplitudes vanish at the mirror
surfaces and restricting the EM eld inside the cavity to standing waves, in this chapter
we realise boundary conditions in a dynamical fashion by looking at how blips propagate
near a cavity. The results of this chapter will provide a more intuitive description of
the Casimir eect and will support the validity of the local eld quantisation approach
to light-matter systems. As the calculations involved in the derivation of the Casimir
eect in one and three dimensions are very similar, the most part of this chapter will be
dedicated to the one-dimensional eect. The derivation of the three-dimensional eect
will be shorter as many of the relevant discussions carry over.
7.2 Light inside an optical cavity
In this section we describe the propagation of blips both inside and outside a one-
dimensional cavity using the mirror image method of classical optics. By applying the
regularisation operator of Chapter 4 to a blip near the cavity and its mirror images, we
determine an expression for the eld observables near the cavity.
7.2.1 The propagation of blips near a one-dimensional mirror
In free space, blips propagate along the boundaries of the light-cones as illustrated in
Fig. 1.3. In such a system the blips propagate away from the source at the speed of light
and never change their direction. Let us now consider a single mirror placed at some
point along the xaxis. For convenience we shall choose this point to be the origin x= 0.
We shall name the region to the left of the mirror Region I, and the region to the right
of the mirror Region II. In this chapter we shall treat all mirrors as classical objects that
interact locally with light. The mirrors we are describing are perfect mirrors that reect
all incident light. As blips are the local energy quanta of the EM eld, it is the blips
that interact locally with the mirror. Therefore, when away from the mirror the blips152
evolve as if in a vacuum; when in contact with the mirror, the blips are reected by the
mirror and their direction of propagation is reversed ( s7! s). The trajectory of a blip
initially approaching the mirror from the left along with its mirror image is illustrated
in Fig. 7.1.
xt
0
Figure 7.1: The gure depicts the world-line of a single blip interacting with a perfect
mirror placed at the origin. The blip, initially approaching from the left, propagates
freely until it reaches the mirror at which point the direction of propagation is reversed.
While the incoming blip is characterised by s= 1, the outgoing blip is characterised
bys= 1. A blip initially approaching from the right would behave analogously, the
reection implementing the transition from an s= 1 blip to an s= 1 blip. The
translucent trajectory on the right-hand side of the mirror shows the mirror image of the
reected blip.
Since the mirror is perfect and light therefore cannot pass through it, a blip that is
initially localised to the left of the mirror will remain to the left of the mirror for all time.
The reection of light from the left-hand side of the mirror can therefore be modelled
entirely with the use of blips localised in Region I. Since the light changes direction when
it interacts with the mirror, blips characterised by s= 1 ands= 1 are required to give
a full account of this interaction. In particular, the reection process would be described
by an interaction Hamiltonian of the kind studied in Ref. [110] that would transform a
blip characterised by a direction sinto another characterised by  s. In this chapter,153
however, for simplicity we shall describe the trajectory of the blip using the mirror image
method of classical electrodynamics.
Looking more closely at Fig. 7.1, one can see that the combination of the blip being
reected from the left and its mirror image are equivalent to the superposition of two blips
propagating in free space, that is, as if the mirror were not there. The two trajectories
cross at the origin. Whereas the blip propagating towards the mirror is dened by
the operator as(x;t), its mirror image is dened by the operator as( x;t). Denoting
the operators for blips to the left and the right of the mirror aI
s(x;t) andaII
s(x;t)
respectively, it is therefore possible to express these operators conveniently as
aI
s(x;t) =XI(as(x;t) +as( x;t))
aII
s(x;t) =XII(as(x;t) +as( x;t)): (7.1)
In the above the as(x;t) operators are the free-space blip operators. Expressing the
aI
s(x;t) andaII
s(x;t) operators as a superposition of the free-space blip operators is
particularly useful as we already know the commutation relations for the free operators.
In Eq. (7.1), the operator XItells us to neglect all blips located to the right of the mirror
for all times. This eectively removes the translucent trajectory in Fig. 7.1 leaving only
the physical trajectory. The operator XIItells us to neglect all blips located to the left
of the mirror for the same reason.
Note nally that the mirror image method is not needed to describe the propagation
of light near a double-sided mirror in the blip formalism [110]. We use the mirror image
method only for convenience. However, whereas one would usually need both parameters
s=1 to describe the behaviour of light at either side of the mirror, using the mirror
image method, the entire world-line of the blip near the mirror is described using only
a single value of s. Therefore, from now only we need only make use of one value of s.
Which value doesn't matter so we shall just leave this parameter as s.154
7.2.2 The propagation of blips near a one-dimensional cavity
To construct a cavity system we place two double-sided mirrors at points along the xaxis
a widthDapart. For symmetry purposes we assume that the leftmost mirror is placed at
x= D=2 whilst the rightmost is placed at x=D=2. The two mirrors partition the real
line into three regions. The region to the left of the cavity spanning all x< D=2 shall
be denoted Region I, the region between the mirrors spanning  D=2<x<D= 2 shall be
denoted Region II, and the region to the right of the cavity spanning all x>D= 2 shall
be denoted Region III. As there are now two mirrors, there will be many more mirror
images to take into consideration in order to describe blips both inside and outside the
cavity. We now look at how to construct the appropriate blip operators in terms of the
free-space blip operators just like we did in Eq. (7.1)
Blips outside the cavity
Consider a single blip propagating towards the cavity from the left. The blip will propag-
ate freely until it comes into contact with the leftmost mirror. As these mirrors are perfect
there is no chance of a blip penetrating the mirror. Consequently all blips in Region I are
unaected by the mirror forming the right-hand wall of the cavity. Therefore, the blips
to the left of the cavity propagate as if there were only one mirror, just as illustrated in
Fig. 7.1. Blips in region III behave analogously. We can therefore express the blips in
Regions I and III in a manner very similar to Eq. (7.1). Denoting blips in Regions I and
IIIaI
s(x;t) andaIII
s(x;t) respectively, and taking into account the new position of the
mirrors we nd that
aI
s(x;t) =XI(as(x;t) +as( D x;t))
aIII
s(x;t) =XIII(as(x;t) +as(D x;t)): (7.2)
As before the operators XIandXIIIremove contributions that are outside their desig-
nated regions.155
Blips inside the cavity
Inside the cavity a single blip will bounce backwards and forwards between the two
mirrors for all time. This motion is illustrated in Fig. 7.2. This is true for any size cavity
as blips are innitely well localised and therefore guaranteed to t inside the cavity. The
trajectory of blips inside the cavity diers therefore from that of those on the outside.
As a blip inside the cavity is reected an innite number of times there is an innite
number of mirror images that must be taken into consideration. These can be imagined
by extending the world-lines of the blips in Fig. 7.2 through the cavity walls. Taking
these reections into consideration we nd that the blip operator for a single blip placed
inside the cavity is given by the expression
aII
s(x;t) =XII1X
n= 1(as(x+ 2nD;t ) +as((2n 1)D x;t)): (7.3)
The operationXIIdisregards all blips located outside Region II for all times. The innite
sum is representative of the innite number of reections made by a blip inside the cavity.
7.2.3 The propagation of the EM eld near a cavity
The Casimir eect arises due to changes in the zero-point energy of the EM eld as the
cavity width is varied. The energy of the system is determined by the elds, so in this
section we shall investigate how the eld observables are altered by the presence of a
cavity.
In Chapters 4 and 5, the bosonic blip operators are related to the eld observables by
means of a regularisation operator R. In both cases the regularisation operator is highly
non-local (see Eqs. (4.56) and (5.53)). The eld measured at a single point therefore
depends on the distribution of blips across all of space. We have seen, however, that
when a mirror is introduced to the system all blips are reected, which prevents them
from reaching the other side. A mirror, therefore, will eectively shield an observer
on one side of the mirror from all blips present on the other. When such an observer156
xt

Figure 7.2: The gure shows the world-line of a single blip placed inside a cavity. A blip
initially propagating to the left will meet the right-hand mirror and be reected to the
left. At a later time the same blip will meet the left-hand mirror and be reected again
causing it to propagate to the right. This process continues indenitely. Light initially
inside the cavity remains inside for all time, and light initially outside the cavity remains
outside for all time.
measures the eld observables on their side of the mirror, they ought not to be aware of
any blips on the other side. For this reason, all eld observables measured on one side
of a mirror cannot depend on blips on the other. This is one consideration that must
be taken into account. We must also remember that the cavity walls are not dull but
perfectly reecting. Therefore it is not only the blips on the correct side of the mirror
that contribute to the eld observables, but all of their mirror images too.
As the eld observables dened in either Region I, II or III can only depend on blips
dened in that same region, and must also depend on all of their mirror images, the eld
operators dened in either one of these regions is simply the regularisation of the photon
operatorsaI;II;III
s(x;t) that we dened earlier. Conveniently, as the regularisation oper-
ators in both one and three dimensions are symmetric, the regularisation of the mirror
images is equal to the mirror images of the regularisation. Hence, the eld observables
near a cavity are determined by taking the mirror images of the free eld observables.
Unlike the blip operators that only become aware of the mirror when the two come into157
contact, as the eld observables are non-local, the elds at all locations are changed quite
signicantly by the presence of the two mirrors. In particular, by taking into account the
mirror images of the elds both inside and outside the cavity, the non-local eld observ-
ables are folded over onto themselves many times forming a concertina shape. This is
illustrated for the eld observables both inside and outside the cavity in Fig. 7.3. In the
remainder of the section we shall determine explicit expressions for the eld observables
near a one-dimensional cavity.

c d
Figure 7.3: [173] a.The diagram shows the amplitude of the electric eld observable
generated by a single blip shown by the grey dot. As the regularisation operator Ris
non-local, local blip excitations contribute to local electric and magnetic eld expectation
values everywhere along the xaxis. b.Since a blip on one side of a highly reecting
mirror cannot contribute to the eld expectation value on the other side, its eld con-
tribution must be reected back on itself. This eect alters the electric and magnetic
eld observables in the presence of a mirror. c.In the presence of two highly-reecting
mirrors, blips outside the cavity cannot contribute to eld expectation values on the
inside. Moreover, the eld contributions of blips on the inside need to be reected as in
the case of one mirror. Now, however, the eld contributions must be folded innitely
many times. d.By comparing two cavities of dierent sizes we see that the behaviour
of the elds inside the cavity is dependent on the cavity width.
Outside the cavity
In the previous section we failed to mention that every time light is reected by a perfect
mirror, the eld observables gain a unitary phase factor. In this section we choose a mirror158
that applies a factor of  1 and +1 to the electric and magnetic elds respectively. As we
calculate the mirror images of the elds we must remember to include these additional
phase factors. Taking into account all mirror images, the eld observables in Region I
are given by
OI
s(x;t) =XI(Os(x;t)Os( D x;t)): (7.4)
Here Os=Es;Bsrefers to the free eld observables dened in Eqs. (4.18) and (4.53),
and thesign applies to the electric and magnetic elds respectively.
In Eq. (7.4), the operation XIrestricts the Hilbert space to blips characterised by x
in Region I only. This ensures that blips outside of Region I cannot contribute in any
way to the elds in Region I as both are separated by a perfect mirror. After substituting
into Eq. (7.4) the expressions for the free eld observables dened in Eq. (4.18) and using
the regularisation operator given in Eq. (4.56), one nds that

Inside the cavity
Inside the cavity we must take into consideration an innite number of mirror images
that each contribute to a section of the zig-zagging trajectory illustrated in Fig. 7.2.
Analogous to Eq. (7.3), the expressions for the total eld observables inside the cavity
are given by

We now have a complete set of operators for the electric and magnetic eld observables
inside and outside the cavity.
7.3 The Casimir Eect in one dimension
In this section we use the eld observables derived in the previous section to calculate the
zero-point energy of the eld near the cavity. We nd that the zero-point energy of the
eld inside the cavity is given by the usual free-space expression plus a D-dependent term
caused by the interference of the eld's innite tails. This leads to the usual expression
for the Casimir force in one dimension.
7.3.1 The vacuum energy of the cavity
Now that we have determined the eld observables in the presence of a cavity we can
calculate the total energy of the EM eld inside and outside the cavity. The purpose of
this section is to determine whether the zero-point energy of the eld changes as the cavity
widthDvaries and, if so, determine an expression for the accompanying Casimir force.
As the eld observables now contain one or more mirror images, the expression for the
energy observable will become very complicated. Fortunately many of these expressions
disappear when we take the vacuum expectation value. Therefore in this section we shall
calculate the zero-point energy of the elds directly. The rst step is to calculate the
zero-point energy of the EM eld both inside and outside the cavity.161
Outside the cavity
The electric and magnetic elds to the left of the cavity are given by the observables
EI
s(x;t) and BI
s(x;t) expressed in Eqs. (7.5) and (7.6). We only use the eld observables
dened for one value of sin this expression, as these eld observables describe the entire
world-line of the blips. The energy observable in Region I is obtained by substituting the
above eld observables into the classical expression for the eld energy given in Eq. (2.21).
As the elds dened in Region I only contain contributions from blips also in Region I,
this energy observable is indierent to blips in Regions II and III as we planned.
After taking the vacuum expectation value of the resulting energy observable and
using the blip commutation relation in Eq. (4.17), one nds that the zero-point energy
of the eld to the left of the mirror is given by

The nal equality holds for x06=x00only. Using the identity above we can show that

The above expression is properly dened as the Fourier transform given in the rst line of162
Eq. (7.14). This term is divergent and the factor under the integral sign is independent
ofD. This term corresponds to the innite zero-point energy of the eld in Region I.
The total vacuum energy of the elds to the right of the cavity is found in the same
way by calculating the expectation value of the energy observable dened for the EIII(x;t)
andBIII(x;t) eld observables given by Eqs. (7.8) and (7.9). By an almost identical set
of calculations one nds that

The zero-point energy density to the right of the mirror is exactly the same as the
zero-point energy density to the left of the mirror. This would be expected due to the
symmetry of the system.
The vacuum energy inside the cavity
Inside the cavity the process is just the same. After calculating the energy observable
for the EII
s(x;t) and BII
s(x;t) elds dened in Eqs. (7.11) and (7.12), one nds that the

This term can be simplied to a single line by a series of substitutions. There are several
steps to this substitution, so for clarity in this section we set the full calculation apart in163
Appendix C. After performing the mentioned substitutions we nd that

The second line in Eq. (7.18) follows from the rst by making the substitution x7!
x+ 2nD. To make the transition from the second to the third line we should rst look
at the expression m n. As bothnandmrun between 1 and1, for each xed value
ofn,m nalso takes all values between  1 and1. Therefore, it does no harm to
simply replace m nwithm. At this point, the sum over all nhas the sole eect of
stretching the limits of the xintegral, which now covers the entire real line. We are now
in a position to apply the identity given in Eq. (7.14) to Eq. (7.18). We then nd that

7.3.2 Divergent contributions to the total zero-point energy
The expression in Eq. (7.19) is the total zero-point energy of the quantised EM eld
inside the cavity. As might be expected, this expression is divergent. The divergent
term, however is easily identied as the term for which m= 0. We can separate this

The second term in this expression is convergent and will be examined shortly. For now
we shall investigate more closely the divergent contribution to the total zero-point energy
inside the cavity. Let us look again at the nal line of Eq. (7.18). If we compare the
m= 0 contribution to this expression with the nal line of Eq. (7.13) we can see that the
two are identical apart from the limits of the integration over x. The divergent zero-point
energy density inside the cavity is therefore just the usual zero-point energy of the free
elds in the region between x= D=2 andx=D=2. We can therefore rewrite Eq. (7.20)
in the form
HII
ZPE=HII(free)
ZPE ~c
2D1X
m=11
m2: (7.21)
A rough physical argument can be given as to why the m= 0 contribution corresponds
to the zero-point energy of the free elds if we look again at Eq. (7.18). The mthat
appears in Eq. (7.20) and the nal line of Eq. (7.18) corresponds to the dierence between
nandmin the rst line of Eq. (7.18). As nandmhere refer to the components of the
elds that have been reected 2 nand 2mtimes respectively, the m= 0 contribution
to the zero-point energy of the eld given in Eq. (7.20) is the contribution to the total
vacuum energy caused by the interference between components of the elds that have
been reected an equal number of times. In part (d) of Fig. 7.3 one can see that the
eect of the mirrors is to fold the non-local eld amplitudes back in on themselves when
they meet the cavity walls. If this diagram were unfolded we would recover part (a) of
the same gure. The interference, then, between components of the eld amplitudes that
have been folded an equal number of times corresponds exactly to the interference of the
free elds with themselves. The dierence between the former and the latter is only that
the rst set of elds have been scrunched up into a cavity.
Them6= 0 contributions to Eq. (7.21), however, correspond to interference between
eld amplitudes when one of the elds has been folded at least twice more than the other;
this is only possible inside a cavity. Moreover, the greater the number of reections that
separate two contributions to the EM eld observables, the larger mand the smaller their
contribution to the total zero-point energy. Next we examine more closely the remaining165
correction to the free zero-point energy.
7.3.3 The Casimir force
Using our expressions for the zero-point energy of the EM eld inside and outside the
cavity we can now determine whether a Casimir force exists. To do so we calculate how
the total zero-point energy of the system changes as the width of the cavity is varied.
From Eqs. (7.15) and (7.16) we know that the vacuum energy density in Regions I and
III, which is given by the usual expression for the free eld zero-point energy density, is
independent of the cavity width and therefore does not contribute to an overall Casimir
force. In Region II the zero-point energy density is given by the usual cavity-independent
expression with a D-dependent correction. In the position representation, as can be seen
in Eq. (7.21), it is easy to separate the D-independent free eld contribution from the
D-dependent correction. Hence, the total Casimir force on the mirrors is given by the
formula
FCasimir = @ECasimir
@D(7.22)
whereECasimir is the correction to the zero-point energy inside the cavity. By substituting
in our value for the Casimir energy ECasimir in Eq. (7.21), we nd that
FCasimir = ~c
2D21X
m=11
m2: (7.23)
This force is D-dependent and nite. The sum in Eq. (7.23) is the convergent Basel sum
equal to2=6. Hence we nd that
FCasimir = ~c
12D2: (7.24)
This is exactly the predicted Casimir force for photons with two possible polarisations.
This force is attractive and varies with the second negative power of D[197].166
7.4 The Casimir eect in three dimensions
In this section we investigate the propagation of three-dimensional blips near two innite,
at and parallel mirrors. In a similar manner to Section 7.2, we determine the appropriate
expressions for the eld observables near the cavity, and then use these expressions to
calculate the zero-point energy of the system. The geometry of the cavity in this system
is very similar to the one-dimensional cavity described in Section 7.2.2. For this reason
many of the methods and results used in Sections 7.2 and 7.3 will be used again in this
section. We nd that the zero-point energy of the eld inside the cavity is given by its
free-space value with the addition of a D-dependent correction. This result leads to the
usual expression for the Casimir force in three dimensions.
7.4.1 The propagation of the EM eld near a cavity
In three dimensions, the basic energy quanta of the EM eld are the localised as(r;t) ex-
citations. These excitations are completely localised and propagate without obstruction
until they come into contact with the mirrors. At this point the blips will be reec-
ted changing their direction of propagation. To dene this motion we shall again use the
method of mirror images. This also means that only one value of sis required to describe
the entire trajectory of the blips near a cavity.
The eld observables, on the other hand, are not localised, but depend upon the
conguration of blips across all space. In this section we must therefore make sure that
blips hidden at one side of a mirror cannot inuence the measurement of the elds at the
other side. Moreover, the mirror images of the blips in one particular region must also
contribute to the eld observables in that region. As in Section 7.2.3, the resulting elds
can be determined by superposing the contributions from all the mirror images of the
eld observables in each particular region. This will be our starting point in this section.167
Outside the cavity
Consider two innite, at and perfectly reecting mirrors positioned parallel to each other
a distanceDapart. We shall work in an orthogonal Cartesian system of coordinates such
that the two mirrors lie in the y-zplane. For symmetry purposes we shall assume that
one mirror is positioned at x= D=2 and the other at x=D=2. It is convenient again
to refer to the regions to the left of the cavity, inside the cavity, and to the right of
the cavity as Regions I, II, and III respectively. As the mirrors are perfectly reecting,
no blips can penetrate the mirrors. Consequently, blips initially found in Regions I, II,
or III will remain in those regions for all time. As before we must remember that upon
reection the electric eld observables gain a phase factor  1 whereas the magnetic elds
gain a phase factor +1.
In Region I the elds have only a single mirror image reected about the mirror
placed atx= D=2. Analogous to the eld observables given in Eq. (7.4) one nds that
the eld observables in Region I are given by
OI
s(x;y;z;t ) =XI(Os(x;y;z;t )Os( D x;y;z;t )): (7.25)
In the above Os=Es;Bsrefer to the free eld observables dened in Eq. (5.45) and
the operatorXIrestricts the Hilbert space to blips dened in Region I only. Here also
the negative sign applies to electric elds and the positive sign to magnetic elds. After
substituting in the expressions for the free eld observables (5.45) and the explicit form
of the regularisation operator in Eq. (5.53) one nds that

cavity. The vector r0
 1= ( x0 D)bx+y0by+z0bzis the position vector of the mirror
image of r0in the left-hand mirror.
In Region III the elds are similarly dened once we have taken into account the new
position of the mirror. In this case one nds that
OIII
s(x;y;z;t ) =XIII(Os(x;y;z;t )Os(D x;y;z;t )): (7.28)
Here also the negative sign applies to the electric eld and the positive sign to the
magnetic eld, and the operator XIIIrestricts the Hilbert space to blips dened in Region
III. After substituting the free eld observables into the above expression one nds that

1= ( x0+D)bx+y0by+z0bzis now the position
vector of the mirror image of r0in the right-hand mirror.169
Inside the cavity
Finally, in region II the eld observables are given by the expression
OII
s(x;t) =XII1X
n= 1(Os(x+ 2nD;y;z;t )Os((2n 1)D x;y;z;t )): (7.31)
The operatorXIIIrestricts the Hilbert space to blips dened in Region III only. The eld
observables inside the cavity contain innitely many image terms due to the innitely
many mirror images each blip has. In this instance, after substituting in the free eld
observables one nds that

In the above r0is dened as before. The vector r0
2n= (x0 2nD)bx+y0by+z0bzis the
position vector of the mirror image of a blip that has been reected 2 jnjtimes. Positive n
applies when the rst reection is o the right-hand mirror, and negative nwhen the rst
reection is o the left-hand mirror. The vector r0
2n 1= ( x0 (2n 1)D)bx+y0by+z0bz
is the position vector of the mirror image of a blip that has been reected an odd number
of times. In this case, n > 0 applies to blips that have been reected 2 n 1 times,
initially o the left-hand mirror. Terms for which n0 applies to blips that have been
reected (2n 1) times, the rst reection being o the right-hand mirror.170
7.4.2 The vacuum energy of the cavity
We are now in a position to calculate the vacuum energy both inside and outside the
cavity. As before, the energy observable in each region is determined by substituting the
eld observables into the classical expression of energy for that region. We shall also
calculate the vacuum expectation value of the energy observable directly without writing
out the full operator itself.
Outside the cavity
After substituting the eld observables in Region I (Eqs. (7.26) and (7.27)) into the
expression for the total eld energy to the left of the cavity and taking the vacuum
expectation value, one nds that

energy to the left of the cavity is given by

The areaAis the area inhabited by the eld in the y-zplane. This term is divergent, as
can be seen by substituting r0=r00into the rst line of Eq. (7.35), and the term under the
integral sign is independent of D. This term corresponds to the innite zero-point energy
of the eld to the left of the cavity and is completely analogous to the one-dimensional
result found in Eq. (7.15).
In Region III the calculation follows almost identically. In this region we nd the
similar result

As would be expected from symmetry arguments, the zero-point energy density of the

Inside the cavity
Inside the cavity we calculate the zero-point energy in the same way. After substituting
the eld observables given in Eqs. (7.32) and (7.33) into the classical expression for the
energy and calculating the vacuum expectation value, we nd that

is analogous to the expression for the zero-point energy inside a one-dimensional cavity
given in Eq. (7.17). The two terms are alike due to the similar geometries of both
cavities. To simplify Eq. (7.38) we can therefore proceed exactly as before by making
the substitutions described in Appendix C and the paragraph beneath Eq. (7.18). The
resulting expression for the zero-point energy inside the three-dimensional cavity is then172

7.4.3 The Casimir force
The zero-point energy derived in Eq. (7.40) contains the addition of two terms: one di-
vergent term and one convergent term. The divergent term can be immediately identied
as the one for which m= 0; let us look at this term more closely. Compare the nal
line of Eq. (7.34) and the m= 0 contribution to Eq. (7.39). By noting that r0
2m=r0
whenm= 0, we can see that the energy density in both terms are equal. The m= 0
contribution to Eq. (7.40) is just the divergent zero-point energy of the free elds. We
may therefore rewrite Eq. (7.40) in the form
HII
ZPE=HII(free)
ZPE ~cA
82D31X
m=11
m4: (7.41)
This expression is equal to the sum of the usual D-independent free eld contribution to
the zero-point energy and an additional D-dependent correction. As before, the negative
correction to the zero-point energy is caused by the interference between two components
of the electric and magnetic elds where one component has been reected at least twice
more than the other.
To determine the total Casimir force on the mirrors we use the formula given in173
Eq. (7.22). As the only D-dependent contribution to the total zero-point energy density
is the correction term to the zero-point energy inside the cavity, the Casimir energy in
this calculation is given by the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. 7.41. This
generates a force acting from the inside of the cavity. Using this expression we nd that
the Casimir force per unit area is given by
FCasimir = 1
A@ECasimir
@D= 3~c
82D41X
m=11
m4: (7.42)
The innite sum is well known and corresponds to the Riemann zeta function of argument
4. This sum is given by 4=90. Hence, we nd that the Casimir force per unit area
between two innite parallel mirrors is given by
FCasimir = ~c2
240D4: (7.43)
This value is identical to the usual result found by other methods for light with two
distinct polarisations [192, 198, 199]. The resulting expression describes an attractive
force that pulls the two mirrors together and increases with the negative fourth power of
the mirror separation.
7.5 Discussion
The Casimir eect is usually calculated by examining changes to the standing modes
formed inside a perfect cavity. From this point of view only those modes with a wavelength
less than twice the width of the cavity are permitted inside the cavity. Moreover, addi-
tional regularisation procedures must be applied in order to wrestle the expression for
the zero-point energy of the eld into a form where corrections caused by the cavity
can be examined. In this chapter we have shown that the usual well-known Casimir
forces in one- and three-dimensional cavities are an exact result that can be calculated
by considering the propagation of localised energy quanta both inside and outside the174
cavities.
In both one and three dimensions the primary excitations of the EM eld, blips, are
entirely localised. The blips t perfectly inside cavities of any width and move around
as if in a vacuum until coming into direct contact with the mirrors. From this point of
view, light is treated as a collection of small particles that interact with the cavity like
classical point-like particles. As blips are constructed by superposing monochromatic
photons of all frequencies, there are no restrictions on the frequency of light that can
be injected into the cavity, even if the cavity is exceptionally narrow. By viewing the
monochromatic photons as only a tool for constructing localised wave packets we can
see that more appropriate boundary conditions can be applied just by specifying the
trajectory of a blip.
Although the blip excitations are localised, the electric and magnetic eld observables
have a non-local dependence on the conguration of blips, which is implemented by the
regularisation operator R. As a result, the electric and magnetic elds are altered by the
presence of the cavity at positions far removed from the mirrors themselves. In particular,
as the two mirrors are highly reecting, a single blip inside the cavity contributes to the
electric and magnetic elds many times due to the many mirror images that that blip
has. These changes were implemented by taking the mirror images of the eld observables
both inside and outside the cavity (see Sections 7.2.3 and 7.4.1). In this description, the
Casimir eect arises due to interference between the reected components of the highly
non-local eld observables that must be folded back into the cavity many times over.
This result also helps us to understand certain characteristics of the resulting force.
For example, looking again at Fig. 7.3, we can see that, since the elds decrease the further
one moves from the unregularised blip, contributions that have been folded the most
contribute the least to changes of the eld observables. This can be seen in Eqs. (7.23)
and (7.42) where the greater mbecomes the smaller the contribution to the overall force.
Moreover, by comparing parts (c) and (d) of Fig. 7.3, one can see that the closer together
the mirrors become, the more the reected components contribute to the eld inside the175
cavity. Hence, as the mirrors are moved closer the force between the mirrors increases.
The methods used in this chapter provide a particularly intuitive way of deriving
the Casimir eect. By piecing together the classical world-line of localised particles
inside a cavity we can calculate the zero-point energy of the eld in a way that easily
distinguishes any divergent contributions without the need for regularisation procedures
or approximations [192], and gives a more natural understanding of the physics at play.
This approach is therefore very well suited to investigations into Casimir forces in cavities
with dierent geometries, lossy or partially transparent mirrors, and even inhomogeneous
materials or curved space-times.Chapter 8
Discussion
In this thesis we refer to single-photon wave packets as the set of excitations associ-
ated with the normalised annihilation operators asatisfying the commutation relation
[a;ay] = 1. It is usual to construct these wave packets by superposing linear combinations
of the orthogonal and non-normalisable excitations associated with the monochromatic
plane wave solutions of Maxwell's equations. These excitations are non-localised and
are characterised by a single wave vector kand polarisation =H;V, each carrying
an energy ~jkjc. In this thesis we have taken an alternative approach and constructed
single-photon wave packets from a set non-normalisable bosonic particles that have a
well-dened position in space-time, so-called blips. In the past it has been thought that
localised excitations of the quantised EM eld do not exist [21]; however, here we over-
come existing no-go theorems by distinguishing between localised particles and the eld
observables themselves.
In the classical theory of the free EM eld in one dimension, localised wave packets
propagate in both directions at the speed of light without dispersion. By considering a
set of highly localised single-photon wave packets in one dimension we have pointed out
that an additional discrete parameter s=1 is needed in order to describe the unitary
evolution of short light pulses that behave in an analogous way. States characterised by
dierent values of smust be orthogonal to one another in order to distinguish between
176177
the dierent dynamics of left- and right-propagating photons. As we demonstrated in
Section 6.3.4, in standard quantisations of the EM eld that neglect this additional
parameter, single-photon wave packets do not propagate causally but spread out lling
all of space immediately. When our quantisation scheme is used, however, we nd that
single-photon wave packets propagate at the speed of light. In three-dimensions, despite
a much larger Hilbert space, light is also only characterised by an additional parameter
s=1. As demonstrated in Chapter 5, in three dimensions the localised solutions of
Maxwell's equations do not propagate in straight lines. The role of the parameter sin
this case is to specify the overall motion of the system, for example, the direction of a
plane wave.
Following closely the quantisation scheme of Bennett et al. [131], we were able to
derive a set of eld observables in terms of the orthogonal blip operators. In order to
ensure that the eld observables possessed the correct dimensions and transformation
properties, the electric and magnetic eld observables were related to the blip operators
by means of a non-local regularisation operator R. In this thesis, in contrast to many
other works, we dierentiate between the basic excitations of the EM eld, which are
completely localised, and the corresponding eld observables, which are spread out across
all of space (see Figs. 4.2.b and 7.3.a). In this sense our views are more in line with
those of Fleming [12] who states that locally orthogonal particle states also have some
fundamental meaning. By distinguishing between the particles and elds we were able
to demonstrate how the Casimir eect can be shown to arise entirely due to the non-
local characteristics of the eld observables. More specically, although the localised blip
excitations are unaected by the mirror when the two are not in contact, the non-local
elds are necessarily reected many times (see Fig. 7.3.d) causing a large amount of
interference inside the cavity. The eect of this interference on the zero-point energy
of the eld varies with the width of the cavity causing an attractive force between the
mirrors.
In both one and three dimensions our quantisation diers from standard approaches178
by introducing negative-frequency states. These states are often disregarded as they do
not usually possess a positive norm [200]; however, in this thesis we have found that
negative-frequency states are necessary for the construction of wave packets correspond-
ing to all possible solutions of Maxwell's equations. In quantum mechanics, the positive
energy observable and the dynamical Hamiltonian would usually be equal to each other.
When both positive and negative frequencies are taken into account, however, the dy-
namical Hamiltonian cannot be bounded below.
To avoid this problem we no longer insist that the positive energy observable and
the generator of time translations be the same. In this way we avoid the consequences
of Hegerfeldt's theorem [72] without the unnerving issue of having an energy observable
without a lower bound. Unlike the energy observable, the dynamical Hamiltonian takes
the form of an exchange operator. The role of this operator is to continually recreate loc-
alised blips at new positions at a rate equal to the energy expectation value of that state.
Without an energy observable to guide us, the exact form of the dynamical Hamiltonian
is determined from a constraint on the dynamics of the system. In free space, light
is restricted to the boundaries of the light-cones as illustrated in Fig. 1.3, but similar
constraints can be found for any other trajectory.
The quantisation schemes presented in Chapters 4 and 5 not only provide solutions to
existing problems; for example, in Chapter 6 we found a possible resolution to the Fermi
problem and in Ref. [110] we constructed locally-acting mirror Hamiltonians, but can
also be used, as we have seen in Chapter 7, to predict experimentally veriable results.
In spite of these successes, there are still important aspects of this quantisation that
we do not yet fully understand and that need to be examined further. For example,
in classical treatments, the momentum of a light pulse is given by its energy multiplied
by a unit vector oriented in the direction of propagation. Although the energy of a
blip is undetermined we appear to know something about its direction, and therefore
its momentum, whilst simultaneously having complete knowledge of its position. In our
case, when the position of a blip is known, there is complete uncertainty in the wave179
vector kand therefore complete uncertainty in the blip's dynamics. Nevertheless, we're
not yet sure if this can be related to the uncertainty of a measurable quantity and, if so,
what that quantity would be.
There is also the related question of, if our description of the quantised EM eld is
approached from the point of view of canonical quantisation, what would the canonical
variables be and how would their commutation relation be altered. This question has
been asked in Refs. [146, 168, 169] that look at a canonical quantisation approach to real
elds containing negative-frequency modes. In standard QED the canonical momentum
is given by the electric eld observable which commutes non-trivially with the vector
eldA(r;t) and therefore also B(r;t). In our scheme the electric and magnetic elds are
always related by a rotation and therefore commute. This is an important result that
would need to be investigated and lends itself to be measured via uncertainties.
Other questions which could be addressed experimentally are, for instance, can the
negative-frequency photons be measured in a laboratory? As both positive- and negative-
frequency waves are required to localise a wave packet to any length it is practically
impossible to separate the two, and so a clever experiment must be devised. The au-
thors of Ref. [165] claim to have already detected negative-frequency photons, but the
real relation between what we both call negative-frequency photons would need to be
examined more carefully before we can draw nal conclusions. One possibility for de-
tecting negative-frequency photons could be to construct a transformation between the
positive-frequency and negative-frequency modes, and then probe this transformation by
means of an interference experiment.
In standard quantum electrodynamics a conversion from the positive-frequency to
negative-frequency modes is imposed by a non-unitary Bogoliubov transformation between
the annihilation and creation operators of the original eld operators. This results in an
amplication eect such as the Unruh eect for uniformly accelerating observers. In
our case, however, it is possible that we would require an anti-unitary transformation
on the Hilbert space (similar to time reversal) that converts between the positive- and180
negative-frequency but positive-norm photon states. Materials with negative or tempor-
ally oscillating refractive indices have been studied, for example, by Pendry [201] and
others [202, 203, 204], which reverse the phase evolution of states, essentially invert-
ing their frequencies. These experiments create the possibility for realising the required
transformation in a laboratory.
In this thesis we have also supposed that interactions take place by means of a local
exchange of blips. As it is the eld observables that couple to charged matter and currents
(see Eqs. (2.4) and (2.7)), many other authors hold the view that interactions take place
by means of an exchange of eld excitations. An interesting extension to this work would
therefore be to couple blips to matter. This would not only increase the spectrum of
problems to which this theory could be applied, but also open an investigation into the
validity of the local blip approach to interactions by studying known eects. It would
also open the path to modelling experimental setups and photonic devices which have
not yet been accessible [195, 205]. This is a major motivation for the work presented
here.
Although there is still much to be understood and investigated, the work in this thesis
is beginning to open up new possibilities for studying complex or non-intuitive systems.
For example, this new formalism would also be very well suited to studying gravitational
systems in which the metric or curvature of space-time varies from place to place. The
Unruh eect is one eect that is usually discussed in terms of frequency modes, which
makes it dicult to visualise the underlying physical processes. A blip description of
this eect is very likely to produce a more lucid explanation [206]. Casimir cosmology
is also an interesting eld in gravitational physics [207, 208]. Regularisation procedures,
however, become increasingly dicult to manage in curved space-times. As our approach
has no need of regularisation procedures, this theory may oer a satisfying resolution to
this outstanding problem.
Our local theory of light also oers solutions to other long-standing problems. For
instance, the problem of time in quantum theory refers to the impossibility of dening181
a time operator [209, 210, 211]. The Pauli objection prohibits such an operator on the
basis that energy is bounded from below [212, 213, 214, 215] (and Refs. therein). As
discussed in Ref. [215], this theory evades this objection by dening a distinct dynamical
Hamiltonian, which is unbounded below, leading to the possibility of introducing time
observables or a quantum clock. This is perhaps not so surprising as our Dirac-like
equations of motion for the blips, Eqs. (4.12) and (5.55), closely resemble the Wheeler-
DeWitt equation of quantum gravity [216] which places a constraint on the dynamics of
a system.
In spite of remaining open questions, the results of this thesis and the way in which our
local theory appears to be so beautifully clearing the fog around many other problems
encourages me to believe that solutions will be found. By looking at electromagnetic
phenomena from the point of view of monochromatic photons we only see half the picture;
by introducing local photons we might in the future not only be able to gain unique
perspectives on a wide range of existing problems, but create all the necessary tools for
studying new ones.Bibliography

Derivation of 
(k)
Consider the pure boost that takes us from an initial reference frame Ointo a new
reference frameO0moving in a straight line at a speed vrelative to the original frame.
This transformation is imposed by the unitary operator U() where  deonotes the
transformation. If we dene a Cartesian coordinate system such that the reference frame
O0is moving in the positive xdirection with respect to the frame O, the electric and
magnetic elds will undergo a transformation that is given by, for example, Eq. (12.108)
of Ref. [125]. Under this transformation the orientation of the eld vectors transforms in
a way that ensures the new eld observables are divergence-less. One can check this using
the eld transformations in Ref. [125], the usual Lorentz transformations for the space
and time coordinates, and Maxwell's equations (2.8)-(2.11). The transformation also
preserves helicity. A detailed description of the transformation can be found in Section
5.9 of Ref. [127]. We shall ignore any transformation of the polarisation states here as it
is not relevant to determining the overall normalisation of the eld.
Under the Lorentz boost an initial wave vector kwill be transformed into the new
wave vector p. As we cannot boost into a frame in which light travels in the opposite
direction to its original trajectory, the parameter scan always be chosen such that it
remains constant under a boost. When we boost from the Oframe to theO0frame
the elds also undergo a Doppler-shift by a factor of jkj=jpj. By transforming the eld
196197
observables given in Eq. (5.46) under the unitary operation U(), one nds that
E0(r0) =Z

In the above we made use of the relation kr0=pr. The additional factor of jkj=jpjin
the last line is the blue-shift factor. By equating the last two lines of the above calculation
one nds that

(k)

(p)=s
jkj
jpj(A.2)
which is in agreement with Eq. (5.51). In one dimension the argument follows analogously
which leads us to Eq. (4.50).Appendix B
Divergence of the eld
expectation values
Consider again the regularised wave function given in Eq. (5.19). In the following we
shall dene a set of Cartesian coordinates xifori2f1;2;3g. Furthermore, the derivative
@ishall be used as shorthand for the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate xi.
The divergence of the regularised wave function is then given by
rZ
R3d3r0Rs(r r0) s(r0) =3X
i=1Z
R3d3r0@iRi
s(r r0) s(r0)

R3d3r0Ri
s(r r0)@0
i s(r0)
=Z
R3d3r0Rs(r r0)r0 s(r0): (B.1)
In the above, the third line follows from the second by integration by parts. We have
assumed in this step that our wave function vanishes at large distances. One nds,
therefore, that the regularised wave function is divergence-less only when the gradient
of the wave function is orthogonal to Rs. A similar calculation will show that the
198199
divergence of the vector eld
Rs[ s](r)s (B.2)
vanishes only when the gradient of the wave function is orthogonal to Rss. Using
the expressions for the eld expectation values in Eq. (5.18), one can see that Gauss's
laws for electric and magnetic elds are satised when the above conditions holds. This
proves our statement in Section 5.2.4.Appendix C
Derivation of Eq. (7.18)
This appendix derives Eq. (7.18) from Eq. (7.17) by making a series of substitutions.
Taking as our starting point the second line of Eq. (7.17), we rst make the substitution
x27! x2. The resulting expression is given by
HII
ZPE =~c
41X
n;m= 1ZD=2
 D=2dx1ZD=2
 D=2dx2
j(x1 x2+ (2n 1)D)(x1 x2+ (2m 1)D)j 3=2: (C.1)
In this next step we shall rst separate the x1integral into two halves. One of these
integrals shall run between  D=2 and 0, covering the negative values of x1, and the other
shall cover the remaining positive values between 0 and D=2. The resulting integral is
expressed
HII
ZPE =~c
41X
n;m= 1"Z0
 D=2dx1+ZD=2
0dx1#ZD=2
 D=2dx2
j(x1 x2+ (2n 1)D)(x1 x2+ (2m 1)D)j 3=2: (C.2)
We shall next make a separate substitution for each of these two integrals. For the
integral over negative values of x1we shall make the substitution x17!x1 D. For the
integral over the positive values of x1we shall make the substitution x17!x1+D. The
200201
rst integral then takes the form
HII
ZPE =~c
41X
n;m= 1ZD
D=2dx1ZD=2
 D=2dx2
j(x1 x2+ (2n 2)D)(x1 x2+ (2m 2)D)j 3=2: (C.3)
The second integral becomes
HII
ZPE =~c
41X
n;m= 1Z D=2
 Ddx1ZD=2
 D=2dx2
j(x1 x2+ 2nD)(x1 x2+ 2mD)j 3=2: (C.4)
As one nal step, we make the substitution n7!n+ 1 andm7!m+ 1 in Eq. (C.3).
This substitution does not change the limits of either sum. The integrands in both
Eqs. (C.3) and (C.4) are then equal both to each other and the integrand in the third
line of Eq. (7.17). Putting both lines of Eq. (7.17) together we have three integrals with
the same integrand: the third line of Eq. (7.17), Eq. (C.3) and Eq. (C.4). In each of these
three integrals the limits of x2are identical so can be factorised out of this sum. The
integrals over x1contribute to dierent sections of the real line. Eq. (C.4) integrates over
the region between  Dand D=2, the third line of Eq. (7.17) over the region between
 D=2 andD=2, and Eq. (C.3) over the region D=2 toD. Altogether the integral over
x1covers the region [  D;D ]. Eq. (7.17) is therefore equal to Eq. (7.18).
