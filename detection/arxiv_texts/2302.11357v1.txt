 Abstract  
 
Dominant modes of SST in the west and east Pacific show  strong but regionally different gradients  
caused by waves, internal dynamics , and anthropogenic warming , which drives  air-sea interaction in 
the Pacific . The study  discusses the relative contribution of  SST gradients over the western and eastern  
Pacific to the prediction skill of SST in the central Pacific , where El -Nino, La -Nina , or El -Nino Modoki 
events pr oject significantly. For this, t he analysis develops  a convolutional neural network (CNN) based 
prediction model to predict the Nino3.4 SST. CNN -based prediction models use a spatial filter at the 
initial stage , which is highly  efficient in capturing the edges  or gradients  and hence are useful to 
understand the role of SST spatial gradients in the prediction skill.  The study reports  three CNN -based  
model experiments . The first one is a CTRL experiment that uses the whole equato rial Pacific domain 
SST pattern. The second and third model s use the equatorial eastern and western Pacific domain SST  
only .  Another novel feature of this study is that we have generated a large number of ensemble 
members (5000) through  random initializat ion of CNN  filters .  It is found that random initialization 
affects the forecast skill , and the probability density function of the correlation skill of the 5000 models 
at each lead time  shows a gaussian distribution . 
The model experiments suggest that the  west Pacific SST model  provides better Nino3.4 skills  as 
compared to the east Pacific skill. The CNN -based  model forecast based on the SST pattern , thus , 
shows the impact of the SST spatial pattern on the ENSO forecast.

 1. Introduction  
The central pacific sea surface temperature ( SST) prediction is essential  from the 
perspective of El-Nino Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) prediction , especially the El-Nino Modoki 
events (Ashok et al., 2007) , CP-El-Nino (Yang and Jiang, 2014)  and understanding 
teleconnection s (e.g. ENSO -Monsoon  predictive teleconnection (Sahoo and Yadav, 2021 ) and 
several times dynamical models miss reliable  prediction of central pacific SST (Wen et al., 
2021) . Different flavors of ENSO , as well as El -Nino Modoki events , all project on the central 
Pacific SST  with different intensities . The spatial patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) 
over the equatorial central Pacific are controlled by local air-sea interaction ( i.e., SST-
convection feedback) (Zhang et al., 1995; Xiang et al., 2013) ,  ocean advection (Kug et al., 
2009) , wind -induced  thermocline variation (Ashok et al., 2007) , subtropical atmospheric  
forcing (Yu et al., 2010)  and the delayed effects of the wave propagation  (Suarez and Schopf, 
1988) . The current prediction skill of SST or ENSO is determined by the efficiency of models 
in representing these physical and dynamical  processes  in the western, eastern , and central 
Pacific Ocean . The thermocline is shallow , and SST is colder on the east Pacific . The SST is  
warmer , and the thermocline is deeper in the western Pacific.  Over the colder SST , the 
convective heating will be less effective , and hence , air-sea interaction is weaker, resulting in 
weak feedback to the atmospheric process contributing  to SST variability. This happens over 
the eastern Pacific for example (refer to Fig.1 of Suarez and  Schopf,  (1988)  for example). On 
the western side , the situation is different. The thermocline is much deeper , and again 
coupling is weaker li ke the eastern Pacific. However, westward propagating Rossby wave 
reflection occurs in the western boundary , and the reflected Kelvin wave propagates 
eastward. This is able to produce stronger temperature change (i.e. , dT/dt) in a delayed mode  
4 
 in the central Pacific and determines the local SST pattern. How does  the spatial distribution 
of equatorial SST in the eastern and western Pacific Oceans contribute  to the prediction skill 
of equatorial SST or ENSO?  It is well known that the ENSO or SST prediction skill has 
seasonality , and the spring barrier in predictability is well -studied  (Torrence and Webster, 
1998; Mukhin et al., 2021) .  
The i mportance of SST gradients in air -sea interaction and convection is well known (e.g. 
(Lindze n and Nigam, 1987) . Understanding the dependence of the prediction skill of central 
Pacific SST or ENSO on the spatial temperature pattern of the equatorial Pacific is , thus,  
important (Liang et al., 2021) . Central Pacific El -Nino and El -Nino Modoki have shown an  
increasing trend in recent years  (Ashok et al., 2007 ).  As discussed earlier , the SST evolution 
pattern  over the eastern and the western pacific are dominated by different processes , and 
the depth of thermocline differs largely over the eastern and western Pacific, we undertake 
the current study to show the relative prediction skill  of central Pacific SST as well as ENSO  by 
using the SST  pattern over the western and eastern Pacific . How does  the spatial temperature 
pattern (or SST gradient) over  the Pacific can impact the prediction skill? It can be answered 
in two ways: first, the dispersion relation connects the spatial structure of a mode with its 
temporal frequency. Rossby mode has a distinct spatial structure which is related to its 
periodicity , and hence , temporal evolution tendencies of this mode are linked to the spatia l 
pattern that impacts the prediction skill. Second , the advection term in the temperature 
equation is related to the spatial  gradient of a field, which leads to contributing to the 
calculation of temperature tendencies  (e.g. equation 1 of (Ballester et al., 2016) . The 
advective terms in the ocean determine low -frequency oscillations of general ocean -
atmosphere interaction (Saravanan and McWilliams, 1998)  and the ENSO advective oscillators 
(Picaut et al., 1997) . The dynamical models can be used to understand the budget terms , and  
5 
 contribution of different physical terms can be calculated  (Wen et al., 2021) . However, the 
SST variation in dynamical models depends on a large number of physical processes , and the 
sensitivity in predicting SST anomalies are dependent on multiple phys ical factors. Often 
isolation of simpler factors requires well -designed experiments.  Even the simplest oscillator 
models (Zebiak and Cane, 1987)  recognize the importance of SST variation in the eastern and 
western Pacific  but do not consider spatial gradients . For example, the w est pacific oscillator  
(Weisberg and Wang, 1997) , central and east Pacific oscillators  (Zebiak and Cane, 1987)  are 
somewh at different  in conceptual formulation  those describe the SST variations in the 
western and eastern side of the basin .  
Thus,  the above studies suggest an important role of spatial SST patterns  in the context of 
understanding the ENSO. However,  asymmetries  in the processes that contribute to ENSO 
dynamics are well known , and the recent studies based on AI -based method s clearly brought 
out such features (Shin et al., 2022) . In the context of  the predict ion of central Pacific SST, the 
role of west pacific versus east Pacific surface temperature patterns are not clear.  More 
specifically , how the advective gradients , or the wave patterns that form the SST structure in 
the east and west Pacific, contribut e to the prediction skill is still not  clear.  Global warming 
or other factors affect surface temperature s. West and East Pacific warming trend is different 
owing to different physical factors  (Park et al., 2022) , and hence warming trend would impose 
different gradient of tem poral evolution  on these sectors.  Hence , an estimat ion of the 
sensitivity of surface temperature pattern s on the prediction skill is important.   
Deep Machine learning models are increasingly used in prediction problem s, and they are 
now used in the  ENSO pr ediction problem  which suggest skill varying from  6 months to 18 
months  (Mu et al., 2021; Ham et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020) . Deep learning models are very  
6 
 efficient in isolating spatial gradients , and the training does not suffer from vanishing g radient 
problem s as compared to normal fully connected networks. Different variants of 
convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning models are popular in the ENSO 
prediction.  In the context of understanding the role of west Pacific and east Pacif ic pattern in 
predicting the central Pacific SST  (or El -Nino Modoki and CP -El-Nino) , the CNN based model 
can be used. The CNN models have spatial filters and pooling layers t hat identify the  dominant 
spatial gradients  in the data. Thus, the spatial sample is denoised keeping the most important 
information. A prediction scheme using the CNN thus can be suitable for understanding the 
role of SST spatial patterns in predicting the ENSO.  
The current analysis will frame a simple (i.e., “vanilla”) CNN based prediction model of 
central Pacific SST . Unlike other models those try to extend the prediction skill of ENSO indices 
to longer duration  by combining several steps , this vanilla  CNN model  is used here to 
understand the ro le of SST spatial pattern in the west and east Pacific to predict the central 
pacific SST and hence CP -ElNino or E lNino Modoki .  Such simple models are based on basic 
recommended  AI model version and  are conveniently used to understand dynamics  of ENSO 
events  (Shin et al., 2022) . The prediction model is formulated based on traditional CNN based 
method and use s one variable only (i.e. , SST). The prediction experiment attempts to predict 
NINO3.4 SST  anomaly , which is considered as an important central Pacific indicator of ENSO. 
The sc hematic of a CNN is shown in Fig.1.  Additionally,  in the current analysis, we will 
generate a multi -ensemble prediction models using a CNN formulation , to construct a 
probabilistic ensemble of CNN based prediction model s and we show the relative role of west 
and east Pacific SST in the prediction of NINO3.4 SST at different lead time s. 
2. Method  and Data   
7 
 (a) CNN based prediction scheme   
The CNN model used here is developed by using SST over the Pacific domain as the predictor. 
The method closely follows Ham et al (2019)  except the domain is different and the input 
matrix also uses  SST lags up to 12 month as different channels .  The reason for selection of a 
lag of twelve months is as follows:  we first conducted a simple forecas t using multiple linear 
regression using NINO3.4 as predictor and predict the same index at different lead -times. We 
appended multiple lags to generate maximum skillful prediction of NINO3.4 at lag 1 and then 
the correlation skill decreases as lead increas es (Fig.7  black curve, also discussed latter) . This 
is taken as a benchmark for the CNN forecast CTRL experiment ( discussed in next  section ). 
The same lag is then used for CNN prediction with the hypothesis that at higher lags the CNN 
should at least provide better skill. For the CNN model also, t he predictand is the area 
averaged SST anomaly over the NINO3.4 region (area -averaged SST anomaly o ver 170° –
120°  W, 5°  S–5° N) up to 12 months lead -time.   
(b) Prediction Experiments  
To understand the relative role of the SST over west and East Pacific , three  experiments are 
designed.  The first experiment uses SST distribution over the whole  equatorial  Pacific (120 ° 
E-90° W,15° S-15° N) which is used as a standard reference of CONTROL  experiment in which 
the convolution operation is performed over the whole Pacific domain  and the convolution 
filters are applied for the whole domain.  The domain selected sh ows strong gradients in trend 
and SST pattern can be obtained  from empirical orthogonal function analysis of  SST. The 
dominant  trend mode and the second  dominant mode shows strong gradients  (plot for trend 
and EOF patterns are not shown , refer  Barbosa and Anderson (2009)  or  L’Heareux et al., 
(2013)  for detailed analysis . Also,  since the full Pacific domain is selected , this model is  
8 
 supposed to have maximum  information for the convolution operation . This is referred as the 
CTRL  forecast through out this paper. In the second  experiment CNN model is created based 
on the east ern Pacific (160° W-90° W,15° S-15° N) SST anomaly  and is referred to as the EAST 
experiment.  This model has only east  Pacific SST gradient information. The third  experiment 
takes only west  pacific domain (120 ° E-160° W,15° S-15° N) and is referred as WEST  
experiments.  This model has only west  Pacific SST gradient information.  
We have created 5000 ensemble experiments for each of the three types  of runs  with skin 
temperature  data and 1000 -member  ensemble for ERSST and COBE SST runs . The last two 
analysis datasets  are primarily used for verification (discussed in next section) . The ensemble 
forecast is created to understand the sensitivity of the stochastic  randomization of the filter 
weights. Ensembles are generated in such a wa y that different  filter  weig hts are generated 
and stored after the model fit . Each of the ensemble member  models are stored separately.  
It is found that such weight  randomization affects  the predictability skill in the CNN models. 
This is analogous to the sensitivity of dynamical model runs to slight variations in initial 
conditions (i.e. , effect of chaos and non -linearity ) or effect of displacement error while 
computations causing foreca st drifts (Orrell et al., 2001 ). Model is trained from 19 50-2001  
(612 months) and test period is 2002 -2021 (228 months ).  
The block diagram of the three experiments are shown in Fig.1.  As already mentioned, the 
SST conditions for the past 12 months have  been used to predict the N INO3.4 SST anomaly 
conditions for a lead time of 12 months. The basic components for all the three models remain 
the same with the input domain size varying for different experiments. The model consists of 
two convolutional layers, two pooling layers, a Flatten layer and a Dense layer.  The input is 
filtered using the convolution layer with 64 filters each having a ker nel size of 3 X 3. The output  
9 
 from the first convolution layer undergoes a spatial pooling by using a 2 X 2 max -pooling layer 
with a stride of 2. This filtered data is again passed through a convolution layer having 128 
filters with a kernel size of 3 X 3 and a max -pooling layer same as the above. This is flattened 
using a Flatten layer and the output is obtained by passing through a Dense layer of size 12. 
Both the convolution layers use hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) as the activation function 
and the  Dense layer uses a linear activation function. The initial weights for the Convolution 
layers are created  using the Glorot Uniform (also known as Xavier Uniform) initializer  with the 
seed taken as 10 and the biases are initialized with zeros . A summary of the set of 
hyperparameters used for the model runs are shown in Table 1 .  The models are run using 
the tensorflow  keras python module in the computing resources provided by the Google 
Colaboratory which includes the NVIDIA -System Management In terface (SMI) driver version 
of 460.32.03 .  
(c) Data  
The CNN network requires data without undefined value . To fulfill the objective of the analysis 
we will use surface temperature  data. There are several sea -surface temperature reanalysis 
data are available. However, sea surface temperature (SST) data generally contains undefined 
value over land and small islands. These undefined values are not desired in the convolutional 
network routines. Hence, we will use skin temperature as our primary data and sea -surface 
temperature data (ERSST  V5(Huang et al., 2017 ) and COBE  SST (Hirahara et al., 2013 ) with 
temperature filled over land as secondary verification data for our conclusion.  The monthly 
SST data is obtained from the daily skin temperature data from NCEP Reanal ysis 1 dataset for 
a period from 1950 -2021  (Kalnay et al., 1996)  over the tropical Pacific domain ( 120° E-90° 
W,15° S-15° N). The skin temperature data represents the SST over oceans and the land  
10 
 surface temperature over the continents. This data is highly correlated (> 0.85) with ERSST 
analysis and COBE SST analysis over equatorial pacific (plot not shown). The monthly skin 
temperature data is calculated from the daily data and the anomaly is deri ved by removing 
the climatological average during 1950 -2021. The SST anomaly for the N INO3.4 region which 
is the predictand , is obtained by taking the arithmetic average of the skin temperature 
anomaly over the N INO3.4 region ( 170° –120°  W, 5°  S–5° N). The spatial skin temperature 
anomaly data (hereafter mentioned as SST) for the past 12 months are used as the predictor 
to predict the N INO3.4 SST anomaly for a lead time of 12 months.  
3. Results  
The current analysis is based on the assumed relation of the east and west Pacific with central 
Pacific . To have a first order understanding of the same relationship, we  plot the monthly lag-
correlation of SST averaged over a small  reference  box ( 170°W - 140° W, 5°S-5°N) in the 
central Pacific with the entire equatorial pacific  between 15 °S-15°N. The lag -correlation is 
shown in Fig.2 . The correlation analysis shows that there is a systematic shift of higher 
correlation pattern from lag -12 to lag -1 indicating  that at higher lags west Pacific is correlated 
to the box. As lag decreases, east Pacific gets higher correlation. Thus, it indicates the shift in 
the spatial correlation pattern with respect to lags. This systematic shift in the spatial pattern 
of correl ation for central Pacific SST  indicates that to develop a model for SST prediction in 
the central Pacific, both east and west Pacific  Oceans  are important. To understand the 
relative importance of the west and east Pacific SST patterns we perform the exper iments as 
described in sec.2. The west and east Pacific domains chosen for experiments are shown in 
Fig.1 (top) .   
11 
 a. CTRL experiment : The CTRL experiment spans the whole equatorial Pacific domain 
(refer sec.2b). The Fig.3a (left panel ) shows the training and test loss for this 
experiment  with the shaded portion showing the spread among ensembles . Model 
shows  a realistic stabilization in the training and test mode.  The skill of the 5000 -
member  ensemble up to 12 months lead -time is shown  in Fig.4.  The correlation  
coefficient /standardized RMSE  (normalized by predictand standard deviation during 
the test period)  is plotted  along the x -axis, while the  percentage  distribution  of 
ensemble is plotted along the y -axis. Each subpanel represents a lead -time with skills 
plotted up to 12 months lead -time. Correlation stays in the range  0.5-0.6 and 
normalized  (standardized) RMSE also stays below 1 for all members up to 6 months 
lead -time.  The mean absolute error ( MAE) , which is used as the loss function  to 
configure the model is also shown in the figure. MAE  shows increase  similar to  RMSE 
but it is starting from some lower value  from lead -1 to lead -8. Also,  the spread of error 
distrib ution increase with lead time. Thus, the model gives good fidelity in NINO3.4 
forecast up to 6 months. It may be noted that as the lead increases correlation spread 
among members increases while the RMSE spread decreases.  This correlation skill is 
comparable to dynamical model skill  (Barnston et al., 2011, 2012) . The skill, however 
is modest as compared to the current generation of advanced CNN model  with 
multiple predictors  or bigger domains e.g. (Mu et al., 2021; Ham et al., 2019) . 
However, the purpose of the experiment is to see the sensitivity of west Pacific versus 
East Pacific SST pattern in determining the skill. Hence , we will use this as a ba seline 
skill.  
b. EAST  experiment : For the EAST experiment the skill is shown in Fig.5 in a similar 
manner as that of Fig.4. The training and test loss are shown in middle panel of Fig.3b.  
12 
 For the east pacific experiment, the skill quickly falls below 0.5 at 5  months lead time  
and a lso, the RMSE increases  at a faster rate with respect to lead -time .  The spread 
(i.e. half width) of the distribution is larger than the CTRL experiment.  MAE plot also 
shows similar result as RMSE plot.  
c. WEST experiment :  The plot for WEST experiments are shown in a similar manner in 
Fig. 6 and the training and test loss are shown in right panel of Fig.3c. As it can be seen 
that in comparison with EAST experiment the WEST experiment shows much better 
skill and the skill is  comparable to the CTRL  prediction . Also,  the spread is comparable 
to the CTRL (i.e. full domain) . The MAE distribution plot also shows lesser spread than 
the EAST experiment.  
The above results are summarized in terms of ensemble mean skill in Fig.7. The results suggest 
that the West Pacific experiment shows better results in term of correlation and RMSE.  At the 
shorter lead -time (2 -5 months) West Pacific provides higher ski ll. Fig.7  also shows the 
prediction skill of NINO3.4 based on a regression -based  prediction model developed using 
NINO3.4 SST up to 12 lags as predictors  (a multilinear regression using lags as different 
variables  for the same training period ). This is the benchmark model to verify the CTRL run. 
As it can be seen that though at lower lea d (lead -time 1 or 2) the skill  of CTRL CNN model and 
the benchmark model  is comparable, at the higher lead -time the CNN based model give 
better skill (lead -time 6 above), confirming the usefulness of CNN based machine learning 
forecasting.  The power spect ra of forecasted SST and observed SST at higher lead -time shows 
that the power is weaker in the forecast at higher lead -time (not shown). This indicates that 
forecasted variance is biased, which is a common problem in forecast which require variance 
correc tion ( which we have not attempted here though , as our aim is to compare the 
sensitivity  of skill with east/west domain ). The temporal evolution of the observed NINO3.4  
13 
 SST anomaly  versus predicted  anomaly (without any bias correction)  for all the experiments 
as different lead time forecasts during the test period is shown in Fig.8. It is clear from the 
plot that the models have difficulty in capturing the 2015 -2016 event extreme peak as the 
lead -time increases. Also,  for higher lead -time some phase shift can be noticed (e.g. lead 5 
for the year 2011).  To understand the skill during peak EL -Nino or La -Nina, the model forecasts  
for the four peak El -Nino and La -Nina events  are shown in Fig. 9 and Fig.10 respectively. The 
results show that at higher lead -time the skill of the forecasts from WEST runs are better on 
many occasions.  
4. Comparison with other Reanalysis Data  
In order to understand the fidelity of the results based on skin temperature data, we hav e 
compared the results with runs from two separate analysis data  (ERSST and COBE SST 
analysis). The ERSST and COBE SST is used to create a 1000 -member ensemble. The 
comparison is made for 1000 -member ensembles of all the three datasets. The results of 
pred iction are shown in Fig.11 . From Fig.11b  and 11c it is clear that like the skin temperature 
(Fig. 11a), the WEST runs have better correlation than EAST  runs . Also,  the CTRL shows better 
correlation at six  months lead time  for NCEP skin temperature and reanalysis but not in ERSST 
where the correlation is not significant.  Thus, in general the results indicate that EAST and 
WEST basin shows different skills at different lead -times.  
5. Discussion and Conclusion  
The above analysis is carried out to compare the NINO3.4 forecast skill based on WEST and 
EAST runs and compare with a whole domain (CTRL) run.  The primary  experiments are 
conducted using the  NCEP skin temperature and not with ERSST or COBE  SST analysis as the  
14 
 SST has undefine d data over islands in the domain .  Analysis SST data is used as additional 
source of verification in which the SST over the island is replaced by NCEP skin temperature . 
The objective behind this comparison is to see the relative role of western Pacific and eastern 
Pacific surface temperature pattern in the prediction skill of the NIN O3.4 SST which is a 
representative  index for different ENSO flavors including E lNino  Modoki patterns  (e.g. Table -
2 of (Ashok et al., 2007) . The SST patterns are reflected as the horizontal spatial gradients 
which are re sultant of trends, physical processes, advective properties or wave modes.  Such 
SST gradients are well known to impact the local convection and surface winds (Lindzen and 
Nigam, 1987)  . Hence the pattern of SST gradients can impact the prediction skill. The current 
study employs an efficient deep machine learning based gradient detection method ( CNN) to 
predict the SST  index (NINO3.4) in the central Pacific . The CNN use the convolution operations 
and the convolution filter identifies the gradients (of SST  in the current study) in the spatial 
domains. The results clearly indicate that West Pacific SST pattern plays a dominant role in 
determining the forecast skill of N INO3.4 SST.  The skill is highest for the whole domain (i.e. , 
CTRL)  run when the model has full information of the equatorial SST pattern in the Pacific.  
But the skill is modest when only  central to eastern Pacific patterns are considered. The 
asymmetric  impact  (i.e. WEST has more skill than EAST)  reflects  complexity of ENSO dynamics 
in the Pacific , as discussed in other literatures which use machine learning to understand the 
role of ENSO dynamics. The prediction skill is comparable to the dynamical model forecast for 
the CTRL runs  Barnston et al., 2011, 2 012) , thus indicating that the surface SST in the western 
equatorial Pacific plays a major role in the predictability of NINO3 .4 pattern. Western and 
eastern Pacific have asymmetric trend in terms of warming, and physical process es that 
govern the surface as well as subsurface SST distribution is different. Also,  central pacific SST 
is impacted by the Rossby waves and the reflected Kelvin waves from the western Pacific  
15 
 boundary, and the thermocline is deeper in the west. All these  factors determine the surface 
SST pattern.  We show here that the surface SST pattern of western side and eastern side 
plays a different role in the CNN models which employ the spatial filters to generate the 
prediction model at the initial layers.  
 Another important conclusion from the study is that , the initialization of spatial filters in the 
CNN layers matter in determining the prediction skill. Even a small difference weight  of the 
filters  (due to randomization at the model fit la yer) can produce large difference in skill am ong 
the ensemble members at larger lead -time.  Thus,  it is important to take care of the 
randomization of the filters in understanding the  prediction skills.  It is probably best to create 
a large number of ensemble and the ensemble distribution would be giv en to fully understand 
the forecast efficiency of a machine learning model.  
The difference in skill related to WEST and EAST runs can be attributed to the fact that the 
ENSO phases and their reversal are related to the delayed Oscillator response of Rossby  wave 
in the western Pacific, which changes the phases of the ENSO after Rossby reflection in the 
western boundary as Kelvin waves. The reflection of Kelvin waves in the eastern Pacific as 
coastal Kelvin wave across the  eastern coast , probably does not help in the ENSO oscillatory 
cycle as much as in the WEST runs.  For the peak ENSO cases (ElNino or LaNina) considered 
here, the WEST run shows moderately better SST values than EAST runs. Skill for some 
individual El -Nino or La -Nina cases are comparable in the EAST, WEST or CTRL runs indicating 
that the peak ENSO forecast skill may or may not depend on SST of the western and eastern 
Pacific  oceans . Subsurface information is not included here and it s role on ENSO prediction  
skill would be seen in a later study.
