The statistical evolution of ensembles of random, weakly-interacting waves is governed by wave
kinetic equations. To simplify the analysis, one frequently works with reduced differential mod-
els of the wave kinetics. However, the conditions for deriving such reduced models are seldom
justified self-consistently. Here, we derive a reduced model for the wave kinetics of the Schr¨ odinger-
Helmholtz equations in two spatial dimensions, which constitute a model for the dynamics of light
in a spatially-nonlocal, nonlinear optical medium. This model has the property of sharply localising
the frequencies of the interacting waves into two pairs, allowing for a rigorous and self-consistent
derivation of what we term the semilocal approximation model (SLAM) of the wave kinetic equation.
Using the SLAM, we study the stationary spectra of Schr¨ odinger-Helmholtz wave turbulence, and
characterise the spectra that carry energy downscale, and waveaction upscale, in a forced-dissipated
setup. The latter involves a nonlocal transfer of waveaction, in which waves at the forcing scale
mediate the interactions of waves at every larger scale. This is in contrast to the energy cascade,
which involves local scale-by-scale interactions, familiar from other wave turbulent systems and from
classical hydrodynamical turbulence.
I. INTRODUCTION
Wave turbulence is the statistical theory of large ensembles of random, weakly nonlinear, dispersive waves [1, 2].
Accordingly, when developing the wave turbulence description of a physical system, one is most frequently concerned
with the mean square of the wave intensity: the waveaction spectrum. The equation of motion for the spectrum is
known as the wave kinetic equation (WKE), and describes the irreversible evolution of the spectrum over nonlinear
timescales (which are long compared to the linear wave period), due to resonant M-wave interactions. For a system
indspatial dimensions, the WKE involves an integration over R(M−1)d, constrained to the resonant manifold of
interacting waves. The complexity of this so-called collision integral makes solving the WKE a challenging task in
general. Nonetheless, certain analytic techniques exist, in particular the Zakharov-Kraichnan transform that allows
one to find the Kolmogorov-Zakharov (KZ) cascade spectra [3]. These are stationary solutions of the WKE on which,
for many systems, the dynamical invariants cascade with constant flux through spatial scales, via a self-similar,
spectrally local (scale-by-scale) transfer, analogous to the Kolmogorov energy spectrum in classical hydrodynamics.
The stationary spectrum of thermodynamic equilibrium—the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) spectrum—can also be derived
trivially as the spectrum on which the collision integral has an integrand that vanishes pointwise.
In a seminal paper, Dyachenko et. al. [4] demonstrated that the collision integral can be greatly simplified if one
makes the ad-hoc assumption that the wave interaction coefficient is sharply peaked, so that all Mwaves taking part
in interactions have approximately the same frequency. This assumption, which we will refer to as superlocality, allows
one to reduce the collision integral to a differential operator. The resulting equation—the differential approximation
model (DAM)—preserves a great deal of the structure of the original WKE, namely its conserved quantities, the degree
of nonlinearity with respect to the spectrum, its scaling with frequency, and, as a result of the latter, the stationary
RJ and KZ solutions. DAMs are the wave turbulence equivalent of the Leith model of classical hydrodynamics [5, 6].
Being differential equations, DAMs are much easier to work with than the collision integrals from which they are
derived. They have been used in a wide variety of physical systems to examine topics such as the stationary RJ
and KZ wave turbulence spectra [4, 7–12], thermalisation at the end of a cascade spectrum [13], the crossover from
strong to weak turbulence [14], and the nature of transient spectra before the KZ spectra are established, including
the anomalous scaling of spectral fronts [15–18].
The reduction of a WKE to a DAM is predicated on the assumption of superlocality. However, this assumption
is rarely justified in the cases where DAMs are applied, indeed Dyachenko et. al. [4] introduced the DAM in the
context of the cubic nonlinear Schr¨ odinger equation, whose interaction coefficient is a constant across Fourier space.
Furthermore, DAMs are often constructed heuristically, based on the scaling properties of the interaction coefficient,

with the desired stationary solutions and degree of nonlinearity built in. To our knowledge, there has been no rigorous
derivation of the DAM for any system whose interaction coefficient has the required properties to justify any locality
assumption.
In this paper, we derive such a reduced model for the wave kinetics of the Schr¨ odinger-Helmholtz equations (SHE).
We introduce the SHE in Sec. II, along with their physical context, the dynamical invariants that they conserve
(namely energy and waveaction), their WKE, and the directions in Fourier space that their invariants flow during
the wave kinetic evolution. The SHE are of interest to us because they comprise the first system studied in the
wave turbulence context in which the spectral locality of interactions arises naturally from the functional form of
the interaction coefficient. In fact, the locality manifested by the SHE is one in which distinct pairs of interacting
waves are localised in frequency space. We refer to the latter as a semilocal, as opposed to a superlocal, limit. We
exploit this property in Sec. III to reduce the kinetic equation of the SHE to a simpler model, in the same spirit as
the derivation of the DAM in Ref. [4]. It transpires that the semilocality property allows the collision integral to be
reduced to an integro-differential operator, rather than a purely differential one. The resulting reduction of the WKE
we term the semilocal approximation model (SLAM).
Analysis of the SLAM allows us to extract the stationary spectra of the WKE, including prospective candidates for
the KZ cascade spectra, in Sec. IV. However, we demonstrate that the KZ waveaction cascade spectrum is pathological,
as it leads to a divergence of the SLAM at high frequency. Furthermore, in Sec. V we show how the KZ spectra lead to
flux directions that are inconsistent with the more general argument we present in Sec. II C 2, requiring us to reconsider
the spectra that establish the turbulent transport of dynamical invariants across scales of the system. We proceed
to find the true waveaction flux spectrum in Sec. VI, and conclude that both stationary solutions that describe the
flux of energy on the one hand, and waveaction on the other, are very closely related to the RJ equilibrium spectrum.
The waveaction flux spectrum, which carries waveaction to large scales, is dominated by nonlocal interactions, with
waves at the forcing scale mediating wave interactions at all larger scales. By contrast, the energy flux spectrum,
which carries energy to small scales, has local scale-by-scale interactions. We start by introducing the SHE in the
next section.
II. SCHR ¨ODINGER-HELMHOLTZ EQUATION
The SHE consist of a nonlinear Schr¨ odinger equation for the dynamical variable ψ(x, t)∈C,
i∂ψ
∂t+∇2ψ−V(ψ)ψ= 0, (1a)
coupled, via the potential V(ψ)∈R, to the Helmholtz equation,
∇2V−ΛV=α|ψ|2. (1b)
We take the spatial domain to be a d-dimensional periodic box of side length L. The SHE (1) are a spatially nonlocal1
version of the familiar cubic nonlinear Schr¨ odinger equation (NLSE, also known as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation),
i∂ψ
∂t+∇2ψ± |ψ|2ψ= 0. (2)
The NLSE is obtained from Eqs. (1) by sending α,Λ→ ∞ in such a way that α/Λ remains constant, and renormalising
ψ.
The physical applications of the SHE were discussed in Ref. [12]; in brief, for d= 3 they describe so-called Fuzzy
Dark Matter [19–21] in a universe with cosmological constant Λ. In d= 2, Eqs. (1) describe the perpendicular
dynamics of laser light in a thermo-optic or elasto-optic nonlinear medium [22–24]. In the optics case, Λ is the
normalised Kerr coefficient of spatially-local interactions. The dynamical variable ψ(x, t) represents, respectively, the
wavefunction of the putative dark matter boson, or the envelope of the electric field. Here we restrict ourselves to the
d= 2 case.
Also closely associated with the SHE are the Schr¨ odinger-Newton equations (SNE) [25–27],
i∂ψ
∂t+∇2ψ−V(ψ)ψ= 0, (3a)
∇2V=α|ψ|2, (3b)
1The spatial nonlocality originates from the inversion of the Helmholtz operator in Eq. (1b). The term “local” is used here in a different
sense to the locality of interactions in frequency space, to which the semilocal approximation refers.3
which are obtained by formally setting Λ = 0 in the SHE. However, as discussed in Ref. [12], the SNE are ill-
posed in periodic settings, or when one wants to describe fluctuations over an infinite, static background, because
that background does not solve the Poisson equation (3b), c.f. the “Jeans swindle” [28]. Non-trivial dynamics are
recovered by introducing a spatially local term to the left-hand side of Eq. (3b), i.e. moving to the SHE [29]. This
fact is reflected in the divergence of the SLAM when we set Λ = 0, see Sec. VII A.
A. Hamiltonian and invariants of the SHE
Most commonly in wave turbulence, the equation of motion under study can be derived via Hamilton’s equation
i∂tψ=δH/δψ∗. Equations (1) are no exception, with the Hamiltonian functional being
H=Z
|∇ψ|2dx+Zα
2h
(∇2−Λ)−1/2|ψ|2i2
dx. (4)
The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (4) is the quadratic energy, associated with the free propagation of
dispersive waves. The second term is the energy contribution due to the nonlinear interaction of waves via the
spatially-nonlocal potential V(ψ) =α(∇2−Λ)−1|ψ|2that solves Eq. (1b). The operator ( ∇2−Λ)−qwith qrational
and positive, is to be understood as a formal power series, and is made concrete in its Fourier-space representation
(the latter is found in Ref. [12]).
In the absence of forcing and dissipation (see below), the Hamiltonian His conserved under the evolution via the
SHE, and is strictly positive. The other positive invariant is the waveaction (a.k.a. number of particles, in reference
to the application to Bosonic systems),
N=Z
|ψ|2dx. (5)
The momentum P= (i/2)R
(ψ∇ψ∗−ψ∗∇ψ)dxis yet another conserved quantity. However, not being sign-definite,
it plays no role in the argument regarding the invariant cascade directions, see Sec. II C 2. The momentum will not
feature in the work we carry out in this paper.
B. SHE in Fourier space
In Fourier space Eqs. (1) become an equation of motion for ψk(t) = (1 /L)dR
ψ(x, t) exp(−ik·x)dx, the Fourier
series coefficient of ψ(x, t) for the wave mode with wavevector k:

is the interaction coefficient for the SHE. It gives the strength of nonlinear interactions between tetrads of waves that
satisfy k1+k2−k3−k= 0, to which the sum in Eq. (6) is constrained via the Kronecker delta δ12

1. Freely-evolving vs. forced-dissipated systems
In a closed system, namely one with no sources or sinks of dynamical invariants, Eq. (6) (equivalently Eq. (1))
describes the conservative dynamics of the field ψk(t) (equivalently ψ(x, t)) evolving freely from an initial condition.
Alternatively, one can consider a system in which invariants are injected into the system by some forcing mechanism,4
and removed from it by dissipation. These mechanisms manifest as extra terms FkandDk, respectively, on the
right-hand side of Eq. (6) (and their Fourier inverses on the right-hand side of Eq. (1a)). Analogous terms appear on
the right-hand side of the WKE (8) in the forced-dissipated case.
In turbulence theory, one usually considers forcing to be isotropic (depending only on k:=|k|), statistically time-
independent, and to act in a narrow band of lengthscales around a characteristic wavenumber kf.Fkis then a
stochastic term supported within the forcing range and negligible elsewhere. Dissipation is usually significant at the
largest and/or smallest lengthscales of the system, and negligible elsewhere. In this paper, we assume both large-scale
and small-scale isotropic dissipation, with respective characteristic wavenumbers kd−andkd+.
Furthermore, we take the forcing and dissipation scales to be widely separated: kd−≪kf≪kd+. Lengthscales in
between, but far from, the forcing and dissipation scales are known as the inertial ranges. Inside the inertial ranges
the dynamics are conservative, described by Eq. (6) (equivalently (1a), and when we consider wave turbulence, the
WKE (8)) with zero right-hand side. The role of forcing and dissipation is to provide a source and sink of invariants
on either side of the inertial ranges, setting up a flux of invariants through them. We discuss the directions of these
fluxes in section II C 2.
C. Wave kinetic equation
Wave turbulence is primararily concerned with the waveaction spectrum nk(t) = (L/2π)d⟨|ψk(t)|2⟩. The operator
⟨·⟩denotes an average over a statistical ensemble of realisations, starting from independent initial conditions ψk(0),
with phases uniformly distributed in [0 ,2π), and identically distributed amplitudes. Taking the domain size L→ ∞ ,
and then assuming weak nonlinearity, one can derive the following WKE describing the evolution of the spectrum at
intermediate times due to the nonlinear 4-wave interactions of the 2 ↔2 type [2]:

3k)n1n2n3nk1
nk+1
n3−1
n1−1
n2
dk1dk2dk3. (8)
The right-hand side of Eq. (8) is the collision integral, and is taken across the joint k-space R2×R2×R2. Here,
δ12
3k:=δ(k1+k2−k3−k) and δ(ω12
3k) are Dirac delta functions that constrain interacting wave tetrads to the resonant
manifold defined by
k1+k2−k3−k= 0, (9a)
ω12
3k:=ω1+ω2−ω3−ωk= 0. (9b)
Here ωk=k2is the linear dispersion relation. We have also used the shorthand notation ni=nki, ωi=ωkietc. for
i= 1,2,3.
Inspecting Eq. (7), we see manifestly that the interaction coefficient W12
3kdecays rapidly when all wavevectors are
very different. The first term in W12
3kbecomes dominant when k1→k. By Eq. (9a) we then have k2→k3. If we also
have Λ ≪k2, then the interaction coefficient becomes sharply peaked in the joint k-space where k1≈kandk3≈k2,
with the latter following from the above symmetries. Likewise, if the second term in W12
3kis dominant then it becomes
peaked over k1≈k3andk2≈k. These pairings are equivalent to the first pairings by exchange of dummy variables,
asW12
3kalways appears under a sum or integral.
Thus, the 4-wave interactions responsible for evolution of the system under the SHE (1), and therefore the corre-
sponding WKE (8), are dominated by interactions in which k1≈kandk3≈k2. This property of the interaction
coefficient, of picking out dominant interactions when pairs of wavevectors become equal, we refer to as semilocality. It
is this property that will allow the collision integral to be reduced to a simpler operator. We will retain the possibility
thatk1̸≈k2, so the reduction will be to an integro-differential, rather than a purely differential, operator.
At this point we note that taking the NLSE limit α,Λ→ ∞ with α/Λ→const. sends W12
3k→ ±1. In this case
there is no natural pairing of ( k1,k) and ( k2,k), and we lose the semilocality property. We return to this point in
Sec. VII A.
1. Invariants of the wave kinetic equation
In general, WKEs of the M/2↔M/2 type ( Mbeing an even integer denoting the order of the resonant wave
interaction), such as Eq. (8), conserve the two quadratic invariants
E=Z
ωknkdkand N=Z
nkdk. (10)5
Comparing with Eq. (5) we see that Nis the total waveaction, expressed in Eq. (10) as an integral over Fourier
space. Both the original SHE and the WKE derived from them conserve the waveaction exactly. By contrast, Eis
the Fourier-space representation of the quadratic energy (first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (4)). Recall that the
WKE is derived under the assumption of weak nonlinearity. Under this condition, Ewill be the leading contribution
to the total Hamiltonian H, i.e. the original equations of motion conserve Hexactly, while their WKE conserves
Hasymptotically, and Eexactly. Here, we are interested in the quantities that are conserved by the WKE and its
reduced model, the SLAM. Therefore, we will simply refer to Eas the energy hereafter.
The interaction coefficient W12
3kis unchanged under global rotations. We further assume that when the system is
forced and dissipated, it is done so in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic manner. Therefore, we expect that the
spectrum nkwill be isotropic, depending only on |k|, or equivalently on frequency. Accordingly, we can consider the
spectrum as a function of either k, or frequency ωat that value of k, via the dispersion relation ω=k2. Namely, we
adopt the notation nωi:=n(ki(ωi)) =nki=:ni. Converting the k-space integrals in Eqs. (10) into integrals over ω,
the invariants of the WKE become, for a 2D isotropic spectrum,
E=πZ
ωnωdω and N=πZ
nωdω. (11)
2. Flux directions - the Fjørtoft argument
The action of the WKE is to redistribute the spectral density of EandNacross k-space. The qualitative manner
of this redistribution is predicted by the argument of Fjørtoft [30]. This argument is recapitulated in many places
in the wave turbulence literature, see for example Refs. [11, 12] for its application to the forced-dissipated SHE, and
Ref. [2] for a version of the argument in freely-evolving systems.
We restrict our discussion to the isotropic case, which allows us to elide from k-space to ω-space via the dispersion
relation, and speak of scales when referring to frequencies. The conclusion of the Fjørtoft argument is that the
presence of each invariant constrains how the ω-space distribution of the other invariant can evolve, so that the bulk
of each invariant moves to the sector of ω-space where its spectral density dominates. For the SHE this means that
the majority of the energy E, which has a spectral density of ω=k2, moves towards high ω, whereas most of the
waveaction N, having a spectral density of 1, moves towards low ω.
More specifically, for a freely-evolving system the Fjørtoft argument predicts that the invariant densities are redis-
tributed by the WKE so that the centroid of E, defined as ( π/E)R
ω2nωdω, moves towards small scales, while the
N-centroid, ( π/N)R
ωnωdω, moves towards the largest scale in the system [2]. The total EandNof course remain
constant during the evolution.
In a forced-dissipated system, EandNare injected at the intermediate forcing scale ωf, and transported by the
WKE until they reach the dissipation scales at ωd−(large scale), and ωd+(small scale), where they are removed. We
assume a wide scale separation ωd−≪ωf≪ωd+. We further assume that the system has reached a non-equilibrium
stationary state in which forcing and dissipation are continuous, and the rate of dissipation has adjusted to match
the rate of forcing, so that the total EandNremain constant. We conjecture that this steady state condition is
universal, independent of the detailed manner of forcing and dissipation, and will be attained from a wide range of
initial conditions after a transient phase. In these circumstances, the Fjørtoft argument predicts that most ofthe
energy injected at ωfwill be transferred with constant positive energy flux Pthrough the direct inertial range
(namely, scales ωsuch that ωf≪ω≪ωd+), to be dissipated at small scales around ωd+. Likewise, most of the
waveaction injected at ωfwill be transferred with constant negative waveaction flux Qthrough the inverse inertial
range ( ωd−≪ω≪ωf), until it is dissipated at large scales near ωd−. This scenario, of one invariant moving to small
scales and the other moving to large scales, is common to all wave turbulence systems with two quadratic invariants,
and also 2D hydrodynamic turbulence [2]. It is referred to in the literature as the dual cascade, although the term
“cascade” usually implies a scale-by-scale flux of invariants in which all the waves taking part in the transfer are
localised in ω-space. We will see that for the SLAM, the direct transfer of energy involves entirely local interactions,
whereas the inverse waveaction transfer is nonlocal, involving waves at ωfparticipating in every tetrad of interacting
waves throughout the inertial range. In this paper we will still speak of the direct cascade of energy, and inverse
cascade of waveaction, which together make up the dual cascade, having made this caveat about the (non)locality of
interactions in these cascades.
The Fjørtoft argument is premised only on having positive-definite integral invariants, which are quadratic in wave
amplitude, but which have different spectral densities, and on having widely-separated forcing and dissipation scales.
Having such parsimonious assumptions, the predictions of the Fjørtoft argument are robust, and must be recovered
by any subtler manipulation of the WKE. More concretely, once we derive the SLAM, we can look for its stationary
solutions that realise the dual cascade, but these solutions must have fluxes P > 0 and Q < 0 in their respective6
inertial ranges, to correspond to the predictions of the Fjørtoft argument. On the other hand, the argument makes no
assumptions about the locality of interactions in ω-space. This must be determined by examining individual candidate
solutions, which is particularly straightforward in the SLAM.
III. DERIVATION OF THE SEMILOCAL APPROXIMATION MODEL
To derive the SLAM, we follow the initial strategy set out in Ref. [4] for deriving the DAM. First, we multiply Eq.
(8) by an arbitrary test function φk=φ(k), integrate with respect to k, and use the resulting symmetries of the
integrand to split it into four pieces:
Z

∂tdk= 4πZ

dk1dk2dk3dk.(12)
Next we assume that the spectra nkand test functions φkare isotropic, and consider both as functions of frequency
(see Sec. II C 1).
At this point, following the discussion after Eq. (9b), we make the semilocality assumption that k1≈k, and hence
k3≈k2, but retain the possibility of k1andk2being distinct. This is in contrast to the procedure of Dyachenko et
al. [4], who assume that allinteractions are superlocal in frequency space.
Taylor expanding the terms in square brackets in Eq. (12) up to first order in frequency, and using Eq. (9b), we
have

θis the angle between p1andp2, see Fig. 1(b). The volume element transforms as dk1=p1dp1dθ, and we perform

FIG. 1. Geometry of wavevectors and definition of angles involved in deriving the SLAM. (a) A tetrad of wavevectors
{k1,k2,k3,k}that satisfy the resonant conditions Eqs. (9) are shown in blue. Note the semilocal approximation k1≈kand
k3≈k2. The difference vectors {pi:=ki−k}are shown in green. (b) Triangle formed by {pi}. Note that due to the frequency
resonance condition δ(ω12
3k) in Eq. (8), only wavevectors with difference vectors that form a right-angle triangle, i.e. θ=π/2,
will contribute to the collision integral, see Appendix A.
This last step highlights the important feature of the SHE in this analysis: it is in this step that we have used the
peaked nature of the interaction coefficient to reduce it to the coefficient SΛanalytically. To our knowledge, the SHE
constitute the first system analysed in wave turbulence theory whose interaction coefficient can be reduced in this
way.
To express the p2dependence of (14) in terms of k2andk, we denote the angle between vectors kandk2byϕ
(see Fig. 1(a)), note that |p2×k|2=|k2×k|2=k2
2k2sin2(ϕ), and use basic trigonometry to re-express p2, giving

(∂ωφω−∂ω2φω2)dk2dk.
Thek↔k2symmetry of the integrand allows us to replace ( . . .) (∂ωφω−∂ω2φω2)→2(. . .) (∂ωφω).
The next step is to move to frequency space by writing the integrations over kandk2in polar form, so that
dk= (1/2)dχ dω anddk2= (1/2)dϕ dω 2. Here χis the polar angle of wavevector k(see Fig. 1(a)), which we integrate
out immediately and cancel from both sides. We obtain

dω2 (17b)
is the waveaction flux flowing through ωin frequency space (or circle of radius k=√ωin wavevector space; the factor
ofπarises from the transformation between the two spaces). In Eq. (17b) the function f(s) is defined as
f(s) =Z2π
0sin2(ϕ)
(1−2scos(ϕ) +s2)3/2dϕ. (17c)
In Appendix B we note some properties of f(s).
The SLAM, defined by Eqs. (17), is the main result of the present paper. The SLAM must be supplemented
with initial and boundary conditions to produce a well-posed problem. To retain consistency with the semilocal8
approximation, the initial condition can be any arbitrary function supported on ω≫Λ, and whose characteristic
scale of variation ∂ω/∂ (lnnω)≫Λ. Respectively, these conditions ensure that W12
3kdecays sufficiently rapidly that
superlocality is satisfied, and that the Taylor expansion in Eq. (13) can be truncated. As mentioned in section II C 2,
we conjecture that the steady-state dual cascade spectra in the forced-dissipated problem will be independent of initial
conditions.
As for the boundary conditions, if one were concerned with a solution on the whole real line then physicality requires
that the spectrum and fluxes vanish as ω→ ∞ . The situation as ω→0 is quite involved, as one expects solutions
that exhibit finite-time blowup there, associated with condensation [31]. At this point not only does the support of
the spectrum violate the ω≫Λ condition, but the system becomes strongly nonlinear, meaning that the WKE (and
hence the SLAM) no longer describes the dynamics. However, when examining the dual cascade spectra, we assume
that dissipation forces the spectrum to vanish at ωd+andωd−. We take these as boundary conditions of the solution
in sections V and VI when we characterise these spectra.
A. Conservation of invariants in the SLAM
To show that the original invariants of the WKE continue to be conserved in the SLAM, we first note that (17a) is
a continuity equation for waveaction, and so Nis manifestly conserved. Secondly, we note that the energy density is
ωnω, and so the continuity equation for energy is
∂(ωnω)
∂t=−1
π∂P
∂ω(18)
where Pis the energy flux. Together with Eq. (17a), this gives ∂ωP=ω∂ωQ. Integrating from 0 to ω, we obtain
P(ω) =ωQ(ω)−Zω
0Q(˜ω)d˜ω. (19)
Integrating Eq. (18) over all ωgives ∂tE=−[P(∞)−P(0)]/π. Using Eq. (19), and assuming that the particle flux
decays fast enough at large and small ω, so that ωQ(ω)|∞=ωQ(ω)|0= 0, we obtain
∂E
∂t=SΛZ∞
0Z∞

˜ωn2
ω2n2
˜ω 
∂˜ωn−1
˜ω−∂ω2n−1
ω2
dω2d˜ω. (20)
Now we observe that by Eq. (B4), the factor ( ω2/√
˜ω)f(p
ω2/˜ω) is symmetric under ˜ ω↔ω2. This leaves the integrand
on the right-hand side of Eq. (20) antisymmetric under exchange of the integration variables, and so we must have
∂tE= 0.
Therefore, in a closed system the SLAM preserves the same quadratic invariants as the WKE from which it is
derived. The rest of this paper is devoted to obtaining solutions of the SLAM, particularly the solutions that realise
the dual cascade of invariants that is predicted by the Fjørtoft argument in a forced-dissipated system.
IV. STATIONARY SOLUTIONS OF THE SLAM
In this section we show that the usual stationary solutions of the WKE—the equilibrium RJ spectrum, and the
KZ cascade spectra—are stationary solutions of the SLAM (17). We are particularly interested in spectra that are
self-similar, i.e. of power-law form nω=Cω−x, where Cis a constant that is positive for physical spectra.
A. Thermodynamic equilibrium (RJ) spectrum
The RJ spectrum describes the state of thermodynamic equilibrium where a linear combination of the integral
invariants is partitioned equally over k-space:
nω=T
µ+ω(equipartition of µN+E), (21)
where the thermodynamic potentials are the temperature Tand chemical potential µ(both constants). This spectrum
is a stationary solution of the SLAM because the bracket 

in Eq. (17b) vanishes when Eq. (21) is
substituted.9
The RJ spectrum has the asymptotic limits
nω∝ω0(equipartition of N),
nω∝ω−1(equipartition of E),(22)
which are self-similar spectra with spectral indices x= 0 and x= 1, respectively.
B. Stationary nonequilibrium cascade (KZ) spectra
As mentioned in Sec. I, in many systems one can find stationary solutions of the WKE that are of power-law
form, and which describe the constant flux of invariants via a self-similar, scale-by-scale cascade. These are the KZ
cascade spectra, and they are the first candidate for the spectra that realise the dual cascade predicted by the Fjørtoft
argument for forced-dissipated systems. When the KZ spectra are physically relevant, the flux of each dynamical
invariant will be described by its own KZ spectrum, and on that spectrum the flux of all other dynamical invariants
will be zero.
To find the KZ spectra, we first substitute nω=Cω−xinto Eq. (17b), giving for the waveaction flux

1. Energy cascade spectrum
In the wave turbulence literature, KZ spectra are frequently found by making non-identity transformations of the
collision integral that allow one to read off spectral indices xthat make the integrand of the transformed collision
integral vanish. This technique is known as the Zakharov-Kraichnan transform [3].
We now adapt this method to the SLAM in order to find the KZ energy cascade spectrum. We split the right-hand
side of Eq. (23) into two halves. In the second half, we substitute ω2=ω2/˜ω2. Using Eq. (B4), and dropping tildes
immediately, we obtain
Q=πSΛC3

2)dω2,
with y= 3x−3/2. Choosing the spectral index x= 1/2 leads to a vanishing waveaction flux Q, suggesting that this
represents the KZ energy cascade spectrum.
To see that this is indeed the case, we extract the overall ωdependence in Eq. (23), leaving a reduced, dimensionless
collision integral I(x), as follows:
Q(ω) = 2 πSΛC3ω(1−6x)/2I(x), where I(x) =xZ∞
0f(s)s3−4x(1−s2x−2)ds, (24)
ands=p
ω2/ω. Substituting Eq. (24) into Eq. (19) gives for the energy flux
P(ω) = 2 πSΛC31−6x
3−6xω(3−6x)/2I(x). (25)
Setting x= 1/2 in Eq. (24) reproduces the result that Q(ω) = 0, because I(1/2)∝R∞
0sf(s)ds−R∞
0f(s)ds, which
vanishes by the s→1/ssymmetry in Eq. (B4) (note that the transformation s→1/sis exactly equivalent to making
the Zakharov-Kraichnan transform).
When x= 1/2, Eq. (25) gives P(ω) = 0 /0. To resolve this indeterminacy we use L’Hˆ opital’s rule, obtaining
P(ω) =2πSΛC3

,
where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to x, and we have again used Eq. (B4).
Thus, when x= 1/2 the energy flux Pis a constant, independent of ω, while the waveaction flux Qvanishes,
indicating that this is indeed the KZ energy cascade spectrum. However, we note that on this spectrum the sign of
Pis negative, which is opposite to the sign predicted by the Fjørtoft argument. We elaborate on this in Sec. V.10
2. Waveaction cascade spectrum
To determine the KZ spectrum for the cascade of waveaction, we put x= 1/6 in Eq. (24), obtaining Q(ω) =
2πSΛC3I(1/6), which is independent of ω. Likewise, Eq. (25) gives P(ω) = 0 ×I(1/6). This would satisfy the
requirements to be the KZ waveaction cascade spectrum if I(1/6) converged. However, from the second equation in
(24) we see that
I(1/6) =1
6Z∞
0f(s)(s7/3−s2/3)ds.
Noting the asymptotic behaviour of f(s) from Eq. (B3c), we see that I(1/6) diverges as s→ ∞ .
Therefore, even though the power-law spectrum with x= 1/6 superficially gives the correct properties for the KZ
waveaction cascade spectrum, we must rule it out because the collision integral is divergent on that spectrum.
3. Summary of KZ spectra
To summarise, the formal KZ cascade spectra that are our first candidates for realising the dual cascade are
nω∝ω−1/2(KZ spectrum: cascade of E),
nω∝ω−1/6(KZ spectrum: cascade of N).(26)
However, both spectra suffer pathologies: on the first spectrum the flux of energy is in the wrong direction, and the
second spectrum causes the collision integral to diverge. We must therefore rule them out, and seek other spectra on
which the dual cascade can be supported.
These pathologies notwithstanding, it is still worth noting that the original interaction coefficient W12
3kis not a
homogeneous function of the four wavevectors, i.e. it possesses no obvious properties that would lead to a self-similar
scaling behaviour. Nevertheless, the semilocality property of W12
3kallows us to integrate out its non-homogeneous part,
giving the constant coefficient SΛ. The resulting equation, the SLAM, is self-similar. However, unlike KZ spectra,
the relevant solutions of the SLAM that manifest the dual cascade do not turn out to be self-similar themselves, as
we demonstrate in the following sections.
C. Interpretation of divergent spectra
As mentioned above, the divergence of the collision integral at a certain scale causes us to rule out a prospective KZ
spectrum. However, we expect the true solution to retain some characteristics indicated by this divergence. Namely,
waves of a scale that approaches the divergent scale will be increasingly dominant in every tetrad of interacting waves
in which they participate. In other words, wave interactions at every scale will be mediated by waves whose scale
approaches the divergent scale. In this situation, the true solution is termed a nonlocal flux spectrum, as opposed to
the spectrally-local cascades that are described by physically-realisable KZ solutions.
In the specific case here, the divergence of the KZ waveaction cascade spectrum as s→ ∞ implies that the true
waveaction flux spectrum is nonlocal, dominated by interactions at ω2≫ω. By contrast, the fact that the KZ
energy cascade spectrum gives convergence of the collision integral signals that the true cascade solution has local
interactions. We need only resolve the matter of the cascade direction, which we do in Sec. V.
In Appendix. C we present a full convergence study of the collision integral on general power-law spectra, allowing
us to see the KZ spectra in their full context. The results of this convergence study are shown in Fig. 2(b).
V. FLUX DIRECTIONS ON POWER-LAW SPECTRA
For the sake of completeness, we present in this section a general diagrammatic argument [2] that determines the
directions of both the energy flux Pand the waveaction flux Q, on all power-law spectra nω=Cω−x(with C >0). In
order to present the argument, we neglect for a moment the divergence of the collision integral on the KZ waveaction
cascade spectrum. Recall that if the sign of a flux is positive (negative), the invariant flows towards large (small) ω.
It is natural to assume that for very sharply peaked spectra, the resulting fluxes will flatten the spectra out. Thus,
forx→ ∞ (spectrum sharply peaked around ω≈0), we expect the associated fluxes to be strongly positive. Likewise
forx→ −∞ (spectrum sharply rising), the fluxes will be strongly negative.11

FIG. 2. (a) Sketch of the energy flux Pand waveaction flux Qdependence on spectral index x, where nω=Cω−x. The signs
of the fluxes are determined by the relative ordering of the RJ and KZ spectra (Eqs. (22) and (26) respectively), where one
or both of the fluxes is zero, and the behaviour at large and small x. The qualitative behaviour of the fluxes in between the
zeros follows by continuity, see Sec. V. (b) Convergence (green) or divergence (red) of Eq. (17b) with respect to spectral index
x. Above the xaxis refers to ω2in the ultraviolet range, and below the xaxis refers to ω2in the infrared range, see Appendix
C. (Convergence is unconditional exactly on the thermodynamic spectra x= 0,1. This is indicated by the narrow green strips
around these two spectra.)
In between these two, the fluxes will both be zero on each of the thermodynamic spectra x= 0,1. As for the
KZ spectra, by construction the KZ energy cascade spectrum is for the pure flux of energy, with no waveaction flux.
Likewise, the energy flux is zero on the KZ spectrum for a pure waveaction cascade. In our case we respectively have
Q= 0 for x= 1/2, and P= 0 for x= 1/6 (were the latter to give a convergent collision integral). Assuming that the
fluxes vary continuously with spectral index xforces them to behave qualitatively as shown in Fig. 2(a).
We see that the ordering of the zero crossings forces Pto be negative on the KZ energy cascade spectrum, as found
in Sec. IV B 1, and also forces Qto be positive on the KZ waveaction cascade spectrum. These are both in direct
contradiction to the conclusion of the Fjørtoft argument, which is that Pmust be positive and Qnegative on the
stationary spectra that realise the direct and inverse portions of the dual cascade, see Sec. II C 2. If the respective
flux-carrying solutions are to be realised by the KZ spectra, the only way to reconcile the two arguments is for the
KZ spectra to have non-positive (i.e. negative or even complex) prefactor constants C, which is clearly unphysical.
Therefore, we conclude once more that the KZ spectra found in Sec. IV cannot realise the dual cascade in any
physically-relevant scenario.
As the KZ spectrum must be ruled out, the true solution to realise a steady-state cascade must be related to the
other stationary solution: the RJ spectrum [4]. Indeed, experience with other wave turbulence systems suggests that
the true cascade solution is an RJ spectrum with small deviations that are nonetheless responsible for carrying the
entire flux, see Eq. (27). Such solutions are termed warm cascade spectra [4, 10, 12].
We therefore hypothesise that the flux-carrying spectra that realise the dual cascade are warm spectra in both
the direct and inverse inertial ranges. However, anticipating the results of Sec. VI, we will conclude that the inverse
cascade of Nis not only nonlocal in character, but is also realised by a warm spectrum with negative thermodynamic
potentials Tandµ.
By contrast, the convergence of the KZ energy cascade spectrum found in Sec. IV B 1, and the discussion of Sec.
IV C, indicate that the true direct cascade of Eis local. We therefore expect the direct cascade to be warm, with
positive Tandµ, and spectrum

Here, ∆( ω) is the deviation from the RJ spectrum, which remains small in the inertial range, far from the forcing

It is a prediction from the superlocal DAM that the warm spectrum terminates in a logarithmic compact front,
and that the temperature of the cascade spectrum Tis determined by the energy flux P, and small-scale dissipation
range ωd+[12]. We leave it to future work, reinforced by numerical simulations, to examine these relations for the
direct warm cascade realised by the SLAM.
VI. NONLOCAL INVERSE CASCADE SOLUTION
In this section, we seek the stationary solution of the SLAM that realises a constant inverse flux of waveaction, and
that is nonlocal in the sense suggested by the divergence of the corresponding KZ spectrum, see Sec. IV C. We also
seek to parameterise the solution in terms of quantities that we can control externally, for example in simulations.
These will turn out to be the flux Q, the forcing and dissipation scales ωfandωd−, and the temperature of the inverse
warm cascade T.
We set Qto be negative in Eq. (17b) to specify an inverse flux, and substitute f(s) =π/s3, its ω2≫ωlimit.
Equation (17b) becomes
∂nω
∂ω=ˆQ
Aω+B

where ˆQ=−Q/π2SΛ>0 and the integrals over ω2are absorbed into the constants
A=Zn2
ω2√ω2dω2and B=Z1√ω2∂nω2
∂ω2dω2. (29)
Manifestly A > 0. Self-consistency of the asymptotic solutions of Eq. (28) demands that B > 0 also (see discussion
after Eq. (31) below).
A. Nonlocal inverse cascade: asymptotics
First, we examine the asymptotics of Eq. (28) to extract key characteristics of the full solution. We denote the
frequency at which the two terms on the right-hand side are equal by ωs.
Forω≪ωsthe first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (28) dominates. The solution to the resulting asymptotic
equation is
n≪
ω=ˆQ
Alnω
ωd−
. (30)13
Here we have written the constant of integration as the frequency at which the solution n≪
ωvanishes, and interpreted it
as the dissipation scale ωd−. Note that the solution finds a vanishing point naturally, without specifying a dissipation
mechanism. This is in common with warm solutions of superlocal DAMs that contain compact fronts at which the
solution vanishes logarithmically, see e.g. [10, 12]. (We expect that if dissipation is not provided, so that the flux is
drained from the system by the time it reaches ωd−, the spectrum would grow in this vicinity so that the situation
would not be time-independent. Eventually the nonlinearity would become strong here, so that the wave turbulence
assumptions would become violated.)
Forω≫ωsthe second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (28) is dominant, and we have the asymptotic solution
n≫
ω=A/B
ω∗−ω. (31)
Here the constant of integration appears as ω∗, the frequency at which the solution becomes singular. By hypothesis,
ω∗is greater than any ωin the inverse cascade range. The integral of n≫
ωis weakly (logarithmically) divergent as
ω→ω∗, which is consistent with the assumption of a nonlocal solution that is dominated by interactions with ω2≫ω.
Obviously, in any realistic scenario the solution cannot continue up to ω∗. We therefore cut the solution off at ωf
where ωd−≪ωf< ω∗. This cutoff represents the end of the inverse cascade inertial range; in a forced-dissipated
setup this is none other than the forcing scale. By choosing ωfin the vicinity of ω∗, so that ω2can approach the
singularity frequency ω∗, we keep consistency with the nonlocality assumption ω2≫ω.
If we define the temperature T:=−A/B and chemical potential µ:=−ω∗, we also see that n≫
ωis actually a ther-
modynamic spectrum (21) with negative Tandµ. The interpretation of RJ equilibria with negative thermodynamic
potentials was given in Ref. [32] for the case of three sign-definite invariants. For the present case with two invariants,
these are exactly equilibria with spectra diverging at some nonzero µ(see appendix of Ref. [32]).
Note that, had we chosen B < 0, we would have obtained the asymptotic solution nB<0
ω=A/|B|(ω+ω∗). For
ω∗<0 this is negative in 0 < ω < |ω∗|, which is unphysical. For ω∗≥0, if we substitute nB<0
ωback into Eq. (28),
the first term on the right-hand side dominates for all ω≥0, which is inconsistent with the assumptions for deriving
nB<0
ω. We therefore rule out the B < 0 case. Had we chosen B= 0, the full solution n≪
ωis the only solution, but
then the second integral in (29) gives B̸= 0. Hence, we rule out B= 0 as well, and therefore we must have B >0.
Thus, the full solution of Eq. (28) resembles an RJ spectrum for ω≫ωd−, Eq. (31), but has a deviation that grows
towards the infrared, and that terminates at ω=ωd−with a logarithmic compact front, Eq. (30). This is exactly to
say that it is a warm cascade spectrum, but with negative thermodynamic potentials.
1. Determination of constants AandB
The integrals in Eqs. (29) must be taken over the whole inverse cascade range, from ωd−up to ωf. Since the inverse
cascade spectrum is nonlocal, the dominant contributions to the integrals occurs at large ω. Using the asymptotic
spectrum n≫
ω, and evaluating Eqs. (29) at the upper limit ωf, we obtain, to leading order, B2/A= 1/√ωf(ω∗−ωf).
In terms of the temperature Tthis gives
A=T2
√ωf(ω∗−ωf)and B=−T√ωf(ω∗−ωf), (32)
i.e. we have expressed AandBin terms of T, ωfandω∗.
B. Nonlocal inverse cascade: full solution
Equation (28) can be solved analytically by noting that it is a Ricatti equation. Using standard techniques [33], its
solution is found to be

,with K=2q
BˆQω
A, (33)
where Jn(K), Yn(K) are n-th order Bessel functions of the first and second kinds respectively, and cis the constant
of integration.
We can relate cto the integration constants of the asymptotic solutions by noting that ωd−corresponds to the first
zero of the right-hand side of Eq. (33). This will be at the first root of the numerator Y0(K) +J0(K)c. Using the14
asymptotics of the Bessel functions for K≪1 gives, to leading order,
ωd−=A2
BˆQe−2γ−πc, (34)
where γ≈0.5772 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Likewise, ω∗corresponds to the first root of Y1(K) +J1(K)c, the
denominator of Eq. (33). To leading order this gives
A2
BˆQω∗+ lnA2
BˆQω∗
=πc+ 2γ−1. (35)
This has solution ω∗=A2/[BˆQ W(eπc+2γ−1)], where W(x) is the Lambert-W function.
Firstly, we note that the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (35) is dominant as we send c→ ∞ , while the
left-hand side is greater than A2/(BˆQω∗). This gives ω−1
∗(c) =O(c), whereas from Eq. (34), ωd−→0 exponentially
asc→ ∞ . Thus, the ratio ωd−/ω∗→0 asc→ ∞ , and so by adjusting A, B, and ˆQto set the overall scaling, we can
make the inverse inertial range arbitrarily wide.
Furthermore, we can eliminate cbetween Eqs. (34) and (35), and eliminate AandBusing Eq. (32), obtaining
lnω∗
ωd−
= 1 +T3
ˆQ√ωf(ω∗−ωf)ω∗. (36)
Equation (36) implicitly expresses ω∗in terms of the control parameters ( ˆQ, T, ω f, ωd−). Solving for ω∗(for example
numerically, or to any desired accuracy by iteration), and substituting into Eq. (32) allows AandBto be written in
terms of the same set of parameters. We can likewise express cvia Eq. (34), and finally obtain the solution nωvia
Eq. (33), in terms of the control parameters ( ˆQ, T, ω f, ωd−).
Note that, unlike the case for superlocal DAMs, we cannot close the set of control parameters by writing Tas
a function of the flux and the forcing and dissipation scales. This is reminiscent of two-free-parameter stationary
solutions of the Leith model [6]. (Closures could be provided by specific assumptions about the forcing or dissipation,
for example that the forcing starts with a given flux and temperature, but these assumptions would not be universal.)
In Fig. 3 we sketch the qualitative behaviour of the nonlocal inverse waveaction cascade spectrum ninv
ωin blue.
We also show the asymptotic solutions n≪
ωandn≫
ωin white dashes, and the frequency ω∗where the inverse cascade
spectrum becomes singular.
VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
A. Comparison with the NLSE and SNE limits
Before concluding, we make some remarks about the two limits of the SHE that were mentioned in Sec. II. The first
is the NLSE limit, where we send α,Λ→ ∞ , while α/Λ→const. After rescaling ψwe obtain Eq. (2). The second is
the SNE limit, where we set Λ = 0 to obtain Eqs. (3).
In both these limits, the interaction coefficient becomes a homogeneous function, in the sense that Wµk1,µk2
µk3,µk=
µβWk1,k2
k3,k, with β= 0 in the NLSE limit and β=−2 in the SNE limit. This observation allowed us to heuristically
construct superlocal DAMs of the NLSE and SNE in Ref. [12]. There, we used the DAMs to examine the respective KZ
spectra, and found that in both cases the flux directions contradicted the Fjørtoft argument. We therefore proposed
that the flux-carrying spectra were warm spectra in both the NLSE and SNE. We are now in a position to revisit this
work, in light of the rigorously-derived SLAM.
The first thing to note is that in the NLSE limit, the interaction coefficient becomes a constant across all wavevectors.
In particular, this no longer respects the semilocality property: pairs of wavevectors are no longer picked out by the
sharp decay of the interaction coefficient. We therefore cannot approximate the full WKE by the SLAM—to do so
would neglect the majority of wave interactions, all of which are important in evolving the spectrum. However, we
can still use the DAM for qualitative understanding, e.g. the argument about flux directions and the prediction of
warm cascades [4, 12].
By contrast, the SNE are a singular limit of the SHE. We noted in Sec. II that the SNE are ill-posed, and that
their regularisation requires restoring Λ ̸= 0, i.e. moving to the SHE. To elaborate: in order to develop the wave
turbulence theory and derive the WKE, one starts with a periodic system [2], but in a periodic system, Eq. (3b) has
no non-trivial solutions. Once we derive the SLAM, this ill-posedness is revealed in Eq. (15): setting Λ = 0 sends15
SΛ→ ∞ , i.e. the SLAM diverges for every spectrum nω. This indicates that one can formally write down the kinetic
equation of the SNE, but the collision integral becomes infinite when any two wavevectors become equal. Likewise,
one can obtain KZ spectra for the SNE based on dimensional arguments, but these spectra will be invalid because the
collision integral will be divergent on these spectra. Moreover, the KZ spectra will change discontinuously when we
regularise the kinetic equation by setting Λ ̸= 0. This is indeed what we find when we compare the KZ spectra found
in Ref. [12] (namely ω0for the KZ waveaction cascade spectrum, and ω−1/3for the KZ energy cascade spectrum, for
the 2D case) to Eqs. (26).
Thus, we see that retaining Λ ̸= 0 in the SHE is necessary in order to regularise the singular SNE limit. This
is a salutary lesson as it highlights the hidden pitfalls of such heuristic derivations of DAMs: their predictions are
misleading if, as in our case, they do not respect essential properties of the original interaction coefficient. We speculate
that a similar derivation of a semilocal model might be applied to other examples in the literature, e.g. in the theory
of gravitational waves in Einstein’s vacuum field model [34].
B. Conclusion
Starting from the wave kinetic equation of the SHE, we have rigorously derived a reduced kinetic equation, the
SLAM, by exploiting the natural locality properties of the interaction coefficient. We believe this to be the first such
derivation of a reduced kinetic equation in which the locality assumption can be justified self-consistently.
Having derived the SLAM, we use it to obtain the stationary spectra that are responsible for realising the dual
cascade of energy and waveaction that is predicted by the Fjørtoft argument. After deriving the formal KZ cascade
spectra, and examining their flux directions and locality, we conclude that neither the direct cascade of energy nor
inverse cascade of waveaction are realised by the respective KZ spectra.
Instead, we predict that the dual cascade is carried by warm spectra. This concurs with our examination of the
limits of the SHE in Ref. [12], even though some of that was carried out in the SNE limit, which is, in fact, singular.
Here, though, the SLAM allows us to refine our prediction about the character of the warm spectra. We predict
that the direct energy cascade spectrum will have positive thermodynamic parameters, and that interactions will
be between waves that are local in frequency. By contrast, the inverse cascade of waveaction will be carried by a
nonlocal spectrum, with interactions at every frequency ωbeing dominated by the spectrum near the forcing scale ωf.
Accordingly, we derive a nonlocal, warm, inverse cascade spectrum, that is parameterised by a negative temperature
and chemical potential.
Our results on the dual cascade were derived for the forced-dissipated 2D SHE, which is the setup that leads to
the clearest manifestation of the cascades. Results on the inverse cascade may also apply to the case of turbulence
that evolves freely from an initial condition in a closed system, due to the inverse cascade having finite capacity
(the integral of the inverse cascade spectrum converges when we send ωd−→0). Experience with finite capacity
KZ spectra shows that an initial condition fills out its respective inertial range in finite time, with the KZ spectrum
establishing after an initial transient [8, 35, 36]. It remains to be tested whether this phenomenology carries over to
the inverse cascade spectrum of the SHE. By contrast, the direct cascade has infinite capacity for energy (the integral
defining energy diverges as ωd+→ ∞ ), and so it can absorb an arbitrary amount of energy that is sent into it, unless
there is some small-scale cutoff that arrests the direct cascade e.g. the finite numerical resolution of a simulation. For
such systems, the cascade spectrum typically does not form behind the front that propagates from an initial condition,
unless continuously forced.
The finite-capacity inverse cascade cannot absorb an arbitrary amount of waveaction. If no large-scale dissipation
is provided, waveaction will arrive at the end of the inertial range and start to accumulate into coherent large-scale
structures: condensates and solitons. The dynamics of these structures are attracting much interest, particularly in
astrophysics, where they could represent galactic dark matter halos [21, 37–39], or their 1D and 2D analogues in
nonlinear optics [24, 40–42]. The dual cascade process is a universal mechanism whereby such large-scale structures
emerge due to the interaction of weakly turbulent small-scale waves, at least in the initial transient phase where weak
waves exist without any coherent structures present.
Our results are therefore directly applicable to the 2D case, which may be accessible in optical experiments. Indeed,
experiments modelled by the 2D SHE have already been conducted, using thermo-optic crystals as the nonlinear
medium, particularly in the context of tabletop analogues of dark matter haloes or boson stars [40, 43, 44]. 1D liquid
crystal experiments were carried out specifically looking at the wave turbulence of the SHE [11], and it would be
feasible to extend this to a 2D experiment.
The next step in this work is an extensive numerical comparison of the SHE, its WKE, and the SLAM, in both the
freely-evolving and forced-dissipated case. This is currently in progress by the authors and will be published separately
at a later date. Such a comparison was recently carried out for the NLSE and its WKE [45, 46]. Furthermore, we
envisage that one could derive a similar SLAM for the 3D SHE, which will be applicable to the turbulent formation16
of galactic dark matter halos, and the 1D SHE, relevant to optical experiments such as those carried out in [47]. The
same methodology should carry over to those cases, with the technical subtlety in the 1D case, the leading-order wave
process is 6-wave, rather than the 4-wave case in 2D and 3D.

Appendix A: Wavevectors relative to k form a right-angle triangle
Waves on the resonant manifold are constrained to have a particular geometric relation. The frequency and
wavevector resonance conditions (9) give
ω12
3k= (k1−k)·(k1+k) + (k2−k3)·(k2+k3)
= 2(k1−k)·(k−k2) = 0 . (A1)
Recalling the definition pi:=ki−k, we thus have that p1is orthogonal to p2. A similar calculation gives the
Pythagorean relation p2
1+p2
2=p2
3. We conclude that on the resonant manifold, p1,p2,p3form a right-angle triangle,
see Fig. 1(b).
Appendix B: Properties of f(s)
In this appendix we examine the function
f(s) =Z2π
0sin2(ϕ)
(1−2scos(ϕ) +s2)3/2dϕ, (B1)
where in our application to the SLAM (17), s=p
ω2/ωand so 0 ≤s <∞.
1. Writing f(s)in terms of complete elliptic integrals
Writing Eq. (B1) as a derivative, integrating by parts, using symmetry under ϕ→2π−ϕ, and double-angle formulae,
we obtain
f(s) =−Z2π
0sin(ϕ)
s∂
∂ϕ

where
K(z) =Zπ/2
01q
1−zsin2(σ)dσand E(z) =Zπ/2
0q
1−zsin2(σ)dσ
are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, respectively, and σ=ϕ/2.17
2. Asymptotics of f(s)
From Eq. (B2), and using the asymptotics of K(z) and E(z) around s= 0,1,∞, we obtain
f(s) =π+O(s2) as s→0, (B3a)
f(s) =−2 ln|s−1|+O(1) as s→1, (B3b)
f(s) =π
s3+O1
s5
as s→ ∞ . (B3c)
The integrand in Eq. (B1) is undefined at s= 1 when ϕ= 0. This behaviour is resolved by Eq. (B3b): we see
thatf(s) has a logarithmic singularity as s→1. This singularity is integrable in Eq. (17b) as long as the rest of the
integrand is regular as ω2→ω. This regularity holds for all cases presented in this paper.
3.f(s)with reciprocal argument
Note that from Eqs. (B1) and (B2), transforming s→1/sgives
f(1/s) =s3f(s). (B4)
Appendix C: Locality of power-law spectra
In this appendix we carry out an analysis of the convergence of the collision integral for general power-law spectra
nω=Cω−x. We do this for completeness, and as a demonstration of the ease of analysis that the SLAM permits.
The integral in Eq. (23) could diverge as ω2→0 orω2→ ∞ . The behaviour of f(s) in these ranges is noted in
Appendix B 2.
Forω2→ ∞ , i.e. s→ ∞ , we have that f(s)→π/s3, therefore Q∝R∞ω1−3/2−2x
2 (1−ωx−1
2)dω2, which is
convergent for x >max{1/4,−1/2}= 1/4.
Forω2→0, i.e. s→0, we have f(s)→π, and so Q∝R
0ω1−2x
2(1−ωx−1
2)dω2, which is convergent for x≤1.
For either choice of ω2, the waveaction and energy equipartition spectra lead to convergence of the collision integral,
since the factor ( ∂ωn−1
ω−∂ω2n−1
ω2) in Eq. (17b) vanishes exactly for any RJ spectrum (21).
Thus, for ω2→ ∞ , the SLAM converges for power-law spectra with spectral index x∈ {(1/4,∞)∪0}, and for
ω2→0 it converges for x∈(−∞,1]. Otherwise, the SLAM is divergent. These convergence (green) and divergence
(red) zones are indicated in Fig. 2(b), for the two choices of ω2→ ∞ or 0, above and below the xaxis respectively.
The thin green (convergence) strips around the thermodynamic spectra are indicative only, and in reality shrink to
the single points x= 0,1.
We see that the KZ energy cascade spectrum, with x= 1/2, gives convergence of the SLAM, whereas the KZ
waveaction cascade spectrum, with x= 1/6, gives divergence as ω2→ ∞ (These results were found in Sec. IV B, but
now we see them in their full context of convergence or divergence on general power-law spectra).
Note that analysing the locality of general power-law spectra is made possible in the SLAM precisely because of
thesemilocality manifested by the interaction coefficient of the SHE. This analysis is not possible when working with
a DAM, because in order to construct a DAM one assumes (without proof) from the outset that interacting waves
are superlocal.
