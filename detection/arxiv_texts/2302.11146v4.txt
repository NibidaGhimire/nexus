Abstract
We present a uniﬁed treatment of the gravitational and cosmo logical redshift, the Doppler eﬀect
due to the moving observer or light source, and the time dilat ion in the gravitational ﬁeld in the
framework of general relativity. The primary purpose of thi s paper is to extend the description
of Narlikar (1994) on the uniﬁed approach towards the redshi fts and the Doppler eﬀect in a more
generalized form, with the help of the four facts extracted f rom the comprehensive review article
by Ellis (1971). We apply it to the cases of moving observer or light source in the gravitational
ﬁeld and obtain the Doppler eﬀect term, in addition to the stan dard gravitational or cosmological
redshift. Thesecondary purposeis to explicitly show that t he time dilation of a moving clock in the
gravitational ﬁeld can also be understood within the same fr amework of the uniﬁed treatment. We
examine the time dilation of the moving clock on geodesic in t he gravitational ﬁeld. We also derive
the time dilation of the moving clock on elliptical orbit, ba sed on the same uniﬁed treatment. The
tertiary purpose is to show that we can understand special-r elativistic eﬀects without using the
Lorentz transformation. We derive the special-relativist ic formulae such as the Doppler eﬀect and
aberration of light, the kinetic time dilation, and the Lore ntz contraction in the general-relativistic
framework.
1I. INTRODUCTION
TheDopplereﬀectoflightisusuallyexplainedusing theLorentztrans formationinspecial
relativity. In the presence of gravity, however, the Lorentz tra nsformation does not hold.
Narlikar1described a uniﬁed approach to bring the gravitational and cosmolo gical red-
shifts within the same framework as the Doppler shift. (See also Sch r¨ odinger2and Synge3.)
In this paper, we extend the approach by Narlikar1in a more generalized form, with
the help of the four facts extracted from the comprehensive rev iew article by Ellis4, which
was not referred by Narlikar1. The description of Ellis4is originally intended to apply to
observations in cosmological models. Thanks to the covariant feat ure of the description,
however, it can also be applied to other situations, including the grav itational redshift in
the Schwarzschild spacetime and even to the purely special relativis tic situations.
The uniﬁed treatment is simply based on the following facts (which are extracted from
the comprehensive review article by Ellis4):
I. Light obeys the null geodesic equation, i.e., the propagation 4-ve ctorkµsatisﬁes
kµ
;νkν= 0, kµkµ= 0,
which will be summarized in Sec. IIA.
II. The frequency of light measured by an observer with 4-velocity uµis
ω=−kµuµ,
which will be explained in Sec. IIE.
III. The 4-velocities of two observers with relative velocity Vare related by
¯uµ=uµ+Veµ
√
1−V2, eµeµ= 1, eµuµ= 0,
which will be explained in Sec. IIC.
IV. The propagation 4-vector of light kµcan be decomposed into
kµ=ω(uµ+γµ), γµγµ= 1, γµuµ= 0,
which will be explained in Sec. IIE.
2In the descriptions by Narlikar1and Ellis4, facts I and II are assumed. Facts III and IV,
which are described in the article by Ellis4, are the keys to extend the uniﬁed treatment.
Inorder tounderstand theDopplereﬀect, thegravitationaland thecosmological redshifts
in a uniﬁed manner, the four facts I-IV are the essential and deﬁn itive tools. Since the
Doppler eﬀect and the redshifts are used so often in diﬀerent cont exts and in diﬀerent
interpretations (see Refs. 5 and 6 for example), it is worth again ap preciating the uniﬁed
treatment of them according to the four facts described by Ellis4. This is the primary
purpose of this paper.
After extracting the four facts I-IV from the comprehensive re view article by Ellis4in a
slightly simpliﬁed form, we utilize them to derive the basic formulae for t he Doppler eﬀect
and the redshift in a uniﬁed manner.
The main advantages of our approach over Narlikar’s1are as follows. First, with the
help of the facts I-IV, we can clarify the deﬁnitions, the equivalenc e, and the distinctions
of the frequency shifts in the following way: The redshift zof a source as measured by a
“standard” observer with 4-velocity uµis deﬁned by the ratio of the two frequencies at the
diﬀerent points in the spacetime:
1+z=(kµuµ)source
(kµuµ)observer.
If the light, denoted by the 4-vector kµ, is propagating through the static spacetime, say, the
Schwarzschild, zis called the gravitational redshift. If the light is propagating throu gh the
expanding universe, the same zis called the cosmological redshift. On the other hand, the
Doppler eﬀect is expressed by the following ratio of the two frequen cies at the same point
in the spacetime:
(kµ¯uµ)source
(kµuµ)sourceor(kµuµ)observer
(kµ¯uµ)observer.
Those will be explained in Sec. IIFandIIG.
Second, although Narlikar1only considered the radial motion, thus only the longitudinal
Doppler eﬀects, combining facts III and IV enables us to show that the well-known formulae
for the Doppler eﬀect and the aberration of light
¯ω=ω√
1−V2
1−Vcos¯ϑ,cos¯ϑ=cosϑ+V
1+Vcosϑ
hold for any incident angle ϑin both special and general relativity, which will be explained
in Sec.IIG. It should be noted that the Lorentz transformation is not requir ed to derive
these formulae.
3The secondary purpose of this paper is to explicitly show that the tim e dilation of a
moving clock in the gravitational ﬁeld can also be understood within th e same framework of
the uniﬁed treatment. Since the time dilation is closely related to the g ravitational redshift,
it is instructive to show that all we need is the four facts I-IV to und erstand the time dilation
in special and general relativity.
The tertiarypurpose is to show that we canunderstand special-re lativistic eﬀects without
using the Lorentz transformation. Thanks to the covariant form ulation of the basic princi-
ples and equations presented in this paper, they hold also in special-r elativistic situations.
Therefore, we can derive special-relativistic formulae such as the D oppler eﬀect and aberra-
tion of light, the kinetic time dilation (often called as the special-relativ istic time dilation),
and the Lorentz contraction in the general-relativistic framework .
We apply the uniﬁed treatment to the cases of moving observer or lig ht source in the
gravitational ﬁeld, and investigate the Doppler eﬀect due to the mo ving observer or source.
We also investigate the time dilation of a moving clock on geodesic in the g ravitational
ﬁeld. We examine the time dilation of the the moving clocks on radial orb it, circular orbit,
and non-circular elliptical orbit. We use the unit c= 1. Greek indices run from 0 to 3.
II. BASIC PRINCIPLES AND EQUATIONS
We brieﬂy summarize the basic principles and equations for light ray ob servation in the
gravitational ﬁeld. Most of them are described in the review article b y Ellis4.
A. The null geodesic equation for light rays
Let us deﬁne the propagation 4-vector kµ. The light rays whose tangent vector is kµare
null geodesics7:
kµ≡dxµ
dv, (1)
kµ
;νkν= 0, (2)
kµkµ= 0, (3)
wherevis an aﬃne parameter along the null geodesic. It is sometimes more co nvenient to
use the geodesic equation for the covariant components kµ=gµνkν. Fromkµ;νkν= 0, we
4obtain
dkµ
dv=1
2gαβ,µkαkβ. (4)
It is convenient in the following sense: if the metric does not depend o n some coordinate,
say,x0, Eq. (4) immediately shows us the existence of the conserved quantity:
ifgαβ,0= 0, (5)
thendk0
dv=1
2gαβ,0kαkβ= 0, (6)
∴k0= const. (7)
B. The geodesic equation for observers
Let us deﬁne the tangent 4-vector uµof the world line of an observer. If the observer
is moving in the gravitational ﬁeld without any other forces except g ravity,uµobeys the
geodesic equation:
uµ=gµνuν=gµνdxν
dτ, (8)
duµ
dτ=1
2gαβ,µuαuβ, (9)
uµuµ=−1, (10)
whereτis the proper time as an aﬃne parameter along the geodesic.
C. The composition rule of 4-velocities
Let us consider two observers AandB, whose 4-velocities are uµ
A≡uµanduµ
B≡¯uµ
respectively. They are at the same point in the spacetime and obser verBis moving from
observer Awith relative velocity V. We can write the following composition rule8:
¯uµ=uµ+Veµ
√
1−V2, (11)
eµeµ= 1, (12)
eµuµ= 0, (13)
where the unit space-like vector eµrepresents the direction of observer B’s motion in the
observer A’s rest frame. A simple proof of the composition rule is given in Appendix A.
5The inverse relation of the composition rule, which is based on the obs erverB’s rest
frame, is
uµ=¯uµ−V¯eµ
√
1−V2, (14)
¯eµ¯eµ= 1, (15)
¯eµ¯uµ= 0, (16)
where ¯eµrepresents the direction of observer A’s motion in the observer B’s rest frame.
Actually, Eq. ( 14)shows thatobserver Aismoving inthedirection −¯eµwithrelative velocity
Vin the observer B’s rest frame.
Using Eqs. ( 11) and (14) and eliminating ¯ uµ, we obtain
¯eµ=eµ+Vuµ
√
1−V2. (17)
In the same way, we can also obtain
eµ=¯eµ−V¯uµ
√
1−V2. (18)
D. The Lorentz factor
From Eqs. ( 11) and (17), we can directly calculate the Lorentz factor γ:
γ≡1√
1−V2=−uµ¯uµ=eµ¯eµ. (19)
The Lorentz factor γis the invariant 4-scalar because it is calculated from the inner produ ct
of the 4-vectors uµand ¯uµ, oreµand ¯eµ.
E. The decomposition of the propagation 4-vector of light
We introduce the following decomposition of the propagation 4-vect orkµof light with
respect to the observer’s 4-velocity. Consider the observer Awith 4-velocity uµ. Usinguµ,
kµis decomposed into9
kµ=ω(uµ+γµ), (20)
γµγµ= 1, (21)
γµuµ= 0, (22)
6where
ω≡ −kµuµ(23)
is the frequency measured by observer A, and the space-like unit vector γµrepresents the
direction of light in the observer A’s rest frame.
The decomposition can also be made with respect to the observer B’s 4-velocity ¯ uµ:
kµ= ¯ω(¯uµ+ ¯γµ), (24)
¯γµ¯γµ= 1, (25)
¯γµ¯uµ= 0, (26)
where
¯ω≡ −kµ¯uµ(27)
is the frequency of the same light denoted by kµmeasured by the moving observer B, and
¯γµrepresents the direction of light in the observer B’s rest frame.
F. The redshift
The redshift10zof a source as measured by a “standard” observer with 4-velocity uµis
deﬁned by the ratio of the two frequencies at the diﬀerent points in the spacetime:
1+z≡ωsource
ωobserver=(kµuµ)source
(kµuµ)observer. (28)
If the light, denoted by the tangent vector kµ, is propagating through the static spacetime,
say, the Schwarzschild, zis called the gravitational redshift. (In case z <0, it is called the
blueshift.) If the light is propagating through the expanding univers e, the same Eq. ( 28) is
called the cosmological redshift.
G. The Doppler eﬀect
Whereas the “standard” redshift is deﬁned by Eq. ( 28), the Doppler eﬀect is expressed
by the following ratio of the two frequencies at the same point in the s pacetime:
¯ωsource
ωsource=(kµ¯uµ)source
(kµuµ)sourceorωobserver
¯ωobserver=(kµuµ)observer
(kµ¯uµ)observer, (29)
7where ¯uµ, as deﬁned by Eq. ( 11), is the 4-velocity of the moving observer or source with
relative velocity V. As Narlikar1wrote, “in general relativity one cannot talk of a velocity of
relative motionbetween two objects separated spatially”. Then, h e proceeded to the parallel
transport argument for the cosmological and Doppler shifts. Com pared to the Narlikar’s
argument, our deﬁnition of the Doppler eﬀect is much more simpliﬁed. It is guaranteed to
hold in general relativity by deﬁnition.
In general, therefore, the redshift ¯ zof a moving source by a moving observer can be
decomposed into the “standard” redshift part and the Doppler te rms as follows:
1+ ¯z≡¯ωsource
¯ωobserver(30)
=¯ωsource
ωsource·(1+z)·ωobserver
¯ωobserver. (31)
In special relativity, there is neither gravitational nor cosmologica l redshifts, then z= 0.
Therefore, from Eq. ( 31), we recover the usual Doppler formula
¯ωsource
¯ωobserver=¯ωsource
ωsource·ωobserver
¯ωobserverin special relativity. (32)
The relation between ωof Eq. (23) and ¯ωof Eq. (27) can be obtained in the following
way. Using Eqs. ( 14) and (24),
ω=−kµuµ(33)
=−¯ω(¯uµ+ ¯γµ)¯uµ−V¯eµ
√
1−V2(34)
= ¯ω1+Vcos¯θ√
1−V2, (35)
where cos ¯θ≡¯γµ¯eµ, namely, ¯θrepresents the angle between the direction of motion and the
direction of light propagation in observer B’s rest frame.
The Doppler formula for the moving observer is then
¯ω=ω√
1−V2
1−Vcos¯ϑ, (36)
where¯ϑ≡π−¯θis the angle of incidence in the observer B’s rest frame. Actually, ¯ϑis the
angle between ¯ eµand the direction of the source −¯γµ. In particular for the observer moving
away from the source at rest, setting ¯ϑ=πin Eq. (36) and inserting it to Eq. ( 31), we
obtain
1+ ¯z= (1+z)·ωobserver
¯ωobserver= (1+z)·/radicalbigg
1+V
1−V. (37)
8The formula for the moving source can also be obtained in the following way. Using
Eqs. (11) and (20),
¯ω=−kµ¯uµ(38)
=−ω(uµ+γµ)uµ+Veµ
√
1−V2(39)
=ω1−Vcosθ√
1−V2, (40)
where cos θ≡γµeµandθrepresents the angle between the direction of motion and the
direction of light propagation in observer A’s rest frame. The Doppler formula for the
moving source is then
ω= ¯ω√
1−V2
1+Vcosϑ, (41)
whereϑ≡π−θis the angle of incidence in observer A’s rest frame. In particular for the
source moving away from the observer at rest, setting ϑ= 0 in Eq. ( 41) and and inserting
it to Eq. ( 31), we obtain
1+ ¯z=¯ωsource
ωsource·(1+z) = (1+ z)·/radicalbigg
1+V
1−V, (42)
which gives the same result as of Eq. ( 37).
H. The aberration
Using Eqs. ( 36) and (41) and eliminating ¯ ω/ω, we obtain the formula for the aberration
of light:
cos¯ϑ=cosϑ+V
1+Vcosϑ. (43)
A useful inequality for 0 < ϑ < π, 0<¯ϑ < πis
cos¯ϑ−cosϑ=Vsin2ϑ
1+Vcosϑ>0, (44)
∴¯ϑ < ϑ. (45)
The formulae Eqs. ( 36), (41), and (43) look quite well known and seem nothing new.
However, we emphasize that all quantities ω,¯ω,ϑ,¯ϑ, andVare deﬁned as the invariant 4-
scalars. The formulae hold in any coordinate systems in any spacetim e, in general relativity
as well as in special relativity.
9III. THE GRAVITATIONAL REDSHIFT AND THE DOPPLER EFFECT IN THE
SCHWARZSCHILD SPACETIME
A. The metric of the Schwarzschild spacetime
The metric of the Schwarzschild spacetime is

1−rg
r+r2(dθ2+sin2θdφ2), (46)
whererg≡2GMis the Schwarzschild radius.
B. The solution of the null geodesic equation
Thanks to the spherically symmetric property of the Schwarzschild spacetime, we may
consider the orbit of light to be conﬁned to the equatorial plane. Th en,
x2=θ=π
2, (47)
k2=dx2
dv= 0. (48)
The Schwarzschild metric Eq. ( 46) does not depend on x0=t, x3=φ, then the following
conserved quantities are immediately obtained from Eq. ( 4).
k0= const. ≡ −ωc,∴k0=ωc
1−rg
r, (49)
k3= const. ≡l,∴k3=l

Finally, the null condition kµkµ= 0 provides the equation for k1as follows:

. (52)
C. The 4-velocity of the observer at rest
If an observer is at rest in the Schwarzschild spacetime, the 4-velo city is written as
uµ=
1/radicalBig
1−rg
r,0,0,0
. (53)
10D. The 4-velocity of the moving observer on the geodesic
In order to distinguish a moving observer from an observer at rest , we express the 4-
velocity of the moving observer with a bar (¯), as ¯ uµ. If the observer is moving in the
gravitational ﬁeld without any other force except gravity, it obey s the geodesic equation
Eq. (9). Again, we may consider the trajectory to be conﬁned to the equ atorial plane.
Then,
x2=θ=π
2, (54)
¯u2=dx2
dτ= 0, (55)
and the following conserved quantities are immediately obtained from Eq. (9)
¯u0= const. ≡ −ǫ,∴¯u0=ǫ

¯u3= const. ≡ℓ,∴¯u3=ℓ

As the initial condition, we impose ¯ u1= 0 atr=ri. Then,

Therefore, the 4-velocity ¯ uµof the moving observer on the radial geodesic is

Diﬀerentiating it with r, we obtain

3. The 4-velocity of the moving observer on the non-circular g eodesic
For non-circular motion, the geodesic equation cannot be solved an alytically. As long
as the geodesic motion is on the bound orbit, however, there must b e the maximum and
minimum values of r,rmaxandrminat the points ofdr

12For later use, we solve these equations with respect to ǫup to the linear order of rg:

4a, (72)
where
a≡rmax+rmin
2(73)
corresponds to the semi-major axis in the Newtonian theory.
E. The gravitational redshift (or blueshift)
Consider a light source at r=r1and an observer at r=r2. Both source and observer
are at rest. The source emits light denoted by kµatr1, and it is received by the observer at
rest atr=r2. Using Eqs. ( 52) and (53), the frequency at the source is
ω1=−kµ(r1)uµ(r1) =ωc/radicalBig
1−rg

The frequency of the same light denoted by kµ, received at r=r2by the observer at rest, is
ω2=−kµ(r2)uµ(r2) =ωc/radicalBig
1−rg

The ratio is

Both source and observer are at rest, and there is no relative mot ion. Still, the observed
frequency at r=r2is diﬀerent from that of the source at r=r1. Forrg< r1< r2, the
observed frequency is smaller and it is called the gravitational redsh ift. On the other hand,
forrg< r2< r1, it is called the gravitational blueshift.
F. The Doppler eﬀect due to moving observer on the radial geodesic
Here we consider the case of the observer approaching to the sou rce. Consider a light
source at rest at r=r1. The source emits light radially outward denoted by kµatr1, and
it is received by the observer in radial geodesic motion with ¯ uµatr=r2> r1.
13From Eq. ( 52),kµfor outgoing light is

G. The Doppler eﬀect due to the moving source on the radial geodesic
Here we consider the case of the source moving away from the obse rver. Consider two
sources. One is at rest at r=r1and the emitted light is denoted by kµof (77). The other is
moving with 4-velocity of Eq. ( 61) away from the observer, and emits light outward which
is denoted by k′

Let us consider two light sources. One is at rest at r=r1and emits light radially with
kµof Eq. (77). The other is in circular geodesic motion of radius r1with 4-velocity ¯ uµof
Eq. (67), and it also emits light with ¯kµof Eq. (83). The frequencies at r=r1in the source
15rest frames are

We assume the two frequencies are the same at r=r1. Then,

The observer at rest at r=r2receives the lights. For the sake of simplicity, here we only
consider the case r1< r2. The observed frequencies are

The ratio is divided into two parts. The ﬁrst part is the gravitational redshift as usual. For
the observer at rest, the direction of the source’s circular motion eµis perpendicular to the
radial direction of the emitted light γµ, hence cos ϑ= 0. Therefore, the second part can be
regarded as the transverse Doppler eﬀect due to the moving sour ce.
16I. Compatibility with the Doppler formula
We have already derived the general formula for the Doppler eﬀect in Sec.IIGfor the
relative velocity Vbetween the source and the observer. On the other hand, we hav e used
the solutions of the geodesic equation in this section. Then the freq uencies are expressed
as the functions of r, andVdoes not appear explicitly. Here we examine the compatibility
with the Doppler formula and the results obtained in the above Sec. IIIF-IIIH.
1. The cases of the longitudinal Doppler eﬀect
The Doppler term for the the observer approaching radially to the s ource at r=r2is
derived in Eq. ( 81):

the longitudinal Doppler eﬀect Eq. ( 104) is compatible with the Doppler formula Eq. ( 105).

IV. THE TIME DILATION IN THE SCHWARZSCHILD SPACETIME
A. The gravitational time dilation
Consider two clocks at rest at diﬀerent positions in the gravitationa l ﬁeld. The elapsed
time∆Tof clock is deﬁned to be inversely proportional to the frequency ωof a particular
light or electromagnetic wave observed in the clock’s rest frame:
∆T∝1
ω. (113)
Then, the ratio of the elapsed times of the clocks at rest at r1, andr2is
∆T1
∆T2=ω2
ω1=/radicalBig
1−rg
r1/radicalBig
1−rg
r2. (114)
Therefore, ∆T1< ∆T 2forrg< r1< r2. Clocks in the strong gravitational gravitational
ﬁeld (i.e., near the strong gravitational source) tick slowly. This is ca lled the gravitational
time dilation.
B. The kinetic time dilation
Consider two clocks at the same point in the gravitational ﬁeld. Assu me that clock Ais
at rest with uµand ticks ∆T, and the other clock Bis moving with ¯ uµof Eq. (11) relative
to clockA, ticking ∆¯T.
18As is explained in Appendix B2, the ratio of the elapsed times is

∆¯T < ∆T. Clocks in motion tick slowly. This is called the kinetic time dilation .
C. Time dilation of the moving clock on the radial orbit
Assume that clock Ais at rest at r=riand ticking ∆Ti, and clock Bis moving on the
radial geodesic with the initial condition u1= 0 atr=ri, ticking ∆¯Tatr. The ratio of the

seems nothing new. However, we would like to point out that this equa tion exactly holds
without approximation in general relativity. Just for reference, a conventional derivation
based on the Newtonian analogy is given in Appendix C.
19E. Time dilation of the moving clock on the elliptical orbit
Assume that clock Ais at rest at r=r1and ticking ∆T1, and clock Bis moving on the
non-circular bound orbit, ticking ∆¯Tatrchanging from time to time. The Lorentz factor
is

For non-circular motion, the geodesic equation cannot be solved an alytically. Using
Eq. (72), the following expression is valid up to the linear order of rg:

For non-circular bound orbits, rchanges from time to time. Up to the linear order of rg,
however, we can treat ras the elliptical orbit. Then, the time average of the elliptical orbit
per cycle is/angbracketleftbigg1

which is valid up to the linear order of rg. The time dilation of the moving clock on elliptical
orbit, after averaging per cycle, depends only on the semi-major a xis, irrespective of the
20eccentricity. It is also quite impressive to compare this result Eq. ( 129) with Eq. ( 121).
Replacing the circular radius rin Eq. (121) with the semi-major axis areproduces the
result Eq. ( 129).
V. THE COSMOLOGICAL REDSHIFT AND THE DOPPLER EFFECT IN THE
EXPANDING UNIVERSE
A. The metric of the expanding universe
The Friedmann-Lemaˆ ıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric which describes the expand-

andkis the curvature constant of the homogeneous and isotropic spac e.
B. The solution of the null geodesic equation
Although the metric depends on x0=η, we can show k0is constant:
dk0
dv=1
2gαβ,0kαkβ=1
ada
dηgαβkαkβ= 0, (132)
∴k0= const. ≡ −ωc, (133)
where the null condition gαβkαkβ= 0 is used.
Because of the homogeneous and isotropic property of the FLRW u niverse, it is suﬃcient
to consider radially propagating null geodesics. Then, k2=k3= 0, and the null condition
provides the relation k1=±k0. Finally, kµfor the radially propagating light in the FLRW
universe is
kµ= (−ωc,±ωc,0,0). (134)
21C. The 4-velocity of the comoving observer
The spatial components of the comoving observer’s 4-velocity van ish,ui= 0 by the
deﬁnition. Using the condition uµuµ=−1, we obtain
uµ=/parenleftbigg1
a,0,0,0/parenrightbigg
. (135)
D. The 4-velocity of the moving observer with peculiar velocity
The4-velocityofthemoving observer ¯ uµwithpeculiarvelocity Vrelative tothecomoving
observer is expressed by Eq. ( 11) or Eq. ( 14).
E. The cosmological redshift
The frequency of light ωobserved by the comoving observer is, from Eqs. ( 134) and (135),
ω≡ −kµuµ=ωc
a, (136)
which depends only on the time through the scale factor a(η). The redshift zEq. (28) is
1+z=ωsource
ωobserver=aobserver
asource>1. (137)
This is the well-known formula for the cosmological redshift.
F. The Doppler eﬀect due to the moving observer
The redshift ¯ zmeasured by the moving observer with ¯ uµis, with the help of Eq. ( 36),
1+ ¯z=ωsource
¯ωobserver(138)
=ωsource

where, as explained in Sec. IIG,¯ϑis the angle of incidence in the moving observer’s rest
frame. The dipole anisotropy, which is proportional to cos ¯ϑ, naturally appears as the
Doppler eﬀect due to the observer’s peculiar motion. Note that the amplitude for the
22longitudinal Doppler eﬀect when ¯ϑ= 0 isV/√
1−V2. We also observe the transverse
Doppler eﬀect
1+ ¯z= (1+z)·1√

G. The anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background by the Doppler eﬀect
Let us express the temperature of the cosmic microwave backgro und (CMB) at the re-
combination epoch as Tγ, and those observed by the observer at rest and by the moving
observer as Tγ0and¯Tγ0, respectively. Then,
1+z=Tγ

From Eq. ( 140), we obtain
¯Tγ0=Tγ0√
1−V2

where¯ϑis the angle between the direction of the observer’s velocity and the incoming CMB,
in the moving observer’s frame. (See also Weinberg (1972)11and Weinberg (2008)12.) The
Taylor expansion of Eq. ( 143) in powers of Vgives

Although the amplitudes are small (because |V| ≪1), higher order terms naturally includes
the kinematic quadrupole component caused by the Doppler eﬀect.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have presented a uniﬁed treatment of the gravitational and co smological redshift, the
Dopplereﬀectduetothemovingobserver orsource, andthetimed ilationinthegravitational
ﬁeld in the framework of general relativity.
We have applied it to the cases of moving observer or light source in th e gravitational
ﬁeld, and obtained the Doppler eﬀect formula with the velocity Vof the observer or the
source, in addition to the standard gravitational or cosmological r edshift. In particular, the
longitudinal and the transverse Doppler eﬀects have explicitly been given which hold for
the moving observer or light source in the gravitational ﬁeld describ ed by the Schwarzschild
metric.
23We have also examined the time dilation of the moving clock in the gravita tional ﬁeld.

We have applied our uniﬁed treatment to the cosmological redshift a nd obtained the
Doppler eﬀect formulae which exactly hold in the general relativistic f ramework. We have
observed the existence of the transverse Doppler eﬀect due to t he observer’s peculiar motion
in the expanding universe.
Needless to say, the uniﬁed treatment presented in this paper can also be applied to the
special relativistic cases. It means that the special relativistic eﬀe cts can also be understood
without the Lorentz transformation, which are summarized in Appe ndixBfor reader’s
convenience.
Appendix A: A proof of the composition rule of 4-velocities
Consider two observers AandB, whose 4-velocities are uµand ¯uµrespectively, are at
the same point Pin the spacetime and the observer Bmoves away from the observer A
with relative velocity V. Under a suitable coordinate transformation, we can always take
the local frame which is momentarily comoving with observer Aat the given point P. In
this coordinate system,
uµ=dxµ
dτ= (1,0,0,0). (A1)
Assume that the observer Bmoves in the xdirection with velocity V. Then,

where the unit space-like vector eµ= (0,1,0,0) represents the direction of motion of the
observer Bin the observer A’s rest frame, and satisﬁes eµeµ= 1, eµuµ= 0. Since Eq. ( A6)
is the vector equation, it turns out to hold in any coordinate system s in any spacetime, in
general relativity as well as in special relativity.
Appendix B: Understanding the special relativistic eﬀects without the Lorentz
transformation
The basic principles and equations presented in this paper hold also in s pecial relativistic
situations. All we have to do is just gµν⇒ηµν. Using the results presented in this paper,
we can understand special relativistic eﬀects in the general relativ istic framework, without
using the Lorentz transformation. Just for readers’ convenien ce, we gather related equations
in this Appendix.
1. Observers’ 4-velocities and the composition rule
For the sake of simplicity, we state observer Awith 4-velocity uµis “at rest” and observer
Bwith 4-velocity ¯ uµis “moving” with relative velocity V. The relation between uµand ¯uµ
is presented as the composition rule of 4-velocities in Sec. IIC. Here we gather the related
25equations Eqs. ( 11), (14), (17), (18), and list again in the following:
¯uµ=uµ+Veµ
√
1−V2, (B1)
¯eµ=eµ+Vuµ
√
1−V2, (B2)
uµ=¯uµ−V¯eµ
√
1−V2, (B3)
eµ=¯eµ−V¯uµ
√
1−V2, (B4)
where the unit space-like vector eµrepresents the direction of motion of the observer Bin
the observer A’s rest frame, ¯ eµrepresents the direction of motion of the observer Ain the
observer B’s rest frame. Actually, Eq. ( B3) shows that observer Amoves in the direction
−¯eµwith relative velocity Vin the observer B’s rest frame.
Note that these relations do not represent any coordinate trans formations even if they
somewhat look similar to the Lorentz transformation. They just re present that some 4-
vectors are expressed by the linear combinations of other 4-vect ors at the same point in
the spacetime. Since they are vector equations, they hold in any co ordinate systems in any
spacetime, including the Minkowski spacetime in special relativity.
2. Time dilation
Consider a clock moving with 4-velocity ¯ uµ. The 4-vector
tµ≡∆T0¯uµ(B5)
represents that ∆T0elapses in the clock’s rest frame. If the observer at rest with 4-ve locity
uµmeasures this in the observer’s rest frame, the elapsed time ∆Tis
∆T≡ −tµuµ=−∆T0¯uµuµ=∆T0√
1−V2, (B6)
where we have used Eq. ( 19). Hence,
∆T0=∆T√
1−V2< ∆T . (B7)
The elapsed time of the moving clock ∆T0is shorter than that of the clock at rest ∆T.
Clocks in motion tick slowly. This is the kinetic time dilation. It may be ofte n called the
special relativistic time dilation. However, it is also valid in general relat ivity, because it is
derived in covariant way without using the Lorentz transformation .
263. Lorentz contraction
Suppose that a perfectly rigid rod is placed parallel to the direction eµand moving with
4-velocity ¯ uµ. Observer Aat rest measures the length of the moving rod and obtain the
value ofLinA’s rest frame. The 4-vector
ℓµ≡Leµ(B8)
represents this fact. On the other hand, the “proper” length L0measured in the rod’s rest
frame is
L0≡ℓµ¯eµ=Leµ¯eµ=L√
1−V2, (B9)
where we have used Eq. ( 19). Hence,
L=L0√
1−V2< L0. (B10)
The length Lof the moving rod is shorter than the “proper” length L0measured in the
rod’s rest frame. Rods in motion contract. This is known as the Lore ntz contraction.
4. Composition law of 3-dimensional velocities
We already assumed that observer Awith 4-velocity uµis “at rest” and observer Bwith
4-velocity ¯ uµis “moving” with relative velocity V. Furthermore, let us assume that observer
Cis moving with 4-velocity ˜ uµfromBwith relative velocity W. Then,
˜uµ=¯uµ+W¯eµ
√
1−W2. (B11)
Using Eqs. ( B1), (B2), (B11), and eliminating ¯ uµand ¯eµ, we obtain
˜uµ=uµ+Ueµ
√
1−U2, (B12)
where
U≡V+W
1+VW. (B13)
This means that observer Cis moving from Awith relative velocity Uof Eq. (B13). This
is well known as the composition law of 3-dimensional velocities.

frequency measured by moving observer B,ϑis the angle of incidence in observer A’s rest
frame, and ¯ϑrepresents the angle of incidence in observer B’s rest frame. We do not need
the Lorentz transformation to derive these formulae.
6. Transformation of the electromagnetic ﬁelds
Let us deﬁne the electromagnetic tensor
Fµν≡∂µAν−∂νAµ, (B17)
and it’s dual tensor
∗Fµν≡1
2εµναβFαβ, (B18)
whereεµναβis the Levi-Civita complete antisymmetric tensor.
Once the electromagnetic tensor is given, the electric and the magn etic (magnetic ﬂux
density) ﬁeld vectors for observer Aare
Eµ≡Fµνuν, (B19)
Bν≡∗Fµνuµ. (B20)
Both are spacelike in the sense Eµuµ=Bνuν= 0.
We introduce the unit spacelike vector nµwhich satisﬁes uµnµ= 0,eµnµ= 0,nµnµ= 1.
Note that nµalso satisﬁes ¯ uµnµ= 0,¯eµnµ= 0, which can be easily proven using Eqs. ( B1)
and (B2). Therefore, the spacelike vector nµis “perpendicular” to both eµand ¯eµ.
28Usingeµandnµ, we deﬁne the “parallel” and the “perpendicular” components of th e
electromagnetic ﬁeld vectors as follows:
E//≡eµEµ=eµFµνuν, (B21)
E⊥≡nµEµ=nµFµνuν, (B22)
B//≡eνBν=eν∗Fµνuµ, (B23)
B⊥≡nνBν=nν∗Fµνuµ. (B24)

7See Eqs. (6 .5a),(6.9) of Ellis4. It is originally written as
kaka= 0,
ka;bkb= 0.
8See Eq. (6 .11a) of Ellis4. It is originally written as
ua= coshβua+ sinhβea, eaea= 1, eaua= 0,..., andV= tghβis the velocity of
relative motion. (The same uaappears in the both sides. It might be a typo. )

ka= (−ubkb)(ua+na), naba= 1, naua= 0.

11Eq. (15.5.24) of S. Weinberg, Gravitation and Cosmology (John Wily & Sons, New York, 1972).
It is originally written as
31T′
γ0≡/parenleftbiggν′
ν/parenrightbigg
Tγ0= [1−v2
⊕]−1/2[1−v⊕cosθ]Tγ0,
where cos θ≡γµeµin our notation.
12Eq. (2.4.6) of S. Weinberg, Cosmology (Oxford University Press, New York, 2008). It is origi-
nally written as
T′=T
γ(1+βcosθ),
where cos θshould be read as cos ¯θ≡¯γµ¯eµin our notation. Eq. ( 143) in our paper is equivalent
to this Eq. (2.4.6) of Weinberg (2008) because ¯θ=π−¯ϑ. The equivalence of Eq. (15.5.24) of
Weinberg (1972) and this Eq. (2.4.6) of Weinberg (2008) can b e shown using the aberration
formula which relates cos θto cos¯θ.
