In the aspect of longitudinal beam bunching, the bunching strength can be controlled by the RF
cavity phase and voltage. However, these machine parameters are different from those that interact
with the beam itself. In order to gain control of the beam-cavity interaction, cavity calibration
must be performed. Furthermore, it relies on fitting the beam energy gain versus cavity phase
to a calibration function. Under the conventional assumption of relativistic beam conditions, the
calibration function is a first harmonic sinusoidal function (a sinusoidal function with a period of 2 π).
However, this expression is insufficient for a high-voltage bunching cavity. Due to beam acceleration
inside the cavity, an energy bias and a second harmonic function should be included to modify the
conventional calibration function, even for a relativistic electron beam. In this paper, we will derive
this modification and provide a comparison to both the Coherent Electron Cooling Experiment and
the IMPACT-T simulation, respectively.
I. INTRODUCTION
A single-cell RF cavity often serves as a bunching cav-
ity for low-energy beamline. In normal design, the bunch-
ing cavity frequency, denoted by f, is matched with the
incoming beam velocity, such that f=β0c/L, where L
is the cavity length. This matching condition allows the
incoming beam to “surf” on a chosen phase angle of the
cavity field. By adjusting the cavity voltage, a desig-
nated energy chirp can be introduced to the incoming
beam. This energy chirp creates a head-to-tail veloc-
ity difference in the beam, causing longitudinal bunching
(velocity bunching). Consequently, the target beam cur-
rent profile can be manipulated by the input phase angle
and voltage of the bunching cavity.
However, due to the nature of the RF system, the ma-
chine input phase parameters θare different from the
phase angle of the electric field that the beam is surfing
on. It requires calibration to determine cavity parame-
ters, such as the Transit Time Factor (TTF) and the RF
phase reference. During calibration, we measure a cal-
ibration function, which is defined as the beam energy
gain ∆ Uafter the cavity at different input cavity phases
θ, shown in Eq. (1). Here, ⃗Edenotes the cavity electric
field and ⃗ υdenotes the beam velocity.
For relativistic electrons, the effect of velocity change
inside the RF cavity is conventionally ignored, leading
to the widely accepted first-order calibration function
C(1)(θ), given by Eq. (2). Here, V0denotes the cavity
voltage, while αandµ0denote the TTF and the RF
phase reference, respectively.

However, Eq. (2) is insufficient for high-voltage RF
cavities, such as the single-cell 500MHz bunching cav-
ity used in the Coherent Electron Cooling (CeC) Proof
of Principle (PoP) Experiment [1, 2]. Figure 1 shows the
CeC low-energy beam transport (LEBT) section, where
the electron bunches ( ∼1.5 nC, ∼380 ps) are generated
in the 113MHz quarter-wave superconducting RF (SRF)
photoinjector [3, 4], which provides a primary accelera-
tion of 1.25MeV. Before the beam reaches the 704 MHz
SRF 5-cell linac for the final energy boost of 13.1 MeV,
the desired beam peak current is achieved by means of
longitudinal bunching. The required compression is ob-
tained through the use of a normal-conducting 500 MHz
FIG. 1. The schematic of the CeC low-energy transportation
beamline. The main goal of this section is to prepare a high-
quality electron beam for coherent cooling. Currently, only
one 500 MHz bunching cavity is in operation.arXiv:2305.19900v1  [physics.acc-ph]  31 May 20232
bunching cavity [5] ( L= 0.57 m) that is operated at 185
kV, providing ∼20 times the bunch length compression
in a drifting course of 10 meters.
During cavity calibration, both through experiment
and simulations (using IMPACT-T [6]), for the CeC rel-
ativistic electron beam, we observed significant devia-
tion from the conventional calibration function shown in
Eq. (2). For example, the bunching phase reference can
shift from ∼0.2 to 0.5 degrees for the setting of ∼100 kV
to 200 kV bunching voltage. These deviations strongly
affected our machine optimization for beam emittance
and peak current control. A higher-order correction in
the beam-cavity interaction is needed to achieve control-
lable beam instability.
While the higher-order correction in the beam-cavity
interaction was realized and derived in the late 1980s
for low-velocity ions under Newtonian mechanics [7, 8],
it is currently unclear whether this effect has been sys-
tematically measured and studied for relativistic electron
beams. Although it is possible that this problem has been
observed and addressed in other electron linacs, to our
knowledge, no comprehensive study or model has been
developed for correcting this effect beyond the first-order
formula in the case of relativistic electron beams. In
the following sections, we will derive the second-order
correction to the calibration function using an alterna-
tive approach. By expanding the phase-space parame-
ters of the traveling beam in terms of energy gain, we
arrived at a relativistic version of the modified calibra-
tion function with corrections (compared with the result
in Refs. [7]). We will show detailed derivation steps in
the appendix sections. Furthermore, we will provide a
direct comparison of the theoretical model with experi-
mental measurement, IMPACT-T simulation results, and
the non-relativistic model of Refs. [7].
II. THEORETICAL MODEL
To solve Eq. (1), we expand both the beam velocity
υ(t, θ) and the distance traveled by the beam z(t, θ)
with respect to the change in beam energy caused by
the bunching cavity, ∆ U(t, θ), as shown in Eq. (3). Fur-
thermore, we use the Fourier form of Ezin Eq. (4) to
represent an arbitrary RF cavity field, where akandϕk
are the Fourier coefficients.

mately 1% of their leading order terms.
A. First Order Calibration Function
Under the assumption of low bunching voltage for a
relativistic incoming beam, only the first order of υand
zis kept for the buncher calculation, shown in Eq. (5).
As a result, at any given time t, the beam energy gain
can be written as Eq. (6), where ευandτυare functions
of time t. If we set the time equal to L/β 0c, we obtain
the conventional calibration function shown in Eq. (2).
υ(1)(t, θ) =β0c
z(1)(t, θ) =β0ct(5)
∆U(1)(t, θ) =γ3
0mβ 0cευ(t) cos [ θ−τυ(t)] (6)
B. Second Order Calibration Function
On the other hand, at high bunching voltage, the cal-
ibration function should include beam acceleration. By
substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (3), we obtain the second-
order correction of beam velocity and beam distance trav-
eled for an accelerating beam characterized by two time
functions ευ(t) and εz(t), shown in Eq. (7).
υ(2)(t, θ) =ευ(t) cos ( θ−τυ(t))
z(2)(t, θ) =εz(t) cos ( θ−τz(t))(7)
∆U(2)(t, θ) =δ0(t) +δ1(t) cos (2 θ−τv2(t)) (8)3
In general, εzandευare smaller than their leading-
order parameters Landβ0cat any given location inside
the bunching cavity, as shown in Fig.2. Therefore, we
expand the integral in Eq. (1) up to the first order of
εzandευwithout losing generality. After the approx-
imation, we obtain an expression for the second-order
correction in beam energy gain ∆ U(2), shown in Eq. (8).
Where the newly appeared time functions δ0(t) and δ1(t)
in this equation are also independent of the phase angle
θ. Unlike the form of ∆ U(1), ∆U(2)has no first har-
monic function term, e.g., cos( θ−µ), but has a bias term
and a second harmonic function. Both terms are sup-
pressed by the factorq2V2

0P0cat the end of the bunching
cavity (when t=L/β 0c), where P0is the initial beam

the calibration function has a quadratic dependence on
the bunching voltage. This result is consistent with the
second-order longitudinal transit time factor derived in
Refs. [7] for slow-moving ions ( βbelow 0.1), which did
not take the relativistic effect into account.

Lastly, Eq. (9) shows the modified calibration function,
where σ0andσ1are dimensionless parameters related to
the cavity field structure. In a setup with relatively high
bunching voltage, the bias term in Eq. (9) can cause a
significant shift in beam energy. If the conventional cal-
ibration function is used, this energy shift may be in-
correctly interpreted as an increase in the initial beam
energy. Additionally, the reference phase θ0(phase of
zero beam energy gain) is also shifted from the conven-
tional RF phase reference µ0due to the effect of beam
acceleration. This phase shift has a rough linear relation
with the bunching voltage, as shown in Eq. (10). Con-
sequently, using only Eq. (2) to calibrate a high voltage
bunching cavity can compromise the accuracy of beam
dynamics calculations.
III. SIMULATION COMPARISON
To verify our modification, we compared Eq. (9) and
Eq. (10) with a CeC IMPACT-T simulation model [9].
During the simulation, we propagated the CeC electron
beam through a 500 MHz bunching cavity with variant
voltage, ranging from 8 kV to 360 kV (initial beam en-
ergy is 1.25 MeV), and recorded the exiting beam en-
ergy. At each bunching cavity voltage, we scanned a
complete 2 πcavity phase in 160 steps to obtain a single
FIG. 3. The comparison between IMPACT-T simulation
(black dots) and theoretical model (red line) of the CeC 1.25
MeV electron beam is shown in the following three plots: (a)
compares the bias term in Eq. (9); (b) compares the second
harmonic term in Eq. (9) and result calculated by means of
Refs. [7] (blue line); and (c) compares the zero energy gain
phase θ0, which is often used as a reference phase during
bunching cavity calibration.
calibration function. These simulated calibration func-
tions were then individually fitted with a general func-
tion, e.g., C(θ) =A+Bsin(θ+a) +Csin(2θ+b). We
plotted all the fitting constants Aagainst their bunching
voltage in Fig.3(a), together with the theoretical expres-
sion of the bias term shown in Eq. (9) for comparison.4
Figure 3(b) shows a comparison of the second-order
harmonic term obtained from our modified calibration
function and the formula from Refs. [7], which without
considering the relativistic effects. Notably, our modi-
fied calibration function with the relativistic correction
term shows much better agreement with the IMPACT-T
simulated data. This clearly demonstrates the signifi-
cance of our proposed modification. We also compared
the phase shift obtained from our modified calibration
function with the simulated results, as shown in Fig.3(c).
Overall, the IMPACT-T simulation of the CeC experi-
ment matched well with our modified calibration func-
tion.
However, one may notice some discrepancies in both
Fig.3(a) and Fig.3(b). These discrepancies are the result
of the contribution of higher-order corrections (e.g., the
third-order correction), which are outside the scope of
this paper and the current CeC experiment.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON
Moreover, we also observed similar deviations in the
calibration function during the CeC experiment. Figure 4
shows the data from a complete calibration of the CeC
500 MHz bunching cavity. Each point of U(θ) on Fig. 4
was obtained by a single CeC beam energy measurement
individually, using the downstream trims, solenoid, and
YAG screen [10, 11]. In this particular calibration, the
initial CeC electron beam energy was 0.75 MeV, and the
bunching cavity was set to around 190 kV. After sub-
tracting the bias and first harmonic component from the
measurement data, we obtained the higher-order compo-
nents (dominated by the second-order harmonic) of the
calibration function. The comparison of the subtracted
result, the theoretical prediction from Eq.(9), and the
formula of Refs. [7] is shown in Fig.5. The measure-
ment data exhibited a good match in terms of ampli-
tude and frequency with our theoretical prediction. How-
ever, the formula of Refs. [7] showed a significant discrep-
ancy, which is mainly attributed to the lack of relativis-
tic gamma factor suppression in Newtonian mechanics.
This causes an overestimation of the effect in the case of
a relativistic electron beam, such as the one in the CeC
accelerator.
However, a phase-dependent discrepancy between the
experimental measurement and our theoretical model can
also be identified from Fig.5. This small discrepancy can
be caused by even higher-order corrections (such as the
third-order harmonic) of the calibration function, convo-
luted with machine errors. The most common machine
errors are beam energy fluctuations and time jitter of
the RF system (for the CeC beam, ∼ ± 10 ps jitter and
∼ ± 0.1 keV energy fluctuations). Isolating the effect
of higher-order correction is challenging since each single
energy measurement requires at least 32 CeC electron
beam bunches to reach the desired measurement accu-
racy. Fig.5 contains a total of 1280 measurements of in-

measured downstream with different phase angle settings θ.

order fitting using Eq. (2) is displayed as the red line.

hours. To measure only the effect of higher-order cali-
bration functions requires extremely high stability from
the CeC machine.
V. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the acceleration inside the bunching cav-
ity induces a secondary correction to the conventional
calibration function, which is significant even for rela-
tivistic electron beams. This correction creates an addi-
tional energy bias and adds a second harmonic function
to the conventional calibration function. Both additional
terms have a quadratic dependence on the bunching volt-
age. Additionally, these corrections induce a linear phase5
shift to the reference phase of the conventional calibra-
tion function, which can affect downstream beam dynam-
ics, including emittance and peak current.
Notably, the formula of Refs. [7], developed for low-
velocity beams, overestimates the corrections for our in-
termediate energy beams. This finding emphasizes the
significance of our proposed modification, which takes
into account the relativistic effects and provides a more
accurate calibration function for high-voltage bunching
systems. In the example of the CeC 500 MHz bunching
cavity, which operates at a voltage of 185 kV, the electron
beam with an initial energy of 1.25 MeV will be shifted
by a 1.6 keV energy bias after the bunching cavity. Fur-
thermore, the reference phase of the cavity will also be
shifted by 0.46 degrees. These modifications improve the
accuracy of the downstream beam dynamics control and
are crucial for optimizing the performance of relativistic
electron beams in various applications.

APPENDIX
It is well known that the first-order cavity calibration
function is a first harmonic function of the cavity phase
θ, causing the second-order beam velocity to also be a
first harmonic function. Therefore, it is convenient to
express our physical quantities on the odd-even Fourier
basis to derive the higher-order beam energy gain (en-
ergy operators in tandθare separated). The electric
field can be expressed as a rotation operator in time and
upping and lowering operator in θ. Equation (11) and
Eq. (12) show the expression of the beam velocity and
beam energy gain.
