Theoretically, solutions of the damped harmonic oscillator asymptotically approach equilibrium, i.e., the zero energy
state, without ever reaching it exactly, and the critically damped solution approaches equilibrium faster than the under-
damped or the overdamped solution. Experimentally, the systems described with this model reach equilibrium when
the system’s energy has dropped below some threshold corresponding to the energy resolution of the measuring appa-
ratus. We show that one can (almost) always find an optimal underdamped solution that will reach this energy threshold
sooner than all other underdamped solutions, as well as the critically damped solution, no matter how small this thresh-
old is. We also comment on one exception to this for a particular type of initial conditions, when a specific overdamped
solution reaches the equilibrium state sooner than all other solutions. We confirm some of our findings experimentally.
I. INTRODUCTION
Under which conditions does the damped harmonic oscil-
lator return to the equilibrium state the fastest? Standard text-
books answer that the oscillator returns to the equilibrium
state the fastest in the critically damped regime, regardless
of the initial conditions1–5. Since none of the solutions to
this model ever exactly reach the equilibrium state, but only
asymptotically approach it, textbook authors usually justify
this answer by considering the convergence speed of the gen-
eral underdamped, critically damped and overdamped solu-
tions towards the equilibrium state in the infinite time limit1.
Indeed, in that asymptotic sense, the critically damped solu-
tion approaches the equilibrium state faster than the others.
The situation becomes more subtle when experimental reso-
lution is taken into account; one can determine the damping
coefficient in the underdamped regime for which the oscilla-
tor settles down fastest to equilibrium by setting the maximal
overshoot to be equal to the displacement resolution6. Simi-
larly, Heald7sets the minimum detectable overshoot equal to
the displacement resolution and computes the degree of under-
damping that would be mistaken for critical due to the fastest
return to the equilibrium.
In this paper we theoretically find the time interval dur-
ing which the envelope of the underdamped displacement is
smaller in magnitude than the displacement of a critically
damped oscillator using the Lambert W function8. Depend-
ing on the damping coefficient, we determine the instant at
which the envelope of underdamped displacement becomes
larger than the displacement of the critically damped oscilla-
tor. We find that displacements at and after that moment are
experimentally practically immeasurable for damping coeffi-
cients that are well within the underdamped regime, e.g. 10%
smaller than the critical damping coefficient.
In the ideal case, the equilibrium state is the zero energy
state, with both the displacement and the velocity equal to
zero, here we define the equilibrium state as the state in which
the energy of the oscillator has dropped to a certain (infinites-
imal) fraction of the initial energy, e.g. below a given experi-
mental energy resolution. We show that it is possible to findan optimal damping coefficient in the underdamped regime
for which the system’s energy will fall below this predeter-
mined threshold sooner than for any other underdamped, crit-
ically damped or overdamped oscillators with the same initial
conditions. An exception to this is a special set of initial con-
ditions for which an overdamped oscillator reaches the equi-
librium state sooner than all others, regardless of whether we
define the equilibrium state as a zero energy state or as a state
with some infinitesimal fraction of initial energy. To check
our statements experimentally, we designed an RLC circuit
with variable parameters and measured the oscillating voltage
across the resistor using a standard laboratory oscilloscope.
The measurements are consistent with the theoretical findings.
II. SHORT REVIEW OF THE MODEL
The differential equation of the damped harmonic oscillator
is of the form
¨x(t)+2γ˙x(t)+ω2
0x(t) =0, (1)
where x(t)denotes the displacement from the equilibrium po-
sition as a function of time, the dots denote time derivatives,
γ>0 is the damping coefficient and ω0stands for the un-
damped oscillator angular frequency (the oscillator’s natural
frequency). The zero energy state of the system is achieved
when both x=0 and ˙ x=0. The form of the solution to the
equation (1) depends on the relationship between γandω0,
producing three possible regimes.
Forγ<ω0the system is in the underdamped regime with
the solution

ditions x0≡x(0)andv0≡˙x(0). The displacement oscillates
quasiperiodically within an exponentially decaying envelope
given by
A(t) =Ae−γt=r

0+(v0+γx0)2
ω2e−γt. (3)
We want to emphasize here that the displacement maxima are
not tangent to the envelope and it could be misleading to refer
to the function (3) as the time dependent amplitude9. It is easy
to check that the envelope of the velocity, ˙ xud(t), behaves sim-
ilarly, and thus the system asymptotically approaches equilib-
rium.
Forγ=ω0the system is in the critically damped regime
with the solution
xc(t) = ( x0+(v0+ω0x0)t)e−ω0t. (4)
The solution approaches equilibrium without oscillating.
Forγ>ω0the system is in the overdamped regime with the
solution

(5)
where α=q

0. As in the critically damped regime, the
solution approaches equilibrium without oscillating.
The envelope of the underdamped oscillations decays as
e−γt, and thus to compare the decays of the underdamped and
critically damped solutions, we examine the ratio
lim
t→∞xc(t)
e−γt=lim
t→∞(x0+(v0+ω0x0)t)e−(ω0−γ)t=0, (6)
since ω0>γ. Therefore, the critically damped solution ap-
proaches equilibrium faster than the underdamped solution.
For the overdamped regime, the approach to the equilibrium
in the infinite time limit is governed by the slowly decaying
exponential e(−γ+α)t, and thus we evaluate
lim
t→∞xc(t)
e(−γ+α)t=lim
t→∞(x0+(v0+ω0x0)t)e−(ω0−γ+α)t=0,
(7)
due to ω0−γ+α>0. Again, the critically damped solution
approaches the equilibrium faster than the overdamped one.
The last statement is not completely general, since there is a
possibility of a special case in which the initial displacement
and velocity are of opposite sign and satisfy |v0|>|x0ω0|. In
this case, it is possible to choose a damping coefficient γsuch
that the factor multiplying the slowly decaying exponential
is zero and only the quickly decaying exponential e(−γ−α)tis
present. In this case, the overdamped oscillator approaches the
equilibrium state faster than the critically damped oscillator
with the same initial conditions.
We now consider the energy of the oscillator. If we multiply
Eq. (1) by ˙ x(t), and rewrite the resulting first and third terms
as time derivatives, we get

first term in the equation (8) is the time derivative of the total
mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) per unit mass and
the second term is the power of the dissipative force per unit
mass. The ratio of the system’s mechanical energy at time tto
its initial mechanical energy is

Here, for later convenience, we define the ratio of the kinetic
to total energy at any given time tas

Note that, in the underdamped case, when βud(t) =1, the sys-
tem is in the equilibrium position and possesses only kinetic
energy. Conversely, when βud(t) =0 the system is at a turning
point, and possesses only potential energy. Using (11), we can
rewrite (10) using the natural logarithm as
d

=−4γβ(t), (12)
since the total energy is strictly real and positive. Equation
(12) is valid for all three oscillating regimes, i.e., for under-
damped, critically damped and overdamped regimes. We find
it especially useful when analyzing the underdamped case on
account of its quasiperiodic motion.
Eqs. (10) and (12) are clearly related, but one must be
aware of their implicit differences. For example, both loss
rates have maxima, equal to zero, at moments when ˙ x(t)2=0
andβ(t) =0, but the minima occur at different times. Com-
pared to the undamped system, the underdamped oscillator
achieves its maximum speed somewhat before it reaches the
equilibrium position10where β(t) =1 . To avoid confusion,
in what follows, we will refer to Eq. (12) as the energy loss
rate.
To summarize, the solutions of the damped harmonic os-
cillator asymptotically approach the equilibrium state, but
never exactly reach it. In that asymptotic sense, the critically
damped oscillator returns to equilibrium the most quickly in
all cases (apart from a specific case of an overdamped oscilla-
tor). In nature and in experiments, systems described by this
model reach an effective equilibrium state in which the en-
ergy of the system has decreased to the level of the surround-
ing noise, or the energy resolution of the measuring apparatus.
Following this line of thought, we will define a system to be
in equilibrium for times t>τsuch that

where δ>0 is a dimensionless parameter that defines what
fraction of the initial energy is left in the system. In the next
section we prove that, for any finite value of δ, one can always
find an optimal solution in the underdamped regime ( γ<ω0)
which will reach equilibrium, in the sense of (13), sooner than
all other underdamped or critically damped solutions with the
same initial conditions.
III. THE FASTEST ROUTE TO EQUILIBRIUM
A. Displacement analysis
We focus on the initial conditions given by x0>0 and
v0=0. The underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped
solutions for this set of initial conditions are:
xud(t) =A(t)cos(ωt+φ),with

. (16)
The critical and overdamped solutions (15) and (16) have no
zeros, and the overdamped solution approaches the equilib-
rium state more slowly. Thus, we can conclude that the over-
damped solution is further from equilibrium than the criti-
cally damped solution, for any t>0 (we rigorously prove
thatxod(t)>xc(t), for any t>0 in supplementary material11,
section SI). Therefore, we exclude the overdamped regime in
what follows. In Fig. 1 we show the envelope A(t), the un-
derdamped solution xud(t)with γ=0.6ω0, and the critically
damped solution xc(t). Let us assume that Fig. 1 models a
real-life experiment in which the displacement resolution is,
e.g.,∆x=±0.1x0(which would be a poor resolution, we take
it here just to set an example). From the point of view of that
experiment, the underdamped solution settles down to equi-
librium sooner than the critically damped solution. By set-
ting the maximal overshoot equal to the displacement resolu-
tion, one can determine the damping coefficient in the under-
damped regime for which the damped oscillator reaches equi-
librium, within experimental resolution, as quickly as possi-
ble, as Armstrong6has already shown. Here, we find the time
interval t∈(τ1,τ2)during which A(t)<xc(t)so that the en-
velope of the underdamped solution xud(t)is actually closer
to the equilibrium than xc(t).
We can gain analytical insight into the relationship between
the underdamped and critically damped solutions by analyz-
ing the dependence of the two crossing times, τ1andτ2, on the
damping coefficient. We equate A(τ1,2) =xc(τ1,2), and get

ing the time interval t∈(τ1,τ2)the envelope of the underdamped
solution xud(t)is closer to the equilibrium than xc(t). The magni-
tude of the displacement in the underdamped case becomes confined
within the band ±0.1x0before the critically damped case and re-
mains within that region for all subsequent times.

tionxud(t)oscillates with an envelope that is smaller in magni-
tude than the critically damped solution, until both solutions
reach a displacement of the order 10−9x0att=τ2. In gen-
eral, since the magnitude of the underdamped solution’s dis-
placement is smaller than the critically damped solution forDamped harmonic oscillator revisited: the fastest route to equilibrium 4
τ1<t<τ2, then if A(τ2)is less than the experimental reso-
lution, the underdamped displacement will not be measured
to be larger than the critically damped displacement at any
time after τ1. Note that τ2diverges as γapproaches ω0, and
therefore A(τ2)can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a
large enough damping coefficient. Therefore, even though the
critically damped displacement approaches equilibrium faster
than the underdamped displacement for t>τ2, for any given
experimental resolution, one can find a damping coefficient γ
for which the underdamped solution will be measured to reach
equilibrium first.

ergy ratio (9) for γ=0.9ω0(red solid curve) and for the critically

The energies of the two systems are equal when t=24.24ω−1
0, as
indicated by an arrow. After this moment, the energy ratio for the
underdamped case oscillates above and below the same ratio for the
critically damped oscillator, until t=43.03ω−1
0(also indicated with
an arrow), after which it always remains above it.
B. Energy analysis
We now turn our attention to the energy of the system. In
Fig. 3 (a) we show the base 10 logarithm of the ratio (9), for
four values of γ={0.85ω0,0.9ω0,0.95ω0,ω0}. The energyratios for various underdamped cases are only slightly larger
than the corresponding ratio for the critically damped oscilla-
tor from t=0 until t={1.10ω−1
0,1.06ω−1
0,1.03ω−1
0}, for
γ={0.85ω0,0.9ω0,0.95ω0}respectively. After these mo-
ments, the underdamped curves remain lower than the crit-
ically damped one for the rest of the time period of Fig.
3(a). In Fig. 3(b) we show the same behavior, this time for
the case when γ=0.9ω0, and during a longer time period.
We note that the energy ratios of the two systems are equal
when t=24.24ω−1
0. This energy ratio equality occurs slightly
later in time than the equality of the underdamped oscillator
envelope and the critically damped oscillator displacement,
(t=τ2=23.81ω−1
0as shown in Sec. III A). We expect that
these times do not coincide due to the differences between
the envelope and the full underdamped solution, i.e., the un-
derdamped displacement exceeds the critical displacement in
magnitude later than the envelope. After t=24.24ω−1
0, the
energy ratio of the underdamped oscillator periodically dips
below that of the critically damped oscillator. Finally, when
t>43.03ω−1
0, which corresponds to E(t)<10−33E0, the en-
ergy ratio of the underdamped oscillator remains permanently
above the energy ratio for the critically damped oscillator, in
accordance with infinite time limit (6). Other values of the
underdamped damping coefficient show the same qualitative
behavior. To determine an optimal damping coefficient γfor
which the system’s energy will drop to a desired energy level
the soonest, we first give an example in Fig. 3(a), where we
draw a horizontal line corresponding to E(t)/E0=10−5.5.
It is immediately clear that the underdamped oscillator with
γ=0.9ω0reaches the line corresponding to E(t)/E0=10−5.5
first, before the other underdamped oscillators.
C. Existence of a unique optimal damping coefficient
Using a particular example, we now show that it is possible
to determine a unique underdamped γfor which the oscillator
reaches some energy level faster than for any other γ. The un-
derdamped oscillator, described by (14), is in the equilibrium
position at moments given by

the energy loss rates (12) of the critically damped oscillator
and underdamped oscillators for γ={0.886ω0,0.9ω0}. For
the case γ=0.9ω0the maximal magnitude of the energy loss
rate is 4 γ=3.6ω0. This means, according to (12), βud=1 at
time τA1=6.17ω−1
0. At this moment, the system first passes
through the equilibrium position. By contrast, the energy loss
rate is zero when βud=0 atτB1=7.21ω−1
0, when the sys-
tem arrives for the first time at a turning point. It is clear thatDamped harmonic oscillator revisited: the fastest route to equilibrium 5

dicates the energy level reached by γ=0.886ω0att=6.17ω−1
0. See
text for details.
γ=0.886ω0(or any other γ<ω0), yields qualitatively the
same behavior.
In Fig. 4(b) we show the energy ratio (9) as a function of γ
att=6.17ω−1
0. At this moment, the oscillator with γ=0.9ω0
reaches the equilibrium position for the first time, and we
can see that the energy ratio has a global minimum for a
slightly smaller damping coefficient, i.e. for γ=0.886ω0.
The value of this energy minimum is 10−5E0. Let’s assume
that this is the energy resolution of the experiment; we de-
note this threshold energy as Eth. We note here that, for any
γ, the energy is a monotonically decreasing function of time.
Thus, E(γ,t)>Ethfort<6.17ω−1
0, and the oscillator with
γ=0.886ω0reaches Ethatt=6.17ω−1
0, faster than oscillators
with any other γ. We can conclude that γ=0.886ω0is the op-
timal damping coefficient for experiment with Eth=10−5E0.
This example shows us that if, at some instant, the energy
as a function of γhas a global minimum at some γmin, theoscillator with γminreaches that energy minimum faster than
all other oscillators, i.e., γminis the optimal damping coeffi-
cient for that energy threshold. In the appendix B we present
the behavior of the energy ratio (9) and its global minimum
for a wider range of γ, and at different instants over a larger
time span. It is clear that for any energy level Eththe unique
optimal damping coefficient can be found.
We note here that the oscillator with optimal damping coef-
ficient reaches Ethwhen its displacement is between the equi-
librium position and the first turning point (designated by the
red circle in Fig. 4(a)). At the same instant, the oscillator with
slightly larger damping coefficient, i.e. with γ=0.9ω0, ar-
rives for the first time at the equilibrium position and has
slightly more energy than the optimally damped oscillator
(see Fig. 4(b)). In appendix B we show that this difference—
between the optimal damping coefficient (for which the en-
ergy ratio (9) has a minimum at some instant) and the damping
coefficient which causes the system to first reach equilibrium
at that same instant—decreases as we move to lower values of
Eth. Therefore, as we show below, if we use (19) to determine
γfor which the system first comes to equilibrium precisely
when its energy is equal to Eth, we have obtained an excellent
first approximation of the optimal damping coefficient and a
good starting point for its precise numerical determination.
D. Determination of the optimal damping coefficient
We define the system to be effectively at equilibrium when
its energy equals 10−δE0, with some δ>0 and we find the
optimal underdamped coefficient γoptin two steps.
First we determine γfor which the system reaches this en-
ergy level when passing through equilibrium for the first time.
We will show that this value of γis an excellent first approx-
imation for the optimal damping coefficient. Therefore, we
will refer to it as the first step optimal damping denoted as γ1.
In the second step, we use γ1to find a small subset of un-
derdamped coefficients for which the system reaches energy
10−δE0faster than the system with γ1, and we then determine
the optimal damping coefficient γoptfrom that subset.
The first step optimal damping coefficient γ1is determined
by the condition E(τA1) =10−δE0. Since at τA1the total en-
ergy is equal to the kinetic energy, we can write the chosen
condition as
Eud(τA1)

TABLE I. The first column contains the ratio E(t)/E0which defines
the effective equilibrium state. The second column gives the first step
optimal underdamped coefficient γ1obtained from (23). The third
column contains the time τA1at which the underdamped oscillator
(with coefficient γ1) has reached the effective equilibrium state. The
fourth column contains the time at which the critically damped oscil-
lator reaches that same level of energy, and the fifth column contains
the relative time advantage of the underdamped oscillator compared
to the critically damped oscillator.
We now proceed to the second step and find the opti-
mal damping coefficient. We focus on the energy resolu-
tion 10−6E0; for any other choice the procedure is the same.
From Table I, we see that the oscillator with γ1=0.9286ω0
reaches this resolution when first at equilibrium position, i.e.,
att=7.44ω−1
0. In Fig. 6 we show the energy ratio (9) as a
function of γat this instant. From this graph we determine the
subset of underdamped coefficients γ∈(0.9104ω0,0.9286ω0)
with energy smaller than 10−6E0at this instant; this is the sub-
set of underdamped coefficients that drop below the experi-
mental energy resolution faster than γ1. Since this subset is0.87 0.89 0.91 0.93 0.9501·10−5

only∆γ=0.0182ω0wide, we determined the optimal damp-
ing coefficient simply by stepping through the values in this
subset and numerically finding the value of γwhich causes
the system’s energy ratio (9) to intersect the level 10−6in the
shortest time. We find that γopt=0.9145ω0reaches the en-
ergy resolution at t=7.20ω−1
0, faster than any other γ. To
confirm this, in Fig. 6 we plot the energy ratio (9) as a func-
tion of γatt=7.20ω−1
0, and we see that the minimum for
γopt=0.9145ω0touches the energy resolution level.
In this example, γoptis 1.52% smaller than γ1(this differ-
ence decreases as the energy threshold is lowered, see ap-
pendix B) and the system takes 3 .26% less time than the sys-
tem with γ1to reach the energy resolution level. Depending
on the experimental conditions, this can be significant, but for
many applications it suffices to take γ1as optimal. For ex-
ample, in the next section, where we experimentally test our
findings, the difference between γoptandγ1is undetectable
since it results in a change that is within the experimental res-
olution.
For all other types of initial conditions, the system’s energy
behavior is qualitatively the same as for the initial conditions
x0>0 and v0=0 (see supplementary material11, sections SII-
SIV), with one exception. For the special case in which the
initial displacement and velocity are of opposite signs and sat-
isfy|v0|>|x0ω0|, one can choose

initial condition, the overdamped solution with the damping
coefficient (24) returns to equilibrium sooner than any other
solution (details are given in supplementary material11, sec-
tion SIV , subsection C).
For the interested reader, in the supplementary material11,
sections SV and SVI, we examine the relationship between
the energy loss rates and the ratio of the critically damped to
underdamped energy and we show the results of the optimisa-
tion with respect to τA2, i.e., allowing the system to pass the
equilibrium position once, overshoot it, and reach the exper-
imental energy resolution when coming into the equilibrium
position the second time. It is expected that the advantage of
the underdamped oscillator over the critically damped oscilla-
tor is smaller for the results obtained this way, since the energy
of the underdamped oscillator gets closer to the energy of the
critically damped oscillator after each cycle, until it eventually
surpasses it (see Fig. 3(a) and (b)).
IV. EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION
We tested our model using a series RLC circuit. Other sys-
tems are also suitable for this purpose, such as a physical pen-
dulum with an eddy-current damping system that allows the
damping conditions to be controlled with great precision12.
The differential equation describing the circuit is
d2I(t)
dt2+R
LdI(t)
dt+1
LCI(t) =0. (25)
This equation has the form of a damped harmonic oscillator
(1), with
ω2
0=1
LCand 2 γ=R
L. (26)
Since in this work we always expressed γin units of ω0, it is
more convenient to write
γ=R
2L(ω0√
LC) =R
2r
C
Lω0=ζω0. (27)
We note that the current in the circuit I(t)exhibits damped
oscillations, but so does the voltage across the resistor RI(t),
which can be measured with an oscilloscope.
The circuit was constructed using a decade resistor with
a range from 0 Ωto 1M Ωwith a manufacturer stated toler-
ance of 1%, an inductor with inductance of (14.80±0.03)mH
and a variable capacitor with a range from 0 F to 10 µF.
The voltage was provided by a square wave from an Agi-
lent 33500B waveform generator with low frequency distor-
tion (±1µHz) and high voltage retention (1% of setting)13.
The voltage across the resistor was measured using a UNI-
T UTD2102CEX 100 MHz oscilloscope. The oscilloscope’s
measurement uncertainty depends on the readout scale and
was set to 1/4 of the smallest readout unit for both time and
voltage.
Initially, the wave source frequency was set to 200 Hz with
a voltage step size of 3.3 V . The capacitance was set to 1 nF
and the resistance to 800 Ω. We verified that the circuit hadno significant stray resistances and inductances with the Peak-
Tech 2005 and Fluke 115 multimeters. We observed under-
damped oscillations of the voltage across the resistor, shown
in Fig. 7. The blue line is the voltage from the switching
voltage source (unit voltage step of 1 V) and the red line is
the voltage measured across the resistor (unit voltage step of
265 mV). Both are measured on the same time axis with a unit
measuring step of 10 µs.
R=800Ω
FIG. 7. An example of the underdamped oscillating voltage mea-
sured across the resistor with circuit parameters R=800Ω,L=
14.8mH and C=1nF. V oltage is plotted on the vertical axis, and
time is plotted on the horizontal axis.
Using the oscilloscope’s measuring tools, we took five mea-
surements of the time interval between two successive max-
ima or minima of the oscillations and took the inverse to ob-
tain the frequency which was found to be (40.0±0.2)kHz.
Using this value, we determined the circuit’s capacitance and
obtained (1.06±0.01)nF. This is slightly different from the
value set on the variable capacitor due to unavoidable stray
capacitances in the circuit. Using these values, we can now
find the dimensionless damping factor ζof the circuit
ζ=R
2r
C
L= (0.107±0.001), (28)
which confirms that the oscillations take place well in the un-
derdamped regime. The value of the resistance that corre-
sponds to critically damped oscillations is:
Rcritical =2r
L
C= (7.47±0.04)kΩ. (29)
At this point we note that the calculated uncertainty of
Rcritical is purely a consequence of measurement uncertainties
and does not reflect the experimental resolution. Upon exam-
ination, we saw that a change in the resistance of the setup
which was smaller than 250 Ωin either direction resulted in
a voltage change that was within the experimental resolution,
which puts the resolution at the level of ≈7%.
After setting the value of the resistance to the critical value,
we performed the measurement of the voltage across the re-
sistor again. No oscillations were visible this time, as can be
seen in Fig.8, which is the expected behavior of a critically
damped oscillator.Damped harmonic oscillator revisited: the fastest route to equilibrium 8
R=7470Ω
FIG. 8. The oscilloscope readout in the case of the critically damped
circuit with R=7.47kΩ(red curve). The time interval required for
the voltage to drop from the maximal value to the resolution of the
oscilloscope was (28.0±0.4)µs, which is the interval between the
vertical red lines. The blue line is the switching voltage signal.
We measured the time interval between the moment when
the signal was at its maximum and the moment when it be-
came indistinguishable from the oscilloscope’s measurement
resolution, which was verified by the measuring tool. This
resolution is taken to be 1/4 of the smallest measuring in-
crement, which in this case corresponds to ≈13mV . Since
the maximum voltage was ≈800mV , the resolution is ap-
proximately 1.625% of the maximal voltage. The measured
time interval between these two moments was (28.0±0.4)µs
= (7.1±0.1)ω−1
0. The uncertainty in the measurement is
a consequence of the time resolution of the measuring tool,
which has a single step of ∆t=0.2µs.
Since we measured the time interval starting from the mo-
ment the oscillator was at its maximum displacement. This,
in effect, sets the initial condition to that of section III, so we
can compare our measurements to the results obtained there.
Looking at Fig.3(a), we note that at t= (7.1±0.1)ω−1
0, the
energy of the critically damped oscillator is in the interval
[6.6,9.4]·10−5E0. The underdamped γ1=ζ1ω0for the cen-
ter of this interval is obtained from (22), which translates to a
value of resistance of
R1=2ζ1r
L
C= (6.52±0.03)kΩ. (30)
This value was rounded to 6.5 k Ωdue to the fact that our ex-
perimental sensitivity to resistance is of the order of 250 Ω.
Note that since the experimental sensitivity to a change in re-
sistance is ≈7%, setting the resistance to 6.5 k Ωin fact covers
a range of ζwhich will include both ζ1, as well as ζopt, which
differs from it at the order of a few percent.
We first set the value of the resistance to the predicted
value of the optimal resistance of 6.5 k Ω. In Fig. 9 we show
the readout from the oscilloscope for this resistance value.
The time required for the voltage to drop from its maximum
value to the resolution of the oscilloscope was (22.4±0.4)µs.
Compared to the critically damped system, this is a decrease
in time of (20±3)%, in accordance with the findings given in
Table I.
R=6500Ω
FIG. 9. The oscilloscope readout in the case of the underdamped
circuit with R=6.5kΩ(red curve). The time interval required for
the voltage to drop from the maximal value to the resolution of the
oscilloscope was measured to be (22.4±0.4)µs.
Next, we systematically changed the resistance in steps of
250Ω, from 4k Ωto 8kΩ. We always ensured that the max-
imum voltage of the signal was set to 800 mV . We confirmed
that, within the experimental resolution, the voltage dropped
mostly quickly to zero when the resistance was set to 6.5 k Ω,
as predicted by (30).
Decreasing the value of the resistance below the optimal
value, we slowly start to notice the overshoot of the volt-
age signal under the reference voltage (see supplementary
material11, section SVII). For resistances above the critical
value, the system becomes overdamped and the time it takes
for the signal to drop to the reference level is longer than the
critical case.
V. CONCLUSION
The results presented here show that, contrary to popular
belief, critical damping is never the best choice if we want
the damped oscillator to reach an equilibrium state as soon as
possible. For most initial conditions, a unique damping coeffi-
cient in the underdamped regime can be determined for which
the oscillator reaches the equilibrium state the most quickly.
An exception to this occurs for a specific choice of initial con-
ditions, when an overdamped oscillator is the optimal choice.
These findings can be significant for understanding all sys-
tems described by the damped harmonic oscillator model,
such as shock absorbers in cars14, RLC and other oscillat-
ing circuits, measuring devices15, etc. Recently, the damped
oscillator model was used to characterize the convergence of
machine learning algorithms, and a connection was estab-
lished between the differential equations associated with the
algorithms and the damped oscillator model16. Although the
algorithms converge to solutions with some finite precision,
critical damping has previously been considered desirable in
terms of convergence speed16. We envision that our results
may be significant in that context as well.Damped harmonic oscillator revisited: the fastest route to equilibrium 9

Appendix A: Lambert function
In this section we discuss in more detail the solutions of
equation (17). The solutions to this equation, τ1andτ2, are
moments in time for which the envelope A(t)of the under-
damped oscillator equals the displacement xc(t)of the oscil-
lator in the critical regime. First, we note that (17) can be
rewritten as
ω
ω0+ωτ
e−(ω0−γ)τ=1, (A1)
after which the substitution
u≡ −(ω0−γ)τ+γ−ω0
ω0(A2)
allows us to express (A1) in the form called the Lambert
equation8
ueu=y (A3)
with the shorthand notation
y≡γ−ω0
ωeω0−γ
ω0. (A4)
We note here that −1/e<y<0, since 0 <γ<ω0in the
underdamped regime. In this case, the Lambert equation (A3)
has two solutions for the unknown u8:
u1=W0(y),u2=W−1(y), (A5)
where W0andW−1are two branches of the Lambert W func-
tion. We can write this compactly as u1,2=W0,−1(y). By in-
serting the solutions u1andu2back into the substitution (A2),
we arrive at two solutions for crossing times τ1andτ2, as writ-
ten in (18):

time instants t
In Fig. B1 we show the base 10 logarithm of the energy
ratio (9) as a function of γ∈[0,1.5ω0]for five time instants.
We see that as time increases, new local minima are formed,
but the global minimum persists and its position approaches
the critical damping value γ=ω0. The black dot on each of
the curves indicates the value for γfor which the system is at
the equilibrium position for the first time at that instant. We
see that the subset of the damping coefficients, for which the
energy is lower than the energy for this γ, decreases in range as
time increases. Thus, the difference between γ1andγopt(from
subsection III D) decreases as we optimize towards lower and
lower energies. Behavior for t>15ω−1
0is qualitatively the
same.

SI. PROOF OF xod(t)≥xc(t)WHEN STARTING FROM
THE SAME INITIAL DISPLACEMENT AT REST
Let us look at the solutions for the critically damped and the
overdamped oscillator, both starting from rest with the same
displacement from equilibrium:
xc(t) =x0(1+ω0t)e−ω0t, (S1)
xod(t) =x0e−γtγ+α
2αeαt−γ−α
2αe−αt
, (S2)
where α=q
γ2−ω2
0andγ>ω0. Here we use the fact that
both xc(t)andxod(t)are entire functions so we can use their
Taylor expansions around any point to compare them. First,
we recast the overdamped solution in a sum of hyperbolic
functions, making all of the coefficients of the Taylor expan-
sions positive for easier comparison:
xod(t) =x0e−γtγ
αsinh(αt)+cosh(αt)
. (S3)
The Taylor expansion of the overdamped case around αt=0
is equal to:
xod(t) = x0e−γt∞
∑
n=0γ
α(αt)2n+1
(2n+1)!+(αt)2n

2!+...
=x0e−γt
1+γt1
1!+α2t2
2!+γα2t3
3!+...
. (S4)
Our goal is to compare the displacements of the critically
damped and the overdamped case. We claim that for the se-
lected initial conditions the displacement of the overdamped
case will always be greater or equal than the displacement of
the critically damped case, xod(t)≥xc(t). Dividing both sides
of this inequality with x0and multiplying by eγtleaves the
inequality sign unchanged since both of these factors are pos-
itive. We thus have, using the already calculated Taylor ex-
pansion of the left-hand side:

1+γt1
1!+α2t2
2!+γα2t3
3!+...
≥(1+ω0t)e(γ−ω0)t.(S5)The Taylor expansion of the right-hand side of (S5) around
(γ−ω0)t=0 is equal to:
1+∞
∑
n=1(γ−ω0)n−1(γ+(n−1)ω0)tn
n!. (S6)
We can now compare the left- and right-hand sides of (S5)
by comparing the corresponding coefficients of tn. First, note
that the coefficients of t0andt1coincide on both sides. Next,
we can see that the left-hand side expansion has a different
coefficient depending on the parity of n. We start by looking
at the case when nis even and set it to n=2k, with k∈N.
Comparing the powers of t2kgives:
α2k
(2k)!≥(γ−ω0)2k−1(γ+(2k−1)ω0)
(2k)!. (S7)
Cancelling (2k)! and expanding α=q
γ2−ω2
0we get:
(γ2−ω2
0)k≥(γ+(2k−1)ω0)(γ−ω0)2k−1
[(γ−ω0)(γ+ω0)]k≥(γ+(2k−1)ω0)(γ−ω0)2k−1.(S8)
Cancelling (γ−ω0)kwon’t change the inequality sign since
γ>ω0. We are therefore left with:
(γ+ω0)k≥(γ+(2k−1)ω0)(γ−ω0)k−1. (S9)
Simplyfing the right-hand side further we get:
(γ+ω0)k≥(γ+2kω0−ω0)(γ−ω0)k−1
≥(γ−ω0)k+2kω0(γ−ω0)k−1.(S10)
The left-hand side can be written as ((γ−ω0) +2ω0)kand
expanded using the binomial theorem:
((γ−ω0)+2ω0)k=k
∑
i=0k
i
(γ−ω0)k−i(2ω0)i
= (γ−ω0)k+k(γ−ω0)k−1(2ω0)
+k
∑
i=2k
i
(γ−ω0)k−i(2ω0)i.(S11)
We can see that the first two terms of the binomial expansion,
which have been written explicitly, equal the right-hand side
of (S10). All the other terms of the expansion are positive,
making the left-hand side of (S10) strictly larger that the right-
hand side of (S10) whenever k>1 and the two sides are equal
in case k=1.
Next, we look at the case when n is odd and set it to n=
2k+1, with k∈N. Comparing the powers of t2k+1gives:
γα2k
(2k+1)!>(γ−ω0)2k(γ+2kω0)
(2k+1)!. (S12)
Note that in this case we assume that he left-hand side of the
equation is strictly larger than the right-hand side, which weDamped harmonic oscillator revisited: the fastest route to equilibrium S2
now demonstrate. As earlier, we cancel (2k+1)! and expand
α=q
γ2−ω2
0to get:
γ(γ2−ω2
0)k>(γ+2kω0)(γ−ω0)2k
γ[(γ−ω0)(γ+ω0)]k>(γ+2kω0)(γ−ω0)2k.(S13)
Next, we cancel (γ−ω0)kand are left with
γ(γ+ω0)k>(γ+2kω0)(γ−ω0)k. (S14)
The left-hand side can be written as γ((γ−ω0) +2ω0)kand
expanded using the binomial theorem:
γ((γ−ω0)+2ω0)k=γk
∑
i=0k
i
(γ−ω0)k−i(2ω0)i
=γ(γ−ω0)k+γk(γ−ω0)k−1(2ω0)
+γk
∑
i=2k
i
(γ−ω0)k−i(2ω0)i.(S15)
The second term of the expansion can be rewritten as
γk(γ−ω0)k−1(2ω0) = ( γ−ω0+ω0)k(γ−ω0)k−1(2ω0)
=2kω0(γ−ω0)k+2kω2
0(γ−ω0)k−1.
This makes the entire left hand side equal to:
γ(γ+ω0)k=γ(γ−ω0)k+2kω0(γ−ω0)k
+2kω2
0(γ−ω0)k−1+γk
∑
i=2k
i
(γ−ω0)k−i(2ω0)i.
Since the first two terms coincide with the right-hand side of
(S14) and all the other terms are positive, we conclude that
the inequality holds true. This is also true in the special case
when k=1 since then the left-hand side equals
γ(γ+ω0)1=γ(γ−ω0)1+2ω0(γ−ω0)1+2ω2
0,(S16)
which is clearly larger that the right-hand side in this special
case. In conclusion, the left-hand side of (S5) is in all cases
equal or larger than the right-hand side of (S5) and therefore
the statement that xod(t)≥xc(t)is always true with these ini-
tial conditions, with the equality holding true only for t=0.
SII. INITIAL CONDITION: ZERO ELONGATION AND
MAXIMUM VELOCITY
We next focus on the case with initial conditions x0=0 and
v0>0. Here we present the solutions for all three oscillator
regimes with the given initial condition taken into account
xud(t) =v0
ωe−γtsin(ωt), (S17)

xod(t) =v0

2e−αt,(S19)where the already introduced notation was used. In Fig. S1(a)
we show the underdamped solution xud(t)with γ=0.9ω0as
a red solid curve, the critically damped solution xc(t)as a
black dashed curve, and the overdamped solutions xod(t)with
γ=1.1ω0as the blue dotted curve and γ=5ω0as the red
dotted curve. All the solutions are scaled by the same fac-
tor making them dimensionless. We see that at the end of the
given time range the underdamped solution is closest to the
equilibrium. Looking at the overdamped curves in Fig. S1(a)
one might think that it is possible to choose a very large damp-
ing coefficient γand reach the equilibrium sooner than any
of the underdamped and/or critically damped oscillators. We
argue here that this is not the case. In Fig. S1(b) we show
the underdamped and the critically damped solution, just as in
Fig. S1(a), as well as overdamped solutions with γ=100ω0as
a blue dotted curve and γ=200ω0as a red dotted curve. We
see that for γ≫ω0, the overdamped solution has a step-like
behaviour which can be explained by an analytical approxi-
mation as follows. For γ≫ω0we have

Using (S20) and (S19) we get

From (S21) we see that in this limit the overdamped solution
rapidly rises form zero at t=0 tov0/(2γ)fort≳1/γ, which
is in perfect agreement with the results shown in Fig. S1(b). In
conclusion, selecting a very large γ(comapared to ω0) makes
the oscillator reach a practically infinitesimal maximal elon-
gation very quickly before it very slowly starts to return to the
equilibrium position. Therefore, similarly as in the main text,
we exclude the overdamped regime from further analysis in
this subsection.
In Fig. S2 we show the base 10 logarithm of the ratio (9), for
underdamped oscillators with γ=0.85ω0as the green dash-
dotted curve, γ=0.9ω0as the red solid curve, γ=0.95ω0as
the blue dotted curve and the critically damped oscillator as
the black dashed curve. We note that with these initial con-
ditions the behaviour of the oscillators is qualitatively very
similar to the one shown in Fig. 3(a). Thus, we omit the finer
details and proceed with the optimisation as described in the
main text.
The underdamped oscillator, with given initial conditions,
reaches the equilibrium position for the n-th time at moments
given by
τAn=nπ

where n∈N. We define the moment the system has settled
down in the equilibrium as the moment when its energy is
equal to 10−δE0, with some δ>0. The underdamped coeffi-
cient γ1is then found as the one for which the system reaches
this energy level at the moment given by τA1. Since at this
moment the total energy of the oscillator is equal to its kineticDamped harmonic oscillator revisited: the fastest route to equilibrium S3

SIII. SAME SIGN INITIAL ELONGATION AND VELOCITY
The case in which the initial conditions are such that x0̸=0
andv0̸=0, but are of the same sign is a direct combination
of cases already explored in main text and in previous sub-
section. Therefore, the conclusions drawn there also hold true
here and we can always find an optimal underdamped coeffi-
cient such that the energy of the oscillator with this γdrops
to a level under a preset threshold when arriving in the equi-
librium position for the first (or second, third, etc.) time. The
relative time advantage of the underdamped oscillator as com-
pared to the critically damped oscillator will depend on the
initial conditions as well as the preset value of energy in an
algebraically non-trivial way, but will nevertheless be greater
than zero for the best-case optimization choice. Therefore,
we omit the finer details in this section and conclude that our
findings are still valid.Damped harmonic oscillator revisited: the fastest route to equilibrium S4
SIV. OPPOSITE SIGN INITIAL ELONGATION AND
VELOCITY
Finally, we focus on the case with initial conditions x0>
0 and v0<0 (or vice-versa, which can be accounted for by
a coordinate sign flip). As we will see in what follows, for
these initial conditions, the behaviour of the oscillator in the
underdamped regime is qualitatively the same as for already
analysed initial conditions, while the critically damped and
the overdamped regimes show some new qualities. Therefore,
here we repeat the solutions for the critically damped and the
overdamped oscillators, (3) and (4), with v0=−|v0|taken into
account

. (S26)
Depending on the relationship between the initial kinetic po-
tential energies, we analyse three cases.
A. The initial kinetic energy is smaller than the initial
potential energy
The condition that the initial kinetic energy is smaller than
the initial potential energy can be recast in the form |v0|<
ω0x0. If this condition is true, the critically damped so-
lution (S25) has no zeroes, so it asymptotically approaches
the equilibrium position without ever overshooting it. The
overdamped solution (S26) approaches the equilibrium posi-
tion more slowly than the critically damped solution due to
a higher damping coefficient. Thus, we can conclude that
the overdamped solution is further away from the equilib-
rium, when compared to the critically damped solution, for
anyt>0. Therefore, for the selected initial condition the
overdamped oscillator also never overshoots the equilibrium
position.
In Fig. S3 we show the base 10 logarithm of the ratio (9)
for the underdamped oscillator with γ=0.9ω0as the solid
red curve, the critically damped oscillator as the black dashed
curve and the overdamped oscillator with γ=1.1ω0as the
blue dotted curve. To draw the curves, we selected |v0|=
ω0x0/2. We see that for this type of initial conditions, the
behaviour of the underdamped oscillator compared to the crit-
ically damped oscillator is qualitatively the same as already
examined and shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S2. Thus, one can
perform the optimisation of the underdamped coefficient sim-
ilarly as before.
B. The initial kinetic energy is equal to the initial potential
energy
The case when the initial kinetic energy is equal to the ini-
tial potential energy can be written as |v0|=ω0x0. In this0123456789101112131415−10−8−6−4−20

case, the linear term in the critically damped solution (S25)
cancels and we are left with purely exponential behaviour,
xc(t) =x0e−ω0t. Thus, the critically damped solution is again
without any zeroes, i.e., it never reaches the equilibrium po-
sition. Following the same line of reasoning as in SIV A we
can conclude that the displacement of the overdamped oscil-
lator (S26) is greater than the displacement of the critically
damped oscillator for any t>0.

and potential energies are the same.
In Fig. S4 we show the base 10 logarithm of the ratio (9)
for an underdamped oscillator with γ=0.9ω0as the solid
red curve, the critically damped oscillator as the black dashed
curve and the overdamped oscillator with γ=1.1ω0as the
blue dotted curve. In this case, we can notice that the un-
derdamped oscillator energy is equal to the energy of the
critically damped oscillator for the first time already when
t=5ω−1
0. This is much earlier compared to the first crossing

can in principle perform the optimisation of the underdamped
coefficient similarly as before, but with a smaller advantage
compared to the critically damped solution.
C. The initial kinetic energy is greater than the initial
potential energy
This final case is realized when |v0|>ω0x0. In contrast to
previous cases, the critically damped oscillator solution (S25)
has a zero at
tc=x0
|v0|−ω0x0. (S27)
Thus, it overshoots the equilibrium position, reaches a
new maximal elongation and afterwards asymptotically ap-
proaches the equilibrium position. In this case, the over-
damped oscillator solution (S26) also has a zero at
tod=1
2αln(γ−α)+|v0|
(γ+α)−|v0|. (S28)
Depending on the magnitude of γ, the overdamped oscilla-
tor may, or may not, overshoot the equilibrium position. We
can choose an overdamped γsuch that the factor multiplying
the first exponential in the parenthesis in (S26) cancels, which
happens when
˜γ=
|v0|
x02
+ω2

|v0|

The solution to the overdamped oscillator then simplifies into
xod(t) =|v0|−(˜γ−˜α)x0
2˜αe−(˜γ+˜α)t=x0e−(˜γ+˜α)t,(S30)
where ˜α=q
˜γ2−ω2
0. For the overdamped coefficient ˜γ, the
denominator of the fraction under the logarithm in (S28) also
vanishes, which means that the zero of the overdamped solu-
tion happens when tod→∞. Thus, for γ∈⟨ω0,˜γ⟩the over-
damped solution overshoots the equilibrium position once,
and for γ∈[˜γ,∞⟩it approaches the equilibrium position with-
out ever overshooting it. Since ˜γ>ω0and ˜α>0 in (S30),
it’s clear that the overdamped oscillator (S30) approaches the
equilibrium faster than the critically damped oscillator.
In Fig. S5(a) we show the base 10 logarithm of the ratio (9)
for the underdamped oscillator with γ=0.9ω0as the solid
red curve, the critically damped oscillator as the black dashed
curve, and the overdamped oscillators with γ=1.245ω0as
the purple curve, γ=1.25ω0as the blue dotted curve and
γ=1.255ω0as the cyan dashed curve. To draw the curves we
have selected the condition |v0|=2ω0x0. With this choice, it
follows from (S29) that ˜γ=1.25ω0, which is shown as the
blue dotted curve in Fig. S5(b). We can clearly see that the
overdamped oscillator with ˜γdecays faster than both the un-
derdamped and the critically damped oscillators. For values
of the damping coefficient that are slightly smaller than ˜γ, likeγ=1.245ω0shown with the purple curve, the system could
get somewhat sooner to some desired energy level, which can
be seen for the energy level of 10−7E0in this example. We
could, in principle, optimise the damping coefficient of the
overdamped oscillator, but, as Fig. S5(a) suggests, this would
bring an insignificant time benefit compared to ˜γ. Thus, we
conclude that for this type of initial conditions, the fastest
route to equilibrium is achieved by simply choosing the pa-
rameters of the system so that the damping coefficient is as
close to ˜γas possible.

This means that the maxima are achieved at moments in time
for which the relative energy losses of the critically damped
and the underdamped oscillators are of equal values (for clar-
ification of terminology, please see equations (11) and (13),
as well as the paragraph following them). In Fig. 4(b) we
show the energy loss rate of the critically damped oscillator
as the black dashed curve and the energy loss rate of the un-
derdamped oscillator for the case when γ=0.9ω0as the red
solid curve. We see that the three maxima of the ratio (S31),
shown in Fig. 4(a), happen at the first, the third, and the fifth
crossing of the two energy loss rates, indicated by arrows and
denoted by τmax n, with n={1,2,3}. The values of τmax nare
obtained numerically form the graph, since they can not be
determined analytically.
For the chosen case of the underdamped oscillator the maxi-
mal magnitude of the energy loss rate equals 4 γ=3.6ω0. This
means that, according to (13), βud=1 at a time instant we de-
note with τA1. In this moment, the system arrives for the first
time to the equilibrium position and its total energy is its ki-
netic energy. In contrast, the energy loss rate is zero when
βud=0 at a time instant denoted by τB1, in which the total
energy of the oscillator is equal to its potential energy. To
be clear, here we chose an underdamped oscillator for which
γ=0.9ω0only to set an example. Choosing any other γin the
underdamped regime yields qualitatively the same behavior.
The quantitative differences for various cases are in the num-
ber of maxima before the equality of the energies of the under-
damped and the critically damped oscillators is achieved, and
in the height of these maxima. In Fig. S7(a) and (b) we show
the ratio (S31) for γ=0.85ω0and 0 .95ω0. In the same fig-
ure, we use dashed vertical lines to denote the first moment in
which the energy of the critically damped oscillator becomes
equal to the energy or the underdamped oscillator.
Here we comment on an approximation for the moments
τmax nfor which the ratio (S31) has maxima. Visual inspection
of Fig. S6 suggests that a good first guess for the moments
τmax nis in the vicinity of moments when βud=1/2. Specif-
ically, for the case shown in Fig. S6 we find βud(τmax 1) =
0.477, and similarly βud(τmax 2,3)≈0.5. Hence, the moments
in time when maxima are achieved can be excellently approx-
imated by the moments tnfor which βud(tn) =1/2, i.e. when
the kinetic energy of the oscillator is equal to its potential en-
ergy. This condition can be written down analytically as
˙xud(tn)2=ω2
0xud(tn)2. (S34)

In Table SIII. we show the results obtained this way for var-

the underdamped oscillator compared to the critically damped
oscillator, given in column five is smaller than was the case
in Table I. This is expected, since the energy of the under-
damped oscillator is closer in value to the energy of the crit-
ically damped oscillator after each cycle, until it eventually
surpasses it (see Fig. 3(a) and (b)). It is important to note
the negative result in the first row of column five, indicat-
ing that the critically damped oscillator reaches the energy
E(t) =10−4E0before the underdamped oscillator. We could,
of course, also look for an damping coefficient such that we
declare that the underdamped oscillator has settled down in
the equilibrium at the third, or fourth, etc., pass through the
equilibrium position, but we would get ever smaller relative
advantage over the critical oscillator.
SVII. EXPERIMENT WITH A DETECTABLE
OVERSHOOT
As an example of the experiment with a detectable over-
shoot, we give the readout of the voltage for a resistance valueDamped harmonic oscillator revisited: the fastest route to equilibrium S8
of 5 kΩon Fig.S8, where we noticed that the second cross-
ing happened at (25.2±0.4)µs, after which the voltage was
below the oscilloscope resolution.
R=5000Ω
FIG. S8. The readout on the oscilloscope in the case of the under-
damped circuit with R=5kΩ(red curve). The time interval required
for the voltage to drop from the maximal value to the resolution of
the oscilloscope was measured to be (25.2±0.4)µs. An overshoot
of the signal under the reference voltage can clearly be seen.
