Abstract: We explore inequality constraints as a new tool for numerically evaluating
Feynman integrals. A convergent Feynman integral is non-negative if the integrand is non-
negative in either loop momentum space or Feynman parameter space. Applying various
identities, all such integrals can be reduced to linear sums of a small set of master inte-
grals, leading to infinitely many linear constraints on the values of the master integrals.
The constraints can be solved as a semidefinite programming problem in mathematical
optimization, producing rigorous two-sided bounds for the integrals which are observed to
converge rapidly as more constraints are included, enabling high-precision determination of
the integrals. Positivity constraints can also be formulated for the ϵexpansion terms in di-
mensional regularization and reveal hidden consistency relations between terms at different
orders in ϵ. We introduce the main methods using one-loop bubble integrals, then present a
nontrivial example of three-loop banana integrals with unequal masses, where 11 top-level
master integrals are evaluated to high precision.arXiv:2303.15624v2  [hep-ph]  3 Oct 2023Contents

1 Introduction
Evaluation of Feynman integrals is both a classic problem and an expanding frontier of
research in quantum field theory, with many areas of applications such as collider physics,
statistical mechanics, and gravitational physics. A widely used method for numerical eval-
uations of Feynman integrals is Monte Carlo integration with sector decomposition [1–7].
Another method, numerical series solutions of differential equations [8–14], enjoyed in-
tense developments in the last few years. Some other methods, which are either inherently
numerical or can be used numerically, include Mellin-Barnes representations [15–22], differ-
ence equations from dimensional recursion [23–25], Loop-tree duality [26–28], and tropical
Monte Carlo integration [29, 30]. See also books [31, 32] which comprehensively review
both numerical and analytic methods. Despite these developments, numerical evaluation
– 1 –of Feynman integrals still presents challenges in the ongoing quest for higher precisions in
perturbative calculations, and new explorations are warranted.
A fruitful recent idea in theoretical physics is the use of positivity constraints, e.g.
arising from the unitarity of a Hilbert space, to constrain unknown parameters from first
principles, sometimes reaching great accuracy. Prominent examples include the conformal
bootstrap [33], the non-perturbative S-matrix bootstrap (see review [34] and references
within), and EFT positivity bounds [35–41]. Some of the predictions in the S-matrix
and EFT contexts have been checked against explicit perturbative calculations involving
Feynman integrals [42–44], so it is natural to explore positivity properties for Feynman
integrals themselves. What directly inspired this paper, though, is recent applications of
positivity constraints to bootstrapping simple quantum mechanical systems and matrix
models [45–49] as well as lattice models [50–52], which crucially use various linear identities
that are reminiscent of integration-by-parts identities for Feynman integrals [53] as well as a
numerical technique known as semidefinite programming [54] which will be adapted to our
calculations. Semidefinite programming was introduced to theoretical physics by Ref. [55]
in the conformal bootstrap and subsequently applied to wider contexts.
In this work, we will formulate positivity constraints for Euclidean Feynman integrals ,
which can be either (1) integrals in Euclidean spacetime or can be rewritten in Euclidean
spacetime after a trivial Wick rotation, or (2) integrals in Minkowskian spacetime but with
kinematics in the so called Euclidean region , i.e. with center-of-mass energy of incoming
momenta below the particle production threshold. In case (1), the loop integrand in Eu-
clidean momentum space has non-negative propagator denominators, and the integrand is
non-negative as long as the numerator is non-negative. In case (2), the integral is real due
to the absence of Cutkosky cuts. After Feynman parametrization, the parametric integrand
involves non-negative graph polynomials and stays non-negative when multiplied by a posi-
tive function of the Feynman parameters. In both cases, a non-negative integrand implies a
non-negative integral as long as the integral is convergent, i.e. has no ultraviolet or infrared
divergences. The initial restriction to convergent integrals is not a fundamental limitation,
as divergent integrals can be rewritten as linear sums of convergent integrals multiplied
by divergent coefficients [56], and then it suffices to evaluate the convergent integrals as a
Taylor series in the dimensional regularization parameter ϵ.
We will see that positivity constraints, expressed in the language of semidefinite pro-
gramming, are strong enough to precisely determine the values of Feynman integrals. More-
over, rigorous error bounds can be obtained. Our machinery relies on linear relations
between Feynman integrals, including integration-by-parts identities [53] and dimension-
shifting identities [57], to express all positivity constraints as linear constraints on the
values of a set of master integrals.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the main methods
using the simple example of massive one-loop bubble integrals. Specifically, Subsection 2.1
gives a short review of two kinds of linear identities for Feynman integrals, integration-
by-parts identities and dimension shifting identities. Subsection 2.2 discusses positivity
constraints in Euclidean momentum space, starting from ad hoc constraints that narrow
down the allowed value of the bubble master integral to ∼50%accuracy at an example
– 2 –Figure 1 . The one-loop bubble integral with external legs of virtuality p2and two internal massive
line with the same squared mass m2.
kinematic point, then developing the machinery of semidefinite programming to reach an
accuracy of 10−14. We switch to Feynman parameter space in Subsection 2.3, which allows
calculating the integrals in a wider region of kinematic parameters below the two-particle
cut threshold, while many steps of the calculations are unchanged from the momentum-
space case. Subsection 2.4 formulates positivity constraints for ϵexpansions of Feynman
integrals in dimensional regularization. Subsection 2.5 presents an alternative method for
calculating the ϵexpansion based on numerical differentiation of results w.r.t. the spacetime
dimension. Having laid out most of the methods, in Section 3, we present a nontrivial
application to three-loop banana integrals with four unequal masses. Due to a large number
of undetermined master integrals, semidefinite programming becomes essential in efficiently
solving the positivity constraints. We calculate all master integrals at an example kinematic
point up to the second order in ϵexpansion in d= 2−2ϵ, and a detailed account of the
numerical accuracies is given. We end with some discussions in Section 4.

propagators is m, with the two propagators raised to powers a1anda2. If either a1ora2
is non-positive, Eq. (2.1) becomes a massive tadpole integral possibly with a numerator.
Ifa1anda2are both non-positive, the integral vanishes in dimensional regularization.

We will use positivity constraints to numerically evaluate bubble integrals Eq. (2.1)
forp2<4m2, i.e. below the two-particle production threshold. We first consider the case
– 3 –p2<0, i.e. p2>0. In this case, pcan be literally embedded in Euclidean spacetime
as a vector with real-valued components, and we will derive positivity constraints starting
from the loop momentum integral Eq. (2.2). We will subsequently present a treatment
applicable to all p2<4m2by using Feynman parameter representations of the integrals.
Before actual calculations, we first briefly review linear identities for the Feynman integrals
involved, arising from integration by parts anddimension shifting . Efficiently solving IBP
identities for more complicated Feynman integrals is a major research problem, and we refer
readers to Refs. [23, 58–65] for relevant computational algorithms and software.

The process of carrying out the above calculation and rewriting any integral as linear
sums of master integrals is referred to as IBP reduction . Here are two examples showing
how other integrals are expressed as linear combinations of the basis Eq. (2.9),

The tadpole integral Id

Eqs. (2.20) and (2.21) are the dimension-shifting identities that express the two master
integrals in Eq. (2.9) in lower spacetime dimensions to the same master integrals in higher
spacetime dimensions. By inverting Eqs. (2.20) and (2.21), we obtain dimension shift-
ing identities in the reverse direction, i.e. expressing master integrals in higher spacetime
dimensions in terms of master integrals in lower spacetime dimensions,

2.2 Positivity constraints in loop momentum space
Here we focus on the case p2<0and use the Wick-rotated expression for the integrals,
Eq. (2.2), with
p2=M2=−p2. (2.24)
We will later present a Feynman parameter-space treatment that seems more powerful and
in particular works for all p2<4m2, but the loop momentum space treatment here will
help build up intuitions.
2.2.1 A crude first attempt
We first consider the following two convergent integrals with non-negative integrands in
loop momentum space,
Id
2,2=ZddleγEϵ
πd/21
(l2+m2)2[(p+l)2+m2]2,

πd/21
(l2+m2)[(p+l)2+m2]
×1
l2+m2−1
(p+l)2+m22
.(2.25)
We have used the notation Eq. (2.1) and the subsequent Wick rotation Eq. (2.2). Since the
integrals are massive and have no infrared divergence, a simple ultraviolet power-counting
– 6 –shows that the above integrals are convergent near 4dimensions. These integrals therefore
have finite non-negative values,
Id
2,2≥0, Id
3,1+Id
1,3−2Id
2,2≥0. (2.26)
By IBP reduction as described in Section 2.1, the above inequalities translate into con-
straints on the finite master integrals on the LHS of Eq. (2.9). The needed IBP reduction
results are shown in Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11), in which we will rewrite p2=−M2. We use the
parametrization Eq. (2.13) to factor out the positive tadpole integral Id
3,0, finally arriving
at

2,1=Id
2,1/Id
3,0≤2M2+ 12m2
(8−d)M2+ 12m2,for any d <6.(2.28)
It is easily shown that the LHS of the inequality above is always less than the RHS when
d <6, so the normalized bubble integral ˆId
2,1=Id
2,1/Id
3,0is bounded in a finite range. When
dtends to 6from below, the LHS and RHS of the inequality both approach 1, leading to
the prediction that Id
2,1/Id
3,0→1asd→6; this is exactly as expected since both Id
2,1and
Id
3,0have an ultraviolet pole 1/(d−6)with the same coefficient. Specializing to the case
d= 4, Eq. (2.28) becomes
2m2
M2+ 2m2≤ˆId=4
2,1≤M2+ 6m2
2M2+ 6m2,ford= 4. (2.29)
Let us arbitrarily choose an example numerical point,
M2= 2, m2= 1, (2.30)
At this point, Eq. (2.29) becomes
0.5≤ˆId=4
2,1≤0.8,forM2= 2, m2= 1. (2.31)
This is consistent with the analytic result given in Appendix A with p2=−M2,

– 7 –Figure 2 . Comparison between ad hoc positivity bounds Eq. (2.29) and the analytic result for the
bubble integral ˆId=4
2,1normalized according to Eq. (2.14).
Since our crude positivity bound Eq. (2.31) and the analytic result Eq. (2.32) only
depend on the dimensionless ratio M2/m2, we plot them in Fig. 2. It is not surprising
that all three curves in the plot tend to 1asM2/m2→0, since in this case we can set
the external momenta to 0, and the bubble and tadpole integrals in Eq. (2.9) then become
identical. The general observation is that our positivity bounds can become exact in special
limits of kinematics or the spacetime dimension.
2.2.2 Formulation in terms of matrix eigenvalues
In preparation for the introduction of semidefinite programming, we will first recast posi-
tivity constraints in terms of eigenvalues of an appropriate matrix. To simplify the notation
of Eq. (2.1), let us define the following shorthand notations for the denominators,
ρ1=−l2+m2, ρ 2=−(p+l)2+m2. (2.35)
Let us consider a class of positive-semidefinite integrals of the bubble family, parametrized
by three real numbers α1, α2, α3,

and a 3×3symmetric matrix M, given by

, (2.38)
– 8 –using the index notation Eq. (2.1). The expression Eq. (2.36) is non-negative for any choice
of(α1, α2, α3)because after Wick rotation, ρ1andρ2are non-negative and the squared
expression is also non-negative. Therefore, the symmetric matrix Mmust be positive-
semidefinite, represented by the shorthand notation
M≽0, . (2.39)
By IBP reduction, the matrix entries of Mare integrals which can be re-expressed as
linear sums of the two finite master integrals on the LHS of Eq. (2.9). As an example,

which is then reduced to the finite master integrals according to Eq. (2.10). Therefore M
can be written as the sum of two individual master integral contributions,
M=Id

M1+ˆId
2,1M2
, (2.41)
using the notation ˆId
2,1=Id
2,1/Id
3,0introduced in Eq. (2.13). Since I3,0is itself positive, the
positive-semidefiniteness of Mimplies
eM≡M/Id
3,0=M1+ˆId
2,1M2≽0, (2.42)
again employing the shorthand notation introduced in Eq. (2.39) to indicate positive-
semidefiniteness. Equivalently, all the eigenvalues of M1+ˆId
2,1M2must be non-negative.
In Eq. (2.41), the matrices M1andM2contain entries that are rational functions of the
spacetime dand kinematic variables p2, m2, since IBP reduction always produces rational
coefficients for master integrals. Although the general ddependence is not complicated, we
will present M1andM2in the d= 4case for brevity of presentation,

Now we treat ˆId
2,1as an undetermined parameter to be constrained by Eq. (2.42). Again
we look at the example numerical point as in Eq. (2.30),
M2= 2, m2= 1, (2.45)
and plot the three eigenvalues of the 3×3matrix eM=M1+ˆId
2,1M2in Fig. 3. It can be
seen in the figure that most of the parameter range shown is ruled out due to the presence

of a negative eigenvalue indicated by the lowest orange curve. In Fig. 4, we zoom in to a
smaller parameter region and only plot the smallest eigenvalue, since the matrix is positive
semidefinite as long as the smallest eigenvalue is non-negative. The allowed parameter
region shown in the plot is
0.630≤ˆId=4
2,1≤0.847, (2.46)
which provides a more stringent lower bound than the previous result Eq. (2.31). In fact, far
better lower and upper bounds can be achieved in this approach by using an ansatz larger
than the one in Eq. (2.36). For example, let us replace the squared term in Eq. (2.36) by
an arbitrary degree-3 polynomial in 1/ρ1and1/ρ2, parametrized by 10 undetermined free
coefficients. We obtain the constraint,

Repeating the above analysis, we obtain a constraint for ˆId
2,1similar to Eq. (2.42), except
that the matrices involved have 10×10sizes. The ten eigenvalues as functions of ˆId
2,1are

the ten eigenvalues are too close to each other on the plot to be seen individually, but
only the smallest eigenvalue (represented by the lowest curve in orange color) matters as

it determines whether we can satisfy the constraint that all eigenvalues are positive. In
Fig. (6), we zoom in to the small allowed range for the parameter ˆId
2,1. The allowed region,
as shown in the plot, is
0.7598≤ˆId=4
2,1≤0.7610 , (2.48)
which tightly constrains ˆId=4
2,1around its true value ˆId=4
2,1≈0.7603from evaluating the
known analytic result at d= 4, M2=−p2= 2, with a relative error of around 10−3.
The above two-sided bounds are rigorous, but we will also explore a prescription to
assign a “central value”, or “best estimate”, of the value of the integrals. The prescription
described below, though not justified from first principles, empirically achieve a closer
agreement with true values of the integrals than the rigorous bounds in the examples in
this paper. The prescription is simply finding the value of ˆId
2,1which maximizes the smallest
eigenvalue of the matrix that is required to be positive semidefinite, e.g. the matrix fMof
Eq. (2.41). For the positivity constraint Eq. (2.47) with 10 free parameters, the prescription
picks the value of ˆId
2,1corresponding to the maximum of the curve in Fig. 6, which deviates
from the exact result, again at the example point d= 4, m= 1, M2=−p2= 2, by only
a relative error of about 10−6. In this case, the prescription happens to produce a value
that is very close to the exact result, but typically we observe the prescription to give a
“central value” that is one to two orders of magnitude better than the accuracy indicated
by rigorous bounds.
– 11 –2.2.3 High-precision evaluation using semidefinite programming
We have formulated positivity constraints in terms of eigenvalues of a matrix which, in the
toy example of the one-loop bubble integrals, depends linearly on only one undetermined
parameter, as shown in Eq. (2.42). For more complicated Feynman integrals, there will
be more than one master integrals to be evaluated and all of them will be considered as
undetermined parameters. So a search in higher-dimensional space is needed to locate the
region in which all eigenvalues of the matrix are non-negative, and this can become com-
putationally challenging. Fortunately, very efficient algorithms exist to solve semidefinite
programming problems in mathematical optimization [54]. Loosely speaking, semidefinite
programs are generalizations of linear programs allowing not only linear constraints but
also positive semidefiniteness constraints on matrices that have linear dependence on the
optimization variables. Here we show how our problem of constraining unknown master
integrals can be stated as semidefinite programming problems. Following the treatment of
Section 2.2.2 above, finding the minimum allowed value of ˆId
2,1can be formulated as
minimize ˆId
2,1,
subject to M1+ˆId
2,1·M2≽0,(2.49)
which is in the form of a semidefinite program. We used the ≽0notation, already intro-
duced in Eq. (2.39), to indicate that the matrix on the LHS must be positive semidefinite.
Similarly, finding the maximum allowed value of ˆId
2,1can be formulated as
maximize ˆId
2,1,
subject to M1+ˆId
2,1·M2≽0.(2.50)
Finally, to implement our prescription of maximizing the smallest eigenvalue to find the
“central value” of the undetermined master integrals, we introduce an additional undeter-
mined parameter λand formulate the problem as
maximize λ ,
subject to M1+ˆId
2,1·M2−λI≽0.(2.51)
This is again in the form of a semidefinite program, where both ˆId
2,1andλare undetermined
parameters whose values will be fixed to satisfy the optimization objective, namely to
maximize λ. Note that in this case, finding a optimal solution to the semidefinite program
does not guarantee M1+ˆId
2,1·M2≽0,unlessthe value of λin the solution is non-negative.
The value of ˆId
2,1in the solution is then taken as the central value for this undetermined
free parameter.
There exist many computer codes that specialize in solving semidefinite programs.
Wolfram Mathematica has supported semidefinite programming since version 12 with the
SemidefiniteOptimization function, and the default backend (which can be changed by
theMethodoption) is the open source library CSDP [66] at least for the problems we deal
with, working with double-precision floating numbers, i.e. the standard machine precision
on current hardware. The SDPA family [67] of computer programs support computation at
– 12 –doubleprecisionaswellasavarietyofextendedprecisions, e.g.double-doubleprecisionwith
SDPA-DD,quadruple-doubleprecisionwithSDPA-QD,andarbitraryprecisionwithSDPA-
GMP. The SDPB solver by Simmons-Duffin [68] specializes in polynomial programming
problems in the conformal bootstrap and works in arbitrary precision. Most of the work
in this paper will make use of the SDPA family, while some results from Mathematica /
CSDP will also be shown for the purpose of comparison.
We go on to discuss how to achieve higher numerical precision for the one-loop bubble
integral. We enlarge the ansatz for positive integrals in Eqs. (2.36) and (2.47) to have more
parameters, as
0<ZddleγEϵ
iπd/21
ρ2
1ρ2P(1/ρ1,1/ρ2)2, (2.52)
where P is an arbitrary polynomial with a maximum degree N, i.e. an arbitrary linear sum
of all monomials in 1/ρ1and1/ρ2, with each monomial multiplied by a free parameter αi.
TheN= 1andN= 3cases are shown previously in Eqs. (2.36) and (2.47), respectively.
Generally, the number of possible monomials in two variables with maximum degree Nis
equal to (N+ 1)( N+ 2)/2. For each value of Nfrom 1 to 10, we again set ˆId
2,1=I2,1/I3,0
atd= 4, m= 1, M2=−p2= 2and solve the semidefinite programs in Eqs. (2.49) to (2.51)
to obtain the lower bound (ˆId
2,1)min, upper bound (ˆId
2,1)max, and central value (ˆId
2,1)central
for the undetermined parameter ˆId
2,1. To ensure numerical stability, we use the SDPA-DD
solverworkingatdouble-doubleprecision. Thenwecomparewiththeexactresult (ˆId

In Fig. 7, we plot the relative errors against the cutoff degree Nof the polynomial Pin
Eq. (2.52). The plot is on a log scale, and we can see that the numerical results appear
to converge exponentially to the true value, reaching a precision as high as 10−14with a
cutoff degree of 10. The central value from our somewhat arbitrary prescription is seen to
be consistently more precise than the rigorous bounds.
We revisit the issue of numerical stability. In Fig. 8, we compare the accuracy obtained
for the central values obtained by SDPA-DD with double-double precision, which was used
above, and Mathematica / CSDP with double precision. The two results visibly deviate
from each other once the cutoff degree is 5 or above, and only the double-double precision
computation continues to exhibit exponential reduction in errors as the cutoff degree is
increased. This signals that numerical instability has occurred if one computes at double
precisiononly. Wehave checkedthat theaccuraciesdo notimprove further whencomputing
with quadruple-double precision using SDPA-QD.

bounds and Eq. (2.53) for the central values.

to improve exponentially beyond a cutoff degree of 5.
2.3 Positivity constraints in Feynman parameter space
In Section 2.2, we used positivity constraints in loop momentum space to evaluate bubble
integrals defined in Eq. (2.1) in the case p2<0when it is possible to Wick-rotate the inte-
grals into Euclidean spacetime with real-valued external momenta. We now use positivity
constrains in Feynman parameter space instead to evaluate bubble integrals for any value
ofp2less than 4m2, which is what is commonly referred to as the “Euclidean region” where
the bubble integrals have no imaginary parts. We write down the Feynman parameter
– 14 –representation of bubble integrals defined in Eq. (2.1),

tion, printed again here:
U(x1, x2) =x1+x2,F(x1, x2) =m2(x1+x2)2−p2x1x2−i0+.(2.57)
In the last line of Eq. (2.56), we integrated x2over the delta function in Eq. (2.55) to arrive
at Eq. (2.56) with
F(x)≡ F(x,1−x) =m2−p2x(1−x)−i0+, (2.58)
and
U(x)≡ U(x,1−x)≡1, (2.59)
which appears as a unit numerator in Eq. (2.56).
Aside:we note that Eq. (2.55) has the property that when ignoring the Dirac delta
function δ(1−P
ixi), the rest of the expression (with the integration measure taken into
account) is invariant under the rescaling
xi→λxi, (2.60)
where λis an arbitrary nonzero real number. This is called projective invariance and holds
for the Feynman parameter form of arbitrary Feynman integrals written down in Eq. (2.80).
The deeper reason is that Feynman parameter integrals can generally be written as integrals
in real projective space RPN−1(see e.g. Section 2.5.3 of Ref. [31]). RPN−1is the space of N
real coordinates xi, excluding the origin, where any ray, i.e. a set of points related to each
other by a rescaling Eq. (2.60), is identified as the same point. Abusing the language of
gauge theory, Eq. (2.60) is a gauge symmetry and δ(1−P
ixi)in Eq. (2.55) is a gauge-fixing
term that restricts the integration to one of the infinitely many gauge-equivalent slices. The
Fadeev-Popov Jacobian associated with this gauge-fixing term is unity and therefore does
not appear explicitly. Projective invariance is not a prerequisite for following the rest of
the paper, though it helps motivate some of the developments.
Now we specialize to the following kinematic region for bubble integrals,
0< p2<4m2, (2.61)
– 15 –i.e. with the value of p2below the Cutkosky cut threshold but cannot be trivially Wick-
rotated into Euclidean spacetime. We have
m2−p2x(1−x)≥m2−p2/4>0, (2.62)
so the −i0+prescription in Eq. (2.58) is negligible and can be dropped, and the integral
is real. For the rest of the paper, we will adopt the common terminology of the Euclidean
region to be the kinematic region in which all graph polynomials are non-negative and the
Feynman integral is real-valued due to the lack of Cutkosky cuts. Generally such integrals
cannot be embedded into Euclidean spacetime. This is e.g. the working definition when the
literature refers to the Euclidean region of Feynman integrals with massless external legs,
since nonzero massless momenta cannot be literally embedded into Euclidean spacetime.
If we set a2= 1, we can invert Eq. (2.56) to obtain

It will be more useful to have a version of the above equation with a fixed exponent
forF(x)on the LHS, even when the value of a1changes. Below is a version with a fixed
exponent d/2−3forF(x), obtained by replacing d→d+ 2(a1−2)in Eq. (2.63) and
multiplying by a constant prefactor,

where the last line used the explicit result for Id
3,0in Eq. (A.6). We define
ˆF(x) =F(x)/m2= 1−p2x(1−x)/m2, (2.65)
and rewrite Eq. (2.64) as
2Z1
0dx xa1−1 1
ˆF(x)3−d/2=Id+2a1−4
a1,1 /Id
3,0. (2.66)
The RHS of Eq. (2.66) can be simplified further, as IBP identities and dimension-shifting
identities can be applied to reduce Id+2a1−4
a1,1to a linear combination of the two master
integrals, Id
2,1andId
3,0. We will only use Eq. (2.66) in the case a1≥2, when the RHS
– 16 –involves a bubble integral in spacetime dimension greater than or equal to d= 4−2ϵ. As
an example, consider the case a1= 3, and Eq. (2.66) becomes
2Z1
0dx x2 1
ˆF(x)3−d/2=Id+2
3,1/Id

(2.68)
Finally, applying dimension-shifting identities Eqs. (2.22) and (2.23), the above equation

This concludes our example for simplifying the RHS of Eq. (2.66) in the case of a1= 3. We
now formulate a first version of positivity constraints for any d <6, to be improved upon
later, as,
0≤2Z1
0dx xP (x)2 1
ˆF(x)3−d/2, (2.70)
where P(x)is an arbitrary polynomial in x, which is analogous to the arbitrary polynomial
P(1/ρ1,1/ρ2)in Eq. (2.52) used to construct positive integrals in momentum space. In the
special case P(x) = 1, the RHS of Eq. (2.70) is simply proportional to Id
2,1in unshifted
spacetime dimension d, according to Eq. (2.66). Since xis non-negative in the range of
integration 0≤x≤1,xP(x)2is non-negative. We have chosen to use xP(x)2instead of
justP(x)2to ensure that each monomial in the expanded expression contains at least one
power of xand is related to an ultraviolet convergent integral in Eq. (2.66) as discussed
above. Another valid choice is (1−x)P(x)2, but this will not give more constraints for
the bubble integral, because in Eq. (2.56), F(x) =p2−m2x(1−x)is invariant under the
exchange x↔1−x, owing to a reflection symmetry of the bubble diagram.
It is possible to slightly refine the inequality Eq. (2.70) to make the constraint stronger.
As we assume p2>0, we have
F(x) =m2−p2x(1−x)< m2,ˆF(x) =F(x)/m2<1. (2.71)
So for any d <6, we can modify Eq. (2.70) with an extra term,

,(2.73)
but we will use the form Eq. (2.72) below.
To be more concrete, in Eq. (2.72), we use
P(x) =α1+α2x2+···+αNxN, (2.74)
where Nis the cutoff degree of the polynomial and αiwith 1≤i≤Nare free parameters,
and Eq. (2.72) must hold for any values of the αiparameters. For each monomial from
expanding xP(x)2, the first term in the curly bracket of Eq. (2.72) gives a bubble integral in
a shifted dimension, normalized against the tadpole integral Id
3,0, according to the formula
Eq.(2.66), whilethesecondterminthecurlybracketofEq.(2.72)contributestoanintegral
of a monomial in xover0≤x≤1which can be evaluated trivially. Using both dimension
shifting identities and IBP identities, the bubble integrals produced above are rewritten as
linear combinations of finite master integrals Eq. (2.9). Therefore Eq. (2.72) is turned into
the form
⃗ αTM⃗ α≥0, (2.75)
similar to the momentum-space version Eq. (2.36), with
M=M1+ˆId
2,1M2, (2.76)
where we use the definition ˆId
2,1=Id
2,1/Id
3,0as before, and the “inhomogeneous” term M1
receives contribution from both constant terms in Eq. (2.72) and tadpole integrals coming
from dimension-shifting and IBP identities. Following analogous developments in Sections
2.2.2 and 2.2.3, we solve the constraint

As an example, we pick numerical values

central value for ˆId

on the log-scale plot that the numerical result again converge exponentially to the exact
result as the cutoff degree is increased. In particular, with cutoff degree N= 14, the
numerical result is
ˆId=4

p2=2, m=1≈1.57079632679413 , (2.79)
which is slightly smaller than the exact result, with a relative error of 4.9×10−13.
2.4 Constraints for expansions in dimensional regularization parameter
The methods described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 are applicable to fixed spacetime dimensions,
i.e.d= 4−2ϵwith fixed values of ϵ, which can be 0 if we target the 4-dimensional case,
or any value larger than (−1)which will preserve the ultraviolet convergence properties
of the integrals involved in the text above. However, for practical applications, Feynman
integrals typically need to be evaluated as a Laurent expansion in ϵ. In the examples given
in this paper, we can choose master integrals which are finite as ϵ→0, so the task is to
calculation their Taylor expansions in ϵ. Any divergent integral can be reduced to rational-
linear combinations of the master integrals, with all divergences absorbed into ϵpoles of
the coefficients.1
We now present two strategies for calculating the ϵexpansion, using the one-loop bub-
ble integral example. The first strategy presented below is directly formulating positivity
constraints for the ϵexpansion terms, and the second strategy presented is numerical dif-
ferentiation of the results with respect to ϵaround ϵ= 0.
1In fact, it is believed that in general, one can choose “quasi-finite” master integrals [56] which are
convergent as ϵ→0except for a possible 1/ϵpole that appears as an overall prefactor in the Feynman
parameter representation.

We will restrict our attentions to values of dandaiunder which the RHS of Eq. (2.81) is

master integrals which are usually chosen to have small values of ai. We set

The matrix is in a special form called a Hankel matrix, where all matrix entries are defined
through a sequence H0,H1, ..., HN. Hankel matrices have also appeared in the context
of EFT positivity bounds, e.g. in Ref. [39].
Eq. (2.87) is extremely general and applies to any convergent Feynman integral (or
quasi-finite Feynman integral [56] after dropping an overall divergent prefactor) in the
Euclidean region with arbitrary powers of propagators and no numerators. This tells us
that the ϵexpansion of such Feynman integrals are not arbitrary but are constrained by
positivity constraints which, to our best knowledge, have not been previously revealed in

From Eq. (2.84), it is not hard to anticipate that more specialized positivity constraints
exist if we focus on a particular family of Feynman integrals if log(UL+1/Fl)has either an
upper bound or lower bound, or both, in the range of integration. For example, for one-loop
bubble integrals, the Upolynomial is equal to x1+x2and is set to 1 by the Dirac delta
function in Eq. (2.80). So we recover the Feynman parametrization for the one-loop bubble
integral, Eq. (2.56), with x1=x, x 2= 1−x,U(x) = 1 ,F(x) =m2−p2x(1−x). We have,
for0< p2<4m2under consideration, in the integration range 0≤x≤1,
logUL+1
FL= log1
F= log1
m2−p2x(1−x)≤log1
m2−p2/4≡log maxUL+1
FL.(2.88)
Therefore
log maxUL+1
FL−logUL+1
FL(2.89)
is a positive quantity. Similarly, if a minimum of logUL+1/FLexists over the range of
integration, then
logUL+1
FL−log minUL+1
FL(2.90)
– 21 –is a positive quantity. In the bubble integral example, again under 0< p2<4m2and
0≤x≤1,
logUL+1
FL= log1
F= log1
m2−p2x(1−x)≥log1
m2≡log minUL+1
FL. (2.91)
Now we show an example of using Eq. (2.88) to contrain the O(ϵ)term in the expansion
of the finite bubble integral I2,1, in the style of an ad hoc constraint as was done for the
O(ϵ0)part in Section 2.2.1.2Using the definition ˆF(x) =F(x)/m2in Eq. (2.65), Eq. (2.88)
is rewritten as
log1
ˆF(x)≤log max1
F= log1
1−p2/(4m2), (2.92)
i.e.,
log1
1−p2/(4m2)−log1
ˆF(x)≥0, (2.93)
We expand both the LHS and RHS of Eq. (2.69), with d= 4−2ϵ, as a Taylor series in ϵ.
Equating the ϵ0terms gives

ˆF(x)=p2−2m2

We plot the RHS of Eq. (2.97) versus p2/m2in Fig. 10. We can see that it is indeed
non-negative in the range 0< p2/m2<4.
2.4.3 Bubble integral up to second order in ϵ
We proceed to combine positivity constraints for ϵexpansion coefficients covered in Sections
2.4.1 and 2.4.2 with the semidefinite programming technique already used in Sections 2.2
and 2.3, in order to obtain high-precision results for the ϵexpansion of the bubble integral.
2It is also possible to use Eq. (2.91) instead, or in combination.
– 22 –Figure 10 . The RHS of Eq. (2.97) versus p2/m2in the range of validity 0< p2<4.
Recall that we evaluated the O(ϵ0)part, i.e. the d= 4result, for the bubble integral
starting from Eq. (2.70) and the refined version Eq. (2.72). For simplicity, we will build
upon the first version, Eq. (2.70), and use the additional positive building block Eq. (2.93)
to write down the following positivity constraint at d=d0−2ϵ= 4−2ϵ,
0≤Z1

,
(2.99)
where P(x)is again an arbitrary polynomial in x, and we are free to choose the maximum
degree of monomials that are included, depending on the accuracy we would like to attain.
After expanding P(x)2into a sum of monomials, the contribution from each monomial can
be evaluated following the same procedure as used in the example in Section 2.4.2. In
particular, the result will be a sum of terms proportional to ˆI2,1
ϵ0, terms proportional to
ˆI2,1
ϵ1, and constant terms. The remaining calculation steps are very similar to those of
Section 2.3. Re-using the parametrization Eq. (2.74) for the polynomial Pwith a cutoff
degree N= 14, we again arrive at
⃗ αTM⃗ α≥0, (2.100)
stating that an appropriate matrix Mis positive semidefinite, i.e.
M≽0. (2.101)
In this case, Mis a sum of three terms,
M=M1+I2,1
ϵ0·M2+I2,1
ϵ1·M3. (2.102)
where the three matrices M1,2,3, with rational dependence on p2andm, are obtained
from dimension shifting, IBP, and finally ϵ-expansion as in the example of Section 2.4.2.
We approximate I2,1
ϵ0to be the central value Eq. (2.79) obtained in the previous d=
4calculation with the same cutoff degree N= 14. At this point, I2,1
ϵ1remains the
only unknown parameter on the RHS of Eq. (2.102), and its allowed range as well as the
– 23 –central value can be determined by semidefinite programming solvers as covered in previous
sections. We again use SDPA-QD to produce the “central value” for the numerical result,
defined by the same prescription as before, obtaining
I2,1
ϵ1≈0.74313814320586 ,atp2= 2, m= 1, (2.103)
which is slightly larger than the exact result with a relative error of 4.3×10−12.
We continue to present how the O(ϵ2)term of the bubble integral is calculated. We
use the positivity constraint,

. (2.105)
We use N1= 14andN2= 1, so that there are at most 14 power of xinP(x)and at most
one power of log[1/ˆF(x)]. After expanding the P2, there are at most two powers of the
aforementioned logarithm, therefore there are ϵexpansions coefficients at orders ϵ0,ϵ1, and
ϵ2. We obtain an expression of the form
⃗ αTM⃗ α≥0, (2.106)
where the column vector ⃗ αgroups together all the αi1,i2parameters. The matrix Mis
the sum of a constant term, a term proportional to I2,1
ϵ0, a term proportional to I2,1
ϵ1,
and finally a term proportional to I2,1
ϵ2. We use previous numerical results for I2,1
ϵ0and
I2,1
ϵ1, and solve a semidefinite programming problem to find the central value of I2,1
ϵ2to
be
I2,1
ϵ2≈0.208108744452 ,atp2= 2, m= 1, (2.107)
which is slightly larger than the exact result with a relative error of 1.9×10−11.
There is no obstruction to obtaining results at even higher orders in the ϵexpansion
for the bubble integral example. Generally, we calculate iteratively to higher and higher
orders in ϵ, at each step taking previous numerical results as known input. The positivity
constraint is Eq. (2.104) with an appropriate cutoff degree for log[1/ˆF(x)]depending on
the desired order in the ϵexpansion. The RHS of Eq. (2.104) can be optionally multiplied
by either Eq. (2.89) or Eq. (2.90), with U= 1andL= 1in the case of bubble integrals,
to give more constraints. This will produce constraints for bubble integrals to any desired
order in the ϵexpansion.
2.5 ϵexpansion from numerical differentiation w.r.t. spacetime dimension
Here we present an alternative method for numerically evaluating the ϵ-expansion of the
normalized bubble integral ˆId
2,1defined in Eq. (2.13). Instead of formulating constraints
– 24 –for the ϵexpansion coefficients, we calculate the ˆId
2,1at numerical values of the spacetime
dimension near 4, and use finite-difference approximations to obtain derivatives w.r.t. ϵ.
The derivatives are related to the terms in the ϵexpansion via
ˆI2,1
ϵk=1

, (2.110)
where ∆ϵis the step size. As the name suggests, these formulas are exact when fis a
polynomial with a degree up to 4. Note that the method of Section 2.3 can be used to
evaluate the normalized bubble integral ˆId
2,1in any spacetime dimension d <6, i.e. ϵ >−1,
so Eqs. (2.109) and (2.110) can be readily used with ϵ0= 0and a small ∆ϵ, chosen to be
∆ϵ= 10−3. (2.111)
We again choose kinematic parameter values p2= 2andm= 1. The final results from
numerical differentiation, up to the second order in ϵ, are
ˆI2,1
ϵ1≈0.7431381432049 , (2.112)
which is slightly larger than the exact result with a relative error of 3.2×10−12, and
ˆI2,1
ϵ2≈0.20810874450 , (2.113)
which is slightly larger than the exact result with a relative error of 2.8×10−10.
3 Three-loop banana integrals with unequal masses
3.1 Definitions and conventions
Here we present a three-loop example, the so called banana integrals. Banana integrals
are various loop orders have received intense interest from an analytic perspective due to
connections with Calabi-Yau manifold [69–75]. We apply our numerical method developed
in the previous section 2 on one-loop bubble integrals, with some minor adaptations, to
evaluate 11nontrivial master integrals for the banana diagram. We assume the readers
to be familiar with the previous section as many shared techniques will not be introduced
again. ThediagramfortheintegralsisshowninFig.11. Duetodimension-shiftingidentities

reviewed in Section 2.1, the ϵexpansions of integrals in d= 4−2ϵandd= 2−2ϵcan be
related to each other. We will always use
d= 2−2ϵ , (3.1)
for three-loop banana integrals, which is convenient as the scalar integral has no ultraviolet
divergence in this spacetime dimension. The banana family of integrals is defined as

We have suppressed the ddependence on the LHS of the above equation, unlike the one-
loop case Eq. (2.1), since we will not make use of dimension-shifting in the treatment of
three-loop banana integrals and will exclusively work with d= 2−2ϵ. If any one of the four
indices aiis non-positive in Eq. (3.2), the remaining propagators have the structure of three
one-loop massive tadpole integrals. For example, if a4= 0, Eq. (3.2) clearly factorizes into
the product of three scalar tadpole integrals. For facilitating the discussion of positivity
constraints, it will be convenient to define a variant of Eq. (3.2) with slightly adjusted
constant factors,

By IBP reduction, all integrals of the banana family, with integer values of aiin
Eq. (3.3), can be expressed as linear sums of 15 master integrals. Publicly available soft-
ware, such as those presented Refs. [59–65], can be used to give a list of master integrals as
well as performing the actual IBP reduction of integrals. There are 11 nontrivial “top-level”
master integrals that are not products of tadpole integrals, shown in three groups below
according to the total number of the four indices,
ˆI1,1,2,2,ˆI1,2,1,2,ˆI1,2,2,1,ˆI2,1,1,2,ˆI2,1,2,1,ˆI2,2,1,1,

master integrals are chosen as

Each of these four master integrals is a product of three one-loop tadpole integrals given in

The values of the 11 remaining master integrals in Eq. (3.4) will be calculated numerically
from positivity constraints. We will work with kinematic variables in the range
p2<(m1+m2+m3+m4)2, (3.7)
i.e.belowtheparticleproductionthreshold, whichensuresthattheintegralsarereal-valued.
Similar to the case of one-loop bubble integrals, when the chosen value of p2is non-negative,
we cannot embed the integrals into Euclidean momentum space and need to use Feynman-
parameter space to formulate positivity constraints. The Feynman parametrization fol-
lows from the general formula Eq. (2.80) with adjustment of constant factors according to
Eq. (3.3),

Note that we have

in the integration region of Eq. (3.8), i.e. xi≥0,P
ixi= 1. This will help us formulate
positivity constraints. As in the one-loop bubble case, except for the “gauge fixing” Dirac
delta function, the rest of Eq. (3.8) has the projective invariance Eq. (2.60), as the Uand
Fpolynomials are homogeneously of degree 3 and 4, respectively.

which are invariant under the scaling Eq. (2.60). We rewrite Eq. (3.8) as

F(xi)4−3d/2, (3.14)
which is compatible with the projective invariance Eq. (2.60). After expanding the poly-
nomial Q(˜xi)into a sum of monomials, the contribution of each monomialQ
i˜xai−1
ican
be written as some ˆIa1,a2,a3,a4multiplied by a prefactor that is rational in d, according to
Eq. (3.12). All such integrals are UV convergent by power counting and also IR convergent
due to internal masses. No change of spacetime dimensions is involved, unlike the treatment
of one-loop bubble integrals in Section 2.3.
We consider the following choices of Q(˜xi), with the help of an arbitrary polynomial
P(˜xi)under a chosen maximum degree,
choice 1: Q(˜xi) =P(˜xi)2, (3.15)
choice 2: Q(˜xi) = ˜x1P(˜xi)2, (3.16)
choice 3: Q(˜xi) = ˜x2P(˜xi)2, (3.17)
choice 4: Q(˜xi) = ˜x3P(˜xi)2, (3.18)
choice 5: Q(˜xi) = ˜x4P(˜xi)2. (3.19)
With any of the above five choices for Q(˜xi)and with any choice of P(˜xi), the inequality
Eq. (3.14) must hold. The general form of P(˜xi)is a sum of all monomials under a chosen
cutoff degree, each multiplied by an arbitrary coefficient. For example, if the cutoff degree
is 1, then P(˜xi)is parametrized as
cutoff degree 1: P(˜xi) =α0,0,0,0+α1,0,0,0˜x1+α0,1,0,0˜x2+α0,0,1,0˜x3+α0,0,0,1˜x4.(3.20)

where the number of free parameters αi1,i2,i3,i4is equal to N+4

by combinatorics.
Since we have already discussed how to set up semidefinite optimization programs in
the context of one-loop bubble integrals, we will be brief in covering the analogous steps
here. Grouping the αi1,i2,i3,i4parameters into a column vector ⃗ αof length N+4

, the five
choices of Q, Eqs. (3.15) to (3.19), lead to
(⃗ α)TM(1)⃗ α≥0,(⃗ α)TM(2)⃗ α≥0,(⃗ α)TM(3)⃗ α≥0,
(⃗ α)TM(4)⃗ α≥0,(⃗ α)TM(5)⃗ α≥0, (3.22)
respectively, for any values of the vector α. For reasons we do not fully understand, the
first constraint (⃗ α)TM(1)⃗ α≥0leads to poor numerical convergence and is discarded. The
remaining four constraints are rewritten asrequiring the matrices to be positive semidefinite
using the notation Eq.(2.39),
M(2)≽0,M(3)≽0,M(4)≽0,M(5)≽0. (3.23)
For convenience, this can be rephrased as the positive semidefiniteness of a single matrix
which contains the above four matrices as diagonal blocks,
M=
M(2)0 0 0
0M(3)0 0
0 0 M(4)0
0 0 0 M(5)
≽0. (3.24)
Analogous to the case of one-loop bubble integrals, IBP reduction expresses Mas a
linear combination of the 15 master integrals in Eq. (3.4) and (3.5), each multiplied by a
matrix of rational functions in p2, m2
1, m2
2, m2
3, m2
4. It is necessary to perform IBP reduction
for banana integrals with up to 13 additional powers of propagators (beyond the standard
1st power), since the positive polynomial Qin Eqs. (3.16)-(3.19) bring 13 powers of xi
when Phas degree 6. The four master integrals in Eq. (3.5) are known analytically in
Eq. (3.6), and the values of the remaining 11 master integrals are unknown parameters to
be constrained by Eq. (3.24).
Before presenting numerical results, we also formulate positivity constraints for the ϵ
expansion of banana integrals. Recall that banana integrals in d= 2−2ϵ, normalized
according to Eq. (3.3), has a Feynman-parameter representation Eq. (3.12) using redefined
Feynman parameters in Eq. (3.11). For any integers ai≥1, Taylor-expanding both sides
– 29 –of Eq. (3.12) and equating the coefficients of the ϵkterm for any integer k, we have

By integration-by-parts reduction, the LHS of the above equation can be written as linear
combinations of the ϵexpansions of the 15 master integrals up to the ϵkorder, assuming
that the coefficients of the master integrals (from IBP reduction) are finite as ϵ→0, which
is the case here. Now we are ready to write down positivity constraints for the ϵexpansion

Eq. (3.29) with N2= 0, and to constrain the O(ϵ2)part, we will use Eq. (3.28) N2= 1.
For both O(ϵ1)andO(ϵ2)parts, N1will be chosen to be the same as the cutoff degree used
for the O(ϵ0)calculation.
3.3 Numerical results
We present numerical results for the 11 nontrivial master integrals of the banana family in
Eq. (3.4) at the following numerical values for kinematic variables,
p2= 2, m2
1= 2, m2
2= 3/2, m2
3= 4/3, m2
4= 1. (3.30)
– 30 –We remind readers that the spacetime dimension is set to
d= 2−2ϵ . (3.31)
As this paper is aimed at illustrating a new method, we have chosen example integrals
that are known to high precision in the existing literature. For three-loop banana integrals,
high precision results from series solutions to differential equations are available from the
DiffExp package [9]. In fact, we have chosen the same values for the masses in Eq. (3.30)
as the example in the aforementioned paper, though we chose a different value of p2as we
restrict to the Euclidean region Eq. (3.7). DiffExp is used to compute the master integrals
at the kinematic point Eq. (3.30) by solving ordinary differential equations along a line in
kinematic space parametrized by a variable x,
p2= 2, m2
1= 1 + x, m2
2= 1 + x/2, m2
3= 1 + x/3, m2
4= 1,(3.32)
subject to appropriate boundary conditions. The values of the master integrals at x= 1
are then the ones needed at the point Eq. (3.30). A precision of about 10−54is reached, and
the results are effectively taken as exact values for the purpose of validating our numerical
results.
For the values of the master integrals at O(ϵ0), i.e. in exactly d= 2, we will use
cutoff degrees of up to 6 in Eq. (3.21). Unlike the one-loop case in Section 2, we will not
fully characterize the allowed parameter region which is a sub-region of an 11-dimensional
parameter space and cannot be described by just a lower bound and an upper bound.
Instead, we will only compute the central values for the 11 undetermined master integrals.
Following the prescription laid out in Section 2, the central values are defined to maximize
the lowest eigenvalue of the matrix Min Eq. (3.24). With the largest cutoff degree 6,
there are 6+4
4
= 210free parameters in ⃗ α. Therefore, each of the four diagonal blocks in
Eq. (3.24) has size 210×210, and the full matrix Mhas size 840×840. We use SDPA-QD as
the semidefinite programming solver working at quadruple-double precision. The solver is
able to take advantage of the block diagonal structure of the matrix Mto improve efficiency.
In Fig. 12, we plot the relative errors of the central values of three representative master
integrals against the cutoff degree, for the O(ϵ0)order only. The actual results are given
later in Eq. (3.35) together with further terms in the ϵexpansion. The vertical axis of
the plot is on a logarithmic scale, and we can see that the results converge rapidly, in a
apparently exponential fashion, as the cutoff degree is raised. With the largest cutoff degree
6, each of the 11 master integrals is evaluated to an accuracy of at least 10−9.
For the values of master integrals at O(ϵ1). We will need the result for the parameter
values Eq. (3.30),
max 

≈5000/229059 , (3.33)
which we found by numerical maximization in Mathematica. To be conservative, we have
slighted rounded up the numerical result to a larger nearby rational number to guarantee
that the inequality Eq. (3.27) is true when using Eq. (3.33). This maximum value occurs
at
x1≈0.12222 , x 2≈0.22592 , x 3≈0.26701 , x 4≈0.38485 . (3.34)
– 31 –Figure 12 . Relative errors of the central values of three representative master integrals of the
banana family, versus the cutoff degree in the calculation.
While Eq. (3.33) will be used directly in calculations, Eq. (3.34) is only included for com-
pleteness. The normalization in Eq. (3.34) does not matter since U4/F3is invariant under
the scaling transformation Eq. (2.60).
Then the calculation is similar to the calculation of one-loop bubble interals to O(ϵ1)
in Section 2.4.3. We use the positivity constraint Eq. (3.26) with Eq. (3.29) for the positive
polynomial Q, taking the values k= 1,2,3,4and combining the constraints from the four
different choices. For the Ppolynomial in Eq. (3.29), we use a maximum total degree
N1= 6for the ˜xivariables and a maximum degree of 0for the logarithm, i.e. dropping any
terms involving the logarithm. The logarithm still appears in the bracket preceding P2in
Eq. (3.29) and contributes to O(ϵ)parts of integrals by Eq. (3.25). Using the O(ϵ0)results
as known inputs, we again solve a semidefinite programming problem involving a 840×840
matrix with four diagonal blocks, each of size 210×210, to obtain values for the O(ϵ1)
terms of the master integrals.
For the values of master integrals at O(ϵ2), we use the positivity constraint Eq. (3.26)
with Eq. (3.28) for the positive polynomial Q. We again use a maximum total degree
N1= 6for the ˜xivariables but now uses a maximum degree of 1for the logarithm. Since
the logarithm can appear in a monomial in Pwith either power 0 or power 1, the size of
the matrix in the semidefinite programming problem is doubled to 1680×1680, with four
diagonal blocks each of size 420×420. Taking both O(ϵ0)andO(ϵ1)results as known
inputs, we run SDPA-QD to find the central values for the O(ϵ2)results. For brevity, we
show results for 3 representative master integrals out of the 11 top-level master integrals,
– 32 –with kinematic variables taking values of Eq. (3.30),

For documenting the computational outputs, we have kept each number to 14 significant
figures, even their actual accuracies are lower as shown in plots in this section.
We have also calculated both O(ϵ1)andO(ϵ2)results using numerical differentiation
of integrals evaluated at fixed values of dimensions, following the same strategy of Section
2.5 for one-loop bubble integrals. The calculations are identical to the d= 2, i.e.O(ϵ0)
case and are based on Eq. (3.14) without any Taylor expansion in ϵ, with the only change
being that ϵis set to small numerical values different from 0, i.e. dis set to numerical values
that slightly deviate from 2. The 4th-order numerical differentiation formulas, Eqs. (2.109)
and Eq. (2.110) are applied with ϵ0= 0and∆ϵ= 10−3, with the spacetime dimension
d= 2−2ϵ. Example results from this alternative method are, again keeping each number
of 14 significant figures,
ˆI1122≈0.31328353052153 −0.12137519105424 ϵ−1.5576503067221 ϵ2,

Note that the O(ϵ0)results are copied from Eq. (3.35) as they are not re-calculated.
These numerical results for the ϵexpansion of master integrals Eq. (3.4) are obtained
with the normalization of Eq. (3.3). The reference results from DiffExp are have the nor-
malization of Eq. (3.2) and additional factors for individual master integrals. The reference
results have been converted to use our normalizations for comparison. DiffExp results for
the three sample integrals, truncated to 14 significant digits, are
ˆI1122≈0.31328353056677 −0.121375191032390 ϵ−1.5577067713048 ϵ2,

The final numerical accuracy for the 11 master integrals, with values of kinematic parame-
ters chosen in Eq. (3.30), is shown in Fig. 13. The ϵexpansion results from “direct positivity
constraints” are labeled consand results from numerical differentiation are labeled diff
in the plot legend. We can see that numerical differentiation gives very good accuracy for
O(ϵ1)terms, comparable with the accuracy of O(ϵ0)terms, while for the (ϵ2)terms, direct
positivity constraints yield more accurate results. In any case, both methods for the ϵ
expansion have demonstrated their potentials in this initial investigation, as all results for
O(ϵ1)terms have relative errors below 10−6and all results for O(ϵ2)terms have relative
errors below 10−3.
We now comment on computational resources used, when using the highest cutoff
degree 6. The computation times below are obtained without using multiple CPUs. IBP

reduction takes a few hours with FIRE6 [62] with numerical kinematics Eq. (3.30). The
IBP reduction results are obtained with analytic dependence on dand can be subsequently
expanded in ϵ, so no extra IBP reduction is needed for obtaining the ϵexpansions of master
integrals beyond the zeroth order. Running the semidefinite programming solver SDPA-
QD takes a few hours for every run, including one run for solving positivity constraints
for the O(ϵi)part for each i= 0,1,2, and for the alternative method based on numerical
differentiation, several runs at different numerical values of ϵto generate the data needed
to feed into finite-difference approximations.
Furthermore, Fig. 14 shows how the computation time depends on the cutoff degree
used for computing the ϵ0part of the master integrals. This is of interest since the cutoff
degree in turn controls the accuracy reached, c.f. Fig. 12). The computation time is broken
up into IBP reduction (with FIRE6) and the solving of the semidefinite program (with
SDPA-QD).3The size of each of the four diagonal blocks of the matrix Eq. (3.24) is equal
3For practical reasons, two different server machines were used. FIRE6 was run on a machine with
Intel Xeon E5-2697A v4, and SDPA-QD was run on a machine with Intel Xeon Gold 6130. While crude
testing indicates that the performance of the two machines are comparable, the essential information is in
the scaling behavior of each individual curve.

for a cutoff degree of k, due to the fact that there are 4propagators in the three-
loop banana diagram. For k= 3,4,5,6, the sizes are 35,70,126,210, respectively. The time
spent on solving the semidefinite program is very well described a cubic scaling with the
matrix size, while the IBP reduction time has a less steep growth as the cutoff degree is
raised.
To put the timing into context, we compare with numerical series solutions of differ-
ential equations with the DiffExp package, which generated the reference results in this
study. Constructing the differential equations via IBP reduction (with FIRE6) subject to
kinematics Eq. (3.32) and solving the differential equations (with DiffExp) took a total of
less than 18 minutes on a less powerful laptop computer, even though roughly five times
as many significant digits are reached compared with our results based on positivity con-
straints. Therefore, for this problem, our method is not competitive against differential
equations. However, it is worth noting that our method is in principle applicable to single-
scale integrals, such as vacuum integrals with uniform internal masses, without introducing
additional scales. Also, in more general cases, constructing differential equations requires
IBP reduction with analytic dependence on at least one kinematic variables, while our
method requires IBP reduction at one specific point in the space of kinematic variables,
even though more complicated integrals (e.g. with higher propagator powers) will need to
be reduced. Therefore, numerical and finite-field IBP reduction techniques (see e.g. [76–79])
can be potentially well suited for speeding up our computations in future studies.
4 Discussions
We have demonstrated a new method for evaluating Feynman integrals which, to our best
knowledge, is the first method based on inequality constraints, while previously exploited
consistency conditions for Feynman integrals are based on equality constraints (such as
the vanishing of the coefficient of a certain spurious singularity). Our calculation strat-
– 35 –egy is writing down an infinite class of convergent integrals with non-negative integrands
and reducing them to linear sums of a set of master integrals. This constraints an infi-
nite number of linear sums of master integrals to be non-negative. A truncated set of the
constraints can be solved as a semidefinite programming problem in mathematical opti-
mization. Surprisingly, the constraints appear strong enough to determine the integrals to
any desired precision since the bounds appear to converge exponentially as the truncation
cutoff is increased. Like the method of differential equations [80–84], our method relies on
integration-by-parts (IBP) identities, but instead of using differential equations to transport
the values of the integrals across kinematic space, we only use IBP information at a single
point in kinematic space.
Though our study is preliminary, the numerical results are promising. We have demon-
strated the applicability of our methods to a nontrivial example, namely three-loop banana
integrals with four unequal internal masses in d= 2−2ϵdimensions. With modest compu-
tational resources, we evaluated the O(ϵ0)part of all the 11 nontrivial master integrals to
a relative accuracy of at least 10−9. The accuracies for O(ϵ1)andO(ϵ2)terms are lower,
though only slightly so for O(ϵ1)terms when the numerical differentiation method is used.
For all but the smallest problems, extended-precision floating point arithmetic is needed to
ensure numerical stability in the semidefinite programming solver, similar to what was en-
countered in the conformal bootstrap [68] and the quantum mechanics bootstrap [49]. We
note that extended precision is also generally need in the evaluation of Feynman integrals
by series solutions of differential equations as observed in e.g. Refs. [8, 9].
We have also revealed hidden consistency relations that link different terms in the ϵ
expansions of Feynman integrals. As explained in Section 2.4.1, for any (quasi-) finite
Feynman integral without numerators, the ϵexpansion terms (appropriately normalized)
must give rise to a positive-semidefinite Hankel matrix. This is an extremely general state-
ment which can be checked against a huge number of Feynman integral computations in
the literature, because many Feynman integrals have Euclidean regions and it is believed
that a quasi-finite basis exist for any family of integrals [56]. This result is an elementary
consequence of our analysis but has not been previously exposed in the literature. Such
constraints have been solved numerically in our paper to predict the ϵexpansion terms to
high accuracy. We have also formulated an alternative method to obtain the ϵexpansion
terms by numerical differentiation of semidefinite programming solutions with respect to
the spacetime dimension. The above two methods for calculating ϵexpansion terms are
complementary and we have found cases in which either of them outperforms the other in
accuracy.
Our new method for calculating Feynman integrals is analogous to recent developments
in bootstrapping quantum mechanics systems and lattice models [45–47, 49–52]. For exam-
ple, theroleofIBPanddimensional-shiftingidentities inourworkisanalogoustotheroleof
moment recursion relations in the quantum mechanics bootstrap. Analogous identities also
appear in EFT bounds as “null constraints” from crossing symmetry [37].4While our work
has imported techniques developed in non-perturbative contexts to perturbative physics, in

– 36 –the reverse direction, the differential equation method of perturbative calculations has been
applied to non-perturbative lattice correlation functions in Refs. [85–87], also exploiting
identities similar to those from IBP. Therefore, we expect a fruitful exchange of techniques
between perturbative and non-perturbative calculations.
Finally, we speculate on possible future work. Except for the generic constraints on
theϵexpansion, this paper has mainly treated massive Feynman integrals, and for integral
families involving massless internal lines, it would be necessary to identify non-negative
integrals free of not only ultraviolet but also infrared divergences to generate the positivity
constraints. To extend our method to integrals outside the Euclidean region, it remains
to be seen how positivity constrains can be formulated, possibly for real and imaginary
parts separately after a suitable deformation of the integration contour. Connections with
other notions of positivity relevant for Feynman integrals [88, 89] remain to be explored.
Another interesting question is whether positivity constraints can be used to understand
complete scattering amplitudes (rather than individual Feynman integrals) at a fixed order
in perturbation theory, in light of numerical observations in N= 4super-Yang-Mills theory
amplitudes in Ref. [90].

A Analytic results for bubble integrals
The material here is well known in the literature but included for completeness. We work
in spacetime dimension d= 4−2ϵ. Using Feynman parametrization, Eq. (2.1) is written
as, for a1≥1, a2≥1.

This allows us to evaluate the first of the master integrals in Eq. (2.9) as

2,1 = Γ(1 + ϵ)(m2)−1−ϵeγEϵZ1

[1−x(1−x)p2/m2−i0+]1+ϵ(A.2)
Since the denominator in the above integrand is symmetric under x↔1−x, we can
symmetrize the numerator as x→[x+ (1−x)]/2 = 1 /2, obtaining
Id=4−2ϵ
2,1 = Γ(1 + ϵ)(m2)−1−ϵeγEϵZ1

The omitted O(ϵ)term in Eq. (A.3) is easy to evaluate and we do not include the explicit
result here. The second master integral in Eq. (2.9) is a trivial tadpole integral,
Id=4−2ϵ
3,0 =1
2Γ(3−d/2)eγE(4−d)/2(m2)−3+d/2=1

So the ratio defined in Eq. (2.13) is equal to, when d= 4−2ϵ,
ˆId=4−2ϵ
2,1 =Id=4−2ϵ

This result is real and positive for any p2<4m2, after taking into cancellation of imaginary
parts with the definition Eq. (A.5). The corrections at higher order in the dimensional
regularization parameter ϵare also readily obtained but we do not include the results here.
The tadpole integral with an arbitrary power for the propagator is well known,
