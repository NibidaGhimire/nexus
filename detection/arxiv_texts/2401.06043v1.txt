ABSTRACT
We present a JWST/NIRCam transmission spectrum from 3.9–5.0 µm of the recently-validated
sub-Earth GJ 341b (R P= 0.92 R⊕, Teq= 540 K) orbiting a nearby bright M1 star (d = 10 .4 pc,
Kmag= 5.6). We use three independent pipelines to reduce the data from the three JWST visits and
perform several tests to check for the significance of an atmosphere. Overall, our analysis does not
uncover evidence of an atmosphere. Our null hypothesis tests find that none of our pipelines’ trans-
mission spectra can rule out a flat line, although there is weak evidence for a Gaussian feature in two
spectra from different pipelines (at 2.3 and 2.9 σ). However, the candidate features are seen at different
wavelengths (4.3 µm vs 4.7 µm), and our retrieval analysis finds that different gas species can explain
these features in the two reductions (CO 2at 3.1σcompared to O 3at 2.9σ), suggesting that they are
not real astrophysical signals. Our forward model analysis rules out a low mean molecular weight
atmosphere ( <350×solar metallicity) to at least 3 σ, and disfavors CH 4-dominated atmospheres at
1−3σ, depending on the reduction. Instead, the forward models find our transmission spectra are
consistent with no atmosphere, a hazy atmosphere, or an atmosphere containing a species that does
not have prominent molecular bands across the NIRCam/F444W bandpass, such as a water-dominated
atmosphere. Our results demonstrate the unequivocal need for two or more transit observations ana-
lyzed with multiple reduction pipelines, alongside rigorous statistical tests, to determine the robustness
of molecular detections for small exoplanet atmospheres.

The M-dwarf opportunity is one of the most promis-
ing routes to measure the atmospheres of terrestrial, and
potentially habitable, exoplanets (e.g. Charbonneau &
Deming 2007). This opportunity arises from the fa-
vorable planet-to-star radius ratios, close-in habitable
zones, and frequent transits of rocky planets transiting
M dwarfs. However, the M-dwarf opportunity must con-
tend with the high and prolonged X-ray and EUV emis-
sion from M-dwarf host stars (e.g., Pizzolato et al. 2003;
Preibisch & Feigelson 2005; Shkolnik & Barman 2014;
Peacock et al. 2019), which could cause significant exo-
planet atmospheric loss (e.g., Lammer et al. 2003; Owen
& Jackson 2012; Owen & Mohanty 2016).
Indeed, atmosphere observations of terrestrial planets
(RP≤1.6 R⊕) around M dwarfs have so far revealed no
conclusive detections of atmospheres (e.g., de Wit et al.
2016, 2018; Wakeford et al. 2019; Diamond-Lowe et al.
2018, 2022; Kreidberg et al. 2019), with recent JWST
studies of TRAPPIST-1b and -c being consistent with
no, or minimal, atmospheres (Greene et al. 2023; Lim
et al. 2023; Zieba et al. 2023).
In order to assess the M-dwarf opportunity, it is nec-
essary to determine which, if any, terrestrial planets
around M dwarfs are capable of retaining an atmo-
sphere. One way to address this question is to determine
whether M dwarf exoplanets are separated by a ‘cosmic
shoreline’, a division in insolation–escape velocity space
(I–v esc) separating bodies with atmospheres from those
without (Zahnle & Catling 2017). In the Solar System,
Zahnle & Catling (2017) demonstrated that this divid-
ing line follows an I ∝vesc4relation.
Following the successful launch and commissioning of
JWST (Gardner et al. 2023; McElwain et al. 2023; Rigby
et al. 2023), we are now able to expand the I–v escparam-
eter space over which we can address the existence of a
cosmic shoreline to terrestrial planets around M-dwarf
stars. This is the focus of JWST program 1981 (PIs:
K. Stevenson and J. Lustig-Yaeger), which is obtaining
JWST transmission spectra of five exoplanets around M
dwarfs to determine whether a cosmic shoreline exists for
M-dwarf systems.
Our first study (Lustig-Yaeger & Fu et al. 2023b)
ruled out Earth-like, hydrogen/helium, water- and
methane-dominated clear atmospheres for the Earth-
sized exoplanet LHS 475b. This is consistent with pre-
dictions from the cosmic shoreline. This study also con-
firmed LHS 475b as a bona fide exoplanet, promoting it
from a planet candidate in parallel with the efforts of
Ment et al. (2023).
Our second study (Moran & Stevenson et al. 2023)
was of the super-Earth GJ 486b which sits close to the
shoreline predicted by Zahnle & Catling (2017) and thusprovides an important test of its existence. We ten-
tatively detected water in GJ 486b’s transmission spec-
trum, however, our NIRSpec/G395H observations could
not determine the origin of the water, be it in the
planet’s atmosphere or the stellar atmosphere.
Most recently, in May & MacDonald et al. 2023, we
observed two transits of the super-Earth GJ 1132b, an-
other planet near the shoreline. Our study revealed the
importance of multi-visit observations for small transit-
ing exoplanets, since one visit was suggestive of spectral
features while the other produced a flat transmission
spectrum. Given the inconsistent transmission spectra
between our two visits, we were unable to make a con-
clusive determination of the planet’s likely atmospheric
composition, although neither visit was consistent with
a previous report of HCN (Swain et al. 2021).
Here, we extend our program to GJ 341b (TOI
741.01), a planet that was recently validated by DiT-
omasso et al. (2023) and which orbits a nearby bright
M1 star ( K= 5.6, 10.4 pc, Gaia Collaboration et al.
2016, 2023). The TESS-derived planetary radius is
0.92±0.05 R⊕, making this a sub-Earth, with a 3 σupper
limit on the planet’s mass of 4.5 M ⊕(DiTomasso et al.
2023). The mass–radius relation of Chen & Kipping
(2017) gives a planet mass of 0 .72±0.14 M⊕. Assuming
a Bond albedo of zero and uniform heat redistribution,
the planet’s equilibrium temperature is 540 K, while its
irradiation temperature is 760 K. Given the planet’s es-
cape velocity of 10 km s−1, the cosmic shoreline relation
predicts that this planet has not retained a substantial
atmosphere. Our study seeks to test this prediction.
The paper is laid out as follows: in Section 2 we de-
scribe the observational setup. In Section 3 we explain
our data reduction and light curve fitting, using three in-
dependent pipelines. We present our transmission spec-
tra, flat line rejection tests, atmospheric forward models
and atmospheric retrievals in Section 4. We discuss our
results and present our conclusions in Section 5.
2.OBSERVATIONS
We observed three transits of GJ 341b across three vis-
its with JWST’s Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam, Rieke
et al. 2023) as part of GO program 1981 (PIs: K. Steven-
son and J. Lustig-Yaeger). Unlike the other GO 1981
targets that were observed with NIRSpec, NIRCam was
selected for GJ 341 because this bright star (K mag= 5.6)
saturates NIRSpec in one group. The three visits oc-
curred on March 2, March 10, and April 17, 2023 UT,
with each visit lasting 5.25 hours. We used the F444W
filter, covering a wavelength range from 3.8–5.1 µm at
a native spectral resolution of R≈1650, and the SUB-
GRISM128 subarray, giving us 2048 pixel columns andJWST/NIRCam transmission spectroscopy of GJ 341b 3
128 pixel rows. Given the brightness of our target, we
used 3 groups per integration and acquired 4652 inte-
grations during each of our three visits. The effective
integration time was 3.38 s.
3.DATA REDUCTION
As with the previous studies in our program (Lustig-
Yaeger & Fu et al. 2023b; Moran & Stevenson et al.
2023; May & MacDonald et al. 2023), we used three
different pipelines to reduce our data independently:
Eureka! ,Tiberius , and Tswift . We describe the ap-
proach taken with each pipeline in more detail below
and include a table in the appendix that summarizes
each pipeline’s approach (Table 6).
3.1. Eureka!
The Eureka! data reduction pipeline (Bell et al.
2022) is well established, with published JWST analy-
ses demonstrating reliable results from numerous obser-
vations (The JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community
Early Release Science Team et al. 2022; Ahrer et al.
2023; Alderson et al. 2023; Rustamkulov et al. 2023;
Lustig-Yaeger & Fu et al. 2023b; Moran & Stevenson et
al. 2023). As described below, we adopt similar meth-
ods for the analysis of GJ 341b.
Starting from the uncal.fits files, we masked a re-
gion within 30 pixels of the measured trace from pixel
column 640 to 2048. We then performed a double-
iteration, group-level background subtraction by first fit-
ting and removing the mean flux on a column-by-column
basis and, second, fitting and removing the mean flux
on a row-by-row basis. Unlike NIRSpec and NIRISS,
NIRCam detectors exhibit 1/f noise along pixel rows,
thus necessitating this additional row-by-row step. This
orientation of the 1/f noise is because NIRCam’s rapid
readout direction aligns with the wavelength dispersion
direction (Schlawin et al. 2020). In Stage 1, we skipped
the jump detection step because our observations only
had 3 groups per integration, which makes the jump
step unreliable. We processed the rateints.fits files
through the regular jwst Stage 2 pipeline.
In Stage 3, Eureka! performed a full-frame outlier
search with a 4 σrejection threshold. We then computed
a clean median frame and corrected the spectrum’s cur-
vature by rolling pixel columns to bring the trace to
the center of the detector. We skipped any additional
background subtraction and applied optimal spectral ex-
traction (Horne 1986) using an aperture that was within
3 pixels of the measured trace. We tested a range of
aperture sizes and found that a 3-pixel half-width min-
imized the white light curve residuals. To calculate our
wavelength solution, we used a polynomial from Flight
Program 1076 (E. Schlawin, private communication).We extracted the flux from 3.9–5.0 µm, splitting the
light into 55 spectroscopic channels, each 0.02 µm in
width. For each light curve, we applied a box-car filter
of length 50 integrations and flagged any 3.5 σoutliers.
This procedure removed <2% of all integrations for a
given light curve.
We fitted all three white light curves simultaneously.
We used batman (Kreidberg 2015) to fit the system pa-
rameters and fixed the quadratic limb-darkening coeffi-
cients to those provided by ExoTiC-LD (Grant & Wake-
ford 2022) from 3D stellar models (Magic et al. 2015).
For our stellar parameters, we used T eff= 3745 K and
logg= 4.71 g cm−2and assumed a solar metallicity
([Fe/H] = 0) (ExoMAST). Across the three visits, we
fitted for a single planet-star radius ratio ( RP/R∗), or-
bital inclination ( i), semi-major axis ( a/R∗), and transit
time ( T0). The period (P) was held fixed to 7.5768707
days (ExoMAST). For each visit, we fitted an indepen-
dent exponential times linear ramp model to account for
light curve systematics. We also renormalized the error
bars from each visit in order to achieve a reduced chi-
squared of unity. In total, there were 19 free parameters.
Table 1 lists our best-fit system parameters.
When fitting the spectroscopic light curves, we fixed
the orbital inclination, semi-major axis, and transit time
to the white light curve best-fit values. Again, we fixed
the quadratic limb-darkening parameters to the values
provided by ExoTiC-LD for each spectroscopic channel.
The planet-to-star radius ratio was the only physical free
parameter. For each spectroscopic channel, we fitted
an independent exponential times linear ramp model to
account for light curve systematics. Including the error
bar renormalization term, each spectroscopic fit had six
free parameters. For both the white and spectroscopic
light curves, we clipped the first 300 integrations from
each visit to avoid fitting the exponential decrease in
flux. Figure 1 shows our fits to the Eureka! white and
spectroscopic light curves, with the Allan variance plot
of the residuals shown in Figure 2.
3.2. Tiberius
The Tiberius reduction began with the uncalibrated
fits files ( uncal.fits ). We ran these through the stage
1 detector processing stages of the jwst pipeline. How-
ever, we did not perform the jump step as this has been
found to increase the noise in time series spectropho-
tometry (e.g., Rustamkulov et al. 2023). Furthermore,
unlike in the application of Tiberius to NIRSpec data
(e.g., Rustamkulov et al. 2023; Lustig-Yaeger & Fu et
al. 2023b; Moran & Stevenson et al. 2023) and in our
Eureka! reductions of the data presented here, we did
not apply a 1/f correction to the data. This is because4 Kirk et al.

the 1/f noise is parallel to the dispersion dimension for
NIRCam data, complicating its removal.
Following the stage 1 detector processing, we worked
with the integration level images ( gainscalestep.fits
files). While these were processed through the
gain scale step, the jwst pipeline does not apply a
gain correction if the default gain setting is used. For
this reason, we worked in units of DN/s throughout the
rest of our analysis. Since we work with normalizedlight curves, and rescale our photometric uncertainties,
the gain correction is not necessary.
Before extracting the stellar flux from each image,
each pixel was compared to the median value for that
pixel across the time series and >5σoutliers were re-
placed by the median for that pixel. We then oversam-
pled each pixel by a factor of 10 in the spatial dimension
using a flux-conserving interpolation, which allows us to
more precisely place the aperture boundaries. We found
this step to reduce white noise by 10 % in previous testsJWST/NIRCam transmission spectroscopy of GJ 341b 5

on JWST data (Rustamkulov et al. 2023). Next, we
traced the stellar spectrum using a fourth order poly-
nomial between columns 700 and 2042 (inclusive, zero-
indexed) and performed standard aperture extraction.
We subtracted the background at every column using
the median value across the full column, after masking
a total of 45 pixels centered on the stellar trace, and
summed up the stellar flux in an aperture with a full
width of 5 pixels. We experimented with wider apertures
and found these led to consistent transmission spectra
and light curves but with greater noise.
We fitted our white light curves from the three vis-
its simultaneously after subtracting one orbital period
(7.576863 days, DiTomasso et al. 2023) from transit 2’s
time array and six orbital periods from transit 3’s time
array so that all time arrays could be fitted with a single
T0, which corresponded to transit 1. The 16 free pa-
rameters in our white light curve fits were T0,i,a/R∗,
RP/R∗and the 12 parameters defining our systematics
model. We defined this model as a single component
exponential ramp multiplied by a linear-in-time poly-
nomial for each visit. The period was held fixed to
7.576863 days (DiTomasso et al. 2023). We used batman
(Kreidberg 2015) to generate our analytic transit light
curves.
For our limb darkening calculations, we adopted
Teff= 3770 ±40 K and log g= 4.72±0.02 g cm−2
(DiTomasso et al. 2023) and assumed a solar metallic-
ity ([Fe/H] = 0). We used a quadratic limb darkening
law with coefficients held fixed to values calculated from
3D stellar atmosphere models (Magic et al. 2015) usingExoTiC-LD (Grant & Wakeford 2022) and our own cus-
tom instrument throughput. This was constructed by
dividing our observed stellar spectrum by the appropri-
ate Phoenix model spectrum (Husser et al. 2013) and
smoothing the result with a running median, following
the approach of Alderson et al. (2023).
We explored the parameter space with a Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) using the emcee Python package
(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). We ran three sets of
chains each with 50,000 steps and 200 walkers. After
the first run, we discarded the first 25,000 steps and cal-
culated the median values from the second 25,000 steps
of our chains which were used as starting points for the
second run. After the second run, we again discarded
the first 25,000 steps and used the best-fitting model to
rescale our photometric uncertainties to give χ2
ν= 1.
Our third and final run used the rescaled photometric
uncertainties. The medians, 16th and 84th percentiles of
our posteriors from this third run are reported in Table
1. These posteriors were constructed after discarding
the first 100 steps and thinning by a factor of 10.
Our spectroscopic light curves were created using
57 20-pixel-wide wavelength bins between 3.906 and
5.004 µm and we adopted the same wavelength solu-
tion as used in the Eureka! reduction. For our spec-
troscopic light curve fits, we fixed the system param-
eters ( T0,ianda/R∗) to the Tiberius values in Ta-
ble 1 and fitted each visit independently, not jointly.
Prior to fitting, we divided each spectroscopic light curve
by a visit-dependent common noise model. This noise
model was defined as WLC v/tm vwhere WLC vis the
visit-dependent white light curve and tm vis the visit-
dependent best-fitting transit ( batman ) model. For our
spectroscopic light curves, the exponential coefficients
did not converge for every wavelength bin across each
visit, despite experimenting with different priors. For
this reason, at the spectroscopic light curve stage, we
clipped the first 600 integrations (40 minutes) from each
visit, after removing the common noise, and fitted the
light curves with a linear polynomial and no exponential.
This gave comparable residual red noise to the fits where
the exponential coefficients did converge, indicating that
the ramp was adequately removed by clipping the first
600 integrations. Figure 11 in the Appendix shows the
fits to our white and spectroscopic light curves, with
the Allan variance plot of the residual red noise from
our white light curve fits shown in Figure 2.
3.3. Tswift
Transit swift ( Tswift ) is a JWST data reduction
routine developed to swiftly analyze time-series obser-
vation of transiting exoplanet atmospheres. Starting6 Kirk et al.
from the uncal.fits images, we used the default jwst
pipeline with steps.jump turned off to produce stage
onerateints.fits images. Next, we performed row-
by-row and column-by-column background subtraction
(Schlawin et al. 2020) for each integration by subtracting
out the median of the non-illuminated regions from each
row. Next, we cross-correlated the spectral line spread
function with each column to determine the vertical po-
sition of the spectral trace for that column. We then
used a third-order polynomial to fit the vertical posi-
tion versus the column number, determining the spectral
trace location for each integration. The spectrum was
extracted using a full-width 6-pixel wide aperture cen-
tered on this polynomial fit as it minimizes the scatter in
the white light curve. Given the brief exposure time for
each integration and the high number of integrations per
visit, cosmic rays or hot pixels have a minimal impact
on the transit light curve. Furthermore, we identified
and discarded any outliers in time exceeding 5 σbased
on the transit light curve baseline scatter for each col-
umn. Finally, we combined all wavelength channels to
produce the white light curve of each transit.
The fitting of each individual white light curve em-
ploys a combination of batman (Kreidberg 2015) and
emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). This approach
incorporates eight parameters: T0,RP/R∗,a/R∗,i, a
linear time slope, a constant scaling factor, and two coef-
ficients for the exponential ramp. The averaged best-fit
parameters from the three white light curves are listed
in Table 1. To determine the quadratic limb darkening
parameters, we used the 3D stellar models (Magic et al.
2015) from the ExoTiC-LD (Grant & Wakeford 2022)
package and subsequently fixed both quadratic terms,
using the same stellar parameters as in the Eureka!
and Tiberius analyses. We tested fitting for the sec-
ond quadratic term while fixing the first one, and it had
no effect on the final transmission spectrum.
The NIRCam detector has four amplifiers and the
spectrum is dispersed across the second to fourth am-
plifier in the F444W observation mode (Schlawin et al.
2020). As already discussed, there is 1/f noise along
the dispersion direction in our NIRCam data. In an
ideal scenario, this noise could be subtracted if every
row in each amplifier had unilluminated pixels. How-
ever, due to the continuous dispersion of spectra across
various amplifiers, it is not feasible to correct the entire
spectrum. As a result, we observed lingering 1/f noise
residuals that showed correlation across wavelengths in
the light curve fits. We identified that these residual
patterns are predominantly consistent across all ampli-
fiers, with a few minor patterns unique to individual
amplifiers. To better remove this correlated noise, weperformed a white light fit within each amplifier, and
the residuals were then used as a common-mode correc-
tion during the spectroscopic light curve fits.
For our spectroscopic light curve fits, we used batman
andscipy.optimize.curvefit . The model consists of
five parameters: RP/R∗, a constant scaling factor, two
coefficients for the exponential ramp, and a scaling fac-
tor for the common-mode correction. We held T0,a/R∗,
andifixed to the corresponding averaged best-fit val-
ues from the white light curves (Table 1). Figure 12
shows our fits to the Tswift white and spectroscopic
light curves, with the Allan variance plot of the residu-
als shown in Figure 2.
3.4. Engineering parameters
As can be seen in the Allan variance plots from our
reductions (Figure 2) there is residual red noise which
becomes apparent at time scales longer than 1 minute.
In order to remove this red noise, we explored detrend-
ing our light curves with engineering telemetry data
timeseries from the JWST Engineering Database. The
telemetry data are identified by mnemonics, which fol-
low the naming convention X YZ, where X corresponds
to the system (I for Integrated Science Instrument Mod-
ule, S for spacecraft), Y corresponds to the subsystem,
instrument, controller, or component (1–4 letters), and
Z corresponds to the telemetry name (2–20 characters).
Throughout the rest of this section, we refer to these
timeseries telemetry data sets as ‘mnemonics’.
We began by whittling down the 6176 NIRCam-
related mnemonics to the 596 mnemonics of time-
varying floats (as opposed to booleans and non-varying
constants). We then resampled each mnemonic onto
the same time-sampling as each of our three visits
and proceeded to sequentially incorporate each of the
596 mnemnonics into our white light curve systematics
model, for the Tiberius reduction, to test whether the
addition of a mnemnonics model decreased the residual
red noise.
For these fits we used a Levenberg-Marquadt alo-
gorithm, with the systematics model being the summa-
tion of a linear polynomial describing the mnemonic and
a linear-in-time polynomial, after clipping the first 600
integrations. We then compared the residual red noise
in each case to our fiducial model: a linear-in-time poly-
nomial. We defined the residual red noise as being the
RMS of the residuals in bins of 200 integrations divided
by the white noise expectation (equivalent to dividing
the color lines in our Allan variance plots by the dashed
black lines at x= 14.5 mins, Figure 2). Of the 596 pos-
sible mnemonics, we found that 112 mnemonics led to a
decrease in the residual red noise compared to the fidu-JWST/NIRCam transmission spectroscopy of GJ 341b 7
cial model for all three visits. The ten mnemonics that
led to the largest decrease in the RMS are given in Ta-
ble 2. As shown in Table 2, these mnemonics mostly
correspond to temperature.
Following this test, we ran a second test where we in-
creased the number of mnemonics used to fit the white
light curves, going from one to ten mnemonics in the
order presented in Table 2. As can be seen in Figure
3, including additional mnemonics does not necessarily
lead to an improvement in the residual red noise. This
is likely due to some mnemonics representing similar
telemetry data (e.g., INRC FAPSC LVCBRD TEMP
and INRC FAPSC SCRBRD TEMP). This figure also
demonstrates that the use of a mnemonic significantly
improves the residual red noise in visit 2 while the
changes in visits 1 and 3 are more subtle. Addition-
ally, a combination of 10 mnemonics does not eradicate
the residual red noise. As a further test, we fitted all
596 mnemonics jointly with a linear-in-time polynomial.
In this case, the residual red noise was below the white
noise expectations. We interpreted this as evidence that
including a large number of mnemonics can lead to over-
fitting.
While independently fitting each visit’s light curve
with mnemonics demonstrated the residual red noise
could be improved upon, we ended up not using the
mnemonic data in our final white light curve fits. This
was because we could not obtain acceptable fits when we
tried to fit the three visits simultaneously with mnemon-
ics, likely due to the fact that the amplitude of the sys-
tematics in our data is comparable to the transit depth.
We advocate for a further exploration of mnemonics for
exoplanets with deeper transits where the transit and
systematics models are less degenerate.
3.5. Short wavelength photometry
Since our observations were conducted with NIRCam,
we additionally have access to the short wavelength
(SW) channel between 0.6–2.3 µm. This channel ac-
quired photometry simultaneously with the long wave-
length spectroscopy described above. We extracted the
short wavelength photometry using Tiberius to deter-
mine whether we could use these additional white light
curves to improve the precision of our system parame-
ters.
As with the long wavelength data, we began by pro-
cessing the uncal.fits files through stage 1 of the jwst
pipeline. We then extracted the time-series photometry
using Tiberius with an aperture 100 pixels wide and
a center fixed at a pixel column of 1795. We also sub-
tracted the background at every pixel row, which was
calculated as the median of two 50-pixel-wide regions

spectrum of GJ 341. We did this in an attempt to con-
strain the covering fractions of star spots and faculae
and hence determine the impact of stellar contamination
on our transmission spectra. To do this, we processed
our stellar spectra through stage 2 of the jwst pipeline.
Specifically, taking the gainscalestep.fits files, we
processed these through the assign wcs,flat field ,
extract 2d,srctype ,pathloss andphotom steps. We
did not perform the background step, and instead used
an alternate version of our stage 1 reduction where we
did perform a group-level background subtraction.
We then used Tiberius to perform standard aper-
ture photometry on our photomstep.fits files using an
aperture with a full width of 20 pixels. Despite running
thesrctype command with the --source type POINT
argument defined, the resulting units of our spectra were
MJy/sr. We therefore had to multiply our spectra by
the solid angle of a pixel, listed as PIXAR SRin the
photomstep.fits header, to convert to MJy. We de-
fined the flux uncertainties in the flux calibrated spec-
tra as being the standard deviation of each pixel’s flux
across the time series. We found no significant vari-
ability in the flux-calibrated spectra from visit-to-visit
(≤0.1 %) and within each visit (0 .24 %).
We then computed multi-component forward models
using the Allard et al. (2012) PHOENIX stellar models
to quantify star spot and faculae covering fractions of
the stellar surface for each of the three visits. We em-
ployed a weighted linear combination of three PHOENIX
models to represent the background photosphere, spots
(Teff≤Teff,photosphere - 100 K), and faculae ( Teff≥
Teff,photosphere + 100 K). We assumed that all spots have
the same Teff, log( g), and metallicity, as do the facu-lae, and each feature is required to not exceed 45% of
the total surface. The grid of PHOENIX models used for
our analysis covered Teff= 2800 – 4000 K, log( g) = 4
– 5.5 cm s−2, [Fe/H] = -0.5 – 0.5 providing extensive
coverage of possible spot and faculae temperatures for
GJ 341 assuming photospheric values near the litera-
ture quoted Teff= 3770 ±40 K and log( g) = 4.72 ±
0.02 cm s−2(DiTomasso et al. 2023). The models were
scaled by R2
∗/dist2using literature values for GJ 341:
R∗=0.506 R ⊙(DiTomasso et al. 2023) and d= 10.45
pc (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021). We also smoothed
and interpolated the models to be the same resolution
as the observations before calculating a reduced- χ2. In
our reduced- χ2calculations, we considered 868 wave-
length points for each visit and eight fitted parameters
(theTeff, log( g), and [Fe/H] of the photosphere, the Teff
and coverage fraction of both spots and faculae, and a
scaling factor). The scaling factor was multiplied by the
R2
∗/d2term to account for uncertainty in either mea-
sured quantity and varied from 0.9 to 1.3.
Unlike in our application of this procedure to the stel-
lar spectra of GJ 486 (Lustig-Yaeger & Fu et al. 2023b)
and GJ 1132 (May & MacDonald et al. 2023), which
used NIRSpec/G395H, we could not obtain an accept-
able fit to the flux-calibrated NIRCam/F444W spectra
(χ2
ν∼60), as shown in Figure 5. We do not know
the reason for these poor fits, however, the shape of
our extracted spectrum changes significantly when we
apply the photometric calibration ( photom ) step in the
jwst pipeline, suggesting that the NIRCam PHOTOM
reference file may be responsible. Given the poor fits
in Figure 5, and lack of contamination evident in our
transmission spectra (see section 4), we do interpret theJWST/NIRCam transmission spectroscopy of GJ 341b 9
results from our analysis of the flux calibrated spectrum
as evidence for stellar contamination in our data.
4.GJ 341b’s TRANSMISSION SPECTRUM
The transmission spectra we measure for GJ 341b
from the three different reductions are shown in Fig-
ure 6. This figure demonstrates that the three indepen-
dent reductions produce consistent transmission spec-
tra. For this figure, we offset the Eureka! spectrum by
-15 ppm so that its median transit depth matches that
ofTiberius and Tswift between 4.0 and 4.8 µm. We
include the transmission spectra measured for each visit
by each reduction in the Appendix (Figure 13) which
demonstrates that the spectra are also consistent be-
tween visits for each reduction. In the following subsec-
tions, we further investigate the transmission spectrum
of GJ 341b with flat line rejection tests, atmosphere for-
ward models, and retrievals.
4.1. Gaussian flat line rejection tests
We begin our assessment of the GJ 341b transmission
spectrum by quantifying the statistical significance of
any potential features in the spectrum relative to the
null hypothesis. In this case, the null hypothesis is
that the planet possesses a flat, featureless transmission
spectrum that is devoid of atmospheric information, as
would be the case if the planet does not possess an at-
mosphere or the atmospheric signal falls below our de-
tection sensitivity (Kreidberg et al. 2014; Lustig-Yaeger
& Fu et al. 2023b).
Following the approaches of Moran & Stevenson et
al. (2023) and May & MacDonald et al. (2023), we
perform two statistical tests on the transmission spec-
tra from each data reduction pipeline. The first test
quantifies the (in)consistency of our measurements with
the null hypothesis given the observational errors, while
the second test quantifies the evidence favoring an ag-
nostic Gaussian absorption feature in the spectrum over
the flat null hypothesis. As both tests use slightly dif-
ferent approaches to quantify the significance of one or
more features in the spectrum, they are both useful di-
agnostics. However, these tests are limited to statistical
statements about the spectrum as opposed to physical
explanations, which require the more detailed modeling
presented in the forthcoming subsections.
To understand whether the observed spectrum is con-
sistent with the null hypothesis, we generated 100,000
random spectra on the same wavelength grid subject to
the assumption that the underlying true planet spec-
trum is the null hypothesis and the observational errors
are unchanged from those observed. We calculated the
reduced chi-squared ( χ2
ν) for each sample and build upthe expected distribution of χ2
νunder the null hypoth-
esis. That is, if the null hypothesis were true then we
would expect that our measured χ2
νwould be a single
sample from that distribution. Thus, we can quantify
the probability that the measured χ2
νvalue would be at
least as large as the one we observed given the assump-
tion of the null hypothesis (i.e., a p-value).
To understand whether there is evidence of a spectral
feature in the observed spectrum, we first fit a flat fea-
tureless spectrum to the data and then fit an agnostic
Gaussian model to the spectrum. We then compare the
Bayesian evidence of the two fits and calculate Bayes fac-
tors to estimate which model is preferred, as in Moran
& Stevenson et al. (2023) and May & MacDonald et
al. (2023). The Gaussian model contains four fitting
parameters, which are all constrained by uniform priors.
These include the wavelength independent transit depth
upon which the Gaussian feature is added ∼U(0.0,1.0),
the wavelength of the Gaussian center ∼U(3.5,5.5)µm,
the width of the feature ∼U(∆x0,∆x1)µm, where ∆ x0
is the minimum spectroscopic bin width and ∆ x1is the
width of the entire wavelength range of the data, and
the amplitude of the Gaussian feature ∼U(−10σy,10σy),
where σyis the standard deviation of the transmis-
sion spectrum measurements (i.e., features should not
greatly exceed the scatter in the data).
The results of these tests are shown in Table 3. This
demonstrates that the Eureka! spectrum is the flat-
test of the three spectra, ruling out our null hypothe-
sis at only 0 .2σ, while the Gaussian feature test favors
a flat line over a feature at 2 .2σ. The Tiberius and
Tswift spectra are less flat. However, in the case of
theTiberius spectrum we believe this is due to the
smaller uncertainties in its transmission spectrum (see
Section 4.2). For these reductions, the null hypothesis
is in weak tension, at 1 .3σforTiberius and 1 .4σfor
Tswift . The Gaussian feature test results in 2 .3σevi-
dence for a feature in the Tiberius spectrum (broad and
centered near 4.3 µm) and 2 .9σin the Tswift spectrum
(width of ∼0.2µm centered near 4.7 µm). While these
look promising at face value, as we see from these tests
and demonstrate with our subsequent retrieval analysis
(section 4.4), the two candidate features occur at dif-
ferent wavelengths between the Tiberius and Tswift
spectra and are therefore less likely to be astrophysical.
4.2. Sensitivity to Spectrum Uncertainties
The results of the aforementioned flat line rejection
tests depend not just on potential features in the spec-
trum, but also on the size of the error bars, which are
not equivalent for each reduction. The 1 σspectroscopic10 Kirk et al.

transmission spectra, we do interpret these model results as evidence for stellar contamination in our data.

Figure 6. GJ 341b’s transmission spectrum as measured by Tiberius (blue), Eureka! (orange) and Tswift (green). These
spectra are the the weighted means of the three visits’ spectra. The Eureka! spectrum has been offset by -15 ppm to make the
median transit depths equal to Tiberius and Tswift between 4.0 and 4.8 µm.
transit depth uncertainties are shown in Figure 7 (lower
panel). Since all reductions used approximately the
same spectral bin widths, we can readily compare their
1σuncertainties and apply the errors from one reduc-
tion to the others to estimate the role of uncertainties
in driving the statistical results of our null hypothesis
tests. Table 4 shows χ2
νvalues for flat line fits to each re-
duction’s transmission spectrum data points (rows) with
errors interpolated from the other reductions (columns).
Figure 7 (lower panel) and Table 4 show that the dif-
ferences in uncertainties between reductions leads to sta-tistically significant differences in χ2
ν. The Tiberius re-
duction has the smallest uncertainties and when those
are applied to the Eureka! and Tswift spectra, those
spectra deviate more from a flat line. On the other hand,
theTswift spectrum has χ2
ν>1 regardless of which er-
rors are applied, consistent with the larger deviations
seen in the Tswift spectrum. The Eureka! spectrum
has relatively large errors, but relatively small spectro-
scopic deviations, which together explain our statistical
result and subsequent physical interpretations.

current. The Tiberius ,Tswift , and Eureka! re-
ductions achieve a median precision of 1.03 ×, 1.05×,
and 1.14 ×the noise limit, respectively. This order-
ing is different to the white light curve residuals, where
Eureka! obtained the lowest residual RMS (Figure 2).
The lower RMS of Tiberius andTswift at the spectro-
scopic light curve stage comes from those pipelines’ use
of a common mode correction. Although the Tiberius
transit depth uncertainties are lower than the predicted
PandExo uncertainties, this is likely due to improved per-
formance relative to the model-based prediction, since
theTiberius reduction still sits above the noise limit
(Figure 7, upper panel).
4.3. Atmosphere forward models
As with previous targets in program JWST-GO-1981,
we compare our transmission spectra of GJ 341b to a set
of atmospheric forward models to infer whether the data
suggests that the planet possesses an appreciable atmo-
sphere, and if so, its composition (Lustig-Yaeger & Fu et
Figure 7. Light curve residual RMS (upper panel) and
transit depth uncertainties (lower panel) for each reduction
(color lines). The expected noise (photon + readnoise + dark
current) calculated from the data is shown in the upper panel
(black line) and the median RMS relative to the expected
noise is listed in the legend for each reduction. The predicted
noise from PandExo (Batalha et al. 2017) is shown in the
lower panel (black line).
al. 2023b; Moran & Stevenson et al. 2023; May & Mac-
Donald et al. 2023). Since GJ 341b has no published
mass constraints beyond an upper limit ( ≤3 M⊕at
1σ; DiTomasso et al. 2023), we generate forward models
using a planetary mass of 0.73 M ⊕. This mass assumes
that the planetary radius of 0.92 R ⊕is consistent with a
rocky bulk composition, as Luque & Pall´ e (2022) showed
that very small ( ≤1 R⊕) planets around M-dwarfs, like
GJ 341b, appear to have very tightly constrained densi-
ties similar to Earth-like iron-silicate bulk compositions.
Our atmospheric forward models include two cases:
1)CHIMERA thermochemical equilibrium models (Line
et al. 2013, 2014) from 100-1000 ×solar metallicity, us-
ing a parameterized temperature-pressure profile (Guil-
lot 2010) with an equilibrium temperature of 540 K and12 Kirk et al.
opacity contributions from H 2O, CH 4, CO, CO 2, NH 3,
HCN, H 2S, H 2, and He; and 2) PICASO (Batalha et al.
2019) models of single-gas atmospheres with an isother-
mal temperature-pressure profile at 540 K. The PICASO
models include atmospheres of pure 1 bar H 2O, CO 2, or
CH4, as well as a flat line model representative of no at-
mosphere or a uniform aerosol layer. For all model con-
figurations, we compute synthetic transmission spectra
with PICASO ’s radiative transfer routine using molecu-
lar opacities resampled from R = 60,000 (Batalha et al.
2020), rebinned to the resolution of each data reduction.
We compute best fits by calculating the χ2
νbetween each
reduction and each forward model, with 57, 54, or 55
degrees of freedom (dof) for the Tiberius ,Tswift , and
Eureka! reductions, respectively. We include an offset
in relative transit depth to the mean of each reduction
in our fitting. Our results for Eureka! are shown in Fig-
ure 8, while those for Tiberius andTswift are shown in
Figures 14 and 15. We include the complete set of sta-
tistical constraints for each reduction compared to each
forward model case in Table 5.
Across all three reductions, hydrogen-dominated or
methane atmospheric models do not fit the data. For the
Tswift reduction, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres as
metal-rich as 1000 ×solar can be ruled out to 3 σ, while
this constraint is reduced to 350 ×solar for Tiberius
and Eureka! . Such hydrogen-rich atmospheres would
be unexpected to persist against escape, so this result
is unsurprising. Methane atmospheres of 1 bar are dis-
favored at 3 σ, 2.5σ, or 1 σbetween Tswift ,Tiberius ,
andEureka! .
On the other hand, water atmospheres or a flat line
– which could stem either from an airless world or from
a hazy world – are consistent with each reduction, with
χ2
ν≲1. Though water is a ubiquitous molecule and
common in warm planetary atmospheres, we are unable
to rule it out here since water has no strong absorp-
tion bandheads and instead acts as a continuum-like
absorber from 4-5 µm. Both Eureka! and Tiberius
also are consistent ( χ2
ν≲1) with a carbon dioxide at-
mosphere, while Tswift disfavors this scenario to 2 σ.
Despite the excellent agreement between each data
reduction (Figure 6), there are obvious differences in
goodness of fit between atmospheric models. This oc-
curs due to 1) the planet’s small size and temperature,
which results in a very small atmospheric scale height,
and 2) the ratio of the sub-Earth radius (R P=0.92 R ⊕)
to the relatively large radius of the star for an M-
dwarf (R ∗=0.506 R ⊙), resulting in a very shallow tran-
sit. Given these physical parameters, our 350 ×solar,
hydrogen-dominated atmosphere model has a peak fea-
ture size of 40 ppm while a carbon dioxide atmospheremodel has a peak feature size of only 15 ppm in the
NIRCam/F444W bandpass. Even with the extremely
high precision obtained by our program (average uncer-
tainties of 15 ppm per 0.02 µm bin), such small feature
sizes mean that minute differences between reductions
driven by random noise or data treatments drive diver-
gent atmospheric interpretations. Overall, either no at-
mosphere, a hazy atmosphere, or an atmosphere con-
taining a species that does not have prominent molecu-
lar bands across the NIRCam/F444W bandpass – e.g., a
water-dominated atmosphere – provide the best expla-
nation of the data across the three reductions compared
to our forward models.
4.4. Atmosphere retrievals
To examine a broader range of atmospheric parameter
space that is (in)consistent with our measurements, we
ran a set of retrievals using the Spectral Mapping At-
mospheric Radiative Transfer Exoplanet Retrieval code
(smarter ; Lustig-Yaeger et al. 2022, 2023a; Lustig-
Yaeger & Fu et al. 2023b). We use the same smarter
modeling approach and assumptions as described in
Lustig-Yaeger & Fu et al. (2023b), except slightly mod-
ified to account for the different planet parameters. We
run separate retrievals on each of the final coadded spec-
tra from the Eureka! ,Tiberius , and Tswift reduc-
tions.
Our nominal retrieval setup for GJ 341b uses 11 free
parameters. We include the following six spectroscopi-
cally active gases that have (or partially have) absorp-
tion bands in the NIRCam F444W wavelength range and
are plausible candidate gases for secondary atmospheres
at temperatures at or near GJ 341b’s equilibrium tem-
perature of 540 K: H 2O, CH 4, CO, CO 2, N2O, and O 3.
Each gas is fitted in terms of the log 10evenly-mixed
volume mixing ratio (VMR) with a flat prior, VMR
∼ U(−12,0). The bulk atmospheric constituent is left
agnostic by fitting for the mean molecular weight of the
primary constituent using a flat prior, µ∼ U(2.5,50)
g/mol, which ranges from a low-mass mix of H 2+He to
heavier than CO 2(44 g/mol) and O 3(48 g/mol). Al-
though aerosols are not explicitly included in our re-
trievals, we fit for the opaque planet radius using a
uniform prior Rp∼ U(0.83,1.01)R⊕, which could be
due to a cloud deck, the solid planetary surface (Ben-
neke & Seager 2012), additional continuum opacity, or
the critical refraction limit (B´ etr´ emieux & Kaltenegger
2013; Misra et al. 2014). We fit for the pressure at the
opaque surface using a uniform prior, P0∼ U(−1,6)
Pa. An isothermal temperature structure is assumedJWST/NIRCam transmission spectroscopy of GJ 341b 13
Figure 8. Atmospheric forward models compared to the Eureka! reduction from JWST /NIRCam. Because of the planet’s small
size and low equilibrium temperature, only hydrogen-dominated or methane atmospheres are strongly ruled out or disfavored
by the data. Atmospheres of water, carbon dioxide, or an opaque haze layer – or no atmosphere – are all statistically consistent
with the data to within ∼1σacross all three reductions.

we allow the planet mass to vary uniformly between
Mp∼ U(0.3,2.2)M⊕.
Our smarter retrievals use the dynesty (Speagle
2020) nested sampling algorithm (Skilling 2004) with
600 live points. We run the model until the contribution
to the total evidence from the remaining prior volume
drops below dlogz=0.075 .
Figure 9 shows a summary of our retrieval results,
comparing top-level findings for each data reduction
pipeline. Figures 16, 17, and 18 (in Appendix E)
show results for the Eureka! ,Tiberius , and Tswift
pipelines, respectively. Based on the χ2
νvalues from
the median retrieved spectrum, the retrievals are over-fitting the spectrum, and therefore likely fitting noise.
Nonetheless, they reveal important aspects of our ob-
servational sensitivity to the possible atmosphere of
GJ 341b as well as the agreement/disagreement between
the reduction pipelines. As previously discussed, the
Eureka! reduction appears the most flat and as a result
the retrieval rules out a limited slice of parameter space
that corresponds to only the thickest (reference pres-
sures P0>104Pa) and most extended atmospheres,
with high abundances of absorbing gases, that we ex-
plored.
On the other hand, the Tiberius andTswift reduc-

do not agree on the wavelength/molecule responsible for
the feature, implying that these are not real astrophys-
ical signals. The retrieval results for Tiberius favor
high abundances of CO 2(−2.1+1.2
−1.9dex) with moderate
abundances of N 2O (−4.3+2.1
−3.9dex) and low abundances
of O 3(−8.3+2.5
−2.7dex; 2 σupper limit of −3.6 dex). The
retrieval results for Tswift show the opposite, favor-
ing low abundances of CO 2(−8.7+2.6
−2.1dex; 2 σupper
limit of −3.6 dex) and N 2O (−8.2+2.8
−2.4dex; 2 σupper
limit of −2.7 dex) and high abundances of O 3(−1.8+1.0
−1.8
dex). These O 3and CO 2constraints differ at ∼1.5σ.
Our Bayesian model comparisons (using the Bayesian
evidence ratios computed by dynesty ) find that the
Tiberius reduction implies a weak detection of CO 2
(3.1σ), but no O 3, while the Tswift reduction instead
leads to a weak detection of O 3(2.9σ), but no CO 2.
Conversely, the Eureka! reduction favors no detected
gases at >1σsignificance. However, both Tiberius and
Tswift retrievals levy similar constraints on the refer-
ence pressure, isothermal temperature, reference radius,
planet mass, and mean molecular weight which are allin agreement at better than 1 σ. These findings sug-
gest that different noise instances with otherwise similar
noise properties dominate the character of each reduced
spectrum, as opposed to planetary characteristics. Fur-
thermore, the statistical significance of results from any
one pipeline must be interpreted as lower than the as-
sessment of that spectrum in isolation would suggest.
5.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We have measured the 3.9–5.0 µm transmission spec-
trum of the sub-Earth sized exoplanet GJ 341b using
JWST’s NIRCam instrument. Our transmission spec-
trum is the result of co-adding the transmission spec-
tra measured from three separate transit observations
and represents the first observation of this planet’s at-
mosphere. We reduced the data using three indepen-
dent pipelines ( Eureka! ,Tiberius and Tswift ) and
performed several tests to determine the significance of
an atmosphere detection.
5.1. The NIRCam/F444W data qualityJWST/NIRCam transmission spectroscopy of GJ 341b 15
Our NIRCam/F444W data is dominated by an expo-
nential ramp that varies between the three visits (Fig-
ure 1). Despite fitting for this ramp, there is resid-
ual red noise in the white light curve data (Figure 2).
This red noise becomes apparent at timescales between
∼1−30 minutes. We attempted to remove this red
noise by using up to ten engineering telemetry time-
series (‘mnemonics’) in our systematics model (Figure
3). Despite encouraging signs, we were unable to signif-
icantly improve the residual red noise. We believe that
the JWST engineering mnemonics do present an oppor-
tunity to detrend JWST spectrophotometry in general,
however, we leave further attempts to do so to future
work. Fortunately, this red noise is not significant in the
spectroscopic light curves with our light curves reaching
between 1.03 and 1.14 ×the noise limit (Fig. 7). As a
result, we were able to obtain a very precise transmission
spectrum from our three coadded visits, with an aver-
age uncertainty of 15 ppm in 0.02 µm bins. For these
reasons, we recommend the use of NIRCam/F444W for
studies of bright exoplanet systems. While NIRCam also
provides us with short wavelength photometry (as used
successfully in the ERS program, Ahrer et al. 2023), our
extraction of this here shows that is not always benefi-
cial.
5.2. GJ 341b’s transmission spectrum
The main conclusion we draw from our high precision
transmission spectrum of GJ 341b is that the planet has
not retained a low mean molecular weight atmosphere.
This is consistent with expectations from the cosmic
shoreline (Zahnle & Catling 2017) that small planets
like GJ 341b should be stripped of any primordial H/He-
dominated atmosphere. Digging deeper, we find that
the very high precision of our data, combined with the
small expected feature amplitudes, leads our statistical
tests, forward models and retrievals to slightly different
conclusions.
In our null hypothesis tests, the Eureka! spectrum
was consistent with being flat to within 0 .2σwhile the
Tiberius and Tswift spectra were less consistent at
1.3σand 1 .4σ, respectively. However, we believe that
the relative consistency with being flat is driven by
the relative size of the uncertainties for each transmis-
sion spectrum. Repeating the null hypothesis tests but
switching the uncertainties between the reductions, we
find that Tiberius is inherently the flattest spectrum,
followed by Eureka! and then Tswift .
Our Gaussian feature tests, using the default uncer-
tainties for each reduction, find 2 .2σevidence against
a feature for Eureka! and 2 .3σand 2 .9σevidence for
features in the Tiberius and Tswift spectra, respec-tively. However, our atmospheric retrievals find that
different species are responsible for these candidate fea-
tures: CO 2in the Tiberius spectrum at 3 .1σand O 3
in the Tswift spectrum at 2 .9σ, with a relative differ-
ence between the CO 2and O 3abundance constraints of
∼1.5σ. These differences suggest that these ‘features’
are not real astrophysical signals.
Our forward model analysis finds that each reduction’s
spectrum rejects a <285×solar metallicity atmosphere
to≥3σ, with the Tswift spectrum rejecting a <1000×
solar metallicity atmosphere. Instead, the forward mod-
els find our transmission spectra are consistent with no
atmosphere, a hazy atmosphere, or an atmosphere con-
taining a species that does not have prominent molecular
bands across the NIRCam/F444W bandpass, e.g. H 2O.
Furthermore, CH 4-dominated atmospheres are ruled out
to 1σ–3σdepending on the reduction, while CO 2atmo-
spheres are consistent with the Eureka! andTiberius
spectra to <1σand inconsistent with the Tswift spec-
trum to >2σ.
At the radius and equilibrium temperature of GJ 341b,
atmospheres dominated by CO 2, H2O or O 2/O3, result-
ing from post-runaway atmospheres, are all plausible
and even predicted (Luger & Barnes 2015; Gao et al.
2015; Schaefer et al. 2016; Lincowski et al. 2018; Kite
& Schaefer 2021; Krissansen-Totton & Fortney 2022).
Therefore, the single gas end member atmospheres that
result from our forward modelling, and that are con-
sistent with our retrievals, are in line with expecta-
tions. However, since a rocky exoplanet atmosphere has
yet to be detected and characterized, the possibilities
are largely restricted to theoretical predictions and the
range of possible temperatures, pressures and gas abun-
dance combinations that are consistent with the obser-
vations is vast. Furthermore the fact that each pipeline
prefers a different gas demonstrates that the evidence
for these gases is not due to real astrophysical signals.
Our study of this shallow transit (240 ppm) demon-
strates that small differences between pipelines’ spectra
can lead to differences in the conclusions drawn from sta-
tistical tests, atmospheric forward models and retrievals.
Therefore, it is imperative that such studies use multiple
independent pipelines, two or more visits, and several
statistical tests to determine the robustness of future
claims of atmospheric absorption for small exoplanets.
5.3. The Cosmic Shoreline for M-dwarfs
GJ 341b is the fourth planet to be studied as part of
our reconnaissance program (PID:1981) to test the exis-
tence of an M-dwarf Cosmic Shoreline (Zahnle & Catling
2017). Our results so far are consistent with expecta-
tions (Figure 10). GJ 341b (this work) and LHS 475b16 Kirk et al.
Figure 10. The M-dwarf Cosmic Shoreline (Zahnle &
Catling 2017) plotted in escape velocity–instellation space.
Planets that sit below the shoreline (gray line) are more likely
to have atmospheres and those above are less likely. The tar-
gets in our program are: GJ 341b (this paper), LHS 475b
(Lustig-Yaeger & Fu et al. 2023b), GJ 486b (Moran &
Stevenson et al. 2023), GJ 1132b (May & MacDonald et
al. 2023) and TRAPPIST-1h (Rustamkulov & Peacock et
al., in prep.). We include the other TRAPPIST-1 planets
for reference.
(Lustig-Yaeger & Fu et al. 2023b) sit on the dry/airless
side of the shoreline, which is consistent with our trans-
mission spectra. GJ 486b (Moran & Stevenson et al.
2023) and GJ 1132b (May & MacDonald et al. 2023)
sit at the edge of the shoreline, where atmospheres and
atmosphere-less are both possible outcomes. GJ 486b
shows water in its transmission spectrum, although this
could be stellar contamination. GJ 1132b paints an in-
consistent picture between the two visits’ transits, mak-
ing inferences more challenging. Our remaining tar-
get (TRAPPIST-1h) is likely to have an atmosphere
based on expectations from the shoreline. Our upcom-
ing transit observations will shed light on the existence
of its atmosphere. Taken together, our program has
demonstrated the tight constraints that can be placed
on Earth-sized exoplanet atmospheres.
Looking beyond our program to other JWST
studies of Earth-sized exoplanets around M-dwarfs,
TRAPPIST-1b and c are both consistent with having
no atmosphere (Greene et al. 2023; Lim et al. 2023;
Zieba et al. 2023). TRAPPIST-1b is close to the Cos-mic Shoreline and thus the lack of an atmosphere is
not in tension with expectations. TRAPPIST-1c, on
the other hand, sits on the atmosphere side. However,
the shoreline presented in Figure 10 is plotted in terms
of the relative instellation. The XUV cosmic shoreline
would sit below this (Zahnle & Catling 2017) and may
be consistent with the TRAPPIST-1c result. If the re-
sults of no atmospheres for these planets hold, then this
could be emerging evidence that XUV dominates the
cosmic shoreline in these late M-dwarf systems, consis-
tent with past escape predictions (Wheatley et al. 2017;
Dong et al. 2018). Only by combining results from wider
and deeper surveys, including ongoing JWST programs
(e.g., PID: 2512), will we be able to confidently deter-
mine the boundaries of a cosmic shoreline for M-dwarfs,
if indeed one exists.

Figure 16. Atmospheric retrieval posteriors (lower left corner pairs) and range of spectral fits (upper right) from our coadded
NIRCam observations of GJ 341b reduced with Eureka! . A subset of model parameters and covariances are shown, with H 2O,
CH4, and CO not displayed (nor constrained) for clarity. Analogous results are shown for the Tiberius and Tswift data
reduction pipelines in Figures 17 and 18, respectively.
