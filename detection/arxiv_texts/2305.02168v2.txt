Abstract. We propose a sharp-interface model for a hyperelastic material c onsisting
of two phases. In this model, phase interfaces are treated in the d eformed conﬁguration,
resulting in a fully Eulerian interfacial energy. In order to penalize lar ge curvature of
the interface, we include a geometric term featuring a curvature v arifold. Equilibrium
solutions are proved to exist via minimization. We then utilize this model in an Eulerian
topology optimization problem that incorporates a curvature pena lization.
1.Introduction
In the ﬁeld of elasticity, it is commonly assumed that experimentally ob served pat-
terns in materials correspond to the minimization of a suitable phase- dependent energy.
Indeed, some materials have multiple phases, and the optimal energ etic conﬁguration
is often achieved by creating spatial microstructures composed o f these phases. These
microstructures feature their own unique size, shape, and distrib ution (such as grains,
precipitates, dendrites, spherulites, lamellae, or pores). The pha ses can be distinguished
from each other by their various crystalline, semicrystalline, or amo rphous properties,
which can be experimentally identiﬁed through microscopy technique s.
To fully understand the behavior of a material, it is necessary to cha racterize the
relation between the macroscopic properties and the underlying ph enomena occurring at
the microstructural scale. To shed light on the multiscale nature of this phenomenon
is paramount for optimizing material performance and developing ne w materials with
tailored properties.
A prominent example of materials with microstructure are shape mem ory alloys, show-
ing a highly symmetric crystallographic variant called austenite, pref erred at high tem-
peratures, as well as diﬀerent low-symmetry variants called marte nsites, favored at low
temperatures. These alloys, including NiTi, CuAlNi, or InTh, are widely used in various
technological applications, as discussed in [25]. The mixing of these diﬀ erent phases lead
to the formation of complex microstructures, which ultimately gove rn the rich thermo-
mechanical response of the material.
In the continuum theory, the total stored energy of the system usually consists of bulk
and interfacial energy contributions. Neglecting the interfacial e nergy generically leads to
a minimization problem that has no solution due to the formation of spa tially ﬁner and
ﬁner oscillations of the deformation gradient among the various pha ses. If spatial phase
changes are penalized by the interfacial energy, an optimal mater ial layout is reached by

balancing energy contributions rising from the bulk and the interfac e, under the eﬀect of
external loading.
Diﬀerent models have been considered taking into account interfac ial energy in var-
ious forms. This includes strain gradients [7,36] but also gradients o f nonlinear null
Lagrangians of the deformation [9]. Curved interfaces in solids are t horoughly studied
in [22] following previous research on interface-bulk elastic interact ions [21]. Curved twin
boundaries in lead orthovanadate are observed in [27], see also [11] f or discussions on
grain boundary shapes or [16] for curvature-dependent interfa cial energies in nanomate-
rials. Recently ˇSilhav´ y introduced in [33] a notion of interface polyconvexity and pr oved
it suﬃcient to ensure the existence of minimizers for the correspon ding static problem.
In particular, it his model the perimeters of interfaces in the refer ence and deformed con-
ﬁgurations, as well as the deformations of lines in the referential in terfaces are penalized.
A more explicit characterization of interface polyconvexity can be f ound in [19,20], dis-
cussing thecaseofmaterialswithmorethantwophasesaswell. Again , letusmentionthat
the mathematical treatment of multiphase materials without surfa ce-energy penalization
typically leads to ill-posed problems where the existence of a solution is not necessarily
guaranteed, and some relaxation is needed, cf. [13]. This, howeve r, would challenge orien-
tation preservation of the involved deformations, and consequen tly, also injectivity may
be lost [6].
In this article, we consider a material with two phases, separated b y a sharp interface.
Note however that our model can be extended to describe more ph ases similarly as in [32],
see Remark 8. To incorporate the penalization of large interface cu rvatures, we describe
theinterfaceintermsofacurvaturevarifold,ameasure-theore ticgeneralizationofclassical
surfaces with a notion of curvature and with good compactness pr operties [24,28,34].
Mathematical models involving varifolds have been used to describe b ending-resistant
interfaces in a wide rangeof applications, forinstance inthe modeling ofcracks [17,18,26],
biological membranes [10,14,31], or anisotropic phase transitions [3 0].
The state of the elastic body is characterized by the deformation yof the reference
conﬁguration Ω ⊂R3, the phase ﬁeld φ, and a curvature varifold Vdescribing the phase
interface. The equilibrium state minimizes the energy E, consisting of the elastic bulk
energy and the energy of the phase interface. If the varifold Vand the phase interface
correspond to a smoothly embedded surface M⊂R3with second fundamental form II,
our energy typically looks as follows

see Section 3.2 for the general deﬁnition and all necessary details.
The main result of this work is the proof of the existence of minimizers with the
phase ﬁeld and the varifold deﬁned in the deformed conﬁguration, i.e ., in the Eulerian
setting. In order to ﬁnd a good framework for the direct method in the Calculus of
Variations, two important challenges need to be met: Firstly, a suita ble coupling needs
to be imposed to identify the varifold with the phase ﬁeld, see Deﬁnitio n 3. Secondly,
the Eulerian setting implies that both φandVare deﬁned in the deformed conﬁguration
y(Ω), which itself is subject to minimization. Once compactness is achie ved, the existence
of minimizers follows fromtheclosedness ofthecoupling conditiontog ether withthelowerCURVATURE-DEPENDENT EULERIAN INTERFACES 3
semicontinuity of the energy via the usual (poly-)convexity assum ptions. Note that, if no
curvature term was present in the energy no varifold Vwould be needed and the existence
of minimizers would follow from the theory in [19].
Moreover, we adapt the variational theory to study a related pro blem in topology
optimization, taking into account the curvature of the design mate rial surface. We also
provide a corresponding referential formulation which might be com putationally more
feasible.
Thisarticleisorganizedasfollows. InSection2,weintroducebasicno tionsandnotation
on functions of bounded variation and varifolds. Our model is prese nted in Section 3 and
the existence of a solution is proved in Section 4. This allows us to sett le a problem of
topology optimization in the Eulerian coordinates and to establish the existence of an
optimal topological design in Section 5.
2.Notation and preliminaries
2.1.Piecewise constant functions of bounded variation. LetU⊂R3be open. By
BV(U) we denote the class of functions of bounded variation and bySBV(U) the class
ofspecial functions of bounded variation , see [3]. We set
SBV(U;{0,1}) :={φ∈SBV(U) :φ(x)∈ {0,1}for a.e.x∈U}.
Itselements are piecewise constant functions inthesenseof[3,Def.4.21],restrictedtoonly
assuming values in {0,1}. The weak derivative of φ∈SBV(U;{0,1}) is theR3-valued
Radon measure
Dφ=νφ(H2/rightangleswJφ)∈ M(U;R3).
Here,H2is the two-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure, Jφ⊂Uis the approximate jump set,
which is countably H2-rectiﬁable, and νφ:Jφ→S2is the unit normal vector. The total
variation norm of Dφis given by
|Dφ|(U) =H2(Jφ). (1)
By deﬁnition, functions φ∈SBV(U;{0,1}) are characteristic functions of some E⊂U
of ﬁnite perimeter, i.e., φ= 1E:U→Rwith
1E(x) :=/braceleftBigg
1, x∈E
0,otherwise.
In particular, Jφcoincides with the reduced boundary of Eup to aH2-null set, νφpoints
in the interior of E, and|Dφ|(U) is the perimeter of E.
For the convenience of the reader, we recall the compactness th eorem for piecewise
constant functions which follows from [3, Thm. 3.23, Thm. 4.25].
Theorem 1 (Compactness of piecewise constant SBV-functions) .LetU⊂R3be an
open, bounded Lipschitz domain. Let (φn)n∈N⊂SBV(U)be piecewise constant functions,

Then there exists a piecewise constant function φ∈SBV(U)such that after passing to a

2.2.Oriented curvature varifolds. We brieﬂy introduce the relevant deﬁnitions for
varifolds, restricting to two-varifolds in the open set U⊂R3. LetG2,3denote the Grass-
mannian, i.e., the set of all two-dimensional linear subspaces of R3, which we describe by
their orthogonal projection matrices P∈R3×3. We identify the oriented Grassmannian
with the two-sphere S2by representing an oriented two-dimensional subspace by its unit
normal.
Following [24], an oriented two-varifold inUis a (nonnegative) Radon measure

Pushforward of Vby the covering map q:U×S2→U×G2,3,q(x,ν) = (x,I3×3−ν⊗ν)

Acurvature two-varifold (in the sense of [24], i.e., without boundary measure [28]), de-
noted by V∈CV2(U), is an integral varifold V∈IV2(U) such that there exist generalized

We conclude with a compactness theorem for oriented curvature v arifolds without bound-
ary, still restricting to two-varifolds in U⊂R3. The result is a combination of the
compactness theorem [24, Thm. 3.1] for oriented integral varifold s and [28, Thm. 6.1] for
curvature varifolds.

3.Model
3.1.States. Let Ω⊂R3be an open, bounded Lipschitz domain, which describes the
reference conﬁguration of an elastic body. The state of the body is characterized by the
deformation y, thephase ﬁeld (orphase indicator )φ, and the oriented curvature varifold
Vcorresponding to the phase interfaces. The deformation is a homeomorphism
y: Ω→y(Ω)⊂R3,
mapping points in X∈Ω to points x=y(X)∈y(Ω). We describe the interfaces in the
Eulerian setting, that is, both φandVare deﬁned on the current conﬁguration y(Ω) of
the body, namely
φ∈SBV(y(Ω);{0,1}) and V∈CVo
2(y(Ω)).
Sinceyis a homeomorphism, y(Ω)⊂R3is an open set.
A crucial ingredient of the model is that we introduce a coupling relat ing the phase φ
and the varifold Vin the following sense.
Deﬁnition 3 (Coupling) .LetU⊂R3be open and consider the linear map
Q:C0
c(U;R3)→C0
c(U×S2),(QY)(x,ν) :=Y(x)·ν.
An oriented varifold V∈ M(U×S2) and a phase ﬁeld φ∈SBV(U;{0,1}) are called
coupled in UifDφ=Q′V, i.e., if for all Y∈C0
c(U;R3) we have
/a\}b∇acketle{tDφ,Y/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht=ˆ
JφY·νφdH2=ˆ
U×S2Y(x)·νdV(x,ν) =/a\}b∇acketle{tV,QY/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/a\}b∇acketle{tQ′V,Y/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht.(3)
Here,Q′denotes the Banach space adjoint and we use the dualities C0
c(U;R3)′=
M(U;R3) andC0
c(U×S2)′=M(U×S2), respectively.
Deﬁnition 4 (Admissible set) .We say that a triple ( y,φ,V) isadmissible , in short,
(y,φ,V)∈ A,
if the following conditions are satisﬁed.
(i)y∈W1,r(Ω;R3) is a homeomorphism, r >3;
(ii)φ∈SBV(y(Ω);{0,1});
(iii)V∈CVo
2(y(Ω)) and has no boundary, i.e., ∂TV= 0;
(iv)Vis coupled to φiny(Ω) in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.
Condition (i) is enforced by assuming that y∈W1,r(Ω;R3) satisﬁes det ∇y >0 a.e. in
Ω, that it fulﬁlls the Ciarlet-Neˇ cas condition [12], i.e.,ˆ
Ωdet∇y(x)dx≤ L3(y(Ω)), (4)
and that the distortion |∇y|3/det∇y∈Lr−1(Ω). Namely, nonnegativity of the Jacobian
determinant together with (4) makes yinjective almost everywhere in Ω. Controlling the
distortion in Lr−1(Ω) ensures that yis an open map; cf. [23, Thm. 3.24, p. 43]. This
together with almost everywhere injectivity implies that yis homeomorphic in Ω.
Lemma 5 (Properties of admissible triples) .Let(y,φ,V)∈ A. Then we haveCURVATURE-DEPENDENT EULERIAN INTERFACES 7
(i)Jφ⊂sptµV;
(ii)JφandsptµVarecountably H2-rectiﬁable of class 2, i.e., up to a set of H2-measure
zero, they can be covered by a countable union of embedded, tw o-dimensional C2-
submanifolds of R3.
Proof.If we take a test vector ﬁeld Y∈C0
c(y(Ω);R3) withY≡0 on sptµV, the coupling
(3) impliesˆ

y(Ω)|Y|dµV= 0,
and (i) follows. For (ii), note that Aq♯V∈L1
loc,q♯V(y(Ω)×G2,3) implies that µVhas
locally bounded ﬁrst variation with generalized mean curvature in L1
loc,µV(y(Ω)), and
consequently the statement follows from [29, Theorem 1]. /square
Remark 6. The coupling (iv), i.e., Dφ=Q′Viny(Ω), does not imply that the multiplic-
ity ofVmust be one, in particular, it does not imply V(x,ν) = (H2/rightangleswJφ)(x)⊗δνφ(x)(ν),
cf. (2). Moreover, there may in general be multiple diﬀerent varifo lds coupled with a
ﬁxed phase φ. The reason for this is that Qis not surjective: If u∈C0
c(y(Ω)×S2)
satisﬁesu(x0,±ν) = 1 for some x0∈y(Ω),ν∈S2, there is no representation u=QYfor
Y∈C0
c(y(Ω);R3).

wherer >3 is the same as in Deﬁnition 4. Moreover, we assume that Wiis poly-
convex [5], i.e., that there exists a convex function hi:R19→Rsuch that Wi(F) =
hi(F,CofF,detF) for all F∈R3×3with det F >0 andi= 0,1. It is easily seen that
F/mapsto→(|F|3/detF)r−1is polyconvex in the set of matrices with positive determinants if
r >3. Therefore the right-hand side of (6) can serve as an example of a polyconvex
stored energy density.8 K. BRAZDA, M. KRU ˇZ´IK, F. RUPP, AND U. STEFANELLI
In the interfacial energy, we assume that Ψ: R3×3×3→Ris a convex function satisfying
Ψ(A)≥cint(1+|A|p) for all A∈R3×3×3(7)
for some p >1 andcint>0. Integrating (7), we ﬁnd that the interface energy controls
both the curvature and the mass of the varifold, since

4.Existence of equilibrium states
LetEbe given by (5) and Aas in Deﬁnition 4. Then, the following result holds.
Theorem 7 (Existence) .There exists a minimizer of EonA.
Proof.We observe that ( y,φ,V) = (id,1,0)∈ AandE(id,1,0) =´
ΩW1(I3×3)dX <∞,
which is a consequence of W1(I3×3)<∞and|Ω|<∞. In particular, inf AE <∞.
Let (yn,φn,Vn)n∈N⊂ Abe a minimizing sequence for E. Without loss of generality, we
may assume´
ΩyndX= 0 and
E(yn,φn,Vn)≤Kfor alln∈N.
Inparticular, by (6), wehavedet ∇yn>0a.e.inΩand( yn)n∈N⊂W1,r(Ω;R3)isbounded.
Thus, after passing to a subsequence, we may assume yn⇀ yinW1,r(Ω;R3) and also
yn→yinC0(¯Ω;R3) asn→ ∞. (8)
Moreover, the weak convergence of ( yn)n∈N, the sequential weak continuity of y/mapsto→
det∇y:W1,r(Ω;R3)→Lr/3(Ω), and of y/mapsto→Cof∇y:W1,r(Ω;R3)→Lr/2(Ω;R3×3) yield
∇yn⇀∇yinLr(Ω;R3×3) asn→ ∞, (9)
det∇yn⇀det∇yinLr/3(Ω) asn→ ∞, (10)
Cof∇yn⇀Cof∇yinLr/2(Ω;R3×3) asn→ ∞. (11)
The convergence in (8) allows us to pass to the limit in the right-hand s ide of (4) while the
left-hand side passes to the limit due to the sequential weak continu ity ofy/mapsto→det∇y:
W1,r(Ω;R3)→Lr/3(Ω). Moreover, (9) and (10), together with polyconvexity of F/mapsto→

thatyis also a homeomorphism.
Given a strictly decreasing zero-sequence ( εℓ)ℓ∈N⊂(0,1), let (Uℓ)ℓ∈Ndenote a sequence
of open, bounded Lipschitz domains such that
{x∈y(Ω) : dist( x,∂y(Ω))> εℓ} ⊂Uℓ⊂⊂y(Ω)CURVATURE-DEPENDENT EULERIAN INTERFACES 9
and which, upon extracting a subsequence, is increasing, i.e., Uℓ1⊂Uℓ2whenever ℓ1< ℓ2.
By (8), one easily shows that Uℓforℓ∈Nﬁxed is contained in the image set yn(Ω),
namely,
Uℓ⊂yn(Ω) whenever n≥n(ℓ)∈Nis large enough.
Compactness: First, we examine the sequence of varifolds. For ℓ∈Nandn≥n(ℓ),
consider the restriction
Vℓ
n:=Vn/rightanglesw(Uℓ×S2).
Bytesting thedeﬁnitions ofcurvaturevarifoldsandcurrent boun darieswithtest functions
supported in Uℓ×S2andUℓ, one veriﬁes that
Vℓ
n∈CVo
2(Uℓ), Aq♯Vℓ
n=Aq♯Vn/rightanglesw(Uℓ×S2),and∂TVℓn= 0 inUℓ.
The coercivity assumption (7) implies that
cint/parenleftBig
µVℓn(Uℓ)+ˆ
Uℓ×G2,3|Aq♯Vℓ
n|pd(q♯Vℓ
n)/parenrightBig
≤Eint(yn,Vn)≤K.
After passing to a subsequence, it thus follows from Theorem 2 tha t there exist Vℓ∈
CVo
2(Uℓ) such that Vℓ

inM(Uℓ×G2,3) for 1≤i,j,k≤3. In particular, it follows ∂TVℓ= 0 inUℓ.
Similarly, we ﬁnd that
φℓ
n:=φn|Uℓ∈SBV(Uℓ;{0,1}) with Dφℓ
n=Dφn/rightangleswUℓ.
By (1) and since Jφℓn⊂sptµVℓnby Lemma 5(i), it follows that
H2(Jφℓn) =|Dφℓ
n|(Uℓ)≤µVℓn(yn(Ω))≤K. (12)
Moreover, /ba∇dblφℓ
n/ba∇dblL∞(Uℓ)<∞uniformly as well, because φℓ
n∈SBV(Uℓ;{0,1}) andUℓ⊂
y(¯Ω) is bounded. Consequently, from Theorem 1 it follows that after p assing to a subse-

It is not diﬃcult to see that the above limits are local, i.e., if ℓ < ℓ′, then we have
Vℓ=Vℓ′/rightanglesw(Uℓ×S2), φℓ=φℓ′|Uℓ. (13)
Now, choosing an appropriate diagonal sequence, we thus may ass umeVℓ

We now turn to the bulk term. From the above construction of Uℓit follows that

so that, by sending ﬁrst n→ ∞and then ℓ→ ∞, by (8) we conclude that

By the energy bound and the coercivity assumptions (6), we ﬁnd th at theynhave uni-
formlyLr−1-bounded distortion, r−1>2, and consequently the assumptions of [19,
Lemma 5.3] are satisﬁed. This yields that
φn◦yn→φ◦yinL1(Ω).
The last limit passage, polyconvexity of the bulk energy densities, we ak convergence of
minors (9), (10), (11), and the lower semicontinuity result of Eisen [15] imply that

Consequently, a minimizer of EinAexists. /squareCURVATURE-DEPENDENT EULERIAN INTERFACES 11
Remark 8 (Multiple phases) .Although the model above deals only with two phases, an
extension to a general multiphase material is possible in a similar way as in [4], or [20,33].
More precisely, one can describe the case of m∈Ndistinct phases by redeﬁning

Here, the phase descriptor φ= (φ1,...,φ m) takes values in {0,1}m, i.e.,φ:y(Ω)→
{0,1}m,andthecomponents φi(i= 1,...,m)describethelocalproportionofthediﬀerent
phases. In particular, φis constrained to the set of pure phases {φ= (φ1,···,φm)∈
{0,1}m:φ1+···+φm= 1}. Correspondingly, the vector of varifolds V= (V1,···,Vm)

5.Topology optimization
Inthis section, we build ontheabovetheory andtackle a probleminto pologyoptimiza-
tion [1,8]. With respect to more classical settings, the novelty is two fold here. Firstly, in
line with this note’s general approach, the problem’s description is fu lly Eulerian, which
naturallycorresponds to thelarge-deformationsetting. Second ly, thecurvature ofthema-
terial interface is taken into account. The penalization of the curv ature of the boundary
of the body, in additionto its surface area, ﬁts well into applicative s ituations where sharp
edges should avoided. Indeed, in many mechanical applications shar p edges, especially
reentrant edges, may be subject to strong stresses and are of ten the onset of plasticization
and damage.
Given a deformation y: Ω→R3of an open, bounded Lipschitz domain Ω ⊂R3, we
interpret the image set y(Ω) as an a priori unknown design domain . This has to be
understood as a container, to be partially occupied by an elastic solid , whose actual
shape is the subject of the optimization procedure. We reinterpre t the phase indicator
φ:y(Ω)→ {0,1}as a descriptor of the optimal shape. More precisely, the deforme d
state of the body to be identiﬁed corresponds to the subset of y(Ω) where φ≡1. On the
contrary, the subset of y(Ω) where φ≡0 is interpreted as the deformed state of a very
compliant Ersatzmaterial, which is still assumed to be elastic. As customary in topology
optimization, in order to avoid trivial solutions, we prescribe the tot al mass by imposingˆ
Ωφ◦ydX=ηL3(Ω) (14)
for a ﬁxed parameter η∈(0,1).
As the deformation yis a priori unknown, for mathematical convenience, the scalar
ﬁeldφis deﬁned from here on on the whole space R3without changing notation. We will
refer to such a ﬁeld φ:R3→ {0,1}asEulerian material distribution in the following.
Given an Eulerian material distribution φ, we start by solving the equilibrium problem
with some appropriate boundary conditions in the referential conﬁ guration. More pre-
cisely, we let ∂Ω be decomposed into Γ D,ΓN⊂∂Ω, which are assumed to be open (in the12 K. BRAZDA, M. KRU ˇZ´IK, F. RUPP, AND U. STEFANELLI
topology of ∂Ω) with Γ D∩ΓN=∅,ΓD∪ΓN=∂Ω (closure taken in the topology of ∂Ω),
andH2(ΓD)>0. The body is assumed to be clamped on Γ Dand the set of admissible
deformations reads
Y={y∈W1,r(Ω;R3) :yis a homeomorphism , y= id on Γ D}.
In addition, a traction g∈L1(ΓN;R3)is exerted at theboundary partΓ Nandthematerial
is subjected to a force with given force density f∈L1(Ω;R3). Force and traction could
also be assumed to be formulated in Eulerian coordinates, as well.
For allη∈(0,1) ﬁxed, the set of equilibria related with φis deﬁned as
Y(φ) = argmin/braceleftbigg
Ebulk(y,φ)−ˆ
Ω(φ◦y)f·ydX−ˆ
ΓNg·ydH2:
y∈ Yis such that (14) holds/bracerightbigg
. (15)
By following the arguments from the proof of Theorem 7, one readily checks that Y(φ)
is not empty, provided φis such that the constraint (14) is satisﬁed by some y∈ Y. To
this aim, we will assume that the identity is admissible in (14), i.e.,´
ΩφdX=ηL3(Ω).
For such φ, even if nonempty, Y(φ) may not be a singleton, for equilibrium deformations
could be not unique.
Our goal is to minimize the compliance
C(y,φ) =ˆ
Ω(φ◦y)f·ydX+ˆ
ΓNg·ydH2
which is a measure of the elastic energy stored by the deformed piec e at equilibrium.
In order to describe the curvature of the Eulerian interface, we a ugment the description
of the material by an oriented curvature varifold, which we relate t oφas in Section 3.
Recalling Afrom Deﬁnition 4, the topology optimization problem reads
min/braceleftBig
C(y,φ)+Eint(y,V) :φ∈L∞(R3),/ba∇dblφ/ba∇dbl∞≤1,ˆ
ΩφdX=ηL3(Ω)
y∈ Y(φ),(y,φ|y(Ω),V)∈ A/bracerightBig
. (16)
The main result of this section is the following.
Theorem 9 (Topology optimization) .Problem (16)admits a solution.
Proof.Let us ﬁrst check that the inﬁmum in (16) is not ∞. To this aim, we construct
an admissible triplet in the domain of the functional. Let φ0= 1H∈SBV(R3;{0,1}),
whereH⊂R3is a half-space with L3(Ω∩H) =ηL3(Ω). Call P0=∂H⊂R3and let
N0∈S2be the unit normal vector to P0pointing towards the interior of H. Moreover,
letV0∈CVo
2(R3) be as in (2) with M=P0,νM(x) =N0,θ+(x) = 1, and θ−(x) = 0 for
x∈M. This entails in particular that V0andφ0are coupled in R3. Now,y0= id and
φ0satisfy the constraint (14), so by the discussion after (15), the setY(φ0) is not empty.CURVATURE-DEPENDENT EULERIAN INTERFACES 13
Let now y∗∈ Y(φ0) be given. We readily check that ( y∗,φ0|y∗(Ω),V0/rightanglesw(y∗(Ω)×S2))∈ A.
Moreover, as P0being a plane implies Aq♯V0≡0, we have that
C(y∗,φ0|y∗(Ω))+Eint(y∗,V0/rightanglesw(y∗(Ω)×S2)) =C(y∗,φ0|y∗(Ω))+Ψ(0)H2(P0∩y∗(Ω))<∞,
sincey∗∈W1,r(Ω;R3),r >3, implies that y∗(Ω) is bounded.
Let (yn,φn,Vn) be an inﬁmizing sequence for problem (16). By comparing with the
identity in (15), we observe that Y(φn) is bounded in W1,r(Ω;R3), independently of
n∈N. We may argue as in the proof of Theorem 7 to conclude that, after passing to
a not relabeled subsequence, there exist φ∈L∞(R3),y∈ Y, andV∈CVo
2(y(Ω)) with
(y,φ|y(Ω),V)∈ Asuch that in particular
yn→yinC0(¯Ω;R3). (17)
φn⇀∗φinL∞(R3), φn→φinL1
loc(y(Ω)), (18)
φn◦yn→φ◦yinL1(Ω), (19)
and, we have by lower semicontinuity and (18) that /ba∇dblφ/ba∇dbl∞≤liminf n→∞/ba∇dblφn/ba∇dbl∞≤1, as
well as
Ebulk(y,φ)≤liminf
n→∞Ebulk(yn,φn), (20)
Eint(y,V)≤liminf
n→∞Eint(yn,Vn). (21)
Equation (17) and (19) also imply
C(y,φ) = lim
n→∞C(yn,φn). (22)
As the mass constraint (14) passes to the limit under (19), from (1 7), (19), and (20) we
get thaty∈ Y(φ). Hence, owing to inequality (21) and the convergence (22) we con clude
that (y,φ,V) solves the topology optimization problem (16). /square
Remark 10 (Worst-case-scenario compliance) .Given the Eulerian material distribution
φ, the set Y(φ) may contain more than one equilibrium, for uniqueness may genuinely
fail [35]. In order to tackle this indeterminacy, one could consider so lving a topology
optimization problem (16) where the compliance C(y,φ) is replaced by the worst-case-
scenario compliance
Cmax(φ) = max
y∈Y(φ)C(y,φ).
Note that Cmax(φ) can be proved to be well-deﬁned, as soon as Y(φ) is not empty.
To treat the worst-case-scenario-compliance case, however, o ne needs to require some
stability oftheset C(φ)⊂ Y(φ)givenbythose equilibria y∈ Y(φ)realizing themaximum,
namely, such that C(y,φ) =Cmax(φ). A condition which would ensure the validity of an
existence result in the spirit of Theorem 9 would be
∀φn, φ∈L∞(Ω),/ba∇dblφn/ba∇dbl∞,/ba∇dblφ/ba∇dbl∞≤1, φn→φinL1(Ω),∀y∈ C(φ),
∃yn∈ Y(φn) :C(y,φ)≤liminf
n→∞C(yn,φn).
The latter entails the existence of a recovery sequence for each e quilibrium y∈ C(φ).
In particular, it is trivially satisﬁed in case the set of equilibria Y(φ) is a singleton, i.e.,
in case of uniqueness. Even in the case of nonuniqueness, the abov e condition holds if14 K. BRAZDA, M. KRU ˇZ´IK, F. RUPP, AND U. STEFANELLI
C(y,φ) takes the same value for all y∈ Y(φ). This is for instance the classical case of
buckling of a rod under longitudinal compression.
Remark 11 (A referential formulation) .The fully Eulerian setting above can be compu-
tationally challenging. One could resort to a more classical referent ial setting by identi-
fying the optimized body via ϕ: Ω→ {0,1}deﬁned on the ﬁxed reference conﬁguration,
while still retaining the penalization of the curvature of the referen tial boundary of the
body, in addition to its referential surface area. In this setting, t he volume constraint
(14) can be simpliﬁed to /ba∇dblϕ/ba∇dbl1=ηL3(Ω) for some given η∈(0,1). The set of equilibrium
deformations related with ϕis deﬁned as
Y(ϕ) = argmin
y∈Y/braceleftbiggˆ
Ω/parenleftBig
(1−ϕ)W0(∇y)+ϕW1(∇y)/parenrightBig
dX−ˆ
Ωϕf·ydX−ˆ
ΓNg·ydH2/bracerightbigg
which can be readily checked to be not empty. By deﬁning the referential compliance as
Cref(y,ϕ) =ˆ
Ωϕf·ydX+ˆ
ΓNg·ydH2,
the referential topology optimization problem reads
min/braceleftbigg
Cref(y,ϕ)+ˆ
Ω×G2,3Ψ(Aq♯V)d(q♯V) :ϕ∈SBV(Ω;{0,1}),/ba∇dblϕ/ba∇dbl1=ηL3(Ω),
y∈ Y(ϕ), V∈CVo
2(Ω), ∂TV= 0, ϕandVare coupled in Ω/bracerightbigg
.(23)
Note that the varifold Vis now deﬁned in the ﬁxed set Ω ×S2, and we are using the
same notation of Section 2.2. By arguing along the lines above, one ca n prove that the
referential topology optimization problem (23) admits a solution.
