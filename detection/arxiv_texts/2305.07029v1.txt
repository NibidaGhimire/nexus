Abstract
Over the past few decades, the phase-eld method for fracture has seen widespread appeal due to the many benets
associated with its ability to regularize a sharp crack geometry. Along the way, several dierent models for including
the eects of pressure loads on the crack faces have been developed. This work investigates the performance of these
models and compares them to a relatively new formulation for incorporating crack-face pressure loads. It is shown how
the new formulation can be obtained either by modifying the trial space in the traditional variational principle or by
postulating a new functional that is dependent on the rates of the primary variables. The key dierences between the new
formulation and existing models for pressurized cracks in a phase-eld setting are highlighted. Model-based simulations
developed with discretized versions of the new formulation and existing models are then used to illustrate the advantages
and dierences. In order to analyze the results, a domain form of the J-integral is developed for diuse cracks subjected
to pressure loads. Results are presented for a one-dimensional cohesive crack, steady crack growth, and crack nucleation
from a pressurized enclosure.

The propagation of pressurized fractures is a physical
phenomena of interest or concern in many dierent elds
of engineering. Some examples include hydraulic fracture
(fracking) treatments in the oil and gas industry [1, 2], pres-
sure vessel rupture [3], fracture in concrete dams [4] and
fuel fracture in nuclear reactors [5, 6]. Therefore, predic-
tive simulation tools for this phenomena have been inten-
sively studied in recent years. One of these tools is the
phase-eld method for fracture [7]. Initially developed for
traction-free cracks, the method has since been extended
to account for pressure loading on the surfaces of cracks,
as in [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. These various formulations exhibit
real dierences in terms of their structure and form when
it comes to how the pressure loads are incorporated. The
objective of this work is to examine the impact of the var-
ious choices, and to compare them to a relatively new for-
mulation for pressurized crack surfaces in a phase-eld for
fracture context [13]. The main contributions of this work
are: (a) to show that established formulations for pressure-
driven fracture in the phase-eld context have limitations
when cohesive processes are involved; (b) to demonstrate
that the new formulation, derived from variational princi-
ples, can address these limitations and be easily combined
with phase-eld models of cohesive fracture; and (c) to il-
lustrate the advantages and disadvantages of the various
models in terms of accuracy in obtaining various quantities
of interest.
Phase-eld methods for fracture regularize sharp crack
representations through the use of a scalar phase or damage
eld whose evolution is governed by minimization princi-
ples. Such methods rst appeared, in dierent forms, in the
works of Bourdin et al. [7] and Karma et al. [14]. The model
introduced in Bourdin et al. [7] was obtained by a regular-
ization of the variational formulation of fracture developed
in Francfort and Marigo [15], using ideas from Ambrosio and
Tortorelli [16]. It has been widely adopted in the mechanics
community and extended for use in a variety of fracture me-
chanics problems, such as ductile failure [17, 18, 19, 20, 21],
hydraulic fracture [22, 23, 24, 25, 19], dessication problems
[26, 27, 28, 29], dynamic fracture[30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36],
fracture in biomaterials [37, 38, 39, 40, 41] and many more.
Some recent reviews can be found in [42, 43, 44].
With regard to the use of the phase-eld method for hy-
draulic fracture problems, one challenge concerns how best
to incorporate surface loads that result from pressures on
crack faces that are diuse. One approach is to regular-
ize the resulting surface tractions with an approach that
is very similar to how the crack surface energy is regular-
ized. Early work along these lines focused on crack sur-
faces loaded by constant pressures, as in Bourdin et al. [8]
and Wheeler et al.[9]. Since these early developments, these
models have been used extensively for the study of pressur-ized fractures, for example in [45, 46, 47, 48]. They were
also extended and modied to account for uid ow inside
the fractures and poroelasticity in the surrounding medium
[19, 24, 23, 22, 25, 49, 50]. The reader is referred to the
recent review by Heider [51] for additional works on phase-
eld methods for hydraulic fracture. The various models
all employ some form of \indicator function" that assists in
the regularization of the surface load itself. Despite several
dierent indicator functions being proposed, the implication
of the particular choice of indicator on the accuracy of the
models has yet to be thoroughly examined.
In this manuscript, a new formulation for the study of
pressurized fractures, rst proposed in the thesis of Hu [13]
is also examined. In particular, it is studied in combi-
nation with a cohesive version of the phase-eld for frac-
ture method, which was proposed in the recent works of
[52, 53, 54]. This facilitates the study of pressurized frac-
ture in quasi-brittle materials and reduces the sensitivity of
the eective strength to the regularization length. To en-
sure that the cohesive fracture behavior is preserved, the
implicit traction-separation law is evaluated for a simple
one-dimensional problem and shown to be insensitive to the
applied pressure with the new formulation. Fracture initia-
tion and propagation examples are also examined to high-
light advantages and limitations of the model.
As part of the analysis conducted to evaluate the vari-
ous formulations, the J-integral is used to verify the extent
to which mode-I crack propagation occurs when the energy
release rate reaches the critical fracture energy. The con-
tour form of the J-integral and its modications for some
common cases of phase-eld fracture has been examined by
others, see e.g. the work of [55], [56] and [57]. In the case
of pressurized cracks, the contour version of the J-integral
is not path independent. Many prior works have focused on
developing domain forms of the J-integral for sharp cracks
that are domain independent [58, 59]. In this work, a do-
main form of the J-integral that is suitable for pressurized
phase-eld cracks is developed for the rst time.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a simple
model for pressure-induced fracturing is presented and the
new phase-eld formulation is derived in two dierent ways.
Section 3 provides the derivation of the domain form of the
J-Integral for pressurized phase-eld cracks. In Section 4,
the discretization scheme using nite elements is presented.
Then, in Section 5 some fundamental examples involving
crack nucleation and propagation are used to illustrate the
performance of the various models and choices of indicator
functions. Finally, some concluding remarks and directions
for future work are discussed in the last section.
2. Model
The formulation for treating pressurized cracks in a phase-
eld setting, rst introduced by Hu [13], can be derived
2in two dierent ways. In what follows, it is rst derived
based on energy minimization in quasi-static conditions in
subsection 2.1. This illustrates the main dierence in the
underlying hypothesis for this new model compared to the
widely used formulations of [8] and [10], for example. A sec-
ond derivation based on a maximum dissipation principle is
then provided in subsection 2.2.
The following assumptions are invoked for both deriva-
tions. A linear elastic body 
 2Rn(n= 2 or 3), containing
cracks denoted by   is considered (Figure 1). The bound-
ary@
 is partitioned as @
 =@
D[@
N, where@
D
represents the portion of the boundary where displacements
are prescribed and @
Nthe portion where tractions are ap-
plied. Deformations and rotations are assumed to be small,
so that a small-strain formulation is appropriate. For sim-
plicity, body forces are neglected.
2.1. Quasi-static derivation

p
 t
Figure 1: Generic body containing cracks loaded in pressure.
The quasi-static derivation of the formulation begins by
considering the potential energy of a body with cracks which
are internally loaded with a pressure p. Crack propagation
is associated with a critical fracture energy density, Gc. The
total potential energy is given by

in which uare the displacements, (u) =rsudenotes the
innitesimal strain,  ethe strain energy density, tthe exter-
nally applied tractions and nthe unit normals of the crack
set   (oriented outwards from 
).In a phase-eld for fracture setting, the crack surface   is
regularized with the aid of a scalar phase (or damage) eld
d(x)2[0;1]. In this work, d= 0 represents intact material
(away from the crack surface) and d= 1 fully-damaged ma-
terial (inside the crack). The damage eld is employed in
the approximation of the surface integrals in (1) as volume
integrals. For the energy associated with fracture, several
common formulations are encapsulated by the approxima-
tion

where(d) denotes a local dissipation term, `is the regu-
larization length, and c0is a normalization constant given
byc0= 4R1

(s)ds.
Such a regularization implies that the distinct crack sur-
face   is no longer dened. As such, the second integral on
the right of (1) also needs to be approximated as a volume
integral in some manner. This is eected with the use of an
indicator function I(d). The surface integral involving the
pressure is then approximated as

Note that the crack surface normal nis approximated as
 rd=krdk, whereas the dierential surface element dA be-
comeskrIkdV. The indicator function must satisfy I(0) =
0,I(1) = 1 and be monotonically increasing. In Bourdin
et al. [8],I(d) =dwas rstly proposed. Wheeler et al. [9]
provide a derivation that avoids an explicit approximation
of the normal, such as (3), but is in fact equivalent to using
the indicator function I(d) = 2d d2. In Peco et al. [11]
and Jiang et al. [12], I(d) =d2is used, with the motivation
thatI0(0) = 0 is required to avoid the eects of pressure in
undamaged areas.
Combining the approximation in (3) with the traditional
phase-eld approximation of fracture based on the Ambrosio-
Tortorelli functional [7] and applying the chain rule, the
regularized counterpart of (1) is given by

where the explicit dependence of the strain on the displace-
ments has been dropped.
Often, the strain energy density is split and part of it is
degraded with the damage, i.e.
 e((u);d) =g(d) +
e((u)) +  
e((u)); (5)
3whereg(d) denotes the degradation function, and  +
e((u))
and  
e((u)) denote the \active" and \inactive" parts of
the energy. The above form encapsulates most of the strain
decompositions used in the literature [60],[61] to introduce
asymmetry in the fracture behavior in tension and com-
presssion.
Typically, a minimization principle is applied to (4) to
extract the governing equations for the displacements uand
the damage d. According to this principle, a pair ( u,d)
is a valid state if and only if all neighboring states ( u+
u,d+d) have a greater potential energy. In the case
of pressurized cracks, a subtle consideration leads to the
formulation proposed herein. Consider the two scenarios
indicated in Figure 2. In the situation depicted in Figure
2b, the pressure load (applied in the areas colored in blue), is
assumed to accompany any crack propagation. Therefore,
in an energetic analysis, the virtual crack extension dais
assumed pressurized. By contrast, in Figure 2a, the pressure
load is assumed to remain conned to the original crack
geometry during propagation. As a result, the virtual crack
extensiondais not subject to any surface load.
In terms of the resulting formulation, the dierence be-
tween the two scenarios shown in Figure 2 translate into the
question of whether or not the damage variation dshould
enter the pressure work contribution (3).
For the family of formulations that were developed based
on the early work of [8] and [9], the scenario depicted in Fig-
ure 2b is assumed as a consequence of including the damage
variationdin (3). The proposed model in this work, by
contrast, assumes the case indicated by Figure 2a. Although
these competing views are expected to give rise to negligi-
ble dierences in results in the limit as da!0, in practice
the two formulations do give rise to slightly dierent sets of
governing equations. As we will demonstrate in the numer-
ical examples in Section 5, in practice these dierences can
translate into fairly signicant dierences in the results.
In what follows, the formulation associated with Figure
2a will be referred to as the Unloaded Virtual Crack formu-
lation, or UVC for short. In the UVC, the variation of the
pressure work is simply1,

[8], two additional terms have to be accounted for,

ones derived from [8] or [9], for example, in which the govern-
ing equation for the damage eld contains additional terms
to account for the pressure loads on the virtual cracks. In
what follows, we refer to that as the Loaded Virtual Crack
formulation, or LVC. In the boxes below, the governing
equations for the UVC are compared to those of the LVC.

: (20)It is readily apparent that the governing equations for
the displacements are identical in the UVC and the LVC.
The main dierence is in the absence of the additional pressure-
dependent terms in the evolution for the damage eld and
the accompanying boundary condition.
In Appendix A, an analytical study of the energy release
rate of a crack propagating under an arbitrary pressure load
p(x) is provided, under the assumptions of the UVC formu-
lation and linear elastic fracture mechanics. The results of
the study show that it is possible to recover the classic re-
lationship between the energy release rate and the stress
intensity factor with the UVC formulation. This ensures
the consistency of the proposed formulation (UVC) with
many theoretical works [62, 63, 64, 65, 66] in the eld of
hydraulic fracture, where the stress intensity factor is used
as the propagation criteria.
2.2. Derivation using the maximum dissipation principle
In this subsection, an alternative approach to derive the
(UVC) formulation is presented. It is based on the con-
struction of a total potential functional which depends on
the rates of the internal variables _;_dand accounts for the
work of the pressure load as an external dissipation mech-
anism. This approach is described in more detail in [21]
and [13], where it is used to derive a variationally consistent
phase-eld model for ductile fracture.
The total potential is postulated as

_u(_;_d)dV Pext; (21)
whereuis the material internal energy, which relates to the
Helmholtz free-energy  through _u=_ +_Ts, whereTis the
temperature and sthe entropy. In this work, only isother-
mal processes are considered, therefore, _ u=_ . The term
Pextdenotes the external power expenditure. If cracks were
represented by internal boundaries   instead of a damage
eld, one could write,

to the following expression for Las a function of  :

2.3. Constitutive choices of the phase-eld formulation
In the previous subsection, the proposed model for pres-
surized cracks was developed for a general phase-eld regu-
larization of the variational approach to fracture [15], with
a free-energy of the form

In what follows, the constitutive choices used in the example
problems provided in Section 5 are described.
2.3.1. Elastic energy and decomposition
First, in terms of the solid bulk response, an elastic en-
ergy of the type (5) is assumed. When the material is un-
damaged, it reduces to a purely linear elastic energy, that
is,
 e((u);0) = +
e((u);0) +  
e((u);0) =1
2(u) :C:(u);
(36)
where Cis the elasticity tensor.
When damage is present, a decomposition of the energy
is often assumed. In many cases, when the applied load to a
fracturing body is predominately tensile, the \no-split" case
given by,
  
e((u);d) = 0! e((u);d) =1
2g(d)(u) :C:(u);
(37)
is capable of correctly predicting the material response, while
leading to a simpler set of governing equations. However,
in a wide-range of scenarios, compressive forces are present,
and an energy split is needed to prevent crack formation in
zones of high compression, as well as to allow for transmis-
sion of compressive forces across fractured faces.
In Section 5, one of the example problems will employ
the spectral split of Miehe et al. [61], given by
6 +
e((u);d) =1

e((u);d) =1

Here,hi+andhi denote the positive and negative
parts of a number respectively, while +and are the
positive and negative parts of an additive decomposition of
the strain tensor based on the signs of its eigenvalues. A
more detailed description, including the derivation of the
stiness matrix in this case, is provided by Jiang et al. [67].
2.3.2. Brittle fracture
The rst and more traditional phase-eld model with an
energy of the type (35) was proposed in [7]. It was developed
to approximate the brittle fracture process of linear elastic
materials in the limit of vanishing `. In its original form,
the degradation function
g(d) =+ (1 )(1 d)2; (40)
is used in combination with a quadratic local dissipation
(d) =d2, in what is now called the AT-2 formulation.
However, the use of, (d) =d, (widely referred as the AT-1)
comes with the advantage of a purely elastic response be-
fore the onset of damage and a compactly supported damage
eld. Therefore, it will be employed in the example in Sec-
tion 5 where brittle fracture is investigated. The parameter
>0 in (40) is a small residual stiness used to avoid a loss
of ellipticity in simulations with fully damaged material.
2.3.3. Cohesive fracture
The phase-eld model for cohesive fracture was rst pro-
posed by Lorentz et al [52, 68]. In this model, the use of a
quasi-quadratic degradation function, given by
g(d) =+ (1 )(1 d)2
(1 d)2+md(1 +pd); (41)
is combined with a linear local dissipation function (d) =d.
The parameter mis dened as m=Gc

to form. The parameter pis a shape parameter that can
be used to adjust the traction-separation response. In this
work,p= 1 is used.
3. A J-Integral for pressurized cracks in a phase-
eld setting
This Section presents a modied J-integral, capable of
retrievingGin the case of pressurized cracks in a phase-
eld for fracture setting. The resulting integral is then re-
cast into a domain-independent form that is more amenable
to nite-element calculations.A common form of the J-integral, derived for phase-eld
fracture and applicable to traction-free cracks is given by
[55, 56]
J=rZ

nds; (42)
where (;d) is given by equation (35). In the above, the
vector rdenotes the crack propagation direction, is a
closed path around the crack tip, Iis the second-order iden-
tity tensor, nis the normal to the closed path and!=
@ =@rd= (Gc`=c0)rd. Compared to the original form
of the J-integral proposed by Rice [69, 70], this expression
contains additional terms to account for the phase-eld pa-
rameterd.
Importantly, Sicsic and Marigo [55] show that, under cer-
tain conditions, the standard form of the J-integral widely
employed for sharp cracks, viz.
J=rZ

 e(;d)I ruT
nds; (43)
can be used in a regularized phase-eld setting. These con-
ditions are:
H1: The regularization length is suciently small, so that
a separation of scales between the solution in the dam-
age band and the outer solution can be achieved;
H2: The path intersects the crack plane at a ninety-
degree angle;
H3: The path intersects the crack plane suciently far
from the crack tip, so that the damage eld only varies
in a direction perpendicular to the crack plane.
In what follows, these same conditions are assumed, as they
facilitate a simpler derivation of a modied J-Integral capa-
ble of retrieving the energy release rate even in the presence
of pressure loads on the crack faces. The main result of this
section can then be stated in the following way.
Claim : Consider a domain

eld crack and two closed, non-intersecting paths inand
outaround the crack tip, enclosing an area  as shown
in Figure 3a. Let q(x) be a sucently smooth function

the fracture is loaded by a constant pressure p, and that one
of the formulations described in Section 2 holds. Then, if

remainder of , outside of the damage band. In the asymp-
totic limit as `!0, the material in  outer behaves as purely

this gives

Following [8], the second integral on the right approaches

therefore this term is O(B), so,

since the damage band half-length Bscales with the reg-

Finally, combining (46), (52) and (58), one obtains

4. Finite Element Implementation
In this Section, the details of the nite element dis-
cretization used to obtain approximations to the solution
of the proposed model (UVC) are described. For analogous
equations for the model (LVC), the reader is referred to [12].
First, the strong form of the governing equations, derived
from the general free-energy (35) using the KKT[72, 73]
conditions is presented.

Observe that (74) is an equality rather than an inequal-
ity, such as (65). This reects a view ahead, toward dis-
cretization, where in the present work the irreversibility con-
straint is enforced with an active-set strategy. The active set
strategy eectively partitions the domain into active (where
_d= 0) and inactive (where _d>0) parts. Only the inactive
part requires a discretization of the damage condition (65),
where it is indeed treated as an equality. A detailed descrip-
tion of this constrained optimization algorithm is given by
Heister et al. in [74], and some additional details pertinent
to phase-eld for fracture discretizations can be found in Hu
et al. [75].
Finally, these function spaces can be discretized over a
nite element mesh, that give rise to the discrete function
spaces Uh

In this work, bilinear nite elements are used to approx-
imate the damage and displacement elds.
The coupling between the two discrete equations 76 and
77 is handled by an alternating minimization scheme. A
detailed description of this scheme is given in [75]. This so-
lution scheme is implemented using RACCOON [76], a par-
allel nite element code specializing in phase-eld fracture
problems. RACCOON is built upon the MOOSE frame-
work [77, 78] developed and maintained by Idaho National
Laboratory.
5. Results
We now present results for a set of problems that high-
light the advantages, as well as some limitations, of the var-
ious models for pressurized cracks in a phase-eld for frac-
ture setting. In the rst problem, the cohesive fracture of an
uniaxial specimen in a pressurized environment is analyzed.
We then consider the problem of crack nucleation from a
pressurized hole in a media subjected to far-eld, biaxial
compression.
Finally, a crack propagation example is studied to verify
that in the limit of a vanishing regularization length Grith-
like behavior is recovered with the new model. In all cases,
plane-strain conditions are assumed to hold.
In the course of explaining the results obtained with the
cohesive phase-eld model, it will be useful to characterize
the eective cohesive strength cof the material. To that
end we will rely on the following relationship between the
cohesive strength and the nucleation energy:
c=s
2E c
(1 2); (79)
whereEdenotes Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio.
This equation results from the analysis of a one-dimensional
10system subjected to uniaxial loading [53], and should be
viewed as an approximation to the cohesive strength in more
general loading conditions.
5.1. Uniaxial bar under traction in a pressurized environ-
ment
We consider the fracture behavior of a cohesive material
with pressure loading on the crack faces. The example is in-
tended to examine the extent to which the pressure loading
can articially inuence the apparent traction-separation
law on the crack surface.

The problem consists of a bar under a displacement con-
trolled load in a pressurized chamber, as shown in Figure 4.
The bar is assumed to be made of a linear elastic material
that undergoes cohesive fracture, with a traction-separation
lawF(s).
The bar has an undeformed length 2 L= 400 mm and
width 2W= 2 mm. The material properties are given in
Table 1. Symmetry boundary conditions are invoked to re-
duce the computational domain to the top-right quarter of
the bar. The applied load is modeled as a displacement
boundary condition on the right end of the domain. The
mesh consists of rectangular elements of size halong the
length direction and size 1 mm in the width direction. The
initial applied displacement increment is  u= 510 4mm.
The displacement increment is adaptively rened when con-
vergence is not obtained within a xed set of iterations. A
more detailed description of the adaptive stepping proce-
dure is provided in [77, 78, 79].
Damage localization is triggered by introducing an small
initial defect ( d=O()) on the left side of the domain. In
what follows, results are reported using `=L=20 = 10 mm
andh=`=10 = 1 mm. This choice of regularization lengthand mesh spacing was found to yield spatially-converged
results. Dierent values of pressure, ranging from 0 to c=3
are considered.
The problem is simulated using discretized versions of
both the UVC and (LVC) formulations.
For the indicator function I(d), results are reported for:
(1)I(d) =d, used for example in [8]; (2) I(d) =d2, used
in [12] and (3) I(d) = 2d d2, used in [9]. The eective
traction-separation laws extracted from the set of simula-
tions are shown in Figure 5. To generate these curves, the
traction is computed as the internal force measured in the
center of the bar. The separation sis the opening of the
crack, calculated as s= 1R
 1urI(d)dx [8].
The results for the various models are shown in Figure 5,
with tractions and pressures normalized by the critical stress
cfrom (79). As shown in Figure 5, the proposed model
(UVC) exhibits minimal sensitivity to the pressure magni-
tude in the traction-separation behavior. By contrast, with
the (LVC) formulation, only the case with I(d) = 2d d2
exhibits comparable results. In the other two cases (Figures
5a and 5b), the apparent traction-separation law shows a
spurious dependence to the applied pressure. This is evi-
dent in the variations in the results as well as the presence
of jumps in the aperture at suciently high pressures. The
latter occur due to an instability of the partially damaged
solutions as dapproaches 1. More precisely, shortly after
the damage at the center of the bar reaches d0:8, it
jumps tod= 1, which in turns lead to a jump in the aper-
ture. This jump is indicated via the squares that appear
on selected curves in Figures 5a and 5b. The use of smaller
displacement increments was not observed to signicantly
impact these results. By contrast, such instabilities were
not observed for the simulations reported in Figures 5c and
5d.

5.2. Crack nucleation from a pressurized hole
Consider a square plate of dimensions LL, with a cir-
cular hole in the center subjected to an internal pressure p,
as shown in Figure 6a. This problem is motivated by oil
and gas wellbore systems. Far eld stresses VandHare
applied as tractions on the boundaries as shown. The pres-
sure is increased until it reaches a \breakdown pressure" pb.
When that happens, cracks initiate in the direction parallel
to the maximum in-situ stress. Assuming H>V, this is
expected to occur along a horizontal axis passing through
the center of the hole. In this work, the pressure in the hole
is assumed to follow the crack faces as the fracture grows
into the interior of the domain.
The material properties selected for this problem, along
with the dimensions and loading parameters are listed in Ta-
ble 2. The material properties are taken to be representativeof a Bebertal sandstone, as inspired by the experiments of
[80].
The symmetry of the problem is exploited to reduce
the computational domain to the top-left quarter. An un-
structured triangular mesh is used, with local renement
along thex-axis, as shown in Figure 6b. The element size
in the rened area is 10mm, whereas the phase-eld reg-
ularization length is `= 40mm. For the results reported
in this section, the phase-eld model employs the cohesive
formulation[52, 53] using the degradation function (41) and
the spectral split of [61].
Intuitively, the magnitude of the pressure load required
to initiate fracture in this problem is expected to be inde-
pendent of whether or not the pressure follows the crack
evolution. After initiation, the pressure eects become im-
portant and the fracture propagates unstably. Due to this

unstable behavior, it is very dicult to numerically capture
the crack path after the pressure pbis reached. In order
to have a glimpse into what this path looks like, a viscous
term_dis added to the phase-eld equation, as in [61], with
= 10 3mJmm 3s.
It bears emphasis that the equations (9) and (11) in-
dicate that, in the absence of any damage, the proposed
model for pressurized cracks reduces to the standard phase-
eld fracture model for traction-free cracks. Therefore, one
should expect the proposed model to capture fracture initi-
ation properly in this scenario. On the other hand, for the
(LVC) formulation, this only occurs if the indicator function
satisesI0(0) = 0. Among the many works which use the
(LVC) formulation, only a few such as [12, 11] used an indi-
cator function satisfying this condition. In [12], the authors
were indeed able to predict fracture initiation from pressur-
ized holes. To highlight the implications of having I0(0)6= 0
in the model (LVC), the results for this problem will also be
presented using the (LVC) formulation with the indicator
functionI(d) =d.
The nal damage patterns obtained using the (UVC)formulation and the (LVC) formulation are shown in Figure
7. With the (UVC) formulation, damage localizes along the
midplane when the hoop stress is approximately 85% of c.
This is not unexpected, as the expression (79) is based on
a one-dimensional state of stress and strain which diers
signicantly from the state near the corner of the hole. The
same comparison is not performed for the simulation using
the model (LVC), since damage forms only on the boundary
in the rst steps leading to spurious rigid body motion.
The main takeaway is that the proposed model (UVC)
allows one to study crack nucleation and subsequent prop-
agation under a pressure load, whereas formulation (LVC)
leads to spurious damage formation if I0(0)6= 0. The pres-
ence of the term pruI0(d) in the damage equation (19)
drives crack formation in areas which are not stressed. For
this specic problem, this issue can be circumvented using
for example I(d) =d2, as shown in [12], but this option
introduces a spurious dependence of the cohesive response
of the material on the applied pressure, as indicated in the
last section (Figure 5b).
5.3. Stable propagation of a pre-existing crack
Consider a strip of material with a pressurized crack, as
shown in Figure 8a. The rectangular strip has a width W,
heightHand a crack with initial size a(values provided
in Table 3), and is loaded by the \surng" boundary con-
ditionfUy(x;y;t ) on its top and bottom surfaces [57]. The
boundary condition is given by
fUy(x;y;t ) =Uy(x Vt;y ); (80)

and where randare polar coordinates with respect to
the origin, taken to be the midpoint of the left edge of the
domain. The constant V > 0 is the target crack speed,
prescribed by moving the boundary condition following (80).
The Kolosov constant is dened as = 3 4in plane strain
and the shear modulus =E=(2 + 2). The pressure p
applied to the crack faces as the crack evolves is given by

in whichadenotes the initial crack length. This value cor-
responds to half the critical pressure for an innite plate
with a pressurized crack of size a. This magnitude ensures
that the applied pressure is considerably large, but not so
large as to drive the problem beyond the stable propagation
regime.
To calculate the energy release rate, the domain form
of the J-integral (44) developed in Section 3 is used. The
functionqis constructed by taking advantage of the nite
element interpolation. In essence, the domain for the J-
integral is taken to be a single rectangular region of dimen-
sionsaH=2, centered on the initial crack tip. The value of
qfor all nodes outside of this region is set to 0, while q= 1
for all nodes inside. Using the nite element interpolation,
this gives rise to a qfunction whose value changes contin-
uously from 0 to 1 on the elements cut by the rectangular
path. This function is illustrated in Figure 8b2.
In order to verify that Grith's law is approached as
`!0, simulations are performed for this problem using a
sequence of decreasing regularization lengths, ranging from
2Due to mesh renement near the crack surface, the width of the
band where 0 <q< 1 diminishes near the horizontal centerline of the
domain.Table 3: Parameters used for pressurized crack propagation problem

thex-axis, where the element size is set to h=`=4. The
symmetry of the problem is exploited and only the response
in the top half of the domain is simulated.
In terms of constitutive choices of the phase-eld model,
the AT-1 formulation is employed without any decomposi-
tion of the strain.
As in the previous examples, this problem is analyzed
using the formulations (LVC) and (UVC), and the following
choices of indicator function I(d):
•I(d) =d
•I(d) =d2
•I(d) = 2d d2

J-Integral and the eective critical fracture energy Geff

especially when the indicator function I(d) =dis used.
This is expected given the results obtained in [8]. Never-
theless, these results serve to verify the implementation of
the J-Integral presented in Section 3. They also provide an
estimate for how small the regularization length has to be in
order to achieve a certain level of accuracy with these types
of phase-eld models.

trial cracks, as discussed in Section 2. Although the dierent
assumptions converge to the same propagation rule in the
limit of an innitesimal crack increment, in the discretized
case, the minimal crack increment is nite and related to the
mesh spacing hand regularization length `. In this case, a
slightly dierent propagation behavior, resulting in slower
convergence rates towards J=Geff
c= 1 is not surprising.
6. Concluding Remarks
This manuscript examines various models for phase-eld
fracture incorporating pressure loads on diuse crack faces.
This includes the analysis of a new formulation that can be
obtained by considering the presence of the pressure load in
the virtual extension of a crack, or alternatively through a
careful accounting in the minimization procedure. The new
formulation is referred to as the \unloaded virtual crack
formulation"(UVC). In order to verify the accuracy of the
various models for propagating cracks, a new form of the
J-Integral for pressurized cracks in the phase-eld context
is derived.
The (UVC) formulation proposed herein allows for a
unied treatment of crack nucleation and propagation in
scenarios involving either brittle or cohesive fracture, and
provides for better accuracy in some problems compared
to existing formulations of the (LVC) type. As it allows
for the use of the same governing equation for the damage
parameter, its computational implementation within exist-
ing phase-eld solvers is also simpler. In future work, its
applicability to problems involving plastic deformation and
strength-based fracture nucleation will be studied. In addi-
tion to that, modications to accelerate the convergence of
the model with respect to the phase-eld parameter `will
also be considered.

16Appendix A. Equivalence to SIF condition
In this appendix, the energy release rate for a single,
straight crack under an arbitrary pressure load p(x) is com-
puted, assuming that innitesimal crack increments are trac-
tion free, as shown in Figure 2a. Grith's criteria states
that propagation should happen whenever this energy re-
lease rate, which will be denoted by G, reachesGc. This will
give rise to a condition for propagation based on the pres-
sure distribution p(x), the crack size aand Young's modulus
E04. The purpose of the following derivation is to demon-
strate that this condition is equivalent to the stress intensity
factor criteria [81].
Initially, consider the Sneddon-Lowengrub solution for
the aperture of a pressure loaded crack in an innite plate,
under plane strain conditions,
w(x) =4a
E0Z1
0p(sa)Z(x=a;s )ds (A.1)
where
Z(r;s) = logp
1 r2+p

1 r2 p

is a convolution kernel. The work done by the pressure load
is then,
Wp=Za
 apwdx=Za
 ap(y)4a
E0Z1
0p(sa)Z(x=a;s )dsdy:
(A.3)
Clayperon's theorem [82] states that the potential energy is
negative half of the work exerted in the boundary, which, in
this case is only Wp. Hence
U= 1

 apwdx

Let's write the energy release rate, assuming that the pres-
sure eld doesn't vary as the crack advances by a small
amount da. That is,
pa+da(x) =(
pa(x);ifxa
0; ifaxa+ da(A.5)
dU=U(a+ da;pa+da) U(a+ da;pa); (A.6)

By symmetry, both tips of the crack propagate with the
same energy release rate, so, one can write,

From a simple inspection, one can see that G=K2
I=E0,
which guarantees the equivalence of the energy release rate
criteria under the assumption in Figure 2a and the stress
intensity factor condition. If instead, one assumes that the
pressure load in the vicinity of a propagating crack behaves
as in Figure 2b, this equivalence between the energetic cri-
teria and the stress intensity factor may be violated.
