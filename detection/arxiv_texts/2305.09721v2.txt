1 INTRODUCTION
Hydrogenintheintergalacticmedium(IGM)wasprogressivelyion-
ized by light from the first galaxies during the epoch of reionization
(Barkana & Loeb 2007). This process began a few 100 Myr after
the Big Bang (roughly ùëß‚âà15‚àí30), and ended when the Universe
was over 1 Gyrold, byùëß‚âà5.3, as inferred in Planck VI (2018). Di-
rect observations of galaxies at these high redshifts are challenging,
requiring long integration times, techniques such as strong lensing
(Atek et al. 2018), or new telescopes such as JWST. Our knowledge
ofearlygalaxypopulationsandthesourcesofcosmicreionizationis
correspondingly limited.
Becausereionizationisdrivenbytheionizinglightofgalaxies,the
progress of reionization is coupled to the population of galaxies in
theearlyUniverse.Therefore,wecanlearnaboutthesefirstgalaxies
byobservingthegasintheIGM.Forinstance,studiesoftheLyman-
alpha transmission in the spectra of distant quasars (e.g. Fan et al.
2006;Beckeretal.2013;Eilersetal.2018;Yangetal.2020;Bosman
etal.2021)informusofthetime-frameofreionization,aswellasthe

these techniques will not allow us to probe far beyond ùëß=6due to
‚òÖE-mail: lewis@iap.frthe increasingly large column densities of neutral hydrogen. This is
where the 21cm line of atomic hydrogen plays a crucial role.
The 21cm signal amplitude from a particular volume traces the
densityofneutralhydrogengas,itstemperatureandvelocity,aswell
asthelocalradiationfield(seeFurlanettoetal.2006,forareviewof
thephysics).Thus,thesky-averagedsignaltracestheglobalprogress
of reionization and constrains first light. Already, there has been
a reported detection of the global signal for ùëß > 10by EDGES
(Monsalve et al. 2017), though this is strongly contested by results
fromSARAS-3(Bevinsetal.2022).Atthesametime,interferometry
and 21cm tomography can probe the heterogeneity of reionization:
experiments such as LOFAR (Mertens et al. 2020), MWA (Trott
et al. 2022) and HERA (Abdurashidova et al. 2022b) have begun to
provideupperlimitsonthepowerspectrumofthe21cmsignal.Over
thecomingdecades,new21cmobservatorieswillseefirstlight(e.g.
the Square Kilometer Array; Koopmans et al. 2015).
In order to interpret this new data, we must understand the astro-
physical processes and underlying reionization scenarios that shape
the 21cm signal. Existing theoretical work can be divided into sev-
eralcategoriesbasedontheapproach.Analyticalmodelspredictthe

cosmological and universal astrophysical parameters.
Cosmologicalhydrodynamicalsimulations,ontheotherhand,di-
rectlymodelbaryonicmatter,theformationofstars,andthecomplex
non-linear coupling of physical processes across spatial scales and
matter components. In particular, the implementation of stellar and
supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation, and the correspond-
ing feedback onto gas, are essential to regulate star formation and
reproduce realistic galaxies (e.g. Dubois et al. 2014; Schaye et al.
2015; Pillepich et al. 2018a). Star formation and feedback models
can fundamentally alter, for example, the stellar mass to halo mass
relationship, in turn modifying the number and distribution of ion-
izing sources that drive reionization, and shape the 21cm signal at
ùëß‚â≤10. Feedback from star formation and SMBHs can also vary lo-
cally and over time, significantly affecting the distribution of matter
in and around galaxies (e.g. Ayromlou et al. 2022), modulating the
matter clustering also on ‚â≥Mpc spatial scales (e.g. Springel et al.
2018), heating the gas (e.g. Zinger et al. 2020) and determining the
gas velocity structure in and around galaxies and haloes (Nelson
et al. 2019b; Pillepich et al. 2021). All this can manifest itself dif-
ferentlyatdifferentcosmicepochs.However,simulationsthatdonot
model radiation transfer on the fly must treat reionization in post-
processing,eitherwithexcursionsettechniques(Hutter2018;Hutter
etal.2019)orbyfullradiativetransfermethods(e.g.Georgievetal.
2022;Semelinetal.2017;Baueretal.2015).Asaresult,runningcos-
mologicalhydrodynamicalsimulationsaswellasvariantstoexplore
the relationship between the 21cm signal and different underlying
galaxy formation models is more expensive than with analytical or
semi-analytical models.
Cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy simulations must also ac-

et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2019), again potentially leaving an imprint
on the 21cm signal. This effect can be captured with fully coupled
radiative transfer simulations, where the gas ionization and heating

21cm signalbefore IGMheating, one musttrack theproduction and
transfer of Lyman‚àíùõºphotons to account for the Wouthuysen-Field

on following the formation of H2-cooled mini-haloes, subsequent
photo-dissociationofthemoleculargas,andthetransitionfromPop
III to Pop II stars (Klessen & Glover 2023).
Ideally, simulations must track the radiative transfer of all of the
relevant photons in a fully coupled radiation and hydrodynamics
(RHD)simulation.Todate,severalsimulationprojectshavedoneso,
focusing on reionization in a representative volume (for most EoR
statistics i.e. ‚â≥1003Mpc3; see Iliev et al. (2014)), such as: CROC
(Gnedin 2014), CoDa (Ocvirk et al. 2016, 2020; Lewis et al. 2022),
Aurora (Pawlik et al. 2017), and THESAN (Kannan et al. 2021).
These efforts are increasingly successful at reproducing constraints
on the ionization of the IGM. One should also note the SPHINX
simulations (Rosdahl et al. 2018; Katz et al. 2021), that focus on
more detailed but smaller volumes, and have been leveraged to in-
vestigatee.g. Lyman‚àíùõºemissionduringtheEoR(Gareletal.2021).
Because of the high computational expense of fully coupled RHD,
simulations of volumes large enough to fully account for the effects
ofcosmicvarianceon21cmstatisticsdonotyetresolvegalaxies(e.g.Semelin et al. 2007). Others couple approximate RT methods to the
hydrodynamics (e.g. Davies et al. 2023).
In this paper we aim to strike a middle ground, by relying upon
existing large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galax-
ies and by post-processing them to model reionization. Our goal
is to compare predictions for the 21cm signal of hydrogen during
reionization. In particular, we use the outcome of three cosmologi-
cal simulations (Illustris, IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, see Section 2)
and contrast their predictions to quantify the link between different
galaxyformationmodelsandthe21cmsignal.Thesesimulationsal-

maps, moving on to the average global signal, and finally the 21cm
power spectra. To explain these findings, we study statistics about
the IGM gas and galaxies in Sec. 4. We finish with our concluding
remarks in Sec. 5.
2 METHODS
2.1 Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies
In this paper, we investigate the 21cm signal from three cosmologi-
calhydrodynamicalgalaxysimulationssuites:Illustris,IllustrisTNG,
and Eagle. We base our analysis on the similar, roughly 1003Mpc3,
volumes. All three simulation projects feature models that account
for the star formation and baryon feedback physics required to form
reasonably realistic galaxies by ùëß=0. However, significant differ-
ences exist in the implementation, parametrization, and outcome
of these models. Whereas these have been compared to each other
and to observational constraints across a diverse set of galaxy and
large-scale structure properties at low redshifts (e.g. Somerville &
Dav√© 2015; Vogelsberger et al. 2020), here we focus on the effects
ofthedifferentunderlyinggalaxy-formationmodelsontheresulting
21cm signals during the epoch of reionization. In fact, differences
in the feedback models across these three simulations are expected
to impact the temperature and density of gas in the environments of
galaxies, in turn altering the 21cm signal from these regions.
2.1.1 Illustris
The original Illustris simulation (Vogelsberger et al. 2014; Si-
jacki et al. 2015; Genel et al. 2014), encompasses a volume of
110.73Mpc3, resolved by 18203particles and an equal number of
gascellsattheinitialconditions.Eachdarkmatterparticle(gascell)
has a mass of 6.29√ó106M‚äô(1.26√ó106M‚äô). Dark matter and
stars haveùëß=0gravitational softening lengths of ‚àº1.4 kpc, while
the gas softenings are adaptive down to ‚àº0.7 kpc. Illustris was per-
formed with the moving-mesh code arepo(Springel 2010), which
solvesthecoupledequationsofgravity,galaxyastrophysics,andhy-
drodynamics in expanding universes by adopting, for the former, an
N-body Tree-PM scheme and, for the latter, a Riemann solver on an
unstructured Voronoi mesh.
The Illustris galaxy formation model (Vogelsberger et al. 2013;
Torrey et al. 2014) includes the key physics thought to be responsi-
ble for galaxy formation, and we here summarise the main aspects,

cools radiatively, via hydrogen and helium collisional processes,
bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton cooling off the CMB (Katz
et al. 1996), in addition to metal-line cooling. It is heated by a
spatially uniform, though time-variable, background radiation field
(Faucher-Gigu√®re et al. 2009).
The unresolved dense star-forming ISM gas is modeled with a
sub-resolution two-phase model, which partitions star-forming cells
into cold and hot phases (Springel & Hernquist 2003). Stars can
form from the cold phase via a stochastic generation of discrete
stellarparticles,aboveathresholddensityof ùëõùêª=0.1 cm‚àí3.These
represent stellar populations that form simultaneously, following a
Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF). Galactic-scale winds
due to supernova feedback are modeled with a kinetic decoupled
wind scheme (Springel & Hernquist 2003), which is effective at
regulating the star formation of lower mass galaxies.
SMBHs are seeded in all sufficiently massive dark matter haloes
(‚â≥7√ó1010M‚äô). They subsequently grow over time via smooth
gas accretion and SMBH-SMBH mergers. Feedback from SMBHs
is modeled via three channels: thermal (or quasar), mechanical (or
radio), and radiative. Thermal or quasar-mode feedback heats the
nearbygas,occursforSMBHswithhighaccretionrates,andistime
continuous. Mechanical or radio-mode feedback takes the form of
energyinjectedintothehalobyjet-inflatedbubbles,isimplemented
forSMBHswithlowactivitystates,andistimestochastic.Finally,the
radiative feedback directly alters the local radiation field, reducing
the effectiveness of cooling in nearby gas.
2.1.2 IllustrisTNG
The three IllustrisTNG simulations, TNG100 and TNG300 (Nelson
etal.2018;Springeletal.2018;Marinaccietal.2018;Naimanetal.
2018;Pillepichetal.2018b)andTNG50(Pillepichetal.2019;Nel-
son et al. 2019b), are the successors to Illustris and are also based
onthecode arepo.Herewefocusontheintermediatevolumesimu-
lation, TNG100, which spans 110.73Mpc3and which has the sameinitial conditions random seed as Illustris. TNG100 has 2√ó18203
dark matter particles and initial gas cells, with corresponding parti-
cle/cellmassesof 7.5√ó106M‚äôand1.4√ó106M‚äô(slightlydifferent
than Illustris because of the different values of the cosmological
parameters ‚Äì see Section 2.1.4).
The TNG galaxyformation model has severalsignificant changes
withrespecttoIllustris,suchastheinclusionofmagneticfields(see
Pillepichetal.2018a,foranoverview).Herewefocusonthemodel
differencesthatcouldaffectthegasoverthelargescalespertinentto
the study of the 21cm signal.
First, the low accretion state SMBH feedback model is replaced
by a more local, kinetic feedback channel. The SMBH seed mass
wasalsoincreased,compensatingfortheremovaloftheboostfactor
in the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate (see Weinberger et al. 2017, for a
fullreviewofthemodifiedAGNfeedbackandSMBHphysics).The
updated SMBH feedback model produces a more realistic massive
galaxy population (Donnari et al. 2019; Rodriguez-Gomez et al.
2019; Nelson et al. 2019b). Second, the galactic winds generated
by stellar feedback are updated in a number of aspects, including
metallicity-dependent energetics, isotropy of the energy input at the
injection scale, and the introduction of a redshift scaling of launch
velocity. Overall TNG has stronger and faster winds, particularly at
high redshift, producing important heating and enrichment around
star-forming galaxies at early times (Pillepich et al. 2018a).
We also analyse ‚Äúnon-radiative‚Äù runs of the TNG100 simulation
in which we deactivate much of the baryonic physics: cooling, star
formation and feedback. This TNG100-NR simulation has the same
initialconditionsandresolutionasTNG100,enablingdirectcompar-
isons. Its behaviour is closer to the assumptions made in analytical
(and some semi-analytical approaches) regarding baryonic matter.
It also serves as a control for the physics that we wish to study in
thispaper.Inthissimulation,wheretherearenocollisionalorradia-

2.1.3 Eagle
TheprimaryEaglesimulation(Schayeetal.2015;Crainetal.2015)
has a volume of 100.03Mpc3, resolved by 15043dark matter and
15043gas particles. This results in a slightly lower resolution, with
darkmatter(gas)particlesmassesof 9.7√ó106M‚äô(1.81√ó106M‚äô).
Eagleusesamodifiedversionofthesmoothedparticlehydrodynam-
ics code gadget-3 (Springel 2005).
Thoughmanyofthephysicalingredientsforgalaxyformationare
largely similar as in Illustris and TNG, their implementations are
different. First, there is no sub-grid two-phase ISM model. Instead,
star-forminggasfollowsaneffectiveequationofstate.TheChabrier
(2003) IMF is also adopted, while the stochastic star-formation
scheme relies on a metallicity dependent density threshold. Third,
stellarfeedbackfromTypeIISNeismodelledbyastochasticthermal
injectionschemeasdescribedinDallaVecchia&Schaye(2012),as
opposed to the kinetic schemes of the other two simulations. This
heats nearby gas to very high temperatures to produce effective out-
flows. Third, SMBHs are seeded in lower mass ( >1010M‚äô) haloes.
Fourth,thefeedbackfromSMBHsisalsomodelledbyasinglether-
malchannel(asopposedtothreechannelsofIllustrisandTNG),and
is time integrated rather than continuous (Booth & Schaye 2009).
2.1.4 Cosmologies and data structure
Illustris assumes cosmological parameters consistent with WMAP
9 (Hinshaw et al. 2013): Œ©ùëö=0.2727,Œ©Œõ=0.7274,Œ©ùëè=
0.0456, ùúé8=0.809, ùëõùë†=0.963, ùêª0=70.4 kms‚àí1Mpc‚àí1.
The TNG simulations assume updated cosmological parameters
from Planck XIII (2016): Œ©ùëö=0.3089,Œ©Œõ=0.6911,Œ©ùëè=

Planck XVI (2013) cosmology was assumed for the Eagle sim-
ulations, with Œ©ùëö=0.307,Œ©Œõ=0.693,Œ©ùëè=0.04825, ùúé8=
0.8288, ùëõùë†=0.9611, ùêª0=67.77 kms‚àí1Mpc‚àí1. In this work, dis-
tances are always given in comoving units.
The data of these three simulations, both catalogs and particle-
based data, are publicly available and described by Nelson et al.
(2015), The EAGLE team (2017), Nelsonet al. (2019a) for Illustris,
EAGLEandTNG,respectively.Inallthreesimulations,darkmatter
haloes and galaxies were identified using, consecutively, a Friends-
of-Friends and the SUBFIND algorithms (Springel et al. 2001).1
2.2 UV/X-ray background and temperature of the IGM
Illustris, TNG and EAGLE are notfully coupled radiation and hy-
drodynamics(RHD)simulationsandthereforetheydonotexplicitly
model the heating from ionizing photons (UV and X-ray) that orig-
inate from galaxies and SMBHs. Hydrogen reionization is imple-
mented by activating a time-dependent, spatially-uniform ionizing
background(UVB).InthecaseofEagle,thisisadoptedfromHaardt
& Madau (2001) and turned on at ùëß=11.5(Schaye et al. 2015).
Illustris and TNG also include a UVB, from Faucher-Gigu√®re et al.
(2009), which is only turned on at ùëß=6. Therefore, prior to ùëß=6,
in Illustris and TNG100 the IGM is cold ( ùëá‚â™104K), whereas any
non-negligible UVB would act to heat this gas to ‚àº104K.
Tomodelmorerealisticgastemperaturesat ùëß>6onthelargespa-
tial scales of the IGM, we recalculate gas cell temperatures in post-
processing. To do so we re-run the TNG model cooling network for

sityIGMgas,thishappensrelativelyquickly(in ‚â≤10 Myr)compared
to the time separation of snapshots ( >40 Myr), avoiding transitions
between snapshots. As the heating is done in post-processing, we
cannot consistently account for heating due to gravitational effects,
and stellar and AGN feedback. Therefore, in cells that are already
hotterthantypicaltemperaturesfromphoto-ionization( >2√ó104ùêæ),
we retain the original simulation temperatures.
We verify this approach with a variation of the TNG100-3 sim-
ulation ‚Äì a run of the same TNG100 volume with the same ini-
tial conditions, unchanged galaxy-formation model but with 64 (4)
timesworsemass(spatial)resolution‚ÄìwheretheUVBwasincluded
for allùëß < 11. This resolution is sufficient to capture effects in
the low-density IGM, where we modify temperatures. Adopting a
power law for the temperature-density relation in low density gas
(ùëõH<10‚àí3cm‚àí3),wefind<8%relativedifferenceintemperatures
between the full UVB run and our equilibrium approach. Further-
more, a comparison of the average IGM temperature of TNG, Illus-
tris, and Eagle to observational constraints (which we do not show)
returnsabroadagreement(withe.g.Boeraetal.2019;Gaikwadetal.
2020),whichissatisfactoryforthiscomparativestudy(asitdoesnot
focus on modeling the most realistic Reionization).
This post-processing allows us to model the temperature in the
IGM when heating has already finished ( ùëß‚â≤8‚àí10, see Ciardi
& Madau 2003). At higher redshifts, our simulations and post-
processing cannot account for some of the physical effects that are
importantintheearlyheatingoftheIGM.2Consequently,throughout
this paper, we refrain from making predictions for ùëß>8.

and adopt an approach similar to Mao et al. (2012) as implemented
in the tools21cm software package (Giri et al. 2020). For every

2.4 Deriving ùë•HIin post-processing
As mentioned in Section 1 and described in Section 2.3, the 21 cm
brightness temperature directly depends on the fraction of neutral
hydrogen gas and thus on its density. In TNG, Illustris, and Eagle,
the fraction of neutral hydrogen gas in each resolution element is
determined by a balance between collisional processes computed
fromthegasstate,andphoto-heatingandphoto-ionisationprocesses
computedusingauniformultra-violetbackground(UVB).ThisUVB
represents the combined emission of all ionising sources.
3We find a small‚â§3%mean difference in the final 21cm power spectrum
atùëß=6when switching LoS directions.In practice, the UVB is applied to all gas in a spatially uniform
manner.Thus,inthesesimulations,theIGMisprogressivelyionized

order to determine the ionization fractions of hydrogen and helium

lowcomputationalexpensewhencomparedtofullradiativetransfer.
For our use case CIFOGallows post-processing of the simulations
to capture varying star formation and galaxy formation models in
order to assess their imprint on the 21cm hydrogen emission line.
For precise details about CIFOG‚Äôs design and examples of its use,
we refer the reader to Hutter (2018) and Hutter et al. (2020).
With CIFOGwegenerateoutputsatthesameredshiftsforallthree

several orders of magnitude during the final ‚âà100Myr of reioniza-
tion,wetake CIFOGoutputsseparatedby ‚âà20 Myrtosamplerapid
changes in the 21cm signal.
2.4.2 Eulerian grid
CIFOGonly supports Eulerian input grids of size 2ùëõ(withùëõan
integer). We also require an evenly sampled grid to compute the
power spectrum of the simulation fields. We therefore construct a
set of Eulerian grids for the density, temperature, and line of sight
velocity fields of each snapshot, for each simulation. For the bulk
of the analysis, we choose a grid of 10243cells, giving a spatial
resolution of roughly Œîùë•‚âà100 kpc(depending on the simulation).
Thisspatialresolutionisadequateforresolvingthelargespatialscales
thatcanbeconstrainedbycurrentornear-termfutureobservationsof
the21cmemissionlineofhydrogen(seee.g.Koopmansetal.2015;
Kolopanis et al. 2019, 2022; The HERA Collaboration et al. 2021).
We use the standard cubic-spline kernel with an adaptive size
and deposit gas mass and mass-weighted gas properties accordingly
into the Eulerian grid (following Nelson et al. 2016). For TNG and
Illustris the kernel size is the spherical volume-equivalent radius of
each Voronoi cell. For Eagle, we use the SPH adaptive smoothing
length.Rarely,lowdensityvoidregionsarenotsampled,andinthese
cases we infill the grid values from nearest neighbor values.4
With CIFOGwe save regularly spaced outputs of the ùë•HIfield,
4In the Eagle SPH simulation, this occurs in regions not within the hydro-
dynamical softening length of any particle. In the AREPO Voronoi mesh
simulations, this happens in cells between and around Voronoi cells who‚Äôs
geometries are not well described by a sphere, as is assumed when using the
cubic-spline kernel. In these cases we fill empty grid cells with the values
fromthenearestgascell.Notethatthisprocedureintroducesasmallincrease

obtaining more CIFOGoutputs than simulation snapshots. This is
particularly true for ùëß > 6and in Eagle, for which we only have
3 snapshots covering the 6‚â§ùëß‚â§8interval. When necessary we
associate each ùë•HIfield to the closest in redshift snapshot. Where

DuetothecoarseresolutionofourEuleriangrid,andtheapprox-
imate treatment of radiative transfer performed by the CIFOGcode,
we must account for the absorption of ionizing photons by neutral
HI gas as they travel from stellar sources to the IGM heuristically.
We take the simplest choice and assume a constant fraction of all
produced photons are absorbed by dense neutral galactic gas. The
corresponding escape fraction is therefore an effective value, that
doesnotevolveintime,oraccountforanydependenciesongalactic
properties (as increasingly suggested by simulations, for instance:
Rosdahletal.2022;Kostyuketal.2022).Nevertheless,similarmod-
els are widely used, particularly in analytical and semi-analytical
approaches (e.g. Dayal et al. 2020). We calibrate the escape frac-
tion (ùëìesc) using the timing of reionization in TNG100, finding a
reasonable result for ùëìesc=0.2(ùëì20%esc).
2.4.4 Fiducial post-processing model
Puttingtogetherthemethodologiesdescribedabove,throughoutthis
paper we adopt the following fiducial choices to obtain a prediction
of the 21cm brightness temperature from the Illustris, TNG100 and
Eagle simulations. We assume that the spin temperature ( ùëás) is cou-
pled to the gas temperature ( ùëágas). We adopt ionizing luminosities
of stellar populations from the binary BPASS V2.2.1 stellar evolu-
tion model (Eldridge & Stanway 2020). We assume a fixed escape
fraction of 20%. We then derive the mass fraction of ionized gas in
each cell, using the source and hydrogen density distributions from
each simulation, with CIFOG. Our fiducial model for the brightness
temperature of the 21cm line accounts for redshift space distortion
(RSD) along the line of sight.

tions discussed above.
5The ionizing radiation from AGN is only thought to become important at
lowerredshifts,basedontheirlowdensityduringreionization(e.g.Kulkarni
et al. 2019b), and results from simulations (Trebitsch et al. 2021).2.5 Computing power spectra
Beyonditsspatialaverage,themostinformativeandaccessiblesum-
mary statistic of the 21cm brightness temperature is its 2-point cor-
relation function, or power spectrum.

The smallest scales we probe are limited by the grid resolu-
tion, while the largest are limited by the simulation box sizes. In
our case this corresponds to the interval ùëò‚àà [‚âà 0.06 cMpc‚àí1,‚âà
58.49 cMpc‚àí1]. However, the power spectra at the largest scales
(smallest k) suffer from under-sampling, and those at the smallest
scales (largest k) are susceptible to aliasing. Throughout the paper

3 RESULTS
3.1 Maps of the 21cm brightness temperature
Figure 1 shows slices of differential brightness temperature |ùõøùëáb|,
where each panel is ‚âà100 Mpc a side, atùëß=8,7,6in TNG100,
Illustris, and Eagle. Emission peaks occur at the overdensities in
filaments and galaxies. As time progresses, more and larger regions
of lowùõøùëábappear. These are mainly driven by the formation and
growth of ionized bubbles around collapsed structures.
There are many similarities among the simulations, particularly
between TNG100 and Illustris as they share the same initial condi-
tions.However,differencesduetostarformationandgasdistributions
are also apparent. The TNG100 and Eagle maps have more, smaller
bubbles of low ùõøùëáb(ionized HI bubbles), when compared to Illus-
tris,butalsomorebubblesoverall.Thissuggeststhatthedistribution

3.2 Evolution of the average 21cm brightness temperature
The left panel of Fig. 2 shows the redshift evolution of the average
brightnesstemperatureinTNG100,Illustris,andEagle.Themarkers
and thin lines show the evolution of ùõøùëábaccording to our fiducial
post-processingmodel(Section2.4.4).Forallthreesimulations, ùõøùëáb
decreases over time as the volume filling factor of ionized hydrogen
increases, and the total volume where ùõøùëáb‚âà0increases.
We predict a lower signal in Eagle across all redshifts. Illustris
and TNG100 are similar at ùëß=8, while the signal decreases faster
in TNG100 and is closer to the Eagle result for ùëß‚â≤6. Differences
inùõøùëábbetween TNG100 and Illustris arise from their unique feed-
back prescriptions. This is likely also the case for differences in the
ùõøùëábof Eagle, as they cannot be explained by differences in large
scale density (closer than 2%). The shaded regions show a level of
modeling uncertainty representing the breadth of all explored post-
processing models (described in Appendix A). Broadly, the Illustris
and TNG100 models are the closest, whereas Eagle-based models
ofùõøùëábshow the largest scatter in values, lying below the other two
simulations for most model combinations.
The middle panel of Fig. 2, shows the evolution of the average
ùõøùëábas a function of the spatially-averaged neutral fraction (average
ùë•HI).Thisaccountsfordifferencesinreionizationhistoriesacrossthe
simulations and source models. As expected, ùõøùëábdecreases rapidly
with decreasing average ùë•HI, and the three predictions of ùõøùëábare
strikingly close at fixed ùë•HI, irrespective of the underlying hydrody-
namical galaxy simulation. The Eagle model variants are again the
most diverse from the fiducial model.
Gillet et al. (2021) perform full RHD simulations, with sub-grid
models for star formation and luminosities based on smaller, more
resolved RHD simulations. They report a similar evolution of the
brightness temperature as ours from Illustris, TNG100 and Eagle,
particularly when compared to Eagle. On the other hand, we find
significantly higher temperatures than the analytical result (in the
saturatedcase)fromMirochaetal.(2017).However,whenaccount-
ing for our different reionization histories, our results are close to
their predictions near ùëß=6, and they are even closer to the RHD
simulation results of Gillet et al. (2021).
3.3 Power spectra of the 21cm brightness temperature
Fig. 3 quantifies the fiducial power spectra of the 21cm brightness
temperature, ùõøùëá2

21, and the fiducial reionization histories from
TNG100, Illustris, Eagle, and TNG100-NR (see Section 2.1.2). We
focuson theepoch between ùëß=8andùëß‚àº6.For allsimulations and
times, the 21cm power spectrum increases with decreasing spatial
scale, reflecting the underlying matter density power spectrum and
the high variance in the density of baryons at small scales.
Broadly,allthepredicted21cmpowerspectrashowthesametime

ùëß=8andùëß=7,thelargescalevarianceinthebrightnesstemperature

et al. 2021, for recent similar findings).
Beyond this similar evolution of the 21cm power spectra across
different simulations, the values across scales also appear relativelyconsistentwithoneexception:bothTNG100andEaglehavesignifi-
cantlylesssmallscalepowerthanIllustrisandTNG100-NR.Finally,
although the reionization histories of the simulations are similar
(5.3< ùëß(ùë•HI=0.1)‚â§6for the fiducial model), they are not iden-
tical. For instance, Eagle starts reionization earlier than the other
boxesunderourfiducialassumptions.Thiscanbeenseeninthevery
low normalisation of 21cm power spectrum at ùëß=5.7in Eagle with
respect to the other simulations at the same redshift.
To directly compare the three simulations, the top row of Fig.
4 shows the 21cm power spectra at three redshifts (left to right),
with all simulations in each panel (TNG100, Illustris, Eagle, and
TNG100-NR). Overall and as qualitatively seen above, the 21cm
powerspectraareverysimilaracrosstheboard.Indeed,thechanges
produced by our various post-processing models and choices are of
the same order or larger than the differences across simulations at
fixedredshifts.Acrossscalesandforthefirsttwostudiedepochs(top
left two panels), the different predictions for each simulation show
similar trends and normalisation. In fact, the fiducial 21cm power
spectra of TNG100 and Eagle are similar for most small scales.
Thisissomewhatsurprisingas,althoughtheyarebothrecentgalaxy
formation simulations, they are only calibrated to produce realistic
galaxy populations at ùëß=0. In addition, the small-scale signals
of Illustris and TNG100-NR are similar. Both predict consistently
higher 21cm power spectra for all models at the smallest scales we
study. Since TNG100, TNG100-NR, and Illustris were run with the
same initial conditions, these changes stem solely from the galaxy
formationphysicalmodelsandthechoicesmadefortheirparameters.
The higher power on small spatial scales, according to Illustris
andTNG100-NR,likelyarisesduetodifferencesinthematterpower
spectrum of gas, that is the main contributing term to the 21cm
power spectra at small scales (Furlanetto et al. 2006). Feedback si-
multaneously smooths out baryons at small scales within galaxies,
whilepushingafractionofthesmallestscalepowertolargerscales.
Sincethesmall-scaledifferencesbetweenTNG100andIllustrismust
arise from the different prescriptions for star formation, and stellar
and SMBH feedback, and since TNG100-NR was run without star
formation or feedback and is very close at small scales to Illustris,
then the high-redshift feedback in Illustris is clearly weaker than in
TNG. These conclusions are consistent with the changes to the stel-
larfeedbackmodelbetweentheIllustrisandIllustrisTNGmodels.In
particular, high-redshift galactic winds have higher initial velocities
in TNG100 than in the original Illustris model (see Pillepich et al.
2018a, for more details).
In the top right panel ( ùëß=5.7), reionization is almost complete
in all the models: any large changes in the power spectra are set by
different average ùë•HI. Modulo this difference, which mostly affects
theoverallnormalisation,theshapeofthepowerspectraaresimilar.
We find our results to be quite similar across all scales to those
of Hutter (2018) at ùëß=7.8, that use CIFOGto post-process N-body
dark matter simulations. However, their fiducial prediction is closer
tosomeofourmodelvariantsthantoourfiducialmodel.At ùëß=6.3

Wefindthat,overall,ourvariouspredictionsaresimilar:allmod-

predictions. TNG100 and Eagle are very similar at small scales, as
commented upon above. In particular, the fiducial predictions from
Eagle and TNG100 are roughly within 15% for ùëò‚â•2 Mpc‚àí1, i.e.
at scales smaller than about 500kpc. At the same scales, and beforeùë•HI=0.3, Illustris predictions are almost identical to TNG100-NR,
and both have more power than Eagle and TNG100, by an amount
that increases up to 200 % by ùëò‚âà20 Mpc‚àí1.

4 DISCUSSION
4.1 Physical interpretation
4.1.1 Contributions to the 21cm power spectrum
Fig. 5 shows the largest contributing terms of the dimensionless
power spectrum of the 21cm brightness temperature, Œî2
21, that we
compute (as per Eq. 2) alongside the fiducial predictions from each
simulation, at three key moments of reionization. As before, in all
four simulations, the fiducial Œî2
21(solid thick curves) increases with
time at large scales. Here, we directly see the rise of the ùë•HIterm
(dotted) at large scales between average ùë•HI=0.85andùë•HI=0.3,
which drives a corresponding increase for the total 21cm power.
It has been extensively shown that the two most important com-
ponents to the 21cm spatial correlations are the gas density power
spectrum and the neutral fraction power spectrum (Furlanetto et al.
2006).Ourresultsechothesefindings:forallsimulationsandconsid-

Despite allowing for differences in the simulations‚Äô gas tempera-
tures stemming from choices in the implementation of feedback, we
find that accounting for temperature in our modeling does not sig-
nificantlydistinguishthe21cmpowerpredictionsofthesimulations.
This resemblance has two likely explanations: First, and foremost,wehavelimitedourselvestothepost-heatingepoch,sothattheIGM
gas in all three simulations is similarly hot. Second, it may be that
we do not consider small enough scales for the temperature of the
coolest, densest neutral clumps and the hottest outflows to signifi-
cantly impact the 21cm power.
4.1.2 Galaxy properties predicted by the different simulations
To understand the role of different source populations in creating
scale-dependent differences in the 21cm power spectra from simu-
lation to simulation, we consider the galactic properties predicted
by Illustris, TNG100 and Eagle and the underlying star formation
and feedback models at play. Figure 7 shows several properties of
galaxies as a function of dark matter halo mass at a representative
redshift ofùëß=7.
First, we examine the stellar mass of galaxies (top left panel,
panel A). Overall and for all simulations, the stellar mass increases
betweenùëÄh=108and3√ó1011M‚äô. This is expected as the more
massive haloes are able to accrete and concentrate more gas in spite
of stellar feedback, permitting more star formation. For the highest
mass haloes ( ùëÄh‚â≥2√ó1010M‚äô),ùëÄ‚òÖis a power law function of
ùëÄh. At these masses, the TNG100 and Eagle simulations are very
similar, whereas Illustris galaxies have on average somewhat more
stellar mass at fixed halo mass. For lower masses, stellar feedback
is efficient at suppressing star formation, and this results in a knee
in the average stellar mass to halo mass relation, giving way to a
stronger decrease of stellar mass with decreasing halo mass. The
mass at which this knee manifests itself arises from details in the
physical models of each simulation.6
Panel B shows the fraction of the total stellar mass contained in
each halo mass bin. In other words, it shows which halo masses
contain the most stellar mass. This is governed by two factors: the

abundance of galaxies decreases with increasing mass, and stellar
mass increases with halo mass. These competing trends give rise
to a halo mass interval that forms the highest fraction of all stars.
The resulting curves are strikingly different for each simulation. For
instance, stars in Illustris are more likely to form in >1010M‚äô
haloes than in the other two simulations. Indeed, the halo mass bin
that contains the highest fraction of stellar mass is 109M‚äôin TNG
versus 2√ó109M‚äôin Eagle and 1010M‚äôin Illustris. Further, the
most star forming halo masses contain somewhat different fractions
of the total stellar mass: ‚âà5% in TNG100 and Illustris, but 8
% in Eagle. Despite the differences between TNG100 and Eagle,

PanelCshowstheaveragemassfractionsforgas(solidlines)and
baryons (dotted lines). Each mass fraction is defined as the ratio
between the gas mass (or baryon mass) and the total mass of all
particles and cells associated with the SUBFIND sub-haloes (i.e.
gravitationally-bound material). As before, TNG100 and Eagle are
more similar to each other than to Illustris: the average baryon and
gas fractions in Illustris haloes is nearly constant with halo mass.
In contrast, the TNG100 and Eagle fractions are lower for all halo
masses, and decrease until a few 109M‚äô, above which they rise
with increasing halo mass. These differences between Illustris and
TNG100 haloes are driven by physical models changes, including
the non-monotonicity. In fact, there is no corresponding drop in the
total halo gas fraction in TNG100-NR. This indicates that the halo-
mass trends of panel C for TNG100 and Eagle are associated with
cooling, star formation, and feedback. The latter can expel gas from
theTNG100andEaglehaloes,whilstheatingtheirsurroundingsand
slowingaccretionofnewgasfromtheIGM‚Äìpredominantlyatlower
redshifts (e.g. Pillepich et al. 2018a).
The differing effectiveness of feedback between the simulations
explains why the haloes that contain the most stellar mass are more
massiveinIllustris.For >3√ó109M‚äô,haloesinEaglehavethelowest
average baryon and gas fractions, suggesting the strongest feedback
effects.TNG100-NRactuallyhasalowergasfractionthanTNG100,
despite its absence of feedback. This may be due to the lack of gas
cooling in TNG100-NR, slowing the accretion of gas into galaxies.
These differences are reflected in the 21cm power spectra, e.g. in
Fig. 5. The simulations with the highest gas fractions (Illustris and
TNG100-NR) also have the largest small-scale power in the spectra
of gas density. In TNG100 and Eagle, where the gas fractions are
lower, thegas density power isalso lower at smallscales (Schneider
& Teyssier 2015; van Daalen & Schaye 2015). We infer that stellar
feedback in TNG100 and Eagle is capable of evacuating gas from
galaxies out to‚â§Mpcscales (see Ayromlou et al. 2022, for a study
of large-scale feedback-driven gas redistribution).
4.1.3 Connecting galaxy properties to the ionizing luminosity
Wenowmovetoconnectthegalacticstellarmassestotheirionizing
luminosities, in the right hand panels of Fig. 7.
PanelDshowstheaveragegalaxyionizingluminosity(or ùêøintr).In
our source modeling (Section 2.4.3), at fixed stellar population age
and metallicitiy, the ionizing luminosity scales linearly with stellar
mass. Thus, the average ùêøintrincreases with halo mass, roughly as
ùëÄ‚òÖ. However, the conversion is not straightforward, because of the
dependence on stellar ages and metallicities, which are affected by
the detailed star formation and enrichment histories of individualgalaxies. Indeed, the highest mass haloes in Illustris appear to have
somewhathigheraverage ùêøintr,withrespecttotheothersimulations,
than theirùëÄ‚òÖalone suggests.
Panel E shows the fraction of the total ionizing luminosity pro-
duced in each halo mass bin. Qualitatively, this metric closely re-
semblesthestellarmasscounterpart(paneltotheleft).However,the
halo masses that contain the largest fraction of overall stellar mass
contain even larger fractions of the total ionizing luminosity. Fur-
ther, these masses are slightly lower for the luminosity curves than
for the stellar mass curves. As a result, the ionizing stellar photons
overwhelmingly (roughly 50 %) come from ‚âà109M‚äôhaloes in Ea-
gle, whereas in TNG100 and Illustris the ionizing sources are more
evenly distributed across halo masses. This implies different typical
sizesandspatialdistributionofionizedbubblesinEaglewithrespect
totheothertwosimulations,andcouldbeassociatedwiththehigher
ùë•HIpower seen in Eagle near ùëò‚âà0.8 Mpc‚àí1(Fig. 5).

ing that stellar age is the main driver of differences in the ionizing
luminosities of galaxies at fixed stellar mass.
The average age of TNG100 galaxies increases more rapidly at
lower masses than in the other two simulations, leading TNG100 to
have the lowest specific ionizing luminosities in low mass haloes.
Between 109M‚äôand5√ó109M‚äô, the average stellar age increases
rapidly in all simulations. This is most pronounced in Eagle, lead-
ing its ionizing luminosities to drop. Beyond this point, the typical
ages stagnate in Illustris, continue to rise in Eagle, and decrease in
TNG100.ConsequentlythespecificluminosityinTNG100increases.
For1010M‚äôandbeyond,thespecificluminositiesinEagledecrease
rapidly, converging with the other simulations for massive haloes.
These age comparisons map well to the differences between baryon
fractions: the oldest populations have the lowest baryon fractions.
When feedback suppresses star formation in a galaxy, the ionizing
luminositydecreasesviatwochannels.First,thereissimplylessstel-

and intermediate mass haloes ( ùëÄhalo‚â≤1010M‚äô), there are signifi-
cantdifferencesinthestellarmetallicities.Illustrisgalaxiesaremore
metal poor than in TNG100 and Eagle. However, the majority of
stars in this galaxy mass range are metal poor ( ùëçabsolute<10‚àí3),
falling below the minimum metallicities for which our stellar evolu-
tionmodelmakesionizingluminositypredictions.Thesedifferences
therefore do not affect the ionizing emissivities of galaxies. At the
sametime,themetallicitiesofthehighermasshaloesarefairlysim-
ilar. Overall, this confirms that the differences in specific ionizing
luminosity are mainly driven by differences in stellar population
ages, as a result of differing stellar feedback models.
4.1.4 The impact of different stellar populations
To further investigate the impact of the stellar ages and metallicities
forthe21cmpowerspectrum,weperformthefollowingtest.Wemake
a variant of the fiducial model and CIFOGrun for Eagle, where the
ionizing luminosity of the stellar particles is scaled as a function of
galaxy halo mass, so that the average ionizing luminosity per stellar

4.3 Implications
In this work we have quantified the differences among the predic-
tionsfromstate-of-the-artcosmologicalhydrodynamicalsimulations
of galaxies. A general result arises: across all scales and considered
epochs, our predictions for the global 21cm signal and the 21cm
power spectra are within a factor of a few, even without account-
ing for the different reionization histories of the simulations. This
is all the more impressive, as we have highlighted substantial dif-
ferences amongst the galaxy populations and drivers of reionization
in the different simulation volumes. When one considers the huge
diversity of predictions from SAMs, that span many orders (e.g.
Reis et al. 2020), our results appear to imply that many of these
models lie outside of possible outcomes from current cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. However, a large
fractionofthisdiversitystemsfromdifferentassumptionsregarding
the reionization and heating history of the Universe. Namely, our
resultsarearguablyinstrongdisagreementwithmodelsthatheatup
late, and/or reionize early. In addition, no observations at these high
redshiftshavebeenusedtoconstraintheunderlyinggalaxy-formation
and feedback models adopted e.g. in Illustris, TNG and Eagle.
The largest differences among the simulations occur, not surpris-
ingly,atsmallspatialscales(i.e.for ùëò‚â•10 Mpc‚àí1)wherethestrength
of supernova feedback models imprints a signature into the gas. At
these scales, the signature of the escape fraction model (see App.
A1) in the 21cm power is significantly smaller. As a result, future
upper limits on the 21cm power spectrum at these scales can con-
strainhigh-redshiftfeedbackmodels.Sucheffectsarechallengingto
account for in the many analytical or semi-analytical works in the
literature. In our approach, the resulting predicted differences in the
21cm signals are significant (up to a factor of two). However, they
are also relatively modest compared to the large range of theoretical
predictions. Thus, a significant leap in observations is needed to di-
rectly constrain these differences (e.g. Abdurashidova et al. 2022b;
Koopmans et al. 2015; Kolopanis et al. 2022; Trott et al. 2021).
Furthermore, at such small scales, it is more challenging to impose
upper limits on ùõøùëá2
bŒî2
21(due to larger thermal noise at small scales;
e.g. Abdurashidova et al. 2022a), limiting the feasibility of such a
constraint in the near future.
We also identify an excess of 21cm power near ùëò‚âà0.8 Mpc‚àí1
in Eagle with respect to the other simulations, due to topological
differencesinthe ùë•HIfield.Thisarisesfromalargedifferenceinthe
ionizing photon budget of haloes. In Eagle, most ionizing photons
are produced in‚âà109M‚äôhaloes atùëß=7, in much greater propor-
tion than in Illustris or TNG. The result is differences in the typical
ionized bubble sizes. We attribute these to feedback model choices,
asEaglegalaxieshavelowerbaryonfractions,andolderstellarpop-
ulations than TNG100 (the closest comparable simulation). Indeed
the more efficient feedback in massive Eagle galaxies makes theirstellar populations older, redder, and less ionizing. In fact, this lat-
ter manifestation of feedback appears to be the main driver of the
ùëò‚âà0.8 Mpc‚àí1bumpin21cmpowerinEagle.Althoughtherelative
difference in the resulting power spectra between the simulations is
small (at most 1.5 times greater in Eagle), these scales are easier
to observe. However, as we show in Appendix A1, changes to the
escapefraction(anditsdependenceonhalomass)canalsomanifest
similarly in the 21cm power. This complicates any interpretation of
the 21cm signal at these scales. Indeed, the ionizing luminosities of
galaxies are the product of stellar mass, ionizing efficiency, and es-
cape fraction. Thus, a low escape fraction could be misconstrued as
less efficient star formation, or stellar populations with low ionizing
efficiencies. Fitting observations with a model that parameterizes
all three of these aspects would therefore be challenging, as they
are highly degenerate. At the same time, this highlights the poten-
tial importance of accounting for these ionizing efficiency effects:
theymaybekeyinprovidingmoreaccurateionizingescapefraction
estimations from 21cm observations.
4.4 Limitations of the adopted methodology
Illustris,TNG100,andEagleallhavevolumesofroughly 1003Mpc3.
Although these are large volumes for galaxy formation simulations,
it has been shown (Iliev et al. 2014) that volumes of at least ‚âà
2003Mpc3are required to achieve convergence of ionized region
sizes, and large-scale 21cm power spectrum statistics. On top of
this,suchvolumeswouldallowustopredictmeasurementsatlarger
scales, where upper limits on the 21cm power spectrum are more
constraining. Although these larger volumes would be desirable for
ourstudy,wehighlighttheneedtocompromisebetweenvolumeand
resolutioninordertobeabletomodelgalaxiesrealistically,inorder
to accurately capture the impacts of feedback.
At the same time, our works relies on post-processing the
simulation-predicted fields, such as gas density and gas tempera-
ture, to determine the ionized fraction of hydrogen gas. This does
notallowustoaccountforthereactionofthegastophoto-ionization
andphoto-heatinginaself-consistentway,whichhasbeenshownto
have an important impact on the IGM (D‚ÄôAloisio et al. 2020), and
onthestarformationofgalaxies(Dawoodbhoyetal.2018;Wuetal.
2019; Borrow et al. 2022). Our approach does not rely on solving
the radiative transfer equations, but uses an approximate descrip-
tion using excursion set formalism with CIFOG(Hutter 2018). This
method does not explicitly conserve the number of photons, lead-
ing to excessive ionization. Moreover, we do not track the evolving
temperature of the gas, leading to inconsistencies. In particular, ùõøùëáb
in neutral regions could be artificially low, due to heating that only
occurs once the region is ionized (since the emission of the ionized
regionsis‚âà0,thereversesituationisnotproblematic).Inthefuture,
full RT post-processing will enable additional physical effects to be
captured, at the cost of additional computational expense.
Finally, in this work, we have focused exclusively on the ionizing
radiation from stellar sources, which are thought to be the domi-
nant drivers of reionization. As such, we do not model any ionizing
contribution from AGN, although ionizing photons from AGN are
accounted for in the simulation UVBs. However, they may play a
role,especiallyinlaterreionizationscenarios,whenahigherdensity
of luminous AGN are present.
We have also limited ourselves to times when the IGM has al-
ready been heated by a UV and X-ray background ( ùëß‚â≤8). The
prior-heating stage has a profound impact on the 21cm signal (e.g.
Pritchard & Furlanetto 2007; Fialkov et al. 2014; Ross et al. 2017),
and extending to such times would require explicitly implementing
MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì21 (2023)Galaxy formation models and the 21cm signal 17
and exploring separate X-ray source models, for AGN and X-ray bi-
naries, for reionization and patchy (i.e. source driven) heating. This

binaries).Additionally,whenmovingtohigherredshifts,themasses
of the galaxies producing the most of the UV and X-ray emission
decrease,aresolutionchallengeforthesimulationsconsideredhere.
Expanding to higher redshifts, when the heating of the IGM is not
yet complete, may reveal other differences among the simulations.
Finally,inourcurrentapproach,wehavealsorefrainedfromcom-
putingfulllightcones(asinChapman&Santos2019):ourapproach
ignores scattering events, breaks down for large optical depths, and
does not account for the width of the 21cm line. Further, our treat-

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Inthisworkwehavetakenadvantageoftherichbaryonicphysicsof
large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies to pre-
dict the emission from the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen in the
post-heating era ( ùëß‚âà6‚àí8). In particular, we have post-processed
the outcome of three simulations ‚Äì Illustris, IllustrisTNG (specif-
ically TNG100), and Eagle in order to compare and contrast their
predictions for 21cm observables. Our key results are as follows:
‚Ä¢The predicted global 21cm signal and 21cm power spectra of
Illustris,IllustrisTNG,andEaglearesimilar,withdifferencesuptoa
factorofafewatmost.Thesedifferencesareofthesameorderasthe
uncertainties in the post-processing modeling, even on small scales
(ùëò‚â•5 Mpc‚àí1).
‚Ä¢Variations between the predicted power spectra of the 21cm
brightness temperature at ùëß‚â≤8are mainly driven by large-scale
differences in the progress of reionization.
‚Ä¢On the smallest spatial scales, ùëò‚â•10 Mpc‚àí1, the three simu-
lationshavemoresignificantdifferences,duetotheirdifferentmod-
els for baryonic and feedback physics. Illustris predicts significantly
more power than TNG or Eagle. This occurs due to stellar feedback
differences, particularly the higher galactic wind velocities of TNG
versus Illustris. The resulting outflows impact the gas densities and
velocitiesaroundgalaxies.Atthesamescales,theTNG100andEagle
21cm power spectra are similar.
‚Ä¢Onintermediatespatialscales, ùëò‚âà0.8 Mpc‚àí1,wefindthatkey
aspects of the sources of ionizing radiation impart features. Eagle
predictsahigher21cmpowerspectrum,drivenbymorepowerinthe
ùë•HIfield.Comparedtotheothersimulations,Eaglegalaxiesinhaloes
of‚âà109M‚äôproduce a larger fraction ( ‚âà50% atùëß=7) of the total
ionizing radiation, influencing the topology of reionization. This is
partlyduetothestellarfeedbackinEagle,whichhasoverallstronger
impactsthaninTNGinthemostmassivehaloes,leadingtolowerstar
formation and older, redder stellar populations. These 21cm power
spectrumfeaturesaresimilartothoseimprintedbydifferentchoices
of the escape fraction.‚Ä¢As a result, future measurements of the 21cm signal, in addi-
tion to other reionization observables, could constrain the details of
feedback and the astrophysics of galaxy formation, at small scales
(‚â•10 Mpc‚àí1). At larger scales (‚âà0.8 Mpc‚àí1), the signature of feed-
back is degenerate with the escape fraction. For a given cosmology,
data therefore jointly constrains the source model, feedback, and
other galactic astrophysics at these scales.
Ourfindingssuggestthatcurrentstate-of-the-artcosmologicalhy-
drodynamicalsimulationsofgalaxies,coupledwithpost-processing
modeling, are viable and compelling tools to study the 21cm signal
at large scales during the epoch of reionization. In fact, the impact
of stellar feedback on the ages and metallicities, and thus ionizing
emissivities,ofstellarpopulationsisoftenomittedinthemodelingof
the21cmsignal,whichinstead,foragivenpredicted21cmsignal,we
findtobelargelydegeneratewiththeionizingescapefractionmodel.
Our findings therefore highlight the need for properly accounting
for these effects in order to e.g. constrain the ionizing escape frac-
tion from the current observed limits on 21cm power. On the other
hand, future studies with fully coupled radiative transfer, as well as
higher resolution hydrodynamical simulations with resolved inter-
stellar medium and supernova feedback physics, will enable more
quantitative predictions for the astrophysics within the 21cm signal.

APPENDIX A: MODEL VARIANTS AND CONVERGENCE
A1 Source model variants
We assess the changes in ùõøùëá2
bŒî2
21due to differences in the three
galaxyformationmodels.Bycomparing ùõøùëá2
bŒî2
21ineachsimulation
with several models for the unresolved escape fraction, we can eval-
uatetheirrelativeimportance.Tothisend,weconsiderthreetypical
models for the ionizing escape fractions of galaxies:
‚Ä¢Our simplest model considers that a constant fraction of 20 %
of all ionizing photons produced are able to escape from galaxies.
We refer to this model as the ‚Äòconstant model‚Äô or ùëì20%esc.
‚Ä¢Nextwealsoinvestigateamodelwherethephotonescapefrac-
tion evolves as a power-law function of redshift. We call this model
‚Äòevolving‚Äô or ùëìesc(ùëß). This is inspired by many papers that connect
lowmeasurementsof ùëìescatlowredshiftandtherequirementofhigh
effectiveùëìescat high redshift (e.g. in Dayal et al. 2020; Puchwein
etal.2019).Inourimplementation ùëìesc(ùëß)evolveslinearlyfrom0.4
atùëß‚â•10, to 0.1 at 5‚â§ùëß.‚Ä¢Finally we also consider a model in which sources associated
with the central galaxy of detected dark matter haloes are the only
contributors of photons towards reionization. We assume that the
photon escape fraction for these galaxies decreases with increasing
host halo dark matter mass as reported by some recent simulations
(see,forinstance,Lewisetal.2020;Rosdahletal.2022).Ourmodel
setsùëìescfor central galaxies in haloes of ùëÄh‚â§5√ó109ùëÄ‚äôto 0.3.
Beyond this threshold, ùëìescdecreases with increasing halo mass ac-
cording to a power law of exponent ‚àí0.5. This is the ‚Äòhalo ùëìesc‚Äô
model orùëìesc(ùëÄh).
In each of these cases, we calibrated the different ùëìescmodels so
as to yield a similar (within ‚âà50%) cumulative total emission of
ionizing photons from ùëß=15tillùëß=5.5in TNG100. We then test
these configurations by running them with CIFOG on TNG100 to
ensurethattheirreionizationredshiftissimilar.Finally,weapplythe
calibrated models to all the studied simulations.
Figure A1 shows the ratio of Œî2
21for the different considered ùëìesc
modelsinTNG,TNG100-NR,Illustris,andEaglewithrespecttothe
fiducial choice ( ùëì20%esc). Overall, the choice of source model affects
thefinal21cmpowerspectrumbyroughly40%orless,withthemost
dramatic changes occurring at larges scales. The amplitude of these
variationsissimilartothelargescaledifferencesweobservebetween
simulations in Sec. 2.3.
For the halo mass model (or ùëìesc(ùëÄh); dotted lines), we find
moderatetolargedifferencesnear ùëò‚â§1 Mpc‚àí1,witheitheraslight
re-normalisation or a gentle decrease towards smaller scales. This
is reminiscent of the results from the ‚ÄúTNG populations‚Äù (Fig. 8),
and‚ÄúIllustrissources‚Äù(Fig.6).Indeed,byintroducingtherighthalo
mass dependence to the escape of ionizing photons, we can mimic
the source field of a different simulation that has a different stellar
mass to halo mass relation.
For the evolving model (or ùëìesc(ùëß); dashed lines), and for ùë•HI>
0.30, we find little difference at ùëò=1 Mpc‚àí1, with all simulations
showingdifferencesatlargerandsmallerscales.Whereaswhen ùë•HI=
0.30, the evolving model is close to the constant model in TNG
and Illustris (barring some re-normalisation). The scale dependent
changes seen in the evolving model with respect to the constant
model may seem surprising, as at fixed redshift, we do not alter the
escapingluminositiesamongstgalaxies,butapplyacommonescape
fraction to all sources. However, the driving sources of reioinzation
evolveovertime.Thus,byintroducingatimeevolutionin ùëìescwecan
favour the time integrated contribution of specific halo populations,
affectingthesizesanddistributionsofionizedregions.By ùë•HI=0.30,
theseinheriteddifferenceswashout,explainingtheshiftwithrespect
to the constant model.

Figure A3. Comparison between 21cm brightness temperature, density, and ionization power spectra from the TNG100 simulation. In each panel, power is
computed at redshifts where the average ionized fraction is similar. using three different underlying Eulerian grids of a different resolutions. The results are
given in fractions of the 10243results.
MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì21 (2023)Galaxy formation models and the 21cm signal 21
results,thatdonotincludeanyvelocityeffects(redshiftspacedistor-
tion along the LoS), are very similar to each other, but substantially
different to the fiducial model that does account for these effects.
Accounting for velocity effects incurs up to a 20% reduction in

the temperature of the CMB), and this may only occur at very small
scales which are smoothed over in our predictions.

Forallaverage ùë•HI,thetwohighestresolutionresultsagreetowithin
