MARILENA CRUPI, ANTONINO FICARRA
Abstract. A very well–covered graph is an unmixed graph without isolated ver-
tices such that the height of its edge ideal is half of the number of ve rtices. We
study these graphs by means of Betti splittings and mapping cone c onstructions.
We show that the cover ideals of Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graphs are
splittable. As a consequence, we compute explicitly the minimal grade d free res-
olution of the cover ideals of such a class of graphs and prove that t hese graphs
have homological linear quotients. Finally, we conjecture the same is true for each
power of the cover ideal of a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered gr aph, and settle
it in the bipartite case.
Introduction
Since the foundations of Algebraic Graph Theory , one of the fundamental problem
has been to classify all Cohen–Macaulay graphs [34]. Let S=K[x1,...,xn] be the
standard graded polynomial ring with coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld K. It is well–known
that ifGis a simple undirected graph with |V(G)|=n, one can associate to Gtwo
squarefree monomialidealsof S, theedge idealI(G)generatedbyallmonomials xixj
such thatxixj∈E(G), and the cover ideal J(G) which is generated by monomials/producttext
xi∈Cxi, for all minimal vertex covers CofG. Aminimal vertex cover ofGis a
subsetCofV(G) such that each edge has at least one vertex in Cand no proper
subset ofChas the same property. Gis called a Cohen–Macaulay graph ifS/I(G)
is a Cohen–Macaulay ring. To classify all Cohen–Macaulay graphs is an hopeless
task.
However, thedualproblem, namelytheproblemofclassifyingallCoh en–Macaulay
cover ideals of a graph, is completely solved. Indeed the cover ideal J(G) of a
graphGis theAlexander dual of the edge ideal of G,i.e.,J(G) =I(G)∨, and the
fundamental Eagon–Reiner Criterion says thatI(G)∨is Cohen–Macaulay if and
only ifI(G) has a linear resolution [6]. All graphs Gsuch thatI(G) has a linear
resolution have been characterized by Ralph Fr¨ oberg in [13]. Furth ermore, Herzog,
Hibi and Zheng showed that for any graph Gsuch thatI(G) has a linear resolution,
thenI(G) haslinear powers ,i.e., for allk≥1,I(G)khas a linear resolution [18].
Far beyond these classical problems, a new exciting trend has been initiated by
Herzog, Moradi, Rahimbeigi andZhuin[19] withtheintroductionofth ehomological
shift ideals (see, also, [1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 20]). Firstly, given a vector a= (a1,...,an)∈
Zn
≥0, the monomial xa1
1···xannwill be denoted by xa. LetI⊂Sbe a monomial ideal

1and letFbe its minimal multigraded free S–resolution. Then, the ith freeS–module
inFisFi=/circleplustextβi(I)
k=1S(−aik) with each aikan integer vector in Znwith non–negative
entries. The monomial ideal generated by the monomials xaik(k= 1,...,βi(I)),
denoted by HS i(I), is said the ith homological shift ideal ofI. Note that HS 0(I) =I.
A basic goal of this theory is to ﬁnd those combinatorial and homolog ical properties
satisﬁed by all HS i(I),i= 0,...,pd(I). In such a case, we will speak about a
homological shift property ofI, or if the context is clear, we will simply speak of
homological property . In [19], it is conjectured that for any graph Gwhose edge
idealI(G) has a linear resolution or linear quotients, then HS i(I(G)) satisfy the
same property for all i,i.e.,I(G) hashomological linear resolution orhomological
linear quotients . The conjecture holds true for i= 1 [19, Theorem 4.7].
Inspired by the problems above, in this article we consider the dual p roblem
of Herzog et allin [19]. We want to classify the graphs Gfor whichI(G)∨has
ahomological linear resolution and those with homological linear quotients . Of
course, ﬁrst one needs to know all graphs Gsuch thatI(G)∨has a linear resolution.
One can observe that for I(G)∨to have a linear resolution, it is necessary that it
isequigenerated , which is equivalent to requiring that Gisunmixed in the sense
that all the minimal vertex covers of Ghave the same cardinality. On the other
hand, ifGis unmixed and without isolated vertices, then 2height( I(G))≥ |V(G)|
[14]. Therefore, to study the question above it is natural to restr ict ourself to the
“best possible class” of graphs: all unmixed graphs Gwithout isolated vertices and
such that 2height(I(G)) =|V(G)|. In such a case, Gis called a very well–covered
graph. Such a class of graphs has been studied by many authors (see, fo r instance,
[5, 8, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]).
The outline of this article is as follows. Section 1 contains a quick review on
Betti splittings, homological shift ideals, and some notions from the graph theory.
In particular, the classiﬁcation of all Cohen–Macaulay very well–cov ered graphs
obtained by Crupi, Rinaldo and Terai in [5] is fundamental for the de velopment of
the article.
In Section 2, we investigate Betti splittings of the cover ideals of Co hen–Macaulay
verywell–covered graphs(Proposition2.3). TheBettisplitting tec hnique introduced
in [12] by Francisco, Ha and Van Tuyl is a very useful tool througho ut the article.
In Section 3, if Gis a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph, we use the Betti
splitting, discussed in Section 2, to construct explicitly a minimal free resolution
ofI(G)∨. A minimal free resolution of I(G)∨has also been constructed in [25] by
diﬀerent tools. The main advantage of the Betti splitting technique is that one does
not need to verify if the deﬁned complex is exact or minimal, but only to determine
the suitable comparison maps [12, Proposition 2.1]. The features of our resolution
are required in Section 4 to achieve our main goal. In the last part of S ection 3,
we draw some consequences of Theorem 3.5. Firstly, we get a formu la for the Betti
numbers of I(G)∨which is independent on the characteristic of the base ﬁeld K
(Corollary 3.6). Then, some formulas for the projective dimension o f the cover ideal
of a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph Gare determined. In particular, in
Corollary 3.7, we recover a result due to Mahmoudi et all[29, Lemma 3.4] and,
2furthermore, we provide a new proof of it by Betti splitting (Remar k 3.8). Finally,
we show that I(G)∨has thealternating sum property [35, Deﬁnition 4.1] and also
we determine a formula for the multiplicity of S/I(G)∨(Proposition 3.10).
Section 4 contains our main result which states that the cover ideal of a Cohen–
Macaulay very well–covered graph has homological linear quotients ( Theorem 4.1).
Then, we infer that a very well–covered graph Gis Cohen–Macaulay if and only if
I(G)∨has homological linear resolution which is equivalent to I(G)∨having homo-
logical linear quotients (Theorem 4.2). An interesting consequence about the cover
ideal of the whisker graph G∗of a graphGis drawn in Corollary 4.3.
Our experiments and the results obtained have lead us to conjectu re that given a
Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph G, all the powers of I(G)∨have homolog-
ical linear quotients (Conjecture 4.4). At present we are able to pr ove our conjecture
only for the subclass of Cohen–Macaulay bipartite graphs. For this goal, we care-
fully study the powers of the Hibi ideals . In 1987, Hibi introduced a fundamental
class of ideals associated to a ﬁnite poset [22]. More precisely, let ( P,/{ollowsequal) be a ﬁnite
poset, aposet ideal IofPis a subset of Psuch that for any α∈ Iand anyβ∈P
withβ/precedesequalα, thenβ∈ I. IfJ(P) is the set of all poset ideals of P, ordered by in-
clusion, then J(P) is a distributive lattice. Indeed, Birkhoﬀ’s fundamental theorem
[33, Theorem 3.4.1] shows that any distributive lattice arises in such a way. To any
I ∈ J(P) one can associate the squarefree monomial uI= (/producttext
p∈Ixp)(/producttext
p∈P\Iyp)
in the polynomial ring K[{xp,yp}p∈P]. Then the Hibi ideal HPassociated to ( P,/{ollowsequal)
is the squarefree monomial ideal generated by all uI,I ∈ J(P). The importance
of such a class lies in the fact that the class of Hibi ideals coincides with the class
of the cover ideals of Cohen–Macaulay bipartite graphs [17] (see, also, [16, Lemma
9.1.9 and Theorem 9.1.13]). Therefore, one can focus on the homolog ical shifts of
powers of Hibi ideals. In Construction 4.6, we associate to any pose t (P,/{ollowsequal) and any
integerℓ≥1 a new poset ( P(ℓ),/{ollowsequalℓ) and then we show that the ℓth power of HPis
equal toHP(ℓ)up topolarization (Theorem 4.9).
Finally, observing that polarization commutes with homological shifts (Lemma
1.8) and preserves also the linear quotients property (Lemma 4.10) , we state that
all the powers of an Hibi ideal have homological linear quotients (Cor ollary 4.11).
All the examples in the article have been veriﬁed using Macaulay2 [15] and the
packageHomologicalShiftIdeals [10].
1.Preliminaries
In this section for the reader’s convenience we collect some notions and results we
need for the development of the article.
1.1.A glimpse to mapping cones and Betti splittings. LetS=K[x1,...,xn]
be a polynomial ring with coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld K. IfIis a monomial ideal of S, it
is customary to ask how one can determine its minimal free resolution .
In order to avoid any ambiguity in what follows, we assume that the tr ivial ideals
(0) andSare monomial ideals since (0) = ( ∅) andS= (1).
LetG(I) be the unique minimal generating set of I. In [12], the authors pointed
out that to compute a minimal graded free resolution of I, one can “split” the ideal
3Iinto “smaller” ideals P,Q,i.e.,I=P+QwithG(I) disjoint union of G(P) and
G(Q). Hence, to get the minimal free resolution of I, one can use the minimal free
resolutions of PandQtogether with that of P∩Q. Indeed, let us consider the
short exact sequence
0→P∩Qψ−1− −− →P⊕Qϕ− − →I=P+Q→0, (1)
whereψ−1(w) = (w,−w)andϕ((w,z)) =w+z. LetAbetheminimalfreeresolution
ofP∩Qand letBbe the minimal free resolution of P⊕Q. Note that Bis the direct
sum of the minimal free resolutions of PandQ. Since all S–modulesAiare free,
thus projective, there exists a complex homomorphism ψ:A→Bliftingthe map
ψ−1, that means a sequence of maps ψi:Ai→Bi(i≥0), called the comparison
maps, making the following diagram

commutative. It is well known that ψgives rise to an acyclic complex C(ψ) whose
0thhomologymoduleis H0(C(ψ)) = coker(ψ−1) = (P⊕Q)/Im(ψ−1)∼=(P⊕Q)/(P∩
Q)∼=P+Q=I,i.e.,C(ψ) is a free resolution of I(see, for instance, [7, Appendix
A3.12]).
The complex C(ψ) is deﬁned as follows:
(i) letC0=B0, andCi=Ai−1⊕Bi, fori>0;
(ii) letd0=ϕ◦dB

HereA[−1] is the complex Ahomologically shifted by−1.
Unfortunately, the free resolution C(ψ) is not always minimal. Below, we describe
a special situation in which this happens.
For our purpose, we need to quote the next notions from [12].
Deﬁnition 1.1. LetI,P,Qbe monomial ideals of Ssuch thatG(I) is the disjoint
union ofG(P) andG(Q). We say that I=P+Qis aBetti splitting if
βi,j(I) =βi,j(P)+βi,j(Q)+βi−1,j(P∩Q),for alli,j. (3)
Deﬁnition 1.2. LetIbe a monomial ideal of S. LetPbe the ideal generated by
all elements of G(P) divisible by xiand letQbe the ideal generated by all other
4elements of G(I). We callI=P+Qanxi–partition ofI.
IfI=P+Qis also a Betti splitting, we call I=P+Qanxi–splitting .
The following two results will be needed later.
Proposition 1.3. ([12, Corollary 2.7]). LetI=P+Qbe axi–partition of IandP
be the ideal generated by all elements of G(I)divisible by xi. If the minimal graded
free resolution of Pis linear, then I=P+Qis a Betti splitting.
Proposition 1.4. ([3, Proposition 3.1]). Letdbe a positive integer, Ia monomial
ideal with a d–linear resolution, P,Q/\e}atio\slash= 0monomial ideals such that I=P+Q,
G(I) =G(P)∪G(Q)andG(P)∩G(Q) =∅. Then the following facts are equivalent:
(i)I=P+Qis a Betti splitting of I;
(ii)PandQhaved–linear resolutions.
If this is the case, then P∩Qhas a(d+1)–linear resolution.
We close the subsection with the next result which shows that under standing
when a monomial ideal has a Betti spitting is equivalent to understan ding when the
mapping cone (i)–(ii) gives a minimal free resolution.
Theorem 1.5. ([12, Proposition 2.1]). LetI,P,Qbe monomial ideals of Ssuch
thatI=P+QandG(I)is the disjoint union of G(P)andG(Q). Furthermore,
consider the short exact sequence (1).
Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(a)I=P+Qis a Betti splitting.
(b)For alliandj, the map
TorS
i(K,P∩Q)j→TorS
i(K,P)j⊕TorS
i(K,Q)j
in the long exact sequence in Torinduced from (1)is the zero map.
(c)Applying the mapping cone to (1)gives a minimal free resolution of I.
1.2.A glimpse to linear quotients, linear powers and homologica l shift
ideals.LetIbe a monomial ideal of S=K[x1,...,xn],Ihaslinear quotients if
for some order u1>···> umof its minimal generating set G(I), all colon ideals
(u1,...,uℓ−1) :uℓ,ℓ= 2,...,m, are generated by a subset of the set of variables
{x1,...,xn}. In such a case u1> u2>···> umis called an admissible order of
I. By [16, Proposition 1.2.2] each colon ideal ( u1,...,uℓ−1) :uℓis generated by the
monomials
uj
gcd(uj,uℓ)=lcm(uj,uℓ)
uℓ, j= 1,...,ℓ−1.
By [16, Lemma 8.2.3], u1>···>umis an admissible order of Iif and only if for all
j <ℓthere exist an integer k<ℓand an integer psuch that
lcm(uk,uℓ)
uℓ=xpandxpdivideslcm(uj,uℓ)
uℓ.
One knows that if Iis generated in the same degree and it has linear quotients,
thenIhas a linear resolution. This fact is extremely useful in combinatorial com-
mutative algebra. Indeed, if one proves that an equigenerated mo nomial ideal Iand
5all its powers Ik(k≥2) have linear quotients, then it will follow that Ihaslinear
powers,i.e.,Iand all its powers have linear resolutions.
For a monomial u=xa1
1xa2
2···xann∈S, the integral vector a= (a1,a2,...,an)
is called the multidegree ofu. We also write u=xa, in particular, for a=0=
(0,0,...,0),x0= 1; whereas deg( u) =a1+a2+···+anis thedegreeofu. It is
often customary to identify the multidegree awith the monomial xa.
We quote the next deﬁnition from [19].
Deﬁnition 1.6. LetI⊂Sbe a monomial ideal with minimal multigraded free
resolution
F: 0→Fp→Fp−1→ ··· →F0→I→0,
whereFi=/circleplustextβi(I)
j=1S(−ai,j). The vectors ai,j∈Zn,i≥0,j= 1,...,βi(I), are called
theithmultigraded shifts ofI. The monomial ideal
HSi(I) = (xai,j:j= 1,...,βi(I))
is called the ithhomological shift ideal ofI.
Note that HS 0(I) =Iand HSi(I) = (0) fori<0 ori>pd(I).
The main purpose of the theory of homological shift ideals is to under stand what
homologicalandcombinatorialpropertiesareenjoyedbyallHS i(I),i= 0,...,pd(I).
We call any such property a homological shift property ofI, or if the context is clear,
simplyhomological property . Two important homological shift properties are the
following ones: Ihas ahomological linear resolution if HSi(I) has a linear resolution
for alli;Ihashomological linear quotients if HSi(I) has linear quotients for all i.
Theorem 1.5(b) implies immediately
Proposition 1.7. LetI=P+Qbe a Betti splitting of I⊂S. Then
HSk(I) = HSk−1(P∩Q)+HSk(P)+HSk(Q),
for allk≥0.
Let us recall the technique of polarization which is an operation that transforms
a monomial ideal into a squarefree monomial ideal in a larger polynomia l ring.
Letu=xb1
1xb2
2···xbnn∈Sbe a monomial. Then, the polarization ofuis the
monomial
u℘=n/productdisplay
i=1bi/productdisplay
j=1xi,j=/productdisplay
i=1,...,n
bi>0xi,1xi,2···xi,bi
in the polynomial ring K[xi,j:i= 1,...,n,j = 1,...,bi].
For a monomial u=xb1
1xb2
2···xbnnofS, we deﬁne the xi–degreeofuto be the
integer degxi(u) =bi= max{j≥0 :xj
idividesu}. LetIbe a monomial ideal of S
and setai= max{degxi(u) :u∈G(I)},i= 1,...,n. Let
R=K[xi,j:i= 1,...,n,j = 1,...,ai]
be the polynomial ring in the variables xi,j,i= 1,...,n,j = 1,...,ai. Thepolar-
izationof the monomial ideal Iis deﬁned to be the squarefree monomial ideal I℘of
Rwith minimal generating set G(I℘) ={u℘:u∈G(I)}.
6The polarization commutes with the homological shift ideals as next re sult illus-
trates.
Lemma 1.8. ([32, Corollary 1.8], [19, Proposition 1.14]). LetI⊂Sbe a monomial
ideal. Then HSi(I℘) = HSi(I)℘for alli≥0.
1.3.A glimpse to very well–covered graphs. Inthis article, a graphwill always
mean a ﬁnite undirected graph without loops or multiple edges. Let Gbe a graph
withvertex setV(G) ={x1,...,xn}and with edge setE(G). Letxi∈V(G) be a
vertex ofG. The (open) neighborhood ofxiis the set
N(xi) ={xj∈V(G) :xixj∈E(G)},
whereas the closed neighborhood ofxiis the set deﬁned as follows
N[xi] ={xj∈V(G) :xixj∈E(G)}∪{xi}.
IfW⊆V(G), we denote by G\Wthe subgraph of Gwith the vertices of Wand
their incident edges deleted.
A subsetWofV(G) is called a vertex cover if every edge of Gis incident with at
least one vertex in W. A vertex cover Wis called a minimal vertex cover if there is
no proper subset of Wwhich is a vertex cover of G. The set of all minimal vertex
cover ofGis denote by C(G).
Attached to G[34] there are the following squarefree monomial ideals of the
polynomial ring S=K[x1,...,xn]:
I(G) = (xixj:xixj∈E(G))
called the edge ideal ofG, and
I(G)∨= (xi1···xis:W={xi1,...,xis}is a minimal vertex cover of G)
called the cover ideal ofG.
A graphGisunmixed orwell–covered if all the minimal vertex covers have the
same cardinality. In particular, all the associated primes of I(G) have the same
height. A graph Gis calledCohen–Macaulay over the ﬁeld KifS/I(G) is a Cohen–
Macaulay ring. It is clear that a Cohen–Macaulay graph is unmixed [34, Proposition
7.2.9].
Finally, we recall that a pairing oﬀ of all the vertices of a graph Gis called a per-
fect matching . ThusGhas a perfect matching if and only if Ghas an even number
of vertices and there is a set of independent edges covering all the vertices, where
for a set of independent edges we mean a set of pairwise disjoint edg es [34].
The next fundamental criterion due to Eagon and Reiner will be cruc ial.
Criterion 1.9. ([6], [16, Theorem 8.1.9]). LetI⊂Sbe a squarefree monomial
ideal. Then Iis Cohen–Macaulay if and only if its Alexander dual I∨has a linear
resolution.
Now, we analyze the class of very well–covered graphs (see, for instance, [26] and
the references therein). Let Gbe an unmixed graph without isolated vertices and let
7I(G) be its edge ideal in S. In [14, Corollary 3.4], the authors proved the following
inequality:
2height(I(G))≥ |V(G)|.
Deﬁnition 1.10. A graphGis called very well–covered if it is unmixed without
isolated vertices and with 2height( I(G)) =|V(G)|.
By [8, Theorem 1.2], very well–covered graphs have always perfect m atchings.
Hence, for a very well–covered graph Gwith 2nvertices, we may assume
(∗)V(G) =X∪Y,X∩Y=∅, withX={x1,...,xn}a minimal vertex cover of G
andY={y1,...,yn}a maximal independent set of Gsuch that {x1y1,...,xnyn} ⊆
E(G).
It is important to point out that when we assume the condition ( ∗) for a very
well–covered graph, we do not force any restriction on the graph. Indeed, it is only
a relabeling of the vertices.
For the reminder of this article, set S=K[x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn] for a ﬁeld K.
For a positive integer n, we denote the set {1,2,...,n}by [n].
Theorem 1.11. ([5, Theorem 3.6]). LetGbe a graph with 2nvertices, which are
not isolated, with height(I(G)) =n. We assume condition (∗)and also we assume
that ifxiyj∈E(G)theni≤j. Then, the following conditions are equivalent:
(a)Gis a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph.
(b)The following conditions hold:
(i)ifxiyj∈E(G)thenxixj/∈E(G),
(ii)ifzixj,yjxk∈E(G)thenzixk∈E(G)for any distinct i,j,kandzi∈
{xi,yi}.
For our convenience, we reformulate Theorem 1.11, as follows.
Characterization 1.12. ([5], [29, Lemma 3.1]). LetGbe a very well–covered graph
with2nvertices. Then, the following conditions are equivalent.
(a)Gis Cohen–Macaulay.
(b)There exists a relabeling of V(G) ={x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn}such that
(i)X={x1,...,xn}is a minimal vertex cover of GandY={y1,...,yn}
is a maximal independent set of G,
(ii)xiyi∈E(G)for alli∈[n],
(iii)ifxiyj∈E(G)theni≤j,
(iv)ifxiyj∈E(G)thenxixj/∈E(G),
(v)ifzixj,yjxk∈E(G)thenzixk∈E(G)for any distinct i,j,kandzi∈
{xi,yi}.
The next example illustrates the previous characterization.

2.Betti splittings of cover ideals of very well–covered graph s
In this section we analyze the Betti splittings of the cover ideals of t he class of
Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graphs.
Our ﬁrst result shows that if we remove some pairs of vertices of a C ohen–
Macaulayverywell–covered graphinasuitableway, thenweobtain“s mallergraphs”
which are again Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graphs.
Proposition 2.1. LetGbe a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph with 2n
vertices and assume the condition (∗). ThenG\{xi,yi:i∈A}is a Cohen–Macaulay
very well–covered graph, for any subset A⊆[n].
Proof.Firstly, note that since Gis a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph with
2nvertices and condition ( ∗) holds, then height( I(G)) =n. Moreover, from [5,
Lemma 3.5], we may assume that if xiyj∈E(G) theni≤j.
IfA=∅, there is nothing to prove. Now, let A/\e}atio\slash=∅and setA={i1,i2,...,it}.
We show that
G0=G\{xi,yi:i∈A}=G\{xi1,yi1,xi2,yi2,...,xit,yit}
9is a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph. Note that G0has 2(n−t) vertices
that are not isolated. Moreover, G0satisﬁes condition ( ∗) forX0=X\{xi1,...,xit}
andY0=Y\{yi1,...,yit}, andI(G0) has height n−t, sinceX0is a minimal vertex
cover ofG0. It is clear that G0satisﬁes the conditions (i)–(ii) of Theorem 1.11(b),
becauseGsatisﬁes such conditions. By Theorem 1.11, we get that G0is also a
Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph. /square
LetF⊆[n] be a non empty set, we set xF=/producttext
i∈Fxi,yF=/producttext
i∈Fyi. Otherwise,
we setx∅=y∅= 1. For a monomial u∈S=K[x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn], we deﬁne
supportofuthe set
supp(u) ={xi:xidividesu}∪{yj:yjdividesu}.
Fromnow, when we tell about a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered g raphGwith
2nvertices, we tacitly assume that there exists a relabeling of the set of vertices
V(G) ={x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn}which satisfy the conditions (i)–(v) of Characteriza-
tion 1.12.
Lemma 2.2. LetGbe a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph with 2nvertices.
For eachu∈G(I(G)∨)there exists a unique subset Fof[n]such thatu=xFy[n]\F.
Proof.Letu∈G(I(G)∨). By deﬁnition, uis a squarefree monomial whose support
C= supp(u) is a minimal vertex cover of G. SinceGis very well–covered, uhas
degree|V(G)|/2 =n. By Characterization 1.12(b)(ii), xnyn∈E(G). Hencezn∈C
withzn∈ {yn,xn}. Note that C1=C\{zn}is a vertex cover of G1=G\{yn,xn}.
By Proposition 2.1, G1is again Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered. Since |C1|=
|C|−1 =|V(G)|/2−1 =|V(G1)|/2, we have that C1is a minimal vertex cover of
G1. Thus the monomial u1whose support is C1is a minimal generator of I(G1)∨.
By induction, u1=xF1y[n−1]\F1for a unique subset F1of [n−1]. Ifzn=xn, let
F=F1∪{n}. Otherwise, if zn=yn, letF=F1. Inbothcases, u=znu1=xFy[n]\F,
as required. /square
Note that if Gis a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph with 2 nvertices,
then
N[xn] ={xi1,xi2,...,xit,xn,yn},withir<n,r∈[t],
and
N[yn] ={xj1,xj2,...,xjp,xn,yn},withjq<n,q∈[p].
Moreover, from Characterization 1.12, ir/\e}atio\slash=jq, for allr∈[t] andq∈[p]. We will
consider again such sets in the next section (see, Setup 3.1 and Lem ma 3.2).
Proposition 2.3. LetGbe a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph with 2n
vertices. Let N[xn] ={xi1,xi2,...,xit,xn,yn},N[yn] ={xj1,xj2,...,xjp,xn,yn}
and deﬁne
G1=G\{xi1,yi1,xi2,yi2,...,xit,yit,xn,yn},
G2=G\{xj1,yj1,xj2,yj2,...,xjp,yjp,xn,yn}.
10Then
I(G)∨=xi1xi2···xit·ynI(G1)∨+xj1xj2···xjp·xnI(G2)∨
is a Betti splitting.
Proof.LetJ1=xi1xi2···xit·ynI(G1)∨andJ2=xj1xj2···xjt·xnI(G2)∨. Note that
yndoes not divide any minimal monomial generator of J2. ThusG(J1)∩G(J2) =∅.
We claim that J1andJ2haven–linear resolutions. Indeed, by Proposition 2.1, G1
andG2are again Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graphs and our claim fo llows
from Criterion 1.9. By virtue of Proposition 1.3, to prove that I(G)∨=J1+J2is a
Betti splitting, it is enough to show that I(G)∨=J1+J2is ayn–partition of I(G)∨.
Indeed, let ube a minimal generator of I(G)∨. ThenC= supp(u) is a minimal
vertex cover of G. By Lemma 2.2, u=xFy[n]\Ffor someF⊆[n]. Thus, either
yn∈Corxn∈C. We distinguish two cases.
Case 1. Supposeyn∈C. Sincexn/∈C, butxi1xn,...,xitxn∈E(G) andC
is a vertex cover, then we obtain that xi1,...,xit∈C. Hencexi1xi2···xit·yn
dividesu. Note that the support of v=u/(xi1xi2···xit·yn) is a vertex cover of G1.
Furthermore, supp( v) is a minimal vertex cover, since |supp(v)|=n−(t+ 1) =
|V(G1)|/2 andG1is a very well–covered graph (Proposition 2.1). Hence v∈I(G1)∨
andu∈J1in such a case.
Case 2. Supposexn∈C. Sinceyn/∈C, butxj1yn,...,xjpyn∈E(G) andCis a
vertex cover, then we obtain that xj1,...,xjp∈C. Hencexj1xj2···xjp·xndivides
u. Note that the support of w=u/(xj1xj2···xjp·xn) is a vertex cover of G2.
Furthermore, supp( w) is a minimal vertex cover, since |supp(w)|=n−(p+ 1) =
|V(G2)|/2andG2isaverywell–covered graph(Proposition2.1). Hence, w∈I(G2)∨
andu∈J2.
Hence, we have shown that G(I(G)∨) is contained in G(J1)∪G(J2).
For the opposite inclusion, let v∈G(I(G1)∨), then supp( v) is a minimal vertex
cover ofG1. We claim that C= supp(xi1···xit·ynv) is a minimal vertex cover of
G. Indeed, all edges of Gincident with a vertex belonging to {xi1,...,xit,yn}are
incident with a vertex of C. SinceN[xn]\{xn,yn}={xi1,...,xit} ⊂C, then each
edge which is incident with xnis also incident with a vertex of C. Finally, let ebe
an edge incident with yikfor somek∈[t]. Thene=xjyik∈E(G). Sincexjyik
andxikxnare both edges of G, by Characterization 1.12(v), xjxn∈E(G), too. It
follows that xj∈N[xn]\ {xn,yn}and{xj,yik} ∩C/\e}atio\slash=∅. Finally,Cis a minimal
vertex cover of G. This shows that G(J1)⊆G(I(G)∨). Similarly, one proves that
G(J2)⊆G(I(G)∨) by exploiting again condition (v) of Characterization 1.12. The
result follows. /square

3.The resolution of cover ideals of very well–covered graphs
In this section we construct the minimal free resolution of the cove r idealI(G)∨
of any Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph G. Our method uses induction on
halfofthenumber ofvertices of GandthemappingconedescribedinSubsection 1.1.
Indeed, the mapping cone applied to the Betti splitting of I(G)∨(Proposition 2.3)
12yields a minimal free resolution of I(G)∨, if we know the minimal free resolutions
of the cover ideals of three suitable subgraphs which we can associa te to the given
graphG.
Firstly, let G1andG2be two graphs, we deﬁne intersection graph ofG1adG2
the graphGwithV(G) =V(G1)∩V(G2) andE(G) ={e:e∈E(G1)∩E(G2)}.
We denote GbyG1∩G2.
Setup 3.1. LetGbe a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph with 2 nvertices.
LetN[xn] ={xi1,xi2,...,xit,xn,yn},N[yn] ={xj1,xj2,...,xjp,xn,yn}and deﬁne
G1=G\{xi1,yi1,xi2,yi2,...,xit,yit,xn,yn},
G2=G\{xj1,yj1,xj2,yj2,...,xjp,yjp,xn,yn}.
By Proposition 2.3, both G1andG2are Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graphs.
Furthermore, |V(G1)|= 2(n−1−t) and|V(G2)|= 2(n−1−p).
SetJ=I(G)∨,J1=xi1xi2···xit·ynI(G1)∨andJ2=xj1xj2···xjp·xnI(G2)∨. Then,
Proposition 2.3 implies that J=J1+J2is a Betti splitting of J.
Finally, let us consider the subgraph G3=G1∩G2ofG. Since the structure of G1
andG2, it is clear that G3is Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered, too.
For instance, in Example 2.4, G3=G\{xi,yi:i/\e}atio\slash= 5}.
The following lemmas will be crucial in the sequel.
Lemma 3.2. Assume Setup 3.1. Then
N[xn]∩N[yn] ={xn,yn}.
Proof.For alls∈[p],xjsyn∈E(G). Thus Characterization 1.12(iv) implies that
xjsxn/∈E(G), and soxjs/∈N[xn], for alls∈[p]. FinallyN[xn]∩N[yn] ={xn,yn}.
/square
Lemma 3.3. Assume Setup 3.1. Then
J1∩J2=xi1xi2···xit·xj1xj2···xjp·xnynI(G3)∨.
Proof.SetJ1,2=J1∩J2. SinceJ=J1+J2is a Betti splitting and Jhas an
n–linear resolution, then J1,2has an (n+1)–linear resolution (Proposition 1.4). A
generating set for J1,2is the set {lcm(u1,u2) :u1∈G(J1),u2∈G(J2)}. SinceJ1,2is
equigenerated in degree n+1, then
G(J1,2) =/braceleftbig
lcm(u1,u2) :u1∈G(J1), u2∈G(J2),deg(lcm(u1,u2)) =n+1/bracerightbig
.
By Lemma 3.2, N[xn]∩N[yn] ={xn,yn}. Thus, by the presentation of J1andJ2,
we get that each monomial w∈G(J1,2) is divided by xi1···xit·xj1···xjp·xnyn.
Note that ( X∪Y)\{xi1,yi1,...,xit,yit,xj1,yj1,...,xjp,yjp,xn,yn}is the vertex set
of the graph G3. Moreover the support of v1=u1/(xi1xi2···xit·xj1xj2···xjp·yn) is
a minimal vertex cover of the very well–covered graph G3. Since lcm( u1,u2) =xnu1,
we get that lcm( u1,u2) =xi1···xit·xj1···xjp·xnynv1∈G(xi1···xit·xj1···xjp·
xnynI(G3)∨).
Conversely, let w=xi1···xit·xj1···xjp·xnynv∈G(xi1···xit·xj1···xjp·xnynI(G3)∨),
13withv∈I(G3)∨. Then supp( xj1xj2···xjp·v) is a minimal vertex cover of G1and
supp(xi1xi2···xit·v) is a minimal vertex cover of G2. Thusu1=w/xn∈G(J1)
andu2=w/yn∈G(J2). Sincew= lcm(u1,u2) and deg(w) =n+1, we have that
w∈G(J1,2), showing the other inclusion. /square
We now turn to the construction of the minimal free resolution. For a subsetC
of the set of variables X∪Y={x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn}, we set
zC=xCxyCy, (4)
withCx={i:xi∈C}andCy={j:yj∈C}.
IfGis graph such that V(G) ={x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn}andC∈ C(G), we deﬁne
the setC(G;C) ={xs:ys∈Cand (C\ys)∪xs∈ C(G)}. Recall that C(G) is the
set of all minimal vertex cover of G.
For instance, in Example 1.13, for C={x1,x2,y3,y4},C(G;C) ={x3}. Indeed,
{x1,x2,y4} ∪x3={x1,x2,x3,y4}is a minimal vertex cover of the given graph G.
One can observe that x4/∈ C(G;C), since{x1,x2,y3}∪x4is not a vertex cover of
G. Moreover, for C={x1,x2,x3,x4},C(G;C) =∅.
In what follows, we denote by/parenleftbigC(G;C)
i/parenrightbig
the set of all subsets of size iofC(G;C),
0≤i≤ |C(G;C)|. With abuse of notation, for σ∈/parenleftbigC(G;C)
i/parenrightbig
, we setxσ=/producttext
xs∈σxs.
In particular, x∅= 1.
Construction 3.4. Assume Setup 3.1. Let
F:··· →Fidi− − →Fi−1di−1− −− → ···d2− − →F1d1− − →F0d0− − →J→0
be the complex

greezCxσ, whereC∈ C(G) andσ∈/parenleftbigC(G;C)

,i.e.,σ⊆ C(G;C) is a subset
of sizei;

i>0 is deﬁned as follows:
di(f(C;σ)) =/summationdisplay
xs∈σ(−1)α(σ;xs)/bracketleftbig
ysf((C\ys)∪xs;σ\xs)−xsf(C;σ\xs)/bracketrightbig
,
whereα(σ;xs) =|{xj∈σ:j >s}|.
Fromnow on, we set J1,2=J1∩J2and denote by ( FJ1,2,dJ1,2), (FJ1,dJ1), (FJ2,dJ2)
the minimal free resolutions of J1,2,J1,J2, respectively.
Theorem 3.5. The complex Fgiven in Construction 3.4 is the minimal free reso-
lution ofJ=I(G)∨.
Proof.We proceed by strong induction on |V(G)|/2 =n. Forn= 1,I(G) = (x1y1)
andJ=I(G)∨= (x1,y1). In this case one readily veriﬁes that the complex Fof
Construction 3.4 is the minimal free resolution of J=I(G)∨. So, letn >1. The
graphsG1,G2,G3have vertex sets whose cardinality is less than |V(G)|, thus by in-
duction we can assume that the minimal free resolutions of I(G1)∨,I(G2)∨,I(G3)∨
14are as given in Construction 3.4. As a consequence, we know explicitly the res-
olutions FJ1,2,FJ1,FJ2, since each of these resolutions is equal to one of the three
previously mentioned resolutions up to multiplication by a suitable mono mial.
Let (FJ,dJ) be the resolution obtained by the mapping cone applied to the Betti
splittingJ=J1+J2. ThenFJis the minimal free resolution of J. We show that
FJcan be identiﬁed with F. We achieve this goal in three steps.
Step 1. Let us show that the free modules of FJhave the basis described in
Construction 3.4. Bythemapping cone(Subsection 1.1, (i)), FJ
i=FJ1,2
i−1⊕FJ1

i.
The bases of FJ1
i,FJ2
iandFJ1,2
iare the following ones, respectively:
B1=/braceleftBig
xi1xi2···xit·yn·fJ1(C1;σ1) :C1∈ C(G1), σ1∈/parenleftbiggC(G1;C1)
i/parenrightbigg/bracerightBig
,
B2=/braceleftBig
xj1xj2···xjp·xn·fJ2(C2;σ2) :C2∈ C(G2), σ2∈/parenleftbiggC(G2;C2)

i/parenrightbigg/bracerightBig
.
Letf(C;σ) be a basis element of Fias in Construction 3.4, i.e., with multidegree
zCxσand withC∈ C(G),σ∈/parenleftbigC(G;C)
i/parenrightbig
. We distinguish three possible cases.
Case 1.1. Letxn∈C. ThenN[yn]\N[xn] ={xj1,...,xjp} ⊂C. Indeed,Cis
a vertex cover of G,yn/∈C(Lemma 2.2) but xjryn∈E(G) forr∈[p]. Hence,
C2=C\ {xj1,...,xjp,xn}is a minimal vertex cover of G2. Furthermore, for all
xs∈σ, (C2\ys)∪xsis a minimal vertex cover of G2because (C\ys)∪xsis a
minimal vertex cover of G. Sinceb=xj1xj2···xjp·xn·fJ2(C2;σ)∈ B2has the same
multidegree of f(C;σ), we can identify f(C;σ) withb.
Case 1.2. Letyn∈Candxn/∈σ. ThenC1=C\ {x1,...,xit,yn}is a minimal
vertex cover of G1. As before, we can identify f(C;σ) withxi1...xit·yn·fJ1(C1;σ)∈
B1.
Case 1.3. Letyn∈Candxn∈σ. Thenboth Cand(C\yn)∪xnareminimal vertex
covers ofG. Hence, (N[xn]∪N[yn])\ {xn,yn}={xi1,...,xit,xj1,...,xjp} ⊂C.
SettingC3=C\{xi1,...,xit,xj1,...,xjp,yn}andσ3=σ\xn, we obtain that C3
and (C3\ys)∪xsare both minimal vertex covers of G3for allxs∈σ3. Hence, in
this case we can identify f(C;σ) withxi1···xit·xj1···xjp·xnyn·fJ1,2(C3;σ3)∈ B3.
Conversely, any basis element b∈ Bi(i= 1,2,3) can be identiﬁed with a basis
elementf(C;σ), as given in Construction 3.4. Thus, we realize that the modules FJ
i
have the required bases as described in Construction 3.4.
Step 2. Letψ−1:u∈J1,2/mapsto→(u,−u)∈J1⊕J2. In order to apply the mapping

One can note that ψiis well deﬁned. Indeed, C1∈ C(G1),C2∈ C(G2),σ3⊆
C(G1;C1), andσ3⊆ C(G2;C2).

In particular, the graded Betti numbers of I(G)∨do not depend upon the character-
istic of the underlying ﬁeld K.
LetGbe a graph and let zizj,zkzℓ∈E(G) be a pair of edges. We say that zizj
andzkzℓare3–disjoint if the induced subgraph of Gon the vertex set {zi,zj,zk,zℓ}
consists of two disjoint edges. The maximum size of a set of pairwise 3 –disjoint
edges inGis denoted by a(G) [29].
The next result holds.

a(G) = reg(S/I(G)) = max/braceleftbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingleC(G;C)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle:C∈ C(G)/bracerightbig
= pd(I(G)∨).
Proof.From [16, Proposition 8.1.10], pd( I(G)∨) = reg(S/I(G)). Thus the assertion
follows from [29, Lemma 3.4] and Corollary 3.6. /square
Remark 3.8. The equality a(G) = reg(S/I(G)) has been ﬁrstly proved in [29,
Lemma 3.4]. Here we give a new proof by Betti splittings. By [24, Lemma 2.2],
one always have reg( S/I(G))≥a(G). It remains to prove that pd( I(G)∨)≤a(G).
Assume Setup 3.1.
By [12, Corollary 2.2] applied to the Betti splitting provided in Proposit ion 2.3,
and by Lemma 3.3, we have
pd(I(G)∨) = max/braceleftbig
pd(I(G1)∨),pd(I(G2)∨),pd(I(G3)∨)+1/bracerightbig
.
By induction on n=|V(G)|/2, we may assume that pd( I(Gi)∨)≤a(Gi) fori=
1,2,3. Note that a(Gi)≤a(G), fori= 1,2,3, clearly. Thus it remains to prove the
inequalitya(G3)+1≤a(G). LetDbe a set of pairwise 3–disjoint edges of G3with
|D|=a(G3). ThenD∪xnynis again a set of pairwise 3–disjoint edges of G. Indeed,
ife=zkzℓ∈D, then{zk,zℓ} ⊆V(G3) =V(G)\ {xi,yi:xi∈N[xn]∪N[yn]}.
Thus there can not be any edge connecting zkorzℓwith either xnoryn. This shows
that the induced subgraph with vertex set {zk,zℓ,xn,yn}has only two edges. Hence
a(G)≥ |D|+1 =a(G3)+1.

true.
On the other hand, by a formula of Peskine andSzpiro [31] (see also [ 16, Corollary

204.Homological shifts of vertex cover ideals of very well–cover ed
graphs and applications to Hibi ideals
In this section, we investigate the homological shift ideals of powers of the vertex
cover ideal of Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graphs. Here is o ur main result.
In what follows we refer to the notation in Setup 3.1.
Theorem 4.1. LetGbe a Cohen–Macaulayverywell–coveredgraphwith 2nvertices.
ThenHSk(I(G)∨)has linear quotients with respect to the lexicographic orde r>lex
induced by xn>yn>xn−1>yn−1>···>x1>y1, for allk≥0.
Proof.We proceed by strong induction on n=|V(G)|/2≥1. Forn= 1,I(G) =
(x1y1) andJ=I(G)∨= (x1,y1). Hence, HS 0(J) =J, HS1(J) = (x1y1) have linear
quotients with respect to >lex.
Letn>1. By Proposition 2.3,
I(G)∨=xj1xj2···xjp·xnI(G2)∨+xi1xi2···xit·ynI(G1)∨(6)
is a Betti splitting.
Setf=xj1···xjp·xnandg=xi1···xit·yn. Since HS k(wI) =w·HSk(I) for all
monomial ideals IinSand all non zero monomials w∈S, from (6), Proposition
1.7 and Lemma 3.3, we have that
HSk(I(G)∨) =fg·HSk−1(I(G3)∨)+f·HSk(I(G2)∨)+g·HSk(I(G1)∨).
Note that, since |V(Gj)|<|V(G)|(j= 1,2,3), by the inductive hypothesis,
HSk(I(Gj)∨) have linear quotients with respect to >lex.
Let
G(HSk−1(I(G3)∨)) =/braceleftbig
w1>lexw2>lex···>lexwq/bracerightbig
, (7)
G(HSk(I(G2)∨)) =/braceleftbig
v1>lexv2>lex···>lexvr/bracerightbig
, (8)
G(HSk(I(G1)∨)) =/braceleftbig
u1>lexu2>lex···>lexus/bracerightbig
, (9)
thusG(HSk(I(G)∨)) is ordered as follows:
fgw1>lex···>lexfgwq>lexfv1>lex···>lexfvr>lexgu1>lex···>lexgus.
We prove that such an order is an admissible order of HS k(I(G)∨). For our
purpose, we need to show that all the following three colon ideals
(fgw1,...,fgw ℓ−1) :fgwℓ, ℓ∈ {2,...,q}, (10)
/parenleftbig
fgHSk−1(I(G3)∨),fv1,...,fvℓ−1/parenrightbig
:fvℓ, ℓ∈ {1,...,r}, (11)
/parenleftbig
fgHSk−1(I(G3)∨),fHSk(I(G2)∨),gu1,...,guℓ−1/parenrightbig
:guℓ, ℓ∈ {1,...,s},(12)
are generated by variables.
First Colon Ideal. Let us consider the colon ideal in (10). Since,
(fgw1,...,fgw ℓ−1) :fgwℓ= (w1,...,wℓ−1) :wℓ,
the assertion follows from the fact that HS k−1(I(G3)∨) has linear quotients with
respect to the order in (7).
21Second Colon Ideal. Let us consider the colon ideal in (11).
SetP=/parenleftbig
fgHSk−1(I(G3)∨),fv1,...,fvℓ−1/parenrightbig
:fvℓ. One can observe that
P= (fgHSk−1(I(G3)∨)) :fvℓ+(v1,...,vℓ−1) :vℓ,
with (v1,...,vℓ−1) :vℓgenerated by variables. Indeed, HS k(I(G2)∨) has linear quo-
tients with respect to the order in (8).
Thus, if we show that each generator of ( fgHSk−1(I(G3)∨)) :fvℓis divided by a
variable of P, we conclude that Pis generated by variables, as wanted. The colon
ideal (fgHSk−1(I(G3)∨)) :fvℓis generated by the monomials
lcm(fgwj,fvℓ)
fvℓ, j= 1,...,q.
Fixj∈ {1,...,q}. By Construction 3.4, we have that
fgwj=wxσ, w∈G(I(G)∨), yn∈supp(w), σ⊆ C(G;supp(w)), xn∈σ,|σ|=k,
fvℓ=vxτ, v∈G(I(G)∨), xn∈supp(v), τ⊆ C(G;supp(v)), xn/∈τ,|τ|=k.
Leth= lcm(wxσ,vxτ)/(vxτ). If deg(h) = 1,his a variable and there is nothing to
prove. Suppose deg( h)>1. Let us consider the following integer
i= min/braceleftBig
i:zidividesh=lcm(wxσ,vxτ)
vxτ, zi∈ {xi,yi}/bracerightBig
.(13)
Since deg(h)>1 andyndividesh, we have that i<n. From Lemma 2.2, we have
thatyidivides at least one of the monomials wxσ,vxτ. Indeed, if yidoes not divide
any of these monomials, then xiwill divide both these monomials, and consequen-
tially,zi∈ {xi,yi}does not divide h. Against our assumption.
Now, letN[yi] ={xk1,...,xkb,xi,yi}. We claim that xk1···xkbdivides both mono-
mialsw,v. Indeed,xidivides at least one of the monomials w,v. For instance,
sayxidivideswxσ, then either xidividesworxi(w/yi)∈G(I(G)∨). In both cases,
xk1···xkbmust divide w, sinceworxi(w/yi) are minimal vertex covers. The same
reasoning works if xidividesvxτ. Thusxk1···xkbmust divide worv. Without loss
of generality, suppose that xk1···xkbdividesw. Then, by Construction 3.4, none of
the variables yk1,...,ykbdividesw. By Characterization 1.12(iii), k1<···<kb<i.
Thus, by the meaning of i,zd∈ {xd,yd}does not divide hfor alld=k1,...,kb.
Hence, we see that xk1···xkbdivides both the monomials w,v. Now, we distinguish
two cases.
Case 1. Supposexiyidivides one between the monomials wxσandvxτ, and that
yidivides the other one. Suppose, for instance, that xiyidivideswxσand thatyi
dividesvxτ. Then,xi(v/yi)xτ>lexvxτ. Moreover, xi(v/yi)∈G(I(G)∨), because
xk1···xkbdividesvand so supp( xi(v/yi)) is again a minimal vertex cover of G.
We claim that xi(v/yi)xτ∈HSk(I(G)∨). Indeed for all c∈τ,N[yc]\ {xc,yc} ⊆
supp(v). SinceN[yc]\{xc,yc}is a subset of X={x1,...,xn}and supp(xi(v/yi)) =
(supp(v)\yi)∪xi, we see that N[yc]\{xc,yc}is again a subset of supp( xi(v/yi)).
22Thus, for all c∈τ,xcxi(v/yi)/yc∈G(I(G)∨),i.e.,τ⊆ C(G;supp(xi(v/yi))). Fi-
nally,xi(v/yi)xτ∈HSk(I(G)∨). Moreover,
lcm(xi(v/yi)xτ,vxτ)
vxτ=xiandxidividesh.
It follows that his divided by the variable xibelonging to P, as desired.
Otherwise, suppose xiyidividesvxτandyidivideswxσ. Then,xi(w/yi)xσ>lexwxσ
and, as before, xi(w/yi)xσ∈G(HSk(I(G)∨)). Moreover,
h′=lcm(xi(w/yi)xσ,vxτ)
vxτ=h/xidividesh
and soh′∈Pand deg(h′)<deg(h). Hence, we can iterate the previous reasoning
by considering the integer i′arising from h′, as in formula (13). In such a situation
it isi′>i.
Case 2. Supposexidivides one of the monomials wxσ,vxτandyidivides the
other one. Suppose xidivideswxσandyidividesvxτ. Thenxi(v/yi)xτ>lexvxτ,
and arguing as before, one gets xi(v/yi)xτ∈HSk(I(G)∨). Moreover,
lcm(xi(v/yi)xτ,vxτ)
vxτ=xiandxidividesh.
Therefore,his divided by the variable xibelonging to P, as desired.
Otherwise, suppose xidividesvxτandyidivideswxσ. It follows that xi(w/yi)xσ∈
G(HSk(I(G)∨)) andxi(w/yi)xσ>lexwxσ. Moreover,
h′=lcm(xi(w/yi)xσ,vxτ)
vxτ=h/xidividesh.
Thush′∈Pand deg(h′)<deg(h). In such a case, we iterate the reasoning made
above by considering the integer i′arising from h′as in (13), and this time i′>i. It
is clear that iterating the reasoning above we get that Pis generated by variables.
Third Colon Ideal. SetP=/parenleftbig
fgHSk−1(I(G3)∨),fHSk(I(G2)∨),gu1,...,guℓ−1/parenrightbig
:
guℓ. One can observe that Pis generated by the monomials
lcm(fgwi,guℓ)
guℓ,lcm(fvj,guℓ)
guℓ,lcm(guh,guℓ)
guℓ,
withi∈[q],j∈[r] andh∈[ℓ−1]. To prove that Pis generated by variables it is
enough to show that any of the monomials above is divided by a variable zb∈P.
Note that HS k(I(G1)∨) has linear quotients with respect to the order in (9), thus
the colon ideal ( gu1,...,guℓ−1) :guℓ= (u1,...,uℓ−1) :uℓis generated by variables.
Thus, lcm(guh,guℓ)/(guℓ)∈(u1,...,uℓ−1) :uℓis divided by a variable of P. For
the other two type of monomial generators it suﬃces to repeat th e same argument
as in the Second Colon Ideal case. /square
As an immediate consequence we have the following classiﬁcation.
Theorem 4.2. LetGbe a very well–covered graph with 2nvertices. Then, the
following conditions are equivalent:
23(i)Gis Cohen–Macaulay.
(ii)I(G)∨has homological linear quotients.
(iii)I(G)∨has homological linear resolution.
LetGbe a ﬁnite simple graph with vertex set V(G) =X={x1,...,xn}.
Thewhisker graph G∗ofGis the graph with vertex set V(G∗) ={x1,...,xn} ∪
{y1,...,yn}and edge set E(G∗) =E(G)∪{xiyi:i= 1,...,n}. In other words, the
whisker graph of Gis obtained by adding to each vertex xiawhisker, that means
that for each vertex xi∈V(G) we add a new vertex yiand an edge xiyiconnecting
these two vertices.
Corollary 4.3. LetGbe any simple graph with nvertices. Then the vertex cover
ideal of the whisker graph G∗ofGhas homological linear quotients.
Proof.It is easy to see that G∗satisﬁes the conditions (i)–(v) of Characterization
1.12. Thus G∗is a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph and the result follows
from the previous theorem. /square
Our experiments and the results above, suggest the following conj ecture.
Conjecture 4.4. LetGbe a Cohen–Macaulay very well–covered graph with 2n
vertices. Then HS k((I(G)∨)ℓ) has linear quotients with respect to the lexicographic
order induced by xn> yn> xn−1> yn−1>···> x1> y1, for allk≥0, and all
ℓ≥1.
Note that our conjecture would also imply that I(G)∨has linear powers.
At present it seems too diﬃcult to prove our conjecture in full gene rality. There-
fore we concentrate our attention on the subclass of Cohen–Mac aulaybipartite
graphs.
For this purpose, we need to recall what an Hibi ideal is [22].
Let (P,/{ollowsequal) be a ﬁnite partially ordered set (a poset, for short) and set P=
{p1,...,pn}. Aposet ideal ofPisasubset IofPsuchthatif pi∈P,pj∈ Iandpi/precedesequal
pj, thenpi∈ I[17]. To any poset ideal IofP, we associate the squarefree monomial
uI= (/producttext
pi∈Ixi)(/producttext
pi∈P\Iyi) in the polynomial ring S=K[x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn].
Then the Hibi ideal (associated to P) is the monomial ideal of Sdeﬁned as follows:
HP=/parenleftbig
uI:Iis a poset ideal of P/parenrightbig
.
As an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.1 we have the next result .
Corollary 4.5. Let(P,/{ollowsequal)be a ﬁnite poset. Then HPhas homological linear quo-
tients.
Proof.By [16, Lemma 9.1.11], the Alexander dual H∨
Pmay be seen as the edge ideal
of a Cohen–Macaulay bipartite graph GP. In particular GPis a Cohen–Macaulay
very well–covered graph. Hence, seeing HPas the cover ideal of GP, the result
follows immediately from Theorem 4.1. /square
Now, we turn to the powers of an Hibi ideal. We denote by J(P) the distributive
lattice consisting of all poset ideals of ( P,/{ollowsequal) ordered by inclusion.
24Fromnowon, withabuse oflanguagebut withtheaimofsimplifying then otation,
we identify each pi∈Pwith the variable xi,i∈[n].
Construction 4.6. Let (P,/{ollowsequal) be a ﬁnite poset. For any integer ℓ≥1, we construct
a new poset ( P(ℓ),/{ollowsequalℓ) deﬁned as follows:
-P(ℓ) =/braceleftbig
xi,1,xi,2,...,xi,ℓ:i= 1,...,n/bracerightbig
,
- andxi,r/{ollowsequalℓxj,sif and only if xi/{ollowsequalxjandr≥s.
By [22, pag 99] we have the following useful property.
Lemma 4.7. Let(P,/{ollowsequal)be a ﬁnite poset. Each minimal monomial generator of Hℓ
P
posses a unique expression of the form
uI1uI2···uIℓ,withI1⊆ I2⊆ ··· ⊆ I ℓ,Ii∈ J(P), i= 1,...,ℓ.
Now, we needthetechnique ofpolarizationdiscussed inSubsection 1 .2. Let (P,/{ollowsequal)
be a ﬁnite poset and ℓ≥1 be a positive integer. Note that Xand∅are both poset
ideals ofP, thus both uX=x1x2···xnandu∅=y1y2···ynbelong toHP. Thus,
we have that uℓ
X=xℓ
1xℓ
2···xℓ
nanduℓ
∅=yℓ
1yℓ
2···yℓ
nbelong toHℓ
P. Therefore the
polynomial ring in which Hℓ
Plives is
R=K[xi,j,yi,j:i= 1,...,n, j = 1,...,ℓ].
In order to preserve the structure of Hibi ideals, we innocuously modifypolariza-
tion. More precisely, let 1 ≤k≤ℓandi∈[n], then we set
(xk
i)℘=xi,1xi,2···xi,ℓ,
(yk
i)℘=yi,ℓyi,ℓ−1···yi,ℓ+1−k,
and extend the polarization of an arbitrary monomial in the obvious w ay. In other
words, with respect to the usual polarization, we are just applying the relabeling of
the variables yi,j/mapsto→yi,ℓ+1−jfori= 1,...,nandj= 1,...,ℓ.
Example 4.8. Consider the poset ( P,/{ollowsequal) withP={x1,x2,x3},x3≻x1andx3≻
x2. The poset ( P,/{ollowsequal) and the distributive lattice J(P) are depicted below:

We have that

One can easily verify that ( H2
P)℘=HP(2)with respect to our modiﬁed polarization.
For instance, consider ( x1y2y3)(y1x2y3)∈G(H2
P). Then
/parenleftbig
(x1y2y3)(y1x2y3)/parenrightbig℘= (x1y1x2y2y2
3)℘=x1,1y1,2x2,1y2,2y3,1y3,2=uI∈G(HP(2)),
whereI={x1,1,x2,1} ∈ J(P(2)).
Theorem 4.9. Let(P,/{ollowsequal)be a ﬁnite poset. Then, for any ℓ≥1,
(Hℓ
P)℘=HP(ℓ).
Proof.By Lemma 4.7, Hℓ
Pis minimally generated by the monomials
uI1uI2···uIℓ,withI1⊆ I2⊆ ··· ⊆ I ℓ,Ij∈ J(P), j= 1,...,ℓ,
whileHP(ℓ)⊂K/bracketleftbig
xi,j,yi,j:i∈[n],j∈[ℓ]/bracketrightbig
is generated by the squarefree monomials
uI=/parenleftbig/productdisplay
xi,j∈Ixi,j/parenrightbig/parenleftbig/productdisplay
xi,j∈P(ℓ)\Iyi,j/parenrightbig
,I ∈ J(P(ℓ)).
Hence, to get the assertion, we must show that for all uI1uI2···uIℓ∈G(Hℓ
P), the
monomial ( uI1uI2···uIℓ)℘is equal to uI, for some poset ideal I ∈ J(P(ℓ)), and
26conversely, given any uI∈G(HP(ℓ)), withI ∈ J(P(ℓ)), then there exist I1⊆ I2⊆
··· ⊆ Iℓ,Ii∈ J(P),i= 1,...,ℓ, such that uI= (uI1uI2···uIℓ)℘.
LetuI1uI2···uIℓ∈G(Hℓ
P), withI1⊆ I2⊆ ··· ⊆ I ℓ. Setki=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle{r:xi∈ Ir}/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
andmi=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle{s:xi/∈ Is}/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. Therefore, ki+mi=ℓand
(uI1uI2···uIℓ)℘=/parenleftbig/productdisplay
xi∈Pki/productdisplay
r=1xi,r/parenrightbig/parenleftbig/productdisplay
xi∈Pℓ/productdisplay
s=ki+1yi,s/parenrightbig
.
We claim that I=/braceleftbig
xi,r:r= 1,...,ki/bracerightbig
is a poset ideal of P(ℓ). From this, it will
follow that ( uI1uI2···uIℓ)℘=uI∈G(HP(ℓ)), as wanted. Indeed, let xi,r∈ Iand
xj,s∈P(ℓ) such that xj,s/precedesequalℓxi,r. We must prove that xj,s∈ I. By deﬁnition of the
order/{ollowsequalℓwe havexj/precedesequalxiandr≥s. Ifj=i, then alsoxi,s∈ I, by the polarization
technique. Let j/\e}atio\slash=i. We note that kj≥ki. Indeed, for any csuch thatxi∈ Ic,
one has that xj∈ Ic, sincexj/precedesequalxi. Thus, if xi,rdivides (uI1uI2···uIℓ)℘, then
xj,rdivides (uI1uI2···uIℓ)℘. For any d≤r,xj,ddivides (uI1uI2···uIℓ)℘, by the
polarization technique. Since s≤r, thenxj,sdivides (uI1uI2···uIℓ)℘, as wanted.
Conversely, let I ∈ J(P(ℓ)) be a poset ideal and uI∈G(HP(ℓ)). Set
Ik=/braceleftbig
xi:xi,ℓ+1−k∈ I/bracerightbig
,fork= 1,...,ℓ.
We claim that the sets Ijare poset ideals of Pand that I1⊆ I2⊆ ··· ⊆ I ℓ. From
this, it will follow that uI= (uI1uI2···uIℓ)℘∈G((Hℓ
P)℘), as wanted.
Fixk∈[ℓ] and letxi∈ Ikandxj/precedesequalxi. We must prove that xj∈ Ik, too. Since
xj/precedesequalxi, thenxj,ℓ+1−k/precedesequalℓxi,ℓ+1−kby deﬁnition of the order /{ollowsequalℓ. Thusxj,ℓ+1−k∈ I
and consequently xj∈ Ik, as wanted.
Now, letk∈[ℓ] withk < ℓ. We prove that Ik⊆ Ik+1. As a consequence, it
follows that I1⊆ I2⊆ ··· ⊆ I ℓ, as desired. Let xi∈ Ik, thenxi,ℓ+1−k∈ I. Since
ℓ+1−k>ℓ+1−(k+1), we get that xi,ℓ+1−k/{ollowsequalℓxi,ℓ+1−(k+1)and soxi,ℓ+1−(k+1)∈ I,
too. Thusxi∈ Ik+1. The assertion follows. /square
The following key lemma proved by Olteanu [30, Proposition 5.3] follows by a
more general result stated by Jahan [23, Lemma 3.3].
Lemma 4.10. LetI⊂Sbe a monomial ideal. Then Ihas linear quotients with
admissible order u1> u2>···> umofG(I)if and only if I℘has linear quotients
with admissible order u℘
1>u℘
2>···>u℘
mofG(I℘).
The previous lemma obviously also holds with respect to our modiﬁed po lariza-
tion. Finally, we obtain the next result which gives a positive answer to Conjecture
4.4 for the class of bipartite graphs.
Corollary 4.11. LetGbe a Cohen–Macaulay bipartite graph with 2nvertices. Then
HSk((I(G)∨)ℓ)has linear quotients with respect to the lexicographic orde r induced by
xn>yn>xn−1>yn−1>···>x1>y1, for allk≥0and allℓ≥1.
Proof.By [16, Theorem 9.1.3], there exists a poset ( P,/{ollowsequal) such that I(G)∨=HP.
Letℓ≥1. Then by Theorem 4.9, ( Hℓ
P)℘=HP(ℓ). By Theorem 4.1, for all k≥0,
HSk(HP(ℓ)) has linear quotients with respect to the lexicographic order induce d by
xn,ℓ>yn,ℓ>xn,ℓ−1>yn,ℓ−1>···>xn,1>yn,1>xn−1,ℓ>yn−1,ℓ>···>x1,1>y1,1.
27By Lemma 1.8, HS k(HP(ℓ)) = HSk((Hℓ
P)℘) = HSk(Hℓ
P)℘. Finally, applying Lemma
4.10, we obtain that HS k(Hℓ
P) = HSk((I(G)∨)ℓ) has linear quotients with respect
to the lexicographic order induced by xn> yn> xn−1> yn−1>···> x1> y1, as
wanted. /square
