These are times of contemplation and reorientation in quantum field theory. With
the experimental detection of the Higgs boson in 2012 finally the finishing stone of
the Standard Model of elementary particle physics [1] surfaced. On the theoretical
side, theStandardModelisbasedontheconceptofrenormalizedlocalquantumfield
theory. The confidence in this concept originally and primarily relies on the extraor-
dinary success of the centerpiece of the Standard Model, quantum electrodynamics
(QED), which exhibits an impressive agreement between theory and experiment
(Cf., e.g., [2], for more comprehensive reviews see [3].). The successful application
of renormalized local quantum field theory to the other components of the Standard
Model, the electroweak theory and to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), have fur-
ther advanced this confidence. On the other hand, many practicing quantum field
theoristsareawareofthemanyshortcomingsanddeficienciesoftheconceptofrenor-
malized local quantum field theory which, by the way, has changed and developed in
a multifold way in the decades since its birth at the end of the 1940‚Äôs. To name a few
of these issues we mention here the occurrence of ultraviolet (UV) divergencies, the
cosmological constant problem, hierarchy and naturalness problems, Haag‚Äôs theo-
rem (For an instructive illustration of the views of a number of well-known quantum
field theorist see, e.g., the conference volume [4].). It should, however, be pointed
out that in the quantum field theory community there is no unified view which of
these issues constitute features and which are problematic aspects of renormalized
local quantum field theory. Correspondingly, opinions on which direction should be
chosen for the future conceptual and technical development of quantum field theory
are diverse (For a recent account of the current situation see [5].). While many
active researchers might favour new ideas which have not been discussed in the past
a certain fraction of the quantum field theory community might be willing to not
completely disregard past ideas which have largely been bypassed so far. In the
present article, it is our intention to bring together a couple of thoughts and ideas
(supplemented by the corresponding references) that have emerged in the past. We
hope that the collection of this information in a single place will be beneficial to
those readers who consider voices from the past as an inspiration for future research
rather than purely as a matter for historians of science.
Let us start with pointing out that with reference to the UV divergency prob-
lem in QED some of the very fathers of this theory have repeatedly expressed their
dissatisfaction with their own creation up to the end of their lives. So, Richard
Feynman stated 1965 in his Nobel Prize speech quite frankly : ‚Äú..., I believe there
is really no satisfactory quantum electrodynamics, but I‚Äôm not sure. ..., I think
that the renormalization theory is simply a way to sweep the difficulties of the di-
vergences of electrodynamics under the rug.‚Äù ([6], Sciencep. 707,Phys. Today pp.
43/44,Prix Nobel p. 189,Nobel Lectures p. 176,Selected Papers p. 30). Now one
might think that Feynman has later, after the development of the Wilsonian view
on renormalization in the early 1970‚Äôs and the emergence of the effective field theory
2concept changed his view. However, this seems not to be the case and one can read
in Feynman‚Äôs popular science book ‚Äú QED ‚Äì The Strange Theory of Light and Mat-
ter‚Äù the passage ( ùëõandùëóare the bare counter parts of the physical electron mass ùëö
and electron charge ùëí, respectively.): ‚ÄúThe shell game that we play to find ùëõandùëóis
technically called ‚Äúrenormalization.‚Äù But no matter how clever the word, it is what
I would call a dippy process! Having to resort to such hocus-pocus has prevented
us from proving that the theory of quantum electrodynamics is mathematically self-
consistent. It‚Äôs surprising that the theory still hasn‚Äôt been proved self-consistent
one way or the other by now; I suspect that renormalization is not mathematically
legitimate. What is certain is that we do not have a good mathematical way to
describe the theory of quantum electrodynamics: such a bunch of words to describe
the connection between ùëõandùëóandùëöandùëíis not good mathematics.‚Äù ([7], 1st ed.
1985, pp. 128/129, 2nd ed. 2006, p. 127/128). In a similar way Paul Dirac stated
in a lecture in 1975 (published 1978): ‚ÄúHence most physicists are very satisfied with
the situation. They say: ‚ÄúQuantum electrodynamics is a good theory, and we do
not have to worry about it any more.‚Äù I must say that I am very dissatisfied with
the situation, because this so called ‚Äúgood theory‚Äù does involve neglecting infinities
which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not
sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it
turns out to be small ‚Äì not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do
not want it.‚Äù ([8], p. 36). Few years later, in 1980 (published in 1983), Dirac repeats
his critical view: ‚ÄúSome new relativistic equations are needed; new kinds of interac-
tions must be brought into play. When these new equations and new interactions
are thought out, the problems that are now bewildering to us will get automatically
explained, and we should no longer have to make use of such illogical processes as
infinite renormalization. This is quite nonsense physically, and I have always been
opposed to it. It is just a rule of thumb that gives results. In spite of its successes,
one should be prepared to abandon it completely and look on all the successes that
have been obtained by using the usual forms of quantum electrodynamics with the
infinities removed by artificial processes as just accidents when they give the right
answers, in the same way as the successes of the Bohr theory are considered merely
as accidents when they turn out to be correct.‚Äù ([9], p. 55). The weight one might
be tempted to assign to these views certainly will depend on the scientific taste of
each theoretician, however, at least one should take note of them.
It often happens in the course of the development of science that early consid-
erations and ideas are more fundamental than those emerging later. This is easily
explainable by the fact that at the early stages of the development of a subject
one enters largely unchartered territory and simple and structural ideas are then
needed to choose the right road to scientific progress. Sometimes conflicting ideas
are competing with each other. Initial dominance of one idea does not necessarily
mean that less successful concepts should be written off. It happens from time to
time that these disregarded concepts make a surprising return for one reason or
the other. Consequently, a look into the past (science history) may be helpful for
3shaping the future. For the following considerations, we will depart from such an
element of science history.
2 Extending early thoughts of Wolfgang Pauli
Let us start our concrete discussion with a statement made by Wolfgang Pauli in
a private letter (in German) to Victor Weisskopf (by then, assistant to Wolfgang
Pauli at the ETH Zurich) in 1935. The comment of Wolfgang Pauli concerns the
self-energy of the electron in QED, a theory which was under development in those
days. In the context of the struggle with the UV divergencies of QED Wolfgang
Pauli expresses the following conviction (English translation in brackets: K. S.):
‚Äú...(Ich glaube allerdings, da√ü in einer vern√ºnftigen Theorie die Selbstenergie nicht
nur endlich, sondern Null sein mu√ü ...[...(However, I believe that in a sensible the-
ory the self-energy has not only to be finite but zero ...]‚Äù ([10], p. 779 of: Letter
[425b] of December 14, 1935 from Pauli to Weisskopf. Part of: Nachtrag zu Band
I: 1919‚Äì1929 und II: 1930‚Äì1939, pp. 733-826). How can we understand this expec-
tation of a future correct quantum electrodynamical theory expressed by Wolfgang
Pauli? If one starts quantizing the theory (in this case, charged fermions interacting
with the electromagnetic field) on the basis of a Lagrangian with the physical (i.e.,
measured) value of the mass of the fermions inserted all physical processes that can
conceivably have an impact on that mass have effectively been taken into account
already. Consequently, the total impact of all physical processes taken into account
in the (theoretical) process of quantization (i.e., taking into account quantum fluc-
tuations) on the mass of these fermions should vanish (nonrenormalization). This
statement can be reformulated by saying that the fermion mass should not receive
any radiative corrections under quantization. One can now extend this early point of
view of Wolfgang Pauli and consider starting quantization not only with the physical
valueofthefermionmassintheinitialLagrangianbutchoosingasinitialLagrangian
(in an arbitrary theory now) the (effective) Lagrangian which describes the physi-
cal world (with all its ‚Äì infinitely many ‚Äì nonlocal and nonpolynomial terms). In
principle (in theory, not in practice, of course), this can be read off from scattering
experiments (For the connection between the scattering matrix and the effective
action see, e.g., [11], sec. 2.4, [12].). If one now starts the process of quantization
with this ‚Äútrue‚Äù Lagrangian all radiative corrections to it should vanish because any
quantum fluctuations described by this Lagrangian have already been taken into ac-
count in this Lagrangian. Consequently, the physical (effective) Lagrangian should
be invariant under the process of quantization, all radiative corrections should van-
ish. This view of the process of quantization amounts to bootstrapping the effective
action of a theory. Quantities denoted within standard local renormalizable quan-
tum field theory as bare and renormalized ones, respectively, then coincide.
Before continuing our verbal discussion, let us make the above statements more
4precise in terms of equations. We consider within a path integral framework La-
grangian quantum field theory in flat ( ùëõ-dimensional Minkowski) space-time and
a (one-component) scalar field theory to pursue the discussion (for the following
equations cf., e.g., [13], chap. 9). A generalization to more complicated theories
is straightforward. The generating functional of Green functions of the scalar field
ùúë(ùë•)is given by the equation
ùëç[ùêΩ] =ùê∂‚à´Ô∏Å
ùê∑ùúë eùëñ 0[ùúë] +ùëñ‚à´Ô∏Å
ùëëùëõùë• ùêΩ(ùë•)ùúë(ùë•), (1)
where  0[ùúë]is the so-called classical action of the theory and ùê∂some fixed normal-
ization constant. Then, the generating functional of the connected Green functions
is
ùëä[ùêΩ] =‚àíùëñlnùëç[ùêΩ] . (2)
The effective action  [ùúë], which also is the generating functional of the one-particle-
irreducible (1PI) Green functions, is obtained as the first Legendre transform of
ùëä[ùêΩ],
 [ùúë] = ùëä[ùêΩ]‚àí‚à´Ô∏Å
ùëëùëõùë• ùêΩ(ùë•)ùúë(ùë•). (3)
Here
ùúë(ùë•) =ùõøùëä[ùêΩ]
ùõøùêΩ(ùë•)(4)
which in turn leads to
ùõø [ùúë]
ùõøùúë(ùë•)=‚àíùêΩ(ùë•) (5)
in analogy to the classical field equation for  0[ùúë]. Equivalently, using the above
expressions
eùëñ [ùúë]=ùê∂‚à´Ô∏Å
ùê∑ùúë eùëñ 0[ùúë+ùúë] +ùëñ‚à´Ô∏Å
ùëëùëõùë• ùêΩ(ùë•)ùúë(ùë•)(6)
can be considered as the defining relation for the effective action, where the r.h.s.
of the above equation has to be calculated using a current ùêΩ(ùë•), given by Eq. (5),
which is a functional of ùúë. Eq. (1) defines a map, ùëî1:  0[ùúë]‚àí‚Üíùëç[ùêΩ], from the class
of functionals called classical actions to the class of functionals ùëç. Furthermore,
we have mappings, ùëî2:ùëç[ùêΩ]‚àí‚Üíùëä[ùêΩ], (Eq. (2)) and ùëî3:ùëä[ùêΩ]‚àí‚Üí  [ùúë](Eq.
(3)). These three maps together define a map ùëî3‚àòùëî2‚àòùëî1=ùëì:  0[ùúë]‚àí‚Üí [ùúë](Eq.
(6)) from the set of so-called classical actions to the set of effective actions. It is
understood that in order to properly define the map a regularization scheme for the
scalar field theory is applied. Up to renormalization effects, the classical action  0[ùúë]
determines the effective action  [ùúë]uniquely via the map ùëìwhich encodes quantum
5principles. In this standard scheme, the (quantum) effective action is built directly
from classical physics and exhibits no independence in its own right.
The terms of the difference  [ùúë] =  [ ùúë]‚àí 0[ùúë]are denoted as ‚Äôradiative correc-
tions‚Äô. The above verbal reasoning in generalization of early thoughts of Wolfgang
Pauli leads to the equation
 [ùúë] = 0 , (7)
expressing the vanishing of all radiative corrections, i.e.,
 [ùúë] =   0[ùúë]. (8)
The equation for the complete effective action which is equivalent to the fixed point
condition for the map ùëìreads ( ùê∂‚Ä≤is some normalization constant)
eùëñ [ùúë]=ùê∂‚Ä≤‚à´Ô∏Å
ùê∑ùúë eùëñ [ùúë+ùúë] +ùëñ‚à´Ô∏Å
ùëëùëõùë• ùêΩ(ùë•)ùúë(ùë•),(9)
where
ùêΩ(ùë•) =‚àíùõø [ùúë]
ùõøùúë(ùë•). (10)
The above selfconsistency equation (9) defines the (finite) effective action (including
its coupling constants and mass ratios) without any reference to classical physics ex-
clusively via quantum principles encoded in the map ùëì. The fixed points of the map
ùëìthen describe physical reality. From out this perspective, the standard formulation
of quantum field theory represented by eq. (1) can roughly be understood as the first
step of an iterative solution of the nonlinear functional integro-differential equation
(9) by applying the map ùëìto some initial (in this case ‚Äòclassical‚Äô) action  0[ùúë]. For
the first time, the above equation (9) to be taken as basis of quantum field theory
has been proposed in 1972 by L. V. Prokhorov [14]. Not being aware of the earlier
work by Prokhorov, the same proposal has been made by the present author in 1993
[15]. In a somewhat different (Hamiltonian) setting (coupled cluster methods), J. S.
Arponen has expressed similar ideas in 1990 ([16], p. 173, paragraph starting with
the words: ‚ÄúThe possible solution corresponds to a system which suffers no change
under quantization.‚Äù).
3 Further discussion
Given the mature state of standard renormalizable quantum field theory, the above
point of view (defining the effective action as a fixed point of the map ùëì) faces
myriads of objections. Some of them may be misunderstandings, others are com-
pletely justified concerns, others yet are possibly prejudices. Misunderstandings can
6be dealt with most easily ‚Äì by clarifications. For example, one might ask: Given
the crucial role of radiative corrections within the standard formulation of quantum
field theory in correctly describing physical reality (for example, in QED) how could
one ever possibly think of a theory of physical reality characterized by the vanishing
of all radiative corrections (in an interacting theory)? The difficulty here, however,
is just a terminological one. Of course, also a modified formulation of quantum field
theory needs to deliver those kind of terms in the effective action we denote as ra-
diative corrections within the established standard approach. While the analytical
expression yielded from a modified formulation of quantum field theory may differ
from those within the standard formulation, the numerical results for experimentally
accessible quantities (e.g., the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron) need to
be (almost ‚Äì within experimental limits) the same. The point is that in the modified
view of quantum field theory represented by eq. (9) those terms denoted in the stan-
dard formulation as radiative corrections are already incorporated in the action to
be quantized. But, as the action to be quantized is supposed to be invariant under
quantization (according to eq. (9)) no new terms may emerge, consequently, in the
modified formulation of quantum field theory no radiative corrections (relative to
the initial action to be quantized) occur.
Certainly, one elementary and justified concern with respect to eq. (9) consists in
the question of whether eq. (9) allows any non-trivial (i.e., non-Gaussian) solutions
(Free field theories, of course, always obey eq. (9).). In fact, it has been shown by
example in a finite-dimensional Grassmann algebra analogue of eq. (9) (i.e., within
a fermionic zero-dimensional field theory) that eq. (9) has exact non-trivial (i.e.,
non-Gaussian) solutions [17]. For an (bosonic) example from standard analysis see
[18]. Of course, as has been pointed out by Prokhorov [14] from the outset eq. (9)
represents a very complicated equation and presently very little can be said about
its eventual non-trivial solutions in general. Experience from effective action studies
in quantum field theory tells us that non-trivial solutions of eq. (9) can be expected
to be nonlocal and nonpolynomial functionals of fields. Whether these nonlocal and
nonpolynomial actions  solving eq. (9) preserve unitarity and causality can only be
decided once they are found. However, it has been shown for a wide class of nonlo-
cal and nonpolynomial (scalar) quantum field theories in the past [19, 20] that they
respect these two principles ‚Äì a fact, from which one may derive certain optimism.
It is of course conceivable that the general version of eq. (9) (written down for an
arbitrary but fixed collection of fluctuating fields) does not have any non-Gaussian
solution at all for the certain field content one has chosen. If this was the case the
existence of a non-Gaussian solution to the generalised version of eq. (9) could be
applied as a theory selection criterion perhaps in the same way as the (stationary)
Schr√∂dinger equation selects energy (eigen)values of quantum mechanical systems.
In a certain sense, at the end of the day only non-Gaussian solutions of eq. (9) are
physical ones because only they provide the interactions for the structures we ob-
serve in physical reality. Away from the rigid concept discussed above of the effective
action as a fixed point of the map ùëìnon-Gaussian solutions of eq. (9) may be con-
7sidered also interesting within the standard lore. While usually perturbation theory
is built around a Gaussian solution of eq. (9), choosing a non-Gaussian solution of
eq. (9) as starting point for perturbation theory may also be of some interest. For
a discussion in this direction see [21].
From a methodological point of view, the largest difference of the approach rep-
resented by eq. (9) to the established approach in standard quantum field theory
consists in the following. Standard local renormalizable quantum field theory starts
(among other things, e.g., choosing the space-time dimensionality) with the choice
of the field content of the theory under consideration and the functional form of the
(classical/bare) action  0(cf. eq. (1)), a quantity which, in principle, is unobservable
(due to the existence of radiative corrections). This is also true in the different ver-
sions of the Wilsonian approach to quantum field theory (inspired by the theory of
phase transitions in statistical mechanics). While in a statistical mechanical system
(e.g., a spin system modelling a certain microscopic condensed matter structure) the
structure of the Hamiltonian defined on a lattice with fixed lattice spacing can in
principle be linked to experimental data, this is not the case within quantum field
theory where the bare action is not related to observation (For a related discussion
see, e.g., [22].). Consequently, in the established standard approach to quantum
field theory the theoretical description of physical reality (i.e., the effective action
 ) is inferred from quantities not accessible to experiment in principle. In contrast,
within the approach represented by eq. (9) only the field content of the quantum
fluctuations can be chosen, the functional form of the effective action  is selfcon-
sistently restricted by its property to be a solution of this equation. Beyond free
field theories, i.e., for non-Gaussian solutions of eq. (9), this can be expected to be
highly restrictive.
