Abstract
The most frequently used indicators for the productivity an d impact of scientists are the total number of publication
(Npub), total number of citations ( Ncit) and the Hirsch (h) index. Since the seminal paper of Hirsch, in 2005, it is largely
debated whether the h index can be considered as an indicator independent of NpubandNcit. Exploiting the Paretian
form for the distribution of citations for the papers author ed by a researcher, here we discuss scaling relations betwee n
h,NpubandNcit. The analysis incorporates the Gini index as an inequality m easure of citation distributions and a
recently proposed inequality kernel, gintropy (resemblin g to the entropy kernel). We ﬁnd a new upper bound for the
h value as a function of the total number of citations, conﬁme d on massive data collected from Google Scholar. Our
analyses reveals also that the individualized Gini index ca lculated for the citations received by the publications of a n
author peaks around 0.8, a value much higher than the one char acteristic for the usual socio-economic inequalities.
Keywords: scaling, H index, data mining, Lorentz curve, scientometri cs
1. Introduction
For characterizing the scientiﬁc productivity of a researc her or institution the published research papers /books
are used as a proxy, while the impact of these works are measur ed through citations. It is known, that productivity
and impact are not entirely independent of each other, since no one can have impact without productivity. In order
to construct a simple measure for both productivity and impa ct, the Argentinian physicist Jorge Hirsch introduced a
simple scalar measure, known today as the ”Hirsch index”, or simply as the ”h index” [2]. However one may have a
single paper worth of Nobel price. Someone else may have seve ral thousand papers with weak or mediocre citation
score but nevertheless outperforms the former person with r espect to the Hirsch index. So the Hirsch index alone is
not a suﬃcient indicator of scientiﬁc performance. It is a long-stan ding question in Scientometrics, whether the three
most simple and well-known measures: the number of publicat ions ( Npub), the total number of citations ( Ncit) and the
”h-index” ( h) are connected statistically by scaling laws [3].
In a recent paper Siudem et.al. [4] build a growth model using ﬁrst principles: ”preferential attachment” and ”rich
get richer” aka Matthew e ﬀect. Their model nicely ﬁts to empirical data. They argue tha t scientiﬁc impact has three
dimensions. In particular they refer to the Hirsch index as a widely used one but insu ﬃcient to properly grab the merit
of the investigated researcher, journal or institute. The M atthew eﬀect based dynamic modeling in scientometrics goes
back to Schubert [27]. Barab´ asi applied the ”rich get riche r” principle to network evolution renaming it as preferenti al
attachment. Siudem [4] combines in its model the two, and use s as a third factor the probability of switching on and
oﬀthe Matthew eﬀect. In fact similar observations are made without any model ling (cf. [5] and references therein).
The use of the preference switch probability appears as a thi rd factor in the modelling, but is not a real ”sciento-
metric” indicator. Nevertheless the Sidum model is very con vincing and provides an excellent ﬁt to empirical data
for various ﬁelds of sciences. Siudem [4] shows, as a byprodu ct, that a single indicator, in particular the Hirsch index,
is not suﬃcient to properly grab scientiﬁc merit.
In subsequent papers ([8, 9, 12] ) further excellent reﬁneme nt of the 3-variate regression of the Hirsch index and
other scientiﬁc indicators are presented.
In what follows we provide a theoretical framework which inc orporates the Hirsch index as a third scientometrics
indicator in addition to productivity (publication) and im pact (citation) for the description of scientiﬁc merit. Mor e
Preprint submitted to Elsevier February 14, 2023speciﬁcally, we search for statistical evidences on the sca ling of the Hirsch index, using basic concepts borrowed from
inequality measures like the Gini index [14] and Gintropy [1 5], and verify our approach by using data collected from
Google Scholar.
Scientiﬁc citations and their statistics are intensively s tudied by the ﬁeld of Scientometrics [16]. The h-index
quantiﬁes the largest hnumber of publications of an author, so that each of them have at least hcitations. The work
of Hirsch [2] has nowadays above 13.000 Google Scholar citat ions, illustrating the attention it received from the
scientiﬁc community. Regarding the h-index, many criticis m were formulated and connections with other indicators
were identiﬁed, the topic generating its own subﬁeld in scie ntometrics (for a review see [17, 18]). Along with the
h-index there are many other indices used in scientometrics to characterize scientiﬁc output. One may mention here
without reaching comprehensiveness some other well-know i ndices like the ”R-index”, ”m-index”, ”i-10 index”, ”g-
index”...etc [19]. It is known today that no index is perfect , and even inside of a subﬁeld no researcher should be
boxed in according to these crude numbers [20]. Nevertheles s, scientometric measures remain an objective tool that
complements the more personalized, yet sometimes subjecti ve evaluations. In order to further simplify the use of
crude numbers as evaluation tools, it is important to unders tand whether they are independent measures or linked to
each other.
The total number of published research papers, citations, t he number of independent citations or citing papers,
h-index and even these normalized to the number of authors is not a reliable scientometric measure, if we do not limit
our investigations to a narrow subﬁeld of science. From a pur e statistical investigation it makes sense, however, to
consider a large ensemble of researchers, across a variety o f scientiﬁc ﬁelds. Such studies are concerned about the
big, coarse-grained picture of publication habits in scien ce, and make sense from a pure statistical view. It has been
speculated already that Ncitandhare statistically connected [3]. The fact that universal pa tterns for the distribution
of the number of papers and number of citations for the public ations authored by a researcher, journal or institution
were identiﬁed [21, 22], suggests that one could search for f urther statistical connections between the main sciento-
metric and productivity indicators. In the following secti ons, after a brief introduction to the measures used in our
investigations, we aim to uncover such connections analyzi ng citations from the view of inequalities.
2. Gini index, Cumulatives and Gintropy
The Gini index was introduced by Corrado Gini in order to comp ress the information on wealth-inequality in
a single measure between zero and one [14]. Its deﬁnition is s imply the average of the absolute valued di ﬀerence
between two data points - normalized by the expectation valu e of the sum. For a given Probability Density Function
(PDF),ρ(x), deﬁned for x≥0, it can be written as a ratio of integrals as follows:
G≡∝angbracketleft|x−y|∝angbracketright
∝angbracketleft|x+y|∝angbracketright=1
2∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright∞/integraldisplay
0dx∞/integraldisplay
0dy|x−y|ρ(x)ρ=1
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright∞/integraldisplay
0dx∞/integraldisplay
x(y−x)ρ(x)ρ(y). (1)
The expected values for the base variables are denoted by ang ular brackets:∝angbracketleft·∝angbracketright.
This deﬁnition has several alternate forms. Using
C(x)≡∞/integraldisplay
xρ(y)dy, (2)
and
F(x)≡1
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright∞/integraldisplay
xyρ(y)dy, (3)
one obtains
G=/integraldisplay∞
0ρ(x)/bracketleftigg
F(x)−x
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketrightC(x)/bracketrightigg
dx (4)
2Further alternative expressions for the Gini index can be ob tained by some straightforward mathematics, and reﬂect a
geometric meaning of an area:
G=/integraldisplay∞
0dxF(x)ρ(x)−/integraldisplay∞
0dxx
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketrightC(x)ρ(x)=/integraldisplay1
0FdC−/integraldisplay1
0CdF. (5)
The Gini index can also be expressed via the cumulative popul ation in a form which is low end high end symmetric:
G=1
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright∞/integraldisplay
0C(x)/parenleftig
1−C(x)/parenrightig

Note that for scaling PDF-s, ρ(x)=1
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketrightf/parenleftigx
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright/parenrightig
,C,FandGdo not depend directly on ∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright. The curve on the F−C
map, constructed from the PDF, ρ(x), is the Lorenz curve [23], illustrated in Figure 1.
Gintropy [15, 24] was constructed in order to emphasize entr opy-like properties when constructing the Gini index
in wealth and income distribution studies. It is based on the Lorentz curve geometry describing a certain area in the
data plane spanned by the cumulative population and cumulat ive wealth axes. It is deﬁned as
σ=F−C, (7)
and geometrically illustrated in Figure 1. From the Lorentz curve geometry we get:
/integraldisplay1
0σdC=/integraldisplay1
0σdF=1

We recall here the general entropy-like properties of gintr opy.
1. The gintropy is never negative:
σ=F−C=C−F≥0. This is obvious from inspecting the integral σ=∞/integraltext

ρ(y)dy=x/integraltext

2.σ(x) is maximal at x=∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright. Investigating dσ(x)/dx=/parenleftbig1−x/∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright/parenrightbigρ(x),ρ≥0, it is immediate to locate the
point whereσ(x) has a maximal value.
3.σ(x) is a concave curve. Taking into account thatdσ

∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright−1, we get :
d2σ
dC2=1
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketrightdx
dC=−1
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketrightρ(x)<0. (9)
4. For many practically important PDF’s the σ(C) formula looks like entropy terms based on ρ(x) [15].
3. Hirsch index scaling
3.1. General considerations
The Hirsch index (or simply the ”h” index) [2], promoted to us e for evaluation of scientiﬁc popularity of individu-
als, journals and institutions, is deﬁned as that number of p ublications for which at least the same amount of citations
has been collected:
h=N(x≥h)=NpubC(h). (10)
3Figure 1: The cumulative number of citations, F, plotted against the the cumulative publication fraction o f those cited at least xtimes, C, - known
also as the Lorentz curve. This plot also reveals visually th e Gintropyσand the Gini index G:σis the distance between the Lorentz curve and the
diagonal, G/2 is the area between these lines.
For a given PDF,ρ(x), the Hirsch index his the solution of the above equation, which in most of the com mon cases is
transcendental.
Some distributions are special. Whenever they reﬂect some u nderlying scaling property, we expect that the Hirsch
index is also subject to some consequential scaling. The que stion is in what construction can one make such a scaling
apparent. In this paper we aim at constructing a scaling betw een the Hirsch index, h, the total number of publications,
Npub, and citations to those publications, Ncit. Note that∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright=Ncit/Npub.
In risk analysis the typical cumulative function has a form
C(x)=e−H(x). (11)
In such cases the PDF, ρ(x)=−dC/dx, becomes
ρ(x)=H′(x) e−H(x). (12)
Here H(x) is called the cumulative risk, while its derivative, H′(x) the risk rate [29].
Quite often the PDF-s used to ﬁt statistical data have two com mon parameters, reﬂecting a shift and a magniﬁcation
of the independent variable. These two parameters can be con nected to the mean value and to the variation. As a
formula one uses (or guesses) a universal function taken at a linear form of the argument. Assuming
H(x)=f(ax+b) (13)
with a parameterless function, normalization criteria are automatically fulﬁlled for the PDF. The parameters aandb
can be related to the expectation value, ∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright, and the remaining problem will contain only one single para meter. One
can always choose f(x) in a way that a>0.
Using eq.(13), and its inverse,
x≡f−1(H)−b
a, (14)
one determines the following universal value
κ(b)≡a∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright+b=/integraldisplay∞
f(b)f−1(H)e−HdH. (15)
4The cumulative risk, and with that all other functions relat ed to the PDF, are parameterized in terms of bonly, and are
functions of x/∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright. Therefore such a scaling property is quite general.
H(x)=f/parenleftigg
[κ(b)−b]x
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright+b/parenrightigg
. (16)
In conclusion, a very important subclass of PDF-s shows the s caling
ρ(x)=1
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketrightp/parenleftiggx
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright/parenrightigg
. (17)
In these cases the cumulative integrals CandF, and therefore the gintropy, σ≡F−C, depend only on the ratio to
the expected value, x/∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright, and the parameter b. Therefore
Cb(h)=cb/parenleftiggh
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright/parenrightigg
. (18)
Knowing that∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright=Ncit/Npub, the Hirsch index is a solution of the general expression usi ng the cumulative
fraction:
h
Npub=e−f[κ(b)−b]h
NpubN2
pub
Ncit+b, (19)
since
h
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright=h
NpubN2
pub
Ncit. (20)
From here it follows that there is a scaling between Ncit,Npubandh, based on the universal function, f, the parameter
band its special integral summarized in κ(b):
√Ncit
Npub=/radicaligg
[κ(b)−b]h/Npub
f−1[−ln(h/Npub)]−b. (21)
Further scaling relations for the h-index can be obtained in various ways. They are not independent from the above
result. We derive that h/∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketrightsatisﬁes a consistency relation
h
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright=N2
pub
Ncitcb/parenleftiggh
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright/parenrightigg
(22)
For a ﬁxed bvalue the solution for this ratio depends on the single param eter1
λ=N2
pub
Ncit. (23)
We note thatλ∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright=Npub, due to∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright=Ncit/Npubbeing the average number of citations for the investigated d istribution.
Comparing now the two forms of the relations for the Hirsch in dex, equations (19) and (22)
h
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright=λcb/parenleftiggh
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright/parenrightigg
,h
Npub=cb/parenleftigg
λh
Npub/parenrightigg
, (24)
one realizes that both h/∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketrightandh/Npubare functions of the single parameter combination, λ.
Multiplying the above two scaling laws, yields the already k nown forms:
h2
Ncit=λcb/parenleftiggh
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright/parenrightigg2
=h
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketrightcb/parenleftiggh
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright/parenrightigg
. (25)
The result is that for a constant parameter bthe ratio, h2/Ncitdepends only on the ratio h/∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright, just like the gintropy
does. Since the gintropy has a maximal value, one can derive f rom that an inequality for the h2/Ncitratio, too.
According to [3], for most data sets/radicalbig
Ncit≈2h (26)
1eq.(21) displays the quantity 1 /√
λas a function of Npub.
53.2. Scaling for the Pareto distribution
The scaling Tsallis-Pareto distribution [25] is a special c ase of the distributions satisfying the form implied in (16) .
The validity of this for the distribution of citations of ind ividuals was proven in [22]. The probability density functi on
writes as:
ρ(x)=a b(1+ax)−b−1(27)
The tail-cumulative integrals in the Pareto case are given b y:
C(x)=(1+ax)−b(28)
F(x)=(1+a b x)
a(1+a x)−b(29)
while the gintropy is
σ(x)=ab x(1+ax)−b. (30)
The Gini index can be also computed for the Tsallis-Pareto di stribution. A simple mathematics leads us to
GT P=b
2b−1, (31)
which is seemingly a general rule for the PDF’s characterizi ng the distribution of citations.
For the Tsallis-Pareto distribution, the (25) scaling rela tion write as:
h2
Ncit=h
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketrightcb/parenleftiggh
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright/parenrightigg
=h
∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketrightCb(h) (32)
Noting that 1/∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright=a(b−1), and taking into account (29) and (30) we get
h2
Ncit=b−1
bσ(h). (33)
Now, it has been shown in [15] that the gintropy has a maximum, therefore
h2
Ncit≤(1−1/b) max(σ). (34)
What remains is to obtain the maximum value of gintropy for th e scaling Tsallis-Pareto distribution. Taking into
account that the gintropy reaches its maximum for x=∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright, this leads to:
max(σ)=σ(∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright)=b
b−1/parenleftigg
1+1
b−1/parenrightigg−b
. (35)
Using equation (34) we conclude that:
h2
Ncit≤/parenleftigg
1+1
b−1/parenrightigg−b
. (36)
From the deﬁnition of the h index the scaling between Ncit,Npubandh:
h
Npub=C(h)=/parenleftigg
1+h N pub
(b−1)Ncit/parenrightigg−b
(37)
This leads the special form of the scaling suggested in equat ion (21) as being
√Ncit
Npub=/radicaltp/radicalbth/Npub
(b−1)/bracketleftig
(h/Npub)−1/b−1/bracketrightig (38)
64. Test on google scholar data
According to our former study [22], citation distributions are similar to the distribution of Facebook shares and
scales according to a common Tsallis-Pareto distribution, with b=1.4. We have argued that the reason for this is the
existence of the preferential dynamics in citations and the exponential growth in the number of publications (Facebook
posts). Here we pursue a numerical investigation on the rela tion between the Hirsch index ( h), citation number ( Ncit)
and total publication number ( Npub) of individual scientists on a large sample size. We intend t o validate also our
hypothesis regarding the Tsallis-Pareto shape of the proba bility density for the citation distribution and to reconsi der
the universality of the scaling exponent b.
Data are collected using a crawler internet robot, mapping t he Google Scholar website.
In collecting citations we have started form a strongly conn ected author (Prof. H.E. Stanley) and mapped recur-
sively his coauthor network. In this manner we collected the relevant data for 44 360 researchers with Ncit≥10000
andNpub≥100. These limits were imposed in order to have enough data fo r constructing the probability density
function. For each researcher, the Tsallis-Pareto ﬁt was do ne automatically by covering the b∈(1,8) values with a
∆b=0.025 step. We searched for that bvalue here for which we obtain the minima of the average relat ive diﬀerence

Here Wdenotes the number of experimental points used to quantify t he distribution. We used the cumulative distribu-
tion function C(x) in order to have a smoother distribution of the experimenta l data. The logarithm was considered in
order to ﬁt accurately also the tail of the distribution, ens uring that all data points have the same order of magnitude.
On Figure 2 we ﬁrst illustrate for a few randomly selected res earchers with largely di ﬀerent citation numbers the
validity of the Tsallis-Pareto PDF for their citations usin gbexponents determined by our method. Here we collapsed
the probability density functions for the citation distrib ution by considering the values relative to the mean and plot ting
ρ(x/∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright) as a function of x/∝angbracketleftx∝angbracketright.

Figure 2: Validity of the Tsallis-Pareto form for the citati ons distribution. On the upper ﬁgure we illustrate the case o f three researchers with
very diﬀerent Ncitnumbers. As the statistics gets better the Tsallis-Pareto ﬁ t also improves. In the ﬁgure from below we indicate the PDF fo r the
distribution of the sminparameter, indicating the goodness of the Tsallis-Pareto ﬁ t for diﬀerent researchers. The vertical line indicates the maximal
limit accepted for our study.
The goodness of the ﬁt can be characterized by the minimal svalue, denoted as smin. The obtained distribution of
thesminvalues is illustrated on log-log axes on the bottom Figure 2.
As we can observe from this Figure, the distribution has a lon g tail. Therefore we imposed an upper cuto ﬀat
smin=0.2, and disregard in our further investigation those few case s where the Tsallis-Pareto ﬁt is less reliable.
7Furthermore we disregarded also those cases where the best ﬁ t surpassed the imposed b=8 limit. From the initial
44360 studied researchers we remained with 43656 records.
The distribution of the ﬁtted bvalues for these researchers are given in Figure 5 where we ha ve used again log-log
axes. This distribution has a sharp peak around bmax=1.32 and indicates∝angbracketleftb∝angbracketright=1.58. The interval between the
maximum value and the average is in good agreement with the sc aling index suggested in our previous hypothesis
[22].
Using the data for the researchers which passed the ﬁlters we are ready now to study the validity of the scaling
relations presented in the previous section.

Figure 4: Distribution of the individualized Gini coe ﬃcient values for the studied researchers
Let us check ﬁrst the scaling between Ncit,Npubandh, as indicated in eq. (38). In order to illustrate this scalin g we
plot√Ncit/Npubas a function of h/Npubfor all the 43656 records. On Figure 3 we indicate the density of these points
8by two methods. In the top Figure we use a 2D density plot, and i n the bottom Figure we consider a 3D smoothed
histogram representation. From the density plot represent ation it is clear that for small h/Npubvalues√Ncit∝h,
conﬁrming the validity of the scaling expressed by eq. 26. Th e previously proposed scaling [3],√Ncit=2hworks
perfectly for the bulk of our results. This ﬁgure also shows t hat the limits derived from the maximal values of
Gintropy are applicable whenever we consider the b=∞limit. From here it a generally valid scaling follows, givin g
an interesting limit for the minimal number of citations for a given hvalue.

Ncit≥hlim
b→∞(1−1/b)−b/2=h√e (40)
This condition, Ncit≥eh2, is indeed much stronger than the obvious Ncit≥h2, and weaker than the previously
proposed Ncit=4h2, the latter works only for the main trend. The 3D plot (Figure 3b) indicates more convincingly
that the spread of the data from the main trend is actually nar row.
As we have mentioned previously, the Tsallis-Pareto type di stribution implies that the Gini coe ﬃcient satisﬁes:
G>1/2. For all the selected researchers’ publications we have co mputed the individualized Gini index for the
received citations. As expected, we ﬁnd a wide distribution that peaks at G=0.81, corresponding to b≈1.3,
indicating a large diversity for the citation numbers. The p robability density function illustrated in Figure 4 presen ts
a quite broad distribution, and we ﬁnd our initial lower boun dG=1/2 valid.
5. Discussion and Conclusions
The dimensionality of scientiﬁc performance has not only th eoretical interest. The collection and analysis of
scientiﬁc indicators is costly and complex. Reduction of th e needed indicators attracted attention from scientometri c
research (see for example [5] and its bibliography). There a re two approaches, the statistical one and the modelling
one (cf. again [5, 4]). Here we followed the former approach w ith particular attention to the incorporation of the
Hirsch index into the collection of indicators. The di ﬃculty hides in the fact that the deﬁnition of the Hirsch index
boils down to a functional equation which can not be solved ex plicitly. There are several studies which use parametric
assumptions in order to ﬁnd a good approximation for the Hirs ch index. Among others the Pareto distribution by
Glanzel in [6], geometric distribution by Bertoli-Barsott i & Lando [7], and the Weibull distribution used by [10] (see
also the review [11] ). A numerical calculation of the transc endental equation for H conform (10) and (12) is given in
[8].
Our ﬁrst aim was to obtain a general non-parametric scaling r elation for the h-index. In order to do so and to enjoy
the formal analogy and nice properties of the gintropy and th e survival description of the citation distribution, ﬁrst
we brieﬂy recalled the Gini index and gintropy. Then the very general but implicit scaling of the h-index was derived
with the aid of the gintropy formalism (21). Then we used the a ssumption that citations follow the Tsallis-Pareto
distribution to obtain a more explicit expression. Selecti on of the location parameter and check of the validity of the
arguments was done on Google Scholar data. In addition to the derivation of the scaling of the Hirsch index a new,
sharper upper bound is now given for the h-index (40).
The universal citation pattern, unveiled in our previous st udies [21, 22], is conﬁrmed here by a statistically elab-
orated study on data collected from Google Scholar. Without limiting the studied research ﬁeld in our statistical
analyses, we ﬁnd that the ﬁtted Pareto exponents are distrib uted close to the previously proposed b=1.4 value
(maximum at bmax=1.32 and mean at∝angbracketleftb∝angbracketright=1.58), but also show a heavy tail (Figure 5).
This ﬁnding, suggested that the individualized Gini index, calculated for the citations of the publications of in-
dividual authors, should satisfy G>1/2. It is indeed in agreement with the data observed in Google S cholar. As
a surprise we have learned, however, that the distribution o f these individualized Gvalues considered for all the
considered authors resembles a normal distribution that pe aks a very high value, Gmax≈0.81. This suggests a pro-
nounce inequality among the number of citations that resear chers receive for their publications. Furthermore, the
Pareto-Tsallis type form for the distribution of citations of articles authored by researchers leads to several intere sting
connections and limits, concerning the total number of publ ications, the total number of citations and the h-index.
The relation (38) derived from the Paretian shape of the dist ribution function is in agreement with data collected from

of the data points, that such a scaling should indeed be valid . It is surprising, however, that inspecting Figure 3 one
concludes that the previously proposed scaling [3]√Ncit=2hfollows more the peak of this distribution than the

Ncit≥100. To be compared with Figure 3
Finally, one should keep in mind that our statistical analys es are performed only on researchers with high pro-
ductivity ( Npub≥100) and large number of citations ( Ncit≥10000). Our starting hypothesis was already based on
the fact that the distribution function for the citations ca n be described with a Tsallis-Pareto form. For understandin g
the applicability limits of our results it worth considerin g their generalization for researchers that have much less
productivity and impact. Considering the limits Npub≥10 and Ncit≥100, and keeping by this in the statistics more
than 96% of the researchers mapped recursively with our craw ler, the results corresponding to Figure 3 are presented
now in Figure 6. The extended statistics suggests that the di stribution of the points (√Ncit/Npub,h/Npub) are more
10spread, however the scaling√Ncit=2hstill follows the main trend. The limit√Ncit≥√e his less evident, and
4.31% of the records violates it. This has to be compared with the case of largely cited researchers Npub≥100 and
Ncit≥10000, where only 0.16% of the researcher violates this limi t. All these results conﬁrm our initial working
hypothesis according to which the proposed limits and scali ng are based on the Pareto type distribution of citations,
and are derived assuming that one can construct such a distri bution function. Therefore one should be carefully with
these results for the majority of those researchers that hav e a minor number of publications and citations.
Deﬁnitely, one may consider to perform even more proper data analyses by using scientiﬁcally more solid databases,
like Web of Science or Scopus, however such studies should be more sophisticated in order to overcome the restrictive
user policy of these databases. This is the main reason we hav e used here the freely available, although possibly less
rigorous Google Scholar data.
