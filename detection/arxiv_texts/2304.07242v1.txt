Abstract. The pandemic of COVID-19 has inspired extensive works
across diﬀerent research ﬁelds. Existing literature and knowledge plat-
forms on COVID-19 only focus on collecting papers on biology and
medicine, neglecting the interdisciplinary eﬀorts, which hurdles knowl-
edge sharing and research collaborations between ﬁelds to address the
problem. Studying interdisciplinary researches requires eﬀective pa-
per category classiﬁcation and eﬃcient cross-domain knowledge extrac-
tion and integration. In this work, we propose Covidia ,COVID -19
interdisciplinary academic knowledge graph to bridge the gap between
knowledge of COVID-19 on diﬀerent domains. We design frameworks
based on contrastive learning for disciplinary classiﬁcation, and propose
a new academic knowledge graph scheme for entity extraction, relation
classiﬁcation and ontology management in accordance with interdisci-
plinary researches. Based on Covidia, we also establish knowledge dis-
covery benchmarks for ﬁnding COVID-19 research communities and pre-
dicting potential links.

1 Introduction
The pandemic of COVID-19 has aroused extensive attention of the academic re-
searchers all around the world, huge volume of research works are conducted and
published. Due to the profound and complex impact of COVID-19, the research
works do not only include scientiﬁc discoveries in biology and medicine [17],
but also require the collaborations from other ﬁelds, such as computer science,
sociology, mathematics, politics, etc. [13,36,22] to solve this problem with inter-
disciplinary insights [21]. However, the boom of COVID-19 publications and the
highly interdisciplinary collaborations result in a “paperdemic” [39,10], which
makes qualiﬁed information and knowledge retrieval harder. Organizing inter-
disciplinary works and extracting knowledge is a critical problem to solve.
However, organizing interdisciplinary research eﬀorts on COVID-19 is not
paid enough attention to, which hurdles information and knowledge sharing be-
tween diﬀerent ﬁelds. Existing COVID-19 literature datasets focus on collectingarXiv:2304.07242v1  [cs.IR]  14 Apr 20232 Authors Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

papers on biology and medicine [5,33,35] without considering publications in
other ﬁelds [7]. According to our statistics shown in Table 2, 48% out of 1.6
million publications on COVID-19 are not published in the venues of biology
or medicine. Besides, even though part of interdisciplinary works are published
in the biology and medicine venues, these works are not properly classiﬁed into
all other disciplines they belong to [32], which makes it hard for researchers to
draw the interdisciplinary insights, and diﬃcult for interdisciplinary researchers
to ﬁnd exact matches of their interests. Organizing interdisciplinary works is not
simply putting together all papers related to COVID-19, but organizing works
into the exact categories labelled by all related disciplines.
Further, knowledge extraction in interdisciplinary researches is not well stud-
ied, which makes knowledge isolated in respective ﬁelds. For example, COVID-
KG [36] extracts the bio-pharmaceutical and protein entities, and establishes
relations between entities from papers on COVID-19 in biomedical ﬁelds, while
GAKG [8] mines the knowledge entities in geoscience area. The ways of extract-
ing knowledge entities on these diﬀerent disciplines are diﬀerent, the knowledge
entities varies from each other, and even same words in diﬀerent ﬁelds can have
diﬀerent meanings. Therefore, it is challenging to extract knowledge from inter-
disciplinary works and integrate respective knowledge extracted.
In face of the above challenges, we propose frameworks to solve interdisci-
plinary paper classiﬁcation and knowledge extraction. First, we propose a multi-
label paper classiﬁcation model with contrastive learning on diﬀerent disciplines.
Thereafter, we enhance the entity extraction model to interdisciplinary scenarios
by aligning the entities to contents in Wikipedia to eﬀectively extract entities
with disciplinary contexts and eﬃciently adapt our model to open domains ofCovidia: COVID-19 Interdisciplinary Academic Knowledge Graph 3
interdisciplinary researches. We also propose an academic knowledge scheme
graph, where knowledge entities on ontology layers can be connected by shar-
ing same papers or bibliometric entities on instance layers, and vise versa, for
interdisciplinary knowledge integration.
In this work, we collect interdisciplinary papers on COVID-19, with size
of 1.5 million, and propose Covidia, a COVID -19interdisciplinary academic
knowledge graph (KG), to address the problems of information retrieval and
knowledge extraction of interdisciplinary researches on COVID-19. An overview
of Covidia with examples is demonstrated in Figure 1, the entire system and
resources will be publicly accessible after the ﬁnal draft, and our contributions
can be summarized as follows:
1. In this paper, we propose an ongoing interdisciplinary academic knowledge
graph on COVID-19, Covidia , which summarizes bibliometrics data, domain
glossaries, illustrations, tables, and spatio-temporal information of papers and
relations between them. To our knowledge, Covidia is the largest knowledge
graph and academic research literature platform for COVID-19.
2. This paper achieves interdisciplinary paper classiﬁcation by introducing con-
trastive learning over interdisciplinary categories. We introduce an entity ex-
tractionmodelbasedonlearningtorankandaBERT-basedrelationextraction
model using segment embedding. We deploy this model and extract knowledge
entities in the COVID-19 articles and relations between these entities.
3. In Covidia, we put forward a new academic knowledge graph scheme, adding
disciplinary categorization to knowledge entities, which facilitates researchers
on information retrieval and mining.

2 Covidia Overview
We ﬁrst present the overview of Covidia. There are 13concepts connected by
15relations in the Covidia and 34data properties. The distribution of the dis-
ciplines, are shown in Table 2. We can see that about half of the publications
on COVID-19 are not published in the venues of biology or medicine science. To
obtain ﬁne-grained knowledge in COVID-19 papers, we design the concept co-
vidia:knowledge representing the knowledge entities extracted from the papers.4 Authors Suppressed Due to Excessive Length
Meanwhile, Covidia use relation covidiar:mention_knowledge to connect the
knowledge entities and papers, design relations covidiar:is_A ,covidiar:impact
andcovidiar:related_to , then adopt owl:sameAs axioms linking knowledge enti-
ties to the outer entities. Furthermore, geohashis used to represented the points
of interest (POI). The schema-graph of the Covidia is shown in Figure 2.
The statistics of Covidia concepts and relations is shown in Table 1. The
knowledge graph consists of 6,097,866 instances and 24,705,417 links. To fa-
cilitatescholarsindatamining,knowledgeengineering,andinformationretrieval
to browse and access Covidia data eﬃciently, we provide a SPARQL endpoint.

3 Covidia Construction
In this section, we detail processes of building Covidia. We ﬁrst obtain data inte-
grated from diﬀerent paper sources and perform multi-label document classiﬁca-
tion to classify the papers. Meanwhile, we tag the specialized terms mentioned in
the articles. We perform open-domain information extraction for each COVID-
19-related paper, align the entity to the glossary, and classify their relations.
3.1 Collection and Fusion of Bibliometrics Data
We fuse the data by integrating papers from AceMap [31], CORD-19 [35], Digital
Science [25], and 58 preprint sites that were ﬂagged as being related to COVID-Covidia: COVID-19 Interdisciplinary Academic Knowledge Graph 5
19,normalizinginstitutions,andnamingscholars.Thedetailsofpapers,authors,
organizations and venues for each data source are listed in Table 3.

After Fusion 1,107,008 2,636,699 19,194 78,627
We extract the papers marked as “2019 20 coronavirus outbreak” ,“severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” and“Coronavirus disease 2019” in
Acemap, collect the papers published by CORD-19 since January 2020, and col-
lected the COVID-19 papers collected by Digital Science, using the query shared
[25], with the type of “article”,“proceeding” and“preprint” . At last, we collect
papers that study COVID-19 from 50 mainstream preprint websites. Each data
source focuses on a diﬀerent application scenario. We adopt scholars’ name dis-
ambiguation and organization normalization algorithms [31] to ﬁnish the infor-
mation fusion. We build a BERT-based named entity recognition model and use
SpaCy [16] tools to extract the geographical and political locations. After strict
normalization rules of the location entities, we deploy a GeoCoder to get the
location coordinates. Finally, we use the Geohash algorithm to store coordinates
to present the distribution of COVID-19 papers on a world map online.
All above, Covidia gathers all papers, scholars, institutions, and related bib-
liometric information about COVID-19 with papers’ illustrations, tables, knowl-
edge instances, and geographic locations extracted from the text.
3.2 Classiﬁcation of Interdisciplinary Papers
Pre-trained language models based document classiﬁcation model are the most
widely used [14]. Similar to [30], we develop an interdisciplinary classiﬁcation
model that combines the embeddings generated by SciBERT and contrastive
learning loss with 220,330 interdisciplinary annotated labels from Acemap.
To perform single-task ﬁne-tune BERT, we ﬁrst choose the BCE Loss with
logits viewing multi-disciplinary classiﬁcation as multiple binary classiﬁcation,
ℓ𝐵𝐶𝐸
𝑘=𝑦𝑖log¹𝑥𝑖º¸¹1 𝑦𝑖ºlog¹1 𝑥𝑖º (1)
where𝑘is denoted as the index of the batch, for each sample with index 𝑖,𝑥𝑖
is the predicted label, 𝑦𝑖is the ground true label. Meanwhile, intuitively two
articles with totally diﬀerent labels should be placed with a longer distance in
the latent space. Similar to [23,40], Covidia adopts a comparative learning loss6 Authors Suppressed Due to Excessive Length
functionInfoNCE Loss ,foreachdocument 𝑧wegenerateapairofaugmentations
for each sample in a batch 𝐵(with a sizej𝐵j), to reduce the loss as:
ℓ𝐶𝐿
𝑖= logexp¹𝑠𝑖𝑚¹𝑧𝑖1𝑧𝑖2º𝜏ºÍ
𝑗2𝐵𝜎exp 𝑠𝑖𝑚 𝑧𝑖1𝑧𝑗𝜏 (2)
where𝑧𝑖1𝑧𝑖2is a positive pair, 𝜎is an indicator function and 𝜏denotes the
temperature parameter setting as 0.5. The ﬁnal loss function is:
𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠=ℓ𝐵𝐶𝐸
𝑘¸ℓ𝐶𝐿
𝑘 (3)
We employ this model as a baseline, discussed in section 4. After multi-label
discipline classiﬁcation, we get the discipline distribution as shown in Figure 3:
Fig.3: Disciplines Distribution in Covidia.
At last, we use this ﬁne-tuned model as a new encoder to generate all the
embeddings of the paper in Covidia.
3.3 Extraction of Knowledge Entities
Distribution of discipline glossary can provide potential connections between
papers that have neither citation relations nor the same authors. Now we intro-
duce the pipeline to extract knowledge instances and the referred locations from
papers text.
For 22 disciplines, we have collected high-quality wiki entities, corresponding
discipline glossary sets and discipline knowledge graphs as a set of disciplines
knowledge. We ensure that each discipline has a high-quality discipline glossary,
with disciplines knowledge graphs as replenishment. Meanwhile, for the sake of
disambiguation, we invite experts from various disciplines to separate entities
and claim them as the concept Covidia:knowledge , so that they can be linkedCovidia: COVID-19 Interdisciplinary Academic Knowledge Graph 7
to the entities in the original knowledge graphs through the assertion of the
#sameAs .
With the above disciplines knowledge sets, discipline knowledge graphs and
wiki entities, we need to match the sentences in the papers semantically. Once
the sentences in the text are semantically close to or directly refer to the disci-
pline glossary sets and discipline knowledge entities, we can claim the relation
ofmention_knowledge . Therefore, referring to explicit semantic analysis (ESA)
[12], we ﬁrst convert the terms that may be associated in an abstract through the
vector transformation of TF-IDF [28]. In this process, we regard all the glossary
and nodes in knowledge graphs in the table as entities, and their descriptions as
documents 𝐷, view papers’ abstracts as a query 𝑞to ﬁnd the words in the text.
Thus, we can get the candidate entities 𝐸.
𝐸=𝑄¹𝑞𝐷º 𝐸=f𝑒𝑖g𝑖0 (4)
Second, we take each entity’s TF-IDF score, length, complexity, and let-
ters’ amount as the feature vector, consulting the LambdaRank [26], one of
the learning to rank algorithms, we try to learn the function where given
a text𝑞, return with 𝑛-dims entities 𝐸, with related 𝑛-dims scores 𝑆, like
𝑓¹𝑞𝐸º=𝑆 𝐸=𝑒𝑖𝑆=𝑠𝑖𝑖0. Then we train a two-layer neural network,
combining the feature vectors of entities and a loss function towards a pair as
equation 6 to ensure that factor NDCG [20] can ﬁnally reach a certain level.

where𝜎isaparametershapingthe sigmoidfunction.Thebinarylabelweusedto
calculate the NDCG is annotated by experts from various disciplines, according
to every pair of paper and candidate entities generated by the ESA step.
Finally, by setting the threshold, a considerable result is obtained. In this
process, we sacriﬁced the recall rate in order to ensure accuracy. Overall, the
precision of our model on the benchmark we set is 0.914, and the recall rate is
0.391. The pipeline of the model is shown in Figure 4.

3.4 Classiﬁcation of Relation Between Knowledge Entities
In addition to bibliometric data, Covidia also mines the relations between knowl-
edge entities mentioned in the papers to construct a knowledge graph for each
paper. By recognizing the relations between knowledge entities of the papers,
research can do reasoning over knowledge entities. Referring to the deﬁnitions of
knowledge engineering and common sense knowledge graph, we deﬁne three re-
lationsis_A,impact, andrelated_to . We ﬁrst extract triples through the general
open-domain triple extraction tool OpenIE[2]. For each paper, we extracted an
average of 53triples. For each paper 𝑝we have
𝑂𝑝𝑒𝑛𝐼𝐸¹𝑝º=¹ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑜º (6)
whereℎ𝑜and𝑡𝑜denotes the origin entities, and 𝑟indicates the relations ex-
tracted by the OpenIE. Then, we align the obtained head entity and tail entity
with the entity obtained in the previous section by adopting the exact match rule
to ensure accuracy to align and get the normalized head entity and tail entity ℎ
and𝑡. After that, we obtain persistent annotation data by deploying the Human-
in-the-Loop system. We set the obtained annotations quadruple (sentence, head
entity, relation, tail entity, label) as¹𝑠𝑔𝑟𝑡𝑙º, where𝑙iscovidiar:is_A ,co-
vidiar:has_impact ,covidiar:is_A , andunknown .
Fig.5: Input embedding of interdisciplinary classiﬁcation model.
Based on BERT, we design a linear layer as the task-speciﬁc layer for relation
classiﬁcation. The input to BERT is a single sentence with annotated entities
and relations. Then we use the sum of three vectors to encode the input, of
which token embedding is the WordPiece word vector, and segment embedding
is specially designed, (embedding value 1 if the token is one of the elements in
the triple, and the rest is 0), and a trainable position embedding. Finally, the
probability is obtained through the 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 layer, and the output probability
is as follows,

where hstands for the output of the encoder and Wis the parameter of the
linear layer. Furthermore, the model parameters are optimized by maximizing
thelog-probabilityofthecorrectlabel.ThespeciﬁcprocessisasFigure5.Finally,
we process the model over the entire COVID-19 papers.
4 Evaluation
This section will evaluate and demonstrate the methods we use to construct
the Covidia. We make benchmarks for Multi-Label Document Classiﬁcation,
phrase extraction, and open domain relation classiﬁcation on our dataset and
compare several baselines. In multi-disciplinary classiﬁcation, we choose AUC as
the measure, use precision and recall in the experiment for phrase extraction and
open domain relationship classiﬁcation, and obtain the ﬁnal result by delineating
a reasonable threshold. All the benchmarks can be accessed after the ﬁnal draft.
4.1 Interdisciplinary Papers Classiﬁcation
Dataset We also constructed a mapping of COVID-19 articles and discipline
labels based on the Covidia. Each article has at least two to four discipline
labels. Our discipline labels are collected from digital science. The entire dataset
contains 40,000 articles, including the articles’ titles, abstracts, and IDs. For this
dataset, the distribution of disciplines is as Figure 6.
Fig.6: The distribution of the disciplines in the training set.
Evaluation We assessed our method and some other baselines on the task of
multi-label document classiﬁcation. We compare LAHA [18], SciBERT+FT ,
andSciBERT+CL where SciBERT+FT is a model ﬁnetuning the SciBERT
with BCE Loss on language model downstream multi-label classiﬁcation task;
SciBERT+CL is the model using contrastive learning mechanism.10 Authors Suppressed Due to Excessive Length
As shown in the Table 4, the model trained with contrastive learning loss
has the highest AUC, although the precision and ranking metric NDCG is com-
parable. In order to enable the embedding of articles to contain classiﬁcation
information of diﬀerent disciplines, we use the contrastive learning-based model.

4.2 Knowledge Entities Extraction
Dataset By deploying an annotation system for Human-In-The-Loop machine
learning, we allow experts in all disciplines to score our predicted phrases and
build a ranking dataset to ﬁnd the top entities in tagging phrases. The dataset
has collected more than 1000 articles with 50,000 phrase annotations.

Methods Precision Recall
ESA+BERT+L2R ( 1𝑠𝑡Loop) 0.859 0.292
ESA+BERT+L2R ( 2𝑛𝑑Loop) 0.872 0.331

ESA+TF-IDF+L2R ( 1𝑠𝑡Loop) 0.881 0.332
ESA+TF-IDF+L2R ( 2𝑛𝑑Loop) 0.914 0.391
Evaluation For the phrase tagging task, we compare ESA+L2R model using
TF-IDF, using BERT and Word2Vec as the feature constructing on our dataset.
Since we have manual annotations to help improve the model’s performance in
cycle to guarantee the precision, we sacriﬁce the recall so that our model can tag
out more accurate phrases. Meanwhile, we choose the best threshold on the test
set and test the selection over the benchmark. The results are shown in Table 5,
showing that the mechanism using TF-IDF in the second loop performs better
than the other models.
4.3 Relation Classiﬁcation
Dataset Relation classiﬁcation is the task of identifying the semantic relation
between two entities in the text. With the help of the annotation system, weCovidia: COVID-19 Interdisciplinary Academic Knowledge Graph 11
gather more than two thousand (triple, sentence, label) records. For the open
domain, we have designed two baselines for comparison to classify the relation
in the open domain into three categories, including is_A,subclass_of and a
superclass related_to to generalize the rest.
Table 6: Experimental results of Open-domain Relation Classiﬁcation
Precision Recall
SciBERT+FT 76.53 71.18
SciBERT+SEG 79.09 75.21
Evaluation We set 400 of them as the benchmark to evaluate the models.
We use precision and recall to evaluate these two models, and the results are
in Table 6, indicating that with re-designed segment embedding, the pre-train
model can perform better.
5 Covidia Application
Covidia has been applied to two COVID-19 academic scenarios, including but
not limited to retrieval of COVID-19-related papers via POI and semantic search
over Covidia RDF dataset. Meanwhile, the Covidia can also be applied to net-
work data mining as a heterogeneous network.
5.1 Geographic Search over Covidia
We provide the geographic locations mentioned in each paper. By visualizing the
results, as shown in Figure 7, we can see that the distribution of searched papers
varies for diﬀerent keywords. When we set the keyword to “women”, we can ﬁnd
that both Eurasia and North America are scorching areas, but when we look
for papers about “lockdown” , the diﬀerence between Eurasia and the Americas
is apparent, which can be explained by diﬀerent quarantine policies in diﬀerent
regions. Coincidentally, the discipline distribution of “computer science” tends
to be slightly less than that of “psychology” .
Based on geography information in Covidia, we provide a geographic search
overCovidia.First,researcherscaninputanyphrasestoqueryinCovidia,includ-
ing papers’ titles, abstracts, disciplines, and knowledge entities the COVID-19
papers mentioned. Researchers enter keywords in the input box, e.g., “Vaccine in
China”, and the related papers would be shown on the map. Besides, for better
user interaction, users can drag the map, zoom in and zoom out the map to
search for papers within the bounding box with speciﬁed keywords.12 Authors Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

ing Sciences”, (d) Discipline: “Psychology and Cognitive Sciences”.
5.2 Semantic Search over Covidia
Using Covidia, researchers can learn more about the relationship in COVID-19
academia. Covidia perform several examples, including one-hop queries, such as
returning articles that mention a particular knowledge point, two-hop queries,
such as retrieving illustrations in a particular area and retrieving places that an
aﬃliation usually studies as an example of a three-hop query. These queries can
be used in scientiﬁc research and scholarly communication about COVID-19.
Moreover, these queries are generally unanswerable by existing search engines
and diﬀer from the current academic platform.
5.3 Network Science on Covidia
Covidia provides four social networks to network science. There are two homo-
geneous networks, an author cooperation network and a citation network, which
can be used for author and paper classiﬁcation and COVID-19 community detec-
tion. Two paper-author networks are also obtained, including a bipartite graph
network between articles written by authors and a bipartite graph network be-
tween authors and papers cited by their papers, which can be used for reference
recommendations. The relevant data statistics and the corresponding distribu-
tion can be found in Table 7 and Figure 8.Covidia: COVID-19 Interdisciplinary Academic Knowledge Graph 13

6 Related Work
We brieﬂy review the related work of Covidia, including literature classiﬁcation,
information extraction, and COVID-19 related knowledge graph.
Literature Classiﬁcation. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, researchers
have deployed natural language processing models and developed suitable meth-
ods to understand the pandemic-related text material [6]. [14] provides an anal-
ysis of several multi-label document classiﬁcation models on the LitCOVID
dataset, and pre-trained language models [30] outperform others. [24,18] use
label correlation to estimate the similarity between papers. [34,32] classify and
evaluate interdisciplinary papers by designing catalogs and indicators.
Information Extraction in Literature. When building a KG, mining en-
tities and relations are main challenges. In the task of entity extraction, BERT-14 Authors Suppressed Due to Excessive Length
based [9] and BiLSTM-CRF [19] are mainstream, which have been deployed in
domain-speciﬁc scenarios like material science [37] and geoscience [8]. What’s
more, AutoPhrase [29] sheds light on unsupervised phase tagging. For relation
extraction, the works of mining relations between entities extracted from liter-
ature are rare and mainly in biomedical articles [3,5,1]. Meanwhile, the means
like OpenRE [15] share the idea of distant supervision on close-domain relation
extraction, while OpenIE [2] gives the open-domain task a brand new paradigm.
COVID-19 related Knowledge Graph. In COVID-19 scenarios, dimen-
sions.ai[25]providesasubsetofDigitalScienceviaasetofkeywordqueries,while
CORD-19 [35] provides a machine-readable research dataset. COVID-KG [36],
CKG [38], COVID-19 KG RDF database [4] and KG-COVID-19 [27] has col-
lected the COVID-19 related literature metadata and some of the key terms
related to the papers. and cause-and-eﬀect KG on COVID-19 pathophysiology
is proposed by [11]. A framework that can integrate heterogeneous biomedical
data to produce KGs was developed for COVID-19 [27].
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a novel COVID-19 interdisciplinary academic knowl-
edge graph, Covidia , which extracts knowledge from all COVID-19 related re-
search papers published in the major venues across diﬀerent disciplines. The
framework can not only beneﬁt the researchers on COVID-19, but also be lever-
aged to studying potential future pandemics. The techniques we propose to
generate interdisciplinary knowledge graphs are not limited to applications on
COVID-19, but can also be applied to any scenarios where knowledge from dif-
ferent domains needs integrating. Finally, the entire system of Covidia and its
resources will be publicly accessible after the ﬁnal draft.
