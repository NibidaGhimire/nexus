Abstract
We say that a graph is k-mixing if it is possible to transform any k-coloring into any other via a
sequence of single vertex recolorings keeping a proper colo ring all along. Cereceda, van den Heuvel and
Johnson proved that deciding if a graph is 3-mixing is co-NP- complete and left open the case k≥4. We
prove that for every k≥4,k-mixing is co-NP-hard.
LetGbe a graph. All the colorings considered in this paper are proper (th at is adjacent vertices receive
distinct colors). We saythat two coloringsare adjacent if they diﬀer on exactly one vertex. The conﬁguration
graph of the k-colorings of ak-colorable graph Gis the graph whose vertices are k-colorings of Gwith the
adjacency deﬁned above. A graph Gisk-mixing if itsk-conﬁguration graph of the k-colorings of Gis
connected. In the k-Mixing problem, we are given an integer kand ak-colorable graph Gand we want to
decide if Gisk-mixing. Cereceda, van den Heuvel and Johnson proved in [4] that t he following holds:
Theorem 1 (Cereceda, van den Heuvel, Johnson [4] ) .3-Mixing is co-NP-complete.
They also provedthat a 3-chromaticgraph1is never 3-mixing. Surprisingly, for any k≥4, the complexity
status of k-mixing for every k≥4 is open. Neither the fact that it belongs to co-NP or the co-NP har dness
has been proven.These problems were mentionned as open problems for instance in [2, 3, 6, 5]. We propose
a very simple proof that the problem is co-NP hard for every k≥4:
Theorem 2. For every k≥4,k-Mixing is co-NP-hard (even on (k−1)-colorable graphs where all the color
classes but at most 2are reduced to a single vertex).
To prove Theorem 2, the main idea consists in observing that Theore m 1 is equivalent to the following
statement: deciding if any 3-coloring of a bipartite graph Bcan be transformed into a 2-coloring is co-
NP-complete. We will call this problem the 3 -To-2 problem. The fact that the 3 -To-2 problem is co-NP-
complete is a direct consequence of the following lemma:
Lemma 3. A graph Gis3-mixing if and only if it is a bipartite graph and we can reach a 2-coloring from
any3-coloring.
Proof.Since 3-chromatic graphs are not 3-mixing [4], the ﬁrst condition ho lds (and can be checked in
polynomial time).
Assume now that Gis bipartite. If Gis 3-mixing then we can indeed transform any coloring cinto every
2-coloring of Gby deﬁnition of being mixing. Conversely, if any coloring cofGcan be transformed into a
2-coloring c′then let us prove that there always exists a transformation betwe en any pair of colorings c1,c2.
By assumption, c1can be transformed into a 2-coloring c′
1with a sequence S1andc2can be transformed
into a 2-coloring c′
2with a sequence S2. Up to a recoloring of the vertices colored 2 with 1 or 0, we can
assume that the set of colors used in c′
1is{1,2}and inc′
2is{0,1}.
Let us denote by X0,X1the vertices colored respectively 0 and 1 in c′
2. So we can successively recolor
inc′
1all the vertices of X0with color 0 and then all the vertices of X1with color 1. So we can transform c1
intoc′
2. We append to this transformation S2in the reverse order to get transformation from c1toc2.

1A graph is k-chromatic if it is k-colorable and is not ( k−1)-colorable.
1Using this lemma we can prove Theorem 2:
Proof of Theorem 2. Letk≥4. Let us provide a reduction from 3 -To-2 tok-Mixing . We can assume that
the instance of 3 -To-2 is a bipartite graph B, otherwise we immediately return a no instance. Consider the
graphGconsisting of Bplusk−3 vertices Xinducing a clique which are complete to B. We claim that G
isk-mixing if and only if every 3-coloring of Bcan be transformed into a 2-coloring.
If one cannot reach a 2-coloring from a 3-coloring cofB, then no vertex of Xcan be recolored in any
coloring reachable from c(every vertex of Xbeing adjacent to the 3-colors of Bplus the k−4 colors of the
other vertices of Xin any coloring reachable from c). SoGis notk-mixing.
Conversely, assume that any coloring 3-coloring of Bcan be transformed into a 2-coloring. Let c1,c2be
twok-colorings of G. Since 3 -To-2 is positive if and only if Bis 3-mixing, we can reach from c1andc2two
colorings c′
1andc′
2such that c1[X] =c′
1[X],c2[X] =c′
2[X] and, vertices of Bare 2-colored in both c′
1and
c′
2with the same color classes denoted B1andB2(but not necessarily the same colors).
We now identify all the vertices of B1andB2inG. The colorings c′
1andc′
2are still properly deﬁned
(since all the vertices of B1andB2are colored the same in both colorings). The resulting graph is a clique
onk−1 vertices. We can now recolor the clique on O(k) steps (see e.g. in [1]) and this recoloring can be
transformed into a recoloring from c′
1toc′
2inO(n) steps as observed for instance in [1].
We conclude the paper with the following conjecture:
Conjecture 1 (Cereceda, van den Heuvel, Johnson [4]) .For every k≥4,k-Mixing is PSPACE-complete.
Notethatif k-MixingisPSPACE-completeforsome kthenitdoesnotimplythat k′-MixingisPSPACE-
completefor k′≥k. However,the proofofTheorem2ensuresthatif k-Mixingrestrictedto( k−1)-chromatic
graphsis PSPACE-complete, then the sameholds for k′≥k. We actuallyconjecturethat the followingholds:
Conjecture 2. 4-To-3is PSPACE-complete.
