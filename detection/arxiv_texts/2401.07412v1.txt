DYNAMICAL DISPLACEMENTS, PERSISTENCE AND
SEMICONJUGACIES
PHILIP BOYLAND
Abstract. This survey gives a unified treatment of topics from Abelian and non-Abelian
Nielsen Theory integrated with the semiconjugacy theorems of Franks and Handel. The
main focus is to develop an analog of the rotation set that is valid when the dynamics are
not isotopic to the identity and to connect this theory to the dynamical persistence under
homotopy/isotopy intrinsic in the theorems of Franks and Handel. For this dynamical
persistence, expansion/hyperbolicity at some scale is essential.
1.INTRODUCTION
When confronted with complicated systems, a standard mathematical strategy is to construct
simpler invariants which reveal at least part of the structure. In dynamical systems on
manifolds one implementation of this strategy begins with the rotation vector of an orbit.
The direction of the rotation vector indicates the direction of the asymptotic motion of the
orbit in first homology while its length indicates the speed. The rotation vector is computed
by lifting the dynamics to the universal Abelian cover and taking a Birkhoff average of the
displacements of the lifted orbit. The rotation vectors of all the orbits are collected in the
desired invariant, the rotation set.
One shortcoming of this strategy is that it only works when the dynamics is homotopic to
the identity or, more generally, acts like the identity on first homology. So if the dynamics
is generated by f:M→M, the method requires A(f) := ( f1)∗:H1(M)→H1(M) be
A(f) =I. The reasons for this restriction are at least twofold. First, when A(f)̸=Ithe
displacement of an orbit in the universal Abelian cover ˜Madepends on the choice of the lift.
Second, if A(f) has eigenvalues outside the unit circle, orbits will be running off to infinity at
an exponential rate and a simple Birkhoff average won’t work. Thus when A(f)̸=Idifferent
methods are needed and in this paper we present three, which turn out to be equivalent.
For simplicity of exposition let us assume that Mis a smooth, connected orientable mani-
fold with H1(M;Z) =Zb, torsion free. The first method starts with periodic points. Defining
the displacement of a lifted k-periodic point in the kth-order Bowen-Franks group
BFk(A(f)) =Zb
(A(f)k−I)Zb
makes it independent of the choice of the lift. We shall see in Section 5.3 that BF k(A) can
be naturally identified with Fix(Φk
A) where Φ A:Tb→Tbis the toral endomorphism induced
by the matrix A(f). Passing to a direct limit yields BF ∞(A(f)) which corresponds to the
collection of all periodic points of Φ A. Thus the displacement of a periodic point associates
it with a unique periodic point of Φ A.
1arXiv:2401.07412v1  [math.DS]  15 Jan 2024To work with general, non-periodic orbits we require more conditions on the action A(f)
offon first homology. Let us assume it is H1-expanding which means all its eigenvalues
are outside the unit circle ( H1-hyperbolic is similar). The Abel-Jacobi-Albanese map allows
us to compare lifted orbits of fto the universal Abelian cover with lifted orbits of Φ Ain
Rb. The H1-expanding hypothesis yields that lifts of periodic points of fstay a uniformly
bounded distance from the lift of the point in BF ∞(A(f)) to which it corresponds. This is
expressed by saying the two orbits globally shadow . This is a notion that works with general
orbits and a variant of the proof of the shadowing lemma says that each orbit o(x, f) globally
shadows an orbit ( y,ΦA). The assignment α:x7→yyields a semiconjugacy of facting on
Mto Φ Aacting on the invariant subset α(M)⊂Tb.
The second approach works directly with the lifted iterates of fin˜Maby normalizing
˜fkby the rate A−k. The limit converges and again yields a semiconjugacy β:M→Tbof
(M, f) into ( Tb, ϕA). It is shown that βis the same as αobtained from global shadowing.
This method is closest to Franks original construction of this semiconjugacy in [21].
In the third approach a finite segment of a general orbit of fis approximated by the
closest periodic orbit of Φ A. The f-orbit is assigned to the limit of these Φ A-orbits in Tb.
The resulting map turns out to be the same as α=βof the previous paragraphs.
The three approaches all yield the same semiconjugacy which compares and connects the
dynamics of fwith those of the toral endomorphism Φ A. The image in Tbcaptures all the
asymptotic dynamics of fas measured in first homology.
In the special case that M=Tbthe semiconjugacy turns out to be onto yielding the fol-
lowing interpretation. If f:Tb→Tbis such that A(f) is expanding, then fis semiconjugate
to Φ A. This means that all the dynamics of Φ Aare present in any homotopic map. This,
and its H1-hyperbolic version, is the context in which Franks Theorem is usually seen.
The second main part of the paper studies what can be viewed as a non-Abelian analog
of Franks Theorem. In this case we work with the universal cover and so start by defining
displacements as twisted conjugacy classes in π1(M). This is the realm of classical Nielsen
Theory. The semi-conjugacy theorem in this context, due to Handel [28], requires metric
expansion/hyperbolicity in the universal cover along with conditions on the periodic orbits of
f. The prototypical example of such maps are pseudoAnosov homeomorphisms on compact
surfaces.
Most of the mathematics covered here is well established. The novel features are the
integrated approach and perhaps Section 5 including the direct limit of the Bowen-Franks
groups. The essential sources include Jiang’s excellent expositions of Nielsen Theory [29, 31]
and the papers of Franks [21], Handel [28], Shub [39], Fathi [19], and Fried [24, 25]. Band
first used the connection of shadowing to the Franks map in [4]. Bouwman and Kwapisz
added Abelian Nielsen equivalence to this connection in their work on Hirsch’s problem
(Section 13)[8] and the connection was explored in a general context by Gromov [26].
To simplify the exposition we have mainly dealt with the case of expansion and just remark
on hyperbolicity. Also, rather than break the flow with frequent references, we include them
with comments in a Context subsection. The bibliography here is not exhaustive and we
encourage the interested reader to consult the bibliographies of the references. Finally, we
will use maps on the wedge of two circles as examples. While the space is obviously not a
smooth manifold all the methods here work with very minor modification.

2.THE UNIVERSAL ABELIAN COVERING SPACE
As noted in the introduction one of the goals of this paper to measure the asymptotic motion
of orbits in homology. Working in the manifold itself often leads to ambiguities and so one
unwraps the manifold into a covering space, lifts the dynamics to the cover, and measures
the displacement of orbits there. Since we measuring the motion of orbits in homology, the
appropriate covering space is the universal Abelian cover ,π:˜Ma→M. This space has
no natural algebraic structure outside of the deck group, so we use a classical technique to
construct a map ˜ ι:˜Ma→Rband use the vector space structure of the images to measure
orbit progress.
2.1.THE COVERING SPACE
For simplicity of exposition, we let Mbe a smooth, connected, orientable, compact manifold
with H1(M;Z)∼=Zbtorsion-free with b >0. A compact, orientable surface with negative
Euler characteristic is a good example to keep in mind. The dynamics will be given by
f:M→Mcontinuous, onto and orientation preserving.
The universal Abelian cover is built by moding out the universal cover by the action of
the commutator subgroup of the fundamental group. The deck group of ˜MaisZband the
deck transformation corresponding to ⃗ n∈Zbis denoted δ⃗ n. A fundamental property of ˜Ma
is that a closed loop γ: [0,1]→Mwith γ(0) = γ(1) lifts to a closed loop in ˜Maif and only
if it is zero in homology.
The action of fon the fundamental group preserves the commutator subgroup, and so
every flifts to ˜f:˜Ma→˜Ma. The collection of all possible lifts of fis given by δ⃗ n˜ffor all
⃗ n∈Zb. The fundamental relationship between lifts and deck transformations is
˜f◦δ⃗ n=δA⃗ n◦˜f (2.1)
where A= (f∗)1:H1(M;Z)→H1(M;Z) is the induced map on homology.
Notation 2.1. Henceforth the action of fon first homology will be denoted f∗and the linear
transformation A=A(f)will always represent that action. We will not be considering higher
degree homology in this paper.
2.2.MAPPING ˜MaINTORb
Pick a basis Γ 1, . . . , ΓbforH1(M;Z) and a basis of harmonic one-forms ω, . . . , ω bforH1
DR(M;R)
which are dual in the sense that
ωi(Γj) =δij (2.2)
(Kronecker delta). Lift the ωito˜Maas ˜ωiand fix a point ˜ x0∈˜Ma. For ˜ x∈˜Machoose a
smooth path γfrom ˜ x0to ˜xand for i= 1, . . . , b define ˜ ι:˜Ma→Rby
˜ιi(˜x) =Z
γ˜ωi. (2.3)
3Since the forms are closed, this is independent of the choice of path γand using (2.2),
˜ι◦δ⃗ n= ˜ι+⃗ n (2.4)
Thus ˜ ιdescends to map ι:M→Tb.
The map ιis often not injective. A trivial example is when the first betti number bis less
than the dimension of the manifold. In many cases of interest, for example closed surfaces
with negative Euler characteristic, ˜ ιis injective and is thus an embedding. In these cases,
one can treat ˜Maas being inside Rband eliminate all the ˜ ι’s from the succeeding formulas.
The formulas are then much neater and intuitive.
However, using (2.4), ˜ ιis always bijective on any set {δ⃗ n˜x:⃗ n∈Zb}for ˜x∈˜Ma. In
addition, ιalways induces a surjective map on first homology: given ⃗ n∈Zbpick any path
γin˜Mafrom ˜ x0toδ⃗ n˜x0. Then π◦γis closed curve Γ ⊂Mwith ( ι∗)1([Γ]) = ⃗ n, again using
(2.4).
2.3. FORMULA FOR ˜f
Define ˜ σ:˜Ma→Rbby ˜σ(˜x) = ˜ι˜f(˜x)−A˜ι(˜x) and so ˜ σis continuous. Using (2.4) and (2.1),
˜σ(˜x+⃗ n) = ˜σ(˜x) and so ˜ σdescends to a function on the compact space M. As a consequence
we will usually write just σ(x) for ˜ σ(π(˜x)). Since Mis compact, σis bounded. The desired
formula for ˜ ι˜fis then
˜ι˜f(˜x) =A˜ι(˜x) +σ(x). (2.5)
2.4. CONTEXT
The classical version of the map ιis the Abel-Jacobi map on a compact Riemann surface using
holomorphic one-forms. The generalization to higher dimensional Riemannian manifolds is
also sometimes called the generalized Abel-Jacobi map or else the Albanese map or even the
Abel-Jacobi-Albanese map ([26]). Its use was introduced into the study of rotation sets by
Mather [35].
3.THE TRANSLATION AND THE CASE f∗=I
3.1. THE TRANSLATION
We use the Abelian cover to measure the motion of a point ˜ xin homology under a single
iterate. The translation in˜Mathat a point ˜ xexperiences under a lift ˜fis
∆(˜x,˜f) := ˜ι˜f(˜x)−˜ι(˜x) = (A−I)˜ι(˜x) +σ(x) (3.1)
using (2.5). Note that ∆ depends on the choice of lift of ˜fis a simple way: changing ˜fto
δ⃗ n˜fsimply changes ∆ to ∆ + ⃗ n. On the other hand, if we change the lift of xtoδ⃗ n˜xthe
translation becomes
∆(δ⃗ n˜x) = ∆(˜ x) + (A−I)⃗ n. (3.2)
The goal here is to define an asymptotic average translation for a given point ˜ x∈˜Ma.
We want this to depend just on the point x. The formula (3.2) indicates exactly how to
compensate for changing a lift of xand we will pursue this in the next section after discussing
an important special case.
43.2. THE CASE f∗=I
Assume facts trivially on first homology, from (3.2) ∆( δ⃗ n˜x) = ∆(˜ x) and further, from
(3.1) ∆(˜ x,˜f) =σ(x) and so we may write the displacement as a function of x∈Mas
∆(x) =σ(x) suppressing the choice of lift of f. Iterating the translation after niterates
yields ˜ ι˜fn(˜x)−˜ι(˜x) =σ(x) +. . . σ(fn−1(x)) with the σ-terms uniformly bounded. Thus
˜ι˜fn(˜x)−˜ι(˜x) grows at most linearly and so it is natural to take the Birkhoff average and
define the rotation vector
ρ(x) = lim
n→∞1
nn−1X
i=0∆(fi(x)) = lim
n→∞˜ι˜fn(˜x)−˜ι(˜x)
n. (3.3)
This limit exists at almost every point of an invariant measure by Birkhoff’s Pointwise
Ergodic Theorem. The rotation set of f,ρ(f), is then the union of all the rotation vectors.
The most common situation studied where f∗=Iis when fis homotopic or isotopic
to the identity, but it is worth noting that there are interesting examples in which facts
trivially on first homology but the action on the fundamental group is quite complex. A
good example is given by psuedoAnosov maps in the Torelli subgroup of the mapping class
group of a compact surface [17]. The next example shows this phenomenon in a map on the
wedge of two circles.

Right: A fundamental domain and its image under the map ˜ϕ1.
3.3. EXAMPLE
LetXbe the wedge of two circles as pictured in Figure 1. The universal Abelian cover
˜XaisZ×R∪R×Zwhich sits naturally in R2and we write ˜ x+⃗ nforδ⃗ n˜x. Consider
the homomorphism ψ1of the free group on two symbols F2∼=π1(X) induced by a7→
aaba−1b−1, b7→b−1a−1bba. Let ϕ1:X→Xbe the map that realizes this action in the
tightest fashion, so ϕ′
1= 5 except at the vertex. Lift ϕ1to˜ϕ1:˜X→˜Xwhich fixes the
origin. Figure 1(right) shows the image under ˜ϕ1of a fundamental domain of ˜X.
While ϕ1is not homotopic to the identity, it does act like the identity on H1and so we
may compute its rotation set. Now ˜ϕ1(˜x+⃗ n) =˜ϕ1(˜x) +⃗ n, and so it suffices to understand
the displacements of a fundamental domain. Letting tbe the horizontal deck transformation
5(adding (1 ,0)) and rthe vertical one (adding (0 ,1). Using Figure 1 we compute the various
displacements of a lift of each of the two circles. This information is encoded in the transition
matrix
M=
1 +t+tr t +t2
r−1t−1+t−1r r−1+t−1+r−1t−1.
where, for example, M(1,1) says that there are transitions a→awhich translate by
(0,0),(1,0), and (1 ,1) in the cover. Next observe that any recurrent allowable sequence
of transitions can be constructed by taking the concatenation of minimal loops, i.e. cycles
of allowable transitions which make each transition at most once. Concatenating loops cor-
responds to taking the Farey sum of their rotation vectors. As a consequence, the rotation
set is the convex hull of the minimal loops. In this example the minimal loops are all length
one or two and so can be computed from the traces of MandM2. The rotation vectors of
fixed points are shown in Figure 2 as circles and those of the period two points by x’s.

3.4. CONTEXT
The study of the simplest version of this rotation vector on the circle goes back to Poincar´ e.
The general case on manifolds for flows was initiated by Schwartzman and Fried [38, 24].
The adaption of these methods to iterated maps requires just minor modification. There
is a large literature on certain case, especially on the two-dimensional annulus and torus.
For computing the rotation set using a lifted Markov partition with references see [11]. The
general case of an observable on a subshift of finite type is in Ziemian [41].
4.FIXED AND PERIODIC POINTS
To compute the asymptotic displacement in the general case of A̸=Iwe first work with
fixed and periodic points and in the next section deal with general orbits
4.1.DISPLACEMENTS OF FIXED POINTS AND THE BOWEN -FRANKS GROUP
Assume that x∈Fix(f) and so for lifts ˜ x,˜fthere is an n∈Zbwith ˜f(˜x) =δ⃗ n˜x. Using
(2.4), ∆(˜ x,˜f) =⃗ n. Thus for fixed points we can obtain the translation without using the
map ι. From (3.2) to get a translation independent of the choice of lift of xwe define the
6displacement ofxas
D(x,˜f) = ∆(˜ x,˜f) + (A−I)Zb∈Zb
(A−I)Zb:= BF 1(f) (4.1)
where ˜ xis any lift of x. The fixed point displacement set offis
D1(f) ={D(x,˜f) :x∈Fix(f)} ⊂BF1(f)
where we suppress the choice of lift ˜f. The BF stands for Bowen-Franks and the group BF 1
occurs in many contexts, see section 14 below. Using the Smith normal form BF 1(f) is a
finite group of order det( A−I) when one is not an eigenvalue of A.
4.2. EXAMPLE 2
Consider the homomorphism ψ2:F2→F2induced by a7→aaab, b 7→bbba. Let ϕ2:X→X
be its tight map and lift ˜ϕ2as in Example 3.3. After computing the image of a fundamental
domain the rest of the action of ˜ϕ2can be determined by the formula ˜ϕ2(˜x+⃗ n) =˜ϕ2(˜x)+A2⃗ n
where
A2= (ϕ2)∗=
3 1
1 3
is the action on H1(X,Z)≡Z2.
Let Γ = ( A2−I)Z2and so BF 1(A2) =Z2/Γ∼=Z3using the Smith normal form. In the
fundamental domain there are lifts of 5 distinct fixed points, (0 ,0),(1/3,0),(2/3,0),(0,1/3),
and (0 ,2/3). Computing, ϕ(1/3,0) = (1 /3,0) + (1 ,0) and so D(1/3,0) = (1 ,0) + Γ. Similar
computations yield D(2/3,0) = (2 ,0) + Γ , D(0,1/3) = (0 ,1) + Γ, and D(0,2/3) = (0 ,2) + Γ.
Now note that (1 ,0)−(0,1) = ( A2−I)(1,−1)T∈(A2−I)Z2and so D(1,0) = D(0,1).
Similarly, D(2,0) = D(0,2). Also, (1 ,0)−(2,0)̸∈(A2−I)Z2and so D(1,0)̸=D(2,0)
and similarly D(0,1)̸=D(0,2). Thus among the 5 fixed points of ϕthere are three distinct
displacements and so D1(ϕ) = BF 1(A2).
4.3.COMPARING FIXED POINTS
Let us explore the implications of two fixed points having the same displacement. So assume
˜f(˜x) =δ⃗ m˜xand ˜f(˜x′) =δ⃗ m′˜x′with ⃗ m′−⃗ m= (A−I)⃗ nfor some ⃗ n∈Zb. In this case,
˜f(δ⃗ n˜x) =δA⃗ n˜f(˜x) =δA⃗ nδ⃗ m˜x=δ⃗ m+(A−I)⃗ nδ⃗ n˜x=δ⃗ m′(δ⃗ n˜x). (4.2)
Thus δ⃗ n˜xand ˜x′are both fixed by the lift δ−⃗ m′˜f. We have proved the nontrivial half of the
fact that D(x) =D(x′) if and only if there are lifts ˜ x,˜x′and˜fwith ˜f(˜x) = ˜xand˜f(˜x′) = ˜x′.
Exploring further, consider an arc ˜ γ: [0,1]→˜Mawith ˜ γ(0) = ˜ xand ˜γ(1) = ˜ x′with ˜ xand
˜x′both fixed by the same lift ˜f. The arc ˜f◦˜γalso goes from ˜ xto ˜x′and so ˜ γ−1#(˜f◦˜γ) is a
closed loop in ˜Maand so pushing down to M,γ−1#(f◦γ) is homologous to zero in Mand
soγis homologous to f◦γrel endpoints. Following the steps in the other direction yields
the converse and so we summarize
Lemma 4.1. Forx, x′∈Fix(f)the following are equivalent.
•D(x,˜f) =D(x′,˜f)for some lift ˜f.
•There are lifts ˜x,˜x′and ˜fwith ˜f(˜x) = ˜xand ˜f(˜x′) = ˜x′.
•There is an arc γfrom xtox′so that γis homologous to f◦γrel endpoints.
74.4. EXAMPLE 2,CONTINUED
Recall that ∆(1 /3,0) = (1 ,0) and ∆(0 ,1/3) = (0 ,1) while (1 ,0)T−(0,1)T= (A2−I)(1,−1)T.
Thus using the calculation above, (0 ,1/3) + (1 ,−1) and (1 /3,0) should be both fixed by the
lift˜ϕ2−(1,0)Twhich is also easy to verify directly.
4.5. PERIODIC POINTS
The generalization to periodic points is straightforward. First note that not every lift of fk
is of the form ˜fkfor some lift ˜foff. So fix a lift ˜f(k)offkand assume x∈Fix(fk) and for
a lift ˜ x, let the translation be
∆k(˜x,˜f(k)) = ˜ι˜f(k)(˜x)−˜ι(˜x). (4.3)
To get a displacement independent of the choice of lift, let
Dk(x,˜f(k)) = ∆ k(˜x,˜f(k)) + (Ak−I)Zb∈Zb
(Ak−I)Zb:= BF k(f). (4.4)
Note that at this point we are just requiring that x∈Fix(fk) not that xhas least period k.
Ifxis a least period kpoint the displacements of other points on its orbit are simply related
byDk(fi(x),˜f(k)) =AiDk(x,˜f(k)).
Standing Hypothesis 4.2. Henceforth we assume that the linear transformation Ahas
no eigenvalues which are roots of unity. This implies that Ak−Iis invertible and that
BFk(A) =Zb
(Ak−I)Zbis a finite group for all k.
4.6. EXAMPLE 2,CONTINUED
Forϕ2, in contrast to the fixed point case, for k >1 there are far more possible displacements
in BF k(A2) than there are fixed points. The eigenvalues of A2are 2 an 4 and so the order
of BF k(A2) is det( Ak
2−I) = 8k−(2k+ 4k) + 1. So, for example, when k= 2 there are 45
different possible displacements in BF 2(A2).
On the other hand, using each circle in Xas a Markov box, the dynamics of ϕ2are
described by the edge shift of the matrix A2. When kodd, the vertex is counted twice and
when kis even, the vertex is counted four times. Thus # Fix( ϕk) = trace( Ak
2)−N1(k) =
2k+ 4k−N1(k) where N1(k) = 1 when kis odd and N1(k) = 3 when kis even. Thus, for
example, when k= 2 there are 18 fixed points in contrast to the 45 available displacements.
4.7. CONTEXT
In the language of Nielsen Theory the displacement as defined here is the Abelianization
of the twisted conjugacy class of a periodic point and the displacement class is the Abelian
Nielsen class. The order of BF k(f) gives a lower bound on the number of Nielsen classes of
order k.
5.THE DIRECT LIMIT GROUP BF∞
5.1.DEFINING THE DIRECT LIMIT
As noted in the introduction the goal of this paper is to build invariants of a dynamical
system which capture information about asymptotic dynamics using first homology. The
next step is to collect together the displacements of all the periodic points. The crucial, but
elementary, observation is that if x∈Fix(fi) and i|j(idivides j), then x∈Fix(fj). The
8algebraic analog of this fact allows us to build BF ∞, the direct limit of the groups BF i. Since
initially the consideration are strictly algebraic we work with a fixed square integer matrix
Awhich satisfies the standing hypothesis 4.2.
Let (N,≺) be the directed set of positive integers ordered by divisibility, so i≺jif and
only if i|j. When i≺jdefine
Cij=A(j
i−1)i+A(j
i−2)i+. . . Ai+I (5.1)
and so Aj−I=Cij(Ai−I). Let Γ i= (Ai−I)Zband for i≺jdefine Υ ij: BF i(A)→BFj(A)
via
⃗ n+ Γ i7→Cij⃗ n+ Γ j (5.2)
It is easy to check that Υ ijis a well-defined monomorphism and further, when i≺j≺kwe
have CjkCij=Cik. Thus
ΥjkΥij= Υ ik (5.3)
and so ( {Bi},{Υij},(N,≺)) is a directed system of Abelian groups and we define
BF∞(A) = lim− →BFi. (5.4)
We treat the direct limit as
BF∞(A) = (⊔BFi)/∼ (5.5)
where gi∈BFiandgj∈BFjare equivalent, gi∼gj, if and only if when i≺kandj≺k
then Υ ik(gi) = Υ jk(gj) in BF k. We denote equivalence classes as [ ·]. Recalling that elements
of the BF iare cosets using the definitions of the Υ ijthe product in BF ∞is
[⃗ n+ Γ i]·[⃗ n′+ Γ j] = [( Cik⃗ n+Cjk⃗ n′) + Γ k] (5.6)
when i, j≺k.
Remark 5.1. When i|jone can directly compare the displacement of x∈Fix(fi)inBFi
with the displacement of the same point as an element of Fix(fj). For x∈Fix(fi)we
have ˜ι˜fi(˜x) = ˜ι(˜x) + ∆ i(˜x)and so ˜ι˜f2i(˜x) = ˜ι(˜x) + ∆ i(˜x) +A∆i(˜x). Continuing if i|jwe
have ˜ι˜fj(˜x) = ˜ι(˜x) +Cij∆i(˜x)which is to say that ∆j(˜x) =Cij∆i(˜x)in agreement with the
definition of Υij.
Returning to the dynamics of f:M→Mwe collect together all the displacement data
of all periodic points in
D∞(f) =[
n∈N[
x∈Fix(fn)[Dn(x)]⊂BF∞(A). (5.7)
5.2. EMBEDDING BF∞(A)INTb
In this subsection we give a concrete realization of BF ∞(A) as a subgroup of the torus group
Tb=Rb/Zband in the next subsection discuss it dynamical significance.
Fix a matrix Asatisfying the standing hypothesis. For all i, define Ψ i: BF i(A)→Tbvia
(⃗ n+ Γ i)7→(Ai−I)−1⃗ n+Zb. (5.8)
This is easily seen to be well-defined. Now define Ψ : BF ∞(A)→Tbvia
[⃗ n+ Γ i]7→Ψi(⃗ n+ Γ i) (5.9)
9To check it is well-defined, assume that [ ⃗ n+ Γ i] = [⃗ n′+ Γ j] in BF ∞(A). This means that
there is a kwith i|kandj|kand a ⃗ m∈Zbwith
Cik⃗ n−Cjk⃗ n′= (Ak−I)⃗ m. (5.10)
Now Cik= (Ai−I)−1(Ak−I) and so substituting into (5.10) yields
(Ai−I)−1⃗ n−(Aj−I)−1⃗ n′=⃗ m∈Zb(5.11)
and so Ψ([ ⃗ n+ Γ i]) = Ψ([ ⃗ n′+ Γ j]) inTb.
To compute the kernel of Ψ, say that Ψ([ ⃗ n+ Γ i]) = 0 which is to say that ( Ai−I)−1⃗ n=
⃗ m∈Zb. But then ⃗ n= (Ai−I)⃗ mso⃗ n∈Γiand thus [ ⃗ n+ Γ i] = 0 in BF ∞(A) and Ψ is a
monomorphism.
Remark 5.2. The subgroup Ψ(BF∞(A))⊂Tbis isomorphic to the direct limit group
BF∞(A) = lim− →BFi(A)but it is worth noting that the topology of Ψ(BF ∞(A))induced as
a subset of Tbdoes not correspond to the direct limit topology on BF∞(A)which is discrete.
5.3.TORAL DYNAMICS AND BF∞A
Fix an integer matrix Athat satisfies the standing hypothesis and let Φ Abe the induced
toral endomorphism Φ A:Tb→Tb. The universal Abelian cover of Tbis also its universal
cover, Rb. The linear transformation A:Rb→Rbis a lift of Φ Aand it will be the preferred
lift when computing displacements.
We reverse our point of view and now instead of finding the displacement of a periodic
point we try to find a period kpoint of Φ Athat has a given displacement ⃗ n∈Rb. Thus
we must solve Ak˜x= ˜x+⃗ nand so ˜ x= (Ak−I)−1⃗ n. This always exists because Ahas no
eigenvalues that are roots of unity. Thus for all ⃗ nthere is a ˜ xwith ∆ k(˜x, Ak) =⃗ nand so
Dk(x, Ak) =⃗ n+ (Ak−I)Zb∈BFk(A). Thus the collection of displacements of ϕAis all
of BF ∞(A) or Ψ( D∞(A)) = Ψ( BF∞(A)). In words, all displacement classes of linear toral
endomorphisms are filled.
Next consider Fix(Φk
A) inside the toral group Tb=Rb/Tb. Define h:Zb→Tbvia
h(⃗ n) = (Ak−I)−1⃗ n+Zband so h(Zb) = Fix(Φk
A). Now ⃗ n∈ker(h) if and only if ⃗ n= (Ak−I)⃗ m
for some ⃗ m∈Zb. Thus ker( h) = (Ak−I)Zband so as groups, Fix(Φk
A)∼=BFk(A). This also
shows that Fix(Φk
A) is the image of BF k(A) under the monomorphism Ψ kof the previous
section.
Now we consider the relationship of BF ∞(A) with all the fixed points of Φ A,∪i∈NFix(Φi
A).
LetFi= Fix(Φi
A) and note that if x∈Fiandi|jthen x∈Fj. So when i|jdefine ϕij:
Fi→Fjbyϕij(x) = x. Using the directed set ( N,≺) under divisibility, we have that
({Fi},{ϕij},(N,≺)) is a directed system and let
F∞= lim− →Fi. (5.12)
Since ϕijis the identity and all the Fi⊂Tb, then F∞=∪Fi, the collection of periodic points
of Φ A, is a subgroup of Tb. We next see that this subgroup is isomorphic to BF ∞(A).
The equation (5.11) and the lines above it imply that ϕij◦Ψi= Ψ j◦Υijand so the map Ψ
in fact sends equivalence classes in BF ∞(A) = lim− →BFito equivalence classes in F∞= lim− →Fi
and thus the image of BF ∞(A) under the isomorphism Ψ is F∞, the collection of periodic
points of Φ A.
10Theorem 5.3. Given the linear transformation Asatisfying the standing hypothesis, the
collection of fixed points of the toral endomorphism ΦAis a subgroup of the torus group Tb
and can naturally be identified with the group BF∞(A)of possible displacements of ΦA. The
identification is simply that of a fixed point of Φi
Awith its displacement.
As a consequence, considering a general map f:M→Mwith H1(M;Z) =Zbandf∗=A,
the collection of its displacements is a subset of BF ∞(A) and this may also be viewed as a
subset of the periodic points of the total endomorphism Φ A. So the process of computing
displacements can be viewed as comparing the periodic points of fwith those of a toral
endomorphism. We explore this comparison more closely in the next section.
6.GLOBAL SHADOWING
6.1.THE COMPARISON MAP α
The map ˜ ι:˜Ma→Rballows us to compare ˜forbits and Aorbits. In the bases, this
corresponds to comparing orbits of fand Φ A. Specifically, we compare the lift ˜ xof a
periodic point of fto the point ˜ yto which is corresponds under the identification of the
last section. In symbols, if ˜f(k)(˜x) =δ⃗ n˜xwe know there is a point ˜ ywith Ak˜y= ˜y+⃗ n, or
∆k(˜x,˜f(k)) = ∆ k(˜y, Ak). Let ˜ α(˜x) = ˜yand so ˜ αmaps lifts of periodic points of fto lifts
of periodic point of Φ A. Recall that ∆ k(δ⃗ n˜x,˜f(k)) = ∆ k(˜x,˜f(k)) + (Ak−I)⃗ nand similarly
∆k(δ⃗ n˜x, A) = ∆ k(˜x, Ak) + (Ak−I)⃗ n. This implies that ˜ αdescends to a map αfrom the
periodic points of finMto the periodic points of Φ AinTb. The map αsends a period k
point for fto the unique period kpoint α(x)∈Tbwith Dk(x, fk) =Dk(α(x),Φk
A).
6.2. GLOBAL SHADOWING OF PERIODIC POINTS
Let ( x, f) and ( y,ΦA) be period kpoints. Assume that ˜ y= ˜α(˜x) and so for some ⃗ n, k
˜fk(˜x) =δ⃗ n˜xandAk˜y= ˜y+⃗ n. Given m∈Nwrite it as m=ik+jwith 0 ≤j < k .
Repeatedly using 2.1 yields
˜fik(˜x) =δ⃗ n+Ak⃗ n+···+A(i−1)k⃗ n˜x
and so
˜fm(˜x) =δAj(⃗ n+Ak⃗ n+···+A(i−1)k⃗ n)˜fj(˜x).
Thus
˜ι˜fm(˜x) = ˜ι˜fj(˜x) +Aj(⃗ n+Ak⃗ n+···+A(i−1)k⃗ n)
and a similar formula for Am˜y, and so
∥˜ι˜fm(˜x)−Am˜y∥=∥˜ι˜fj(˜x)−Aj˜y∥:=Kj (6.1)
The collection {Kj}is finite so we conclude there is a Kso that ∥˜ι˜fm(˜x)−Am˜y∥< K for
allm∈N.
Definition 6.1. Given a lift ˜f:˜Ma→˜Matwo orbits in the covers (˜x,˜f)and(˜y, A)are said
to shadow if there is a constant Kwith
˜d(˜ι˜fn(˜x), An(˜y))≤Kfor all n∈N (6.2)
where ˜d(˜x,˜y) =∥˜x−˜y∥inRb. Two orbits in the bases (x, f)and(y,ΦA)are said to globally
shadow if there are lifts ˜x,˜y,˜fthat shadow.
11There are a number of uses of shadowing and in a general context this form of shadowing
would be called Abelian global shadowing. The argument above shows
Lemma 6.2. Assume f:M→Mhasf∗=Aacting on H1≡Zbandxandyare period k
points of fandΦA, respectively. If Dk(x, fk) =Dk(y,Φk
A), or equivalently α(x) =y, then x
andyglobally shadow.
6.3. EXAMPLE 2CONTINUED
Recall D(1/3,0) = (1 ,0) and so ˜ α(1/3,0) = ( A−I)−1(1,0) = (2 /3,−1/3). Thus o((1/3,0),˜f))
shadows that of o((2/3,−1/3), A) inR2. Similarly, since D(0,1/3) = (0 ,1),o((0,1/3),˜f)
shadows o((−1/3,2/3), A) inR2. Projecting to X⊂T2, note that (2 /3,−1/3)≡(2/3,2/3)≡
(−1/3,2/3) mod Z2and so indicating projections by primes, ((2 /3,2/3)′,ΦA), ((1 /3,0)′, f),
and ((0 ,1/3)′, f) all globally shadow. Similarly, ((1 /3,1/3)′,ΦA), ((2 /3,0)′, f), and ((0 ,2/3)′, f)
all globally shadow.
7.H1-EXPANSION AND GENERAL ORBITS
7.1.H1-EXPANSION
Since all periodic orbits of fglobally shadow a periodic orbit of Φ A, the natural next step
is to investigate general orbits. To make progress we need more control over A.
Definition 7.1. A linear transformation A:Rb→Rbis called expanding if all its eigenvalues
are outside the unit circle. A map f:M→MisH1-expanding if A=f∗is. For expanding
A, letλ=λ(A)be such that ρ(A−1)<1/λ < 1and∥ · ∥ be an adapted norm with ∥A−1∥<
1/λ(see Proposition 1.2.2 in [32]). Thus ∥A−1⃗ v∥<(1/λ)∥⃗ v∥and∥A⃗ v∥> λ∥⃗ v∥for all
⃗ v∈Rb. Accompanying Awill always be the metric on Rbcoming from the adapted norm,
˜d(x, y) =∥x−y∥.
The crucial observation in shadowing is that in the presence of expansion there is a uniform
bound on the distance between orbits that shadow. If orbits get too far away from each other,
the expansion takes over and their mutual distance goes to infinity. From another angle,
(2.5) says that on scales larger than c(f) :=∥σ∥the map flooks like Aand so is “expanding
on large scales”.
Lemma 7.2. Assume fisH1-expanding. The orbits (x, f)and(y,ΦA)globally shadow if
and only if they globally shadow with constant c(f)/(λ(A)−1) := δ(f).
Proof. Assume (˜ x,˜f) and (˜ y, A) globally shadow. Since ˜ ι˜f(˜x) =A˜ι(˜x) +σ(˜x) letting δk=
∥˜ι˜fk(˜x)−Ak˜y∥,
δk+1=∥A(˜ι˜fk(˜x)−Ak˜y) +σ(˜fk(˜x))∥ ≥λδk−c(f). (7.1)
Consider the dynamical system z7→λz−c. It has a fixed point at δ(f) and any point greater
than this fixed point iterates to infinity. Thus if some δk> δ(f), then δk→ ∞ contrary to
assumption. The converse is trivial. □
7.2. GLOBAL SHADOWING
With the expansion hypothesis the phenomenon of global shadowing holds not just for pe-
riodic orbits, but for general orbits as well. The proof is a simple variant of the standard
hyperbolic shadowing lemma.
12Lemma 7.3. Letf:M→MbeH1-expanding with λandc(f)as defined above. For
˜x0∈˜Mathere is a unique ˜y∈Rbsuch that
∥˜ι˜fi(˜x0)−Ai(˜y)∥ ≤δ(f) (7.2)
for all i∈N. Thus (x, f)globally shadows (y, ϕ A)with constant δ(f).
Proof. For each i, let ˜xi= ˜ι˜fi(˜x0) and so using (2.5), ˜ xiis ac(f)-pseudo-orbit for A. When
Bi=Bδ(xi) for z∈Bi,
˜d(z, Ax i−1)≤˜d(z, xi) +˜d(xi, A(xi−1)) = ˜d(z,˜xi) +˜d(˜ι˜f(˜xi−1), A˜xi−1)< δ(f) +c(f).(7.3)
Thus ˜d(A−1(z), xi−1)<δ(f)+c(f)
λ=δ(f) and so A−1(Bi)⊂Bi−1.
Therefore, {A−i(Bi)}is a nested family of topological balls in B0of decreasing diameter
so there is a unique point ˜ y∈ ∩A−i(Bi). Thus Ai(˜y)∈Bifor all iand so o(˜y, A) shadows
o(˜x,˜f) with constant δ.
For the uniqueness, assume that both ˜ yand ˜y′satisfy (7.2). Then ∥Ai(˜y)−Ai(˜y′)∥<2δ
which implies ˜ y= ˜y′since Ais expanding. □
7.3. THE SEMICONJUGACY
Definition 7.4. Define ˜α:˜Ma→Rbby letting ˜α(˜x)be the unique point ˜ywith o(˜x,˜f)
shadowing o(˜y, A).
Theorem 7.5. When fisH1-expanding, the map ˜α:˜Ma→Rbis continuous, equivariant
(˜α(δ⃗ n˜x) = ˜α(˜x)+⃗ n), and satisfies ˜α◦˜f=A◦˜α. It thus descends to a continuous semiconju-
gacy α:M→Tboffacting on MtoΦAacting on the compact, invariant set α(M)⊂Tb.
Further, αis homotopic to ιand thus if M=Tb,αis onto.
Proof. We first prove continuity. If ˜ xn→˜x0we must show that ˜ α(˜xn)→˜α(˜x0).
Let ˜yn= ˜α(˜xn). By Lemma 7.3, ˜d(˜ι(˜xn),˜yn)≤δ(f) for all n. Thus for sufficiently large n,
˜d(˜yn,˜ι(˜x0))<2δ. Thus passing to a subsequence if necessary, there exists a ˜ y0with ˜ yn→˜y0.
For a fixed k
˜d(˜ι˜fk(˜x0), Ak˜y0)≤˜d(˜ι˜fk(˜x0),˜ι˜fk(˜xn)) + ˜d(˜ι˜fk(˜xn), Ak˜yn) +˜d(Ak˜yn, Ak˜y0). (7.4)
Letting n→ ∞ yields ˜d(˜ι˜fk(˜x0), Ak˜y0)≤δ(f). This holds for all k, and so ˜ y0= ˜α(˜x0) as
required.
For the equivariance, note that (2.1) works for both ˜ ι˜fandAand the metric is equivariant
and so ˜d(˜ι˜fk(δ⃗ n˜x), Ak(˜α(˜x) +⃗ n) = ˜d(˜ι˜fk(˜x), Ak˜α(˜x))≤δ(f) for all k, and so α(δ⃗ n˜x) =
˜α(˜x) +⃗ nfor all ⃗ n∈Zb.
As for the commutativity, note that ˜d(˜ι˜fk(˜x), Ak˜α(˜x))≤δ(f) for all ksays that
˜d(˜ι˜fk−1(˜f(˜x)), Ak−1(A˜α(˜x))≤δ(f) (7.5)
for all k, and thus ˜ α(˜f(˜x)) = A˜α(˜x) for all ˜ x. The rest of the second sentence follows
immediately.
For the last sentence, let γ(˜x) = ˜α(˜x)−˜ι(˜x). Then inside Rb, for t∈[0,1], ˜αt(˜x) =
˜ι(˜x) + (1 −t)γ(˜x) is a homotopy from ˜ αto ˜ιthat descends to a homotopy from αtoιin
Tb. Since ιis a homeomorphism when M=TbandTbis a closed manifold, α:Tb→Tbis
onto. □
13Remark 7.6. The semiconjugacy αis usually not onto, except in the special case noted in
the theorem. It is sometimes injective, but this can be quite difficult to prove. In addition, α
is often of low regularity, for example H¨ older but nowhere locally of bounded variation. See
Sections 12 and 13 below.
7.4. CONTEXT
The notion of global shadowing is due to Katok. It is central to the proof of Handel’s
Theorem 16.2 below. The arguments and results of this section are Abelian versions of
Handel’s from [28]. J. Kwapisz pointed out to the author that the standard pseudo-orbit
shadowing argument applied to Φ Alifted to Rbwould yield a semiconjugacy equivalent to
that of Franks of the next section (Theorem 8.1). The shadowing argument used here is a
simplification of Robinson’s [37].
8.ASYMPTOTIC DISPLACEMENT I
Global shadowing provides on method of computing asymptotic displacements of general
orbits. In this section we work more directly by taking a normalized limit of the motion
after niterates.
Iterating (2.5) yields
˜ι˜fn(˜x) =An˜ι(˜x) +An−1σ(x) +···+Aσ(fn−2(x)) +σ(fn−1(x)). (8.1)
This indicates that when fisH1-expanding most orbits run off to infinity in ˜Maat the rate
of∥An∥. Normalizing by that rate yields
A−n˜ι˜fn(˜x) = ˜ι(˜x) +A−1σ(x) +A−2σ(f(x)) +···+A−n(fn−1(x)) := ˜ ι(˜x) +σk(x).(8.2)
Since Ais expanding, using the adapted metric from Definition 7.1, ∥A−kσ(fk−1(x))∥<
c(f)/λk, and so by the Weierstrass M-test, the limit as n→ ∞ converges to a continuous
function
˜β(˜x) := lim
n→∞A−n˜ι˜fn(˜x) = ˜ι(˜x) +∞X
n=1A−nσ(fn−1(x)) := ˜ ι(˜x) +σ∞(x) (8.3)
where both ∥σk(x)∥,∥σ∞(x)∥ ≤δ(f). So in a precise sense, ˜β(˜x) is measuring a normalized
asymptotic displacement of ˜ xunder ˜β. We summarize the properties of β:
Theorem 8.1 (Franks, Shub, Band) .When fisH1-expanding the map ˜β:˜Ma→Rbis
continuous and if fisL-Lipschitz, ˜βisν-H¨ older for any 0< ν < min(log( λ(A))/log(L),1).
Further, ˜βis equivariant, ˜β(˜x+⃗ n) =˜β(˜x) +⃗ n, and satisfies ˜β◦˜f=A◦˜f. It thus descends
to a continuous semiconjugacy β:M→Tboffacting on MtoΦAacting on the compact,
invariant set β(M)⊂Tb. Further, o(˜x,˜f)globally shadows o(˜y, A)if and only if ˜y=˜β(˜x)
and thus ˜β= ˜αfrom Theorem 7.5.
Proof. As already remarked, continuity of βfollows from the Weierstrass M-test. To prove
the H¨ older assertion, first note that since fis Lipschitz, then by (2.5), so is σ. Since bounded
Lipschitz functions are ν-H¨ older for any 0 < ν < 1, for some constant L′,∥σ(x)−σ(y)∥ ≤
L′∥x−y|ν. We therefore have
∥A−nσ(fn−1(x))−A−nσ(fn−1(y))∥ ≤∥σ(fn−1(x))−σ(fn−1(y))∥
λn≤L′(Ln−1∥x−y|)ν
λn
14Thus
∥σ∞(x)−σ∞(y)∥< L′
λ∞X
n=1(Lν
λ)n−1
∥x−y∥ν,
where the sum converges since by the choice of ν,Lν/λ < 1. So σ∞and thus ˜βareν-H¨ older.
Since σ(δ⃗ n˜x) =σ(˜x), equivariance follows. For the commutativity,
˜β◦˜ι˜f= lim
n→∞A−n˜ι˜fn+1= lim
n→∞A(A−(n+1)˜ι˜fn+1) =A˜β (8.4)
To prove the shadowing assertion, recall that ˜β(˜x) = ˜ι(˜x) +σ∞(x) where ∥σ∞∥ ≤δ(f).
Thus ˜d(˜β(˜x),˜ι(˜x))≤δ(f) and so
δ(f)≥˜d(˜β◦˜ι˜fn(˜x),˜ι˜fn(˜x)) = ˜d(An˜β(˜x),˜ι˜fn(˜x)) (8.5)
which is to say that o(˜β(˜x), A) shadows o(˜x,˜f). For the converse assume that o(˜y, A) shadows
o(˜x,˜f). We have just shown that o(˜β(˜x), A) shadows o(˜x,˜f). Thus ∥Ai(˜y)−Ai(˜β(˜x))∥<2δ
for all iand so ˜ y=˜β(˜x) since Ais expanding. □

8.2. CONTEXT
Franks proves Theorem 8.1 using a fixed point argument [21]. The summation formula 8.3
is basically the kthiterate of his operator acting on f. Shub uses a series in [39] and shows
the sum is H¨ older when fis Lipschitz. The equivalence of Franks map to shadowing in the
universal Abelian cover is due to Band [4]. The case of nontrivial Jordan block is covered in
[13]. See Manning [34] for some implications and amplifications of Franks Theorem.
9.ASYMPTOTIC DISPLACEMENTS II
We develop yet another natural way to compute asymptotic displacements. In this method
we take the limit of the approximate displacements for finite orbit segments. It turns out
15that this is the same as assigning a finite orbit segment a periodic point under Φ AinTband
then taking limits of these periodic points. Perhaps not surprisingly, the result agrees with
the function ˜ αand˜βof previous sections.
To approximate the orbit segments we partition ˜Mainto fundamental domains and use
them for a coarse form of symbolic dynamics. So let ˜M0be a connected fundamental domain
of˜Maunder the Zbaction by deck transformations and δ⃗ n˜M⃗ n=˜M0for⃗ n∈Zband so
˜Ma=⊔˜M⃗ n
as a disjoint union. In analogy with the situation on the real line, for ˜ x∈˜Ma, let⌊˜x⌋=⃗ n
when ˜ x∈˜M⃗ nand let {˜x}= ˜ι(˜x)− ⌊˜x⌋ ∈Rb. Thus for all ˜ x, ˜ι(˜x) =⌊˜x⌋+{˜x}with
∥{˜x}∥ ≤ diam ιM0. For each ˜ xthe approximate displacement after ksteps is
dk(˜x) =⌊˜fk(˜x)⌋ − ⌊ ˜x⌋ ∈Zb
Thus ˜ ι˜fk(˜x)≈˜ι(˜x) +dk(˜x) with an error uniformly bounded by twice the diameter of ι˜M0.
We imitate section 5.2 and normalize by ( Ak−I) yielding
Lemma 9.1. When the function fisH1-expanding,
lim
k→∞(Ak−I)−1dk(˜x) =˜β(˜x).
Proof. For all k,
dk(˜x) = ˜ι˜fk(˜x)− {˜fk(˜x)} −(˜ι(˜x)− {˜x}) = (Ak−I)˜ι(˜x) +Akσk(x) +ωk(˜x)
where ωk(˜x) =−{˜fk(˜x)}+{˜x}is bounded by 2 diam ˜ ι(M0). Thus
(Ak−I)−1dk(˜x) = ˜ι(˜x)+(Ak−I)−1Akσk(x)+(Ak−I)−1ωk(˜x)→˜ι(˜x)+σ∞(x) =˜β(˜x) (9.1)
ask→ ∞ since ( Ak−I)−1Ak= (I−A−k)−1→Isince Ais expanding. □
When ˜ xis the lift of a period kpoint then dk(˜x) = ∆ k(˜x) and ˜ y= (Ak−I)−1dk(˜x) is the
lift of a period kpoint of Φ Aand (˜ x,˜f) and (˜ y, A) shadow. This means that downstairs,
α(x) =y, so informally we are using ( y,ΦA) to approximate or model ( x, f). Thus for a
general point ˜ xafter kiterates we have that ( Ak−I)−1dk(˜x) is the lift of a period point of
ΦAthat approximates (˜ x,˜f) forkiterates. Then (9.1) takes the limit of these approximating
period points to get the probably not periodic point of Φ Awhich best approximates it. The
lemma says that this point, as expected, is α(x) =β(x).
Remark 9.2. The definition of dkdoes not use the map ˜ι. The lemma above shows that
the construction of the maps α=βdoes not depend on the choice of the one-forms in the
definition of ι.
9.1. CONTEXT
The method of just keeping track of the fundamental domain of a lifted orbit is common in
the theory of rotation sets. See, for example, Section 11 of [11].
1610. HOMEOMORPHISMS
For the sake of expositional simplicity thus far we have focused on H1-expansion, but most
of the results are true, and were first proved, for homeomorphisms with a homological hy-
perbolicity assumption.
Definition 10.1. Ifh:M→Mis a homeomorphism and (h∗)1=Ahas all it eigenvalues
off the unit circle, then his called H1-hyperbolic
It is essential that hbe a homeomorphism. Many of the results aren’t true for a non-
injective map even if the hyperbolicity hypothesis on ( h∗)1hold. For example, if Ais hyper-
bolic but not invertible over Z.
We briefly go through the previous sections and note what changes are necessary. The
material in Sections 4 and 5 just require that Ahave no eigenvalues which are roots of unity,
so they go through unchanged under H1-hyperbolicity. Since we are now working with a
homeomorphism the definition of global shadowing in Section 6 needs to be extended to
include all iterates n∈Z. For the material in Sections 7 through Section 9 the strategy is
to split the system into stable and unstable directions and use the expansion of fandf∗
in the stable directions and using the inverses, the expansion in the stable directions. This
forces several small changes, for example, the shadowing constant in Lemma 7.2 becomes
2δ(f) since both forward and backward time need to be controlled. In Theorem 8.1 when f
isH1-hyperbolic, Φ Ais a hyperbolic total automorphism, also called a linear Anosov map.
11.MIXED SPECTRUM
11.1. SINGLE EIGENVALUES
Understanding the influence of individual eigenvalues of f∗requires maps ˜Ma→R. As in
the map ˜ ι, this requires cohomology not homology. Somewhat informally, a cohomology
class represented by H1(M;R)→Ris induced by a map M→S1which lifts to ˜Ma→R
satisfying certain conditions.
So assume now that AT=f∗:H1(M;R)→H1(M;R) has a real eigenvalue µ̸= 0 with
eigenvector ⃗ v. Let Lµ:Rb→RbeLµ(˜x) =⟨⃗ v,˜x⟩. Thus Lµ(A˜x) =µLµ. Using formula 8.1
and letting ˆ σµ=Lµ◦˜σandσµits projection to the base we have
Lµ˜ι˜fn˜x=µnLµ˜ι(˜x) +µn−1σµ(x) +···+µσµ(˜fn−2(x)) +σµ(˜fn−1(x)). (11.1)
11.2. SINGLE EIGENVALUES WITH |µ|>1
11.2.1. THE SEMICONJUGACY
Assume now that the eigenvalue of AT=f∗is real with µ >1. The case of complex |µ|>1
is easily dealt with. Dividing (11.1) by µnwe have
lim
n→∞Lµ(˜ι˜fn(˜x))
µn=Lµ(˜ι(˜x)) +∞X
i=0σµ(fi(x))
µi+1. (11.2)
17This converges uniformly by the Weierstrass M-test, and let ˜βµ:˜M→Rbe the continuous
function defined by this sum. It follows directly that
˜Ma˜f− − − → ˜Ma
˜βµyy˜βµ
R×µ− − − → R
So we have obtained a semiconjugacy between ˜facting on ˜Maand multiplication by µon
R.
Theorem 11.1 (Franks, Shub) .Assume that f:M→Mis a continuous map of the smooth,
connected manifold Mandµ∈RorCis a simple eigenvalue of f∗:H1(M;Z)→H1(M;Z)
with|µ|>1. For each lift ˜f:˜Ma→˜Maoffto the universal Abelian cover ˜Ma, there exists
a unique continuous map ˜βµ:˜Ma→RorCwith
˜βµ◦˜f=µ˜βµ.
IffisL-Lipschitz, ˜βuis H¨ older with any constant 0< ν < log(|µ|)/log(L). If fis a
homeomorphism we may consider f−1, and so obtain ˜βµfor0<|µ|<1.
Remark 11.2. IfAThas a nontrivial Jordan block with eigenvalue µand generalized eigen-
basis A⃗ v1=µ⃗ v1, A⃗ v i=µ⃗ vi+⃗ vi−1fori= 2, . . . , n then one obtains a family ˜β1◦˜f=
µ˜β1,˜βi◦˜f=µ˜βi+˜βi−1fori= 2, . . . , n .
11.2.2. INDUCED STRUCTURES
The semiconjugacy corresponding to a single eigenvalue µmeasures the asymptotic motion
of orbits in the covering space ˜Main the direction of the eigenvector. It does not, in general,
descend to the base but it does, however, induce two structures that do descend to the base.
First, consider the level sets ˜Xr=˜β−1
µ(r). Since, ˜βµ◦˜f=µ˜βµ, we have ˜f(˜Xr) =˜Xµrand
so the decomposition of ˜Mainto level sets of ˜βis˜f-invariant. This decomposition descends
to af-invariant decomposition {Xr}ofM. In general the decomposition elements can be
quite wild unless fhas more structure, for example in the pseudoAnsosov maps considered
below.
Second, given a path ˜ γ: [0,1]→˜Ma, let ˜Fµ(˜γ) =˜βµ(˜γ(1))−˜βµ(˜γ(0)). The function ˜Fµ
descends to a function Fµwhich assigns numbers to paths in Min a way that is homological.
It is a path cocycle which is defined as a continuous map F:C([0,1], M)→R(C) that
is additive Fω(γ1#γ2) =F(γ1) +F(γ2) and homology invariant; γ1homologous to γ2rel
endpoints implies that F(γ1) =F(γ2).
An path cocycle is said to represent the cohomology class c, ifF([Γ]) = Lc([Γ]) for every
closed curve Γ with homology class [Γ] ∈H1(M;R) and Lc:H1(M;R)→Ris the linear
functional representing the cohomology class c. A path cocycle Fis acted on by the function
fasf∗(F)(γ) =F(f◦γ). The prototypical example of a path cocycle is the assignment
γ7→R
γωfor a closed one-form ω. A path cocycle is eigen forfiff∗(F) =µF.
From Theorem 11.1 we get:
Corollary 11.3. Assume f:M→Mis a continuous map and µis an eigenvalue |µ|>1
with eigen-class cµof the action of fon first cohomology. There exists an eigen-path cocycle
Fµwith f∗(Fµ) =µFandFµrepresents the class cµ.
18Remark 11.4. The eigen-path cocycle of the Corollary is closely related to the invariant
decomposition. Specifically, given an path cocycle F, define a relation on Mbyz1∼z2if
there exists an path γconnecting z1andz2withF(γ) = 0 . This yields an equivalence relation
onMwhose classes define a decomposition of M. For the eigen-path cocycle Fµ, this is the
same as the f-invariant decomposition {Xr}defined above.
In the smooth case, given a closed one-form ωwith f∗ω=µω, integration along paths
gives an eigen-path cycle and the kernels of the one-form are tangent to the invariant decom-
position. This is a rare occurrence. Even smooth maps will rarely have an eigen-one form,
but rather an eigen-cohomology class and so f∗ω=µω+dχfor some smooth function χ. The
collection of path cocycles “completes” the space of one-forms into a space of objects with
lesser regularity where the action of fon the completion always has an actual eigen-object,
not just an eigen-equivalence class.
11.3. SINGLE EIGENVALUES µ= 1
IfAThas an eigenvalue of µ= 1 then (11.1) becomes
Lµ˜ι˜fn˜x=Lµ˜ι(˜x) +σµ(x) +···+σµ(˜fn−2)(x) +σµ(˜fn−1(x)). (11.3)
Since σµis uniformly bounded, Lµ˜ι˜fn˜xgrows at most linearly. Letting ∆µ(˜x) =Lµ(˜f(˜ι(˜x)))−
Lµ(˜ι(˜x)) we have as in Section 3 that ∆µ(˜x) = ˜σµ(˜x) and that ∆µis independent of the choice
of lift of x. Thus we treat ∆µ(x) =σµ(x) as a function on M. Again as in Section 3 it is
natural to take the Birkhoff average and define the rotation vector in the eigen-direction as
ρµ(x) = lim
n→∞1
nn−1X
i=0∆µ(fi(x)) = lim
n→∞Lµ˜ι˜fn(˜x)−Lµ˜ι(˜x)
n. (11.4)
This limit exists at almost every point of an invariant measure by Birkhoff’s Pointwise
Ergodic Theorem and measures the asymptotic linear speed in the eigen-direction.
11.4. ADDITIONAL CASES
The simplest case of mixed spectrum is when all the eigenvalues of ATare either one or
else off the unit circle. Then one can use the methods above to compute rotation vectors or
semiconjugacies in the appropriate directions.
In Remark 11.2 we discussed the results when |µ|>1 has a nontrivial Jordan block. When
µ= 1 we get a ρµin the direction of ⃗ v1with AT⃗ v1=⃗ v1. For other vectors in the generalized
eigenbasis, there doesn’t seem to be much structure to exploit using the methods here.
IfAThas eigenvalues that are roots of unity for some k, they become eigenvalues of one
for (fk)∗= (AT)kand we can compute rotation vectors in those directions for fk.
Since ATis the matrix of the action of fonH1, its characteristic polynomial is monic with
integer coefficients. Thus a classic theorem of Kronecker says that if all the eigenvalues are
on the unit circle they are roots of unity. But it can happen that AThas eigenvalues on the
unit circle which are not roots of unity. Borrowing a remark from [10], if the characteristic
polynomial is Salem by definition it is irreducible and has one eigenvalue inside, another
outside and the rest on the unit circle. Since the polynomial is irreducible the roots on
the circle can’t be roots of unity. In the theory we develop here, it is not clear how these
eigenvalues on the circle can be utilized ( cf.[23]).
19A final case where the theory here fails is for eigenvalues inside the unit circle when fis
not a homeomorphism.
11.5. EXAMPLES
As a first example, say f:T2→T2acts on H1with repeated one as an eigenvalue and a
nontrivial Jordan block (or shear)
A=
1 1
0 1
. (11.5)
Then AThas eigenvector ⃗ v= [0 1]Tand so we can compute rotation vectors of lifts in the
vertical direction in ˜Ma=R2, but in the horizontal direction in the absence of expansion or
contraction there is nothing to exploit.
As a second example, let Dnbe the closed two-dimensional disk with ninterior open
disks removed. We assume that f:Dn→Dnis a homeomorphism that keeps the outer
boundary fixed. If ffixes all the disks then A=Iand we can defined a n-dimensional
rotation vector. Each dimension measures the asymptotic rate of rotation or linking about
one of the removed disks. In general, fwill permute the disks in which case AThas a single
eigenvalue of one with eigenvector ⃗ v= [11 . . .1]T. Thus there is a single dimension of rotation
vector which measures the asymptotic linking of an orbit around all the disks. It is usual in
this situation to use ⃗ vto create a Z-covering space to which all flift. Specifically, letting
L⃗ v:H1(Dn;Z)→Zbe given by L⃗ v(⃗ w) =⟨⃗ v, ⃗ w⟩and let p:˜Dn→Dnbe the corresponding
Z-cover (it has p∗(H1(˜Dn;Z)) = ker L⃗ v). The one-dimensional rotation vector then measures
the speed of orbits moving up and down in this cover.
11.6. CONTEXT
Fathi develops path cocycles and connects them to a proper cohomology theory [19]. Shub
does Franks’ semiconjugacy for individual eigen-values using Alexander cocycles and uses
them to define the invariant decomposition [39]. The contents of this section are mainly
taken from [13]. A fair number of authors have considered the one-dimensional rotation set
in the shear isotopy class of the first example [15, 14, 36, 1, 2]. The second example is the
context for the Burau representation in which one records the action of the map on the
Z-cover using homology with Z[t, t−1] coefficients with tthe deck transformation (see, eg.
[5]).
12. REGULARITY
The resemblance of (11.2) to the definition of a Weierstrass nowhere differential function is
a hint that the semiconjugacies βandβµwill, in general, have low regularity. This is also
expected from “Conservation of Difficulty”: their existence is quite general and follows from
simple, robust hypothesis on the action on H1and the proof is just one or two lines, so there
has to be a catch somewhere.
The general heuristic is that the semiconjugacies often go from a system of higher entropy
to lower entropy. In practise this means from more stretching to less stretching. Thus the
semiconjugacy must fold. In the cases studied, the image dynamics is transitive and so the
folds must take place on a dense set so one expects βin these cases to not be locally of
bounded variation or differentiable.
2012.1. THE CIRCLE
The theory on the circle is simplified by using the monotone-light decomposition of the
semiconjugacy. A theorem by Eilenberg and by Whyburn says that if f:X→Xis a
continuous function of a compact metric space then there is a space Yand continuous maps
m:X→Yandℓ:Y→Xwith mmonotone (point preimages are connected) and mlight
(point preimages are completely disconnected) and f=ℓ◦m. In the case X=S1connected
components of point preimages are intervals and so the intermediate space Yis also the
circle.
Iff:S1→S1has degree d >1 and so f∗=d, by Theorem 8.1 there is a semiconjugacy
β:S1→S1between fand the map d:θ7→dθ. Since we are on the circle the semiconjugacy
descends to a light semiconjugacy on the intermediate space, also the circle. Thus we lose
very little information by assuming that the given degree dcircle map is light semiconjugated
tod. In this case one can prove:
Theorem 12.1. Assume fis a continuous, degree- dcircle map with a light semiconjugacy
β. The following are equivalent:
(a)The map ˜fis not injective,
(b)The map βis not injective,
(c)There exists a full measure, dense, Gδ-setΛ⊂S1so that θ∈Λimplies that β−1(θ)
is completely disconnected and uncountable and thus contains a Cantor set.
(d)The topological entropy of fsatisfies htop(f)>log(d),
(e)For all nontrivial intervals J⊂S1, the map β|Jis not of bounded variation.
12.2. PSEUDO ANOSOV MAPS
For this section we restrict to compact surfaces. A measured foliation FonMis a one-
dimensional foliation with a finite number of well-behaved singularities called prongs and a
holonomy invariant measure on transverse arcs. A homeomorphism ϕ:M→Mis pseu-
doAnosov if there are a pair of transverse measured foliations Fu,Fsand a number λ >1,
called the dilatation, so that ϕ(Fs) =1
λFsandϕ(Fu) =λFu. This means that arcs in the
stable foliation Fsare contracted by 1 /λand arcs in the unstable foliation Fuare expanded
byλ.
Assume now that ϕis a pseudoAnosov and the action AT=ϕ∗onH1has an unstable
eigenvalue µ >1. Let Fµbe the eigen-arc-cocycle give by Corollary 11.3. If γis an arc wholly
contained in a leaf of the stable invariant foliation then on hand, diam( ϕn(γ))→0 asn→ ∞
on the other, if Fµ(γ)̸= 0,|Fµ(fn(γ))|=|µnFµ(γ)| → ∞ . Thus of necessity Fµ(γ) = 0 and
so using Remark 11.4, each decomposition element Xris composed of the union of leaves of
the stable foliation. That remark also implies that Fµis holonomy invariant: if γis slid to
γ′keeping the endpoints on the same leaf, Fµ(γ) =Fµ(γ′).
What kind of transverse structure does Fµdefine? As a representative of an arc transverse
to the stable foliation, parameterize a segment of unstable leaf by its arc length sand let
H(s) =Fµ([0, s]) (His like a cumulative distribution function). Now ϕstretches arclength
byλand since ϕ∗Fµ=µFµ, the image of Hgets stretched by µ. Thus
H(λs) =µH(s), (12.1)
Since every leaf in dense, this local scaling of Hhas to happen at a dense set of points s.
21If|µ|< λ, the everywhere local scaling given by (12.1) can only happen if Hfolds up
everywhere . With some work this implies that while Hisν=log(|µ|)
log(λ)-H¨ older, it is not H¨ older
for any larger ν, is nowhere differentiable, nowhere locally of bounded variation, and nowhere
locally injective. This in turn implies that Fµcannot be extended from lengths of arcs to a
measure.
However, since Hisν:=log(|µ|)
log(λ)-H¨ older, one can make sense of
Φ(σ) =Z
σ dH,
when σisν1-H¨ older with ν1>1−ν. Thus Fµcan be used to define a holonomy invariant
H¨ older distribution on transverse arcs to the stable foliation. When µ=λ, the function H
is monotone and Φ is then a linear functional on continuous functions on transverse arcs, so
it is just the unique, holonomy invariant transverse measure to the foliation.
Theorem 12.2. Assume ϕis a pseudoAnosov homeomorphism on the surface Mwith ϕ∗
the action on H1(M;Z).
•For each unstable eigenvalue µofϕ∗there exists an eigen-path cocycle Fµwhich is
holonomy invariant to the stable foliation Fs.
•Fµcan be used to define a transverse, holonomy invariant H¨ older distribution on Fs.
•This distribution is a measure if and only if µ=λ, the dilation, (which can only
happen when ϕhas oriented foliations).
Similar results hold for each stable eigenvalue of ϕ∗and the unstable foliation, Fu.
12.3. EXAMPLE
LetMbe the genus two closed surface and ψ:M→Mis a pseudoAnosov map with
characteristic polynomial of ψ∗acting on H1(M;Z) which splits over the integers into a
pair of irreducible quadratic factors with roots 0 < λ−1< µ−1<1< µ < λ (recall that
ψ∗is symplectic). The eigenvalues/vectors yield four semi-conjugacies ˜βλ,˜βλ−1,˜βµ,and
˜βµ−1. Fathi (1988) shows that the Franks semiconjugacy into T4splits and descends into
paired maps β1:= (βλ, βλ−1) and β2:= (βµ, βµ−1), each a semiconjugacy onto a linear,
two-dimensional toral automorphism.
The semiconjugacy β1is a branched cover by [20] and so is locally a diffeomorphism at
all but finitely many points and point inverses are finite sets. On the other hand, using the
results above the semiconjugacy β2is H¨ older exponent ν= log( µ)/log(λ), but no larger ν.
It is nowhere differentiable and nowhere locally injective or B.V. Typical point inverses are
Cantor sets.
12.4. CONTEXT
The circle results are from [12] and the rest of the section from [13]. For an introduction to
pseudoAnosov maps see [40, 18, 17]. Fathi give a lower bound for the capacity of image of
the semiconjugacy described in the next section [19].
13.HIRSCH ’S PROBLEM AND FATHI’S PROGRAM
In 1970 Hirsch initiated the investigation into what kind of compact sets can be invariant
under a hyperbolic linear toral automorphism, i.e. a linear Anosov map. There is a good
22amount of literature around the problem and a nice summary is contained in [19]. In short,
if the invariant set is not a subtori, it must be fractal in various precise senses, for example,
contain no rectifiable arcs [33]. One of the question left open is whether the invariant set
can be a non-toral “very crinkled” submanifold?
In [19] Fathi gave a strategy for attacking this question. In its simplest version one starts
with a pseudoAnosov map ϕon a closed surface Σ of genus g >1 which is H1-hyperbolic. By
Franks Theorem 8.1, there is a map β: Σ→T2gwhose image is invariant under the action
of Φ Awhere A=ϕ∗on first on homology. The question then reduces to the injectivity of β.
To put this question into the context of this paper we give a general definition which will
also be used later in the paper.
Definition 13.1. Letf:M→Mand ˜Mbe a covering space to which flifts. Say that fis
˜M-expanding if there is an equivariant metric ˜don˜Mwhich induces the manifold topology
and a constant λ >1with ˜d(˜f(˜x),˜f(˜y))≥λ˜d(˜x,˜y)for all ˜x,˜y∈˜M.
Note that since the metric is equivariant, the definitions are independent of the choice of
lift of the function. For example, if Ais an expanding matrix then the toral endomorphism
ΦA:Tb→Tbwill be expanding in both the universal cover and the universal Abelian cover
(these are the same). PseudoAnosov homemorphisms are always hyperbolic in the universal
cover (see section 16 below). The question of whether pseudoAnosov homeomorphisms are
ever hyperbolic in the universal Abelian cover, i.e. are ˜Ma-hyperbolic, turns out to be the
main issue in Fathi’s program.
In general, when fisH1-expanding the next proposition says that the injectivity of the
semiconjugacy βis equivalent to fbeing expanding in the universal Abelian cover, i.e. being
˜Ma-expanding. Equation 2.5 says that H1-expansion implies large scale or coarse expansion
in˜Ma. The injectivity of βrequires more, namely, metric expansion in ˜Maat all scales.
Proposition 13.2. Assume fisH1-expanding. The following are equivalent
(a)The semiconjugacy β:M→Tbis injective.
(b)fis˜Ma-expanding
(c)If˜d(˜fi(˜x),˜fi(˜x′))< K for some Kand all i, then ˜x= ˜x′, or informally, no two
points of ˜Mashadow under ˜f.
An analogous result is true for H1-hyperbolic homeomorphisms (see Remark 16.3).
Proof. After observing that ˜β= ˜ι+σ∞with σ∞bounded implies that ˜d(˜fi(˜x),˜fi(˜x′))→ ∞
if and only if ∥˜ι˜fi(˜x),˜ι˜fi(˜x′)∥ → ∞ , the equivalence of (a) and (c) follows from Theorem 8.1.
Condition (b) easily implies condition (c). We know βis continuous and so assuming (a)
it is a homeomorphism onto its image since Mis compact. Thus ˜βis a homeomorphism
and it is easy to check that ˜d(˜x,˜y) =∥˜β(˜x)−˜β(˜y)∥is the required metric with λas in
Definition 7.1. □
13.1. EXAMPLE 2CONTINUED AND EXAMPLE 3
The map ϕ2:X→Xfrom Example 4.2 is ˜Xu-expanding as will be shown in Example 15.3
below. However, in Example 6.3 it was shown that there are pairs of points that globally
shadow in ˜Xaand so the semiconjgacy into T2is not injective, as is seen in Figure 3(left).
As an example of a ˜Xa-expanding map on X, letψ3be generated by a7→aaabaaa, b 7→
bbbabbb andϕ3:X→Xbe the tight map on a wedge of circles. Using Lemma 7.2, since
23c(ϕ3)<1 and Ain this case has eigenvalues 5 and 7, pairs of points in ˜Xacan only globally
shadow and thus have the same βimage only if they globally shadow with constant ≤1/4.
Thus it suffices to check pairs of points within 1 /4 of points on a chosen fundamental domain.
This is easily done showing that βis injective. See Figure 3(right). One can also show directly
by checking cases that ϕ3is˜Xa-expanding.
13.2. CONTEXT
Fathi [19] showed that βis injective in neighborhoods on non-singular points of the invariant
foliations. Barge and Kwapisz [6] showed βis injective on an open, full measure set in Σ.
There are two cases in which βhas been shown to be not injective: when the pseudoAnosov
map has just one singularity (Band [4]) and when the surface is genus two and the invariant
foliations are orientable (Bouwman and Kwapisz [8]).
14.THEBOWEN -FRANKS GROUP AND THE SUSPENSION FLOW
We have thus far encountered the Bowen-Franks group BF 1(A) =Zb/(A−I)Zbas the
collection of all possible displacements of fixed points of an f:M→Mwith A=f∗:
H1(M)→H1(M) as well as the group of fixed points of the linear toral endomorphism Φ A.
The maps α=βsend a fixed point of fwith given displacement to the fixed point of Φ A
with the same displacement. There are at least three others situations in which BF 1(A)
arises.
Recall that given f:M→Mits mapping torus is Tf= (M×[0,1])/∼with ( x,1)∼
(f(x),0). Its first homology is H1(Tf;Z) = BF 1(A)⊕Z. The suspension flow φf
tonTfis
the projection of of the vertical flow on M×[0,1] to Tf. Periodic points of fcorrespond
to closed orbits of φf
t. The Zcomponent of H1(Tf) keeps track of the period. For a fixed
point, the first component is the displacement of the fixed point.
Lemma 14.1. Two fixed points x, x′∈Fix(f)have D(x, f) =D(x′, f)inBF1(A)if and
only if the corresponding closed orbits of φf
tare homologous in Tf.
Recalling from Section 5.3 that for a toral endomorphism, all the displacement classes are
full. Thus for its suspension flow every homology class with second coordinate equal to one
contains a closed orbit that goes once around, i.e. corresponds to a fixed point. When fis
H1- expanding or hyperbolic the semiconjuagcy β:M→Tbinduces a map β′:Tf→TΦA
with the semi-flow on Tfpushed to one on β′(Tf) making it an invariant set of φΦA
t. A
closed orbit that goes once around under φf
tis thus pushed to one of φΦA
tand thus shares
its homology class. Therefore the semiconjugacies can be viewed as picking out a subset of
the homology classes in TΦA.
Similar considerations of course hold for points in Fix( fk) using the mapping torus Tfk
offk. A natural question is how the higher period orbits lie in Tf, the mapping torus of
fitself. Are they distinguished by homology? In general, no, since H1(Mf) can be quite
“small’. As a simple example, consider the doubling map d:S1→S1viad(θ) = 2 θ. In
this case H1(Md) =Zand thus homology only sees the period. But the number of periodic
points of period kgrows exponentially and they are all in different displacement classes since
every lift of dkhas exactly one fixed point. The situation for periodic orbits and homotopy
inTfis quite different; π1(Tf) does distinguish different Nielsen classes, see Section 16.2.
24The group BF 1(A) also arises as the deck group of the largest cover to which flifts and
commutes with all deck transformations [25]. Thus in this cover, every lift of xis fixed by
the same deck transformation, namely, D(x, f)∈BF1(A). Finally, as it originally appeared,
BF1(A) is an invariant for flow equivalence of the subshift of finite type with transition
matrix A.
14.1. EXAMPLE
For a fixed Athe collection of groups BF k(A) are somewhat mysterious (to the author at
least) and it is not clear how the algebra connects to the dynamics in a meaningful way. For
the matrix A2from Example 4.2 the family is very regular,
BFk(A2)∼=Z2k−1⊕Z4k−1.
But other examples are more complicated, for example, for
A4=
2 1
1 1
BF2(A4) =Z5,BF3(A4) =Z4⊕Z4,BF4(A4) =Z3⊕Z15,BF5(A4) =Z11⊕Z11, . . ..
14.2. CONTEXT
The papers of Bowen and Franks [9, 22] were mainly about BF 1(A)’s role as a flow equivalence
invariant when Ais the transition matrix for a subshift of finite type. However, it is clear
from the papers that they also knew the connection of their group to the homology of a
mapping torus and to the periodic points of the toral endomorphism Φ A.
15.HOMOTOPY AND PERSISTENCE (NIELSEN THEORY )
Thus far we have used first homology to measure the progress of orbits and have therefore
been focusing on displacements in the universal Abelian cover ˜Ma. In this section we measure
progress of orbits using the fundamental group and therefore work with displacements in the
universal cover ˜Mu. These considerations belong to Nielsen Theory. Most expositions follow
the history and develop Nielsen Theory first and the contents of the paper thus far are
considered later as the Abelianization.
For simplicity of exposition, assume fhas a fixed point x0which we use as the basepoint
for the fundamental group. We write π=π1(M;x0) and let f#:π→πbe the induced
map. Fix an identification of πwith the deck group of ˜Mu. If˜f:˜Mu→˜Muis a lift of a
continuous f:M→Mthen
˜f(δ˜x) =f#(δ)˜f(˜x) (15.1)
for all δ∈π1.
15.1. FIXED POINTS
Forx∈Fix(f) with a lift ˜ x, and a fixed lift ˜f, if˜f(˜x) =δ˜xthen the ˜Mu-translation is
∆u(˜x,˜f) =δ. Note that if we choose a different lift of ˜ x, namely γ˜xthen
˜f(γ˜x) =f#(γ)˜f(˜x) =f#(γ)δ˜x=f#(γ)δγ−1(γ˜x)
25which is to say that ∆ u(γ˜x) =f#(γ)∆u(˜x)γ−1. Thus to get a well defined displacement we
define for x∈M
Du(x,˜f) ={f#(γ)∆u(˜x)γ−1:γ∈π1and ˜xis any lift of x}.
In Nielsen Theory the ˜Mu-displacement is called the twisted conjugacy orReidemeister co-
ordinate .
As with the ˜Ma-displacement in Lemma 4.1, there are three equivalent ways of looking at
˜Mu-displacement.
Lemma 15.1. Assume x, y∈Fix(f)The following are equivalent
•Du(x,˜f) =Du(y,˜f)for some lift ˜f.
•There exists an arc γconnecting xtoywith f◦γhomotopic to γrel endpoints.
•There exist lifts ˜x,˜y,˜fto˜Muwith ˜f(˜x) = ˜xand ˜f(˜y) = ˜y.
The collection of fixed points of fthat have the same ˜Mu-displacement is called the ˜Mu-
displacement class or the Nielsen class ofx. We adapt the latter classical terminology here.
The Nielsen class of x∈Fix(x) is then NC( x) ={y∈Fix(f) :Du(x,˜f) =Du(y,˜f)}. A
fundamental fact is that Nielsen classes of fixed points are open in Fix( f) and compact. This
allows one to define the fixed point index of a Nielsen Class. It also implies that for a given
fthe number of (non-empty) Nielsen classes is finite. A Nielsen class is called essential if it
has nonzero fixed point index.
Central to the theory of persistence of fixed points is the correspondence of Nielsen classes
of homotopic maps.
Theorem 15.2. Assume f0is homotopic to f1via a homotopy ftandx0∈Fix(f0)and
x1∈Fix(f1). The following are equivalent
•Du(x,˜f) =Du(y,˜g)where ˜fand˜gare equivariantly homotopic.
•There exists an arc γconnecting xtoywith ft◦γhomotopic to γrel endpoints.
•There exist lifts ˜x,˜y,˜f,˜gto˜Muwith ˜fand˜gequivariantly homotopic and ˜f(˜x) = ˜x
and˜g(˜y) = ˜y.
If any of these conditions hold we say that xandycorrespond under the homotopy . Note
that if x′andy′are in the same Nielsen classes as xandy, respectively, then x′andy′also
correspond under the homotopy. Thus it makes sense to say that NC( x, f) and NC( y, g)
correspond under the homotopy. The fundamental theorem of Nielsen theory is
Theorem 15.3. Assume that x∈Fix(f)has an essential Nielsen class. If gis homotopic
tofthere exists a y∈Fix(g)withyconnected to xby the homotopy. Further, the fixed point
indices of NC(x, f)andNC(y, g)are equal.
15.2. PERIODIC POINTS
We say that xis a period kpoint for fiffk(x) =xand this is the least k >0 with this
property. This is obviously stronger than just x∈Fix(fk). The complication for persistence
of periodic points under homotopy is that a period kpoint could have period mpoints with
m < k which are Nielsen equivalent under fk. This is an issue because we would like the
period kpoint to persist as a period kpoint. In the language of bifurcation theory we
need hypothesis on the Nielsen class of a period point which disallows its members from
undergoing a period dividing bifurcation under a homotopy.
26Let us first define displacements of period points. Fix a lift ˜f(k)offkand assume x∈
Fix(fk). If ˜f(k)(˜x) =δ˜xsay ∆ u(˜x,˜f(k)) =δand then for x∈M,
Du(x,˜f(k)) ={fk
#(γ)δγ−1:γ∈π1}.
A period korbit is collapsible if its displacement looks like the displacement under ˜fkof a
periodic point of lesser period. This leads to the following definition.
Definition 15.4. A period kpoint for fis called collapsible (or irreducible) if there are
ℓ >1, m≥1with ℓm=kand an element σ∈π1with
f(l−1)m
# (σ)f(l−2)m
# (σ). . . fm
#(σ)σ∈Du(x,˜f(k))
Ifxis not collapsible, then xand its Nielsen class are called uncollapsible.
Theorem 15.5. Assume that xis period kandNC(x, fk)is essential and uncollapsible.
Ifgis homotopic to fthere exists a period kpoint yunder gwith yconnected to xby the
homotopy. Further, the fixed point indices of NC(x, fk)andNC(y, gk)are equal.
In light of this theorem, a period kpoint and it Nielsen class are called persistent if it is
essential and uncollapsible. Thus the displacement of any persistent point will be present in
any homotopic map.
In general, it is hard to check from the algebra if a given periodic point is uncollapsible.
There is a sufficient condition which combined with Theorem 15.5 gives a simple condition
for persistence of period korbits.
Lemma 15.6. If for some k, every point in Fix(fk)is in a different Nielsen class under fk,
then every period kpoint of fis uncollapsible. Thus if every lift of fkto˜Muhas at most
one fixed point, then every period kpoint with nonzero index is persistent.
Proof. We first prove the contrapositive of the first sentence. Thus for some x,ℓ, m≥1 with
mℓ=k, we have
˜fℓm(˜x) =f(l−1)m
# (σ)f(l−2)m
# (σ). . . fm
#(σ)σ˜x. (15.2)
This implies
˜fℓm(˜fm(˜x)) = ˜fm(˜fℓm(˜x)) =fℓm
#(σ)f(l−1)m
# (σ). . . fm
#(σ)˜fm(˜x). (15.3)
On the other hand, (15.2) implies
˜fℓm(σ˜x) =fℓm
#(σ)˜fℓm˜x=fℓm
#(σ)f(l−1)m
# (σ). . . fm
#(σ) (σ˜x). (15.4)
Thus the same lift of fkfixes both ˜fm(˜x) and σ˜x. There are two alternatives. If ˜fm(˜x) =σ˜x,
then xhas period ≤m < k , a contradiction to the assumption that xhas least period k.
The other alternative is that some lift of fkfixes two points, proving the contrapositive.
For the second sentence, since every lift can fix at most one point, by Theorem15.2, no
two period kpoints are Nielsen equivalent under fkand so each periodic Nielsen class has
at most one point. If that point has nonzero index, by Theorem 15.5 it is persistent, □
The expansivity condition used in the universal cover introduced in Definition 13.1 allows
us to invoke Lemma 15.6.
Theorem 15.7. Iffis˜Mu-expanding then for all k, all the points in Fix(fk)are in different
Nielsen classes. Thus if they have non-zero index, they are persistent.
2715.3. EXAMPLES
To examine the examples ϕ1, ϕ2andϕ3note that they all satisfy the following property:
there is a integer M > 1 so that for any nontrivial word w,ℓ(ψ(w)) = Mℓ(w) where ℓ
is the reduced word length. It follows then that their tight maps made on the wedge of
circles are ˜Mu-expanding. When Mis a compact, connected Riemannian manifold then
anyf:M→Mthat is ˜Mu-expanding is expanding under Gromov’s definition and thus is
topologically conjugate to a infra-nil-endomorphism [27].
15.4. CONTEXT
Lemma 15.6 is inspired by a lemma from Asimov-Franks [3]. For excellent expositions of
Nielsen theory see the works of Jiang, for example, [29, 31].
16. GLOBAL PERSISTENCE
It turns out that in many homotopy classes there is a “minimal model” in the sense that
every map in its class has at least its dynamics.
Definition 16.1. Iffis˜Mu-expanding and in addition all periodic orbits have nonzero index
and the set of its periodic points is dense, then fis called a minimal model in its homotopy
class.
The terminology minimal model is justified by the following theorem:
Theorem 16.2 (Handel) .Assume ϕ:M→Mis a minimal model and gis homotopic to
ϕ. Then there exists a compact, g-invariant set Yand a continuous, onto map ω:Y→M
which is homotopic to the inclusion so that
Yg|Y− − − → Y
ωyyω
Mϕ− − − → M
Sketch. Fix equivariantly homotopic lifts ˜ gand ˜ϕto the universal cover. Recall that two
orbits (˜ x,˜ϕ) and (˜ y,˜g)˜Mu-shadow if there is some Kwith ˜d(˜ϕn(˜x),˜gn(˜y))< K for all n
where ˜dis some equivariant metric on ˜Muwhich induces the manifold topology.
Let
˜Y={˜y∈˜Mu: there exists a (˜ x,˜ϕ) that ˜Mu-shadows(˜ y,˜g)}
and define ˜ ω:˜Y→˜Muby sending ˜ yto the ˜ xit˜Mu-shadows. Note that because of the
expansion no two points can ˜Mu-shadow under ˜ϕ, so this point ˜ xis unique and so ˜ ωis
well-defined. Clearly ˜ ω◦˜g|˜Y=˜ϕ◦˜ωand ˜ω◦δ=δ◦˜ωfor each deck transformation δand so
˜ωdescends to semi-conjugacy ωonY, the projection of ˜Y.
The crucial uniformity comes from the analog of Theorem 7.2, namely, that (˜ x,˜ϕ) and (˜ y,˜g)
˜Mu-shadow with some constant Kif and only if they ˜Mu-shadow with constant c/(λ−1)
where c= max {˜d(˜ϕ(˜x),˜g(˜x)) : ˜x∈˜Mu}. Note that cis finite since ˜ gis equivariantly
homotopic to ˜ϕ. With a little work this uniform bound implies that ˜Yis closed and ˜ ωis
continuous.
28The final step uses the persistence of period points. For every periodic point xofϕ
by Theorem 15.7, there is a periodic point yofgthat is Nielsen equivalent to it. As in
Lemma 6.2 this implies that they have lifts that ˜Mu-shadow. Thus the image of the compact
setYcontains all the periodic point of ϕ. But this set is dense and so ω(Y) =M. □
Remark 16.3. A homeomorphism his called ˜Mu-hyperbolic if there a pair of an equivariant
pseudo-metrics ˜d1,˜d2with ˜d=q
˜d2
1+˜d2
2a metric inducing the manifold topology and a
constant λ > 1so that ˜d1(˜h(˜x),˜h(˜y))≥λ˜d1(˜x,˜y)and ˜d2(˜h−1(˜x),˜h−1(˜y))≥λ˜d2(˜x,˜y). A
homeomorphism is called a minimal model if it is ˜Mu-hyperbolic with dense periodic points
all essential. Theorem 16.2 is also true in this case.
16.1. EXAMPLES
IfAis expanding then Φ A:Tb→Tbis a minimal model. Thus if f:Tb→Tbis homotopic
to Φ A, or equivalently f∗=A, then Theorem 16.2 applies yielding a semiconjugacy from f
acting on a subset of Tbonto Φ Aacting on Tb. On the other hand, fisH1-expanding and
so Theorem 8.1 applies yielding a semiconjugacy from facting on all of TbintoTb. We have
seen that both semiconjugacies are equivalent to shadowing and for M=Tb,˜Ma=˜Mu=Rb
we see that the two semiconjugacies are the same and for the torus the semiconjugacy βis
TbontoTb.
As noted in Example 15.3, the maps ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3are all ˜Muexpanding. Since they each
have dense essential periodic points they are minimal models in their homotopy classes and
so Theorem 16.2 applies to them all. One useful consequence holds for the map ϕ1which
acts as the identity on homology and thus had a rotation set as shown in Figure 2. If gis
homotopic to ϕ1then ρ(ϕ1)⊂ρ(g). This follows since ˜Mu-shadowing implies ˜Ma-shadowing
and thus the orbits have the same rotation vector.
16.2. MAPPING TORUS AND SUSPENSION FLOW
In contrast to homology, π1(Tf) is “big enough” to distinguish different Nielsen classes of not
just fixed points but periodic points as well. There is one point which requires attention: two
points on same period korbit can certainly be in different Nielsen classes under fk, but their
corresponding orbits in the suspension are the same and thus obviously freely homotopic.
So the proper condition involves the orbits of the Nielsen class.
Theorem 16.4 (Jiang) .Two period kpoints satisfy NC(x, fk) = NC( fi(y), fk)for some
i= 0, . . . , k −1if and only if the corresponding closed curves are freely homotopic in Tf.
16.3. EXAMPLE
Returning to the example of d:S1→S1viad(θ) = 2 θ, recall from section 14 that H1(Td)
is just Zand records just periods of periodic points. In contrast, the mapping torus satisfies
π1(Td) =⟨z, g:z−1gz=g2⟩. This is one of the simpler of the well-studied Baumslag-Solitar
groups, namely BS(1,2) [7]. It has a normal subgroup Nisomorphic to the group of 2-adic
integers with BS(1,2)/N∼Z. It would be interesting to connect the twisted conjugacy
classes of periodic points of dwith the algebraic structure of BS(1,2).
Remark 16.5. In[11]the condition in Jiang’s theorem is incorrectly stated as NC(x, fk) =
NC(y, fk)rather than NC(x, fk) = NC( fi(y), fk). The statement about the relation of strong
Nielsen equivalence to isotopy in the suspension flow needs to be similarly amended. The
29statement there about Abelian Nielsen equivalence and being homologous in the suspension is
completely wrong as the example in Section 14 shows.
16.4. CONTEXT
Handel’s Theorem 16.2 was originally proved for pseudoAnosov homeomorphisms. The proof
given above for Theorem 16.2 is a sketch of Handel’s proof in [28]. Jiang’s Theorem 16.4 is
proved in [30]. The ˜Mu-displacements of periodic points in the examples on the wedge of
two circles can be computed using the methods of Fadell and Husseini [16], see also [31].
17.APPENDIX
The numerical algorithm for producing the figures of the image of ˜βfor the examples is based
on two facts. The first is that ˜ϕ(⃗0) =⃗0, implies using (2.5) that ˜ϕk(⃗ n) =Ak⃗ nfor all ⃗ n∈Z2.
Thus if ˜ z∈˜Xis such that ˜ϕj(˜z) =⃗ n, then ˜ϕj+i(˜z) =Ai⃗ nand so A−(j+i)˜ϕj+i(˜z) =A−j⃗ nfor
alli. Thus ˜β(˜z) =A−j⃗ n. This tells us that an approximation A−k˜ϕkfor finite kwill be an
accurate computation of ˜β(˜z) for any ˜ zwith ˜ϕj(˜z)∈Z2for a j≤k.
The second fact concerns how to compute the ˜ zthat eventually land on the lattice under ˜ϕ.
LetIa= [0,1]×{0}andIb={0}×[0,1] and so W0=Ia∪Ibis a fundamental domain of ˜Xa
(with two extra points). Thus Wk:=A−k˜ϕk(Ia)∪A−k˜ϕk(Ib) is an approximation of ˜β(Ia∪Ib).
An approximation of ˜β(˜X) is obtained by hitting Wkwith all the deck transformations from
Zk. By the previous paragraph, Wkwill be accurate, i.e. be in β(˜x), at those points ˜ z∈W0
for which ˜ϕj(˜z)∈Z2forj≤k.
To be specific we restrict now to Example 4.2 and drop subscripts and so ψ=ψ2and
ϕ=ϕ2. Since ˜ϕis linear with an expansion of 4 on pieces of IaandIb, it is clear that the
points ˜ z∈W0for which ˜ϕj(˜z)∈Z2forj≤kare exactly
˜zi= (i
4k,0)∈Iaand ˜z′
i= (0,i
4k)∈Ib,
for 0≤i≤4k. The value of ˜ϕkat these points can be computed from the words ψk(a) and
ψk(b). Specifically, in R2letting κ(a) =A−k((1,0)T) and κ(b) =A−k((0,1)T) we have
˜β(˜zi) =A−k˜ϕk(˜zi) =iX
ℓ=1κ(ψk(a)ℓ) and ˜β(˜z′
i) =A−k˜ϕk(˜z′
i) =iX
ℓ=1κ(ψk(b)ℓ)
Now ψ2(a) =aaabaa . . . and so ϕ2(5/42,0) = (1 ,0) + (1 ,0) + (1 ,0) + (0 ,1) + (1 ,0) = (3 ,1).
Thus
A−2ϕ2(5/42,0) = κ(a) +κ(a) +κ(a) +κ(b) +κ(a) =5X
ℓ=1κ(ψ2(a)ℓ) = (3 /8,−1/8).
Thus using the result of the first paragraph, ˜β(5/42,0) = (3 /8,−1/8).
Once the images under ˜βof the points ˜ ziand ˜z′
ihave been computed, they are plotted
with line segments drawn between consecutive images. The resulting image is then accurate
at “corners” but only an approximation elsewhere.
There is a conspicuous inaccuracy visible in Figure 3 (left) for Example 4.2. We know
that (1 /3,0) and (0 ,1/3) are fixed points of ϕ2that have the same displacements and so
they globally shadow and thus have the same ˜βvalue. This overlap or intersection of the
30two branches does not show up in Figure 3 (left). The figure is drawn with k= 4 and the
approaching corners are thus the images of the points ˜ ziand ˜z′
iwhich approximate (1 /3,0)
and (0 ,1/3). It is clear that in this context, 1 /3 not well approximated by anyi
4k.
The intersections visible in Figure 3 (left) come from another source, namely, the non-
injectivity of ˜ϕ2acting on ˜Xa. For if ˜ϕk
2(˜x) =˜ϕk
2(˜y) certainly for all m > 0A−m−k˜ϕm+k
2(˜x) =
A−m−k˜ϕm+k
2(˜y) and so ˜β(˜x) =˜β(˜y). For example, ˜ϕ2(1/2,0) = ˜ϕ2(1,−1/2) = (2 ,0) by direct
calculation.
