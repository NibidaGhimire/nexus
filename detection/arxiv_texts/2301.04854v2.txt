Abstract
We study the mixed-state entanglement for AdS Born-Infeld (BI) theory. We calculate the
mixed-state entanglement and investigate the relationship between it and the system parameters.
We find that the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and mutual information (MI) exhibit
monotonically increasing and decreasing behavior with BI factor b. However, the entanglement
wedge cross-section (EWCS) exhibits a very rich set of phenomena about system parameters.
EWCS always increases with bwhen bis small and then monotonically decreases with b. These
behaviors suggest that increasing the BI factor, which is essentially enhancing the coupling be-
tween the background geometry and the transport properties can always enhance the EWCS. The
coupling between the entanglement and the transport behaviors has also been studied in condensed
matter theories and is important to construct a stable quantum circuit. We also provide analytical
understanding of the above phenomenon. Furthermore, we have tested two additional BI-like mod-
els and find the universality of these results, suggesting the crucial role of the BI term in governing
the interplay between nonlinear electromagnetic effects and entanglement.

I. INTRODUCTION
Quantum entanglement is the most distinguishing characteristic between quantum and
classical systems. Holographic gravity, condensed matter theory, quantum information, and
other areas have recently overlapped with each other on quantum entanglement. Numerous
quantum entanglement measurements have been discovered to be capable of diagnosing the
quantum phase transition of strong correlation systems and the topological quantum phase
transitions, as well as playing a key role in the emergence of spacetime [1–8].
There are numerous types of quantum entanglement measurements, including entangle-
ment entropy (EE), mutual information (MI), R´ enyi entanglement entropy, and negativity.
Among these quantum entanglement measurements, EE is commonly considered a useful
2measure of pure state entanglement. However, EE is not applicable to measure the more
common mixed-state entanglement. To measure mixed-state entanglement, numerous new
entanglement measurements, such as the entanglement of purification, non-negativity, and
the entanglement of formation, have been proposed [9, 10]. On the other hand, calculating
the mixed-state entanglement measures is extremely difficult.
Gauge/gravity duality is a powerful tool for analyzing strongly correlated systems because
it connects entanglement-related physical quantities to geometric objects in dual gravity
systems. In the dual gravity system, the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) connects
the EE of a subregion on the boundary with the area of the minimum surface [5]. HEE
has been demonstrated to be able to detect quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic
phase transitions [11–15]. Recently, the R´ enyi entropy was proposed to be proportional
to the minimal area of cosmic branes [16]. Moreover, the butterfly effect that reflects the
dynamic properties of quantum systems, has been extensively studied in holographic theories
[17–26]. In addition, the holographic duality of quantum complexity, a new information-
related quantity from the EE, was also proposed [27–33]. More recently, the EWCS was
associated with the area of the minimum cross-section of the entanglement wedge [34, 35].
The geometric prescription of EWCS provides a novel and powerful tool for studying the
mixed-state entanglement in holographic theories [36–44].
Among all the models in holographic theories, the Born-Infeld (BI) model is a special class
of models for nonlinear electromagnetic field theories. It was first proposed to eliminate the
divergent self-energy of the Maxwell theory. Later, it was found that the BI theory can be
naturally derived from the string theory under the low-energy approximation. The BI model
under the holographic theories can be dual to the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) systems
[45, 46], and some condensed matter systems with novel transport behaviors, such as the
quantum liquid [47], the Mott-insulator [48], and the novel magneto-resistance phenomenon
[49, 50], which is consistent with the experimental phenomenon in [51, 52]. Various properties
of the BI model, such as its thermodynamic properties, transport properties [53], and the
complexity [54], have been extensively investigated. However, the question of how exactly the
BI factor b, which embodies the nonlinearity of this nonlinear electromagnetic field theory,
affects the properties of the system, especially the mixed-state entanglement properties,
remains to be answered.
This paper focuses on the effect of the BI factor on two measures of mixed-state en-
3tanglement - MI and EWCS. When b→0, the background geometry is AdS-Schwarzschild
solution, and the entanglement property of the system is decoupled from the transport prop-
erty of the system; while for non-zero b, the transport behaviors can affect the entanglement
property. Therefore, we interpret bas the degree of correlation between the entanglement
and transport properties of the metric when bincreases from zero. Remind also that the
coupling between the transport properties and the entanglement is also an important topic
in condensed matter field theory, and is crucial for the construction of a stable quantum cir-
cuit [55–61]. For b→ ∞ , the system goes to the AdS-RN black brane system with a linear
Maxwell field. Therefore, the range b∈(0,∞) represents the process that the Maxwell field
turns on and converges to a linear Maxwell field case. Our main goal is to explore how BI
factor baffects the MI and EWCS.
We organize this paper as follows: we introduce the holographic BI model in Sec. II A,
entanglement measures (HEE, MI, EWCS) and their holographic duality in Sec. II B. We
discuss the properties of HEE, MI (III) and EWCS (IV) systematically. Subsequently, we
examine two more BI-like models to further validate our results in V. Finally, we summarize
in Sec. VI.

QUANTITIES
First, we review the holographic BI model. Following that, we review the concepts of the
HEE, MI, and EWCS with their holographic dual. Then, we elaborate upon our algorithms
proposed to calculate minimum surfaces and minimum cross-sections.

The planar case is always thermodynamically stable [62]. Therefore, in this BI black brane
system, there is no thermodynamic phase transition.

For numerical convenience, we transform rintoz≡rh/rsuch that the semi-infinite
domain r∈(rh,∞) becomes a finite domain z∈[0,1]. Then the metric becomes,

Therefore, the quantity Qis restricted to the range [0 ,√

Tdecreases as Qincreases. This system is described by three variables ( T, b , r h), with
only two of them being independent. We have also observed that for any given value of
b, the temperature Talways increases with increasing rh, thus, the value of rhis uniquely
determined by a given temperature T. This can be seen in the Fig. 1. Therefore, we can
simplify the system to a two-parameter system ( b, T).
When the parameter b→ ∞ , the background solution of our system converges to the
AdS-RN solution, and when b→0, it becomes the AdS-Schwarzschild solution. When bis
zero, there is an electromagnetic field present, but the background solution is still the AdS-
Schwarzschild solution. This means that the entanglement-related physical quantities are
not affected by the conductivity of the system. However, as bincreases, the electromagnetic

fields starts to affect the background solution, and thus has an impact on the entanglement
structure of the system. Therefore, we refer to increasing bfrom zero to infinity as the
process of turning on the coupling between the background and the conductivity, and finally
resulting in an AdS-RN system.
It is worth noting that the relationship between conductivity and entanglement-related
quantities is of great importance in condensed matter theories.
In most condensed matter systems, quantum entanglement shows an intricate connection
to transport properties like thermal and electrical conductivity [55–58]. The underlying
quantum coherence enables nonlocal correlations can directly manifest in the measurable
transport. For instance, in quantum spin chains, the entanglement between distant spins
allows energy transport despite the lack of individual particle motion [55]. However, in cer-
tain important cases, the entanglement can become decoupled from the transport behavior.
For example, in topological insulators, the robust edge state transport persists regardless
of the bulk entanglement due to topological protection [56]. This illustrates the irrelevance
between entanglement and transport. Though counterintuitive, such irrelevance underscores
the delicate nature of quantum effects.
Recent experiments have shown that entanglement between quantum dots can persist
despite the influence of surface plasmon polariton (SPPs) transmission [60, 61, 63]. These
7findings are crucial for the development of stable quantum circuits. Additionally, it has been
found that at specific values of the inter-dot distance dor detuning δ, the two-quantum-dot
system can be in a highly entangled state and be separate from the transmission of SPPs
[59]. However, when dorδdeviate from these values, the entanglement of quantum dots
becomes highly correlated with the transmission of SPPs. This suggests that decoupling of
entanglement and transport can exist in real physical systems and can be characterized by
certain parameters. Properly modeling the coupling and decoupling between entanglement
and transport remains an open challenge. Advanced theoretical frameworks need to be
developed that can transition between the two regimes.
Next, we will focus on how the entanglement-related physical quantities change as we
vary the parameter b.
B. Holographic information-related quantities
Entanglement is a fundamental and intriguing aspect of quantum mechanics. One way
to quantify entanglement is through entanglement entropy (EE), which measures the degree
of entanglement between a subset of a system and the rest of the system. Specifically, the
entanglement entropy SAbetween subsets AandBof a system A∪Bis defined as the von
Neumann entropy in terms of the reduced density matrix ρA.
SA(|ψ⟩) =−Tr [ρAlogρA], ρ A= Tr B(|ψ⟩⟨ψ|). (13)
It is easy to find that SA=SBfor pure states [64]. Holographic duality theory relates the
holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) to the area of the minimum surface in dual gravity
systems [5] (see the left plot of Fig. 2).
EE is often used to measure the degree of entanglement in pure states, but it is not as
effective in measuring mixed state entanglement. For example, even when subsystems Aand
Bare not entangled, they can still have non-zero EE in a system composed of direct product
of the density matrices of ρAandρB. This is because EE takes into account both quantum
entanglement and classical correlation, so it does not always provide a accurate measure
of the entanglement. As a result, other measures for mixed-state entanglement have been
proposed in the literature [9, 10]. The most direct mixed-state entanglement measure is MI.

FIG. 2: The left plot: The minimum surface for a given width w. The right plot: The minimum
cross-section (green surface) of the entanglement wedge.
For the subsystem A∪Cseparated by B, the mutual information (MI) is defined as:
I(A, B) :=S(A) +S(B)−S(A∪B), (14)
This measures the mixed-state entanglement between AandB. It can be easily verified
thatI(A, B) = 0 when ρAB=ρA⊗ρB, therefore MI have the property that direct product
states have zero entanglement. However, MI is not a perfect measure of mixed-state entan-
glement, as it is closely related to EE, and it’s properties are sometimes dominated by EE
or thermal entropy in certain situations. This indicates that other measures of mixed-state
entanglement should be used.
The entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS) has been associated with the duality of
certain mixed-state entanglement measures, such as entanglement of purification, logarith-
mic negativity, and reflect entropy [65–67]. Takayanagi proposed that EWCS EW(ρAB) is
the area of the minimum cross-section Σ ABin connected entanglement wedge [34], i.e.(see
the right plot in Fig. 2),
EW(ρAB) = min
ΣABArea (Σ AB)
4GN
. (15)
It is important to note that if the entanglement wedge is disconnected, meaning the minimum
cross-section does not exist, the EWCS will be zero, it corresponds to cases with vanish-
ing MI. Additionally, the EWCS also satisfies some important inequalities as its quantum
information counterparts [34, 68]
Next, we present the algorithm for obtaining the minimum surfaces and EWCS.
9C. Computations of holographic geometric quantities
We examine the EWCS of an infinite strip with a homogeneous background for numerical
simplicity. For a generic homogeneous background
ds2=gttdt2+gzzdz2+gxxdx2+gyydy2, (16)
where z= 0 represents the boundary of the asymptotic AdS spacetime. The left plot in
Fig. 3 is a visual representation of the minimum surface for an infinite strip along the y-
axis. Since the background is homogeneous, all metric components gµνonly depend on the
coordinate z.
1. The minimum surface
The minimum surface near the AdS boundary is perpendicular to the boundary, making
the spatial direction xan unsuitable parameter for finding the minimum surface. Ref. [69]
adopted the angle θwith tan θ=z/x, as the parameter for the minimum surface (see Fig.
3). Using this method, we can parametrize a surface as ( x(θ), z(θ)) with area Agiven by

2. The EWCS
Given a biparty subsystem with minimum surfaces C1(θ1), C2(θ2), we solve the minimum
surface Cp1,p2connecting p1∈C1andp2∈C2. We parametrize Cp1,p2with z, then the area
10ofCp1,p2reads,

with boundary conditions,
x(z(θ1)) =x(θ1), x(z(θ2)) =x(θ2). (22)
To obtain the EWCS, we need to locate the global minimum of the minimum surfaces
connecting C1(θ1), C2(θ2), i.e., the minimum cross-section.
Finding the minimum cross-section is a challenging task as it involves searching through
a two-dimensional parameter space ( θ1, θ2). However, it can be noted that the globally
minimum cross-section must be perpendicular to the minimum surfaces at the point of
intersection. This observation serves as a local constraint, which can greatly speed up the
search process. We demonstrate the methods of solving the EWCS in Fig. 3. For numerical
stability, it is better to implement the perpendicular conditions with normalized vectors as,

Note that Q1andQ2are both functions of the θ1andθ2. Now, the search of the EWCS is
equivalent to finding the minimum surface ending at ( θ1, θ2) where (23) is satisfied.
To determine the correct EWCS, we first select an initial seed ( θ1, θ2) and use the Newton
iterative method to obtain feedback ( δθ1, δθ2). By repeating this process, we can find the
minimum cross-section, which is the EWCS. It is crucial to carefully choose the initial
values of ( θ1, , θ2) for the iterations to converge. The numerical reliability is ensured by
the convergence of results when using different initial values or increasing the density of
discretization. For more technical details, refer to reference [70].

Using the techniques outlined above, we will now examine mixed-state entanglement
measures for the BI model. Additionally, we will examine the correlation between the BI
factor band information-related quantities.
III. THE HOLOGRAPHIC ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY AND THE HOLO-
GRAPHIC MUTUAL INFORMATION
We begin by examining the relationship between HEE, system parameters bandT. As
shown in Fig. 4, HEE, represented by S, increases monotonically with both bandT, but
their rate of increase is different. Initially, Sincreases slowly with Tand its growth rate
with Tbecomes more pronounced as Tincreases. On the other hand, Sincreases quickly
with bat first and then slows down as bdecreases. Next, we explain the behavior of Swith
bandT, respectively.
On the gravity side, the HEE is related to the area of the minimum surface. Especially,
when the horizon radius of the black brane increases, the minimum surface tends to be closer

to the horizon of the black brane, which makes the thermodynamic entropy dominate the
behavior of the HEE. Therefore, the growth of HEE with Tas well as b, can be understood
from the relation between rhandTorb. According to (7) we can deduce that rhincreases
with increasing temperature and b, this can be seen by taking the derivative of rhwith
respect to Tandb. The results are,

From the above equation, it is clear that ∂Trhis always positive, indicating that rhincreases
asTincreases. However, ∂brhcan be positive or negative, depending on the specific pa-
rameter range. Further examination shows that ∂brhis always greater than zero when rhis
relatively large. This means that rhincreases with bwhen rhis large, or when the minimum
surface is closer to the horizon of the black brane. When bis relatively large, the system
is approximately the AdS-RN system. The argument presented in [71] can be applied to
prove that ∂TS > 0. Furthermore, for small subregions, it can be inferred from the equa-
tions in [71] that ∂TSis close to 0, which explains the flat behavior of Salong Tfor small
temperatures.
After studying HEE, we proceed to investigate the behavior of MI with Tandb. In the BI
model, the configurations for MI and EWCS are subsystems composed of aandbseparated
by region p. As seen in Fig. 5, MI decreases with increasing temperature and b. This is in
contrast to the behavior of HEE. Moreover, it is worth noting that MI can decrease to zero,

which is an indication of a disentanglement phase transition. We have also plotted the MI
for smaller configurations (see Fig. 6), and the qualitative phenomena remain the same.
As the subsystem cand the separation pchange, the system undergoes a disentangling
phase transition, at which point the entanglement of two subsystems aandcvanishes. The
critical value of subsystem ccand separation pcare shown in Fig. 7. The left plot of Fig. 7
shows that the critical value of subsystem ccincreases with bandT; however, the right plot
of Fig. 7 shows that the critical value of the separation pcdecreases with bandT. This is
as expected since increasing the temperature or bwill tends to destroy the entanglement,
resulting in a larger subregion ccor a smaller separation pc.
In summary, both HEE and MI exhibit monotonic behavior with respect to the BI factor

b, but in opposite manner - HEE increases while MI decreases. From the gravity side, the
thermal contribution to HEE and MI dominates as rhincreases with b, which leads to the
monotonic dependence on b. From a perspective rooted in the AdS/CFT correspondence,
the thermal effects dominate the entanglement behavior observed on the boundary CFT.
However, EWCS, being minimum cross-sections anchored on the minimum surfaces, may
exhibit different behavior from the black hole thermal physics. Investigating EWCS could
unveil new perspectives on mixed state entanglement.
Next, we explore the mixed-state entanglement through the EWCS.
IV. THE HOLOGRAPHIC ENTANGLEMENT WEDGE CROSS-SECTION
In Fig. 8, we present the minimum surfaces and the corresponding minimum cross-
sections. It can be observed that the minimum surface is flatter when the temperature is
lower. This is due to the fact that the coordinate zis related to the horizon radius rh, and at
lower temperatures, a small rhwill rescale ztozrh, resulting in a flatter minimum surface.
This makes it challenging to obtain precise enough solutions for the minimum surface since
the flat case is more singular in the θcoordinate. To overcome this issue, we redefine the
angle as z=ηxtan(θ), where ηis a number related to the temperature. Only with this
technique, we can achieve precise enough solutions.
We show the EWCS vs bin Fig. 9, from which we can find that the EWCS can show very
delicate behaviors. The EWCS increases with bat first in a very narrow range of b, however,

minimum cross-section always ends at the point near the tops of the inner minimum surface, while
ends at the point away from the tops of the outer minimum surface.

FIG. 9: EWCS vs T. This plot is obtained at ( a, p, c ) = (0 .1,0.05,0.06925). When bis relatively
large, the EWconverges to certain fixed values. For T= 0.2971 it can first increase, and later
decreases, and after that increases with b. Therefore, for very small bthe EWCS increases with b,
irrespective of the values of the Tand the configurations.
it starts to decrease with bwhen bis relatively large and monotonically decreases with b.
This is in sharp contrast to the behavior of the HEE and MI, that only shows monotonical
behaviors (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). In addition, the EWchanges slower with bthan that with
T. The typical change is of order 10−4and 10−3, respectively. This delicate behavior can
be captured precisely because the precision of our numerical methods can be up to 10−7.
Notice that the background is an AdS-Schwarzschild solution when bis 0, meanwhile, its
electromagnetic field is non-zero. At this point, the charge transport behavior of the system
16is significantly different from that of the genuine AdS-Schwarzschild system. Moreover,
since its geometry is still AdS-Schwarzschild, the entanglement-related geometric quantities
will be decoupled from the charge transport. As bgradually increases, the background
geometry will receive back reactions from the Maxwell field. At this time, the entanglement-
related geometry starts to couple with the charge transports. Therefore, bcan play a role
in measuring the relationship between entanglement and transport when bis small. As we
have pointed out, the EWCS increases with bwhen bis very small, i.e., when the coupling
has just occurred. And when bincreases further, the EWCS gradually shows a decreasing
behavior. Notice that simpler geometric quantities such as HEE, and MI only show a very flat
monotonic behavior. This indicates that EWCS, as a mixed-state entanglement, captures
very different properties from HEE and MI.
To understand the above behavior more clearly, we implement the following analytical
treatments. For small values of b, we can expand the expression of the EW(20) integral

ofb. This explains the ubiquitous existence of the monotonically increasing behavior of
EWvsbfor small values of b. From the holographic dual picture, it means that when the
Maxwell field starts to turn on from the BI case, the EWis increased. However, when
further increasing bwe find that EWreaches local maximums and starts to decrease. When
bis large, it can be expected that the background system approaches the AdS-RN, a fixed
background geometry. Therefore, the EWwill starts to converge to some fixed value. For
sufficiently large values of b, it is possible to derive the analytical expression for EWthrough
expansions. The expression is given by Equation 26,
EW=Z

where Θ( z) is defined as,

The second term in (26) reveals that EWdecreases as bbecomes larger. Consequently, since
EWincreases for small values of band decreases for large values of b, there must exist at

least one critical value of bat which EWreaches its maximum for a continuous function.
This observation aligns with the numerical results and provides an explanation for the non-
monotonic behavior of EWwith respect to b.
In the context of gravity, the non-monotonic behavior of EWCS versus bcan be inter-
preted by its increasing tendencies at smaller bvalues and decreasing tendencies at larger
ones. What separates EWCS from the typical monotonic behavior of HEE and MI is its
location within the bulk. This positioning frees it from the overpowering influence of ther-
mal effects. Furthermore, EWCS is unique due to its second-order minimization process,
compared to HEE and MI that are associated with first-order minimization. This allows
EWCS to capture different degrees of freedom in the quantum system. On the flip side, in
the dual field theory, mixed state entanglement, such as entanglement of purification, also
involves the second-order minimization. This difference also provides an explanation for the
distinct behavior observed.
Next, we show the EWCS in larger configurations in Fig. 10. As seen in Fig. 10, the
non-monotonicity of EWwith bbecomes more pronounced as the width of the configuration
increases. This means that the non-monotonicity exists over a wider interval. The reason
for this is that when the width is relatively small, the minimum surface and the minimal
cross-section are only slightly different from the properties of AdS. However, as the width
increases, they deviate more significantly from AdS.
Next, we examine the behavior of EWCS with temperature. When the configuration is
relatively small in BI systems, EWCS decreases monotonically with temperature, as shown
in the left plot of Fig. 11. It is worth noting that the non-monotonic behavior of EWCS at

extremely small temperatures has been studied in [71] for AdS-RN systems. Additionally,
we illustrate the behavior of EWCS with temperature for larger configurations in the right
plot of Fig. 11, which also shows that EWCS decreases monotonically with temperature.
Although the monotonic decreasing behaviors are similar, the EWCS curves for small con-
figurations differ from those for large configurations. By comparing the two plots in Fig.
11, crossovers of the EWCS curves with temperature can be observed in the larger configu-
ration, which reflects the non-monotonic behavior of EWCS with b. These findings suggest
that the behavior of EWCS is generally monotonically decreasing with temperature, and
this behavior is consistent with that of MI.
In order to more clearly demonstrate the relationship between the EWCS and variables

plot illustrates the non-monotonic nature of EWCS with respect to band the monotonic
decrease of EWCS as Tincreases.
The non-monotonic dependence of the EWCS on the BI factor bthat we have demon-
strated is expected to be universal for BI-like nonlinear electromagnetism. To test this
universality beyond the specific holographic model studied here, we will examine two addi-
tional BI-like theories. Observing similar non-monotonicity will confirm the crucial role of
the BI term in generating this entanglement behavior, independently of other holographic
dual details. Studying additional models will also elucidate the interplay between nonlinear
electromagnetic effects and entanglement.

V. BORN-INFELD WITH AXIONS AND BORN-INFELD WITH MASSIVE
GRAVITY
We aim to extend our investigation of holographic information measures by exploring two
additional modifications of Born-Infeld (BI) theory. Specifically, we will examine BI theory
coupled to axions and BI theory with massive gravity terms.
In the case of BI theory with axions, previous research focused on analyzing holographic
transport in a model that incorporates the Born-Infeld term and axion fields ϕI=αxI,
where I= 1,2 and αis a constant. The action for this model is given by [53],

In this study, the DC and AC conductivities were analytically computed, revealing a
temperature-dependent DC conductivity. The analysis also observed a transition from co-
herent to incoherent transport, which depended on parameters such as b.
For BI theory with massive gravity, the action considered includes the Einstein-Hilbert,

The authors obtained black hole solutions and conducted a comprehensive analysis of their
thermodynamic stability and phase transitions. Notably, they found that properties such
as the heat capacity CQand phase structure were influenced by the nonlinear Born-Infeld
coupling parameter band the massive gravity terms.
First, we present the results for the BI-axion model, where we examine the behavior of
holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and mutual information (MI) with respect to the
parameter b. The corresponding figures are shown in Fig. 13. It is evident that the HEE

monotonically increases with b, while the MI decreases. Additionally, Fig. 14 demonstrates
the non-monotonic behavior of the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS). The EWCS
also exhibits non-monotonic behavior with respect to b. These observations in the BI-axion
model align with those observed in the pure BI model.

Next, we investigate the BI model with massive gravity. Fig. 15 illustrates the behavior

monotonically increases with b, while the MI decreases. Furthermore, Fig. 16 presents
the non-monotonic behavior of the EWCS in the EN-BI massive gravity model. Again,
the EWCS exhibits non-monotonicity with respect to b. The phenomena observed in the
BI-axion model are consistent with those observed in the pure BI model.
Based on the aforementioned observations in both the BI-axion model and the BI model
with massive gravity, we propose that the Born-Infeld term governs the monotonic behavior
of HEE, MI, and EWCS with respect to b, as all three models exhibit qualitatively similar
results. This suggests the universality of the phenomenon across BI-like theories, highlight-
ing the significance of the Born-Infeld term in modeling the coupling between entanglement

warranted to gain insights into strongly correlated systems.
VI. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we study the behavior of HEE, MI, and the mixed-state entanglement
measure EWCS in the BI model. Our results show that HEE increases monotonically with
both bandT, while MI decreases monotonically with both bandT. Interestingly, the
behavior of EWCS with respect to bshows a non-monotonic trend. Specifically, when bis
small, EWCS increases with b, but it begins to decrease as bincreases further. In contrast,
EWCS exhibits a consistent monotonically decreasing trend with T.
Note that when bis small, bserves as a measure of the coupling between the entanglement-
related quantities and the charge transport of the system. Based on this observation, we
conjecture that increasing the coupling between the entanglement-related quantities and the
transport properties can enhance the EWCS of the system. This coupling between transport
behaviors and entanglement is also a topic of significant interest in condensed matter theory,
as seen in previous studies on nanowires [59], plasmonics [61, 63], and plasmons [60].
The HEE increases consistently with temperature Tand the BI factor bin the gravity
perspective. This is due to the expansion of the black hole horizon radius rh, which brings
the HEE minimum surface closer to the horizon. As a result, the HEE behavior is primarily
23influenced by the thermal entropy from the black hole. From the viewpoint of the dual CFT,
this monotonic relationship between HEE and T, as well as b, arises because thermal effects
dominate the entanglement entropy. Similarly, the MI decreases continuously with Tand
b, as it is defined based on the HEE. On the CFT side, increasing Tandbintroduce more
thermal noise, which disrupts entanglement in the boundary theory.
In contrast, the non-monotonic behavior of the EWCS is characterized by an initial in-
crease for small values of bfollowed by a subsequent decrease for large values of b. This
unique pattern emerges because the EWCS relies on the cross-section within the bulk inte-
rior, independent of the horizon’s influence. From a dual CFT perspective, the EWCS serves
as a probe for mixed state entanglement, which effectively avoids thermal noise. Moreover,
measures of mixed state entanglement, such as the entanglement of purification, involve a
second-order minimization process rather than a first-order one like HEE. This second-order
minimization enables the EWCS to capture new quantum information that is overlooked by
the thermal-dominated first-order measures like HEE or MI.
To test the universality of our results, we examined two additional BI-like holographic
models. In both models, we observed monotonic HEE and MI together with non-monotonic
EWCS dependence on the BI factor b. This alignment across the models suggests the
non-monotonic EWCS phenomenon originates specifically from the Born-Infeld term, inde-
pendently of other holographic details. Our observations highlight the crucial role of the
BI term in governing the interplay between nonlinear electromagnetic effects and entangle-
ment. The universality motivates further study of BI gravity to elucidate strongly correlated
systems.
Next, we point out the issues that deserve further investigation. To begin, we can examine
other BI-like theories, such as the BI theory with lattices or superconductivity, to further
test if the non-monotonic behavior observed in this paper is general. Furthermore, we can
examine the effect of more general nonlinear EM field theories on the entanglement-related
physical quantities of the system, such as the more general nonlinear EM fields [48, 73]. We
are working on these directions.
