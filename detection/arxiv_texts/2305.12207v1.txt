Abstract
Tumor heterogeneity is a challenge to designing eective and targeted ther-
apies. Glioma-type identication depends on specic molecular and histological
features, which are dened by the ocial WHO classication CNS. These guide-
lines are constantly updated to support the diagnosis process, which aects all the
successive clinical decisions. In this context, the search for new potential diagnos-
tic and prognostic targets, characteristic of each glioma type, is crucial to support
the development of novel therapies. Based on a TCGA glioma RNA-sequencing
dataset updated according to the 2016 and 2021 WHO guidelines, we proposed
a two-step variable selection approach for biomarker discovery. Our framework
encompasses the graphical lasso algorithm to estimate sparse networks of genes
carrying diagnostic information. These networks are then used as input for regu-
larised Cox survival regression model, allowing the identication of a smaller subset
of genes with prognostic value. In each step, the results derived from the 2016 and
2021 classes were discussed and compared. For both WHO glioma classications,
our analysis identies potential biomarkers, characteristic of each glioma type.
Yet, better results were obtained for the WHO CNS classication in 2021, thereby
supporting recent eorts to include molecular data on glioma classication.

1 Introduction
Glioma is one of the most common brain tumors, which in adults represents more
than 80% of malignant cancers in this organ [1]. One of the reasons why gliomas often
have a bad prognosis is because of their high heterogeneity, which arises from dierences
aecting histological and molecular levels [2]. Glioma samples are characterized by
dierent molecular proles and tumor cell types, which result in distinct glioma types.
The criteria for glioma classication are constantly revised according to new discoveries.
For many years, the diagnosis of glioma has been exclusively based on histology, being
recently subjected to a substantial revision with the inclusion of genetic information
in the classication procedure. Despite the importance of this continuous update, it
represents a challenge for diagnosis and design of eective therapies [3].
The World Health Organization (WHO) classication of the Central Nervous Sys-
tem (CNS) introduced molecular characteristics as part of the diagnosis of glioma
tumors in 2016 [4]. In particular, the status of the isozymes of the isocitrate dehy-
drogenase (IDH) gene family and the combined loss of the short arm chromosome 1
and the long arm of chromosome 19 (1p/19q codeletion) have been integrated with the
former histological diagnosis. This novelty represented a valuable improvement, given
the subjectivity of the histological evaluation. However, with this integrated diagnosis
contradictory results could arise, in case of patients showing inconsistent histological
and molecular features.
In 2021, the glioma classication procedure was updated [5], mainly focusing the
diagnosis on the evaluation of objective genetic features, and solving the problem of
possible contradictory diagnostic results that could arise from the 2016 approach. The
IDH mutation status became central for determining the tumor type since samples
exhibiting IDH mutation coupled with 1p/19q codeletion are classied as oligoden-
droglioma, while IDH-mutant samples not presenting 1p/19q codeletion are labeled
as astrocytoma. IDH-wildtype samples could be classied as glioblastoma (GBM) if
either certain histological features or genetic parameters are present. These modi-
cations in the glioma classication as dened by the WHO CNS guidelines aimed to
support as best as possible the diagnosis, which is the rst essential step to designing
an eective therapy [6]. Indeed, given the deep dierences in glioma, each type could
be inuenced by specic markers, having an impact on cancer development [7]. In this
context, discovering the existing underlying characteristics could be crucial to improve
patient prognosis [8].
Nowadays, thanks to modern data extraction techniques and gene sequencing ad-
vances, large sets of data are available. The huge dimension of these datasets, as well
2as the hidden relations existing between biological entities, make it challenging to in-
fer information linking variables and clinical outcome.To this end, mathematical and
statistical methods can be employed to tackle the problem and to identify potential
therapeutic targets.
The high dimensionality of the data poses challenging problems in model identi-
cation and parameter estimation, which can be addressed by means of regularization
techniques. These methods consist in adding a penalty term to the cost function of the
chosen statistical model. In recent years, regularization has been widely used in bioin-
formatics applications, and several methods have been developed to address this need
[9]. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) [10] represents the most
known regularization method. It considers as penalty the `1-norm of the coecients
that are the solution of the regression problem. This forces some estimated coecients
to be zero, thus simultaneously performing feature selection and estimation. However,
when the number of features ( p) is much larger than the number of samples ( n) the
feature selection becomes arbitrary, e.g., among correlated features that can predict
the outcome, lasso may choose to include one (or a subset) and exclude others ran-
domly. Since the genes cannot be considered as independent features, as they are part
of interconnected networks, graph theory can eectively be employed to determine the
relations between them. As a results, network estimation techniques have been widely
used in precision oncology [11, 12], also in the context of glioma [13].
Many techniques have been developed to estimate a graph starting from real data
[14]. In this work, we employed graphical lasso, a widely known method combining
regularization and network estimation [15]. Graphical lasso estimates relations between
variables introducing sparsity through lasso regularization. It is particularly accurate
for huge datasets ( pn), and it has been applied in many elds [16, 17, 18].
Besides the identication of meaningful diagnostic features from the overall net-
work, the evaluation of their prognostic role is an invaluable contribution. Regularized
survival analysis can be used to this end. Statistical methods for survival analysis esti-
mate the probability of the occurrence of a given event, e.g., death, in a certain period
of time, taking into account patients' data, including clinical information [19]. Among
them, we used the Cox regression model, which is able to determine the association of
a set of features with the time until the event of interest occurs [20]. Coupling survival
analysis with regularization techniques allows for the selection of features carrying in-
formation about the overall network and survival and therefore promising as prognostic
biomarkers.
In this work, we considered data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program,
consisting of a huge dataset ( pn) of RNA-sequencing (RNASeq), from the LGG
and GBM projects [21, 22, 23]. These datasets have been preprocessed to assess the
graphical lasso hypothesis and to update the sample classication [24] according to the
2016 and the 2021 WHO CNS guidelines. Through the graphical lasso method, we
reduced the dimensionality of the dataset by selecting a subset of variables for each
glioma type, and we analyzed the results by identifying key features ( hubs) within the
3estimated networks. We performed survival analysis through Cox regression model [20]
with regularisation with the lasso penalty [10], by considering (i) the set of selected
variables, (ii) the variables that have been exclusively selected from each glioma type,
and (iii) the hub genes. This approach allowed us to assess if the variables selected for
their diagnostic relevance also carry prognostic information.
The paper is structured as follows. In the materials and methods section, we
start introducing the basis of graphical lasso and Cox regression methods, and we
describe the datasets and the workow of our analysis. In the results section, the
model outcomes are presented and analyzed. A comprehensive discussion links our
results with the biological interpretation. Finally, the conclusion resumes our main
contribution.
2 Material and methods
2.1 Graphical lasso
LetGbe a graph with X= (X1;:::;Xp) nodes (variables) having a multivariate
normal distribution X Np(0;). Let  and Sbe the theoretical and empirical
covariance matrix, respectively.
The graphical lasso [15], herein designated as glasso, nds the precision matrix
 =  1, by solving the following Gaussian log-likelihood maximization problem:

wheretr() is the trace operator. The presence of the regularization term jjjj1serves
as penalty, providing a weight on the elements of the matrix , and inducing sparsity
into the solution. The value of the regularization parameter determines the degree of
sparsity. It has been proved that the network structure of the graph Gcan be estimated
based on the non-zero entrances of  [25]. In particular, if  i;j= 0, for certain iand
j(i6=j), it means that the variables XiandXjare conditionally independent given
the othersXk; k= 1;:::;n; k6=i;j.
2.2 Cox regression modelling with lasso regularisation
Cox regression is a survival model that relates the rate of an event happening
in a given time point (e.g., death) with several factors. Given pfeatures (e.g, gene
expressions) for nsamples, and let ( Yi; i),i= 1;:::;n be, respectively, the survival
time and the indicator of the occurrence of the event ( i2f0;1g) of the i-th patient.
The goal of a survival models is estimating the hazard function, i.e., the failure rate
depending on time. If we dene that function as
h(tjXi) =h0(t) expXi;
4whereho(t) is a baseline hazard function, the Cox regression model determines the
coecients = (1;:::;p) that maximize the following partial log-likelihood function:

To study the relationship between predictor variables and survival outcome in a
high-dimensional scenario ( pn), the Cox regression model can be regularised by
including a penalty function P(). In this work, we considered lasso regularization
[10], therefore P() =jjjj1.
2.3 Dataset preprocessing and framework
The dataset selection procedure and the workow of our analysis are summarized
in Figure 1. The glioma dataset we used in this study is available on TCGA portal, un-
der the LGG and GBM projects, and it has been downloaded by the getFirehoseData
function of RTCGAToolbox package [26], from R software (version 3.5.1, https://www.r-
project.org). This dataset contains expression levels from 20,503 genes, normalized by
transcript per million and quartile normalizations. We updated the patient' diagno-
sis according to both 2016 and 2021 WHO CNS guidelines, by integrating patient'
molecular proles [27] and reproducing the procedure explained in [24]. We considered
samples reporting the survival time information, in order to perform survival analy-
sis. Regarding the GBM dataset, we considered samples related to \untreated primary
gbm".
To assess the assumption of normality required by glasso, we applied the normal-
ization with huge.npn function from the huge R package [28], which implements the
gausianization through the nonparanormal transformation. For our study, we con-
sidered only the variables with normal distribution, according to the Jarque-Bera test
[29]. Finally, following the 2016 WHO CNS classication, our reference dataset contains
16471 normally distributed variables for 270 astrocytoma, 224 oligodendroglioma, and
149 GBM samples. Following the 2021 WHO classication, the dataset is constituted
of 16,454 normally distributed variables for 254 astrocytoma, 166 oligodendroglioma,
and 199 GBM samples (Figure 1; Preprocessing).
For the rst step of our methodology, glasso has been applied to each dataset,
separately. The estimation of sparse networks led to a network-based variable selection,
which has been mathematically validated in order to assess the reliability of the set
of identied variables (see A). The process of variable selection produced a dierent
subset of genes for each glioma type, namely, 468, 577, and 370 genes for astrocytoma,
oligodendroglioma, and GBM, considering 2016 WHO classication, whereas 531, 738,
and 362 genes for astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM, considering 2021 WHO
5classication (Figure 1; 1st step). These have been used as starting datasets to perform
the second step of survival analysis, as explained in the following sections.

TCGA-GBM databases, we obtained 6 datasets (3 for each classication procedure).
(1st step) glasso algorithm has been applied separately on each glioma type, obtaining
the network-based variable reduction. The number of features selected for any given
type is reported in the second box of the pipeline. Green indicates astrocytoma (Astro),
orange is oligodendroglioma (Oligo) and blue represents GBM. (2nd step) the features
selected by the previous step are used as input for the survival analysis. All the datasets
consider a matrix comprising all the glioma samples and dierent variables, depending
on the case of study. Case 1 takes into account all the selected variables. Case 2 refers
to the variables exclusively selected from each glioma type. Case 3 considers only the
hub genes. Boxes in gure indicate the number of variables of the starting datasets.
In each step, the analysis and the comparison between the two classication outcomes
have been performed.
2.4 Implementation of variable selection
The variable selection was performed by applying glasso through the huge.glasso
function of the huge R package [28], by setting the regularization parameter = 0:9.
This value has been empirically chosen in order to consistently reduce the number
of variables and increase interpretability. Indeed, as mentioned in Section 2.1, the
regularization term determines the sparsity of the precision matrix . As consequence,
setting a high value of , many variables will result unconnected within the graph,
allowing for a network-based variable selection. To identify key nodes in each network,
6we introduced two dierent measures. Given a variable Xi, the weight measure consists
in evaluating the degree of the i-th node as:
mi=nX
j=1;j6=ijijj;
while its count measure represents the number of the connection of the variable:
mi=nX
j=1;j6=iqij;
whereqi= 1, ifjijj>0,qi= 0 otherwise. As such, the genes can be sorted in
ascending order according to both these measures, obtaining, for each dataset, two
ranked lists of genes.
To identify the subset of the most relevant variables, for each list, we re-scaled the
computed measures, by distributing them uniformly in [0 ;100]. Then, let pibe the
value of the measure miconverted in percentage, we dened Xias a hubvariable if
pi> t, for a certain threshold t. The threshold parameter choice is a crucial point
of our analysis. Setting too low values could result in big sets of variables, which is
hard to interpret. Conversely, too high thresholds could remove important variables,
which will be omitted from our analysis. The dimension of the set of variables selected
through glasso also inuences this choice, since the larger the set is, the more we need to
lter our results. We manually analyzed the glasso results, with the aim of identifying
a discriminating value able to divide the list of variables into the hubs and non-hubs
groups. We observed that in astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma cases, the ranked
list of genes reported very close percentage measures, i.e., the dierence between the
measures of two following variables was almost constant, leading to no obvious choice
for the threshold. On the other hand, the variables selected from GBM dataset can
clearly be divided into two groups, with a consistent variation of measure values around
60%. For this reason, we set t= 60. Each measure selects a subset of hub features,
thus we considered as nal hubs the union of these two subsets.
2.5 Regularized Cox Regression Modelling, Patient Stratication and
Survival Analysis
Survival analysis has been performed by a regularized Cox regression model, im-
plemented through the glmnet R package [30], by considering 3 cases. We considered
a Pan-Glioma dataset, composed by all glioma samples (LGG+GBM) and (case 1)
all the variables selected by glasso, (case 2) the variables exclusively selected by each
glioma type, and (case 3) only the features identied as hubs. This results in 6 datasets,
i.e., 3 cases for each glioma classication procedure (Figure 1-2nd step).
The parameter of lasso penalization during model tting was determined by
pmax , a parameter limiting the maximum number of candidate features to be selected
7to avoid overtting. For this study, we have set pmax based on the 10 EPV (events
per variable) rule of thumb [31, 32, 33], which relates the number of events with the
maximum number of predictors that can be studied. Therefore, pmax was set as the
ceiling function of the number of patients with the outcome event (death) divided
by 10. The 2016 and 2021 WHO CNS classications led to datasets composed by
233 and 226 events, which resulted in pmax =24 and pmax =23, respectively. Once
denedpmax , the value of the parameter has been computed through the function
glmnet , which determined the appropriate regularization parameter leading to the
chosen number of variables. The dataset dimensions and the parameters chosen in
each case are summarized in Table 2.
The function separate2GroupsCox from the glmSparseNet R package [34] was
used to separate the data into two groups of patients: high- and low-risk. This function
divides patients according to their prognostic index (PI), resulting from the matrix
multiplication of the data with the tted coecients. By default, patients are ordered
and stratied according to the median value of the PI distribution, i.e., a patient is
attributed to the low-risk group if its corresponding PI (computed using Cox model)
is below or equal to the median risk, and assigned to the high-risk group otherwise.
However, in all the dened datasets, the prognostic indexes exhibited a bivariate normal
distribution, not centered by the median value (Figure 1). Consequently, considering
the default stratication is not suitable for our study, since it could force samples to
belong to the wrong group.
To determine the threshold value in this imbalanced class situation, we computed a
kernel density estimation of the distribution of the PI by the density R function, and
we extracted the local minimum of such distribution between the two gaussian peaks
(cPI). Samples with PI cPIwere assigned to the low-risk group, while samples having
PI>cPIwere considered to be part of the high-risk group. Supplementary Figure 1
shows the distribution of prognostic indexes and the corresponding threshold, in each
case.
Based on this patient' stratication, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were drawn and
statistically compared with the log-rank test (hypothesis test to compare the distribu-
tion of time until the occurrence of an event in independent groups). A signicance
level of 0.05 was considered.
3 Results
In this section, the results obtained from variable selection and survival analysis
are shown. We discuss the outcomes in light of the comparison between the 2016 and
2021 WHO CNS guidelines, highlighting dierences and similarities arising from the
transcriptomics data. Finally, we used the obtained results as baseline knowledge to
explore the 2021 estimated networks.
83.1 Variable selection
We performed the variable selection by considering each glioma type, separately,
taking into account two classication procedures. We compared the genes which have
been selected for a given tumor type, classied according to the two dierent guidelines
(Figure 2; rst row). For astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma, the number of variables
selected by considering the 2021 WHO CNS classication was larger than the one
obtained by following the 2016 guidelines. On the other hand, looking at the output
derived from the 2016 classication, the percentage of variables exclusively selected
for GBM is double the one of LGG (astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma). However,
for all the types, the ranking of the genes that have been exclusively selected is very
low, considering both weight and count measures, and, among these genes, there are
no variables identied as hubs. The analysis has been repeated by considering the
hub gene subsets to discuss the dierences in selecting important features. Figure 2;
second row shows the result of this comparison. For astrocytoma and GBM, most 2016
hub genes are identied as important also according to the 2021 WHO CNS sample
classication, i.e., 95% and 73% of astrocytoma and GBM 2016 hubs, respectively.
In both cases, the 2021 classication led to a larger set of key features compared
with 2016. Dierently, for oligodendroglioma, our procedure selects more hub genes
by starting from the dataset obtained following the 2016 WHO CNS guidelines, with
almost 50% of key genes shared by both classications. Overall, all the hub genes
(exclusive hubs included) are in the subset of selected variables of the corresponding
glioma type, regardless of the classication procedure.
Given the genes identied as hubs exclusively for a certain classication, we can
check their rankings computed in the other classication. Commonly, these genes are
placed in high positions (green and purple boxes in the vectors in Figure 3), suggesting
that the hubs have a key role in the networks, independently from the considered
classication. Only a few genes do not follow this trend (dotted arrows in Figure
3) In particular, in 2021 GBM we identied CCNA2 as hub, which has an average
percentage measure of 2 in 2016 GBM. KIAA1045 and SYT13 have been recognized
as hubs in 2021 astrocytoma, but the average of their 2016 percentage measures is 4 and
8, respectively. The research literature on these genes revealed that all of them have
been associated with glioma by dierent bioinformatic analyses [35, 36], and CCNA2
has been recently proposed as an immunological biomarker for GBM [37].
As shown in Figure 4 (rst row), for both classication procedures, the three tumor
types share a considerable number of features. Nevertheless, we can observe more
similarities in gene selection between astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma, compared
to GBM. This result has been also conrmed by the analysis of the hub genes (Figure
4; second row), especially following the 2016 WHO CNS classication, where the set of
GBM hubs does not intersect with the others. The comparison of these diagrams also
show a big dierence in hub selection, in terms of shared/exclusive genes, revealing the
impact of the classication procedure in the selection of key features.

{ Astro {, oligodendroglioma { Oligo {, and GBM). Percentages in brackets refer to
the relative percentage of the exclusively selected variables for each set. The rst row
considers all the selected genes, while the second row is only about hub genes.
3.2 Survival analysis
For each classication, survival analysis was performed by considering datasets
comprising all the glioma samples and (case 1) the complete set of variables selected
by glasso, (case 2) only the subset of variables exclusively selected from each glioma
type, or (case 3) only the identied hub genes. We should note that the dataset
construction depends on the class labels, as the variables constituting each dataset have
been selected by applying glasso algorithm on each glioma type, separately. However,
the Cox regression model tting followed an unsupervised approach, i.e., the model
learnt through data that was unlabelled. Since the glioma types often exhibit dierent
prognosis, as validation of our results, we expect to nd an association between the
given diagnostic label and the prediction of survival.
Overall, our sets of variables allow a statistically signicant separation ( p-value
<10 16) of the two high- and low-risk groups, as shown in the Kaplan-Meier survival
curves in Figure 5. We observe that, although case 2 considers a widely reduced dataset
than case 1 (Table 2), the survival results are comparable. Moreover, the 2021 WHO
CNS classication leads to better results than 2016, since, in every case, the two curves
have a clearer separation.
To analyze the two high- and low-risk groups, we rst compared the patient strati-
cation obtained in the three cases (Figure 6). Overall, for both the classications, most

positions, respectively. Continuous arrows indicate the positions of most of the hubs.

of the samples are recognized to be part of the same group,i.e., about 90% and 78%
of samples are stably in the low- and high-risk groups, respectively, even by changing
the reference dataset. As consequence, to explore the tumor types associated with the
samples constituting these two groups, we can focus on one of these cases without loss
of generality. In particular, we discuss case 1, as its starting dataset includes both the
sets of variables of cases 2 and 3, increasing the reliability of the corresponding results.
Table 1 resumes the numbers and percentages of high- and low-risk samples iden-
tied in case 1, by specifying their glioma type. Considering the 2016 variables, the
high-risk group contains 179 samples. According to 2016 WHO CNS, 82 :7% of them
(n= 148) are classied as GBM, while the remaining 17 :3% are astrocytoma ( n= 24)
and oligodendroglioma ( n= 7). Curiously, most of the LGG samples being part of this
group, in 2021 change their classication to GBM. Conversely, the 2016-low-risk group
is constituted of 464 samples, among which 99 :8% are LGG. Only one GBM sample
is included in the 2016-low-risk group, which is diagnosed as astrocytoma in the 2021
classication. On the other side, the dataset obtained from the 2021 selected variables
leads to a high-risk group of 202 samples. The patients classied as GBM constitute
93:6% of them, while the other 6 :4% are astrocytoma. There are no oligodendroglioma
samples in the 2021-high-risk group. The low-risk group is mainly constituted by LGG
(97:6%), but there are 10 GBM samples. If we look at the histological features reported
by the TCGA clinical information, 5 over 13 2021-astrocytoma samples being part of

GBM samples have histological features of LGG (5 astrocytoma, 2 oligodendroglioma
and 2 mixed).
The regularised Cox regression model allowed for the selection of relevant features
to describe the patient's survival data. In case 1, 24 and 23 genes are identied,
respectively from the 2016 and 2021 classication datasets. We observed that 50% of
the 2016 genes were also selected either in case 2 ( n= 9) or case 3 ( n= 3). This
percentage increases by considering the 2021 variables, reaching 74% (15 genes in case
2, and 2 genes in case 3). To investigate the role of these genes in glioma disease, we
performed a literature review. Among the 35 genes, 12 are already known to have a role

to glioma by bioinformatic studies. We did not nd any cancer-related information for
the remaining 10 genes. More details are summarized in Table 3.

3.3 Gene networks from 2021 WHO CNS classication
The previous analyses denoted the 2021 WHO CNS classication as the most suit-
able for studying the glioma types. Moreover, survival analysis recognized the set of
exclusive genes as very informative for prognosis, since, in 2021, they represent 74% of
the variables identied as important to predict the patient's survival. For this reason,
in this section, we focus on the networks estimated through glasso on the 2021 dataset,
to further explore the relations linking genes that exclusively characterize the dierent
types.
Networks in Figures 7, 8, and 9 considered a subset of nodes composed of the genes
exclusively selected for each glioma type (yellow), and the ones directly linked with
them (white). Blue and pink nodes represent the genes selected as relevant in the sur-
vival analysis, which could be exclusive or shared by the tumor types, respectively. The
chosen layout for network representation is based on the Fruchterman-Reingold force-
directed algorithm implemented in qgraph R package [38], which distributes nodes

based on the distance between them: adjacent nodes are close, while not-connected
nodes are apart.
The GBM-network (Figure 7) comprises 175 nodes, among which 102 are exclu-
sive genes. On the left side, we can observe a dense group of nodes, including genes
selected for their prognostic value ( AURKA and SGOL1 ). The network includes 6 ex-
clusive genes selected by the regularized Cox regression model, and some of them are
involved in very strong connections, represented by bold edges. Specically, HMP19
andFAM115C are predicted to be linked with SVOP andLOC154761 , respectively. A
strong correlation can be also observed between AURKA and UBE2C , which are two
genes previously investigated for their combined eect in colorectal cancer [39, 40].
The astrocytoma-network has 262 nodes, but only 101 are exclusive of this tumor
type (Figure 8). Three big subnetworks can be identied in the graph. The one in
left-bottom includes also genes selected in the regularized survival model, which are
shared between the three glioma types ( HJURP and KIF20A ). Among the exclusive
genes selected by regularized survival model (blue nodes), only 3 have been identied

for astrocytoma. All the subnetworks are characterized by very strong connections, but
they mainly involve shared genes. A potential interesting small subnetwork is the one
involving three exclusive genes, FAM123C (selected in the regularized survival model),
ACTL6B and INA. Interestingly, a study about MDA-9/Syntenin dysregulation in
cancer pointed out these three genes as highly downregulated in glioma with high
MDA-9/syntenin expression [41].
The oligodendroglioma-network is the biggest one, with 552 nodes, and many ex-
clusive genes ( n= 348). We can observe 5 dense subnetworks, all of them including
genes with prognostic value (blue or pink). This network contains most of the exclu-
sive genes selected in the regularized survival model ( n= 13). Interestingly, all the
exclusive genes that in our literature review ended with no information are part of
this network. One of them, RAB36 , appears strongly connected in biggest subnetwork

4 Discussion
The main goal of this work was to discuss dierences and similarities at the tran-
scriptomic level between the two most recent glioma classications, provided by the
2016 and 2021 WHO CNS guidelines. The glioma type of each sample of TCGA
RNASeq dataset were updated, and the glasso algorithm was applied to each glioma
subgroup. The sets of selected variables were analyzed and used as the starting point
for survival analysis performed with regularized Cox model and consequent patient

stratication.
Our results suggest that the two classication procedures do not provide remarkable
dierences in variable selection. Even if the algorithm identied variables exclusively
related to one classication, the corresponding rankings are low. Moreover, all the
identied hubs are part of the subset of selected features, independently from the
classication. However, comparing the hub subsets, our results highlight that the
two procedures identied dierent key genes, suggesting that the classication could
aect the detection of potential biomarkers specic to each glioma type. In particular,
for GBM and astrocytoma, the 2021 classication provides larger sets of hub genes,
including almost all the 2016 hubs. In addition, our analysis reveals three 2021 hub
genes, one from GBM and two from astrocytoma, having low rankings according to
17the 2016 classication. This seems indicate that grouping the samples following the
2021 guidelines leads to a more comprehensive list of key features.
The statistically signicant stratication of patients into high- and low-risk groups
derived by survival analysis indicate that our selected sets of variables carry enough
information to divide samples into high- and low-risk groups, serving also as validation
of the glasso results. Moreover, most of the variables selected as genes able to describe
survival in case 1 (which took into account all the variables selected by glasso) have also
been pointed out as output in case 2, in which the dataset considered only variables
exclusively selected by each glioma type. This outcome is particularly interesting,
since while the genes commonly selected by all the glioma types could be either related
to specic-glioma mechanisms or general cell functions, the exclusive genes can be
considered more characteristic of the corresponding glioma type. In this light, this
results suggest that variables that have been selected based on their relevance for each
glioma type (diagnostic value), they also hold prognostic information.
The patient stratication into high- and low-risk group derived from survival model
tting is consistent with literature [42], since GBM samples are associated with the
worst survival, and they constitute the major part of the high-risk group. The 2021
classication leads to better results in terms of both distinction with statistical sig-
nicance of low- and high-risk groups, and the association between GBM and poor
survival, given that the percentage of GBM samples in the high-risk group increases
by more than 10% compared with 2016 sample grouping.
As expected, the unsupervised sample grouping into high- and low-risk underlines
the presence of some unconventional associations between glioma subtypes and overall
survival. Based on the 2016 variable selection, the survival returns a high-risk group
containing 179 samples. Despite 83% of them being classied as GBM, few LGG
samples are predicted to have poor survival. If we classify them according to the new
2021 WHO CNS guidelines, we observe that 84% of these samples are diagnosed as
GBM. Similarly, the only GBM sample being part of the 2016-low-risk group presents
IDH-mutation, but no 1p/19q codeletion, which turns out to be astrocytoma in 2021.
Although this result seems to support the idea that the 2021 classication leads to
more consistent survival outcomes, this does not occur. Indeed, even if the number of
LGG in the high-risk group is lower than the one predicted by considering the 2016
classication, there are 10 GBM assigned to the low-risk group. Interestingly, we can
assess that 9 over 10 2021-GBM samples have histological features of LGG. This result
is coherent with other studies that highlight the possibility of glioma samples presenting
IDH mutation (which should be LGG in 2021) associated with poor outcomes, as well
as IDH-wildtype (necessary condition to be GBM) with favorable survival [27, 21]. All
these results suggest that there are still unknown factors inuencing survival, which
could also aect tumor histology.
The literature research on the 37 genes identied as having prognostic relevance
revealed that 34% of them are known to have a role in glioma progression. Other
20% have been identied as key in other cancers, while 17% have been recognized
18as important by in silico analyses on glioma datasets. The remaining 29% features
are not linked to cancer-related processes. The genes not previously investigated in
glioma could be suitable for further investigation. Moreover, the fact that most of
the genes identied in this study either arose from bioinformatic studies on glioma or
are involved in cancer processes supports the necessity of validating them biologically.
Furthermore, network visualization could be a functional tool to disclose unknown
relations and support biological research, allowing the detection of relevant subnetworks
within gliomas types, and fostering validation studies.
5 Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the rst work discussing dierences and similarities be-
tween the two most recent glioma classications in terms of their impact on potential
biomarker identication for each glioma type.
According to our results, transcriptomics data seems to align with the current
changes in glioma classication guidelines, since the new 2021 WHO CNS classication
provides better results in terms of variable selection and identication of key features,
compared with the previous version of 2016.
The survival analysis allows the separation of samples into the high- and low-
risk group, proving that the set of variables we identied carry information also from
the prognostic point of view. The 2021 classication led to better stratication of
patients based on their survival proles, since the percentage of GBM (characterized
for worst prognosis than LGG) in the high-risk group increased compared with the
2016 classication, as expected. Moreover, with our pipeline, we provide a useful way
to disclose unknown gene relations though network visualization.
Overall, our study brings insight into new features with a diagnostic and prog-
nostic value that can be further biologically evaluated. However, the presence of
unexpected associations between glioma types and predicted survival suggests that,
although molecular features are essential in predicting patient survival, histology has
an impact on the risk of death. Therefore, additional eorts are needed to further char-
acterize the heterogeneity of glioma types and improve the classication procedure.
We hope our results motivate the scientic community to further investigate the
role of the genes we identied, intending to improve glioma therapies.

29A Mathematical validation
Mathematical validation of variable selection derived from glasso results has been
performed to appraise the consistency of the solution of the equation (1). Let Dbe
the RNASeq dataset constituted by the subset of selected variables for a given glioma
type. Setting a very low value of the regularization parameter , we can determine a
matrix  Dthat does not lead to further variable selection1. Considering the objective
function as a dierence between two functions of , i.e. F() R(), where F() =
log(det ) tr(S), andR() =jjjj1, we compared the values of Fobtained from
the dataset D(FD), with the one computed from 1000 random variable selections of
the same dimension ( FR). IfFD>FRfor all 1000 random datasets, we can conclude
that the set of selected variables really led to the optimal solution. The results of the
mathematical validation performed for both glioma classications and for each glioma
type are reported in Table 1, together with the xed regularization parameters.
We noticed that, although the optimization results depend on the regularization
termR(), choosing low values of we obtainO(F())O(R()), such that the
regularization term can be ignored.
