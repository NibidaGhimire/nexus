Abstract
Browniansnailswithremovalisaspatialepidemicmodeldeﬁnedasfollo ws. Initially, ahomogeneous
Poisson process of susceptible particles on Rdwith intensity λ >0 is deposited and a single infected
one is added at the origin. Each particle performs an independent st andard Brownian motion. Each
susceptible particle is infected immediately when it is within distance 1 fr om an infected particle. Each
infected particle is removed at rate α >0, and removed particles remain such forever. Answering a
question of Grimmett and Li, we prove that in one dimension, for all va lues ofλandα, the infection
almost surely dies out.

1 Introduction
Susceptible/infected/removed (SIR) models are among the m ost classical in epidemiology. While they
are most commonly studied in a mean-ﬁeld setting, considera ble progress in the analysis of geometric
SIR models for stochastic dynamics witnessing the individu als in the population was made in the past
decades. Given the circumstances (parameter values), the q uestion of utmost importance is whether the
disease almost surely dies out or it survives indeﬁnitely wi th positive probability.
The present paper deals with the Brownian snails with remova l model recently studied by Grimmett
and Li [9]. Before introducing the model formally, let us bri eﬂy discuss related simpler models and
results. The frog model [2,3,15] is a lattice SIR system in which infected particles perform random walks
(in discrete or continuous time) on Zduntil they are removed at rate α(in discrete or continuous time).
Susceptible particles remain immobile until an infected pa rticle visits the site they occupy, at which
point they become infected (and start their own random walk u ntil they are removed). We refer to the
latter feature (susceptible particles not moving) as delay. While it appears harmless from a modelisation
viewpoint, considering a delayed model makes it mathematic ally easier to handle. Similarly, there is a
canonically associated SI model (without removal), obtain ed by taking α= 0. Such models enjoy crucial
monotonicity properties making them easier to study. For in stance, for the frog model without removal,
it is known that the set of infected particles converges to a ( linearly expanding) limit shape [3,16], much
like classical static models such as ﬁrst passage percolati on.
1Similarly to the frog model without removal, a delayed model without removal in continuous space
(where particles perform Brownian motions rather than rand om walks and infections are transmitted
within distance 1) was studied much more recently by Beckman , Dinan, Durrett, Huo and Junge [4],
where it was proved that the set of infected particles also ex hibits a limit shape. Grimmett and Li [9]
investigated the corresponding model of delayed Brownian s nails with removal, showing that it exhibits
a non-trivial phase transition only for dimensions 2 and hig her.
We next turn to models without delay. Among the ﬁrst results i n this direction are the ones of Kesten
and Sidoravicius [10–12] who proved a shape theorem in the ab sence of removal in a discrete space model.
Gracar and Stauﬀer [7] treated this model also in ﬁnite volume . The most recent progress is due to
Dauvergne and Sly [6] who showed that infection progresses l inearly (though without establishing a limit
shape result) also if one allows for diﬀerent speeds for infec ted and susceptible particles, which creates
major diﬃculties. Subsequently, they also treated the corr esponding model with removal for small enough
removal rate αin dimensions d≥2 [5]. In the setting of Brownian snails (with removal and no d elay)
Grimmett and Li [9] only treated the case αlarge enough, again in dimension d≥2.
However, determining whether Brownian snails have a non-tr ivial phase transition in one dimension
remained beyond the scope of [9]. Indeed, in [9, Question D] t hey asked for a solution of this problem,
which was subsequently reiterated in [8, Question 6.1(i)]. Our main result resolves this question by
showing that in one dimension there is no survival regardles s of the value of the removal rate α >0 and
the intensity λof the initial conﬁguration.
Analogues of our result have been proved for the frog model wi th removal [2, Theorem 1.1] and
the delayed Brownian snails model with removal [9, Theorem 1 .2] but not for non-delayed models. In
[5, Remark 1.2], this was claimed also for the discrete space model with removal and without delay,
though the argument is a bit trickier than it appears. To be pr ecise, in the discrete space setting of
[5, Remark 1.2], (2) is imported from [10] (see Appendix A for the continuous space setting), (4), (5)
and (10) are somewhat suggested to hold, while the somewhat s ubtle argument in (8) and (9) is omitted
altogether. Nevertheless, it should be noted that if both ti me and space are discrete, the heuristics
proposed in [5, Remark 1.2] are essentially exhaustive.
1.1 The model
Fixλ,α >0. Consider a Poisson Point Process PonRwith intensity λwith a particle added at 0. At
the beginning, the particle at position 0 is infected and all other particles are susceptible. Each particle
performs an independent standard Brownian motion ( Bp(t))p∈P,t≥0. Infected particles are removed at
rateα(that is, an exponentially distributed amount of time with m ean 1/αafter becoming infected) and
remain removed forever. Susceptible particles become infe cted instantly at the ﬁrst time when they are
at distance at most 1 from an infected particle. As remarked i n [9, Section 2.4], a construction of the
process informally described above can be obtained along th e lines of [10] (also see Appendix A).
It will be convenient for us to encode the process in terms of t he empirical measure of the particles
and their type as follows. For any t≥0, letPt=/summationtext
p∈Pδ(Bp(t),ηp(t)), whereηp(t)∈ S={S,I,R}is the
state (susceptible/infected/removed resp.) at time tof the particle starting at position pin the initial
condition P. We denote by It=/summationtext
p∈P:ηp(t)=IδBp(t)the empirical measure of the infected particles at
timet. We further deﬁne I(t) =It(R) as the number of infections at time t, as well as the leftmost and
rightmost infections L(t) = infsupp( It) andR(t) = supsupp( It), with the convention inf ∅=∞and
sup∅=−∞.
1.2 The result
Our main result establishes that, for any non-degenerate va lue of the parameters, infection eventually
dies out almost surely. In fact, we show that the probability that the infection survives until time Tis
exponentially small.
2Theorem 1. There exists c >0such that, for all suﬃciently large T >0,
P(sup{t≥0 :I(t)>0} ≥T)≤e−cT. (1)
In particular, almost surely there exists T >0such that I(t) = 0for allt≥T.
Remark 2 (Extensions) .While Theorem 1 is stated and proved in the cleanest setting o f Section 1.1, it
readily extends in various ways. A non-unit range of infecti on and diﬀusion coeﬃcient can be obtained
by rescaling space and time, respectively. A drift can be add ed to the Brownian motions by shifting
space linearly with time. Furthermore, it will be clear from the proof that one can allow infection to
be transmitted at ﬁnite rate which may depend on the relative position of the susceptible and infected
particles, instead of instantaneously, as long as the infec tion range is ﬁnite. Indeed, in such models,
infection spreads more slowly than in models where the infec tion rate is inﬁnite and there is no removal,
so AppendixA still applies, whiletherest of theargument do esnot inspectthe exact infection mechanism.
Our technique can likely be adapted to other diﬀusions and suﬃ ciently fast decaying infection rates with
unbounded range (see [9, Theorem 3.6]), but we prefer to avoi d such technical complications. For the
interested reader, we point out that the only model-depende nt spots in the proof are (3), which uses
a very rough Gaussian computation, and Proposition 3. The la tter relies only on the stationarity of a
homogeneous Poisson point process whose points perform ind ependent Brownian motions and its result
can also be recovered in a more robust way via the approach of [ 10], if needed.
2 Proof of Theorem 1
Fixα,λ >0. The proof proceeds as follows. First, we use the model with out removal to restrict our
attention to particles in an interval growing linearly with time. By standard concentration bounds this
implies that only a linear number of particles is relevant. S ince each infected particle typically survives a
time of order 1, most of the time there are at most a bounded num ber of infected particles. Finally, we
deﬁne suitable stopping times allowing us to make independe nt attempts to either remove all the infected
particles, before they infect anyone else, or infect yet mor e particles. In the former case, we are done
(infection dies out), while in the latter case, we arrive at a contradiction with the bound on the number
of infected particles. Next, we turn to the details. Note tha t in the proof of Theorem 1, we often spare
integer parts for the sake of readability.
Linearly localised infection Recall that the Brownian snails model with removal at diﬀeren t values
ofαdoes not enjoy monotonicity in α(note that, while infected snails typically live longer for smaller
values of α, in this setting some of them may also become infected too ear ly and fail to transmit the
infection further). However, if there is no removal at all ( α= 0), it holds that the set of infections at any
given time contains the one for any value of α >0. More precisely, this inclusion holds if we couple the
two processes using the same Brownian motions. We may theref ore use the model without removal as
an upper bound. In Appendix A, we discuss how to adapt the proo f of [4] in order to obtain c1,C1>0
depending on λsuch that for any Tlarge enough
P(E1)≤e−c1TwhereE1=/braceleftBigg
sup
t≤Tmax(−L(t),R(t))≥C1T/bracerightBigg
(2)
for the model without removal (and, therefore, also for the o ne with removal). We have thus localised
infection to an interval of linear size. We next seek to show t hat only linearly many particles enter this
interval.
3Linear number of infections FixTlarge enough. We next compute the expectation of the number
Nof particles p∈ Psuch that min t≤T|Bp(t)| ≤C1T. It is at least 1+ 2 C1T(because of the particles
initially present in [ −C1T,C1T]) and at most

(which is clear from the construction in Appendix A). We may t hus apply a standard concentration result
for Poisson variables to N−1 (see e.g. [1, Theorem A.1.15]) to get
P(E2)≤e−C1TwhereE2={N≥20C1T}. (4)
Thus, so far, we know that only linearly many particles may be come infected.
Frequently bounded number of infections Our next goal is to show that during a linear proportion
of the time, only boundedly many particles are infected. Con sider a truncation of the model in which
only the ﬁrst 20 C1Tinfection events are allowed to occur. More precisely, the p rocess is as above until
the time when the 20 C1T-th particle becomes infected, thereafter infection is no l onger transmitted and
the remaining infections are removed at rate αas usual. Note that on the event Ec

2, the truncation
will not take place until time T. LetI′(t) be the number of infected particles in the truncated proces s
at timet. Then,/integraltext∞

Notice that, on the event Ec

has Lebesgue measure
ℓ(T)≥T/2. (6)
Fixε= 1/(200C1). We next inductively deﬁne a sequence of stopping times at w hichI(t)≤2C2by
setting
τ1= min{t≥0 :I(t)≤2C2}and, for all i≥1,τi+1= min{t≥τi+ε:I(t)≤2C2}(7)
with min ∅=∞. For each i≥1, set
ξi=/braceleftBigg
1 ifτi<∞andP(∃t∈(τi,τi+ε),limθ→t−I(θ)< I(t)| Pτi)≥1/2,
0 otherwise .(8)
In other words, we wait until there are few infections and ass ess whether it is likely that more infections
appear during the following time interval of length ε.1The key idea is to take advantage of the stopping
times when infection is likely to appear in order to contradi ct (4) rather than trying to avoid this scenario.
1Note that almost surely there is no time such that a susceptib le particle is infected and an infected one is removed
simultaneously.
4Too many infections We ﬁrst asses the stopping times τisuch that ξi= 1, that is, it is likely that a
new infection will appear soon. We argue that if many such tim es occur, probably too many infections
will arise, conﬂicting (4). Set i0= 0 and, for every j≥0,
ij+1= min{i > ij:ξi= 1}
with min ∅=∞. We construct a sequence ( Xj)j≥1of Bernoulli random variables as follows. For every
j≥1 such that ij<∞, we deﬁne
Xj=/braceleftBigg
1 if there is t∈(τij,τij+ε) such that lim θ→t−I(θ)< I(t),
0 otherwise ,
and extend the sequence by deﬁning ( Xj)j:ij=∞as a sequence of independent Bernoulli(1 /2) random
variables, whichis alsoindependentfrom( Xj)j:ij<∞. Weremarkthat if ij<∞, thenξij= 1andτij<∞,
soXjis well deﬁned. Moreover, the Markov property and (8) give th atP(Xj= 1|(Xk)k<j)≥1/2 for all
j≥1. Hence, ( Xj)j≥1is stochastically dominates a sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with
parameter 1 /2 and a standard concentration inequality gives

3we have τi≤T−εfor alli≤M−1, since, by (6)
and (7),
T/2≤ℓ(T)≤ε(1+|{i∈N:τi≤T−ε}|).
On the other hand, the event {Ξ≥50C1T}∩Ec
4implies that at least 20 C1Tinfections occur before time

Many chances to extinguish infection Now that we know that Ξ <50C1T, we will recover many

variables with parameter p= 1−(1−e−αε)2C2/2, which is also independent from ( Yj)j:max(i′

Again, the Markov property and (8) give that P(Yj= 1|(Yk)k<j)≤pfor allj≥1. Note that here, we use
that for any conﬁguration P(not necessarily having a particle at the origin) with at mos t 2C2infections
such that the probability of infecting another particle by t imeεis at most 1 /2, the probability that the
5infection dies out completely is at least 1 −p(it suﬃces for all infections to be removed within time ε

A At most linear growth
In this appendix, we discuss the proof of (2). Since the argum ent is quite general, we work directly in
arbitrary dimension d≥1.
Let us begin by introducing the Brownian snails model withou t removal (that is, with α= 0) more
formally. Fix λ∈(0,∞). LetPbe a Poisson point process on C0×Rd, whereC0denotes the space
of continuous functions f: [0,∞)→Rdsuch that f(0) = 0 equipped with the topology of uniform
convergence on compact sets (see e.g. [13, Chap. 2] for backg round on Poisson processes). We refer to
elements of C0×Rdaspossible trajectories and to elements of P(or other Poisson point processes on
the same space) as trajectories . We view the second coordinate of a possible trajectory as it sstarting
point. We take the intensity measure of Pto beWd⊗(λℓ), where Wddenotes the d-dimensional Wiener
measure (which is the distribution of the standard Brownian motion on Rdstarted at 0) and ℓis the
Lebesgue measure on Rd. We further ﬁx an independent d-dimensional Brownian motion B0and set
P0= (P \(C0×B(0,1)))∪{(B0,0)}, whereB(0,1) is the unit ball of Rd. Thus, one obtains P0fromPby
removing the trajectories starting within unit distance fr om the origin, and then adding one trajectory
starting at the origin. We label the trajectories in P0by ((Bi(t))t≥0,xi)∞
i=0. It remains to specify the
state (S or I) of each particle. We set T(0) = 0 and for any positive integer i, we deﬁne
T(i) = inf{t >0 :∃k≥0,∃i0= 0,∃i1,...,∃ik=i,∃0< t1≤t2≤ ··· ≤tk≤t,∀j∈ {1,...,k},
/bardbl(Bij(tj)+xij)−(Bij−1(tj)+xij−1)/bardbl ≤1}.
Thus, the positions of the infected particles at time t≥0 are given by
It={Bi(t)+xi:i≥0, T(i)≤t}.
With this notation, we are ready to state the result we are aft er.
Proposition 3. Letd≥1. For any λ >0strictly smaller than the critical rate for continuum perco lation
with radius 1inddimensions (equal to ∞whend= 1; see[14]), there exist c,C >0such that, for all t
large enough,
P(max{/bardblz/bardbl:z∈It} ≥Ct)≤e−ct.
6While one can probably use the method of [10, Theorem 1] (with a signiﬁcant amount of work, in
particular due to the need of also discretising space and not only time) to prove this fact, and it was more
or less claimed in [9, Section 2.4], there is a more elegant ap proach. It turns out that, once one adopts
the right viewpoint, the proof becomes essentially identic al to the one of [4]. Indeed, [4, Proposition 1.4]
is the analogue of Proposition 3 for the corresponding model with delay (where particles remain immobile
until they are infected). The gist of [4] in our setting is as f ollows.
We start by exploring B0until the time τ= infi≥1T(i) when the ﬁrst infection occurs. Also, reveal
the (random) index ιof the particle which comes at distance 1 from B0(τ) at time τ, together with its
position Bι(τ)+xιat timeτ. Then comes the key point: one considers the random set
X=/braceleftBig
(B,x)∈ C0×Rd:∃t≤τ,/bardblB(t)+x−B0(t)/bardbl ≤1/bracerightBig
of possibletrajectories coming within distance 1 of B0nolater than time τ. We know by construction that
P0∩X={(B0,0),(Bι,xι)}. Therefore, Xis measurable with respect to (the sigma-algebra generated
by)P0∩X, since
τ= min{t≥0 :/bardblBι(t)+xι−B0(t)/bardbl= 1}
is measurable with respect to P0∩X.
We thendeﬁneaPoisson point process P′that is equal to P0outsideXand independentwithintensity/BDX(Wd⊗(λℓ)) inX. Observe that P′is indeed a Poisson point process equal to Pin distribution. To
see this, it suﬃces to note that for any disjoint measurable Y1,...,Y k⊂ C0×Rd, the random variables
|P′∩Yi|=|(P0\X)∩Yi|+|P′∩Yi∩X| (11)
are independent for all i∈ {1,...,k}and have expectations ( Wd⊗(λℓ))(Yi). Moreover, in view of (11),
P′is independent of X, sinceXis measurable with respect to P0∩X. LetP′={(B′
i,x′
i) :i≥0}and
write (B′
−1,x′
−1) = (Bι,xι) and (B′
−2,x′
−2) = (B0,0) for convenience.
We then consider the continuum percolation cluster

translated in time by τand in space to B′
j(τ) +x′
j(note that here we are using the fact that for every
t≥0,{B(t)+x: (B,x)∈ P}is still a Poisson point process on Rdwith intensity λℓ). The Poisson point

j′,x′
j′) :j′∈C})∪{(B′
j,x′
j)}to which we add an

j′∈C∪{−2,−1}, but at distance more than 1 from B′
j(τ)+xj.
One then studies the branching process obtained this way and proves that it grows at most linearly.
Since the only diﬀerence with respect to [4, Section 3 and Appe ndix A] is the use of the space C0×Rd
instead of Rd, we direct the reader to that paper for more details. The only subtlety to account for is the
fact that P(τ= 0) = 0, which is slightly more diﬃcult when all particles mov e, but is proved as in (4).
Remark 4. A similar approach can be used to obtain a somewhat simpler pr oof of [10, Theorem 1].
Finally, let us note that, while Proposition 3 only gives a bo und at a given time, it is not hard to
deduce that P(max{/bardblz/bardbl:∃t′≤t, z∈It′} ≥2Ct)≤e−c′tfor some c′>0, as claimed in (2). Indeed, by a
reasoning similar to (4), if an infected particle is at dista nce 2Ctfrom the origin at some time t′≤t, it
is exponentially unlikely to be within distance Ctof the origin at time t.
