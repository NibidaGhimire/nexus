Abstract
This study discusses the necessity of anisotropic subgrid-scale (SGS) stress in large-eddy simula-
tions (LESs) of turbulent shear flows using a coarse grid resolution. We decompose the SGS stress
into two parts to observe the role of SGS stress in turbulent shear flows in addition to the energy
transfer between grid-scale (GS or resolved scale) and SGS. One is the isotropic eddy-viscosity
term, which contributes to energy transfer, and the other is the residual anisotropic term, which is
separated from the energy transfer. We investigate the budget equation for GS Reynolds stress in
turbulent channel flows accompanied by the SGS stress decomposition. In addition, we examine
the medium and coarse filter length cases; the conventional eddy-viscosity models can fairly predict
the mean velocity profile for the medium filter case and fails for the coarse filter case. The budget
for GS turbulent kinetic energy shows that the anisotropic SGS stress has a negligible contribution
to energy transfer. In contrast, the anisotropic stress has a large and non-dissipative contribution
to the streamwise and spanwise components of GS Reynolds stress when the filter size is large.
Even for the medium-size filter case, the anisotropic stress contributes positively to the budget
for the spanwise GS Reynolds stress. Spectral analysis of the budget reveals that the positive
contribution is prominent at a scale consistent with the spacing of streaks in the near-wall region.
Therefore, we infer that anisotropic stress contributes to the generation mechanism of coherent
structures. Predicting the positive contribution of the anisotropic stress to the budget is key to
further improving SGS models.

2I. INTRODUCTION
Subgrid-scale (SGS, or subfilter-scale) models play a significant role in accurately pre-
dicting the statistics of turbulent flows in large-eddy simulations (LESs). For instance,
eddy-viscosity models provide a statistically accurate energy transfer rate from grid scale
(GS or resolved scale) to SGS. However, an accurate energy transfer rate is only one of the
required conditions for predicting the statistics of turbulent flows. In general, character-
istic quantities other than the energy transfer rate are important in predicting turbulent
flows; for example, the mean SGS shear stress in turbulent shear flows. Several studies
pointed out that the eddy-viscosity models are not necessarily sufficient for predicting both
the energy transfer rate and mean SGS stress in turbulent shear flows [1–3]. Therefore, it is
important to understand the role of SGS stress in addition to energy transfer for the further
development of LES.
Several studies addressed the development of non-eddy-viscosity or anisotropic SGS mod-
els and showed that these models improve the prediction of the statistics of turbulent flows
[4–11]. Specifically, these anisotropic models provide a better prediction even in grid resolu-
tion cases that are coarser than in conventional eddy-viscosity models. Therefore, we infer
that the difference between eddy-viscosity-based and anisotropic models becomes prominent
in coarse grid cases. Analysis using a coarse grid or large filter scale will shed light on the
role of anisotropic SGS stress in LES. Furthermore, the necessity of improving the SGS
model in a coarse grid resolution has recently been discussed for atmospheric turbulence as
the grey zone or terra incognita problem [12].
It is worth noting that some anisotropic models prohibit backward scatter, which is the
local energy transfer from SGS to GS [4–9]. This indicates that additional stress, apart from
energy transfer, can improve the performance of LES. Actually, Abe [13] demonstrated that
the additional stress apart from the energy transfer essentially contributes to the generation
of GS or resolved scale Reynolds shear stress in turbulent channel flows. Based on a similar
analysis, Inagaki and Kobayashi [8] suggested that the amplification of small-scale velocity
fluctuations close to the cut-off scale due to the anisotropic stress contributes to the im-
provement of the prediction of statistics in LES. As suggested by these studies, an analysis
of the budget for the Reynolds stress will shed light on the physical role of anisotropic SGS
stress in a statistical sense.
3In this study, we investigate the budget for GS Reynolds stress in turbulent channel
flows. To clarify the physical role of the anisotropy of SGS stress, we decompose the SGS
stress according to the description by Abe [13]. The eddy-viscosity coefficient is determined
by assuming that all energy transfers between GS and SGS are governed by the eddy-
viscosity term. Residual stress is obtained by subtracting the eddy-viscosity term from
the exact SGS stress. Therefore, the residual stress is apart from the energy transfer.
Because the eddy-viscosity approximation is often referred to as the isotropic model owing
to the scalar coefficient, the residual stress represents the anisotropy of the turbulent velocity
fluctuation in SGS. Such anisotropic stress is essential for predicting the anisotropy of the
SGS dissipation tensor (hereafter often referred to as SGS dissipation, simply), which is the
key ingredient in this study.
The anisotropy of SGS dissipation is rarely considered in the context of SGS modeling [14].
Haering et al. [15] demonstrated that a simple tensor-coefficient eddy-viscosity model can
improve the prediction of SGS dissipation anisotropy induced by anisotropic grids. Marstorp
et al. [4] reported that LES employing anisotropic SGS stress improves the prediction of
the ratio of wall-normal to streamwise components of SGS dissipation when compared with
the eddy-viscosity model in rotating channel flows. In conventional non-rotating channel
flow, Domaradzki et al. [16] and H¨ artel and Kleiser [17] showed that in the energy transfer
between GS and SGS, the streamwise component is dominant and others are negligible in
the near-wall region. As shown later, the anisotropic property of SGS dissipation cannot be
reproduced solely by the eddy-viscosity term even though the total SGS dissipation, which
is the trace part of SGS dissipation tensor, is described adequately by the isotropic eddy
viscosity. Therefore, this study quantifies the importance of the anisotropic SGS stress in
predicting the statistics of turbulent flows in LES.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, we summarize the decomposition of
SGS stress according to the description by Abe [13] and budget equation for GS Reynolds
stress in Sec. II. We also provide a physical interpretation of SGS stress-related terms in the
budget. The numerical results for the budgets in turbulent channel flows are presented in
Sec. III. In Sec. IV, further analysis of the budgets in Fourier space is presented to discuss
the physical role of anisotropic SGS stress in the near-wall region. In addition, we provide
ana priori test of the SGS dissipation based on anisotropic SGS stress using a few existing
model expressions. Conclusions are presented in Sec V.
4II. BUDGET EQUATION FOR GS REYNOLDS STRESS
A. Decomposition of SGS stress
In LES of incompressible flows, the governing equations are filtered continuity and Navier-
Stokes equations:
∂ui
∂xi= 0, (1)
∂ui
∂t=−∂
∂xj(uiuj+τsgs
ij)−∂p
∂xi+∂
∂xj(2νsij), (2)
where ·represents the spatial filtering operation. Here, we assume that the filter and partial
differential operations are always commutative. If the filter and partial differential operations
are not commutative, several additional terms appear in the filtered continuity and Navier–
Stokes equations (see e.g. Ref. [14]), which makes the investigation of the effects of SGS
on GS much more complex. To focus on the role of SGS stress in the governing equations,
we assume the commutativity of filter operation. ui,p, and sij[= (∂ui/∂x j+∂uj/∂x i)/2]
are the GS velocity, pressure divided by the density, and strain-rate tensor, respectively. ν
is the kinematic viscosity. The sole unknown variable in LES is the SGS stress defined by
τsgs
ij=uiuj−uiuj.
To numerically solve Eqs. (1) and (2), we must employ a closed model expression for
τsgs
ij. In contrast, in the analysis based on direct numerical simulation (DNS) data, which is
referred to as the a priori test, we can directly calculate τsgs
ijby explicit filtering. However, in
the case of an a priori test, we cannot assess the amount of SGS stress that can be modeled
in terms of the eddy-viscosity approximation. The inconsistency between the a priori and
a posteriori tests of the SGS model increases the complexity of this issue. The correlation
between SGS stress and strain rate in the a priori test is low [18–20]. Furthermore, abundant
backward scatter events [21, 22] reject the validity of an eddy-viscosity model with a positive
coefficient. Nevertheless, the purely dissipative eddy-viscosity models perform well in several
turbulent flows in the a posteriori test of LES (see Ref. [14]).
The eddy-viscosity term is ideal to achieve numerical stability, although its justification
is still under discussion. In particular, when we employ the scale-similarity model, the
eddy-viscosity term is often employed to compensate for insufficient dissipation [23, 24].
Furthermore, recent studies on anisotropic SGS modeling demonstrated that the employ-
5ment of the additional stress that has no contribution to the energy transfer improves the
prediction of the statistics in LES [4–9]. Therefore, we adopt the following decomposition
of SGS stress by assuming that the eddy-viscosity term governs the energy transfer between
GS and SGS [8, 13]:
τsgs
ij−1
3τsgs
ℓℓδij=−2νsgssij+τani
ij, (3)
where
νsgs=−τsgs
ijsij
2s2, (4)
τani
ij=τsgs
ij−1
3τsgs
ℓℓδij+ 2νsgssij, (5)
ands2=sijsij. According to Abe [13], we refer to τani
ijas the extra anisotropic or simply the
anisotropic term. Based on the definition of eddy viscosity given by Eq. (4), the anisotropic
term does not contribute to the energy transfer between GS and SGS, that is, τani
ijsij=
0. Although this decomposition is arbitrary, this analysis allows us to verify the physical
properties of the anisotropic part of SGS stress, in addition to the energy transfer. The eddy-
viscosity defined by Eq. (4) can be negative, which indicates the local backward scatter of
kinetic energy. However, the average energy transfer rate is almost positive because of
the predominance of forward scatter in turbulent flows. It is worth noting that this eddy-
viscosity does not necessarily predict the mean SGS shear stress in turbulent shear flows even
though it accounts for an accurate energy transfer rate [1–3]. Hence, the present analysis
also provides the difference between the exact mean SGS shear stress and that predicted
only by the eddy-viscosity term based on energy transfer.

referred to as production, dissipation, pressure redistribution, pressure diffusion, turbulent
diffusion, viscous diffusion, SGS dissipation, and SGS diffusion, respectively. Contributions
from SGS stress appear in the SGS dissipation εSGS
ijand diffusion DSGS
ij. Note that SGS
dissipation is not necessarily positive, even for the trace part εSGS(=εSGS
ii/2), in contrast
to the molecular dissipation ε(=εii/2). Negative SGS dissipation is observed near the wall
in turbulent channel flows [16, 17, 25, 26]. In this study, we do not focus on modeling the
eddy viscosity, which predicts the spatial profile of SGS dissipation. Instead, we extract the
physical properties required for anisotropic SGS stress by the decomposition (3) with (4).
This analysis demonstrates the general property of anisotropic SGS stress; that is, it does
not rely on a specific model expression.
C. Decomposition of SGS dissipation
Using Eq. (3), we decompose the SGS dissipation εSGS
ijinto the following forms:
εSGS
ij=εEV
ij−ξAR

. (9b)
We refer to the terms defined in Eqs. (9a) and (9b) as eddy-viscosity dissipation and
anisotropic redistribution, respectively. The eddy-viscosity dissipation εEV
ij(9a) has a form
similar to that of the conventional molecular dissipation εij(7b). Hence, we expect that the
eddy-viscosity dissipation plays a dissipative role similar to the molecular one. In contrast,
the anisotropic redistribution ξAR
ij(9b) plays a different role in contrast to the eddy-viscosity
dissipation (9a) owing to the anisotropy of SGS stress. Therefore, the anisotropy of SGS
stress plays a significant role in predicting turbulent flows when the anisotropic redistribution
contributes significantly to the GS Reynolds stress budget. Similarly, we can decompose the
SGS diffusion DSGS
ij(7h) into eddy-viscosity and anisotropic parts. For simplicity, we discuss
the result of the decomposition of SGS dissipation. The decomposition of SGS diffusion is
briefly discussed in Appendix A.
The naming of anisotropic redistribution is based on the property that τani
ijhas no con-
tribution to the energy transfer between GS and SGS. In addition, we do not refer to this
term as anisotropic dissipation because we expect it to be more prominently non-dissipative
than SGS dissipation εSGS
ij. Exactly speaking, however, the anisotropic redistribution does
not redistribute the energy among the normal stress components, in contrast to the pres-
sure redistribution ΦGS
ij(7c). In other words, the trace of pressure redistribution is exactly
zero ΦGS
ii= 2⟨ptotals′
ii⟩= 0, whereas the anisotropic redistribution is not necessarily trace-
less; that is, ξAR
ii= 2⟨τani
ijs′
ij⟩ ̸= 0 [8]. This non-zero trace emanates from the Reynolds
decomposition; that is,

τani
ijsij

ij
Sij+ξAR
ii/2 = 0 , (10)
and hence ξAR
ii=−⟨τani
ij⟩Sij̸= 0. Here, we used the property τani
ijsij= 0, which is provided
in Sec. II A. ⟨τani
ij⟩Sijrepresents the energy transfer rate between the mean and SGS fields
due to the anisotropic stress. For unidirectional turbulent shear flows as channel flows, it
reads⟨τani
xy⟩∂Ux/∂y/2. When ∂Ux/∂y > 0 and⟨τani
xy⟩<0 as the conventional turbulent shear
stress in shear flows, ξAR
ii>0, thus implying that the trace of anisotropic redistribution is
8productive. Conversely, when ∂Ux/∂y > 0 and ⟨τani
xy⟩>0,ξAR
ii<0, thus implying that the
trace of anisotropic redistribution is dissipative.
D. Budget equation for GS Reynolds stress spectrum
For a further understanding of SGS modeling, an analysis of the energy budget in scale
space is useful. Domaradzki et al. [16] showed that in turbulent channel flows, the local
energy transfer in scale space through the nonlocal wavenumber triad interaction is the
majority in the interscale energy transfer process. This result suggests that the interscale
interaction across the cutoff scale plays a significant role in energy transfer, which should
be implemented in SGS stress. As another approach to investigating interscale interaction,
Cimarelli and De Angelis [26] analyzed the Kolmogorov equation, which is the budget equa-
tion for the second-order velocity structure function, for both unfiltered and filtered velocity
fields. They concluded that to resolve the interscale interaction including the inverse cascade
observed in the spanwise scale, the appropriate filter length scale for eddy-viscosity models
yields ∆+
x<100 and ∆+
z<20 where ∆idenotes the filter length scale for the i-th direction,
xandzare the streamwise and spanwise directions, and the values with a superscript +
denote those normalized by the wall shear stress and kinematic viscosity. In other words,
we have to employ additional stress to the eddy-viscosity term when using a larger filter
length in LES. This limitation of the filter length scale is consistent with the typical grid
resolution for conventional LES employing eddy-viscosity models, ∆+
x<130 and ∆+
z<30
(see Refs. [27–29]).
To investigate the physical role of anisotropic stress and the limitations of eddy-viscosity
models, we also analyze the budget equation for GS Reynolds stress spectrum. We consider
the case in which the xandzdirections are periodic and the ydirection is bounded by
solid walls as turbulent channel flows. We adopt the Fourier transformation in the xandz
directions for the scale decomposition of the flow fields; the discrete Fourier transformation
9of a quantity qand its inverse transformation read
˜q(nx, y, n z) =1
NxNz(Nx,Nz)X
(I,K)=(1,1)q(xI, y, z K) exp[−2πi(nxxI/Lx+nzzK/Lz)], (11a)
q(xI, y, z K) =(Nx/2−1,Nz/2−1)X
(nx,nz)=(−Nx/2,−Nz/2)˜q(nx, y, n z) exp[2 πi(nxxI/Lx+nzzK/Lz)], (11b)
where i =√−1,xI=LxI/N x, and zK=LzK/N z.LiandNiare the length of the
flow domain and grid number in the i-th direction, respectively. When the turbulence
field is statistically homogeneous in the xandzdirections, the second-order correlation
yields ⟨f(xI, y, z K)g(xI, y, z K)⟩=⟨fg⟩(y) =P
nx,nzℜ⟨˜f(nx, y, n z)˜g∗(nx, y, n z)⟩where the
superscript ∗represents the complex conjugate. Hence, the GS Reynolds stress spectrum

III. RESULTS IN TURBULENT CHANNEL FLOWS
A. Numerical setup
We investigate the budget equation for GS Reynolds stress provided in Sec. II B using
the DNS data of the turbulent channel flows. The x,y, and zcoordinates represent the
streamwise, wall-normal, and spanwise directions, respectively. We employed a staggered
grid system and adopted a fourth-order conservative central finite difference scheme for the x
11andzdirections and a second-order conservative finite difference scheme on the non-uniform
grid for the ydirection [32]. Periodic boundary conditions were employed in the xandz
directions and no-slip condition was employed in the ydirection. The second-order Adams-
Bashforth scheme was employed, for time marching. The Poisson equation for pressure was
solved using a fast Fourier transformation. The Reynolds number is set to be Re τ= 400
where Re τ=uτh/ν,uτ(=p
ν|∂Ux/∂y|wall|) is the friction velocity, and his the channel half
width. The computational domain size is Lx×Ly×Lz= 2πh×2h×πhand the number
of grid is Nx×Ny×Nz= 256 ×192×256. The numerical resolutions in each direction are
∆x+= 9.8, ∆y+= 0.34-10, and ∆ z+= 4.9, respectively. Here and hereafter, the values with
a superscript + denote those normalized by uτandν. The statistical average is obtained
over the x-zplane and time. The validation of our simulation is discussed in Appendix B.
To calculate the filtered quantities, we adopted a Fourier sharp-cut filter, which is com-
mutative with a differential operation. Note that in the calculus of GS and SGS dissipation
spectra, Eqs. (14b) and (14g), we have to use the modified wavenumber for ˜∂iowing to
employing a finite difference scheme [32]; namely, for the fourth-order central finite differ-
ence, kmod
x= [27 sin( πnx/Nx)−sin(3πnx/Nx)]/(12∆ x). For simplicity, the filter operation
is applied only in the xandzdirections. In the actual LES or a posteriori tests, the filter
in the wall-normal direction is often applied because the grid size along the wall-normal
direction is coarser than that of DNS. Furthermore, the scale of eddies in the wall-normal
direction is also important to discuss the dynamics of wall-bounded turbulent flows [33].
Thus, the filter in the wall-normal direction can provide physical insight into wall-bounded
turbulent flows. However, if we realize the filter that coincides with the actual LES, we
have to apply the inhomogeneous filter where the filter length changes against the distance
from the wall. This inhomogeneous filter is not commutative with a differential operation
and induces several additional terms which are different from the stress term in the filtered
continuity and Navier-Stokes equations [14]. In the conventional LES, we often ignore such
terms arising from the commutation error and model only the SGS stress or related nu-
merical viscosity. In this study, we focus on the role of SGS stress in the budget for GS
Reynolds stress and its spectrum, which should be reproduced in the actual LES. For this
reason, we apply the filter only in the xandzdirections. When the filter is applied only
in homogeneous directions, the statistical average of the filtered variable yields the same
as that of the unfiltered variable, namely, ⟨q⟩=⟨q⟩. Owing to this property, the second
12moment can be straightforwardly decomposed into three of mean, GS turbulence, and SGS
parts. For example, the statistical average of kinetic energy ⟨uiui⟩/2 is decomposed into
mean UiUi/2, GS turbulence KGS(=⟨u′
iu′
i⟩/2), and SGS ⟨uiui−uiui⟩/2. If we also apply
the filtering in the wall-normal direction, we have ⟨q⟩ ̸=⟨q⟩, and thus the mean of fil-
tered velocity ⟨ux⟩is somewhat smoothed compared with the mean velocity of DNS ⟨ux⟩.
However, in the near-wall to buffer region, LES often predicts the mean velocity profile
well. Therefore, we infer that the interaction between the mean flow and GS turbulent field
through the mean velocity gradient can be reasonably discussed to some extent even if we
apply the filter only in the xandzdirections. To observe the filter-size dependence, we
employed two filter sets, namely, medium-size filter where the set of cutoff wavelength scales
is (λc+
x, λc+
z) = (105 ,52.4) and coarse- or large-size filter where ( λc+
x, λc+
z) = (209 ,105). Here
λα= 2π/k αforα=x, zthat correspond to LES resolutions of (∆ x+,∆z+) = (52 .4,26.2)
and (105 ,52.4), respectively. Strictly speaking, an exact cut-off wavelength is often slightly
shorter than the length of grid size because of dealiasing in a spectral scheme or the accuracy
of the discretization scheme. For example for a fourth-order central finite difference scheme,
spatial differentiation yields the modified wavenumber mentioned above whose modulus is
smaller than the exact wavenumber. In this study, we do not consider such an effective max-
imum wavenumber to simplify the interpretation of the analysis. According to the typical
resolutions referred to in Sec. II D, the eddy-viscosity models can predict the basic statistics
for the medium filter case, whereas the large filter case is outside their range (see also Ap-
pendix C). Hence, by comparing the results of these two filter sizes, we can determine the
physical role of the anisotropic SGS stress.
B. Filter wavelength and GS Reynolds stresses
Figure 1 shows the profiles of each non-zero component of GS Reynolds stress. The profiles
for DNS without filter operation are also plotted. Most of the turbulent velocity fluctuations
are resolved in the GS for the medium filter case. The ratio of KGS(=⟨u′
iu′
i⟩/2 =RGS
ii/2)
to the total turbulent kinetic energy K(=⟨u′
iu′
i⟩/2 =KGS+⟨τsgs
ii⟩/2)) yields approximately

To understand the physical meaning of the filter length, two-dimensional pre-multiplied
spectra of the Reynolds stress are shown in Fig. 2. Here and hereafter, kxandkzdenote
their moduli when considering the statistical values. We chose two heights: the near-wall
region y+≈15 and slightly away from the wall y+≈100(y/h≈0.25). For the medium
filter, almost all the components are well-resolved. The wall-normal component is partially
filtered out in the near-wall region even for the medium filter. The ratio of wall-normal
GS velocity fluctuation to the unfiltered one is less than 80% in y+<50 for the medium
filter case. This may be one of the reasons why the wall-normal velocity fluctuation is often
underestimated in LESs (see Appendix C). To predict the anisotropy in the near-wall region
of shear flows more accurately, a finer grid may be required in the spanwise direction, for
example, ∆ z+<20. The length scale ∆ z+= 20 is comparable to that specified by the

containing scale. In addition, most of the wall-normal and shear stress spectra are contained
in the SGS. Therefore, conventional isotropic eddy-viscosity models are not valid for coarse
filters. Furthermore, in the region slightly away from the wall y+≈100, the wall-normal and
spanwise spectra are partially filtered out, whereas the streamwise and shear stress spectra
are well-resolved. Hence, the SGS anisotropy is significant even in the region slightly away
from the wall in the coarse filter case.
C. Mean SGS shear stress
It is important to verify the mean SGS shear stress profile. In general, it is difficult to
reproduce both the energy transfer rate and mean SGS shear stress using only the eddy-
viscosity term [1–3]. Because the eddy viscosity in this study is determined to reproduce
the energy transfer rate, it does not necessarily predict the accurate mean SGS shear stress.
Figure 3 shows the profiles of mean SGS shear stress in terms of the SGS stress decompo-
sition. For the medium filter, the contribution of anisotropic stress is negligible. Therefore,
the eddy-viscosity models can predict both the energy transfer rate and mean SGS shear
stress for the medium filter case. This result provides an interpretation of why LES with an

eddy-viscosity model works well for the medium grid resolution. In contrast, for the coarse
filter, anisotropic stress is comparable to the eddy-viscosity term. Hence, the anisotropic
stress is necessary for the coarse filter case to predict both the energy transfer rate and mean
SGS shear stress.
D. Budget for GS turbulent kinetic energy
Figure 4 shows the budget for GS turbulent kinetic energy KGS. Each term corresponds
to half of the trace of Eqs. (7a)–(7f), (9a), (9b), and (7h). Here and hereafter, we only show
y+≤200 for the budgets to highlight the near-wall features. The trend of each term of the
budget is almost monotonic in y+>200. The pressure redistribution (7c) is not plotted
because it is traceless. For the conventional unfiltered turbulent kinetic energy budget, the
production almost balances the dissipation in the region away from the wall y+>30 (see e.g.
Ref. [35]). The eddy-viscosity dissipation term also contributes to the budget as an energy
sink for the GS turbulent kinetic energy budget. As expected, the contribution of eddy-
viscosity dissipation becomes dominant for the coarse filter. The anisotropic redistribution
term is negligible for the medium filter. In contrast, this term has a positive value in the
near-wall region for the coarse filter. These results are consistent with the profiles of ⟨τani
xy⟩
shown in Fig. 3. Because the trace of the anisotropic redistribution is given by Eq. (10), it
becomes prominent when the mean anisotropic stress ⟨τani
xy⟩increases. Note that the SGS

is positive at y+≈12 for the coarse filter. Furthermore, the eddy-viscosity dissipation is
also positive at y+≈10, although its value is much smaller than that of SGS dissipation.
The productive contribution or averaged backward energy transfer of SGS dissipation in the
near-wall region has already been discussed [16, 17, 25, 26, 36]. Several studies suggested
a relationship between backward energy transfer and coherent structures observed in the
near-wall region of turbulent shear flows [25, 26, 37, 38]. We discuss this in Sec. IV A.
The anisotropic stress is not necessarily negligible even when the trace of the anisotropic
redistribution term is small when compared with other terms. Figure 5 shows the profiles
of the normal components of anisotropic redistribution. For the medium filter, the wall-
normal and spanwise components are almost canceled out. For the coarse filter, the positive
contributions of the streamwise and spanwise components increase at y+≈20. These two
components contribute positively to the GS turbulent kinetic energy budget in the near-wall
region as shown in Fig. 4(b). In addition, the spanwise component is dominant in 50 < y+<
100 for the coarse filter. Notably, the spanwise component of the anisotropic redistribution
is always positive for both filter sizes. In turbulent channel flows, the production term is
zero in the budget for the spanwise component of GS Reynolds stress RGS
zz; that is, PGS
zz= 0.
The productive term, which is the pressure redistribution in the conventional unfiltered
budget, plays a significant role in the budget for spanwise GS Reynolds stress. In the next
subsection, we examine the budget for the normal components of GS Reynolds stress.

E. Budget for GS Reynolds stress
In this study, we focus on the budget only for the normal components of GS Reynolds
stress. A detailed analysis of the contributions of anisotropic SGS stress to the shear stress
budget was already demonstrated by Abe [13], which concluded that anisotropic SGS stress
is essential to reproduce the productive contribution to the shear stress budget.
1. Streamwise component
Figure 6 shows the budget for the streamwise component of GS Reynolds stress. The
basic profiles of each term are almost the same as those of the GS turbulent kinetic energy
budget shown in Fig. 4. The pressure redistribution term, which transfers the energy from
the streamwise component to the other two components, is an exception. The intensity
of the pressure redistribution is small when compared to the eddy-viscosity dissipation for
the coarse filter. However, this does not imply that the redistribution among the normal
components is negligible because pressure redistribution is an essential source term in the
wall-normal and spanwise components.
2. Wall-normal component
Figure 7 shows the budget for the wall-normal component of GS Reynolds stress. The
pressure redistribution has a large productive contribution except for the close vicinity of

the wall y+<10. The viscous and eddy-viscosity dissipations are the leading terms of the
negative contribution for both filter sizes. For the coarse filter, the eddy-viscosity dissipation
is dominant, as seen in the budget for the streamwise component. In the near-wall to buffer
region y+<100, the SGS diffusion term also contributes significantly to the budget and
plays a key role in counterbalancing the sum of the pressure and turbulent diffusions. The
details of SGS diffusion are provided in Appendix A. The anisotropic redistribution has
a large negative contribution compared to the viscous and eddy-viscosity dissipations in
the near-wall region y+<50. Conventional eddy-viscosity models may account for this
negative contribution in the a posteriori tests, although the intensity could be small. Thus,
the leading productive and dissipative contributions to the wall-normal GS Reynolds stress
can be reproduced by the pressure redistribution, viscous dissipation, and eddy-viscosity
dissipation terms.
3. Spanwise component
Figure 8 shows the budget for the spanwise component of GS Reynolds stress. The
pressure redistribution has a leading productive contribution similar to the wall-normal
component shown in Fig. 7. In addition, the viscous and eddy-viscosity dissipations are also
the leading terms of the negative contribution. An important finding is that the anisotropic
redistribution is always positive in the spanwise GS Reynolds stress budget as shown in
Fig. 5. Furthermore, the sum of eddy-viscosity dissipation and anisotropic redistribution

is positive near the wall y+≈20 for both filter sizes. The intensity of the anisotropic
redistribution is relatively small compared to that of the pressure redistribution for the
medium filter. In contrast, the anisotropic redistribution is comparable to the pressure
redistribution in the near-wall to buffer region y+<100 for the coarse filter. Therefore,
this positive contribution of anisotropic redistribution is indispensable to the generation
mechanism of the spanwise velocity fluctuation in the GS or the resolved scale for the coarse
filter case. Even for the medium filter, we infer that the lack of anisotropic redistribution will
lead to an underestimation of the GS spanwise velocity fluctuation (see also Appendix C).
The underestimation of GS spanwise velocity fluctuation may alter the structure of the
wall-bounded turbulent shear flows, for example, coherent structures in the near-wall region.
Hamba [38] demonstrated that the conditional averaged velocity field regarding the inverse
cascade of the spanwise velocity fluctuation represents the streamwise elongated vorticity
structure, which represents the coherent structure in wall-bounded turbulent shear flows. A
relationship between backward scatter in terms of kinetic energy and coherent structures
has also been suggested [25, 26, 37]. The present analysis suggests that the anisotropic SGS
stress reproducing the productive contribution to the spanwise GS Reynolds stress budget
is key to improving SGS models.
21IV. DISCUSSION
In Sec. III E, we demonstrated that the anisotropic redistribution term contributes pos-
itively to the streamwise and spanwise components of GS Reynolds stress. Conventional
eddy-viscosity models cannot represent the productive contribution. In this section, first,
we discuss the physical interpretation of the productive contribution in terms of the bud-
get equation for GS Reynolds stress spectrum. Second, we perform an a priori test of the
anisotropic redistribution term based on several existing model expressions.
A. Budget for GS Reynolds stress spectrum
Several studies have discussed the relationship between inverse cascade and coherent
structures in wall-bounded turbulent shear flows [25, 26, 37, 38]. Spectral analysis is a
fundamental tool used to study the effect of each term in the budget on structures rep-
resented by specific scales [30, 31]. A representative of the near-wall structure is streaky
structures whose spanwise spacing or wavelength is λ+
z∼100 [39, 40]. According to the
self-sustaining process of wall-bounded turbulent shear flows, streaky structures are gener-
ated by streamwise vortices, and the breakdown of the streaks generates the source modes
of the nonlinear interaction that generates the streamwise vortices [41, 42]. In particular,
the generation of streamwise vortices does not agree with the dissipative property of eddy
viscosity [38]. To determine the relationship between these processes and the productive
contribution of anisotropic redistribution in the streamwise and spanwise components of
GS Reynolds stress, we examine the budget for EGS
xx(kx) and EGS
zz(kz). Here and hereafter,
we simply denote EGS
ij(kx) =P
nzEGS
ij(kx, kz) orEGS

EGS
zz(kz) itself does not directly represent the vorticity, the spanwise velocity fluctuation
accompanied by the nonzero spanwise wavenumber is related to the streamwise vortices as
˜ωx(kz) =∂˜uz(kz)/∂y−ikz˜uy(kz).

filter sizes, the production term contributes significantly in the low-wavenumber region.
For the medium filter, the gain by the interscale interaction is balanced with the loss by
viscous dissipation and pressure redistribution in the high-wavenumber region. In contrast,
for the coarse filter, the anisotropic redistribution has a positive contribution in the high-
wavenumber region k+
x>0.01 (λ+
x≲600). The contribution of anisotropic redistribution
to the high-wavenumber mode was already highlighted by Inagaki and Kobayashi [8] in
the low-Reynolds number case. They suggested that in coarse LES using only the eddy-
viscosity term, the absence of enhancement of small scales causes a longer streamwise velocity
correlation in the xdirection than that of filtered DNS. In other words, the anisotropic
term other than eddy viscosity is needed in coarse LES to predict the streamwise velocity
correlation in the xdirection comparable to that of filtered DNS.
To see the details of the gain in the small scales, we examine the two-dimensional spectra
of the interscale transfer and anisotropic redistribution in the kx-kzplane for the coarse filter
case. Figure 10 shows the contributions of interscale transfer and anisotropic redistribution
aty+≈15. The interscale transfer term transports EGS
xx(kx, kz) from the region k+
x<0.01
and 0 .02< k+
z<0.06 (λ+
x≳600 and 100 ≲λ+
z≲300) to the modes with a relatively large
spanwise length scale where k+
z<0.03 (λ+
z≳200). In contrast, the anisotropic redistribution
term contributes to the high-wavenumber region k+
x>0.015 ( λ+
x≲400). Therefore, we can
interpret that the anisotropic redistribution plays a key role in the amplification of small-

lies on a scale close to the cutoff λ+
z∼100∼λc+
zfor the coarse filter. Focusing on k+
x>0.015
andk+
z>0.04 (λ+
x≲400 and λ+
z≲160), the anisotropic redistribution has a slightly larger
contribution to the budget than interscale transfer. This generation of a small streamwise
length scale mode with λ+
z∼100 is consistent with the streak breakdown. We infer that
this positive contribution of anisotropic redistribution can improve the performance of LES
in the way that it reproduces the streak breakdown-like contribution.
242. Spanwise component
Figure 11 shows the budget for the spanwise component of GS Reynolds stress spectrum
in the spanwise wavenumber space EGS
zz(kz) aty+≈15. The interscale transfer is negative
atk+
z= 0.04 and positive in k+
z<0.02 for both filter sizes, which represents the inverse
transfer of EGS
zz(kz) in the spanwise scale. The inverse transfer of the spanwise velocity
fluctuation has already been identified by Hamba [38], although it has been demonstrated
in the streamwise scale space. In addition, the inverse transfer of kinetic energy in the
spanwise scale has already been discussed [26, 43]. For the medium filter, the interscale
transfer changes the sign at k+
z≈0.08 (λ+
z≈80) in the high-wavenumber region. This
critical length scale is larger than that observed in the analysis based on the Kolmogorov
equation [26] or the scale energy density in terms of a filter function [43]. They suggested
that the critical length is r+
z≈20 where rzdenotes the distance between the two velocity
fields composing the scale. Note that the wavelength should be twice the distance between
the two velocity fields; that is λz= 2rz. The shift in the critical length of interscale transfer
is caused by the absence of small scales, owing to the filtering operation. Nevertheless, we
can infer that a large amount of the interscale interaction in the budget of EGS
zz(kz) including
inverse transfer is resolved in the medium filter case. In contrast, for the coarse filter, the
forward cascade of EGS
zz(kz) is completely unresolved. The unresolved interscale interaction
should be converted to the τsgs
ℓℓ-related part of the pressure redistribution, eddy-viscosity
dissipation, and anisotropic redistribution. Part of the forward cascade may convert to eddy-
viscosity dissipation. However, for both filter sizes, the positive contribution of anisotropic
redistribution is larger than the loss via eddy-viscosity dissipation in the entire wavenumber.
In addition, the anisotropic redistribution is comparable to the pressure redistribution for
the coarse filter.
To observe the relationship between the coherent structures and positive contributions
to the budget, we examine the two-dimensional spectra of the pressure and anisotropic
redistributions in the kx-kzplane. Figure 12 shows the two-dimensional spectra of the
pressure and anisotropic redistributions at y+≈15. The pressure redistribution is negative
in the region k+
x<0.005 and k+
z>0.04 (λ+

redistribution attenuates the streamwise vortices. The anisotropic redistribution is positive
in this region and peaks at k+
z≈0.05 (λ+
z≈130), which is consistent with the typical
spanwise spacing of streaks λ+
z∼100. Therefore, we infer that the positive contribution
of anisotropic redistribution to the spanwise GS Reynolds stress spectrum is related to the
generation of streamwise vortices in the self-sustaining process [41, 42]. In other words, the
generation mechanism of streamwise vortices through the SGS stress vanishes if we employ
only the eddy-viscosity model in the LES. As we can see from Fig. 12(c), the anisotropic
redistribution has a large value at a low- kxregion, whereas it is large even at a relatively
high- kzregion. Therefore, we can infer that the filter in the zdirection is more critical than
that in the xdirection for the anisotropic redistribution. The anisotropic redistribution is a
significant source term at this scale even in the medium filter case. Hence, by employing a
proper anisotropic SGS stress reproducing the productive contribution to the spanwise GS
Reynolds stress, the prediction of the statistics in LES for the coarse-to-medium filter cases
26can be improved.
B.A priori test of anisotropic redistribution term
A classical idea for implementing backward scatter in LES is stochastic modeling [44].
Langford and Moser [45] demonstrated that the force from SGS stress is mostly stochastic
in their analysis of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. They suggested that the SGS model
may only be able to estimate the average energy transfer rate from GS to SGS because
of its stochastic nature. However, the stochastic approach cannot predict the productive
contribution to the GS Reynolds stress budget; that is, even if we add the stochastic forcing
term aito the filtered Navier-Stokes equations (2), its contribution to the budget is always
zero⟨u′
iaj⟩= 0 because of its stochastic nature. Therefore, a deterministic model must be
employed to reproduce the positive contribution to the GS Reynolds stress budget.
We examine the performance of several model expressions for the anisotropic SGS stress
in terms of an a priori test of the anisotropic redistribution. In this study, the anisotropic
stress is assumed to have no contribution to the energy transfer between GS and SGS,
according to Abe [6, 13]. Similarly, we examine fundamental models based on the strategy
proposed by Abe [6]. Namely, we adopt the following two models for anisotropic stress:
τani
ij=τsgs
ℓℓτa
ij|tl+ 2νasij
τa
mm, τa
ij= (ui−bui)(uj−buj), (19)

α∂ui
∂xα∂uj
∂xα, (20)
where νa=−τa
ijsij/(2s2) for both models, which is introduced to remove energy transfer
through τa
ij. The first model (19) is the scale-similarity model for the SGS Reynolds term
(ui−ui)(uj−uj)≃(ui−ui)(uj−uj) [23], although the repeated filter is replaced with the
test filter denoted by b·. The filter length for the test filter is set to twice that of the filter ·;
namely,b∆/∆ = 2. The model (19) is employed in the stabilized mixed model [6, 7] with the
modeled transport equation of the SGS kinetic energy τsgs
ℓℓ/2. The second model (20) is the
Clark term, which is the leading term in the Taylor expansion of the sum of Leonard and cross
terms [46]; that is uiuj−uiuj+ui(uj−uj)+(ui−ui)uj≃P
α∆2
α(∂ui/∂x α)(∂uj/∂x α)/12+
O(∆4). Inagaki and Kobayashi [8] examined these two models in an a posteriori test of
turbulent channel flows. They found that the first model provides a better result than the
second because small-scale velocity fluctuation is significantly enhanced in the first one.
27In addition to these two models, we also examine the following quadratic nonlinear model
based on the velocity gradient according to the explicit algebraic SGS stress model [4, 5]:
τani
ij=−τsgs
ℓℓsimwmj+sjmwmi
s2,wij=1
2∂ui
∂xj−∂uj
∂xi
. (21)
This model does not contribute to the energy transfer without any artificial treatments
because ( simwmj+sjmwmi)sij= 0. We set the arbitrary numerical coefficient to unity.
We can examine other models, including other normalizations, such as the linear Clark
model where the coefficient τsgs
ℓℓ/τa
mmis replaced with a constant or some other nondimen-
sional function. In addition, to remove the energy transfer by the anisotropic term, we may
be able to construct treatments other than νasij. In this study, we restrict ourselves our
examination to the existing model expressions.
It is worth examining the profiles of the anisotropic redistribution term when employing
the commonly used eddy viscosities in LES because the definition of eddy viscosity given by
Eq. (4) is an ideal one. Then, we also examine the anisotropic redistribution term by using
the eddy viscosity based on the DSM approach [47, 48]; namely, we calculate the anisotropic
stress (5) by using the following eddy viscosity
νsgs=C∆2√
2s2, C = max⟨LijMij⟩S
2⟨MℓmMℓm⟩S,0
, (22)
instead of using Eq. (4). Here, Lij=duiuj−buibuj,Mij=b∆2p
2bs2bsij−∆2\√
2s2sij, and⟨·⟩S
represents the averaging over the x-zplane. We clip the negative eddy viscosity similarly to
that in a posteriori tests of DSM. In contrast to the anisotropic stress based on Eq. (4), that
based on Eq. (22) allows the energy transfer between GS and SGS. When the anisotropic
redistribution based on Eq. (22) (hereafter referred to as AR-DSM) becomes negligibly small,
we can infer that the DSM predicts well the interaction between the GS velocity fluctuation
and SGS even in the a posteriori test. In other words, when the AR-DSM significantly
contributes to the budgets, we can infer that the anisotropic stress is necessary even when
we employ a conventional eddy-viscosity model in a posteriori tests. Furthermore, when the
contribution of AR-DSM is positive in the budgets, it cannot be modeled in terms of the
eddy-viscosity assumption.
Figure 13 shows the a priori prediction of the normal components of the anisotropic
redistribution. We refer to the models provided in Eqs. (19), (20), and (21) as SGS-Reynolds,
Clark, and SW, respectively. For reference, we also plot models (19) and (20) without the

mm) where they are allowed to contribute to the
energy transfer including backward scatter. For the streamwise component, all three models
predict a positive contribution, although they fail to predict a negative contribution observed
in fDNS in the vicinity of the wall. The SGS-Reynolds model provides a profile most similar
to the fDNS, whereas the Clark model shows a different profile. The models without the
νaterm provide a strongly negative profile that is far from that of the fDNS. The profile
of AR-DSM is rather similar to that of EV dissipation in Fig. 6(b). Namely, it is almost
negative except near a positive peak at y+≈10. The value of AR-DSM at y+≈40 is
about −0.02, which is the half of EV dissipation of fDNS there (see Fig. 6(b)). Note that
the anisotropic redistribution of fDNS is negligibly small at the point, and thus the total
dissipation rate of RGS
xxdue to the SGS stress is twice that estimated by DSM in the a priori
test. In other words, the eddy viscosity based on the DSM is less dissipative than the ideal
29one given by Eq. (4).
The wall-normal component shown in Fig. 13(b) is well predicted by all models including
those without the νaterm. The profile of AR-DSM also agrees with that of fDNS based
on Eq. (4) qualitatively. For the spanwise component shown in Fig. 13(c), the SW model
provides a different sign than the fDNS does, which indicates that it attenuates the span-
wise GS velocity fluctuation. The SGS-Reynolds and Clark models succeed in predicting a
positive profile observed in the fDNS, although their intensity is small. In contrast to the
Clark model, the SGS-Reynolds model can provide a positive contribution without the νa
term. The positive value of AR-DSM is smaller than that of fDNS based on Eq. (4) be-
cause the eddy viscosity based on the DSM is less dissipative than that given by Eq. (4) as
mentioned above. If we employ a sufficiently dissipative eddy-viscosity model, the positive
contribution of anisotropic redistribution becomes large because the sum of EV dissipa-
tion and anisotropic redistribution terms is positive at y+≈20 for the fDNS as shown in
Fig. 8. Therefore, we can infer that regardless of the choice of the eddy-viscosity model,
the anisotropic stress has a significant contribution to the budgets even when we employ a
conventional eddy-viscosity model in a posteriori tests of coarse grid LES.
In general, the models with the νaterm provide better results than those without it.
Although the νaterm is an artificial term introduced to remove energy transfer, it can
improve the prediction of the statistics. However, we do not consider that the models with
νaterm are always superior to other models in predicting the budget. Furthermore, in the
a posteriori test, we must determine the closed expression of νsgswithout using DNS data.
The a posteriori performance of the model depends on the combination of the models of
νsgsandτani
ij. The main conclusion of this study is that the anisotropic stress that predicts
a positive contribution to the spanwise GS velocity fluctuation is key to improving SGS
models.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have investigated the budget equation for grid-scale (GS or resolved scale) Reynolds
stress in turbulent channel flows. In the analysis, we have decomposed the subgrid-scale
(SGS) stress into two parts: the isotropic eddy-viscosity term, which governs energy transfer
between GS and SGS, and the anisotropic term, which is separated from the energy transfer.
30According to this decomposition, the SGS dissipation is decomposed into eddy-viscosity
dissipation and anisotropic redistribution terms. To clearly observe the role of the anisotropy
of SGS stress, we have employed a coarse-size filter in addition to a medium-size filter. The
filter length is chosen such that the conventional eddy-viscosity models can fairly predict
the mean velocity profile for the medium filter case, whereas it fails for the coarse filter case
(see Appendix B).
The contribution of anisotropic redistribution to the budget of GS turbulent kinetic en-
ergy for the medium filter is negligible, whereas in the coarse filter, it has a small but
positive contribution. A similar effect has been observed for the streamwise component of
GS Reynolds stress. For the wall-normal component of GS Reynolds stress budget, the
anisotropic redistribution is negative in the entire region for both filter sizes. In contrast,
for the spanwise component of GS Reynolds stress budget, the anisotropic redistribution is
always positive for both filter sizes. Furthermore, the SGS dissipation, which is the sum
of eddy-viscosity dissipation and anisotropic redistribution, is also positive in the near-wall
region. For the coarse filter case, the contribution of anisotropic redistribution is compara-
ble to that of pressure redistribution. Therefore, anisotropic SGS stress is indispensable for
reproducing the generation of GS spanwise velocity fluctuation for LES using a coarse grid
resolution.
It has been suggested that the positive contribution of SGS dissipation to the bud-
get is related to the coherent structures in the near-wall region of turbulent shear flows
[25, 26, 37, 38]. To determine the relationship between coherent structures and positive con-
tribution of anisotropic redistribution to the budget, we have performed a spectral analysis
of the GS Reynolds stress budget. For the coarse filter case, the anisotropic redistribu-
tion is positive in a relatively small-scale region in the near-wall region of the budget for
the streamwise component of GS Reynolds stress spectrum. This trend is consistent with
the streak breakdown process in the self-sustaining process of wall-bounded turbulent shear
flows [41, 42]. In the budget for spanwise GS Reynolds stress spectrum in the near-wall re-
gion, the anisotropic redistribution has a positive contribution where the streamwise length
scale is large and the spanwise length scale is close to the typical spacing of streaks. The
spanwise velocity fluctuation accompanied by a nonzero spanwise wavenumber is related to
streamwise vortices. Therefore, we can infer that the positive contribution of anisotropic
redistribution to the spanwise GS Reynolds stress is related to the generation of streamwise
31vortices in the self-sustaining process [41, 42]. Thus, this study suggests that the anisotropic
part of SGS stress is responsible for the generation of coherent structures in wall-bounded
turbulent shear flows.
We have performed an a priori test of several existing models of anisotropic stress in
terms of anisotropic redistribution. Among them, the model expression employed in the
stabilized mixed model [6] seems to be the best. However, the intensity of the spanwise
component is small. In addition, the artificially introduced part that removes the energy
transfer due to the scale-similarity model contributes to the improvement of the profile of
anisotropic redistribution. A quadratic nonlinear model based on the velocity gradient [4, 5]
cannot reproduce the positive contribution to spanwise GS Reynolds stress. In the future,
we intend to develop a model that predicts all the components of anisotropic redistribution.
In conclusion, this study has suggested that anisotropic SGS stress reproducing a positive
contribution to the GS Reynolds stress budget is key to improving SGS models. This
viewpoint can be a novel guiding principle in SGS modeling, particularly for coarse grid
cases.
In this study, we have not considered the filter in the wall-normal direction. When we
apply the filter in the wall-normal direction, the velocity gradient in the vicinity of the wall
is smoothed. Therefore, the interaction between the mean and turbulent fields should be
changed. To discuss the physics of coarse LES based on the DNS in more detail, we have to
consider wall-normal filtering. However, to realize the filter that coincides with the actual
LES, we have to apply the inhomogeneous filter where the filter length changes against the
distance from the wall. This inhomogeneous filter is not commutative with a differential
operation and induces several additional terms which are different from the stress term in
the filtered continuity and Navier-Stokes equations [14]. We have to assess the effect of such
terms arising from the commutation error. Furthermore, in wall-bounded turbulent flows,
the interaction between near-wall small eddies and the bulk flow is also important [33].
The physics of wall-normal filtered velocity fields and its subgrid-scale modeling should be
discussed in a future study.

These two terms are referred to as eddy-viscosity and anisotropic stress diffusions, respec-
tively.
Figure 14 shows the profiles of decomposed SGS diffusion terms. For the streamwise
component, the eddy-viscosity diffusion (EV) provides a profile similar to SGS diffusion
itself. However, the anisotropic stress diffusion (AS) also has a value comparable to that
of the eddy-viscosity term and slightly alters the profile of SGS diffusion. The wall-normal
component of SGS diffusion is determined by anisotropic stress diffusion, whereas the eddy-
viscosity diffusion is negligible. For the spanwise component, the anisotropic stress diffusion
provides a profile similar to that of SGS diffusion. The eddy-viscosity diffusion has the
opposite sign to that of SGS and anisotropic stress diffusions. However, for the spanwise
component, the contribution of SGS diffusion to the budget is negligible when compared with
the other terms as shown in Fig. 8. In contrast, the SGS diffusion contributes significantly
to the budget in the near-wall region for the wall-normal component as shown in Fig. 7.
Therefore, anisotropic SGS stress is also important to predict SGS diffusion, particularly for
the wall-normal component.

Appendix B: Validation of DNS
Figure 15 shows the comparison between the present DNS and existing ones performed
by Moser et al. [49] and Abe et al. [50]. The database of the nearest Reynolds number
is chosen. Note that Abe et al. [50] used the fourth-order finite difference in the xand
zdirections and the second-order finite difference in the ydirection, which are the same
condition as our code, whereas Moser et al. [49] used the spectral discretization. The mean
velocity profiles are almost consistent for all codes. For the Reynolds stress, the present DNS
slightly overestimates the streamwise component in 50 < y+<250. However, the near-wall
region seems to be well resolved. Therefore, we infer that we can analyze the physics of
this flow by our present simulation, although the resolution is slightly coarser than that of
references.

Appendix C: LES results of reference filter sizes
To observe the resolution dependence of eddy-viscosity models in the a posteriori test,
we performed LES using the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) [47, 48]. The numerical
method and Reynolds number are the same as the DNS provided in Sec. III A. We chose a grid
resolution corresponding to the selected filter lengths. Namely, we performed the medium
(∆x+,∆z+) = (52 .4,26.2) and coarse (∆ x+,∆z+) = (105 ,52.4) cases. We additionally
performed a fine case with (∆ x+,∆z+) = (26 .2,13.1) to observe the detailed dependence on
resolution. The grid number in the ydirection is fixed at Ny= 96 for all the cases. The
near-wall region is well resolved as ∆ y+<1 for the first grid from the wall, although the
resolution is slightly coarser than that of DNS. The test filter operation used to evaluate the
eddy viscosity in the dynamic model is calculated by retaining the first-order in the Taylor
expansion (see Ref. [8]) and is applied in all three directions. The filter length for the test
filter is set to twice the grid width in each direction.

with that for DNS.
Figure 16 shows the mean velocity profile for the LES of DSM in comparison with that for
DNS. Both the fine and medium grid cases predict the mean velocity of the DNS efficiently,
whereas the coarse grid case overestimates it. Thus, we can conclude that the medium grid
resolution is sufficient for predicting the mean velocity profile in turbulent channel flows.
Figure 17 shows the profiles of GS Reynolds stress for the LES of DSM in comparison with
those for DNS and filtered DNS (fDNS). The fine grid case predicts all the nonzero compo-
nents of GS Reynolds stress efficiently, although the wall-normal and spanwise components
are slightly underestimated. In contrast, the medium grid case overestimates the streamwise
component and underestimates the wall-normal and spanwise components. These trends are
often observed in the LES of turbulent channel flows and are emphasized in the coarse grid
case. The analysis described in Secs III and IV suggests that this issue can be resolved by
employing an appropriate anisotropic SGS stress. The medium grid case also overestimates
the shear component. However, the mean velocity is comparable to that of the DNS owing
to the relatively small SGS stress (the figure is not shown).
