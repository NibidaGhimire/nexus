arXiv:2301.11702v1  [math-ph]  27 Jan 2023FROM PARTICLE SYSTEMS TO THE BGK EQUATION
PAOLO BUTT `A, MARIO PULVIRENTI, AND SERGIO SIMONELLA
Abstract. In [3] the authors introduced a kinetic equation (the BGK equa-
tion), eﬀective in physical situations where the Knudsen nu mber is small com-
pared to the scales where Boltzmann’s equation can be applie d, but not enough
for using hydrodynamic equations. In this paper, we conside r the stochastic
particle system (inhomogeneous Kac model) underlying Bird ’s direct simula-
tion Monte Carlo method (DSMC), with tuning of the scaled var iables yielding
kinetic and/or hydrodynamic descriptions. Although the BG K equation can-
not be obtained from pure scaling, it does follow from a simpl e modiﬁcation
of the dynamics. This is proposed as a mathematical interpre tation of some
arguments in [ 3], complementing previous results in [ 8,7].
1.Introduction
In 1953 Bhatnagar, Gross and Krook [ 3] proposed a new kinetic equation giving
a tool of analysis, more eﬃcient than the Boltzmann equation when t he Knud-
sen number is small compared to the macroscopic scales, but not sm all enough
to neglect the typical kinetic behaviour in favour of the hydrodyna mic description
given by the Euler equations. Hydrodynamics deals with the slow evolu tion of
ﬁelds parametrizing the local equilibrium, which is typically established in a (much
shorter) kinetic scale of time. Maintaining the description given by th e Boltzmann
equation, as far as practical questions are in focus, we are led to p erform complex
dynamical calculations (e.g., numerically) to obtain precise informatio n on such
local equilibria. One is tempted to simplify this task, replacing the two- body col-
lision by an instantaneous thermalization on a local Maxwellian, constr ucted with
the empirical parameters given by the dynamics itself. The equation for the one-
particle distribution function f=f(x,v,t) proposed in [ 3] reads (neglecting mean
ﬁeld eﬀects such as electric ﬁelds and external forces)
(∂tf+v·∇xf)(x,v,t) =̺(̺Mf−f)(x,v,t), (1.1)

Here, we ﬁx the space dimension d= 3, (x,v) denotes position and velocity of a
typical particle, and tis the time. The Maxwellian Mfhas hydrodynamic param-
eters (density, mean velocity and temperature) obtained from loc al averages of f
itself.
It turns out that ( 1.1) has the same qualitative hydrodynamic behaviour of the
Boltzmann equation, although the details of the interaction do not a ppear anymore
in the evolution. In practice, ( 1.1) is not used to give a better approximation to
the hydrodynamics, but, with respect to the Boltzmann equation, it is a simpler
and more ﬂexible tool to perform computations [ 12,23].
We do not review here in any detail the very extensive literature (ma thematical
and applied) concerning BGK models. This includes numerical methods , hydro-
dynamic limits (see [ 22], or [4] for a more recent contribution), analysis of non-
equilibrium steady states (as in [ 24,10,16]), or applications to gas mixtures (e.g.,
[1,6,2]), to name a few topics only.
The scope of the present paper is to suggest a mathematical deriv ation of ( 1.1)
in terms of a minimal modiﬁcation of a stochastic particle model, introd uced in
Section2(aspatiallyinhomogeneousKacmodel), whichiscommonlyusedinkinetic
theory for the justiﬁcation of Monte Carlo numerical schemes (su ch as the DSMC)
in suitable scaling limits.
In two recent papers [ 8,7] the convergence of ad hoc stochastic particle systems
to the solutions of the BGK equation ( 1.1) has been proved. Such particle systems
are very diﬀerent from the microscopic dynamics introduced below. Yet another,
two-species particle system yielding the linear and homogeneous BGK equation
rigorously has been recently studied in [ 17].
The BGK equation is frequently used in the physics community as an eﬃ cient
tool of computation, while the mathematical community considers it mostly as a
toy model. We believe that the BGK equation has interesting aspects from the
point of view of mathematical physics, which would deserve further investigation.
We hope our discussion to be a step in this direction.
The present analysisis purely formal. A rigorousapproachwould req uire consid-
erable additional work starting, ﬁrst of all, from constructive exis tence and unique-
ness theorems for the solution of Eq. ( 1.1). At the moment, such results are avail-
able only when the ﬁrst ̺on the right-hand side of ( 1.1) is replaced by a constant
[19,20] (although they can be extended to the casewhen ̺is replacedby a bounded
function λ(̺)>0, and this is a reasonable physical assumption).
2.Basic particle systems and their kinetic limits
LetT3
ℓbe the 3-dimensional torus of side ℓ. We consider a system of Niden-
tical particles in T3
ℓand denote by ZN= (XN,VN) a conﬁguration of the system,
whereXN= (x1,...,x N)∈(T3
ℓ)NandVN= (v1,...,v N)∈(R3)Nare the po-
sitions and velocities of the particles, respectively. We shall also use the notation
ZN= (z1,...,z N) withzj= (xj,vj). The particles move accordingto the following
stochastic dynamics. They are moving freely until a random Poisson time of inten-
sity scaling asN(N−1)
2, when a pair of them is extracted with an equal probability
scaling as2
N(N−1). If the particles of such pair are at a distance less than one, they
perform an elastic collision with a random impact parameter ω. Otherwise, nothing
happens. More precisely, if Φ = Φ( ZN) is a test function on the state space, theFROM PARTICLE SYSTEMS TO THE BGK EQUATION 3

Finally,B >0 is chosen as the cross-section of the Maxwell molecules with angula r
cutoﬀ for which /integraldisplay
dωB(ω;V) = 1.
Up to now we are arguing in terms of microscopic variables, in which the sizeℓ
of the conﬁguration space T3
ℓis very large. Introducing now the space-time scale
parameter ε=ℓ−1>0, we pass to macroscopic variables
x→εx, t→εt,
which belong to the unit torus T3
1=:T3. In the low-density regime, one assumes
ε2N= 1. (2.1)
In the macroscopic variables, the generator takes the form
LmΦ(XN,VN) =VN·∇XNΦ(XN,VN)+LintΦ(XN,VN),
where

is an approximation of the delta function. The formal link with the Bolt zmann
equation is explained next.
Consider a symmetric probability distribution WN(ZN,t) solution to the master
equation (forward Kolmogorov equation),
(∂t+VN·∇XN)WN(ZN,t) =LintWN(ZN,t). (2.2)
From this we can obtain a hierarchy of equations for the marginals as sociated to
WN. In particular, denoting by fN
1andfN
2the one and two particle marginals,
the ﬁrst hierarchical equation is

IfWNis initially chaotic, namely WN(ZN,0) =f⊗N
0(ZN), assuming that in the
limitN→ ∞propagation of chaos occurs at any positive time and taking εas
in (2.1), from ( 2.3) we formally obtain the Boltzmann equation. A mathematical
rigorization of this argument is not obvious at all1.
In spite of the presence of the factor ε2= 1/Nin the interaction operator, what
we are dealing with is far from a mean-ﬁeld model. Actually, the model is rather
intractableboth atthe mathematical andat the practicallevel, at least atthe scales
of time of interest in the applications. It is indeed close to the more fu ndamental,
Hamiltonian system of deterministic particles following the Newton’s law .
The BGK equation cannot follow directly from the previous model, not even
modifying the scaling relation ( 2.1). In fact, when
εαN= 1 for α∈(2,3] (2.4)
we obtain hydrodynamic equations for the slow time evolution of the ﬁ elds which
parametrize the local equilibria.
Notice that, in the scaling ( 2.1), the average number of particles falling in the
ballBε(x1) of radius εaroundx1iso(1), so that it is diﬃcult to ﬁgure out the
instantaneous thermalization which is present in the BGK model. Ther efore, a nat-
ural proposal is a mean-ﬁeld particle model in which either ϕε=ϕis independent
ofεor it approximates the delta function much more gently. We will do so b y
introducing a partition of the torus in square cubes, exactly in the s pirit of classical
numerical codes [ 5].
3.The mean-field stochastic particle system
Let{∆}be a partition of T3in cubic cells ∆ with equal volume |∆|. Consider
a system of Nparticles evolving freely in T3up to an exponential time of suitable
intensity. At such time, a pair of particles is extracted randomly. If they fall in
the same cell ∆, they may perform a collision as in the basic system of S ection2.
Otherwise, nothing happens.
As before, ZN= (XN,VN) = (z1,...,z N) denotes a conﬁguration of the system,
beingzi= (xi,vi) position and velocity of the i-th particle. The generator of this
process reads (Φ = Φ( ZN) a test function)

whereχi,j= 1 ifiandjbelong to the same cell and 0 otherwise. As before, we de-
note byWN(ZN,t) a symmetric probability distribution solution to the associated
master equation,

1One can apply the method of Lanford for mechanical systems [ 14] to obtain a short time
validity result working in L∞(T3×R3) (and assuming fast velocity decay). Unfortunately, we
cannot approach the problem in L1(T3×R3) because, due to the presence of ϕε, the collision
operator has an L1-norm diverging with ε.FROM PARTICLE SYSTEMS TO THE BGK EQUATION 5
There exist several variants of such spatially inhomogeneous, mea n-ﬁeld particle
models with collisions. For instance, Cercignani’s model of soft spher es [11,15] in
which, at variance with the above proposal, the impact vector ωis not random; we
refer to [ 18] for an account of related mathematical results.
This process yields formally the Boltzmann equation in the combined limit N→
∞and|∆| →0. Indeed, let WN(ZN,t) be a symmetric probability distribution
solution to the master equation ( 3.2). IffN

Therefore, under the assumption of propagation of chaos, lettin g ﬁrstN→ ∞and
then|∆| →0 we recover the Boltzmann equation in the weak form (assuming the
existence of a global solution and its stability with respect to a regula rization via
a cell partition).
3.1.BGK equation. To derive, at least formally, the BGK model, we introduce
a modiﬁcation of the stochastic process ( 3.1) in which, inspired from the original
paper [3], we reinforce the interaction leaving ﬁnite the mean-free path. To do
this, we introduce a time τ, which will eventually converge to 0, and prescribe the
dynamics in each time interval [2 nτ,2(n+1)τ],n∈N, according to the following
rules. All the particles move freely in the time interval [2 nτ,(2n+ 1)τ], while,
during the time interval [(2 n+1)τ,(2n+2)τ], the particles contained in each cell ∆
evolve according to the homogeneous Kac dynamics with probability τN∆/Nand
nothing happens with probability 1 −τN∆/N, whereN∆denotes the number of
such particles. This allows to preserve the mean free path ﬁnite, be ingτproperly
small. Moreover, we increase the number of collisions introducing a tim e-scale
parameter εin the Kac dynamics.
The solution WN(t) to the corresponding master equation (hereafter, we will
often omit the explicit dependence of WNon the variables ZN) is thus given by a
product formula,
WN(nτ) = (S0(τ)K(τ))nWN(0),
