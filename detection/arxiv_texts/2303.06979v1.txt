Abstract. In this paper, we establish some Stein-Weiss type inequalities with gen eral ker-
nels on the upper half space and study the existence of extremal f unctions for this inequality
with the optimal constant. Furthermore, we also investigate the r egularity, asymptotic es-
timates, symmetry and non-existence results of the positive solut ions of the corresponding
Euler-Lagrange integral system. As an application, we ﬁnally derive some Liouville type
results for the Hartree type equations in the half space.
1.Introduction and main results
The research of inequality problems have received a great deal of a ttention in recent years.
The inequalities such as Sobolev inequality, Hardy-Littlewood-Sobole v inequality (HLS for
short) and Stein-Weiss type inequality play an essential role in the th eory of partial diﬀer-
ential equations and geometric analysis. For instance, the HLS ineq uality is widely used to
investigate the qualitative properties and classiﬁcation of solutions . Moreover, the HLS in-
equalitymeansthatsharpSobolevinequality, aswellasGross’slogar ithmicSobolevinequality,
which are key ingredients in the study of Yamabe problem and Ricci ﬂo w problem [ 31]. Let
us ﬁrst review the classical version of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev in equality, which is found by
Hardy, Littlewood and Sobolev in [ 33,48].
Proposition 1.1. Let1<p, q′<∞,0<µ<n,f∈Lp(Rn), andg∈Lq′(Rn). Then there
exists a sharp constant C(p,q′,µ,n)such that

If one ofporq′equals 2 or p=q′, the existence of extremals to the HLS inequality
with the optimal constant was discussed by Lieb [ 40]. Moreover, Lieb considered the value
of the sharp constant to inequality ( 1.1). However, for p/\e}atio\slash=q′, either the sharp constant

or the extremals is not known. Later, with the aid of the reﬂection p ositivity of inversions
in spheres, Frank and Lieb [ 28] explored the best constant and extremals to this inequality
in the special case p=q′=2n
2n−µ. It was also studied by Carlen and Loss [ 6] via the
competing symmetry argument. For the case µ=n−2, Carlen et al. [ 7] simpliﬁed the proof
and obtained the sharp version of inequality ( 1.1) withn≥3. More generally, Frank and
Lieb [30] considered the sharp constant of inequality ( 1.1) under the more general parameters
by using the rearrangement argument. The HLS inequality on the He isenberg groups was
ﬁrstly established in [ 27] by Folland and Stein, and the authors in [ 29] studied the sharp
version of this inequality in the special case. Dou and Zhu [ 23] investigated the reversed
HLS inequality. The reversed HLS inequality was proved by Dou, Guo a nd Zhu [ 22] via
the subcritical argument. By virtue of the layer cake representa tion, Ngˆoand Nguyen [ 49]
employed a new method to prove the reversed HLS inequality.
Stein and Weiss in [ 39,47] established the Stein-Weiss type inequality,
ˆ

p. It is well known that, for the case p<q, Lieb [40] proved that the
extremals for this inequality can beobtained with the restriction α,β≥0, and he also studied
the non-existence of extremal functions for inequality ( 1.2) in the case p=q. Moreover, the
same result as Lieb’s was obtained by Herbst [ 37] in the case µ=n−1,p=q= 2,α= 0 and
β= 1. While in [ 4,5], Beckner established a new equivalent formulation to study the bes t
constant of the inequality with p=q. For the case p/\e}atio\slash=q, the author further constructed the
estimatesofinequality ( 1.2)withthebestconstantin[ 5]. Later, byapplyingtheconcentration
compactness principle, Chen, Lu and Tao [ 8] classiﬁed the extremal functions for inequality
(1.2) under the hypothesis p<qandα+β≥0. In particular, the author in [ 8] generalized
the results to the Heisenberg groups. It is worth mentioning that H an et al. [ 36] derived the
Stein-Weiss type inequality on the Heisenberg group via the weighted integral operators. In
addition, Chen et al. [ 10] considered the reversed Stein-Weiss type inequality. Furthermo re,
the Euler-Lagrange equations related to the HLS and Stein-Weiss t ype inequality have also
attracted a lot of interest. On one hand, for the Euler-Lagrange equation related to HLS
inequality ( 1.1), the authors in [ 16] precisely classiﬁed the positive solutions to this integral
systems via moving plane argument and regularity lifting technique. O n the other hand,
the authors in [ 14] studied the property of positive solutions of the Euler-Lagrange system
corresponding to Stein-Weiss inequality ( 1.2). Furthermore, Bebernes et al. [ 3] studied the
asymptotics of positive solutions of the weighted integral system. For recent development and
applications of HLS and Stein-Weiss type inequalities, we refer to [ 42,51] and the references
therein.
In fact, many people are also interested in the extremal functions and sharp constant of
the integral inequalities on upper half space. In [ 34], Hang, Wang and Yan ﬁrstly established
the following integral inequality with harmonic kernel,

q′= 1. Actually, inequality ( 1.3) can be regarded
as Carleman’s inequality in the higher dimension, and its implies the sharp isoperimetric
inequality [ 35]. The authors considered the existence of extremal function for inequality
(1.3) through the method of symmetrization and the concentration co mpactness principle,
and they also discussed a sequence of qualitative properties of ext remal functions including
regularity and symmetry. Later, Chen [ 13] generalized the above inequality to the more
general inequality ( 1.3) with poly-harmonic extension. More precisely, Chen obtained the
following integral inequality on the upper half space,
/ba∇dblPµf/ba∇dblLnp

is the poly-harmonic extension operator. Moreover, the author c lassiﬁed the positive ex-
tremalsviatherearrangement methodinthecase p=2(n−1)
2n−2−µ. Furthermore, DouandZhu[ 24]
explored the sharp HLS inequality on the half space. With the help of R iesz’s rearrangement
technique, they proved the existence of extremals and computed explicitly the sharp constant.
Recently, Gluck [ 32] obtained the following sharp inequalities with the a family of kernels on
the upper half space

It’s worth showing that, this kernel Kincludes the Riesz kernel and the classical Poisson
kernel. By a subcritical method, Gulck computed the best constan t for a family of HLS type
inequalities ( 1.4), and the author gave a precise classiﬁcation of the related extre mals via the
method of moving sphere. Liu [ 44] generalized the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality with
general kernel in the conformal invariant case for all critical indic es. The reverse inequalities
on the upper half spaces are also widely studied. In [ 20], the authors proved the reversed
Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality with extended kernel K. For the doubly weighted case,
the Stein-Weiss type inequality on the half space was established by D ou [21], the author also
studied the existence of extremal functions. When the kernel fu nction in ( 1.3) is replaced
by the fractional Poisson kernel, Chen, Lu and Tao [ 12] investigated the following inequality
with the double weights,

2. By applying the rearrangement approach and Lorentz
interpolation inequality, they studied the existence of extremals of the sharp constant for
inequality ( 1.5). Moreover, they explicit classiﬁed the extremals of this inequality v ia the
regularity lifting argument and Pohoˇ zaev type identity. Especially, if α=β= 0 in (1.5),
the optimal inequality with the fractional Poisson kernel was estab lished by Chen et al. [ 9].
Meanwhile, Chen and his collaborators [ 11], Tao [50] considered the reversed Stein-Weiss type
inequality on the upper half space respectively.
In thispaper, we aredevoted to study theexistence of extremal functions oftheStein-Weiss
type inequality with the optimal constant with a general kernel in th e half space Rn
+, that is
to generalize the results obtained by Gluck in [ 32] to the double weighted case and to classify
all positive extremal functions of Euler-Lagrange equations corr esponding to this inequality.
First of all, we will investigate the Stein-Weiss type inequality with a gen eral kernel. The
ﬁrst main result of this paper is the following integral inequality.

Next, based on symmetric rearrangement inequality, we shall prov e that the existence of
extremal functions to inequality ( 1.7).

satisfying /ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp(∂Rn

+)=C(n,p,q′,α,β,λ,µ ). Moreover,
if(f(y),g(x))is a pair of maximizer of inequality (1.7), thenf(y)is radially symmetric and
monotone decreasing about the origin, and there exists some positive constant c0such that
g(x) =c0V(f)(x).
Furthermore, we will study the properties of these extremal fun ctions. For this goal, we
may maximize the following functional
J(f,g) =ˆ

under the assumption /ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp(∂Rn

plier theorem, we can deduce the following integral system with doub le weights

In particular, we assume that u=c1fp−1,v=c2gq′−1,q0=1

suitable constants c1andc2in (1.12), the system can be rewritten as

By applying the regularity lifting arguments, we can derive the regula rity results of the
positive solutions for system ( 1.13) under the integral assumption.

Next, we are going to explore the asymptotic behavior of the positiv e solutions for system
(1.13). In light of the regularity theorem, we derive the following result.
Theorem 1.5. Suppose that 0< α,β < n ,0< µ < n −2λandp0,q0>1. Let(u,v)∈

In the spirit of inequality ( 1.7) and the integral assumption, we will apply the method of
moving plane in integral form in [ 17,18] by Chen et al. to study the symmetry property of
the solutions.
Theorem 1.6. Assume that 0< α,β < n ,0< µ < n −2λ,0< p0,q0<∞. If(u,v)∈

Finally, as a special case, our results can be applied to the study of t he following integral
system with single weight

v(x) =ˆ

+.(1.14)
By the Pohoˇ zaev identity, we study the necessary condition for the existence o f non-trivial
solutions for the single weighted system ( 1.14).
Theorem 1.7. Assume that 0< p0<∞,0< q0<∞and0< µ < n −2λ. Let(u,v)∈

Then it must hold thatn−1−α

Clearly, according to the above theorem, we have the following Liouv ille type result for
nonnegative solutions of the single weighted integral system ( 1.14).

where the parameters λ,α,µ,β and the functions G,F,f,g will be given speciﬁc conditions
later. It’s well-known that, Hartree type equation is an essential e quation in mathematics
and physics for the study of the Hartree-Fock model. It is also wide ly used in Bose–Einstein
condensates theory to study how to avoid collapse phenomena. Mo reover, the boson star is
used to describe the source of dark matter in classical quantum me chanics. Then problem
(1.15) plays an important role in development of Black Hole theory. For con venience, the
reader may see [ 38,41] and the references therein for more backgrounds about the Ha rtree
type equations.
In term of the Hartree type equations, the qualitative properties of solutions such as sym-
metry, monotonicity and non-existence have received a great dea l of interest in the last years.
For the symmetry and monotonicity results, by applying the various versions of the method
of moving plane, Lei [ 43], Du and Yang [ 26] ﬁnished the classiﬁcation of positive solutions for
Hartree type equation with critical exponent in the whole space. In [19], the authors estab-
lished the same non-existence results for Hartree type equation w ith the boundary conditions
on the half space. As an application of inequality ( 1.7), we are ready to study the mono-
tonicity and non-existence results of positive solution for problem ( 1.15) via moving plane
argument. In order to present our main result precisely, we ﬁrstly give the deﬁnition of weak
solution to the Hartree type equations ( 1.15).
Deﬁnition 1.9. We call that u∈W1,2

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we mainly c onsider the sharp
Stein-Weiss type inequality with a general kernel on the upper half s pace. Then we apply
the Riesz’s rearrangement inequality and Lorentz norm to obtain th e existence of extremals
for this inequality. In Section 3, by applying the regularity lifting argu ment and the method
of moving plane in integral form, we obtain the qualitative properities of the non-negative
solutions to the integral system with the double weights. In Section 4, by using the Pohoˇ zaev
identiy, we shall show that the necessary condition for the existen ce of solutionsof the single
weighted integral system. In the last section, we study the weak s olutions to Hartree type
equation and prove the symmetry and non-existence results.

In this section, we will investigate the Stein-Weiss type inequality ( 1.7) and the existence
of extremal functions for the sharp constant C(α,β,µ,λ,p,q′,n). For the sake of simplicity,
we ﬁrstly introduce some symbols by deﬁning

2.1.Stein-Weiss type inequality. In this subsection, we will use the following integral

By applying the above Lemma, we are ready to complete the proof of Theorem 1.2.
Proof of Theorem 1.2.Without loss of generality, we may suppose that function fis
positive. In addition, we consider the double weighted integral oper ator related to a general
kernel as follows
Pλ(f)(x) =ˆ
∂Rn
+Pλ(x,y,µ)f(y)dy.
Obviously, we note that inequality ( 1.7) is equivalent to the following inequality,
/ba∇dblPλ(f)|x|−β/ba∇dblLq(Rn
+)≤C(n,α,β,λ,µ,p,q′)/ba∇dblf|y|α/ba∇dblLp(∂Rn
+).
Sinceq >1, we may split the integral items into the following three parts, that is
/ba∇dblPλ(f)|x|−β/ba∇dblLq(Rn

Firstly, we estimate Pλ,1. From the deﬁnition of Pλ,1, we get

one only need to show that W(x) andU(y) satisﬁes ( 2.2). In fact, since α <n−1

Next, we consider Pλ,2. Noticing that |y| ≥2x, we know |y−x| ≥|x|
2. SettingW(x) =
|x|(−β+λ)qandU(y) =|y|(µ+α)pin (2.3), we know

We only need to check that W(x) andU(y) satisﬁes the condition ( 2.4). Sinceβ <n

R>0 we have

|x|≥RW(x)dx=ˆ
|x|≥R|x|(−β+λ)qdx=ˆ

=C(n,αµ,p)R(µ+α)p(1−p′+n−1).
Combining the above estimates, it’s easy to ﬁnd the condition ( 2.4) holds.
Finally, we estimate Pλ,3. By virtue of|x|
2<|y|<2|x|andα+β≥0, it follows that
|x−y|α+β<3α+β|y|α+β≤3α+β2β|x|β|y|α.STEIN-WEISS TYPE INEQUALITY 11

Together with the results in [ 32], we deduce
Pλ,3≤C(n,α,β,λ,µ,p,q′)/ba∇dblf|y|α/ba∇dblq

Therefore, the proof is completed. /Box
2.2.The extremal functions for inequality (1.7).In this subsection, we will prove the
existence of extremal functions for inequality ( 1.7) which was obtained in the previous sub-
section. More precisely, we point out that thestudy of the existen ce of the extremal functions
of the sharp constant is related to the following variational problem
C(α,β,µ,λ,p,q′,n) := sup/braceleftBig
/ba∇dblV(f)/ba∇dblLq(Rn

We shall exploit that the existence of maximiziers to the above supre me problem via the Riesz

Clearly, for 1 ≤p≤ ∞, given some positive functions f,gandh, then the following Riesz
rearrangement inequality holds (See [ 2,39])
I(f,g,h)≤I(f∗,g∗,h∗), (2.9)
withI(f,g,h) :=ˆ
Rn

∂Rn
+f(x)g(x−y)h(y)dxdy.
In the following, we are ready to investigate the existence of the ex tremal functions.
Proof of Theorem 1.3.Suppose that {fj}jis a maximizing sequence of the maximizing
problem ( 2.8), i.e.
/ba∇dblfj/ba∇dblLp(∂Rn
+)= 1 and lim
j→+∞/ba∇dblV(fj)/ba∇dblLq(Rn
+)=C(α,β,µ,λ,p,q′,n).12 X. LI, Z. SHEN, M. SQUASSINA, AND M. YANG
It follows from ( 2.9) that
/ba∇dblf∗

+)=/ba∇dblfj/ba∇dblLp(∂Rn
+)= 1,and lim
j→+∞/ba∇dblV(fj)/ba∇dblLq(Rn
+)≤lim
j→+∞/ba∇dblV(f∗
j)/ba∇dblLq(Rn
+),
sinceα,β≥0. As a consequence, we know that {fj}jis a positive radially non-increasing
sequence. Next we take any f∈Lp(∂Rn
+) and setfκ
j=κ−n−1
pf(y
κ) withκ>0. It’s suﬃce to
ﬁnd that
/ba∇dblfκ
j/ba∇dblLp(∂Rn
+)=/ba∇dblfj/ba∇dblLp(∂Rn
+)and lim
j→+∞/ba∇dblV(fκ
j)/ba∇dblLq(Rn
+)≤lim
j→+∞/ba∇dblV(fκ
j)/ba∇dblLq(Rn
+),
which implies that/braceleftbig
fκ

jis still a maximizing sequence to problem ( 2.8). Furthermore, we
write
e1:= (1,0,...,0)∈Rn−1, Aj:= sup
κ>0fκ
j(e1) = sup
κ>0κ−n−1
pfj/parenleftBige1

By direct calculation, we get
0≤fj(y)≤Aj|y|−n−1

n−2Aj. (2.10)
Moreover, according to the Marcinkiewicz interpolation [ 45,46] with (1.8), we can deduce the
following identity
/ba∇dblV(f)/ba∇dblLq(Rn
+)≤C(α,β,µ,λ,p,q′,n)/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp,q(∂Rn
+).
Thus, by means of the above inequality, we have
/ba∇dblV(fj)/ba∇dblLq(Rn
+)≤C(α,β,µ,λ,p,q′,n)/ba∇dblfj/ba∇dblLp,q(∂Rn

which immediately indicates that Aj≥c0for some positive constant c0.
On one hand, by choosing κj>0 satisﬁesfκj
j(e1)≥c0. We replace {fj}jwith/braceleftbig
fκj
j/bracerightbig
j, and
the latter still recorded as {fj}j, then for any j, we have {fj}j≥c0. For another things, for
anyR>0, it holds that

Based on the above arguments, we get

According to Lieb’s results based on the Helly theorem as in [ 40], we infer that there exists a

It’s clear that for |y| ≤1 and/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp(∂Rn

In view of the assumptions of Theorem 1.3, it’s easy to ﬁnd that the above inequality is ﬁnite.
Therefore, according to the dominated convergence theorem, f orx∈Rn
+, we deduce that
lim
j→+∞V(fj)(x) =V(f)(x).
By virtue of the Brezis-Lieb Lemma, we obtain
lim

Sincep<qandf/\e}atio\slash= 0, we deduce that /ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp(∂Rn

thatfis a maximizer to the problem ( 2.8). this proof is completed. /Box
3.Qualitative analysis of the positive solutions
In this section, we study the qualitative properties of positive solut ions to the integral equa-
tions (1.13). More precisely, we are ready to obtain the regularity, asymptot ic behaviors and
symmetry. First of all, we introduce some basic deﬁnitions. Suppose thatVis a topological
vector space, and we deﬁne two fundamental norms /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblXand/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblYonV,
/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblX,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblY:V→[0,∞].
Let
X:={v∈V:/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblX<∞},Y:={v∈V:/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblY<∞}.
We recall that the operator T:X→Y
•is named to be contracting if for any f,h∈X, there exists some constant ̺∈(0,1)
such that
/ba∇dblT(f)−T(h)/ba∇dblX≤̺/ba∇dblf−h/ba∇dblY.
•is named to be shrinking if for any h∈X, there exists some constant δ∈(0,1) such
that
/ba∇dblT(h)/ba∇dblX≤δ/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblY.
Clearly, it is not diﬃcult to show that, a linear shrinking operator must be contracting.
Next, we recall the classical regularity lifting lemma (See [ 15]), which will plays an essential
role in our discussion.14 X. LI, Z. SHEN, M. SQUASSINA, AND M. YANG
Lemma 3.1. [15] LetTbe a contraction map from X→XandY→Y,f∈Xand there
exists a function g∈X∩Ysuch thatf=Tf+ginX. Thenf∈X∩Y.
Proof of Theorem 1.4.For any constant A>0, we deﬁne
uA(y) =/braceleftBigg

0,otherwise,vA(x) =/braceleftBigg
v(x),|v(x)|>Aor|x|>A,

Furthermore, we may deﬁne the operator T:Lr(∂Rn
+)×Ls(Rn
+),
T(h1,h2) = (T1(h2),T2(h1))
with the norm /ba∇dbl(h1,h2)/ba∇dblr,s=/ba∇dblh1/ba∇dblLr(∂Rn

(u,v) =T(u,v)+(F,G).STEIN-WEISS TYPE INEQUALITY 15

3.2.Symmetry via the moving plane argument. In this subsection, we will prove the
symmetry of positive solutions under the integral conditions. In or der to apply the moving
plane argument, we give some basic notations. For any τ∈R, one write
yτ= (2τ−y1,...,yn−1), xτ= (2τ−x1,...,xn), u(yτ) =uτ(y), v(xτ) =vτ(x),

SincePλ(xτ,yτ,µ) =Pλ(x,y,µ) andPλ(x,yτ,µ) =Pλ(xτ,y,µ), it’s not diﬃcult to ﬁnd that

Proof of Theorem 1.6.We divide the proof into two steps.
Step 1. We claim that for τsuﬃciently negative, there holds
uτ(y)≥u(y), vτ(x)≥v(x),∀x∈Σx,τ, y∈Σy,τ. (3.8)
Let
Σu
y,τ={y∈Σy,τ|u(y)>uτ(y)},Σv
x,τ={x∈Σx,τ|v(x)>vτ(x)}.
Thus, we will show that for τsuﬃciently negative, the sets Σv
y,τand Σu
x,τmust have measure
zero.
For anyx∈Σv
x,τandy∈Σu
y,τ, since|xτ|<|x|, we know from ( 3.6)
u(y)−uτ(y)≤ˆ
Σx,τ|y|−α(Pλ(x,y,µ)−Pλ(xτ,y,µ))/parenleftbig
vq0(x)|x|−β−vq0
τ(x)|xτ|−β/parenrightbig
dx
≤ˆ
Σvx,τ|y|−αPλ(vq0(x)−vq0
τ(x))dx.
Applying Mean Value Theorem, we get
u(y)−uτ(y)≤q0ˆ
Σvx,τ|y|−αPλ(x,y,µ)vq0−1(x)(v(x)−vτ(x))dx.
Similarly,
v(x)−vτ(x)≤p0ˆ
Σuy,τ|y|−αPλ(x,y,µ)up0−1(y)(u(y)−uτ(y))dy.
Using the H¨ older inequality and Theorem 1.2in the above inequalities, we obtain
/ba∇dblu−uτ/ba∇dblLp0+1(Σuy,τ)≤C/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblq0−1
Lq0+1(Σx,τ)/ba∇dblv−vτ/ba∇dblLq0+1(Σvx,τ), (3.9)
and
/ba∇dblv−vτ/ba∇dblLq0+1(Σvx,τ)≤C/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblp0−1
Lp0+1(Σy,τ)/ba∇dblu−uτ/ba∇dblLp0+1(Σuy,τ). (3.10)20 X. LI, Z. SHEN, M. SQUASSINA, AND M. YANG
In view of ( u,v)∈Lp0+1/parenleftbig
∂Rn
+/parenrightbig
×Lq0+1/parenleftbig
Rn
+/parenrightbig
, forτsuﬃciently negative, it holds that
/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblLq0+1(Σx,τ)≤1
2,/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblLp0+1(Σy,τ)≤1
2,
which indicates that
/ba∇dblu−uτ/ba∇dblLp0+1(Σuy,τ)= 0,/ba∇dblv−vτ/ba∇dblLq0+1(Σvx,τ)= 0. (3.11)
Therefore, we deduce that Σu
y,τand Σv
x,τmust be empty set. This implies that ( 3.8).
Step 2. Inequality ( 3.8) provides a starting point to move the plane Tτ. Furthermore, we
move the plane Tτfrom−∞to the right as long as ( 3.8) keeps. one can denote
τ0= sup{τ|uρ(y)≥u(y),vρ(x)≥v(x),ρ≤τ,∀y∈Σy,τ,x∈Σx,τ}.(3.12)
Assume that τ0<0, then we will show that the solution uandvmust be symmetric and
monotone about the limiting plane, Namely,
uτ0(y)≡u(y), vτ0(x)≡v(x),∀y∈Σy,τ0,x∈Σx,τ0. (3.13)
Suppose for such a τ0, on Σ y,τ0and Σ x,τ0, we get
u(y)≤uτ0(y), v(x)≤vτ0(x),butu(y)/\e}atio\slash=uτ0(y), v(x)/\e}atio\slash=vτ0(x).(3.14)
We will show that the plane can be moved further to the right. To be p recise, there exists
an positive parameter εsuch that for any x∈Σx,τandy∈Σy,τ,
u(y)≤uτ(y),v(x)≤vτ(x),∀τ∈[τ0,τ0+ε), (3.15)
which would contradict with the deﬁnition of τ0.
Combining with the ﬁrst step and ( 3.14), we know that u(y)<uτ0(y) andv(x)<vτ0(x) in
the interior of Σ y,τ0and Σ x,τ0respectively. Moreover, we deﬁne
Σ/tildewidev
x,τ0={x∈Σx,τ0|v(x)≥vτ(x)},Σ/tildewideu
y,τ0={y∈Σy,τ0|u(y)≥uτ(y)}.
Therefore, it’s easy to ﬁnd that Σ/tildewidev
x,τ0and Σ/tildewideu
y,τ0have measure zero, and lim τ→τ0Σu
y,τ⊂Σ/tildewideu
y,τ0,
limτ→τ0Σv
x,τ⊂Σ/tildewidev
x,τ0. Furthermore, By virtue of ( u,v)∈Lp0+1/parenleftbig
∂Rn
+/parenrightbig
×Lq0+1/parenleftbig
Rn
+/parenrightbig
, we can
select a adequate small εsuch that for any τin [τ0,τ0+ε),
/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblLq0+1(Σx,τ)≤1
2,/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblLp0+1(Σy,τ)≤1
2.
In fact, the estimates is similar to ( 3.11), it holds that
/ba∇dblu−uτ/ba∇dblLp0+1(Σuy,τ)= 0,/ba∇dblv−vτ/ba∇dblLq0+1(Σvx,τ)= 0.
Based on the above discussion, we conclude that Σu
y,τand Σv
x,τmust be empty set. This
proves (3.15) and hence ( 3.13).
Ifτ0= 0, then we can make full use of the same ways in the opposite direct ion. Indeed, we
will get two situations. If the plane Tτstop at some point before the origin, we can deduce
thatu(y) andv(x) must be symmetric and monotone decreasing in the x1-direction based
on the previous analysis. If it stays at the origin again, we also have t he symmetry and
monotonicity result with x1= 0. Sincex1direction can be chosen arbitrarily, we deduce that
u(y) andv(x)|∂Rn
+must be radially symmetry and monotone decreasing about some poin t
y0∈∂Rn
+. The proof is accomplished. /BoxSTEIN-WEISS TYPE INEQUALITY 21

5.Application to nonlocal elliptic equation on the upper half s pace
In this section, as an application of Stein-Weiss type inequality ( 1.7), we are interested in
studying the symmetry and non-existence of positive solutions for the equations ( 1.15) by the
method of moving plane in half space. In fact, for Hartree type equ ations, due to the fact
that the nonlinearities are of nonlocal forms, this fact implies that t his method is not able to
use directly because of the lack of the maximum principles. However, with the help of the
integral inequality, we can continue to establish the symmetry and n on-existence of weakly
solutions for the equations ( 1.15) via moving plane arguments. For convenience, we ﬁrstly
write
m(x) =ˆ
∂Rn
+F(u(y))
|x|β|x−y|µ|y|αdy, η (y) =ˆ
Rn
+G(u(x))xλ
n
|x|β|x−y|µ|y|αdx, (5.1)STEIN-WEISS TYPE INEQUALITY 23
then the equations ( 1.15) can be rewritten by the following form,


−∆u(x) =xλ
nm(x)g(u(x)), x∈Rn
+,
∂u
∂υ(y) =η(y)f(u(y)), y∈∂Rn
+.(5.2)
Next, It should be noted that, due to the lack of the decay proper ty of those solutions, we
fail to prove symmetry and nonexistence results for the equation s (1.15) via moving plane
argumentsdirectly. Inordertoovercomethisdiﬃculty, wewillintro ducetheKelvintransform
of centered at a point. Then let us take any point xp∈∂Rn
+and deﬁne the Kelvin transform
ofu(x),m(x) andη(y) as follows.
v(x) =1
|x−xρ|n−2u/parenleftbiggx−xρ
|x−xρ|2+xρ/parenrightbigg
, ω(x) =1
|x−xρ|2β+µm/parenleftbiggx−xρ
|x−xρ|2+xρ/parenrightbigg
,
z(y) =1
|y−yρ|2α+µη/parenleftbiggy−yρ
|y−yρ|2+yρ/parenrightbigg
.
Obviously, by the above deﬁnition, for |x−xp| ≥1, we have
v(x)≤C
|x−xp|n−2, ω(x)≤C
|x−xp|2β+µ,
and
z(y)≤C
|y−yp|2α+µ. (5.3)
It’s easy to ﬁnd that ( v,ω,z) has the singularities at point xp. Here and the rest of this paper,
without loss of generality, we take xp= 0.
In addition, by a straightforward computation, we obtain v(x), ω(x), z(y) satisﬁes the
following elliptic system

Therefore, we will turn attention to studying the symmetry and mo notonicity of v(x). More-

In the light of the above preparations, we shall give two basic inequa lity, which is useful in
the later proof.

Next, in order to remove the singularity of v(x),ω(x) andz(y), we need to introduce a

Clearly, the integral I2can be estimate as we did in the previous calculation. Therefore,
fory∈∂Σv

In a similar way, we can divide the domain ∂Σv

and
Ω4={y∈∂Σv

In fact, based on the above discussion, we focus on estimating the ﬁve integrals in the

Further, according to Lemma 5.1and Lemma 5.2, for anyx∈Σδandy∈∂Σδ, we obtain
ω(x)≤ω(xδ),z(y)≤z(yδ) andv(x)≤vδ(x). /square
It should be noted that, the above analysis provides the starting p oint to move the plane
Tδ0. Now we are ready to move the plane from the right to the left provid ed (5.18). To state30 X. LI, Z. SHEN, M. SQUASSINA, AND M. YANG
the process accurately, we write
δ1= inf/braceleftbig
δ|ω(x)≤ω(xδ), z(y)≤z(yδ), v(x)≤vδ(x),∀x∈Σδ,∀y∈∂Σδ/bracerightbig
.(5.19)
Then we deduce the following important result.
Lemma 5.4. Ifδ1>0, then for any x∈Σδ1andy∈∂Σδ1, it holds that ω(x)≡ω(xδ1),
z(y)≡z(yδ1)andv(x)≡vδ1(x).
Proof.Suppose that ω(x)/\e}atio\slash≡ω(xδ1),z(y)/\e}atio\slash≡z(yδ1) andv(x)/\e}atio\slash≡vδ1(x). On one hand, by means
of the continuity of ω(x),v(x) andz(y), for anyx∈Σδ1andy∈∂Σδ1, we have
ω(x)≤ω(xδ1), v(x)≤vδ1(x), z(y)≤z(yδ1). (5.20)
Moreover, from the monotonicity of gandk, we know

which immediately implies that
−∆v(x)≤ −∆v(xδ1), x∈Σδ1.
Furthermore, according to the strong maximum principle, for any x∈Σδ1andy∈∂Σδ1, we
obtainω(x)<ω(xδ1),v(x)<vδ1(x) andz(y)<z(yδ1).
On the other hand, when δ→δ1, we get1
|x|2nχΣv
δa.e.−→0 and1
|y|2(n−1)χ∂Σv
δa.e.−→0. Therefore,
there exists τ >0 such that for δ∈[δ1−τ,δ1],1

Finally, using the decay properties of ω(x),z(y) andv(x), we point out that there exists

Therefore, by using Lemma 5.1and Lemma 5.2, we have for any δ∈[δ1−τ0,δ1],
ω(x)≤ω(xδ), v(x)≤vδ(x), z(y)≤z(yδ), x∈Σδ, y∈∂Σδ,STEIN-WEISS TYPE INEQUALITY 31
which contradicts the deﬁnition of δ1. The proof is ﬁnished. /square
It’s clear that, the proof of Theorem 1.10relies on the above results.
Proof of Theorem 1.10.In fact, we can move the plane Tδfrom∞to the left, and
continue this proof until δ=δ1. Ifδ1>p1, then we obtain
ω(x)≡ω(xδ1), z(y)≡z(yδ1), v(x)≡vδ1(x), x∈Σδ1, y∈∂Σδ1
However, this is impossible. Therefore, we get δ1≤p1. Similarly, we can move the plane
from−∞to the right as we did in the previous discussion, then we derive δ′
1andδ′
1≥p1.
Furthermore, we conclude δ1=δ′
1=p1. Sincex1direction can be taken arbitrarily, then
the fact implies that, ω(x),v(x) andz(y) are symmetric with respect to any plane, which is
passing through pand perpendicular to xi(i= 1,2...n−1) axis.
Finally, for any p∈∂Rn
+,v(x),ω(x) andz(y) are symmetric about the plane that passing
throughpand is parallel to xnaxis. Hence we derive that u(x) andm(x) depend only on xn
andηis constant. This proof is accomplished. /Box
Next, we will pay attention to study the existence of positive solutio n for Hartree type
equations ( 1.15). By virtue of Theorem 1.10, we give the proof of Corollary 1.11.
Proof of Corollary 1.11.Naturally, according to Theorem 1.10, we conclude that m(x),
u(x) depend only xnandη(y) is constant function. As a consequence, we can rewrite the
equations ( 1.15) in the following form


−d2u(xn)

f(u(0)),
It is worth noting that the ﬁrst equation yield u(x) is concave function. Moreover, from
the later equation, we have
du
dxn(0) =/parenleftBiggˆ
Rn
+G(u(xn))xλ
n
|x−y|µdx/parenrightBigg
f(u(0))≥0.
Thus, we conclude that u(x) is concave and decreasing unless u≡˜cwithF(˜c) =G(˜c) = 0.
On the one hand, if uis strictly decreasing with respect to xn, then we havedu
dxn(0)≤0, which
is impossible. The fact implies that this case will not happen. Hence we im mediately deduce
the desired result. The proof is accomplished. /Box
